chapter
i
the
gray
seal
among
new
york
fashionable
and
clubs
the
james
stood
an
acknowledged
leader
more
men
perhaps
cast
an
envious
eye
at
its
portals
of
modest
and
unassuming
taste
as
they
passed
by
on
fifth
avenue
than
they
did
at
any
other
club
upon
the
long
list
that
the
city
boasts
true
there
were
more
expensive
clubs
upon
whose
membership
roll
scintillated
more
stars
of
new
york
social
set
but
the
james
was
distinctive
it
guaranteed
a
man
so
to
speak
that
is
it
guaranteed
a
man
to
be
innately
a
gentleman
it
required
money
it
is
true
to
keep
up
one
membership
but
there
were
many
members
who
were
not
wealthy
as
wealth
is
measured
nowadays
there
were
many
even
who
were
pressed
sometimes
to
meet
their
dues
and
their
house
accounts
but
the
accounts
were
invariably
promptly
paid
no
man
once
in
could
ever
afford
or
ever
had
the
desire
to
resign
from
the
james
club
its
membership
was
cosmopolitan
men
of
every
walk
in
life
passed
in
and
out
of
its
doors
professional
men
and
business
men
physicians
artists
merchants
authors
engineers
each
stamped
with
the
hall
mark
of
the
james
an
innate
gentleman
to
receive
a
two
weeks
visitor
card
to
the
james
was
something
to
speak
about
and
men
from
chicago
louis
or
san
francisco
spoke
of
it
with
a
sort
of
air
to
fellow
members
of
their
own
exclusive
clubs
at
home
again
is
there
any
doubt
that
jimmie
dale
was
a
gentleman
an
innate
gentleman
jimmie
dale
father
had
been
a
member
of
the
james
club
and
one
of
the
largest
safe
manufacturers
of
the
united
states
a
prosperous
wealthy
man
and
at
jimmie
dale
birth
he
had
proposed
his
son
name
for
membership
it
took
some
time
to
get
into
the
james
there
was
a
long
waiting
list
that
neither
money
influence
nor
pull
could
alter
by
so
much
as
one
iota
men
proposed
their
sons
names
for
membership
when
they
were
born
as
religiously
as
they
entered
them
upon
the
city
birth
register
at
jimmie
dale
was
elected
to
membership
and
incidentally
that
same
year
graduated
from
harvard
it
was
dale
desire
that
his
son
should
enter
the
business
and
learn
it
from
the
ground
up
and
jimmie
dale
for
four
years
thereafter
had
followed
his
father
wishes
then
his
father
died
jimmie
dale
had
leanings
toward
more
artistic
pursuits
than
business
he
was
credited
with
sketching
a
little
writing
a
little
and
he
was
credited
with
having
received
a
very
snug
amount
from
the
combine
to
which
he
sold
out
his
interests
he
lived
a
bachelor
life
his
mother
had
been
dead
many
years
in
the
house
that
his
father
had
left
him
on
riverside
drive
kept
a
car
or
two
and
enough
servants
to
run
his
menage
smoothly
and
serve
a
dinner
exquisitely
when
he
felt
hospitably
inclined
could
there
be
any
doubt
that
jimmie
dale
was
innately
a
gentleman
it
was
evening
and
jimmie
dale
sat
at
a
small
table
in
the
corner
of
the
james
club
dining
room
opposite
him
sat
herman
carruthers
a
young
man
of
his
own
age
about
a
leading
figure
in
the
newspaper
world
whose
rise
from
reporter
to
managing
editor
of
the
morning
within
the
short
space
of
a
few
years
had
been
almost
meteoric
they
were
at
coffee
and
cigars
and
jimmie
dale
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
his
dark
eyes
fixed
interestedly
on
his
guest
carruthers
intently
engaged
in
trimming
his
cigar
ash
on
the
edge
of
the
limoges
china
saucer
of
his
coffee
set
looked
up
with
an
abrupt
laugh
no
i
would
care
to
go
on
record
as
being
an
advocate
of
crime
he
said
whimsically
that
would
never
do
but
i
do
mind
admitting
quite
privately
that
it
been
a
positive
regret
to
me
that
he
has
made
too
good
to
lose
i
suppose
suggested
jimmie
dale
quizzically
too
bad
too
after
working
up
a
theatrical
name
like
that
for
him
the
gray
seal
rather
unique
who
stuck
that
on
him
you
carruthers
laughed
then
grown
serious
leaned
toward
jimmie
dale
you
do
mean
to
say
jimmie
that
you
do
know
about
that
do
you
he
asked
incredulously
why
up
to
a
year
ago
the
papers
were
full
of
i
never
read
your
beastly
agony
columns
said
jimmie
dale
with
a
cheery
grin
well
said
carruthers
you
must
have
skipped
everything
but
the
stock
reports
granted
said
jimmie
dale
so
go
on
carruthers
and
tell
me
about
him
i
dare
say
i
may
have
heard
of
him
since
you
are
so
distressed
about
it
but
my
memory
is
good
enough
to
contradict
anything
you
may
have
to
say
about
the
estimable
gentleman
so
you
carruthers
reverted
to
the
limoges
saucer
and
the
tip
of
his
cigar
he
was
the
most
puzzling
bewildering
delightful
crook
in
the
annals
of
crime
said
carruthers
reminiscently
after
a
moment
silence
jimmie
he
was
the
of
them
all
clever
is
the
word
for
him
or
is
either
i
used
to
think
sometimes
his
motive
was
more
than
half
for
the
pure
deviltry
of
it
to
laugh
at
the
police
and
pull
the
noses
of
the
rest
of
us
that
were
after
him
i
used
to
dream
nights
about
those
confounded
gray
seals
of
his
that
where
he
got
his
name
he
left
every
job
he
ever
did
with
a
little
gray
paper
affair
fashioned
stuck
somewhere
where
it
would
be
the
first
thing
your
eyes
would
light
upon
when
you
reached
the
scene
and
do
go
so
fast
smiled
jimmie
dale
i
do
quite
get
the
connection
what
did
you
have
to
do
with
this
er
gray
seal
fellow
where
do
you
come
in
i
i
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
him
said
carruthers
grimly
i
was
a
reporter
when
he
first
broke
loose
and
the
ambition
of
my
life
after
i
began
really
to
appreciate
what
he
was
was
to
get
him
and
i
nearly
did
half
a
dozen
times
only
only
you
never
quite
did
eh
cut
in
jimmie
dale
slyly
how
near
did
you
get
old
man
come
on
now
no
bluffing
did
the
gray
seal
ever
even
recognise
you
as
a
factor
in
the
game
you
flicking
on
the
raw
jimmie
carruthers
answered
with
a
wry
grimace
he
knew
me
all
right
confound
him
he
favoured
me
with
several
sarcastic
notes
i
show
to
you
some
day
explaining
how
i
fallen
down
and
how
i
could
have
got
him
if
i
done
something
carruthers
fist
came
suddenly
down
on
the
table
and
i
would
have
got
him
too
if
he
had
lived
ejaculated
jimmie
dale
he
dead
then
yes
averted
carruthers
he
h
said
jimmie
dale
facetiously
i
hope
the
size
of
the
wreath
you
sent
was
an
adequate
tribute
of
your
i
never
sent
any
wreath
returned
carruthers
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
i
did
know
where
to
send
it
or
when
he
died
i
said
he
was
dead
because
for
over
a
year
now
he
has
lifted
a
rotten
poor
evidence
even
for
a
newspaper
commented
jimmie
dale
why
not
give
him
credit
for
having
say
reformed
carruthers
shook
his
head
you
do
get
it
at
all
jimmie
he
said
earnestly
the
gray
seal
was
an
ordinary
crook
he
was
a
classic
he
was
an
artist
and
the
art
of
the
thing
was
in
his
blood
a
man
like
that
could
no
more
stop
than
he
could
stop
breathing
and
live
dead
there
nothing
to
it
but
that
he
dead
i
bet
a
year
salary
on
another
good
man
gone
wrong
then
said
jimmie
dale
capriciously
i
suppose
though
that
at
least
you
discovered
the
in
the
case
carruthers
looked
up
quickly
a
little
startled
then
laughed
shortly
what
the
matter
inquired
jimmie
dale
nothing
said
carruthers
you
kind
of
got
me
for
a
moment
all
that
the
way
those
infernal
notes
from
the
gray
seal
used
to
end
up
the
lady
old
chap
and
you
get
me
he
had
a
damned
patronising
familiarity
that
would
make
you
poor
old
carruthers
grinned
jimmie
dale
you
did
take
it
to
heart
did
you
i
have
sold
my
soul
to
get
him
and
so
would
you
if
you
had
been
in
my
boots
said
carruthers
biting
nervously
at
the
end
of
his
cigar
and
been
sorry
for
it
afterward
supplied
jimmie
dale
yes
by
jove
you
right
admitted
carruthers
i
suppose
i
should
i
actually
got
to
love
the
fellow
it
was
the
game
really
that
i
wanted
to
well
and
how
about
this
woman
keep
on
the
straight
and
narrow
path
old
man
prodded
jimmie
dale
the
woman
carruthers
smiled
nothing
doing
i
do
believe
there
was
one
he
would
have
been
likely
to
egg
the
police
and
reporters
on
to
finding
her
if
there
had
been
would
he
it
was
a
blind
of
course
he
worked
alone
absolutely
alone
that
the
secret
of
his
success
according
to
my
way
of
thinking
there
was
never
so
much
as
an
indication
that
he
had
had
an
accomplice
in
anything
he
ever
jimmie
dale
eyes
travelled
around
the
club
homelike
perfectly
appointed
room
he
nodded
to
a
fellow
member
here
and
there
then
his
eyes
rested
musingly
on
his
guest
again
carruthers
was
staring
thoughtfully
at
his
coffee
cup
he
was
the
prince
of
crooks
and
the
father
of
originality
announced
carruthers
abruptly
following
the
pause
that
had
ensued
half
the
time
there
was
any
more
getting
at
the
motive
for
the
curious
things
he
did
than
there
was
getting
at
the
gray
seal
carruthers
said
jimmy
dale
with
a
quick
little
nod
of
approval
you
positively
interesting
but
so
far
you
been
kind
of
scouting
around
the
outside
edges
without
getting
into
the
thick
of
it
let
have
some
of
your
experiences
with
the
gray
seal
in
detail
they
ought
to
make
ripping
fine
not
jimmie
said
carruthers
it
would
take
too
he
pulled
out
his
watch
mechanically
as
he
spoke
glanced
at
it
and
pushed
back
his
chair
great
scott
he
exclaimed
it
nearly
nine
i
no
idea
we
had
lingered
so
long
over
dinner
i
have
to
hurry
we
a
morning
paper
you
know
what
really
is
it
as
late
as
jimmie
dale
rose
from
his
chair
as
carruthers
stood
up
well
if
you
must
i
must
said
carruthers
with
a
laugh
all
right
o
jimmie
dale
laughed
back
and
slipped
his
hand
a
trick
of
their
old
college
days
together
through
carruthers
arm
as
they
left
the
room
he
accompanied
carruthers
downstairs
to
the
door
of
the
club
and
saw
his
guest
into
a
taxi
then
he
returned
inside
sauntered
through
the
billiard
room
and
from
there
into
one
of
the
cardrooms
where
pressed
into
a
game
he
played
several
rubbers
of
bridge
before
going
home
it
was
therefore
well
on
toward
midnight
when
jimmie
dale
arrived
at
his
house
on
riverside
drive
and
was
admitted
by
an
elderly
manservant
hello
jason
said
jimmie
dale
pleasantly
you
still
up
yes
sir
replied
jason
who
had
been
valet
to
jimmie
dale
father
before
him
i
was
going
to
bed
sir
at
about
ten
when
a
messenger
came
with
a
letter
begging
your
pardon
sir
a
young
lady
and
jason
jimmie
dale
flung
out
the
interruption
sudden
quick
imperative
what
did
she
look
like
why
why
i
do
exactly
know
as
i
could
describe
her
sir
stammered
jason
taken
aback
very
ladylike
sir
in
her
dress
and
appearance
and
what
i
would
call
sir
a
beautiful
hair
and
eyes
what
color
demanded
jimmie
dale
crisply
nose
lips
chin
what
shape
why
sir
gasped
jason
staring
at
his
master
i
i
do
rightly
know
i
would
call
her
fair
or
dark
something
between
i
did
take
particular
notice
and
it
was
overlight
outside
the
it
too
bad
you
were
a
younger
man
jason
commented
jimmie
dale
with
a
curious
tinge
of
bitterness
in
his
voice
i
have
given
a
year
income
for
your
opportunity
yes
sir
said
jason
helplessly
well
go
on
prompted
jimmie
dale
you
told
her
i
was
home
and
she
said
she
knew
it
did
she
and
she
left
the
letter
that
i
was
on
no
account
to
miss
receiving
when
i
got
back
though
there
was
no
need
of
telephoning
me
to
the
club
when
i
returned
would
do
but
it
was
imperative
that
i
should
have
it
then
eh
good
lord
sir
ejaculated
jason
his
jaw
dropped
that
exactly
what
she
did
jason
said
jimmie
dale
grimly
listen
to
me
if
ever
she
comes
here
again
inveigle
her
in
if
you
ca
inveigle
her
use
force
capture
her
pull
her
in
do
anything
do
anything
do
you
hear
only
do
let
her
get
away
from
you
until
i
jason
gazed
at
his
master
as
though
the
other
had
lost
his
reason
use
force
sir
he
repeated
weakly
and
shook
his
head
you
you
ca
mean
that
ca
i
inquired
jimmie
dale
with
a
mirthless
smile
i
mean
every
word
of
it
jason
and
if
i
thought
there
was
the
slightest
chance
of
her
giving
you
the
opportunity
i
be
more
imperative
still
as
it
is
where
the
letter
on
the
table
in
your
studio
sir
said
jason
mechanically
jimmie
dale
started
toward
the
stairs
then
turned
and
came
back
to
where
jason
still
shaking
his
head
heavily
had
been
gazing
anxiously
after
his
master
jimmie
dale
laid
his
hand
on
the
old
man
shoulder
jason
he
said
kindly
with
a
swift
change
of
mood
you
been
a
long
time
in
the
family
first
with
father
and
now
with
me
you
do
a
good
deal
for
me
would
you
i
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
master
jim
said
the
old
man
earnestly
well
then
remember
this
said
jimmie
dale
slowly
looking
into
the
other
eyes
remember
this
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
your
eyes
open
it
my
fault
i
should
have
warned
you
long
ago
but
i
never
dreamed
that
she
would
ever
come
here
herself
there
have
been
times
when
it
was
practically
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
me
to
know
who
that
woman
is
that
you
saw
that
all
jason
now
go
to
master
jim
said
the
old
man
simply
thank
you
sir
thank
you
for
trusting
me
i
dandled
you
on
my
knee
when
you
were
a
baby
master
jim
i
do
know
what
it
about
and
it
is
for
me
to
ask
i
thought
sir
that
maybe
you
were
having
a
little
fun
with
me
but
i
know
now
and
you
can
trust
me
master
jim
if
she
ever
comes
thank
you
jason
said
jimmie
dale
his
hand
closing
with
an
appreciative
pressure
on
the
other
shoulder
upstairs
on
the
first
landing
jimmie
dale
opened
a
door
closed
and
locked
it
behind
him
and
the
electric
switch
clicked
under
his
fingers
a
glow
fell
softly
from
a
cluster
of
shaded
ceiling
lights
it
was
a
large
room
a
very
large
room
running
the
entire
depth
of
the
house
and
the
effect
of
apparent
disorder
in
the
arrangement
of
its
appointments
seemed
to
breathe
a
sense
of
charm
there
were
great
cozy
deep
lounging
chairs
a
huge
davenport
and
an
easel
or
two
with
sketches
upon
them
the
walls
were
panelled
the
panels
of
exquisite
grain
and
matching
in
the
centre
of
the
room
stood
a
rosewood
desk
upon
the
floor
was
a
dark
heavy
velvet
rug
and
perhaps
most
inviting
of
all
there
was
a
great
fireplace
at
one
side
of
the
room
for
an
instant
jimmie
dale
remained
quietly
by
the
door
as
though
listening
six
feet
he
stood
muscular
in
every
line
of
his
body
like
a
athlete
with
no
single
ounce
of
superfluous
fat
about
him
the
grace
and
ease
of
power
in
his
poise
his
strong
face
as
the
light
fell
upon
it
now
was
serious
a
mood
that
became
him
well
the
firm
lips
closed
the
dark
reliant
eyes
a
little
narrowed
a
frown
on
the
broad
forehead
the
square
jaw
clamped
then
abruptly
he
walked
across
the
room
to
the
desk
picked
up
an
envelope
that
lay
upon
it
and
turning
again
dropped
into
the
nearest
lounging
chair
there
had
been
no
doubt
in
his
mind
none
to
dispel
it
was
precisely
what
he
had
expected
from
almost
the
first
word
jason
had
spoken
it
was
the
same
handwriting
the
same
texture
of
paper
and
there
was
the
same
old
haunting
rare
indefinable
fragrance
about
it
jimmie
hands
turned
the
envelope
now
this
way
now
that
as
he
looked
at
it
wonderful
hands
were
jimmie
dale
with
long
slim
tapering
fingers
whose
sensitive
tips
seemed
now
as
though
they
were
striving
to
decipher
the
message
within
he
laughed
suddenly
a
little
harshly
and
tore
open
the
envelope
five
closely
written
sheets
fell
into
his
hand
he
read
them
slowly
critically
read
them
over
again
and
then
his
eyes
on
the
rug
at
his
feet
he
began
to
tear
the
paper
into
minute
pieces
between
his
fingers
depositing
the
pieces
as
he
tore
them
upon
the
arm
of
his
chair
the
five
sheets
demolished
his
fingers
dipped
into
the
heap
of
shreds
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
tore
them
over
and
over
again
tore
them
until
they
were
scarcely
larger
than
bits
of
confetti
tore
at
them
absently
and
mechanically
his
eyes
never
shifting
from
the
rug
at
his
feet
then
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
as
though
rousing
himself
to
present
reality
a
curious
smile
flickering
on
his
lips
he
brushed
the
pieces
of
paper
into
one
hand
carried
them
to
the
empty
fireplace
laid
them
down
in
a
little
pile
and
set
them
afire
lighting
a
cigarette
he
watched
them
burn
until
the
last
glow
had
gone
from
the
last
charred
scrap
then
he
crunched
and
scattered
them
with
the
fender
brush
and
retracing
his
steps
across
the
room
flung
back
a
portiere
from
where
it
hung
before
a
little
alcove
and
dropped
on
his
knees
in
front
of
a
round
squat
safe
one
of
his
own
design
and
planning
in
the
years
when
he
had
been
with
his
father
his
slim
sensitive
fingers
played
for
an
instant
among
the
knobs
and
dials
that
studded
the
door
guided
it
seemed
by
the
sense
of
touch
alone
and
the
door
swung
open
within
was
another
door
with
locks
and
bolts
as
intricate
and
massive
as
the
outer
one
this
too
he
opened
and
then
from
the
interior
took
out
a
short
thick
leather
bundle
tied
together
with
thongs
he
rose
from
his
knees
closed
the
safe
and
drew
the
portiere
across
the
alcove
again
with
the
bundle
under
his
arm
he
glanced
sharply
around
the
room
listened
intently
then
unlocking
the
door
that
gave
on
the
hall
he
switched
off
the
lights
and
went
to
his
dressing
room
that
was
on
the
same
floor
here
divesting
himself
quickly
of
his
dinner
clothes
he
selected
a
dark
tweed
suit
with
sack
coat
from
his
wardrobe
and
began
to
put
it
on
dressed
all
but
his
coat
and
vest
he
turned
to
the
leather
bundle
that
he
had
placed
on
a
table
untied
the
thongs
and
carefully
opened
it
out
to
its
full
length
and
again
that
curious
cryptic
smile
tinged
his
lips
rolled
the
opposite
away
from
that
in
which
it
had
been
tied
up
the
leather
strip
made
a
wide
belt
that
went
on
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
a
life
preserver
the
thongs
being
used
for
shoulder
straps
a
belt
that
once
on
the
vest
would
hide
completely
and
fitting
close
left
no
telltale
bulge
in
the
outer
garments
it
was
not
an
ordinary
belt
it
was
full
of
little
pockets
all
the
way
around
and
in
the
pockets
grimly
lay
an
array
of
fine
highly
tempered
instruments
a
compact
powerful
kit
the
slim
sensitive
fingers
passed
with
almost
a
caressing
touch
over
the
vicious
little
implements
and
from
one
of
the
pockets
extracted
a
thin
flat
metal
case
this
jimmie
dale
opened
and
glanced
inside
between
sheets
of
oil
paper
lay
little
rows
of
gray
adhesive
seals
jimmie
dale
snapped
the
case
shut
returned
it
to
its
recess
and
from
another
took
out
a
black
silk
mask
he
held
it
up
to
the
light
for
examination
pretty
good
shape
after
a
year
muttered
jimmie
dale
replacing
it
he
put
on
the
belt
then
his
vest
and
coat
from
the
drawer
of
his
dresser
he
took
an
automatic
revolver
and
an
electric
flashlight
slipped
them
into
his
pocket
and
went
softly
downstairs
from
the
hat
stand
he
chose
a
black
slouch
hat
pulled
it
well
over
his
eyes
and
left
the
house
jimmie
dale
walked
down
a
block
then
hailed
a
bus
and
mounted
to
the
top
it
was
late
and
he
found
himself
the
only
passenger
he
inserted
his
dime
in
the
conductor
little
cash
receiver
and
then
settled
back
on
the
uncomfortable
bumping
cushionless
seat
on
rattled
the
bus
it
turned
across
town
passed
the
circle
and
headed
for
fifth
avenue
but
jimmie
dale
to
all
appearances
was
quite
oblivious
of
its
movements
it
was
a
year
since
she
had
written
him
she
jimmie
dale
did
not
smile
his
lips
were
pressed
hard
together
not
a
very
intimate
or
personal
appellation
that
but
he
knew
her
by
no
other
it
was
a
woman
surely
the
was
feminine
the
diction
eminently
so
and
had
she
not
come
herself
that
night
to
jason
he
remembered
the
last
letter
apart
from
the
one
that
he
had
received
from
her
it
was
a
year
ago
now
and
the
letter
had
been
hardly
more
than
a
note
the
police
had
worked
themselves
into
a
frenzy
over
the
gray
seal
the
papers
had
grown
absolutely
maudlin
and
she
had
written
in
her
characteristic
way
things
are
a
little
too
warm
are
they
jimmie
let
let
them
cool
for
a
year
since
then
until
he
had
heard
nothing
from
her
it
was
a
strange
compact
that
he
had
entered
into
so
strange
that
it
could
never
have
known
could
never
know
a
parallel
unique
dangerous
bizarre
it
was
all
that
and
more
it
had
begun
really
through
his
connection
with
his
father
business
the
business
of
manufacturing
safes
that
should
defy
the
cleverest
criminals
when
his
brains
turned
into
that
channel
had
been
pitted
against
the
underworld
against
the
methods
of
a
thousand
different
crooks
from
maine
to
california
the
report
of
whose
every
operation
had
reached
him
in
the
natural
course
of
business
and
every
one
of
which
he
had
studied
in
minutest
detail
it
had
begun
through
that
but
at
the
bottom
of
it
was
his
own
restless
adventurous
spirit
he
had
meant
to
set
the
police
by
the
ears
using
his
device
both
as
an
added
barb
and
that
no
innocent
bystander
of
the
underworld
innocent
for
once
might
be
involved
he
had
meant
to
laugh
at
them
and
puzzle
them
to
the
verge
of
madness
for
in
the
last
analysis
they
would
find
only
an
abortive
attempt
at
crime
and
he
had
succeeded
and
then
he
had
gone
too
far
and
he
had
been
caught
by
her
that
string
of
pearls
which
to
study
whose
effect
facetiously
he
had
so
idiotically
wrapped
around
his
wrist
and
which
so
ironically
he
had
been
unable
to
loosen
in
time
and
had
been
forced
to
carry
with
him
in
his
sudden
desperate
dash
to
escape
from
marx
the
big
jeweler
in
maiden
lane
whose
strong
room
he
had
toyed
with
one
night
had
been
the
lever
which
at
first
she
had
held
over
him
the
bus
was
on
fifth
avenue
now
and
speeding
rapidly
down
the
deserted
thoroughfare
jimmie
dale
looked
up
at
the
lighted
windows
of
the
james
club
as
they
went
by
smiled
whimsically
and
shifted
in
his
seat
seeking
a
more
comfortable
position
she
had
caught
him
how
he
did
not
know
he
had
never
seen
her
did
not
know
who
she
was
though
time
and
again
he
had
devoted
all
his
energies
for
months
at
a
stretch
to
a
solution
of
the
mystery
the
morning
following
the
maiden
lane
affair
indeed
before
he
had
breakfasted
jason
had
brought
him
the
first
letter
from
her
it
had
started
by
detailing
his
every
move
of
the
night
before
and
it
had
ended
with
an
ultimatum
the
cleverness
the
originality
of
the
gray
seal
as
a
crook
lacked
but
one
thing
she
had
naively
written
and
that
one
thing
was
that
his
crookedness
required
a
leading
string
to
guide
it
into
channels
that
were
worthy
of
his
in
a
word
she
would
plan
the
coups
and
he
would
act
at
her
dictation
and
execute
them
or
else
how
did
twenty
years
in
sing
sing
for
that
little
maiden
lane
affair
appeal
to
him
he
was
to
answer
by
the
next
morning
a
simple
yes
or
no
in
the
personal
column
of
the
morning
a
threat
to
a
man
like
jimmie
dale
was
like
flaunting
a
red
rag
at
a
bull
and
a
rage
ungovernable
had
surged
upon
him
then
cold
reason
had
come
he
was
caught
there
was
no
question
about
that
she
had
taken
pains
to
show
him
that
he
need
make
no
mistake
there
innocent
enough
in
his
own
conscience
as
far
as
actual
theft
went
for
the
pearls
would
in
due
course
be
restored
in
some
way
to
the
possession
of
their
owner
he
would
have
been
unable
to
make
even
his
own
father
who
was
alive
then
believe
in
his
innocence
let
alone
a
jury
of
his
peers
dishonour
shame
ignominy
a
long
prison
sentence
stared
him
in
the
face
and
there
was
but
one
alternative
to
link
hands
with
this
unseen
mysterious
accomplice
well
he
could
at
least
temporise
he
could
always
queer
a
game
in
some
specious
manner
if
he
were
pushed
too
far
and
so
in
the
next
morning
jimmie
dale
had
answered
and
then
had
followed
those
years
in
which
there
had
been
no
temporising
in
which
every
plan
was
carried
out
to
the
last
detail
those
years
of
curious
unaccountable
bewildering
affairs
that
carruthers
had
spoken
of
one
on
top
of
another
that
had
shaken
the
old
headquarters
on
mulberry
street
to
its
foundations
until
the
gray
seal
had
become
a
name
to
conjure
with
and
yes
it
was
quite
true
he
had
entered
into
it
all
gone
the
limit
with
an
eagerness
that
was
insatiable
the
bus
had
reached
the
lower
end
of
fifth
avenue
passed
through
washington
square
and
stopped
at
the
end
of
its
run
jimmie
dale
clambered
down
from
the
top
threw
a
pleasant
to
the
conductor
and
headed
briskly
down
the
street
before
him
a
little
later
he
crossed
into
west
broadway
and
his
pace
slowed
to
a
leisurely
stroll
here
at
the
upper
end
of
the
street
was
a
conglomerate
business
section
of
rather
inferior
class
catering
doubtless
to
the
poor
foreign
element
that
congregated
west
of
broadway
proper
and
to
the
south
of
washington
square
the
street
was
at
first
glance
deserted
it
was
dark
and
dreary
with
stores
and
lofts
on
either
side
an
elevated
train
roared
by
overhead
with
a
thunderous
deafening
clamour
jimmie
dale
on
the
side
of
the
street
glanced
interestedly
at
the
dark
store
windows
as
he
went
by
and
then
a
block
ahead
on
the
other
side
his
eyes
rested
on
an
approaching
form
as
the
other
reached
the
corner
and
paused
and
the
light
from
the
street
lamp
glinted
on
brass
buttons
jimmie
dale
eyes
narrowed
a
little
under
his
slouch
hat
the
policeman
although
nonchalantly
swinging
a
nightstick
appeared
to
be
watching
him
jimmie
dale
went
on
half
a
block
farther
stooped
to
the
sidewalk
to
tie
his
shoe
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
the
policeman
was
not
in
sight
and
slipped
like
a
shadow
into
the
alleyway
beside
which
he
had
stopped
it
was
another
jimmie
dale
now
the
professional
jimmie
dale
quick
as
a
cat
active
lithe
he
was
over
a
six
foot
fence
in
the
rear
of
a
building
in
a
flash
and
crouched
a
black
shape
against
the
back
door
of
an
unpretentious
unkempt
dirty
secondhand
shop
that
fronted
on
west
broadway
the
last
place
certainly
in
all
new
york
that
the
managing
editor
of
the
or
any
one
else
for
that
matter
would
have
picked
out
as
the
setting
for
the
second
debut
of
the
gray
seal
from
the
belt
around
his
waist
jimmie
dale
took
the
black
silk
mask
and
slipped
it
on
and
from
the
belt
too
came
a
little
instrument
that
his
deft
fingers
manipulated
in
the
lock
a
curious
snipping
sound
followed
jimmie
dale
put
his
weight
gradually
against
the
door
the
door
held
fast
bolted
said
jimmie
dale
to
himself
the
sensitive
fingers
travelled
slowly
up
and
down
the
side
of
the
door
seeming
to
press
and
feel
for
the
position
of
the
bolt
through
an
inch
of
plank
then
from
the
belt
came
a
tiny
saw
thin
and
pointed
at
the
end
that
fitted
into
the
little
handle
drawn
from
another
receptacle
in
the
leather
girdle
beneath
the
unbuttoned
vest
hardly
a
sound
it
made
as
it
bit
into
the
door
half
a
minute
passed
there
was
the
faint
fall
of
a
small
piece
of
wood
into
the
aperture
crept
the
delicate
tapering
fingers
came
a
slight
rasping
of
metal
then
the
door
swung
back
the
dark
shadow
that
had
been
jimmie
dale
vanished
and
the
door
closed
again
a
round
white
beam
of
light
glowed
for
an
instant
and
disappeared
a
miscellaneous
lumbering
collection
of
junk
and
odds
and
ends
blocked
the
entry
leaving
no
more
space
than
was
sufficient
for
bare
passageway
jimmie
dale
moved
cautiously
and
once
more
the
flashlight
in
his
hand
showed
the
way
for
an
instant
then
darkness
again
the
cluttered
accumulation
of
secondhand
stuff
in
the
rear
gave
place
to
a
little
more
orderly
arrangement
as
he
advanced
toward
the
front
of
the
store
like
a
huge
firefly
the
flashlight
twinkled
went
out
twinkled
again
and
went
out
he
passed
a
sort
of
crude
apartment
that
did
duty
for
the
establishment
office
a
sort
of
little
place
it
was
about
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
jimmie
light
played
on
it
for
a
moment
but
he
kept
on
toward
the
front
door
without
any
pause
every
movement
was
quick
sure
accurate
with
not
a
wasted
second
it
had
been
barely
a
minute
since
he
had
vaulted
the
back
fence
it
was
hardly
a
quarter
of
a
minute
more
before
the
cumbersome
lock
of
the
front
door
was
unfastened
and
the
door
itself
pulled
imperceptibly
ajar
he
went
swiftly
back
to
the
office
now
and
found
it
even
more
of
a
shaky
cheap
affair
than
it
had
at
first
appeared
more
like
a
box
stall
with
windows
around
the
top
than
anything
else
the
windows
doubtless
to
permit
the
occupant
to
overlook
the
store
from
the
vantage
point
of
the
high
stool
that
stood
before
a
long
battered
wobbly
desk
there
was
a
door
to
the
place
too
but
the
door
was
open
and
the
key
was
in
the
lock
the
ray
of
jimmie
dale
flashlight
swept
once
around
the
interior
and
rested
on
an
antique
ponderous
safe
under
the
mask
jimmie
dale
lips
parted
in
a
smile
that
seemed
almost
apologetic
as
he
viewed
the
helpless
iron
monstrosity
that
was
little
more
than
an
insult
to
a
trained
cracksman
then
from
the
belt
came
the
thin
metal
case
and
a
pair
of
tweezers
he
opened
the
case
and
with
the
tweezers
lifted
out
one
of
the
seals
holding
the
seal
with
the
tweezers
he
moistened
the
gummed
side
with
his
lips
then
laid
it
on
a
handkerchief
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
and
clapped
the
handkerchief
against
the
front
of
the
safe
sticking
the
seal
conspicuously
into
place
jimmie
dale
insignia
bore
no
finger
prints
the
microscopes
and
magnifying
glasses
at
headquarters
had
many
a
time
regretfully
assured
the
police
of
that
fact
and
now
his
hands
and
fingers
seemed
to
work
like
lightning
into
the
soft
iron
bit
a
drill
bit
in
and
through
bit
in
and
through
again
it
was
dark
pitch
black
and
silent
not
a
sound
save
the
quick
dull
rasp
of
the
ratchet
like
the
distant
gnawing
of
a
mouse
jimmie
dale
worked
fast
another
hole
went
through
the
face
of
the
safe
and
then
suddenly
he
straightened
up
to
listen
every
faculty
tense
alert
and
strained
his
body
thrown
a
little
forward
what
was
that
from
the
alleyway
leading
from
the
street
without
through
which
he
himself
had
come
sounded
the
stealthy
crunch
of
feet
motionless
in
the
utter
darkness
jimmie
dale
listened
there
was
a
scraping
noise
in
the
rear
someone
was
climbing
the
fence
that
he
had
climbed
in
an
instant
the
tools
in
jimmie
dale
hands
disappeared
into
their
respective
pockets
beneath
his
vest
and
the
sensitive
fingers
shot
to
the
dial
on
the
safe
too
bad
muttered
jimmie
dale
plaintively
to
himself
i
could
have
made
such
an
artistic
job
of
it
i
swear
i
could
have
cut
profile
in
the
hole
in
less
than
no
time
to
open
it
like
this
is
really
taking
the
poor
old
thing
at
a
he
was
on
his
knees
now
one
ear
close
to
the
dial
listening
as
the
tumblers
fell
while
the
delicate
fingers
spun
the
knob
unerringly
the
other
ear
strained
toward
the
rear
of
the
premises
came
a
footstep
a
ray
of
light
a
stumble
nearer
the
newcomer
was
inside
the
place
now
and
must
have
found
out
that
the
back
door
had
been
tampered
with
nearer
came
the
steps
still
nearer
and
then
the
safe
door
swung
open
under
jimmie
dale
hand
and
jimmie
dale
that
he
might
not
be
caught
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
darted
from
the
office
but
he
had
delayed
a
little
too
long
from
around
the
cluttered
piles
of
junk
and
miscellany
swept
the
light
full
on
jimmie
dale
hesitation
for
the
smallest
fraction
of
a
second
would
have
been
fatal
but
hesitation
was
something
that
in
all
his
life
jimmie
dale
had
never
known
quick
as
a
panther
in
its
spring
he
leaped
full
at
the
light
and
the
man
behind
it
the
rough
voice
in
surprised
exclamation
at
the
sudden
discovery
of
the
quarry
died
in
a
gasp
there
was
a
crash
as
the
two
men
met
and
the
other
reeled
back
before
the
impact
onto
him
jimmie
dale
sprang
and
his
hands
flew
for
the
other
throat
it
was
an
officer
in
uniform
jimmie
dale
had
felt
the
brass
buttons
as
they
locked
in
the
darkness
there
was
a
queer
smile
on
jimmie
dale
tight
lips
it
was
no
doubt
the
officer
whom
he
had
passed
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
the
other
was
a
smaller
man
than
jimmie
dale
but
powerful
for
his
build
and
he
fought
now
with
all
his
strength
this
way
and
that
the
two
men
reeled
staggered
swayed
panting
and
gasping
and
then
they
had
lurched
back
close
to
the
office
door
with
a
sudden
swing
every
muscle
brought
into
play
for
a
supreme
effort
jimmie
dale
hurled
the
other
from
him
sending
the
man
sprawling
back
to
the
floor
of
the
office
and
in
the
winking
of
an
eye
had
slammed
shut
the
door
and
turned
the
key
there
was
a
roar
the
shrill
of
the
patrolman
whistle
and
a
shattering
crash
as
the
officer
flung
his
body
against
the
partition
then
the
bark
of
a
revolver
shot
the
tinkle
of
breaking
glass
as
the
man
fired
through
the
office
window
and
past
jimmie
dale
speeding
now
for
the
front
door
a
bullet
hummed
viciously
out
on
the
street
dashed
jimmie
dale
whipping
the
mask
from
his
face
and
glanced
like
a
hawk
around
him
for
all
the
racket
the
neighbourhood
had
not
yet
been
aroused
no
one
was
in
sight
from
just
overhead
came
the
rattle
of
a
downtown
elevated
train
in
a
sprint
jimmie
dale
raced
it
a
half
block
to
the
station
tore
up
the
steps
and
a
moment
later
dropped
nonchalantly
into
a
seat
and
pulled
an
evening
newspaper
from
his
pocket
jimmie
dale
got
off
at
the
second
station
down
crossed
the
street
mounted
the
steps
of
the
elevated
again
and
took
the
next
train
uptown
his
movements
appeared
to
be
somewhat
erratic
he
alighted
at
the
station
next
above
the
one
by
which
he
had
made
his
escape
looking
down
the
street
it
was
too
dark
to
see
much
of
anything
but
a
confused
noise
as
of
a
gathering
crowd
reached
him
from
what
was
about
the
location
of
the
secondhand
store
he
listened
appreciatively
for
a
moment
is
it
a
perfectly
lovely
night
said
jimmie
dale
amiably
to
himself
and
to
think
of
that
cop
running
away
with
the
idea
that
i
did
see
him
when
he
hid
in
a
doorway
after
i
passed
the
corner
well
well
strange
is
it
with
another
glance
down
the
street
a
whimsical
lift
of
his
shoulders
he
headed
west
into
the
dilapidated
tenement
quarter
that
huddled
for
a
handful
of
blocks
near
by
just
south
of
washington
square
it
was
a
little
after
one
in
the
morning
now
and
the
pedestrians
were
casual
jimmie
dale
read
the
street
signs
on
the
corners
as
he
went
along
turned
abruptly
into
an
intersecting
street
counted
the
tenements
from
the
corner
as
he
passed
and
for
the
eye
of
any
one
who
might
be
watching
opened
the
street
door
of
one
of
them
quite
as
though
he
were
accustomed
and
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
so
and
went
inside
it
was
murky
and
dark
within
hot
unhealthy
with
lingering
smells
of
garlic
and
stale
cooking
he
groped
for
the
stairs
and
started
up
he
climbed
one
flight
then
another
and
one
more
to
the
top
here
treading
softly
he
made
an
examination
of
the
landing
with
a
view
evidently
to
obtaining
an
idea
of
the
location
and
the
number
of
doors
that
opened
off
from
it
his
selection
fell
on
the
third
door
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
there
were
four
all
told
two
apartments
of
two
rooms
each
he
paused
for
an
instant
to
adjust
the
black
silk
mask
tried
the
door
quietly
found
it
unlocked
opened
it
with
a
sudden
quick
brisk
movement
and
stepping
in
side
leaned
with
his
back
against
it
said
jimmie
dale
pleasantly
it
was
a
squalid
place
a
miserable
hole
in
which
a
single
flickering
yellow
gas
jet
gave
light
it
was
almost
bare
of
furniture
there
was
nothing
but
a
couple
of
cheap
chairs
a
rickety
table
unpawnable
a
boy
he
was
hardly
more
than
that
perhaps
from
a
posture
in
which
he
was
huddled
across
the
table
with
head
buried
in
arms
sprang
with
a
startled
cry
to
his
feet
said
jimmie
dale
again
your
name
hagan
bert
hagan
is
it
and
you
work
for
isaac
brolsky
in
the
secondhand
shop
over
on
west
broadway
do
you
the
boy
lips
quivered
and
the
gaunt
hollow
face
white
now
was
pitiful
i
i
guess
you
got
me
he
faltered
i
i
suppose
you
a
man
though
i
never
knew
dicks
wore
they
do
generally
said
jimmie
dale
coolly
it
a
fad
of
mine
bert
the
lad
hanging
to
the
table
turned
his
head
away
for
a
moment
and
there
was
silence
presently
hagan
spoke
again
i
go
he
said
numbly
i
wo
make
any
trouble
would
would
you
mind
not
speaking
loud
i
i
would
like
her
to
her
said
jimmie
dale
softly
the
boy
tiptoed
across
the
room
opened
a
connecting
door
a
little
peered
inside
opened
it
a
little
wider
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
jimmie
dale
jimmie
dale
crossed
to
the
boy
looked
inside
the
other
room
and
his
lip
twitched
queerly
as
the
sight
sent
a
quick
hurt
throb
through
his
heart
a
young
woman
younger
than
the
boy
lay
on
a
bed
a
rag
of
clothing
over
her
her
face
with
a
deathlike
pallor
upon
it
as
she
lay
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
stupor
she
was
ill
critically
ill
it
needed
no
trained
eye
to
discern
a
fact
all
too
apparent
to
the
most
casual
observer
the
squalor
the
glaring
poverty
here
was
even
more
pitifully
in
evidence
than
in
the
other
room
only
here
upon
a
chair
beside
the
bed
was
a
cluster
of
medicine
bottles
and
a
little
heap
of
fruit
jimmie
dale
drew
back
silently
as
the
boy
closed
the
door
hagan
walked
to
the
table
and
picked
up
his
hat
i
i
ready
he
said
brokenly
let
just
a
minute
said
jimmie
dale
tell
us
about
two
take
long
said
hagan
trying
to
smile
she
my
wife
the
sickness
took
all
we
had
i
i
kinder
got
behind
in
the
rent
and
things
they
were
going
to
fire
us
out
of
here
and
there
was
any
money
for
the
medicine
and
and
the
things
she
had
to
have
maybe
you
would
have
done
it
but
i
did
i
could
see
her
dying
there
for
the
want
of
something
a
little
money
buy
and
and
i
could
he
caught
his
voice
in
a
little
sob
i
could
see
her
thrown
out
on
the
street
like
and
so
said
jimmie
dale
instead
of
putting
old
isaac
cash
in
the
safe
this
evening
when
you
locked
up
you
put
it
in
your
pocket
instead
eh
did
you
know
you
get
caught
what
did
it
matter
said
the
boy
he
was
twirling
his
misshappen
hat
between
his
fingers
i
knew
they
know
it
was
me
in
the
morning
when
old
isaac
found
it
gone
because
there
was
anybody
else
to
do
it
but
i
paid
the
rent
for
four
months
ahead
and
i
fixed
it
she
have
medicine
and
things
to
eat
i
was
going
to
beat
it
before
daylight
myself
i
he
brushed
his
hand
hurriedly
across
his
cheek
i
did
want
to
go
to
leave
her
till
i
had
well
say
there
was
wonderment
in
jimmie
dale
tones
and
his
english
lapsed
into
ungrammatical
reassuring
vernacular
ai
that
queer
say
i
no
detective
gee
kid
did
you
think
i
was
say
listen
to
this
i
cracked
old
isaac
safe
half
an
hour
ago
and
i
guess
there
wo
be
any
idea
going
around
that
you
got
the
money
and
i
pulled
a
lemon
say
i
ai
superstitious
but
it
looks
like
luck
meant
you
to
have
another
chance
do
it
the
hat
dropped
from
hagan
hands
to
the
floor
and
he
swayed
a
little
you
you
ai
a
dick
he
stammered
then
how
you
know
about
me
and
my
name
when
you
found
the
safe
empty
who
told
you
a
wry
grimace
spread
suddenly
over
jimmie
dale
face
beneath
the
mask
and
he
swallowed
hard
jimmie
dale
would
have
given
a
good
deal
to
have
been
able
to
answer
that
question
himself
oh
that
said
jimmie
dale
that
easy
i
knew
you
worked
there
say
it
the
limit
ai
it
talk
about
your
luck
being
in
why
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
sit
tight
and
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
safe
as
a
church
only
say
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
the
money
now
you
got
a
four
months
start
and
are
kind
of
landed
on
your
feet
do
said
the
boy
i
pay
it
back
little
by
little
i
meant
to
i
ai
no
he
stopped
abruptly
crook
supplied
jimmie
dale
pleasantly
spit
it
right
out
kid
you
wo
hurt
my
feelings
none
well
i
tell
you
you
talking
the
way
i
like
to
hear
you
you
pay
that
back
slide
it
in
without
his
knowing
it
a
bit
at
a
time
whenever
you
can
and
you
never
hear
a
yip
out
of
me
but
if
you
do
why
it
kind
of
looks
as
though
i
have
a
right
to
come
down
your
street
and
get
my
share
or
know
the
reason
why
eh
then
you
never
get
any
share
said
hagan
with
a
catch
in
his
voice
i
pay
it
back
as
fast
as
i
sure
said
jimmie
dale
that
right
that
what
i
said
well
so
long
and
jimmie
dale
had
opened
the
door
and
slipped
outside
an
hour
later
in
his
dressing
room
in
his
house
on
riverside
drive
jimmie
dale
was
removing
his
coat
as
the
telephone
a
hand
instrument
on
the
table
rang
jimmie
dale
glanced
at
it
and
leisurely
proceeded
to
remove
his
vest
again
the
telephone
rang
jimmie
dale
took
off
his
curious
pocketed
leather
belt
as
the
telephone
repeated
its
summons
he
picked
out
the
little
drill
he
had
used
a
short
while
before
and
inspected
it
critically
feeling
its
point
with
his
thumb
as
one
might
feel
a
razor
blade
again
the
telephone
rang
insistently
he
reached
languidly
for
the
receiver
took
it
off
its
hook
and
held
it
to
his
ear
hello
said
jimmie
dale
with
a
sleepy
yawn
hello
hello
why
the
deuce
do
you
yank
a
man
out
of
bed
at
two
in
the
morning
and
have
done
with
it
and
eh
oh
that
you
carruthers
yes
came
carruthers
voice
excitedly
jimmie
listen
listen
the
gray
seal
come
to
life
he
just
pulled
a
break
on
west
broadway
good
lord
gasped
jimmie
dale
you
do
say
chapter
ii
by
proxy
the
most
puzzling
bewildering
delightful
crook
in
the
annals
of
crime
herman
carruthers
the
editor
of
the
morning
had
called
the
gray
seal
and
jimmie
dale
smiled
a
little
grimly
now
as
he
recalled
the
occasion
of
a
week
ago
at
the
james
club
over
their
coffee
that
was
before
his
second
debut
with
isaac
premises
over
on
west
broadway
as
a
setting
for
the
break
she
had
written
things
are
a
little
too
warm
are
they
jimmie
let
let
them
cool
for
a
well
they
had
cooled
for
a
year
and
carruthers
as
a
result
had
been
complacently
satisfied
in
his
own
mind
that
the
gray
seal
was
dead
until
that
break
at
isaac
brolsky
over
on
west
broadway
jimmie
dale
smile
was
tinged
with
whimsicality
now
the
only
effect
of
the
year
inaction
had
been
to
usher
in
his
renewed
activity
with
a
furor
compared
to
which
all
that
had
gone
before
was
insignificant
where
the
newspapers
had
been
maudlin
they
now
raved
raved
in
editorials
and
raved
in
headlines
it
was
an
impossible
untenable
unbelievable
condition
of
affairs
that
this
gray
seal
for
all
his
incomparable
cleverness
should
flaunt
his
crimes
in
the
faces
of
the
citizens
of
new
york
one
could
actually
see
the
editors
writhing
in
their
swivel
chairs
as
their
fiery
denunciations
dripped
from
their
pens
what
was
the
matter
with
the
police
were
the
police
children
or
worse
still
imbeciles
or
still
worse
again
was
there
some
one
higher
up
who
was
profiting
by
this
rogue
work
new
york
would
not
stand
for
it
new
york
would
most
decidedly
not
and
the
sooner
the
police
realised
that
fact
the
better
if
the
police
were
helpless
or
tools
the
citizens
of
new
york
were
not
and
it
was
time
the
citizens
were
thoroughly
aroused
there
was
a
way
too
to
arouse
the
citizens
that
was
both
good
business
from
the
newspaper
standpoint
and
efficacious
as
a
method
carruthers
of
the
morning
had
initiated
it
the
morning
offered
thousand
dollars
reward
for
the
capture
of
the
gray
seal
other
papers
immediately
followed
suit
in
varying
amounts
the
authorities
state
and
municipal
goaded
to
desperation
did
likewise
and
the
five
million
men
women
and
children
of
new
york
were
automatically
metamorphosed
into
embryonic
sleuths
new
york
was
aroused
jimmie
dale
alias
the
gray
seal
member
of
the
james
club
the
latter
fact
sufficient
in
itself
to
guarantee
his
social
standing
graduate
of
harvard
inheritor
of
his
deceased
immense
wealth
amassed
in
the
manufacture
of
safes
some
of
the
most
ingenious
patents
on
which
were
due
to
jimmie
dale
himself
figured
with
a
pencil
on
the
margin
of
the
newspaper
he
had
been
reading
using
the
arm
of
the
big
luxurious
lounging
chair
as
a
support
for
the
paper
the
result
of
his
calculations
was
thousand
dollars
he
brushed
the
paper
onto
the
turkish
rug
dove
into
the
pocket
of
his
dinner
jacket
for
his
cigarettes
and
began
to
smoke
as
his
eyes
strayed
around
the
room
his
own
particular
den
in
his
fashionable
riverside
drive
residence
thousand
dollars
reward
jimmie
dale
blew
meditative
rings
of
cigarette
smoke
at
the
fireplace
what
would
she
say
to
that
would
she
decide
it
was
too
hot
again
and
call
it
off
it
added
quite
a
little
hazard
to
the
game
quite
a
little
if
he
only
knew
who
she
was
it
was
a
strange
partnership
the
strangest
partnership
that
had
ever
existed
between
two
human
beings
he
turned
a
little
in
his
chair
as
a
step
sounded
in
the
hallway
without
that
is
jimmie
dale
caught
the
sound
muffled
though
it
was
by
the
heavy
carpet
came
then
a
knock
upon
the
door
come
in
invited
jimmie
dale
it
was
old
jason
the
butler
the
old
man
was
visibly
excited
as
he
extended
a
silver
tray
on
which
lay
a
letter
jimmie
dale
hand
reached
quickly
out
the
long
slim
tapering
fingers
closed
upon
the
envelope
but
his
eyes
were
on
jason
significantly
questioningly
yes
master
jim
said
the
old
man
i
recognised
it
on
the
instant
sir
after
what
you
said
sir
last
week
honouring
me
i
might
say
to
a
certain
extent
with
your
confidence
though
i
sure
i
do
know
what
it
all
means
i
who
brought
it
this
time
jason
inquired
jimmie
dale
quietly
not
the
young
person
begging
your
pardon
not
the
young
lady
sir
a
shuffer
in
a
big
automobile
master
at
once
he
says
and
shoves
the
letter
into
my
hand
and
was
very
good
jason
said
jimmie
dale
you
may
the
door
closed
yes
it
was
from
her
it
was
the
same
texture
of
paper
there
was
the
same
rare
haunting
fragrance
clinging
to
it
he
tore
the
envelope
open
and
extracted
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
what
was
it
this
time
to
call
the
partnership
off
again
until
the
present
furor
should
have
subsided
once
more
or
the
skilfully
sketched
outline
of
a
new
adventure
which
he
glanced
at
the
few
lines
written
on
the
sheet
and
lunged
forward
from
his
chair
to
his
feet
it
was
neither
one
nor
the
other
it
was
jimmie
dale
face
was
set
and
an
angry
red
surge
swept
his
cheeks
his
lips
moved
muttering
audibly
fragments
of
the
letter
as
he
stared
at
it
incredible
that
you
a
heinous
thing
act
instantly
this
is
ruin
for
an
instant
a
rare
occurrence
in
jimmie
dale
life
he
stood
like
a
man
stricken
still
staring
at
the
sheet
in
his
hand
then
mechanically
his
fingers
tore
the
paper
into
little
pieces
and
the
little
pieces
into
tiny
shreds
anger
fled
and
a
sickening
sense
of
impotent
dismay
took
its
place
the
red
left
his
cheeks
and
in
its
stead
a
grayness
came
act
instantly
the
words
seemed
to
leap
at
him
drum
at
his
ears
with
constant
repetition
act
instantly
but
how
how
then
his
brain
that
keen
clear
master
brain
sprang
from
stunned
inaction
into
virility
again
of
course
carruthers
it
was
in
carruthers
line
he
stepped
to
the
desk
and
paused
with
his
hand
extended
to
pick
up
the
telephone
how
explain
to
carruthers
that
he
jimmie
dale
already
knew
what
carruthers
might
not
yet
have
heard
of
even
though
carruthers
would
naturally
be
among
the
first
to
be
in
touch
with
such
affairs
no
that
would
never
do
better
get
there
himself
at
once
and
trust
to
the
telephone
rang
jimmie
dale
waited
until
it
rang
again
then
he
lifted
the
receiver
from
the
hook
hello
he
said
hello
hello
jimmie
came
a
voice
this
is
carruthers
that
you
jimmie
yes
said
jimmie
dale
and
sat
down
limply
in
the
desk
chair
it
the
gray
seal
again
i
promised
you
i
let
you
in
on
the
ground
floor
next
time
anything
happened
so
come
on
down
here
quick
if
you
want
to
see
some
of
his
work
at
jimmie
dale
flirted
a
bead
of
sweat
from
his
forehead
carruthers
said
jimmie
languidly
you
newspaper
chaps
make
me
tired
with
your
gray
seal
i
just
going
to
bed
nothing
spluttered
carruthers
from
the
other
end
of
the
wire
come
down
i
tell
you
it
worth
your
while
half
the
population
of
new
york
would
give
the
toes
off
their
feet
for
the
chance
come
down
you
blast
idiot
the
gray
seal
has
gone
the
limit
this
time
jimmie
dale
face
was
haggard
oh
he
said
peevishly
sounds
interesting
where
are
you
i
guess
maybe
i
jog
i
should
think
you
would
snapped
carruthers
you
know
the
palace
on
the
bowery
yes
well
meet
me
on
the
corner
there
as
soon
as
you
can
hustle
good
oh
i
say
carruthers
interposed
jimmie
dale
yes
demanded
carruthers
thanks
awfully
for
letting
me
know
old
do
mention
it
returned
carruthers
sarcastically
you
always
were
a
grateful
beast
jimmie
hurry
up
jimmie
dale
hung
up
the
receiver
of
the
city
and
took
down
the
receiver
of
another
a
installation
and
rang
twice
for
the
garage
the
light
car
at
once
benson
he
ordered
curtly
at
once
jimmie
dale
worked
quickly
then
in
his
dressing
room
he
changed
from
dinner
clothes
to
tweeds
spent
a
second
or
so
over
the
contents
of
a
locked
drawer
in
the
dresser
from
which
he
selected
a
very
small
but
serviceable
automatic
and
a
very
small
but
highly
powerful
magnifying
glass
whose
combination
of
little
round
lenses
worked
on
a
pivot
and
closed
over
one
another
were
of
about
the
compass
of
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
in
three
minutes
he
was
outside
the
house
and
stepping
into
the
car
just
as
it
drew
up
at
the
curb
benson
he
said
tersely
to
his
chauffeur
drop
me
one
block
this
side
of
the
palace
on
the
bowery
and
forget
there
was
ever
a
speed
law
enacted
understand
very
good
sir
said
benson
touching
his
cap
i
do
my
best
jimmie
dale
in
the
tonneau
stretched
out
his
legs
under
the
front
seat
and
dug
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
inside
the
pockets
his
hands
were
clenched
and
knotted
fists
murder
at
times
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
some
crook
of
the
underworld
would
attempt
to
cover
his
tracks
and
take
refuge
from
pursuit
by
foisting
himself
on
the
authorities
as
the
gray
seal
that
was
a
possibility
a
risk
always
to
be
run
but
that
murder
should
be
laid
to
the
gray
seal
door
anger
merciless
and
unrestrained
surged
over
jimmie
dale
there
was
peril
here
live
and
imminent
suppose
that
some
day
he
should
be
caught
in
some
little
affair
recognised
and
identified
as
the
gray
seal
there
would
be
the
charge
of
murder
hanging
over
him
and
the
electric
chair
to
face
but
the
peril
was
not
the
only
thing
even
worse
to
jimmie
artistic
and
sensitive
temperament
was
the
vilification
the
holding
up
to
loathing
contumely
and
abhorrence
of
the
name
the
stainless
name
of
the
gray
seal
it
was
stainless
he
had
guarded
it
jealously
as
a
man
guards
the
woman
name
he
loves
affairs
that
had
mystified
and
driven
the
police
distracted
with
impotence
there
had
been
many
of
them
and
on
the
face
of
them
crimes
but
no
act
ever
committed
had
been
in
reality
a
crime
none
without
the
highest
of
motives
the
righting
of
some
outrageous
wrong
the
protection
of
some
poor
stumbling
fellow
human
that
had
been
his
partnership
with
her
how
by
what
amazing
means
by
what
power
that
smacked
almost
of
the
miraculous
she
came
in
touch
with
all
these
things
and
supplied
him
with
the
data
on
which
to
work
he
did
not
know
only
that
thanks
to
her
there
were
happier
hearts
and
happier
homes
since
the
gray
seal
had
begun
to
work
dear
philanthropic
crook
she
often
called
him
in
her
letters
and
now
it
was
murder
take
carruthers
for
instance
for
years
as
a
reporter
before
he
had
risen
to
the
editorial
desk
he
had
been
one
of
the
keenest
on
the
scent
of
the
gray
seal
but
always
for
the
sake
of
the
game
always
filled
with
admiration
as
he
said
himself
for
the
daring
the
originality
of
the
most
puzzling
bewildering
delightful
crook
in
the
annals
of
crime
carruthers
was
but
an
example
carruthers
now
would
hunt
the
gray
seal
like
a
mad
dog
the
gray
seal
to
carruthers
and
every
one
else
would
be
the
vilest
name
in
the
land
a
synonym
for
murder
on
the
car
flew
and
upon
jimmie
dale
face
as
though
chiselled
in
marble
was
a
look
that
was
not
good
to
see
and
a
mirthless
smile
set
frozen
on
his
lips
i
get
the
man
that
did
this
gritted
jimmie
dale
between
his
teeth
i
get
him
and
when
i
get
him
i
wring
a
confession
from
him
if
i
have
to
swing
for
it
the
car
swept
from
broadway
into
astor
place
on
down
the
bowery
and
presently
stopped
jimmie
dale
stepped
out
i
shall
not
want
you
any
more
benson
he
said
you
may
return
jimmie
dale
started
down
the
block
a
nonchalant
jimmie
dale
now
if
anything
bored
a
little
near
the
corner
a
figure
back
turned
was
lounging
at
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
jimmie
dale
touched
the
man
on
the
arm
hello
carruthers
he
drawled
ah
jimmie
carruthers
turned
with
an
excited
smile
that
the
boy
you
made
mighty
quick
well
you
told
me
to
hurry
grumbled
jimmie
dale
i
doing
my
best
to
please
you
came
down
in
my
car
and
got
summoned
for
three
fines
carruthers
laughed
come
on
he
said
and
linking
his
arm
in
jimmie
dale
turned
the
corner
and
headed
west
along
the
cross
street
this
is
going
to
make
a
noise
he
continued
a
grim
note
creeping
into
his
voice
the
biggest
noise
the
city
has
ever
heard
i
take
back
all
i
said
about
the
gray
seal
i
always
pictured
his
cleverness
as
being
inseparable
with
at
least
a
decent
sort
of
man
even
if
he
was
a
rogue
and
a
criminal
but
i
through
with
that
he
a
rotter
and
a
hound
of
the
rankest
sort
i
did
think
there
was
anything
more
vulgar
or
brutal
than
murder
but
he
shown
me
that
there
is
a
guttersnipe
got
more
decency
to
murder
a
man
and
then
boastfully
label
the
corpse
is
say
carruthers
said
jimmie
dale
plaintively
suddenly
hanging
back
i
say
you
know
it
it
all
right
for
you
to
mess
up
in
this
sort
of
thing
it
your
beastly
business
and
i
awfully
damned
thankful
to
you
for
giving
me
a
but
is
it
er
rather
infra
dig
for
me
a
bit
morbid
you
know
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
never
hear
the
end
of
it
at
the
club
you
know
what
the
james
is
could
i
be
merideth
stanley
annstruther
or
something
like
that
one
of
your
new
reporters
or
something
like
that

carruthers
chuckled

jimmie
he
said

latest
addition
to
the
staff

the
do

incomparable
jimmie

jimmie
gratefully

have
to
have
a
notebook
or
something
do
i
carruthers
from
his
pocket
handed
him
one
thanks
said
jimmie
dale
a
little
way
ahead
a
crowd
had
collected
on
the
sidewalk
before
a
doorway
and
carruthers
pointed
with
a
jerk
of
his
hand
it
in
moriarty
place
a
gambling
hell
he
explained
i
got
the
story
myself
yet
though
i
been
inside
and
had
a
look
around
inspector
clayton
discovered
the
crime
and
reported
it
at
headquarters
i
was
at
my
desk
in
the
office
when
the
news
came
and
as
you
know
the
interest
i
taken
in
the
gray
seal
i
decided
to
it
myself
when
i
got
here
clayton
had
returned
from
headquarters
so
as
you
seemed
so
keenly
interested
last
week
i
telephoned
you
if

get
the
details
clayton
a
good
fellow
with
the
and
he
wo
hold
anything
out
on
us
now
here
we
are
keep
close
to
me
and
i
pass
you
they
shouldered
through
the
crowd
and
up
to
an
officer
at
the
door
the
officer
nodded
stepped
aside
and
carruthers
with
jimmie
dale
following
entered
the
house
they
climbed
one
flight
and
then
another
the
the
faro
stud
and
roulette
layouts
were
deserted
save
for
policemen
here
and
there
on
guard
carruthers
led
the
way
to
a
room
at
the
back
of
the
hall
whose
door
was
open
and
from
which
issued
a
hubbub
of
voices
one
voice
rose
above
the
others
heavy
and
gratingly
complacent
clayton
back
observed
carruthers
they
stepped
over
the
threshold
and
the
heavy
voice
greeted
them
ah
here
carruthers
now
you
carruthers
they
told
me
been
here
and
were
coming
back
so
i
been
keeping
the
boys
waiting
before
handing
out
the
dope
you
had
a
look
at
that
eh
he
flung
out
a
fat
hand
toward
the
bed
the
voices
rose
again
all
directed
at
carruthers
now
bubble
burst
eh
carruthers
what
about
the
of
crooks
artistry
in
crime
was
it
you
said
they
were
quoting
from
his
editorials
of
bygone
days
a
half
dozen
reporters
of
rival
papers
grinning
and
joshing
him
seemingly
quite
unaffected
by
what
lay
within
arm
reach
of
them
upon
the
bed
carruthers
smiled
a
little
wryly
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
presented
jimmie
dale
to
inspector
clayton
mr
matthewson
a
new
man
of
ours
glad
to
know
you
matthewson
said
the
inspector
jimmie
dale
found
his
hand
grasped
by
another
that
was
flabby
and
unpleasantly
moist
and
found
himself
looking
into
a
face
that
was
red
with
heavy
rolls
of
unhealthy
fat
terminating
in
a
double
chin
and
a
thick
apoplectic
neck
a
huge
round
face
with
rat
eyes
clayton
dropped
jimmie
dale
hand
and
waved
his
own
in
the
air
jimmie
dale
remained
modestly
on
the
outside
of
the
circle
as
the
reporters
gathered
around
the
police
inspector
now
then
said
clayton
coarsely
the
guy
that
croaked
there
is
metzer
jake
metzer
get
that
jimmie
dale
scribbling
hurriedly
in
his
notebook
like
all
the
rest
turned
a
little
toward
the
bed
and
his
lower
jaw
crept
out
the
fraction
of
an
inch
both
gas
jets
in
the
room
were
turned
on
full
giving
ample
light
a
man
fully
dressed
a
man
of
perhaps
forty
lay
upon
his
back
on
the
bed
one
arm
outflung
across
the
bedspread
the
other
dangling
with
fingers
just
touching
the
floor
the
head
at
an
angle
and
off
the
pillow
it
was
as
though
he
had
been
carried
to
the
bed
and
flung
upon
it
after
the
deed
had
been
committed
jimmie
dale
eyes
shifted
and
swept
the
room
yes
everything
was
in
disorder
as
though
there
had
been
a
struggle
a
chair
upturned
a
table
canted
against
the
wall
broken
pieces
of
crockery
from
the
washstand
on
the
carpet
and

of
crooks

still
scribbling
as
clayton
talked
stepped
to
the
bed
and
leaned
over
the
murdered
man
the
murder

been
done
with
a
blackjack
evidently
a
couple
of
blows
the
left
side
of
the
temple

crushed
in
right
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
pasted
there
a
diamond
shaped
paper
seal
flaunted
itself
the
device
of
the
gray
seal
in

hidden
as
he
turned
his
back
the
tiny
combination
of
powerful
lenses
was
focused
on
the
seal
clayton
guffawed
that
right
he
called
out

a
good
look
that
a
bright
young
man
you
got
jimmie
dale
looked
up
a
little
sheepishly
and
got
a
grin
from
the
assembled
reporters
and
a
scowl
from
carruthers
now
then
continued
clayton
here
the
facts
as
much
of
as
i
can
let
you
boys
print
at
present
you

stretching
a
point

and
metzer
there
was
getting
ready
to
close
down
on
a
big
piece
of
game
and
i
was
over
here
in
this
room
talking
to
him
about
it
early
this
afternoon
we
had
it
framed
to
get
our
man
see
i
left
metzer
say
about
three
and
he
was
to
show
up
over
at
headquarters
with
another
little
bit
of
evidence
we
wanted
at
eight
jimmie
dale
was
listening
to
every
word
but
he
stooped
now
again
over
the
murdered
man
head
deliberately
though
he
felt
the
rat
eyes
upon
him
stooped
and
with
his
finger
nail
lifted
back
the
point
of
the
seal
where
it
bordered
a
faint
thread
of
blood
on
the
man
forehead
there
was
a
roar
from
the
inspector
and
he
burst
through
the
ring
of
reporters
and
grabbed
jimmie
dale
by
the
shoulder
here
you
what
in
hell
are
you
doing
he
spluttered
angrily
embarrassed
and
confused
jimmie
dale
drew
back
glanced
around
and
smiled
again
a
little
sheepishly
as
his
eyes
rested
on
the
jowl
of
the
inspector
i
i
wanted
to
see
how
it
was
stuck
on
he
explained
inanely
stuck
on

clayton

it
stuck
on

better

where
were

dragged
up
anyway
the
coroner

here

you
a
hot
cub
of
a
reporter

turned
to
carruthers
to
get
out
printed
instructions
for
before
you
turn
loose
he
snapped
carruthers
face
was
red
with
mortification
there
was
a
grin
expanded
on
the
faces
of
the
others
stand
away
from
that
bed
roared
clayton
at
jimmie
dale
and
if
you
go
near
it
again
i
throw
you
out
of
here
bodily
jimmie
dale
edged
away
and
eyes
lowered
fumbled
nervously
with
the
leaves
of
his
notebook
clayton
grunted
glared
at
jimmie
dale
for
an
instant
viciously
and
resumed
his
story
i
was
saying
he
said
that
metzer
was
to
come
to
headquarters
at
eight
this
evening
well
he
did
show
up
that
looked
queer
it
was
mighty
important
business
we
was
after
one
of
the
biggest
hauls
we
ever
pulled
off
i
waited
till
nine
an
hour
ago
and
i
was
getting
nervous
then
i
started
over
here
to
find
out
what
was
the
matter
when
i
got
here
i
asked
moriarty
if
he
seen
metzer
moriarty
said
he
had
since
i
was
here
before
he
was
a
little
suspicious
that
i
had
something
on
metzer
see
well
by
pumping
moriarty
he
admitted
that
metzer
had
had
a
visitor
about
an
hour
after
i
who
was
it
know
what
his
name
is
inspector
asked
one
of
the
reporters
quickly
inspector
clayton
winked
heavily
do
be
greedy
boys
he
grinned
you
mean
you
got
him
burst
out
another
one
of
the
men
excitedly
sure
sure
i
got
inspector
clayton
waved
his
fat
hand
airily
or
i
will
have
before
morning
but
i
ai
saying
anything
more
till
it
he
smiled
significantly
well
that
about
all
got
the
details
right
around
you
i
left
moriarty
downstairs
and
came
up
here
and
found
just
what
you
see
metzer
laying
on
the
bed
there
and
the
gray
seal
stuck
on
his
forehead
and
he
ended
abruptly
i
have
the
gray
seal
himself
behind
the
bars
by
a
chorus
of
ejaculations
rose
from
the
reporters
while
their
pencils
worked
furiously
then
jimmie
dale
appeared
to
have
an
inspiration
jimmie
dale
turned
a
leaf
in
his
notebook
and
began
to
sketch
rapidly
cocking
his
head
now
on
one
side
now
on
the
other
with
a
few
deft
strokes
he
had
outlined
the
figure
of
inspector
clayton
the
reporter
beside
jimmie
dale
leaned
over
to
inspect
the
work
and
another
did
likewise
jimmie
dale
drew
in
clayton
face
most
excellently
if
somewhat
flatteringly
and
then
with
a
little
flourish
of
pride
wrote
under
the
drawing
the
man
who
captured
the
gray
that
a
cracking
good
sketch
pronounced
the
reporter
at
his
side
let
the
inspector
see
what
is
it
demanded
clayton
scowling
jimmie
dale
handed
him
the
notebook
modestly
inspector
clayton
took
it
looked
at
it
looked
at
jimmie
dale
then
his
scowl
relaxed
into
a
and
pleased
smile
and
he
grunted
approvingly
that
the
stuff
to
put
over
he
said
mabbe
you
not
much
of
a
reporter
but
you
can
draw
y
all
right
sport
y
all
right
forget
what
i
said
to
you
a
while
jimmie
dale
smiled
too
deprecatingly
and
put
the
notebook
in
his
pocket
an
officer
entered
the
room
hurriedly
and
drawing
clayton
aside
spoke
in
an
undertone
a
triumphant
and
malicious
grin
settled
on
features
and
he
started
with
a
rush
for
the
door
come
around
to
headquarters
in
two
hours
boys
he
called
as
he
went
out
and
i
have
something
more
for
the
room
cleared
the
reporters
tumbling
downstairs
to
make
for
the
nearest
telephones
to
get
their
copy
into
their
respective
offices
on
the
street
a
few
doors
up
from
the
house
where
they
were
free
from
the
crowd
carruthers
halted
jimmie
dale
jimmie
he
said
reproachfully
you
certainly
made
a
mark
of
us
both
there
was
any
need
to
play
the
so
egregiously
however
forgive
you
for
the
sake
of
the
sketch
hand
it
over
jimmie
i
going
to
reproduce
it
in
the
first
it
was
drawn
for
reproduction
carruthers
at
least
not
yet
said
jimmie
dale
quietly
carruthers
stared
at
him
eh
he
asked
blankly
i
taken
a
dislike
to
clayton
said
jimmie
dale
whimsically
too
patently
after
free
advertising
and
i
not
going
to
help
along
his
boost
you
ca
have
it
old
man
so
let
think
about
something
else
what
they
do
with
that
bit
of
paper
that
on
the
poor
forehead
up
there
for
say
said
carruthers
does
it
strike
you
that
you
acting
queer
you
have
been
drinking
have
you
jimmie
what
they
do
with
it
persisted
jimmie
dale
well
said
carruthers
smiling
a
little
tolerantly
photograph
it
and
enlarge
the
photograph
and
label
it
a
or
b
or
something
like
that
and
file
it
away
in
the
archives
with
the
fifty
or
more
just
like
it
that
are
already
in
their
that
what
i
thought
observed
jimmie
dale
he
took
carruthers
by
the
lapel
of
the
coat
i
like
a
photograph
of
that
i
like
it
so
much
that
i
got
to
have
it
know
the
chap
that
does
that
work
for
the
police
yes
admitted
carruthers
very
good
said
jimmie
dale
crisply
get
an
extra
print
of
the
enlargement
from
him
then
for
a
consideration
whatever
he
asks
pay
for
but
what
for
demanded
carruthers
i
do
because
said
jimmie
dale
very
seriously
put
it
down
to
imagination
or
whatever
you
like
i
think
i
smell
something
fishy
you
what
exclaimed
carruthers
in
amazement
you
not
joking
are
you
jimmie
jimmie
dale
laughed
shortly
it
so
far
from
a
joke
he
said
in
a
low
tone
that
i
want
your
word
you
get
that
photograph
into
my
hands
by
afternoon
no
matter
what
transpires
in
the
meantime
and
look
here
carruthers
do
think
i
playing
the
silly
thickhead
and
trying
to
mystify
you
i
no
detective
or
anything
like
that
just
got
an
idea
that
apparently
has
occurred
to
any
one
else
and
of
course
i
may
be
all
wrong
if
i
am
i
not
going
to
say
a
word
even
to
you
because
it
would
be
playing
fair
with
some
one
else
if
right
the
morning
gets
the
biggest
scoop
of
the
century
will
you
go
in
on
that
basis
carruthers
put
out
his
hand
impulsively
if
you
in
earnest
jimmie
you
bet
good
returned
jimmie
dale
the
photograph
by
afternoon
then
and
now
and
now
said
caruthers
i
got
to
hurry
over
to
the
office
and
get
a
man
at
work
will
you
come
along
or
meet
me
at
headquarters
later
clayton
said
in
two
hours
he
neither
said
jimmie
dale
i
not
interested
in
headquarters
going
well
all
right
then
carruthers
returned
you
can
bank
on
me
for
old
man
said
jimmie
dale
and
turning
walked
briskly
toward
the
bowery
but
jimmie
dale
did
not
go
home
he
walked
down
the
bowery
for
three
blocks
crossed
to
the
east
side
and
turned
down
a
cross
street
two
blocks
more
he
walked
in
this
direction
and
halfway
down
the
next
here
he
paused
an
instant
the
street
was
dimly
lighted
almost
dark
deserted
jimmie
dale
edged
close
to
the
houses
until
his
shadow
blended
with
the
shadows
of
the
walls
and
slipped
suddenly
into
a
areaway
he
opened
a
door
stepped
into
an
unlighted
hallway
where
the
air
was
close
and
evil
smelling
mounted
a
stairway
and
halted
before
another
door
on
the
first
landing
there
was
the
low
clicking
of
a
lock
three
times
repeated
and
he
entered
a
room
closing
and
fastening
the
door
behind
him
jimmie
dale
called
it
his
in
one
of
the
worst
neighbourhoods
of
new
york
where
no
questions
were
asked
as
long
as
the
rent
was
paid
it
had
the
further
advantage
of
three
separate
exits
one
by
the
areaway
where
he
had
entered
one
from
the
street
itself
and
another
through
a
back
yard
with
an
entry
into
a
saloon
that
fronted
on
the
next
street
it
was
not
often
that
jimmie
dale
used
his
sanctuary
but
there
had
been
times
when
it
was
no
more
nor
less
than
exactly
what
he
called
it
a
sanctuary
he
stepped
to
the
window
assured
himself
that
the
shade
was
down
and
lighted
the
gas
blinking
a
little
as
the
yellow
flame
illuminated
the
room
it
was
a
rough
place
dirty
uninviting
a
bedroom
furnished
in
the
most
scanty
fashion
neither
apparently
was
there
anything
suspicious
about
it
to
reward
one
curious
enough
to
break
in
during
the
absence
some
rather
disreputable
clothes
hanging
on
the
wall
and
flung
untidily
across
the
bed
that
was
all
alone
now
jimmie
dale
face
was
strained
and
anxious
and
occasionally
as
he
undressed
himself
his
hands
clenched
until
his
knuckles
grew
white
the
gray
seal
on
the
murdered
man
forehead
was
a
genuine
gray
seal
one
of
jimmie
dale
own
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
he
had
satisfied
himself
on
that
point
where
had
it
come
from
how
had
it
been
obtained
jimmie
dale
carefully
placed
the
clothes
he
had
taken
off
under
the
mattress
pulled
a
disreputable
collarless
flannel
shirt
over
his
head
and
pulled
on
a
disreputable
pair
of
boots
there
were
only
two
sources
of
supply
his
own
and
the
collection
that
the
police
had
made
which
carruthers
had
referred
to
jimmie
dale
lifted
a
corner
of
the
oilcloth
in
a
corner
of
the
room
lifted
a
piece
of
the
flooring
lifted
out
a
little
box
which
he
placed
upon
the
rickety
table
and
sat
down
before
a
cracked
mirror
who
was
it
that
would
have
access
to
the
gray
seals
in
the
possession
of
the
police
since
obviously
it
was
one
of
those
that
was
on
the
dead
forehead
the
answer
came
quick
enough
came
with
the
sudden
of
jimmie
dale
lower
jaw
one
of
the
police
themselves
no
one
else
clayton
heavy
cunning
face
clayton
shifty
eyes
clayton
sudden
rush
when
he
had
touched
the
dead
man
forehead
pictured
themselves
in
a
red
flash
of
fury
before
jimmie
dale
there
was
no
mask
now
no
facetiousness
no
acted
part
only
a
merciless
rage
and
the
muscles
of
jimmie
dale
face
quivered
and
twitched
murder
foisted
shifted
upon
another
upon
the
gray
seal
making
of
that
name
a
calumny
ruining
forever
the
work
that
she
and
he
might
do
and
then
jimmie
dale
smiled
mirthlessly
with
thinning
lips
the
box
before
him
was
open
his
fingers
worked
quickly
a
little
wax
behind
the
ears
in
the
nostrils
under
the
upper
lip
deftly
wrists
neck
throat
and
face
received
their
quota
of
stain
applied
with
an
artist
touch
and
then
the
spruce
muscular
jimmie
dale
transformed
into
a
slouching
denizen
of
the
underworld
replaced
the
box
under
the
flooring
pulled
a
slouch
hat
over
his
eyes
extinguished
the
gas
and
went
out
jimmie
dale
range
of
acquaintanceship
was
wide
from
the
upper
strata
of
the
james
club
to
the
elite
of
new
york
gangland
and
adored
by
the
one
he
was
trusted
implicitly
by
the
other
not
understood
perhaps
by
the
latter
for
he
had
never
allied
himself
with
any
of
their
nefarious
schemes
but
trusted
implicitly
through
long
years
of
personal
contact
it
had
stood
jimmie
dale
in
good
stead
before
this
association
where
in
a
sort
of
strange
carefully
guarded
exchange
the
news
of
the
underworld
was
common
property
to
those
without
the
law
to
new
york
in
its
millions
the
murder
of
metzer
the
stool
pigeon
would
be
unknown
until
the
city
rose
in
the
morning
to
read
the
sensational
details
over
the
breakfast
table
here
it
would
already
be
the
topic
of
whispered
conversations
here
it
had
probably
been
known
long
before
the
police
had
discovered
the
crime
especially
would
it
be
expected
to
be
known
to
pete
lazanis
commonly
called
the
runt
who
was
a
power
below
the
dead
line
and
more
pertinent
still
one
in
whose
confidence
jimmie
dale
had
rejoiced
for
years
jimmie
dale
as
larry
the
bat
a
euphonious
monaker
bestowed
possibly
because
this
particular
world
knew
him
only
by
night
began
a
search
for
the
runt
from
one
resort
to
another
he
hurried
talking
in
the
accepted
style
through
one
corner
of
his
mouth
to
individuals
behind
dirty
reeking
bars
that
were
reared
on
equally
dirty
and
floors
visiting
dance
halls
secretive
back
rooms
and
certain
chinese
pipe
joints
but
the
runt
was
decidedly
elusive
there
had
been
no
news
of
him
no
one
had
seen
him
and
this
after
fully
an
hour
had
passed
since
jimmie
dale
had
left
carruthers
in
front
of
moriarty
the
possibilities
however
were
still
legion
numbered
only
by
the
numberless
dives
and
dens
sheltered
by
that
quarter
of
the
city
jimmie
dale
turned
into
chatham
square
heading
for
the
pagoda
dance
hall
a
man
loitering
at
the
curb
shot
a
swift
searching
glance
at
him
as
he
slouched
by
jimmie
dale
paused
in
the
doorway
of
the
pagoda
and
looked
up
and
down
the
street
the
man
he
had
passed
had
drawn
a
little
closer
another
man
in
an
apparently
aimless
fashion
lounged
a
few
yards
away
something
up
muttered
jimmie
dale
to
himself
lansing
of
headquarters
and
the
other
looks
like
jimmie
dale
pushed
in
through
the
door
of
the
pagoda
a
bedlam
of
noise
surged
out
at
him
a
piano
and
a
mandolin
were
going
furiously
from
a
little
raised
platform
at
the
rear
in
the
centre
of
the

a
dozen
couples
were
in
the
throes
of
the
tango
and
the
around
the
sides
at
little
tables
men
and
women
laughed
and
applauded
and
thumped
time
on
the
tabletops
with
their
beer
mugs
while
waiters
with
aprons
and
unshaven
faces
juggled
marvelous
handfuls
of
glasses
and
mugs
from
the
bar
beside
the
platform
to
the
patrons
at
the
tables
jimmie
dale
eyes
swept
the
room
in
a
swift
comprehensive
glance
fixed
on
a
little
fellow
loudly
dressed
who
shared
a
table
halfway
down
the
room
with
a
woman
in
a
picture
hat
and
a
smile
of
relief
touched
his
lips
the
runt
at
last
he
walked
down
the
room
caught
the
runt
eyes
significantly
as
he
passed

table
kept
on
to
a
door
between
the
platform
and
the
bar
opened
it
and
went
out
into
a
lighted
hallway
at
one
end
of
which
a
door
opened
onto
the
street
and
at
the
other
a

eyelid
and
with

the

lip
sagged
down
in

opposite
corner
of

he
gasped
and
shrank
hastily
back
against
the
wall
beside
jimmie
dale
the
door
from
the
street
had
opened
noiselessly
instantly
black
forms
bulked
there
then
a
rush
of
feet
and
at
the
head
of
half
a
dozen
men
the
face
of
inspector
clayton
loomed
up
before
jimmie
dale
there
was
a
second
pause
in
the
rush
and
in
the
pause
clayton
voice
in
a
vicious
undertone
you
two
ginks
open

then
the
rush
passed
and
swept
on
up

stairs

dale
looked
at
the

limply

suddenly
queer

after
all
jimmie
dale
drew
closer
to
the

spoke
again
from

corner
of
his

almost
inaudibly
are
youse
sure
it
was
stace
croaked
metzer
wot
fer
how

the
runt
was
listening
his
eyes
strained
toward
the
stairs
the
hall
door
to
the
street
was
closed
but
both
were
quite
well
aware
that
there
was
an

on

whispered
the
runt
metzer

fixin
ter

on

when
he
had
de
chanst
instead
of

answered
we

gettin
de
coin
fer
him
ter
fade
away
wid
an
a
revolver
shot
from
above
cut
short
his
words
came
then
the
sound
of
a
struggle
oaths
the
shuffling
tread
of
feet
but
in
the
dance
hall
the
piano
still
rattled
on
the
mandolin
twanged
voices
sang
and
applauded
and
beer
mugs
thumped
time
they
were
on
the
stairs
now
the
officers
half
carrying
half
dragging
some
one
between
them
and
the
man
they
dragged
cursed
them
with
utter
abandon
as
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
jimmie
dale
caught
sight
of
the
prisoner
face
not
a
prepossessing
one
villainous
contorted
with
a
mixture
of
fear
and
rage
it
a
lie
a
lie
a
lie
the
man
shrieked
i
never
seen
him
in
me
life
blast
you
curse
you
d
hear
inspector
clayton
caught
jimmie
dale
and
the
runt
by
the
collars
there
nothing
to
interest
you
around
here
he
snapped
maliciously
go
on
now
beat
it
and
he
pushed
them
toward
the
door
they
had
heard
the
disturbance
in
the
dance
hall
now
and
the
occupants
were
swarming
to
the
sidewalk
a
patrol
wagon
came
around
the
corner
in
the
crowd
jimmie
dale
slipped
away
from
the
runt
was
he
wrong
after
all
a
fierce
passion
seized
him
it
was
stace
morse
who
had
murdered
metzer
the
runt
had
said
in
jimmie
dale
brain
the
words
began
to
reiterate
themselves
in
a
singsong
fashion
it
was
stace
morse
it
was
stace
then
his
lips
drew
tight
together
was
it
stace
morse
he
would
have
given
a
good
deal
for
a
chance
to
talk
to
the
man
even
for
a
minute
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
that
now
later
perhaps
if
he
was
wrong
after
all
jimmie
dale
returned
to
the
sanctuary
removed
from
his
person
all
evidences
of
larry
the
bat
and
from
the
sanctuary
went
home
to
riverside
drive
in
his
den
there
in
the
morning
after
breakfast
jason
the
butler
brought
him
the
papers
headlines
in
red
ink
screamed
exulted
and
shrieked
out
the
news
that
the
gray
seal
in
the
person
of
stace
morse
fence
yeggman
and
murderer
had
been
captured
the
public
if
it
had
held
any
private
admiration
for
the
mysterious
crook
could
now
once
and
forever
disillusion
itself
the
gray
seal
was
stace
morse
and
stace
morse
was
of
the
dregs
of
the
city
scum
a
pariah
an
outcast
with
no
single
redeeming
trait
to
lift
him
from
the
ruck
of
mire
and
slime
that
had
strewn
his
life
from
infancy
the
face
of
inspector
clayton
blandly
leaped
out
from
the
paper
to
meet
jimmie
dale
eyes
and
with
it
a
column
and
a
half
of
perfervid
eulogy
something
at
first
like
dismay
the
dismay
of
impotency
filled
jimmie
dale
and
then
cold
leaving
him
unnaturally
calm
the
old
merciless
rage
took
its
place
there
was
nothing
to
do
now
but
wait
wait
until
carruthers
should
send
that
photograph
then
if
after
all
he
were
wrong
then
he
must
find
some
other
way
but
was
he
wrong
the
notebook
that
carruthers
had
given
him
open
at
the
sketch
he
had
made
of
clayton
lay
upon
the
desk
jimmie
dale
picked
it
up
he
had
already
spent
quite
a
little
time
over
it
before
breakfast
and
examined
it
again
minutely
even
resorting
to
his
magnifying
glass
he
put
it
down
as
a
knock
sounded
at
the
door
and
jason
entered
with
a
silver
card
tray
from
carruthers
already
jimmie
dale
stepped
quickly
forward
and
then
jimmie
dale
met
the
old
man
eyes
it
was
from
carruthers
it
was
from
her
the
same
shuffer
brought
it
master
jim
said
jason
jimmie
dale
snatched
the
envelope
from
the
tray
and
waved
the
other
from
the
room
as
the
door
closed
he
tore
open
the
letter
there
was
just
a
single
line
jimmie
jimmie
you
have
failed
have
you
jimmie
dale
stared
at
it
failed
failed
her
the
haggard
look
was
in
his
face
again
it
was
the
bond
between
them
that
was
at
stake
the
gray
seal
the
bond
that
had
come
he
knew
for
all
time
in
that
instant
to
mean
his
life
god
knows
he
muttered
hoarsely
and
flung
himself
into
a
lounging
chair
still
staring
at
the
note
the
hours
dragged
by
luncheon
time
arrived
and
passed
and
then
by
special
messenger
the
little
package
from
carruthers
came
jimmie
dale
started
to
undo
the
string
then
laid
the
package
down
and
held
out
his
hands
before
him
for
inspection
they
were
trembling
visibly
it
was
a
strange
condition
for
jimmie
dale
either
to
witness
or
experience
unlike
him
foreign
to
him
this
wo
do
jimmie
he
said
grimly
shaking
his
head
he
picked
up
the
package
again
opened
it
and
from
between
two
pieces
of
cardboard
took
out
a
large
photographic
print
a
moment
two
jimmie
dale
examined
it
used
the
magnifying
glass
again
and
then
a
strange
gleam
came
into
the
dark
eyes
and
his
lips
moved
i
won
said
jimmie
dale
with
ominous
softness
i
won
he
was
standing
beside
the
rosewood
desk
and
he
reached
for
the
phone

be
at
home
now

called
carruthers
there
after
a
moment
or
two

said

jimmie
dale
hung
up
the
receiver
and
hastily
now
began
to
write
upon
a
pad
that
lay
before
him
on
the
desk
the
minutes
passed
as
he
wrote
he
scored
out
words
and
lines
here
and
there
substituting
others
at
the
end
he
had
covered
three
large
pages
with
to
any
one
but
himself
an
indecipherable
scrawl
these
he
shoved
aside
now
and
very
carefully
very
legibly
made
a
copy
on
fresh
sheets
as
he
finished
he
heard
a
car
draw
up
in
front
of
the
house
jimmie
dale
folded
the
copied
sheets
neatly
tucked
them
in
his
pocket
lighted
a
cigarette
and
was
lolling
lazily
in
his
chair
as
jason
announced
mr
carruthers
sir
and
another
gentleman
to
see
show
them
up
jason
instructed
jimmie
dale
jimmie
dale
rose
from
his
chair
as
they
came
in
jason
servant
closed
the
door
behind
them

said
jimmie
dale
pleasantly
and
waved
them
to
seats

this
chair
he
motioned
to
one
at
his
elbow
glad
to
see
you
inspector
try
that
one
in
front
of
the
desk
you
find
it
carruthers
trying
to
catch
jimmie
dale
eye
for
some
sort
of
a
cue
and
failing
sat
down
inspector
clayton
stared
at
jimmie
dale
oh
it
you
eh
his
eyes
roved
around
the
room
fastened
for
an
instant
on
some
of
jimmie
dale
work
on
an
easel
came
back
finally
to
jimmie
dale
and
he
plumped
himself
down
in
the
chair
indicated
thought
you
was
a
cub
reporter
he
remarked
with
a
grin
you
were
too
slick
with
your
pencil
pretty
fine
studio
you
got
here
carruthers
says
you
going
to
draw
jimmie
dale
smiled
not
pleasantly
and
leaned
suddenly
over
the
desk
yes
he
said
slowly
a
grim
intonation
in
his
voice
going
to
draw
you
true
to
with
an
exclamation
clayton
slued
around
in
his
chair
half
rose
and
his
shifty
eyes
small
and
cunning
bored
into
jimmie
dale
face
what
d
mean
by
that
he
snapped
out
just
exactly
what
i
say
replied
jimmie
dale
curtly
no
more
no
less
but
first
not
to
be
too
abrupt
i
want
to
join
with
the
newspapers
in
congratulating
you
on
the
remarkable
shall
i
call
it
celerity
or
acumen
with
which
you
solved
the
mystery
of
death
and
placed
the
murderer
behind
the
bars
it
is
really
remarkable
inspector
so
remarkable
in
fact
that
it
almost
suspicious
you
think
so
no
well
that
what
carruthers
was
good
enough
to
bring
you
up
here
to
talk
over
in
an
intimate
and
confidential
way
you
inspector
clayton
surged
up
from
his
chair
to
his
feet
his
fists
clenched
the
red
sweeping
over
his
face
and
then
he
shook
one
fist
at
carruthers
so
that
your
game
is
it
he
stormed
trying
to
crawl
out
of
that
thousand
reward
eh
and
as
for
you
he
turned
on
jimmie
dale
you
rigged
up
a
nice
little
plant
between
you
eh
well
it
wo
work
and
i
make
you
squirm
for
this
both
of
you
damn
you
before
i
through
he
glared
from
one
to
the
other
for
a
moment
then
swung
on
his
heel
gentlemen
he
sneered
as
he
started
for
the
door
he
was
halfway
across
the
room
before
jimmie
dale
spoke
clayton
clayton
turned
jimmie
dale
was
still
leaning
over
the
desk
but
now
one
elbow
was
propped
upon
it
and
in
the
most
casual
way
a
revolver
covered
inspector
clayton
if
you
attempt
to
leave
this
room
said
jimmie
dale
without
raising
his
voice
i
assure
you
that
i
shall
fire
with
as
little
compunction
as
though
i
were
aiming
at
a
mad
dog
and
i
apologise
to
all
mad
dogs
for
coupling
your
name
with
his
voice
rang
suddenly
cold
come
back
here
and
sit
down
in
that
chair
the
colour
ebbed
slowly
from
clayton
face
he
hesitated
then
sullenly
retraced
his
steps
hesitated
again
as
he
reached
the
chair
and
finally
sat
down
what
what
d
mean
by
this
he
stammered
trying
to
bluster
just
this
said
jimmie
dale
that
i
accuse
you
of
the
murder
of
jake
metzer
it
was
you
who
murdered
good
god
burst
suddenly
from
carruthers

yelled
clayton
and
again
he
surged
up
from
his
chair
that
is
what
stace
morse
said
said
jimmie
dale
coolly
sit
down
then
clayton
tried
to
laugh

his
voice
rose
shrilly
it
was
stace
you

a
despicable
hound
said
jimmie
dale
through
set
lips
here
he
handed
the
revolver
over
to
carruthers
keep
him
covered
carruthers
you
going
to
the
chair
for
this
clayton
he
said
in
a
fierce
monotone
the
chair

your
place

time

draw
you
now
true
to

years
on
every
disreputable
den
in
your
district
metzer
was
going
to
show
you
up
and
so
metzer
being
in
the
road
you
removed
him
and
you
seized
on
the
fact
of
stace
morse
having
paid
a
visit
to
him
this
afternoon
to
fix
the
crime
on
stace
morse
proofs

proofs
enough
to
convict
him
if
there
stronger
proofs
to
convict
convict
me
clayton
lower
jaw
hung
loosely
but
still
he
made
an
effort
at
bluster

have
a
thing
on
me
not
a
thing
not
a
jimmie
dale
smiled
again
unpleasantly
you
are
quite
wrong
clayton
see
he
took
a
sheet
of
paper
from
the
drawer
of
his
desk
clayton
reached
for
it
quickly
what
is
it
he
demanded
jimmie
dale
drew
it
back
out
of
reach
just
a
minute
he
said
softly
you
remember
do
you
that
in
the
presence
of
carruthers
here
of
myself
and
of
half
a
dozen
reporters
you
stated
that
you
had
been
alone
with
metzer
in
his
room
at
three
yesterday
and
that
it
was
you
alone
who
found
the
body
later
on
at
nine
yes

simply
to

that
from
your
own
lips
the
evidence
is
complete
that
you
had
an
opportunity
to
commit
the
crime
now
you
may
look
at
this
he
handed
over
the
sheet
of
paper
clayton
took
it
stared
at
it
turning
it
over
from
first
one
side
to
the
other
then
a
sort
of
relief
seemed
to
come
to
him
and
he
gulped
nothing
but
a
damned
piece
of
blank
paper
he
mumbled
jimmie
dale
reached
over
and
took
back
the
sheet
you
wrong
again
clayton
he
said
calmly
it
was
quite
blank
before
i
handed
it
to
you
but
not
now
i
noticed
yesterday
that
your
hands
were
generally
moist
i
am
sure
they
are
more
so
now
excitement
you
know
carruthers
see
that
he
does
from
a
drawer
jimmie
dale
took
out
a
little
black
bottle
the
notebook
he
had
used
the
day
before
and
the
photograph
carruthers
had
sent
him
on
the
sheet
of
paper
clayton
had
just
handled
jimmie
dale
sprinkled
a
little
powder
from
the
bottle
lampblack
explained
jimmie
dale
he
shook
the
paper
carefully
allowing
the
loose
powder
to
fall
on
the
desk
blotter
and
held
out
the
sheet
toward
clayton
rather
neat
is
it
a
very
good
impression
too
your
thumb
print
clayton
now
do
move
you
may
look
not
he
laid
the
paper
down
on
the
desk
in
front
of
clayton
beside
it
he
placed
the
notebook
open
at
the
sketch
a
black
thumb
print
now
upon
it
you
recall
handling
this
yesterday
i
sure
clayton
i
tried
the
same
experiment
with
the
lampblack
on
it
this
morning
you
see
and
this
beside
the
notebook
he
placed
the
police
photograph
that
too
in
its
enlargement
showed
sharply
defined
a
thumb
print
on
a
background
you
will
no
doubt
recognise
it
as
an
official
photograph
enlarged
taken
of
the
gray
seal
on
forehead
and
the
thumb
print
of
metzer
murderer
you
have
only
to
glance
at
the
little
scar
at
the
edge
of
the
centre
loop
to
satisfy
yourself
that
the
three
are
identical
of
course
there
are
a
dozen
other
points
of
similarity
equally
indisputable
but
jimmie
dale
stopped
clayton
was
on
his
feet
rocking
on
his
feet
his
face
was
deathlike
in
its
pallor
moisture
was
oozing
from
his
forehead
i
did
do
it
i
did
do
it
he
cried
out
wildly
my
god
i
tell
you
i
did
do
it
and
and
that
would
send
me
to
the
yes
said
jimmie
dale
coldly
and
that
precisely
where
going
to
the
the
man
was
beside
himself
now
racked
to
the
soul
by
a
paroxysm
of
fear
i
innocent
innocent
he
screamed
out
oh
for
god
sake
send
an
innocent
man
to
his
death
it
was
stace
morse
listen
listen
i
tell
the
he
was
clawing
with
his
hands
piteously
over
the
desk
at
jimmie
dale
when
the
big
rewards
came
out
last
week
i
stole
one
of
the
gray
seals
from
the
bunch
at
headquarters
to
to
use
it
the
first
time
any
crime
was
committed
when
i
was
sure
i
could
lay
my
hands
on
the
man
who
did
it
do
you
see
of
course
he
deny
he
was
the
gray
seal
just
as
he
deny
that
he
was
guilty
but
i
have
the
proof
both
ways
and
and
i
collect
the
rewards
and
and
the
man
collapsed
into
the
chair
carruthers
was
up
from
his
seat
his
hands
gripping
tight
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
as
he
leaned
over
it
jimmie
jimmie
what
does
this
mean
he
gasped
out
jimmie
dale
smiled
pleasantly
now
that
he
has
told
the
truth
said
jimmie
dale
quietly
it
is
quite
true
that
stace
morse
committed
the
murder
shows
up
the
value
of
circumstantial
evidence
though
does
it
this
would
certainly
have
got
him
off
and
convicted
clayton
here
before
any
jury
in
the
land
but
the
point
is
carruthers
that
stace
morse
is
the
gray
seal
and
that
the
gray
seal
is
not
a
clayton
looked
up
you
you
believe
me
he
stammered
eagerly
jimmie
dale
whirled
on
him
in
a
sudden
sweep
of
passion
no
you
cur
he
flashed
it
not
you
i
believe
i
simply
wanted
your
confession
before
he
whipped
the
three
written
sheets
from
his
pocket
here
substantially
is
that
confession
written
he
passed
it
to
carruthers
read
it
to
him
carruthers
read
it
aloud
now
said
jimmie
dale
grimly
this
spells
ruin
for
you
clayton
you
do
deserve
a
chance
to
escape
prison
bars
but
i
going
to
give
you
one
for
you
going
to
get
it
pretty
stiff
anyhow
if
you
refuse
to
sign
this
i
hand
you
over
to
the
district
attorney
in
half
an
hour
and
carruthers
and
i
will
swear
to
your
confession
on
the
other
hand
if
you
sign
it
carruthers
will
not
be
able
to
print
it
until
morning
and
that
gives
you
something
like
fourteen
hours
to
put
distance
between
yourself
and
new
york
here
is
a
pen
if
you
are
quick
enough
to
take
us
by
surprise
once
you
have
signed
you
might
succeed
in
making
a
dash
for
that
door
and
effecting
your
escape
without
forcing
us
to
compound
a
felony
understand
clayton
hand
trembled
violently
as
he
seized
the
pen
he
scrawled
his
name
looked
from
one
to
the
other
wet
his
lips
and
then
taking
jimmie
dale
at
his
word
rushed
for
the
door
and
the
door
slammed
behind
him
carruthers
face
was
hard
what
did
you
let
him
go
for
jimmie
he
said
uncompromisingly
selfishness
pure
selfishness
said
jimmie
dale
softly
they
guy
me
unmercifully
if
they
ever
heard
of
it
at
the
james
club
the
honour
is
all
yours
carruthers
i
do
appear
on
the
stage
understood
yes
well
then
he
handed
over
the
signed
confession
is
the
big
enough
carruthers
fingered
the
sheets
but
his
eyes
in
a
bewildered
way
searched
jimmie
dale
face
big
enough
he
echoed
as
though
invoking
the
universe
it
the
biggest
thing
the
newspaper
game
has
ever
known
but
how
did
you
come
to
do
it
what
started
you
where
did
you
get
your
lead
why
from
you
i
guess
carruthers
jimmie
dale
answered
thoughtfully
with
artfully
puckered
brow
i
remembered
that
you
had
said
last
week
that
the
gray
seal
never
left
finger
marks
on
his
work
and
i
saw
one
on
the
seal
on
metzer
forehead
then
you
know
i
lifted
one
corner
where
the
seal
overlapped
a
thread
of
blood
and
underneath
the
thread
of
blood
was
in
the
slightest
disturbed
so
of
course
i
knew
the
seal
had
been
put
on
quite
a
long
time
after
the
man
was
dead
not
until
the
blood
had
dried
thoroughly
to
a
crust
you
know
so
that
even
the
damp
surface
of
the
sticky
side
of
the
seal
had
affected
it
and
then
i
took
a
dislike
to
clayton
somehow
and
put
two
and
two
together
and
took
a
flyer
in
getting
him
to
handle
the
notebook
i
guess
all
no
other
reason
on
earth
jolly
lucky
do
you
think
carruthers
did
say
anything
for
a
moment
when
he
spoke
it
was
irrelevantly
you
saved
me
thousand
dollars
on
that
reward
that
the
only
thing
i
regret
said
jimmie
dale
brightly
it
nice
of
you
carruthers
to
turn
on
the
gray
seal
that
way
and
it
strikes
me
you
owe
the
chap
whoever
he
is
a
pretty
emphatic
exoneration
after
what
you
said
in
this
morning
jimmie
said
carruthers
earnestly
you
know
what
i
thought
of
him
before
it
like
a
new
lease
of
life
to
get
back
one
faith
in
him
you
leave
it
to
me
i
put
the
gray
seal
on
a
pedestal
that
will
be
worthy
of
the
immortals
you
leave
it
to
and
carruthers
kept
his
word
also
before
the
paper
had
been
an
hour
off
the
press
carruthers
received
a
letter
it
thanked
carruthers
quite
genuinely
even
if
couched
in
somewhat
facetious
terms
for
his
sweeping
vindication
twitted
him
gently
for
his
backsliding
begged
to
remain
his
gratefully
and
in
lieu
of
signature
there
was
a
piece
of
paper
shaped
like
this
picture
only
there
were
no
fingerprints
on
it
chapter
iii
the
mother
lode
it
was
the
following
evening
and
they
had
dined
together
again
at
the
james
club
jimmie
dale
and
carruthers
of
the
morning
from
clayton
and
a
discussion
of
the
metzer
murder
the
conversation
had
turned
not
illogically
upon
the
physiognomy
of
criminals
in
general
jimmie
dale
lazily
ensconced
now
in
a
lounging
chair
in
one
of
the
club
private
library
rooms
flicked
a
minute
speck
of
cigar
ash
from
the
sleeve
of
his
dinner
jacket
and
smiled
whimsically
across
the
table
at
his
friend
oh
i
dare
say
there
a
lot
in
physiognomy
carruthers
he
drawled
never
studied
the
thing
you
know
that
is
from
the
standpoint
of
crime
personally
i
only
got
one
prejudice
i
distrust
on
principle
the
man
who
wears
a
perennial
and
pompous
smirk
which
is
of
course
strictly
speaking
physiognomy
at
all
you
see
a
man
help
his
eyes
being
beady
or
his
nose
pronounced
but
pomposity
and
a
smirk
now
jimmie
dale
shrugged
his
shoulders
carruthers
laughed
and
then
glanced
ludicrously
at
jimmie
dale
as
the
door
ajar
was
pushed
open
and
a
man
entered
speaking
of
angels
murmured
jimmie
dale
and
sat
up
in
his
chair
hello
markel
he
observed
casually
you
met
carruthers
of
the
have
you
markel
was
fat
and
important
he
had
beady
black
eyes
fastidiously
trimmed
whiskers
and
a
pronounced
smirk
markel
blew
his
nose
vigorously
coughed
asthmatically
and
held
out
his
hand
of
course
certainly
said
he
effusively
i
met
carruthers
several
times
used
his
sheet
more
than
once
to
advertise
a
new
bond
the
dominant
note
in
markel
voice
was
an
ingratiating
and
unpleasant
whine
and
carruthers
nodded
not
very
cordially
and
shook
hands
markel
went
back
to
the
door
closed
it
carefully
and
returned
to
the
table
fact
is
he
smiled
confidentially
i
saw
you
two
come
in
here
a
few
minutes
ago
and
i
got
something
that
i
thought
carruthers
might
be
glad
to
have
for
his
society
column
say
in
the
sunday
he
dove
into
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
produced
a
large
morocco
leather
jeweller
case
and
holding
it
out
over
the
table
between
carruthers
and
jimmie
dale
suddenly
snapped
the
cover
open
and
then
with
a
complacent
little
chuckle
that
terminated
in
another
fit
of
coughing
spilled
the
contents
on
the
table
under
the
electric
reading
lamp
like
a
thing
of
living
pulsing
fire
it
rolled
before
their
eyes
a
magnificent
diamond
necklace
of
wondrous
beauty
gleaming
and
scintillating
as
the
light
rays
shot
back
from
a
thousand
facets
for
a
moment
both
men
gazed
at
it
without
a
word
little
surprise
for
my
wife
volunteered
markel
with
a
debonair
wave
of
his
pudgy
hand
and
trying
to
make
his
voice
sound
careless
the
case
lay
open
patently
displaying
the
name
of
the
most
famous
jewelry
house
in
america
jimmie
dale
eyes
fixed
on
markel
whiskers
where
they
were
brushed
outward
in
an
ornate
and
fastidious
sweep
by
jove
he
commented
you
do
do
things
by
halves
do
you
markel
two
hundred
and
ten
thousand
dollars
i
paid
for
that
little
bunch
of
gewgaws
said
markel
waving
his
hand
again
then
he
clapped
carruthers
heartily
on
the
shoulder
what
do
you
think
of
it
carruthers
eh
say
a
photograph
of
it
and
one
of
markel
eh
please
her
you
know
she
crazy
on
this
society
stunt
all
flubdub
to
me
of
course
how
it
strike
you
carruthers
carruthers
very
evidently
liked
neither
the
man
nor
his
manners
but
carruthers
above
everything
else
was
a
gentleman
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
markel
he
said
a
little
frigidly
i
do
believe
in
this
sort
of
thing
it
all
right
from
a
newspaper
standpoint
and
we
do
it
but
it
just
in
this
way
that
owners
of
valuable
jewelry
lay
themselves
open
to
theft
it
simply
amounts
to
advising
every
crook
in
the
country
that
you
have
a
quarter
of
a
million
at
his
disposal
which
he
can
carry
away
in
his
vest
pocket
once
he
can
get
his
hands
on
it
and
you
invite
him
to
jimmie
dale
laughed
what
carruthers
means
markel
is
that
you
have
the
gray
seal
down
your
street
carruthers
talks
of
crooks
generally
but
he
thinks
in
terms
of
only
one
he
ca
help
it
he
been
trying
so
long
to
catch
the
chap
that
it
become
an
obsession
eh
carruthers
carruthers
smiled
seriously
perhaps
he
admitted
i
hope
though
for
markel
sake
that
the
gray
seal
wo
take
a
fancy
to
it
if
he
does
markel
can
say
to
his
pouf
coughed
markel
arrogantly
overrated
his
cleverness
is
all
in
the
newspaper
columns
if
he
knows
what
good
for
him
he
know
enough
to
leave
this
jimmie
dale
was
leaning
over
the
table
poking
gingerly
with
the
tip
of
his
forefinger
at
the
centre
stone
in
the
setting
revolving
it
gently
to
and
fro
in
the
light
a
very
large
stone
whose
weight
would
hardly
be
less
than
fifteen
carats
jimmie
dale
lowered
his
head
for
a
closer
examination
and
to
hide
a
curious
mocking
little
gleam
that
crept
into
his
dark
eyes
yes
i
should
say
you
right
markel
he
agreed
judicially
he
ought
to
know
better
than
to
touch
this
it
it
would
be
too
hard
to
dispose
i
not
worrying
declared
markel
importantly
no
said
jimmie
dale
two
hundred
and
ten
thousand
you
said
any
special
er
significance
to
the
occasion
if
the
question
not
impertinent
birthday
wedding
anniversary
or
something
like
that
no
nothing
like
that
markel
grinned
winked
secretively
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
i
feeling
good
that
all
i
going
to
make
the
killing
of
my
life
oh
said
jimmie
dale
markel
turned
to
carruthers
i
let
you
in
on
that
too
carruthers
in
a
day
or
two
if
you
send
a
reporter
around
financial
man
you
know
it
be
worth
your
while
and
now
how
about
this
what
do
you
say
to
a
little
article
and
the
photos
next
sunday
there
was
a
slight
hint
of
rising
colour
in
carruthers
face
if
you
send
them
to
the
society
editor
i
no
doubt
he
be
able
to
use
them
he
said
brusquely
right
said
markel
and
coughed
and
patted
carruthers
shoulder
patronisingly
again
i
just
do
that
little
he
picked
up
the
necklace
dangled
it
till
it
flashed
and
flashed
again
under
the
light
then
restored
it
very
ostentatiously
to
its
case
and
the
case
to
his
pocket
thanks
awfully
carruthers
he
said
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
see
you
again
dale
carruthers
glared
at
the
door
as
it
closed
behind
the
man
say
it
prodded
jimmie
dale
sweetly
do
feel
restrained
because
you
are
a
guest
i
absolve
you
in
rotter
said
carruthers
well
said
jimmie
dale
softly
you
see
carruthers
carruthers
match
crackled
savagely
as
he
lighted
a
cigar
yes
i
see
he
growled
but
i
do
see
you
pardon
my
saying
so
how
vulgarity
like
that
ever
acquired
membership
in
the
james
carruthers
said
jimmie
dale
plaintively
you
ought
to
know
better
than
that
you
know
to
begin
with
since
it
seems
he
has
advertised
with
you
that
he
runs
some
sort
of
brokerage
business
in
boston
taken
a
summer
home
up
here
on
long
island
and
some
misguided
chap
put
him
on
the
club
visitor
list
his
card
will
not
be
renewed
sleek
customer
is
he
trifle
familiar
i
was
only
introduced
to
him
last
carruthers
grunted
broke
his
burned
match
into
pieces
and
began
to
toss
the
pieces
into
an
ash
tray
jimmie
dale
became
absorbed
in
an
inspection
of
his
hands
those
wonderful
hands
with
long
slim
tapering
fingers
whose
clean
pink
flesh
masked
a
strength
and
power
that
was
like
to
a
steel
vise
jimmie
dale
looked
up
going
to
print
a
nice
little
story
for
him
about
the
and
most
beautiful
necklace
in
america
he
inquired
innocently
carruthers
scowled
no
he
said
bluntly
i
am
not
he
read
the
a
long
time
before
he
reads
anything
about
that
but
therein
carruthers
was
wrong
the
carried
the
story
of
markel
diamond
necklace
in
caps
in
red
ink
on
the
front
page
in
the
next
morning
edition
and
carruthers
gloated
over
it
because
the
morning
was
the
only
paper
in
new
york
that
did
carruthers
was
to
hear
more
of
markel
and
markel
necklace
than
he
thought
though
for
the
time
being
the
subject
dropped
between
the
two
men
it
was
still
early
barely
ten
when
carruthers
left
the
club
and
preferring
to
walk
to
the
newspaper
offices
refused
jimmie
offer
of
his
limousine
it
was
but
five
minutes
later
when
jimmie
dale
after
chatting
for
a
moment
or
two
with
those
about
in
the
lobby
in
turn
sought
the
coat
room
where
markel
was
being
assisted
into
his
coat
getting
home
early
are
you
markel
remarked
jimmie
dale
pleasantly
yes
said
markel
and
ran
his
fingers
fussily
comb
fashion
through
his
whiskers
quite
a
little
run
out
to
my
place
you
know
and
with
you
know
what
i
do
care
to
be
out
too
no
of
course
concurred
jimmie
dale
getting
into
his
own
coat
they
walked
out
of
the
club
together
and
markel
climbed
importantly
into
the
tonneau
of
a
big
gray
touring
car
ah
home
peters
he
sniffed
at
his
chauffeur
and
then
with
a
grandiloquent
wave
of
his
hand
to
jimmie
dale
jimmie
dale
smiled
with
his
eyes
which
were
hidden
by
the
brim
of
his
hat
markel
he
replied
and
the
smile
crept
curiously
to
the
corners
of
his
mouth
as
he
watched
the
gray
car
disappear
down
the
street
a
limousine
drew
up
and
benson
jimmie
dale
chauffeur
opened
the
door
home
dale
he
asked
cheerily
touching
his
cap
yes
benson
home
said
jimmie
dale
absently
and
stepped
into
the
car
it
was
a
luxurious
car
as
everything
that
belonged
to
jimmie
dale
was
luxurious
and
he
leaned
back
luxuriously
on
the
cushions
extended
his
legs
luxuriously
to
their
full
length
plunged
his
hands
into
his
overcoat
pockets
and
then
a
change
stole
strangely
slowly
over
jimmie
dale
the
sensitive
fingers
of
his
right
hand
in
the
pocket
had
touched
and
now
played
delicately
over
a
sealed
envelope
that
they
had
found
there
played
over
it
as
though
indeed
by
the
sense
of
touch
alone
they
could
read
the
contents
and
he
drew
his
body
gradually
erect
it
was
another
of
those
mysterious
missives
from
her
the
texture
of
the
paper
was
invariably
the
same
like
this
one
how
had
it
come
there
collusion
with
the
coat
boy
at
the
club
that
was
hardly
probable
perhaps
it
had
been
there
before
he
had
entered
the
club
for
dinner
he
remembered
now
that
there
had
been
several
people
passing
and
that
he
had
been
jostled
slightly
in
crossing
the
sidewalk
what
however
did
it
matter
it
was
there
mysteriously
as
scores
of
others
had
come
to
him
mysteriously
with
never
a
clew
to
her
identity
to
the
identity
of
his
he
smiled
a
little
grimly
accomplice
in
crime
he
took
the
envelope
from
his
pocket
and
stared
at
it
his
fingers
had
not
been
at
fault
it
was
one
of
hers
the
faint
elusive
exquisite
fragrance
of
some
rare
perfume
came
to
him
as
he
held
it
i
give
said
jimmie
dale
wistfully
to
himself
i
give
everything
i
own
to
know
who
you
are
and
some
day
please
god
i
will
jimmie
dale
tore
the
envelope
very
gently
as
though
the
tearing
almost
were
an
act
of
desecration
and
extracted
the
letter
from
within
he
began
to
read
aloud
hurriedly
and
in
snatches

through

jimmie
dale
could
see
his
chauffeur
back
and
the
hand
that
held
the
letter
dropped
now
to
his
side
and
jimmie
dale
stared
at
his
chauffeur
back
then
presently
he
read
the
letter
again
as
though
committing
it
to
memory
now
and
then
tearing
the
paper
into
tiny
shreds
as
he
did
with
every
one
of
her
communications
he
reached
out
of
the
window
and
allowed
the
little
pieces
to
filter
gradually
from
his
hand
the
gray
seal
he
smiled
in
his
whimsical
way
if
it
were
ever
known
he
jimmie
dale
with
his
social
standing
his
wealth
his
position
the
gray
seal
not
a
police
official
not
a
bureau
probably
in
the
civilised
world
but
knew
the
name
not
a
man
woman
or
child
certainly
in
this
great
city
around
him
but
to
whom
it
was
as
familiar
as
their
own
danger
yes
a
battle
of
wits
yes
his
against
everybody
even
against
carruthers
his
old
college
chum
for
even
as
a
reporter
before
he
had
risen
to
the
editorial
desk
and
even
now
that
he
had
carruthers
had
been
one
of
the
keenest
on
the
scent
of
the
gray
seal
danger
yes
but
it
was
worth
it
worth
it
a
thousand
times
for
the
very
lure
of
the
danger
itself
but
worth
it
most
of
all
for
his
association
with
her
who
by
some
amazing
means
verging
indeed
on
the
miraculous
came
into
touch
with
all
these
things
and
supplied
him
with
the
data
on
which
to
work
that
always
some
wrong
might
be
righted
or
gladness
come
where
there
had
been
gloom
before
or
hope
where
there
had
been
despair
that
into
some
fellow
human
heart
should
come
a
gleam
of
sunshine
yes
in
spite
of
the
howls
of
the
police
the
virulent
diatribes
of
the
press
an
angry
public
screaming
for
his
arrest
conviction
and
punishment
there
were
those
perhaps
who
even
on
their
bended
knees
at
night
asked
god
blessing
on
the
gray
seal
was
it
strange
then
after
all
that
the
police
seeking
a
clew
through
motive
should
have
been
driven
to
frenzy
on
every
occasion
in
finding
themselves
forever
confronted
with
what
from
every
angle
they
were
able
to
view
it
was
quite
a
purposeless
crime
on
one
point
only
they
were
right
the
old
dogma
the
old
old
cry
old
as
the
institution
of
police
older
than
that
old
since
time
immemorial
cherchez
la
femme
quite
right
but
also
quite
purposeless
jimmie
dale
eyes
grew
wistful
he
had
been
hunting
for
the
woman
in
the
case
himself
now
for
months
and
years
indefatigably
using
every
resource
at
his
command
quite
purposelessly
jimmie
dale
shrugged
his
shoulders
why
go
over
all
this
there
were
other
things
to
do
she
had
come
to
him
again
and
this
time
with
a
matter
that
entailed
more
than
ordinary
difficulty
more
than
usual
danger
that
would
tax
his
wits
and
his
skill
to
the
utmost
not
only
to
succeed
but
to
get
out
of
it
himself
with
a
whole
skin
markel
eh
jimmie
dale
leaned
back
in
his
seat
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
his
eyes
half
closed
now
were
studying
benson
back
again
through
the
front
he
was
still
sitting
in
that
position
as
the
car
approached
his
residence
on
riverside
drive
but
as
it
came
to
a
stop
and
benson
opened
the
door
it
was
a
very
alert
jimmie
dale
that
stepped
to
the
sidewalk
benson
he
said
crisply
i
am
going
downtown
again
later
on
but
i
shall
drive
myself
bring
the
touring
car
around
and
leave
it
in
front
of
the
house
i
run
it
into
the
garage
when
i
get
back
you
need
not
wait
very
good
sir
said
benson
in
the
hallway
jason
the
butler
who
had
been
butler
to
jimmie
father
before
him
took
jimmie
dale
hat
and
coat
it
a
fine
evening
master
jim
said
the
privileged
old
man
affectionately
jimmie
dale
took
out
his
silver
cigarette
case
selected
a
cigarette
tapped
it
daintily
on
the
cover
of
the
case
and
accepted
the
match
the
old
man
hastily
produced
yes
said
jimmie
dale
pleasantly
facetious
it
a
fine
night
a
glorious
night
moon
and
stars
and
a
balmy
breeze
quite
too
fine
indeed
to
remain
indoors
in
fact
you
might
lay
out
my
gray
ulster
i
think
i
will
go
for
a
spin
presently
when
i
have
yes
sir
said
jason
anything
else
master
jim
no
that
all
jason
do
sit
up
for
me
you
may
go
to
bed
thank
you
sir
said
the
old
man
jimmie
dale
went
upstairs
opened
the
door
of
his
own
particular
den
on
the
right
of
the
landing
stepped
inside
closed
the
door
switched
on
the
light
and
jimmie
dale
debonair
nonchalance
dropped
from
him
as
a
mask
instantly
and
it
was
another
jimmie
dale
the
professional
jimmie
dale
quick
now
in
every
action
he
swung
aside
the
portiere
that
curtained
off
the
squat
safe
in
the
little
alcove
opened
the
safe
took
out
that
curious
leather
girdle
with
its
kit
of
burglar
tools
added
to
it
a
flashlight
and
an
automatic
revolver
closed
the
safe
and
passed
into
his
dressing
room
here
he
proceeded
to
divest
himself
rapidly
of
his
evening
clothes
selecting
in
their
stead
a
suit
of
dark
tweed
he
heard
jason
come
up
the
stairs
pass
along
the
hall
and
mount
the
second
flight
to
his
own
quarters
and
presently
came
the
sound
of
an
automobile
without
the
dressing
room
fronted
on
the
drive
jimmie
dale
looked
out
benson
was
just
getting
out
of
the
touring
car
slipping
the
leather
girdle
then
around
his
waist
jimmie
dale
put
on
his
vest
then
his
coat
and
walked
briskly
downstairs
jason
had
laid
out
a
gray
ulster
on
the
hall
stand
jimmie
dale
put
it
on
selected
a
leather
cap
with
attachment
that
pulled
down
almost
to
the
tip
of
his
nose
tucked
a
slouch
hat
into
the
pocket
of
the
ulster
and
leaving
the
house
climbed
into
his
car
he
glanced
at
his
watch
as
he
started
it
was
a
quarter
of
eleven
jimmie
dale
lips
pursed
a
little
i
guess
it
make
a
night
of
it
and
a
tight
squeeze
at
that
to
get
back
under
cover
before
daylight
he
muttered
i
have
to
do
some
tall
but
at
first
across
the
city
and
through
brooklyn
for
all
his
impatience
it
was
necessarily
slow
after
that
jimmie
dale
took
chances
and
once
on
the
country
roads
of
long
island
the
big
powerful
car
tore
through
the
night
like
a
greyhound
whose
leash
is
slipped
a
half
hour
passed
jimmie
dale
eyes
shifting
occasionally
from
the
gray
thread
of
road
ahead
of
him
under
the
glare
of
the
dancing
lamps
to
the
road
map
spread
out
at
his
feet
upon
which
from
time
to
time
he
focused
his
pocket
flashlight
and
then
finally
he
slowed
the
car
to
a
snail
pace
he
should
be
very
near
his
destination
that
very
subdivision
of
charleton
park
manor
on
either
side
of
the
road
now
was
quite
a
thickly
set
stretch
of
wooded
land
rising
slightly
on
the
right
and
this
jimmie
dale
scrutinised
sharply
in
fact
he
stopped
for
an
instant
as
he
came
opposite
to
a
wagon
track
it
seemed
to
be
little
more
than
that
that
led
in
through
the
trees
if
it
not
too
far
from
the
seat
of
war
commented
jimmie
dale
to
himself
as
he
went
on
again
it
will
do
and
then
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
jimmie
dale
nodded
his
head
in
satisfaction
he
was
passing
the
rather
ornate
stone
pillars
that
marked
the
entrance
to
charleton
park
manor
and
on
which
the
initial
promoters
of
the
subdivision
the
people
had
evidently
deemed
it
good
advertising
policy
to
expend
a
small
fortune
another
hundred
yards
farther
on
jimmie
dale
turned
his
car
around
and
returned
past
the
gates
to
the
wagon
track
again
the
road
was
deserted
not
a
car
nor
a
vehicle
of
any
description
was
in
sight
jimmie
dale
made
sure
of
that
and
in
another
instant
jimmie
dale
own
car
every
light
extinguished
had
vanished
he
had
backed
it
up
the
wagon
track
just
far
enough
in
for
the
trees
to
screen
it
thoroughly
from
the
main
road
nor
did
jimmie
dale
himself
appear
again
on
the
main
road
until
just
as
he
emerged
close
to
the
gates
of
charleton
park
manor
from
a
short
cut
through
the
woods
also
he
was
without
his
ulster
now
and
the
slouch
hat
had
replaced
the
motor
cap
jimmie
dale
in
the
moonlight
took
stock
of
his
surroundings
as
he
passed
in
at
a
businesslike
walk
through
the
gates
it
was
a
large
park
if
that
name
could
properly
be
applied
to
it
at
all
and
the
houses
he
caught
sight
of
one
set
back
from
the
driveway
on
the
right
were
quite
far
apart
each
in
its
own
rather
spacious
grounds
among
the
trees
the
second
house
on
the
right
her
letter
had
said
jimmie
dale
had
already
passed
the
first
one
the
next
would
be
markel
then
and
it
loomed
ahead
of
him
now
black
and
shadowy
and
unlighted
jimmie
dale
shot
a
glance
around
him
there
was
stillness
quiet
everywhere
no
sign
of
life
no
sound
jimmie
dale
face
became
tense
his
lips
tight
and
he
stepped
suddenly
from
the
sidewalk
in
among
the
trees
they
were
not
thick
here
of
course
the
trees
and
the
turf
beneath
his
feet
was
well
kept
and
therefore
soundless
he
moved
quickly
now
but
cautiously
from
tree
to
tree
for
the
moonlight
flooding
the
lawn
and
house
threw
all
objects
into
bold
relief
a
minute
two
three
went
by
and
a
shadow
flitted
here
and
there
across
the
sward
like
the
moving
of
the
trees
swaying
in
the
breeze
and
then
jimmie
dale
was
standing
close
up
against
one
side
of
the
house
hidden
by
the
protecting
black
shadows
of
the
walls
but
here
for
a
moment
jimmie
dale
seemed
little
occupied
with
the
house
itself
he
was
staring
down
past
its
length
to
where
the
woods
made
a
heavy
dark
background
at
the
rear
then
he
turned
his
head
to
face
directly
to
the
main
road
then
back
again
slowly
as
though
measuring
an
angle
jimmie
dale
had
no
intention
of
making
his
escape
by
the
roundabout
way
in
which
he
had
been
forced
to
come
in
order
to
make
certain
of
locating
the
right
house
the
second
one
from
the
gates
and
he
was
getting
the
bearings
of
his
car
and
the
wagon
track
now
i
guess
that
be
about
right
jimmie
dale
muttered
finally
and
now
for
he
slipped
along
the
side
of
the
house
and
halted
where
almost
on
a
level
with
the
ground
the
french
windows
of
the
dining
room
opened
on
the
lawn
jimmie
dale
tried
them
gently
they
were
locked
an
indulgent
smile
crept
to
jimmie
dale
lips
and
his
hand
crept
in
under
his
vest
it
came
out
again
not
empty
and
jimmie
dale
leaned
close
against
the
window
there
was
a
faint
almost
inaudible
scratching
sound
then
a
slight
brittle
crack
and
jimmie
dale
laid
a
neat
little
square
of
glass
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
through
the
aperture
he
reached
in
his
hand
turned
the
key
that
was
in
the
lock
turned
the
handle
pushed
the
doors
silently
open
wide
open
left
them
open
and
stepped
into
the
room
he
could
see
quite
well
within
thanks
to
the
moonlight
jimmie
dale
produced
a
black
silk
mask
from
one
of
the
little
leather
pockets
adjusted
it
carefully
over
his
face
and
crossed
the
room
to
the
hall
door
he
opened
this
wide
open
left
it
open
and
entered
the
hall
here
it
was
dark
a
pitch
blackness
he
stood
for
a
moment
listening
utter
silence
and
then
alert
strained
tense
in
an
instant
jimmie
dale
crouched
against
the
wall
and
then
he
smiled
a
little
grimly
it
was
only
some
one
coughing
upstairs
markel
in
his
sleep
perhaps
or
perhaps
in
wakefulness
i
a
fool
confided
jimmie
dale
to
himself
as
he
recognised
the
cough
that
he
had
heard
at
the
club
and
yet
i
do
know
nerves
get
sort
of
taut
pretty
stiff
business
if
i
ever
caught
the
penitentiary
sentence
i
get
will
be
the
smallest
part
of
what
to
a
round
button
of
light
played
along
the
wall
from
the
flashlight
in
his
hand
just
for
an
instant
and
all
was
blackness
again
but
in
that
instant
jimmie
dale
was
across
the
hall
and
his
fingers
were
tracing
the
telephone
connection
from
the
instrument
to
where
the
wires
disappeared
in
the
baseboard
of
the
floor
another
instant
and
he
had
severed
the
wires
with
a
pair
of
nippers
again
the
quick
firefly
gleam
of
light
to
locate
the
stair
case
and
the
library
door
opposite
to
it
and
moving
without
the
slightest
noise
jimmie
dale
hand
was
on
the
door
itself
again
he
paused
to
listen
all
was
silence
now
the
door
swung
under
his
hand
and
left
open
behind
him
he
was
in
the
room
the
flashlight
winked
once
suspiciously
then
he
snapped
its
little
switch
keeping
the
current
on
and
the
ray
dodged
impudently
here
and
there
all
over
the
apartment
the
safe
was
set
in
a
sort
of
clothes
closet
behind
the
desk
she
had
said
yes
there
it
was
the
door
at
least
jimmie
dale
moved
toward
it
and
paused
as
his
light
swept
the
top
of
the
intervening
desk
a
mass
of
papers
books
and
correspondence
littered
it
untidily
the
yellow
sheet
of
a
telegram
caught
jimmie
dale
eye
he
picked
it
up
and
glanced
at
it
it
read
vein
uncovered
undoubtedly
mother
lode
enormously
rich
put
the
screws
on
at
once
under
the
mask
jimmie
dale
lips
twitched
i
think
markel
you
miserable
hound
said
he
softly
that
god
will
forgive
me
for
depriving
you
of
a
share
of
the
profits
two
hundred
and
ten
thousand
i
think
it
was
you
said
the
sparklers
a
curious
little
sound
came
from
jimmie
dale
lips
like
a
chuckle
jimmie
dale
tossed
the
telegram
back
on
the
desk
moved
on
behind
the
desk
opened
the
door
of
the
closet
that
had
been
metamorphosed
into
a
vault
and
the
white
light
travelled
slowly
searchingly
critically
over
the
shining
steel
the
nickelled
knobs
and
dials
of
a
safe
that
confronted
him
jimmie
dale
nodded
at
it
familiarly
grimly
it
number
all
right
he
murmured
and
one
of
the
best
we
ever
made
pretty
tough
but
i
done
it
before
say
half
an
hour
of
gentle
persuasion
it
would
be
too
bad
to
crack
it
with
besides
that
crude
carruthers
would
never
forgive
the
gray
seal
for
that
the
light
went
out
blackness
fell
jimmie
dale
slim
sensitive
fingers
closed
on
the
dial
knob
his
head
touched
the
steel
front
of
the
safe
as
he
pressed
his
ear
against
it
for
the
tumblers
fall
and
then
silence
it
seemed
to
grow
heavier
that
silence
with
each
second
to
palpitate
through
the
quiet
house
to
grow
pregnant
premonitory
of
dread
of
fear
it
seemed
to
throb
in
long
undulations
and
the
stillness
grew
loud
a
moonbeam
filtered
in
between
the
edge
of
the
drawn
shade
and
the
edge
of
the
window
it
struggled
across
the
floor
in
a
wavering
path
strayed
over
the
desk
and
died
away
shadowy
and
formless
against
the
blackness
of
the
opened
recess
door
against
the
blackness
of
the
great
steel
safe
the
blackness
of
a
huddled
form
crouched
against
it
only
now
and
then
in
a
strange
projected
wraithlike
effect
the
moon
ray
glinted
timidly
on
the
tip
of
a
nickel
dial
and
ghostlike
disclosed
a
human
hand
upstairs
markel
coughed
again
then
from
the
safe
a
whisper
as
from
great
exertion
missed
it
the
dial
whirled
with
faint
musical
little
metallic
clicks
then
began
to
move
slowly
again
very
very
slowly
the
moonbeam
as
though
petulant
at
its
own
abortive
attempt
to
satisfy
its
curiosity
retreated
back
across
the
floor
and
faded
away
blackness
time
passed
then
from
the
safe
again
but
now
in
a
low
gasp
a
pant
of
relief
ah
the
ear
might
barely
catch
the
sound
it
was
as
of
metal
sliding
in
grooves
of
metal
meeting
metal
in
a
padded
thud
the
massive
door
swung
outward
jimmie
dale
stood
up
easing
his
cramped
muscles
and
flirted
the
sweat
beads
from
his
forehead
after
a
moment
he
knelt
again
there
was
still
the
inner
door
but
that
was
a
minor
matter
to
jimmie
dale
compared
with
what
had
gone
before
stillness
once
more
a
long
period
of
it
and
then
again
that
cough
from
above
a
prolonged
paroxysm
of
it
this
time
that
went
racketing
through
the
house
jimmie
dale
in
the
act
of
swinging
back
the
inner
door
of
the
safe
paused
to
listen
and
little
furrows
under
his
mask
gathered
on
his
forehead
the
coughing
stopped
jimmie
dale
waited
a
moment
still
listening
then
his
flashlight
bored
into
the
interior
of
the
safe
the
cash
box
probably
quoted
jimmie
dale
beneath
his
breath
and
picked
it
up
from
where
it
lay
in
the
bottom
compartment
of
the
safe
the
lock
snipped
under
the
insistent
probe
of
a
delicate
little
instrument
and
jimmie
dale
lifted
the
cover
there
was
a
package
of
papers
and
documents
on
top
held
together
with
elastic
bands
jimmie
dale
spent
a
moment
or
two
examining
these
then
his
fingers
dived
down
underneath
and
the
next
minute
under
the
flashlight
the
morocco
leather
case
open
the
diamond
necklace
was
sparkling
and
flashing
on
its
white
satin
bed
a
tempting
little
thing
is
it
said
jimmie
dale
gently
it
was
really
thoughtful
of
you
markel
to
buy
that
this
afternoon
jimmie
dale
replaced
the
necklace
in
the
cash
box
set
the
cash
box
on
the
floor
closed
the
inner
door
of
the
safe
and
swung
the
outer
door
a
little
inward
but
left
it
flauntingly
ajar
then
from
a
pocket
of
the
leather
girdle
beneath
his
vest
he
produced
his
small
thin
flat
metal
case
from
this
from
between
sheets
of
oil
paper
with
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
tweezers
he
lifted
out
a
gray
seal
jimmie
dale
was
apparently
fastidious
he
held
the
seal
with
the
tweezers
as
he
moistened
the
adhesive
side
with
his
tongue
laid
the
seal
on
his
handkerchief
and
pressed
the
handkerchief
firmly
against
the
safe
as
usual
jimmie
dale
insignia
bore
no
finger
prints
as
it
lay
neatly
capping
the
knob
of
the
dial
he
reached
down
picked
up
the
cash
box
and
then
for
the
second
time
that
night
held
suddenly
tense
alert
listening
his
every
muscle
taut
a
door
opened
upstairs
there
came
a
murmur
of
voices
then
a
momentary
lull
jimmie
dale
listened
like
a
statue
he
stood
there
in
the
black
absolutely
motionless
his
head
a
little
forward
and
to
one
side
nothing
not
a
sound
then
a
very
low
curious
swishing
noise
and
a
faint
creak
somebody
was
coming
down
the
stairs
jimmie
dale
moved
stealthily
from
the
recess
and
noiselessly
to
the
desk
very
faintly
but
distinctly
now
came
a
pad
of
either
slippered
or
bare
feet
on
the
stairway
carpet
like
a
cat
soundless
in
his
movements
jimmie
dale
crept
toward
the
door
of
the
room
down
the
stairs
came
that
pad
of
feet
occasionally
came
that
swishing
sound
nearer
the
door
crept
jimmie
dale
and
his
lips
were
thinned
now
his
jaws
clamped
how
near
were
they
together
he
and
this
night
prowler
at
times
he
could
not
hear
the
other
at
all
and
besides
the
heavy
carpet
made
the
judgment
of
distance
an
impossibility
if
he
could
gain
the
hall
and
in
the
darkness
elude
the
other
the
way
of
escape
through
the
dining
room
was
open
and
then
within
a
few
feet
of
the
door
jimmie
dale
halted
abruptly
as
a
woman
voice
rose
querulously
from
the
hallway
above
you
are
making
a
perfect
fool
of
yourself
theodore
markel
come
back
here
to
bed
jimmie
dale
face
hardened
like
stone
the
answer
came
almost
from
the
very
threshold
in
front
of
him
i
ca
sleep
i
tell
you
it
was
markel
voice
in
a
disgruntled
snarl
i
was
a
fool
to
bring
the
confounded
thing
home
i
going
to
take
the
library
couch
for
the
rest
of
the
it
happened
quick
then
quick
as
the
winking
of
an
eye
two
sharp
almost
simultaneous
clicks
of
the
buttons
pressed
by
markel
and
the
hall
and
library
were
a
flood
of
light
and
jimmie
dale
leaped
forward
to
where
in
dressing
gown
and
pajamas
blankets
and
bedding
over
one
arm
a
revolver
dangling
in
the
other
hand
markel
stood
full
before
the
door
in
the
hallway
without
there
was
a
wild
yell
of
terror
and
surprise
from
markel
then
a
deafening
roar
and
a
spit
of
flame
from
his
revolver
a
bitter
smothered
exclamation
from
jimmie
dale
as
the
cash
box
crashed
to
the
floor
from
his
left
hand
and
he
was
upon
the
other
like
a
tiger
with
the
impact
both
men
went
to
the
floor
grappled
and
rolled
over
and
over
half
mad
with
fear
shock
and
surprise
markel
fought
like
a
maniac
and
his
voice
in
gasping
shouts
rang
through
the
house
a
minute
two
passed
and
the
men
rolled
about
the
hall
floor
markel
over
middle
age
and
unheathily
fat
against
jimmie
dale
six
feet
of
muscle
only
jimmie
dale
left
hand
dripping
a
red
stream
now
was
almost
useless
from
above
came
wild
confusion
women
voices
in
little
shrieks
voices
shouting
in
excitement
doors
opening
running
feet
and
then
jimmie
dale
had
snatched
the
revolver
from
the
floor
where
markel
had
dropped
it
in
the
scuffle
and
was
pressing
it
against
forehead
and
markel
had
collapsed
in
a
flabby
pliant
heap
jimmie
dale
still
covering
markel
with
the
weapon
stood
up
the
frightened
faces
of
women
protruded
over
the
banisters
above
the
two
at
best
none
too
enthusiastically
on
the
way
down
stopped
as
though
stunned
as
jimmie
dale
swung
the
revolver
upon
them
then
jimmie
dale
spoke
to
markel
pointing
the
weapon
at
markel
again
i
do
like
you
markel
he
said
with
cold
impudence
the
only
decent
thing
you
ever
do
will
be
to
die
and
if
those
men
of
yours
on
the
stairs
move
another
step
it
will
be
your
death
warrant
do
you
understand
i
would
suggest
that
you
request
them
to
stay
where
they
cold
sweat
was
on
markel
face
as
he
stared
into
the
muzzle
of
the
revolver
and
his
teeth
chattered
go
back
he
screamed
hysterically
at
the
servants
go
back
sit
down
do
move
do
what
he
tells
you
thank
you
said
jimmie
dale
grimly
now
get
up
yourself
markel
got
up
jimmie
dale
backed
to
the
library
door
picked
up
the
cash
box
tucked
it
under
his
left
armpit
and
faced
those
on
the
stairs
mr
markel
and
i
are
going
out
for
a
little
walk
he
announced
coolly
if
one
of
you
make
a
move
or
raise
an
alarm
before
your
master
comes
back
i
shall
be
obliged
in
to
shoot
markel
markel
quite
understands
that
i
am
sure
do
you
not
markel
helen
screamed
markel
to
his
wife
do
let
move
for
sake
do
as
he
says
jimmie
dale
lips
just
showing
beneath
the
edge
of
his
mask
broadened
in
a
pleasant
little
smile
will
you
lead
the
way
markel
he
requested
with
ironic
deference
through
the
dining
room
please
yes
that
right
markel
walked
weakly
into
the
dining
room
and
jimmie
dale
followed
a
prod
in
the
back
from
the
revolver
muzzle
and
markel
stepped
through
the
french
windows
and
out
on
the
lawn
jimmie
dale
faced
the
other
toward
the
woods
at
the
rear
of
the
house
go
on
jimmie
dale
voice
was
curt
now
uncompromising
and
step
lively
they
passed
on
along
the
side
of
the
house
and
in
among
the
trees
fifty
yards
or
so
more
and
jimmie
dale
halted
he
backed
markel
up
against
a
large
tree
not
over
gently
i
i
say
markel
teeth
were
going
like
castanets
i
you
oblige
me
by
keeping
your
mouth
shut
observed
jimmie
dale
politely
and
he
whipped
the
cord
of
markel
dressing
gown
loose
and
began
to
tie
the
man
to
the
tree
you
have
many
unpleasant
characteristics
markel
your
voice
is
one
of
them
shall
i
repeat
that
i
do
not
like
you
he
stepped
to
the
back
of
the
tree
pardon
me
if
i
draw
this
uncomfortably
tight
i
do
think
you
can
reach
around
to
the
knot
no
the
trunk
is
too
large
quite
so
he
stepped
around
to
face
markel
again
the
man
was
thoroughly
frightened
his
face
was
livid
his
jaw
sagged
weakly
and
his
eyes
followed
every
movement
of
the
revolver
in
jimmie
dale
hand
in
a
sort
of
miserable
fascination
jimmie
dale
smiled
unhappily
i
am
going
to
do
something
markel
that
i
should
advise
no
other
man
to
do
i
am
going
to
put
you
on
your
honour
for
the
next
fifteen
minutes
you
are
not
to
utter
a
sound
do
you
understand
said
markel
hoarsely
no
said
jimmie
dale
sadly
i
don
think
you
do
let
me
be
painfully
explicit
if
you
break
your
vow
of
silence
by
so
much
as
a
second
then
or
the
next
day
or
the
day
after
at
my
convenience
markel
you
and
i
will
meet
again
for
the
last
time
there
can
be
no
possible
misapprehension
on
your
part
now
markel
markel
could
scarcely
chatter
out
the
word
quite
so
said
jimmie
dale
in
velvet
tones
he
stood
for
an
instant
looking
at
the
other
with
cool
insolence
then
markel
and
five
minutes
later
a
great
touring
car
was
tearing
new
yorkward
over
the
long
island
roads
at
express
speed
it
was
one
in
the
morning
as
jimmie
dale
swung
the
car
into
a
cross
street
off
lower
broadway
and
drew
up
at
the
curb
beside
a
large
office
building
he
got
out
snuggled
the
cash
box
under
his
ulster
went
around
to
the
broadway
entrance
glanced
up
to
note
that
a
light
burned
in
a
window
and
entered
the
building
the
hallway
was
practically
in
darkness
one
or
two
incandescents
only
threw
a
dim
light
about
jimmie
dale
stopped
for
a
moment
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
beside
the
elevator
well
to
listen
if
the
watchman
was
making
rounds
it
was
in
another
part
of
the
building
jimmie
dale
began
to
climb
he
reached
the
fifth
floor
turned
down
the
corridor
and
halted
in
front
of
a
door
through
the
panel
of
which
a
light
glowed
faintly
as
though
coming
from
an
inner
office
beyond
jimmie
dale
drew
the
black
silk
mask
from
his
pocket
adjusted
it
tried
the
door
found
it
unlocked
opened
it
noiselessly
and
stepped
inside
across
the
room
through
another
door
half
open
the
light
streamed
into
the
outer
office
where
jimmie
dale
stood
jimmie
dale
stole
across
the
room
crouched
by
the
door
to
look
into
the
inner
office
and
his
face
went
suddenly
rigid
good
god
he
whispered
as
bad
as
that
but
it
was
a
nonchalant
jimmie
dale
to
all
outward
appearances
that
on
the
instant
stepped
unconcernedly
over
the
threshold
an
elderly
man
save
now
that
the
face
was
drawn
and
haggard
the
eyes
full
of
weariness
was
standing
behind
a
desk
his
fingers
twitching
nervously
on
a
revolver
in
his
hand
he
whirled
with
a
startled
cry
at
jimmie
dale
entrance
and
the
revolver
clattered
from
his
fingers
to
the
floor
i
am
afraid
said
jimmie
dale
smiling
pleasantly
that
you
were
going
to
shoot
yourself
your
name
is
wilbur
henry
wilbur
is
it
unmanned
trembling
the
other
stood
and
nodded
mechanically
it
really
not
a
nice
thing
to
do
said
jimmie
dale
confidentially
makes
a
mess
you
see
too
he
was
pulling
off
his
motor
gauntlet
his
ulster
his
jacket
and
having
set
the
cash
box
on
the
desk
was
rolling
back
his
sleeve
as
he
spoke
had
a
little
experience
myself
this
he
held
out
his
hand
that
with
the
forearm
was
covered
with
blood
a
little
above
the
wrist
fortunately
only
a
flesh
wound
a
little
memento
from
a
chap
named
markel
and
markel
the
word
burst
quivering
from
the
other
lips
yes
said
jimmie
dale
imperturbably
do
you
mind
if
i
wash
a
bit
and
could
you
oblige
me
with
a
towel
or
something
that
would
do
for
a
bandage
the
man
seemed
dazed
in
a
subconscious
way
he
walked
from
the
desk
to
a
little
cupboard
and
took
out
two
towels
jimmie
dale
stooped
while
the
other
back
was
turned
picked
up
the
revolver
from
the
floor
and
slipped
it
into
his
trousers
pocket
markel
said
wilbur
again
the
same
trembling
anxiety
in
his
voice
as
he
handed
jimmie
dale
the
towels
and
motioned
toward
a
washstand
in
the
corner
of
the
room
did
you
say
markel
theodore
markel
yes
said
jimmie
dale
examining
his
wound
critically
you
had
trouble
a
fight
with
him
is
he
he
dead
no
said
jimmie
dale
smiling
a
little
grimly
he
pretty
badly
hurt
though
i
imagine
but
not
in
a
physical
strange
whispered
wilbur
in
a
numbed
tone
to
himself
and
he
went
back
and
sank
down
in
his
desk
chair
strange
that
you
should
speak
of
markel
strange
that
you
should
have
come
here
jimmie
dale
did
not
answer
he
glanced
now
and
then
at
the
other
as
he
deftly
dressed
his
wrist
the
man
seemed
on
the
verge
of
collapse
on
the
verge
of
a
nervous
breakdown
jimmie
dale
swore
softly
to
himself
wilbur
was
too
old
a
man
to
be
called
upon
to
stand
against
the
trouble
and
anxiety
that
was
mirrored
in
the
misery
in
his
face
that
had
brought
him
to
the
point
of
taking
his
own
life
jimmie
dale
put
on
his
coat
again
walked
over
to
the
desk
and
picked
up
the
if
i
may
he
inquired
courteously
and
confided
a
number
to
the
mouthpiece
of
the
instrument
there
was
a
moment
wait
during
which
wilbur
in
a
desperate
sort
of
way
seemed
to
be
trying
to
rally
himself
to
piece
together
a
puzzle
as
it
were
and
for
the
first
time
he
appeared
to
take
a
personal
interest
in
the
masked
figure
that
leaned
against
his
desk
he
kept
passing
his
hands
across
his
eyes
staring
at
jimmie
dale
then
jimmie
dale
spoke
into
the
morning
office
carruthers
please
thank
another
wait
then
jimmie
dale
voice
changed
its
pitch
and
register
to
a
pleasant
and
natural
though
quite
unrecognisable
bass
mr
carruthers
yes
i
thought
it
might
interest
you
to
know
that
theodore
markel
purchased
a
very
valuable
diamond
necklace
this
afternoon
oh
you
knew
that
did
you
well
so
much
the
better
you
be
all
the
more
keenly
interested
to
know
that
it
is
no
longer
in
his
possession
i
beg
pardon
oh
yes
i
quite
forgot
this
is
the
gray
seal
speaking
yes
the
gray
seal
i
have
just
come
from
markel
country
house
and
if
you
hurry
a
man
out
there
you
ought
to
be
able
to
give
the
public
an
exclusive
bit
of
news
a
scoop
i
believe
you
call
it
you
see
carruthers
i
am
not
ungrateful
for
i
might
say
the
eulogistic
manner
in
which
the
morning
treated
me
in
that
last
affair
and
i
trust
i
shall
be
able
to
do
you
many
more
favours
i
am
deeply
in
your
debt
and
oh
yes
tell
your
reporter
not
to
overlook
the
detail
of
markel
in
his
pajamas
and
dressing
gown
tied
to
a
tree
in
his
park
markel
might
be
inclined
to
be
reticent
on
that
point
and
it
would
be
a
pity
to
deprive
the
public
of
any
er
in
the
story
you
know
what
no
i
am
afraid
markel
is
er
out
of
order
yes
and
by
the
way
speaking
of
carruthers
between
gentlemen
i
know
you
will
make
no
effort
under
the
circumstances
to
discover
the
number
i
am
calling
from
jimmie
dale
hung
the
receiver
abruptly
on
the
hook
you
see
said
jimmie
dale
turning
to
wilbur
and
then
he
stopped
the
man
was
on
his
feet
swaying
there
his
face
positively
gray
my
god
wilbur
burst
out
what
have
you
done
a
thousand
times
better
if
i
had
shot
myself
as
i
would
have
done
in
another
moment
if
you
had
not
come
in
i
was
only
ruined
then
i
am
disgraced
now
you
have
robbed
markel
safe
i
am
the
one
man
in
the
world
who
would
have
a
reason
above
all
others
for
doing
that
and
markel
knows
it
he
will
accuse
me
of
it
he
can
prove
i
had
a
motive
i
have
not
been
home
nobody
knows
i
am
here
i
can
not
prove
an
alibi
what
have
you
done
really
said
jimmie
dale
almost
plaintively
swinging
himself
up
on
the
corner
of
the
desk
and
taking
the
cash
box
on
his
knee
really
you
are
alarming
yourself
unnecessarily
i
but
wilbur
stopped
him
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
wilbur
cried
out
in
a
choked
way
then
his
voice
steadying
he
rushed
on
listen
i
am
a
ruined
man
absolutely
ruined
and
markel
has
ruined
me
i
did
not
see
through
his
trick
until
too
late
listen
for
years
as
a
mining
engineer
i
made
a
good
salary
and
i
saved
it
two
years
ago
i
had
nearly
seventy
thousand
dollars
it
represented
my
life
work
i
bought
an
abandoned
mine
in
alaska
for
next
to
nothing
i
was
certain
it
was
rich
a
man
by
the
name
of
thurl
jason
thurl
another
mining
engineer
a
steamer
acquaintance
was
out
there
at
the
time
he
was
a
partner
of
markel
though
i
did
know
it
then
i
started
to
work
the
mine
it
did
pan
out
i
dropped
nearly
every
cent
then
i
struck
a
small
vein
that
temporarily
recouped
me
and
supplied
the
necessary
funds
with
which
to
go
ahead
for
a
while
thurl
who
had
tried
to
buy
the
mine
out
from
under
my
option
in
the
first
place
repeatedly
then
tried
to
buy
it
from
me
at
a
ridiculous
figure
i
refused
he
persisted
i
refused
i
was
confident
i
knew
i
had
one
of
the
richest
properties
in
wilbur
paused
a
little
row
of
glistening
drops
had
gathered
on
his
forehead
jimmie
dale
balancing
markel
cash
box
on
one
knee
drummed
softly
with
his
finger
tips
on
the
cover
the
vein
petered
out
wilbur
went
on
but
i
was
still
confident
i
sank
all
the
proceeds
of
the
first
strike
and
sank
them
fast
for
unaccountable
accidents
that
crippled
me
both
financially
and
in
the
progress
of
the
work
began
to
wilbur
flung
out
his
hands
impotently
oh
it
a
long
story
too
long
to
tell
thurl
was
at
the
bottom
of
those
accidents
he
knew
as
well
as
i
did
that
the
mine
was
rich
better
than
i
did
for
that
matter
for
we
discovered
before
we
ran
him
out
of
alaska
that
he
had
made
secret
borings
on
the
property
but
what
i
did
not
know
until
a
few
hours
ago
was
that
he
had
actually
uncovered
what
we
uncovered
only
yesterday
the
mother
lode
he
was
driving
me
as
fast
as
he
could
into
the
last
ditch
for
markel
i
did
know
until
yesterday
that
markel
had
any
thing
to
do
with
it
i
struggled
on
out
there
hoping
every
day
to
open
a
new
vein
i
raised
money
on
everything
i
had
except
my
insurance
and
the
mine
and
sank
it
in
the
mine
no
one
out
there
would
advance
me
anything
on
a
property
that
looked
like
a
failure
that
had
once
already
been
abandoned
i
have
always
kept
an
office
here
and
i
came
back
east
with
the
idea
of
raising
something
on
my
insurance
markel
quite
by
haphazard
as
i
then
thought
was
introduced
to
me
just
before
we
left
san
francisco
on
our
way
to
new
york
on
the
run
across
the
continent
we
became
very
friendly
naturally
i
told
him
my
story
he
played
sympathetic
good
fellow
and
offered
to
lend
me
fifty
thousand
dollars
on
a
demand
note
i
did
not
want
to
be
involved
for
a
cent
more
than
was
necessary
and
as
i
said
i
hoped
from
day
to
day
to
make
another
strike
i
refused
to
take
more
than
ten
thousand
i
remember
now
that
he
seemed
strangely
again
wilbur
stopped
he
swept
the
moisture
from
his
forehead
and
his
fist
clenched
came
down
upon
the
desk
you
see
the
game
there
was
bitter
anger
in
his
voice
now
you
see
the
game
he
wanted
to
get
me
in
deep
enough
so
that
i
could
wriggle
out
deeper
than
ten
thousand
that
i
could
get
at
any
time
on
my
insurance
he
wanted
me
where
i
could
get
away
and
he
got
me
the
first
ten
thousand
was
enough
i
went
to
him
for
a
second
a
third
a
fourth
a
fifth
hoping
always
that
each
would
be
the
last
each
time
a
new
note
a
demand
note
for
the
total
amount
was
made
cancelling
the
former
one
i
did
know
his
game
did
suspect
it
i
blessed
god
for
giving
me
such
a
friend
until
this
or
rather
yesterday
afternoon
when
i
received
a
telegram
from
my
manager
at
the
mine
saying
that
he
had
struck
what
looked
like
a
very
rich
vein
the
mother
lode
and
wilbur
fist
curled
until
the
knuckles
were
like
ivory
in
their
whiteness
he
added
in
the
telegram
that
thurl
had
wired
the
news
of
the
strike
to
a
man
in
new
york
by
the
name
of
markel
do
you
see
i
had
had
the
telegram
five
minutes
when
a
messenger
brought
me
a
letter
from
markel
curtly
informing
me
that
i
would
have
to
meet
my
note
morning
i
ca
meet
it
he
knew
i
could
with
wealth
in
sight
i
wiped
out
a
demand
note
a
call
loan
do
you
understand
and
with
a
few
months
in
which
to
develop
the
new
vein
i
could
pay
it
readily
as
it
is
i
default
the
note
markel
attaches
all
i
have
left
which
is
the
mine
the
mine
is
sold
to
satisfy
my
indebtedness
markel
buys
it
in
legally
upheld
by
the
law
and
acquires
robs
me
of
it
and
and
so
said
jimmie
dale
musingly
you
were
going
to
shoot
yourself
wilbur
straightened
up
and
there
was
something
akin
to
pathetic
grandeur
in
the
set
of
the
old
shoulders
as
they
squared
back
yes
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
shall
i
tell
you
why
even
if
which
is
not
likely
there
was
something
reverting
to
me
over
the
purchase
price
it
would
be
a
paltry
thing
compared
with
the
mine
i
have
a
wife
and
children
if
i
have
worked
for
them
all
my
life
could
i
stand
back
now
at
the
last
and
see
them
robbed
of
their
inheritance
by
a
scoundrel
when
i
could
still
lift
a
hand
to
prevent
it
i
had
one
way
left
what
is
my
life
i
am
too
old
a
man
to
cling
to
it
where
they
are
concerned
i
have
referred
to
my
insurance
several
times
i
have
always
carried
heavy
insurance
he
smiled
a
little
curious
mirthless
smile
that
has
no
suicide
he
swept
his
hand
over
the
desk
indicating
the
papers
scattered
there
i
have
worked
late
getting
my
affairs
in
order
my
total
insurance
is
thousand
dollars
though
i
could
borrow
anywhere
near
the
full
amount
on
it
but
at
my
death
paid
in
full
it
would
satisfy
the
note
my
executors
by
instruction
would
pay
the
note
and
no
dollar
from
the
mine
no
single
grain
of
gold
not
an
ounce
of
quartz
would
markel
ever
get
his
hands
on
and
my
wife
and
children
would
be
saved
that
is
his
words
ended
abruptly
with
a
little
gasp
jimmie
dale
had
opened
the
cash
box
and
was
dangling
the
necklace
under
the
light
a
stream
of
fiery
flashing
sparkling
gems
then
wilbur
spoke
again
a
hard
bitter
note
in
his
voice
pointing
his
hand
at
the
necklace
but
now
on
top
of
everything
you
have
brought
me
disgrace
because
you
broke
into
his
safe
for
that
he
would
and
will
accuse
me
i
have
heard
of
you
the
gray
seal
you
have
done
a
pitiful
night
work
in
your
greed
for
that
thing
for
this
jimmie
dale
smiled
ironically
holding
the
necklace
up
then
he
shook
his
head
i
did
break
into
markel
safe
for
this
it
would
have
been
worth
while
it
only
paste
exclaimed
wilbur
in
a
slow
way
paste
said
jimmie
dale
placidly
dropping
the
necklace
back
into
its
case
quite
in
keeping
with
markel
is
it
to
make
a
sensation
on
the
cheap
but
that
does
change
matters
wilbur
cried
out
sharply
after
a
numbed
instant
pause
you
still
broke
into
the
safe
even
if
you
did
know
then
that
the
necklace
was
ah
but
you
see
i
did
know
then
said
jimmie
dale
softly
i
am
really
you
must
take
my
word
for
it
a
very
good
judge
of
stones
and
i
had
er
seen
these
wilbur
stared
bewildered
confused
then
why
what
was
it
that
a
paper
said
jimmie
dale
with
a
little
chuckle
and
produced
it
from
the
cash
box
it
reads
like
this
demand
i
promise
to
pay
my
note
it
came
in
a
great
surging
cry
from
wilbur
and
he
strained
forward
to
read
it
of
course
said
jimmie
dale
of
course
your
note
did
you
think
that
i
had
just
happened
to
drop
in
on
you
now
then
see
here
you
just
buck
up
and
er
smile
there
is
even
a
possibility
of
you
being
accused
of
the
theft
in
the
first
place
markel
saw
quite
enough
of
me
to
know
that
it
was
you
secondly
neither
markel
nor
any
one
else
would
ever
dream
that
the
break
was
made
for
anything
else
but
the
necklace
with
which
you
have
no
connection
the
papers
were
in
the
cash
box
and
were
just
taken
along
with
it
do
you
see
and
besides
the
police
with
my
very
good
friend
carruthers
at
their
elbows
will
see
very
thoroughly
to
it
that
the
gray
seal
gets
full
and
ample
credit
for
the
crime
but
jimmie
dale
pulled
out
his
watch
and
yawned
under
his
mask
it
getting
to
be
an
unconscionable
hour
and
you
still
a
letter
to
a
letter
wilbur
voice
was
broken
his
lips
quivering
to
markel
said
jimmie
dale
pleasantly
write
him
in
reply
to
his
letter
of
the
afternoon
and
post
it
before
you
leave
here
just
as
though
you
had
written
it
at
once
promptly
on
receipt
of
his
he
will
still
get
it
on
the
morning
delivery
state
that
you
will
take
up
the
note
immediately
on
presentation
at
whatever
bank
he
chooses
to
name
that
all
seeing
that
he
has
got
it
he
ca
very
well
present
it
can
he
eventually
having
er
no
use
for
fake
diamonds
i
shall
return
the
necklace
together
with
the
papers
in
his
cash
box
here
including
your
eventually
uncomprehendingly
stumblingly
wilbur
repeated
the
word
in
a
month
or
two
or
three
as
the
case
may
be
explained
jimmie
dale
brightly
whenever
you
insert
a
personal
in
the
to
the
effect
that
the
mother
lode
has
given
you
the
cash
to
meet
he
replaced
the
note
in
the
cash
box
slipped
down
to
his
feet
from
the
desk
and
then
he
choked
a
little
wilbur
the
tears
streaming
down
his
face
unable
to
speak
was
holding
out
his
hands
to
jimmie
dale
i
er
said
jimmie
dale
hurriedly
and
stepped
quickly
from
the
room
halfway
down
the
first
flight
of
stairs
he
paused
steps
running
after
him
sounded
along
the
corridor
above
and
then
wilbur
voice

cried
the
old
man
i
do
understand
how
did
you
know
who
told
you
about
the
note
jimmie
dale
did
not
answer
he
went
on
noiselessly
down
the
stairs
his
mask
was
off
now
and
his
lips
curved
into
a
strange
little
smile
i
wish
i
knew
said
jimmie
dale
wistfully
to
himself
chapter
iv
the
counterfeit
five
it
was
still
early
in
the
evening
but
a
little
after
nine
the
fifth
avenue
bus
wended
its
way
jouncing
its
patrons
particularly
those
on
the
top
seats
across
town
and
turned
into
riverside
drive
a
short
distance
behind
the
bus
a
limousine
rolled
down
the
cross
street
leisurely
silently
as
the
lights
of
passing
craft
on
the
hudson
and
a
myriad
scintillating
luminous
points
dotting
the
west
shore
came
into
view
jimmie
dale
rose
impulsively
from
his
seat
on
the
top
of
the
bus
descended
the
little
circular
iron
ladder
at
the
rear
and
dropped
off
into
the
street
it
was
only
a
few
blocks
farther
to
his
residence
on
the
drive
and
the
night
was
well
worth
the
walk
besides
restless
disturbed
and
perplexed
in
mind
the
walk
appealed
to
him
he
stepped
across
to
the
sidewalk
and
proceeded
slowly
along
a
month
had
gone
by
and
he
had
not
heard
a
word
from
her
the
break
on
west
broadway
the
murder
of
metzer
in
moriarty
gambling
hell
the
theft
of
markel
diamond
necklace
had
followed
each
other
in
quick
succession
and
then
this
month
of
utter
silence
with
no
sign
of
her
as
though
indeed
she
had
never
existed
but
it
was
not
this
temporary
silence
on
her
part
that
troubled
jimmie
dale
now
in
the
years
that
he
had
worked
with
this
unknown
mysterious
accomplice
of
his
whom
he
had
never
seen
there
had
been
longer
intervals
than
a
bare
month
in
which
he
had
heard
nothing
from
her
it
was
not
that
it
was
the
failure
total
absolute
and
complete
that
was
the
only
result
for
the
month
of
ceaseless
unremitting
effort
even
as
it
had
been
the
result
many
times
before
in
an
attempt
to
solve
the
enigma
that
was
so
intimate
and
vital
a
factor
in
his
own
life
if
he
might
lay
any
claims
to
cleverness
his
resourcefulness
at
least
he
was
forced
to
admit
was
no
match
for
hers
she
came
she
went
without
being
seen
and
behind
her
remained
instead
of
clews
to
her
identity
only
an
amazing
intangible
mystery
that
left
him
at
times
appalled
and
dismayed
how
did
she
know
about
those
conditions
in
west
broadway
how
did
she
know
about
metzer
murder
how
did
she
know
about
markel
and
wilbur
how
did
she
know
about
a
hundred
other
affairs
of
the
same
sort
that
had
happened
since
that
night
years
ago
now
when
out
of
pure
adventure
he
had
tampered
with
marx
the
jeweller
strong
room
in
maiden
lane
and
she
had
mysteriously
then
too
solved
his
identity
discovered
him
to
be
the
gray
seal
jimmie
dale
wrapped
up
in
his
own
thoughts
entirely
oblivious
to
his
surroundings
traversed
another
block
there
had
never
been
since
the
world
began
and
there
would
never
be
again
so
singular
and
bizarre
a
partnership
as
this
of
hers
and
his
he
jimmie
dale
with
his
strange
double
life
one
of
new
york
young
bachelor
millionaires
one
whose
social
status
was
unquestioned
and
she
who
who
what
that
was
just
it
who
what
what
was
she
what
was
her
name
what
one
personal
intimate
thing
did
he
know
about
her
and
what
was
to
be
the
end
not
that
he
would
have
severed
his
association
with
her
not
for
worlds
though
every
time
that
by
some
new
and
curious
method
one
of
her
letters
found
its
way
into
his
hands
outlining
some
fresh
coup
for
him
to
execute
his
peril
and
danger
of
discovery
was
increased
in
staggering
ratio
the
police
hunted
the
gray
seal
as
they
hunted
a
mad
dog
the
papers
stormed
and
raved
against
him
in
every
detective
bureau
of
two
continents
he
was
catalogued
as
the
most
notorious
criminal
of
the
age
and
yet
strange
paradox
no
single
crime
had
ever
been
committed
jimmie
dale
strong
face
lighted
up
crime
thanks
to
her
there
were
those
who
blessed
the
name
of
the
gray
seal
those
into
whose
lives
had
come
joy
relief
from
misery
escape
from
death
even
and
their
blessings
were
worth
a
thousandfold
the
risk
and
peril
of
disaster
that
threatened
him
at
every
minute
of
the
day
thank
god
for
her
murmured
jimmie
dale
softly
but
but
if
i
could
only
find
her
see
her
know
who
she
is
talk
to
her
and
hear
her
voice
then
he
smiled
a
little
wanly
it
been
a
pretty
tough
month
and
nothing
to
show
for
it
it
had
it
had
been
one
of
the
hardest
months
through
which
jimmie
dale
had
ever
lived
the
james
that
most
exclusive
club
his
favourite
haunt
had
seen
nothing
of
him
the
easel
in
his
den
that
was
his
hobby
had
been
untouched
there
had
been
days
even
when
he
had
not
crossed
the
threshold
of
his
home
every
resource
at
his
command
he
had
called
into
play
in
an
effort
to
solve
the
mystery
for
nearly
the
entire
month
following
first
this
lead
and
then
that
he
had
lived
in
the
one
disguise
that
he
felt
confident
she
knew
nothing
of
that
was
or
rather
had
become
almost
a
dual
personality
with
him
from
the
sanctuary
that
miserable
and
disreputable
room
in
a
tenement
on
the
east
side
a
tenement
that
had
three
separate
means
of
entrance
and
exit
he
had
emerged
day
after
day
as
larry
the
bat
a
character
as
well
known
and
as
well
liked
in
the
exclusive
circles
of
the
underworld
as
was
jimmie
dale
in
the
most
exclusive
strata
of
new
york
society
and
fashion
and
it
had
been
useless
all
useless
through
his
own
endeavours
through
the
help
of
his
friends
of
the
underworld
the
lives
of
half
a
dozen
men
bert
hagan
on
west
broadway
for
instance
markel
and
others
had
been
laid
bare
to
the
last
shred
but
nowhere
could
be
found
the
one
vital
point
that
linked
their
lives
with
hers
that
would
account
for
her
intimate
knowledge
of
them
and
so
furnish
him
with
the
clew
that
would
then
with
certainty
lead
him
to
a
solution
of
her
identity
it
was
baffling
puzzling
unbelievable
bordering
indeed
on
the
miraculous
herself
everything
about
her
her
acts
her
methods
her
cleverness
intangible
in
one
sense
were
terrifically
real
in
another
jimmie
dale
shook
his
head
the
miraculous
and
this
practical
everyday
life
were
wide
and
far
apart
there
was
nothing
miraculous
about
it
it
was
only
that
the
key
to
it
was
so
far
beyond
his
reach
and
then
suddenly
jimmie
dale
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
consonance
with
a
whimsical
change
in
both
mood
and
thought
larry
the
bat
is
a
hard
taskmaster
he
muttered
facetiously
afraid
i
not
very
presentable
this
evening
no
bath
this
morning
and
no
shave
and
after
nearly
a
month
of
that
beastly
grease
paint
gets
into
the
skin
creases
in
a
most
intimate
he
chuckled
as
the
thought
of
old
jason
his
butler
came
to
him
i
saw
jason
torn
between
two
conflicting
emotions
shaking
his
head
over
the
black
circles
under
my
eyes
last
night
he
did
know
whether
to
worry
over
the
first
signs
of
a
galloping
decline
or
break
his
heart
at
witnessing
the
young
master
he
had
dandled
on
his
knees
going
to
the
damnation
bowwows
and
turning
into
a
confirmed
roue
i
guess
i
have
to
mind
myself
though
even
carruthers
detached
his
mind
far
enough
from
his
editorial
desk
and
the
hope
of
exclusively
publishing
the
news
of
the
gray
seal
capture
in
the
morning
to
tell
me
i
was
looking
seedy
it
wonderful
the
way
a
little
paint
will
metamorphose
a
man
well
anyway
here
for
a
good
hot
tub
and
a
fresh
start
he
quickened
his
pace
there
were
still
three
blocks
to
go
and
here
was
no
hurrying
jostling
crowd
to
impede
his
progress
indeed
as
far
as
he
could
see
up
the
drive
there
was
not
a
pedestrian
in
sight
and
then
as
he
walked
involuntarily
insistently
his
mind
harked
back
into
the
old
groove
again
i
tried
to
picture
her
said
jimmie
dale
softly
to
himself
tried
to
picture
her
a
hundred
yes
a
thousand
times
and
a
bus
rumbling
cityward
went
by
him
squeaking
creaking
and
rattling
in
its
uneasy
joints
and
out
of
the
noise
almost
at
his
elbow
it
seemed
a
voice
spoke
his
name
and
in
that
instant
intuitively
he
knew
and
it
thrilled
him
stopped
the
beat
of
his
heart
as
dulcet
soft
clear
as
the
note
of
a
silver
bell
it
fell
and
only
one
word
jimmie
he
whirled
around
a
limousine
wheels
just
grazing
the
curb
was
gliding
slowly
and
silently
past
him
and
from
the
window
a
arm
and
dainty
was
extended
and
from
the
fingers
to
the
pavement
fluttered
an
envelope
and
the
car
leaped
forward
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
jimmie
dale
stood
dazed
immovable
a
gamut
of
emotions
surprise
fierce
exultation
amazement
a
strange
joy
a
mighty
uplift
swirling
upon
him
and
then
snatching
up
the
envelope
from
the
ground
he
sprang
out
into
the
road
after
the
car
it
was
the
one
chance
he
had
ever
had
the
one
chance
she
had
ever
given
him
and
he
had
seen
a
arm
he
could
not
reach
the
car
it
was
speeding
away
from
him
like
an
arrow
now
but
there
was
something
else
that
would
do
just
as
well
something
that
with
all
her
cleverness
she
had
overlooked
the
car
number
dangling
on
the
rear
axle
the
rays
of
the
little
lamp
playing
on
the
enamelled
surface
of
the
plate
gasping
panting
he
held
his
own
for
a
yard
or
more
and
there
floated
back
to
him
a
little
silvery
laugh
from
the
body
of
the
limousine
and
then
jimmie
dale
laughed
too
and
stopped
it
was
no
he
stood
and
watched
the
car
disappear
up
the
drive
what
delicious
irony
a
month
of
gruelling
ceaseless
toil
that
had
been
vain
futile
useless
and
the
key
when
he
was
not
looking
for
it
unexpectedly
through
no
effort
of
his
was
thrust
into
his
hand
no
jimmie
dale
the
gently
ironic
smile
still
on
his
lips
those
slim
supersensitive
fingers
of
his
subconsciously
noting
that
the
texture
of
the
envelope
was
the
same
as
she
always
used
retraced
his
steps
to
the
sidewalk
number
fifteen
thousand
eight
hundred
and
said
jimmie
dale
aloud
and
halted
at
the
curb
as
though
rooted
to
the
spot
it
sounded
strangely
familiar
that
number
he
repeated
it
over
again
slowly
and
the
smile
left
his
lips
and
upon
his
face
came
the
look
of
a
chastened
child
she
had
used
a
duplicate
plate
fifteen
thousand
eight
hundred
and
was
the
number
of
one
of
his
own
cars
his
own
particular
runabout
for
a
moment
longer
he
stood
there
undecided
whether
to
laugh
or
swear
and
then
his
eyes
fastened
mechanically
on
the
envelope
he
was
twirling
in
his
fingers
here
at
least
was
something
that
was
not
elusive
that
on
the
contrary
as
a
hundred
others
in
the
past
had
done
outlined
probably
a
grim
night
work
ahead
for
the
gray
seal
and
if
it
were
as
those
others
had
been
every
minute
from
the
moment
of
its
receipt
was
precious
time
he
stepped
under
the
nearest
street
light
and
tore
the
envelope
open
dear
philanthropic
crook
it
began
and
then
followed
two
closely
written
pages
jimmie
dale
read
them
his
lips
growing
gradually
tighter
a
smouldering
light
creeping
into
his
dark
eyes
and
once
he
emitted
a
short
low
whistle
of
consternation
that
was
at
the
end
as
he
read
the
that
was
heavily
underscored
work
quickly
they
will
raid
be
careful
look
out
for
kline
he
is
the
sharpest
man
in
the
united
states
secret
for
a
brief
instant
longer
jimmie
dale
stood
under
the
street
lamp
his
mind
in
a
way
cataloguing
every
point
in
her
letter
viewing
every
point
from
a
myriad
angles
constructing
devising
mapping
out
a
plan
to
into
them
and
then
jimmie
dale
swung
on
a
downtown
bus
there
was
neither
time
nor
occasion
to
go
home
now
that
marvellous
little
kit
of
burglar
tools
that
peeped
from
their
tiny
pockets
in
that
curious
leather
undervest
and
that
reposed
now
in
the
safe
in
his
den
would
be
useless
to
him
besides
in
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
neatly
folded
was
a
black
silk
mask
and
relics
of
his
role
of
larry
the
bat
an
automatic
revolver
an
electric
flashlight
a
steel
jimmy
and
a
bunch
of
skeleton
keys
were
distributed
among
the
other
pockets
of
his
smart
tweed
suit
jimmie
dale
changed
from
the
bus
to
the
subway
leaving
behind
him
strewn
over
many
blocks
the
tiny
and
minute
fragments
into
which
he
had
torn
her
letter
at
astor
place
he
left
the
subway
walked
to
broadway
turned
uptown
for
a
block
to
eighth
street
then
along
eighth
street
almost
to
sixth
avenue
and
stopped
a
rather
shabby
shop
a
pitiful
sort
of
a
place
displaying
in
its
window
a
heterogeneous
conglomeration
of
cheap
odds
and
ends
ink
bottles
candy
pencils
cigarettes
pens
toys
writing
pads
marbles
and
a
multitude
of
other
small
wares
confronted
him
within
a
little
old
woman
stood
behind
the
counter
pottering
over
the
rearrangement
of
some
articles
on
the
shelves
my
word
said
jimmie
dale
softly
to
himself
you
would
believe
it
would
you
and
i
always
wondered
how
these
little
stores
managed
to
make
both
ends
meet
think
of
that
old
soul
making
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
dollars
from
a
layout
like
this
even
if
it
has
taken
her
a
lifetime
jimmie
dale
had
halted
nonchalantly
and
unconcernedly
by
the
curb
not
too
near
the
window
busied
apparently
in
an
effort
to
light
a
refractory
cigarette
and
then
about
to
enter
the
store
he
gazed
aimlessly
across
the
street
for
a
moment
instead
a
man
came
briskly
around
the
corner
from
sixth
avenue
opened
the
store
door
and
went
in
jimmie
dale
drew
back
a
little
and
turned
his
head
again
as
the
door
closed
and
a
sudden
quick
alert
and
startled
look
spread
over
his
face
the
man
who
had
entered
bent
over
the
counter
and
spoke
to
the
old
lady
she
seemed
to
listen
with
a
dawning
terror
creeping
over
her
features
and
then
her
hands
went
piteously
to
the
thin
hair
behind
her
ears
the
man
motioned
toward
a
door
at
the
rear
of
the
store
she
hesitated
then
came
out
from
behind
the
counter
and
swayed
a
little
as
though
her
limbs
would
not
support
her
weight
jimmie
dale
lips
thinned
i
afraid
he
muttered
slowly
i
afraid
that
i
too
late
even
and
then
as
she
came
to
the
door
and
turned
the
key
on
the
inside
pray
heaven
she
does
turn
the
light
out
or
somebody
might
think
i
was
trying
to
break
in
but
in
that
respect
jimmie
dale
fears
were
groundless
she
did
not
turn
out
either
of
the
gas
jets
that
lighted
the
little
shop
instead
in
a
faltering
reluctant
sort
of
manner
she
led
the
way
directly
through
the
door
in
the
rear
and
the
man
followed
her
the
shop
was
empty
and
jimmie
dale
was
standing
against
the
door
on
the
outside
his
position
was
perfectly
natural
a
hundred
would
have
noted
nothing
but
a
most
commonplace
occurrence
a
man
in
the
act
of
entering
a
store
and
if
he
appeared
to
fumble
and
have
trouble
with
the
latch
what
of
it
jimmie
dale
however
was
not
fumbling
hidden
by
his
back
that
was
turned
to
the
street
those
wonderful
fingers
of
his
in
whose
tips
seemed
embodied
and
concentrated
every
one
of
the
human
senses
were
working
quickly
surely
accurately
without
so
much
as
the
wasted
movement
of
a
single
muscle
a
faint
tinkle
and
the
key
within
fell
from
the
lock
to
the
floor
a
faint
click
and
the
bolt
of
the
lock
slipped
back
jimmie
dale
restored
the
skeleton
keys
and
a
little
steel
instrument
that
accompanied
them
to
his
pocket
and
quietly
opened
the
door
he
stepped
inside
picked
up
the
key
from
the
floor
inserted
it
in
the
lock
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
locked
it
again
to
guard
against
interruption
observed
jimmie
dale
a
little
quizzically
he
was
perhaps
thirty
seconds
behind
the
others
he
crossed
the
shop
noiselessly
cautiously
and
passed
through
the
door
at
the
rear
it
opened
into
a
short
passage
that
after
a
few
feet
gave
on
a
sort
of
corridor
at
right
angles
and
down
this
latter
facing
him
at
the
end
the
door
of
a
lighted
room
was
open
and
he
could
see
the
figure
of
the
man
who
had
entered
the
shop
back
turned
standing
on
the
threshold
voices
indistinct
came
to
him
the
corridor
itself
was
dark
and
jimmie
dale
satisfied
that
he
was
fairly
safe
from
observation
stole
softly
forward
he
passed
two
doors
on
his
left
and
the
curious
arrangement
of
the
building
that
had
puzzled
him
for
a
moment
became
clear
the
store
made
the
front
of
an
old
tenement
building
with
apartments
above
and
the
rear
of
the
store
was
a
sort
of
apartment
too
the
old
lady
living
quarters
step
by
step
testing
each
one
against
a
possible
creaking
of
the
floor
jimmie
dale
moved
forward
keeping
close
up
against
one
wall
the
man
passed
on
into
the
room
and
now
jimmie
dale
could
distinguish
every
word
that
was
being
spoken
and
crouched
up
in
the
dark
corridor
in
the
angle
of
the
wall
and
the
door
jamb
itself
could
see
plainly
enough
into
the
room
beyond
jimmie
dale
jaw
crept
out
a
little
a
young
man
gaunt
pale
wrapped
in
blankets
half
sat
half
reclined
in
an
invalid
chair
the
old
lady
on
her
knees
the
tears
streaming
down
her
face
had
her
arms
around
the
sick
man
neck
while
the
other
man
apparently
upset
at
the
scene
tugged
vigorously
at
long
gray
mustaches
sammy
sammy
sobbed
the
woman
piteously
say
you
did
do
it
sammy
say
you
did
do
it
look
here
matthews
said
the
man
with
the
gray
mustaches
gently
now
do
you
go
to
making
things
any
harder
i
got
to
do
my
duty
just
the
same
and
take
your
the
young
man
a
hectic
flush
beginning
to
burn
on
his
cheeks
gazed
wildly
from
one
to
the
other
what
what
is
it
he
cried
out
the
man
threw
back
his
coat
and
displayed
a
badge
on
his
vest
i
kline
of
the
secret
service
he
said
gravely
i
sorry
sammy
but
i
want
you
for
that
little
job
in
washington
at
the
bureau
before
you
left
on
sick
leave
sammy
matthews
struggled
away
from
his
mother
arms
pulled
himself
forward
in
his
chair
and
his
tongue
licked
dry
lips
what
what
job
he
whispered
thickly
you
know
do
you
the
other
answered
steadily
he
took
a
large
flat
pocketbook
from
his
pocket
opened
it
and
took
out
a
bill
he
held
this
before
the
sick
man
eyes
but
just
out
of
reach
one
finger
silently
indicating
the
lower
corner
matthews
stared
at
it
for
a
moment
and
the
hectic
flush
faded
to
a
grayish
pallor
and
a
queer
impotent
sound
gurgled
in
his
throat
i
see
you
recognise
it
said
the
other
quietly
it
open
and
shut
sammy
that
little
imperfection
in
the
plate
got
you
my
sammy
sammy
sobbed
the
woman
again
sammy
say
you
did
do
it
it
a
lie
said
matthews
hoarsely
it
a
lie
that
plate
was
condemned
in
the
bureau
for
that
imperfection
condemned
and
condemned
to
be
destroyed
corrected
the
other
without
raising
his
voice
there
a
little
difference
there
sammy
about
twenty
difference
in
the
federal
pen
but
it
was
destroyed
this
note
was
printed
from
it
by
one
of
the
slickest
gangs
of
counterfeiters
in
the
united
states
but
i
do
need
to
tell
you
that
i
guess
you
know
who
they
are
i
been
after
them
a
long
time
and
i
got
them
now
just
as
tight
as
i
got
you
instead
of
destroying
that
plate
you
stole
it
and
disposed
of
it
to
the
gang
how
much
did
they
give
you
matthews
face
seemed
to
hold
a
dumb
horror
and
his
fingers
picked
at
the
arms
of
the
chair
his
mother
had
moved
from
beside
him
now
and
both
her
hands
were
patting
at
the
man
sleeve
in
a
pitiful
way
while
again
and
again
she
tried
to
speak
but
no
words
would
come
it
a
lie
said
matthews
again
in
a
colourless
mechanical
way
the
man
glanced
at
matthews
as
he
put
the
note
back
into
his
pocket
seemed
to
choke
a
little
shook
his
head
and
all
trace
of
the
official
sternness
that
had
crept
into
his
voice
disappeared
it
no
good
he
said
in
a
low
tone
do
do
that
matthews
i
got
to
do
my
he
leaned
a
little
toward
the
chair
it
dead
to
rights
sammy
you
might
as
well
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
it
was
up
to
you
and
al
gregor
to
see
that
the
plate
was
destroyed
it
destroyed
instead
it
shows
up
in
the
hands
of
a
gang
of
counterfeiters
that
i
been
watching
for
months
furthermore
i
got
the
plate
itself
and
finally
though
i
have
placed
him
under
arrest
yet
for
fear
you
might
hear
of
it
before
i
wanted
you
to
and
make
a
i
got
al
gregor
where
i
can
put
my
hands
on
him
and
i
got
his
confession
that
you
and
he
worked
the
game
between
you
to
get
that
plate
out
of
the
bureau
and
dispose
of
it
to
the
oh
my
god
it
came
in
a
wild
cry
from
the
sick
man
and
in
a
desperate
lurching
way
he
struggled
up
to
his
feet
al
gregor
said
that
then
then
i
done
he
clutched
at
his
temples
but
it
not
true
it
not
true
if
the
plate
was
stolen
and
it
must
have
been
stolen
or
that
note
would
have
been
found
it
was
al
gregor
who
stole
it
i
did
i
tell
you
i
knew
nothing
of
it
except
that
he
and
i
were
responsible
for
it
and
and
i
left
it
to
him
that
the
only
way
i
to
blame
he
caught
and
he
trying
to
get
out
of
it
with
a
light
sentence
by
pretending
to
turn
state
evidence
but
but
i
fight
him
he
ca
prove
it
it
only
his
word
against
mine
and
the
other
shook
his
head
again
it
no
good
sammy
he
said
a
touch
of
sternness
back
in
his
tones
again
i
told
you
it
was
open
and
shut
it
not
only
al
gregor
one
of
the
gang
got
weak
knees
when
i
got
him
where
i
wanted
him
the
other
night
and
he
swears
that
you
are
the
one
who
delivered
the
plate
to
them
between
him
and
gregor
and
what
i
know
myself
i
got
evidence
enough
for
any
jury
against
every
one
of
the
rest
of
horror
fear
helplessness
seemed
to
mingle
in
the
sick
man
staring
eyes
and
he
swayed
unsteadily
upon
his
feet
i
innocent
he
screamed
out
but
i
caught
i
caught
in
a
net
and
i
ca
get
out
they
lied
to
you
but
no
one
will
believe
it
any
more
than
you
do
and
and
it
means
twenty
years
for
me
oh
god
twenty
years
and
his
hands
went
wriggling
to
his
temples
again
and
he
toppled
back
in
a
faint
into
the
chair
you
killed
him
you
killed
my
boy
the
old
lady
shrieked
out
piteously
and
flung
herself
toward
the
senseless
figure
the
man
jumped
for
the
table
across
the
room
on
which
was
a
row
of
bottles
snatched
one
up
drew
the
cork
smelled
it
and
ran
back
with
the
bottle
he
poured
a
little
of
the
contents
into
his
cupped
hand
held
it
under
young
matthews
nostrils
and
pushed
the
bottle
into
matthews
hands
bathe
his
forehead
with
this
matthews
he
directed
reassuringly
he
be
all
right
again
in
a
moment
there
see
he
coming
around
there
was
a
long
fluttering
sigh
and
matthews
opened
his
eyes
then
a
moment
silence
and
then
he
spoke
with
an
effort
with
long
pauses
between
the
words
am
i
to
go
now
the
words
seemed
to
ring
absolute
terror
in
the
old
lady
ears
she
turned
and
dropped
to
her
knees
on
the
floor
mr
kline
kline
she
sobbed
out
oh
for
god
love
do
take
him
let
him
off
let
him
go
he
my
boy
all
i
got
you
got
a
mother
have
you
you
know
the
tears
were
streaming
down
the
sweet
old
face
again
oh
wo
you
for
god
dear
name
wo
you
let
him
go
wo
stop
the
man
cried
huskily
he
was
mopping
at
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
i
thought
i
was
i
ought
to
be
but
i
guess
i
not
but
i
got
to
do
my
duty
you
only
making
it
worse
for
sammy
there
as
well
as
her
arms
were
around
his
knees
now
clinging
there
why
ca
you
let
him
off
she
pleaded
hysterically
why
you
why
ca
you
nobody
would
know
and
i
do
anything
i
pay
anything
anything
i
give
you
ten
fifteen
thousand
dollars
my
poor
woman
he
said
kindly
placing
his
hand
on
her
head
you
are
talking
wildly
apart
altogether
from
the
question
of
duty
even
if
i
succeeded
in
hushing
the
matter
up
i
would
probably
at
least
be
suspected
and
certainly
discharged
and
i
have
a
family
to
support
and
if
i
were
caught
i
get
ten
years
in
the
federal
prison
for
it
sorry
for
this
i
believe
it
your
boy
first
offence
and
if
i
could
let
him
off
i
but
you
can
you
can
she
burst
out
rocking
on
her
knees
clinging
tighter
still
to
him
as
though
in
a
paroxysm
of
fear
that
he
might
somehow
elude
her
it
will
kill
him
it
will
kill
my
boy
and
you
can
save
him
and
even
if
they
discharged
you
what
would
that
mean
against
my
boy
life
you
would
suffer
your
family
would
suffer
i
i
take
care
of
that
perhaps
i
could
raise
a
little
more
than
fifteen
thousand
but
oh
have
pity
have
mercy
do
take
him
away
the
man
stared
at
her
a
moment
stared
at
the
white
face
on
the
reclining
chair
and
passed
his
hand
heavily
across
his
eyes
you
will
you
will
it
came
in
a
great
surging
cry
of
joy
from
the
old
lady
you
will
oh
thank
god
thank
god
i
can
see
it
in
your
face
i
i
guess
i
soft
he
said
huskily
and
stooped
and
raised
matthews
to
her
feet
do
cry
any
more
it
be
all
right
it
be
all
right
i
i
fix
it
up
somehow
i
have
made
any
arrests
yet
and
well
i
take
my
chances
i
get
the
plate
and
turn
it
over
to
you
only
only
it
got
to
be
destroyed
in
my
yes
yes
she
cried
trying
to
smile
through
her
tears
and
then
she
flung
her
arms
around
her
son
neck
again
and
when
you
come
i
be
ready
with
the
money
to
do
my
share
too
and
but
sammy
matthews
shook
his
head
you
wrong
both
of
you
he
said
weakly
you
a
white
man
kline
but
destroying
that
plate
wo
save
me
the
minute
a
single
note
printed
from
it
shows
up
they
know
back
there
in
washington
that
the
plate
was
stolen
and
no
you
safe
enough
there
the
other
interposed
heavily
knowing
what
was
up
you
do
think
i
give
the
gang
a
chance
to
get
them
into
circulation
do
you
i
got
them
all
when
i
got
the
plate
and
he
smiled
a
little
anxiously
i
bring
them
here
to
be
destroyed
with
the
plate
it
would
finish
me
now
as
well
as
you
if
one
of
them
ever
showed
up
say
he
said
suddenly
with
a
catch
in
his
breath
i
i
do
think
i
know
what
i
matthews
reached
out
her
hands
to
him
what
can
i
say
to
you
she
said
brokenly
what
jimmie
dale
drew
back
along
the
wall
a
little
way
from
the
door
he
quickened
his
pace
still
moving
however
with
extreme
caution
they
were
still
talking
behind
him
as
he
turned
from
the
corridor
into
the
passageway
leading
to
the
store
and
from
there
into
the
store
itself
and
then
suddenly
in
spite
of
caution
his
foot
slipped
on
the
bare
floor
it
was
not
much
just
enough
to
cause
his
other
foot
poised
tentatively
in
air
to
come
heavily
down
and
a
loud
and
complaining
creak
echoed
from
the
floor
jimmie
dale
jaws
snapped
like
a
steel
trap
from
down
the
corridor
came
a
sudden
excited
exclamation
in
the
little
old
lady
voice
and
then
her
steps
sounded
running
toward
the
store
in
the
fraction
of
a
second
jimmie
dale
was
at
the
front
door
clumsy
blundering
fool
he
whispered
fiercely
to
himself
as
he
turned
the
key
opened
the
door
noiselessly
until
it
was
just
ajar
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
again
leaving
the
bolt
protruding
out
one
step
backward
and
he
was
rapping
on
the
counter
with
his
knuckles
anybody
here
he
called
out
loudly
is
any
oh
as
matthews
appeared
in
the
back
doorway
a
package
of
cigarettes
she
stared
at
him
a
little
frightened
her
eyes
red
and
swollen
with
recent
crying
how
how
did
you
get
in
here
she
asked
tremendously
i
beg
your
pardon
inquired
jimmie
dale
in
polite
surprise
i
i
locked
the
door
i
sure
i
did
she
said
more
to
herself
than
to
jimmie
dale
and
hurried
across
the
floor
to
the
door
as
she
spoke
jimmie
dale
still
politely
curious
turned
to
watch
her
for
a
moment
bewilderment
and
a
puzzled
look
were
in
her
face
and
then
a
sort
of
surprised
relief
i
must
have
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
without
shutting
the
door
tight
she
explained
for
i
knew
i
turned
the
jimmie
dale
bent
forward
to
examine
the
lock
and
nodded
yes
he
agreed
with
a
smile
i
should
say
then
gravely
courteous
i
sorry
to
have
it
is
nothing
she
answered
and
evidently
anxious
to
be
rid
of
him
moved
quickly
around
behind
the
counter
what
kind
of
cigarettes
do
you
want
egyptians
any
kind
said
jimmie
dale
laying
a
bill
on
the
counter
he
pocketed
the
cigarettes
and
his
change
and
turned
to
the
door
he
said
pleasantly
and
went
out
jimmie
dale
smiled
a
little
curiously
a
little
tolerantly
as
he
started
along
the
street
he
heard
the
door
of
the
little
shop
close
with
a
sort
of
supercareful
bang
the
key
turned
and
the
latch
rattle
to
try
the
door
the
little
old
lady
was
bent
on
making
no
mistake
a
second
time
and
then
the
smile
left
jimmie
dale
lips
his
face
grew
strained
and
serious
and
he
broke
into
a
run
down
the
block
to
sixth
avenue
here
he
paused
for
an
instant
there
was
the
elevated
the
surface
cars
which
would
be
the
quicker
he
looked
up
the
avenue
there
was
no
train
coming
the
nearest
surface
car
was
blocks
away
he
bit
his
lips
in
vexation
and
then
with
a
jump
he
was
across
the
street
and
hailing
a
passing
taxicab
that
his
eyes
had
just
lighted
on
got
a
fare
called
jimmie
dale
no
sir
answered
the
chauffeur
bumping
his
car
to
an
abrupt
halt
good
jimmie
dale
ran
alongside
and
yanked
the
door
open
do
you
know
where
the
palace
saloon
on
the
bowery
is
yes
sir
replied
the
man
jimmie
dale
held
a
bank
note
up
before
the
chauffeur
eyes
earn
that
in
four
minutes
then
he
snapped
and
sprang
into
the
cab
the
taxicab
swerved
around
on
little
better
than
two
wheels
started
on
a
mad
dash
down
the
avenue
and
jimmie
dale
braced
himself
grimly
in
his
seat
the
cab
swerved
again
tore
across
waverly
place
circuited
washington
square
crossed
broadway
and
whirled
finally
into
the
upper
end
of
the
bowery
jimmie
dale
spoke
once
to
himself
plaintively
it
too
bad
i
ca
let
old
carruthers
in
on
this
for
a
scoop
with
his
precious
morning
but
if
i
get
out
of
it
alive
myself
do
well
wonder
if
the
day
ever
come
when
he
finds
out
that
his
very
dear
friend
and
old
college
pal
jimmie
dale
is
the
gray
seal
that
turned
himself
inside
out
for
about
four
years
now
to
catch
and
that
he
trade
his
soul
with
the
devil
any
time
to
lay
hands
on
good
old
carruthers
most
puzzling
bewildering
delightful
crook
in
the
annals
of
crime
am
i
the
cab
drew
up
at
the
curb
jimmie
dale
sprang
out
shoved
the
bill
into
the
chauffeur
hand
stepped
quickly
across
the
sidewalk
and
pushed
his
way
through
the
swinging
doors
of
the
palace
saloon
inside
leisurely
and
nonchalantly
he
walked
down
past
the
length
of
the
bar
to
a
door
at
the
rear
this
opened
into
a
passageway
that
led
to
the
side
entrance
of
the
saloon
on
the
cross
street
jimmie
dale
emerged
from
the
side
entrance
crossed
the
street
retraced
his
steps
to
the
bowery
crossed
over
and
walked
rapidly
down
that
thoroughfare
for
two
blocks
here
he
turned
east
into
the
cross
street
and
here
once
more
his
pace
became
leisurely
and
unhurried
it
a
strange
coincidence
though
possibly
a
very
happy
one
said
jimmie
dale
as
he
walked
along
that
it
should
be
on
the
same
street
as
the
sanctuary
ah
this
ought
to
be
the
place
an
alleyway
corresponding
to
the
one
that
flanked
the
tenement
where
as
larry
the
bat
he
had
paid
room
rent
as
a
tenant
for
several
years
in
fact
the
alleyway
next
above
it
and
but
a
short
block
away
intersected
the
street
narrow
black
and
uninviting
jimmie
dale
as
he
passed
peered
down
its
length
no
light
that
good

jimmie
dale
mind
with
that
curious
faculty
of
his
was
subconsciously
repeating
snatches
from
her
letter
word
for
word
even
as
he
noted
the
dimly
lighted
untidy
and
disorderly
interior
of
what
from
strings
of
leather
slippers
that
decorated
the
cellarlike
entrance
was
evidently
a
cheap
and
shoddy
shoe
store
in
the
basement
of
the
building
the
building
itself
was
rickety
and
three
stories
high
and
given
over
undoubtedly
to
gregarious
foreigners
of
the
poorer
class
a
rabbit
burrow
as
it
were
having
a
multitude
of
roomers
and
lodgers
there
was
nothing
ominous
or
even
secretive
about
it
up
the
short
flight
of
steps
to
the
entrance
even
the
door
hung
carelessly
half
open
jimmie
dale
slouch
hat
was
pulled
a
little
farther
down
over
his
eyes
as
he
mounted
the
steps
and
entered
the
hallway
he
listened
a
moment
a
sort
of
subdued
querulous
hubbub
seemed
to
hum
through
the
place
as
voices
men
women
and
children
echoing
out
from
their
various
rooms
above
mingled
together
and
floated
down
the
stairways
in
a
discordant
medley
jimmie
dale
stepped
lightly
down
the
length
of
the
hall
and
listened
again
this
time
intently
with
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
of
the
door
that
made
the
end
of
the
passage
there
was
not
a
sound
from
within
he
tried
the
door
smiled
a
little
as
he
reached
for
his
keys
worked
over
the
lock
and
straightened
up
suddenly
as
his
ear
caught
a
descending
step
on
the
stairs
it
was
two
flights
up
however
and
the
door
was
unlocked
now
jimmie
dale
opened
it
and
like
a
shadow
slipped
inside
and
as
he
locked
the
door
behind
him
smiled
once
more
the
door
lock
was
but
a
paltry
makeshift
at
best
but
inside
his
fingers
had
touched
a
massive
steel
bolt
that
when
shot
home
would
yield
when
the
door
itself
yielded
and
not
before
without
moving
the
bolt
he
turned
and
his
flashlight
for
a
moment
swept
the
room
not
much
like
the
way
they
describe
this
sort
of
place
in
storybooks
murmured
jimmie
dale
capriciously
but
i
get
the
idea
russian
jew
downstairs
makes
a
bluff
at
using
it
for
a
again
the
flashlight
made
a
circuit
here
there
and
everywhere
seemingly
without
any
attempt
at
order
were
piles
of
wooden
shipping
cases
only
the
centre
of
the
room
was
clear
and
empty
that
and
a
vacant
space
against
the
wall
by
the
window
jimmie
dale
moving
without
sound
went
to
the
window
there
was
a
shade
on
it
and
it
was
pulled
down
he
reached
up
underneath
it
felt
for
the
window
fastening
and
unlocked
it
then
cautiously
tested
the
window
itself
by
lifting
it
an
inch
or
two
it
slid
easily
in
its
grooves
he
stood
then
for
a
moment
hardfaced
a
frown
gathering
his
forehead
into
heavy
furrows
as
the
flashlight
ray
again
and
again
darted
hither
and
thither
there
was
nothing
absolutely
nothing
in
the
room
but
wooden
packing
cases
he
lifted
the
cover
of
the
one
nearest
to
him
and
looked
inside
it
was
quite
empty
except
for
some
pieces
of
heavy
cord
and
a
few
cardboard
shoe
boxes
that
in
turn
were
empty
too
it
here
of
course
said
jimmie
dale
thoughtfully
to
himself
clever
work
too
but
i
ca
move
half
a
hundred
packing
cases
without
that
chap
below
hearing
me
and
i
ca
do
it
in
ten
minutes
either
which
i
imagine
is
the
outside
limit
of
time
fortunately
though
these
cases
are
not
without
their
compensation
a
dozen
men
could
hide
he
began
to
move
about
the
room
and
now
he
stooped
before
one
pile
of
boxes
and
then
another
curiously
attempting
to
lift
up
the
entire
pile
from
the
bottom
some
he
could
not
move
others
by
exerting
all
his
strength
gave
a
little
and
then
finally
over
in
one
corner
he
found
a
pile
that
appeared
to
answer
his
purpose
these
are
certainly
empty
he
muttered
there
was
just
room
to
squeeze
through
between
them
and
the
next
stack
of
cases
alongside
but
once
through
by
the
simple
expedient
of
moving
the
cases
out
a
little
to
take
advantage
of
the
angle
made
by
the
corner
of
the
room
he
obtained
ample
space
to
stand
comfortably
upright
against
the
wall
but
jimmie
dale
was
not
satisfied
yet
could
he
see
out
into
the
room
he
experimented
with
his
flashlight
and
carefully
shifted
the
screen
of
cases
before
him
a
little
to
one
side
and
yet
still
he
was
not
satisfied
with
a
sort
of
ironical
droop
at
the
corners
of
his
lips
as
though
suddenly
there
had
flashed
upon
him
the
inspiration
that
fathered
one
of
those
whimsical
ideas
and
fancies
that
were
so
essentially
a
characteristic
of
jimmie
dale
he
came
out
from
behind
the
cases
went
across
the
room
to
the
case
he
had
opened
when
he
first
entered
took
out
the
cord
and
the
cover
of
one
of
the
cardboard
shoe
boxes
and
with
these
returned
to
his
hiding
place
once
more
the
sounds
from
the
upper
stories
of
the
tenement
now
reached
him
hardly
at
all
but
from
below
directly
under
his
feet
almost
he
could
hear
some
one
the
proprietor
of
the
shoe
store
probably
walking
about
tense
every
faculty
now
on
the
alert
his
head
turned
in
a
strained
attentive
attitude
jimmie
dale
threw
on
the
flashlight
tiny
switch
took
that
intimate
and
thin
metal
case
from
his
pocket
extracted
a
gray
paper
seal
with
the
little
tweezers
moistened
the
adhesive
side
and
stuck
it
in
the
centre
of
the
white
cover
then
tore
the
edges
of
the
cardboard
down
until
the
whole
was
just
small
enough
to
slip
into
his
pocket
through
the
cardboard
he
looped
a
piece
of
cord
placard
fashion
and
with
his
pencil
printed
the
four
words
with
the
compliments
of
above
the
gray
seal
he
surveyed
the
result
with
a
grim
mirthless
chuckle
and
put
the
piece
of
cardboard
in
his
pocket
i
taking
the
longest
chances
i
ever
took
in
my
life
said
jimmie
dale
very
seriously
to
himself
as
his
fingers
twisted
and
doubled
and
tied
the
remaining
pieces
of
cord
together
and
finally
fashioned
a
running
noose
in
one
end
i
do
the
cord
and
the
flashlight
went
into
his
pocket
the
room
was
in
darkness
the
black
mask
was
whipped
from
his
breast
pocket
and
adjusted
to
his
face
and
his
automatic
was
in
his
hand
came
the
creak
of
a
footstep
as
though
on
a
ladder
exactly
below
him
another
and
another
receding
curiously
in
its
direction
yet
at
the
same
time
growing
louder
in
sound
as
if
nearer
the
floor
then
a
crack
of
light
showed
in
the
floor
in
the
centre
of
the
room
this
held
for
an
instant
then
expanded
suddenly
into
a
great
luminous
square
and
through
a
trapdoor
opened
wide
now
a
man
head
appeared
jimmie
dale
eyes
fixed
through
the
space
between
the
piles
of
cases
narrowed
there
was
indeed
little
doubt
but
that
the
proprietor
below
was
an
accomplice
the
store
served
a
most
convenient
purpose
in
every
respect
as
a
secret
means
of
entry
into
the
room
as
a
sort
of
guarantee
of
innocence
for
the
room
itself
why
not
to
the
superficial
observer
to
the
man
who
might
by
some
chance
blunder
into
the
room
it
was
but
an
adjunct
of
the
store
itself
the
man
in
the
paused
with
his
shoulders
above
the
floor
looked
around
listened
then
drew
himself
up
walked
across
the
floor
and
shot
the
heavy
bolt
on
the
door
that
led
into
the
hallway
of
the
house
he
returned
then
to
the
trapdoor
bent
over
it
and
whistled
softly
two
more
men
in
answer
to
the
summons
came
up
into
the
room
the
cap
be
along
in
a
minute
one
of
them
said
turn
on
the
a
switch
clicked
flooding
the
room
with
sudden
brilliancy
from
half
a
dozen
electric
bulbs
too
many
grunted
the
same
voice
again
we
ai
working
turn
out
half
of
the
sudden
transition
from
the
darkness
for
a
moment
dazzled
jimmie
dale
eyes
but
the
next
moment
he
was
searching
the
faces
of
the
three
men
there
were
few
crooks
few
denizens
of
the
crime
world
below
the
now
obsolete
but
still
famous
dead
line
that
as
larry
the
bat
he
did
not
know
at
least
by
sight
moulton
whitie
burns
and
marty
dean
confided
jimmie
dale
softly
to
himself
and
i
do
know
of
any
worse
except
the
cap
and
gun
fighters
every
one
of
them
too
nice
odds
to
say
nothing
of
here
the
cap
now
announced
one
of
the
three
hello
cap
you
raise
the
mustache
jimmie
dale
eyes
shifted
to
the
trapdoor
and
into
them
crept
a
contemptuous
and
sardonic
smile
the
man
who
was
coming
up
now
and
hoisting
himself
to
the
floor
was
the
man
who
half
an
hour
before
had
threatened
young
sammy
matthews
with
arrest
the
cap
alias
bert
malone
alias
a
score
of
other
names
closed
the
trapdoor
after
him
pulled
off
his
mustache
and
gray
wig
tucked
them
in
his
pocket
and
faced
his
companions
brusquely
never
mind
about
the
mustache
he
said
curtly
get
busy
the
lot
of
you
stir
around
and
get
the
works
out
what
for
inquired
whitie
burns
a
sharp
little
man
we
got
enough
of
the
old
stuff
on
hand
now
and
that
bum
break
gregor
made
when
he
pinched
the
cracked
plate
put
the
finish
on
that
say
cap
close
your
face
whitie
and
get
the
works
out
malone
cut
in
shortly
we
only
got
the
whole
night
ahead
of
us
but
we
need
it
all
we
going
to
run
the
queer
off
that
cracked
one
of
the
others
marty
dean
this
time
a
certain
brutal
aggressiveness
in
both
features
and
physique
edged
forward
say
what
the
lay
he
demanded
a
joke
we
printed
one
fiver
off
that
plate
and
then
we
knew
enough
to
quit
with
that
crack
along
the
corner
you
could
pass
on
a
blind
man
and
gregor
saying
he
thought
we
could
patch
the
plate
up
enough
to
get
by
with
gives
me
a
pain
he
got
jingles
in
his
dome
factory
run
them
fivers
eh
say
are
you
cracked
too
aw
forget
it
observed
malone
caustically
who
running
this
gang
then
with
a
malicious
grin
i
got
a
customer
for
those
fivers
fifteen
thousand
dollars
for
all
we
can
turn
out
see
the
others
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
incredulity
and
greed
mingling
in
a
curious
look
on
their
faces
then
whitie
burns
spoke
circling
his
lips
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
d
mean
it
cap
honest
what
the
lay
how
you
work
it
malone
unbending
with
the
sensation
he
had
created
grinned
again
easy
enough
he
said
offhandedly
it
was
like
falling
off
a
log
gregor
said
did
he
that
the
only
way
he
had
been
able
to
get
his
claws
on
that
plate
was
on
account
of
young
matthews
going
away
sick
eh
well
the
old
matthews
woman
his
mother
has
got
money
about
fifteen
thousand
i
guess
she
ai
got
any
more
than
that
or
i
have
raised
the
ante
aw
it
was
easy
she
threw
it
at
me
i
framed
one
up
on
them
that
all
i
kline
of
the
secret
service
see
i
do
suppose
they
ever
seen
him
though
they
know
his
name
fast
enough
but
i
made
up
something
like
him
i
showed
them
where
i
had
a
case
against
sammy
for
pinching
the
plate
that
was
strong
enough
to
put
a
hundred
innocent
men
behind
the
bars
of
course
he
knew
well
enough
he
was
innocent
but
he
could
see
the
twenty
years
i
showed
him
with
both
eyes
say
he
mussed
all
over
the
place
and
went
and
fainted
like
a
girl
and
then
the
old
woman
came
across
with
an
offer
of
fifteen
thousand
for
the
plate
and
corrupted
malone
cunning
vicious
face
now
that
the
softening
effects
of
the
gray
hair
and
mustache
were
gone
seemed
accentuated
diabolically
by
the
grin
broadening
into
a
laugh
as
he
guffawed
marty
dean
hand
swung
with
a
bang
to
malone
shoulder
say
cap
say
you
all
right
he
exclaimed
excitedly
the
boy
but
what
the
good
of
running
anything
off
the
plate
before
turning
it
over
to
the
stuff
no
good
to
you
got
a
wooden
nut
with
sawdust
for
brains
said
malone
sarcastically
if
he
thought
the
gang
of
counterfeiters
that
was
supposed
to
have
bought
the
plate
from
him
had
run
off
only
one
fiver
and
then
stopped
because
they
say
it
would
get
by
and
were
going
to
run
any
more
and
just
destroy
the
plate
like
it
was
supposed
to
have
been
destroyed
to
begin
with
and
it
all
end
up
with
no
one
the
wiser
where
d
think
we
have
banked
that
fifteen
thousand
i
told
him
i
had
the
whole
run
confiscated
and
that
the
queer
went
with
the
plate
so
we
just
make
that
little
run
that
why
i
sent
word
around
to
you
this
by
the
jumping
ejaculated
whitie
burns
heavy
with
admiration
you
got
a
head
on
you
cap
it
a
good
thing
for
some
of
you
that
i
have
returned
malone
complacently
but
do
stand
jawing
all
night
go
on
now
get
busy
there
was
no
surprise
in
jimmie
dale
face
he
had
chosen
his
position
behind
a
pile
of
cases
that
he
had
been
extremely
careful
as
a
man
is
careful
when
his
life
hangs
in
the
balance
to
assure
himself
were
empty
none
of
the
four
came
near
or
touched
the
pile
behind
which
he
stood
but
here
and
there
about
the
room
they
pulled
this
one
and
that
one
out
from
various
stacks
in
scarcely
more
than
a
moment
the
room
was
completely
transformed
it
was
no
longer
a
storeroom
for
surplus
stock
for
the
storage
of
bulky
and
empty
packing
cases
from
the
cases
the
men
had
picked
out
like
a
touch
of
magic
appeared
a
veritable
printing
plant
an
elaborate
engraver
outfit
a
highly
efficient
press
rapidly
being
assembled
by
whitie
burns
an
electric
dryer
inks
a
pile
of
white
paper
a
cutter
and
a
score
of
other
appurtenances
yes
said
jimmie
dale
very
gently
to
himself
yes
quite
so
but
the
plate
ah
malone
was
taking
it
out
from
the
middle
of
a
bundle
of
old
newspapers
loosely
tied
together
that
he
had
lifted
from
one
of
the
cases
jimmie
dale
eyes
fastened
on
it
and
from
that
instant
never
left
it
a
minute
passed
two
three
of
them
the
four
men
were
silently
busy
about
the
room
malone
was
carefully
cleaning
the
plate
they
will
raid
look
out
for
kline
he
is
the
sharpest
man
in
the
united
state
secret
service
the
warning
in
her
letter
was
running
through
jimmie
dale
mind
kline
the
real
kline
was
going
to
raid
the
place
when
at
what
time
it
must
be
nearly
eleven
already
and
it
came
sudden
quick
as
the
crack
of
doom
a
terrific
crash
against
the
bolted
door
but
the
door
undoubtedly
to
the
surprise
of
those
without
held
fast
thanks
to
the
bolt
the
four
men
seemed
for
an
instant
turned
to
statues
came
another
crash
against
the
door
and
a
sharp
imperative
order
to
those
within
to
open
it
and
surrender
we
pinched
beat
it
whispered
whitie
burns
wildly
and
dashed
for
the
trapdoor
like
a
rat
for
its
hole
marty
dean
followed
malone
farther
away
dropped
the
plate
on
the
floor
and
rushed
with
moulton
beside
him
after
the
others
but
he
never
reached
the
trapdoor
over
the
crashing
blows
raining
now
in
quick
succession
on
the
door
of
the
room
over
a
startled
commotion
as
lodgers
roomers
and
tenants
on
the
floor
above
awoke
into
frightened
activity
with
shouts
and
cries
came
the
louder
crash
of
a
pile
of
packing
boxes
hurled
to
the
floor
and
over
them
vaulting
those
scattered
in
his
way
jimmie
dale
sprang
at
malone
the
man
reeled
back
with
a
cry
moulton
dashed
through
the
trapdoor
and
disappeared
the
short
ugly
barrel
of
jimmie
automatic
was
between
malone
eyes
you
make
a
move
said
jimmie
dale
in
a
low
sibilant
way
and
i
drop
you
where
you
stand
put
your
hands
behind
your
back
palms
together
malone
dazed
cowed
obeyed
a
panel
of
the
door
split
and
rent
down
its
length
the
hinges
were
sagging
jimmie
dale
worked
like
lightning
the
cord
with
the
slip
noose
from
his
pocket
went
around
wrists
jerked
tight
and
knotted
the
placard
his
lips
grim
with
no
sign
of
humour
jimmie
dale
dangled
around
the
man
neck
an
introduction
for
you
to
kline
out
there
that
you
seem
so
fond
of
gritted
jimmie
dale
then
working
as
he
talked
i
got
no
time
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
you
pitiful
hound
he
snatched
up
the
plate
from
the
floor
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
twenty
years
i
think
you
said
did
you
his
hand
shot
into
malone
and
extracted
the
note
if
you
can
open
this
with
your
toes
maybe
you
can
get
a
way
he
wrenched
the
trapdoor
over
and
slammed
it
shut
malone
and
he
leaped
for
the
window
the
door
tottered
inward
from
the
top
ripping
tearing
smashing
hinges
panels
and
jamb
jimmie
dale
got
a
blurred
vision
of
brass
buttons
blue
coats
and
helmets
and
in
the
forefront
of
a
stocky
man
in
plain
clothes
jimmie
dale
threw
up
the
window
swung
out
as
with
a
rush
the
officers
burst
through
into
the
room
and
a
revolver
bullet
hummed
viciously
past
his
ear
and
dropped
to
the
ground
into
encircling
arms
ah
no
you
do
my
bucko
snapped
a
hoarse
voice
in
his
ear
keep
quiet
now
or
i
crack
your
bean
understand
but
the
officer
too
heavy
to
be
muscular
was
no
match
for
jimmie
dale
who
even
as
he
had
dropped
from
the
sill
had
caught
sight
of
the
lurking
form
below
and
now
with
a
quick
sudden
lithe
movement
he
wriggled
loose
his
fist
from
a
jab
smashed
upon
the
point
of
the
other
jaw
sending
the
man
staggering
backward
and
jimmie
dale
ran
a
crowd
was
already
collecting
at
the
mouth
of
the
alleyway
mostly
occupants
of
the
house
itself
and
into
these
scattering
them
in
all
directions
eluding
dexterously
another
officer
who
made
a
grab
for
him
jimmie
dale
charged
at
top
speed
burst
through
and
headed
down
the
street
running
like
a
deer
yells
went
up
a
revolver
spat
venomously
behind
him
came
the
shrill
of
the
police
whistle
and
heavy
boots
pounding
the
pavement
in
pursuit
down
the
block
jimmie
dale
raced
the
yells
augmented
in
his
rear
another
shot
and
this
time
he
heard
the
bullet
buzz
and
then
he
swerved
into
the
next
alleyway
that
flanked
the
sanctuary
he
had
perhaps
a
ten
yards
lead
just
a
little
more
than
the
distance
from
the
street
to
the
side
door
of
the
sanctuary
that
opened
on
the
alleyway
and
as
he
ran
now
his
fingers
tore
at
his
clothing
loosening
his
tie
unbuttoning
coat
vest
collar
shirt
and
undershirt
he
leaped
at
the
door
swung
it
open
flung
himself
inside
and
then
sacrificing
speed
to
silence
went
up
the
stairs
like
a
cat
cramming
his
mask
now
into
his
pocket
his
room
was
on
the
first
landing
in
an
instant
he
had
unlocked
the
door
entered
and
locked
it
again
behind
him
from
outside
an
excited
street
urchin
voice
shrilled
up
to
him
he
went
in
that
door
i
seen
him
the
police
whistle
chirped
again
and
then
an
authoritative
voice
get
around
and
watch
the
saloon
back
of
this
heeney
there
a
way
out
through
there
from
this
jimmie
dale
divested
of
every
stitch
of
clothing
that
he
had
worn
pulled
a
disreputable
collarless
flannel
shirt
over
his
head
pulled
on
a
dirty
and
patched
pair
of
trousers
and
slipped
into
a
threadbare
and
filthy
coat
jimmie
dale
was
working
against
seconds
they
were
at
the
lower
door
now
he
lifted
the
oilcloth
in
the
corner
of
the
room
lifted
up
the
loose
piece
of
the
flooring
shoved
his
discarded
garments
inside
and
from
a
little
box
that
was
there
smeared
the
hollow
of
his
hand
with
some
black
substance
possessed
himself
of
two
little
articles
replaced
the
flooring
replaced
the
oilcloth
and
in
bare
feet
stole
across
the
room
to
the
door
against
the
door
without
a
sound
jimmie
dale
placed
a
chair
and
on
the
chair
seat
he
laid
the
two
little
articles
he
had
been
carrying
in
his
hand
it
was
intensely
black
in
the
room
but
jimmie
dale
needed
no
light
here
from
under
the
bed
he
pulled
out
a
pair
of
woolen
socks
and
a
pair
of
congress
boots
both
as
disreputable
as
the
rest
of
his
attire
put
them
on
and
very
quietly
softly
cautiously
stretched
himself
out
on
the
bed
the
officers
were
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
a
voice
barked
out
stand
guard
on
this
landing
peters
higgins
you
take
the
one
above
we
start
from
the
top
of
the
house
and
work
down
allow
no
one
to
pass
yes
sir
very
good
kline
was
the
response
kline
the
sharpest
man
in
the
united
states
secret
service
she
had
said
jimmie
dale
lips
set
i
glad
i
had
no
shave
this
morning
said
jimmie
dale
grimly
to
himself
his
fingers
were
working
with
the
black
substance
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
the
long
slim
tapering
fingers
the
shapely
hands
grew
unkempt
and
grimy
black
beneath
the
finger
nails
and
a
little
too
played
its
part
on
the
day
growth
of
beard
a
little
around
the
throat
and
at
the
nape
of
the
neck
a
little
across
the
forehead
to
meet
the
locks
of
straggling
and
disordered
hair
jimmie
dale
wiped
the
residue
from
the
hollow
of
his
hand
on
the
knee
of
his
trousers
and
lay
still
an
officer
paced
outside
upstairs
doors
opened
and
closed
gruff
harsh
tones
in
commands
echoed
through
the
house
the
search
party
descended
to
the
second
floor
and
again
the
same
sounds
were
repeated
and
then
thumping
down
the
creaking
stairs
they
stopped
before
jimmie
room
some
one
tried
the
door
and
finding
it
locked
rattled
it
violently
open
the
door
it
was
kline
voice
jimmie
dale
eyes
were
closed
and
he
was
breathing
regularly
though
just
a
little
slower
than
in
natural
respiration
break
it
down
ordered
kline
tersely
there
was
a
rush
at
it
and
it
gave
it
surged
inward
knocked
against
the
chair
upset
the
latter
something
tinkled
to
the
floor
and
four
officers
with
kline
at
their
head
jumped
into
the
room
jimmie
dale
never
moved
a
flashlight
played
around
the
room
and
focused
upon
him
and
then
he
was
shaken
roughly
only
to
fall
inertly
back
on
the
bed
again
i
guess
this
is
all
right
kline
said
one
of
the
officers
larry
the
bat
and
he
doped
to
the
eyes
there
the
stuff
on
the
floor
we
knocked
off
the
light
the
gas
directed
kline
curtly
and
being
obeyed
stooped
to
the
floor
and
picked
up
a
hypodermic
syringe
and
a
small
bottle
he
held
the
bottle
to
the
light
and
read
the
label
liquor
morphinae
shake
him
again
he
commanded
none
too
gently
a
policeman
caught
jimmie
dale
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
him
vigorously
again
jimmie
dale
once
the
other
let
go
his
hold
fell
back
limply
on
the
bed
breathing
in
that
same
slightly
slowed
way
larry
the
bat
eh
grunted
kline
then
to
the
officer
who
had
volunteered
the
information
who
larry
the
bat
what
is
he
and
how
long
have
you
known
him
i
do
know
who
he
is
any
more
than
what
you
can
see
there
for
yourself
replied
the
officer
he
a
dope
fiend
and
i
guess
a
pretty
tough
case
though
we
never
had
him
up
for
anything
he
lived
here
ever
since
i
been
on
the
beat
and
that
three
years
or
all
right
interrupted
kline
crisply
he
no
good
to
us
you
say
there
an
exit
from
this
house
into
that
saloon
at
the
back
yes
sir
but
the
fellow
whoever
he
is
could
get
away
from
there
heeney
been
over
on
guard
from
the
then
he
still
inside
there
said
kline
clipping
off
his
words
we
search
the
saloon
nice
night
work
this
is
one
out
of
the
whole
gang
and
that
one
with
the
compliments
of
the
gray
seal
the
men
went
out
and
began
to
descend
the
stairs
one
said
jimmie
dale
to
himself
still
motionless
still
breathing
in
that
slow
way
so
characteristic
of
the
drug
two
three
the
minutes
went
by
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
half
hour
still
jimmie
dale
lay
there
still
motionless
still
breathing
with
slow
regularity
his
muscles
began
to
cramp
to
give
him
exquisite
torture
around
him
all
was
silence
only
distant
sounds
from
the
street
reached
him
muffled
and
at
intervals
another
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
an
eternity
of
torment
it
seemed
to
jimmie
dale
for
all
his
will
power
that
he
could
not
hold
himself
in
check
that
he
must
move
scream
out
even
in
the
torture
that
was
passing
all
endurance
it
was
silent
now
utterly
silent
and
then
out
of
the
silence
just
outside
his
door
a
footstep
creaked
and
a
man
walked
to
the
stairs
and
went
down
five
said
jimmie
dale
to
himself
the
sharpest
man
in
the
united
states
secret
and
then
for
the
first
time
jimmie
dale
moved
to
wipe
away
the
beads
of
sweat
that
had
sprung
out
upon
his
forehead
chapter
v
the
affair
of
the
pushcart
man
larry
the
bat
shambled
out
of
the
side
door
of
the
tenement
into
the
back
alleyway
shambled
along
the
black
alleyway
to
the
street
and
smiled
a
little
grimly
as
a
shadow
across
the
roadway
suddenly
shifted
its
position
the
game
was
growing
acute
critical
desperate
even
and
it
was
his
move
larry
the
bat
disreputable
denizen
of
the
underworld
alias
jimmie
dale
millionaires
clubman
alias
the
gray
seal
whom
carruthers
of
the
morning
called
the
master
criminal
of
the
age
shuffled
along
in
the
direction
of
the
bowery
his
hands
plunged
deep
in
the
pockets
of
his
frayed
and
tattered
trousers
where
his
fingers
in
a
curious
wistful
way
fondled
the
keys
of
his
own
magnificent
residence
on
riverside
drive
it
was
his
move
and
it
was
an
impasse
ironical
sardonic
and
it
was
worse
it
was
full
of
peril
true
he
had
outwitted
kline
of
the
secret
service
two
nights
before
when
kline
had
raided
the
counterfeiters
den
true
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
kline
suspected
him
specifically
but
the
man
kline
wanted
had
entered
the
tenement
that
night
and
since
then
the
house
had
been
shadowed
day
and
night
the
result
was
both
simple
and
disastrous
to
jimmie
dale
larry
the
bat
a
known
inmate
of
the
house
might
come
and
go
as
he
pleased
but
to
emerge
from
the
sanctuary
in
the
person
of
jimmie
dale
would
be
fatal
kline
had
been
outwitted
but
kline
had
not
acknowledged
final
defeat
the
tenement
had
been
searched
from
top
to
bottom
unostentatiously
his
own
room
on
the
first
landing
had
been
searched
the
previous
afternoon
when
he
was
out
but
they
had
failed
to
find
the
cunningly
contrived
opening
in
the
floor
under
the
oilcloth
in
the
corner
an
impromptu
wardrobe
that
would
proclaim
larry
the
bat
and
jimmie
dale
to
be
one
and
the
same
person
that
would
inevitably
lead
further
to
the
establishment
of
his
identity
as
the
gray
seal
in
time
of
course
the
surveillance
would
cease
but
he
could
not
wait
that
was
the
monumental
irony
of
it
the
factor
that
all
unknown
to
kline
was
forcing
the
issue
hard
now
it
was
his
move
since
years
ago
now
as
the
gray
seal
he
had
begun
to
work
with
her
that
unknown
mysterious
accomplice
of
his
and
the
police
stung
to
madness
both
by
the
virulent
and
constant
attacks
of
the
press
and
by
the
humiliating
prod
of
their
own
failures
sought
daily
high
and
low
with
every
resource
at
their
command
for
the
gray
seal
he
had
never
been
in
quite
so
strange
and
perilous
a
plight
as
he
found
himself
at
that
moment
to
preserve
inviolate
the
identity
of
larry
the
bat
was
absolutely
vital
to
his
safety
it
was
the
one
secret
that
even
she
who
so
strangely
appeared
to
know
all
else
about
him
he
was
sure
had
not
discovered
and
it
was
just
that
in
a
way
that
had
brought
the
present
impossible
situation
to
pass
in
the
month
previous
in
a
lull
between
those
letters
of
hers
he
had
set
himself
doggedly
and
determinedly
to
the
renewed
task
of
what
had
become
so
dominantly
now
a
part
of
his
very
existence
the
solving
of
her
identity
and
for
that
month
as
the
best
means
to
the
end
means
however
that
only
resulted
as
futilely
as
the
attempts
that
had
gone
before
he
had
lived
mostly
as
larry
the
bat
returning
to
his
home
in
his
proper
person
only
when
occasion
and
necessity
demanded
it
he
had
been
going
home
that
evening
two
nights
before
walking
along
riverside
drive
when
from
the
window
of
the
limousine
she
had
dropped
the
letter
at
his
feet
that
had
plunged
him
into
the
affair
of
the
counterfeit
five
and
he
had
not
gone
home
eventually
to
save
himself
he
had
in
the
sanctuary
performing
the
transformation
in
desperate
haste
again
been
forced
to
assume
the
role
of
larry
the
bat
that
was
really
the
gist
of
it
and
yesterday
morning
he
had
remembered
to
his
dismay
that
he
had
had
little
or
no
money
left
the
night
before
he
had
intended
of
course
to
replenish
his
supply
when
he
got
home
only
he
had
gone
home
and
now
he
needed
money
needed
it
badly
desperately
with
thousands
in
the
bank
with
abundance
even
in
his
safe
in
his
own
den
at
home
a
supply
kept
there
always
for
an
emergency
he
was
facing
actual
want
he
rattled
two
dimes
a
nickel
and
a
few
odd
pennies
thoughtfully
against
the
keys
in
his
pocket
to
a
certain
extent
old
jason
his
butler
could
be
trusted
jason
even
knew
that
mysterious
letters
of
tremendous
secretive
importance
came
to
the
house
and
the
old
man
always
meant
well
but
he
dared
not
trust
even
jason
with
the
secret
of
his
dual
personality
what
was
he
to
do
he
needed
money
imperatively
at
once
thanks
to
kline
for
the
time
being
at
least
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
personality
of
larry
the
bat
by
the
simple
expedient
or
slipping
into
the
clothes
of
jimmie
dale
he
must
live
act
and
remain
larry
the
bat
until
the
secret
service
officer
gave
up
the
hunt
how
bridge
the
gulf
between
jimmie
dale
and
larry
the
bat
in
old
jason
eyes
nor
was
that
all
there
was
still
another
matter
and
one
that
in
order
to
counteract
it
demanded
at
once
a
serious
inroad
to
the
extent
of
a
telephone
call
upon
his
slender
capital
a
too
prolonged
and
absence
from
home
and
old
jason
in
his
anxious
blundering
solicitude
would
have
the
fat
in
the
fire
at
that
end
and
the
city
and
the
social
firmament
thereof
would
be
humming
with
the
startling
news
of
the
disappearance
of
a
millionaire
the
complications
that
would
then
ensue
with
himself
powerless
to
lift
a
finger
jimmie
dale
did
not
care
to
think
about
such
a
contretemps
must
at
all
hazards
be
prevented
jimmie
dale
reached
the
corner
of
the
street
where
it
intersected
the
bowery
and
paused
languidly
by
the
curb
no
one
appeared
to
be
following
he
had
not
expected
that
there
would
be
but
it
was
as
well
to
be
sure
he
walked
then
a
few
steps
along
the
bowery
and
slipped
suddenly
into
a
doorway
from
where
he
could
command
a
view
of
the
street
corner
that
he
had
just
left
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
satisfied
that
no
one
had
any
concern
in
his
immediate
movements
he
shambled
on
again
down
the
bowery
there
was
a
saloon
two
blocks
away
that
boasted
a
private
telephone
booth
jimmie
dale
made
that
his
destination
larry
the
bat
was
a
very
character
in
that
resort
and
the
dispenser
of
drinks
behind
the
bar
nodded
unctuously
to
him
over
the
heads
of
those
clustered
at
the
rail
as
he
entered
larry
the
bat
as
befitted
one
of
the
elite
of
the
underworld
was
graciously
pleased
to
acknowledge
the
proletariat
salutation
with
a
curt
nod
he
walked
down
to
the
end
of
the
room
entered
the
telephone
booth
and
was
carelessly
careful
to
close
the
door
tightly
behind
him
he
gave
the
number
of
his
residence
on
riverside
drive
and
waited
for
the
connection
after
some
delay
jason
voice
answered
him
jason
said
jimmie
dale
in
tones
i
shall
be
out
of
the
city
for
another
three
or
four
days
possibly
a
week
and
he
stopped
abruptly
as
a
sort
of
gasp
came
to
him
over
the
wire
thank
god
that
you
sir
exclaimed
the
old
butler
wildly
i
been
near
mad
sir
all
day
do
get
excited
jason
said
jimmie
dale
a
little
sharply
the
mere
matter
of
my
absence
for
the
last
two
days
is
nothing
to
cause
you
any
concern
and
while
i
am
on
the
subject
jason
let
me
say
now
that
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
bear
that
fact
in
mind
in
yes
sir
stammered
jason
but
sir
it
ai
that
good
lord
master
jim
it
ai
that
sir
it
it
one
of
them
something
like
a
galvanic
shock
seemed
to
jerk
the
disreputable
frame
of
larry
the
bat
suddenly
erect
and
a
strained
whiteness
crept
over
the
dirty
unwashed
face
go
on
jason
said
jimmie
dale
without
a
quiver
in
his
voice
it
came
this
morning
sir
that
shuffer
with
his
automobile
left
it
i
had
just
time
to
say
you
were
at
home
sir
and
he
was
gone
and
then
sir
there
ai
been
an
hour
gone
by
all
through
the
day
that
a
woman
sir
a
lady
begging
your
pardon
master
jim
has
rung
up
on
the
telephone
asking
if
you
were
back
and
if
i
could
get
you
and
where
you
were
and
half
frantic
sir
half
sobbing
sometimes
sir
and
saying
there
was
a
life
hanging
on
it
master
larry
the
bat
staring
into
the
mouthpiece
of
the
instrument
subconsciously
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
subconsciously
noted
that
his
fingers
as
he
drew
them
away
were
damp
where
is
the
letter
now
jason
inquired
jimmie
dale
coolly
here
on
your
desk
master
jim
shall
i
bring
it
to
you
bring
it
to
him
how
when
where
bring
it
to
him
the
ghastly
irony
of
it
jimmie
dale
tried
to
think
prodding
spurring
desperately
that
keen
lightning
brain
of
his
that
had
never
failed
him
yet
how
bridge
the
gulf
between
larry
the
bat
and
jimmie
dale
in
jason
eyes
not
just
for
the
replenishing
of
funds
now
but
with
a
life
at
stake
no
i
think
not
jason
said
jimmie
dale
calmly
just
leave
it
where
it
is
and
if
she
telephones
again
say
that
you
have
told
me
that
will
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
any
further
inquiries
and
jason
yes
sir
if
she
telephones
again
try
and
find
out
where
the
call
comes
i
have
forgotten
what
you
said
once
master
jim
sir
said
the
old
man
eagerly
and
i
been
trying
that
sir
all
day
they
all
come
from
different
pay
stations
a
mirthless
little
smile
tinged
jimmie
dale
lips
of
course
he
might
have
known
it
was
always
that
way
always
the
same
he
was
as
near
to
the
solution
of
her
identity
at
that
moment
as
he
had
been
years
ago
when
she
in
some
mysterious
way
alone
of
all
the
world
had
identified
him
as
the
gray
seal
very
good
jason
he
said
quietly
do
bother
about
it
any
more
it
will
be
all
right
you
can
expect
me
when
you
see
me
he
hung
the
receiver
on
the
hook
walked
out
of
the
booth
and
mechanically
reached
the
street
all
right
it
was
far
from
all
right
very
far
from
it
it
was
no
trivial
thing
that
letter
they
never
had
been
trivial
things
those
letters
of
hers
that
involved
so
often
a
matter
of
life
and
death
as
this
one
now
perhaps
as
her
actions
would
seem
to
indicate
involved
life
and
death
more
urgently
than
any
that
had
gone
before
it
was
far
from
all
right
at
a
moment
when
his
own
position
his
own
safety
was
at
best
but
a
desperate
chance
when
his
every
energy
brain
wit
and
cunning
were
taxed
to
the
utmost
to
save
himself
and
yet
somehow
some
way
at
any
cost
he
must
get
that
letter
and
at
any
cost
he
must
act
upon
it
to
fail
her
was
to
fail
utterly
in
everything
that
failure
in
its
most
miserable
its
widest
sense
implied
failure
in
that
which
rose
paramount
to
every
other
consideration
in
life
fail
her
jimmie
dale
lips
thinned
into
a
hard
drawn
line
and
then
parted
slowly
in
a
curiously
whimsical
smile
it
would
be
a
strange
burglary
that
he
had
decided
upon
in
order
that
he
might
not
fail
her
stranger
than
any
the
gray
seal
had
ever
committed
and
in
some
respects
even
more
perilous
he
started
along
the
bowery
walking
briskly
now
toward
the
nearest
subway
station
at
astor
place
his
mind
for
the
moment
electing
to
face
the
situation
in
a
humour
as
whimsical
as
his
smile
supposing
that
as
larry
the
bat
he
were
caught
and
arrested
during
the
next
hour
in
jimmie
dale
residence
on
riverside
drive
with
his
arrest
as
larry
the
bat
jimmie
dale
would
automatically
disappear
would
follow
then
the
suspicion
that
jimmie
dale
the
millionaire
had
met
with
foul
play
and
as
time
went
on
and
jimmie
dale
being
then
in
prison
as
larry
the
bat
did
not
reappear
the
assurance
of
it
then
the
certainty
that
suspicion
would
focus
on
larry
the
bat
as
being
connected
with
the
millionaire
death
since
larry
the
bat
had
been
caught
in
jimmie
dale
home
and
he
would
be
accused
of
his
own
murder
it
was
quite
humourous
of
course
quite
grotesquely
bizarre
but
it
was
equally
an
exceedingly
grim
possibility
there
were
drawbacks
to
a
dual
personality
in
a
word
confided
jimmie
dale
softly
to
himself
and
a
serious
light
crept
into
the
dark
steady
eyes
i
in
a
bit
of
a
nasty
mess
at
astor
place
he
entered
the
subway
at
fourteenth
street
he
changed
to
an
express
and
at
street
he
got
out
it
was
but
a
short
walk
west
to
riverside
drive
and
from
there
his
house
was
only
a
few
blocks
farther
on
jimmie
dale
did
not
slouch
now
and
for
all
his
disreputable
attire
incongruous
as
it
was
in
that
neighbourhood
few
people
that
he
passed
paid
any
attention
to
him
none
gave
him
more
than
a
casual
glance
jimmie
dale
swung
along
upright
with
no
attempt
to
make
himself
inconspicuous
hurrying
a
little
as
one
intent
upon
a
definite
errand
as
he
neared
his
house
he
slowed
his
pace
a
little
until
a
couple
who
were
passing
in
front
of
it
had
gone
on
then
he
went
up
the
steps
but
noiselessly
as
a
shadow
now
to
the
front
door
opened
it
softly
closed
it
softly
behind
him
and
crouched
for
a
moment
in
the
vestibule
through
the
monogrammed
lace
on
the
plate
glass
of
the
inner
doors
he
could
see
a
little
indistinctly
into
the
reception
hall
beyond
the
hall
was
empty
jason
for
that
matter
would
be
the
only
one
likely
to
be
about
the
other
servants
would
have
no
business
there
in
any
case
and
whether
in
their
quarters
above
or
below
they
had
their
own
stairs
at
the
rear
jimmie
dale
inserted
the
key
in
the
spring
lock
and
opened
the
door
a
cautious
fraction
of
an
inch
to
listen
there
was
no
sound
yes
a
subdued
murmured
the
servants
were
downstairs
in
the
basement
he
slipped
inside
slipped
in
a
flash
across
the
hall
and
treading
like
a
cat
went
up
the
stairs
he
scarcely
seemed
to
breathe
until
with
a
little
sigh
of
relief
he
stood
inside
his
den
on
the
first
floor
with
the
door
shut
behind
him
i
must
speak
to
jason
about
being
a
little
more
watchful
muttered
jimmie
dale
facetiously
here
all
my
property
at
the
mercy
of
larry
the
bat
an
instant
he
stood
by
the
door
looking
about
him
in
the
bright
moonlight
streaming
in
through
the
side
windows
the
room
appointments
stood
out
in
soft
shadows
the
huge
davenport
the
great
luxurious
an
easel
with
a
canvas
as
he
had
left
it
the
big
rosewood
desk
the
open
fireplace
and
then
his
steps
silent
on
the
thick
velvet
rug
under
foot
he
walked
quickly
to
the
desk
yes
there
it
was
the
letter
he
placed
it
hurriedly
in
his
pocket
the
moonlight
was
not
strong
enough
to
read
by
and
he
dared
not
turn
on
the
lights
and
now
money
funds
in
the
alcove
behind
the
portiere
jimmie
dale
dropped
on
his
knees
before
the
squat
safe
and
opened
it
he
reached
inside
took
out
a
package
of
banknotes
placed
the
bills
in
his
pocket
and
hesitated
a
moment
what
else
would
he
require
what
act
did
that
letter
call
upon
the
gray
seal
to
perform
in
the
next
few
hours
jimmie
dale
stared
thoughtfully
into
the
interior
of
the
safe
whatever
it
was
it
must
be
performed
in
the
role
of
larry
the
bat
for
though
he
could
get
into
his
dressing
room
now
and
become
jimmie
dale
again
there
were
still
those
watchers
outside
the
sanctuary
they
must
not
become
suspicious
and
if
larry
the
bat
disappeared
mysteriously
larry
the
bat
would
be
the
man
that
kline
and
the
secret
service
of
the
united
states
would
never
cease
hunting
for
and
that
would
mean
that
he
could
never
reassume
a
character
that
was
as
necessary
for
his
protection
as
breath
was
to
life
so
long
as
the
gray
seal
worked
true
he
could
change
now
to
jimmie
dale
but
he
would
have
to
change
back
again
and
return
to
the
sanctuary
before
morning
as
larry
the
bat
and
remain
there
until
kline
beaten
called
off
his
human
bloodhounds
no
a
change
was
not
to
be
thought
of
what
then
would
he
require
that
compact
little
kit
of
burglar
tools
rolled
in
its
leather
jacket
that
unrolled
slipped
about
his
body
like
a
undervest
as
well
to
take
it
anyway
he
removed
his
coat
and
vest
took
out
the
leather
bundle
from
the
safe
untied
the
thongs
that
bound
it
together
unrolled
it
passed
it
around
his
body
life
belt
fashion
secured
the
thongs
over
his
shoulders
and
put
on
his
coat
and
vest
again
a
revolver
a
flashlight
he
had
both
at
the
sanctuary
under
the
flooring
but
there
were
duplicates
here
he
slipped
them
into
his
pockets
anything
else
to
forestall
and
provide
for
any
possible
contingency
he
hesitated
again
for
a
moment
thinking
then
slowly
closed
the
inner
door
of
the
safe
locked
it
swung
the
outer
door
shut
and
in
the
act
of
twirling
the
knobs
sprang
suddenly
to
his
feet
sharp
shrill
in
the
stillness
of
the
room
the
telephone
bell
on
the
desk
rang
out
clamourously
jimmie
dale
face
set
hard
as
he
leaped
out
from
behind
the
curtain
had
jason
heard
it
it
rang
again
before
he
could
reach
the
desk
was
ringing
as
he
snatched
the
receiver
from
the
hook
yes
yes
he
called
in
a
low
guarded
hasty
way
into
the
mouthpiece
hello
what
is
it
and
then
one
hand
resting
on
the
desk
closed
around
the
edge
and
tightened
until
the
skin
over
the
knuckles
grew
ivory
white
it
was
she
she
it
was
her
voice
he
had
only
heard
it
once
in
all
his
life
that
night
two
nights
before
in
a
silvery
laugh
from
the
limousine
as
it
had
sped
away
from
him
down
the
road
but
he
knew
it
thrilled
him
now
with
a
mad
rhapsody
robbing
him
for
the
moment
of
every
thought
save
that
she
was
living
real
existent
that
it
was
her
voice
it
you
you
he
said
hoarsely
oh
jimmie
you
at
last
it
came
in
a
little
gasping
cry
of
relief
the
letter
yes
i
got
it
it
all
right
it
all
right
the
words
would
not
seem
to
come
fast
enough
in
his
desperate
haste
but
it
you
now
listen
listen
he
pleaded
tell
me
who
you
are
my
god
how
tried
to
find
you
and
that
rippling
silvery
laugh
again
but
now
too
it
seemed
to
his
eager
ear
with
just
the
faintest
note
of
wistfulness
in
it
some
day
jimmie
that
letter
now
it
jimmie
dale
straightened
up
suddenly
jason
steps
running
sounded
outside
the
room
along
the
corridor
there
was
not
an
instant
to
lose
hang
up
danger
do
ring
again
he
whispered
hurriedly
and
with
a
miserable
smile
replacing
the
receiver
bitterly
on
the
hook
he
jumped
for
the
curtain
he
reached
it
none
too
soon
the
door
opened
an
switch
clicked
and
the
room
was
flooded
with
light
jason
still
running
headed
for
the
desk
it
be
her
again
jimmie
dale
heard
the
old
man
mutter
as
from
the
edge
of
the
portiere
he
watched
the
other
actions
jason
picked
up
the
telephone
hello
hello
he
called
then
began
to
click
impatiently
with
the
receiver
hook
hello
who
central
i
do
want
any
number
somebody
was
calling
here
what
nobody
on
the
wire
he
set
the
telephone
back
on
the
desk
with
a
bewildered
air
that
queer
he
exclaimed
i
could
have
sworn
i
heard
it
ring
twice
and
he
stopped
abruptly
and
leaning
across
the
desk
hung
there
staring
while
a
sickly
pallor
began
to
steal
into
his
face
the
letter
he
mumbled
wildly
the
letter
master
jim
letter
the
letter
it
gone
trembling
excited
the
old
man
began
to
search
the
desk
then
down
on
his
knees
on
the
floor
under
it
and
then
growing
more
frantic
with
every
instant
rose
and
began
to
hunt
around
the
room
in
an
agitated
aimless
fashion
jason
distress
was
very
real
he
was
almost
beside
himself
now
with
fear
and
anxiety
a
whimsical
affectionate
smile
played
over
jimmie
dale
lips
at
the
old
man
antics
and
changed
suddenly
into
one
of
consternation
jason
was
making
directly
now
for
the
curtain
behind
which
he
stood
perhaps
though
he
would
pass
it
by
and
jason
hand
reached
out
and
grasped
the
portiere
jason
said
jimmie
dale
sharply
the
old
man
staggered
back
as
though
he
had
been
struck
tried
to
speak
choked
and
gazed
at
the
curtain
with
distended
eyes
is
is
that
you
sir
master
jim
behind
the
curtain
there
he
finally
blurted
out
i
sir
you
gave
me
a
start
and
the
letter
master
jim
do
lose
your
head
jason
said
jimmie
dale
coolly
i
got
the
letter
now
do
as
i
bid
yes
master
jim
faltered
the
old
man
pull
down
the
window
shades
and
draw
the
portiere
together
directed
jimmie
dale
jason
still
overwrought
and
excited
obeyed
a
little
awkwardly
now
the
lights
jason
instructed
jimmie
dale
turn
them
off
and
go
and
sit
down
in
that
chair
at
the
again
jason
obeyed
stumbling
in
the
darkness
as
he
returned
from
the
switch
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
he
sat
down
in
the
chair
larry
the
bat
stepped
out
from
behind
the
curtain
i
came
for
that
letter
jason
he
explained
quietly
i
am
going
out
again
now
i
may
be
back
i
may
not
be
back
for
a
week
you
will
say
nothing
not
a
word
of
my
having
been
here
do
you
understand
jason
yes
sir
said
jason
then
hesitantly
would
you
mind
saying
sir
when
you
came
in
it
of
no
consequence
jason
is
it
no
sir
said
jason
jimmie
dale
smiled
in
the
darkness
jason
yes
i
wish
you
to
remain
where
you
are
without
leaving
that
chair
for
the
next
ten
he
moved
across
the
room
to
the
door
jason
he
said
master
jim
sir
oh
lord
jimmie
dale
did
not
require
that
ten
minutes
it
was
a
very
wide
margin
of
safety
to
obviate
the
possibility
of
jason
from
a
window
detecting
the
exit
of
a
disreputable
character
from
the
house
in
three
minutes
he
was
turning
the
corner
of
the
first
cross
street
and
walking
rapidly
away
from
riverside
drive
in
the
subway
station
jimmie
dale
read
the
letter
read
it
twice
over
as
he
always
read
those
strange
epistles
of
hers
that
opened
the
door
to
new
peril
new
danger
to
the
gray
seal
but
too
that
seemed
somehow
to
draw
tighter
in
a
glad
big
way
the
unseen
bond
between
them
read
it
as
he
always
read
those
letters
almost
subconsciously
committing
the
very
words
to
memory
with
that
keen
faculty
of
brain
of
his
but
now
as
he
began
to
tear
the
sheet
and
envelope
into
minute
particles
a
strained
hard
look
was
on
his
face
and
in
his
eyes
and
his
lips
half
parted
moved
a
little
it
a
death
warrant
muttered
jimmie
dale
i
i
guess
will
see
the
end
of
the
gray
seal
she
says
i
need
do
it
but
i
guess
worth
the
risk
a
human
life
a
downtown
express
roared
into
the
station
what
time
is
it
jimmie
dale
asked
the
guard
as
he
stepped
aboard
midnight
the
man
answered
tersely
the
forward
car
was
almost
empty
and
jimmie
dale
chose
a
seat
by
himself
how
did
she
know
how
did
she
know
not
only
this
but
the
hundred
other
affairs
that
she
had
outlined
in
those
letters
of
hers
by
what
means
superhuman
indeed
it
seemed
did
she
jimmie
dale
jerked
himself
erect
suddenly
what
good
did
it
do
to
speculate
on
that
now
when
every
minute
was
priceless
what
was
he
to
do
how
was
he
to
act
what
plan
could
he
formulate
and
carry
out
and
win
against
odds
that
at
the
outset
were
desperate
enough
even
to
forecast
almost
certain
failure
and
death
who
would
ever
have
suspected
old
tom
ludgate
known
for
years
throughout
the
squalour
of
the
east
side
as
old
luddy
the
pushcart
man
of
having
a
bag
of
unset
diamonds
under
his
pillow
or
under
the
sack
rather
that
he
probably
used
for
a
pillow
what
a
queer
thing
to
do
but
then
old
luddy
was
a
character
apparently
always
in
the
most
condition
apparently
hardly
more
than
keeping
body
and
soul
together
trusting
no
one
and
obsessed
by
the
dread
that
by
depositing
in
a
bank
some
one
would
discover
that
he
had
money
and
attempt
to
force
it
from
him
he
had
put
his
savings
year
after
year
for
twenty
years
years
perhaps
into
unset
stone
diamonds
how
had
she
found
that
out
jimmie
dale
sank
into
a
deeper
reverie
he
could
steal
them
all
right
and
they
would
be
well
worth
the
stealing
old
luddy
had
done
well
and
lived
and
existed
on
next
to
nothing
the
stones
she
said
were
worth
about
fifteen
thousand
dollars
not
so
bad
even
for
years
of
vegetable
selling
from
a
pushcart
he
could
steal
them
all
right
it
would
tax
the
gray
seal
ingenuity
little
to
do
so
simple
a
thing
as
that
but
that
was
not
all
nor
indeed
hardly
a
factor
in
it
it
was
vital
that
if
he
were
to
succeed
at
all
he
must
steal
them
publicly
as
it
were
and
after
that
what
his
own
chances
were
pretty
slim
at
best
jimmie
dale
staring
at
the
grayness
of
the
subway
wall
through
the
window
shook
his
head
slowly
then
with
a
queer
little
philosophical
shrug
of
his
shoulders
he
smiled
gravely
seriously
it
was
all
a
part
of
the
game
all
a
part
of
the
life
of
the
gray
seal
it
was
twelve
or
a
little
later
as
nearly
as
he
could
judge
for
larry
the
bat
carried
no
such
ornate
thing
in
evidence
as
a
watch
as
he
halted
at
the
corner
of
a
dark
squalid
street
in
the
lower
east
side
it
was
a
miserable
locality
in
daylight
humming
with
a
cosmopolitan
hive
of
pitiful
humans
dragging
out
as
best
they
could
an
intolerable
existence
a
locality
peopled
with
every
nationality
on
earth
their
community
of
interest
the
struggle
to
maintain
life
at
the
lowest
possible
expenditure
where
necessity
even
was
pared
and
shaved
down
to
a
minimum
but
now
at
night
time
or
rather
in
the
hours
the
darkness
in
very
mercy
it
seemed
covered
it
with
a
veil
as
it
were
and
in
the
quiet
that
hung
over
it
now
hid
the
bald
the
hideous
aye
and
the
piteous
too
from
view
it
was
a
narrow
street
and
the
row
of
tenement
houses
each
house
almost
identical
with
its
neighbour
that
flanked
the
pavement
on
either
side
seemed
from
where
jimmie
dale
stood
looking
down
its
length
from
the
corner
to
converge
together
at
a
point
a
little
way
beyond
giving
it
an
unreal
ominous
cavernlike
effect
and
too
there
seemed
something
ominous
even
in
its
quiet
it
was
as
though
one
sensed
acutely
the
crouching
of
some
thing
in
its
lair
waiting
silently
viciously
with
sullen
patience
a
footstep
sounded
another
jimmie
dale
drew
quickly
back
around
the
corner
into
an
areaway
two
men
passed
in
helmets
swinging
their
nightsticks
that
beat
was
always
policed
in
pairs
they
passed
on
turned
the
corner
and
went
down
the
narrow
cross
street
that
jimmie
dale
had
just
been
inspecting
he
started
to
follow
and
drew
back
again
abruptly
a
form
flitted
suddenly
across
the
road
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
in
the
officers
wake
ten
yards
behind
the
first
another
followed
at
the
same
interval
of
distance
still
another
and
yet
still
one
more
four
in
all
the
darkness
hid
all
six
the
two
policemen
the
four
men
behind
them
the
only
sounds
were
the
officers
footsteps
dying
away
in
the
distance
jimmie
dale
fingers
were
mechanically
testing
the
mechanism
of
the
automatic
in
his
pocket
the
skeeter
gang
he
muttered
to
himself
red
mose
the
midget
harve
thoms
and
the
skeeter
the
worst
apaches
in
the
city
of
new
york
death
contractors
the
lowest
bidders
professional
assassins
and
a
man
life
any
time
for
dollars
i
wonder
i
never
done
it
yet
but
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
a
crime
in
god
sight
if
one
shot
to
kill
jimmie
dale
was
at
the
corner
again
again
the
street
before
him
was
black
deserted
empty
he
chose
the
right
hand
side
and
well
in
the
shadow
of
the
houses
as
an
extra
precaution
stole
along
silently
he
stopped
finally
before
one
where
in
the
doorway
hung
a
little
sign
jimmie
dale
mounted
the
porch
and
with
his
eyes
close
to
the
sign
could
just
make
out
the
larger
words
in
the
big
printed
type
room
to
rent
top
floor
jimmie
dale
nodded
that
was
right
the
first
house
on
the
side
with
the
sign
her
letter
had
said
his
fingers
were
testing
the
doorknob
the
door
was
not
locked
naturally
it
would
be
locked
jimmie
dale
told
himself
grimly
and
stepped
inside
he
stood
for
an
instant
without
movement
every
faculty
on
the
alert
far
up
above
him
a
step
guarded
though
his
trained
ear
made
it
out
to
be
creaked
faintly
upon
the
stairs
there
was
no
other
sound
the
creaking
almost
inaudible
at
its
loudest
receded
farther
up
and
silence
fell
in
the
darkness
noiselessly
jimmie
dale
groped
for
the
stairway
found
it
and
began
to
ascend
the
minutes
passed
it
seemed
a
minute
even
from
step
to
step
and
there
were
three
flights
to
the
top
there
must
be
no
creaking
this
time
the
slightest
sound
he
knew
well
enough
would
be
not
only
fatal
to
the
work
he
had
to
do
but
probably
fatal
to
himself
as
well
he
had
been
near
death
many
times
the
consciousness
that
he
was
nearer
to
it
now
possibly
than
he
had
ever
been
before
seemed
to
stimulate
his
senses
into
acute
and
abnormal
energy
and
too
the
physical
effort
as
step
by
step
the
flexed
muscles
relaxing
so
slowly
little
by
little
gradually
each
time
as
he
found
foothold
on
the
step
higher
up
was
a
terrific
strain
at
the
top
his
face
was
bathed
in
perspiration
and
he
wiped
it
off
with
his
coat
sleeve
it
was
still
dark
here
intensely
dark
and
his
eyes
though
grown
accustomed
to
it
could
make
out
nothing
but
the
deeper
shadow
of
the
walls
but
thanks
to
her
always
a
mistress
of
accurate
and
minute
detail
he
possessed
a
mental
plan
of
his
surroundings
the
head
of
the
stairs
gave
on
the
middle
of
the
hallway
the
hallway
ran
to
his
right
and
left
to
his
right
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hall
was
the
door
of
old
luddy
squalid
apartment
for
a
moment
jimmie
dale
stood
hesitant
a
sudden
perplexity
and
anxiety
growing
upon
him
it
was
strange
what
did
it
mean
he
had
nerved
himself
to
a
quick
desperate
attempt
trusting
to
surprise
and
his
own
wit
and
agility
for
victory
there
had
seemed
no
other
way
than
that
since
he
had
seen
those
four
men
at
the
corner
since
they
were
ahead
of
him
true
they
were
not
much
ahead
of
him
not
enough
to
have
accomplished
their
purpose
and
furthermore
they
were
not
in
that
room
he
knew
that
absolutely
beyond
question
of
doubt
he
had
listened
for
just
that
all
the
way
up
the
stairs
but
where
were
they
there
was
no
sound
not
a
sound
just
blackness
dark
impenetrable
utter
that
began
to
palpitate
now
it
came
in
a
whisper
wavering
sibilant
from
his
left
a
sort
of
relief
fierce
in
the
breaking
of
the
tense
expectancy
premonitory
in
the
possibilities
that
it
held
swept
jimmie
dale
he
crept
along
the
hall
the
whisper
had
come
from
that
room
presumably
empty
that
was
for
rent
by
the
door
he
crouched
his
sensitive
fingers
eyes
to
jimmie
dale
so
often
feeling
over
jamb
and
panels
with
a
delicate
soundless
touch
the
door
was
just
ajar
the
fingers
crept
inside
and
touched
the
knob
and
lock
there
was
no
key
within
the
whispering
still
went
on
but
it
seemed
like
a
screaming
of
vultures
now
in
jimmie
dale
ears
as
the
words
came
to
him
aw
say
skeeter
dis
stunt
gives
me
de
pip
me
fer
goin
in
dere
an
croakin
de
geezer
widout
de
frills
who
to
know
say
just
about
two
minutes
an
we
beatin
it
wid
de
an
inch
a
half
inch
at
a
time
the
knob
slowly
very
very
slowly
turning
the
door
was
being
closed
by
the
crouched
form
on
the
threshold
close
yer
trap
mose
came
a
fierce
response
we
ai
fixed
the
lay
all
day
for
nothin
there
ai
a
soul
on
earth
knows
he
got
any
sparklers
us
if
there
was
it
would
be
different
then
know
that
was
what
whoever
did
it
was
after
see
the
door
was
closed
the
knob
slowly
very
very
slowly
being
released
again
from
one
of
the
leather
pockets
under
jimmie
dale
vest
came
a
tiny
steel
instrument
that
he
inserted
in
the
the
same
voice
spoke
on
that
what
we
croaking
him
for
nobody
knows
about
them
diamonds
and
so
he
ca
tell
anybody
afterward
that
any
were
pinched
an
that
why
it
got
to
look
like
he
just
got
tired
of
living
and
did
it
himself
i
guess
that
hold
the
police
when
they
find
the
poor
old
duck
hanging
from
the
ceiling
with
a
bit
of
cord
around
his
neck
and
a
chair
kicked
out
from
under
his
feet
on
the
floor
ai
you
got
the
brains
of
a
louse
to
see
that
sure
the
whisper
came
dully
in
grudging
intonation
through
the
panels
the
door
was
locked
sure
but
it
de
hangin
to
get
busy
that
gettin
me
goat
an
jimmie
dale
straightened
up
and
began
to
retreat
along
the
corridor
a
merciless
rage
was
upon
him
now
every
fiber
of
his
being
seemed
to
tingle
and
quiver
with
it
the
damnable
hellish
ingenuity
of
it
all
seemed
to
choke
and
suffocate
him
luck
muttered
jimmie
dale
between
his
clenched
teeth
oh
the
blessed
luck
to
get
that
door
locked
i
got
time
now
to
set
the
stage
for
my
own
before
the
showdown
he
stole
on
along
the
corridor
excerpts
from
her
letter
were
running
through
his
brain
it
would
do
no
good
to
warn
him
jimmie
the
skeeter
and
his
gang
would
never
let
up
on
him
until
they
got
the
stones
it
would
do
no
good
for
you
to
steal
them
first
for
they
would
only
take
that
as
a
ruse
of
old
luddy
and
murder
the
man
first
and
hunt
afterward
in
some
way
you
must
let
the
skeeter
see
you
steal
them
make
them
think
make
them
certain
that
it
is
a
theft
so
that
they
will
no
longer
have
any
interest
or
any
desire
to
do
old
luddy
harm
and
for
it
to
appear
real
to
them
it
must
appear
real
to
old
luddy
himself
do
not
take
any
chances
jimmie
dale
eyes
narrowed
yes
it
was
simple
enough
now
with
that
pack
of
hell
wolves
guarded
for
the
moment
by
a
locked
door
forced
to
give
him
warning
by
breaking
the
door
before
they
could
get
out
it
was
simple
enough
now
to
enter
old
luddy
room
steal
the
stones
at
the
revolver
point
then
make
enough
disturbance
when
he
was
ready
to
set
the
gang
in
motion
and
as
they
rushed
in
open
him
to
make
his
escape
with
the
stones
to
the
roof
through
luddy
room
that
was
simple
enough
there
was
an
opening
to
the
roof
in
luddy
room
she
had
said
and
there
was
a
ladder
kept
there
in
place
on
hot
nights
it
seemed
the
old
man
used
to
go
up
there
and
sleep
on
the
roof
not
now
of
course
it
was
too
late
in
the
year
for
that
but
the
opening
in
the
roof
was
there
and
the
ladder
remained
there
too
yes
it
was
simple
enough
now
and
the
next
morning
the
papers
would
rave
with
execrations
against
the
gray
seal
for
the
robbery
of
the
life
savings
of
a
poor
defenseless
old
man
for
committing
as
vile
and
pitiful
a
crime
as
had
ever
stirred
new
york
even
carruthers
of
the
morning
would
be
moved
to
bitter
attack
good
old
carruthers
who
little
thought
that
the
gray
seal
was
his
old
college
pal
his
present
most
intimate
friend
jimmie
dale
and
afterward
after
the
next
morning
well
that
at
least
had
never
been
in
doubt
old
luddy
could
be
made
to
leave
new
york
and
once
away
with
the
skeeter
and
his
gang
robbed
of
incentive
to
pay
any
further
attention
to
him
the
stones
could
be
secretly
returned
to
the
old
man
and
it
would
to
the
public
to
the
police
be
just
another
of
the
gray
crimes
that
was
all
jimmie
dale
had
reached
old
luddy
door
the
gray
seal
oh
yes
they
would
know
it
was
the
gray
seal
the
insignia
was
familiar
enough
familiar
to
the
crooks
of
the
underworld
who
held
it
in
awe
familiar
to
the
police
to
whom
it
was
an
added
barb
of
ridicule
he
was
placing
it
now
that
insignia
a
gray
paper
seal
on
the
panel
of
the
door
and
now
a
black
silk
mask
adjusted
over
his
face
jimmie
dale
bent
to
insert
the
little
steel
instrument
in
the
lock
a
pitiful
paltry
thing
a
cheap
lock
to
fingers
that
could
play
so
intimately
with
twirling
knobs
and
dials
masters
of
the
intricate
mechanism
of
vaults
and
safes
and
then
about
to
open
the
door
a
sort
of
sudden
dismay
fell
upon
him
he
had
not
thought
of
that
somehow
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
what
was
it
they
were
waiting
for
why
had
they
not
struck
at
once
as
when
he
had
first
entered
the
house
he
had
supposed
they
would
do
what
was
it
why
was
it
was
old
luddy
out
were
they
waiting
for
his
return
or
what
the
door
without
sound
moved
gradually
under
his
hand
a
faint
odor
assailed
his
nostrils
it
was
dark
very
dark
across
the
room
in
a
direct
line
was
the
doorway
of
the
inner
room
she
had
explained
that
in
her
letter
it
was
slow
progress
to
cross
that
room
without
sound
in
silence
it
was
a
snail
movement
for
fear
that
even
a
muscle
might
crack
and
now
he
stood
in
the
inner
doorway
it
was
dark
here
to
and
yet
how
bizarre
a
star
seemed
to
twinkle
through
the
very
roof
of
the
room
itself
the
odour
was
pungent
now
there
was
a
sigh
then
a
low
indescribable
sound
of
movement
somebody
apart
from
old
luddy
was
in
the
room
it
swept
the
full
consciousness
of
it
upon
jimmie
dale
in
an
instantaneous
flash
chloroform
the
open
scuttle
in
the
roof
the
waiting
of
those
others
all
fused
into
a
compact
logical
whole
they
had
loosened
the
scuttle
during
the
day
probably
when
old
luddy
was
away
one
of
them
had
crept
down
there
now
to
chloroform
the
old
man
into
insensibility
the
others
would
complete
the
ghastly
work
presently
by
stringing
their
victim
up
to
the
ceiling
and
it
would
be
suicide
for
long
before
morning
came
long
before
the
old
man
would
be
discovered
the
fumes
of
the
chloroform
would
be
gone
it
seemed
like
a
cold
hand
deathlike
clutching
at
his
heart
was
he
too
late
after
all
chloroform
alone
could
kill
to
the
right
just
a
little
to
the
right
he
must
make
no
mistake
his
ear
placed
the
sound
he
whipped
his
hands
from
the
side
pockets
of
his
coat
the
ray
of
his
flashlight
cut
across
the
room
and
fell
upon
an
aged
face
upon
a
bed
upon
a
hand
clutching
a
wad
of
cloth
the
cloth
pressed
horribly
against
the
nose
and
mouth
of
the
upturned
face
and
then
roaring
in
the
stillness
spitting
a
vicious
lane
of
fire
that
paralleled
the
flashlight
ray
came
the
tongue
flame
of
his
automatic
there
was
a
yell
a
scream
that
echoed
out
reverberated
and
went
racketing
through
the
house
and
jimmie
dale
leaped
forward
over
a
table
sending
it
crashing
to
the
floor
the
man
had
reeled
back
against
the
wall
clutching
at
a
shattered
wrist
staring
into
the
eye
jaw
dropped
lips
working
in
mingled
pain
and
fear
harve
thoms
you
eh
gritted
jimmie
dale
a
cunning
look
swept
the
distorted
face
here
apparently
was
only
one
man
there
were
pals
three
of
them
only
a
few
yards
away
you
ai
got
nothing
on
me
he
snarled
sparring
for
time
you
police
are
too
damned
fresh
with
your
guns
i
take
yours
snapped
jimmie
dale
and
snatched
it
deftly
from
the
other
pocket
this
ai
any
police
job
my
bucko
and
you
make
a
move
and
i
drop
you
for
keeps
if
what
you
got
already
enough
to
teach
you
to
keep
your
hands
off
jobs
that
belong
to
your
betters
he
was
working
with
mad
haste
as
he
spoke
one
minute
at
the
outside
was
perhaps
all
he
could
count
upon
already
he
had
caught
the
rattle
of
the
locked
door
down
the
hall
he
lit
a
match
and
turned
on
the
gas
over
the
bed
it
was
the
most
dangerous
thing
he
could
do
he
knew
that
well
enough
none
knew
it
better
it
was
offering
himself
as
a
fair
mark
when
the
others
rushed
in
as
they
would
in
a
moment
now
but
the
skeeter
and
his
gang
and
this
man
here
must
have
no
misconception
of
his
purpose
his
reason
for
being
there
the
same
as
their
own
the
theft
of
the
stones
and
no
misconception
as
to
his
success
the
police
it
came
in
a
choked
gasp
from
the
other
as
he
blinked
in
the
sudden
light
say
then
shut
up
ordered
jimmie
dale
curtly
and
mind
what
i
told
you
about
moving
he
leaned
over
the
bed
old
luddy
though
under
the
influence
of
the
chloroform
was
moving
restlessly
thoms
had
evidently
only
begun
to
apply
the
chloroform
old
luddy
was
safe
jimmie
dale
ran
his
hand
in
under
the
pillow
if
you
ai
swiped
them
already
they
ought
to
be
here
he
growled
and
if
you
have
i
ah
a
little
chamois
bag
was
in
his
hand
he
laughed
sneeringly
at
thoms
opened
the
bag
allowed
a
few
stones
to
trickle
into
his
hand
and
then
without
stopping
to
replace
them
dashed
stones
and
bag
into
his
pocket
the
door
along
the
corridor
crashed
open
what
that
he
gasped
out
in
fright
and
sprang
for
the
ladder
that
led
up
to
the
roof
it
had
all
taken
perhaps
the
minute
that
he
had
counted
on
no
more
noises
came
from
the
floors
below
now
a
confusion
of
them
the
shot
the
scream
had
been
heard
by
others
save
those
who
had
been
in
the
locked
room
and
the
latter
were
outside
now
in
the
corridor
running
to
their
accomplice
aid
there
was
a
pause
at
the
outer
door
then
an
oath
and
coupled
with
the
oath
an
exclamation
the
gray
seal
they
had
swept
a
flashlight
over
the
door
panel
jimmie
dale
halfway
up
the
ladder
smiled
grimly
the
door
opened
there
was
a
rush
of
feet
the
man
with
the
shattered
wrist
yelled
cursing
wildly
here
he
is
on
the
ladder
let
him
have
it
fill
him
full
of
holes
jimmie
dale
was
in
the
light
they
were
in
the
dark
of
the
outer
room
he
fired
at
the
threshold
checking
their
rush
as
a
hail
of
bullets
chipped
and
tore
at
the
ladder
and
spat
wickedly
against
the
wall
he
swung
through
to
the
roof
trying
as
he
did
so
to
kick
the
ladder
loose
behind
him
it
was
fastened
the
three
gunmen
jumped
into
the
room
from
the
roof
jimmie
dale
got
a
glimpse
of
them
below
as
he
flung
himself
clear
of
the
opening
bullets
whistled
through
the
aperture
a
voice
roared
up
as
he
gained
his
feet
come
on
after
him
the
whole
place
is
alive
but
this
lets
us
out
we
can
frame
up
how
we
came
to
be
here
easy
enough
never
mind
the
old
geezer
there
any
more
get
the
gray
seal
the
reward
that
out
for
him
is
worth
twice
the
sparklers
and
jimmie
dale
hurled
the
cover
over
the
scuttle
he
could
have
stood
them
off
from
above
and
kept
the
ladder
clear
with
his
revolver
but
the
alarm
seemed
general
now
windows
were
opening
voices
were
calling
to
one
another
from
the
windows
across
the
street
he
must
stand
out
in
sharp
outline
against
the
sky
yes
he
was
seen
now
a
woman
voice
from
a
window
across
the
street
screamed
out
in
excitement
there
he
is
there
he
is
on
the
roof
there
jimmie
dale
started
on
the
run
along
the
roof
the
houses
built
wall
to
wall
seemed
to
offer
an
open
course
ahead
of
him
until
a
lane
or
an
intersecting
street
should
bar
his
way
but
they
were
not
quite
all
on
the
same
level
though
the
wall
of
the
next
house
rose
suddenly
breast
high
in
front
of
him
he
flung
himself
up
regained
his
feet
and
ducked
instantly
behind
a
chimney
the
crack
of
a
revolver
echoed
through
the
night
a
bullet
drummed
through
the
air
the
skeeter
and
his
gang
were
on
the
roof
now
dashing
forward
firing
as
they
ran
two
shots
from
jimmie
dale
automatic
in
quick
succession
cooled
the
ardour
of
their
rush
and
they
broke
black
flitting
forms
for
the
shelter
of
chimneys
too
and
now
the
whole
neighbourhood
seemed
awakened
a
roar
as
from
some
great
gulf
below
rolled
up
from
the
street
a
medley
of
slamming
windows
the
rush
of
feet
as
people
poured
from
the
houses
cries
shouts
and
yells
and
high
over
all
the
shrill
call
of
the
whistle
and
the
crack
crack
crack
of
the
revolver
shots
the
skeeter
and
his
hellhounds
for
once
allies
of
the
law
twice
again
jimmie
dale
fired
then
crouching
running
low
he
zigzagged
his
way
across
the
next
roof
the
bullets
followed
him
once
more
his
pursuers
dashed
forward
and
again
jimmie
dale
his
face
set
like
stone
now
his
breath
coming
in
hard
gasps
dodged
behind
a
chimney
and
with
his
gun
checked
their
rush
for
the
third
time
he
glanced
about
him
and
with
a
growing
sense
of
disaster
saw
that
two
houses
farther
on
the
stretch
of
roof
appeared
to
end
there
would
be
a
lane
or
a
street
there
and
in
another
minute
or
two
if
it
were
not
already
the
case
others
would
be
following
the
gunmen
to
the
roof
and
then
he
would
be
he
caught
his
breath
suddenly
in
a
queer
little
strangled
cry
of
relief
just
back
of
him
a
few
yards
away
his
eyes
made
out
what
in
the
darkness
seemed
to
be
a
glass
skylight
a
dark
form
sped
like
a
deeper
shadow
across
the
black
in
front
of
him
making
for
a
chimney
nearer
by
closing
in
the
range
jimmie
dale
fired
wide
tight
as
was
the
corner
he
was
in
little
as
was
the
mercy
deserved
at
his
hands
he
could
not
after
all
bring
himself
to
shoot
to
kill
a
voice
the
skeeter
bawled
out
raucously
rush
him
all
together
from
different
sides
at
once
a
backward
leap
jimmie
dale
boot
was
crashing
glass
and
frame
stamping
at
it
desperately
making
a
hole
for
his
body
through
the
skylight
a
yell
a
chorus
of
them
answered
this
then
the
crunch
of
racing
feet
on
the
gravel
roof
he
emptied
his
revolver
sweeping
the
darkness
with
a
semicircle
of
vicious
flashes
it
seemed
an
hour
it
was
barely
the
fraction
of
a
second
as
he
hung
by
his
hands
from
the
side
of
the
skylight
frame
his
body
swinging
back
and
forth
in
the
unknown
blackness
below
the
skylight
might
be
probably
was
directly
over
the
stair
well
and
open
clear
to
the
basement
of
the
house
but
it
was
his
only
chance
he
swung
his
body
well
out
let
go
and
dropped
with
the
impetus
he
smashed
against
a
wall
was
flung
back
from
it
in
a
sort
of
rebound
and
his
hands
closed
gripping
fiercely
on
banisters
it
had
been
the
stair
well
beyond
any
question
of
doubt
but
his
swing
had
sent
him
clear
of
it
above
they
had
not
yet
reached
the
skylight
jimmie
dale
snatched
a
precious
moment
to
listen
as
he
rose
and
found
himself
apart
from
bruises
perhaps
unhurt
there
was
commotion
too
in
this
house
below
the
alarm
had
extended
and
spread
along
the
block
but
the
commotion
was
all
in
the
front
of
the
house
the
street
was
the
lure
jimmie
dale
started
down
the
stairs
and
in
an
instant
he
had
gained
the
landing
in
another
he
had
slipped
to
the
rear
of
the
hall
somewhere
there
from
the
hall
itself
from
one
of
the
rear
rooms
there
must
be
an
exit
to
the
fire
escape
to
attempt
to
leave
by
the
front
way
was
certain
capture
they
were
yelling
shouting
down
now
through
the
above
as
jimmie
dale
softly
raised
the
window
sash
at
the
rear
of
the
hall
the
fire
escape
was
there
shouts
from
along
the
corridor
from
the
tenement
dwellers
who
had
been
crowding
their
neighbours
rooms
craning
their
necks
probably
from
the
front
windows
answered
the
shouts
now
from
the
roof
and
the
skylight
doors
opened
forms
rushed
out
but
it
was
dark
in
the
corridor
only
a
murky
yellow
at
the
upper
end
from
the
opened
doors
jimmie
dale
slipped
through
the
window
to
the
fire
escape
and
working
cautiously
silently
but
with
the
speed
of
a
trained
athlete
made
his
way
down
at
the
bottom
he
dropped
from
the
iron
platform
into
the
back
yard
ran
for
the
fence
and
climbed
over
into
a
lane
on
the
other
side
and
then
as
he
ran
jimmie
dale
snatched
the
mask
from
his
face
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
he
was
safe
now
he
swept
the
sweat
drops
from
his
forehead
with
the
back
of
his
hand
noticing
them
for
the
first
time
it
had
been
close
almost
as
close
for
him
as
it
had
been
for
old
luddy
and
the
papers
would
execrate
the
gray
seal
he
smiled
a
little
wanly
his
breath
was
still
coming
hard
presently
they
would
scour
the
lane
when
they
found
that
their
quarry
was
not
in
the
house
what
a
racket
they
were
making
the
whole
district
seemed
roused
like
a
swarm
of
angry
bees
he
kept
on
along
the
lane
and
dodged
suddenly
into
a
cross
street
where
the
two
intersected
the
clang
of
a
bell
dinned
discordantly
in
his
ears
a
patrol
wagon
swept
by
him
racing
for
the
scene
of
the
disturbance
the
riot
call
was
out
again
jimmie
dale
smiled
wearily
passing

across

eyes

said
jimmie
dale
i
pretty
near
all
in
and
i
guess
time
that
larry
the
bat
went
and
a
little
later
a
figure
turned
from
the
bowery
and
shambled
down
the
cross
street
a
disreputable
figure
with
hands
plunged
deep
in
his
pockets
and
a
shadow
across
the
roadway
suddenly
shifted
its
position
as
the
shambling
figure
slouched
into
the
black
alleyway
and
entered
the
tenement
side
door
and
larry
the
bat
smiled
softly
to
himself
kline
men
were
still
on
guard
chapter
vi
devil
work
a
arm
a
voice
and
a
silvery
laugh
just
that
no
more
jimmie
dale
in
his
favourite
seat
an
aisle
seat
some
seven
or
eight
rows
back
from
the
orchestra
stared
at
the
stage
to
all
outward
appearances
absorbed
in
the
last
act
of
the
play
inwardly
quite
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
even
a
play
was
going
on
a
arm
a
voice
and
a
silvery
laugh
the
words
had
formed
themselves
into
a
sort
of
singsong
refrain
that
for
the
last
few
days
had
been
running
through
his
head
a
strange
enough
guiding
star
to
mould
and
dictate
every
action
in
his
life
and
that
was
all
he
had
ever
seen
of
her
all
that
he
had
ever
heard
of
her
except
those
letters
of
course
each
of
which
had
outlined
the
details
of
some
affair
for
the
gray
seal
to
execute
indeed
it
seemed
a
great
length
of
time
now
since
he
had
heard
from
her
even
in
that
way
though
it
was
not
so
many
days
ago
after
all
perhaps
it
was
the
calm
as
it
were
that
by
contrast
had
given
place
to
the
strenuous
months
and
weeks
just
past
the
storm
raised
by
the
newspapers
at
the
theft
of
old
luddy
diamonds
had
subsided
into
sporadic
diatribes
aimed
at
the
police
kline
of
the
secret
service
had
finally
admitted
defeat
and
a
shadow
no
longer
skulked
day
and
night
at
the
entrance
to
the
sanctuary
and
larry
the
bat
bore
the
government
indorsement
so
to
speak
of
being
no
more
suspicious
a
character
than
that
of
a
disreputable
but
harmless
dope
fiend
of
the
underworld
larry
the
bat
the
gray
seal
jimmie
dale
the
millionaire
what
if
it
were
ever
known
that
that
strange
three
were
one
what
if
jimmie
dale
smiled
whimsically
a
burst
of
applause
echoed
through
the
house
the
orchestra
was
playing
the
lights
were
on
seats
banged
there
was
the
bustle
of
the
rising
audience
the
play
was
at
an
end
and
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
have
remembered
a
single
line
of
the
last
act
the
aisle
at
his
elbow
was
already
crowded
with
people
on
their
way
out
jimmie
dale
stooped
down
mechanically
to
reach
for
his
hat
beneath
his
seat
and
the
next
instant
he
was
standing
up
staring
wildly
into
the
faces
around
him
it
had
fallen
at
his
feet
a
white
envelope
hers
it
was
in
his
hand
now
those
slim
tapering
wonderfully
sensitive
fingers
of
jimmie
dale
that
were
an
open
sesame
to
locks
and
safes
subconsciously
telegraphing
to
his
mind
the
fact
that
the
texture
of
the
paper
was
hers
hers
and
she
must
be
one
of
those
around
him
one
of
those
crowding
either
the
row
of
seats
in
front
or
behind
or
one
of
those
just
passing
in
the
aisle
it
had
fallen
at
his
feet
as
he
had
stooped
over
for
his
hat
but
from
just
exactly
what
direction
he
could
not
tell
his
eyes
eagerly
hungrily
critically
swept
face
after
face
which
one
was
hers
what
irony
she
whom
he
would
have
given
his
life
to
know
for
whom
indeed
he
risked
his
life
every
hour
of
the
was
close
to
him
now
within
reach
and
as
far
removed
as
though
a
thousand
miles
separated
them
she
was
there
but
he
could
not
recognise
a
face
that
he
had
never
seen
with
an
effort
he
choked
back
the
bitter
impotent
laugh
that
rose
to
his
lips
they
were
talking
laughing
around
him
her
voice
yes
he
had
once
heard
that
and
that
he
would
recognise
again
he
strained
to
catch
to
individualise
the
tone
sounds
that
floated
in
a
medley
about
him
it
was
useless
of
course
every
effort
that
he
had
ever
made
to
find
her
had
been
useless
she
was
too
clever
far
too
clever
for
that
she
too
would
know
that
he
could
and
would
recognise
her
voice
where
he
could
recognise
nothing
else
and
then
suddenly
he
realised
that
he
was
attracting
attention
level
stares
from
the
women
returned
his
gaze
and
they
edged
away
a
little
from
his
vicinity
as
they
passed
their
escorts
crowding
somewhat
belligerently
into
their
places
others
in
the
same
row
of
seats
as
his
own
were
impatiently
waiting
to
get
by
him
with
a
muttered
apology
jimmie
dale
raised
the
seat
of
his
chair
allowing
these
latter
to
pass
him
and
then
slipping
the
letter
into
his
pocketbook
he
snatched
up
his
hat
from
the
seat
rack
there
was
still
a
chance
knowing
he
was
there
she
would
be
on
her
guard
but
in
the
lobby
among
the
crowd
and
unaware
of
his
presence
there
was
the
possibility
that
if
he
could
reach
the
entrance
ahead
of
her
she
too
might
be
talking
and
laughing
as
she
left
the
theatre
just
a
single
word
just
a
tone
that
was
all
he
asked
the
row
of
seats
at
whose
end
he
stood
was
empty
now
and
instead
of
stepping
into
the
thronged
aisle
he
made
his
way
across
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
theatre
here
the
far
aisle
was
less
crowded
and
in
a
minute
he
had
gained
the
foyer
confident
that
he
was
now
in
advance
of
her
the
next
moment
he
was
lost
in
a
jam
of
people
in
the
lobby
he
moved
slowly
now
very
slowly
allowing
those
behind
to
press
by
him
on
the
way
to
the
entrance
a
babel
of
voices
rose
about
him
as
the
mass
of
people
jostled
elbowed
and
pushed
it
was
a
voice
now
her
voice
that
he
was
listening
for
but
though
it
seemed
that
every
faculty
was
strained
and
intent
upon
that
one
effort
his
eyes
too
had
in
no
degree
relaxed
their
vigilance
and
once
half
grimly
half
sardonically
he
smiled
to
himself
there
would
be
an
unexpected
aftermath
to
this
exodus
of
expensively
gowned
and
bejewelled
women
with
their
prosperous
escorts
there
was
the
wowzer
over
there
sleek
dapper
squirming
in
and
out
of
the
throng
with
the
agility
and
stealth
of
a
cat
as
larry
the
bat
he
had
met
the
wowzer
many
times
as
indeed
he
had
met
and
was
acquainted
with
most
of
the
elite
of
the
underworld
the
wowzer
beyond
a
shadow
of
doubt
in
his
own
profession
stood
upon
a
plane
entirely
by
himself
among
those
qualified
to
speak
no
one
yet
had
ever
questioned
the
wowzer
claim
to
the
distinction
of
being
the
most
dexterous
and
finished
poke
getter
in
the
united
states
the
crowd
thinned
in
the
lobby
thinned
down
to
the
last
few
belated
stragglers
who
passed
him
as
he
still
loitered
in
the
entrance
and
then
jimmie
dale
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
that
was
a
great
deal
more
philosophical
than
the
maddening
sense
of
chagrin
and
disappointment
that
burned
within
him
stepped
out
to
the
pavement
and
headed
down
broadway
after
all
he
had
known
it
in
his
heart
of
hearts
all
the
time
it
had
always
been
the
same
it
was
only
one
more
occasion
added
to
the
innumerable
ones
that
had
gone
before
in
which
she
had
eluded
him
and
now
there
was
the
letter
automatically
he
quickened
his
steps
a
little
it
was
useless
futile
profitless
for
the
moment
at
least
to
disturb
himself
over
his
failure
there
was
the
letter
his
lips
parted
in
a
strange
smile
the
letter
that
was
paramount
now
what
new
venture
did
the
night
hold
in
store
for
him
what
sudden
emergency
was
the
gray
seal
called
upon
to
face
this
time
what
role
unrehearsed
without
warning
must
he
play
what
story
of
grim
desperate
rascality
would
the
papers
credit
him
with
when
daylight
came
or
would
they
carry
in
screaming
headlines
the
announcement
that
the
gray
seal
was
caged
and
caught
at
last
and
in
type
tell
the
world
that
the
gray
seal
was
jimmie
dale
a
block
down
he
turned
from
broadway
out
of
the
theatre
crowds
that
streamed
in
both
directions
past
him
the
letter
almost
feverishly
now
he
was
seeking
an
opportunity
to
open
and
read
it
unobserved
an
eagerness
upon
him
that
mingled
exhilaration
at
the
lure
of
danger
with
a
sense
of
premonition
that
irritably
inevitably
was
with
him
at
moments
such
as
these
it
seemed
it
always
seemed
that
with
an
unopened
letter
of
hers
in
his
possession
it
was
as
though
he
were
about
to
open
a
page
in
the
book
of
fate
and
read
as
it
were
a
pronouncement
upon
himself
that
might
mean
life
or
death
he
hurried
on
people
still
passed
by
him
too
many
and
then
a
cafe
just
ahead
making
a
corner
gave
him
the
opportunity
that
he
sought
away
from
the
entrance
on
the
side
street
the
brilliant
lights
from
the
windows
shone
out
on
a
comparatively
deserted
pavement
there
was
ample
light
to
read
by
even
as
far
away
from
the
window
as
the
curb
and
jimmie
dale
with
an
approving
nod
turned
the
corner
and
walked
along
a
few
steps
until
opposite
the
farthest
window
but
as
he
halted
here
at
the
edge
of
the
street
he
glanced
quickly
behind
him
at
a
man
whom
he
had
just
passed
the
other
had
paused
at
the
corner
and
was
staring
down
the
street
jimmie
dale
instantly
and
nonchalantly
produced
his
cigarette
case
selected
a
cigarette
and
fastidiously
tapped
its
end
on
his
thumb
nail
inspector
burton
in
plain
clothes
he
observed
musingly
to
himself
i
wonder
if
it
just
a
fluke
or
something
else
we
jimmie
dale
took
a
box
of
matches
from
his
pocket
the
first
would
not
light
the
second
broke
and
with
an
exclamation
of
annoyance
he
flung
it
away
the
third
was
making
a
fitful
effort
at
life
as
another
man
emerged
hastily
from
the
cafe
side
door
hurried
to
the
corner
joined
the
man
who
was
still
loitering
there
and
both
together
disappeared
at
a
rapid
pace
down
the
street
jimmie
dale
whistled
softly
to
himself
the
second
man
was
even
better
known
than
the
first
there
was
not
a
crook
in
new
york
but
would
lannigan
of
headquarters
and
do
it
with
amazing
celerity
if
he
could
something
up
but
it
not
my
hunt
muttered
jimmie
dale
then
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
queer
the
way
those
headquarters
chaps
fascinate
and
give
me
a
thrill
every
time
i
see
them
even
if
i
a
ghost
of
a
reason
for
imagining
that
the
sentence
was
never
finished
jimmie
dale
face
was
gray
the
street
seemed
to
rock
about
him
and
he
stared
like
a
man
stricken
white
to
the
lips
ahead
of
him
the
letter
was
gone
his
hand
wriggling
from
his
empty
pocket
swept
away
the
sweat
beads
that
were
bursting
from
his
forehead
it
had
come
at
last
the
pitcher
had
gone
once
too
often
to
the
well
numbed
for
an
instant
his
brain
cleared
now
working
with
lightning
speed
leaping
from
premise
to
conclusion
the
crush
in
the
theatre
lobby
the
pushing
the
jostling
the
close
contact
the
wowzer
the
slickest
cleverest
pickpocket
in
the
united
states
for
a
moment
he
could
have
laughed
aloud
in
a
sort
of
ghastly
defiant
mockery
he
himself
had
predicted
an
unexpected
aftermath
had
he
not
aftermath
it
was
the
end
an
hour
two
hours
and
new
york
would
be
metamorphosed
into
a
seething
caldron
of
humanity
bubbling
with
the
news
it
seemed
that
he
could
hear
the
screams
of
the
newsboys
now
shouting
their
extras
it
seemed
that
he
could
see
the
people
roused
to
frenzy
swarming
in
excited
crowds
snatching
at
the
papers
he
seemed
to
hear
the
mob
shouts
swell
in
execration
in
exultation
it
seemed
as
though
all
around
him
had
gone
mad
the
mystery
of
the
gray
seal
was
solved
it
was
jimmie
dale
jimmie
dale
jimmie
dale
the
millionaire
the
lion
of
society
and
there
was
ignominy
for
an
honoured
name
and
shame
and
disaster
and
convict
stripes
and
sullen
penitentiary
walls
or
death
a
felon
death
the
chair
he
was
running
now
his
hands
clenched
at
his
sides
his
mind
working
subconsciously
urging
him
onward
in
a
blind
as
yet
unrealised
objectless
way
and
then
gradually
impulse
gave
way
to
calmer
reason
and
he
slowed
his
pace
to
a
quick
less
noticeable
walk
the
wowzer
that
was
it
there
was
yet
a
chance
the
wowzer
a
merciless
rage
cold
deadly
settled
upon
him
it
was
the
wowzer
who
had
stolen
his
pocketbook
and
with
it
the
letter
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
well
there
would
be
a
reckoning
at
least
before
the
end
he
was
in
a
downtown
subway
train
now
the
roar
in
his
ears
in
consonance
it
seemed
with
the
turmoil
in
his
brain
but
now
too
he
was
jimmie
dale
again
and
apart
from
the
slightly
outthrust
jaw
the
lips
impassive
debonair
composed
there
was
yet
a
chance
as
larry
the
bat
he
knew
every
den
and
lair
below
the
dead
line
and
he
knew
too
the
wowzer
favourite
haunts
there
was
yet
a
chance
only
one
in
a
thousand
it
was
true
almost
too
pitiful
to
be
depended
upon
but
yet
a
chance
the
wowzer
had
probably
not
worked
alone
and
he
and
his
pal
or
pals
would
certainly
not
remain
uptown
either
to
examine
or
divide
their
spoils
they
would
wait
until
they
were
safe
somewhere
in
one
of
their
hell
holes
on
the
east
side
if
he
could
find
the
wowzer
reach
the
man
before
the
letter
was
opened
jimmie
dale
lips
grew
tighter
that
was
the
chance
it
he
failed
in
that
jimmie
dale
lips
drooped
downward
in
grim
curves
at
the
corners
a
chance
already
the
wowzer
had
at
least
a
half
lead
and
worse
still
there
was
no
telling
which
one
of
a
dozen
places
the
man
might
have
chosen
to
retreat
to
with
his
loot
time
passed
his
mind
obsessed
jimmie
dale
physical
acts
were
almost
wholly
mechanical
it
was
perhaps
fifteen
minutes
since
he
had
discovered
the
loss
of
the
letter
and
he
was
walking
now
through
the
heart
of
the
bowery
exactly
how
he
had
got
there
he
could
not
have
told
he
had
only
a
vague
realisation
that
following
an
intuitive
sense
of
direction
he
had
lost
not
a
second
of
time
in
making
his
way
downtown
and
now
he
found
himself
hesitating
at
the
corner
of
a
cross
street
two
blocks
east
was
that
dark
narrow
alleyway
that
side
door
that
made
the
entrance
to
the
sanctuary
it
would
be
safer
a
hundred
times
safer
to
go
there
change
his
clothes
and
his
personality
and
emerge
again
as
larry
the
bat
infinitely
safer
in
that
role
to
explore
the
dens
of
the
underworld
many
of
them
indeed
unknown
and
undreamed
of
by
the
police
themselves
than
to
trust
himself
there
in
fashionable
tweeds
but
that
would
take
time
time
when
with
every
second
the
one
chance
he
had
desperate
as
that
already
was
was
slipping
away
from
him
no
what
was
apparently
the
greater
risk
at
least
held
out
the
only
hope
he
went
on
again
his
brain
incessantly
at
work
at
the
worst
there
was
one
mitigating
factor
in
it
all
he
had
no
need
to
think
of
her
whatever
the
ruin
and
disaster
that
faced
him
in
the
next
few
hours
she
in
any
case
was
safe
there
was
no
clew
to
her
identity
in
the
letter
and
where
he
for
months
on
end
with
even
more
to
work
upon
had
failed
at
every
turn
to
trace
her
there
was
little
fear
that
any
one
else
would
have
any
better
success
she
was
safe
as
for
himself
that
was
different
the
gray
seal
would
be
referred
to
in
the
letter
there
would
be
the
outline
the
data
for
the
crime
she
had
planned
for
that
night
and
the
letter
though
unaddressed
being
found
in
his
pocketbook
where
cards
and
notes
and
a
dozen
different
things
among
its
contents
proclaimed
him
jimmie
dale
needed
no
further
evidence
as
to
its
ownership
nor
the
identity
of
the
gray
seal
jimmie
dale
fingers
crept
inside
his
vest
and
fumbled
there
for
a
moment
and
a
diamond
stud
extracted
from
his
shirt
front
glistened
sportively
in
the
necktie
that
was
now
tucked
jauntily
in
at
one
side
of
his
shirt
bosom
he
had
reached
the
blue
dragon
one
of
wowzer
usual
hang
outs
and
swerving
from
the
sidewalk
entered
the
place
there
was
wild
tumult
within
a
constant
storm
of
applause
derision
and
hilarity
that
was
hurled
from
the
tables
around
the
room
at
the
couples
on
the
somewhat
restricted
space
of
polished
hardwood
flooring
in
the
centre
jimmie
dale
swaggered
down
the
room
a
cigar
tilted
up
at
an
angle
between
his
teeth
his
soft
felt
hat
a
little
rakishly
on
one
side
of
his
head
and
well
over
his
nose
at
the
end
of
the
room
at
the
bar
jimmie
dale
leaned
toward
the
barkeeper
and
talked
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
there
were
private
rooms
upstairs
and
he
jerked
his
head
surreptitiously
ceilingward
say

de
wowzer
up
dere
he
inquired
in
a
cautious
whisper
the
man
behind
the
bar
well
known
to
jimmie
dale
as
one
of
the
particular
pals
favoured
him
with
a
blank
stare
never

he
announced
brusquely
wot

a
mug
of
suds
said
jimmie
dale
reaching
for
a
match
he
puffed
at
his
cigar
blew
out
the
match
and
after
a
moment
flung
the
charred
end
away
but
on
his
hand
as
palm
outward
he
raised
it
to
take
his
glass
the
match
had
traced
a
small
black
cross
the
barkeeper
put
down
the
beer
he
had
just
drawn
wiped
his
hand
hurriedly
and
with
sudden
enthusiasm
thrust
it
across
the
bar
glad
to
know

exclaimed

cordially

jimmie

gratefully
as
he
turned
away
so
long
then
see
youse
chang
foo
jimmie
dale
face
set
even
a
little
harder
than
it
had
before
as
he
swung
on
again
down
the
bowery
yes
he
knew
chang
foo
too
well
underground
chinatown
where
a
man
life
was
worth
the
price
of
an
opium
pill
or
less
mechanically
his
hand
slipped
into
his
pocket
and
closed
over
the
automatic
that
nestled
there
once
in
where
he
had
to
go
and
the
chances
were
even
just
even
that
was
all
that
he
would
ever
get
out
again
he
was
tempted
to
return
to
the
sanctuary
and
make
the
attempt
as
larry
the
bat
larry
the
bat
was
well
enough
known
to
enter
chang
foo
unquestioned
and
but
again
he
shook
his
head
and
went
on
there
was
not
time
the
wowzer
and
his
pal
it
was
dago
jim
it
seemed
had
evidently
been
drinking
and
loitering
their
way
downtown
from
the
theatre
and
he
had
gained
that
much
on
them
but
by
now
they
would
be
smugly
tucked
away
somewhere
in
that
maze
of
dens
below
the
ground
and
at
that
moment
probably
were
gloating
over
the
biggest
night
haul
they
had
ever
made
in
their
lives
and
if
they
were
what
then
once
they
knew
the
contents
of
that
letter
what
then
buy
them
off
for
a
larger
amount
than
the
many
thousands
offered
for
the
capture
of
the
gray
seal
jimmie
dale
gritted
his
teeth
that
meant
blackmail
from
them
all
his
life
an
intolerable
existence
impossible
a
hell
on
earth
the
slave
at
the
beck
and
call
of
two
of
the
worst
criminals
in
new
york
the
moisture
oozed
again
to
jimmie
dale
forehead
god
if
he
could
get
that
letter
before
it
was
opened
before
they
knew
if
he
could
only
get
the
chance
to
fight
for
it
against
any
odds
life
life
was
a
pitiful
consideration
against
the
alternative
that
faced
him
now
from
the
blue
dragon
to
chang
foo
was
not
far
and
jimmie
dale
covered
the
distance
in
well
under
five
minutes
chang
foo
was
just
a
tea
merchant
shop
innocuous
and
innocent
enough
in
its
appearance
blandly
so
indeed
and
that
was
all
outwardly
but
jimmie
dale
as
he
reached
his
destination
experienced
the
first
sensation
of
uplift
he
had
known
that
night
and
this
from
what
apparently
did
not
in
the
least
seem
like
a
contributing
cause
luck
the
blessed
luck
of
it
he
muttered
grimly
as
he
surveyed
the
car
drawn
up
at
the
curb
and
watched
the
passengers
crowding
out
of
it
to
the
ground
it
would
have
been
as
easy
to
fool
old
chang
as
it
was
that
fellow
back
at
the
dragon
and
besides
if
i
can
work
it
there
a
better
chance
this
way
of
getting
out
the
guide
was
marshalling
his
gapers
some
two
dozen
in
all
men
and
women
jimmie
dale
unostentatiously
fell
in
at
the
rear
and
the
guide
leading
the
little
crowd
passed
into
the
tea
merchant
shop
chang
foo
a
wizened
little
celestial
oily
suave
greeted
them
with
profuse
bows
chattering
the
while
volubly
in
chinese
the
guide
made
the
introduction
with
an
sweep
of
his
hand
chang
foo
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
announced
then
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
impressively
this
is
one
of
the
most
notorious
if
not
the
most
notorious
dive
in
chinatown
and
it
is
only
through
special
arrangement
with
the
authorities
and
at
great
expense
that
the
company
is
able
exclusively
to
gain
an
entree
here
for
its
patrons
you
will
see
here
the
real
life
of
the
chinese
and
in
half
an
hour
you
will
get
what
few
would
get
in
a
lifetime
spent
in
china
itself
you
will
see
the
chinese
children
dance
and
perform
the
chinese
women
at
their
household
tasks
the
joss
the
shrine
of
his
hallowed
ancestors
at
which
chang
foo
here
worships
and
you
will
enter
the
most
famous
opium
den
in
the
united
states
now
if
you
will
all
keep
close
together
we
will
make
a
in
spite
of
his
desperate
situation
jimmie
dale
smiled
a
little
whimsically
yes
they
would
see
it
all
upstairs
the
same
old
bunk
dished
out
night
after
night
at
so
much
a
head
and
the
nervous
little
of
uncertain
age
who
fidgeted
now
beside
him
would
go
back
somewhere
down
in
maine
and
shiver
while
she
related
her
wider
experiences
in
tremulous
whispers
into
the
shocked
ears
of
envious
other
maiden
ladies
of
equally
uncertain
age
the
same
old
bunk
and
a
profitable
one
for
chang
foo
for
more
reasons
than
one
it
was
dust
in
the
eyes
of
the
police
the
police
smiled
knowingly
at
mention
of
chang
foo
who
should
know
if
they
did
that
it
was
all
harmless
fake
all
bunk
and
so
it
was
upstairs
they
were
passing
out
of
the
shop
now
bowed
out
through
a
side
door
by
the
obsequious
and
oily
chang
foo
and
now
they
massed
again
in
a
sort
of
little
hallway
and
chang
foo
closing
the
door
upon
jimmie
dale
who
was
the
last
in
the
line
shuffled
back
behind
the
counter
in
his
shop
to
resume
his
guard
duty
over
customers
of
quite
another
ilk
with
the
door
closed
it
was
dark
pitch
dark
and
this
too
like
everything
else
connected
with
chang
foo
establishment
for
more
reasons
than
one
for
effect
and
for
security
nervous
little
twitters
began
to
emanate
from
the
women
the
guide
voice
rose
reassuringly
keep
close
together
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
are
going
upstairs
now
to
jimmie
dale
hugged
back
against
the
wall
sidled
along
it
and
like
a
shadow
slipped
down
to
the
end
of
the
hall
the
scuffling
of
two
dozen
pairs
of
feet
mounting
the
creaky
staircase
drowned
the
slight
sound
as
he
cautiously
opened
a
door
the
darkness
lay
black
impenetrable
along
the
hall
and
then
as
cautiously
as
he
had
opened
it
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
stood
for
an
instant
listening
at
the
head
of
a
stairway
his
automatic
in
his
hand
now
it
was
familiar
ground
to
larry
the
bat
the
steps
led
down
to
a
cellar
and
diagonally
across
from
the
foot
of
the
steps
was
an
opening
ingeniously
hidden
by
a
heterogeneous
collection
of
odds
and
ends
boxes
cases
and
rubbish
from
the
pseudo
tea
shop
above
a
low
opening
in
the
wall
to
a
passage
that
led
on
through
the
cellars
of
perhaps
half
a
dozen
adjoining
houses
each
of
which
latter
was
leased
in
one
name
or
another
by
chang
foo
jimmie
dale
crept
down
the
steps
and
in
another
moment
had
gained
the
farther
side
of
the
cellar
then
skirting
around
the
ruck
of
cases
he
stooped
suddenly
and
passed
in
through
the
opening
in
the
wall
and
now
he
halted
once
more
he
was
straining
his
eyes
down
a
long
narrow
passage
whose
blackness
was
accentuated
rather
than
relieved
by
curious
wavering
gossamer
threads
of
yellow
light
that
showed
here
and
there
from
under
makeshift
thresholds
from
doors
slightly
ajar
faint
noises
came
to
him
a
muffled
intermittent
clink
of
coin
a
low
continuous
droning
hum
of
voices
the
sickly
sweet
smell
of
opium
pricked
at
his
nostrils
jimmie
dale
face
set
rigidly
it
was
the
resort
not
only
of
the
most
depraved
chinese
element
but
of
the
worst
white
thugs
that
made
new
york
their
headquarters
here
in
the
succession
of
cellars
roughly
partitioned
off
to
make
a
dozen
rooms
on
either
side
of
the
passage
dope
fiends
sucked
at
the
drug
and
chinese
gamblers
spent
the
greater
part
of
their
lives
here
murder
was
hatched
and
played
too
often
to
its
hellish
end
here
the
scum
of
the
underworld
sought
refuge
from
the
police
to
the
profit
of
chang
foo
and
here
somewhere
in
one
of
these
rooms
was
the
wowzer
the
wowzer
jimmie
dale
stole
forward
silently
without
a
sound
swiftly
pausing
only
to
listen
for
a
second
space
at
the
doors
as
he
passed
from
this
one
came
that
clink
of
coin
from
another
that
jabber
of
chinese
from
still
another
that
overpowering
stench
of
opium
and
once
as
he
was
a
cold
thrill
passed
over
him
let
this
lair
of
hell
wolves
so
intent
now
on
their
own
affairs
be
once
roused
as
they
certainly
must
be
roused
before
he
could
hope
to
finish
the
wowzer
and
his
chances
of
escape
were
he
straightened
suddenly
alert
tense
strained
voices
raised
in
a
furious
quarrel
came
from
a
door
just
beyond
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
passage
where
a
film
of
light
streamed
out
through
a
cracked
panel
it
was
the
wowzer
and
dago
jim
and
drunk
both
of
them
and
both
in
a
blind
fury
it
happened
quick
then
almost
instantaneously
it
seemed
to
jimmie
dale
he
was
crouched
now
close
against
the
door
his
eye
to
the
crack
in
the
panel
there
was
only
one
figure
in
sight
dago
jim
standing
beside
a
table
on
which
burned
a
lamp
the
table
top
littered
with
watches
purses
and
small
chatelaine
bags
the
man
was
lurching
unsteadily
on
his
feet
a
vicious
sneer
of
triumph
on
his
face
waving
tauntingly
an
open
letter
and
jimmie
dale
in
his
hands
waving
them
presumably
in
the
face
of
the
wowzer
whom
from
the
restrictions
of
the
crack
jimmie
dale
could
not
see
he
was
conscious
of
a
sickening
sense
of
disaster
his
hope
against
hope
had
been
in
vain
the
letter
had
been
opened
and
read
the
identity
of
the
gray
seal
was
solved

to
red
lurid
red
a
stream
of
flame
seemed
to
cut
across
jimmie
line
of
vision
came
the
roar
of
a
revolver
shot
and
like
a
madman
jimmie
dale
flung
his
body
at
the
door
rickety
at
best
it
crashed
inward
half
wrenched
from
its
hinges
precipitating
him
inside
he
recovered
himself
and
leaped
forward
the
room
was
swirling
with
blue
eddies
of
smoke
dago
jim
hands
flung
up
still
grasping
letter
and
pocketbook
pawed
at
the
air
and
plunged
with
a
sagging
lurch
face
downward
to
the
floor
there
was
a
yell
and
an
oath
from
the
wowzer
the
crack
of
another
revolver
shot
the
hum
of
the
bullet
past
jimmie
ear
the
scorch
of
the
tongue
flame
in
his
face
and
he
was
upon
the
other
screeching
profanity
the
wowzer
grappled
and
for
an
instant
the
two
men
rocked
reeled
and
swayed
in
each
other
embrace
then
both
men
losing
their
balance
they
shot
suddenly
backward
the
wowzer
undermost
striking
his
head
against
the
table
edge
and
men
table
and
lamp
crashed
downward
in
a
heap
to
the
floor
it
had
been
no
more
at
most
than
a
matter
of
seconds
since
jimmie
dale
had
hurled
himself
into
the
room
and
now
with
a
gurgling
sigh
the
wowzer
arms
that
had
been
wound
around
jimmie
dale
back
and
shoulders
relaxed
and
from
the
blow
on
his
head
the
man
lay
back
inert
and
stunned
and
then
it
seemed
to
jimmie
dale
as
though
pandemonium
unreality
and
chaos
at
the
touch
of
some
devil
hand
reigned
around
him
it
was
dark
no
not
dark
a
spurt
of
flame
was
leaping
along
the
line
of
trickling
oil
from
the
broken
lamp
on
the
floor
it
threw
into
ghastly
relief
the
sprawled
form
of
dago
jim
outside
from
along
the
passageway
came
a
confused
jangle
of
commotion
whispering
voices
shuffling
feet
the
swish
of
chinese
garments
and
the
room
itself
began
to
spring
into
weird
flickering
shadows
that
mounted
and
crept
up
the
walls
with
the
spreading
fire
there
was
not
a
second
to
lose
before
the
room
would
be
swarming
with
that
rush
from
the
passageway
and
there
was
still
the
letter
the
pocketbook
the
table
had
fallen
half
over
dago
jim
jimmie
dale
pushed
it
aside
tore
the
crushed
letter
and
the
pocketbook
from
the
hands
and
felt
with
a
grim
horrible
sort
of
anxiety
for
the
heartbeat
for
the
verdict
that
meant
life
or
death
to
himself
there
was
no
sign
of
life
the
man
was
dead
jimmie
dale
was
on
his
feet
now
a
face
another
and
another
showed
in
the
doorway
the
wowzer
was
regaining
his
senses
stumbling
to
his
knees
there
was
one
chance
just
one
to
take
those
crowding
figures
by
surprise
and
with
a
yell
of
fire
jimmie
dale
sprang
for
the
doorway
they
gave
way
before
his
rush
tumbling
back
in
their
surprise
against
the
opposite
wall
and
turning
jimmie
dale
raced
down
the
passageway
doors
were
opening
everywhere
now
forms
were
pushing
out
into
the
only
to
duck
hastily
back
again
as
jimmie
automatic
barked
and
spat
a
running
fire
of
warning
ahead
of
him
and
then
behind
the
wowzer
voice
shrieked
out
soak
him
kill
de
guy
he
croaked
dago
jim
put
a
hole
in
him
de
yells
a
chorus
of
them
took
up
the
refrain
then
the
rush
of
following
feet
and
the
passageway
seemed
to
racket
as
though
a
gatling
gun
were
in
play
with
the
fusillade
of
revolver
shots
but
jimmie
dale
was
at
the
opening
now
and
like
a
base
runner
plunging
for
the
bag
he
flung
himself
in
a
low
dive
through
and
into
the
open
cellar
beyond
he
was
on
his
feet
over
the
boxes
and
dashing
up
the
stairs
in
a
second
the
door
above
opened
as
he
reached
the
top
jimmie
dale
right
hand
shot
out
with
clubbed
revolver
and
with
a
grunt
chang
foo
went
down
before
the
blow
and
the
headlong
rush
the
next
instant
jimmie
dale
had
sprung
through
the
tea
shop
and
was
out
on
the
street
a
minute
two
minutes
more
and
chinatown
would
be
in
an
uproar
chang
foo
would
see
to
that
and
the
wowzer
would
prod
him
on
the
danger
was
far
from
over
yet
and
then
as
he
ran
jimmie
dale
gave
a
little
gasp
of
relief
just
ahead
drawn
up
at
the
curb
stood
a
taxicab
waiting
probably
for
a
private
slumming
party
jimmie
dale
put
on
a
spurt
reached
it
and
wrenched
the
door
open
quick
he
flung
at
the
startled
chauffeur
the
nearest
subway
station
there
a
in
it
for
you
quick
man
quick
here
they
come
a
crowd
of
chinese
pouring
like
angry
hornets
from
chang
foo
shop
came
yelling
down
the
street
and
the
taxi
took
the
corner
on
two
wheels
and
jimmie
dale
panting
choking
for
his
breath
like
a
man
spent
sank
back
against
the
cushions
but
five
minutes
later
it
was
quite
another
jimmie
dale
composed
nonchalant
imperturbable
who
entered
an
subway
train
and
choosing
a
seat
alone
near
the
centre
of
the
car
which
at
that
hour
of
night
in
the
downtown
district
was
almost
deserted
took
the
crushed
letter
from
his
pocket
for
a
moment
he
made
no
attempt
to
read
it
his
dark
eyes
now
that
he
was
free
from
observation
full
of
troubled
retrospect
fixed
on
the
window
at
his
side
it
was
not
a
pleasant
thought
that
it
had
cost
a
man
his
life
nor
yet
that
that
life
was
also
the
price
of
his
own
freedom
true
if
there
were
two
men
in
the
city
of
new
york
whose
crimes
merited
neither
sympathy
nor
mercy
those
two
men
were
the
wowzer
and
dago
jim
but
yet
after
all
it
was
a
human
life
and
even
if
his
own
had
been
in
the
balance
thank
god
it
had
been
through
no
act
of
his
that
dago
jim
had
gone
out
the
wowzer
cute
and
cunning
had
been
quick
enough
to
say
so
to
clear
himself
but
jimmie
dale
smiled
a
little
now
neither
the
wowzer
nor
chang
foo
nor
chinatown
would
ever
be
in
a
position
to
recognise
their
uninvited
guest
jimmie
dale
eyes
shifted
to
the
letter
speculatively
gravely
it
seemed
as
though
the
night
had
already
held
a
year
of
happenings
and
the
night
was
not
over
yet
there
was
the
letter
it
had
already
cost
one
life
was
it
to
cost
another
or
what
it
began
as
it
always
did
he
read
it
through
once
in
amazement
a
second
time
with
a
flush
of
bitter
anger
creeping
to
his
cheeks
and
a
third
time
curiously
memorising
as
it
were
snatches
of
it
here
and
there
dear

made

there
was
a
great
deal
more
four
sheets
of
closely
written
data
with
an
exclamation
almost
of
dismay
jimmie
dale
pulled
out
his
watch
so
that
was
what
burton
and
lannigan
were
up
to
and
he
had
actually
run
into
them
lord
the
irony
of
it
the
and
then
jimmie
dale
stared
at
the
dial
of
his
watch
incredulously
it
was
still
but
barely
midnight
it
seemed
impossible
that
since
leaving
the
theatre
at
a
few
minutes
before
eleven
he
had
lived
through
but
a
single
hour
jimmie
dale
fingers
began
to
pluck
at
the
letter
tearing
it
into
pieces
tearing
the
pieces
over
and
over
again
into
tiny
shreds
the
train
stopped
at
station
after
station
people
got
on
and
off
jimmie
dale
hat
was
over
his
eyes
and
his
eyes
were
glued
again
to
the
window
had
bookkeeper
bob
returned
to
his
flat
in
harlem
with
the
detectives
at
his
heels
or
were
burton
and
lannigan
still
trailing
the
man
downtown
somewhere
around
the
cafe
if
the
former
the
theft
of
the
letter
and
its
incident
loss
of
time
had
been
an
irreparable
disaster
if
the
latter
well
who
knew
the
risk
was
the
gray
seal
at
one
hundred
and
street
jimmie
dale
left
the
train
and
at
the
end
of
a
sharp
four
minutes
walk
during
which
he
had
dodged
in
and
out
from
street
to
street
stopped
on
a
corner
to
survey
the
block
ahead
of
him
it
was
a
block
devoted
exclusively
to
flats
and
apartment
houses
and
apart
from
a
few
belated
pedestrians
was
deserted
jimmie
dale
strolled
leisurely
down
one
side
crossed
the
street
at
the
end
of
the
block
and
strolled
leisurely
back
on
the
other
side
there
was
no
sign
of
either
burton
or
lannigan
it
was
a
fairly
safe
presumption
then
that
bookkeeper
bob
had
not
returned
yet
or
one
of
the
detectives
at
least
would
have
been
shadowing
the
house
jimmie
dale
smiling
a
little
grimly
retraced
his
steps
again
and
turned
deliberately
into
a
doorway
whose
number
he
had
noted
as
he
had
passed
a
moment
or
so
before
so
after
all
there
was
time
yet
this
was
the
house
number
eighteen
she
had
said
in
her
letter
a
flat
three
stories
moyne
lives
on
ground
jimmie
dale
leaned
against
the
vestibule
door
there
was
a
faint
click
a
little
steel
instrument
was
withdrawn
from
the
lock
and
jimmie
dale
stepped
into
the
hall
where
a
gas
jet
turned
down
burned
dimly
the
door
of
the
apartment
was
at
his
right
jimmie
dale
reached
up
and
turned
off
the
light
again
those
slim
tapering
wonderfully
sensitive
fingers
worked
with
the
little
steel
instrument
this
time
in
the
lock
of
the
apartment
door
again
there
was
that
almost
inaudible
click
and
then
cautiously
inch
by
inch
the
door
opened
under
his
hand
he
peered
inside
down
a
hallway
lighted
if
it
could
be
called
lighted
at
all
by
a
subdued
glow
from
two
open
doors
that
gave
upon
it
peered
intently
listening
intently
as
he
drew
a
black
silk
mask
from
his
pocket
and
slipped
it
over
his
face
and
then
silent
as
a
shadow
in
his
movements
the
door
left
just
ajar
behind
him
he
stole
down
the
carpeted
hallway
opposite
the
first
of
the
open
doorways
jimmie
dale
paused
a
curiously
hard
expression
creeping
over
his
face
his
lips
beginning
to
droop
ominously
downward
at
the
corners
it
was
a
little
sitting
room
cheaply
but
tastefully
furnished
and
a
young
woman
bookkeeper
bob
wife
evidently
and
evidently
sitting
up
for
her
husband
had
fallen
sound
asleep
in
a
chair
her
head
pillowed
on
her
arms
that
were
outstretched
across
the
table
for
a
moment
jimmie
dale
held
there
his
eyes
on
the
scene
and
the
next
moment
his
hand
curved
into
a
clenched
fist
he
had
passed
on
and
entered
the
adjoining
room
it
was
a
child
bedroom
a
night
lamp
burned
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
and
the
soft
rays
seemed
to
play
and
linger
in
caress
on
the
tousled
golden
hair
of
a
little
girl
of
perhaps
two
years
of
age
and
something
seemed
to
choke
suddenly
in
jimmie
dale
throat
the
sweet
innocent
little
face
upturned
to
his
was
smiling
at
him
as
she
slept
jimmie
dale
turned
away
his
head
his
eyelashes
wet
under
his
mask
beneath
the
mattress
of
the
child
bed
the
letter
had
said
his
face
like
stone
his
lips
a
thin
line
now
jimmie
dale
hand
reached
deftly
in
without
disturbing
the
child
and
took
out
a
package
and
then
another
he
straightened
up
a
bundle
of
crisp
new
notes
in
each
hand
and
on
the
top
of
one
slipped
under
the
elastic
band
that
held
the
bills
together
an
unsealed
envelope
he
drew
out
the
latter
and
opened
it
it
was
a
steamship
passage
to
vera
cruz
made
out
in
a
fictitious
name
of
course
to
john
davies
the
booking
for
next
day
sailing
from
the
ticket
from
the
stolen
money
jimmie
dale
eyes
lifted
to
rest
again
on
the
little
golden
head
the
smiling
lips
and
then
dropping
the
packages
into
his
pockets
his
own
lips
moving
queerly
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
door
my
god
the
shame
of
it
he
whispered
to
himself
he
crept
down
the
corridor
past
the
open
door
of
the
room
where
the
young
woman
still
sat
fast
asleep
and
his
mask
in
his
pocket
again
stepped
softly
into
the
vestibule
and
from
there
to
the
street
jimmie
dale
hurried
now
spurred
on
it
seemed
by
a
hot
insensate
fury
that
raged
within
him
there
was
still
one
other
call
to
make
that
night
still
those
remaining
and
minute
details
in
the
latter
part
of
her
letter
grim
and
ugly
in
their
portent
it
was
close
upon
one
in
the
morning
when
jimmie
dale
stopped
again
this
time
before
a
fashionable
dwelling
just
off
central
park
and
here
for
perhaps
the
space
of
a
minute
he
surveyed
the
house
from
the
sidewalk
watching
with
a
sort
of
speculative
satisfaction
a
shadow
that
passed
constantly
to
and
fro
across
the
drawn
blinds
of
one
of
the
lower
windows
the
rest
of
the
house
was
in
darkness
yes
said
jimmie
dale
nodding
his
head
i
rather
thought
so
the
servants
will
have
retired
hours
ago
it
safe
he
ran
quickly
up
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
a
door
opened
almost
instantly
sending
a
faint
glow
into
the
hall
from
the
lighted
room
a
hurried
step
crossed
the
hall
and
the
outer
door
was
thrown
back
well
what
is
it
demanded
a
voice
brusquely
it
was
quite
dark
too
dark
for
either
to
distinguish
the
features
and
jimmie
dale
hat
was
drawn
far
down
over
his
eyes
i
want
to
see
thomas
carling
cashier
of
the
national
bank
it
very
important
said
jimmie
dale
earnestly
i
am
carling
replied
the
other
what
is
it
jimmie
dale
leaned
forward
from
headquarters
with
a
report
he
said
in
a
low
tone
ah
exclaimed
the
bank
official
sharply
well
it
about
time
been
waiting
up
for
it
though
i
expected
you
would
telephone
rather
than
this
come
in
thank
you
said
jimmie
dale
courteously
and
stepped
into
the
hall
the
other
closed
the
front
door
the
servants
are
in
bed
of
course
he
explained
as
he
led
the
way
toward
the
lighted
room
this
way
behind
the
other
across
the
hall
jimmie
dale
followed
and
close
at
carling
heels
entered
the
room
which
was
fitted
up
quite
evidently
regardless
of
cost
as
a
combination
library
and
study
carling
in
a
somewhat
pompous
fashion
walked
straight
ahead
toward
the
desk
and
as
he
reached
it
waved
his
hand
take
a
chair
he
said
over
his
shoulder
and
then
turning
in
the
act
of
dropping
into
his
own
chair
grasped
suddenly
at
the
edge
of
the
desk
instead
and
with
a
low
startled
cry
stared
across
the
room
jimmie
dale
was
leaning
back
against
the
door
that
was
closed
now
behind
him
and
on
jimmie
dale
face
was
a
black
silk
mask
for
an
instant
neither
man
spoke
nor
moved
then
carling
dapper
in
evening
clothes
edged
back
from
the
desk
and
laughed
a
little
uncertainly
quite
neat
i
compliment
you
from
headquarters
with
a
report
i
think
you
said
which
i
neglected
to
add
said
jimmie
dale
was
to
be
made
in
carling
as
though
to
put
as
much
distance
between
them
as
possible
continued
to
edge
back
across
the
room
but
his
small
black
eyes
black
now
to
the
pupils
themselves
never
left
jimmie
dale
face
in
private
eh
he
seemed
to
be
sparring
for
time
as
he
smiled
in
private
you
a
strange
method
of
securing
privacy
have
you
a
bit
melodramatic
is
it
perhaps
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
who
you
are
jimmie
dale
smiled
indulgently
my
mask
is
only
for
effect
he
said
my
name
is
yes
said
carling
i
am
very
stupid
thank
you
i
he
had
reached
the
other
side
of
the
room
now
and
with
a
quick
sudden
movement
jerked
his
hand
to
the
dial
of
the
safe
that
stood
against
the
wall
but
jimmie
dale
was
quicker
without
shifting
his
position
his
automatic
whipped
from
his
pocket
held
a
disconcerting
bead
on
carling
forehead
please
do
do
that
said
jimmie
dale
softly
it
rather
a
good
make
that
safe
i
dare
say
it
would
take
me
half
an
hour
to
open
it
i
was
rather
curious
to
know
whether
it
was
locked
or
carling
hand
dropped
to
his
side
so
he
sneered
that
it
is
it
the
ordinary
variety
of
sneak
thief
his
voice
was
rising
gradually
well
sir
let
me
tell
you
that
mr
carling
said
jimmie
dale
in
a
low
even
tone
unless
you
moderate
your
voice
some
one
in
the
house
might
hear
you
i
am
quite
well
aware
of
that
but
if
that
happens
if
any
one
enters
this
room
if
you
make
a
move
to
touch
a
button
or
in
any
other
way
attempt
to
attract
attention
i
drop
you
where
you
stand
his
hand
behind
his
back
extracted
the
key
from
the
door
lock
held
it
up
for
the
other
to
see
then
dropped
it
into
his
pocket
and
his
voice
cold
before
rang
peremptorily
now
come
back
to
the
desk
and
sit
down
in
that
chair
he
ordered
for
a
moment
carling
hesitated
then
with
a
oath
obeyed
jimmie
dale
moved
over
and
stood
in
front
of
carling
on
the
other
side
of
the
desk
and
stared
silently
at
the
immaculate
fashionably
groomed
figure
before
him
under
the
prolonged
gaze
carling
composure
in
a
measure
at
least
seemed
to
forsake
him
he
began
to
drum
nervously
with
his
fingers
on
the
desk
and
shift
uneasily
in
his
chair
and
then
from
first
one
pocket
and
then
the
other
jimmie
dale
took
the
two
packages
of
banknotes
and
still
with
out
a
word
pushed
them
across
the
desk
until
they
lay
under
the
other
eyes
carling
fingers
stopped
their
drumming
slid
to
the
desk
edge
tightened
there
and
a
whiteness
crept
into
his
face
then
with
an
effort
he
jerked
himself
erect
in
his
chair
what
this
he
demanded
hoarsely
about
ten
thousand
dollars
i
should
say
said
jimmie
dale
slowly
i
have
counted
it
your
bank
was
robbed
this
evening
at
closing
time
i
understand
yes
carling
voice
was
excited
now
the
colour
back
in
his
face
but
you
how
do
you
mean
that
you
are
returning
the
money
to
the
bank
exactly
said
jimmie
dale
carling
was
once
more
the
pompous
bank
official
he
leaned
back
and
surveyed
jimmie
dale
critically
with
his
little
black
eyes
ah
quite
so
he
observed
that
accounts
for
the
mask
but
i
am
still
a
little
in
the
dark
under
the
circumstances
it
is
quite
impossible
that
you
should
have
stolen
the
money
yourself
and
i
did
said
jimmie
dale
i
found
it
hidden
in
the
home
of
one
of
your
you
found
it
where
in
moyne
home
up
in
moyne
eh
carling
was
alert
quick
now
jerking
out
his
words
how
did
you
come
to
get
into
this
then
his
pal
him
eh
i
suppose
you
want
a
reward
we
attend
to
that
of
course
wiser
than
you
know
my
man
that
what
we
suspected
we
had
the
detectives
trailing
moyne
all
he
reached
forward
over
the
desk
for
the
telephone
i
telephone
headquarters
to
make
the
arrest
at
just
a
minute
interposed
jimmie
dale
gravely
i
want
you
to
listen
to
a
little
story
a
story
what
has
a
story
got
to
do
with
this
snapped
carling
the
man
has
got
a
home
said
jimmie
dale
softly
a
home
and
a
wife
and
a
little
baby
oh
that
the
game
then
eh
you
want
to
plead
for
him
carling
flung
out
gruffly
well
he
should
have
thought
of
all
that
before
quite
useless
for
you
to
bring
it
up
the
man
has
had
his
chance
already
a
better
chance
than
any
one
with
his
record
ever
had
before
we
took
him
into
the
bank
knowing
that
he
was
an
but
believing
that
we
could
make
an
honest
man
of
him
and
this
is
the
and
yet
no
said
carling
icily
you
refuse
absolutely
jimmie
dale
voice
had
a
lingering
wistful
note
in
it
i
refuse
said
carling
bluntly
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
there
was
just
an
instant
silence
and
then
with
a
strange
slow
creeping
motion
as
a
panther
creeps
when
about
to
spring
jimmie
dale
projected
his
body
across
the
desk
far
across
it
toward
the
other
and
the
muscles
of
his
jaw
were
quivering
his
words
rasping
choked
with
the
sweep
of
fury
that
held
back
so
long
broke
now
in
a
passionate
surge
and
shall
i
tell
you
why
you
wo
your
bank
was
robbed
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
there
are
ten
thousand
here
the
other
ninety
thousand
are
in
your
safe
you
lie
ashen
to
the
lips
carling
had
risen
in
his
chair
you
lie
he
cried
do
you
hear
you
lie
i
tell
you
you
lie
jimmie
dale
lips
parted
ominously
sit
down
he
gritted
between
his
teeth
the
white
in
carling
face
had
turned
to
gray
his
lips
were
working
mechanically
he
sank
down
again
in
his
chair
jimmie
dale
still
leaned
over
the
desk
resting
his
weight
on
his
right
elbow
the
automatic
in
his
right
hand
covering
carling
you
cur
whispered
jimmie
dale
there
just
one
reason
only
one
that
keeps
me
from
putting
a
bullet
through
you
while
you
sit
there
we
get
to
that
in
a
moment
there
is
that
little
story
first
shall
i
tell
it
to
you
now
for
the
past
four
years
and
god
knows
how
many
before
that
you
gone
the
pace
the
lavishness
of
this
bachelor
establishment
of
yours
is
common
talk
in
new
york
far
in
excess
of
a
bank
cashier
salary
but
you
were
supposed
to
be
a
wealthy
man
in
your
own
right
and
so
in
reality
you
were
once
but
you
went
through
your
fortune
two
years
ago
counted
a
model
citizen
an
upright
man
an
honour
to
the
community
what
were
you
carling
what
are
you
shall
i
tell
you
roue
gambler
leading
a
double
life
of
the
fastest
kind
you
did
it
cleverly
carling
hid
it
well
but
your
game
is
up
for
instance
you
are
at
the
end
of
your
tether
swamped
with
debts
exposure
threatening
you
at
any
moment
why
do
you
tell
me
again
that
i
lie
carling
but
now
the
man
made
no
answer
he
had
sunk
a
little
deeper
in
his
chair
a
dawning
look
of
terror
in
the
eyes
that
held
fascinated
on
jimmie
dale
you
cur
said
jimmie
dale
again
you
cur
with
your
devil
work
a
year
ago
you
saw
this
night
coming
when
you
must
have
money
or
face
ruin
and
exposure
you
saw
it
then
a
year
ago
the
day
that
moyne
concealing
nothing
of
his
prison
record
applied
through
friends
for
a
position
in
the
bank
your
were
opposed
to
his
appointment
but
you
do
you
remember
how
you
pleaded
to
give
the
man
his
chance
and
in
your
hellish
ingenuity
saw
your
way
then
out
of
the
trap
an
from
sing
sing
it
was
enough
was
it
what
chance
had
he
jimmie
dale
paused
his
left
hand
clenched
until
the
skin
formed
whitish
knobs
over
the
knuckles
carling
tongue
sought
his
lips
made
a
circuit
of
them
and
he
tried
to
speak
but
his
voice
was
an
incoherent
muttering
i
not
waste
words
said
jimmie
dale
in
his
grim
monotone
i
not
sure
enough
myself
that
i
could
keep
my
hands
off
you
much
longer
the
actual
details
of
how
you
stole
the
money
do
not
matter
now
a
little
later
perhaps
in
court
but
not
now
you
were
the
last
to
leave
the
bank
but
before
leaving
you
pretended
to
discover
the
theft
of
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
that
done
up
in
a
paper
parcel
was
even
then
reposing
in
your
desk
you
brought
the
parcel
home
put
it
in
that
safe
there
and
notified
the
president
of
the
bank
by
telephone
from
here
of
the
robbery
suggesting
that
police
headquarters
be
advised
at
once
he
told
you
to
go
ahead
and
act
as
you
saw
best
you
notified
the
police
speciously
directing
suspicion
to
the
in
the
bank
employ
you
knew
moyne
was
dining
out
you
knew
where
and
at
a
hint
from
you
the
police
took
up
the
trail
a
little
later
in
the
evening
you
took
these
two
packages
of
banknotes
from
the
rest
and
with
this
steamship
ticket
which
you
obtained
yesterday
while
out
at
lunch
by
sending
a
district
messenger
boy
with
the
money
and
instructions
in
a
sealed
envelope
to
purchase
for
you
you
went
up
to
the
moynes
flat
in
harlem
for
the
purpose
of
secreting
them
somewhere
there
you
pretended
to
be
much
disappointed
at
finding
moyne
out
you
had
just
come
for
a
little
social
visit
to
get
better
acquainted
with
the
home
life
of
your
employees
moyne
was
genuinely
pleased
and
grateful
she
took
you
in
to
see
their
little
girl
who
was
already
asleep
in
bed
she
left
you
there
for
a
moment
to
answer
the
door
and
you
you
jimmie
voice
choked
again
you
blot
on
god
earth
you
slipped
the
money
and
ticket
under
the
child
mattress
carling
came
forward
with
a
lurch
in
his
chair
and
his
hands
went
out
pawing
in
a
wild
pleading
fashion
over
jimmie
dale
arm
jimmie
dale
flung
him
away
you
were
safe
enough
he
rasped
on
the
police
could
only
construe
your
visit
to
moyne
flat
as
zeal
on
behalf
of
the
bank
and
it
was
safer
much
more
circumspect
on
your
part
not
to
order
the
flat
searched
at
once
but
only
as
a
last
resort
as
it
were
after
you
had
led
the
police
to
trail
him
all
evening
and
still
remain
without
a
clew
and
besides
of
course
not
until
you
had
planted
the
evidence
that
was
to
damn
him
and
wreck
his
life
and
home
you
were
even
generous
in
the
amount
you
deprived
yourself
of
out
of
the
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
less
would
have
been
enough
caught
with
ten
thousand
dollars
of
the
bank
money
and
a
steamship
ticket
made
out
in
a
fictitious
name
it
was
evidence
that
he
had
done
the
job
and
had
the
balance
somewhere
what
would
his
denials
his
protestations
of
innocence
count
for
he
was
an
a
hardened
criminal
caught
with
a
portion
of
the
proceeds
of
robbery
he
had
succeeded
in
hiding
the
remainder
of
it
too
cleverly
that
was
carling
face
was
ghastly
his
hands
went
out
again
again
his
tongue
moistened
his
dry
lips
he
whispered
is
is
there
some
some
way
we
can
fix
this
and
then
jimmie
dale
laughed
not
pleasantly
yes
there
a
way
carling
he
said
grimly
that
why
i
he
picked
up
a
sheet
of
writing
paper
and
pushed
it
across
the
desk
then
a
pen
which
he
dipped
into
the
inkstand
and
extended
to
the
other
the
way
you
fix
it
will
be
to
write
out
a
confession
exonerating
carling
shrank
back
into
his
chair
his
head
huddling
into
his
shoulders
no
he
cried
i
wo
i
ca
my
god
i
i
wo
the
automatic
in
jimmie
dale
hand
edged
forward
the
fraction
of
an
inch
i
have
not
used
this
yet
you
understand
now
why
do
you
he
said
under
his
breath
no
no
carling
pushed
away
the
pen
i
ruined
ruined
as
it
is
but
this
would
mean
the
penitentiary
too
where
you
tried
to
send
an
innocent
man
in
your
place
you
hound
where
you
some
other
way
some
other
way
carling
was
babbling
let
me
out
of
this
for
god
sake
let
me
out
of
this
carling
said
jimmie
dale
hoarsely
i
stood
beside
a
little
bed
and
looked
at
a
baby
girl
a
little
baby
girl
with
golden
hair
who
smiled
as
she
carling
shivered
and
passed
a
shaking
hand
across
his
face
take
this
pen
said
jimmie
dale
monotonously
or
this
the
automatic
lifted
until
the
muzzle
was
on
a
line
with
carling
eyes
carling
hand
reached
out
still
shaking
and
took
the
pen
and
his
body
dragged
limply
forward
hung
over
the
desk
the
pen
spluttered
on
the
paper
a
bead
of
sweat
spurting
from
the
man
forehead
dropped
to
the
sheet
there
was
silence
in
the
room
a
minute
passed
another
carling
pen
travelled
haltingly
across
the
paper
then
with
a
queer
low
cry
as
he
signed
his
name
he
dropped
the
pen
from
his
fingers
and
rising
unsteadily
from
his
chair
stumbled
away
from
the
desk
toward
a
couch
across
the
room
an
instant
jimmie
dale
watched
the
other
then
he
picked
up
the
sheet
of
paper
it
was
a
miserable
document
miserably
scrawled
i
guess
it
all
up
i
guess
i
knew
it
would
be
some
day
moyne
anything
to
do
with
it
i
stole
the
money
myself
from
the
bank
i
guess
it
all
up
thomas
from
the
paper
jimmie
dale
eyes
shifted
to
the
figure
by
the
couch
and
the
paper
fluttered
suddenly
from
his
fingers
to
the
desk
carling
was
reeling
clutching
at
his
throat
a
small
glass
vial
rolled
upon
the
carpet
and
then
even
as
jimmie
dale
sprang
forward
the
other
pitched
head
long
over
the
couch
and
in
a
moment
it
was
over
presently
jimmie
dale
picked
up
the
vial
and
dropped
it
back
on
the
floor
again
there
was
no
label
on
it
but
it
needed
none
the
strong
penetrating
odor
of
bitter
almonds
was
telltale
evidence
enough
it
was
prussic
or
hydrocyanic
acid
probably
the
most
deadly
poison
and
the
swiftest
in
its
action
that
was
known
to
science
carling
had
provided
against
that
some
day
in
his
confession
for
a
little
space
motionless
jimmie
dale
stood
looking
down
at
the
silent
outstretched
form
then
he
walked
slowly
back
to
the
desk
and
slowly
deliberately
picked
up
the
signed
confession
and
the
steamship
ticket
he
held
them
an
instant
staring
at
them
then
methodically
began
to
tear
them
into
little
pieces
a
strange
tired
smile
hovering
on
his
lips
the
man
was
dead
now
there
would
be
disgrace
enough
for
some
one
to
bear
a
mother
perhaps
who
knew
and
there
was
another
way
now
since
the
man
was
dead
jimmie
dale
put
the
pieces
in
his
pocket
went
to
the
safe
opened
it
and
took
out
a
parcel
locked
the
safe
carefully
and
carried
the
parcel
to
the
desk
he
opened
it
there
inside
were
nearly
two
dozen
little
packages
of
bills
the
other
two
packages
that
he
had
brought
with
him
he
added
to
the
rest
from
his
pocket
he
took
out
the
thin
metal
insignia
case
and
with
the
tiny
tweezers
lifted
up
one
of
the
paper
seals
he
moistened
the
adhesive
side
and
still
holding
it
by
the
tweezers
dropped
it
on
his
handkerchief
and
pressed
the
seal
down
on
the
face
of
the
topmost
package
of
banknotes
he
tied
the
parcel
up
then
and
picking
up
the
pen
addressed
it
in
printed
characters
national
bank
new
york
city
district
messenger
some
way
in
the
morning
he
murmured
jimmie
dale
slipped
his
mask
into
his
pocket
and
with
the
parcel
under
his
arm
stepped
to
the
door
and
unlocked
it
he
paused
for
an
instant
on
the
threshold
for
a
single
quick
comprehensive
glance
around
the
room
then
passed
on
out
into
the
street
at
the
corner
he
stopped
to
light
a
cigarette
and
the
flame
of
the
match
spurting
up
disclosed
a
face
that
was
worn
and
haggard
he
threw
the
match
away
smiled
a
little
wearily
and
went
on
the
gray
seal
had
committed
another
chapter

the
thief
choosing
between
the
snowy
napery
the
sparkling
glass
and
silver
the
cozy
shaded
the
famous
french
chef
of
the
james
club
his
own
home
on
riverside
drive
where
a
dinner
fit
for
an
epicure
and
served
by
jason
that
most
perfect
of
butlers
awaited
him
and
marlianne
jimmie
dale
driving
in
alone
in
his
touring
car
from
an
afternoon
golf
had
chosen
marlianne
marlianne
if
such
a
thing
as
bohemianism
or
rather
a
concrete
expression
of
it
exists
was
bohemian
a
string
orchestra
played
valiantly
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
piano
and
between
courses
the
diners
took
up
the
refrain
and
as
it
was
always
between
courses
with
some
one
the
place
was
a
bedlam
of
noisy
riot
nevertheless
it
was
marlianne
and
jimmie
dale
liked
marlianne
he
had
dined
there
many
times
before
as
he
had
just
dined
in
the
person
of
jimmie
dale
the
millionaire
his
imported
car
at
the
curb
of
the
shabby
street
outside
and
he
had
dined
there
disreputable
in
attire
seedy
in
appearance
with
the
police
yelping
at
his
heels
as
larry
the
bat
in
either
character
marlianne
had
welcomed
him
with
equal
courtesy
to
its
spotted
linen
and
most
excellent
with
vin
ordinaire
for
fifty
cents
and
now
in
the
act
of
reaching
into
his
pocket
for
the
change
to
pay
his
bill
jimmie
dale
seemed
suddenly
to
experience
some
difficulty
in
finding
what
he
sought
and
his
fingers
went
fumbling
from
one
pocket
to
another
two
men
at
the
table
in
front
of
him
were
talking
their
voices
over
a
momentary
lull
in
violin
squeaks
talk
laughter
singing
and
the
clatter
of
dishes
reached
him
carling
commit
suicide
not
on
your
life
no
of
course
he
did
it
was
that
cursed
gray
seal
croaked
him
just
as
sure
as
you
sit
in
that
chair
the
other
grunted
yes
but
what
the
gray
seal
want
to
pinch
a
hundred
thousand
out
of
the
bank
for
and
then
give
it
back
again
the
next
morning
what
he
done
a
hundred
other
things
for
to
cover
up
the
real
object
of
what
he
after
retorted
the
first
speaker
with
a
short
vicious
laugh
then
with
a
thump
of
his
fist
on
the
table
the
man
a
devil
a
fiend
and
anywhere
else
but
new
york
he
have
been
caught
and
sent
to
the
chair
where
he
belongs
long
ago
and
a
burst
of
ragtime
drowned
out
the
man
words
jimmie
dale
placed
a
piece
and
a
tip
beside
it
on
his
dinner
check
pushed
back
his
chair
and
rose
from
the
table
there
was
a
satirical
glint
in
his
dark
steady
eyes
it
was
not
only
the
police
who
yelped
at
his
heels
but
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
city
the
man
had
not
voiced
his
own
sentiments
he
had
voiced
the
sentiments
of
new
york
and
it
was
quite
on
the
cards
that
if
he
jimmie
dale
were
ever
caught
his
destination
would
not
even
be
the
death
cell
and
the
chair
at
sing
sing
his
fellow
citizens
had
reached
a
pitch
where
they
would
be
quite
capable
of
literally
tearing
him
to
pieces
if
they
ever
got
their
hands
on
him
and
yet
there
were
a
few
a
very
few
a
handful
out
of
five
millions
who
sometimes
remembered
perhaps
to
thank
god
that
the
gray
seal
lived
that
was
his
reward
that
and
she
whose
mysterious
letters
prompted
and
impelled
his
the
gray
seal
acts
she
nameless
fascinating
in
her
brilliant
resourcefulness
amazing
in
her
power
a
woman
whose
life
was
bound
up
with
his
and
yet
held
apart
from
him
in
the
most
inexplicable
absorbing
way
a
woman
he
had
never
seen
save
for
her
gloved
arm
in
the
limousine
that
night
who
at
one
unexpected
moment
projected
a
dazzling
impersonal
existence
across
his
path
and
the
next
leaving
him
battling
for
his
life
where
greed
and
passion
and
crime
swirled
about
him
was
gone
jimmie
dale
threaded
the
small
crowded
rooms
the
interior
of
marlianne
had
never
been
altered
from
the
days
when
the
place
had
been
a
family
residence
of
some
pretension
and
reaching
the
hall
received
his
hat
from
the
boy
in
attendance
he
passed
outside
and
at
the
top
of
the
steps
paused
as
he
took
his
cigarette
case
from
his
pocket
it
was
nearly
a
week
since
carling
the
cashier
of
the
national
bank
had
been
found
dead
in
his
home
a
bottle
that
had
contained
hydrocyanic
acid
on
the
floor
beside
him
nearly
a
week
since
bookkeeper
bob
unaware
that
he
had
ever
been
under
temporary
suspicion
for
the
robbery
of
the
bank
had
equally
unknown
to
himself
been
cleared
of
any
complicity
in
that
affair
and
yet
as
witness
the
conversation
of
a
moment
ago
it
was
still
the
topic
of
new
york
still
the
vital
issue
that
filled
the
maw
of
the
newspapers
with
ravings
threats
and
execrations
against
the
gray
seal
snarling
virulently
the
while
at
the
police
for
the
latter
ineptitude
inefficiency
and
impotence
jimmie
dale
closed
his
cigarette
case
with
a
snap
that
was
almost
human
in
its
irony
dropped
it
back
into
his
pocket
and
lighted
a
match
but
the
flame
was
arrested
halfway
to
the
tip
of
his
cigarette
as
his
eyes
fixed
suddenly
and
curiously
on
a
woman
form
hurrying
down
the
street
she
had
turned
the
corner
before
he
took
his
eyes
from
her
and
the
match
between
his
fingers
had
gone
out
not
that
there
was
anything
very
strange
in
a
woman
walking
or
even
half
running
along
the
street
nor
that
there
was
anything
particularly
attractive
or
unusual
about
her
and
if
there
had
been
the
street
was
too
dark
for
him
to
have
distinguished
it
it
was
not
that
it
was
the
fact
that
she
had
neither
passed
by
the
house
on
whose
steps
he
stood
nor
come
out
of
any
of
the
adjoining
houses
it
was
as
though
she
had
suddenly
and
miraculously
appeared
out
of
thin
air
and
taken
form
on
a
sidewalk
a
little
way
down
from
marlianne
that
queer
commented
jimmie
dale
to
himself
however
he
took
out
another
match
lighted
his
cigarette
jerked
the
match
stub
away
from
him
and
with
a
lift
of
his
shoulders
went
down
the
steps
he
crossed
the
pavement
walked
around
the
front
of
his
machine
since
the
steering
wheel
was
on
the
side
next
to
the
curb
and
with
his
hand
out
to
open
the
car
door
stopped
some
one
had
been
tampering
with
it
it
was
not
quite
closed
there
was
no
mistake
jimmie
dale
made
no
mistakes
of
that
kind
a
man
whose
life
hung
a
dozen
times
a
day
on
little
things
could
not
afford
to
make
them
he
had
closed
it
firmly
even
with
a
bang
when
he
had
got
out
instantly
suspicious
he
wrenched
the
door
wide
open
switched
on
the
light
under
the
hood
and
with
a
sharp
exclamation
bent
quickly
forward
a
glove
a
woman
glove
a
white
glove
lay
on
the
floor
of
the
car
jimmie
dale
pulse
leaped
suddenly
into
fierce
pounding
beats
it
was
hers
he
knew
that
intuitively
knew
it
as
he
knew
that
he
breathed
and
that
woman
he
had
so
leisurely
watched
as
she
had
disappeared
from
sight
was
must
have
been
she
he
sprang
from
the
car
with
a
jump
his
first
impulse
to
dash
after
her
and
checked
himself
laughing
a
little
bitterly
it
was
too
late
for
that
now
he
had
already
let
his
chance
slip
through
his
fingers
around
the
corner
was
sixth
avenue
surface
cars
the
elevated
taxicabs
a
multitude
of
people
any
one
of
a
hundred
ways
in
which
she
could
and
would
already
have
discounted
pursuit
from
him
and
besides
he
would
not
even
have
been
able
to
recognise
her
if
he
saw
her
jimmie
dale
smile
was
mirthless
as
he
turned
back
to
the
car
and
picked
up
the
glove
why
had
she
dropped
it
there
it
could
not
have
been
intentional
why
had
he
began
to
tear
suddenly
at
the
little
finger
and
in
another
second
kneeling
on
the
car
step
his
shoulders
inside
he
was
holding
a
ring
close
under
the
little
electric
bulb
it
was
a
gold
seal
ring
a
small
dainty
thing
that
bore
a
crest
a
bell
surmounted
by
a
bishop
mitre
the
bell
quaint
in
design
harking
the
imagination
back
to
some
belfry
tower
and
underneath
in
the
scroll
a
motto
it
was
a
full
minute
before
jimmie
dale
could
decipher
it
for
the
lettering
was
minute
and
the
words
of
course
reversed
it
was
in
french
sonnez
le
tocsin
he
straightened
up
the
glove
and
ring
in
his
hand
a
puzzled
expression
on
his
face
it
was
strange
had
she
after
all
dropped
the
glove
there
intentionally
had
she
at
last
let
down
the
barriers
just
a
little
between
them
and
given
him
this
little
intimate
sign
that
she
and
then
jimmie
dale
laughed
abruptly
he
was
only
trying
to
deceive
himself
to
argue
himself
into
believing
what
with
heart
and
soul
he
wanted
to
believe
it
was
not
like
her
and
neither
was
it
so
his
eyes
had
fixed
on
the
seat
beside
the
wheel
he
had
not
used
the
lap
rug
all
that
day
he
could
use
a
rug
and
drive
he
had
left
it
folded
and
hanging
on
the
rack
in
the
tonneau
it
was
now
neatly
folded
and
reposing
on
the
front
seat
yes
said
jimmie
dale
a
sort
of
in
his
tones
i
might
have
he
lifted
the
rug
beneath
it
on
the
leather
seat
lay
a
white
envelope
her
letter
the
letter
that
never
came
save
with
the
plan
of
some
grim
desperate
work
outlined
ahead
the
call
to
arms
for
the
gray
seal
sonnez
le
tocsin
ring
the
tocsin
sound
the
alarm
the
tocsin
the
words
were
running
through
his
brain
a
strange
motto
on
that
crest
that
seemed
so
strangely
apt
the
tocsin
never
once
in
all
the
times
that
he
had
heard
from
her
never
once
in
the
years
that
had
gone
since
that
initial
letter
of
hers
had
struck
its
first
warning
note
had
any
communication
from
her
been
but
to
sound
again
a
new
alarm
the
toscin
the
tocsin
the
word
seemed
to
visualise
her
to
give
her
a
concrete
form
and
being
to
breathe
her
very
personality
the
tocsin
jimmie
dale
whispered
the
word
softly
a
little
wistfully
yes
i
shall
call
you
that
the
tocsin
he
folded
the
glove
very
carefully
placed
it
with
the
ring
in
his
pocketbook
picked
up
the
letter
and
with
a
sharp
exclamation
turned
it
quickly
over
in
his
fingers
then
bent
hurriedly
with
it
to
the
light
strange
things
were
happening
that
night
for
the
first
time
the
letter
was
not
even
sealed
that
was
not
like
her
either
what
did
it
mean
quick
alert
now
anxious
even
he
pulled
the
double
folded
sheets
from
the
envelope
glanced
rapidly
through
them
and
after
a
moment
a
smile
whimsical
came
slowly
to
his
lips
it
was
quite
plain
now
all
of
it
the
glove
the
ring
and
the
unsealed
letter
and
the
postscript
held
the
secret
or
rather
what
had
been
intended
for
a
postscript
did
for
it
comprised
only
a
few
words
ending
abruptly
unfinished
look
in
the
cupboard
at
the
rear
of
the
room
the
man
with
the
red
wig
is
that
was
all
and
the
words
written
in
ink
were
badly
blurred
as
though
the
paper
had
been
hastily
folded
before
the
ink
was
dry
it
was
quite
plain
and
in
view
of
the
real
explanation
of
it
all
eminently
characteristic
of
her
with
the
letter
already
written
she
had
come
there
meaning
to
place
it
on
the
seat
and
cover
it
with
the
rug
as
indeed
she
had
done
then
deciding
to
add
the
postscript
and
because
she
would
attract
less
attention
that
way
than
in
any
other
she
had
climbed
into
the
car
as
though
it
belonged
to
her
and
had
seated
herself
there
to
write
it
she
would
have
been
hurried
in
her
movements
of
course
and
in
pulling
off
her
glove
to
use
the
fountain
pen
the
ring
had
come
with
it
the
rest
was
obvious
she
had
but
just
begun
to
write
when
he
had
appeared
on
the
steps
she
had
slipped
instantly
down
to
the
floor
of
the
car
probably
dropping
the
glove
from
her
lap
hastily
inclosed
the
letter
in
the
envelope
which
she
had
no
time
to
seal
thrust
the
envelope
under
the
rug
and
forgetting
her
glove
and
fearful
of
risking
his
attention
by
attempting
to
close
the
door
firmly
had
stolen
along
the
body
of
the
car
only
to
be
noticed
by
him
too
late
when
she
was
well
down
the
street
and
at
that
latter
thought
once
more
chagrin
seized
jimmie
dale
then
he
turned
impulsively
to
the
letter
all
this
was
extraneous
apart
for
another
time
when
every
moment
was
not
a
priceless
asset
as
it
very
probably
was
now
dear
philanthropic
crook
it
always
began
that
way
never
any
other
way
he
read
on
more
and
more
intently
crouched
there
close
to
the
light
on
the
floor
of
his
car
lips
thinning
as
he
proceeded
read
it
to
the
end
absorbing
memorising
it
and
then
the
abortive
postscript
look
in
the
cupboard
at
the
rear
of
the
room
the
man
with
the
red
wig
is
for
an
instant
as
mechanically
he
tore
the
letter
into
little
shreds
he
held
there
hesitant
and
the
next
slamming
the
door
tight
he
flung
himself
into
the
seat
behind
the
wheel
and
the
big
machine
was
roaring
down
the
street
the
tocsin
there
was
a
grim
smile
on
jimmie
dale
lips
now
the
alarm
yes
it
was
always
an
alarm
quick
sudden
an
emergency
to
face
on
the
instant
plans
decisions
to
be
made
with
no
time
to
ponder
them
with
only
that
one
fact
to
consider
staggering
enough
in
itself
that
a
mistake
meant
disaster
and
ruin
to
some
one
else
and
to
himself
if
the
courts
were
merciful
where
he
had
little
hope
for
mercy
the
penitentiary
for
life
and
now
again
as
it
almost
always
was
when
these
mysterious
letters
came
every
moment
of
inaction
was
piling
up
the
odds
against
him
and
too
the
same
problem
confronted
him
how
in
what
way
in
what
role
must
he
play
the
night
game
to
its
end
as
larry
the
bat
the
car
was
speeding
forward
he
was
heading
down
broadway
now
lower
broadway
that
stretched
before
him
deserted
like
some
dark
narrow
canyon
where
far
below
like
towering
walls
the
buildings
closed
together
and
seemed
to
converge
into
some
black
impassable
barrier
the
street
lights
flashed
by
him
a
patrolman
stopped
the
swinging
of
his
and
turned
to
gaze
at
the
car
that
rushed
by
at
a
rate
perilously
near
to
contempt
of
speed
laws
street
cars
passed
at
indifferent
intervals
pedestrians
were
few
and
far
between
it
was
the
lower
broadway
of
night
larry
the
bat
jimmie
dale
shook
his
head
impatiently
over
the
steering
wheel
no
that
would
not
do
it
would
be
well
enough
for
this
young
burton
perhaps
but
not
for
old
isaac
the
east
side
fence
for
isaac
knew
him
in
the
character
of
larry
the
bat
his
quick
keen
brain
weaving
eliminating
devising
scheming
discarded
that
idea
the
final
coup
of
the
night
as
yet
but
sensed
in
an
indefinite
unshaped
way
if
enacted
in
the
person
of
larry
the
bat
would
therefore
stamp
larry
the
bat
and
the
gray
seal
as
one
a
contretemps
but
little
less
fatal
in
view
of
old
issac
than
to
bracket
the
gray
seal
and
jimmie
dale
larry
the
bat
was
not
a
character
to
be
assumed
with
impunity
nor
one
to
jeopardize
it
was
a
bulwark
of
safety
at
it
were
to
which
more
than
once
he
owed
escape
from
capture
and
discovery
he
lifted
his
shoulders
with
a
sudden
jerk
of
decision
as
the
car
swerved
to
the
left
and
headed
for
the
east
side
there
was
only
one
alternative
then
the
black
silk
mask
that
folded
into
such
tiny
compass
and
that
together
with
an
automatic
and
the
curious
thin
metal
case
that
looked
so
like
a
cigarette
case
was
always
in
his
pocket
for
an
emergency
the
car
turned
again
and
approaching
its
destination
jimmie
dale
slowed
down
the
speed
perceptibly
it
was
a
strange
case
not
a
pleasant
one
and
the
raw
edges
where
they
showed
were
ugly
in
their
nakedness
old
isaac
pelina
young
burton
and
maddon
wilmington
maddon
the
magnate
curious
that
of
the
three
he
should
already
know
two
old
isaac
and
maddon
everybody
in
the
east
side
every
denizen
of
the
underworld
and
many
who
posed
on
a
far
higher
plane
knew
old
isaac
fence
to
the
most
select
clientele
of
thieves
in
new
york
unscrupulous
hand
in
glove
with
any
rascality
or
crime
that
promised
profit
a
money
lender
a
shylock
without
even
a
shylock
humanity
as
a
saving
grace
yes
as
larry
the
bat
he
knew
old
isaac
and
he
knew
him
not
only
personally
but
by
firsthand
reputation
he
had
heard
the
man
cursed
in
blasphemous
abandon
by
more
than
one
crook
who
was
in
the
old
fence
toils
they
dealt
with
him
the
crooks
while
they
swore
to
get
him
because
he
was
safe
but
jimmie
dale
lips
parted
in
a
mirthless
smile
some
day
old
isaac
would
be
found
in
that
spiders
den
of
his
back
of
the
dingy
loan
office
with
a
knife
in
his
heart
or
a
bullet
through
his
head
and
wilmington
maddon
jimmie

grew
whimsical
he

maddon
quite
intimately
for
years
had
even
dined
with
him
at

james
club
only
a
few
nights
before

and

jimmie
dale
lips
thinned
again
well
burton
acquaintance
was
still
to
be
made
it
was
a
curious
trio
and
it
was
dirty
work
more
raw
than
cunning
more
devilish
than
ingenious
blackmail
in
its
most
hellish
form
the
stake
at
the
least
calculation
a
cool
half
million
a
heavy
price
for
a
single
slip
in
a
man
life
he
brought
the
car
abruptly
to
a
halt
at
the
edge
of
the
curb
and
sprang
out
to
the
ground
he
was
in
front
of
the
budapest
restaurant
a
garish
establishment
most
popular
of
all
resorts
for
the
moment
on
the
east
side
where
fifth
avenue
in
the
fond
belief
that
it
was
seeing
the
real
thing
in
seamy
life
engaged
its
table
a
week
in
advance
jimmie
dale
pushed
a
bill
into
the
door
attendant
hand
accompanied
by
an
injunction
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
machine
and
entered
the
cafe
but
for
a
sort
of
tinselled
ostentation
the
place
might
well
have
been
the
marlianne
that
he
had
just
left
it
was
crowded
and
riot
was
at
its
height
a
stringed
orchestra
in
hungarian
costume
played
what
purported
to
be
hungarian
airs
shouts
laughter
clatter
of
dishes
and
thump
of
steins
added
to
the
din
he
made
his
way
between
the
tables
to
the
stairs
and
descended
to
the
lower
floor
here
if
anything
the
confusion
was
greater
than
above
but
here
too
was
an
exit
through
to
the
rear
street
and
a
moment
later
he
was
sauntering
past
the
front
of
an
unkempt
little
pawnshop
closed
for
the
night
over
whose
door
in
the
murk
of
a
distant
street
lamp
three
balls
hung
in
sagging
disarray
tawny
with
age
and
across
whose
dirty
unwashed
windows
letters
missing
ran
the
legend
is
ac
pelina
pawn
brok
r
the
pawnshop
made
the
corner
of
a
very
dark
and
narrow
lane
and
with
a
quick
glance
around
him
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
unobserved
jimmie
dale
stepped
into
the
alleyway
and
lost
instantly
in
the
blacker
shadows
stole
along
by
the
wall
of
the
pawnshop
old
isaac
business
was
not
all
done
through
the
front
door
and
then
suddenly
jimmie
dale
shrank
still
closer
against
the
wall
was
it
intuition
premonition
or
reality
there
seemed
an
uncanny
feeling
of
presence
around
him
as
though
perhaps
he
were
watched
as
though
others
beside
himself
were
in
the
lane
yes
ahead
of
him
a
shadow
moved
he
could
just
barely
distinguish
it
now
that
his
eyes
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
darkness
it
like
himself
was
close
against
the
wall
and
now
it
slunk
noiselessly
down
the
length
of
the
lane
until
he
lost
sight
of
it
and
what
was
that
he
strained
his
ears
to
listen
it
seemed
like
a
window
being
opened
or
closed
cautiously
stealthily
the
fraction
of
an
inch
at
a
time
and
then
he
located
the
sound
it
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
lane
and
very
nearly
opposite
to
where
on
the
second
floor
a
dull
yellow
glow
shone
out
from
old
isaac
private
den
in
the
rear
of
the
pawnshop
office
jimmie
dale
brows
were
gathered
in
sharp
furrows
there
was
evidently
something
afoot
of
which
the
tocsin
had
not
sounded
the
alarm
and
then
the
frown
relaxed
and
he
smiled
a
little
miraculous
as
was
the
means
through
which
she
obtained
the
knowledge
that
was
the
basis
of
their
strange
partnership
it
was
no
more
miraculous
than
her
unerring
accuracy
in
the
minutest
details
the
tocsin
had
never
failed
him
yet
it
was
possible
that
something
was
afoot
around
him
quite
probable
indeed
since
he
was
in
the
most
vicious
part
of
the
city
in
the
heart
of
gangland
but
whatever
it
might
be
it
was
certainly
extraneous
to
his
mission
or
she
would
have
mentioned
it
the
lane
was
empty
now
he
was
quite
sure
of
that
and
there
was
no
further
sound
from
the
window
opposite
he
started
forward
once
more
only
to
halt
again
for
the
second
time
as
abruptly
as
before
squeezing
if
possible
even
more
closely
against
the
wall
some
one
had
turned
into
the
lane
from
the
sidewalk
and
walking
hurriedly
choosing
with
evident
precaution
the
exact
centre
of
the
alleyway
came
toward
him
the
man
passed
his
hurried
stride
a
half
run
and
a
few
feet
beyond
halted
at
old
isaac
side
door
from
somewhere
inside
the
old
building
jimmie
dale
ears
caught
the
faint
ringing
of
an
electric
bell
a
long
ring
followed
in
quick
succession
by
three
short
ones
then
the
repeated
clicking
of
a
latch
as
though
pulled
by
a
cord
from
above
and
the
man
passed
in
through
the
door
closing
it
behind
him
jimmie
dale
nodded
to
himself
in
the
darkness
it
was
a
spring
lock
the
signal
was
one
long
ring
and
three
short
ones
the
tocsin
had
not
missed
even
those
small
details
also
burton
was
late
for
his
appointment
for
that
must
have
been
burton
business
such
as
old
isaac
had
in
hand
that
night
would
have
permitted
the
entrance
of
no
other
visitor
but
wilmington
maddon
private
secretary
he
moved
down
the
lane
to
the
door
and
tried
it
softly
it
was
locked
of
course
the
slim
tapering
sensitive
fingers
whose
tips
were
eyes
and
ears
to
jimmie
dale
felt
over
the
lock
and
a
slender
little
steel
instrument
slipped
into
the
keyhole
a
moment
more
and
the
catch
was
released
and
the
door
under
his
hand
began
to
open
with
it
ajar
he
paused
his
eyes
searching
intently
up
and
down
the
lane
there
was
nothing
no
sign
of
any
one
no
moving
shadows
now
his
gaze
shifted
to
the
window
opposite
directly
facing
it
now
with
the
dull
reflection
upon
it
from
the
lighted
window
of
old
isaac
den
above
his
head
he
could
make
out
that
it
was
open
but
that
was
all
once
more
he
smiled
a
little
tolerantly
at
himself
this
time
some
one
had
been
in
the
lane
some
one
had
opened
the
window
of
his
or
her
room
in
that
tenement
house
across
from
him
surely
there
was
nothing
surprising
unnatural
or
even
out
of
the
commonplace
in
that
he
had
been
a
little
bit
on
edge
himself
perhaps
and
the
sudden
movement
of
that
shadow
unexpected
had
startled
him
for
the
moment
as
in
all
probability
the
opening
of
the
window
had
startled
the
skulking
figure
itself
into
action
the
door
was
open
now
he
stepped
noiselessly
inside
and
closed
it
noiselessly
behind
him
he
was
in
a
narrow
hall
where
a
few
yards
away
a
light
shone
down
a
stairway
at
right
angles
to
the
hall
itself
rear
door
of
pawnshop
opens
into
hall
and
exactly
opposite
very
short
flight
of
stairs
leading
directly
to
doorway
of
isaac
den
above
ramshackle
old
place
low
ceilings
isaac
when
sitting
in
his
den
can
look
down
and
by
means
of
a
transom
over
the
rear
door
of
the
shop
see
the
customers
as
they
enter
from
the
street
while
he
also
keeps
an
eye
on
his
assistant
latter
always
locks
up
and
leaves
promptly
at
six
jimmie
dale
was
subconsciously
repeating
to
himself
snatches
from
the
tocsin
letter
which
as
subconsciously
in
reading
he
had
memorised
almost
word
for
word
and
now
voices
reached
him
one
excited
nervous
as
though
the
speaker
were
labouring
under
mental
strain
that
bordered
closely
on
the
hysterical
the
other
curiously
mingling
a
querulousness
with
an
attempt
to
pacify
but
dominantly
contemptuous
sneering
cold
jimmie
dale
moved
along
the
hall
very
slowly
without
a
sound
testing
each
step
before
he
threw
his
body
weight
from
one
leg
to
the
other
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
tocsin
had
been
right
it
was
a
very
short
flight
he
counted
the
steps
there
were
eight
above
facing
him
a
door
was
open
the
voices
were
louder
now
it
was
a
room
what
he
could
see
of
it
in
its
appearance
intentionally
so
probably
for
effect
with
no
attempt
whatever
at
furnishing
he
could
see
through
the
doorway
to
the
window
that
opened
on
the
alleyway
or
rather
just
glimpse
the
top
of
the
window
at
an
angle
across
the
room
that
and
a
bare
stretch
of
floor
the
two
men
were
not
in
the
line
of
vision
burton
voice
it
was
unquestionably
burton
speaking
came
to
jimmie
dale
now
distinctly
no
i
did
i
tell
you
i
did
i
i
had
the
jimmie
dale
slipped
his
black
silk
mask
over
his
face
and
with
extreme
caution
on
hands
and
knees
began
to
climb
the
stairs
so
it
was
old
isaac
now
in
a
half
purr
half
sneer
and
i
was
so
sure
my
young
friend
that
you
had
i
was
so
sure
that
you
were
not
such
a
fool
yes
i
could
even
have
sworn
that
they
were
in
your
pocket
now
what
it
is
too
bad
too
bad
it
is
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
think
of
that
little
chair
up
the
river
in
its
horrible
little
room
where
for
god
sake
isaac
not
that
do
you
hear
not
that
my
god
i
did
mean
to
i
did
know
what
i
was
doing
jimmie
dale
crept
up
another
step
another
and
another
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
in
the
room
then
burton
again
isaac
i
make
good
to
you
some
other
way
i
swear
i
will
i
swear
it
if
i
caught
at
this
i
i
get
fifteen
years
for
and
which
would
you
rather
have
jimmie
dale
could
picture
the
oily
smirk
the
shrug
of
his
shoulders
the
outthrust
hands
palms
upward
elbows
in
at
the
hips
the
fingers
curved
and
wide
apart
fifteen
years
or
what
you
get
for
murder
eh
my
friend
you
have
thought
of
that
eh
it
is
a
very
little
price
i
ask
yes
damn
you
burton
voice
was
shrill
then
dropped
to
a
half
sob
no
no
isaac
i
did
mean
that
only
for
god
sake
be
merciful
it
is
not
only
the
risk
of
the
penitentiary
it
more
than
that
i
i
tried
to
play
white
all
my
life
and
until
that
cursed
night
there
no
man
living
could
say
i
have
you
know
that
you
know
that
isaac
i
tell
you
i
could
do
it
this
afternoon
i
tell
you
i
could
i
tried
to
and
and
i
jimmie
dale
was
lying
flat
on
the
little
landing
now
peering
into
the
room
back
a
short
distance
from
the
doorway
a
little
man
in
unkempt
clothes
and
soiled
linen
with
parchment
face
out
of
which
small
black
eyes
shone
cunningly
and
shrewdly
sat
at
a
bare
deal
table
in
a
rickety
chair
facing
him
across
the
table
stood
a
young
man
of
not
more
than
clean
cut
well
dressed
but
whose
face
was
unnaturally
white
now
and
whose
hand
as
he
extended
it
in
a
pleading
gesture
toward
the
other
trembled
visibly
jimmie
dale
hand
made
its
way
quietly
to
his
side
pocket
and
extracted
his
automatic
old
isaac
humped
his
shoulders
and
leered
at
his
visitor
we
talk
a
great
deal
my
young
friend
what
is
the
use
a
bargain
is
a
bargain
a
few
rubies
in
exchange
for
your
life
a
few
rubies
and
my
mouth
is
shut
otherwise
he
humped
his
shoulders
again
well
burton
drew
back
swept
his
hand
in
a
dazed
way
across
his
eyes
and
laughed
out
suddenly
in
bitter
mirth
a
few
rubies
he
cried
the
most
magnificent
stones
on
this
side
of
the
water
a
few
rubies
it
been
maddon
life
hobby
every
child
in
new
york
knows
that
a
few
yes
there
only
a
few
but
those
few
are
worth
a
fortune
he
trusts
me
the
man
has
been
like
a
father
to
me
and
so
you
are
the
very
last
to
be
suspected
observed
old
isaac
suavely
have
i
not
told
you
that
there
is
nothing
to
fear
did
we
not
arrange
everything
so
nicely
eh
my
young
friend
see
it
was
that
maddon
gives
a
little
reception
to
his
friends
and
did
you
not
say
that
the
rubies
would
be
taken
from
the
vault
this
afternoon
since
his
friends
always
clamoured
to
see
them
as
a
very
fitting
conclusion
to
an
evening
entertainment
and
did
you
not
say
that
you
very
naturally
had
access
to
the
safe
in
the
library
where
you
worked
and
that
he
would
not
notice
they
were
gone
until
he
came
to
look
for
them
some
time
this
evening
i
think
you
said
all
that
and
what
suspicion
let
alone
proof
would
attach
itself
to
you
you
were
out
of
the
room
once
when
he
too
was
absent
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
it
is
very
simple
in
that
half
hour
some
one
somehow
abstracted
them
certainly
it
was
not
you
you
see
how
little
i
ask
and
i
pay
well
do
i
not
and
so
i
gave
you
until
three
days
have
gone
and
i
have
said
nothing
and
the
body
has
not
been
found
eh
but
eh
it
was
understood
the
rubies
or
the
burton
lips
moved
but
it
was
a
moment
before
he
could
speak
you
would
dare
he
whispered
thickly
you
would
dare
i
tell
the
story
of
of
what
you
tried
to
make
me
do
and
they
send
you
up
for
old
isaac
shrugged
with
pitying
contempt
is
it
after
all
a
fool
i
am
dealing
with
he
sneered
and
i
what
should
i
say
that
you
had
stolen
the
stones
from
your
employer
and
offered
them
as
a
bribe
to
silence
me
and
that
i
had
refused
the
very
act
of
handing
you
over
to
the
police
would
prove
the
truth
of
what
i
said
and
rob
you
of
even
a
chance
of
leniency
for
that
other
thing
is
it
not
so
eh
and
why
did
i
not
hand
you
over
at
once
three
nights
ago
believe
me
my
young
friend
i
should
have
a
very
good
reason
ready
a
dozen
if
necessary
if
it
came
to
that
but
we
are
borrowing
trouble
are
we
not
we
shall
not
come
to
that
eh
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
jimmie
dale
as
he
watched
that
burton
would
hurl
himself
upon
the
other
white
to
the
lips
the
muscles
of
his
face
twitching
burton
clenched
his
fists
and
leaned
over
the
table
and
then
with
sudden
revulsion
of
emotion
he
drew
back
once
more
and
once
more
came
that
choked
sob
you
pay
for
this
isaac
your
turn
will
come
for
this
i
have
been
threatened
very
often
snapped
the
other
contemptuously
bah
what
are
threats
i
laugh
at
them
as
i
always
then
with
a
quick
change
of
front
his
voice
a
sudden
snarl
well
we
have
talked
enough
you
have
your
choice
the
stones
or
eh
and
it
is
now
the
old
pawnbroker
sprawled
back
in
his
chair
a
cunning
leer
on
his
vicious
face
a
gleam
of
triumph
greed
in
the
beady
ratlike
eyes
that
never
wavered
from
the
other
burton
moisture
oozing
from
his
forehead
stood
there
hesitant
staring
back
at
old
isaac
half
in
a
fascinated
gaze
half
as
though
trying
to
read
some
sign
of
weakness
in
the
bestial
countenance
that
confronted
him
and
then
very
slowly
in
an
automatic
way
his
hand
groped
into
the
inside
pocket
of
his
vest
and
old
isaac
cackled
out
in
derision
so
you
thought
you
could
bluff
me
eh
you
thought
you
could
fool
old
isaac
bah
i
read
you
like
a
book
did
i
not
tell
you
a
while
back
that
you
had
them
in
your
pocket
i
know
your
kind
my
young
friend
i
know
your
kind
very
well
indeed
it
is
my
business
you
would
not
have
dared
to
come
here
without
the
price
so
you
took
them
this
afternoon
as
we
agreed
yes
yes
you
did
well
you
will
not
regret
it
and
now
let
me
see
them
his
voice
rose
eagerly
let
me
see
them
now
my
young
yes
i
took
burton
spoke
listlessly
god
help
me
old
isaac
quivering
excited
like
a
different
creature
now
sprang
from
his
chair
and
as
burton
drew
a
long
flat
leather
case
from
his
pocket
snatched
it
from
the
other
hand
his
fingers
in
their
rapacious
haste
could
not
at
first
manipulate
the
catch
and
then
finally
with
the
case
open
he
bent
over
the
table
feverishly
the
light
reflected
back
as
from
some
living
mass
of
crimson
fire
now
shading
darkly
now
glowing
into
wondrous
colourful
transparency
as
he
moved
the
case
to
and
fro
with
jerky
motions
of
his
hands
and
he
was
babbling
crooning
to
himself
like
one
possessed
ah
the
little
beauties
ah
the
pretty
little
things
yes
yes
these
are
the
ones
this
is
the
great
aracon
see
see
the
prism
terminated
by
the
pyramid
but
it
must
be
cut
it
must
be
cut
to
sell
it
eh
ah
it
is
too
bad
too
bad
and
this
this
one
here
i
know
them
all
this
is
but
his
sentence
was
never
finished
it
was
jimmie
dale
on
his
feet
now
leaning
against
the
jamb
of
the
door
his
automatic
covering
the
two
men
at
the
table
who
spoke
quite
so
isaac
he
said
coolly
you
know
them
all
quite
so
isaac
but
be
good
enough
to
drop
them
the
case
fell
from
isaac
hand
the
flush
on
his
cheeks
died
to
a
sickly
pallor
and
his
mouth
half
open
he
stood
like
a
man
turned
to
stone
his
hands
with
curved
fingers
still
outstretched
over
the
table
over
the
crimson
gems
that
spilled
from
the
case
lay
scattered
now
on
the
tabletop
burton
neither
spoke
nor
moved
a
little
whiter
the
misery
in
his
face
almost
apathetic
he
moistened
his
lips
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
jimmie
dale
walked
across
the
room
halted
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
surveyed
the
two
men
grimly
and
then
while
one
hand
with
revolver
extended
rested
easily
on
the
table
the
other
gathered
up
the
stones
placed
them
in
the
case
and
the
case
in
his
pocket
jimmie
dale
lips
parted
in
an
uninviting
smile
i
guess
i
in
luck
eh
isaac
he
drawled
between
you
and
your
young
friend
as
i
believe
you
call
him
it
would
appear
as
though
i
had
fallen
on
my
feet
that
aracon
worth
what
would
you
say
a
hundred
two
hundred
thousand
alone
eh
a
very
famous
stone
that
had
your
eye
on
it
for
quite
a
time
isaac
you
miserable
blood
leech
eh
isaac
did
not
answer
but
while
he
still
held
back
from
the
table
he
seemed
to
be
regaining
a
little
of
his
composure
burglars
of
whatever
sort
were
no
novelty
to
him
and
was
staring
fixedly
at
jimmie
dale
ca
place
me
though
there
not
many
in
the
profession
you
know
is
that
it
inquired
jimmie
dale
softly
well
do
try
isaac
it
hardly
worth
your
while
i
got
the
stones
now
and
wait
wait
listen
it
was
burton
speaking
for
the
first
time
his
words
coming
in
a
quick
nervous
rush
listen
you
do
hold
your
tongue
cried
old
isaac
with
sudden
fierceness
you
are
a
fool
he
leaned
toward
jimmie
dale
a
crafty
smile
on
his
face
quite
in
control
of
himself
once
more
do
listen
to
him
listen
to
me
you
right
i
ca
place
you
and
it
does
make
any
difference
he
took
a
step
forward
but
not
too
close
isaac
snapped
jimmie
dale
sharply
i
know
you
so
ejaculated
old
isaac
rubbing
his
hands
together
so
that
is
good
that
is
what
i
want
listen
we
will
make
a
bargain
we
are
birds
of
a
feather
eh
all
thieves
eh
you
got
the
drop
on
us
who
did
all
the
work
but
you
give
us
our
share
eh
listen
you
could
get
rid
of
those
stones
alone
you
know
that
you
not
so
green
at
the
game
eh
you
have
to
go
to
some
one
you
know
me
you
know
old
isaac
you
say
well
then
you
know
there
is
another
man
in
new
york
could
dispose
of
those
rubies
and
play
safe
doing
it
except
me
i
make
a
good
bargain
with
isaac
said
jimmie
dale
pensively
you
made
a
good
many
bargains
i
wonder
when
you
make
your
last
there
more
than
one
looking
for
on
those
bargains
in
a
pretty
grim
sort
of
bah
ejaculated
old
isaac
it
is
an
old
story
they
are
all
alike
i
am
afraid
of
none
of
them
i
hold
them
all
like
that
his
hand
opened
and
closed
like
a
taloned
claw
and
you
add
me
to
the
lot
eh
said
jimmie
dale
he
lifted
the
revolver
its
muzzle
on
old
isaac
examined
the
mechanism
thoughtfully
and
lowered
it
again
very
well
i
make
a
bargain
with
you
providing
it
is
agreeable
to
your
young
friend
ah
exclaimed
old
isaac
shrilly
so
that
is
good
it
is
done
he
chuckled
hoarsely
any
bargain
i
make
he
will
agree
to
is
it
not
so
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
burton
well
is
it
not
so
speak
up
say
he
stopped
the
words
cut
short
off
on
his
lips
it
came
without
warning
a
crash
a
pound
on
the
door
below
another
burton
shrank
back
against
the
wall
my
god
the
police
he
gasped
maddon
found
out
we
caught
jimmie
dale
eyes
on
old
isaac
narrowed
the
pounding
in
the
alleyway
grew
louder
more
insistent
and
then
his
first
suspicion
passed
it
was
no
game
of
isaac
crafty
though
the
old
fox
was
the
surprise
and
agitation
was
too
genuine
to
be
questioned
still
the
pounding
continued
some
one
was
kicking
viciously
at
the
door
and
banging
a
tattoo
on
the
panels
with
his
fists
old
isaac
clawlike
hands
doubled
suddenly
it
is
some
drunken
sot
he
snarled
out
that
knows
no
better
than
to
come
here
and
rouse
the
whole
neighbourhood
it
is
true
in
a
moment
we
will
have
the
police
running
in
from
the
street
but
wait
wait
teach
the
fool
a
lesson
he
dashed
around
the
table
ran
for
the
window
wrenched
the
catch
up
flung
the
window
open
and
snarling
again
leaned
out
and
instantly
the
knocking
ceased
and
instantly
then
with
a
sharp
cry
as
the
whole
ghastly
meaning
of
it
swept
upon
him
jimmie
sprang
after
the
other
too
late
came
the
roar
of
a
revolver
shot
a
stream
of
flame
cutting
the
darkness
of
the
alleyway
from
the
window
in
the
house
opposite
and
without
a
sound
old
isaac
crumpled
up
hung
limply
for
a
moment
over
the
sill
and
slid
in
a
heap
to
the
floor
on
his
hands
and
knees
protected
from
the
possibility
of
another
bullet
by
the
height
of
the
sill
jimmie
dale
quick
in
every
movement
now
dragged
the
inert
form
toward
the
table
away
from
the
window
and
bent
hurriedly
over
the
other
a
minute
perhaps
he
stayed
there
and
then
rose
slowly
burton
unmanned
beside
himself
was
hanging
clutching
with
both
hands
at
the
table
edge
he
dead
said
jimmie
dale
laconically
burton
flung
out
his
hands
dead
he
whispered
hoarsely
i
i
think
i
going
mad
three
days
of
hell
and
now
this
we
we
better
get
out
of
here
quick
they
get
us
if
jimmie
dale
hand
fell
with
a
tight
grip
on
burton
shoulder
there
wo
be
any
more
shots
fired
pull
yourself
together
burton
stared
at
him
in
a
demented
way
what
what
it
mean
he
stammered
it
means
that
i
did
put
two
and
two
together
said
jimmie
dale
a
little
bitterly
it
means
that
there
a
dozen
crooks
been
dancing
old
isaac
tune
for
a
long
time
and
that
some
of
them
have
got
him
at
burton
reached
out
suddenly
and
clutched
jimmie
dale
arm
then
i
safe
he
mumbled
the
words
but
there
was
dawning
hope
relief
in
his
white
face
safe
i
safe
if
you
only
give
me
back
those
stones
give
them
back
to
me
for
god
sake
give
them
back
to
me
you
do
know
you
do
understand
i
stole
them
because
because
he
made
me
because
i
it
was
the
only
chance
i
had
oh
my
god
you
know
what
the
last
three
days
have
been
give
them
back
to
me
you
wo
you
you
you
do
know
do
lose
your
nerve
said
jimmie
dale
sharply
sit
down
he
pushed
the
other
into
the
chair
there
no
one
will
disturb
us
here
for
some
time
at
least
what
is
it
that
i
do
know
that
three
nights
ago
you
were
in
a
gambling
hell
sagosto
to
be
exact
one
of
the
most
disreputable
in
new
york
and
you
went
there
on
the
invitation
of
a
stray
acquaintance
a
man
named
perley
shall
i
describe
him
for
you
a
short
man
black
eyes
red
hair
beard
and
you
know
that
the
misery
the
hopelessness
was
back
in
burton
face
again
and
suddenly
he
bent
over
the
table
and
buried
his
head
in
his
outflung
arms
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
jimmie
dale
eyes
travelled
from
burton
shaking
shoulders
to
the
motionless
form
on
the
floor
then
he
spoke
again
you
a
bit
of
a
rounder
burton
but
i
think
you
had
a
lesson
that
will
last
you
all
your
life
you
were
when
you
and
perley
began
to
hobnob
over
a
downtown
bar
he
said
he
show
you
some
real
life
and
you
went
with
him
to
sagosto
he
gave
you
a
revolver
before
you
went
in
and
told
you
the
place
was
safe
for
an
unarmed
man
he
introduced
you
to
sagosto
the
proprietor
and
you
were
shown
to
a
back
room
you
drank
quite
a
little
there
you
and
perley
were
alone
throwing
dice
you
got
into
a
quarrel
perley
tried
to
draw
his
revolver
you
were
quicker
you
drew
the
one
he
had
given
you
and
fired
he
fell
to
the
floor
you
saw
the
blood
gush
from
his
breast
just
above
the
heart
he
was
dead
in
a
panic
you
rushed
from
the
place
and
out
into
the
street
i
do
think
you
went
home
that
burton
raised
his
head
showing
his
haggard
face
i
guess
it
no
use
he
said
dully
if
you
know
others
must
i
thought
only
isaac
and
sagosto
knew
why
have
i
been
arrested
i
wish
to
god
i
had
i
would
have
had
to
answer
i
am
not
through
yet
said
jimmie
dale
gravely
the
next
day
old
isaac
here
sent
for
you
he
said
sagosto
had
told
him
of
the
murder
and
had
offered
to
dispose
of
the
corpse
and
keep
his
mouth
shut
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
that
no
one
in
his
place
knew
of
it
except
himself
isaac
for
his
share
wanted
considerably
more
you
told
him
you
had
no
such
sums
that
you
had
no
money
he
told
you
how
you
could
get
it
you
had
access
to
maddon
safe
you
were
maddon
confidential
secretary
fully
in
your
employer
trust
the
last
man
on
earth
to
be
suspected
and
there
were
maddon
famous
priceless
jimmie
dale
paused
burton
made
no
answer
and
so
said
jimmie
dale
presently
to
save
yourself
from
the
death
penalty
you
took
yes
said
burton
scarcely
above
his
breath
are
you
an
officer
if
you
are
take
me
have
done
with
it
only
for
heaven
sake
end
it
if
you
not
jimmie
dale
was
not
listening
the
cupboard
at
the
rear
of
the
room
she
had
said
he
walked
across
to
it
now
opened
it
and
after
a
little
search
found
a
small
bundle
he
returned
with
it
in
his
hand
and
kneeling
beside
the
dead
man
on
the
floor
his
back
to
burton
untied
it
took
out
a
red
wig
and
beard
and
slipped
them
on
to
old
head
and
face
i
wonder
he
said
grimly
as
he
stood
up
if
you
ever
saw
this
man
before
my
god
perley
with
a
wild
cry
burton
was
on
his
feet
straining
forward
like
a
man
crazed
yes
said
jimmie
dale
perley
sort
of
an
ironic
justice
in
his
end
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
is
there
i
think
we
leave
him
like
that
as
perley
it
will
provide
the
police
with
an
interesting
little
problem
which
they
will
never
solve
and
steady
burton
was
rocking
on
his
feet
the
tears
were
streaming
down
his
face
he
lurched
heavily
and
jimmie
dale
caught
him
and
pushed
him
back
into
the
chair
again
i
thought
i
thought
there
was
blood
on
my
hands
said
burton
brokenly
that
that
i
had
taken
a
man
life
it
was
horrible
horrible
lived
through
three
days
that
i
thought
would
drive
me
mad
while
i
i
tried
to
do
my
work
and
and
talk
to
people
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
every
one
that
spoke
to
me
seemed
so
carefree
and
happy
and
i
would
have
sold
my
soul
to
have
changed
places
with
he
stared
at
the
form
on
the
floor
and
shivered
suddenly
it
it
was
like
that
i
saw
him
last
he
whispered
but
but
i
do
not
jimmie
dale
smiled
a
little
wearily
it
was
simple
enough
he
said
old
isaac
had
had
his
eyes
on
those
rubies
for
a
long
time
the
easiest
way
of
getting
them
was
through
you
the
revolver
he
gave
you
before
you
entered
sagosto
was
loaded
with
blank
cartridges
the
blood
you
saw
was
the
old
old
trick
a
punctured
bladder
of
red
pigment
concealed
under
the
let
us
get
out
of
here
burton
shuddered
again
let
us
get
out
of
here
at
once
now
if
we
found
here
we
be
accused
of
that
there
is
no
hurry
jimmie
dale
answered
quietly
i
have
told
you
that
no
one
is
liable
to
come
here
and
whoever
did
this
certainly
will
not
raise
an
alarm
and
besides
there
is
still
the
matter
of
the
rubies
yes
said
burton
with
a
quick
intake
of
his
breath
yes
the
rubies
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
i
i
had
forgotten
them
you
he
stopped
stared
at
jimmie
dale
and
burst
into
a
miserable
laugh
i
a
fool
a
blind
fool
he
moaned
it
does
not
matter
what
you
do
with
them
i
forgot
sagosto
when
they
find
isaac
here
sagosto
will
either
tell
his
story
which
will
be
enough
to
convict
me
of
this
night
work
the
real
murder
even
though
innocent
or
else
he
blackmail
me
just
as
isaac
jimmie
dale
shook
his
head
you
are
doing
isaac
cunning
an
injustice
he
said
grimly
sagosto
was
only
a
tool
one
of
many
that
old
isaac
had
in
his
power
and
for
that
matter
as
likely
as
any
one
else
to
have
had
a
hand
in
murder
sagosto
saw
you
once
when
isaac
brought
you
into
his
place
not
because
isaac
wanted
sagosto
to
see
you
but
because
he
wanted
you
to
see
sagosto
do
you
understand
it
would
make
the
story
that
sagosto
came
to
him
with
the
tale
of
the
murder
the
next
day
ring
true
sagosto
however
did
not
go
to
old
isaac
the
next
day
to
tell
about
any
fake
murder
naturally
sagosto
would
not
know
you
again
from
adam
neither
does
he
know
anything
about
the
rubies
nor
what
old
isaac
ulterior
motives
were
he
was
paid
for
his
share
in
the
game
in
old
isaac
usual
manner
of
payment
probably
by
a
threat
of
exposure
for
some
offence
that
isaac
held
over
him
if
he
did
keep
his
mouth
burton
hand
brushed
his
eyes
yes
he
muttered
yes
i
see
it
jimmie
dale
stooped
down
picked
up
the
paper
from
the
floor
in
which
the
wig
and
beard
had
been
wrapped
walked
back
with
it
and
replaced
it
in
the
cupboard
and
then
with
his
back
to
burton
again
he
took
the
case
of
gems
from
his
pocket
opened
it
and
laid
it
on
the
cupboard
shelf
also
from
his
pocket
came
that
thin
metal
case
and
from
the
case
with
a
pair
of
tweezers
that
obviated
the
possibility
of
telltale
finger
prints
a
gray
piece
of
paper
adhesive
on
one
side
that
cursed
by
the
distracted
authorities
in
every
police
headquarters
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
and
raved
at
by
a
virulent
press
whose
printed
reproductions
had
made
it
familiar
in
every
household
in
the
land
was
the
insignia
of
the
gray
seal
he
moistened
the
adhesive
side
dropped
it
from
the
tweezers
to
his
handkerchief
and
pressed
it
down
firmly
on
the
inside
of
the
cover
of
the
jewel
case
he
put
both
cases
back
in
his
pockets
and
returned
to
burton
burton
he
said
a
little
sharply
while
i
was
outside
that
doorway
there
i
heard
you
beg
old
isaac
to
let
you
keep
the
rubies
and
three
times
already
you
have
asked
the
same
of
me
what
would
you
do
with
them
if
i
gave
them
back
to
you
burton
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
he
was
gazing
at
the
masked
face
in
a
way
you
you
mean
you
will
give
them
back
he
burst
out
finally
answer
my
question
prompted
jimmie
dale
do
with
them
burton
repeated
slowly
why
i
told
you
they
go
back
to
maddon
i
take
them
would
you
jimmie
dale
voice
was
quizzical
a
puzzled
expression
came
to
burton
face
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
that
he
said
of
course
i
would
how
asked
jimmie
dale
do
you
know
the
combination
of
safe
no
said
burton
and
the
safe
would
be
locked
would
it
quite
so
said
jimmie
dale
musingly
then
granted
that
maddon
has
not
already
discovered
the
theft
how
would
you
replace
the
stones
before
he
does
discover
it
and
if
he
already
knows
that
they
are
gone
how
would
you
get
them
back
into
his
hands
yes
i
know
burton
answered
a
little
listlessly
i
thought
of
that
there
only
one
way
to
take
them
back
to
him
myself
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
he
hesitated
and
tell
him
you
stole
them
supplied
jimmie
dale
burton
nodded
his
head
yes
he
said
and
then
prodded
jimmie
dale
what
will
maddon
do
from
what
heard
of
him
he
not
a
man
to
trifle
with
nor
a
man
to
take
an
overly
complacent
view
of
things
not
the
man
whose
philosophy
is
well
that
ends
well
what
does
it
matter
burton
voice
was
low
it
is
that
so
much
i
ready
for
that
it
the
fact
that
he
trusted
me
implicitly
and
i
well
i
played
the
fool
or
i
never
have
got
into
a
mess
like
for
an
instant
jimmie
dale
looked
at
the
other
searchingly
and
then
smiling
strangely
he
shook
his
head
there
a
better
way
than
that
burton
he
said
quietly
i
think
as
i
said
before
you
had
a
lesson
that
will
last
you
all
your
life
i
going
to
give
you
another
chance
with
maddon
here
are
the
he
reached
into
his
pocket
and
laid
the
case
on
the
table
but
now
burton
made
no
effort
to
take
the
case
his
eyes
in
that
puzzled
way
again
were
on
jimmie
dale
a
better
way
he
repeated
tensely
what
do
you
mean
what
way
well
say
at
the
expense
of
another
man
reputation
of
mine
suggested
jimmie
dale
with
his
whimsical
smile
you
need
only
say
that
a
man
came
to
you
this
evening
told
you
that
he
stole
these
rubies
from
maddon
during
the
afternoon
and
asked
you
as
maddon
private
secretary
to
restore
them
with
his
compliments
to
their
a
slow
flush
of
disappointment
deepening
to
one
of
anger
dyed
cheeks
are
you
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
me
he
cried
out
go
to
maddon
with
a
childish
tale
like
that
there
no
man
living
would
believe
such
a
story
no
inquired
jimmie
dale
softly
and
yet
i
am
inclined
to
think
there
are
a
good
many
that
even
maddon
would
as
he
is
you
might
say
that
when
the
man
handed
you
the
case
you
thought
it
was
some
practical
joke
being
foisted
on
you
until
you
opened
the
case
jimmie
dale
pushed
it
a
little
farther
across
the
table
and
burton
mechanically
his
eyes
still
on
jimme
dale
loosened
the
catch
with
his
thumb
nail
until
you
opened
the
case
saw
the
rubies
and
the
gray
seal
burton
had
snatched
the
case
toward
him
and
was
straining
his
eyes
at
the
inside
cover
you
the
gray
seal
well
said
jimmie
dale
whimsically
motionless
the
case
held
open
in
his
hands
burton
stood
there
the
gray
seal
he
whispered
then
with
a
catch
in
his
voice
you
mean
this
you
mean
to
let
me
have
these
back
you
mean
you
mean
all
you
said
for
god
sake
do
play
with
me
the
gray
seal
the
most
notorious
criminal
in
the
country
to
give
back
a
fortune
like
this
you
you
dog
with
a
bad
name
said
jimmie
dale
with
a
wry
smile
then
a
little
gruffly
put
it
in
your
pocket
slowly
almost
as
though
he
expected
the
case
to
be
snatched
back
from
him
the
next
instant
burton
obeyed
i
do
understand
i
ca
understand
he
murmured
they
say
that
you
and
yet
i
believe
you
now
you
saved
me
from
a
ruined
life
the
gray
seal
if
if
every
one
knew
what
you
had
done
they
but
every
one
wo
jimmie
dale
broke
in
bluntly
who
is
to
tell
them
you
you
could
very
well
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
could
you
well
who
knows
perhaps
there
have
been
others
like
you
you
mean
said
burton
excitedly
you
mean
that
all
these
crimes
of
yours
that
have
seemed
without
motive
that
have
been
so
inexplicable
have
really
been
like
to
i
do
mean
anything
at
all
interposed
jimmie
dale
a
little
hurriedly
nothing
burton
except
that
there
is
still
one
little
thing
more
to
do
to
bolster
up
that
story
of
mine
and
then
get
out
of
he
glanced
sharply
critically
around
the
room
his
eyes
resting
for
a
moment
at
the
last
on
the
form
on
the
floor
then
tersely
i
am
going
to
turn
out
the
light
we
will
have
to
pass
the
window
to
get
to
the
door
and
we
will
invite
no
chances
are
you
ready
no
not
yet
said
burton
eagerly
i
have
said
what
i
like
to
say
to
you
what
i
walk
straight
to
the
door
said
jimmie
dale
curtly
there
was
the
click
of
an
switch
and
the
room
was
in
darkness
now
no
noise
he
instructed
and
burton
perforce
made
his
way
across
the
room
and
at
the
door
jimmie
dale
joined
him
and
led
him
down
the
short
flight
of
stairs
at
the
bottom
he
opened
the
door
leading
into
the
rear
of
the
pawnshop
itself
and
bidding
burton
follow
entered
we
ca
risk
even
a
match
it
could
be
seen
from
the
street
he
said
brusquely
as
he
fumbled
around
for
a
moment
in
the
darkness
ah
here
it
is
he
lifted
a
telephone
receiver
from
its
hook
and
gave
a
number
burton
caught
him
quickly
by
the
arm
good
lord
man
what
are
you
doing
he
protested
anxiously
maddon
house
so
i
believe
said
jimmie
dale
complacently
hello
is
maddon
there
i
beg
pardon
personally
yes
if
you
there
was
a
moment
wait
burton
hand
was
still
nervously
clutching
at
jimmie
dale
sleeve
then
mr
maddon
asked
jimmie
dale
pleasantly
yes
i
am
very
sorry
to
trouble
you
but
i
called
you
up
to
inquire
if
you
were
aware
that
your
rubies
and
among
them
your
aracon
had
been
stolen
i
beg
pardon
rubies
yes
you
were
oh
no
i
am
quite
in
my
right
mind
if
you
will
take
the
trouble
to
open
your
safe
you
will
find
they
are
gone
shall
i
hold
the
line
while
you
investigate
what
do
shout
please
and
stand
a
little
farther
away
from
the
jimmie
dale
tone
was
one
of
insolent
composure
now
there
is
really
no
use
in
getting
excited
i
beg
pardon
certainly
this
is
the
gray
seal
speaking
what
jimmie
voice
grew
plaintive
i
really
ca
make
out
a
word
when
you
yell
like
that
yes
i
had
occasion
to
use
them
this
afternoon
and
i
took
the
liberty
of
borrowing
them
temporarily
are
you
still
there
maddon
oh
quite
so
yes
i
hear
you
now
no
that
is
all
only
i
am
returning
them
through
your
private
secretary
a
very
estimable
young
man
though
i
fear
somewhat
excitable
and
shaky
who
is
on
his
way
to
you
with
them
now
what
that
you
say
you
repeat
that
snapped
jimmie
dale
suddenly
icily
and
i
take
them
from
under
your
nose
again
before
morning
ah
that
is
better
jimmie
dale
hung
up
the
receiver
and
shoved
burton
toward
the
door
now
then
burton
we
get
out
of
her
and
the
sooner
you
reach
fifth
avenue
and
maddon
house
the
better
no
not
that
way
they
had
reached
the
hall
and
burton
had
turned
toward
the
side
door
that
opened
on
the
alleyway
whoever
they
were
who
settled
their
last
account
with
isaac
may
still
be
watching
they
nothing
against
any
one
else
but
they
know
some
one
was
in
here
at
the
time
and
if
the
police
are
clever
enough
ever
to
get
on
their
track
they
might
find
it
very
convenient
to
be
able
to
say
who
was
in
the
room
when
isaac
was
murdered
there
nothing
to
show
since
isaac
so
obligingly
opened
the
window
for
them
that
the
shot
was
fired
through
the
window
and
not
from
the
inside
of
the
room
and
even
if
they
have
already
taken
to
their
heels
jimmie
dale
was
leading
burton
up
the
stairs
again
as
he
talked
it
might
prove
exceedingly
inconvenient
for
us
if
some
should
happen
to
recollect
that
he
saw
two
men
of
our
general
appearance
leaving
the
premises
now
keep
close
and
follow
they
passed
the
door
of
isaac
den
turned
down
a
narrow
corridor
that
led
to
the
rear
of
the
house
jimmie
dale
guiding
unerringly
working
from
the
mental
map
of
the
house
that
the
tocsin
had
drawn
for
him
descended
another
short
flight
of
stairs
that
gave
on
the
kitchen
crossed
the
kitchen
and
jimmie
dale
opened
a
back
door
he
paused
here
for
a
moment
to
listen
then
cautioning
burton
to
be
silent
moved
on
again
across
a
small
back
yard
and
through
a
gate
into
a
lane
that
ran
at
right
angles
to
the
alleyway
by
which
both
had
entered
the
house
and
a
minute
later
they
were
crouched
against
a
building
a
half
block
away
where
the
lane
intersected
the
cross
street
here
jimmie
dale
peered
out
cautiously
there
was
no
one
in
sight
he
touched
burton
shoulder
and
pointed
down
the
street
that
your
way
burton
mine
the
other
hurry
while
you
got
the
chance
burton
hand
reached
out
caught
jimmie
dale
and
wrung
it
god
bless
you
he
said
huskily
i
and
jimmie
dale
pushed
him
out
on
to
the
street
burton
steps
receded
down
the
sidewalk
jimmie
dale
still
crouched
against
the
wall
the
steps
grew
fainter
in
the
distance
and
died
finally
away
jimmie
dale
straightened
up
slipped
the
mask
from
his
face
to
his
pocket
stepped
out
on
the
street
and
five
minutes
later
was
passing
through
the
noisy
bedlam
of
the
hungarian
restaurant
on
his
way
to
the
front
door
and
his
car
sonnez
le
tocsin
jimmie
dale
was
saying
softly
to
himself
i
wonder
what
she
do
when
she
finds
i
got
the
ring
chapter
viii
the
man
higher
up
the
tocsin
by
neither
act
sign
nor
word
had
she
evidenced
the
slightest
interest
in
that
ring
and
yet
she
must
know
she
certainly
must
know
that
it
was
now
in
his
possession
jimmie
dale
was
disappointed
somehow
he
had
counted
more
than
he
had
cared
to
admit
on
developments
from
that
ring
he
pulled
a
little
viciously
at
his
cigarette
as
he
stared
out
of
the
james
club
window
that
was
how
long
ago
ten
days
yes
this
would
be
the
eleventh
eleven
days
now
and
no
word
from
her
eleven
days
since
that
night
at
old
isaac
since
she
had
last
called
him
the
gray
seal
to
arms
it
was
a
long
while
so
long
a
while
even
that
what
had
come
to
be
his
prerogative
in
the
newspapers
the
front
page
with
type
recounting
some
new
exploit
of
that
mysterious
criminal
the
gray
seal
was
being
usurped
the
papers
were
howling
now
about
what
they
for
the
lack
of
a
better
term
were
pleased
to
call
a
wave
of
crime
that
had
inundated
new
york
and
of
which
for
once
the
gray
seal
was
not
the
storm
centre
but
rather
for
the
moment
forgotten
he
drew
back
from
the
window
and
settling
himself
again
in
the
big
leather
lounging
chair
resumed
the
perusal
of
the
evening
paper
his
eye
fell
on
what
was
common
to
every
edition
now
a
crime
editorial
and
the
paper
crackled
suddenly
under
the
long
slim
tapering
fingers
so
carefully
nurtured
whose
sensitive
tips
a
hundred
times
had
made
mockery
of
the
human
ingenuity
squandered
on
the
intricate
mechanism
of
safes
and
vaults
no
he
was
wrong
the
gray
seal
had
not
been
forgotten
we
should
not
be
surprised
wrote
the
editor
virulently
to
discover
at
the
bottom
of
these
abominable
atrocities
that
the
guiding
spirit
in
fact
was
the
gray
seal
they
are
quite
worthy
even
of
his
diabolical
disregard
for
the
laws
of
god
and
jimmie
dale
lips
straightened
ominously
and
an
angry
glint
crept
into
his
dark
steady
eyes
there
was
nothing
then
nothing
too
vile
that
in
the
public
eyes
could
not
logically
be
associated
with
the
gray
seal
even
this
a
series
of
the
most
callous
murders
and
robberies
the
work
on
the
face
of
it
of
a
band
of
thugs
brutal
insensate
little
better
than
fiends
though
clever
enough
so
far
to
have
evaded
capture
clever
enough
indeed
to
have
kept
the
police
still
staggering
and
gasping
after
a
clew
for
one
murder
while
another
was
in
the
very
act
of
being
committed
the
gray
seal
what
exquisite
irony
and
yet
after
all
the
papers
were
not
wholly
to
blame
for
what
they
said
he
had
invited
much
of
it
seeming
crimes
of
the
gray
seal
had
apparently
been
genuine
beyond
any
question
of
doubt
as
he
had
intended
them
to
appear
as
in
the
very
essence
of
their
purpose
they
had
to
be
yes
he
had
invited
much
he
and
she
together
the
tocsin
and
himself
he
jimmie
dale
millionaire
clubman
whose
name
for
generations
in
new
york
had
been
the
family
pride
was
wanted
as
the
gray
seal
for
so
many
crimes
that
he
had
lost
track
of
them
himself
but
from
any
one
of
which
let
the
identity
of
the
gray
seal
be
once
solved
there
was
and
could
be
no
escape
what
exquisite
irony
yet
full
too
of
the
most
deadly
consequences
once
more
jimmie
dale
eyes
sought
the
paper
and
this
time
scanned
the
headlines
of
the
first
page
brutal
murder
of
mill
paymaster
the
crime
wave
still
at
its
height
herman
roessle
found
dead
near
his
car
assassins
escape
with
jimmie
dale
read
on
and
as
he
read
there
came
again
that
angry
set
to
his
lips
the
details
were
not
pleasant
herman
roessle
the
paymaster
of
the
mills
whose
plant
was
on
the
hudson
had
gone
that
morning
in
his
runabout
to
the
nearest
town
three
miles
away
for
the
monthly
pay
roll
had
secured
the
money
from
the
bank
a
sum
of
thousand
dollars
and
had
started
back
with
it
for
the
mill
at
first
it
being
broad
daylight
and
a
road
his
nonappearance
caused
no
apprehension
but
as
early
afternoon
came
and
there
was
still
no
sign
of
roessle
the
mill
management
took
alarm
discovering
that
he
had
left
the
bank
for
the
return
journey
at
a
few
minutes
before
eleven
and
that
nothing
had
been
seen
of
him
at
his
home
the
police
were
notified
followed
then
several
hours
of
fruitless
search
until
finally
with
the
whole
countryside
aroused
and
the
efforts
of
the
police
augumented
by
private
search
parties
the
car
was
found
in
a
thicket
at
the
edge
of
a
crossroad
some
four
miles
back
from
the
river
and
a
little
way
from
the
car
the
body
of
roessle
dead
the
man
head
crushed
in
where
it
had
been
fiendishly
battered
by
some
blunt
heavy
object
there
was
no
clew
no
one
could
be
found
who
had
seen
the
car
on
the
crossroad
the
murderer
or
murderers
and
the
thousand
dollars
in
cash
had
disappeared
leaving
no
trace
behind
there
were
several
columns
of
this
which
jimmie
dale
skimmed
through
quickly
but
at
the
end
he
stared
for
a
long
time
at
the
last
paragraph
somehow
strange
to
relate
the
paper
had
neglected
to
turn
its
sob
artist
loose
and
the
few
words
added
almost
as
though
they
were
an
afterthought
for
once
rang
true
and
full
of
pathos
in
their
very
simplicity
at
the
roessle
home
where
roessle
was
prostrated
two
little
tots
of
five
and
seven
too
young
to
understand
had
gravely
received
the
reporter
and
told
him
that
some
bad
man
had
hurt
their
daddy
mr
dale
sir
jimmie
dale
lowered
his
paper
a
club
attendant
was
standing
before
him
respectfully
extending
a
silver
card
tray
from
the
man
jimmie
eyes
fixed
on
a
white
envelope
on
the
tray
one
glance
was
enough
it
was
hers
that
letter
the
tocsin
again
his
brain
seemed
suddenly
to
be
afire
and
he
could
feel
his
pulse
quicken
the
blood
begin
to
pound
in
fierce
throbs
at
his
heart
life
and
death
lay
in
that
white
unaddressed
envelope
danger
peril
it
was
always
life
and
death
for
those
were
the
stakes
for
which
the
tocsin
played
but
master
of
many
things
jimmie
dale
was
most
of
all
master
of
himself
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
moved
he
reached
nonchalantly
for
the
letter
thank
you
said
jimmie
dale
the
man
bowed
and
started
away
jimmie
dale
laid
the
envelope
on
the
arm
of
the
lounging
chair
the
man
had
reached
the
door
when
jimmie
dale
stopped
him
oh
by
the
way
said
jimmie
dale
languidly
where
did
this
come
from
your
chauffeur
sir
replied
the
other
your
chauffeur
gave
it
to
the
hall
porter
a
moment
ago
thank
you
said
jimmie
dale
again
the
door
closed
jimmie
dale
glanced
around
the
room
it
was
the
caution
of
habit
that
glance
the
habit
of
years
in
which
his
life
had
hung
on
little
things
he
was
alone
in
one
of
the
club
private
library
rooms
he
picked
up
the
envelope
tore
it
open
took
out
the
folded
sheets
inside
and
began
to
read
at
the
first
words
he
leaned
forward
suddenly
tense
in
his
chair
he
read
on
turning
the
pages
hurriedly
incredulity
amazement
and
finally
a
strange
menace
mirroring
itself
in
turn
upon
his
face
he
stood
up
the
letter
in
his
hand
my
god
whispered
jimmie
dale
it
was
a
call
to
arms
such
as
the
gray
seal
had
never
received
before
such
as
the
tocsin
had
never
made
before
and
if
it
were
true
it
true
he
laughed
aloud
a
little
gratingly
true
had
the
tocsin
astounding
unbelievable
mystifying
as
were
the
means
by
which
she
acquired
her
knowledge
not
only
of
this
but
of
countless
other
affairs
ever
by
so
much
as
the
smallest
detail
been
astray
if
it
were
true
he
pulled
out
his
watch
it
was
nine
benson
his
chauffeur
had
sent
the
letter
into
the
club
benson
had
been
waiting
outside
there
ever
since
dinner
jimmie
dale
for
the
first
time
since
the
first
communication
that
he
had
ever
received
from
the
tocsin
did
not
immediately
destroy
her
letter
now
he
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
and
stepped
quickly
from
the
room
in
the
cloakroom
downstairs
he
secured
his
hat
and
overcoat
and
though
it
was
a
warm
evening
put
on
the
latter
since
he
was
in
evening
clothes
then
walked
leisurely
out
of
the
club
at
the
curb
benson
the
chauffeur
sprang
from
his
seat
and
touching
his
cap
opened
the
door
of
a
luxurious
limousine
jimmie
dale
shook
his
head
i
shall
not
keep
you
waiting
any
longer
benson
he
said
you
may
take
the
car
home
and
put
it
up
i
shall
probably
be
late
very
good
sir
replied
the
chauffeur
you
sent
in
a
letter
a
moment
or
so
ago
benson
observed
jimmie
dale
casually
opening
his
cigarette
case
yes
sir
said
benson
i
hope
i
did
do
wrong
sir
he
said
it
was
important
and
that
you
were
to
have
it
at
he
jimmie
dale
was
lighting
his
cigarette
now
a
boy
sir
benson
amplified
i
could
get
anything
out
of
him
he
just
said
he
been
told
to
give
it
to
me
and
tell
me
to
see
that
you
got
it
at
once
i
hope
sir
i
have
not
at
all
benson
said
jimmie
dale
pleasantly
it
quite
all
right
sir
benson
answered
climbing
back
to
his
seat
there
was
a
queer
little
smile
on
jimmie
dale
lips
as
he
watched
the
great
car
swing
around
in
the
street
and
glide
noiselessly
away
a
queer
little
smile
that
still
held
there
even
after
he
himself
had
started
briskly
along
the
avenue
in
a
downtown
direction
it
was
invariably
the
same
always
the
same
the
letters
came
unexpectedly
when
least
looked
for
now
by
this
means
now
by
that
but
always
in
a
manner
that
precluded
the
slightest
possibility
of
tracing
them
to
their
source
was
there
anything
in
his
intimate
surroundings
in
his
intimate
life
that
she
did
not
know
about
him
who
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
her
benson
for
instance
that
the
man
was
absolutely
trustworthy
or
else
she
would
never
for
an
instant
have
risked
the
letter
in
his
possession
was
there
anything
that
she
did
not
yes
one
thing
she
did
not
know
him
in
the
role
he
was
going
to
play
that
at
least
was
one
thing
that
surely
she
did
not
know
about
him
the
role
in
which
many
times
for
weeks
on
end
he
had
devoted
himself
body
and
soul
in
an
attempt
to
solve
the
mystery
with
which
she
surrounded
herself
the
role
too
that
often
enough
had
been
a
bulwark
of
safety
to
him
when
hard
pressed
by
the
police
the
role
out
of
which
he
had
so
carefully
so
painstakingly
created
a
now
recognised
and
character
of
the
underworld
the
role
of
larry
the
bat
jimmie
dale
turned
from
fifth
avenue
into
broadway
continued
on
down
broadway
across
to
the
bowery
kept
along
the
bowery
for
several
more
blocks
and
finally
headed
east
into
the
dimly
lighted
cross
street
on
which
the
sanctuary
was
located
and
now
jimmie
dale
became
cautious
in
his
movements
as
he
approached
the
black
alleyway
that
flanked
the
miserable
tenement
he
glanced
sharply
behind
and
about
him
and
at
the
alleyway
itself
without
pause
but
with
a
curious
side
step
no
longer
jimmie
dale
now
but
the
gray
seal
he
disappeared
from
the
street
and
was
lost
in
the
deep
shadows
of
the
building
in
a
moment
he
was
at
the
side
door
listening
for
any
sound
from
within
none
had
ever
seen
or
met
the
lodger
or
the
first
floor
either
ascending
or
descending
except
in
the
familiar
character
of
larry
the
bat
he
opened
the
door
closed
it
behind
him
and
in
the
utter
blackness
went
noiselessly
up
the
stairs
stairs
so
rickety
that
it
seemed
a
mouse
tread
alone
would
have
set
them
creaking
there
seemed
an
art
in
the
play
of
jimmie
dale
every
muscle
in
the
movements
lithe
balanced
quick
absolutely
silent
on
the
first
landing
he
stopped
before
another
door
there
was
the
faint
click
of
a
key
turning
in
the
lock
and
then
this
door
too
closed
behind
him
sounded
the
faint
click
of
the
key
as
it
turned
again
and
jimmie
dale
drew
a
long
breath
stepped
across
the
room
to
assure
himself
that
the
window
blind
was
down
and
lighted
the
gas
jet
a
yellow
murky
flame
spurted
up
pitifully
weak
almost
as
though
it
were
ashamed
of
its
disreputable
surroundings
dirt
disorder
squalour
the
evidence
of
low
living
testified
eloquently
enough
to
any
one
the
police
for
instance
in
times
past
inquisitive
until
they
were
fatuously
content
with
the
belief
that
they
knew
the
occupant
for
what
he
was
that
the
place
was
quite
in
keeping
with
its
tenant
a
mute
prototype
as
it
were
of
larry
the
bat
the
dope
fiend
for
a
little
space
jimmie
dale
immaculate
in
his
evening
clothes
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
miserable
room
his
dark
eyes
keen
alert
critical
sweeping
comprehensively
over
every
object
about
him
the
position
of
a
chair
of
a
cracked
drinking
glass
on
the
table
of
an
old
coat
thrown
with
apparent
carelessness
on
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
of
a
broken
bottle
that
had
innocently
strewn
some
sort
of
white
powder
close
to
the
threshold
inviting
unwary
foot
tracks
across
the
floor
and
then
taking
out
the
tocsin
letter
he
laid
it
upon
the
table
placed
what
money
he
had
in
his
pockets
beside
it
and
began
rapidly
to
remove
his
clothes
the
sanctuary
had
not
been
invaded
since
his
last
visit
there
he
turned
back
the
oilcloth
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
took
up
the
piece
of
loose
flooring
which
however
strangely
enough
fitted
so
closely
as
to
give
no
sign
of
its
existence
even
should
it
inadvertently
by
some
curious
visitor
again
be
trod
upon
and
from
the
aperture
beneath
lifted
out
a
bundle
of
clothes
and
a
small
box
undressed
now
he
carefully
folded
the
clothes
he
had
taken
off
laid
them
under
the
flooring
and
began
to
dress
again
his
wardrobe
supplied
by
the
bundle
he
had
taken
out
in
exchange
an
old
pair
of
shoes
the
laces
broken
mismated
socks
patched
trousers
frayed
at
the
bottoms
a
soiled
shirt
collarless
open
at
the
neck
attired
to
his
satisfaction
he
placed
the
box
upon
the
table
propped
up
a
cracked
mirror
sat
down
in
front
of
it
and
with
a
deft
artist
touch
began
to
apply
stain
to
his
hands
wrists
neck
throat
and
face
but
the
hardness
the
grim
menace
that
now
grew
into
the
dominant
characteristic
of
his
features
was
not
due
to
the
stain
alone
dear
philanthropic
crook
his
eyes
were
on
the
tocsin
letter
that
lay
before
him
he
read
on
for
once
even
to
jimmie
dale
keen
facile
mind
a
first
reading
had
failed
to
convey
the
full
significance
of
what
she
had
written
it
was
too
amazing
almost
beyond
belief
the
series
of
crimes
rampant
for
the
past
few
weeks
at
which
the
community
had
stood
aghast
the
brutal
murder
of
roessle
but
a
few
hours
old
lay
bare
before
his
eyes
it
was
all
there
all
of
it
the
details
the
hellish
cleverness
the
personnel
even
of
the
thugs
all
everything
except
the
proof
get
him
jimmie
the
man
higher
up
get
him
jimmie
before
another
pays
forfeit
with
his
life
the
words
seemed
to
leap
out
at
him
from
the
white
page
in
red
dancing
lines
get
him
jimmie
the
man
higher
jimmie
dale
finished
the
second
reading
of
the
letter
read
it
again
for
the
third
time
then
tore
it
into
tiny
fragments
his
fingers
delved
into
the
box
again
and
the
transformation
of
jimmie
dale
member
of
new
york
most
exclusive
social
set
into
a
low
denizen
of
the
underworld
went
on
a
little
wax
applied
skilfully
behind
the
ears
in
the
nostrils
and
under
the
upper
lip
it
was
all
there
all
except
the
proof
and
the
proof
he
laughed
aloud
suddenly
unpleasantly
there
seemed
something
sardonic
in
it
ay
more
than
that
all
that
was
grim
in
irony
the
proof
in
stangeist
own
writing
sworn
to
before
witnesses
in
the
presence
of
a
notary
the
text
of
the
document
of
course
unknown
to
both
witnesses
and
notary
evidence
absolute
and
final
that
would
be
admitted
in
any
court
for
stangeist
was
a
lawyer
and
would
see
to
that
was
in
stangeist
own
safe
for
stangeist
own
protection
stangeist
who
was
himself
the
head
and
brains
of
this
murder
gang
stangeist
who
was
the
man
higher
up
it
was
amazing
without
parallel
in
the
history
of
crime
and
yet
ingenious
clever
full
of
the
craft
and
cunning
that
had
built
up
the
shyster
lawyer
reputation
below
the
dead
line
jimmie
dale
lips
were
curiously
thin
now
so
it
was
stangeist
a
doctor
jekyll
and
hyde
with
a
vengeance
he
knew
stangeist
not
personally
not
by
the
reputation
stangeist
held
low
even
as
that
was
among
his
brother
members
of
the
profession
but
as
the
man
was
known
for
what
he
really
was
among
the
crooks
and
criminals
of
the
underworld
where
in
that
strange
underground
exchange
whispered
confidences
passed
between
those
whose
common
enemy
was
the
law
where
larry
the
bat
himself
was
trusted
in
the
innermost
circles
stangeist
was
a
power
in
the
bad
lands
there
were
few
among
that
unholy
community
that
stangeist
at
one
time
or
another
in
one
way
or
another
had
not
rescued
from
the
clutches
of
the
law
resorting
to
any
trick
or
cunning
but
with
perjury
that
he
could
handle
like
the
master
of
it
that
he
was
employed
as
the
most
common
weapon
of
defence
for
his
clients
provided
he
were
paid
well
enough
for
it
the
man
had
become
more
than
the
attorney
for
the
crime
world
he
had
become
part
of
it
cunning
shrewd
crafty
conscienceless
that
was
stangeist
the
form
and
features
of
the
man
pictured
themselves
in
jimmie
mind
the
muscular
frame
that
was
invariably
clothed
in
attire
of
the
most
fashionable
cut
the
thin
lips
with
their
oily
plausible
smile
the
straight
black
hair
that
straggled
into
pin
point
little
black
eyes
the
dark
face
with
its
high
cheek
bones
which
with
the
pronounced
aquiline
nose
and
the
persistent
rumour
that
he
was
a
quarter
caste
had
led
the
underworld
prejudiced
always
in
favour
of
a
monaker
to
dub
the
man
the
indian
jimmie
dale
laughed
again
still
unpleasantly
so
stangeist
had
taken
the
plunge
at
last
and
branched
out
into
a
wider
field
had
he
well
there
was
nothing
surprising
in
that
except
that
he
had
not
done
it
before
the
irony
of
it
lay
in
the
fact
that
at
last
he
had
been
too
clever
overstepped
himself
in
his
own
cleverness
that
was
all
it
was
australian
ike
the
mope
and
clarie
deane
that
stangeist
had
gathered
around
him
the
tocsin
had
said
and
there
were
none
worse
in
larry
the
bat
wide
range
of
acquaintanceship
than
those
three
stangeist
had
made
himself
master
of
australian
ike
the
mope
and
clarie
deane
and
he
had
driven
them
a
little
too
hard
on
the
division
of
the
spoils
and
laughed
at
them
and
cracked
the
whip
much
after
the
fashion
that
the
trainer
in
the
cage
handles
the
growling
beasts
around
him
a
dozen
of
the
crimes
that
had
appalled
and
staggered
new
york
they
had
committed
under
his
leadership
and
then
it
seemed
they
had
quarrelled
furiously
the
three
pitted
against
stangeist
threatening
him
demanding
a
more
equitable
share
of
the
proceeds
none
was
better
aware
than
stangeist
that
threats
from
men
of
their
calibre
were
likely
to
result
in
a
grim
aftermath
and
stangeist
yesterday
the
tocsin
said
had
answered
them
as
no
other
man
than
stangeist
would
either
have
thought
of
or
have
dared
to
do
one
by
one
at
separate
times
covering
the
other
with
a
revolver
stangeist
had
permitted
them
to
read
a
document
that
was
addressed
to
the
district
attorney
it
was
a
confession
complete
in
every
detail
of
every
crime
the
four
together
had
committed
implicating
stangeist
as
fully
and
unreservedly
as
it
did
the
other
three
it
required
no
commentary
if
anything
happened
to
stangeist
a
stab
in
the
dark
for
instance
a
bullet
from
some
dark
alleyway
a
blackjack
deftly
wielded
as
only
australian
ike
the
mope
or
clarie
deane
knew
how
to
wield
it
the
document
automatically
became
a
death
sentence
for
australian
ike
the
mope
and
clarie
deane
it
was
very
simple
and
evidently
it
had
been
effective
as
witness
the
renewal
of
their
operations
in
the
murder
of
roessle
that
afternoon
fear
and
avarice
had
both
probably
played
their
part
fear
of
the
man
who
would
with
such
consummate
nerve
fling
his
life
into
the
balance
to
turn
the
tables
upon
them
while
he
jeered
at
them
avarice
that
prompted
them
to
get
what
they
could
out
of
stangeist
brains
and
leadership
and
to
be
satisfied
with
what
they
could
get
since
they
could
get
no
more
satisfied
jimmie
dale
shook
his
head
no
that
was
hardly
the
word
cowed
perhaps
for
the
moment
would
be
better
but
afterward
with
a
document
like
that
in
existence
when
they
would
never
be
safe
for
an
instant
well
beasts
in
the
cages
had
been
known
to
get
the
better
of
the
man
with
the
whip
and
beasts
were
gentle
things
compared
with
australian
ike
the
mope
and
clarie
deane
some
day
they
would
reverse
the
tables
on
the
indian
chief
if
they
could
and
if
they
could
it
would
not
be
for
the
lack
of
trying
there
would
be
another
act
in
that
drama
of
the
house
divided
before
the
curtain
fell
and
there
would
be
a
sort
of
grim
poetic
justice
in
it
a
temptation
almost
to
let
the
play
work
itself
out
to
its
own
inevitable
conclusion
only
jimmie
dale
the
final
touches
given
to
his
features
stood
up
and
his
hands
clenched
suddenly
fiercely
it
was
not
just
the
man
higher
up
alone
there
were
the
other
three
as
well
the
whole
four
of
them
all
of
them
crimes
without
number
at
their
door
brutal
fiendish
acts
damnable
outrages
murder
to
answer
for
with
which
the
public
now
was
beginning
to
connect
the
name
of
the
gray
seal
the
gray
seal
jimmie
dale
hands
whose
delicate
fingers
were
artfully
grimed
and
blackened
now
beneath
the
nails
clenched
still
tighter
and
then
with
a
quick
shrug
of
his
shoulders
a
thinning
of
the
firmly
compressed
lips
he
picked
up
the
coat
from
where
it
lay
upon
the
floor
put
it
on
put
the
money
that
was
on
the
table
in
his
pocket
and
replaced
the
box
under
the
flooring
in
quick
succession
from
the
same
hiding
place
an
automatic
a
black
silk
mask
an
electric
flashlight
that
thin
metal
box
like
a
cigarette
case
and
a
half
dozen
little
tools
were
stowed
away
in
his
pockets
the
flooring
carefully
replaced
the
oilcloth
spread
back
again
and
then
pulling
a
slouch
hat
well
down
over
his
eyes
he
reached
up
to
turn
off
the
gas
for
an
instant
his
hand
held
there
while
his
eyes
sweeping
around
the
apartment
took
in
every
single
detail
about
him
in
that
same
alert
comprehensive
way
as
when
he
had
entered
then
the
room
was
in
darkness
and
the
gray
seal
as
larry
the
bat
a
shuffling
unkempt
creature
of
the
underworld
alias
jimmie
dale
the
lionised
of
clubs
the
matrimonial
target
of
exclusive
closed
the
door
of
the
sanctuary
behind
him
shuffled
down
the
stairs
shuffled
out
into
the
lane
and
shuffled
along
the
street
toward
the
bowery
a
policeman
on
the
corner
accosted
him
familiarly
hello
larry
grinned
the
officer
returned
jimmie
dale
affably
through
the
side
of
his
mouth
fine
night
ai
it
and
shuffled
on
along
the
street
and
now
jimmie
dale
began
to
hurry
still
with
that
shuffling
tread
but
covering
the
ground
nevertheless
with
amazing
celerity
he
had
lost
no
time
since
receiving
the
tocsin
letter
it
was
true
but
for
all
that
it
was
now
after
ten
stangeist
house
was
dark
that
evening
she
had
said
meaning
that
the
occupants
stangeist
as
well
as
whatever
servants
there
might
be
for
stangeist
had
no
family
were
out
the
servants
in
town
for
a
theatre
or
picture
show
probably
and
stangeist
himself
as
yet
not
back
presumably
from
that
roessle
affair
the
stub
of
an
old
cigar
unlighted
shifted
with
a
sudden
savage
twist
of
the
lips
from
one
side
of
jimmie
dale
mouth
to
the
other
there
was
need
for
haste
there
was
no
telling
when
stangeist
might
get
back
as
for
the
servants
that
did
not
matter
so
much
servants
in
suburban
homes
had
a
marked
affinity
for
last
trains
jimmie
dale
boarded
a
car
effected
a
transfer
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
leaving
the
sanctuary
was
huddled
an
inoffensive
heap
like
a
workingman
in
a
corner
seat
of
a
long
island
train
from
here
there
was
only
a
short
run
ahead
of
him
and
twenty
minutes
later
descending
from
the
train
at
forest
hills
he
had
passed
through
the
more
thickly
settled
portion
of
the
little
place
and
was
walking
briskly
out
along
the
country
road
stangeist
house
lay
approximately
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
station
quite
by
itself
and
set
well
back
from
the
road
jimmie
dale
could
have
found
it
with
his
eyes
blindfolded
the
tocsin
directions
had
lacked
none
of
their
usual
explicit
minuteness
the
road
was
quite
deserted
jimmie
dale
met
no
one
even
in
the
houses
that
he
passed
the
lights
were
in
nearly
every
instance
already
out
something
merciless
in
its
rage
swept
suddenly
over
jimmie
dale
as
unbidden
of
its
own
volition
the
last
paragraph
he
had
read
in
that
evening
paper
began
to
repeat
itself
over
and
over
again
in
his
mind
the
two
little
kiddies
it
seemed
as
though
he
could
see
them
standing
there
and
from
jimmie
dale
lips
not
given
to
profanity
there
came
a
bitter
oath
it
might
possibly
be
that
even
if
he
were
successful
in
what
was
before
him
the
authors
of
the
roessle
murder
would
never
be
known
that
confession
of
stangeist
was
written
prior
to
what
had
happened
that
afternoon
and
there
would
be
no
mention
naturally
of
roessle
and
for
a
moment
that
seemed
to
jimmie
dale
the
one
thing
paramount
to
all
others
the
one
thing
that
was
vital
then
he
shook
his
head
and
laughed
out
shortly
after
all
it
did
not
matter
whether
stangeist
and
the
blood
wolves
he
had
gathered
around
him
paid
the
penalty
specifically
for
one
particular
crime
or
for
another
could
make
little
difference
they
would
pay
just
as
surely
just
as
certainly
once
that
paper
was
in
his
possession
jimmie
dale
was
counting
the
houses
as
he
passed
they
were
more
infrequent
now
farther
apart
stangeist
was
no
fool
not
the
fool
that
he
would
appear
to
be
for
keeping
a
document
like
that
once
he
had
had
the
temerity
to
execute
it
in
his
own
safe
for
in
a
day
or
two
the
tocsin
had
hinted
at
this
after
holding
it
over
the
heads
of
australian
ike
the
mope
and
clarie
deane
again
to
drive
the
force
of
it
a
little
deeper
home
he
would
undoubtedly
destroy
it
and
the
supposition
that
it
was
still
in
existence
would
have
equally
the
same
effect
on
the
minds
of
the
other
three
stangeist
was
certainly
alive
to
the
peril
that
he
ran
with
such
a
thing
in
his
possession
only
the
peril
had
not
appealed
to
him
as
imminent
either
from
the
three
thugs
with
whom
he
had
allied
himself
or
much
less
from
any
one
else
that
was
all
jimmie
dale
halted
by
a
low
ornamental
stone
fence
some
three
feet
high
and
stood
there
for
a
moment
glancing
about
him
this
was
stangeist
house
he
could
just
make
out
the
building
as
it
loomed
up
a
shadowy
irregular
shape
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
back
from
the
fence
the
house
was
quite
dark
not
a
light
showed
in
any
window
jimmie
dale
sat
down
casually
on
the
fence
looked
carefully
again
up
and
down
the
road
then
swinging
his
legs
over
quick
now
in
every
action
he
dropped
to
the
other
side
and
stole
silently
across
the
grass
to
the
rear
of
the
house
here
he
stopped
again
reached
up
to
a
window
that
was
about
on
a
level
with
his
shoulders
and
tested
its
fastenings
the
window
it
was
the
window
of
stangeist
private
sanctum
according
to
the
plan
in
her
letter
was
securely
locked
jimmie
dale
hands
went
into
his
pocket
and
the
black
silk
mask
was
slipped
over
his
face
he
listened
intently
then
a
little
steel
instrument
began
to
gnaw
like
a
rat
a
minute
passed
two
of
them
again
jimmie
dale
listened
there
was
not
a
sound
save
the
night
sounds
the
light
breeze
whispering
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
the
rumble
of
a
train
the
whir
of
insects
the
hoarse
croaking
of
a
frog
from
some
creek
or
pond
the
window
sash
was
raised
an
inch
another
and
gradually
to
the
top
like
a
shadow
jimmie
dale
pulled
himself
up
to
the
sill
and
poised
there
his
hand
parted
the
heavy
portieres
that
hung
within
it
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
even
a
single
object
in
the
room
he
lowered
himself
to
the
floor
and
slipped
cautiously
between
the
portieres
from
somewhere
in
the
house
a
clock
began
to
strike
jimmie
dale
counted
the
strokes
eleven
it
was
getting
late
too
late
stangeist
was
likely
to
be
back
at
any
moment
the
flashlight
in
jimmie
dale
hand
now
circled
the
room
with
its
little
round
white
ray
lingering
an
instant
in
a
queer
inquisitive
sort
of
way
here
and
there
on
this
object
and
that
and
went
out
jimmie
dale
nodded
the
flat
desk
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
the
safe
in
the
corner
by
the
rear
wall
the
position
of
everything
in
the
room
even
to
the
chairs
was
photographed
on
his
mind
he
stepped
from
the
portieres
to
the
safe
and
the
flashlight
played
again
this
time
reflecting
back
from
the
glistening
nickelled
knobs
jimmie
dale
lips
tightened
it
was
a
small
safe
almost
ludicrously
small
but
to
such
height
as
the
art
of
safe
design
had
been
carried
that
design
was
embodied
in
the
one
before
him
type
muttered
jimmie
dale
a
nasty
little
beggar
and
it
eleven
now
i
use
for
once
if
it
were
that
it
would
put
stangeist
wise
and
give
him
a
chance
to
make
his
before
the
district
attorney
got
the
nippers
on
the
four
of
the
light
went
out
jimmie
dale
dropped
to
his
knees
and
while
his
left
hand
passed
swiftly
tentatively
over
dials
and
handle
he
rubbed
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
rapidly
to
and
fro
over
the
carpet
wonderful
finger
tips
were
those
of
jimmie
dale
sensitive
to
an
abnormal
degree
and
now
tingling
with
the
friction
the
nerves
throbbing
at
the
skin
surface
they
closed
in
a
light
delicate
touch
upon
the
knob
of
the
dial
and
jimmie
dale
ear
pressed
close
against
the
face
of
the
safe
time
passed
the
silence
grew
heavy
seemed
to
palpitate
through
the
room
then
a
deep
breath
half
like
a
sigh
half
like
a
fluttering
sob
as
of
a
strong
man
taxed
to
the
uttermost
of
his
endurance
came
from
jimmie
dale
and
his
left
hand
swept
away
the
sweat
beads
that
had
spurted
to
his
forehead
eight
thirteen
whispered
jimmie
dale
there
was
a
click
a
low
metallic
thud
as
the
bolts
slid
back
and
the
door
swung
open
and
now
the
flashlight
again
searching
the
mechanism
of
the
inner
door
then
darkness
once
more
five
minutes
ten
minutes
went
by
the
clock
struck
again
and
the
single
stroke
seemed
to
boom
out
through
the
house
in
a
weird
raucous
threatening
note
and
seemed
to
linger
throbbing
in
the
air
the
inner
door
was
open
the
flashlight
ray
was
flooding
a
nest
of
pigeonholes
and
little
drawers
the
pigeonholes
were
crammed
with
papers
as
presumably
too
were
the
drawers
jimmie
dale
sucked
in
his
breath
he
had
already
been
there
well
over
half
an
hour
every
minute
now
every
second
was
counting
against
him
and
to
search
that
mass
of
papers
before
stangeist
returned
was
ah
it
came
in
a
fierce
little
ejaculation
from
jimmie
dale
from
the
centre
pigeonhole
almost
the
first
paper
he
had
touched
he
drew
a
long
sealed
envelope
and
at
a
single
swift
glance
had
read
the
inscription
upon
it
written
in
longhand
to
the
district
attorney
new
york
city
important
urgent
the
words
in
the
corners
were
underscored
three
times
swiftly
deftly
jimmie
dale
hands
rolled
the
rounded
end
of
one
of
his
collection
of
the
legal
instruments
under
the
flap
of
the
envelope
turned
the
sheets
over
and
drew
out
the
folded
document
inside
there
were
eight
sheets
of
legal
foolscap
neatly
fastened
together
at
the
top
corner
with
green
tape
he
opened
them
out
read
a
few
words
here
and
there
and
turned
the
pages
hurriedly
over
to
scrutinise
the
last
one
and
nodded
grimly
three
witnesses
had
testified
to
the
signature
of
stangeist
and
a
notary
seal
accompanied
by
the
usual
legal
formula
was
duly
affixed
jimmie
dale
slipped
the
document
into
his
pocket
and
with
the
envelope
in
his
hand
moved
to
the
desk
he
opened
first
one
drawer
and
then
another
and
finally
discovering
a
pile
of
blank
foolscap
took
out
four
sheets
folded
them
and
placed
them
in
the
envelope
sealing
the
flap
of
the
latter
again
that
it
did
not
seal
very
well
now
brought
a
quizzical
twitch
to
jimmie
dale
lips
sealed
or
unsealed
perhaps
it
made
little
difference
but
for
all
that
he
was
not
through
with
it
yet
apart
from
bringing
the
four
to
justice
there
was
after
all
a
chance
to
vindicate
the
gray
seal
in
this
matter
at
least
and
repudiate
the
newspaper
theory
which
the
public
to
whom
the
gray
seal
was
already
a
monster
of
iniquity
would
seize
upon
with
avidity
there
was
no
further
need
of
light
now
jimmie
dale
replaced
the
flashlight
in
his
pocket
took
out
the
thin
metal
case
opened
it
and
with
the
tiny
pair
of
tweezers
that
likewise
nestled
there
lifted
out
one
of
the
gray
paper
seals
there
was
no
question
but
that
once
under
arrest
stangeist
effects
would
be
immediately
and
thoroughly
searched
by
the
authorities
jimmie
dale
smile
from
quizzical
became
ironic
it
would
afford
the
police
another
little
bewildering
reminder
of
the
gray
seal
and
give
carruthers
good
old
carruthers
of
the
morning
so
innocently
ignorant
that
the
gray
seal
was
his
old
college
pal
yet
the
one
editor
of
them
all
who
was
not
forever
barking
and
yelping
at
the
gray
seal
heels
a
chance
to
vindicate
himself
a
little
too
jimmie
dale
moistened
the
adhesive
side
of
the
gray
seal
and
still
mindful
of
finger
prints
laid
it
with
the
tweezers
on
the
flap
of
the
envelope
and
pressed
it
firmly
into
place
with
his
elbow
and
then
suddenly
every
faculty
instantly
on
the
alert
he
snatched
up
the
envelope
from
the
desk
and
listened
was
it
imagination
a
trick
of
nerves
or
no
there
it
was
again
a
footfall
on
the
gravel
walk
at
the
front
of
the
house
the
sound
became
louder
clearer
two
footfalls
instead
of
one
it
was
stangeist
and
somebody
was
with
him
in
an
instant
jimmie
dale
was
across
the
room
and
kneeling
again
before
the
safe
his
fingers
were
flying
now
the
envelope
shot
back
into
the
pigeonhole
from
which
he
had
taken
it
the
inner
door
of
the
safe
closed
silently
and
swiftly
a
dry
chuckle
came
from
jimmie
dale
lips
it
was
just
like
fiction
just
precisely
time
enough
to
have
accomplished
what
he
had
come
for
before
he
was
interrupted
not
a
second
more
or
less
the
villain
foiled
at
the
psychological
moment
the
key
was
rattling
in
the
front
door
now
they
were
in
the
hall
he
could
hear
stangeist
voice
there
came
a
dull
glow
from
the
hallway
following
the
click
of
an
switch
the
outer
door
of
the
safe
swung
shut
the
bolts
slid
into
place
the
dial
whirled
under
jimmie
dale
fingers
it
was
only
a
step
to
the
portieres
the
open
window
and
escape
he
straightened
up
stepped
back
the
portieres
closed
behind
him
and
the
chuckle
died
on
jimmie
dale
lips
he
was
trapped
caught
without
so
much
as
a
corner
in
which
to
turn
stangeist
was
even
then
coming
into
the
room
and
outside
darkly
outlined
two
forms
stood
just
beneath
the
window
instinctively
quick
as
a
flash
jimmie
dale
crouched
below
the
sill
who
were
they
what
did
it
mean
questions
swept
in
swift
sequence
through
his
brain
had
they
seen
him
it
would
be
very
dark
against
the
background
of
the
portieres
but
yet
if
they
were
watching
he
drew
a
breath
of
relief
he
had
not
been
seen
their
voices
reached
him
in
low
guarded
whispers
say
youse
ike
pipe
it
dere
a
window
open
in
the
snitch
room
come
on
we
get
in
dere
it
make
the
hair
stand
up
on
the
back
of
his
neck
fer
a
aw
ferget
it
replied
another
voice
can
the
stunt
clarie
leaves
the
front
door
unfastened
do
he
an
dey
be
in
dere
in
a
minute
now
wotcher
want
ter
do
crab
the
game
he
might
hear
us
an
fix
clarie
before
we
had
a
chanst
the
skinny
old
fox
an
the
light
now
see
beat
it
on
yer
toes
fer
the
front
of
the
house
the
room
was
flooded
with
light
through
the
portieres
that
jimmie
dale
parted
by
the
barest
fraction
of
an
inch
he
could
see
stangeist
and
another
man
a
customer
clarie
deane
according
to
that
brief
whispered
colloquy
that
he
had
heard
outside
he
looked
again
through
the
window
the
two
dark
forms
had
disappeared
now
but
they
had
disappeared
just
a
few
seconds
too
late
with
the
two
other
men
now
in
the
room
and
one
of
them
so
close
that
jimmie
dale
could
almost
have
reached
out
and
touched
him
it
was
impossible
to
get
through
the
window
without
being
detected
when
the
slightest
sound
would
attract
instant
attention
and
equally
instant
suspicion
it
was
a
chance
to
be
taken
only
as
a
last
resort
jimmie
dale
face
grew
hard
as
his
fingers
closed
around
his
automatic
and
drew
the
weapon
from
his
pocket
it
was
all
plain
enough
that
last
act
in
the
drama
which
he
had
speculatively
anticipated
was
being
staged
with
little
loss
of
time
and
in
a
grim
sort
of
way
the
thought
flashed
across
his
mind
that
perilous
as
his
own
position
was
stangeist
at
that
moment
was
in
even
greater
peril
than
himself
australian
ike
the
mope
and
clarie
deane
given
the
chance
and
they
seemed
to
have
made
that
chance
now
were
not
likely
to
deal
in
half
measures
clarie
deane
had
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
the
desk
and
the
mope
and
australian
ike
were
creeping
around
to
the
front
door
the
parting
in
the
portieres
widened
a
little
more
a
very
little
more
slowly
imperceptibly
until
jimmie
dale
by
the
simple
expedient
of
moving
his
head
could
obtain
an
unobstructed
view
of
the
entire
room
stangeist
tossed
a
bag
he
had
been
carrying
on
the
desk
pulled
up
a
chair
opposite
to
clarie
deane
and
sat
down
both
men
were
side
face
to
jimmie
dale
you
tell
the
boys
said
stangeist
abruptly
to
fade
away
after
this
for
a
while
things
are
getting
too
hot
and
you
tell
the
mope
i
dock
him
five
hundred
for
that
extra
crunch
on
roessle
skull
that
sort
of
thing
is
necessary
that
the
kind
of
stunt
that
gets
the
public
sore
the
man
was
dead
enough
as
it
was
see
sure
clarie
deane
ejaculation
was
a
grunt
stangeist
opened
the
bag
and
dumped
the
contents
on
the
desk
pile
after
pile
of
banknotes
the
pay
roll
of
the
mills
some
haul
observed
clarie
deane
with
a
hoarse
chuckle
the
papers
said
over
twenty
you
ca
always
believe
what
the
papers
say
returned
stangeist
curtly
and
taking
a
scribbling
pad
from
the
desk
began
to
check
up
the
packages
clarie
deane
cigar
had
gone
out
he
rolled
the
short
stub
in
his
mouth
and
leaned
forward
the
bills
were
evidently
just
as
they
had
been
delivered
to
the
murdered
paymaster
at
the
bank
done
up
with
little
narrow
paper
bands
in
packages
of
one
hundred
notes
each
save
for
a
small
bundle
of
loose
bills
which
latter
with
the
rolls
of
silver
stangeist
swept
to
one
side
of
the
desk
package
by
package
stangeist
went
on
jotting
the
amounts
down
on
the
pad
nix
growled
clarie
deane
suddenly
cut
that
out
them
fivers
in
that
wad
make
that
five
hundred
instead
of
one
i
onter
yer
mistake
said
stangeist
suavely
changing
the
figures
with
his
pencil
you
pretty
wide
awake
for
this
time
of
night
are
you
clarie
oh
i
dunno
responded
clarie
deane
gruffly
not
so
very
stangeist
finished
with
the
packages
picked
up
the
loose
bills
and
with
a
short
laugh
tossed
them
into
the
bag
and
followed
them
with
the
rolls
of
silver
he
pushed
the
bag
toward
clarie
deane
that
a
little
extra
for
you
he
said
the
trouble
with
you
fellows
is
that
you
do
know
when
you
well
off
but
the
sooner
you
find
it
out
the
better
unless
you
want
another
lesson
like
he
made
the
addition
on
the
pad
fifteen
thousand
eight
hundred
dollars
he
announced
softly
that
seven
thousand
nine
hundred
for
the
three
of
you
to
divide
less
five
hundred
from
the
clarie
deane
eyes
narrowed
his
hands
were
on
his
knees
hidden
by
the
desk
there
twenty
there
he
said
sullenly
and
drew
a
match
across
the
under
edge
of
the
desk
with
a
long
crackling
noise
stangeist
face
lost
its
suavity
a
snarl
curled
his
lips
but
about
to
reply
he
sprang
suddenly
to
his
feet
instead
his
head
turned
sharply
toward
the
door
what
that
he
said
hoarsely
it
not
the
servants
they
dare
to
stangeist
words
ended
in
a
gulp
he
was
staring
into
the
muzzle
of
a
revolver
that
clarie
deane
had
jerked
up
from
under
the
desk
you
sit
down
or
i
blow
your
block
off
said
clarie
deane
with
a
sudden
leer
it
happened
then
almost
before
jimmie
dale
could
grasp
the
details
before
even
clarie
deane
himself
could
interfere
the
door
burst
open
two
men
rushed
in
and
one
with
a
bound
flung
himself
at
stangeist
the
man
hand
grasping
a
clubbed
revolver
rose
in
the
air
descended
on
stangeist
head
and
stangeist
went
down
in
a
limp
heap
crashed
into
the
chair
and
slid
from
the
chair
with
a
thud
to
the
floor
there
was
an
oath
from
clarie
deane
he
jumped
from
his
seat
and
with
a
violent
shove
sent
the
man
reeling
half
across
the
room
blast
you
mope
he
snarled
you
too
blamed
fly
d
wanter
queer
the
whole
biz
aw
wot
the
matter
wid
youse
the
mope
with
rage
little
black
eyes
glittering
mouth
working
under
a
flattened
nose
that
some
previous
encounter
had
broken
and
bent
over
the
side
of
his
face
advanced
belligerently
australian
ike
who
had
entered
the
room
with
him
pulled
him
back
ferget
it
he
flung
out
clarie
dealin
the
deck
ferget
it
the
mope
glared
from
one
to
the
other
then
shook
his
fist
at
stangeist
on
the
floor
youse
two
make
me
sick
he
sneered
wot

use
of
waitin
all

to
bump
him
off
anyway
was
we
dat
wot
youse
said
yerselves
wot

ter
stop

writin
out

paper
if

rejoined
clarie
deane
but
that

second
act

paper
yet
have
we
say
take
a
look
at
that
safe
it
easier
ter
scare
him
inter
openin
it
than
ter
crack
it
ai
it
jimmie
dale
from
his
crouched
position
began
to
rise
to
his
feet
slowly
making
but
the
slightest
movement
at
a
time
cautious
of
the
least
sound
his
lips
were
like
a
thin
line
his
fingers
tightly
pressed
over
the
automatic
in
his
hand
there
was
not
room
for
him
between
the
portieres
and
the
window
and
do
what
he
could
the
hangings
bulged
a
little
let
one
of
the
three
notice
that
or
inadvertently
brush
against
the
portieres
and
his
life
would
not
be
worth
an
instant
purchase
they
were
lifting
stangeist
up
now
propping
him
up
in
the
chair
stangeist
moaned
opened
his
eyes
stared
in
a
dazed
way
at
the
three
faces
that
leered
into
his
then
dawning
intelligence
came
and
his
face
that
had
been
white
before
took
on
a
pasty
grayish
pallor
you
the
three
of
you
he
mumbled
what
this
mean
and
then
clarie
deane
laughed
in
a
low
brutal
way

stangeist
closed
his
eyes
when
he
opened
them
again
something
of
the
craftiness
was
in
his
face
well
what
are
you
going
to

he
inquired
almost
sharply

repeated
clarie
deane
there
half
of
that
minute
jimmie
dale
eyes
in
a
fascinated
sort
of
way
were
on
stangeist
the
man
face
was
twitching
now
moisture
began
to
ooze
from
his
forehead
as
the
callous
brutality
of
the
scowling
faces
seemed
to
get
him
and
then
he
lurched
suddenly
forward
in
his
chair
my
god
he
cried
out
a
ring
of
terror
in
his
voice
what
do
you
mean
to
do
you
pay
for
it
they
get
you
the
servants

his
lips
with
his
tongue
suppose

said
hoarsely

said
clarie

with
a
vicious
grin

here
see
you
can
take
yer
choice
either

he
paused
and
produced
a
small
bottle
from
his
pocket
this
is
an
we
opens
it
fer
you
with
this
only
if
we

if

a
good
guesser
you
can
guess
the
there
was
a
short
raucous
guffaw
from
the
mope
stangeist
turned
a
drawn
face
toward
the
man
stared
at
him
and
stared
in
a
miserable
way
at
the
other
two
in
turn
he
licked
his
lips
again
none
was
in
a
better
position
than
himself
to
know
that
there
would
be
neither
scruples
nor
hesitancy
to
interfere
with
carrying
out
the
threat
suppose
he
said
trying
to
keep
his
voice
steady
suppose
i
open
the
safe
what
then
afterward
we
ai
got
the
safe
open
yet
countered
clarie
deane
uncompromisingly
an
we
ai
got
no
more
time
ter
fool
over
it
either
you
get
a
move
on
before
i
counts
five
or
the
mope
an
ike
ties
you
up
one
stangeist
staggered
to
his
feet
wiped
the
blood
out
of
his
eyes
for
the
second
time
and
with
lips
working
went
unsteadily
across
the
room
to
the
safe
he
knelt
before
it
and
began
to
manipulate
the
dial
while
the
others
crowded
around
behind
him
the
mope
was
fingering
his
revolver
again
club
fashion
australian
ike
elbow
just
grazed
the
portieres
and
jimmie
dale
flattened
himself
against
the
window
holding
his
breath
a
smile
on
his
lips
that
was
mirthless
deadly
cold
the
end
was
not
far
off
now
and
then
what
stangeist
had
the
outer
door
of
the
safe
open
now
and
now
the
inner
door
swung
back
he
reached
in
his
hand
to
the
pigeonhole
drew
out
the
envelope
and
with
a
sudden
wild
cry
reeled
to
his
feet
my
god
he
screamed
out
what
what
this
clarie
deane
snatched
the
envelope
from
him
the
gray
seal
the
words
came
with
a
jerk
from
his
lips
he
ripped
the
envelope
open
frantically
and
like
a
man
stunned
gazed
at
the
four
blank
sheets
while
the
colour
left
his
face
it
gone
he
cried
out
hoarsely
gone
there
was
a
burst
of
oaths
from
australian
ike
gone
den
nipped
de
lot
of
us
the
mope
face
was
like
a
maniac
as
he
whirled
on
stangeist
sure
he
croaked
but
youse
gets
yers
first
youse
with
a
cry
stangeist
to
elude
the
blow
ducked
blindly
backward
into
the
portieres
and
with
a
rip
and
tear
the
hangings
were
wrenched
apart
it
came
instantaneously
a
yell
of
mingled
surprise
and
fury
from
the
three
the
crash
and
spit
of
jimmie
dale
revolver
as
he
fired
one
shot
at
the
floor
to
stop
their
rush
then
he
flung
himself
at
the
window
through
it
and
dropped
sprawling
to
the
ground
a
stream
of
flame
cut
the
darkness
above
him
a
bullet
whistled
by
his
head
another
and
another
he
was
on
his
feet
quick
as
a
cat
and
running
close
alongside
of
the
wall
of
the
house
he
heard
a
thud
behind
him
still
another
and
yet
a
third
they
were
dropping
through
the
window
after
him
came
another
shot
an
angry
hum
of
the
bullet
closer
than
before
then
the
pound
of
racing
feet
jimmie
dale
swung
around
the
corner
of
the
house
running
at
top
speed
something
that
was
like
a
hot
iron
suddenly
burned
and
seared
along
the
side
of
his
head
just
above
the
ear
he
reeled
staggered
recovered
himself
and
dashed
on
it
nauseated
him
that
stinging
in
his
head
and
all
at
once
seemed
to
be
draining
his
strength
away
the
shouts
the
shots
the
running
feet
became
like
a
curious
buzzing
in
his
ears
it
seemed
strange
that
they
should
have
hit
him
that
he
should
be
wounded
if
he
could
only
reach
the
low
stone
wall
by
the
road
he
could
at
least
make
a
fight
for
his
life
on
the
other
side
red
streaks
swam
before
jimmie
dale
eyes
the
wall
was
such
a
long
way
off
a
yard
or
two
was
a
very
long
way
more
to
go
the
weakness
seemed
to
be
creeping
up
now
even
to
numb
his
brain
no
here
was
the
wall
they
had
hit
him
again
he
laughed
in
a
demented
way
and
rolled
his
body
over
and
fell
to
the
other
side
jimmie
the
cry
seemed
to
reach
some
inner
consciousness
revive
him
send
the
blood
whipping
through
his
veins
that
voice
it
was
her
hers
the
tocsin
there
was
an
automobile
engine
racing
standing
there
in
the
road
he
won
to
his
feet
dark
rushing
forms
were
almost
at
the
wall
he
fired
once
twice
fired
again
and
turned
staggering
for
the
car
jimmie
jimmie
quick
panting
gasping
he
half
fell
into
the
tonneau
the
car
leaped
forward
yells
filled
the
air
but
only
one
thing
was
dominant
in
jimmie
reeling
brain
now
he
pulled
himself
up
to
his
feet
and
leaned
over
the
back
of
the
seat
reaching
for
the
slim
figure
that
was
bent
over
the
wheel
it
you
you
at
last
he
cried
your
face
let
me
lee
your
face
a
bullet
split
the
back
panel
of
the
car
little
spurting
flames
were
dancing
out
from
the
roadway
behind
are
you
mad
she
shouted
back
at
him
let
me
steer
do
you
want
them
to
hit
me
said
jimmie
dale
in
a
queer
singsong
sort
of
way
and
his
head
seemed
to
spin
dizzily
around
no
i
guess
he
choked
the
paper
it
in
my
pocket
and
he
went
down
unconscious
on
the
floor
of
the
car
when
he
recovered
his
senses
he
was
lying
on
a
couch
in
a
plainly
furnished
room
and
a
man
a
stranger
red
farmerish
looking
was
bending
over
him
where
am
i
he
demanded
finally
propping
himself
up
on
his
elbow
you
all
right
replied
the
man
she
said
you
come
around
in
a
little
who
said
so
inquired
jimmie
dale
she
did
the
woman
who
brought
you
here
about
five
minutes
ago
she
said
she
ran
you
down
with
her
oh
said
jimmie
dale
he
felt
his
head
it
was
bandaged
and
it
was
bandaged
he
was
quite
sure
with
a
piece
of
torn
underskirt
he
looked
at
the
man
again
you
have
told
me
yet
where
i
long
island
the
other
answered
my
name
hanson
i
keep
a
bit
of
a
truck
garden
oh
said
jimmie
dale
again
the
man
crossed
the
room
picked
up
an
envelope
from
the
table
and
came
back
to
jimmie
dale
she
said
to
give
you
this
as
soon
as
you
got
your
senses
and
asked
us
to
put
you
up
for
a
while
as
long
as
you
wanted
to
stay
and
paid
us
for
it
too
she
all
right
she
is
you
do
want
to
hold
the
accident
up
against
her
she
was
mighty
sorry
about
it
and
now
i
go
and
see
if
the
old
lady
got
your
room
ready
while
you
readin
your
the
man
left
the
room
jimmie
dale
sat
up
on
the
couch
and
tore
the
envelope
open
the
note
scrawled
in
pencil
began
abruptly
you
were
quite
a
problem
i
could
take
you
home
could
i
i
take
you
to
what
you
call
the
sanctuary
could
i
i
could
take
you
to
a
hospital
nor
call
in
a
doctor
the
stain
you
use
would
stand
it
but
thank
god
i
know
it
only
a
flesh
wound
and
you
are
all
right
where
you
are
for
the
day
or
two
that
you
must
keep
quiet
and
take
care
of
yourself
by
the
time
you
read
this
the
paper
will
be
on
the
way
to
the
proper
hands
and
by
morning
the
four
where
they
should
be
there
were
a
few
articles
in
your
clothes
i
thought
it
better
to
take
charge
of
in
case
well
in
case
of
jimmie
dale
tore
the
note
up
and
smiled
wryly
at
the
door
he
felt
in
his
pockets
mask
revolver
burglar
tools
and
the
thin
metal
insignia
case
were
gone
and
i
had
the
sublime
optimism
murmured
jimmie
dale
to
spend
months
trying
to
find
her
as
larry
the
bat
chapter
ix
two
crooks
and
a
knave
the
bullet
wound
along
the
side
of
his
head
and
just
above
his
ear
would
have
been
a
very
awkward
thing
indeed
in
more
ways
than
one
for
jimmie
dale
the
millionaire
to
have
explained
at
his
club
in
his
social
set
or
even
to
his
servants
and
of
these
latter
to
jason
the
solicitous
in
particular
but
for
jimmie
dale
as
larry
the
bat
it
was
a
matter
of
little
moment
there
was
none
to
question
larry
the
bat
save
in
a
most
casual
and
indifferent
way
and
a
bandage
of
any
description
primarily
and
above
all
one
that
he
could
arrange
himself
with
only
himself
to
take
note
of
the
incongruous
hues
of
skin
where
the
stain
the
grease
paint
and
the
was
washed
off
would
excite
little
attention
in
that
world
where
daily
affrays
were
happenings
and
a
wound
for
whatever
reason
had
long
since
lost
the
tang
of
novelty
why
then
should
it
arouse
even
a
passing
interest
if
larry
the
bat
credited
as
the
most
confirmed
of
dope
fiends
should
have
fallen
down
the
dark
rickety
stairs
of
the
tenement
in
one
of
his
orgies
and
in
the
expressive
language
of
the
bad
lands
cracked
his
bean
and
so
jimmie
dale
had
been
forced
to
maintain
the
role
of
larry
the
bat
for
a
far
longer
period
than
he
had
anticipated
when
ten
days
before
he
had
assumed
it
for
the
night
work
that
had
so
nearly
resulted
fatally
for
himself
though
it
had
placed
roessle
murderers
behind
the
bars
for
the
next
day
unwilling
to
court
the
risk
of
remaining
in
that
neighbourhood
he
had
left
hanson
the
farmer
house
on
long
island
where
the
tocsin
had
carried
him
in
an
unconscious
state
telephoned
jason
that
he
had
been
unexpectedly
called
out
of
town
for
a
few
days
and
returned
to
the
sanctuary
in
new
york
and
here
to
his
grim
dismay
he
had
found
the
underworld
in
a
state
of
furious
angry
unrest
like
a
nest
of
hornets
stirred
up
seeking
to
wreak
vengeance
on
an
unseen
assailant
for
years
as
the
gray
seal
jimmie
dale
had
lived
with
the
slogan
of
the
police
the
gray
seal
dead
or
alive
but
the
gray
seal
sounding
in
his
ears
with
the
newspapers
screaming
their
diatribes
arousing
the
people
against
him
nagging
the
authorities
into
sleepless
frenzied
efforts
to
trap
him
with
a
price
upon
his
head
that
was
large
enough
to
make
a
man
not
too
pretentious
rich
for
life
but
in
the
underworld
until
then
the
name
of
the
gray
seal
had
been
one
to
conjure
with
for
the
underworld
had
sworn
by
the
unknown
master
criminal
and
had
spoken
his
name
with
a
reverence
that
was
none
the
less
genuine
even
if
pungently
tainted
with
unholiness
but
now
it
was
different
up
and
down
through
the
bad
lands
in
gambling
hells
in
vicious
resorts
in
the
hiding
places
where
thugs
and
crooks
burrowed
themselves
away
from
the
daylight
through
the
heart
and
the
outskirts
of
the
underworld
travelled
the
fiat
whispered
out
of
mouths
crooked
to
one
side
death
to
the
gray
seal
gangland
differences
were
forgotten
in
the
larger
issue
of
the
common
weal
the
gang
spirit
became
the
spirit
of
a
united
whole
and
the
crime
fraternity
buzzed
and
hummed
poisonously
spurred
on
by
hatred
thirst
for
revenge
fear
and
perhaps
most
potent
of
all
a
hideous
suspicion
now
of
each
other
the
underworld
had
received
a
shock
at
which
it
stood
aghast
and
which
with
its
terrifying
possibilities
struck
consternation
into
the
soul
of
every
individual
of
that
brotherhood
whose
bond
was
crime
who
was
already
wanted
for
some
offence
or
other
whether
it
ranged
from
murder
in
the
first
degree
to
some
petty
piece
of
sneak
thievery
stangeist
the
indian
chief
the
lawyer
whose
cunning
brain
had
stood
as
a
rampart
between
the
underworld
and
a
prison
cell
was
himself
now
in
the
tombs
with
the
certainty
of
the
electric
chair
before
him
and
with
him
the
same
fate
equally
assured
were
australian
ike
the
mope
and
clarie
deane
aristocrats
of
the
bad
lands
peers
of
that
inglorious
realm
were
those
four
and
the
blow
had
fallen
with
stunning
force
a
blow
that
in
itself
would
have
been
enough
to
have
stirred
the
underworld
to
its
depths
but
that
was
not
all
from
the
cells
in
the
tombs
from
the
four
came
the
word
and
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
in
that
strange
underground
exchange
until
all
had
heard
it
that
the
gray
seal
had
the
gray
seal
who
though
unknown
they
had
counted
the
most
eminent
among
themselves
had
squealed
who
was
the
gray
seal
it
he
had
held
the
secrets
of
stangeist
and
his
band
what
else
might
he
not
know
who
else
might
not
fall
next
the
gray
seal
had
become
a
snitch
a
menace
a
source
of
danger
that
stalked
among
them
like
a
ghastly
spectre
who
was
the
gray
seal
none
knew
death
to
the
gray
seal
run
him
to
earth
went
the
whisper
from
lip
to
lip
and
with
the
whisper
men
stared
uncertainly
into
each
faces
fearful
that
the
one
to
whom
they
spoke
might
even
be
the
gray
seal
jimmie
dale
lips
twisted
queerly
as
he
looked
around
him
at
the
squalid
appointments
of
the
sanctuary
the
police
were
bad
enough
the
papers
were
worse
but
this
was
a
still
graver
peril
with
every
denizen
of
the
underworld
below
the
dead
line
suspicious
of
each
other
their
lives
the
penitentiary
or
a
prison
sentence
the
stakes
against
which
each
one
played
the
role
of
larry
the
bat
clever
as
was
the
and
disguise
was
fraught
now
more
than
ever
before
with
danger
and
peril
it
seemed
as
though
slowly
the
net
was
beginning
at
last
to
tighten
around
him
the
murky
yellow
flame
of
the
gas
jet
flickered
suddenly
as
though
in
acquiescence
with
the
quick
impulsive
shrug
of
jimmie
shoulders
and
jimmie
dale
bending
to
peer
into
the
cracked
mirror
that
was
propped
up
on
the
table
knotted
his
dress
tie
almost
fastidiously
the
hair
if
just
a
trifle
too
long
covered
the
scar
on
his
head
now
the
wound
no
longer
required
a
bandage
and
larry
the
bat
for
the
time
being
at
least
had
disappeared
across
the
foot
of
the
bed
neatly
folded
lay
his
dress
coat
and
overcoat
but
little
creased
for
all
that
they
had
lain
in
that
under
the
flooring
since
the
night
when
hurrying
from
the
club
he
had
placed
them
there
to
assume
instead
the
tatters
of
larry
the
bat
it
was
jimmie
dale
in
his
own
person
again
who
stood
there
now
in
larry
the
bat
disreputable
den
an
incongruous
figure
enough
against
the
background
of
his
miserable
surroundings
in
shoes
and
trousers
the
broad
expanse
of
spotless
white
shirt
bosom
glistening
even
in
the
flare
from
the
single
sputtering
gas
jet
jimmie
dale
took
the
watch
from
his
pocket
that
had
not
been
wound
for
many
days
wound
it
mechanically
set
it
by
guesswork
it
was
not
far
from
eight
and
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
carefully
then
one
at
a
time
he
examined
his
fingers
long
slim
sensitive
tapering
fingers
magical
masters
of
safes
and
locks
and
vaults
of
the
most
intricate
and
modern
mechanism
no
single
trace
of
grime
remained
they
were
metamorphosed
hands
from
the
filthy
paws
of
larry
the
bat
he
nodded
in
satisfaction
and
picked
up
the
mirror
for
a
final
inspection
of
himself
that
this
time
did
not
miss
a
single
line
in
his
face
or
neck
again
jimmie
dale
nodded
as
though
he
had
vanished
into
thin
air
as
though
he
had
never
existed
not
a
trace
of
larry
the
bat
remained
except
the
heap
of
rags
upon
the
floor
the
battered
slouch
hat
the
frayed
trousers
the
patched
boots
with
their
broken
laces
the
mismated
socks
the
grimy
flannel
shirt
and
the
old
coat
that
he
had
just
discarded
the
mirror
was
replaced
on
the
table
and
pushing
the
heap
of
clothes
before
him
with
his
foot
jimmie
dale
knelt
down
in
the
corner
of
the
room
where
the
oilcloth
had
been
turned
up
and
the
loose
planking
of
the
floor
removed
and
began
to
pack
the
articles
away
in
the
hole
jimmie
dale
rolled
the
trousers
of
larry
the
bat
into
a
compact
little
bundle
and
stuffed
them
under
the
flooring
the
gas
jet
seemed
to
blink
again
in
a
sort
of
confidential
approval
as
though
the
secret
lay
inviolate
between
itself
and
jimmie
dale
through
the
closed
window
shade
tightly
drawn
came
low
and
muffled
the
sound
of
distant
life
from
the
bowery
a
few
blocks
away
the
gas
jet
suffering
from
air
somewhere
within
the
pipes
hissed
angrily
the
yellow
flame
died
to
a
little
blue
forked
spurt
and
jimmie
dale
was
on
his
feet
his
face
suddenly
hard
and
white
as
marble
some
one
was
knocking
at
the
door
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
jimmie
dale
stood
motionless
found
as
jimmie
dale
in
the
den
of
larry
the
bat
and
the
consequences
required
no
effort
of
the
imagination
to
picture
them
police
or
denizen
of
the
underworld
who
was
knocking
there
it
was
all
the
same
the
method
of
death
would
be
a
little
different
that
was
all
one
legalised
the
other
not
jimmie
dale
larry
the
bat
the
gray
seal
once
uncovered
could
expect
as
much
quarter
as
would
be
given
to
a
cornered
rat
his
eyes
swept
the
room
with
a
swift
critical
glance
evidences
of
larry
the
bat
the
clothes
were
still
about
even
if
he
in
the
person
of
jimmie
dale
alone
damning
enough
were
not
standing
there
himself
and
he
was
even
weaponless
the
tocsin
had
taken
the
revolver
from
his
pocket
together
with
those
other
telltale
articles
the
mask
the
flashlight
the
little
tools
before
she
had
intrusted
him
that
night
wounded
and
unconscious
to
hanson
care
jimmie
dale
slipped
his
feet
out
of
his
low
evening
pumps
snatched
up
the
old
coat
and
hat
from
the
pile
put
them
on
and
without
a
sound
reached
the
gas
jet
and
turned
it
off
a
second
had
gone
by
no
more
the
knocking
still
sounded
insistently
on
the
door
it
was
dark
now
perfectly
black
he
started
across
the
room
his
tread
absolutely
silent
as
the
trained
muscles
relaxing
threw
the
body
weight
gradually
upon
one
foot
before
the
next
step
was
taken
it
was
like
a
shadow
a
little
blacker
in
outline
than
the
surrounding
blackness
stealing
across
the
floor
halfway
to
the
door
he
paused
the
knocking
had
ceased
he
listened
intently
it
was
not
repeated
instead
his
ear
caught
a
guarded
step
retreating
outside
in
the
hall
jimmie
dale
drew
a
breath
of
relief
he
went
on
again
to
the
door
still
listening
was
it
a
trap
that
step
outside
at
the
door
now
tense
alert
he
lowered
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
there
came
the
faintest
creak
from
the
stairs
jimmie
dale
brows
gathered
it
was
strange
the
knocking
had
not
lasted
long
whoever
it
was
was
going
away
but
it
required
the
utmost
caution
to
descend
those
stairs
rickety
and
as
they
were
with
no
more
sound
than
that
why
such
caution
why
not
a
more
determined
and
prolonged
effort
at
his
door
the
visitor
had
been
easily
satisfied
that
larry
the
bat
was
not
within
too
easily
satisfied
jimmie
dale
turned
the
key
noiselessly
in
the
lock
he
opened
the
door
cautiously
half
inch
an
inch
there
was
no
sound
of
footsteps
now
occasionally
a
lodger
moved
about
on
the
floor
above
occasionally
from
somewhere
in
the
tenement
came
the
murmur
of
voices
as
from
behind
closed
door
that
was
all
all
else
was
silence
and
darkness
now
the
door
on
its
hinges
swung
wide
open
jimmie
dale
thrust
out
his
head
into
the
hall
and
something
fell
upon
the
threshold
with
a
little
thud
but
for
a
moment
jimmie
dale
did
not
move
listening
trying
to
pierce
the
darkness
he
was
as
still
as
the
silence
around
him
then
he
stooped
and
groped
along
the
threshold
his
hand
closed
upon
what
seemed
like
a
small
box
wrapped
in
paper
he
picked
it
up
closed
and
locked
the
door
again
and
retreated
back
across
the
room
it
was
strange
unpleasantly
strange
a
box
propped
stealthily
against
the
door
so
that
it
would
fall
to
the
threshold
when
the
door
was
opened
and
why
the
stealth
what
did
it
mean
had
the
underworld
with
its
thousand
eyes
and
ears
already
succeeded
in
a
few
days
where
the
police
had
failed
signally
for
years
had
they
sent
him
this
whatever
it
was
as
some
grim
token
that
they
had
run
larry
the
bat
to
earth
he
shook
his
head
no
gangland
struck
more
swiftly
with
less
finesse
than
that
the
act
was
never
one
it
favoured
for
the
mouse
had
been
known
to
get
away
jimmie
dale
lighted
the
gas
again
and
turned
the
package
over
in
his
hands
it
was
as
he
had
surmised
a
small
cardboard
box
and
it
was
wrapped
in
plain
paper
and
tied
with
a
string
he
untied
the
string
and
still
suspicious
as
a
man
is
suspicious
in
the
knowledge
that
he
is
stalked
by
peril
at
every
turn
removed
the
wrapper
a
little
gingerly
it
was
still
without
sign
or
marking
upon
it
just
an
ordinary
cardboard
box
he
lifted
off
the
cover
and
with
a
short
sudden
laugh
stared
a
little
out
of
countenance
at
the
contents
on
the
top
lay
a
white
unaddressed
envelope
hers
beneath
he
emptied
the
box
on
the
table
his
black
silk
mask
his
automatic
revolver
the
kit
of
fine
small
burglar
tools
his
pocket
flashlight
and
the
thin
metal
insignia
case
the
tocsin
impulsively
jimmie
dale
turned
toward
the
door
and
stopped
his
shoulders
lifted
in
a
shrug
that
meant
to
be
philosophical
was
far
from
philosophical
he
could
not
dared
not
venture
far
through
the
tenement
dressed
as
he
was
and
even
if
he
could
there
were
three
exits
to
the
sanctuary
a
fact
that
now
for
the
first
time
was
not
wholly
a
source
of
unmixed
satisfaction
to
him
and
besides
she
was
gone
jimmie
dale
opened
the
letter
a
grim
smile
playing
on
his
lips
he
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
that
the
illusion
he
had
cherished
for
years
in
the
belief
that
she
did
not
know
larry
the
bat
as
an
alias
of
jimmie
dale
was
no
more
than
an
illusion
well
it
had
been
a
piece
of
consummate
egotism
on
his
part
that
was
all
but
after
all
what
did
it
matter
he
had
had
his
innings
tried
in
the
role
of
larry
the
bat
to
solve
her
identity
devoted
weeks
on
end
to
the
attempt
and
failed
some
day
perhaps
his
turn
would
come
some
day
perhaps
she
would
no
longer
be
able
to
elude
him
unless
the
letter
crackled
suddenly
in
his
fingers
unless
the
house
that
they
had
built
on
such
strange
and
perilous
foundations
crashed
at
some
moment
without
an
warning
in
disaster
and
ruin
to
the
ground
who
knew
but
that
this
letter
now
another
call
to
the
gray
seal
to
act
another
peril
invited
would
be
the
last
there
must
be
an
end
some
day
luck
and
nerve
had
their
limitations
it
had
almost
ended
last
week
dear
philanthropic
crook
it
was
the
same
inevitable
beginning
you
are
well
enough
again
are
you
jimmie
i
am
sending
these
little
things
back
to
you

you
will
need

jimmie
dale
too
intent
now
to
mutter
read
on
silently
at
the
end
he
shuffled
the
sheets
a
little
abstractedly
as
his
face
hardened
then
his
fingers
began
to
tear
the
letter
into
little
shreds
tearing
it
over
and
over
again
tearing
the
shreds
into
tiny
particles
he
had
not
been
far
wrong
from
what
the
night
promised
now
this
might
well
be
the
last

who
knew
there
would
be
need
of
all
the

and
luck
and
nerve
that
the

ever
had
before
with
a
jerk
jimmie
dale
roused
himself
from
the
momentary
reverie
into
which
he
had
fallen
and
all
action
now
stuffed
the
torn
pieces
of
the
letter
into
his
trousers
pocket
to
be
disposed
of
later
in
the

took
off
the

and
slouch

again
and
resumed
the

of

this
accomplished
he
replaced
the
planking
and
oilcloth
stood
up
put
on
his

and
from

stowed
the

the

and
the
thin
metal

away
in

jimmie
dale
raised
his
hand
to
the
gas
fixture
circled
the
room
with
a
glance
that
missed
no
single
detail
then
the
light
went
out
the
door
closed
behind
him
locked
a
dark
shadow
crept
silently
down
the
stairs
out
through
the
side
door
into
the
alleyway
along
the
alleyway
close
to
the
wall
of
the
tenement
where
it
was
blackest
and
satisfied
that
for
the
moment
there
were
no
emerged
on
the
street
walking
leisurely
toward
the
bowery
once
well
away
from
the
sanctuary
however
jimmie
dale
quickened
his
steps
and
twenty
minutes
later
having
stopped
but
once
to
telephone
to
his
home
on
riverside
drive
for
his
touring
car
he
was
briskly
mounting
the
steps
of
the
james
club
on
fifth
avenue
another
twenty
minutes
after
that
and
he
had
dismissed
benson
his
chauffeur
and
at
the
wheel
of
his
big
powerful
machine
was
speeding
uptown
for
the
hotel
it
was
twelve
minutes
after
nine
when
he
drew
up
at
the
curb
in
front
of
the
side
entrance
of
the
hotel
his
watch
set
by
guesswork
had
been
a
little
slow
and
he
had
corrected
it
at
the
club
he
was
replacing
the
watch
in
his
pocket
as
he
sauntered
around
the
corner
and
passed
in
through
the
main
entrance
to
the
big
lobby
jimmie
dale
avoided
the
elevators
it
was
only
one
flight
up
and
elevator
boys
on
occasions
had
been
known
to
be
observant
at
the
top
of
the
first
landing
a
long
wide
heavily
carpeted
corridor
was
before
him
number
one
hundred
and
the
corner
room
on
the
right
the
tocsin
had
said
jimmie
dale
walked
nonchalantly
along
past
no
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
a
group
of
people
were
gathered
around
the
elevator
doors
halfway
down
the
corridor
a
bell
boy
came
out
of
a
room
and
went
ahead
of
jimmie
dale
and
then
jimmie
dale
stopped
suddenly
and
began
to
retrace
his
steps
the
group
had
entered
the
elevator
the
bell
boy
had
disappeared
around
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
into
the
wing
of
the
hotel
the
corridor
was
empty
in
a
moment
he
was
standing
before
the
door
of
no
in
another
under
the
persuasion
of
a
little
steel
instrument
deftly
manipulated
by
jimmie
dale
slim
tapering
fingers
the
lock
clicked
back
the
door
opened
and
he
stepped
inside
closing
and
locking
the
door
again
behind
him
it
was
already
a
quarter
past
nine
but
no
one
was
as
yet
in
the
connecting
room
the
fanlight
next
door
had
been
dark
as
he
passed
his
flashlight
swept
about
him
located
the
connecting
door
and
went
out
he
moved
to
the
door
tried
it
and
found
it
locked
again
the
little
steel
instrument
came
into
play
released
the
lock
and
jimmie
dale
opened
the
door
again
the
flashlight
winked
the
door
opened
into
a
bathroom
that
obviously
at
will
was
either
common
to
the
two
rooms
or
could
by
the
simple
expedient
of
locking
one
door
or
the
other
be
used
by
one
of
the
rooms
alone
in
the
present
instance
the
occupant
of
the
adjoining
apartment
had
taken
a
room
with
a
jimmie
dale
passed
through
the
bathroom
to
the
opposite
door
this
was
already
open
and
swung
outward
into
the
bedroom
near
the
lower
end
of
the
room
by
the
window
through
the
crack
of
the
door
by
the
hinges
jimmie
dale
flashed
his
light
testing
the
radius
of
vision
pushed
the
door
a
few
inches
wider
open
tested
it
again
with
the
flashlight
and
retreated
back
into
no
closing
the
door
on
his
side
until
it
was
just
ajar
he
stood
there
then
silently
waiting
it
was
hamvert
room
next
door
and
hamvert
and
the
weasel
were
already
late
a
step
sounded
outside
in
the
corridor
jimmie
dale
straightened
intently
the
step
passed
on
down
the
hallway
and
died
away
a
false
alarm
jimmie
dale
smiled
whimsically
it
was
a
strange
adventure
this
that
confronted
him
quite
the
strangest
in
a
way
that
the
tocsin
had
ever
planned
and
the
night
lay
before
him
full
of
peril
in
its
extraordinary
complications
to
win
the
hand
he
must
block
hamvert
and
the
weasel
without
allowing
them
an
inkling
that
his
interference
was
anything
more
than
say
the
luck
of
a
hotel
sneak
thief
at
most
the
weasel
was
a
dangerous
man
one
of
the
slickest
workers
in
the
country
with
safe
cracking
as
one
of
his
favourite
pursuits
a
man
most
earnestly
desired
by
the
police
provided
the
latter
could
catch
him
with
the
as
for
hamvert
he
did
not
know
hamvert
who
was
a
stranger
in
new
york
except
that
hamvert
had
fleeced
a
man
named
michael
breen
out
of
his
share
in
a
claim
they
had
had
together
when
breen
had
first
gone
to
alaska
to
try
his
luck
and
now
having
discovered
that
breen
when
prospecting
alone
somewhere
in
the
interior
a
month
or
so
ago
had
found
a
rich
vein
and
had
made
a
map
or
diagram
of
its
location
he
hamvert
had
followed
the
other
to
new
york
for
the
purpose
of
getting
it
by
hook
or
crook
breen
find
had
been
too
late
taken
sick
he
had
never
worked
his
claim
had
barely
got
back
home
before
he
died
and
only
in
time
to
hand
his
wife
the
strange
legacy
of
a
roughly
scrawled
little
piece
of
paper
and
jimmie
dale
straightened
up
alertly
once
more
steps
again
and
this
time
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
elevator
then
voices
then
the
opening
of
the
door
of
the
next
room
then
a
voice
distinctly
audible
pull
up
a
chair
and
we

down
to
business

as
it

any
time
to

another
voice
quite
evidently
the
weasel
do
youse
worry
de
game
cinched
to
a
there
was
the
sound
of
chairs
being
moved
across
the
floor
jimmie
dale
slipped
the
black
silk
mask
over
his
face
opened
the
door
on
his
side
of
the
bathroom
cautiously
and
without
a
sound
stepped
into
the
bathroom
that
was
lighted
now
of
course
by
the
light
streaming
in
through
the
partially
opened
door
of
hamvert
room
the
two
were
talking
earnestly
now
in
lower
tones
jimmie
dale
only
caught
a
word
here
and
there
his
faculties
for
the
moment
were
concentrated
on
traversing
the
bathroom
silently
he
reached
the
farther
door
crouched
there
peered
through
the
crack
and
the
old
whimsical
smile
flickered
across
his
lips
again
the
was
high
class
and
exclusive
and
the
weasel
for
once
looked
quite
the
gentleman
and
for
all
his
sharp
ferret
face
not
entirely
out
of
keeping
with
his
surroundings
else
he
would
never
have
got
farther
than
the
lobby
the
other
was
a
short
thickset
man
with
a
great
shock
of
sandy
hair
and
small
black
eyes
that
looked
furtively
out
from
overhanging
bushy
eyebrows
well
hamvert

saying

agreed
hamvert
briskly
and
from
his
inside
pocket
produced
a
package
of
crisp
new
bills
and
evidently
of
large
denominations
half
down
and
half
on
delivery
that
our
dat
wot
assented
the
weasel
curtly
hamvert
began
to
count
the
bills
jimmie
dale
hand
stole
into
his
pocket
and
came
out
with
his
handkerchief
and
the
thin
metal
insignia
case
from
the
latter
with
its
little
pair
of
tweezers
he
took
out
one
of
the
adhesive
gray
seals
his
eyes
warily
on
the
two
men
he
dropped
the
seal
on
his
handkerchief
restored
the
thin
metal
case
to
his
pocket
and
in
its
stead
the
ugly
muzzle
of
his
automatic
peeped
from
between
his
fingers
five
thousand
down
said
hamvert
pushing
a
pile
of
notes
across
the
table
and
tucking
the
remainder
back
into
his
pocket
and
the
other
five
here
for
you
when
you
get
back
with
the
map
ordinarily
i
would
pay
a
penny
in
advance
but
since
you
want
it
that
way
and
the
map
no
good
to
you
while
the
rest
of
the
long
green
is
i
he
swallowed
his
words
with
a
startled
gulp
clutched
hastily
at
the
money
on
the
table
and
began
to
struggle
up
from
his
chair
to
his
feet
with
a
swift
noiseless
through
the
open
door
jimmie
dale
was
standing
in
the
room
jimmie
dale
tones
were
conversational
do
get
up
said
jimmie
dale
coolly
and
take
your
hand
off
that
money
the
weasel
whose
back
had
been
to
the
door
squirmed
around
in
his
chair
and
in
his
turn
stared
into
the
muzzle
of
jimmie
dale
revolver
while
his
jaw
dropped
and
sagged
weasel
observed
jimmie
dale
casually
i
seem
to
be
in
luck
i
got
into
that
room
next
door
but
an
empty
room
is
slim
picking
and
then
it
seemed
to
me
i
heard
some
one
in
here
mention
five
thousand
dollars
twice
which
makes
ten
thousand
and
which
happens
to
be
just
exactly
the
sum
i
need
at
the
present
moment
if
i
ca
get
any
more
i
have
the
honour
of
your
wealthy
friend
acquaintance
but
i
am
really
charmed
to
meet
him

sound
might
prove
extremely
hamvert
face
was
white
and
he
stirred
uneasily
in
his
chair
but
into
the
weasel
face
the
first
shock
of
surprised
dismay
past
came
a
dull
angry
red
and
into
the
eyes
a
vicious
gleam
and
suddenly
he
laughed
shortly
why

damned

so
weasel
inquired
jimmie
dale
politely
he
carried
his
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
to
cloak
a
cough
and
his
tongue
touched
the
adhesive
side
of
the
little
gray
seal
hand
and
handkerchief
came
back
to
the
table
and
jimmie
dale
leaned
his
weight
carelessly
upon
it
while
the
automatic
in
his
right
hand
still
covered
the
two
men
do
you
think
so
weasel
he
repeated
softly
well
perhaps
you
are
right
and
yet
somehow
i
am
inclined
to
disagree
with
you
let
me
see
weasel
it
was
tuesday
night
two
nights
ago
it
that
a
trifling
break
in
maiden
lane
at
thorold
and
sons
disturbed
the
police
it
was
a
job
for
even
a
first
offender
ten
for
one
already
on
nodding
terms
with
the
police
and
fifteen
to
twenty
for
well
say
for
a
man
like
you
weasel
if
he
were
caught
am
i
making
myself
quite
plain
the
colour
in
the
weasel
cheeks
faded
a
little
his
eyes
were
holding
in
sudden
fascination
upon
jimmie
dale
i
see
that
i
am
observed
jimmie
dale
pleasantly
i
said
he
were
caught
you
will
remember
i
am
going
to
leave
this
room
in
a
moment
weasel
and
leave
it
entirely
to
your
discretion
as
to
whether
you
will
think
it
wise
or
not
to
stir
from
that
chair
for
ten
minutes
after
i
shut
the
door
and
now
jimmie
dale
nonchalantly
replaced
his
handkerchief
in
his
pocket
nonchalantly
followed
it
with
the
banknotes
which
he
picked
up
from
the
table
and
smiled
with
a
gasp
both
men
had
strained
forward
and
were
staring
at
the
gray
seal
stuck
between
them
on
the
tabletop
the
gray
seal
whispered
the
weasel
and
his
tongue
circled
his
lips
jimmie
dale
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
was
a
bit
theatrical
weasel
he
said
apologetically
and
yet
not
wholly
unnecessary
you
will
recall
stangeist
the
mope
australian
ike
and
clarie
deane
and
can
draw
your
own
inference
as
to
what
might
happen
in
the
thorold
affair
if
you
should
be
so
as
to
force
my
hand
permit
me
the
slim
deft
fingers
like
a
streak
of
lightning
were
inside
hamvert
coat
pocket
and
out
again
with
the
remainder
of
the
banknotes
and
jimmie
dale
was
backing
for
the
door
not
the
door
of
the
bathroom
by
which
he
had
entered
but
the
door
of
the
room
itself
that
opened
on
the
corridor
there
he
stopped
and
his
hand
swept
around
behind
his
back
and
turned
the
key
in
the
locked
door
he
nodded
at
the
two
men
whose
faces
were
working
with
incongruously
mingled
expressions
of
impotent
rage
bewilderment
fear
and
fury
and
opened
the
door
a
little
ten
minutes
weasel
he
said
gently
i
trust
you
will
not
have
to
use
heroic
measures
to
restrain
your
friend
for
that
length
of
time
though
if
it
is
necessary
i
should
advise
you
for
your
own
sake
to
resort
almost
to
murder
i
wish
you
good
evening
the
door
opened
farther
jimmie
dale
still
facing
inward
slipped
between
it
and
the
jamb
whipped
the
mask
from
his
face
closed
the
door
softly
stepped
briskly
but
without
any
appearance
of
haste
along
the
corridor
to
the
stairs
descended
the
stairs
mingled
with
a
crowd
in
the
lobby
for
an
instant
walked
seemingly
a
part
of
it
with
a
group
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
down
the
hall
to
the
side
entrance
passed
out
and
a
moment
later
after
drawing
on
a
linen
dust
coat
which
he
took
from
under
the
seat
and
exchanging
his
hat
for
a
tweed
cap
the
car
glided
from
the
curb
and
was
lost
in
a
press
of
traffic
around
the
corner
jimmie
dale
laughed
a
little
harshly
to
himself
so
far
so
good
but
the
game
was
not
ended
yet
for
all
the
crackle
of
the
crisp
notes
in
his
pocket
there
was
still
the
map
still
the
robbery
at
house
the
theft
would
not
in
any
way
change
that
and
it
was
a
question
of
time
now
to
forestall
any
move
the
weasel
might
make
through
the
city
jimmie
dale
alternately
dodged
spurted
and
dragged
his
way
fuming
with
impatience
but
once
out
on
the
country
roads
and
headed
toward
new
rochelle
the
big
machine
speed
limits
thrown
to
the
winds
roared
through
the
night
a
gray
streak
of
road
jumping
under
the
powerful
lamps
a
village
a
town
a
cluster
of
lights
flashing
by
him
the
steady
purr
of
his
engines
the
gray
thread
of
open
road
again
it
was
just
eleven
when
jimmie
dale
the
road
to
himself
for
the
moment
at
a
spot
a
little
beyond
new
rochelle
extinguished
his
lights
and
very
carefully
ran
his
car
off
the
road
backing
it
in
behind
a
small
clump
of
trees
he
tossed
the
linen
dust
coat
back
into
the
car
and
set
off
toward
where
a
little
distance
away
the
slap
of
waves
from
the
stiff
breeze
that
was
blowing
indicated
the
shore
line
of
the
sound
there
was
no
moon
and
while
it
was
not
particularly
dark
objects
and
surroundings
at
best
were
blurred
and
indistinct
but
that
after
all
was
a
matter
of
little
concern
to
jimmie
dale
the
first
house
beyond
was
mittel
he
reached
the
water
edge
and
kept
along
the
shore
there
should
be
a
little
wharf
she
had
said
yes
there
it
was
and
there
too
was
a
gleam
of
light
from
the
house
itself
jimmie
dale
began
to
make
an
accurate
mental
note
of
his
surroundings
from
the
little
wharf
on
which
he
now
stood
a
path
led
straight
to
the
house
bisecting
what
appeared
to
be
a
lawn
trees
to
the
right
the
house
to
the
left
at
the
wharf
beside
him
two
motor
boats
were
moored
one
on
each
side
jimmie
dale
glanced
at
them
and
suddenly
attracted
by
the
familiar
appearance
of
one
inspected
it
a
little
more
closely
his
momentarily
awakened
interest
passed
as
he
nodded
his
head
it
had
caught
his
attention
that
was
all
it
was
the
same
type
and
design
quite
a
popular
make
of
which
there
were
hundreds
around
new
york
as
the
one
he
had
bought
that
year
as
a
tender
for
his
yacht
he
moved
forward
now
toward
the
house
the
rear
of
which
faced
him
the
light
that
flooded
the
lawn
came
from
a
side
window
jimmie
dale
was
figuring
the
time
and
distance
from
new
york
as
he
crept
cautiously
along
how
quickly
could
the
weasel
make
the
journey
the
weasel
would
undoubtedly
come
and
if
there
was
a
convenient
train
it
might
prove
a
close
race
but
in
his
own
favour
was
the
fact
that
it
would
probably
take
the
weasel
quite
some
little
time
to
recover
his
equilibrium
from
his
encounter
with
the
gray
seal
in
the
also
the
further
fact
that
from
the
weasel
viewpoint
there
was
no
desperate
need
of
haste
jimmie
dale
crossed
the
lawn
and
edged
along
in
the
shadows
of
the
house
to
where
the
light
streamed
out
from
what
now
proved
to
be
open
french
windows
it
was
a
fair
presumption
that
he
would
have
an
hour
to
the
good
on
the
weasel
the
sill
was
little
more
than
a
couple
of
feet
from
the
ground
and
from
a
crouched
position
on
his
knees
below
the
window
jimmie
dale
raised
himself
slowly
and
peered
guardedly
inside
the
room
was
empty
he
listened
a
moment
the
black
silk
mask
was
on
his
face
again
and
with
a
quick
agile
silent
spring
he
was
in
the
room
and
then
in
the
centre
of
the
room
jimmie
dale
stood
motionless
staring
around
him
an
expression
ironical
sardonic
creeping
into
his
face
the
robbery
had
already
been
committed
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
everything
was
in
confusion
the
door
of
a
safe
swung
wide
the
drawers
of
a
desk
had
been
wrenched
out
even
a
liqueur
stand
on
which
were
decanters
had
been
broken
open
and
the
contents
of
safe
and
desk
the
thief
discards
as
it
were
littered
the
floor
in
all
directions
for
an
instant
jimmie
dale
his
eyes
narrowed
ominously
surveyed
the
scene
then
with
a
sort
of
professional
instinct
aroused
he
stepped
forward
to
examine
the
safe
and
suddenly
darted
behind
the
desk
instead
steps
sounded
in
the
hall
the
door
opened
a
voice
reached
him
the
master
said
i
was
to
shut
the
windows
and
i
have
dast
to
go
in
and
he
be
back
with
the
police
in
a
minute
now
come
on
in
with
me
lord
exclaimed
another
voice
ai
it
a
good
thing
the
missus
is
away
she
have
highsteericks
steps
came
somewhat
hesitantly
across
the
floor
from
behind
the
desk
jimmie
dale
could
see
that
it
was
a
maid
accompanied
by
a
big
rawboned
woman
sleeves
rolled
to
the
elbows
over
brawny
arms
presumably
the
mittels
cook
the
maid
closed
the
french
windows
there
were
no
others
in
the
room
and
bolted
them
and
having
gained
a
little
confidence
gazed
about
her
my
but
was
he
cute
she
ejaculated
cut
the
telephone
wires
he
did
and
ai
he
made
an
awful
mess
but
the
master
said
we
was
to
touch
nothing
till
the
police
saw
and
to
think
of
it
happening
in
our
house
observed
the
cook
heavily
her
hands
on
her
hips
her
arms
akimbo
it
all
be
in
the
papers
and
mabbe
they
put
our
pictures
in
i
wo
get
over
it
as
long
as
i
live
declared
the
maid
the
yell
mittel
gave
when
he
came
downstairs
and
put
his
head
in
here
and
then
him
shouting
and
using
the
most
terrible
language
into
the
telephone
and
then
finding
the
wires
cut
and
me
following
him
downstairs
half
dead
with
fright
and
he
shouts
at
me
he
shouts
those
windows
but
do
you
touch
a
thing
in
that
room
i
going
for
the
police
and
then
he
rushes
out
of
the
i
was
going
to
bed
said
the
cook
picking
up
her
cue
for
what
was
probably
the
twentieth
rehearsal
of
the
scene
when
i
heard
mittel
yell
and
lord
bella
there
he
is
now
jimmie
dale
hands
clenched
he
too
had
caught
the
scuffle
of
footsteps
those
of
three
or
four
men
at
least
on
the
front
porch
there
was
one
way
only
one
of
escape
through
the
french
windows
it
was
a
matter
of
seconds
only
before
mittel
with
the
police
at
his
heels
would
be
in
the
room
and
jimmie
dale
sprang
to
his
feet
there
was
a
wild
scream
of
terror
from
the
maid
echoed
by
another
from
the
cook
and
still
screaming
both
women
fled
for
the
door
mr
mittel
mittel
shrieked
the
maid
she
had
flung
herself
out
into
the
hall
he
he
back
again
jimmie
dale
was
at
the
french
windows
tearing
at
the
bolts
they
stuck
shouts
came
from
the
front
entryway
he
wrenched
viciously
at
the
fastenings
they
gave
now
the
windows
flew
open
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
a
man
mittel
presumably
since
he
was
the
only
one
not
in
uniform
was
springing
into
the
room
there
was
a
blur
of
forms
and
brass
buttons
behind
mittel
and
jimmie
dale
leaped
to
the
lawn
speeding
across
it
like
a
deer
but
quick
as
he
ran
jimmie
dale
brain
was
quicker
pointing
the
single
chance
that
seemed
open
to
him
the
motor
boat
it
seemed
like
a
piece
of
luck
that
he
had
noticed
it
was
like
his
own
there
would
be
no
blind
and
that
meant
fatal
blunders
in
the
dark
over
its
mechanism
and
he
could
start
it
up
in
a
moment
just
the
time
to
cast
her
off
that
was
all
he
needed
the
shouts
swelled
behind
him
jimmie
dale
was
running
for
his
life
he
flung
a
glance
backward
one
form
mittel
he
was
certain
was
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
in
the
rear
the
others
were
just
emerging
from
the
french
windows
grotesque
leaping
things
they
looked
in
the
light
that
streamed
out
behind
them
from
the
room
jimmie
dale
feet
pounded
the
planking
of
the
wharf
he
stooped
and
snatched
at
the
mooring
line
mittel
was
almost
at
the
wharf
it
seemed
an
age
a
year
to
jimmie
dale
before
the
line
was
clear
shouts
rang
still
louder
across
the
lawn
the
police
racing
in
a
pack
were
more
than
halfway
from
the
house
he
flung
the
line
into
the
boat
sprang
in
after
it
and
mittel
looming
over
him
grasped
at
the
boat
gunwhale
both
men
were
panting
from
their
exertions
let
go
snarled
jimmie
dale
between
clenched
teeth
mittel
answer
was
a
hoarse
gasping
shout
to
the
police
to
hurry
and
then
mittel
reeled
back
measuring
his
length
upon
the
wharf
from
a
blow
with
a
boat
hook
full
across
the
face
driven
with
a
sudden
untamed
savagery
that
seemed
for
the
moment
to
have
mastered
jimmie
dale
there
was
no
time
not
a
second
not
the
fraction
of
a
second
desperately
frantically
he
shoved
the
boat
clear
of
the
wharf
once
twice
three
times
he
turned
the
engine
over
without
success
and
then
the
boat
leaped
forward
jimmie
dale
snatched
the
mask
from
his
face
and
jumped
for
the
steering
wheel
the
police
were
rushing
out
along
the
wharf
he
could
just
faintly
discern
mittel
now
the
man
was
staggering
about
his
hands
clapped
to
his
face
a
peremptory
order
to
halt
coupled
with
a
threat
to
fire
rang
out
sharply
and
jimmie
dale
flung
himself
flat
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
wharf
edge
seemed
to
open
in
little
crackling
jets
of
flame
came
the
roar
of
reports
like
a
miniature
battery
in
action
then
the
flop
flop
flop
as
the
lead
tore
up
the
water
around
him
the
duller
thud
as
a
bullet
buried
its
nose
in
the
boat
side
and
the
curious
rip
and
squeak
as
a
splinter
flew
then
mittel
voice
as
though
in
pain
ca
any
of
you
run
a
motor
boat
he
got
me
bad
i
afraid
that
other
one
there
is
twice
as
sure
another
voice
responded
promptly
and
if
that
right
he
run
his
head
into
a
trap
cast
loose
there
macveay
and
pile
in
all
of
you
you
go
back
to
the
house
mittel
and
fix
yourself
up
get
him
jimmie
dale
lips
thinned
it
was
true
if
the
other
boat
had
any
speed
at
all
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
before
he
would
be
overtaken
the
only
point
at
issue
was
how
much
time
it
was
dark
that
was
in
his
favour
but
it
was
not
so
dark
but
that
a
boat
could
be
distinguished
on
the
water
for
quite
a
distance
for
a
longer
distance
than
he
could
hope
to
put
between
them
there
was
no
chance
of
eluding
the
police
that
way
the
keen
facile
brain
that
had
saved
the
gray
seal
a
hundred
times
before
was
weaving
planning
discarding
eliminating
scheming
a
way
out
with
death
ruin
disaster
the
price
of
failure
his
eyes
swept
the
dim
irregular
outline
of
the
shore
to
his
right
in
the
opposite
direction
from
where
he
had
left
his
car
and
perhaps
a
mile
ahead
as
well
as
he
could
judge
the
land
seemed
to
run
out
into
a
point

headed
for
it
instantly
if
he
could
reach
it
with
a
little
lead
to
the
good
there
was
a
chance
it
would
take
say
six
minutes
granting
the
boat
a
speed
of
ten
miles
an
hour
and
she
could
do
that
the
others
could
hardly
overtake
him
in
that
time
they
had
got
started
yet
he
could
hear
them
still
shouting
and
talking
at
the
wharf
and
twice
as
fast
was
undoubtedly
an
exaggeration
anyhow
a
minute
more
passed
another
and
then
astern
jimmie
dale
caught
the
racket
from
the
exhaust
of
a
engine
and
a
white
streak
seemed
to
shoot
out
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
from
where
obscured
now
he
placed
the
wharf
a
lead
roughly
four
hundred
yards
yes
he
had
as
much
as
that
but
that
too
was
very
little
he
bent
over
his
engine
coaxing
it
nursing
it
to
its
highest
efficiency
his
eyes
strained
now
upon
the
point
ahead
now
upon
his
pursuers
behind
he
was
running
with
the
wind
thank
heaven
or
the
small
boat
would
have
had
a
further
handicap
it
was
rolling
up
quite
a
sea
the
steering
gear
he
found
was
corded
along
the
side
of
the
boat
permitting
its
manipulation
from
almost
any
position
and
abruptly
now
jimmie
dale
left
the
engine
to
rummage
through
the
little
locker
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
but
as
he
rummaged
his
eyes
held
speculatively
on
the
boat
astern
she
was
gaining
unquestionably
steadily
but
not
as
fast
as
he
had
feared
he
would
still
have
a
hundred
yards
lead
at
least
abreast
the
point
and
he
was
smiling
grimly
now
a
hundred
yards
there
meant
life
to
the
gray
seal
the
locker
was
full
of
a
heterogeneous
collection
of
odds
and
ends
a
suit
of
oilskins
tools
tins
and
cans
of
various
sizes
and
descriptions
jimmie
dale
emptied
the
contents
some
sort
of
powder
of
a
small
round
tin
box
overboard
and
from
his
pocket
took
out
the
banknotes
crammed
them
into
the
box
crammed
his
watch
in
on
top
of
them
and
screwed
the
cover
on
tightly
his
fingers
were
flying
now
a
long
strip
torn
from
the
trousers
leg
of
the
oilskins
was
wrapped
again
and
again
around
the
box
and
the
box
was
stuffed
into
his
pocket
the
flash
of
a
revolver
shot
cut
the
blackness
behind
him
then
another
and
another
they
were
firing
in
a
continuous
stream
again
it
was
fairly
long
range
but
there
was
always
the
chance
of
a
stray
bullet
finding
its
mark
jimmie
dale
crouching
low
made
his
way
to
the
bow
of
the
boat
again
the
point
was
looming
almost
abreast
now
he
edged
in
nearer
to
hug
it
as
closely
as
he
dared
risk
the
depth
of
the
water
behind
remorselessly
the
other
boat
was
steadily
closing
the
gap
and
the
shots
were
not
all
wild
one
struck
with
a
curious
singing
sound
on
some
piece
of
metal
a
foot
from
his
elbow
closer
to
the
shore
running
now
parallel
with
the
head
of
the
point
jimmie
dale
again
edged
in
the
boat
his
jaws
clamped
working
in
little
twitches
and
then
suddenly
with
a
swift
appraising
glance
behind
him
he
swerved
the
boat
from
her
course
and
headed
for
the
shore
not
directly
but
diagonally
across
the
little
bay
that
on
the
farther
side
of
the
point
had
now
opened
out
before
him
he
was
close
in
with
the
edge
of
the
point
ten
yards
from
it
sweeping
past
it
the
point
itself
came
between
the
two
boats
hiding
them
from
each
other
and
jimmie
dale
with
a
long
spring
dove
from
the
boat
side
to
the
water
the
momentum
from
the
boat
as
he
sank
robbed
him
for
an
instant
of
all
control
over
himself
and
he
twisted
doubled
up
and
rolled
over
and
over
beneath
the
water
but
the
next
moment
his
head
was
above
the
surface
again
and
he
was
striking
out
swiftly
for
the
shore
it
was
only
a
few
yards
but
in
a
few
seconds
the
pursuing
boat
too
would
have
rounded
the
point
his
feet
touched
bottom
it
was
haste
now
nothing
else
that
counted
the
drum
of
the
racing
engines
the
crackling
roar
of
the
exhaust
from
the
oncoming
boat
was
in
his
ears
he
flung
himself
upon
the
shore
and
down
behind
a
rock
around
the
point
past
him
tore
the
police
boat
dark
forms
standing
clustered
in
the
bow
and
then
a
sudden
shout
there
she
is
see
her
she
heading
into
the
bay
for
the
shore
jimmie
dale
lips
relaxed
there
was
no
doubt
that
they
had
sighted
their
quarry
again
a
perfect
fusillade
of
revolver
shots
directed
at
the
now
empty
boat
was
quite
sufficient
proof
of
that
with
something
that
was
almost
a
chuckle
jimmie
dale
straightened
up
from
behind
the
rock
and
began
to
run
back
along
the
shore
the
little
motor
boat
would
have
grounded
long
before
they
overtook
her
and
thinking
naturally
enough
that
he
had
leaped
ashore
from
her
they
would
go
thrashing
through
the
woods
and
fields
searching
for
him
it
was
a
longer
way
back
by
the
shore
a
good
deal
longer
now
over
rough
rocky
stretches
where
he
stumbled
in
the
darkness
now
through
marshy
sodden
ground
where
he
sank
as
in
a
quagmire
time
and
again
over
his
ankles
it
was
even
longer
than
he
had
counted
on
and
time
with
the
weasel
on
one
hand
and
the
return
of
the
police
on
the
other
was
a
factor
to
be
reckoned
with
again
as
a
half
hour
later
jimmie
dale
stole
across
the
lawn
of
mittel
house
for
the
second
time
that
night
and
for
the
second
time
crouched
beneath
the
open
french
windows
masked
again
the
water
still
dripping
from
what
were
once
immaculate
evening
clothes
but
which
now
sagged
limply
about
him
his
collar
a
pasty
string
around
his
neck
the
mud
and
dirt
splashed
to
his
knees
jimmie
dale
was
a
disreputable
and
object
as
he
crouched
there
shivering
uncomfortably
from
his
immersion
in
spite
of
his
exertions
inside
the
room
mittel
passed
the
windows
pacing
the
floor
one
side
of
his
face
badly
cut
and
bruised
from
the
blow
with
the
boat
hook
and
as
he
passed
his
back
turned
for
an
instant
jimmie
dale
stepped
into
the
room
mittel
whirled
at
the
sound
and
with
a
suppressed
cry
instinctively
drew
back
jimmie
dale
automatic
was
dangling
carelessly
in
his
right
hand
i
am
afraid
i
am
a
trifle
melodramatic
observed
jimmie
dale
apologetically
surveying
his
own
bedraggled
person
but
i
assure
you
it
is
neither
intentional
nor
for
effect
as
it
is
i
was
afraid
i
would
be
late
pardon
me
if
i
take
the
liberty
of
helping
myself
one
gets
a
chill
in
wet
clothes
so
easily
he
passed
to
the
liqueur
stand
poured
out
a
generous
portion
from
one
of
the
decanters
and
tossed
it
off
mittel
neither
spoke
nor
moved
stupefaction
surprise
and
a
very
obvious
regard
for
jimmie
dale
revolver
mingled
themselves
in
a
helpless
expression
on
his
face
jimmie
dale
set
down
his
glass
and
pointed
to
a
chair
in
front
of
the
desk
sit
down
mittel
he
invited
pleasantly
it
will
be
quite
apparent
to
you
that
i
have
not
time
to
prolong
our
interview
unnecessarily
in
view
of
the
possible
return
of
the
police
at
any
moment
but
you
might
as
well
be
comfortable
you
will
pardon
me
again
if
i
take
another
liberty
he
crossed
the
room
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
of
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
and
returned
to
the
desk
sit
down
mittel
he
repeated
a
sudden
rasp
in
his
voice
mittel
none
too
graciously
now
seated
himself
look
here
my
fine
fellow
he
burst
out
you
carrying
things
with
a
pretty
high
hand
are
you
you
seem
to
have
eluded
the
police
for
the
moment
somehow
but
let
me
tell
you
i
no
interrupted
jimmie
dale
softly
let
me
tell
you
all
there
is
to
be
he
leaned
over
the
desk
and
stared
rudely
at
the
bruise
on
mittel
face
rather
a
nasty
crack
that
he
remarked
mittel
fists
clenched
and
an
angry
flush
swept
his
cheeks
i
have
made
it
a
good
deal
harder
said
jimmie
dale
with
sudden
insolence
if
i
had
been
afraid
of
putting
you
out
of
business
and
so
precluding
the
possibility
of
this
little
meeting
now
then
the
revolver
swung
upward
and
held
steadily
on
a
line
with
mittel
eyes
i
trouble
you
for
the
diagram
of
that
alaskan
claim
that
belongs
to
michael
breen
mittel
staring
fascinated
into
the
little
round
black
muzzle
of
the
automatic
edged
back
in
his
chair
so
so
that
what
you
after
is
it
he
jerked
out
well
he
laughed
unnaturally
and
waved
his
hand
at
the
disarray
of
the
room
it
been
stolen
i
know
that
said
jimmie
dale
grimly
by
you
me
mittel
started
up
in
his
chair
a
whiteness
creeping
into
his
face
me
i
i
sit
down
jimmie
dale
voice
rang
out
ominously
cold
i
have
any
time
to
spare
you
can
appreciate
that
but
even
if
the
police
return
before
that
map
is
in
my
possession
they
will
still
be
too
late
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
do
you
understand
furthermore
if
i
am
caught
you
are
ruined
let
me
make
it
quite
plain
that
i
know
the
details
of
your
little
game
you
are
a
curb
broker
mittel
ostensibly
in
reality
you
run
what
is
nothing
better
than
an
exceedingly
profitable
bucket
shop
the
weasel
has
been
a
customer
and
also
a
stool
for
you
for
years
how
hamvert
met
the
weasel
is
unimportant
he
came
east
with
the
intention
of
getting
in
touch
with
a
slick
crook
to
help
him
the
weasel
is
the
coincidence
that
is
all
i
quite
understand
that
you
have
never
met
hamvert
nor
hamvert
you
nor
that
hamvert
was
aware
that
you
and
the
weasel
had
anything
to
do
with
one
another
and
were
playing
in
together
but
that
equally
is
unimportant
when
hamvert
engaged
the
weasel
for
ten
thousand
dollars
to
get
the
map
from
you
for
him
the
weasel
chose
the
line
of
least
resistance
he
knew
you
and
approached
you
with
an
offer
to
split
the
money
in
return
for
the
map
it
was
not
a
question
of
your
accepting
his
offer
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
how
you
could
do
it
and
still
protect
yourself
the
weasel
was
well
qualified
to
point
the
way
a
fake
robbery
of
your
house
would
answer
the
purpose
admirably
you
could
not
be
held
either
legally
or
morally
responsible
for
a
document
that
was
placed
unsolicited
by
you
in
your
possession
if
it
were
stolen
from
mittel
face
was
ashen
colourless
his
hands
were
opening
and
shutting
with
nervous
twitches
on
the
top
of
the
desk
jimmie
dale
lips
curled
but
jimmie
dale
was
clipping
off
his
words
now
viciously
neither
you
nor
the
weasel
were
willing
to
trust
the
other
implicitly
perhaps
you
know
each
other
too
well
you
were
unwilling
to
turn
over
the
map
until
you
had
received
your
share
of
the
money
and
you
were
equally
unwilling
to
turn
it
over
until
you
were
safe
that
is
until
you
had
engineered
your
fake
robbery
even
to
the
point
of
notifying
the
police
that
it
had
been
committed
the
weasel
on
the
other
hand
had
some
scruples
about
parting
with
any
of
the
money
without
getting
the
map
in
one
hand
before
he
let
go
of
the
banknotes
with
the
other
it
was
very
simply
arranged
however
and
to
your
mutual
satisfaction
while
you
robbed
your
own
house
this
evening
he
was
to
get
half
the
money
in
advance
from
hamvert
giving
hamvert
to
understand
that
he
had
planned
to
commit
the
robbery
himself
he
was
to
come
out
here
then
receive
the
map
from
you
in
exchange
for
your
share
of
the
money
return
to
hamvert
with
the
map
and
receive
in
turn
his
own
share
i
might
say
that
hamvert
actually
paid
down
the
advance
and
it
was
perhaps
unfortunate
for
you
that
you
paid
such
scrupulous
attention
to
details
as
to
cut
your
own
telephone
wires
i
had
not
of
course
an
exact
knowledge
of
the
hour
or
minute
in
which
you
proposed
to
stage
your
little
play
here
the
object
of
my
first
visit
a
little
while
ago
was
to
forestall
your
turning
the
diagram
over
to
the
weasel
circumstances
favoured
you
for
the
moment
i
am
back
again
however
for
the
same
purpose
the
map
mittel
in
a
cowed
way
was
huddled
back
in
his
chair
he
smiled
miserably
at
jimmie
dale
quick
jimmie
dale
flung
out
the
word
in
a
sharp
peremptory
bark
do
you
need
to
be
told
that
the
cartridges
are
dry
mittel
hand
trembling
went
into
his
pocket
and
produced
an
envelope
open
it
commanded
jimmie
dale
and
lay
it
on
the
desk
so
that
i
can
read
it
i
am
too
wet
to
touch
mittel
obeyed
like
a
dog
that
has
been
whipped
a
glance
at
the
paper
and
jimmie
dale
eyes
lifted
again
to
sweep
the
floor
of
the
room
he
pointed
to
a
pile
of
books
and
documents
in
one
corner
that
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
safe
go
over
there
and
pick
up
that
check
book
he
ordered
tersely
what
for
mittel
made
feeble
protest
never
mind
what
for
snapped
jimmie
dale
go
and
get
it
and
hurry
once
more
mittel
obeyed
and
dropped
the
book
hesitantly
on
the
desk
jimmie
dale
stared
silently
insolently
contemptuously
at
the
other
mittel
stirred
uneasily
sat
down
shifted
his
feet
and
his
fingers
fumbled
aimlessly
over
the
top
of
the
desk
compared
with
you
said
jimmie
dale
in
a
low
voice
the
weasel
ay
and
hamvert
too
crooks
though
they
are
are
gentlemen
michael
breen
as
he
died
told
his
wife
to
take
that
paper
to
some
one
she
could
trust
who
would
help
her
and
tell
her
what
to
do
and
knowing
no
one
to
go
to
but
because
she
scrubbed
your
floors
and
therefore
thought
you
were
a
fine
gentleman
she
came
timidly
to
you
and
trusted
you
you
cur
jimmie
dale
laughed
suddenly
not
pleasantly
mittel
shivered
hamvert
and
breen
were
partners
out
there
in
alaska
when
breen
first
went
out
said
jimmie
dale
slowly
pulling
the
tin
can
wrapped
in
oilskin
from
his
pocket
hamvert
swindled
breen
out
of
the
one
strike
he
made
and
breen
and
her
little
girl
back
here
were
reduced
to
poverty
the
amount
of
that
swindle
was
i
understand
fifteen
thousand
dollars
i
have
ten
of
it
here
contributed
by
the
weasel
and
hamvert
and
you
will
i
think
recognise
therein
a
certain
element
of
poetic
justice
but
i
am
still
short
five
thousand
jimmie
dale
removed
the
cover
from
the
tin
can
mittel
gazed
at
the
contents
numbly
you
perhaps
did
not
hear
me
prompted
jimmie
dale
coldly
i
am
still
short
five
thousand
mittel
circled
his
lips
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
what
do
you
want
he
whispered
hoarsely
the
balance
of
the
there
was
an
ominous
quiet
in
jimmie
dale
voice
a
check
payable
to
michael
breen
for
five
thousand

i
have
got
that
much
in
the
bank

i
should
advise
you
to
see
that
you
have

morning
returned
jimmie
dale
curtly
make
out
that
check
mittel
hesitated
the
revolver
edged
insistently
a
little
farther
across
the
desk
and
mittel
picking
up
a
pen
wrote
feverishly
he
tore
the
check
from
its
stub
and
with
a
snarl
pushed
it
toward
jimmie
dale
fold
it
instructed
jimmie
dale
in
the
same
curt
tones
and
fold
that
diagram
with
it
put
them
both
in
this
box
thank
you
he
wrapped
the
oilskin
around
the
box
again
and
returned
the
box
to
his
pocket
and
again
with
that
insolent
contemptuous
stare
he
surveyed
the
man
at
the
desk
then
he
backed
to
the
french
windows
it
might

that

for

this

not

through
lack

an

by

was
on

sweat
glistened
on

my

cried
out
shrilly
who

jimmie

smiled
and
stepped
out
on

ask

the

lost

chapter
x
the
alibi
death
to
the
gray
seal
through
the
underworld
in
dens
and
dives
that
sheltered
from
the
law
the
vultures
that
preyed
upon
society
prompted
by
by
secret
dread
by
reason
of
their
very
inability
to
carry
out
their
purpose
the
whispered
sentence
grew
daily
more
venomous
more
insistent
the
gray
seal
dead
or
alive
but
the
gray
seal
it
was
the
standing
orders
of
the
police
railed
at
by
a
populace
who
angrily
demanded
at
its
hands
this
criminal
of
criminals
mocked
at
and
threatened
by
a
virulent
press
stung
to
madness
by
the
knowledge
of
its
own
impotence
flaunted
impudently
to
its
face
by
this
mysterious
gray
seal
to
whose
door
the
law
laid
a
hundred
crimes
for
whom
the
bars
of
a
death
cell
in
sing
sing
was
the
certain
goal
could
he
but
be
caught
the
police
to
a
man
was
like
an
uncaged
beast
that
flicked
to
the
raw
by
some
unseen
assailant
and
murderous
in
its
fury
was
crouched
to
strike
grim
paradox
a
common
bond
that
linked
the
hands
of
the
law
with
those
that
outraged
it
death
to
the
gray
seal
was
it
at
last
the
beginning
of
the
end
jimmie
dale
as
larry
the
bat
unkempt
disreputable
in
appearance
supposed
dope
fiend
a
figure
familiar
to
every
denizen
below
the
dead
line
skulked
along
the
narrow
street
of
the
east
side
that
on
the
corner
ahead
boasted
the
notorious
resort
to
which
bristol
bob
had
paid
the
doubtful
if
appropriate
compliment
of
giving
his
name
from
under
the
rim
of
his
battered
hat
jimmie
dale
eyes
veiled
by
lids
missed
no
detail
either
of
his
surroundings
or
pertaining
to
the
though
already
late
in
the
evening
children
played
in
the
gutters
hawkers
of
multitudinous
commodities
cried
their
wares
under
gasoline
banjo
torches
affixed
to
their
pushcarts
shawled
women
of
half
a
dozen
races
and
men
equally
cosmopolitan
loitered
at
the
curb
or
blocked
the
pavement
or
brushed
by
him
now
a
man
passed
him
flinging
a
greeting
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
now
another
always
without
movement
of
the
lips
and
jimmie
dale
answered
them
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
but
while
his
eyes
were
alert
his
mind
was
only
subconsciously
attune
to
his
surroundings
was
it
indeed
the
beginning
of
the
end
some
day
he
had
told
himself
often
enough
the
end
must
come
was
it
coming
now
surely
with
a
sort
of
grim
implacability
when
it
was
too
late
to
escape
slowly
but
inexorably
even
his
personal
freedom
of
action
was
narrowing
being
limited
and
ironically
enough
through
the
very
conditions
he
had
himself
created
as
an
avenue
of
escape
it
was
not
only
the
police
now
it
was
far
more
to
be
feared
the
underworld
as
well
in
the
old
days
the
role
of
larry
the
bat
had
been
assumed
at
intervals
at
his
own
discretion
when
in
a
corner
he
had
no
other
way
of
escape
now
it
was
forced
upon
him
almost
daily
the
character
of
larry
the
bat
could
no
longer
be
discarded
at
will
he
had
flung
down
the
gauntlet
to
the
underworld
when
as
the
gray
seal
he
had
closed
the
prison
doors
behind
stangeist
the
mope
australian
ike
and
clarie
deane
and
the
underworld
had
picked
the
gauntlet
up
betrayed
as
they
believed
by
the
one
who
though
unknown
to
them
they
had
counted
the
greatest
among
themselves
and
each
one
fearful
that
his
own
betrayal
might
come
next
every
crook
every
thug
in
the
bad
lands
now
eyed
his
oldest
pal
with
suspicion
and
distrust
and
each
was
a
sleuth
with
the
prod
of
behind
him
sworn
to
the
accomplishment
of
that
unhallowed
slogan
death
to
the
gray
seal
almost
daily
now
he
must
show
himself
as
larry
the
bat
in
some
gathering
of
the
underworld
a
prolonged
absence
from
his
haunts
was
not
merely
to
invite
certain
suspicion
where
all
were
suspicious
of
each
other
it
was
to
invite
certain
disaster
he
had
now
either
to
carry
the
role
like
a
little
old
man
of
the
sea
upon
his
back
or
renounce
it
forever
and
the
latter
course
he
dared
not
even
consider
the
sanctuary
was
still
the
sanctuary
and
the
role
of
larry
the
bat
was
still
a
refuge
the
trump
card
in
the
lone
hand
he
played
he
reached
the
corner
pushed
open
the
door
of
bristol
bob
and
shuffled
in
the
place
was
a
glare
of
light
a
hideous
riot
of
noise
on
a
polished
section
of
the
floor
in
the
centre
a
turkey
trot
was
in
full
swing
laughter
and
shouting
vied
raucously
with
an
impossible
orchestra
jimmie
dale
slowly
made
the
circuit
of
the
room
past
the
tables
that
ranged
around
the
sides
were
packed
with
occupants
who
thumped
their
glasses
in
tempo
with
the
music
and
clamoured
at
the
rushing
waiters
for
replenishment
a
dozen
two
dozen
men
and
women
greeted
him
jimmie
dale
indifferently
returned
their
salutes
what
a
galaxy
of
crooks
the
cream
of
the
underworld
his
eyes
under
lids
swept
the
faces
lags
dips
gatmen
yeggs
mob
stormers
murderers
petty
sneak
thieves
stalls
they
were
all
there
he
knew
them
all
he
was
known
to
all
he
shuffled
on
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
his
leer
a
little
arrogant
a
certain
arrogance
too
in
the
tilt
of
his
battered
hat
he
also
was
quite
a
celebrity
in
that
gathering
larry
the
bat
was
of
the
aristocracy
and
the
elite
of
gangland
well
the
show
was
over
he
had
stalked
across
the
stage
performed
for
his
audience
and
in
another
hour
now
free
until
he
must
repeat
the
same
performance
the
next
day
in
some
other
equally
notorious
dive
he
would
be
sitting
in
for
a
rubber
of
bridge
at
that
most
exclusive
of
all
clubs
the
james
where
none
might
enter
save
only
those
whose
names
were
vouched
for
in
the
highest
and
most
select
circles
and
where
for
partners
he
would
possibly
have
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
or
mayhap
an
eminent
divine
he
looked
suddenly
around
him
as
though
startled
it
always
startled
him
that
comparison
there
was
something
too
stupendous
to
be
simply
ironical
in
the
incongruity
of
it
if
if
he
were
ever
run
to
earth
his
eyes
met
those
of
a
man
the
chewed
end
of
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
who
stepped
from
behind
the
bar
carrying
a
tin
tray
with
two
full
glasses
upon
it
it
was
bristol
bob
the
proprietor
how
you
larry
grunted
the
man
with
what
he
meant
to
be
a
smile
jimmie
dale
was
standing
in
the
doorway
of
a
passage
that
prefaced
a
rear
exit
to
the
lane
he
moved
aside
to
allow
the
other
to
pass
bristol
he
returned
dispassionately
bristol
bob
went
on
along
down
the
passage
and
jimmie
dale
shuffled
slowly
after
him
he
had
intended
to
leave
the
place
by
the
rear
door
it
obviated
the
possibility
of
an
undesirable
acquaintance
joining
company
with
him
if
he
went
out
by
the
main
entrance
but
now
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
proprietor
back
with
a
sort
of
speculative
curiosity
there
was
a
private
room
off
the
passage
with
a
window
on
the
lane
but
they
must
be
favoured
customers
indeed
that
bristol
bob
would
condescend
to
serve
personally
any
one
who
knew
bristol
bob
knew
that
jimmie
dale
slowed
his
shuffling
gait
then
quickened
it
again
bristol
bob
opened
the
door
and
passed
into
the
private
room
the
door
was
just
closing
as
jimmie
dale
shuffled
by
he
had
had
only
a
glance
inside
but
it
was
enough
they
were
favoured
customers
indeed
it
was
no
wonder
that
bristol
bob
himself
was
on
the
job
two
men
were
in
the
room
lannigan
of
headquarters
rated
the
smartest
man
in
the
country
and
across
the
table
from
lannigan
whitey
mack
as
clever
finished
and
daring
a
crook
as
was
to
be
found
in
the
bad
lands
whose
particular
line
was
diamonds
or
in
the
vernacular
of
his
ilk
white
stones
that
had
earned
him
the
sobriquet
of
lannigan
of
headquarters
whitey
mack
of
the
underworld
sworn
enemies
those
two
in
secret
session
bristol
bob
might
well
play
the
part
of
outer
guard
if
a
choice
few
of
those
outside
in
the
dance
hall
could
get
a
glimpse
into
that
private
room
it
would
be
to
whitey
mack
jimmie
dale
eyes
were
narrowed
a
little
as
he
shuffled
on
down
the
passage
lannigan
and
whitey
mack
with
their
heads
together
what
was
the
game
there
was
nothing
in
common
between
the
two
men
lannigan
it
was
well
known
could
not
be
whitey
mack
with
his
ingenious
cleverness
coupled
with
a
fearlessness
that
had
made
him
an
object
of
unholy
awe
and
respect
in
the
eyes
of
the
underworld
was
a
thorn
that
was
sore
beyond
measure
in
the
side
of
the
police
certainly
it
was
no
ordinary
thing
that
had
brought
these
two
together
especially
since
with
the
unrest
and
suspicion
that
was
bubbling
and
seething
below
the
dead
line
and
with
which
there
was
none
more
intimate
than
whitey
mack
whitey
mack
was
inviting
a
risk
in
making
up
with
the
police
that
could
only
be
accounted
for
by
some
urgent
and
vital
incentive
jimmie
dale
pushed
open
the
door
that
gave
on
the
lane
behind
him
bristol
bob
closed
the
door
of
the
private
room
and
retreated
back
along
the
passage
jimmie
dale
stepped
out
into
the
lane
and
instinctively
his
eyes
sought
the
window
of
the
private
room
the
shade
was
drawn
only
a
yellow
murk
filtered
out
into
the
black
unlighted
lane
but
suddenly
he
started
noiselessly
toward
it
the
window
was
open
a
bare
inch
or
so
at
the
bottom
the
sill
was
just
shoulder
high
and
placing
his
ear
to
the
opening
he
flattened
himself
against
the
wall
he
could
not
see
inside
for
the
shade
was
drawn
well
to
the
bottom
but
he
could
hear
as
distinctly
as
though
he
were
at
the
table
beside
the
two
men
and
at
the
first
words
the
loose
disjointed
frame
of
larry
the
bat
seemed
to
tauten
curiously
and
strain
forward
lithe
and
tense
this
gray
seal
dope
listens
good
whitey
but
coming
from
you
leery
you
got
to
show
do
you
want
him
there
was
a
nasty
laugh
from
whitey
mack
you
bet
i
want
him
returned
the
headquarters
man
with
a
suppressed
savagery
that
left
no
doubt
as
to
his
earnestness
i
want
him
fast
enough
but
then
blast
him
so
do
i
whitey
mack
rapped
out
with
a
vicious
snarl
so
does
every
guy
in
the
fleet
down
here
we
got
it
in
for
him
you
get
that
do
you
he
got
stangeist
and
his
gang
steered
for
the
electric
chair
now
he
put
a
crimp
in
the
weasel
the
other
night
get
that
he
like
a
blasted
wizard
with
what
he
knows
and
who
he
deal
the
icy
mitt
to
next
me
damn
him
me
for
all
i
know
that
all
right
observed
lannigan
coolly
i
not
questioning
your
sincerity
for
a
minute
i
know
all
about
that
but
that
does
land
the
gray
seal
i
work
with
you
if
you
anything
to
offer
but
we
had
enough
and
handed
us
at
headquarters
in
the
last
few
years
to
make
us
a
trifle
skeptical
show
me
what
you
got
whitey
show
you
echoed
whitey
mack
passionately
sure
i
show
you
that
what
i
going
to
do
show
you
i
show
you
the
gray
seal
i
ai
handing
you
any
tips
i
found
out
who
the
gray
seal
is
there
was
a
tense
silence
it
seemed
to
jimmie
dale
as
though
cold
fingers
were
clutching
at
his
heart
stifling
its
beat
then
the
blood
came
bursting
to
his
forehead
he
could
not
see
into
the
room
but
that
silence
was
eloquent
it
seemed
as
though
he
could
picture
the
two
men
lannigan
leaning
suddenly
forward
lannigan
and
whitey
mack
staring
tensely
into
each
other
eyes
you
what
it
came
low
and
grim
from
lannigan
that
what
asserted
whitey
mack
bluntly
you
heard
me
that
what
i
said
i
know
who
the
gray
seal
is
and
i
the
only
guy
that
wise
to
him
am
i
letting
you
in
right
you
sure
demanded
lannigan
hoarsely
you
sure
who
is
he
then
there
was
a
half
laugh
half
snarl
from
whitey
mack
oh
no
you
do
he
growled
nix
on
that
what
do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
you
beat
it
out
of
here
and
round
him
up
eh
while
i
suck
my
thumbs
say
forget
it
do
you
think
i
doing
this
because
i
love
you
why
blame
you
you
been
aching
for
a
year
to
put
the
bracelets
on
me
yourself
say
wake
up
i
in
on
this
again
that
silence
then
lannigan
spoke
slowly
in
a
puzzled
way
i
do
get
you
whitey
he
said
what
do
you
mean
then
a
little
sharply
you
quite
right
you
got
some
reputation
yourself
and
you
badly
if
we
could
get
the
on
you
if
trying
to
plant
something
look
out
for
yourself
or
can
that
snapped
whitey
mack
threateningly
can
that
sort
of
spiel
right
now
or
quit
i
ai
telling
you
his
name
yet
but
i
take
you
to
him
and
you
and
me
nabs
him
together
is
that
straight
enough
goods
for
you
do
get
sore
said
lannigan
more
pacifically
yes
if
you
do
that
it
good
enough
for
any
man
but
lay
your
cards
on
the
table
face
up
whitey
i
want
to
see
what
you
opened
the
pot
you
seen
whitey
mack
answered
ungraciously
i
told
you
already
the
gray
seal
goes
out
for
keeps
curse
him
for
a
snitch
if
i
bumped
him
off
or
wised
up
any
of
the
guys
to
it
and
we
was
caught
we
get
the
juice
for
it
even
if
it
was
the
gray
seal
would
we
well
what
the
use
if
one
of
you
dicks
get
him
he
gets
bumped
off
just
the
same
only
regular
up
in
the
wire
parlour
at
sing
sing
i
ai
looking
for
that
kind
of
trouble
when
i
can
duck
it
see
sure
said
lannigan
besides
and
moreover
continued
whitey
mack
there
some
reward
hung
out
for
him
that
i
figuring
to
born
in
on
i
swipe
it
all
myself
do
you
make
any
mistake
about
that
and
you
never
get
a
only
sore
as
the
mob
is
on
the
gray
seal
it
ai
healthy
for
any
guy
around
these
parts
to
get
the
reputation
of
being
a
snitch
no
matter
who
he
snitches
on
bump
him
off
sure
snitching
well
you
get
the
idea
eh
i
ducking
that
too
get
me
i
get
you
said
lannigan
with
a
short
pleased
laugh
well
then
announced
whitey
mack
here
my
proposition
and
it
my
turn
to
hand
out
the
dope
i
busting
the
game
wide
open
for
you
to
play
but
you
throw
me
down
and
his
voice
sank
into
a
sullen
snarl
again
you
can
take
it
from
me
i
get
you
for
it
all
right
responded
lannigan
soberly
let
hear
it
if
i
agree
to
it
i
stick
to
i
believe
you
said
whitey
mack
curtly
that
why
i
picked
you
out
for
the
medal
they
pin
on
you
for
this
and
here
getting
down
to
tacks
i
lead
you
to
the
gray
seal
and
help
you
nab
him
and
stay
with
you
to
the
finish
but
there
to
be
nobody
but
you
and
me
on
the
job
when
it
done
i
fade
away
and
nobody
to
know
i
snitched
and
no
questions
asked
as
to
how
i
found
out
about
the
gray
seal
i
ai
looking
for
any
of
the
glory
you
can
fix
that
up
to
suit
yourself
the
cash
is
different
you
come
across
with
half
the
reward
the
day
they
pay
you
get
it
there
was
savage
elation
in
lannigan
voice
the
emphatic
smash
of
a
fist
on
the
table
you
on
whitey
and
if
we
get
the
gray
seal
i
do
better
by
you
than
we
get
him
said
whitey
mack
with
a
vicious
oath
and
jimmie
dale
crouched
suddenly
low
down
close
against
the
wall
the
crunch
of
a
footstep
sounded
from
the
end
of
the
lane
some
one
had
turned
in
from
the
cross
street
some
fifty
yards
away
and
was
heading
evidently
for
the
back
entrance
to
bristol
bob
jimmie
dale
edged
noiselessly
cautiously
back
past
the
doorway
kept
on
pressed
close
against
the
wall
and
finally
paused
he
had
not
been
seen
the
back
door
of
bristol
bob
opened
and
closed
the
man
had
gone
in
for
a
moment
jimmie
dale
stood
hesitant
there
was
a
wild
surging
in
his
brain
something
like
a
myriad
batteries
of
trip
hammers
seemed
to
be
pounding
at
his
temples
then
almost
blindly
he
kept
on
down
the
lane
in
the
same
direction
in
which
he
had
started
to
retreat
as
well
one
cross
street
as
another
he
turned
into
the
cross
street
went
along
it
and
presently
emerged
into
the
full
tide
of
the
bowery
it
was
garishly
lighted
people
swarmed
about
him
subconsciously
there
were
crowded
sidewalks
subconsciously
he
was
on
the
bowery
that
was
all
ruin
disaster
peril
faced
him
faced
him
and
staggered
him
with
the
suddenness
of
the
shock
was
it
true
no
it
could
not
be
true
it
was
a
bluff
whitey
mack
was
bluffing
jimmie
dale
lips
grew
thin
in
a
mirthless
smile
as
he
shook
his
head
neither
whitey
mack
nor
any
other
man
would
dare
to
bluff
like
that
it
was
too
straight
too
whitey
mack
had
laid
his
cards
too
plainly
on
the
table
whitey
words
rang
in
his
ears
i
lead
you
to
the
gray
seal
and
help
you
nab
him
and
stay
with
you
to
the
the
man
meant
what
he
said
meant
what
he
said
too
about
the
finish
of
the
gray
seal
not
a
man
in
the
bad
lands
but
meant
death
to
the
gray
seal
but
how
by
what
means
when
where
had
whitey
mack
got
his
information
i
the
only
one
that
wise
whitey
mack
had
said
it
seemed
impossible
it
was
impossible
whitey
mack
was
sincere
enough
probably
in
what
he
had
said
but
the
man
simply
could
not
know
whitey
mack
could
only
have
spotted
some
one
that
for
some
reason
or
other
he
imagined
was
the
gray
seal
that
was
it
must
be
it
whitey
mack
had
made
a
mistake
what
clew
could
he
have
obtained
to
over
the
unwashed
face
of
larry
the
bat
a
gray
pallor
spread
slowly
his
fingers
were
plucking
at
the
frayed
edge
of
his
inside
vest
pocket
the
dark
eyes
seemed
to
turn
a
laugh
like
the
laugh
of
one
damned
rose
to
his
lips
and
was
choked
back
it
was
gone
gone
that
thin
metal
case
like
a
cigarette
case
that
between
the
little
sheets
of
oil
paper
held
those
adhesive
seals
the
insignia
of
the
gray
seal
was
gone
clew
it
seemed
as
though
there
were
an
overpowering
nausea
upon
him
clew
that
little
case
was
not
a
clew
it
was
a
death
warrant
his
hands
clenched
fiercely
if
he
could
only
think
for
a
moment
the
lining
of
his
pocket
had
given
away
the
case
had
dropped
out
but
there
was
nothing
about
the
case
to
identify
any
one
as
the
gray
seal
unless
it
were
found
in
one
actual
possession
therefore
whitey
mack
to
have
solved
his
identity
must
have
seen
him
drop
the
case
there
could
be
no
question
about
that
it
was
equally
obvious
then
that
whitey
mack
would
know
the
gray
seal
as
larry
the
bat
did
he
also
know
him
as
jimmie
dale
yes
or
no
it
was
a
vital
question
his
life
hung
on
it
that
keen
facile
brain
numbed
for
the
moment
was
beginning
to
work
with
lightning
speed
it
was
four
that
afternoon
when
he
had
assumed
the
character
of
larry
the
bat
some
time
between
four
and
the
present
it
was
now
well
after
eleven
the
case
had
dropped
from
his
pocket
there
had
been
ample
time
then
for
whitey
mack
to
have
made
that
appointment
with
lannigan
and
ample
time
to
have
made
a
surreptitious
visit
to
the
sanctuary
had
whitey
mack
gone
there
had
whitey
mack
found
that
hiding
place
in
the
flooring
under
the
oilcloth
had
whitey
mack
discovered
that
the
gray
seal
was
not
only
larry
the
bat
but
jimmie
dale
jimmie
dale
swept
his
hand
across
his
forehead
it
was
damp
from
little
clinging
beads
of
moisture
should
he
go
to
the
sanctuary
and
change
become
jimmie
dale
again
was
it
the
safest
thing
to
do
or
the
most
dangerous
even
if
whitey
mack
had
been
there
and
discovered
the
dual
personality
of
larry
the
bat
how
would
he
jimmie
dale
know
it
the
man
would
have
been
crafty
enough
to
have
left
no
sign
behind
him
was
it
to
the
sanctuary
that
whitey
mack
meant
to
lead
lannigan
that
evening
or
did
whitey
mack
know
him
as
jimmie
dale
and
to
make
it
the
more
sensational
plan
to
carry
out
the
coup
say
at
the
james
club
whitey
mack
and
lannigan
were
still
at
bristol
bob
he
had
probably
time
if
he
so
elected
to
reach
the
sanctuary
change
and
get
away
again
but
every
minute
was
priceless
now
what
should
he
do
run
from
the
city
as
he
was
for
cover
or
take
the
gambler
chance
whitey
mack
knew
him
as
larry
the
bat
it
was
not
certain
that
whitey
mack
knew
him
as
jimmie
dale
he
had
halted
absorbed
in
front
of
a
theatre
great
placards
at
first
but
a
blur
of
colour
suddenly
forced
themselves
in
concrete
form
upon
his
consciousness
letters
a
foot
high
leaped
out
at
him
the
double
there
was
the
picture
of
a
banker
in
his
private
office
hastily
secreting
a
forged
paper
as
the
hero
in
the
guise
of
a
clerk
entered
the
companion
picture
was
the
banker
in
convict
stripes
staring
out
from
behind
the
barred
doors
of
a
cell
there
seemed
a
ghastly
augury
in
the
coincidence
why
should
a
thing
like
that
be
thrust
upon
him
to
shake
his
nerve
when
he
needed
nerve
now
more
than
he
had
ever
needed
it
in
his
life
before
he
raised
his
hand
to
jerk
aimlessly
at
the
brim
of
his
hat
dropped
his
hand
abruptly
to
his
side
again
and
started
quickly
hurriedly
away
through
the
throng
around
him
a
sort
of
savagery
had
swept
upon
him
in
a
flash
he
had
made
his
decision
he
would
take
the
gambler
chance
and
afterward
jimmie
dale
lips
were
like
a
thin
straight
line
it
was
whitey
mack
life
or
his
own
whitey
mack
had
said
he
was
the
only
one
that
was
wise
and
whitey
mack
had
not
told
lannigan
yet
tell
lannigan
until
the
if
he
jimmie
dale
got
to
the
sanctuary
became
jimmie
dale
and
got
away
again
even
if
whitey
mack
knew
him
as
jimmie
dale
there
was
still
a
chance
it
was
his
life
or
whitey
mack
whitey
mack
with
his
face
if
he
could
get
whitey
mack
before
the
other
was
ready
to
tell
lannigan
surely
he
had
the
right
of
surely
his
life
was
as
valuable
as
whitey
mack
as
valuable
as
a
man
who
as
those
in
the
secrets
of
the
underworld
knew
well
enough
had
blood
upon
his
hands
who
lived
by
crime
who
was
a
menace
to
the
community
had
he
not
the
right
to
preserve
his
own
life
at
the
expense
of
one
such
as
that
he
had
never
taken
life
the
thought
was
abhorrent
but
was
there
any
other
way
in
event
of
whitey
mack
knowing
him
as
jimmie
dale
his
back
was
against
the
wall
he
was
trapped
certain
death
and
worse
dishonour
stared
him
in
the
face
lannigan
and
whitey
mack
would
be
together
the
odds
would
be
two
to
one
against
him
and
he
had
no
quarrel
with
lannigan
somehow
he
must
let
lannigan
out
of
it
the
other
side
of
the
street
was
less
crowded
he
crossed
over
and
still
with
the
shuffling
tread
that
dozens
around
him
knew
as
the
characteristic
gait
of
larry
the
bat
but
covering
the
ground
with
amazing
celerity
he
hurried
along
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
the
block
that
cross
street
from
the
bowery
that
led
to
the
sanctuary
how
much
time
had
he
he
turned
the
corner
into
the
darker
cross
street
whitey
mack
would
have
learned
from
bristol
bob
that
larry
the
bat
had
just
been
there
that
is
that
larry
the
bat
was
not
at
the
sanctuary
whitey
mack
would
probably
be
in
no
hurry
he
and
lannigan
might
wait
until
later
until
whitey
mack
should
be
satisfied
that
larry
the
bat
had
gone
home
it
was
the
line
of
least
resistance
they
would
not
attempt
to
scour
the
city
for
him
they
might
even
wait
in
that
private
room
at
bristol
bob
until
they
decided
that
it
was
time
to
sally
out
he
might
perhaps
still
find
them
there
when
he
got
back
at
any
rate
from
there
he
must
pick
up
their
trail
again
on
the
other
hand
all
this
was
but
supposition
they
might
make
at
once
for
the
sanctuary
to
lie
in
wait
for
him
in
any
case
there
was
need
desperate
need
for
haste
he
glanced
sharply
around
him
and
by
the
side
of
the
tenement
house
now
that
bordered
on
the
alleyway
with
a
curious
swift
gliding
motion
he
seemed
to
blend
into
the
shadow
and
darkness
it
was
the
sanctuary
that
room
on
the
first
floor
of
the
tenement
the
tenement
that
had
three
entrances
three
exits
a
passageway
through
to
the
saloon
on
the
next
street
that
abutted
on
the
rear
the
usual
front
door
and
the
side
door
in
the
alleyway
gone
was
the
shuffling
gait
quick
alert
he
ran
crouching
bent
down
along
the
alleyway
reached
the
side
door
opened
it
stealthily
closed
it
behind
him
with
equal
caution
and
in
the
dark
entry
stood
motionless
listening
intently
there
was
no
sound
he
began
to
mount
the
rickety
dilapidated
stairs
and
where
it
seemed
that
the
lightest
tread
must
make
them
creak
out
in
blatant
protest
his
trained
muscles
delicately
compensating
his
body
weight
carried
him
upward
with
a
silence
that
was
almost
uncanny
there
was
need
of
silence
as
there
was
need
of
haste
he
was
not
so
sure
now
of
the
time
at
his
disposal
that
he
had
even
reached
the
sanctuary
first
how
long
had
he
loitered
in
that
way
on
the
bowery
he
did
not
know
perhaps
longer
than
he
had
imagined
there
was
the
possibility
that
whitey
mack
and
lannigan
were
already
above
waiting
for
him
but
even
if
they
were
not
already
there
and
he
got
away
before
they
came
it
was
imperative
that
no
one
should
know
that
larry
the
bat
had
come
and
gone
he
reached
the
landing
and
paused
again
his
right
hand
with
a
vicious
muzzle
of
his
automatic
peeping
now
from
between
his
fingers
thrown
a
little
forward
it
was
black
utterly
black
around
him
again
that
stealthy
catlike
tread
and
his
ear
was
at
the
keyhole
of
the
sanctuary
door
a
full
minute
priceless
though
it
was
passed
then
satisfied
that
the
room
was
empty
he
drew
his
head
back
from
the
keyhole
and
those
slim
tapering
fingers
that
in
their
tips
seemed
to
embody
all
the
human
senses
felt
over
the
lock
apparently
it
had
been
undisturbed
but
that
was
no
proof
that
whitey
mack
had
not
been
there
after
finding
the
metal
case
whitey
mack
was
known
to
be
clever
with
a
lock
clever
enough
for
that
anyhow
he
slipped
in
the
key
turned
it
and
on
hinges
that
were
always
oiled
silently
pushed
the
door
open
and
stepped
across
the
threshold
he
closed
the
door
until
it
was
just
ajar
that
any
sound
might
reach
him
from
without
and
whipping
off
his
coat
began
to
undress
swiftly
there
was
no
light
he
dared
not
use
the
gas
it
might
be
seen
from
the
alleyway
he
was
moving
now
quickly
surely
silently
here
and
there
it
was
like
some
weird
spectre
figure
a
little
blacker
than
the
surrounding
darkness
flitting
about
the
room
the
oilcloth
in
the
corner
was
turned
back
the
loose
flooring
lifted
the
clothes
of
jimmie
dale
taken
out
the
rags
of
larry
the
bat
put
in
the
minutes
flew
by
it
was
not
the
change
of
clothing
that
took
long
it
was
the
eradication
of
larry
the
bat
from
his
face
throat
neck
wrists
and
hands
occasionally
his
head
was
turned
in
a
tense
listening
attitude
but
always
the
fingers
were
busy
working
with
swift
deftness
it
was
done
at
last
larry
the
bat
had
vanished
and
in
his
place
stood
jimmie
dale
the
young
millionaire
the
social
lion
of
new
york
immaculate
in
tweeds
he
stooped
to
the
hole
in
the
flooring
and
his
fingers
going
unerringly
to
their
hiding
place
took
out
a
black
silk
mask
and
an
electric
flashlight
his
automatic
was
already
in
his
possession
his
lips
parted
grimly
who
knew
what
part
a
flashlight
might
not
play
and
he
would
need
the
mask
for
benefit
even
if
it
did
not
disguise
him
from
whitey
mack
had
he
left
any
telltale
evidence
of
his
visit
it
was
almost
worth
the
risk
of
a
light
to
make
sure
he
hesitated
then
shook
his
head
and
stooping
again
carefully
replaced
the
flooring
and
laid
the
oilcloth
over
it
he
dared
not
show
a
light
at
any
cost
but
now
even
more
caution
than
before
was
necessary
at
times
the
lodgers
had
naturally
enough
seen
their
fellow
lodger
larry
the
bat
enter
and
leave
the
tenement
none
had
ever
seen
jimmie
dale
either
leave
or
enter
he
stole
across
the
room
to
the
door
halted
to
assure
himself
that
the
hall
was
empty
slipped
out
into
the
hall
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
again
that
trained
silent
tread
upon
the
stairs
it
seemed
as
though
an
hour
passed
before
he
reached
the
bottom
and
his
brain
was
shrieking
at
him
to
hurry
hurry
hurry
the
entryway
at
last
the
door
the
alleyway
a
long
breath
of
relief
and
he
was
on
the
cross
street
a
step
two
he
took
in
the
direction
of
the
bowery
and
he
was
bending
down
as
though
to
tie
his
shoe
his
automatic
from
his
side
pocket
concealed
in
his
hand
was
that
some
one
there
he
could
have
sworn
he
saw
a
form
start
out
from
behind
the
steps
of
the
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
as
he
had
emerged
from
the
alleyway
in
his
bent
posture
without
seemingly
turning
his
head
his
eyes
swept
sharply
up
and
down
the
other
side
of
the
street
nothing
there
was
not
even
a
pedestrian
in
sight
on
the
block
from
there
to
the
bowery
jimmie
dale
straightened
up
nonchalantly
and
stooped
almost
instantly
again
as
though
the
lace
were
still
proving
refractory
again
that
sharp
searching
glance
again
nothing
he
went
forward
now
in
apparent
unconcern
but
his
right
hand
instead
of
being
buried
in
his
coat
pocket
swung
easily
at
his
side
it
was
strange
his
ineffective
ruse
to
the
contrary
he
was
certain
that
he
had
not
been
mistaken
was
it
whitey
mack
was
the
question
answered
was
the
gray
seal
known
too
as
jimmie
dale
were
they
trailing
him
now
with
the
climax
to
come
at
the
club
at
his
own
palatial
home
wherever
the
surroundings
would
best
lend
themselves
to
assuaging
that
inordinate
thirst
for
the
sensational
that
was
so
essentially
a
characteristic
of
the
confirmed
criminal
what
a
headline
in
the
morning
papers
it
would
make
at
the
corner
he
loitered
by
the
curb
to
light
a
cigarette
still
not
a
soul
in
sight
on
either
side
of
the
street
behind
him
except
a
couple
of
italians
who
had
just
passed
by
strange
again
the
intuition
if
it
were
only
intuition
was
still
strong
he
swung
abruptly
on
his
heel
mingled
with
the
on
the
bowery
walked
a
rapid
half
dozen
steps
until
the
building
hid
the
cross
street
then
ran
across
the
road
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
bowery
and
in
a
crowd
now
came
back
to
the
corner
he
crossed
from
curb
to
curb
slowly
sheltered
by
a
fringe
of
people
that
however
in
no
way
obstructed
his
view
down
the
side
street
and
then
jimmie
dale
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
had
evidently
been
mistaken
after
all
he
was
overexcited
his
nerves
were
raw
that
perhaps
was
the
solution
meanwhile
every
minute
was
counting
if
whitey
mack
and
lannigan
should
still
be
at
bristol
bob
he
kept
on
down
the
bowery
hurrying
with
growing
impatience
through
the
crowds
that
massed
in
front
of
various
places
of
amusement
he
had
not
intended
to
come
along
the
bowery
and
except
for
what
had
occurred
would
have
taken
a
less
frequented
street
he
would
turn
off
at
the
next
block
he
was
in
front
of
that
theatre
again
the
double
life
his
eyes
were
attracted
involuntarily
to
the
lurid
overdone
display
it
seemed
to
threaten
him
it
seemed
to
dangle
before
him
a
premonition
as
it
were
of
what
the
morning
held
in
store
but
now
too
it
seemed
to
feed
into
flame
that
smouldering
fury
that
possessed
him
his
life
or
whitey
mack
men
women
and
the
children
who
turned
night
into
day
in
that
quarter
of
the
city
were
clustered
thick
around
the
signs
hiving
like
bees
to
the
bald
sensationalism
almost
savagely
he
began
to
force
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
the
next
instant
like
a
man
stunned
had
stopped
in
his
tracks
his
fingers
had
closed
in
a
fierce
spasmodic
clutch
over
an
envelope
that
had
been
thrust
suddenly
into
his
hand
jimmie
from
somewhere
came
a
low
quick
voice
jimmie
it
is
eleven
now
he
whirled
scanning
wildly
this
face
then
that
it
was
her
voice
her
voice
the
tocsin
the
sensitive
fingers
were
telegraphing
to
his
brain
as
they
always
did
that
the
texture
of
the
envelope
too
was
hers
her
voice
yes
anywhere
out
of
a
thousand
voices
he
would
distinguish
hers
but
her
face
he
had
never
seen
that
which
out
of
all
the
crowd
around
him
was
hers
surely
he
could
tell
her
by
her
dress
she
would
be
different
her
personality
alone
must
single
her
out
she
say
have
youse
got
de
pip
or
do
youse
youse
owns
de
earth
a
man
flung
at
him
heaving
and
pushing
to
get
by
with
a
start
though
he
scarcely
heard
the
man
jimmie
dale
moved
on
his
brain
was
afire
all
the
irony
of
the
world
seemed
massed
in
a
sudden
overwhelming
attack
upon
him
it
was
useless
intuitively
he
had
known
it
was
useless
from
the
instant
he
had
heard
her
voice
it
was
always
the
same
always
for
years
she
had
eluded
him
like
that
come
upon
him
without
warning
and
disappeared
but
leaving
always
that
tangible
proof
of
her
existence
a
letter
the
call
of
the
gray
seal
to
arms
but
it
was
as
it
had
never
been
before
it
was
not
alone
baffled
chagrin
now
not
alone
the
longing
the
wild
desire
to
see
her
face
to
look
into
her
eyes
it
was
life
and
death
she
had
come
at
the
very
moment
when
she
perhaps
alone
of
all
the
world
could
have
pointed
the
way
out
when
life
liberty
everything
that
was
common
to
them
both
was
at
stake
in
deadly
peril
and
she
had
gone
ignorant
of
it
all
leaving
him
staggered
by
the
very
possibility
of
the
succour
that
was
held
up
before
his
eyes
only
to
be
snatched
away
without
power
of
his
to
grasp
it
his
intuition
had
not
been
at
fault
he
had
made
no
mistake
in
that
shadow
across
the
street
from
the
sanctuary
it
had
been
the
tocsin
he
had
been
followed
and
it
was
she
who
had
followed
him
until
in
a
crowd
she
had
seized
the
opportunity
of
a
moment
ago
though
ultimately
perhaps
it
changed
nothing
it
was
a
relief
in
a
way
to
know
that
it
was
she
not
whitey
mack
who
had
been
lurking
there
but
her
persistent
incomprehensible
determination
to
preserve
the
mystery
with
which
she
surrounded
herself
was
like
now
to
cost
them
both
a
ghastly
price
if
he
could
only
have
had
one
word
with
her
just
one
word
the
letter
in
his
hand
crackled
under
his
clenched
fist
he
stared
at
it
in
a
way
the
call
of
the
gray
seal
to
arms
another
coup
with
its
incident
danger
and
peril
that
she
had
planned
for
him
to
execute
he
could
have
laughed
aloud
at
the
inhuman
mockery
of
it
the
call
of
the
gray
seal
to
arms
now
when
with
every
faculty
drained
to
its
last
resource
cornered
trapped
he
was
fighting
for
his
very
existence
jimmie
it
is
eleven
now
hurry
the
words
were
jangling
discordantly
in
his
brain
and
now
he
laughed
outright
mirthlessly
a
young
girl
hanging
on
her
escort
arm
passing
glanced
at
him
and
giggled
it
was
a
different
jimmie
dale
for
the
moment
for
once
his
immobility
had
forsaken
him
he
laughed
again
a
sort
of
unnatural
desperate
indifference
to
everything
falling
upon
him
what
did
it
matter
the
moment
or
two
it
would
take
to
read
the
letter
he
looked
around
him
he
was
on
the
corner
in
front
of
the
palace
saloon
and
turning
abruptly
he
stepped
in
through
the
swinging
doors
as
larry
the
bat
he
knew
the
place
well
at
the
rear
of
the
barroom
and
along
the
side
of
the
wall
were
some
half
dozen
little
stalls
partitioned
off
from
each
other
several
of
these
were
unoccupied
and
he
chose
the
one
farthest
from
the
entrance
it
was
private
enough
no
one
would
disturb
him
from
the
aproned
individual
who
presented
himself
he
ordered
a
drink
the
man
returned
in
a
moment
and
jimmie
dale
tossed
a
coin
on
the
table
bidding
the
other
keep
the
change
he
wanted
no
drink
the
transaction
was
wholly
perfunctory
the
waiter
was
gone
he
pushed
the
glass
away
from
him
and
tore
the
envelope
open
a
single
sheet
closely
written
on
both
sides
of
the
paper
was
in
his
hand
it
was
her
writing
there
was
no
mistaking
that
but
every
word
every
line
bore
evidence
of
frantic
haste
even
that
customary
formula
dear
philanthropic
crook
that
had
prefaced
every
line
she
had
ever
written
him
before
had
been
omitted
his
eyes
traversed
the
first
few
lines
with
that
strange
indifference
that
had
settled
upon
him
what
after
all
did
it
matter
what
it
was
he
could
do
nothing
not
even
save
himself
probably
and
then
with
a
little
start
he
read
the
lines
over
again
muttering
snatches
from
them

in

of

it
brought
a
sudden
thrill
of
excitement
to
jimmie
dale
that
impossible
as
he
would
have
believed
it
an
instant
ago
for
the
moment
overshadowed
the
realisation
of
his
own
peril
a
robbery
such
as
that
if
it
were
ever
accomplished
would
stir
the
country
from
end
to
end
it
would
set
new
york
by
the
ears
it
would
loose
the
police
in
full
cry
like
a
pack
of
bloodhounds
with
their
leashes
slipped
the
society
columns
of
the
newspapers
had
been
busy
for
months
featuring
the
coming
marriage
of
the
daughter
to
one
of
the
country
young
merchant
princes
the
combined
fortunes
of
the
two
families
would
make
the
young
couple
the
richest
in
america
the
prospective
groom
wedding
gift
was
to
be
a
diamond
necklace
of
perfectly
matched
large
stones
that
would
eclipse
anything
of
the
kind
in
the
country
europe
the
foreign
markets
had
been
literally
combed
and
ransacked
to
supply
the
gems
the
stones
had
arrived
in
new
york
the
day
before
the
duty
on
them
alone
amounting
to
over
fifty
thousand
dollars
all
this
had
appeared
in
the
papers
jimmie
dale
brows
drew
together
in
a
frown
on
just
exactly
what
percentage
the
duty
was
figured
he
did
not
know
but
it
was
high
enough
on
the
basis
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
assume
safely
that
the
assessed
value
of
the
stones
was
not
less
than
four
times
that
amount
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
laid
down
a
quarter
of
a
million
well
why
not
in
more
than
one
quarter
diamonds
were
ranked
as
the
soundest
kind
of
an
investment
furthermore
through
personal
acquaintance
with
the
high
contracting
parties
who
were
in
his
own
set
he
knew
it
to
be
true
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
papers
too
had
thrown
the
limelight
on
max
diestricht
who
though
for
quite
a
time
the
fashion
in
the
social
world
had
up
to
the
present
been
comparatively
unknown
to
the
average
new
yorker
his
own
knowledge
of
max
diestricht
went
deeper
than
the
superficial
biography
furnished
by
the
newspapers
the
old
hollander
had
done
more
than
one
piece
of
exquisite
jewelry
work
for
him
the
old
fellow
was
a
character
that
beggared
description
eccentric
to
the
point
of
extravagance
and
deaf
as
a
post
but
in
craftmanship
a
modern
cellini
he
employed
no
workmen
lived
alone
over
his
shop
on
one
of
the
lower
streets
between
fifth
and
sixth
avenues
near
washington
square
and
possessed
a
splendid
contempt
for
such
protective
contrivances
as
safes
and
vaults
if
his
prospective
patrons
expostulated
on
this
score
before
intrusting
him
with
their
valuables
they
were
at
liberty
to
take
their
work
elsewhere
it
was
max
diestricht
who
honoured
you
by
accepting
the
commission
not
you
who
honoured
max
diestricht
by
intrusting
him
with
it
of
what
use
is
it
to
me
a
safe
he
would
exclaim
it
hides
nothing
it
only
says
am
inside
do
not
look
farther
come
and
get
me
yes
it
is
to
explode
with
the
pouf
and
i
am
deaf
and
i
hear
nothing
it
is
a
foolishness
that
he
had
a
habit
of
prodding
at
one
with
a
levelled
every
night
somewhere
they
are
robbed
and
have
i
been
robbed
hein
tell
me
that
have
i
been
robbed
it
was
true
in
ten
years
though
at
times
having
stones
and
precious
metal
aggregating
large
amounts
deposited
with
him
by
his
customers
max
diestricht
had
never
lost
so
much
as
the
gold
filings
there
was
a
queer
smile
on
jimmie
dale
lips
now
the
knot
in
the
tenth
board
was
significant
max
diestricht
was
scrupulously
honest
a
genius
in
originality
and
conception
of
design
a
master
in
the
perfection
and
delicacy
of
his
finished
work
he
had
been
commissioned
to
design
and
set
the
necklace
the
brain
works
quickly
all
this
and
more
had
flashed
almost
instantaneously
through
jimmie
dale
mind
his
eyes
fell
to
the
letter
again
and
he
read
on
halfway
through
a
sudden
whiteness
blanched
his
face
and
following
it
a
surging
tide
of
red
that
mounted
to
his
temples
it
dazed
him
it
seemed
to
rob
him
for
the
moment
of
the
power
of
coherent
thought
he
was
wrong
he
had
not
read
aright
it
was
incredible
beyond
belief
and
yet
in
its
very
audacity
lay
success
he
finished
the
letter
read
it
once
more
and
his
fingers
mechanically
began
to
tear
it
into
little
shreds
his
brain
was
in
a
whirl
a
vortex
of
conflicting
emotions
had
whitey
mack
and
lannigan
left
bristol
bob
yet
where
were
they
now
was
there
time
for
this
he
was
staring
at
the
little
torn
scraps
of
paper
in
his
hand
he
thrust
them
suddenly
into
his
pocket
and
jerked
out
his
watch
it
was
nearly
midnight
the
broad
muscular
shoulders
seemed
to
square
back
curiously
the
jaws
to
clamp
a
little
the
face
to
harden
and
grow
cold
until
it
was
like
stone
with
a
swift
movement
he
emptied
his
glass
into
the
cuspidor
set
the
glass
back
on
the
table
and
stepped
out
from
the
stall
his
destination
was
max
diestricht
the
palace
saloon
was
near
the
upper
end
of
the
bowery
and
failing
a
taxicab
of
which
none
was
in
sight
his
quickest
method
was
to
walk
and
he
started
briskly
forward
it
was
not
far
and
it
was
barely
ten
minutes
from
the
time
he
had
left
the
palace
saloon
when
he
swung
through
washington
square
to
fifth
avenue
and
a
moment
later
turned
from
that
thoroughfare
heading
west
toward
sixth
avenue
along
one
of
those
streets
which
with
the
city
northward
trend
had
quite
lost
any
distinctive
identity
and
from
being
once
a
modestly
fashionable
residential
section
had
now
become
a
conglomerate
potpourri
of
small
tradesmen
stores
shops
and
apartments
of
the
poorer
class
he
knew
max
diestricht
he
could
well
have
done
without
the
aid
of
the
arc
lamp
which
even
if
dimly
indicated
that
low
almost
structure
tucked
away
between
the
taller
buildings
on
either
side
that
almost
engulfed
it
it
was
late
the
street
was
quiet
the
shops
and
stores
had
long
since
been
closed
max
diestricht
among
them
the
old
hollanders
name
in
painted
white
letters
stood
out
against
the
background
of
a
darkened
workshop
window
in
the
story
above
the
lights
too
were
out
max
diestricht
was
probably
fast
asleep
and
he
was
stone
deaf
a
glance
up
and
down
the
street
and
jimmie
dale
was
standing
or
rather
leaning
against
max
diestricht
door
there
was
no
one
to
see
and
if
there
were
what
was
there
to
attract
attention
to
a
man
standing
nonchalantly
for
a
moment
in
a
doorway
it
was
only
for
a
moment
those
master
fingers
of
jimmie
dale
were
working
surely
swiftly
silently
a
little
steel
instrument
that
was
never
out
of
his
possession
was
in
the
lock
and
out
again
the
door
opened
closed
he
drew
the
black
silk
mask
from
his
pocket
and
slipped
it
over
his
face
immediately
in
front
of
him
the
stairs
led
upward
immediately
to
his
right
was
the
door
into
the
shop
the
modest
street
entrance
was
common
to
both
the
door
into
the
workshop
was
not
locked
he
opened
it
stepped
inside
and
closed
it
quietly
behind
him
the
place
was
in
blackness
he
stood
for
a
moment
silent
straining
his
ears
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
reconstructing
the
plan
of
his
surroundings
in
his
mind
as
he
remembered
it
it
was
a
narrow
oblong
room
running
the
entire
depth
of
the
building
a
very
long
room
blank
walls
on
either
side
a
window
in
the
middle
of
the
rear
wall
that
gave
on
a
back
yard
and
from
the
back
yard
there
was
access
to
the
lane
also
as
he
remembered
the
place
it
was
a
riot
of
disorder
with
workbenches
and
odds
and
ends
strewn
without
system
or
reason
in
every
direction
one
had
need
of
care
to
negotiate
it
in
the
dark
he
took
his
flashlight
from
his
pocket
and
preliminary
to
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
interior
glanced
out
through
the
front
window
near
which
he
stood
and
with
a
suppressed
cry
shrank
back
instinctively
against
the
wall
two
men
were
crossing
the
street
heading
directly
for
the
shop
door
the
arc
lamp
lighted
up
their
faces
it
was
inspector
lannigan
of
headquarters
and
whitey
mack
the
quick
intake
of
jimmie
dale
breath
was
sucked
through
clenched
teeth
they
were
close
on
his
heels
then
far
closer
than
he
had
imagined
it
would
take
whitey
mack
scarcely
any
longer
to
open
that
front
door
than
it
had
taken
him
close
on
his
heels
his
face
was
rigid
he
could
hear
them
now
at
the
door
the
flashlight
in
his
hand
winked
down
the
length
of
the
room
if
was
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
but
it
was
still
more
dangerous
to
stumble
into
some
object
and
make
a
noise
he
darted
forward
circuiting
a
workbench
a
stool
a
small
hand
forge
again
the
flashlight
gleamed
against
the
side
wall
near
the
rear
was
another
workbench
with
a
sort
of
coarse
canvas
curtain
hanging
part
way
down
in
front
of
it
evidently
to
protect
such
things
as
might
be
stored
away
beneath
it
from
dust
and
jimmie
dale
sprang
for
it
whipped
back
the
canvas
and
crawled
underneath
he
was
not
an
instant
too
soon
as
the
canvas
fell
back
into
place
the
shop
door
opened
closed
and
the
two
men
had
stepped
inside
whitey
mack
voice
in
a
low
whisper
though
it
was
seemed
to
echo
raucously
through
the
shop
mabbe
we
have
a
sweet
wait
but
i
got
the
straight
dope
on
this
he
going
to
make
a
try
for
dutchy
sparklers
we
let
him
go
the
limit
and
we
do
either
of
us
make
a
move
till
he
pinched
them
and
then
we
get
him
with
the
goods
on
him
he
ca
get
away
he
has
a
hope
there
only
two
ways
of
getting
in
here
or
getting
out
this
door
and
window
here
and
a
window
that
down
there
at
the
back
you
guard
this
and
i
take
care
of
the
other
end
savvy
right
lannigan
answered
grimly
go
ahead
there
was
the
sound
of
footsteps
moving
forward
then
a
vicious
bump
the
scraping
of
some
object
along
the
floor
and
a
muffled
curse
from
whitey
mack
use
your
flashlight
advised
the
inspector
in
a
guarded
voice
i
have
got
one
damn
it
growled
whitey
mack
it
all
right
i
get
again
the
steps
but
more
warily
now
as
though
the
man
were
cautiously
feeling
ahead
of
him
for
possible
obstacles
jimmie
dale
for
a
moment
held
his
breath
he
could
have
reached
out
and
touched
the
man
as
the
other
passed
whitey
mack
went
on
until
he
had
taken
up
a
position
against
the
rear
wall
jimmie
dale
heard
him
as
he
brushed
against
it
then
silence
fell
he
was
between
them
now
stretched
full
length
on
the
floor
jimmie
dale
raised
the
lower
portion
of
the
canvas
away
from
in
front
of
his
face
he
could
see
nothing
the
place
was
in
stygian
blackness
but
it
had
been
close
and
stifling
and
at
least
it
gave
him
more
air
the
minutes
dragged
by
each
more
interminable
than
the
one
that
had
gone
before
not
a
movement
not
a
sound
and
then
through
the
stillness
very
faint
at
first
came
the
regular
repressed
breathing
of
whitey
mack
who
was
much
the
nearer
of
the
two
men
and
once
noticeable
almost
imperceptible
as
it
was
it
seemed
to
pervade
the
room
and
fill
it
with
a
strange
ominous
resonance
that
rose
and
fell
until
the
blackness
palpitated
with
it
slowly
very
slowly
jimmie
dale
hand
crept
into
his
pocket
and
crept
out
again
with
his
automatic
he
lay
motionless
once
more
time
in
any
concrete
sense
ceased
to
exist
fancied
shapes
began
to
assume
form
in
the
darkness
by
the
door
lannigan
stirred
uneasily
shifting
his
position
slightly
was
it
hours
was
it
only
minutes
it
seemed
to
ring
through
the
stillness
like
the
shriek
of
a
hurtling
shell
and
it
was
only
a
whisper
watch
yourself
lannigan
whispered
whitey
mack
he
coming
now
through
the
yard
do
move
till
i
start
something
let
him
get
his
paws
on
the
silence
again
and
then
a
low
rasping
at
the
window
like
the
gnawing
of
a
rat
then
inch
by
inch
the
sash
was
lifted
there
was
the
sound
as
of
a
body
forcing
its
way
over
the
sill
cautiously
then
a
step
upon
the
floor
inside
another
and
still
another
the
figure
of
a
man
loomed
up
suddenly
against
the
glow
of
a
flashlight
as
he
threw
the
round
white
ray
inquisitively
here
and
there
over
the
rear
wall
and
now
he
appeared
to
be
counting
the
boards
one
two
three
ten
his
hand
ran
up
and
down
the
tenth
board
again
and
again
he
repeated
the
operation
and
something
like
the
snarl
of
a
baited
beast
echoed
through
the
room
he
half
turned
to
snatch
at
something
in
his
pocket
and
the
light
for
a
moment
showed
a
lowering
face
partially
hidden
by
a
peaked
cap
that
was
pulled
far
down
over
his
eyes
there
was
the
rip
and
tear
of
rending
wood
as
a
steel
jimmy
in
lieu
of
the
spring
the
man
evidently
could
not
find
bit
in
between
the
boards
a
muttered
oath
of
satisfaction
and
a
portion
of
the
wall
slid
back
disclosing
what
looked
like
a
cupboard
he
reached
in
seized
one
of
a
dozen
little
boxes
and
wrenched
off
the
cover
a
blue
scintillating
gleam
seemed
to
leap
out
to
meet
the
white
ray
of
the
flashlight
the
man
chuckled
hoarsely
and
began
to
cram
the
rest
of
the
boxes
into
his
pockets
jimmie
dale
stirred
on
hands
and
knees
he
was
creeping
now
from
beneath
the
workbench
something
caught
and
tore
behind
him
the
canvas
curtain
and
at
the
sound
with
a
sharp
cry
the
man
at
the
wall
whirled
the
light
went
out
and
he
sprang
toward
the
window
jimmie
dale
gained
his
feet
and
leaped
forward
a
revolver
shot
cut
a
lane
of
fire
through
the
blackness
and
above
the
roar
of
the
report
whitey
mack
voice
in
a
fierce
yell
it
all
right
lannigan
i
got
him
no
hell
there
was
a
terrific
crash
of
breaking
glass
he
got
away
not
yet
he
has
gritted
jimmie
dale
between
his
teeth
and
his
clubbed
revolver
swung
crashing
to
the
head
of
a
dark
form
in
front
of
him
there
was
a
half
sigh
half
moan
the
form
slid
limply
to
the
floor
lannigan
was
floundering
down
the
shop
leaping
obstacles
in
a
mad
rush
his
flashlight
picking
out
the
way
jimmie
dale
stepped
swiftly
backward
and
his
hand
groped
out
for
the
droplight
over
the
end
of
the
bench
that
he
had
knocked
against
in
his
own
rush
his
fingers
clutched
it
and
the
lower
end
of
the
shop
was
flooded
with
light
except
for
his
felt
hat
that
lay
a
little
distance
away
there
was
no
sign
of
whitey
mack
the
huddled
form
of
the
man
who
but
a
moment
since
had
chuckled
as
he
pocketed
old
max
gems
lay
sprawled
inert
upon
the
floor
and
lannigan
was
staring
into
the
muzzle
of
jimmie
dale
automatic
drop
that
gun
lannigan
said
jimmie
dale
coolly
and
i
trouble
you
not
to
make
a
noise
it
might
attract
attention
from
the
street
there
been
too
much
already
drop
that
gun
the
revolver
clattered
from
lannigan
hand
to
the
floor
a
step
forward
and
jimmie
dale
toe
sent
it
spinning
under
a
bench
another
step
and
his
revolver
still
covering
the
other
he
had
whipped
a
pair
of
handcuffs
from
the
officer
side
pocket
lannigan
as
though
the
thought
had
never
occurred
to
him
offered
no
resistance
he
was
staring
in
a
dazed
sort
of
way
back
and
forth
from
jimmie
dale
to
the
man
on
the
floor
what
this
mean
he
burst
out
suddenly
where
your
wrist
please
requested
jimmie
dale
pleasantly
no
the
left
one
thank
you
as
the
handcuff
snapped
shut
now
go
over
there
and
sit
down
on
the
floor
beside
that
fellow
quick
jimmie
dale
voice
rasped
suddenly
imperatively
still
bewildered
but
a
little
sullen
now
lannigan
obeyed
jimmie
dale
stooped
quickly
and
snapped
the
other
link
of
the
handcuff
over
the
unconscious
man
right
wrist
jimmie
dale
smiled
that
the
approved
way
of
taking
your
man
is
it
left
wrist
to
the
prisoner
right
he
only
stunned
he
be
around
in
a
moment
know
him
lannigan
shook
his
head
take
a
good
look
at
him
invited
jimmie
dale
you
ought
to
know
most
of
them
in
the
lannigan
bent
over
a
little
closer
and
then
with
an
amazed
cry
his
free
hand
shot
forward
and
tore
away
the
other
beard
it
was
whitey
mack
my
god
gasped
lannigan
quite
so
said
jimmie
dale
evenly
you
find
the
diamonds
in
his
pockets
and
excuse
me
his
fingers
were
running
through
whitey
clothes
ah
here
it
is
the
thin
metal
case
was
in
his
hand
a
little
article
that
belongs
to
me
and
whose
loss
i
am
free
to
admit
caused
me
considerable
concern
until
i
was
informed
that
he
had
only
found
it
without
having
the
slightest
idea
as
to
whom
it
belonged
it
made
quite
a
difference
he
had
opened
the
case
carelessly
before
lannigan
eyes
gray
seal
i
say
it
for
you
said
jimmie
dale
whimsically
this
is
what
probably
put
the
idea
into
his
head
after
first
in
some
way
having
discovered
old
max
diestricht
hiding
place
and
if
i
had
given
him
time
enough
he
would
probably
have
stuck
one
of
these
seals
in
clumsy
imitation
of
that
little
eccentricity
of
mine
on
the
wall
over
there
to
stamp
the
job
as
genuine
you
begin
to
get
it
do
you
lannigan
pretty
as
an
alibi
eh
and
have
got
away
with
it
too
as
far
as
you
were
concerned
he
had
only
to
fire
that
shot
smash
the
window
tuck
his
false
beard
mustache
and
peaked
cap
into
his
pocket
put
on
his
own
hat
that
you
see
there
on
the
floor
and
yell
that
the
man
had
escaped
he
help
you
chase
the
thief
too
rather
neat
do
you
think
lannigan
and
worth
the
risk
too
considering
the
howl
that
would
go
up
at
the
theft
of
those
stones
and
that
known
as
the
slickest
diamond
thief
in
the
country
he
would
be
the
first
to
be
suspected
except
that
the
police
themselves
in
the
person
of
inspector
lannigan
of
headquarters
would
be
prepared
to
prove
a
perfectly
good
alibi
for
lannigan
head
was
thrust
forward
his
eyes
hard
were
riveted
on
whitey
mack
my
god
he
said
again
under
his
breath
then
fiercely
he
get
his
for
this
it
was
a
moment
before
jimmie
dale
spoke
he
was
musingly
examining
the
automatic
in
his
hand
i
am
going
now
lannigan
he
observed
quietly
i
require
say
fifteen
minutes
in
which
to
effect
my
escape
it
is
of
course
obvious
that
an
alarm
raised
by
you
might
prove
extremely
awkward
but
a
piece
of
canvas
from
that
bench
there
together
with
a
bit
of
string
would
make
a
most
effective
gag
i
prefer
however
not
to
submit
you
to
that
indignity
instead
i
offer
you
the
alternative
of
giving
me
your
word
to
remain
quietly
where
you
are
for
fifteen
lannigan
hesitated
jimmie
dale
smiled
i
agree
said
lannigan
shortly
jimmie
dale
stepped
back
the
switch
clicked
the
place
was
in
darkness
there
was
a
moment
two
of
utter
stillness
then
softly
from
the
front
end
of
the
shop
a
whisper
if
i
were
you
lannigan
i
take
that
gun
from
whitey
pocket
before
he
comes
round
and
beats
you
to
and
the
door
had
closed
silently
behind
jimmie
dale
chapter
xi
the
in
the
subway
ten
minutes
before
a
messenger
boy
had
squeezed
himself
into
a
seat
beside
jimmie
dale
yanked
a
dime
novel
from
a
refractory
pocket
and
blissfully
lost
to
all
the
world
had
buried
his
head
in
its
pages
jimmie
dale
glance
at
the
youngster
had
equally
perforce
embraced
the
lurid
title
of
the
thriller
dicing
with
death
so
imperturbably
thrust
under
his
nose
at
the
time
he
had
smiled
indulgently
but
now
as
he
left
the
subway
and
headed
for
his
home
on
riverside
drive
the
words
not
only
refused
to
be
ignored
but
had
resolved
themselves
into
a
curiously
persistent
refrain
in
his
mind
they
were
exactly
what
they
purported
to
be
of
the
deepest
hue
of
yellow
melodramatic
in
the
extreme
but
also
to
him
now
they
were
grimly
apt
and
premonitorily
appropriate
dicing
with
death
there
was
not
an
hour
not
a
moment
in
the
day
when
he
was
not
literally
dicing
with
death
when
with
the
underworld
and
the
police
allied
against
him
a
single
false
move
would
lose
him
the
throw
that
left
death
the
winner
the
risk
of
the
dual
life
enforced
upon
him
grew
daily
greater
and
in
the
end
there
must
be
the
reckoning
he
would
have
been
a
madman
to
have
shut
his
eyes
in
the
face
of
what
was
obvious
but
it
was
worth
it
all
and
in
his
soul
he
knew
that
he
would
not
have
had
it
otherwise
even
now
the
day
after
would
come
another
letter
from
the
tocsin
and
there
would
be
another
crime
of
the
gray
blazoned
in
the
press
would
that
be
the
last
affair
or
would
there
be
another
or
the
day
after
would
he
be
trapped
before
even
one
more
letter
came
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
ran
up
the
steps
of
his
house
those
were
the
stakes
that
he
himself
had
laid
on
the
table
to
wager
upon
the
game
he
had
no
quarrel
there
but
if
only
before
the
end
came
or
even
with
the
end
itself
he
could
find
her
with
his
latchkey
he
let
himself
into
the
spacious
richly
furnished
reception
hall
and
crossing
this
went
up
the
broad
staircase
his
steps
noiseless
on
the
heavy
carpet
below
faintly
he
could
hear
some
of
the
servants
they
evidently
had
not
heard
him
close
the
door
behind
him
discipline
was
relaxed
somewhat
it
was
quite
apparent
with
jason
that
peer
of
butlers
away
jason
poor
chap
was
in
the
hospital
typhoid
they
had
thought
it
at
first
though
it
had
turned
out
to
be
some
milder
form
of
infection
he
would
be
back
in
a
few
days
now
but
meanwhile
he
missed
the
old
man
sorely
from
the
house
he
reached
the
landing
and
turning
went
along
the
hall
to
the
door
of
his
own
particular
den
opened
the
door
closed
it
behind
him
and
in
an
instant
the
keen
agile
brain
trained
to
the
little
things
that
never
escaped
it
that
daily
held
his
life
in
the
balance
was
alert
the
room
was
unusually
dark
even
for
it
was
as
though
the
window
shades
had
been
closely
drawn
a
thing
jason
never
did
but
then
jason
was
there
jimmie
dale
smiling
then
a
little
quizzically
at
himself
reached
up
for
the
switch
beside
the
door
pressed
it
and
his
finger
still
on
the
button
whipped
his
automatic
from
his
pocket
with
his
other
hand
the
room
was
still
in
darkness
the
smile
on
jimmie
dale
lips
was
gone
for
his
lips
now
had
closed
together
in
a
tight
drawn
line
the
lights
in
the
rest
of
the
house
as
witness
the
reception
hall
were
in
order
this
was
no
accident
silent
motionless
he
stood
there
listening
was
he
trapped
at
last
in
his
own
house
by
whom
the
police
the
thugs
of
the
underworld
it
made
little
difference
the
end
would
differ
only
in
the
method
by
which
it
was
attained
what
was
that
was
there
a
slight
stir
a
movement
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
or
was
it
his
imagination
his
hand
fell
from
the
switch
to
the
doorknob
behind
his
back
slowly
without
a
sound
it
began
to
turn
under
his
slim
tapering
fingers
whose
deft
sensitive
touch
had
made
him
known
and
feared
as
the
master
cracksman
of
them
all
and
as
noiselessly
the
door
began
to
open
it
was
like
a
duel
a
duel
of
silence
what
was
the
intruder
whoever
he
might
be
waiting
for
the
abortive
click
of
the
switch
to
say
nothing
of
the
opening
of
the
door
when
he
had
entered
was
evidence
enough
that
he
was
there
was
the
other
trying
to
place
him
exactly
through
the
darkness
to
make
sure
of
his
attack
the
door
was
open
now
and
suddenly
jimmie
dale
laughed
easily
aloud
and
on
the
instant
shifted
his
position
well
inquired
jimmie
dale
coolly
from
the
other
side
of
the
threshold
it
seemed
like
a
sigh
fluttering
through
the
room
a
gasp
of
relief
and
then
the
blood
was
pounding
madly
at
his
temples
and
he
was
back
in
the
room
again
the
door
closed
once
more
behind
him
oh
jimmie
why
did
you
speak
i
had
to
be
sure
that
it
was
it
was
her
voice
hers
the
tocsin
here
she
was
here
here
in
his
house
you
he
cried
you
here
he
was
pressing
the
switch
frantically
again
and
again
her
voice
came
out
of
the
darkness
from
across
the
room
why
are
you
doing
that
jimmie
you
know
already
that
i
have
turned
off
the
at
the
sockets
of
course
he
laughed
out
the
words
almost
hysterically
your
face
i
have
never
seen
your
face
you
he
was
moving
quickly
toward
the
reading
lamp
on
his
desk
there
was
a
quick
hurried
swish
of
garments
and
she
was
blocking
his
way
no
she
said
in
a
low
voice
you
must
not
light
that
he
laughed
again
shortly
fiercely
now
she
was
close
to
him
his
hands
reached
out
for
her
touched
her
and
thrilling
at
the
touch
swept
her
toward
him
jimmie
jimmie
are
you
mad
she
breathed
mad
yes
he
was
mad
with
the
wildest
most
passionate
exhilaration
he
had
ever
known
he
found
his
voice
with
an
effort
these
months
and
years
that
i
have
tried
until
my
soul
was
sick
to
find
you
he
cried
out
and
you
are
here
now
your
face
i
must
see
your
face
she
had
wrenched
herself
away
from
him
he
could
hear
her
breath
coming
sharply
in
little
gasps
he
groped
his
way
onward
toward
the
desk
wait
her
tones
seemed
to
ring
suddenly
vibrant
through
the
room
wait
before
you
touch
that
lamp
i
i
put
you
on
your
honour
not
to
light
he
stopped
abruptly
my
honour
he
repeated
mechanically
yes
i
came
here
because
there
was
no
other
way
no
other
way
do
you
understand
i
came
trusting
to
your
honour
not
to
take
advantage
of
the
conditions
that
forced
me
to
do
this
i
had
no
fear
that
i
was
wrong
i
have
no
fear
now
you
will
not
light
that
lamp
and
you
will
not
make
any
attempt
to
prevent
my
going
away
as
i
came
unknown
is
there
any
question
about
it
jimmie
i
am
in
your
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
he
burst
out
wildly
i
risked
my
life
for
a
chance
like
this
again
and
again
i
gone
through
hell
living
in
squalour
for
a
month
on
end
as
larry
the
bat
in
the
hope
that
i
might
discover
who
you
are
and
do
you
think
i
let
anything
stop
me
now
i
tell
you
no
a
thousand
times
no
she
made
no
answer
there
was
only
her
low
quick
breathing
coming
from
somewhere
near
him
he
made
another
step
toward
the
lamp
and
stopped
i
tell
you
no
he
said
again
and
took
another
step
forward
and
stopped
once
more
still
she
made
no
answer
a
minute
passed
another
his
hand
lifted
and
swept
across
his
forehead
in
an
agitated
way
still
silence
she
neither
moved
nor
spoke
his
hand
dropped
slowly
to
his
side
there
was
a
queer
twisted
smile
upon
his
lips
you
win
he
said
hoarsely
thank
you
jimmie
she
said
simply
and
your
name
who
you
are
he
was
speaking
but
he
did
not
seem
to
recognise
his
own
voice
the
hundred
other
things
i
sworn
i
make
you
explain
when
i
found
you
are
all
taboo
as
well
i
suppose
yes
she
said
he
laughed
bitterly
do
you
know
he
cried
out
that
between
the
police
and
the
underworld
our
house
of
cards
is
likely
to
collapse
at
any
minute
that
they
are
hunting
the
gray
seal
day
and
night
is
it
to
be
always
like
this
that
i
am
never
to
know
until
it
is
too
late
she
came
toward
him
out
of
the
darkness
impulsively
they
will
never
get
you
jimmie
she
said
in
a
suppressed
voice
and
some
day
i
promise
you
now
you
shall
have
your
reward
for
you
shall
know
when
the
word
came
from
him
with
fierce
eagerness
i
do
not
know
she
answered
gently
soon
perhaps
perhaps
sooner
than
either
of
us
and
by
that
you
mean
what
he
asked
and
his
hand
reached
out
for
her
again
through
the
blackness
this
time
she
did
not
draw
away
there
was
an
instant
hesitation
then
she
spoke
again
hurriedly
a
note
of
anxiety
in
her
voice
you
are
beginning
all
over
again
are
you
jimmie
and
i
have
told
you
that
i
can
explain
nothing
and
besides
it
is
what
has
brought
me
here
that
counts
now
and
every
moment
is
of
yes
i
know
he
interposed
but
then
at
least
you
will
tell
me
one
thing
why
did
you
come
instead
of
sending
me
a
letter
as
you
always
have
before
because
it
is
different
than
it
ever
was
before
she
replied
earnestly
because
there
is
something
in
what
has
happened
that
i
can
not
explain
myself
because
there
is
danger
and
where
i
could
not
see
clearly
i
feared
a
trap
and
so
i
dared
not
send
what
in
a
letter
could
at
best
be
only
vague
and
incomplete
details
do
you
see
yes
said
jimmie
dale
but
he
was
only
listening
in
an
abstracted
way
if
he
could
only
see
that
face
so
close
to
his
he
had
yearned
for
that
with
all
his
soul
for
years
now
and
she
was
here
standing
beside
him
and
his
hand
was
upon
her
arm
and
here
in
his
own
den
in
his
own
house
he
was
listening
to
another
call
to
arms
for
the
gray
seal
from
her
own
lips
honour
was
he
but
a
poor
quixotic
fool
he
had
only
to
step
to
the
desk
and
switch
on
the
light
why
should
he
steadied
himself
with
a
jerk
and
drew
away
his
hand
she
was
in
his
house
go
on
he
said
tersely
do
you
know
or
did
you
ever
hear
of
old
luther
doyle
she
asked
no
said
jimmie
dale
do
you
know
a
man
then
named
connie
myers
connie
myers
who
in
the
bad
lands
did
not
know
connie
myers
who
boasted
of
the
half
dozen
prison
sentences
already
to
his
credit
yes
he
knew
connie
myers
but
strangely
enough
it
was
not
in
the
bad
lands
or
as
larry
the
bat
that
he
knew
the
man
or
that
the
other
knew
him
it
was
as
jimmie
dale
connie
myers
had
introduced
himself
one
night
several
years
ago
with
a
blackjack
that
had
just
missed
its
mark
as
the
man
had
jumped
out
from
a
dark
alleyway
on
the
east
side
and
he
jimmie
dale
had
thrashed
the
other
to
within
an
inch
of
his
life
he
had
reason
to
know
connie
myers
and
connie
myers
had
reason
to
remember
him
yes
he
said
with
a
grim
smile
i
know
connie
and
the
tenement
across
the
street
from
where
you
live
as
larry
the
bat
that
of
course
you
he
leaned
toward
her
wonderingly
now
of
course
he
ejaculated
naturally
listen
then
jimmie
she
was
speaking
quickly
now
it
is
a
strange
story
this
luther
doyle
was
already
over
fifty
when
some
eight
or
nine
years
ago
his
parents
died
within
a
few
months
of
each
other
and
he
inherited
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
but
the
man
though
harmless
enough
was
mildly
insane
queer
and
the
old
couple
on
account
of
their
son
mental
defects
took
care
to
leave
the
money
securely
invested
and
so
that
he
could
only
touch
the
interest
during
these
eight
or
nine
years
he
has
lived
by
himself
in
the
same
old
family
house
where
he
had
lived
with
his
parents
in
a
lonely
spot
near
pelham
and
he
has
lived
in
a
most
frugal
even
miserly
manner
his
income
could
not
have
been
less
than
six
thousand
dollars
a
year
and
his
expenditures
could
not
have
been
more
than
six
hundred
his
dementia
ironically
enough
from
the
day
that
he
came
into
his
fortune
took
the
form
of
a
most
pitiable
and
abject
fear
that
he
would
die
in
poverty
misery
and
want
and
so
year
after
year
cashing
his
checks
as
fast
as
he
got
them
never
trusting
the
bank
with
a
penny
he
kept
hiding
away
somewhere
in
his
house
every
cent
he
could
scrape
and
save
from
his
income
which
must
amount
at
a
minimum
calculation
to
fifty
thousand
and
observed
jimmie
dale
quietly
connie
myers
robbed
him
of
it
and
no
her
voice
was
quivering
with
passion
as
she
caught
up
his
words
twice
in
the
last
month
connie
myers
tried
to
rob
him
but
the
money
was
too
securely
hidden
twice
he
broke
into
doyle
house
when
the
old
man
was
out
but
on
both
occasions
was
unsuccessful
in
his
search
and
was
interrupted
and
forced
to
make
his
escape
on
account
of
return
an
hour
ago
in
an
empty
room
on
the
second
floor
of
that
tenement
in
the
room
facing
the
landing
old
luther
doyle
was
murdered
there
was
silence
for
an
instant
her
hand
had
closed
in
a
tight
pressure
on
his
arm
the
darkness
seemed
to
add
a
sort
of
ghastly
significance
to
her
words
in
god
name
how
do
you
know
all
this
he
demanded
wildly
how
do
you
know
all
these
things
does
that
matter
now
she
answered
tensely
you
will
know
that
when
you
know
the
rest
oh
do
you
understand
jimmie
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
now
it
was
easy
to
lure
a
creature
like
that
anywhere
it
was
connie
myers
who
lured
him
to
the
tenement
and
murdered
him
there
but
from
that
point
jimmie
i
am
not
sure
of
our
ground
i
do
not
know
whether
connie
myers
is
alone
in
this
or
not
but
i
do
know
that
he
is
going
to
doyle
house
again
to
make
another
search
for
the
money
there
is
no
question
but
that
old
doyle
was
murdered
to
give
connie
myers
and
his
accomplices
if
there
are
any
a
chance
to
tear
the
house
inside
out
to
find
the
money
to
give
them
the
whole
night
to
work
in
without
interruption
if
necessary
but
doyle
dead
in
his
own
house
could
have
interfered
no
more
with
them
than
doyle
dead
in
that
tenement
why
was
he
lured
to
the
tenement
by
connie
myers
when
he
could
much
more
easily
have
been
put
out
of
the
way
in
his
own
house
jimmie
there
is
something
behind
this
something
more
that
you
must
find
out
there
may
be
others
in
this
besides
connie
myers
i
do
not
know
but
there
is
something
here
that
i
am
afraid
of
jimmie
you
must
get
that
man
you
must
get
the
others
if
there
are
others
and
you
must
stop
them
from
getting
the
money
in
that
house
do
you
understand
now
why
i
have
come
here
i
could
not
explain
in
a
letter
i
do
not
quite
seem
to
be
explaining
now
it
would
seem
as
though
there
were
no
need
for
the
gray
seal
that
simply
the
police
should
be
notified
but
i
know
jimmie
call
it
intuition
what
you
will
i
know
that
there
is
need
for
us
for
you
that
behind
all
this
is
a
tragedy
deeper
blacker
than
even
the
brutal
murder
that
is
already
her
voice
in
its
passionate
earnestness
died
away
and
an
anger
cold
grim
remorseless
settled
upon
jimmie
dale
settled
as
it
always
settled
upon
him
at
her
call
to
arms
his
brain
was
already
at
work
in
its
quick
instant
way
probing
sifting
planning
she
was
right
it
was
strange
it
was
more
than
strange
that
with
the
added
risk
the
danger
the
difficulty
the
man
should
have
been
brought
miles
to
be
done
away
with
in
that
tenement
why
connie
myers
took
form
before
him
the
coarse
features
the
tawny
hair
that
straggled
across
the
low
forehead
the
shifty
eyes
that
were
an
indeterminate
colour
between
brown
and
gray
the
thin
lips
that
seemed
to
draw
in
and
give
the
jaw
a
protruding
belligerent
effect
and
connie
myers
knew
him
as
jimmie
dale
it
would
have
to
be
then
as
larry
the
bat
that
the
gray
seal
must
work
that
meant
time
to
go
to
the
sanctuary
and
change
the
police
he
asked
suddenly
aloud
they
have
not
yet
discovered
the
body
not
yet
she
replied
hurriedly
and
that
is
still
another
reason
for
haste
there
is
no
telling
when
they
will
see
here
she
thrust
a
paper
into
his
hand
here
is
a
plan
of
old
doyle
house
and
directions
for
finding
it
you
must
get
connie
myers
you
must
make
him
convict
himself
for
the
evidence
through
which
i
know
him
to
be
guilty
can
never
be
used
against
him
and
jimmie
be
careful
i
know
i
am
not
wrong
that
there
is
still
something
more
behind
all
this
and
now
go
jimmie
go
there
is
no
time
to
lose
she
was
pushing
him
across
the
room
toward
the
door
go
the
word
seemed
suddenly
to
bring
dismay
it
was
she
again
who
was
dominant
now
in
his
mind
who
knew
if
when
he
was
taking
his
life
in
his
hands
again
would
not
be
the
last
and
she
was
here
now
here
beside
him
where
she
might
never
be
again
she
seemed
to
divine
his
thoughts
for
she
spoke
again
a
strange
new
note
of
tenderness
in
her
voice
that
thrilled
him
you
must
never
let
them
get
you
jimmie
for
my
sake
it
will
not
last
much
longer
it
is
near
the
end
and
i
shall
keep
my
promise
but
go
now
jimmie
go
go
he
repeated
numbly
go
but
but
you
i
she
slipped
suddenly
away
from
him
retreating
back
down
the
room
i
will
go
as
i
wait
listen
he
pleaded
there
was
no
answer
she
was
there
somewhere
back
there
in
the
darkness
still
he
stood
hesitant
at
the
door
it
seemed
that
every
faculty
he
possessed
urged
him
back
there
again
to
her
could
he
let
her
escape
him
now
when
she
was
so
utterly
in
his
power
she
who
meant
everything
in
his
life
and
then
like
a
cold
shock
came
that
other
thought
she
who
had
trusted
to
his
honour
with
a
jerk
his
hand
swept
out
felt
for
the
doorknob
and
closed
upon
it
he
said
heavily
and
stepped
out
into
the
hall
it
seemed
for
a
while
even
after
he
had
gained
the
street
and
made
his
way
again
to
the
subway
that
nothing
was
concrete
around
him
that
he
was
living
through
some
fantastical
dream
his
head
whirled
and
he
could
not
think
rationally
and
then
slowly
little
by
little
his
grip
upon
himself
came
back
she
had
come
and
gone
with
the
roar
of
the
subway
in
his
ears
its
raucous
note
seeming
to
strike
so
perfectly
in
consonance
with
the
turmoil
within
him
he
smiled
mirthlessly
after
all
it
was
as
it
always
was
she
was
gone
and
ahead
of
him
lay
the
chances
of
the
night
dicing
with
death
the
words
unbidden
came
back
once
more
if
they
were
true
before
they
were
doubly
applicable
now
it
was
different
from
what
it
had
ever
been
before
as
she
had
said
usually
to
the
smallest
detail
everything
was
laid
open
clear
before
him
in
those
astounding
letters
it
was
vague
at
best
a
man
had
been
murdered
connie
myers
had
committed
the
murder
under
circumstances
that
pointed
strongly
to
some
hidden
motive
behind
and
beyond
the
mere
chance
it
afforded
him
to
search
his
victim
house
for
the
hidden
cash
what
was
it
jimmie
dale
stared
out
at
the
black
subway
walls
the
answer
would
not
come
station
after
station
passed
at
fourteenth
street
he
changed
from
the
express
to
a
local
got
out
at
astor
place
and
a
few
minutes
later
was
walking
rapidly
down
the
upper
end
of
the
bowery
the
answer
would
not
come
only
the
fact
itself
grew
more
and
more
deeply
significant
the
ghastly
callous
fiendishness
that
lured
an
old
man
to
his
death
had
jimmie
dale
in
that
grip
of
cold
merciless
anger
again
and
there
was
a
dull
flush
now
upon
his
cheeks
whatever
it
meant
whatever
was
behind
it
one
thing
at
least
was
certain
he
would
get
connie
myers
he
was
close
to
the
sanctuary
now
it
was
down
the
next
cross
street
he
reached
the
corner
and
turned
it
heading
east
but
his
brisk
walk
had
changed
to
a
nonchalant
saunter
there
were
some
people
coming
toward
him
it
was
the
gray
seal
now
alert
and
cautious
the
little
group
passed
by
ahead
the
tenement
bordering
on
the
black
alleyway
loomed
up
the
sanctuary
with
its
three
entrances
and
exits
the
home
of
larry
the
bat
and
across
from
it
was
that
other
tenement
that
held
a
new
interest
for
him
now
where
in
an
empty
room
on
the
second
floor
she
had
said
old
doyle
still
lay
should
he
go
there
he
was
thinking
quickly
now
and
shook
his
head
it
would
take
what
he
did
not
have
to
spare
time
it
was
already
ten
and
granted
that
connie
myers
had
committed
the
crime
only
a
little
over
an
hour
ago
the
man
by
this
time
would
certainly
be
on
his
way
to
doyle
house
near
pelham
if
indeed
he
were
not
already
there
no
there
was
no
time
to
spare
the
question
resolved
itself
simply
into
how
long
since
he
had
already
searched
twice
and
failed
on
both
occasions
it
would
take
connie
myers
to
unearth
old
doyle
hiding
place
for
the
money
jimmie
dale
glanced
sharply
around
him
slipped
into
the
alleyway
and
crouching
against
the
tenement
wall
moved
noiselessly
along
to
the
side
entrance
a
moment
more
and
he
had
negotiated
the
rickety
stairs
with
practiced
soundless
tread
was
inside
the
squalid
quarters
of
larry
the
bat
and
the
door
of
the
sanctuary
was
locked
and
bolted
behind
him
perhaps
five
minutes
passed
and
then
where
jimmie
dale
the
millionaire
had
entered
there
emerged
larry
the
bat
of
the
aristocracy
and
the
elite
of
the
bad
lands
but
instead
of
leaving
by
the
side
door
and
the
alleyway
as
he
had
entered
he
went
along
the
lower
hallway
to
the
front
entrance
and
here
instinctively
he
paused
a
moment
at
the
top
of
the
steps
as
his
eyes
rested
upon
the
tenement
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
it
was
strange
that
the
crime
should
have
been
committed
there
something
again
seemed
to
draw
him
toward
that
empty
room
on
the
second
story
he
had
decided
once
that
he
would
not
go
that
there
was
not
time
but
after
all
it
would
not
take
long
and
there
was
at
least
the
possibility
of
gaining
something
more
valuable
even
than
time
from
the
scene
of
the
crime
itself
there
might
even
be
the
evidence
he
wanted
there
that
would
disclose
the
whole
of
connie
myers
game
he
went
down
the
steps
and
started
across
the
street
but
halfway
over
he
hesitated
uncertainly
as
a
child
cry
came
petulantly
from
the
doorway
it
was
dark
in
the
street
and
likewise
it
was
one
of
those
hot
suffocating
evenings
when
in
the
crowded
tenements
of
the
poorer
class
miserable
enough
in
any
case
misery
was
added
to
a
hundredfold
for
lack
of
a
single
breath
of
air
these
two
facts
apparently
irrelevant
caused
jimmie
dale
to
change
his
mind
again
he
had
not
noticed
the
woman
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
sitting
on
the
doorstep
but
now
as
he
reached
the
curb
he
not
only
saw
but
recognised
her
and
he
swung
on
down
the
street
toward
the
bowery
he
could
not
very
well
go
in
without
passing
her
without
being
recognised
himself
and
that
was
a
needless
risk
he
smiled
a
little
wanly
once
the
crime
was
discovered
she
would
not
have
hesitated
long
before
informing
the
police
that
she
had
seen
him
enter
there
hagan
was
no
friend
of
his
one
could
not
live
as
he
had
lived
as
larry
the
bat
and
not
see
something
in
an
intimate
way
of
the
pitiful
little
tragedies
of
the
poor
around
him
for
bad
tough
and
dissolute
as
the
quarter
was
all
were
not
degraded
there
some
were
simply
poor
hagan
was
poor
her
husband
was
a
day
labourer
often
out
of
a
job
and
sometimes
he
drank
that
was
how
he
jimmie
dale
or
rather
larry
the
bat
had
come
to
earn
hagan
enmity
he
had
found
mike
hagan
drunk
one
night
and
in
the
act
of
being
arrested
and
had
wheedled
the
man
away
from
the
officer
on
the
promise
that
he
would
take
hagan
home
and
he
was
larry
the
bat
a
dope
fiend
a
character
known
to
all
the
neighbourhood
and
hagan
had
laid
her
condition
to
his
influence
and
companionship
he
had
taken
mike
hagan
home
and
hagan
had
driven
larry
the
bat
from
the
door
of
her
miserable
lodging
in
that
tenement
with
the
bitter
words
on
her
tongue
that
only
a
woman
can
use
when
shame
and
grief
and
anger
are
breaking
her
heart
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
back
along
the
bowery
he
retraced
his
steps
but
now
with
the
hurried
shuffle
of
larry
the
bat
where
before
had
been
the
brisk
athletic
stride
of
jimmie
dale
at
astor
place
again
he
took
the
subway
this
time
to
the
grand
central
station
and
well
within
an
hour
from
the
time
he
had
left
the
sanctuary
including
the
train
journey
to
pelham
he
was
standing
in
a
clump
of
trees
that
fringed
a
deserted
roadway
he
had
passed
but
few
houses
once
he
was
away
from
pelham
and
as
well
as
he
could
judge
there
was
none
now
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
him
except
this
one
of
old
luther
doyle
that
showed
up
black
and
shadowy
just
beyond
the
trees
jimmie
dale
eyes
narrowed
as
he
surveyed
the
place
it
was
little
wonder
that
known
to
have
money
an
attempt
to
rob
old
doyle
should
have
been
made
in
a
place
like
this
it
was
even
more
grimly
significant
than
ever
of
some
deeper
meaning
that
in
its
loneliness
an
ideal
place
for
a
murder
the
man
should
have
been
lured
from
there
for
that
purpose
to
a
crowded
tenement
in
the
city
instead
what
did
it
mean
why
had
it
been
done
he
shook
his
head
the
answer
would
not
come
now
any
more
than
it
had
come
before
in
the
subway
or
in
the
train
on
the
way
out
when
he
had
set
his
brain
so
futilely
to
solve
the
problem
from
a
survey
of
the
house
jimmie
dale
gave
attention
to
the
details
of
his
surroundings
the
trees
on
either
side
the
open
space
in
front
a
distance
of
fifty
yards
to
the
road
the
absence
of
any
fence
and
then
abruptly
he
stole
forward
there
was
no
light
to
be
seen
anywhere
about
the
house
was
it
possible
that
connie
myers
was
not
yet
there
he
shook
his
head
again
impatiently
connie
myers
would
not
have
wasted
any
time
as
the
tocsin
had
said
there
was
always
present
the
possibility
that
the
crime
in
that
tenement
might
be
discovered
at
any
moment
connie
myers
would
have
lost
no
time
for
let
the
discovery
be
made
let
the
police
identify
the
body
as
they
most
certainly
would
and
they
would
be
out
here
hotfoot
jimmie
dale
stood
suddenly
still
what
did
it
mean
he
had
not
thought
of
that
before
if
old
doyle
had
been
murdered
here
there
would
not
have
been
even
the
possibility
of
discovery
until
the
morning
at
the
earliest
and
connie
myers
would
have
had
all
the
time
he
wanted
what
was
that
sound
a
low
muffled
tapping
like
a
succession
of
hammer
blows
came
from
within
the
house
jimmie
dale
darted
forward
reached
the
side
of
the
house
and
dropped
on
hands
and
knees
one
question
at
least
was
answered
connie
myers
was
inside
the
plan
that
she
had
given
him
showed
an
cellarway
closed
by
folding
trapdoors
that
was
located
a
little
toward
the
rear
and
in
a
moment
creeping
along
he
came
upon
it
his
hands
felt
over
it
it
was
shut
fastened
by
a
padlock
on
the
outside
jimmie
lips
thinned
a
little
as
he
took
a
small
steel
instrument
from
his
pocket
either
through
inadvertence
or
by
intention
connie
myers
had
passed
up
an
almost
childishly
simple
means
of
entrance
into
the
house
one
side
of
the
trapdoor
was
lifted
up
silently
and
silently
closed
jimmie
dale
was
in
the
cellar
the
hammering
much
more
distinct
now
heavy
thudding
blows
came
from
a
room
in
the
front
the
connection
between
the
cellar
and
the
house
as
shown
on
the
tocsin
plan
was
through
another
trapdoor
in
the
floor
of
the
kitchen
jimmie
dale
flashlight
played
on
a
short
ladderlike
stairway
and
in
an
instant
he
was
climbing
upward
the
sounds
from
the
front
of
the
house
continued
now
without
interruption
there
was
little
fear
that
connie
myers
would
hear
anything
else
even
the
protesting
squeak
of
the
hinges
as
jimmie
dale
cautiously
pushed
back
the
trapdoor
in
the
flooring
above
his
head
an
inch
two
inches
he
lifted
it
and
his
eyes
on
a
level
with
the
opening
now
he
peered
into
the
room
the
kitchen
itself
was
intensely
dark
but
through
an
open
doorway
well
to
one
side
so
that
he
could
not
see
into
the
room
beyond
there
struggled
a
curiously
faint
dim
glimmer
of
light
and
then
jimmie
dale
form
straightened
rigidly
on
the
stairs
the
blows
stopped
and
a
voice
in
a
low
growl
presumably
connie
myers
reached
him
here
take
a
drive
at
it
from
the
lower
edge
there
was
no
answer
save
that
the
blows
were
resumed
again
jimmie
dale
face
had
set
hard
connie
myers
was
not
alone
in
this
then
well
the
odds
were
a
little
heavier
doubled
that
was
all
he
pushed
the
trapdoor
wide
open
swung
himself
up
through
the
opening
to
the
floor
and
the
next
instant
back
a
little
from
the
connecting
doorway
his
body
pressed
closely
against
the
kitchen
wall
he
was
staring
bewildered
and
amazed
into
the
next
room
on
the
floor
presumably
to
lessen
the
chance
of
any
light
rays
stealing
through
the
tightly
drawn
window
shades
burned
a
small
oil
lamp
the
place
was
in
utter
confusion
the
side
of
a
large
fireplace
made
of
rough
untrimmed
stone
and
cement
and
which
occupied
almost
the
entire
end
of
the
room
was
already
practically
demolished
and
the
wreckage
was
littered
everywhere
part
of
the
furniture
was
piled
unceremoniously
into
one
corner
out
of
the
way
and
at
the
fireplace
itself
working
with
sledge
and
bar
were
two
men
one
was
connie
myers
an
ironical
glint
crept
into
jimmie
dale
eyes
the
false
beard
and
mustache
the
man
wore
would
deceive
no
one
who
knew
connie
myers
and
that
he
should
be
wearing
them
now
as
he
knelt
holding
the
bar
while
the
other
struck
at
it
seemed
both
uncalled
for
and
absurd
the
other
man
heavily
built
roughly
dressed
had
his
back
turned
and
jimmie
dale
could
not
see
his
face
the
puzzled
frown
on
jimmie
dale
forehead
deepened
somewhere
in
the
masonry
of
the
fireplace
of
course
was
where
old
luther
doyle
had
hidden
his
money
that
was
quite
plain
enough
and
that
connie
myers
in
some
way
or
other
had
made
sure
of
that
fact
was
equally
obvious
but
how
did
old
luther
doyle
get
his
money
in
there
from
time
to
time
as
he
received
the
interest
and
dividends
whose
accumulation
according
to
the
tocsin
comprised
his
hoard
and
how
did
he
get
it
out
again
all
right
that
do
grunted
connie
myers
suddenly
we
can
pry
this
one
out
now
lend
a
hand
on
the
bar
the
other
dropped
his
sledge
turned
sideways
as
he
stooped
to
help
connie
myers
his
face
came
into
view
and
with
an
involuntary
start
jimmie
dale
crouched
farther
back
against
the
wall
as
he
stared
at
the
other
it
was
hagan
hagan
husband
mike
hagan
my
god
whispered
jimmie
dale
under
his
breath
so
that
was
it
that
the
murder
had
been
committed
in
the
tenement
was
not
so
strange
now
a
surge
of
anger
swept
jimmie
dale
and
was
engulfed
in
a
wave
of
pity
somehow
the
thin
tired
face
of
hagan
had
risen
before
him
and
she
seemed
to
be
pleading
with
him
to
go
away
to
leave
the
house
to
forget
that
he
had
ever
been
there
to
forget
what
he
had
seen
what
he
was
seeing
now
his
hands
clenched
fiercely
how
realistically
how
importunately
how
pitifully
she
took
form
before
him
she
was
on
her
knees
clasping
his
knees
imploring
him
terrified
from
jimmie
dale
pocket
came
the
black
silk
mask
slowly
almost
hesitantly
he
fitted
it
over
his
face
mike
hagan
knew
larry
the
bat
why
should
he
have
pity
for
mike
hagan
had
he
any
for
connie
myers
what
right
had
he
to
let
pity
sway
him
the
man
had
gone
the
limit
he
was
connie
myers
accomplice
a
murderer
but
the
man
was
not
a
hardened
confirmed
criminal
like
connie
myers
mike
hagan
a
murderer
it
would
have
been
unbelievable
but
for
the
evidence
before
his
own
eyes
now
the
man
had
faults
brawled
enough
and
drank
enough
to
have
brought
him
several
times
to
the
notice
of
the
police
but
this
jimmie
dale
eyes
had
never
left
the
scene
before
him
both
men
were
throwing
their
weight
upon
the
bar
and
the
stone
that
they
were
trying
to
dislodge
they
were
into
the
heart
of
the
masonry
now
seemed
to
move
a
little
connie
myers
stood
up
and
leaning
forward
examined
the
stone
critically
at
top
and
bottom
prodding
it
with
the
bar
he
turned
from
his
examination
abruptly
and
thrust
the
bar
into
hagan
hands
hold
it
he
said
tersely
i
strike
for
a
crouched
on
his
hands
and
knees
hagan
inserted
the
point
of
the
bar
into
the
crevice
connie
myers
picked
up
the
sledge
lower
bend
lower
he
snapped
and
swung
the
sledge
it
seemed
to
go
black
for
a
moment
before
jimmie
dale
eyes
seemed
to
paralyse
all
action
of
mind
and
body
there
was
a
low
cry
that
was
more
a
moan
the
clang
of
the
iron
bar
clattering
on
the
floor
and
mike
hagan
had
pitched
forward
on
his
face
an
inert
and
huddled
heap
a
half
laugh
half
snarl
purled
from
connie
myers
lips
as
he
snatched
a
stout
piece
of
cord
from
his
pocket
and
swiftly
knotted
the
unconscious
wrists
together
another
instant
and
picking
up
the
bar
prying
with
it
again
the
loosened
stone
toppled
with
a
crash
into
the
grate
it
had
come
sudden
as
the
crack
of
doom
that
blow
too
quick
too
unexpected
for
jimmie
dale
to
have
lifted
a
finger
to
prevent
it
and
now
that
the
first
numbed
shock
of
mingled
horror
and
amazement
was
past
he
fought
back
the
quick
fierce
impulse
to
spring
out
on
connie
myers
whether
the
man
was
killed
or
only
stunned
he
could
do
no
good
to
mike
hagan
now
and
there
was
connie
myers
he
was
staring
in
a
fascinated
way
at
connie
myers
behind
the
stone
that
the
other
had
just
dislodged
was
a
large
hollow
space
that
had
been
left
in
the
masonry
and
from
this
now
connie
myers
was
eagerly
collecting
handfuls
of
banknotes
that
were
rolled
up
into
the
shape
of
little
cylinders
each
one
grotesquely
tied
with
a
string
the
man
was
feverishly
excited
muttering
to
himself
running
from
the
fireplace
to
where
the
table
had
been
pushed
aside
with
the
rest
of
the
furniture
dropping
the
curious
little
rolls
of
money
on
the
table
and
running
back
for
more
and
then
having
apparently
emptied
the
receptacle
he
wriggled
his
body
over
the
dismantled
fireplace
stuck
his
head
into
the
opening
and
peered
upward
kinks
in
his
nut
kinks
in
his
nut
connie
myers
was
muttering
drop
the
bar
through
from
the
top
mabbe
there
some
got
stuck
in
the
he
regained
his
feet
picked
up
the
bar
and
ran
with
it
into
what
was
evidently
the
front
hall
then
his
steps
sounded
running
upstairs
like
a
flash
jimmie
dale
was
across
the
room
and
at
the
fireplace
like
connie
myers
he
too
put
his
head
into
the
opening
and
then
a
queer
unpleasant
smile
on
his
lips
he
bent
quickly
over
the
man
on
the
floor
hagan
was
no
more
than
stunned
and
was
even
then
beginning
to
show
signs
of
returning
consciousness
there
was
a
rattle
a
clang
a
thud
and
the
bar
too
long
to
come
all
the
way
through
dropped
into
the
opening
and
stood
upright
connie
myers
footsteps
sounded
again
returning
on
the
run
and
jimmie
dale
was
back
once
more
on
the
other
side
of
the
kitchen
doorway
it
was
all
simple
enough
once
one
understood
the
same
queer
smile
was
still
flickering
on
jimmie
dale
lips
there
was
no
way
to
get
the
money
out
except
the
way
connie
myers
had
got
it
out
by
digging
it
out
with
the
irrational
cunning
of
his
mad
brain
that
had
put
the
money
even
beyond
his
own
reach
old
doyle
had
built
his
fireplace
with
a
hollow
some
eighteen
inches
square
in
a
great
wall
of
solid
stonework
and
from
it
had
run
a
pipe
up
somewhere
to
the
story
above
and
down
this
pipe
he
had
dropped
his
little
cylinders
of
banknotes
satisfied
that
his
hoard
was
safe
there
seemed
something
pitifully
ironic
in
the
elaborate
insane
craftiness
of
the
old
demented
mind
and
now
connie
myers
was
back
in
the
room
again
and
again
a
puzzled
expression
settled
upon
jimmie
dale
face
as
he
watched
the
other
for
perhaps
a
minute
the
man
stood
by
the
table
sifting
the
little
rolls
of
money
through
his
fingers
gloatingly
then
impulsively
he
pushed
these
to
one
side
produced
a
revolver
laid
it
on
the
table
and
from
another
pocket
took
out
a
little
case
which
as
he
opened
it
jimmie
dale
could
see
contained
a
hypodermic
syringe
one
more
article
followed
the
other
two
a
letter
which
connie
myers
took
out
of
an
unsealed
envelope
he
dropped
this
suddenly
on
the
table
as
mike
hagan
three
feet
away
on
the
floor
groaned
and
sat
up
hagan
eyes
swept
bewildered
confused
around
him
questioningly
at
connie
myers
and
then
resting
suddenly
on
his
bound
wrists
they
narrowed
menacingly
damn
you
you
smashed
me
with
that
sledge
on
purpose
he
burst
out
and
began
to
struggle
to
his
feet
with
a
brutal
chuckle
connie
myers
pushed
hagan
back
and
shoved
his
revolver
under
the
other
nose
sure
he
admitted
evenly
and
you
keep
quiet
or
i
finish
you
now
instead
of
letting
the
police
do
it
he
laughed
out
jarringly
you
under
arrest
you
know
for
the
murder
of
luther
doyle
and
for
robbing
the
poor
old
nut
of
his
savings
in
his
house
hagan
wrenched
himself
up
on
his
elbow
what
what
do
you
mean
he
stammered
oh
do
worry
said
connie
myers
maliciously
i
not
making
the
arrest
i
rather
the
police
did
that
i
not
mixing
up
in
it
and
by
and
by
he
lifted
up
the
hypodermic
for
hagan
to
see
i
going
to
shoot
a
little
dope
into
you
that
keep
you
quiet
while
i
get
away
hagan
face
had
gone
a
grayish
white
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
money
on
the
table
and
his
eyes
kept
shifting
back
and
forth
from
it
to
myers
face
murder
he
said
huskily
there
is
no
murder
i
do
know
who
doyle
is
you
said
this
house
was
yours
you
hired
me
to
come
here
you
said
you
were
going
to
tear
down
the
fireplace
and
build
another
you
said
i
could
work
evenings
and
earn
some
extra
sure
i
did
there
was
a
vicious
leer
now
on
connie
myers
lips
but
you
do
think
i
picked
you
out
by
accident
do
you
your
reputation
my
bucko
was
just
shady
enough
to
satisfy
anybody
that
it
would
be
beyond
you
to
go
the
limit
sure
you
murdered
doyle
listen
to
he
took
up
the
letter
to
the
police
luther
doyle
was
murdered
this
evening
in
the
tenement
at
street
you
find
his
body
in
a
room
on
the
second
floor
if
you
want
to
know
who
did
it
look
in
mike
hagan
room
on
the
floor
above
there
a
paper
stuck
under
the
edge
of
hagan
table
with
a
piece
of
chewing
gum
where
he
hid
it
you
know
what
it
is
when
you
go
out
and
take
a
look
at
doyle
house
in
pelham
yours
truly
a
mike
hagan
did
not
speak
his
lips
were
twitching
and
there
was
horror
creeping
into
his
eyes
d
get
me
sneered
connie
myers
tell
your
story
who
believe
it
i
got
you
cinched
twice
i
tried
to
get
this
old
dub
coin
out
here
and
could
find
it
but
the
second
time
i
found
something
else
a
piece
of
paper
with
a
drawing
of
the
fireplace
on
it
and
a
place
in
the
drawing
marked
with
an
x
that
was
good
enough
was
it
the
paper
i
stuck
under
your
table
this
afternoon
when
your
wife
was
out
see
somebody
got
to
stand
for
the
job
and
if
it
somebody
else
it
wo
be
me
get
me
when
i
had
a
look
at
that
fireplace
i
knew
i
could
do
the
job
alone
in
a
week
and
i
did
dare
blast
it
with
for
fear
of
spoiling
what
was
inside
and
since
i
had
to
have
somebody
to
help
me
i
thought
i
might
as
well
let
him
help
me
all
the
way
through
and
stand
for
it
i
picked
you
mike
that
why
i
croaked
old
doyle
in
your
tenement
i
wrote
this
letter
while
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
show
up
at
the
station
to
come
out
here
with
me
and
i
going
to
see
that
the
police
get
it
in
the
next
hour
when
they
find
doyle
in
the
room
below
yours
and
that
paper
in
your
room
and
the
busted
fireplace
here
i
guess
they
wo
look
any
farther
for
who
did
it
and
say
he
leaned
forward
with
an
ugly
grin
mabbe
you
think
soft
to
be
telling
you
all
this
but
do
you
fool
yourself
you
know
me
you
do
know
who
i
am
so
tell
the
truth
they
believe
you
anyway
with
evidence
like
that
against
you
and
the
neater
the
story
the
more
they
think
it
shows
brains
enough
on
your
part
to
have
pulled
a
job
like
this
my
god
hagan
was
rocking
on
his
knees
beads
of
sweat
were
starting
out
on
his
forehead
you
would
plant
a
man
like
that
he
cried
brokenly
you
would
do
it
would
you
my
god
you
would
do
that
jimmie
dale
face
under
his
mask
was
white
and
rigid
there
was
something
primal
elemental
in
the
savagery
that
was
sweeping
upon
him
he
had
it
all
now
all
she
had
been
right
there
was
need
for
the
gray
seal
so
that
was
the
game
inhuman
hellish
the
whole
of
it
to
the
last
filthy
dregs
connie
myers
to
protect
himself
was
railroading
an
innocent
man
to
death
for
the
crime
that
he
himself
had
committed
there
was
a
cold
smile
on
jimmie
dale
lips
now
as
he
took
his
automatic
from
his
pocket
no
it
was
quite
all
the
game
there
was
still
his
hand
to
play
he
edged
forward
a
little
nearer
to
the
door
and
halted
abruptly
listening
an
automobile
had
stopped
outside
on
the
road
hagan
was
still
pleading
in
a
frenzied
way
connie
myers
was
callously
folding
his
letter
while
he
watched
the
other
warily
neither
of
the
men
had
heard
the
sound
and
then
quick
almost
on
the
instant
came
a
rush
of
feet
a
crash
upon
the
front
door
an
imperative
command
to
open
in
the
name
of
the
law
the
police
jimmie
dale
brain
was
working
now
with
lightning
speed
somehow
the
police
had
stumbled
upon
the
crime
in
that
tenement
and
as
he
had
foreseen
in
such
an
event
had
identified
doyle
but
they
could
not
be
sure
that
any
one
was
present
here
in
the
house
now
they
could
not
see
a
light
any
more
than
he
had
he
must
get
mike
hagan
away
must
see
that
connie
myers
did
not
get
away
myers
was
on
his
feet
now
fear
struck
in
his
turn
the
letter
clutched
in
a
fist
his
revolver
swung
out
poised
in
the
other
hand
hagan
too
was
on
his
feet
and
unheeded
now
by
connie
myers
was
wrenching
his
wrists
apart
another
crash
upon
the
door
another
another
demand
in
a
harsh
voice
to
open
it
then
some
one
running
around
to
the
window
at
the
side
of
the
house
and
jimmie
dale
sprang
forward
there
was
the
roar
of
a
report
a
blinding
flash
almost
in
jimmie
eyes
as
connie
myers
whirling
instantly
at
his
entrance
fired
and
missed
it
happened
quick
then
in
the
space
of
the
ticking
of
a
watch
before
jimmie
dale
flinging
himself
forward
had
reached
the
man
like
a
defiant
challenge
to
their
demand
it
must
have
seemed
to
the
officers
outside
that
shot
of
connie
myers
at
jimmie
dale
for
it
was
answered
on
the
instant
by
another
through
the
side
window
and
the
shot
fired
at
random
the
interior
of
the
room
hidden
from
the
officers
outside
by
the
drawn
shades
found
its
mark
and
connie
myers
a
bullet
in
his
brain
pitched
forward
dead
upon
the
floor
quick
jimmie
dale
flung
at
hagan
get
that
letter
out
of
his
hand
he
jumped
for
the
lamp
on
the
floor
extinguished
it
and
turned
again
toward
hagan
have
you
got
it
he
whispered
tensely
yes
said
hagan
in
a
numbed
way
this
way
then
jimmie
dale
caught
hagan
arm
and
pulled
the
other
across
the
room
and
into
the
kitchen
to
the
trapdoor
quick
he
breathed
again
get
down
there
quick
and
no
noise
they
do
know
how
many
are
in
the
house
when
they
find
him
they
probably
be
hagan
stupefied
dazed
obeyed
mechanically
and
in
an
instant
the
trapdoor
closed
behind
them
jimmie
dale
was
standing
beside
the
other
in
the
cellar
not
a
sound
now
he
cautioned
once
more
his
flashlight
winked
went
out
winked
again
then
held
steadily
in
curious
fascination
it
seemed
as
in
its
circuit
the
ray
fell
upon
hagan
fell
upon
the
torn
ragged
edge
of
a
paper
in
hagan
hand
with
a
suppressed
cry
jimmie
dale
snatched
it
away
from
the
other
it
was
but
a
torn
half
of
the
letter
the
other
half
the
other
half
hagan
where
is
it
he
demanded
hoarsely
hagan
almost
in
a
state
of
collapse
muttered
inaudibly
the
crash
of
a
toppling
door
sounded
from
above
jimmie
dale
shook
the
man
desperately
where
is
it
he
repeated
fiercely
he
he
was
holding
it
tight
it
it
tore
in
his
hand
hagan
stammered
does
it
make
any
difference
oh
let
get
out
of
here
whoever
you
are
for
god
sake
let
get
out
of
here
any
difference
jimmie
dale
jaws
were
clamped
like
a
steel
vise
any
difference
the
difference
between
life
and
death
for
the
man
beside
him
that
was
all
he
was
reading
the
portion
in
his
hand
it
was
the
last
part
of
the
letter
beginning
with
there
a
paper
stuck
under
the
edge
of
hagan
table
from
above
from
the
floor
of
the
front
room
now
came
the
rush
and
trample
of
feet
he
could
not
go
back
for
the
other
half
and
any
attempt
to
conceal
the
fact
that
connie
myers
had
been
alone
in
the
house
was
futile
now
they
would
find
the
torn
letter
in
the
dead
man
hand
proof
enough
that
some
one
else
had
been
there
what
was
in
that
part
of
the
letter
that
was
still
clutched
in
that
death
grip
upstairs
a
sentence
from
it
that
he
had
heard
connie
myers
read
seemed
to
burn
itself
into
his
brain
if
you
want
to
know
who
did
it
look
in
mike
hagan
room
on
the
floor
and
then
suddenly
like
light
through
the
darkness
came
a
ray
of
hope
he
pulled
hagan
to
the
cellarway
and
stealthily
lifted
one
side
of
the
double
trapdoor
there
was
a
chance
desperate
enough
one
in
a
thousand
but
still
a
chance
voices
from
the
house
came
plainly
now
but
there
was
no
one
in
sight
the
police
to
a
man
were
evidently
all
inside
from
the
road
in
front
showed
the
lamp
glare
of
their
automobile
run
for
the
car
jimmie
dale
jerked
out
from
between
set
teeth
and
with
hagan
beside
him
steadying
the
man
by
the
arm
dashed
across
the
intervening
fifty
yards
they
had
not
been
seen
a
minute
more
and
the
car
evidently
belonging
to
the
local
police
for
it
was
headed
in
the
direction
of
new
york
and
as
though
it
had
come
from
pelham
swept
down
the
road
swept
around
a
turn
and
jimmie
dale
with
a
gasp
of
relief
straightened
up
a
little
from
the
wheel
how
much
time
had
he
the
police
must
have
heard
the
car
but
equally
occupied
as
they
were
they
might
well
give
it
no
thought
other
than
that
it
was
but
another
car
passing
by
there
was
no
telephone
in
the
house
the
nearest
house
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
and
that
might
or
might
not
have
a
telephone
could
he
count
on
half
an
hour
he
glanced
anxiously
at
the
crouched
figure
beside
him
he
would
have
to
it
was
the
only
chance
they
would
telephone
the
contents
of
the
dead
half
of
the
letter
to
the
new
york
police
could
he
get
to
hagan
room
first
look
in
hagan
room
their
part
of
the
letter
read
but
it
did
not
say
for
what
or
exactly
where
if
they
found
nothing
hagan
was
safe
connie
myers
reputation
the
fact
that
he
was
found
in
disguise
at
doyle
house
was
barring
any
incriminating
evidence
quite
enough
to
let
hagan
out
there
would
only
remain
in
the
minds
of
the
police
the
question
of
who
beside
connie
myers
had
been
in
old
doyle
house
that
night
and
now
jimmie
dale
smiled
a
little
whimsically
well
perhaps
he
could
answer
that
and
if
not
quite
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
police
at
least
to
the
complete
vindication
of
mike
hagan
but
he
could
not
drive
through
towns
and
villages
with
a
mask
on
his
face
and
there
ahead
now
lights
were
beginning
to
show
and
more
than
ever
now
with
what
was
before
him
it
was
imperative
that
mike
hagan
should
not
recognise
larry
the
bat
jimmie
dale
glanced
again
at
hagan
and
slowed
down
the
car
they
were
on
the
outskirts
of
a
town
and
off
to
the
right
he
caught
the
twinkling
lights
of
a
street
car
hagan
he
said
sharply
pull
yourself
together
and
listen
to
me
if
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
you
nothing
to
fear
if
you
let
out
a
word
of
what
happened
you
probably
go
to
the
chair
for
a
crime
you
know
nothing
about
do
you
understand
keep
your
mouth
shut
the
car
had
stopped
hagan
nodded
his
head
all
right
then
you
get
out
here
and
take
a
street
car
into
new
york
continued
jimmie
dale
crisply
but
when
you
get
there
keep
away
from
your
home
for
the
next
two
or
three
hours
hang
around
with
some
of
the
boys
you
know
and
if
you
asked
anything
afterward
say
you
were
batting
around
town
all
evening
do
worry
you
find
you
out
of
this
when
you
read
the
morning
papers
now
get
out
hurry
he
pushed
hagan
from
the
car
i
got
to
make
my
own
hagan
standing
in
the
road
brushed
his
hand
bewilderingly
across
his
eyes
yes
but
you
i
never
mind
about
that
jimmie
dale
leaned
out
and
gripped
arm
impressively
there
only
one
thing
you
got
to
think
of
or
remember
keep
your
mouth
shut
no
matter
what
happens
keep
your
mouth
shut
if
you
want
to
save
your
neck
hagan
the
car
was
racing
forward
again
it
shot
streaking
through
the
streets
of
the
town
ahead
and
dully
over
its
own
inferno
echoed
shouts
cries
and
execrations
of
an
outraged
populace
then
out
into
the
night
again
roaring
its
way
toward
new
york
he
had
half
an
hour
perhaps
it
was
a
good
thing
hagan
did
not
know
or
had
not
grasped
the
significance
of
that
torn
letter
the
man
would
have
been
unmanageable
with
fear
and
excitement
it
would
puzzle
hagan
to
find
no
paper
stuck
under
his
table
when
he
came
to
look
for
it
but
that
was
a
minor
consideration
that
mattered
not
at
all
half
an
hour
on
roared
the
car
towns
black
roads
villages
wooded
lands
were
kaleidoscopic
in
their
passing
half
an
hour
had
he
done
it
had
he
come
anywhere
near
doing
it
he
did
not
know
he
was
in
the
city
at
last
and
now
he
had
to
moderate
his
speed
but
by
keeping
to
the
less
frequented
streets
he
could
still
drive
at
a
fast
pace
one
piece
of
good
fortune
had
been
his
the
long
motor
coat
he
had
found
in
the
car
with
which
to
cover
the
rags
of
larry
the
bat
and
without
which
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
leave
the
car
somewhere
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
to
trust
like
mike
hagan
to
other
and
slower
means
of
transportation
blocks
away
from
hagan
tenement
he
ran
the
car
into
a
lane
slipped
off
the
motor
coat
and
from
his
pocket
whipped
out
the
little
metal
insignia
case
and
in
another
moment
a
gray
seal
was
neatly
affixed
to
the
black
ebony
rim
of
the
steering
wheel
he
smiled
ironically
it
was
necessary
quite
necessary
that
the
police
should
have
no
doubt
as
to
who
had
been
in
doyle
house
with
connie
myers
that
night
or
to
whom
they
had
so
considerately
loaned
their
automobile
he
was
running
now
through
lanes
dodging
down
side
streets
taking
every
short
cut
he
knew
had
he
beaten
the
police
to
mike
hagan
room
it
would
be
easy
then
if
they
were
ahead
of
him
then
by
some
means
or
other
he
must
still
get
that
paper
first
he
was
at
the
tenement
now
shuffling
leisurely
up
the
steps
the
front
door
was
open
he
entered
and
went
up
the
first
flight
of
stairs
then
along
the
hall
and
up
the
next
flight
he
had
half
expected
the
place
to
be
bustling
with
excitement
over
the
crime
but
the
police
evidently
had
kept
the
affair
quiet
for
he
had
seen
no
one
since
he
had
entered
but
now
as
he
began
to
mount
the
third
flight
he
went
more
slowly
some
one
was
ahead
of
him
it
was
very
dark
he
could
not
see
the
steps
above
died
away
he
reached
the
landing
started
along
for
hagan
room
and
a
light
blazed
suddenly
in
his
face
and
a
hard
quick
grip
on
his
shoulder
forced
him
back
against
the
wall
then
the
flashlight
wavered
glistened
on
brass
buttons
went
out
and
a
voice
laughed
roughly
it
only
larry
the
bat
larry
the
bat
eh
it
was
another
voice
harsh
and
curt
what
are
you
doing
here
he
was
not
first
after
all
the
telephone
message
from
pelham
it
was
almost
certainly
that
had
beaten
him
they
were
ahead
of
him
just
ahead
of
him
they
had
only
been
a
few
steps
ahead
of
him
going
up
the
stairs
just
a
second
ahead
of
him
on
their
way
to
hagan
room
jimmie
dale
was
thinking
fast
now
he
must
go
too
to
hagan
room

somehow
there

no

was
hagan
life
at
stake

jimmie

grimly
it
was
far
more
than
he
had
dared
to
hope
for
they
were
playing
into
his
hands
but
i
do

grovelled
larry
the
bat
piteously
who

growled
the
officer
you
supposed

snitched
the
lay
to
us
that
all
and
mind
you
play
your
part
come
on
it
was
two
doors
down
the
hall
to
mike
hagan
room
and
there
one
of
the
officers
putting
his
shoulder
to
the
door
burst
it
open
and
sprang
in
the
other
shoved
jimmie
dale
forward
it
was
quickly
done
the
three
were
in
the
room
the
door
was
closed
again
came
a
cry
of
terror
out
of
the
darkness
a
movement
as
of
some
one
rising
up
hurriedly
in
bed
and
then
hagan
voice
what
is
it
who
is
it
mike
the
table
it
was
against
the
wall
jimmie
date
remembered
he
sidled
quickly
toward
it
strike
a
light
ordered
the
officer
in
charge
jimmie
dale
fingers
were
feeling
under
the
edge
of
the
table
a
quick
sweep
along
it
nothing
he
stooped
reaching
farther
in
another
sweep
of
his
arm
and
his
fingers
closed
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
piece
of
hard
gum
in
an
instant
they
were
in
his
pocket
a
match
crackled
and
flared
up
a
lamp
was
lighted
larry
the
bat
sulked
sullenly
against
the
wall
hagan
had
clutched
the
child
lying
beside
her
to
her
arms
and
was
sitting
bolt
upright
in
bed
now
then
no
fuss
about
it
said
the
officer
in
charge
with
brutal
directness
you
might
as
well
make
a
clean
breast
of
mike

in
that
murder
downstairs
larry
the
bat

the
whole
story
come
on
now
out
with
it
murder
her
face
went
white
my
mike

she
seemed
for
an
instant
stunned
and
then
down
the
worn
thin
haggard
face
gushed
the
tears
i
do
believe
it
she
cried
i
do
believe
it
come
on
now
cut
that
out
prodded
the
officer
roughly
i
tell
you
larry
the
bat
here

opened
everything
up
wide
you
only
making
it
worse
for
him
she
was
staring
now
at
jimmie
dale
oh

she
cried
so
that
what
you
are
are
you
a
for
the
cops
well
whatever

told

curse

mike

you
that

to
make
him
bad
but
murder

lie
she
had
risen
slowly
from
the
bed
a
gaunt
pitiful
figure
pitifully
clothed
the
black
hair
streaming
thinly
over
her
shoulders
still
clutching
the
baby
that
too
was
crying
now
the
officers
looked
at
one
another
and
nodded
guess
she
handing
it
straight
we
have
a
look
on
our
own
hook
the
leader
muttered
she
paid
no
attention
to
them
she
was
walking
straight
to
jimmie
dale
it
you
is
it
she
whispered
fiercely
through
her
sobs
that
would
bring
more
shame
and
ruin
here
you
that
selling
my
man
life
away
with
your
filthy
lies
for
what
they
paying
you
it
you
is
it
that
her
voice
broke
there
was
a
frightened
uneasy
look
in
larry
the
bat
eyes
his
lips
were
twitching
weakly
he
drew
far
back
against
the
wall
and
then
glancing
miserably
at
the
officers
as
though
entreating
their
permission
began
to
edge
toward
the
door
for
a
moment
she
watched
him
her
face
white
with
outrage
her
hand
clenched
at
her
side
and
then
she
found
her
voice
again
get
out
of
here
she
said
in
a
choked
strained
way
pointing
to
the
door
get
out
of
here
you
dirty
skate
sure
mumbled
larry
the
bat
his
eyes
on
the
floor
sure
he
mumbled
and
the
door
closed
behind
him
part
two
the
woman
in
the
case
chapter
i
below
the
dead
line
whisperings
always
whisperings
low
sibilant
floating
errantly
from
all
sides
until
they
seemed
a
component
part
of
the
atmosphere
itself
and
occasionally
another
sound
the
soft
of
feet
the
faint
rustle
of
equally
garments
and
everywhere
the
sweet
sickish
smell
of
opium
it
was
chang
foo
simply
a
cellar
or
two
deeper
in
chang
foo
than
that
in
which
dago
jim
had
quarrelled
once
and
died
larry
the
bat
unkempt
disreputable
lay
sprawled
out
on
one
of
the
dive
bunks
an
opium
pipe
beside
him
but
larry
the
bat
was
not
smoking
instead
his
ear
was
pressed
closely
against
the
boarding
that
formed
the
rather
flimsy
partition
at
the
side
of
the
bunk
one
heard
many
things
in
chang
foo
if
one
cared
to
listen
if
one
could
first
win
one
way
through
the
carefully
guarded
gateway
that
to
the
uninitiated
offered
nothing
more
interesting
than
the
entrance
to
a
chinese
and
an
uninviting
one
at
that
had
he
been
followed
in
here
he
had
been
shadowed
for
the
last
hour
of
that
at
least
he
was
certain
why
by
whom
for
an
hour
he
had
dodged
in
and
out
through
the
dens
of
the
underworld
as
only
one
who
was
at
home
there
and
known
to
all
could
do
and
at
last
he
had
taken
refuge
in
chang
foo
like
a
fox
burrowing
deep
into
its
hole
few
could
find
their
way
into
the
most
infamous
opium
den
in
all
new
york
where
not
only
the
poppy
ruled
as
master
but
where
crime
was
hatched
ay
and
carried
to
its
ghastly
consummation
sometimes
as
well
and
of
those
few
not
one
but
was
of
the
underworld
itself
and
it
was
that
fact
which
held
his
muscles
strained
and
rigid
now
under
the
miserable
rags
that
covered
them
and
it
was
that
which
kept
the
keen
quick
brain
alert
and
active
every
faculty
keyed
up
and
tense
if
it
were
the
police
he
had
little
to
fear
for
they
could
not
force
their
way
in
without
warning
but
if
it
were
the
underworld
he
was
in
imminent
peril
and
had
done
little
better
than
run
himself
into
a
trap
from
which
there
was
no
escape
death
to
the
gray
seal
he
had
heard
that
whispered
more
than
once
in
this
very
place
who
knew
at
what
moment
the
role
of
larry
the
bat
would
be
uncovered
and
the
underworld
where
now
he
held
so
high
a
place
would
be
at
his
throat
like
a
pack
of
snarling
wolves
who
had
been
shadowing
him
during
the
last
hour
whisperings
nothing
tangible
he
could
catch
no
words
only
the
whisperings
of
gathered
groups
here
and
there
and
sometimes
the
clink
of
coin
where
some
game
was
in
progress
the
curtain
before
his
bunk
was
drawn
suddenly
aside
and
larry
the
bat
fingers
where
his
hand
was
carelessly
hidden
by
his
body
tightened
upon
his
automatic
smokee
some
more
the
fingers
relaxed
it
was
only
sam
wah
one
of
the
attendants
nix
said
larry
the
bat
in
a
slightly
muddled
tone
got
the
curtain
fell
into
place
again
larry
the
bat
lips
set
in
a
thin
smile
ultimately
it
made
little
difference
whether
it
was
the
police
or
the
underworld
the
smile
grew
thinner
it
was
the
flip
of
a
coin
that
was
all
with
one
there
was
the
death
house
at
sing
sing
for
the
gray
seal
with
the
other
well
there
were
many
ways
from
a
shot
or
a
knife
thrust
in
the
open
street
to
his
murder
in
some
hidden
dive
like
this
of
chang
foo
for
instance
where
he
now
was
the
gray
seal
was
responsible
for
the
occupancy
of
too
many
penitentiary
cells
by
those
of
the
underworld
to
look
for
any
other
fate
he
raised
himself
up
sharply
on
his
elbow
a
shrill
high
note
like
the
scream
of
a
parrakeet
rang
out
a
second
time
he
tore
the
curtain
aside
and
jumped
to
his
feet
all
around
him
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
chinamen
in
fluttering
blouses
chattering
like
magpies
mingled
with
snarling
cursing
whites
were
running
madly
a
voice
prefaced
with
an
oath
bawled
out
behind
him
as
he
sprang
forward
and
joined
the
rush
beat
it
de
cops
beat
it
the
police
a
raid
was
it
for
him
from
rooms
an
amazing
number
of
them
more
forms
rushed
out
joined
divided
separated
and
dashed
some
this
way
some
that
along
branching
passageways
there
had
been
raids
before
the
police
had
begun
to
change
their
minds
about
chang
foo
but
chang
foo
was
not
an
easy
place
to
raid
house
after
house
in
that
quarter
of
chinese
laundries
of
tea
shops
of
joints
opened
one
into
the
other
through
secret
passages
in
the
cellars
larry
the
bat
plunged
down
a
staircase
and
halted
in
the
darkness
of
a
cellar
drawing
back
against
the
wall
while
the
flying
feet
of
his
fellow
fugitives
scurried
by
him
was
it
for
him
this
raid
if
not
the
police
had
not
a
hope
of
getting
him
if
he
kept
his
head
for
back
in
chang
foo
proper
which
would
be
quite
closed
off
now
chang
foo
would
be
blandly
submitting
to
arrest
offering
himself
as
a
sort
of
glorified
sacrifice
while
the
police
confiscated
opium
and
layouts
if
the
police
had
no
other
purpose
than
that
in
mind
chang
foo
would
simply
pay
a
fine
the
next
night
the
place
would
be
in
full
blast
again
and
chang
foo
higher
than
ever
in
the
confidence
of
the
underworld
aristocracy
would
reap
his
reward
and
that
would
be
all
there
was
to
it
but
was
that
all
the
raid
had
followed
significantly
close
upon
the
heels
of
his
entry
into
chang
foo
larry
the
bat
began
to
move
forward
again
he
dared
not
follow
the
others
and
later
on
when
quiet
was
restored
issue
out
into
the
street
from
any
one
of
the
various
houses
in
which
he
might
temporarily
have
taken
refuge
there
was
a
chance
in
that
a
chance
that
the
police
might
be
more
zealous
than
usual
even
if
he
particularly
was
not
their
game
and
he
could
take
no
chance
arrest
for
larry
the
bat
even
on
suspicion
could
have
but
one
conclusion
not
a
pleasant
one
the
disclosure
that
larry
the
bat
was
not
larry
the
bat
at
all
but
jimmie
dale
the
millionaire
and
to
complete
a
fatal
triplication
that
larry
the
bat
and
jimmie
dale
was
the
gray
seal
upon
whose
head
was
fixed
a
price
all
was
silence
around
him
now
except
that
from
overhead
came
occasionally
the
muffled
tread
of
feet
he
felt
his
way
along
into
a
black
narrow
passage
emerged
into
a
second
cellar
swept
the
place
with
a
single
circling
gleam
from
a
pocket
flashlight
passed
a
stairway
that
led
upward
reached
the
opposite
wall
and
dropping
on
hands
and
knees
crawled
into
what
innocently
enough
appeared
to
be
the
opening
of
a
coal
bin
he
knew
chang
foo
well
as
he
knew
the
ins
and
outs
of
every
den
and
place
he
frequented
knew
them
as
a
man
knows
such
things
when
his
life
at
any
moment
might
hang
upon
his
knowledge
he
was
in
another
passage
now
and
this
in
a
few
steps
brought
him
to
a
door
here
he
halted
and
stood
for
a
full
five
minutes
absolutely
motionless
absolutely
still
listening
there
was
nothing
not
a
sound
he
tried
the
door
cautiously
it
was
locked
the
slim
sensitive
tapering
fingers
of
jimmie
dale
unrecognisable
now
in
the
grimy
digits
of
larry
the
bat
felt
tentatively
over
the
lock
to
fingers
that
seemed
in
their
tips
to
possess
all
the
human
senses
that
time
and
again
in
their
delicate
touch
upon
the
dial
of
a
safe
had
mocked
at
human
ingenuity
and
driven
the
police
into
impotent
frenzy
this
was
a
pitiful
thing
from
his
pocket
came
a
small
steel
instrument
that
was
quickly
and
deftly
inserted
in
the
keyhole
there
was
a
click
the
door
swung
open
and
jimmie
dale
alias
larry
the
bat
stepped
outside
into
a
back
yard
half
a
block
away
from
the
entrance
to
chang
foo
again
he
listened
there
did
not
appear
to
be
any
unusual
excitement
in
the
neighbourhood
from
open
windows
above
him
and
from
adjoining
houses
came
the
ordinary
commonplace
sounds
of
voices
talking
and
laughing
even
the
queer
weird
notes
of
a
chinese
chant
he
stole
noiselessly
across
the
yard
out
into
the
lane
and
made
his
way
rapidly
along
to
the
cross
street
in
a
measure
now
he
was
safe
but
one
thing
a
very
vital
thing
remained
to
be
done
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
know
whether
he
was
the
quarry
that
the
police
had
been
after
in
the
raid
if
it
was
the
police
who
had
been
shadowing
him
all
evening
if
it
was
the
police
there
was
but
one
meaning
to
it
larry
the
bat
was
known
to
be
the
gray
seal
and
a
problem
perilous
enough
in
any
aspect
confronted
him
dare
he
risk
the
sanctuary
for
the
clothes
of
jimmie
dale
or
was
it
safer
to
burglarise
as
he
had
once
done
before
his
own
mansion
on
riverside
drive
his
thoughts
were
running
riot
and
he
frowned
angry
with
himself
there
was
time
enough
to
think
of
that
when
he
knew
that
it
was
the
police
against
whom
he
had
to
match
his
wits
well
in
the
shadow
of
the
buildings
he
moved
swiftly
along
the
side
street
until
he
came
to
the
corner
of
the
street
on
which
halfway
down
the
block
fronted
chang
foo
a
glance
in
that
direction
and
jimmie
dale
drew
a
breath
of
relief
a
patrol
wagon
was
backed
up
to
the
curb
and
a
half
dozen
officers
were
busy
loading
it
with
what
was
evidently
chang
foo
far
from
meagre
stock
of
gambling
appurtenances
while
chang
foo
himself
together
with
sam
wah
and
another
attendant
were
in
the
grip
of
two
other
officers
waiting
possibly
for
another
patrol
wagon
there
was
a
crowd
too
but
the
crowd
was
at
a
respectful
distance
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
jimmie
dale
still
hugged
the
corner
a
man
swaggered
out
from
a
doorway
quite
close
to
chang
foo
and
came
on
along
the
street
as
the
other
reached
the
corner
jimmie
dale
sidled
forward
chick
he
said
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth

himself
dat

larry
i

chick
responded
jimmie
dale
and
started
slowly
back
along
the
cross
street
it
was
not
the
police
then
who
were
interested
in
his
movements
then
who
he
shook
his
head
with
a
little
savage
impotent
gesture
one
thing
was
clear
it
was
too
early
to
risk
a
return
to
the
sanctuary
and
attempt
the
rehabilitation
of
jimmie
dale
if
any
one
was
on
the
hunt
for
larry
the
bat
the
sanctuary
would
be
the
last
place
to
be
overlooked
he
turned
the
next
corner
hesitated
a
moment
in
front
of
a
garishly
lighted
dance
hall
and
finally
shuffled
in
through
the
door
made
his
way
across
the
floor
nodding
here
and
there
to
the
elite
of
gangland
and
with
a
somewhat
arrogant
air
of
proprietorship
sat
down
at
a
table
in
the
corner
little
better
than
a
tramp
in
appearance
certainly
the
most
object
in
the
place
even
the
waiter
who
approached
him
accorded
him
a
certain
curious
deference
was
not
larry
the
bat
the
most
celebrated
dope
fiend
below
the
dead
line
gim
me
a
mug
o
suds
ordered
jimmie
dale
and
sprawled
royally
back
in
his
chair
under
the
rim
of
his
slouch
hat
pulled
now
far
over
his
eyes
he
searched
the
faces
around
him
if
he
had
been
asked
to
pick
the
actors
for
a
revel
from
the
scum
of
the
underworld
he
could
not
have
improved
upon
the
gathering
there
were
perhaps
a
hundred
men
and
women
in
the
room
the
majority
dancing
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
slummers
they
were
men
and
women
whose
acquaintance
with
the
police
was
intimate
but
not
cordial
far
from
cordial
jimmie
dale
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
sipped
at
the
glass
that
had
been
set
before
him
it
was
grimly
ironic
that
he
should
be
not
only
there
but
actually
a
factor
and
a
part
of
the
underworld
intimate
life
he
jimmie
dale
a
wealthy
man
a
member
of
new
exclusive
clubs
a
member
of
new
york
most
exclusive
society
it
was
inconceivable
he
smiled
sardonically
was
it
well
then
it
was
none
the
less
true
his
life
unquestionably
was
one
unique
apart
from
any
other
man
but
it
was
for
all
that
actual
and
real
there
had
been
three
years
of
it
now
since
she
had
come
into
his
life
jimmie
dale
slouched
down
a
little
in
his
chair
the
ice
was
thin
perilously
thin
that
he
was
skating
on
now
each
letter
with
its
demand
upon
him
to
match
his
wits
against
police
or
underworld
or
against
both
combined
perhaps
made
that
peril
a
little
greater
a
little
more
imminent
if
that
were
possible
when
already
his
life
was
almost
literally
carried
daily
hourly
in
his
hand
not
that
he
rebelled
against
it
it
was
worth
the
price
that
some
day
he
expected
he
must
pay
the
price
of
honour
wealth
a
name
disgraced
ruin
death
was
he
quixotic
immoderately
so
he
smiled
gravely
perhaps
but
he
would
do
it
all
over
again
if
the
choice
were
his
there
were
those
who
blessed
the
name
of
the
gray
seal
as
well
as
those
who
cursed
it
and
there
was
the
tocsin
who
was
she
he
did
not
know
but
he
knew
that
he
had
come
to
love
her
come
to
care
for
her
and
that
she
had
come
to
mean
everything
in
life
to
him
he
had
never
seen
her
to
know
her
face
he
had
never
seen
her
face
but
he
knew
her
voice
ay
he
had
even
held
her
for
a
moment
the
moment
of
wildest
happiness
he
had
ever
known
in
his
arms
that
night
when
he
had
entered
his
library
his
own
particular
den
in
his
own
house
and
in
the
darkness
had
found
her
there
found
her
finally
through
no
effort
of
his
own
when
he
had
searched
so
fruitlessly
for
years
to
find
her
using
every
resource
at
his
command
to
find
her
and
she
because
she
had
come
of
her
own
volition
relying
upon
him
had
held
him
in
honour
to
let
her
go
as
she
had
come
without
looking
upon
her
face
exquisite
irony
but
she
had
made
him
a
promise
then
that
the
work
of
the
gray
seal
was
nearly
over
that
soon
there
would
be
an
end
to
the
mystery
that
surrounded
her
that
he
should
know
all
that
he
should
know
her
he
smiled
again
but
it
was
a
twisted
smile
on
the
mechanically
misshapen
lips
of
larry
the
bat
nearly
over
who
knew
that
nearly
might
be
too
late
even
tonight
he
had
been
shadowed
was
skulking
even
now
in
this
place
as
a
refuge
who
knew
another
hour
and
the
newsboys
might
be
shrieking
their
uxtra
uxtra
de
gray
seal
caught
de
millionaire
jimmie
dale
de
jekyll
an
hyde
of
real
life
jimmie
dale
straightened
up
suddenly
in
his
seat
there
was
a
shout
an
oath
bawled
out
high
above
the
riot
of
noise
a
chorus
of
feminine
shrieks
from
across
the
room
what
was
the
matter
with
the
underworld
he
seemed
fated
to
find
nothing
but
centres
of
disturbance
first
a
raid
at
chang
foo
and
now
this
what
was
the
matter
here
they
were
stampeding
toward
him
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
there
was
the
roar
of
a
revolver
shot
another
black
ike
he
caught
an
instant
glimpse
of
the
gunman
distorted
face
through
the
crowd
that
was
it
probably
a
row
over
some
moll
and
then
as
jimmie
dale
lunged
up
from
his
chair
to
his
feet
to
escape
the
rush
pandemonium
itself
seemed
to
break
loose
yells
shots
screams
and
oaths
filled
the
air
the
crowd
surged
this
way
and
that
tables
were
overturned
and
sent
crashing
to
the
floor
and
then
came
sudden
darkness
as
some
one
of
the
attendants
in
misguided
excitability
switched
off
the
lights
the
darkness
but
served
to
increase
the
panic
not
allay
it
with
a
savage
snap
of
his
jaws
jimmie
dale
swung
from
his
table
in
the
corner
with
the
intention
of
making
his
way
out
by
a
side
door
behind
him
it
was
a
case
of
the
police
again
and
the
patrolman
outside
would
probably
be
pulling
a
riot
call
by
now
and
the
police
he
stopped
suddenly
as
though
he
had
been
struck
an
envelope
thrust
there
out
of
the
darkness
was
in
his
hand
and
her
voice
hers
the
tocsin
was
sounding
in
his
ears
jimmie
jimmie
i
been
trying
all
evening
to
catch
you
quick
get
to
the
sanctuary
and
change
your
clothes
there
not
an
instant
to
lose
it
for
my
sake
and
then
a
surging
mob
was
around
him
on
every
side
and
pushing
jostling
half
lifting
him
at
times
from
his
feet
carried
him
forward
with
its
rush
and
with
him
in
its
midst
burst
through
the
door
and
out
into
the
street
chapter
ii
the
call
to
arms
not
a
sound
as
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
not
a
sound
as
the
door
swung
back
on
its
carefully
oiled
hinges
not
a
sound
as
larry
the
bat
slipped
like
a
shadow
into
the
blackness
of
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
him
again
with
a
tread
as
noiseless
as
a
cat
he
was
across
the
room
to
satisfy
himself
that
the
shutters
were
tightly
closed
and
then
the
single
gas
jet
flared
up
murky
yellow
illuminating
the
miserable
squalid
room
the
sanctuary
the
home
of
larry
the
bat
there
was
need
for
silence
need
for
caution
in
five
minutes
ten
at
the
outside
he
must
emerge
again
as
jimmie
dale
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
that
mingled
curiously
chagrin
and
he
took
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
tore
it
open
it
was
she
then
who
had
been
following
him
all
evening
and
like
a
blundering
idiot
he
had
wasted
precious
perhaps
irreparable
hours
what
had
she
meant
by
it
for
my
sake
the
words
had
been
ringing
in
his
ears
since
the
moment
she
had
whispered
them
in
that
crowd
was
it
not
always
for
her
sake
that
he
answered
these
calls
to
arms
was
it
not
always
for
her
sake
that
he
as
the
gray
seal
was
the
mental
soliloquy
came
to
an
abrupt
end
he
had
subconsciously
read
the
first
sentence
of
the
letter
and
now
with
sudden
feverish
eagerness
and
excitement
he
was
reading
it
to
the
last
word
dear
philanthropic
crook
in
an
hour
after
you
receive
this
if
all
goes
well
you
shall
know
everything
everything
who
i
am
yes
and
my
name
it
has
been
more
than
three
years
now
has
it
it
has
been
incomprehensible
to
you
but
there
has
been
no
other
way
i
dared
not
take
the
chance
of
discovery
by
any
one
i
dared
not
expose
you
to
the
risk
of
being
known
by
me
your
life
would
not
have
been
worth
a
moment
purchase
oh
jimmie
am
i
only
making
the
mystery
more
mystifying
but
i
think
i
hope
i
pray
that
it
is
all
at
an
end
though
against
me
and
against
you
when
you
go
to
help
me
is
the
most
powerful
and
pitiless
organisation
of
criminals
that
the
world
has
ever
known
and
the
stake
we
are
playing
for
is
a
fortune
of
millions
and
my
life
and
yet
somehow
i
am
afraid
now
just
because
the
end
is
so
near
and
the
victory
seems
so
surely
won
and
so
jimmie
be
careful
use
all
that
wonderful
cleverness
of
yours
as
you
have
never
used
it
before
and
but
there
should
be
no
need
for
that
it
is
so
simple
a
thing
that
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
do
why
am
i
writing
so
illogically
nothing
surely
can
possibly
happen
this
is
not
like
one
of
my
usual
letters
is
it
i
am
beside
myself
with
hope
anxiety
fear
and
excitement
listen
then
jimmie
be
at
the
northeast
corner
of
sixth
avenue
and
waverly
place
at
exactly
ten
a
taxicab
will
drive
up
as
though
you
had
signalled
it
in
passing
and
the
chauffeur
will
say
another
fare
in
half
an
hour
sir
but
i
can
get
you
most
anywhere
in
that
time
you
will
be
smoking
a
cigarette
toss
it
out
into
the
street
make
any
reply
you
like
and
get
into
the
cab
give
the
chauffeur
that
little
ring
of
mine
with
the
crest
of
the
bell
and
belfry
and
the
motto
le
tocsin
that
you
found
the
night
old
isaac
pelina
was
murdered
and
the
chauffeur
will
give
you
in
exchange
a
sealed
packet
of
papers
he
will
drive
you
to
your
home
and
i
will
telephone
to
you
there
i
need
not
tell
you
to
destroy
this
keep
the
appointment
in
your
proper
person
as
jimmie
dale
carry
nothing
that
might
identify
you
as
the
gray
seal
if
any
accident
should
happen
and
lastly
trust
the
pseudo
chauffeur
there
was
no
signature
her
letters
were
never
signed
he
stood
for
a
moment
staring
at
the
closely
written
sheets
in
his
hand
a
heightened
colour
in
his
cheeks
his
lips
pressed
tightly
together
and
then
his
fingers
automatically
began
to
tear
the
letter
into
pieces
and
the
pieces
again
into
little
shreds
it
was
to
be
the
end
of
all
this
mystery
was
to
see
the
end
of
this
dual
life
of
his
with
its
constant
peril
the
gray
seal
was
to
exit
from
the
stage
forever
a
wonderful
climax
of
the
years
he
was
to
see
her
his
blood
was
quickened
now
his
heart
pounding
in
a
faster
beat
a
mad
elation
a
fierce
uplift
was
upon
him
he
thrust
the
torn
bits
of
paper
into
his
pocket
hurriedly
stepped
across
the
room
to
the
corner
rolled
back
the
oilcloth
and
lifted
up
the
loose
plank
in
the
flooring
so
innocently
dustladen
as
more
than
once
to
have
eluded
the
eyes
of
inquisitive
visitors
in
the
shape
of
police
and
plain
clothes
men
from
headquarters
from
the
space
beneath
he
removed
a
neatly
folded
pile
of
clothes
laid
these
on
the
bed
and
began
to
undress
he
was
working
rapidly
now
tiny
pieces
of
wax
were
removed
from
his
nostrils
from
under
his
lips
from
behind
his
ears
water
from
a
cracked
pitcher
poured
into
a
battered
tin
basin
and
mixed
with
a
few
drops
of
some
liquid
from
a
bottle
which
he
procured
from
its
hiding
place
under
the
flooring
banished
the
stain
from
his
face
his
neck
his
wrists
and
hands
as
if
by
magic
it
was
a
strange
metamorphosis
that
had
taken
place
the
coarse
leering
countenance
of
larry
the
bat
was
gone
and
in
its
place
was
the
face
of
jimmie
dale
and
where
before
had
slouched
a
misshapen
flabby
creature
a
form
well
over
six
feet
in
height
now
stood
erect
and
under
the
clean
white
skin
the
muscles
of
an
athlete
like
knobs
of
steel
played
back
and
forth
with
every
movement
of
his
body
in
the
streaked
and
broken
mirror
jimmie
dale
surveyed
himself
critically
methodically
and
with
a
nod
of
satisfaction
hastily
donned
the
fashionably
cut
suit
of
tweeds
upon
the
bed
he
rummaged
then
through
the
ragged
garments
he
had
just
discarded
transferred
to
his
pockets
a
roll
of
bills
and
his
automatic
and
paused
hesitantly
staring
at
the
thin
metal
case
like
a
cigarette
case
that
he
held
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
little
whimsically
it
seemed
strange
indeed
that
he
was
through
with
that
he
snapped
it
open
within
between
sheets
of
oil
paper
lay
the
scores
of
little
adhesive
paper
seals
the
insignia
of
the
gray
seal
yes
it
seemed
strange
that
he
was
never
to
use
another
he
closed
the
case
gathered
up
the
clothes
of
larry
the
bat
tucked
the
case
in
among
them
and
shoved
the
bundle
into
the
hole
under
the
flooring
all
these
things
would
have
to
be
destroyed
but
there
was
not
time
or
the
next
day
would
do
for
that
what
would
it
be
like
to
live
a
normal
life
again
without
the
menace
of
danger
lurking
on
every
hand
without
that
grim
slogan
of
the
underworld
death
to
the
gray
seal
or
that
savage
fiat
of
the
police
the
gray
seal
dead
or
alive
but
the
gray
seal
forever
ringing
in
his
ears
what
would
it
be
like
this
new
life
with
her
the
thought
was
thrilling
him
again
bringing
again
that
eager
exultant
uplift
in
an
hour
one
hour
and
the
barriers
of
years
would
be
swept
away
and
she
would
be
in
his
arms
it
for
my
sake
his
face
grew
suddenly
tense
as
the
words
came
back
to
him
that
hour
was
over
yet
it
was
no
hysterical
exaggeration
that
had
prompted
her
to
call
her
enemies
the
most
powerful
and
pitiless
organisation
of
criminals
that
the
world
had
ever
known
it
was
not
the
tocsin
way
to
exaggerate
the
words
would
be
literally
true
the
very
life
she
had
led
for
the
three
years
that
had
gone
stood
out
now
as
a
grim
proof
of
her
assertion
jimmie
dale
replaced
the
flooring
carefully
brushed
the
dust
back
into
the
cracks
spread
the
oilcloth
into
place
and
stood
up
who
and
what
was
this
organisation
what
was
between
it
and
the
tocsin
what
was
this
immense
fortune
that
was
at
stake
and
what
was
this
priceless
packet
that
was
so
crucial
that
meant
victory
now
ay
and
her
life
too
she
had
said
the
questions
swept
upon
him
in
a
sort
of
breathless
succession
why
had
she
not
let
him
play
a
part
in
this
true
she
had
told
him
why
that
she
dared
not
expose
him
to
the
risk
risk
was
there
any
risk
that
the
gray
seal
had
not
taken
and
at
her
instance
he
did
not
understand
he
smiled
a
little
uncertainly
as
he
reached
up
to
turn
out
the
gas
there
were
a
good
many
things
that
he
did
not
understand
about
the
tocsin
the
room
was
in
darkness
and
with
the
darkness
jimmie
dale
mind
centred
on
the
work
immediately
before
him
to
enter
the
tenement
where
he
was
known
and
had
an
acknowledged
right
as
larry
the
bat
was
one
thing
for
jimmie
dale
to
be
discovered
there
was
quite
another
he
crossed
the
room
opened
the
door
silently
stood
for
a
moment
listening
then
stepped
out
into
the
black
musty
hallway
closing
the
door
behind
him
he
stooped
and
locked
it
the
querulous
cry
of
a
child
reached
him
from
somewhere
above
a
murmur
of
voices
muffled
by
closed
doors
from
everywhere
how
many
families
were
housed
beneath
that
sordid
roof
he
had
never
known
only
that
there
was
miserable
poverty
there
as
well
as
vice
and
crime
only
that
larry
the
bat
who
possessed
a
room
all
to
himself
was
as
some
lordly
and
to
these
fellow
tenants
who
shared
theirs
with
so
many
that
there
was
not
air
enough
for
all
to
breathe
he
had
no
doors
to
pass
his
was
next
to
the
staircase
he
began
to
descend
they
could
scream
and
shriek
those
stairs
like
aged
humans
twisted
and
rheumatic
at
the
least
ungentle
touch
but
there
was
no
sound
from
them
now
there
seemed
something
almost
uncanny
in
the
silent
tread
stair
after
stair
he
descended
his
entire
weight
thrown
gradually
upon
one
foot
before
the
other
was
lifted
the
strain
upon
the
muscles
trained
and
hardened
as
they
were
told
as
he
moved
from
the
bottom
step
he
wiped
little
beads
of
perspiration
from
his
forehead
the
door
now
that
gave
on
the
alleyway
he
opened
it
slipped
outside
darted
across
the
narrow
lane
stole
along
where
the
shadows
of
the
fence
were
blackest
paused
listening
as
he
reached
the
end
of
the
alleyway
to
assure
himself
that
there
was
no
pedestrian
and
stepped
out
into
the
street
he
kept
on
along
the
block
turned
into
the
bowery
and
under
the
first
lamp
consulted
his
watch
it
was
a
quarter
past
ten
he
could
make
it
easily
in
a
leisurely
walk
he
continued
on
up
the
bowery
finally
crossed
to
broadway
and
shortly
afterward
turned
into
waverly
place
at
the
corner
of
fifth
avenue
he
consulted
his
watch
again
and
now
he
lighted
a
cigarette
sixth
avenue
was
only
a
block
away
at
precisely
ten
to
the
second
he
halted
on
the
designated
corner
smoking
nonchalantly
a
taxicab
coincidentally
coming
from
an
uptown
direction
swung
in
to
the
curb
taxi
sir
yes
sir
then
with
an
admirable
mingling
of
eagerness
to
secure
the
fare
and
a
fear
that
his
confession
might
cause
him
the
loss
of
it
i
another
fare
in
half
an
hour
sir
but
i
can
get
you
most
anywhere
in
that
jimmie
dale
cigarette
was
tossed
carelessly
into
the
street
st
james
club
he
said
curtly
and
stepped
into
the
cab
the
cab
started
forward
turned
the
corner
and
headed
along
waverly
place
toward
broadway
the
chauffeur
twisted
around
in
his
seat
in
a
way
as
though
to
ask
further
directions
have
you
anything
for
me
he
inquired
casually
it
lay
where
it
always
lay
that
ring
between
the
folds
of
that
little
white
glove
in
his
pocketbook
jimmie
dale
took
it
out
now
and
handed
it
silently
to
the
chauffeur
the
other
face
changed
instantly
composure
was
gone
and
a
quick
strained
look
was
in
its
place
i
afraid
i
been
watched
he
said
tersely
look
behind
you
will
you
and
tell
me
if
you
see
anything
jimmie
dale
glanced
backward
through
the
little
window
in
the
hood
there
another
taxi
just
turned
in
from
sixth
avenue
he
reported
the
next
instant
keep
your
eye
on
it
instructed
the
chauffeur
shortly
the
speed
of
the
cab
increased
sensibly
with
a
curious
tightening
of
his
lips
jimmie
dale
settled
himself
in
his
seat
so
that
he
could
watch
the
cab
behind
there
was
trouble
coming
intuitively
he
sensed
that
and
he
reflected
bitterly
he
might
have
known
it
was
too
marvellous
too
wonderful
ever
to
come
to
pass
that
this
one
hour
the
thought
of
which
had
fired
his
blood
and
made
him
glad
beyond
any
gladness
life
had
ever
held
for
him
before
should
bring
its
promised
happiness
where
the
cab
now
the
chauffeur
flung
back
over
his
shoulder
they
had
passed
fifth
avenue
and
were
nearing
broadway
about
the
same
distance
behind
jimmie
dale
answered
that
looks
bad
the
chauffeur
gritted
between
his
teeth
we
have
to
make
sure
i
run
down
lower
if
you
think
we
followed
suggested
jimmie
dale
quietly
why
not
run
uptown
and
give
them
the
slip
somewhere
where
the
traffic
is
thick
lower
broadway
at
this
time
of
night
is
as
empty
and
deserted
as
a
country
the
chauffeur
sudden
laugh
was
mirthless
my
god
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
he
burst
out
if
they
following
all
hell
could
throw
them
off
the
track
and
got
to
know
i
got
to
be
sure
before
i
dare
make
a
move
i
could
tell
up
in
the
crowded
districts
if
i
was
followed
could
i
they
wo
come
out
into
the
open
until
their
hands
are
the
car
swerved
sharply
rounded
the
corner
and
speeding
up
faster
and
faster
began
to
tear
down
lower
broadway
watch
watch
cried
the
chauffeur
there
was
no
word
between
them
for
a
moment
then
jimmie
dale
spoke
crisply
it
turned
the
corner
it
coming
this
way
the
taxicab
was
rocking
violently
with
the
speed
silent
empty
lower
broadway
stretched
away
ahead
apart
from
an
occasional
street
car
probably
there
would
be
nothing
between
them
and
the
battery
jimmie
dale
glanced
at
his
companion
face
as
a
light
flashing
by
threw
it
into
relief
it
was
set
and
stern
even
a
little
haggard
but
too
there
was
something
else
there
something
that
appealed
instantly
to
jimmie
dale
a
sort
of
bulldog
grit
that
dominated
it
if
he
holds
our
speed
we
know
the
chauffeur
was
shouting
now
to
make
himself
heard
over
the
roar
of
the
car
look
again
where
is
it
now
once
more
jimmie
dale
looked
through
the
little
rear
window
the
cab
had
been
a
block
behind
them
when
it
had
turned
the
corner
and
he
watched
it
now
in
a
sort
of
grim
fascination
there
was
no
possible
doubt
of
it
the
two
bobbing
bouncing
headlights
were
creeping
steadily
nearer
and
then
a
sort
of
unnatural
calm
settled
upon
jimmie
dale
and
his
hand
went
mechanically
to
his
pocket
to
feel
his
automatic
there
as
he
turned
again
to
the
chauffeur
if
you
got
any
more
speed
you
better
use
it
he
said
significantly
the
man
shot
a
quick
look
at
him
they
are
following
us
you
are
sure
yes
said
jimmie
dale
the
chauffeur
laughed
again
in
that
mirthless
savage
way
lean
over
here
where
i
can
talk
to
you
he
rasped
out
the
up
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
guess
but
there
a
chance
for
you
they
do
know
you
in
give
her
more
speed
or
dodge
into
a
cross
street
suggested
jimmie
dale
coolly
they
have
got
us
yet
by
a
long
way
the
other
shook
his
head
it
not
only
that
cab
behind
he
answered
through
set
lips
you
do
know
what
we
up
against
if
they
really
after
us
a
trap
laid
in
every
section
of
this
city
the
devils
it
the
package
they
want
thank
god
for
the
presentiment
that
made
me
leave
it
behind
i
was
going
back
for
it
you
understand
if
i
was
satisfied
that
we
were
followed
listen
there
a
chance
for
you
there
none
for
me
that
package
remember
this
no
one
else
knows
where
it
is
and
life
and
death
to
the
one
who
sent
you
here
it
in
box
at
my
god
look
look
there
he
yelled
and
with
a
wrench
at
the
wheel
sent
the
taxi
lurching
and
staggering
for
the
car
tracks
in
the
centre
of
the
street
the
scene
fast
as
thought
itself
was
photographing
itself
in
every
detail
upon
jimmie
dale
brain
from
the
cross
street
ahead
one
from
each
corner
two
motor
cars
had
nosed
out
into
broadway
blocking
the
road
on
both
sides
and
now
the
car
on
the
side
was
moving
forward
across
the
tracks
to
counteract
the
chauffeur
move
deliberately
insuring
a
collision
there
was
no
chance
no
further
room
to
turn
no
time
to
stop
the
man
driving
the
other
car
jumped
for
safety
they
would
be
into
it
in
an
instant
box
jimmie
pleaded
fiercely
go
on
man
go
on
finish
yes
cried
the
chauffeur
john
johansson
at
but
jimmie
dale
heard
no
more
there
was
the
crash
of
impact
as
the
taxicab
plowed
into
the
car
that
had
been
so
craftily
manoeuvered
in
front
of
it
and
jimmie
dale
lifted
from
his
feet
was
hurled
violently
forward
with
the
shock
and
all
went
black
before
his
eyes
chapter
iii
the
crime
club
for
what
length
of
time
he
had
remained
unconscious
jimmie
dale
had
not
the
slightest
idea
he
regained
his
senses
to
find
himself
lying
on
a
couch
in
a
strange
room
that
had
a
most
exquisitely
dome
light
in
the
ceiling
that
was
what
attracted
his
attention
because
the
light
hurt
his
eyes
and
his
head
was
already
throbbing
as
though
a
thousand
devils
were
beating
a
diabolical
tattoo
upon
it
he
closed
his
eyes
against
the
light
where
was
he
what
had
happened
oh
yes
he
remembered
now
that
smash
on
lower
broadway
he
had
been
hurt
he
moved
first
one
limb
and
then
another
tentatively
and
was
relieved
to
find
that
though
his
body
ached
as
if
it
had
been
severely
shaken
and
his
head
was
bad
he
had
apparently
escaped
without
serious
injury
where
was
he
in
a
hospital
his
fingers
resting
at
his
side
upon
the
couch
supplied
him
with
the
information
that
it
was
a
very
expensive
couch
upholstered
in
finest
leather
if
he
were
in
a
hospital
he
would
be
in
a
cot
he
opened
his
eyes
again
to
glance
curiously
around
him
the
room
was
quite
in
keeping
with
the
artistic
lighting
fixture
and
the
refined
if
expensive
taste
that
was
responsible
for
the
couch
a
heavy
velvet
rug
of
rich
dark
green
was
bordered
by
a
polished
hardwood
floor
panellings
of
frieze
and
beautifully
grained
woodwork
made
the
lower
walls
while
above
on
a
background
of
some
paper
hung
a
few
and
evidently
choice
oil
paintings
there
was
a
big
inviting
lounging
chair
a
massive
writing
table
or
more
properly
a
desk
of
walnut
and
behind
the
desk
his
back
half
turned
apparently
intent
upon
a
book
sat
a
man
in
immaculate
evening
dress
jimmie
dale
closed
his
eyes
again
there
was
something
reassuring
about
it
all
comfortably
reassuring
though
why
there
should
be
any
occasion
for
a
feeling
of
reassurance
at
all
he
could
not
for
the
moment
make
out
and
then
in
a
sudden
flash
the
details
of
the
night
came
back
to
him
the
tocsin
letter
the
package
he
was
to
get
the
taxicab
the
chauffeur
who
was
not
a
chauffeur
the
chase
the
trap
he
lay
perfectly
still
it
was
the
professional
jimmie
dale
now
whose
brain
in
spite
of
the
throbbing
brutally
aching
head
was
at
work
keen
alert
the
chauffeur
what
had
happened
to
him
had
the
man
been
killed
in
the
auto
smash
or
less
fortunate
than
himself
fallen
into
the
hands
of
those
whose
power
he
seemed
both
to
fear
and
rate
so
highly
and
that
package
box
what
was
the
number
yes
what
did
that
mean
what
box
where
was
it
who
was
john
johansson
he
had
heard
any
more
than
that
the
smash
had
come
then
and
lastly
he
was
back
again
to
the
same
question
he
had
begun
with
where
was
he
now
himself
it
looked
as
though
some
good
samaritan
had
picked
him
up
who
was
this
gentleman
so
quietly
reading
there
at
the
desk
jimmie
dale
opened
his
eyes
for
the
third
time
how
still
how
absolutely
silent
the
room
was
he
studied
the
man
back
speculatively
for
a
moment
then
his
gaze
travelled
on
past
the
man
to
the
wall
riveted
there
and
his
fingers
without
movement
of
his
arm
pressed
against
the
outside
of
his
coat
pocket
he
thought
as
much
his
automatic
was
gone
not
a
muscle
of
jimmie
dale
face
moved
his
eyes
shifted
to
a
picture
on
the
wall
the
man
was
watching
him
not
reading
just
above
the
level
of
the
desk
a
small
mirror
held
the
couch
in
focus
but
equally
it
held
the
man
in
focus
and
jimmie
dale
had
seen
the
other
eyes
through
a
black
mask
that
covered
the
face
to
the
top
of
the
upper
lip
fixed
intently
upon
him
there
was
a
chill
now
where
before
there
had
been
reassurance
something
ominous
in
the
very
quiet
and
refinement
of
the
room
and
jimmie
dale
smiled
inwardly
in
bitter
irony
his
good
samaritan
wore
a
mask
his
had
come
too
soon
whatever
had
happened
to
the
chauffeur
it
was
evident
enough
that
he
himself
was
caught
what
was
it
the
chauffeur
had
said
something
about
a
chance
through
being
unknown
was
it
to
be
a
battle
of
wits
then
god
if
his
head
did
not
ache
so
frightfully
it
was
hard
to
think
with
the
brain
half
sick
with
pain
those
two
eyes
shining
in
that
mirror
there
seemed
something
horribly
about
it
he
did
not
look
again
but
he
knew
they
were
there
it
was
like
a
cat
watching
a
mouse
why
did
not
the
man
speak
or
move
or
do
something
and
he
turned
his
head
slowly
the
man
was
laughing
in
a
low
amused
way
you
appear
to
be
taken
with
that
picture
observed
a
pleasant
voice
perhaps
you
recognise
it
from
there
it
is
a
jimmie
dale
with
a
start
sat
up
and
with
another
quite
as
well
simulated
stared
at
the
masked
man
the
other
had
laid
down
his
book
and
swung
around
in
his
chair
to
face
the
couch
jimmie
dale
stood
up
a
little
shakily
look
here
he
said
awkwardly
i
i
do
quite
understand
i
remember
that
my
taxi
got
into
a
and
i
suppose
i
have
to
thank
you
for
the
assistance
you
must
have
rendered
me
only
as
i
say
he
looked
in
a
puzzled
way
around
the
room
and
in
an
even
more
perplexed
way
at
the
mask
on
the
other
face
i
must
confess
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
quite
the
meaning
of
suppose
that
instead
of
trying
to
understand
you
simply
accept
things
as
you
find
the
voice
was
soft
but
there
was
a
finality
in
it
that
its
blandness
only
served
to
make
the
more
suggestive
jimmie
dale
drew
himself
up
and
bowed
coldly
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
did
not
mean
to
intrude
i
have
only
to
thank
you
again
then
and
bid
you
the
lips
beneath
the
mask
parted
slightly
in
a
politely
deprecating
smile
there
is
no
hurry
said
the
man
a
sudden
sharpness
creeping
into
his
tones
i
am
sorry
that
the
rule
i
apply
to
you
does
not
work
both
ways
for
instance
i
might
be
quite
at
a
loss
to
account
for
your
presence
in
that
jimmie
dale
smile
was
equally
polite
equally
deprecating
i
fail
to
see
how
it
could
be
of
the
slightest
possible
interest
to
you
he
replied
however
i
have
no
objection
to
telling
you
i
hailed
the
taxi
at
the
corner
of
sixth
avenue
and
waverly
place
told
the
chauffeur
to
drive
me
to
the
james
club
and
the
james
club
broke
in
the
other
coldly
is
i
believe
north
not
south
of
waverly
place
and
on
broadway
not
at
jimmie
dale
stared
at
the
other
for
an
instant
in
patient
annoyance
i
am
quite
well
aware
of
that
he
said
stiffly
nevertheless
i
told
the
man
to
drive
me
to
the
james
club
we
came
across
waverly
place
but
on
reaching
broadway
instead
of
turning
uptown
he
suddenly
whirled
in
the
other
direction
and
sent
the
car
flying
at
full
speed
down
lower
broadway
i
shouted
at
the
man
i
do
know
yet
whether
he
was
drunk
or
crazy
or
jimmie
dale
eyes
fixed
disdainfully
on
the
mask
whether
there
might
not
after
all
have
been
method
in
his
madness
i
can
only
say
that
before
we
had
gone
more
than
two
or
three
blocks
a
wild
effort
on
his
part
to
avoid
a
collision
with
an
auto
swinging
out
from
a
side
street
resulted
in
an
even
more
disastrous
smash
with
another
on
the
other
side
and
i
was
knocked
i
presume
is
the
idea
you
desire
to
convey
observed
the
other
evenly
you
were
quite
the
victim
of
circumstances
as
it
were
jimmie
dale
eyebrows
lifted
slightly
it
would
appear
to
be
fairly
obvious
i
should
very
clever
commented
the
man
but
now
suppose
we
remove
the
buttons
from
the
foils
his
voice
rasped
suddenly
you
are
quite
as
well
aware
as
i
am
that
what
has
happened
was
not
an
accident
nor
in
case
the
possibility
may
have
occurred
to
you
are
the
police
any
the
wiser
save
for
the
existence
of
two
wrecked
cars
on
lower
broadway
and
another
which
escaped
and
for
which
doubtless
they
are
still
searching
assiduously
the
ownership
of
the
taxicab
you
so
inadvertently
entered
they
will
have
no
difficulty
in
establishing
you
perhaps
however
are
in
a
better
position
than
i
am
to
appreciate
the
fact
that
the
establishment
of
its
ownership
will
lead
them
nowhere
as
i
understand
it
the
man
who
drove
you
obtained
the
loan
of
the
cab
from
one
of
the
company
chauffeur
in
return
for
a
bill
am
i
right
in
view
of
what
has
happened
admitted
jimmie
dale
simply
i
should
not
be
there
was
a
sort
of
sardonic
admiration
in
the
other
laugh
as
for
the
other
car
he
went
on
i
can
assure
you
that
its
ownership
will
never
be
known
when
the
nearest
patrolman
rushed
up
there
were
no
survivors
of
the
disaster
save
those
in
the
third
car
which
he
was
powerless
to
stop
which
accounts
for
your
presence
here
you
will
admit
that
i
have
been
quite
oh
quite
said
jimmie
dale
a
little
wearily
but
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
all
this
is
leading
to
the
man
had
been
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
one
hand
palm
downward
resting
lightly
on
the
desk
he
shifted
his
hand
now
suddenly
to
the
arm
of
his
chair
this
he
said
and
on
the
desk
where
his
hand
had
been
lay
the
tocsin
gold
signet
ring
jimmie
dale
face
expressed
mild
curiosity
he
could
feel
the
eyes
boring
into
him
we
were
speaking
of
ownership
said
the
man
in
a
low
menacing
tone
i
want
to
know
where
the
woman
who
owns
this
ring
can
be
found
there
was
no
play
no
trifling
here
the
man
was
in
deadly
earnest
but
it
seemed
to
jimmie
dale
even
with
the
sense
of
peril
more
imminent
with
every
instant
that
he
could
have
laughed
outright
in
savage
mockery
at
the
irony
of
the
question
where
was
she
even
who
was
she
and
this
was
the
hour
in
which
he
was
to
have
known
may
i
look
at
it
he
requested
calmly
the
other
nodded
but
his
eyes
never
left
jimmie
dale
it
will
give
you
an
extra
moment
or
so
to
frame
your
answer
he
said
sarcastically
jimmie
dale
ignored
the
thrust
picked
up
the
ring
examined
it
deliberately
and
set
it
back
again
on
the
table
since
i
do
not
know
who
owns
it
he
said
i
can
not
answer
your
no
well
then
there
is
still
another
matter
a
little
package
that
was
in
the
taxicab
with
you
where
is
that
see
here
said
jimmie
dale
irritably
this
has
gone
far
enough
i
have
seen
no
package
large
or
small
or
of
any
description
whatever
you
are
evidently
mistaking
me
for
some
one
else
you
have
only
to
telephone
to
the
james
he
reached
toward
his
pocket
for
his
cardcase
my
name
is
dale
supplied
the
other
curtly
do
bother
about
the
card
dale
we
have
already
taken
the
liberty
of
searching
he
rose
abruptly
from
his
chair
i
am
afraid
you
do
not
quite
realise
your
position
dale
he
said
with
an
ominous
smile
let
me
make
it
clear
i
do
not
wish
to
be
theatrical
about
this
but
we
do
not
temporise
here
you
will
either
answer
both
of
those
questions
to
my
satisfaction
or
you
will
never
leave
this
place
jimmie
dale
face
hardened
his
eyes
met
the
other
steadily
ah
i
think
i
begin
to
see
he
said
caustically
when
i
have
been
thoroughly
frightened
i
shall
be
offered
my
freedom
at
a
price
a
sort
of
game
of
holdup
the
penalty
of
being
a
wealthy
man
if
you
had
named
your
figure
to
begin
with
we
would
have
saved
a
lot
of
idle
talk
and
you
would
have
had
my
answer
the
sooner
nothing
do
you
know
said
the
other
in
a
grimly
musing
way
there
has
always
been
one
man
but
only
one
until
now
that
i
have
wished
i
might
add
to
my
present
associates
i
refer
to
the
gray
seal
there
are
two
i
pay
you
the
compliment
of
being
the
other
but
he
was
smiling
ominously
again
we
are
wasting
time
dale
i
am
willing
to
expose
my
hand
to
the
extent
of
admitting
that
the
information
you
are
withholding
is
infinitely
more
valuable
to
me
than
the
mere
wreaking
of
reprisal
upon
you
for
a
refusal
to
talk
therefore
if
you
will
answer
i
pledge
you
my
word
you
will
be
free
to
leave
here
within
five
minutes
if
you
refuse
you
are
already
aware
of
the
alternative
well
dale
who
was
this
man
jimmie
dale
was
studying
the
other
chin
the
lips
the
white
even
teeth
the
hair
some
day
the
tables
might
be
turned
could
he
recognise
again
this
cool
imperturbable
ruffian
who
so
callously
threatened
him
with
murder
well
dale
i
am
waiting
i
am
not
a
magician
said
jimmie
dale
contemptuously
i
could
not
answer
your
questions
if
i
wanted
the
other
hand
slid
instantly
to
a
row
of
electric
buttons
on
the
desk
very
well
dale
he
said
quietly
you
do
not
believe
i
see
that
i
would
dare
to
carry
my
threat
into
execution
you
perhaps
even
doubt
my
power
i
shall
take
the
trouble
to
convince
you
i
imagine
it
will
stimulate
your
the
door
opened
two
men
were
standing
on
the
threshold
both
in
evening
dress
both
masked
the
man
behind
the
desk
came
forward
took
jimmie
dale
arm
almost
courteously
and
led
him
from
the
room
out
into
a
corridor
where
he
halted
abruptly
i
want
to
call
your
attention
first
dale
to
the
fact
that
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
you
neither
have
now
nor
ever
will
have
any
idea
whether
you
are
in
the
heart
of
new
york
or
fifty
miles
away
from
it
now
listen
do
you
hear
anything
there
was
nothing
only
the
strange
silence
of
that
other
room
was
intensified
now
there
was
not
a
sound
stillness
such
as
it
seemed
to
jimmie
dale
he
had
never
experienced
before
was
around
him
you
may
possibly
infer
from
the
silence
that
you
are
not
in
the
city
suggested
the
other
after
a
moment
pause
i
leave
you
to
your
own
conclusions
in
that
respect
the
cause
however
of
the
silence
is
internal
not
external
we
had
principles
in
mind
to
a
perhaps
exaggerated
degree
when
this
building
was
constructed
if
you
care
to
do
so
you
have
my
permission
to
shout
say
for
help
to
your
heart
content
we
shall
make
no
effort
to
stop
jimmie
dale
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
was
staring
down
a
brilliantly
lighted
richly
carpeted
corridor
there
were
doors
on
one
side
windows
on
the
other
the
windows
all
hung
with
heavy
closely
drawn
portieres
the
corridor
was
certainly
not
on
the
ground
floor
but
whether
it
was
on
the
second
or
third
or
even
above
that
again
he
had
no
means
of
knowing
from
appearances
though
the
place
seemed
more
like
a
large
private
mansion
than
anything
else
just
one
word
more
before
we
proceed
continued
the
other
i
do
not
wish
you
to
labour
under
any
illusion
here
we
are
frankly
criminals
this
is
our
home
it
should
have
some
effect
in
impressing
you
with
the
power
and
resource
at
our
command
and
also
with
the
class
of
men
with
whom
you
are
dealing
there
is
not
one
among
us
whose
education
is
not
fully
equal
to
your
own
not
one
indeed
but
who
is
chosen
granting
first
his
criminal
tendencies
because
he
is
a
specialist
in
his
own
particular
field
in
commerce
in
the
government
diplomatic
service
in
the
professions
of
law
and
medicine
in
the
ranks
of
pure
science
we
are
bordering
on
the
fantastical
are
we
not
dreaming
you
will
probably
say
of
the
utopian
in
crime
organisation
quite
so
dale
i
only
ask
you
to
consider
the
possibilities
if
what
i
say
is
true
now
let
us
proceed
i
am
going
to
take
you
into
three
rooms
the
three
whose
doors
you
see
ahead
of
you
you
will
notice
that
including
the
one
you
have
just
left
there
are
four
on
this
corridor
i
do
not
wish
to
strain
your
credulity
or
play
tricks
upon
you
so
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
fix
an
approximate
idea
of
the
length
of
the
corridor
in
your
mind
as
it
will
perhaps
enable
you
to
account
more
readily
for
what
may
appear
to
be
a
discrepancy
in
the
corresponding
size
of
the
one
of
the
men
opened
the
door
ahead
jimmie
dale
at
a
sign
from
his
conductor
moved
forward
and
entered
just
what
he
had
expected
to
find
he
could
not
have
told
his
brain
was
whirling
partly
from
his
aching
head
partly
from
his
desperate
effort
to
conceive
some
way
of
escape
from
the
peril
which
for
all
his
nonchalance
he
knew
only
too
well
was
the
gravest
he
had
ever
faced
but
what
he
saw
was
simply
a
cozily
furnished
bedroom
there
was
nothing
peculiar
about
it
nothing
out
of
the
way
except
perhaps
that
it
was
rather
narrow
and
then
suddenly
rubbing
his
eyes
involuntarily
he
was
staring
in
a
dazed
way
before
him
the
whole
side
of
the
wall
was
sinking
without
a
sound
into
the
floor
increasing
the
width
of
the
room
by
some
five
or
six
feet
and
in
this
space
was
disclosed
what
appeared
to
be
a
sort
of
chemical
laboratory
elaborately
equipped
extending
the
entire
length
of
the
room
the
wall
is
purely
a
matter
of
mechanical
construction
operated
the
man
was
speaking
softly
at
jimmie
dale
side
the
room
beneath
is
built
to
correspond
the
base
ceiling
and
wall
mouldings
here
do
not
have
to
be
very
ingenious
to
effect
a
disguise
i
might
say
however
that
few
visitors
other
than
yourself
have
ever
seen
anything
here
but
a
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
retorts
the
racks
of
test
tubes
the
hundred
and
one
articles
that
strewed
the
laboratory
bench
as
for
this
its
purpose
is
twofold
we
as
well
as
the
police
have
often
need
of
analysis
we
make
it
if
we
require
a
drug
a
poison
say
we
compound
it
from
its
various
ingredients
or
as
the
case
may
be
distil
it
perhaps
it
is
you
will
agree
somewhat
more
difficult
to
trace
to
its
source
if
procured
that
way
and
speaking
of
poisons
he
stepped
forward
and
lifted
a
bottle
containing
a
colourless
liquid
from
a
shelf
in
a
modest
way
we
have
even
done
some
original
research
work
here
this
for
instance
is
as
utopian
from
our
standpoint
as
the
formation
and
personnel
of
the
organisation
i
have
briefly
outlined
to
you
it
possesses
very
essential
qualities
it
is
almost
instantaneous
in
its
action
requires
a
very
small
quantity
and
defies
detection
even
by
he
uncorked
the
bottle
and
dipped
in
a
long
glass
rod
will
you
watch
the
experiment
he
invited
with
a
sort
of
ghastly
pleasantry
i
do
not
want
you
to
accept
anything
on
with
a
start
jimmie
dale
swung
around
he
had
heard
no
sound
but
another
man
was
at
his
elbow
now
and
struggling
in
the
man
hand
was
a
little
white
rabbit
it
was
over
in
an
instant
a
single
drop
in
the
rabbit
mouth
and
the
animal
had
stiffened
out
a
lifeless
thing
it
is
quite
as
effective
on
the
human
organism
continued
the
other
only
instead
of
one
drop
three
are
required
if
i
make
it
ten
he
was
carefully
measuring
the
liquid
into
two
wineglasses
it
is
only
that
even
you
may
be
satisfied
that
the
quantity
is
he
filled
up
the
glasses
with
what
was
apparently
wine
of
some
description
which
he
poured
from
a
decanter
and
held
out
the
glasses
in
front
of
him
and
again
jimmie
dale
started
again
he
had
heard
no
one
enter
and
yet
two
men
had
stepped
forward
from
behind
him
and
had
taken
the
glasses
from
their
leader
hands
he
glanced
around
him
counting
quickly
they
were
surely
the
two
who
had
entered
with
him
from
the
corridor
no
including
the
leader
there
were
now
six
men
all
in
evening
dress
all
masked
in
the
room
with
him
a
wave
of
the
leader
hand
and
the
two
men
holding
the
glasses
left
the
room
the
man
turned
to
jimmie
dale
again
shall
we
proceed
to
the
second
room
dale
he
asked
politely
i
think
it
is
now
prepared
for
us
i
do
not
wish
to
bore
you
with
a
repetition
of
magical
sliding
there
was
something
now
that
numbed
the
ache
in
jimmie
dale
brain
a
sense
of
some
deadly
remorseless
thing
that
seemed
to
be
constantly
creeping
closer
to
him
clutching
at
him
to
smother
him
to
choke
him
there
was
something
absolutely
fiendish
terrifying
in
the
veneer
of
culture
around
him
they
had
entered
the
second
room
this
like
the
other
was
a
but
here
the
movable
wall
was
already
down
ranged
along
the
side
were
a
great
number
of
cabinets
that
slid
in
and
out
much
after
the
style
and
fashion
used
by
clothing
dealers
to
stock
and
display
their
wares
these
cabinets
were
now
all
open
displaying
hundreds
of
costumes
of
all
kinds
and
descriptions
and
evidently
complete
to
the
minutest
detail
the
cabinets
were
flanked
by
mirrors
at
each
end
of
the
room
and
on
little
tables
before
the
mirrors
was
an
assortment
that
none
better
than
jimmie
dale
himself
could
appreciate
of
accessories
the
man
smiled
apologetically
i
am
afraid
this
is
rather
uninteresting
he
said
i
have
shown
it
to
you
simply
that
you
may
understand
that
we
are
alive
to
the
importance
of
detail
disguise
that
is
daily
vital
to
us
is
an
art
that
depends
essentially
on
detail
i
venture
to
say
we
could
impersonate
any
character
or
type
or
nationality
or
class
in
the
united
states
at
a
moment
notice
but
he
took
jimmie
dale
arm
again
and
conducted
him
out
into
the
corridor
while
the
two
men
who
were
evidently
acting
the
role
of
guards
followed
closely
behind
there
is
still
the
third
room
he
halted
jimmie
dale
before
the
door
i
have
asked
you
to
answer
two
questions
dale
he
said
softly
i
ask
you
now
to
remember
the
they
still
stood
before
the
door
there
was
that
uncanny
silence
again
it
seemed
to
jimmie
dale
to
last
interminably
neither
of
the
three
men
surrounding
him
moved
nor
spoke
then
the
door
before
him
was
opened
on
an
unlighted
room
and
he
was
led
across
the
threshold
he
heard
the
door
close
behind
him
the
lights
came
on
and
then
it
seemed
as
though
he
could
not
move
as
though
he
were
rooted
to
the
spot
the
colour
ebbed
from
his
face
three
figures
were
before
him
the
two
men
who
had
carried
the
glasses
from
the
first
room
and
the
chauffeur
who
had
driven
him
in
the
taxicab
the
two
men
still
held
the
glasses
the
chauffeur
was
bound
hand
and
foot
in
a
chair
one
of
the
glasses
was
empty
the
other
was
still
significantly
full
jimmie
dale
with
a
violent
effort
at
leaned
forward
the
man
in
the
chair
was
dead
chapter
iv
the
innocent
bystander
there
was
not
a
sound
that
stillness
weird
unnerving
that
permeated
as
it
were
everywhere
through
that
mysterious
house
was
if
that
were
possible
accentuated
now
the
four
masked
men
in
evening
dress
five
including
their
leader
for
the
man
who
had
appeared
in
that
other
room
with
the
rabbit
was
not
here
were
as
silent
as
motionless
as
the
dead
man
who
was
lashed
there
in
the
chair
and
to
jimmie
dale
it
seemed
at
first
as
though
his
brain
stunned
and
stupefied
at
the
shock
refused
its
functions
and
left
him
groping
blindly
vaguely
with
only
a
sort
of
dull
subconscious
realisation
of
menace
and
a
deadly
peril
imminent
hanging
over
him
he
tried
to
rouse
himself
mentally
to
prod
his
brain
to
action
to
pit
it
in
a
fight
for
life
against
these
criminals
and
murderers
with
their
mask
of
culture
who
surrounded
him
now
was
there
a
way
out
what
was
it
the
tocsin
had
said
the
most
powerful
and
pitiless
organisation
of
criminals
the
world
has
ever
known
the
stake
a
fortune
of
millions
her
life
there
had
indeed
been
no
overemphasis
in
the
words
she
had
used
they
had
taken
pains
themselves
to
make
that
ominously
clear
these
men
every
detail
of
the
strange
house
with
its
luxurious
furnishings
its
cleverly
contrived
appointments
breathed
a
horribly
suggestive
degree
of
power
a
deadly
purpose
and
an
organisation
swayed
by
a
master
mind
and
grim
evidence
of
the
merciless
inexorable
length
to
which
they
would
go
was
the
ghastly
white
face
of
the
dead
chauffeur
bound
hand
and
foot
in
the
chair
before
him
that
empty
glass
in
the
hand
of
one
of
the
men
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
it
except
as
his
eyes
were
drawn
magnetically
to
that
full
glass
in
the
hand
of
one
of
the
others
what
height
of
sardonic
irony
he
was
to
drink
that
other
glass
to
die
because
he
refused
to
answer
questions
that
for
years
with
every
resource
at
his
command
risking
his
liberty
his
wealth
his
name
his
life
with
everything
that
he
cared
for
thrown
into
the
scales
he
had
struggled
to
solve
and
failed
and
then
the
leader
spoke
mr
dale
he
said
with
cold
significance
i
regret
to
admit
that
your
pseudo
taxicab
driver
was
so
as
to
refuse
to
answer
the
same
questions
that
i
have
put
to
five
to
one
that
was
the
only
way
out
and
it
was
hopeless
it
was
the
only
way
out
because
convinced
that
he
could
answer
those
questions
if
he
wanted
to
these
men
were
in
deadly
earnest
it
was
hopeless
because
they
were
five
to
one
and
probably
there
were
as
many
more
twice
or
three
times
as
many
more
within
call
but
what
did
it
matter
how
many
more
there
were
he
could
fight
until
he
was
overpowered
that
was
all
he
could
do
and
the
five
could
accomplish
that
still
if
he
could
knock
the
full
glass
out
of
that
man
hand
and
gain
the
door
then
perhaps
he
turned
quickly
as
the
door
opened
it
was
as
though
they
had
read
his
thoughts
a
number
of
men
were
grouped
outside
in
the
corridor
then
the
door
closed
again
with
a
cordon
ranged
against
it
inside
the
room
and
at
the
same
instant
his
arms
and
wrists
were
caught
in
a
powerful
grasp
by
the
two
men
immediately
behind
him
who
all
along
had
enacted
the
role
of
guards
again
the
leader
spoke
i
will
repeat
the
questions
he
said
sharply
where
is
the
woman
whose
ring
was
found
on
that
man
there
in
the
chair
and
where
is
the
package
that
you
two
men
had
with
you
in
the
taxicab
jimmie
dale
glanced
from
the
tall
straight
immaculately
clothed
figure
of
the
speaker
from
the
threatening
smile
on
the
set
lips
that
just
showed
under
the
edge
of
the
mask
to
the
dead
man
in
the
chair
he
had
faced
the
prospect
of
death
before
many
times
but
it
had
come
with
the
heat
of
passion
accompanying
it
it
had
come
quickly
abruptly
with
every
faculty
called
into
action
to
combat
it
without
time
to
dwell
upon
it
to
sift
weigh
or
measure
its
meaning
and
if
there
had
been
fear
it
had
been
subordinate
to
other
emotions
but
it
was
different
now
he
could
not
of
course
answer
those
questions
nor
he
was
doggedly
conscious
would
he
have
answered
them
if
he
could
and
there
was
no
middle
course
death
within
the
next
few
moments
stared
him
in
the
face
and
it
seemed
curiously
irrelevant
that
in
a
sort
of
unnatural
calmness
he
should
be
attempting
to
analyse
his
feelings
and
emotions
concerning
it
all
his
life
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
the
acme
of
human
mental
torture
was
the
cell
of
a
condemned
criminal
with
the
horror
of
its
hopelessness
with
the
time
to
dwell
upon
it
and
that
the
acme
of
that
torture
itself
must
be
that
awful
moment
immediately
preceding
execution
when
anticipation
at
last
was
to
merge
into
reality
strange
that
thought
should
come
strange
that
he
should
be
framing
a
brain
picture
of
such
a
scene
vivid
minute
in
detail
no
not
strange
he
was
picturing
himself
the
analogy
was
not
perfect
it
was
true
he
had
not
had
the
months
weeks
days
and
hours
of
suspense
but
it
was
perfect
enough
to
bring
home
to
him
with
appalling
force
the
realisation
of
his
position
he
was
standing
as
a
condemned
man
might
stand
in
those
last
final
moments
those
moments
which
he
had
imagined
must
be
the
most
terrible
that
could
exist
in
life
but
that
dismay
of
soul
the
horror
the
terror
were
not
his
there
was
instead
a
smouldering
fury
a
passionate
amazement
that
it
was
his
own
life
that
was
threatened
it
seemed
impossible
that
it
could
be
his
voice
that
was
speaking
now
in
such
quiet
measured
tones
is
it
worth
while
will
it
convince
you
now
any
more
than
before
to
repeat
that
there
is
some
mistake
here
i
am
no
more
able
to
answer
your
questions
than
you
are
yourselves
i
never
saw
that
man
in
the
chair
there
in
my
life
until
the
moment
that
i
hailed
him
in
his
cab
i
do
not
know
who
the
woman
is
to
whom
that
ring
belongs
much
less
do
i
know
where
she
is
and
if
there
was
a
package
of
any
sort
in
the
taxicab
as
you
state
i
never
saw
the
lips
under
the
mask
curved
into
a
lupine
smile
think
well
dale
the
man
voice
was
low
menacing
ethically
if
you
so
choose
to
consider
it
your
refusal
may
be
the
act
of
a
brave
man
practically
it
is
the
act
of
a
fool
now
your
answer
i
have
answered
you
said
jimmie
dale
and
relaxing
the
muscles
in
his
arms
let
them
hang
limply
for
an
instant
in
the
grip
of
the
two
men
behind
him
i
have
no
other
it
was
only
a
sign
a
motion
of
the
leader
hand
but
with
it
quick
as
a
lightning
flash
jimmie
dale
was
in
action
the
limp
arms
tautened
into
steel
as
he
wrenched
them
loose
and
whirling
around
he
whipped
his
fist
to
the
chin
of
one
of
the
two
guards
in
an
instant
with
the
blow
as
the
man
staggered
backward
the
room
was
in
pandemonium
there
was
a
rush
from
the
door
and
two
three
four
leaping
forms
hurled
themselves
upon
jimmie
dale
he
shook
them
off
and
they
came
again
there
was
no
chance
ultimately
he
knew
that
it
was
only
the
elemental
within
him
that
rose
in
fierce
revolt
at
the
thought
of
tame
submission
that
bade
him
sell
his
life
as
dearly
as
he
could
panting
gasping
for
breath
dragging
them
by
sheer
strength
as
they
clung
to
him
he
got
his
back
to
the
wall
fighting
with
the
savage
fury
and
abandon
of
a
wild
cat
but
it
could
not
last
where
one
man
went
down
before
him
two
remorselessly
appeared
the
room
seemed
filled
with
men
they
poured
in
through
the
door
he
laughed
at
them
in
a
way
more
and
more
of
them
came
there
was
no
play
for
his
arms
no
room
to
fight
they
seemed
so
close
around
him
so
many
of
them
upon
him
that
he
could
not
breathe
and
he
was
bending
being
crushed
down
as
by
an
intolerable
weight
and
then
his
feet
were
jerked
from
beneath
him
he
crashed
to
the
floor
and
in
another
moment
bound
hand
and
foot
he
was
tied
into
a
chair
beside
that
other
chair
whose
grim
occupant
sat
in
such
ghastly
apathy
of
the
scene
the
room
cleared
instantly
of
all
but
the
original
five
his
head
was
drawn
suddenly
violently
backward
and
clamped
in
that
position
and
a
metal
instrument
forced
into
his
mouth
while
his
lips
bled
in
their
resistance
pried
jaws
apart
and
held
them
open
one
drop
the
leader
ordered
curtly
the
man
with
the
full
glass
bent
over
him
and
dipped
a
glass
rod
into
the
liquid
the
drop
glistened
a
ruby
red
on
the
end
of
the
rod
and
fell
with
a
sharp
acrid
burning
sensation
upon
jimmie
dale
tongue
for
a
moment
jimmie
dale
animation
mental
and
physical
seemed
swept
away
from
him
in
as
it
were
a
hiatus
of
hideous
suspense
what
was
it
to
be
like
this
passing
why
did
it
not
act
at
once
as
it
had
acted
on
the
rabbit
they
had
showed
him
in
the
other
room
yes
he
remembered
it
took
more
than
one
drop
for
a
man
and
besides
this
was
diluted
one
drop
had
no
effect
on
a
man
it
required
good
god
one
drop
even
of
this
was
enough
he
strained
forward
in
the
chair
until
the
sweat
in
great
beads
sprang
from
his
forehead
strained
and
fought
and
tore
at
his
bonds
in
a
paroxysm
of
madness
to
free
himself
while
there
still
remained
a
little
strength
there
was
something
filming
before
his
eyes
a
numbed
feeling
was
creeping
through
his
limbs
robbing
them
sapping
them
of
their
vitality
and
power
he
felt
himself
slipping
away
into
a
state
of
utter
weakness
and
his
brain
began
to
grow
confused
a
voice
seemed
to
float
in
the
air
near
him
for
the
last
time
will
you
answer
with
a
supreme
effort
jimmie
dale
strove
to
rally
his
tottering
senses
did
they
not
understand
the
stupendous
mockery
of
their
questions
did
they
not
understand
that
he
did
not
know
he
had
told
them
so
perhaps
he
had
better
tell
them
so
again
i
he
tried
to
speak
and
found
the
words
thick
upon
his
tongue
i
do
not
the
glass
itself
was
thrust
abruptly
between
his
lips
some
of
the
contents
spilled
and
trickled
upon
his
chin
and
then
a
flood
of
it
burning
fiery
poured
down
his
throat
a
flood
of
it
and
it
needed
but
three
drops
and
there
had
been
ten
in
the
glass
so
this
was
death
a
hazy
nebulous
thing
there
was
no
pain
it
was
like
like
nothingness
and
out
of
the
nothingness
she
came
strange
that
she
should
come
alone
she
had
fought
these
fiends
and
outwitted
them
for
how
long
was
it
three
years
she
would
be
more
than
ever
alone
now
pray
god
she
did
not
finally
fall
into
their
clutches
how
it
burned
now
that
fatal
draught
they
had
forced
down
his
throat
and
how
it
gripped
at
him
and
seemed
to
eat
and
bore
its
way
into
the
very
tissues
it
was
the
end
and
no
it
was
stimulating
him
strength
seemed
to
be
returning
to
his
limbs
it
seemed
as
though
he
were
being
carried
as
though
the
bonds
about
him
were
being
loosened
and
now
his
brain
seemed
to
be
growing
clearer
he
roused
up
with
a
startled
exclamation
he
was
back
in
the
same
room
in
which
he
had
first
returned
to
consciousness
after
the
accident
he
was
on
the
same
couch
the
same
masked
figure
was
at
the
same
desk
had
he
been
dreaming
was
this
then
only
some
horrible
ghastly
nightmare
through
which
he
had
passed
no
it
had
been
real
enough
his
clothes
rent
and
torn
and
the
blood
upon
his
hands
where
the
skin
had
been
scraped
from
his
knuckles
in
the
fight
bore
evidence
to
that
he
must
then
have
lost
consciousness
for
a
while
though
it
seemed
to
him
that
at
no
moment
hazy
irrational
though
his
brain
might
have
been
had
he
become
entirely
oblivious
to
what
was
taking
place
around
him
and
yet
it
must
have
been
so
the
eyes
from
behind
the
mask
were
fixed
steadily
upon
him
and
below
the
mask
there
was
the
hard
unpleasant
set
to
the
lips
that
jimmie
dale
had
grown
accustomed
to
expect
the
man
spoke
abruptly
that
you
find
yourself
alive
dale
he
said
grimly
is
no
confession
of
weakness
upon
the
part
of
those
with
whom
you
have
had
to
deal
here
to
bear
witness
to
that
there
is
one
who
is
not
alive
as
you
have
seen
that
man
we
knew
with
you
it
was
somewhat
different
your
presence
in
the
taxicab
was
only
suspicious
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
you
might
be
one
of
those
ubiquitous
bystanders
your
name
your
position
the
improbability
that
you
could
have
anything
in
common
with
shall
we
say
the
matter
that
so
deeply
interests
us
was
all
in
your
favour
however
presumption
and
probability
are
the
tools
of
fools
we
do
not
depend
upon
them
we
apply
the
test
and
having
applied
the
test
we
are
convinced
that
you
have
told
the
truth
that
is
he
rose
from
his
chair
brusquely
i
shall
not
apologise
to
you
for
what
has
happened
i
doubt
very
much
if
you
are
in
a
frame
of
mind
to
accept
anything
of
the
sort
i
imagine
rather
that
you
are
promising
yourself
that
we
shall
pay
and
pay
dearly
for
this
that
among
other
things
we
shall
answer
for
the
murder
of
that
man
in
the
other
room
all
this
will
be
quite
within
your
province
dale
and
quite
fruitless
morning
the
story
that
you
are
preparing
to
tell
now
would
sound
incredible
even
in
your
own
ears
furthermore
as
we
shall
take
pains
to
see
that
you
leave
this
place
with
as
little
knowledge
of
its
location
as
you
obtained
when
you
arrived
your
story
even
if
believed
would
do
little
service
to
you
and
less
harm
to
us
i
think
of
nothing
more
dale
except
there
was
a
whimsical
smile
on
the
lips
now
ah
yes
the
matter
of
your
clothes
we
can
and
shall
be
glad
to
make
reparation
to
you
to
the
slight
extent
of
offering
you
a
new
suit
before
you
jimmie
dale
scowled
sick
shaken
and
weak
as
he
was
the
cool
imperturbable
impudence
of
the
man
was
fast
growing
unbearable
the
man
laughed
i
am
sure
you
will
not
refuse
dale
since
we
insist
the
condition
of
the
clothes
you
have
on
at
present
might
i
say
in
a
measure
support
your
story
with
some
degree
of
tangible
evidence
it
is
not
at
all
likely
of
course
but
we
prefer
to
discount
even
so
remote
a
possibility
when
you
have
changed
you
will
be
motored
back
to
your
home
i
bid
you
jimmie
dale
rubbed
his
eyes
the
man
was
gone
through
a
door
at
the
rear
of
the
desk
a
door
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
that
was
not
even
in
evidence
now
that
was
simply
a
movable
section
of
the
wall
panelling
and
for
an
instant
jimmie
dale
experienced
a
sense
of
sickening
impotence
it
was
as
though
he
stood
defenceless
unarmed
and
utterly
at
the
mercy
of
some
venomous
power
that
could
crush
what
it
would
remorselessly
and
at
will
in
its
might
the
place
was
a
veritable
maze
a
lair
of
hellish
cleverness
he
had
no
illusions
now
he
laboured
under
no
false
estimate
of
either
the
ingenuity
or
the
resources
of
this
inhuman
nest
of
vultures
to
whom
murder
was
no
more
than
a
matter
of
detail
and
it
was
against
these
men
that
henceforth
he
was
to
match
his
wits
there
could
be
no
truce
no
armistice
it
was
their
lives
or
hers
or
his
well
he
was
alive
now
the
first
round
was
over
and
so
far
he
had
won
his
brows
furrowed
suddenly
had
he
he
was
not
so
sure
after
all
he
was
conscious
of
a
disquieting
premonitory
intuition
that
in
some
way
which
he
could
not
explain
the
honours
were
not
entirely
his
he
was
apparently
the
apparently
was
a
mental
reservation
quite
alone
in
the
room
he
got
up
from
the
couch
and
walked
shakily
across
the
floor
to
the
desk
a
revolver
lay
invitingly
upon
the
blotting
pad
it
was
his
own
the
one
they
had
taken
from
him
after
the
accident
jimmie
dale
picked
it
up
examined
it
and
smiled
a
little
sarcastically
at
himself
for
his
trouble
it
was
unloaded
of
course
he
was
twirling
it
in
his
hand
as
a
man
masked
as
every
one
in
the
house
was
masked
and
carrying
a
neatly
folded
suit
over
his
arm
entered
from
the
corridor
the
car
is
ready
as
soon
as
you
are
dressed
announced
the
other
briefly
he
laid
the
clothes
upon
the
couch
and
settled
himself
significantly
in
a
chair
jimmie
dale
hesitated
then
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
recrossed
the
room
and
began
to
remove
his
torn
garments
what
was
the
use
they
would
certainly
have
their
own
way
in
the
end
it
was
worth
another
fight
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
a
refusal
except
to
offer
a
sop
to
his
own
exasperation
he
dressed
quickly
in
what
proved
to
be
an
exceedingly
suit
and
finally
turned
tentatively
to
the
man
in
the
chair
the
other
stood
up
and
produced
a
heavy
black
silk
scarf
if
you
have
no
objections
he
said
curtly
i
tie
this
over
your
again
jimmie
dale
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
am
glad
enough
to
get
out
on
any
conditions
he
answered
caustically
would
be
the
better
word
rejoined
the
other
meaningly
and
deftly
knotting
the
scarf
led
jimmie
dale
blindfolded
from
the
room
chapter
v
on
guard
was
he
in
the
city
in
a
suburban
town
on
a
country
road
it
seemed
childishly
absurd
that
he
could
not
at
least
differentiate
to
that
extent
and
yet
from
the
moment
he
had
been
placed
in
the
automobile
in
which
he
now
found
himself
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
he
could
not
tell
he
had
started
out
with
the
belief
that
knowing
new
york
and
its
surroundings
as
minutely
as
he
knew
them
it
would
be
impossible
do
what
they
would
to
prevent
it
that
at
the
end
of
the
journey
he
should
be
without
a
clew
and
a
very
good
clew
at
that
to
the
location
of
what
he
now
called
appropriately
enough
it
seemed
the
crime
club
but
he
had
never
ridden
blindfolded
in
a
car
before
he
could
see
absolutely
nothing
and
if
that
increased
or
accentuated
his
sense
of
hearing
it
helped
little
the
roar
of
the
racing
car
beat
upon
his
eardrums
the
more
heavily
that
was
all
he
could
tell
of
course
the
nature
of
the
roadbed
they
were
running
on
an
asphalt
road
that
was
obvious
enough
but
city
streets
and
suburban
streets
and
hundreds
of
miles
of
country
road
around
new
york
were
of
asphalt
traffic
he
was
quite
sure
for
he
had
strained
his
ears
in
an
effort
to
detect
it
that
there
was
little
or
no
traffic
but
then
it
must
be
one
or
two
in
the
morning
and
at
that
hour
the
city
streets
certainly
those
that
would
be
chosen
by
these
men
would
be
quite
as
deserted
as
any
country
road
and
as
for
a
sense
of
direction
he
had
none
whatever
even
if
the
car
had
not
been
persistently
swerving
and
changing
its
course
every
little
while
if
he
had
been
able
to
form
even
an
approximate
idea
of
the
compass
direction
in
which
they
had
started
he
might
possibly
have
been
able
in
a
general
way
to
counteract
this
further
effort
of
theirs
to
confuse
him
but
without
the
initial
direction
he
was
essentially
befogged
with
these
conclusions
finally
thrust
home
upon
him
jimmie
dale
philosophically
subordinated
the
matter
in
his
mind
and
leaning
back
composed
himself
as
comfortably
as
he
could
upon
his
seat
there
was
a
man
beside
him
and
he
could
feel
the
legs
of
two
men
on
the
seat
facing
him
these
with
the
driver
would
make
four
he
was
still
well
guarded
the
car
itself
was
a
closed
car
not
hooded
the
sense
of
touch
told
him
therefore
a
limousine
of
some
description
these
facts
in
a
sense
inconsequential
were
absorbed
subconsciously
and
then
jimmie
brain
remorselessly
active
in
spite
of
the
pain
from
his
throbbing
head
was
at
work
again
it
seemed
as
though
a
year
had
passed
since
in
the
early
evening
as
larry
the
bat
he
had
burrowed
so
ironically
for
refuge
in
chang
den
from
her
it
seemed
like
some
mocking
unreality
some
visionary
dream
that
so
short
a
while
before
he
had
read
those
words
of
hers
that
had
sent
the
blood
coursing
and
leaping
through
his
veins
in
mad
exultation
at
the
thought
that
the
culmination
of
the
years
had
come
that
all
he
longed
for
hoped
for
that
all
his
soul
cried
out
for
was
to
be
his
in
an
an
hour
and
he
was
to
have
seen
her
the
woman
whose
face
he
had
never
seen
the
woman
whom
he
loved
and
the
hour
instead
the
hours
since
then
had
brought
a
nightmare
of
events
so
incredible
as
to
seem
but
phantoms
of
the
imagination
phantoms
he
sat
up
suddenly
with
a
jerk
the
face
of
the
dead
chauffeur
the
limp
form
lashed
in
that
chair
the
horrible
picture
in
its
entirety
every
detail
standing
out
in
ghastly
relief
took
form
before
him
god
knew
there
was
no
phantom
there
the
man
beside
him
at
the
sudden
start
lifted
a
hand
and
felt
hurriedly
over
the
bandage
across
jimmie
dale
eyes
jimmie
dale
was
scarcely
conscious
of
the
act
with
that
face
before
him
with
the
scene
itself
in
his
mind
again
had
come
another
thought
staggering
him
for
a
moment
with
the
new
menace
that
it
brought
he
had
had
neither
time
nor
opportunity
to
think
before
it
had
been
all
horror
all
shock
when
he
had
entered
that
room
but
now
like
an
inspiration
he
saw
it
all
from
another
angle
there
was
a
glaring
fallacy
in
the
game
these
men
had
played
for
his
benefit
a
fallacy
which
they
had
counted
on
glossing
over
as
it
had
indeed
been
glossed
over
by
the
sudden
shock
with
which
they
had
forced
that
scene
upon
him
or
failing
in
that
they
had
counted
on
the
fact
that
his
or
any
other
man
nerve
would
have
failed
when
it
came
to
open
defiance
based
on
a
supposition
which
might
after
all
be
wrong
and
being
wrong
meant
death
but
it
was
not
supposition
either
he
was
right
now
or
these
men
were
childish
immature
fools
and
whatever
else
they
might
be
they
were
not
that
not
a
single
drop
of
poison
had
passed
the
chauffeur
lips
the
man
had
not
been
murdered
in
that
room
he
had
not
in
a
sense
been
murdered
at
all
the
man
absolutely
unquestionably
without
a
loophole
for
doubt
had
either
been
killed
outright
in
the
automobile
accident
or
had
died
immediately
afterward
probably
without
regaining
consciousness
certainly
without
supplying
any
of
the
information
that
was
so
determinedly
sought
yes
he
saw
it
now
their
backs
were
against
the
wall
they
were
at
their
wits
end
these
men
the
knowledge
that
the
chauffeur
possessed
that
they
knew
he
possessed
was
evidently
life
and
death
to
them
to
kill
the
man
before
they
had
wormed
out
of
him
what
they
wanted
to
know
or
at
least
until
by
holding
him
a
prisoner
they
had
exhausted
every
means
at
their
command
to
make
him
speak
was
the
last
thing
they
would
do
jimmie
dale
sat
for
a
long
time
quite
motionless
the
car
was
speeding
at
a
terrific
rate
along
a
straight
stretch
of
road
he
could
almost
have
sworn
guided
by
some
intuitive
sense
that
they
were
in
the
country
well
even
if
it
were
so
what
did
that
prove
they
might
have
started
from
new
york
itself
only
to
return
to
it
when
they
had
satisfied
themselves
that
he
was
sufficiently
duped
or
they
might
have
started
legitimately
from
outside
new
york
and
be
going
toward
the
city
now
since
the
ultimate
destination
was
new
york
and
they
had
made
no
attempt
to
hide
that
from
him
it
was
useless
to
speculate
for
at
best
it
could
be
only
speculation
he
had
decided
that
once
before
the
man
at
his
side
felt
again
over
the
scarf
to
see
that
it
was
in
place
curiously
now
jimmie
dale
recalled
the
inward
monitor
that
had
warned
him
the
honours
had
not
all
been
his
in
this
first
round
with
the
crime
club
if
they
had
deliberately
murdered
the
chauffeur
because
of
a
refusal
to
answer
they
would
equally
have
done
the
same
to
him
fool
that
he
had
been
not
to
have
seen
that
before
and
yet
would
it
have
made
any
difference
he
shook
his
head
he
could
not
have
acted
to
any
better
advantage
than
he
had
done
he
could
not
his
lips
curled
in
grim
derision
have
been
any
more
convincing
convincing
it
was
all
clear
enough
now
if
the
chauffeur
had
suffered
death
rather
than
talk
even
admitting
the
fact
that
they
had
more
grounds
for
suspecting
the
chauffeur
complicity
would
his
jimmie
dale
mere
denial
his
choice
too
of
death
have
been
any
the
more
convincing
or
have
saved
his
life
where
it
had
not
saved
the
other
a
certain
added
respect
for
these
men
against
whom
until
the
end
now
his
victory
or
theirs
he
realised
he
was
fighting
for
his
life
came
over
him
as
he
recognised
the
touch
of
a
master
hand
they
did
not
know
where
to
find
the
tocsin
the
package
that
she
had
said
was
vital
to
them
was
still
beyond
their
reach
the
chauffeur
was
dead
and
he
jimmie
dale
alone
remained
a
clew
that
they
had
still
to
prove
valid
or
invalid
it
was
true
but
the
only
clew
in
their
possession
and
gaining
nothing
from
him
by
a
show
of
force
to
throw
him
off
his
guard
they
had
let
him
go
meaning
him
to
believe
they
were
convinced
he
knew
nothing
and
that
the
episode
the
adventure
of
the
night
was
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
ended
finished
and
done
with
time
passed
a
very
long
time
as
he
sat
there
it
might
have
been
an
hour
he
could
only
hazard
a
guess
not
one
of
the
men
in
the
car
had
spoken
a
word
but
to
jimmie
dale
the
car
itself
the
ride
its
duration
these
three
strange
companions
were
for
the
time
being
extraneous
even
that
sick
giddiness
in
his
head
had
at
least
temporarily
gone
from
him
and
so
all
unsuspectingly
he
was
to
lead
them
to
the
tocsin
and
fall
into
the
trap
himself
his
hands
thrust
deep
in
his
pockets
were
tightly
clenched
they
were
clever
enough
ingenious
enough
powerful
enough
to
watch
him
henceforth
at
every
turn
and
from
now
on
day
and
night
they
were
to
be
reckoned
with
suppose
that
in
some
way
as
it
might
well
have
happened
for
it
was
now
vitally
necessary
that
she
should
communicate
with
him
and
he
with
her
he
had
played
blindly
into
their
hands
and
through
him
she
should
have
fallen
into
their
power
it
brought
a
sickening
chill
a
sort
of
hideous
panic
to
jimmie
dale
and
then
fury
anger
in
a
torrent
surged
upon
him
and
there
came
a
merciless
desire
to
crush
to
strangle
to
stamp
out
this
inhuman
band
of
criminals
that
with
intolerable
effrontery
to
the
laws
of
god
and
man
were
so
elaborately
and
scientifically
equipped
for
their
monstrous
purposes
and
then
jimmie
dale
in
the
darkness
smiled
again
grimly
as
the
leader
reference
to
the
gray
seal
recurred
to
him
well
perhaps
who
knew
they
would
have
reason
more
than
they
dreamed
of
to
wish
the
gray
seal
enrolled
in
their
own
ranks
it
was
strange
curious
he
had
thought
all
that
was
ended
only
a
few
short
hours
before
he
had
hidden
away
all
everything
that
was
incident
to
the
life
of
the
gray
seal
the
clothes
of
larry
the
bat
that
little
metal
case
with
the
adhesive
seals
a
dozen
other
things
believing
that
it
only
remained
for
him
to
return
and
destroy
them
at
his
leisure
as
a
finishing
touch
to
the
gray
seal
career
and
now
instead
he
was
face
to
face
with
the
gravest
and
most
dangerous
problem
that
she
had
ever
called
upon
him
to
undertake
well
at
least
the
odds
were
not
all
in
the
crime
club
favour
where
they
now
certainly
believed
him
to
be
entirely
off
his
guard
he
was
thoroughly
on
his
guard
and
where
they
might
suspect
him
watch
him
they
would
suspect
and
watch
only
the
character
the
person
of
jimmie
dale
and
count
not
at
all
upon
either
larry
the
bat
or
the
gray
seal
a
sort
of
savage
elation
fell
upon
jimmie
dale
his
brain
that
had
been
stagnant
confused
physically
sick
with
pain
and
suffering
was
working
now
with
its
vigour
and
ease
mapping
planning
scheming
the
way
ahead
to
strike
and
strike
quickly
to
strike
first
it
must
be
his
move
next
not
theirs
and
he
must
act
at
once
the
moment
he
was
given
this
pretence
to
liberty
that
they
had
in
store
for
him
before
they
had
an
opportunity
of
closing
down
around
him
with
a
network
of
spies
that
he
could
not
elude
by
morning
jimmie
dale
would
be
larry
the
bat
and
inhabiting
the
sanctuary
again
and
a
tip
to
jason
his
old
butler
to
the
effect
say
that
he
had
gone
away
for
a
trip
would
account
for
his
disappearance
satisfactorily
enough
it
would
not
necessarily
arouse
their
suspicions
when
they
eventually
discovered
he
was
gone
for
against
that
was
always
the
possible
and
quite
likely
presumption
that
where
they
had
succeeded
in
nothing
else
they
had
at
least
succeeded
in
frightening
him
thoroughly
and
to
the
extent
of
imbuing
him
with
a
hasty
desire
to
put
a
safe
distance
between
himself
and
them
and
now
with
his
mind
made
up
to
his
course
of
action
an
intense
impatience
to
put
his
plan
into
effect
an
irritation
at
the
useless
twistings
and
turnings
of
the
car
that
had
latterly
become
more
frequent
took
hold
upon
him
how
much
longer
was
this
to
last
they
must
have
been
fully
an
hour
and
a
half
on
the
road
already
and
ah
the
car
was
stopping
now
he
straightened
up
in
his
seat
as
the
machine
came
to
a
halt
but
the
man
at
his
side
laid
a
restraining
hand
upon
him
the
car
door
opened
and
one
of
the
men
got
out
jimmie
dale
caught
an
indistinct
murmur
of
voices
from
without
then
the
man
returned
to
his
seat
and
the
car
went
on
again
another
half
hour
passed
that
curbing
his
irritation
and
impatience
was
filled
with
the
conjectures
and
questions
that
anew
came
crowding
in
upon
his
mind
why
had
the
car
made
that
stop
it
was
rather
curious
it
was
certainly
a
prearranged
meeting
place
why
and
these
clothes
that
he
now
wore
why
had
they
made
him
change
his
own
had
not
been
very
badly
torn
the
reason
given
him
was
on
the
face
of
it
now
in
view
of
what
he
now
knew
mere
pretence
what
was
the
ulterior
motive
behind
that
pretence
what
did
this
package
that
had
already
cost
a
man
his
life
contain
who
was
the
chauffeur
what
was
this
death
feud
between
the
tocsin
and
these
men
did
she
know
where
the
crime
club
was
who
and
where
was
john
johansson
what
was
this
box
that
was
numbered
could
she
supply
the
links
that
would
forge
the
chain
into
an
unbroken
whole
and
then
for
the
second
time
the
car
slowed
down
and
this
time
the
man
on
the
seat
beside
jimmie
dale
reached
up
and
untied
the
scarf
you
get
out
here
said
the
man
tersely
chapter
vi
the
trap
had
it
not
been
for
the
stop
the
car
had
previously
made
for
the
possibility
that
he
might
have
obtained
a
glimpse
outside
when
the
door
had
been
opened
the
scarf
over
his
eyes
would
have
been
superfluous
for
now
with
it
removed
he
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
forms
of
the
three
men
around
him
since
the
window
curtains
of
the
car
were
tightly
drawn
nor
was
he
given
the
opportunity
to
do
more
even
had
it
been
possible
the
car
stopped
the
door
was
opened
he
was
pushed
toward
it
and
even
as
he
reached
the
ground
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
and
the
car
was
speeding
on
again
but
where
he
could
not
see
before
it
took
now
but
a
glance
to
obtain
his
bearings
he
was
standing
on
a
corner
on
riverside
drive
within
a
few
doors
of
his
own
house
jimmie
dale
stood
still
for
a
moment
watching
the
car
as
it
disappeared
rapidly
up
the
drive
and
with
a
sort
of
grim
facetiousness
his
brain
began
to
correlate
time
and
distance
where
had
he
come
from
where
was
this
crime
club
they
had
been
as
nearly
as
he
could
estimate
two
hours
in
making
the
journey
and
as
nearly
as
he
could
estimate
in
their
turnings
and
twistings
had
covered
at
least
twice
the
distance
that
would
be
represented
by
a
direct
route
granting
then
an
average
speed
of
forty
miles
an
hour
which
was
overgenerous
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
the
fact
that
they
certainly
had
not
crossed
the
hudson
which
now
lay
before
him
flanking
the
drive
the
crime
club
was
somewhere
within
the
area
of
a
semicircle
whose
centre
was
the
corner
on
which
he
now
stood
and
whose
radius
was
forty
miles
or
forty
yards
he
forced
a
laugh
it
was
just
that
no
more
no
less
he
was
as
likely
to
have
started
on
his
ride
from
within
a
biscuit
throw
of
where
he
now
stood
as
to
have
started
on
it
from
miles
away
but
he
aroused
himself
with
a
start
he
was
wasting
time
it
must
be
very
late
near
morning
and
he
would
have
need
for
every
moment
that
was
left
between
now
and
daylight
he
turned
walked
quickly
to
his
house
mounted
the
steps
and
with
his
they
had
at
least
permitted
him
to
retain
the
contents
of
his
pockets
when
they
had
forced
him
to
change
his
clothes
opened
the
front
door
softly
and
stepping
inside
closed
the
door
as
silently
as
he
had
opened
it
he
paused
for
an
instant
to
listen
there
was
not
a
sound
the
servants
naturally
would
have
been
in
bed
hours
ago
even
old
jason
jimmie
dale
smiled
half
whimsically
half
affectionately
whose
paternal
custom
it
was
to
sit
up
for
his
master
jim
who
as
he
was
fond
of
saying
he
had
dandled
as
a
baby
on
his
knee
had
evidently
given
it
up
as
a
bad
job
on
this
occasion
and
had
turned
in
himself
jason
however
had
left
the
light
burning
here
in
the
big
reception
hall
jimmie
dale
stepped
to
the
switch
and
turned
off
the
light
then
stood
hesitant
in
the
darkness
was
there
anything
to
be
gained
by
rousing
jason
now
and
telling
him
what
he
intended
to
do
to
instruct
him
to
answer
any
inquiries
by
the
statement
that
mr
dale
had
gone
away
for
a
trip
he
could
trust
jason
jason
already
knew
much
more
than
one
of
those
mysterious
letters
of
the
tocsin
had
passed
through
hands
jimmie
dale
shook
his
head
no
he
could
communicate
with
jason
from
downtown
in
the
morning
he
had
half
expected
to
find
jason
up
and
in
that
case
would
have
taken
the
other
as
far
as
necessary
into
his
confidence
but
it
was
not
a
matter
that
pressed
for
the
moment
he
could
get
into
touch
with
jason
at
any
time
readily
enough
was
there
anything
else
before
he
went
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
back
as
easily
as
he
got
out
money
he
shook
his
head
again
a
little
grimly
this
time
he
had
been
caught
once
before
as
larry
the
bat
without
funds
there
was
plenty
of
money
now
hidden
in
the
sanctuary
enough
for
any
emergency
enough
to
last
him
indefinitely
he
stepped
forward
along
the
hall
his
tread
noiseless
on
the
rich
heavy
rug
passed
into
the
rear
of
the
house
descended
the
back
stairs
and
reached
the
cellar
it
was
below
the
level
of
the
ground
of
course
but
a
narrow
window
here
though
quite
large
enough
to
permit
of
egress
gave
on
the
driveway
at
the
side
of
the
house
that
led
to
the
garage
in
the
rear
cautiously
now
for
the
cement
flooring
was
in
the
stillness
little
less
than
a
sounding
board
jimmie
dale
reached
the
wall
and
felt
along
it
to
the
window
the
lower
edge
of
whose
sill
was
just
slightly
below
the
level
of
his
shoulder
it
opened
inward
if
he
remembered
correctly
his
fingers
were
feeling
for
the
fastenings
it
was
too
dark
to
see
a
thing
he
muttered
in
annoyance
where
were
the
fastenings
at
the
sides
or
at
the
bottom
his
hand
began
to
make
a
circuit
of
the
sill
and
then
suddenly
with
a
low
sharp
cry
he
leaned
forward
what
did
this
mean
wires
no
wires
had
ever
been
there
before
his
fingers
were
working
now
with
feverish
haste
telegraphing
their
message
to
his
brain
the
wires
ran
through
the
sill
close
to
the
corner
of
the
wall
tiny
fragments
of
wood
as
from
an
auger
were
still
on
the
sill
and
here
was
a
small
particle
of
wire
insulation
that
those
sensitive
finger
tips
proclaimed
was
fresh
a
cold
thrill
ran
through
jimmie
dale
and
there
came
again
that
sickening
sense
of
impotency
in
the
face
of
the
malignant
devilish
cunning
arrayed
against
him
that
once
before
he
had
experienced
that
night
he
had
thought
to
forestall
them
and
he
had
been
forestalled
himself
this
could
only
have
been
done
they
had
had
no
interest
in
him
before
then
while
they
held
him
at
the
crime
club
while
he
was
spending
that
two
hours
in
the
car
was
that
why
they
had
taken
so
long
in
coming
was
that
why
the
car
had
stopped
that
time
that
those
with
him
might
be
told
that
the
work
here
had
been
completed
and
he
need
no
longer
be
kept
away
he
edged
away
from
the
window
and
as
cautiously
as
he
had
come
retraced
his
steps
across
the
cellar
and
up
the
stairs
and
then
the
possibility
of
being
heard
from
without
gone
he
broke
into
a
run
there
was
no
need
to
wonder
long
what
those
wires
meant
they
could
mean
only
one
of
two
things
and
the
crime
club
would
have
little
concern
in
his
electric
light
they
had
tapped
his
telephone
the
mains
he
knew
ran
into
the
cellar
from
the
underground
service
in
the
street
he
was
racing
like
a
madman
now
how
long
ago
how
many
hours
ago
had
they
done
that
great
scott
she
was
to
have
telephoned
had
she
done
so
was
the
game
all
everything
she
herself
at
their
mercy
already
if
she
had
telephoned
jason
would
have
left
a
message
on
his
desk
he
would
look
there
first
afterward
he
would
waken
jason
he
gained
the
door
of
his
den
on
the
first
landing
a
room
that
ran
the
entire
length
of
one
side
of
the
house
from
front
to
rear
burst
in
switched
on
the
light
stood
in
amazement
jason
he
cried
out
the
old
butler
fully
dressed
rubbing
and
blinking
his
eyes
at
the
light
and
with
a
startled
cry
rose
up
from
the
depths
of
a
lounging
chair
jason
exclaimed
jimmie
dale
again
i
beg
pardon
sir
master
jim
stammered
the
man
i
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
jason
what
are
you
doing
here
jimmie
dale
demanded
sharply
well
sir
said
jason
still
fumbling
for
his
words
it
it
was
the
telephone
the
telephone
yes
sir
a
woman
begging
your
pardon
master
jim
a
lady
sir
has
been
telephoning
every
hour
or
so
and
she
yes
jimmie
dale
had
jumped
across
the
room
and
had
caught
the
other
fiercely
by
the
shoulder
yes
yes
what
did
she
say
quick
man
good
lord
master
jim
faltered
jason
i
she
jason
said
jimmie
dale
suddenly
as
cold
as
ice
what
did
she
say
think
man
every
word
she
did
say
anything
master
jim
nothing
at
all
sir
except
to
keep
asking
each
time
if
she
could
speak
to
nothing
else
jason
no
you
are
sure
i
sure
master
jim
not
another
thing
but
that
sir
just
as
told
thank
god
said
jimmie
dale
in
a
low
voice
yes
sir
said
jason
mechanically
how
long
ago
was
it
since
she
telephoned
last
asked
jimmie
dale
quickly
well
sir
i
could
rightly
say
you
see
as
i
said
master
jim
i
must
have
gone
to
sleep
but
they
were
staring
tensely
into
each
other
face
the
telephone
on
the
desk
was
ringing
vibrantly
clamourously
through
the
stillness
of
the
room
jason
white
frightened
bewildered
touched
his
lips
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
that
be
her
again
sir
he
said
hoarsely
wait
said
jimmie
dale
tersely
he
was
trying
to
think
to
think
faster
than
he
had
ever
thought
before
he
could
not
tell
jason
to
say
that
he
had
not
yet
come
in
they
knew
he
was
in
it
would
be
but
showing
his
hand
to
that
some
one
who
would
be
listening
now
on
the
wire
he
dared
not
speak
to
her
or
above
all
allow
her
to
expose
herself
by
a
single
inadvertent
word
he
dared
not
speak
to
her
and
she
was
here
now
calling
him
he
could
not
speak
to
her
and
it
was
life
and
death
almost
that
she
should
know
what
had
happened
life
and
death
almost
for
both
of
them
that
he
should
know
all
and
everything
she
could
tell
him
true
it
would
take
but
a
minute
to
run
to
the
cellar
and
cut
those
wires
while
jason
held
her
on
the
pretence
of
calling
him
jimmie
dale
to
the
only
a
minute
to
cut
those
wires
and
in
so
doing
advertise
to
these
fiends
the
fact
that
he
had
discovered
their
trick
admit
as
though
in
so
many
words
that
their
suspicions
of
him
were
justified
lay
himself
open
to
some
new
move
that
he
could
not
hope
to
foresee
and
paramount
to
all
else
rob
her
and
himself
of
this
master
trump
the
crime
club
had
placed
in
his
hands
by
means
of
which
there
was
a
chance
that
he
could
hoist
them
with
their
own
petard
the
telephone
rang
again
imperatively
persistently
listen
jimmie
dale
was
speaking
rapidly
earnestly
say
that
i
come
in
and
have
gone
to
bed
in
a
vile
humour
that
you
told
me
a
lady
had
been
calling
but
that
i
said
if
she
called
again
i
to
be
disturbed
if
it
was
the
queen
of
sheba
herself
that
i
answer
any
for
anybody
do
you
understand
no
argument
with
her
just
that
now
answer
jason
lifted
the
receiver
from
the
hook
yes
hello
he
said
yes
dale
has
come
in
but
he
has
retired
yes
i
told
him
but
begging
your
pardon
he
was
in
what
i
might
say
was
a
bit
of
a
temper
and
said
he
was
to
be
disturbed
by
any
jimmie
dale
snatched
the
receiver
from
jason
and
put
it
to
his
own
ear
kindly
tell
dale
that
unless
he
comes
to
the
now
a
feminine
voice
her
voice
in
indignation
was
saying
it
will
be
a
very
long
day
before
i
shall
trouble
myself
to
jimmie
dale
clapped
his
hand
firmly
over
the
mouthpiece
of
the
instrument
thank
god
for
that
clever
brain
of
hers
she
understood
repeat
what
you
said
before
jason
he
instructed
hurriedly
then
say
he
removed
his
hand
from
the
mouthpiece
it
quite
useless
said
jason
apologetically
in
the
rare
temper
he
was
in
he
would
come
to
use
his
own
words
not
for
the
queen
of
sheba
herself
jimmie
dale
hung
the
receiver
back
on
the
hook
and
with
his
hand
flirted
away
a
bead
of
moisture
that
had
sprung
to
his
forehead
good
lord
master
jim
what
wrong
sir
what
happened
sir
and
and
those
clothes
master
jim
sir
they
are
the
ones
you
went
out
in
sir
they
are
yours
at
all
sir
jason
ventured
anxiously
jason
said
jimmie
dale
switch
off
the
light
and
go
to
the
front
window
and
look
out
keep
well
behind
the
curtains
do
show
yourself
tell
me
if
you
see
yes
sir
said
jason
obediently
the
light
went
out
jimmie
dale
moved
to
the
rear
of
the
room
to
the
window
overlooking
the
garage
and
yard
i
do
see
anything
sir
jason
called
watch
jimmie
dale
answered
a
minute
passed
two
three
jimmie
dale
was
staring
down
into
the
black
of
the
yard
she
understood
she
knew
of
course
before
she
that
something
had
gone
wrong
she
knew
that
only
peril
of
the
gravest
moment
would
have
kept
him
from
the
and
her
she
knew
now
as
a
logical
conclusion
that
it
was
dangerous
to
attempt
to
communicate
with
him
at
his
home
those
wires
where
did
they
lead
to
not
far
away
that
would
be
almost
a
mechanical
impossibility
was
it
into
the
crime
club
itself
near
at
hand
or
the
basement
say
of
that
apartment
house
across
the
driveway
or
where
and
then
jimmie
dale
spoke
again
do
you
see
anything
jason
i
not
sure
sir
jason
answered
hesitantly
i
thought
i
saw
a
man
move
behind
a
tree
out
there
across
the
road
a
minute
ago
sir
yes
sir
there
he
is
again
there
was
a
thin
mirthless
smile
on
jimmie
dale
lips
below
in
the
shadow
of
the
garage
a
dark
form
like
a
deeper
shadow
stirred
and
was
still
again
what
time
is
it
jason
jimmie
dale
asked
presently
it
be
about
four
go
to
bed
yes
sir
but
jason
voice
low
troubled
came
through
the
darkness
from
the
upper
end
of
the
room
master
jim
sir
i
go
to
bed
jason
and
not
a
word
of
yes
sir
master
jimmie
dale
groped
his
way
to
the
big
lounging
chair
in
which
he
had
found
jason
asleep
and
flung
himself
into
it
they
had
struck
quickly
these
ingenious
murderers
of
the
crime
club
the
house
was
already
watched
would
be
watched
now
untiringly
unceasingly
not
a
movement
of
his
henceforth
but
would
be
under
their
eyes
his
hands
resting
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
closed
slowly
until
they
became
knotted
fists
what
was
he
to
do
it
was
not
only
the
crime
club
it
was
not
only
the
tocsin
and
her
peril
there
was
the
underworld
snapping
and
snarling
at
his
heels
there
was
the
police
dogged
and
sullen
ever
on
the
trail
of
the
gray
seal
his
life
even
before
this
in
his
fight
against
the
underworld
and
the
police
had
depended
upon
his
freedom
of
action
and
now
at
one
and
the
same
time
that
freedom
was
cut
away
from
beneath
his
feet
as
it
were
and
a
third
foe
equally
as
deadly
as
the
others
was
added
to
the
list
for
months
to
preserve
and
sustain
the
character
of
larry
the
bat
he
had
been
forced
to
assume
the
role
almost
daily
for
in
that
sordid
empire
below
the
dead
line
whose
one
common
bond
and
aim
was
the
gray
seal
death
where
suspicion
one
of
the
other
was
rampant
and
extravagant
where
each
might
be
the
one
against
whom
all
swore
their
vengeance
larry
the
bat
could
not
mysteriously
disappear
from
his
accustomed
haunts
without
inviting
suspicion
in
an
active
and
practical
form
an
inquisitorial
visit
to
his
squalid
lodgings
the
sanctuary
and
the
end
of
larry
the
bat
if
as
he
had
thought
only
a
few
hours
before
he
was
through
forever
with
his
dual
life
that
would
not
have
mattered
the
underworld
would
have
been
welcome
to
make
what
it
chose
of
it
but
now
the
preservation
of
the
character
of
larry
the
bat
was
more
vital
and
necessary
to
him
than
it
had
ever
been
before
it
was
a
means
of
defense
and
offense
against
these
men
who
lurked
now
outside
his
doors
it
was
the
sole
means
now
of
communication
with
her
for
warned
both
by
words
and
what
must
be
an
obvious
fact
to
her
that
their
plans
had
miscarried
that
it
was
dangerous
to
communicate
with
him
as
jimmie
dale
she
would
expect
him
count
on
him
to
make
that
move
there
would
be
no
longer
either
reason
or
attempt
on
her
part
to
maintain
the
mystery
with
which
she
had
heretofore
surrounded
herself
the
crisis
had
come
she
would
be
watching
waiting
hoping
seeking
for
him
more
anxiously
and
with
far
more
at
stake
than
he
had
ever
sought
for
her
until
now
he
got
up
impulsively
from
his
chair
and
in
the
blackness
began
to
pace
the
room
the
next
move
was
clear
pitifully
clear
it
had
been
clear
from
the
first
it
had
been
clear
even
in
that
ride
in
the
car
it
was
so
clear
that
it
seemed
veritably
to
mock
him
as
he
prodded
his
brains
for
some
means
of
putting
it
into
execution
he
must
get
to
the
sanctuary
become
larry
the
bat
but
how
how
the
question
seemed
at
last
to
become
resonant
to
ring
through
the
room
with
the
weight
of
doom
upon
it
schemes
plans
ideas
came
bringing
a
momentary
uplift
only
to
be
discarded
the
next
instant
with
a
sort
of
bitter
desperate
regret
these
men
were
not
men
of
mere
ordinary
intelligence
their
cleverness
their
power
the
amazing
scope
of
their
organisation
all
bore
grim
witness
to
the
fact
that
they
would
be
blinded
not
at
all
by
any
paltry
ruse
he
could
walk
out
of
the
house
in
the
morning
as
jimmie
dale
without
apparent
hindrance
that
was
obvious
enough
and
so
long
as
he
pursued
the
usual
avocations
of
jimmie
dale
he
would
not
be
interfered
with
only
watched
it
was
useless
to
consider
that
plan
for
a
moment
it
would
not
help
him
to
reach
the
sanctuary
without
leading
them
there
behind
him
true
there
was
always
the
chance
that
he
might
shake
them
off
his
trail
but
he
could
hardly
hope
to
accomplish
anything
like
that
without
their
knowing
that
it
was
done
deliberately
and
that
he
dared
not
risk
the
strongest
weapon
in
his
hands
now
was
his
secret
knowledge
that
he
was
being
watched
that
telephone
there
for
instance
that
most
curiously
kept
on
insisting
in
his
mind
that
it
and
it
alone
was
the
way
out
was
the
last
thing
he
could
place
in
jeopardy
besides
there
was
another
reason
why
such
a
plan
would
not
do
for
granting
even
that
he
succeeded
in
eluding
them
on
the
way
and
managed
to
reach
the
sanctuary
his
freedom
of
action
would
be
so
restricted
and
limited
as
to
be
practically
worthless
he
would
have
to
return
to
his
home
here
again
within
a
reasonable
time
as
jimmie
dale
within
a
few
hours
at
most
or
again
they
would
be
in
possession
of
the
fact
that
he
had
discovered
their
surveillance
that
it
was
true
had
been
his
original
plan
when
he
had
entered
the
house
half
an
hour
previously
but
it
was
an
entirely
different
matter
now
then
he
had
counted
on
getting
away
without
their
knowing
it
before
they
as
he
had
fondly
thought
would
have
had
a
chance
to
establish
their
espionage
and
when
they
would
have
had
no
reason
to
suspect
for
a
time
at
least
that
he
was
not
still
within
the
house
when
they
would
have
been
watching
as
it
were
an
empty
cage
he
stopped
in
his
walk
and
after
a
moment
dropped
down
into
the
lounging
chair
again
that
was
it
of
course
an
empty
cage
if
he
could
escape
from
the
house
not
so
much
without
their
seeing
him
that
was
more
or
less
a
mechanical
detail
but
escape
and
leave
them
in
possession
of
a
sort
of
guarantee
or
assurance
that
he
was
still
there
that
would
give
him
the
freedom
of
action
that
he
must
have
he
smiled
with
bitter
irony
that
solved
the
problem
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
just
that
it
was
very
simple
exceedingly
simple
it
was
only
impossible
the
smile
left
his
lips
and
once
more
his
hands
clenched
fiercely
no
it
was
not
impossible
it
must
be
done
if
he
was
to
win
through
if
he
was
even
to
save
himself
it
must
be
done
or
fail
her
it
could
be
done
there
was
a
way
if
he
could
only
see
it
chapter
vii
the
hour
as
the
minutes
passed
many
of
them
jimmie
dale
sat
there
motionless
staring
before
him
at
the
desk
that
was
faintly
outlined
in
the
unlighted
room
then
somewhere
in
the
house
a
clock
struck
the
hour
five
he
raised
his
head
yes
it
could
be
done
there
was
a
way
he
had
the
germ
of
it
now
and
now
the
plan
began
to
grow
to
take
form
and
shape
in
his
mind
to
dovetail
to
knit
the
integral
parts
into
a
comprehensive
whole
there
was
a
way
but
he
must
have
assistance
jason
yes
assuredly
benson
his
chauffeur
yes
equally
as
trustworthy
as
jason
benson
was
devoted
to
him
and
moreover
benson
was
young
alert
daring
cool
he
had
had
more
than
one
occasion
to
test
benson
resourcefulness
and
nerve
jimmie
dale
rose
abruptly
went
to
the
rear
window
and
parting
the
curtains
cautiously
stood
peering
down
into
the
courtyard
yes
it
was
feasible
even
a
little
more
than
feasible
the
garage
fronted
the
driveway
of
course
to
give
free
entrance
and
egress
to
the
cars
but
where
the
wall
of
the
garage
and
the
rear
wall
of
the
house
overlapped
as
it
were
the
space
between
them
was
not
much
more
than
ten
yards
and
here
the
shadows
of
the
two
walls
mingling
lay
like
a
black
impenetrable
pathway
not
like
that
other
shadow
he
had
seen
moving
at
the
side
of
the
garage
and
that
if
not
for
the
moment
discernible
was
none
the
less
surely
still
lurking
there
satisfied
jimmie
dale
swung
briskly
from
the
window
and
going
now
to
his
bedroom
across
the
hall
undressed
and
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
there
would
be
time
enough
to
sleep
all
day
if
he
wished
now
there
were
still
the
little
details
to
be
thought
out
that
more
than
anything
else
could
make
or
wreck
his
plans
a
point
overdone
the
faintest
suggestion
of
a
false
note
where
men
of
the
calibre
of
those
against
whom
he
was
now
fighting
for
his
life
were
concerned
would
not
only
make
his
scheme
abortive
but
would
place
him
utterly
at
their
mercy
it
was
nine
when
he
rang
for
jason
jason
he
said
abruptly
as
the
other
entered
i
want
you
to
telephone
for
doctor
the
doctor
sir
exclaimed
the
old
man
anxiously
you
you
not
ill
master
jim
sir
do
i
look
ill
jason
inquired
jimmie
dale
gravely
well
sir
admitted
jason
in
concern
a
bit
done
up
sir
perhaps
a
little
pale
sir
though
i
sure
i
glad
to
hear
it
said
jimmie
dale
sitting
up
in
bed
the
worse
i
look
the
better
i
i
beg
pardon
sir
stammered
jason
jason
said
jimmie
dale
gravely
again
you
have
had
reason
to
know
that
on
several
occasions
my
life
has
been
threatened
it
is
threatened
now
you
know
from
last
night
that
this
house
is
now
watched
you
may
or
you
may
not
have
surmised
that
our
telephone
wires
have
been
tapped
sir
jason
face
had
gone
a
little
gray
yes
a
party
line
so
to
speak
said
jimmie
dale
grimly
do
you
understand
you
must
be
careful
to
say
no
more
no
less
than
exactly
what
i
tell
you
to
say
now
go
and
telephone
ask
the
doctor
to
come
over
and
see
me
this
morning
simply
say
that
i
am
not
feeling
well
but
that
apart
from
being
apparently
in
a
very
nervous
condition
you
do
not
know
what
is
the
yes
sir
good
lord
sir
gasped
jason
and
left
the
room
to
carry
out
his
orders
an
hour
later
doctor
merlin
had
been
and
gone
and
had
left
two
prescriptions
one
written
the
other
verbal
with
the
written
one
benson
in
his
chauffeur
livery
was
dispatched
to
the
drug
store
the
verbal
one
was
precisely
what
jimmie
dale
had
expected
from
the
fussy
old
family
physician
two
or
three
days
of
quiet
in
the
house
james
and
if
you
need
me
again
let
me
now
jason
said
jimmie
dale
when
the
old
man
had
returned
from
ushering
doctor
merlin
from
the
house
our
friends
out
there
will
be
anxious
to
learn
the
verdict
i
was
to
dine
with
the
night
was
i
not
yes
sir
i
think
so
make
sure
said
jimmie
dale
look
in
my
engagement
book
there
on
the
jason
looked
yes
sir
that
right
he
announced
very
good
said
jimmie
dale
softly
now
go
and
telephone
again
jason
present
my
regrets
and
excuses
to
the
and
say
that
under
the
doctor
orders
i
am
confined
to
the
house
for
the
next
few
days
and
jason
yes
sir
when
benson
returns
with
the
medicine
let
him
bring
it
here
himself
and
i
shall
want
you
as
jimmie
dale
propped
himself
up
a
little
wearily
on
the
pillows
as
jason
went
out
of
the
room
after
all
his
condition
was
not
entirely
feigned
he
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
pretty
well
played
out
both
mentally
and
physically
certainly
that
he
should
require
a
doctor
and
be
confined
to
the
house
could
not
arouse
suspicion
even
in
the
minds
of
those
alert
aristocratic
thugs
of
the
crime
club
prone
as
they
would
be
to
suspect
anything
a
man
who
had
been
knocked
unconscious
in
an
automobile
smash
the
night
before
had
been
in
a
fight
had
been
subjected
to
a
terrific
mental
shock
to
say
nothing
of
the
infernal
drug
that
had
been
administered
to
him
might
well
be
expected
to
be
indisposed
the
next
morning
and
for
several
mornings
following
that
it
might
indeed
even
cause
them
to
relax
their
vigilance
for
the
time
being
though
he
dared
build
nothing
on
that
well
he
had
only
to
coach
benson
and
jason
in
the
parts
they
were
to
play
and
the
balance
of
the
morning
and
all
the
afternoon
was
his
in
which
to
rest
he
reached
over
to
the
table
picked
up
a
pencil
and
paper
and
began
to
jot
down
memoranda
he
had
just
tossed
the
pencil
back
on
the
table
as
the
two
men
entered
jason
at
a
sign
closed
the
door
quietly
jimmie
dale
looked
at
benson
half
musingly
half
whimsically
for
a
moment
before
he
spoke
benson
he
said
the
back
seat
of
the
large
touring
car
is
hinged
and
lifts
up
once
the
cushion
is
removed
does
it
yes
sir
benson
answered
promptly
and
there
space
enough
for
say
a
man
inside
is
there
why
yes
sir
i
suppose
so
at
a
squeeze
benson
stared
blankly
quite
so
said
jimmie
dale
calmly
now
another
matter
benson
i
believe
some
chauffeurs
have
a
habit
when
occasion
lends
itself
of
taking
shall
we
say
their
girl
out
riding
in
their
machines
some
might
benson
replied
a
little
stiffly
i
hope
you
do
think
sir
that
one
moment
benson
the
point
is
it
done
quite
generally
yes
and
you
have
a
girl
or
at
least
could
find
one
for
such
a
purpose
if
you
were
so
inclined
yes
sir
said
benson
but
very
good
jimmie
dale
interrupted
then
benson
taking
advantage
of
my
illness
and
night
and
the
nights
after
that
until
further
notice
you
will
acquire
and
put
into
practice
that
reprehensible
i
i
do
understand
no
i
dare
say
not
said
jimmie
dale
and
then
the
whimsicality
dropped
from
him
benson
he
said
slowly
do
you
remember
a
night
nearly
four
years
ago
the
first
night
you
ever
saw
me
you
had
indiscreetly
i
think
displayed
more
money
than
was
wise
in
that
east
side
i
remember
said
benson
with
a
sudden
start
then
simply
i
be
here
now
sir
if
it
had
been
for
well
said
jimmie
dale
quietly
the
tables
are
turned
benson
as
jason
already
knows
this
house
is
watched
for
reasons
that
i
can
not
explain
i
am
in
great
danger
bluntly
i
am
putting
my
life
in
your
hands
and
benson
looked
for
an
instant
from
jimmie
dale
to
jason
caught
the
strained
troubled
expression
on
the
old
man
face
then
back
again
at
jimmie
dale
d
mean
that
sir
he
cried
then
you
can
count
on
me
dale
to
the
last
ditch
i
know
that
benson
jimmie
dale
said
softly
and
now
both
of
you
listen
it
is
imperative
that
i
should
get
away
from
the
house
and
equally
imperative
that
those
watching
should
believe
that
i
am
still
here
not
even
the
servants
are
to
be
permitted
a
suspicion
that
i
am
not
here
in
my
bed
that
jason
is
your
task
you
will
allow
no
one
to
wait
on
me
but
yourself
you
will
bring
the
meal
trays
up
regularly
and
eat
the
food
yourself
you
will
answer
all
inquiries
telephone
and
otherwise
in
person
i
am
not
seeing
any
one
you
understand
perfectly
jason
i
understand
master
jim
you
need
have
no
fear
sir
on
that
now
you
benson
jimmie
dale
went
on
a
few
minutes
ago
i
sent
you
out
in
your
chauffeur
togs
with
that
prescription
you
were
undoubtedly
observed
i
wanted
you
to
be
it
was
quite
necessary
that
they
should
know
and
be
able
to
recognise
you
again
to
disabuse
their
minds
later
on
of
the
possibility
that
i
might
be
masquerading
in
your
clothes
and
also
of
course
that
they
should
know
who
you
were
and
what
your
position
was
in
the
household
very
well
at
eight
exactly
you
are
to
go
out
from
the
back
door
of
the
house
to
the
garage
on
the
way
out
it
will
be
quite
dark
then
i
want
you
to
drop
something
say
a
bunch
of
keys
that
you
had
been
jingling
in
your
hand
you
are
to
experience
some
difficulty
in
finding
it
again
move
about
a
little
to
force
any
one
that
may
be
lurking
by
the
garage
to
retreat
around
the
corner
grumble
a
bit
and
make
a
little
noise
but
you
are
not
to
overdo
it
a
couple
of
minutes
at
the
outside
is
enough
by
that
time
i
shall
be
under
the
car
seat
you
will
then
run
the
machine
out
to
the
street
and
stop
at
the
curb
jump
out
and
as
though
you
had
forgotten
something
hurry
back
to
the
garage
you
must
not
be
away
long
enough
only
to
permit
say
a
to
glance
into
the
car
and
satisfy
himself
that
it
is
empty
you
understand
of
course
benson
that
the
hood
must
be
down
no
closed
car
to
invite
even
the
suggestion
of
concealment
that
would
be
a
fatal
blunder
drive
then
to
the
young
lady
home
by
as
direct
a
route
as
you
can
give
no
appearance
of
being
aware
that
you
are
followed
as
you
will
be
and
much
less
the
appearance
of
attempting
to
elude
pursuit
act
naturally
between
here
and
your
destination
i
will
manage
readily
enough
to
leave
the
car
you
will
then
take
the
young
lady
for
her
drive
that
is
what
they
will
be
interested
in
your
motive
for
going
out
and
as
i
said
take
her
driving
again
on
each
succeeding
night
establish
the
habit
to
their
jimmie
dale
paused
glanced
at
the
paper
which
he
still
held
in
his
hand
then
handed
it
to
benson
just
one
thing
more
benson
he
said
listed
on
that
paper
you
will
find
a
different
rendezvous
for
each
night
for
the
next
five
nights
excluding
which
after
you
have
returned
the
young
lady
to
her
home
you
are
to
pass
by
on
your
way
back
here
see
that
your
drive
is
always
over
in
time
for
you
to
pass
each
night
rendezvous
at
half
past
eleven
sharp
do
stop
unless
i
signal
you
if
i
am
not
there
go
right
on
home
and
be
at
the
next
place
on
the
following
night
i
am
fairly
well
satisfied
they
will
not
bother
about
you
after
or
night
at
the
most
but
for
all
that
you
must
take
no
chances
so
except
in
the
route
you
take
in
going
to
the
young
lady
always
avoid
covering
the
same
ground
twice
which
might
give
the
appearance
of
having
some
ulterior
purpose
in
view
even
in
your
drives
vary
your
runs
is
this
clear
benson
yes
sir
said
benson
earnestly
very
well
then
said
jimmie
dale
eight
to
the
dot
benson
compare
your
time
with
jason
and
now
jason
see
that
i
get
a
chance
to
sleep
until
dinner
time
the
hours
that
followed
were
hours
of
sound
and
sleep
for
jimmie
dale
and
from
which
he
awoke
only
on
jason
entrance
that
evening
with
the
dinner
tray
i
slept
like
a
log
jason
he
cried
briskly
as
he
leaped
out
of
bed
anything
new
anything
happened
no
sir
not
a
thing
jason
answered
only
master
jim
sir
the
old
man
twisted
his
hands
nervously
i
you
excuse
my
saying
so
sir
i
do
hope
you
be
careful
sir
i
ca
help
being
afraid
that
something
happen
to
you
master
nonsense
jason
jimmie
dale
laughed
cheerfully
there
nothing
going
to
happen
to
me
you
go
ahead
now
and
stay
with
the
servants
and
get
them
out
of
the
road
at
the
proper
he
bathed
dressed
ate
his
dinner
and
was
slipping
cartridges
into
the
magazine
of
his
automatic
when
within
a
minute
or
two
of
eight
jason
whisper
came
from
the
doorway
it
all
clear
now
master
jim
right
jimmie
dale
responded
and
followed
jason
down
the
stairway
and
to
the
head
of
the
cellar
stairs
here
jason
halted
god
keep
you
master
jim
said
the
old
man
huskily
jason
jimmie
dale
answered
softly
and
with
a
reassuring
squeeze
on
the
other
arm
went
on
down
to
the
cellar
here
he
moved
quickly
noiselessly
across
to
the
window
not
the
window
of
the
night
before
but
another
of
the
same
description
almost
directly
beneath
the
one
in
his
den
above
that
faced
the
garage
and
lay
in
the
line
of
that
black
shadow
path
between
the
two
buildings
deftly
cautiously
without
sound
a
half
inch
an
inch
at
a
time
he
opened
it
he
stood
listening
then
a
minute
passed
then
he
heard
benson
open
and
shut
the
back
door
then
benson
in
the
yard
and
then
benson
voice
in
a
muttered
and
irritable
growl
talking
to
himself
as
he
stamped
around
on
the
ground
with
a
lithe
agile
movement
jimmie
dale
pulled
himself
up
and
through
the
window
and
began
to
creep
rapidly
on
hands
and
knees
toward
the
garage
it
was
dark
intensely
dark
he
could
barely
distinguish
benson
form
though
as
he
passed
the
other
the
slight
sounds
he
made
drowned
out
by
the
chauffeur
angry
mumblings
he
could
have
reached
out
and
touched
benson
easily
he
gained
the
interior
of
the
garage
and
as
benson
came
on
again
stepped
lightly
into
the
car
lifted
the
seat
and
wriggled
his
way
inside
it
was
close
stuffy
abominably
cramped
but
jimmie
dale
was
smiling
grimly
now
thanks
to
benson
there
was
a
possibility
that
he
had
been
seen
he
both
felt
and
heard
benson
start
the
car
then
the
car
moved
forward
ran
the
length
of
the
driveway
bumped
slightly
as
it
made
the
street
and
stopped
he
heard
benson
jump
out
and
run
back
and
then
he
listened
intently
and
the
grim
smile
flickered
on
his
lips
again
came
the
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
sidewalk
close
beside
the
car
then
silence
the
car
shook
a
little
as
though
some
one
weight
was
on
the
step
then
the
footsteps
receded
benson
returned
on
the
run
and
the
car
started
forward
once
more
perhaps
ten
minutes
passed
three
times
the
car
had
swerved
sharply
making
a
corner
turn
then
jimmie
dale
pushed
up
the
seat
and
protected
from
observation
from
behind
by
the
back
of
the
car
itself
crawled
out
and
crouched
down
on
the
floor
of
the
tonneau
do
look
around
benson
he
said
calmly
are
we
followed
yes
benson
answered
at
least
there
always
been
a
car
behind
us
though
not
the
same
one
they
pretty
clever
there
must
be
three
or
four
each
following
the
other
every
time
i
turn
a
corner
it
a
different
car
that
turns
it
behind
how
far
behind
jimmie
dale
asked
half
a
slow
down
a
little
instructed
jimmie
dale
and
do
turn
another
corner
until
they
had
a
chance
to
accommodate
themselves
to
your
new
speed
you
are
going
too
fast
for
me
to
jump
and
i
do
want
them
to
notice
any
change
in
speed
except
what
is
made
in
plain
sight
yes
that
better
where
are
we
benson
that
amsterdam
avenue
ahead
replied
benson
all
right
said
jimmie
dale
quietly
turn
into
it
the
more
people
the
better
tell
me
just
as
you
are
about
to
yes
sir
said
benson
then
almost
on
the
instant
all
ready
sir
jimmie
dale
hand
reached
out
for
the
door
catch
edged
the
door
ajar
the
car
swerved
took
the
corner
and
jimmie
dale
stepped
out
on
the
running
board
hung
there
negligently
for
a
moment
as
though
chatting
with
benson
and
then
with
an
airy
dropped
nonchalantly
to
the
ground
and
the
next
instant
had
mingled
with
the
throng
of
pedestrians
on
the
sidewalk
a
half
minute
later
a
large
gray
automobile
turned
the
corner
and
followed
benson
and
jimmie
dale
stepping
out
into
the
street
again
swung
on
a
downtown
car
the
road
to
the
sanctuary
was
open
in
his
impatience
now
the
street
car
seemed
to
drag
along
every
foot
of
the
way
but
a
glance
at
his
watch
as
he
finally
reached
the
bowery
and
walking
then
rapidly
approached
the
cross
street
a
few
steps
ahead
that
led
to
the
sanctuary
told
him
that
it
was
still
but
a
quarter
to
nine
but
even
at
that
he
quickened
his
steps
a
little
he
was
free
now
there
was
a
sort
of
savage
elemental
uplift
upon
him
he
was
free
he
could
strike
now
in
his
own
defense
and
hers
in
a
few
moments
he
would
be
at
the
sanctuary
in
a
few
more
he
would
be
larry
the
bat
and
by
at
the
latest
he
would
see
the
tocsin
after
all
that
hour
was
not
to
be
taken
from
him
it
was
not
perhaps
the
hour
that
she
had
meant
it
should
be
thought
and
prayed
perhaps
that
it
might
be
it
was
not
the
hour
of
victory
but
it
was
the
hour
that
meant
to
him
the
realisation
of
the
years
of
longing
the
hour
when
he
should
see
her
see
her
for
the
first
time
face
to
face
when
there
should
be
no
more
barriers
between
them
when
fer
gawd
sake
mister
buy
a
pencil
a
hand
was
plucking
at
his
sleeve
the
thin
voice
was
whining
in
his
ear
he
halted
mechanically
a
woman
old
bedraggled
ragged
was
thrusting
a
bunch
of
cheap
pencils
imploringly
toward
him
and
then
with
a
stifled
cry
jimmie
dale
leaned
forward
the
eyes
that
lifted
to
his
for
an
instant
were
bright
and
clear
with
the
vigor
of
youth
great
eyes
of
brown
they
were
and
trouble
hope
fear
wistfulness
ay
and
a
glorious
shyness
were
in
their
depths
and
then
the
voice
he
knew
so
well
the
tocsin
was
whispering
hurriedly
i
will
be
waiting
here
jimmie
for
larry
the
chapter
viii
the
tocsin
it
was
only
a
little
way
back
along
the
street
from
the
sanctuary
to
the
corner
on
the
bowery
where
as
jimmie
dale
he
had
left
her
where
as
larry
the
bat
now
he
was
going
to
meet
her
again
it
would
take
only
a
moment
or
so
even
at
larry
the
bat
habitual
characteristic
slouching
gait
but
it
seemed
that
was
all
too
slow
that
he
must
throw
discretion
to
the
winds
and
run
the
distance
his
blood
was
tingling
there
was
elation
upon
him
coupled
with
an
almost
childlike
dread
that
she
might
be
gone
the
tocsin
the
tocsin
he
kept
saying
to
himself
yes
she
was
still
there
still
whiningly
imploring
those
who
passed
to
buy
her
miserable
pencils
and
then
with
a
whisper
to
him
to
follow
as
he
slouched
up
close
to
her
she
had
started
slowly
down
the
street
the
tocsin
the
tocsin
the
tocsin
his
brain
seemed
to
be
ringing
with
the
words
ringing
with
them
in
a
note
clear
as
a
silver
bell
the
tocsin
at
last
the
woman
who
so
strangely
so
wonderfully
so
mysteriously
had
entered
into
his
life
and
possessed
it
and
filled
it
with
a
love
and
yearning
that
had
come
to
mold
and
sway
and
actuate
his
very
existence
the
woman
for
whom
he
had
fought
for
whom
he
had
risked
and
gladly
risked
his
wealth
his
name
his
honour
everything
the
woman
for
whose
sake
he
the
gray
seal
was
sought
and
hounded
as
the
most
notorious
criminal
of
the
age
she
whose
cleverness
whose
resourcefulness
whose
amazing
intimacy
with
the
hidden
things
of
the
underworld
had
seemed
indeed
to
border
on
the
supernatural
she
the
tocsin
the
woman
whose
face
he
had
never
seen
before
the
woman
whose
face
he
had
never
seen
before
and
who
now
was
that
wretched
hag
that
hobbled
along
the
street
before
him
begging
whining
and
importuning
the
to
purchase
of
her
pitiful
wares
he
laughed
a
little
buoyantly
he
had
never
pictured
a
first
meeting
such
as
this
a
hag
yes
and
one
as
disreputable
in
appearance
as
he
himself
as
larry
the
bat
was
disreputable
but
he
had
seen
her
eyes
inimitable
as
was
her
disguise
she
could
not
hide
her
eyes
or
hide
the
pledge
they
held
of
the
beauty
of
form
and
feature
beneath
the
tattered
rags
and
the
touch
of
a
master
in
the
that
brought
haggard
want
and
age
into
the
face
and
dimly
he
began
to
divine
the
source
the
means
by
which
she
had
acquired
the
information
that
for
years
had
enabled
her
to
plan
their
coups
that
had
enabled
him
to
execute
them
under
the
guise
of
crime
that
for
years
had
seemed
beyond
all
human
reach
where
was
she
going
where
was
she
taking
him
but
what
did
it
matter
the
years
of
waiting
were
at
an
end
the
years
of
mystery
in
a
few
moments
now
would
be
mystery
no
more
ah
she
had
turned
from
the
bowery
and
was
heading
east
he
shuffled
on
after
her
guardedly
a
half
block
behind
it
was
well
that
jimmie
dale
had
disappeared
that
he
was
larry
the
bat
again
the
neighbourhood
was
growing
more
and
more
one
that
jimmie
dale
could
not
long
linger
in
without
attracting
attention
while
on
the
other
hand
it
was
the
natural
environment
of
such
as
larry
the
bat
and
such
as
she
who
was
leading
him
now
to
the
supreme
moment
of
his
life
yes
it
was
that
the
fulfillment
of
the
years
the
thought
of
it
alone
filled
his
mind
his
soul
it
brushed
aside
it
blotted
out
for
the
time
being
the
danger
the
peril
the
deadly
menace
that
hung
over
them
both
it
was
only
that
she
the
tocsin
was
here
only
that
at
last
they
would
be
together
on
she
went
traversing
street
after
street
the
direction
always
trending
toward
the
river
until
finally
she
halted
before
what
appeared
to
be
as
nearly
as
he
could
make
out
in
the
almost
total
darkness
of
the
street
a
small
and
dwelling
that
bordered
on
what
seemed
to
be
an
unfenced
store
yard
of
some
description
he
drew
his
breath
in
sharply
she
had
halted
waiting
for
him
to
come
up
with
her
she
was
waiting
for
him
waiting
for
him
it
seemed
as
though
he
drank
of
some
strange
exhilarating
elixir
he
reached
her
side
eagerly
and
then
and
then
her
hand
had
caught
his
and
she
was
leading
him
into
the
house
into
a
black
passage
where
he
could
see
nothing
into
a
room
equally
black
over
whose
threshold
he
stumbled
and
her
voice
in
a
low
conscious
way
with
a
little
tremour
a
half
sob
in
it
that
thrilled
him
with
its
promise
was
in
his
ears
we
are
safe
here
jimmie
for
a
little
while
but
oh
jimmie
what
have
i
done
what
have
i
done
to
bring
you
into
this
only
only
i
was
so
sure
so
sure
jimmie
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
fear
the
blood
was
beating
in
hammer
blows
at
his
temples
it
seemed
all
unreal
untrue
that
this
moment
could
be
his
that
it
was
not
a
dream
a
dream
which
was
presently
to
be
snatched
from
him
in
a
bitter
awakening
and
then
he
laughed
out
wildly
passionately
no
it
was
true
it
was
real
her
breath
was
on
his
cheek
it
was
a
living
pulsing
hand
that
was
still
in
his
and
then
soul
and
mind
and
body
seemed
engulfed
and
lost
in
a
mad
ecstasy
and
she
was
in
his
arms
crushed
to
him
and
he
was
raining
kisses
upon
her
face
i
love
you
i
love
you
he
was
crying
hoarsely
and
over
and
over
again
i
love
you
i
love
you
she
did
not
struggle
the
warm
rich
lips
were
yielding
to
his
he
could
feel
the
throb
the
life
in
the
young
lithe
form
against
his
own
she
was
his
his
the
years
the
past
all
were
swept
away
and
she
was
his
at
last
his
for
always
and
there
came
a
mighty
sense
of
kingship
upon
him
as
though
all
the
world
were
at
his
feet
and
virility
and
a
great
glad
strength
above
all
other
men
and
a
song
was
in
his
soul
a
song
triumphant
for
she
was
his
you
he
cried
out
and
strained
her
to
him
you
he
cried
again
and
kissed
her
lips
and
her
eyelids
and
her
lips
again
and
then
her
head
was
buried
on
his
shoulder
and
she
was
crying
softly
but
after
a
moment
she
raised
her
hands
and
laid
them
upon
his
face
and
held
them
there
and
because
it
was
dark
dared
to
raise
her
head
as
well
and
her
eyes
to
look
into
his
then
for
a
long
time
they
stood
there
so
and
for
a
long
time
neither
spoke
and
then
with
a
little
startled
broken
cry
as
though
the
peril
and
the
menace
hanging
over
them
forgotten
for
the
moment
were
thrust
like
a
knife
stab
suddenly
upon
her
she
drew
herself
away
and
ran
from
him
and
went
and
got
a
lamp
and
lighted
it
and
set
it
upon
the
table
and
jimmie
dale
still
standing
there
watched
her
how
gloriously
her
eyes
shone
dimmed
and
misty
with
the
tears
that
filled
them
though
they
were
and
there
was
nothing
incongruous
in
the
rags
that
clothed
her
in
the
squalour
and
poverty
of
the
bare
room
in
the
white
furrows
that
the
tears
had
plowed
through
the
grime
and
on
her
cheeks
you
wonderful
wonderful
woman
jimmie
dale
whispered
she
shook
her
head
as
though
almost
in
i
am
not
wonderful
jimmie
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
and
then
she
caught
his
arm
and
her
voice
broke
a
little
i
brought
you
into
this
probably
to
your
death
jimmie
tell
me
what
happened
last
night
and
since
then
i
i
thought
at
times
i
should
go
mad
oh
jimmie
there
is
so
much
to
say
so
much
to
do
if
if
we
are
ever
to
be
together
for
for
always
last
night
jimmie
the
telephone
i
knew
there
was
danger
that
all
had
gone
wrong
what
was
it
his
arms
were
around
her
shoulders
drawing
her
close
to
him
again
i
found
the
wires
tapped
he
said
slowly
yes
and
and
the
man
you
met
the
chauffeur
he
is
dead
jimmie
dale
answered
gently
he
felt
her
hand
close
with
a
quick
spasmodic
clutch
upon
his
arm
her
face
grew
white
and
for
a
moment
she
turned
away
her
head
and
and
the
package
she
asked
presently
i
do
not
know
replied
jimmie
dale
he
did
not
have
it
with
him
he
wait
she
interrupted
quickly
we
are
only
wasting
time
like
this
tell
me
everything
everything
just
as
it
happened
everything
from
the
moment
you
received
my
and
holding
her
there
in
his
arms
softening
as
best
he
could
the
more
brutal
details
he
told
her
and
at
the
end
for
a
little
while
she
was
silent
then
in
a
strained
impulsive
way
she
asked
again
the
chauffeur
you
are
sure
you
are
positive
that
he
is
dead
yes
said
jimmie
dale
grimly
i
am
and
then
the
flood
of
questions
burst
from
his
lips
who
was
the
chauffeur
the
package
the
box
numbered
and
john
johansson
and
the
crime
club
and
the
issue
at
stake
the
danger
the
peril
that
surrounded
her
and
she
above
all
more
than
anything
else
about
herself
her
strange
life
its
mystery
she
checked
him
with
a
strangely
wistful
touch
of
her
finger
upon
his
lips
with
a
queer
pathetic
shake
of
her
head
no
jimmie
not
that
way
you
would
never
understand
i
can
not
but
i
am
to
know
now
surely
i
am
to
know
now
he
cried
a
sudden
sense
of
dismay
upon
him
three
years
three
years
and
always
the
next
time
i
must
know
now
if
i
am
to
help
you
she
smiled
a
little
wanly
at
him
as
she
drew
herself
away
and
dropping
into
a
chair
placed
her
elbows
on
the
rickety
table
cupping
her
chin
in
her
hands
yes
you
are
to
know
now
she
said
almost
as
though
she
were
talking
to
herself
then
with
a
swift
intake
of
her
breath
impulsively
jimmie
jimmie
i
had
thought
that
it
would
be
all
so
different
when
when
you
came
that
that
i
would
have
nothing
to
fear
for
you
for
me
because
it
would
be
all
over
and
now
you
are
here
jimmie
and
oh
thank
god
for
you
but
i
feel
almost
almost
as
though
it
were
hopeless
that
that
we
were
beaten
he
stepped
quickly
to
the
table
and
sat
down
and
took
one
of
her
hands
away
from
her
face
to
hold
it
in
both
his
own
beaten
he
laughed
out
defiantly
then
playfully
soothingly
to
reassure
her
jimmie
dale
and
larry
the
bat
and
the
gray
seal
and
the
tocsin
beaten
and
after
we
have
just
scored
the
last
trick
but
we
do
not
hold
many
trumps
jimmie
she
answered
gravely
you
have
seen
something
of
this
crime
club
power
its
methods
its
merciless
cruel
inhuman
cunning
and
you
perhaps
think
that
you
understand
but
you
have
not
begun
to
grasp
the
extent
of
either
that
power
or
cunning
this
horrible
organisation
has
been
in
existence
for
many
years
i
do
not
know
how
many
i
only
know
that
the
men
of
whom
it
is
composed
are
not
ordinary
criminals
that
they
do
not
work
in
the
ordinary
way
they
set
the
machinery
of
fraud
deception
robbery
and
murder
in
motion
that
ten
years
from
now
and
perhaps
only
then
will
culminate
in
the
final
success
of
their
schemes
and
they
play
only
for
enormous
stakes
but
her
lips
grew
set
you
will
see
for
yourself
i
must
not
talk
any
longer
than
is
necessary
we
must
not
take
too
much
time
you
count
on
three
days
before
they
begin
to
suspect
that
all
is
not
right
with
jimmie
dale
i
know
them
better
than
you
and
i
give
you
two
days
hours
at
the
outside
and
possibly
far
less
jimmie
abruptly
did
you
ever
hear
of
peter
lasalle
the
capitalist
yes
said
jimmie
dale
he
died
a
few
years
ago
i
know
his
brother
henry
well
at
the
club
and
all
do
you
she
said
evenly
well
the
man
you
know
is
not
peter
lasalle
brother
he
is
an
impostor
and
one
of
the
crime
not
peter
lasalle
brother
jimmie
dale
repeated
the
words
mechanically
and
suddenly
his
brain
was
whirling
vaguely
dimly
in
little
memory
snatches
events
not
pertinent
then
vitally
significant
now
came
crowding
upon
him
peter
lasalle
had
come
from
somewhere
in
the
west
to
live
in
new
york
and
very
shortly
afterward
had
died
the
estate
had
been
worth
something
over
eleven
millions
and
there
had
been
he
leaned
quickly
tensely
forward
over
the
table
staring
at
her
my
god
he
whispered
hoarsely
you
are
not
you
can
not
be
the
the
daughter
peter
lasalle
daughter
who
disappeared
strangely
yes
she
said
quietly
i
am
marie
chapter
ix
the
tocsin
story
lasalle
the
old
french
name
that
old
french
inscription
on
the
ring
sonnez
le
tocsin
yes
he
began
to
understand
now
she
was
marie
lasalle
he
began
to
remember
more
clearly
marie
lasalle
they
had
said
she
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
girls
who
had
ever
made
her
entree
into
new
york
society
but
he
had
never
met
her
as
marie
lasalle
never
met
her
until
now
as
the
tocsin
in
this
bare
destitute
squalid
hovel
here
at
bay
both
of
them
for
their
lives
he
had
been
away
when
she
had
come
with
her
father
to
new
york
and
on
his
return
there
had
only
been
the
father
brother
in
the
place
and
she
was
gone
he
remembered
the
furor
her
disappearance
had
caused
the
enormous
rewards
her
uncle
had
offered
in
an
effort
to
trace
her
the
thousand
and
one
speculations
as
to
what
had
become
of
her
and
that
then
gradually
as
even
the
most
startling
and
mystifying
of
events
and
happenings
always
do
the
affair
had
dropped
into
oblivion
and
had
been
forgotten
by
the
public
at
least
he
began
to
count
back
yes
it
must
have
been
nearly
five
years
ago
two
years
before
she
as
the
tocsin
and
he
as
the
gray
seal
had
formed
their
amazing
and
singular
partnership
that
he
started
suddenly
as
she
spoke
i
want
to
tell
you
in
as
few
words
as
i
can
she
said
abruptly
breaking
the
silence
listen
then
jimmie
my
mother
died
ten
years
ago
i
was
little
more
than
a
child
then
shortly
after
her
death
father
made
a
business
trip
to
new
york
and
on
the
advice
of
some
supposed
friends
he
had
a
new
will
drawn
up
by
a
lawyer
whom
they
recommended
and
to
whom
they
introduced
him
i
do
not
know
who
those
men
were
the
lawyer
name
was
travers
hilton
she
glanced
curiously
at
jimmie
dale
and
added
quickly
he
was
the
chauffeur
the
man
who
was
killed
last
you
mean
jimmie
dale
burst
out
you
mean
that
he
was
but
first
the
will
what
was
in
the
will
it
was
a
very
simple
will
she
answered
and
from
the
nature
of
it
it
was
not
at
all
strange
that
my
father
should
have
been
willing
to
have
had
it
drawn
by
a
comparative
stranger
if
that
is
what
you
are
thinking
summarised
in
a
few
words
the
will
left
everything
to
me
and
appointed
my
uncle
henry
as
my
guardian
and
the
sole
executor
of
the
estate
until
i
should
have
reached
my
birthday
it
provided
for
a
certain
sum
each
year
to
be
paid
to
my
uncle
for
his
services
as
executor
and
at
the
expiration
of
the
trust
period
that
is
when
i
was
bequeathed
to
him
the
sum
of
one
hundred
thousand
jimmie
dale
nodded
go
on
he
prompted
it
is
hard
to
tell
it
in
logical
sequence
she
said
hesitating
a
moment
so
many
things
seem
to
overlap
each
other
you
must
understand
a
little
more
about
hilton
travers
during
the
five
years
following
the
signing
of
the
will
father
came
frequently
to
new
york
and
became
not
only
intimate
with
travers
but
so
much
impressed
with
the
cleverness
and
ability
that
he
kept
putting
more
and
more
of
his
business
into
travers
hands
at
the
end
of
that
five
years
we
moved
to
new
york
and
father
who
was
then
quite
an
old
man
retired
from
all
active
business
and
turned
over
a
great
many
of
his
personal
affairs
to
travers
to
look
after
for
him
giving
travers
power
of
attorney
in
a
number
of
instances
so
much
for
travers
now
about
my
uncle
he
was
my
father
only
brother
in
fact
they
were
the
only
surviving
members
of
their
family
apart
from
very
distant
connections
in
france
from
where
generations
back
the
family
originally
her
hand
touched
jimmie
dale
for
an
instant
that
ring
jimmie
with
its
crest
and
inscription
is
the
old
family
coat
of
yes
he
said
briefly
i
surmised
as
strange
as
it
may
seem
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
had
not
seen
each
other
for
twenty
years
she
went
on
hurriedly
my
father
and
my
uncle
were
more
than
ordinarily
attached
to
each
other
letters
passed
regularly
between
them
and
there
was
constant
talk
of
one
paying
the
other
a
visit
but
the
visit
never
materialised
my
uncle
was
somewhere
in
australia
my
father
was
here
and
consequently
i
never
saw
my
uncle
he
was
quite
a
different
type
of
man
from
father
more
restless
less
settled
more
rough
and
ready
preferring
the
outdoor
life
of
the
australian
bush
to
the
restrictions
of
any
civilisation
i
imagine
financially
i
do
not
think
he
ever
succeeded
very
well
for
twice
in
one
way
or
another
he
lost
every
sheep
on
his
ranch
and
father
set
him
up
again
and
i
do
not
think
he
could
ever
have
had
much
of
a
ranch
for
i
remember
once
in
one
of
the
letters
he
wrote
that
he
said
he
had
not
seen
a
white
man
in
weeks
so
he
must
have
lived
a
very
lonely
life
indeed
at
about
the
time
father
drew
the
new
will
my
uncle
wrote
saying
that
he
had
decided
to
give
up
sheep
running
on
his
own
account
as
it
did
not
pay
and
to
accept
a
very
favourable
offer
that
had
been
made
to
him
to
manage
a
ranch
in
new
zealand
and
his
next
letter
was
from
the
latter
country
stating
that
he
had
carried
out
his
intentions
and
was
well
satisfied
with
the
change
he
had
made
the
visit
still
continued
to
occupy
my
father
thoughts
and
on
his
retirement
from
business
he
definitely
made
up
his
mind
to
go
out
to
new
zealand
taking
me
with
him
in
fact
the
plans
were
all
arranged
my
uncle
expressed
unbounded
delight
in
his
letters
and
we
were
practically
on
the
eve
of
sailing
when
a
cable
came
from
my
uncle
telling
us
to
postpone
the
visit
for
a
few
months
as
he
was
obliged
to
make
a
buying
trip
for
his
new
employer
that
would
keep
him
away
that
length
of
time
and
then
her
fingers
that
had
been
abstractedly
picking
out
the
lines
formed
by
the
grain
of
the
wood
in
the
table
top
closed
suddenly
into
fists
and
then
my
father
jimmie
dale
turned
away
his
head
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
the
old
sense
of
unreality
was
strong
upon
him
again
he
was
listening
to
the
tocsin
story
it
was
strange
that
he
should
be
doing
that
that
it
could
be
really
so
it
seemed
as
though
magically
he
had
been
transported
out
of
the
world
where
for
years
past
he
had
lived
with
danger
lurking
at
every
turn
where
men
set
watch
about
his
house
to
trap
him
where
the
denizens
of
the
underworld
yowled
like
starving
beasts
to
sink
their
fangs
in
him
where
the
police
were
ceaselessly
upon
his
trail
to
wreak
an
insensate
vengeance
upon
him
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
been
transported
away
from
all
that
to
something
that
he
had
dreamed
might
perhaps
sometime
happen
that
he
had
hoped
might
happen
that
he
had
longed
for
always
but
now
that
it
was
his
that
it
also
was
full
of
the
sense
of
the
unreal
and
yet
as
his
mind
followed
the
thread
of
her
story
and
leaped
ahead
and
vaguely
glimpsed
what
was
to
come
he
was
conscious
in
a
sort
of
premonitory
way
of
a
vaster
peril
than
any
he
had
ever
known
as
though
forces
for
the
moment
masked
were
arrayed
against
him
whose
strength
and
whose
malignity
were
beyond
human
parallel
in
what
a
strange
almost
incoherent
way
his
brain
was
working
he
roused
himself
a
little
and
looked
around
him
and
with
a
shock
the
starkness
of
the
room
the
abject
pitiful
air
of
destitution
brought
home
to
him
with
terrific
startling
force
the
significance
of
the
scene
in
which
he
was
playing
a
part
his
face
set
suddenly
in
hard
lines
that
she
should
have
been
brought
to
assume
such
a
life
as
this
forced
out
of
her
environment
of
wealth
and
refinement
forced
in
her
purity
to
rub
shoulders
with
the
vile
the
dissolute
forced
to
exist
as
such
a
creature
amid
the
crime
and
vice
the
wretched
horror
of
the
underworld
that
swirled
around
her
there
was
anger
now
upon
him
burning
hot
a
merciless
craving
that
was
a
savage
hungry
lust
for
vengeance
and
then
she
was
speaking
again
father
death
occurred
very
shortly
after
my
uncle
message
advising
us
to
postpone
our
trip
was
received
on
his
death
travers
very
naturally
as
father
lawyer
cabled
my
uncle
to
come
to
new
york
at
once
and
my
uncle
replied
saying
that
he
was
coming
by
the
first
she
paused
again
but
only
for
an
instant
as
though
to
frame
her
thoughts
in
words
i
have
told
you
that
i
had
never
seen
my
uncle
that
even
my
father
had
not
seen
him
for
twenty
years
and
i
have
told
you
that
the
man
you
know
as
henry
lasalle
is
an
impostor
i
am
using
the
word
now
when
i
refer
to
him
simply
to
avoid
confusion
you
are
perhaps
expecting
me
to
say
that
i
took
a
distinctive
dislike
to
him
from
the
moment
he
arrived
on
the
contrary
i
had
every
reason
to
be
predisposed
toward
him
and
indeed
was
rather
agreeably
surprised
than
otherwise
he
was
not
nearly
so
uncouth
and
unpolished
as
somehow
i
had
pictured
his
life
would
have
made
him
do
you
understand
jimmie
he
was
kind
sympathetic
and
in
an
apathetic
way
i
liked
him
i
say
because
i
think
that
best
describes
my
own
attitude
toward
every
one
and
everything
following
father
death
until
that
she
rose
abruptly
from
her
chair
as
though
a
passive
position
of
any
kind
had
suddenly
become
intolerable
why
tell
you
what
my
father
and
i
were
to
each
other
she
cried
out
in
a
low
passionate
voice
it
seemed
as
though
everything
that
meant
anything
had
gone
out
of
my
life
i
became
worn
out
nervous
and
though
the
days
were
bad
enough
the
nights
were
a
source
of
dread
i
began
to
suffer
from
insomnia
i
could
not
sleep
this
was
even
before
my
supposed
uncle
came
i
used
to
read
for
hours
and
hours
in
my
room
after
i
had
gone
to
bed
but
she
flung
out
her
hand
with
an
impatient
gesture
there
is
no
need
to
dwell
on
that
one
night
about
a
week
after
that
man
had
arrived
and
a
little
over
a
month
after
father
had
died
i
was
in
my
room
and
had
finished
a
book
i
was
reading
i
remember
that
it
was
well
after
midnight
i
had
not
the
slightest
inclination
to
sleep
i
picked
up
another
book
and
after
that
another
there
were
plenty
in
my
room
but
irrationally
of
course
none
pleased
me
i
decided
to
go
down
to
the
library
not
that
i
think
i
really
expected
to
find
anything
that
i
actually
wanted
but
more
because
it
was
an
impulse
and
furnished
me
for
the
moment
with
some
definite
objective
something
to
do
i
got
up
slipped
on
a
dressing
gown
and
went
downstairs
the
lights
were
all
out
i
was
just
on
the
point
of
switching
on
those
in
the
reception
hall
when
suddenly
it
seemed
as
though
i
had
not
strength
to
lift
my
hand
and
i
remember
that
for
an
instant
i
grew
terribly
cold
with
dread
and
fear
from
the
room
on
my
right
a
voice
had
reached
me
the
door
was
closed
but
the
voice
was
raised
in
an
outburst
of
profanity
i
i
could
hear
every
word
she
out
of
the
way
there
no
the
voice
snarled
wo
listen
to
anything
else
do
you
hear
why
you
fool
what
are
you
trying
to
do
hand
me
one
turn
everything
into
cash
and
divvy
and
beat
it
eh
and
i
the
goat
and
i
get
caught
and
get
twenty
years
for
stealing
trust
funds
and
the
rest
of
you
get
the
coin
he
swore
terribly
again
taken
the
risk
in
this
for
the
last
five
years
there
be
no
smart
aleck
lawyer
tricks
there
be
no
halfway
measures
and
who
are
you
to
dictate
she
goes
out
that
safe
i
inherit
as
next
of
kin
with
no
one
to
dispute
it
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
i
stood
there
and
could
not
move
it
was
the
voice
of
the
man
i
knew
as
my
uncle
my
heart
seemed
to
have
stopped
beating
i
tried
to
tell
myself
that
i
was
dreaming
that
it
was
too
horrible
too
incredible
to
be
real
that
they
could
not
really
mean
to
to
murder
me
and
then
i
recognised
hilton
travers
voice
am
not
dictating
and
you
are
not
serious
of
course
he
said
with
what
seemed
an
uneasy
laugh
am
only
warning
you
that
you
are
forgetting
to
take
the
real
henry
lasalle
into
account
he
is
bound
to
hear
of
this
eventually
and
then
another
voice
broke
in
one
i
did
not
recognise
talking
too
loud
both
of
you
travers
does
understand
but
he
to
be
wised
up
according
to
orders
and
the
voice
became
inaudible
muffled
i
could
not
hear
any
more
i
suppose
i
remained
there
another
three
or
four
minutes
too
stunned
to
know
what
to
do
and
then
i
ran
softly
along
the
hall
to
the
library
door
the
library
you
understand
was
at
the
rear
of
the
room
they
were
in
and
the
two
rooms
were
really
one
that
is
there
was
only
an
archway
between
them
i
can
not
tell
you
what
my
emotions
were
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
that
i
kept
repeating
to
myself
are
going
to
kill
me
they
are
going
to
kill
me
and
that
it
seemed
i
must
try
and
find
out
everything
everything
i
she
turned
away
from
the
table
and
began
to
pace
nervously
up
and
down
the
miserable
room
jimmie
dale
rose
impulsively
from
his
chair
but
she
waved
him
back
again
no
wait
she
said
let
me
finish
i
crept
into
the
library
it
took
me
a
long
time
because
i
had
to
be
so
careful
not
to
make
the
slightest
noise
i
suppose
it
was
fully
six
or
seven
minutes
from
the
time
i
had
first
heard
my
supposed
uncle
voice
until
i
had
crept
far
enough
forward
to
be
able
to
see
into
the
room
beyond
there
were
three
men
there
the
man
i
knew
as
my
uncle
was
sitting
at
one
end
of
the
table
another
had
his
back
toward
me
and
travers
was
facing
in
my
direction
and
i
think
i
never
saw
so
ghastly
a
face
as
was
hilton
travers
then
he
was
standing
up
sort
of
swaying
as
he
leaned
with
both
hands
on
the
table
then
travers
the
man
whose
back
was
turned
to
me
was
saying
threateningly
got
the
story
now
sign
those
papers
it
seemed
as
though
travers
could
not
speak
for
a
moment
he
kept
looking
wildly
from
one
to
the
other
he
was
white
to
the
lips
let
me
in
for
this
he
said
hoarsely
at
last
devils
you
devils
you
devils
you
let
me
in
for
murder
both
of
them
both
peter
and
his
brother
murdered
she
stopped
abruptly
before
jimmie
dale
and
clutched
his
arm
tightly
jimmie
i
do
know
why
i
did
not
scream
out
everything
went
black
for
a
moment
before
my
eyes
it
was
the
first
suspicion
i
had
had
that
my
father
had
met
with
foul
play
and
i
but
now
jimmie
dale
swayed
up
from
his
chair
murdered
he
exclaimed
tensely
your
father
but
but
i
remember
perfectly
there
was
no
hint
of
any
such
thing
at
the
time
and
never
has
been
since
he
died
from
quite
natural
she
looked
at
him
strangely
he
died
from
inoculation
she
said
did
did
you
not
see
something
of
that
laboratory
in
the
crime
club
yourself
the
night
before
last
enough
to
understand
good
god
muttered
jimmie
dale
in
a
startled
way
then
go
on
go
on
what
happened
then
she
passed
her
hand
a
little
wearily
across
her
eyes
and
sank
down
into
her
chair
again
travers
she
continued
picking
up
the
thread
of
her
story
had
raised
his
voice
and
the
third
man
at
the
table
leaned
suddenly
aggressively
toward
him
your
tongue
he
growled
furiously
you
asked
to
do
is
sign
the
papers
not
talk
travers
shook
his
head
wo
he
cried
out
wo
have
any
hand
in
another
murder
in
hers
my
god
i
wo
i
wo
i
tell
you
it
horrible
here
you
fool
the
man
who
was
posing
as
my
uncle
broke
in
then
in
this
too
deep
to
get
out
now
if
you
know
what
good
for
you
you
do
as
you
told
jimmie
i
shall
never
forget
travers
face
it
seemed
to
have
changed
from
white
to
gray
and
there
was
horror
in
his
eyes
and
then
he
seemed
to
lose
all
control
of
himself
shaking
his
fists
in
their
faces
cursing
them
in
utter
abandon
bad
he
cried
gone
everything
everything
but
the
limit
everything
but
murder
i
stop
there
i
have
no
more
to
do
with
this
i
through
you
you
pulled
me
into
this
and
and
i
know
you
know
now
the
third
man
sneered
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
going
to
see
that
no
harm
comes
to
marie
lasalle
travers
answered
in
a
dull
way
the
other
man
now
was
on
his
feet
and
i
do
not
know
quite
how
to
express
it
jimmie
he
seemed
ominously
quiet
in
both
his
voice
and
his
movements
better
think
that
over
again
travers
he
said
you
mean
it
mean
it
travers
said
mean
it
god
help
me
may
well
add
that
returned
the
other
with
an
ugly
laugh
he
reached
out
his
hand
toward
the
telephone
on
the
table
you
know
what
will
happen
to
you
if
i
telephone
a
certain
number
and
say
that
you
have
turned
traitor
have
to
take
my
chances
travers
replied
doggedly
through
them
then
flung
out
the
other
have
little
time
given
you
to
do
us
any
harm
travers
did
not
answer
i
think
he
almost
expected
an
attack
upon
him
then
from
the
two
men
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
backed
slowly
toward
the
door
what
happened
in
the
next
few
moments
in
that
room
i
do
not
know
i
stole
out
of
the
library
i
was
obsessed
with
the
thought
that
i
must
see
travers
see
him
at
all
costs
before
he
got
away
from
the
house
i
reached
the
end
of
the
hall
as
the
room
door
opened
and
he
came
out
it
was
dark
as
i
said
and
i
could
not
see
distinctly
but
i
could
make
out
his
form
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
then
i
called
his
name
in
a
whisper
he
took
a
quick
step
toward
me
then
turned
and
hurried
toward
the
front
door
and
i
thought
he
was
going
away
but
the
next
instant
i
understood
his
ruse
he
opened
the
front
door
shut
it
again
quite
loudly
and
crept
back
to
me
me
somewhere
where
we
will
be
safe
quick
he
whispered
there
was
only
one
place
where
i
was
sure
we
would
be
safe
i
led
him
to
the
rear
of
the
house
and
up
the
servants
stairs
and
to
my
she
broke
off
abruptly
and
once
more
rose
from
her
chair
and
once
more
began
to
pace
the
room
back
in
his
chair
jimmie
dale
tense
and
motionless
now
watched
her
without
a
word
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
you
all
that
passed
between
us
she
went
on
hurriedly
the
man
was
frankly
a
criminal
but
not
to
the
extent
of
murder
and
in
that
respect
at
least
he
was
honest
with
himself
almost
the
first
words
he
said
to
me
were
lasalle
i
am
as
good
as
a
dead
man
if
i
am
caught
by
the
devils
behind
those
two
men
downstairs
and
then
he
began
to
plead
with
me
to
make
my
own
escape
he
did
not
know
who
the
man
was
that
was
posing
as
my
uncle
had
never
seen
him
before
until
he
presented
himself
as
henry
lasalle
the
other
man
he
knew
as
clarke
but
knew
also
that
was
merely
an
assumed
name
he
had
fallen
in
with
clarke
almost
from
the
time
that
he
had
begun
to
practise
his
profession
and
at
clarke
instigation
had
gone
from
one
crooked
deal
to
another
and
had
made
a
great
deal
of
money
he
knew
that
behind
clarke
was
a
powerful
daring
and
unscrupulous
band
of
criminals
organised
on
a
gigantic
scale
of
which
he
himself
was
in
a
sense
a
probationary
sense
as
he
put
it
a
member
but
he
had
never
come
into
direct
contact
with
them
he
had
received
all
his
orders
and
instructions
through
clarke
he
had
been
told
by
clarke
that
he
was
to
cultivate
father
following
the
introduction
to
win
father
confidence
to
get
as
many
of
father
affairs
into
his
hands
as
possible
to
reach
the
position
in
fact
of
becoming
father
recognised
attorney
and
all
this
with
the
object
as
he
supposed
of
embezzling
from
father
on
a
large
scale
then
father
died
and
travers
was
instructed
to
cable
my
uncle
he
knew
that
the
man
who
answered
that
summons
was
an
impostor
but
he
did
not
know
until
they
had
admitted
it
to
him
that
night
that
both
my
father
and
my
uncle
had
been
murdered
and
that
i
too
was
to
be
made
away
she
looked
at
jimmie
dale
and
suddenly
laughed
out
bitterly
no
you
do
understand
even
yet
the
patient
ingenious
deviltry
of
those
fiends
it
was
they
at
the
time
the
new
will
was
drawn
who
offered
to
buy
out
my
real
uncle
sheep
ranch
in
that
lonely
unsettled
district
in
australia
and
offered
him
that
new
position
in
new
zealand
my
uncle
never
reached
new
zealand
he
was
murdered
on
his
way
there
and
in
his
place
assuming
his
name
appeared
the
man
who
has
been
posing
as
my
uncle
ever
since
do
you
begin
to
see
for
five
years
they
were
patiently
working
out
their
plans
for
five
years
before
my
father
death
that
man
lived
and
became
known
and
accepted
and
established
himself
as
henry
lasalle
do
you
see
now
why
he
cabled
us
to
postpone
our
visit
he
ran
very
little
risk
the
chances
were
one
in
a
thousand
that
any
of
his
few
acquaintances
in
australia
would
ever
run
across
him
in
new
zealand
and
besides
he
was
chosen
because
it
seems
there
was
a
slight
resemblance
between
him
and
the
real
henry
lasalle
enough
with
his
changed
mode
of
living
and
more
elaborate
and
pretentious
surroundings
to
have
enabled
him
to
carry
through
a
bluff
had
it
become
necessary
he
had
all
of
my
uncle
papers
and
the
crime
club
furnished
him
with
every
detail
of
our
lives
here
i
forgot
to
say
too
that
from
the
moment
my
uncle
was
supposed
to
have
reached
new
zealand
all
his
letters
were
typewritten
an
evidence
in
father
eyes
that
his
brother
had
secured
a
position
of
some
importance
as
indeed
from
apparently
unprejudiced
sources
they
took
pains
to
assure
father
was
a
fact
this
left
them
with
only
my
uncle
signature
to
forge
to
the
letters
not
a
difficult
matter
for
them
believing
that
they
had
travers
so
deeply
implicated
that
he
could
do
nothing
even
if
he
had
the
inclination
which
they
had
not
for
a
moment
imagined
and
arrogant
in
the
belief
in
their
own
power
to
put
him
out
of
the
way
in
any
case
if
he
proved
refractory
they
admitted
all
this
to
him
that
night
when
he
brought
up
the
issue
of
the
real
henry
lasalle
putting
in
an
appearance
sooner
or
later
and
when
they
wanted
him
to
smooth
their
path
by
releasing
all
documents
where
his
power
of
attorney
was
involved
do
you
see
now
the
part
they
gave
travers
to
play
it
was
to
put
the
stamp
of
genuineness
upon
the
false
henry
lasalle
not
but
that
they
were
prepared
with
what
would
appear
to
be
overwhelmingly
convincing
evidence
to
prove
it
if
it
were
necessary
but
if
the
man
were
accepted
by
the
estate
lawyer
there
was
little
chance
of
any
one
else
questioning
his
she
halted
again
by
the
table
and
forced
a
smile
as
her
eyes
met
jimmie
dale
i
am
almost
through
jimmie
that
night
was
a
terrible
one
for
both
of
us
travers
life
was
not
worth
a
moment
purchase
once
they
found
him
and
mine
was
only
under
reprieve
until
sufficient
time
to
obviate
suspicion
should
have
elapsed
after
father
death
we
had
no
proof
that
would
stand
in
any
court
even
if
we
should
have
been
given
the
chance
to
adopt
that
course
and
without
absolute
irrefutable
proof
it
was
all
so
cleverly
woven
stretched
over
so
many
years
that
our
charge
must
have
been
held
to
be
too
visionary
and
fantastic
to
have
any
basis
in
fact
all
travers
would
have
been
able
to
advance
was
the
statement
that
the
supposed
henry
lasalle
had
admitted
being
an
impostor
and
a
murderer
to
him
who
would
believe
it
on
the
face
of
it
it
appeared
to
be
an
absurdity
and
even
granted
that
we
were
given
an
opportunity
to
bring
the
charge
they
would
be
able
to
prove
by
a
hundred
influential
and
men
in
new
zealand
that
the
impostor
was
really
henry
lasalle
and
were
we
able
to
find
any
of
my
uncle
old
acquaintances
in
australia
it
would
be
necessary
to
get
them
here
and
not
one
of
them
would
have
reached
america
alive
but
there
was
not
a
chance
not
a
chance
jimmie
of
doing
that
they
would
have
killed
travers
the
moment
he
showed
himself
in
the
open
the
only
thing
we
could
do
that
night
was
to
try
and
save
our
own
lives
the
only
thing
we
could
look
forward
to
was
acquiring
in
some
way
unknown
to
them
the
proof
fully
established
with
which
we
could
crush
them
in
a
single
stroke
and
before
they
would
have
time
to
strike
back
the
vital
thing
was
proof
of
my
uncle
death
that
if
it
could
be
obtained
at
all
could
only
be
obtained
in
australia
travers
was
obliged
to
go
somewhere
to
disappear
from
that
moment
if
he
wanted
to
save
his
life
and
he
volunteered
to
go
out
there
he
left
the
house
that
night
by
the
back
entrance
in
an
old
servant
suit
which
i
found
for
him
and
i
never
heard
from
him
again
until
a
month
ago
in
the
column
of
the
morning
through
which
we
had
agreed
to
communicate
as
for
myself
i
left
the
house
the
next
morning
telling
my
pseudo
uncle
that
i
was
going
to
spend
a
few
days
with
a
friend
and
this
i
actually
did
but
in
those
few
days
i
managed
to
turn
all
my
own
securities
that
had
been
left
me
by
my
mother
and
which
amounted
to
a
considerable
sum
into
cash
and
then
jimmie
i
came
to
this
i
have
lived
like
this
and
in
different
disguises
as
a
settlement
worker
as
a
widow
of
means
in
a
fashionable
uptown
apartment
but
mostly
as
you
see
me
now
for
five
years
for
five
years
i
have
watched
my
supposed
uncle
hoping
praying
that
through
him
i
could
get
to
know
the
others
associated
with
him
hoping
praying
that
travers
would
succeed
hoping
praying
that
we
would
get
them
all
and
watching
day
after
day
and
year
after
year
the
column
of
the
paper
until
at
last
i
began
to
be
afraid
that
it
was
all
useless
and
there
was
nothing
jimmie
nothing
anywhere
and
i
had
no
success
her
voice
choked
a
little
nothing
even
clarke
never
went
again
to
the
house
you
can
understand
now
how
i
came
to
know
the
strange
things
that
i
wrote
to
the
gray
seal
how
the
life
that
i
have
led
how
this
life
here
in
the
underworld
how
the
constant
search
for
some
clew
on
my
own
account
brought
them
to
my
knowledge
and
you
can
understand
now
too
why
i
never
dared
to
let
you
meet
me
for
i
knew
well
enough
that
while
i
worked
to
undermine
my
father
and
my
uncle
murderers
they
were
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
find
me
that
is
all
jimmie
the
day
before
yesterday
a
month
after
first
message
to
let
me
know
that
he
was
coming
there
was
another
giving
me
an
hour
and
a
telephone
number
he
was
back
he
had
everything
everything
we
dared
not
meet
he
was
afraid
suspicious
that
they
had
got
track
of
him
again
you
know
the
rest
that
package
contained
the
proof
that
with
travers
death
can
probably
never
be
obtained
again
do
you
understand
why
they
want
it
why
it
is
life
and
death
to
me
do
you
understand
why
my
supposed
uncle
offered
huge
rewards
for
me
why
secretly
every
resource
of
that
hideous
organisation
has
been
employed
to
find
me
that
it
is
only
by
my
death
the
estate
can
pass
into
their
hands
and
now
she
flung
out
her
hands
suddenly
toward
jimmie
dale
oh
jimmie
jimmie
i
i
fought
so
long
alone
jimmie
what
are
we
to
do
he
came
slowly
to
his
feet
she
had
fought
so
long
alone
but
now
now
it
was
his
turn
to
fight
for
her
but
how
she
had
not
told
him
all
surely
she
had
not
told
him
all
for
everything
depended
upon
that
package
there
had
been
so
much
to
tell
that
she
had
not
thought
of
all
and
she
had
not
told
him
the
details
about
that
that
box
no
he
cried
quickly
what
is
that
what
does
it
mean
she
shook
her
head
i
do
not
know
she
answered
then
who
is
this
john
johansson
i
do
not
know
she
said
again
nor
where
the
crime
club
is
no
dully
he
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
in
a
dazed
way
my
god
jimmie
dale
murmured
and
then
she
turned
away
her
head
it
it
pretty
bad
is
it
jimmie
i
i
told
you
that
we
did
not
hold
many
chapter
x
silver
mag
there
was
silence
between
them
minute
after
minute
passed
neither
spoke
jimmie
dale
dropped
back
into
his
chair
again
and
stared
abstractedly
before
him
we
do
not
hold
many
trumps
jimmie
we
do
not
hold
many
trumps
her
words
were
repeating
themselves
over
and
over
in
his
mind
they
seemed
to
challenge
him
mockingly
to
deny
what
was
so
obviously
a
fact
and
because
he
could
not
deny
it
to
taunt
and
jeer
at
him
to
jeer
at
him
when
all
that
was
held
at
stake
hung
literally
upon
his
next
move
he
looked
up
mechanically
as
the
tocsin
walked
to
a
broken
mirror
at
the
rear
of
the
miserable
room
nodded
mechanically
in
approval
as
she
began
deftly
to
retouch
the
on
her
face
where
the
tears
had
left
their
traces
and
resumed
his
abstracted
gaze
before
him
box
number
john
johansson
the
crime
club
the
identity
of
the
man
who
was
posing
as
henry
lasalle
if
only
he
could
hit
upon
a
clew
to
the
solution
of
a
single
one
of
those
things
or
a
single
phase
of
one
of
them
if
only
he
could
glimpse
a
ray
of
light
that
would
at
least
prompt
action
when
every
moment
of
inaction
was
multiplying
the
odds
against
them
there
were
the
men
who
were
watching
his
house
at
that
moment
on
riverside
drive
he
as
larry
the
bat
might
in
turn
keep
watch
on
them
he
had
though
of
that
in
time
perhaps
he
might
by
so
doing
discover
the
whereabouts
of
the
crime
club
in
time
it
was
just
that
he
had
no
time
hours
the
tocsin
insisted
was
all
the
time
that
he
could
count
upon
before
they
would
become
suspicious
of
jimmie
illness
before
they
would
discover
that
they
were
watching
an
empty
house
he
might
though
this
was
even
more
hazardous
make
an
attempt
to
trace
the
wires
that
tapped
those
of
his
telephone
through
the
basement
window
that
gave
on
the
garage
driveway
and
what
then
true
they
could
not
lead
very
far
away
but
even
if
successful
what
then
they
would
not
lead
him
to
the
crime
club
but
simply
to
some
confederate
to
some
man
or
woman
playing
the
part
of
a
servant
perhaps
in
the
house
next
door
who
in
turn
would
have
to
be
shadowed
and
watched
jimmie
dale
shook
his
head
better
of
the
two
to
start
in
at
once
and
shadow
those
who
were
shadowing
his
house
but
that
was
not
the
way
he
knew
that
intuitively
he
hated
to
eliminate
it
from
consideration
for
he
had
no
other
move
to
take
its
place
but
such
a
move
was
almost
suicide
in
itself
time
and
time
alone
was
the
vital
factor
they
the
tocsin
and
he
must
act
quickly
and
strike
that
night
if
they
were
to
win
his
fingers
the
grimy
fingers
of
larry
the
bat
that
none
now
would
recognise
as
the
slim
tapering
wonderfully
sensitive
fingers
of
jimmie
dale
the
fingers
that
had
made
the
name
of
the
gray
seal
famous
whose
tips
mocked
at
bars
and
safes
and
locks
and
seemed
to
embody
in
themselves
all
the
human
senses
tightened
spasmodically
on
the
edge
of
the
table
time
time
time
it
seemed
to
din
in
his
ears
and
while
he
sat
there
powerless
impotent
the
crime
club
was
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
find
what
he
must
find
that
package
if
he
was
to
save
this
woman
here
the
woman
whom
he
loved
she
who
had
been
forced
through
the
machinations
of
these
hell
fiends
to
adopt
the
life
of
a
wretched
hag
to
exist
among
the
dregs
of
the
underworld
whose
squalour
and
vice
and
wantonness
none
knew
better
than
he
jimmie
dale
face
set
grimly
somewhere
somewhere
in
the
past
five
years
of
this
life
of
hers
in
which
she
had
been
fighting
the
crime
club
pitting
that
clever
brain
of
hers
against
it
must
lie
a
clew
she
had
told
him
her
story
only
in
baldest
outline
with
scarcely
a
reference
to
her
own
personal
acts
with
barely
a
single
detail
there
must
be
something
something
that
perhaps
she
had
overlooked
something
just
the
merest
hint
of
something
that
would
supply
a
starting
point
give
him
a
glimmer
of
light
she
came
back
from
across
the
room
and
sank
down
in
her
chair
again
she
did
not
speak
the
question
that
meant
life
and
death
to
them
both
was
in
her
eyes
jimmie
answered
the
mute
interrogation
tersely
not
yet
he
said
then
almost
curtly
in
a
quick
incisive
way
as
the
keen
alert
brain
began
to
delve
and
probe
you
say
this
man
clarke
never
returned
to
the
house
after
that
night
she
nodded
her
head
quietly
you
are
sure
of
that
he
insisted
yes
she
said
i
am
and
you
say
that
all
these
years
you
have
kept
a
watch
on
the
man
who
is
posing
as
your
uncle
and
that
he
never
went
anywhere
or
associated
with
any
one
that
would
afford
you
a
clew
to
this
crime
club
yes
she
said
again
it
was
a
moment
before
jimmie
dale
spoke
it
very
strange
he
said
musingly
at
last
so
strange
in
fact
that
it
impossible
he
must
have
communicated
with
the
others
and
communicated
with
them
often
the
game
they
were
playing
was
too
big
too
full
of
details
to
admit
of
any
other
possibility
and
the
telephone
as
an
explanation
is
good
and
yet
she
said
earnestly
possible
or
impossible
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
he
might
have
succeeded
in
eluding
me
on
occasions
was
perhaps
to
be
expected
but
that
in
all
those
years
i
should
not
catch
him
once
in
what
if
you
are
correct
must
have
been
many
and
repeated
conferences
with
the
same
men
is
too
improbable
to
be
thought
of
jimmie
dale
shook
his
head
again
if
you
had
been
able
to
watch
him
night
and
day
that
might
be
so
he
said
crisply
but
at
best
you
could
only
watch
him
a
very
small
portion
of
the
she
smiled
at
him
a
little
wanly
do
you
think
jimmie
from
what
you
as
the
gray
seal
know
of
me
that
i
would
have
watched
in
any
haphazard
way
like
that
he
glanced
at
her
with
a
sudden
start
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
quickly
look
at
me
she
said
quietly
have
you
ever
seen
me
before
i
mean
as
i
am
no
he
answered
after
an
instant
not
that
i
know
and
yet
she
smiled
wanly
again
you
have
not
lived
or
made
the
place
you
hold
in
the
underworld
without
having
heard
of
silver
you
exclaimed
jimmie
dale
you
silver
mag
he
stared
at
her
wonderingly
as
now
the
hair
straggling
out
from
under
the
hood
of
a
faded
cloak
she
sat
before
him
a
typical
creature
of
the
underworld
her
role
an
art
in
its
conception
perfect
in
its
execution
silver
mag
yes
he
had
heard
of
silver
mag
as
every
one
in
the
bad
lands
had
heard
of
her
silver
mag
and
her
pocketful
of
coin
always
a
pocketful
of
silver
so
they
said
that
was
dispensed
prodigally
to
the
wives
and
children
temporarily
deprived
of
support
by
husbands
and
fathers
unfortunate
enough
in
their
clashes
with
the
law
to
be
doing
spaces
up
the
river
and
therefore
the
underworld
swore
by
silver
mag
always
silver
never
a
bill
silver
mag
had
never
been
seen
with
a
banknote
that
was
her
eccentricity
much
or
little
she
gave
or
paid
out
of
her
pocketful
of
jangling
silver
she
was
credited
with
being
a
sworn
enemy
of
the
police
and
yes
he
remembered
too
with
having
done
time
herself
i
do
quite
understand
he
said
in
a
puzzled
way
i
have
run
across
you
personally
because
you
probably
took
care
to
see
that
i
should
but
it
no
secret
every
one
says
served
a
jail
sentence
that
is
simply
enough
explained
she
answered
gravely
the
story
is
of
my
own
making
when
i
decided
to
adopt
this
life
both
for
my
own
safety
and
as
the
best
means
of
keeping
a
watch
on
that
man
i
knew
that
i
must
win
the
confidence
of
the
underworld
that
i
must
have
help
and
that
in
order
to
obtain
that
help
i
must
have
some
excuse
for
my
enmity
against
the
man
known
as
henry
lasalle
to
be
widely
known
in
the
underworld
was
of
inestimable
value
nothing
i
knew
could
accomplish
that
as
quickly
as
eccentricity
you
see
now
how
and
why
i
became
known
as
silver
mag
i
gained
the
confidence
of
every
crook
in
new
york
through
their
wives
and
children
i
told
them
the
story
of
my
jail
sentence
while
i
swore
vengeance
on
henry
lasalle
i
told
them
that
he
had
had
me
arrested
for
something
i
never
stole
while
i
was
working
for
him
as
a
charwoman
and
that
he
had
had
me
railroaded
to
jail
there
was
one
but
gave
me
credit
for
the
theft
perhaps
but
equally
there
was
one
but
understood
and
my
eccentricity
helped
this
out
my
wanting
to
henry
lasalle
well
do
you
see
now
jimmie
i
had
money
i
had
the
confidence
of
the
underworld
i
had
an
excuse
for
my
hatred
of
henry
lasalle
and
so
i
had
all
the
help
i
wanted
day
and
night
that
man
has
been
watched
he
receives
no
visitors
what
social
life
he
has
is
as
you
know
at
the
club
there
is
not
a
house
that
he
has
ever
entered
that
sooner
or
later
i
have
not
entered
after
him
in
the
hope
of
finding
the
headquarters
of
the
clique
even
the
men
and
women
as
far
as
human
possibility
could
accomplish
it
that
he
has
talked
to
on
the
streets
have
been
shadowed
and
their
identity
satisfactorily
established
and
the
net
result
has
been
failure
utter
absolute
complete
failure
jimmie
dale
eyes
that
had
held
steadily
on
her
face
shifted
troubled
and
perplexed
to
the
table
top
you
are
wonderful
he
said
under
his
breath
wonderful
and
and
that
makes
it
all
the
more
amazing
all
the
more
incomprehensible
it
is
still
impossible
that
he
has
not
been
in
close
and
constant
touch
with
his
accomplices
he
must
have
been
we
would
be
blind
fools
to
argue
against
it
it
could
not
on
the
face
of
it
have
been
otherwise
then
how
when
where
has
he
done
it
she
asked
wearily
god
knows
he
said
bitterly
and
if
they
have
been
clever
enough
to
escape
you
all
these
years
i
almost
inclined
to
say
what
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
we
she
watched
him
miserably
as
he
pushed
back
his
chair
impulsively
and
standing
up
stared
down
at
her
we
against
it
hard
he
said
with
a
mirthless
laugh
then
his
lips
tightening
but
we
try
another
tack
the
chauffeur
travers
though
even
here
the
crime
club
has
a
day
start
of
us
even
if
last
night
they
knew
no
more
about
the
whereabouts
of
that
package
than
we
know
now
i
afraid
of
it
the
chances
are
more
than
even
that
already
got
it
if
they
were
able
to
catch
travers
as
the
chauffeur
they
would
have
had
something
tangible
to
work
back
from
jimmie
dale
was
talking
more
to
himself
than
to
the
tocsin
now
as
though
he
were
muttering
his
thoughts
aloud
how
did
they
get
track
of
him
when
where
what
has
it
led
to
and
what
in
heaven
name
he
burst
out
suddenly
is
this
box
number
a
vault
perhaps
that
he
has
taken
somewhere
she
hazarded
jimmie
dale
laughed
mirthlessly
again
that
is
the
one
definite
thing
i
do
know
that
it
is
he
said
positively
it
is
nothing
of
that
kind
it
was
ten
at
night
when
i
met
him
and
he
said
that
he
had
intended
going
back
for
the
package
if
it
had
been
safe
to
do
so
deposit
vaults
are
not
open
at
that
hour
the
package
is
or
was
if
they
have
not
already
got
it
readily
accessible
and
at
any
hour
now
go
over
everything
again
every
detail
that
passed
between
you
and
travers
he
let
you
know
that
he
was
back
in
new
york
by
means
of
a
you
said
what
else
was
in
that
besides
the
telephone
number
and
the
hour
you
were
to
call
him
anything
nothing
that
will
help
us
any
she
replied
colourlessly
there
were
simply
the
words
corner
of
sixth
avenue
and
waverly
place
and
the
signature
that
we
had
agreed
upon
the
two
first
and
two
last
letters
of
the
alphabet
transposed
i
see
said
jimmie
dale
quickly
and
over
the
he
completed
his
message
clever
enough
yes
she
said
in
that
way
if
any
one
were
listening
or
overhead
the
plan
there
could
be
little
harm
come
of
it
for
the
essential
feature
of
all
the
place
of
rendezvous
was
not
mentioned
it
has
not
been
travers
fault
that
this
happened
and
in
spite
of
every
precaution
it
has
cost
him
his
life
he
wanted
nothing
to
give
them
a
clew
to
my
whereabouts
he
was
trying
to
guard
against
the
slightest
evidence
that
would
associate
us
one
with
the
other
he
even
warned
me
over
the
not
to
tell
him
how
where
or
the
mode
of
life
i
was
living
and
naturally
he
dared
give
me
no
particulars
about
himself
i
was
simply
to
select
a
third
party
whom
i
could
trust
and
to
follow
out
his
instructions
which
were
those
that
i
sent
to
you
in
my
jimmie
dale
began
to
pace
nervously
up
and
down
the
room
nothing
else
he
queried
a
little
blankly
nothing
else
she
said
monotonously
but
since
last
night
since
you
knew
that
things
had
gone
wrong
he
persisted
surely
you
traced
that
telephone
number
the
one
you
called
up
yes
she
said
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
a
tired
way
naturally
i
did
that
but
like
everything
else
it
amounted
to
nothing
he
telephoned
from
makoff
pawnshop
on
that
alley
off
thompson
street
and
where
jimmie
dale
suddenly
almost
shouted
the
word
he
telephoned
from
where
say
that
again
she
looked
at
him
in
amazement
half
rising
from
her
chair
jimmie
what
is
it
she
cried
you
do
mean
that
he
was
beside
her
now
his
hands
pressed
upon
her
shoulders
his
face
flushed
box
number
he
laughed
out
hysterically
in
his
excitement
john
johansson
box
number
and
like
a
fool
i
never
thought
of
it
do
you
see
do
you
know
now
yourself
the
underground
post
office
she
stood
up
clinging
to
him
a
wild
relief
that
was
based
on
her
confidence
in
him
in
her
eyes
and
face
even
while
she
shook
her
head
no
she
said
frantically
no
i
do
not
know
tell
me
jimmie
tell
me
quickly
you
mean
at
makoff
no
not
makoff
at
spider
jack
on
thompson
street
he
was
clipping
off
his
words
still
holding
her
tightly
by
the
shoulders
still
staring
into
her
eyes
you
know
spider
jack
jack
little
novelty
store
ah
you
have
not
learned
all
of
the
underworld
yet
spider
jack
is
the
craftiest
in
the
bad
lands
and
makoff
is
his
partner
spider
buys
the
crooks
stuff
and
makoff
disposes
of
it
through
the
pawnshop
it
only
a
step
through
the
connecting
back
yard
from
one
to
the
other
and
yes
but
she
interrupted
feverishly
the
package
you
said
wait
jimmie
dale
cried
i
coming
to
that
if
travers
stood
in
with
makoff
he
stood
in
with
spider
jack
for
years
spider
has
been
a
sort
of
clearing
house
for
the
underworld
for
years
he
has
conducted
and
profitably
too
his
underground
post
office
crooks
from
all
over
the
country
let
alone
those
in
new
york
communicate
with
each
other
through
spider
jack
these
for
a
fee
are
registered
at
spider
and
given
a
number
a
box
number
he
calls
it
though
of
course
there
are
no
actual
boxes
letters
come
by
mail
addressed
to
him
the
sealed
envelope
within
containing
the
actually
intended
recipient
name
these
spider
either
forwards
or
delivers
in
person
when
they
are
called
for
dozens
of
crooks
too
unwilling
perhaps
to
dispose
of
small
articles
at
ruinous
prices
and
finding
it
unhealthy
for
the
moment
to
keep
them
in
their
possession
use
this
means
of
depositing
them
temporarily
for
you
see
now
do
you
it
certain
that
where
travers
left
the
package
he
used
the
name
of
john
johansson
not
to
hoodwink
spider
jack
i
should
say
but
as
an
added
safeguard
against
the
crime
club
travers
must
have
known
both
makoff
and
spider
jack
in
the
old
days
and
probably
had
reason
and
good
reason
to
trust
them
both
possibly
a
crook
then
himself
as
he
confessed
he
may
have
acted
in
a
legal
capacity
for
them
in
their
frequent
tangles
with
the
then
she
said
and
there
was
a
glad
new
note
in
her
voice
then
jimmie
jimmie
we
are
safe
you
can
get
it
jimmie
it
is
only
a
little
thing
for
the
gray
seal
to
do
to
get
it
now
that
we
know
where
it
yes
he
said
tersely
yes
if
it
is
still
still
there
she
repeated
the
words
quickly
nervously
still
there
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
if
they
too
have
not
discovered
that
he
was
at
makoff
if
they
have
not
got
there
first
he
said
grimly
there
seems
to
be
no
limit
to
their
cleverness
or
their
power
they
penetrated
his
disguise
as
a
chauffeur
and
who
knows
what
more
they
have
learned
since
last
night
we
are
fighting
them
in
the
dark
and
what
that
he
whispered
tensely
suddenly
and
leaning
forward
like
a
flash
as
he
whipped
his
automatic
from
his
pocket
he
blew
out
the
lamp
the
room
was
in
darkness
they
stood
there
rigid
silent
listening
her
hand
found
and
caught
his
arm
and
then
it
came
again
a
low
sound
the
sound
of
a
stealthy
footstep
just
outside
the
window
that
faced
on
the
storage
yard
chapter
xi
the
magpie
a
minute
passed
another
the
automatic
at
jimmie
dale
hip
the
muzzle
just
peeping
over
the
table
top
held
a
steady
bead
on
the
window
came
the
footstep
again
and
then
suddenly
a
series
of
low
quick
tappings
upon
the
windowpane
the
tocsin
hand
slipped
away
from
his
arm
jimmie
dale
set
face
relaxed
as
he
read
the
underground
morse
and
he
replaced
his
revolver
slowly
in
his
pocket
the
magpie
said
jimmie
dale
in
an
undertone
what
he
want
i
do
know
she
answered
in
a
whisper
he
never
came
here
before
there
a
back
way
out
jimmie
if
you
no
he
said
quickly
we
enemies
enough
with
out
making
one
of
the
magpie
he
knows
some
one
is
here
with
you
our
shadows
were
on
the
blind
do
queer
yourself
let
him
in
i
light
the
he
struck
a
match
as
she
ran
from
the
room
and
lifting
the
hot
lamp
chimney
with
the
edge
of
his
ragged
coat
lighted
the
lamp
he
turned
the
wick
down
a
little
shading
and
dimming
the
room
and
then
as
he
flirted
a
bead
of
moisture
from
his
forehead
whimsically
stretched
out
his
hand
to
watch
it
in
the
lamplight
that
bad
jimmie
he
muttered
gravely
to
himself
as
he
noted
an
almost
imperceptible
tremour
got
a
start
did
you
under
a
bit
of
a
strain
eh
well
grimly
never
mind
it
looks
as
though
the
luck
had
turned
makoff
and
spider
jack
his
hand
reached
up
to
his
hat
jerked
the
brim
at
a
rakish
angle
over
his
eyes
and
he
sprawled
himself
out
on
a
chair
he
heard
the
voice
at
the
front
door
and
a
man
voice
low
and
guarded
answer
her
then
the
door
closed
and
their
steps
approached
the
room
it
was
rather
curious
that
a
visit
from
the
magpie
what
could
the
magpie
want
what
could
there
be
in
common
between
the
magpie
and
silver
mag
the
magpie
alias
slimmy
joe
was
counted
the
cleverest
safe
worker
in
the
united
states
barring
only
and
always
one
a
smile
flickered
across
the
lips
of
larry
the
bat
one
whose
the
magpie
much
to
his
own
chagrin
admitted
himself
the
gray
seal
he
looked
up
twisting
the
stub
of
a
cigarette
between
his
grimy
fingers
and
fumbling
for
a
match
as
the
tocsin
and
behind
her
the
magpie
short
slim
and
wiry
with
sharp
little
black
eyes
entered
the
room

grinned

magpie

windowpane

jimmie

ungraciously
speaking
through
the
corner
of
his
mouth

said
the
magpie
unconcernedly
he
stared
about
him
and
finally
drawing
a
chair
up
to
the
table
sat
down
motioned
the
tocsin
to
do
the
same
and
leaned
forward
amiably

hand
clenched
suddenly
but
not
a
muscle
of
his
face

with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
he
shifted
the
butt

from

lower
lip

the
other
corner
of
his
mouth

wot

do
fer

century
the
magpie
hitched
his
chair
closer
to
the
table
and
as
his
sharp
little
ferret
eyes
glanced
around
the
room
motioned
the
two
to
brings
their
heads
nearer
one
of
me
influential
broker
friends
down
on
wall
street
put
me
wise
he
said
with
a
wink
dat

enough
fer
youse

as
far
as
dat
goes
but
take

from
me

he
lowered
his
voice
say
he
one
of
de
richest
mugs
in
new
york
ai
he
well
he
been
sellin
stocks
an
bonds
all
day
an
of
worth
fer
all
dem
is
always
sold
fer
cash
remarked
larry
the
bat
fatuously
aw
ferget
it
said
the
magpie
earnestly
fer
cash
i
said
de
coin
de
long
green
understand
he
was
shovin
no
checks
fer
what
he
sold
into
de
bank
except
to
get
dem
cashed
dat
wot
he
been
doin
all
day
gettin
de
checks
cashed
an
gettin
de
money
in
big
bills
see
i
know
of
one
bunch
of
eighty
an
dat
only
one
wot
fer
inquired
larry
the
bat
it
was
the
question
that
was
pounding
at
his
brain
as
he
stared
innocently
at
the
magpie
what
did
it
mean
why
was
henry
lasalle
turning
and
if
the
magpie
was
right
feverishly
turning
every
security
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
into
cash
and
then
in
a
flash
the
answer
came
they
had
not
found
the
package
equally
to
them
as
to
the
tocsin
sitting
there
before
him
it
meant
life
and
death
if
the
package
were
found
by
the
tocsin
instead
of
themselves
the
game
was
up
they
were
preparing
for
eventualities
if
they
were
forced
to
run
at
a
moment
notice
they
at
least
were
not
going
to
run
far
from
it
seemed
it
would
not
be
difficult
for
the
estate
executor
to
realise
a
vast
sum
in
short
order
on
instantly
marketable
securities
say
half
a
million
dollars
not
very
bulky
either
in
large
bills
five
thousand
bills
would
make
half
a
million
it
was
astonishing
how
small
a
hand
bag
say
might
hold
a
fortune
wot
fer
slimmy
he
inquired
again
wiggling
his
cigarette
butt
on
his
tongue
tip
wot
he
do
dat
fer
how
de
hell
do
youse
suppose
i
knows
demanded
the
magpie
politely
scornful
dat
his
business
dat
ai
wot
worryin
me
no
sure
it
ai
admitted
larry
the
bat
ingratiatingly
but
go
on
keep
movin
slimmy
wot
he
done
wid
de
stuff
done
wid
it
echoed
the
magpie
with
a
short
laugh
wot
do
youse
he
been
luggin
it
home
to
his
swell
joint
up
dere
on
de
avenoo
an
crammin
his
safe
full
of
larry
the
bat
sucked
in
his
breath
gee
dat
soft
he
murmured
and
then
suddenly
as
though
with
painful
inspiration
say
slimmy
say
are
youse
sure
youse
ai
been
handed
a
steer
the
magpie
grinned
wickedly
i
ai
fallin
fer
steers
he
said
shortly
dis
is
on
de
jimmie
dale
lurched
up
from
his
chair
and
leaning
over
the
lamp
chimney
drew
wheezily
on
his
cigarette
to
get
a
light
his
eyes
sought
the
tocsin
face
to
all
intents
and
purposes
she
was
entirely
absorbed
in
the
magpie
he
sat
down
again
to
gape
with
doglike
admiration
at
slimmy
joe
was
this
too
a
plant
why
had
the
magpie
come
to
them
with
this
story
of
henry
lasalle
and
then
the
next
instant
as
the
magpie
spoke
his
suspicions
were
allayed
let
get
down
to
cases
the
magpie
invited
crisply
i
did
blow
in

jimmie
dale
could
feel
the
tocsin
eyes
upon
him
questioning
searching
seeking
a
cue
a
plan
of
the
house
yes
or
no
and
a
decision
on
the
instant
sure
said
larry
the
bat
brightly
dat

dis
make
him

fer

the
magpie
produced
a
pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
laid
them
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
tocsin
dere
youse
are
he
announced
help
yerself
an
go
to
it

evidently
not
quite
certain
of

pencil
doubtfully
on

end
of
her
tongue
i
ai
never
drawed

the
magpie
encouragingly
dat
all
mag
just
mark

rooms
out
on
de
first
floor
an
de
basement
youse
can
explain
wot
youse
doin
as
youse
goes
along
i
get
the
tocsin
cackled
maliciously
in
assent
and
then
while
the
magpie
got
up
from
his
chair
and
stood
peering
over
her
shoulder
she
began
to
draw
labouriously
her
brows
knitted
the
pencil
hooked
awkwardly
between
forefinger
and
thumb
larry
the
bat
slouched
forward
over
the
table
his
chin
in
his
hands
appeared
to
watch
the
proceedings
with
mild
interest
but
his
eyes
like
a
hawk
were
following
every
line
on
the
paper
transferring
them
to
his
brain
photographing
every
detail
of
the
plan
in
his
mind
and
as
he
watched
there
seemed
something
that
was
near
to
the
acme
of
all
that
was
ironical
in
the
magpie
standing
there
his
sharp
little
black
eyes
drinking
in
greedily
the
tocsin
work
in
the
tocsin
herself
aiding
and
abetting
in
the
projected
theft
of
her
own
money
how
far
would
he
let
the
magpie
go
he
did
not
know
perhaps
who
could
tell
all
the
way
between
now
and
then
there
lay
that
package
if
it
were
at
makoff
at
spider
jack
if
he
could
find
it
get
it
the
magpie
as
a
temporary
custodian
of
the
estate
money
would
at
least
preclude
its
loss
by
flight
if
the
crime
club
took
alarm
too
quickly
larry
the
bat
eyes
under
lids
rested
musingly
on
the
magpie
face
the
magpie
would
not
get
very
far
away
with
it
on
the
other
hand
if
he
failed
at
spider
jack
if
after
all
he
was
wrong
and
the
package
had
never
been
there
or
if
they
had
forestalled
him
turned
the
trick
upon
him
already
secured
it
then
larry
the
bat
lips
working
on
his
cigarette
formed
in
a
twisted
smile
then
well
then
that
was
quite
another
matter
perhaps
he
and
the
magpie
might
not
agree
so
far
a
half
million
dollars
was
perhaps
not
much
out
of
eleven
millions
but
it
was
a
salvage
not
to
be
despised
why
did
he
say
half
a
million
well
why
not
if
the
magpie
knew
of
a
single
transaction
of
eighty
thousand
and
there
had
been
many
transactions
during
the
day
a
half
million
was
little
likely
to
prove
an
exaggeration
and
the
less
likely
in
view
of
the
fact
that
if
those
in
the
crime
club
were
preparing
for
an
emergency
they
would
not
stint
themselves
in
the
disposal
of
securities
the
magpie
was
keeping
up
a
running
fire
of
questions
as
the
tocsin
toiled
on
with
her
pencil
where
did
the
hall
lead
to
how
many
windows
in
the
library
did
she
remember
the
kind
of
fastenings
did
the
servants
sleep
in
the
basement
or
above
and
finally
twice
over
as
she
finished
the
clumsy
drawing
and
pushed
it
toward
him
he
demanded
minute
details
of
the
position
of
the
safe
aw
dat
all
right
slimmy

the
bat
cut
in
airily

grunted
sarcastically
an
where

up
dere
by

one
larry
the
bat
shook
his
head
what
time
was
it
now
it
was
about
nine
when
he
had
first
met
the
tocsin
then
the
sanctuary
then
the
long
walk
as
he
had
followed
her
say
a
quarter
of
ten
for
that
and
he
had
certainly
been
here
with
her
not
less
than
an
hour
and
a
half
it
must
be
after
eleven
then
one
and
before
that
must
come
makoff
and
spider
jack
the
night
that
half
an
hour
ago
had
seemed
so
sterile
was
crowding
a
program
of
events
upon
him
now
too
fast
nothin
doin
he
said
thoughtfully
youse
are
in
wrong
dere
slimmy
one
do
go
say
take
it
from
me
i
watched
dat
guy
too
many
nights
fer
mag
often
he
leaves
de
club
before
one
an
he
ai
never
in
bed
before
all
right
agreed
the
magpie
after
a
moment
reflection
youse
ought
to
know
make
it
three
he
pulled
a
cigar
from
his
pocket
lighted
it
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
stuck
his
feet
up
on
the
table
if
youse
do
mind
mag
i
stick
around
a
while
he
decided
calmly
mabbe
de
less
i
seen
de
better
an
i
guess
dere
wo
be
nobody
lookin
fer
me
larry
the
bat
coughed
suddenly
and
rose
up
a
little
heavily
from
his
chair
he
had
not
counted
on
that
if
the
magpie
was
settling
down
for
a
prolonged
stay
it
devolved
upon
him
jimmie
dale
to
get
away
and
at
once
and
without
exciting
the
magpie
suspicions
he
coughed
again
looked
nervously
from
the
tocsin
to
the
magpie
stammered
swallowed
hard
and
coughed
once
more
well
wot
bitin
youse
inquired
the
magpie
ironically
nothin
said
larry
the
bat
and
hesitated
nothin
only
he
hesitated
again
and
then
the
words
in
a
rush
say
slimmy
could
youse
come
across
wid
a
piece
of
dat
century
now
wot
fer
demanded
the
magpie
a
little
aggressively
larry
the
bat
cleared
his
throat
with
a
desperate
effort
youse
knows
he
admitted
sheepishly
just
gim
me
de
price
of
one
slimmy

exploded
the
magpie
an
get
soaked
to
de
eyes
not

no
honest
to

no
slimmy
just

pleaded
larry
the
bat
nix
said
the
magpie
shortly
larry
the
bat
thrust
out
a
hand
before
the
magpie
eyes
that
shook
tremulously
i
got
to
have
it
he
declared
with
sudden
fierceness

when

his
youse
cocaine

snorted
the
magpie
in
disgust
he
dug
down
into
his
pocket
produced
a
bill
and
flung
it
across
the
table
to
larry
the
bat
well
dere
youse
are
but
youse
can
take
it
from
me
larry
dat

swore
threateningly

larry
the

fervently
grabbing
at

i
be
up

before

eh
well
so
long
slimmy
he
slouched
eagerly
to
the
door
so
long
mag
he
paused
on
the
threshold
for
a
single
significant
glance
see
youse
on
de
avenoo
mag
i
be
up
dere
before
youse

said
the
tocsin
contemptuously
and
an
instant
later
jimmie
dale
closed
the
outer
door
behind
him
chapter
xii
john
johansson
nearly
midnight
already
it
was
even
later
than
he
had
thought
larry
the
bat
pressed
his
face
against
a
shop
windowpane
on
the
bowery
for
a
glance
at
a
clock
that
had
caught
his
eye
on
the
wall
within
nearly
midnight
he
slouched
on
again
hurriedly
still
debating
in
his
mind
as
he
had
been
debating
it
all
the
way
from
the
tocsin
the
question
of
returning
again
to
the
sanctuary
so
far
the
way
both
to
spider
and
the
sanctuary
had
been
in
the
same
direction
but
the
sanctuary
was
on
the
next
street
jimmie
dale
reached
the
corner
and
hesitated
it
was
strange
how
strong
was
the
intuition
upon
him
that
bade
him
go
on
and
make
all
speed
to
spider
jack
while
equally
strong
was
the
cold
stubborn
logic
that
bade
him
go
first
to
the
sanctuary
there
were
things
that
he
needed
there
that
would
probably
be
absolutely
essential
to
him
before
the
night
was
out
things
without
which
he
might
be
so
badly
handicapped
as
to
invite
failure
from
the
start
and
yet
it
was
already
midnight
ostensibly
both
makoff
and
spider
jack
closed
their
places
at
eleven
but
that
might
mean
anything
depending
upon
their
own
respective
inclinations
or
on
what
of
their
own
peculiar
brand
of
deviltry
might
be
afoot
if
they
were
still
about
still
in
evidence
he
was
still
too
early
midnight
though
it
was
though
on
the
other
hand
if
the
coast
was
clear
he
could
ill
afford
to
lose
a
moment
of
the
time
between
now
and
the
hour
that
the
magpie
had
planned
for
the
robbery
of
henry
lasalle
for
it
would
not
be
an
easy
matter
even
once
inside
spider
jack
to
find
that
package
since
it
was
spider
open
boast
that
things
committed
to
his
care
were
where
the
police
or
any
one
else
might
as
well
whistle
and
suck
their
thumbs
as
try
to
find
them
and
then
with
sudden
decision
taking
his
hesitation
as
it
were
by
the
throat
jimmie
dale
hurried
on
again
to
the
sanctuary
at
most
it
could
delay
him
but
another
fifteen
minutes
and
by
twelve
or
a
quarter
to
one
at
the
latest
he
would
be
at
spider
jack
disdaining
the
secrecy
of
the
side
door
on
the
alley
for
who
had
a
better
right
or
was
better
known
there
than
larry
the
bat
a
tenant
of
years
he
entered
the
tenement
by
the
front
door
scuffled
up
the
stairs
to
the
first
landing
and
let
himself
into
his
disreputable
room
he
locked
the
door
behind
him
lighted
the
choked
and
wheezy
gas
jet
in
a
single
glance
assured
himself
that
the
blinds
were
tightly
shut
and
kneeling
in
the
far
corner
threw
back
the
oilcloth
and
lifted
up
the
loose
section
of
the
flooring
beneath
he
reached
inside
fumbling
under
the
neatly
folded
clothes
of
jimmie
dale
and
in
a
moment
laid
his
leather
girdle
with
its
kit
of
burglar
tools
on
the
floor
beside
him
and
beside
that
again
an
electric
flashlight
a
black
silk
mask
and
what
he
had
never
expected
to
use
again
when
early
the
night
before
he
had
as
he
had
believed
put
it
away
forever
the
thin
metal
insignia
case
of
the
gray
seal
another
moment
and
with
the
flooring
replaced
the
oilcloth
rolled
back
into
position
he
had
stripped
off
his
coat
and
was
pulling
his
spotted
greasy
shirt
off
over
his
head
then
stooping
quickly
he
picked
up
the
girdle
put
it
on
put
on
his
shirt
again
over
it
put
on
his
coat
put
the
metal
case
the
flashlight
and
the
mask
in
his
pockets
and
once
more
the
sanctuary
was
in
darkness
it
was
perhaps
fifteen
minutes
later
that
jimmie
dale
turned
into
the
upper
section
of
thompson
street
here
he
slowed
his
pace
that
had
been
almost
a
run
since
he
had
left
the
sanctuary
and
began
to
shuffle
leisurely
along
for
the
street
that
a
few
hours
before
would
have
been
choked
with
its
pushcarts
and
venders
its
half
naked
children
playing
where
they
could
find
room
in
the
gutters
its
sidewalks
thronged
with
shawled
women
and
picturesquely
dressed
earringed
men
a
scene
as
it
were
transported
from
some
foreign
land
was
still
far
from
deserted
the
quiet
if
quiet
it
could
be
called
was
but
comparative
there
were
many
yet
about
and
he
had
no
desire
to
attract
attention
by
any
evidence
of
undue
haste
and
besides
spider
was
just
ahead
making
the
corner
of
the
alleyway
a
few
hundred
feet
farther
on
and
he
had
very
good
reasons
for
desiring
to
approach
spider
little
novelty
store
at
a
pace
that
would
afford
him
every
opportunity
for
observation
on
he
shuffled
along
the
street
until
reaching
spider
jack
a
little
brick
structure
a
muttered
exclamation
of
satisfaction
escaped
him
the
shop
was
closed
and
dark
and
though
spider
jack
lived
above
the
store
there
were
no
lights
even
in
the
upper
windows
spider
jack
presumably
was
either
out
or
in
bed
so
far
then
he
could
have
asked
for
nothing
more
jimmie
dale
edged
in
close
to
the
building
as
he
slouched
by
so
close
that
his
hat
brim
seemed
to
touch
the
windowpane
it
was
possible
that
from
a
room
at
the
rear
of
the
store
there
might
be
a
light
with
a
telltale
ray
perhaps
filtering
through
say
a
door
crack
but
there
was
nothing
only
blackness
within
he
paused
at
the
corner
of
the
building
by
the
alleyway
down
here
adjoining
the
high
board
fence
of
spider
jack
back
yard
makoff
made
pretense
at
pawnbrokering
in
a
small
and
dingy
wooden
building
that
was
little
more
pretentious
than
a
shed
and
in
makoff
place
so
far
as
he
could
see
there
was
no
light
either
jimmie
dale
fingers
were
industriously
rolling
a
cigarette
as
under
the
brim
of
his
slouch
hat
his
eyes
were
noting
every
detail
around
him
a
yard
in
against
the
wall
of
spider
jack
the
wall
cutting
off
the
rays
of
the
street
lamp
at
a
sharp
angle
it
was
shadowy
and
black
and
beyond
that
farther
in
the
alleyway
was
like
a
pit
it
would
take
less
far
less
than
the
fraction
of
a
second
to
gain
that
yard
but
some
one
was
approaching
behind
him
and
a
little
group
of
people
loitered
with
annoying
persistency
directly
across
the
way
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
jimmie
dale
stuck
the
cigarette
between
his
lips
fumbled
in
his
pockets
and
finally
produced
a
box
of
matches
the
group
opposite
was
moving
on
now
the
footsteps
he
had
heard
behind
him
those
of
a
man
drew
nearer
the
man
passed
by
and
the
box
of
matches
in
jimmie
dale
hand
dropped
to
the
ground
he
reached
to
pick
them
up
and
in
his
stooping
posture
without
seeming
to
turn
his
head
flung
a
quick
glance
behind
him
up
the
street
no
one
for
that
fraction
of
a
second
that
he
needed
was
near
enough
to
see
and
in
that
fraction
of
a
second
jimmie
dale
disappeared
a
dozen
yards
down
the
lane
he
sprang
for
the
top
of
the
high
fence
gripped
it
and
lithe
and
active
as
a
cat
swung
himself
up
and
over
and
dropped
noiselessly
to
the
ground
on
the
other
side
here
he
stood
motionless
for
a
moment
close
against
the
fence
to
get
his
bearings
the
rear
of
spider
jack
building
loomed
up
before
him
the
back
windows
as
unlighted
as
those
in
front
luck
so
far
at
least
was
with
him
he
turned
and
looked
about
him
and
his
eyes
growing
accustomed
to
the
darkness
he
could
just
make
out
makoff
place
bordering
the
end
of
the
yard
nor
from
this
new
vantage
point
could
he
discover
any
more
than
before
a
single
sign
of
life
about
the
establishment
jimmie
dale
stole
forward
across
the
yard
mounted
the
three
steps
of
the
low
stoop
at
spider
jack
back
door
and
tried
the
door
cautiously
it
was
locked
from
his
pocket
came
the
small
steel
instrument
that
had
stood
larry
the
bat
in
good
stead
a
hundred
times
before
in
similar
circumstances
he
inserted
it
in
the
keyhole
worked
deftly
with
it
for
an
instant
and
tried
the
door
again
it
was
still
locked
and
then
jimmie
dale
smiled
almost
apologetically
spider
jack
did
not
use
ordinary
locks
on
his
back
door
the
discountenanced
instrument
went
back
into
his
pocket
and
now
jimmie
dale
hand
slipped
inside
his
shirt
and
from
one
of
the
little
upright
pockets
of
the
leather
belt
and
from
still
another
and
from
after
that
a
third
came
the
vicious
little
tools
the
sensitive
fingers
travelled
slowly
up
and
down
the
side
of
the
door
and
then
he
was
at
work
in
earnest
a
minute
passed
another
there
was
a
dull
low
grating
sound
a
snick
as
of
metal
yielding
suddenly
and
jimmie
dale
was
coolly
stowing
away
his
tools
again
inside
his
shirt
he
pushed
the
door
open
an
inch
listened
then
swung
it
wide
stepped
inside
and
closed
it
behind
him
a
round
white
beam
of
light
flashed
in
a
quick
circle
and
went
out
it
was
a
sort
of
storeroom
innocent
enough
and
orderly
enough
in
appearance
with
boxes
and
packing
cases
piled
neatly
against
the
walls
in
one
corner
a
staircase
led
to
the
story
above
and
from
above
quite
audibly
now
he
caught
the
sound
of
snoring
spider
jack
was
in
bed
then
directly
facing
him
was
the
open
door
of
another
room
and
jimmie
dale
moving
softly
forward
entered
it
he
had
never
been
in
spider
before
and
his
first
concern
was
to
form
an
intimate
acquaintanceship
with
his
surroundings
again
the
flashlight
circled
and
again
went
out
no
windows
muttered
jimmie
dale
under
his
breath
nothing
very
fancy
about
the
architecture
three
rooms
in
a
row
store
in
front
of
this
room
through
that
door
of
course
wonder
if
the
door
locked
though
it
a
foregone
conclusion
the
package
would
be
in
not
a
sound
his
tread
silent
he
crossed
to
the
closed
door
that
he
had
noticed
it
was
unlocked
and
he
opened
it
tentatively
a
little
way
a
faint
glow
of
light
diffused
itself
through
the
opening
jimmie
dale
nodded
his
head
and
closed
the
door
again
the
street
lamp
shining
through
the
shop
windows
accounted
for
the
light
and
now
the
flashlight
played
with
steady
inquisitiveness
about
him
the
room
in
which
he
stood
seemed
to
combine
a
sort
of
office
with
a
lounging
room
in
which
spider
jack
no
doubt
entertained
his
particular
cronies
there
was
table
in
the
centre
cards
still
upon
it
chairs
about
it
against
the
wall
farthest
away
from
the
shop
stood
a
huge
cabinet
and
a
little
farther
along
anglewise
partitioning
off
the
corner
as
it
were
hung
for
some
purpose
or
other
a
cretonne
curtain
also
against
the
wall
next
to
the
lane
bringing
a
commiserating
smile
to
jimmie
dale
lips
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
it
was
a
clumsy
lumbering
antique
safe
jimmie
dale
eyes
returned
to
the
curtain
what
was
it
doing
there
what
was
it
for
instinctively
he
stepped
over
to
examine
it
a
single
glance
however
as
he
lifted
it
aside
sufficed
it
was
nothing
but
a
clothes
closet
he
turned
from
it
switched
off
the
flashlight
and
stood
staring
meditatively
into
the
darkness
in
a
strange
house
with
the
knowledge
to
begin
with
that
what
he
sought
was
carefully
hidden
it
was
no
sinecure
to
find
that
package
he
had
never
for
a
moment
imagined
that
it
would
be
but
of
one
thing
however
there
was
no
uncertainty
in
his
mind
he
would
get
the
package
by
search
if
possible
by
other
means
if
search
failed
it
was
now
close
to
one
if
by
two
his
efforts
had
been
fruitless
spider
jack
would
hand
over
the
package
at
the
revolver
point
it
was
quite
simple
meanwhile
jimmie
dale
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
going
over
to
the
safe
knelt
down
in
front
of
it
meanwhile
as
well
begin
here
as
anywhere
else
the
trained
fingers
closed
on
the
handle
and
on
the
instant
as
though
in
startled
amazement
shifted
to
the
dial
they
came
back
to
the
handle
a
wrench
then
a
low
amused
chuckle
and
the
door
swung
open
the
great
unwieldy
thing
was
only
a
monumental
bluff
it
not
only
had
not
been
locked
but
it
could
not
be
locked
the
mechanism
was
out
of
order
the
bolts
could
not
be
moved
by
so
much
as
a
hair
breadth
still
chuckling
jimmie
dale
shot
the
flashlight
ray
into
the
interior
of
the
safe
and
the
chuckle
died
on
his
lips
and
into
his
face
came
a
look
of
strained
bewilderment
inside
everything
was
in
chaos
books
papers
a
miscellany
of
articles
as
though
they
had
first
been
ruthlessly
pulled
out
on
the
floor
then
gathered
up
in
an
armful
and
crammed
back
inside
again
for
an
instant
he
did
not
move
and
then
a
queer
hard
mirthless
smile
drew
down
the
corners
of
his
mouth
with
a
sort
of
bitter
expectant
nod
of
his
head
he
turned
the
light
upon
the
door
of
the
safe
yes
there
were
the
scratches
that
the
tools
had
left
and
as
though
in
sardonic
jest
the
holes
where
the
steel
bit
had
bored
were
plugged
with
putty
and
rubbed
over
with
some
black
substance
that
was
still
wet
and
came
off
smearing
his
finger
as
he
touched
it
it
could
not
have
been
done
long
ago
then
how
long
a
half
hour
an
hour
not
more
than
that
mechanically
he
closed
the
door
of
the
safe
rose
to
his
feet
and
almost
heedless
of
noise
now
the
flashlight
ray
dancing
before
him
he
jumped
across
to
the
cabinet
and
pulled
the
door
open
here
as
within
the
safe
all
inside
plain
evidence
of
thorough
if
hasty
search
was
scattered
and
tossed
about
in
hopeless
confusion
he
shut
the
cabinet
door
the
flashlight
went
out
and
he
stood
like
a
man
stunned
the
sense
of
some
abysmal
disaster
upon
him
he
was
too
late
the
game
was
up
if
it
had
ever
been
here
the
package
was
gone
now
gone
the
crime
club
had
been
here
before
him
the
game
was
up
the
game
was
up
his
mind
seemed
to
keep
on
repeating
that
the
crime
club
had
beaten
him
by
an
hour
at
most
and
had
been
here
and
had
searched
it
was
strange
though
that
they
should
have
been
at
such
curious
pains
to
cover
their
tracks
by
leaving
the
room
in
order
by
such
paltry
efforts
to
make
the
safe
appear
untouched
when
the
first
glance
that
was
at
all
critical
would
disclose
immediately
what
had
been
done
why
should
they
need
to
cover
their
tracks
at
all
or
if
it
was
necessary
why
above
all
in
such
a
pitifully
inadequate
way
his
mind
barked
back
to
the
same
ghastly
refrain
the
game
was
up
no
not
yet
there
was
still
a
chance
there
was
still
spider
jack
suppose
in
spite
of
their
search
they
had
failed
to
find
the
package
jimmie
dale
lips
set
in
a
thin
line
as
he
started
abruptly
toward
the
door
there
was
still
that
chance
and
one
thing
was
grimly
certain
spider
jack
would
at
least
show
him
where
the
package
had
been
and
then
halfway
to
the
door
he
halted
suddenly
and
stood
still
listening
an
electric
bell
was
ringing
loudly
imperiously
somewhere
upstairs
followed
almost
immediately
the
sound
of
some
one
spider
jack
presumably
moving
hurriedly
about
overhead
and
then
a
moment
later
steps
coming
down
the
staircase
in
the
adjoining
room
jimmie
dale
drew
back
flattening
himself
against
the
wall
spider
jack
entered
the
room
stumbled
across
it
in
the
darkness
fumbled
for
the
door
that
led
into
his
little
shop
opened
it
passed
through
fumbled
around
in
there
again
for
matches
evidently
then
lighted
a
gas
jet
in
the
store
and
going
to
the
street
door
opened
it
jimmie
dale
had
edged
along
the
wall
a
little
to
a
position
where
he
had
an
unobstructed
view
through
the
open
doorway
connecting
the
shop
and
the
room
in
which
he
stood
spider
jack
in
trousers
and
shirt
hastily
donned
no
doubt
as
he
had
got
out
of
bed
was
standing
in
the
street
doorway
and
beyond
him
loomed
the
forms
of
several
men
spider
jack
stepped
aside
to
allow
his
visitors
to
enter
and
suddenly
a
cry
barely
suppressed
upon
his
lips
jimmie
dale
involuntarily
strained
forward
three
men
had
entered
but
his
eyes
were
fixed
fascinated
upon
only
one
the
first
of
the
three
was
it
an
hallucination
was
he
mad
it
was
hilton
travers
the
chauffeur
the
man
whom
he
could
have
sworn
he
had
last
seen

in
that
chair
in
that
ghastly
death
chamber
of
the
crime
club
rather
rough
on
you
spider
to
pull

of

at
this
hour
the
chauffeur
was
saying
apologetically

gruffly
amiable

five
minutes
or
jimmie
dale
brain
was
whirling
what
did
it
mean
he
could
not
seem
to
understand
his
mind
seemed
to
refuse
its
functions
travers
the
chauffeur
alive
he
drew
in
his
breath
sharply
that
curtain
in
the
corner
he
must
see
this
out
now
they
were
coming
quick
noiseless
he
stole
along
the
side
of
the
wall
reached
the
corner
and
slipped
in
behind
the
curtain
as
spider
jack
striking
a
match
entered
the
room
spider
jack
lighted
the
gas
and
as
the
others
followed
behind
him
waved
them
toward
the
chairs
around
the
table
i
just
ask
you
gents
not
to
leave
the
room
he
said
meaningly
over
his
shoulder
as
he
stepped
toward
the
rear
door
it
kind
of
a
fad
of
mine
to
keep
some
things
even
from
my
wife
all
right
spider
i
understand
the
chauffeur
returned
readily
jimmie
dale
knife
cut
a
tiny
slit
in
the
cretonne
on
a
level
with
his
eyes
the
three
men
had
seated
themselves
at
the
table
and
appeared
to
be
listening
intently
spider
jack
footsteps
echoed
back
as
he
crossed
the
rear
room
sounded
dull
and
muffled
descending
the
stoop
outside
and
died
away
i
told
you
it
was
in
the
house
the
man
who
had
been
introduced
as
stead
laughed
shortly
we
wasted
the
hour
we
had
the
third
man
spoke
crisply
incisively
to
the
chauffeur
turn
down
that
gas
jet
a
little
you
got
across
with
it
so
far
but
you
ca
stand
a
searchlight
clarke
and
at
the
words
in
a
flash
the
meaning
of
it
all
of
it
to
the
last
detail
that
was
spelling
death
ruin
and
disaster
for
her
the
tocsin
for
himself
as
well
burst
upon
jimmie
dale
that
voice
he
would
have
known
it
recognised
it
among
a
thousand
it
was
the
masked
man
of
the
night
before
the
leader
the
head
of
the
crime
club
and
it
was
not
travers
there
at
all
he
remembered
now
too
well
that
second
room
they
had
showed
him
in
the
crime
club
its
multitude
of
disguises
though
in
this
case
they
had
the
dead
man
clothes
ready
to
their
hands
the
leader
boast
that
impersonation
was
but
child
play
to
them
and
now
he
understood
why
they
had
covered
up
the
traces
of
their
search
in
only
so
curiously
inadequate
a
manner
they
had
failed
to
find
the
package
and
as
a
last
resort
had
adopted
the
ruse
of
impersonating
hilton
travers
the
chauffeur
which
made
it
necessary
that
when
they
called
spider
jack
from
his
bed
as
they
had
just
done
that
spider
jack
at
a
casual
glance
should
notice
nothing
amiss
but
it
would
be
no
more
than
a
casual
glance
for
who
should
know
better
than
they
he
would
not
have
to
go
for
the
package
to
any
place
that
they
had
disturbed
and
he
jimmie
dale
could
only
stand
here
and
watch
them
helpless
powerless
to
move
three
of
them
a
step
out
into
the
room
was
to
invite
certain
death
it
would
not
matter
his
death
if
he
could
gain
anything
for
her
for
the
tocsin
by
it
but
what
could
he
gain
by
dying
he
clenched
his
hands
until
the
nails
bit
into
the
flesh
spider
jack
the
room
carrying
what
looked
like
a
large
bulky
manila
envelope
heavily
sealed
in
his
hand
he
tossed
it
on
the
table
there
you
are
travers
he
said
i
wonder
suggested
the
leader
pleasantly
if
now
that
we
here
travers
your
friend
would
mind
letting
us
have
this
room
for
a
few
minutes
to
ourselves
to
clean
up
the
business
sure
agreed
spider
jack
cordially
you
welcome
to
it
i
wait
out
here
in
the
store
until
you
say
the
he
went
out
closing
the
door
after
him
the
leader
picked
up
the
package
we
take
no
chances
with
this
he
said
grimly
it
been
too
close
a
call
after
we
had
a
look
at
it
we
put
it
out
of
harm
way
on
the
spot
here
while
we
got
it
before
we
leave
he
ripped
the
package
open
and
disclosed
perhaps
a
dozen
documents
besides
a
miscellaneous
number
of
others
he
took
up
the
first
of
the
papers
glanced
through
it
hurriedly
then
tossed
it
to
the
pseudo
chauffeur
tear
it
up
and
tear
it
up
small
he
ordered
tersely
the
next
after
examining
it
as
he
had
the
first
he
tossed
to
the
other
man
go
ahead
curtly
work
fast
from
the
looks
of
these
travers
had
us
cold
there
proof
enough
here
of
lasalle
murder
to
send
us
all
to
the
chair
he
went
on
glancing
through
the
documents
and
then
suddenly
joining
the
others
in
their
work
began
to
rip
and
tear
at
the
papers
himself
a
sort
of
cold
horror
had
settled
upon
jimmie
dale
and
his
forehead
was
clammy
wet
the
inhuman
irony
of
it
that
he
should
stand
there
and
watch
impotent
to
prevent
it
the
destruction
of
what
he
would
have
given
his
life
to
secure
and
then
slowly
a
grim
hard
merciless
smile
came
to
his
lips
he
had
recognised
the
leader
voice
now
he
would
recognise
the
leader
face
at
least
that
was
left
to
him
perhaps
the
master
trump
of
all
it
would
not
be
very
hard
to
find
the
crime
club
now
with
that
man
to
lead
the
way
the
scraps
of
paper
tiny
shreds
mounted
into
a
heap
on
the
table
and
with
the
last
of
the
contents
of
the
package
destroyed
the
leader
stood
up
put
these
pieces
in
your
pockets
we
do
want
to
leave
them
here
he
directed
quietly
and
then
let
get
in
scarcely
a
moment
the
last
scrap
of
paper
had
vanished
the
three
men
walked
to
the
door
passed
through
it
and
joined
spider
jack
in
the
store
and
jimmie
dale
slipping
out
from
behind
the
curtain
gained
the
door
of
the
rear
room
crept
through
it
reached
the
stoop
and
then
darting
like
the
wind
across
the
yard
was
over
the
fence
in
a
second
and
in
another
was
out
of
the
alleyway
and
on
the
street
he
was
in
time
in
plenty
of
time
they
had
just
left
spider
jack
and
were
perhaps
fifty
yards
or
so
ahead
of
him
he
slouched
on
behind
them
the
cold
grim
smile
on
his
lips
once
more
it
was
the
crime
club
now
that
hell
cradle
where
their
devil
schemes
were
hatched
that
was
the
one
thing
left
to
him
they
would
lead
him
to
that
and
then
and
then
it
would
be
his
turn
to
strike
they
turned
the
first
corner
and
suddenly
as
the
racing
engine
of
an
automobile
caught
his
ear
he
broke
into
a
run
and
dashed
around
the
corner
after
them
in
time
to
see
them
jump
into
a
car
and
the
car
speed
off
along
the
street
he
halted
as
though
he
were
suddenly
dazed
started
involuntarily
to
run
forward
again
stopped
with
a
hollow
laugh
at
the
futility
of
it
and
stood
still
and
motionless
on
the
sidewalk
and
then
he
swayed
a
little
and
his
face
grew
gray
failure
defeat
ruin
in
that
moment
he
knew
them
all
to
their
bitterest
dregs
how
could
he
go
to
her
how
could
he
face
her
and
tell
her
that
they
were
beaten
that
the
last
hope
was
gone
that
he
had
failed
god
he
cried
aloud
and
clenched
his
hands
then
deep
in
his
consciousness
a
thought
stirred
and
he
swept
a
shaking
hand
across
his
eyes
why
had
it
come
again
that
thought
did
it
mean
that
he
must
play
the
last
card
there
was
a
way
there
had
always
been
a
way
the
way
the
crime
club
took
murder
it
was
their
own
weapon
if
the
man
who
posed
as
henry
lasalle
were
killed
if
that
man
were
killed
the
magpie
was
to
be
there
at
three
he
muttered
and
started
mechanically
back
along
the
street
chapter
xiii
the
only
way
it
was
a
horrible
thing
and
it
grew
upon
him
in
a
blind
mechanical
way
his
brain
receptive
to
nothing
else
jimmie
dale
walked
on
along
the
street
to
kill
a
man
death
he
had
faced
himself
a
hundred
times
witnessed
it
a
hundred
times
in
its
most
violent
forms
had
seen
murder
done
before
his
eyes
had
been
in
straits
where
to
save
his
own
life
it
had
seemed
the
one
last
desperate
chance
and
yet
his
hands
were
still
clean
to
kill
a
man
in
fair
fight
in
struggle
when
the
blood
was
hot
was
terrible
enough
a
possibility
that
was
always
before
him
the
one
thing
from
which
he
shrank
the
one
thing
that
as
the
gray
seal
he
had
always
feared
but
to
kill
a
man
deliberately
to
creep
upon
his
victim
with
hideous
premeditation
he
shivered
a
little
and
his
hand
shook
as
he
drew
it
nervously
across
his
eyes
but
there
was
no
other
way
again
and
again
insidiously
grappling
with
his
revulsion
with
the
horror
that
the
impulse
to
murder
inspired
came
that
other
thought
there
was
no
other
way
if
the
man
who
posed
as
henry
lasalle
were
dead
if
he
were
dead
if
he
were
dead
see
now
what
would
happen
if
that
man
were
dead
how
clear
his
brain
was
on
that
point
the
whole
plot
would
tumble
like
a
house
of
cards
about
the
heads
of
the
crime
club
the
courts
would
require
an
auditing
of
the
estate
by
a
trustee
of
the
courts
own
appointing
who
would
continue
to
administer
it
until
the
tocsin
birthday
or
until
there
was
tangible
evidence
of
her
death
but
the
tocsin
automatically
with
her
pseudo
uncle
death
could
publicly
appear
again
her
death
could
no
longer
benefit
the
crime
club
since
it
the
crime
club
with
the
supposed
uncle
dead
could
not
profit
through
the
false
henry
lasalle
inheriting
as
next
of
kin
it
was
the
weak
link
the
vulnerable
point
in
the
stupendous
scheme
of
murder
and
crime
with
which
these
hell
fiends
had
played
for
and
won
so
far
the
stake
of
eleven
millions
not
that
they
had
overlooked
or
been
blind
to
this
they
were
too
clever
too
cunning
for
that
it
was
only
that
they
had
planned
to
accomplish
the
tocsin
death
as
they
had
her
father
and
uncle
and
establish
the
false
henry
lasalle
in
undisputed
possession
and
ownership
of
the
estate
and
had
failed
in
that
up
to
the
present
but
the
material
results
remained
the
same
so
long
as
the
tocsin
to
save
her
life
was
forced
to
remain
in
hiding
so
long
as
proof
that
would
convict
the
crime
club
was
not
forthcoming
so
long
as
that
man
lived
time
passed
to
which
jimmie
dale
was
oblivious
at
times
he
walked
slowly
scarcely
moving
at
times
his
pace
was
a
nervous
hurried
stride
that
was
almost
a
run
and
as
he
was
oblivious
to
time
so
was
he
oblivious
to
his
surroundings
to
the
direction
which
he
took
at
times
his
forehead
was
damp
with
moisture
that
was
not
there
from
physical
exertion
at
times
his
face
deathly
white
was
full
as
of
the
vision
of
some
shuddering
abhorrent
sight
at
times
his
lips
were
thinned
into
a
straight
line
and
there
was
a
glitter
in
the
dark
eyes
that
was
not
good
to
see
while
his
hands
at
his
sides
clenched
until
the
skin
tight
over
the
knuckles
was
an
ivory
white
to
kill
a
man
what
other
way
was
there
the
proof
that
it
had
taken
hilton
travers
years
to
obtain
the
proof
on
which
the
tocsin
life
depended
was
destroyed
utterly
irreparably
it
could
never
be
duplicated
hilton
travers
was
dead
murdered
murder
that
thought
again
it
was
their
own
weapon
murder
would
one
kill
a
venomous
reptile
in
whose
fangs
was
death
what
right
had
this
man
to
life
whose
life
was
forfeit
even
under
the
law
for
murder
was
she
to
drag
on
an
intolerable
existence
among
the
dregs
and
the
scum
of
the
underworld
she
in
her
refinement
and
her
purity
to
exist
among
the
vile
and
dissolute
in
daily
hourly
peril
of
her
life
because
the
weapons
that
these
inhuman
vultures
had
used
to
rob
her
to
destroy
those
she
loved
to
make
of
her
life
a
hideous
joyless
thing
should
not
be
used
against
them
but
to
kill
a
man
to
steal
upon
a
man
with
cold
intent
in
the
blackness
of
the
night
and
take
his
life
to
be
a
murderer
to
know
the
horror
of
blood
forever
upon
one
hands
to
rise
in
the
night
fearful
of
the
very
shadows
around
one
to
live
with
every
detail
of
that
fearsome
act
sweeping
like
some
dread
spectre
at
unexpected
moments
upon
the
consciousness
he
put
up
his
hands
before
his
face
as
though
to
blot
out
the
thought
from
him
mind
and
soul
recoiled
before
it
to
kill
a
man
he
walked
on
and
on
until
at
last
conscious
of
a
sense
of
fatigue
he
stopped
he
must
have
come
a
long
way
been
walking
a
long
time
where
was
he
he
looked
about
him
for
a
moment
in
a
dazed
way
and
suddenly
with
a
low
cry
shrank
back
as
though
he
had
been
drawn
to
it
by
some
ghastly
magnet
he
found
himself
standing
in
front
of
the
lasalle
mansion
on
fifth
avenue
no
no
it
was
not
for
that
he
had
come
to
kill
a
man
it
was
only
only
to
get
that
money
yes
he
remembered
now
that
money
from
the
safe
before
the
magpie
got
it
the
magpie
was
to
be
there
at
three
and
the
tocsin
was
to
be
there
too
the
tocsin
that
package
he
had
failed
it
had
been
her
one
hope
and
and
it
was
gone
what
could
he
say
to
her
how
could
he
tell
her
the
miserable
truth
but
but
he
had
not
come
there
in
the
dead
of
night
to
kill
a
man
these
other
things
were
what
had
jimmie
it
was
a
whisper
a
hand
was
on
his
arm
he
turned
startled
it
was
the
tocsin
silver
mag
jimmie
in
alarm
why
are
you
standing
here
like
this
you
may
be
seen
seen
suppose
he
were
seen
he
shuddered
a
little
yes
that
so
he
said
hoarsely
he
glanced
numbly
up
and
down
the
wide
deserted
but
avenue
it
was
no
place
that
most
aristocratic
section
of
the
city
for
such
as
silver
mag
and
larry
the
bat
to
be
seen
at
that
hour
of
night
or
rather
morning
and
if
anything
happened
inside
that
house
i
i
did
think
of
that
he
said
mechanically
come
across
the
street
under
the
stoop
of
that
house
she
had
his
arm
and
was
half
dragging
him
as
she
spoke
the
alarm
in
her
voice
intensified
and
then
a
moment
later
safe
from
observation
jimmie
jimmie
what
is
the
matter
what
has
happened
what
makes
you
act
so
strangely
nothing
he
said
i
tell
me
she
insisted
wildly
and
then
with
a
violent
effort
jimmie
dale
forced
his
mind
back
to
the
immediate
present
he
was
only
inspiring
her
with
terror
and
there
was
the
magpie
and
that
money
in
the
safe
where
is
the
magpie
he
asked
with
quick
apprehension
am
i
late
is
he
in
there
already
no
she
said
he
has
come
what
time
is
it
he
demanded
anxiously
about
two
she
replied
but
jimmie
wait
he
broke
in
where
is
he
now
you
were
both
together
and
you
were
both
to
be
here
at
three
what
are
you
doing
here
alone
at
two
a
strange
little
exclamation
one
almost
of
dismay
it
seemed
escaped
her
the
magpie
left
my
place
an
hour
ago
to
get
his
kit
i
think
and
i
came
here
at
once
because
that
was
what
you
and
i
understood
i
was
to
do
was
it
jimmie
you
frighten
me
you
are
not
yourself
you
remember
the
last
words
you
said
as
you
nodded
to
me
behind
the
magpie
back
that
you
would
be
here
before
us
there
was
no
mistaking
your
meaning
if
i
could
get
away
from
him
i
was
to
come
here
and
meet
jimmie
dale
passed
his
hand
nervously
across
his
eyes
of
course
he
remembered
now
what
a
frightful
turmoil
his
brain
had
been
in
yes
of
course
he
tried
to
speak
nonchalantly
i
had
forgotten
for
the
she
caught
his
arm
in
a
quick
tight
hold
shaking
him
in
a
terrified
way
you
forget
a
thing
like
that
jimmie
something
terrible
has
happened
ca
you
see
that
i
am
nearly
mad
with
anxiety
what
is
it
what
is
it
that
package
jimmie
is
it
the
package
he
did
not
answer
what
could
he
say
it
meant
life
hope
joy
everything
that
the
world
held
for
her
and
it
was
gone
yes
it
is
the
package
she
whispered
frantically
quick
jimmie
tell
me
it
it
was
not
there
you
you
could
not
find
it
it
was
there
he
said
as
though
the
words
were
literally
forced
from
him
then
then
what
jimmie
the
clutch
on
his
arm
was
like
a
vise
they
got
it
he
said
it
was
like
a
death
sentence
that
he
pronounced
it
is
she
did
not
speak
or
move
save
that
her
hands
as
though
nerveless
and
without
strength
fell
away
from
his
arms
and
dropped
to
her
sides
it
was
dark
there
under
the
stoop
though
not
so
dark
but
that
he
could
see
her
face
it
was
gray
gray
as
death
and
there
was
misery
and
fear
and
a
pitiful
helplessness
in
it
and
then
she
swayed
a
little
and
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
gone
she
murmured
in
a
dead
colourless
way
and
suddenly
laughed
out
sharply
hysterically
do
for
god
sake
do
do
that
he
pleaded
wildly
she
looked
at
him
then
for
a
moment
in
strange
quiet
and
lifted
her
hand
and
stroked
his
face
in
a
numbed
way
it
it
would
have
been
better
jimmie
would
it
she
said
in
the
same
monotonous
voice
it
would
have
been
better
if
if
i
had
never
found
out
anything
and
they
they
had
done
the
same
to
me
that
they
did
to
to
marie
marie
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
spoken
her
name
and
it
was
on
his
lips
now
in
an
agony
of
tenderness
and
appeal
do
you
must
speak
like
that
i
tired
she
said
i
i
ca
fight
any
she
did
not
cry
she
lay
there
in
his
arms
quite
still
like
a
weary
child
the
minutes
passed
when
jimmie
dale
spoke
again
it
was
irrelevantly
and
his
face
was
very
white
marie
describe
the
upper
floor
of
that
house
over
there
for
she
roused
herself
with
a
start
the
upper
floor
she
repeated
slowly
why
why
do
you
ask
that
have
you
forgotten
in
turn
he
said
with
a
steady
smile
that
money
in
the
safe
it
yours
we
can
at
least
save
that
out
of
the
wreck
you
only
drew
the
basement
plan
and
the
first
floor
for
the
magpie
the
more
i
know
about
the
house
the
better
of
course
in
case
anything
goes
wrong
now
see
try
and
be
brave
and
tell
me
quickly
for
i
must
get
through
before
the
magpie
comes
and
i
have
barely
half
an
no
jimmie
no
she
slipped
out
of
his
arms
let
it
alone
i
am
afraid
something
i
i
have
a
feeling
that
something
will
it
is
the
only
he
said
it
involuntarily
more
to
himself
than
to
her
jimmie
let
it
alone
she
said
again
no
he
said
i
am
going
so
tell
me
quickly
every
minute
that
we
wait
is
one
that
counts
against
she
hesitated
an
instant
and
then
speaking
rapidly
made
a
verbal
sketch
of
the
upper
portion
of
the
house
for
him
it
a
very
large
house
is
it
he
commented
innocently
to
pave
the
way
for
the
question
above
all
others
that
he
had
to
ask
which
is
your
uncle
i
mean
that
man
room
the
first
on
the
right
at
the
head
of
the
landing
she
answered
only
jimmie
do
do
go
he
drew
her
close
to
him
again
now
listen
he
said
quietly
when
the
magpie
comes
and
finds
i
am
not
here
lead
him
to
think
that
the
money
he
gave
me
was
too
much
for
me
that
i
am
probably
in
some
den
doped
with
drug
and
hold
him
as
long
as
you
can
on
the
pretext
that
there
is
always
the
possibility
i
may
after
all
show
up
before
he
goes
in
there
you
understand
and
now
about
yourself
you
must
do
exactly
as
i
say
on
no
account
allow
yourself
to
be
seen
by
any
one
except
the
magpie
i
would
tell
you
to
go
now
only
unless
it
is
vitally
necessary
we
can
not
afford
to
arouse
the
magpie
suspicions
he
have
every
crook
in
the
underworld
snarling
at
our
heels
but
you
are
not
to
wait
even
for
him
if
you
detect
the
slightest
disturbance
in
that
house
before
he
comes
and
equally
after
he
has
gone
in
whether
i
have
come
out
or
not
at
the
first
indication
of
anything
unusual
you
are
to
get
away
at
once
you
understand
marie
yes
she
said
but
but
jimmie
you
just
one
thing
he
smiled
at
her
reassuringly
did
the
magpie
say
anything
about
how
he
intended
to
get
in
yes
by
the
side
away
from
the
corner
of
the
street
she
said
tremulously
you
see
there
quite
a
space
between
the
house
and
the
one
next
door
and
besides
the
house
next
door
is
closed
up
nobody
there
the
family
has
gone
away
for
the
summer
the
library
window
there
is
low
enough
to
reach
from
the
for
a
moment
longer
he
held
her
close
to
him
as
though
he
could
not
let
her
go
then
bent
and
kissed
her
passionately
and
in
that
moment
all
the
emotions
he
had
known
as
he
had
walked
blindly
from
spider
that
night
surged
again
upon
him
and
that
voice
was
whispering
whispering
whispering
it
is
the
only
way
it
is
the
only
and
then
not
daring
to
trust
his
voice
he
released
her
suddenly
and
stepped
back
out
from
under
the
stoop
and
the
next
instant
he
was
across
the
deserted
avenue
another
and
he
had
slipped
through
the
iron
gates
that
opened
on
the
street
driveway
and
in
yet
another
he
was
crouched
close
up
against
the
front
door
of
the
lasalle
mansion
it
was
a
large
house
a
very
large
house
one
of
the
few
that
even
amid
the
wealth
and
luxury
of
that
quarter
boasted
its
own
grounds
and
those
so
restricted
as
scarcely
to
deserve
the
name
but
it
was
set
far
enough
back
from
the
street
to
escape
the
radius
of
the
street
lamps
and
so
guarantee
in
its
shadows
security
from
observation
it
was
not
the
magpie
way
the
front
door
the
obvious
to
the
magpie
and
his
ilk
was
a
thing
always
to
be
shunned
jimmie
dale
lips
were
set
in
a
grim
smile
as
his
fingers
worked
with
lightning
speed
now
taking
this
instrument
and
now
that
from
the
leather
pockets
in
the
girdle
beneath
his
shirt
the
penitentiaries
were
full
of
magpies
who
shunned
the
obvious
very
slowly
very
cautiously
the
door
opened
he
listened
breathlessly
tensely
the
door
closed
again
behind
him
he
was
inside
now
stillness
blackness
not
a
sound
a
minute
went
by
another
and
then
as
he
stood
there
strained
listening
the
silence
itself
began
it
seemed
to
palpitate
and
pound
pound
pound
and
be
full
of
strange
noises
it
was
a
horrible
thing
to
kill
a
man
chapter
xiv
out
of
the
darkness
a
moment
later
jimmie
dale
stepped
forward
through
the
vestibule
he
was
quite
calm
now
a
sort
of
cold
merciless
precision
in
every
movement
succeeding
the
riot
of
turbulent
emotions
that
had
possessed
him
as
he
had
entered
the
house
the
half
hour
the
maximum
length
of
time
before
the
magpie
would
appear
as
he
had
estimated
it
when
out
there
under
the
stoop
with
the
tocsin
had
dwindled
now
to
perhaps
twenty
minutes
at
the
outside
minutes
minutes
was
so
little
that
for
an
instant
the
temptation
was
strong
upon
him
to
sacrifice
rather
than
any
of
those
precious
minutes
the
magpie
instead
and
then
in
the
darkness
as
he
stole
noiselessly
across
the
hall
he
shook
his
head
it
would
be
a
cowardly
brutal
thing
to
do
what
chance
would
a
man
with
a
record
like
the
magpie
stand
if
caught
there
how
easy
it
would
be
to
shift
the
murder
of
the
supposed
henry
lasalle
to
the
shoulders
jimmie
dale
lips
closed
firmly
was
perhaps
the
first
law
but
he
would
save
the
magpie
if
he
could
the
magpie
should
have
his
chance
the
man
might
be
a
criminal
might
deserve
punishment
at
the
hands
of
the
law
his
liberty
might
be
a
menace
to
the
community
but
he
was
not
a
murderer
his
life
forfeit
for
a
crime
he
had
never
committed
if
he
jimmie
dale
could
only
in
some
way
have
arranged
with
the
tocsin
out
there
to
keep
the
magpie
away
altogether
but
it
could
not
be
done
without
arousing
the
magpie
suspicions
and
as
a
corollary
to
that
afterward
with
the
subsequent
events
would
come
the
deluge
the
law
of
the
underworld
was
clear
concise
and
admitting
of
no
appeal
on
that
point
to
double
cross
a
pal
meant
sooner
or
later
a
knife
thrust
a
blackjack
or
but
what
difference
did
it
make
what
form
the
execution
of
the
sentence
took
and
since
then
that
was
out
of
the
question
since
he
could
not
keep
the
magpie
away
without
practically
risking
his
own
life
the
magpie
at
least
must
have
his
chance
jimmie
dale
was
at
the
library
door
now
that
according
to
the
plan
the
tocsin
had
drawn
for
the
magpie
and
as
he
remembered
her
description
when
she
had
told
him
her
story
earlier
in
the
evening
was
just
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
how
dark
it
was
though
the
stairs
could
be
only
a
few
feet
away
he
could
not
see
them
and
how
intense
the
silence
was
again
here
where
he
stood
the
slightest
stir
from
above
must
have
reached
him
but
there
was
not
a
sound
his
hand
felt
out
for
the
doorknob
found
it
turned
it
and
pushed
the
door
open
he
stepped
inside
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
the
safe
according
to
the
tocsin
plan
again
was
in
that
sort
of
alcove
at
the
lower
end
of
the
library
jimmie
dale
flashlight
played
inquisitively
about
the
room
there
was
the
window
the
only
one
in
the
room
the
window
through
which
the
magpie
proposed
to
enter
there
was
the
archway
of
the
alcove
with
its
no
there
were
no
longer
any
portieres
and
there
was
the
safe
he
could
see
it
quite
plainly
from
where
he
stood
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
the
flashlight
went
out
for
the
space
of
perhaps
thirty
seconds
thirty
seconds
of
absolute
silence
absolute
stillness
then
the
round
white
ray
of
the
light
again
but
glistening
now
on
the
nickel
knobs
and
dial
of
the
safe
and
jimmie
dale
was
on
his
knees
before
it
a
low
scarcely
breathed
exclamation
that
seemed
to
mingle
anxiety
and
hesitation
escaped
him
he
who
knew
the
make
of
every
safe
in
the
country
knew
this
one
for
its
true
worth
minutes
could
he
open
it
in
that
time
let
alone
with
any
time
to
spare
it
was
not
like
the
one
in
spider
jack
it
was
the
kind
that
the
magpie
however
clever
he
might
be
in
his
own
way
would
be
forced
to
negotiate
with
soup
and
with
the
attendant
noise
double
his
chance
of
discovery
and
capture
and
the
responsibility
for
what
might
have
happened
upstairs
no
the
magpie
must
have
his
chance
and
besides
the
money
in
the
safe
apart
why
should
not
he
jimmie
dale
have
his
own
chance
as
well
all
this
would
help
the
motive
robbery
the
perpetrator
there
was
grim
mockery
on
his
lips
now
as
the
light
went
out
and
the
sensitive
fingers
closed
on
the
knob
of
the
dial
the
perpetrator
the
gray
seal
it
would
afford
excellent
food
for
the
violent
editorial
diatribes
under
which
the
police
again
would
writhe
in
frenzy
stillness
again
silence
only
a
low
tense
breathing
only
so
faint
that
it
could
not
be
heard
a
foot
away
a
curious
scratching
as
from
time
to
time
the
supersensitive
fingers
fell
away
from
the
dial
to
rub
upon
the
carpet
to
increase
even
their
sensitiveness
by
setting
the
nerves
to
throbbing
through
the
skin
surface
at
the
tips
and
then
jimmie
dale
head
ear
pressed
close
against
the
safe
to
catch
the
tumbler
fall
was
lifted
and
the
flashlight
played
again
on
the
dial
and
a
quarter
how
fast
the
time
went
and
how
slowly
still
the
black
shape
crouched
there
in
the
darkness
against
the
safe
at
times
in
strange
ghostly
flashes
the
nickel
dial
with
the
ray
upon
it
seemed
to
leap
out
and
glisten
through
the
surrounding
blackness
at
times
the
quick
intake
of
breath
as
from
great
exertion
at
times
faint
musical
little
clicks
as
after
abortive
effort
the
dial
whirled
preparatory
to
a
fresh
attempt
and
then
at
last
a
gasp
of
relief
ah
came
the
sound
barely
audible
as
of
steel
sliding
in
grooves
the
muffled
thud
of
metal
meeting
metal
as
the
bolts
shot
back
and
the
heavy
door
swung
outward
jimmie
dale
stretched
his
cramped
limbs
and
wiped
the
moisture
from
his
face
then
set
to
work
again
upon
the
inner
door
this
was
an
easier
matter
far
easier
five
minutes
perhaps
a
little
more
went
by
and
then
the
inner
door
was
open
and
the
flashlight
ray
was
flooding
the
interior
of
the
safe
a
queer
little
sound
half
of
astonishment
half
of
disappointment
issued
from
jimmie
dale
lips
there
was
money
here
a
great
deal
of
money
undoubtedly
but
there
was
no
such
sum
as
he
had
somehow
fantastically
imagined
from
the
magpie
evidently
overcoloured
story
that
there
would
be
there
was
money
ten
packages
of
banknotes
neatly
piled
in
the
bottom
compartment
but
there
was
no
half
million
of
dollars
he
picked
up
one
of
the
packages
hurriedly
and
drew
in
his
breath
after
all
there
was
a
great
deal
the
notes
were
of
denomination
and
on
the
bottom
were
two
bills
calculated
roughly
if
each
of
the
other
nine
packages
contained
a
like
amount
the
total
must
exceed
a
hundred
thousand
and
now
jimmie
dale
began
to
work
with
feverish
haste
from
the
leather
girdle
inside
his
shirt
came
the
thin
metal
insignia
case
and
a
gray
seal
was
stuck
firmly
on
the
dial
knob
of
the
safe
this
done
he
tucked
away
the
packages
of
banknotes
some
into
his
pockets
and
some
inside
his
shirt
and
then
quickly
ransacked
the
interior
of
the
safe
flauntingly
spilling
the
contents
of
drawers
and
pigeonholes
out
upon
the
floor
he
stood
up
and
leaving
the
safe
door
wide
open
walked
back
across
the
room
to
the
window
unfastened
the
catch
and
opened
the
window
an
inch
or
two
the
way
was
open
now
for
the
magpie
the
magpie
would
have
no
need
to
make
any
noise
in
forcing
an
entrance
he
would
be
able
to
see
almost
at
a
glance
that
he
had
been
forestalled
by
the
gray
seal
and
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
game
was
up
the
magpie
had
his
chance
if
the
magpie
did
not
take
the
hint
and
make
his
escape
as
noiselessly
as
he
had
entered
it
was
his
own
fault
he
jimmie
dale
had
given
the
magpie
his
chance
jimmie
dale
turned
from
the
window
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
library
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
leaving
the
library
door
open
behind
him
how
long
had
he
been
was
it
more
or
less
than
the
minutes
he
did
not
know
only
as
yet
the
magpie
had
not
come
and
now
perhaps
it
did
not
make
so
much
difference
where
was
he
going
now
his
foot
was
on
the
first
stair
and
suddenly
he
drew
it
back
the
cold
sweat
bursting
out
on
his
forehead
where
was
he
going
now
the
first
room
on
the
right
at
the
head
of
the
from
his
inner
consciousness
as
it
were
the
answer
in
all
the
bald
naked
horror
that
it
implied
flashed
upon
him
the
first
room
on
the
right
that
man
room
god
how
the
darkness
and
the
stillness
began
to
palpitate
again
and
suddenly
seem
to
shriek
out
at
him
over
and
over
the
one
single
ghastly
word
murder
it
had
been
with
him
that
thought
all
the
time
he
had
been
working
at
the
safe
but
it
had
been
there
then
only
subconsciously
like
some
heavy
nameless
dread
subjugated
for
the
moment
by
the
work
he
had
had
to
do
which
had
demanded
the
centred
attention
of
every
faculty
he
possessed
but
now
the
moment
had
come
when
there
was
only
that
before
him
only
that
nothing
else
only
that
the
man
upstairs
in
the
first
room
to
the
right
of
the
landing
why
did
he
hesitate
why
did
he
stand
there
while
the
priceless
moments
before
daylight
came
were
passing
the
man
was
a
murderer
a
blotch
on
society
and
his
life
already
forfeited
he
was
living
now
only
because
the
law
had
not
found
him
out
the
man
was
a
criminal
bloodstained
and
his
life
because
he
had
taken
her
father
life
and
had
tried
to
take
the
tocsin
own
life
stood
between
her
and
every
hope
of
happiness
robbing
her
even
literally
in
a
material
sense
of
everything
that
the
world
could
hold
for
her
why
did
he
hesitate
it
was
that
life
or
hers
it
was
the
only
way
he
put
his
foot
upon
the
bottom
step
again
paused
still
another
instant
and
then
began
stealthily
to
mount
the
stairs
the
darkness
there
had
never
been
it
seemed
such
darkness
before
the
stillness
he
had
never
known
silence
so
heavy
so
full
of
strange
premonitory
pulsings
a
silence
that
seemed
so
incongruously
full
of
clamouring
whispers
in
his
ears
it
must
be
those
imagined
whispers
that
were
affecting
his
nerve
for
now
as
he
gained
the
landing
and
slipped
his
automatic
from
his
pocket
his
hand
was
shaking
with
a
queer
twitching
motion
for
an
instant
fighting
for
his
he
stood
striving
to
locate
his
surroundings
through
the
darkness
the
staircase
was
a
circular
one
making
the
landing
nearly
at
the
front
of
the
house
and
rearward
from
this
the
tocsin
had
said
a
hallway
ran
down
the
centre
with
rooms
on
either
side
the
first
room
to
the
right
therefore
should
be
just
at
his
hand
he
reached
out
feeling
cautiously
there
was
nothing
he
edged
to
the
right
still
nothing
edged
a
little
farther
a
sense
of
bewilderment
growing
upon
him
and
finally
his
fingers
touched
the
wall
it
was
very
strange
the
hallway
must
be
much
wider
than
he
had
understood
it
to
be
from
what
she
had
said
he
moved
along
now
straight
ahead
of
him
his
hand
on
the
wall
feeling
for
the
door
and
with
every
step
his
bewilderment
increased
surely
there
must
be
some
mistake
perhaps
he
had
misunderstood
he
had
come
fully
twice
the
distance
that
one
would
expect
and
yet
there
was
no
door
ah
what
was
that
his
fingers
closed
on
soft
heavy
velvet
hangings
these
could
hardly
be
in
front
of
a
door
and
yet
what
else
could
it
be
he
drew
the
hangings
warily
apart
and
felt
behind
them
it
was
a
window
but
it
was
shuttered
in
some
way
evidently
for
he
could
not
see
out
jimmie
dale
stood
motionless
there
for
fully
a
minute
it
seemed
absurd
preposterous
the
conviction
that
was
being
forced
home
upon
him
that
there
were
no
rooms
on
the
side
of
the
corridor
at
all
but
that
was
not
like
the
tocsin
accurate
always
in
the
most
minute
details
the
room
must
be
still
farther
along
he
was
tempted
to
use
his
flashlight
but
that
as
long
as
he
could
feel
his
way
was
an
unnecessary
risk
a
flashlight
upstairs
where
a
door
might
be
ajar
or
even
wide
open
where
some
one
wakeful
that
man
himself
perhaps
might
see
it
was
quite
another
matter
than
a
flashlight
in
the
closed
and
deserted
library
below
he
went
on
once
more
still
guiding
himself
by
a
light
finger
touch
upon
the
wall
passed
another
portiere
similar
to
the
first
and
after
that
another
and
finally
stopped
by
bringing
up
abruptly
against
the
end
wall
of
the
house
it
was
certainly
very
strange
there
were
no
rooms
on
the
side
of
the
corridor
and
here
hanging
across
the
end
wall
was
another
of
those
ubiquitous
velvet
portieres
he
parted
it
and
a
little
to
his
surprise
found
a
window
that
was
not
shuttered
but
that
instead
was
heavily
barred
by
an
ornamental
grille
work
he
could
see
out
however
and
found
that
he
was
looking
directly
out
from
the
rear
of
the
house
a
lamp
from
the
side
street
threw
what
was
undoubtedly
the
garage
into
shadowy
outline
and
he
made
out
below
him
a
short
stretch
of
yard
between
the
garage
and
the
house
he
remembered
that
now
she
had
described
all
that
to
the
magpie
there
was
no
driveway
between
the
front
and
the
rear
the
house
being
on
the
corner
the
entrance
to
the
garage
was
directly
from
the
side
street
yes
she
had
described
all
that
exactly
as
it
was
but
he
dropped
the
portiere
and
faced
around
carrying
his
hand
in
a
nonplused
way
to
his
eyes
but
here
upstairs
within
the
house
it
was
not
as
she
had
said
it
was
at
all
what
did
it
mean
she
could
not
have
blundered
so
egregiously
as
that
unless
he
caught
his
breath
suddenly
unless
she
had
done
so
intentionally
was
that
it
had
she
surmised
formed
a
suspicion
of
what
was
in
his
mind
of
what
he
meant
to
do
and
taken
this
means
of
defeating
it
if
so
well
it
was
too
late
for
that
now
there
was
one
way
only
one
way
whatever
the
cost
whatever
it
might
mean
for
him
there
was
only
one
way
out
for
her
his
flashlight
was
in
his
hand
now
and
the
round
white
ray
shot
down
the
corridor
seemed
suddenly
to
falter
unsteadily
swept
in
through
an
open
door
that
was
almost
beside
him
and
then
as
though
a
nerveless
hand
held
it
the
ray
dropped
and
played
shakily
on
the
toe
of
his
boot
before
it
went
out
a
stifled
cry
rose
to
his
lips
something
cold
like
a
hand
of
ice
seemed
to
clutch
at
his
heart
those
portieres
the
wide
richly
carpeted
corridor
it
was
the
corridor
of
the
night
before
that
room
at
his
side
was
the
room
where
he
had
seen
hilton
travers
the
chauffeur
dead
lashed
in
a
chair
he
felt
the
sweat
beads
burst
out
anew
upon
his
forehead
it
was
the
crime
club
chapter
xv
retribution
his
brain
seemed
to
whirl
staggered
as
by
some
gigantic
ghastly
mockery
the
crime
club
here
he
had
thought
to
creep
upon
that
man
and
he
had
run
blindly
into
the
very
heart
and
centre
of
these
hell
fiends
nest
silently
he
stood
there
holding
his
breath
as
he
listened
now
motionless
as
a
statue
forcing
his
mind
to
think
he
remembered
that
last
night
his
impression
of
the
place
had
been
that
it
was
more
like
some
great
private
mansion
than
anything
else
well
he
had
been
right
it
seemed
he
could
have
laughed
aloud
sardonically
hysterically
it
was
not
so
strange
now
that
there
were
no
rooms
on
the
side
of
the
corridor
and
what
could
have
suited
their
purpose
better
what
by
its
very
location
its
unimpeachable
character
could
be
a
more
ideal
lair
for
them
than
this
house
and
how
grimly
simple
it
was
now
the
explanation
in
the
five
years
that
the
false
henry
lasalle
had
been
in
possession
they
had
cunningly
remodelled
the
upper
floor
that
was
all
it
was
quite
clear
now
why
the
man
never
entertained
why
he
had
never
been
caught
or
found
or
known
to
be
in
communication
with
his
fellow
conspirators
it
was
no
longer
curious
that
one
might
watch
the
door
of
the
house
for
months
at
a
stretch
and
go
unrewarded
for
one
pains
as
the
tocsin
had
done
when
access
to
the
house
by
those
who
frequented
it
was
so
easy
through
the
garage
on
the
side
street
and
from
the
garage
if
their
work
there
was
in
keeping
with
their
clever
contrivances
within
the
house
by
an
underground
connection
into
say
the
cellar
or
basement
again
jimmie
dale
checked
that
nervous
unnatural
inclination
to
laugh
aloud
was
there
anything
any
single
incident
any
single
detail
of
all
that
had
transpired
that
was
not
explained
borne
out
as
it
could
be
explained
and
borne
out
in
no
other
way
save
that
the
crime
club
should
be
no
other
than
this
very
house
itself
it
was
the
exposition
of
that
favourite
theory
of
his
it
was
so
obvious
that
therein
lay
its
security
he
had
mocked
at
the
magpie
not
many
moments
before
on
that
score
and
now
it
was
the
beam
in
his
own
eye
it
was
so
obvious
now
so
glaringly
obvious
that
the
crime
club
could
have
been
nowhere
else
so
obvious
with
every
word
of
the
tocsin
story
pointing
it
out
like
a
signpost
and
he
had
not
seen
it
and
then
suddenly
every
muscle
grew
strained
and
rigid
was
there
some
one
in
the
corridor
was
it
some
one
moving
or
was
it
only
fancy
he
listened
while
he
strained
his
eyes
through
the
darkness
there
was
no
sound
only
that
abnormal
heavy
silence
that
yes
he
remembered
that
too
now
that
had
clung
about
him
last
night
like
a
pall
he
could
see
nothing
hear
nothing
but
intuitively
bringing
a
cold
dismay
the
greater
because
it
was
something
unknown
intangible
he
felt
as
though
eyes
were
upon
him
that
even
in
the
darkness
he
was
being
watched
and
as
he
stood
there
then
slowly
there
crept
upon
jimmie
dale
the
sense
of
peril
and
disaster
it
was
not
intuition
now
it
was
certainty
he
was
trapped
it
was
the
part
of
a
fool
to
imagine
that
with
their
devil
cunning
their
cleverness
their
ingenuity
he
or
any
one
else
could
enter
that
house
unknown
to
its
occupants
had
he
made
electric
contact
when
he
had
opened
the
front
door
and
rung
a
signal
here
perhaps
upstairs
had
he
set
some
system
of
alarm
at
work
when
he
had
touched
that
window
what
did
it
matter
the
details
that
had
heralded
his
entrance
he
was
certain
now
that
his
presence
in
the
house
was
known
only
why
had
they
left
him
so
long
without
attack
he
shook
his
head
with
a
quick
impatient
movement
that
too
was
obvious
he
was
under
observation
who
was
he
why
had
he
come
was
he
simply
a
paltry
or
was
he
one
whom
they
had
a
real
need
to
fear
and
then
too
there
might
well
be
another
reason
it
was
far
from
likely
in
fact
unreasonable
to
imagine
that
all
the
men
he
had
seen
here
the
night
before
were
in
the
house
now
not
many
of
them
if
any
would
live
here
for
constant
daily
coming
and
going
even
through
the
garage
could
not
escape
notice
and
of
the
servants
probably
a
lesser
breed
of
criminal
some
of
them
at
least
no
doubt
were
engaged
at
that
moment
in
watching
his
own
house
on
riverside
drive
there
was
even
the
possibility
that
the
man
posing
as
henry
lasalle
was
for
the
time
being
here
alone
he
shook
his
head
again
he
could
hardly
hope
for
that
he
had
no
right
to
hope
for
anything
more
now
than
a
struggle
with
an
inevitably
fatal
ending
to
himself
but
one
in
which
at
least
he
could
sell
his
life
as
dearly
as
possible
one
in
which
perhaps
he
might
pay
the
score
with
the
man
he
had
come
to
find
if
he
could
do
that
well
after
all
the
price
was
not
too
great
there
were
no
tremours
of
the
muscles
now
it
was
jimmie
dale
the
gray
seal
every
faculty
alert
tense
keyed
up
to
its
highest
efficiency
the
brain
cool
keen
and
active
fighting
for
his
life
the
front
door
through
which
he
had
entered
was
an
impossibility
but
there
was
the
window
in
the
library
that
he
had
opened
if
they
would
let
him
get
that
far
that
was
as
good
a
chance
as
any
if
he
made
an
effort
to
find
say
a
way
to
the
flat
above
and
chanced
some
means
of
escape
there
it
would
in
no
wise
obviate
an
attack
upon
him
and
he
would
only
be
under
the
added
disadvantage
of
unfamiliar
surroundings
feeling
out
with
his
left
hand
his
automatic
thrown
a
little
forward
in
his
right
he
began
to
retrace
his
way
along
the
blank
wall
of
the
corridor
pausing
between
each
step
to
listen
moving
silently
his
tread
on
the
heavy
carpet
as
noiseless
as
though
it
were
some
shadow
creeping
there
stillness
utter
absolute
always
that
stillness
always
that
sense
of
danger
around
him
the
tense
bated
expectancy
of
momentary
attack
a
revolver
flash
through
the
darkness
a
sudden
rush
upon
him
but
still
there
was
nothing
only
the
darkness
only
the
silence
he
gained
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
began
to
descend
and
now
the
strain
began
to
tell
upon
his
nerves
again
again
he
was
possessed
of
the
mad
impulse
to
cry
out
to
do
anything
that
would
force
the
issue
that
would
end
the
horrible
unbearable
suspense
why
did
that
revolver
shot
not
come
why
had
they
not
yet
rushed
upon
him
why
were
they
playing
with
him
as
a
cat
with
a
mouse
or
was
it
all
wild
fanciful
imagination
no
what
was
that
again
he
could
have
sworn
this
time
that
he
had
heard
a
sound
but
he
could
neither
define
its
character
nor
locate
the
direction
from
which
it
had
come
he
was
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
now
and
guiding
himself
by
the
wall
moving
now
barely
an
inch
at
a
time
he
reached
the
library
door
that
he
had
left
open
and
stole
in
over
the
threshold
halfway
down
the
room
and
diagonally
across
from
where
he
stood
was
the
window
in
a
moment
now
he
could
gain
that
but
they
would
never
let
him
go
so
easily
and
so
it
must
come
now
in
that
next
moment
their
attack
where
were
they
where
were
they
now
the
table
he
must
remember
not
to
bump
into
the
table
a
pause
between
each
step
he
was
crossing
the
room
he
was
halfway
to
the
window
had
it
been
all
fancy
was
he
to
and
then
jimmie
dale
stood
motionless
some
one
had
closed
the
library
door
softly
stillness
again
a
sort
of
deadly
calm
upon
him
jimmie
dale
felt
out
behind
his
back
for
the
big
library
table
that
he
had
been
circuiting
if
the
window
were
wide
open
it
might
be
done
but
to
jump
for
it
and
stand
silhouetted
there
during
the
pause
necessary
to
fling
the
window
up
was
little
less
than
suicidal
he
edged
back
noiselessly
until
his
fingers
touched
the
table
then
lowering
himself
to
his
knees
he
backed
in
underneath
it
and
lay
flat
upon
the
floor
it
was
not
much
protection
but
it
had
one
advantage
if
they
switched
on
the
lights
it
would
show
an
empty
room
for
the
first
instant
and
that
instant
meant
the
first
shot
where
were
they
now
by
the
library
door
how
many
of
them
were
there
well
it
was
their
move
two
could
play
at
cat
and
mouse
until
until
daylight
that
was
very
far
off
now
and
when
that
came
he
might
still
have
the
first
shot
but
after
that
he
turned
his
head
quickly
toward
the
window
there
was
a
faint
scratching
noise
as
of
finger
nails
gripping
the
sill
then
the
window
very
slowly
almost
silently
was
pushed
steadily
upward
and
a
dark
form
loomed
up
outside
and
then
crawling
through
a
man
dropped
as
though
his
feet
were
padded
like
a
cat
on
the
floor
inside
the
room
the
magpie
a
flashlight
ray
shot
out
and
with
a
twisted
smile
propped
now
on
his
left
elbow
to
give
free
play
to
his
revolver
arm
jimmie
dale
followed
the
white
spot
eagerly
with
his
eyes
but
it
did
not
circle
around
instead
the
light
was
turned
almost
instantly
toward
the
lower
end
of
the
room
and
a
second
later
was
holding
steadily
on
the
open
door
of
the
safe
and
the
litter
of
papers
on
the
floor
came
a
savage
growl
of
amazed
fury
from
the
magpie
then
his
step
down
the
room
and
as
he
reached
the
safe
a
torrent
of
unbridled
blasphemy
and
then
in
a
sort
of
staggered
gasp
as
he
leaned
suddenly
forward
examining
the
knob
of
the
dial
the
gray
seal
a
moment
the
magpie
stood
there
and
then
cursing
again
in
abandon
turned
and
started
back
for
the
window
his
flashlight
dancing
before
him
and
stopped
a
snarl
of
fury
on
his
lips
the
flashlight
was
playing
full
on
jimmie
dale
under
the
table
larry
the
bat
the
gray
seal
by
god
choked
the
magpie
you
you
the
magpie
flashlight
as
he
shifted
it
from
his
right
hand
to
his
left
and
wrenched
out
his
revolver
had
fallen
upon
two
men
crouched
close
against
the
wall
by
the
library
door
and
he
screamed
out
in
an
access
of
fury
de
double
cross
a
plant
de
bulls
you
damned
snitch
larry
screamed
out
the
magpie
and
fired
the
bullet
tore
into
the
carpet
beside
jimmie
dale
came
answering
shots
from
the
men
by
the
door
and
then
the
magpie
emptying
his
automatic
at
the
two
men
as
he
ran
the
flame
tongues
cutting
vicious
lanes
of
fire
through
the
darkness
dashed
for
the
window
there
was
a
cry
the
crash
of
a
heavy
body
pitching
to
the
floor
and
the
magpie
had
flung
himself
out
through
the
window
and
in
the
momentary
ensuing
silence
within
the
room
came
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
running
on
the
gravel
below
there
was
a
low
moan
the
movement
as
of
some
one
staggering
and
lurching
around
and
then
the
lights
went
on
but
for
an
instant
jimmie
dale
did
not
move
he
was
staring
at
the
form
of
a
man
still
and
motionless
on
the
floor
in
front
of
him
the
man
who
had
posed
as
henry
lasalle
dead
the
man
was
dead
his
mind
ran
riot
for
a
moment
where
were
the
others
were
there
only
these
two
only
these
two
in
the
house
only
these
two
and
one
was
dead
and
then
jimmie
dale
was
on
his
feet
one
was
dead
but
there
was
still
the
other
the
man
who
was
reeling
there
back
turned
to
him
by
the
switch
but
even
as
jimmie
dale
sprang
forward
this
second
man
clawing
at
the
wall
for
support
slipped
to
his
knees
and
fell
upon
the
carpet
jimmie
dale
reached
him
snatched
the
revolver
from
his
hand
and
bent
over
him
it
was
the
man
whose
name
he
did
not
know
but
whose
face
he
had
reason
enough
to
know
too
well
it
was
the
leader
of
the
crime
club
the
man
though
evidently
badly
wounded
smiled
defiantly
in
spite
of
his
pain
so
you
the
gray
seal
he
flung
out
contemptuously
a
clever
enough
but
only
a
lowbrow
like
the
rest
of
them
another
illusion
dispelled
well
you
got
the
money
better
run
had
you
jimmie
dale
made
no
answer
satisfied
that
the
man
was
too
badly
hurt
to
move
he
went
and
bent
over
the
silent
form
in
the
centre
of
the
room
a
moment
examination
was
enough
henry
lasalle
was
dead
he
stood
there
looking
down
at
the
man
it
was
what
he
had
come
for
though
it
was
the
magpie
not
himself
who
had
accomplished
it
the
man
was
dead
the
words
began
to
run
through
his
mind
in
a
queer
reiteration
the
man
was
dead
the
man
was
dead
he
checked
himself
sharply
he
must
think
now
think
fast
and
think
right
the
magpie
knew
that
larry
the
bat
was
the
gray
seal
and
as
fast
as
the
magpie
could
get
there
the
news
would
spread
like
wildfire
through
the
underworld
death
to
the
gray
seal
death
to
the
gray
seal
he
could
hear
that
slogan
ringing
again
in
his
ears
but
as
he
had
never
heard
it
before
with
a
snarl
of
triumph
now
as
of
wolves
who
at
last
had
pulled
their
quarry
down
he
had
not
a
second
to
spare
and
yet
that
man
wounded
there
on
the
floor
what
of
him
guilty
of
murder
the
brains
of
this
inhuman
monstrous
organisation
the
one
to
whom
more
even
than
to
that
dead
man
the
tocsin
owed
the
horror
and
the
misery
and
the
grief
and
despair
that
had
come
into
her
life
what
of
him
what
of
the
crime
club
here
what
of
this
nest
of
vipers
were
they
to
escape
were
they
to
with
a
sudden
low
exclamation
jimmie
dale
jumped
for
the
table
and
snatching
up
the
telephone
rattled
the
hook
violently
give
me
his
voice
came
in
gasps
each
like
a
man
fighting
for
every
word
give
me
police
headquarters
quick
quick
i
been
shot
the
wounded
man
on
the
floor
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
what
are
you
doing
he
demanded
in
a
startled
way
are
you
mad
thank
your
stars
you
were
lucky
enough
to
get
out
of
this
alive
and
get
out
now
while

the
chance
jimmie
dale
pressed
his
hand
firmly
over
the
mouthpiece
of
the
telephone
i
go
he
said
with
a
cold
smile
when
i
settled
with
you
for
the
murder
of
henry
that
man
ejaculated
the
man
scornfully
pointing
to
the
form
on
the
floor
so
that
your
game
going
to
try
and
cover
your
tracks
why
you
fool
i
live
here
do
you
think
the
police
would
imagine
for
an
instant
that
i
killed
him
i
said
henry
lasalle
said
jimmie
dale
evenly
the
man
came
farther
up
on
his
elbow
a
sudden
look
of
fear
in
his
face
what
what
do
you
mean
he
cried
hoarsely
but
jimmie
dale
was
talking
again
into
the
telephone
gasping
choking
out
his
words
as
before
police
headquarters
i
henry
lasalle
fifth
avenue
i
i
been
shot
take
down
this
statement
i
i
be
dead
before

at
all
we

henry
lasalle
in
australia
and
murdered
peter
lasalle
here
we
we
tried
to
kill
the
daughter
but
she
ran
away
this
house
has
been
our
headquarters
for
the
last
five
years
the
man
who
shot
me
is
the
leader
of
the
gang
we
quarrelled
over
the
division
of
a
haul
he
here
on
the
floor
now
wounded
get
them
all
get
them
all
damn
them
do
you
hear
get
them
all
they
out
of
the
house
now
but
lay
a
trap
for
them
they
always
come
in
through
the
garage
on
the
side
street
oh
god
i
done
for
break
down
the
west
walls
of
the
rooms
upstairs
if
you
want
proof
of
what
the
gang
been
doing
hurry
hurry
i
i
done
for
i
jimmie
dale
permitted
the
telephone
to
drop
with
a
clash
from
his
hand
to
the
table
the
face
of
the
man
on
the
floor
was
livid
who
are
you
in
god
name
who
are
you
he
cried
out
wildly
does
it
matter
inquired
jimmie
dale
grimly
your
game
is
up
go
to
the
chair
for
the
murder
of
lasalle
if
it
is
by
proxy
those
rooms
upstairs
alone
are
enough
to
damn
you
to
prove
every
word
of
that
dying
but
added
to
it
will
come
the
story
of
marie
lasalle
for
a
moment
the
man
hung
there
swaying
on
his
elbow
his
face
working
in
ghastly
fashion
and
then
suddenly
with
a
strange
laugh
he
carried
one
hand
swiftly
to
his
mouth
and
laughed
again
and
before
jimmie
dale
could
reach
him
was
lifeless
on
the
floor
a
tiny
vial
rolled
away
upon
the
carpet
jimmie
dale
picked
it
up
a
drop
or
two
of
liquid
still
remained
in
it
colourless
clear
like
that
liquid
this
same
man
had
dropped
into
the
rabbit
mouth
the
night
before
like
the
liquid
in
the
glasses
they
had
carried
into
that
third
room
like
the
liquid
that
his
man
had
said
was
from
a
formula
of
their
own
that
was
instantaneous
in
its
action
that
defied
detection
by
autopsy
the
set
stern
features
of
jimmie
dale
relaxed
it
was
justice
but
it
was
also
death
in
a
surge
of
emotion
the
events
of
scarcely
more
than
hours
began
to
crowd
upon
him
and
then
ominously
dominant
above
all
else
that
slogan
of
the
underworld
death
to
the
gray
seal
came
ringing
once
more
in
his
ears
it
brought
him
with
a
startled
movement
of
his
hand
across
his
eyes
to
a
realisation
of
his
own
desperate
position
yes
yes
he
must
go
the
way
was
clear
now
for
the
tocsin
clear
now
for
her
he
dropped
the
vial
into
his
pocket
and
running
to
the
safe
quickly
scraped
the
gray
seal
from
the
dial
knob
then
he
drew
the
packages
of
money
from
his
shirt
and
pockets
and
tossed
them
on
the
floor
among
the
litter
of
papers
already
there
she
would
get
it
back
again
when
it
had
served
its
purpose
it
would
be
that
it
was
the
proceeds
of
that
day
sale
of
the
estate
securities
over
which
the
quarrel
had
occurred
and
now
the
window
he
ran
to
it
closed
it
and
locked
it
then
laying
the
revolver
he
had
taken
from
the
leader
down
beside
the
man
he
stepped
across
the
room
again
and
drew
the
body
of
henry
lasalle
closer
to
the
table
as
though
the
man
had
fallen
there
when
the
telephone
had
dropped
from
his
hand
it
was
done
now
on
the
floor
beside
him
lay
each
man
weapon
and
both
of
the
revolvers
had
been
discharged
several
times
jimmie
dale
paused
on
the
library
threshold
for
a
final
survey
of
the
room
it
was
done
the
way
was
clear
for
her
and
now
if
he
could
only
save
himself
there
was
no
chance
for
larry
the
bat
could
he
save
jimmie
dale
he
crossed
the
hall
a
queer
smile
on
his
lips
unlocked
the
front
door
stepped
out
locked
it
behind
him
and
in
another
moment
doubling
around
the
corner
was
running
along
like
a
hare
along
the
side
street
chapter
xvi
death
to
the
gray
seal
on
jimmie
dale
ran
across
on
fourth
avenue
he
swung
on
a
car
that
took
him
to
astor
place
then
striking
east
once
more
making
a
detour
to
avoid
the
bowery
he
ran
on
at
top
speed
again
to
reach
the
sanctuary
not
before
the
magpie
should
have
spread
the
alarm
that
was
impossible
but
to
reach
it
before
the
underworld
should
have
had
time
to
recover
its
breath
as
it
were
before
the
underworld
should
have
had
time
to
act
that
was
his
only
chance
the
magpie
had
at
the
outside
a
start
of
fifteen
minutes
but
he
jimmie
dale
had
probably
retrieved
five
minutes
of
that
in
the
time
he
had
made
in
getting
downtown
that
left
the
magpie
ten
to
the
good
how
long
would
it
take
the
magpie
to
bring
the
underworld
swarming
like
hornets
around
the
sanctuary
on
larry
the
bat
ran
at
the
sanctuary
were
the
clothes
the
belongings
of
jimmie
dale
could
he
save
jimmie
dale
if
he
could
get
there
change
and
get
out
again
the
way
was
clear
for
him
as
clear
as
for
the
tocsin
now
in
a
few
hours
the
police
would
have
every
member
of
the
crime
club
in
the
trap
there
would
be
no
watch
any
more
around
his
house
on
riverside
drive
and
he
would
be
free
to
return
there
and
resume
his
normal
life
as
jimmie
dale
again
if
he
could
make
the
sanctuary
in
time
but
let
the
magpie
get
there
first
let
the
underworld
tear
the
place
to
pieces
in
its
fury
as
it
would
do
let
them
discover
that
hiding
place
under
the
flooring
for
instance
and
the
gray
seal
would
not
be
merely
larry
the
bat
but
jimmie
dale
as
well
and
a
cry
escaped
him
even
as
he
ran
it
meant
ruin
the
disgrace
of
an
honoured
name
death
crimes
without
number
at
his
door
crimes
the
gray
seal
had
never
committed
a
crime
but
the
crimes
attributed
to
the
gray
seal
he
could
not
disprove
not
one
of
them
he
had
meant
them
to
appear
as
crimes
and
he
had
succeeded
so
well
that
the
gray
name
execrated
was
a
synonym
for
the
most
callous
dangerous
and
unscrupulous
criminal
of
the
age
he
was
gasping
for
breath
as
finally
making
for
the
side
door
he
darted
into
the
alleyway
that
flanked
the
sanctuary
what
story
would
the
magpie
tell
not
the
truth
of
course
that
would
let
the
magpie
in
for
what
had
happened
that
night
for
the
magpie
must
be
well
aware
that
he
had
shot
at
least
one
of
the
two
men
in
that
room
but
the
truth
was
necessary
it
was
foreign
and
had
no
bearing
on
the
one
outstanding
fact
the
gray
seal
was
larry
the
bat
at
the
present
moment
the
magpie
had
a
double
incentive
for
getting
the
gray
seal
the
gray
seal
was
the
only
one
who
could
prove
murder
against
him
that
night
in
the
lasalle
mansion
and
afterwards
when
the
police
version
of
the
affair
was
made
public
the
magpie
to
save
himself
would
be
careful
enough
to
do
or
say
nothing
to
contradict
henry
lasalle
confession
larry
the
bat
slipped
in
through
the
door
halted
there
listened
and
then
began
to
mount
the
rickety
stairs
with
his
silent
tread
at
the
top
he
paused
again
nothing
no
sound
they
were
not
here
yet
so
far
he
was
in
time
he
stepped
to
the
sanctuary
door
unlocked
it
passed
into
the
squalid
miserable
room
that
had
harboured
him
for
so
long
as
larry
the
bat
locked
the
door
behind
him
crossed
quickly
to
the
window
to
make
sure
that
the
shutters
were
closed
and
then
for
the
first
time
as
the
gray
light
streaked
in
through
the
interstices
he
was
conscious
that
it
was
already
dawn
so
much
the
more
need
for
haste
then
he
whipped
out
his
revolver
and
laid
it
at
his
hand
on
the
dilapidated
table
then
the
flooring
in
the
corner
was
up
in
an
instant
and
he
began
to
strip
off
the
rags
of
larry
the
bat
boots
mismated
socks
the
torn
patched
trousers
the
greasy
flannel
shirt
the
threadbare
coat
the
nondescript
slouch
hat
were
thrown
in
a
pile
on
the
floor
and
with
them
from
their
the
grease
paints
and
heterogeneous
collection
of
accessories
this
done
he
began
to
slip
on
the
clothes
of
jimmie
dale
and
when
half
dressed
turned
to
the
table
again
to
remove
the
characteristic
grime
stain
and
paint
of
larry
the
bat
from
face
hands
wrists
throat
and
neck
this
was
a
longer
more
arduous
task
he
reached
for
the
cracked
pitcher
to
pour
more
water
into
the
basin
and
snatching
up
his
revolver
instead
whirled
to
face
the
door
some
one
was
outside
he
had
caught
the
creak
of
a
footstep
upon
the
stairs
in
a
flash
he
was
across
the
room
and
crouched
by
the
door
yes
the
step
was
nearer
now
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
on
the
landing
his
revolver
lifted
holding
a
steady
bead
on
the
door
panel
and
then
there
came
a
low
voice
jimmie
jimmie
are
you
there
quick
jimmie
are
you
there
the
tocsin
what
was
she
doing
here
why
had
he
not
warned
her
up
there
on
the
avenue
fool
that
he
was
that
of
all
places
she
was
to
keep
away
from
here
she
slipped
into
the
room
as
he
unlocked
the
door
they
coming
jimmie
she
panted
breathlessly
there
not
an
instant
to
lose
listen
when
the
magpie
ran
from
the
house
i
ran
with
him
but
it
she
tried
to
smile
it
was
to
obey
you
to
run
away
i
had
made
up
my
mind
i
would
do
that
it
was
to
find
out
from
him
what
had
happened
he
told
me
you
were
the
gray
seal
he
did
not
suspect
me
he
thinks
you
were
no
more
than
just
larry
the
bat
to
me
as
you
were
to
everybody
else
he
went
straight
to
chicago
ike
gambling
rooms
and
found
the
skeeter
gang
there
you
know
them
red
mose
the
midget
harve
thoms
and
the
skeeter
you
remember
your
fight
with
them
over
old
luddy
diamonds
well
they
have
not
forgotten
either
they
are
on
their
way
here
now
the
news
that
you
are
the
gray
seal
is
travelling
like
lightning
all
through
the
underworld
there
will
be
a
mob
here
on
the
skeeter
heels
so
jimmie
quick
run
run
half
larry
the
bat
half
jimmie
dale
and
run
in
another
five
minutes
perhaps
yes
but
there
probably
would
not
be
five
minutes
and
she
if
she
were
found
here
yes
he
said
quietly
i
get
away
in
a
moment
you
go
at
once
i
he
was
smiling
at
her
reassuringly
i
meet
you
at
she
looked
at
him
then
for
an
instant
interrupting
him
quickly
as
she
shook
her
head
i
did
notice
jimmie
you
can
not
go
like
that
can
you
it
would
be
even
worse
than
being
caught
as
larry
the
bat
hurry
then
i
am
not
going
without
no
he
said
go
now
go
at
once
marie
while
you
can
you
have
risked
your
life
as
it
is
to
come
here
and
tell
me
this
for
god
sake
go
now
the
great
brown
eyes
were
smiling
bravely
through
a
sudden
mist
she
shook
her
head
again
not
without
you
it
brought
a
fierce
wild
throb
of
joy
upon
him
and
then
a
cold
sickening
fear
listen
he
cried
out
desperately
you
must
go
now
you
can
not
take
any
chances
now
marie
everything
is
right
for
you
that
man
who
posed
as
your
uncle
is
dead
the
leader
of
the
crime
club
is
dead
do
you
understand
what
that
means
you
have
only
to
be
marie
lasalle
again
and
claim
your
own
i
can
not
tell
you
all
now
there
no
time
that
house
was
the
crime
club
itself
the
police
will
get
them
all
do
you
see
do
you
see
everything
is
clear
for
you
now
and
now
go
go
you
must
go
she
was
staring
at
him
a
strange
wonder
in
her
face
clear
all
clear
for
me
i
i
can
go
back
to
to
my
own
life
again
it
was
as
though
she
were
whispering
some
amazing
thing
of
unbelievable
joy
to
herself
yes
he
cried
out
again
yes
but
go
go
marie
but
now
for
answer
suddenly
she
reached
out
and
took
the
key
from
the
door
and
put
it
in
the
pocket
of
her
dress
we
will
go
together
jimmie
or
not
at
all
she
said
simply
we
are
wasting
precious
moments
hurry
and
dress
he
hesitated
miserably
what
could
he
do
if
she
would
not
go
and
it
was
true
the
moments
were
flying
better
rather
than
futile
argument
to
use
them
as
she
said
there
was
still
a
chance
why
not
five
minutes
he
could
do
better
than
that
he
must
do
better
than
that
without
a
word
he
ran
back
across
the
room
in
frantic
haste
from
face
hands
wrists
and
neck
came
the
stain
there
was
still
time
she
was
standing
there
by
the
door
listening
she
the
tocsin
she
whom
he
loved
she
who
all
through
the
years
that
had
gone
had
been
so
strangely
elusive
and
yet
so
intimately
a
part
of
his
life
she
was
standing
there
now
here
with
him
in
peril
with
every
second
that
passed
he
had
only
to
slip
on
his
coat
and
vest
now
and
make
a
bundle
of
larry
the
bat
things
on
the
floor
so
that
he
could
carry
them
away
to
destroy
them
he
stooped
to
gather
up
the
clothes
and
straightened
suddenly
and
jumped
toward
the
door
again
they
are
coming
jimmie
she
called
in
a
low
voice
but
he
had
already
heard
them
the
stairs
were
creaking
loudly
under
the
tread
of
many
feet
he
pushed
the
tocsin
hurriedly
back
against
the
wall
at
the
side
of
the
door
stand
there
he
said
under
his
breath
out
of
the
line
of
fire
do
move
there
was
a
rush
against
the
door
and
then
a
voice
growled
aw
cut
dat
out
wot
do
youse
want
to
do
scare
him
away
by
bustin
it
pick
de
lock
an
we
lay
for
him
inside
till
he
shows
it
was
the
skeeter
voice
the
skeeter
and
his
gang
the
worst
apaches
in
the
city
of
new
york
professional
assassins
death
contractors
he
had
called
them
and
the
lowest
bidders
a
man
life
any
time
for
dollars
no
they
were
not
likely
to
forget
the
affair
of
the
pushcart
man
to
forget
old
luddy
and
his
diamonds
to
forget
the
gray
seal
and
they
were
only
the
vanguard
of
what
was
to
come
some
one
was
working
at
the
lock
now
there
was
one
way
to
stop
that
it
would
not
take
them
long
to
find
out
that
he
was
there
once
the
door
was
opened
better
know
it
with
the
door
shut
jimmie
dale
lifted
his
revolver
coolly
and
fired
through
the
panel
a
burst
of
yells
answered
the
shot
and
among
them
high
above
the
others
the
magpie
scream
we
got
him
we
got
him
he
dere
now
and
then
it
seemed
that
pandemonium
broke
loose
there
was
a
volley
of
shots
the
bullets
splintering
through
the
door
panels
as
from
a
machine
gun
so
fast
they
came
and
then
another
rush
against
the
door
flat
on
the
floor
but
well
back
and
to
one
side
jimmie
dale
fired
steadily
again
and
again
came
screams
of
pain
yells
and
oaths
and
they
fell
back
from
the
door
and
now
from
above
from
overhead
came
tumult
windows
thrown
up
the
stamp
of
feet
cries
of
fright
and
from
the
street
a
low
sullen
roar
the
underworld
was
gathering
fast
once
more
the
rush
upon
the
door
and
jimmie
dale
a
grim
twisted
smile
upon
his
lips
emptied
his
revolver
into
the
panels
once
more
they
fell
back
and
then
there
came
the
skeeter
voice
snarling
like
an
infuriated
beast
he
get
de
lot
of
us
like
dis
cut
it
out
besides
we
have
de
bulls
down
here

a
minute

alongside
watch
if
dey
likes
but
he
our
jimmie
dale
did
not
dare
to
look
at
the
tocsin
face
mechanically
he
refilled
the
magazine
of
his
automatic
and
lay
there
waiting
the
roar
from
the
street
grew
louder
they
seemed
to
be
fighting
out
there
as
though
an
inadequate
number
of
police
were
trying
to
disperse
a
mob
and
not
succeeding
pretty
soon
with
the
riot
call
in
there
would
probably
be
a
battle
for
the
gray
seal
sublime
irony
it
was
death
at
the
hands
of
either
one
children
whimpered
on
the
stairs
outside
men
swore
women
cried
feet
shuffled
hurriedly
by
as
the
tenement
emptied
occasionally
a
pertinent
invitation
to
him
to
remain
where
he
was
there
was
a
vicious
rip
through
the
panel
and
the
drumming
whir
of
a
bullet
flying
through
the
room
and
then
a
curious
ominous
crackling
sound
and
then
the
smell
of
smoke
jimmie
dale
stood
up
his
face
drawn
and
haggard
the
tenement
would
go
like
matchwood
burn
like
a
bonfire
with
any
kind
of
a
start
and
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
start
the
skeeter
the
magpie
and
the
rest
would
have
seen
that
it
had
headway
enough
to
serve
their
purpose
before
either
firemen
or
police
could
thwart
them
he
jimmie
dale
could
take
his
choice
walk
out
into
a
bullet
or
stay
there
and
he
smiled
miserably
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
pile
of
larry
the
bat
clothing
on
the
floor
there
was
no
longer
need
to
worry
about
its
destruction
the
fire
would
take
care
of
that
only
too
well
and
then
a
low
bitter
cry
came
to
his
lips
and
he
clenched
his
hands
if
it
were
only
himself
only
himself
he
crossed
to
the
tocsin
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
oh
my
god
marie
he
faltered
the
cape
and
hood
had
fallen
from
her
and
with
the
hood
had
fallen
the
hair
of
silver
mag
and
now
as
she
smiled
at
him
it
was
from
a
face
that
was
very
beautiful
and
very
brave
and
very
full
of
tenderness
and
he
held
her
there
and
neither
spoke
it
seeped
in
under
the
threshold
of
the
door
it
came
from
everywhere
filling
the
room
the
black
strangling
smoke
outside
in
the
hall
all
was
silence
now
save
for
that
crackle
of
flame
that
grew
in
volume
that
came
now
in
quick
sharp
reports
like
revolver
shots
from
out
in
the
street
swelled
a
cry
death
to
the
gray
seal
then
the
clang
of
bells
the
roar
and
rattle
of
fire
apparatus
strident
voices
bellowing
orders
and
the
crowd
again
blood
hungry
death
to
the
gray
seal
there
was
a
chance
just
one
if
the
fire
had
no
headway
along
the
upper
end
of
the
landing
and
if
they
had
not
thought
to
set
a
watch
for
him
above
they
the
magpie
the
skeeter
and
his
gang
must
have
been
driven
even
out
of
the
house
now
by
the
smoke
and
flame
give
me
the
key
i
am
going
to
open
the
door
marie
he
said
quietly
cover
your
face
with
a
handkerchief
anything
and
run
to
the
left
to
the
next
flight
of
stairs
there
are
two
flats
above
this
we
make
the
roof
if
we
can
now
are
you
ready
it
was
an
instant
before
she
answered
an
instant
in
which
she
lifted
her
face
to
his
and
held
his
face
between
her
two
hands
and
then
i
am
ready
he
flung
open
the
door
his
arm
around
her
to
help
her
forward
and
instinctively
with
a
cry
fell
back
for
a
moment
with
the
inrush
of
the
draft
poured
the
smoke
and
through
it
lurid
yellow
showed
the
flames
leaping
from
the
stair
well
and
then
all
was
blind
madness
together
they
ran
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
fell
recovered
herself
staggered
up
another
and
fell
again
he
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
and
staggering
now
as
she
had
staggered
went
on
his
lungs
seemed
to
be
bursting
his
limbs
grew
weak
and
trembled
under
him
he
could
not
see
or
breathe
the
nauseating
fumes
suffocated
him
bringing
an
intolerable
agony
he
gained
the
first
landing
above
there
was
one
more
one
more
if
he
could
only
rest
here
for
a
moment
yes
that
was
it
rest
it
was
so
bad
here
now
she
stirred
in
his
arms
struggled
to
her
feet
and
he
was
helping
her
on
again
and
up
the
next
flight
of
stairs
and
suddenly
he
found
himself
laughing
in
hysteria
for
they
were
climbing
a
half
stair
half
ladderway
at
the
end
of
the
upper
landing
and
the
open
skylight
was
above
them
and
they
were
drinking
in
the
pure
fresh
air
and
now
they
were
out
upon
the
roof
and
the
roar
from
the
street
was
in
their
ears
like
the
roar
of
great
waters
from
some
canyon
far
below
jimmie
dale
tried
to
speak
and
found
his
lips
were
cracked
and
dry
he
wet
them
with
his
tongue
do
stand
up
we
be
seen
crawl
he
mumbled
hoarsely
it
took
a
long
time
over
one
roof
and
then
another
and
yet
another
and
then
through
the
skylight
of
a
tenement
whose
occupants
were
either
craning
from
the
front
windows
or
were
on
the
street
below
it
was
perhaps
half
an
hour
and
then
they
too
were
standing
in
the
street
and
all
about
them
the
crowd
was
shouting
in
wild
excitement
up
the
block
inside
the
fire
lines
the
sanctuary
was
blazing
furiously
and
now
suddenly
the
wall
seemed
to
bulge
outward
it
brought
a
yell
from
the
crowd
death
to
the
gray
seal
she
pulled
at
his
arm
let
us
get
away
let
us
get
away
jimmie
she
whispered
frantically
a
strange
smile
was
on
jimmie
dale
lips
we
safe
now
for
always
he
whispered
back
look
the
sanctuary
wall
bulged
farther
outward
seemed
to
hang
an
instant
hesitant
in
and
fell
with
a
mighty
crash
the
gray
seal
was
dead
