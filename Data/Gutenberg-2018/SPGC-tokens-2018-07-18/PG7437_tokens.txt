rain
rain
rain
how
mercilessly
it
fell
on
the
that
sunday
afternoon
every
moment
the
pools
increased
and
the
mud
became
thicker
how
dismal
the
fair
looked
then
on
saturday
evening
it
had
been
brilliantly
lighted
with
rows
of
flaring
and
the
grand
shows
in
the
most
aristocratic
part
of
the
field
had
been
illuminated
with
crosses
stars
anchors
and
all
manner
of
devices
but
there
were
no
lights
now
there
was
nothing
to
cast
a
halo
round
the
dirty
tents
and
the
dingy
caravans
yet
in
spite
of
this
and
in
spite
of
the
rain
a
crowd
of
sunday
idlers
lingered
about
the
fair
looking
with
great
interest
at
the
whirligigs
and
bicycles
peeping
curiously
into
the
deserted
shows
and
making
many
schemes
for
further
enjoyment
on
the
morrow
when
the
fair
was
once
more
to
be
in
its
glory
inside
the
caravans
the
were
crouching
over
their
fires
and
grumbling
at
the
weather
murmuring
at
having
to
pay
so
much
for
the
ground
on
which
their
shows
were
erected
at
a
time
when
they
would
be
likely
to
make
so
little
profit
a
little
old
man
with
a
rosy
face
was
making
his
way
across
the
sea
of
mud
which
divided
the
shows
from
each
other
he
was
evidently
no
idler
in
the
fair
he
had
come
into
it
that
sunday
afternoon
for
a
definite
purpose
and
he
did
not
intend
to
leave
it
until
it
was
accomplished
after
crossing
an
almost
impassable
place
he
climbed
the
steps
leading
to
one
of
the
caravans
and
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
a
curious
door
the
upper
part
of
it
being
used
as
a
window
was
filled
with
glass
behind
which
you
could
see
two
small
muslin
curtains
tied
up
with
pink
ribbon
no
one
came
to
open
the
door
when
the
old
man
knocked
and
he
was
about
to
turn
away
when
some
little
boys
who
were
standing
near
called
out
to
him
again
sir
rap
again
there
a
little
lass
in
there
she
went
in
a
bit
since
you
wish
you
was
her
said
one
of
the
little
boys
to
the
other
said
the
little
fellow
wish
house
would
move
about
and
had
little
windows
with
white
curtains
and
pink
bows
the
old
man
laughed
a
hearty
laugh
at
the
children
talk
and
rapped
again
at
the
caravan
door
this
time
a
face
appeared
between
the
muslin
curtains
and
peered
cautiously
out
it
was
a
very
pretty
little
face
so
pretty
that
the
old
man
sighed
to
himself
when
he
saw
it
then
the
small
head
turned
round
and
seemed
to
be
telling
what
it
had
seen
to
some
one
within
and
asking
leave
to
admit
the
visitor
for
a
minute
afterwards
the
door
was
opened
and
the
owner
of
the
pretty
face
stood
before
the
old
man
she
was
a
little
girl
about
twelve
years
of
age
very
slender
and
delicate
in
appearance
her
hair
which
was
of
a
rich
auburn
colour
was
hanging
down
to
her
waist
and
her
eyes
were
the
most
beautiful
the
old
man
thought
he
had
ever
seen
she
was
very
poorly
dressed
and
she
shivered
as
the
damp
cold
air
rushed
in
through
the
open
door
afternoon
my
little
dear
said
the
old
man
she
was
just
going
to
answer
him
when
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
from
within
caused
her
to
look
round
and
when
it
was
over
a
weak
querulous
voice
said
hurriedly
the
door
rosalie
it
so
cold
ask
whoever
it
is
to
come
in
the
old
man
did
not
wait
for
a
second
invitation
he
stepped
inside
the
caravan
and
the
child
closed
the
door
it
was
a
very
small
place
there
was
hardly
room
for
him
to
stand
at
the
end
of
the
caravan
was
a
narrow
bed
something
like
a
berth
on
board
ship
and
on
it
a
woman
was
lying
who
was
evidently
very
she
was
the
mother
the
old
man
felt
sure
she
had
the
same
beautiful
eyes
and
sunny
hair
though
her
face
was
thin
and
wasted
there
was
not
room
for
much
furniture
in
the
small
caravan
a
tiny
stove
the
chimney
of
which
went
through
the
wooden
roof
a
few
pans
a
shelf
containing
cups
and
saucers
and
two
boxes
which
served
as
seats
completely
filled
it
there
was
only
just
room
for
the
old
man
to
stand
and
the
fire
was
so
near
him
that
he
was
in
danger
of
being
scorched
rosalie
had
seated
herself
on
one
of
the
boxes
close
to
her
mother
bed
must
excuse
my
intruding
said
the
old
man
with
a
polite
bow
i
so
fond
of
little
folks
and
i
brought
this
little
girl
of
yours
a
picture
if
she
will
accept
it
from
me
a
flush
of
pleasure
came
into
the
child
face
as
he
brought
out
of
his
pocket
his
promised
gift
she
seized
it
eagerly
and
held
it
up
before
her
with
evident
delight
whilst
her
mother
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
to
look
at
it
with
her
it
was
the
picture
of
a
shepherd
with
a
very
kind
and
compassionate
face
who
was
bearing
home
in
his
bosom
a
lost
lamb
the
lamb
fleece
was
torn
in
several
places
and
there
were
marks
of
blood
on
its
back
as
if
it
had
been
roughly
used
by
some
cruel
beast
in
a
recent
struggle
but
the
shepherd
seemed
to
have
suffered
more
than
the
lamb
for
he
was
wounded
in
many
places
and
his
blood
was
falling
in
large
drops
on
the
ground
yet
he
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
his
face
was
full
of
love
and
full
of
joy
as
he
looked
at
the
lamb
he
had
forgotten
his
sorrow
in
his
joy
that
the
lamb
was
saved
in
the
distance
were
some
of
the
shepherd
friends
who
were
coming
to
meet
him
and
underneath
the
picture
were
these
words
printed
in
large
letters
with
me
for
i
have
found
my
sheep
which
was
lost
there
is
joy
in
the
presence
of
the
angels
of
god
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
the
little
girl
read
the
words
aloud
in
a
clear
distinct
voice
and
her
mother
gazed
at
the
picture
with
tears
in
her
eyes
are
sweet
words
ai
they
said
the
old
man
said
the
woman
with
a
sigh
have
heard
them
many
times
before
the
good
shepherd
ever
said
them
of
has
he
ever
called
the
bright
angels
together
and
said
to
them
of
rejoice
with
me
for
i
have
found
my
sheep
which
was
lost
the
woman
did
not
speak
a
fit
of
coughing
came
on
and
the
old
man
stood
looking
at
her
with
a
very
pitying
expression
are
very
ill
i
afraid
he
said
very
ill
gasped
the
woman
bitterly
one
can
see
that
but
augustus
my
father
said
the
little
girl
he
does
see
it
repeated
the
woman
thinks
i
ought
to
get
up
and
act
in
the
play
just
as
usual
i
did
try
at
the
last
place
we
went
to
but
i
fainted
as
soon
as
my
part
was
over
and
i
been
in
bed
ever
since
must
be
tired
of
moving
about
said
the
old
man
compassionately
said
she
should
think
i
tired
it
is
what
i
was
brought
up
to
i
was
brought
up
to
a
very
different
kind
of
life
from
she
said
with
a
very
sigh
a
weary
time
i
have
of
it
a
weary
time
you
always
on
the
move
asked
the
old
man
the
said
the
woman
get
into
lodgings
for
a
little
time
in
the
winter
and
then
we
let
ourselves
out
to
some
of
the
small
town
theatres
but
all
the
rest
of
the
year
we
going
from
feast
to
feast
and
from
fair
to
fair
no
rest
nor
comfort
not
a
bit
thing
poor
thing
said
the
old
man
and
then
a
choking
sensation
appeared
to
have
seized
him
for
he
cleared
his
throat
vigorously
many
times
but
seemed
unable
to
say
more
the
child
had
climbed
on
one
of
the
boxes
and
brought
down
a
square
red
pincushion
from
the
shelf
which
ran
round
the
top
of
the
caravan
from
this
she
took
two
pins
and
fastened
the
picture
on
the
wooden
wall
so
that
her
mother
could
see
it
as
she
was
lying
in
bed
does
look
pretty
there
said
the
little
girl
you
can
look
at
it
nicely
now
said
the
old
man
as
he
prepared
to
take
his
leave
as
you
look
at
it
think
of
that
good
shepherd
who
is
seeking
you
he
wants
to
find
you
and
take
you
up
in
his
arms
and
carry
you
home
and
he
mind
the
wounds
it
has
cost
him
if
you
only
let
him
do
it
said
the
old
man
shall
maybe
never
see
you
again
but
i
would
like
the
good
shepherd
to
say
those
words
of
you
he
went
carefully
down
the
steps
of
the
caravan
and
rosalie
stood
at
the
window
watching
him
picking
his
way
to
the
other
shows
to
which
he
was
carrying
the
same
message
of
peace
she
looked
out
from
between
the
muslin
curtains
until
he
had
quite
disappeared
to
a
distant
part
of
the
field
and
then
she
turned
to
her
mother
and
said
eagerly
a
very
pretty
picture
is
it
mammie
dear
but
no
answer
came
from
the
bed
rosalie
thought
her
mother
was
asleep
and
crept
on
tiptoe
to
her
side
fearful
of
waking
her
but
she
found
her
mother
face
buried
in
the
pillow
on
which
large
tears
were
falling
and
when
the
little
girl
sat
down
by
her
side
and
tried
to
comfort
her
by
stroking
her
hand
very
gently
and
saying
dear
mammie
dear
cry
what
the
matter
mammie
dear
her
mother
only
wept
the
more
at
length
her
sobs
brought
on
such
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
that
rosalie
was
much
alarmed
and
fetched
her
a
mug
of
water
which
was
standing
on
the
shelf
near
the
door
by
degrees
her
mother
grew
calmer
the
sobs
became
less
frequent
and
to
the
little
girl
joy
she
fell
asleep
rosalie
sat
beside
her
without
moving
lest
she
should
awake
her
and
kept
gazing
at
her
picture
till
she
knew
every
line
of
it
and
the
first
thing
her
mother
heard
when
she
awoke
from
sleep
was
rosalie
voice
saying
softly
rejoice
with
me
for
i
have
found
my
sheep
which
was
lost
there
is
joy
in
the
presence
of
the
angels
of
god
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
chapter
ii
the
little
theatre
it
was
the
next
evening
the
fair
was
once
more
in
its
glory
and
crowded
with
an
admiring
throng
the
great
shows
were
again
illuminated
and
three
rows
of
brilliant
stars
shone
forth
from
the
little
theatre
belonging
to
rosalie
father
he
had
been
out
all
day
strolling
about
the
town
and
had
only
returned
in
time
to
make
preparation
for
the
entertainment
said
her
husband
as
he
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
of
the
caravan
you
mean
to
come
and
take
your
part
ca
augustus
and
you
would
know
it
if
you
stayed
long
enough
with
me
i
been
coughing
nearly
the
whole
day
i
wish
you
would
get
better
soon
it
very
awkward
to
have
to
fill
your
part
up
every
time
conrad
has
to
take
it
and
every
one
can
see
not
used
to
it
he
so
clumsy
and
slow
come
as
soon
as
ever
i
can
said
the
poor
wife
with
a
sigh
to
be
hoped
you
will
said
her
husband
are
always
fancying
they
are
ill
they
lie
still
thinking
about
it
and
nursing
themselves
up
long
after
a
man
would
have
been
at
his
work
again
it
half
laziness
that
what
it
is
said
augustus
fiercely
you
felt
as
ill
as
i
do
augustus
said
his
wife
sure
you
would
do
any
work
your
tongue
said
her
husband
know
better
than
that
well
mind
you
have
rosalie
ready
in
time
we
shall
begin
early
little
rosalie
had
crept
to
her
mother
side
and
was
crying
quietly
at
her
father
rough
words
crying
this
minute
child
said
augustus
harshly
your
eyes
you
great
baby
do
you
think
you
be
fit
to
come
on
the
stage
if
red
and
swollen
with
crying
do
you
hear
me
stop
at
once
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
he
shouted
as
he
shut
the
caravan
door
darling
said
her
mother
must
cry
your
father
will
be
so
angry
and
it
time
you
got
ready
what
a
noise
there
is
in
the
fair
already
said
the
poor
woman
holding
her
aching
head
rosalie
wiped
her
eyes
and
washed
her
face
and
then
brought
out
from
one
of
the
boxes
the
dress
in
which
she
was
to
act
at
the
play
it
was
a
white
muslin
dress
looped
up
with
pink
roses
and
there
was
a
wreath
of
paper
roses
to
wear
in
her
hair
she
dressed
herself
before
a
tiny
and
then
went
to
her
mother
to
have
the
wreath
of
roses
fastened
on
her
head
the
poor
woman
raised
herself
in
bed
and
arranged
her
little
girl
long
tresses
what
a
contrast
rosalie
looked
to
the
rest
of
the
caravan
the
shabby
furniture
the
thin
wasted
mother
the
dirty
torn
little
frock
she
had
just
laid
aside
were
quite
out
of
keeping
with
the
pretty
little
figure
which
stood
by
the
bed
at
length
her
father
voice
called
her
and
after
giving
her
mother
a
last
kiss
and
placing
some
water
near
her
on
the
box
in
case
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
should
come
on
rosalie
ran
quickly
down
the
caravan
steps
and
rushed
into
the
theatre
a
crowd
of
people
stared
at
her
as
she
flitted
past
and
disappeared
up
the
theatre
steps
the
audience
had
not
yet
been
admitted
so
rosalie
crept
into
the
room
behind
the
stage
in
which
her
father
company
was
assembled
they
all
looked
tired
and
cross
for
this
was
the
last
night
of
the
fair
and
they
had
had
little
sleep
whilst
it
lasted
at
length
augustus
announced
that
it
was
time
to
begin
and
they
all
went
out
upon
a
platform
which
was
erected
half
way
up
the
outside
of
the
theatre
just
underneath
the
three
rows
of
illuminated
stars
here
they
danced
and
sang
and
shook
tambourines
in
order
to
beguile
the
people
to
enter
then
they
disappeared
within
and
a
crowd
of
eager
spectators
immediately
rushed
up
the
steps
paid
their
admission
money
and
took
their
seats
in
the
theatre
after
this
the
play
commenced
augustus
acting
as
manager
and
keeping
his
company
up
to
their
various
parts
it
was
a
foolish
play
and
in
some
of
the
parts
there
was
a
strong
mixture
of
very
objectionable
language
yet
it
was
highly
appreciated
by
the
audience
and
met
with
vociferous
applause
there
were
many
young
girls
there
some
of
them
servants
in
respectable
families
where
they
enjoyed
every
comfort
yet
they
looked
up
at
little
rosalie
with
eyes
of
admiration
and
envy
they
thought
her
life
was
much
happier
than
theirs
and
that
her
lot
was
greatly
to
be
desired
they
looked
at
the
white
dress
and
the
pink
roses
and
contrasted
them
with
their
own
warm
but
homely
garments
they
watched
the
pretty
girl
going
through
her
part
gracefully
and
easily
and
they
contrasted
her
work
with
theirs
how
interesting
how
delightful
they
thought
to
be
doing
this
instead
of
scrubbing
floors
or
washing
clothes
or
nursing
children
but
they
knew
nothing
of
the
life
behind
the
scenes
of
the
sick
mother
the
wretched
home
the
poor
and
insufficient
food
the
dirty
ragged
frock
they
knew
nothing
of
the
bitter
tears
which
had
just
been
wiped
away
nor
of
the
weary
aching
of
the
little
feet
which
were
dancing
so
lightly
over
the
stage
and
those
little
feet
became
more
and
more
weary
as
the
night
went
on
as
soon
as
the
play
was
over
the
people
rushed
out
into
the
fair
to
seek
for
fresh
amusement
but
the
actors
had
no
rest
once
more
they
appeared
on
the
platform
to
attract
a
fresh
audience
and
then
the
same
play
was
repeated
the
same
songs
were
sung
the
same
words
were
said
fresh
to
the
people
who
were
listening
but
oh
how
stale
and
monotonous
to
the
actors
themselves
and
so
it
went
on
all
night
as
soon
as
one
exhibition
was
over
another
began
and
the
theatre
was
filled
and
refilled
long
after
the
clock
of
the
neighbouring
church
had
struck
the
hour
of
twelve
at
last
it
was
over
the
last
audience
had
left
the
brilliant
stars
disappeared
and
rosalie
was
at
liberty
to
creep
back
to
her
mother
so
weary
and
exhausted
was
she
that
she
could
hardly
drag
herself
up
the
caravan
steps
she
opened
the
door
very
gently
that
she
might
not
disturb
her
mother
and
then
she
tried
to
undress
herself
but
she
was
aching
in
every
limb
and
sitting
down
on
the
box
beside
her
mother
bed
she
fell
asleep
her
little
weary
head
resting
on
her
mother
pillow
poor
little
woman
she
ought
to
have
been
laid
in
a
quiet
little
nest
hours
ago
instead
of
being
exposed
to
the
close
hot
stifling
air
of
the
theatre
through
all
the
long
hours
of
a
weary
night
in
about
an
hour
time
her
mother
woke
and
found
her
little
girl
sleeping
in
her
uncomfortable
position
her
white
dress
unfastened
and
the
pink
roses
from
her
hair
fallen
on
the
ground
weak
as
she
was
the
poor
mother
dragged
herself
out
of
bed
to
help
her
tired
child
to
undress
dear
she
said
tenderly
up
but
for
some
time
rosalie
did
not
stir
and
when
her
mother
touched
her
she
sat
up
and
said
as
if
in
her
sleep
rejoice
with
me
for
i
have
found
my
sheep
which
was
lost
is
dreaming
of
her
picture
poor
child
said
the
mother
to
herself
then
rosalie
woke
and
shivered
as
she
felt
the
cold
night
air
on
her
bare
neck
and
arms
very
gently
the
poor
weak
mother
helped
her
to
take
off
her
white
dress
and
her
small
ragged
petticoats
and
then
the
child
crept
into
bed
and
into
her
mother
arms
little
tired
lamb
said
the
mother
as
the
weary
child
nestled
up
to
her
i
the
lamb
said
rosalie
in
a
sleepy
voice
the
mother
did
not
answer
but
kissed
her
child
passionately
and
then
lay
awake
by
her
side
weeping
and
coughing
by
turns
till
the
morning
dawned
chapter
iii
the
day
after
the
fair
the
next
morning
rosalie
was
waked
by
a
rap
at
the
caravan
door
she
crept
out
of
bed
and
putting
her
dress
over
her
shoulders
peeped
out
between
the
muslin
curtains
toby
mammie
she
said
see
what
he
wants
she
opened
the
door
a
crack
and
toby
put
his
mouth
to
it
and
whispered
rosie
we
going
to
start
in
about
half
an
hour
master
has
just
sent
me
for
the
horses
we
been
up
all
night
packing
three
of
the
waggons
is
loaded
and
they
only
some
of
the
scenery
to
roll
up
and
then
we
shall
start
are
we
going
toby
asked
the
child
a
town
a
long
way
off
said
toby
never
been
there
before
master
says
and
it
will
take
us
nearly
a
week
to
get
there
but
i
must
be
off
miss
rosie
or
master
will
be
coming
you
tired
toby
said
the
child
kindly
toby
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
with
a
broad
grin
wonder
if
any
one
in
this
concern
is
ever
anything
else
but
tired
then
he
walked
away
into
the
town
for
the
horses
which
had
been
put
up
in
the
stables
of
an
inn
and
rosalie
returned
to
her
mother
there
were
several
things
to
be
done
before
they
could
start
the
crockery
had
all
to
be
taken
from
the
shelf
and
stowed
away
in
a
safe
place
lest
the
jolting
over
the
rough
and
uneven
field
should
throw
it
down
besides
this
rosalie
had
to
dress
herself
and
get
her
mother
breakfast
ready
that
she
might
eat
it
in
peace
before
the
shaking
of
the
caravan
commenced
when
all
was
ready
rosalie
stood
at
the
window
and
looked
out
the
fair
looked
very
different
from
what
it
had
done
the
night
before
most
of
the
had
been
up
all
night
taking
their
shows
to
pieces
and
packing
everything
up
though
it
was
not
yet
nine
many
of
them
had
already
started
and
the
field
was
half
empty
it
was
a
dreary
scene
of
desolation
all
the
little
grass
it
had
once
possessed
which
had
given
it
a
right
to
the
name
of
field
had
entirely
disappeared
and
the
bare
uneven
ground
was
thickly
strewn
with
dirty
pieces
of
paper
broken
boxes
and
old
rags
which
had
been
left
behind
by
the
besides
a
quantity
of
and
and
oyster
shells
which
had
been
thrown
into
the
mud
the
night
before
very
dirty
and
untidy
and
forlorn
it
looked
as
rosalie
gazed
at
it
from
the
door
of
the
caravan
then
a
waggon
jolted
past
laden
with
the
largest
of
the
numerous
whirligigs
the
wooden
horses
and
elephants
peeping
out
from
the
waterproof
covering
which
had
been
thrown
over
them
then
a
large
swing
passed
by
then
the
show
of
the
giant
and
dwarf
these
were
followed
by
a
establishment
and
the
marionettes
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
the
show
of
the
blue
horse
and
the
performing
seal
set
out
on
its
way
to
the
next
feast
accompanied
by
the
shows
of
the
fat
boy
and
of
the
lady
without
arms
who
performed
wonders
with
her
toes
in
the
ways
of
and
other
household
business
and
whose
very
infirmities
and
deformities
were
thus
made
into
gain
and
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
curious
crowds
by
her
own
relations
all
these
rattled
past
and
rosalie
watched
them
out
of
sight
then
toby
returned
with
the
horses
they
were
yoked
to
the
waggons
and
to
the
caravans
and
the
little
cavalcade
set
forth
the
jolting
over
the
rough
ground
was
very
great
and
much
tried
the
poor
sick
woman
who
was
shaken
from
side
to
side
of
her
wretched
bed
then
outside
the
field
they
had
to
wait
a
long
time
for
the
road
was
completely
filled
by
the
numerous
caravans
of
the
show
and
no
one
could
pass
until
they
were
gone
the
elephants
were
standing
close
to
the
pavement
now
and
again
twisting
their
long
trunks
into
the
trees
of
the
small
gardens
in
front
of
the
neighbouring
houses
and
they
would
undoubtedly
have
broken
the
branches
to
atoms
had
not
their
keeper
driven
them
off
with
his
whip
a
crowd
of
children
was
gathered
round
them
feeding
them
with
bread
and
biscuit
and
enjoying
the
delay
of
the
show
but
augustus
became
very
impatient
for
he
had
a
long
journey
before
him
so
after
pacing
up
and
down
and
chafing
against
the
stoppage
for
some
time
he
went
up
to
the
manager
of
the
show
and
addressed
him
in
such
violent
and
passionate
language
that
a
policeman
was
obliged
to
interfere
and
desired
him
to
keep
the
peace
at
length
the
huge
yellow
caravans
each
drawn
by
six
strong
moved
slowly
on
led
by
a
procession
of
elephants
and
camels
and
followed
by
a
large
crowd
of
children
who
accompanied
them
to
the
outskirts
of
the
town
here
by
turning
down
a
the
theatre
party
was
able
to
pass
them
and
thus
get
the
start
of
them
on
their
journey
rosalie
was
glad
to
leave
the
town
and
feel
the
fresh
country
air
blowing
upon
her
face
it
was
so
very
refreshing
after
the
close
stagnant
air
of
the
fair
she
opened
the
upper
part
of
the
door
and
stood
looking
out
watching
toby
who
was
driving
and
talking
to
him
from
time
to
time
of
the
objects
which
they
passed
by
the
way
it
was
a
new
road
to
rosalie
and
to
her
mother
at
length
about
twelve
they
came
to
a
little
village
where
they
halted
for
a
short
time
that
the
horses
might
rest
before
going
farther
the
country
children
were
just
leaving
the
village
school
and
they
gathered
round
the
caravans
with
open
eyes
and
mouths
staring
curiously
at
the
smoke
coming
from
the
small
chimneys
and
at
rosalie
who
was
peeping
out
from
between
the
muslin
curtains
but
after
satisfying
their
curiosity
they
moved
away
in
little
groups
to
their
various
homes
that
they
might
be
in
time
to
get
their
dinner
done
before
afternoon
school
then
the
village
street
was
quite
quiet
and
rosalie
stood
at
the
door
watching
the
birds
hopping
from
tree
to
tree
and
the
bees
gathering
honey
from
the
flowers
in
the
gardens
her
mother
was
better
and
was
dressing
herself
slowly
for
she
thought
that
a
breath
of
country
air
might
revive
and
strengthen
her
augustus
toby
and
the
other
men
of
the
company
had
gone
into
the
small
inn
for
refreshment
and
toby
was
sent
back
to
the
caravan
with
large
slices
of
bread
and
cheese
for
rosalie
and
her
mother
the
child
ate
of
it
eagerly
the
fresh
air
had
given
her
an
appetite
but
the
poor
woman
could
not
touch
it
as
soon
as
she
was
dressed
she
crept
with
rosalie
help
to
the
door
of
the
caravan
and
sat
on
the
top
step
leaning
against
one
of
the
boxes
which
the
child
dragged
from
its
place
to
make
a
support
for
her
the
caravan
was
drawn
up
by
the
side
of
a
small
cottage
with
a
thatched
roof
there
was
a
little
garden
in
front
of
it
filled
with
sweet
flowers
large
southernwood
rosemary
sweetbriar
and
lavender
as
the
wind
blew
softly
over
them
it
wafted
their
sweet
fragrance
to
the
sick
woman
sitting
on
the
caravan
steps
the
quiet
stillness
of
the
country
was
very
refreshing
and
soothing
to
her
after
the
turmoil
and
din
of
the
last
week
no
sound
was
to
be
heard
but
the
singing
of
the
larks
overhead
the
humming
of
the
bees
and
the
gentle
rustling
of
the
breeze
amongst
the
branches
then
the
cottage
door
opened
and
a
little
child
about
three
years
old
ran
out
with
a
ball
in
his
hand
which
he
rolled
down
the
path
leading
to
the
garden
gate
a
minute
afterwards
a
young
woman
in
a
clean
cotton
gown
and
white
apron
brought
her
work
outside
and
sitting
on
the
seat
near
the
cottage
door
watched
her
child
at
play
with
a
mother
love
and
tenderness
she
was
knitting
a
little
red
sock
for
one
of
those
tiny
feet
to
wear
click
click
click
went
her
but
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
child
ready
to
run
to
him
at
the
first
alarm
to
pick
him
up
if
he
should
fall
or
to
soothe
him
if
he
should
be
in
trouble
now
and
then
she
glanced
at
the
caravan
standing
at
her
garden
gate
and
gave
a
look
of
compassion
at
the
poor
thin
woman
whose
cough
from
time
to
time
was
so
distressing
then
as
was
her
custom
she
began
to
sing
as
she
worked
she
had
a
clear
sweet
voice
and
the
sick
woman
and
her
child
listened
the
words
of
her
song
were
these
i
thy
face
am
seeking
early
will
i
turn
to
thee
words
of
love
thy
voice
is
speaking
come
come
to
me
come
to
me
when
life
is
dawning
i
thy
dearest
friend
would
be
in
the
sunshine
of
the
morning
come
come
to
me
come
to
me
oh
do
believe
me
i
have
shed
my
blood
for
thee
i
am
waiting
to
receive
thee
come
come
to
me
i
come
without
delaying
to
thine
arms
at
once
i
flee
lest
no
more
i
hear
thee
saying
come
come
to
me
when
she
had
finished
singing
all
was
quite
still
again
there
was
hardly
a
sound
except
the
pattering
of
the
little
feet
on
the
garden
path
but
presently
the
child
began
to
cry
and
the
careful
mother
flew
to
his
side
to
discover
what
had
pained
him
it
was
only
the
loss
of
his
ball
which
he
had
thrown
too
high
and
which
had
gone
over
the
hedge
and
seemed
to
him
lost
for
ever
only
his
ball
and
yet
that
ball
was
as
much
to
that
tiny
mind
as
our
most
precious
treasures
are
to
us
the
mother
knew
this
so
she
calmed
the
child
fears
and
ran
immediately
to
recover
his
lost
plaything
but
rosalie
was
before
her
she
had
seen
the
ball
come
over
the
hedge
and
had
heard
the
child
cry
and
when
his
mother
appeared
at
the
gate
she
saw
the
child
of
the
caravan
returning
from
her
chase
after
the
ball
which
had
rolled
some
way
down
the
hilly
road
she
brought
it
to
the
young
mother
who
thanked
her
for
her
kindness
and
then
gazed
lovingly
and
pityingly
into
her
face
she
was
a
mother
and
she
thought
of
the
happy
life
her
child
led
compared
with
that
of
this
poor
little
wanderer
with
this
feeling
in
her
heart
after
restoring
the
ball
to
the
once
more
contented
child
she
ran
into
the
house
and
returned
with
a
mug
of
new
milk
and
a
slice
of
bread
spread
with
fresh
country
butter
which
she
handed
to
rosalie
and
begged
her
to
eat
you
said
little
rosalie
please
may
mammie
have
it
i
had
some
bread
and
cheese
but
she
is
too
ill
to
eat
that
and
this
would
do
her
such
good
to
be
sure
said
the
countrywoman
her
that
child
and
i
fetch
some
more
for
you
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
rosalie
and
her
mother
had
quite
a
little
picnic
on
the
steps
of
the
caravan
with
the
young
woman
standing
by
and
talking
to
them
as
they
ate
and
now
and
then
looking
over
the
hedge
into
the
garden
that
she
might
see
if
any
trouble
had
come
to
her
boy
liked
to
hear
you
sing
said
rosalie
mother
you
said
the
young
woman
i
often
sing
when
i
knitting
my
little
one
likes
to
hear
me
and
he
almost
knows
that
hymn
now
often
when
he
is
at
play
i
hear
him
singing
tome
tome
to
me
so
prettily
the
little
dear
she
said
with
tears
in
her
eyes
wish
i
knew
it
said
rosalie
tell
you
what
said
the
young
woman
give
you
a
card
with
it
on
our
clergyman
had
it
printed
and
we
got
two
of
them
she
ran
again
into
the
house
and
returned
with
a
card
on
which
the
hymn
was
printed
in
clear
distinct
type
there
were
two
holes
pierced
through
the
top
of
the
card
and
a
piece
of
blue
ribbon
had
been
slipped
through
and
tied
in
a
bow
at
the
top
rosalie
seized
it
eagerly
and
began
reading
it
at
once
got
such
a
good
clergyman
here
said
the
young
woman
has
not
been
here
more
than
a
few
months
and
he
has
done
so
many
nice
things
for
us
leslie
reads
aloud
in
one
of
the
cottages
once
a
week
and
we
all
take
our
work
and
go
to
listen
to
her
and
she
talks
to
us
so
beautiful
out
of
the
bible
it
always
does
me
good
to
go
she
stopped
suddenly
as
she
saw
rosalie
mother
face
she
had
turned
deadly
pale
and
was
leaning
back
against
the
box
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
her
the
matter
said
the
little
woman
afraid
you
turned
faint
and
how
you
do
tremble
let
me
help
you
in
better
lie
on
your
bed
had
you
she
gave
her
her
arm
and
she
and
rosalie
took
her
inside
the
caravan
and
laid
her
on
her
bed
but
she
was
obliged
to
leave
her
in
a
minute
or
two
as
her
little
boy
was
climbing
on
the
gate
and
she
was
afraid
he
would
fall
a
few
minutes
afterwards
a
great
noise
was
heard
in
the
distance
and
a
number
of
the
village
children
appeared
running
in
front
of
the
show
which
was
just
passing
through
the
young
woman
took
her
little
boy
in
her
arms
and
held
him
up
that
he
might
see
the
elephants
and
camels
which
were
marching
with
stately
dignity
in
front
of
the
yellow
vans
when
they
had
gone
toby
appeared
with
the
horse
and
said
his
master
had
told
him
he
was
to
start
and
he
would
follow
presently
with
the
rest
of
the
waggons
the
horse
was
soon
put
in
the
caravan
and
they
were
just
starting
when
the
young
woman
gathered
a
nosegay
of
the
lovely
flowers
in
her
garden
and
handed
them
to
rosalie
saying
them
and
put
them
in
water
for
your
mother
the
sight
of
them
maybe
will
do
her
good
learn
the
hymn
wo
you
and
god
bless
you
she
watched
them
out
of
sight
standing
at
her
cottage
door
with
her
child
in
her
arms
whilst
rosalie
leaned
out
of
the
window
to
nod
to
her
and
smile
at
her
then
they
turned
a
corner
and
came
into
the
main
street
of
the
village
you
see
the
church
rosalie
asked
her
mother
hurriedly
mammie
dear
said
rosalie
just
at
the
end
of
this
street
such
a
pretty
church
with
trees
all
round
it
there
any
houses
near
it
asked
her
mother
one
mammie
dear
a
big
house
in
a
garden
but
i
ca
see
it
very
well
there
are
so
many
trees
in
front
of
it
toby
to
put
you
down
rosalie
and
run
and
have
a
look
at
it
as
we
pass
so
rosalie
was
lifted
down
from
the
caravan
and
ran
up
to
the
vicarage
gate
whilst
her
mother
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
to
see
as
much
as
she
could
through
the
open
window
but
she
could
only
see
the
spire
of
the
church
and
the
chimneys
of
the
house
and
she
was
too
exhausted
to
get
up
presently
rosalie
overtook
them
panting
with
her
running
toby
never
dared
to
wait
for
her
lest
his
master
should
find
fault
with
him
for
stopping
but
rosalie
often
got
down
from
the
caravan
to
gather
wild
flowers
or
to
drink
at
a
wayside
spring
and
as
she
was
very
fleet
of
foot
she
was
always
able
to
overtake
them
was
it
like
rosalie
asked
her
mother
when
she
was
seated
on
the
box
beside
her
bed
ever
so
pretty
mammie
dear
such
soft
grass
and
such
lovely
roses
and
a
broad
gravel
walk
all
up
to
the
door
and
in
the
garden
there
was
a
lady
such
a
pretty
lady
and
she
and
her
little
girl
were
gathering
some
of
the
flowers
they
see
you
rosalie
the
little
girl
saw
me
mammie
peeping
through
the
gate
and
she
said
who
is
that
little
girl
mamma
i
never
saw
her
before
and
then
her
mamma
looked
up
and
smiled
at
me
and
she
was
just
coming
to
speak
to
me
when
i
turned
frightened
and
i
saw
the
caravan
had
gone
out
of
sight
so
i
ran
away
and
i
been
running
ever
since
to
get
up
to
you
the
mother
listened
to
her
child
account
with
a
pale
and
restless
face
then
she
lay
back
on
her
pillow
and
sighed
several
times
at
last
they
heard
a
rumbling
sound
behind
them
and
toby
announced
master
he
soon
overtaken
us
said
her
mother
anxiously
you
ever
tell
your
father
about
that
house
or
that
i
told
you
to
go
and
look
at
it
or
about
what
that
young
woman
said
mind
you
never
say
a
word
to
him
about
it
promise
me
rosalie
not
mammie
dear
asked
rosalie
with
a
very
perplexed
face
mind
why
rosalie
said
her
mother
fretfully
do
wish
it
well
mammie
dear
said
rosalie
tell
you
some
time
rosalie
said
her
mother
gently
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
though
oh
no
i
ca
tell
it
rosalie
wondered
very
much
what
her
mother
meant
and
she
sat
watching
her
pale
sorrowful
face
as
she
lay
on
her
bed
with
her
eyes
closed
what
was
she
thinking
of
what
was
it
she
had
to
tell
her
for
some
time
rosalie
sat
quite
still
musing
on
what
her
mother
had
said
and
then
she
pinned
the
card
on
the
wall
just
over
her
dear
picture
and
once
more
read
the
words
of
the
hymn
after
this
she
arranged
the
flowers
in
a
small
glass
and
put
them
on
the
box
near
her
mother
bed
the
and
and
southernwood
filled
the
caravan
with
their
fragrance
then
rosalie
took
up
her
usual
position
at
the
door
to
watch
toby
driving
and
to
see
all
that
was
to
be
seen
by
the
way
they
passed
through
several
other
villages
and
saw
many
lone
farmhouses
and
solitary
cottages
when
night
came
they
drew
up
on
the
outskirts
of
a
small
toby
took
the
horses
to
an
inn
and
they
rested
there
for
the
night
chapter
iv
the
actress
story
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
it
was
light
the
horses
were
put
in
again
and
the
theatre
party
proceeded
on
their
way
rosalie
mother
seemed
much
better
the
country
air
and
country
quiet
had
for
a
time
restored
to
her
much
of
her
former
strength
she
was
able
with
rosalie
help
to
dress
herself
and
to
sit
on
one
of
the
boxes
beside
her
bed
resting
her
head
against
the
pillows
and
gazing
out
at
the
green
fields
and
clear
blue
sky
the
sweet
fresh
breezes
came
in
at
the
open
door
and
fanned
her
careworn
face
and
the
face
of
the
child
who
sat
beside
her
said
her
mother
suddenly
you
like
to
hear
about
the
time
when
your
mother
was
a
little
girl
mammie
dear
said
rosalie
nestling
up
to
her
side
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
rosalie
said
her
mother
the
beginning
of
a
very
sad
story
and
i
did
not
like
my
little
girl
to
know
about
it
but
i
sometimes
think
i
be
long
with
you
and
i
had
rather
tell
it
to
you
myself
than
have
any
one
else
tell
it
and
you
getting
a
great
girl
now
rosalie
you
will
be
able
to
understand
many
things
you
could
not
have
understood
before
and
there
have
been
things
the
last
few
days
which
have
brought
it
all
back
to
me
and
made
me
think
of
it
by
day
and
dream
of
it
by
night
tell
me
mammie
dear
said
rosalie
as
her
mother
stopped
speaking
you
like
to
hear
it
now
said
the
poor
woman
with
a
sigh
as
if
she
hardly
liked
to
begin
mammie
dear
said
rosalie
draw
closer
to
me
child
for
i
do
want
toby
to
hear
and
mind
you
must
never
speak
of
what
i
going
to
tell
you
before
your
father
promise
me
rosalie
she
said
earnestly
never
mammie
dear
said
little
rosalie
then
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
no
sound
to
be
heard
but
the
cracking
of
toby
whip
and
the
rumbling
of
the
waggons
behind
you
going
to
begin
mammie
said
rosalie
at
length
almost
wish
i
had
promised
to
tell
you
child
said
her
mother
hurriedly
cuts
me
up
so
to
think
of
it
but
never
mind
you
ought
to
know
and
you
will
know
some
day
so
i
had
better
tell
you
myself
rosalie
your
mother
was
born
a
lady
said
the
poor
woman
as
the
child
did
not
speak
was
never
born
to
this
life
of
misery
i
brought
myself
to
it
i
chose
it
she
said
bitterly
i
only
getting
the
harvest
of
what
i
sowed
myself
when
she
had
said
this
she
turned
deadly
pale
and
shivered
from
head
to
foot
rosalie
crept
still
closer
to
her
and
put
her
little
warm
hand
in
her
mother
cold
one
then
the
poor
woman
by
a
strong
effort
controlled
herself
and
she
went
on
now
darling
i
tell
you
all
about
it
just
as
if
i
was
talking
about
some
one
else
i
forget
it
is
myself
or
i
shall
never
be
able
to
tell
it
i
try
and
fancy
i
on
the
stage
and
talking
about
the
sorrows
and
troubles
of
some
one
i
never
knew
and
never
cared
for
and
of
whom
i
shall
never
think
again
when
my
part
is
over
was
born
in
a
country
village
hundreds
of
miles
from
here
in
the
south
of
england
my
father
was
the
squire
of
the
place
we
lived
in
a
large
mansion
which
was
built
half
way
up
the
side
of
a
wooded
hill
and
an
avenue
of
beautiful
old
trees
led
up
to
the
house
there
was
a
large
conservatory
at
one
side
of
it
filled
with
the
rarest
flowers
and
in
a
shady
corner
of
the
grounds
my
mother
had
a
kind
of
grotto
filled
with
lovely
ferns
through
which
a
clear
stream
of
water
was
ever
flowing
this
fernery
was
my
mother
great
delight
and
here
she
spent
much
of
her
time
she
was
a
very
worldly
woman
she
took
very
little
notice
of
her
children
and
when
she
was
not
in
the
garden
she
was
generally
lying
on
the
sofa
in
the
reading
novels
which
she
procured
from
a
london
library
father
was
a
very
different
man
he
was
fond
of
quiet
and
fond
of
his
children
but
he
was
obliged
to
be
often
from
home
so
that
we
did
not
see
as
much
of
him
as
we
should
otherwise
have
done
had
one
brother
and
one
sister
my
brother
was
much
older
than
we
were
there
had
been
several
children
between
us
who
had
died
in
their
infancy
so
that
he
was
in
the
sixth
form
of
a
large
public
school
whilst
we
were
children
in
the
nursery
sister
lucy
was
a
year
younger
than
i
was
she
was
such
a
pretty
child
and
had
a
very
sweet
disposition
when
we
were
children
we
got
on
very
well
together
and
shared
every
pleasure
and
every
grief
my
father
bought
us
a
little
white
pony
and
on
this
we
used
to
ride
in
turns
about
the
park
when
we
were
quite
small
children
our
old
nurse
following
to
see
that
no
harm
came
to
us
was
a
very
good
old
woman
she
taught
us
to
say
our
prayers
night
and
morning
and
on
sundays
she
used
to
sit
with
us
under
a
tree
in
the
park
and
show
us
scripture
pictures
and
tell
us
stories
out
of
the
bible
there
was
one
picture
of
a
shepherd
very
like
that
rosalie
it
came
back
to
my
mind
the
other
day
when
that
old
man
gave
it
to
you
only
in
mine
the
shepherd
was
just
drawing
the
lamb
out
of
a
deep
miry
pit
into
which
it
had
fallen
and
the
text
underneath
it
was
this
the
son
of
man
is
come
to
seek
and
to
save
that
which
is
lost
we
used
to
learn
these
texts
and
repeat
them
to
our
nurse
when
we
looked
at
the
pictures
and
then
if
we
had
said
them
correctly
she
used
to
let
us
carry
our
tea
into
the
park
and
eat
it
under
the
tree
and
after
tea
we
used
to
sing
one
of
our
little
hymns
and
say
our
prayers
and
then
she
took
us
in
and
put
us
to
bed
i
have
often
thought
of
those
quiet
happy
sundays
when
i
have
been
listening
to
the
noise
and
racket
of
the
fair
thought
a
great
deal
at
the
time
about
what
our
nurse
told
us
i
remember
one
sunday
she
had
been
reading
to
us
about
the
judgment
day
and
how
god
would
read
out
of
a
book
all
the
wrong
things
we
had
done
and
that
same
afternoon
there
was
a
great
thunderstorm
the
lightning
flashed
in
at
the
window
and
the
thunder
rolled
overhead
it
made
me
think
of
what
nurse
had
said
and
of
the
judgment
day
and
then
i
knelt
down
and
prayed
that
god
would
take
care
of
me
and
not
let
the
lightning
kill
me
i
crept
behind
the
sofa
in
the
large
and
trembled
lest
the
books
should
be
opened
and
all
my
sins
read
out
and
i
asked
god
to
keep
them
shut
a
little
longer
i
remember
another
day
when
i
had
told
a
lie
but
would
not
own
that
i
had
done
so
nurse
would
not
let
me
sleep
with
lucy
but
moved
my
little
bed
into
her
room
that
i
might
lie
still
and
think
about
my
sin
it
was
a
strange
room
and
i
could
not
sleep
for
some
time
but
i
lay
awake
with
my
eyes
closed
when
i
opened
them
i
saw
one
bright
star
shining
in
at
the
closed
window
it
seemed
to
me
like
the
eye
of
god
watching
me
i
could
not
get
the
thought
out
of
my
mind
i
shut
my
eyes
tightly
that
i
might
not
see
it
but
i
could
not
help
opening
them
to
see
if
it
was
still
there
and
when
nurse
came
up
to
bed
she
found
me
weeping
i
have
often
seen
that
star
since
rosalie
looking
in
at
the
window
of
the
caravan
and
it
always
reminds
me
of
that
night
and
makes
me
think
of
that
eye
had
a
very
strong
will
rosalie
and
even
as
a
child
i
hated
to
be
controlled
if
i
set
my
heart
upon
anything
i
wanted
to
have
it
at
once
and
if
i
was
opposed
i
was
very
angry
i
loved
my
dear
old
nurse
but
when
we
were
about
eight
years
old
she
had
to
leave
us
to
live
with
her
mother
and
then
i
was
completely
unmanageable
my
mother
engaged
a
governess
for
us
who
was
to
teach
us
in
a
morning
and
take
us
out
in
the
afternoon
she
was
an
indolent
person
and
she
took
very
little
trouble
with
us
and
my
mother
did
not
exert
herself
sufficiently
to
look
after
us
or
to
see
what
we
were
doing
thus
we
learnt
very
little
and
got
into
idle
and
careless
habits
our
governess
used
to
sit
down
in
the
park
with
a
book
and
we
were
allowed
to
follow
our
own
devices
and
amuse
ourselves
as
we
pleased
my
brother
gerald
came
home
it
was
always
a
great
cause
of
excitement
to
us
we
used
to
meet
him
at
the
station
and
drive
him
home
in
triumph
then
we
always
had
holidays
and
miss
manders
went
away
and
gerald
used
to
amuse
us
with
stories
of
his
school
friends
as
we
walked
with
him
through
the
park
he
was
a
very
lad
and
my
mother
was
very
proud
of
him
she
thought
much
more
of
him
than
of
us
because
he
was
a
boy
and
was
to
be
the
heir
to
the
property
she
liked
to
drive
out
with
her
handsome
son
who
was
admired
by
every
one
who
saw
him
and
sometimes
we
were
allowed
to
go
with
them
we
were
generally
left
outside
in
the
carriage
whilst
mamma
and
gerald
called
at
the
large
houses
of
the
neighbourhood
and
we
used
to
jump
out
as
soon
as
they
had
disappeared
inside
the
house
and
explore
the
different
gardens
and
plan
how
we
would
lay
out
our
grounds
when
we
had
houses
of
our
own
but
what
that
rosalie
did
the
waggons
stop
rosalie
ran
to
the
door
and
looked
out
mammie
she
said
father
coming
mind
not
a
word
said
her
mother
in
a
hoarse
whisper
said
augustus
entering
the
caravan
in
a
theatrical
manner
thought
i
might
as
well
enjoy
the
felicity
of
the
amiable
society
of
my
lady
and
her
daughter
this
was
said
with
a
profound
bow
towards
his
wife
and
rosalie
to
see
you
so
much
better
madam
he
continued
singular
is
it
that
your
health
and
spirits
have
revived
immediately
we
have
left
the
inspired
scene
of
public
action
or
to
speak
in
plain
terms
when
there
no
work
to
do
think
it
the
fresh
air
augustus
that
has
done
me
good
there
was
such
a
close
stifling
smell
from
the
fair
i
felt
worse
directly
we
got
there
to
be
hoped
he
said
with
a
disagreeable
smile
on
his
face
this
resuscitation
of
the
vital
powers
may
be
continued
until
we
arrive
at
lesborough
but
the
probability
is
that
the
moment
we
arrive
on
the
scene
of
action
you
will
be
seized
with
that
most
unpleasant
of
all
maladies
distaste
to
your
work
and
will
be
compelled
once
more
to
resume
that
most
interesting
and
pathetic
occupation
of
playing
the
invalid
augustus
do
speak
to
me
like
that
said
the
poor
wife
augustus
made
no
answer
but
taking
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
twisted
it
up
and
putting
it
into
the
fire
lighted
a
long
pipe
and
began
to
smoke
the
fumes
of
the
tobacco
brought
on
his
poor
wife
cough
but
he
took
very
little
notice
of
her
except
to
ask
her
occasionally
between
the
whiffs
of
his
pipe
how
long
that
melodious
sound
was
to
last
then
his
eyes
fell
upon
rosalie
picture
which
was
pinned
to
the
side
of
the
caravan
did
you
get
that
from
he
inquired
turning
to
his
wife
mine
father
said
little
rosalie
old
gentleman
in
the
fair
gave
it
to
me
is
it
pretty
it
will
do
for
a
child
he
said
scornfully
what
are
you
after
you
creeping
along
we
shall
never
get
there
at
this
pace
horse
is
tired
master
said
toby
had
a
long
stretch
these
two
days
him
then
said
the
cruel
man
him
well
do
you
think
i
can
afford
to
waste
time
upon
the
road
the
wild
beasts
are
a
mile
ahead
at
the
very
least
and
the
marionettes
will
be
there
by
this
time
we
shall
just
arrive
when
all
the
people
have
spent
their
money
and
are
tired
out
now
there
was
one
subject
of
standing
dispute
between
toby
and
his
master
toby
was
a
lad
and
hated
to
see
the
horses
and
badly
used
he
was
always
remonstrating
with
his
master
about
it
and
thereby
bringing
down
upon
himself
his
master
wrath
and
abuse
augustus
cared
nothing
for
the
comfort
or
welfare
of
those
under
him
to
get
as
much
work
as
possible
out
of
them
and
to
make
as
much
gain
by
them
as
he
could
was
all
he
thought
of
they
might
be
tired
or
hungry
or
overburdened
what
did
it
matter
to
him
so
long
as
the
end
for
which
he
kept
them
was
fulfilled
the
same
spirit
which
led
him
to
treat
his
company
and
his
wife
with
severity
and
indifference
led
him
to
his
horses
toby
resolutely
refused
to
beat
the
poor
tired
horse
which
was
already
straining
itself
to
its
utmost
the
additional
weight
of
augustus
having
been
very
trying
to
it
the
last
few
miles
when
augustus
saw
that
toby
did
not
mean
to
obey
him
he
sprang
to
the
door
of
the
caravan
in
a
towering
passion
seized
the
whip
from
toby
hand
and
then
beat
the
poor
horse
unmercifully
causing
it
to
start
from
side
to
side
till
nearly
everything
in
the
caravan
was
thrown
to
the
ground
and
rosalie
and
her
mother
trembled
with
suppressed
indignation
and
horror
then
with
one
last
tremendous
blow
aimed
at
toby
head
augustus
threw
down
the
whip
and
returned
to
his
pipe

the
sisters
chapter
v
rosalie
first
sermon
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
they
had
started
on
their
journey
rosalie
begged
her
mother
to
continue
her
story
so
after
satisfying
herself
that
her
husband
did
not
intend
to
favour
them
with
his
company
the
poor
woman
took
up
the
thread
of
her
story
at
the
place
at
which
she
had
left
it
when
they
were
interrupted
the
day
before
was
telling
you
dear
about
my
life
in
that
quiet
country
i
think
i
can
remember
nothing
worth
mentioning
until
an
event
happened
which
altered
the
whole
course
of
our
lives
and
i
had
been
out
riding
in
the
park
on
the
beautiful
new
horses
which
our
father
had
given
us
a
few
months
before
and
we
had
had
a
very
pleasant
afternoon
i
can
see
lucy
now
in
her
her
fair
hair
hanging
down
her
back
and
her
cheeks
glowing
with
the
air
and
exercise
she
was
very
pretty
was
my
sister
lucy
people
said
i
was
handsomer
than
she
was
and
had
a
better
figure
and
brighter
eyes
but
lucy
was
a
little
thing
and
no
one
could
look
at
her
without
loving
her
got
down
from
our
horses
leaving
them
with
the
groom
who
had
been
riding
out
with
us
and
ran
into
the
house
but
we
were
met
by
one
of
the
servants
with
a
face
white
with
alarm
who
begged
us
to
go
quietly
upstairs
as
our
father
was
very
ill
and
the
doctor
said
he
was
to
be
perfectly
quiet
we
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
with
him
and
she
told
us
that
as
he
had
been
riding
home
from
the
railway
station
his
horse
which
was
a
young
one
he
had
just
bought
had
thrown
him
and
that
he
had
been
brought
home
insensible
more
than
this
she
could
not
tell
us
but
our
mother
came
into
our
bedroom
and
told
us
with
more
feeling
than
i
had
ever
seen
in
her
face
before
that
our
father
could
not
live
through
the
night
shall
never
forget
that
night
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
been
brought
close
to
death
and
it
frightened
me
i
lay
awake
listening
to
the
hall
clock
as
it
struck
one
hour
after
another
then
i
crept
out
of
bed
and
put
my
head
out
of
the
window
it
was
a
close
oppressive
night
not
a
breath
seemed
to
be
stirring
i
wondered
what
was
going
on
in
the
next
room
and
whether
i
should
ever
see
my
father
again
then
i
thought
i
heard
a
sound
but
it
was
only
lucy
sobbing
beneath
the
bedclothes
lucy
i
said
glad
to
find
she
was
awake
is
it
a
long
night
yes
norah
she
answered
i
so
frightened
shall
we
have
a
light
found
the
matches
and
lighted
a
candle
but
three
or
four
large
moths
darted
into
the
room
so
that
i
had
to
close
the
window
lay
awake
in
our
little
beds
watching
the
moths
darting
in
and
out
of
the
candle
and
straining
our
ears
for
any
sound
from
our
father
room
each
time
a
door
shut
we
started
and
sat
up
in
bed
listening
would
you
be
frightened
if
you
were
dying
norah
said
lucy
under
her
breath
yes
i
said
i
sure
i
should
there
was
silence
again
for
a
long
time
and
i
thought
lucy
had
fallen
asleep
when
she
got
up
in
bed
and
spoke
again
norah
do
you
think
you
would
go
to
heaven
if
you
were
to
die
yes
of
course
i
said
quickly
why
do
you
ask
me
i
do
think
should
said
lucy
i
almost
sure
i
should
lay
still
for
about
another
hour
and
then
the
door
opened
and
our
mother
came
in
she
was
crying
very
much
and
had
a
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
father
wants
to
see
you
she
said
come
at
once
crept
very
quietly
into
the
room
of
death
and
stood
beside
our
father
bed
his
face
was
so
altered
that
it
frightened
us
and
we
trembled
from
head
to
foot
but
he
held
out
his
hand
to
us
rosalie
and
we
drew
closer
to
him
then
he
whispered
do
forget
your
father
and
do
wait
till
you
come
to
die
to
get
ready
for
another
world
we
kissed
him
and
our
mother
told
us
to
go
back
to
bed
i
never
forgot
my
father
last
words
to
us
and
i
often
wondered
what
made
him
say
them
next
morning
we
heard
that
our
father
was
dead
gerald
arrived
too
late
to
see
him
he
was
at
college
then
and
was
just
preparing
for
his
last
examination
mother
seemed
at
first
very
much
distressed
by
my
father
death
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
and
would
see
no
one
the
funeral
was
a
very
grand
one
all
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
came
to
it
and
lucy
and
i
peeped
out
of
one
of
the
top
windows
to
see
it
start
after
it
was
over
gerald
went
back
to
college
and
my
mother
returned
to
her
novels
i
think
she
thought
rosalie
that
she
would
be
able
to
return
to
her
old
life
much
as
before
but
no
sooner
had
gerald
passed
his
last
examination
than
she
received
a
letter
from
him
to
say
that
he
intended
to
be
married
in
a
few
months
and
to
bring
his
bride
to
the
hall
then
for
the
first
time
the
truth
flashed
upon
my
mother
mind
that
she
would
soon
be
no
longer
the
mistress
of
the
but
would
have
to
seek
a
home
elsewhere
she
seemed
at
first
very
angry
with
gerald
for
marrying
so
early
but
she
could
say
nothing
against
his
choice
for
she
was
a
young
lady
of
title
and
one
in
every
way
suited
to
the
position
she
was
to
occupy
mother
at
length
decided
to
remove
to
a
town
in
the
midland
counties
where
she
would
have
some
good
society
and
plenty
of
gaiety
so
soon
as
her
mourning
for
my
father
was
ended
was
a
great
trial
to
us
leaving
the
old
home
lucy
and
i
went
round
the
park
the
day
before
we
left
gathering
leaves
from
our
favourite
trees
and
taking
a
last
look
at
the
home
of
our
childhood
then
we
walked
through
the
house
and
looked
out
of
the
windows
on
the
lovely
wooded
hills
with
eyes
which
were
full
of
tears
i
have
never
seen
it
since
and
i
shall
never
see
it
again
sometimes
when
we
are
coming
through
the
country
it
brings
it
back
to
my
mind
and
i
could
almost
fancy
i
was
walking
down
one
of
the
long
grassy
terraces
or
wandering
in
the
quiet
shade
of
the
trees
in
the
park
hush
what
was
that
rosalie
said
her
mother
leaning
forward
to
listen
it
music
at
first
rosalie
could
hear
nothing
except
toby
whistling
to
his
horse
and
the
rumbling
of
the
wheels
of
the
caravan
she
went
to
the
door
and
leaned
out
and
listened
once
more
the
sun
was
beginning
to
set
for
mother
had
only
been
able
to
talk
at
intervals
during
the
day
from
her
frequent
fits
of
coughing
and
from
numerous
other
interruptions
such
as
the
preparations
for
dinner
the
halting
to
give
the
horses
rest
and
the
occasional
visits
of
augustus
the
rosy
clouds
were
gathering
in
the
west
as
the
pure
evening
breeze
wafted
to
the
little
girl
ears
the
distant
sound
of
bells
bells
mammie
she
said
turning
round
bells
ca
you
hear
them
said
her
mother
can
hear
them
clearly
now
our
old
nurse
used
to
tell
us
they
were
saying
come
and
pray
come
and
pray
oh
rosalie
it
is
such
a
comfort
to
be
able
to
speak
of
those
days
to
some
one
i
kept
it
all
hidden
up
in
my
heart
till
sometimes
i
have
felt
as
if
it
would
burst
can
see
the
church
now
mammie
said
rosalie
a
pretty
little
grey
church
with
a
tower
and
we
going
through
the
village
are
we
toby
miss
rosie
said
toby
going
to
stop
there
all
night
the
horses
are
tired
out
and
it
so
fair
to
see
that
even
master
can
see
it
now
we
shall
get
on
all
the
quicker
for
giving
them
a
bit
of
rest
you
hear
the
bells
nicely
now
mammie
said
rosalie
turning
round
said
the
poor
woman
sound
just
like
the
bells
of
our
little
church
at
home
i
could
almost
cry
when
i
hear
them
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
village
it
was
growing
dark
and
the
country
people
were
lighting
their
candles
and
gathering
round
their
small
fires
rosalie
could
see
inside
many
a
cheerful
little
home
where
the
firelight
was
shining
on
the
faces
of
the
father
the
mother
and
the
children
how
she
wished
they
had
a
little
home
still
the
chimes
went
on
and
one
and
another
came
out
of
the
small
cottages
and
took
the
road
leading
to
the
church
with
their
books
under
their
arms
toby
drove
on
nearer
and
nearer
the
chimes
sounded
until
at
last
just
as
the
caravan
reached
a
wide
open
common
in
front
of
the
church
they
ceased
and
rosalie
saw
the
last
old
woman
entering
the
church
door
before
the
service
began
the
waggons
and
caravans
were
drawn
up
on
this
open
space
for
the
night
toby
and
the
other
men
led
the
horses
away
to
the
stables
of
the
inn
augustus
followed
them
to
enjoy
himself
amongst
the
lively
company
assembled
in
the
little
and
rosalie
and
her
mother
were
left
alone
dear
said
rosalie
as
soon
as
the
men
had
turned
the
corner
i
go
and
peep
at
the
church
child
said
her
mother
do
make
a
noise
if
the
people
are
inside
rosalie
did
not
wait
for
a
second
permission
but
darted
across
the
common
and
opened
the
church
gate
it
was
getting
dark
now
and
the
gravestones
looked
very
solemn
in
the
twilight
she
went
quickly
past
them
and
crept
along
the
side
of
the
church
to
one
of
the
windows
she
could
see
inside
the
church
quite
well
because
it
was
lighted
up
but
no
one
could
see
her
as
she
was
standing
in
the
dark
churchyard
her
bright
quick
eyes
soon
took
in
all
that
was
to
be
seen
the
minister
was
kneeling
down
and
so
were
all
the
people
there
were
a
good
many
there
though
the
church
was
not
full
as
it
was
the
service
rosalie
watched
at
the
window
until
all
the
people
got
up
from
their
knees
when
the
clergyman
gave
out
a
hymn
and
they
began
to
sing
rosalie
then
looked
for
the
door
that
she
might
hear
the
music
better
it
was
a
warm
evening
and
the
door
was
open
and
before
she
knew
what
she
was
about
she
had
crept
inside
and
was
sitting
on
a
low
seat
just
within
no
one
noticed
her
for
they
were
all
looking
in
the
opposite
direction
rosalie
enjoyed
the
singing
very
much
and
when
it
was
over
the
clergyman
began
to
speak
he
had
a
clear
distinct
voice
and
he
spoke
in
simple
language
which
every
one
could
understand
rosalie
listened
with
all
her
might
it
was
the
first
sermon
she
had
ever
heard
son
of
man
is
come
to
seek
and
to
save
that
which
is
lost
that
was
the
text
of
rosalie
first
sermon
as
soon
as
the
service
was
over
she
stole
out
of
the
church
and
crept
down
the
dark
churchyard
she
had
passed
through
the
little
gate
and
was
crossing
the
common
to
the
caravan
before
the
first
person
had
left
the
church
to
rosalie
joy
her
father
had
not
returned
for
he
had
found
the
society
in
the
village
inn
extremely
attractive
rosalie
mother
looked
up
as
the
child
came
in
have
you
been
all
this
time
rosalie
rosalie
gave
an
account
of
all
she
had
seen
and
told
her
how
she
had
crept
in
at
the
open
door
of
the
church
what
did
the
clergyman
say
child
asked
her
mother
said
your
text
mammie
the
text
that
was
on
your
picture

son
of
man

come
to
seek
and
to
save
that
which
is
lost

tell
you
about

up
and
down
all
over

look
for

and
he
said
we
were
all
the
sheep
and
jesus
was
looking
for
us

think
he
is

about

rosalie
mother
was
quite
still
for
some
time
after
this
rosalie
stood
at
the
caravan
door
watching
the
bright
stars
coming
out
one
by
one
in
the
still
sky

picture

said
rosalie
said
her
mother
suppose
so
then
rosalie
was
still
again
looking
at
the
stars
but
a
sudden
thought
seized
her
ought
i
to
have
said
amen
rosalie
heard
the
people
at
church
say
it
will
it
do
any
good
without

do
think

matters
much
said
her
mother
can
say
it
now
if
you
like
amen
said
rosalie
looking
at
the
stars
again
but
just
then
voices
were
heard
in
the
distance
and
rosalie
saw
her
father
and
the
men
crossing
the
dark
common
and
coming
in
the
direction
of
the
caravan
chapter
vi
a
family
secret
how
sweet
and
calm
the
village
looked
the
next
morning
when
rosalie
woke
and
looked
out
at
it
she
was
quite
sorry
to
leave
it
but
there
was
no
rest
for
these
poor
wanderers
they
must
move
onwards
towards
the
town
where
they
were
next
to
perform
and
as
they
travelled
on
rosalie
mother
went
on
with
her
sad
story
told
you
darling
that
my
mother
took
a
house
in
town
and
that
we
all
moved
there
that
my
brother
gerald
might
take
possession
of
our
old
home
we
were
getting
great
girls
now
and
my
mother
sent
miss
manders
away
and
left
us
to
our
own
devices
sister
lucy
had
been
very
different
since
our
father
died
she
was
so
quiet
and
still
that
i
often
wondered
what
was
the
matter
with
her
she
spent
nearly
all
her
time
reading
her
bible
in
a
little
attic
chamber
i
did
not
know
why
she
went
there
till
one
day
i
went
upstairs
to
get
something
out
of
a
box
and
found
lucy
sitting
in
the
reading
her
little
black
bible
i
asked
her
what
she
read
it
for
and
she
said
oh
norah
it
makes
me
so
happy
wo
you
come
and
read
it
with
me
but
i
tossed
my
head
and
said
i
had
too
much
to
do
to
waste
my
time
like
that
and
i
ran
downstairs
and
tried
to
forget
what
i
had
seen
for
i
knew
that
my
sister
was
right
and
i
was
wrong
oh
rosalie
darling
i
often
thought
if
i
had
listened
to
my
sister
lucy
that
day
what
a
different
life
i
might
have
led
i
must
go
on
i
coming
to
the
saddest
part
of
my
story
and
i
had
better
get
over
it
as
quickly
as
i
can
i
got
older
i
took
to
reading
novels
our
house
was
full
of
them
for
my
mother
spent
her
days
in
devouring
them
i
read
them
and
read
them
till
i
lived
in
them
and
was
never
happy
unless
i
was
fancying
myself
one
of
the
heroines
of
whom
i
read
my
own
life
seemed
dull
and
monotonous
i
wanted
to
see
more
of
the
world
and
to
have
something
romantic
happen
to
me
oh
rosalie
i
got
so
restless
and
discontented
i
used
to
wake
in
the
night
and
wonder
what
fortunes
would
be
and
then
i
used
to
light
the
candle
and
go
on
with
the
exciting
novel
i
had
been
reading
the
night
before
often
i
used
to
read
half
the
night
for
i
could
not
sleep
again
till
i
knew
the
end
of
the
story
i
quite
left
off
saying
my
prayers
for
i
could
not
think
of
anything
of
that
sort
when
i
was
in
the
middle
of
a
novel
was
just
about
this
time
that
i
became
acquainted
with
a
family
of
the
name
of
roehunter
they
were
rich
people
friends
of
my
mother
miss
georgina
and
miss
laura
roehunter
were
very
fast
dashing
girls
they
took
a
great
fancy
to
me
and
we
were
always
together
they
were
passionately
fond
of
the
theatre
and
they
took
me
to
it
night
after
night
could
think
of
nothing
else
rosalie
i
dreamt
of
it
every
night
it
took
even
more
hold
of
me
than
the
novels
had
done
for
it
seemed
to
me
like
a
novel
i
admired
the
scenery
i
admired
the
actors
i
admired
everything
that
i
saw
i
thought
if
i
was
only
on
the
stage
i
should
be
perfectly
happy
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
that
i
wanted
so
much
it
seemed
to
me
such
a
free
happy
romantic
life
when
an
actress
was
greeted
with
bursts
of
applause
i
almost
envied
her
how
wearisome
my
life
seemed
when
compared
with
hers
kept
a
book
then
rosalie
darling
in
which
i
wrote
all
that
i
did
every
day
and
i
used
to
write
again
and
again
no
change
yet
my
life
wants
variety
it
is
the
same
over
and
over
again
determined
that
as
soon
as
possible
i
would
have
a
change
cost
what
it
might
after
this
the
roehunters
told
me
that
they
were
going
to
have
some
private
theatricals
and
that
i
must
come
and
help
them
it
was
just
what
i
wanted
now
i
thought
i
could
fancy
myself
an
actress
engaged
some
of
the
professional
actors
at
the
theatre
to
teach
us
our
parts
to
arrange
the
scenery
and
to
help
us
to
do
everything
in
the
best
possible
manner
i
had
to
go
up
to
the
roehunters
again
and
again
to
learn
my
part
of
the
performance
and
there
it
was
rosalie
dear
that
i
met
your
father
he
was
one
of
the
actors
whom
they
employed
can
guess
what
came
next
my
darling
your
father
saw
how
well
i
could
act
and
how
passionately
fond
i
was
of
it
and
by
degrees
he
found
out
how
much
i
should
like
to
do
it
always
instead
of
leading
my
humdrum
life
at
home
so
he
used
to
meet
me
in
the
street
and
talk
to
me
about
it
and
he
told
me
that
if
i
would
only
come
with
him
i
should
have
a
life
of
pleasure
and
excitement
and
never
know
what
care
was
and
he
arranged
that
the
day
after
these
private
theatricals
we
should
run
away
and
be
married
darling
i
shall
never
forget
that
day
i
arrived
home
late
at
night
or
rather
early
in
the
morning
worn
out
with
the
evening
entertainment
i
had
been
much
praised
for
the
way
i
had
performed
my
part
and
some
of
the
company
had
declared
i
should
make
a
actress
and
i
thought
to
myself
that
they
little
knew
how
soon
i
was
to
become
one
as
i
drove
home
i
felt
in
a
perfect
whirl
of
excitement
the
day
had
come
at
last
was
i
glad
i
hardly
knew
i
tried
to
think
i
was
but
somehow
i
felt
sick
at
heart
i
could
not
shake
that
feeling
off
and
as
i
walked
upstairs
i
felt
perfectly
miserable
mother
had
gone
to
bed
and
i
never
saw
her
again
lucy
was
fast
asleep
lying
with
her
hand
under
her
cheek
sleeping
peacefully
i
stood
a
minute
or
two
looking
at
her
her
little
bible
was
lying
beside
her
for
she
had
been
reading
it
the
last
thing
before
she
went
to
sleep
oh
rosalie
i
would
have
given
anything
to
change
places
with
lucy
then
but
it
was
too
late
now
augustus
was
to
meet
me
outside
the
house
and
we
were
to
be
married
at
a
church
in
the
town
that
very
morning
our
names
had
been
posted
up
in
the
register
office
some
weeks
before
turned
away
from
lucy
and
began
putting
some
things
together
to
take
with
me
and
i
hid
them
under
the
bed
lest
lucy
should
wake
and
see
them
it
was
no
use
going
to
bed
for
i
had
not
got
home
from
the
theatricals
till
three
and
in
two
hours
augustus
would
come
so
i
scribbled
a
little
note
to
my
mother
telling
her
that
when
she
received
it
i
should
be
married
and
that
i
would
call
and
see
her
in
a
few
days
then
i
put
out
the
light
lest
it
should
wake
my
sister
and
sat
waiting
in
the
dark
and
rosie
dear
that
star
the
same
star
that
i
had
seen
that
night
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
had
told
that
lie
that
same
star
came
and
looked
in
at
the
window
and
again
it
seemed
to
me
like
the
eye
of
god
felt
so
frightened
that
once
i
thought
i
would
not
go
i
almost
determined
to
write
augustus
a
note
giving
it
up
but
i
thought
that
he
would
laugh
at
me
for
being
such
a
coward
and
i
tried
to
picture
to
myself
once
more
how
fine
it
would
be
to
be
a
real
actress
and
be
always
praised
as
i
had
been
last
night
i
got
up
and
drew
down
the
blind
that
i
might
hide
the
star
from
sight
i
was
so
glad
to
see
it
beginning
to
get
light
for
i
knew
that
the
star
would
fade
away
and
that
augustus
would
soon
come
last
the
church
clock
struck
five
so
i
took
my
carpetbag
from
under
the
bed
wrapped
myself
up
in
a
warm
shawl
and
leaving
my
note
on
the
prepared
to
go
downstairs
but
i
turned
back
when
i
got
to
the
door
to
look
once
more
at
my
sister
lucy
and
rosalie
darling
as
i
looked
i
felt
as
if
my
tears
would
choke
me
i
wiped
them
hastily
away
however
and
crept
downstairs
every
creaking
board
made
me
jump
and
tremble
lest
i
should
be
discovered
and
at
every
turning
i
expected
to
see
some
one
watching
me
but
no
one
appeared
i
got
down
safely
and
cautiously
unbolting
the
hall
door
i
stole
quietly
out
into
the
street
and
soon
found
augustus
who
carried
my
bag
under
his
arm
and
that
morning
we
were
married
then
my
troubles
began
it
was
not
half
as
pleasant
being
an
actress
as
i
had
thought
it
would
be
i
knew
nothing
then
of
the
life
behind
the
scenes
i
did
not
know
how
tired
i
should
be
nor
what
a
comfortless
life
i
should
lead
rosalie
i
was
soon
sick
of
it
i
would
have
given
worlds
to
be
back
in
my
old
home
i
would
have
given
worlds
to
lead
that
quiet
peaceful
life
again
i
was
much
praised
and
applauded
in
the
theatre
but
after
a
time
i
cared
very
little
for
it
and
as
for
the
acting
itself
i
became
thoroughly
sick
of
it
oh
rosalie
dear
i
have
often
and
often
fallen
asleep
unable
to
undress
myself
from
weariness
after
acting
in
the
play
and
again
and
again
i
have
wished
that
i
had
never
seen
the
inside
of
a
theatre
and
never
known
anything
of
the
wretched
life
of
an
actress
stopped
for
some
time
in
the
town
where
my
mother
lived
for
augustus
had
an
engagement
in
a
theatre
there
and
he
procured
one
for
me
we
had
miserable
lodgings
and
often
were
very
badly
off
i
called
at
home
a
few
days
after
i
was
married
but
the
servant
shut
the
door
in
my
face
saying
that
my
mother
never
wished
to
see
me
again
or
to
hear
my
name
mentioned
i
used
to
walk
up
and
down
outside
trying
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
my
sister
lucy
but
she
was
never
allowed
to
go
out
alone
and
i
could
not
get
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
all
my
old
friends
passed
me
in
the
street
even
the
roehunters
would
take
no
notice
of
me
whatever
then
your
father
lost
his
engagement
at
the
theatre
i
need
not
tell
you
why
rosalie
darling
and
we
left
the
town
and
then
i
began
to
know
what
poverty
meant
we
travelled
from
place
to
place
sometimes
getting
occasional
jobs
at
small
town
theatres
sometimes
stopping
at
a
town
for
a
few
months
and
then
being
dismissed
and
travelling
on
for
weeks
without
hearing
of
any
employment
then
it
was
that
your
little
brother
was
born
such
a
pretty
baby
he
was
and
i
named
him
arthur
after
my
father
i
was
very
very
poor
when
he
was
born
and
i
could
hardly
get
clothes
for
him
to
wear
but
oh
rosalie
darling
i
loved
him
very
much
i
wrote
to
my
mother
to
tell
her
about
it
and
that
baby
was
to
be
christened
after
my
father
but
she
sent
back
my
letter
unread
and
i
never
wrote
to
her
again
and
one
day
when
i
took
up
a
newspaper
i
saw
my
mother
death
in
it
and
i
heard
afterwards
that
she
said
on
her
dying
bed
that
i
was
not
to
be
told
of
her
death
till
she
was
put
under
the
ground
for
i
had
been
a
disgrace
and
a
shame
to
the
family
and
that
they
said
was
the
only
time
that
she
mentioned
me
after
the
week
that
i
ran
away
sister
lucy
wrote
me
a
very
kind
letter
after
my
mother
died
and
sent
me
some
presents
but
i
was
sorry
for
it
afterwards
for
your
father
kept
writing
to
her
for
money
and
telling
her
long
tales
about
the
distress
i
was
in
to
make
her
send
us
more
often
sent
us
money
but
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
bear
to
take
it
and
she
used
to
write
me
such
beautiful
letters
to
beg
me
to
come
to
jesus
and
to
remember
what
my
father
had
said
to
us
when
he
died
she
said
jesus
had
made
her
happy
and
would
make
me
happy
too
i
often
think
now
of
what
she
said
rosalie
after
a
time
i
heard
that
lucy
was
married
to
a
clergyman
and
your
father
heard
it
too
and
he
kept
writing
to
her
and
asking
her
for
money
again
and
again
and
at
last
came
a
letter
from
her
husband
in
which
he
said
that
he
was
very
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
tell
us
that
his
wife
could
do
no
more
for
us
and
he
requested
that
no
more
letters
on
the
same
subject
might
be
addressed
to
her
as
they
would
receive
no
reply
father
wrote
again
but
they
did
not
answer
it
and
since
then
they
have
left
the
town
where
they
were
living
and
he
lost
all
clue
to
them
and
rosalie
darling
i
hope
he
will
never
find
them
again
i
can
not
bear
to
be
an
annoyance
to
my
sister
lucy
my
dear
little
sister
lucy
for
gerald
he
has
taken
no
notice
of
us
at
all
your
father
has
written
to
him
from
time
to
time
but
his
letters
have
always
been
returned
to
him
so
we
went
on
getting
poorer
and
poorer
once
your
father
took
a
situation
as
a
in
a
small
country
village
and
there
was
a
lady
there
who
was
very
kind
to
me
she
used
to
come
and
see
my
little
arthur
he
was
very
delicate
and
at
last
he
took
a
dreadful
cold
and
it
settled
on
his
chest
and
my
poor
little
lamb
died
and
rosalie
darling
when
i
buried
him
under
a
little
in
that
country
churchyard
i
felt
as
if
i
had
nothing
left
to
live
for
did
not
stay
in
that
village
long
we
were
neither
of
us
used
to
keeping
accounts
and
we
got
them
in
a
complete
muddle
so
i
had
to
leave
behind
my
little
grave
and
the
only
home
we
ever
had
your
father
fell
in
with
a
strolling
actor
who
was
in
the
habit
of
frequenting
fairs
and
between
them
by
selling
their
furniture
and
almost
everything
they
possessed
they
bought
some
scenery
and
a
caravan
and
started
a
travelling
theatre
and
when
the
man
died
rosalie
he
left
his
share
of
it
to
your
father
the
last
twelve
years
my
darling
i
been
moving
about
from
place
to
place
just
as
we
are
doing
now
and
in
this
caravan
my
little
girl
you
were
born
i
was
very
ill
a
long
time
after
that
and
could
not
take
my
place
in
the
theatre
and
for
many
reasons
that
was
the
most
miserable
part
of
my
miserable
life
now
little
woman
i
told
you
all
i
need
tell
you
at
present
perhaps
some
day
i
can
give
you
more
particulars
but
you
will
have
some
idea
now
why
i
am
so
utterly
wretched
utterly
wretched
said
the
poor
woman
hope
for
this
world
and
no
hope
for
the
next
poor
mammie
said
little
rosalie
stroking
her
hand
very
gently
and
tenderly
mammie
dear
all
my
own
fault
child
said
her
mother
brought
it
all
upon
my
self
and
i
no
one
but
myself
to
blame
poor
mammie
said
rosalie
again
then
the
sick
woman
seemed
quite
exhausted
and
lay
upon
her
bed
for
some
time
without
speaking
or
moving
rosalie
sat
by
the
door
of
the
caravan
and
sang
softly
to
herself
i
thy
face
am
seeking
early
will
i
come
to
thee
rosalie
said
her
mother
looking
round
did
come
to
him
early
oh
if
i
only
had
mind
you
do
rosie
it
so
much
easier
for
you
now
than
when
you
get
to
be
old
and
wicked
like
me
that
what
in
the
sunshine
of
the
morning
means
in
the
next
verse
mammie
dear
rosalie
said
her
mother
means
when
you
young
and
happy
oh
dear
dear
if
i
only
come
to
him
then
do
you
come
now
mammie
dear
do
know
i
do
expect
he
would
take
me
now
oh
i
have
been
such
a
sinner
there
are
other
things
child
i
have
not
told
you
about
and
they
are
all
coming
back
to
my
mind
now
i
do
know
how
it
is
rosalie
i
never
thought
so
much
of
them
before
the
good
shepherd
is
beginning
to
find
you
mammie
do
know
rosalie
i
wish
i
could
think
that
anyhow
they
are
all
rising
up
as
clear
as
if
i
saw
them
all
some
of
them
are
things
i
did
years
and
years
ago
even
when
i
was
a
little
girl
in
that
old
home
in
the
country
they
are
all
coming
hack
to
me
now
and
oh
i
am
so
very
very
miserable
said
her
father
voice
at
the
door
of
the
caravan
into
the
next
waggon
we
a
new
play
on
at
this
town
and
you
have
your
part
to
learn
come
away
so
rosalie
had
to
leave
her
poor
mother
and
instead
of
singing
the
soothing
words
of
the
hymn
she
had
to
repeat
again
and
again
the
foolish
and
senseless
words
which
had
fallen
to
her
share
in
the
new
play
which
her
father
was
getting
up
over
and
over
again
she
repeated
them
till
she
was
weary
of
their
very
sound
her
father
scolding
her
if
she
made
a
mistake
or
failed
to
give
each
word
its
proper
emphasis
and
when
she
was
released
it
was
time
to
get
tea
ready
and
then
they
halted
for
the
night
at
a
small
just
eight
miles
from
lesborough
where
they
were
next
to
perform
and
which
they
were
to
enter
the
next
morning
as
the
fair
began
on
monday
chapter
vii
the
circus
procession
it
was
a
bright
sunshiny
morning
when
the
theatre
party
reached
lesborough
not
a
cloud
was
to
be
seen
in
the
sky
and
augustus
was
in
capital
spirits
for
he
thought
that
if
the
fine
weather
lasted
his
profits
would
be
larger
than
usual
on
the
road
leading
to
the
town
they
passed
several
small
shows
bound
for
the
same
destination
there
was
the
show
of
lancashire
lass
exhibition
of
the
performing
little
pigs
polglaze
living
curiosities
and
show
of
the
giant
horse
augustus
knew
the
proprietor
of
nearly
every
caravan
that
passed
them
and
they
exchanged
greetings
by
the
way
and
congratulated
each
other
on
the
fine
weather
which
seemed
to
be
before
them
then
they
drew
near
the
town
and
heard
a
tremendous
noise
in
the
distance
as
they
entered
the
main
street
they
saw
a
cloud
of
dust
in
front
of
them
and
then
an
immense
crowd
of
people
rosalie
and
her
mother
came
to
the
door
of
the
caravan
and
looked
out
presently
the
dust
cleared
away
and
showed
them
a
glittering
gilded
car
which
was
coming
towards
them
surrounded
by
throngs
of
boys
and
girls
men
and
women
is
it
toby
asked
rosalie
a
large
circus
miss
rosie
master
said
they
were
going
to
be
here
and
he
was
afraid
they
would
carry
a
good
many
people
off
from
us
the
theatre
party
had
to
draw
up
on
one
side
of
the
street
to
let
the
long
procession
pass
first
came
a
gilded
car
filled
with
musicians
who
were
playing
a
noisy
tune
this
was
followed
by
about
a
dozen
men
on
horseback
some
dressed
in
shining
armour
as
knights
of
the
olden
time
and
others
as
cavaliers
of
the
time
of
the
stuarts
then
came
another
large
gilded
car
on
the
top
of
which
was
a
golden
dragon
with
coloured
reins
round
its
neck
which
were
held
by
an
old
man
dressed
as
an
ancient
briton
and
supposed
to
personate
george
then
came
a
number
of
mounted
ladies
dressed
in
brilliant
velvet
habits
one
green
one
red
one
yellow
one
violet
each
of
them
holding
long
orange
reins
which
were
fastened
to
spirited
piebald
horses
which
they
drove
before
them
these
were
followed
by
a
man
riding
on
two
ponies
standing
with
one
leg
on
each
and
going
at
a
great
pace
then
two
little
girls
and
a
little
boy
passed
on
three
diminutive
ponies
and
next
a
tiny
carriage
drawn
by
four
little
horses
and
driven
by
a
boy
dressed
as
the
lord
mayor
coachman
then
came
an
absurd
succession
of
clowns
driving
riding
or
standing
on
donkeys
and
dressed
in
hideous
costumes
then
three
or
four
very
tall
and
fine
horses
led
by
grooms
in
scarlet
and
lastly
an
enormous
gilded
car
drawn
by
six
piebald
horses
with
coloured
flags
on
their
heads
on
the
top
of
this
car
sat
a
girl
intended
for
britannia
dressed
in
white
with
a
scarlet
scarf
across
her
shoulders
a
helmet
on
her
head
and
a
trident
in
her
hand
she
was
leaning
against
two
large
shields
which
alone
prevented
her
from
falling
from
her
giddy
height
some
way
below
her
in
front
of
the
car
sat
her
two
maidens
dressed
in
glittering
silver
tinsel
upon
which
the
rays
of
the
sun
made
it
dazzling
to
look
whilst
behind
her
clinging
on
to
the
back
of
the
car
were
two
men
whose
scaly
armour
was
also
shining
brightly
then
the
procession
was
over
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
or
seen
but
a
noisy
rabble
who
were
hastening
on
to
get
another
glimpse
of
the
wonderful
sight
there
were
some
girls
standing
near
the
caravan
close
to
rosalie
and
her
mother
as
the
circus
procession
passed
and
they
were
perfectly
enraptured
with
all
they
saw
when
britannia
came
in
sight
they
could
hardly
contain
themselves
so
envious
were
they
of
her
one
of
them
told
the
other
she
would
give
anything
to
be
sitting
up
there
dressed
in
gold
and
silver
and
she
thought
britannia
must
be
as
happy
as
queen
victoria
said
rosalie
mother
leaning
out
and
speaking
in
a
low
voice
would
get
tired
of
it
i
said
the
girl
only
wish
i
had
the
chance
rosalie
mother
sighed
and
said
to
rosalie
things
they
little
know
i
should
not
wonder
if
that
poor
girl
is
about
as
wretched
as
i
am
but
people
do
consider
they
know
nothing
about
it
they
have
to
be
behind
the
scenes
to
know
what
it
is
like
nothing
further
happened
until
the
theatre
party
reached
the
place
where
the
fair
was
to
be
held
it
was
a
large
open
square
in
the
middle
of
the
town
which
was
generally
used
as
a
although
it
was
only
saturday
morning
and
the
fair
was
not
to
begin
until
monday
many
of
the
shows
had
already
arrived
the
marionettes
and
the
show
had
completed
their
arrangements
and
one
of
the
whirligigs
was
already
in
action
and
from
time
to
time
its
proprietor
rang
a
large
bell
to
call
together
a
fresh
company
of
riders
the
children
had
a
holiday
as
it
was
saturday
and
they
rushed
home
and
clamoured
for
pennies
that
they
might
spend
them
in
sitting
on
a
wooden
horse
or
elephant
or
camel
or
in
one
of
the
small
omnibuses
or
open
carriages
and
then
being
taken
round
by
means
of
steam
at
a
tremendous
pace
till
their
breath
was
nearly
gone
and
when
they
alighted
once
more
on
the
ground
they
hardly
knew
where
they
were
or
whether
they
were
standing
on
their
heads
or
on
their
feet
and
for
long
after
many
of
these
children
were
dizzy
and
sick
and
felt
as
if
they
were
walking
on
ground
which
gave
way
beneath
them
as
they
trod
on
it
as
soon
as
augustus
arrived
at
the
place
where
his
theatre
was
to
be
erected
he
and
his
men
began
their
work
for
the
next
few
hours
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
on
all
sides
but
rapping
and
hammering
every
one
working
with
all
his
might
to
get
everything
finished
before
sunset
each
half
hour
fresh
shows
arrived
had
their
ground
measured
out
for
them
by
the
and
began
to
unload
and
fasten
up
immediately
rosalie
stood
at
the
door
and
looked
out
but
she
had
seen
it
all
so
often
before
that
it
was
no
amusement
to
her
and
she
felt
very
glad
as
one
by
one
the
shows
were
finished
and
the
hammering
ceased
but
just
as
she
hoped
that
all
was
becoming
quiet
she
heard
a
dreadful
noise
at
the
back
of
the
caravan
it
was
her
father
voice
and
he
was
in
a
towering
passion
with
one
of
the
men
who
had
annoyed
him
by
neglecting
to
put
up
part
of
the
scaffolding
properly
the
two
men
shouted
at
each
other
for
some
time
and
a
large
number
of
people
who
were
strolling
about
amongst
the
shows
collected
round
them
to
see
what
was
the
matter
at
length
a
policeman
seeing
the
crowd
came
and
ordered
them
off
and
they
were
obliged
to
retreat
inside
the
theatre
that
night
augustus
came
into
the
caravan
to
smoke
his
pipe
and
informed
his
wife
that
it
was
very
well
she
was
so
much
better
for
he
and
conrad
had
had
a
disagreement
and
conrad
had
taken
his
things
and
gone
off
so
of
course
she
would
have
to
take
her
part
on
monday
night
rosalie
looked
at
her
mother
and
rosalie
mother
looked
at
her
but
neither
of
them
spoke
but
as
soon
as
her
father
had
left
them
for
the
night
rosalie
said
dear
you
be
able
to
stand
all
that
long
long
time
i
sure
it
will
make
you
worse
mammie
dear
mind
rosalie
it
no
use
telling
your
father
he
thinks
i
am
only
complaining
if
i
do
oh
mammie
dear
what
if
it
makes
you
bad
again
as
it
did
before
ca
be
helped
child
i
shall
have
to
do
it
so
it
no
use
talking
about
it
i
may
as
well
do
it
without
making
a
fuss
about
it
your
father
is
put
out
darling
and
it
would
never
do
to
annoy
him
more
but
little
rosalie
was
not
satisfied
she
looked
very
tenderly
and
sorrowfully
at
her
mother
and
the
next
morning
she
went
timidly
to
tell
her
father
that
she
did
not
think
her
mother
would
ever
get
through
her
part
she
was
too
weak
for
it
but
he
told
her
shortly
to
mind
her
own
business
so
little
rosalie
could
do
nothing
more
nothing
except
watch
her
mother
very
carefully
and
gently
all
that
long
dreary
sunday
scarcely
allowing
her
to
rise
from
her
seat
but
fetching
her
everything
she
wanted
and
looking
forward
sick
at
heart
to
the
morrow
the
chimed
in
all
directions
crowds
of
people
in
their
sunday
clothes
passed
along
the
to
church
or
chapel
but
to
rosalie
and
her
mother
sunday
brought
no
joy
it
was
a
fine
bright
day
so
most
of
the
were
roaming
about
the
town
but
rosalie
mother
was
too
weak
to
go
out
and
her
little
girl
did
not
like
to
leave
her
said
her
mother
that
sunday
afternoon
going
to
give
you
a
present
present
for
me
mammie
dear
said
rosalie
little
woman
pull
that
large
box
from
under
the
bed
it
rather
heavy
dear
can
you
manage
it
yes
mammie
dear
quite
well
rosalie
mother
sat
down
by
the
box
and
began
to
unpack
it
at
the
top
of
the
box
were
some
of
her
clothes
and
rosalie
but
it
was
a
long
time
since
she
had
turned
out
the
things
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
she
took
out
from
it
a
small
bundle
pinned
up
in
a
towel
then
calling
rosalie
to
her
side
she
drew
out
the
pins
one
by
one
and
opened
it
inside
were
several
small
parcels
carefully
tied
up
in
paper
in
the
first
parcel
was
a
little
pair
of
blue
shoes
with
a
tiny
red
sock
were
my
little
arthur
rosalie
said
her
mother
with
tears
in
her
eyes
put
them
away
the
day
he
was
buried
and
i
never
liked
to
part
with
them
no
one
will
care
for
them
when
i
gone
though
said
she
with
a
sigh
mammie
dear
said
rosalie
talk
so
the
next
parcel
contained
a
small
square
box
but
before
she
opened
it
she
went
to
the
door
and
looked
cautiously
out
then
after
seeing
that
no
one
was
near
she
touched
a
spring
and
took
out
of
the
case
a
beautiful
little
locket
there
was
a
circle
of
pearls
all
round
it
and
the
letters
were
engraved
in
a
monogram
outside
then
she
opened
the
locket
and
showed
rosalie
the
picture
of
a
girl
with
a
very
sweet
and
gentle
face
and
large
soft
brown
eyes
darling
said
her
mother
is
my
sister
lucy
rosalie
took
the
locket
in
her
hand
and
looked
at
it
very
earnestly
said
the
poor
woman
is
my
sister
lucy
my
own
sister
lucy
i
have
looked
at
it
for
many
a
day
i
can
hardly
bear
to
look
at
it
now
for
i
shall
never
see
her
again
never
darling
what
that
rosalie
she
said
fearfully
covering
the
locket
with
her
apron
as
some
one
passed
the
caravan
only
some
men
strolling
through
the
fair
mammie
dear
said
rosalie
i
would
have
your
father
see
this
for
the
world
he
would
soon
sell
it
if
he
did
i
hid
it
up
all
these
years
and
never
let
him
find
it
i
could
not
bear
to
part
with
it
she
gave
it
to
me
my
last
birthday
that
i
was
at
home
i
remember
it
so
well
rosalie
dear
i
had
been
very
disagreeable
to
lucy
a
long
time
before
that
for
i
knew
i
was
doing
wrong
and
i
had
such
a
weight
on
my
mind
that
i
could
not
shake
it
off
and
it
made
me
cross
and
irritable
was
never
cross
with
me
she
always
spoke
gently
and
kindly
to
me
and
i
sometimes
even
wished
she
would
be
angry
that
i
might
have
some
excuse
for
my
bad
behaviour
dear
when
i
woke
that
morning
i
found
this
little
box
laid
on
my
pillow
and
a
note
with
it
asking
me
to
accept
this
little
gift
from
my
sister
lucy
and
always
to
keep
it
for
her
sake
oh
rosalie
darling
was
it
good
of
her
when
i
had
been
so
bad
to
her
i
kissed
her
and
thanked
her
for
it
and
i
wore
it
round
my
neck
and
when
i
ran
away
that
morning
i
put
it
safely
in
my
bag
and
i
kept
it
ever
since
your
father
has
not
seen
it
for
many
years
and
he
has
forgotten
all
about
it
when
we
were
so
poor
i
used
to
be
so
afraid
he
would
remember
this
locket
and
sell
it
as
he
did
all
my
other
jewels
it
was
hard
enough
parting
with
some
of
them
but
i
did
not
care
so
much
so
long
as
i
kept
this
one
for
i
promised
lucy
that
morning
that
i
would
part
with
it
is
pretty
mammie
dear
said
rosalie
child
it
will
be
yours
some
day
when
i
die
remember
it
is
for
you
but
you
must
never
let
it
be
sold
or
pawned
rosalie
i
could
bear
to
think
it
ever
would
be
and
now
we
put
it
back
again
it
wo
be
safe
here
your
father
might
come
in
any
minute
one
more
parcel
mammie

that
out

present

her
mother
give
you
the
locket
yet
because
i
must
keep
it
till
i
die
but
you
shall
have
the
other
she
took
off
the
paper
and
put
into
rosalie
hands
a
small
black
testament
the
child
opened
the
book
and
read
on
the
augustus
joyce
from
her
friend
bernard
in
remembrance
of
little
arthur
and
with
the
prayer
that
she
may
meet
her
child
in
heaven
promised
her
that
i
would
read
it
rosalie
but
i
have
said
the
poor
woman
read
a
few
verses
the
first
week
she
gave
it
to
me
but
never
read
it
since
i
wish
i
had
oh
i
wish
i
had
me
read
it
to
you
mammie
dear
what
i
got
it
out
for
darling
you
might
read
a
bit
of
it
to
me
every
day
i
do
know
whether
it
will
do
me
any
good
it
almost
too
late
now
but
i
can
but
try
i
begin
at
once
mammie
dear
directly
rosalie
i
just
write
your
name
in
it
that
you
may
always
remember
your
mother
when
you
see
it
so
rosalie
brought
her
a
pen
and
ink
and
she
wrote
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
little
rosalie
with
her
mother
love
now
child
you
may
begin
to
read
shall
it
be
mammie
dear
the
part
about
your
picture
dear
i
should
think
it
will
say
under
the
text
where
it
is
with
some
trouble
rosalie
found
luke
xv
and
began
to
read
he
spake
this
parable
unto
them
saying
what
man
of
you
having
an
hundred
sheep
if
he
lose
one
of
them
doth
not
leave
the
ninety
and
nine
in
the
wilderness
and
go
after
that
which
is
lost
until
he
find
it
and
when
he
hath
found
it
he
layeth
it
on
his
shoulders
rejoicing
and
when
he
cometh
home
he
calleth
together
his
friends
and
neighbours
saying
unto
them
rejoice
with
me
for
i
have
found
my
sheep
which
was
lost
i
say
unto
you
that
likewise
joy
shall
be
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
more
than
over
ninety
and
nine
just
persons
which
need
no
repentance
need
repentance
rosalie
child
said
her
mother
is
repentance
mammie
dear
means
being
sorry
for
what
you
done
rosalie
darling
and
hating
yourself
for
it
and
wishing
never
to
do
wrong
again
mammie
if
you
need
repentance
you
must
be
like
the
sheep
not
like
the
child
i
a
lost
sheep
there
no
doubt
about
that
i
gone
very
far
astray
so
far
that
i
do
suppose
i
shall
ever
get
back
again
much
easier
to
get
wrong
than
to
get
right
it
a
hard
thing
to
find
the
right
road
when
you
once
missed
it
it
does
seem
much
use
my
trying
to
get
back
i
have
such
a
long
way
to
go
mammie
dear
is
it
just
like
the
sheep
do
you
mean
rosalie
darling
the
sheep
could
find
its
way
back
could
it
mammie
sheep
never
can
find
their
way
and
this
sheep
did
walk
back
did
it
he
carried
it
on
his
shoulder
like
my
picture
i
do
suppose
it
would
seem
so
very
far
when
he
carried
it
rosalie
mother
made
no
answer
when
her
child
said
this
but
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
about
it
she
sat
looking
thoughtfully
out
of
the
window
much
very
much
was
passing
in
her
mind
then
rosalie
closed
the
testament
and
wrapping
it
carefully
in
the
paper
in
which
it
had
been
kept
so
many
years
she
hid
it
away
in
the
box
again
it
was
sunday
evening
now
and
once
more
the
rang
and
once
more
the
people
went
past
with
books
in
their
hands
rosalie
wished
very
much
that
she
could
creep
into
one
of
the
churches
and
hear
another
sermon
but
just
then
her
father
and
the
men
came
back
and
wanted
their
tea
and
instead
of
the
quiet
service
rosalie
had
to
listen
to
their
loud
talking
and
noisy
laughter
and
then
her
father
sent
for
her
into
the
large
caravan
and
made
her
go
through
her
part
of
the
play
she
was
just
finishing
her
recital
as
the
people
passed
back
again
from
evening
service
chapter
viii
little
mother
manikin
it
was
monday
night
and
rosalie
mother
was
dressing
herself
to
be
ready
to
act
in
the
play
rosalie
was
standing
beside
her
setting
out
the
folds
of
her
white
dress
and
fetching
everything
she
needed
her
large
necklace
of
pearl
beads
the
wreath
of
white
lilies
for
her
hair
and
the
bracelets
rings
and
other
articles
of
mock
jewellery
with
which
she
was
adorned
all
these
rosalie
brought
to
her
and
the
poor
woman
put
them
on
one
by
one
standing
before
the
tiny
to
arrange
them
in
their
proper
places
it
was
a
very
thin
sorrowful
face
which
that
glass
reflected
so
ill
and
careworn
so
weary
and
sad
as
soon
as
she
was
ready
she
sat
down
on
one
of
the
boxes
whilst
rosalie
dressed
herself
mammie
dear
said
rosalie
sure
you
are
not
fit
to
act
rosalie
said
her
mother
speak
of
that
now
come
and
sit
beside
me
darling
and
let
me
do
your
hair
for
you
and
before
we
go
rosalie
dear
sing
your
little
hymn
rosalie
tried
to
sing
it
but
somehow
her
voice
trembled
and
she
could
not
sing
it
very
steadily
there
was
such
a
sad
expression
in
her
face
that
in
the
midst
of
the
hymn
little
rosalie
burst
into
tears
and
threw
her
arms
round
her
mother
neck
cry

cry
said
her
mother

the
matter

head
sorrowfully

caravan

this
life

and
was

little
girl

it
was
your
aunt
lucy
as
soon
as
that
young
woman
mentioned
her
name
lucy
married
a
leslie
and
it
was
just
like
her
to
read
to
those
people
in
the
cottages
just
as
she
used
to
do
when
we
lived
in
that
town
of
which
i
told
you
i
really
seen
her
said
rosalie
darling
and

you
can
go
to
your
aunt

that
letter

and
show

that
locket
she
will
remember
it
as
soon
as
she
sees
it
and
tell
her
darling
that
i
never
never
parted
with
it
all
these
long
dreary
years
why
wo
you
come
with
me
mammie
dear
ask
me
that
now
darling
it
nearly
time
for
us
to
go
into
the
theatre
but
before
you
go
just
read
those
verses
about
your
picture
once
through
we
shall
just
about
have
time
for
it
before
your
father
comes
so
rosalie
read
once
more
the
parable
of
the
lost
sheep
child
said
her
mother
when
she
had
finished
are
four
words
in
that
story
which
i
had
in
my
mind
oh
so
many
times
since
you
read
it
last
are
they
mammie
dear
until
he
find
it
rosalie
all
last
night
i
lay
awake
coughing
and
i
kept
thinking
there
was
no
hope
for
me
it
was
no
use
my
asking
the
good
shepherd
to
look
for
me
but
all
of
a
sudden
those
words
came
back
to
me
just
as
if
some
one
had
said
them
to
me
until
he
find
it
until
he
find
it
he
goeth
after
that
which
is
lost
until
he
find
it
it
seems
he
does
give
up
at
once
he
goes
on
looking
until
he
find
it
and
then
it
seemed
to
me
rosalie
i
do
know
if
i
was
right
i
do
know
if
i
even
dare
hope
it
but
it
seemed
to
me
last
night
that
perhaps
if
he
takes
such
pains
and
looks
so
long
if
he
goes
on
he
find
there
might
even
be
a
chance
for
me
you
ready
said
augustus
voice
at
the
door
of
the
caravan
just
going
to
begin
rosalie
and
her
mother
jumped
hastily
up
and
thrusting
the
testament
into
the
box
they
hurried
down
the
caravan
steps
and
went
into
the
theatre
there
were
still
a
few
minutes
before
the
performance
commenced
and
rosalie
made
her
mother
sit
down
on
a
chair
in
the
little
room
behind
the
stage
that
she
might
rest
as
long
as
possible
several
of
the
company
came
up
to
the
poor
woman
and
asked
her
how
she
was
in
tones
which
spoke
of
rough
though
kindly
sympathy
rosalie
looked
earnestly
in
their
faces
and
read
there
that
they
did
not
think
her
mother
equal
to
her
work
and
it
filled
her
little
heart
with
sorrowful
forebodings
she
had
never
seen
her
mother
look
more
lovely
than
she
did
at
the
beginning
of
the
play
there
was
a
bright
colour
in
her
face
and
her
beautiful
eyes
shone
more
brilliantly
than
ever
before
rosalie
really
hoped
she
must
be
better
to
look
so
well
as
that
but
there
was
a
weary
sorrowful
expression
in
her
face
which
went
to
the
child
heart
her
mother
repeated
the
words
of
the
play
as
if
they
were
extremely
distasteful
to
her
and
as
if
she
could
hardly
bear
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
in
her
eyes
there
was
a
wistful
yearning
as
if
she
were
looking
at
and
longing
for
something
far
far
away
from
the
noisy
theatre
she
never
smiled
at
the
bursts
of
applause
she
repeated
her
part
almost
mechanically
and
from
time
to
time
rosalie
saw
her
mother
eyes
fill
with
tears
she
crept
to
her
side
and
put
her
little
hand
in
hers
as
they
went
up
to
the
platform
after
the
first
performance
was
over
her
mother
hand
was
burning
with
fever
and
yet
she
shivered
from
head
to
foot
as
they
went
out
on
the
platform
into
the
chill
night
air
mammie
dear
said
rosalie
in
a
whisper
ought
to
go
back
to
the
caravan
now
but
rosalie
mother
shook
her
head
mournfully
about
through
the
next
play
there
came
a
long
piece
which
rosalie
had
to
recite
alone
the
piece
which
her
father
had
been
teaching
her
during
the
last
week
she
was
just
through
it
when
suddenly
her
eyes
fell
on
her
mother
who
was
standing
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
stage
in
a
tragical
position
all
the
colour
had
gone
from
her
face
and
it
seemed
to
rosalie
that
each
moment
her
face
was
growing
whiter
and
more
deathlike
she
quite
forgot
the
words
she
was
saying
all
remembrance
of
them
faded
from
her
mind
she
came
to
a
sudden
stop
her
promptings
were
all
in
vain
she
could
hear
nothing
he
said
she
could
see
nothing
but
her
mother
sorrowful
and
ghastly
face
and
then
her
mother
fell
and
some
of
the
actors
carried
her
from
the
room
rosalie
rushed
forward
to
follow
her
and
the
noise
in
the
theatre
became
deafening
but
she
was
stopped
on
the
stairs
by
her
father
who
blamed
her
most
cruelly
for
breaking
down
in
her
part
and
ordered
her
to
return
immediately
and
finish
accompanying
his
command
with
most
awful
threatenings
if
she
refused
to
obey
poor
little
rosalie
went
on
with
her
recital
trembling
in
every
limb
her
mother
place
was
taken
by
another
actor
and
the
play
went
on
as
before
but
rosalie
heart
was
not
there
it
was
filled
with
a
terrible
sickening
dread
what
had
become
of
her
mother
who
was
with
her
were
they
taking
care
of
her
and
then
a
horrible
fear
came
over
her
lest
her
mother
should
be
dead
lest
when
she
went
into
the
caravan
again
she
should
only
see
her
mother
body
stretched
upon
the
bed
lest
she
should
never
never
hear
her
mother
speak
to
her
again
as
soon
as
the
play
was
over
she
went
up
to
her
father
and
in
spite
of
the
annoyed
expression
of
his
face
begged
him
to
allow
her
to
leave
the
theatre
and
to
go
to
her
mother
but
he
told
her
angrily
that
she
had
spoilt
his
profits
quite
enough
for
one
night
and
she
must
take
care
how
she
dared
to
do
so
again
oh
what
a
long
night
that
seemed
to
rosalie
when
they
went
out
on
the
platform
between
the
performances
she
gazed
earnestly
in
the
direction
of
her
mother
caravan
a
light
seemed
to
be
burning
inside
but
more
than
that
rosalie
could
not
see
it
seemed
as
if
the
long
hours
would
never
pass
away
each
time
she
went
through
her
recital
she
felt
glad
that
she
had
at
least
once
less
to
say
it
each
time
that
the
town
hall
clock
struck
she
counted
the
hours
before
the
theatre
would
close
and
yet
when
all
was
over
and
when
rosalie
was
at
length
allowed
to
return
to
the
caravan
she
hardly
dared
to
enter
it
what
would
she
find
within
was
her
mother
dead
and
was
her
father
hiding
it
from
her
till
her
part
was
over
lest
she
should
break
down
again
very
very
gently
she
opened
the
door
there
was
a
candle
burning
on
the
table
and
by
its
light
rosalie
could
see
her
mother
lying
on
the
bed
she
was
very
pale
and
her
eyes
were
tightly
closed
but
she
was
breathing
she
was
not
dead
the
relief
was
so
great
that
rosalie
burst
into
tears
when
she
first
came
into
the
caravan
she
thought
that
her
mother
was
alone
but
a
small
hoarse
whisper
came
from
the
corner
of
the
caravan
be
frightened
my
dear
said
the
voice
only
me
toby
told
me
about
your
mother
and
so
i
came
to
sit
with
her
till
you
came
rosalie
walked
to
her
mother
side
and
on
the
box
by
the
bed
she
found
a
little
creature
about
three
feet
high
with
a
very
old
and
wrinkled
face
are
you
said
rosalie
belong
to
the
dwarf
show
my
dear
said
the
old
woman
are
four
of
us
there
and
not
one
of
us
more
than
three
feet
high
is
it
going
on
said
rosalie
it
going
on
my
dear
it
always
goes
on
said
the
tiny
old
woman
but
i
old
and
ugly
you
see
so
i
can
be
better
spared
than
the
others
i
only
go
in
sometimes
my
dear
old
age
must
have
its
liberties
you
see
you
so
much
for
taking
care
of
my
mother
said
rosalie
she
spoken
to
you
yet
my
dear
said
the
old
woman
spoke
once
but
i
could
well
hear
what
she
said
i
tried
to
reach
up
near
to
her
mouth
to
listen
but
you
see
i
only
three
feet
high
so
i
could
quite
manage
it
i
thought
it
was
something
about
a
sheep
but
of
course
it
could
be
that
my
dear
there
are
no
sheep
here
yes
said
rosalie
would
be
it
we
had
been
reading
about
sheep
before
we
went
into
the
theatre
just
then
a
noise
was
heard
at
the
door
of
the
caravan
and
augustus
entered
he
went
up
to
his
wife
and
felt
her
pulse
then
he
muttered
all
right
now
let
her
have
a
good
sleep
that
all
she
wants
rosalie
he
looked
curiously
at
the
dwarf
and
then
left
the
caravan
and
shut
the
door
said
the
tiny
old
woman
when
he
had
gone
stop
with
you
if
you
like
would
you
said
little
rosalie
should
be
so
glad
she
felt
as
if
she
could
not
bear
all
those
long
dark
hours
alone
beside
her
unconscious
mother
said
the
dwarf
stay
only
you
must
go
and
tell
them
in
our
tent
can
you
find
it
do
you
think
is
it
said
rosalie
the
little
old
woman
described
the
situation
of
the
tent
and
rosalie
put
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
went
in
search
of
it
there
were
some
stalls
still
lighted
up
and
the
flaring
naphtha
showed
rosalie
an
immense
picture
hanging
over
the
tent
representing
a
number
of
diminutive
men
and
women
and
above
the
picture
there
was
a
board
on
which
was
written
in
large
letters
royal
show
of
dwarfs
rosalie
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
the
entrance
to
this
show
she
groped
round
it
several
times
pulling
at
the
canvas
in
different
places
but
all
to
no
purpose
then
she
heard
voices
within
laughing
and
talking
going
as
near
to
these
as
possible
she
put
her
mouth
to
a
hole
in
the
canvas
and
called
out
will
you
let
me
in
i
brought
a
message
from
the
little
lady
that
lives
here
there
was
a
great
shuffling
in
the
tent
after
this
and
a
clinking
and
chinking
of
money
then
a
piece
of
the
canvas
was
pulled
aside
and
a
little
squeaky
voice
called
out
in
whoever
you
are
and
let
us
hear
what
you
got
to
say
so
rosalie
crept
in
through
the
canvas
and
stepped
into
the
middle
of
the
tent
it
was
a
curious
scene
which
she
saw
when
she
looked
round
three
little
dwarfs
stood
before
her
dressed
in
the
most
extraordinary
costumes
and
far
above
over
their
heads
there
towered
a
tall
and
very
thin
giant
not
one
of
the
tiny
dwarfs
came
up
to
his
elbow
on
the
floor
were
scattered
tiny
tables
diminutive
chairs
and
dolls
umbrellas
which
the
little
people
had
been
using
in
their
performance
is
it
my
dear
said
the
giant
loftily
as
rosalie
entered
said
rosalie
brought
a
message
from
the
little
lady
that
belongs
to
this
show
manikin
said
one
of
the
dwarfs
in
an
explanatory
tone
mother
manikin
repeated
the
giant
and
the
two
other
dwarfs
nodded
their
heads
in
assent
mother
very
ill
said
rosalie
she
taking
care
of
her
and
she
going
to
stay
all
night
and
i
was
to
tell
you
right
said
the
giant
majestically
right
all
right
all
right
echoed
the
three
little
dwarfs
then
the
two
lady
dwarfs
seized
rosalie
by
the
hand
and
wanted
her
to
sit
down
and
have
supper
with
them
but
rosalie
steadily
declined
she
must
not
leave
her
mother
nor
mother
manikin
right
said
the
giant
in
a
superior
voice
right
child
right
child
quite
right
repeated
the
three
little
dwarfs
then
they
escorted
rosalie
to
the
door
of
the
show
and
bowed
her
gracefully
out
mother
manikin
not
to
come
home
in
daylight
called
the
giant
as
rosalie
was
disappearing
through
the
canvas
no
said
the
three
dwarfs
in
daylight
not
said
rosalie
pennies
said
the
giant
mysteriously
our
pennies
and
halfpennies
for
seeing
the
show
repeated
the
dwarfs
must
not
make
ourselves
too
cheap
child
said
the
giant
child
said
the
dwarfs
sorrowful
as
she
was
they
almost
made
rosalie
smile
they
were
such
tiny
little
creatures
to
call
her
in
that
superior
manner
but
she
hastened
back
to
the
caravan
and
after
telling
mother
manikin
that
she
had
delivered
her
message
to
her
friends
she
took
up
her
place
by
her
side
it
was
a
great
comfort
having
little
mother
manikin
there
she
was
so
kind
and
considerate
so
thoughtful
and
clever
and
she
always
seemed
to
know
exactly
what
was
wanted
though
rosalie
mother
was
too
weak
to
ask
for
anything
all
night
long
the
poor
woman
lay
still
sometimes
entirely
unconscious
at
other
times
opening
her
eyes
and
trying
to
smile
at
poor
little
rosalie
who
was
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
mother
manikin
did
everything
that
had
to
be
done
she
was
evidently
accustomed
to
a
sickroom
and
knew
the
best
way
of
making
those
she
nursed
comfortable
she
climbed
on
a
chair
and
arranged
the
pillows
so
that
the
sick
woman
could
breathe
most
easily
and
after
a
time
she
made
the
poor
tired
child
take
off
her
white
dress
and
lie
down
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
wrapped
in
a
woollen
shawl
and
in
a
few
minutes
rosalie
fell
asleep
when
she
awoke
the
grey
light
was
stealing
in
at
the
caravan
window
she
raised
herself
on
the
bed
and
looked
round
at
first
she
thought
she
was
dreaming
but
presently
the
recollection
of
the
night
before
came
back
to
her
there
was
her
mother
sleeping
quietly
on
the
bed
and
there
was
little
mother
manikin
sitting
faithfully
at
her
post
never
having
allowed
herself
to
sleep
all
that
long
night
lest
the
sick
woman
should
wake
and
want
something
which
she
could
not
get
mother
manikin
said
rosalie
getting
down
from
the
bed
and
throwing
her
arms
round
the
little
old
woman
neck
good

are
child
said
the
dwarf

mother

sleeping
so
peacefully

rosalie

glad

though
he
has
hurt
himself
very
much
in
looking

the
little
old
woman

the
dwarf
nodded
her
head
in
assent
ask
him
every
day
to
find
us
mother
manikin
mammie
and
me
and
the
story
says

read
it
to
you

what

and
i
were
reading
before
we
went
in
to
the
play
rosalie
went
to
the
box
and
brought
out
the
little
black
testament
and
then
sitting
at
mother
manikin
feet
she
read
her
favourite
story
of
the
lost
sheep
he
found
you
mother
manikin
she
said
as
she
closed
the
book
the
little
dwarf
put
her
head
on
one
side
and
smoothed
her
tiny
grey
curls
but
made
no
answer
rosalie
was
almost
afraid
she
had
vexed
her
and
did
not
like
to
say
anything
more
but
a
long
time
afterwards
so
long
that
rosalie
had
been
thinking
of
a
dozen
things
since
mother
manikin
answered
her
question
and
said
in
a
strange
whisper
child
he
found
you
ask
him
dear
mother
manikin
said
rosalie
child
i
begin
said
the
little
dwarf
begin
now
if
you
say
the
words
for
me
rosalie
slipped
down
from
her
stool
and
kneeling
on
the
floor
of
the
caravan
she
said
aloud
good
shepherd
you
are
looking
for
mammie
and
me
please
look
for
mother
manikin
too
and
please
put
her
on
your
shoulder
and
carry
her
home
amen
said
old
mother
manikin
in
her
hoarse
whisper
she
did
not
talk
any
more
after
this
about
six
there
came
a
rap
on
the
caravan
door
and
a
woman
in
a
long
cloak
appeared
asking
if
mother
manikin
were
there
she
belonged
to
the
royal
show
of
dwarfs
and
she
had
come
to
take
mother
manikin
home
before
the
business
of
the
commenced
some
men
were
already
passing
by
to
their
work
so
the
woman
wrapped
mother
manikin
in
a
shawl
and
carried
her
home
like
a
baby
covering
her
with
her
cloak
so
that
no
one
should
see
who
she
was
rosalie
thanked
her
with
tears
in
her
eyes
for
all
her
kindness
and
the
little
woman
promised
soon
to
come
again
and
see
how
her
patient
was
chapter
ix
the
doctor
visit
rosalie
was
not
long
alone
after
mother
manikin
left
her
there
was
a
rap
at
the
door
and
on
opening
it
she
found
toby
rosie
he
said
is
she
now
think
she
is
sleeping
quietly
toby
said
rosalie
would
have
come
before
but
i
was
afraid
of
disturbing
her
said
toby
been
thinking
of
her
all
night
i
did
get
many
winks
of
sleep
miss
rosie
toby
was
it
you
that
fetched
little
mother
manikin
miss
rosie
i
used
to
belong
to
their
show
before
i
came
to
master
and
once
i
had
a
fever
and
mother
manikin
nursed
me
all
the
time
i
had
it
so
i
knew
she
would
know
what
to
do
a
kind
little
thing
said
rosalie
missie
she
has
only
got
a
little
body
but
there
a
great
kind
heart
inside
it
but
miss
rosie
i
wanted
to
tell
you
something
i
going
to
fetch
a
doctor
to
see
missis
toby
but
what
will
my
father
say
he
that
has
sent
me
miss
rosie
you
see
i
think
he
ashamed
you
should
have
seen
the
men
last
night
when
they
were
shutting
up
the
theatre
after
you
had
gone
away
they
went
up
to
master
and
gave
him
a
bit
of
their
minds
about
letting
missis
come
on
the
stage
when
she
was
so
ill
they
told
him
it
was
a
sin
and
a
shame
the
way
he
treated
her
taking
less
care
of
her
than
if
she
were
one
of
his
old
horses
not
that
he
over
and
above
good
to
them
neither
well
master
did
like
it
miss
rosie
and
he
was
very
angry
at
the
time
but
this
morning
as
soon
as
it
was
light
he
told
me
to
get
up
at
seven
and
fetch
a
doctor
to
see
missis
at
once
so
i
thought
i
better
tell
you
miss
rosie
that
you
might
put
things
straight
before
he
comes
as
soon
as
toby
had
gone
rosalie
put
the
caravan
in
order
and
awaited
anxiously
the
doctor
arrival
her
father
brought
him
in
and
stayed
in
the
caravan
whilst
he
felt
the
poor
woman
pulse
and
asked
rosalie
several
questions
about
her
cough
which
from
time
to
time
was
so
distressing
then
they
went
out
together
and
little
rosalie
was
left
in
suspense
she
had
not
dared
to
ask
the
doctor
what
he
thought
of
her
mother
when
her
father
was
present
and
her
little
heart
was
full
of
anxious
fear
augustus
came
in
soon
after
the
doctor
had
left
and
rosalie
crept
up
to
him
and
asked
what
he
had
said
of
her
mother
says
she
is
very
ill
said
her
father
shortly
and
in
a
voice
which
told
rosalie
that
she
must
ask
no
more
questions
and
then
he
sat
down
beside
the
bed
for
about
half
an
hour
and
looked
more
softened
than
rosalie
had
ever
seen
him
before
she
was
sure
the
doctor
must
have
told
him
that
her
mother
was
very
bad
indeed
rosalie
father
did
not
speak
there
was
no
sound
in
the
caravan
but
the
ticking
of
the
little
clock
which
was
fastened
to
a
nail
in
the
corner
and
the
occasional
falling
of
the
cinders
in
the
ashpan
augustus
reflections
were
not
pleasant
as
he
sat
by
his
wife
dying
bed
for
the
doctor
had
told
him
she
would
never
be
better
and
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
how
long
she
would
live
and
when
augustus
heard
that
all
his
cruel
treatment
came
back
to
his
mind
the
hard
words
he
had
spoken
to
her
the
unkind
things
he
had
said
of
her
and
above
all
the
way
in
which
he
had
made
her
come
on
the
stage
the
night
before
when
she
was
almost
too
ill
to
stand
all
these
things
crowded
in
upon
his
memory
and
a
short
fit
of
remorse
seized
him
it
was
this
which
led
him
contrary
to
his
custom
to
come
into
the
caravan
and
sit
by
her
side
but
his
meditations
became
so
unpleasant
at
length
that
he
could
bear
them
no
longer
he
could
not
sit
there
and
face
the
accusations
of
his
conscience
so
he
jumped
up
hastily
and
went
out
without
saying
a
word
to
his
child
slammed
the
little
caravan
door
after
him
and
sauntered
down
the
marketplace
here
he
met
some
of
his
friends
who
rallied
him
on
his
melancholy
appearance
and
offered
to
treat
him
to
a
glass
in
the
nearest
and
there
augustus
joyce
banished
all
thoughts
of
his
wife
and
stifled
the
loud
accusing
voice
of
his
conscience
when
he
returned
to
the
theatre
for
dinner
he
appeared
as
hard
and
selfish
as
ever
and
never
even
asked
how
his
wife
was
before
he
sat
down
to
eat
perhaps
he
dreaded
to
hear
the
answer
to
that
question
and
that
evening
rosalie
was
obliged
to
take
her
part
in
the
play
her
father
insisted
on
it
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
spare
her
he
said
and
to
fill
up
both
her
place
and
her
mother
also
rosalie
begged
him
most
earnestly
to
excuse
her
but
all
in
vain
so
with
an
aching
heart
she
went
to
the
royal
show
of
dwarfs
and
asked
for
mother
manikin
the
good
little
woman
was
indignant
when
rosalie
told
her
she
was
not
allowed
to
stay
with
her
mother
and
promised
immediately
to
come
and
sit
beside
the
poor
woman
in
her
absence
the
other
dwarfs
rather
grumbled
at
this
arrangement
but
mother
manikin
shook
her
little
fist
at
them
and
called
them
creatures
and
declared
that
old
age
must
have
its
liberties
she

combing
her
long

a
most
motherly

directly
she
was
the
quickest
little
body
rosalie
had
ever
seen

she
was
so
quiet
that
her
quick
movements
did
not
in
the
least
disturb
the
sick
woman
kind

said
rosalie
mother
as
the
dwarf

on
a
chair
to

tiny
old

to
you
i
heard
you
talking
about

the
little
old

of
that
rosalie

she
heard

she
not
so
bad
after

me

said
the
poor
woman
heard
rosalie
pray
said
mother
manikin
put
me
in
her
prayer
bless
her
i
forgotten
that
then
rosalie
mother
seemed
very
tired
and
her
careful
nurse
would
not
let
her
talk
any
more
but
made
her
lie
quite
quietly
without
moving
when
rosalie
left
her
to
go
on
the
stage
she
was
sleeping
peacefully
with
kind
mother
manikin
sitting
by
her
side
and
when
the
child
returned
late
at
night
there
she
was
sitting
still
and
she
insisted
on
undressing
and
creeping
into
bed
beside
her
mother
that
she
might
have
a
proper
night
rest
for
poor
little
rosalie
was
completely
exhausted
with
the
stifling
air
the
fatigue
and
the
anxiety
to
which
she
had
been
subjected
the
next
day
her
mother
seemed
to
have
revived
a
little
and
was
able
to
take
a
little
food
and
to
talk
to
her
in
whispers
from
time
to
time
she
said
that
afternoon
is
a
verse
come
back
to
me
which
our
old
nurse
taught
me
i
have
thought
of
it
for
years
but
that
night
when
i
was
so
ill
i
woke
saying
it
is
it
mammie
dear
said
rosalie
all
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray
we
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way
and
the
lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquity
of
us
all
that
was
it
dear
manikin
told
me
you
said
something
about
sheep
mammie
that
was
it
said
the
poor
woman
such
a
beautiful
verse
all
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray
that
just
like
me
darling
i
gone
astray
oh
so
far
astray
and
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way
that
me
again
my
own
way
that
just
what
it
was
i
chose
it
myself
i
would
have
my
own
way
it
just
like
me
rosalie
what
the
end
of
the
verse
mammie
dear
the
lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquity
of
us
all
that
means
jesus
the
lord
put
all
our
sins
on
him
when
he
died
on
the
cross
god
put
your
sins
on
jesus
mammie
dear
child
i
think
it
must
mean
mine
because
it
says
the
iniquity
of
us
all
i
think
all
must
take
me
in
rosalie
at
least
i
hope
so
i
have
been
asking
him
to
let
it
take
me
in
because
you
know
if
the
sin
is
laid
on
him
rosie
darling
i
have
to
bear
it
too
the
poor
woman
was
quite
exhausted
when
she
had
said
this
and
rosalie
brought
her
some
which
mother
manikin
had
made
for
her
and
which
was
simmering
on
the
stove
the
good
little
woman
came
once
more
to
stay
with
rosalie
mother
whilst
the
play
was
going
on
the
theatre
closed
rather
earlier
that
night
for
a
large
fair
was
to
be
held
at
a
town
some
way
off
at
which
augustus
joyce
was
very
anxious
to
be
present
and
as
he
did
not
think
there
was
much
more
to
be
done
in
lesborough
he
determined
to
start
at
once
so
the
moment
that
the
last
person
had
left
the
theatre
augustus
and
his
men
hastily
put
off
the
clothes
in
which
they
had
been
acting
slipped
on
their
working
coats
and
began
to
pull
down
the
scenery
all
night
long
they
were
hammering
and
knocking
down
and
packing
up
and
when
morning
dawned
they
were
ready
to
start
they
were
not
the
only
ones
who
had
been
packing
up
all
night
there
were
several
other
fairs
drawing
near
at
which
the
had
taken
ground
so
they
worked
away
as
those
who
had
no
time
to
lose
rosie
said
toby
voice
at
about
five
that

master
says
we
can
wait
a
bit
longer
to
give
missis
a
little
more
rest
he
and
the
other
men
are
going
off
at
once
to
get
the
theatre
set
up
and
everything

and
master
says

be
time
enough
if

first
night
of
the
fair
he
ca
do
without
you
then
he
says
am
very
glad
mammie
has
to
be
moved
just
yet
said
rosalie
shaking
would
hurt
her
so
much
i
sure
augustus
came
into
the
caravan
for
a
few
minutes
before
he
set
off
he
told
rosalie
that
they
might
stay
two
days
longer
but
on
saturday
morning
they
must
be
off
early
so
as
to
get
into
the
town
on
sunday

have
you
away
from
the
play
in
this
town
rosalie
not
for
the
world
it
a
large
seaside
place
and
i
hope
to
make
a
pretty
penny
there
if
every
one
does
their
duty
said
his
wife
in
a
trembling
voice
you
stay
five
minutes
with
me
before
you
go
said
augustus
taking
out
his
watch
i
might
spare
five
minutes
but
you
must
be
quick
i
ought
to
be
off
by
now
darling
said
her
mother
me
and
your
father
alone
little
rosalie
went
down
the
steps
of
the
caravan
shutting
the
door
gently
behind
her
and
stood
watching
her
father
men
who
were
yoking
the
horses
in
the
waggons
and
tying
ropes
round
the
different
loads
to
prevent
anything
falling
off
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
her
mother
laid
her
hand
on
her
husband
arm
and
said
there
are
two
things
i
want
to
ask
you
before
i
die
are
they
said
the
man
shortly
crossing
his
legs
and
leaning
back
on
his
chair
first
is
augustus
that
you
will
find
a
home
for
rosalie
when
dead
do
take
her
about
from
fair
to
fair
she
will
have
no
mother
to
take
care
of
her
and
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
her
being
left
here
all
alone
alone
said
augustus
angrily
will
have
me
she
will
be
all
right
if
i
here
and
i
not
going
to
let
the
child
go
just
when
beginning
to
be
useful
besides
where
would
you
have
her
go
rosalie
mother
did
not
tell
the
secret
hope
which
was
in
her
heart
thought
she
said
might
find
some
motherly
body
in
the
country
somewhere
who
would
take
care
of
her
for
very
little
money
and
would
send
her
to
school
regularly
and
see
she
was
brought
up
properly
nonsense
said
augustus
will
be
all
right
with
me
and
i
not
going
to
lose
a
pretty
child
like
that
from
the
stage
why
half
the
people
come
to
see
the
lovely
little
actress
as
they
call
her
i
know
better
than
to
spoil
her
for
acting
by
putting
her
down
in
some
slow
country
place
well
the
five
minutes
are
up
said
augustus
looking
at
his
watch
must
be
off
was
something
else
i
wanted
to
ask
you
augustus
what
is
it
be
quick
wanted
to
tell
you
that
the
last
fortnight
i
have
been
feeling
that
when
one
comes
to
die
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
worth
having
except
to
know
that
your
soul
is
safe
i
led
a
wicked
life
augustus
i
often
been
disagreeable
and
bad
to
you
but
all
my
desire
now
is
that
the
good
shepherd
should
seek
me
and
find
me
before
it
is
too
late
that
all
said
her
husband
putting
on
his
coat
augustus
i
wanted
to
ask
you
something
are
ready
to
die
time
enough
to
think
of
that
said
her
husband
with
a
laugh
yet
there
was
an
uneasy
expression
in
his
face
as
he
said
it
which
showed
that
the
answer
to
the
question
was
not
a
satisfactory
one
augustus
you
do
know
how
long
there
may
be
said
his
poor
wife
sorrowfully
said
he
life
so
short
we
must
get
all
the
play
we
can
out
of
it
what
of
the
other
life
augustus
the
long
life
that
coming
that
may
take
care
of
itself
said
her
husband
scornfully
as
he
lighted
his
pipe
at
the
stove
and
wishing
his
wife
a
pleasant
journey
he
went
down
the
steps
of
the
caravan
and
closed
the
door
the
poor
wife
turned
over
on
her
pillow
and
wept
she
had
made
a
very
great
effort
in
speaking
to
her
husband
and
it
had
been
of
no
avail
she
was
so
spent
and
exhausted
that
had
it
not
been
for
mother
manikin
which
rosalie
gave
her
as
soon
as
she
came
in
she
must
have
fainted
from
very
weariness
a
few
minutes
afterwards
the
waggons
rumbled
past
the
theatre
party
set
off
on
their
journey
and
rosalie
and
her
mother
were
left
alone
chapter
x
britannia
all
day
long
the
packing
up
went
on
and
one
by
one
the
shows
moved
off
and
the
became
more
empty
in
the
afternoon
toby
came
to
the
caravan
to
inform
rosalie
that
the
show
of
dwarfs
was
just
going
to
start
and
mother
manikin
wanted
to
say
to
her
you
thank
her
rosalie
said
the
sick
woman
give
her
my
love
mammie
dear
said
the
child
wo
forget
she
found
the
four
little
dwarfs
sitting
in
a
tiny
covered
waggon
in
which
they
were
to
take
their
journey
rosalie
was
cautiously
admitted
and
the
door
closed
carefully
after
her
mother
manikin
took
leave
of
her
with
tears
in
her
eyes
they
were
not
going
to
the
same
fair
as
father
and
she
did
not
know
when
they
would
meet
again
she
gave
rosalie
very
particular
directions
about
the
and
slipped
in
her
pocket
a
tiny
parcel
which
she
told
her
to
give
to
her
mother
and
then
she
whispered
in
rosalie
ear
have
forgotten
to
ask
the
good
shepherd
to
find
me
child
and
you
leave
me
out
my
dear
when
you
say
your
prayers
at
night
mother
manikin
said
master
puck
must
be
off
mother
manikin
shook
her
fist
at
him
saying
age
must
have
its
liberties
and
young
things
should
not
be
so
impatient
then
she
put
her
little
arms
round
rosalie
neck
and
kissed
and
hugged
her
and
the
three
other
dwarfs
insisted
on
kissing
her
too
and
as
soon
as
rosalie
had
gone
the
signal
was
given
for
their
departure
and
the
show
of
dwarfs
left
the
rosalie
ran
home
to
her
mother
and
gave
her
mother
manikin
parcel
there
were
several
paper
wrappings
which
the
child
took
off
one
by
one
and
then
came
an
envelope
inside
which
was
a
piece
of
money
she
took
it
out
and
held
it
up
to
her
mother
it
was
a
good
little
mother
manikin
she
had
taken
that
from
her
small
bag
of
savings
and
she
had
put
it
in
that
envelope
with
even
a
gladder
heart
than
rosalie
mother
had
when
she
received
it
rosalie
said
the
sick
woman
can
have
some
more
now
said
the
child
get
the
meat
at
once
and
it
was
not
only
at
her
evening
prayer
that
rosalie
mentioned
mother
manikin
name
that
day
it
was
not
only
then
that
she
knelt
down
to
ask
the
good
shepherd
to
seek
and
to
save
little
mother
manikin
all
day
long
rosalie
sat
by
her
mother
side
watching
her
tenderly
and
carefully
and
trying
to
imitate
mother
manikin
in
the
way
she
arranged
her
pillows
and
waited
upon
her
and
when
evening
came
the
large
square
was
quite
deserted
except
by
the
scavengers
who
were
going
from
one
end
to
another
sweeping
up
the
rubbish
which
had
been
left
behind
by
the
showmen
rosalie
felt
very
lonely
the
next
day
toby
had
slept
at
an
inn
in
the
town
and
was
out
all
day
at
a
village
some
miles
off
to
which
his
master
had
sent
him
to
procure
something
he
wanted
at
a
sale
there
the
was
quite
empty
and
no
one
came
near
the
one
solitary
caravan
no
one
except
an
officer
of
the
board
of
health
to
inquire
what
was
the
cause
of
the
delay
and
whether
the
sick
woman
was
suffering
from
any
infectious
complaint
people
passed
down
the
and
went
to
the
various
shops
but
no
one
came
near
rosalie
and
her
mother
the
sick
woman
slept
the
greater
part
of
the
day
and
spoke
very
little
but
every
now
and
then
the
child
heard
her
repeat
to
herself
the
last
verse
of
her
little
hymn
i
come
without
delaying
to
thine
arms
at
once
i
flee
lest
no
more
i
hear
thee
saying
come
come
to
me
and
then
night
came
and
rosalie
sat
by
her
mother
side
for
she
did
not
like
to
go
to
sleep
lest
she
should
awake
and
want
something
and
oh
what
a
long
night
it
seemed
the
town
hall
clock
struck
the
quarters
but
that
was
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
stillness
rosalie
kept
a
light
burning
and
every
now
and
then
mended
the
little
fire
that
the
might
be
ready
whenever
her
mother
wanted
it
and
many
times
she
gazed
at
her
picture
and
wished
she
were
the
little
lamb
safe
in
the
good
arms
for
she
felt
weary
and
tired
and
longed
for
rest
the
next
morning
the
child
heard
toby
voice
as
soon
as
it
was
light
rosie
he
said
i
come
in
for
a
minute
rosalie
opened
the
door
and
toby
was
much
distressed
to
see
how
ill
and
tired
she
looked
must
make
yourself
ill
miss
rosie
you
really
must
he
said
reproachfully
try
not
toby
said
the
child
the
country
air
will
do
me
good
missie
maybe
it
will
i
think
we
better
start
at
once
because
i
do
want
to
go
fast
the
slower
we
go
the
better
it
will
be
for
missis
and
then
we
will
stop
somewhere
for
the
night
if
we
come
to
a
village
we
can
stop
there
and
i
get
a
hole
in
some
barn
to
creep
into
or
if
there
no
village
convenient
there
sure
to
be
a
haystack
i
slept
on
a
haystack
before
this
miss
rosie
in
about
half
an
hour
toby
had
made
all
ready
and
they
left
the
very
slowly
and
carefully
he
drove
yet
the
shaking
tried
rosalie
mother
much
her
cough
was
exceedingly
troublesome
and
her
breathing
was
very
bad
she
was
obliged
to
be
propped
up
with
pillows
and
even
then
she
could
hardly
breathe
the
child
opened
the
caravan
door
and
every
now
and
then
spoke
to
toby
who
was
sitting
just
underneath
it
he
did
not
whistle
to
day
nor
call
out
to
his
horse
but
seemed
very
thoughtful
and
quiet
towards
evening
rosalie
mother
fell
asleep
such
a
sweet
peaceful
sleep
it
was
that
the
child
could
but
wish
it
to
continue
it
made
her
so
glad
to
hear
the
coughing
cease
and
the
breathing
become
more
regular
and
she
dreaded
lest
any
jolting
of
the
cart
should
awake
her
and
make
her
start
up
again
do
you
think
of
stopping
here
for
the
night
miss
rosie
said
toby
they
had
come
to
a
very
quiet
and
solitary
place
on
the
borders
of
a
large
moor
a
great
stretched
on
one
side
of
them
and
the
trees
looked
dark
and
solemn
in
the
fading
light
at
the
edge
of
this
wood
was
a
stone
wall
against
which
toby
drew
up
the
caravan
that
it
might
be
sheltered
from
the
wind
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
was
the
moor
stretching
on
for
miles
and
miles
and
on
this
moor
in
a
little
sheltered
corner
surrounded
by
toby
had
determined
to
sleep
shall
be
close
by
miss
rosie
he
said
sleep
pretty
sound
but
if
only
you
call
out
toby
i
shall
be
at
your
side
in
a
twinkling
i
always
wake
in
a
trice
when
i
hear
my
name
called
you
wo
be
frightened
miss
rosie
will
you
said
rosalie
think
not
but
she
gazed
rather
fearfully
down
the
road
at
the
corner
of
which
they
had
drawn
up
the
trees
were
throwing
dark
shadows
across
the
path
and
their
branches
were
waving
gloomily
in
the
evening
breeze
rosalie
shivered
a
little
as
she
looked
at
them
and
at
the
dark
behind
her
tell
you
what
miss
rosie
said
toby
as
he
finished
eating
his
supper
sit
on
the
steps
of
the
caravan
if
you
are
frightened
at
all
no
no
never
you
mind
me
i
shall
be
all
right
one
night
sitting
up
wo
hurt
me
but
rosalie
would
not
allow
it
she
insisted
on
toby
going
to
sleep
on
the
heather
and
made
him
take
her
mother
warm
shawl
that
he
might
wrap
himself
in
it
for
illustration
on
the
moor
blank
page
it
was
a
very
cold
night
then
she
carefully
bolted
the
caravan
door
closed
the
windows
and
crept
to
her
sleeping
mother
side
she
sat
on
the
bed
put
her
head
on
the
pillow
and
tried
to
sleep
also
but
the
intense
stillness
was
oppressive
and
made
her
head
ache
for
she
kept
sitting
up
in
the
bed
to
listen
and
to
strain
her
ears
longing
for
any
sound
to
break
the
silence
yet
when
a
sound
come
when
the
wind
swept
over
the
and
made
the
branches
which
hung
over
the
caravan
creak
and
sway
to
and
fro
rosalie
trembled
with
fear
poor
child
the
want
of
sleep
the
last
few
nights
was
telling
on
her
and
had
made
her
nervous
and
sensitive
at
last
she
found
the
matches
and
lighted
a
candle
that
she
might
not
feel
quite
so
lonely
then
she
took
her
testament
from
the
box
and
began
to
read
as
she
read
little
rosalie
felt
no
longer
alone
she
had
a
strange
realisation
of
the
good
shepherd
presence
and
a
wonderful
feeling
that
her
prayer
was
heard
and
that
he
was
indeed
carrying
her
in
his
bosom
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
she
would
have
screamed
with
horror
when
about
an
hour
afterwards
there
came
a
tap
at
the
caravan
door
rosalie
jumped
from
her
seat
and
peeped
out
between
the
muslin
curtains
she
could
just
see
a
dark
figure
crouching
on
the
caravan
steps
it
you
toby
she
said
opening
the
window
cautiously
it
me
said
a
girl
voice
you
got
a
fire
in
there
are
you
said
rosalie
fearfully
tell
you
when
i
get
in
said
the
girl
me
come
and
warm
myself
by
your
fire
rosalie
did
not
know
what
to
do
she
did
not
much
like
opening
the
door
for
how
could
she
tell
who
this
stranger
might
be
she
had
almost
determined
to
call
toby
when
the
sound
of
sobbing
made
her
change
her
mind
the
matter
she
said
addressing
the
girl
cold
and
hungry
and
miserable
she
said
with
a
sob
i
saw
your
light
and
i
thought
you
would
let
me
in
rosalie
hesitated
no
longer
she
unbolted
the
door
and
the
dark
figure
on
the
steps
came
in
she
threw
off
a
long
cloak
with
which
she
was
covered
and
rosalie
could
see
that
she
was
quite
a
young
girl
about
seventeen
years
old
and
that
she
had
been
crying
until
her
eyes
were
swollen
and
red
she
was
as
cold
as
ice
there
seemed
to
be
no
feeling
in
her
hands
and
her
teeth
chattered
as
she
sat
down
on
the
bench
by
the
side
of
the
stove
rosalie
put
some
cold
tea
into
a
little
pan
and
made
it
hot
and
when
the
girl
had
drunk
this
she
seemed
better
and
more
inclined
to
talk
that
your
mother
she
said
glancing
at
the
bed
where
rosalie
mother
was
still
sleeping
peacefully
said
rosalie
in
a
whisper
must
wake
her
she
is
very
very
that
why
we
did
start
with
the
rest
of
the
company
and
the
doctor
has
given
her
some
medicine
to
make
her
sleep
whilst
travelling
have
a
mother
said
the
girl
you
said
rosalie
is
she
but
the
girl
did
not
answer
this
question
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
began
to
cry
again
rosalie
looked
at
her
very
sorrowfully
wish
you
would
tell
me
the
matter
she
said
who
you
are
britannia
said
the
girl
without
looking
up
repeated
rosalie
in
a
puzzled
voice
do
you
mean
were
at
lesborough
were
you
said
the
girl
we
just
come
from
lesborough
did
you
see
the
circus

rosalie

us
on
the
road
as
we
were

the
girl

me
on
the
top
of
the
last
car

had
a
white
dress
on
and
a
scarlet
scarf
said
rosalie

and
a
great
fork
in
your
hand
they
called
it
a
trident
and
they
called
me
britannia
what
are
you

here
asked
the
child
run
away
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
i
going
home

said
rosalie
a
long
way
off
she
said
do
suppose
i
shall
ever
get
there
i
have
a
penny
in
my
pocket
and
i
tired
out
already
i
been
walking
all
night
and
all
day
then
she
began
to
cry
again
and
sobbed
so
loudly
that
rosalie
was
afraid
she
would
awake
and
alarm
her
mother
britannia
she
said
cry
tell
me
what
the
matter
me
by
my
own
name
said
the
girl
with
another
sob
not
britannia
now
i
jessie
little
jess
my
mother
always
calls
me
and
at
the
mention
of
her
mother
she
cried
again
as
if
her
heart
would
break
said
rosalie
laying
her
hand
on
her
arm
you
tell
me
about
it
the
girl
stopped
crying
and
as
soon
as
she
was
calmer
she
told
rosalie
her
story
got
such
a
good
mother
it
that
which
made
me
cry
she
said
mother
is
in
the
circus
then
is
she
said
rosalie
no
said
the
girl
and
she
almost
smiled
through
her
tears
such
a
sad
sorrowful
attempt
at
a
smile
it
was
do
know
my
mother
or
you
would
ask
that
no
she
lives
in
a
village
a
long
way
from
here
going
to
her
at
least
i
think
i
am
i
do

if
i
dare
not
said
rosalie
you
frightened
of
your
mother
i
not

of
her
said
the
girl
i
been
so
bad
to
her
i
almost
ashamed
to
go
back
she
does
know
where
i
am
now
i
expect
she
has
had
no
sleep
since
i
ran
away
did
you
run
away
asked
the
child
will
be
three
weeks
ago
now
said
jessie
mournfully
it
seems
more
like
three
months
i
never
was
so
wretched
in
all
my
life
before
cried
myself
to
sleep
every
night
made
you
leave
your
mother
said
rosalie
was
that
circus
it
came
to
the
next
town
to
where
we
lived
all
the
girls
in
the
village
were
going
to
it
and
i
wanted
to
go
with
them
and
my
mother
would
let
me
not
said
i
should
get
no
good
there
that
there
were
a
great
many
bad
people
went
to
such
places
and
i
was
better
away
how
did
you
see
it
said
rosalie
did
see
it
that
day
and
at
night
the
girls
came
home
and
told
me
all
about
it
and
what
a
fine
procession
it
was
and
how
the
ladies
were
dressed
in
silver
and
gold
and
the
gentlemen
in
shining
armour
and
then
i
almost
cried
with
disappointment
because
i
had
not
seen
it
too
the
girls
said
it
would
be
in
the
town
one
more
day
and
then
it
was
going
away
and
when
i
got
into
bed
that
night
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
go
and
have
a
look
at
it
the
next
day
did
your
mother
let
you
said
rosalie
i
knew
it
was
no
use
asking
her
i
meant
to
slip
out
of
the
house
before
she
knew
anything
about
it
but
it
so
happened
that
that
day
she
was
called
away
to
the
next
village
to
see
my
aunt
who
was
did
you
go
when
she
was
out
i
did
said
jessie
i
told
her
a
lie
about
it
this
was
said
with
a
great
sob
and
the
poor
girl
tears
began
to
flow
again
did
you
say
asked
little
rosalie
said
to
me
before
she
went
little
jess
you
take
care
of
maggie
and
baby
wo
you
dear
you
not
let
any
harm
come
to
them
and
i
said
no
mother
i
wo
but
as
i
said
it
my
cheeks
turned
hot
and
i
felt
as
if
my
mother
must
see
how
they
were
burning
but
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
she
turned
back
and
kissed
me
and
kissed
little
maggie
and
the
baby
and
then
she
went
to
my
aunt
i
watched
her
out
of
sight
and
then
i
put
on
my
best
clothes
and
set
off
for
the
town
what
did
you
do
with
maggie
and
baby
said
rosalie
you
take
them
with
you
that
the
worst
of
it
said
the
girl
left
them
i
put
the
baby
in
its
crib
upstairs
and
i
told
maggie
to
look
after
it
and
then
i
put
the
table
in
front
of
the
fire
and
locked
them
in
and
put
the
key
in
the
window
i
thought
i
should
only
be
away
a
short
time
long
were
you
i
got
to
the
town
the
procession
was
just
passing
and
i
stopped
to
look
at
it
and
when
i
saw
the
men
and
women
sitting
upon
the
cars
i
thought
they
were
kings
and
queens
well
i
went
to
the
circus
and
saw
all
that
there
was
to
be
seen
and
then
i
looked
at
the
church
clock
and
found
it
was
five
for
the
exhibition
had
not
been
till
the
afternoon
i
knew
my
mother
would
be
home
and
i
did
not
like
to
go
back
i
wondered
what
she
would
say
to
me
about
leaving
the
children
so
i
walked
round
the
circus
for
some
time
looking
at
the
gilded
cars
which
were
drawn
up
in
the
field
and
as
i
was
looking
at
them
an
old
man
came
up
to
me
and
began
talking
to
me
he
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
the
circus
and
i
told
him
i
thought
it
splendid
then
he
asked
me
what
i
liked
best
and
i
said
those
ladies
in
gold
and
silver
who
were
sitting
on
the
gilt
cars
would
you
like
to
be
dressed
like
that
he
said
yes
that
i
should
i
said
as
i
looked
down
at
my
dress
my
best
sunday
dress
which
i
had
once
thought
so
smart
well
he
said
mysteriously
i
do
know
but
perhaps
i
may
get
you
that
chance
just
wait
here
a
minute
and
i
see
stood
there
trembling
hardly
knowing
what
to
wish
at
last
he
came
back
and
told
me
to
follow
him
he
took
me
into
a
room
and
there
i
found
a
very
grand
lady
at
least
she
looked
like
one
then
she
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
come
and
be
britannia
in
the
circus
and
ride
on
the
gilt
car
what
did
you
say
asked
rosalie
thought
it
was
a
great
chance
for
me
and
i
told
her
i
would
stay
i
was
so
excited
about
it
that
i
hardly
knew
where
i
was
it
seemed
just
as
if
some
one
was
asking
me
to
be
a
queen
and
it
was
not
till
i
got
into
bed
that
i
let
myself
think
of
my
mother
you
think
of
her
then
said
rosalie
i
could
help
thinking
of
her
then
but
there
were
six
or
seven
other
girls
in
the
room
and
i
was
afraid
of
them
hearing
me
cry
so
i
hid
my
face
under
the
bedclothes
the
next
day
we
moved
from
that
town
and
i
felt
very
miserable
all
the
time
we
were
travelling
then
the
circus
was
set
up
again
and
we
went
in
the
procession
you
like
that
asked
the
child
it
was
not
as
nice
as
i
expected
it
was
a
cold
day
and
the
white
dress
was
very
thin
and
oh
i
was
so
dizzy
on
that
car
it
was
such
a
height
up
and
i
felt
every
moment
as
if
i
should
fall
and
then
they
were
so
unkind
to
me
i
was
very
miserable
because
i
kept
thinking
of
my
mother
and
when
they
were
talking
and
laughing
i
used
to
cry
and
they
did
like
that
they
said
i
was
very
different
to
the
last
girl
they
had
she
had
left
them
to
be
married
and
they
were
looking
out
for
a
fresh
girl
when
they
met
with
me
they
thought
i
had
a
pretty
face
and
would
do
very
well
but
they
were
angry
with
me
for
looking
so
miserable
and
found
more
and
more
fault
with
me
they
were
always
quarrelling
long
after
we
went
to
bed
they
were
shouting
at
each
other
oh
i
got
so
tired
of
it
i
did
wish
i
had
never
left
home
and
then
we
came
to
lesborough
and
at
last
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
i
kept
dreaming
about
my
mother
and
when
i
woke
in
the
night
i
thought
i
heard
my
mother
voice
at
last
i
determined
to
run
away
i
knew
they
would
be
very
angry
but
no
money
could
make
me
put
up
with
that
sort
of
life
i
was
thoroughly
sick
of
it
i
felt
ill
and
weary
and
longed
for
my
mother
and
now
i
going
home
i
ran
away
the
night
they
left
lesborough
i
got
out
of
the
caravan
when
they
were
all
asleep
been

when

i
thought
about
that
so
often
then
the
poor
girl
seemed
very
tired
and
leaning
against
the
wall
she
fell
asleep
whilst
rosalie
rested
once
more
against
her
mother
pillow
and
again
there
was
no
sound
to
be
heard
but
the
wind
sweeping
among
the
dark
rosalie
was
glad
to
have
jessie
there
it
did
not
seem
quite
so
solitary
and
at
last
rest
was
given
to
the
tired
little
woman
her
eyes
closed
and
she
forgot
her
troubles
in
a
sweet
refreshing
sleep
chapter
xi
the
mother
dream
when
rosalie
awoke
her
mother
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
and
she
was
sitting
up
in
bed
her
breathing
was
very
painful
and
she
was
holding
her
hand
to
her
side
as
if
she
were
in
much
pain
the
candle
had
burnt
low
in
the
socket
and
the
early
morning
light
was
stealing
into
the
caravan
jessie
was
still
asleep
in
the
corner
with
her
head
leaning
against
the
wall
said
her
mother
under
her
breath
are
we
and
who
is
that
girl
to
the
town
mammie
out
on
a
moor
and
that
britannia
do

mean
asked
her
mother
the
girl
we
saw
riding
on
that
gilt
car
in
lesborough
and
she
has
run
away
she
was
so
miserable
there
and
then
rosalie
told
her
mother
the
sad
story
she
had
just
heard
thing
poor
young
thing
said
the
sick
woman
glad

took
her
in
mind

her
a
good
breakfast

does
well
to
go
back
to
her
mother
it
the
best
thing
she
can
do
is
she
asleep
rosalie
mammie
dear
she
went
to
sleep
before
i
did
you
think
it
would
wake
her
if
you
were
to
sing
to
me
mammie
dear
i
should
think
so
if
i
did
sing
very
loud
could
you
sing
me
your
hymn
once
more
i
had
the
tune
in
my
ears
all
night
and
i
should
so
much
like
to
hear
it
so
little
rosalie
sang
her
hymn
she
had
a
sweet
low
voice
and
she
sang
very
correctly
if
she
had
heard
a
tune
once
she
never
forgot
it
when
she
had
finished
singing
jessie
moved
and
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
up
with
a
smile
as
if
she
were
in
the
midst
of
a
pleasant
dream
then
as
she
saw
the
inside
of
the
caravan
the
sick
woman
and
rosalie
she
remembered
where
she
was
and
burst
into
tears
the
matter
said
the
child
running
up
to
her
and
putting
her
arms
round
her
neck
you
thinking
of
your
mother
dear
she
said
was
dreaming
her
what
she
was
dreaming
said
rosalie
mother
was
dreaming
i
was
at
home
and
it
was
sunday
and
we
were
at
the
and
singing
the
hymn
we
always
begin
with
i
was
singing
it
when
i
woke
and
it
made
me
cry
to
think
it
was
true
it
was
my
singing
that
made
you
dream
it
said
rosalie
been
singing
to
my
mammie
i
should
think
that
was
it
said
the
girl
did
you
sing
will
you
sing
it
to
me
rosalie
sang
over
again
the
first
verse
of
the
hymn
to
her
surprise
jessie
started
from
her
seat
and
seized
her
by
the
hand
did
you
get
that
she
asked
hurriedly
the
very
hymn
i
was
singing
in
my
dream
we
always
sing
it
on
sunday
afternoons
at
our
have
it
on
a
card
said
rosalie
bringing
her
favourite
card
down
from
the
wall
who
gave
you
that
said
the
girl
just
like
mine
mine
has
a
ribbon
in
it
just
that
colour
where
you
get
it
were
passing
through
a
village
said
rosalie
a
kind
woman
gave
it
to
me
we
stopped
there
about
an
hour
and
she
was
singing
it
outside
her
cottage
door
it
must
have
been
our
village
surely
said
jessie
do
think
they
have
those
cards
anywhere
else
what
was
the
woman
like
was
a
young
woman
with
a
very
nice
face
she
had
one
little
boy
about
two
years
old
and
he
was
playing
with
his
ball
in
front
of
the
house
his
mother
was
so
good
to
us
she
gave
us
some
bread
and
milk
it
must
have
been
mrs
barker
said
the
girl
lives
close
to
us
our
cottage
is
just
a
little
farther
up
the
road
she
often
sings
when
she
at
work
to
think
that
you
been
to
our
village
oh
i
wish
you
seen
my
mother
you
know
mrs
leslie
asked
the
sick
woman
raising
herself
in
bed
that
i
do
said
the
girl
our
clergyman
wife
such
a
kind
lady
oh
she
is
good
to
us
i
in
her
we
go
to
the
vicarage
every
sunday
afternoon
do
know
her
she
asked
turning
to
rosalie
mother
used
to
know
her
many
years
ago
said
the
sick
woman
it
a
long
long
time
since
i
saw
her
rosalie
crept
up
to
her
mother
side
and
put
her
little
hand
in
hers
for
she
knew
that
the
mention
of
her
sister
would
bring
back
all
the
sorrowful
memories
of
the
past
but
the
sick
woman
was
very
calm
to
day
she
did
not
seem
at
all
ruffled
or
disturbed
but
she
lay
looking
at
jessie
with
her
eyes
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
pleased
even
to
look
at
some
one
who
had
seen
her
sister
lucy
about
six
toby
came
to
the
caravan
door
and
asked
how
his
mistress
was
and
if
they
were
ready
to
start
he
was
very
surprised
when
he
saw
jessie
sitting
inside
the
caravan
but
rosalie
told
him
in
a
few
words
how
the
poor
girl
came
there
and
asked
him
in
what
direction
she
ought
to
walk
to
get
to
her
own
home
toby
was
very
clever
in
knowing
the
way
to
nearly
every
place
in
the
country
and
he
said
that
for
ten
miles
farther
their
roads
would
be
the
same
and
jessie
could
ride
with
them
in
the
caravan
the
poor
girl
was
very
grateful
to
them
for
all
their
kindness
she
sat
beside
rosalie
mother
all
the
morning
and
did
everything
she
could
for
her
the
effect
of
the
doctor
medicine
had
passed
off
and
the
sick
woman
was
very
restless
and
wakeful
she
was
burnt
with
fever
and
tossed
about
from
side
to
side
of
her
bed
every
now
and
then
her
mind
seemed
to
wander
and
she
talked
of
her
mother
and
her
sister
lucy
and
of
other
things
which
rosalie
did
not
understand
then
she
became
quite
sensible
and
would
repeat
over
and
over
again
the
words
of
the
hymn
or
would
ask
rosalie
to
read
to
her
once
more
about
the
lost
sheep
and
the
good
shepherd
when
the
child
had
read
the
parable
the
mother
turned
to
jessie
and
said
to
her
very
earnestly
do
ask
the
good
shepherd
to
find
you
now
jessie
you
be
so
glad
of
it
afterwards
been
so
bad
said
jessie
crying
mother
has
often
talked
to
me
and
leslie
has
too
and
yet
after
all
i
gone
and
done
this
i
dare
ever
ask
him
to
find
me
now
not
jessie
said
rosalie
mother
not
ask
him
he
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
now
said
the
girl
sobbing
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
i
only
gone
to
him
that
sunday
sunday
asked
rosalie
was
the
sunday
before
i
left
home
leslie
talked
to
us
so
beautifully
it
was
about
coming
to
jesus
she
asked
us
if
we
had
come
to
him
to
have
our
sins
forgiven
and
she
said
if
you
have
come
to
him
already
do
come
to
him
and
then
she
begged
those
of
us
who
come
to
him
before
to
go
home
when
the
class
was
over
and
kneel
down
in
our
own
rooms
and
ask
jesus
to
forgive
us
that
very
sunday
afternoon
i
knew
had
never
come
to
jesus
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
do
as
our
teacher
asked
us
but
as
soon
as
we
were
outside
the
vicarage
the
girls
began
talking
and
laughing
and
made
fun
of
somebody
bonnet
that
they
had
seen
at
church
that
morning
and
when
i
got
home
i
thought
no
more
of
coming
to
jesus
and
i
never
went
to
him
and
oh
i
wish
that
i
had
now
said
rosalie
mother
would
be
any
good
said
the
girl
sorrowfully
i
thought
it
would
if
i
only
thought
he
would
forgive
me
i
would
do
anything
i
would
walk
twice
the
distance
home
he
goeth
after
that
which
is
lost
until
he
find
it
said
the
sick
woman
lost
jessie
said
the
girl
just
what
i
am
he
is
going
after
you
said
rosalie
mother
again
jessie
walked
to
the
door
of
the
caravan
and
sat
looking
out
without
speaking
the
sunlight
was
streaming
on
the
purple
heather
which
was
spread
like
a
carpet
on
both
sides
of
the
road
quiet
little
roadside
springs
trickled
through
the
moss
and
ran
across
the
path
the
travellers
had
left
the
behind
and
there
was
not
a
single
tree
in
sight
nothing
but
large
grey
rocks
and
occasional
patches
of
bright
yellow
furze
amongst
the
miles
and
miles
of
moor
at
last
they
came
to
a
large
at
a
corner
where
four
roads
met
and
here
toby
said
jessie
must
leave
them
but
before
she
went
there
was
a
little
whispered
conversation
between
rosalie
and
her
mother
which
ended
in
jessie
carrying
away
in
her
pocket
no
less
than
half
of
mother
manikin
present
need
it
before
you
get
home
dear
said
the
sick
woman
mind
you
go
straight
to
your
mother
do
stop
till
you
run
right
into
her
arms
and
when
you
see
leslie
just
tell
her
you
met
with
a
poor
woman
in
a
caravan
called
norah
who
knew
her
many
years
ago
said
jessie
tell
her
say
that
i
sent
my
respects
my
love
to
her
and
tell
her
i
have
not
very
long
to
live
but
the
good
shepherd
has
sought
me
and
found
me
and
i
not
afraid
to
die
do
forget
to
tell
her
that
said
jessie
be
sure
to
remember
the
poor
girl
was
very
sorry
to
leave
them
she
kissed
rosalie
and
her
mother
many
times
and
as
she
went
down
the
road
she
kept
turning
round
to
wave
her
handkerchief
till
the
caravan
was
quite
out
of
sight
those
girls
knew
nothing
about
it
rosalie
darling
said
her
mother
when
jessie
was
gone
about
what
mammie
dear
you
remember
the
girls
that
stood
by
our
show
when
the
procession
went
past
they
wished
they
were
britannia
and
thought
she
must
be
so
happy
and
glad
yes
said
rosalie
knew
nothing
about
it
all
the
time
poor
jessie
was
so
miserable
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
herself
just
the
mistake
i
made
rosalie
darling
till
i
came
behind
the
scenes
and
knew
how
different
everything
looks
when
one
is
there
and
so
it
is
dear
with
everything
in
this
world
it
is
all
disappointing
and
vain
when
one
gets
to
know
it
well
as
evening
drew
on
they
left
the
moor
behind
and
turned
into
a
very
dark
and
shady
road
with
trees
on
both
sides
of
the
way
rosalie
mother
was
sleeping
for
the
first
time
since
early
morning
and
rosalie
sat
and
looked
out
at
the
door
of
the
caravan
the
wood
was
very
thick
and
the
long
shadows
of
the
trees
fell
across
the
road
every
now
and
then
they
disturbed
four
or
five
rabbits
that
were
enjoying
themselves
by
the
side
of
the
path
and
ran
headlong
into
their
snug
little
holes
as
soon
as
they
heard
the
creaking
of
the
caravan
wheels
then
an
owl
startled
rosalie
by
hooting
in
a
tree
overhead
and
then
several
cooed
mournfully
their
sad
the
road
was
full
of
turnings
and
wound
in
and
out
amongst
the
wood
toby
whistled
a
tune
as
he
went
along
and
rosalie
sat
and
listened
to
him
quite
glad
that
he
broke
the
silence
she
was
not
sorry
when
they
left
the
wood
behind
and
came
into
the
open
country
and
at
last
there
glimmered
in
the
distance
the
lights
of
a
village
where
toby
said
they
would
spend
the
night
he
pulled
up
the
caravan
by
the
wayside
and
begged
a
bed
for
himself
in
a
barn
belonging
to
one
of
the
small
village
farms
the
next
day
was
sunday
such
a
calm
quiet
day
the
very
air
seemed
full
of
sabbath
rest
the
country
children
were
just
going
to
the
sunday
school
as
the
caravan
started
their
mothers
had
carefully
dressed
them
in
their
best
clothes
and
were
watching
them
down
the
village
street
the
sick
woman
had
had
a
restless
and
tiring
night
little
rosalie
had
watched
beside
her
and
was
weary
and
sad
her
poor
mother
had
tossed
from
side
to
side
of
her
bed
and
could
find
no
position
in
which
she
was
comfortable
again
and
again
the
child
altered
her
mother
pillow
and
tried
to
make
her
more
easy
but
though
the
poor
woman
thanked
her
very
gently
not
many
minutes
had
passed
before
she
wanted
to
be
moved
again
but
the
sunday
stillness
seemed
to
have
a
soothing
effect
on
the
sick
woman
and
as
they
left
the
village
she
fell
asleep
for
hours
that
sleep
lasted
and
when
she
awoke
she
seemed
refreshed
and
rested
darling
she
said
calling
her
little
girl
to
her
side
had
such
a
beautiful
dream
was
it
mammie
dear
asked
rosalie
thought
i
was
looking
into
heaven
rosalie
dear
in
between
the
bars
of
the
golden
gates
and
i
saw
all
the
people
dressed
in
white
walking
up
and
down
the
streets
of
the
city
and
then
somebody
seemed
to
call
them
together
and
they
all
went
in
one
direction
and
there
was
a
beautiful
sound
of
singing
and
joy
as
if
they
had
heard
some
good
news
one
of
them
passed
close
to
the
gate
where
i
was
standing
rosalie
and
he
looked
so
happy
and
glad
as
he
was
hastening
on
to
join
the
others
so
i
called
him
darling
and
asked
him
what
was
going
on
what
did
he
say
mammie
dear
said
it
the
good
shepherd
who
has
called
us
he
wants
us
to
rejoice
with
him
he
has
just
found
one
of
the
lost
sheep
which
he
has
been
seeking
so
long
did
not
you
hear
his
voice
just
now
when
he
called
us
all
together
did
you
hear
him
saying
with
me
for
i
have
found
my
sheep
which
was
lost
then
they
all
began
to
sing
again
and
somehow
i
knew
they
were
singing
for
me
and
that
i
was
the
sheep
that
was
found
and
then
i
was
so
glad
that
i
awoke
with
joy
and
oh
rosalie
darling
i
know
my
dream
was
true
for
i
been
asking
him
to
find
me
again
and
again
and
i
quite
sure
that
he
wanted
to
do
it
long
before
i
asked
him
mammie
dear
said
rosalie
putting
her
hand
in
her
mother
so
glad
rosalie
mother
did
not
talk
any
more
then
but
she
lay
very
quietly
holding
rosalie
hand
and
every
now
and
then
she
smiled
as
if
the
music
of
the
heavenly
song
were
still
in
her
ears
and
as
if
she
still
heard
the
good
shepherd
saying
with
me
for
i
have
found
my
sheep
which
was
lost
then
they
passed
through
another
village
where
the
bells
were
ringing
for

the

sobbing
she

girl

gently

long
long
time
the
sobbing

rosalie
only

quietly

some

not
been
for
the
shepherd
love
but
he
took
such
pains
to

up
and
at
last
he
put
me
on
his
shoulders
and
carried
me
home
i
am
very
tired
rosalie
darling
but
there
is
more
that
i
wanted

i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
it
will
not
do
for
you
to
ask
your
father
about
going
to
your
aunt
lucy
because
he
would
never
let
you
and
he
would
only
be
writing
to
her
for
money
if
he
knew
where
she
lived
but
if
you
go
through
that
village
again
you

just
run
up
to
the
house
and
give
her
the
letter
i
do
know
if
that
would
do
either
said
the
poor

more
now
darling
i
am
so
tired
kiss
me
my
own
little
woman
rosalie
lifted
up
a
very
white
and
sorrowful
face
and
kissed
her
mother
passionately
could
sing
your
little
hymn
could
you
darling
said
the
sick
woman
rosalie
tried
her
very
best
to
sing
it
but
her
voice
trembled
so
that
she
could
not
manage
it
she
struggled
through
the
first
verse
but
in
the
second
she
quite
broke
down
and
burst
into
a
fresh
flood
of
tears
her
poor
mother
tried
to
soothe
her
but
was
too
weak
and
weary
to
do
more
than
stroke
the
child
face
with
her
thin
wasted
hand
and
whisper
in
her
ear
a
few
words
of
love
very
sorrowful
were
poor
rosalie
thoughts
as
she
sat
by
her
mother
bed
she
had
known
before
that
her
mother
was
very
ill
and
sometimes
she
had
been
afraid
as
she
thought
of
the
future
but
she
had
never
before
heard
that
dreadful
fear
put
into
words
she
had
never
before
known
that
it
was
not
merely
a
fear
but
a
terrible
reality
about
a
week
time
you
will
have
no
mother
that
was
what
her
mother
had
told
her
and
her
mother
was
everything
to
rosalie
she
had
never
known
a
love
or
care
augustus
had
never
acted
as
a
father
to
her
but
her
mother
her
mother
had
been
everything
to
her
from
the
day
she
was
born
until
now
rosalie
could
not
imagine
what
the
world
would
be
like
without
her
mother
she
could
hardly
fancy
herself
living
when
her
mother
was
dead
she
would
have
no
one
to
speak
to
her
no
one
to
care
for
her
no
one
to
love
her
of
love
thy
voice
is
speaking
come
to
me
what
was
it
made
her
think
of
that
just
now
was
it
not
the
good
voice
as
he
held
the
poor
lonely
lamb
closer
to
his
bosom
come
to
me
shepherd
i
do
come
said
little
weary
rosalie
come
to
thee
now
chapter
xii
a
lone
lamb
it
was
sunday
evening
when
the
caravan
reached
the
town
where
the
fair
was
to
be
held
the
travellers
passed
numbers
of
people
in
their
sunday
clothes
and
saw
many
churches
and
chapels
open
for
evening
service
as
they
drove
through
the
town
the
gaily
painted
caravan
looked
strangely
out
of
keeping
with
everything
around
it
on
that
holy
day
augustus
met
them
as
they
came
upon
the
common
which
was
apportioned
to
the
it
was
a
large
waste
piece
of
ground
on
a
cliff
overlooking
the
sea
for
this
great
fair
was
held
at
a
large
on
the
the
piece
of
ground
which
augustus
had
selected
was
close
to
the
beach
so
that
rosalie
could
hear
the
rolling
and
dashing
of
the
waves
on
the
rocks
below
as
she
sat
beside
her
mother
that
night
in
the
morning
as
her
mother
was
sleeping
quietly
she
stole
out
on
the
shore
and
wandered
about
amongst
the
rocks
before
the
rest
of
the
were
awake
a
long
ridge
of
rocks
stretched
out
into
the
sea
and
rosalie
walked
along
this
and
watched
the
restless
waves
as
they
dashed
against
it
and
broke
into
thick
white
foam
in
some
parts
the
rocky
way
was
covered
with
small
limpets
whose
shells
crackled
under
rosalie
feet
then
came
some
deep
pools
filled
with
green
and
red
seaweed
in
which
rosalie
discovered
pink
and
restless
little
crabs
she
examined
one
or
two
of
these
but
her
heart
was
too
sad
and
weary
to
be
interested
by
them
long
so
she
wandered
on
until
she
reached
the
extremity
of
the
ridge
of
rocks
here
she
sat
for
some
time
gazing
at
the
breakers
and
watching
the
sunshine
spreading
over
the
silvery
grey
waters
several
were
already
entering
the
port
laden
with
the
spoils
of
the
previous
night
and
rosalie
watched
them
coming
in
one
by
one
and
running
quickly
ashore
one
of
them
passed
close
by
the
spot
where
the
child
was
sitting
an
old
man
and
two
boys
were
in
it
and
they
were
singing
as
they
went
by
in
clear
ringing
voices
rosalie
could
hear
the
words
of
the
song
well
as
she
sat
on
the
ridge
of
rocks
night
my
lads
we
toiled
away
oh
so
drearily
drearily
but
we
weighed
our
anchor
at
break
of
day
oh
so
cheerily
cheerily
so
keep
up
heart
and
courage
friends
for
home
is
just
in
sight
and
who
will
heed
when
safely
there
the
perils
of
the
night
just
so
we
toil
through
earth
dark
night
oh
so
wearily
wearily
yet
we
trust
to
sail
at
dawn
of
light
oh
so
cheerily
cheerily
so
keep
up
heart
and
courage
friends
for
home
is
just
in
sight
and
who
will
heed
when
safely
there
the
perils
of
the
night
there
was
something
in
the
wild
tune
and
something
in
the
homely
words
which
soothed
rosalie
heart
as
she
walked
back
to
the
caravan
she
kept
saying
to
herself
keep
up
heart
and
courage
friends
for
home
is
just
in
sight
in
sight
that
must
be
for
my
mammie
thought
the
child
not
for
me
she
is
getting
very
near
home
her
mother
was
awake
when
rosalie
opened
the
caravan
door
but
she
seemed
very
weak
and
tired
and
all
that
long
day
scarcely
spoke
the
child
sat
beside
her
and
tried
to
tempt
her
to
eat
but
she
hardly
opened
her
eyes
and
would
take
nothing
but
a
little
water
in
the
afternoon
the
noise
of
the
fair
began
the
rattling
of
the
shooting
galleries
the
bells
of
the
three
large
whirligigs
and
two
noisy
bands
playing
different
tunes
and
making
a
strange
discordant
sound
an
odd
mixture
of
the
waltz
and
mary
ann
then
as
the
crowds
in
the
fair
became
denser
the
shouts
and
noise
increased
on
all
sides
and
the
sick
woman
moaned
to
herself
from
time
to
time
augustus
was
far
too
busy
preparing
for
the
evening
entertainment
to
spend
much
time
in
the
caravan
he
did
not
know
or
he
would
not
see
that
a
change
was
passing
over
his
wife
face
that
she
was
even
then
standing
on
the
margin
of
the
river
of
death
and
thus
about
half
an
hour
before
the
theatre
opened
he
called
to
rosalie
to
dress
herself
for
the
play
and
would
listen
to
none
of
her
entreaties
to
stay
with
her
dying
mother
her
dying
mother
yes
rosalie
knew
that
it
had
come
to
that
now
child
as
she
was
she
could
tell
that
there
was
something
in
her
mother
face
which
had
never
been
there
before
her
eyes
were
opened
to
the
truth
at
last
and
she
felt
that
death
was
not
very
far
away
how
could
she
leave
her
her
mother
hand
was
holding
hers
so
tightly
her
mother
eyes
whenever
they
were
opened
were
fixed
on
her
so
lovingly
how
could
she
leave
her
mother
even
for
an
hour
when
the
hours
which
she
might
still
have
with
her
were
becoming
so
few
yet
rosalie
dared
not
stay
was
not
this
the
great
fair
her
father
had
been
counting
on
all
the
year
and
from
which
he
hoped
to
reap
the
greatest
profit
and
had
he
not
told
her
that
very
night
that
if
she
broke
down
in
her
part
in
this
town
he
would
never
forgive
her
as
long
as
he
lived
no
there
was
no
help
for
it
rosalie
must
go
but
not
until
the
last
moment
not
until
the
very
last
moment
would
she
leave
her
dying
mother
she
dressed
very
quickly
and
sat
down
in
her
little
white
dress
beside
her
mother
bed
once
more
she
held
her
mother
cold
hand
and
gently
stroked
her
pale
face
rosalie
said
her
mother
darling
are
you
going
must
you
leave
me
mammie
mammie
it
is
so
hard
so
very
very
hard
cry
my
darling
my
little
lamb
do
cry
it
all
right
lift
me
up
a
little
rosalie
the
child
altered
her
mother
pillows
very
gently
and
then
the
sick
woman
whispered
close
to
the
deep
waters
i
can
hear
the
sound
of
them
now
it
the
river
of
death
rosalie
and
i
got
to
cross
it
but
i
not
afraid
the
good
shepherd
has
laid
me
on
his
shoulder
and
as
i
so
very
weak
i
think
he
carry
me
through
this
was
said
with
great
difficulty
and
when
she
had
done
speaking
the
dying
woman
head
fell
back
on
the
pillow
rosalie
could
not
speak
she
could
only
kiss
her
mother
hand
and
cry
quietly
as
she
watched
and
then
came
her
father
call
to
her
to
make
haste
and
come
into
the
theatre
and
she
had
to
disengage
herself
from
her
mother
hand
and
giving
one
last
long
look
to
shut
the
door
and
leave
her
leave
her
alone
what
happened
in
the
theatre
that
night
rosalie
never
exactly
knew
it
all
seemed
as
a
horrible
dream
to
her
she
said
the
words
and
acted
her
part
but
she
saw
not
the
stage
nor
the
spectators
her
eyes
all
the
time
were
on
her
mother
face
her
hand
all
the
time
felt
her
mother
dying
grasp
and
yet
as
she
danced
and
sang
there
were
many
there
who
thought
her
happy
many
who
envied
her
and
who
would
have
gladly
changed
places
with
her
oh
if
they
had
only
known
if
they
had
only
had
the
faintest
idea
of
the
anguish
of
that
little
heart
of
the
keen
cruel
cutting
sorrow
with
which
it
was
filled
troubles
some
of
these
people
undoubtedly
had
cares
and
vexations
and
worries
not
a
few
yet
none
of
them
had
known
anything
of
the
of
that
little
actress
not
one
of
them
had
ever
been
torn
from
the
side
of
a
dying
mother
and
been
compelled
to
laugh
and
sing
when
their
very
hearts
were
bleeding
from
such
agony
they
had
been
saved
and
shielded
and
yet
they
would
have
chosen
the
very
lot
which
would
have
exposed
them
to
it
oh
how
very
little
they
knew
of
what
was
going
on
behind
the
scenes
how
little
they
guessed
what
a
tumult
of
passionate
sorrow
was
in
little
rosalie
heart
so
wild
was
her
grief
that
she
hardly
knew
what
she
was
doing
and
after
the
play
was
over
she
could
not
have
told
how
she
managed
to
get
through
it
instead
of
going
out
on
the
platform
she
darted
swiftly
out
of
the
theatre
and
into
her
mother
caravan
almost
knocking
over
several
people
who
were
passing
by
and
who
stared
at
her
in
astonishment
her
mother
was
not
dead
oh
how
glad
rosalie
was
for
that
but
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
speak
and
her
breathing
was
very
painful
rosalie
bent
over
her
and
cave
her
one
long
long
kiss
and
then
hurried
back
into
the
theatre
just
as
her
father
had
missed
her
and
when
she
next
came
into
the
caravan
all
was
still
her
mother
seemed
to
be
sleeping
more
quietly
the
painful
breathing
had
ceased
and
the
child
hoped
she
was
easier
she
certainly
seemed
more
restful
and
her
hands
were
still
warm
so
she
could
not
be
dead
little
rosalie
reasoned
to
herself
poor
child
she
did
not
know
that
even
then
she
had
no
mother
weary
and
aching
in
every
limb
little
rosalie
fell
asleep
on
the
chair
by
her
mother
side
and
when
she
awoke
with
a
shiver
in
the
dead
of
night
and
once
more
felt
her
mother
hand
it
was
as
cold
as
ice
and
rosalie
knew
then
that
she
was
dead
trembling
in
every
limb
and
almost
too
startled
to
realise
her
sorrow
she
unfastened
the
caravan
door
and
crept
out
into
the
darkness
to
tell
her
father
but
he
and
the
men
were
sleeping
soundly
on
the
floor
of
the
little
theatre
and
though
rosalie
hammered
against
the
gilded
boards
in
front
she
could
make
no
one
hear
her
again
and
again
she
knocked
but
no
answer
came
from
within
for
the
theatre
people
were
tired
with
their
work
and
could
not
hear
the
tiny
little
hands
on
the
outside
of
the
show
so
the
poor
child
had
to
return
to
the
desolate
caravan
with
one
bitter
cry
of
anguish
one
long
passionate
wail
of
grief
she
threw
herself
on
her
mother
bed
her
sorrow
could
not
disturb
that
mother
now
she
was
gone
to
that
land
which
is
very
far
off
where
even
the
sound
of
weeping
is
never
heard
the
good
shepherd
had
carried
her
safely
over
the
river
and
as
rosalie
wept
in
the
dark
caravan
he
was
even
then
welcoming
her
mother
to
the
home
above
he
was
even
then
saying
in
tones
of
joy
yet
more
glad
than
before
with
me
for
i
have
found
my
sheep
which
was
lost
but
rosalie
poor
little
desolate
motherless
rosalie
had
the
good
shepherd
quite
forgotten
her
was
she
left
in
her
sorrow
alone
and
forsaken
was
there
no
comfort
for
the
orphaned
lamb
in
her
bitter
distress
did
he
pass
her
by
untended
and
unblessed
or
did
he
not
rather
draw
doubly
near
in
that
night
of
darkness
did
he
not
care
for
the
lonely
lamb
did
he
not
whisper
words
of
sweetest
comfort
and
love
to
the
weary
sorrowful
rosalie
if
not
what
was
it
that
made
her
feel
as
she
lay
on
her
mother
bed
that
she
was
not
altogether
deserted
that
there
was
one
who
loved
her
still
what
was
it
that
gave
her
that
strange
happy
feeling
that
she
was
lying
in
the
good
shepherd
arms
and
that
he
was
folding
her
to
his
bosom
even
more
tenderly
than
her
mother
had
done
what
was
it
but
the
good
shepherd
fulfilling
those
gracious
loving
words
of
his
shall
gather
the
lambs
with
his
arm
and
carry
them
in
his
bosom
it
was
the
next
morning
the
sun
had
risen
some
time
and
the
were
beginning
to
stir
the
were
once
more
coming
home
and
the
breakers
were
rolling
on
the
shore
augustus
joyce
awoke
with
a
strange
feeling
of
uneasiness
for
which
he
could
not
account
nothing
had
gone
wrong
the
night
before
rosalie
had
made
no
mistake
in
her
part
and
his
profits
had
been
larger
than
usual
and
yet
augustus
joyce
was
not
happy
he
had
had
a
dream
the
night
before
perhaps
that
was
the
reason
he
had
dreamt
of
his
wife
and
it
was
not
often
that
he
dreamt
of
her
now
he
had
dreamt
of
her
not
as
she
was
then
thin
and
worn
and
wasted
but
as
she
had
been
on
his
when
she
had
been
his
bride
and
he
had
promised
to
take
her
better
for
worse
for
richer
for
poorer
in
sickness
and
in
health
to
love
and
to
cherish
her
till
death
should
them
part
somehow
or
other
when
augustus
woke
those
words
were
ringing
in
his
ears
what
had
he
been
to
her
in
poverty
how
had
he
treated
her
in
sickness
had
he
soothed
her
and
cared
for
her
and
done
all
he
could
to
make
their
burden
press
lightly
on
her
had
he
loved
her
and
cherished
her
loved
her
what
did
those
cruel
words
those
bitter
taunts
those
unsympathising
speeches
tell
of
the
love
of
augustus
joyce
for
his
wife
cherished
her
what
kind
of
cherishing
had
he
bestowed
upon
her
during
her
illness
what
kind
of
cherishing
had
he
shown
her
when
he
had
compelled
her
almost
fainting
to
take
her
part
in
the
play
death
us
do
part
that
time
was
very
near
now
augustus
joyce
knew
that
for
once
the
voice
of
conscience
was
heard
by
him
he
could
not
forget
the
lovely
face
he
had
seen
in
his
dream
nor
the
sad
reproachful
gaze
of
those
beautiful
dark
eyes
he
jumped
from
his
bed
and
dressed
hastily
he
would
give
his
wife
some
kind
words
at
least
that
morning
conscience
should
not
taunt
him
with
his
bitter
neglect
again
he
hurried
to
the
other
caravan
opened
the
door
and
entered
what
was
the
scene
which
met
his
gaze
the
sunbeams
were
streaming
in
through
the
small
window
and
falling
on
the
bed
and
there
lay
his
wife
so
pale
so
ghastly
so
still
that
augustus
joyce
drew
back
in
horror
and
there
with
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
the
wreath
of
roses
fallen
from
her
hair
on
her
mother
pillow
lay
little
rosalie
fast
asleep
with
the
traces
of
tears
still
on
her
cheeks
intense
sleep
and
weariness
had
taken
possession
of
her
and
she
had
fallen
asleep
on
her
mother
bed
in
her
white
dress
just
as
she
had
been
acting
at
the
play
augustus
drew
nearer
to
his
wife
and
sat
down
beside
her
yes
she
was
dead
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
the
kind
words
could
never
be
spoken
she
would
never
hear
him
again
he
could
never
show
his
love
to
her
now
never
cherish
her
more
death
us
do
part
it
parted
them
now
parted
them
for
ever
it
was
too
late
for
augustus
joyce
to
make
any
amends
too
late
for
him
to
do
anything
to
appease
his
conscience
when
rosalie
awoke
she
found
herself
being
lifted
from
the
bed
by
her
father
and
carried
into
the
other
caravan
there
he
laid
her
on
his
own
bed
and
went
out
shutting
the
door
behind
him
and
the
next
few
days
seemed
like
one
long
dreary
night
to
rosalie
of
the
inquest
and
the
preparations
for
the
funeral
she
knew
nothing
she
seemed
like
one
in
a
dream
the
fair
went
on
all
around
her
and
the
noise
and
racket
made
her
more
and
more
miserable
what
she
liked
best
was
to
hear
the
dull
roaring
of
the
sea
after
the
naphtha
lights
were
out
and
all
in
the
fair
was
still
for
somehow
with
the
roaring
of
the
waves
the
fishermen
song
came
back
to
her
keep
up
heart
and
courage
friends
for
home
is
just
in
sight
and
who
will
heed
when
safely
there
the
perils
of
the
night
and
somehow
rosalie
hardly
knew
why
that
song
comforted
and
soothed
her
chapter
xiii
vanity
fair
rosie
dear
can
i
speak
to
you
said
toby
voice
the
day
before
the
funeral
come
in
toby
said
the
child
mournfully
should
like
to
see
you
miss
rosie
said
toby
mysteriously
be
offended
will
you
but
i
brought
you
this
then
followed
a
great
fumbling
in
toby
pockets
and
from
the
depths
of
one
of
them
was
produced
a
large
red
from
which
when
he
had
undone
the
various
knots
he
took
out
most
carefully
a
little
parcel
which
he
laid
on
rosalie
knee
only
a
bit
of
black
miss
rosie
dear
he
said
thought
you
could
put
it
on
and
you
must
mind
my
seeing
after
it
there
was
no
one
to
do
it
but
me
and
before
rosalie
could
thank
him
he
was
gone
when
she
opened
the
parcel
she
found
in
it
a
piece
of
broad
black
ribbon
and
a
little
black
silk
handkerchief
the
best
poor
toby
could
obtain
rosalie
tears
fell
afresh
as
she
fastened
the
ribbon
on
her
hat
to
be
ready
for
the
sorrowful
service
on
the
morrow
the
fair
was
nearly
over
yet
some
of
the
shows
lingered
and
there
were
still
crowds
of
children
round
the
whirligigs
and
when
the
mournful
procession
went
by
the
children
at
first
drew
back
in
astonishment
it
was
an
unexpected
sight
a
coffin
on
the
but
astonishment
soon
gave
way
to
curiosity
and
they
crowded
round
the
little
band
of
mourners
and
followed
them
nearly
to
the
cemetery
augustus
went
through
the
service
with
an
unmoved
face
conscience
had
been
making
its
final
appeal
the
last
few
days
and
had
made
one
last
and
mighty
effort
to
arouse
augustus
joyce
to
repentance
but
he
had
stifled
conscience
suppressed
it
trampled
on
it
extinguished
it
god
holy
spirit
had
been
resisted
and
quenched
already
and
the
conscience
of
the
impenitent
sinner
was
as
with
a
hot
iron
all
the
company
of
the
theatre
followed
augustus
joyce
wife
to
the
grave
and
more
than
one
of
them
felt
unusually
moved
as
they
looked
at
little
sorrowful
rosalie
walking
by
her
father
side
she
was
quite
calm
and
quiet
and
never
shed
a
tear
until
the
service
was
over
and
she
was
walking
through
the
quiet
cemetery
a
little
behind
the
rest
of
the
party
then
her
eyes
fell
upon
toby
who
was
walking
near
her
with
an
air
of
real
heartfelt
sorrow
on
his
honest
face
he
had
tied
a
piece
of
crape
round
his
hat
and
a
black
handkerchief
round
his
neck
out
of
respect
for
his
late
mistress
and
for
his
mistress
little
daughter
something
in
the
curious
way
in
which
the
crape
was
fastened
on
something
in
the
thought
of
the
kindly
heart
which
had
planned
this
token
of
sympathy
touched
rosalie
and
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
for
the
first
time
on
that
sorrowful
day
for
sometimes
when
a
groat
sorrow
is
so
strong
as
to
shut
up
with
a
firm
hand
those
tears
which
would
bring
relief
to
the
aching
heart
a
little
thing
a
very
little
thing
perhaps
only
a
flower
which
our
lost
one
loved
or
something
she
touched
for
the
last
time
or
spoke
of
on
the
last
day
or
it
may
be
as
with
rosalie
only
a
spark
of
kindly
sympathy
where
we
have
scarcely
looked
for
it
and
an
expression
of
feeling
which
was
almost
unexpected
such
a
little
thing
as
this
will
open
in
a
moment
the
of
sorrow
and
give
us
that
relief
for
which
we
have
been
longing
and
yearning
in
vain
so
rosalie
found
it
the
moment
her
eyes
rested
on
toby
face
and
on
toby
bit
of
crape
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
was
able
to
weep
out
the
intenseness
of
her
sorrow
and
after
that
came
a
calm
in
her
heart
for
somehow
she
felt
as
if
the
angels
song
was
not
yet
over
as
if
they
were
still
singing
for
joy
over
her
mother
soul
and
as
if
the
lord
the
good
shepherd
were
still
saying
with
me
for
i
have
found
my
sheep
which
was
lost
then
they
left
the
seaport
town
and
set
off
for
a
distant
fair
and
little
rosalie
was
very
solitary
in
her
caravan
everywhere
and
in
everything
she
felt
a
sense
of
loss
her
father
came
occasionally
to
see
her
but
his
visits
were
anything
but
agreeable
and
she
always
felt
relieved
when
he
went
away
again
to
the
other
caravan
thus
the
hours
by
day
seemed
long
and
monotonous
with
no
one
inside
the
caravan
to
speak
to
no
one
to
care
for
or
to
nurse
she
often
climbed
beside
toby
and
watched
him
driving
and
spoke
to
him
of
the
things
which
they
passed
by
the
way
but
the
hours
by
night
were
the
longest
of
all
when
the
caravan
was
drawn
up
on
a
lonely
moor
or
in
a
valley
when
rosalie
was
left
alone
through
those
long
desolate
hours
and
there
was
no
sound
to
be
heard
but
the
hooting
of
the
owls
and
the
soughing
of
the
wind
amongst
the
trees
then
indeed
little
rosalie
felt
desolate
and
she
would
kneel
upon
one
of
the
boxes
and
look
out
towards
the
other
caravans
to
be
sure
that
they
were
near
enough
to
hear
her
call
to
them
if
anything
happened
then
she
would
kneel
down
and
repeat
her
evening
prayer
again
and
again
and
entreat
the
good
shepherd
to
carry
her
in
his
arms
now
that
she
was
so
lonely
and
had
no
mother
but
they
soon
arrived
at
the
fair
for
which
they
were
bound
the
acting
went
on
as
usual
and
rosalie
had
once
more
to
take
her
place
on
the
stage
very
dreary
and
dismal
and
tawdry
everything
seemed
to
her
her
little
white
dress
the
dress
in
which
she
had
lain
by
her
mother
side
was
soiled
and
tumbled
and
the
wreath
of
roses
looked
crushed
and
faded
as
rosalie
took
it
from
the
box
there
was
no
mother
to
fasten
it
on
her
hair
no
mother
to
cheer
and
comfort
her
as
she
went
slowly
up
the
theatre
steps
her
father
was
looking
for
her
and
told
her
they
were
all
waiting
and
then
the
play
commenced
rosalie
eyes
wandered
up
and
down
the
theatre
and
she
wondered
how
it
was
that
when
she
was
a
very
little
girl
she
had
thought
it
so
beautiful
it
was
just
the
same
now
as
it
had
been
then
the
gilding
was
just
as
bright
the
lamps
were
just
as
sparkling
the
scenery
had
been
repainted
and
was
even
more
showy
and
striking
yet
it
all
looked
different
to
rosalie
it
seemed
to
her
very
poor
and
disappointing
and
paltry
as
she
looked
at
it
from
her
place
on
the
stage
and
then
she
thought
of
her
mother
and
of
the
different
place
in
which
she
was
spending
that
very
evening
rosalie
had
been
reading
about
it
that
afternoon
before
she
dressed
herself
for
the
play
she
thought
of
the
streets
of
gold
on
which
her
mother
was
walking
pure
gold
not
like
the
tinsel
and
gilt
of
the
theatre
she
thought
of
the
white
robe
clean
and
fair
in
which
her
mother
was
dressed
so
unlike
her
little
tumbled
soiled
frock
she
thought
of
the
new
song
her
mother
was
singing
so
different
from
the
coarse
low
songs
that
were
being
sung
in
the
theatre
she
thought
of
the
music
to
which
her
mother
was
listening
the
voice
of
harpers
harping
with
their
harps
and
she
thought
how
different
it
was
from
the
noisy
band
close
to
her
and
from
the
clanging
music
which
her
company
was
making
she
thought
too
of
the
words
which
her
mother
was
saying
to
the
good
shepherd
perhaps
even
then
art
worthy
for
thou
wast
slain
and
hast
redeemed
me
to
god
by
thy
blood
how
different
were
these
words
from
the
silly
foolish
profane
words
she
herself
was
repeating
oh
did
her
mother
think
of
her
how
little
rosalie
wondered
if
she
did
and
oh
how
often
she
longed
to
be
with
her
mother
in
the
golden
city
instead
of
in
the
hot
wearying
theatre
and
so
the
weeks
went
on
fair
after
fair
was
visited
her
father
new
play
was
repeated
again
and
again
till
it
seemed
very
old
to
rosalie
the
theatre
was
set
up
and
taken
down
and
all
went
on
much
as
usual
there
was
no
change
in
the
child
life
except
that
she
had
found
a
new
occupation
and
pleasure
and
this
was
teaching
toby
to
read
rosie
he
had
said
one
day
wish
i
could
read
the
testament
you
read
toby
a
word
missie
i
only
wish
i
could
i
not
been
what
i
ought
to
be
miss
rosie
and
i
do
want
to
do
different
will
you
teach
me
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
rosalie
began
to
teach
poor
toby
to
read
and
after
that
she
might
often
be
seen
perched
on
the
seat
beside
toby
with
her
testament
in
her
hand
pointing
out
one
word
after
another
to
him
as
they
drove
slowly
along
and
when
toby
was
tired
of
reading
rosalie
would
read
to
him
some
story
out
of
the
bible
but
the
one
they
both
loved
best
and
the
one
they
read
more
often
than
any
other
was
the
parable
of
the
lost
sheep
rosalie
was
never
tired
of
reading
that
nor
toby
of
hearing
it
there
was
one
thing
for
which
rosalie
was
very
anxious
and
that
was
to
meet
little
mother
manikin
again
at
every
fair
they
visited
she
looked
with
eager
eyes
for
the
show
of
dwarfs
but
they
seemed
to
have
taken
a
different
circuit
from
that
of
the
theatre
party
for
fair
after
fair
went
by
without
rosalie
wish
being
gratified
but
at
length
one
afternoon
the
last
afternoon
of
the
fair
toby
came
running
to
the
caravan
with
an
eager
face
rosie
he
said
just
found
the
royal
show
of
dwarfs
here
miss
rosie
and
as
soon
as
i
caught
sight
of
the
picture
over
the
door
thinks
i
to
myself
miss
rosie
will
be
glad
so
i
went
up
to
the
door
and
spoke
to
the
conductor
they
got
a
new
one
miss
rosie
and
he
said
they
were
going
so
i
ran
off
at
once
to
tell
you
i
knew
you
would
like
to
see
little
mother
manikin
again
dear

rosalie
looked
rather
fearfully
at
the
dense
crowd
beneath
her
she
had
never
wandered
about
the
fair
but
had
kept
quietly
in
the
caravan
as
her
mother
had
wished
her
to
do
so
she
knew
very
little
of
what
was
going
on
in
other
parts
of
the
ground
is
it
toby
she
asked
away
at
the
other
end
of
the
field
miss
rosie
do
you
hear
that
clanging
noise
said
rosalie
well
it
sounds
as
if
all
the
tin
trays
in
the
town
were
being
thrown
one
upon
another
the
giant
cave
miss
rosie
where
that
noise
is
and
the
dwarf
show
is
close
by
keep
that
noise
in
your
ears
and
you
will
be
sure
to
find
it
so
rosalie
left
toby
in
the
caravan
and
went
down
into
the
pushing
crowd
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
the
fair
was
full
of
people
they
were
going
in
different
directions
and
it
was
hard
work
for
rosalie
to
get
through
them
it
was
only
by
very
slow
degrees
that
she
could
make
her
way
through
the
fair
it
was
a
curious
scene
a
long
row
of
bright
gilded
shows
was
on
one
side
of
her
and
at
the
door
of
each
stood
a
man
addressing
the
crowd
and
setting
forth
the
special
merits
and
attractions
of
his
show
first
there
were
the
waxworks
with
a
row
of
specimen
figures
outside
and
their
champion
proclaiming
and
gentlemen
here
is
the
most
select
show
in
the
fair
here
is
amusement
and
instruction
combined
here
is
nothing
to
offend
the
moral
and
artistic
taste
you
may
see
here
abraham
offering
up
aaron
and
henry
iv
in
prison
cain
and
abel
in
the
garden
of
eden
and
william
the
conqueror
driving
out
the
ancient
britons
then
as
rosalie
pressed
on
through
the
crowd
she
was
jostled
in
front
of
the
show
of
the
giant
boy
and
girl
here
there
was
a
great
concourse
of
people
gazing
at
the
huge
picture
of
an
enormously
fat
highlander
which
was
hung
over
the
door
there
was
a
curious
band
in
front
of
this
show
consisting
of
a
man
beating
a
drum
with
his
right
hand
and
turning
a
barrel
organ
with
his
left
and
another
man
blowing
vociferously
through
a
trumpet
in
spite
of
all
this
noise
a
third
man
was
standing
on
a
raised
platform
addressing
the
crowds
beneath
say
i
say

rosalie
struggled
on
but
another
enormous
crowd
stopped
her
way
this
time
it
was
in
front
of
the
show
of
marionettes
or
dancing
dolls

the
platform
outside

show

a
man

doll

cried
the
man
outside

past
all
these
shows
rosalie
pushed
longing
to
get
on
yet
unable
to
hurry
then
she
came
to
a
corner
of
the
fair
where
a
cheap
jack
was
crying
his
wares
a
watch

the
man

and
became

the
possessor
of
the
watch
which
the
man
had
declared
only
two
minutes
before
he
would
not
part
with
for
two
pounds
ten
shillings
rosalie
pressed
on
and
turned
the
corner
here
there
was
another
row
of
shows
the
fat
boy
whose
huge
clothes
were
being
paraded
outside
as
an
earnest
of
what
was
to
be
seen
within
the
lady
without
arms
whose
wonderful
feats
of
knitting
sewing
writing
and
were
being
rehearsed
to
the
crowd
the
entertaining
theatre
outside
which
was
a
stuffed
performing
cat
playing
on
a
drum
and
two
tiny
children
of
about
three
years
old
dressed
up
in
the
most
extraordinary
costumes
and
dancing
with
tambourines
in
their
hands
the
picture
gallery
in
which
you
could
see
adam
and
eve
queen
elizabeth
and
other
distinguished
persons
all
these
were
on
rosalie
right
hand
and
on
her
left
was
a
long
succession
of
stalls
on
which
were
sold
gingerbread
brandysnap
nuts
biscuits
boiled
peas
hot
potatoes
and
sweets
of
all
kinds
here
was
a
man
selling
cheap
and
there
another
offering
the
boys
a
moustache
and
a
pair
of
spectacles
for
a
penny
each
and
assuring
them
that
if
they
would
only
lay
down
the
small
sum
of
twopence
they
might
become
the
greatest
swells
in
the
town
how
glad
rosalie
was
to
get
past
them
all
and
to
hear
the
clanging
sound
from
the
giant
cave
growing
nearer
and
nearer
and
at
last
to
her
joy
she
arrived
before
the
show
of
dwarfs
she
thought
shall
see
mother
manikin
the
performance
was
just
about
to
begin
and
the
conductor
was
standing
at
the
door
inviting
people
to
enter
miss
he
said
turning
to
rosalie
your
time
only
a
penny
and
none
of
them
more
than
three
feet
high
showing
now
showing
now
rosalie
paid
the
money
and
pressed
eagerly
into
the
show
the
little
people
had
just
appeared
and
were
bowing
and
paying
compliments
to
the
company
but
mother
manikin
was
not
there
rosalie
eyes
wandered
up
and
down
the
show
and
peered
behind
the
curtain
at
the
end
but
mother
manikin
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
rosalie
could
not
watch
the
performance
so
anxious
was
she
to
know
if
her
dear
little
friend
were
within
at
last
the
entertainment
was
over
and
the
giant
and
dwarfs
shook
hands
with
the
company
before
ushering
them
out
rosalie
was
the
last
to
leave
and
when
the
tall
thin
giant
came
up
to
her
she
looked
up
timidly
into
his
face
and
said
sir

see

said
the
giant
majestically
rosalie

manikin
the
greatest
of
pleasure

said
the

the
business

that
she

said
the
dwarfs

said
the
child
with
a
little
cry
of
disappointment

determined

show
somehow
she
grew
tired
of
entertaining
company
and
told
us

asked

you

my

said
master

and
miss
mab
so
rosalie
sorrowfully
turned
homewards
and
struggled
out
through
the
surging
mass
of
people
the
conductor
at
the
door
pointed
out
to
her
a
shorter
way
to
the
theatre
caravan
she
was
glad
to
get
out
of
the
clanging
sound
of
the
giant
cave
from
the
platform
of
which
a
man
was
assuring
the
crowd
that
if
only
they
would
come
to
this
show
they
would
be
sure
to
come
again
that
very
evening
and
would
bring
all
their
dearest
friends
with
them
then
the
child
went
through
a
long
covered
bazaar
in
which
was
a
multitude
of
toys
wax
dolls
wooden
dolls
china
dolls
composition
dolls
rag
dolls
and
dolls
of
all
descriptions
together
with
wooden
horses
donkeys
elephants
and
every
kind
of
toy
in
which
children
delight
after
this
she
came
out
upon
a
more
open
space
where
a
happy
family
was
being
displayed
to
an
admiring
throng
it
consisted
of
a
large
cage
fastened
to
a
cart
which
was
drawn
by
a
donkey
inside
the
cage
were
various
animals
living
on
the
most
friendly
terms
with
each
other
a
little
dog
in
a
smart
coat
playing
with
several
small
white
rats
a
monkey
hugging
a
little
white
kitten
a
white
cat
which
had
been
dyed
a
brilliant
yellow
superintending
the
sports
of
a
number
of
mice
and
dormice
and
a
duck
a
hen
and
a
which
were
conversing
together
in
one
corner
of
the
cage
over
this
motley
assembly
was
a
board
which
announced
that
this
happy
family
was
supported
entirely
by
voluntary
contributions
and
a
woman
was
going
about
amongst
the
crowd
shaking
a
tin
plate
at
them
and
crying
out
against
their
stinginess
if
they
refused
to
contribute
rosalie
passed
the
happy
family
with
difficulty
and
made
her
way
down
another
street
in
the
fair
on
one
side
of
her
were
making
a
deafening
noise
and
on
the
other
were
all
manner
of
contrivances
for
making
money
first
came
machines
for
the
trial
of
strength
consisting
of
a
flat
pasteboard
figure
of
the
shah
or
some
other
distinguished
person
holding
on
his
chest
a
the
hand
of
which
indicated
the
amount
of
strength
possessed
by
any
one
who
hit
a
certain
part
of
the
machine
with
all
his
might
now
have
you
seen
the
shah
cried
the
owner
of
one
of
these
machines
now
try
your
strength
i
believe
you
the
strongest
fellow
that
has
passed
by
come
now
let
see
what
you
can
do
the
required
penny
was
paid
and
there
followed
a
tremendous
blow
a
tinkling
of
bells
on
the
pasteboard
figure
and
an
announcement
from
the
owner
of
the
show
of
the
number
of
stones
which
the
man
had
moved
then
there
were
the
covered
with
red
velvet
in
which
you
were
invited
to
sit
and
be
weighed
there
was
the
a
turk
in
a
turban
who
confided
to
the
crowd
in
broken
english
not
only
the
price
of
his
sponges
but
also
many
touching
and
interesting
details
of
his
personal
history
there
was
also
the
usual
gathering
of
professional
beggars
some
without
arms
and
legs
others
deaf
or
dumb
or
blind
or
all
three
cripples
and
imbeciles
and
idiots
who
go
from
fair
to
fair
and
town
to
town
and
get
so
much
money
that
they
make
five
or
six
shillings
a
day
and
live
in
luxury
all
the
year
round
the
child
went
quickly
past
them
all
and
came
upon
the
region
of
whirligigs
four
or
five
of
which
were
at
work
and
were
whirling
in
different
directions
and
made
her
feel
so
dizzy
that
she
hardly
knew
where
she
was
going
oh
how
glad
she
was
to
see
her
own
caravan
again
to
get
safely
out
of
the
restless
noisy
multitude
out
of
the
sound
of
the
shouting
of
the
and
the
swearing
of
the
drunken
men
and
women
and
out
of
the
pushing
and
jostling
of
the
crowd
she
thought
to
herself
as
she
went
up
the
caravan
steps
that
if
she
had
her
own
way
she
would
never
go
near
a
fair
again
and
oh
how
she
wondered
that
the
people
who
had
their
own
way
came
to
it
in
such
numbers
toby
was
looking
anxiously
for
her
from
the
caravan
window
rosie
dear
he
said
thought
you
were
never
coming
i
got
quite
frightened
about
you
you
such
a
little
mite
of
a
thing
to
go
fighting
your
own
way
in
that
great
big
crowd
toby
said
rosalie
have
seen
mother
manikin
and
she
told
him
what
she
had
heard
from
the
giant
of
mother
manikin
prospects
am
sorry
said
toby
you
have
had
all
your
walk
for
nothing
said
the
child
i
never
mean
to
go
through
the
fair
again
if
i
can
possibly
help
it
never
again
chapter
xiv
betsey
ann
there
was
still
some
time
before
rosalie
need
dress
herself
for
the
play
she
sat
still
after
toby
had
left
her
thinking
over
all
she
had
seen
in
the
fair
and
it
made
her
very
sad
indeed
there
were
such
a
number
of
lies
being
told
she
knew
there
were
such
a
number
of
things
were
being
passed
off
for
what
they
really
were
not
and
then
after
all
even
if
the
shows
were
what
they
pretended
to
be
what
a
poor
miserable
way
it
seemed
of
trying
to
be
happy
the
child
wondered
how
many
in
that
moving
multitude
were
really
happy
rosalie
was
thinking
about
this
when
she
heard
a
sound
close
to
her
a
very
different
sound
from
the
shouting
of
the
or
the
noisy
proclamations
of
the
showmen
it
was
the
sound
of
singing
she
went
to
the
door
of
the
caravan
and
looked
out
the
little
theatre
was
set
up
at
the
edge
of
the
fair
close
to
the
street
and
very
near
the
caravan
so
near
that
rosalie
could
hear
all
they
said
was
standing
a
group
of
men
one
of
them
had
just
given
out
a
hymn
and
he
and
all
the
rest
were
singing
it
the
child
could
hear
every
word
of
it
distinctly
there
was
a
chorus
at
the
end
of
each
verse
which
came
so
often
that
before
the
hymn
was
finished
she
knew
it
quite
perfectly
will
whosoever
will
sound
the
proclamation
over
vale
and
hill
is
a
loving
father
calls
his
children
home
whosoever
will
may
come
by
the
time
that
they
had
finished
the
first
verse
of
the
hymn
a
great
crowd
had
collected
round
the
men
attracted
perhaps
by
the
contrast
between
that
sweet
solemn
hymn
and
the
din
and
tumult
in
every
other
part
of
the
fair
then
one
of
the
men
began
to
speak
he
said
and
as
he
spoke
a
great
stillness
fell
on
the
listening
crowd
i
have
an
invitation
for
you
will
you
listen
to
my
invitation
you
are
being
invited
in
all
directions
each
man
invites
you
to
his
own
show
and
tells
you
that
it
is
the
best
one
in
the
fair
each
time
you
pass
him
he
calls
out
to
you
come

time

invitation

time

my
friends
has

with
this
invitation
to
you

says

heavy
laden
he
wants

reason
together
though

your
time
behold
he
says
now
is
the
accepted
time
now
is
the
day
of
salvation
friends
this
is
the
invitation
but
it
is
a
very
different
one
from
the
one
that
man
is
giving
at
that
show
over
there
what
does
he
say
to
those
people
who
are
listening
to
him
just
now
does
he
say
here
my
show
the
door
is
open
any
one
who
likes
may
walk
in
there
nothing
to
pay
does
he
say
that
my
friends
does
he
ever
give
his
invitation
in
that
way
no
my
friends
he
always
follows
up
his
come
come
now
your
time
with
some
such
words
as
these
only
twopence
only
twopence
only
twopence
to
pay
come
now
and
if
you
do
not
produce
your
twopence
will
he
let
you
in
if
you
are
so
poor
that
you
have
not
twopence
in
the
world
will
he
say
to
you
come
come
now
now
your
time
no
my
friends
that
he
will
not
the
lord
jesus
christ
invites
you
quite
differently
he
cries
out
ho
every
one
that
thirsteth
come
come
without
money
come
without
price
whosoever
will
may
come
yes
my
friends
the
words
whosoever
will
are
written
over
the
door
which
the
lord
jesus
christ
wants
you
to
enter
this
is
one
way
in
which
his
invitation
is
quite
different
from
that
which
that
man
is
giving
from
the
door
of
the
show
will
sing
another
verse
of
the
hymn
and
then
i
will
tell
you
the
other
great
difference
between
the
two
invitations
so
again
they
sang
will
whosoever
will
sound
the
proclamation
over
vale
and
hill
is
a
loving
father
calls
his
children
home
whosoever
will
may
come
my
friends
said
the
speaker
when
the
verse
was
finished
was
once
in
russia
a
very
curious
palace
it
was
built
of
nothing
but
ice
the
walls
were
ice
and
the
roof
was
ice
and
all
the
furniture
was
ice
there
were
ice
sofas
ice
chairs
ice
fireplaces
ice
ornaments
the
water
was
made
different
colours
and
then
frozen
so
that
everything
looked
real
and
solid
at
night
the
palace
was
lighted
up
and
it
shone
and
sparkled
as
if
it
were
set
with
diamonds
every
one
said
what
a
beautiful
palace
it
did
not
last
my
friends
it
did
not
last
the
thaw
came
and
the
ice
palace
faded
away
there
was
soon
nothing
left
of
it
but
a
pool
of
dirty
water
it
was
all
gone
it
was
very
fine
for
a
time
but
there
was
nothing
solid
in
it
and
it
melted
away
like
a
dream
friends
yonder
in
that
fair
is
the
world
it
sparkles
it
glitters
it
looks
very
fine
but
it
is
solid
it
wo
last
it
will
all
be
over
it
will
have
melted
away
like
a
dream
nothing
will
be
left
but
dust
and
dirt
and
misery
there
will
be
many
aching
heads
and
aching
hearts
this
time
friends
the
world
grandest
display
is
a
very
disappointing
thing
after
all
and
this
is
the
second
way
in
which
the
lord
jesus
invitation
is
so
different
from
that
of
the
man
at
that
when
the
lord
jesus
christ
says
come
he
has
always
something
good
to
give
something
that
is
solid
something
that
will
last
something
that
will
not
disappoint
you
he
has
pardon
to
give
you
he
has
peace
to
give
you
he
has
heaven
to
give
you
all
these
are
good
gifts
all
these
are
solid
all
these
will
last
not
one
of
them
will
disappoint
you
will
you
come
to
him
my
friends
he
calls
to
you
come
come
now
now
your
time
there
room
now
there
plenty
of
room
now
yet
there
is
room
it
may
be
too
late
you
not
come
to
him
whosoever
cometh
need
not
delay
now
the
door
is
open
enter
while
you
may
jesus
is
the
true
the
only
living
way
whosoever
will
may
come
whosoever
will
whosoever
will
sound
the
proclamation
over
vale
and
hill
is
a
loving
father
calls
his
children
home
whosoever
will
may
come
said
her
father
voice
quick
and
get
ready
and
rosalie
had
to
close
the
caravan
door
and
dress
for
the
play
but
the
hymn
and
the
sermon
were
treasured
up
in
the
child
heart
and
were
never
forgotten
by
her
that
was
the
last
fair
which
augustus
joyce
visited
that
year
the
cold
weather
was
coming
on
already
there
had
been
one
or
two
severe
frosts
and
the
snow
had
come
beating
down
the
caravan
chimney
almost
extinguishing
the
little
fire
augustus
thought
it
was
high
time
that
he
sought
for
winter
quarters
and
having
made
an
engagement
in
a
low
town
theatre
for
the
winter
months
he
determined
to
go
to
the
town
at
once
and
dismiss
his
company
until
the
spring
on
the
road
to
the
town
they
passed
many
other
caravans
all
bound
on
the
same
errand
coming
like
swallows
to
a
warmer
clime
rosalie
father
went
first
to
an
open
space
or
where
the
caravans
were
stowed
away
for
the
winter
here
he
left
rosalie
for
some
time
whilst
he
went
to
look
for
lodgings
in
the
town
then
he
and
the
men
removed
from
the
caravans
the
things
which
they
would
need
and
carried
them
to
their
new
quarters
when
all
was
arranged
augustus
told
the
child
to
follow
him
and
led
the
way
through
the
town
how
rosalie
wondered
to
what
kind
of
a
place
she
was
going
they
went
down
several
streets
wound
in
and
out
of
different
squares
and
courts
and
the
child
had
to
run
every
now
and
then
to
keep
up
with
her
father
long
strides
at
last
they
came
to
a
winding
street
full
of
tall
gloomy
houses
before
one
of
which
her
father
stopped
and
knocked
at
the
door
some
ragged
children
without
shoes
or
stockings
were
sitting
on
the
steps
and
moved
off
as
rosalie
and
her
father
came
up
the
door
was
opened
by
a
girl
about
fifteen
years
old
with
a
miserable
careworn
face
and
dressed
in
an
untidy
torn
frock
which
had
lost
all
its
hooks
and
was
fastened
with
large
white
pins
your
mistress
said
augustus
joyce
the
girl
led
the
way
to
the
back
of
the
house
and
opened
the
door
of
a
dismal
parlour
smelling
strongly
of
tobacco
rosalie
gazed
round
her
at
the
dirty
paper
on
the
walls
and
the
greasy
and
the
ragged
carpet
and
was
not
favourably
impressed
with
her
new
abode
there
were
some
vulgar
prints
in
equally
vulgar
frames
hanging
on
the
walls
a
bunch
of
paper
flowers
a
strange
mixture
of
pink
and
red
blue
and
green
and
orange
was
standing
on
the
table
and
several
penny
numbers
and
low
periodicals
were
lying
on
the
chairs
as
if
some
one
had
just
been
reading
them
then
the
door
opened
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
entered
she
was
an
actress
rosalie
felt
sure
of
that
the
first
moment
she
saw
her
she
was
dressed
in
a
faded
greasy
silk
dress
which
swept
up
the
dust
of
the
floor
as
she
walked
in
and
she
greeted
her
new
lodgers
with
an
overpowering
bow
she
took
rosalie
upstairs
past
several
landings
where
doors
opened
and
people
peered
out
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
new
lodger
up
to
a
little
attic
in
the
roof
which
was
to
be
rosalie
it
was
full
of
boxes
and
lumber
which
the
lady
of
the
house
had
stowed
there
to
be
out
of
the
way
but
in
one
corner
the
boxes
were
pushed
on
one
side
and
a
little
bed
was
put
up
for
the
child
to
sleep
on
and
a
basin
was
set
on
one
of
the
boxes
for
her
to
wash
in
rosalie
own
box
was
already
there
her
father
had
brought
it
up
for
her
before
she
arrived
and
she
was
pleased
to
find
that
it
was
still
uncorded
there
were
treasures
in
that
box
which
no
one
in
that
house
must
see
the
lady
of
the
house
told
rosalie
that
in
a
few
minutes
her
supper
would
be
ready
and
that
she
must
make
haste
and
come
downstairs
so
the
child
hastily
took
off
her
hat
and
jacket
and
went
down
the
numerous
stairs
to
a
room
in
the
front
of
the
house
where
tea
was
provided
for
those
lodgers
who
boarded
with
the
lady
of
the
house
the
child
was
most
thankful
when
the
meal
was
over
the
rude
coarse
jests
and
noisy
laughter
of
the
company
grated
on
her
ears
and
she
longed
to
make
her
escape
as
soon
as
she
could
she
slipped
from
her
father
side
and
crept
upstairs
to
her
little
attic
here
at
least
she
could
be
alone
and
quiet
it
was
very
cold
but
she
unfastened
the
box
and
took
out
her
mother
shawl
which
she
wrapped
tightly
round
her
then
she
opened
out
her
treasures
and
stowed
them
away
as
best
she
could
she
opened
the
locket
and
looked
at
the
sweet
girlish
face
inside
and
oh
how
she
wished
she
were
with
her
aunt
lucy
how
would
she
ever
be
able
to
keep
that
locket
safely
that
was
her
next
thought
there
was
no
key
to
the
attic
door
nor
was
there
a
key
to
her
box
how
could
she
be
sure
when
she
was
out
at
the
theatre
that
the
people
of
the
house
would
not
turn
over
the
contents
of
her
box
it
was
clear
that
the
locket
must
be
hidden
somewhere
for
rosalie
would
never
forgive
herself
if
after
her
mother
had
kept
it
safely
all
those
years
she
should
be
the
one
to
lose
it
she
sat
for
some
time
thinking
how
she
should
dispose
of
it
and
then
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
way
would
be
to
wear
it
night
and
day
round
her
neck
underneath
her
dress
and
never
on
any
account
to
let
any
one
catch
sight
of
it
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
carry
out
this
plan
to
her
satisfaction
she
tied
the
locket
carefully
up
in
a
small
parcel
in
which
she
placed
the
precious
letter
which
her
mother
had
written
to
her
aunt
lucy
and
she
concealed
the
packet
inside
her
dress
tying
it
round
her
neck
after
this
rosalie
felt
more
easy
and
took
out
her
little
articles
of
clothing
and
hung
them
on
some
nails
which
she
found
on
the
attic
door
then
she
took
from
her
pocket
her
own
little
testament
and
crept
up
to
the
window
to
read
a
few
verses
before
it
was
too
dark
the
light
was
fast
fading
and
the
lamplighter
was
going
down
the
street
lighting
the
lamps
there
was
no
time
to
lose
so
the
child
opened
her
book
and
began
to
read
all
your
care
upon
him
for
he
careth
for
you
those
were
the
first
words
which
met
her
eyes
she
repeated
them
over
and
over
again
to
herself
that
she
might
be
able
to
remember
them
when
the
attic
was
quite
dark
and
they
seemed
just
the
words
she
needed
they
were
the
good
shepherd
words
of
comfort
which
he
whispered
to
the
weary
lamb
on
his
bosom
for
as
the
shadows
grew
deeper
and
the
room
became
darker
rosalie
felt
very
lonely
and
miserable
once
she
thought
she
would
go
downstairs
to
look
for
her
father
but
whenever
she
opened
the
door
there
seemed
to
be
such
a
noise
and
clamour
below
that
she
did
not
like
to
venture
she
felt
as
if
her
mother
would
have
liked
her
to
stay
where
she
was
she
could
not
read
now
and
it
was
very
cold
indeed
in
the
attic
the
child
shivered
from
head
to
foot
and
wondered
if
the
long
hours
would
ever
pass
away
at
last
she
determined
to
get
into
bed
for
she
thought
she
should
be
warmer
there
and
hoped
she
might
get
to
sleep
but
it
was
still
early
and
sleep
seemed
far
away
and
then
rosalie
thought
of
her
text
all
your
care
upon
him
for
he
careth
for
you
all
care
that
means
care
thought
the
weary
child
own
care
your
care
all
the
care
about
losing
my
mammie
and
about
having
to
stay
in
this
noisy
house
and
about
having
to
go
and
act
in
that
wicked
theatre
and
about
having
to
take
care
of
my
locket
and
my
letter
casting
all
your
care
upon
that
means
my
own
good
shepherd
who
loves
me
so
i
wonder
what
casting
it
on
him
means
thought
little
weary
rosalie
can
i
cast
it
on
him
if
my
mammie
was
here
i
would
tell
her
all
about
it
and
ask
her
to
help
me
perhaps
that
what
i
got
to
do
to
the
good
shepherd
i
try
so
rosalie
knelt
up
in
bed
and
said
good
shepherd
plase
here
a
little
lamb
come
to
speak
to
you
please
i
very
lonely
and
my
mammie
is
dead
and
i
so
afraid
someone
will
get
my
locket
please
keep
it
safe
and
i
so
frightened
in
the
dark
in
this
wicked
house
please
take
care
of
me
and
do
let
me
get
wicked
i
want
to
love
you
dear
good
shepherd
and
i
want
to
meet
my
mammie
in
heaven
please
let
me
and
wish
my
sins
in
the
blood
of
jesus
amen
then
rosalie
lay
down
again
and
felt
much
happier
the
pain
at
her
heart
seemed
to
be
gone
careth
for
you
how
sweet
those
last
words
of
the
text
were
she
had
not
her
mother
to
care
for
her
but
the
good
shepherd
cared
for
her
he
loved
her
he
would
not
let
her
go
wrong
rosalie
was
thinking
of
this
and
repeating
her
text
again
and
again
when
she
felt
something
moving
on
the
bed
and
something
very
cold
touched
her
hand
she
started
back
blank
page
illustration
is
it
time
to
get
up
at
first
but
in
a
moment
she
found
it
was
nothing
but
the
nose
of
a
little
soft
furry
kitten
that
had
crept
in
through
the
opening
of
the
door
for
rosalie
had
left
her
door
a
little
ajar
that
she
might
get
a
ray
of
light
from
the
on
the
lower
landing
the
poor
little
kitten
was
very
cold
and
the
child
felt
that
it
was
as
lonely
and
dull
as
she
was
she
put
it
in
a
snug
place
in
her
arms
and
stroked
it
very
gently
till
the
tiny
creature
purred
softly
with
delight
rosalie
did
not
feel
so
lonely
after
the
kitten
had
come
to
her
she
had
been
lying
still
for
some
time
when
she
heard
a
step
on
the
stairs
and
her
father
voice
called
where
are
you
in
bed
said
little
rosalie
all
light
said
her
father
could
find
you
then
he
went
downstairs
and
the
child
was
once
more
alone
she
lay
stroking
the
kitten
and
wondering
if
she
should
ever
get
to
sleep
it
was
the
longest
night
she
ever
remembered
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
never
be
at
least
the
of
the
people
downstairs
the
talking
and
laughing
still
went
on
and
rosalie
thought
it
would
never
cease
but
at
last
the
weary
hours
went
by
and
the
people
seemed
to
be
going
to
bed
then
the
light
on
the
landing
was
put
out
and
all
was
quite
still
the
kitten
was
fast
asleep
and
rosalie
at
length
followed
its
example
and
dropped
into
a
peaceful
slumber
she
had
been
asleep
a
long
long
time
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
her
when
she
woke
up
suddenly
and
opening
her
eyes
she
saw
a
girl
standing
by
her
bedside
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
and
looking
at
her
curiously
it
was
the
little
servant

like

she
took

she
caught
sight
of
the
kitten
tail
peeping
out
from
rosalie
pillow
bless
you
there
that
kit
said
the
child
keeping
each
other
company
me

the
kitten

a
hit
of
quiet
said
betsey
ann
gets
nothing
but
kicks
all
day
long
and
it
got
no
mother
she
was
found
dead
in
the
last
week
it
been
pining
for
her
ever
since
little
thing
said
rosalie
and
she
held
it
closer
to
her
bosom
it
was
a
link
of
sympathy
between
her
and
the
kitten
they
were
both
motherless
and
both
pining
for
their
mother
love
she
would
pet
and
comfort
that
little
kitten
as
much
as
ever
she
could
then
betsey
ann
wished
rosalie
took
up
her
candle
and
went
to
her
own
attic
dragging
her
shoes
after
her
and
rosalie
fell
asleep
chapter
xv
life
in
the
true
to
her
promise
betsey
ann
appeared
in
the
attic
the
next
morning
at
ten
minutes
to
five
poor
girl
she
had
only
had
four
hours
sleep
and
she
rubbed
her
eyes
vigorously
to
make
herself
wide
awake
before
she
attempted
to
wake
rosalie
then
she
put
down
her
candle
on
the
box
and
looked
at
the
sleeping
child
she
was
lying
with
one
arm
under
her
cheek
and
the
other
round
the
kitten
it
seemed
a
shame
to
wake
her
but
the
precious
ten
minutes
were
going
fast
and
it
was
betsey
ann
only
chance
of
hearing
more
of
what
had
so
roused
her
curiosity
the
night
before
it
was
her
only
opportunity
of
hearing
of
some
one
who
loved
her
and
to
be
loved
was
quite
a
new
idea
to
the
workhouse
child
she
had
been
fed
and
clothed
and
provided
for
to
a
certain
extent
but
none
in
the
whole
world
had
ever
done
anything
for
betsey
ann
because
they
loved
her
that
was
an
experience
which
had
never
been
hers
and
yet
there
had
been
a
strange
fascination
to
her
in
those
words
rosalie
had
spoken
the
night
before
loves
you
so
much
she
must
hear
some
more
about
it
so
she
gave
rosalie
hand
the
hand
which
was
holding
the
kitten
a
very
gentle
tap
say
she
said
say
the
ten
minutes
are
going
the
sleepy
child
turned
over
and
said
dreamily
come
in
a
minute
father
have
you
begun
it
me
said
the
girl
me
it
betsey
ann
do
you
know
you
said
you
would
read
to
me
bless
me
i
wish
i
had
waked
you
you
look
so
tired
yes
i
remember
said
rosalie
jumping
up
i
quite
awake
now
how
many
minutes
are
there
seven
or
eight
at
most
said
betsey
ann
with
a
nod
we
must
lose
a
minute
said
the
child
pulling
her
testament
from
under
her
pillow
i
wish
i
was
a
good
scholar
like
you
said
betsey
ann
as
rosalie
quickly
turned
over
the
leaves
and
found
the
verse
she
had
fixed
on
the
night
before
for
her
first
lesson
to
the
poor
ignorant
ye
know
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
though
he
was
rich
yet
for
your
sakes
he
became
poor
that
ye
through
his
poverty
might
be
rich
that
a
beautiful
verse
said
little
rosalie
used
to
read
it
to
my
mammie
and
she
liked
it
so
much
me
about
it
said
betsey
ann
it
plain
like
for
me
ye
know
said
rosalie
how
it
begins
you
do
know
betsey
ann
but
you
will
do
soon
wo
you
yes
said
the
girl
hope
i
shall
ye
know
the
grace
i
not
quite
sure
what
grace
means
i
was
thinking
about
it
the
other
day
and
now
my
mammie
dead
i
no
one
to
ask
about
things
but
i
think
it
must
mean
love
it
seems
as
if
it
ought
to
mean
love
in
this
verse
and
he
does
love
us
you
know
betsey
ann
so
we
ca
be
far
wrong
if
we
say
it
means
love
ye
know
the
love
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
the
one
we
talked
about
last
night
the
one
who
loves
you
betsey
ann
that
though
he
was
rich
that
means
he
lived
in
heaven
my
mammie
said
and
had
ever
so
many
angels
to
wait
on
him
and
everything
he
wanted
all
bright
and
shining
yet
for
your
sakes
that
means
your
sake
betsey
ann
just
as
much
as
if
it
had
said
you
know
the
love
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
that
though
he
was
rich
yet
for
betsey
ann
sake
he
became
poor
i
never
said
betsey
ann
repeated
the
child
poor
my
mammie
said
that
he
had
a
house
and
had
to
tramp
about
from
one
place
to
another
and
had
to
work
in
a
carpenter
shop
and
used
to
be
hungry
just
like
we
are
i
never
said
betsey
ann
did
he
do
that
for
the
end
of
the
verse
rosalie
that
ye
through
his
poverty
might
be
rich
that
is
he
came
to
be
poor
and
die
that
you
might
be
rich
and
go
to
live
up
where
he
came
from
up
in
the
city
of
gold
and
have
the
angels
wait
on
you
and
live
with
him
always
up
there
betsey
ann
opened
her
eyes
wider
and
wider
in
astonishment
now
i
never
heard
the
like
why
did
nobody
never
tell
me
nothink
about
it
afore
do
know
said
rosalie
the
time
up
near
said
betsey
ann
with
a
sigh
lots
to
do
afore
missus
is
up
there
all
the
rooms
to
sweep
out
and
all
the
fires
to
light
and
all
the
breakfasts
to
set
and
all
the
boots
to
clean
you
wait
one
minute
more
asked
the
child
said
betsey
ann
you

can
wait
two
or
three
i
take
off
my
shoes
and
run
quick
downstairs
that
will
save
some
time

you
just
to
speak
to
the
lord
jesus
christ
before
you
go
said
rosalie
speak
to
him
why
bless
you
i
do
know
how
we
kneel
down
said
the
child
in
the
room
betsey
ann

see
him
and
he
hear
every
word
we
say

much

said
betsey
ann
as
she
took
off
her
slipshod
shoes
and
prepared
to
run
downstairs
word
i
wonder
nobody
never
told
me
afore
when
rosalie
went
downstairs
that
morning
she
found
her
father
and
the
lady
of
the
house
in
earnest
conversation
over
the
fireplace
in
the
best
parlour
they
stopped
talking
when
the
child
came
into
the
room
and
her
father
welcomed
her
with
a
theatrical
bow
morning
madam
he
said
to
find
that
you
have
benefited
by
your
nocturnal
slumbers
rosalie
walked
up
to
the
fire
with
the
kitten
in
her
arms
and
the
lady
of
the
house
gave
her
a
condescending
kiss
and
then
took
no
further
notice
of
her
it
was
a
strange
life
for
little
rosalie
in
the
dirty
with
no
mother
to
care
for
or
to
nurse
and
with
no
one
to
speak
kindly
to
her
all
day
long
but
poor
betsey
ann
clatter
clatter
clatter
went
those
slipshod
shoes
upstairs
and
downstairs
backwards
and
forwards
hither
and
thither
sweeping
and
dusting
and
cleaning
and
washing
up
dishes
from
morning
till
night
went
poor
betsey
ann
and
whenever
she
stopped
a
minute
her
mistress
voice
was
heard
screaming
from
the
dingy
parlour
ann
you
lazy
girl
what
are
you
after
now
that
afternoon
as
rosalie
was
sitting
reading
in
her
little
attic
she
heard
the
slipshod
shoes
coming
upstairs
and
presently
betsey
ann
entered
the
room
say
she
said
a
young
boy
wants
to
speak
to
you
below
can
you
come
rosalie
hastened
downstairs
and
found
toby
standing
in
the
passage
his
hat
in
his
hand
rosie
i
beg
pardon
he
said
i
come
to
say
toby

away
said
toby

has
sent
us
off
i
right
sorry
to
go
i
sure
i
am
are
you
going
toby
ca
tell
miss
rosie
said
he
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
i
can
get
i
suppose
dear
i
sorry
you
must
go
said
the
child
shall
forget
all
my
learning
said
toby
mournfully
i
tell
you
what
miss
rosie
i
shall
be
back
here
in
spring
master
will
take
me
on
again
if
i
turn
up
in
good
time
and
then
you
teach
me
a
bit
more
wo
you
said
rosalie
be
sure
i
will
but
toby
you
wo
forget
everything
will
you
miss
rosie
said
toby
i
wo
it
always
coming
in
my
mind
i
ca
curse
and
swear
now
as
i
used
to
do
somehow
the
bad
words
seem
as
if
they
would
choke
me
the
last
time
i
swore
it
a
many
weeks
ago
now
miss
rosie
i
was
in
a
great
passion
with
one
of
our
men
and
out
came
those
awful
words
quite
quick
before
i
thought
of
them
but
the
next
minute
miss
rosie
it
all
came
back
to
me
all
about
the
good
shepherd
and
how
he
was
looking
for
me
and
loving
me
and
i
at
that
very
time
doing
just
what
vexes
him
well
i
ran
out
of
the
caravan
and
i
tried
to
forget
it
but
somehow
it
seemed
as
if
the
good
shepherd
was
looking
at
me
quite
sorrowful
like
and
i
could
be
happy
miss
rosie
not
until
i
asked
him
to
forgive
me
and
to
help
me
never
to
do
so
no
more
so
glad
toby
said
little
rosalie
you
love
the
good
shepherd
and
do
like
to
grieve
him
i
think
he
must
have
found
you
toby
i
do
know
miss
rosie
i
hope
so
i
sure
but
now
i
must
be
off
only
i
could
go
without
bidding
you
you
been
so
good
to
me
miss
rosie
and
taught
me
all
i
know
after
this
rosalie
life
went
on
much
the
same
from
day
to
day
every
morning
she
was
waked
by
betsey
ann
touch
upon
her
hand
and
she
read
and
explained
a
fresh
verse
from
the
testament
to
the
poor
little
maid
rosalie
used
to
choose
the
verses
the
night
before
and
put
a
mark
in
the
place
so
that
she
might
begin
to
read
the
moment
she
awoke
and
thus
not
one
of
the
ten
minutes
might
be
wasted
betsey
ann
always
listened
with
open
mouth
and
eyes
and
she
did
not
listen
in
vain
a
little
ray
of
light
seemed
after
a
time
to
be
breaking
in
upon
that
poor
dark
neglected
mind
a
little
ray
of
sunshine
which
lighted
up
her
dark
dismal
life
and
made
even
poor
betsey
ann
have
something
worth
living
for
loves
me
that
was
the
one
idea
which
was
firmly
fixed
in
her
mind
loves
me
so
much
that
he
died
for
me
and
that
thought
was
enough
to
make
even
the
dismal
and
the
hard
life
seem
less
dark
and
dreary
than
they
had
done
before
slowly
very
slowly
a
change
came
over
the
girl
which
rosalie
could
not
help
noticing
she
was
gentler
than
she
used
to
be
more
quiet
and
patient
and
she
was
happier
too
she
did
not
wish
to
die
now
but
seemed
to
be
trying
to
follow
the
good
shepherd
who
had
done
so
much
for
her
these
morning
talks
with
betsey
ann
were
the
happiest
parts
of
days
she
did
not
like
the
company
she
met
in
the
large
they
were
very
noisy
and
the
child
kept
out
of
their
way
as
much
as
possible
many
of
them
were
actors
and
actresses
and
were
in
bed
till
nearly
so
the
morning
was
the
quietest
time
in
the
even
the
lady
of
the
house
herself
was
often
not
up
then
rosalie
would
sit
with
the
kitten
on
her
knee
before
the
fire
in
the
dingy
parlour
thinking
of
her
mother
and
of
her
aunt
lucy
and
putting
her
hand
every
now
and
then
inside
her
dress
that
she
might
be
quite
sure
that
her
precious
locket
and
letter
were
safe
the
poor
little
kit
had
a
happy
life
now
rosalie
always
saved
something
from
her
own
meals
for
the
motherless
little
creature
many
a
nice
saucerful
of
bread
and
milk
many
a
dainty
little
dinner
of
gravy
and
pieces
of
meat
did
the
kitten
enjoy
and
every
night
when
rosalie
went
to
bed
it
was
wrapped
up
in
a
warm
shawl
and
went
to
sleep
in
the
arms
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
wherever
rosalie
was
to
be
found
the
kitten
was
to
be
found
also
it
followed
her
upstairs
and
downstairs
it
crept
to
her
feet
when
she
sat
at
meals
it
jumped
upon
her
knee
when
she
sat
by
the
fire
it
was
her
constant
companion
everywhere
there
was
only
one
time
when
the
kitten
and
rosalie
were
separated
and
that
was
when
sue
went
to
perform
in
the
theatre
then
it
would
scamper
downstairs
after
her
as
she
went
to
the
cab
in
her
little
white
frock
it
would
watch
her
drive
away
and
wander
restlessly
about
the
house
crying
until
she
returned
no
words
can
describe
how
much
rosalie
disliked
going
to
the
theatre
now
it
was
a
low
dirty
place
and
filled
every
evening
with
very
people
rosalie
went
there
night
after
night
with
her
father
and
the
lady
of
the
house
who
was
an
actress
in
the
same
theatre
went
with
them
she
was
not
unkind
to
rosalie
but
simply
took
no
notice
of
her
but
to
rosalie
father
she
was
very
polite
she
always
gave
him
the
best
seat
in
the
dingy
parlour
and
the
chief
place
at
table
and
consulted
his
comfort
in
every
possible
way
often
when
rosalie
came
suddenly
into
the
room
she
found
her
father
and
the
lady
of
the
house
in
earnest
conversation
which
was
always
stopped
the
moment
that
the
child
entered
and
as
they
drove
together
in
the
cab
to
the
theatre
many
whispered
words
passed
between
them
of
which
rosalie
heard
enough
to
make
her
feel
quite
sure
that
her
father
and
the
lady
of
the
house
were
on
the
best
of
terms
and
so
the
weeks
and
months
passed
by
and
the
time
drew
near
when
the
days
would
be
long
and
light
again
and
her
father
engagement
at
the
theatre
would
end
and
he
would
set
out
on
his
summer
rounds
to
all
the
fairs
in
the
country
rosalie
was
eagerly
looking
forward
to
this
time
she
was
longing
to
get
out
of
this
dark
to
have
her
own
caravan
to
herself
where
she
might
read
and
pray
undisturbed
to
breathe
once
more
the
pure
country
air
to
see
the
flowers
and
the
birds
and
the
trees
again
and
to
see
poor
old
toby
and
to
continue
his
to
all
this
rosalie
looked
forward
with
pleasure
but
betsey
ann
grew
very
mournful
as
the
time
drew
near
she
would
say
again
and
again
shall
i
do
without
you
whoever
shall
i
find
to
read
to
me
then
and
the
slipshod
shoes
dragged
more
heavily
at
the
thought
and
the
eyes
of
poor
betsey
ann
filled
with
tears
yet
she
knew
now
that
even
when
rosalie
went
away
the
good
shepherd
loved
her
and
would
be
with
her
still
chapter
xvi
a
dark
time
one
morning
when
rosalie
was
upstairs
in
her
attic
reading
quietly
to
herself
the
door
opened
softly
and
betsey
ann
came
in
with
a
very
troubled
look
in
her
face
and
sat
down
on
one
of
the
boxes
the
matter
betsey
ann
asked
the
child
me

said
the
girl
real
sorry

as
she

child
sobs

i

rosalie
you

betsey
ann
real
sorry
i
am
said
the
girl
as
she
went
downstairs
a
great
strong
thing
but
she
such
a
weakly
little
darling
i
real
sorry
i
am
when
betsey
ann
was
gone
rosalie
was
left
to
her
own
sorrowful
meditations
all
her
dreams
of
quiet
and
peace
in
the
caravan
were
at
an
end
they
would
either
remain
in
the
large
or
if
they
went
on
their
travels
the
lady
of
the
house
would
be
also
the
lady
of
the
caravan
and
how
would
she
ever
be
able
to
keep
her
dear
letter
and
locket
safe
from
those
inquisitive
eyes
what
a
wretched
life
seemed
before
the
child
as
she
looked
on
into
the
future
she
seemed
farther
from
her
aunt
lucy
than
ever
before
and
how
would
she
ever
be
able
to
do
as
her
mother
had
asked
her
to
read
her
bible
and
pray
and
learn
more
and
more
about
the
good
shepherd
life
seemed
very
dark
and
cheerless
to
little
rosalie
the
sunshine
had
faded
from
her
sky
and
all
was
chill
and
lifeless
she
lost
hope
and
she
lost
faith
for
a
time
she
thought
the
good
shepherd
must
have
forgotten
all
about
her
to
let
this
new
trouble
come
to
her
and
she
was
very
much
afraid
that
she
would
grow
up
a
bad
woman
and
never
never
never
see
her
mother
again
when
she
had
cried
for
some
time
and
was
becoming
more
and
more
miserable
every
moment
she
stretched
out
her
hand
for
her
little
testament
to
see
if
she
could
find
anything
there
to
comfort
her
she
was
turning
quickly
over
the
leaves
not
knowing
exactly
where
to
read
when
the
word
sheep
attracted
her
attention
ever
since
the
old
man
had
given
her
the
picture
she
had
always
loved
those
texts
the
best
which
speak
of
the
lord
as
the
shepherd
and
his
children
as
the
sheep
this
was
the
one
on
which
her
eyes
fell
that
sorrowful
day
sheep
hear
my
voice
and
i
know
them
and
they
follow
me
and
i
give
unto
them
eternal
life
and
they
shall
never
perish
neither
shall
any
man
pluck
them
out
of
my
hand
the
words
seemed
to
soothe
and
comfort
the
troubled
child
even
before
she
had
thought
much
about
them
but
when
she
began
to
think
the
verses
over
word
by
word
as
was
her
custom
they
seemed
to
rosalie
to
be
everything
she
wanted
just
then
my
sheep
it
the
good
shepherd
speaking
thought
rosalie
about
his
sheep
my
sheep
he
calls
them
am
i
one
of
them
i
hope
i
am
i
have
asked
the
good
shepherd
to
find
me
and
i
think
he
has
my
sheep
hear
my
voice
oh
please
good
shepherd
said
little
rosalie
i
hear
your
voice
may
i
do
all
that
you
tell
me
and
always
try
to
please
you
and
i
know
them
i
glad
the
good
shepherd
knows
me
said
rosalie
if
he
knows
me
and
knows
all
about
me
then
he
knows
just
how
worried
and
troubled
i
am
he
knows
all
about
father
getting
married
and
the
lady
of
the
house
coming
to
live
in
our
caravan
and
he
knows
how
hard
it
is
to
do
right
when
i
only
bad
people
round
me
yes
he
knows
all
that
my
sheep
hear
my
voice
and
i
know
them
and
they
follow
me
they
follow
me
where
the
good
shepherd
goes
the
sheep
go
said
rosalie
to
herself
walks
first
and
they
walk
after
they
go
just
where
he
went
oh
dear
i
sure
i
do
think
he
ever
went
to
fairs
or
theatres
or
shows
and
i
go
can
i
be
a
sheep
after
all
but
then
i
do
want
to
go
i
do
like
going
a
bit
as
soon
as
ever
i
can
i
wo
go
any
more
and
the
good
shepherd
must
know
that
if
he
knows
his
sheep
and
i
do
want
to
follow
him
to
walk
after
him
and
only
say
and
do
what
the
good
shepherd
would
have
said
and
done
i
do
hope
i
am
a
little
sheep
though
i
do
live
in
a
caravan
but
the
second
verse
seemed
to
rosalie
even
more
beautiful
than
the
first
give
unto
them
eternal
life
she
knew
what
meant
it
meant
for
ever
and
for
ever
her
mother
had
taught
her
that
and
this
was
the
shepherd
present
to
his
sheep
eternal
life
they
were
to
live
for
ever
and
ever
it
was
a
wonderful
thought
rosalie
little
mind
could
not
quite
grasp
it
but
it
did
her
good
to
think
of
it
it
made
present
troubles
and
worries
seem
very
small
and
insignificant
if
she
was
going
to
live
for
ever
and
ever
and
ever
what
a
little
bit
of
that
long
time
would
be
spent
in
this
sorrowful
world
all
the
troubles
would
soon
be
over
she
would
not
have
to
live
in
a
caravan
in
heaven
she
would
never
be
afraid
there
of
doing
wrong
or
growing
up
wicked
oh
that
was
a
very
good
thought
the
sorrow
would
not
last
always
good
times
were
coming
for
rosalie
had
received
the
good
shepherd
present
even
eternal
life
they
shall
never
perish
neither
shall
any
man
pluck
them
out
of
my
hand
all
thought
rosalie
is
the
very
sweetest
bit
of
all
the
text
if
i
am
one
of
the
sheep
and
if
i
am
in
the
good
shepherd
hand
no
one
can
pluck
me
out
of
it
what
a
strong
hand
he
must
have
to
hold
all
his
sheep
so
fast
good
shepherd
prayed
rosalie
again
me
fast
do
let
any
one
pluck
me
out
of
thy
hand
not
father
not
the
new
mother
nor
any
of
the
people
here
please
hold
me
very
tight
i
am
so
afraid
i
only
a
little
sheep
and
i
have
no
one
to
help
me
so
please
hold
me
tighter
than
the
rest
amen
oh
how
this
prayer
lightened
little
rosalie
heart
she
rose
from
her
knees
comforted
safe
in
the
good
shepherd
hand
who
or
what
could
harm
her
it
was
well
she
had
been
thus
strengthened
and
comforted
for
a
few
minutes
afterwards
she
heard
her
father
voice
calling
her
and
going
downstairs
she
found
him
sitting
in
the
parlour
with
the
lady
of
the
house
said
her
father
with
a
theatrical
bow
me
to
introduce
you
to
your
lady
mother
he
evidently
expected
her
to
be
very
much
astonished
but
rosalie
tried
to
smile
and
gave
her
hand
to
the
lady
of
the
house
and
as
she
put
her
little
trembling
hand
in
that
of
her
new
mother
it
seemed
to
rosalie
as
if
the
good
shepherd
tightened
the
hold
of
his
hand
on
his
little
forlorn
lamb
her
father
after
a
few
heartless
remarks
about
rosalie
having
a
mother
again
dismissed
her
and
she
went
up
again
to
her
attic
but
the
very
next
day
rosalie
saw
clearly
that
betsey
ann
predictions
were
likely
to
be
fulfilled
said
her
stepmother
as
soon
as
she
came
downstairs
intend
that
you
shall
make
yourself
useful
now
i
not
going
to
have
a
daughter
of
mine
idling
away
her
time
as
you
have
been
doing
lately
fetch
some
water
and
scour
the
floor
and
when
you
done
that
plenty
more
for
you
to
do
know
how
to
make
girls
work
rosalie
thought
she
could
very
easily
believe
that
her
father
was
standing
by
and
only
laughed
at
what
his
wife
said
will
do
her
good
rosalie
heard
him
say
as
she
went
out
of
the
room
wants
a
bit
of
hard
work
and
a
bit
of
hard
work
rosalie
certainly
had
it
was
difficult
to
say
whether
she
or
betsey
ann
had
the
more
to
do
perhaps
rosalie
life
was
the
harder
for
every
night
she
had
to
go
weary
and
footsore
as
she
was
to
the
theatre
and
take
her
usual
part
in
the
play
and
when
she
came
home
at
night
she
was
so
worn
out
that
she
could
hardly
drag
herself
up
to
the
attic
to
bed
but
the
hard
work
was
not
what
rosalie
minded
most
there
was
from
morning
till
night
without
one
single
word
of
praise
and
encouragement
there
were
unkind
cruel
words
and
even
blows
to
bear
but
what
was
worse
than
all
these
was
that
the
child
had
to
wait
upon
many
of
the
rude
and
noisy
and
wicked
lodgers
and
heard
and
saw
much
very
much
that
was
so
bad
and
unholy
that
the
very
thought
of
it
made
her
shudder
as
she
knelt
at
night
to
pray
in
her
little
attic
would
she
ever
be
kept
from
harm
in
this
dreadful
place
sometimes
little
rosalie
felt
as
if
she
would
sink
under
it
but
the
good
shepherd
hand
was
around
her
and
she
was
kept
safe
no
one
could
pluck
her
out
of
that
hand
no
evil
thing
could
touch
her
the
good
shepherd
little
sheep
was
perfectly
safe
in
his
almighty
grasp
rosalie
saw
very
little
of
her
father
at
this
time
he
was
out
nearly
all
the
afternoon
only
coming
home
in
time
to
go
with
them
to
the
theatre
at
night
and
then
when
the
performance
was
over
he
often
did
not
go
home
with
his
wife
and
rosalie
but
sent
them
off
in
a
cab
and
went
with
one
of
his
friends
in
another
direction
where
they
went
rosalie
never
knew
she
feared
it
was
to
one
of
the
which
stood
at
the
corner
of
almost
every
street
in
that
crowded
neighbourhood
and
rosalie
never
knew
when
her
father
returned
home
he
had
a
and
let
himself
in
after
all
in
the
house
were
asleep
and
rosalie
saw
him
no
more
until
the
next
day
when
he
would
come
downstairs
in
a
very
bad
temper
with
every
one
she
was
often
unhappy
about
him
and
would
have
done
anything
she
could
to
make
him
think
about
his
soul
but
it
seemed
of
no
use
speaking
to
him
ever
since
his
wife
death
he
had
appeared
quite
hardened
as
if
he
had
buried
his
last
convictions
of
sin
in
her
grave
augustus
joyce
had
resisted
the
spirit
of
god
and
that
spirit
seemed
to
strive
with
him
no
longer
the
good
shepherd
had
longed
and
yearned
to
find
him
but
the
wayward
wanderer
had
refused
to
hear
his
voice
he
had
preferred
the
far
country
and
wilderness
of
sin
to
the
safe
folds
and
the
shepherd
arms
he
had
hardened
his
heart
to
all
that
would
have
made
him
better
and
for
the
last
time
had
turned
away
from
the
tender
mercies
of
god
one
night
when
rosalie
had
gone
to
bed
with
the
kitten
beside
her
on
the
pillow
and
had
fallen
asleep
from
very
weariness
and
exhaustion
she
was
startled
by
a
hand
laid
on
her
shoulder
and
betsey
ann
voice
saying
rosalie
what
can
it
be
she
started
up
quickly
and
saw
betsey
ann
standing
beside
her
looking
very
frightened
she
said
you
hear
it
what
asked
the
child
i
was
fast
asleep
said
betsey
ann
i
woke
all
of
a
minute
and
i
heard
the
ring

sure
said
rosalie
heard
nothing
said
betsey
ann
missis
does
seem
to
have
heard
every
been
asleep
a
long
time
but
then
you
see
i
have
to
go
so
fast
to
open
it
when
it
rings
in
the
day
i
expect
the
sound
of
it
would
make
me
jump
up
if
i
was
ever
so
fast
asleep
you
quite
sure
betsey
ann
said
rosalie
once
more
but
she
had
hardly
spoken
the
words
before
the
bell
rang
again
very
loudly
and
left
no
doubt
about
it
you
mind
coming
with
me
rosalie
said
betsey
ann
as
she
prepared
to
go
downstairs
not
at
all
said
the
child
not
afraid
so
the
two
girls
hastily
put
on
their
clothes
and
went
downstairs
just
as
they
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
the
steep
staircase
the
bell
rang
again
louder
than
before
and
the
lady
of
the
house
came
on
the
landing
to
see
what
it
was
said
betsey
ann
the
house

me
and
rosalie
are
just
going
to
open
the
door

nothing

should
think
said
she
will
be
some
one
who
has
arrived
by
the
train
and
has
come
to
the
wrong
door
whilst
they
were
talking
the
bell
rang
again
more
violently
than
before
and
betsey
ann
opened
the
door
it
was
a
dark
night
but
she
could
see
a
man
standing
on
the
doorstep
this
mrs
joyce
he
inquired
said
the
girl

the
man
her
to

if

quick
i
a
mate
of
joyce
and
i
was
passing
at
the
time
rosalie
stood
as
if
she
had
been
stunned
unable
to
speak
or
move
whilst
betsey
ann
went
upstairs
to
tell
her
mistress
all
along
of
that
drink
said
the
man
more
as
if
talking
to
himself
than
to
rosalie
an
awful
thing
is
drink
he
never
saw
the
van
nor
heard
it
but
rolled
right
under
the
wheels
i
was
passing
by
i
was
and
i
said
to
myself
that
joyce
so
i
followed
him
to
the
infirmary
and
came
to
tell
his
wife
dear
me

a
bad
job
it
is
in
a
few
minutes
augustus
joyce
came
downstairs
dressed
to
go
out
rosalie
ran
up
to
her
and
begged
to
go
with
her
but
she
was
ordered
to
go
back
to
bed
and
her
stepmother
hastened
out
with
the
man
what
a
long
night
that
seemed
to
rosalie
how
she
longed
for
morning
to
dawn
and
lay
awake
straining
her
ears
for
any
sound
which
might
tell
her
that
her
stepmother
had
returned
at
length
as
the
grey
morning
light
was
stealing
into
the
room
the
rang
again
and
betsey
ann
went
to
open
the
door
for
her
mistress
rosalie
felt
as
if
she
did
not
dare
to
go
downstairs
to
hear
what
had
happened
presently
the
slipshod
shoes
came
slowly
upstairs
and
betsey
ann
came
into
the
attic
me
said
the
child
is
it
dead
said
betsey
ann
solemnly
was
dead
when
she
got
there
he
never
knew
nothing
after
the
wheels
went
over
him
is
it
awful
though
little
rosalie
could
not
speak
and
could
not
cry
she
sat
quite
still
and
motionless
what
of
her
father
soul
that
was
the
thought
uppermost
in
her
mind
oh
where
was
he
now
was
his
soul
safe
could
she
have
any
hope
even
the
faintest
that
he
was
with
her
mother
in
the
bright
home
above
it
was
a
terrible
end
to
augustus
joyce
ungodly
and
sinful
life
cut
off
in
the
midst
of
his
sins
with
no
time
for
repentance
no
time
to
take
his
heavy
load
of
guilt
to
the
saviour
whose
love
he
had
scorned
and
rejected
oh
how
often
had
he
been
called
and
invited
by
the
good
shepherd
voice
of
love
but
he
would
not
hearken
and
now
it
was
too
late
chapter
xvii
alone
in
the
world
it
was
the
day
after
her
father
funeral
rosalie
was
busily
engaged
sweeping
the
high
staircase
when
her
stepmother
came
out
of
the
dingy
parlour
and
called
to
the
child
to
come
down
as
soon
as
rosalie
entered
the
room
joyce
told
her
to

the
door
and
then
asked

in
a
sharp
voice

ann
do
you
know
said
betsey
ann
was
a
woman
in
the
workhouse

she
often
told
us
of
how
she
walked
the
distance
on
a
cold
snowy
day
it
fourteen
or
fifteen
miles
i
think
that
the
town
said
rosalie
the
old

my
picture
and
it
was
the
first
village
we
passed
through
after

where
my

about
five
miles
farther
than

rosalie
said
betsey
ann
near
upon
twenty
miles
never
be
able
to
walk
all
that
way
yes
said
the
child
must
try
because
if
once
i

there
oh
betsey
ann
just
think
if
once
i
get
there
to
my
own
dear
aunt
lucy
but
betsey
ann
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
began
to

she
said
as
rosalie
tried
to
comfort
her

it
will
be
all
right
but
oh
dear
me
to
think

said
the
child
as
she
laid
her
little
hand
on
the
girl
rough
hair

i
do
i
know
it
all
right
rosalie
it
better
than

think

the
good
shepherd
rosalie
and
ask
him
to
look
after
me
a
bit
when

the
child

tell
him
now
so
they
knelt
down
hand
in
hand
on
the
attic
floor
and
rosalie
prayed
good
shepherd
i
am
going
away
please
take
care
of
betsey
ann
and

her
and
help
her

lucy
and
if
betsey
ann
and
i
never

in
this
world
please
may
we
meet
in
heaven
amen
then
they
rose
from
their
knees
comforted
and
began
to
make
preparations
for
rosalie
departure
she
would
take
very
little
with
her
for
she
had
so
far
to
walk
that
she
could
not
carry
much
she
filled
a
very
small
bag
with
the
things
that
she
needed
most
and
wrapped
her
little
testament
up
and
put
it
in
the
centre
with
the
small
pair
of
blue
shoes
which
had
belonged
to
her
little
brother
her
picture
too
was
not
forgotten
nor
the
card
with
the
hymn
upon
it
when
all
was
ready
they
went
to
bed
but
neither
of
them
could
sleep
much
that
night
as
soon
as
it
was
light
rosalie
prepared
to
start
she
wrapped
herself
in
her
mother
warm
shawl
for
it
was
a
raw
chilly
morning
and
took
her
little
bag
in
her
hand
then
she
went
into
betsey
ann
attic
to
say
am
i
to
tell
the
missis
when
she
asks
where
you
gone
said
the
girl
can
say
dear
that
i
gone
to
my
mother
relations
and
am
not
coming
back
any
more
she
wo
ask
any
more
if
you
say
that
she
only
be
too
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
but
i
rather
she
did
know
where
my
aunt
lucy
lives
so
do
say
anything
about
it
please
betsey
ann
unless
you
obliged
the
girl
promised
and
then
with
many
tears
they
took
leave
of
each
other
just
as
rosalie
was
starting
and
betsey
ann
was
opening
the
door
for
her
she
caught
sight
of
something
very
black
and
soft
under
the
child
large
shawl
bless
me
she
cried
that
only
the
poor
little
kit
said
rosalie
could
leave
her
behind
she
took
a
piece
of
fish
the
other
day
and
the
mistress
was
so
angry
and
is
going
to
give
her
poison
she
said
last
night
she
would
poison
my
kit
she
called
out
after
me
as
i
went
out
of
the
room
two
pieces
of
rubbish
got
rid
of
in
one
day
shall
go
to
the
workhouse
and
that
wretched
little
thief
of
a
kitten
shall
be
poisoned
and
then
she
laughed
betsey
ann
so
i
could
leave
my
dear
little
kit
behind
could
i
and
rosalie
stroked
its
black
fur
very
lovingly
as
she
spoke
how
will
you
ever
carry
it
rosalie
it
wo
be
good
all
that
way
rolled
up
like
that
i
shall
manage
dear
it
will
walk
a
bit
when
we
get
in
the
country
it
follows
me
just
like
a
dog
what
are
you
going
to
eat
on
the
way
rosalie
let
me
fetch
you
a
bit
of
something
out
of
the
pantry
no
dear
said
rosalie
decidedly
wo
take
anything
because
it
is
mine
but
i
have
a
piece
of
bread
that
i
saved
from
breakfast
and
i
have
twopence
which
my
father
gave
me
once
so
i
shall
manage
till
i
get
there
so
rosalie
went
out
into
the
great
world
alone
and
betsey
ann
stood
at
the
door
to
watch
her
go
down
the
street
over
and
over
again
did
rosalie
come
back
to
say
over
and
over
again
did
she
turn
round
to
kiss
her
hand
to
the
poor
little
who
was
watching
her
down
the
street
and
then
when
she
turned
the
corner
and
could
no
longer
see
betsey
friendly
face
rosalie
felt
really
alone
the
streets
looked
very
wide
and
dismal
then
and
rosalie
felt
that
she
was
only
a
little
girl
and
had
no
one
to
take
care
of
her
and
then
she
looked
up
to
the
blue
sky
and
asked
the
good
shepherd
to
help
her
and
to
bring
her
safely
to
her
end
it
was
about
six
when
rosalie
started
the
men
were
going
to
their
work
and
were
hurrying
quickly
past
her
rosalie
did
not
like
to
stop
any
of
them
to
ask
them
the
way
they
seemed
too
busy
to
have
time
to
speak
to
her
she
ventured
timidly
to
put
the
question
to
a
boy
of
fifteen
who
was
sauntering
along
whistling
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
but
he
only
laughed
and
asked
her
why
she
wanted
to
know
so
rosalie
walked
on
very
much
afraid
that
after
all
she
might
be
walking
in
the
wrong
direction
she
next
asked
some
children
on
a
doorstep
but
they
were
frightened
at
being
spoken
to
and
ran
indoors
then
rosalie
went
up
to
an
old
woman
who
was
opening
her
shutters
and
asked
her
if
she
would
be
so
very
good
as
to
tell
her
the
way
to
pendleton
my
dear
said
the
old
woman
up
i
deaf
but
though
rosalie
stood
on
tiptoe
to
reach
up
to
her
ear
and
shouted
again
and
again
she
could
not
make
the
old
woman
hear
and
at
last
had
to
give
it
up
and
go
on
her
way
she
was
feeling
very
lonely
now
poor
child
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
or
to
whom
to
go
for
help
true
there
wore
many
people
in
the
street
but
they
were
walking
quickly
along
and
rosalie
was
discouraged
by
her
unsuccessful
attempts
and
afraid
to
stop
them
she
had
come
some
way
from
the
street
in
which
she
had
lived
with
her
stepmother
and
had
never
been
in
this
part
of
the
town
before
she
was
feeling
very
faint
and
hungry
from
having
come
so
far
before
breakfast
but
she
did
not
like
to
eat
her
one
piece
of
bread
for
she
would
need
it
so
much
more
later
in
the
day
but
she
broke
off
a
small
piece
and
gave
it
to
the
poor
hungry
little
kit
which
was
mewing
under
her
shawl
thought
rosalie
i
only
had
some
one
to
help
me
just
one
to
show
me
where
to
go
and
what
to
do
there
was
a
story
which
the
child
had
read
in
her
little
testament
which
came
suddenly
into
her
mind
just
then
it
was
a
story
of
the
good
shepherd
when
he
was
on
earth
the
story
told
how
he
sent
two
of
his
disciples
into
the
city
of
jerusalem
to
find
a
place
for
him
and
them
where
they
might
eat
the
passover
the
two
men
did
not
know
to
which
house
to
go
they
did
not
know
who
in
the
great
city
of
jerusalem
would
be
willing
to
give
a
room
but
jesus
told
them
that
as
soon
as
they
came
inside
the
city
gate
they
would
see
a
man
walking
before
them
he
told
them
the
man
would
be
carrying
a
pitcher
of
water
and
that
when
they
saw
this
man
they
were
to
follow
him
and
go
down
just
the
same
streets
as
he
did
he
told
them
that
by
and
by
the
man
would
stop
in
front
of
a
house
and
go
into
the
house
and
then
when
they
saw
him
go
in
they
were
to
know
that
that
was
the
right
house
the
house
in
which
they
were
to
eat
the
passover
rosalie
remembered
this
story
now
as
she
stood
at
the
corner
of
a
street
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
how
she
wished
that
a
man
with
a
pitcher
of
water
would
appear
and
walk
in
front
of
her
that
she
might
know
which
way
to
go
but
though
she
looked
up
and
down
the
street
she
saw
no
one
at
all
like
the
man
in
the
story
there
were
plenty
of
men
but
none
of
them
had
pitchers
nor
did
they
seem
at
all
likely
to
guide
her
into
the
right
way
but
the
good
shepherd
was
the
same
rosalie
thought
as
kind
now
as
he
was
then
so
she
spoke
to
him
in
her
heart
in
a
very
earnest
little
prayer
good
shepherd
please
send
me
a
man
with
a
pitcher
of
water
to
show
me
the
way
for
i
am
very
unhappy
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
amen
chapter
xviii
the
little
pitcher
rosalie
had
shut
her
eyes
as
she
said
her
little
prayer
and
when
she
opened
them
she
saw
before
her
a
little
girl
about
five
years
old
in
a
very
clean
print
frock
and
white
pinafore
with
a
pitcher
in
her
hand
rosalie
almost
felt
as
if
she
had
fallen
from
heaven
she
was
not
a
man
to
be
sure
and
the
pitcher
was
filled
full
of
milk
and
not
water
yet
it
seemed
very
strange
that
she
should
come
up
just
then
the
little
girl
was
gazing
up
into
rosalie
face
and
wondering
why
she
was
shutting
her
eyes
as
soon
as
rosalie
opened
them
she
said
will
you
open
our
for
me
i
afraid
of
spilling
the
milk
rosalie
turned
round
and
behind
where
she
was
standing
was
a
very
small
shop
in
the
window
were
children
slates
and
with
coloured
paper
twisted
round
them
and
a
few
wooden
tops
and
balls
of
string
and
little
boxes
of
ninepins
and
a
basket
full
of
marbles
and
pink
and
blue
shuttlecocks
it
was
a
very
quiet
little
shop
indeed
and
it
looked
as
if
very
few
customers
ever
entered
it
the
and
battledores
and
marbles
looked
as
if
they
had
stood
in
exactly
the
same
places
long
before
the
little
girl
was
born
rosalie
lifted
the
latch
and
opened
the
door
of
the
little
shop
for
the
child
to
go
in
and
the
little
pitcher
went
in
before
her
rosalie
felt
sure
she
must
follow
it
and
that
here
she
would
find
some
one
to
tell
her
the
way
said
a
voice
from
the
next
room
popsey
is
that

grannie
said
the
child
i
not
spilt
a
drop
not
one
single
drop
grannie
a
good
clever
little
popsey
said
grannie
coming
out
of
the
back
parlour
to
take
the
milk
from
the
child
hands
said
rosalie
seizing
the
opportunity
you
be
so
very
kind
as
to
tell
me
the
way
to
pendleton

be
sure
said
the
old
woman
not
far

here

the
first
turn
to
the
right
and
you
find
yourself
on
the
pendleton
road

weakly

a

but
i
was
keeping
it
till
i
got
out
of
the
town
called
out
the
old
woman
here
rosalie
could
hear
a
chair
being
pushed
from
the
table
on
the
stone
floor
in
the
kitchen
and
the
next
moment
a
little
old
man
came
into
the
shop
with
spectacles
on
his
nose
a
blue
handkerchief
tied
round
his
neck
and
a
black
velvet
waistcoat
ye

jonathan
said
his
wife

and
never

bite
of

all
this
blessed
day
what

jonathan

said
the
old
man
breakfast
all
ready
and
the
coffee
will
be
cold
so
do
i
jonathan
said
the
old
woman
come
along
child
and
have
a
sup
before
you
start
the
next
minute
found
rosalie
seated
by
the
round
table
in
the
little
back
kitchen
with
a
cup
of
steaming
coffee
and
a
slice
of
hot
cake
before
her
such
a
cosy
little
kitchen
it
was
with
a
bright
fire
burning
in
the
grate
and
another
hot
cake
standing
on
the
top
of
the
oven
to
be
kept
hot
until
it
was
wanted
the
fireirons
shone
like
silver
and
everything
in
the
room
was
as
neat
and
clean
and
bright
as
it
was
possible
for
them
to
be
popsey
was
sitting
on
a
high
chair
between
the
old
man
and
woman
and
the
pitcher
of
milk
was
just
in
front
of
her
she
had
been
pouring
some
of
it
into
her
grandfather
coffee
the
old
man
was
very
attentive
to
rosalie
and
wanted
her
to
eat
of
everything
on
the
table
he
had
heard
what
she
had
told
the
old
woman
in
the
shop
for
the
kitchen
was
so
near
that
every
word
could
be
heard
distinctly
but
before
rosalie
would
eat
a
morsel
herself
she
said
looking
up
in
the
old
woman
face
may
my
little
kit
have
something
to
eat
it
so
very
very
hungry
little
kit
exclaimed
the
old
woman
what
do
you
mean
child
where
is
it
but
the
kitten
answered
this
question
by
peeping
out
from
the
shawl
they
were
all
very
much
astonished
to
see
it
but
when
rosalie
told
its
story
and
the
old
woman
heard
that
it
was
motherless
like
popsey
it
received
a
warm
welcome
the
pitcher
of
milk
was
emptied
for
the
hungry
kitten
and
when
its
breakfast
was
over
it
sat
purring
in
front
of
the
bright
fire
it
was
a
very
cosy
little
party
and
they
all
enjoyed
themselves
very
much
rosalie
thought
she
had
never
tasted
such
good
cakes
nor
drunk
such
delicious
coffee
popsey
was
delighted
with
the
kitten
and
wanted
to
give
all
her
breakfast
to
it
when
breakfast
was
over
popsey
got
down
from
her
high
chair
and
went
to
a
chest
of
drawers
which
stood
in
a
corner
near
the
fireplace
it
was
a
very
chest
of
drawers
and
on
the
top
of
it
were
arranged
some
equally
books
in
the
middle
of
these
was
a
large
family
bible
popsey
put
a
chair
against
the
chest
of
drawers
and
standing
on
tiptoe
on
it
brought
down
the
bible
from
its
place
it
was
almost
as
much
as
she
could
lift
but
she
put
both
her
arms
round
it
and
carried
it
to
her
grandfather
the
old
man
cleared
a
space
for
it
on
the
table
and
laid
it
before
him
then
looking
up
at
the
old
woman
he
said
you
ready
grandmother
to
which
the
old
woman
answered
jonathan
quite
ready
and
pushed
her
chair
a
little
way
from
the
table
and
folded
her
arms
rosalie
followed
her
example
and
did
the
same
popsey
had
seated
herself
on
a
wooden
stool
at
her
grandfather
feet
then
there
was
a
pause
in
which
the
old
man
took
an
extra
pair
of
spectacles
from
a
leathern
case
fixed
them
on
his
nose
and
turned
over
the
leaves
of
his
bible
and
then
when
he
had
found
his
place
he
began
to
read
a
psalm
the
psalm
might
have
been
chosen
on
purpose
for
rosalie
she
almost
started
when
the
old
man
began
lord
is
my
shepherd
i
shall
not
want
that
was
the
first
verse
of
the
psalm
and
it
went
on
to
tell
how
the
shepherd
leads
his
sheep
into
green
pastures
and
makes
them
to
lie
down
beside
still
waters
and
how
the
sheep
need
fear
no
evil
for
he
is
with
them
his
rod
and
his
staff
they
comfort
them
then
when
he
had
finished
reading
the
old
man
offered
up
a
very
suitable
little
prayer
in
which
rosalie
and
popsey
were
both
named
and
committed
to
the
shepherd
care
and
then
when
they
rose
from
their
knees
rosalie
felt
it
was
high
time
she
should
go
on
her
journey
but
the
old
woman
would
not
hear
of
her
going
till
she
had
wrapped
up
all
that
was
left
of
the
cake
in
a
little
parcel
and
slipped
it
into
the
child
bag
after
this
they
all
three
the
old
man
the
old
woman
and
popsey
went
to
the
door
to
see
rosalie
start
popsey
could
hardly
tear
herself
from
the
kitten
and
the
old
woman
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
stop
kissing
rosalie
but
at
length
the
were
over
and
the
child
set
off
once
more
on
her
travels
feeling
warmed
and
comforted
and
strengthened
it
was
about
eight
now
so
there
was
no
time
to
lose
she
easily
found
the
pendleton
road
and
the
old
man
had
directed
her
when
she
found
it
to
go
straight
on
turning
neither
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
till
she
reached
pendleton
itself
she
would
pass
through
several
villages
he
said
but
she
was
not
to
turn
aside
in
any
direction
so
rosalie
had
no
further
anxiety
about
the
way
she
was
to
go
all
she
had
to
do
was
to
walk
along
as
quickly
as
possible
the
first
part
of
the
road
lay
through
the
outskirts
of
the
town
on
either
side
of
the
way
were
rows
of
houses
and
small
shops
and
every
now
and
then
a
patch
of
field
or
garden
by
degrees
the
houses
and
shops
became
fewer
and
the
patches
of
field
and
garden
became
more
numerous
and
then
after
a
time
the
houses
disappeared
altogether
and
there
was
nothing
on
both
sides
of
the
road
but
fields
and
gardens
the
sun
was
shining
now
and
the
hedges
were
covered
with
wild
roses
over
rosalie
head
there
was
a
lark
singing
in
and
by
the
side
of
the
path
grew
the
small
pink
flowers
of
the
wild
convolvulus
rosalie
could
not
help
stopping
to
gather
some
sprays
of
this
and
to
twist
them
round
her
hat
it
was
so
many
months
since
she
had
seen
any
flowers
and
they
brought
the
old
days
back
to
her
when
toby
used
to
put
her
down
from
the
caravan
that
she
might
gather
the
flowers
for
her
mother
for
the
first
few
miles
rosalie
enjoyed
her
walk
very
much
everything
was
so
bright
and
pleasant
every
now
and
then
she
put
the
kitten
on
the
ground
and
it
ran
by
her
side
then
the
child
sat
on
a
bank
and
ate
the
cake
which
popsey
grandmother
had
given
her
and
the
little
black
kit
had
benjamin
share
of
the
little
entertainment
but
as
the
day
went
on
the
poor
little
kit
became
tired
and
would
walk
no
more
and
rosalie
grew
tired
also
her
feet
went
very
slowly
now
and
she
felt
afraid
that
night
would
come
on
long
before
she
reached
pendleton
then
the
sun
was
hidden
by
clouds
and
wind
began
to
sweep
through
the
trees
and
blew
against
the
child
so
that
she
could
hardly
make
any
way
against
it
and
then
came
the
rain
only
a
few
drops
at
first
then
quicker
and
quicker
till
rosalie
shawl
became
wet
through
and
her
clothes
clung
heavily
to
her
ankles
still
on
she
walked
very
heavily
and
wearily
and
the
rain
poured
on
and
the
kitten
shivered
under
the
shawl
rosalie
did
her
very
best
to
keep
it
warm
and
every
now
and
then
she
stroked
its
wet
fur
and
spoke
a
word
of
comfort
to
it
how
wearily
the
child
little
feet
pressed
on
as
she
struggled
against
the
cold
and
piercing
wind
how
would
she
ever
reach
the
town
how
would
she
ever
hold
on
till
she
arrived
at
her
aunt
lucy
chapter
xix
skirrywinks
rosalie
was
almost
in
despair
almost
ready
to
give
up
and
sit
down
by
the
roadside
when
she
heard
a
sound
behind
her
it
was
the
rumbling
sound
of
wheels
and
in
another
minute
rosalie
saw
coming
up
to
her
two
large
caravans
so
illustration
a
rest
by
the
wayside
blank
page
like
the
caravan
in
which
she
used
to
travel
with
her
mother
that
the
child
felt
as
if
she
were
dreaming
as
she
looked
at
them
the
caravans
were
painted
a
brilliant
yellow
just
as
her
father
caravans
used
to
be
and
there
were
muslin
curtains
and
pink
bows
in
the
little
windows
just
like
those
through
which
she
had
so
often
peeped
when
the
caravans
came
up
to
rosalie
she
saw
a
woman
standing
at
the
door
of
the
first
one
and
talking
to
the
man
who
was
driving
the
woman
caught
sight
of
the
child
as
soon
as
they
overtook
her
she
called
out
are
you
off
to
said
rosalie
going
to
pendleton
if
only
i
can
get
there
her
a
lift
john
thomas
said
the
woman
the
child
a
lift
it
an
awful
day
to
be
struggling
along
against
wind
and
storm
right
said
john
thomas
pulling
up
no
objections
if
the
lass
likes
to
get
in
rosalie
was
very
grateful
indeed
for
this
offer
and
climbed
at
once
into
the
caravan
the
woman
opened
the
door
for
her
and
took
off
her
wet
shawl
as
she
went
in
you
got
a
kitten
there
she
said
as
she
did
so
are
you
taking
it
to
it
half
drowned
with
the
rain
poor
little
kit
said
rosalie
must
try
to
dry
it
it
is
so
cold
i
make
a
place
for
both
of
you
near
the
fire
said
the
woman
only
my
children
will
get
out
of
the
way
rosalie
looked
in
vain
for
any
children
in
the
caravan
but
the
woman
pointed
to
a
large
black
dog
a
pigeon
and
a
kitten
which
were
sitting
together
on
the
floor
skirrywinks
said
the
woman
addressing
herself
to
the
kitten
to
me
as
soon
as
she
said
the
kitten
which
had
appeared
to
be
asleep
before
lifted
up
its
head
and
jumped
on
her
knee
the
great
black
dog
was
ordered
to
the
other
end
of
the
caravan
and
the
pigeon
perched
upon
the
dog
head
then
the
woman
gave
rosalie
a
seat
near
the
little
stove
and
the
child
warmed
her
hands
and
dried
and
comforted
her
poor
little
kitten
no
words
can
tell
how
thankful
she
was
for
this
help
on
her
way
she
felt
sure
that
john
thomas
must
be
a
man
with
a
pitcher
of
water
sent
to
help
her
on
her
journey
for
some
time
the
woman
leant
out
of
the
caravan
continuing
her
conversation
with
her
husband
and
rosalie
was
able
to
look
about
her
the
inside
of
the
caravan
was
very
like
that
in
which
she
had
been
born
and
had
lived
so
many
years
there
was
a
little
just
like
that
which
her
mother
had
used
and
in
the
corner
was
a
large
cupboard
filled
with
cups
and
saucers
and
plates
just
like
the
one
which
rosalie
herself
had
arranged
so
often
but
what
struck
her
more
than
anything
else
was
that
on
the
side
of
the
caravan
was
nailed
up
her
picture
the
picture
of
the
good
shepherd
and
the
sheep
it
was
exactly
the
same
picture
and
the
same
text
was
underneath
it
with
me
for
i
have
found
my
sheep
which
was
lost
is
joy
in
the
presence
of
the
angels
of
god
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
rosalie
could
not
help
feeling
in
her
bag
to
be
sure
that
her
own
picture
was
safe
so
precisely
did
the
picture
on
the
wall
resemble
it
the
picture
seemed
to
have
hung
there
for
some
time
for
it
was
very
smoky
and
discoloured
but
still
it
looked
very
beautiful
rosalie
thought
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
gazed
at
it
oh
how
it
brought
her
mother
dream
to
her
mind
and
carried
her
thoughts
away
from
the
caravan
to
the
home
above
where
even
now
perhaps
her
mother
was
being
called
by
the
good
shepherd
to
rejoice
with
him
over
some
sheep
which
was
lost
but
which
the
good
shepherd
had
found
again
when
the
woman
put
her
head
into
the
caravan
she
began
to
talk
to
rosalie
to
ask
her
where
she
had
come
from
and
where
she
was
going
and
what
she
was
going
to
do
she
seemed
a
friendly
woman
though
she
spoke
in
a
rough
voice
all
the
time
she
was
talking
skirrywinks
was
sitting
on
her
shoulder
and
the
pigeon
on
her
head
rosalie
kitten
seemed
afraid
of
the
large
black
dog
and
crept
into
the
child
arms
when
they
had
chatted
together
for
some
time
rosalie
ventured
to
mention
the
picture
saying
that
it
seemed
so
strange
to
see
it
here
for
that
she
had
one
exactly
like
it
have
you
said
the
woman
jinx
picture
an
old
man
gave
it
to
him
just
a
year
ago
it
will
be
it
was
at
pendleton
fair
that
where
i
got
mine
said
rosalie
must
be
the
same
old
man
should
say
it
was
said
the
woman
came
to
the
caravans
on
a
sunday
afternoon
yes

the
same
old
man
said
rosalie

my
picture
here
in
my
bag
i
would
ever
part
with
it

said
the
woman
i
do
believe
jinx
would
he
nailed
it
up
that
very
sunday
and
there
it
been
ever
since
jinx
asked
rosalie
our
boy

least

with
us

and
john
thomas

any
children

our
own
so

few

he

of
them
and
then
there
skirrywinks
and
tozer
and
spanco
and
then
jeremiah
you
have
seen
jeremiah
he
in
bed
you
see
him
when
jinx
comes
is
jinx
asked
rosalie
almost
expecting
he
would
turn
out
to
be
some
kind
of
animal
which
was
hidden
away
in
a
corner
of
the
caravan
he
in
the
next
van
with
lord
fatimore
said
the
woman
be
here
soon
when
it
time
for
these
young
people
to
be
fed
and
trained
he
very
clever
is
jinx
you
never
saw
any
one
so
clever
in
all
your
life
i
be
bound
he
can
make
do
anything
we
might
just
as
well
shut
up
if
we
had
jinx
it
a
deal
more
popular
than
lord
fatimore
is
folks
say
they
never
saw
such
a
sight
as
when
jeremiah
and
skirrywinks
dance
the
polka
together
and
it
all
jinx
that
has
taught
them
in
about
half
an
hour
the
caravans
were
stopped
and
the
wonderful
jinx
arrived
he
was
very
short
not
taller
than
rosalie
he
was
so
humpbacked
that
he
seemed
to
have
no
neck
at
all
and
he
had
a
very
old
and
wizened
and
careworn
face
it
was
hard
to
tell
whether
he
was
a
man
or
a
boy
he
was
so
small
in
stature
and
yet
so
sunken
and
shrivelled
in
appearance
said
the
woman
as
he
entered
a
young
lady
come
to
your
performance
happy
miss
said
jinx
with
a
bow
the
moment
that
he
came
into
the
caravan
skirrywinks
and
the
dog
sat
on
their
hind
legs
and
the
pigeon
alighted
on
his
head
as
soon
as
he
spoke
rosalie
heard
a
noise
in
a
basket
behind
her
as
of
something
struggling
to
get
out
hear
you
jeremiah
said
jinx
shall
come
you
shall
he
took
the
basket
and
put
his
hand
inside
jeremiah
he
said
jeremiah
if
i
can
find
you
jeremiah
come
out
and
show
the
company
how
you
put
on
your
new
coat
out
of
the
basket
he
brought
a
hare
which
was
wonderfully
tame
and
allowed
itself
to
be
arrayed
in
a
scarlet
jacket
and
then
jinx
made
all
the
animals
go
through
their
several
performances
after
which
each
received
his
proper
share
of
the
meal
but
skirrywinks
seemed
to
be
jinx
favourite
long
after
the
others
were
dismissed
she
sat
on
his
shoulders
watching
his
every
movement
what
do
you
think
of
them
he
said
turning
to
rosalie
when
he
had
finished
very
clever
said
the
child
clever
indeed
kit
of
yours
could
do
as
much
said
jinx
looking
scornfully
at
the
kitten
which
lay
in
rosalie
lap
said
the
child
she
a
very
dear
little
kit
though
she
jump
through
rings
nor
dance
polkas
tastes
differ
said
jinx
prefer
skirrywinks
got
a
picture
like
mine
said
rosalie
after
a
time
when
she
saw
that
jinx
seemed
inclined
to
talk
he
said
you
one
like
it
i
got
it
at
pendleton
fair
so
did
i
said
rosalie
the
same
old
man
gave
one
to
me
he
found
mr
jinx
said
rosalie
in
a
lower
voice
found
me
what
do
you
mean
said
jinx
with
a
laugh
have
you
read
the
story
about
the
picture
said
the
child
says
where
it
is
underneath
not
i
said
jinx
laughing
again
i
when
the
old
man
gave
it
to
me
it
a
pretty
picture
and
i
stick
it
on
the
wall
but
i
never
troubled
my
head
any
more
about
it
my
mother
and
i
we
read
it
nearly
every
day
said
rosalie
such
a
beautiful
story
it
said
jinx
should
like
to
hear
it
tell
it
to
me
it
will
pass
the
time
as
we
go
along
can
read
it
if
you
like
said
rosalie
have
it
here
in
a
book
right
read
on
said
jinx
graciously
rosalie
took
her
testament
from
her
bag
but
before
she
began
to
read
jinx
called
out
to
the
woman
who
was
leaning
out
of
the
caravan
talking
to
her
husband
mother
he
called
out
and
hear
the
little
read
going
to
give
us
the
history
of
that
there
picture
of
mine
you
know
nothing
about
it
i
be
bound
but
jinx
was
wrong
for
when
rosalie
had
finished
reading
the
woman
said
will
be
the
bible
you
read
out
of
i
read
that
often
when
i
was
a
girl
i
went
to
a
good
sunday
school
then
do
you
ever
read
it
now
said
rosalie
i
not
so
bad
as
you
think
said
the
woman
not
answering
her
question
think
of
all
those
things
at
times
i
a
decent
woman
in
my
way
i
know
the
bible
well
enough
and
there
a
many
a
deal
worse
than
i
am
you
would
like
said
rosalie
timidly
find
it
for
you
in
your
bible
and
then
you
can
read
it
again
as
you
used
to
do
when
you
were
a
girl
the
woman
hesitated
when
rosalie
said
this
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
got
my
bible
here
she
said
husband
sent
all
the
things
we
was
wanting
at
the
time
to
his
relations
in
scotland
and
somehow
the
bible
got
packed
up
in
the
hamper
it
will
be
a
year
since
now
i
was
very
vexed
about
it
at
the
time
the
good
shepherd
found
you
asked
the
child
i
do
know
child
i
do
want
much
finding
i
not
so
bad
as
all
that
i
a
very
decent
woman
i
am
john
thomas
will
tell
you
that
i
suppose
said
rosalie
looking
very
puzzled
must
be
one
of
the
do
you
mean
child
asked
she
mean
one
of
the
sheep
which
do
need
any
repentance
because
they
were
never
lost
and
the
good
shepherd
never
found
them
nor
carried
them
home
nor
said
of
them
rejoice
with
me
for
i
have
found
my
sheep
which
was
lost
jinx
looking
at
rosalie
with
a
face
if
the
old
mother
one
of
the
what
am
i
do
know
said
rosalie
gravely
must
know
better
than
i
do
mr
jinx
how
is
one
to
know
he
answered
i
not
one
of
the
what
am
i
then
you
really
want
to
know
said
the
child
gravely
if
not
we
wo
talk
about
it
please
said
jinx
in
quite
a
different
tone
really
do
want
to
know
about
it
mother
said
one
day
said
rosalie
she
thought
there
were
only
three
kinds
of
sheep
in
the
parable
there
are
the
sheep
who
were
never
lost
and
who
need
no
repentance
because
they
never
done
anything
wrong
or
said
anything
wrong
but
have
always
been
quite
good
and
holy
and
pure
that
kind
my
mother
said
she
thought
the
must
be
the
angels
she
did
think
there
were
any
in
this
world
that
old
mother
said
jinx
must
be
an
angel
you
see
well
little
go
on
then
there
are
the
lost
sheep
said
rosalie
of
sin
and
far
away
from
the
fold
they
do
love
the
good
shepherd
and
sometimes
they
do
even
know
that
they
they
are
very
far
from
the
right
way
very
far
from
being
perfectly
good
and
holy
said
jinx
what
the
kind
of
sheep
that
the
sheep
which
was
lost
but
is
found
again
what
are
they
like
asked
the
lad
love
the
good
shepherd
they
listen
to
his
voice
and
follow
him
and
never
never
want
to
wander
from
the
fold
that
the
kinds
asked
jinx
said
rosalie
all
said
jinx
thoughtfully
made
up
my
mind
which
i
am
mr
jinx
asked
the
child
he
said
see
i
ca
be
one
of
the
because
i
done
lots
of
bad
things
in
my
life
i
got
into
tempers
and
sworn
and
i
done
heaps
of
bad
things
so
out
of
the
question
and
i
ca
be
a
sheep
because
i
do
love
the
good
shepherd
i
never
think
about
him
at
all
so
i
suppose
i
a
sheep
that
a
very
bad
thing
to
be
is
it
very
bad
if
you
are
always
a
lost
sheep
said
the
child
if
you
are
one
of
the
lost
sheep
then
came
to
seek
and
to
he
come
to
seek
and
save
the
old
mother
asked
jinx
if
she
one
of
the
said
rosalie
says
the
son
of
man
is
come
to
seek
and
to
save
that
which
was
so
if
she
is
lost
it
does
mean
her
the
woman
looked
very
uncomfortable
when
rosalie
said
this
she
did
not
like
to
think
that
jesus
had
not
come
to
save
her
and
suppose
a
fellow
knows
he
one
of
the
lost
sheep
said
jinx
has
he
got
to
do
must
cry
out
to
the
good
shepherd
and
tell
him
he
lost
and
ask
the
good
shepherd
to
find
him
but
first
of
all
i
suppose
said
jinx
must
make
himself
a
to
go
to
the
good
shepherd
leave
off
a
few
of
his
bad
ways
and
make
himself
decent
a
bit
no
said
rosalie
never
get
back
to
the
fold
that
way
first
of
all
he
must
tell
the
shepherd
he
lost
and
then
the
shepherd
who
has
been
seeking
him
a
long
long
time
will
find
him
at
once
and
carry
him
on
his
shoulders
home
and
then
the
good
shepherd
will
help
him
to
do
all
the
rest
i
think
about
what
you
said
jinx
replied
you
little
john
thomas
here
pulled
up
saying
it
was
two
and
time
they
had
dinner
so
the
caravans
were
drawn
up
by
the
roadside
and
the
woman
took
the
dinner
from
the
oven
and
jinx
was
sent
to
the
next
caravan
with
lord
fatimore
dinner
and
rosalie
offering
to
help
was
sent
after
him
with
the
same
gentleman
pipe
and
tobacco
she
found
lord
fatimore
sitting
in
state
in
his
own
caravan
he
was
an
immensely
fat
man
or
rather
an
enormously
overgrown
boy
very
swollen
and
imbecile
in
appearance
he
was
lounging
in
an
easy
chair
looking
the
picture
of
indolence
he
brightened
up
a
little
as
he
saw
his
dinner
arriving
it
was
the
great
event
of
his
day
when
rosalie
returned
to
the
caravan
the
woman
was
alone
stroking
skirrywinks
who
was
lying
on
her
knee
but
looking
as
if
her
thoughts
were
far
away
she
said
to
rosalie
not
one
of
the
ninety
i
need
repentance
i
one
of
the
lost
sheep
so
glad
said
rosalie
then
the
good
shepherd
is
seeking
you
wo
you
ask
him
to
find
you
but
before
she
could
answer
john
thomas
and
jinx
came
in

they
all
insisted
on
rosalie
joining
them
after
dinner
john
thomas
sat
in
the
caravan
and
smoked
and
jinx
drove
and
rosalie
sat
still
thinking
but
she
was
so
tired
and
worn
out
that
after
a
little
time
the
picture
on
the
wall
john
thomas
the
woman
skirrywinks
tozer
and
spanco
faded
from
her
sight
and
she
fell
fast
asleep
chapter
xx
mother
manikin
chairs
when
rosalie
awoke
it
was
almost
dark
the
woman
was
lighting
the
little
and
filling
the
kettle
from
a
large
can
of
water
which
stood
in
the
corner
of
the
caravan
are
we
said
the
child
in
a
sleepy
voice
upon
pendleton
little
answered
jinx
up
and
see
the
lights
in
the
distance
dear
and
it
nearly
dark
said
rosalie
mind
my
dear
we
just
there
said
john
thomas
he
did
not
know
that
she
had
five
more
miles
to
walk
so
the
wheels
of
the
caravan
rumbled
on
and
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
came
into
the
streets
of
the
town
it
was
quite
dark
now
and
the
lamps
were
all
lighted
and
the
men
were
going
home
from
work
then
they
arrived
at
the
field
where
the
fair
was
held
the
very
field
where
the
old
man
had
given
rosalie
the
picture
not
many
caravans
had
arrived
for
john
thomas
had
come
in
good
time
and
now
rosalie
must
leave
her
kind
friends
which
she
did
with
many
grateful
thanks
but
before
she
said
goodbye
she
whispered
a
few
words
in
the
woman
ear
to
which
she
made
answer
child
this
very
night
i
will
and
gave
rosalie
a
warm
loving
kiss
on
her
forehead
then
the
little
girl
went
down
the
caravan
steps
and
turned
into
the
neighbouring
street
the
good
shepherd
who
had
helped
her
so
wonderfully
as
far
as
this
would
never
leave
her
now
this
was
her
one
comfort
yet
she
could
not
help
feeling
very
lonely
as
she
went
down
the
street
and
peeped
in
at
the
windows
as
she
passed
by
in
nearly
every
house
a
bright
fire
was
burning
and
tea
was
ready
on
the
table
in
some
a
happy
family
party
was
just
sitting
down
to
their
evening
meal
in
all
there
was
an
air
of
comfort
and
rest
and
rosalie
little
motherless
rosalie
was
out
in
the
cold
muddy
damp
street
alone
out
in
the
darkness
and
the
rain
and
five
miles
from
her
aunt
lucy
house
how
could
she
ever
walk
so
far
that
cold
dark
night
she
trembled
as
she
thought
of
going
alone
down
those
lonely
country
roads
without
a
light
without
a
friend
to
take
care
of
her
and
yet
she
would
be
still
more
afraid
to
wander
about
the
streets
of
this
great
town
where
she
was
sure
there
was
so
much
wickedness
and
sin
even
now
there
were
very
few
people
passing
down
the
street
and
rosalie
began
to
feel
very
much
afraid
of
being
out
alone
she
must
find
some
one
at
once
to
show
her
the
way
to
melton
the
child
was
passing
a
small
neat
row
of
houses
built
close
upon
the
street
most
of
them
were
shut
up
for
the
night
but
through
the
cracks
of
the
shutters
rosalie
could
see
the
bright
light
within
but
the
last
house
in
the
row
was
not
yet
shut
up
and
as
rosalie
came
near
to
it
she
saw
a
childish
figure
come
out
of
the
door
and
go
up
to
the
shutters
to
close
them
the
fasteners
of
the
shutters
had
caught
in
the
hook
on
the
wall
and
the
little
thing
was
too
short
to
unloose
it
she
was
standing
on
tiptoe
trying
to
undo
it
when
rosalie
came
up
me
help
you
she
said
running
up
and
unfastening
the
shutter
extremely
obliged
to
you
said
a
voice
behind
her
which
made
rosalie
start
it
was
no
child
voice
it
was
a
voice
she
knew
well
a
voice
she
had
often
longed
to
hear
it
was
little
mother
manikin
voice
with
one
glad
cry
of
joy
rosalie
flung
herself
into
the
little
arms
mother
manikin
drew
back
at
first
it
was
dark
and
she
could
not
see
rosalie
face
but
when
the
child
said
in
a
tone
of
distress
manikin
dear
mother
manikin
do
you
know
me
i
little
rosalie
joyce
the
dear
little
old
woman
was
full
of
love
and
sympathy
in
a
moment
she
dragged
rosalie
indoors
into
a
warm
little
kitchen
at
the
back
of
the
house
where
the
table
was
spread
for
tea
and
a
kettle
was
singing
cheerily
on
the
fire
and
she
sat
on
a
stool
beside
her
with
both
her
little
hands
grasping
rosalie
now
child
she
said
ever
did
you
find
me
out
did
find
you
out
mother
manikin
said
rosalie
found
me
out
do
you
mean
child
said
the
old
woman
dear
mother
manikin
i
did
know
you
were
here
i
did
know
who
it
was
till
i
had
finished
unfastening
the
shutter
me
child
then
what
makes
you
out
at
this
time
of
night
has
your
caravan
just
arrived
at
the
fair
dear
mother
manikin
i
not
come
to
the
fair
i
quite
alone
and
i
have
five
miles
farther
to
walk
me
all
about
it
child
said
mother
manikin
so
rosalie
told
her
all
told
her
how
and
where
her
mammie
had
died
told
her
about
the
great
and
the
lady
of
the
house
told
her
about
her
father
marriage
and
death
told
her
of
her
aunt
lucy
and
the
letter
and
the
locket
told
her
everything
as
she
would
have
told
her
own
mother
for
mother
manikin
had
a
motherly
heart
and
rosalie
knew
it
and
the
tired
child
felt
a
wonderful
sense
of
comfort
and
rest
in
pouring
out
her
sorrows
into
those
sympathising
ears
but
in
the
middle
of
rosalie
story
the
little
woman
jumped
up
saying
hurriedly
a
minute
child
here
a
strange
kitten
got
in
she
was
just
going
to
drive
out
the
little
black
stranger
which
was
mewing
loudly
under
the
table
when
the
child
stopped
her
dear
mother
manikin
that
my
little
kit
she
has
come
with
me
all
the
way
and
she
very
hungry
that
why
she
makes
such
a
noise
in
another
minute
a
saucer
of
milk
was
placed
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
and
the
poor
little
kitten
had
enough
and
to
spare
rosalie
was
very
grateful
to
mother
manikin
and
very
glad
to
be
with
her
but
just
as
she
was
finishing
her
story
the
large
clock
in
the
corner
of
the
kitchen
struck
seven
and
rosalie
started
to
her
feet
manikin
she
said
must
be
off
i
five
miles
farther
to
walk
and
nonsense

said
the
old
woman

ever
such
a
nice
little
house

said
the
little
woman
you
come
and
look
so
she
took
rosalie
upstairs
and
showed
her
the
neatest
little
bedroom
in
the
front
of
the
house
and
another
room
over
the
kitchen
which
mother
manikin
called
her
greenhouse
for
in
it
arranged
on
boxes
near
the
window
were
all
manner
of
flowerpots
containing
all
manner
of
flowers
ferns
and
mosses
a
nice
sunny
room
my
dear
said
mother
manikin
it
my
hobby

and
old

have
its
liberties
and
these
little
bits
of
plants
are
my
hobby
i
live
here
all
alone
and
they
company
you
see
and
now
come
downstairs
and
see
my
little
parlour
the
parlour
was
in
the
front
of
the
house
and
it
was
the
shutters
of
this
room
which
mother
manikin
was
closing
as
rosalie
came
up
a
bright
lamp
hung
from
the
ceiling
of
the
room
and
white
muslin
curtains
adorned
the
window
but
what
struck
rosalie
most
of
all
was
that
the
parlour
was
full
of
chairs
there
were
rows
and
rows
of
chairs
indeed
the
parlour
was
so
full
of
them
that
mother
manikin
and
rosalie
could
hardly
find
a
place
to
stand
a
number
of
chairs
you
have
here
mother
manikin
said
the
child
in
amazement
the
old
woman
laughed
at
rosalie
astonished
face
child
she
said
you
remember
how
you
talked
to
me
that
night
the
night
when
we
sat
up
in
the
caravan
rosalie
eyes
filled
with
tears
at
the
thought
of
it
dear
mother
manikin
she
answered
you
remember
bow
i
looked
at
your
picture
and
you
told
me
all
about
it
mother
manikin
said
the
child
remember
that
do
you
remember
a
that
you
asked
me
then
rosalie
child
mother
manikin
you
said
has
found
and
i
thought
about
it
a
long
time
and
then
i
told
you
the
truth
i
said
no
child
he
has
found
me
but
if
you
asked
me
that
question
rosalie
child
if
you
asked
little
mother
manikin
do
you
think
the
good
shepherd
has
found
you
mother
manikin
i
should
tell
you
rosalie
child
i
should
tell
you
that
he
went
about
to
seek
and
save
them
which
were
lost
and
that
one
day
when
he
was
seeking
he
found
little
mother
manikin
my
dear
said
the
old
woman
found
me
i
cried
out
to
him
that
i
was
lost
and
wanted
finding
and
he
heard
me
child
he
heard
me
and
he
carried
me
on
his
shoulders
rejoicing
little
rosalie
could
not
help
crying
when
she
heard
this
but
they
were
tears
of
joy
i
gave
up
the
fairs
child
it
did
seem
as
if
i
could
follow
the
good
shepherd
there
there
was
a
lot
of
foolishness
and
nonsense
and
distraction
so
i
left
them
i
told
them
old
age
must
have
its
liberties
and
i
brought
away
my
savings
and
a
little
sum
of
money
i
had
of
my
own
and
i
took
this
little
house
so
that
how
it
is
child
said
the
little
old
woman
about
the
chairs
said
rosalie
about
the
chairs
repeated
the
old
woman
coming
to
that
now
i
was
sitting
one
night
thinking
my
dear
over
the
kitchen
fire
i
was
thinking
about
the
good
shepherd
and
how
he
had
died
for
me
just
that
i
might
be
found
and
brought
back
to
the
fold
and
i
thought
child
when
he
had
been
so
good
to
me
it
was
very
bad
of
me
to
do
nothing
for
him
in
return
nothing
to
show
him
i
grateful
you
see
i
shook
my
fist
and
i
said
to
myself
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
mother
manikin
you
little
idle
ungrateful
old
thing
then
rosalie
child
i
began
to
think
what
can
i
do
i
so
little
you
see
and
folks
laugh
at
me
and
run
after
me
when
i
go
out
and
so
all
things
seemed
closed
upon
me
there
seemed
nothing
for
little
mother
manikin
to
do
for
the
good
shepherd
so
i
knelt
down
child
and
i
asked
him
i
said
good
shepherd
have
you
got
any
work
for
a
woman
that
only
three
feet
high
because
i
do
love
you
and
want
to
do
rosalie
child
it
came
quite
quick
after
that
westerdale
called
and
said
he
mother
manikin
i
want
to
have
a
little
bible
meeting
for
some
of
the
poor
things
round
here
the
mothers
who
have
little
babies
and
ca
get
to
any
place
of
worship
and
a
few
more
who
are
often
ill
and
ca
walk
far
do
you
know
he
said
anybody
in
this
row
who
would
let
me
have
a
room
for
my
class
child
i
danced
for
joy
i
really
did
child
i
danced
like
i
danced
since
i
left
the
royal
show
so
westerdale
he
says
what
the
matter
mother
manikin
he
thought
i
gone
clean
off
my
head
why
westerdale
i
cried
there
something
i
can
do
for
the
good
shepherd
though
i
only
three
feet
high
then
he
understood
child
and
he
finds
the
parlour
very
convenient
and
the
people
come
so
nicely
and
it
a
happy
night
for
me
so
what
the
chairs
are
for
westerdale
will
be
here
in
a
minute
child
he
always
gets
a
cup
of
tea
with
me
before
the
folks
come
that
why
i
so
late
i
always
wait
till
he
comes
she
had
no
sooner
said
the
words
than
a
rap
was
heard
at
the
door
and
the
little
woman
ran
to
open
it
for
westerdale
he
was
an
old
man
with
a
rosy
face
and
a
kind
and
cheerful
voice
mother
manikin
he
said
as
he
came
into
the
kitchen
good
cup
of
tea
ready
for
me
as
usual
what
a
good
kind
woman
you
are
is
a
little
friend
of
mine
westerdale
said
mother
manikin
introducing
rosalie
but
rosalie
needed
no
introduction
she
shook
hands
with
the
old
man
and
then
darted
out
of
the
room
and
in
another
minute
returned
with
her
small
bag
which
she
had
left
upstairs
hastily
unfastening
it
she
took
from
it
her
dear
picture
the
picture
which
had
done
so
much
for
her
and
her
mother
and
little
mother
manikin
and
holding
it
up
before
the
old
man
she
cried
out
sir
it
quite
safe
i
kept
it
all
this
time
and
please
i
do
love
it
so
for
westerdale
was
rosalie
old
friend
who
had
come
to
see
her
in
the
fair
just
a
year
ago
he
did
not
remember
her
but
he
remembered
the
picture
and
when
rosalie
told
him
where
she
had
seen
him
a
recollection
of
the
sick
woman
and
her
pretty
child
came
back
to
his
mind
as
they
sat
over
their
comfortable
little
tea
and
rosalie
told
how
that
picture
had
been
the
messenger
of
mercy
to
her
dying
mother
the
old
man
face
became
brighter
than
ever
and
after
tea
the
people
began
to
arrive
it
was
a
pleasant
sight
to
see
how
little
mother
manikin
welcomed
them
one
by
one
as
they
came
in
they
all
seemed
to
know
her
well
and
to
love
her
and
trust
her
she
had
so
many
questions
to
ask
them
and
they
had
so
much
to
tell
her
there
was
freddy
cough
to
be
inquired
after
and
grandfather
rheumatism
and
the
baby
chickenpox
and
mother
manikin
must
be
told
how
willie
had
got
that
situation
he
was
trying
for
and
how
old
joyce
had
got
a
letter
from
her
daughter
at
last
and
how
price
daughter
had
broken
her
leg
and
price
had
told
them
to
say
how
glad
she
would
be
if
mother
manikin
could
go
in
to
see
her
for
a
few
minutes
sometimes
little
mother
manikin
had
heart
at
leisure
from
itself
to
soothe
and
sympathise
and
their
troubles
were
her
troubles
their
joys
her
joys
at
last
every
one
had
arrived
and
the
chairs
in
the
were
all
filled
then
the
clock
struck
eight
and
they
were
all
quite
still
as
westerdale
gave
out
the
hymn
and
when
the
hymn
and
the
prayer
were
ended
westerdale
began
to
speak
rosalie
was
sitting
close
to
mother
manikin
and
she
listened
very
attentively
to
all
that
her
old
friend
said
your
sins
be
as
scarlet
they
shall
be
as
white
as
snow
that
was
the
text
of
the
sermon
long
way
from
here
my
friends
said
westerdale
long
way
from
here
in
the
land
of
palestine
is
a
beautiful
mountain
the
top
of
which
is
covered
with
the
purest
whitest
snow
one
day
a
very
great
many
years
ago
the
apostle
john
and
two
of
his
friends
were
lying
on
the
mountain
asleep
and
when
they
awoke
they
saw
a
wonderful
sight
they
saw
the
lord
jesus
in
his
glory
and
his
raiment
was
exceeding
white
as
white
as
snow
few
years
later
god
let
this
same
apostle
john
look
into
heaven
and
there
he
saw
everything
the
same
colour
pure
unstained
white
the
lord
jesus
had
his
head
and
his
hair
as
white
as
wool
as
white
as
snow
he
was
sitting
on
a
white
throne
and
all
the
vast
multitude
standing
round
the
throne
had
white
robes
on
pure
spotless
white
as
white
as
snow
my
friends
that
is
not
perfect
white
can
enter
heaven
for
pure
perfect
white
is
heaven
colour
does
all
this
mean
it
means
that
nothing
can
enter
that
holy
heaven
that
is
not
perfectly
pure
perfectly
holy
perfectly
free
from
sin
there
is
another
colour
mentioned
in
my
text
a
colour
which
is
just
the
opposite
to
white
glaring
scarlet
and
this
colour
is
used
as
a
picture
of
that
which
is
not
pure
not
holy
that
upon
which
god
can
not
look
i
mean
sin
sins
are
as
scarlet
god
says
and
no
scarlet
can
enter
heaven
nothing
is
found
within
the
gates
of
heaven
but
pure
white
as
white
as
snow
nothing
short
of
perfect
holiness
can
admit
you
or
me
into
heaven
when
we
stand
before
the
gate
it
will
be
no
good
our
pleading
i
almost
white
i
nearly
white
i
whiter
than
my
neighbours
nothing
but
pure
white
nay
white
as
snow
will
avail
us
anything
one
single
scarlet
spot
is
enough
to
shut
the
gates
of
heaven
against
us
dear
friends
this
is
a
very
solemn
thought
for
who
in
this
room
which
of
you
mothers
which
of
you
young
girls
can
stand
up
and
say
there
is
no
scarlet
spot
on
me
i
am
free
from
sin
heaven
gate
would
be
opened
to
me
for
i
have
never
done
anything
wrong
i
am
quite
white
as
white
as
snow
of
you
can
say
that
which
of
you
would
dare
to
say
it
if
you
stood
before
the
gate
of
heaven
is
no
hope
then
you
say
for
me
heaven
gates
are
for
ever
closed
against
me
i
have
sinned
over
and
over
again
i
am
covered
with
scarlet
spots
nay
i
am
altogether
scarlet
red
like
crimson
deep
as
scarlet
scarlet
of
the
deepest
dye
are
the
manifold
transgressions
which
upon
my
conscience
lie
god
alone
can
count
their
number
god
alone
can
look
within
oh
the
sinfulness
of
sinning
oh
the
guilt
of
every
sin
there
is
no
hope
not
the
least
for
me
only
spotless
white
can
enter
heaven
so
i
must
be
for
ever
shut
out
you
is
there
indeed
no
hope
oh
listen
again
to
the
text
though
your
sins
be
as
scarlet
they
shall
be
as
white
as
snow
there
is
a
way
of
changing
the
scarlet
into
white
there
is
a
way
of
making
the
deep
glaring
scarlet
turn
into
pure
white
as
white
as
snow
what
good
news
for
us
what
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
how
is
it
done
how
can
you
or
i
who
are
so
covered
with
scarlet
stains
of
sin
be
made
as
white
as
snow
friends
is
the
way
there
is
one
the
lord
jesus
christ
who
has
been
punished
instead
of
us
who
has
taken
all
our
sins
upon
him
just
as
if
they
were
his
own
sins
and
has
been
punished
for
them
as
if
he
had
really
done
them
the
great
god
who
loved
us
so
planned
all
this
and
now
he
can
forgive
us
our
sins
for
the
punishment
is
over
he
can
not
only
forgive
but
he
can
forget
he
can
blot
them
out
he
can
make
us
clean
and
white
as
white
as
snow
then
is
his
offer
to
you
come
now
he
cries
only
accept
my
offer
only
take
the
lord
jesus
christ
as
your
saviour
only
ask
him
to
wash
you
in
his
blood
only
see
by
faith
that
he
died
in
your
place
instead
of
you
and
your
sins
your
scarlet
sins
shall
be
made
as
white
as
snow
this
very
night
before
you
lie
down
to
sleep
you
may
be
made
so
white
that
heaven
gate
will
when
you
stand
before
it
be
thrown
wide
open
to
you
so
white
that
you
will
be
fit
to
stand
amongst
that
great
multitude
which
no
man
can
number
who
have
washed
their
robes
and
made
them
white
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
dear
friends
will
you
accept
god
offer
will
you
come
to
the
lord
jesus
to
be
made
white
will
you
plead
this
promise
the
promise
in
my
text
will
you
before
you
lie
down
to
sleep
say
lord
my
sins
are
indeed
as
scarlet
make
them
in
the
blood
of
christ
as
white
as
snow
you
i
ask
you
again

no
chapter
xxi
in
sight
of
home
when
the
little
service
was
over
the
people
went
away
and
westerdale
mother
manikin
and
rosalie
sat
together
over
the
fire
talking
the
old
man
was
much
encouraged
by
all
that
he
heard
from
the
child
he
had
sometimes
wondered
whether
his
visits
to
the
fair
had
done
the
slightest
good
to
any
one
and
now
that
he
heard
how
god
had
so
largely
blessed
this
one
picture
he
felt
strengthened
and
cheered
to
make
further
efforts
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
travellers
whose
souls
so
few
care
for
next
sunday
would
be
the
sunday
for
him
to
visit
the
shows
he
said
and
he
should
go
there
this
year
with
more
hope
and
more
faith
when
rosalie
heard
this
she
begged
him
to
have
a
little
conversation
with
the
woman
with
whom
she
had
travelled
she
told
him
to
look
out
for
the
show
over
the
door
of
which
was
written
fatimore
and
other
pleasing
varieties
for
there
she
felt
sure
he
would
find
a
work
to
do
and
she
did
not
forget
to
ask
him
when
he
went
there
to
remember
to
inquire
for
jinx
and
to
speak
to
him
also
when
westerdale
had
said
and
was
gone
away
mother
manikin
insisted
on
rosalie
going
at
once
to
bed
for
the
child
was
very
weary
with
her
long
and
tiring
day
she
slept
very
soundly
and
in
the
morning
awoke
to
find
mother
manikin
standing
beside
her
with
a
cup
of
tea
in
her
hands
child
she
said
this
before
you
get
up
dear
mother
manikin
said
rosalie
starting
up
how
good
you
are
to
me
you
child
said
the
dear
little
old
woman
only
wish
you
could
stay
with
me
altogether
now
mind
me
child
if
you
find
when
you
get
to
melton
that
it
is
convenient
for
you
to
stay
at
your
aunt
just
you
come
back
to
me
dear
me
how
comfortable
you
and
me
might
be
together
lonesome
at
times
here
and
want
a
bit
of
company
and
my
little
bit
of
money
is
enough
for
both
of
us
so
mind
you
child
repeated
mother
manikin
shaking
her
little
fist
at
rosalie
you
do
find
all
quite
straight
at
melton
if
you
think
it
puts
them
out
at
all
to
take
you
in
you
come
to
me
now
i
said
it
and
when
i
said
it
i
mean
it
old
age
must
have
its
liberties
and
i
must
be
obeyed
mother
manikin
said
rosalie
putting
her
arms
round
the
little
old
woman
neck
can
never
never
never
say
thank
you
often
enough
after
breakfast
rosalie
started
on
her
journey
with
the
little
black
kit
in
its
usual
place
in
her
arms
mother
manikin
insisted
on
wrapping
up
a
little
parcel
containing
lunch
for
the
child
to
eat
on
her
way
and
as
she
stood
on
the
doorstep
to
see
her
off
she
called
out
after
her
child
if
all
is
quite
straight
come
back
here
i
shall
be
looking
out
for
you
so
rosalie
started
on
her
journey
on
her
way
she
passed
the
field
where
the
fair
was
to
be
held
what
recollections
it
brought
to
her
mind
of
the
year
before
when
she
had
arrived
there
in
the
caravan
with
her
sick
mother
not
many
shows
had
reached
the
place
for
it
was
yet
three
days
before
the
fair
would
be
held
but
in
one
corner
of
the
field
rosalie
discovered
the
bright
yellow
caravans
of
the
show
of
fatimore
and
other
pleasing
varieties
she
could
not
pass
by
without
going
for
a
moment
to
the
caravan
to
thank
old
mother
and
john
thomas
and
jinx
for
their
kindness
to
her
the
day
before
mother
was
having
a
great
wash
of
all
john
thomas
clothes
and
lord
fatimore
and
jinx
and
her
own
she
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
caravan
washing
and
jinx
was
busily
engaged
hanging
out
the
clothes
on
a
line
which
had
been
stretched
between
the
two
caravans
young
said
he
as
rosalie
came
up
where
have
you
sprung
from
rosalie
told
him
that
she
had
spent
the
night
with
a
friend
who
lived
in
the
town
and
was
going
to
continue
her
journey
said
jinx
have
forgot
what
you
told
me
about
that
there
picture
i
like
my
picture
a
deal
more
than
i
did
afore
then
rosalie
went
up
to
the
woman
who
did
not
see
her
till
she
was
close
to
the
caravan
steps
the
woman
was
hard
at
work
at
her
washing
with
skirrywinks
sitting
on
her
shoulder
and
spanco
the
pigeon
on
her
head
rosalie
could
not
be
quite
sure
but
she
fancied
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
bent
over
her
washing
it
you
she
said
to
rosalie
am
glad
to
see
you
again
i
was
thinking
about
you
just
then
you
said
the
child
were
you
thinking
was
thinking
over
what
we
talked
about
yesterday
about
the
lost
sheep
you
remember
last
night
to
ask
the
good
shepherd
to
find
you
said
rosalie
yes
said
the
woman
did
forget
but
instead
of
the
good
shepherd
finding
me
i
think
i
farther
away
from
the
fold
than
ever
leastways
i
never
knew
i
was
so
bad
before
the
good
shepherd
is
going
to
find
you
said
rosalie
only
waits
until
we
know
we
are
lost
and
then
he
is
ready
to
find
us
at
once
i
do
hope
so
the
woman
earnestly
think
of
me
sometimes
wo
you
i
never
forget
you
said
the
child
you
come
in
and
rest
a
bit
thank
you
said
rosalie
must
go
now
i
have
some
way
farther
to
walk
but
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
and
to
thank
you
for
being
so
kind
to
me
yesterday
you
said
the
woman
heartily
was
nothing
to
speak
of
child
and
mind
you
think
of
me
sometimes
so
rosalie
left
the
and
turned
on
to
the
melton
road
what
a
strange
feeling
came
over
her
then
she
was
within
five
miles
of
her
aunt
lucy
and
was
really
going
to
her
at
last
oh
how
she
had
longed
to
see
that
dear
face
which
she
had
gazed
at
so
often
in
the
locket
how
she
had
yearned
to
deliver
her
mother
letter
and
to
see
her
aunt
lucy
reading
it
how
often
how
very
often
all
this
had
been
in
her
mind
by
day
and
had
mingled
with
her
dreams
at
night
and
yet
now
now
that
she
was
really
on
the
road
which
led
up
to
her
aunt
lucy
door
rosalie
heart
failed
her
she
looked
down
at
her
little
frock
and
saw
how
very
old
and
faded
it
was
she
took
off
her
hat
and
the
piece
of
black
ribbon
which
toby
had
given
her
had
never
before
seemed
so
rusty
and
brown
what
a
shabby
little
girl
her
aunt
lucy
would
see
coming
in
at
the
her
thoughts
travelled
back
to
the
little
girl
whom
she
had
seen
in
that
garden
a
year
ago
her
aunt
lucy
own
little
girl
how
differently
she
was
dressed
how
different
in
every
way
she
was
to
rosalie
what
if
her
aunt
lucy
was
vexed
with
her
for
coming
she
had
had
much
trouble
from
rosalie
father
was
it
likely
she
would
welcome
his
child
sometimes
rosalie
felt
inclined
to
turn
back
and
go
to
old
mother
manikin
but
she
remembered
how
her
mother
had
said
ever
you
can
dear
you
must
go
to
your
aunt
lucy
and
give
her
that
letter
and
now
whatever
it
cost
her
rosalie
determined
she
would
go
but
she
grew
more
and
more
shy
as
she
drew
nearer
the
village
and
walked
far
more
slowly
than
she
had
done
when
she
first
left
the
town
at
last
the
village
of
melton
came
in
sight
it
was
a
fine
spring
morning
and
the
sunlight
was
falling
softly
on
the
cottages
and
farmhouses
and
the
beautiful
green
trees
and
hedges
rosalie
rested
a
little
on
a
stile
before
she
went
farther
and
the
little
black
kit
basked
in
the
sunshine
the
field
close
by
was
full
of
sheep
and
the
child
sat
and
watched
them
it
was
a
very
pretty
field
there
were
groups
of
trees
under
the
shadow
of
which
the
sheep
could
lie
and
rest
and
there
was
a
quiet
stream
trickling
through
the
midst
of
the
field
where
the
sheep
could
drink
the
cool
refreshing
water
as
rosalie
watched
the
sheep
in
their
happy
quiet
field
a
verse
of
the
psalm
which
popsey
old
grandfather
had
read
came
into
her
mind
maketh
me
to
lie
down
in
green
pastures
he
leadeth
me
beside
the
still
waters
what
if
the
good
shepherd
were
about
to
take
her
his
poor
little
motherless
lamb
to
a
green
pasture
a
quiet
restful
home
where
she
might
be
taught
more
of
the
good
shepherd
love
how
rosalie
prayed
that
it
might
indeed
be
so
and
then
she
summoned
courage
and
went
on
it
was
about
twelve
when
she
reached
melton
the
country
people
were
most
of
them
having
their
dinner
and
few
people
were
in
the
village
street
with
a
beating
heart
the
child
pressed
on
soon
she
came
in
sight
of
the
little
cottage
before
which
the
caravan
had
stood
when
she
and
her
mother
were
there
a
year
ago
there
was
the
cottage
with
its
thatched
roof
looking
just
as
comfortable
as
it
had
done
then
there
was
the
garden
just
the
same
as
before
with
the
same
kind
of
flowers
growing
in
it
there
were
the
the
southernwood
the
rosemary
the
sweetbriar
and
the
lavender
and
the
wind
was
blowing
softly
over
them
and
wafting
their
sweet
fragrance
to
rosalie
just
as
it
had
done
a
year
ago
and
there
was
rosalie
standing
peeping
through
the
gate
just
as
she
had
done
then
it
seemed
to
rosalie
like
a
dream
which
she
had
dreamt
before
only
a
year
only
a
year
ago
and
yet
one
was
absent
her
mother
was
no
more
there
she
was
gone
and
little
rosalie
was
alone
by
the
gate
tears
came
in
her
eyes
as
she
looked
through
the
bars
and
fell
upon
her
little
dusty
frock
but
she
wiped
them
away
and
went
on
through
the
village
street
at
last
she
arrived
at
the
large
house
close
to
the
church
which
her
mother
had
longed
so
much
to
see
with
a
trembling
hand
she
opened
the
iron
gate
and
walked
up
the
broad
gravel
path
there
was
a
large
knocker
in
the
middle
of
the
door
and
a
bell
on
one
side
of
it
rosalie
did
not
know
whether
to
knock
or
to
ring
so
she
stood
still
for
a
few
minutes
without
doing
either
hoping
that
some
one
would
see
her
from
the
window
and
come
to
ask
what
she
wanted
but
as
the
minutes
passed
by
and
no
one
came
rosalie
ventured
very
gently
and
timidly
to
rap
with
the
knocker
but
no
one
inside
the
house
heard
the
sound
of
the
child
knocking
so
she
gathered
courage
and
pulled
the
bell
which
rang
so
loudly
that
it
made
her
tremble
more
than
ever
then
she
heard
a
rustling
in
the
hall
and
the
sound
of
a
quick
footstep
and
the
door
was
opened
a
girl
about
eighteen
years
of
age
stood
before
her
dressed
in
a
pretty
print
dress
and
very
white
apron

with
a

of

rosalie
said
jessie

very

said
rosalie
through
her
tears
you

my

that
i
did
do
you
think
i
would
forget
anything
she
asked
me
why
i
should
never
have
been
here
if
it
had
been
for
her
you
remember
what
you
said
to
leslie
jessie
dear
it
was
the
first
time
she
came
to
our
house
after
i
came
back
i
told
her
all
about
what
i
had
done
and
where
i
had
been
and
then
i
told
her
how
i
had
met
with
a
woman
who
used
to
know
her
many
years
ago
but
who
had
seen
her
for
a
long
long
time
and
that
this
woman
had
sent
her
a
message
so
she
asked
me
who
this
woman
was
and
what
the
message
was
which
she
had
sent
her
i
told
her
that
the
woman
name
was
norah
but
i
know
her
other
name
and
that
norah
sent
her
respects
and
her
love
and
i
was
to
say
that
she
had
not
very
long
to
live
but
that
the
good
shepherd
had
sought
her
and
found
her
and
that
she
was
not
afraid
to
die
and
then
rosalie
she
cried
when
i
told
her
that
and
went
away
but
she
came
again
about
half
an
hour
after
that
and
asked
me
ever
so
many
questions
about
your
mother
and
i
told
her
all
i
could
i
told
her
how
ill
she
was
and
how
she
liked
the
hymn
and
all
about
you
and
how
good
you
were
to
your
mother
and
then
i
told
her
how
beautifully
your
mother
talked
to
me
about
the
good
shepherd
and
how
she
begged
me
to
ask
the
good
shepherd
to
find
me
and
how
i
had
done
as
she
begged
me
and
i
hoped
that
he
was
carrying
me
home
on
his
shoulder
and
i
told
her
dear
how
kind
you
both
were
to
me
and
how
you
gave
me
that
money
and
made
me
promise
to
know
which
road
the
caravan
was
on
and
which
fair
it
was
going
to
she
asked
a
many
questions
about
that
and
wanted
to
know
if
i
could
tell
her
what
town
would
be
the
next
you
would
stop
at
after
the
one
you
were
going
to
when
i
met
you
but
i
could
now
i
must
go
in
dear
and
get
dinner
ready
but
i
tell
my
mistress
as
soon
as
she
comes
so
rosalie
sat
down
in
the
arbour
to
wait
but
she
could
hardly
sit
still
a
minute
she
felt
so
excited
and
restless
only
now
and
again
she
lifted
up
her
heart
in
prayer
to
the
good
shepherd
asking
him
to
make
her
aunt
love
her
and
help
her
chapter
xxii
the
lost
lamb
found
the
time
that
rosalie
waited
in
the
arbour
seemed
very
very
long
to
her
every
minute
was
like
an
hour
and
at
the
least
sound
she
started
from
her
seat
and
looked
down
the
gravel
path
but
it
was
only
a
bird
or
a
falling
leaf
or
some
other
trifling
sound
which
rosalie
anxious
ears
had
exaggerated
but
at
last
when
the
sound
she
had
been
listening
for
so
long
did
really
come
when
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
gravel
path
coming
towards
the
arbour
rosalie
sat
still
until
they
drew
close
for
in
a
moment
all
the
fears
she
had
had
by
the
way
returned
upon
her
they
were
very
quick
and
eager
footsteps
which
rosalie
heard
and
in
another
moment
almost
before
she
knew
that
her
aunt
lucy
had
entered
the
arbour
she
found
herself
locked
in
her
arms
my
little
rosalie
said
she
with
a
glad
cry
i
found
you
at
last
for
jessie
had
told
leslie
that
it
was
norah
child
who
was
waiting
to
speak
to
her
in
the
arbour
rosalie
could
not
speak
for
a
long
time
after
that
she
was
too
full
of
feeling
for
any
words
and
her
aunt
lucy
could
only
say
over
and
over
again
little
rosalie
have
i
found
you
at
last
it
seemed
to
rosalie
more
like
what
the
good
shepherd
said
of
his
lost
sheep
than
anything
she
had
ever
heard
before
you
been
looking
for
me
dear
aunt
lucy
she
said
at
last
darling
indeed
i
have
said
her
aunt
since
jessie
came
back
i
have
been
trying
to
find
out
where
you
were
i
wanted
so
much
to
see
your
mother
but
before
i
arrived
at
the
place
she
was
dead
i
saw
her
grave
rosalie
darling
i
heard
about
her
dying
in
the
fair
and
my
husband
found
out
where
she
was
buried
and
we
went
and
stood
by
her
grave
and
ever
since
then
dear
child
i
have
been
looking
for
you
but
i
had
lost
all
clue
to
you
and
was
almost
giving
it
up
in
despair
but
i
found
you
now
darling
and
i
am
so
very
thankful
then
rosalie
opened
her
bag
and
took
out
the
precious
letter
how
her
aunt
lucy
hand
trembled
as
she
opened
it
it
was
like
getting
a
letter
from
another
world
and
then
she
began
to
read
but
her
eyes
were
so
full
of
tears
that
she
could
hardly
see
the
words
own
darling
sister
am
writing
this
letter
with
the
faint
hope
that
rosalie
may
one
day
give
it
to
you
it
ought
not
to
be
a
faint
hope
because
i
have
turned
it
so
often
into
a
prayer
oh
how
many
times
have
i
thought
of
you
since
last
we
met
how
often
in
my
dreams
you
have
come
to
me
and
spoken
to
me
am
too
ill
and
too
weak
to
write
much
but
i
want
to
tell
you
that
your
many
prayers
for
me
have
been
answered
at
last
the
lost
sheep
has
been
found
and
has
been
carried
back
to
the
fold
i
think
i
am
the
greatest
sinner
that
ever
lived
and
yet
i
believe
my
sins
are
washed
away
in
the
blood
of
jesus
would
write
more
but
am
too
exhausted
but
i
want
to
ask
you
if
it
is
possible
for
you
to
do
so
to
save
my
sweet
rosalie
from
her
mother
fate
she
is
such
a
dear
child
i
know
you
would
love
her
and
i
am
so
very
unhappy
about
leaving
her
amongst
all
these
temptations
know
i
do
not
deserve
any
favour
from
you
and
you
can
not
think
what
pain
it
gives
me
to
think
how
often
you
have
been
asked
for
money
in
my
name
that
has
been
one
of
the
greatest
trials
of
my
unhappy
life
if
you
can
save
my
little
rosalie
oh
dear
sister
i
think
even
in
heaven
i
shall
know
it
and
be
more
glad
i
would
ask
you
to
do
it
not
for
my
sake
for
i
deserve
nothing
but
shame
and
disgrace
but
for
the
sake
of
him
who
has
said
whoso
shall
receive
one
such
little
child
in
my
name
receiveth
me
loving
sister
did
your
dear
mother
write
the
letter
rosalie
aunt
lucy
asked
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
after
she
had
finished
reading
it
rosalie
told
her
that
it
was
written
only
a
few
days
before
her
mother
died
and
then
she
put
her
hand
inside
her
dress
and
brought
out
the
locket
which
she
laid
in
leslie
hand
you
remember
aunt
lucy
she
said
darling
i
do
said
her
aunt
gave
that
to
your
mother
years
ago
before
she
left
home
i
remember
i
saved
up
my
money
a
very
long
time
that
i
might
buy
it
mother
did
love
that
locket
so
much
said
the
child
said
she
had
promised
you
she
would
keep
it
as
long
as
she
lived
and
i
was
to
tell
you
she
had
kept
her
promise
and
had
hidden
it
away
lest
any
one
should
take
it
from
her
i
have
tried
so
hard
to
keep
it
safe
since
she
died
but
we
have
been
in
a
great
big
all
the
winter
and
i
was
so
afraid
it
would
be
found
and
taken
from
me
is
your
father
now
rosalie
asked
her
aunt
anxiously
dead
said
the
child
has
been
dead
more
than
a
week
and
she
told
of
the
accident
and
the
death
in
the
hospital
you
are
my
little
girl
now
rosalie
said
her
aunt
lucy
own
little
girl
and
no
one
can
take
you
from
me
dear
aunt
lucy
may
i
really
stay
rosalie
darling
i
have
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
and
my
only
fear
was
that
your
father
would
not
want
to
part
with
you
but
now
before
we
talk
any
more
you
must
come
in
and
see
your
uncle
he
is
very
anxious
to
see
you
rosalie
felt
rather
afraid
again
when
her
aunt
said
this
but
she
rose
up
to
follow
her
into
the
house
and
then
she
remembered
the
little
kitten
which
she
covered
with
her
shawl
and
which
was
lying
fast
asleep
under
it
in
a
corner
of
the
arbour
aunt
lucy
said
rosalie
timidly
there
a
bird
dear
said
leslie
looking
round
her
do
see
one
not
here
in
the
garden
explained
rosalie
mean
in
your
house
there
no
bird
dear
child
what
made
you
think
there
was
one
i
so
glad
so
very
very
glad
said
rosalie
with
tears
in
her
eyes
may
i
bring
her
who
rosalie
dear
i
do
understand
aunt
lucy
said
the
child
be
angry
i
have
a
little
kit
here
under
my
shawl
she
the
dearest
little
kit
and
we
love
each
other
so
much
and
if
she
had
to
go
away
from
me
i
think
she
would
die
she
loved
me
when
no
one
else
in
the
did
except
betsey
ann
and
if
only
she
may
come
i
never
let
her
go
in
any
of
the
best
rooms
and
i
let
her
be
any
trouble
when
she
had
said
this
she
lifted
up
the
shawl
and
brought
out
the
black
kitten
and
looked
up
beseechingly
into
her
aunt
face
a
dear
little
kitten
said
her
aunt
will
be
pleased
with
it
she
is
so
fond
of
kittens
and
only
the
other
day
i
promised
her
i
would
get
one
bring
her
in
and
she
shall
have
some
milk
a
great
load
was
lifted
off
little
rosalie
heart
when
leslie
said
this
for
it
would
have
been
a
very
great
trial
to
her
to
part
from
her
little
friend
rosalie
uncle
received
her
very
kindly
and
said
with
a
pleasant
smile
that
he
was
glad
the
little
prairie
flower
had
been
found
at
last
and
was
to
blossom
in
his
garden
then
she
went
upstairs
with
her
aunt
lucy
to
get
ready
for
dinner
she
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
a
beautiful
room
as
leslie
bedroom
the
windows
looked
out
over
the
fields
and
trees
to
the
blue
hills
beyond
then
her
aunt
went
to
a
wardrobe
which
stood
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
brought
out
a
parcel
which
she
opened
and
inside
rosalie
saw
a
beautiful
little
black
dress
very
neatly
and
prettily
made
is
a
dress
which
came
home
last
night
for
my
little
may
said
her
aunt
i
think
it
will
fit
you
dear
will
you
try
it
on
aunt
lucy
said
rosalie
a
beautiful
frock
but
wo
may
want
it
may
is
from
home
said
leslie
is
staying
with
your
uncle
gerald
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
to
have
another
made
for
her
before
she
returns
rosalie
hardly
knew
herself
in
the
new
dress
and
felt
very
shy
at
first
but
it
fitted
her
exactly
and
her
aunt
lucy
was
very
much
pleased
indeed
then
leslie
brought
a
black
ribbon
and
tied
the
precious
locket
round
the
little
girl
neck
there
was
no
longer
any
need
to
hide
it
after
this
they
went
downstairs
and
rosalie
had
a
place
given
her
at
dinner
between
her
uncle
and
her
aunt
jessie
looked
very
much
astonished
when
she
was
told
to
put
another
knife
and
fork
and
plate
on
the
table
for
rosalie
but
her
mistress
seeing
her
surprised
face
called
her
into
another
room
and
in
a
few
words
told
her
who
the
little
girl
was
at
the
same
time
begging
her
for
rosalie
sake
not
to
mention
to
any
one
in
the
village
where
and
how
she
had
seen
the
child
before
this
jessie
most
willingly
promised
was
nothing
she
would
not
do
for
sake
she
said
she
would
never
have
been
there
had
it
not
been
for
rosalie
and
her
mother
that
afternoon
the
child
sat
on
a
stool
at
her
aunt
lucy
feet
and
they
had
a
long
talk
which
little
rosalie
enjoyed
more
than
words
can
tell
she
gave
her
aunt
a
little
history
of
her
life
going
back
as
far
as
she
could
remember
oh
how
eagerly
leslie
listened
to
anything
about
her
poor
sister
how
many
questions
she
asked
and
how
many
tears
she
shed
when
rosalie
had
finished
her
aunt
told
her
once
more
how
glad
and
thankful
she
was
to
have
her
there
and
more
especially
as
she
felt
sure
that
her
little
rosalie
loved
the
good
shepherd
and
tried
to
please
him
and
therefore
would
never
never
do
any
harm
to
her
own
little
may
but
would
rather
help
her
forward
in
all
that
was
right
the
child
slipped
her
hand
in
that
of
her
aunt
lucy
when
she
said
this
with
a
very
loving
and
assuring
smile
now
rosalie
dear
you
must
look
upon
me
as
your
mother
said
leslie
must
tell
me
all
your
troubles
and
ask
me
for
anything
you
want
just
as
you
would
have
asked
your
own
dear
mother
aunt
lucy
said
rosalie
gratefully
think
the
pasture
is
very
green
indeed
do
you
mean
my
dear
child
mean
aunt
lucy
i
have
been
very
lonely
and
often
very
miserable
lately
but
the
good
shepherd
has
brought
me
at
last
to
a
very
green
pasture
do
you
think
he
has
but
leslie
could
only
answer
the
little
girl
by
taking
her
in
her
arms
and
kissing
her
that
night
when
rosalie
went
upstairs
to
bed
jessie
came
into
her
room
to
bring
her
some
hot
water
jessie
said
rosalie
are
maggie
and
the
baby
think
you
remembered
about
them
said
jessie
are
quite
well
oh
you
must
see
them
soon
they
were
all
right
when
you
got
home
said
the
child
they
jessie
yes
god
be
thanked
said
jessie
did
deserve
it
oh
how
often
i
thought
of
those
children
when
i
lay
awake
those
miserable
nights
in
the
circus
they
had
cried
themselves
to
sleep
poor
little
things
when
my
mother
came
back
she
found
them
lying
asleep
on
the
floor
she
very
much
frightened
asked
rosalie
that
she
was
said
jessie
with
tears
in
her
eyes
was
so
ill
when
i
came
home
that
i
thought
she
would
die
i
thought
she
would
die
and
that
i
had
killed
her
she
had
hardly
slept
a
wink
since
i
went
away
and
she
was
as
thin
as
a
ghost
i
hardly
should
have
know
her
anywhere
else
what
did
she
say
when
you
came
back
she
was
angry
a
bit
said
jessie
she
cried
so
and
was
so
glad
to
have
me
back
that
it
seemed
almost
worse
to
bear
than
if
she
had
scolded
and
then
quite
quickly
she
began
to
get
better
but
if
i
come
then
i
believe
she
would
have
died
she
quite
well
now
asked
the
child
quite
strong
and
well
again
and
as
bright
as
ever
she
was
so
glad
when
leslie
said
i
might
come
here
and
be
her
housemaid
my
mother
says
it
a
grand
thing
to
lie
down
to
sleep
at
night
feeling
that
her
children
are
all
safe
and
she
can
never
thank
god
enough
for
all
he
has
done
for
me
i
told
her
of
you
and
your
mother
and
she
prays
for
you
every
day
my
mother
does
that
god
may
reward
and
bless
you
the
next
morning
when
rosalie
opened
her
eyes
she
could
not
at
first
remember
where
she
was
she
had
been
dreaming
she
was
in
the
dismal
and
that
betsey
ann
was
touching
her
hand
and
waking
her
for
their
ten
minutes
reading
but
when
she
looked
up
it
was
only
her
little
black
kitten
which
was
feeling
strange
in
its
new
home
and
had
crept
up
to
her
and
was
licking
her
arm
little
kit
said
rosalie
as
she
stroked
it
gently
do
know
where
you
are
the
kitten
purred
contentedly
when
its
little
mistress
comforted
it
and
the
child
was
at
leisure
to
look
round
the
room
it
was
her
cousin
may
little
room
and
her
aunt
lucy
had
said
she
might
sleep
there
until
another
room
just
like
it
was
made
ready
for
her
rosalie
was
lying
in
a
small
and
very
pretty
iron
bedstead
with
white
muslin
hangings
she
peeped
out
of
her
little
nest
into
the
room
beyond
through
the
window
she
could
see
the
fields
and
the
trees
and
the
blue
hills
just
as
she
had
done
from
her
aunt
lucy
windows
the
furniture
of
the
room
was
very
neat
and
pretty
and
rosalie
looked
at
it
with
admiring
eyes
over
the
and
over
the
chest
of
drawers
and
over
the
table
were
hung
beautiful
illuminated
texts
and
rosalie
read
them
one
by
one
as
she
lay
in
bed
there
was
also
a
little
bookcase
full
of
books
and
a
little
wardrobe
for
may
clothes
how
much
rosalie
wondered
what
her
cousin
was
like
and
how
she
wished
the
time
would
arrive
for
her
to
come
home
then
the
little
girl
jumped
out
of
bed
and
went
to
the
window
to
look
out
the
garden
beneath
her
looked
very
lovely
in
the
bright
morning
sunshine
the
roses
and
geraniums
and
jessamine
were
just
in
their
glory
and
underneath
the
trees
she
could
see
patches
of
lovely
ferns
and
mosses
how
she
wished
her
mother
could
have
been
there
to
see
them
also
she
had
always
loved
flowers
so
much
rosalie
dressed
herself
and
went
out
into
the
garden
how
sweet
and
peaceful
everything
seemed
she
went
to
the
gate
that
gate
which
she
had
looked
through
a
year
before
and
gazed
out
into
the
blue
distance
as
she
was
doing
so
she
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
and
three
or
four
caravans
bound
for
pendleton
fair
went
slowly
down
the
road
what
a
rush
of
feeling
came
over
the
child
as
she
looked
at
them
oh
how
kind
the
good
shepherd
had
been
to
her
here
she
was
safe
and
sheltered
in
this
quiet
happy
home
and
she
would
never
never
have
to
go
to
a
fair
or
a
theatre
again
rosalie
looked
up
at
the
blue
sky
above
and
said
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
good
shepherd
i
do
thank
thee
very
much
for
bringing
me
to
the
green
pasture
oh
help
me
to
love
thee
and
please
thee
more
than
ever
amen
chapter
xxiii
the
green
pasture
that
morning
after
breakfast
leslie
took
rosalie
with
her
in
the
pony
carriage
to
pendleton
she
wanted
to
buy
the
furniture
for
the
little
bedroom
rosalie
enjoyed
the
drive
very
much
indeed
and
was
charmed
and
delighted
with
all
the
purchases
which
her
aunt
made
when
they
were
finished
rosalie
said
lucy
do
you
think
we
should
have
time
to
call
for
a
minute
on
old
mother
manikin
she
will
want
so
much
to
hear
whether
i
got
safely
to
melton
leslie
willingly
consented
she
had
felt
very
grateful
to
the
little
old
woman
for
all
her
kindness
to
her
poor
sister
and
her
little
niece
and
she
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
thanking
her
for
it
they
found
mother
manikin
very
poorly
but
very
pleased
indeed
to
see
rosalie
she
had
been
taken
ill
in
the
night
she
said
quite
suddenly
it
was
something
the
matter
with
her
heart
in
the
morning
she
had
asked
one
of
the
neighbours
to
go
for
the
doctor
and
he
had
said
it
was
not
right
for
her
to
be
in
the
house
alone
what
am
i
to
do
said
mother
manikin
the
doctor
says
i
must
have
a
girl
but
i
ca
bear
all
these
creatures
with
their
flounces
and
their
airs
and
their
manners
old
age
must
have
its
liberties
and
i
ca
put
up
with
them
no
i
ca
abide
them
she
said
shaking
her
little
fist
could
tell
me
of
a
girl
could
you
i
ca
give
very
high
wages
but
she
should
have
a
comfortable
home
aunt
lucy
cried
rosalie
springing
from
her
seat
do
you
think
of
betsey
ann
would
she
do
who
betsey
ann
child
inquired
mother
manikin
rosalie
told
betsey
ann
sad
story
how
she
had
been
born
in
a
workhouse
how
she
had
never
had
any
one
to
love
her
but
how
she
had
been
scolded
and
found
fault
with
from
morning
till
night
mother
manikin
could
hardly
keep
from
crying
as
the
story
went
on
shall
come
at
once
said
she
decidedly
as
soon
as
rosalie
had
finished
me
where
she
lives
and
i
get
westerdale
to
write
to
her
at
once
but
she
ca
read
said
rosalie
in
a
very
distressed
voice
her
mistress
would
never
let
her
have
the
letter
what
are
we
to
do
but
when
mother
manikin
heard
where
betsey
ann
lived
she
said
there
would
be
no
difficulty
at
all
about
it
westerdale
knew
the
scripture
reader
there
she
had
often
heard
him
speak
of
him
and
he
would
be
able
to
go
to
the
house
and
make
it
all
right
so
rosalie
felt
very
comforted
about
poor
betsey
ann
rosalie
first
week
in
the
green
pasture
passed
by
very
happily
she
walked
and
read
and
talked
with
her
aunt
lucy
and
went
with
her
to
see
the
poor
people
in
the
village
and
grew
to
love
her
more
day
by
day
and
was
more
and
more
thankful
to
the
good
shepherd
for
the
green
pasture
to
which
he
had
brought
her
and
after
a
week
may
came
home
such
a
bright
little
creature
she
was
rosalie
loved
her
as
soon
as
she
saw
her
but
it
was
no
strange
face
to
rosalie
it
was
a
face
she
had
often
gazed
at
and
often
studied
for
little
may
was
the
image
of
the
girl
in
the
locket
it
might
have
been
her
own
picture
she
was
so
like
what
her
mother
was
at
her
age
may
and
rosalie
were
the
best
friends
at
once
and
from
that
time
had
everything
in
common
they
did
their
lessons
together
they
walked
together
and
they
played
together
and
were
never
known
to
quarrel
or
to
disagree
some
little
time
after
may
return
the
two
children
went
together
in
the
pony
carriage
to
pendleton
they
had
two
important
things
to
do
there
one
was
to
buy
a
present
for
popsey
the
little
girl
with
the
pitcher
of
milk
and
the
other
was
to
call
on
mother
manikin
to
see
if
betsey
ann
had
arrived
the
two
children
had
each
had
a
given
them
by
leslie
and
rosalie
wished
to
spend
hers
in
something
very
nice
for
little
popsey
but
the
difficulty
was
to
choose
what
it
should
be
all
the
way
to
pendleton
may
was
proposing
different
things
a
book
a
a
etc
but
at
the
mention
of
all
these
rosalie
shook
her
head
was
too
small
for
any
of
these
she
said
could
not
read
nor
sew
nor
write
so
then
may
proposed
a
doll
and
rosalie
thought
that
was
a
very
good
idea
palmer
the
old
coachman
was
asked
to
drive
to
a
toyshop
and
then
after
a
long
consultation
and
an
immense
comparison
of
wax
dolls
composition
dolls
china
dolls
rag
dolls
and
wooden
dolls
a
beautiful
china
doll
very
splendidly
dressed
was
chosen
and
laid
aside
for
rosalie
but
as
she
still
had
some
money
left
she
also
chose
a
very
pretty
for
popsey
grandfather
and
a
beautiful
little
for
the
kind
old
grandmother
the
was
a
white
one
and
the
handle
was
formed
by
a
cat
which
was
supposed
to
be
climbing
up
the
side
of
the
jug
and
peeping
into
the
milk
rosalie
was
delighted
with
this
directly
she
saw
it
and
fixed
upon
it
once
for
she
had
not
forgotten
the
little
pitcher
of
milk
and
the
service
it
had
been
to
her
and
she
thought
that
the
cat
on
the
would
remind
popsey
of
the
little
black
kitten
of
which
she
had
been
so
fond
all
these
parcels
were
put
carefully
under
the
seat
in
the
and
then
they
drove
to
mother
manikin
who
should
open
the
door
but
betsey
ann
looking
the
picture
of
happiness
and
dressed
very
neatly
in
a
clean
calico
dress
and
white
cap
and
apron
betsey
ann
slipshod
shoes
and
her
rags
and
tatters
were
things
of
the
past
she
looked
an
entirely
different
girl
bless
you
she
cried
when
she
saw
rosalie
right
glad
to
see
you
again
and
then
she
suddenly
turned
shy
as
she
looked
at
the
two
young
ladies
and
led
the
way
to
the
parlour
where
mother
manikin
was
sitting
the
old
lady
was
full
of
the
praises
of
her
new
maid
and
betsey
ann
smiled
from
ear
to
ear
with
delight
you
happy
betsey
ann
whispered
rosalie
as
may
was
talking
to
mother
manikin
exclaimed
betsey
ann
should
just
think
i
am
i
never
saw
such
a
good
little
thing
as
she
is
why

here
a
whole
week
and
never
had
a
cross
word
i
declare
i
have
did

like
of
that
i
am
so
glad

happy
said
rosalie
he

mean
the
good
shepherd

good
to
me
said
betsey
ann
wait

minute
rosalie
she
said
as
she
saw
that
rosalie
was
preparing
to
go
got
a
letter
for
you

for
me
exclaimed
rosalie

betsey
ann

i
kept
it
in
hope
of
being
able
to
send
it

day
or
other
i
just
happened
to
be
cleaning
the
doorstep
when
the
postman

so
i

i
poked
it
in
my
pocket
i
going
to
let
her
get
it
i
get
it
for
you
if
you
wait
a
minute
when
betsey
ann
came
downstairs
she
put
the
letter
in
rosalie
hand
it
was
very
bad
and
irregular
writing
and
rosalie
could
not
in
the
least
imagine
from
whom
it
had
come
the
letter
began
thus
dear
miss
hope
this
finds
you
well
as
it
leaves
me
at
present
but
not
so
poor
toby
who
once
you
knew
leastways
i
hope
he
is
well
because
he
is
in
a
better
place
than
this
but
he
has
been
very
badly
off
a
long
while
and
last
saturday
he
died
he
told
me
where
you
lived
he
said
you
was
his
master
daughter
and
it
was
you
as
taught
him
about
the
good
shepherd
told
him
as
i
was
one
of
his
mates
i
would
write
and
tell
you
he
died
quite
happy
knowing
that
his
sins
was
forgiven
was
a
good
lad
was
toby
we
was
a
very
bad
lot
when
he
came
to
our
concern
but
he
read
to
us
spelling
out
the
words
quite
slow
like
every
evening
and
there
a
many
of
us
that
is
like
new
men
since
we
heard
him
was
one
piece
he
read
quite
beautiful
and
never
so
much
as
spelt
a
word
it
was
about
the
shepherd
looking
for
a
sheep
and
bringing
it
home
on
his
shoulder
he
would
talk
to
us
about
that
as
good
as
a
book
and
tell
of
a
picture
he
had
seen
in
your
caravan
and
what
you
used
to
teach
him
about
it
just
before
he
died
says
he
tom
write
and
tell
miss
rosie
be
glad
like
to
hear
i
did
forget
it
all
now
i
wrote
and
pardon
my
mistakes
and
the
liberty
yours
truly
carter
rosalie
was
very
thankful
to
receive
this
letter
she
had
often
wondered
what
had
become
of
poor
toby
and
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
her
to
know
that
he
had
not
forgotten
the
lessons
they
had
learned
together
in
the
caravan
it
was
very
pleasant
to
be
able
to
think
of
him
not
in
the
theatre
or
a
but
in
the
home
above
where
her
own
dear
mother
was
rosalie
did
not
grow
tired
of
her
green
pasture
nor
did
she
wish
to
wander
into
the
wide
world
beyond
as
she
grew
older
and
saw
from
what
she
had
been
saved
she
became
more
and
more
thankful
she
was
not
easily
deceived
by
the
world
glitter
and
glare
and
vain
show
for
rosalie
had
been
behind
the
scenes
and
knew
how
empty
and
hollow
and
miserable
everything
worldly
was
she
had
learned
lessons
behind
the
scenes
that
she
would
not
easily
forget
she
had
learned
that
we
must
not
trust
to
outward
appearances
she
had
learned
that
aching
hearts
are
often
hidden
behind
the
world
smiling
faces
she
had
learned
that
there
is
no
real
no
true
no
lasting
joy
in
anything
of
this
world
she
had
learned
that
whosoever
drinketh
of
such
water
the
water
of
this
world
pleasures
and
amusements
shall
thirst
again
but
she
had
also
learned
that
whosoever
drinketh
of
the
water
which
the
lord
jesus
christ
gives
even
his
holy
spirit
shall
never
thirst
but
shall
be
perfectly
happy
