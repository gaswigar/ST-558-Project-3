preface
i
of
mary
wollstonecraft
ancestors
little
is
known
except
that
they
were
of
irish
descent
her
father
edward
john
wollstonecraft
was
the
son
of
a
prosperous
spitalfields
manufacturer
of
irish
birth
from
whom
he
inherited
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
pounds
he
married
towards
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
elizabeth
dixon
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
in
good
position
of
ballyshannon
by
whom
he
had
six
children
edward
mary
everina
eliza
james
and
charles
mary
the
eldest
daughter
and
second
child
was
born
on
april
the
birth
year
of
burns
and
schiller
and
the
last
year
of
george
ii
reign
she
passed
her
childhood
until
she
was
five
years
old
in
the
neighbourhood
of
epping
forest
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
she
was
born
there
or
at
hoxton
wollstonecraft
followed
no
profession
in
particular
although
from
time
to
time
he
dabbled
in
a
variety
of
pursuits
when
seized
with
a
desire
to
make
money
he
is
described
as
of
idle
dissipated
habits
and
possessed
of
an
ungovernable
temper
and
a
restless
spirit
that
urged
him
to
perpetual
changes
of
residence
from
hoxton
where
he
squandered
most
of
his
fortune
he
wandered
to
essex
and
then
among
other
places
in
to
beverley
in
yorkshire
later
he
took
up
farming
at
laugharne
in
pembrokeshire
but
he
at
length
grew
tired
of
this
experiment
and
returned
once
more
to
london
as
his
fortunes
declined
his
brutality
and
selfishness
increased
and
mary
was
frequently
compelled
to
defend
her
mother
from
his
acts
of
personal
violence
sometimes
by
thrusting
herself
bodily
between
him
and
his
victim
wollstonecraft
herself
was
far
from
being
an
amiable
woman
a
petty
tyrant
and
a
stern
but
incompetent
ruler
of
her
household
she
treated
mary
as
the
scapegoat
of
the
family
mary
early
years
therefore
were
far
from
being
happy
what
little
schooling
she
had
was
spasmodic
owing
to
her
father
migratory
habits
in
her
sixteenth
year
when
the
wollstonecrafts
were
once
more
in
london
mary
formed
a
friendship
with
fanny
blood
a
young
girl
about
her
own
age
which
was
destined
to
be
one
of
the
happiest
events
of
her
life
there
was
a
strong
bond
of
sympathy
between
the
two
friends
for
fanny
contrived
by
her
work
as
an
artist
to
be
the
chief
support
of
her
family
as
her
father
like
wollstonecraft
was
a
lazy
drunken
fellow
mary
new
friend
was
an
intellectual
and
cultured
girl
she
loved
music
sang
agreeably
was
too
for
her
age
and
wrote
interesting
letters
it
was
by
comparing
fanny
blood
letters
with
her
own
that
mary
first
recognised
how
defective
her
education
had
been
she
applied
herself
therefore
to
the
task
of
increasing
her
slender
stock
of
knowledge
hoping
ultimately
to
become
a
governess
at
length
at
the
age
of
nineteen
mary
went
to
bath
as
companion
to
a
tiresome
and
exacting
old
lady
a
dawson
the
widow
of
a
wealthy
london
tradesman
in
spite
of
many
difficulties
she
managed
to
retain
her
situation
for
some
two
years
leaving
it
only
to
attend
the
deathbed
of
her
mother
wollstonecraft
death
in
was
followed
by
the
of
the
home
mary
went
to
live
temporarily
with
the
bloods
at
walham
green
and
assisted
mrs
blood
who
took
in
everina
became
for
a
short
time
housekeeper
to
her
brother
edward
a
solicitor
and
eliza
married
a
bishop
kegan
paul
has
pointed
out
that
all
the
wollstonecraft
sisters
were
enthusiastic
excitable
and
hasty
tempered
apt
to
exaggerate
trifles
sensitive
to
magnify
inattention
into
slights
and
slights
into
studied
insults
all
had
bad
health
of
a
kind
which
is
especially
trying
to
the
nerves
and
eliza
had
in
excess
the
family
temperament
and
constitution
bishop
married
life
from
the
first
was
one
of
utter
misery
they
were
an
pair
and
her
peculiar
temperament
evidently
exasperated
her
husband
worst
nature
his
outbursts
of
fury
and
the
scenes
of
violence
of
daily
occurrence
for
which
he
was
responsible
were
afterwards
described
with
realistic
fidelity
by
mary
in
her
novel
the
wrongs
of
women
it
was
plainly
impossible
for
bishop
to
continue
to
live
with
such
a
man
and
when
in
she
became
dangerously
ill
mary
with
her
characteristic
good
nature
went
to
nurse
her
and
soon
after
assisted
her
in
her
flight
from
her
husband
in
the
following
year
mary
set
up
a
school
at
islington
with
fanny
blood
and
she
was
thus
in
a
position
to
offer
a
home
to
her
sisters
bishop
and
everina
the
school
was
afterwards
moved
to
newington
green
where
mary
soon
had
an
establishment
with
some
twenty
day
scholars
after
a
time
emboldened
by
her
success
she
took
a
larger
house
but
unfortunately
the
number
of
her
pupils
did
not
increase
in
proportion
to
her
obligations
which
were
now
heavier
than
she
could
well
meet
while
mary
was
living
at
newington
green
she
was
introduced
to
johnson
who
godwin
says
treated
her
with
particular
kindness
and
attention
and
with
whom
she
had
a
long
conversation
he
desired
her
to
repeat
her
visit
but
she
was
prevented
from
seeing
him
again
by
his
last
illness
and
death
in
the
meantime
fanny
blood
had
impaired
her
health
by
overwork
and
signs
of
consumption
were
already
evident
a
hugh
skeys
who
was
engaged
in
business
at
lisbon
though
somewhat
of
a
weak
lover
had
long
admired
fanny
and
wanted
to
marry
her
it
was
thought
that
the
climate
of
portugal
might
help
to
restore
her
health
and
she
consented
perhaps
more
on
that
account
than
on
any
other
to
become
his
wife
she
left
england
in
february
but
her
health
continued
to
grow
worse
mary
anxiety
for
her
friend
welfare
was
such
that
on
hearing
of
her
grave
condition
she
at
once
went
off
to
lisbon
and
arrived
after
a
stormy
passage
only
in
time
to
comfort
fanny
in
her
dying
moments
mary
was
almost
at
the
loss
of
her
friend
and
she
made
her
stay
in
lisbon
as
short
as
possible
remaining
only
as
long
as
was
necessary
for
skeys
funeral
she
returned
to
england
to
find
that
the
school
had
greatly
suffered
by
neglect
during
her
absence
in
a
letter
to
skeys
brother
george
blood
she
says
the
loss
of
fanny
was
sufficient
to
have
thrown
a
cloud
over
my
brightest
days
what
effect
then
must
it
have
when
i
am
bereft
of
every
other
comfort
i
have
too
many
debts
the
rent
is
so
enormous
and
where
to
go
without
money
or
friends
who
can
point
out
she
thus
realised
that
to
continue
her
school
was
useless
but
her
experience
as
a
schoolmistress
was
to
bear
fruit
in
the
future
she
had
observed
some
of
the
defects
of
the
educational
methods
of
her
time
and
her
earliest
published
effort
was
a
pamphlet
entitled
thoughts
on
the
education
of
daughters
for
this
essay
she
received
ten
guineas
a
sum
that
she
gave
to
the
parents
of
her
friend
and
mrs
blood
who
were
desirous
of
going
over
to
ireland
she
soon
went
to
ireland
herself
for
in
the
october
of
she
became
governess
to
the
daughters
of
lord
kingsborough
at
michaelstown
with
a
salary
of
forty
pounds
a
year
lady
kingsborough
in
mary
opinion
was
a
shrewd
clever
woman
a
great
talker
she
rouges
and
in
short
is
a
fine
lady
without
fancy
or
sensibility
i
am
almost
tormented
to
death
by
dogs
lady
kingsborough
was
rather
selfish
and
uncultured
and
her
chief
object
was
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
she
pampered
her
dogs
much
to
the
disgust
of
mary
wollstonecraft
and
neglected
her
children
what
views
she
had
on
education
were
narrow
she
had
been
accustomed
to
submission
from
her
governess
but
she
learnt
before
long
that
mary
was
not
of
a
tractable
disposition
the
children
at
first
unruly
and
defiant
literally
speaking
wild
irish
unformed
and
not
very
pleasing
soon
gave
mary
their
confidence
and
before
long
their
affection
one
of
her
pupils
margaret
king
afterwards
lady
mountcashel
always
retained
the
warmest
regard
for
mary
wollstonecraft
lady
mountcashel
continued
her
acquaintance
with
william
godwin
after
mary
death
and
later
came
across
shelley
and
his
wife
in
italy
mary
won
from
the
children
the
affection
that
they
withheld
from
their
mother
consequently
in
the
autumn
of
when
she
had
been
with
lady
kingsborough
for
about
a
year
she
received
her
dismissal
she
had
completed
by
this
time
the
novel
to
which
she
gave
the
name
of
mary
which
is
a
tribute
to
the
memory
of
her
friend
fanny
blood
ii
and
now
in
her
thirtieth
year
mary
wollstonecraft
had
concluded
her
career
as
a
governess
and
was
resolved
henceforth
to
devote
herself
to
literature
her
chances
of
success
were
slender
indeed
for
she
had
written
nothing
to
encourage
her
for
such
a
venture
it
was
her
fortune
however
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
joseph
johnson
the
humanitarian
publisher
and
bookseller
of
paul
churchyard
who
issued
the
works
of
priestley
horne
tooke
gilbert
wakefield
and
other
men
of
advanced
thought
and
she
met
at
his
table
many
of
the
authors
for
whom
he
published
and
such
eminent
men
of
the
day
as
william
blake
fuseli
and
tom
paine
johnson
who
afterwards
proved
one
of
her
best
friends
encouraged
her
in
her
literary
plans
he
was
the
publisher
of
her
thoughts
on
the
education
of
daughters
and
had
recognised
in
that
little
book
so
much
promise
that
when
she
sought
his
advice
he
at
once
offered
to
assist
her
with
employment
mary
therefore
settled
at
michaelmas
in
a
house
in
george
street
blackfriars
she
had
brought
to
london
the
manuscript
of
her
novel
mary
and
she
set
to
work
on
a
book
for
children
entitled
original
stories
from
real
life
both
of
these
books
appeared
before
the
year
was
out
the
latter
with
quaint
plates
by
william
blake
mary
also
occupied
some
of
her
time
with
translations
from
the
french
german
and
even
dutch
one
of
which
was
an
abridged
edition
of
saltzmann
elements
of
morality
for
which
blake
also
supplied
the
illustrations
besides
this
work
johnson
engaged
mary
as
his
literary
adviser
or
reader
and
secured
her
services
in
connexion
with
analytical
a
periodical
that
he
had
recently
founded
while
she
was
at
george
street
she
also
wrote
her
vindication
of
the
rights
of
man
in
a
letter
to
edmund
burke
her
chief
satisfaction
in
keeping
up
this
house
was
to
have
a
home
where
her
brothers
and
sisters
could
always
come
when
out
of
employment
she
was
never
weary
of
assisting
them
either
with
money
or
by
exerting
her
influence
to
find
them
situations
one
of
her
first
acts
when
she
settled
in
london
was
to
send
everina
wollstonecraft
to
paris
to
improve
her
french
accent
johnson
who
wrote
a
short
account
of
mary
life
in
london
at
this
time
says
she
often
spent
her
afternoons
and
evenings
at
his
house
and
used
to
seek
his
advice
or
unburden
her
troubles
to
him
among
the
many
duties
she
imposed
on
herself
was
the
charge
of
her
father
affairs
which
must
indeed
have
been
a
profitless
undertaking
the
most
important
of
mary
wollstonecraft
labours
while
she
was
living
at
blackfriars
was
the
writing
of
the
book
that
is
chiefly
associated
with
her
name
a
vindication
of
the
rights
of
woman
this
volume
now
much
better
known
by
its
title
than
its
contents
was
dedicated
to
the
astute
talleyrand
de
périgord
late
bishop
of
autun
apparently
on
account
of
his
authorship
of
a
pamphlet
on
national
education
it
is
unnecessary
to
attempt
an
analysis
of
this
strikingly
original
but
most
unequal
book
modern
reprints
of
the
work
have
appeared
under
the
editorship
both
of
fawcett
and
pennell
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
it
is
really
a
plea
for
a
more
enlightened
system
of
education
affecting
not
only
her
own
sex
but
also
humanity
in
its
widest
sense
many
of
her
suggestions
have
long
since
been
put
to
practical
use
such
as
that
of
a
system
of
free
national
education
with
equal
advantages
for
boys
and
girls
the
book
contains
too
much
theory
and
is
therefore
to
a
great
extent
obsolete
mary
wollstonecraft
protests
against
the
custom
that
recognises
woman
as
the
plaything
of
man
she
pleads
rather
for
a
friendly
footing
of
equality
between
the
sexes
besides
claiming
a
new
order
of
things
for
women
in
terms
which
are
unusually
frank
such
a
book
could
not
fail
to
create
a
sensation
and
it
speedily
made
her
notorious
not
only
in
this
country
but
on
the
continent
where
it
was
translated
into
french
it
was
of
course
the
outcome
of
the
french
revolution
the
whole
work
is
permeated
with
the
ideas
and
ideals
of
that
movement
but
whereas
the
french
patriots
demanded
rights
for
men
she
made
the
same
demands
also
for
women
it
is
evident
that
the
great
historical
drama
then
being
enacted
in
france
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
mary
mind
its
influence
is
stamped
on
every
page
of
her
book
and
it
was
her
desire
to
visit
france
with
johnson
and
fuseli
her
friends
were
however
unable
to
accompany
her
so
she
went
alone
in
the
december
of
chiefly
with
the
object
of
perfecting
her
french
godwin
states
though
apparently
in
error
that
fuseli
was
the
cause
of
her
going
to
france
the
acquaintance
with
the
painter
having
grown
into
something
warmer
than
mere
friendship
fuseli
however
had
a
wife
and
was
happily
married
so
mary
prudently
resolved
to
retire
into
another
country
far
remote
from
the
object
who
had
unintentionally
excited
the
tender
passion
in
her
breast
she
certainly
arrived
in
paris
at
a
dramatic
moment
she
wrote
on
december
to
her
sister
everina
the
day
after
i
expect
to
see
the
king
at
the
bar
and
the
consequences
that
will
follow
i
am
almost
afraid
to
anticipate
on
the
day
in
question
the
louis
xvi
appeared
in
the
hall
of
the
convention
to
plead
his
cause
through
his
advocate
desize
and
on
the
same
day
she
wrote
that
letter
to
johnson
which
has
so
often
been
quoted
about
nine
this
morning
she
says
the
king
passed
by
my
window
moving
silently
along
excepting
now
and
then
a
few
strokes
on
the
drum
which
rendered
the
stillness
more
awful
through
empty
streets
surrounded
by
the
national
guards
who
clustering
round
the
carriage
seemed
to
deserve
their
name
the
inhabitants
flocked
to
their
windows
but
the
casements
were
all
shut
not
a
voice
was
heard
nor
did
i
see
anything
like
an
insulting
gesture
for
the
first
time
since
i
entered
france
i
bowed
to
the
majesty
of
the
people
and
respected
the
propriety
of
behaviour
so
perfectly
in
unison
with
my
own
feelings
i
can
scarcely
tell
you
why
but
an
association
of
ideas
made
the
tears
flow
insensibly
from
my
eyes
when
i
saw
louis
sitting
with
more
dignity
than
i
expected
from
his
character
in
a
hackney
coach
going
to
meet
death
where
so
many
of
his
race
had
triumphed
my
fancy
instantly
brought
louis
xiv
before
me
entering
the
capital
with
all
his
pomp
after
one
of
his
victories
so
flattering
to
his
pride
only
to
see
the
sunshine
of
prosperity
overshadowed
by
the
sublime
gloom
of
misery
mary
first
went
to
stay
at
the
house
of
madame
filiettaz
the
daughter
of
madame
bregantz
in
whose
school
at
putney
both
bishop
and
everina
wollstonecraft
had
been
teachers
mary
was
now
something
of
a
celebrity
authorship
she
writes
is
a
heavy
weight
for
female
shoulders
especially
in
the
sunshine
of
prosperity
and
she
carried
with
her
letters
of
introduction
to
several
influential
people
in
paris
she
renewed
her
acquaintance
with
tom
paine
became
intimate
with
helen
maria
williams
who
is
said
to
have
once
lived
with
imlay
and
visited
among
others
the
house
of
thomas
christie
it
was
her
intention
to
go
to
switzerland
but
there
was
some
trouble
about
her
passport
so
she
settled
at
neuilly
then
a
village
three
miles
from
paris
her
habitation
here
says
godwin
was
a
solitary
house
in
the
midst
of
a
garden
with
no
other
habitant
than
herself
and
the
gardener
an
old
man
who
performed
for
her
many
offices
of
a
domestic
and
would
sometimes
contend
for
the
honour
of
making
her
bed
the
gardener
had
a
great
veneration
for
his
guest
and
would
set
before
her
when
alone
some
grapes
of
a
particularly
fine
sort
which
she
could
not
without
the
greatest
difficulty
obtain
of
him
when
she
had
any
person
with
her
as
a
visitor
here
it
was
that
she
conceived
and
for
the
most
part
executed
her
historical
and
moral
view
of
the
french
revolution
into
which
she
incorporated
most
of
the
observations
she
had
collected
for
her
letters
and
which
was
written
with
more
sobriety
and
cheerfulness
than
the
tone
in
which
they
had
been
commenced
in
the
evening
she
was
accustomed
to
refresh
herself
by
a
walk
in
a
neighbouring
wood
from
which
her
host
in
vain
endeavoured
to
dissuade
her
by
recounting
divers
horrible
robberies
and
murders
that
had
been
committed
there
illustration
from
an
engraving
by
ridley
dated
after
a
painting
by
john
opie
mary
wollstonecraft
this
picture
was
purchased
for
the
national
gallery
at
the
sale
of
the
late
william
russell
the
reason
for
supposing
that
it
represents
mary
wollstonecraft
rests
solely
on
testimony
of
the
engraving
in
the
published
during
her
lifetime
from
which
this
reproduction
was
made
merritt
made
an
etching
of
the
picture
for
kegan
edition
of
the
letters
to
imlay
face
it
is
probable
that
in
march
mary
wollstonecraft
first
saw
gilbert
imlay
the
meeting
occurred
at
christie
house
and
her
immediate
impression
was
one
of
dislike
so
that
on
subsequent
occasions
she
avoided
him
however
her
regard
for
him
rapidly
changed
into
friendship
and
later
into
love
gilbert
imlay
was
born
in
new
jersey
about
he
served
as
a
captain
in
the
american
army
during
the
revolutionary
war
and
was
the
author
of
a
topographical
description
of
the
western
territory
of
north
america
and
a
novel
entitled
the
emigrants
in
the
latter
work
as
an
american
he
proposes
to
place
a
mirror
to
the
view
of
englishmen
that
they
may
behold
the
decay
of
these
features
that
were
once
so
lovely
and
further
to
prevent
the
sacrilege
which
the
present
practice
of
matrimonial
engagements
necessarily
produce
it
is
not
known
whether
these
views
regarding
marriage
preceded
or
were
the
result
of
his
connexion
with
mary
wollstonecraft
in
he
was
engaged
in
business
probably
in
the
timber
trade
with
sweden
and
norway
in
deciding
to
devote
herself
to
imlay
mary
sought
no
advice
and
took
no
one
into
her
confidence
she
was
evidently
deeply
in
love
with
him
and
felt
that
their
mutual
confidence
shared
by
no
one
else
gave
a
sacredness
to
their
union
godwin
who
is
our
chief
authority
on
the
imlay
episode
states
that
the
origin
of
the
connexion
was
about
the
middle
of
april
and
it
was
carried
on
in
a
private
manner
for
about
three
months
imlay
had
no
property
whatever
and
mary
had
objected
to
marry
him
because
she
would
not
burden
him
with
her
own
debts
or
involve
him
in
certain
family
embarrassments
for
which
she
believed
herself
responsible
she
looked
upon
her
connexion
with
imlay
however
as
of
the
most
inviolable
nature
then
the
french
government
passed
a
decree
that
all
british
subjects
resident
in
france
should
go
to
prison
until
a
general
declaration
of
peace
it
therefore
became
expedient
not
that
a
marriage
should
take
place
for
that
would
necessitate
mary
declaring
her
nationality
but
that
she
should
take
the
name
of
imlay
which
says
godwin
from
the
nature
of
their
connexion
formed
on
her
part
at
least
with
no
capricious
or
fickle
design
she
conceived
herself
entitled
to
do
and
obtain
a
certificate
from
the
american
ambassador
as
the
wife
of
a
native
of
that
country
their
engagement
being
thus
avowed
they
thought
proper
to
reside
under
the
same
roof
and
for
that
purpose
removed
to
paris
in
a
letter
from
mary
wollstonecraft
to
her
sister
everina
dated
from
havre
march
she
describes
the
climate
of
france
as
uncommonly
fine
and
praises
the
common
people
for
their
manners
but
she
is
also
saddened
by
the
scenes
that
she
had
witnessed
and
adds
that
death
and
misery
in
every
shape
of
terror
haunt
this
devoted
country
if
any
of
the
many
letters
i
have
written
have
come
to
your
hands
or
eliza
you
know
that
i
am
safe
through
the
protection
of
an
american
a
most
worthy
man
who
joins
to
uncommon
tenderness
of
heart
and
quickness
of
feeling
a
soundness
of
understanding
and
reasonableness
of
temper
rarely
to
be
met
with
having
been
brought
up
in
the
interior
parts
of
america
he
is
a
most
natural
unaffected
creature
mary
has
expressed
in
the
rights
of
woman
her
ideal
of
the
relations
between
man
and
wife
she
now
looked
forward
to
such
a
life
of
domestic
happiness
as
she
had
cherished
for
some
time
she
had
known
much
unhappiness
in
the
past
godwin
says
she
brought
in
the
present
instance
a
wounded
and
sick
heart
to
take
refuge
in
the
attachment
of
a
chosen
friend
let
it
not
however
be
imagined
that
she
brought
a
heart
querulous
and
ruined
in
its
taste
for
pleasure
no
her
whole
character
seemed
to
change
with
a
change
of
fortune
her
sorrows
the
depression
of
her
spirits
were
forgotten
and
she
assumed
all
the
simplicity
and
the
vivacity
of
a
youthful
mind
she
was
playful
full
of
confidence
kindness
and
sympathy
her
eyes
assumed
new
lustre
and
her
cheeks
new
colour
and
smoothness
her
voice
became
cheerful
her
temper
overflowing
with
universal
kindness
and
that
smile
of
bewitching
tenderness
from
day
to
day
illuminated
her
countenance
which
all
who
knew
her
will
so
well
recollect
and
which
won
both
heart
and
soul
the
affections
of
almost
every
one
that
beheld
it
she
had
now
met
the
man
to
whom
she
earnestly
believed
she
could
surrender
herself
with
entire
devotion
naturally
of
an
affectionate
nature
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
with
her
impulsive
irish
spirit
as
godwin
says
she
gave
way
to
all
the
sensibilities
of
her
nature
the
affair
was
nevertheless
doomed
to
failure
from
the
first
mary
had
taken
her
step
without
much
forethought
she
attributed
to
imlay
uncommon
tenderness
of
heart
but
she
did
not
detect
his
instability
of
character
he
certainly
fascinated
her
as
he
fascinated
other
women
both
before
and
after
his
attachment
to
mary
he
was
not
the
man
to
be
satisfied
with
one
woman
as
his
a
typical
american
he
was
deeply
immersed
in
business
but
his
affairs
may
not
have
claimed
as
much
of
his
time
as
he
represented
in
the
september
after
he
set
up
house
with
mary
that
is
in
the
year
of
the
terror
he
left
her
in
paris
while
he
went
to
havre
formerly
known
as
havre
de
grace
but
then
altered
to
havre
marat
it
is
awful
to
think
what
must
have
been
the
life
of
this
lonely
stranger
in
paris
at
such
a
time
yet
her
letters
to
imlay
contain
hardly
a
reference
to
the
events
of
the
revolution
mary
tired
of
waiting
for
imlay
return
to
paris
and
sickened
with
the
growing
cruelties
of
robespierre
joined
him
at
havre
in
january
and
on
may
she
gave
birth
to
a
girl
whom
she
named
frances
in
memory
of
fanny
blood
the
friend
of
her
youth
there
is
every
evidence
throughout
her
letters
to
imlay
of
how
tenderly
she
loved
the
little
one
in
a
letter
to
everina
dated
from
paris
on
september
she
speaks
thus
of
little
fanny
i
want
you
to
see
my
little
girl
who
is
more
like
a
boy
she
is
ready
to
fly
away
with
spirits
and
has
eloquent
health
in
her
cheeks
and
eyes
she
does
not
promise
to
be
a
beauty
but
appears
wonderfully
intelligent
and
though
i
am
sure
she
has
her
father
quick
temper
and
feelings
her
good
humour
runs
away
with
all
the
credit
of
my
good
nursing
in
september
imlay
left
havre
for
london
and
now
that
the
terror
had
subsided
mary
returned
to
paris
this
separation
really
meant
the
end
of
their
camaraderie
they
were
to
meet
again
but
never
on
the
old
footing
the
journey
proved
the
most
fatiguing
that
she
ever
made
the
carriage
in
which
she
travelled
breaking
down
four
times
between
havre
and
paris
imlay
promised
to
come
to
paris
in
the
course
of
two
months
and
she
expected
him
till
the
end
of
the
year
with
cheerfulness
with
the
press
of
business
and
other
distractions
his
feelings
for
her
and
the
child
had
cooled
as
the
tone
of
his
letters
betrayed
for
three
months
longer
imlay
put
her
off
with
unsatisfactory
explanations
but
her
suspense
came
to
an
end
in
april
when
she
went
to
london
at
his
request
her
gravest
forebodings
proved
too
true
imlay
was
already
living
with
a
young
actress
belonging
to
a
company
of
strolling
players
and
it
was
evident
though
at
first
he
protested
to
the
contrary
that
mary
was
only
a
second
consideration
in
his
life
he
provided
her
however
with
a
furnished
house
and
she
did
not
at
once
abandon
hope
of
a
reconciliation
but
when
she
realised
that
hope
was
useless
in
her
despair
she
resolved
to
take
her
life
whether
she
actually
attempted
suicide
or
whether
imlay
learnt
of
her
intention
in
time
to
prevent
her
is
not
actually
known
imlay
was
at
this
time
engaged
in
trade
with
norway
and
requiring
a
trustworthy
representative
to
transact
some
confidential
business
it
was
thought
that
the
journey
would
restore
mary
health
and
spirits
she
therefore
consented
to
take
the
voyage
and
set
out
early
in
april
with
a
document
drawn
up
by
imlay
appointing
her
as
his
representative
and
describing
her
as
mary
imlay
my
best
friend
and
wife
and
concluding
thus
confiding
in
the
talent
zeal
and
earnestness
of
my
dearly
beloved
friend
and
companion
i
submit
the
management
of
these
affairs
entirely
and
implicitly
to
her
discretion
remaining
most
sincerely
and
affectionately
hers
truly
g
imlay
the
letters
describing
her
travels
excluding
any
personal
matters
were
issued
in
as
letters
from
sweden
and
norway
one
of
her
most
readable
books
the
portions
eliminated
from
these
letters
were
printed
by
godwin
in
his
wife
posthumous
works
and
are
given
in
the
present
volume
she
returned
to
england
early
in
october
with
a
heavy
heart
imlay
had
promised
to
meet
her
on
the
homeward
journey
possibly
at
hamburg
and
to
take
her
to
switzerland
but
she
hastened
to
london
to
find
her
suspicions
confirmed
he
provided
her
with
a
lodging
but
entirely
neglected
her
for
some
woman
with
whom
he
was
living
on
first
making
the
discovery
of
his
fresh
intrigue
and
in
her
agony
of
mind
she
sought
imlay
at
the
house
he
had
furnished
for
his
new
companion
the
conference
resulted
in
her
utter
despair
and
she
decided
to
drown
herself
she
first
went
to
battersea
bridge
but
found
too
many
people
there
and
therefore
walked
on
to
putney
it
was
night
and
raining
when
she
arrived
there
and
after
wandering
up
and
down
the
bridge
for
until
her
clothing
was
thoroughly
drenched
she
threw
herself
into
the
river
she
was
however
rescued
from
the
water
and
although
unconscious
her
life
was
saved
mary
met
imlay
casually
on
two
or
three
other
occasions
probably
her
last
sight
of
him
was
in
the
new
road
now
marylebone
road
when
he
alighted
from
his
horse
and
walked
with
her
some
time
and
the
passed
she
assured
godwin
without
producing
in
her
any
oppressive
emotion
mary
refused
to
accept
any
pecuniary
assistance
for
herself
from
imlay
but
he
gave
a
bond
for
a
sum
to
be
settled
on
her
the
interest
to
be
devoted
to
the
maintenance
of
their
child
neither
principal
nor
interest
however
was
ever
paid
what
ultimately
became
of
imlay
is
not
known
mary
at
length
resigned
herself
to
the
inevitable
her
old
friend
and
publisher
johnson
came
to
her
aid
and
she
resolved
to
resume
her
literary
work
for
the
support
of
herself
and
her
child
she
was
once
more
seen
in
literary
society
among
the
people
whom
she
met
at
this
time
was
william
godwin
three
years
her
senior
he
was
one
of
the
most
advanced
republicans
of
the
time
the
author
of
political
justice
and
the
novel
caleb
williams
they
had
met
before
for
the
first
time
in
november
but
she
displeased
godwin
because
her
vivacious
gossip
silenced
the
naturally
quiet
thomas
paine
whom
he
was
anxious
to
hear
talk
although
they
met
occasionally
afterwards
it
was
not
until
that
they
became
friendly
there
must
have
been
something
about
godwin
that
made
him
extremely
attractive
to
his
friends
for
he
numbered
among
them
some
of
the
most
charming
women
of
the
day
and
such
men
as
wordsworth
lamb
hazlitt
and
shelley
were
proud
to
be
of
his
circle
to
the
members
of
his
family
he
was
of
a
kind
even
affectionate
disposition
unfortunately
he
appears
to
the
worst
advantage
a
kind
of
early
pecksniff
in
his
later
correspondence
and
relations
with
shelley
and
it
is
by
this
correspondence
at
the
present
day
that
he
is
best
known
the
fine
portrait
of
godwin
by
northcote
in
the
national
portrait
gallery
preserves
for
us
all
the
beauty
of
his
intellectual
brow
and
eyes
another
portrait
of
godwin
with
a
long
sad
nose
by
pickersgill
once
to
be
seen
in
the
national
portrait
gallery
is
not
so
pleasing
in
a
letter
to
cottle
southey
gives
an
unflattering
portrait
of
godwin
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
which
seems
to
suggest
the
portrait
of
the
philosopher
he
has
large
noble
eyes
and
a
oh
most
abominable
nose
language
is
not
vituperatious
enough
to
describe
the
effect
of
its
downward
elongation
godwin
describes
his
courtship
with
mary
as
friendship
melting
into
love
they
agreed
to
live
together
but
godwin
took
rooms
about
twenty
doors
from
their
home
in
the
polygon
somers
town
as
it
was
one
of
his
theories
that
living
together
under
the
same
roof
is
destructive
of
family
happiness
godwin
went
to
his
rooms
as
soon
as
he
rose
in
the
morning
generally
without
taking
breakfast
with
mary
and
he
sometimes
slept
at
his
lodgings
they
rarely
met
again
until
unless
to
take
a
walk
together
during
the
day
this
extraordinary
couple
would
communicate
with
each
other
by
means
of
short
letters
or
notes
kegan
paul
prints
some
of
these
such
as
godwin
i
will
have
the
honour
to
dine
with
you
you
ask
me
whether
i
can
get
you
four
orders
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
not
think
the
thing
impossible
how
do
you
do
and
mary
fanny
is
delighted
with
the
thought
of
dining
with
you
but
i
wish
you
to
eat
your
meat
first
and
let
her
come
up
with
the
pudding
i
shall
probably
knock
at
your
door
on
my
way
to
opie
but
should
i
not
find
you
let
me
request
you
not
to
be
too
late
this
evening
do
not
give
fanny
butter
with
her
pudding
this
note
is
dated
april
and
probably
fixes
the
time
when
mary
was
sitting
for
her
portrait
to
opie
on
the
whole
godwin
and
mary
lived
happily
together
with
very
occasional
clouds
mainly
due
to
her
nature
and
his
confirmed
bachelor
habits
although
both
were
opposed
to
matrimony
on
principle
they
were
married
at
old
pancras
church
on
march
the
clerk
of
the
church
being
witness
godwin
does
not
mention
the
event
in
his
carefully
registered
diary
the
reason
for
the
marriage
was
that
mary
was
about
to
become
a
mother
and
it
was
for
the
sake
of
the
child
that
they
deemed
it
prudent
to
go
through
the
ceremony
but
it
was
not
made
public
at
once
chiefly
for
fear
that
johnson
should
cease
to
help
mary
inchbald
and
reveley
two
of
godwin
admirers
were
so
upset
at
the
announcement
of
his
marriage
that
they
shed
tears
an
interesting
description
of
mary
at
this
time
is
given
in
letter
to
cottle
quoted
above
dated
march
he
says
of
all
the
lions
or
i
have
seen
here
mary
imlay
countenance
is
the
best
infinitely
the
best
the
only
fault
in
it
is
an
expression
somewhat
similar
to
what
the
prints
of
horne
tooke
display
an
expression
indicating
superiority
not
haughtiness
not
sarcasm
in
mary
imlay
but
still
it
is
unpleasant
her
eyes
are
light
brown
and
although
the
lid
of
one
of
them
is
affected
by
a
little
paralysis
they
are
the
most
meaning
i
ever
saw
mary
busied
herself
with
literary
work
otherwise
her
short
married
life
was
uneventful
godwin
made
a
journey
with
his
friend
basil
montagu
to
staffordshire
from
june
to
and
the
correspondence
between
husband
and
wife
during
this
time
which
paul
prints
is
most
delightful
reading
and
shows
how
entirely
in
sympathy
they
were

probably

in

this

passed
from
godwin
hands
on
his
death
to
his
grandson
sir

it
was
afterwards
bequeathed
to

by

it
was
engraved
by
heath
for

of
his

an
engraving
of
it
also
appeared
in

which
the
frontispiece
to
this
book
was
made
and
a
mezzotint
by

child

born
not
the
william
so
much
desired
by
them
both
but
mary
who
afterwards
became
shelley
all
seemed
well
with
the
mother
until
september
when
alarming
symptoms
appeared
the
best
medical
advice
was
obtained
but
after
a
week
illness
on
sunday
morning
the
at
twenty
minutes
to
eight
she
sank
and
died
during
her
illness
when
in
great
agony
an
anodyne
was
administered
which
gave
mary
some
relief
when
she
exclaimed
oh
godwin
i
am
in
heaven
but
as
kegan
paul
says
even
at
that
moment
godwin
declined
to
be
entrapped
into
the
admission
that
heaven
existed
and
his
instant
reply
was
you
mean
my
dear
that
your
physical
sensations
are
somewhat
easier
mary
godwin
however
did
not
share
her
husband
religious
doubts
her
sufferings
had
been
great
but
her
death
was
a
peaceful
one
godwin
grief
was
very
deep
as
the
letters
that
he
wrote
immediately
after
her
death
and
his
tribute
to
her
memory
in
the
memoirs
testify
mary
godwin
was
buried
in
old
pancras
churchyard
on
september
in
the
presence
of
most
of
her
friends
godwin
lived
till
when
he
was
laid
beside
her
many
years
afterwards
at
the
same
graveside

is
said
to
have
plighted
his
troth

mary
godwin
daughter
in

the
metropolitan
and
midland
railways
were
constructed
at
pancras
the
graveyard
was
destroyed
but
the
bodies
of
mary
and
william
godwin
were
removed
by
their
grandson
sir
percy
shelley
to
bournemouth
where
they
now
rest
with
his
remains
and
those
of
his

the

a
somewhat
mixed
one

it
did
of

two
children
charles
and
claire

and
also
of

the
only
child
born
of
her
marriage
with

in
shelley
began
a
correspondence
with
godwin
which
ultimately
led
to
mary
godwin
elopement
with
the
poet
poor
fanny
imlay
or
godwin
as
she
was
called
after
her
mother
death
died
at
the
age
of
nineteen
by
her
own
hand
in
october
her
life
had
been
far
from
happy
in
this
strange
household
she
had
grown
to
love
shelley
but
his
choice
had
fallen
on
her
so
she
bravely
kept
her
secret
to
herself
one
day
she
suddenly
left
home
and
travelled
to
swansea
where
she
was
found
lying
dead
the
morning
after
her
arrival
in
the
inn
where
she
had
taken
a
room
her
long
brown
hair
about
her
face
a
bottle
of
laudanum
upon
the
table
and
a
note
which
ran
thus
have
long
determined
that
the
best
thing
i
could
do
was
to
put
an
end
to
the
existence
of
a
being
whose
birth
was
unfortunate
and
whose
life
has
only
been
a
series
of
pain
to
those
persons
who
have
hurt
their
health
in
endeavouring
to
promote
her
welfare
she
had
with
her
the
little
genevan
watch
a
gift
of
travel
from
mary
and
shelley
and
in
her
purse
were
a
few
shillings
shelley
afterwards
recalling
his
last
interview
with
fanny
in
london
wrote
this
stanza
her
voice
did
quiver
as
we
parted
yet
knew
i
not
that
heart
was
broken
from
whence
it
came
and
i
departed
heeding
not
the
words
then
spoken
misery
o
misery
this
world
is
all
too
wide
for
thee
iii
the
vicissitudes
to
which
mary
wollstonecraft
was
so
largely
a
prey
during
her
lifetime
seem
to
have
pursued
her
after
death
in
her
own
day
recognised
as
a
public
character
reviled
by
most
of
her
contemporaries
in
terms
not
less
ungentle
than
horace
walpole
epithets
a
hyena
in
petticoats
or
a
philosophising
serpent
posterity
has
proved
hardly
more
lenient
to
her
but
the
vigorous
work
of
this
female
patriot
has
saved
her
name
from
that
descent
into
obscurity
which
is
the
reward
of
many
men
and
women
more
talented
than
mary
wollstonecraft
reputed
chiefly
as
an
unsexed
being
who
had
written
a
vindication
of
the
rights
of
women
she
was
not
the
first
woman
to
hold
views
on
the
emancipation
of
her
sex
but
her
chief
crimes
were
in
expressing
them
for
the
instruction
of
the
public
and
having
the
courage
to
live
up
to
her
opinions
whether
right
or
wrong
she
paid
the
penalty
of
violating
custom
by
discussing
forbidden
subjects
it
is
true
that
she
detected
many
social
evils
and
suggested
some
excellent
remedies
for
their
amelioration
but
the
time
was
not
ripe
for
her
book
and
she
suffered
the
usual
fate
of
the
pioneer
moreover
her
memoir
by
william
godwin
beautiful
as
it
is
in
many
respects
exercised
a
distinctly
harmful
influence
in
regard
to
her
memory
the
very
fact
that
she
became
the
wife
of
so
notorious
a
man
was
sufficient
reason
to
condemn
her
in
the
eyes
of
her
countrymen
for
two
generations
after
her
death
practically
no
attempt
was
made
to
remove
the
stigma
from
her
name
but
at
length
the
late
kegan
paul
a
man
of
wide
and
generous
sympathies
made
a
serious
effort
to
obtain
something
like
justice
for
mary
wollstonecraft
in
his
book
on
william
godwin
published
in
the
true
story
of
mary
life
was
told
for
the
first
time
it
was
somewhat
of
a
revelation
for
it
recorded
the
history
of
an
unhappy
but
brave
and
loyal
woman
whose
faults
proceeded
from
excessive
sensibility
and
from
a
heart
that
was
mary
wollstonecraft
was
an
idealist
in
a
very
age
and
her
outlook
on
life
like
that
of
most
idealists
was
strongly
affected
by
her
imagination
she
saw
people
and
events
in
brilliant
lights
or
sombre
shadows
it
was
a
power
akin
to
enthusiasm
which
enabled
her
to
produce
some
of
her
best
writing
but
it
also
prevented
her
from
seeing
the
defects
of
her
worst
work
since
kegan
paul
memoir
mary
wollstonecraft
has
been
viewed
from
an
entirely
different
aspect
and
many
there
are
who
have
come
under
the
spell
of
her
fascinating
personality
it
is
not
however
her
message
alone
that
now
interests
us
but
the
woman
herself
her
desires
her
aspirations
her
struggles
and
her
love
pathetic
and
lonely
she
stands
out
in
the
faint
mists
of
the
past
a
woman
that
will
continue
to
evoke
sympathy
when
her
books
are
no
longer
read
but
it
is
safe
to
predict
that
the
pages
reprinted
in
this
volume
are
not
destined
to
share
the
fate
of
the
rest
of
her
work
other
writers
have
been
unhappy
and
have
known
the
pains
of
unrequited
love
but
mary
wollstonecraft
addressed
these
letters
with
a
breaking
heart
to
the
man
whom
she
adored
the
most
passionate
love
letters
in
our
literature
it
is
true
that
she
was
a
votary
of
rousseau
and
that
she
had
probably
assimilated
from
the
study
of
his
work
not
only
many
of
his
views
but
something
of
his
style
it
does
not
however
appear
that
she
had
any
motive
in
writing
these
letters
other
than
to
plead
her
cause
with
imlay
she
was
far
too
sensitive
to
have
intended
them
for
publication
and
it
was
only
by
a
mere
chance
that
they
were
rescued

oblivion

my

taken
by

obliged
to
promise
to
dine
at

the

leave

hope
to
find
you
at
my
when
i
return
about
eight
will
you
not
wait
for
poor
joan
whom
you
will
find
better
and
till
then

very
affectionately
of

yours

sitting
down

do
not

twelve
monday
night

i
obey
an
emotion
of
my
heart
which
made
me
think
of
wishing
thee
my
love
before
i
go
to
rest
with
more
tenderness
than
i
can
when
writing
a
hasty
line
or
two
under

eye
you
can
scarcely
imagine
with
what
pleasure
i
anticipate
the
day
when
we
are
to
begin
almost
to
live
together
and
you
would
smile
to
hear
how
many
plans
of
employment
i
have
in
my
head
now
that
i
am
confident
my
heart
has
found
peace
in
your
cherish
me
with
that
dignified
tenderness
which
i
have
only
found
in
you
and
your
own
dear
girl
will
try
to
keep
under
a
quickness
of
feeling
that
has
sometimes
given
you
yes
i
will
be
that
i
may
deserve
to
be
happy
and
whilst
you
love
me
i
can
not
again
fall
into
the
miserable
state
which
rendered
life
a
burthen
almost
too
heavy
to
be
borne

god
bless
you
sterne
says
that
is

i

rather
give
you
the

into
the
bargain
glowing
with
gratitude
to
heaven
and
affection
to
you
i
like
the

affection
because
it
signifies
something
habitual

letter
iii
morning
paris
you
have
often
called
me
dear
girl
but
you
would
now
say
good
did
you
know
how
very
attentive
i
have
been
to
the
ever
since
i
came
to
paris
i
am
not
however
going
to
trouble
you
with
the
account
because
i
like
to
see
your
eyes
praise
me
and
milton
insinuates
that
during
such
recitals
there
are
interruptions
not
ungrateful
to
the
heart
when
the
honey
that
drops
from
the
lips
is
not
merely
words
yet
i
shall
not
let
me
tell
you
before
these
people
enter
to
force
me
to
huddle
away
my
letter
be
content
with
only
a
kiss
of
duty
you
be
glad
to
see
me
because
you
are
glad
or
i
will
make
love
to
the
of
mirabeau
to
whom
my
heart
continually
turned
whilst
i
was
talking
with
madame
forcibly
telling
me
that
it
will
ever
have
sufficient
warmth
to
love
whether
i
will
or
not
sentiment
though
i
so
highly
respect
not
that
i
think
mirabeau
utterly
devoid
of
principles
far
from
it
and
if
i
had
not
begun
to
form
a
new
theory
respecting
men
i
should
in
the
vanity
of
my
heart
have
that
could
have
made
something
of
his
it
was
composed
of
such
materials
hush
here
they
come
and
love
flies
away
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
leaving
a
little
brush
of
his
wing
on
my
pale
cheeks
i
hope
to
see
this
morning
i
am
going
to
to
meet
him
and
some
others
are
invited
to
dine
with
us
and
i
am
to
spend
the
day
with
i
shall
probably
not
be
able
to
return
to
but
it
is
no
matter
because
i
must
take
a
carriage
i
have
so
many
books
that
i
immediately
want
to
take
with
on
friday
then
i
shall
expect
you
to
dine
with
me
and
if
you
come
a
little
before
dinner
it
is
so
long
since
i
have
seen
you
you
will
not
be
scolded
by
yours
affectionately

letter
iv
morning
paris
a
man
whom
a
letter
from
previously
announced
called
here
yesterday
for
the
payment
of
a
draft
and
as
he
seemed
disappointed
at
not
finding
you
at
home
i
sent
him
to
i
have
since
seen
him
and
he
tells
me
that
he
has
settled
the
business
so
much
for
business
may
i
venture
to
talk
a
little
longer
about
less
weighty
affairs
how
are
you
i
have
been
following
you
all
along
the
road
this
comfortless
weather
for
when
i
am
absent
from
those
i
love
my
imagination
is
as
lively
as
if
my
senses
had
never
been
gratified
by
their
presence
i
was
going
to
say
caresses
and
why
should
i
not
i
have
found
out
that
i
have
more
mind
than
you
in
one
respect
because
i
can
without
any
violent
effort
of
reason
find
food
for
love
in
the
same
object
much
longer
than
you
the
way
to
my
senses
is
through
my
heart
but
forgive
me
i
think
there
is
sometimes
a
shorter
cut
to
yours
with
men
out
of
a
hundred
a
very
sufficient
dash
of
folly
is
necessary
to
render
a
woman
a
soft
word
for
desirable
and
beyond
these
casual
ebullitions
of
sympathy
few
look
for
enjoyment
by
fostering
a
passion
in
their
hearts
one
reason
in
short
why
i
wish
my
whole
sex
to
become
wiser
is
that
the
foolish
ones
may
not
by
their
pretty
folly
rob
those
whose
sensibility
keeps
down
their
vanity
of
the
few
roses
that
afford
them
some
solace
in
the
thorny
road
of
life
i
do
not
know
how
i
fell
into
these
reflections
excepting
one
thought
produced
it
that
these
continual
separations
were
necessary
to
warm
your
of
late
we
are
always
crack
crack
and
away
you
this
joke
wears
the
sallow
cast
of
thought
for
though
i
began
to
write
cheerfully
some
melancholy
tears
have
found
their
way
into
my
eyes
that
linger
there
whilst
a
glow
of
tenderness
at
my
heart
whispers
that
you
are
one
of
the
best
creatures
in
the
pardon
then
the
vagaries
of
a
mind
that
has
been
almost
crazed
by
care
as
well
as
crossed
in
hapless
love
and
bear
with
me
a
longer
when
we
are
settled
in
the
country
together
more
duties
will
open
before
me
and
my
heart
which
now
trembling
into
peace
is
agitated
by
every
emotion
that
awakens
the
remembrance
of
old
griefs
will
learn
to
rest
on
yours
with
that
dignity
your
character
not
to
talk
of
my
own
demands
take
care
of
yourself
and
write
soon
to
your
own
girl
you
may
add
dear
if
you
please
who
sincerely
loves
you
and
will
try
to
convince
you
of
it
by
becoming
happier
mary
letter
v
night
paris
i
have
just
received
your
letter
and
feel
as
if
i
could
not
go
to
bed
tranquilly
without
saying
a
few
words
in
reply
merely
to
tell
you
that
my
mind
is
serene
and
my
heart
affectionate
ever
since
you
last
saw
me
inclined
to
faint
i
have
felt
some
gentle
twitches
which
make
me
begin
to
think
that
i
am
nourishing
a
creature
who
will
soon
be
sensible
of
my
this
thought
has
not
only
produced
an
overflowing
of
tenderness
to
you
but
made
me
very
attentive
to
calm
my
mind
and
take
exercise
lest
i
should
destroy
an
object
in
whom
we
are
to
have
a
mutual
interest
you
know
yesterday
do
not
smile
finding
that
i
had
hurt
myself
by
lifting
precipitately
a
large
log
of
wood
i
sat
down
in
an
agony
till
i
felt
those
said
twitches
again
are
you
very
busy
so
you
may
reckon
on
its
being
finished
soon
though
not
before
you
come
home
unless
you
are
detained
longer
than
i
now
allow
myself
to
believe
you
be
that
as
it
may
write
to
me
my
best
love
and
bid
me
be
patient
kindly
and
the
expressions
of
kindness
will
again
beguile
the
time
as
sweetly
as
they
have
done
tell
me
also
over
and
over
again
that
your
happiness
and
you
deserve
to
be
happy
is
closely
connected
with
mine
and
i
will
try
to
dissipate
as
they
rise
the
fumes
of
former
discontent
that
have
too
often
clouded
the
sunshine
which
you
have
endeavoured
to
diffuse
through
my
mind
god
bless
you
take
care
of
yourself
and
remember
with
tenderness
your
affectionate
mary
i
am
going
to
rest
very
happy
and
you
have
made
me
this
is
the
kindest
i
can
utter
letter
vi
morning
paris
i
am
glad
to
find
that
other
people
can
be
unreasonable
as
well
as
myself
for
be
it
known
to
thee
that
i
answered
thy
letter
the
very
night
it
reached
me
sunday
though
thou
couldst
not
receive
it
before
wednesday
because
it
was
not
sent
off
till
the
next
there
is
a
full
true
and
particular
yet
i
am
not
angry
with
thee
my
love
for
i
think
that
it
is
a
proof
of
stupidity
and
likewise
of
a
affection
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
when
the
temper
is
governed
by
a
square
and
there
is
nothing
picturesque
in
this
equality
and
the
passions
always
give
grace
to
the
actions
recollection
now
makes
my
heart
bound
to
thee
but
it
is
not
to
thy
face
though
i
can
not
be
seriously
displeased
with
the
exertion
which
increases
my
esteem
or
rather
is
what
i
should
have
expected
from
thy
no
i
have
thy
honest
countenance
before
me
pop
relaxed
by
tenderness
a
little
little
wounded
by
my
whims
and
thy
eyes
glistening
with
thy
lips
then
feel
softer
than
soft
and
i
rest
my
cheek
on
thine
forgetting
all
the
i
have
not
left
the
hue
of
love
out
of
the
picture
the
rosy
glow
and
fancy
has
spread
it
over
my
own
cheeks
i
believe
for
i
feel
them
burning
whilst
a
delicious
tear
trembles
in
my
eye
that
would
be
all
your
own
if
a
grateful
emotion
directed
to
the
father
of
nature
who
has
made
me
thus
alive
to
happiness
did
not
give
more
warmth
to
the
sentiment
it
divides
i
must
pause
a
moment
need
i
tell
you
that
i
am
tranquil
after
writing
thus
i
do
not
know
why
but
i
have
more
confidence
in
your
affection
when
absent
than
present
nay
i
think
that
you
must
love
me
for
in
the
sincerity
of
my
heart
let
me
say
it
i
believe
i
deserve
your
tenderness
because
i
am
true
and
have
a
degree
of
sensibility
that
you
can
see
and
relish
yours
sincerely
mary
letter
vii
morning
paris
you
seem
to
have
taken
up
your
abode
at
havre
pray
sir
when
do
you
think
of
coming
home
or
to
write
very
considerately
when
will
business
permit
you
i
shall
expect
as
the
country
people
say
in
england
that
you
will
make
a
of
money
to
indemnify
me
for
your
absence
well
but
my
love
to
the
old
story
am
i
to
see
you
this
week
or
this
month
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
about
for
as
you
did
not
tell
me
i
would
not
ask
who
is
generally
pretty
communicative
i
long
to
see
not
to
hear
from
you
so
do
not
give
yourself
airs
but
to
get
a
letter
from
and
i
am
half
angry
with
you
for
not
informing
me
whether
she
had
brought
one
with
her
or
on
this
score
i
will
cork
up
some
of
the
kind
things
that
were
ready
to
drop
from
my
pen
which
has
never
been
dipt
in
gall
when
addressing
you
or
will
only
suffer
an
exclamation
the
creature
or
a
kind
look
to
escape
me
when
i
pass
the
slippers
which
i
could
not
remove
from
my
door
though
they
are
not
the
handsomest
of
their
kind
not
too
anxious
to
get
money
for
nothing
worth
having
is
to
be
god
bless
you
yours
affectionately
mary
letter
viii
night
paris
my
best
love
your
letter
was
particularly
grateful
to
my
heart
depressed
by
the
letters
i
received
by
for
he
brought
me
several
and
the
parcel
of
books
directed
to
was
for
me
letter
was
long
and
very
affectionate
but
the
account
he
gives
me
of
his
own
affairs
though
he
obviously
makes
the
best
of
them
has
vexed
me
a
melancholy
letter
from
my
sister
has
also
harrassed
my
mind
that
from
my
brother
would
have
given
me
sincere
pleasure
but
for
there
is
a
spirit
of
independence
in
his
letter
that
will
please
you
and
you
shall
see
it
when
we
are
once
more
over
the
fire
i
think
that
you
would
hail
him
as
a
brother
with
one
of
your
tender
looks
when
your
heart
not
only
gives
a
lustre
to
your
eye
but
a
dance
of
playfulness
that
he
would
meet
with
a
glow
half
made
up
of
bashfulness
and
a
desire
to
please
the
where
shall
i
find
a
word
to
express
the
relationship
which
subsists
between
us
shall
i
ask
the
little
twitcher
but
i
have
dropt
half
the
sentence
that
was
to
tell
you
how
much
he
would
be
inclined
to
love
the
man
loved
by
his
sister
i
have
been
fancying
myself
sitting
between
you
ever
since
i
began
to
write
and
my
heart
has
leaped
at
the
thought
you
see
how
i
chat
to
you
i
did
not
receive
your
letter
till
i
came
home
and
i
did
not
expect
it
for
the
post
came
in
much
later
than
usual
it
was
a
cordial
to
me
and
i
wanted
one
tells
me
that
he
has
written
again
and
love
him
a
little
it
would
be
a
kind
of
separation
if
you
did
not
love
those
i
love
there
was
so
much
considerate
tenderness
in
your
epistle
that
if
it
has
not
made
you
dearer
to
me
it
has
made
me
forcibly
feel
how
very
dear
you
are
to
me
by
charming
away
half
my
cares
yours
affectionately
mary
letter
ix
morning
paris
though
i
have
just
sent
a
letter
off
yet
as
captain
offers
to
take
one
i
am
not
willing
to
let
him
go
without
a
kind
greeting
because
trifles
of
this
sort
without
having
any
effect
on
my
mind
damp
my
spirits
and
you
with
all
your
struggles
to
be
manly
have
some
of
his
same
do
not
bid
it
begone
for
i
love
to
see
it
striving
to
master
your
features
besides
these
kind
of
sympathies
are
the
life
of
affection
and
why
in
cultivating
our
understandings
should
we
try
to
dry
up
these
springs
of
pleasure
which
gush
out
to
give
a
freshness
to
days
browned
by
care
the
books
sent
to
me
are
such
as
we
may
read
together
so
i
shall
not
look
into
them
till
you
return
when
you
shall
read
whilst
i
mend
my
stockings
yours
truly
mary
letter
x
night
paris
as
i
have
been
you
tell
me
three
days
without
writing
i
ought
not
to
complain
of
two
yet
as
i
expected
to
receive
a
letter
this
afternoon
i
am
hurt
and
why
should
i
by
concealing
it
affect
the
heroism
i
do
not
feel
i
hate
commerce
how
differently
must
head
and
heart
be
organized
from
mine
you
will
tell
me
that
exertions
are
necessary
i
am
weary
of
them
the
face
of
things
public
and
private
vexes
me
the
peace
and
clemency
which
seemed
to
be
dawning
a
few
days
ago
disappear
again
i
am
fallen
as
milton
said
on
evil
days
for
i
really
believe
that
europe
will
be
in
a
state
of
convulsion
during
half
a
century
at
least
life
is
but
a
labour
of
patience
it
is
always
rolling
a
great
stone
up
a
hill
for
before
a
person
can
find
a
imagining
it
is
lodged
down
it
comes
again
and
all
the
work
is
to
be
done
over
anew
should
i
attempt
to
write
any
more
i
could
not
change
the
strain
my
head
aches
and
my
heart
is
heavy
the
world
appears
an
unweeded
garden
where
things
rank
and
vile
flourish
best
if
you
do
not
return
soon
or
which
is
no
such
mighty
matter
talk
of
it
i
will
throw
your
slippers
out
at
window
and
be
off
nobody
knows
where
mary
finding
that
i
was
observed
i
told
the
good
women
the
two
s
simply
that
i
was
with
child
and
let
them
stare
and
and
nay
all
the
world
may
know
it
for
aught
i
care
yet
i
wish
to
avoid
coarse
jokes
considering
the
care
and
anxiety
a
woman
must
have
about
a
child
before
it
comes
into
the
world
it
seems
to
me
by
a
to
belong
to
her
when
men
get
immersed
in
the
world
they
seem
to
lose
all
sensations
excepting
those
necessary
to
continue
or
produce
life
are
these
the
privileges
of
reason
amongst
the
feathered
race
whilst
the
hen
keeps
the
young
warm
her
mate
stays
by
to
cheer
her
but
it
is
sufficient
for
man
to
condescend
to
get
a
child
in
order
to
claim
a
man
is
a
tyrant
you
may
now
tell
me
that
if
it
were
not
for
me
you
would
be
laughing
away
with
some
honest
fellows
in
london
the
casual
exercise
of
social
sympathy
would
not
be
sufficient
for
me
i
should
not
think
such
an
heartless
life
worth
it
is
necessary
to
be
in
with
you
to
be
pleased
with
the
world
morning
paris
i
was
very
last
night
ready
to
quarrel
with
your
cheerful
temper
which
makes
absence
easy
to
and
why
should
i
mince
the
matter
i
was
offended
at
your
not
even
mentioning
it
i
do
not
want
to
be
loved
like
a
goddess
but
i
wish
to
be
necessary
to
you
god
bless
you
letter
xi
night
paris
i
have
just
received
your
kind
and
rational
letter
and
would
fain
hide
my
face
glowing
with
shame
for
my
i
would
hide
it
in
your
bosom
if
you
would
again
open
it
to
me
and
nestle
closely
till
you
bade
my
fluttering
heart
be
still
by
saying
that
you
forgave
me
with
eyes
overflowing
with
tears
and
in
the
humblest
attitude
i
entreat
do
not
turn
from
me
for
indeed
i
love
you
fondly
and
have
been
very
wretched
since
the
night
i
was
so
cruelly
hurt
by
thinking
that
you
had
no
confidence
in
me
it
is
time
for
me
to
grow
more
reasonable
a
few
more
of
these
caprices
of
sensibility
would
destroy
me
i
have
in
fact
been
very
much
indisposed
for
a
few
days
past
and
the
notion
that
i
was
tormenting
or
perhaps
killing
a
poor
little
animal
about
whom
i
am
grown
anxious
and
tender
now
i
feel
it
alive
made
me
worse
my
bowels
have
been
dreadfully
disordered
and
every
thing
i
ate
or
drank
disagreed
with
my
stomach
still
i
feel
intimations
of
its
existence
though
they
have
been
fainter
do
you
think
that
the
creature
goes
regularly
to
sleep
i
am
ready
to
ask
as
many
questions
as
voltaire
man
of
forty
crowns
ah
do
not
continue
to
be
angry
with
me
you
perceive
that
i
am
already
smiling
through
my
tears
you
have
lightened
my
heart
and
my
frozen
spirits
are
melting
into
playfulness
write
the
moment
you
receive
this
i
shall
count
the
minutes
but
drop
not
an
angry
word
i
can
not
now
bear
it
yet
if
you
think
i
deserve
a
scolding
it
does
not
admit
of
a
question
i
grant
wait
till
you
come
back
and
then
if
you
are
angry
one
day
i
shall
be
sure
of
seeing
you
the
next
did
not
write
to
you
i
suppose
because
he
talked
of
going
to
havre
hearing
that
i
was
ill
he
called
very
kindly
on
me
not
dreaming
that
it
was
some
words
that
he
incautiously
let
fall
which
rendered
me
so
god
bless
you
my
love
do
not
shut
your
heart
against
a
return
of
tenderness
and
as
i
now
in
fancy
cling
to
you
be
more
than
ever
my
feel
but
as
affectionate
when
you
read
this
letter
as
i
did
writing
it
and
you
will
make
happy
your
mary
letter
xii
morning
paris
i
will
never
if
i
am
not
entirely
cured
of
quarrelling
begin
to
encourage
fancies
when
we
are
separated
yesterday
my
love
i
could
not
open
your
letter
for
some
time
and
though
it
was
not
half
as
severe
as
i
merited
it
threw
me
into
such
a
fit
of
trembling
as
seriously
alarmed
me
i
did
not
as
you
may
suppose
care
for
a
little
pain
on
my
own
account
but
all
the
fears
which
i
have
had
for
a
few
days
past
returned
with
fresh
force
this
morning
i
am
better
will
you
not
be
glad
to
hear
it
you
perceive
that
sorrow
has
almost
made
a
child
of
me
and
that
i
want
to
be
soothed
to
peace
one
thing
you
mistake
in
my
character
and
imagine
that
to
be
coldness
which
is
just
the
contrary
for
when
i
am
hurt
by
the
person
most
dear
to
me
i
must
let
out
a
whole
torrent
of
emotions
in
which
tenderness
would
be
uppermost
or
stifle
them
altogether
and
it
appears
to
me
almost
a
duty
to
stifle
them
when
i
imagine
i
am
treated
with
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
vexed
you
my
own
imlay
i
know
the
quickness
of
your
feelings
and
let
me
in
the
sincerity
of
my
heart
assure
you
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
suffer
to
make
you
happy
my
own
happiness
wholly
depends
on
you
and
knowing
you
when
my
reason
is
not
clouded
i
look
forward
to
a
rational
prospect
of
as
much
felicity
as
the
earth
affords
with
a
little
dash
of
rapture
into
the
bargain
if
you
will
look
at
me
when
we
work
again
as
you
have
sometimes
greeted
your
humbled
yet
most
affectionate
mary
letter
xiii
night
paris
i
have
been
wishing
the
time
away
my
kind
love
unable
to
rest
till
i
knew
that
my
penitential
letter
had
reached
your
hand
and
this
afternoon
when
your
tender
epistle
of
tuesday
gave
such
exquisite
pleasure
to
your
poor
sick
girl
her
heart
smote
her
to
think
that
you
were
still
to
receive
another
cold
burn
it
also
my
imlay
yet
do
not
forget
that
even
those
letters
were
full
of
love
and
i
shall
ever
recollect
that
you
did
not
wait
to
be
mollified
by
my
penitence
before
you
took
me
again
to
your
heart
i
have
been
unwell
and
would
not
now
i
am
recovering
take
a
journey
because
i
have
been
seriously
alarmed
and
angry
with
myself
dreading
continually
the
fatal
consequence
of
my
but
should
you
think
it
right
to
remain
at
havre
i
shall
find
some
opportunity
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight
or
less
perhaps
to
come
to
you
and
before
then
i
shall
be
strong
yet
do
not
be
uneasy
i
am
really
better
and
never
took
such
care
of
myself
as
i
have
done
since
you
restored
my
peace
of
mind
the
girl
is
come
to
warm
my
bed
so
i
will
tenderly
say
and
write
a
line
or
two
in
the
morning
i
wish
you
were
here
to
walk
with
me
this
fine
morning
yet
your
absence
shall
not
prevent
me
i
have
stayed
at
home
too
much
though
when
i
was
so
dreadfully
out
of
spirits
i
was
careless
of
every
thing
i
will
now
sally
forth
you
will
go
with
me
in
my
heart
and
try
whether
this
fine
bracing
air
will
not
give
the
vigour
to
the
poor
babe
it
had
before
i
so
inconsiderately
gave
way
to
the
grief
that
deranged
my
bowels
and
gave
a
turn
to
my
whole
system
yours
truly
mary
imlay
letter
xiv
morning
paris
the
two
or
three
letters
which
i
have
written
to
you
lately
my
love
will
serve
as
an
answer
to
your
explanatory
one
i
can
not
but
respect
your
motives
and
conduct
i
always
respected
them
and
was
only
hurt
by
what
seemed
to
me
a
want
of
confidence
and
consequently
i
thought
also
that
if
you
were
obliged
to
stay
three
months
at
havre
i
might
as
well
have
been
with
well
well
what
signifies
what
i
brooded
over
let
us
now
be
friends
i
shall
probably
receive
a
letter
from
you
sealing
my
pardon
and
i
will
be
careful
not
to
torment
you
with
my
querulous
humours
at
least
till
i
see
you
again
act
as
circumstances
direct
and
i
will
not
enquire
when
they
will
permit
you
to
return
convinced
that
you
will
hasten
to
your
mary
when
you
have
attained
or
lost
sight
of
the
object
of
your
journey
what
a
picture
have
you
sketched
of
our
yes
my
love
my
fancy
was
instantly
at
work
and
i
found
my
head
on
your
shoulder
whilst
my
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
little
creatures
that
were
clinging
about
your
knees
i
did
not
absolutely
determine
that
there
should
be
six
if
you
have
not
set
your
heart
on
this
round
number
i
am
going
to
dine
with
i
have
not
been
to
visit
her
since
the
first
day
she
came
to
paris
i
wish
indeed
to
be
out
in
the
air
as
much
as
i
can
for
the
exercise
i
have
taken
these
two
or
three
days
past
has
been
of
such
service
to
me
that
i
hope
shortly
to
tell
you
that
i
am
quite
well
i
have
scarcely
slept
before
last
night
and
then
not
the
two
s
have
been
very
anxious
and
tender
yours
truly
mary
i
need
not
desire
you
to
give
the
colonel
a
good
bottle
of
wine
letter
xv
morning
paris
i
wrote
to
you
yesterday
my
imlay
but
finding
that
the
colonel
is
still
detained
for
his
passport
was
forgotten
at
the
office
yesterday
i
am
not
willing
to
let
so
many
days
elapse
without
your
hearing
from
me
after
having
talked
of
illness
and
apprehensions
i
can
not
boast
of
being
quite
recovered
yet
i
am
i
must
use
my
yorkshire
phrase
for
when
my
heart
is
warm
pop
come
the
expressions
of
childhood
into
my
head
so
that
i
think
it
will
not
badly
with
and
nothing
shall
be
wanting
on
my
part
i
assure
you
for
i
am
urged
on
not
only
by
an
enlivened
affection
for
you
but
by
a
tenderness
that
plays
cheerly
round
my
dilating
heart
i
was
therefore
in
defiance
of
cold
and
dirt
out
in
the
air
the
greater
part
of
yesterday
and
if
i
get
over
this
evening
without
a
return
of
the
fever
that
has
tormented
me
i
shall
talk
no
more
of
illness
i
have
promised
the
little
creature
that
its
mother
who
ought
to
cherish
it
will
not
again
plague
it
and
begged
it
to
pardon
me
and
since
i
could
not
hug
either
it
or
you
to
my
breast
i
have
to
my
i
am
afraid
to
read
over
this
prattle
but
it
is
only
for
your
eye
i
have
been
seriously
vexed
to
find
that
whilst
you
were
harrassed
by
impediments
in
your
undertakings
i
was
giving
you
additional
if
you
can
make
any
of
your
plans
answer
it
is
well
i
do
not
think
a
money
inconvenient
but
should
they
fail
we
will
struggle
cheerfully
together
drawn
closer
by
the
pinching
blasts
of
poverty
adieu
my
love
write
often
to
your
poor
girl
and
write
long
letters
for
i
not
only
like
them
for
being
longer

because
more
heart
steals
into
them
and
i
am
happy
to
catch
your
heart
whenever
i

you
have
by
your

twisted
yourself
more
artfully
round
my

i

thought
that
i
have
thrown
out
some
tendrils
to
cling
to
the
elm
by

find
you
well

composed
i
am
sure
or
more
properly
speaking
what
is
the
reason
that
my
spirits
are
not
as
manageable
as
yours
yet
now
i
think
of
it
i
will
not
allow
that
your
temper
is
even
though
i
have
promised
myself
in
order
to
obtain
my
own
forgiveness
that
i
will
not
ruffle
it

a
long
long

i

say
never
farewell
for
a

do
not

that
i
am
driving

you
in

my
mind
unfettered
has
flown
to
you
long
since
or
rather
has
never
left
you
i
am
well

have
no
apprehension
that
i

find
the

too
fatiguing

morning
havre
march
we
are
such
creatures
of
habit
my
love
that
though
i
can
not
say
i
was
sorry
childishly
so
for
your
going
when
i
knew
that
you
were
to
stay
such
a
short
time
and
i
had
a
plan
of
employment
yet
i
could
not
i
turned
to
your
side
of
the
bed
and
tried
to
make
the
most
of
the
comfort
of
the
pillow
which
you
used
to
tell
me
i
was
churlish
about
but
all
would
not
i
took
nevertheless
my
walk
before
breakfast
though
the
weather
was
not
very
inviting
and
here
i
am
wishing
you
a
finer
day
and
seeing
you
peep
over
my
shoulder
as
i
write
with
one
of
your
kindest
looks
when
your
eyes
glisten
and
a
suffusion
creeps
over
your
relaxing
features
but
i
do
not
mean
to
dally
with
you
this
morning
so
god
bless
you
take
care
of
yourself
and
sometimes
fold
to
your
heart

of
being
in
love
at
the
of
a

you

you

you
by

your

i
closed
my

up

sunday

i
have
promised
to
go
with
him
to
his
where
he
is
now
permitted
to
dine
i
and
the
little
darling
to
be
sure
whom
i
can
not
help
kissing
with
more
fondness
since
you
left
us
i
think
i
shall
enjoy
the
fine
prospect
and
that
it
will
rather
enliven
than
satiate
my
imagination
i
have
called
on
she
has
the
manners
of
a
gentlewoman
with
a
dash
of
the
easy
french
coquetry
which
renders
her
but
her
husband
whom
nature
never
dreamed
of
casting
in
either
the
mould
of
a
gentleman
or
lover
makes
but
an
aukward
figure
in
the
foreground
of
the
picture
the
h
s
are
very
ugly
without
doubt
and
the
house
smelt
of
commerce
from
top
to
toe
so
that
his
abortive
attempt
to
display
taste
only
proved
it
to
be
one
of
the
things
not
to
be
bought
with
gold
i
was
in
a
room
a
moment
alone
and
my
attention
was
attracted
by
the
a
nymph
was
offering
up
her
vows
before
a
smoking
altar
to
a
cupid
saving
your
presence
who
was
kicking
his
heels
in
the
ah
kick
on
thought
i
for
the
demon
of
traffic
will
ever
fright
away
the
loves
and
graces
that
streak
with
the
rosy
beams
of
infant
fancy
the
day
of
life
whilst
the
imagination
not
allowing
us
to
see
things
as
they
are
enables
us
to
catch
a
hasty
draught
of
the
running
stream
of
delight
the
thirst
for
which
seems
to
be
given
only
to
tantalize
us
but
i
am
philosophizing
nay
perhaps
you
will
call
me
severe
and
bid
me
let
the
peace
to
them
though
none
of
the
social
sprites
and
there
are
not
a
few
of
different
descriptions
who
sport
about
the
various
inlets
to
my
heart
gave
me
a
twitch
to
restrain
my
pen
i
have
been
writing
on
expecting
poor
to
come
for
when
i
began
i
merely
thought
of
business
and
as
this
is
the
idea
that
most
naturally
associates
with
your
image
i
wonder
i
stumbled
on
any
other
yet
as
common
life
in
my
opinion
is
scarcely
worth
having
even
with
a
every
day
and
a
pudding
added
thereunto
i
will
allow
you
to
cultivate
my
judgment
if
you
will
permit
me
to
keep
alive
the
sentiments
in
your
heart
which
may
be
termed
romantic
because
the
offspring
of
the
senses
and
the
imagination
they
resemble
the
mother
more
than
the
father
when
they
produce
the
suffusion
i
in
spite
of
icy
age
i
hope
still
to
see
it
if
you
have
not
determined
only
to
eat
and
drink
and
be
stupidly
useful
to
the
stupid
yours
mary
letter
xxi
august
i
received
both
your
letters
i
had
reckoned
on
hearing
from
you
yesterday
therefore
was
disappointed
though
i
imputed
your
silence
to
the
right
cause
i
intended
answering
your
kind
letter
immediately
that
you
might
have
felt
the
pleasure
it
gave
me
but
came
in
and
some
other
things
interrupted
me
so
that
the
fine
vapour
has
evaporated
yet
leaving
a
sweet
scent
behind
i
have
only
to
tell
you
what
is
sufficiently
obvious
that
the
earnest
desire
i
have
shown
to
keep
my
place
or
gain
more
ground
in
your
heart
is
a
sure
proof
how
necessary
your
affection
is
to
my
still
i
do
not
think
it
false
delicacy
or
foolish
pride
to
wish
that
your
attention
to
my
happiness
should
arise
from
love
which
is
always
rather
a
selfish
passion
as
reason
that
is
i
want
you
to
promote
my
felicity
by
seeking
your
for
whatever
pleasure
it
may
give
me
to
discover
your
generosity
of
soul
i
would
not
be
dependent
for
your
affection
on
the
very
quality
i
most
admire
no
there
are
qualities
in
your
heart
which
demand
my
affection
but
unless
the
attachment
appears
to
me
clearly
mutual
i
shall
labour
only
to
esteem
your
character
instead
of
cherishing
a
tenderness
for
your
person
i
write
in
a
hurry
because
the
little
one
who
has
been
sleeping
a
long
time
begins
to
call
for
me
poor
thing
when
i
am
sad
i
lament
that
all
my
affections
grow
on
me
till
they
become
too
strong
for
my
peace
though
they
all
afford
me
snatches
of
exquisite
enjoyment
this
for
our
little
girl
was
at
first
very
reasonable
more
the
effect
of
reason
a
sense
of
duty
than
feeling
now
she
has
got
into
my
heart
and
imagination
and
when
i
walk
out
without
her
her
little
figure
is
ever
dancing
before
me
you
too
have
somehow
clung
round
my
heart
i
found
i
could
not
eat
my
dinner
in
the
great
room
and
when
i
took
up
the
large
knife
to
carve
for
myself
tears
rushed
into
my
do
not
however
suppose
that
i
am
melancholy
for
when
you
are
from
me
i
not
only
wonder
how
i
can
find
fault
with
you
but
how
i
can
doubt
your
affection
i
will
not
mix
any
comments
on
the
inclosed
it
roused
my
indignation
with
the
effusion
of
tenderness
with
which
i
assure
you
that
you
are
the
friend
of
my
bosom

my

i
want
to
know
what
steps
you
have
taken
respecting
knavery
always
rouses
my
indignation
i
should
be
gratified
to
hear
that
the
law
had
chastised
severely
but
i
do
not
wish
you
to
see
him
because
the
business
does
not
now
admit
of
peaceful
discussion
and
i
do
not
exactly
know
how
you
would
express
your
contempt
pray
ask
some
questions
about

i
am
still
pleased
with
the
dignity
of
his
the
other
day
in
the
cause
of
humanity
he
made
use
of
a
degree
of
address
which
i
admire
and
mean
to
point
out
to
you
as
one
of
the
few
instances
of
address
which
do
credit
to
the
abilities
of
the
man
without
taking
away
from
that
confidence
in
his
openness
of
heart
which
is
the
true
basis
of
both
public
and
private
friendship
do
not
suppose
that
i
mean
to
allude
to
a
little
reserve
of
temper
in
you
of
which
i
have
sometimes
complained
you
have
been
used
to
a
cunning
woman
and
you
almost
look
for
cunning
nay
in
my
happiness
you
now
and
then
wounded
my
sensibility
concealing
yourself
till
honest
sympathy
giving
you
to
me
without
disguise
lets
me
look
into
a
heart
which
my
one
wishes
to
creep
into
to
be
revived
and
you
have
frankness
of
heart
but
not
often
exactly
that
overflowing
de
which
becoming
almost
childish
appears
a
weakness
only
to
the
weak
but
i
have
left
poor
tallien
i
wanted
you
to
enquire
likewise
whether
as
a
member
declared
in
the
convention
robespierre
really
maintained
a
of
should
it
prove
so
i
suspect
that
they
rather
flattered
his
vanity
than
his
senses
here
is
a
chatting
desultory
epistle
but
do
not
suppose
that
i
mean
to
close
it
without
mentioning
the
little
damsel
who
has
been
almost
springing
out
of
my
arm
she
certainly
looks
very
like
you
but
i
do
not
love
her
the
less
for
that
whether
i
am
angry
or
pleased
with
you
yours

this
i
therefore
merely
write
because
i
know
i
should
be
disappointed
at
seeing
any
one
who
had
left
you
if
you
did
not
send
a
letter
were
it
ever
so
short
to
tell
me
why
you
did
not
write
a
longer
and
you
will
want
to
be
told
over
and
over
again
that
our
little
hercules
is
quite
recovered
besides
looking
at
me
there
are
three
other
things
which
delight
her
to
ride
in
a
coach
to
look
at
a
scarlet
waistcoat
and
hear
loud
music
yesterday
at
the
she
enjoyed
the
two
latter
but
to
honour
rousseau
i
intend
to
give
her
a
sash
the
first
she
has
ever
had
round
her
and
why
not
for
i
have
always
been
half
in
love
with
him
well
this
you
will
say
is
trifling
shall
i
talk
about
alum
or
soap
there
is
nothing
picturesque
in
your
present
pursuits
my
imagination
then
rather
chuses
to
ramble
back
to
the
barrier
with
you
or
to
see
you
coming
to
meet
me
and
my
basket
of
with
what
pleasure
do
i
recollect
your
looks
and
words
when
i
have
been
sitting
on
the
window
regarding
the
waving
corn
believe
me
sage
sir
you
have
not
sufficient
respect
for
the
imagination
i
could
prove
to
you
in
a
trice
that
it
is
the
mother
of
sentiment
the
great
distinction
of
our
nature
the
only
purifier
of
the
passions
animals
have
a
portion
of
reason
and
equal
if
not
more
exquisite
senses
but
no
trace
of
imagination
or
her
offspring
taste
appears
in
any
of
their
actions
the
impulse
of
the
senses
passions
if
you
will
and
the
conclusions
of
reason
draw
men
together
but
the
imagination
is
the
true
fire
stolen
from
heaven
to
animate
this
cold
creature
of
clay
producing
all
those
fine
sympathies
that
lead
to
rapture
rendering
men
social
by
expanding
their
hearts
instead
of
leaving
them
leisure
to
calculate
how
many
comforts
society
affords
if
you
call
these
observations
romantic
a
phrase
in
this
place
which
would
be
tantamount
to
nonsensical
i
shall
be
apt
to
retort
that
you
are
embruted
by
trade
and
the
vulgar
enjoyments
of
life
bring
me
then
back
your
or
you
shall
have
nothing
to
say
to
my
and
i
shall
fly
from
you
to
cherish
the
remembrances
that
will
ever
be
dear
to
me
for
i
am
yours

xxiv
paris
evening
i
have
been
playing
and
laughing
with
the
little
girl
so
long
that
i
can
not
take
up
my
pen
to
address
you
without
emotion
pressing
her
to
my
bosom
she
looked
so
like
you
your
best
looks
for
i
do
not
admire
your
commercial
face
every
nerve
seemed
to
vibrate
to
the
touch
and
i
began
to
think
that
there
was
something
in
the
assertion
of
man
and
wife
being
one
for
you
seemed
to
pervade
my
whole
frame
quickening
the
beat
of
my
heart
and
lending
me
the
sympathetic
tears
you
excited
have
i
any
thing
more
to
say
to
you
no
not
for
the
present
the
rest
is
all
flown
away
and
indulging
tenderness
for
you
i
can
not
now
complain
of
some
people
here
who
have
ruffled
my
temper
for
two
or
three
days
past
paris
yesterday
b
sent
to
me
for
my
packet
of
letters
he
called
on
me
before
and
i
like
him
better
than
i
did
that
is
i
have
the
same
opinion
of
his
understanding
but
i
think
with
you
he
has
more
tenderness
and
real
delicacy
of
feeling
with
respect
to
women
than
are
commonly
to
be
met
with
his
manner
too
of
speaking
of
his
little
girl
about
the
age
of
mine
interested
me
i
gave
him
a
letter
for
my
sister
and
requested
him
to
see
her
i
have
been
interrupted
i
suppose
will
write
about
business
public
affairs
i
do
not
descant
on
except
to
tell
you
that
they
write
now
with
great
freedom
and
truth
and
this
liberty
of
the
press
will
overthrow
the
jacobins
i
plainly
perceive
i
hope
you
take
care
of
your
health
i
have
got
a
habit
of
restlessness
at
night
which
arises
i
believe
from
activity
of
mind
for
when
i
am
alone
that
is
not
near
one
to
whom
i
can
open
my
heart
i
sink
into
reveries
and
trains
of
thinking
which
agitate
and
fatigue
me
this
is
my
third
letter
when
am
i
to
hear
from
you
i
need
not
tell
you
i
suppose
that
i
am
now
writing
with
somebody
in
the
room
with
me
and
is
waiting
to
carry
this
to
i
will
then
kiss
the
girl
for
you
and
bid
you
adieu
i
desired
you
in
one
of
my
other
letters
to
bring
back
to
me
your

that
you
should
not
be
loved
by
my

know
that
you
will
love
her
more
and
more
for
she
is
a
little
affectionate
intelligent
creature
with
as
much
vivacity
i
should
think
as
you
could
wish
for
i
was
going
to
tell
you
of
two
or
three
things
which
displease
me
here
but
they
are
not
of
sufficient
consequence
to
interrupt
pleasing
sensations

have
received
a

have
written
to
you
three
or
four

different

have
prevented

forward
them

finding
that

not
arrive

and
believe
you
will
have
set

inclose
it
to
you
and
shall
give
it
in

to

detained
to
whom
i
also
gave
a
letter
i
can
not
help
being
anxious
to
hear
from
you
but
i
shall
not
harrass
you
with
accounts
of
inquietudes
or
of
cares
that
arise
from

had
so
many
little
plagues

lamented

best
a
most
helpless
creature

now
on
account
of
her
pregnancy
more
trouble
than
use
to
me
so
that
i
still
continue
to
be
almost
a
slave
to
the
she
indeed
rewards
me
for
she
is
a
sweet
little
creature
for
setting
aside
a
fondness
which
by
the
bye
is
growing
on
me

a
little

her
eyes

the
eyes
of
a

i
will
swear
i
slept
at

in
the
very
room
if
you
have
not
forgot
in
which
you
pressed
me
very
tenderly
to
your
i
did
not
forget
to
fold
my
darling

sensations
that
are
almost

sacred

letters

want

letter
xxvi
paris
october
it
is
a
heartless
task
to
write
letters
without
knowing
whether
they
will
ever
reach
i
have
given
two
to
who
has
been
every
day
for
a
week
past
and
three
others
which
were
written
in
a
strain
a
little
querulous
or
so
i
have
not
been
able
to
forward
by
the
opportunities
that
were
mentioned
to
me
mieux
you
will
say
and
i
will
not
say
nay
for
i
should
be
sorry
that
the
contents
of
a
letter
when
you
are
so
far
away
should
damp
the
pleasure
that
the
sight
of
it
would
afford
judging
of
your
feelings
by
my
own
i
just
now
stumbled
on
one
of
the
kind
letters
which
you
wrote
during
your
last
absence
you
are
then
a
dear
affectionate
creature
and
i
will
not
plague
you
the
letter
which
you
chance
to
receive
when
the
absence
is
so
long
ought
to
bring
only
tears
of
tenderness
without
any
bitter
alloy
into
your
eyes
after
your
return
i
hope
indeed
that
you
will
not
be
so
immersed
in
business
as
during
the
last
three
or
four
months
past
for
even
money
taking
into
the
account
all
the
future
comforts
it
is
to
procure
may
be
gained
at
too
dear
a
rate
if
painful
impressions
are
left
on
the
these
impressions
were
much
more
lively
soon
after
you
went
away
than
at
present
for
a
thousand
tender
recollections
efface
the
melancholy
traces
they
left
on
my
mind
and
every
emotion
is
on
the
same
side
as
my
reason
which
always
was
on
separated
it
would
be
almost
impious
to
dwell
on
real
or
imaginary
imperfections
of
i
feel
that
i
love
you
and
if
i
can
not
be
happy
with
you
i
will
seek
it
no
where
else
my
little
darling
grows
every
day
more
dear
to
me
and
she
often
has
a
kiss
when
we
are
alone
together
which
i
give
her
for
you
with
all
my
heart
i
have
been
interrupted
and
must
send
off
my
letter
the
liberty
of

produce
a
great
effect

the
of

will
not
be

more
monsters
will
perish

the

are
yet

almost
fear
the
last
flap
of
the
tail
of
the

i
have
had
several
trifling
teazing
inconveniences
here
which
i
shall
not
now
trouble
you

detail
i

is
better
for

with
you

still
here
he
is
a
lost
he
really
loves
his
wife
and
is
anxious
about
his
children
but
his
indiscriminate
hospitality
and
social
feelings
have
given
him
an
inveterate
habit
of
drinking
that
destroys
his
health
as
well
as
renders
his

if
his

letter
xxvii
paris
october
my
dear
love
i
began
to
wish
so
earnestly
to
hear
from
you
that
the
sight
of
your
letters
occasioned
such
pleasurable
emotions
i
was
obliged
to
throw
them
aside
till
the
little
girl
and
i
were
alone
together
and
this
said
little
girl
our
darling
is
become
a
most
intelligent
little
creature
and
as
gay
as
a
lark
and
that
in
the
morning
too
which
i
do
not
find
quite
so
convenient
i
once
told
you
that
the
sensations
before
she
was
born
and
when
she
is
sucking
were
pleasant
but
they
do
not
deserve
to
be
compared
to
the
emotions
i
feel
when
she
stops
to
smile
upon
me
or
laughs
outright
on
meeting
me
unexpectedly
in
the
street
or
after
a
short
absence
she
has
now
the
advantage
of
having
two
good
nurses
and
i
am
at
present
able
to
discharge
my
duty
to
her
without
being
the
slave
of
it
i
have
therefore
employed
and
amused
myself
since
i
got
rid
of
and
am
making
a
progress
in
the
language
amongst
other
things
i
have
also
made
some
new
acquaintance
i
have
almost
a
judge
of
the
tribunal
r
who
though
i
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
has
humanity
if
not
but
let
me
tell
you
if
you
do
not
make
haste
back
i
shall
be
half
in
love
with
the
author
of
the
who
is
a
handsome
man
a
little
too
or
so
and
plays
sweetly
on
the
violin
what
do
you
say
to
this
threat
why
i
like
to
give
way
to
a
sprightly
vein
when
writing
to
you
that
is
when
i
am
pleased
with
you
the
devil
you
know
is
proverbially
said
to
be
in
a
good
humour
when
he
is
pleased
will
you
not
then
be
a
good
boy
and
come
back
quickly
to
play
with
your
girls
but
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
love
the
best
my
heart
longs
for
your
return
my
love
and
only
looks
for
and
seeks
happiness
with
you
yet
do
not
imagine
that
i
childishly
wish
you
to
come
back
before
you
have
arranged
things
in
such
a
manner
that
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
you
to
leave
us
soon
again
or
to
make
exertions
which
injure
your
constitution

paris
i
have
been
my
love
for
some
days
tormented
by
fears
that
i
would
not
allow
to
assume
a
form
i
had
been
expecting
you
daily
and
i
heard
that
many
vessels
had
been
driven
on
shore
during
the
late
well
i
now
see
your
letter
and
find
that
you
are
safe
i
will
not
regret
then
that
your
exertions
have
hitherto
been
so
unavailing
be
that
as
it
may
return
to
me
when
you
have
arranged
the
other
matters
which
has
been
crowding
on
you
i
want
to
be
sure
that
you
are
safe
and
not
separated
from
me
by
a
sea
that
must
be
passed
for
feeling
that
i
am
happier
than
i
ever
was
do
you
wonder
at
my
sometimes
dreading
that
fate
has
not
done
persecuting
me
come
to
me
my
dearest
friend
husband
father
of
my
child
all
these
fond
ties
glow
at
my
heart
at
this
moment
and
dim
my
with
you
an
independence
is
desirable
and
it
is
always
within
our
reach
if
affluence
escapes
us
without
you
the
world
again
appears
empty
to
me
but
i
am
recurring
to
some
of
the
melancholy
thoughts
that
have
flitted
across
my
mind
for
some
days
past
and
haunted
my
dreams
my
little
darling
is
indeed
a
sweet
child
and
i
am
sorry
that
you
are
not
here
to
see
her
little
mind
unfold
itself
you
talk
of
dalliance
but
certainly
no
lover
was
ever
more
attached
to
his
mistress
than
she
is
to
me
her
eyes
follow
me
every
where
and
by
affection
i
have
the
most
despotic
power
over
her
she
is
all
vivacity
or
softness
yes
i
love
her
more
than
i
thought
i
should
when
i
have
been
hurt
at
your
stay
i
have
embraced
her
as
my
only
comfort
when
pleased
with
you
for
looking
and
laughing
like
you
nay
i
can
not
i
find
long
be
angry
with
you
whilst
i
am
kissing
her
for
resembling
you
but
there
would
be
no
end
to
these
details
fold
us
both
to
your
heart
for
i
am
truly
and
affectionately

i
do
my
love
indeed
sincerely
sympathize
with
you
in
all
your
yet
knowing
that
you
are
well
and
think
of
me
with
affection
i
only
lament
other
disappointments
because
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
thus
exert
yourself
in
vain
and
that
you
are
kept
from
me
i
know
urges
you
to
stay
and
is
continually
branching
out
into
new
projects
because
he
has
the
idle
desire
to
amass
a
large
fortune
rather
an
immense
one
merely
to
have
the
credit
of
having
made
it
but
we
who
are
governed
by
other
motives
ought
not
to
be
led
on
by
him
when
we
meet
we
will
discuss
this
subject
you
will
listen
to
reason
and
it
has
probably
occurred
to
you
that
it
will
be
better
in
future
to
pursue
some
sober
plan
which
may
demand
more
time
and
still
enable
you
to
arrive
at
the
same
end
it
appears
to
me
absurd
to
waste
life
in
preparing
to
live
would
it
not
now
be
possible
to
arrange
your
business
in
such
a
manner
as
to
avoid
the
inquietudes
of
which
i
have
had
my
share
since
your
departure
is
it
not
possible
to
enter
into
business
as
an
employment
necessary
to
keep
the
faculties
awake
and
to
sink
a
little
in
the
expressions
the
pot
boiling
without
suffering
what
must
ever
be
considered
as
a
secondary
object
to
engross
the
mind
and
drive
sentiment
and
affection
out
of
the
heart
i
am
in
a
hurry
to
give
this
letter
to
the
person
who
has
promised
to
forward
it
with
i
wish
then
to
counteract
in
some
measure
what
he
has
doubtless
recommended
most
warmly
stay
my
friend
whilst
it
is
i
will
give
you
no
tenderer
name
though
it
glows
at
my
heart
unless
you
come
the
moment
the
settling
the
objects
do
not
to
your
taking
any
other
journey
or
the
little
woman
and
i
will
be
off
the
lord
knows
where
but
as
i
had
rather
owe
every
thing
to
your
affection
and
i
may
add
to
your
reason
for
this
immoderate
desire
of
wealth
which
makes
so
eager
to
have
you
remain
is
contrary
to
your
principles
of
action
i
will
not
importune
i
will
only
tell
you
that
i
long
to
see
you
and
being
at
peace
with
you
i
shall
be
hurt
rather
than
made
angry
by
having
suffered
so
much
in
life
do
not
be
surprised
if
i
sometimes
when
left
to
myself
grow
gloomy
and
suppose
that
it
was
all
a
dream
and
that
my
happiness
is
not
to
last
i
say
happiness
because
remembrance
retrenches
all
the
dark
shades
of
the
picture
my
little
one
begins
to
show
her
teeth
and
use
her
legs
she
wants
you
to
bear
your
part
in
the
nursing
business
for
i
am
fatigued
with
dancing
her
and
yet
she
is
not
satisfied
she
wants
you
to
thank
her
mother
for
taking
such
care
of
her
as
you
only
can
yours
truly

though
i
suppose
you
have
later
intelligence
yet
as
has
just
informed
me
that
he
has
an
opportunity
of
sending
immediately
to
you
i
take
advantage
of
it
to
inclose
you
how
i
hate
this
crooked
business
this
intercourse
with
the
world
which
obliges
one
to
see
the
worst
side
of
human
nature
why
can
not
you
be
content
with
the
object
you
had
first
in
view
when
you
entered
into
this
wearisome
labyrinth
i
know
very
well
that
you
have
imperceptibly
been
drawn
on
yet
why
does
one
project
successful
or
abortive
only
give
place
to
two
others
is
it
not
sufficient
to
avoid
poverty
i
am
contented
to
do
my
part
and
even
here
sufficient
to
escape
from
wretchedness
is
not
difficult
to
obtain
and
let
me
tell
you
i
have
my
project
also
and
if
you
do
not
soon
return
the
little
girl
and
i
will
take
care
of
ourselves
we
will
not
accept
any
of
your
cold
kindness
your
distant
civilities
no
not
we
this
is
but
half
jesting
for
i
am
really
tormented
by
the
desire
which
manifests
to
have
you
remain
where
you
yet
why
do
i
talk
to
you
if
he
can
persuade
you
let
him
for
if
you
are
not
happier
with
me
and
your
own
wishes
do
not
make
you
throw
aside
these
eternal
projects
i
am
above
using
any
arguments
though
reason
as
well
as
affection
seems
to
offer
them
if
our
affection
be
mutual
they
will
occur
to
you
and
you
will
act
accordingly
since
my
arrival
here
i
have
found
the
german
lady
of
whom
you
have
heard
me
speak
her
first
child
died
in
the
month
but
she
has
another
about
the
age
of
my
fanny
a
fine
little
creature
they
are
still
but
contriving
to
live
earning
their
daily
bread
yet
though
they
are
but
just
above
poverty
i
envy
she
is
a
tender
affectionate
mother
fatigued
even
by
her
however
she
has
an
affectionate
husband
in
her
turn
to
render
her
care
light
and
to
share
her
pleasure
i
will
own
to
you
that
feeling
extreme
tenderness
for
my
little
girl
i
grow
sad
very
often
when
i
am
playing
with
her
that
you
are
not
here
to
observe
with
me
how
her
mind
unfolds
and
her
little
heart
becomes
attached
these
appear
to
me
to
be
true
pleasures
and
still
you
suffer
them
to
escape
you
in
search
of
what
we
may
never
it
is
your
own
maxim
to
live
in
the
present
moment
you
stay
for
god
sake
but
tell
me
the
truth
if
not
tell
me
when
i
may
expect
to
see
you
and
let
me
not
be
always
vainly
looking
for
you
till
i
grow
sick
at
heart
adieu

must
take
my
darling

should
you
receive
three
or
four
of
the
letters
at
once
which
i
have
written
lately
do
not
think
of
sir
john
brute
for
i
do
not
mean
to
wife
you
i
only
take
advantage
of
every
occasion
that
one
out
of
three
of
my
epistles
may
reach
your
hands
and
inform
you
that
i
am
not
of
opinion
who
talks
till
he
makes
me
angry
of
the
necessity
of
your
staying
two
or
three
months
longer
i
do
not
like
this
life
of
continual
inquietude
and
i
am
determined
to
try
to
earn
some
money
here
myself
in
order
to
convince
you
that
if
you
chuse
to
run
about
the
world
to
get
a
fortune
it
is
for
yourself
for
the
little
girl
and
i
will
live
without
your
assistance
unless
you
are
with
us
i
may
be
termed
proud
be
it
so
but
i
will
never
abandon
certain
principles
of
action
the
common
run
of
men
have
such
an
ignoble
way
of
thinking
that
if
they
debauch
their
hearts
and
prostitute
their
persons
following
perhaps
a
gust
of
inebriation
they
suppose
the
wife
slave
rather
whom
they
maintain
has
no
right
to
complain
and
ought
to
receive
the
sultan
whenever
he
deigns
to
return
with
open
arms
though
his
have
been
polluted
by
half
an
hundred
promiscuous
amours
during
his
absence
i
consider
fidelity
and
constancy
as
two
distinct
things
yet
the
former
is
necessary
to
give
life
to
the
other
and
such
a
degree
of
respect
do
i
think
due
to
myself
that
if
only
probity
which
is
a
good
thing
in
its
place
brings
you
back
never
return
for
if
a
wandering
of
the
heart
or
even
a
caprice
of
the
imagination
detains
you
there
is
an
end
of
all
my
hopes
of
happiness
i
could
not
forgive
it
if
i
would
i
have
gotten
into
a
melancholy
mood
you
perceive
you
know
my
opinion
of
men
in
general
you
know
that
i
think
them
systematic
tyrants
and
that
it
is
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
to
meet
with
a
man
with
sufficient
delicacy
of
feeling
to
govern
desire
when
i
am
thus
sad
i
lament
that
my
little
darling
fondly
as
i
doat
on
her
is
a
i
am
sorry
to
have
a
tie
to
a
world
that
for
me
is
ever
sown
with
thorns
you
will
call
this
an
letter
when
in
fact
it
is
the
strongest
proof
of
affection
i
can
give
to
dread
to
lose
you
has
taken
such
pains
to
convince
me
that
you
must
and
ought
to
stay
that
it
has
inconceivably
depressed
my
spirits
you
have
always
known
my
opinion
i
have
ever
declared
that
two
people
who
mean
to
live
together
ought
not
to
be
long
if
certain
things
are
more
necessary
to
you
than
me
search
for
them
say
but
one
word
and
you
shall
never
hear
of
me
if
not
for
god
sake
let
us
struggle
with
poverty
with
any
evil
but
these
continual
inquietudes
of
business
which
i
have
been
told
were
to
last
but
a
few
months
though
every
day
the
end
appears
more
distant
this
is
the
first
letter
in
this
strain
that
i
have
determined
to
forward
to
you
the
rest
lie
by
because
i
was
unwilling
to
give
you
pain
and
i
should
not
now
write
if
i
did
not
think
that
there
would
be
no
conclusion
to
the
schemes
which
demand
as
i
am
told
your
presence
mary
letter
xxxii
paris
january
i
just
now
received
one
of
your
hasty
for
business
so
entirely
occupies
you
that
you
have
not
time
or
sufficient
command
of
thought
to
write
letters
beware
you
seem
to
be
got
into
a
whirl
of
projects
and
schemes
which
are
drawing
you
into
a
gulph
that
if
it
do
not
absorb
your
happiness
will
infallibly
destroy
mine
fatigued
during
my
youth
by
the
most
arduous
struggles
not
only
to
obtain
independence
but
to
render
myself
useful
not
merely
pleasure
for
which
i
had
the
most
lively
taste
i
mean
the
simple
pleasures
that
flow
from
passion
and
affection
escaped
me
but
the
most
melancholy
views
of
life
were
impressed
by
a
disappointed
heart
on
my
mind
since
i
knew
you
i
have
been
endeavouring
to
go
back
to
my
former
nature
and
have
allowed
some
time
to
glide
away
winged
with
the
delight
which
only
spontaneous
enjoyment
can
why
have
you
so
soon
dissolved
the
charm
i
am
really
unable
to
bear
the
continual
inquietude
which
your
and
plans
produce
this
you
may
term
want
of
firmness
but
you
are
mistaken
i
have
still
sufficient
firmness
to
pursue
my
principle
of
action
the
present
misery
i
can
not
find
a
softer
word
to
do
justice
to
my
feelings
appears
to
me
unnecessary
and
therefore
i
have
not
firmness
to
support
it
as
you
may
think
i
ought
i
should
have
been
content
and
still
wish
to
retire
with
you
to
a
farm
my
god
any
thing
but
these
continual
anxieties
any
thing
but
commerce
which
debases
the
mind
and
roots
out
affection
from
the
heart
i
do
not
mean
to
complain
of
subordinate
inconveniences
yet
i
will
simply
observe
that
led
to
expect
you
every
week
i
did
not
make
the
arrangements
required
by
the
present
circumstances
to
procure
the
necessaries
of
life
in
order
to
have
them
a
servant
for
that
purpose
only
is
indispensible
the
want
of
wood
has
made
me
catch
the
most
violent
cold
i
ever
had
and
my
head
is
so
disturbed
by
continual
coughing
that
i
am
unable
to
write
without
stopping
frequently
to
recollect
this
however
is
one
of
the
common
evils
which
must
be
borne
with
bodily
pain
does
not
touch
the
heart
though
it
fatigues
the
spirits
still
as
you
talk
of
your
return
even
in
february
doubtingly
i
have
determined
the
moment
the
weather
changes
to
wean
my
it
is
too
soon
for
her
to
begin
to
divide
sorrow
and
as
one
has
well
said
despair
is
a
freeman
we
will
go
and
seek
our
fortune
together
this
is
not
a
caprice
of
the
moment
for
your
absence
has
given
new
weight
to
some
conclusions
that
i
was
very
reluctantly
forming
before
you
left
i
do
not
chuse
to
be
a
secondary
if
your
feelings
were
in
unison
with
mine
you
would
not
sacrifice
so
much
to
visionary
prospects
of
future
advantage

i
was
just
going
to
begin
my
letter
with
the
fag
end
of
a
song
which
would
only
have
told
you
what
i
may
as
well
say
simply
that
it
is
pleasant
to
forgive
those
we
love
i
have
received
your
two
letters
dated
the
and
of
december
and
my
anger
died
away
you
can
scarcely
conceive
the
effect
some
of
your
letters
have
produced
on
me
after
longing
to
hear
from
you
during
a
tedious
interval
of
suspense
i
have
seen
a
superscription
written
by
promising
myself
pleasure
and
feeling
emotion
i
have
laid
it
by
me
till
the
person
who
brought
it
left
the
room
when
behold
on
opening
it
i
have
found
only
half
a
dozen
hasty
lines
that
have
damped
all
the
rising
affection
of
my
soul
well
now
for
business
my
animal
is
well
i
have
not
yet
taught
her
to
eat
but
nature
is
doing
the
business
i
gave
her
a
crust
to
assist
the
cutting
of
her
teeth
and
now
she
has
two
she
makes
good
use
of
them
to
gnaw
a
crust
biscuit
you
would
laugh
to
see
her
she
is
just
like
a
little
squirrel
she
will
guard
a
crust
for
two
hours
and
after
fixing
her
eye
on
an
object
for
some
time
dart
on
it
with
an
aim
as
sure
as
a
bird
of
prey
nothing
can
equal
her
life
and
spirits
i
suffer
from
a
cold
but
it
does
not
affect
her
adieu
do
not
forget
to
love
us
and
come
soon
to
tell
us
that
you
do
mary
letter
xxxiv
paris
from
the
purport
of
your
last
letters
i
should
suppose
that
this
will
scarcely
reach
you
and
i
have
already
written
so
many
letters
that
you
have
either
not
received
or
neglected
to
acknowledge
i
do
not
find
it
pleasant
or
rather
i
have
no
inclination
to
go
over
the
same
ground
again
if
you
have
received
them
and
are
still
detained
by
new
projects
it
is
useless
for
me
to
say
any
more
on
the
subject
i
have
done
with
it
for
ever
yet
i
ought
to
remind
you
that
your
pecuniary
interest
suffers
by
your
absence
for
my
part
my
head
is
turned
giddy
by
only
hearing
of
plans
to
make
money
and
my
contemptuous
feelings
have
sometimes
burst
out
i
therefore
was
glad
that
a
violent
cold
gave
me
a
pretext
to
stay
at
home
lest
i
should
have
uttered
unseasonable
truths
my
child
is
well
and
the
spring
will
perhaps
restore
me
to
i
have
endured
many
inconveniences
this
winter
which
should
i
be
ashamed
to
mention
if
they
had
been
unavoidable
the
secondary
pleasures
of
life
you
say
are
very
necessary
to
my
comfort
it
may
be
so
but
i
have
ever
considered
them
as
secondary
if
therefore
you
accuse
me
of
wanting
the
resolution
necessary
to
bear
the
evils
of
life
i
should
answer
that
i
have
not
fashioned
my
mind
to
sustain
them
because
i
would
avoid
them

what
it
would
adieu
mary
letter
xxxv
paris
february
the
melancholy
presentiment
has
for
some
time
hung
on
my
spirits
that
we
were
parted
for
ever
and
the
letters
i
received
this
day
by
convince
me
that
it
was
not
without
foundation
you
allude
to
some
other
letters
which
i
suppose
have
miscarried
for
most
of
those
i
have
got
were
only
a
few
hasty
lines
calculated
to
wound
the
tenderness
the
sight
of
the
superscriptions
excited
i
mean
not
however
to
complain
yet
so
many
feelings
are
struggling
for
utterance
and
agitating
a
heart
almost
bursting
with
anguish
that
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
write
with
any
degree
of
coherence
you
left
me
indisposed
though
you
have
taken
no
notice
of
it
and
the
most
fatiguing
journey
i
ever
had
contributed
to
continue
it
however
i
recovered
my
health
but
a
neglected
cold
and
continual
inquietude
during
the
last
two
months
have
reduced
me
to
a
state
of
weakness
i
never
before
experienced
those
who
did
not
know
that
the
was
at
work
at
the
core
cautioned
me
about
suckling
my
child
too
god
preserve
this
poor
child
and
render
her
happier
than
her
mother
but
i
am
wandering
from
my
subject
indeed
my
head
turns
giddy
when
i
think
that
all
the
confidence
i
have
had
in
the
affection
of
others
is
come
to
i
did
not
expect
this
blow
from
you
i
have
done
my
duty
to
you
and
my
child
and
if
i
am
not
to
have
any
return
of
affection
to
reward
me
i
have
the
sad
consolation
of
knowing
that
i
deserved
a
better
fate
my
soul
is
weary
i
am
sick
at
heart
and
but
for
this
little
darling
i
would
cease
to
care
about
a
life
which
is
now
stripped
of
every
charm
you
see
how
stupid
i
am
uttering
declamation
when
i
meant
simply
to
tell
you
that
i
consider
your
requesting
me
to
come
to
you
as
merely
dictated
by
indeed
i
scarcely
understand
you
request
me
to
come
and
then
tell
me
that
you
have
not
given
up
all
thoughts
of
returning
to
this
place
when
i
determined
to
live
with
you
i
was
only
governed
by
i
would
share
poverty
with
you
but
i
turn
with
affright
from
the
sea
of
trouble
on
which
you
are
i
have
certain
principles
of
action
i
know
what
i
look
for
to
found
my
happiness
it
is
not
with
you
i
wished
for
sufficient
to
procure
the
comforts
of
life
as
it
is
less
will
i
can
still
exert
myself
to
obtain
the
necessaries
of
life
for
my
child
and
she
does
not
want
more
at
i
have
two
or
three
plans
in
my
head
to
earn
our
subsistence
for
do
not
suppose
that
neglected
by
you
i
will
lie
under
obligations
of
a
pecuniary
kind
to
you
no
i
would
sooner
submit
to
menial
i
wanted
the
support
of
your
affection
that
gone
all
is
over
i
did
not
think
when
i
complained
of
contemptible
avidity
to
accumulate
money
that
he
would
have
dragged
you
into
his
schemes
i
can
not
i
inclose
a
fragment
of
a
letter
written
soon
after
your
departure
and
another
which
tenderness
made
me
keep
back
when
it
was
you
will
see
then
the
sentiments
of
a
calmer
though
not
a
more
determined
do
not
insult
me
by
saying
that
our
being
together
is
paramount
to
every
other
consideration
were
it
you
would
not
be
running
after
a
bubble
at
the
expence
of
my
peace
of
mind
perhaps
this
is
the
last
letter
you
will
ever
receive
from
me
mary
letter
xxxvi
paris
you
talk
of
permanent
views
and
future
comfort
not
for
me
for
i
am
dead
to
hope
the
inquietudes
of
the
last
winter
have
finished
the
business
and
my
heart
is
not
only
broken
but
my
constitution
destroyed
i
conceive
myself
in
a
galloping
consumption
and
the
continual
anxiety
i
feel
at
the
thought
of
leaving
my
child
feeds
the
fever
that
nightly
devours
me
it
is
on
her
account
that
i
again
write
to
you
to
conjure
you
by
all
that
you
hold
sacred
to
leave
her
here
with
the
german
lady
you
may
have
heard
me
mention
she
has
a
child
of
the
same
age
and
they
may
be
brought
up
together
as
i
wish
her
to
be
brought
up
i
shall
write
more
fully
on
the
subject
to
facilitate
this
i
shall
give
up
my
present
lodgings
and
go
into
the
same
house
i
can
live
much
cheaper
there
which
is
now
become
an
object
i
have
had
livres
from
and
i
shall
take
one
more
to
pay
my
servant
wages
and
then
i
shall
endeavour
to
procure
what
i
want
by
my
own
exertions
i
shall
entirely
give
up
the
acquaintance
of
the
americans
and
i
have
not
been
on
good
terms
a
long
time
yesterday
he
very
unmanlily
exulted
over
me
on
account
of
your
determination
to
stay
i
had
provoked
it
it
is
true
by
some
asperities
against
commerce
which
have
dropped
from
me
when
we
have
argued
about
the
propriety
of
your
remaining
where
you
are
and
it
is
no
matter
i
have
drunk
too
deep
of
the
bitter
cup
to
care
about
trifles
when
you
first
entered
into
these
plans
you
bounded
your
views
to
the
gaining
of
a
thousand
pounds
it
was
sufficient
to
have
procured
a
farm
in
america
which
would
have
been
an
independence
you
find
now
that
you
did
not
know
yourself
and
that
a
certain
situation
in
life
is
more
necessary
to
you
than
you
imagined
more
necessary
than
an
uncorrupted
heart
for
a
year
or
two
you
may
procure
yourself
what
you
call
pleasure
eating
drinking
and
women
but
in
the
solitude
of
declining
life
i
shall
be
remembered
with
regret
i
was
going
to
say
with
remorse
but
checked
my
pen
as
i
have
never
concealed
the
nature
of
my
connection
with
you
your
reputation
will
not
suffer
i
shall
never
have
a
confident
i
am
content
with
the
approbation
of
my
own
mind
and
if
there
be
a
searcher
of
hearts
mine
will
not
be
despised
reading
what
you
have
written
relative
to
the
desertion
of
women
i
have
often
wondered
how
theory
and
practice
could
be
so
different
till
i
recollected
that
the
sentiments
of
passion
and
the
resolves
of
reason
are
very
distinct
as
to
my
sisters
as
you
are
so
continually
hurried
with
business
you
need
not
write
to
them
i
shall
when
my
mind
is
calmer
god
bless
you
adieu
mary
this
has
been
such
a
period
of
barbarity
and
misery
i
ought
not
to
complain
of
having
my
share
i
wish
one
moment
that
i
had
never
heard
of
the
cruelties
that
have
been
practised
here
and
the
next
envy
the
mothers
who
have
been
killed
with
their
children
surely
i
had
suffered
enough
in
life
not
to
be
cursed
with
a
fondness
that
burns
up
the
vital
stream
i
am
imparting
you
will
think
me
mad
i
would
i
were
so
that
i
could
forget
my
misery
so
that
my
head
or
heart
would
be
letter
xxxvii
paris
when
i
first
received
your
letter
putting
off
your
return
to
an
indefinite
time
i
felt
so
hurt
that
i
know
not
what
i
wrote
i
am
now
calmer
though
it
was
not
the
kind
of
wound
over
which
time
has
the
quickest
effect
on
the
contrary
the
more
i
think
the
sadder
i
grow
society
fatigues
me
inexpressibly
so
much
so
that
finding
fault
with
every
one
i
have
only
reason
enough
to
discover
that
the
fault
is
in
myself
my
child
alone
interests
me
and
but
for
her
i
should
not
take
any
pains
to
recover
my
health
as
it
is
i
shall
wean
her
and
try
if
by
that
step
to
which
i
feel
a
repugnance
for
it
is
my
only
solace
i
can
get
rid
of
my
cough
physicians
talk
much
of
the
danger
attending
any
complaint
on
the
lungs
after
a
woman
has
suckled
for
some
months
they
lay
a
stress
also
on
the
necessity
of
keeping
the
mind
tranquil
and
my
god
how
has
mine
be
harrassed
but
whilst
the
caprices
of
other
women
are
gratified
the
wind
of
heaven
not
suffered
to
visit
them
too
rudely
i
have
not
found
a
guardian
angel
in
heaven
or
on
earth
to
ward
off
sorrow
or
care
from
my
bosom
what
sacrifices
have
you
not
made
for
a
woman
you
did
not
respect
but
i
will
not
go
over
this
ground
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
do
not
understand
you
you
say
that
you
have
not
given
up
all
thoughts
of
returning
here
and
i
know
that
it
will
be
necessary
nay
is
i
can
not
explain
myself
but
if
you
have
not
lost
your
memory
you
will
easily
divine
my
meaning
what
is
our
life
then
only
to
be
made
up
of
separations
and
am
i
only
to
return
to
a
country
that
has
not
merely
lost
all
charms
for
me
but
for
which
i
feel
a
repugnance
that
almost
amounts
to
horror
only
to
be
left
there
a
prey
to
it
why
is
it
so
necessary
that
i
should
return
brought
up
here
my
girl
would
be
freer
indeed
expecting
you
to
join
us
i
had
formed
some
plans
of
usefulness
that
have
now
vanished
with
my
hopes
of
happiness
in
the
bitterness
of
my
heart
i
could
complain
with
reason
that
i
am
left
here
dependent
on
a
man
whose
avidity
to
acquire
a
fortune
has
rendered
him
callous
to
every
sentiment
connected
with
social
or
affectionate
with
a
brutal
insensibility
he
can
not
help
displaying
the
pleasure
your
determination
to
stay
gives
him
in
spite
of
the
effect
it
is
visible
it
has
had
on
me
till
i
can
earn
money
i
shall
endeavour
to
borrow
some
for
i
want
to
avoid
asking
him
continually
for
the
sum
necessary
to
maintain
do
not
mistake
me
i
have
never
been
yet
i
have
gone
half
a
dozen
times
to
the
house
to
ask
for
it
and
come
away
without
speaking
you
must
guess
why
besides
i
wish
to
avoid
hearing
of
the
eternal
projects
to
which
you
have
sacrificed
my
peace
not
remembering
but
i
will
be
silent
for
letter
xxxviii
havre
april
here
i
am
at
havre
on
the
wing
towards
you
and
i
write
now
only
to
tell
you
that
you
may
expect
me
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
days
for
i
shall
not
attempt
to
give
vent
to
the
different
emotions
which
agitate
my
heart
you
may
term
a
feeling
which
appears
to
me
to
be
a
degree
of
delicacy
that
naturally
arises
from
sensibility
pride
still
i
can
not
indulge
the
very
affectionate
tenderness
which
glows
in
my
bosom
without
trembling
till
i
see
by
your
eyes
that
it
is
mutual
i
sit
lost
in
thought
looking
at
the
sea
and
tears
rush
into
my
eyes
when
i
find
that
i
am
cherishing
any
fond
i
have
indeed
been
so
unhappy
this
winter
i
find
it
as
difficult
to
acquire
fresh
hopes
as
to
regain
enough
of
this
lie
still
foolish
heart
but
for
the
little
girl
i
could
almost
wish
that
it
should
cease
to
beat
to
be
no
more
alive
to
the
anguish
of
disappointment
sweet
little
creature
i
deprived
myself
of
my
only
pleasure
when
i
weaned
her
about
ten
days
i
am
however
glad
i
conquered
my
it
was
necessary
it
should
be
done
soon
and
i
did
not
wish
to
embitter
the
renewal
of
your
acquaintance
with
her
by
putting
it
off
till
we
it
was
a
painful
exertion
to
me
and
i
thought
it
best
to
throw
this
inquietude
with
the
rest
into
the
sack
that
i
would
fain
throw
over
my
i
wished
to
endure
it
alone
in
short
yet
after
sending
her
to
sleep
in
the
next
room
for
three
or
four
nights
you
can
not
think
with
what
joy
i
took
her
back
again
to
sleep
in
my
bosom
i
suppose
i
shall
find
you
when
i
arrive
for
i
do
not
see
any
necessity
for
your
coming
to
pray
inform
that
i
have
his
little
friend
with
my
wishing
to
oblige
him
made
me
put
myself
to
some
inconvenience
and
delay
my
departure
which
was
irksome
to
me
who
have
not
quite
as
much
philosophy
i
would
not
for
the
world
say
indifference
as
you
god
bless
you

brought

me
little
friend
and
a
girl
whom
i
like
to
take
care
of
our
little
darling
not
on
the
way
for
that
fell
to
my
but
why
do
i
write
about
trifles

any

letter
xl
charlotte
street
rathbone
place
london
friday
may
i
have
just
received
your
affectionate
letter
and
am
distressed
to
think
that
i
have
added
to
your
embarrassments
at
this
troublesome
juncture
when
the
exertion
of
all
the
faculties
of
your
mind
appears
to
be
necessary
to
extricate
you
out
of
your
pecuniary
difficulties
i
suppose
it
was
something
relative
to
the
circumstance
you
have
mentioned
which
made
request
to
see
me
to
about
a
matter
of
great
be
that
as
it
may
his
letter
such
is
the
state
of
my
spirits
inconceivably
alarmed
me
and
rendered
the
last
night
as
distressing
as
the
two
former
had
been
i
have
laboured
to
calm
my
mind
since
you
left
me
still
i
find
that
tranquillity
is
not
to
be
obtained
by
exertion
it
is
a
feeling
so
different
from
the
resignation
of
despair
i
am
however
no
longer
angry
with
you
nor
will
i
ever
utter
another
complaint
there
are
arguments
which
convince
the
reason
whilst
they
carry
death
to
the
we
have
had
too
many
cruel
explanations
that
not
only
cloud
every
future
prospect
but
embitter
the
remembrances
which
alone
give
life
to
let
the
subject
never
be
revived
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
not
only
lost
the
hope
but
the
power
of
being
every
emotion
is
now
sharpened
by
my
soul
has
been
shook
and
my
tone
of
feelings
i
have
gone
out
and
sought
for
dissipation
if
not
amusement
merely
to
fatigue
still
more
i
find
my
irritable
nerves
my
friend
my
dear
friend
examine
yourself
well
i
am
out
of
the
question
for
alas
i
am
nothing
and
discover
what
you
wish
to
do
what
will
render
you
most
comfortable
or
to
be
more
explicit
whether
you
desire
to
live
with
me
or
part
for
ever
when
you
can
once
ascertain
it
tell
me
frankly
i
conjure
you
for
believe
me
i
have
very
involuntarily
interrupted
your
peace
i
shall
expect
you
to
dinner
on
monday
and
will
endeavour
to
assume
a
cheerful
face
to
greet
you
at
any
rate
i
will
avoid
conversations
which
only
tend
to
harrass
your
feelings
because
i
am
most
affectionately
yours

the
letter

you
desired
me
to
forward
and
i
am
tempted
very
laconically
to
wish
you
a
good
morning
not
because
i
am
angry
or
have
nothing
to
say
but
to
keep
down
a
wounded
i
shall
make
every
effort
to
calm
my
mind
yet
a
strong
conviction
seems
to
whirl
round
in
the
very
centre
of
my
brain
which
like
the
fiat
of
fate
emphatically
assures
me
that
grief
has
a
firm
hold
of
my

dropping

it

those
tender

round
the

of
home
which
even
now
dim
my

every

dated
the
which
i
suppose
was
a
mistake
for
it
could
scarcely
have
loitered
so
long
on
the
road
the
general
observations
which
apply
to
the
state
of
your
own

appear
to
me
just
as
far
as
they
go
and
i
shall
always
consider
it
as
one
of
the
most
serious
misfortunes
of
my
life
that
i
did
not
meet
you
before
satiety
had
rendered
your
senses
so
fastidious
as
almost
to
close
up
every
tender
avenue
of
sentiment
and
affection
that
leads
to
your
sympathetic
heart
you
have
a
heart
my
friend
yet
hurried
away
by
the
impetuosity
of
inferior
feelings
you
have
sought
in
vulgar
excesses
for
that
gratification
which
only
the
heart
can
bestow
the
common
run
of
men
i
know
with
strong
health
and
gross
appetites
must
have
variety
to
banish
because
the
imagination
never
lends
its
magic
wand
to
convert
appetite
into
love
cemented
by
according
ah
my
friend
you
know
not
the
ineffable
delight
the
exquisite
pleasure
which
arises
from
a
unison
of
affection
and
desire
when
the
whole
soul
and
senses
are
abandoned
to
a
lively
imagination
that
renders
every
emotion
delicate
and
rapturous
yes
these
are
emotions
over
which
satiety
has
no
power
and
the
recollection
of
which
even
disappointment
can
not
disenchant
but
they
do
not
exist
without
these
emotions
more
or
less
strong
appear
to
me
to
be
the
distinctive
characteristic
of
genius
the
foundation
of
taste
and
of
that
exquisite
relish
for
the
beauties
of
nature
of
which
the
common
herd
of
eaters
and
drinkers
and
certainly
have
no
idea
you
will
smile
at
an
observation
that
has
just
occurred
to
me
i
consider
those
minds
as
the
most
strong
and
original
whose
imagination
acts
as
the
stimulus
to
their
senses
well
you
will
ask
what
is
the
result
of
all
this
reasoning
why
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
it
is
possible
for
you
having
great
strength
of
mind
to
return
to
nature
and
regain
a
sanity
of
constitution
and
purity
of
feeling
which
would
open
your
heart
to
i
would
fain
rest
there
yet
convinced
more
than
ever
of
the
sincerity
and
tenderness
of
my
attachment
to
you
the
involuntary
hopes
which
a
determination
to
live
has
revived
are
not
sufficiently
strong
to
dissipate
the
cloud
that
despair
has
spread
over
futurity
i
have
looked
at
the
sea
and
at
my
child
hardly
daring
to
own
to
myself
the
secret
wish
that
it
might
become
our
tomb
and
that
the
heart
still
so
alive
to
anguish
might
there
be
quieted
by
death
at
this
moment
ten
thousand
complicated
sentiments
press
for
utterance
weigh
on
my
heart
and
obscure
my
sight
are
we
ever
to
meet
again
and
will
you
endeavour
to
render
that
meeting
happier
than
the
last
will
you
endeavour
to
restrain
your
caprices
in
order
to
give
vigour
to
affection
and
to
give
play
to
the
checked
sentiments
that
nature
intended
should
expand
your
heart
i
can
not
indeed
without
agony
think
of
your
bosom
being
continually
contaminated
and
bitter
are
the
tears
which
exhaust
my
eyes
when
i
recollect
why
my
child
and
i
are
forced
to
stray
from
the
asylum
in
which
after
so
many
storms
i
had
hoped
to
rest
smiling
at
angry
these
are
not
common
sorrows
nor
can
you
perhaps
conceive
how
much
active
fortitude
it
requires
to
labour
perpetually
to
blunt
the
shafts
of
disappointment
examine
now
yourself
and
ascertain
whether
you
can
live
in
something
like
a
settled
stile
let
our
confidence
in
future
be
unbounded
consider
whether
you
find
it
necessary
to
sacrifice
me
to
what
you
term
the
zest
of
life
and
when
you
have
once
a
clear
view
of
your
own
motives
of
your
own
incentive
to
action
do
not
deceive
me
the
train
of
thoughts
which
the
writing
of
this
epistle
awoke
makes
me
so
wretched
that
i
must
take
a
walk
to
rouse
and
calm
my
mind
but
first
let
me
tell
you
that
if
you
really
wish
to
promote
my
happiness
you
will
endeavour
to
give
me
as
much
as
you
can
of
yourself
you
have
great
mental
energy
and
your
judgment
seems
to
me
so
just
that
it
is
only
the
dupe
of
your
inclination
in
discussing
one
subject
the
post
does
not
go
out
i
may
write
more
tranquilly
i
can
not
yet
say
when
the
vessel
will
sail
in
which
i
have
determined
to
depart
hull
june
saturday
your
second
letter
reached
me
about
an
hour
ago
you
were
certainly
wrong
in
supposing
that
i
did
not
mention
you
with
respect
though
without
my
being
conscious
of
it
some
sparks
of
resentment
may
have
animated
the
gloom
of
despair
yes
with
less
affection
i
should
have
been
more
respectful
however
the
regard
which
i
have
for
you
is
so
unequivocal
to
myself
i
imagine
that
it
must
be
sufficiently
obvious
to
every
body
else
besides
the
only
letter
i
intended
for
the
public
eye
was
to
and
that
i
destroyed
from
delicacy
before
you
saw
them
because
it
was
only
written
of
course
warmly
in
your
praise
to
prevent
any
odium
being
thrown
on
you
i
am
harrassed
by
your
embarrassments
and
shall
certainly
use
all
my
efforts
to
make
the
business
terminate
to
your
satisfaction
in
which
i
am
engaged
my
friend
my
dearest
friend
i
feel
my
fate
united
to
yours
by
the
most
sacred
principles
of
my
soul
and
the
yearns
of
yes
i
will
say
it
a
true
unsophisticated
heart
yours
most
truly
mary
if
the
wind
be
fair
the
captain
talks
of
sailing
on
monday
but
i
am
afraid
i
shall
be
detained
some
days
longer
at
any
rate
continue
to
write
i
want
this
support
till
you
are
sure
i
am
where
i
can
not
expect
a
letter
and
if
any
should
arrive
after
my
departure
a
gentleman
not
friend
i
promise
you
from
whom
i
have
received
great
civilities
will
send
them
after
me
do
write
by
every
occasion
i
am
anxious
to
hear
how
your
affairs
go
on
and
still
more
to
be
convinced
that
you
are
not
separating
yourself
from
us
for
my
little
darling
is
calling
papa
and
adding
her
parrot
word
come
come
and
will
you
not
come
and
let
us
exert
ourselves
i
shall
recover
all
my
energy
when
i
am
convinced
that
my
exertions
will
draw
us
more
closely
together

letter
xlv

sunday
june
i
rather
expected
to
hear
from
you
i
wish
you
would
not
fail
to
write
to
me
for
a
little
time
because
i
am
not
quite
well
whether
i
have
any
good
sleep
or
not
i
wake
in
the
morning
in
violent
fits
of
trembling
and
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
the
child
every
thing
fatigues
me
in
which
i
seek
for
solace
or
amusement
forced
on
me
a
letter
to
a
physician
of
this
place
it
was
fortunate
for
i
should
otherwise
have
had
some
difficulty
to
obtain
the
necessary
information
his
wife
is
a
pretty
woman
i
can
admire
you
know
a
pretty
woman
when
i
am
alone
and
he
an
intelligent
and
rather
interesting
they
have
behaved
to
me
with
great
hospitality
and
poor
fanny
was
never
so
happy
in
her
life
as
amongst
their
young
brood
they
took
me
in
their
carriage
to
beverley
and
i
ran
over
my
favourite
walks
with
a
vivacity
that
would
have
astonished
the
town
did
not
please
me
quite
so
well
as
formerly
it
appeared
so
diminutive
and
when
i
found
that
many
of
the
inhabitants
had
lived
in
the
same
houses
ever
since
i
left
it
i
could
not
help
wondering
how
they
could
thus
have
vegetated
whilst
i
was
running
over
a
world
of
sorrow
snatching
at
pleasure
and
throwing
off
prejudices
the
place
where
i
at
present
am
is
much
improved
but
it
is
astonishing
what
strides
aristocracy
and
fanaticism
have
made
since
i
resided
in
this
country
the
wind
does
not
appear
inclined
to
change
so
i
am
still
forced
to
linger
when
do
you
think
that
you
shall
be
able
to
set
out
for
france
i
do
not
entirely
like
the
aspect
of
your
affairs
and
still
less
your
connections
on
either
side
of
the
water
often
do
i
sigh
when
i
think
of
your
entanglements
in
business
and
your
extreme
restlessness
of
even
now
i
am
almost
afraid
to
ask
you
whether
the
pleasure
of
being
free
does
not
overbalance
the
pain
you
felt
at
parting
with
me
sometimes
i
indulge
the
hope
that
you
will
feel
me
necessary
to
you
or
why
should
we
meet
again
but
the
moment
after
despair
damps
my
rising
spirits
aggravated
by
the
emotions
of
tenderness
which
ought
to
soften
the
cares
of
god
bless
you
yours
sincerely
and
affectionately
mary

i
want
to
know
how
you
have
settled
with
respect
to
in
short
be
very
particular
in
your
account
of
all
your
affairs
let
our
confidence
my
dear
be
the
last
time
we
were
separated
was
a
separation
indeed
on
your
part
now
you
have
acted
more
ingenuously
let
the
most
affectionate
interchange
of
sentiments
fill
up
the
aching
void
of
disappointment
i
almost
dread
that
your
plans
will
prove
abortive
yet
should
the
most
unlucky
turn
send
you
home
to
us
convinced
that
a
true
friend
is
a
treasure
i
should
not
much
mind
having
to
struggle
with
the
world
again
accuse
me
not
of
pride
yet
sometimes
when
nature
has
opened
my
heart
to
its
author
i
have
wondered
that
you
did
not
set
a
higher
value
on
my
heart
receive
a
kiss
from
fanny
i
was
going
to
add
if
you
will
not
take
one
from

the

has
just
sent
to
inform
me
that
i
must
be
on
board
in
the
course
of
a
few
i
wished
to
have
stayed
till
it
would
have
been
a
comfort
to
me
to
have
received
another
letter
from
you
should
one
arrive
it
will
be
sent
after
me
my
spirits
are
agitated
i
scarcely
know
why
the
quitting
england
seems
to
be
a
fresh
surely
you
will
not
forget
a
thousand
weak
forebodings
assault
my
soul
and
the
state
of
my
health
renders
me
sensible
to
every
thing
it
is
surprising
that
in
london
in
a
continual
conflict
of
mind
i
was
still
growing
better
whilst
here
bowed
down
by
the
despotic
hand
of
fate
forced
into
resignation
by
despair
i
seem
to
be
fading
away
perishing
beneath
a
cruel
blight
that
withers
up
all
my
faculties
the
child
is
perfectly
well
my
hand
seems
unwilling
to
add
adieu
i
know
not
why
this
inexpressible
sadness
has
taken
possession
of
it
is
not
a
presentiment
of
ill
yet
having
been
so
perpetually
the
sport
of
disappointment
having
a
heart
that
has
been
as
it
were
a
mark
for
misery
i
dread

meet
wretchedness
in
some
new

letter
xlviii
june
wednesday
i
was
hurried
on
board
yesterday
about
three
the
wind
having
changed
but
before
evening
it
veered
round
to
the
old
point
and
here
we
are
in
the
midst
of
mists
and
water
only
taking
advantage
of
the
tide
to
advance
a
few
miles
you
will
scarcely
suppose
that
i
left
the
town
with
reluctance
yet
it
was
even
so
for
i
wished
to
receive
another
letter
from
you
and
i
felt
pain
at
parting
for
ever
perhaps
from
the
amiable
family
who
had
treated
me
with
so
much
hospitality
and
kindness
they
will
probably
send
me
your
letter
if
it
arrives
this
morning
for
here
we
are
likely
to
remain
i
am
afraid
to
think
how
long
the
vessel
is
very
commodious
and
the
captain
a
civil
kind
of
man
there
being
no
other
passengers
i
have
the
cabin
to
myself
which
is
pleasant
and
i
have
brought
a
few
books
with
me
to
beguile
weariness
but
i
seem
inclined
rather
to
employ
the
dead
moments
of
suspence
in
writing
some
effusions
than
in
reading
what
are
you
about
how
are
your
affairs
going
on
it
may
be
a
long
time
before
you
answer
these
questions
my
dear
friend
my
heart
sinks
within
me
why
am
i
forced
thus
to
struggle
continually
with
my
affections
and
feelings
ah
why
are
those
affections
and
feelings
the
source
of
so
much
misery
when
they
seem
to
have
been
given
to
vivify
my
heart
and
extend
my
usefulness
but
i
must
not
dwell
on
this
will
you
not
endeavour
to
cherish
all
the
affection
you
can
for
me
what
am
i
saying
rather
forget
me
if
you
can
if
other
gratifications
are
dearer
to
how
is
every
remembrance
of
mine
embittered
by
disappointment
what
a
world
is
this
they
only
seem
happy
who
never
look
beyond
sensual
or
artificial
adieu
fanny
begins
to
play

here
i
am
still
and
i
have
just
received
your
letter
of
monday
by
the
pilot
who
promised
to
bring
it
to
me
if
we
were
detained
as
he
expected
by
the
it
is
indeed
wearisome
to
be
thus
tossed
about
without
going
i
have
a
violent
headache
yet
i
am
obliged
to
take
care
of
the
child
who
is
a
little
tormented
by
her
teeth
because
is
unable
to
do
any
thing
she
is
rendered
so
sick
by
the
motion
of
the
ship
as
we
ride
at
anchor
these
are
however
trifling
inconveniences
compared
with
anguish
of
mind
compared
with
the
sinking
of
a
broken
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
never
suffered
in
my
life
so
much
from
depression
of
spirits
from
i
do
not
sleep
or
if
i
close
my
eyes
it
is
to
have
the
most
terrifying
dreams
in
which
i
often
meet
you
with
different
casts
of
countenance
i
will
not
my
dear
imlay
torment
you
by
dwelling
on
my
sufferings
and
will
use
all
my
efforts
to
calm
my
mind
instead
of
deadening
it
at
present
it
is
most
painfully
active
i
find
i
am
not
equal
to
these
continual
struggles
yet
your
letter
this
morning
has
afforded
me
some
comfort
and
i
will
try
to
revive
hope
one
thing
let
me
tell
you
when
we
meet
again
surely
we
are
to
meet
it
must
be
to
part
no
more
i
mean
not
to
have
seas
between
us
it
is
more
than
i
can
support
the
pilot
is
hurrying
me
god
bless
you
in
spite
of
the
commodiousness
of
the
vessel
every
thing
here
would
disgust
my
senses
had
i
nothing
else
to
think
of
when
the

the

delicate
mine
has
been
too
much
hurt
to

truly
mary
letter
l
june
this
is
the
fifth
dreary
day
i
have
been
imprisoned
by
the
wind
with
every
outward
object
to
disgust
the
senses
and
unable
to
banish
the
remembrances
that
sadden
my
heart
how
am
i
altered
by
disappointment
when
going
to
lisbon
ten
years
ago
the
elasticity
of
my
mind
was
sufficient
to
ward
off
weariness
and
the
imagination
still
could
dip
her
brush
in
the
rainbow
of
fancy
and
sketch
futurity
in
smiling
colours
now
i
am
going
towards
the
north
in
search
of
sunbeams
will
any
ever
warm
this
desolated
heart
all
nature
seems
to
frown
or
rather
mourn
with
every
thing
is
cold
cold
as
my
expectations
before
i
left
the
shore
tormented
as
i
now
am
by
these
north
east
i
could
not
help
exclaiming
give
me
gracious
heaven
at
least
genial
weather
if
i
am
never
to
meet
the
genial
affection
that
still
warms
this
agitated
bosom
compelling
life
to
linger
there
i
am
now
going
on
shore
with
the
captain
though
the
weather
be
rough
to
seek
for
milk
at
a
little
village
and
to
take
a
walk
after
which
i
hope
to
sleep
for
confined
here
surrounded
by
disagreeable
smells
i
have
lost
the
little
appetite
i
had
and
i
lie
awake
till
thinking
almost
drives
me
to
the
brink
of
madness
only
to
the
brink
for
i
never
forget
even
in
the
feverish
slumbers
i
sometimes
fall
into
the
misery
i
am
labouring
to
blunt
the
sense
of
by
every
exertion
in
my
power
poor
still
continues
sick
and
grows
weary
when
the

will
not
allow
her
to
remain
on
deck
i
hope
this
will
be
the
last
letter
i
shall
write

you
not
tired
of
this
lingering
adieu

the

last
night
after
i
had
written
my
letter
to
you
intended
to
be
left
at
a
little
village
offered
to
go
to
to
pass
we
had
a
troublesome
sail
and
now
i
must
hurry
on
board
again
for
the
wind
has
changed
i
half
expected
to
find
a
letter
from
you
here
had
you
written
one
haphazard
it
would
have
been
kind
and
considerate
you
might
have
known
had
you
thought
that
the
wind
would
not
permit
me
to
depart
these
are
attentions
more
grateful
to
the
heart
than
offers
of
service
but
why
do
i
foolishly
continue
to
look
for
them
adieu
adieu
my
friend
your
friendship
is
very
cold
you
see
i
am
god
bless
you
i
may
perhaps
be
some
time
or
other
independent
in
every
sense
of
the
word
ah
there
is
but
one
sense
of
it
of
consequence
i
will
break
or
bend
this
weak
heart
yet
even
now
it
is
full
yours

after
vainly
attempting

at

i
have
now
but
a
moment
before
the
post
goes
out
to
inform
you
we
have
got
here
though
not
without
considerable
difficulty
for
we
were
set
ashore
in
a
boat
above
twenty
miles
below
what
i
suffered
in
the
vessel
i
will
not
now
descant
upon
nor
mention
the
pleasure
i
received
from
the
sight
of
the
rocky
this
morning
however
walking
to
join
the
carriage
that
was
to
transport
us
to
this
place
i
fell
without
any
previous
warning
senseless
on
the
rocks
and
how
i
escaped
with
life
i
can
scarcely
guess
i
was
in
a
stupour
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
suffusion
of
blood
at
last
restored
me
to
my
senses
the
contusion
is
great
and
my
brain
confused

well
twenty
miles

after
my
accident
has
sufficiently
deranged
me
and
here
i
could
not
get
a
fire
to
warm
me
or
any
thing
warm
to
eat
the

are
mere

i
must
nevertheless
go
to

for

sake
let

i
wrote
to
you
by
the
last
post
to
inform
you
of
my
arrival
and
i
believe
i
alluded
to
the
extreme
fatigue
i
endured
on
owing
to
illness
and
the
roughness
of
the
weather
i
likewise
mentioned
to
you
my
fall
the
effects
of
which
i
still
feel
though
i
do
not
think
it
will
have
any
serious
consequences
will
go
with
me
if
i
find
it
necessary
to
go
to
the
inns
here
are
so
bad
i
was
forced
to
accept
of
an
apartment
in
his
house
i
am
overwhelmed
with
civilities
on
all
sides
and
fatigued
with
the
endeavours
to
amuse
me
from
which
i
can
not
escape
my
friend
my
friend
i
am
not
well
a
deadly
weight
of
sorrow
lies
heavily
on
my
heart
i
am
again
tossed
on
the
troubled
billows
of
life
and
obliged
to
cope
with
difficulties
without
being
buoyed
up
by
the
hopes
that
alone
render
them
bearable
how
flat
dull
and
unprofitable
appears
to
me
all
the
bustle
into
which
i
see
people
here
so
eagerly
enter
i
long
every
night
to
go
to
bed
to
hide
my
melancholy
face
in
my
pillow

there
is
a
in
my
bosom
that
never

i
labour
in
vain
to
calm
my
mind
my
soul
has
been
overwhelmed
by
sorrow
and
disappointment
every
thing
fatigues
me
this
is
a
life
that
can
not
last
long
it
is
you
who
must
determine
with
respect
to
futurity
and
when
you
have
i
will
act
accordingly
i
mean
we
must
either
resolve
to
live
together
or
part
for
ever
i
can
not
bear
these
continual
but
i
wish
you
to
examine
carefully
your
own
heart
and
mind
and
if
you
perceive
the
least
chance
of
being
happier
without
me
than
with
me
or
if
your
inclination
leans
capriciously
to
that
side
do
not
dissemble
but
tell
me
frankly
that
you
will
never
see
me
more
i
will
then
adopt
the
plan
i
mentioned
to
you
for
we
must
either
live
together
or
i
will
be
entirely
independent
my
heart
is
so
oppressed
i
can
not
write
with
precision
you
know
however
that
what
i
so
imperfectly
express
are
not
the
crude
sentiments
of
the
moment
you
can
only
contribute
to
my
comfort
it
is
the
consolation
i
am
in
need
of
by
being
with
me
and
if
the
tenderest
friendship
is
of
any
value
why
will
you
not
look
to
me
for
a
degree
of
satisfaction
that
heartless
affections
can
not
bestow
tell
me
then
will
you
determine
to
meet
me
at
basle
i
shall
i
should
imagine
be
at
before
the
close
of
august
and
after
you
settle
your
affairs
at

could
we
not

poor
fanny
has
suffered
during
the
journey
with
her
teeth
letter
lv
sweden
july
there
was
a
gloominess
diffused
through
your
last
letter
the
impression
of
which
still
rests
on
my
mind
though
recollecting
how
quickly
you
throw
off
the
forcible
feelings
of
the
moment
i
flatter
myself
it
has
long
since
given
place
to
your
usual
cheerfulness
believe
me
and
my
eyes
fill
with
tears
of
tenderness
as
i
assure
you
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
endure
in
the
way
of
privation
rather
than
disturb
your
if
i
am
fated
to
be
unhappy
i
will
labour
to
hide
my
sorrows
in
my
own
bosom
and
you
shall
always
find
me
a
faithful
affectionate
friend
i
grow
more
and
more
attached
to
my
little
girl
and
i
cherish
this
affection
without
fear
because
it
must
be
a
long
time
before
it
can
become
bitterness
of
she
is
an
interesting
on
how
often
as
i
gazed
at
the
sea
have
i
longed
to
bury
my
troubled
bosom
in
the
less
troubled
deep
asserting
with
brutus
that
the
virtue
i
had
followed
too
far
was
merely
an
empty
name
and
nothing
but
the
sight
of
her
her
playful
smiles
which
seemed
to
cling
and
twine
round
my
heart
could
have
stopped
me
what
peculiar
misery
has
fallen
to
my
share
to
act
up
to
my
principles
i
have
laid
the
strictest
restraint
on
my
very
thoughts
yes
not
to
sully
the
delicacy
of
my
feelings
i
have
reined
in
my
imagination
and
started
with
affright
from
every
sensation
i
allude
to
that
stealing
with
balmy
sweetness
into
my
soul
led
me
to
scent
from
afar
the
fragrance
of
reviving
nature
my
friend
i
have
dearly
paid
for
one
love
in
some
minds
is
an
affair
of
sentiment
arising
from
the
same
delicacy
of
perception
or
taste
as
renders
them
alive
to
the
beauties
of
nature
poetry
alive
to
the
charms
of
those
evanescent
graces
that
are
as
it
were
impalpable
they
must
be
felt
they
can
not
be
described
love
is
a
want
of
my
heart
i
have
examined
myself
lately
with
more
care
than
formerly
and
find
that
to
deaden
is
not
to
calm
the
mind
aiming
at
tranquillity
i
have
almost
destroyed
all
the
energy
of
my
soul
almost
rooted
out
what
renders
it
estimable
yes
i
have
damped
that
enthusiasm
of
character
which
converts
the
grossest
materials
into
a
fuel
that
imperceptibly
feeds
hopes
which
aspire
above
common
enjoyment
despair
since
the
birth
of
my
child
has
rendered
me
stupid
soul
and
body
seemed
to
be
fading
away
before
the
withering
touch
of
disappointment
i
am
now
endeavouring
to
recover
myself
and
such
is
the
elasticity
of
my
constitution
and
the
purity
of
the
atmosphere
here
that
health
unsought
for
begins
to
reanimate
my
countenance
i
have
the
sincerest
esteem
and
affection
for
you
but
the
desire
of
regaining
peace
do
you
understand
me
has
made
me
forget
the
respect
due
to
my
own
emotions
sacred
emotions
that
are
the
sure
harbingers
of
the
delights
i
was
formed
to
enjoy
and
shall
enjoy
for
nothing
can
extinguish
the
heavenly
spark
still
when
we
meet
again
i
will
not
torment
you
i
promise
you
i
blush
when
i
recollect
my
former
conduct
and
will
not
in
future
confound
myself
with
the
beings
whom
i
feel
to
be
my
i
will
listen
to
delicacy

pride
letter

sweden
july
i
hope
to
hear
from
you
by
mail
my
dearest
friend
i
can
not
tear
my
affections
from
you
and
though
every
remembrance
stings
me
to
the
soul
i
think
of
you
till
i
make
allowance
for
the
very
defects
of
character
that
have
given
such
a
cruel
stab
to
my
peace
still
however
i
am
more
alive
than
you
have
seen
me
for
a
long
long
time
i
have
a
degree
of
vivacity
even
in
my
grief
which
is
preferable
to
the
benumbing
stupour
that
for
the
last
year
has
frozen
up
all
my
perhaps
this
change
is
more
owing
to
returning
health
than
to
the
vigour
of
my
reason
for
in
spite
of
sadness
and
surely
i
have
had
my
share
the
purity
of
this
air
and
the
being
continually
out
in
it
for
i
sleep
in
the
country
every
night
has
made
an
alteration
in
my
appearance
that
really
surprises
the
rosy
fingers
of
health
already
streak
my
cheeks
and
i
have
seen
a
life
in
my
eyes
after
i
have
been
climbing
the
rocks
that
resembled
the
fond
credulous
hopes
of
youth
with
what
a
cruel
sigh
have
i
recollected
that
i
had
forgotten
to
hope
reason
or
rather
experience
does
not
thus
cruelly
damp
poor
pleasures
she
plays
all
day
in

without

will
you
not
come

us
in

ah
why
do
not
you
love
us
with
more

why
are
you
a
creature
of
such
sympathy
that
the
warmth
of
your
feelings
or
rather
quickness
of
your
senses
hardens
your
heart
it
is
my
misfortune
that
my
imagination
is
perpetually
shading
your
defects
and
lending
you
charms
whilst
the
grossness
of
your
senses
makes
you
call
me
not

overlook
graces
in
me
that
only
dignity
of
mind
and
the
sensibility

i
could
not
help
feeling
extremely
mortified
last
post
at
not
receiving
a
letter
from
you
my
being
at
was
but
a
chance
and
you
might
have
hazarded
it
and
would
a
year
ago
i
shall
not
however
complain
there
are
misfortunes
so
great
as
to
silence
the
usual
expressions
of
sorrow
believe
me
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
broken
heart
there
are
characters
whose
very
energy
preys
upon
them
and
who
ever
inclined
to
cherish
by
reflection
some
passion
can
not
rest
satisfied
with
the
common
comforts
of
life
i
have
endeavoured
to
fly
from
myself
and
launched
into
all
the
dissipation
possible
here
only
to
feel
keener
anguish
when
alone
with
my
child
still
could
any
thing
please
me
had
not
disappointment
cut
me
off
from
life
this
romantic
country
these
fine
evenings
would
interest
my
god
can
any
thing
and
am
i
ever
to
feel
alive
only
to
painful
sensations
but
it
can
not
it
shall
not
last
long
the
post
is
again
arrived
i
have
sent
to
seek
for

seems
on
fire

i
am
now
on
my
journey
to
tonsberg
i
felt
more
at
leaving
my
child
than
i
thought
i
should
and
whilst
at
night
i
imagined
every
instant
that
i
heard
the
sounds
of
her
voice
i
asked
myself
how
i
could
think
of
parting
with
her
for
ever
of
leaving
her
thus
helpless
poor
lamb
it
may
run
very
well
in
a
tale
that
god
will
temper
the
winds
to
the
shorn
lamb
but
how
can
i
expect
that
she
will
be
shielded
when
my
naked
bosom
has
had
to
brave
continually
the
pitiless
storm
yes
i
could
add
with
poor
lear
what
is
the
war
of
elements
to
the
pangs
of
disappointed
affection
and
the
horror
arising
from
a
discovery
of
a
breach
of
confidence
that
snaps
every
social
tie
all
is
not
right
somewhere
when
you
first
knew
me
i
was
not
thus
lost
i
could
still
confide
for
i
opened
my
heart
to
you
of
this
only
comfort
you
have
deprived
me
whilst
my
happiness
you
tell
me
was
your
first
object
strange
want
of
judgment
i
will
not
complain
but
from
the
soundness
of
your
understanding
i
am
convinced
if
you
give
yourself
leave
to
reflect
you
will
also
feel
that
your
conduct
to
me
so
far
from
being
generous
has
not
been
i
mean
not
to
allude
to
factitious
principles
of
morality
but
to
the
simple
basis
of
all
however
i
did
not
intend
to
argue
your
not
writing
is
cruel
and
my
reason
is
perhaps
disturbed
by
constant
wretchedness
poor
would
fain
have
accompanied
me
out
of
tenderness
for
my
fainting
or
rather
convulsion
when
i
landed
and
my
sudden
changes
of
countenance
since
have
alarmed
her
so
much
that
she
is
perpetually
afraid
of
some
but
it
would
have
injured
the
child
this
warm
season
as
she
is
cutting
her
teeth
i
hear
not
of
your
having
written
to
me
at

very
well
act

you

there
is
nothing
i

discharge

i
have
just
received
two
of
your

dated
the

and
you
must
have
received
several
from
me
informing
you
of
my

and
how
much
i
was
hurt
by
your
silence
write
to
me
then
my

and
write
explicitly
i
have
suffered
god
knows
since
i
left
you
ah
you
have
never
felt
this
kind
of
sickness
of
heart
my
mind
however
is
at
present
painfully
active
and
the
sympathy
i
feel
almost
rises
to
agony
but
this
is
not
a
subject
of
complaint
it
has
afforded
me
pleasure
and
reflected
pleasure
is
all
i
have
to
hope
for
if
a
spark
of
hope
be
yet
alive
in
my
forlorn
bosom
i
will
try
to
write
with
a
degree
of
composure
i
wish
for
us
to
live
together
because
i
want
you
to
acquire
an
habitual
tenderness
for
my
poor
girl
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
leaving
her
alone
in
the
world
or
that
she
should
only
be
protected
by
your
sense
of
duty
next
to
preserving
her
my
most
earnest
wish
is
not
to
disturb
your
peace
i
have
nothing
to
expect
and
little
to
fear
in
life
there
are
wounds
that
can
never
be
healed
but
they
may
be
allowed
to
fester
in
silence
without
wincing
when
we
meet
again
you
shall
be
convinced
that
i
have
more
resolution
than
you
give
me
credit
for
i
will
not
torment
you
if
i
am
destined
always
to
be
disappointed
and
unhappy
i
will
conceal
the
anguish

the
tightened
cord
of
life
or
reason

at
last
snap
and
set
me
free
yes
i
shall
be
happy
this
heart
is
worthy
of
the
bliss
its
feelings
anticipate
and
i
can
not
even
persuade
myself
wretched
as
they
have
made
me
that
my
principles
and
sentiments
are
not
founded
in
nature
and
truth
but
to
have
done
with
these
subjects
i
have
been
seriously
employed
in

employment
and

have
been
of
great
service
to
me
and
i
have
entirely
recovered
the
strength
and
activity
i
lost
during
the
time
of
my
nursing
i
have
seldom
been
in
better
health
and
my
mind
though
trembling
to
the
touch
of
anguish
is
calmer

still
the
i
have
it

true
enjoyed
some
tranquillity

more
happiness
here
than
for
a
long
long

i

happiness
for
i
can
give
no
other
appellation
to
the
exquisite
delight
this
wild
country
and
fine
summer
have
afforded
me
still
on
examining
my
heart
i
find
that
it
is
so
constituted
i
can
not
live
without
some
particular
affection
i
am
afraid
not
without
a
passion
and
i
feel
the
want
of
it
more
in
society
than
in
solitude
writing
to
you
whenever
an
affectionate
epithet
occurs
my
eyes
fill
with
tears
and
my
trembling
hand
stops
you
may
then
depend
on
my
resolution
when
with
you
if
i
am
doomed
to
be
unhappy
i
will
confine
my
anguish
in
my
own
bosom
tenderness
rather
than
passion
has
made
me
sometimes
overlook
delicacy
the
same
tenderness
will
in

restrain

my

not

you
that
my

is
calm
though
i
have
snatched
some
moments
of
exquisite
delight
wandering
through

resting

this

of
suspense
my

is
intolerable
we
must
determine
on
something
and
soon
we
must
meet
shortly
or
part
for

i
am
sensible
that
i
acted
foolishly

i
was
wretched

we
were

expecting
too
much

might

not

reason
have
i
to
expect
a
shadow
of
happiness
after
the
cruel
disappointments
that
have
rent
my

that
of
my

to
depend
on
our
being

still
i
do
not
wish
you
to
sacrifice
a
chance
of
enjoyment
for
an
uncertain

i
feel
a

that
i
can
provide
for
her
and
it
shall
be
my
object
if
we
are
indeed
to

to

no

her
affection
must
not
be

she
must
be
a
comfort
to
me
if
i
am
to
have
no

only
know
me
as
her
support
i
feel
that
i
can

the

of
corresponding
with
you
if
we

you

my

for

spare

new

i

ought
to

i

have
merited

did
not

from

this
is

i
arrived
here
last
night
and
with
the
most
exquisite
delight
once
more
pressed
my
babe
to
my
heart
we
shall
part
no
more
you
perhaps
can
not
conceive
the
pleasure
it
gave
me
to
see
her
run
about
and
play
alone
her
increasing
intelligence
attaches
me
more
and
more
to
her
i
have
promised
her
that
i
will
fulfil
my
duty
to
her
and
nothing
in
future
shall
make
me
forget
it
i
will
also
exert
myself
to
obtain
an
independence
for
her
but
i
will
not
be
too
anxious
on
this
head
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
have
recovered
my
health
vigour
and
even
vivacity
of
mind
have
returned
with
a
renovated
constitution
as
for
peace
we
will
not
talk
of
it
i
was
not
made
perhaps
to
enjoy
the
calm
contentment
so
you
tell
me
that
my
letters
torture
you
i
will
not
describe
the
effect
yours
have
on
me
i
received
three
this
morning
the
last
dated
the
of
this
month
i
mean
not
to
give
vent
to
the
emotions
they
certainly
you
are
right
our
minds
are
not
congenial
i
have
lived
in
an
ideal
world
and
fostered
sentiments
that
you
do
not
comprehend
or
you
would
not
treat
me
thus
i
am
not
i
will
not
be
merely
an
object
of
compassion
a
clog
however
light
to
teize
you
forget
that
i
exist
i
will
never
remind
you
something
emphatical
whispers
me
to
put
an
end
to
these
struggles
be
free
i
will
not
torment
when
i
can
not
please
i
can
take
care
of
my
child
you
need
not
continually
tell
me
that
our
fortune
is
inseparable
you
will
try
to
cherish
for
me
do
no
violence
to
yourself
when
we
are
separated
our
interest
since
you
give
so
much
weight
to
pecuniary
considerations
will
be
entirely
divided
i
want
not
protection
without
affection
and
support
i
need
not
whilst
my
faculties
are
undisturbed
i
had
a
dislike
to
living
in
england
but
painful
feelings
must
give
way
to
superior
considerations
i
may
not
be
able
to
acquire
the
sum
necessary
to
maintain
my
child
and
self
elsewhere
it
is
too
late
to
go
to
switzerland
i
shall
not
remain
at
living
expensively
but
be
not
alarmed
i
shall
not
force
myself
on
you
any
more
adieu
i
am
agitated
my
whole
frame
is
convulsed
my
lips
tremble
as
if
shook
by
cold
though
fire
seems
to
be
circulating
in
my
veins

september
i
received
just
now
your
letter
of
the
i
had
written
you
a
letter
last
night
into
which
imperceptibly
slipt
some
of
my
bitterness
of
soul
i
will
copy
the
part
relative
to
business
i
am
not
sufficiently
vain
to
imagine
that
i
can
for
more
than
a
moment
cloud
your
enjoyment
of
life
to
prevent
even
that
you
had
better
never
hear
from
me
and
repose
on
the
idea
that
i
am
happy
gracious
god
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
stifle
something
like
resentment
when
i
receive
fresh
proofs
of
your
indifference
what
i
have
suffered
this
last
year
is
not
to
be
forgotten
i
have
not
that
happy
substitute
for
wisdom
insensibility
and
the
lively
sympathies
which
bind
me
to
my
are
all
of
a
painful
they
are
the
agonies
of
a
broken
heart
pleasure
and
i
have
shaken
hands
i
see
here
nothing
but
heaps
of
ruins
and
only
converse
with
people
immersed
in
trade
and
sensuality
i
am
weary
of
travelling
yet
seem
to
have
no
home
no
to
look
i
am
strangely
cast
how
often
passing
through
the
rocks
i
have
thought
but
for
this
child
i
would
lay
my
head
on
one
of
them
and
never
open
my
eyes
again
with
a
heart
feelingly
alive
to
all
the
affections
of
my
nature
i
have
never
met
with
one
softer
than
the
stone
that
i
would
fain
take
for
my
last
pillow
i
once
thought
i
had
but
it
was
all
a
delusion
i
meet
with
families
continually
who
are
bound
together
by
affection
or
principle
and
when
i
am
conscious
that
i
have
fulfilled
the
duties
of
my
station
almost
to
a
forgetfulness
of
myself
i
am
ready
to
demand
in
a
murmuring
tone
of
heaven
why
am
i
thus
abandoned
you
say
now
i
do
not
understand
you
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
write
more
explicitly
and
determine
on
some
mode
of
i
can
not
endure
this
suspense
decide
do
you
fear
to
strike
another
blow
we
live
together
or
eternally
part
i
shall
not
write
to
you
again
till
i
receive
an
answer
to
this
i
must
compose
my
tortured
soul
before
i
write
on
indifferent
subjects
i
do
not
know
whether
i
write
intelligibly
for
my
head
is
disturbed
but
this
you
ought
to
pardon
for
it
is
with
difficulty
frequently
that
i
make
out
what
you
mean
to
say
you
write
i
suppose
at
after
dinner
when
your
head
is
not
the
clearest
and
as
for
your
heart
if
you
have
one
i
see
nothing
like
the
dictates
of

lxvi
hamburg
september
i
have
just
finished
a
letter
to
be
given
in
charge
to
captain
in
that
i
complained
of
your
silence
and
expressed
my
surprise
that
three
mails
should
have
arrived
without
bringing
a
line
for
me
since
i
closed
it
i
hear
of
another
and
still
no
i
am
labouring
to
write
calmly
this
silence
is
a
refinement
on
cruelty
had
captain
remained
a
few
days
longer
i
would
have
returned
with
him
to
england
what
have
i
to
do
here
i
have
repeatedly
written
to
you
fully
do
you
do
the
same
and
quickly
do
not
leave
me
in
suspense
i
have
not
deserved
this
of
you
i
can
not
write
my
mind
is
so
distressed

when
you

this
i
shall
either
have
landed
or
be
hovering
on
the
british
coast
your
letter
of
the
decided
me
by
what
criterion
of
principle
or
affection
you
term
my
questions
extraordinary
and
unnecessary
i
can
not
you
desire
me
to
decide
i
had
decided
you
must
have
had
long
ago
two
letters
of
mine
from
to
the
same
purport
to
in
these
god
knows
there
was
but
too
much
affection
and
the
agonies
of
a
distracted
mind
were
but
too
faithfully
pourtrayed
what
more
then
had
i
to
say
the
negative
was
to
come
from
you
had
perpetually
recurred
to
your
promise
of
meeting
me
in
the
autumn
was
it
extraordinary
that
i
should
demand
a
yes
or
no
your
letter
is
written
with
extreme
harshness
coldness
i
am
accustomed
to
in
it
i
find
not
a
trace
of
the
tenderness
of
humanity
much
less
of
i
only
see
a
desire
to
heave
a
load
off
your
shoulders
i
am
above
disputing
about
it
matters
not
in
what
terms
you
decide
the
tremendous
power
who
formed
this
heart
must
have
foreseen
that
in
a
world
in
which
in
various
shapes
is
the
principal
mobile
i
had
little
chance
of
escaping
to
the
fiat
of
fate
i
i
am
content
to
be
wretched
but
i
will
not
be
of
me
you
have
no
cause
to
complain
but
for
having
had
too
much
regard
for
you
for
having
expected
a
degree
of
permanent
happiness
when
you
only
sought
for
a
momentary
gratification
i
am
strangely
deficient
in
uniting
myself
to
you
your
tenderness
seemed
to
make
me
amends
for
all
my
former
on
this
tenderness
and
affection
with
what
confidence
did
i
rest
but
i
leaned
on
a
spear
that
has
pierced
me
to
the
you
have
thrown
off
a
faithful
friend
to
pursue
the
caprices
of
the
we
certainly
are
differently
organized
for
even
now
when
conviction
has
been
stamped
on
my
soul
by
sorrow
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
possible
it
depends
at
present
on
you
whether
you
will
see
me
or
i
shall
take
no
step
till
i
see
or
hear
from
you
preparing
myself
for
the
worst
i
have
determined
if
your
next
letter
be
like
the
last
to
write
to
to
procure
me
an
obscure
lodging
and
not
to
inform
any
body
of
my
there
i
will
endeavour
in
a
few
months
to
obtain
the
sum
necessary
to
take
me
to
france
from
you
i
will
not
receive
any
i
am
not
yet
sufficiently
humbled
to
depend
on
your
beneficence
some
people
whom
my
unhappiness
has
interested
though
they
know
not
the
extent
of
it
will
assist
me
to
attain
the
object
i
have
in
view
the
independence
of
my
child
should
a
peace
take
place
ready
money
will
go
a
great
way
in
france
and
i
will
borrow
a
sum
which
my
industry
enable
me
to
pay
at
my
leisure
to
purchase
a
small
estate
for
my
the
assistance
i
shall
find
necessary
to
complete
her
education
i
can
get
at
an
easy
rate
at
paris
i
can
introduce
her
to
such
society
as
she
will
like
and
thus
securing
for
her
all
the
chance
for
happiness
which
depends
on
me
i
shall
die
in
peace
persuaded
that
the
felicity
which
has
hitherto
cheated
my
expectation
will
not
always
elude
my
grasp
no
poor

ever
more
earnestly
longed

not

up

all
the

inform
you
where
i

it
is
needless
to
add
that
i

not
in

to

you

letter
lxviii
dover
sunday
october
i
wrote
to
you
by
the
packet
to
inform
you
that
your
letter
of
the
of
last
month
had
determined
me
to
set
out
with
captain
but
as
we
sailed
very
quick
i
take
it
for
granted
that
you
have
not
yet
received
it
you
say
i
must
decide
for
i
had
decided
that
it
was
most
for
the
interest
of
my
little
girl
and
for
my
own
comfort
little
as
i
expect
for
us
to
live
together
and
i
even
thought
that
you
would
be
glad
some
years
hence
when
the
tumult
of
business
was
over
to
repose
in
the
society
of
an
affectionate
friend
and
mark
the
progress
of
our
interesting
child
whilst
endeavouring
to
be
of
use
in
the
circle
you
at
last
resolved
to
rest
in
for
you
can
not
run
about
for
ever
from
the
tenour
of
your
last
letter
however
i
am
led
to
imagine
that
you
have
formed
some
new
if
it
be
so
let
me
earnestly
request
you
to
see
me
once
more
and
immediately
this
is
the
only
proof
i
require
of
the
friendship
you
profess
for
me
i
will
then
decide
since
you
boggle
about
a
mere
form
i
am
labouring
to
write
with
calmness
but
the
extreme
anguish
i
feel
at
landing
without
having
any
friend
to
receive
me
and
even
to

the

i
have
only
to
lament
that
when
the
bitterness
of
death
was
past
i
was
inhumanly
brought
back
to
life
and
misery
but
a
fixed
determination
is
not
to
be
baffled
by
disappointment
nor
will
i
allow
that
to
be
a
frantic
attempt
which
was
one
of
the
calmest
acts
of
reason
in
this
respect
i
am
only
accountable
to
myself
did
i
care
for
what
is
termed
reputation
it
is
by
other
circumstances
that
i
should
be
dishonoured
you
say
that
you
know
not
how
to
extricate
ourselves
out
of
the
wretchedness
into
which
we
have
been
plunged
you
are
extricated
long
but
i
forbear
to
if
i
am
condemned
to
live
longer
it
is
a
living
death
it
appears
to
me
that
you
lay
much
more
stress
on
delicacy
than
on
principle
for
i
am
unable
to
discover
what
sentiment
of
delicacy
would
have
been
violated
by
your
visiting
a
wretched
friend
if
indeed
you
have
any
friendship
for
but
since
your
new
attachment
is
the
only
thing
sacred
in
your
eyes
i
am
silent
be
happy
my
complaints
shall
never
more
damp
your
enjoyment
perhaps
i
am
mistaken
in
supposing
that
even
my
death
could
for
more
than
a
this
is
what
you
call
it
is
happy
for
yourself
that
you
possess
this
quality
in
the
highest
degree
your
continually
asserting
that
you
will
do
all
in
your
power
to
contribute
to
my
comfort
when
you
only
allude
to
pecuniary
assistance
appears
to
me
a
flagrant
breach
of
i
want
not
such
vulgar
comfort
nor
will
i
accept
it
i
never
wanted
but
your
heart
that
gone
you
have
nothing
more
to
give
had
i
only
poverty
to
fear
i
should
not
shrink
from
forgive
me
then
if
i
say
that
i
shall
consider
any
direct
or
indirect
attempt
to
supply
my
necessities
as
an
insult
which
i
have
not
merited
and
as
rather
done
out
of
tenderness
for
your
own
reputation
than
for
me
do
not
mistake
me
i
do
not
think
that
you
value
money
therefore
i
will
not
accept
what
you

not

less

certain

are

i

that
the

it

an

the

aside
i
did
not
wish

look
over
a

my
not

for
my

written
to
you
with
anger
under
the
impression
your
departure
without
even
a
line
left
for
me
made
on
me
even
after
your
late
conduct
which
could
not
lead
me
to
expect
much
attention
to
my
sufferings
in
fact
the
decided
conduct
which
appeared
to
me
so
unfeeling
has
almost
overturned

injured

what

the
grief
i
can
not
conquer
for
some
cruel
recollections
never
quit
me
banishing
almost
every

labour
to
conceal
in

my

therefore
is
but
an
exercise
of
fortitude
continually
on
the
stretch
and
hope
never
gleams
in
this
tomb
where
i
am
buried
alive
but
i
meant
to
reason
with
you
and
not
to
you
tell
me
that
i
shall
judge
more
coolly
of
your
mode
of
acting
some
time
hence
but
is
it
not
possible
that
clouds
your
reason
as
much
as
it
does
mine
and
ought
you
not
to
doubt
whether
those
principles
are
so
exalted
as
you
term
them
which
only
lead
to
your
own
gratification
in
other
words
whether
it
be
just
to
have
no
principle
of
action
but
that
of
following
your
inclination
trampling
on
the
affection
you
have
fostered

the
expectations
you
have
excited
my

for

which
you
have

i
thought
i
could
quickly
have
refuted
all
your
arguments
but
my
head
is
right
or
wrong
i
am
miserable
it
seems
to
me
that
my
conduct
has
always
been
governed
by
the
strictest
principles
of
justice
and
yet
how
wretched
have
my
social
feelings
and
delicacy
of
sentiment
rendered
me
i
have
loved
with
my
whole
soul
only
to
discover
that
i
had
no
chance
of
a
return
and
that
existence
is
a
burthen
without
it
i
do
not
perfectly
understand
if
by
the

of
your

you
still
only

you
will
not
continue

call
those
capricious
feelings
the
most
refined
which
would
undermine
not

the
most
sacred
principles
but
the
affections
which
unite
you
would
render
mothers
unnatural
and
there
would
be
no
such

if
your
theory
of
morals
is
the

certainly
the

that
my

has
reached

resentment

even
anger
are

i
wished
to
tell

so
that
if
you
ever
think
of
me
it
may
not
be
in
the

that
i

ever

not

do

i

even

a

ah
ask
yourself
if
you
have
not
condescended
to
employ
a

i
could
almost
say
cunning
unworthy

you
principles
are
sacred
things

we
never

with
truth
with
impunity
the
expectation
i

too
fondly
nourished
it
of
regaining
your
affection
every

grows
fainter

indeed
it
seems
to
me
when
i
am
more
sad
than
usual
that
i
shall
never
see
you
yet
you
will
not
always
forget
you
will
feel
something
like
remorse
for
having
lived
only
for
yourself
and
sacrificed
my
peace
to
inferior
gratifications
in
a
comfortless
old
age
you
will
remember
that
you
had
one
disinterested
friend
whose
heart
you
wounded
to
the

the
hour
of

that
your

your

your

are
all
superior
to
your

you
do
you
must
respect
me
and
you
will
be
sorry
to
forfeit
my

you
know
best
whether
i
am
still
preserving
the
remembrance
of
an
imaginary

once
thought
that
i
knew
you
thoroughly
but
now
i
am
obliged
to
leave
some
doubts
that
involuntarily
press
on
me
to
be
cleared
up
by
time
you
may
render
me
unhappy
but
can
not
make
me
contemptible
in
my
own
i
shall
still
be
able
to
support
my

though
i
am
disappointed
in
some
other
plans
of
usefulness
which
i
once
believed
would
have
afforded
you
equal
pleasure
whilst
i
was
with
you
i
restrained
my
natural
generosity
because
i
thought
your

in

i
went

i
requested
you
you
could
not
to
forget
my
father
sisters
and
some

whom
i
was
interested
money
was
lavished
away
yet
not

my
requests
were
neglected
but
some
trifling
debts
were
not
discharged
that

i

me
with

you
endeavoured
to
remove
the

even
before

you
took
great

all
my

occasioned
by
the

i
and
virtue
should
at
last
prevail
i
still
thought
that
you
had
a
magnanimity
of
character
which
would
enable
you
to
conquer
yourself
imlay
believe
me
it
is
not
romance
you
have
acknowledged
to
me
feelings
of
this
you
could
restore
me
to
life
and
hope
and
the
satisfaction
you
would
feel
would
amply
repay
you
in
tearing
myself
from
you
it
is
my
own
heart
i
pierce
and
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
lament
that
you
have
thrown
away
a
heart
that
even
in
the
moment
of
passion
you
can
not
i
would
owe
every
thing
to
your
generosity
but
for
god
sake
keep
me
no
longer

you
must
do
as
you
please
with
respect
to
the
i
could
wish
that
it
might
be
done
soon
that
my
name
may
be
no
more
mentioned
to
you
it
is
now
convinced
that
you
have
neither
regard
nor
friendship
i
disdain
to
utter
a
reproach
though
i
have
had
reason
to
think
that
the
forbearance
talked
of
has
not
been
very
it
is
however
of
no
i
am
glad
you
are
satisfied
with
your
own
conduct
i
now
solemnly
assure
you
that
this
is
an
eternal
yet
i
flinch
not
from
the
duties
which
tie
me
to
life
that
there
is
sophistry
on
one
side
or
other
is
certain
but
now
it
matters
not
on
which
on
my
part
it
has
not
been
a
question
of
words
yet
your
understanding
or
mine
must
be
strangely
warped
for
what
you
term
delicacy
appears
to
me
to
be
exactly
the
contrary
i
have
no
criterion
for
morality
and
have
thought
in
vain
if
the
sensations
which
lead
you
to
follow
an
ancle
or
step
be
the
sacred
foundation
of
principle
and
affection
mine
has
been
of
a
very
different
nature
or
it
would
not
have
stood
the
brunt
of
your
sarcasms
the
sentiment
in
me
is
still
sacred
if
there
be
any
part
of
me
that
will
survive
the
sense
of
my
misfortunes
it
is
the
purity
of
my
affections
the
impetuosity
of
your
senses
may
have
led
you
to
term
mere
animal
desire
the
source
of
principle
and
it
may
give
zest
to
some
years
to
whether
you
will
always
think
so
i
shall
never
know
it
is
strange
that
in
spite
of
all
you
do
something
like
conviction
forces
me
to
believe
that
you
are
not
what
you
appear
to
be
