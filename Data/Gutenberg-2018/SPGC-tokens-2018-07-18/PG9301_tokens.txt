chapter
i
introductory
i
do
not
intend
to
carry
my
story
one
month
beyond
the
hour
when
i
saw
that
my
boyhood
was
gone
and
my
youth
arrived
a
period
determined
to
some
by
the
first
to
me
by
a
different
sign
my
reason
for
wishing
to
tell
this
first
portion
of
my
history
is
that
when
i
look
back
upon
it
it
seems
to
me
not
only
so
pleasant
but
so
full
of
meaning
that
if
i
can
only
tell
it
right
it
must
prove
rather
pleasant
and
not
quite
unmeaning
to
those
who
will
read
it
it
will
prove
a
very
poor
story
to
such
as
care
only
for
stirring
adventures
and
like
them
all
the
better
for
a
pretty
strong
infusion
of
the
impossible
but
those
to
whom
their
own
history
is
interesting
to
whom
young
as
they
may
be
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
be
in
the
world
will
not
i
think
find
the
experience
of
a
boy
born
in
a
very
different
position
from
that
of
most
of
them
yet
as
much
a
boy
as
any
of
them
wearisome
because
ordinary
if
i
did
not
mention
that
i
ranald
bannerman
am
a
scotchman
i
should
be
found
out
before
long
by
the
kind
of
thing
i
have
to
tell
for
although
england
and
scotland
are
in
all
essentials
one
there
are
such
differences
between
them
that
one
could
tell
at
once
on
opening
his
eyes
if
he
had
been
carried
out
of
the
one
into
the
other
during
the
night
i
do
not
mean
he
might
not
be
puzzled
but
except
there
was
an
intention
to
puzzle
him
by
a
skilful
selection
of
place
the
very
air
the
very
colours
would
tell
him
or
if
he
kept
his
eyes
shut
his
ears
would
tell
him
without
his
eyes
but
i
will
not
offend
fastidious
ears
with
any
syllable
of
my
rougher
tongue
i
will
tell
my
story
in
english
and
neither
part
of
the
country
will
like
it
the
worse
for
that
i
will
clear
the
way
for
it
by
mentioning
that
my
father
was
the
clergyman
of
a
country
parish
in
the
north
of
scotland
a
humble
position
involving
plain
living
and
plain
ways
altogether
there
was
a
glebe
or
attached
to
the
manse
or
clergyman
s
house
and
my
father
rented
a
small
farm
besides
for
he
needed
all
he
could
make
by
farming
to
supplement
the
smallness
of
the
living
my
mother
was
an
invalid
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
we
were
four
boys
and
had
no
sister
but
i
must
begin
at
the
beginning
that
is
as
far
back
as
it
is
possible
for
me
to
begin
chapter
ii
the
glimmer
of
twilight
i
can
not
tell
any
better
than
most
of
my
readers
how
and
when
i
began
to
come
awake
or
what
it
was
that
wakened
me
i
mean
i
can
not
remember
when
i
began
to
remember
or
what
first
got
set
down
in
my
memory
as
worth
remembering
sometimes
i
fancy
it
must
have
been
a
tremendous
flood
that
first
made
me
wonder
and
so
made
me
begin
to
remember
at
all
events
i
do
remember
one
flood
that
seems
about
as
far
off
as
anything
the
rain
pouring
so
thick
that
i
put
out
my
hand
in
front
of
me
to
try
whether
i
could
see
it
through
the
veil
of
the
falling
water
the
river
which
in
general
was
to
be
seen
only
in
glimpses
from
the
house
for
it
ran
at
the
bottom
of
a
hollow
was
outspread
like
a
sea
in
front
and
stretched
away
far
on
either
hand
it
was
a
little
stream
but
it
fills
so
much
of
my
memory
with
its
regular
recurrence
of
autumnal
floods
that
i
can
have
no
confidence
that
one
of
these
is
in
reality
the
oldest
thing
i
remember
indeed
i
have
a
suspicion
that
my
oldest
memories
are
of
dreams
where
or
when
dreamed
the
good
one
who
made
me
only
knows
they
are
very
vague
to
me
now
but
were
almost
all
made
up
of
bright
things
one
only
i
can
recall
and
it
i
will
relate
or
more
properly
describe
for
there
was
hardly
anything
done
in
it
i
dreamed
it
often
it
was
of
the
room
i
slept
in
only
it
was
narrower
in
the
dream
and
loftier
and
the
window
was
gone
but
the
ceiling
was
a
ceiling
indeed
for
the
sun
moon
and
stars
lived
there
the
sun
was
not
a
scientific
sun
at
all
but
one
such
as
you
see
in
penny
a
round
jolly
jocund
man
s
face
with
flashes
of
yellow
frilling
it
all
about
just
what
a
grand
sunflower
would
look
if
you
set
a
countenance
where
the
black
seeds
are
and
the
moon
was
just
such
a
one
as
you
may
see
the
cow
jumping
over
in
the
pictured
nursery
rhyme
she
was
a
crescent
of
course
that
she
might
have
a
face
drawn
in
the
hollow
and
turned
towards
the
sun
who
seemed
to
be
her
husband
he
looked
merrily
at
her
and
she
looked
trustfully
at
him
and
i
knew
that
they
got
on
very
well
together
the
stars
were
their
children
of
course
and
they
seemed
to
run
about
the
ceiling
just
as
they
pleased
but
the
sun
and
the
moon
had
regular
motions
rose
and
set
at
the
proper
times
for
they
were
steady
old
folks
i
do
not
however
remember
ever
seeing
them
rise
or
set
they
were
always
up
and
near
the
centre
before
the
dream
dawned
on
me
it
would
always
come
in
one
way
i
thought
i
awoke
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
lo
there
was
the
room
with
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
at
their
pranks
and
revels
in
the
ceiling
sun
nodding
and
smiling
across
the
intervening
space
to
mrs
moon
and
she
nodding
back
to
him
with
a
knowing
look
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
drawn
down
i
have
vague
memories
of
having
heard
them
talk
at
times
i
feel
as
if
i
could
yet
recall
something
of
what
they
said
but
it
vanishes
the
moment
i
try
to
catch
it
it
was
very
queer
talk
indeed
about
me
i
fancied
but
a
thread
of
strong
sense
ran
through
it
all
when
the
dream
had
been
very
vivid
i
would
sometimes
think
of
it
in
the
middle
of
the
next
day
and
look
up
to
the
sun
saying
to
myself
he
s
up
there
now
busy
enough
i
wonder
what
he
is
seeing
to
talk
to
his
wife
about
when
he
comes
down
at
night
i
think
it
sometimes
made
me
a
little
more
careful
of
my
conduct
when
the
sun
set
i
thought
he
was
going
in
the
back
way
and
when
the
moon
rose
i
thought
she
was
going
out
for
a
little
stroll
until
i
should
go
to
sleep
when
they
might
come
and
talk
about
me
again
it
was
odd
that
although
i
never
fancied
it
of
the
sun
i
thought
i
could
make
the
moon
follow
me
as
i
pleased
i
remember
once
my
eldest
brother
giving
me
great
offence
by
bursting
into
laughter
when
i
offered
in
all
seriousness
to
bring
her
to
the
other
side
of
the
house
where
they
wanted
light
to
go
on
with
something
they
were
about
but
i
must
return
to
my
dream
for
the
most
remarkable
thing
in
it
i
have
not
yet
told
you
in
one
corner
of
the
ceiling
there
was
a
hole
and
through
that
hole
came
down
a
ladder
of
very
bright
and
lovely
where
it
came
from
i
never
thought
but
of
course
it
could
not
come
from
the
sun
because
there
he
was
with
his
bright
coat
off
playing
the
father
of
his
family
in
the
most
homely
fashion
possible
that
it
was
a
ladder
of
rays
there
could
however
be
no
doubt
if
only
i
could
climb
upon
it
i
often
tried
but
fast
as
i
lifted
my
feet
to
climb
down
they
came
again
upon
the
boards
of
the
floor
at
length
i
did
succeed
but
this
time
the
dream
had
a
setting
illustration
i
have
said
that
we
were
four
boys
but
at
this
time
we
were
five
there
was
a
little
baby
he
was
very
ill
however
and
i
knew
he
was
not
expected
to
live
i
remember
looking
out
of
my
bed
one
night
and
seeing
my
mother
bending
over
him
in
her
lap
it
is
one
of
the
few
things
in
which
i
do
remember
my
mother
i
fell
asleep
but
by
and
by
woke
and
looked
out
again
no
one
was
there
not
only
were
mother
and
baby
gone
but
the
cradle
was
gone
too
i
knew
that
my
little
brother
was
dead
i
did
not
cry
i
was
too
young
and
ignorant
to
cry
about
it
i
went
to
sleep
again
and
seemed
to
wake
once
more
but
it
was
into
my
dream
this
time
there
were
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
but
the
sun
and
the
moon
had
got
close
together
and
were
talking
very
earnestly
and
all
the
stars
had
gathered
round
them
i
could
not
hear
a
word
they
said
but
i
concluded
that
they
were
talking
about
my
little
brother
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
sorry
i
said
to
myself
and
i
tried
hard
but
i
could
not
feel
sorry
meantime
i
observed
a
curious
motion
in
the
heavenly
host
they
kept
looking
at
me
and
then
at
the
corner
where
the
ladder
stood
and
talking
on
for
i
saw
their
lips
moving
very
fast
and
i
thought
by
the
motion
of
them
that
they
were
saying
something
about
the
ladder
i
got
out
of
bed
and
went
to
it
if
i
could
only
get
up
it
i
would
try
once
more
to
my
delight
i
found
it
would
bear
me
i
climbed
and
climbed
and
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
looked
more
and
more
pleased
as
i
got
up
nearer
to
them
till
at
last
the
sun
s
face
was
in
a
broad
smile
but
they
did
not
move
from
their
places
and
my
head
rose
above
them
and
got
out
at
the
hole
where
the
ladder
came
in
what
i
saw
there
i
can
not
tell
i
only
know
that
a
wind
such
as
had
never
blown
upon
me
in
my
waking
hours
blew
upon
me
now
i
did
not
care
much
for
kisses
then
for
i
had
not
learned
how
good
they
are
but
somehow
i
fancied
afterwards
that
the
wind
was
made
of
my
baby
brother
s
kisses
and
i
began
to
love
the
little
man
who
had
lived
only
long
enough
to
be
our
brother
and
get
up
above
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
by
the
ladder
of
but
this
i
say
i
thought
afterwards
now
all
that
i
can
remember
of
my
dream
is
that
i
began
to
weep
for
very
delight
of
something
i
have
forgotten
and
that
i
fell
down
the
ladder
into
the
room
again
and
awoke
as
one
always
does
with
a
fall
in
a
dream
sun
moon
and
stars
were
gone
the
ladder
of
light
had
vanished
and
i
lay
sobbing
on
my
pillow
i
have
taken
up
a
great
deal
of
room
with
this
story
of
a
dream
but
it
clung
to
me
and
would
often
return
and
then
the
time
of
life
to
which
this
chapter
refers
is
all
so
like
one
that
a
dream
comes
in
well
enough
in
it
there
is
a
twilight
of
the
mind
when
all
things
are
strange
and
when
the
memory
is
only
beginning
to
know
that
it
has
got
a
notebook
and
must
put
things
down
in
it
it
was
not
long
after
this
before
my
mother
died
and
i
was
sorrier
for
my
father
than
for
myself
he
looked
so
sad
i
have
said
that
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
she
was
an
invalid
hence
she
was
unable
to
be
much
with
us
she
is
very
beautiful
in
my
memory
but
during
the
last
months
of
her
life
we
seldom
saw
her
and
the
desire
to
keep
the
house
quiet
for
her
sake
must
have
been
the
beginning
of
that
freedom
which
we
enjoyed
during
the
whole
of
our
boyhood
so
we
were
out
every
day
and
all
day
long
finding
our
meals
when
we
pleased
and
that
as
i
shall
explain
without
going
home
for
them
i
remember
her
death
clearly
but
i
will
not
dwell
upon
that
it
is
too
sad
to
write
much
about
though
she
was
happy
and
the
least
troubled
of
us
all
her
sole
concern
was
at
leaving
her
husband
and
children
but
the
will
of
god
was
a
better
thing
to
her
than
to
live
with
them
my
sorrow
at
least
was
soon
over
for
god
makes
children
so
that
grief
can
not
cleave
to
them
they
must
not
begin
life
with
a
burden
of
loss
he
knows
it
is
only
for
a
time
when
i
see
my
mother
again
she
will
not
reproach
me
that
my
tears
were
so
soon
dried
little
one
i
think
i
hear
her
saying
how
could
you
go
on
crying
for
your
poor
mother
when
god
was
mothering
you
all
the
time
and
breathing
life
into
you
and
making
the
world
a
blessed
place
for
you
you
will
tell
me
all
about
it
some
yes
and
we
shall
tell
our
mothers
shall
we
not
how
sorry
we
are
that
we
ever
gave
them
any
trouble
sometimes
we
were
very
naughty
and
sometimes
we
did
not
know
better
my
mother
was
very
good
but
i
can
not
remember
a
single
one
of
the
many
kisses
she
must
have
given
me
i
remember
her
holding
my
head
to
her
bosom
when
she
was
dying
that
is
all
chapter
iii
my
father
my
father
was
a
tall
staid
solemn
man
who
walked
slowly
with
long
strides
he
spoke
very
little
and
generally
looked
as
if
he
were
pondering
next
sunday
s
sermon
his
head
was
grey
and
a
little
bent
as
if
he
were
gathering
truth
from
the
ground
once
i
came
upon
him
in
the
garden
standing
with
his
face
up
to
heaven
and
i
thought
he
was
seeing
something
in
the
clouds
but
when
i
came
nearer
i
saw
that
his
eyes
were
closed
and
it
made
me
feel
very
solemn
i
crept
away
as
if
i
had
been
peeping
where
i
ought
not
he
did
not
talk
much
to
us
what
he
said
was
very
gentle
and
it
seemed
to
me
it
was
his
solemnity
that
made
him
gentle
i
have
seen
him
look
very
angry
he
used
to
walk
much
about
his
fields
especially
of
a
summer
morning
before
the
sun
was
up
this
was
after
my
mother
s
death
i
presume
he
felt
nearer
to
her
in
the
fields
than
in
the
house
there
was
a
kind
of
grandeur
about
him
i
am
sure
for
i
never
saw
one
of
his
parishioners
salute
him
in
the
road
without
a
look
of
my
father
himself
passing
like
a
solemn
cloud
over
the
face
of
the
man
or
woman
for
us
we
feared
and
loved
him
both
at
once
i
do
not
remember
ever
being
punished
by
him
but
kirsty
of
whom
i
shall
have
to
speak
by
and
by
has
told
me
that
he
did
punish
us
when
we
were
very
small
children
neither
did
he
teach
us
much
himself
except
on
the
occasions
i
am
about
to
mention
and
i
can
not
say
that
i
learned
much
from
his
sermons
these
gave
entire
satisfaction
to
those
of
his
parishioners
whom
i
happened
to
hear
speak
of
them
but
although
i
loved
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
liked
to
look
at
his
face
as
he
stood
up
there
in
the
ancient
pulpit
clad
in
his
gown
and
bands
i
never
cared
much
about
what
he
said
of
course
it
was
all
right
and
a
better
sermon
than
any
other
clergyman
whatever
could
have
preached
but
what
it
was
all
about
was
of
no
consequence
to
me
i
may
as
well
confess
at
once
that
i
never
had
the
least
doubt
that
my
father
was
the
best
man
in
the
world
nay
to
this
very
hour
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
notwithstanding
that
the
son
of
the
village
tailor
once
gave
me
a
tremendous
thrashing
for
saying
so
on
the
ground
that
i
was
altogether
wrong
seeing
father
was
the
best
man
in
the
world
at
least
i
have
learned
to
modify
the
assertion
only
to
this
extent
that
my
father
was
the
best
man
i
have
ever
known
the
church
was
a
very
old
one
had
seen
candles
burning
heard
the
little
bell
ringing
and
smelt
the
incense
of
the
old
catholic
service
it
was
so
old
that
it
seemed
settling
down
again
into
the
earth
especially
on
one
side
where
great
buttresses
had
been
built
to
keep
it
up
it
leaned
against
them
like
a
weary
old
thing
that
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
it
had
a
short
square
tower
like
so
many
of
the
churches
in
england
and
although
there
was
but
one
old
cracked
bell
in
it
although
there
was
no
organ
to
give
out
its
glorious
sounds
although
there
was
neither
chanting
nor
responses
i
assure
my
english
readers
that
the
awe
and
reverence
which
fell
upon
me
as
i
crossed
its
worn
threshold
were
nowise
inferior
as
far
as
i
can
judge
to
the
awe
and
respect
they
feel
when
they
enter
the
more
beautiful
churches
of
their
country
there
was
a
hush
in
it
which
demanded
a
refraining
of
the
foot
a
treading
softly
as
upon
holy
ground
and
the
church
was
inseparably
associated
with
my
father
the
pew
we
sat
in
was
a
square
one
with
a
table
in
the
middle
of
it
for
our
books
my
brother
david
generally
used
it
for
laying
his
head
upon
that
he
might
go
to
sleep
comfortably
my
brother
tom
put
his
feet
on
the
of
it
leaned
back
in
his
corner
for
you
see
we
had
a
corner
apiece
put
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
stared
hard
at
my
father
for
tom
s
corner
was
well
in
front
of
the
pulpit
my
brother
allister
whose
back
was
to
the
pulpit
used
to
learn
the
all
the
time
of
the
sermon
i
happiest
of
all
in
my
position
could
look
up
at
my
father
if
i
pleased
a
little
sideways
or
if
i
preferred
which
i
confess
i
often
did
study
a
rare
sight
in
scotch
churches
the
figure
of
an
armed
knight
carved
in
stone
which
lay
on
the
top
of
the
tomb
of
sir
worm
wymble
at
least
that
is
the
nearest
i
can
come
to
the
spelling
of
the
name
they
gave
him
the
tomb
was
close
by
the
side
of
the
pew
with
only
a
flagged
passage
between
it
stood
in
a
hollow
in
the
wall
and
the
knight
lay
under
the
arch
of
the
recess
so
silent
so
patient
with
folded
palms
as
if
praying
for
some
help
which
he
could
not
name
from
the
presence
of
this
labour
of
the
sculptor
came
a
certain
element
into
the
feeling
of
the
place
which
it
could
not
otherwise
have
possessed
organ
and
chant
were
not
altogether
needful
while
that
carved
knight
lay
there
with
face
upturned
as
if
looking
to
heaven
illustration
but
from
gazing
at
the
knight
i
began
to
regard
the
wall
about
him
and
the
arch
over
him
and
from
the
arch
my
eye
would
seek
the
roof
and
descending
rest
on
the
pillars
or
wander
about
the
windows
searching
the
building
of
the
place
discovering
the
points
of
its
strength
and
how
it
was
upheld
so
that
while
my
father
was
talking
of
the
church
as
a
company
of
believers
and
describing
how
it
was
held
together
by
faith
i
was
trying
to
understand
how
the
stone
and
lime
of
the
old
place
was
kept
from
falling
asunder
and
thus
beginning
to
follow
what
has
become
my
profession
since
for
i
am
an
architect
but
the
church
has
led
me
away
from
my
father
he
always
spoke
in
rather
a
low
voice
but
so
earnestly
that
every
eye
as
it
seemed
to
me
but
mine
and
those
of
two
of
my
brothers
was
fixed
upon
him
i
think
however
that
it
was
in
part
the
fault
of
certain
teaching
of
his
own
better
fitted
for
our
understanding
that
we
paid
so
little
heed
even
tom
with
all
his
staring
knew
as
little
about
the
sermon
as
any
of
us
but
my
father
did
not
question
us
much
concerning
it
he
did
what
was
far
better
on
sunday
afternoons
in
the
warm
peaceful
sunlight
of
summer
with
the
honeysuckle
filling
the
air
of
the
little
arbour
in
which
we
sat
and
his
one
glass
of
wine
set
on
the
table
in
the
middle
he
would
sit
for
an
hour
talking
away
to
us
in
his
gentle
slow
deep
voice
telling
us
story
after
story
out
of
the
new
testament
and
explaining
them
in
a
way
i
have
seldom
heard
equalled
or
in
the
cold
winter
nights
he
would
come
into
the
room
where
i
and
my
two
younger
brothers
slept
the
nursery
it
was
and
sitting
down
with
tom
by
his
side
before
the
fire
that
burned
bright
in
the
frosty
air
would
open
the
great
family
bible
on
the
table
turn
his
face
towards
the
two
beds
where
we
three
lay
wide
awake
and
tell
us
story
after
story
out
of
the
old
testament
sometimes
reading
a
few
verses
sometimes
turning
the
bare
facts
into
an
expanded
and
illustrated
narrative
of
his
own
which
in
shakspere
fashion
he
presented
after
the
modes
and
ways
of
our
own
country
and
time
i
shall
never
forget
joseph
in
egypt
hearing
the
pattering
of
the
asses
hoofs
in
the
street
and
throwing
up
the
window
and
looking
out
and
seeing
all
his
own
brothers
coming
riding
towards
him
or
the
grand
rush
of
the
sea
waves
over
the
bewildered
hosts
of
the
egyptians
we
lay
and
listened
with
all
the
more
enjoyment
that
while
the
fire
was
burning
so
brightly
and
the
presence
of
my
father
filling
the
room
with
safety
and
peace
the
wind
was
howling
outside
and
the
snow
drifting
up
against
the
window
sometimes
i
passed
into
the
land
of
sleep
with
his
voice
in
my
ears
and
his
love
in
my
heart
perhaps
into
the
land
of
visions
once
certainly
into
a
dream
of
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
making
obeisance
to
the
son
of
jacob
chapter
iv
kirsty
my
father
had
a
housekeeper
a
trusty
woman
he
considered
her
we
thought
her
old
i
suppose
she
was
about
forty
she
was
not
pleasant
for
she
was
and
censorious
with
a
very
straight
back
and
a
very
long
upper
lip
indeed
the
distance
from
her
nose
to
her
mouth
was
greater
than
the
length
of
her
nose
when
i
think
of
her
first
it
is
always
as
making
some
complaint
to
my
father
against
us
perhaps
she
meant
to
speak
the
truth
or
rather
perhaps
took
it
for
granted
that
she
always
did
speak
the
truth
but
certainly
she
would
exaggerate
things
and
give
them
quite
another
look
the
bones
of
her
story
might
be
true
but
she
would
put
a
skin
over
it
after
her
own
fashion
which
was
not
one
of
mildness
and
charity
the
consequence
was
that
the
older
we
grew
the
more
our
minds
were
alienated
from
her
and
the
more
we
came
to
regard
her
as
our
enemy
if
she
really
meant
to
be
our
friend
after
the
best
fashion
she
knew
it
was
at
least
an
uncomely
kind
of
friendship
that
showed
itself
in
constant
opposition
and
complaint
the
real
mistake
was
that
we
were
boys
there
was
something
in
her
altogether
antagonistic
to
the
you
would
have
thought
that
to
be
a
boy
was
in
her
eyes
to
be
something
wrong
to
begin
with
that
boys
ought
never
to
have
been
made
that
they
must
always
by
their
very
nature
be
about
something
amiss
i
have
occasionally
wondered
how
she
would
have
behaved
to
a
girl
on
reflection
i
think
a
little
better
but
the
girl
would
have
been
worse
off
because
she
could
not
have
escaped
from
her
as
we
did
my
father
would
hear
her
complaints
to
the
end
without
putting
in
a
word
except
it
were
to
ask
her
a
question
and
when
she
had
finished
would
turn
again
to
his
book
or
his
sermon
saying
very
well
mitchell
i
will
speak
to
them
about
my
impression
is
that
he
did
not
believe
the
half
she
told
him
at
all
events
when
he
had
sent
for
us
he
would
ask
our
version
of
the
affair
and
listen
to
that
as
he
had
listened
to
hers
then
he
would
set
forth
to
us
where
we
had
been
wrong
if
we
were
wrong
and
send
us
away
with
an
injunction
not
to
provoke
mitchell
who
couldn
t
help
being
short
in
her
temper
poor
thing
somehow
or
other
we
got
it
into
our
heads
that
the
shortness
of
her
temper
was
mysteriously
associated
with
the
shortness
of
her
nose
she
was
saving
even
to
stinginess
she
would
do
her
best
to
provide
what
my
father
liked
but
for
us
she
thought
almost
anything
good
enough
she
would
for
instance
give
us
the
thinnest
of
milk
we
said
she
skimmed
it
three
times
before
she
thought
it
blue
enough
for
us
my
two
younger
brothers
did
not
mind
it
so
much
as
i
did
for
i
was
always
rather
delicate
and
if
i
took
a
dislike
to
anything
would
rather
go
without
than
eat
or
drink
of
it
but
i
have
told
you
enough
about
her
to
make
it
plain
that
she
could
be
no
favourite
with
us
and
enough
likewise
to
serve
as
a
background
to
my
description
of
kirsty
kirsty
was
a
highland
woman
who
had
the
charge
of
the
house
in
which
the
farm
servants
lived
she
was
a
cheerful
gracious
kind
woman
a
woman
of
god
s
making
one
would
say
were
it
not
that
however
mysterious
it
may
look
we
can
not
deny
that
he
made
mitchell
too
it
is
very
puzzling
i
confess
i
remember
once
that
my
youngest
brother
davie
a
very
little
fellow
then
for
he
could
not
speak
plainly
came
running
in
great
distress
to
kirsty
crying
fee
fee
by
which
he
meant
to
indicate
that
a
flea
was
rendering
his
life
miserable
kirsty
at
once
undressed
him
and
entered
on
the
pursuit
after
a
successful
search
while
she
was
putting
on
his
garments
again
little
davie
who
had
been
looking
very
solemn
and
thoughtful
for
some
time
said
not
in
a
questioning
but
in
a
concluding
tone
god
didn
t
make
the
fees
kirsty
oh
yes
davie
god
made
everything
god
did
make
the
fleas
said
kirsty
davie
was
silent
for
a
while
then
he
opened
his
mouth
and
spake
like
a
discontented
prophet
of
old
why
doesn
t
he
give
them
something
else
to
eat
then
you
must
ask
himself
that
said
kirsty
with
a
wisdom
i
have
since
learned
to
comprehend
though
i
remember
it
shocked
me
a
little
at
the
time
all
this
set
me
thinking
before
the
dressing
of
little
davie
was
over
i
had
question
to
put
to
kirsty
it
was
in
fact
the
same
question
only
with
a
more
important
object
in
the
eye
of
it
i
suppose
god
made
mitchell
as
well
as
you
and
the
rest
of
us
kirsty
i
said
certainly
ranald
returned
kirsty
well
i
wish
he
hadn
t
was
my
remark
in
which
i
only
imitated
my
baby
brother
who
was
always
much
cleverer
than
i
oh
she
s
not
a
bad
sort
said
kirsty
though
i
must
say
if
i
was
her
i
would
try
to
be
a
little
more
to
return
to
kirsty
she
was
our
constant
resort
the
farmhouse
was
a
furlong
or
so
from
the
manse
but
with
the
blood
pouring
from
a
cut
finger
the
feet
would
of
themselves
devour
that
furlong
rather
than
apply
to
mitchell
oh
she
was
dear
and
good
and
kind
our
kirsty
in
person
she
was
short
and
slender
with
keen
blue
eyes
and
dark
hair
an
uncommonly
small
foot
which
she
claimed
for
all
highland
folk
a
light
step
a
sweet
voice
and
a
most
bounteous
hand
but
there
i
come
into
the
moral
nature
of
her
for
it
is
the
mind
that
makes
the
hand
bountiful
for
her
face
i
think
that
was
rather
queer
but
in
truth
i
can
hardly
tell
so
entirely
was
it
the
sign
of
good
to
me
and
my
brothers
in
short
i
loved
her
so
much
that
i
do
not
know
now
even
as
i
did
not
care
then
whether
she
was
or
not
she
was
quite
as
old
as
mitchell
but
we
never
thought
of
being
old
she
was
our
refuge
in
all
time
of
trouble
and
necessity
it
was
she
who
gave
us
something
to
eat
as
often
and
as
much
as
we
wanted
she
used
to
say
it
was
no
cheating
of
the
minister
to
feed
the
minister
s
boys
and
then
her
stories
there
was
nothing
like
them
in
all
that
countryside
it
was
rather
a
dreary
country
in
outward
aspect
having
many
bleak
moorland
hills
that
lay
about
like
waves
of
no
great
height
but
of
much
desolation
and
as
far
as
the
imagination
was
concerned
it
would
seem
that
the
minds
of
former
generations
had
been
as
bleak
as
the
country
they
had
left
such
small
store
of
legends
of
any
sort
but
kirsty
had
come
from
a
region
where
the
hills
were
hills
indeed
hills
with
mighty
skeletons
of
stone
inside
them
hills
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
heaped
over
huge
monsters
which
were
ever
trying
to
get
up
a
country
where
every
cliff
and
rock
and
well
had
its
story
and
kirsty
s
head
was
full
of
such
it
was
delight
indeed
to
sit
by
her
fire
and
listen
to
them
that
would
be
after
the
men
had
had
their
supper
early
of
a
winter
night
and
had
gone
two
of
them
to
the
village
and
the
other
to
attend
to
the
horses
then
we
and
the
herd
as
we
called
the
boy
who
attended
to
the
cattle
whose
work
was
over
for
the
night
would
sit
by
the
fire
and
kirsty
would
tell
us
stories
and
we
were
in
our
heaven
chapter
v
i
begin
life
i
began
life
and
that
after
no
pleasant
fashion
as
near
as
i
can
guess
about
the
age
of
six
years
one
glorious
morning
in
early
summer
i
found
myself
led
by
the
ungentle
hand
of
mitchell
towards
a
little
school
on
the
outside
of
the
village
kept
by
an
old
woman
called
shand
in
an
english
village
i
think
she
would
have
been
called
dame
shand
we
called
her
luckie
shand
half
dragged
along
the
road
by
mitchell
from
whose
rough
grasp
i
attempted
in
vain
to
extricate
my
hand
i
looked
around
at
the
shining
fields
and
up
at
the
blue
sky
where
a
lark
was
singing
as
if
he
had
just
found
out
that
he
could
sing
with
something
like
the
despair
of
a
man
going
to
the
gallows
and
bidding
farewell
to
the
world
we
had
to
cross
a
little
stream
and
when
we
reached
the
middle
of
the
i
tugged
yet
again
at
my
imprisoned
hand
with
a
intention
of
throwing
myself
into
the
brook
but
my
efforts
were
still
unavailing
over
a
or
so
rendered
weary
by
unwillingness
i
was
led
to
the
cottage
door
no
such
cottage
as
some
of
my
readers
will
picture
with
roses
and
honeysuckle
hiding
its
walls
but
a
dreary
little
house
with
nothing
green
to
cover
the
brown
stones
of
which
it
was
built
and
having
an
open
ditch
in
front
of
it
with
a
stone
slab
over
it
for
a
bridge
did
i
say
there
was
nothing
on
the
walls
this
morning
there
was
the
loveliest
sunshine
and
that
i
was
going
to
leave
behind
it
was
very
bitter
especially
as
i
had
expected
to
go
with
my
elder
brother
to
spend
the
day
at
a
neighbouring
farm
mitchell
opened
the
door
and
led
me
in
it
was
an
awful
experience
dame
shand
stood
at
her
table
ironing
she
was
as
tall
as
mitchell
and
that
was
enough
to
prejudice
me
against
her
at
once
she
wore
a
widow
s
cap
with
a
black
ribbon
round
it
her
hair
was
grey
and
her
face
was
as
grey
as
her
hair
and
her
skin
was
gathered
in
wrinkles
about
her
mouth
where
they
twitched
and
twitched
as
if
she
were
constantly
meditating
something
unpleasant
she
looked
up
inquiringly
i
ve
brought
you
a
new
scholar
said
mitchell
well
very
well
said
the
dame
in
a
dubious
tone
i
hope
he
s
a
good
boy
for
he
must
be
good
if
he
comes
well
he
s
just
middling
his
father
spares
the
rod
shand
and
we
know
what
comes
of
they
went
on
with
their
talk
which
as
far
as
i
can
recall
it
was
complimentary
to
none
but
the
two
women
themselves
meantime
i
was
making
what
observations
my
terror
would
allow
about
a
dozen
children
were
seated
on
forms
along
the
walls
looking
over
the
tops
of
their
at
the
newcomer
in
the
farther
corner
two
were
kicking
at
each
other
as
opportunity
offered
looking
very
angry
but
not
daring
to
cry
my
next
discovery
was
terribly
disconcerting
some
movement
drew
my
eyes
to
the
floor
there
i
saw
a
boy
of
my
own
age
on
fastened
by
a
string
to
a
leg
of
the
table
at
which
the
dame
was
ironing
while
horrible
to
relate
a
dog
not
very
big
but
very
ugly
and
big
enough
to
be
frightened
at
lay
under
the
table
watching
him
i
gazed
in
utter
dismay
ah
you
may
look
said
the
dame
if
you
re
not
a
good
boy
that
is
how
you
shall
be
served
the
dog
shall
have
you
to
look
i
trembled
and
was
speechless
after
some
further
confabulation
mitchell
took
her
leave
saying
i
ll
come
back
for
him
at
one
o
clock
and
if
i
don
t
come
just
keep
him
till
i
do
the
dame
accompanied
her
to
the
door
and
then
i
discovered
that
she
was
lame
and
hobbled
very
much
a
resolution
arose
in
my
brain
i
sat
down
on
the
form
near
the
door
and
kept
very
quiet
had
it
not
been
for
the
intention
i
cherished
i
am
sure
i
should
have
cried
when
the
dame
returned
she
resumed
her
in
which
the
heater
went
rattling
about
as
standing
on
one
leg
the
other
was
so
much
shorter
she
moved
it
to
and
fro
over
the
garment
on
the
table
then
she
called
me
to
her
by
name
in
a
pompous
manner
i
obeyed
trembling
can
you
say
your
letters
she
asked
now
although
i
could
not
read
i
could
repeat
the
alphabet
how
i
had
learned
it
i
do
not
know
i
did
repeat
it
how
many
questions
of
your
catechism
can
you
say
she
asked
next
not
knowing
with
certainty
what
she
meant
i
was
silent
no
sulking
said
the
dame
and
opening
a
drawer
in
the
table
she
took
out
a
catechism
turning
back
the
cover
she
put
it
in
my
hand
and
told
me
to
learn
the
first
question
she
had
not
even
inquired
whether
i
could
read
i
took
the
catechism
and
stood
as
before
go
to
your
seat
she
said
i
obeyed
and
with
the
book
before
me
pondered
my
plan
everything
depended
on
whether
i
could
open
the
door
before
she
could
reach
me
once
out
of
the
house
i
was
sure
of
running
faster
than
she
could
follow
and
soon
i
had
my
first
experience
of
how
those
are
helped
who
will
help
themselves
the
ironing
of
course
required
a
fire
to
make
the
irons
hot
and
as
the
morning
went
on
the
sunshine
on
the
walls
conspiring
with
the
fire
on
the
hearth
made
the
place
too
hot
for
the
comfort
of
the
old
dame
she
went
and
set
the
door
wide
open
i
was
instantly
on
the
alert
watching
for
an
opportunity
one
soon
occurred
a
class
of
some
five
or
six
was
reading
if
reading
it
could
be
called
out
of
the
bible
at
length
it
came
to
the
turn
of
one
who
blundered
dreadfully
it
was
the
same
boy
who
had
been
tied
under
the
table
but
he
had
been
released
for
his
lesson
the
dame
hobbled
to
him
and
found
he
had
his
book
upside
down
whereupon
she
turned
in
wrath
to
the
table
and
took
from
the
drawer
a
long
leather
strap
with
which
she
proceeded
to
chastise
him
as
his
first
cry
reached
my
ears
i
was
halfway
to
the
door
on
the
threshold
i
stumbled
and
fell
the
new
boy
s
running
away
shrieked
some
little
sycophant
inside
i
heard
with
horror
but
i
was
up
and
off
in
a
moment
i
had
not
however
got
many
yards
from
the
cottage
before
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
dame
screaming
after
me
to
return
i
took
no
heed
only
sped
the
faster
but
what
was
my
horror
to
find
her
command
enforced
by
the
pursuing
bark
of
her
prime
minister
this
paralysed
me
i
turned
and
there
was
the
dog
close
on
my
heels
i
could
run
no
longer
for
one
moment
i
felt
as
if
i
should
sink
to
the
earth
for
sheer
terror
the
next
moment
a
wholesome
rage
sent
the
blood
to
my
brain
from
abject
cowardice
to
wild
attack
i
can
not
call
it
courage
was
the
change
of
an
instant
i
rushed
towards
the
little
wretch
i
did
not
know
how
to
fight
him
but
in
desperation
i
threw
myself
upon
him
and
dug
my
nails
into
him
they
had
fortunately
found
their
way
to
his
eyes
he
was
the
veriest
coward
of
his
species
he
yelped
and
howled
and
struggling
from
my
grasp
ran
with
his
tail
merged
in
his
person
back
to
his
mistress
who
was
hobbling
after
me
but
with
the
renewed
strength
of
triumph
i
turned
again
for
home
and
ran
as
i
had
never
run
before
when
or
where
the
dame
gave
in
i
do
not
know
i
never
turned
my
head
until
i
laid
it
on
kirsty
s
bosom
and
there
i
burst
out
sobbing
and
crying
it
was
all
the
utterance
i
had
left
as
soon
as
kirsty
had
succeeded
in
calming
me
i
told
her
the
whole
story
she
said
very
little
but
i
could
see
she
was
very
angry
no
doubt
she
was
pondering
what
could
be
done
she
got
me
some
milk
half
cream
i
do
believe
it
was
so
nice
and
some
oatcake
and
went
on
with
her
work
while
i
ate
i
reflected
that
any
moment
mitchell
might
appear
to
drag
me
back
in
disgrace
to
that
horrible
den
i
knew
that
kirsty
s
authority
was
not
equal
to
hers
and
that
she
would
be
compelled
to
give
me
up
so
i
watched
an
opportunity
to
escape
once
more
and
hide
myself
so
that
kirsty
might
be
able
to
say
she
did
not
know
where
i
was
when
i
had
finished
and
kirsty
had
left
the
kitchen
for
a
moment
i
sped
noiselessly
to
the
door
and
looked
out
into
the
farmyard
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
dark
and
brown
and
cool
the
door
of
the
barn
stood
open
as
if
inviting
me
to
shelter
and
safety
for
i
knew
that
in
the
darkest
end
of
it
lay
a
great
heap
of
i
sped
across
the
intervening
sunshine
into
the
darkness
and
began
burrowing
in
the
straw
like
a
wild
animal
drawing
out
handfuls
and
laying
them
carefully
aside
so
that
no
disorder
should
betray
my
retreat
when
i
had
made
a
hole
large
enough
to
hold
me
i
got
in
but
kept
drawing
out
the
straw
behind
me
and
filling
the
hole
in
front
this
i
continued
until
i
had
not
only
stopped
up
the
entrance
but
placed
a
good
thickness
of
straw
between
me
and
the
outside
by
the
time
i
had
burrowed
as
far
as
i
thought
necessary
i
was
tired
and
lay
down
at
full
length
in
my
hole
delighting
in
such
a
sense
of
safety
as
i
had
never
before
experienced
i
was
soon
fast
asleep
chapter
vi
no
father
illustration
i
woke
and
creeping
out
of
my
lair
and
peeping
from
the
door
of
the
barn
which
looked
into
the
cornyard
found
that
the
sun
was
going
down
i
had
already
discovered
that
i
was
getting
hungry
i
went
out
at
the
other
door
into
the
close
or
farmyard
and
ran
across
to
the
house
no
one
was
there
something
moved
me
to
climb
on
the
form
and
look
out
of
a
little
window
from
which
i
could
see
the
manse
and
the
road
from
it
to
my
dismay
there
was
mitchell
coming
towards
the
farm
i
possessed
my
wits
sufficiently
to
run
first
to
kirsty
s
press
and
secure
a
good
supply
of
oatcake
with
which
i
then
sped
like
a
hunted
hare
to
her
form
i
had
soon
drawn
the
stopper
of
straw
into
the
mouth
of
the
hole
where
hearing
no
one
approach
i
began
to
eat
my
oatcake
and
fell
asleep
again
before
i
had
finished
and
as
i
slept
i
dreamed
my
dream
the
sun
was
looking
very
grave
and
the
moon
reflected
his
concern
they
were
not
satisfied
with
me
at
length
the
sun
shook
his
head
that
is
his
whole
self
oscillated
on
an
axis
and
the
moon
thereupon
shook
herself
in
response
then
they
nodded
to
each
other
as
much
as
to
say
that
is
entirely
my
own
at
last
they
began
to
talk
not
as
men
converse
but
both
at
once
yet
each
listening
while
each
spoke
i
heard
no
word
but
their
lips
moved
most
busily
their
eyebrows
went
up
and
down
their
eyelids
winked
and
winked
and
their
cheeks
puckered
and
relaxed
incessantly
there
was
an
absolute
storm
of
expression
upon
their
faces
their
very
noses
twisted
and
curled
it
seemed
as
if
in
the
agony
of
their
talk
their
countenances
would
go
to
pieces
for
the
stars
they
darted
about
hither
and
thither
gathered
into
groups
dispersed
and
formed
new
groups
and
having
no
faces
yet
but
being
a
sort
of
celestial
tadpoles
indicated
by
their
motions
alone
that
they
took
an
active
interest
in
the
questions
agitating
their
parents
some
of
them
kept
darting
up
and
down
the
ladder
of
rays
like
phosphorescent
sparks
in
the
sea
foam
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
awoke
i
was
in
darkness
but
not
in
my
own
bed
when
i
proceeded
to
turn
i
found
myself
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
i
could
not
stretch
my
arms
and
there
was
hardly
room
for
my
body
between
my
feet
and
my
head
i
was
dreadfully
frightened
at
first
and
felt
as
if
i
were
being
slowly
stifled
as
my
brain
awoke
i
recalled
the
horrible
school
the
horrible
schoolmistress
and
the
most
horrible
dog
over
whose
defeat
however
i
rejoiced
with
the
pride
of
a
next
i
thought
it
would
be
well
to
look
abroad
and
reconnoitre
once
more
i
drew
away
the
straw
from
the
entrance
to
my
lair
but
what
was
my
dismay
to
find
that
even
when
my
hand
went
out
into
space
no
light
came
through
the
opening
what
could
it
mean
surely
i
had
not
grown
blind
while
i
lay
asleep
hurriedly
i
shot
out
the
remainder
of
the
stopper
of
straw
and
crept
from
the
hole
in
the
great
barn
there
was
but
the
dullest
glimmer
of
light
i
had
almost
said
the
clumsiest
reduction
of
darkness
i
tumbled
at
one
of
the
doors
rather
than
ran
to
it
i
found
it
fast
but
this
one
i
knew
was
fastened
on
the
inside
by
a
wooden
bolt
or
bar
which
i
could
draw
back
the
open
door
revealed
the
dark
night
before
me
was
the
cornyard
as
we
called
it
full
of
ricks
huge
and
very
positive
although
dim
they
rose
betwixt
me
and
the
sky
between
their
tops
i
saw
only
stars
and
darkness
i
turned
and
looked
back
into
the
barn
it
appeared
a
horrible
cave
filled
with
darkness
i
remembered
there
were
rats
in
it
i
dared
not
enter
it
again
even
to
go
out
at
the
opposite
door
i
forgot
how
soundly
and
peacefully
i
had
slept
in
it
i
stepped
out
into
the
night
with
the
grass
of
the
under
my
feet
the
awful
vault
of
heaven
over
my
head
and
those
shadowy
ricks
around
me
it
was
a
relief
to
lay
my
hand
on
one
of
them
and
feel
that
it
was
solid
i
half
groped
my
way
through
them
and
got
out
into
the
open
field
by
creeping
through
between
the
stems
of
what
had
once
been
a
hawthorn
hedge
but
had
in
the
course
of
a
hundred
years
grown
into
the
grimmest
largest
most
grotesque
trees
i
have
ever
seen
of
the
kind
i
had
always
been
a
little
afraid
of
them
even
in
the
daytime
but
they
did
me
no
hurt
and
i
stood
in
the
vast
hall
of
the
silent
night
alone
there
lay
the
awfulness
of
it
i
had
never
before
known
what
the
night
was
the
real
sting
of
its
fear
lay
in
this
that
there
was
nobody
else
in
it
everybody
besides
me
was
asleep
all
over
the
world
and
had
abandoned
me
to
my
fate
whatever
might
come
out
of
the
darkness
to
seize
me
when
i
got
round
the
edge
of
the
stone
wall
which
on
another
side
bounded
the
there
was
the
moon
crescent
as
i
saw
her
in
my
dream
but
low
down
towards
the
horizon
and
lying
almost
upon
her
rounded
back
she
looked
very
disconsolate
and
dim
even
she
would
take
no
heed
of
me
abandoned
child
the
stars
were
high
up
away
in
the
heavens
they
did
not
look
like
the
children
of
the
sun
and
moon
at
all
and
took
no
heed
of
me
yet
there
was
a
grandeur
in
my
desolation
that
would
have
elevated
my
heart
but
for
the
fear
if
i
had
had
one
living
creature
nigh
me
if
only
the
stupid
calf
whose
dull
sleepy
low
startled
me
so
dreadfully
as
i
stood
staring
about
me
it
was
not
dark
out
here
in
the
open
field
for
at
this
season
of
the
year
it
is
not
dark
there
all
night
long
when
the
sky
is
unclouded
away
in
the
north
was
the
great
bear
i
knew
that
constellation
for
by
it
one
of
the
men
had
taught
me
to
find
the
nearly
under
it
was
the
light
of
the
sun
creeping
round
by
the
north
towards
the
spot
in
the
east
where
he
would
rise
again
but
i
learned
only
afterwards
to
understand
this
i
gazed
at
that
pale
faded
light
and
all
at
once
i
remembered
that
god
was
near
me
but
i
did
not
know
what
god
is
then
as
i
know
now
and
when
i
thought
about
him
then
which
was
neither
much
nor
often
my
idea
of
him
was
not
like
him
it
was
merely
a
confused
mixture
of
other
people
s
fancies
about
him
and
my
own
i
had
not
learned
how
beautiful
god
is
i
had
only
learned
that
he
is
strong
i
had
been
told
that
he
was
angry
with
those
that
did
wrong
i
had
not
understood
that
he
loved
them
all
the
time
although
he
was
displeased
with
them
and
must
punish
them
to
make
them
good
when
i
thought
of
him
now
in
the
silent
starry
night
a
yet
greater
terror
seized
me
and
i
ran
stumbling
over
the
uneven
field
does
my
reader
wonder
whither
i
fled
whither
should
i
fly
but
home
true
mitchell
was
there
but
there
was
another
there
as
well
even
kirsty
would
not
do
in
this
terror
home
was
the
only
refuge
for
my
father
was
there
i
sped
for
the
manse
but
as
i
approached
it
a
new
apprehension
laid
hold
of
my
trembling
heart
i
was
not
sure
but
i
thought
the
door
was
always
locked
at
night
i
drew
nearer
the
place
of
possible
refuge
rose
before
me
i
stood
on
the
in
front
of
it
there
was
no
light
in
its
eyes
its
mouth
was
closed
it
was
silent
as
one
of
the
ricks
above
it
shone
the
speechless
stars
nothing
was
alive
nothing
would
speak
i
went
up
the
few
granite
steps
that
led
to
the
door
i
laid
my
hand
on
the
handle
and
gently
turned
it
joy
of
joys
the
door
opened
i
entered
the
hall
ah
it
was
more
silent
than
the
night
no
footsteps
echoed
no
voices
were
there
i
closed
the
door
behind
me
and
almost
sick
with
the
misery
of
a
being
where
no
other
being
was
to
comfort
it
i
groped
my
way
to
my
father
s
room
when
i
once
had
my
hand
on
his
door
the
warm
tide
of
courage
began
again
to
flow
from
my
heart
i
opened
this
door
too
very
quietly
for
was
not
the
dragon
asleep
down
below
papa
papa
i
cried
in
an
eager
whisper
are
you
awake
papa
no
voice
came
in
reply
and
the
place
was
yet
more
silent
than
the
night
or
the
hall
he
must
be
asleep
i
was
afraid
to
call
louder
i
crept
nearer
to
the
bed
i
stretched
out
my
hands
to
feel
for
him
he
must
be
at
the
farther
side
i
climbed
up
on
the
bed
i
felt
all
across
it
utter
desertion
seized
my
soul
my
father
was
not
there
was
it
a
horrible
dream
should
i
ever
awake
my
heart
sank
totally
within
me
i
could
bear
no
more
i
fell
down
on
the
bed
weeping
bitterly
and
wept
myself
asleep
years
after
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
read
jean
paul
s
terrible
dream
that
there
was
no
god
and
the
desolation
of
this
night
was
my
key
to
that
dream
once
more
i
awoke
to
a
sense
of
misery
and
stretched
out
my
arms
crying
papa
papa
the
same
moment
i
found
my
father
s
arms
around
me
he
folded
me
close
to
him
and
said
hush
ranald
my
boy
here
i
am
you
are
quite
i
nestled
as
close
to
him
as
i
could
go
and
wept
for
blessedness
oh
papa
i
sobbed
i
thought
i
had
lost
and
i
thought
i
had
lost
you
my
boy
tell
me
all
about
between
my
narrative
and
my
replies
to
his
questionings
he
had
soon
gathered
the
whole
story
and
i
in
my
turn
learned
the
dismay
of
the
household
when
i
did
not
appear
kirsty
told
what
she
knew
they
searched
everywhere
but
could
not
find
me
and
great
as
my
misery
had
been
my
father
s
had
been
greater
than
mine
while
i
stood
forsaken
and
desolate
in
the
field
they
had
been
searching
along
the
banks
of
the
river
but
the
herd
had
had
an
idea
and
although
they
had
already
searched
the
barn
and
every
place
they
could
think
of
he
left
them
and
ran
back
for
a
further
search
about
the
farm
guided
by
the
scattered
straw
he
soon
came
upon
my
deserted
lair
and
sped
back
to
the
riverside
with
the
news
when
my
father
returned
and
after
failing
to
find
me
in
my
own
bed
to
his
infinite
relief
found
me
fast
asleep
on
his
so
fast
that
he
undressed
me
and
laid
me
in
the
bed
without
my
once
opening
my
eyes
the
more
strange
as
i
had
already
slept
so
long
but
sorrow
is
very
sleepy
having
thus
felt
the
awfulness
and
majesty
of
the
heavens
at
night
it
was
a
very
long
time
before
i
again
dreamed
my
childish
dream
chapter
vii
mitchell
is
defeated
after
this
talk
with
my
father
i
fell
into
a
sleep
of
perfect
contentment
and
never
thought
of
what
might
be
on
the
morrow
till
the
morrow
came
then
i
grew
aware
of
the
danger
i
was
in
of
being
carried
off
once
more
to
school
indeed
except
my
father
interfered
the
thing
was
almost
inevitable
i
thought
he
would
protect
me
but
i
had
no
assurance
he
was
gone
again
for
as
i
have
mentioned
already
he
was
given
to
going
out
early
in
the
mornings
it
was
not
early
now
however
i
had
slept
much
longer
than
usual
i
got
up
at
once
intending
to
find
him
but
to
my
horror
before
i
was
half
dressed
my
enemy
mitchell
came
into
the
room
looking
triumphant
and
revengeful
i
m
glad
to
see
you
re
getting
up
she
said
it
s
nearly
the
tone
and
the
emphasis
she
laid
on
the
word
would
have
sufficed
to
reveal
the
state
of
her
mind
even
if
her
eyes
had
not
been
fierce
with
suppressed
indignation
i
haven
t
had
my
porridge
i
said
your
porridge
is
waiting
you
as
cold
as
a
stone
she
answered
if
boys
will
lie
in
bed
so
late
what
can
they
expect
nothing
from
you
i
muttered
with
more
hardihood
than
i
had
yet
shown
her
what
s
that
you
re
saying
she
asked
angrily
i
was
silent
make
haste
she
went
on
and
don
t
keep
me
waiting
all
you
needn
t
wait
mitchell
i
am
dressing
as
fast
as
i
can
is
papa
in
his
study
yet
no
and
you
needn
t
think
to
see
him
he
s
angry
enough
with
you
i
ll
warrant
she
little
knew
what
had
passed
between
my
father
and
me
already
she
could
not
imagine
what
a
talk
we
had
had
you
needn
t
think
to
run
away
as
you
did
yesterday
i
know
all
about
it
shand
told
me
all
about
it
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
your
papa
s
gone
to
see
her
now
and
tell
her
how
sorry
he
is
you
were
so
i
m
not
going
to
we
ll
see
about
that
i
tell
you
i
won
t
and
i
tell
you
we
ll
see
about
it
i
won
t
go
till
i
ve
seen
papa
if
he
says
i
m
to
go
i
will
of
course
but
i
won
t
go
for
you
and
you
she
repeated
standing
staring
at
me
as
i
leisurely
but
with
hands
trembling
partly
with
fear
partly
with
rage
was
fastening
my
nether
garments
to
my
waistcoat
that
s
all
very
fine
but
i
know
something
a
good
deal
finer
now
wash
your
i
won
t
so
long
as
you
stand
there
i
said
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
she
advanced
towards
me
if
you
touch
me
i
ll
scream
i
cried
she
stopped
thought
for
a
moment
and
bounced
out
of
the
room
but
i
heard
her
turn
the
key
of
the
door
i
proceeded
with
my
dressing
as
fast
as
i
could
then
and
the
moment
i
was
ready
opened
the
window
which
was
only
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
scrambled
out
and
dropped
i
hurt
myself
a
little
but
not
much
and
fled
for
the
harbour
of
kirsty
s
arms
but
as
i
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
i
ran
right
into
mitchell
s
who
received
me
with
no
soft
embrace
in
fact
i
was
rather
severely
scratched
with
pin
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
there
that
serves
you
right
she
cried
that
s
a
judgment
on
you
for
trying
to
run
away
again
after
all
the
trouble
you
gave
us
yesterday
too
you
are
a
bad
why
am
i
a
bad
boy
i
retorted
it
s
bad
not
to
do
what
you
are
i
will
do
what
my
papa
tells
your
papa
there
are
more
people
than
your
papa
in
the
i
m
to
be
a
bad
boy
if
i
don
t
do
what
anybody
like
you
chooses
to
tell
me
am
i
none
of
your
impudence
this
was
accompanied
by
a
box
on
the
ear
she
was
now
dragging
me
into
the
kitchen
there
she
set
my
porridge
before
me
which
i
declined
to
eat
well
if
you
won
t
eat
good
food
you
shall
go
to
school
without
i
tell
you
i
won
t
go
to
she
caught
me
up
in
her
arms
she
was
very
strong
and
i
could
not
prevent
her
carrying
me
out
of
the
house
if
i
had
been
the
bad
boy
she
said
i
was
i
could
by
biting
and
scratching
have
soon
compelled
her
to
set
me
down
but
i
felt
that
i
must
not
do
that
for
then
i
should
be
ashamed
before
my
father
i
therefore
yielded
for
the
time
and
fell
to
planning
nor
was
i
long
in
coming
to
a
resolution
i
drew
the
pin
that
had
scratched
me
from
her
dress
i
believed
she
would
not
carry
me
very
far
but
if
she
did
not
set
me
down
soon
i
resolved
to
make
her
glad
to
do
so
further
i
resolved
that
when
we
came
to
the
which
had
but
one
rail
to
it
i
would
run
the
pin
into
her
and
make
her
let
me
go
when
i
would
instantly
throw
myself
into
the
river
for
i
would
run
the
risk
of
being
drowned
rather
than
go
to
that
school
were
all
my
griefs
of
yesterday
overcome
and
on
the
point
of
being
forgotten
to
be
frustrated
in
this
fashion
my
whole
blood
was
boiling
i
was
convinced
my
father
did
not
want
me
to
go
he
could
not
have
been
so
kind
to
me
during
the
night
and
then
send
me
to
such
a
place
in
the
morning
but
happily
for
the
general
peace
things
did
not
arrive
at
such
a
desperate
pass
before
we
were
out
of
the
gate
my
heart
leaped
with
joy
for
i
heard
my
father
calling
mrs
mitchell
mitchell
i
looked
round
and
seeing
him
coming
after
us
with
his
long
slow
strides
i
fell
to
struggling
so
violently
in
the
strength
of
hope
that
she
was
glad
to
set
me
down
i
broke
from
her
ran
to
my
father
and
burst
out
crying
papa
papa
i
sobbed
don
t
send
me
to
that
horrid
school
i
can
learn
to
read
without
that
old
woman
to
teach
really
mitchell
said
my
father
taking
me
by
the
hand
and
leading
me
towards
her
where
she
stood
visibly
flaming
with
rage
and
annoyance
really
mitchell
you
are
taking
too
much
upon
you
i
never
said
the
child
was
to
go
to
that
woman
s
school
in
fact
i
don
t
approve
of
what
i
hear
of
her
and
i
have
thought
of
consulting
some
of
my
brethren
in
the
presbytery
on
the
matter
before
taking
steps
myself
i
won
t
have
the
young
people
in
my
parish
oppressed
in
such
a
fashion
terrified
with
dogs
too
it
is
she
s
a
very
decent
woman
mistress
shand
said
the
housekeeper
illustration
i
don
t
dispute
her
decency
mitchell
but
i
doubt
very
much
whether
she
is
fit
to
have
the
charge
of
children
and
as
she
is
a
friend
of
yours
you
will
be
doing
her
a
kindness
to
give
her
a
hint
to
that
effect
it
save
the
necessity
for
my
taking
further
and
more
unpleasant
indeed
sir
by
your
leave
it
would
be
hard
lines
to
take
the
bread
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
lone
widow
woman
and
bring
her
upon
the
parish
with
a
bad
name
to
boot
she
s
supported
herself
for
years
with
her
school
and
been
a
trouble
to
except
the
lambs
of
the
flock
mrs
i
like
you
for
standing
up
for
your
friend
but
is
a
woman
because
she
is
lone
and
a
widow
to
make
a
moloch
of
herself
and
have
the
children
sacrificed
to
her
in
that
way
it
s
enough
to
make
idiots
of
some
of
them
she
had
better
see
to
it
you
tell
her
that
from
me
if
you
like
and
don
t
you
meddle
with
school
affairs
i
ll
take
my
young
men
he
added
with
a
smile
to
school
when
i
see
i
m
sure
sir
said
mitchell
putting
her
blue
striped
apron
to
her
eyes
i
asked
your
opinion
before
i
took
i
believe
i
did
say
something
about
its
being
time
he
were
able
to
read
but
i
recollect
nothing
you
must
have
misunderstood
me
he
added
willing
to
ease
her
descent
to
the
valley
of
her
humiliation
she
walked
away
without
another
word
sniffing
the
air
as
she
went
and
carrying
her
hands
folded
under
her
apron
from
that
hour
i
believe
she
hated
me
my
father
looked
after
her
with
a
smile
and
then
looked
down
on
me
saying
she
s
short
in
the
temper
poor
woman
and
we
mustn
t
provoke
i
was
too
well
satisfied
to
urge
my
victory
by
further
complaint
i
could
afford
to
let
well
alone
for
i
had
been
delivered
as
from
the
fiery
furnace
and
the
earth
and
the
sky
were
laughing
around
me
oh
what
a
sunshine
filled
the
world
how
glad
the
larks
which
are
the
praisers
amongst
the
birds
were
that
blessed
morning
the
demon
of
oppression
had
hidden
her
head
ashamed
and
fled
to
her
den
chapter
viii
a
new
schoolmistress
but
ranald
my
father
continued
what
are
we
to
do
about
the
reading
i
fear
i
have
let
you
go
too
long
i
didn
t
want
to
make
learning
a
burden
to
you
and
i
don
t
approve
of
children
learning
to
read
too
soon
but
really
at
your
age
you
know
it
is
time
you
were
beginning
i
have
time
to
teach
you
some
things
but
i
can
t
teach
you
everything
i
have
got
to
read
a
great
deal
and
think
a
great
deal
and
go
about
my
parish
a
good
deal
and
your
brother
tom
has
heavy
lessons
to
learn
at
school
and
i
have
to
help
him
so
what
s
to
be
done
ranald
my
boy
you
can
t
go
to
the
parish
school
before
you
ve
learned
your
there
s
kirsty
papa
i
suggested
yes
there
s
kirsty
he
returned
with
a
sly
smile
kirsty
can
do
everything
can
t
she
she
can
speak
gaelic
i
said
with
a
tone
of
triumph
bringing
her
rarest
accomplishment
to
the
forefront
i
wish
you
could
speak
gaelic
said
my
father
thinking
of
his
wife
i
believe
whose
mother
tongue
it
was
but
that
is
not
what
you
want
most
to
learn
do
you
think
kirsty
could
teach
you
to
read
english
yes
i
my
father
again
meditated
let
us
go
and
ask
her
he
said
at
length
taking
my
hand
i
capered
with
delight
nor
ceased
my
capering
till
we
stood
on
kirsty
s
earthen
floor
i
think
i
see
her
now
dusting
one
of
her
deal
chairs
as
white
as
soap
and
sand
could
make
it
for
the
minister
to
sit
on
she
never
called
him
but
always
she
was
a
great
favourite
with
my
father
and
he
always
behaved
as
a
visitor
in
her
house
well
kirsty
he
said
after
the
first
salutations
were
over
have
you
any
objection
to
turn
schoolmistress
i
should
make
a
poor
hand
at
that
she
answered
with
a
smile
to
me
which
showed
she
guessed
what
my
father
wanted
but
if
it
were
to
teach
master
ranald
there
i
should
like
dearly
to
try
what
i
could
she
never
omitted
the
to
our
names
mitchell
by
no
chance
prefixed
it
the
natural
manners
of
the
celt
and
saxon
are
almost
diametrically
opposed
in
scotland
and
had
kirsty
s
speech
been
in
the
coarse
dialect
of
mitchell
i
am
confident
my
father
would
not
have
allowed
her
to
teach
me
but
kirsty
did
not
speak
a
word
of
scotch
and
although
her
english
was
a
little
broken
and
odd
being
formed
somewhat
after
gaelic
idioms
her
tone
was
pure
and
her
phrases
were
refined
the
matter
was
very
speedily
settled
between
them
and
if
you
want
to
beat
him
kirsty
you
can
beat
him
in
gaelic
and
then
he
won
t
feel
it
said
my
father
trying
after
a
joke
which
was
no
common
occurrence
with
him
whereupon
kirsty
and
i
laughed
in
great
contentment
the
fact
was
kirsty
had
come
to
the
manse
with
my
mother
and
my
father
was
attached
to
her
for
the
sake
of
his
wife
as
well
as
for
her
own
and
kirsty
would
have
died
for
the
minister
or
any
one
of
his
boys
all
the
devotion
a
highland
woman
has
for
the
chief
of
her
clan
kirsty
had
for
my
father
not
to
mention
the
reverence
due
to
the
minister
after
a
little
chat
about
the
cows
and
the
calves
my
father
rose
saying
then
i
ll
just
make
him
over
to
you
kirsty
do
you
think
you
can
manage
without
letting
it
interfere
with
your
work
though
oh
yes
sir
well
that
i
shall
soon
have
him
reading
to
me
while
i
m
busy
about
if
he
doesn
t
know
the
word
he
can
spell
it
and
then
i
shall
know
it
at
least
if
it
s
not
longer
than
hawkie
s
hawkie
was
a
fine
milker
with
a
bad
temper
and
a
comically
short
tail
it
had
got
chopped
off
by
some
accident
when
she
was
a
calf
there
s
something
else
short
about
hawkie
isn
t
there
kirsty
said
my
father
and
mitchell
i
suggested
thinking
to
help
kirsty
to
my
father
s
meaning
come
come
young
gentleman
we
don
t
want
your
remarks
said
my
father
pleasantly
why
papa
you
told
me
so
yourself
just
before
we
came
yes
i
did
but
i
did
not
mean
you
to
repeat
it
what
if
kirsty
were
to
go
and
tell
mitchell
kirsty
made
no
attempt
at
protestation
she
knew
well
enough
that
my
father
knew
there
was
no
danger
she
only
laughed
and
i
seeing
kirsty
satisfied
was
satisfied
also
and
joined
in
the
laugh
the
result
was
that
before
many
weeks
were
over
allister
and
wee
davie
were
kirsty
s
pupils
also
allister
learning
to
read
and
wee
davie
to
sit
still
which
was
the
hardest
task
within
his
capacity
they
were
free
to
come
or
keep
away
but
not
to
go
if
they
did
come
kirsty
insisted
on
their
staying
out
the
lesson
it
soon
became
a
regular
thing
every
morning
in
summer
we
might
be
seen
perched
on
a
form
under
one
of
the
tiny
windows
in
that
delicious
brown
light
which
you
seldom
find
but
in
an
old
cottage
in
a
i
think
you
have
it
and
i
have
seen
it
in
an
old
castle
but
best
of
all
in
the
house
of
mourning
in
an
arab
cemetery
in
the
winter
we
seated
ourselves
round
the
fire
as
near
it
as
kirsty
s
cooking
operations
which
were
simple
enough
admitted
it
was
delightful
to
us
boys
and
would
have
been
amusing
to
anyone
to
see
how
kirsty
behaved
when
mitchell
found
occasion
to
pay
her
a
visit
during
lesson
hours
she
knew
her
step
and
darted
to
the
door
not
once
did
she
permit
her
to
enter
she
was
like
a
hen
with
her
chickens
no
you
ll
not
come
in
just
now
mitchell
she
would
say
as
the
housekeeper
attempted
to
pass
you
know
we
re
i
want
to
hear
how
they
re
getting
you
can
try
them
at
home
kirsty
would
answer
we
always
laughed
at
the
idea
of
our
reading
to
her
once
i
believe
she
heard
the
laugh
for
she
instantly
walked
away
and
i
do
not
remember
that
she
ever
came
again
chapter
ix
we
learn
other
things
we
were
more
than
ever
at
the
farm
now
during
the
summer
from
the
time
we
got
up
till
the
time
we
went
to
bed
we
seldom
approached
the
manse
i
have
heard
it
hinted
that
my
father
neglected
us
but
that
can
hardly
be
seeing
that
then
his
word
was
law
to
us
and
now
i
regard
his
memory
as
the
symbol
of
the
love
unspeakable
my
elder
brother
tom
always
had
his
meals
with
him
and
sat
at
his
lessons
in
the
study
but
my
father
did
not
mind
the
younger
ones
running
wild
so
long
as
there
was
a
kirsty
for
them
to
run
to
and
indeed
the
men
also
were
not
only
friendly
to
us
but
careful
over
us
no
doubt
we
were
rather
savage
very
different
in
our
appearance
from
children
who
are
washed
and
dressed
every
time
they
go
out
for
a
walk
that
we
should
have
considered
not
merely
a
hardship
but
an
indignity
to
be
free
was
all
our
notion
of
a
perfect
existence
but
my
father
s
rebuke
was
awful
indeed
if
he
found
even
the
youngest
guilty
of
untruth
or
cruelty
or
injustice
at
all
kinds
of
escapades
not
involving
disobedience
he
smiled
except
indeed
there
were
too
much
danger
when
he
would
warn
and
limit
a
town
boy
may
wonder
what
we
could
find
to
amuse
us
all
day
long
but
the
fact
is
almost
everything
was
an
amusement
seeing
that
when
we
could
not
take
a
natural
share
in
what
was
going
on
we
generally
managed
to
invent
some
collateral
employment
fictitiously
related
to
it
but
he
must
not
think
of
our
farm
as
at
all
like
some
great
farm
he
may
happen
to
know
in
england
for
there
was
nothing
done
by
machinery
on
the
place
there
may
be
great
pleasure
in
watching
but
surely
none
to
equal
the
pleasure
we
had
if
there
had
been
a
steam
engine
to
plough
my
father
s
fields
how
could
we
have
ridden
home
on
its
back
in
the
evening
to
ride
the
horses
home
from
the
plough
was
a
triumph
had
there
been
a
could
its
pleasures
have
been
comparable
to
that
of
lying
in
the
straw
and
watching
the
grain
dance
from
the
sheaves
under
the
skilful
flails
of
the
two
strong
men
who
belaboured
them
there
was
a
but
quite
a
tame
one
for
its
wheel
i
could
drive
myself
the
handle
now
high
as
my
head
now
low
as
my
knee
and
watch
at
the
same
time
the
storm
of
chaff
driven
like
drifting
snowflakes
from
its
wide
mouth
meantime
the
was
flowing
in
a
silent
slow
stream
from
the
shelving
hole
in
the
other
side
and
the
wind
rushing
through
the
opposite
doors
aided
the
winnower
by
catching
at
the
expelled
chaff
and
carrying
it
yet
farther
apart
i
think
i
see
old
eppie
now
filling
her
sack
with
what
the
wind
blew
her
not
with
the
grain
eppie
did
not
covet
that
she
only
wanted
her
bed
filled
with
fresh
springy
chaff
on
which
she
would
sleep
as
sound
as
her
rheumatism
would
let
her
and
as
warm
and
dry
and
comfortable
as
any
duchess
in
the
land
that
happened
to
have
the
rheumatism
too
for
comfort
is
inside
more
than
outside
and
eider
down
delicious
as
it
is
has
less
to
do
with
it
than
some
people
fancy
how
i
wish
all
the
poor
people
in
the
great
cities
could
have
good
chaff
beds
to
lie
upon
let
me
see
what
more
machines
are
there
now
more
than
i
can
tell
i
saw
one
going
in
the
fields
the
other
day
at
the
use
of
which
i
could
only
guess
strange
machines
as
the
scotch
would
call
them
are
growling
and
snapping
and
clinking
and
clattering
over
our
fields
so
that
it
seems
to
an
old
boy
as
if
all
the
sweet
poetic
twilight
of
things
were
vanishing
from
the
country
but
he
reminds
himself
that
god
is
not
going
to
sleep
for
as
one
of
the
greatest
poets
that
ever
lived
says
slumbereth
not
nor
and
the
children
of
the
earth
are
his
and
he
will
see
that
their
imaginations
and
feelings
have
food
enough
and
to
spare
it
is
his
business
this
not
ours
so
the
work
must
be
done
as
well
as
it
can
then
indeed
there
will
be
no
fear
of
the
poetry
i
have
just
alluded
to
the
pleasure
of
riding
the
horses
that
is
the
upon
them
allister
and
i
began
to
ride
as
far
as
i
can
remember
this
same
summer
not
from
the
plough
for
the
ploughing
was
in
the
end
of
the
year
and
the
spring
first
of
all
we
were
allowed
to
take
them
at
watched
by
one
of
the
men
from
the
stable
to
the
long
trough
that
stood
under
the
pump
there
going
hurriedly
and
stopping
suddenly
they
would
drop
head
and
neck
and
shoulders
like
a
certain
causing
the
young
riders
a
vague
fear
of
falling
over
the
height
no
longer
defended
by
the
uplifted
crest
and
then
drink
and
drink
till
the
riders
legs
felt
the
horses
bodies
swelling
under
them
then
up
and
away
with
quick
refreshed
stride
or
trot
towards
the
paradise
of
their
stalls
but
for
us
came
first
the
somewhat
fearful
pass
of
the
stable
door
for
they
never
stopped
like
better
educated
horses
to
let
their
riders
dismount
but
walked
right
in
and
there
was
just
room
by
stooping
low
to
clear
the
top
of
the
door
as
we
improved
in
equitation
we
would
go
afield
to
ride
them
home
from
the
pasture
where
they
were
fastened
by
chains
to
short
stakes
of
iron
driven
into
the
earth
there
was
more
of
adventure
here
for
not
only
was
the
ride
longer
but
the
horses
were
more
frisky
and
would
sometimes
set
off
at
the
gallop
then
the
chief
danger
was
again
the
door
lest
they
should
dash
in
and
knock
knees
against
posts
and
heads
against
lintels
for
we
had
only
halters
to
hold
them
with
but
after
i
had
once
been
thrown
from
back
to
neck
and
from
neck
to
ground
in
a
clumsy
but
wild
gallop
extemporized
by
dobbin
i
was
raised
to
the
dignity
of
a
bridle
which
i
always
carried
with
me
when
we
went
to
fetch
them
it
was
my
father
s
express
desire
that
until
we
could
sit
well
on
the
bare
back
we
should
not
be
allowed
a
saddle
it
was
a
whole
year
before
i
was
permitted
to
mount
his
little
black
riding
mare
called
missy
she
was
old
it
is
true
nobody
quite
knew
how
old
she
was
but
if
she
felt
a
light
weight
on
her
back
either
the
spirit
of
youth
was
contagious
or
she
fancied
herself
as
young
as
when
she
thought
nothing
of
twelve
stone
and
would
dart
off
like
the
wind
in
after
years
i
got
so
found
of
her
that
i
would
stand
by
her
side
flacking
the
flies
from
her
as
she
grazed
and
when
i
tired
of
that
would
clamber
upon
her
back
and
lie
there
reading
my
book
while
she
plucked
on
and
ground
and
mashed
away
at
the
grass
as
if
nobody
were
near
her
then
there
was
the
choice
if
nothing
else
were
found
more
attractive
of
going
to
the
field
where
the
cattle
were
grazing
oh
the
rich
hot
summer
afternoons
among
the
grass
and
the
clover
the
little
and
the
big
with
the
cattle
feeding
solemnly
but
one
and
another
straying
now
to
the
corn
now
to
the
turnips
and
recalled
by
stern
shouts
or
if
that
were
unavailing
by
vigorous
pursuit
and
even
blows
if
i
had
been
able
to
think
of
a
mother
at
home
i
should
have
been
perfectly
happy
not
that
i
missed
her
then
i
had
lost
her
too
young
for
that
i
mean
that
the
memory
of
the
time
wants
but
that
to
render
it
perfect
in
bliss
even
in
the
cold
days
of
spring
when
after
being
shut
up
all
the
winter
the
cattle
were
allowed
to
revel
again
in
the
springing
grass
and
the
venturesome
daisies
there
was
pleasure
enough
in
the
company
and
devices
of
the
cowherd
a
boy
of
ten
named
i
forget
his
real
name
we
always
called
him
turkey
because
his
nose
was
the
colour
of
a
turkey
s
egg
who
but
turkey
knew
mushrooms
from
toadstools
who
but
turkey
could
detect
and
that
with
the
certainty
of
a
dog
who
but
turkey
knew
the
note
and
the
form
and
the
nest
and
the
eggs
of
every
bird
in
the
country
who
but
turkey
with
his
little
whip
and
its
lash
of
brass
wire
would
encounter
the
angriest
bull
in
christendom
provided
he
carried
like
the
bulls
of
scotland
his
most
sensitive
part
the
nose
foremost
in
our
eyes
turkey
was
a
hero
who
but
turkey
could
discover
the
nests
of
hens
whose
maternal
anxiety
had
eluded
the
of
kirsty
and
who
so
well
as
he
could
roast
the
egg
with
which
she
always
rewarded
such
a
discovery
words
are
feeble
before
the
delight
we
experienced
on
such
an
occasion
when
turkey
proceeding
to
light
a
fire
against
one
of
the
earthen
walls
which
divided
the
fields
would
send
us
abroad
to
gather
sticks
and
straws
and
whatever
outcast
combustibles
we
could
find
of
which
there
was
a
great
scarcity
there
being
no
woods
or
hedges
within
reach
who
like
turkey
could
rob
a
wild
bee
s
nest
and
who
could
be
more
just
than
he
in
distributing
the
luscious
prize
in
fine
his
accomplishments
were
innumerable
short
of
flying
we
believed
him
capable
of
everything
imaginable
what
rendered
him
yet
dearer
to
us
was
that
there
was
enmity
between
him
and
mitchell
it
came
about
in
this
way
although
a
good
milker
and
therefore
of
necessity
a
good
feeder
hawkie
was
yet
upon
temptation
subject
to
the
inroads
of
an
unnatural
appetite
when
she
found
a
piece
of
an
old
shoe
in
the
field
she
would
if
not
compelled
to
drop
the
delicious
mouthful
go
on
the
whole
morning
or
afternoon
in
the
impossibility
of
a
final
deglutition
chewing
and
chewing
at
the
savoury
morsel
should
this
have
happened
it
was
in
vain
for
turkey
to
hope
escape
from
the
discovery
of
his
inattention
for
the
would
that
same
evening
or
next
morning
reveal
the
fact
to
kirsty
s
watchful
eyes
but
fortunately
for
us
in
so
far
as
it
was
well
to
have
an
ally
against
our
only
enemy
hawkie
s
morbid
craving
was
not
confined
to
old
shoes
one
day
when
the
cattle
were
feeding
close
by
the
manse
she
found
on
the
which
surrounded
it
mitchell
s
best
cap
laid
out
to
bleach
in
the
sun
it
was
a
tempting
morsel
more
susceptible
of
mastication
than
mitchell
who
had
gone
for
another
freight
of
the
linen
with
which
she
was
sprinkling
the
hedge
arrived
only
in
time
to
see
the
end
of
one
of
its
long
strings
gradually
disappearing
into
hawkie
s
mouth
on
its
way
after
the
rest
of
the
cap
which
had
gone
the
length
of
the
string
farther
with
a
wild
cry
of
despair
she
flew
at
hawkie
so
intent
on
the
stolen
delicacy
as
to
be
more
open
to
a
surprise
than
usual
and
laying
hold
of
the
string
drew
from
her
throat
the
deplorable
mass
of
pulp
to
which
she
had
reduced
the
valued
gaud
the
same
moment
turkey
who
had
come
running
at
her
cry
received
full
in
his
face
the
slimy
and
sloppy
extract
nor
was
this
all
for
mitchell
flew
at
him
in
her
fury
and
with
an
outburst
of
abuse
boxed
his
ears
soundly
before
he
could
recover
his
senses
sufficiently
to
run
for
it
the
degradation
of
this
treatment
had
converted
turkey
into
an
enemy
before
ever
he
knew
that
we
also
had
good
grounds
for
disliking
her
his
opinion
concerning
her
was
freely
expressed
to
us
if
to
no
one
else
generally
in
the
same
terms
he
said
she
was
as
bad
as
she
was
ugly
and
always
spoke
of
her
as
old
but
what
brought
turkey
and
us
together
more
than
anything
else
was
that
he
was
as
fond
of
kirsty
s
stories
as
we
were
and
in
the
winter
especially
we
would
sit
together
in
the
evening
as
i
have
already
said
round
her
fire
and
the
great
pot
upon
it
full
of
the
most
delicious
potatoes
while
kirsty
knitted
away
vigorously
at
her
blue
stockings
and
kept
a
sort
of
time
to
her
story
with
the
sound
of
her
needles
when
the
story
flagged
the
needles
went
slower
in
the
more
animated
passages
they
would
become
invisible
for
swiftness
save
for
a
certain
shimmering
flash
that
hovered
about
her
fingers
like
a
dim
electric
play
but
as
the
story
approached
some
crisis
their
motion
would
at
one
time
become
perfectly
frantic
at
another
cease
altogether
as
finding
the
subject
beyond
their
power
of
accompanying
expression
when
they
ceased
we
knew
that
something
awful
indeed
was
at
hand
illustration
in
my
next
chapter
i
will
give
a
specimen
of
her
stories
choosing
one
which
bears
a
little
upon
an
after
adventure
chapter
x
sir
worm
wymble
it
was
a
snowy
evening
in
the
depth
of
winter
kirsty
had
promised
to
tell
us
the
tale
of
the
armed
knight
who
lay
in
stone
upon
the
tomb
in
the
church
but
the
snow
was
so
deep
that
mitchell
always
glad
when
nature
put
it
in
her
power
to
exercise
her
authority
in
a
way
disagreeable
to
us
had
refused
to
let
the
little
ones
go
out
all
day
therefore
turkey
and
i
when
the
darkness
began
to
grow
thick
enough
went
prowling
and
watching
about
the
manse
until
we
found
an
opportunity
when
she
was
out
of
the
way
the
moment
this
occurred
we
darted
into
the
nursery
which
was
on
the
ground
floor
and
catching
up
my
two
brothers
i
wee
davie
he
allister
we
hoisted
them
on
our
backs
and
rushed
from
the
house
it
was
snowing
it
came
down
in
huge
flakes
but
although
it
was
only
four
o
clock
they
did
not
show
any
whiteness
for
there
was
no
light
to
shine
upon
them
you
might
have
thought
there
had
been
mud
in
the
cloud
they
came
from
which
had
turned
them
all
a
dark
grey
how
the
little
ones
did
enjoy
it
spurring
their
horses
with
suppressed
laughter
and
urging
us
on
lest
the
old
witch
should
hear
and
overtake
us
but
it
was
hard
work
for
one
of
the
horses
and
that
was
myself
turkey
scudded
away
with
his
load
and
made
nothing
of
it
but
wee
davie
pulled
so
hard
with
his
little
arms
round
my
neck
especially
when
he
was
bobbing
up
and
down
to
urge
me
on
half
in
delight
half
in
terror
that
he
nearly
choked
me
while
if
i
went
one
foot
off
the
scarcely
beaten
path
i
sunk
deep
in
the
fresh
snow
doe
on
doe
on
yanal
cried
davie
and
yanal
did
his
very
best
but
was
only
halfway
to
the
farm
when
turkey
came
bounding
back
to
take
davie
from
him
in
a
few
moments
we
had
shaken
the
snow
off
our
shoes
and
off
davie
s
back
and
stood
around
kirsty
s
booful
baze
as
davie
called
the
fire
kirsty
seated
herself
on
one
side
with
davie
on
her
lap
and
we
three
got
our
chairs
as
near
her
as
we
could
with
turkey
as
the
valiant
man
of
the
party
farthest
from
the
centre
of
safety
namely
kirsty
who
was
at
the
same
time
to
be
the
source
of
all
the
delightful
horror
i
may
as
well
say
that
i
do
not
believe
kirsty
s
tale
had
the
remotest
historical
connection
with
sir
worm
wymble
if
that
was
anything
like
the
name
of
the
dead
knight
it
was
an
old
highland
legend
which
she
adorned
with
the
flowers
of
her
own
celtic
fancy
and
swathed
around
the
form
so
familiar
to
us
all
there
is
a
pot
in
the
highlands
began
kirsty
not
far
from
our
house
at
the
bottom
of
a
little
glen
it
is
not
very
big
but
fearfully
deep
so
deep
that
they
do
say
there
is
no
bottom
to
an
iron
pot
kirsty
asked
allister
no
goosey
answered
kirsty
a
pot
means
a
great
hole
full
of
water
black
black
and
deep
oh
remarked
allister
and
was
silent
well
in
this
pot
there
lived
a
what
s
a
kelpie
kirsty
again
interposed
allister
who
in
general
asked
all
the
necessary
questions
and
at
least
as
many
unnecessary
a
kelpie
is
an
awful
creature
that
eats
but
what
is
it
like
kirsty
it
s
something
like
a
horse
with
a
head
like
a
how
big
is
it
as
big
as
hawkie
bigger
than
hawkie
bigger
than
the
biggest
ox
you
ever
has
it
a
great
mouth
yes
a
terrible
with
teeth
not
many
but
dreadfully
big
oh
well
there
was
a
shepherd
many
years
ago
who
lived
not
far
from
the
pot
he
was
a
knowing
man
and
understood
all
about
kelpies
and
brownies
and
fairies
and
he
put
a
branch
of
the
with
the
red
berries
in
it
over
the
door
of
his
cottage
so
that
the
kelpie
could
never
come
in
now
the
shepherd
had
a
very
beautiful
daughter
so
beautiful
that
the
kelpie
wanted
very
much
to
eat
her
i
suppose
he
had
lifted
up
his
head
out
of
the
pot
some
day
and
seen
her
go
past
but
he
could
not
come
out
of
the
pot
except
after
the
sun
was
why
asked
allister
i
don
t
know
it
was
the
nature
of
the
beast
his
eyes
couldn
t
bear
the
light
i
suppose
but
he
could
see
in
the
dark
quite
one
night
the
girl
woke
suddenly
and
saw
his
great
head
looking
in
at
her
but
how
could
she
see
him
when
it
was
dark
said
allister
his
eyes
were
flashing
so
that
they
lighted
up
all
his
head
answered
kirsty
but
he
couldn
t
get
in
no
he
couldn
t
get
in
he
was
only
looking
in
and
thinking
how
he
like
to
eat
her
so
in
the
morning
she
told
her
father
and
her
father
was
very
frightened
and
told
her
she
must
never
be
out
one
moment
after
the
sun
was
down
and
for
a
long
time
the
girl
was
very
careful
and
she
had
need
to
be
for
the
creature
never
made
any
noise
but
came
up
as
quiet
as
a
shadow
one
afternoon
however
she
had
gone
to
meet
her
lover
a
little
way
down
the
glen
and
they
stopped
talking
so
long
about
one
thing
and
another
that
the
sun
was
almost
set
before
she
bethought
herself
she
said
at
once
and
ran
for
home
now
she
could
not
reach
home
without
passing
the
pot
and
just
as
she
passed
the
pot
she
saw
the
last
sparkle
of
the
sun
as
he
went
i
should
think
she
ran
remarked
our
mouthpiece
allister
she
did
run
said
kirsty
and
had
just
got
past
the
awful
black
pot
which
was
terrible
enough
day
or
night
without
such
a
beast
in
it
when
but
there
the
beast
in
it
said
allister
when
kirsty
went
on
without
heeding
him
she
heard
a
great
of
water
behind
her
that
was
the
water
tumbling
off
the
beast
s
back
as
he
came
up
from
the
bottom
if
she
ran
before
she
flew
now
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
she
couldn
t
hear
him
behind
her
so
as
to
tell
whereabouts
he
was
he
might
be
just
opening
his
mouth
to
take
her
every
moment
at
last
she
reached
the
door
which
her
father
who
had
gone
out
to
look
for
her
had
set
wide
open
that
she
might
run
in
at
once
but
all
the
breath
was
out
of
her
body
and
she
fell
down
flat
just
as
she
got
illustration
here
allister
jumped
from
his
seat
clapping
his
hands
and
crying
then
the
kelpie
didn
t
eat
her
kirsty
kirsty
no
but
as
she
fell
one
foot
was
left
outside
the
threshold
so
that
the
rowan
branch
could
not
take
care
of
it
and
the
beast
laid
hold
of
the
foot
with
his
great
mouth
to
drag
her
out
of
the
cottage
and
eat
her
at
his
here
allister
s
face
was
a
picture
to
behold
his
hair
was
almost
standing
on
end
his
mouth
was
open
and
his
face
as
white
as
my
paper
make
haste
kirsty
said
turkey
or
allister
will
go
in
a
but
her
shoe
came
off
in
his
mouth
and
she
drew
in
her
foot
and
was
allister
s
hair
subsided
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
sat
down
again
but
turkey
must
have
been
a
very
wise
or
a
very
unimaginative
turkey
for
here
he
broke
in
with
i
don
t
believe
a
word
of
it
what
said
kirsty
don
t
believe
it
no
she
lost
her
shoe
in
the
mud
it
was
some
wild
duck
she
heard
in
the
pot
and
there
was
no
beast
after
her
she
never
saw
it
you
she
saw
it
look
in
at
her
yes
yes
that
was
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
ve
seen
as
much
myself
when
i
waked
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
took
a
rat
for
a
tiger
kirsty
was
looking
angry
and
her
needles
were
going
even
faster
than
when
she
approached
the
climax
of
the
shoe
hold
your
tongue
turkey
i
said
and
let
us
hear
the
rest
of
the
but
kirsty
kept
her
eyes
on
her
knitting
and
did
not
resume
is
that
all
kirsty
said
allister
still
kirsty
returned
no
answer
she
needed
all
her
force
to
overcome
the
anger
she
was
busy
stifling
for
it
would
never
do
for
one
in
her
position
to
lose
her
temper
because
of
the
unbelieving
criticism
of
a
it
was
a
curious
instance
of
the
electricity
flashed
out
in
the
confluence
of
unlike
things
the
celtic
faith
and
the
saxon
works
for
anger
is
just
the
electric
flash
of
the
mind
and
requires
to
have
its
conductor
of
common
sense
ready
at
hand
after
a
few
moments
she
began
again
as
if
she
had
never
stopped
and
no
remarks
had
been
made
only
her
voice
trembled
a
little
at
first
her
father
came
home
soon
after
in
great
distress
and
there
he
found
her
lying
just
within
the
door
he
saw
at
once
how
it
was
and
his
anger
was
kindled
against
her
lover
more
than
the
beast
not
that
he
had
any
objection
to
her
going
to
meet
him
for
although
he
was
a
gentleman
and
his
daughter
only
a
shepherd
s
daughter
they
were
both
of
the
blood
of
the
this
was
kirsty
s
own
clan
and
indeed
i
have
since
discovered
that
the
original
legend
on
which
her
story
was
founded
belongs
to
the
island
of
rasay
from
which
she
came
but
why
was
he
angry
with
the
gentleman
asked
allister
because
he
liked
her
company
better
than
he
loved
herself
said
kirsty
at
least
that
was
what
the
shepherd
said
and
that
he
ought
to
have
seen
her
safe
home
but
he
didn
t
know
that
macleod
s
father
had
threatened
to
kill
him
if
ever
he
spoke
to
the
girl
but
said
allister
i
thought
it
was
about
sir
worm
wymble
not
sure
boy
and
am
i
not
going
to
tell
you
how
he
got
the
new
name
of
him
returned
kirsty
with
an
eagerness
that
showed
her
fear
lest
the
spirit
of
inquiry
should
spread
he
wasn
t
sir
worm
wymble
then
his
name
was
here
she
paused
a
moment
and
looked
full
at
allister
his
name
was
allister
allister
allister
exclaimed
my
brother
repeating
the
name
as
an
incredible
coincidence
yes
allister
said
kirsty
there
s
been
many
an
allister
and
not
all
of
them
macleods
that
did
what
they
ought
to
do
and
didn
t
know
what
fear
was
and
you
ll
be
another
my
bonnie
allister
i
hope
she
added
stroking
the
boy
s
hair
allister
s
face
flushed
with
pleasure
it
was
long
before
he
asked
another
question
well
as
i
say
resumed
kirsty
the
father
of
her
was
very
angry
and
said
she
should
never
go
and
meet
allister
again
but
the
girl
said
she
ought
to
go
once
and
let
him
know
why
she
could
not
come
any
more
for
she
had
no
complaint
to
make
of
allister
and
she
had
agreed
to
meet
him
on
a
certain
day
the
week
after
and
there
was
no
in
those
parts
and
so
she
did
meet
him
and
told
him
all
about
it
and
allister
said
nothing
much
then
but
next
day
he
came
striding
up
to
the
cottage
at
with
his
claymore
at
one
side
his
dirk
at
the
other
and
his
little
skene
dubh
in
his
stocking
and
he
was
grand
to
see
such
a
big
strong
gentleman
i
and
he
came
striding
up
to
the
cottage
where
the
shepherd
was
sitting
at
his
dinner
angus
macqueen
says
he
i
understand
the
kelpie
in
the
pot
has
been
rude
to
your
nellie
i
am
going
to
kill
how
will
you
do
that
sir
said
angus
quite
short
for
he
was
the
girl
s
father
here
s
a
claymore
i
could
put
in
a
peck
said
allister
meaning
it
was
such
good
steel
that
he
could
bend
it
round
till
the
hilt
met
the
point
without
breaking
and
here
s
a
shield
made
out
of
the
hide
of
old
rasay
s
black
bull
and
here
s
a
dirk
made
of
a
foot
and
a
half
of
an
old
andrew
ferrara
and
here
s
a
skene
dubh
that
i
ll
drive
through
your
door
angus
and
so
we
re
fitted
i
not
at
all
said
angus
who
as
i
told
you
was
a
wise
man
and
a
knowing
not
one
bit
said
angus
the
kelpie
s
hide
is
thicker
than
three
and
none
of
your
weapons
would
do
more
than
mark
what
am
i
to
do
then
angus
for
kill
him
i
will
somehow
i
ll
tell
you
what
to
do
but
it
needs
a
brave
man
to
do
and
do
you
think
i
m
not
brave
enough
for
that
angus
i
know
one
thing
you
are
not
brave
enough
and
what
s
that
said
allister
and
his
face
grew
red
only
he
did
not
want
to
anger
nelly
s
father
you
re
not
brave
enough
to
marry
my
girl
in
the
face
of
the
clan
said
angus
but
you
shan
t
go
on
this
way
if
my
nelly
s
good
enough
to
talk
to
in
the
glen
she
s
good
enough
to
lead
into
the
hall
before
the
ladies
and
then
allister
s
face
grew
redder
still
but
not
with
anger
and
he
held
down
his
head
before
the
old
man
but
only
for
a
few
moments
when
he
lifted
it
again
it
was
pale
not
with
fear
but
with
resolution
for
he
had
made
up
his
mind
like
a
gentleman
mr
angus
macqueen
he
said
will
you
give
me
your
daughter
to
be
my
wife
if
you
kill
the
kelpie
i
will
answered
angus
for
he
knew
that
the
man
who
could
do
that
would
be
worthy
of
his
but
what
if
the
kelpie
ate
him
suggested
allister
then
he
d
have
to
go
without
the
girl
said
kirsty
coolly
but
she
resumed
there
s
always
some
way
of
doing
a
difficult
thing
and
allister
the
gentleman
had
angus
the
shepherd
to
teach
him
so
angus
took
allister
down
to
the
pot
and
there
they
began
they
tumbled
great
stones
together
and
set
them
up
in
two
rows
at
a
little
distance
from
each
other
making
a
lane
between
the
rows
big
enough
for
the
kelpie
to
walk
in
if
the
kelpie
heard
them
he
could
not
see
them
and
they
took
care
to
get
into
the
cottage
before
it
was
dark
for
they
could
not
finish
their
preparations
in
one
day
and
they
sat
up
all
night
and
saw
the
huge
head
of
the
beast
looking
in
now
at
one
window
now
at
another
all
night
long
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
up
they
set
to
work
again
and
finished
the
two
rows
of
stones
all
the
way
from
the
pot
to
the
top
of
the
little
hill
on
which
the
cottage
stood
then
they
tied
a
cross
of
twigs
on
every
stone
so
that
once
the
beast
was
in
the
avenue
of
stones
he
could
only
get
out
at
the
end
and
this
was
nelly
s
part
of
the
job
next
they
gathered
a
quantity
of
furze
and
brushwood
and
peat
and
piled
it
in
the
end
of
the
avenue
next
the
cottage
then
angus
went
and
killed
a
little
pig
and
dressed
it
ready
for
cooking
now
you
go
down
to
my
brother
hamish
he
said
to
macleod
he
s
a
carpenter
you
know
and
ask
him
to
lend
you
his
longest
what
s
a
wimble
asked
little
allister
illustration
a
wimble
is
a
long
tool
like
a
great
gimlet
with
a
cross
handle
with
which
you
turn
it
like
a
screw
and
allister
ran
and
fetched
it
and
got
back
only
half
an
hour
before
the
sun
went
down
then
they
put
nelly
into
the
cottage
and
shut
the
door
but
i
ought
to
have
told
you
that
they
had
built
up
a
great
heap
of
stones
behind
the
brushwood
and
now
they
lighted
the
brushwood
and
put
down
the
pig
to
roast
by
the
fire
and
laid
the
wimble
in
the
fire
halfway
up
to
the
handle
then
they
laid
themselves
down
behind
the
heap
of
stones
and
waited
by
the
time
the
sun
was
out
of
sight
the
smell
of
the
roasting
pig
had
got
down
the
avenue
to
the
side
of
the
pot
just
where
the
kelpie
always
got
out
he
smelt
it
the
moment
he
put
up
his
head
and
he
thought
it
smelt
so
nice
that
he
would
go
and
see
where
it
was
the
moment
he
got
out
he
was
between
the
stones
but
he
never
thought
of
that
for
it
was
the
straight
way
to
the
pig
so
up
the
avenue
he
came
and
as
it
was
dark
and
his
big
soft
web
feet
made
no
noise
the
men
could
not
see
him
until
he
came
into
the
light
of
the
fire
there
he
is
said
allister
hush
said
angus
he
can
hear
well
so
the
beast
came
on
now
angus
had
meant
that
he
should
be
busy
with
the
pig
before
allister
should
attack
him
but
allister
thought
it
was
a
pity
he
should
have
the
pig
and
he
put
out
his
hand
and
got
hold
of
the
wimble
and
drew
it
gently
out
of
the
fire
and
the
wimble
was
so
hot
that
it
was
as
white
as
the
whitest
moon
you
ever
saw
the
pig
was
so
hot
also
that
the
brute
was
afraid
to
touch
it
and
before
ever
he
put
his
nose
to
it
allister
had
thrust
the
wimble
into
his
hide
behind
the
left
shoulder
and
was
boring
away
with
all
his
might
the
kelpie
gave
a
hideous
roar
and
turned
away
to
run
from
the
wimble
but
he
could
not
get
over
the
row
of
crossed
stones
and
he
had
to
turn
right
round
in
the
narrow
space
before
he
could
run
allister
however
could
run
as
well
as
the
kelpie
and
he
hung
on
to
the
handle
of
the
wimble
giving
it
another
turn
at
every
chance
as
the
beast
went
floundering
on
so
that
before
he
reached
his
pot
the
wimble
had
reached
his
heart
and
the
kelpie
fell
dead
on
the
edge
of
the
pot
then
they
went
home
and
when
the
pig
was
properly
done
they
had
it
for
supper
and
angus
gave
nelly
to
allister
and
they
were
married
and
lived
happily
ever
but
didn
t
allister
s
father
kill
him
no
he
thought
better
of
it
and
didn
t
he
was
very
angry
for
a
while
but
he
got
over
it
in
time
and
allister
became
a
great
man
and
because
of
what
he
had
done
he
was
called
allister
macleod
no
more
but
sir
worm
wymble
and
when
he
died
concluded
kirsty
he
was
buried
under
the
tomb
in
your
father
s
church
and
if
you
look
close
enough
you
ll
find
a
wimble
carved
on
the
stone
but
i
m
afraid
it
s
worn
out
by
this
chapter
xi
the
kelpie
silence
followed
the
close
of
kirsty
s
tale
wee
davie
had
taken
no
harm
for
he
was
fast
asleep
with
his
head
on
her
bosom
allister
was
staring
into
the
fire
fancying
he
saw
the
whorls
of
the
wimble
heating
in
it
turkey
was
cutting
at
his
stick
with
a
blunt
and
a
silent
whistle
on
his
puckered
lips
i
was
sorry
the
story
was
over
and
was
growing
stupid
under
the
reaction
from
its
excitement
i
was
however
meditating
a
strict
search
for
the
wimble
carved
on
the
knight
s
tomb
all
at
once
came
the
sound
of
a
latch
lifted
in
vain
followed
by
a
thundering
at
the
outer
door
which
kirsty
had
prudently
locked
allister
turkey
and
i
started
to
our
feet
allister
with
a
cry
of
dismay
turkey
grasping
his
stick
it
s
the
kelpie
cried
allister
but
the
harsh
voice
of
the
old
witch
followed
something
deadened
by
the
intervening
door
kirsty
kirsty
it
cried
open
the
door
no
no
kirsty
i
objected
she
ll
shake
wee
davie
to
bits
and
haul
allister
through
the
snow
she
s
afraid
to
touch
turkey
thrust
the
poker
in
the
fire
but
kirsty
snatched
it
out
threw
it
down
and
boxed
his
ears
which
rough
proceeding
he
took
with
the
pleasantest
laugh
in
the
world
kirsty
could
do
what
she
pleased
for
she
was
no
tyrant
she
turned
to
us
hush
she
said
hurriedly
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eyes
that
showed
the
spirit
of
fun
was
predominant
hush
don
t
speak
wee
davie
she
continued
as
she
rose
and
carried
him
from
the
kitchen
into
the
passage
between
it
and
the
outer
door
he
was
scarcely
awake
now
in
that
passage
which
was
wide
and
indeed
more
like
a
hall
in
proportion
to
the
cottage
had
stood
on
its
end
from
time
immemorial
a
huge
barrel
which
kirsty
with
some
housewifely
intent
or
other
had
lately
cleaned
out
setting
davie
down
she
and
turkey
lifted
first
me
and
popped
me
into
it
and
then
allister
for
we
caught
the
design
at
once
finally
she
took
up
wee
davie
and
telling
him
to
lie
as
still
as
a
mouse
dropped
him
into
our
arms
i
happened
to
find
the
open
near
my
eye
and
peeped
out
the
knocking
continued
wait
a
bit
mitchell
screamed
kirsty
wait
till
i
get
my
potatoes
off
the
as
she
spoke
she
took
the
great
in
one
hand
and
carried
it
to
the
door
to
pour
away
the
water
when
she
unlocked
and
opened
the
door
i
saw
through
the
a
lovely
sight
for
the
moon
was
shining
and
the
snow
was
falling
thick
in
the
midst
of
it
stood
mitchell
one
mass
of
whiteness
she
would
have
rushed
in
but
kirsty
s
advance
with
the
pot
made
her
give
way
and
from
behind
kirsty
turkey
slipped
out
and
round
the
corner
without
being
seen
there
he
stood
watching
but
busy
at
the
same
time
kneading
snowballs
and
what
may
you
please
to
want
mitchell
said
kirsty
with
great
civility
what
should
i
want
but
my
poor
children
they
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
an
hour
ago
really
kirsty
you
ought
to
have
more
sense
at
your
years
than
to
encourage
any
such
goings
at
my
years
returned
kirsty
and
was
about
to
give
a
sharp
retort
but
checked
herself
saying
aren
t
they
in
bed
then
mitchell
you
know
well
enough
they
are
poor
things
i
would
recommend
you
to
put
them
to
bed
at
so
i
will
where
are
they
find
them
yourself
mitchell
you
had
better
ask
a
civil
tongue
to
help
you
i
m
not
going
to
do
they
were
standing
just
inside
the
door
mitchell
advanced
i
trembled
it
seemed
impossible
she
should
not
see
me
as
well
as
i
saw
her
i
had
a
vague
impression
that
by
looking
at
her
i
should
draw
her
eyes
upon
me
but
i
could
not
withdraw
mine
from
the
i
was
fascinated
and
the
nearer
she
came
the
less
could
i
keep
from
watching
her
when
she
turned
into
the
kitchen
it
was
a
great
relief
but
it
did
not
last
long
for
she
came
out
again
in
a
moment
searching
like
a
hound
she
was
taller
than
kirsty
and
by
standing
on
her
tiptoes
could
have
looked
right
down
into
the
barrel
she
was
approaching
it
with
that
intent
those
eyes
were
about
to
overshadow
us
with
their
baleful
light
already
her
apron
hid
all
other
vision
from
my
one
eye
when
a
whizz
a
dull
blow
and
a
shriek
from
mitchell
came
to
my
ears
together
the
next
moment
the
field
of
my
vision
was
open
and
i
saw
mitchell
holding
her
head
with
both
hands
and
the
face
of
turkey
grinning
round
the
corner
of
the
open
door
evidently
he
wanted
to
entice
her
to
follow
him
but
she
had
been
too
much
astonished
by
the
snowball
in
the
back
of
her
neck
even
to
look
in
the
direction
whence
the
blow
had
come
so
turkey
stepped
out
and
was
just
poising
himself
in
the
delivery
of
a
second
missile
when
she
turned
sharp
round
the
snowball
missed
her
and
came
with
a
great
bang
against
the
barrel
wee
davie
gave
a
cry
of
alarm
but
there
was
no
danger
now
for
mitchell
was
off
after
turkey
in
a
moment
kirsty
lowered
the
barrel
on
its
side
and
we
all
crept
out
i
had
wee
davie
on
my
back
instantly
while
kirsty
caught
up
allister
and
we
were
off
for
the
manse
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
the
yard
however
we
met
turkey
breathless
he
had
given
mitchell
the
slip
and
left
her
searching
the
barn
for
him
he
took
allister
from
kirsty
and
we
sped
away
for
it
was
all
downhill
now
when
mitchell
got
back
to
the
farmhouse
kirsty
was
busy
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
when
after
a
fruitless
search
she
returned
to
the
manse
we
were
all
snug
in
bed
with
the
door
locked
after
what
had
passed
about
the
school
mitchell
did
not
dare
make
any
disturbance
from
that
night
she
always
went
by
the
name
of
chapter
xii
another
kelpie
in
the
summer
we
all
slept
in
a
large
room
in
the
wide
sloping
roof
it
had
a
dormer
window
at
no
great
distance
above
the
eaves
one
day
there
was
something
doing
about
the
ivy
which
covered
all
the
gable
and
half
the
front
of
the
house
and
the
ladder
they
had
been
using
was
left
leaning
against
the
back
it
reached
a
little
above
the
eaves
right
under
the
dormer
window
that
night
i
could
not
sleep
as
was
not
unfrequently
the
case
with
me
on
such
occasions
i
used
to
go
wandering
about
the
upper
part
of
the
house
i
believe
the
servants
thought
i
walked
in
my
sleep
but
it
was
not
so
for
i
always
knew
what
i
was
about
well
enough
i
do
not
remember
whether
this
began
after
that
dreadful
night
when
i
woke
in
the
barn
but
i
do
think
the
enjoyment
it
gave
me
was
rooted
in
the
starry
loneliness
in
which
i
had
then
found
myself
i
wonder
if
i
can
explain
my
feelings
the
pleasure
arose
from
a
sort
of
sense
of
protected
danger
on
that
memorable
night
i
had
been
as
it
were
naked
to
all
the
silence
alone
in
the
vast
universe
which
kept
looking
at
me
full
of
something
it
knew
but
would
not
speak
now
when
wandering
about
sleepless
i
could
gaze
as
from
a
nest
of
safety
out
upon
the
beautiful
fear
from
window
to
window
i
would
go
in
the
middle
of
the
night
now
staring
into
a
blank
darkness
out
of
which
came
the
only
signs
of
its
being
the
raindrops
that
bespattered
or
the
hailstones
that
berattled
the
panes
now
gazing
into
the
deeps
of
the
blue
vault
with
its
worlds
or
again
into
the
mysteries
of
soft
clouds
all
gathered
into
an
opal
tent
by
the
of
the
moon
thinking
out
her
light
over
its
shining
and
shadowy
folds
this
i
have
said
was
one
of
those
nights
on
which
i
could
not
sleep
it
was
the
summer
after
the
of
the
kelpie
i
believe
but
the
past
is
confused
and
its
chronology
worthless
to
the
continuous
of
childhood
the
night
was
hot
my
little
brothers
were
sleeping
loud
as
wee
davie
called
and
a
great
moth
had
got
within
my
curtains
somewhere
and
kept
on
fluttering
and
whirring
i
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
it
was
such
a
night
the
moon
was
full
but
rather
low
and
looked
just
as
if
she
were
thinking
nobody
is
heeding
me
i
may
as
well
go
to
all
the
top
of
the
sky
was
covered
with
clouds
lying
like
milky
ripples
on
a
blue
sea
and
through
them
the
stars
shot
here
and
there
sharp
little
rays
like
sparkling
diamonds
there
was
no
awfulness
about
it
as
on
the
night
when
the
gulfy
sky
stood
over
me
flashing
with
the
heavenly
host
and
nothing
was
between
me
and
the
farthest
world
the
clouds
were
like
the
veil
that
hid
the
terrible
light
in
the
holy
of
holies
a
curtain
of
god
s
love
to
dim
with
loveliness
the
grandeur
of
their
own
being
and
make
his
children
able
to
bear
it
my
eye
fell
upon
the
top
rounds
of
the
ladder
which
rose
above
the
edge
of
the
roof
like
an
invitation
i
opened
the
window
crept
through
and
holding
on
by
the
ledge
let
myself
down
over
the
slates
feeling
with
my
feet
for
the
top
of
the
ladder
in
a
moment
i
was
upon
it
down
i
went
and
oh
how
tender
to
my
bare
feet
was
the
cool
grass
on
which
i
alighted
i
looked
up
the
dark
housewall
rose
above
me
i
could
ascend
again
when
i
pleased
there
was
no
hurry
i
would
walk
about
a
little
i
would
put
my
place
of
refuge
yet
a
little
farther
off
nibble
at
the
danger
as
it
were
a
danger
which
existed
only
in
my
imagination
i
went
outside
the
high
holly
hedge
and
the
house
was
hidden
a
grassy
field
was
before
me
and
just
beyond
the
field
rose
the
farm
buildings
why
should
not
i
run
across
and
wake
turkey
i
was
off
like
a
shot
the
expectation
of
a
companion
in
my
delight
overcoming
all
the
remnants
of
lingering
apprehension
i
knew
there
was
only
one
bolt
and
that
a
manageable
one
between
me
and
turkey
for
he
slept
in
a
little
wooden
chamber
partitioned
off
from
a
loft
in
the
barn
to
which
he
had
to
climb
a
ladder
the
only
fearful
part
was
the
crossing
of
the
but
i
was
man
enough
for
that
i
reached
and
crossed
the
yard
in
safety
searched
for
and
found
the
key
of
the
barn
which
was
always
left
in
a
hole
in
the
wall
by
the
door
turned
it
in
the
lock
and
crossed
the
floor
as
fast
as
the
darkness
would
allow
me
with
outstretched
groping
hands
i
found
the
ladder
ascended
and
stood
by
turkey
s
bed
turkey
turkey
wake
up
i
cried
it
s
such
a
beautiful
night
it
s
a
shame
to
lie
sleeping
that
turkey
s
answer
was
immediate
he
was
wide
awake
and
out
of
bed
with
all
his
wits
by
him
in
a
moment
sh
sh
he
said
or
you
ll
wake
oscar
was
a
colley
which
slept
in
a
kennel
in
the
cornyard
he
was
not
much
of
a
for
there
was
no
great
occasion
for
watching
and
he
knew
it
and
slept
like
a
human
child
but
he
was
the
most
knowing
of
dogs
turkey
was
proceeding
to
dress
never
mind
your
clothes
turkey
i
said
there
s
nobody
willing
enough
to
spare
himself
trouble
turkey
followed
me
in
his
shirt
but
once
we
were
out
in
the
cornyard
instead
of
finding
contentment
in
the
sky
and
the
moon
as
i
did
he
wanted
to
know
what
we
were
going
to
do
it
s
not
a
bad
sort
of
night
he
said
what
shall
we
do
with
it
he
was
always
wanting
to
do
something
oh
nothing
i
answered
only
look
about
us
a
you
didn
t
hear
robbers
did
you
he
asked
oh
dear
no
i
couldn
t
sleep
and
got
down
the
ladder
and
came
to
wake
you
that
s
let
s
have
a
walk
then
he
said
now
that
i
had
turkey
there
was
scarcely
more
terror
in
the
night
than
in
the
day
i
consented
at
once
that
we
had
no
shoes
on
was
not
of
the
least
consequence
to
scotch
boys
i
often
and
turkey
always
went
barefooted
in
summer
as
we
left
the
barn
turkey
had
caught
up
his
little
whip
he
was
never
to
be
seen
without
either
that
or
his
club
as
we
called
the
stick
he
carried
when
he
was
herding
the
cattle
finding
him
thus
armed
i
begged
him
to
give
me
his
club
he
ran
and
fetched
it
and
thus
equipped
we
set
out
for
nowhere
in
the
middle
of
the
night
my
fancy
was
full
of
fragmentary
notions
of
adventure
in
which
shadows
from
the
pilgrim
s
progress
predominated
i
shouldered
my
club
trying
to
persuade
my
imagination
that
the
unchristian
weapon
had
been
won
from
some
pagan
giant
and
therefore
was
not
unfittingly
carried
but
turkey
was
far
better
armed
with
his
lash
of
wire
than
i
was
with
the
club
his
little
whip
was
like
that
fearful
weapon
called
the
morning
star
in
the
hand
of
some
stalwart
knight
we
took
our
way
towards
the
nearest
hills
thinking
little
of
where
we
went
so
that
we
were
in
motion
i
guess
that
the
story
i
have
just
related
must
notwithstanding
his
unbelief
have
been
working
in
turkey
s
brain
that
night
for
after
we
had
walked
for
a
mile
or
more
along
the
road
and
had
arrived
at
the
foot
of
a
wooded
hill
well
known
to
all
the
children
of
the
neighbourhood
for
its
bilberries
he
turned
into
the
hollow
of
a
broken
track
which
lost
itself
in
a
field
as
yet
only
from
the
moorland
it
was
plain
to
me
now
that
turkey
had
some
goal
or
other
in
his
view
but
i
followed
his
leading
and
asked
no
questions
all
at
once
he
stopped
and
said
pointing
a
few
yards
in
front
of
him
look
ranald
i
did
look
but
the
moon
was
behind
the
hill
and
the
night
was
so
dim
that
i
had
to
keep
looking
for
several
moments
ere
i
discovered
that
he
was
pointing
to
the
dull
gleam
of
dark
water
very
horrible
it
seemed
i
felt
my
flesh
creep
the
instant
i
saw
it
it
lay
in
a
hollow
left
by
the
digging
out
of
peats
drained
thither
from
the
surrounding
bog
my
heart
sank
with
fear
the
almost
black
glimmer
of
its
surface
was
bad
enough
but
who
could
tell
what
lay
in
its
unknown
depth
but
as
i
gazed
almost
paralysed
a
huge
dark
figure
rose
up
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
pool
for
one
moment
the
scepticism
of
turkey
seemed
to
fail
him
for
he
cried
out
the
kelpie
the
kelpie
and
turned
and
ran
i
followed
as
fast
as
feet
utterly
unconscious
of
the
ground
they
trod
upon
could
bear
me
we
had
not
gone
many
yards
before
a
great
roar
filled
the
silent
air
that
moment
turkey
slackened
his
pace
and
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
it
s
nothing
but
bogbonny
s
bull
ranald
he
cried
kelpies
were
unknown
creatures
to
turkey
but
a
bull
was
no
more
than
a
dog
or
a
sheep
or
any
other
domestic
animal
i
however
did
not
share
his
equanimity
and
never
slackened
my
pace
till
i
got
up
with
him
but
he
s
rather
he
went
on
the
instant
i
joined
him
and
we
had
better
make
for
the
another
roar
was
a
fresh
spur
to
our
speed
we
could
not
have
been
in
better
trim
for
running
but
it
was
all
uphill
and
had
it
not
been
that
the
ground
for
some
distance
between
us
and
the
animal
was
boggy
so
that
he
had
to
go
round
a
good
way
one
of
us
at
least
would
have
been
in
evil
case
he
s
caught
sight
of
our
shirts
said
turkey
panting
as
he
ran
and
he
wants
to
see
what
they
are
but
we
ll
be
over
the
fence
before
he
comes
up
with
us
i
wouldn
t
mind
for
myself
i
could
dodge
him
well
enough
but
he
might
go
after
you
what
with
fear
and
exertion
i
was
unable
to
reply
another
bellow
sounded
nearer
and
by
and
by
we
could
hear
the
dull
stroke
of
his
hoofs
on
the
soft
ground
as
he
galloped
after
us
but
the
fence
of
dry
stones
and
the
larch
wood
within
it
were
close
at
hand
over
with
you
ranald
cried
turkey
as
if
with
his
last
breath
and
turned
at
bay
for
the
brute
was
close
behind
him
but
i
was
so
spent
i
could
not
climb
the
wall
and
when
i
saw
turkey
turn
and
face
the
bull
i
turned
too
we
were
now
in
the
shadow
of
the
hill
but
i
could
just
see
turkey
lift
his
arm
a
short
sharp
hiss
and
a
roar
followed
the
bull
tossed
his
head
as
in
pain
left
turkey
and
came
towards
me
he
could
not
charge
at
any
great
speed
for
the
ground
was
steep
and
uneven
i
too
had
kept
hold
of
my
weapon
and
although
i
was
dreadfully
frightened
i
felt
my
courage
rise
at
turkey
s
success
and
lifted
my
club
in
the
hope
that
it
might
prove
as
good
at
need
as
turkey
s
whip
it
was
well
for
me
however
that
turkey
was
too
quick
for
the
bull
he
got
between
him
and
me
and
a
second
stinging
cut
from
the
brass
wire
drew
a
second
roar
from
his
throat
and
no
doubt
a
second
red
streamlet
from
his
nose
while
my
club
descended
on
one
of
his
horns
with
a
bang
which
jarred
my
arm
to
the
elbow
and
sent
the
weapon
flying
over
the
fence
the
animal
turned
tail
for
a
moment
long
enough
to
place
us
enlivened
by
our
success
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
where
we
crouched
so
that
he
could
not
see
us
turkey
however
kept
looking
up
at
the
line
of
the
wall
against
the
sky
and
as
he
looked
over
came
the
nose
of
the
bull
within
a
yard
of
his
head
hiss
went
the
little
whip
and
bellow
went
the
bull
get
up
among
the
trees
ranald
for
fear
he
come
over
said
turkey
in
a
whisper
i
obeyed
but
as
he
could
see
nothing
of
his
foes
the
animal
had
had
enough
of
it
and
we
heard
no
more
of
him
after
a
while
turkey
left
his
lair
and
joined
me
we
rested
for
a
little
and
would
then
have
clambered
to
the
top
of
the
hill
but
we
gave
up
the
attempt
as
awkward
after
getting
into
a
furze
bush
in
our
condition
it
was
too
dark
i
began
to
grow
sleepy
also
and
thought
i
should
like
to
exchange
the
hillside
for
my
bed
turkey
made
no
objection
so
we
trudged
home
again
not
without
sundry
starts
and
quick
glances
to
make
sure
that
the
bull
was
neither
after
us
on
the
road
nor
watching
us
from
behind
this
bush
or
that
hillock
turkey
never
left
me
till
he
saw
me
safe
up
the
ladder
nay
after
i
was
in
bed
i
spied
his
face
peeping
in
at
the
window
from
the
topmost
round
of
it
by
this
time
the
east
had
begun
to
begin
to
glow
as
allister
who
was
painfully
exact
would
have
said
but
i
was
fairly
tired
now
and
falling
asleep
at
once
never
woke
until
mitchell
pulled
the
clothes
off
me
an
indignity
which
i
keenly
felt
but
did
not
yet
know
how
to
render
impossible
for
the
future
chapter
xiii
wandering
willie
illustration
at
that
time
there
were
a
good
many
beggars
going
about
the
country
who
lived
upon
the
alms
of
the
charitable
among
these
were
some
persons
who
although
not
to
be
relied
upon
were
seldom
to
any
extent
mischievous
we
were
not
much
afraid
of
them
for
the
is
a
charmed
spot
round
which
has
been
drawn
a
magic
circle
of
safety
and
we
seldom
roamed
far
beyond
it
there
was
however
one
occasional
visitor
of
this
class
of
whom
we
stood
in
some
degree
of
awe
he
was
commonly
styled
foolish
willie
his
approach
to
the
manse
was
always
announced
by
a
wailful
strain
upon
the
bagpipes
a
set
of
which
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
who
had
been
piper
to
some
highland
nobleman
at
least
so
it
was
said
willie
never
went
without
his
pipes
and
was
more
attached
to
them
than
to
any
living
creature
he
played
them
well
too
though
in
what
corner
he
kept
the
amount
of
intellect
necessary
to
the
mastery
of
them
was
a
puzzle
the
probability
seemed
that
his
wits
had
not
decayed
until
after
he
had
become
in
a
measure
proficient
in
the
use
of
the
chanter
as
they
call
that
pipe
by
means
of
whose
perforations
the
notes
are
regulated
however
this
may
be
willie
could
certainly
play
the
pipes
and
was
a
great
favourite
because
of
it
with
children
especially
notwithstanding
the
mixture
of
fear
which
his
presence
always
occasioned
them
whether
it
was
from
our
highland
blood
or
from
kirsty
s
stories
i
do
not
know
but
we
were
always
delighted
when
the
sound
of
his
pipes
reached
us
little
davie
would
dance
and
shout
with
glee
even
the
kelpie
mitchell
that
is
was
benignantly
inclined
towards
wandering
willie
as
some
people
called
him
after
the
old
song
so
much
so
that
turkey
who
always
tried
to
account
for
things
declared
his
conviction
that
willie
must
be
mitchell
s
brother
only
she
was
ashamed
and
wouldn
t
own
him
i
do
not
believe
he
had
the
smallest
atom
of
corroboration
for
the
conjecture
which
therefore
was
bold
and
worthy
of
the
inventor
one
thing
we
all
knew
that
she
would
ostentatiously
fill
the
canvas
bag
which
he
carried
by
his
side
with
any
broken
scraps
she
could
gather
would
give
him
as
much
milk
to
drink
as
he
pleased
and
would
speak
kind
almost
coaxing
words
to
the
poor
words
which
sounded
the
stranger
in
our
ears
that
they
were
quite
unused
to
like
sounds
from
the
lips
of
the
kelpie
it
is
impossible
to
describe
willie
s
dress
the
agglomeration
of
necessity
and
superfluous
whim
was
never
exceeded
his
pleasure
was
to
pin
on
his
person
whatever
cotton
handkerchiefs
he
could
get
hold
of
so
that
with
one
of
these
behind
and
one
before
spread
out
across
back
and
chest
he
always
looked
like
an
ancient
herald
come
with
a
message
from
knight
or
nobleman
so
incongruous
was
his
costume
that
i
could
never
tell
whether
kilt
or
trousers
was
the
original
foundation
upon
which
it
had
been
constructed
to
his
tatters
add
the
bits
of
old
ribbon
list
and
coloured
rag
which
he
attached
to
his
pipes
wherever
there
was
room
and
you
will
see
that
he
looked
all
flags
and
pennons
a
moving
grove
of
raggery
out
of
which
came
the
screaming
chant
and
drone
of
his
instrument
when
he
danced
he
was
like
a
whirlwind
that
had
caught
up
the
contents
of
an
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
should
have
produced
in
our
minds
an
indescribable
mixture
of
awe
and
delight
awe
because
no
one
could
tell
what
he
might
do
next
and
delight
because
of
his
oddity
agility
and
music
the
first
sensation
was
always
a
slight
fear
which
gradually
wore
off
as
we
became
anew
accustomed
to
the
strangeness
of
the
apparition
before
the
visit
was
over
wee
davie
would
be
playing
with
the
dangles
of
his
pipes
and
laying
his
ear
to
the
bag
out
of
which
he
thought
the
music
came
and
willie
was
particularly
fond
of
davie
and
tried
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
him
after
a
hundred
grotesque
fashions
the
awe
however
was
constantly
renewed
in
his
absence
partly
by
the
threats
of
the
kelpie
that
if
so
and
so
she
would
give
this
one
or
that
to
foolish
willie
to
take
away
with
him
a
threat
which
now
fell
almost
powerless
upon
me
but
still
told
upon
allister
and
davie
one
day
in
early
summer
it
was
after
i
had
begun
to
go
to
school
i
came
home
as
usual
at
five
o
clock
to
find
the
manse
in
great
commotion
wee
davie
had
disappeared
they
were
looking
for
him
everywhere
without
avail
already
all
the
farmhouses
had
been
thoroughly
searched
an
awful
horror
fell
upon
me
and
the
most
frightful
ideas
of
davie
s
fate
arose
in
my
mind
i
remember
giving
a
howl
of
dismay
the
moment
i
heard
of
the
catastrophe
for
which
i
received
a
sound
box
on
the
ear
from
mitchell
i
was
too
miserable
however
to
show
any
active
resentment
and
only
sat
down
upon
the
grass
and
cried
in
a
few
minutes
my
father
who
had
been
away
visiting
some
of
his
parishioners
rode
up
on
his
little
black
mare
mitchell
hurried
to
meet
him
wringing
her
hands
and
crying
oh
sir
oh
sir
davie
s
away
with
foolish
willie
this
was
the
first
i
had
heard
of
willie
in
connection
with
the
affair
my
father
turned
pale
but
kept
perfectly
quiet
which
way
did
he
go
he
asked
nobody
knew
how
long
is
it
ago
about
an
hour
and
a
half
i
think
said
mitchell
to
me
the
news
was
some
relief
now
i
could
at
least
do
something
i
left
the
group
and
hurried
away
to
find
turkey
except
my
father
i
trusted
more
in
turkey
than
in
anyone
i
got
on
a
rising
ground
near
the
manse
and
looked
all
about
until
i
found
where
the
cattle
were
feeding
that
afternoon
and
then
darted
off
at
full
speed
they
were
at
some
distance
from
home
and
i
found
that
turkey
had
heard
nothing
of
the
mishap
when
i
had
succeeded
in
conveying
the
dreadful
news
he
shouldered
his
club
and
said
the
cows
must
look
after
themselves
ranald
with
the
words
he
set
off
at
a
good
swinging
trot
in
the
direction
of
a
little
rocky
knoll
in
a
hollow
about
half
a
mile
away
which
he
knew
to
be
a
favourite
haunt
of
wandering
willie
as
often
as
he
came
into
the
neighbourhood
on
this
knoll
grew
some
stunted
trees
gnarled
and
old
with
very
mossy
stems
there
was
moss
on
the
stones
too
and
between
them
grew
lovely
harebells
and
at
the
foot
of
the
knoll
there
were
always
in
the
season
tall
foxgloves
which
had
imparted
a
certain
fear
to
the
spot
in
my
fancy
for
there
they
call
them
man
s
and
i
thought
there
was
a
murdered
man
buried
somewhere
thereabout
i
should
not
have
liked
to
be
there
alone
even
in
the
broad
daylight
but
with
turkey
i
would
have
gone
at
any
hour
even
without
the
impulse
which
now
urged
me
to
follow
him
at
my
best
speed
there
was
some
marshy
ground
between
us
and
the
knoll
but
we
floundered
through
it
and
then
turkey
who
was
some
distance
ahead
of
me
dropped
into
a
walk
and
began
to
reconnoitre
the
knoll
with
some
caution
i
soon
got
up
with
him
he
s
there
ranald
he
said
who
davie
i
don
t
know
about
davie
but
willie
s
how
do
you
know
i
heard
his
bagpipes
grunt
perhaps
davie
sat
down
upon
oh
run
turkey
i
said
eagerly
no
hurry
he
returned
if
willie
has
him
he
won
t
hurt
him
but
it
mayn
t
be
easy
to
get
him
away
we
must
creep
up
and
see
what
can
be
half
dead
as
some
of
the
trees
were
there
was
foliage
enough
upon
them
to
hide
willie
and
turkey
hoped
it
would
help
to
hide
our
approach
he
went
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
thus
crept
towards
the
knoll
skirting
it
partly
because
a
little
way
round
it
was
steeper
i
followed
his
example
and
found
i
was
his
match
at
crawling
in
fashion
when
we
reached
the
steep
side
we
lay
still
and
listened
he
s
there
i
cried
in
a
whisper
sh
said
turkey
i
hear
him
it
s
all
right
we
ll
soon
have
a
hold
of
a
weary
whimper
as
of
a
child
worn
out
with
hopeless
crying
had
reached
our
ears
turkey
immediately
began
to
climb
the
side
of
the
knoll
stay
where
you
are
ranald
he
said
i
can
go
up
quieter
than
i
obeyed
cautious
as
a
he
ascended
still
on
his
hands
and
knees
i
strained
my
eyes
after
his
every
motion
but
when
he
was
near
the
top
he
lay
perfectly
quiet
and
continued
so
till
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
crept
up
after
him
when
i
came
behind
him
he
looked
round
angrily
and
made
a
most
emphatic
contortion
of
his
face
after
which
i
dared
not
climb
to
a
level
with
him
but
lay
trembling
with
expectation
the
next
moment
i
heard
him
call
in
a
low
whisper
davie
davie
wee
davie
but
there
was
no
reply
he
called
a
little
louder
evidently
trying
to
reach
by
degrees
just
the
pitch
that
would
pierce
to
davie
s
ears
and
not
arrive
at
wandering
willie
s
who
i
rightly
presumed
was
farther
off
his
tones
grew
louder
and
louder
but
had
not
yet
risen
above
a
sharp
whisper
when
at
length
a
small
trembling
voice
cried
turkey
turkey
in
prolonged
accents
of
mingled
hope
and
pain
there
was
a
sound
in
the
bushes
above
me
a
louder
sound
and
a
rush
turkey
sprang
to
his
feet
and
vanished
i
followed
before
i
reached
the
top
there
came
a
despairing
cry
from
davie
and
a
shout
and
a
gabble
from
willie
then
followed
a
louder
shout
and
a
louder
gabble
mixed
with
a
scream
from
the
bagpipes
and
an
exulting
laugh
from
turkey
all
this
passed
in
the
moment
i
spent
in
getting
to
the
top
the
last
step
of
which
was
difficult
there
was
davie
alone
in
the
thicket
turkey
scudding
down
the
opposite
slope
with
the
bagpipes
under
his
arm
and
wandering
willie
pursuing
him
in
a
foaming
fury
i
caught
davie
in
my
arms
from
where
he
lay
sobbing
and
crying
yanal
yanal
and
stood
for
a
moment
not
knowing
what
to
do
but
resolved
to
fight
with
teeth
and
nails
before
willie
should
take
him
again
meantime
turkey
led
willie
towards
the
deepest
of
the
boggy
ground
in
which
both
were
very
soon
floundering
only
turkey
being
the
lighter
had
the
advantage
when
i
saw
that
i
resolved
to
make
for
home
i
got
davie
on
my
back
and
slid
down
the
farther
side
to
skirt
the
bog
for
i
knew
i
should
stick
in
it
with
davie
s
weight
added
to
my
own
i
had
not
gone
far
however
before
a
howl
from
willie
made
me
aware
that
he
had
caught
sight
of
us
and
looking
round
i
saw
him
turn
from
turkey
and
come
after
us
presently
however
he
hesitated
then
stopped
and
began
looking
this
way
and
that
from
the
one
to
the
other
of
his
treasures
both
in
evil
hands
doubtless
his
indecision
would
have
been
very
ludicrous
to
anyone
who
had
not
such
a
stake
in
the
turn
of
the
scale
as
it
was
he
made
up
his
mind
far
too
soon
for
he
chose
to
follow
davie
i
ran
my
best
in
the
very
strength
of
despair
for
some
distance
but
seeing
very
soon
that
i
had
no
chance
i
set
davie
down
telling
him
to
keep
behind
me
and
prepared
like
the
knight
of
the
red
cross
sad
battle
to
darrayne
willie
came
on
in
fury
his
rags
fluttering
like
ten
scarecrows
and
he
waving
his
arms
in
the
air
with
wild
gestures
and
grimaces
and
cries
and
curses
he
was
more
terrible
than
the
bull
and
turkey
was
behind
him
i
was
just
like
a
negro
preparing
to
run
my
head
into
the
pit
of
his
stomach
and
so
upset
him
if
i
could
when
i
saw
turkey
running
towards
us
at
full
speed
blowing
into
the
bagpipes
as
he
ran
how
he
found
breath
for
both
i
can
not
understand
at
length
he
put
the
bag
under
his
arm
and
forth
issued
such
a
combination
of
screeching
and
grunting
and
howling
that
wandering
willie
in
the
full
career
of
his
rage
turned
at
the
cries
of
his
companion
then
came
turkey
s
masterpiece
he
dashed
the
bagpipes
on
the
ground
and
commenced
kicking
them
before
him
like
a
football
and
the
pipes
cried
out
at
every
kick
if
turkey
s
first
object
had
been
their
utter
demolition
he
could
not
have
treated
them
more
unmercifully
it
was
no
time
for
gentle
measures
my
life
hung
in
the
balance
but
this
was
more
than
willie
could
bear
he
turned
from
us
and
once
again
pursued
his
pipes
when
he
had
nearly
overtaken
him
turkey
gave
them
a
last
masterly
kick
which
sent
them
flying
through
the
air
caught
them
as
they
fell
and
again
sought
the
bog
while
i
hoisting
davie
on
my
back
hurried
with
more
haste
than
speed
towards
the
manse
illustration
what
took
place
after
i
left
them
i
have
only
from
turkey
s
report
for
i
never
looked
behind
me
till
i
reached
the
little
green
before
the
house
where
setting
davie
down
i
threw
myself
on
the
grass
i
remember
nothing
more
till
i
came
to
myself
in
bed
when
turkey
reached
the
bog
and
had
got
wandering
willie
well
into
the
middle
of
it
he
threw
the
bagpipes
as
far
beyond
him
as
he
could
and
then
made
his
way
out
willie
followed
the
pipes
took
them
held
them
up
between
him
and
the
sky
as
if
appealing
to
heaven
against
the
cruelty
then
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
the
bog
upon
a
solitary
hump
and
cried
like
a
child
turkey
stood
and
watched
him
at
first
with
feelings
of
triumph
which
by
slow
degrees
cooled
down
until
at
length
they
passed
over
into
compassion
and
he
grew
heartily
sorry
for
the
poor
fellow
although
there
was
no
room
for
repentance
after
willie
had
cried
for
a
while
he
took
the
instrument
as
if
it
had
been
the
mangled
corpse
of
his
son
and
proceeded
to
examine
it
turkey
declared
his
certainty
that
none
of
the
pipes
were
broken
but
when
at
length
willie
put
the
mouthpiece
to
his
lips
and
began
to
blow
into
the
bag
alas
it
would
hold
no
wind
he
flung
it
from
him
in
anger
and
cried
again
turkey
left
him
crying
in
the
middle
of
the
bog
he
said
it
was
a
pitiful
sight
it
was
long
before
willie
appeared
in
that
part
of
the
country
again
but
about
six
months
after
some
neighbours
who
had
been
to
a
fair
twenty
miles
off
told
my
father
that
they
had
seen
him
looking
much
as
usual
and
playing
his
pipes
with
more
energy
than
ever
this
was
a
great
relief
to
my
father
who
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
the
poor
fellow
s
loneliness
without
his
pipes
and
had
wanted
very
much
to
get
them
repaired
for
him
but
ever
after
my
father
showed
a
great
regard
for
turkey
i
heard
him
say
once
that
if
he
had
had
the
chance
turkey
would
have
made
a
great
general
that
he
should
be
judged
capable
of
so
much
was
not
surprising
to
me
yet
he
became
in
consequence
a
still
greater
being
in
my
eyes
when
i
set
davie
down
and
fell
myself
on
the
grass
there
was
nobody
near
everyone
was
engaged
in
a
new
search
for
davie
my
father
had
rode
off
at
once
without
dismounting
to
inquire
at
the
neighbouring
whether
willie
had
passed
through
it
was
not
very
likely
for
such
wanderers
seldom
take
to
the
hard
high
road
but
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
it
was
better
to
do
something
having
failed
there
he
had
returned
and
ridden
along
the
country
road
which
passed
the
farm
towards
the
hills
leaving
willie
and
davie
far
behind
him
it
was
twilight
before
he
returned
how
long
therefore
i
lay
upon
the
grass
i
do
not
know
when
i
came
to
myself
i
found
a
sharp
pain
in
my
side
turn
how
i
would
there
it
was
and
i
could
draw
but
a
very
short
breath
for
it
i
was
in
my
father
s
bed
and
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
i
lay
for
some
time
in
increasing
pain
but
in
a
little
while
my
father
came
in
and
then
i
felt
that
all
was
as
it
should
be
seeing
me
awake
he
approached
with
an
anxious
face
is
davie
all
right
father
i
asked
he
is
quite
well
ranald
my
boy
how
do
you
feel
yourself
now
i
ve
been
asleep
father
yes
we
found
you
on
the
grass
with
davie
pulling
at
you
and
trying
to
wake
you
crying
yanal
won
t
peak
to
me
yanal
yanal
i
am
afraid
you
had
a
terrible
run
with
him
turkey
as
you
call
him
told
me
all
about
it
he
s
a
fine
lad
turkey
indeed
he
is
father
i
cried
with
a
gasp
which
betrayed
my
suffering
what
is
the
matter
my
boy
he
asked
lift
me
up
a
little
please
i
said
i
have
a
pain
in
my
side
ah
he
said
it
catches
your
breath
we
must
send
for
the
old
the
old
doctor
was
a
sort
of
demigod
in
the
place
everybody
believed
and
trusted
in
him
and
nobody
could
die
in
peace
without
him
any
more
than
without
my
father
i
was
delighted
at
the
thought
of
being
his
patient
i
think
i
see
him
now
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
taking
his
lancet
from
his
pocket
while
preparations
were
being
made
for
bleeding
me
at
the
arm
which
was
a
far
commoner
operation
then
than
it
is
now
that
night
i
was
delirious
and
haunted
with
bagpipes
wandering
willie
was
nowhere
but
the
atmosphere
was
full
of
bagpipes
it
was
an
unremitting
storm
of
bagpipes
silent
but
assailing
me
bodily
from
all
quarters
now
small
as
motes
in
the
sun
and
hailing
upon
me
now
large
as
and
ready
to
bang
us
about
only
they
never
touched
us
now
huge
as
mount
ætna
and
threatening
to
smother
us
beneath
their
ponderous
bulk
for
all
the
time
i
was
toiling
on
with
little
davie
on
my
back
next
day
i
was
a
little
better
but
very
weak
and
it
was
many
days
before
i
was
able
to
get
out
of
bed
my
father
soon
found
that
it
would
not
do
to
let
mitchell
attend
upon
me
for
i
was
always
worse
after
she
had
been
in
the
room
for
any
time
so
he
got
another
woman
to
take
kirsty
s
duties
and
set
her
to
nurse
me
after
which
illness
became
almost
a
luxury
with
kirsty
near
nothing
could
go
wrong
and
the
growing
better
was
pure
enjoyment
once
when
kirsty
was
absent
for
a
little
while
mitchell
brought
me
some
gruel
the
gruel
s
not
nice
i
said
it
s
perfectly
good
ranald
and
there
s
no
merit
in
complaining
when
everybody
s
trying
to
make
you
as
comfortable
as
they
can
said
the
kelpie
let
me
taste
it
said
kirsty
who
that
moment
entered
the
it
s
not
fit
for
anybody
to
eat
she
said
and
carried
it
away
mitchell
following
her
with
her
nose
horizontal
kirsty
brought
the
basin
back
full
of
delicious
gruel
well
boiled
and
supplemented
with
cream
i
am
sure
the
way
in
which
she
transformed
that
basin
of
gruel
has
been
a
lesson
to
me
ever
since
as
to
the
quality
of
the
work
i
did
no
boy
or
girl
can
have
a
much
better
lesson
than
to
do
what
must
be
done
as
well
as
it
can
be
done
everything
the
commonest
well
done
is
something
for
the
progress
of
the
world
that
is
lessens
if
by
the
smallest
hair
the
distance
between
it
and
god
oh
what
a
delight
was
that
first
glowing
summer
afternoon
upon
which
i
was
carried
out
to
the
field
where
turkey
was
herding
the
cattle
i
could
not
yet
walk
that
very
morning
as
i
was
being
dressed
by
kirsty
i
had
insisted
that
i
could
walk
quite
well
and
kirsty
had
been
into
letting
me
try
not
feeling
steady
on
my
legs
i
set
off
running
but
tumbled
on
my
knees
by
the
first
chair
i
came
near
i
was
so
light
from
the
wasting
of
my
illness
that
kirsty
herself
little
woman
as
she
was
was
able
to
carry
me
i
remember
well
how
i
saw
everything
double
that
day
and
found
it
at
first
very
amusing
kirsty
set
me
down
on
a
plaid
in
the
grass
and
the
next
moment
turkey
looking
awfully
big
and
portentously
healthy
stood
by
my
side
i
wish
i
might
give
the
conversation
in
the
dialect
of
my
native
country
for
it
loses
much
in
translation
but
i
have
promised
and
i
will
keep
my
promise
eh
ranald
said
turkey
it
s
not
yourself
it
s
me
turkey
i
said
nearly
crying
with
pleasure
never
mind
ranald
he
returned
as
if
consoling
me
in
some
disappointment
we
ll
have
rare
fun
i
m
frightened
at
the
cows
turkey
don
t
let
them
come
near
no
that
i
won
t
answered
turkey
brandishing
his
club
to
give
me
confidence
ll
give
it
them
if
they
look
at
you
from
between
their
ugly
turkey
i
said
for
i
had
often
pondered
the
matter
during
my
illness
how
did
hawkie
behave
while
you
were
away
with
me
that
day
you
know
she
ate
about
half
a
rick
of
green
corn
answered
turkey
coolly
but
she
had
the
worst
of
it
they
had
to
make
a
hole
in
her
side
or
she
would
have
died
there
she
is
off
to
the
turnips
he
was
after
her
with
shout
and
flourish
hawkie
heard
and
obeyed
turning
round
on
her
with
a
sudden
start
for
she
knew
from
his
voice
that
he
was
in
a
dangerously
energetic
mood
you
ll
be
all
right
again
soon
he
said
coming
quietly
back
to
me
kirsty
had
gone
to
the
farmhouse
leaving
me
with
injunctions
to
turkey
concerning
me
oh
yes
i
m
nearly
well
now
only
i
can
t
walk
will
you
come
on
my
back
he
said
when
kirsty
returned
to
take
me
home
there
was
i
following
the
cows
on
turkey
s
back
riding
him
about
wherever
i
chose
for
my
horse
was
obedient
as
only
a
dog
or
a
horse
or
a
servant
from
love
can
be
from
that
day
i
recovered
very
rapidly
chapter
xiv
elsie
duff
how
all
the
boys
and
girls
stared
at
me
as
timidly
yet
with
a
sense
of
importance
derived
from
the
distinction
of
having
been
so
ill
i
entered
the
parish
school
one
morning
about
ten
o
clock
for
as
i
said
before
i
had
gone
to
school
for
some
months
before
i
was
taken
ill
it
was
a
very
different
affair
from
dame
shand
s
tyrannical
little
kingdom
here
were
boys
of
all
ages
and
girls
likewise
ruled
over
by
an
energetic
young
man
with
a
touch
of
genius
manifested
chiefly
in
an
enthusiasm
for
teaching
he
had
spoken
to
me
kindly
the
first
day
i
went
and
had
so
secured
my
attachment
that
it
never
wavered
not
even
when
once
supposing
me
guilty
of
a
certain
breach
of
orders
committed
by
my
next
neighbour
he
called
me
up
and
with
more
severity
than
usual
ordered
me
to
hold
up
my
hand
the
lash
stung
me
dreadfully
but
i
was
able
to
smile
in
his
face
notwithstanding
i
could
not
have
done
that
had
i
been
guilty
he
dropped
his
hand
already
lifted
for
the
second
blow
and
sent
me
back
to
my
seat
i
suppose
either
his
heart
interfered
or
he
saw
that
i
was
not
in
need
of
more
punishment
the
greatest
good
he
did
me
one
for
which
i
shall
be
ever
grateful
was
the
rousing
in
me
of
a
love
for
english
literature
especially
poetry
but
i
can
not
linger
upon
this
at
present
tempting
although
it
be
i
have
led
a
busy
life
in
the
world
since
but
it
has
been
one
of
my
greatest
comforts
when
the
work
of
the
day
was
over
dry
work
if
it
had
not
been
that
i
had
it
to
do
to
return
to
my
books
and
live
in
the
company
of
those
who
were
greater
than
myself
and
had
had
a
higher
work
in
life
than
mine
the
master
used
to
say
that
a
man
was
fit
company
for
any
man
whom
he
could
understand
and
therefore
i
hope
often
that
some
day
in
some
future
condition
of
existence
i
may
look
upon
the
faces
of
milton
and
bacon
and
shakspere
whose
writings
have
given
me
so
much
strength
and
hope
throughout
my
life
here
the
moment
he
saw
me
the
master
came
up
to
me
and
took
me
by
the
hand
saying
he
was
glad
to
see
me
able
to
come
to
school
again
you
must
not
try
to
do
too
much
at
first
he
added
this
set
me
on
my
mettle
and
i
worked
hard
and
with
some
success
but
before
the
morning
was
over
i
grew
very
tired
and
fell
fast
asleep
with
my
head
on
the
desk
i
was
informed
afterwards
that
the
master
had
interfered
when
one
of
my
was
trying
to
wake
me
and
told
him
to
let
me
sleep
when
one
o
clock
came
i
was
roused
by
the
noise
of
dismissal
for
the
two
hours
for
dinner
i
staggered
out
still
stupid
with
sleep
and
whom
should
i
find
watching
for
me
by
the
but
turkey
turkey
i
exclaimed
you
here
yes
ranald
he
said
i
ve
put
the
cows
up
for
an
hour
or
two
for
it
was
very
hot
and
kirsty
said
i
might
come
and
carry
you
so
saying
he
stooped
before
me
and
took
me
on
his
strong
back
as
soon
as
i
was
well
settled
he
turned
his
head
and
said
ranald
i
should
like
to
go
and
have
a
look
at
my
mother
will
you
come
there
s
plenty
of
yes
please
turkey
i
answered
i
ve
never
seen
your
he
set
off
at
a
slow
easy
trot
and
bore
me
through
street
and
lane
until
we
arrived
at
a
house
in
the
roof
of
which
his
mother
lived
she
was
a
widow
and
had
only
turkey
what
a
curious
place
her
little
garret
was
the
roof
sloped
down
on
one
side
to
the
very
floor
and
there
was
a
little
window
in
it
from
which
i
could
see
away
to
the
manse
a
mile
off
and
far
beyond
it
her
bed
stood
in
one
corner
with
a
check
curtain
hung
from
a
rafter
in
front
of
it
in
another
was
a
chest
which
contained
all
their
spare
clothes
including
turkey
s
best
garments
which
he
went
home
to
put
on
every
sunday
morning
in
the
little
grate
smouldered
a
fire
of
from
which
all
the
astringent
virtue
had
been
extracted
in
the
pits
at
the
lanyard
and
which
was
given
to
the
poor
for
nothing
turkey
s
mother
was
sitting
near
the
little
window
spinning
she
was
a
spare
thin
woman
with
loving
eyes
and
slow
speech
johnnie
she
exclaimed
what
brings
you
here
and
who
s
this
you
ve
brought
with
you
instead
of
stopping
her
work
as
she
spoke
she
made
her
wheel
go
faster
than
before
and
i
gazed
with
admiration
at
her
deft
fingering
of
the
wool
from
which
the
thread
flowed
in
a
continuous
line
as
if
it
had
been
something
plastic
towards
the
revolving
spool
it
s
ranald
bannerman
said
turkey
quietly
i
m
his
horse
i
m
taking
him
home
from
the
school
this
is
the
first
time
he
s
been
there
since
he
was
hearing
this
she
relaxed
her
labour
and
the
hooks
which
had
been
revolving
so
fast
that
they
were
invisible
in
a
mist
of
motion
began
to
dawn
into
form
until
at
length
they
revealed
their
shape
and
at
last
stood
quite
still
she
rose
and
said
come
master
ranald
and
sit
down
you
ll
be
tired
of
riding
such
a
rough
horse
as
no
indeed
i
said
turkey
is
not
a
rough
horse
he
s
the
best
horse
in
the
he
always
calls
me
turkey
mother
because
of
my
nose
said
turkey
laughing
and
what
brings
you
here
asked
his
mother
this
is
not
on
the
road
to
the
i
wanted
to
see
if
you
were
better
but
what
becomes
of
the
cows
oh
they
re
all
safe
enough
they
know
i
m
well
sit
down
and
rest
you
both
she
said
resuming
her
own
place
at
the
wheel
i
m
glad
to
see
you
johnnie
so
be
your
work
is
not
neglected
i
must
go
on
with
thereupon
turkey
who
had
stood
waiting
his
mother
s
will
deposited
me
upon
her
bed
and
sat
down
beside
me
and
how
s
your
papa
the
good
man
she
said
to
me
i
told
her
he
was
quite
well
all
the
better
that
you
re
restored
from
the
grave
i
don
t
doubt
she
said
i
had
never
known
before
that
i
had
been
in
any
danger
it
s
been
a
sore
time
for
him
and
you
too
she
added
you
must
be
a
good
son
to
him
ranald
for
he
was
in
a
great
way
about
you
they
tell
turkey
said
nothing
and
i
was
too
much
surprised
to
know
what
to
say
for
as
often
as
my
father
had
come
into
my
room
he
had
always
looked
cheerful
and
i
had
had
no
idea
that
he
was
uneasy
about
me
after
a
little
more
talk
turkey
rose
and
said
we
must
be
going
well
ranald
said
his
mother
you
must
come
and
see
me
any
time
when
you
re
tired
at
the
school
and
you
can
lie
down
and
rest
yourself
a
bit
be
a
good
lad
johnnie
and
mind
your
yes
mother
i
ll
try
answered
turkey
cheerfully
as
he
hoisted
me
once
more
upon
his
back
good
day
mother
he
added
and
left
the
room
i
mention
this
little
incident
because
it
led
to
other
things
afterwards
i
rode
home
upon
turkey
s
back
and
with
my
father
s
leave
instead
of
returning
to
school
that
day
spent
the
afternoon
in
the
fields
with
turkey
in
the
middle
of
the
field
where
the
cattle
were
that
day
there
was
a
large
circular
mound
i
have
often
thought
since
that
it
must
have
been
a
barrow
with
dead
men
s
bones
in
the
heart
of
it
but
no
such
suspicion
had
then
crossed
my
mind
its
sides
were
rather
steep
and
covered
with
lovely
grass
on
the
side
farthest
from
the
manse
and
without
one
human
dwelling
in
sight
turkey
and
i
lay
that
afternoon
in
a
bliss
enhanced
to
me
i
am
afraid
by
the
contrasted
thought
of
the
close
hot
dusty
schoolroom
where
my
were
talking
laughing
and
wrangling
or
perhaps
trying
to
work
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
of
disinclination
a
fitful
little
breeze
as
if
itself
subject
to
the
influence
of
the
heat
would
wake
up
for
a
few
moments
wave
a
few
heads
of
waft
a
few
strains
of
odour
from
the
blossoms
of
the
white
clover
and
then
die
away
fatigued
with
the
effort
turkey
took
out
his
jews
harp
and
discoursed
soothing
if
not
eloquent
strains
at
our
feet
a
few
yards
from
the
mound
ran
a
babbling
brook
which
divided
our
farm
from
the
next
those
of
my
readers
whose
ears
are
open
to
the
music
of
nature
must
have
observed
how
different
are
the
songs
sung
by
different
brooks
some
are
a
mere
tinkling
others
are
sweet
as
silver
bells
with
a
tone
besides
which
no
bell
ever
had
some
sing
in
a
careless
defiant
tone
this
one
sung
in
a
veiled
voice
a
contralto
muffled
in
the
hollows
of
overhanging
banks
with
a
low
deep
musical
gurgle
in
some
of
the
stony
eddies
in
which
a
straw
would
float
for
days
and
nights
till
a
flood
came
borne
round
and
round
in
a
whirlpool
the
brook
was
deep
for
its
size
and
had
a
good
deal
to
say
in
a
solemn
tone
for
such
a
small
stream
we
lay
on
the
side
of
the
hillock
i
say
and
turkey
s
jews
harp
mingled
its
sounds
with
those
of
the
brook
after
a
while
he
laid
it
aside
and
we
were
both
silent
for
a
time
at
length
turkey
spoke
you
ve
seen
my
mother
yes
she
s
all
i
ve
got
to
look
i
haven
t
got
any
mother
to
look
after
no
you
ve
a
father
to
look
after
you
i
must
do
it
you
know
my
father
wasn
t
over
good
to
my
mother
he
used
to
get
drunk
sometimes
and
then
he
was
very
rough
with
her
i
must
make
it
up
to
her
as
well
as
i
can
she
s
not
well
off
isn
t
she
turkey
no
she
works
very
hard
at
her
spinning
and
no
one
spins
better
than
my
mother
how
could
they
but
it
s
very
poor
pay
you
know
and
she
ll
be
getting
old
by
and
not
no
not
nor
the
day
after
said
turkey
looking
up
with
some
surprise
to
see
what
i
meant
by
the
remark
he
then
discovered
that
my
eyes
had
led
my
thoughts
astray
and
that
what
he
had
been
saying
about
his
mother
had
got
no
farther
than
into
my
ears
for
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
on
the
grass
like
a
shepherdess
in
an
old
picture
sat
a
young
girl
about
my
own
age
in
the
midst
of
a
crowded
colony
of
daisies
and
white
clover
knitting
so
that
her
needles
went
as
fast
as
kirsty
s
and
were
nearly
as
invisible
as
the
thing
with
the
hooked
teeth
in
it
that
looked
so
dangerous
and
ran
itself
out
of
sight
upon
turkey
s
mother
s
a
little
way
from
her
was
a
fine
cow
feeding
with
a
long
iron
chain
dragging
after
her
the
girl
was
too
far
off
for
me
to
see
her
face
very
distinctly
but
something
in
her
shape
her
posture
and
the
hang
of
her
head
i
do
not
know
what
had
attracted
me
oh
there
s
elsie
duff
said
turkey
himself
forgetting
his
mother
in
the
sight
with
her
granny
s
cow
i
didn
t
know
she
was
coming
here
illustration
how
is
it
i
asked
that
she
is
feeding
her
on
old
james
joss
s
land
oh
they
re
very
good
to
elsie
you
see
nobody
cares
much
about
her
grandmother
but
elsie
s
not
her
grandmother
and
although
the
cow
belongs
to
the
old
woman
yet
for
elsie
s
sake
this
one
here
and
that
one
there
gives
her
a
bite
for
it
that
s
a
day
s
feed
generally
if
you
look
at
the
cow
you
ll
see
she
s
not
like
one
that
feeds
by
the
roadsides
she
s
as
plump
as
needful
and
has
a
good
udderful
of
milk
i
ll
run
down
and
tell
her
she
may
bring
the
cow
into
this
field
i
said
rising
i
would
if
it
were
said
turkey
in
a
marked
tone
which
i
understood
oh
i
see
turkey
i
said
you
mean
i
ought
to
ask
my
yes
to
be
sure
i
do
mean
that
answered
turkey
then
it
s
as
good
as
done
i
returned
i
will
ask
him
she
s
a
good
girl
elsie
was
all
turkey
s
reply
how
it
happened
i
can
not
now
remember
but
i
know
that
after
all
i
did
not
ask
my
father
and
granny
gregson
s
cow
had
no
bite
either
off
the
glebe
or
the
farm
and
turkey
s
reflections
concerning
the
mother
he
had
to
take
care
of
having
been
interrupted
the
end
to
which
they
were
moving
remained
for
the
present
unuttered
i
soon
grew
quite
strong
again
and
had
neither
plea
nor
desire
for
exemption
from
school
labours
my
father
also
had
begun
to
take
me
in
hand
as
well
as
my
brother
tom
and
what
with
arithmetic
and
latin
together
not
to
mention
geography
and
history
i
had
quite
enough
to
do
and
quite
as
much
also
as
was
good
for
me
chapter
xv
a
new
companion
illustration
during
this
summer
i
made
the
acquaintance
at
school
of
a
boy
called
peter
mason
peter
was
a
clever
boy
from
whose
merry
eye
a
sparkle
was
always
ready
to
break
he
seldom
knew
his
lesson
well
but
when
for
not
knowing
it
had
always
learned
it
before
any
of
the
rest
had
got
more
than
half
through
amongst
those
of
his
own
standing
he
was
the
acknowledged
leader
in
the
playground
and
was
besides
often
invited
to
take
a
share
in
the
amusements
of
the
older
boys
by
whom
he
was
petted
because
of
his
cleverness
and
obliging
disposition
beyond
school
hours
he
spent
his
time
in
all
manner
of
pranks
in
the
hot
summer
weather
he
would
bathe
twenty
times
a
day
and
was
as
much
at
home
in
the
water
as
any
dabchick
and
that
was
how
i
came
to
be
more
with
him
than
was
good
for
me
there
was
a
small
river
not
far
from
my
father
s
house
which
at
a
certain
point
was
dammed
back
by
a
weir
of
large
stones
to
turn
part
of
it
aside
into
a
the
mill
stood
a
little
way
down
under
a
steep
bank
it
was
almost
surrounded
with
trees
willows
by
the
water
s
edge
and
birches
and
larches
up
the
bank
above
the
dam
was
a
fine
spot
for
bathing
for
you
could
get
any
depth
you
liked
from
two
feet
to
five
or
six
and
here
it
was
that
most
of
the
boys
of
the
village
bathed
and
i
with
them
i
can
not
recall
the
memory
of
those
summer
days
without
a
gush
of
delight
gurgling
over
my
heart
just
as
the
water
used
to
gurgle
over
the
stones
of
the
dam
it
was
a
quiet
place
particularly
on
the
side
to
which
my
father
s
farm
went
down
where
it
was
sheltered
by
the
same
little
wood
which
farther
on
surrounded
the
mill
the
field
which
bordered
the
river
was
kept
in
natural
grass
thick
and
short
and
fine
for
here
on
the
bank
it
grew
well
although
such
grass
was
not
at
all
common
in
that
part
of
the
country
upon
other
parts
of
the
same
farm
the
grass
was
sown
every
year
along
with
the
corn
oh
the
summer
days
with
the
hot
sun
drawing
the
odours
from
the
feathery
larches
and
the
birches
when
getting
out
of
the
water
i
would
lie
in
the
warm
soft
grass
where
now
and
then
the
tenderest
little
breeze
would
creep
over
my
skin
until
the
sun
baking
me
more
than
was
pleasant
i
would
rouse
myself
with
an
effort
and
running
down
to
the
fringe
of
rushes
that
bordered
the
river
plunge
again
headlong
into
the
quiet
brown
water
and
dabble
and
swim
till
i
was
once
more
weary
for
innocent
animal
delight
i
know
of
nothing
to
match
those
days
so
warm
yet
so
so
clean
so
glad
i
often
think
how
god
must
love
his
little
children
to
have
invented
for
them
such
delights
for
of
course
if
he
did
not
love
the
children
and
delight
in
their
pleasure
he
would
not
have
invented
the
two
and
brought
them
together
yes
my
child
i
know
what
you
would
say
how
many
there
are
who
have
no
such
pleasures
i
grant
it
sorrowfully
but
you
must
remember
that
god
has
not
done
with
them
yet
and
besides
that
there
are
more
pleasures
in
the
world
than
you
or
i
know
anything
about
and
if
we
had
it
pleasure
i
know
i
should
not
care
so
much
about
what
is
better
and
i
would
rather
be
made
good
than
have
any
other
pleasure
in
the
world
and
so
would
you
though
perhaps
you
do
not
know
it
yet
one
day
a
good
many
of
us
were
at
the
water
together
i
was
somebody
amongst
them
in
my
own
estimation
because
i
bathed
off
my
father
s
ground
while
they
were
all
on
a
piece
of
bank
on
the
other
side
which
was
regarded
as
common
to
the
village
suddenly
upon
the
latter
spot
when
they
were
all
undressed
and
some
already
in
the
water
appeared
a
man
who
had
lately
rented
the
property
of
which
that
was
part
accompanied
by
a
dog
with
a
nose
and
a
villainous
look
a
mongrel
in
which
the
bull
predominated
he
ordered
everyone
off
his
premises
invaded
with
terror
all
except
a
big
boy
who
trusted
that
the
dog
would
be
more
frightened
at
his
naked
figure
than
he
was
at
the
dog
plunged
into
the
river
and
swam
or
waded
from
the
inhospitable
shore
once
in
the
embrace
of
the
stream
some
of
them
thoughtlessly
turned
and
mocked
the
enemy
forgetting
how
much
they
were
still
in
his
power
indignant
at
the
tyrant
i
stood
up
in
the
limpid
wave
and
assured
the
aquatic
company
of
a
welcome
to
the
opposite
bank
so
far
all
was
very
well
but
their
clothes
they
alas
were
upon
the
bank
they
had
left
the
spirit
of
a
host
was
upon
me
for
now
i
regarded
them
all
as
my
guests
you
come
ashore
when
you
like
i
said
i
will
see
what
can
be
done
about
your
i
knew
that
just
below
the
dam
lay
a
little
boat
built
by
the
miller
s
sons
it
was
clumsy
enough
but
in
my
eyes
a
marvel
of
engineering
art
on
the
opposite
side
stood
the
big
boy
braving
the
cur
which
barked
and
growled
at
him
with
its
ugly
head
stretched
out
like
a
serpent
s
while
his
owner
who
was
probably
not
so
unkind
as
we
thought
him
stood
enjoying
the
fun
of
it
all
reckoning
upon
the
big
boy
s
assistance
i
scrambled
out
of
the
water
and
sped
like
achilles
of
the
swift
foot
for
the
boat
i
jumped
in
and
seized
the
oars
intending
to
row
across
and
get
the
big
boy
to
throw
the
clothes
of
the
party
into
the
boat
but
i
had
never
handled
an
oar
in
my
life
and
in
the
middle
passage
how
it
happened
i
can
not
tell
i
found
myself
floundering
in
the
water
now
although
you
might
expect
that
the
water
being
dammed
back
just
here
it
would
be
shallow
below
the
dam
it
was
just
the
opposite
had
the
bottom
been
hard
it
would
have
been
shallow
but
as
the
bottom
was
soft
and
muddy
the
rush
of
the
water
over
the
dam
in
the
had
here
made
a
great
hollow
there
was
besides
another
weir
a
very
little
way
below
which
again
dammed
the
water
back
so
that
the
depth
was
greater
here
than
in
almost
any
other
part
within
the
ken
of
the
village
boys
indeed
there
were
horrors
afloat
concerning
its
depth
i
was
but
a
poor
swimmer
for
swimming
is
a
natural
gift
and
is
not
equally
distributed
to
all
i
might
have
done
better
however
but
for
those
stories
of
the
awful
gulf
beneath
me
i
was
struggling
and
floundering
and
quite
deaf
with
a
sense
of
the
water
constantly
getting
up
and
stopping
me
whatever
i
wanted
to
do
when
i
felt
myself
laid
hold
of
by
the
leg
dragged
under
water
and
a
moment
after
landed
safe
on
the
bank
almost
the
same
moment
i
heard
a
plunge
and
getting
up
staggering
and
bewildered
saw
as
through
the
haze
of
a
dream
a
boy
swimming
after
the
boat
which
had
gone
down
with
the
slow
current
i
saw
him
overtake
it
scramble
into
it
in
midstream
and
handle
the
oars
as
to
the
manner
born
when
he
had
brought
it
back
to
the
spot
where
i
stood
i
knew
that
peter
mason
was
my
deliverer
quite
recovered
by
this
time
from
my
slight
attack
of
drowning
i
got
again
into
the
boat
and
leaving
the
oars
to
peter
was
rowed
across
and
landed
there
was
no
further
difficulty
the
man
alarmed
i
suppose
at
the
danger
i
had
run
recalled
his
dog
we
bundled
in
the
clothes
peter
rowed
them
across
rory
the
big
boy
took
the
water
after
the
boat
and
i
plunged
in
again
above
the
dam
for
the
whole
of
that
summer
and
part
of
the
following
winter
peter
was
my
hero
to
the
forgetting
even
of
my
friend
turkey
i
took
every
opportunity
of
joining
him
in
his
games
partly
from
gratitude
partly
from
admiration
but
more
than
either
from
the
simple
human
attraction
of
the
boy
it
was
some
time
before
he
led
me
into
any
real
mischief
but
it
came
at
last
chapter
xvi
i
go
down
hill
it
came
in
the
following
winter
my
father
had
now
begun
to
teach
me
as
well
as
tom
but
i
confess
i
did
not
then
value
the
privilege
i
had
got
much
too
fond
of
the
society
of
peter
mason
and
all
the
time
i
could
command
i
spent
with
him
always
full
of
questionable
frolic
the
spirit
of
mischief
gathered
in
him
as
the
dark
nights
drew
on
the
sun
and
the
wind
and
the
green
fields
and
the
flowing
waters
of
summer
kept
him
within
bounds
but
when
the
ice
and
the
snow
came
when
the
sky
was
grey
with
one
cloud
when
the
wind
was
full
of
of
frost
and
the
ground
was
hard
as
a
stone
when
the
evenings
were
dark
and
the
sun
at
noon
shone
low
down
and
far
away
in
the
south
then
the
demon
of
mischief
awoke
in
the
bosom
of
peter
mason
and
this
winter
i
am
ashamed
to
say
drew
me
also
into
the
net
nothing
very
bad
was
the
result
before
the
incident
i
am
about
to
relate
there
must
have
been
however
a
gradual
declension
towards
it
although
the
pain
which
followed
upon
this
has
almost
obliterated
the
recollection
of
preceding
follies
nobody
does
anything
bad
all
at
once
wickedness
needs
an
apprenticeship
as
well
as
more
difficult
trades
it
was
in
january
not
long
after
the
shortest
day
the
sun
setting
about
three
o
clock
at
three
school
was
over
and
just
as
we
were
coming
out
peter
whispered
to
me
with
one
of
his
merriest
twinkles
in
his
eyes
come
across
after
dark
ranald
and
we
ll
have
some
i
promised
and
we
arranged
when
and
where
to
meet
it
was
friday
and
i
had
no
latin
to
prepare
for
saturday
therefore
my
father
did
not
want
me
i
remember
feeling
very
jolly
as
i
went
home
to
dinner
and
made
the
sun
set
ten
times
at
least
by
running
up
and
down
the
earthen
wall
which
parted
the
fields
from
the
road
for
as
often
as
i
ran
up
i
saw
him
again
over
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
behind
which
he
was
going
down
when
i
had
had
my
dinner
i
was
so
impatient
to
join
peter
mason
that
i
could
not
rest
and
from
very
idleness
began
to
tease
wee
davie
a
great
deal
of
that
nasty
teasing
so
common
among
boys
comes
of
idleness
poor
davie
began
to
cry
at
last
and
i
getting
more
and
more
wicked
went
on
teasing
him
until
at
length
he
burst
into
a
howl
of
wrath
and
misery
whereupon
the
kelpie
who
had
some
tenderness
for
him
burst
into
the
room
and
boxed
my
ears
soundly
i
was
in
a
fury
of
rage
and
revenge
and
had
i
been
near
anything
i
could
have
caught
up
something
serious
would
have
been
the
result
in
spite
of
my
resistance
she
pushed
me
out
of
the
room
and
locked
the
door
i
would
have
complained
to
my
father
but
i
was
perfectly
aware
that
although
had
no
right
to
strike
me
i
had
deserved
chastisement
for
my
behaviour
to
my
brother
i
was
still
boiling
with
anger
when
i
set
off
for
the
village
to
join
mason
i
mention
all
this
to
show
that
i
was
in
a
bad
state
of
mind
and
thus
prepared
for
the
wickedness
which
followed
i
repeat
a
boy
never
disgraces
himself
all
at
once
he
does
not
tumble
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
cellar
stair
he
goes
down
the
steps
himself
till
he
comes
to
the
broken
one
and
then
he
goes
to
the
bottom
with
a
rush
it
will
also
serve
to
show
that
the
enmity
between
mitchell
and
me
had
in
nowise
abated
and
that
however
excusable
she
might
be
in
the
case
just
mentioned
she
remained
an
evil
element
in
the
household
when
i
reached
the
village
i
found
very
few
people
about
the
night
was
very
cold
for
there
was
a
black
frost
there
had
been
a
thaw
the
day
before
which
had
carried
away
the
most
of
the
snow
but
in
the
corners
lay
remnants
of
dirty
heaps
which
had
been
swept
up
there
i
was
waiting
near
one
of
these
which
happened
to
be
at
the
spot
where
peter
had
arranged
to
meet
me
when
from
a
little
shop
near
a
girl
came
out
and
walked
quickly
down
the
street
i
yielded
to
the
temptation
arising
in
a
mind
which
had
grown
a
darkness
with
slimy
things
crawling
in
it
i
kicked
a
hole
in
the
frozen
crust
of
the
heap
scraped
out
a
handful
of
dirty
snow
kneaded
it
into
a
snowball
and
sent
it
after
the
girl
it
struck
her
on
the
back
of
the
head
she
gave
a
cry
and
ran
away
with
her
hand
to
her
forehead
brute
that
i
was
i
actually
laughed
i
think
i
must
have
been
nearer
the
devil
then
than
i
have
been
since
at
least
i
hope
so
for
you
see
it
was
not
with
me
as
with
boys
i
knew
quite
well
that
i
was
doing
wrong
and
refused
to
think
about
it
i
felt
bad
inside
peter
might
have
done
the
same
thing
without
being
half
as
wicked
as
i
was
he
did
not
feel
the
wickedness
of
that
kind
of
thing
as
i
did
he
would
have
laughed
over
it
merrily
but
the
vile
dregs
of
my
wrath
with
the
kelpie
were
fermenting
in
my
bosom
and
the
horrid
pleasure
i
found
in
annoying
an
innocent
girl
because
the
wicked
kelpie
had
made
me
angry
could
never
have
been
expressed
in
a
merry
laugh
like
mason
s
the
fact
is
i
was
more
displeased
with
myself
than
with
anybody
else
though
i
did
not
allow
it
and
would
not
take
the
trouble
to
repent
and
do
the
right
thing
if
i
had
even
said
to
wee
davie
that
i
was
sorry
i
do
not
think
i
should
have
done
the
other
wicked
things
that
followed
for
this
was
not
all
by
any
means
in
a
little
while
peter
joined
me
he
laughed
of
course
when
i
told
him
how
the
girl
had
run
like
a
frighted
hare
but
that
was
poor
fun
in
his
eyes
look
here
ranald
he
said
holding
out
something
like
a
piece
of
wood
what
is
it
peter
i
asked
it
s
the
stalk
of
a
cabbage
he
answered
i
ve
scooped
out
the
inside
and
filled
it
with
tow
we
ll
set
fire
to
one
end
and
blow
the
smoke
through
the
whose
keyhole
peter
an
old
witch
s
that
i
know
of
she
ll
be
in
such
a
rage
it
ll
be
fun
to
hear
her
cursing
and
swearing
we
d
serve
the
same
to
every
house
in
the
row
but
that
would
be
more
than
we
could
get
off
with
come
along
here
s
a
rope
to
tie
her
door
with
i
followed
him
not
without
inward
misgivings
which
i
kept
down
as
well
as
i
could
i
argued
with
myself
am
not
doing
it
i
am
only
going
with
peter
what
business
is
that
of
anybody
s
so
long
as
i
don
t
touch
the
thing
myself
only
a
few
minutes
more
and
i
was
helping
peter
to
tie
the
rope
to
the
of
a
poor
little
cottage
saying
now
to
myself
this
doesn
t
matter
this
won
t
do
her
any
harm
this
isn
t
smoke
and
after
all
smoke
won
t
hurt
the
nasty
old
thing
it
ll
only
make
her
angry
it
may
do
her
cough
good
i
dare
say
she
s
got
a
i
knew
all
i
was
saying
was
false
and
yet
i
acted
on
it
was
not
that
as
wicked
as
wickedness
could
be
one
moment
more
and
peter
was
blowing
through
the
hollow
cabbage
stalk
in
at
the
keyhole
with
all
his
might
catching
a
breath
of
the
stifling
smoke
himself
however
he
began
to
cough
violently
and
passed
the
wicked
instrument
to
me
i
put
my
mouth
to
it
and
blew
with
all
my
might
i
believe
now
that
there
was
some
far
more
objectionable
stuff
mingled
with
the
tow
in
a
few
moments
we
heard
the
old
woman
begin
to
cough
peter
who
was
peeping
in
at
the
window
whispered
she
s
rising
now
we
ll
catch
it
ranald
coughing
as
she
came
i
heard
her
with
shuffling
steps
approach
the
door
thinking
to
open
it
for
air
when
she
failed
in
opening
it
and
found
besides
where
the
smoke
was
coming
from
she
broke
into
a
torrent
of
fierce
and
vengeful
reproaches
mingled
with
epithets
by
no
means
flattering
she
did
not
curse
and
swear
as
peter
had
led
me
to
expect
although
her
language
was
certainly
far
enough
from
refined
but
therein
i
being
in
a
great
measure
the
guilty
cause
was
more
to
blame
than
she
i
laughed
because
i
would
not
be
unworthy
of
my
companion
who
was
genuinely
amused
but
i
was
in
reality
shocked
at
the
tempest
i
had
raised
i
stopped
blowing
aghast
at
what
i
had
done
but
peter
caught
the
tube
from
my
hand
and
recommenced
the
assault
with
fresh
vigour
whispering
through
the
keyhole
every
now
and
then
between
the
blasts
provoking
irritating
even
insulting
remarks
on
the
old
woman
s
personal
appearance
and
supposed
ways
of
living
this
threw
her
into
paroxysms
of
rage
and
of
coughing
both
increasing
in
violence
and
the
war
of
words
grew
she
tugging
at
the
door
as
she
screamed
he
answering
merrily
and
with
pretended
sympathy
for
her
sufferings
until
i
lost
all
remaining
delicacy
in
the
humour
of
the
wicked
game
and
laughed
loud
and
heartily
illustration
of
a
sudden
the
scolding
and
coughing
ceased
a
strange
sound
and
again
silence
followed
then
came
a
shrill
suppressed
scream
and
we
heard
the
voice
of
a
girl
crying
grannie
grannie
what
s
the
matter
with
you
can
t
you
speak
to
me
grannie
they
ve
smothered
my
grannie
sobs
and
moans
were
all
we
heard
now
peter
had
taken
fright
at
last
and
was
busy
undoing
the
rope
suddenly
he
flung
the
door
wide
and
fled
leaving
me
exposed
to
the
full
gaze
of
the
girl
to
my
horror
it
was
elsie
duff
she
was
just
approaching
the
door
her
eyes
streaming
with
tears
and
her
sweet
face
white
with
agony
i
stood
unable
to
move
or
speak
she
turned
away
without
a
word
and
began
again
to
busy
herself
with
the
old
woman
who
lay
on
the
ground
not
two
yards
from
the
door
i
heard
a
heavy
step
approaching
guilt
awoke
fear
and
restored
my
powers
of
motion
i
fled
at
full
speed
not
to
find
mason
but
to
leave
everything
behind
me
when
i
reached
the
manse
it
stood
alone
in
the
starry
blue
night
somehow
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
time
when
i
came
home
after
waking
up
in
the
barn
that
too
was
a
time
of
misery
but
oh
how
different
from
this
then
i
had
only
been
cruelly
treated
myself
now
i
had
actually
committed
cruelty
then
i
sought
my
father
s
bosom
as
the
one
refuge
now
i
dreaded
the
very
sight
of
my
father
for
i
could
not
look
him
in
the
face
he
was
my
father
but
i
was
not
his
son
a
hurried
glance
at
my
late
life
revealed
that
i
had
been
behaving
very
badly
growing
worse
and
worse
i
became
more
and
more
miserable
as
i
stood
but
what
to
do
i
could
not
tell
the
cold
at
length
drove
me
into
the
house
i
generally
sat
with
my
father
in
his
study
of
a
winter
night
now
but
i
dared
not
go
near
it
i
crept
to
the
nursery
where
i
found
a
bright
fire
burning
and
allister
reading
by
the
blaze
while
davie
lay
in
bed
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
i
sat
down
and
warmed
myself
but
the
warmth
could
not
reach
the
lump
of
ice
at
my
heart
i
sat
and
stared
at
the
fire
allister
was
too
much
occupied
with
his
book
to
take
any
heed
of
me
all
at
once
i
felt
a
pair
of
little
arms
about
my
neck
and
davie
was
trying
to
climb
upon
my
knees
instead
of
being
comforted
however
i
spoke
very
crossly
and
sent
him
back
to
his
bed
whimpering
you
see
i
was
only
miserable
i
was
not
repentant
i
was
eating
the
husks
with
the
swine
and
did
not
relish
them
but
i
had
not
said
i
will
arise
and
go
to
my
father
how
i
got
through
the
rest
of
that
evening
i
hardly
know
i
tried
to
read
but
could
not
i
was
rather
fond
of
arithmetic
so
i
got
my
slate
and
tried
to
work
a
sum
but
in
a
few
moments
i
was
sick
of
it
at
family
prayers
i
never
lifted
my
head
to
look
at
my
father
and
when
they
were
over
and
i
had
said
good
night
to
him
i
felt
that
i
was
sneaking
out
of
the
room
but
i
had
some
small
sense
of
protection
and
safety
when
once
in
bed
beside
little
davie
who
was
sound
asleep
and
looked
as
innocent
as
little
samuel
when
the
voice
of
god
was
going
to
call
him
i
put
my
arm
round
him
hugged
him
close
to
me
and
began
to
cry
and
the
crying
brought
me
sleep
it
was
a
very
long
time
now
since
i
had
dreamt
my
old
childish
dream
but
this
night
it
returned
the
old
sun
looked
down
upon
me
very
solemnly
there
was
no
smile
on
his
big
mouth
no
twinkle
about
the
corners
of
his
little
eyes
he
looked
at
mrs
moon
as
much
as
to
say
what
is
to
be
done
the
boy
has
been
going
the
wrong
way
must
we
disown
him
the
moon
neither
shook
her
head
nor
moved
her
lips
but
turned
as
on
a
pivot
and
stood
with
her
back
to
her
husband
looking
very
miserable
not
one
of
the
moved
from
its
place
they
shone
sickly
and
small
in
a
little
while
they
faded
out
then
the
moon
paled
and
paled
until
she
too
vanished
without
ever
turning
her
face
to
her
husband
and
last
the
sun
himself
began
to
change
only
instead
of
paling
he
drew
in
all
his
beams
and
shrunk
smaller
and
smaller
until
no
bigger
than
a
then
i
found
that
i
was
staring
at
a
candle
on
the
table
and
that
tom
was
kneeling
by
the
side
of
the
other
bed
saying
his
prayers
chapter
xvii
the
trouble
grows
when
i
woke
in
the
morning
i
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
i
had
made
a
great
deal
too
much
of
the
whole
business
that
if
not
a
dignified
thing
to
do
it
was
at
worst
but
a
boy
s
trick
only
i
would
have
no
more
to
say
to
peter
mason
who
had
betrayed
me
at
the
last
moment
without
even
the
temptation
of
any
benefit
to
himself
i
went
to
school
as
usual
it
was
the
day
for
the
shorter
catechism
none
failed
but
peter
and
me
and
we
two
were
kept
in
alone
and
left
in
the
schoolroom
together
i
seated
myself
as
far
from
him
as
i
could
in
half
an
hour
he
had
learned
his
task
while
i
had
not
mastered
the
half
of
mine
thereupon
he
proceeded
regardless
of
my
entreaties
to
prevent
me
learning
it
i
begged
and
prayed
and
appealed
to
his
pity
but
he
would
pull
the
book
away
from
me
gabble
bits
of
ballads
in
my
ear
as
i
was
struggling
with
tip
up
the
form
on
which
i
was
seated
and
in
short
annoy
me
in
twenty
different
ways
at
last
i
began
to
cry
for
mason
was
a
bigger
and
stronger
boy
than
i
and
i
could
not
help
myself
against
him
lifting
my
head
after
the
first
vexation
was
over
i
thought
i
saw
a
shadow
pass
from
the
window
although
i
could
not
positively
say
i
saw
it
i
had
a
conviction
it
was
turkey
and
my
heart
began
to
turn
again
towards
him
emboldened
by
the
fancied
proximity
i
attempted
my
lesson
once
more
but
that
moment
peter
was
down
upon
me
like
a
spider
at
last
however
growing
suddenly
weary
of
the
sport
he
desisted
and
said
ran
you
can
stay
if
you
like
i
ve
learned
my
catechism
and
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
wait
as
he
spoke
he
drew
a
picklock
from
his
pocket
his
father
was
an
ironmonger
deliberately
opened
the
schoolroom
door
slipped
out
and
locked
it
behind
him
then
he
came
to
one
of
the
windows
and
began
making
faces
at
me
but
vengeance
was
nigher
than
he
knew
a
deeper
shadow
darkened
my
page
and
when
i
looked
up
there
was
turkey
towering
over
mason
with
his
hand
on
his
collar
and
his
whip
lifted
the
whip
did
not
look
formidable
mason
received
the
threat
as
a
joke
and
laughed
in
turkey
s
face
perceiving
however
that
turkey
looked
dangerous
with
a
sudden
wriggle
at
which
he
was
an
adept
he
broke
free
and
trusting
to
his
tried
speed
of
foot
turned
his
head
and
made
a
grimace
as
he
took
to
his
heels
before
however
he
could
widen
the
space
between
them
sufficiently
turkey
s
whip
came
down
upon
him
with
a
howl
of
pain
peter
doubled
himself
up
and
turkey
fell
upon
him
and
heedless
of
his
yells
and
cries
pommelled
him
severely
although
they
were
now
at
some
distance
too
great
for
the
distinguishing
of
words
i
could
hear
that
turkey
mingled
admonition
with
punishment
a
little
longer
and
peter
crept
past
the
window
a
miserable
mass
of
collapsed
and
unstrung
impudence
his
face
bleared
with
crying
and
his
knuckles
dug
into
his
eyes
and
this
was
the
boy
i
had
chosen
for
my
leader
he
had
been
false
to
me
i
said
to
myself
and
the
noble
turkey
seeing
his
behaviour
through
the
window
had
watched
to
give
him
his
deserts
my
heart
was
full
of
gratitude
once
more
turkey
drew
near
the
window
what
was
my
dismay
and
indignation
to
hear
him
utter
the
following
words
if
you
weren
t
your
father
s
son
ranald
and
my
own
old
friend
i
would
serve
you
just
the
wrath
and
pride
arose
in
me
at
the
idea
of
turkey
who
used
to
call
himself
my
horse
behaving
to
me
after
this
fashion
and
my
evil
ways
having
half
made
a
sneak
of
me
i
cried
out
i
ll
tell
my
father
i
only
wish
you
would
and
then
i
should
be
no
if
he
asked
me
why
and
i
told
him
all
about
it
you
young
blackguard
you
re
no
gentleman
to
sneak
about
the
streets
and
hit
girls
with
snowballs
i
scorn
you
you
must
have
been
watching
then
turkey
and
you
had
no
business
to
do
that
i
said
plunging
at
any
defence
i
was
not
watching
you
but
if
i
had
been
it
would
have
been
just
as
right
as
watching
hawkie
you
creature
you
re
a
true
minister
s
it
s
a
mean
thing
to
do
turkey
i
persisted
seeking
to
stir
up
my
own
anger
and
blow
up
my
i
tell
you
i
did
not
do
it
i
met
elsie
duff
crying
in
the
street
because
you
had
hit
her
with
a
dirty
snowball
and
then
to
go
and
smoke
her
and
her
poor
grannie
till
the
old
woman
fell
down
in
a
faint
or
a
fit
i
don
t
know
which
you
deserve
a
good
pommelling
yourself
i
can
tell
you
ranald
i
m
ashamed
of
he
turned
to
go
away
turkey
turkey
i
cried
isn
t
the
old
woman
better
i
don
t
know
i
m
going
to
see
he
answered
come
back
and
tell
me
turkey
i
shouted
as
he
disappeared
from
the
field
of
my
vision
indeed
i
won
t
i
don
t
choose
to
keep
company
with
such
as
you
but
if
ever
i
hear
of
you
touching
them
again
you
shall
have
more
of
me
than
you
ll
like
and
you
may
tell
your
father
so
when
you
i
had
indeed
sunk
low
when
turkey
who
had
been
such
a
friend
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
more
in
a
few
minutes
the
master
returned
and
finding
me
crying
was
touched
with
compassion
he
sent
me
home
at
once
which
was
well
for
me
as
i
could
not
have
repeated
a
single
question
he
thought
peter
had
crept
through
one
of
the
panes
that
opened
for
ventilation
and
did
not
interrogate
me
about
his
disappearance
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
that
day
was
miserable
enough
i
even
hazarded
one
attempt
at
making
friends
with
mitchell
but
she
repelled
me
so
rudely
that
i
did
not
try
again
i
could
not
bear
the
company
of
either
allister
or
davie
i
would
have
gone
and
told
kirsty
but
i
said
to
myself
that
turkey
must
have
already
prejudiced
her
against
me
i
went
to
bed
the
moment
prayers
were
over
and
slept
a
troubled
sleep
i
dreamed
that
turkey
had
gone
and
told
my
father
and
that
he
had
turned
me
out
of
the
house
chapter
xviii
light
out
of
darkness
i
woke
early
on
the
sunday
morning
and
a
most
dreary
morning
it
was
i
could
not
lie
in
bed
and
although
no
one
was
up
yet
rose
and
dressed
myself
the
house
was
as
waste
as
a
sepulchre
i
opened
the
front
door
and
went
out
the
world
itself
was
no
better
the
day
had
hardly
begun
to
dawn
the
dark
dead
frost
held
it
in
chains
of
iron
the
sky
was
dull
and
leaden
and
cindery
flakes
of
snow
were
thinly
falling
everywhere
life
looked
utterly
dreary
and
hopeless
what
was
there
worth
living
for
i
went
out
on
the
road
and
the
ice
in
the
ruts
crackled
under
my
feet
like
the
bones
of
dead
things
i
wandered
away
from
the
house
and
the
keen
wind
cut
me
to
the
bone
for
i
had
not
put
on
plaid
or
cloak
i
turned
into
a
field
and
stumbled
along
over
its
uneven
surface
swollen
into
hard
frozen
lumps
so
that
it
was
like
walking
upon
stones
the
summer
was
gone
and
the
winter
was
here
and
my
heart
was
colder
and
more
miserable
than
any
winter
in
the
world
i
found
myself
at
length
at
the
hillock
where
turkey
and
i
had
lain
on
that
lovely
afternoon
the
year
before
the
stream
below
was
dumb
with
frost
the
wind
blew
wearily
but
sharply
across
the
bare
field
there
was
no
elsie
duff
with
head
drooping
over
her
knitting
seated
in
the
summer
grass
on
the
other
side
of
a
singing
brook
her
head
was
aching
on
her
pillow
because
i
had
struck
her
with
that
vile
lump
and
instead
of
the
odour
of
white
clover
she
was
breathing
the
dregs
of
the
hateful
smoke
with
which
i
had
filled
the
cottage
i
sat
down
cold
as
it
was
on
the
frozen
hillock
and
buried
my
face
in
my
hands
then
my
dream
returned
upon
me
this
was
how
i
sat
in
my
dream
when
my
father
had
turned
me
oh
how
dreadful
it
would
be
i
should
just
have
to
lie
down
and
die
i
could
not
sit
long
for
the
cold
mechanically
i
rose
and
paced
about
but
i
grew
so
wretched
in
body
that
it
made
me
forget
for
a
while
the
trouble
of
my
mind
and
i
wandered
home
again
the
house
was
just
stirring
i
crept
to
the
nursery
undressed
and
lay
down
beside
little
davie
who
cried
out
in
his
sleep
when
my
cold
feet
touched
him
but
i
did
not
sleep
again
although
i
lay
till
all
the
rest
had
gone
to
the
parlour
i
found
them
seated
round
a
blazing
fire
waiting
for
my
father
he
came
in
soon
after
and
we
had
our
breakfast
and
davie
gave
his
crumbs
as
usual
to
the
robins
and
sparrows
which
came
hopping
on
the
i
fancied
my
father
s
eyes
were
often
turned
in
my
direction
but
i
could
not
lift
mine
to
make
sure
i
had
never
before
known
what
misery
was
only
tom
and
i
went
to
church
that
day
it
was
so
cold
my
father
preached
from
the
text
be
sure
your
sin
shall
find
you
out
i
thought
with
myself
that
he
had
found
out
my
sin
and
was
preparing
to
punish
me
for
it
and
i
was
filled
with
terror
as
well
as
dismay
i
could
scarcely
keep
my
seat
so
wretched
was
i
but
when
after
many
instances
in
which
punishment
had
come
upon
when
they
least
expected
it
and
in
spite
of
every
precaution
to
fortify
themselves
against
it
he
proceeded
to
say
that
a
man
s
sin
might
find
him
out
long
before
the
punishment
of
it
overtook
him
and
drew
a
picture
of
the
misery
of
the
wicked
man
who
fled
when
none
pursued
him
and
trembled
at
the
rustling
of
a
leaf
then
i
was
certain
that
he
knew
what
i
had
done
or
had
seen
through
my
face
into
my
conscience
when
at
last
we
went
home
i
kept
waiting
the
whole
of
the
day
for
the
storm
to
break
expecting
every
moment
to
be
called
to
his
study
i
did
not
enjoy
a
mouthful
of
my
food
for
i
felt
his
eyes
upon
me
and
they
tortured
me
i
was
like
a
shy
creature
of
the
woods
whose
hole
had
been
stopped
up
i
had
no
place
of
refuge
nowhere
to
hide
my
head
and
i
felt
so
naked
my
very
soul
was
naked
after
tea
i
slunk
away
to
the
nursery
and
sat
staring
into
the
fire
mitchell
came
in
several
times
and
scolded
me
for
sitting
there
instead
of
with
tom
and
the
rest
in
the
parlour
but
i
was
too
miserable
even
to
answer
her
at
length
she
brought
davie
and
put
him
to
bed
and
a
few
minutes
after
i
heard
my
father
coming
down
the
stair
with
allister
who
was
chatting
away
to
him
i
wondered
how
he
could
my
father
came
in
with
the
big
bible
under
his
arm
as
was
his
custom
on
sunday
nights
drew
a
chair
to
the
table
rang
for
candles
and
with
allister
by
his
side
and
me
seated
opposite
to
him
began
to
find
a
place
from
which
to
read
to
us
to
my
yet
stronger
conviction
he
began
and
read
through
without
a
word
of
remark
the
parable
of
the
prodigal
son
when
he
came
to
the
father
s
delight
at
having
him
back
the
robe
and
the
shoes
and
the
ring
i
could
not
repress
my
tears
if
i
could
only
go
back
i
thought
and
set
it
all
right
but
then
i
ve
never
gone
it
was
a
foolish
thought
instantly
followed
by
a
longing
impulse
to
tell
my
father
all
about
it
how
could
it
be
that
i
had
not
thought
of
this
before
i
had
been
waiting
all
this
time
for
my
sin
to
find
me
out
why
should
i
not
frustrate
my
sin
and
find
my
father
first
as
soon
as
he
had
done
reading
and
before
he
had
opened
his
mouth
to
make
any
remark
i
crept
round
the
table
to
his
side
and
whispered
in
his
ear
papa
i
want
to
speak
to
very
well
ranald
he
said
more
solemnly
i
thought
than
usual
come
up
to
the
illustration
he
rose
and
led
the
way
and
i
followed
a
whimper
of
disappointment
came
from
davie
s
bed
my
father
went
and
kissed
him
and
said
he
would
soon
be
back
whereupon
davie
nestled
down
satisfied
when
we
reached
the
study
he
closed
the
door
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
drew
me
towards
him
i
burst
out
crying
and
could
not
speak
for
sobs
he
encouraged
me
most
kindly
he
said
have
you
been
doing
anything
wrong
my
boy
yes
papa
very
wrong
i
sobbed
i
m
disgusted
with
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
my
dear
he
returned
there
is
some
hope
of
you
oh
i
don
t
know
that
i
rejoined
even
turkey
despises
that
s
very
serious
said
my
father
he
s
a
fine
fellow
turkey
i
should
not
like
him
to
despise
me
but
tell
me
all
about
it
was
with
great
difficulty
i
could
begin
but
with
the
help
of
questioning
me
my
father
at
length
understood
the
whole
matter
he
paused
for
a
while
plunged
in
thought
then
rose
saying
it
s
a
serious
affair
my
dear
boy
but
now
you
have
told
me
i
shall
be
able
to
help
but
you
knew
about
it
before
didn
t
you
papa
surely
you
did
not
a
word
of
it
ranald
you
fancied
so
because
your
sin
had
found
you
out
i
must
go
and
see
how
the
poor
woman
is
i
don
t
want
to
reproach
you
at
all
now
you
are
sorry
but
i
should
like
you
just
to
think
that
you
have
been
helping
to
make
that
poor
old
woman
wicked
she
is
naturally
of
a
sour
disposition
and
you
have
made
it
sourer
still
and
no
doubt
made
her
hate
everybody
more
than
she
was
already
inclined
to
do
you
have
been
working
against
god
in
this
i
burst
into
fresh
tears
it
was
too
dreadful
what
i
to
do
i
cried
of
course
you
must
beg
gregson
s
pardon
and
tell
her
that
you
are
both
sorry
and
yes
yes
papa
do
let
me
go
with
it
s
too
late
to
find
her
up
i
m
afraid
but
we
can
just
go
and
see
we
ve
done
a
wrong
a
very
grievous
wrong
my
boy
and
i
can
not
rest
till
i
at
least
know
the
consequences
of
he
put
on
his
long
greatcoat
and
muffler
in
haste
and
having
seen
that
i
too
was
properly
wrapped
up
he
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
but
remembering
the
promise
he
had
made
to
davie
he
turned
and
went
down
to
the
nursery
to
speak
to
him
again
while
i
awaited
him
on
the
doorsteps
it
would
have
been
quite
dark
but
for
the
stars
and
there
was
no
snow
to
give
back
any
of
their
shine
the
earth
swallowed
all
their
rays
and
was
no
brighter
for
it
but
oh
what
a
change
to
me
from
the
frightful
morning
when
my
father
returned
i
put
my
hand
in
his
almost
as
fearlessly
as
allister
or
wee
davie
might
have
done
and
away
we
walked
together
papa
i
said
why
did
you
say
have
done
a
wrong
you
did
not
do
my
dear
boy
persons
who
are
so
near
each
other
as
we
are
must
not
only
bear
the
consequences
together
of
any
wrong
done
by
one
of
them
but
must
in
a
sense
bear
each
other
s
iniquities
even
if
i
sin
you
must
suffer
if
you
sin
you
being
my
own
boy
i
must
suffer
but
this
is
not
all
it
lies
upon
both
of
us
to
do
what
we
can
to
get
rid
of
the
wrong
done
and
thus
we
have
to
bear
each
other
s
sin
i
am
accountable
to
make
amends
as
far
as
i
can
and
also
to
do
what
i
can
to
get
you
to
be
sorry
and
make
amends
as
far
as
you
but
papa
isn
t
that
hard
i
asked
do
you
think
i
should
like
to
leave
you
to
get
out
of
your
sin
as
you
best
could
or
sink
deeper
and
deeper
into
it
should
i
grudge
anything
to
take
the
weight
of
the
sin
or
the
wrong
to
others
off
you
do
you
think
i
should
want
not
to
be
troubled
about
it
or
if
i
were
to
do
anything
wrong
would
you
think
it
very
hard
that
you
had
to
help
me
to
be
good
and
set
things
right
even
if
people
looked
down
upon
you
because
of
me
would
you
say
it
was
hard
would
you
not
rather
say
i
m
glad
to
bear
anything
for
my
father
i
ll
share
with
him
yes
indeed
papa
i
would
rather
share
with
you
than
not
whatever
it
then
you
see
my
boy
how
kind
god
is
in
tying
us
up
in
one
bundle
that
way
it
is
a
grand
and
beautiful
thing
that
the
fathers
should
suffer
for
the
children
and
the
children
for
the
fathers
come
along
we
must
step
out
or
i
fear
we
shall
not
be
able
to
make
our
apology
when
we
ve
got
over
this
ranald
we
must
be
a
good
deal
more
careful
what
company
we
oh
papa
i
answered
if
turkey
would
only
forgive
me
there
s
no
fear
turkey
is
sure
to
forgive
you
when
you
ve
done
what
you
can
to
make
amends
he
s
a
fine
fellow
turkey
i
have
a
high
opinion
of
turkey
as
you
call
if
he
would
papa
i
should
not
wish
for
any
other
company
than
a
boy
wants
various
kinds
of
companions
ranald
but
i
fear
you
have
been
neglecting
turkey
you
owe
him
yes
indeed
i
do
papa
i
answered
and
i
have
been
neglecting
him
if
i
had
kept
with
turkey
i
should
never
have
got
into
such
a
dreadful
scrape
as
that
is
too
light
a
word
to
use
for
it
my
boy
don
t
call
a
wickedness
a
scrape
for
a
wickedness
it
certainly
was
though
i
am
only
too
willing
to
believe
you
had
no
adequate
idea
at
the
time
wicked
it
i
won
t
again
papa
but
i
am
so
relieved
perhaps
poor
old
gregson
is
not
relieved
though
you
ought
not
to
forget
thus
talking
we
hurried
on
until
we
arrived
at
the
cottage
a
dim
light
was
visible
through
the
window
my
father
knocked
and
elsie
duff
opened
the
door
chapter
xix
forgiveness
when
we
entered
there
sat
the
old
woman
on
the
farther
side
of
the
hearth
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
i
hardly
dared
look
up
elsie
s
face
was
composed
and
sweet
she
gave
me
a
shy
tremulous
smile
which
went
to
my
heart
and
humbled
me
dreadfully
my
father
took
the
stool
on
which
elsie
had
been
sitting
when
he
had
lowered
himself
upon
it
his
face
was
nearly
on
a
level
with
that
of
the
old
woman
who
took
no
notice
of
him
but
kept
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
and
moaning
he
laid
his
hand
on
hers
which
old
and
withered
and
not
very
clean
lay
on
her
knee
how
do
you
find
yourself
gregson
he
asked
i
m
an
woman
she
replied
with
a
groan
behaving
as
if
it
was
my
father
who
had
maltreated
her
and
whose
duty
it
was
to
make
an
apology
for
it
i
am
aware
of
what
you
mean
gregson
that
is
what
brought
me
to
inquire
after
you
i
hope
you
are
not
seriously
the
worse
for
i
m
an
woman
she
repeated
every
man
s
hand
s
against
well
i
hardly
think
that
said
my
father
in
a
cheerful
tone
hand
s
not
against
you
if
you
bring
up
your
sons
bannerman
to
mock
at
the
poor
and
find
their
amusement
in
driving
the
aged
and
infirm
to
death
s
door
you
can
t
say
your
hand
s
not
against
a
poor
lone
woman
like
but
i
don
t
bring
up
my
sons
to
do
so
if
i
did
i
shouldn
t
be
here
now
i
am
willing
to
bear
my
part
of
the
blame
gregson
but
to
say
i
bring
my
sons
up
to
that
kind
of
wickedness
is
to
lay
on
me
more
than
my
share
a
good
come
here
i
obeyed
with
bowed
head
and
heart
for
i
saw
what
wrong
i
had
done
my
father
and
that
although
few
would
be
so
unjust
to
him
as
this
old
woman
many
would
yet
blame
the
best
man
in
the
world
for
the
wrongs
of
his
children
when
i
stood
by
my
father
s
side
the
old
woman
just
lifted
her
head
once
to
cast
on
me
a
scowling
look
and
then
went
on
again
rocking
herself
now
my
boy
said
my
father
tell
gregson
why
you
have
come
here
i
had
to
use
a
dreadful
effort
to
make
myself
speak
it
was
like
resisting
a
dumb
spirit
and
forcing
the
words
from
my
lips
but
i
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
in
fact
i
dared
not
hesitate
for
i
felt
that
hesitation
would
be
defeat
i
came
papa
i
began
no
no
my
man
said
my
father
you
must
speak
to
gregson
not
to
thereupon
i
had
to
make
a
fresh
effort
when
at
this
day
i
see
a
child
who
will
not
say
the
words
required
of
him
i
feel
again
just
as
i
felt
then
and
think
how
difficult
it
is
for
him
to
do
what
he
is
told
but
oh
how
i
wish
he
would
do
it
that
he
might
be
a
conqueror
i
for
i
know
that
if
he
will
not
make
the
effort
it
will
grow
more
and
more
difficult
for
him
to
make
any
effort
i
can
not
be
too
thankful
that
i
was
able
to
overcome
now
i
came
gregson
i
faltered
to
tell
you
that
i
am
very
sorry
i
behaved
so
ill
to
yes
indeed
she
returned
how
would
you
like
anyone
to
come
and
serve
you
so
in
your
grand
house
but
a
poor
lone
widow
woman
like
me
is
nothing
to
be
thought
of
oh
no
not
at
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
i
said
almost
forcing
my
confession
upon
her
so
you
ought
to
be
all
the
days
of
your
life
you
deserve
to
be
drummed
out
of
the
town
for
a
minister
s
son
that
you
are
hoo
i
ll
never
do
it
again
you
d
better
not
or
you
shall
hear
of
it
if
there
s
a
sheriff
in
the
county
to
insult
honest
people
after
that
fashion
i
drew
back
more
than
ever
conscious
of
the
wrong
i
had
done
in
rousing
such
unforgiving
fierceness
in
the
heart
of
a
woman
my
father
spoke
now
shall
i
tell
you
gregson
what
made
the
boy
sorry
and
made
him
willing
to
come
and
tell
you
all
about
it
oh
i
ve
got
friends
after
all
the
young
prodigal
you
are
coming
pretty
near
it
gregson
said
my
father
but
you
haven
t
touched
it
quite
it
was
a
friend
of
yours
that
spoke
to
my
boy
and
made
him
very
unhappy
about
what
he
had
done
telling
him
over
and
over
again
what
a
shame
it
was
and
how
wicked
of
him
do
you
know
what
friend
it
was
perhaps
i
do
and
perhaps
i
don
t
i
can
i
fear
you
don
t
guess
quite
correctly
it
was
the
best
friend
you
ever
had
or
ever
will
have
it
was
god
himself
talking
in
my
poor
boy
s
heart
he
would
not
heed
what
he
said
all
day
but
in
the
evening
we
were
reading
how
the
prodigal
son
went
back
to
his
father
and
how
the
father
forgave
him
and
he
couldn
t
stand
it
any
longer
and
came
and
told
me
all
about
it
wasn
t
you
he
had
to
go
to
it
wasn
t
you
he
smoked
to
death
was
it
now
it
was
easy
enough
to
go
to
not
so
easy
perhaps
but
he
has
come
to
you
come
when
you
made
him
i
didn
t
make
him
he
came
gladly
he
saw
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
make
up
for
the
wrong
he
had
a
poor
amends
i
heard
her
grumble
but
my
father
took
no
notice
and
you
know
gregson
he
went
on
when
the
prodigal
son
did
go
back
to
his
father
his
father
forgave
him
at
easy
enough
he
was
his
father
and
fathers
always
side
with
their
i
saw
my
father
thinking
for
a
moment
yes
that
is
true
he
said
and
what
he
does
himself
he
always
wants
his
sons
and
daughters
to
do
so
he
tells
us
that
if
we
don
t
forgive
one
another
he
will
not
forgive
us
and
as
we
all
want
to
be
forgiven
we
had
better
mind
what
we
re
told
if
you
don
t
forgive
this
boy
who
has
done
you
a
great
wrong
but
is
sorry
for
it
god
will
not
forgive
you
and
that
s
a
serious
he
s
never
begged
my
pardon
yet
said
the
old
woman
whose
dignity
required
the
utter
humiliation
of
the
offender
i
beg
your
pardon
gregson
i
said
i
shall
never
be
rude
to
you
very
well
she
answered
a
little
mollified
at
last
keep
your
promise
and
we
ll
say
no
more
about
it
it
s
for
your
father
s
sake
mind
that
i
forgive
i
saw
a
smile
trembling
about
my
father
s
lips
but
he
suppressed
it
saying
won
t
you
shake
hands
with
him
gregson
she
held
out
a
poor
shrivelled
hand
which
i
took
very
gladly
but
it
felt
so
strange
in
mine
that
i
was
frightened
at
it
it
was
like
something
half
dead
but
at
the
same
moment
from
behind
me
another
hand
a
rough
little
hand
but
warm
and
firm
and
all
alive
slipped
into
my
left
hand
i
knew
it
was
elsie
duff
s
and
the
thought
of
how
i
had
behaved
to
her
rushed
in
upon
me
with
a
cold
misery
of
shame
i
would
have
knelt
at
her
feet
but
i
could
not
speak
my
sorrow
before
witnesses
therefore
i
kept
hold
of
her
hand
and
led
her
by
it
to
the
other
end
of
the
cottage
for
there
was
a
friendly
gloom
the
only
light
in
the
place
coming
from
the
glow
not
flame
of
a
fire
of
peat
and
bark
she
came
readily
whispering
before
i
had
time
to
open
my
mouth
i
m
sorry
grannie
s
so
hard
to
make
it
i
deserve
it
i
said
elsie
i
m
a
brute
i
could
knock
my
head
on
the
wall
please
forgive
it
s
not
me
she
answered
you
didn
t
hurt
me
i
didn
t
mind
oh
elsie
i
struck
you
with
that
horrid
it
was
only
on
the
back
of
my
neck
it
didn
t
hurt
me
much
it
only
frightened
i
didn
t
know
it
was
you
if
i
had
known
i
am
sure
i
shouldn
t
have
done
it
but
it
was
wicked
and
contemptible
anyhow
to
any
i
broke
down
again
half
from
shame
half
from
the
happiness
of
having
cast
my
sin
from
me
by
confessing
it
elsie
held
my
hand
now
never
mind
never
mind
she
said
you
won
t
do
it
i
would
rather
be
hanged
i
sobbed
that
moment
a
pair
of
strong
hands
caught
hold
of
mine
and
the
next
i
found
myself
being
hoisted
on
somebody
s
back
by
a
succession
of
heaves
and
pitches
which
did
not
cease
until
i
was
firmly
seated
then
a
voice
said
i
m
his
horse
again
elsie
and
i
ll
carry
him
home
this
very
elsie
gave
a
pleased
little
laugh
and
turkey
bore
me
to
the
fireside
where
my
father
was
talking
away
in
a
low
tone
to
the
old
woman
i
believe
he
had
now
turned
the
tables
upon
her
and
was
trying
to
convince
her
of
her
unkind
and
grumbling
ways
but
he
did
not
let
us
hear
a
word
of
the
reproof
eh
turkey
my
lad
is
that
you
i
didn
t
know
you
were
there
he
said
i
had
never
before
heard
my
father
address
him
as
turkey
what
are
you
doing
with
that
great
boy
upon
your
back
he
continued
i
m
going
to
carry
him
home
nonsense
he
can
walk
well
half
ashamed
i
began
to
struggle
to
get
down
but
turkey
held
me
tight
but
you
see
sir
said
turkey
we
re
friends
now
done
what
he
could
and
want
to
do
what
i
very
well
returned
my
father
rising
come
along
it
s
time
we
were
when
he
bade
her
good
night
the
old
woman
actually
rose
and
held
out
her
hand
to
both
of
us
good
night
grannie
said
turkey
good
night
and
away
we
went
never
conqueror
on
his
triumphal
entry
was
happier
than
i
as
through
the
starry
night
i
rode
home
on
turkey
s
back
the
very
stars
seemed
rejoicing
over
my
head
when
i
think
of
it
now
the
words
always
come
with
it
there
is
joy
in
the
presence
of
the
angels
of
god
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
and
i
can
not
but
believe
they
rejoiced
then
for
if
ever
i
repented
in
my
life
i
repented
then
when
at
length
i
was
down
in
bed
beside
davie
it
seemed
as
if
there
could
be
nobody
in
the
world
so
blessed
as
i
was
i
had
been
forgiven
when
i
woke
in
the
morning
i
was
as
it
were
new
born
into
a
new
world
before
getting
up
i
had
a
rare
game
with
davie
whose
shrieks
of
laughter
at
length
brought
mitchell
with
angry
face
but
i
found
myself
kindly
disposed
even
towards
her
the
weather
was
much
the
same
but
its
dreariness
had
vanished
there
was
a
glowing
spot
in
my
heart
which
drove
out
the
cold
and
glorified
the
black
frost
that
bound
the
earth
when
i
went
out
before
breakfast
and
saw
the
red
face
of
the
sun
looking
through
the
mist
like
a
bright
copper
kettle
he
seemed
to
know
all
about
it
and
to
be
friends
with
me
as
he
had
never
been
before
and
i
was
quite
as
well
satisfied
as
if
the
sun
of
my
dream
had
given
me
a
friendly
nod
of
forgiveness

i
have
a
fall
and
a
dream
elsie
duff
s
father
was
a
with
a
large
family
he
was
what
is
called
a
cottar
in
scotland
which
name
implies
that
of
the
large
farm
upon
which
he
worked
for
yearly
wages
he
had
a
little
bit
of
land
to
cultivate
for
his
own
use
his
wife
s
mother
was
grannie
gregson
she
was
so
old
that
she
needed
someone
to
look
after
her
but
she
had
a
cottage
of
her
own
in
the
village
and
would
not
go
and
live
with
her
daughter
and
indeed
they
were
not
anxious
to
have
her
for
she
was
not
by
any
means
a
pleasant
person
so
there
was
no
help
for
it
elsie
must
go
and
be
her
companion
it
was
a
great
trial
to
her
at
first
for
her
home
was
a
happy
one
her
mother
being
very
unlike
her
grandmother
and
besides
she
greatly
preferred
the
open
fields
to
the
streets
of
the
village
she
did
not
grumble
however
for
where
is
the
good
of
grumbling
where
duty
is
plain
or
even
when
a
thing
can
not
be
helped
she
found
it
very
lonely
though
especially
when
her
grannie
was
in
one
of
her
gloomy
moods
then
she
would
not
answer
a
question
but
leave
the
poor
girl
to
do
what
she
thought
best
and
complain
of
it
afterwards
this
was
partly
the
reason
why
her
parents
towards
the
close
of
the
spring
sent
a
little
brother
who
was
too
delicate
to
be
of
much
use
at
home
to
spend
some
months
with
his
grannie
and
go
to
school
the
intention
had
been
that
elsie
herself
should
go
to
school
but
what
with
the
cow
and
her
grandmother
together
she
had
not
been
able
to
begin
of
course
grannie
grumbled
at
the
proposal
but
as
turkey
my
informant
on
these
points
explained
she
was
afraid
lest
if
she
objected
they
should
take
elsie
away
and
send
a
younger
sister
in
her
place
so
little
jamie
duff
came
to
the
school
he
was
a
poor
little
boy
who
found
himself
very
much
out
of
his
element
there
some
of
the
bigger
boys
imagined
it
good
fun
to
tease
him
but
on
the
whole
he
was
rather
a
favourite
for
he
looked
so
pitiful
and
took
everything
so
patiently
for
my
part
i
was
delighted
at
the
chance
of
showing
elsie
duff
some
kindness
through
her
brother
the
girl
s
sweetness
clung
to
me
and
not
only
rendered
it
impossible
for
me
to
be
rude
to
any
girl
but
kept
me
awake
to
the
occurrence
of
any
opportunity
of
doing
something
for
her
sake
perceiving
one
day
before
the
master
arrived
that
jamie
was
shivering
with
cold
i
made
way
for
him
where
i
stood
by
the
fire
and
then
found
that
he
had
next
to
nothing
upon
his
little
body
and
that
the
soles
of
his
shoes
were
hanging
half
off
this
in
the
month
of
march
in
the
north
of
scotland
was
bad
enough
even
if
he
had
not
had
a
cough
i
told
my
father
when
i
went
home
and
he
sent
me
to
tell
mitchell
to
look
out
some
old
garments
of
allister
s
for
him
but
she
declared
there
were
none
when
i
told
turkey
this
he
looked
very
grave
but
said
nothing
when
i
told
my
father
he
desired
me
to
take
the
boy
to
the
tailor
and
shoemaker
and
get
warm
and
strong
clothes
and
shoes
made
for
him
i
was
proud
enough
of
the
commission
and
if
i
did
act
the
grand
benefactor
a
little
i
have
not
yet
finished
the
penance
of
it
for
it
never
comes
into
my
mind
without
bringing
its
shame
with
it
of
how
many
people
shall
i
not
have
to
beg
the
precious
forgiveness
when
i
meet
them
in
the
other
world
for
the
sake
of
this
penal
shame
i
confess
i
let
the
little
fellow
walk
behind
me
as
i
took
him
through
the
streets
perhaps
i
may
say
this
for
myself
that
i
never
thought
of
demanding
any
service
of
him
in
return
for
mine
i
was
not
so
bad
as
that
and
i
was
true
in
heart
to
him
notwithstanding
my
pride
for
i
had
a
real
affection
for
him
i
had
not
seen
his
sister
to
speak
to
i
mean
since
that
sunday
night
one
saturday
afternoon
as
we
were
having
a
game
something
like
hare
and
hounds
i
was
running
very
hard
through
the
village
when
i
set
my
foot
on
a
loose
stone
and
had
a
violent
fall
when
i
got
up
i
saw
jamie
duff
standing
by
my
side
with
a
face
of
utter
consternation
i
discovered
afterwards
that
he
was
in
the
way
of
following
me
about
finding
the
blood
streaming
down
my
face
and
remarking
when
i
came
to
myself
a
little
that
i
was
very
near
the
house
where
turkey
s
mother
lived
i
crawled
thither
and
up
the
stairs
to
her
garret
jamie
following
in
silence
i
found
her
busy
as
usual
at
her
wheel
and
elsie
duff
stood
talking
to
her
as
if
she
had
just
run
in
for
a
moment
and
must
not
sit
down
elsie
gave
a
little
cry
when
she
saw
the
state
i
was
in
and
turkey
s
mother
got
up
and
made
me
take
her
chair
while
she
hastened
to
get
some
water
i
grew
faint
and
lost
my
consciousness
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
leaning
against
elsie
whose
face
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
with
dismay
i
took
a
little
water
and
soon
began
to
revive
when
turkey
s
mother
had
tied
up
my
head
i
rose
to
go
home
but
she
persuaded
me
to
lie
down
a
while
i
was
not
unwilling
to
comply
what
a
sense
of
blissful
repose
pervaded
me
weary
with
running
and
perhaps
faint
with
loss
of
blood
when
i
stretched
myself
on
the
bed
whose
patchwork
counterpane
let
me
say
for
turkey
s
mother
was
as
clean
as
any
down
quilt
in
chambers
of
the
rich
i
remember
so
well
how
a
single
ray
of
sunlight
fell
on
the
floor
from
the
little
window
in
the
roof
just
on
the
foot
that
kept
turning
the
its
hum
sounded
sleepy
in
my
ears
i
gazed
at
the
sloping
ray
of
light
in
which
the
ceaseless
rotation
of
the
swift
wheel
kept
the
motes
dancing
most
busily
until
at
length
to
my
eyes
it
became
a
huge
jacob
s
ladder
crowded
with
an
innumerable
company
of
ascending
and
descending
angels
and
i
thought
it
must
be
the
same
ladder
i
used
to
see
in
my
dream
the
drowsy
delight
which
follows
on
the
loss
of
blood
possessed
me
and
the
little
garret
with
the
slanting
roof
and
its
sloping
and
the
whirr
of
the
wheel
and
the
form
of
the
patient
woman
that
span
had
begun
to
gather
about
them
the
hues
of
paradise
to
my
slowly
fading
senses
when
i
heard
a
voice
that
sounded
miles
away
and
yet
close
to
my
ear
elsie
sing
a
little
song
will
you
i
heard
no
reply
a
pause
followed
and
then
a
voice
clear
and
melodious
as
a
brook
began
to
sing
and
before
it
ceased
i
was
indeed
in
a
kind
of
paradise
illustration
but
here
i
must
pause
shall
i
be
breaking
my
promise
of
not
a
word
of
scotch
in
my
story
if
i
give
the
song
true
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
story
exactly
but
it
is
in
it
if
my
reader
would
like
the
song
he
must
have
it
in
scotch
or
not
at
all
i
am
not
going
to
spoil
it
by
turning
it
out
of
its
own
natural
clothes
into
finer
garments
to
which
it
was
not
born
i
mean
by
translating
it
from
scotch
into
english
the

will
be

slippery

in

gave

full
of
tunes
i
repeated
them
to
my
father
once
and
he
was
greatly
pleased
with
them
on
this
first
acquaintance
however
they
put
me
to
sleep
and
little
jamie
duff
was
sent
over
to
tell
my
father
what
had
happened
jamie
gave
the
message
to
mitchell
and
she
full
of
her
own
importance
must
needs
set
out
to
see
how
much
was
the
matter
i
was
dreaming
an
unutterably
delicious
dream
it
was
a
summer
evening
the
sun
was
of
a
tremendous
size
and
of
a
splendid
he
was
resting
with
his
lower
edge
on
the
horizon
and
dared
go
no
farther
because
all
the
flowers
would
sing
instead
of
giving
out
their
proper
scents
and
if
he
left
them
he
feared
utter
anarchy
in
his
kingdom
before
he
got
back
in
the
morning
i
woke
and
saw
the
ugly
face
of
mitchell
bending
over
me
she
was
pushing
me
and
calling
to
me
to
wake
up
the
moment
i
saw
her
i
shut
my
eyes
tight
turned
away
and
pretended
to
be
fast
asleep
again
in
the
hope
that
she
would
go
away
and
leave
me
with
my
friends
do
let
him
have
his
sleep
out
mitchell
said
turkey
s
mother
you
ve
let
him
sleep
too
long
already
she
returned
ungraciously
he
ll
do
all
he
can
waking
or
sleeping
to
make
himself
troublesome
he
s
a
ne
ranald
little
good
ll
ever
come
of
him
it
s
a
mercy
his
mother
is
under
the
mould
for
he
would
have
broken
her
i
had
come
to
myself
quite
by
this
time
but
i
was
not
in
the
least
more
inclined
to
acknowledge
it
to
mitchell
you
re
wrong
there
mitchell
said
elsie
duff
and
my
reader
must
remember
it
required
a
good
deal
of
courage
to
stand
up
against
a
woman
so
much
older
than
herself
and
occupying
the
important
position
of
housekeeper
to
the
minister
ranald
is
a
good
boy
i
m
sure
he
how
dare
you
say
so
when
he
served
your
poor
old
grandmother
such
a
wicked
trick
it
s
little
the
children
care
for
their
parents
nowadays
don
t
speak
to
no
don
t
elsie
said
another
voice
accompanied
by
a
creaking
of
the
door
and
a
heavy
step
don
t
speak
to
her
elsie
or
you
ll
have
the
worst
of
it
leave
her
to
if
ranald
did
what
you
say
mitchell
and
i
don
t
deny
it
he
was
at
least
very
sorry
for
it
afterwards
and
begged
grannie
s
pardon
and
that
s
a
sort
of
thing
never
did
in
your
i
never
had
any
occasion
turkey
so
you
hold
your
now
don
t
you
call
me
i
won
t
stand
it
i
was
christened
as
well
as
and
what
are
to
speak
to
me
like
that
go
home
to
your
cows
i
dare
say
they
re
standing
supperless
in
their
stalls
while
you
re
gadding
about
i
ll
call
you
as
long
as
i
very
well
kelpie
that
s
the
name
you
re
known
by
though
perhaps
no
one
has
been
polite
enough
to
use
it
to
your
face
for
you
re
a
great
woman
no
doubt
i
give
you
warning
that
i
know
you
when
you
re
found
out
don
t
say
i
didn
t
give
you
a
chance
you
impudent
beggar
cried
mitchell
in
a
rage
and
you
re
all
one
pack
she
added
looking
round
on
the
two
others
get
up
ranald
and
come
home
with
me
directly
what
are
you
lying
shamming
there
for
as
she
spoke
she
approached
the
bed
but
turkey
was
too
quick
for
her
and
got
in
front
of
it
as
he
was
now
a
great
strong
lad
she
dared
not
lay
hands
upon
him
so
she
turned
in
a
rage
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
saying
mr
bannerman
shall
hear
of
then
it
ll
be
both
sides
of
it
mitchell
i
cried
from
the
bed
but
she
vanished
vouchsafing
me
no
reply
once
more
turkey
got
me
on
his
back
and
carried
me
home
i
told
my
father
the
whole
occurrence
he
examined
the
cut
and
plastered
it
up
for
me
saying
he
would
go
and
thank
turkey
s
mother
at
once
i
confess
i
thought
more
of
elsie
duff
and
her
wonderful
singing
which
had
put
me
to
sleep
and
given
me
the
strange
lovely
dream
from
which
the
rough
hands
and
harsh
voice
of
the
kelpie
had
waked
me
too
soon
after
this
although
i
never
dared
go
near
her
grandmother
s
house
alone
i
yet
by
loitering
and
watching
got
many
a
peep
of
elsie
sometimes
i
went
with
turkey
to
his
mother
s
of
an
evening
to
which
my
father
had
no
objection
and
somehow
or
other
elsie
was
sure
to
be
there
and
we
spent
a
very
happy
hour
or
two
together
sometimes
she
would
sing
and
sometimes
i
would
read
to
them
out
of
milton
i
read
the
whole
of
comus
to
them
by
degrees
in
this
way
and
although
there
was
much
i
could
not
at
all
understand
i
am
perfectly
certain
it
had
an
ennobling
effect
upon
every
one
of
us
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
intellect
should
define
and
separate
before
the
heart
and
soul
derive
nourishment
as
well
say
that
a
bee
can
get
nothing
out
of
a
flower
because
she
does
not
understand
botany
the
very
music
of
the
stately
words
of
such
a
poem
is
enough
to
generate
a
better
mood
to
make
one
feel
the
air
of
higher
regions
and
wish
to
rise
above
the
smoke
and
stir
of
this
dim
spot
the
best
influences
which
bear
upon
us
are
of
this
vague
sort
powerful
upon
the
heart
and
conscience
although
undefined
to
the
intellect
but
i
find
i
have
been
forgetting
that
those
for
whom
i
write
are
young
too
young
to
understand
this
let
it
remain
however
for
those
older
persons
who
at
an
odd
moment
while
waiting
for
dinner
or
before
going
to
bed
may
take
up
a
little
one
s
book
and
turn
over
a
few
of
its
leaves
some
such
readers
in
virtue
of
their
hearts
being
young
and
old
both
at
once
discern
more
in
the
children
s
books
than
the
children
themselves
chapter
xxi
the
bees
nest
it
was
twelve
o
clock
on
a
delicious
saturday
in
the
height
of
summer
we
poured
out
of
school
with
the
gladness
of
a
holiday
in
our
hearts
i
sauntered
home
full
of
the
summer
sun
and
the
summer
wind
and
the
summer
scents
which
filled
the
air
i
do
not
know
how
often
i
sat
down
in
perfect
bliss
upon
the
earthen
walls
which
divided
the
fields
from
the
road
and
basked
in
the
heat
these
walls
were
covered
with
grass
and
moss
the
odour
of
a
certain
yellow
feathery
flower
which
grew
on
them
rather
plentifully
used
to
give
me
special
delight
great
haunted
the
walls
and
were
poking
about
in
them
constantly
butterflies
also
found
them
pleasant
places
and
i
delighted
in
butterflies
though
i
seldom
succeeded
in
catching
one
i
do
not
remember
that
i
ever
killed
one
heart
and
conscience
both
were
against
that
i
had
got
the
loan
of
trimmer
s
story
of
the
family
of
robins
and
was
every
now
and
then
reading
a
page
of
it
with
unspeakable
delight
we
had
very
few
books
for
children
in
those
days
and
in
that
far
place
and
those
we
did
get
were
the
more
dearly
prized
it
was
almost
before
i
reached
home
somehow
in
this
grand
weather
welcome
as
dinner
always
was
it
did
not
possess
the
same
amount
of
interest
as
in
the
cold
bitter
winter
this
day
i
almost
hurried
over
mine
to
get
out
again
into
the
broad
sunlight
oh
how
stately
the
hollyhocks
towered
on
the
borders
of
the
shrubbery
the
hung
like
balls
of
snow
in
their
wilderness
of
green
leaves
and
here
and
there
the
damask
roses
dark
almost
to
blackness
and
with
a
soft
velvety
surface
enriched
the
sunny
air
with
their
colour
and
their
scent
i
never
see
these
roses
now
and
the
little
bushes
of
polyanthus
gemmed
the
dark
earth
between
with
their
varied
hues
we
did
not
know
anything
about
flowers
except
the
delight
they
gave
us
and
i
dare
say
i
am
putting
some
together
which
would
not
be
out
at
the
same
time
but
that
is
how
the
picture
comes
back
to
my
memory
i
was
leaning
in
utter
idleness
over
the
gate
that
separated
the
little
lawn
and
its
surroundings
from
the
road
when
a
troop
of
children
passed
with
little
baskets
and
tin
pails
in
their
hands
and
amongst
them
jamie
duff
it
was
not
in
the
least
necessary
to
ask
him
where
he
was
going
not
very
far
about
a
mile
or
so
from
our
house
rose
a
certain
hill
famed
in
the
country
round
for
its
store
of
bilberries
it
was
the
same
to
which
turkey
and
i
had
fled
for
refuge
from
the
bull
it
was
called
the
ba
hill
and
a
tradition
lingered
in
the
neighbourhood
that
many
years
ago
there
had
been
a
battle
there
and
that
after
the
battle
the
conquerors
played
at
football
with
the
heads
of
the
vanquished
slain
and
hence
the
name
of
the
hill
but
who
fought
or
which
conquered
there
was
not
a
shadow
of
a
record
it
had
been
a
wild
country
and
conflicting
clans
had
often
wrought
wild
work
in
it
in
summer
the
hill
was
of
course
the
haunt
of
children
gathering
its
bilberries
jamie
shyly
suggested
whether
i
would
not
join
them
but
they
were
all
too
much
younger
than
myself
and
besides
i
felt
drawn
to
seek
turkey
in
the
field
with
the
cattle
that
is
when
i
should
get
quite
tired
of
doing
nothing
so
the
little
troop
streamed
on
and
i
remained
leaning
over
the
gate
i
suppose
i
had
sunk
into
a
dreamy
state
for
i
was
suddenly
startled
by
a
sound
beside
me
and
looking
about
saw
an
old
woman
bent
nearly
double
within
an
old
grey
cloak
notwithstanding
the
heat
she
leaned
on
a
stick
and
carried
a
bag
like
a
in
her
hand
it
was
one
of
the
poor
people
of
the
village
going
her
rounds
for
her
weekly
dole
of
a
handful
of
oatmeal
i
knew
her
very
well
by
sight
and
by
name
she
was
old
eppie
and
a
kindly
greeting
passed
between
us
i
thank
god
that
the
frightful
had
not
invaded
scotland
when
i
was
a
boy
there
was
no
degradation
in
honest
poverty
then
and
it
was
no
burden
to
those
who
supplied
its
wants
while
every
person
was
known
and
kindly
feelings
were
nourished
on
both
sides
if
i
understand
anything
of
human
nature
now
it
comes
partly
of
having
known
and
respected
the
poor
of
my
father
s
parish
she
passed
in
at
the
gate
and
went
as
usual
to
the
kitchen
door
while
i
stood
drowsily
contemplating
the
green
expanse
of
growing
crops
in
the
valley
before
me
the
day
had
grown
as
sleepy
as
myself
there
were
no
noises
except
the
hum
of
the
unseen
insects
and
the
distant
rush
of
the
water
over
the
dams
at
our
in
a
few
minutes
the
old
woman
approached
me
again
she
was
an
honest
and
worthy
soul
and
very
civil
in
her
manners
therefore
i
was
surprised
to
hear
her
muttering
to
herself
turning
i
saw
she
was
very
angry
she
ceased
her
muttering
when
she
descried
me
observing
her
and
walked
on
in
silence
was
even
about
to
pass
through
the
little
wicket
at
the
side
of
the
larger
gate
without
any
further
salutation
something
had
vexed
her
and
instinctively
i
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
halfpenny
my
father
had
given
me
that
morning
very
few
of
which
came
in
my
way
and
offered
it
to
her
she
took
it
with
a
glance
an
attempt
at
a
courtesy
and
a
murmured
blessing
then
for
a
moment
she
looked
as
if
about
to
say
something
but
changing
her
mind
she
only
added
another
grateful
word
and
hobbled
away
i
pondered
in
a
feeble
fashion
for
a
moment
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
kelpie
had
been
rude
to
her
forgot
her
and
fell
again
growing
at
length
tired
of
doing
nothing
i
roused
myself
and
set
out
to
seek
turkey
i
have
lingered
almost
foolishly
over
this
day
but
when
i
recall
my
childhood
this
day
always
comes
back
as
a
type
of
the
best
of
it
i
remember
i
visited
kirsty
to
find
out
where
turkey
was
kirsty
welcomed
me
as
usual
for
she
was
always
loving
and
kind
to
us
and
although
i
did
not
visit
her
so
often
now
she
knew
it
was
because
i
was
more
with
my
father
and
had
lessons
to
learn
in
which
she
could
not
assist
me
having
nothing
else
to
talk
about
i
told
her
of
eppie
and
her
altered
looks
when
she
came
out
of
the
house
kirsty
compressed
her
lips
nodded
her
head
looked
serious
and
made
me
no
reply
thinking
this
was
strange
i
resolved
to
tell
turkey
which
otherwise
i
might
not
have
done
i
did
not
pursue
the
matter
with
kirsty
for
i
knew
her
well
enough
to
know
that
her
manner
indicated
a
mood
out
of
which
nothing
could
be
drawn
having
learned
where
he
was
i
set
out
to
find
him
close
by
the
scene
of
our
adventure
with
wandering
willie
i
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
cattle
feeding
but
did
not
see
turkey
when
i
came
near
the
mound
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
head
of
old
gregson
s
cow
quietly
feeding
off
the
top
of
the
wall
from
the
other
side
like
an
outcast
gentile
while
my
father
s
cows
like
the
favoured
and
greedy
jews
were
busy
in
the
short
clover
inside
grannie
s
cow
managed
to
live
notwithstanding
and
i
dare
say
gave
as
good
milk
though
not
perhaps
quite
so
much
of
it
as
hawkie
gregson
s
granddaughter
however
who
did
not
eat
grass
was
inside
the
wall
seated
on
a
stone
which
turkey
had
no
doubt
dragged
there
for
her
trust
both
her
and
turkey
the
cow
should
not
have
a
mouthful
without
leave
of
my
father
elsie
was
as
usual
busy
with
her
knitting
and
now
i
caught
sight
of
turkey
running
from
a
neighbouring
cottage
with
a
spade
over
his
shoulder
elsie
had
been
minding
the
cows
for
him
what
s
ado
turkey
i
cried
running
to
meet
him
such
a
wild
bees
nest
answered
turkey
i
m
so
glad
you
re
come
i
was
just
thinking
whether
i
wouldn
t
run
and
fetch
you
elsie
and
i
have
been
watching
them
going
out
and
in
for
the
last
such
lots
of
bees
there
s
a
store
of
honey
but
isn
t
it
too
soon
to
take
it
turkey
there
ll
be
a
great
deal
more
in
a
few
not
that
i
know
anything
about
bees
i
added
deferentially
you
re
quite
right
ranald
answered
turkey
but
there
are
several
things
to
be
considered
in
the
first
place
the
nest
is
by
the
roadside
and
somebody
else
might
find
it
next
elsie
has
never
tasted
honey
all
her
life
and
it
so
nice
and
here
she
is
all
ready
to
eat
some
thirdly
and
lastly
as
your
father
says
though
not
very
often
added
turkey
slyly
meaning
that
the
seldom
came
with
the
if
we
take
the
honey
now
the
bees
will
have
plenty
of
time
to
gather
enough
for
the
winter
before
the
flowers
are
gone
whereas
if
we
leave
it
too
long
they
will
i
was
satisfied
with
this
reasoning
and
made
no
further
objection
you
must
keep
a
sharp
though
ranald
he
said
for
they
ll
be
mad
enough
and
you
must
keep
them
off
with
your
he
took
off
his
own
and
gave
it
to
elsie
saying
here
elsie
you
must
look
out
and
keep
off
the
bees
i
can
tell
you
a
sting
is
no
joke
i
ve
had
three
but
what
are
to
do
turkey
asked
elsie
with
an
anxious
face
oh
ranald
will
keep
them
off
me
and
himself
too
i
shan
t
heed
them
i
must
dig
away
and
get
at
the
all
things
being
thus
arranged
turkey
manfully
approached
the
as
they
call
any
kind
of
there
in
the
midst
of
the
grass
and
moss
was
one
little
hole
through
which
the
bees
kept
going
and
coming
very
busily
turkey
put
in
his
finger
and
felt
in
what
direction
the
hole
went
and
thence
judging
the
position
of
the
hoard
struck
his
spade
with
firm
foot
into
the
dyke
what
bees
were
in
came
rushing
out
in
fear
and
rage
and
i
had
quite
enough
to
do
to
keep
them
off
our
bare
heads
with
my
cap
those
who
were
returning
laden
as
they
were
joined
in
the
defence
but
i
did
my
best
and
with
tolerable
success
elsie
being
at
a
little
distance
and
comparatively
still
was
less
the
object
of
their
resentment
in
a
few
moments
turkey
had
reached
the
store
then
he
began
to
dig
about
it
carefully
to
keep
from
spoiling
the
honey
first
he
took
out
a
quantity
of
cells
with
nothing
in
them
but
things
the
cradles
of
the
young
bees
they
were
he
threw
them
away
and
went
on
digging
as
coolly
as
if
he
had
been
gardening
all
the
defence
he
left
to
me
and
i
assure
you
i
had
enough
of
it
and
thought
mine
the
harder
work
of
the
two
hand
or
eye
had
no
rest
and
my
mind
was
on
the
stretch
of
anxiety
all
the
time
but
now
turkey
stooped
to
the
nest
cleared
away
the
earth
about
it
with
his
hands
and
with
much
care
drew
out
a
great
piece
of
honeycomb
just
as
well
put
together
as
the
comb
of
any
educated
bees
in
a
who
know
that
they
are
working
for
critics
its
surface
was
even
and
yellow
showing
that
the
cells
were
full
to
the
brim
of
the
rich
store
i
think
i
see
turkey
weighing
it
in
his
hand
and
turning
it
over
to
pick
away
some
bits
of
adhering
mould
ere
he
presented
it
to
elsie
she
sat
on
her
stone
like
a
patient
contented
queen
waiting
for
what
her
subjects
would
bring
her
illustration
oh
turkey
what
a
piece
she
said
as
she
took
it
and
opened
her
pretty
mouth
and
white
teeth
to
have
a
bite
of
the
treasure
now
ranald
said
turkey
we
must
finish
the
job
before
we
have
any
he
went
on
carefully
removing
the
honey
and
piling
it
on
the
bank
there
was
not
a
great
deal
because
it
was
so
early
in
the
year
and
there
was
not
another
comb
to
equal
that
he
had
given
elsie
but
when
he
had
got
it
all
out
they
ll
soon
find
another
nest
he
said
i
don
t
think
it
s
any
use
leaving
this
open
for
them
it
spoils
the
dyke
as
he
spoke
he
began
to
fill
up
the
hole
and
beat
the
earth
down
hard
last
of
all
he
put
in
the
sod
first
dug
away
with
the
grass
and
flowers
still
growing
upon
it
this
done
he
proceeded
to
divide
what
remained
of
the
honey
there
s
a
piece
for
allister
and
davie
he
said
and
here
s
a
piece
for
you
and
this
for
me
and
elsie
can
take
the
rest
home
for
herself
and
elsie
protested
but
we
both
insisted
turkey
got
some
nice
clover
and
laid
the
bits
of
honeycomb
in
it
then
we
sat
and
ate
our
shares
and
chatted
away
for
a
long
time
turkey
and
i
getting
up
every
now
and
then
to
look
after
the
cattle
and
elsie
too
having
sometimes
to
follow
her
cow
when
she
threatened
an
inroad
upon
some
neighbouring
field
while
we
were
away
but
there
was
plenty
of
time
between
and
elsie
sung
us
two
or
three
songs
at
our
earnest
request
and
turkey
told
us
one
or
two
stories
out
of
history
books
he
had
been
reading
and
i
pulled
out
my
story
of
the
robins
and
read
to
them
and
so
the
hot
sun
went
down
the
glowing
west
and
threw
longer
and
longer
shadows
eastward
a
great
shapeless
blot
of
darkness
with
legs
to
it
accompanied
every
cow
and
calf
and
bullock
wherever
it
went
there
was
a
new
shadow
crop
in
the
grass
and
a
huge
patch
with
long
at
the
end
of
it
stretched
away
from
the
foot
of
the
hillock
the
weathercock
on
the
top
of
the
church
was
glistening
such
a
bright
gold
that
the
wonder
was
how
it
could
keep
from
breaking
out
into
a
crow
that
would
rouse
all
the
cocks
of
the
neighbourhood
even
although
they
were
beginning
to
get
sleepy
and
thinking
of
going
to
roost
it
was
time
for
the
cattle
elsie
s
cow
included
to
go
home
for
although
the
latter
had
not
had
such
plenty
to
eat
from
as
the
rest
she
had
been
at
it
all
day
and
had
come
upon
several
very
nice
little
patches
of
clover
that
had
overflowed
the
edges
of
the
fields
into
the
levels
and
the
now
dry
ditches
on
the
sides
of
the
road
but
just
as
we
rose
to
break
up
the
assembly
we
spied
a
little
girl
come
flying
across
the
field
as
if
winged
with
news
as
she
came
nearer
we
recognized
her
she
lived
near
gregson
s
cottage
and
was
one
of
the
little
troop
whom
i
had
seen
pass
the
manse
on
their
way
to
gather
bilberries
elsie
elsie
she
cried
john
adam
has
taken
jamie
jamie
fell
and
john
got
elsie
looked
frightened
but
turkey
laughed
saying
never
mind
elsie
john
is
better
than
he
looks
he
won
t
do
him
the
least
harm
he
must
mind
his
business
you
the
ba
hill
was
covered
with
a
young
plantation
of
firs
which
hardy
as
they
were
had
yet
in
a
measure
to
be
coaxed
into
growing
in
that
inclement
region
it
was
amongst
their
small
stems
that
the
coveted
bilberries
grew
in
company
with
cranberries
and
crowberries
and
dwarf
junipers
the
children
of
the
village
thus
attracted
to
the
place
were
no
doubt
careless
of
the
young
trees
and
might
sometimes
even
amuse
themselves
with
doing
them
damage
hence
the
keeper
john
adam
whose
business
it
was
to
look
after
them
found
it
his
duty
to
wage
war
upon
the
annual
hordes
of
these
invaders
and
in
their
eyes
adam
was
a
terrible
man
he
was
very
long
and
very
lean
with
a
flattish
yet
roman
nose
and
rather
mouth
while
his
face
was
and
much
pitted
with
the
he
wore
corduroy
breeches
a
blue
coat
and
a
nightcap
striped
horizontally
with
black
and
red
the
youngsters
pretended
to
determine
by
the
direction
in
which
the
tassel
of
it
hung
what
mood
its
owner
was
in
nor
is
it
for
me
to
deny
that
their
inductions
may
have
led
them
to
conclusions
quite
as
correct
as
those
of
some
other
scientific
observers
at
all
events
the
tassel
was
a
warning
a
terror
and
a
hope
he
could
not
run
very
fast
fortunately
for
the
lean
legs
within
those
ribbed
grey
stockings
were
subject
to
rheumatism
and
could
take
only
long
not
rapid
strides
and
if
the
children
had
a
tolerable
start
and
had
not
the
misfortune
to
choose
in
their
terror
an
impassable
direction
they
were
pretty
sure
to
get
off
jamie
duff
the
most
harmless
and
conscientious
creature
who
would
not
have
injured
a
young
fir
upon
any
temptation
did
take
a
wrong
direction
caught
his
foot
in
a
hole
fell
into
a
furze
bush
and
nearly
paralysed
with
terror
was
seized
by
the
long
fingers
of
adam
and
ignominiously
lifted
by
a
portion
of
his
garments
into
the
vast
aërial
space
between
the
ground
and
the
white
face
of
the
keeper
too
frightened
to
scream
too
conscious
of
trespass
to
make
any
resistance
he
was
borne
off
as
a
warning
to
the
rest
of
the
very
improbable
fate
which
awaited
them
but
the
character
of
adam
was
not
by
any
means
so
frightful
in
the
eyes
of
turkey
and
he
soon
succeeded
in
partially
composing
the
trepidation
of
elsie
assuring
her
that
as
soon
as
he
had
put
up
the
cattle
he
would
walk
over
to
adam
s
house
and
try
to
get
jamie
off
whereupon
elsie
set
off
home
with
her
cow
disconsolate
but
hopeful
i
think
i
see
her
yet
for
i
recall
every
picture
of
that
lovely
day
clear
as
the
light
of
that
red
sunset
walking
slowly
with
her
head
bent
half
in
trouble
half
in
attention
to
her
knitting
after
her
solemn
cow
which
seemed
to
take
twice
as
long
to
get
over
the
ground
because
she
had
two
pairs
of
legs
instead
of
one
to
shuffle
across
it
dragging
her
long
iron
chain
with
the
short
stake
at
the
end
after
her
with
a
gentle
clatter
over
the
hard
dry
road
i
accompanied
turkey
helped
him
to
fasten
up
and
bed
the
cows
went
in
with
him
and
shared
his
hasty
supper
of
potatoes
and
oatcake
and
milk
and
then
set
out
refreshed
and
nowise
apprehensive
in
his
company
to
seek
the
abode
of
the
redoubtable
ogre
john
adam
chapter
xxii
vain
intercession
he
had
a
small
farm
of
his
own
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
of
which
he
had
the
charge
it
was
a
poor
little
place
with
a
very
low
thatched
cottage
for
the
dwelling
a
sister
kept
house
for
him
when
we
approached
it
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
we
advanced
to
the
door
along
a
rough
pavement
of
round
stones
which
parted
the
house
from
the
dunghill
i
peeped
in
at
the
little
window
as
we
passed
there
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
jamie
duff
as
i
thought
looking
very
happy
and
in
the
act
of
lifting
a
spoon
to
his
mouth
a
moment
after
however
i
concluded
that
i
must
have
been
mistaken
for
when
turkey
lifted
the
latch
and
we
walked
in
there
were
the
awful
john
and
his
long
sister
seated
at
the
table
while
poor
jamie
was
in
a
corner
with
no
basin
in
his
hand
and
a
face
that
looked
dismal
and
dreary
enough
i
fancied
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
turkey
laughing
in
his
sleeve
and
felt
mildly
indignant
with
him
for
elsie
s
sake
more
i
confess
than
for
jamie
s
come
in
said
adam
rising
but
seeing
who
it
was
he
seated
himself
again
adding
oh
it
s
you
turkey
everybody
called
him
turkey
come
in
and
take
a
no
thank
you
said
turkey
i
have
had
my
supper
i
only
came
to
inquire
after
that
young
rascal
ah
you
see
him
there
he
is
said
adam
looking
towards
me
with
an
awful
expression
in
his
dead
brown
eyes
starving
no
home
and
no
supper
for
him
he
ll
have
to
sleep
in
the
with
the
rats
and
mice
and
a
stray
cat
or
jamie
put
his
cuffs
the
perennial
handkerchief
of
our
poor
little
brothers
to
his
eyes
his
fate
was
full
of
horrors
but
again
i
thought
i
saw
turkey
laughing
in
his
sleeve
his
sister
is
very
anxious
about
him
adam
he
said
couldn
t
you
let
him
off
this
once
on
no
account
i
am
here
in
trust
and
i
must
do
my
duty
the
duke
gives
the
forest
in
charge
to
me
i
have
got
to
look
after
i
could
not
help
thinking
what
a
poor
thing
it
was
for
a
forest
all
i
knew
of
forests
was
from
and
there
they
were
full
of
ever
such
grand
trees
adam
went
on
and
if
wicked
boys
will
break
down
the
trees
i
only
pulled
the
bilberries
interposed
jamie
in
a
whine
which
went
off
in
a
howl
james
duff
said
adam
with
awful
authority
i
saw
you
myself
tumble
over
a
young
larch
tree
not
two
feet
the
worse
for
me
sobbed
jamie
tut
tut
adam
the
larch
tree
wasn
t
a
baby
said
turkey
let
jamie
go
he
couldn
t
help
it
you
it
a
baby
and
it
a
baby
said
adam
with
a
solitary
twinkle
in
the
determined
dead
brown
of
his
eyes
and
i
ll
have
no
intercession
here
transgressors
must
be
prosecuted
as
the
board
says
and
prosecuted
he
shall
be
he
sha
n
t
get
out
of
this
before
morning
he
shall
be
late
too
and
i
hope
the
master
will
give
it
him
well
we
must
make
some
examples
you
see
turkey
it
s
no
use
your
saying
anything
i
don
t
say
jamie
s
a
worse
boy
than
the
rest
but
he
s
just
as
bad
else
how
did
he
come
to
be
there
tumbling
over
my
babies
answer
me
that
master
he
turned
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
me
there
was
question
in
his
mouth
but
neither
question
nor
speculation
in
his
eyes
i
could
not
meet
the
awful
changeless
gaze
my
eyes
sank
before
his
example
master
bannerman
is
everything
if
you
serve
my
trees
as
this
young
man
has
done
the
idea
of
james
duff
being
a
young
man
i
ll
serve
you
the
same
as
i
serve
him
and
that
s
no
sweet
service
i
ll
as
the
keeper
ended
he
brought
down
his
fist
on
the
table
with
such
a
bang
that
poor
jamie
almost
fell
off
the
stool
on
which
he
sat
in
the
corner
but
let
him
off
just
this
once
pleaded
turkey
and
i
ll
be
surety
for
him
that
he
ll
never
do
it
oh
as
to
him
i
m
not
afraid
of
him
returned
the
keeper
but
will
you
be
surety
for
the
fifty
boys
that
ll
only
make
game
of
me
if
i
don
t
make
an
example
of
him
i
m
in
luck
to
have
caught
him
no
no
turkey
it
won
t
do
my
man
i
m
sorry
for
his
father
and
his
mother
and
his
sister
elsie
for
they
re
all
very
good
people
but
i
must
make
an
example
of
at
mention
of
his
relatives
jamie
burst
into
another
suppressed
howl
well
you
won
t
be
over
hard
upon
him
anyhow
will
you
now
said
turkey
i
won
t
pull
his
skin
over
his
ears
said
adam
and
that
s
all
the
promise
you
ll
get
out
of
the
tall
thin
grim
sister
had
sat
all
the
time
as
if
she
had
no
right
to
be
aware
of
anything
that
was
going
on
but
her
nose
which
was
more
hooked
than
her
brother
s
and
larger
looked
as
if
in
the
absence
of
eyes
and
ears
it
was
taking
cognizance
of
everything
and
would
inform
the
rest
of
the
senses
afterwards
i
had
a
suspicion
that
the
keeper
s
ferocity
was
assumed
for
the
occasion
and
that
he
was
not
such
an
ogre
as
i
had
considered
him
still
the
prospect
of
poor
little
jamie
spending
the
night
alone
in
the
loft
amongst
the
cats
and
rats
was
sufficiently
dreadful
when
i
thought
of
my
midnight
awaking
in
the
barn
there
seemed
to
be
no
help
however
especially
when
turkey
rose
to
say
good
night
i
felt
disconsolate
and
was
not
well
pleased
with
turkey
s
coolness
i
thought
he
had
not
done
his
best
when
we
got
into
the
road
poor
elsie
i
said
she
ll
be
miserable
about
oh
no
returned
turkey
i
ll
go
straight
over
and
tell
her
no
harm
will
come
to
jamie
john
adam
s
bark
is
a
good
deal
worse
than
his
bite
only
i
should
have
liked
to
take
him
home
if
i
it
was
now
twilight
and
through
the
glimmering
dusk
we
walked
back
to
the
manse
turkey
left
me
at
the
gate
and
strode
on
towards
the
village
while
i
turned
in
revolving
a
new
scheme
which
had
arisen
in
my
brain
and
for
the
first
time
a
sense
of
rivalry
with
turkey
awoke
in
my
bosom
he
did
everything
for
elsie
duff
and
i
did
nothing
for
her
he
had
robbed
the
bees
nest
that
very
day
and
i
had
but
partaken
of
the
spoil
nay
he
had
been
stung
in
her
service
for
with
all
my
care
and
i
think
that
on
the
whole
i
had
done
my
best
he
had
received
what
threatened
to
be
a
bad
sting
on
the
back
of
his
neck
now
he
was
going
to
comfort
her
about
her
brother
whom
he
had
failed
to
rescue
but
what
if
i
should
succeed
where
he
had
failed
and
carry
the
poor
boy
home
in
triumph
as
we
left
the
keeper
s
farm
turkey
had
pointed
out
to
me
across
the
yard
where
a
small
rick
or
two
were
standing
the
loft
in
which
jamie
would
have
to
sleep
it
was
over
the
and
its
approach
was
a
ladder
but
for
the
reported
rats
it
would
have
been
no
hardship
to
sleep
there
in
weather
like
this
especially
for
one
who
had
been
brought
up
as
jamie
had
been
but
i
knew
that
he
was
a
very
timid
boy
and
that
i
myself
would
have
lain
in
horror
all
the
night
therefore
i
had
all
the
way
been
turning
over
in
my
mind
what
i
could
do
to
release
him
but
whatever
i
did
must
be
unaided
for
i
could
not
reckon
upon
turkey
nor
indeed
was
it
in
my
heart
to
share
with
him
the
honour
of
the
enterprise
that
opened
before
me
chapter
xxiii
i
must
mention
that
my
father
never
objected
now
to
my
riding
his
little
mare
missy
as
we
called
her
indeed
i
had
great
liberty
with
regard
to
her
and
took
her
out
for
a
trot
and
a
gallop
as
often
as
i
pleased
sometimes
when
there
was
a
press
of
work
she
would
have
to
go
in
a
cart
or
drag
a
harrow
for
she
was
so
handy
they
could
do
anything
with
her
but
this
did
not
happen
often
and
her
condition
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
testified
that
she
knew
little
of
hard
work
my
father
was
very
fond
of
her
and
used
to
tell
wonderful
stories
of
her
judgment
and
skill
i
believe
he
was
never
quite
without
a
hope
that
somehow
or
other
he
should
find
her
again
in
the
next
world
at
all
events
i
am
certain
that
it
was
hard
for
him
to
believe
that
so
much
wise
affection
should
have
been
created
to
be
again
uncreated
i
can
not
say
that
i
ever
heard
him
give
utterance
to
anything
of
the
sort
but
whence
else
should
i
have
had
such
a
firm
conviction
dating
from
a
period
farther
back
than
my
memory
can
reach
that
whatever
might
become
of
the
other
horses
missy
was
sure
to
go
to
heaven
i
had
a
kind
of
notion
that
being
the
bearer
of
my
father
upon
all
his
missions
of
doctrine
and
mercy
she
belonged
to
the
clergy
and
sharing
in
their
privileges
must
have
a
chance
before
other
animals
of
her
kind
i
believe
this
was
a
right
instinct
glad
of
a
foolish
reason
i
am
wiser
now
and
extend
the
hope
to
the
rest
of
the
horses
for
i
can
not
believe
that
the
god
who
does
nothing
in
vain
ever
creates
in
order
to
destroy
i
made
haste
to
learn
my
lessons
for
the
monday
although
it
was
but
after
a
fashion
my
mind
was
so
full
of
the
adventure
before
me
as
soon
as
prayers
and
supper
were
over
that
is
about
ten
o
clock
i
crept
out
of
the
house
and
away
to
the
stable
it
was
a
lovely
night
a
kind
of
grey
peace
filled
earth
and
air
and
sky
it
was
not
dark
although
rather
cloudy
only
a
dim
dusk
like
a
vapour
of
darkness
floated
around
everything
i
was
fond
of
being
out
at
night
but
i
had
never
before
contemplated
going
so
far
alone
i
should
not
however
feel
alone
with
missy
under
me
for
she
and
i
were
on
the
best
of
terms
although
sometimes
she
would
take
a
fit
of
obstinacy
and
refuse
to
go
in
any
other
than
the
direction
she
pleased
of
late
however
she
had
asserted
herself
less
frequently
in
this
manner
i
suppose
she
was
aware
that
i
grew
stronger
and
more
determined
i
soon
managed
to
open
the
door
of
the
stable
for
i
knew
where
the
key
lay
it
was
very
dark
but
i
felt
my
way
through
talking
all
the
time
that
the
horses
might
not
be
startled
if
i
came
upon
one
of
them
unexpectedly
for
the
stable
was
narrow
and
they
sometimes
lay
a
good
bit
out
of
their
stalls
i
took
care
however
to
speak
in
a
low
tone
that
the
man
who
slept
with
only
a
wooden
partition
between
him
and
the
stable
might
not
hear
i
soon
had
the
bridle
upon
missy
but
would
not
lose
time
in
putting
on
the
saddle
i
led
her
out
got
on
her
back
with
the
help
of
a
stone
at
the
stable
door
and
rode
away
she
had
scarcely
been
out
all
day
and
was
rather
in
the
mood
for
a
ride
the
voice
of
andrew
whom
the
noise
of
her
feet
had
aroused
came
after
me
calling
to
know
who
it
was
i
called
out
in
reply
for
i
feared
he
might
rouse
the
place
and
he
went
back
composed
if
not
contented
it
was
no
use
at
all
events
to
follow
me
i
had
not
gone
far
before
the
extreme
stillness
of
the
night
began
to
sink
into
my
soul
and
make
me
quiet
everything
seemed
thinking
about
me
but
nothing
would
tell
me
what
it
thought
not
feeling
however
that
i
was
doing
wrong
i
was
only
awed
not
frightened
by
the
stillness
i
made
missy
slacken
her
speed
and
rode
on
more
gently
in
better
harmony
with
the
night
not
a
sound
broke
the
silence
except
the
rough
cry
of
the
from
the
fields
and
the
clatter
of
missy
s
feet
i
did
not
like
the
noise
she
made
and
got
upon
the
grass
for
here
there
was
no
fence
but
the
moment
she
felt
the
soft
grass
off
she
went
at
a
sudden
gallop
her
head
was
out
before
i
had
the
least
warning
of
her
intention
she
tore
away
over
the
field
in
quite
another
direction
from
that
in
which
i
had
been
taking
her
and
the
gallop
quickened
until
she
was
going
at
her
utmost
speed
the
rapidity
of
the
motion
and
the
darkness
together
for
it
seemed
darkness
now
i
confess
made
me
frightened
i
pulled
hard
at
the
reins
but
without
avail
in
a
minute
i
had
lost
my
reckoning
and
could
not
tell
where
i
was
in
the
field
which
was
a
pretty
large
one
but
soon
finding
that
we
were
galloping
down
a
hill
so
steep
that
i
had
trouble
in
retaining
my
seat
i
began
not
at
all
to
my
comfort
to
surmise
in
what
direction
the
mare
was
carrying
me
we
were
approaching
the
place
where
we
had
sat
that
same
afternoon
close
by
the
mound
with
the
trees
upon
it
the
scene
of
my
adventure
with
wandering
willie
and
of
the
fancied
murder
i
had
scarcely
thought
of
either
until
the
shadows
had
begun
to
fall
long
and
now
in
the
night
when
all
was
shadow
both
reflections
made
it
horrible
besides
if
missy
should
get
into
the
bog
but
she
knew
better
than
that
wild
as
her
mood
was
she
avoided
it
and
galloped
past
but
bore
me
to
a
far
more
frightful
goal
suddenly
dropping
into
a
canter
and
then
standing
it
was
a
cottage
half
in
ruins
occupied
by
an
old
woman
whom
i
dimly
recollected
having
once
gone
with
my
father
to
see
a
good
many
years
ago
as
it
appeared
to
me
now
she
was
still
alive
however
very
old
and
bedridden
i
recollected
that
from
the
top
of
her
wooden
bed
hung
a
rope
for
her
to
pull
herself
up
by
when
she
wanted
to
turn
for
she
was
very
rheumatic
and
this
rope
for
some
cause
or
other
had
filled
me
with
horror
but
there
was
more
of
the
same
sort
the
cottage
had
once
been
a
smithy
and
the
bellows
had
been
left
in
its
place
now
there
is
nothing
particularly
frightful
about
a
pair
of
bellows
however
large
it
may
be
and
yet
the
recollection
of
that
huge
structure
of
leather
and
wood
with
the
great
iron
nose
projecting
from
the
contracting
cheeks
of
it
at
the
head
of
the
old
woman
s
bed
so
capable
yet
so
useless
did
return
upon
me
with
terror
in
the
dusk
of
that
lonely
night
it
was
mingled
with
a
vague
suspicion
that
the
old
woman
was
a
bit
of
a
witch
and
a
very
doubtful
memory
that
she
had
been
seen
on
one
occasion
by
some
when
a
frightful
storm
was
raging
blowing
away
at
that
very
bellows
as
hard
as
her
skinny
arms
and
lean
body
could
work
the
lever
so
that
there
was
almost
as
great
a
storm
of
wind
in
her
little
room
as
there
was
outside
of
it
if
there
was
any
truth
in
the
story
it
is
easily
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
poor
old
woman
had
been
a
little
out
of
her
mind
for
many
years
and
no
wonder
for
she
was
nearly
a
hundred
they
said
neither
is
it
any
wonder
that
when
missy
stopped
almost
suddenly
with
her
and
her
neck
stretched
forward
and
her
nose
pointed
straight
for
the
door
of
the
cottage
at
a
few
yards
distance
i
should
have
felt
very
queer
indeed
whether
my
hair
stood
on
end
or
not
i
do
not
know
but
i
certainly
did
feel
my
skin
creep
all
over
me
an
ancient
grew
at
one
end
of
the
cottage
and
i
heard
the
lonely
sigh
of
a
little
breeze
wander
through
its
branches
the
next
instant
a
frightful
sound
from
within
the
cottage
broke
the
night
air
into
what
seemed
a
universal
shriek
missy
gave
a
plunge
turned
round
on
her
and
tore
from
the
place
i
very
nearly
lost
my
seat
but
terror
made
me
cling
the
faster
to
my
only
companion
as
she
flew
home
it
did
not
take
her
a
minute
to
reach
the
there
she
had
to
stop
for
i
had
shut
it
when
i
brought
her
out
it
was
mortifying
to
find
myself
there
instead
of
under
john
adam
s
hayloft
the
rescuer
of
jamie
duff
but
i
did
not
think
of
that
for
a
while
shaken
with
terror
and
afraid
to
dismount
and
be
next
the
ground
i
called
upon
andrew
as
well
as
my
fear
would
permit
but
my
voice
was
nearly
unmanageable
and
i
could
do
little
more
than
howl
with
it
in
a
few
minutes
to
me
a
time
of
awful
duration
for
who
could
tell
what
might
be
following
me
up
from
the
hollow
andrew
appeared
and
not
in
the
best
of
tempers
remarking
it
was
an
odd
thing
to
go
out
riding
when
honest
people
were
in
their
beds
except
he
added
i
meant
to
take
to
the
highway
thereupon
rendered
more
communicative
by
the
trial
i
had
gone
through
i
told
him
the
whole
story
what
i
had
intended
and
how
i
had
been
frustrated
he
listened
scratched
his
head
and
saying
someone
ought
to
see
if
anything
was
the
matter
with
the
old
woman
turned
in
to
put
on
the
rest
of
his
clothes
you
had
better
go
home
to
bed
ranald
he
said
won
t
you
be
frightened
andrew
i
asked
frightened
what
should
i
be
frightened
at
it
s
all
waste
to
be
frightened
before
you
know
whether
the
thing
is
worth
my
courage
had
been
reviving
fast
in
the
warm
presence
of
a
human
being
i
was
still
seated
on
missy
to
go
home
having
done
nothing
for
jamie
and
therefore
nothing
for
elsie
after
all
my
grand
ideas
of
rescue
and
restoration
was
too
mortifying
i
should
feel
so
small
when
i
woke
in
the
morning
and
yet
suppose
the
something
which
gave
that
fearful
cry
in
the
cottage
should
be
out
roaming
the
fields
and
looking
for
mel
i
had
courage
enough
however
to
remain
where
i
was
till
andrew
came
out
again
and
as
i
sat
still
on
the
mare
s
back
my
courage
gradually
rose
nothing
increases
terror
so
much
as
running
away
when
he
reappeared
i
asked
him
what
do
you
think
it
could
be
andrew
how
should
i
tell
returned
andrew
the
old
woman
has
a
very
queer
cock
i
know
that
always
roosts
on
the
top
of
her
bed
and
crows
like
no
cock
i
ever
heard
crow
or
it
might
be
wandering
willie
he
goes
to
see
her
sometimes
and
the
demented
creature
might
strike
up
his
pipes
at
any
unearthly
i
was
not
satisfied
with
either
suggestion
but
the
sound
i
had
heard
had
already
grown
so
indistinct
in
my
memory
that
for
anything
i
could
tell
it
might
have
been
either
the
terror
which
it
woke
in
my
mind
had
rendered
me
incapable
of
making
any
observations
or
setting
down
any
facts
with
regard
to
it
i
could
only
remember
that
i
had
heard
a
frightful
noise
but
as
to
what
it
was
like
i
could
scarcely
bear
the
smallest
testimony
i
begged
andrew
to
put
the
saddle
on
for
me
as
i
should
then
have
more
command
of
missy
he
went
and
got
it
appearing
i
thought
not
at
all
about
old
betty
and
i
meantime
buckled
on
an
old
rusty
spur
which
lay
in
the
stable
window
the
leathers
of
it
crumbling
off
in
flakes
thus
armed
and
mounted
with
my
feet
in
the
stirrups
and
therefore
a
good
pull
on
missy
s
mouth
i
found
my
courage
once
more
equal
to
the
task
before
me
andrew
and
i
parted
at
right
angles
he
across
the
field
to
old
betty
s
cottage
and
i
along
the
road
once
more
in
the
direction

john
adam
s
farm
chapter
xxiv
failure
it
must
have
been
now
about
eleven
o
clock
the
clouds
had
cleared
off
and
the
night
had
changed
from
brown
and
grey
to
blue
sparkling
with
gold
i
could
see
much
better
and
fancied
i
could
hear
better
too
but
neither
advantage
did
much
for
me
i
had
not
ridden
far
from
the
stable
before
i
again
found
myself
very
much
alone
and
unprotected
with
only
the
wide
silent
fields
about
me
and
the
wider
and
more
silent
sky
over
my
head
the
fear
began
to
return
i
fancied
something
strange
creeping
along
every
ditch
something
shapeless
but
with
a
terrible
cry
in
it
next
i
thought
i
saw
a
scarcely
visible
form
now
like
a
creature
on
now
like
a
man
far
off
but
coming
rapidly
towards
me
across
the
nearest
field
it
always
vanished
however
before
it
came
close
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
faster
i
rode
the
more
frightened
i
became
for
my
speed
seemed
to
draw
the
terrors
the
faster
after
me
having
discovered
this
i
changed
my
plan
and
when
i
felt
more
frightened
drew
rein
and
went
slower
this
was
to
throw
a
sort
of
defiance
to
the
fear
and
certainly
as
often
as
i
did
so
it
abated
fear
is
a
worse
thing
than
danger
i
had
to
pass
very
nigh
the
pool
to
which
turkey
and
i
had
gone
the
night
of
our
adventure
with
bogbonny
s
bull
that
story
was
now
far
off
in
the
past
but
i
did
not
relish
the
dull
shine
of
the
water
in
the
hollow
notwithstanding
in
fact
i
owed
the
greater
part
of
the
courage
i
possessed
and
it
was
little
enough
for
my
needs
to
missy
i
dared
not
have
gone
on
my
own
two
legs
it
was
not
that
i
could
so
easily
run
away
with
four
instead
but
that
somehow
i
was
lifted
above
the
ordinary
level
of
fear
by
being
upon
her
back
i
think
many
men
draw
their
courage
out
of
their
horses
at
length
i
came
in
sight
of
the
keeper
s
farm
and
just
at
that
moment
the
moon
peeped
from
behind
a
hill
throwing
as
long
shadows
as
the
setting
sun
but
in
the
other
direction
the
shadows
were
very
different
too
somehow
they
were
liker
to
the
light
that
made
them
than
the
are
to
the
sunlight
both
the
light
and
the
shadows
of
the
moon
were
strange
and
fearful
to
me
the
sunlight
and
its
shadows
are
all
so
strong
and
so
real
and
so
friendly
you
seem
to
know
all
about
them
they
belong
to
your
house
and
they
sweep
all
fear
and
dismay
out
of
honest
people
s
hearts
but
with
the
moon
and
its
shadows
it
is
very
different
indeed
the
fact
is
the
moon
is
trying
to
do
what
she
can
not
do
she
is
trying
to
dispel
a
great
for
the
night
is
just
the
gathering
into
one
mass
of
all
the
shadows
of
the
sun
she
is
not
able
for
this
for
her
light
is
not
her
own
it
is
from
the
sun
himself
and
her
shadows
therefore
also
are
shadows
pieces
cut
out
of
the
great
and
coloured
a
little
with
the
moon
s
yellowness
if
i
were
writing
for
grown
people
i
should
tell
them
that
those
who
understand
things
because
they
think
about
them
and
ask
god
to
teach
them
walk
in
the
sunlight
and
others
who
take
things
because
other
people
tell
them
so
are
always
walking
in
the
strange
moonlight
and
are
subject
to
no
end
of
stumbles
and
terrors
for
they
hardly
know
light
from
darkness
well
at
first
the
moon
frightened
me
a
little
she
looked
so
knowing
and
yet
all
she
said
round
about
me
was
so
strange
but
i
rode
quietly
up
to
the
back
of
the
yard
where
the
ricks
stood
got
off
missy
and
fastened
the
bridle
to
the
gate
and
walked
across
to
the
where
the
moon
was
shining
upon
the
ladder
leading
up
to
the
loft
i
climbed
the
ladder
and
after
several
failures
succeeded
in
finding
how
the
door
was
fastened
when
i
opened
it
the
moonlight
got
in
before
me
and
poured
all
at
once
upon
a
heap
of
straw
in
the
farthest
corner
where
jamie
was
lying
asleep
with
a
rug
over
him
i
crossed
the
floor
knelt
down
by
him
and
tried
to
wake
him
this
was
not
so
easy
he
was
far
too
sound
asleep
to
be
troubled
by
the
rats
for
sleep
is
an
armour
yes
a
castle
against
many
enemies
i
got
hold
of
one
of
his
hands
and
in
lifting
it
to
pull
him
up
found
a
cord
tied
to
his
wrist
i
was
indignant
they
had
actually
manacled
him
like
a
thief
i
gave
the
cord
a
great
tug
of
anger
pulled
out
my
knife
and
cut
it
then
hauling
jamie
up
got
him
at
last
he
stared
with
fright
first
and
then
began
to
cry
as
soon
as
he
was
awake
enough
to
know
me
he
stopped
crying
but
not
staring
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
have
nothing
better
than
moonlight
in
them
come
along
jamie
i
said
i
m
come
to
take
you
i
don
t
want
to
go
home
said
jamie
i
want
to
go
to
sleep
that
s
very
ungrateful
of
you
jamie
i
said
full
of
my
own
importance
when
i
ve
come
so
far
and
all
at
night
too
to
set
you
i
m
free
enough
said
jamie
i
had
a
better
supper
a
great
deal
than
i
should
have
had
at
home
i
don
t
want
to
go
before
the
and
he
began
to
whimper
again
do
you
call
this
free
i
said
holding
up
his
wrist
where
the
remnant
of
the
cord
was
hanging
oh
said
jamie
that
s
only
but
ere
he
got
farther
the
moonlight
in
the
loft
was
darkened
i
looked
hurriedly
towards
the
door
there
stood
the
strangest
figure
with
the
moon
behind
it
i
thought
at
first
it
was
the
kelpie
come
after
me
for
it
was
a
tall
woman
my
heart
gave
a
great
jump
up
but
i
swallowed
it
down
i
would
not
disgrace
myself
before
jamie
it
was
not
the
kelpie
however
but
the
keeper
s
sister
the
great
grim
gaunt
woman
i
had
seen
at
the
table
at
supper
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
her
appearance
it
was
peculiar
enough
for
she
had
just
got
out
of
bed
and
thrown
an
old
shawl
about
her
she
was
not
pleasant
to
look
at
i
had
myself
raised
the
apparition
for
as
jamie
explained
to
me
afterwards
the
cord
which
was
tied
to
his
wrist
instead
of
being
meant
to
keep
him
a
prisoner
was
a
device
of
her
kindness
to
keep
him
from
being
too
frightened
the
other
end
had
been
tied
to
her
wrist
that
if
anything
happened
he
might
pull
her
and
then
she
would
come
to
him
illustration
what
s
the
matter
jamie
duff
she
said
in
a
gruff
voice
as
she
advanced
along
the
stream
of
moonlight
i
stood
up
as
bravely
as
i
could
it
s
only
me
miss
adam
i
said
and
who
are
you
she
returned
ranald
bannerman
i
answered
oh
she
said
in
a
puzzled
tone
what
are
you
doing
here
at
this
time
of
the
night
i
came
to
take
jamie
home
but
he
won
t
you
re
a
silly
boy
to
think
my
brother
john
would
do
him
any
harm
she
returned
you
re
comfortable
enough
aren
t
you
jamie
duff
yes
thank
you
ma
am
quite
comfortable
said
jamie
who
was
now
but
please
ma
am
ranald
didn
t
mean
any
he
s
a
housebreaker
though
she
rejoined
with
a
grim
chuckle
and
he
d
better
go
home
again
as
fast
as
he
can
if
john
adam
should
come
out
i
don
t
exactly
know
what
might
happen
or
perhaps
he
d
like
to
stop
and
keep
you
no
thank
you
miss
adam
i
said
i
will
go
come
along
then
and
let
me
shut
the
door
after
somewhat
nettled
with
jamie
duff
s
indifference
to
my
exertions
on
his
behalf
i
followed
her
without
even
bidding
him
good
night
oh
you
ve
got
missy
have
you
she
said
spying
her
where
she
stood
would
you
like
a
drink
of
milk
or
a
piece
of
oatcake
before
you
go
no
thank
you
i
said
i
shall
be
glad
to
go
to
i
should
think
so
she
answered
jamie
is
quite
comfortable
i
assure
you
and
i
ll
take
care
he
s
in
time
for
school
in
the
morning
there
s
no
harm
in
poor
thing
she
undid
the
bridle
for
me
helped
me
to
mount
in
the
kindest
way
bade
me
good
night
and
stood
looking
after
me
till
i
was
some
distance
off
i
went
home
at
a
good
gallop
took
off
the
saddle
and
bridle
and
laid
them
in
a
cart
in
the
shed
turned
missy
loose
into
the
stable
shut
the
door
and
ran
across
the
field
to
the
manse
desiring
nothing
but
bed
when
i
came
near
the
house
from
the
back
i
saw
a
figure
entering
the
gate
from
the
front
it
was
in
the
full
light
of
the
moon
which
was
now
up
a
good
way
before
it
had
reached
the
door
i
had
got
behind
the
next
corner
and
peeping
round
saw
that
my
first
impression
was
correct
it
was
the
kelpie
she
entered
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
very
softly
afraid
of
being
locked
out
a
danger
which
had
scarcely
occurred
to
me
before
i
hastened
after
her
but
finding
the
door
already
fast
i
called
through
the
keyhole
she
gave
a
cry
of
alarm
but
presently
opened
the
door
looking
pale
and
frightened
what
are
you
doing
out
of
doors
this
time
of
the
night
she
asked
but
without
quite
her
usual
arrogance
for
although
she
tried
to
put
it
on
her
voice
trembled
too
much
i
retorted
the
question
what
were
you
doing
out
yourself
i
said
looking
after
you
of
that
s
why
you
locked
the
door
i
suppose
to
keep
me
she
had
no
answer
ready
but
looked
as
if
she
would
have
struck
me
i
shall
let
your
father
know
of
your
goings
on
she
said
recovering
herself
a
little
you
need
not
take
the
trouble
i
shall
tell
him
myself
at
breakfast
morning
i
have
nothing
to
hide
you
had
better
tell
him
i
said
this
not
that
i
did
not
believe
she
had
been
out
to
look
for
me
but
because
i
thought
she
had
locked
the
door
to
annoy
me
and
i
wanted
to
take
my
revenge
in
rudeness
for
doors
were
seldom
locked
in
the
summer
nights
in
that
part
of
the
country
she
made
me
no
reply
but
turned
and
left
me
not
even
shutting
the
door
i
closed
it
and
went
to
bed
weary
enough
chapter
xxv
turkey
plots
the
next
day
at
breakfast
i
told
my
father
all
the
previous
day
s
adventures
never
since
he
had
so
kindly
rescued
me
from
the
misery
of
wickedness
had
i
concealed
anything
from
him
he
on
his
part
while
he
gave
us
every
freedom
expected
us
to
speak
frankly
concerning
our
doings
to
have
been
unwilling
to
let
him
know
any
of
our
proceedings
would
have
simply
argued
that
they
were
already
disapproved
of
by
ourselves
and
no
second
instance
of
this
had
yet
occurred
with
me
hence
it
came
that
still
as
i
grew
older
i
seemed
to
come
nearer
to
my
father
he
was
to
us
like
a
wiser
and
more
beautiful
self
over
us
a
more
enlightened
conscience
as
it
were
ever
lifting
us
up
towards
its
own
higher
level
this
was
sunday
but
he
was
not
so
strict
in
his
ideas
concerning
the
day
as
most
of
his
parishioners
so
long
as
we
were
sedate
and
orderly
and
neither
talked
nor
laughed
too
loud
he
seldom
interfered
with
our
behaviour
or
sought
to
alter
the
current
of
our
conversation
i
believe
he
did
not
like
some
people
require
or
expect
us
to
care
about
religious
things
as
much
as
he
did
we
could
not
yet
know
as
he
did
what
they
really
were
but
when
any
of
the
doings
of
the
week
were
referred
to
on
the
sunday
he
was
more
strict
i
think
than
on
other
days
in
bringing
them
if
they
involved
the
smallest
question
to
the
standard
of
right
to
be
judged
and
approved
or
condemned
thereby
i
believe
he
thought
that
to
order
our
ways
was
our
best
preparation
for
receiving
higher
instruction
afterwards
for
one
thing
we
should
then
upon
failure
feel
the
burden
of
it
the
more
and
be
the
more
ready
to
repent
and
seek
the
forgiveness
of
god
and
that
best
help
of
his
which
at
length
makes
a
man
good
within
himself
he
listened
attentively
to
my
story
seemed
puzzled
at
the
cry
i
had
heard
from
the
cottage
said
nothing
could
have
gone
very
wrong
or
we
should
have
heard
of
it
especially
as
andrew
had
been
to
inquire
laughed
over
the
apparition
of
miss
adam
and
my
failure
in
rescuing
jamie
duff
he
said
however
that
i
had
no
right
to
interefere
with
constituted
authority
that
adam
was
put
there
to
protect
the
trees
and
if
he
had
got
hold
of
a
harmless
person
yet
jamie
was
certainly
trespassing
and
i
ought
to
have
been
satisfied
with
turkey
s
way
of
looking
at
the
matter
i
saw
that
my
father
was
right
and
a
little
further
reflection
convinced
me
that
although
my
conduct
had
a
root
in
my
regard
for
jamie
duff
it
had
a
deeper
root
in
my
regard
for
his
sister
and
one
yet
deeper
in
my
regard
for
myself
for
had
i
not
longed
to
show
off
in
her
eyes
i
suspect
almost
all
silly
actions
have
their
root
in
selfishness
whether
it
take
the
form
of
vanity
of
conceit
of
greed
or
of
ambition
while
i
was
telling
my
tale
mitchell
kept
coming
into
the
room
oftener
and
lingering
longer
than
usual
i
did
not
think
of
this
till
afterwards
i
said
nothing
about
her
for
i
saw
no
occasion
but
i
do
not
doubt
she
was
afraid
i
would
and
wished
to
be
at
hand
to
defend
herself
she
was
a
little
more
friendly
to
me
in
church
that
day
she
always
sat
beside
little
davie
when
we
came
out
i
saw
andrew
and
hurried
after
him
to
hear
how
he
had
sped
the
night
before
he
told
me
he
had
found
all
perfectly
quiet
at
the
cottage
except
the
old
woman
s
cough
which
was
troublesome
and
gave
proof
that
she
was
alive
and
probably
as
well
as
usual
he
suggested
now
that
the
noise
was
all
a
fancy
of
mine
at
which
i
was
duly
indignant
and
desired
to
know
if
it
was
also
missy
s
fancy
that
made
her
go
off
like
a
mad
creature
he
then
returned
to
his
former
idea
of
the
cock
and
as
this
did
not
insult
my
dignity
i
let
it
pass
leaning
however
myself
to
the
notion
of
wandering
willie
s
pipes
illustration
on
the
following
wednesday
we
had
a
half
holiday
and
before
dinner
i
went
to
find
turkey
at
the
farm
he
met
me
in
the
yard
and
took
me
into
the
barn
i
want
to
speak
to
you
ranald
he
said
i
remember
so
well
how
the
barn
looked
that
day
the
upper
half
of
one
of
the
doors
had
a
hole
in
it
and
a
long
pencil
of
sunlight
streamed
in
and
fell
like
a
pool
of
glory
upon
a
heap
of
yellow
straw
so
golden
grew
the
straw
beneath
it
that
the
spot
looked
as
if
it
were
the
source
of
the
shine
and
sent
the
slanting
ray
up
and
out
of
the
hole
in
the
door
we
sat
down
beside
it
i
wondering
why
turkey
looked
so
serious
and
important
for
it
was
not
his
wont
ranald
said
turkey
i
can
t
bear
that
the
master
should
have
bad
people
about
what
do
you
mean
turkey
i
rejoined
i
mean
the
she
s
a
nasty
thing
i
know
i
answered
but
my
father
considers
her
a
faithful
that
s
just
where
it
is
she
is
not
faithful
i
ve
suspected
her
for
a
long
time
she
s
so
rough
and
that
she
looks
honest
but
i
shall
be
able
to
show
her
up
yet
you
wouldn
t
call
it
honest
to
cheat
the
poor
would
you
i
should
think
not
but
what
do
you
mean
there
must
have
been
something
to
put
old
eppie
in
such
an
on
saturday
don
t
you
think
i
suppose
she
had
had
a
sting
from
the
kelpie
s
no
ranald
that
s
not
it
i
had
heard
whispers
going
about
and
last
saturday
after
we
came
home
from
john
adam
s
and
after
i
had
told
elsie
about
jamie
i
ran
up
the
street
to
old
eppie
you
would
have
got
nothing
out
of
her
for
she
would
not
have
liked
to
tell
you
but
she
told
me
all
about
what
a
creature
you
are
turkey
everybody
tells
you
no
ranald
i
don
t
think
i
am
such
a
gossip
as
that
but
when
you
have
a
chance
you
ought
to
set
right
whatever
you
can
right
s
the
only
thing
but
aren
t
you
afraid
they
ll
call
you
a
meddler
turkey
not
that
think
so
for
i
m
sure
if
you
do
anything
anybody
it
s
some
other
that
would
be
no
justification
if
i
wasn
t
in
the
right
said
turkey
but
if
i
am
i
m
willing
to
bear
any
blame
that
comes
of
it
and
i
wouldn
t
meddle
for
anybody
that
could
take
care
of
himself
but
neither
old
eppie
nor
your
father
can
do
that
the
one
s
too
poor
and
the
other
too
i
wondering
what
you
meant
by
saying
my
father
couldn
t
take
care
of
he
s
too
good
he
s
too
good
ranald
he
believes
in
everybody
wouldn
t
have
kept
that
kelpie
in
house
half
the
did
you
ever
say
anything
to
kirsty
about
her
i
did
once
but
she
told
me
to
mind
my
own
business
kirsty
snubs
me
because
i
laugh
at
her
stories
but
kirsty
is
as
good
as
gold
and
i
wouldn
t
mind
if
she
boxed
my
ears
as
indeed
she
s
done
many
s
the
but
what
s
the
kelpie
been
doing
to
old
eppie
first
of
all
eppie
has
been
playing
her
a
then
she
mustn
t
eppie
s
was
a
lawful
trick
though
the
old
women
have
been
laying
their
old
heads
together
but
to
begin
at
the
beginning
there
has
been
for
some
time
a
growing
conviction
amongst
the
poor
folk
that
the
kelpie
never
gives
them
an
honest
handful
of
meal
when
they
go
their
rounds
but
this
was
very
hard
to
prove
and
although
they
all
suspected
it
few
of
them
were
absolutely
certain
about
it
so
they
resolved
that
some
of
them
should
go
with
empty
bags
every
one
of
those
found
a
full
handful
at
the
bottom
still
they
were
not
satisfied
they
said
she
was
the
one
to
take
care
what
she
was
about
thereupon
old
eppie
resolved
to
go
with
something
at
the
bottom
of
her
bag
to
look
like
a
good
quantity
of
meal
already
gathered
the
moment
the
door
was
closed
behind
her
that
was
last
saturday
she
peeped
into
the
bag
not
one
grain
of
meal
was
to
be
discovered
that
was
why
she
passed
you
muttering
to
herself
and
looking
so
angry
now
it
will
never
do
that
the
manse
of
all
places
should
be
the
one
where
the
poor
people
are
cheated
of
their
dues
but
we
roust
have
yet
better
proof
than
this
before
we
can
say
well
what
do
you
mean
to
do
turkey
i
asked
why
does
she
do
it
do
you
suppose
it
s
not
for
the
sake
of
saving
my
father
s
meal
i
should
no
she
does
something
with
it
and
i
suppose
flatters
herself
she
is
not
stealing
only
saving
it
off
the
poor
and
so
making
a
right
to
it
for
herself
i
can
t
help
thinking
that
her
being
out
that
same
night
had
something
to
do
with
it
did
you
ever
know
her
go
to
see
old
betty
no
she
doesn
t
like
her
i
know
i
m
not
so
sure
she
pretends
perhaps
but
we
ll
have
a
try
i
think
i
can
outwit
her
she
s
fair
game
you
how
what
do
tell
me
turkey
i
cried
right
eagerly
not
i
will
tell
you
by
and
he
got
up
and
went
about
his
work
chapter
xxvi
old
john
jamieson
as
i
returned
to
the
house
i
met
my
father
well
ranald
what
are
you
about
he
said
in
his
usual
gentle
tone
nothing
in
particular
father
i
answered
well
i
m
going
to
see
an
old
man
john
jamieson
i
don
t
think
you
know
him
he
has
not
been
able
to
come
to
church
for
a
long
time
they
tell
me
he
is
dying
would
you
like
to
go
with
me
yes
father
but
won
t
you
take
missy
not
if
you
will
walk
with
me
it
s
only
about
three
very
well
father
i
should
like
to
go
with
my
father
talked
about
various
things
on
the
way
i
remember
in
particular
some
remarks
he
made
about
reading
virgil
for
i
had
just
begun
the
æneid
for
one
thing
he
told
me
i
must
scan
every
line
until
i
could
make
it
sound
like
poetry
else
i
should
neither
enjoy
it
properly
nor
be
fair
to
the
author
then
he
repeated
some
lines
from
milton
saying
them
first
just
as
if
they
were
prose
and
after
that
the
same
lines
as
they
ought
to
be
sounded
making
me
mark
the
difference
next
he
did
the
same
with
a
few
of
the
opening
lines
of
virgil
s
great
poem
and
made
me
feel
the
difference
there
the
sound
is
the
shape
of
it
you
know
ranald
he
said
for
a
poem
is
all
for
the
ear
and
not
for
the
eye
the
eye
sees
only
the
sense
of
it
the
ear
sees
the
shape
of
it
to
judge
poetry
without
heeding
the
sound
of
it
is
nearly
as
bad
as
to
judge
a
rose
by
smelling
it
with
your
eyes
shut
the
sound
besides
being
a
beautiful
thing
in
itself
has
a
sense
in
it
which
helps
the
other
out
a
psalm
tune
if
it
s
the
right
one
helps
you
to
see
how
beautiful
the
psalm
is
every
poem
carries
its
own
tune
in
its
own
heart
and
to
read
it
aloud
is
the
only
way
to
bring
out
its
i
liked
virgil
ever
so
much
better
after
this
and
always
tried
to
get
at
the
tune
of
it
and
of
every
other
poem
i
read
the
right
way
of
anything
said
my
father
may
be
called
the
tune
of
it
we
have
to
find
out
the
tune
of
our
own
lives
some
people
don
t
seem
ever
to
find
it
out
and
so
their
lives
are
a
broken
and
uncomfortable
thing
to
them
full
of
ups
and
downs
and
disappointments
and
never
going
as
it
was
meant
to
but
what
is
the
right
tune
of
a
body
s
life
father
the
will
of
god
my
but
how
is
a
person
to
know
that
father
by
trying
to
do
what
he
knows
of
it
already
everybody
has
a
different
kind
of
tune
in
his
life
and
no
one
can
find
out
another
s
tune
for
him
though
he
help
him
to
find
it
for
but
aren
t
we
to
read
the
bible
father
yes
if
it
s
in
order
to
obey
it
to
read
the
bible
thinking
to
please
god
by
the
mere
reading
of
it
is
to
think
like
a
and
aren
t
we
to
say
our
prayers
father
we
are
to
ask
god
for
what
we
want
if
we
don
t
want
a
thing
we
are
only
acting
like
pagans
to
speak
as
if
we
did
and
call
it
prayer
and
think
we
are
pleasing
i
was
silent
my
father
resumed
i
fancy
the
old
man
we
are
going
to
see
found
out
the
tune
of
life
long
is
he
a
very
wise
man
then
father
that
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
should
call
him
a
wise
man
for
to
find
out
that
tune
is
the
truest
wisdom
but
he
s
not
a
learned
man
at
all
i
doubt
if
he
ever
read
a
book
but
the
bible
except
perhaps
the
pilgrim
s
progress
i
believe
he
has
always
been
very
fond
of
that
like
that
don
t
you
ranald
i
ve
read
it
a
good
many
times
father
but
i
was
a
little
tired
of
it
before
i
got
through
it
last
but
you
did
read
it
through
did
you
the
last
time
i
mean
oh
yes
father
i
never
like
to
leave
the
loose
end
of
a
thing
hanging
that
s
right
my
boy
that
s
right
well
i
think
you
d
better
not
open
the
book
again
for
a
long
time
say
twenty
years
at
least
it
s
a
great
deal
too
good
a
book
to
let
yourself
get
tired
of
by
that
time
i
trust
you
will
be
able
to
understand
it
a
great
deal
better
than
you
can
at
i
felt
a
little
sorry
that
i
was
not
to
look
at
the
pilgrim
s
progress
for
twenty
years
but
i
am
very
glad
of
it
now
we
must
not
spoil
good
books
by
reading
them
too
much
my
father
added
it
is
often
better
to
think
about
them
than
to
read
them
and
it
is
best
never
to
do
either
when
we
are
tired
of
them
we
should
get
tired
of
the
sunlight
itself
beautiful
as
it
is
if
god
did
not
send
it
away
every
night
we
re
not
even
fit
to
have
moonlight
always
the
moon
is
buried
in
the
darkness
every
month
and
because
we
can
bear
nothing
for
any
length
of
time
together
we
are
sent
to
sleep
every
night
that
we
may
begin
fresh
again
in
the
i
see
father
i
see
i
answered
we
talked
on
until
we
came
in
sight
of
john
jamieson
s
cottage
what
a
poor
little
place
it
was
to
look
at
built
of
clay
which
had
hardened
in
the
sun
till
it
was
just
one
brick
but
it
was
a
better
place
to
live
in
than
it
looked
for
no
wind
could
come
through
the
walls
although
there
was
plenty
of
wind
about
three
little
windows
looked
eastward
to
the
rising
sun
and
one
to
the
south
it
had
no
more
it
stood
on
the
side
of
a
heathy
hill
which
rose
up
steep
behind
it
and
bending
round
sheltered
it
from
the
north
a
low
wall
of
loose
stones
enclosed
a
small
garden
reclaimed
from
the
hill
where
grew
some
greens
and
cabbages
and
potatoes
with
a
flower
here
and
there
between
in
summer
it
was
pleasant
enough
for
the
warm
sun
makes
any
place
pleasant
but
in
winter
it
must
have
been
a
cold
dreary
place
indeed
there
was
no
other
house
within
sight
of
it
a
little
brook
went
cantering
down
the
hill
close
to
the
end
of
the
cottage
singing
merrily
it
is
a
long
way
to
the
sea
but
by
its
very
nature
the
water
will
find
it
at
last
said
my
father
pointing
to
the
stream
as
we
crossed
it
by
the
single
stone
that
was
its
bridge
he
had
to
bend
his
head
low
to
enter
the
cottage
an
old
woman
the
sick
man
s
wife
rose
from
the
side
of
the
chimney
to
greet
us
my
father
asked
how
john
was
wearing
away
was
her
answer
but
he
ll
be
glad
to
see
we
turned
in
the
direction
in
which
her
eyes
guided
us
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
a
small
head
and
the
next
a
hand
large
and
bony
the
old
man
lay
in
a
bed
closed
in
with
boards
so
that
very
little
light
fell
upon
him
but
his
hair
glistened
silvery
through
the
gloom
my
father
drew
a
chair
beside
him
john
looked
up
and
seeing
who
it
was
feebly
held
out
his
hand
my
father
took
it
and
stroked
it
and
said
well
john
my
man
you
ve
had
a
hard
life
of
no
harder
than
i
could
bear
said
john
it
s
a
grand
thing
to
be
able
to
say
that
said
my
father
oh
sir
for
that
matter
i
would
go
through
it
all
again
if
it
was
will
and
willingly
i
have
no
will
but
his
well
john
i
wish
we
could
all
say
the
same
when
a
man
comes
to
that
the
lord
lets
him
have
what
he
wants
what
do
you
want
now
john
to
depart
and
be
with
the
lord
it
wouldn
t
be
true
sir
to
say
that
i
wasn
t
weary
it
seems
to
me
if
it
s
the
lord
s
will
i
ve
had
enough
of
this
life
even
if
death
be
a
long
sleep
as
some
people
say
till
the
judgment
i
think
i
would
rather
sleep
for
i
m
very
weary
only
there
s
the
old
woman
there
i
don
t
like
leaving
but
you
can
trust
god
for
her
too
can
t
you
it
would
be
a
poor
thing
if
i
couldn
t
were
you
ever
hungry
john
dreadfully
hungry
i
mean
never
longer
than
i
could
bear
he
answered
when
you
think
it
s
the
will
of
god
hunger
doesn
t
get
much
hold
of
you
you
must
excuse
me
john
for
asking
so
many
questions
you
know
god
better
than
i
do
and
i
want
my
young
man
here
to
know
how
strong
the
will
of
god
makes
a
man
old
or
young
he
needn
t
care
about
anything
else
need
he
there
s
nothing
else
to
care
about
sir
if
only
the
will
of
god
be
done
everything
s
all
right
you
know
i
do
believe
sir
god
cares
more
for
me
than
my
old
woman
herself
does
and
she
s
been
as
good
a
wife
to
me
as
ever
was
young
gentleman
you
know
who
says
that
god
numbers
the
very
hairs
of
our
heads
there
s
not
many
of
mine
left
to
number
he
added
with
a
faint
smile
but
there
s
plenty
of
yours
you
mind
the
will
of
god
and
he
ll
look
after
you
that
s
the
way
he
divides
the
business
of
i
saw
now
that
my
father
s
talk
as
we
came
had
been
with
a
view
to
prepare
me
for
what
john
jamieson
would
say
i
can
not
pretend
however
to
have
understood
the
old
man
at
the
time
but
his
words
have
often
come
back
to
me
since
and
helped
me
through
trials
pretty
severe
although
like
the
old
man
i
have
never
found
any
of
them
too
hard
to
bear
have
you
no
child
to
come
and
help
your
wife
to
wait
upon
you
my
father
asked
i
have
had
ten
sir
but
only
three
are
left
alive
there
ll
be
plenty
to
welcome
me
home
when
i
go
one
of
the
three
s
in
canada
and
can
t
come
another
s
in
australia
and
he
can
t
come
but
maggie
s
not
far
off
and
she
s
got
leave
from
her
mistress
to
come
for
a
week
only
we
don
t
want
her
to
come
till
i
m
nearer
my
end
i
should
like
her
to
see
the
last
of
her
old
father
for
i
shall
be
young
again
by
the
next
time
she
sees
me
please
god
sir
he
s
all
in
all
isn
t
he
sir
true
john
if
we
have
god
we
have
all
things
for
all
things
are
his
and
we
are
his
but
we
mustn
t
weary
you
too
much
thank
you
for
your
good
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
had
no
intention
of
speaking
like
that
i
never
could
give
advice
in
all
my
life
i
always
found
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
take
the
good
advice
that
was
given
to
me
i
should
like
to
be
prayed
for
in
the
church
next
sunday
sir
if
you
but
can
t
you
pray
for
yourself
john
yes
sir
but
i
would
like
to
have
some
spiritual
gift
because
my
friends
asked
it
for
me
let
them
pray
for
more
faith
for
me
i
want
more
and
more
of
that
the
more
you
have
the
more
you
want
don
t
you
sir
and
i
mightn
t
ask
enough
for
myself
now
i
m
so
old
and
so
tired
i
sleep
a
great
deal
then
don
t
you
think
god
will
take
care
to
give
you
enough
even
if
you
shouldn
t
ask
for
enough
said
my
father
no
doubt
of
that
but
you
see
i
am
able
to
think
of
it
now
and
so
i
must
put
things
in
a
train
for
the
time
when
i
shan
t
be
able
to
think
of
something
like
this
was
what
john
said
and
although
i
could
not
understand
it
then
my
father
spoke
to
me
several
times
about
it
afterwards
and
i
came
to
see
how
the
old
man
wanted
to
provide
against
the
evil
time
by
starting
prayers
heavenward
beforehand
as
it
were
my
father
prayed
by
his
bedside
pulled
a
parcel
or
two
from
his
pocket
for
his
wife
and
then
we
walked
home
together
in
silence
my
father
was
not
the
man
to
heap
words
upon
words
and
so
smother
the
thought
that
lay
in
them
he
had
taken
me
for
the
sake
of
the
lesson
i
might
receive
and
he
left
it
to
strike
root
in
my
mind
which
he
judged
more
likely
if
it
remained
undisturbed
chapter
xxvii
turkey
s
trick
when
we
came
to
the
farm
on
our
way
home
we
looked
in
to
see
kirsty
but
found
the
key
in
the
door
indicating
that
she
had
gone
out
as
we
left
the
yard
we
saw
a
woman
to
all
appearance
a
beggar
approaching
she
had
a
wallet
over
her
shoulder
and
walked
stooping
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
nor
lifted
them
to
greet
us
behaviour
which
rarely
showed
itself
in
our
parish
my
father
took
no
notice
but
i
could
not
help
turning
to
look
after
the
woman
to
my
surprise
she
stood
looking
after
us
but
the
moment
i
turned
she
turned
also
and
walked
on
when
i
looked
again
she
had
vanished
of
course
she
must
have
gone
into
the
not
liking
the
look
of
her
and
remembering
that
kirsty
was
out
i
asked
my
father
whether
i
had
not
better
see
if
any
of
the
men
were
about
the
stable
he
approved
and
i
ran
back
to
the
house
the
door
was
still
locked
i
called
turkey
and
heard
his
voice
in
reply
from
one
of
the
farthest
of
the
when
i
had
reached
it
and
told
him
my
story
he
asked
if
my
father
knew
i
had
come
back
when
he
heard
that
he
did
know
he
threw
down
his
pitchfork
and
hastened
with
me
we
searched
every
house
about
the
place
but
could
find
no
sign
whatever
of
the
woman
are
you
sure
it
wasn
t
all
a
fancy
of
your
own
ranald
said
turkey
quite
sure
ask
my
father
she
passed
as
near
us
as
you
are
to
me
turkey
hurried
away
to
search
the
hayloft
once
more
but
without
success
and
at
last
i
heard
my
father
calling
me
i
ran
to
him
and
told
him
there
was
no
woman
to
be
seen
that
s
odd
he
said
she
must
have
passed
straight
through
the
yard
and
got
out
at
the
other
side
before
you
went
in
while
you
were
looking
for
her
she
was
plodding
away
out
of
sight
come
along
and
let
us
have
our
i
could
not
feel
quite
satisfied
about
it
but
as
there
was
no
other
explanation
i
persuaded
myself
that
my
father
was
right
the
next
saturday
evening
i
was
in
the
nursery
with
my
brothers
it
was
growing
dusk
when
i
heard
a
knocking
mitchell
did
not
seem
to
hear
it
so
i
went
and
opened
the
door
there
was
the
same
beggar
woman
rather
frightened
i
called
aloud
and
mitchell
came
when
she
saw
it
was
a
beggar
she
went
back
and
reappeared
with
a
wooden
basin
filled
with
meal
from
which
she
took
a
handful
as
she
came
in
apparent
preparation
for
dropping
it
in
the
customary
way
into
the
woman
s
bag
the
woman
never
spoke
but
closed
the
mouth
of
her
wallet
and
turned
away
curiosity
gave
me
courage
to
follow
her
she
walked
with
long
strides
in
the
direction
of
the
farm
and
i
kept
at
a
little
distance
behind
her
she
made
for
the
yard
she
should
not
escape
me
this
time
as
soon
as
she
entered
it
i
ran
as
fast
as
i
could
and
just
caught
sight
of
her
back
as
she
went
into
one
of
the
i
darted
after
her
she
turned
round
upon
me
fiercely
i
thought
but
judge
my
surprise
when
she
held
out
the
open
mouth
of
the
bag
towards
me
and
said
not
one
grain
ranald
put
in
your
hand
and
it
was
turkey
i
stared
in
amazement
unable
for
a
time
to
get
rid
of
the
apparition
and
see
the
reality
turkey
burst
out
laughing
at
my
perplexed
countenance
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
before
turkey
i
asked
able
at
length
to
join
in
the
laugh
because
then
you
would
have
had
to
tell
your
father
and
i
did
not
want
him
to
be
troubled
about
it
at
least
before
we
had
got
things
clear
i
always
wonder
how
he
could
keep
such
a
creature
about
he
doesn
t
know
her
as
we
do
no
she
never
gives
him
the
chance
but
now
ranald
couldn
t
you
manage
to
find
out
whether
she
makes
any
store
of
the
meal
she
pretends
to
give
away
a
thought
struck
me
i
heard
davie
the
other
day
asking
her
why
she
had
two
perhaps
that
has
something
to
do
with
you
must
find
out
don
t
ask
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
kelpie
had
upon
that
night
of
terror
been
out
on
business
of
her
own
and
had
not
been
looking
for
me
at
all
then
she
was
down
at
old
betty
s
cottage
said
turkey
when
i
communicated
the
suspicion
and
wandering
willie
was
there
too
and
andrew
was
right
about
the
pipes
willie
hasn
t
been
once
to
the
house
ever
since
he
took
davie
but
she
has
gone
to
meet
him
at
betty
s
depend
on
it
ranald
he
s
her
brother
or
nephew
or
something
as
i
used
to
say
i
do
believe
she
gives
him
the
meal
to
take
home
to
her
family
somewhere
did
you
ever
hear
anything
about
her
friends
i
never
heard
her
speak
of
then
i
don
t
believe
they
re
respectable
i
don
t
ranald
but
it
will
be
a
great
trouble
to
the
minister
to
have
to
turn
her
away
i
wonder
if
we
couldn
t
contrive
to
make
her
go
of
herself
i
wish
we
could
scare
her
out
of
the
country
it
s
not
nice
either
for
a
woman
like
that
to
have
to
do
with
such
innocents
as
allister
and
she
s
very
fond
of
so
she
is
that
s
the
only
good
thing
i
know
of
her
but
hold
your
tongue
ranald
till
we
find
out
acting
on
the
hint
davie
had
given
me
i
soon
discovered
the
second
it
was
small
and
carefully
stowed
away
it
was
now
nearly
full
and
every
day
i
watched
in
the
hope
that
when
she
emptied
it
i
should
be
able
to
find
out
what
she
did
with
the
meal
but
turkey
s
suggestion
about
frightening
her
away
kept
working
in
my
brain
chapter
xxviii
i
scheme
too
i
began
a
series
of
persecutions
of
the
kelpie
on
my
own
account
i
was
doubtful
whether
turkey
would
approve
of
them
so
i
did
not
tell
him
for
some
time
but
i
was
ambitious
of
showing
him
that
i
could
do
something
without
him
i
doubt
whether
it
is
worth
while
to
relate
the
silly
tricks
i
played
her
my
father
made
me
sorry
enough
for
them
afterwards
my
only
excuse
for
them
is
that
i
hoped
by
them
to
drive
the
kelpie
away
there
was
a
closet
in
the
hall
the
floor
of
which
was
directly
over
the
kelpie
s
bed
with
no
ceiling
between
with
a
gimlet
i
bored
a
hole
in
the
floor
through
which
i
passed
a
piece
of
string
i
had
already
got
a
bit
of
black
cloth
and
sewed
and
stuffed
it
into
something
of
the
shape
of
a
rat
watching
an
opportunity
i
tied
this
to
the
end
of
the
string
by
the
head
and
hid
it
under
her
bolster
when
she
was
going
to
bed
i
went
into
the
closet
and
laying
my
mouth
to
the
floor
began
squeaking
like
a
rat
and
scratching
with
my
nails
knowing
by
the
exclamation
she
made
that
i
had
attracted
her
attention
i
tugged
at
the
string
this
lifted
the
bolster
a
little
and
of
course
out
came
my
rat
i
heard
her
scream
and
open
her
door
i
pulled
the
rat
up
tight
to
the
ceiling
then
the
door
of
the
nursery
where
we
slept
only
in
the
winter
opened
and
shut
and
i
concluded
she
had
gone
to
bed
there
to
avoid
the
rat
i
could
hardly
sleep
for
pleasure
at
my
success
as
she
waited
on
us
at
breakfast
next
morning
she
told
my
father
that
she
had
seen
in
her
bed
the
biggest
rat
she
ever
saw
in
her
life
and
had
not
had
a
wink
of
sleep
in
consequence
well
said
my
father
that
comes
of
not
liking
cats
you
should
get
a
pussy
to
take
care
of
she
grumbled
something
and
retired
she
removed
her
quarters
to
the
nursery
but
there
it
was
yet
easier
for
me
to
plague
her
having
observed
in
which
bed
she
lay
i
passed
the
string
with
the
rat
at
the
end
of
it
over
the
middle
of
a
bar
that
ran
across
just
above
her
head
then
took
the
string
along
the
top
of
the
other
bed
and
through
a
little
hole
in
the
door
as
soon
as
i
judged
her
safe
in
bed
i
dropped
the
rat
with
a
plump
it
must
have
fallen
on
or
very
near
her
face
i
heard
her
give
a
loud
cry
but
before
she
could
reach
the
door
i
had
fastened
the
string
to
a
nail
and
got
out
of
the
way
it
was
not
so
easy
in
those
days
to
get
a
light
for
the
earliest
form
of
lucifer
match
was
only
just
making
its
appearance
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
was
very
dear
she
had
to
go
to
the
kitchen
where
the
fire
never
went
out
summer
or
winter
afraid
lest
on
her
return
she
should
search
the
bed
find
my
harmless
animal
suspended
by
the
neck
and
descend
upon
me
with
all
the
wrath
generated
of
needless
terror
i
crept
into
the
room
got
down
my
rat
pulled
away
the
string
and
escaped
the
next
morning
she
said
nothing
about
the
rat
but
went
to
a
neighbour
s
and
brought
home
a
fine
cat
i
laughed
in
my
sleeve
thinking
how
little
her
cat
could
protect
her
from
my
rat
once
more
however
she
changed
her
quarters
and
went
into
a
sort
of
inferior
spare
room
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
which
suited
my
operations
still
better
for
from
my
own
bed
i
could
now
manage
to
drop
and
pull
up
the
rat
drawing
it
away
beyond
the
danger
of
discovery
the
next
night
she
took
the
cat
into
the
room
with
her
and
for
that
one
i
judged
it
prudent
to
leave
her
alone
but
the
next
having
secured
kirsty
s
cat
i
turned
him
into
the
room
after
she
was
in
bed
the
result
was
a
frightful
explosion
of
feline
wrath
i
now
thought
i
might
boast
of
my
successes
to
turkey
but
he
was
not
pleased
she
is
sure
to
find
you
out
ranald
he
said
and
then
whatever
else
we
do
will
be
a
failure
leave
her
alone
till
we
have
her
i
do
not
care
to
linger
over
this
part
of
my
story
i
am
a
little
ashamed
of
it
we
found
at
length
that
her
private
reservoir
was
quite
full
of
meal
i
kept
close
watch
still
and
finding
one
night
that
she
was
not
in
the
house
discovered
also
that
the
was
now
empty
i
ran
to
turkey
and
together
we
hurried
to
betty
s
cottage
it
was
a
cloudy
night
with
glimpses
of
moonlight
when
we
reached
the
place
we
heard
voices
talking
and
were
satisfied
that
both
the
kelpie
and
wandering
willie
were
there
we
must
wait
till
she
comes
out
said
turkey
we
must
be
able
to
say
we
saw
there
was
a
great
stone
standing
out
of
the
ground
not
far
from
the
door
just
opposite
the
and
the
path
lay
between
them
you
get
behind
that
tree
no
you
are
the
smaller
object
you
get
behind
that
stone
and
i
ll
get
behind
the
tree
said
turkey
and
when
the
kelpie
comes
out
you
make
a
noise
like
a
beast
and
rush
at
her
on
i
m
good
at
a
pig
turkey
i
said
will
a
pig
do
yes
well
but
what
if
she
should
know
me
and
catch
me
turkey
she
will
start
away
from
you
to
my
side
i
shall
rush
out
like
a
mad
dog
and
then
she
ll
run
for
we
waited
a
long
time
a
very
long
time
it
seemed
to
me
it
was
well
it
was
summer
we
talked
a
little
across
and
that
helped
to
beguile
the
weary
time
but
at
last
i
said
in
a
whisper
let
s
go
home
turkey
and
lock
the
doors
and
keep
her
you
go
home
then
ranald
and
i
ll
wait
i
don
t
mind
if
it
be
till
morning
it
is
not
enough
to
be
sure
ourselves
we
must
be
able
to
make
other
people
i
ll
wait
as
long
as
you
do
turkey
only
i
m
very
sleepy
and
she
might
come
out
when
i
was
oh
i
shall
keep
you
awake
replied
turkey
and
we
settled
down
again
for
a
while
at
the
long
last
the
latch
of
the
door
was
lifted
i
was
just
falling
asleep
but
the
sound
brought
me
wide
awake
at
once
i
peeped
from
behind
my
shelter
it
was
the
kelpie
with
an
empty
bag
a
i
believe
in
her
hand
behind
her
came
wandering
willie
but
did
not
follow
her
from
the
door
the
moment
was
favourable
for
the
moon
was
under
a
thick
cloud
just
as
she
reached
the
stone
i
rushed
out
on
hands
and
knees
grunting
and
squeaking
like
a
very
wild
pig
indeed
as
turkey
had
foretold
she
darted
aside
and
i
retreated
behind
my
stone
the
same
instant
turkey
rushed
at
her
with
such
canine
fury
that
the
imitation
startled
even
me
who
had
expected
it
you
would
have
thought
the
animal
was
ready
to
tear
a
whole
army
to
pieces
with
such
a
complication
of
fierce
growls
and
barks
and
squeals
did
he
dart
on
the
unfortunate
culprit
she
took
to
her
heels
at
once
not
daring
to
make
for
the
cottage
because
the
enemy
was
behind
her
but
i
had
hardly
ensconced
myself
behind
the
stone
repressing
my
laughter
with
all
my
might
when
i
was
seized
from
behind
by
wandering
willie
who
had
no
fear
either
of
pig
or
dog
he
began
pommelling
me
illustration
turkey
turkey
i
cried
the
cry
stopped
his
barking
pursuit
of
the
kelpie
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
rushed
to
my
aid
but
when
he
saw
the
state
of
affairs
he
turned
at
once
for
the
cottage
crying
now
for
a
kick
at
the
bagpipes
wandering
willie
was
not
too
much
a
fool
to
remember
and
understand
he
left
me
instantly
and
made
for
the
cottage
turkey
drew
back
and
let
him
enter
then
closed
the
door
and
held
it
get
away
a
bit
ranald
i
can
run
faster
than
willie
you
ll
be
out
of
sight
in
a
few
but
instead
of
coming
after
us
wandering
willie
began
playing
a
most
triumphant
tune
upon
his
darling
bagpipes
how
the
poor
old
woman
enjoyed
it
i
do
not
know
perhaps
she
liked
it
for
us
we
set
off
to
outstrip
the
kelpie
it
did
not
matter
to
turkey
but
she
might
lock
me
out
again
i
was
almost
in
bed
before
i
heard
her
come
in
she
went
straight
to
her
own
room
chapter
xxix
a
double
exposure
whether
the
kelpie
had
recognized
us
i
could
not
tell
but
not
much
of
the
next
morning
passed
before
my
doubt
was
over
when
she
had
set
our
porridge
on
the
table
she
stood
up
and
with
her
fists
in
her
sides
addressed
my
father
i
m
very
sorry
sir
to
have
to
make
complaints
it
s
a
thing
i
don
t
like
and
i
m
not
given
to
i
m
sure
i
try
to
do
my
duty
by
master
ranald
as
well
as
everyone
else
in
this
i
felt
a
little
confused
for
i
now
saw
clearly
enough
that
my
father
could
not
approve
of
our
proceedings
i
whispered
to
allister
run
and
fetch
turkey
tell
him
to
come
allister
always
did
whatever
i
asked
him
he
set
off
at
once
the
kelpie
looked
suspicious
as
he
left
the
room
but
she
had
no
pretext
for
interference
i
allowed
her
to
tell
her
tale
without
interruption
after
relating
exactly
how
we
had
served
her
the
night
before
when
she
had
gone
on
a
visit
of
mercy
as
she
represented
it
she
accused
me
of
all
my
former
tricks
that
of
the
cat
having
i
presume
enlightened
her
as
to
the
others
and
ended
by
saying
that
if
she
were
not
protected
against
me
and
turkey
she
must
leave
the
place
let
her
go
father
i
said
none
of
us
like
i
like
her
whimpered
little
davie
silence
sir
said
my
father
very
sternly
are
these
things
true
yes
father
i
answered
but
please
hear
what
ve
got
to
say
she
s
only
told
you
side
of
you
have
confessed
to
the
truth
of
what
she
alleges
said
my
father
i
did
think
he
went
on
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
though
a
good
deal
in
both
that
you
had
turned
from
your
bad
ways
to
think
of
my
taking
you
with
me
to
the
of
a
holy
man
and
then
finding
you
so
soon
after
playing
such
tricks
more
like
the
mischievousness
of
a
monkey
than
of
a
human
being
i
don
t
say
it
was
right
father
and
i
m
very
sorry
if
i
have
offended
you
offended
me
and
very
deeply
you
have
been
unkind
and
indeed
cruel
to
a
good
woman
who
has
done
her
best
for
you
for
many
years
i
was
not
too
much
abashed
to
take
notice
that
the
kelpie
bridled
at
this
i
can
t
say
i
m
sorry
for
what
i
ve
done
to
her
i
said
really
ranald
you
are
impertinent
i
would
send
you
out
of
the
room
at
once
but
you
must
beg
mitchell
s
pardon
first
and
after
that
there
will
be
something
more
to
say
i
but
father
you
have
not
heard
my
story
well
go
on
it
is
fair
i
suppose
to
hear
both
sides
but
nothing
can
justify
such
i
began
with
trembling
voice
i
had
gone
over
in
my
mind
the
night
before
all
i
would
say
knowing
it
better
to
tell
the
tale
from
the
beginning
circumstantially
before
i
had
ended
turkey
made
his
appearance
ushered
in
by
allister
both
were
out
of
breath
with
running
my
father
stopped
me
and
ordered
turkey
away
until
i
should
have
finished
i
ventured
to
look
up
at
the
kelpie
once
or
twice
she
had
grown
white
and
grew
whiter
when
turkey
left
the
room
she
would
have
gone
too
but
my
father
told
her
she
must
stay
and
hear
me
to
the
end
several
times
she
broke
out
accusing
me
of
telling
a
pack
of
wicked
lies
but
my
father
told
her
she
should
have
an
opportunity
of
defending
herself
and
she
must
not
interrupt
me
when
i
had
done
he
called
turkey
and
made
him
tell
the
story
i
need
hardly
say
that
although
he
questioned
us
closely
he
found
no
discrepancy
between
our
accounts
he
turned
at
last
to
mitchell
who
but
for
her
rage
would
have
been
in
an
abject
condition
now
mitchell
he
said
she
had
nothing
to
reply
beyond
asserting
that
turkey
and
i
had
always
hated
and
persecuted
her
and
had
now
told
a
pack
of
lies
which
we
had
agreed
upon
to
ruin
her
a
poor
lone
woman
with
no
friends
to
take
her
part
i
do
not
think
it
likely
they
could
be
so
wicked
said
my
father
so
i
m
to
be
the
only
wicked
person
in
the
world
very
well
sir
i
will
leave
the
house
this
very
no
no
mitchell
that
won
t
do
one
party
or
the
other
very
wicked
that
is
clear
and
it
is
of
the
greatest
consequence
to
me
to
find
out
which
if
you
go
i
shall
know
it
is
you
and
have
you
taken
up
and
tried
for
stealing
meantime
i
shall
go
the
round
of
the
parish
i
do
not
think
all
the
poor
people
will
have
combined
to
lie
against
they
all
hate
me
said
the
kelpie
and
why
asked
my
father
she
made
no
answer
i
must
get
at
the
truth
of
it
said
my
father
you
can
go
she
left
the
room
without
another
word
and
my
father
turned
to
turkey
i
am
surprised
at
you
turkey
lending
yourself
to
such
silly
pranks
why
did
you
not
come
and
tell
i
am
very
sorry
sir
i
was
afraid
you
would
be
troubled
at
finding
how
wicked
she
was
and
i
thought
we
might
frighten
her
away
somehow
but
ranald
began
his
tricks
without
letting
me
know
and
then
i
saw
that
mine
could
be
of
no
use
for
she
would
suspect
them
after
his
mine
would
have
been
better
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
but
equally
unjustifiable
and
you
as
well
as
he
acted
the
part
of
a
animal
last
i
confess
i
yielded
to
temptation
then
for
i
knew
it
could
do
no
good
it
was
all
for
the
pleasure
of
frightening
her
it
was
very
foolish
of
me
and
i
beg
your
pardon
well
turkey
i
confess
you
have
vexed
me
not
by
trying
to
find
out
the
wrong
she
was
doing
me
and
the
whole
parish
but
by
taking
the
whole
thing
into
your
own
hands
it
is
worse
of
you
inasmuch
as
you
are
older
and
far
wiser
than
ranald
it
is
worse
of
ranald
because
i
was
his
father
i
will
try
to
show
you
the
wrong
you
have
had
you
told
me
without
doing
anything
yourselves
then
i
might
have
succeeded
in
bringing
mitchell
to
repentance
i
could
have
reasoned
with
her
on
the
matter
and
shown
her
that
she
was
not
merely
a
thief
but
a
thief
of
the
worst
kind
a
judas
who
robbed
the
poor
and
so
robbed
god
i
could
have
shown
her
how
cruel
she
was
please
sir
interrupted
turkey
i
don
t
think
after
all
she
did
it
for
herself
i
do
believe
he
went
on
and
my
father
listened
that
wandering
willie
is
some
relation
of
hers
he
is
the
only
poor
person
almost
the
only
person
except
davie
i
ever
saw
her
behave
kindly
to
he
was
there
last
night
and
also
i
fancy
that
other
time
when
ranald
got
such
a
fright
she
has
poor
relations
somewhere
and
sends
the
meal
to
them
by
willie
you
remember
sir
there
were
no
old
clothes
of
allister
s
to
be
found
when
you
wanted
them
for
jamie
you
may
be
right
turkey
i
dare
say
you
are
right
i
hope
you
are
for
though
bad
enough
that
would
not
be
quite
so
bad
as
doing
it
for
i
am
very
sorry
father
i
said
i
beg
your
i
hope
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
my
boy
after
what
you
have
done
rousing
every
bad
and
angry
passion
in
her
i
fear
it
will
be
of
no
use
to
try
to
make
her
be
sorry
and
repent
it
is
to
her
not
to
me
you
have
done
the
wrong
i
have
nothing
to
complain
of
for
myself
quite
the
contrary
but
it
is
a
very
dreadful
thing
to
throw
difficulties
in
the
way
of
repentance
and
turning
from
evil
what
can
i
do
to
make
up
for
it
i
sobbed
i
don
t
see
at
this
moment
what
you
can
do
i
will
turn
it
over
in
my
mind
you
may
go
thereupon
turkey
and
i
walked
away
i
to
school
he
to
his
cattle
the
lecture
my
father
had
given
us
was
not
to
be
forgotten
turkey
looked
sad
and
i
felt
subdued
and
concerned
everything
my
father
heard
confirmed
the
tale
we
had
told
him
but
the
kelpie
frustrated
whatever
he
may
have
resolved
upon
with
regard
to
her
before
he
returned
she
had
disappeared
how
she
managed
to
get
her
chest
away
i
can
not
tell
i
think
she
must
have
hid
it
in
some
outhouse
and
fetched
it
the
next
night
many
little
things
were
missed
from
the
house
afterwards
but
nothing
of
great
value
and
neither
she
nor
wandering
willie
ever
appeared
again
we
were
all
satisfied
that
poor
old
betty
knew
nothing
of
her
conduct
it
was
easy
enough
to
deceive
her
for
she
was
alone
in
her
cottage
only
waited
upon
by
a
neighbour
who
visited
her
at
certain
times
of
the
day
my
father
i
heard
afterwards
gave
five
shillings
out
of
his
own
pocket
to
every
one
of
the
poor
people
whom
the
kelpie
had
defrauded
her
place
in
the
house
was
to
our
endless
happiness
taken
by
kirsty
and
faithfully
she
carried
out
my
father
s
instructions
that
along
with
the
sacred
handful
of
meal
a
penny
should
be
given
to
every
one
of
the
parish
poor
from
that
time
forward
so
long
as
he
lived
at
the
manse
not
even
little
davie
cried
when
he
found
that
mitchell
was
really
gone
it
was
more
his
own
affection
than
her
kindness
that
had
attached
him
to
her
thus
were
we
at
last
delivered
from
our
kelpie
chapter
xxx
tribulation
illustration
after
the
expulsion
of
the
kelpie
and
the
accession
of
kirsty
things
went
on
so
peaceably
that
the
whole
time
rests
in
my
memory
like
a
summer
evening
after
sundown
i
have
therefore
little
more
to
say
concerning
our
there
were
two
schools
in
the
little
town
the
first
the
parish
school
the
master
of
which
was
appointed
by
the
presbytery
the
second
one
chiefly
upheld
by
the
dissenters
of
the
place
the
master
of
which
was
appointed
by
the
parents
of
the
scholars
this
difference
however
indicated
very
little
of
the
distinction
and
separation
which
it
would
have
involved
in
england
the
masters
of
both
were
licentiates
of
the
established
church
an
order
having
a
vague
resemblance
to
that
of
deacons
in
the
english
church
there
were
at
both
of
them
scholars
whose
fees
were
paid
by
the
parish
while
others
at
both
were
preparing
for
the
university
there
were
many
pupils
at
the
second
school
whose
parents
took
them
to
the
established
church
on
sundays
and
both
were
yearly
examined
by
the
presbytery
that
is
the
clergymen
of
a
certain
district
while
my
father
was
on
friendly
terms
with
all
the
parents
some
of
whom
did
not
come
to
his
church
because
they
thought
the
expenses
of
religion
should
be
met
by
the
offerings
of
those
who
prized
its
ministrations
while
others
regarded
the
unity
of
the
nation
and
thought
that
religion
like
any
other
of
its
necessities
ought
to
be
the
care
of
its
chosen
government
i
do
not
think
the
second
school
would
ever
have
come
into
existence
at
all
except
for
the
requirements
of
the
population
one
school
being
insufficient
there
was
little
real
schism
in
the
matter
except
between
the
boys
themselves
they
made
far
more
of
it
than
their
parents
and
an
occasional
outbreak
was
the
consequence
at
this
time
there
was
at
the
second
school
a
certain
very
rough
lad
the
least
developed
beyond
the
brute
perhaps
of
all
the
scholars
of
the
village
it
is
more
amazing
to
see
how
close
to
the
brute
a
man
may
remain
than
it
is
to
see
how
far
he
may
leave
the
brute
behind
how
it
began
i
can
not
recall
but
this
youth
a
lad
of
seventeen
whether
moved
by
dislike
or
the
mere
fascination
of
injury
was
in
the
habit
of
teasing
me
beyond
the
verge
of
endurance
as
often
as
he
had
the
chance
i
did
not
like
to
complain
to
my
father
though
that
would
have
been
better
than
to
hate
him
as
i
did
i
was
ashamed
of
my
own
impotence
for
but
therein
i
was
little
to
blame
for
i
was
not
more
than
half
his
size
and
certainly
had
not
half
his
strength
my
pride
forbidding
flight
the
probability
was
when
we
met
in
an
quarter
that
he
would
block
my
path
for
half
an
hour
at
least
pull
my
hair
pinch
my
cheeks
and
do
everything
to
annoy
me
short
of
leaving
marks
of
violence
upon
me
if
we
met
in
a
street
or
other
people
were
in
sight
he
would
pass
me
with
a
wink
and
a
grin
as
much
as
to
say
one
of
the
short
but
fierce
wars
between
the
rival
schools
broke
out
what
originated
the
individual
quarrel
i
can
not
tell
i
doubt
if
anyone
knew
it
had
not
endured
a
day
however
before
it
came
to
a
pitched
battle
after
school
hours
the
second
school
was
considerably
the
smaller
but
it
had
the
advantage
of
being
perched
on
the
top
of
the
low
steep
hill
at
the
bottom
of
which
lay
ours
our
battles
always
began
with
missiles
and
i
wonder
as
often
as
i
recall
the
fact
that
so
few
serious
accidents
were
the
consequence
from
the
disadvantages
of
the
ground
we
had
little
chance
against
the
which
descended
upon
us
like
hail
except
we
charged
right
up
the
hill
in
the
face
of
the
inferior
but
enemy
when
this
was
not
in
favour
at
the
moment
i
employed
myself
in
collecting
stones
and
supplying
them
to
my
companions
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
every
boy
down
to
the
smallest
in
either
school
was
skilful
in
throwing
them
except
myself
i
could
not
throw
halfway
up
the
hill
on
this
occasion
however
i
began
to
fancy
it
an
unworthy
exercise
of
my
fighting
powers
and
made
my
first
attempt
at
organizing
a
troop
for
an
charge
i
was
now
a
tall
boy
and
of
some
influence
amongst
those
about
my
own
age
whether
the
enemy
saw
our
intent
and
proceeded
to
forestall
it
i
can
not
say
but
certainly
that
charge
never
took
place
a
house
of
some
importance
was
then
building
just
on
the
top
of
the
hill
and
a
sort
of
or
lorry
on
low
wheels
was
in
use
for
moving
the
large
stones
employed
the
chips
from
the
dressing
of
which
were
then
for
us
most
formidable
missiles
our
adversaries
laid
hold
of
this
chariot
and
turned
it
into
an
engine
of
war
they
dragged
it
to
the
top
of
the
hill
jumped
upon
it
as
many
as
it
would
hold
and
drawn
by
their
own
weight
came
thundering
down
upon
our
troops
vain
was
the
storm
of
stones
which
assailed
their
advance
they
could
not
have
stopped
if
they
would
my
company
had
to
open
and
make
way
for
the
advancing
prodigy
conspicuous
upon
which
towered
my
personal
enemy
scroggie
now
i
called
to
my
men
as
soon
as
the
thing
stops
rush
in
and
seize
them
they
re
not
half
our
number
it
will
be
an
endless
disgrace
to
let
them
whether
we
should
have
had
the
courage
to
carry
out
the
design
had
not
fortune
favoured
us
i
can
not
tell
but
as
soon
as
the
chariot
reached
a
part
of
the
hill
where
the
slope
was
less
it
turned
a
little
to
one
side
and
scroggie
fell
off
drawing
half
of
the
load
after
him
my
men
rushed
in
with
shouts
of
defiant
onset
but
were
arrested
by
the
of
the
foe
i
sprung
to
seize
scroggie
he
tried
to
get
up
but
fell
back
with
a
groan
the
moment
i
saw
his
face
my
mood
changed
my
hatred
without
will
or
wish
or
effort
of
mine
turned
all
at
once
into
pity
or
something
better
in
a
moment
i
was
down
on
my
knees
beside
him
his
face
was
white
and
drops
stood
upon
his
forehead
he
lay
half
upon
his
side
and
with
one
hand
he
scooped
handfuls
of
dirt
from
the
road
and
threw
them
down
again
his
leg
was
broken
i
got
him
to
lean
his
head
against
me
and
tried
to
make
him
lie
more
comfortably
but
the
moment
i
sought
to
move
the
leg
he
shrieked
out
i
sent
one
of
our
swiftest
runners
for
the
doctor
and
in
the
meantime
did
the
best
i
could
for
him
he
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
and
did
not
even
thank
me
when
the
doctor
came
we
got
a
mattress
from
a
neighbouring
house
laid
it
on
the
wagon
lifted
scroggie
on
the
top
and
dragged
him
up
the
hill
and
home
to
his
mother
i
have
said
a
little
but
only
a
little
concerning
our
master
wilson
at
the
last
examination
i
had
in
compliance
with
the
request
of
one
of
the
clergymen
read
aloud
a
metrical
composition
of
my
own
sent
in
by
way
of
essay
on
the
given
subject
and
after
this
he
had
shown
me
a
great
increase
of
favour
perhaps
he
recognized
in
me
some
germ
of
a
literary
faculty
i
can
not
tell
it
has
never
come
to
much
if
he
did
and
he
must
be
greatly
disappointed
in
me
seeing
i
labour
not
in
living
words
but
in
dead
stones
i
am
certain
though
that
whether
i
build
good
or
bad
houses
i
should
have
built
worse
had
i
not
had
the
insight
he
gave
me
into
literature
and
the
nature
of
literary
utterance
i
read
virgil
and
horace
with
him
and
scanned
every
doubtful
line
we
came
across
i
sometimes
think
now
that
what
certain
successful
men
want
to
make
them
real
artists
is
simply
a
knowledge
of
the
literature
which
is
the
essence
of
the
possible
art
of
the
country
my
brother
tom
had
left
the
school
and
gone
to
the
county
town
to
receive
some
final
preparation
for
the
university
consequently
so
far
as
the
school
was
concerned
i
was
no
longer
in
the
position
of
a
younger
brother
also
wilson
had
discovered
that
i
had
some
faculty
for
imparting
what
knowledge
i
possessed
and
had
begun
to
make
use
of
me
in
teaching
the
others
a
good
deal
was
done
in
this
way
in
the
scotch
schools
not
that
there
was
the
least
attempt
at
system
in
it
the
master
at
any
moment
would
choose
the
one
he
thought
fit
and
set
him
to
teach
a
class
while
he
attended
to
individuals
or
taught
another
class
himself
nothing
can
be
better
for
the
verification
of
knowledge
or
for
the
discovery
of
ignorance
than
the
attempt
to
teach
in
my
case
it
led
to
other
and
unforeseen
results
as
well
the
increasing
trust
the
master
reposed
in
me
and
the
increasing
favour
which
openly
accompanied
it
so
stimulated
the
growth
of
my
natural
vanity
that
at
length
it
appeared
in
the
form
of
presumption
and
i
have
little
doubt
although
i
was
unaware
of
it
at
the
time
influenced
my
whole
behaviour
to
my
hence
arose
the
complaint
that
i
was
a
favourite
with
the
master
and
the
accusation
that
i
used
underhand
means
to
recommend
myself
to
him
of
which
i
am
not
yet
aware
that
i
was
ever
guilty
my
presumption
i
confess
and
wonder
that
the
master
did
not
take
earlier
measures
to
check
it
when
teaching
a
class
i
would
not
unfrequently
if
wilson
had
vacated
his
chair
climb
into
it
and
sit
there
as
if
i
were
the
master
of
the
school
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
deposit
some
of
my
books
in
the
master
s
desk
instead
of
in
my
own
recess
but
i
had
not
the
least
suspicion
of
the
indignation
i
was
thus
rousing
against
me
one
afternoon
i
had
a
class
of
history
they
read
very
badly
with
what
seemed
wilful
blundering
but
when
it
came
to
the
questioning
on
the
subject
of
the
lesson
i
soon
saw
there
had
been
a
conspiracy
the
answers
they
gave
were
invariably
wrong
generally
absurd
sometimes
utterly
grotesque
i
ought
to
except
those
of
a
few
girls
who
did
their
best
and
apparently
knew
nothing
of
the
design
of
the
others
one
or
two
girls
however
infected
with
the
spirit
of
the
game
soon
outdid
the
whole
class
in
the
wildness
of
their
replies
this
at
last
got
the
better
of
me
i
lost
my
temper
threw
down
my
book
and
retired
to
my
seat
leaving
the
class
where
it
stood
the
master
called
me
and
asked
the
reason
i
told
him
the
truth
of
the
matter
he
got
very
angry
and
called
out
several
of
the
bigger
boys
and
punished
them
severely
whether
these
supposed
that
i
had
mentioned
them
in
particular
as
i
had
not
i
do
not
know
but
i
could
read
in
their
faces
that
they
vowed
vengeance
in
their
hearts
when
the
school
broke
up
i
lingered
to
the
last
in
the
hope
they
would
all
go
home
as
usual
but
when
i
came
out
with
the
master
and
saw
the
silent
waiting
groups
it
was
evident
there
was
more
thunder
in
the
moral
atmosphere
than
would
admit
of
easy
discharge
the
master
had
come
to
the
same
conclusion
for
instead
of
turning
towards
his
own
house
he
walked
with
me
part
of
the
way
home
without
alluding
however
to
the
reason
allister
was
with
us
and
i
led
davie
by
the
hand
it
was
his
first
week
of
school
life
when
we
had
got
about
half
the
distance
believing
me
now
quite
safe
he
turned
into
a
footpath
and
went
through
the
fields
back
towards
the
town
while
we
delivered
from
all
immediate
apprehension
jogged
homewards
when
we
had
gone
some
distance
farther
i
happened
to
look
about
why
i
could
not
tell
a
crowd
was
following
us
at
full
speed
as
soon
as
they
saw
that
we
had
discovered
them
they
broke
the
silence
with
a
shout
which
was
followed
by
the
patter
of
their
many
footsteps
run
allister
i
cried
and
kneeling
i
caught
up
davie
on
my
back
and
ran
with
the
feet
of
fear
burdened
thus
allister
was
soon
far
ahead
of
me
bring
turkey
i
cried
after
him
run
to
the
farm
as
hard
as
you
can
pelt
and
bring
turkey
to
meet
yes
yes
ranald
shouted
allister
and
ran
yet
faster
they
were
not
getting
up
with
us
quite
so
fast
as
they
wished
they
began
therefore
to
pick
up
stones
as
they
ran
and
we
soon
heard
them
hailing
on
the
road
behind
us
a
little
farther
and
the
stones
began
to
go
bounding
past
us
so
that
i
dared
no
longer
carry
davie
on
my
back
i
had
to
stop
which
lost
us
time
and
to
shift
him
into
my
arms
which
made
running
much
harder
davie
kept
calling
run
ranald
here
they
come
and
jumping
so
half
in
fear
half
in
pleasure
that
i
found
it
very
hard
work
indeed
their
taunting
voices
reached
me
at
length
loaded
with
all
sorts
of
taunting
and
opprobrious
words
some
of
them
i
dare
say
deserved
but
not
all
next
a
stone
struck
me
but
not
in
a
dangerous
place
though
it
crippled
my
running
still
more
the
bridge
was
now
in
sight
however
and
there
i
could
get
rid
of
davie
and
turn
at
bay
for
it
was
a
small
wooden
bridge
with
rails
and
a
narrow
gate
at
the
end
to
keep
horsemen
from
riding
over
it
the
foremost
of
our
pursuers
were
within
a
few
yards
of
my
heels
when
with
a
last
effort
i
bounded
on
it
and
i
had
just
time
to
set
davie
down
and
turn
and
bar
their
way
by
shutting
the
gate
before
they
reached
it
i
had
no
breath
left
but
just
enough
to
cry
run
davie
davie
however
had
no
notion
of
the
state
of
affairs
and
did
not
run
but
stood
behind
me
staring
so
i
was
not
much
better
off
yet
if
he
had
only
run
and
i
had
seen
him
far
enough
on
the
way
home
i
would
have
taken
to
the
water
which
was
here
pretty
deep
before
i
would
have
run
any
further
risk
of
their
getting
hold
of
me
if
i
could
have
reached
the
mill
on
the
opposite
bank
a
shout
would
have
brought
the
miller
to
my
aid
but
so
long
as
i
could
prevent
them
from
opening
the
gate
i
thought
i
could
hold
the
position
there
was
only
a
latch
to
secure
it
but
i
pulled
a
thin
knife
from
my
pocket
and
just
as
i
received
a
blow
in
the
face
from
the
first
arrival
which
knocked
me
backwards
i
had
jammed
it
over
the
latch
through
the
iron
staple
in
which
it
worked
before
the
first
attempt
to
open
it
had
been
followed
by
the
discovery
of
the
obstacle
i
was
up
and
the
next
moment
with
a
kick
disabled
a
few
of
the
fingers
which
were
fumbling
to
remove
it
to
protect
the
latch
was
now
my
main
object
but
my
efforts
would
have
been
quite
useless
for
twenty
of
them
would
have
been
over
the
top
in
an
instant
help
however
although
unrecognized
as
such
was
making
its
way
through
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
they
parted
asunder
and
scroggie
still
lame
strode
heavily
up
to
the
gate
recalling
nothing
but
his
old
enmity
i
turned
once
more
and
implored
davie
do
run
davie
dear
it
s
all
up
i
said
but
my
entreaties
were
lost
upon
davie
turning
again
in
despair
i
saw
the
lame
leg
being
hoisted
over
the
gate
a
shudder
ran
through
me
i
could
kick
that
leg
but
i
sprang
up
and
hit
scroggie
hard
in
the
face
i
might
as
well
have
hit
a
block
of
granite
he
swore
at
me
caught
hold
of
my
hand
and
turning
to
the
assailants
said
now
you
be
off
this
is
my
little
business
i
ll
do
for
him
although
they
were
far
enough
from
obeying
his
orders
they
were
not
willing
to
turn
him
into
an
enemy
and
so
hung
back
expectant
meantime
the
lame
leg
was
on
one
side
of
the
gate
the
splints
of
which
were
sharpened
at
the
points
and
the
sound
leg
was
upon
the
other
i
on
the
one
side
for
he
had
let
go
my
hand
in
order
to
support
himself
retreated
a
little
and
stood
upon
the
defensive
trembling
i
must
confess
while
my
enemies
on
the
other
side
could
not
reach
me
so
long
as
scroggie
was
upon
the
top
of
the
gate
the
lame
leg
went
searching
gently
about
but
could
find
no
rest
for
the
sole
of
its
foot
for
there
was
no
projecting
cross
bar
upon
this
side
the
repose
upon
the
top
was
anything
but
perfect
and
the
leg
suspended
behind
was
useless
the
long
and
the
short
both
in
legs
and
results
was
that
there
scroggie
stuck
and
so
long
as
he
stuck
i
was
safe
as
soon
as
i
saw
this
i
turned
and
caught
up
davie
thinking
to
make
for
home
once
more
but
that
very
instant
there
was
a
rush
at
the
gate
scroggie
was
hoisted
over
the
knife
was
taken
out
and
on
poured
the
assailants
before
i
had
quite
reached
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
at
them
oscar
cried
a
voice
the
dog
rushed
past
me
on
to
the
bridge
followed
by
turkey
i
set
davie
down
and
holding
his
hand
breathed
again
there
was
a
scurry
and
a
rush
a
splash
or
two
in
the
water
and
then
back
came
oscar
with
his
innocent
tongue
hanging
out
like
a
banner
of
victory
he
was
followed
by
scroggie
who
was
exploding
with
laughter
illustration
oscar
came
up
wagging
his
tail
and
looking
as
pleased
as
if
he
had
restored
obedience
to
a
flock
of
unruly
sheep
i
shrank
back
from
scroggie
wishing
turkey
who
was
still
at
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
would
make
haste
wasn
t
it
fun
ranald
said
scroggie
you
don
t
think
i
was
so
lame
that
i
couldn
t
get
over
that
gate
i
stuck
on
turkey
joined
us
with
an
inquiring
look
for
he
knew
how
scroggie
had
been
in
the
habit
of
treating
me
it
s
all
right
turkey
i
said
scroggie
stuck
on
the
gate
on
a
good
thing
for
you
ranald
said
turkey
didn
t
you
see
peter
mason
amongst
them
no
he
left
the
school
last
he
was
there
though
and
i
don
t
suppose
meant
to
be
i
tell
you
what
said
scroggie
if
you
like
i
ll
leave
my
school
and
come
to
yours
my
mother
lets
me
do
as
i
i
thanked
him
but
said
i
did
not
think
there
would
be
more
of
it
it
would
blow
over
allister
told
my
father
as
much
as
he
knew
of
the
affair
and
when
he
questioned
me
i
told
him
as
much
as
i
knew
the
next
morning
just
as
we
were
all
settling
to
work
my
father
entered
the
school
the
hush
that
followed
was
intense
the
place
might
have
been
absolutely
empty
for
any
sound
i
could
hear
for
some
seconds
the
ringleaders
of
my
enemies
held
down
their
heads
as
anticipating
an
outbreak
of
vengeance
but
after
a
few
moments
conversation
with
wilson
my
father
departed
there
was
a
mystery
about
the
proceeding
an
unknown
possibility
of
result
which
had
a
very
sedative
effect
the
whole
of
the
morning
when
we
broke
up
for
dinner
wilson
detained
me
and
told
me
that
my
father
thought
it
better
that
for
some
time
at
least
i
should
not
occupy
such
a
prominent
position
as
before
he
was
very
sorry
he
said
for
i
had
been
a
great
help
to
him
and
if
i
did
not
object
he
would
ask
my
father
to
allow
me
to
assist
him
in
the
during
the
winter
i
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
sank
back
into
my
natural
position
and
met
with
no
more
annoyance
after
a
while
i
was
able
to
assure
my
former
foes
that
i
had
had
no
voice
in
bringing
punishment
upon
them
in
particular
and
the
enmity
was
i
believe
quite
extinguished
when
winter
came
and
the
was
opened
wilson
called
at
the
manse
and
my
father
very
willingly
assented
to
the
proposed
arrangement
the
scholars
were
mostly
young
men
from
neighbouring
farms
or
from
workshops
in
the
village
with
whom
although
i
was
so
much
younger
than
they
there
was
no
danger
of
jealousy
the
additional
assistance
they
would
thus
receive
and
their
respect
for
superior
knowledge
in
which
with
my
advantages
i
had
no
credit
over
them
would
prevent
any
false
shame
because
of
my
inferiority
in
years
there
were
a
few
girls
at
the
school
as
well
among
the
rest
elsie
duff
although
her
grandmother
was
very
feeble
elsie
was
now
able
to
have
a
little
more
of
her
own
way
and
there
was
no
real
reason
why
the
old
woman
should
not
be
left
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
evening
i
need
hardly
say
that
turkey
was
a
regular
attendant
he
always
and
i
often
saw
elsie
home
my
chief
pleasure
lay
in
helping
her
with
her
lessons
i
did
my
best
to
assist
all
who
wanted
my
aid
but
offered
unsolicited
attention
to
her
she
was
not
quick
but
would
never
be
satisfied
until
she
understood
and
that
is
more
than
any
superiority
of
gifts
hence
if
her
progress
was
slow
it
was
unintermitting
turkey
was
far
before
me
in
trigonometry
but
i
was
able
to
help
him
in
grammar
and
geography
and
when
he
commenced
latin
which
he
did
the
same
winter
i
assisted
him
a
good
deal
sometimes
wilson
would
ask
me
to
go
home
with
him
after
school
and
take
supper
this
made
me
late
but
my
father
did
not
mind
it
for
he
liked
me
to
be
with
wilson
i
learned
a
good
deal
from
him
at
such
times
he
had
an
excellent
little
library
and
would
take
down
his
favourite
books
and
read
me
passages
it
is
wonderful
how
things
which
in
reading
for
ourselves
we
might
pass
over
in
a
manner
gain
their
true
power
and
influence
through
the
voice
of
one
who
sees
and
feels
what
is
in
them
if
a
man
in
whom
you
have
confidence
merely
lays
his
finger
on
a
paragraph
and
says
to
you
read
that
you
will
probably
discover
three
times
as
much
in
it
as
you
would
if
you
had
only
chanced
upon
it
in
the
course
of
your
reading
in
such
case
the
mind
gathers
itself
up
and
is
all
eyes
and
ears
but
wilson
would
sometimes
read
me
a
few
verses
of
his
own
and
this
was
a
delight
such
as
i
have
rarely
experienced
my
reader
may
wonder
that
a
man
and
a
good
scholar
should
condescend
to
treat
a
boy
like
me
as
so
much
of
an
equal
but
sympathy
is
precious
even
from
a
child
and
wilson
had
no
companions
of
his
own
standing
i
believe
he
read
more
to
turkey
than
to
me
however
as
i
have
once
apologized
already
for
the
introduction
of
a
few
of
his
verses
with
scotch
words
in
them
i
will
venture
to
try
whether
the
same
apology
will
not
cover
a
second
offence
of
the
same
sort
jeanie
braw
i

chapter
xxxi
a
winter
s
ride
in
this
winter
the
stormiest
i
can
recollect
occurred
the
chief
adventure
of
my
boyhood
indeed
the
event
most
worthy
to
be
called
an
adventure
i
have
ever
encountered
there
had
been
a
tremendous
fall
of
snow
which
a
furious
wind
lasting
two
days
and
the
night
between
had
drifted
into
great
mounds
so
that
the
shape
of
the
country
was
much
altered
with
new
heights
and
hollows
even
those
who
were
best
acquainted
with
them
could
only
guess
at
the
direction
of
some
of
the
roads
and
it
was
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
lose
the
right
track
even
in
broad
daylight
as
soon
as
the
storm
was
over
however
and
the
frost
was
found
likely
to
continue
they
had
begun
to
cut
passages
through
some
of
the
deeper
wreaths
as
they
called
the
while
over
the
tops
of
others
and
along
the
general
line
of
the
more
frequented
roads
footpaths
were
soon
trodden
it
was
many
days
however
before
vehicles
could
pass
and
be
resumed
between
the
towns
all
the
short
day
the
sun
though
low
was
brilliant
and
the
whole
country
shone
with
dazzling
whiteness
but
after
sunset
which
took
place
between
three
and
four
o
clock
anything
more
dreary
can
hardly
be
imagined
especially
when
the
keenest
of
winds
rushed
in
gusts
from
the
and
lifting
the
from
untrodden
shadows
blew
it
like
so
many
stings
in
the
face
of
the
freezing
traveller
early
one
afternoon
just
as
i
came
home
from
school
which
in
winter
was
always
over
at
three
o
clock
my
father
received
a
message
that
a
certain
laird
or
as
he
would
be
called
in
england
whose
house
lay
three
or
four
miles
off
amongst
the
hills
was
at
the
point
of
death
and
very
anxious
to
see
him
a
groom
on
horseback
had
brought
the
message
the
old
man
had
led
a
life
of
indifferent
repute
and
that
probably
made
him
the
more
anxious
to
see
my
father
who
proceeded
at
once
to
get
ready
for
the
uninviting
journey
since
my
brother
tom
s
departure
i
had
become
yet
more
of
a
companion
to
my
father
and
now
when
i
saw
him
preparing
to
set
out
i
begged
to
be
allowed
to
go
with
him
his
little
black
mare
had
a
daughter
not
unused
to
the
saddle
she
was
almost
twice
her
mother
s
size
and
none
the
less
clumsy
that
she
was
chiefly
employed
upon
the
farm
still
she
had
a
touch
of
the
roadster
in
her
and
if
not
capable
of
elegant
motion
could
get
over
the
ground
well
enough
with
a
sort
of
speedy
slouch
while
as
was
of
far
more
consequence
on
an
expedition
like
the
present
she
was
of
great
strength
and
could
go
through
the
wreaths
andrew
said
like
a
iron
my
father
hesitated
looked
out
at
the
sky
and
hesitated
still
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
ranald
if
i
were
sure
of
the
weather
but
i
am
very
doubtful
however
if
it
should
break
up
we
can
stay
there
all
night
here
allister
run
and
tell
andrew
to
saddle
both
the
mares
and
bring
them
down
make
haste
with
your
dinner
delighted
at
the
prospect
i
did
make
haste
the
meal
was
soon
over
and
kirsty
expended
her
utmost
care
in
clothing
me
for
the
journey
which
would
certainly
be
a
much
longer
one
in
regard
of
time
than
of
space
in
half
an
hour
we
were
all
mounted
and
on
our
way
the
groom
who
had
so
lately
traversed
the
road
a
few
yards
in
front
i
have
already
said
perhaps
more
than
once
that
my
father
took
comparatively
little
notice
of
us
as
children
beyond
teaching
us
of
a
sunday
and
sometimes
of
a
in
winter
generally
after
we
were
in
bed
he
rarely
fondled
us
or
did
anything
to
supply
in
that
manner
the
loss
of
our
mother
i
believe
his
thoughts
were
tenderness
itself
towards
us
but
they
did
not
show
themselves
in
ordinary
shape
some
connecting
link
was
absent
it
seems
to
me
now
sometimes
that
perhaps
he
was
wisely
retentive
of
his
feelings
and
waited
a
better
time
to
let
them
flow
for
ever
as
we
grew
older
we
drew
nearer
to
my
father
or
more
properly
my
father
drew
us
nearer
to
him
dropping
by
degrees
that
reticence
which
perhaps
too
many
parents
of
character
keep
up
until
their
children
are
full
grown
and
by
this
time
he
would
converse
with
me
most
freely
i
presume
he
had
found
or
believed
he
had
found
me
trustworthy
and
incapable
of
repeating
unwisely
any
remarks
he
made
but
much
as
he
hated
certain
kinds
of
gossip
he
believed
that
indifference
to
your
neighbour
and
his
affairs
was
worse
he
said
everything
depended
on
the
spirit
in
which
men
spoke
of
each
other
that
much
of
what
was
called
gossip
was
only
a
natural
love
of
biography
and
if
kindly
was
better
than
blameless
that
the
greater
part
of
it
was
objectionable
simply
because
it
was
not
loving
only
curious
while
a
portion
was
amongst
the
wickedest
things
on
earth
because
it
had
for
its
object
to
believe
and
make
others
believe
the
worst
i
mention
these
opinions
of
my
father
lest
anyone
should
misjudge
the
fact
of
his
talking
to
me
as
he
did
our
horses
made
very
slow
progress
it
was
almost
nowhere
possible
to
trot
and
we
had
to
plod
on
step
by
step
this
made
it
more
easy
to
converse
the
country
looks
dreary
doesn
t
it
ranald
he
said
just
like
as
if
everything
was
dead
father
i
replied
if
the
sun
were
to
cease
shining
altogether
what
do
you
think
would
happen
illustration
i
thought
a
bit
but
was
not
prepared
to
answer
when
my
father
spoke
again
what
makes
the
seeds
grow
ranald
the
oats
and
the
wheat
and
the
barley
the
rain
father
i
said
with
well
if
there
were
no
sun
the
vapours
would
not
rise
to
make
clouds
what
rain
there
was
already
in
the
sky
would
come
down
in
snow
or
lumps
of
ice
the
earth
would
grow
colder
and
colder
and
harder
and
harder
until
at
last
it
went
sweeping
through
the
air
one
frozen
mass
as
hard
as
stone
without
a
green
leaf
or
a
living
creature
upon
how
dreadful
to
think
of
father
i
said
that
would
be
yes
my
boy
it
is
the
sun
that
is
the
life
of
the
world
not
only
does
he
make
the
rain
rise
to
fall
on
the
seeds
in
the
earth
but
even
that
would
be
useless
if
he
did
not
make
them
warm
as
well
and
do
something
else
to
them
besides
which
we
can
not
understand
farther
down
into
the
earth
than
any
of
the
rays
of
light
can
reach
he
sends
other
rays
we
can
not
see
which
go
searching
about
in
it
like
long
fingers
and
wherever
they
find
and
touch
a
seed
the
life
that
is
in
that
seed
begins
to
talk
to
itself
as
it
were
and
straightway
begins
to
grow
out
of
the
dark
earth
he
thus
brings
all
the
lovely
green
things
of
the
spring
and
clothes
the
world
with
beauty
and
sets
the
waters
running
and
the
birds
singing
and
the
lambs
bleating
and
the
children
gathering
daisies
and
and
the
gladness
overflowing
in
all
hearts
very
different
from
what
we
see
now
isn
t
it
ranald
yes
father
a
body
can
hardly
believe
to
look
at
it
now
that
the
world
will
ever
be
like
that
but
for
as
cold
and
wretched
as
it
looks
the
sun
has
not
forsaken
it
he
has
only
drawn
away
from
it
a
little
for
good
reasons
one
of
which
is
that
we
may
learn
that
we
can
not
do
without
him
if
he
were
to
go
not
one
breath
more
could
one
of
us
draw
horses
and
men
we
should
drop
down
frozen
lumps
as
hard
as
stones
who
is
the
sun
s
father
ranald
he
hasn
t
got
a
father
i
replied
hoping
for
some
answer
as
to
a
riddle
yes
he
has
ranald
i
can
prove
that
you
remember
whom
the
apostle
james
calls
the
father
of
lights
oh
yes
of
course
father
but
doesn
t
that
mean
another
kind
of
lights
yes
but
they
couldn
t
be
called
lights
if
they
were
not
like
the
sun
all
kinds
of
lights
must
come
from
the
father
of
lights
now
the
father
of
the
sun
must
be
like
the
sun
and
indeed
of
all
material
things
the
sun
is
likest
to
god
we
pray
to
god
to
shine
upon
us
and
give
us
light
if
god
did
not
shine
into
our
hearts
they
would
be
dead
lumps
of
cold
we
shouldn
t
care
for
anything
then
father
god
never
stops
shining
upon
us
he
wouldn
t
be
like
the
sun
if
he
did
for
even
in
winter
the
sun
shines
enough
to
keep
us
true
my
boy
i
am
very
glad
you
understand
me
in
all
my
experience
i
have
never
yet
known
a
man
in
whose
heart
i
could
not
find
proofs
of
the
shining
of
the
great
sun
it
might
be
a
very
feeble
wintry
shine
but
still
he
was
there
for
a
human
heart
though
it
is
very
dreadful
to
have
a
cold
white
winter
like
this
inside
it
instead
of
a
summer
of
colour
and
warmth
and
light
there
s
the
poor
old
man
we
are
going
to
see
they
talk
of
the
winter
of
age
that
s
all
very
well
but
the
heart
is
not
made
for
winter
a
man
may
have
the
snow
on
his
roof
and
merry
children
about
his
hearth
he
may
have
grey
hairs
on
his
head
and
the
very
gladness
of
summer
in
his
bosom
but
this
old
man
i
am
afraid
feels
wintry
cold
then
why
doesn
t
the
father
of
lights
shine
more
on
him
and
make
him
warmer
the
sun
is
shining
as
much
on
the
earth
in
the
winter
as
in
the
summer
why
is
the
earth
no
warmer
because
i
answered
calling
up
what
little
astronomy
i
knew
that
part
of
it
is
turned
away
from
the
just
so
then
if
a
man
turns
himself
away
from
the
father
of
lights
the
great
sun
how
can
he
be
warmed
but
the
earth
can
t
help
it
but
the
man
can
ranald
he
feels
the
cold
and
he
knows
he
can
turn
to
the
light
even
this
poor
old
man
knows
it
now
god
is
shining
on
him
a
wintry
way
or
he
would
not
feel
the
cold
at
all
he
would
be
only
a
lump
of
ice
a
part
of
the
very
winter
itself
the
good
of
what
warmth
god
gives
him
is
that
he
feels
cold
if
he
were
all
cold
he
couldn
t
feel
does
he
want
to
turn
to
the
sun
then
father
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
that
he
is
miserable
because
he
has
not
turned
to
the
what
will
you
say
to
him
father
i
can
not
tell
my
boy
it
depends
on
what
i
find
him
thinking
of
all
things
my
boy
keep
your
face
to
the
sun
you
can
t
shine
of
yourself
you
can
t
be
good
of
yourself
but
god
has
made
you
able
to
turn
to
the
sun
whence
all
goodness
and
all
shining
comes
god
s
children
may
be
very
naughty
but
they
must
be
able
to
turn
towards
him
the
father
of
lights
is
the
father
of
every
weakest
little
baby
of
a
good
thought
in
us
as
well
as
of
the
highest
devotion
of
martyrdom
if
you
turn
your
face
to
the
sun
my
boy
your
soul
will
when
you
come
to
die
feel
like
an
autumn
with
the
golden
fruits
of
the
earth
hanging
in
rich
clusters
ready
to
be
gathered
not
like
a
winter
you
may
feel
ever
so
worn
but
you
will
not
feel
withered
you
will
die
in
peace
hoping
for
the
spring
and
such
a
spring
thus
talking
in
the
course
of
two
hours
or
so
we
arrived
at
the
dwelling
of
the
old
laird
chapter
xxxii
the
how
dreary
the
old
house
looked
as
we
approached
it
through
the
gathering
darkness
all
the
light
appeared
to
come
from
the
snow
which
rested
wherever
it
could
lie
on
roofs
and
window
ledges
and
turrets
even
on
the
windward
walls
every
little
roughness
sustained
its
own
frozen
patch
so
that
their
grey
was
spotted
all
over
with
whiteness
not
a
glimmer
shone
from
the
windows
nobody
lives
father
i
said
surely
it
does
not
look
very
lively
he
answered
the
house
stood
upon
a
bare
knoll
there
was
not
a
tree
within
sight
rugged
hills
arose
on
all
sides
of
it
not
a
sound
was
heard
but
the
moan
of
an
occasional
gust
of
wind
there
was
a
brook
but
it
lay
frozen
beneath
yards
of
snow
for
miles
in
any
direction
those
gusts
might
wander
without
shaking
door
or
window
or
carrying
with
them
a
puff
of
smoke
from
any
hearth
we
were
crossing
the
yard
at
the
back
of
the
house
towards
the
for
the
front
door
had
not
been
opened
for
months
when
we
recognized
the
first
sign
of
life
that
was
only
the
low
of
a
bullock
as
we
dismounted
on
a
few
feet
of
rough
pavement
which
had
been
swept
clear
an
old
woman
came
to
the
door
and
led
us
into
a
dreary
parlour
without
even
a
fire
to
welcome
us
i
learned
afterwards
that
the
laird
from
being
a
spendthrift
in
his
youth
had
become
a
miser
in
his
age
and
that
every
household
arrangement
was
on
the
narrowest
scale
from
wasting
righteous
pounds
he
had
come
to
scraping
unrighteous
farthings
after
we
had
remained
standing
for
some
time
the
housekeeper
returned
and
invited
my
father
to
go
to
the
laird
s
room
as
they
went
he
requested
her
to
take
me
to
the
kitchen
which
after
conducting
him
she
did
the
sight
of
the
fire
although
it
was
of
the
smallest
was
most
welcome
she
laid
a
few
more
peats
upon
it
and
encouraged
them
to
a
blaze
remarking
with
a
sidelong
look
we
daren
t
do
this
you
see
sir
if
the
laird
was
about
the
honest
man
would
call
it
is
he
dying
i
asked
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
but
she
only
shook
her
head
for
reply
and
going
to
a
press
at
the
other
end
of
the
large
kitchen
brought
me
some
milk
in
a
basin
and
some
oatcake
upon
a
platter
saying
it
s
not
my
house
you
see
or
i
would
have
something
better
to
set
before
the
minister
s
i
was
glad
of
any
food
however
and
it
was
well
for
me
that
i
ate
heartily
i
had
got
quite
warm
also
before
my
father
stepped
into
the
kitchen
very
solemn
and
stood
up
with
his
back
to
the
fire
the
old
woman
set
him
a
chair
but
he
neither
sat
down
nor
accepted
the
refreshment
which
she
humbly
offered
him
we
must
be
going
he
objected
for
it
looks
stormy
and
the
sooner
we
set
out
the
i
m
sorry
i
can
t
ask
you
to
stop
the
night
she
said
for
i
couldn
t
make
you
comfortable
there
s
nothing
fit
to
offer
you
in
the
house
and
there
s
not
a
bed
that
s
been
slept
in
for
i
don
t
know
how
never
mind
said
my
father
cheerfully
the
moon
is
up
already
and
we
shall
get
home
i
trust
before
the
snow
begins
to
fall
will
you
tell
the
man
to
get
the
horses
out
when
she
returned
from
taking
the
message
she
came
up
to
my
father
and
said
in
a
loud
whisper
is
he
in
a
bad
way
sir
he
is
dying
answered
my
father
illustration
i
know
that
she
returned
he
ll
be
gone
before
the
morning
but
that
s
not
what
i
meant
is
he
in
a
bad
way
for
the
other
world
that
s
what
i
meant
well
my
good
woman
after
a
life
like
his
we
are
only
too
glad
to
remember
what
our
lord
told
us
not
to
judge
i
do
think
he
is
ashamed
and
sorry
for
his
past
life
but
it
s
not
the
wrong
he
has
done
in
former
time
that
stands
half
so
much
in
his
way
as
his
present
fondness
for
what
he
counts
his
own
it
seems
like
to
break
his
heart
to
leave
all
his
little
bits
of
property
particularly
the
money
he
has
saved
and
yet
he
has
some
hope
that
jesus
christ
will
be
kind
enough
to
pardon
him
i
am
afraid
he
will
find
himself
very
miserable
though
when
he
has
not
one
scrap
left
to
call
his
own
not
a
it
s
dreadful
to
think
of
him
flying
through
the
air
on
a
night
like
this
said
she
my
good
woman
returned
my
father
we
know
nothing
about
where
or
how
the
departed
spirit
exists
after
it
has
left
the
body
but
it
seems
to
me
just
as
dreadful
to
be
without
god
in
the
world
as
to
be
without
him
anywhere
else
let
us
pray
for
him
that
god
may
be
with
him
wherever
he
so
saying
my
father
knelt
down
and
we
beside
him
and
he
prayed
earnestly
to
god
for
the
old
man
then
we
rose
mounted
our
horses
and
rode
away
we
were
only
about
halfway
home
when
the
clouds
began
to
cover
the
moon
and
the
snow
began
to
fall
hitherto
we
had
got
on
pretty
well
for
there
was
light
enough
to
see
the
track
feeble
as
it
was
now
however
we
had
to
keep
a
careful
lookout
we
pressed
our
horses
and
they
went
bravely
but
it
was
slow
work
at
the
best
it
got
darker
and
darker
for
the
clouds
went
on
gathering
and
the
snow
was
coming
down
in
huge
dull
flakes
faster
and
thicker
they
came
until
at
length
we
could
see
nothing
of
the
road
before
us
and
were
compelled
to
leave
all
to
the
wisdom
of
our
horses
my
father
having
great
confidence
in
his
own
little
mare
which
had
carried
him
through
many
a
doubtful
and
difficult
place
rode
first
i
followed
close
behind
he
kept
on
talking
to
me
very
cheerfully
i
have
thought
since
to
prevent
me
from
getting
frightened
but
i
had
not
a
thought
of
fear
to
be
with
my
father
was
to
me
perfect
safety
he
was
in
the
act
of
telling
me
how
on
more
occasions
than
one
missy
had
got
him
through
places
where
the
road
was
impassable
by
walking
on
the
tops
of
the
walls
when
all
at
once
both
our
horses
plunged
into
a
gulf
of
snow
the
more
my
mare
struggled
the
deeper
we
sank
in
it
for
a
moment
i
thought
it
was
closing
over
my
head
father
father
i
shouted
don
t
be
frightened
my
boy
cried
my
father
his
voice
seeming
to
come
from
far
away
we
are
in
god
s
hands
i
can
t
help
you
now
but
as
soon
as
missy
has
got
quieter
i
shall
come
to
you
i
think
i
know
whereabouts
we
are
we
ve
dropped
right
off
the
road
you
re
not
hurt
are
you
not
in
the
least
i
answered
i
was
only
a
few
moments
more
and
my
mare
lay
or
rather
stuck
quiet
with
her
neck
and
head
thrown
back
and
her
body
deep
in
the
snow
i
put
up
my
hands
to
feel
it
rose
above
my
head
farther
than
i
could
reach
i
got
clear
of
the
stirrups
and
scrambled
up
first
on
my
knees
and
then
on
my
feet
standing
thus
upon
the
saddle
again
i
stretched
my
hands
above
my
head
but
still
the
broken
wall
of
snow
ascended
above
my
reach
i
could
see
nothing
of
my
father
but
i
heard
him
talking
to
missy
my
mare
soon
began
floundering
again
so
that
i
tumbled
about
against
the
sides
of
the
hole
and
grew
terrified
lest
i
should
bring
the
snow
down
i
therefore
cowered
upon
the
mare
s
back
until
she
was
quiet
again
woa
quiet
my
lass
i
heard
my
father
saying
and
it
seemed
his
missy
was
more
frightened
than
mine
my
fear
was
now
quite
gone
and
i
felt
much
inclined
to
laugh
at
the
fun
of
the
misadventure
i
had
as
yet
no
idea
of
how
serious
a
thing
it
might
be
still
i
had
sense
enough
to
see
that
something
must
be
done
but
what
i
saw
no
way
of
getting
out
of
the
hole
except
by
trampling
down
the
snow
upon
the
back
of
my
poor
mare
and
that
i
could
not
think
of
while
i
doubted
much
whether
my
father
even
could
tell
in
what
direction
to
turn
for
help
or
shelter
illustration
finding
our
way
home
even
if
we
got
free
seemed
out
of
the
question
again
my
mare
began
plunging
violently
and
this
time
i
found
myself
thrown
against
some
hard
substance
i
thrust
my
hand
through
the
snow
and
felt
what
i
thought
the
stones
of
one
of
the
dry
walls
common
to
the
country
i
might
clear
away
enough
of
the
snow
to
climb
upon
that
but
then
what
next
it
was
so
dark
ranald
cried
my
father
how
do
you
get
on
much
the
same
father
i
answered
i
m
out
of
the
wreath
he
returned
we
ve
come
through
on
the
other
side
you
are
better
where
you
are
i
suspect
however
the
snow
is
warmer
than
the
air
it
is
beginning
to
blow
pull
your
feet
out
and
get
right
upon
the
mare
s
that
s
just
where
i
am
father
lying
on
her
back
and
pretty
comfortable
i
rejoined
all
this
time
the
snow
was
falling
thick
if
it
went
on
like
this
i
should
be
buried
before
morning
and
the
fact
that
the
wind
was
rising
added
to
the
danger
of
it
we
were
at
the
wrong
end
of
the
night
too
i
m
in
a
kind
of
ditch
i
think
father
i
cried
the
place
we
fell
off
on
one
side
and
a
stone
wall
on
the
that
can
hardly
be
or
i
shouldn
t
have
got
out
he
returned
but
now
i
ve
got
missy
quiet
i
ll
come
to
you
i
must
get
you
out
i
see
or
you
will
be
snowed
up
woa
missy
good
mare
stand
the
next
moment
he
gave
a
joyous
exclamation
what
is
it
father
i
cried
it
s
not
a
stone
wall
it
s
a
that
i
don
t
see
what
good
it
is
we
can
t
light
a
no
my
boy
but
where
there
s
a
there
s
probably
a
he
began
uttering
a
series
of
shouts
at
the
top
of
his
voice
listening
between
for
a
response
this
lasted
a
good
while
i
began
to
get
very
cold
i
m
nearly
frozen
father
i
said
and
what
s
to
become
of
the
poor
mare
she
s
got
no
clothes
on
i
ll
get
you
out
my
boy
and
then
at
least
you
will
be
able
to
move
about
a
i
heard
him
shovelling
at
the
snow
with
his
hands
and
feet
i
have
got
to
the
corner
of
the
stack
and
as
well
as
i
can
judge
you
must
be
just
round
it
he
said
your
voice
is
close
to
me
i
answered
i
ve
got
a
hold
of
one
of
the
mare
s
ears
he
said
next
i
won
t
try
to
get
her
out
until
i
get
you
off
i
put
out
my
hand
and
felt
along
the
mare
s
neck
what
a
joy
it
was
to
catch
my
father
s
hand
through
the
darkness
and
the
snow
he
grasped
mine
and
drew
me
towards
him
then
got
me
by
the
arm
and
began
dragging
me
through
the
snow
the
mare
began
plunging
again
and
by
her
struggles
rather
assisted
my
father
in
a
few
moments
he
had
me
in
his
arms
thank
god
he
said
as
he
set
me
down
against
the
stand
there
a
little
farther
keep
well
off
for
fear
she
hurt
you
she
must
fight
her
way
out
he
went
back
to
the
mare
and
went
on
clearing
away
the
snow
then
i
could
hear
him
patting
and
encouraging
her
next
i
heard
a
great
blowing
and
scrambling
and
at
last
a
snort
and
the
thunder
of
hoofs
woa
woa
gently
gently
she
s
off
cried
my
father
her
mother
gave
one
snort
and
away
she
went
thundering
after
her
but
their
sounds
were
soon
quenched
in
the
snow
there
s
a
business
said
my
father
i
m
afraid
the
poor
things
will
only
go
farther
to
fare
the
worse
we
are
as
well
without
them
however
and
if
they
should
find
their
way
home
so
much
the
better
for
us
they
might
have
kept
us
a
little
warmer
though
we
must
fight
the
cold
as
we
best
can
for
the
rest
of
the
night
for
it
would
only
be
folly
to
leave
the
spot
before
it
is
light
enough
to
see
where
we
are
it
came
into
my
mind
suddenly
how
i
had
burrowed
in
the
straw
to
hide
myself
after
running
from
dame
shand
s
but
whether
that
or
the
thought
of
burrowing
in
the
came
first
i
can
not
tell
i
turned
and
felt
whether
i
could
draw
out
a
peat
with
a
little
loosening
i
succeeded
father
i
said
couldn
t
we
make
a
hole
in
the
and
build
ourselves
in
a
capital
idea
my
boy
he
answered
with
a
gladness
in
his
voice
which
i
venture
to
attribute
in
part
to
his
satisfaction
at
finding
that
i
had
some
practical
sense
in
me
we
ll
try
it
at
i
ve
got
two
or
three
out
already
i
said
for
i
had
gone
on
pulling
and
it
was
easy
enough
after
one
had
been
started
we
must
take
care
we
don
t
bring
down
the
whole
stack
though
said
my
father
even
then
i
returned
we
could
build
ourselves
up
in
them
and
that
would
be
right
ranald
it
would
be
only
making
houses
to
our
own
shape
instead
of
big
enough
to
move
about
in
turning
crustaceous
animals
you
it
would
be
a
at
least
i
remarked
pulling
away
here
he
said
i
will
put
my
stick
in
under
the
top
row
that
will
be
a
sort
of
lintel
to
support
those
he
always
carried
his
whether
he
rode
or
walked
we
worked
with
a
will
piling
up
the
peats
a
little
in
front
that
we
might
with
them
build
up
the
door
of
our
cave
after
we
were
inside
we
got
quite
merry
over
it
we
shall
be
brought
before
the
magistrates
for
destruction
of
property
said
my
father
you
ll
have
to
send
andrew
to
build
up
the
stack
again
that
s
but
i
wonder
how
it
is
that
nobody
hears
us
how
can
they
have
a
so
far
from
the
house
i
can
t
imagine
i
said
except
it
be
to
prevent
them
from
burning
too
many
peats
it
is
more
like
a
trick
of
the
poor
laird
than
anybody
every
now
and
then
a
few
would
come
down
with
a
rush
and
before
long
we
had
made
a
large
hole
we
left
a
good
thick
floor
to
sit
upon
creeping
in
we
commenced
building
up
the
entrance
we
had
not
proceeded
far
however
before
we
found
that
our
cave
was
too
small
and
that
as
we
should
have
to
remain
in
it
for
hours
we
must
find
it
very
cramped
therefore
instead
of
using
any
more
of
the
peats
already
pulled
out
we
finished
building
up
the
wall
with
others
fresh
drawn
from
the
inside
when
at
length
we
had
to
the
best
of
our
ability
completed
our
immuring
we
sat
down
to
wait
for
the
morning
my
father
as
calm
as
if
he
had
been
seated
in
his
and
i
in
a
state
of
condensed
delight
for
was
not
this
a
grand
adventure
with
my
father
to
share
it
and
keep
it
from
going
too
far
he
sat
with
his
back
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
hole
and
i
sat
between
his
knees
and
leaned
against
him
his
arms
were
folded
round
me
and
could
ever
boy
be
more
blessed
than
i
was
then
the
sense
of
outside
danger
the
knowledge
that
if
the
wind
rose
we
might
be
walled
up
in
snow
before
the
morning
the
assurance
of
present
safety
and
good
hope
all
made
such
an
impression
upon
my
mind
that
ever
since
when
any
trouble
has
threatened
me
i
have
invariably
turned
first
in
thought
to
the
memory
of
that
harbour
of
refuge
from
the
storm
there
i
sat
for
long
hours
secure
in
my
father
s
arms
and
knew
that
the
soundless
snow
was
falling
thick
around
us
and
marked
occasionally
the
threatening
wail
of
the
wind
like
the
cry
of
a
wild
beast
scenting
us
from
afar
this
is
grand
father
i
said
you
would
like
better
to
be
at
home
in
bed
wouldn
t
you
he
asked
trying
me
no
indeed
i
should
not
i
answered
with
more
than
honesty
for
i
felt
exuberantly
happy
if
only
we
can
keep
warm
said
my
father
if
you
should
get
very
cold
indeed
you
must
not
lose
heart
my
man
but
think
how
pleasant
it
will
be
when
we
get
home
to
a
good
fire
and
a
hot
i
think
i
can
bear
it
all
right
i
have
often
been
cold
enough
at
this
may
be
worse
but
we
need
not
anticipate
evil
that
is
to
send
out
for
the
suffering
it
is
well
to
be
prepared
for
it
but
it
is
ill
to
brood
over
a
fancied
future
of
evil
in
all
my
life
my
boy
and
i
should
like
you
to
remember
what
i
say
i
have
never
found
any
trial
go
beyond
what
i
could
bear
in
the
worst
cases
of
suffering
i
think
there
is
help
given
which
those
who
look
on
can
not
understand
but
which
enables
the
sufferer
to
endure
the
last
help
of
that
kind
is
death
which
i
think
is
always
a
blessing
though
few
people
can
regard
it
as
i
listened
with
some
wonder
without
being
able
to
see
that
what
he
said
was
true
i
could
yet
accept
it
after
a
vague
fashion
this
nest
which
we
have
made
to
shelter
us
he
resumed
brings
to
my
mind
what
the
psalmist
says
about
dwelling
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
everyone
who
will
may
there
like
the
swallow
make
himself
a
this
can
t
be
very
like
that
though
surely
father
i
ventured
to
object
why
not
my
boy
it
s
not
safe
enough
for
one
you
are
right
there
still
it
is
like
it
is
our
place
of
the
cold
does
get
through
it
but
it
keeps
our
minds
at
peace
even
the
refuge
in
god
does
not
always
secure
us
from
external
suffering
the
heart
may
be
quite
happy
and
strong
when
the
hands
are
benumbed
with
cold
yes
the
heart
even
may
grow
cold
with
coming
death
while
the
man
himself
retreats
the
farther
into
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
growing
more
calm
and
hopeful
as
the
last
cold
invades
the
house
of
his
body
i
believe
that
all
troubles
come
to
drive
us
into
that
refuge
that
secret
place
where
alone
we
can
be
safe
you
will
when
you
go
out
into
the
world
my
boy
find
that
most
men
not
only
do
not
believe
this
but
do
not
believe
that
you
believe
it
they
regard
it
at
best
as
a
fantastic
weakness
fit
only
for
sickly
people
but
watch
how
the
strength
of
such
people
their
calmness
and
common
sense
fares
when
the
grasp
of
suffering
lays
hold
upon
them
it
was
a
sad
sight
that
abject
hopeless
misery
i
saw
this
afternoon
if
his
mind
had
been
an
indication
of
the
reality
one
must
have
said
that
there
was
no
god
no
god
at
least
that
would
have
anything
to
do
with
him
the
universe
as
reflected
in
the
tarnished
mirror
of
his
soul
was
a
chill
misty
void
through
which
blew
the
moaning
wind
of
an
unknown
fate
as
near
as
ever
i
saw
it
that
man
was
without
god
and
without
hope
in
the
world
all
who
have
done
the
mightiest
things
i
do
not
mean
the
showiest
things
all
that
are
like
william
of
orange
the
great
william
i
mean
not
our
king
william
or
john
milton
or
william
penn
or
any
other
of
the
cloud
of
witnesses
spoken
of
in
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
all
the
men
i
say
who
have
done
the
mightiest
things
have
not
only
believed
that
there
was
this
refuge
in
god
but
have
themselves
more
or
less
entered
into
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
there
only
could
they
have
found
strength
to
do
their
mighty
deeds
they
were
able
to
do
them
because
they
knew
god
wanted
them
to
do
them
that
he
was
on
their
side
or
rather
they
were
on
his
side
and
therefore
safe
surrounded
by
god
on
every
side
my
boy
do
the
will
of
god
that
is
what
you
know
or
believe
to
be
right
and
fear
i
never
forgot
the
lesson
but
my
readers
must
not
think
that
my
father
often
talked
like
this
he
was
not
at
all
favourable
to
much
talk
about
religion
he
used
to
say
that
much
talk
prevented
much
thought
and
talk
without
thought
was
bad
therefore
it
was
for
the
most
part
only
upon
extraordinary
occasions
of
which
this
is
an
example
that
he
spoke
of
the
deep
simplicities
of
that
faith
in
god
which
was
the
very
root
of
his
conscious
life
he
was
silent
after
this
utterance
which
lasted
longer
than
i
have
represented
although
unbroken
i
believe
by
any
remark
of
mine
full
of
inward
repose
i
fell
asleep
in
his
arms
when
i
awoke
i
found
myself
very
cold
then
i
became
aware
that
my
father
was
asleep
and
for
the
first
time
began
to
be
uneasy
it
was
not
because
of
the
cold
that
was
not
at
all
unendurable
it
was
that
while
the
night
lay
awful
in
white
silence
about
me
while
the
wind
was
moaning
outside
and
blowing
long
thin
currents
through
the
peat
walls
around
me
while
our
warm
home
lay
far
away
and
i
could
not
tell
how
many
hours
of
cold
darkness
had
yet
to
pass
before
we
could
set
out
to
find
it
it
was
not
all
these
things
together
but
that
in
the
midst
of
all
these
i
was
awake
and
my
father
slept
i
could
easily
have
waked
him
but
i
was
not
selfish
enough
for
that
i
sat
still
and
shivered
and
felt
very
dreary
then
the
last
words
of
my
father
began
to
return
upon
me
and
with
a
throb
of
relief
the
thought
awoke
in
my
mind
that
although
my
father
was
asleep
the
great
father
of
us
both
he
in
whose
heart
lay
that
secret
place
of
refuge
neither
slumbered
nor
slept
and
now
i
was
able
to
wait
in
patience
with
an
idea
if
not
a
sense
of
the
present
care
of
god
such
as
i
had
never
had
before
when
after
some
years
my
father
was
taken
from
us
the
thought
of
this
night
came
again
and
again
and
i
would
say
in
my
heart
my
father
sleeps
that
i
may
know
the
better
that
the
father
at
length
he
stirred
the
first
sign
of
his
awaking
was
that
he
closed
again
the
arms
about
me
which
had
dropped
by
his
sides
as
he
slept
i
m
so
glad
you
re
awake
father
i
said
speaking
first
have
been
long
awake
then
not
so
very
long
but
i
felt
lonely
without
are
you
very
cold
feel
rather
so
we
chatted
away
for
a
while
i
wonder
if
it
is
nearly
day
yet
i
do
not
in
the
least
know
how
long
we
have
slept
i
wonder
if
my
watch
is
going
i
forgot
to
wind
it
up
last
night
if
it
has
stopped
i
shall
know
it
is
near
he
held
his
watch
to
his
ear
alas
it
was
ticking
vigorously
he
felt
for
the
keyhole
and
wound
it
up
after
that
we
employed
ourselves
in
repeating
as
many
of
the
metrical
psalms
and
paraphrases
of
scripture
as
we
could
recollect
and
this
helped
away
a
good
part
of
the
weary
time
but
it
went
very
slowly
and
i
was
growing
so
cold
that
i
could
hardly
bear
it
i
m
afraid
you
feel
very
cold
ranald
said
my
father
folding
me
closer
in
his
arms
you
must
try
not
to
go
to
sleep
again
for
that
would
be
dangerous
now
i
feel
more
cramped
than
as
he
said
this
he
extended
his
legs
and
threw
his
head
back
to
get
rid
of
the
uneasiness
by
stretching
himself
the
same
moment
down
came
a
shower
of
peats
upon
our
heads
and
bodies
and
when
i
tried
to
move
i
found
myself
fixed
i
could
not
help
laughing
father
i
cried
as
soon
as
i
could
speak
you
re
like
samson
you
ve
brought
down
the
house
upon
so
i
have
my
boy
it
was
very
thoughtless
of
me
i
don
t
know
what
we
to
do
can
you
move
father
can
t
i
said
i
can
move
my
legs
but
i
m
afraid
to
move
even
a
toe
in
my
boot
for
fear
of
bringing
down
another
avalanche
of
peats
but
no
there
s
not
much
danger
of
that
they
are
all
down
already
for
i
feel
the
snow
on
my
with
hands
and
feet
my
father
struggled
but
could
not
do
much
for
i
lay
against
him
under
a
great
heap
his
struggles
made
an
opening
sideways
however
father
father
shout
i
cried
i
see
a
light
somewhere
and
i
think
it
is
we
shouted
as
loud
as
we
could
and
then
lay
listening
my
heart
beat
so
that
i
was
afraid
i
should
not
hear
any
reply
that
might
come
but
the
next
moment
it
rang
through
the
frosty
air
it
s
turkey
that
s
turkey
father
i
cried
i
know
his
shout
he
makes
it
go
farther
than
anybody
turkey
turkey
i
shrieked
almost
weeping
with
delight
again
turkey
s
cry
rang
through
the
darkness
and
the
light
drew
wavering
nearer
mind
how
you
step
turkey
cried
my
father
there
s
a
hole
you
may
tumble
it
wouldn
t
hurt
him
much
in
the
snow
i
said
perhaps
not
but
he
would
probably
lose
his
light
and
that
we
can
hardly
shout
again
cried
turkey
i
can
t
make
out
where
you
my
father
shouted
am
i
coming
nearer
to
you
now
i
can
hardly
say
i
can
not
see
well
are
you
going
along
the
road
yes
can
t
you
come
to
me
not
yet
we
can
t
get
out
we
re
upon
your
right
hand
in
a
oh
i
know
the
i
ll
be
with
you
in
a
he
did
not
however
find
it
so
easily
as
he
had
expected
the
peats
being
covered
with
snow
my
father
gave
up
trying
to
free
himself
and
took
to
laughing
instead
at
the
ridiculous
situation
in
which
we
were
about
to
be
discovered
he
kept
directing
turkey
however
who
at
length
after
some
disappearances
which
made
us
very
anxious
about
the
lantern
caught
sight
of
the
stack
and
walked
straight
towards
it
now
first
we
saw
that
he
was
not
alone
but
accompanied
by
the
silent
andrew
where
are
you
sir
asked
turkey
throwing
the
light
of
the
lantern
over
the
ruin
buried
in
the
peats
answered
my
father
laughing
come
and
get
us
turkey
strode
up
to
the
heap
and
turning
the
light
down
into
it
said
i
didn
t
know
it
had
been
raining
peats
the
peats
didn
t
fall
quite
so
far
as
the
snow
turkey
or
they
would
have
made
a
worse
job
of
it
answered
my
father
meantime
andrew
and
turkey
were
both
busy
and
in
a
few
moments
we
stood
upon
our
feet
stiff
with
cold
and
cramped
with
confinement
but
merry
enough
at
heart
what
brought
you
out
to
look
for
us
asked
my
father
i
heard
missy
whinnying
at
the
said
andrew
when
i
saw
she
was
alone
i
knew
something
had
happened
and
waked
turkey
we
only
stopped
to
run
to
the
manse
for
a
drop
of
whisky
to
bring
with
us
and
set
out
at
what
o
clock
is
it
now
asked
my
father
about
one
o
clock
answered
andrew
one
o
clock
thought
i
what
a
time
we
should
have
had
to
wait
have
you
been
long
in
finding
us
only
about
an
then
the
little
mare
must
have
had
great
trouble
in
getting
home
you
say
the
other
was
not
with
her
no
sir
she
s
not
made
her
then
if
we
don
t
find
her
she
will
be
dead
before
morning
but
what
shall
we
do
with
you
ranald
turkey
had
better
go
home
with
you
please
let
me
go
too
i
said
are
you
able
to
walk
quite
or
at
least
i
shall
be
after
my
legs
come
to
themselves
a
turkey
produced
a
bottle
of
milk
which
he
had
brought
for
me
and
andrew
produced
the
little
flask
of
whisky
which
kirsty
had
sent
and
my
father
having
taken
a
little
of
the
latter
while
i
emptied
my
bottle
we
set
out
to
look
for
young
missy
where
are
we
asked
my
father
turkey
told
him
how
comes
it
that
nobody
heard
our
shouting
then
you
know
sir
answered
turkey
the
old
man
is
as
deaf
as
a
post
and
i
dare
say
his
people
were
all
fast
the
snow
was
falling
only
in
a
few
large
flakes
now
which
sank
through
the
air
like
the
moultings
of
some
lovely
bird
of
heaven
the
moon
had
come
out
again
and
the
white
world
lay
around
us
in
lovely
light
a
good
deal
of
snow
had
fallen
while
we
lay
in
the
peats
but
we
could
yet
trace
the
track
of
the
two
horses
we
followed
it
a
long
way
through
the
little
valley
into
which
we
had
dropped
from
the
side
of
the
road
we
came
to
more
places
than
one
where
they
had
been
floundering
together
in
a
but
at
length
reached
the
spot
where
one
had
parted
from
the
other
when
we
had
traced
one
of
the
tracks
to
the
road
we
concluded
it
was
missy
s
and
returned
to
the
other
but
we
had
not
followed
it
very
far
before
we
came
upon
the
poor
mare
lying
upon
her
back
in
a
deep
runnel
in
which
the
snow
was
very
soft
she
had
put
her
forefeet
in
it
as
she
galloped
heedlessly
along
and
tumbled
right
over
the
snow
had
yielded
enough
to
let
the
banks
get
a
hold
of
her
and
she
lay
helpless
turkey
and
andrew
however
had
had
the
foresight
to
bring
spades
with
them
and
a
rope
and
they
set
to
work
at
once
my
father
taking
a
turn
now
and
then
and
i
holding
the
lantern
which
was
all
but
useless
now
in
the
moonlight
it
took
more
than
an
hour
to
get
the
poor
thing
on
her
legs
again
but
when
she
was
up
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
hold
her
she
was
so
wild
with
cold
and
with
delight
at
feeling
her
legs
under
her
once
more
that
she
would
have
broken
loose
again
and
galloped
off
as
recklessly
as
ever
they
set
me
on
her
back
and
with
my
father
on
one
side
and
turkey
on
the
other
and
andrew
at
her
head
i
rode
home
in
great
comfort
it
was
another
good
hour
before
we
arrived
and
right
glad
were
we
to
see
through
the
curtains
of
the
parlour
the
glow
of
the
great
fire
which
kirsty
had
kept
up
for
us
she
burst
out
crying
when
we
made
our
appearance
chapter
xxxiii
a
solitary
chapter
during
all
that
winter
i
attended
the
evening
school
and
assisted
the
master
i
confess
however
it
was
not
by
any
means
so
much
for
the
master
as
to
be
near
elsie
duff
of
whom
i
now
thought
many
times
an
hour
her
sweet
face
grew
more
and
more
dear
to
me
when
i
pointed
out
an
error
in
her
work
or
suggested
a
better
mode
of
working
it
would
flush
like
the
heart
of
a
white
rose
and
eagerly
she
would
set
herself
to
rectification
or
improvement
her
whole
manner
a
dumb
apology
for
what
could
be
a
fault
in
no
eyes
but
her
own
it
was
this
sweetness
that
gained
upon
me
at
length
her
face
was
almost
a
part
of
my
consciousness
i
suppose
my
condition
was
what
people
would
call
being
in
love
with
her
but
i
never
thought
of
that
i
only
thought
of
her
nor
did
i
ever
dream
of
saying
a
word
to
her
on
the
subject
i
wished
nothing
other
than
as
it
was
to
think
about
her
all
day
so
gently
that
it
never
disturbed
euclid
or
livy
to
see
her
at
night
and
get
near
her
now
and
then
sitting
on
the
same
form
with
her
as
i
explained
something
to
her
on
the
slate
or
in
her
book
to
hear
her
voice
and
look
into
her
tender
eyes
was
all
that
i
desired
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
things
could
not
go
on
so
that
a
change
must
come
that
as
life
can
not
linger
in
the
bud
but
is
compelled
by
the
sunshine
and
air
into
the
flower
so
life
would
go
on
and
on
and
things
would
change
and
the
time
blossom
into
something
else
and
my
love
find
itself
set
in
the
midst
of
strange
plants
and
a
new
order
of
things
when
school
was
over
i
walked
home
with
her
not
alone
for
turkey
was
always
on
the
other
side
i
had
not
a
suspicion
that
turkey
s
admiration
of
elsie
could
ever
come
into
collision
with
mine
we
joined
in
praising
her
but
my
admiration
ever
found
more
words
than
turkey
s
and
i
thought
my
love
to
her
was
greater
than
his
we
seldom
went
into
her
grandmother
s
cottage
for
she
did
not
make
us
welcome
after
we
had
taken
her
home
we
generally
repaired
to
turkey
s
mother
with
whom
we
were
sure
of
a
kind
reception
she
was
a
patient
diligent
woman
who
looked
as
if
she
had
nearly
done
with
life
and
had
only
to
gather
up
the
crumbs
of
it
i
have
often
wondered
since
what
was
her
deepest
thought
whether
she
was
content
to
be
unhappy
or
whether
she
lived
in
hope
of
some
blessedness
beyond
it
is
marvellous
with
how
little
happiness
some
people
can
get
through
the
world
surely
they
are
inwardly
sustained
with
something
even
better
than
joy
did
you
ever
hear
my
mother
sing
asked
turkey
as
we
sat
together
over
her
little
fire
on
one
of
these
occasions
no
i
should
like
very
much
i
answered
the
room
was
lighted
only
by
a
little
for
there
was
no
flame
to
the
fire
of
peats
and
dried
she
sings
such
queer
ballads
as
you
never
heard
said
turkey
give
us
one
mother
she
yielded
and
in
a
low
chanting
voice
sang
something
like
this
up
cam
the
waves
o
the
tide
wi
a
whush
and
back
gaed
the
pebbles
wi
a
whurr
whan
the
king
s
ae
son
cam
walking
i
the
hush
to
hear
the
sea
murmur
and
murr
the
half
mune
was
risin
the
waves
abune
an
a
glimmer
o
cauld
weet

ower
the

straucht
frae
the

what
s

an
that
far
oot
i
the
grey
atwixt
the
mune
and
the
land
it
s
the
bonny
at
their
play
haud
awa
king
s
son
frae
the
strand
ae
rock
stud
up
wi
a
shadow
at
its
foot
the
king
s
son
stepped
behind
the
merry
cam
gambolling
oot
combin
their
hair
i
the
wind
o
merry
their
laugh
when
they
felt
the
land
under
their
light
cool
feet
each
laid
her
comb
on
the
yellow
sand
and
the
gladsome
dance
grew
fleet
but
the
fairest
she
laid
her
comb
by
itsel
on
the
rock
where
the
king
s
son
lay
he
stole
about
and
the
carven
shell
he
hid
in
his
bosom
away
and
he
watched
the
dance
till
the
clouds
did
gloom
and
the
wind
blew
an
angry
tune
one
after
one
she
caught
up
her
comb
to
the
sea
went
dancin
doon
but
the
fairest
wi
hair
like
the
mune
in
a
clud
she
sought
till
she
was
the
last
he
creepin
went
and
watchin
stud
and
he
thought
to
hold
her
fast
she
dropped
at
his
feet
without
motion
or
heed
he
took
her
and
home
he
all
day
she
lay
like
a
withered
seaweed
on
a
purple
and
gowden
bed
but
at
night
whan
the
wind
frae
the
watery
bars
blew
into
the
dusky
room
she
opened
her
een
like
twa
settin
stars
and
back
came
her
twilight
bloom
the
king
s
son
knelt
beside
her
bed
she
was
his
ere
a
month
had
passed
and
the
cold
he
had
wed
grew
a
tender
wife
at
last
and
all
went
well
till
her
baby
was
born
and
then
she
couldna
sleep
she
would
rise
and
wander
till
breakin
morn
the
sound
o
the
deep
one
night
when
the
wind
was
wailing
about
and
the
sea
was
speckled
wi
foam
from
room
to
room
she
went
in
and
out
and
she
came
on
her
carven
comb
she
twisted
her
hair
with
eager
hands
she
put
in
the
comb
with
glee
she
s
out
and
she
s
over
the
glittering
sands
and
away
to
the
moaning
sea
one
cry
came
back
from
far
away
he
woke
and
was
all
alone
her
night
robe
lay
on
the
marble
grey
and
the
cold
was
gone
ever
and
aye
frae
first
peep
o
the
moon
whan
the
wind
blew
aff
o
the
sea
the
desert
shore
still
up
and
doon
heavy
at
heart
paced
he
but
never
more
came
the
maidens
to
play
from
the
merry
sea
he
heard
their
laughter
far
out
and
away
but
heavy
at
heart
paced
he
i
have
modernized
the
ballad
indeed
spoiled
it
altogether
for
i
have
made
up
this
version
from
the
memory
of
it
with
only
i
fear
just
a
touch
here
and
there
of
the
original
expression
that
s
what
comes
of
taking
what
you
have
no
right
to
said
turkey
in
whom
the
practical
had
ever
the
upper
hand
of
the
imaginative
as
we
walked
home
together
i
resumed
the
subject
i
think
you
re
too
hard
on
the
king
s
son
i
said
he
couldn
t
help
falling
in
love
with
the
he
had
no
business
to
steal
her
comb
and
then
run
away
with
herself
said
turkey
she
was
none
the
worse
for
it
said
i
who
told
you
that
he
retorted
i
don
t
think
the
girl
herself
would
have
said
so
it
s
not
every
girl
that
would
care
to
marry
a
king
s
son
she
might
have
had
a
lover
of
her
own
down
in
the
sea
at
all
events
the
prince
was
none
the
better
for
but
the
song
says
she
made
a
tender
wife
i
objected
she
couldn
t
help
herself
she
made
the
best
of
it
i
dare
say
he
wasn
t
a
bad
sort
of
a
fellow
but
he
was
no
turkey
i
exclaimed
he
was
a
prince
i
know
then
he
must
have
been
a
i
don
t
know
that
i
ve
read
of
a
good
many
princes
who
did
things
i
should
be
ashamed
to
but
you
re
not
a
prince
turkey
i
returned
in
the
low
endeavour
to
bolster
up
the
wrong
with
my
silly
logic
no
therefore
if
i
were
to
do
what
was
rude
and
dishonest
people
would
say
what
could
you
expect
of
a
ploughboy
a
prince
ought
to
be
just
so
much
better
bred
than
a
ploughboy
i
would
scorn
to
do
what
that
prince
did
what
s
wrong
in
a
ploughboy
can
t
be
right
in
a
prince
ranald
or
else
right
is
only
right
sometimes
so
that
right
may
be
wrong
and
wrong
may
be
right
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
there
is
no
right
and
wrong
and
if
there
s
no
right
and
wrong
the
world
s
an
awful
mess
and
there
can
t
be
any
god
for
a
god
would
never
have
made
it
like
well
turkey
you
know
best
i
can
t
help
thinking
the
prince
was
not
so
much
to
blame
you
see
what
came
of
it
perhaps
he
would
rather
have
had
the
misery
and
all
together
than
none
of
that
s
for
him
to
settle
but
he
must
have
seen
he
was
wrong
before
he
had
done
wandering
by
the
sea
like
well
now
turkey
what
would
you
have
done
yourself
suppose
the
beautifulest
of
them
all
had
laid
her
comb
down
within
an
inch
of
where
you
were
standing
and
never
saw
you
you
know
turkey
thought
for
a
moment
before
answering
i
m
supposing
you
fell
in
love
with
her
at
first
sight
you
know
i
added
well
i
m
sure
i
should
not
have
kept
the
comb
even
if
i
had
taken
it
just
to
get
a
chance
of
speaking
to
her
and
i
can
t
help
fancying
if
he
had
behaved
like
a
gentleman
and
let
her
go
without
touching
her
the
first
time
she
might
have
come
again
and
if
he
had
married
her
at
last
of
her
own
free
will
she
would
not
have
run
away
from
him
let
the
sea
have
kept
calling
her
ever
so
illustration
the
next
evening
i
looked
for
elsie
as
usual
but
did
not
see
her
how
blank
and
dull
the
schoolroom
seemed
still
she
might
arrive
any
moment
but
she
did
not
come
i
went
through
my
duties
wearily
hoping
ever
for
the
hour
of
release
i
could
see
well
enough
that
turkey
was
anxious
too
the
moment
school
was
over
we
hurried
away
almost
without
a
word
to
the
cottage
there
we
found
her
weeping
her
grandmother
had
died
suddenly
she
clung
to
turkey
and
seemed
almost
to
forget
my
presence
but
i
thought
nothing
of
that
had
the
case
been
mine
i
too
should
have
clung
to
turkey
from
faith
in
his
help
and
superior
wisdom
there
were
two
or
three
old
women
in
the
place
turkey
went
and
spoke
to
them
and
then
took
elsie
home
to
his
mother
jamie
was
asleep
and
they
would
not
wake
him
how
it
was
arranged
i
forget
but
both
elsie
and
jamie
lived
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
with
turkey
s
mother
the
cottage
was
let
and
the
cow
taken
home
by
their
father
before
summer
jamie
had
got
a
place
in
a
shop
in
the
village
and
then
elsie
went
back
to
her
mother
chapter
xxxiv
an
evening
visit
i
now
saw
much
less
of
elsie
but
i
went
with
turkey
as
often
as
i
could
to
visit
her
at
her
father
s
cottage
the
evenings
we
spent
there
are
amongst
the
happiest
hours
in
my
memory
one
evening
in
particular
appears
to
stand
out
as
a
type
of
the
whole
i
remember
every
point
in
the
visit
i
think
it
must
have
been
almost
the
last
we
set
out
as
the
sun
was
going
down
on
an
evening
in
the
end
of
april
when
the
nightly
frosts
had
not
yet
vanished
the
hail
was
dancing
about
us
as
we
started
the
sun
was
disappearing
in
a
bank
of
tawny
orange
cloud
the
night
would
be
cold
and
dark
and
stormy
but
we
cared
nothing
for
that
a
conflict
with
the
elements
always
added
to
the
pleasure
of
any
undertaking
then
it
was
in
the
midst
of
another
shower
of
hail
driven
on
the
blasts
of
a
keen
wind
that
we
arrived
at
the
little
cottage
it
had
been
built
by
duff
himself
to
receive
his
bride
and
although
since
enlarged
was
still
a
very
little
house
it
had
a
foundation
of
stone
but
the
walls
were
of
turf
he
had
lined
it
with
boards
however
and
so
made
it
warmer
and
more
comfortable
than
most
of
the
labourers
dwellings
when
we
entered
a
glowing
fire
of
peat
was
on
the
hearth
and
the
pot
with
the
supper
hung
over
it
duff
was
spinning
and
elsie
by
the
light
of
a
little
oil
lamp
suspended
against
the
wall
was
teaching
her
youngest
brother
to
read
whatever
she
did
she
always
seemed
in
my
eyes
to
do
it
better
than
anyone
else
and
to
see
her
under
the
lamp
with
one
arm
round
the
little
fellow
who
stood
leaning
against
her
while
the
other
hand
pointed
with
a
to
the
letters
of
the
which
lay
on
her
knee
was
to
see
a
lovely
picture
the
mother
did
not
rise
from
her
spinning
but
spoke
a
kindly
welcome
while
elsie
got
up
and
without
approaching
us
or
saying
more
than
a
word
or
two
set
chairs
for
us
by
the
fire
and
took
the
little
fellow
away
to
put
him
to
bed
it
s
a
cold
night
said
duff
the
wind
seems
to
blow
through
me
as
i
sit
at
my
wheel
i
wish
my
husband
would
come
he
ll
be
suppering
his
horses
said
turkey
i
ll
just
run
across
and
give
him
a
hand
and
that
ll
bring
him
in
the
thank
you
turkey
said
duff
as
he
vanished
he
s
a
fine
lad
she
remarked
much
in
the
same
phrase
my
father
used
when
speaking
of
him
there
s
nobody
like
turkey
i
said
indeed
i
think
you
re
right
there
ranald
a
lad
doesn
t
step
he
ll
do
something
to
distinguish
himself
some
day
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
he
went
to
college
and
wagged
his
head
in
a
pulpit
the
idea
of
turkey
wagging
his
head
in
a
pulpit
made
me
laugh
wait
till
you
see
resumed
duff
somewhat
offended
at
my
reception
of
her
prophecy
folk
will
hear
of
him
i
didn
t
mean
he
couldn
t
be
a
minister
duff
but
i
don
t
think
he
will
take
to
here
elsie
came
back
and
lifting
the
lid
of
the
pot
examined
the
state
of
its
contents
i
got
hold
of
her
hand
but
for
the
first
time
she
withdrew
it
i
did
not
feel
hurt
for
she
did
it
very
gently
then
she
began
to
set
the
white
deal
table
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
by
the
time
she
had
put
the
plates
and
spoons
upon
it
the
water
in
the
pot
was
boiling
and
she
began
to
make
the
porridge
at
which
she
was
judged
to
be
in
my
mind
equal
to
our
kirsty
by
the
time
it
was
ready
her
father
and
turkey
came
in
james
duff
said
grace
and
we
sat
down
to
our
supper
the
wind
was
blowing
hard
outside
and
every
now
and
then
the
hail
came
in
deafening
rattles
against
the
little
windows
and
descending
the
wide
chimney
danced
on
the
floor
about
the
hearth
but
not
a
thought
of
the
long
stormy
way
between
us
and
home
interfered
with
the
enjoyment
of
the
hour
after
supper
which
was
enlivened
by
simple
chat
about
the
crops
and
the
doings
on
the
farm
james
turned
to
me
and
said
haven
t
you
got
a
song
or
a
ballad
to
give
us
ranald
i
know
you
re
always
getting
hold
of
such
i
had
expected
this
for
every
time
i
went
i
tried
to
have
something
to
repeat
to
them
as
i
could
not
sing
this
was
the
nearest
way
in
which
i
might
contribute
to
the
evening
s
entertainment
elsie
was
very
fond
of
ballads
and
i
could
hardly
please
her
better
than
by
bringing
a
new
one
with
me
but
in
default
of
that
an
old
one
or
a
story
would
be
welcomed
my
reader
must
remember
that
there
were
very
few
books
to
be
had
then
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
therefore
any
mode
of
literature
was
precious
the
schoolmaster
was
the
chief
source
from
which
i
derived
my
provision
of
this
sort
on
the
present
occasion
i
was
prepared
with
a
ballad
of
his
i
remember
every
word
of
it
now
and
will
give
it
to
my
readers
reminding
them
once
more
how
easy
it
is
to
skip
it
if
they
do
not
care

duff
have
you
a
tune
it
would
go
to
elsie
elsie
thought
a
little
and
asked
me
to
repeat
the
first
verse
then
she
sung
it
out
clear
and
fair
to
a
tune
i
had
never
heard
before
that
will
do
splendidly
elsie
i
said
i
will
write
it
out
for
you
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
sing
it
all
the
next
time
i
she
made
me
no
answer
she
and
turkey
were
looking
at
each
other
and
did
not
hear
me
james
duff
began
to
talk
to
me
elsie
was
putting
away
the
in
a
few
minutes
i
missed
her
and
turkey
and
they
were
absent
for
some
time
they
did
not
return
together
but
first
turkey
and
elsie
some
minutes
after
as
the
night
was
now
getting
quite
stormy
james
duff
counselled
our
return
and
we
obeyed
but
little
either
turkey
or
i
cared
for
wind
or
hail
i
saw
elsie
at
church
most
sundays
but
she
was
far
too
attentive
and
modest
ever
to
give
me
even
a
look
sometimes
i
had
a
word
with
her
when
we
came
out
but
my
father
expected
us
to
walk
home
with
him
and
i
generally
saw
turkey
walk
away
with
her
illustration
chapter
xxxv
a
break
in
my
story
i
am
now
rapidly
approaching
the
moment
at
which
i
said
i
should
bring
this
history
to
an
end
the
moment
namely
when
i
became
aware
that
my
boyhood
was
behind
me
i
left
home
this
summer
for
the
first
time
and
followed
my
brother
tom
to
the
grammar
school
in
the
in
order
afterwards
to
follow
him
to
the
university
there
was
so
much
of
novelty
and
expectation
in
the
change
that
i
did
not
feel
the
separation
from
my
father
and
the
rest
of
my
family
much
at
first
that
came
afterwards
for
the
time
the
pleasure
of
a
long
ride
on
the
top
of
the
with
a
bright
sun
and
a
pleasant
breeze
the
various
incidents
connected
with
changing
horses
and
starting
afresh
and
then
the
outlook
for
the
first
peep
of
the
sea
occupied
my
attention
too
thoroughly
i
do
not
care
to
dwell
on
my
experience
at
the
grammar
school
i
worked
fairly
and
got
on
but
whether
i
should
gain
a
scholarship
remained
doubtful
enough
before
the
time
for
the
examination
arrived
i
went
to
spend
a
week
at
home
it
was
a
great
disappointment
to
me
that
i
had
to
return
again
without
seeing
elsie
but
it
could
not
be
helped
the
only
sunday
i
had
there
was
a
stormy
day
late
in
october
and
elsie
had
a
bad
cold
as
turkey
informed
me
and
could
not
be
out
while
my
father
had
made
so
many
engagements
for
me
that
with
one
thing
and
another
i
was
not
able
to
go
and
see
her
turkey
was
now
doing
a
man
s
work
on
the
farm
and
stood
as
high
as
ever
in
the
estimation
of
my
father
and
everyone
who
knew
him
he
was
as
great
a
favourite
with
allister
and
davie
as
with
myself
and
took
very
much
the
same
place
with
the
former
as
he
had
taken
with
me
i
had
lost
nothing
of
my
regard
for
him
and
he
talked
to
me
with
the
same
familiarity
as
before
urging
me
to
diligence
and
thoroughness
in
my
studies
pressing
upon
me
that
no
one
had
ever
done
lasting
work
that
is
turkey
would
say
work
that
goes
to
the
making
of
the
world
without
being
in
earnest
as
to
the
and
conscientious
as
to
the
i
don
t
want
you
to
try
to
be
a
great
man
he
said
once
you
might
succeed
and
then
find
out
you
had
failed
how
could
that
be
turkey
i
objected
a
body
can
t
succeed
and
fail
both
at
a
body
might
succeed
he
replied
in
doing
what
he
wanted
to
do
and
then
find
out
that
it
was
not
in
the
least
what
he
had
thought
what
rule
are
you
to
follow
then
turkey
i
asked
just
the
rule
of
duty
he
replied
what
you
ought
to
do
that
you
must
do
then
when
a
choice
comes
not
involving
duty
you
know
choose
what
you
like
this
is
the
substance
of
what
he
said
if
anyone
thinks
it
pedantic
i
can
only
say
he
would
not
have
thought
so
if
he
had
heard
it
as
it
was
uttered
in
the
homely
forms
and
sounds
of
the
scottish
tongue
aren
t
you
fit
for
something
better
than
yourself
turkey
i
ventured
to
suggest
foolishly
impelled
i
suppose
to
try
whether
i
could
not
give
advice
too
it
s
work
said
turkey
in
a
decisive
tone
which
left
me
no
room
for
rejoinder
this
conversation
took
place
in
the
barn
where
turkey
happened
to
be
thrashing
alone
that
morning
in
turning
the
sheaf
or
in
laying
a
fresh
one
there
was
always
a
moment
s
pause
in
the
din
and
then
only
we
talked
so
that
our
conversation
was
a
good
deal
broken
i
had
buried
myself
in
the
straw
as
in
days
of
old
to
keep
myself
warm
and
there
i
lay
and
looked
at
turkey
while
he
thrashed
and
thought
with
myself
that
his
face
had
grown
much
more
solemn
than
it
used
to
be
but
when
he
smiled
which
was
seldom
all
the
old
merry
sweetness
dawned
again
this
was
the
last
long
talk
i
ever
had
with
him
the
next
day
i
returned
for
the
examination
was
happy
enough
to
gain
a
small
scholarship
and
entered
on
my
first
winter
at
college
my
father
wrote
to
me
once
a
week
or
so
and
occasionally
i
had
a
letter
with
more
ink
than
matter
in
it
from
one
of
my
younger
brothers
tom
was
now
in
edinburgh
in
a
lawyer
s
office
i
had
no
correspondence
with
turkey
wilson
wrote
to
me
sometimes
and
along
with
good
advice
would
occasionally
send
me
some
verses
but
he
told
me
little
or
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
chapter
xxxvi
i
learn
that
i
am
not
a
man
it
was
a
saturday
morning
very
early
in
april
when
i
climbed
the
to
return
to
my
home
for
the
summer
for
so
the
university
year
is
divided
in
scotland
the
sky
was
bright
with
great
fleecy
clouds
sailing
over
it
from
which
now
and
then
fell
a
shower
in
large
drops
the
wind
was
keen
and
i
had
to
wrap
myself
well
in
my
cloak
but
my
heart
was
light
and
full
of
the
pleasure
of
ended
and
successful
labour
of
and
the
signs
which
sun
and
sky
gave
that
the
summer
was
at
hand
five
months
had
gone
by
since
i
last
left
home
and
it
had
seemed
such
an
age
to
davie
that
he
burst
out
crying
when
he
saw
me
my
father
received
me
with
a
certain
still
tenderness
which
seemed
to
grow
upon
him
kirsty
followed
davie
s
example
and
allister
without
saying
much
haunted
me
like
my
shadow
i
saw
nothing
of
turkey
that
evening
in
the
morning
we
went
to
church
of
course
and
i
sat
beside
the
reclining
stone
warrior
from
whose
face
age
had
nearly
worn
the
features
away
i
gazed
at
him
all
the
time
of
the
singing
of
the
first
psalm
and
there
grew
upon
me
a
strange
solemnity
a
sense
of
the
passing
away
of
earthly
things
and
a
stronger
conviction
than
i
had
ever
had
of
the
need
of
something
that
could
not
pass
this
feeling
lasted
all
the
time
of
the
service
and
increased
while
i
lingered
in
the
church
almost
alone
until
my
father
should
come
out
of
the
vestry
i
stood
in
the
passage
leaning
against
the
tomb
a
cloud
came
over
the
sun
and
the
whole
church
grew
dark
as
a
december
day
gloomy
and
cheerless
i
heard
for
some
time
almost
without
hearing
them
two
old
women
talking
together
close
by
me
the
pulpit
was
between
them
and
me
but
when
i
became
thoroughly
aware
of
their
presence
i
peeped
round
and
saw
them
and
when
did
it
happen
said
you
asked
one
of
them
whose
head
moved
with
an
incessant
capricious
motion
from
palsy
about
two
o
clock
this
morning
answered
the
other
who
leaned
on
a
stick
almost
bent
double
with
rheumatism
i
saw
their
neighbour
this
morning
and
he
had
seen
jamie
who
goes
home
of
a
saturday
night
you
know
but
william
being
a
seceder
nobody
s
been
to
tell
the
minister
and
i
m
just
waiting
to
let
him
know
for
she
was
a
great
favourite
of
his
and
he
s
been
to
see
her
often
they
re
much
to
be
pitied
poor
people
nobody
thought
it
would
come
so
sudden
like
when
i
saw
her
mother
last
there
was
no
such
notion
in
her
before
i
could
ask
of
whom
they
were
talking
my
father
came
up
the
aisle
from
the
vestry
and
stopped
to
speak
to
the
old
women
elsie
duff
s
gone
poor
thing
said
the
rheumatic
one
i
grew
stupid
what
followed
i
have
forgotten
a
sound
was
in
my
ears
and
my
body
seemed
to
believe
it
though
my
soul
could
not
comprehend
it
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
alone
in
the
church
they
had
gone
away
without
seeing
me
i
was
standing
beside
the
monument
leaning
on
the
carved
crusader
the
sun
was
again
shining
and
the
old
church
was
full
of
light
but
the
sunshine
had
changed
to
me
and
i
felt
very
mournful
i
should
see
the
sweet
face
hear
the
lovely
voice
no
more
in
this
world
i
endeavoured
to
realize
the
thought
but
could
not
and
i
left
the
church
hardly
conscious
of
anything
but
a
dull
sense
of
loss
i
found
my
father
very
grave
he
spoke
tenderly
of
elsie
but
he
did
not
know
how
i
had
loved
her
and
i
could
not
make
much
response
i
think
too
that
he
said
less
than
he
otherwise
would
from
the
fear
of
calling
back
to
my
mind
too
vivid
a
memory
of
how
ill
i
had
once
behaved
to
her
it
was
indeed
my
first
thought
the
moment
he
uttered
her
name
but
it
soon
passed
for
much
had
come
between
in
the
evening
i
went
up
to
the
farm
to
look
for
turkey
who
had
not
been
at
church
morning
or
afternoon
he
was
the
only
one
i
could
talk
to
about
elsie
i
found
him
in
one
of
the
bedding
the
cows
his
back
was
towards
me
when
i
entered
turkey
i
said
he
looked
round
with
a
slow
mechanical
motion
as
if
with
a
conscious
effort
of
the
will
his
face
was
so
white
and
wore
such
a
look
of
loss
that
it
almost
terrified
me
like
the
presence
of
something
awful
i
stood
speechless
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
and
then
came
slowly
up
to
me
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
ranald
he
said
we
were
to
have
been
married
next
before
the
grief
of
the
man
mighty
in
its
silence
my
whole
being
was
humbled
i
knew
my
love
was
not
so
great
as
his
it
grew
in
my
eyes
a
pale
and
feeble
thing
and
i
felt
worthless
in
the
presence
of
her
dead
whom
alive
i
had
loved
with
peaceful
gladness
elsie
belonged
to
turkey
and
he
had
lost
her
and
his
heart
was
breaking
i
threw
my
arms
round
him
and
wept
for
him
not
for
myself
it
was
thus
i
ceased
to
be
a
boy
here
therefore
my
story
ends
before
i
returned
to
the
university
turkey
had
enlisted
and
left
the
place
illustration
my
father
s
concerning
him
is
now
fulfilled
he
is
a
general
i
will
not
tell
his
name
for
some
reason
or
other
he
had
taken
his
mother
s
and
by
that
he
is
well
known
i
have
never
seen
him
or
heard
from
him
since
he
left
my
father
s
service
but
i
am
confident
that
if
ever
we
meet
it
will
be
as
old
and
true
friends
