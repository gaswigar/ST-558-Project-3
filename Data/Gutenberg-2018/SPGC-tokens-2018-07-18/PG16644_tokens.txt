one
bright
warm
noonday
in
may
of
the
year
goodwife
pepperell
opened
the
door
of
her
little
log
cabin
and
screening
her
eyes
from
the
sun
with
a
toilworn
hand
looked
about
in
every
direction
as
if
searching
for
some
one
she
was
a
tall
spare
woman
with
a
firm
mouth
keen
blue
eyes
and
a
look
of
patient
endurance
in
her
face
bred
by
the
stern
life
of
pioneer
new
england
far
away
across
the
pasture
which
sloped
southward
from
the
cabin
she
could
see
long
meadow
grass
waving
in
the
breeze
and
beyond
a
thread
of
blue
water
where
the
charles
river
flowed
lazily
to
the
sea
westward
there
was
also
pasture
land
where
sheep
were
grazing
and
in
the
distance
a
glimpse
of
the
thatched
roofs
of
the
little
village
of
cambridge
goodwife
pepperell
gazed
long
and
earnestly
in
this
direction
and
then
making
a
trumpet
of
her
hands
sent
a
call
ringing
across
the
silent
fields
nancy
daniel
she
shouted
she
was
answered
only
by
the
tinkle
of
sheep
bells
a
shade
of
anxiety
clouded
the
blue
eyes
as
she
went
round
to
the
back
of
the
cabin
and
looked
toward
the
dense
forest
which
bounded
her
vision
on
the
north
though
she
was
goodwife
pepperell
could
never
forget
the
terrors
which
lay
concealed
behind
that
mysterious
rampart
of
green
not
only
were
there
wolves
and
deer
and
many
other
wild
creatures
hidden
in
its
depths
but
it
sheltered
also
the
perpetual
menace
of
the
indians
toward
the
east
at
some
distance
from
the
cabin
stretched
to
salt
meadows
and
beyond
across
the
bay
she
could
see
the
three
hills
of
boston
town
footnote
see
map
as
no
answering
shout
greeted
her
from
this
direction
either
the
goodwife
stepped
quickly
toward
a
hollow
stump
which
stood
a
short
distance
from
the
cabin
beside
the
stump
a
slender
birch
tree
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
a
large
circular
piece
of
wood
hung
to
its
top
by
a
leather
thong
this
was
the
where
their
corn
was
pounded
into
meal
seizing
the
birch
tree
with
her
hands
she
brought
the
wooden
pestle
down
into
the
hollow
stump
with
a
resounding
thump
the
birch
tree
sprang
back
lifting
the
block
with
it
and
again
she
pulled
it
down
and
struck
the
stump
another
blow
then
paused
to
listen
this
time
there
was
beside
the
echo
an
answering
shout
and
in
a
few
moments
two
heads
appeared
above
the
rows
of
young
corn
just
peeping
out
of
the
ground
two
pairs
of
lively
bare
feet
came
flying
across
the
garden
patch
and
a
breathless
boy
and
girl
stood
beside
their
mother
they
were
a
sturdy
pair
of
the
boy
an
inch
or
more
taller
than
his
sister
and
both
with
the
blue
eyes
fair
skin
and
rosy
cheeks
which
proclaimed
their
english
blood
there
was
a
gleam
of
pride
in
goodwife
pepperell
eye
as
she
looked
a
her
children
but
not
for
the
world
would
she
have
let
them
see
it
much
less
would
she
have
owned
it
to
herself
for
she
was
a
puritan
mother
and
regarded
pride
of
any
kind
as
altogether
sinful
where
have
you
been
all
the
morning
she
said
you
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
the
corn
is
not
yet
high
enough
to
hide
you
i
was
hoeing
beyond
that
clump
of
bushes
said
daniel
pointing
to
a
group
of
high
blueberries
that
had
been
allowed
to
remain
in
the
cleared
field
and
i
was
keeping
away
the
crows
said
nancy
holding
out
her
wooden
clappers
only
i
fell
asleep
it
was
so
warm
i
just
could
help
it
so
shall
thy
poverty
come
as
one
that
travelleth
and
thy
want
as
an
armed
man
quoted
the
mother
sternly
night
is
the
time
for
sleep
go
now
and
eat
the
porridge
i
have
set
for
you
in
your
little
porringers
and
then
go
down
to
the
bay
with
this
basket
and
fill
it
with
clams
put
a
layer
of
seaweed
in
the
basket
first
and
pack
the
clams
in
that
they
will
keep
alive
for
some
time
if
you
bed
them
so
and
be
sure
to
bring
back
the
shovel
this
was
a
task
that
suited
the
twins
much
better
than
either
hoeing
corn
or
scaring
crows
and
they
ran
into
the
house
at
once
ate
their
porridge
with
more
haste
than
good
manners
and
dashed
joyfully
away
across
the
fields
toward
the
a
mile
away
they
followed
a
path
across
the
wide
stretch
of
pasture
where
wild
blackberry
vines
and
tall
blueberry
bushes
grew
then
through
a
strip
of
meadow
land
and
at
last
ran
out
on
the
bare
stretch
of
sand
and
weed
left
by
the
ebb
tide
toward
the
narrow
channel
cut
by
the
clear
water
of
the
charles
here
they
set
down
the
basket
and
began
looking
about
for
the
little
holes
which
betray
the
of
clams
illustration
oh
look
dan
cried
nancy
stopping
to
admire
the
long
line
of
which
they
had
left
behind
them
dost
see
what
a
pretty
border
we
have
made
is
just
like
a
pattern
she
walked
along
the
edge
of
the
stream
with
her
toes
turned
well
out
leaving
a
track
in
the
sand
like
this
illustration
then
the
delightful
flat
surface
tempted
her
to
further
exploits
she
picked
up
a
splinter
of
driftwood
and
making
a
wide
flourish
began
to
draw
a
picture
see
she
called
rapturously
to
dan
this
is
going
to
be
a
pig
here
his
nose
and
here
his
curly
tail
and
here
are
his
little
fat
legs
she
clapped
her
hands
with
admiration
now
i
shall
do
something
else
she
announced
as
she
finished
the
pig
with
a
round
red
pebble
stuck
in
for
the
eye
let
me
see
what
shall
i
draw
oh
i
know
a
picture
of
wattles
look
dan
she
made
a
careful
stroke
here
his
nose
and
here
his
chin
they
are
monstrous
near
together
because
he
has
nothing
but
gums
between
and
here
his
long
with
the
on
the
end
illustration
it
doth
bear
a
likeness
to
him
admitted
dan
laughing
in
spite
of
himself
but
sister
thou
shouldst
not
mock
him
he
is
an
old
man
and
we
should
pay
respect
to
gray
hairs
father
says
so
truly
i
have
as
much
of
respect
as
he
hath
of
hair
answered
naughty
nancy
his
poll
is
nearly
as
bald
as
an
egg
i
know
the
cause
of
thy
displeasure
declared
dan
wattles
poked
thee
for
bouncing
about
during
the
sermon
last
sunday
but
it
is
unseemly
to
bounce
in
the
and
besides
is
he
not
the
is
his
duty
to
see
that
people
behave
as
they
should
he
would
mayhap
have
bounced
himself
if
a
bee
had
been
buzzing
about
his
nose
as
it
did
about
mine
said
nancy
and
giving
a
vicious
dab
at
the
pictured
features
she
drew
a
bee
perched
on
the
end
of
wattles
nose
here
now
are
all
the
gray
hairs
he
hath
she
added
making
three
little
scratches
above
the
ear
nancy
pepperell
cried
her
brother
aghast
dost
thou
not
remember
what
happened
to
the
forty
and
two
children
that
said
up
thou
bald
head
to
elijah
it
would
be
no
marvel
if
bears
were
to
come
out
of
the
woods
this
moment
to
eat
thee
up
illustration
was
elijah
was
elisha
nancy
retorted
with
spirit
but
it
matters
little
whether
was
one
or
t
other
for
i
do
believe
two
bears
could
possibly
hold
so
much
and
besides
dost
thou
not
think
it
a
deal
worse
to
cause
a
bear
to
eat
up
forty
and
two
children
than
to
say
up
thou
bald
head
nancy
exclaimed
her
horrified
brother
glancing
fearfully
toward
the
forest
and
clapping
his
hand
on
her
mouth
to
prevent
further
impiety
thou
art
a
wicked
wicked
girl
dost
thou
not
know
that
the
eye
of
the
lord
is
in
every
place
without
doubt
his
ear
is
too
and
he
can
hear
every
word
thy
saucy
tongue
sayeth
come
let
us
rub
out
this
naughty
picture
quickly
and
mayhap
god
will
take
no
notice
this
time
he
ran
across
wattles
portrait
from
brow
to
chin
covering
it
with
besides
he
went
on
as
he
trotted
back
and
forth
thou
hast
broken
a
commandment
thou
hast
made
a
likeness
of
something
that
in
the
earth
and
that
wattles
nancy
thou
dost
take
fearful
chances
with
thy
soul
nancy
began
to
look
a
little
anxious
as
she
considered
her
conduct
at
any
rate
she
said
defensively
it
is
a
graven
image
and
i
have
neither
bowed
down
to
it
nor
served
it
i
do
try
to
be
good
dan
but
it
seemeth
that
the
devil
is
ever
at
my
elbow
illustration
is
because
thou
art
idle
said
dan
shaking
his
head
as
gravely
as
wattles
himself
busy
thyself
with
the
clams
and
satan
will
have
less
chance
at
thy
idle
hands
and
thy
idle
tongue
too
nancy
obediently
took
hold
of
the
basket
which
dan
thrust
into
her
hands
and
together
they
walked
for
some
distance
over
the
sandy
stretches
suddenly
a
tiny
stream
of
water
spouted
up
beside
feet
here
they
be
he
shouted
plunging
his
shovel
into
the
sand
and
what
big
ones
nancy
surveyed
the
clams
with
disfavor
they
were
thrusting
pale
thick
muscles
out
between
the
lobes
of
their
shells
they
look
as
if
they
were
sticking
out
their
tongues
at
us
said
nancy
as
she
picked
one
up
gingerly
and
dropped
it
into
the
basket
but
dan
mother
said
we
were
to
bed
them
in
seaweed
i
see
none
here
said
dan
leaning
on
his
shovel
and
looking
about
him
the
tide
hath
swept
everything
as
clean
as
a
floor
i
seek
for
some
while
thou
art
busy
with
the
digging
said
nancy
glad
to
escape
the
duty
of
picking
up
the
clams
and
off
she
trotted
without
another
word
the
flats
seamed
and
grooved
with
channels
where
pools
of
water
still
lingered
sloped
gently
down
to
the
lower
level
of
the
bay
and
farther
out
a
range
of
rocks
lifted
themselves
above
the
sandy
waste
illustration
i
surely
find
seaweed
on
the
rocks
thought
nancy
to
herself
as
she
sped
along
and
in
a
few
moments
she
had
reached
them
had
tossed
up
the
basket
and
was
climbing
their
rugged
sides
there
a
mort
o
seaweed
here
she
said
nodding
her
head
wisely
as
she
picked
up
a
long
string
of
kelp
i
can
fill
my
basket
in
no
time
at
all
there
was
no
need
for
haste
she
thought
so
she
sat
down
beside
a
pool
of
water
left
in
a
hollow
of
the
rocks
to
explore
its
contents
the
first
thing
she
found
was
a
group
of
tiny
barnacles
and
for
a
while
she
amused
herself
by
washing
salt
water
over
them
to
see
them
open
their
tiny
cups
of
shell
in
the
pool
itself
a
beautiful
was
floating
about
and
just
beyond
lay
a
clinging
to
a
bunch
of
seaweed
she
found
other
treasures
scattered
about
by
the
largess
of
the
tide
tiny
spiral
shells
stones
of
all
colors
and
a
horseshoe
crab
besides
seaweed
with
pretty
little
pods
which
popped
delightfully
when
she
squeezed
them
with
her
fingers
then
she
heard
the
cries
of
gulls
overhead
and
watched
them
as
they
wheeled
and
circled
between
her
and
the
sky
when
they
flew
out
to
sea
she
sat
with
her
hands
clasping
her
knees
and
gazed
across
the
bay
at
the
three
hills
of
boston
town
she
could
see
quite
plainly
the
tall
beacon
standing
like
a
ship
mast
on
top
of
beacon
hill
and
farther
north
she
strained
her
eyes
to
pick
out
governor
dwelling
from
the
cluster
of
houses
which
straggled
up
the
slope
of
copp
hill
and
which
made
all
there
was
of
the
city
of
boston
in
that
early
day
illustration
for
some
time
she
sat
there
hugging
her
knees
and
thinking
long
long
thoughts
and
it
was
not
until
the
sound
of
little
waves
lapping
against
the
rocks
roused
her
that
she
woke
from
her
day
dream
and
realized
with
terror
that
the
tide
had
turned
the
channels
and
lower
levels
of
the
bay
were
already
brimming
over
and
the
water
was
deep
about
the
rocks
on
which
she
perched
at
almost
the
same
moment
dan
had
been
surprised
by
a
cold
wave
which
washed
over
his
bare
feet
and
turning
about
was
dismayed
to
find
a
sheet
of
blue
water
covering
the
bay
and
to
see
nancy
standing
on
the
topmost
rock
shouting
dan
dan
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
for
one
astonished
instant
he
looked
at
her
then
throwing
down
his
shovel
he
plunged
unhesitatingly
into
the
icy
bath
and
now
nancy
realizing
that
there
was
not
a
moment
to
lose
if
she
hoped
to
reach
the
shore
in
safety
let
herself
slowly
down
off
the
rocks
leaving
the
basket
behind
her
and
started
toward
her
brother
the
water
was
already
so
deep
in
the
channels
that
their
progress
toward
each
other
was
slow
but
they
ploughed
bravely
on
feeling
the
bottom
carefully
at
each
step
lest
they
sink
in
some
or
hollow
washed
out
by
the
tide
some
distance
away
toward
charlestown
a
fishing
schooner
rocked
on
the
deeper
water
of
the
bay
and
a
fisherman
in
a
small
boat
attracted
by
the
shouting
looked
up
and
seeing
the
two
struggling
figures
instantly
bent
to
his
oars
and
started
toward
them
though
he
rowed
rapidly
it
was
some
minutes
before
he
could
reach
the
children
who
were
now
floundering
about
in
water
nearly
up
to
their
necks
illustration
hold
fast
to
my
shoulder
nancy
he
heard
dan
cry
i
can
float
and
i
can
swim
a
little
keep
thy
nose
above
water
and
let
thy
feet
go
where
they
will
nancy
spluttering
and
gurgling
was
trying
hard
to
follow
dan
directions
when
the
boat
shot
alongside
and
a
cheery
voice
cried
ahoy
there
come
aboard
you
young
porpoises
to
the
children
it
was
like
a
voice
straight
from
heaven
dan
immediately
helped
nancy
to
get
into
the
boat
and
then
she
balanced
it
while
he
climbed
aboard
when
they
were
safely
bestowed
among
the
with
which
the
boat
was
laden
the
man
leaned
on
his
oars
and
eyed
them
critically
short
of
sense
ai
ye
he
remarked
genially
nigh
about
drownded
that
time
or
i
no
skipper
if
ye
ai
bent
on
destruction
ye
better
get
into
dry
clothes
ye
as
wet
as
a
mess
of
drownded
kittens
tell
me
where
you
live
and
i
take
you
home
he
flung
a
tarpaulin
over
the
shivering
figures
and
tucked
it
around
them
as
he
scolded
is
all
my
fault
sobbed
poor
nancy
dan
came
in
just
to
get
me
out
very
commendable
of
him
i
sure
said
the
stranger
nodding
approvingly
at
dan
and
just
what
he
ought
to
do
and
doubtless
you
worth
saving
at
that
though
a
young
miss
i
never
see
in
all
my
days
she
went
to
find
seaweed
to
bed
the
clams
explained
dan
coming
to
his
sister
defense
and
the
tide
caught
her
thou
art
kind
indeed
to
pick
us
up
sir
oh
groaned
remorseful
nancy
her
teeth
chattering
it
all
because
i
such
a
sinner
i
made
a
likeness
of
wattles
in
the
sand
and
said
dreadful
things
about
the
prophet
elijah
or
mayhap
was
elisha
and
dan
said
a
bear
might
come
to
eat
me
up
just
like
the
forty
and
two
children
and
instead
of
a
bear
we
both
were
almost
swallowed
by
the
tide
well
now
said
the
stranger
comfortingly
ye
see
instead
of
sending
bears
the
lord
sent
me
along
to
fish
ye
out
just
the
same
as
he
sent
the
whale
to
swallow
jonah
when
he
was
acting
contrary
looks
like
he
meant
to
let
ye
off
with
a
scare
this
time
come
now
my
lass
there
salt
water
enough
aboard
and
if
ye
cry
into
the
boat
ye
have
to
bail
her
out
besides
he
added
whimsically
looking
up
at
the
sky
there
another
squall
coming
on
and
two
at
a
time
is
too
many
for
any
sailor
if
i
to
cast
you
up
on
the
shore
same
as
the
whale
ye
have
to
tell
me
which
way
to
go
and
who
ye
are
our
father
is
josiah
pepperell
answered
dan
and
our
house
is
almost
a
mile
back
from
shore
near
cambridge
so
you
josiah
pepperell
children
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
might
have
known
it
ye
do
favor
him
some
said
the
fisherman
well
well
the
ways
of
the
lord
are
surely
past
finding
out
why
i
knew
your
father
way
back
in
england
he
came
over
here
for
religion
and
i
came
for
fish
not
that
i
ai
a
man
he
added
hastily
noticing
a
look
of
horror
on
nancy
face
but
i
ai
so
pious
as
some
i
a
seafaring
man
captain
sanders
of
the
lucy
ann
marblehead
ye
can
see
her
riding
at
anchor
out
there
in
the
bay
i
have
set
eyes
on
your
father
since
he
left
boston
and
settled
in
the
back
woods
up
yonder
he
sent
the
boat
flying
through
the
water
with
swift
sure
strokes
as
he
talked
and
brought
it
ashore
at
the
first
they
found
here
they
drew
it
up
on
the
bank
and
taking
out
the
turned
it
upside
down
so
the
rain
would
not
fill
it
two
great
green
lobsters
with
eyes
were
hidden
away
under
the
pots
and
when
the
boat
was
overturned
they
tumbled
out
and
started
at
a
lively
pace
for
the
water
hi
there
shouted
the
captain
seizing
them
by
their
tails
where
are
your
manners
by
jolly
i
like
to
forgot
ye
come
along
now
and
take
supper
with
the
pepperells
i
invite
ye
they
short
of
clams
and
they
be
pleased
to
see
ye
or
i
miss
my
reckoning
there
were
pegs
stuck
in
the
claws
so
the
creatures
were
harmless
and
swinging
along
with
one
kicking
vigorously
in
each
hand
the
captain
plunged
into
the
long
meadow
grass
the
children
following
close
at
his
heels
the
clouds
grew
darker
and
darker
there
was
a
rumble
of
thunder
and
streaks
of
lightning
tore
great
rents
in
the
sky
as
they
hurried
across
the
open
meadow
and
struck
into
the
pasture
land
beyond
head
into
the
wind
there
and
keep
going
shouted
the
captain
as
the
children
struggled
along
impeded
by
their
wet
clothing
it
from
the
north
and
we
pointed
straight
into
it
past
bushes
waving
distractedly
in
the
wind
under
the
boughs
of
young
oak
trees
over
stones
and
through
briars
they
sped
and
at
last
they
came
in
sight
of
the
cabin
just
as
the
storm
broke
goodwife
pepperell
was
standing
in
the
door
gazing
anxiously
toward
the
river
when
they
dashed
out
of
the
bushes
and
scudding
past
her
stood
dripping
on
the
her
husband
was
just
hanging
his
gun
over
the
and
the
noise
of
their
entrance
was
drowned
out
by
a
clap
of
thunder
so
when
he
turned
about
and
saw
the
three
drenched
figures
it
was
no
wonder
that
for
an
instant
he
was
too
surprised
to
speak
well
of
all
things
he
said
at
last
holding
out
his
hand
to
captain
sanders
what
in
god
providence
brings
thee
here
thomas
thou
art
welcome
indeed
is
a
long
time
since
i
have
seen
thee
god
providence
ye
may
call
it
answered
the
captain
shaking
the
goodman
hand
as
if
he
were
pumping
out
the
hold
of
a
sinking
ship
and
i
not
gainsay
it
the
truth
is
i
overhauled
these
small
craft
floundering
around
in
the
with
water
over
their
scuppers
all
but
wrecked
so
i
took
in
tow
and
brought
ashore
their
mother
meanwhile
had
not
waited
for
explanations
seeing
how
chilled
they
were
she
had
hurried
the
children
to
the
loft
above
the
one
room
of
the
cabin
and
was
already
giving
them
a
and
getting
out
dry
clean
clothes
while
they
told
her
their
adventure
thank
god
you
are
safe
she
said
clasping
them
both
in
her
arms
when
the
tale
was
told
thank
captain
sanders
as
well
mother
said
daniel
had
it
not
been
for
him
i
doubt
if
we
could
have
reached
the
shore
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
then
said
the
goodwife
loosening
her
clasp
and
picking
up
the
wet
clothing
you
know
well
about
the
tide
nancy
child
why
art
thou
so
wild
and
reckless
thou
art
the
cause
of
much
anxiety
at
her
mother
reproof
gentle
though
it
was
poor
nancy
flopped
over
on
her
stomach
and
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
gave
way
to
tears
it
all
because
i
am
so
wicked
she
moaned
my
sins
are
as
scarlet
oh
mother
dost
think
god
will
cause
the
lightning
to
strike
us
dead
to
punish
me
she
shuddered
with
fear
as
a
flash
shone
through
the
chinks
of
the
logs
and
for
an
instant
lighted
the
dim
loft
her
mother
put
down
the
wet
clothes
and
lifting
her
little
daughter
tenderly
in
her
arms
laid
her
on
her
bed
god
maketh
the
rain
to
fall
on
both
the
just
and
the
unjust
she
said
soothingly
rest
here
while
i
go
down
and
get
supper
she
covered
her
warmly
with
a
homespun
blanket
and
accompanied
by
dan
made
her
way
down
the
ladder
she
found
her
husband
putting
fresh
logs
on
the
fire
and
stirring
the
coals
to
a
blaze
while
the
captain
hung
his
coat
on
the
corner
of
the
to
dry
she
went
up
to
him
and
held
out
her
hand
captain
sanders
she
said
but
for
thee
this
might
be
a
desolate
household
indeed
this
night
the
captain
red
face
turned
a
deeper
shade
and
he
fidgeted
with
embarrassment
as
he
took
her
hand
in
his
great
red
paw
then
dropped
it
suddenly
as
if
it
were
hot
oh
stow
it
stow
it
he
begged
that
is
i
mean
to
say
why
by
jolly
a
pirate
could
do
no
less
when
he
see
a
fine
bit
of
cargo
like
that
going
to
the
bottom
to
the
captain
great
relief
the
lobsters
at
this
moment
created
a
diversion
he
had
dropped
them
on
the
hearth
when
he
came
in
and
they
were
now
clattering
briskly
about
the
room
butting
into
anything
that
came
in
their
way
in
an
effort
to
escape
he
made
a
sudden
dash
after
them
and
held
them
out
toward
goodwife
pepperell
here
they
be
he
said
i
saved
them
for
my
supper
and
i
take
it
kindly
if
ye
cook
them
for
me
and
help
eat
them
too
it
raining
cats
and
dogs
and
if
i
was
to
start
out
now
i
have
a
hard
time
finding
the
lucy
ann
ye
ca
see
a
rod
ahead
of
ye
in
such
a
downpour
we
shall
be
glad
to
have
thee
stay
as
long
as
thou
wilt
said
the
goodwife
heartily
put
the
lobsters
in
this
while
i
set
the
kettle
to
boil
she
held
out
a
wooden
puncheon
as
she
spoke
and
the
captain
dropped
them
in
then
he
sat
down
with
goodman
pepperell
on
the
settle
beside
the
fireplace
and
the
two
men
talked
of
their
boyhood
in
england
while
she
hung
the
kettle
on
the
crane
over
the
fire
and
began
to
prepare
the
evening
meal
daniel
sit
thee
down
by
the
fire
and
get
a
good
bed
of
coals
ready
while
i
mix
the
she
said
as
she
stepped
briskly
about
the
room
and
daniel
nothing
loath
drew
a
stool
to
the
side
and
fed
the
fire
with
chips
and
while
he
listened
with
all
his
ears
to
the
talk
of
the
two
men
illustration
well
thomas
how
hast
thou
prospered
since
i
saw
thee
last
asked
goodman
pepperell
tolerable
tolerable
josiah
answered
the
captain
i
been
mining
for
sea
gold
daniel
wondered
what
in
the
world
sea
gold
might
be
ye
see
he
went
on
turning
to
include
daniel
in
the
conversation
my
father
was
a
sea
captain
before
me
and
my
too
why
my
helped
send
the
spanish
armada
to
the
bottom
where
it
belonged
many
and
many
the
time
i
heard
him
tell
about
it
and
i
judge
from
what
he
said
he
must
have
done
most
of
the
job
himself
though
i
reckon
old
drake
may
have
helped
some
here
the
captain
chuckled
he
never
came
back
from
his
last
voyage
overhauled
by
pirates
more
likely
that
was
twenty
years
ago
and
i
been
following
the
sea
myself
ever
since
i
was
wrecked
off
the
spanish
main
on
my
first
voyage
and
i
run
afoul
of
pirates
and
come
near
walking
the
plank
more
times
than
one
i
telling
ye
but
somehow
i
always
had
the
luck
to
get
away
and
here
i
be
safe
and
sound
at
this
point
the
lobsters
made
a
commotion
in
the
wooden
puncheon
and
the
captain
turned
his
attention
to
them
jest
spilin
to
get
out
ai
ye
he
inquired
genially
look
here
boy
to
daniel
that
water
bilin
heave
in
daniel
held
his
squirming
victims
over
the
pot
and
not
without
a
qualm
of
pity
dropped
them
into
the
boiling
water
then
he
ventured
to
ask
a
question
what
is
sea
gold
captain
sanders
things
like
them
answered
the
captain
jerking
his
thumb
at
the
lobsters
which
were
already
beginning
to
turn
a
beautiful
red
color
as
they
boiled
in
the
pot
as
good
gold
as
any
that
was
ever
dug
out
of
mines
ye
can
get
for
fish
and
there
never
was
such
fishing
in
all
the
seas
as
there
is
along
this
coast
my
my
i
seen
schools
of
cod
off
the
cape
making
a
solid
floor
of
fish
on
the
water
so
ye
could
walk
on
it
if
ye
were
so
minded
and
as
for
lobsters
i
caught
that
measured
six
and
seven
feet
long
farther
down
the
coast
there
are
oysters
so
big
one
of
will
make
a
square
meal
for
four
or
five
people
it
the
truth
i
telling
ye
goodman
pepperell
smiled
thomas
he
said
thou
hast
not
lost
thy
power
of
narration
captain
sanders
for
an
instant
looked
a
bit
dashed
then
he
said
well
believe
it
or
not
josiah
it
the
truth
for
all
that
why
talk
about
the
land
of
canaan
flowin
with
milk
and
honey
this
here
water
just
alive
with
money
any
boy
could
go
out
and
haul
up
a
shilling
on
his
own
hook
any
time
he
liked
daniel
his
eyes
shining
and
his
lips
parted
was
just
making
up
his
mind
that
he
would
rather
be
the
captain
of
a
than
anything
else
in
the
world
since
he
knew
he
could
be
a
pirate
when
his
mother
came
to
the
fireplace
with
a
layer
of
dough
spread
on
a
she
placed
the
board
in
a
slanting
position
against
an
iron
trivet
before
the
glowing
bed
of
coals
and
set
a
pot
of
beans
in
the
ashes
to
warm
keep
an
eye
on
that
she
said
to
daniel
and
do
let
it
burn
then
she
turned
away
to
set
the
table
illustration
this
task
took
but
little
time
for
in
those
days
there
were
few
things
to
put
on
it
she
spread
a
snowy
cloth
of
homespun
linen
on
the
plank
which
served
as
a
table
and
laid
a
knife
and
spoon
at
each
place
there
were
no
forks
and
for
plates
only
a
square
of
wood
with
a
shallow
depression
in
the
middle
beside
each
of
these
trenchers
she
placed
a
napkin
and
a
mug
and
at
the
captain
place
as
a
special
honor
she
set
a
beautiful
tankard
of
wrought
silver
it
was
one
of
the
few
valuable
things
she
had
brought
with
her
from
her
english
home
and
it
was
used
only
on
great
occasions
when
these
preparations
were
complete
she
took
the
lobsters
from
the
pot
poured
the
beans
into
a
pewter
dish
heaped
the
golden
high
upon
a
trencher
and
sending
dan
to
fetch
nancy
called
the
men
to
supper
the
storm
was
over
by
this
time
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
were
throwing
long
shadows
over
the
fields
and
the
robins
were
singing
their
evening
song
the
goodwife
stepped
to
the
window
and
threw
open
the
wooden
shutters
see
she
said
there
a
rainbow
the
sign
of
promise
murmured
goodman
pepperell
rising
and
looking
over
his
wife
shoulder
fine
day
said
the
captain
maybe
i
can
plant
my
after
all
nancy
looking
pale
and
a
little
subdued
crept
down
the
ladder
and
took
her
place
with
daniel
at
the
foot
of
the
board
then
they
all
stood
while
goodman
pepperell
asked
a
blessing
on
the
food
and
thanked
god
for
his
mercy
in
delivering
them
from
danger
and
bringing
them
together
in
health
and
safety
to
partake
of
his
bounty
illustration
ii
two
days
the
grace
finished
it
was
a
very
long
one
and
the
beans
were
nearly
cold
before
he
said
amen
goodman
pepperell
broke
open
the
lobsters
and
piled
the
trenchers
with
and
beans
and
the
whole
family
fell
to
with
a
right
good
will
all
but
nancy
she
was
still
a
bit
upset
and
did
not
feel
hungry
thou
hast
not
told
me
captain
what
voyage
thou
art
about
to
undertake
next
said
the
goodman
sucking
a
with
relish
the
captain
loved
to
talk
quite
as
well
as
he
loved
to
eat
but
his
mouth
was
full
at
this
moment
and
he
paused
before
replying
i
getting
too
old
for
long
voyages
josiah
he
said
at
last
with
a
sigh
kind
o
losing
my
taste
for
adventure
pirates
is
pretty
plentiful
yet
and
for
all
i
a
sailor
i
like
to
die
in
my
bed
so
i
have
settled
at
marblehead
they
partial
to
fishermen
along
this
coast
the
town
gives
land
for
drying
their
fish
and
exempts
from
military
dooty
but
i
ca
stay
ashore
a
great
while
before
my
sea
legs
begin
to
hanker
for
the
feel
of
the
deck
rolling
under
so
i
doing
a
coasting
trade
all
up
and
down
the
length
of
massachusetts
bay
i
keep
a
parcel
of
going
some
here
and
some
plymouth
way
and
sell
them
and
fish
besides
doing
a
carrying
trade
for
all
the
towns
it
a
tame
kind
life
there
now
he
finished
that
all
there
is
to
say
about
me
and
i
just
take
a
turn
at
these
beans
and
give
ye
a
chance
to
tell
about
yourself
josiah
is
but
a
short
tale
answered
the
goodman
god
hath
prospered
me
i
have
an
hundred
acres
of
good
farm
land
along
this
river
and
i
have
a
cow
and
a
flock
of
sheep
to
keep
us
in
wool
for
the
good
wife
to
spin
i
have
set
out
apple
trees
and
there
is
wood
for
the
cutting
the
forest
furnishes
game
and
the
sea
is
stored
with
food
for
our
use
but
the
truth
is
there
is
more
to
do
than
can
be
compassed
with
one
pair
of
hands
the
neighbors
help
each
other
with
clearing
the
land
building
walls
and
such
as
that
but
if
this
country
is
to
be
developed
we
must
do
more
than
make
a
living
there
are
a
thousand
things
calling
to
be
done
if
there
were
but
the
men
to
do
them
the
captain
skillfully
balanced
a
mouthful
of
beans
on
his
knife
as
he
considered
the
problem
finally
he
said
well
here
and
judging
by
the
way
he
waded
right
into
the
tide
after
his
sister
i
calculate
he
be
a
smart
boy
to
have
round
he
is
said
the
goodman
and
daniel
blushed
to
his
eyes
for
his
father
seldom
praised
him
but
he
is
not
yet
equal
to
a
man
work
and
moreover
i
want
him
to
get
some
schooling
the
reverend
john
harvard
hath
promised
his
library
and
quite
a
sum
of
money
to
found
a
college
for
the
training
of
ministers
right
here
in
cambridge
the
hand
of
the
lord
hath
surely
guided
us
to
this
place
where
he
may
receive
an
education
and
it
may
even
be
that
daniel
will
be
a
minister
for
the
colony
sorely
needs
such
there
now
said
the
captain
farming
ai
such
plain
sailing
is
it
have
ye
thought
of
getting
an
indian
slave
to
help
ye
truly
i
have
thought
of
that
said
the
goodman
but
they
are
a
treacherous
lot
and
passing
lazy
there
was
a
parcel
of
pequot
women
and
girls
brought
up
from
beyond
plymouth
way
last
year
after
the
uprising
the
settlers
had
killed
off
all
the
men
and
sold
the
boys
in
the
bermudas
i
might
have
bought
one
of
the
women
but
i
need
a
man
or
at
least
a
boy
that
will
grow
into
one
the
pequots
are
about
all
gone
now
but
the
narragansetts
are
none
too
friendly
they
helped
fight
the
pequots
because
they
hate
them
worse
than
they
hate
the
english
but
they
are
only
biding
their
time
and
some
day
it
likely
we
shall
have
trouble
with
them
nay
i
could
never
trust
an
indian
slave
roger
williams
saith
they
are
wolves
with
men
brains
and
he
speaks
the
truth
well
then
said
the
captain
why
do
ye
get
a
black
they
are
more
docile
than
indians
and
the
woods
about
are
not
full
of
their
friends
aye
agreed
the
goodman
the
plan
is
a
good
one
and
well
thought
out
but
they
are
hard
to
come
by
there
are
only
a
few
even
in
boston
there
will
soon
be
more
i
thinking
said
the
captain
a
ship
was
built
in
marblehead
last
year
on
purpose
for
the
trade
captain
pierce
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
he
due
at
providence
any
time
now
with
a
cargo
of
blacks
from
guinea
ye
could
sail
down
the
bay
with
me
and
there
a
trail
across
the
neck
of
the
cape
to
providence
where
the
desire
will
come
to
port
i
expect
to
spend
the
sabbath
here
but
i
lift
anchor
on
monday
ye
can
tell
captain
pierce
ye
a
friend
of
mine
and
will
do
ye
no
harm
illustration
oh
father
breathed
dan
may
i
go
too
the
captain
chuckled
art
struck
with
the
sea
fever
son
he
said
looking
down
into
the
boy
eager
face
well
there
room
aboard
i
might
take
ye
along
if
so
be
thy
parents
are
willing
and
thou
art
minded
to
see
a
bit
of
the
world
up
to
this
time
goodwife
pepperell
had
said
no
word
but
now
she
spoke
are
there
not
dangers
enough
on
land
without
courting
the
dangers
of
the
sea
she
asked
her
husband
looked
at
her
with
gentle
disapproval
hold
thy
peace
he
said
what
hath
a
pioneer
lad
to
do
with
fear
moreover
if
he
goes
i
shall
be
with
him
nancy
leaned
forward
and
gazed
imploringly
at
the
captain
dost
thou
not
need
some
one
to
cook
on
thy
boat
she
gasped
i
know
well
how
to
make
and
i
then
seeing
her
father
stern
look
and
her
mother
distress
she
wilted
like
a
flower
on
its
stem
and
was
silent
the
captain
smiled
at
her
ye
a
fine
cook
i
make
no
doubt
he
said
genially
but
ye
would
go
and
leave
mother
here
all
alone
now
i
be
bound
nay
said
nancy
faintly
looking
at
her
mother
then
the
goodwife
spoke
it
pains
me
she
said
to
think
of
children
torn
from
their
parents
and
sold
into
slavery
even
though
they
be
but
indians
or
blacks
i
doubt
not
they
have
souls
like
ourselves
read
thy
bible
susanna
answered
her
husband
cursed
be
canaan
a
servant
of
servants
shall
he
be
unto
his
brethren
thus
say
the
scriptures
well
now
broke
in
the
captain
if
they
have
souls
they
either
got
to
save
or
lose
as
i
jedge
it
and
if
they
never
have
a
chance
to
hear
the
plan
of
salvation
they
bound
to
be
lost
anyway
bringin
over
here
gives
them
their
only
chance
to
escape
damnation
according
to
my
notion
hast
thou
ever
brought
over
a
cargo
of
slaves
thyself
asked
the
goodwife
nay
admitted
the
captain
but
i
sailed
once
on
a
slaver
and
i
own
i
liked
not
to
see
the
poor
critters
when
they
were
lured
away
it
seemed
they
could
rightly
sense
that
was
for
their
eternal
welfare
and
i
never
felt
called
to
set
their
feet
in
the
way
of
salvation
by
that
means
myself
i
reckon
i
not
more
than
if
ye
come
to
that
the
meal
was
now
over
the
dusk
had
deepened
as
they
lingered
about
the
table
and
goodwife
pepperell
rose
to
light
a
bayberry
candle
and
set
it
on
the
sit
ye
down
by
the
fire
again
while
nancy
and
i
wash
the
dishes
she
said
cordially
thank
ye
kindly
said
the
captain
but
i
must
budge
along
it
near
dark
and
timothy
that
my
mate
will
be
wondering
if
i
been
et
up
by
a
shark
it
going
to
be
a
clear
night
after
the
storm
the
children
slept
so
soundly
after
the
adventures
of
the
day
that
their
mother
called
them
three
times
from
the
foot
of
the
ladder
in
the
early
dawn
of
the
following
morning
without
getting
any
response
then
she
mounted
to
the
loft
and
shook
daniel
gently
wake
thee
she
said
is
long
past
and
saturday
at
that
daniel
opened
his
eyes
feebly
and
was
off
to
sleep
again
at
once
daniel
she
said
shaking
him
harder
thy
father
is
minded
to
take
thee
to
plymouth
before
the
words
were
fairly
out
of
her
mouth
daniel
had
popped
out
of
bed
as
if
he
had
been
shot
from
a
gun
oh
mother
he
shouted
am
i
really
to
go
shall
i
go
clear
to
providence
doth
captain
sanders
know
when
do
we
start
thy
father
arranged
it
with
the
captain
last
night
answered
his
mother
he
will
come
for
thee
in
the
little
boat
on
monday
morning
and
will
row
thee
and
thy
father
to
the
sloop
which
will
sail
at
high
tide
while
thy
father
makes
the
journey
across
the
cape
thou
wilt
go
on
to
provincetown
with
the
captain
or
mayhap
if
visitors
are
now
permitted
in
the
colony
my
aunt
the
governor
lady
will
keep
thee
with
her
until
thy
father
returns
she
would
like
well
to
see
my
son
i
know
and
i
trust
thou
wilt
be
a
good
lad
and
mind
thy
manners
come
nancy
child
i
need
thy
help
then
she
disappeared
down
the
ladder
to
stir
the
hasty
pudding
which
was
already
bubbling
in
the
pot
when
she
was
gone
nancy
flung
herself
upon
the
mattress
and
buried
her
face
in
the
oh
daniel
she
cried
smothering
a
sob
what
if
the
should
get
thee
daniel
was
at
her
side
in
an
instant
give
thyself
no
concern
about
pirates
sister
he
said
patting
her
comfortingly
i
have
thought
how
to
deal
with
them
i
shall
stand
by
the
rail
with
my
cutlass
in
my
hand
and
when
they
seek
to
board
her
i
will
bring
down
my
cutlass
so
here
he
made
a
terrific
sweep
with
his
arm
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
them
oh
breathed
nancy
much
impressed
how
brave
thou
art
well
said
daniel
modestly
there
be
the
captain
and
father
to
help
of
course
and
i
suppose
the
mate
too
there
will
be
four
of
us
men
anyway
it
was
their
father
voice
this
time
and
the
two
children
jumped
guiltily
and
began
to
dress
as
if
the
house
were
on
fire
and
they
had
but
two
minutes
to
escape
in
a
surprisingly
short
time
they
were
downstairs
and
attending
to
their
morning
tasks
nancy
looking
very
solemn
fed
the
chickens
and
dan
brought
water
from
the
spring
while
their
father
milked
the
cow
and
by
six
their
breakfast
of
hasty
pudding
and
milk
had
been
eaten
prayers
were
over
and
the
whole
family
was
ready
for
the
real
work
of
the
day
there
was
a
great
deal
of
it
to
do
for
nothing
but
works
of
necessity
and
mercy
could
be
performed
on
the
sabbath
the
sabbath
began
at
sundown
saturday
afternoon
and
the
travellers
were
to
make
an
early
start
on
monday
morning
a
fire
was
built
in
the
brick
oven
beside
the
fireplace
and
while
it
was
heating
the
goodwife
made
four
pies
and
six
loaves
of
and
prepared
a
pot
of
pork
and
beans
for
baking
illustration
when
the
coals
had
been
raked
out
and
the
oven
filled
she
washed
clothes
for
daniel
and
his
father
while
nancy
hurried
to
finish
a
pair
of
stockings
she
was
knitting
for
her
brother
daniel
himself
meanwhile
had
gone
down
to
the
bay
to
see
if
he
could
find
the
shovel
and
the
basket
he
came
home
in
triumph
about
noon
with
both
and
with
quite
a
number
of
clams
beside
which
the
goodwife
cooked
for
their
dinner
when
they
were
seated
at
the
table
and
the
goodman
had
asked
the
blessing
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
surveyed
the
ceiling
of
the
cabin
from
the
rafters
there
hung
long
festoons
of
dried
pumpkin
and
golden
ears
of
corn
there
were
also
sausages
hams
and
sides
of
bacon
i
doubt
not
you
will
fare
well
while
we
are
gone
he
said
there
is
plenty
of
meat
and
meal
enough
ground
to
last
for
some
time
the
planting
is
done
and
the
corn
well
hoed
there
is
wood
cut
and
wattles
will
call
upon
you
if
he
knows
i
am
away
i
am
leaving
the
for
thee
wife
the
musket
i
shall
take
with
me
why
must
wattles
come
interrupted
nancy
in
alarm
i
am
sure
mother
and
i
do
not
need
him
children
should
be
seen
and
not
heard
said
her
father
it
is
wattles
duty
to
oversee
the
congregation
at
home
as
well
as
in
the
nancy
looked
at
her
trencher
and
said
no
more
but
she
thought
there
was
already
enough
to
bear
without
having
wattles
added
to
her
troubles
daniel
meanwhile
had
attacked
his
porringer
of
clams
and
in
his
excitement
over
the
journey
was
gobbling
at
a
fearful
rate
his
mother
looked
at
him
despairingly
daniel
she
said
thou
art
pitching
food
into
thy
mouth
as
if
thou
wert
shoveling
coals
into
the
oven
take
thy
elbows
off
the
table
and
eat
more
moderately
daniel
glued
his
elbows
to
his
side
sit
up
straight
she
went
on
or
thou
wilt
grow
up
as
crooked
as
a
horn
daniel
immediately
sat
up
as
if
he
had
swallowed
the
poker
i
wish
thee
to
practice
proper
manners
at
home
lest
my
aunt
should
think
thee
a
person
of
no
gentility
remember
thou
must
not
ask
for
anything
at
the
table
wait
until
it
is
offered
thee
and
then
do
not
stuff
it
down
as
if
thine
eyes
had
not
looked
upon
food
for
a
fortnight
but
protested
poor
dan
who
was
beginning
to
feel
that
the
journey
might
not
be
all
his
fancy
had
painted
suppose
they
should
offer
it
i
do
not
fear
starvation
for
thee
his
mother
answered
briefly
and
oh
daniel
i
beg
of
thee
to
wash
thy
hands
before
going
to
the
table
the
governor
is
a
proper
man
and
my
aunt
is
very
particular
she
paused
for
breath
and
to
get
more
for
the
table
when
she
sat
down
again
daniel
said
if
you
please
i
think
i
rather
go
on
to
provincetown
with
the
captain
that
must
be
as
we
are
guided
at
the
time
said
his
father
the
busy
day
passed
quickly
and
before
sunset
a
fine
array
of
pies
and
brown
loaves
were
cooling
on
the
table
the
chores
were
done
and
a
sabbath
quiet
had
settled
down
over
the
household
not
to
be
broken
until
sunset
of
the
following
day
when
daniel
opened
the
cabin
door
the
next
morning
he
was
confronted
by
a
wall
of
gray
mist
which
shut
the
landscape
entirely
from
view
he
had
hoped
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
lucy
ann
in
order
to
assure
himself
that
he
had
not
merely
dreamed
the
events
of
the
day
before
but
nothing
could
he
see
and
he
began
dispirited
preparations
for
church
they
had
no
clock
and
on
account
of
the
fog
they
could
not
tell
the
time
by
the
sun
so
the
whole
family
started
early
to
cross
the
long
stretch
of
pasture
land
which
lay
between
them
and
the
in
the
village
they
reached
it
just
as
wattles
looking
very
grave
and
important
came
out
on
the
church
steps
and
beat
a
solemn
tattoo
upon
a
drum
to
call
the
people
together
they
came
from
different
directions
across
the
fields
and
through
the
one
street
of
the
village
looking
anxious
for
fear
they
should
be
late
yet
not
daring
to
desecrate
the
sabbath
by
any
appearance
of
haste
among
the
rest
and
short
of
wind
who
should
appear
but
captain
sanders
sabbath
decorum
forbade
any
show
of
surprise
so
goodman
pepperell
and
his
wife
merely
bowed
gravely
and
the
captain
looking
fairly
in
his
effort
to
keep
properly
solemn
nodded
in
return
and
they
passed
into
the
together
the
captain
sat
down
with
the
goodman
on
the
men
side
of
the
room
while
daniel
went
to
his
place
among
the
boys
leaving
nancy
and
his
mother
seated
with
the
women
on
the
opposite
side
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
a
boy
could
sit
through
a
sermon
two
hours
long
with
his
friends
all
about
him
and
such
a
secret
buttoned
up
inside
his
jacket
without
an
explosion
but
daniel
did
it
he
did
dare
do
otherwise
for
wattles
ranged
up
and
down
the
little
aisle
with
his
in
hand
on
the
lookout
for
once
indeed
during
the
sermon
there
was
a
low
rumbling
snore
and
daniel
was
horrified
to
see
wattles
lean
over
and
gently
tickle
the
captain
nose
with
the
the
captain
woke
with
a
start
and
sneezed
so
violently
that
the
boy
next
daniel
all
but
tittered
outright
wattles
immediately
gave
him
a
smart
rap
on
the
head
with
the
knob
end
of
his
stick
so
it
is
no
wonder
that
after
that
daniel
sat
with
his
eyes
nearly
crossed
in
his
effort
to
keep
them
fixed
on
the
minister
though
his
thoughts
were
far
away
ranging
massachusetts
bay
with
the
lucy
ann
of
marblehead
at
last
however
the
sermon
ended
the
final
psalm
was
sung
and
after
the
benediction
the
minister
passed
out
of
the
church
and
the
congregation
dispersed
to
eat
a
bite
of
in
the
before
assembling
again
for
another
sermon
the
sun
was
now
shining
brightly
and
once
outside
the
door
after
the
first
sermon
the
captain
wiped
his
brow
as
if
exhausted
and
a
few
moments
later
daniel
saw
him
quietly
disappearing
in
the
direction
of
the
river
he
was
not
of
the
cambridge
parish
so
no
discipline
could
be
exercised
upon
him
but
wattles
set
him
down
at
once
as
a
dangerous
character
and
even
goodwife
pepperell
shook
her
head
gently
when
she
noted
his
absence
illustration
somehow
although
it
was
a
breach
of
sabbath
decorum
to
tell
it
the
great
news
leaked
out
during
the
intermission
and
daniel
was
the
center
of
interest
to
every
boy
in
the
congregation
during
the
afternoon
when
the
second
long
sermon
was
over
and
the
exhausted
minister
had
trailed
solemnly
down
the
aisle
the
equally
exhausted
people
walked
sedately
to
their
houses
discussing
the
sermon
as
they
went
all
that
day
daniel
kept
a
tight
clutch
on
his
manners
but
the
moment
the
sun
went
down
he
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
turned
three
somersaults
and
a
handspring
behind
the
cabin
to
limber
himself
up
after
the
fearful
strain
illustration
iii
on
board
the
lucy
ann
the
family
rose
at
daybreak
the
next
morning
tasks
were
quickly
performed
and
after
breakfast
the
goodman
read
a
chapter
in
the
bible
and
prayed
long
and
earnestly
that
god
would
bless
their
journey
protect
those
who
were
left
behind
and
bring
them
all
together
again
in
safety
then
he
and
daniel
started
down
the
path
to
the
river
with
nancy
and
her
mother
both
looking
very
serious
following
after
the
tide
was
already
coming
in
and
the
bay
stretched
before
them
a
wide
sheet
of
blue
water
sparkling
in
the
sun
in
the
distance
they
could
see
the
sails
of
the
lucy
ann
being
hoisted
and
captain
sanders
in
his
small
boat
rowing
rapidly
toward
the
ship
ahoy
shouted
daniel
waving
his
cap
as
the
boat
approached
ahoy
there
answered
the
captain
and
in
a
moment
the
keel
grated
on
the
sand
and
the
goodman
turned
to
his
wife
and
daughter
the
lord
watch
between
me
and
thee
while
we
are
absent
one
from
the
other
he
said
reverently
and
amen
boomed
the
captain
then
there
were
kisses
and
and
soon
nancy
and
her
mother
were
alone
on
the
shore
waving
their
hands
until
the
boat
was
a
mere
speck
on
the
dancing
blue
waters
as
it
neared
the
lucy
ann
they
went
back
to
the
cabin
and
there
they
watched
the
white
sails
gleaming
in
the
sun
until
they
disappeared
around
a
headland
come
nancy
said
her
mother
when
the
ship
was
quite
out
of
sight
idleness
will
only
make
loneliness
harder
to
bear
here
is
a
task
for
thee
she
handed
her
a
basket
of
raw
wool
take
this
and
card
it
for
me
to
spin
nancy
hated
carding
with
all
her
heart
but
she
rose
obediently
brought
the
basket
to
the
doorway
and
sitting
down
in
the
sunshine
patiently
carded
the
wool
into
little
wisps
ready
to
be
wound
on
a
spindle
and
spun
into
yarn
by
the
mother
skillful
hands
meanwhile
daniel
was
standing
on
the
deck
of
the
lucy
ann
drinking
in
the
fresh
salt
breeze
and
eagerly
watching
the
shores
as
the
boat
passed
between
charlestown
and
boston
and
dropped
anchor
in
the
harbor
to
set
the
captain
all
the
wonderful
bright
day
they
sailed
past
rocky
islands
and
picturesque
headlands
with
the
captain
at
the
tiller
skillfully
keeping
the
vessel
to
the
course
and
at
the
same
time
spinning
yarns
to
daniel
and
his
father
about
the
adventures
which
had
overtaken
him
at
various
points
along
the
coast
at
governor
island
he
had
caught
a
giant
lobster
he
had
been
all
but
wrecked
in
a
fog
off
thompson
island
ye
see
that
point
of
land
he
said
waving
his
hand
toward
a
rocky
promontory
extending
far
out
into
the
bay
that
squantum
miles
standish
of
plymouth
named
it
that
after
an
indian
that
was
a
good
friend
of
the
colony
in
the
early
days
well
right
off
there
i
was
overhauled
by
a
french
privateer
once
is
a
polite
name
for
a
pirate
ship
she
was
loaded
with
molasses
indigo
and
such
from
the
west
indies
and
i
had
a
cargo
of
if
it
had
been
that
her
sailors
was
mostly
roarin
drunk
at
the
time
it
likely
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
thomas
sanders
skipper
sloop
and
all
but
my
boat
was
smaller
and
quicker
than
theirs
and
knowing
these
waters
so
well
i
was
able
to
give
the
slip
and
get
out
into
open
sea
and
here
i
be
ah
those
were
the
days
the
captain
heaved
a
heavy
sigh
for
the
lost
joys
of
youth
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
his
eyes
twinkled
and
he
began
another
story
one
day
as
we
was
skirtin
the
shores
of
martha
vineyard
he
said
we
were
followed
by
a
shark
now
there
nothing
a
sailor
hates
worse
than
a
shark
and
for
good
reasons
they
the
pirates
of
the
deep
that
what
they
are
they
follow
a
vessel
for
days
snapping
up
whatever
the
cook
throws
out
and
hoping
somebody
fall
overboard
to
give
a
full
meal
well
sir
there
was
a
sailor
aboard
on
that
voyage
that
had
a
special
grudge
against
sharks
he
been
all
but
et
up
by
one
once
and
he
allowed
this
was
his
chance
to
get
even
so
he
let
out
a
hook
baited
with
a
whole
pound
of
salt
pork
and
the
shark
gobbled
it
down
instanter
hook
and
all
they
hauled
him
up
the
ship
side
and
then
that
sailor
let
himself
down
over
the
rails
by
a
rope
and
cut
a
hole
in
the
shark
gullet
or
whatever
they
call
the
pouch
the
critter
carries
his
supplies
in
and
took
out
the
pork
then
he
dropped
him
back
in
the
water
and
threw
the
pork
in
after
him
well
sir
believe
it
or
not
that
shark
sighted
the
pork
bobbing
round
in
the
water
so
he
swallowed
it
again
of
course
it
dropped
right
out
through
the
hole
in
his
gullet
and
by
jolly
as
long
as
we
could
see
him
that
shark
was
continuing
to
swallow
that
piece
of
pork
over
and
over
again
i
do
know
as
i
ever
see
any
animal
get
more
pleasure
out
of
his
rations
than
that
shark
got
out
of
that
pound
of
pork
i
believe
in
bein
kind
to
dumb
critters
he
finished
and
i
reckon
the
shark
is
about
the
dumbdest
there
is
anyhow
that
one
surely
did
die
happy
here
the
captain
solemnly
winked
his
eye
what
became
of
the
sailor
asked
dan
that
sailor
was
me
admitted
the
captain
that
what
became
of
him
and
served
him
right
too
they
slept
that
night
on
the
deck
of
the
sloop
and
before
light
the
next
morning
dan
was
awakened
by
the
groaning
of
the
chain
as
the
anchor
was
hauled
up
and
the
flapping
of
the
sails
as
timothy
hoisted
them
to
catch
a
stiff
breeze
which
was
blowing
from
the
northeast
the
second
day
passed
like
the
first
the
weather
was
fine
the
winds
favorable
and
that
evening
they
rounded
duxbury
point
and
entered
plymouth
bay
just
as
the
sun
sank
behind
the
hills
back
of
the
town
here
the
spot
where
the
mayflower
dropped
anchor
said
the
captain
as
the
sloop
approached
a
strip
of
sandy
beach
stretching
like
a
long
finger
into
the
water
i
generally
bring
the
lucy
ann
to
at
the
same
place
she
ca
go
out
again
till
high
tide
for
the
harbor
is
shallow
and
we
likely
run
aground
so
ye
have
the
whole
morning
to
spend
with
your
relations
and
that
more
than
i
want
to
spend
with
some
of
mine
i
telling
ye
and
he
roared
with
laughter
relations
is
like
victuals
he
went
on
some
agrees
with
ye
and
some
do
our
relations
are
the
bradfords
said
goodman
pepperell
with
dignity
and
a
better
man
than
the
governor
never
trod
said
the
captain
heartily
he
and
captain
standish
and
brewster
and
edward
winslow
why
those
four
men
have
piloted
this
town
through
more
squalls
than
would
overtake
most
places
in
a
hundred
years
if
anything
could
kill
they
would
have
been
under
ground
years
ago
they
had
starvation
and
indians
and
the
plague
followin
after
like
a
school
of
sharks
ever
since
they
dropped
anchor
here
well
nigh
on
to
twenty
years
ago
and
whatever
happens
they
just
thank
the
lord
as
if
was
a
special
blessing
and
go
right
along
by
jolly
declared
the
captain
blowing
his
nose
violently
they
nigh
about
beat
old
job
for
patience
he
slay
me
yet
will
i
trust
in
him
says
old
job
but
his
troubles
was
all
over
after
a
bit
and
he
got
rewarded
with
another
full
set
of
wives
and
children
and
worldly
goods
so
he
could
see
plain
as
print
that
righteousness
paid
but
these
men
their
reward
for
trouble
is
just
more
trouble
fer
i
can
see
they
surely
do
beat
all
for
piety
the
lord
loveth
he
chasteneth
quoted
the
goodman
the
lord
must
be
mighty
partial
to
plymouth
then
answered
the
captain
as
he
brought
the
sloop
gently
round
the
point
for
she
been
shown
enough
favor
to
spile
her
according
to
my
way
of
thinkin
illustration
it
was
too
late
to
go
ashore
that
night
and
from
the
deck
dan
watched
the
stars
come
out
over
the
little
village
not
dreaming
that
it
held
in
its
humble
keeping
the
brave
spirit
of
a
great
nation
that
was
to
be
when
daniel
opened
his
eyes
next
morning
his
father
and
the
captain
were
already
stowing
various
packages
in
the
small
boat
and
from
the
tiny
forecastle
came
an
appetizing
smell
of
frying
fish
here
ye
be
said
the
captain
cheerily
to
dan
bright
as
a
new
shilling
and
ready
to
eat
i
be
bound
as
soon
as
we
had
a
bite
we
go
ashore
i
got
to
row
clear
over
to
duxbury
after
i
do
my
errands
in
plymouth
but
i
hunt
ye
up
when
i
get
back
nobody
can
get
lost
in
this
town
without
he
goes
out
of
it
i
could
spot
ye
from
the
deck
most
anywhere
on
the
map
then
my
lad
if
your
father
says
the
word
i
bring
ye
back
to
the
lucy
ann
while
he
goes
across
the
neck
ye
get
a
taste
of
if
ye
come
along
o
me
ye
can
make
yourself
handy
on
deck
and
keep
a
quarter
of
your
own
catch
for
yourself
if
you
lively
a
tub
of
salt
fish
would
be
a
tidy
present
to
your
mother
when
you
get
back
home
oh
i
want
to
go
with
you
cried
daniel
remembering
with
terror
what
was
expected
of
him
in
the
way
of
manners
should
he
be
invited
to
stay
at
the
governor
he
looked
questioningly
at
his
father
but
was
answered
only
by
a
grave
smile
and
he
knew
better
than
to
plead
here
now
cried
the
captain
as
timothy
appeared
with
a
big
trencher
of
smoking
fish
and
corn
bread
tie
up
to
the
dock
and
stow
away
some
of
this
cargo
in
your
insides
neither
daniel
nor
his
father
needed
a
second
invitation
for
the
keen
salt
air
had
given
them
the
appetite
of
wolves
and
the
breakfast
was
soon
disposed
of
according
to
directions
then
the
two
followed
the
captain
over
the
side
and
into
the
boat
which
had
been
lowered
and
was
now
bobbing
about
on
the
choppy
waves
of
the
bay
when
they
were
settled
and
the
boat
was
properly
trimmed
the
captain
rowed
toward
a
small
stream
of
clear
water
which
flowed
down
from
the
hills
back
of
the
town
and
landed
them
at
the
foot
of
the
one
little
street
of
the
village
the
captain
drew
the
boat
well
up
on
the
shore
and
stowed
letters
and
parcels
in
various
places
about
his
person
and
the
three
started
up
the
hill
together
they
had
not
gone
far
when
a
childish
voice
shouted
there
captain
sanders
and
immediately
every
child
within
hearing
came
tumbling
down
the
hill
till
they
swarmed
about
him
like
flies
about
a
illustration
pirates
cried
the
captain
holding
up
his
hands
in
mock
terror
i
surrender
come
aboard
and
seize
the
cargo
he
held
open
the
capacious
pocket
which
hung
from
his
belt
and
immediately
half
a
dozen
small
hands
plunged
into
it
and
came
out
laden
with
raisins
here
now
divide
fairly
shouted
the
captain
no
pigs
and
with
children
clinging
to
his
hands
and
he
made
a
slow
progress
up
the
hill
daniel
and
his
father
following
closely
in
his
wake
as
they
were
nearing
the
common
house
two
more
children
caught
sight
of
him
and
came
racing
to
meet
him
the
captain
dived
into
his
pocket
for
more
raisins
and
found
it
empty
but
he
was
equal
to
the
emergency
here
you
mercy
and
joseph
bradford
he
cried
i
brought
you
something
i
have
brought
to
any
one
else
i
brought
you
a
new
cousin
the
other
children
had
been
so
absorbed
in
their
old
friend
they
had
scarcely
noticed
the
strangers
hitherto
but
now
they
turned
to
gaze
curiously
at
daniel
and
his
father
joseph
and
mercy
were
both
a
little
younger
than
daniel
and
all
three
were
shy
but
no
one
could
stay
shy
long
when
the
captain
was
about
and
soon
they
were
walking
along
together
in
the
friendliest
manner
where
thy
father
young
man
said
the
captain
speaking
to
joseph
i
have
a
letter
for
him
and
i
have
brought
a
relation
for
him
too
i
wish
you
would
bring
me
a
cousin
said
one
little
girl
enviously
well
now
roared
the
captain
think
of
that
i
have
a
few
relations
of
my
own
left
over
that
i
be
proper
glad
to
parcel
out
amongst
ye
if
i
only
known
ye
was
short
but
i
have
got
with
me
father
in
there
said
joseph
pointing
to
the
common
house
they
having
a
meeting
elder
brewster
there
too
and
winslow
and
captain
standish
and
governor
prence
it
was
evident
that
some
matter
of
importance
was
being
discussed
for
a
little
knot
of
women
had
gathered
before
the
door
as
if
waiting
for
some
decision
to
be
announced
they
had
almost
reached
the
group
when
suddenly
from
the
north
there
came
a
low
roaring
noise
and
the
earth
beneath
their
feet
shook
and
trembled
so
violently
that
many
of
the
children
were
thrown
to
the
ground
while
the
bundles
goodman
pepperell
was
carrying
for
the
captain
flew
in
every
direction
those
who
kept
their
feet
at
all
reeled
and
staggered
in
a
strange
wild
dance
and
every
child
in
the
group
screamed
with
all
his
might
the
women
screamed
too
calling
frantically
to
the
children
and
the
men
came
pouring
out
of
the
door
of
the
common
house
trying
to
steady
themselves
as
they
were
flung
first
one
way
then
another
by
the
heaving
ground
it
lasted
but
a
few
dreadful
moments
and
the
captain
was
the
first
to
recover
his
speech
there
now
said
he
a
little
breathlessly
ai
it
lucky
i
had
my
sea
legs
on
anything
but
an
earthquake
anyway
the
instant
they
could
stay
on
their
feet
the
children
ran
to
their
mothers
who
were
also
running
to
them
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
the
whole
village
was
gathered
before
the
common
house
as
daniel
with
the
captain
and
his
father
joined
the
stricken
company
governor
bradford
was
speaking
he
had
been
governor
of
the
colony
for
so
long
that
in
time
of
sudden
stress
the
people
still
turned
to
him
for
counsel
though
prence
was
really
the
governor
think
ye
not
that
the
finger
of
the
lord
would
direct
us
by
this
visitation
he
said
to
the
group
we
were
met
together
in
council
because
some
of
our
number
wish
to
go
away
from
plymouth
to
find
broader
pastures
for
their
cattle
even
as
jacob
separated
from
esau
with
all
his
flocks
and
herds
in
this
i
see
a
sign
of
displeasure
at
our
removals
one
from
another
john
howland
now
found
his
voice
nay
but
he
said
shall
we
limit
the
bounty
of
the
lord
and
say
here
shall
he
prosper
us
what
say
the
scriptures
to
him
who
was
not
content
with
abundance
but
must
tear
down
his
barns
to
build
bigger
answered
the
governor
night
thy
soul
shall
be
required
of
thee
there
was
no
reply
and
the
pale
faces
grew
a
shade
paler
as
a
second
rumble
was
heard
in
the
distance
the
earth
again
began
to
tremble
and
a
mighty
wave
rolling
in
from
the
sea
crashed
against
the
shore
above
the
noise
of
the
waters
rose
the
voice
of
governor
bradford
he
looketh
upon
the
earth
and
it
trembleth
he
toucheth
the
hills
and
they
smoke
the
lord
is
merciful
and
gracious
he
will
not
always
chide
neither
will
he
keep
his
anger
forever
he
hath
not
dealt
with
us
after
our
sins
seeing
how
frightened
the
people
were
the
captain
broke
the
silence
which
fell
upon
the
trembling
group
after
the
governor
words
lord
love
ye
he
cried
heartily
this
no
earthquake
to
speak
of
scarcely
equal
to
an
ague
chill
down
in
the
tropics
they
would
have
no
respect
for
it
down
there
would
more
than
give
an
appetite
for
their
victuals
his
laugh
which
followed
cheered
many
hearts
and
was
echoed
in
faint
smiles
on
the
pale
faces
of
the
colonists
governor
bradford
himself
smiled
and
turning
to
the
captain
held
out
his
hand
thou
art
ever
a
tonic
thomas
he
said
and
there
is
always
a
welcome
for
thee
in
plymouth
and
for
thy
friends
too
he
added
turning
to
the
goodman
though
thou
knowest
him
not
he
is
haply
more
thy
friend
than
mine
said
the
captain
pushing
the
goodman
and
daniel
forward
to
shake
hands
with
the
governor
he
is
married
to
mistress
bradford
niece
and
his
name
is
pepperell
josiah
pepperell
of
cambridge
said
the
governor
lady
coming
forward
to
welcome
him
at
your
service
madam
answered
the
goodman
bowing
low
and
this
is
my
son
daniel
daniel
bowed
in
a
manner
to
make
his
mother
proud
of
him
if
she
could
have
seen
him
and
then
mercy
and
joseph
swarmed
up
bringing
their
older
brother
william
a
lad
of
fifteen
to
meet
his
new
cousin
and
the
four
children
ran
away
together
all
their
tongues
wagging
briskly
about
the
exciting
event
of
the
day
the
earthquake
had
now
completely
passed
and
the
people
roused
from
their
terror
hastened
to
their
homes
to
repair
such
damage
as
had
been
done
and
to
continue
the
tasks
which
it
had
interrupted
meanwhile
the
captain
distributed
his
letters
and
parcels
leaving
the
governor
to
become
acquainted
with
his
new
relative
learn
his
errand
and
help
him
on
his
journey
while
his
wife
hastened
home
to
prepare
a
dinner
for
company
it
was
a
wonderful
dinner
that
she
set
before
them
there
were
succotash
and
baked
codfish
a
good
brown
loaf
and
pies
made
of
blueberries
gathered
and
dried
the
summer
before
oh
if
only
mother
could
have
been
there
to
see
his
table
manners
on
that
occasion
he
sat
up
as
straight
as
a
ramrod
said
please
and
thank
you
ate
in
the
most
genteel
manner
possible
even
managing
blueberry
pie
without
disaster
and
was
altogether
such
an
example
of
behavior
that
mistress
bradford
said
before
the
meal
was
half
over
thou
leave
the
lad
with
us
cousin
pepperell
whilst
thou
art
on
thy
journey
i
fear
to
trouble
thee
said
the
goodman
and
the
captain
hath
a
purpose
to
take
him
to
provincetown
and
meet
me
here
on
my
return
the
land
is
mayhap
safer
than
the
sea
should
another
earthquake
visit
us
said
the
governor
gravely
and
he
will
more
than
earn
his
keep
if
he
will
but
help
william
with
the
corn
and
other
tasks
like
thyself
we
are
in
sad
need
of
more
hands
daniel
looked
eagerly
at
his
father
for
he
already
greatly
admired
his
cousin
william
and
longed
to
stay
with
him
moreover
the
earthquake
had
somewhat
modified
his
appetite
for
adventure
his
eyes
plead
said
the
goodman
and
i
know
it
would
please
his
mother
so
by
your
leave
he
may
stay
a
whoop
of
joy
from
the
three
young
bradfords
was
promptly
suppressed
by
their
mother
for
shame
she
said
thy
cousin
daniel
will
think
thou
hast
learned
thy
manners
from
the
savages
thou
shouldst
take
a
lesson
from
his
behavior
poor
daniel
squirmed
on
his
stool
and
thought
if
he
must
be
an
example
every
moment
of
his
stay
he
would
almost
choose
being
swallowed
up
by
a
tidal
wave
at
sea
after
all
the
matter
had
been
settled
however
and
that
very
afternoon
the
goodman
set
off
on
a
hired
horse
with
his
musket
across
his
and
a
head
full
of
instructions
from
the
governor
about
the
dangers
of
the
road
and
houses
where
he
might
spend
the
nights
there
was
a
queer
lump
in
daniel
throat
as
he
caught
the
last
glimpse
of
his
father
sturdy
back
as
it
disappeared
down
the
forest
trail
and
that
night
when
he
went
to
bed
with
william
in
the
loft
of
the
governor
log
house
he
thought
long
and
tenderly
of
his
mother
and
nancy
if
he
had
only
had
a
magic
mirror
such
as
beauty
had
in
the
palace
of
the
beast
he
might
have
looked
into
it
and
seen
them
going
patiently
about
their
daily
tasks
with
nothing
to
break
the
monotonous
routine
of
work
except
a
visit
from
wattles
who
came
to
see
if
nancy
knew
her
catechism
the
earthquake
had
been
felt
there
so
very
slightly
that
they
did
not
even
know
there
had
been
one
until
the
captain
stopped
on
his
return
voyage
the
next
week
to
bring
them
word
of
the
safe
journey
to
plymouth
iv
a
forest
trail
to
daniel
the
days
of
his
stay
in
plymouth
passed
quickly
he
hoed
corn
with
his
cousin
william
and
pulled
weeds
in
the
garden
with
joseph
and
mercy
and
in
the
short
hours
allowed
them
for
play
there
was
always
the
sea
they
ran
races
on
the
sand
when
the
tide
was
out
and
were
never
tired
of
searching
for
the
curious
things
washed
ashore
by
the
waves
one
day
they
gathered
driftwood
and
made
a
fire
on
the
shore
hung
a
kettle
over
it
and
cooked
their
own
dinner
of
lobsters
fresh
from
the
water
another
day
william
and
daniel
went
together
in
a
rowboat
nearly
to
duxbury
and
caught
a
splendid
codfish
that
weighed
ten
pounds
on
another
wonderful
day
john
howland
took
the
two
boys
hunting
with
him
it
was
the
first
time
daniel
had
ever
been
allowed
to
carry
a
gun
quite
like
a
man
and
he
was
the
proudest
lad
in
all
plymouth
that
night
when
the
three
hunters
returned
bringing
with
them
two
fine
wild
turkeys
and
a
hare
which
daniel
had
shot
he
loved
the
grave
wise
kindly
governor
and
his
brave
wife
and
grew
to
know
by
sight
at
least
most
of
the
other
people
of
the
town
more
than
ten
days
passed
in
this
way
and
they
were
beginning
to
wonder
why
the
goodman
did
not
return
the
captain
had
come
back
from
provincetown
and
had
been
obliged
to
go
on
to
boston
without
waiting
for
him
and
there
was
no
knowing
when
the
lucy
ann
would
appear
again
in
plymouth
harbor
then
one
day
as
dan
and
william
were
working
in
the
they
saw
a
tired
horse
with
two
people
on
his
back
come
out
of
the
woods
daniel
took
a
long
look
at
the
riders
then
throwing
down
his
hoe
and
shouting
it
father
tore
off
at
top
speed
to
meet
him
william
picked
up
his
hoe
and
followed
at
a
slower
pace
when
he
reached
the
group
dan
was
up
behind
his
father
on
the
pillion
with
his
arms
about
him
and
standing
before
them
on
the
ground
was
a
black
boy
about
william
own
size
and
age
he
had
only
a
little
ragged
clothing
on
and
what
he
had
seemed
to
make
him
uneasy
perhaps
because
he
had
been
used
to
none
at
all
in
his
native
home
far
across
the
sea
his
eyes
were
rolling
wildly
from
one
face
to
another
and
it
was
plain
that
he
was
in
a
great
state
of
fear
he
is
but
a
savage
as
yet
said
goodman
pepperell
he
was
doubtless
roughly
handled
on
the
voyage
and
hath
naught
but
fear
and
hatred
in
his
heart
it
will
take
some
time
to
make
a
christian
of
him
thou
must
help
in
the
task
daniel
for
thou
art
near
his
age
and
can
better
reach
his
darkened
mind
as
yet
he
understands
but
one
thing
he
can
eat
like
a
christian
or
rather
like
two
of
them
we
must
tame
him
with
food
and
kindness
what
is
his
name
asked
daniel
still
gazing
at
the
boy
with
popping
eyes
for
never
before
had
he
seen
a
skin
so
dark
illustration
call
him
zeb
said
his
father
come
zeb
said
william
taking
the
boy
gently
by
the
arm
and
looking
compassionately
into
the
black
face
food
he
shouted
the
word
at
him
as
if
he
were
deaf
but
poor
zeb
completely
bewildered
by
these
strange
meaningless
sounds
only
shrank
away
from
him
and
looked
about
as
if
seeking
a
way
of
escape
daniel
immediately
sprang
from
the
pillion
and
seized
zeb
other
arm
yes
zeb
he
howled
pointing
down
his
own
throat
and
rubbing
his
stomach
with
an
ecstatic
expression
it
is
probable
that
poor
zeb
understood
from
this
pantomime
that
he
was
about
to
be
eaten
alive
for
he
made
a
furious
effort
to
get
away
the
boys
held
firmly
to
his
arms
smiling
and
nodding
at
him
in
a
manner
meant
to
be
reassuring
but
which
only
convinced
the
poor
black
that
they
were
pleased
with
the
tenderness
of
his
flesh
and
were
enjoying
the
prospect
of
a
cannibal
feast
with
the
slave
boy
between
them
hanging
back
and
digging
in
his
claws
like
a
cat
being
pulled
by
the
tail
as
dan
told
his
mother
afterward
they
made
slow
progress
toward
the
village
news
of
the
return
spread
quickly
and
a
curious
crowd
of
children
gathered
to
gaze
at
zeb
for
many
of
them
had
never
seen
a
negro
before
in
their
lives
goodman
pepperell
went
at
once
to
the
governor
house
and
when
he
learned
that
the
captain
had
come
and
gone
he
decided
to
push
on
to
boston
at
once
by
land
is
an
easier
journey
than
the
one
i
have
just
taken
he
said
there
are
settlements
along
the
way
and
time
passes
i
have
been
gone
now
longer
than
i
thought
the
farm
work
waits
and
susanna
will
fear
for
our
safety
i
must
start
home
as
soon
as
i
can
return
this
horse
to
the
owner
and
secure
another
i
would
even
buy
a
good
mare
for
i
stand
in
need
of
one
on
my
farm
at
least
thou
must
refresh
thyself
before
starting
said
the
governor
wife
cordially
and
she
set
about
getting
dinner
at
once
while
his
father
went
with
the
governor
to
make
arrangements
for
the
journey
daniel
and
his
cousins
took
charge
of
zeb
with
mistress
bradford
permission
they
built
a
fire
on
the
shore
and
cooked
dinner
there
for
themselves
and
the
black
boy
who
was
more
of
a
show
to
them
than
a
whole
circus
with
six
clowns
would
be
to
us
as
he
watched
the
boys
lay
the
sticks
and
start
the
blaze
zeb
eyes
rolled
more
wildly
than
ever
no
doubt
he
thought
that
he
himself
was
to
be
roasted
over
the
coals
and
when
at
last
he
saw
william
lay
a
big
fish
on
the
fire
instead
his
relief
was
so
great
that
for
the
first
time
he
showed
a
row
of
gleaming
teeth
in
a
hopeful
grin
daniel
brought
him
a
huge
piece
of
it
when
the
fish
was
cooked
and
from
that
moment
zeb
regarded
him
as
his
friend
it
was
early
afternoon
before
all
the
preparations
were
completed
and
the
little
caravan
was
ready
to
start
on
its
perilous
journey
there
were
two
horses
and
john
howland
who
knew
the
trail
well
and
was
wise
in
woodcraft
was
to
go
with
them
as
far
as
marshfield
where
he
knew
of
a
horse
that
was
for
sale
half
the
town
gathered
to
see
them
off
john
howland
mounted
first
and
daniel
was
placed
on
the
pillion
behind
him
then
zeb
was
made
to
get
up
behind
the
goodman
and
off
they
started
followed
by
a
volley
of
farewells
and
messages
from
the
group
of
plymouth
friends
left
behind
for
a
little
distance
they
followed
the
then
plunging
into
the
woods
they
were
soon
lost
to
view
the
road
was
a
mere
blazed
trail
through
dense
forests
and
it
was
necessary
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
lest
they
lose
their
way
and
also
because
no
traveler
was
for
a
moment
safe
from
possible
attack
by
indians
hour
after
hour
they
plodded
patiently
along
sometimes
dismounting
and
walking
for
a
mile
or
so
to
stretch
their
legs
and
rest
the
horses
there
was
little
chance
for
talk
because
the
path
was
too
narrow
for
them
to
go
side
by
side
the
day
was
warm
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
slapping
the
mosquitoes
which
buzzed
about
them
in
swarms
daniel
would
have
fallen
asleep
sitting
in
the
saddle
in
the
late
afternoon
as
they
came
out
upon
an
open
moor
daniel
was
roused
by
hearing
a
suppressed
exclamation
from
john
howland
and
felt
him
reach
for
the
pistol
which
hung
from
his
belt
his
horse
pricked
up
his
ears
and
whinnied
and
the
horse
on
which
the
goodman
and
zeb
were
riding
answered
with
a
loud
neigh
daniel
peered
over
john
howland
broad
shoulder
just
in
time
to
see
a
large
deer
disappearing
into
a
thicket
of
young
birches
some
distance
ahead
of
them
oh
cried
daniel
pounding
on
john
howland
ribs
in
his
excitement
let
get
him
not
so
fast
not
so
fast
said
john
in
a
low
voice
pinning
with
his
elbow
the
hand
that
was
battering
his
side
let
be
thou
hast
seen
but
half
there
was
an
indian
on
the
track
of
that
deer
should
we
step
in
and
take
his
quarry
he
might
be
minded
to
empty
his
gun
into
us
instead
i
saw
him
standing
nigh
the
spot
where
the
trail
enters
the
wood
again
yonder
and
when
he
saw
us
he
slipped
like
a
shadow
into
the
underbrush
he
stopped
his
horse
the
goodman
came
alongside
and
the
two
men
talked
together
in
a
low
tone
shall
we
go
on
as
if
we
had
not
seen
him
asked
the
goodman
john
howland
considered
if
we
turn
back
the
savage
will
be
persuaded
we
have
seen
him
and
are
afraid
he
said
we
must
take
our
chance
it
may
be
he
hath
no
evil
intent
though
the
road
be
lonely
and
travelers
few
whatever
his
purpose
it
is
safer
to
go
on
than
to
stand
still
and
tightening
his
rein
he
boldly
urged
his
horse
across
the
open
space
daniel
heart
thumped
so
loudly
against
his
ribs
that
it
sounded
to
his
ears
like
a
as
they
crossed
the
clearing
and
entered
the
forest
on
the
other
side
they
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
into
the
woods
when
they
were
startled
by
the
report
of
a
gun
and
poor
zeb
fell
off
his
horse
and
lay
like
one
dead
in
the
road
for
a
moment
they
thought
he
had
been
shot
and
the
two
men
were
about
to
spring
to
his
rescue
when
zeb
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
began
to
run
like
one
possessed
he
is
but
scared
to
death
haply
he
hath
never
heard
a
gun
go
off
before
said
john
howland
and
sticking
his
spurs
into
his
horse
he
gave
chase
fleet
of
foot
though
he
was
zeb
was
no
match
for
a
horse
and
was
soon
overtaken
was
but
the
indian
shooting
the
deer
said
john
howland
laughing
in
spite
of
himself
at
poor
zeb
terror
is
a
promise
of
safety
for
the
present
at
least
nevertheless
i
like
not
the
look
of
it
the
saw
us
make
no
doubt
of
that
for
when
i
first
beheld
him
he
was
peering
at
us
as
though
to
fix
our
faces
in
his
mind
i
too
marked
how
he
stared
answered
the
goodman
as
he
seized
the
cowering
zeb
and
swung
him
again
to
his
seat
on
the
pillion
i
have
it
he
said
stopping
short
as
he
was
about
to
mount
the
savage
is
without
doubt
of
the
narragansett
tribe
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
dark
skin
of
this
boy
and
mistook
him
for
an
indian
lad
one
of
the
hated
pequots
who
they
thought
were
either
all
dead
or
sold
out
of
the
country
is
likely
they
have
no
knowledge
of
other
people
than
themselves
it
may
be
so
said
john
howland
doubtfully
but
is
as
likely
they
mistook
him
for
a
devil
it
once
befell
that
some
indians
finding
a
negro
astray
in
the
forest
were
minded
to
destroy
him
by
conjuring
thinking
him
a
demon
to
be
sure
is
but
a
year
since
the
narragansetts
helped
the
english
destroy
the
pequot
stronghold
and
the
few
pequots
who
were
neither
killed
nor
sold
they
still
hold
in
subjection
whatever
their
idea
it
bodes
no
good
either
to
zeb
or
to
us
for
their
enmity
never
sleeps
zeb
meantime
sat
clutching
the
pillion
and
looking
from
one
grave
face
to
the
other
as
if
he
knew
they
were
talking
of
him
and
the
goodman
patted
his
shoulder
reassuringly
as
he
mounted
again
they
were
now
nearing
a
small
settlement
and
the
path
widened
so
the
two
horses
could
walk
abreast
thou
have
a
special
care
in
the
stretch
from
well
beyond
mount
dagon
said
john
howland
for
thou
knowest
of
the
notorious
morton
who
founded
there
the
settlement
called
merry
mount
it
was
the
worshipful
endicott
who
wiped
it
out
much
trouble
hath
morton
to
answer
for
he
hath
corrupted
the
savages
adding
his
vices
to
theirs
he
hath
also
sold
them
guns
and
taught
them
to
use
them
for
which
cause
the
indians
of
this
region
are
more
to
be
feared
than
any
along
the
coast
they
are
drunken
armed
and
filled
with
hate
for
any
whom
they
esteem
their
enemies
daniel
hair
fairly
stood
on
end
he
had
felt
prepared
for
pirates
but
indians
lurking
in
dark
forests
were
quite
another
matter
he
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
john
howland
were
going
with
them
all
the
way
to
cambridge
but
he
well
knew
that
could
not
be
his
spirits
rose
somewhat
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
settlement
and
a
hearty
supper
at
the
house
of
goodman
richards
put
such
life
and
courage
into
his
heart
that
before
it
was
over
the
indians
were
no
more
to
him
than
pirates
then
while
his
father
and
john
howland
arranged
with
goodman
richards
for
the
purchase
of
a
horse
to
take
them
the
rest
of
their
journey
goodwife
richards
stowed
dan
away
in
an
attic
bed
while
zeb
worn
out
with
fear
and
fatigue
slept
soundly
on
the
hearth
courage
is
always
highest
in
the
morning
and
daniel
felt
bold
as
a
lion
the
next
day
as
he
and
his
father
bade
john
howland
and
the
richards
family
and
with
zeb
again
entered
the
forest
trail
the
two
boys
walked
on
ahead
while
the
goodman
became
acquainted
with
the
new
horse
whose
name
goodman
richards
had
told
him
was
penitence
but
which
they
shortened
to
penny
later
when
he
had
assured
himself
that
the
animal
was
trustworthy
goodman
pepperell
put
the
two
boys
in
the
saddle
and
walked
beside
them
leading
penny
by
the
bridle
taking
turns
in
this
way
they
went
on
for
some
miles
without
incident
until
dan
almost
forgot
his
fears
and
even
zeb
watching
his
face
and
echoing
its
expression
on
his
own
grew
less
and
less
timid
illustration
they
had
passed
the
place
which
howland
had
called
mount
dagon
and
which
is
now
known
as
wollaston
and
had
crossed
the
neponset
river
by
a
horse
bridge
and
were
walking
along
quite
cheerfully
the
two
boys
at
some
distance
ahead
of
penny
when
they
saw
a
little
way
ahead
of
them
an
indian
standing
motionless
beside
the
trail
dan
immediately
drew
zeb
behind
a
bush
and
when
an
instant
later
his
father
came
up
the
indian
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
he
had
come
the
goodman
looked
troubled
it
is
the
same
one
we
saw
yesterday
i
feel
sure
he
said
i
like
not
his
following
us
in
this
way
daniel
i
must
trust
thee
even
as
though
thou
wert
a
man
do
thou
get
upon
the
horse
back
with
zeb
behind
thee
i
will
walk
ahead
with
my
gun
ready
should
the
savage
attack
us
do
thou
speed
thy
horse
like
the
wind
to
the
next
village
and
bring
back
help
remember
it
is
thy
part
to
obey
three
lives
may
hang
on
it
with
his
heart
pounding
like
a
dan
mounted
penny
zeb
was
placed
on
the
pillion
behind
him
with
both
arms
clutching
his
waist
and
the
goodman
strode
ahead
his
keen
eyes
watching
in
every
direction
for
any
sign
of
danger
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
forest
except
the
soft
thud
of
the
horse
feet
the
cawing
of
a
crow
circling
out
of
sight
over
the
and
the
shrill
cry
of
a
blue
jay
confound
thee
thou
marplot
thou
of
the
wood
muttered
the
goodman
to
himself
as
he
listened
wert
thou
but
a
human
gossip
i
set
thee
in
the
stocks
till
thou
hadst
learned
to
hold
thine
evil
tongue
but
the
blue
jay
only
kept
up
his
squawking
passing
the
news
on
to
his
brethren
until
the
forest
rang
with
word
of
their
approach
it
did
not
need
the
blue
jays
to
tell
of
their
progress
however
for
though
no
other
sound
had
betrayed
their
advance
two
indians
were
creeping
stealthily
through
the
underbrush
keeping
pace
with
the
travelers
and
when
they
had
reached
a
favorable
spot
in
a
small
clearing
they
suddenly
sprang
from
their
with
a
cry
they
leaped
forward
and
seizing
one
of
legs
tried
to
drag
him
from
the
horse
back
the
yells
of
the
indians
were
as
nothing
to
those
that
zeb
then
let
loose
the
air
was
fairly
split
by
shrieks
and
the
horse
terrified
in
turn
leaped
forward
tearing
zeb
from
the
grasp
of
the
indian
and
almost
unseating
dan
by
the
jerk
but
dan
dug
his
knees
into
the
horse
sides
flung
his
arms
about
her
neck
and
holding
on
for
dear
life
tore
away
up
the
trail
with
zeb
clinging
like
a
limpet
to
his
waist
never
was
a
ride
like
that
even
john
gilpin
was
a
mild
performance
beside
it
for
zeb
shrieked
every
minute
of
the
way
as
they
sped
along
with
the
horse
tail
streaming
out
behind
like
the
tail
of
a
comet
and
the
daylight
showing
between
the
bouncing
boys
and
back
at
every
wild
leap
even
if
daniel
had
not
been
minded
to
obey
his
father
command
he
could
not
have
helped
himself
for
penny
took
matters
into
her
own
four
hoofs
and
never
paused
in
her
wild
career
until
covered
with
foam
she
dashed
madly
into
a
little
hamlet
where
the
village
of
neponset
now
stands
samuel
kittredge
was
just
starting
for
the
forest
with
his
axe
on
his
shoulder
when
his
ears
were
smitten
by
the
frantic
shrieks
of
zeb
and
thinking
it
must
be
a
wildcat
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
he
started
back
to
the
house
for
his
gun
before
he
reached
it
penitence
with
the
two
boys
on
her
back
came
thundering
toward
him
at
full
gallop
and
stopped
at
his
side
what
in
tarnation
is
the
matter
with
ye
he
exclaimed
gazing
in
amazement
at
the
strange
apparition
i
declare
for
it
that
nigger
is
all
but
scared
plumb
white
what
ails
ye
indians
gasped
dan
pointing
toward
the
trail
my
father
quick
no
more
words
were
needed
samuel
kittredge
dashed
into
his
house
snatched
his
gun
from
the
chimney
and
dashing
out
again
fired
it
into
the
air
poor
zeb
he
slid
off
over
the
horse
tail
on
to
the
ground
and
lay
there
in
a
heap
while
a
knot
of
men
responding
to
the
signal
of
sam
kittredge
gun
gathered
hurriedly
before
his
house
and
started
at
once
down
the
trail
you
stay
here
said
sam
to
dan
as
he
started
away
we
be
back
soon
with
your
father
if
the
pesky
have
got
him
or
if
they
have
added
another
man
grimly
and
off
they
went
goodwife
kittredge
now
took
charge
of
dan
and
zeb
while
her
son
a
boy
of
eleven
tied
penny
to
a
tree
beside
their
cabin
zeb
recovered
at
once
when
she
offered
him
a
generous
slice
of
but
dan
was
too
anxious
about
his
father
to
eat
he
stood
beside
penny
rubbing
her
neck
and
soothing
her
with
his
eyes
constantly
on
the
trail
and
his
ears
eagerly
listening
for
the
sound
of
shots
it
seemed
an
age
but
really
was
not
more
than
half
an
hour
before
he
saw
the
men
come
out
of
the
woods
and
oh
joy
his
father
was
with
them
leaving
penny
nibbling
grass
he
ran
to
meet
them
and
threw
his
arms
about
his
father
neck
crying
oh
dear
father
art
thou
hurt
nay
the
lord
was
merciful
answered
the
goodman
i
fired
but
one
shot
and
hit
one
of
the
i
am
sure
for
they
both
dived
back
into
the
woods
at
once
i
hid
myself
in
the
thick
underbrush
on
the
other
side
of
the
trail
and
waited
thinking
perhaps
i
could
creep
along
beside
it
out
of
sight
but
zeb
roaring
must
have
frighted
the
indians
doubtless
they
knew
it
would
rouse
the
countryside
at
any
rate
i
saw
no
more
of
them
and
when
these
good
samaritans
came
along
i
knew
i
was
safe
the
lungs
of
that
blackamoor
are
worth
more
to
thee
than
many
guns
laughed
sam
kittredge
is
a
pity
thou
couldst
not
bottle
up
a
few
of
his
screeches
to
take
with
thee
when
thou
goest
abroad
they
are
of
a
sort
to
make
a
wildcat
sick
with
envy
the
men
laughed
heartily
and
leaving
the
goodman
and
daniel
with
sam
returned
to
their
interrupted
tasks
goodwife
kittredge
insisted
on
their
resting
there
for
the
night
before
resuming
their
journey
you
must
be
proper
tired
said
she
with
motherly
concern
and
if
you
go
on
now
is
more
than
likely
those
rascally
knaves
will
follow
you
like
your
shadow
you
stand
a
sight
better
chance
of
safety
if
you
make
an
early
start
in
the
morning
your
horse
needs
rest
too
added
sam
i
rub
her
down
and
give
her
a
measure
of
corn
when
she
cooled
off
get
to
bed
with
the
chickens
and
start
with
the
sun
and
night
will
find
you
safe
in
your
own
home
again
to
this
plan
the
travelers
gladly
agreed
early
next
morning
after
a
hearty
breakfast
in
the
kittredges
cheerful
kitchen
they
set
forth
once
more
the
roosters
in
the
farmyard
were
still
crowing
and
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
music
of
robins
orioles
and
blackbirds
when
they
again
plunged
into
the
forest
trail
all
day
they
plodded
steadily
along
delayed
by
bad
roads
and
it
was
not
until
late
that
evening
that
they
at
last
came
in
sight
of
the
little
house
where
nancy
and
her
mother
slept
little
dreaming
how
near
they
were
to
a
happy
awakening
when
at
last
they
reached
the
cabin
the
goodman
fearing
to
alarm
his
wife
stopped
on
the
and
gently
called
her
name
he
had
called
but
once
when
a
shutter
was
thrown
open
and
the
goodwife
head
was
thrust
through
it
husband
son
she
cried
joyfully
nancy
awake
child
it
is
thy
father
and
brother
and
in
another
moment
the
door
flew
open
and
nancy
and
her
mother
flung
their
arms
about
the
necks
of
the
wanderers
when
the
horse
had
been
cared
for
they
went
into
the
cabin
nancy
raked
the
coals
from
the
ashes
the
fire
blazed
up
and
the
goodwife
gave
them
each
a
drink
of
hot
milk
zeb
blinked
sleepily
at
the
reunited
and
happy
family
as
dan
and
his
father
told
their
adventures
and
when
at
last
they
had
gone
to
their
beds
in
the
loft
he
sank
down
on
a
husk
mattress
which
the
goodwife
had
spread
for
him
on
the
floor
and
in
two
minutes
was
sound
asleep
illustration
v
the
new
home
goodman
pepperell
and
his
wife
rose
early
the
next
morning
and
leaving
the
two
children
still
sleeping
crept
down
the
ladder
to
the
floor
below
there
lay
zeb
also
sound
asleep
with
his
toes
toward
the
ashes
like
a
little
black
cinderella
the
goodwife
mother
heart
was
stirred
with
pity
as
she
looked
down
at
him
perhaps
she
imagined
her
own
boy
a
captive
in
a
strange
land
unable
to
speak
the
language
with
no
future
but
slavery
and
no
friends
to
comfort
his
loneliness
poor
lad
let
him
sleep
a
bit
too
she
said
to
her
husband
they
unbolted
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
sunlight
of
a
perfect
june
morning
the
dew
was
still
on
the
grass
robins
and
bobolinks
were
singing
merrily
in
the
young
apple
trees
which
owing
to
a
late
cold
spring
were
still
in
bloom
and
the
air
hummed
with
the
music
of
bees
wings
the
goodman
drew
a
deep
breath
as
he
gazed
at
the
beauty
about
him
is
good
to
be
at
home
again
he
said
to
his
wife
and
is
a
goodly
land
aye
better
even
than
old
england
there
space
here
room
enough
to
grow
he
looked
across
the
river
to
the
hills
of
boston
town
i
doubt
not
we
shall
live
to
see
a
city
in
place
of
yon
village
he
said
more
ships
seek
its
port
daily
and
there
are
settlements
along
the
whole
length
of
the
bay
is
a
marvel
where
the
people
come
from
the
plymouth
folk
are
scattering
to
the
north
and
south
and
already
villages
are
springing
up
between
plymouth
and
new
amsterdam
god
hath
prospered
us
wife
praise
be
to
his
holy
name
said
the
goodwife
reverently
but
husband
she
added
what
shall
we
do
with
our
increase
thou
hast
brought
home
a
horse
and
the
black
lad
the
horse
can
stay
out
of
doors
during
the
summer
but
there
is
not
room
for
him
in
the
and
the
lad
can
not
sleep
always
before
the
fire
i
have
thought
of
that
said
the
goodman
and
when
the
crops
are
in
i
purpose
to
build
a
larger
house
verily
it
will
be
needed
she
answered
the
crops
grow
like
weeds
in
this
new
soil
if
there
were
but
a
place
for
storage
i
could
put
away
much
for
winter
use
that
now
is
wasted
go
thou
and
look
at
the
garden
while
i
uncover
the
coals
and
set
the
kettle
to
boil
wait
a
moment
wife
said
the
goodman
i
have
somewhat
to
tell
thee
there
is
ever
a
black
spot
in
our
sunshine
though
the
danger
grows
less
all
the
while
as
the
settlements
increase
it
is
still
true
that
the
indians
are
ever
a
menace
and
i
fear
they
are
over
watchful
of
us
then
he
told
her
of
the
attack
in
the
forest
i
have
reason
to
think
the
spied
upon
us
all
the
way
to
boston
town
he
finished
i
did
not
tell
daniel
but
twice
i
saw
savages
on
our
trail
after
we
left
kittredge
i
wounded
one
in
the
encounter
and
they
will
not
forget
that
i
know
not
why
they
should
plot
against
the
black
boy
unless
it
is
to
revenge
themselves
upon
me
but
it
is
certain
they
tried
to
drag
him
away
with
them
into
the
woods
the
goodwife
listened
with
a
pale
face
is
well
then
that
we
have
a
watchdog
added
to
our
possessions
she
said
at
last
wattles
shepherd
hath
a
litter
of
pups
and
he
hath
promised
one
to
the
children
nancy
hath
waited
until
dan
came
home
that
he
might
share
the
pleasure
of
getting
it
with
her
she
hath
a
generous
heart
said
her
father
tenderly
aye
she
is
a
good
lass
though
headstrong
when
their
mother
reached
the
cabin
she
found
the
twins
up
and
dressed
and
daniel
trying
to
rouse
the
sleeping
zeb
wake
up
he
shouted
giving
him
a
shake
zeb
rolled
over
with
a
grunt
and
opened
his
eyes
take
him
outdoors
while
i
get
breakfast
said
the
goodwife
mercy
upon
me
what
shall

do
with
a
blackamoor
and
a
dog

underfoot
a
dog
cried
daniel

said
his
mother
and
not
able
to
wait
a
moment
to
hear
and
tell
such
wonderful
news
the
two
children
rushed
out
at
once
followed
by
zeb
when
their
mother
called
the
family
to
breakfast
half
an
hour
later
zeb
had
been
shown
the
garden
the
the
the
the
where
eggs
were
to
be
found
the
well
with
its
long
and
the
he
had
had
the
sheep
pointed
out
to
him
and
been
introduced
to
eliza
the
cow
and
allowed
to
give
penny
a
measure
of
corn
the
children
had
shouted
the
name
of
each
object
to
him
as
they
had
pointed
it
out
and
zeb
had
shown
his
white
teeth
and
grinned
and
nodded
a
great
many
times
as
if
he
understood
illustration
i
know
he
seen
eggs
before
for
he
sucked
one
dan
told
his
mother
zeb
was
given
his
breakfast
on
the
and
dan
tried
to
teach
him
the
use
of
a
spoon
without
much
success
and
afterwards
he
was
brought
in
to
family
prayers
his
eyes
rolled
apprehensively
as
he
looked
from
one
kneeling
figure
to
another
but
obeying
gesture
he
knelt
beside
him
and
for
ten
minutes
he
stuck
it
out
then
as
the
prayer
continued
to
pour
in
an
uninterrupted
stream
from
the
goodman
lips
he
quietly
crawled
out
on
all
fours
and
disappeared
through
the
door
dan
found
him
afterwards
out
by
the
and
as
there
was
a
yellow
streak
on
his
black
face
concluded
he
had
learned
his
lesson
about
the
hen
nest
altogether
too
well
he
was
given
a
hoe
and
taken
to
the
at
once
here
daniel
showed
him
just
how
to
cut
out
the
weeds
with
the
hoe
and
loosen
the
earth
about
the
roots
of
the
corn
zeb
nodded
and
grinned
so
cheerfully
that
after
watching
him
a
few
moments
daniel
called
nancy
and
they
started
for
wattles
house
in
the
village
to
get
the
puppy
they
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
when
nancy
glancing
around
saw
zeb
following
them
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
no
no
no
go
back
bawled
daniel
pointing
to
the
zeb
nodded
with
the
utmost
intelligence
and
followed
right
along
oh
dear
groaned
daniel
i
taught
him
to
do
things
by
showing
how
and
now
he
thinks
he
must
do
that
i
do
illustration
he
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
gazed
despairingly
at
zeb
zeb
promptly
sat
down
on
another
stone
and
beamed
at
him
in
vain
daniel
pointed
and
shouted
and
shook
his
head
zeb
nodded
as
cheerfully
as
ever
and
conscientiously
imitated
dan
every
move
in
spite
of
all
they
could
do
he
followed
them
clear
to
wattles
house
oh
dear
said
nancy
it
just
like
having
your
shadow
come
to
life
you
have
to
work
all
the
time
dan
or
zeb
wo
work
at
all
even
with
the
wonderful
new
puppy
in
his
arms
dan
took
a
gloomy
view
of
the
situation
i
sick
of
being
an
example
he
said
i
had
to
be
one
at
aunt
bradford
all
the
time
for
she
told
mercy
and
joseph
to
watch
how
i
behaved
and
now
here
this
crazy
blackamoor
mocking
everything
i
do
i
guess
father
wish
he
had
bought
him
the
days
that
followed
were
trying
ones
for
everybody
the
goodwife
was
nearly
distracted
trying
to
house
her
family
and
do
her
work
in
such
crowded
quarters
zeb
followed
dan
like
a
nightmare
and
the
goodman
delved
early
and
late
to
catch
up
with
the
work
which
had
waited
for
his
return
among
other
duties
there
were
berries
to
be
picked
in
the
pasture
and
dried
for
winter
use
and
this
task
fell
to
the
children
it
was
work
which
zeb
thoroughly
enjoyed
but
alas
he
ate
more
than
he
brought
home
on
one
occasion
he
ate
green
fruit
along
with
the
ripe
and
spent
a
noisy
night
afterward
holding
on
to
his
stomach
and
howling
at
each
new
pain
in
vain
the
goodwife
tried
to
cure
him
with
a
dose
of
hot
pepper
tea
zeb
took
just
enough
to
burn
his
mouth
and
finding
the
cure
worse
than
the
disease
roared
more
industriously
than
ever
she
was
at
her
wit
end
and
finally
had
to
leave
him
to
groan
it
out
alone
beside
the
fire
it
was
weeks
before
he
learned
to
understand
the
simplest
sentences
and
meanwhile
poor
dan
had
to
go
on
being
an
example
finally
one
day
the
goodman
brought
home
a
large
saw
from
boston
and
he
and
dan
showed
zeb
how
to
use
it
then
day
after
day
dan
and
zeb
sawed
together
making
boards
for
the
new
house
while
nancy
brought
her
carding
or
knitting
and
sat
on
a
stump
near
by
with
the
puppy
at
her
feet
or
nosing
about
in
the
bushes
they
had
named
the
dog
nimrod
because
as
nancy
said
he
is
surely
a
mighty
hunter
before
the
lord
just
like
nimrod
in
the
bible
he
sniffs
around
after
field
mice
all
the
time
and
if
he
only
sees
a
cat
he
barks
his
head
off
and
tears
after
her
like
lightning

the
summer
passed
quickly
away
with
few
events
to
take
them
outside
the
little
kingdom
of
home
in
which
they
lived
twice
the
captain
stopped
to
see
them
when
the
lucy
ann
put
in
at
boston
harbor
and
it
was
from
him
they
got
such
news
as
they
had
of
the
world
without
by
october
nimrod
had
grown
to
be
quite
a
large
dog
and
was
already
useful
with
the
sheep
and
zeb
could
understand
a
good
deal
of
what
was
said
to
him
though
it
was
noticeable
that
he
was
very
dull
when
it
concerned
tasks
he
did
not
like
with
dan
to
guide
him
he
was
able
to
help
shock
the
corn
and
pile
the
pumpkins
in
golden
heaps
between
the
rows
he
could
feed
the
cattle
and
milk
the
cow
and
draw
water
for
them
from
the
well
while
the
goodman
and
the
two
boys
worked
in
the
fields
gathering
the
crops
nancy
and
her
mother
dried
everything
that
could
be
dried
and
preserved
everything
that
could
be
preserved
until
there
was
a
wonderful
store
of
good
things
for
the
winter
one
day
when
all
the
rafters
were
festooned
with
strings
of
squashes
onions
and
seed
corn
braided
in
long
ropes
by
the
husks
the
goodman
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
another
load
of
seed
corn
and
looked
in
vain
for
a
place
to
put
it
there
is
no
place
said
the
goodwife
the
lord
hath
blessed
us
so
abundantly
there
is
not
room
to
receive
it
as
it
is
i
can
hardly
do
my
work
without
stepping
on
something
if
it
is
not
anything
else
it
is
sure
to
be
either
zeb
or
nimrod
truly
i
can
no
longer
clean
and
sand
my
floor
properly
for
the
things
that
are
standing
about
the
goodman
sat
down
on
the
settle
and
looked
long
and
earnestly
at
the
crowded
room
whistling
softly
to
himself
then
he
rose
and
went
to
the
village
and
as
a
result
the
neighbors
gathered
the
very
next
week
to
help
build
the
new
house
they
came
early
in
the
morning
the
men
with
axes
and
saws
on
their
shoulders
and
the
women
carrying
then
while
the
men
worked
in
the
forest
felling
trees
cutting
and
hauling
timbers
and
putting
them
in
place
the
women
helped
the
goodwife
make
whole
battalions
of
brown
loaves
and
regiments
of
pies
beside
any
number
of
other
good
things
to
eat
nancy
dan
and
zeb
ran
errands
and
caught
fish
and
dug
clams
and
gathered
nuts
to
supply
materials
for
them
and
were
promptly
on
hand
when
meal
time
came
there
were
so
many
helpers
that
in
a
wonderfully
short
time
the
was
up
the
roof
boards
were
on
and
a
great
fireplace
had
been
built
into
the
chimney
in
the
new
part
of
the
house
also
a
door
had
been
cut
through
to
connect
the
new
part
with
the
old
cabin
which
was
now
to
be
used
for
storage
and
as
a
stable
for
penny
and
eliza
and
a
for
zeb
when
all
this
was
done
and
the
roof
on
the
neighbors
returned
to
their
own
tasks
leaving
the
pepperells
to
lay
the
floors
cover
the
outside
with
boards
and
do
whatever
was
necessary
to
finish
the
house
it
was
late
in
the
fall
before
this
was
accomplished
and
the
family
had
settled
down
to
the
enjoyment
of
their
new
quarters
one
day
as
dan
and
zeb
were
bringing
in
boards
to
sheathe
the
room
on
the
inside
they
were
startled
to
see
two
indians
peering
out
at
them
from
the
shelter
of
the
woods
dropping
the
board
they
were
carrying
they
ran
like
deer
to
the
house
and
dan
told
his
father
what
they
had
seen
the
goodman
looked
thoughtful
as
he
went
on
with
his
task
of
sheathing
and
that
very
evening
he
worked
late
building
a
secret
closet
between
the
chimney
and
the
wall
it
will
be
a
handy
place
to
hide
thy
preserves
he
said
to
his
wife
and
a
refuge
should
the
indians
decide
to
give
us
trouble
he
cut
a
small
square
window
high
up
in
the
outside
wall
and
contrived
a
spring
hidden
in
the
chimney
to
open
the
door
when
this
spring
was
pressed
a
hole
would
suddenly
appear
in
what
seemed
a
solid
wall
revealing
the
shelves
this
closet
was
the
goodwife
special
pride
but
to
zeb
it
was
a
continuous
mystery
at
one
moment
there
was
the
solid
wall
the
next
without
touch
of
human
hands
a
door
would
fly
open
giving
a
tantalizing
glimpse
of
things
to
eat
which
he
could
never
touch
for
if
he
came
near
the
door
would
close
again
as
mysteriously
as
it
had
opened
dan
loved
to
tease
him
with
it
and
zeb
fearing
magic
would
take
to
his
heels
whenever
this
marvel
occurred
one
day
the
goodman
said
to
his
wife
thanksgiving
draws
near
and
surely
we
have
much
cause
for
thankfulness
this
year
for
the
lord
hath
exceedingly
blessed
us
there
are
yet
some
things
to
be
done
before
the
day
comes
and
i
wish
to
meet
it
with
my
task
finished
i
hear
there
is
a
ship
in
the
harbor
loaded
with
english
merchandise
and
i
go
to
boston
and
if
thou
art
so
minded
thou
canst
go
with
me
this
put
the
goodwife
in
quite
a
flutter
of
excitement
for
she
had
not
been
away
from
home
except
to
go
to
church
for
many
months
she
got
out
her
best
gown
that
very
evening
to
be
sure
it
was
in
proper
order
and
while
she
got
supper
gave
nancy
and
dan
an
endless
string
of
directions
about
their
tasks
in
her
absence
early
the
next
morning
she
mounted
the
pillion
behind
her
husband
and
the
three
children
watched
their
departure
dan
clutching
nimrod
who
was
determined
to
go
with
them
and
the
goodwife
calling
back
last
instructions
to
the
little
group
until
penny
was
well
on
the
road
to
charlestown
the
house
seemed
strangely
lonely
without
the
mother
in
it
but
there
was
no
time
for
the
children
to
mope
for
there
was
all
the
work
to
do
in
their
parents
absence
dan
took
command
at
once
you
both
have
to
mind
me
now
he
said
to
nancy
and
zeb
i
the
man
of
the
house
if
thou
the
man
of
it
i
the
woman
and
thou
and
zeb
will
both
have
to
do
as
say
retorted
nancy
or
else
mayhap
i
get
thee
no
dinner
mother
said
i
could
make
succotash
and
thou
that
better
than
anything
mother
said
above
all
things
not
to
let
the
fire
go
out
for
it
would
be
hard
to
bring
a
all
the
way
from
the
village
so
do
thou
bring
in
a
pile
of
wood
and
set
zeb
to
chopping
more
illustration
dan
counted
his
chances
very
well
he
said
at
last
with
condescension
thou
art
a
willful
baggage
but
i
give
thee
thy
way
only
make
the
big
kettle
full
all
that
day
nancy
bustled
importantly
about
the
house
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
and
her
skirts
looped
back
under
her
apron
in
imitation
of
her
mother
she
was
better
than
her
word
and
made
besides
the
succotash
for
dinner
and
after
they
had
eaten
it
said
to
dan
if
thou
wilt
go
out
to
the
field
and
bring
in
a
pumpkin
i
make
thee
some
pies
for
supper
dan
dearly
loved
pumpkin
pie
and
in
his
zeal
to
carry
out
the
plan
brought
in
two
great
yellow
globes
from
the
instead
of
the
one
nancy
had
asked
for
mercy
upon
us
said
nancy
when
he
appeared
beaming
with
one
under
each
arm
those
would
make
pies
enough
for
all
cambridge
thine
eyes
hold
more
than
thy
stomach
there
no
such
thing
as
too
many
pies
said
daniel
stoutly
and
if
there
any
pumpkin
left
over
i
feed
it
to
the
pig
i
tell
thee
what
we
will
do
said
nancy
we
will
make
a
great
surprise
for
mother
and
father
when
they
come
home
they
will
be
tired
and
hungry
and
ready
for
a
grand
supper
do
thou
and
zeb
run
down
to
the
bay
and
bring
back
a
mess
of
clams
we
have
the
table
all
spread
and
a
bright
fire
burning
to
welcome
them
dan
agreed
to
this
plan
and
went
out
at
once
to
call
zeb
he
found
him
by
the
with
an
egg
in
each
hand
take
them
in
to
nancy
commanded
dan
pointing
sternly
toward
the
house
zeb
had
meant
to
dispose
of
them
otherwise
for
he
had
a
bottomless
appetite
for
eggs
but
he
trotted
obediently
to
the
house
at
dan
order
and
then
the
two
boys
started
together
for
the
bay
with
nimrod
barking
joyfully
and
running
about
them
in
circles
all
the
way
illustration
the
fall
days
were
short
and
it
was
dusk
before
the
evening
chores
were
done
and
dan
came
in
to
the
bright
kitchen
with
zeb
and
nimrod
both
at
his
heels
and
announced
that
he
had
a
hole
in
his
stomach
as
big
as
a
bushel
basket
for
answer
nancy
pointed
to
four
pies
cooling
on
a
shelf
and
dan
smacked
his
lips
in
anticipation
zeb
came
alongside
and
copying
dan
smacked
his
lips
too
go
away
both
of
you
said
nancy
you
can
only
look
at
them
now
for
i
have
everything
ready
for
father
and
mother
and
we
must
eat
until
they
come
dan
looked
about
the
room
to
see
what
nancy
surprise
might
be
it
was
a
cheerful
picture
that
met
his
eye
first
of
all
there
was
nancy
herself
with
her
neat
cap
and
white
apron
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
little
feast
she
had
prepared
she
had
spread
the
table
with
the
best
linen
and
decorated
it
with
a
bunch
of
red
berries
she
had
even
brought
out
the
silver
tankard
from
its
under
the
eaves
of
the
loft
and
placed
it
beside
her
father
trencher
the
clams
were
simmering
on
the
fire
sending
out
an
appetizing
smell
and
the
brown
loaf
was
cut
the
hickory
logs
snapped
and
sputtered
and
the
flames
danced
gayly
in
the
fireplace
setting
other
little
flames
dancing
in
the
shining
pewter
dishes
arranged
on
a
dresser
across
the
room
nimrod
was
lying
before
the
fire
with
his
head
on
his
paws
asleep
and
zeb
squatted
down
beside
him
was
rolling
his
eyes
hungrily
in
the
direction
of
the
pies
i
hope
they
come
soon
said
daniel
lifting
the
cover
of
the
kettle
and
sniffing
if
they
do
not
is
likely
they
find
me
as
dead
as
a
salt
herring
when
they
get
here
nancy
laughed
and
breaking
a
slice
of
in
two
gave
a
piece
to
each
boy
take
that
to
stay
your
stomachs
she
said
and
for
the
rest
have
patience
for
a
long
time
they
waited
and
still
there
was
no
sound
of
hoofs
upon
the
road
dusk
deepened
into
darkness
and
the
harvest
moon
came
out
from
behind
a
cloud
and
shed
a
silvery
light
over
the
landscape
nancy
went
to
the
door
and
gazed
toward
the
road
dost
think
brother
the
indians
have
waylaid
them
she
asked
dan
at
last
nay
answered
dan
they
are
likely
delayed
at
the
ferry
should
the
be
at
his
supper
wild
horses
could
not
drag
him
from
it
i
be
bound
they
come
presently
never
fear
but
it
will
doubtless
grieve
them
much
to
see
me
lying
stiff
and
cold
on
the
hearth
nancy
thou
takest
a
fearful
chance
in
denying
thy
brother
food
illustration
but
nancy
only
laughed
at
his
woebegone
face
thou
art
indeed
a
valiant
she
said
then
suddenly
inspired
she
brought
him
the
extra
pumpkin
which
she
had
not
used
for
the
pies
set
it
before
him
upon
the
and
gave
him
a
knife
carve
thyself
a
she
said
will
take
up
thy
mind
and
make
thee
forget
thy
stomach
dan
took
the
knife
cut
a
cap
from
the
top
of
the
pumpkin
and
scooped
out
the
seeds
then
he
cut
holes
for
the
eyes
and
nose
and
a
fearful
gash
bordered
with
pointed
teeth
for
the
mouth
and
nancy
brought
him
the
stub
of
a
bayberry
candle
to
put
inside
zeb
watched
the
process
with
eyes
growing
wider
and
wider
as
the
thing
became
more
and
more
like
some
frightful
creature
of
his
pagan
imagination
they
were
just
about
to
light
the
candle
when
nimrod
gave
a
sharp
bark
there
was
a
creaking
noise
outside
and
nancy
springing
joyfully
to
her
feet
shouted
they
come
they
come
she
was
halfway
to
the
door
when
suddenly
she
stopped
stiff
with
fright
there
looking
in
through
the
open
shutter
was
the
face
of
an
indian
dan
and
zeb
saw
it
at
the
same
moment
and
nimrod
barking
madly
rushed
forward
and
leaped
at
the
window
giving
one
of
his
wildcat
shrieks
zeb
instantly
went
up
the
ladder
to
the
loft
with
the
agility
of
a
monkey
the
head
had
bobbed
out
of
sight
so
quickly
that
for
an
instant
nancy
hardly
believed
her
own
eyes
but
in
that
instant
dan
had
been
quick
to
act
he
pressed
the
catch
concealed
in
the
fireplace
and
springing
to
his
feet
seized
nancy
and
dragged
her
back
into
the
secret
closet
they
nearly
fell
over
the
pumpkin
which
lay
directly
in
their
path
and
it
rolled
before
them
into
the
closet
once
inside
they
instantly
closed
the
door
and
with
wildly
beating
hearts
sank
down
in
the
darkness
about
a
foot
above
the
floor
there
was
a
small
in
the
door
which
the
goodman
had
purposely
left
for
a
and
to
this
dan
now
glued
his
eyes
in
spite
of
nimrod
frantic
barking
the
house
door
was
quietly
opened
and
when
the
dog
flew
at
the
intruder
he
was
stunned
by
a
blow
from
the
butt
end
of
a
musket
and
his
senseless
body
sent
flying
out
of
the
door
by
a
kick
from
a
moccasined
foot
then
two
indians
crept
stealthily
into
the
room
they
were
surprised
to
find
it
empty
where
could
the
children
have
gone
they
prowled
cautiously
about
looking
under
the
table
and
behind
everything
that
might
afford
a
and
finding
no
trace
of
them
turned
their
attention
in
another
direction
dan
was
already
near
to
bursting
with
rage
and
grief
over
nimrod
and
now
he
had
the
misery
of
seeing
the
larger
of
the
two
indians
take
his
father
musket
from
the
on
the
while
the
other
who
already
had
a
gun
with
grunts
of
satisfaction
took
the
silver
tankard
from
the
table
and
hid
it
under
his
jacket
at
first
they
did
not
seem
to
notice
the
ladder
to
the
loft
soon
however
they
paused
beside
it
and
after
they
had
exchanged
a
few
grunts
the
larger
indian
began
to
mount
it
was
plain
they
meant
to
make
a
thorough
search
for
the
children
who
had
so
miraculously
disappeared
dan
remembered
what
his
father
had
said
about
the
pequots
nancy
with
sick
fear
in
her
heart
for
zeb
was
shivering
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
her
hands
over
her
eyes
though
that
was
quite
unnecessary
since
the
closet
was
pitch
dark
dan
found
her
ear
and
whispered
into
it
a
brief
report
of
what
he
had
seen
they
could
now
hear
the
stealthy
tread
of
moccasined
feet
above
them
on
the
floor
of
the
loft
while
they
upstairs
whispered
dan
i
going
to
slip
out
and
get
father
pistol
it
hanging
behind
a
string
of
onions
and
they
have
found
it
oh
no
gasped
nancy
she
clung
to
him
and
in
trying
to
get
up
he
struck
the
pumpkin
which
rolled
away
toward
the
outside
wall
of
the
closet
just
then
there
was
a
fearful
outburst
of
noise
overhead
there
was
the
sound
of
something
being
dragged
from
under
a
bed
across
the
floor
something
which
clawed
and
shrieked
and
fought
like
a
wildcat
there
were
grunts
and
the
thump
of
moccasined
feet
dancing
about
in
a
lively
struggle
now
is
my
chance
said
dan
to
himself
and
opening
the
door
cautiously
he
made
a
dash
for
the
pistol
and
snatched
it
from
its
as
he
was
leaping
back
to
the
closet
he
saw
the
bayberry
candle
lying
on
the
hearth
and
in
that
instant
a
wonderful
idea
flashed
into
his
mind
he
picked
up
the
candle
lit
it
from
the
flames
and
scurried
back
to
his
just
as
the
legs
of
an
indian
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
he
shut
the
door
swiftly
behind
him
and
giving
the
candle
to
nancy
told
her
to
set
it
inside
the
pumpkin
crawling
to
the
other
end
of
the
closet
nancy
did
as
she
was
bid
while
dan
with
his
eye
at
the
watched
the
two
indians
drag
poor
zeb
between
them
down
the
ladder
and
out
the
door
eager
to
see
where
they
went
dan
climbed
up
to
the
little
window
of
the
closet
and
peered
out
into
the
night
by
the
moonlight
he
could
see
the
two
men
dragging
zeb
in
the
direction
of
the
they
were
having
a
hard
time
of
it
for
zeb
struggled
fiercely
and
they
had
their
guns
and
the
tankard
to
take
care
of
as
well
and
in
addition
to
dan
horror
one
of
them
was
waving
a
burning
brand
which
he
had
snatched
from
the
fire
in
passing
dan
trembled
so
with
excitement
that
he
nearly
fell
from
his
perch
but
kept
his
wits
about
him
give
me
the
pumpkin
he
said
to
nancy
and
when
she
reached
it
up
to
him
he
set
the
lurid
grinning
face
in
the
window
now
the
pistol
he
said
and
sticking
the
muzzle
through
the
opening
beside
the
he
fired
it
into
the
air
the
shot
was
answered
by
a
chorus
of
yells
from
the
three
figures
by
the
scared
out
of
their
wits
by
the
unexpected
shot
and
by
the
frightful
apparition
which
suddenly
glared
at
them
out
of
the
darkness
the
indians
took
to
their
heels
and
ran
as
only
indians
can
run
dragging
poor
zeb
with
them
they
gone
shouted
dan
dropping
to
the
floor
but
they
set
the
afire
illustration
by
the
dim
light
of
the
grinning
in
the
window
he
found
the
catch
of
the
door
and
the
two
children
burst
out
of
the
closet
seizing
a
bucket
of
water
which
stood
by
the
in
the
corner
dan
dashed
out
of
doors
followed
by
nancy
whose
fear
of
indians
was
now
overmastered
by
fear
of
fire
if
their
beautiful
new
house
should
be
burned
she
ran
to
the
and
while
dan
worked
like
a
demon
stamping
on
burning
straws
with
his
feet
and
pouring
water
on
the
spreading
flames
she
swiftly
plunged
first
one
bucket
then
another
into
the
well
and
filled
dan
pail
as
fast
as
it
was
emptied
in
spite
of
these
heroic
efforts
the
fire
spread
all
they
could
do
was
to
keep
the
ground
wet
about
the
stack
and
watch
the
flying
sparks
lest
they
set
fire
to
the
house
over
the
lurid
scene
the
grinned
down
at
them
until
the
candle
sputtered
and
went
out
illustration
the
was
blazing
fiercely
lighting
the
sky
with
a
red
glare
when
in
the
distance
they
heard
the
beat
of
a
drum
wattles
had
seen
the
flames
and
was
rousing
the
village
then
there
were
on
the
road
and
into
the
dashed
penny
with
the
terrified
goodman
and
his
wife
on
her
back
once
they
knew
their
children
were
safe
they
did
not
stop
for
questions
but
at
once
set
to
work
to
help
them
check
the
fire
which
was
now
spreading
among
the
dry
leaves
the
goodwife
ran
for
her
broom
which
she
dipped
in
water
and
then
beat
upon
the
little
flames
as
they
appeared
here
and
there
in
the
grass
the
goodman
mounted
to
the
roof
at
once
and
with
dan
to
fetch
water
and
nancy
to
bring
up
buckets
from
the
well
they
managed
to
keep
it
too
wet
for
the
flying
sparks
to
set
it
afire
at
last
the
neighbors
roused
by
wattles
frantic
alarm
came
hurrying
across
the
pastures
but
the
distance
was
so
great
that
the
flames
had
died
down
and
the
danger
was
nearly
over
before
they
arrived
illustration
there
was
now
time
for
explanations
and
surrounded
by
an
eager
and
circle
nancy
and
dan
told
their
story
there
a
brave
lad
for
you
cried
stephen
day
when
the
tale
was
finished
patting
dan
on
the
shoulder
aye
and
a
brave
lass
too
added
another
their
father
and
mother
said
no
words
of
praise
but
there
was
a
glow
of
pride
in
their
faces
as
they
looked
at
their
children
and
silently
thanked
god
for
their
safety
we
can
do
nothing
said
goodman
pepperell
at
last
but
neighbors
if
you
are
with
me
we
will
go
into
the
woods
and
see
if
we
can
find
any
trace
of
the
black
boy
doubtless
by
stealing
him
and
burning
the
house
they
thought
to
revenge
themselves
for
the
indian
whom
i
wounded
on
my
way
home
from
plymouth
they
must
have
been
watching
the
house
and
seeing
us
depart
this
morning
knew
well
that
they
had
naught
but
children
to
deal
with
aye
but
such
children
said
stephen
day
who
had
been
greatly
impressed
by
the
story
of
the
we
follow
them
indeed
and
if
we
find
them
his
jaw
shut
with
a
snap
and
he
said
no
more
illustration
while
the
men
laid
their
plans
for
the
morrow
the
children
and
their
mother
stole
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
dan
began
a
search
for
nimrod
he
had
been
neither
seen
nor
heard
since
the
indian
had
given
him
that
fearful
blow
and
thrown
him
out
they
found
him
lying
a
few
feet
from
the
house
still
half
stunned
and
dan
lifted
him
tenderly
in
his
arms
brought
him
into
the
house
and
laid
him
down
before
the
fire
where
he
had
slept
so
peacefully
only
one
short
hour
before
nimrod
licked
his
hand
and
rapped
his
tail
feebly
on
the
hearthstone
nancy
wept
over
him
while
dan
bathed
his
wounded
head
and
tried
to
find
out
if
any
bones
were
broken
poor
nimrod
said
the
goodwife
as
she
set
a
bowl
of
milk
before
the
wounded
dog
thou
art
a
brave
soldier
drink
this
and
soon
thou
wilt
be
wagging
thy
tail
as
briskly
as
ever
she
stirred
the
fire
and
lit
the
candles
and
when
the
goodman
came
in
a
few
moments
later
the
little
family
looked
about
their
new
home
to
see
what
damage
had
been
done
nancy
little
feast
was
a
sad
wreck
there
were
the
pies
to
be
sure
but
the
was
awry
and
the
flowers
were
tipped
over
and
strewn
about
the
floor
which
was
covered
with
the
tracks
of
muddy
feet
in
the
scuffle
with
zeb
the
had
been
overturned
and
the
settle
was
lying
on
its
back
on
the
floor
the
room
looked
as
if
a
hurricane
had
passed
through
it
the
goodman
mourned
the
loss
of
his
gun
and
the
goodwife
grieved
for
her
tankard
but
all
smaller
losses
were
forgotten
in
their
distress
about
zeb
not
only
had
he
cost
the
goodman
a
large
sum
of
money
but
in
the
weeks
he
had
been
with
them
he
had
found
his
own
place
in
the
household
where
he
would
be
sadly
missed
worst
of
all
was
their
anxiety
about
his
fate
at
the
hands
of
the
indians
come
said
the
goodwife
at
last
when
they
had
heard
every
event
of
the
day
twice
over
we
must
eat
or
we
shall
have
scant
courage
for
the
duties
of
the
morrow
we
have
none
of
us
tasted
food
since
noon
the
clams
were
still
simmering
gently
in
the
pot
and
she
gave
them
each
a
porringer
of
broth
which
they
ate
sitting
in
a
circle
about
the
then
she
put
the
room
in
order
and
though
her
heart
was
heavy
tried
to
talk
of
the
events
of
their
day
in
boston
as
if
nothing
had
happened
illustration
we
saw
captain
sanders
in
town
she
said
to
the
children
he
hath
brought
the
lucy
ann
to
port
with
a
load
of
cod
for
the
market
and
with
fish
and
game
for
thanksgiving
i
have
his
promise
that
he
will
dine
with
us
if
god
wills
he
hath
not
yet
seen
our
new
house
alas
i
shall
have
no
tankard
to
set
before
him
yet
ungrateful
that
i
am
we
are
still
rich
in
blessings
is
well
we
have
a
day
set
aside
to
remind
us
of
them
it
was
very
late
when
at
last
the
excitement
had
died
down
enough
to
think
of
sleep
the
goodman
went
out
to
make
sure
there
was
no
fire
left
lurking
in
the
grass
and
to
take
a
look
at
the
horse
and
cow
as
he
passed
the
smoking
ashes
of
the
his
foot
struck
something
which
rang
like
metal
and
in
the
moonlight
something
glistened
in
the
path
before
him
stooping
he
felt
for
it
and
was
overjoyed
to
grasp
the
tankard
which
the
indian
had
lost
in
the
struggle
with
zeb
he
carried
it
in
to
his
wife
at
once
she
seized
it
with
a
cry
of
joy
is
a
good
omen
she
said
mayhap
thou
find
thy
musket
too
her
husband
shook
his
head
gravely
i
have
need
of
one
he
said
is
well
i
still
have
my
and
my
pistol
then
he
called
the
family
together
and
kneeling
beside
the
settle
committed
them
to
god
keeping
for
the
night
illustration
vi
harvest
home
before
daylight
the
next
morning
the
goodwife
stood
in
the
door
of
the
new
house
and
watched
her
husband
set
forth
with
the
men
of
cambridge
to
search
the
forest
for
zeb
and
to
punish
his
captors
if
they
should
catch
them
she
had
given
him
a
good
breakfast
and
filled
his
pockets
with
bread
for
the
journey
and
when
the
men
came
from
the
village
she
cut
nancy
pies
and
gave
them
each
a
generous
piece
to
eat
before
starting
there
were
eight
men
in
the
party
all
armed
the
lip
trembled
a
little
and
then
moved
in
prayer
as
she
saw
them
disappear
into
the
dark
forest
god
grant
that
they
may
all
return
in
safety
she
murmured
and
then
giving
herself
a
little
shake
she
turned
back
into
the
house
and
resolutely
set
herself
at
the
duties
of
the
day
nimrod
whined
and
tried
to
follow
his
master
as
the
men
marched
away
with
their
guns
on
their
shoulders
but
finding
himself
too
weak
lay
down
again
on
the
hearth
and
went
to
sleep
the
goodwife
cleaned
the
kitchen
removing
the
last
traces
of
the
intruders
and
then
began
a
patient
march
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
beside
the
whirling
now
that
the
harvest
was
over
and
their
food
provided
for
the
winter
her
busy
hands
must
spin
the
yarn
and
weave
the
cloth
to
keep
them
warm
though
she
had
meant
to
let
the
children
sleep
after
the
excitement
of
the
previous
day
it
was
still
early
when
they
were
awakened
by
the
whir
of
the
wheel
and
came
scuttling
down
from
the
loft
as
as
if
the
adventures
of
the
night
before
had
been
no
more
than
a
bad
dream
they
helped
themselves
to
hasty
pudding
and
milk
and
took
a
dishful
to
nimrod
who
was
now
awake
and
looking
much
more
lively
and
then
their
mother
set
them
their
tasks
for
the
day
nancy
said
she
i
gave
all
thy
pies
to
the
men
who
have
gone
with
father
to
hunt
for
zeb
will
be
thanksgiving
day
and
we
shall
need
more
the
mince
pies
are
already
prepared
and
put
away
on
the
shelves
and
thou
canst
make
apple
and
pumpkin
both
to
set
away
beside
them
in
the
secret
closet
that
makes
me
think
said
daniel
and
touching
the
secret
spring
he
opened
the
door
and
rescued
the
from
the
it
was
only
a
wilted
and
blackened
old
pumpkin
that
he
brought
to
his
mother
but
she
smiled
at
it
and
patted
the
hideous
head
he
hath
been
a
good
friend
to
us
dan
she
said
as
say
the
scriptures
hath
chosen
the
weak
things
of
the
earth
to
confound
the
mighty
david
went
out
against
goliath
with
a
sling
and
a
stone
and
thou
hast
overcome
savages
with
naught
but
a
foolish
pumpkin
illustration
nancy
took
the
grinning
head
and
set
it
on
the
dear
old
jacky
she
said
thou
shalt
come
to
our
thanksgiving
feast
is
no
more
than
thy
due
since
thou
hast
saved
us
from
the
savages
nay
daughter
said
her
mother
that
savoreth
of
idolatry
give
thy
praise
unto
god
who
useth
even
things
which
are
not
to
bring
to
naught
the
things
that
are
is
but
a
pumpkin
after
all
and
will
make
an
excellent
feast
for
the
pig
on
the
morrow
daniel
go
to
the
field
and
bring
thy
sister
a
fresh
one
for
the
pies
and
then
hasten
to
thine
own
tasks
they
wait
for
thee
while
thy
father
is
away
searching
for
zeb
thou
must
do
his
work
as
well
as
thine
own
dost
think
mother
that
he
will
surely
bring
zeb
back
in
time
for
the
feast
asked
nancy
anxiously
let
us
pray
nothing
doubting
answered
the
mother
if
it
be
will
they
will
return
there
was
a
tremor
in
her
voice
even
as
she
spoke
her
brave
words
for
she
knew
well
the
perils
of
their
search
all
day
long
they
worked
praying
as
they
prepared
the
feast
that
they
might
share
it
a
united
family
nancy
made
the
pies
and
dan
dressed
a
fowl
while
their
mother
got
ready
a
pot
of
beans
made
to
bake
in
the
oven
with
the
pies
and
steamed
an
indian
pudding
all
day
they
watched
the
forest
for
sign
of
the
returning
men
all
day
they
listened
for
the
sound
of
guns
but
neither
sight
nor
sound
rewarded
their
vigilance
illustration
dusk
came
on
the
goodwife
set
a
candle
in
the
window
and
when
her
other
tasks
were
finished
went
back
to
her
spinning
not
a
moment
was
she
idle
nor
did
she
appear
to
her
children
to
be
anxious
but
as
she
walked
back
and
forth
beside
her
wheel
nancy
heard
her
murmuring
because
thou
hast
made
the
lord
which
is
my
refuge
even
the
most
high
thy
habitation
there
shall
no
evil
befall
thee
neither
shall
any
plague
come
nigh
thy
dwelling
over
and
over
she
said
it
to
herself
never
slacking
her
work
meanwhile
the
supper
which
nancy
prepared
waited
one
hour
two
after
dan
had
fed
the
cattle
and
brought
in
the
milk
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
the
searching
party
suddenly
nimrod
from
his
place
on
the
hearth
gave
a
short
sharp
bark
and
leaping
to
the
window
stood
with
his
paws
on
the
sill
peering
out
into
the
darkness
and
whining
dan
was
beside
him
in
an
instant
i
see
them
he
cried
joyfully
a
whole
parcel
of
them
they
are
just
coming
out
from
behind
the
nancy
and
her
mother
reached
the
window
almost
at
the
same
moment
and
as
the
shadowy
figures
emerged
from
behind
the
the
mother
counted
them
breathlessly
one
two
three
four
five
there
father
shrieked
nancy
he
carrying
something
oh
dost
think
it
is
zeb
six
seven
eight
ten
there
are
ten
men
when
but
eight
set
forth
praise
god
they
have
all
come
back
cried
the
mother
turning
swiftly
to
the
fireplace
she
snatched
from
it
a
brand
of
burning
pitch
pine
and
holding
it
high
above
her
head
for
a
beacon
ran
out
to
meet
them
with
dan
nancy
and
nimrod
all
at
her
heels
the
shone
on
stern
and
weary
faces
as
the
men
drew
near
all
well
wife
came
the
voice
of
the
goodman
hast
found
the
lad
she
called
back
to
him
nay
not
yet
he
answered
but
we
think
we
have
his
captors
hold
thy
torch
nearer
and
have
no
fear
the
savages
can
not
hurt
thee
nancy
daniel
have
you
ever
seen
these
faces
before
as
he
spoke
he
thrust
forward
two
indians
with
their
hands
securely
tied
behind
them
oh
shuddered
nancy
i
saw
them
at
the
window
and
dan
added
aye
was
this
one
that
kicked
nimrod
nimrod
confirmed
his
statement
by
growling
fiercely
and
snapping
at
the
heels
of
the
taller
of
the
two
indians
call
off
thy
dog
said
the
goodman
sternly
and
though
dan
felt
it
would
be
no
more
than
fair
to
allow
nimrod
one
good
bite
considering
all
he
had
suffered
he
obediently
collared
nimrod
and
shut
him
inside
the
kitchen
the
faces
of
the
indians
were
like
stone
masks
as
they
stood
helpless
before
their
captors
with
the
light
of
the
flaming
torch
shining
upon
them
go
in
with
thy
family
neighbor
pepperell
said
stephen
day
there
are
enough
of
us
and
to
spare
to
guard
the
savages
mayhap
a
night
in
the
stocks
will
cool
their
hot
blood
and
help
them
to
remember
what
they
have
done
with
the
slave
lad
if
not
the
judge
will
mete
out
to
them
the
punishment
they
deserve
right
willingly
will
i
leave
them
in
your
hands
answered
the
goodman
for
truly
i
am
spent
whether
the
indians
understood
their
words
or
not
they
knew
well
the
meaning
of
pointed
guns
for
they
marched
off
toward
the
village
without
even
a
grunt
of
protest
when
stephen
day
gave
the
word
of
command
the
goodman
was
so
weary
that
his
wife
and
children
forbore
asking
questions
until
he
was
a
little
rested
and
refreshed
he
sank
down
upon
the
settle
with
nimrod
beside
him
and
dan
removed
his
muddy
boots
and
brought
water
for
him
to
wash
in
while
nancy
and
her
mother
hastened
to
put
the
supper
on
the
table
this
puts
new
life
into
me
declared
the
father
when
he
had
eaten
a
few
spoonfuls
of
hotchpot
and
now
i
tell
somewhat
of
the
work
there
was
no
general
uprising
among
the
indians
at
least
we
saw
no
evidence
of
it
is
more
likely
as
i
feared
they
are
the
same
indians
that
followed
us
from
plymouth
meaning
to
revenge
themselves
upon
me
for
wounding
one
of
them
when
they
set
upon
us
in
the
forest
but
how
is
it
the
lad
was
not
with
them
asked
his
wife
that
is
a
question
which
as
yet
hath
no
answer
replied
her
husband
it
may
be
they
have
killed
him
and
hidden
the
body
at
this
fearful
thought
nancy
shuddered
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
it
may
be
went
on
the
goodman
that
they
passed
him
on
to
some
one
else
to
avoid
suspicion
at
any
rate
he
was
not
with
them
and
we
could
find
no
trace
though
the
savages
undoubtedly
know
some
english
they
refuse
to
say
a
word
and
so
his
fate
remains
a
mystery
what
further
shall
you
do
to
find
him
asked
the
goodwife
see
if
we
can
not
force
the
indians
to
confess
for
the
first
thing
answered
her
husband
his
wife
sighed
i
fear
no
hope
lieth
in
that
direction
she
said
their
faces
were
like
the
granite
of
the
hills
what
of
the
gun
father
asked
daniel
didst
thou
find
it
nay
answered
his
father
they
had
it
not
and
that
causes
me
to
think
they
have
passed
it
as
well
as
the
boy
on
to
others
of
their
tribe
there
is
naught
to
be
done
now
but
wait
until
after
thanksgiving
day
will
be
but
a
sad
holiday
said
the
goodwife
though
he
is
but
a
blackamoor
the
lad
hath
found
a
place
in
my
heart
and
i
grieve
that
evil
hath
befallen
him
when
i
saw
thee
come
out
from
behind
the
i
thought
thou
hadst
a
burden
said
daniel
i
thought
it
was
zeb
wounded
or
mayhap
dead
aye
answered
the
goodman
i
did
carry
a
burden
and
had
like
to
forgot
it
i
dropped
it
by
the
door
of
the
go
thou
and
bring
it
in
dan
ran
out
at
once
and
returned
a
moment
later
carrying
a
huge
wild
turkey
by
the
legs
his
mother
rose
and
felt
its
breastbone
with
her
fingers
is
fine
and
fat
and
young
withal
she
answered
will
make
a
brave
addition
to
our
feast
on
the
morrow
for
truth
to
tell
our
preparations
have
been
but
thus
far
our
minds
were
taken
up
with
thy
danger
and
fear
for
the
lad
dwell
rather
on
our
deliverance
said
her
husband
the
lord
hath
not
brought
us
into
this
wilderness
to
perish
let
us
not
murmur
as
did
the
children
of
israel
the
lord
still
guides
us
aye
and
by
a
pillar
of
fire
too
said
nancy
remembering
the
and
instead
of
manna
he
hath
sent
this
turkey
added
dan
supper
was
now
over
and
after
it
was
cleared
away
and
they
had
had
prayers
the
mother
sent
the
rest
of
the
family
to
bed
while
she
busied
herself
with
final
preparations
for
the
next
day
she
plucked
and
stuffed
the
great
turkey
first
cutting
off
the
long
for
and
set
it
away
on
the
shelf
in
the
secret
closet
along
with
nancy
array
of
pies
it
was
late
when
at
last
she
lit
her
candle
covered
the
ashes
and
climbed
wearily
to
bed
the
wind
changed
in
the
night
and
when
they
looked
out
next
morning
the
air
was
full
of
great
white
and
the
blackened
ruins
of
the
were
neatly
covered
with
a
mantle
of
white
the
family
was
up
betimes
and
as
they
ate
their
good
breakfast
of
sausages
and
maple
syrup
they
sent
many
a
thought
toward
poor
zeb
wandering
in
the
forest
or
perhaps
lying
dead
in
its
depths
it
was
a
solemn
little
party
that
later
left
the
cabin
in
the
care
of
nimrod
and
started
across
the
glistening
fields
to
attend
the
thanksgiving
service
in
the
they
were
made
more
solemn
still
by
the
sight
of
the
two
indians
sitting
with
hands
and
feet
firmly
fixed
in
the
stocks
apparently
as
indifferent
to
the
falling
snow
as
though
they
were
images
of
stone
the
first
snowfall
usually
such
a
joy
to
nancy
and
daniel
now
only
seemed
to
make
them
more
miserable
and
they
were
glad
to
see
the
sun
when
they
came
out
of
the
after
the
sermon
and
turned
their
steps
toward
home
at
least
zeb
would
not
perish
of
cold
if
it
continued
to
shine
they
were
just
beginning
to
climb
the
home
hill
when
they
were
surprised
to
see
nimrod
come
bounding
to
meet
them
barking
a
welcome
how
in
the
world
did
that
dog
get
out
said
the
goodwife
wonderingly
i
shut
him
in
the
kitchen
the
last
thing
before
we
left
the
house
leaving
their
father
and
mother
to
follow
at
a
slower
pace
nancy
and
dan
tore
up
the
hill
and
threw
open
the
kitchen
door
there
comfortably
dozing
on
the
settle
by
the
fire
sat
the
captain
at
his
feet
lay
zeb
also
sound
asleep
with
the
wreckage
of
several
blackened
eggs
strewn
round
him
on
the
the
captain
woke
with
a
start
as
the
children
burst
into
the
room
and
for
an
instant
stood
staring
in
amazement
and
delight
at
the
scene
before
them
zeb
utterly
worn
out
slept
on
and
the
captain
as
usual
was
the
first
to
find
his
tongue
well
well
he
shouted
rubbing
his
nose
to
a
bright
red
to
wake
himself
up
here
ye
be
and
mighty
lucky
too
for
i
hungry
enough
to
eat
a
bear
alive
if
i
could
have
found
out
where
ye
hide
your
supplies
i
might
have
busted
open
to
save
myself
and
this
poor
lad
from
starvation
he
appeared
nigh
as
hungry
as
i
be
but
he
knew
better
how
to
help
himself
he
found
these
eggs
cooked
out
there
in
the
ashes
of
the
and
all
but
et
shells
and
all
never
even
offered
me
a
bite
do
ye
ever
feed
him
before
the
children
could
get
in
a
word
edgewise
their
father
and
mother
followed
by
nimrod
came
in
and
what
with
the
dog
barking
the
children
screaming
explanations
to
the
captain
and
their
own
astonished
exclamations
there
was
such
a
babel
of
noise
that
at
last
zeb
woke
up
too
and
stared
about
him
like
one
dazed
nimrod
jumped
on
him
and
licked
his
face
and
zeb
put
his
arms
around
the
dog
as
if
glad
to
find
so
cordial
a
welcome
the
captain
stared
from
one
face
to
another
quite
unable
to
make
head
or
tail
of
the
situation
illustration
well
by
jolly
he
shouted
at
last
what
ails
ye
all
ye
act
like
a
parcel
of
lunatics
the
goodman
commanded
silence
and
briefly
told
the
whole
story
to
the
captain
where
did
you
find
the
lad
he
asked
when
he
had
finished
he
was
here
when
i
came
said
the
captain
settin
on
the
eatin
them
eggs
as
if
he
had
seen
food
fer
a
and
never
expected
to
see
any
again
the
dog
busted
out
of
the
house
when
i
came
in
and
as
i
could
get
any
word
out
of
the
lad
i
just
set
down
by
the
fire
and
took
forty
winks
it
was
too
late
for
meeting
and
besides
i
reckoned
i
could
sleep
better
here
he
finished
with
his
jolly
laugh
zeb
meanwhile
sat
hugging
the
dog
and
rolling
his
eyes
from
one
face
to
another
as
if
in
utter
bewilderment
perhaps
he
wondered
if
the
captain
meant
to
capture
him
too
for
life
must
have
seemed
to
the
poor
black
boy
just
a
series
of
efforts
to
escape
being
carried
off
to
some
place
where
he
did
not
wish
to
go
by
people
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
the
goodman
at
last
sat
down
before
zeb
on
the
settle
and
tried
to
get
from
him
some
account
of
what
had
happened
in
the
forest
but
zeb
was
totally
unable
to
tell
his
story
his
few
words
of
english
were
inadequate
to
the
recital
of
the
terrors
of
the
past
hours
let
the
lad
be
said
the
goodwife
at
last
he
safe
praise
god
and
we
shall
just
have
to
wait
to
find
out
how
he
managed
to
escape
from
the
savages
and
make
his
way
back
here
she
went
to
the
secret
closet
and
brought
out
a
huge
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
zeb
eyes
gleamed
as
he
seized
it
he
must
eat
too
much
at
once
said
she
as
nearly
as
i
can
make
out
by
the
shells
he
had
six
eggs
already
that
will
do
for
a
time
dan
build
a
fire
in
the
fireplace
in
the
old
kitchen
there
warm
water
in
the
kettle
and
do
thou
see
that
zeb
takes
a
bath
he
is
crusted
with
mud
he
must
have
wallowed
in
it
nancy
and
i
will
get
dinner
the
while
dan
beckoned
to
zeb
and
the
two
boys
disappeared
zeb
had
never
bathed
before
except
in
the
ocean
and
the
new
process
did
not
please
him
i
believe
he
wished
he
stayed
with
the
indians
said
dan
when
he
appeared
an
hour
later
followed
by
a
but
somewhat
embittered
zeb
i
just
about
taken
his
skin
off
and
i
all
worn
out
oh
mother
is
dinner
almost
ready
almost
said
his
mother
as
she
opened
the
oven
door
to
take
a
peep
at
the
turkey
which
had
been
cooking
since
early
morning
it
only
needs
browning
before
the
fire
while
i
make
the
gravy
the
table
was
already
spread
and
nancy
was
at
that
very
moment
giving
an
extra
polish
to
the
tankard
before
placing
it
beside
the
trencher
the
spiced
drink
to
fill
it
was
already
mulling
beside
the
fire
with
a
huge
kettle
of
vegetables
steaming
beside
it
the
closet
door
was
open
giving
a
tantalizing
glimpse
of
glories
to
come
so
there
where
ye
keep
observed
the
captain
regarding
the
pies
with
open
admiration
is
a
sight
to
make
a
man
thankful
for
the
room
in
his
hold
by
jolly
it
take
careful
loading
to
stow
this
dinner
away
proper
he
called
nancy
to
his
side
and
opened
the
bulging
leather
pocket
which
hung
from
his
belt
feel
in
there
he
said
i
brought
along
something
to
fill
in
the
chinks
nancy
thrust
in
her
hand
and
brought
it
out
filled
with
raisins
i
got
off
a
ship
just
in
from
the
indies
explained
the
captain
raisins
were
a
great
luxury
in
the
wilderness
and
the
delighted
nancy
hastened
to
find
a
dish
and
to
place
them
beside
the
pies
all
ready
said
the
mother
at
last
come
to
dinner
there
was
no
need
of
a
second
invitation
and
the
response
to
the
summons
looked
like
a
stampede
the
goodman
and
his
wife
took
their
places
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
the
captain
on
one
side
and
the
children
on
the
other
and
because
it
was
thanksgiving
and
because
he
had
had
such
a
hard
day
and
night
and
most
of
all
because
he
was
so
clean
zeb
was
allowed
a
place
at
the
foot
of
the
board
the
goodman
asked
a
blessing
and
then
heaped
the
trenchers
high
with
what
he
called
the
bounty
of
the
lord
there
was
only
one
cloud
on
dan
sunshine
during
the
meal
on
account
of
zeb
who
when
in
doubt
still
faithfully
imitated
him
he
was
obliged
to
be
an
example
all
through
the
dinner
even
with
such
a
model
to
copy
zeb
had
great
trouble
with
his
spoon
and
showed
a
regrettable
tendency
to
feed
himself
with
both
hands
at
once
the
turkey
was
a
wonder
of
tenderness
the
vegetables
done
to
a
turn
the
indian
pudding
much
better
than
its
name
and
as
for
the
pies
the
captain
declared
they
were
fit
to
be
et
by
the
angels
and
most
too
good
for
a
sinner
like
him
beside
each
plate
the
goodwife
had
placed
a
few
kernels
of
corn
and
at
the
end
of
the
feast
when
the
goodman
rose
to
return
thanks
he
took
them
in
his
hand
in
the
midst
of
plenty
he
said
to
his
children
let
us
not
forget
the
struggles
of
the
past
and
what
we
owe
to
the
pioneers
who
first
adventured
into
this
wilderness
and
made
a
path
for
those
of
us
who
have
followed
them
though
they
nearly
perished
of
hunger
and
cold
in
the
beginning
they
failed
not
in
faith
when
they
had
but
a
few
kernels
of
corn
to
eat
they
still
gave
thanks
choosing
like
daniel
to
live
on
pulse
with
a
good
conscience
rather
than
to
eat
from
a
king
table
as
the
lord
prospered
daniel
so
hath
he
prospered
us
then
they
all
stood
with
folded
hands
and
bent
heads
while
he
gave
thanks
for
the
abundant
harvest
and
prayed
that
they
might
be
guided
to
use
every
blessing
to
the
honor
and
glory
of
god
and
the
captain
said
amen
illustration
suggestions
to
teachers
the
puritan
twins

admirably
supplement
the
study
of
american
history
and
geography
in
grades

the
revival
of
interest
in
all
that
concerns
the
pilgrim
fathers
begun
at
the
time
of
the
tercentenary
in
will
continue
for
many
years
whether
children
are
able
to
trace
their
ancestry
back
to
the
little
band
that
crossed
the
atlantic
in
the
mayflower
or
whether
they
trace
it
to
voyagers
of
a
less
remote
period

the
other
volumes
in
the

series
are
closely
linked
with
many
of
these
later
