anthony

in
when
anthony
patch
was
two
years
were
already
gone
since
irony
the
holy
ghost
of
this
later
day
had
theoretically
at
least
descended
upon
him
irony
was
the
final
polish
of
the
shoe
the
ultimate
dab
of
the
a
sort
of
intellectual
there
yet
at
the
brink
of
this
story
he
has
as
yet
gone
no
further
than
the
conscious
stage
as
you
first
see
him
he
wonders
frequently
whether
he
is
not
without
honor
and
slightly
mad
a
shameful
and
obscene
thinness
glistening
on
the
surface
of
the
world
like
oil
on
a
clean
pond
these
occasions
being
varied
of
course
with
those
in
which
he
thinks
himself
rather
an
exceptional
young
man
thoroughly
sophisticated
well
adjusted
to
his
environment
and
somewhat
more
significant
than
any
one
else
he
knows
this
was
his
healthy
state
and
it
made
him
cheerful
pleasant
and
very
attractive
to
intelligent
men
and
to
all
women
in
this
state
he
considered
that
he
would
one
day
accomplish
some
quiet
subtle
thing
that
the
elect
would
deem
worthy
and
passing
on
would
join
the
dimmer
stars
in
a
nebulous
indeterminate
heaven
between
death
and
immortality
until
the
time
came
for
this
effort
he
would
be
anthony
patch
not
a
portrait
of
a
man
but
a
distinct
and
dynamic
personality
opinionated
contemptuous
functioning
from
within
outward
a
man
who
was
aware
that
there
could
be
no
honor
and
yet
had
honor
who
knew
the
sophistry
of
courage
and
yet
was
brave
a
worthy
man
and
his
gifted
son
anthony
drew
as
much
consciousness
of
social
security
from
being
the
grandson
of
adam
patch
as
he
would
have
had
from
tracing
his
line
over
the
sea
to
the
crusaders
this
is
inevitable
virginians
and
bostonians
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
an
aristocracy
founded
sheerly
on
money
postulates
wealth
in
the
particular
now
adam
patch
more
familiarly
known
as
cross
patch
left
his
father
farm
in
tarrytown
early
in
to
join
a
new
york
cavalry
regiment
he
came
home
from
the
war
a
major
charged
into
wall
street
and
amid
much
fuss
fume
applause
and
ill
will
he
gathered
to
himself
some
million
dollars
this
occupied
his
energies
until
he
was
years
old
it
was
then
that
he
determined
after
a
severe
attack
of
sclerosis
to
consecrate
the
remainder
of
his
life
to
the
moral
regeneration
of
the
world
he
became
a
reformer
among
reformers
emulating
the
magnificent
efforts
of
anthony
comstock
after
whom
his
grandson
was
named
he
levelled
a
varied
assortment
of
uppercuts
and
at
liquor
literature
vice
art
patent
medicines
and
sunday
theatres
his
mind
under
the
influence
of
that
insidious
mildew
which
eventually
forms
on
all
but
the
few
gave
itself
up
furiously
to
every
indignation
of
the
age
from
an
armchair
in
the
office
of
his
tarrytown
estate
he
directed
against
the
enormous
hypothetical
enemy
unrighteousness
a
campaign
which
went
on
through
fifteen
years
during
which
he
displayed
himself
a
rabid
monomaniac
an
unqualified
nuisance
and
an
intolerable
bore
the
year
in
which
this
story
opens
found
him
wearying
his
campaign
had
grown
desultory
was
creeping
up
slowly
on
his
thoughts
ran
a
great
deal
on
the
civil
war
somewhat
on
his
dead
wife
and
son
almost
infinitesimally
on
his
grandson
anthony
early
in
his
career
adam
patch
had
married
an
anemic
lady
of
thirty
alicia
withers
who
brought
him
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
an
impeccable
entré
into
the
banking
circles
of
new
york
immediately
and
rather
spunkily
she
had
borne
him
a
son
and
as
if
completely
devitalized
by
the
magnificence
of
this
performance
she
had
thenceforth
effaced
herself
within
the
shadowy
dimensions
of
the
nursery
the
boy
adam
ulysses
patch
became
an
inveterate
joiner
of
clubs
connoisseur
of
good
form
and
driver
of
tandems
at
the
astonishing
age
of
he
began
his
memoirs
under
the
title
new
york
society
as
i
have
seen
it
on
the
rumor
of
its
conception
this
work
was
eagerly
bid
for
among
publishers
but
as
it
proved
after
his
death
to
be
immoderately
verbose
and
overpoweringly
dull
it
never
obtained
even
a
private
printing
this
fifth
avenue
chesterfield
married
at
his
wife
was
henrietta
lebrune
the
boston
society
contralto
and
the
single
child
of
the
union
was
at
the
request
of
his
grandfather
christened
anthony
comstock
patch
when
he
went
to
harvard
the
comstock
dropped
out
of
his
name
to
a
nether
hell
of
oblivion
and
was
never
heard
of
thereafter
young
anthony
had
one
picture
of
his
father
and
mother
together
so
often
had
it
faced
his
eyes
in
childhood
that
it
had
acquired
the
impersonality
of
furniture
but
every
one
who
came
into
his
bedroom
regarded
it
with
interest
it
showed
a
dandy
of
the
nineties
spare
and
handsome
standing
beside
a
tall
dark
lady
with
a
muff
and
the
suggestion
of
a
bustle
between
them
was
a
little
boy
with
long
brown
curls
dressed
in
a
velvet
lord
fauntleroy
suit
this
was
anthony
at
five
the
year
of
his
mother
death
his
memories
of
the
boston
society
contralto
were
nebulous
and
musical
she
was
a
lady
who
sang
sang
sang
in
the
music
room
of
their
house
on
washington
square
sometimes
with
guests
scattered
all
about
her
the
men
with
their
arms
folded
balanced
breathlessly
on
the
edges
of
sofas
the
women
with
their
hands
in
their
laps
occasionally
making
little
whispers
to
the
men
and
always
clapping
very
briskly
and
uttering
cooing
cries
after
each
song
and
often
she
sang
to
anthony
alone
in
italian
or
french
or
in
a
strange
and
terrible
dialect
which
she
imagined
to
be
the
speech
of
the
southern
negro
his
recollections
of
the
gallant
ulysses
the
first
man
in
america
to
roll
the
lapels
of
his
coat
were
much
more
vivid
after
henrietta
lebrune
patch
had
joined
another
choir
as
her
widower
huskily
remarked
from
time
to
time
father
and
son
lived
up
at
grampa
in
tarrytown
and
ulysses
came
daily
to
anthony
nursery
and
expelled
pleasant
words
for
sometimes
as
much
as
an
hour
he
was
continually
promising
anthony
hunting
trips
and
fishing
trips
and
excursions
to
atlantic
city
oh
some
time
soon
now
but
none
of
them
ever
materialized
one
trip
they
did
take
when
anthony
was
eleven
they
went
abroad
to
england
and
switzerland
and
there
in
the
best
hotel
in
lucerne
his
father
died
with
much
sweating
and
grunting
and
crying
aloud
for
air
in
a
panic
of
despair
and
terror
anthony
was
brought
back
to
america
wedded
to
a
vague
melancholy
that
was
to
stay
beside
him
through
the
rest
of
his
life
past
and
person
of
the
hero
at
eleven
he
had
a
horror
of
death
within
six
impressionable
years
his
parents
had
died
and
his
grandmother
had
faded
off
almost
imperceptibly
until
for
the
first
time
since
her
marriage
her
person
held
for
one
day
an
unquestioned
supremacy
over
her
own
drawing
room
so
to
anthony
life
was
a
struggle
against
death
that
waited
at
every
corner
it
was
as
a
concession
to
his
hypochondriacal
imagination
that
he
formed
the
habit
of
reading
in
bed
it
soothed
him
he
read
until
he
was
tired
and
often
fell
asleep
with
the
lights
still
on
his
favorite
diversion
until
he
was
fourteen
was
his
stamp
collection
enormous
as
nearly
exhaustive
as
a
boy
could
be
his
grandfather
considered
fatuously
that
it
was
teaching
him
geography
so
anthony
kept
up
a
correspondence
with
a
half
dozen
stamp
and
coin
companies
and
it
was
rare
that
the
mail
failed
to
bring
him
new
or
packages
of
glittering
approval
sheets
there
was
a
mysterious
fascination
in
transferring
his
acquisitions
interminably
from
one
book
to
another
his
stamps
were
his
greatest
happiness
and
he
bestowed
impatient
frowns
on
any
one
who
interrupted
him
at
play
with
them
they
devoured
his
allowance
every
month
and
he
lay
awake
at
night
musing
untiringly
on
their
variety
and
splendor
at
sixteen
he
had
lived
almost
entirely
within
himself
an
inarticulate
boy
thoroughly
and
politely
bewildered
by
his
contemporaries
the
two
preceding
years
had
been
spent
in
europe
with
a
private
tutor
who
persuaded
him
that
harvard
was
the
thing
it
would
open
doors
it
would
be
a
tremendous
tonic
it
would
give
him
innumerable
and
devoted
friends
so
he
went
to
harvard
there
was
no
other
logical
thing
to
be
done
with
him
oblivious
to
the
social
system
he
lived
for
a
while
alone
and
unsought
in
a
high
room
in
beck
hall
a
slim
dark
boy
of
medium
height
with
a
shy
sensitive
mouth
his
allowance
was
more
than
liberal
he
laid
the
foundations
for
a
library
by
purchasing
from
a
wandering
bibliophile
first
editions
of
swinburne
meredith
and
hardy
and
a
yellowed
illegible
autograph
letter
of
keats
finding
later
that
he
had
been
amazingly
overcharged
he
became
an
exquisite
dandy
amassed
a
rather
pathetic
collection
of
silk
pajamas
brocaded
and
neckties
too
flamboyant
to
wear
in
this
secret
finery
he
would
parade
before
a
mirror
in
his
room
or
lie
stretched
in
satin
along
his
looking
down
on
the
yard
and
realizing
dimly
this
clamor
breathless
and
immediate
in
which
it
seemed
he
was
never
to
have
a
part
curiously
enough
he
found
in
senior
year
that
he
had
acquired
a
position
in
his
class
he
learned
that
he
was
looked
upon
as
a
rather
romantic
figure
a
scholar
a
recluse
a
tower
of
erudition
this
amused
him
but
secretly
pleased
him
he
began
going
out
at
first
a
little
and
then
a
great
deal
he
made
the
pudding
he
drank
quietly
and
in
the
proper
tradition
it
was
said
of
him
that
had
he
not
come
to
college
so
young
he
might
have
done
extremely
well
in
when
he
graduated
he
was
only
twenty
years
old
then
abroad
again
to
rome
this
time
where
he
dallied
with
architecture
and
painting
in
turn
took
up
the
violin
and
wrote
some
ghastly
italian
sonnets
supposedly
the
ruminations
of
a
monk
on
the
joys
of
the
contemplative
life
it
became
established
among
his
harvard
intimates
that
he
was
in
rome
and
those
of
them
who
were
abroad
that
year
looked
him
up
and
discovered
with
him
on
many
moonlight
excursions
much
in
the
city
that
was
older
than
the
renaissance
or
indeed
than
the
republic
maury
noble
from
philadelphia
for
instance
remained
two
months
and
together
they
realized
the
peculiar
charm
of
latin
women
and
had
a
delightful
sense
of
being
very
young
and
free
in
a
civilization
that
was
very
old
and
free
not
a
few
acquaintances
of
his
grandfather
called
on
him
and
had
he
so
desired
he
might
have
been
with
the
diplomatic
set
indeed
he
found
that
his
inclinations
tended
more
and
more
toward
conviviality
but
that
long
adolescent
aloofness
and
consequent
shyness
still
dictated
to
his
conduct
he
returned
to
america
in
because
of
one
of
his
sudden
illnesses
and
after
an
excessively
tiresome
talk
with
the
perpetually
convalescent
old
man
he
decided
to
put
off
until
his
grandfather
death
the
idea
of
living
permanently
abroad
after
a
prolonged
search
he
took
an
apartment
on
street
and
to
all
appearances
settled
down
in
anthony
patch
adjustment
of
himself
to
the
universe
was
in
process
of
consummation
physically
he
had
improved
since
his
undergraduate
days
he
was
still
too
thin
but
his
shoulders
had
widened
and
his
brunette
face
had
lost
the
frightened
look
of
his
freshman
year
he
was
secretly
orderly
and
in
person
spick
and
span
his
friends
declared
that
they
had
never
seen
his
hair
rumpled
his
nose
was
too
sharp
his
mouth
was
one
of
those
unfortunate
mirrors
of
mood
inclined
to
droop
perceptibly
in
moments
of
unhappiness
but
his
blue
eyes
were
charming
whether
alert
with
intelligence
or
half
closed
in
an
expression
of
melancholy
humor
one
of
those
men
devoid
of
the
symmetry
of
feature
essential
to
the
aryan
ideal
he
was
yet
here
and
there
considered
handsome
moreover
he
was
very
clean
in
appearance
and
in
reality
with
that
especial
cleanness
borrowed
from
beauty
the
reproachless
apartment
fifth
and
sixth
avenues
it
seemed
to
anthony
were
the
uprights
of
a
gigantic
ladder
stretching
from
washington
square
to
central
park
coming
on
top
of
a
bus
toward
street
invariably
gave
him
the
sensation
of
hoisting
himself
hand
by
hand
on
a
series
of
treacherous
rungs
and
when
the
bus
jolted
to
a
stop
at
his
own
rung
he
found
something
akin
to
relief
as
he
descended
the
reckless
metal
steps
to
the
sidewalk
after
that
he
had
but
to
walk
down
street
half
a
block
pass
a
stodgy
family
of
brownstone
houses
and
then
in
a
jiffy
he
was
under
the
high
ceilings
of
his
great
front
room
this
was
entirely
satisfactory
here
after
all
life
began
here
he
slept
breakfasted
read
and
entertained
the
house
itself
was
of
murky
material
built
in
the
late
nineties
in
response
to
the
steadily
growing
need
of
small
apartments
each
floor
had
been
thoroughly
remodelled
and
rented
individually
of
the
four
apartments
anthony
on
the
second
floor
was
the
most
desirable
the
front
room
had
fine
high
ceilings
and
three
large
windows
that
loomed
down
pleasantly
upon
street
in
its
appointments
it
escaped
by
a
safe
margin
being
of
any
particular
period
it
escaped
stiffness
stuffiness
bareness
and
decadence
it
smelt
neither
of
smoke
nor
of
incense
it
was
tall
and
faintly
blue
there
was
a
deep
lounge
of
the
softest
brown
leather
with
somnolence
drifting
about
it
like
a
haze
there
was
a
high
screen
of
chinese
lacquer
chiefly
concerned
with
geometrical
fishermen
and
huntsmen
in
black
and
gold
this
made
a
corner
alcove
for
a
voluminous
chair
guarded
by
an
standing
lamp
deep
in
the
fireplace
a
quartered
shield
was
burned
to
a
murky
black
passing
through
the
which
as
anthony
took
only
breakfast
at
home
was
merely
a
magnificent
potentiality
and
down
a
comparatively
long
hall
one
came
to
the
heart
and
core
of
the
apartment
bedroom
and
bath
both
of
them
were
immense
under
the
ceilings
of
the
former
even
the
great
canopied
bed
seemed
of
only
average
size
on
the
floor
an
exotic
rug
of
crimson
velvet
was
soft
as
fleece
on
his
bare
feet
his
bathroom
in
contrast
to
the
rather
portentous
character
of
his
bedroom
was
gay
bright
extremely
habitable
and
even
faintly
facetious
framed
around
the
walls
were
photographs
of
four
celebrated
thespian
beauties
of
the
day
julia
sanderson
as
the
sunshine
girl
ina
claire
as
the
quaker
girl
billie
burke
as
the
girl
and
hazel
dawn
as
the
pink
lady
between
billie
burke
and
hazel
dawn
hung
a
print
representing
a
great
stretch
of
snow
presided
over
by
a
cold
and
formidable
sun
this
claimed
anthony
symbolized
the
cold
shower
the
bathtub
equipped
with
an
ingenious
bookholder
was
low
and
large
beside
it
a
wall
wardrobe
bulged
with
sufficient
linen
for
three
men
and
with
a
generation
of
neckties
there
was
no
skimpy
glorified
towel
of
a
carpet
instead
a
rich
rug
like
the
one
in
his
bedroom
a
miracle
of
softness
that
seemed
almost
to
massage
the
wet
foot
emerging
from
the
tub
all
in
all
a
room
to
conjure
with
it
was
easy
to
see
that
anthony
dressed
there
arranged
his
immaculate
hair
there
in
fact
did
everything
but
sleep
and
eat
there
it
was
his
pride
this
bathroom
he
felt
that
if
he
had
a
love
he
would
have
hung
her
picture
just
facing
the
tub
so
that
lost
in
the
soothing
steamings
of
the
hot
water
he
might
lie
and
look
up
at
her
and
muse
warmly
and
sensuously
on
her
beauty
nor
does
he
spin
the
apartment
was
kept
clean
by
an
english
servant
with
the
singularly
almost
theatrically
appropriate
name
of
bounds
whose
technic
was
marred
only
by
the
fact
that
he
wore
a
soft
collar
had
he
been
entirely
anthony
bounds
this
defect
would
have
been
summarily
remedied
but
he
was
also
the
bounds
of
two
other
gentlemen
in
the
neighborhood
from
eight
until
eleven
in
the
morning
he
was
entirely
anthony
he
arrived
with
the
mail
and
cooked
breakfast
at
he
pulled
the
edge
of
anthony
blanket
and
spoke
a
few
terse
words
anthony
never
remembered
clearly
what
they
were
and
rather
suspected
they
were
deprecative
then
he
served
breakfast
on
a
in
the
front
room
made
the
bed
and
after
asking
with
some
hostility
if
there
was
anything
else
withdrew
in
the
mornings
at
least
once
a
week
anthony
went
to
see
his
broker
his
income
was
slightly
under
seven
thousand
a
year
the
interest
on
money
inherited
from
his
mother
his
grandfather
who
had
never
allowed
his
own
son
to
graduate
from
a
very
liberal
allowance
judged
that
this
sum
was
sufficient
for
young
anthony
needs
every
christmas
he
sent
him
a
bond
which
anthony
usually
sold
if
possible
as
he
was
always
a
little
not
very
hard
up
the
visits
to
his
broker
varied
from
chats
to
discussions
of
the
safety
of
eight
per
cent
investments
and
anthony
always
enjoyed
them
the
big
trust
company
building
seemed
to
link
him
definitely
to
the
great
fortunes
whose
solidarity
he
respected
and
to
assure
him
that
he
was
adequately
chaperoned
by
the
hierarchy
of
finance
from
these
hurried
men
he
derived
the
same
sense
of
safety
that
he
had
in
contemplating
his
grandfather
money
even
more
for
the
latter
appeared
vaguely
a
demand
loan
made
by
the
world
to
adam
patch
own
moral
righteousness
while
this
money
seemed
rather
to
have
been
grasped
and
held
by
sheer
indomitable
strengths
and
tremendous
feats
of
will
in
addition
it
seemed
more
definitely
and
explicitly
money
closely
as
anthony
trod
on
the
heels
of
his
income
he
considered
it
to
be
enough
some
golden
day
of
course
he
would
have
many
millions
meanwhile
he
possessed
a
in
the
theoretical
creation
of
essays
on
the
popes
of
the
renaissance
this
flashes
back
to
the
conversation
with
his
grandfather
immediately
upon
his
return
from
rome
he
had
hoped
to
find
his
grandfather
dead
but
had
learned
by
telephoning
from
the
pier
that
adam
patch
was
comparatively
well
again
the
next
day
he
had
concealed
his
disappointment
and
gone
out
to
tarrytown
five
miles
from
the
station
his
taxicab
entered
an
elaborately
groomed
drive
that
threaded
a
veritable
maze
of
walls
and
wire
fences
guarding
the
estate
this
said
the
public
was
because
it
was
definitely
known
that
if
the
socialists
had
their
way
one
of
the
first
men
they
assassinate
would
be
old
cross
patch
anthony
was
late
and
the
venerable
philanthropist
was
awaiting
him
in
a
sun
parlor
where
he
was
glancing
through
the
morning
papers
for
the
second
time
his
secretary
edward
shuttleworth
who
before
his
regeneration
had
been
gambler
and
general
reprobate
ushered
anthony
into
the
room
exhibiting
his
redeemer
and
benefactor
as
though
he
were
displaying
a
treasure
of
immense
value
they
shook
hands
gravely
i
awfully
glad
to
hear
you
better
anthony
said
the
senior
patch
with
an
air
of
having
seen
his
grandson
only
last
week
pulled
out
his
watch
train
late
he
asked
mildly
it
had
irritated
him
to
wait
for
anthony
he
was
under
the
delusion
not
only
that
in
his
youth
he
had
handled
his
practical
affairs
with
the
utmost
scrupulousness
even
to
keeping
every
engagement
on
the
dot
but
also
that
this
was
the
direct
and
primary
cause
of
his
success
it
been
late
a
good
deal
this
month
he
remarked
with
a
shade
of
meek
accusation
in
his
voice
and
then
after
a
long
sigh
sit
down
anthony
surveyed
his
grandfather
with
that
tacit
amazement
which
always
attended
the
sight
that
this
feeble
unintelligent
old
man
was
possessed
of
such
power
that
yellow
journals
to
the
contrary
the
men
in
the
republic
whose
souls
he
could
not
have
bought
directly
or
indirectly
would
scarcely
have
populated
white
plains
seemed
as
impossible
to
believe
as
that
he
had
once
been
a
baby
the
span
of
his
years
had
acted
as
a
magic
bellows
the
first
had
blown
him
full
with
life
and
the
last
had
sucked
it
all
back
it
had
sucked
in
the
cheeks
and
the
chest
and
the
girth
of
arm
and
leg
it
had
tyrannously
demanded
his
teeth
one
by
one
suspended
his
small
eyes
in
sacks
tweeked
out
his
hairs
changed
him
from
gray
to
white
in
some
places
from
pink
to
yellow
in
others
callously
transposing
his
colors
like
a
child
trying
over
a
paintbox
then
through
his
body
and
his
soul
it
had
attacked
his
brain
it
had
sent
him
and
tears
and
unfounded
dreads
it
had
split
his
intense
normality
into
credulity
and
suspicion
out
of
the
coarse
material
of
his
enthusiasm
it
had
cut
dozens
of
meek
but
petulant
obsessions
his
energy
was
shrunk
to
the
bad
temper
of
a
spoiled
child
and
for
his
will
to
power
was
substituted
a
fatuous
puerile
desire
for
a
land
of
harps
and
canticles
on
earth
the
amenities
having
been
gingerly
touched
upon
anthony
felt
that
he
was
expected
to
outline
his
intentions
and
simultaneously
a
glimmer
in
the
old
man
eye
warned
him
against
broaching
for
the
present
his
desire
to
live
abroad
he
wished
that
shuttleworth
would
have
tact
enough
to
leave
the
room
he
detested
shuttleworth
but
the
secretary
had
settled
blandly
in
a
rocker
and
was
dividing
between
the
two
patches
the
glances
of
his
faded
eyes
now
that
you
here
you
ought
to
something
said
his
grandfather
softly
accomplish
something
anthony
waited
for
him
to
speak
of
leaving
something
done
when
you
pass
on
then
he
made
a
suggestion
i
thought
it
seemed
to
me
that
perhaps
i
best
qualified
to
write
adam
patch
winced
visualizing
a
family
poet
with
a
long
hair
and
three
history
finished
anthony
history
history
of
what
the
civil
war
the
revolution
why
no
sir
a
history
of
the
middle
ages
simultaneously
an
idea
was
born
for
a
history
of
the
renaissance
popes
written
from
some
novel
angle
still
he
was
glad
he
had
said
middle
ages
middle
ages
why
not
your
own
country
something
you
know
about
well
you
see
i
lived
so
much
abroad
why
you
should
write
about
the
middle
ages
i
do
know
dark
ages
we
used
to
call
nobody
knows
what
happened
and
nobody
cares
except
that
they
over
now
he
continued
for
some
minutes
on
the
uselessness
of
such
information
touching
naturally
on
the
spanish
inquisition
and
the
corruption
of
the
monasteries
then
do
you
think
you
be
able
to
do
any
work
in
new
york
or
do
you
really
intend
to
work
at
all
this
last
with
soft
almost
imperceptible
cynicism
why
yes
i
do
sir
when
you
be
done
well
there
be
an
outline
you
see
and
a
lot
of
preliminary
reading
i
should
think
you
have
done
enough
of
that
already
the
conversation
worked
itself
jerkily
toward
a
rather
abrupt
conclusion
when
anthony
rose
looked
at
his
watch
and
remarked
that
he
had
an
engagement
with
his
broker
that
afternoon
he
had
intended
to
stay
a
few
days
with
his
grandfather
but
he
was
tired
and
irritated
from
a
rough
crossing
and
quite
unwilling
to
stand
a
subtle
and
sanctimonious
browbeating
he
would
come
out
again
in
a
few
days
he
said
nevertheless
it
was
due
to
this
encounter
that
work
had
come
into
his
life
as
a
permanent
idea
during
the
year
that
had
passed
since
then
he
had
made
several
lists
of
authorities
he
had
even
experimented
with
chapter
titles
and
the
division
of
his
work
into
periods
but
not
one
line
of
actual
writing
existed
at
present
or
seemed
likely
ever
to
exist
he
did
nothing
and
contrary
to
the
most
accredited
logic
he
managed
to
divert
himself
with
more
than
average
content
afternoon
it
was
october
in
midway
in
a
week
of
pleasant
days
with
the
sunshine
loitering
in
the
and
the
atmosphere
so
languid
as
to
seem
weighted
with
ghostly
falling
leaves
it
was
pleasant
to
sit
lazily
by
the
open
window
finishing
a
chapter
of
erewhon
it
was
pleasant
to
yawn
about
five
toss
the
book
on
a
table
and
saunter
humming
along
the
hall
to
his
bath
to
you
lady
he
was
singing
as
he
turned
on
the
tap
i
raise
my
eyes
to
you
my
heart
cries
he
raised
his
voice
to
compete
with
the
flood
of
water
pouring
into
the
tub
and
as
he
looked
at
the
picture
of
hazel
dawn
upon
the
wall
he
put
an
imaginary
violin
to
his
shoulder
and
softly
caressed
it
with
a
phantom
bow
through
his
closed
lips
he
made
a
humming
noise
which
he
vaguely
imagined
resembled
the
sound
of
a
violin
after
a
moment
his
hands
ceased
their
gyrations
and
wandered
to
his
shirt
which
he
began
to
unfasten
stripped
and
adopting
an
athletic
posture
like
the
man
in
the
advertisement
he
regarded
himself
with
some
satisfaction
in
the
mirror
breaking
off
to
dabble
a
tentative
foot
in
the
tub
readjusting
a
faucet
and
indulging
in
a
few
preliminary
grunts
he
slid
in
once
accustomed
to
the
temperature
of
the
water
he
relaxed
into
a
state
of
drowsy
content
when
he
finished
his
bath
he
would
dress
leisurely
and
walk
down
fifth
avenue
to
the
ritz
where
he
had
an
appointment
for
dinner
with
his
two
most
frequent
companions
dick
caramel
and
maury
noble
afterward
he
and
maury
were
going
to
the
theatre
caramel
would
probably
trot
home
and
work
on
his
book
which
ought
to
be
finished
pretty
soon
anthony
was
glad
was
going
to
work
on
book
the
notion
of
sitting
down
and
conjuring
up
not
only
words
in
which
to
clothe
thoughts
but
thoughts
worthy
of
being
clothed
the
whole
thing
was
absurdly
beyond
his
desires
emerging
from
his
bath
he
polished
himself
with
the
meticulous
attention
of
a
bootblack
then
he
wandered
into
the
bedroom
and
whistling
the
while
a
weird
uncertain
melody
strolled
here
and
there
buttoning
adjusting
and
enjoying
the
warmth
of
the
thick
carpet
on
his
feet
he
lit
a
cigarette
tossed
the
match
out
the
open
top
of
the
window
then
paused
in
his
tracks
with
the
cigarette
two
inches
from
his
mouth
which
fell
faintly
ajar
his
eyes
were
focussed
upon
a
spot
of
brilliant
color
on
the
roof
of
a
house
farther
down
the
alley
it
was
a
girl
in
a
red
negligé
silk
surely
drying
her
hair
by
the
still
hot
sun
of
late
afternoon
his
whistle
died
upon
the
stiff
air
of
the
room
he
walked
cautiously
another
step
nearer
the
window
with
a
sudden
impression
that
she
was
beautiful
sitting
on
the
stone
parapet
beside
her
was
a
cushion
the
same
color
as
her
garment
and
she
was
leaning
both
arms
upon
it
as
she
looked
down
into
the
sunny
areaway
where
anthony
could
hear
children
playing
he
watched
her
for
several
minutes
something
was
stirred
in
him
something
not
accounted
for
by
the
warm
smell
of
the
afternoon
or
the
triumphant
vividness
of
red
he
felt
persistently
that
the
girl
was
beautiful
then
of
a
sudden
he
understood
it
was
her
distance
not
a
rare
and
precious
distance
of
soul
but
still
distance
if
only
in
terrestrial
yards
the
autumn
air
was
between
them
and
the
roofs
and
the
blurred
voices
yet
for
a
not
altogether
explained
second
posing
perversely
in
time
his
emotion
had
been
nearer
to
adoration
than
in
the
deepest
kiss
he
had
ever
known
he
finished
his
dressing
found
a
black
bow
tie
and
adjusted
it
carefully
by
the
mirror
in
the
bathroom
then
yielding
to
an
impulse
he
walked
quickly
into
the
bedroom
and
again
looked
out
the
window
the
woman
was
standing
up
now
she
had
tossed
her
hair
back
and
he
had
a
full
view
of
her
she
was
fat
full
utterly
undistinguished
making
a
clicking
noise
with
his
mouth
he
returned
to
the
bathroom
and
reparted
his
hair
to
you
lady
he
sang
lightly
i
raise
my
eyes
then
with
a
last
soothing
brush
that
left
an
iridescent
surface
of
sheer
gloss
he
left
his
bathroom
and
his
apartment
and
walked
down
fifth
avenue
to
the
three
men
at
seven
anthony
and
his
friend
maury
noble
are
sitting
at
a
corner
table
on
the
cool
roof
maury
noble
is
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
large
slender
and
imposing
cat
his
eyes
are
narrow
and
full
of
incessant
protracted
blinks
his
hair
is
smooth
and
flat
as
though
it
has
been
licked
by
a
possible
and
if
so
herculean
during
anthony
time
at
harvard
he
had
been
considered
the
most
unique
figure
in
his
class
the
most
brilliant
the
most
original
smart
quiet
and
among
the
saved
this
is
the
man
whom
anthony
considers
his
best
friend
this
is
the
only
man
of
all
his
acquaintance
whom
he
admires
and
to
a
bigger
extent
than
he
likes
to
admit
to
himself
envies
they
are
glad
to
see
each
other
now
their
eyes
are
full
of
kindness
as
each
feels
the
full
effect
of
novelty
after
a
short
separation
they
are
drawing
a
relaxation
from
each
other
presence
a
new
serenity
maury
noble
behind
that
fine
and
absurdly
catlike
face
is
all
but
purring
and
anthony
nervous
as
a
restless
he
is
at
rest
now
they
are
engaged
in
one
of
those
easy
conversations
that
only
men
under
thirty
or
men
under
great
stress
indulge
in
anthony
seven
where
the
caramel
impatiently
i
wish
he
finish
that
interminable
novel
i
spent
more
time
hungry
maury
he
got
a
new
name
for
it
the
demon
lover
not
bad
eh
anthony
interested
the
demon
lover
oh
woman
wailing
no
not
a
bit
bad
not
bad
at
all
think
maury
rather
good
what
time
did
you
say
anthony
seven
maury
his
eyes
narrowing
not
unpleasantly
but
to
express
a
faint
disapproval
drove
me
crazy
the
other
day
anthony
how
maury
that
habit
of
taking
notes
anthony
me
too
seems
i
said
something
night
before
that
he
considered
material
but
he
forgotten
it
so
he
had
at
me
he
say
ca
you
try
to
concentrate
and
i
say
you
bore
me
to
tears
how
do
i
remember
maury
laughs
noiselessly
by
a
sort
of
bland
and
appreciative
widening
of
his
features
maury
dick
does
necessarily
see
more
than
any
one
else
he
merely
can
put
down
a
larger
proportion
of
what
he
sees
anthony
that
rather
impressive
talent
maury
oh
yes
impressive
anthony
and
energy
ambitious
energy
he
so
entertaining
he
so
tremendously
stimulating
and
exciting
often
there
something
breathless
in
being
with
him
maury
oh
yes
silence
and
then
anthony
with
his
thin
somewhat
uncertain
face
at
its
most
convinced
not
indomitable
energy
some
day
bit
by
bit
it
blow
away
and
his
rather
impressive
talent
with
it
and
leave
only
a
wisp
of
a
man
fretful
and
egotistic
and
garrulous
maury
with
laughter
here
we
sit
vowing
to
each
other
that
little
dick
sees
less
deeply
into
things
than
we
do
and
i
bet
he
feels
a
measure
of
superiority
on
his
side
creative
mind
over
merely
critical
mind
and
all
that
anthony
oh
yes
but
he
wrong
he
inclined
to
fall
for
a
million
silly
enthusiasms
if
it
was
that
he
absorbed
in
realism
and
therefore
has
to
adopt
the
garments
of
the
cynic
he
be
he
be
credulous
as
a
college
religious
leader
he
an
idealist
oh
yes
he
thinks

he
rejected
christianity

bald

he
has
yellowish
eyes
one
of
them
startlingly
clear
the
other
opaque
as
a
muddy
pool
and
a
bulging
brow
like
a
baby
he
bulges
in
other
places
his
paunch
bulges
prophetically
his
words
have
an
air
of
bulging
from
his
mouth
even
his
dinner
coat
pockets
bulge
as
though
from
contamination
with
a
collection
of
programmes
and
miscellaneous
scraps
on
these
he
takes
his
notes
with
great
screwings
up
of
his
unmatched
yellow
eyes
and
motions
of
silence
with
his
disengaged
left
he
reaches
the
table
he
shakes
hands
with
anthony
and
maury
he
is
one
of
those
men
who
invariably
shake
hands
even
with
people
whom
they
have
seen
an
hour
anthony
hello
caramel
glad
you
here
we
needed
a
comic
relief
maury
you
late
been
racing
the
postman
down
the
block
we
been
clawing
over
your
character
dick
anthony
with
the
bright
what
you
say
tell
me
and
i
write
it
down
cut
three
thousand
words
out
of
part
one
this
afternoon
maury
noble
aesthete
and
i
poured
alcohol
into
my
stomach
dick
i
do
doubt
it
i
bet
you
two
have
been
sitting
here
for
an
hour
talking
about
liquor
anthony
we
never
pass
out
my
beardless
boy
maury
we
never
go
home
with
ladies
we
meet
when
we
lit
anthony
all
in
our
parties
are
characterized
by
a
certain
haughty
distinction
dick
the
particularly
silly
sort
who
boast
about
being
tanks
trouble
is
you
both
in
the
eighteenth
century
school
of
the
old
english
squire
drink
quietly
until
you
roll
under
the
table
never
have
a
good
time
oh
no
that
is
done
at
all
anthony
this
from
chapter
six
i
bet
dick
going
to
the
theatre
maury
yes
we
intend
to
spend
the
evening
doing
some
deep
thinking
over
of
life
problems
the
thing
is
tersely
called
the
woman
i
presume
that
she
will
pay
anthony
my
god
is
that
what
it
is
let
go
to
the
follies
again
maury
i
tired
of
it
i
seen
it
three
times
dick
the
first
time
we
went
out
after
act
one
and
found
a
most
amazing
bar
when
we
came
back
we
entered
the
wrong
theatre
anthony
had
a
protracted
dispute
with
a
scared
young
couple
we
thought
were
in
our
seats
dick
though
talking
to
i
think
that
when
i
done
another
novel
and
a
play
and
maybe
a
book
of
short
stories
i
do
a
musical
comedy
maury
i
know
with
intellectual
lyrics
that
no
one
will
listen
to
and
all
the
critics
will
groan
and
grunt
about
dear
old
pinafore
and
i
shall
go
on
shining
as
a
brilliantly
meaningless
figure
in
a
meaningless
world
dick
art
is
meaningless
maury
it
is
in
itself
it
is
in
that
it
tries
to
make
life
less
so
anthony
in
other
words
dick
you
playing
before
a
grand
stand
peopled
with
ghosts
maury
give
a
good
show
anyhow
anthony
to
maury
on
the
contrary
i
feel
that
it
being
a
meaningless
world
why
write
the
very
attempt
to
give
it
purpose
is
purposeless
dick
well
even
admitting
all
that
be
a
decent
pragmatist
and
grant
a
poor
man
the
instinct
to
live
would
you
want
every
one
to
accept
that
sophistic
rot
anthony
yeah
i
suppose
so
maury
no
sir
i
believe
that
every
one
in
america
but
a
selected
thousand
should
be
compelled
to
accept
a
very
rigid
system
of
morals
roman
catholicism
for
instance
i
do
complain
of
conventional
morality
i
complain
rather
of
the
mediocre
heretics
who
seize
upon
the
findings
of
sophistication
and
adopt
the
pose
of
a
moral
freedom
to
which
they
are
by
no
means
entitled
by
their
intelligences
the
soup
arrives
and
what
maury
might
have
gone
on
to
say
is
lost
for
all
night
afterward
they
visited
a
ticket
speculator
and
at
a
price
obtained
seats
for
a
new
musical
comedy
called
high
jinks
in
the
foyer
of
the
theatre
they
waited
a
few
moments
to
see
the
crowd
come
in
there
were
opera
cloaks
stitched
of
myriad
silks
and
furs
there
were
jewels
dripping
from
arms
and
throats
and
of
white
and
rose
there
were
innumerable
broad
shimmers
down
the
middles
of
innumerable
silk
hats
there
were
shoes
of
gold
and
bronze
and
red
and
shining
black
there
were
the
coiffures
of
many
women
and
the
slick
watered
hair
of
men
most
of
all
there
was
the
ebbing
flowing
chattering
chuckling
foaming
wave
effect
of
this
cheerful
sea
of
people
as
it
poured
its
glittering
torrent
into
the
artificial
lake
of
laughter
after
the
play
they
parted
maury
was
going
to
a
dance
at
sherry
anthony
homeward
and
to
bed
he
found
his
way
slowly
over
the
jostled
evening
mass
of
times
square
which
the
chariot
race
and
its
thousand
satellites
made
rarely
beautiful
and
bright
and
intimate
with
carnival
faces
swirled
about
him
a
kaleidoscope
of
girls
ugly
ugly
as
sin
too
fat
too
lean
yet
floating
upon
this
autumn
air
as
upon
their
own
warm
and
passionate
breaths
poured
out
into
the
night
here
for
all
their
vulgarity
he
thought
they
were
faintly
and
subtly
mysterious
he
inhaled
carefully
swallowing
into
his
lungs
perfume
and
the
not
unpleasant
scent
of
many
cigarettes
he
caught
the
glance
of
a
dark
young
beauty
sitting
alone
in
a
closed
taxicab
her
eyes
in
the
suggested
night
and
violets
and
for
a
moment
he
stirred
again
to
that
remoteness
of
the
afternoon
two
young
jewish
men
passed
him
talking
in
loud
voices
and
craning
their
necks
here
and
there
in
fatuous
supercilious
glances
they
were
dressed
in
suits
of
the
exaggerated
tightness
then
their
turned
over
collars
were
notched
at
the
adam
apple
they
wore
gray
spats
and
carried
gray
gloves
on
their
cane
handles
passed
a
bewildered
old
lady
borne
along
like
a
basket
of
eggs
between
two
men
who
exclaimed
to
her
of
the
wonders
of
times
square
explained
them
so
quickly
that
the
old
lady
trying
to
be
impartially
interested
waved
her
head
here
and
there
like
a
piece
of
old
anthony
heard
a
snatch
of
their
conversation
there
the
astor
mama
look
see
the
chariot
race
sign
there
where
we
were
no
good
gracious
you
should
worry
and
grow
thin
like
a
dime
he
recognized
the
current
witticism
of
the
year
as
it
issued
stridently
from
one
of
the
pairs
at
his
elbow
and
i
says
to
him
i
says
the
soft
rush
of
taxis
by
him
and
laughter
laughter
hoarse
as
a
crow
incessant
and
loud
with
the
rumble
of
the
subways
underneath
and
over
all
the
revolutions
of
light
the
growings
and
recedings
of
light
light
dividing
like
pearls
forming
and
reforming
in
glittering
bars
and
circles
and
monstrous
grotesque
figures
cut
amazingly
on
the
sky
he
turned
thankfully
down
the
hush
that
blew
like
a
dark
wind
out
of
a
passed
a
in
whose
windows
a
dozen
roast
chickens
turned
over
and
over
on
an
automatic
spit
from
the
door
came
a
smell
that
was
hot
doughy
and
pink
a
next
exhaling
medicines
spilt
soda
water
and
a
pleasant
undertone
from
the
cosmetic
counter
then
a
chinese
laundry
still
open
steamy
and
stifling
smelling
folded
and
vaguely
yellow
all
these
depressed
him
reaching
sixth
avenue
he
stopped
at
a
corner
cigar
store
and
emerged
feeling
better
the
cigar
store
was
cheerful
humanity
in
a
navy
blue
mist
buying
a
luxury
once
in
his
apartment
he
smoked
a
last
cigarette
sitting
in
the
dark
by
his
open
front
window
for
the
first
time
in
over
a
year
he
found
himself
thoroughly
enjoying
new
york
there
was
a
rare
pungency
in
it
certainly
a
quality
almost
southern
a
lonesome
town
though
he
who
had
grown
up
alone
had
lately
learned
to
avoid
solitude
during
the
past
several
months
he
had
been
careful
when
he
had
no
engagement
for
the
evening
to
hurry
to
one
of
his
clubs
and
find
some
one
oh
there
was
a
loneliness
here
his
cigarette
its
smoke
bordering
the
thin
folds
of
curtain
with
rims
of
faint
white
spray
glowed
on
until
the
clock
in
anne
down
the
street
struck
one
with
a
querulous
fashionable
beauty
the
elevated
half
a
quiet
block
away
sounded
a
rumble
of
drums
and
should
he
lean
from
his
window
he
would
see
the
train
like
an
angry
eagle
breasting
the
dark
curve
at
the
corner
he
was
reminded
of
a
fantastic
romance
he
had
lately
read
in
which
cities
had
been
bombed
from
aerial
trains
and
for
a
moment
he
fancied
that
washington
square
had
declared
war
on
central
park
and
that
this
was
a
menace
loaded
with
battle
and
sudden
death
but
as
it
passed
the
illusion
faded
it
diminished
to
the
faintest
of
drums
then
to
a
droning
eagle
there
were
the
bells
and
the
continued
low
blur
of
auto
horns
from
fifth
avenue
but
his
own
street
was
silent
and
he
was
safe
in
here
from
all
the
threat
of
life
for
there
was
his
door
and
the
long
hall
and
his
guardian
bedroom
safe
safe
the
shining
into
his
window
seemed
for
this
hour
like
the
moon
only
brighter
and
more
beautiful
than
the
moon
a
in
paradise
who
was
born
anew
every
hundred
years
sat
in
a
sort
of
outdoor
waiting
room
through
which
blew
gusts
of
white
wind
and
occasionally
a
breathless
hurried
star
the
stars
winked
at
her
intimately
as
they
went
by
and
the
winds
made
a
soft
incessant
flurry
in
her
hair
she
was
incomprehensible
for
in
her
soul
and
spirit
were
one
the
beauty
of
her
body
was
the
essence
of
her
soul
she
was
that
unity
sought
for
by
philosophers
through
many
centuries
in
this
outdoor
waiting
room
of
winds
and
stars
she
had
been
sitting
for
a
hundred
years
at
peace
in
the
contemplation
of
became
known
to
her
at
length
that
she
was
to
be
born
again
sighing
she
began
a
long
conversation
with
a
voice
that
was
in
the
white
wind
a
conversation
that
took
many
hours
and
of
which
i
can
give
only
a
fragment
beauty
lips
scarcely
stirring
her
eyes
turned
as
always
inward
upon
whither
shall
i
journey
now
the
voice
to
a
new
country
a
land
you
have
never
seen
before
beauty
i
loathe
breaking
into
these
new
civilizations
how
long
a
stay
this
time
the
voice
fifteen
years
beauty
and
what
the
name
of
the
place
the
voice
it
is
the
most
opulent
most
gorgeous
land
on
earth
a
land
whose
wisest
are
but
little
wiser
than
its
dullest
a
land
where
the
rulers
have
minds
like
little
children
and
the
believe
in
santa
claus
where
ugly
women
control
strong
men
beauty
what
the
voice
much
yes
it
is
truly
a
melancholy
spectacle
women
with
receding
chins
and
shapeless
noses
go
about
in
broad
daylight
saying
do
this
and
do
that
and
all
the
men
even
those
of
great
wealth
obey
implicitly
their
women
to
whom
they
refer
sonorously
either
as
or
as
the
wife
beauty
but
this
ca
be
true
i
can
understand
of
course
their
obedience
to
women
of
charm
but
to
fat
women
to
bony
women
to
women
with
scrawny
cheeks
the
voice
even
so
beauty
what
of
me
what
chance
shall
i
have
the
voice
it
will
be
harder
going
if
i
may
borrow
a
phrase
beauty
a
dissatisfied
why
not
the
old
lands
the
land
of
grapes
and
men
or
the
land
of
ships
and
seas
the
voice
it
expected
that
they
be
very
busy
shortly
beauty
oh
the
voice
your
life
on
earth
will
be
as
always
the
interval
between
two
significant
glances
in
a
mundane
mirror
beauty
what
will
i
be
tell
me
the
voice
at
first
it
was
thought
that
you
would
go
this
time
as
an
actress
in
the
motion
pictures
but
after
all
it
not
advisable
you
will
be
disguised
during
your
fifteen
years
as
what
is
called
a
susciety
gurl
beauty
what
that
is
a
new
sound
in
the
wind
which
must
for
our
purposes
be
interpreted
the
voice
its
the
voice
it
a
sort
of
bogus
aristocrat
beauty
bogus
what
is
bogus
the
voice
that
too
you
will
discover
in
this
land
you
will
find
much
that
is
bogus
also
you
will
do
much
that
is
bogus
beauty
it
all
sounds
so
vulgar
the
voice
not
half
as
vulgar
as
it
is
you
will
be
known
during
your
fifteen
years
as
a
ragtime
kid
a
flapper
a
and
a
baby
vamp
you
will
dance
new
dances
neither
more
nor
less
gracefully
than
you
danced
the
old
ones
beauty
a
will
i
be
paid
the
voice
yes
as
usual
in
love
beauty
a
faint
laugh
which
disturbs
only
momentarily
the
immobility
of
her
and
will
i
like
being
called
a
the
voice
you
will
love
it
dialogue
ends
here
beauty
sitting
quietly
the
stars
pausing
in
an
ecstasy
of
appreciation
the
wind
white
and
gusty
blowing
through
her
this
took
place
seven
years
anthony
by
the
front
windows
of
his
apartment
and
listened
to
the
chimes
of
st
chapter
ii
portrait
of
a
siren
crispness
folded
down
upon
new
york
a
month
later
bringing
november
and
the
three
big
football
games
and
a
great
fluttering
of
furs
along
fifth
avenue
it
brought
also
a
sense
of
tension
to
the
city
and
suppressed
excitement
every
morning
now
there
were
invitations
in
anthony
mail
three
dozen
virtuous
females
of
the
first
layer
were
proclaiming
their
fitness
if
not
their
specific
willingness
to
bear
children
unto
three
dozen
millionaires
five
dozen
virtuous
females
of
the
second
layer
were
proclaiming
not
only
this
fitness
but
in
addition
a
tremendous
undaunted
ambition
toward
the
first
three
dozen
young
men
who
were
of
course
invited
to
each
of
the
parties
as
were
the
young
lady
group
of
family
friends
acquaintances
college
boys
and
eager
young
outsiders
to
continue
there
was
a
third
layer
from
the
skirts
of
the
city
from
newark
and
the
jersey
suburbs
up
to
bitter
connecticut
and
the
ineligible
sections
of
long
island
and
doubtless
contiguous
layers
down
to
the
city
shoes
jewesses
were
coming
out
into
a
society
of
jewish
men
and
women
from
riverside
to
the
bronx
and
looking
forward
to
a
rising
young
broker
or
jeweller
and
a
kosher
wedding
irish
girls
were
casting
their
eyes
with
license
at
last
to
do
so
upon
a
society
of
young
tammany
politicians
pious
undertakers
and
choirboys
and
naturally
the
city
caught
the
contagious
air
of
entré
the
working
girls
poor
ugly
souls
wrapping
soap
in
the
factories
and
showing
finery
in
the
big
stores
dreamed
that
perhaps
in
the
spectacular
excitement
of
this
winter
they
might
obtain
for
themselves
the
coveted
male
as
in
a
muddled
carnival
crowd
an
inefficient
pickpocket
may
consider
his
chances
increased
and
the
chimneys
commenced
to
smoke
and
the
subway
foulness
was
freshened
and
the
actresses
came
out
in
new
plays
and
the
publishers
came
out
with
new
books
and
the
castles
came
out
with
new
dances
and
the
railroads
came
out
with
new
schedules
containing
new
mistakes
instead
of
the
old
ones
that
the
commuters
had
grown
used
to
the
city
was
coming
out
anthony
walking
along
street
one
afternoon
under
a
sky
ran
unexpectedly
into
richard
caramel
emerging
from
the
manhattan
hotel
barber
shop
it
was
a
cold
day
the
first
definitely
cold
day
and
caramel
had
on
one
of
those
coats
long
worn
by
the
working
men
of
the
middle
west
that
were
just
coming
into
fashionable
approval
his
soft
hat
was
of
a
discreet
dark
brown
and
from
under
it
his
clear
eye
flamed
like
a
topaz
he
stopped
anthony
enthusiastically
slapping
him
on
the
arms
more
from
a
desire
to
keep
himself
warm
than
from
playfulness
and
after
his
inevitable
hand
shake
exploded
into
sound
cold
as
the
devil
good
lord
i
been
working
like
the
deuce
all
day
till
my
room
got
so
cold
i
thought
i
get
pneumonia
darn
landlady
economizing
on
coal
came
up
when
i
yelled
over
the
stairs
for
her
for
half
an
hour
began
explaining
why
and
all
god
first
she
drove
me
crazy
then
i
began
to
think
she
was
sort
of
a
character
and
took
notes
while
she
talked
so
she
could
see
me
you
know
just
as
though
i
were
writing
casually
he
had
seized
anthony
arm
and
walking
him
briskly
up
madison
avenue
where
to
nowhere
in
particular
well
then
what
the
use
demanded
anthony
they
stopped
and
stared
at
each
other
and
anthony
wondered
if
the
cold
made
his
own
face
as
repellent
as
dick
caramel
whose
nose
was
crimson
whose
bulging
brow
was
blue
whose
yellow
unmatched
eyes
were
red
and
watery
at
the
rims
after
a
moment
they
began
walking
again
done
some
good
work
on
my
novel
dick
was
looking
and
talking
emphatically
at
the
sidewalk
but
i
have
to
get
out
once
in
a
while
he
glanced
at
anthony
apologetically
as
though
craving
encouragement
i
have
to
talk
i
guess
very
few
people
ever
really
i
mean
sit
down
and
ponder
and
have
ideas
in
sequence
i
do
my
thinking
in
writing
or
conversation
you
got
to
have
a
start
sort
of
something
to
defend
or
contradict
do
you
think
anthony
grunted
and
withdrew
his
arm
gently
i
do
mind
carrying
you
dick
but
with
that
coat
i
mean
continued
richard
caramel
gravely
that
on
paper
your
first
paragraph
contains
the
idea
you
going
to
damn
or
enlarge
on
in
conversation
you
got
your
last
statement
but
when
you
simply
why
your
ideas
just
succeed
each
other
like
pictures
and
each
one
forces
out
the
last
they
passed
street
and
slowed
down
slightly
both
of
them
lit
cigarettes
and
blew
tremendous
clouds
of
smoke
and
frosted
breath
into
the
air
let
walk
up
to
the
plaza
and
have
an
suggested
anthony
do
you
good
air
get
the
rotten
nicotine
out
of
your
lungs
come
on
i
let
you
talk
about
your
book
all
the
way
i
do
want
to
if
it
bores
you
i
mean
you
need
do
it
as
a
favor
the
words
tumbled
out
in
haste
and
though
he
tried
to
keep
his
face
casual
it
screwed
up
uncertainly
anthony
was
compelled
to
protest
bore
me
i
should
say
not
got
a
cousin
began
dick
but
anthony
interrupted
by
stretching
out
his
arms
and
breathing
forth
a
low
cry
of
exultation
good
weather
he
exclaimed
is
it
makes
me
feel
about
ten
i
mean
it
makes
me
feel
as
i
should
have
felt
when
i
was
ten
murderous
oh
god
one
minute
it
my
world
and
the
next
i
the
world
fool
it
my
world
and
everything
easy
easy
even
nothing
is
easy
got
a
cousin
up
at
the
plaza
famous
girl
we
can
go
up
and
meet
her
she
lives
there
in
the
winter
has
lately
anyway
with
her
mother
and
father
did
know
you
had
cousins
in
new
york
her
name
gloria
she
from
home
kansas
city
her
mother
a
practising
bilphist
and
her
father
quite
dull
but
a
perfect
gentleman
what
are
they
literary
material
they
try
to
be
all
the
old
man
does
is
tell
me
he
just
met
the
most
wonderful
character
for
a
novel
then
he
tells
me
about
some
idiotic
friend
of
his
and
then
he
says
a
character
for
you
why
do
you
write
him
up
everybody
be
interested
in
or
else
he
tells
me
about
japan
or
paris
or
some
other
very
obvious
place
and
says
do
you
write
a
story
about
that
place
that
be
a
wonderful
setting
for
a
story
how
about
the
girl
inquired
anthony
casually
gloria
gloria
what
gilbert
oh
you
heard
of
her
gloria
gilbert
goes
to
dances
at
colleges
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
heard
her
name
in
fact
damned
attractive
they
reached
fiftieth
street
and
turned
over
toward
the
avenue
i
do
care
for
young
girls
as
a
rule
said
anthony
frowning
this
was
not
strictly
true
while
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
average
debutante
spent
every
hour
of
her
day
thinking
and
talking
about
what
the
great
world
had
mapped
out
for
her
to
do
during
the
next
hour
any
girl
who
made
a
living
directly
on
her
prettiness
interested
him
enormously
gloria
darn
nice
not
a
brain
in
her
head
anthony
laughed
in
a
snort
by
that
you
mean
that
she
has
a
line
of
literary
patter
no
i
do
dick
you
know
what
passes
as
brains
in
a
girl
for
you
earnest
young
women
who
sit
with
you
in
a
corner
and
talk
earnestly
about
life
the
kind
who
when
they
were
sixteen
argued
with
grave
faces
as
to
whether
kissing
was
right
or
wrong
and
whether
it
was
immoral
for
freshmen
to
drink
beer
richard
caramel
was
offended
his
scowl
crinkled
like
crushed
paper
no
he
began
but
anthony
interrupted
ruthlessly
oh
yes
kind
who
just
at
present
sit
in
corners
and
confer
on
the
latest
scandinavian
dante
available
in
english
translation
dick
turned
to
him
a
curious
falling
in
his
whole
countenance
his
question
was
almost
an
appeal
what
the
matter
with
you
and
maury
you
talk
sometimes
as
though
i
were
a
sort
of
inferior
anthony
was
confused
but
he
was
also
cold
and
a
little
uncomfortable
so
he
took
refuge
in
attack
i
do
think
your
brains
matter
dick
of
course
they
matter
exclaimed
dick
angrily
what
do
you
mean
why
do
they
matter
you
might
know
too
much
for
your
pen
i
could
possibly
i
can
imagine
insisted
anthony
a
man
knowing
too
much
for
his
talent
to
express
like
me
suppose
for
instance
i
have
more
wisdom
than
you
and
less
talent
it
would
tend
to
make
me
inarticulate
you
on
the
contrary
have
enough
water
to
fill
the
pail
and
a
big
enough
pail
to
hold
the
water
i
do
follow
you
at
all
complained
dick
in
a
crestfallen
tone
infinitely
dismayed
he
seemed
to
bulge
in
protest
he
was
staring
intently
at
anthony
and
caroming
off
a
succession
of
who
reproached
him
with
fierce
resentful
glances
i
simply
mean
that
a
talent
like
wells
could
carry
the
intelligence
of
a
spencer
but
an
inferior
talent
can
only
be
graceful
when
carrying
inferior
ideas
and
the
more
narrowly
you
can
look
at
a
thing
the
more
entertaining
you
can
be
about
it
dick
considered
unable
to
decide
the
exact
degree
of
criticism
intended
by
anthony
remarks
but
anthony
with
that
facility
which
seemed
so
frequently
to
flow
from
him
continued
his
dark
eyes
gleaming
in
his
thin
face
his
chin
raised
his
voice
raised
his
whole
physical
being
raised
say
i
am
proud
and
sane
and
wise
an
athenian
among
greeks
well
i
might
fail
where
a
lesser
man
would
succeed
he
could
imitate
he
could
adorn
he
could
be
enthusiastic
he
could
be
hopefully
constructive
but
this
hypothetical
me
would
be
too
proud
to
imitate
too
sane
to
be
enthusiastic
too
sophisticated
to
be
utopian
too
grecian
to
adorn
then
you
do
think
the
artist
works
from
his
intelligence
no
he
goes
on
improving
if
he
can
what
he
imitates
in
the
way
of
style
and
choosing
from
his
own
interpretation
of
the
things
around
him
what
constitutes
material
but
after
all
every
writer
writes
because
it
his
mode
of
living
do
tell
me
you
like
this
function
of
the
artist
business
i
not
accustomed
even
to
refer
to
myself
as
an
artist
dick
said
anthony
changing
his
tone
i
want
to
beg
your
pardon
why
for
that
outburst
i
honestly
sorry
i
was
talking
for
effect
somewhat
mollified
dick
rejoined
i
often
said
you
were
a
philistine
at
heart
it
was
a
crackling
dusk
when
they
turned
in
under
the
white
façade
of
the
plaza
and
tasted
slowly
the
foam
and
yellow
thickness
of
an
anthony
looked
at
his
companion
richard
caramel
nose
and
brow
were
slowly
approaching
a
like
pigmentation
the
red
was
leaving
the
one
the
blue
deserting
the
other
glancing
in
a
mirror
anthony
was
glad
to
find
that
his
own
skin
had
not
discolored
on
the
contrary
a
faint
glow
had
kindled
in
his
cheeks
he
fancied
that
he
had
never
looked
so
well
enough
for
me
said
dick
his
tone
that
of
an
athlete
in
training
i
want
to
go
up
and
see
the
gilberts
wo
you
come
why
yes
if
you
do
dedicate
me
to
the
parents
and
dash
off
in
the
corner
with
dora
not
dora
gloria
a
clerk
announced
them
over
the
phone
and
ascending
to
the
tenth
floor
they
followed
a
winding
corridor
and
knocked
at
the
door
was
answered
by
a
lady
gilbert
herself
how
do
you
do
she
spoke
in
the
conventional
american
language
well
i
glad
to
see
you
hasty
interjections
by
dick
and
then
pats
well
do
come
in
and
leave
your
coat
there
she
pointed
to
a
chair
and
changed
her
inflection
to
a
deprecatory
laugh
full
of
minute
gasps
this
is
really
lovely
lovely
why
richard
you
have
been
here
for
long
no
no
the
latter
monosyllables
served
half
as
responses
half
as
periods
to
some
vague
starts
from
dick
well
do
sit
down
and
tell
me
what
you
been
doing
one
crossed
and
recrossed
one
stood
and
bowed
ever
so
gently
one
smiled
again
and
again
with
helpless
stupidity
one
wondered
if
she
would
ever
sit
down
at
length
one
slid
thankfully
into
a
chair
and
settled
for
a
pleasant
call
i
suppose
it
because
you
been
busy
as
much
as
anything
else
smiled
gilbert
somewhat
ambiguously
the
as
much
as
anything
else
she
used
to
balance
all
her
more
rickety
sentences
she
had
two
other
ones
at
least
that
the
way
i
look
at
it
and
pure
and
simple
these
three
alternated
gave
each
of
her
remarks
an
air
of
being
a
general
reflection
on
life
as
though
she
had
calculated
all
causes
and
at
length
put
her
finger
on
the
ultimate
one
richard
caramel
face
anthony
saw
was
now
quite
normal
the
brow
and
cheeks
were
of
a
flesh
color
the
nose
politely
inconspicuous
he
had
fixed
his
aunt
with
the
eye
giving
her
that
acute
and
exaggerated
attention
that
young
males
are
accustomed
to
render
to
all
females
who
are
of
no
further
value
are
you
a
writer
too
pats
well
perhaps
we
can
all
bask
in
richard
fame
gentle
laughter
led
by
gilbert
gloria
out
she
said
with
an
air
of
laying
down
an
axiom
from
which
she
would
proceed
to
derive
results
she
dancing
somewhere
gloria
goes
goes
goes
i
tell
her
i
do
see
how
she
stands
it
she
dances
all
afternoon
and
all
night
until
i
think
she
going
to
wear
herself
to
a
shadow
her
father
is
very
worried
about
her
she
smiled
from
one
to
the
other
they
both
smiled
she
was
composed
anthony
perceived
of
a
succession
of
semicircles
and
parabolas
like
those
figures
that
gifted
folk
make
on
the
typewriter
head
arms
bust
hips
thighs
and
ankles
were
in
a
bewildering
tier
of
roundnesses
well
ordered
and
clean
she
was
with
hair
of
an
artificially
rich
gray
her
large
face
sheltered
blue
eyes
and
was
adorned
with
just
the
faintest
white
mustache
i
always
say
she
remarked
to
anthony
that
richard
is
an
ancient
soul
in
the
tense
pause
that
followed
anthony
considered
a
pun
something
about
dick
having
been
much
walked
upon
we
all
have
souls
of
different
ages
continued
gilbert
radiantly
at
least
that
what
i
say
perhaps
so
agreed
anthony
with
an
air
of
quickening
to
a
hopeful
idea
the
voice
bubbled
on
gloria
has
a
very
young
soul
irresponsible
as
much
as
anything
else
she
has
no
sense
of
responsibility
she
sparkling
aunt
catherine
said
richard
pleasantly
a
sense
of
responsibility
would
spoil
her
she
too
pretty
well
confessed
gilbert
all
i
know
is
that
she
goes
and
goes
and
goes
the
number
of
goings
to
gloria
discredit
was
lost
in
the
rattle
of
the
as
it
turned
to
admit
gilbert
he
was
a
short
man
with
a
mustache
resting
like
a
small
white
cloud
beneath
his
undistinguished
nose
he
had
reached
the
stage
where
his
value
as
a
social
creature
was
a
black
and
imponderable
negative
his
ideas
were
the
popular
delusions
of
twenty
years
before
his
mind
steered
a
wabbly
and
anaemic
course
in
the
wake
of
the
daily
newspaper
editorials
after
graduating
from
a
small
but
terrifying
western
university
he
had
entered
the
celluloid
business
and
as
this
required
only
the
minute
measure
of
intelligence
he
brought
to
it
he
did
well
for
several
years
in
fact
until
about
when
he
began
exchanging
contracts
for
vague
agreements
with
the
moving
picture
industry
the
moving
picture
industry
had
decided
about
to
gobble
him
up
and
at
this
time
he
was
so
to
speak
delicately
balanced
on
its
tongue
meanwhile
he
was
supervising
manager
of
the
associated
film
materials
company
spending
six
months
of
each
year
in
new
york
and
the
remainder
in
kansas
city
and
louis
he
felt
credulously
that
there
was
a
good
thing
coming
to
him
and
his
wife
thought
so
and
his
daughter
thought
so
too
he
disapproved
of
gloria
she
stayed
out
late
she
never
ate
her
meals
she
was
always
in
a
he
had
irritated
her
once
and
she
had
used
toward
him
words
that
he
had
not
thought
were
part
of
her
vocabulary
his
wife
was
easier
after
fifteen
years
of
incessant
guerilla
warfare
he
had
conquered
her
it
was
a
war
of
muddled
optimism
against
organized
dulness
and
something
in
the
number
of
yes
with
which
he
could
poison
a
conversation
had
won
him
the
victory
he
would
say
let
me
see
that
was
the
summer
of
let
me
see
or
fifteen
years
of
yes
had
beaten
gilbert
fifteen
further
years
of
that
incessant
unaffirmative
affirmative
accompanied
by
the
perpetual
flicking
of
from
thousand
cigars
had
broken
her
to
this
husband
of
hers
she
made
the
last
concession
of
married
life
which
is
more
complete
more
irrevocable
than
the
first
she
listened
to
him
she
told
herself
that
the
years
had
brought
her
tolerance
actually
they
had
slain
what
measure
she
had
ever
possessed
of
moral
courage
she
introduced
him
to
anthony
this
is
pats
she
said
the
young
man
and
the
old
touched
flesh
gilbert
hand
was
soft
worn
away
to
the
pulpy
semblance
of
a
squeezed
grapefruit
then
husband
and
wife
exchanged
greetings
he
told
her
it
had
grown
colder
out
he
said
he
had
walked
down
to
a
on
street
for
a
kansas
city
paper
he
had
intended
to
ride
back
in
the
bus
but
he
had
found
it
too
cold
yes
yes
yes
yes
too
cold
gilbert
added
flavor
to
his
adventure
by
being
impressed
with
his
courage
in
braving
the
harsh
air
well
you
spunky
she
exclaimed
admiringly
you
spunky
i
would
have
gone
out
for
anything
gilbert
with
true
masculine
impassivity
disregarded
the
awe
he
had
excited
in
his
wife
he
turned
to
the
two
young
men
and
triumphantly
routed
them
on
the
subject
of
the
weather
richard
caramel
was
called
on
to
remember
the
month
of
november
in
kansas
no
sooner
had
the
theme
been
pushed
toward
him
however
than
it
was
violently
fished
back
to
be
lingered
over
pawed
over
elongated
and
generally
devitalized
by
its
sponsor
the
immemorial
thesis
that
the
days
somewhere
were
warm
but
the
nights
very
pleasant
was
successfully
propounded
and
they
decided
the
exact
distance
on
an
obscure
railroad
between
two
points
that
dick
had
inadvertently
mentioned
anthony
fixed
gilbert
with
a
steady
stare
and
went
into
a
trance
through
which
after
a
moment
smiling
voice
penetrated
it
seems
as
though
the
cold
were
damper
here
it
seems
to
eat
into
my
bones
as
this
remark
adequately
yessed
had
been
on
the
tip
of
tongue
he
could
not
be
blamed
for
rather
abruptly
changing
the
subject
where
gloria
she
ought
to
be
here
any
minute
have
you
met
my
daughter
have
had
the
pleasure
i
heard
dick
speak
of
her
often
she
and
richard
are
cousins
yes
anthony
smiled
with
some
effort
he
was
not
used
to
the
society
of
his
seniors
and
his
mouth
was
stiff
from
superfluous
cheerfulness
it
was
such
a
pleasant
thought
about
gloria
and
dick
being
cousins
he
managed
within
the
next
minute
to
throw
an
agonized
glance
at
his
friend
richard
caramel
was
afraid
they
have
to
toddle
off
gilbert
was
tremendously
sorry
gilbert
thought
it
was
too
bad
gilbert
had
a
further
idea
something
about
being
glad
they
come
anyhow
even
if
they
only
seen
an
old
lady
too
old
to
flirt
with
them
anthony
and
dick
evidently
considered
this
a
sly
sally
for
they
laughed
one
bar
in
time
would
they
come
again
soon
oh
yes
gloria
would
be
sorry
smiles
smiles
bang
two
disconsolate
young
men
walking
down
the
corridor
of
the
plaza
in
the
direction
of
the
elevator
a
lady
legs
behind
maury
noble
attractive
indolence
his
irrelevance
and
his
easy
mockery
lay
a
surprising
and
relentless
maturity
of
purpose
his
intention
as
he
stated
it
in
college
had
been
to
use
three
years
in
travel
three
years
in
utter
leisure
and
then
to
become
immensely
rich
as
quickly
as
possible
his
three
years
of
travel
were
over
he
had
accomplished
the
globe
with
an
intensity
and
curiosity
that
in
any
one
else
would
have
seemed
pedantic
without
redeeming
spontaneity
almost
the
of
a
human
baedeker
but
in
this
case
it
assumed
an
air
of
mysterious
purpose
and
significant
design
as
though
maury
noble
were
some
predestined
urged
by
a
preordination
to
go
everywhere
there
was
to
go
along
the
earth
and
to
see
all
the
billions
of
humans
who
bred
and
wept
and
slew
each
other
here
and
there
upon
it
back
in
america
he
was
sallying
into
the
search
for
amusement
with
the
same
consistent
absorption
he
who
had
never
taken
more
than
a
few
cocktails
or
a
pint
of
wine
at
a
sitting
taught
himself
to
drink
as
he
would
have
taught
himself
greek
like
greek
it
would
be
the
gateway
to
a
wealth
of
new
sensations
new
psychic
states
new
reactions
in
joy
or
misery
his
habits
were
a
matter
for
esoteric
speculation
he
had
three
rooms
in
a
bachelor
apartment
on
street
but
he
was
seldom
to
be
found
there
the
telephone
girl
had
received
the
most
positive
instructions
that
no
one
should
even
have
his
ear
without
first
giving
a
name
to
be
passed
upon
she
had
a
list
of
half
a
dozen
people
to
whom
he
was
never
at
home
and
of
the
same
number
to
whom
he
was
always
at
home
foremost
on
the
latter
list
were
anthony
patch
and
richard
caramel
maury
mother
lived
with
her
married
son
in
philadelphia
and
there
maury
went
usually
for
the
so
one
saturday
night
when
anthony
prowling
the
chilly
streets
in
a
fit
of
utter
boredom
dropped
in
at
the
molton
arms
he
was
overjoyed
to
find
that
noble
was
at
home
his
spirits
soared
faster
than
the
flying
elevator
this
was
so
good
so
extremely
good
to
be
about
to
talk
to
maury
who
would
be
equally
happy
at
seeing
him
they
would
look
at
each
other
with
a
deep
affection
just
behind
their
eyes
which
both
would
conceal
beneath
some
attenuated
raillery
had
it
been
summer
they
would
have
gone
out
together
and
indolently
sipped
two
long
tom
collinses
as
they
wilted
their
collars
and
watched
the
faintly
diverting
round
of
some
lazy
august
cabaret
but
it
was
cold
outside
with
wind
around
the
edges
of
the
tall
buildings
and
december
just
up
the
street
so
better
far
an
evening
together
under
the
soft
lamplight
and
a
drink
or
two
of
bushmill
or
a
thimbleful
of
maury
grand
marnier
with
the
books
gleaming
like
ornaments
against
the
walls
and
maury
radiating
a
divine
inertia
as
he
rested
large
and
catlike
in
his
favorite
chair
there
he
was
the
room
closed
about
anthony
warmed
him
the
glow
of
that
strong
persuasive
mind
that
temperament
almost
oriental
in
its
outward
impassivity
warmed
anthony
restless
soul
and
brought
him
a
peace
that
could
be
likened
only
to
the
peace
a
stupid
woman
gives
one
must
understand
all
else
one
must
take
all
for
granted
maury
filled
the
room
tigerlike
godlike
the
winds
outside
were
stilled
the
brass
candlesticks
on
the
mantel
glowed
like
tapers
before
an
altar
what
keeps
you
here
anthony
spread
himself
over
a
yielding
sofa
and
made
an
among
the
pillows
just
been
here
an
hour
tea
dance
and
i
stayed
so
late
i
missed
my
train
to
philadelphia
strange
to
stay
so
long
commented
anthony
curiously
rather
what
you
do
geraldine
little
usher
at
keith
i
told
you
about
her
oh
paid
me
a
call
about
three
and
stayed
till
five
peculiar
little
soul
she
gets
me
she
so
utterly
stupid
maury
was
silent
strange
as
it
may
seem
continued
anthony
so
far
as
i
concerned
and
even
so
far
as
i
know
geraldine
is
a
paragon
of
virtue
he
had
known
her
a
month
a
girl
of
nondescript
and
nomadic
habits
someone
had
casually
passed
her
on
to
anthony
who
considered
her
amusing
and
rather
liked
the
chaste
and
fairylike
kisses
she
had
given
him
on
the
third
night
of
their
acquaintance
when
they
had
driven
in
a
taxi
through
the
park
she
had
a
vague
family
a
shadowy
aunt
and
uncle
who
shared
with
her
an
apartment
in
the
labyrinthine
hundreds
she
was
company
familiar
and
faintly
intimate
and
restful
further
than
that
he
did
not
care
to
experiment
not
from
any
moral
compunction
but
from
a
dread
of
allowing
any
entanglement
to
disturb
what
he
felt
was
the
growing
serenity
of
his
life
she
has
two
stunts
he
informed
maury
one
of
them
is
to
get
her
hair
over
her
eyes
some
way
and
then
blow
it
out
and
the
other
is
to
say
when
some
one
makes
a
remark
that
over
her
head
it
fascinates
me
i
sit
there
hour
after
hour
completely
intrigued
by
the
maniacal
symptoms
she
finds
in
my
imagination
maury
stirred
in
his
chair
and
spoke
remarkable
that
a
person
can
comprehend
so
little
and
yet
live
in
such
a
complex
civilization
a
woman
like
that
actually
takes
the
whole
universe
in
the
most
way
from
the
influence
of
rousseau
to
the
bearing
of
the
tariff
rates
on
her
dinner
the
whole
phenomenon
is
utterly
strange
to
her
she
just
been
carried
along
from
an
age
of
spearheads
and
plunked
down
here
with
the
equipment
of
an
archer
for
going
into
a
pistol
duel
you
could
sweep
away
the
entire
crust
of
history
and
she
never
know
the
difference
i
wish
our
richard
would
write
about
her
anthony
surely
you
do
think
she
worth
writing
about
as
much
as
anybody
he
answered
yawning
you
know
i
was
thinking
that
i
have
a
great
confidence
in
dick
so
long
as
he
sticks
to
people
and
not
to
ideas
and
as
long
as
his
inspirations
come
from
life
and
not
from
art
and
always
granting
a
normal
growth
i
believe
be
a
big
man
i
should
think
the
appearance
of
the
black
would
prove
that
he
going
to
life
anthony
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
answered
eagerly
he
tries
to
go
to
life
so
does
every
author
except
the
very
worst
but
after
all
most
of
them
live
on
predigested
food
the
incident
or
character
may
be
from
life
but
the
writer
usually
interprets
it
in
terms
of
the
last
book
he
read
for
instance
suppose
he
meets
a
sea
captain
and
thinks
he
an
original
character
the
truth
is
that
he
sees
the
resemblance
between
the
sea
captain
and
the
last
sea
captain
dana
created
or
creates
sea
captains
and
therefore
he
knows
how
to
set
this
sea
captain
on
paper
dick
of
course
can
set
down
any
consciously
picturesque
character
but
could
he
accurately
transcribe
his
own
sister
then
they
were
off
for
half
an
hour
on
literature
a
classic
suggested
anthony
is
a
successful
book
that
has
survived
the
reaction
of
the
next
period
or
generation
then
it
safe
like
a
style
in
architecture
or
furniture
it
acquired
a
picturesque
dignity
to
take
the
place
of
its
fashion
after
a
time
the
subject
temporarily
lost
its
tang
the
interest
of
the
two
young
men
was
not
particularly
technical
they
were
in
love
with
generalities
anthony
had
recently
discovered
samuel
butler
and
the
brisk
aphorisms
in
the
seemed
to
him
the
quintessence
of
criticism
maury
his
whole
mind
so
thoroughly
mellowed
by
the
very
hardness
of
his
scheme
of
life
seemed
inevitably
the
wiser
of
the
two
yet
in
the
actual
stuff
of
their
intelligences
they
were
not
it
seemed
fundamentally
different
they
drifted
from
letters
to
the
curiosities
of
each
other
day
whose
tea
was
it
people
named
abercrombie
why
you
stay
late
meet
a
luscious
débutante
yes
did
you
really
anthony
voice
lifted
in
surprise
not
a
débutante
exactly
said
she
came
out
two
winters
ago
in
kansas
city
sort
of
no
answered
maury
with
some
amusement
i
think
that
the
last
thing
i
say
about
her
she
seemed
well
somehow
the
youngest
person
there
not
too
young
to
make
you
miss
a
train
young
enough
beautiful
child
anthony
chuckled
in
his
snort
oh
maury
you
in
your
second
childhood
what
do
you
mean
by
beautiful
maury
gazed
helplessly
into
space
well
i
ca
describe
her
exactly
except
to
say
that
she
was
beautiful
she
was
tremendously
alive
she
was
eating
what
it
was
a
sort
of
attenuated
vice
she
a
nervous
kind
said
she
always
ate
at
teas
because
she
had
to
stand
around
so
long
in
one
place
what
you
talk
about
bergson
bilphism
whether
the
is
immoral
maury
was
unruffled
his
fur
seemed
to
run
all
ways
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
did
talk
on
bilphism
seems
her
mother
a
bilphist
mostly
though
we
talked
about
legs
anthony
rocked
in
glee
my
god
whose
legs
hers
she
talked
a
lot
about
hers
as
though
they
were
a
sort
of
choice
she
aroused
a
great
desire
to
see
them
what
is
she
a
dancer
no
i
found
she
was
a
cousin
of
dick
anthony
sat
upright
so
suddenly
that
the
pillow
he
released
stood
on
end
like
a
live
thing
and
dove
to
the
floor
name
gloria
gilbert
he
cried
yes
is
she
remarkable
i
sure
i
do
know
but
for
sheer
dulness
her
father
well
interrupted
maury
with
implacable
conviction
her
family
may
be
as
sad
as
professional
mourners
but
i
inclined
to
think
that
she
a
quite
authentic
and
original
character
the
outer
signs
of
the
yale
prom
girl
and
all
that
but
different
very
emphatically
different
go
on
go
on
urged
anthony
soon
as
dick
told
me
she
did
have
a
brain
in
her
head
i
knew
she
must
be
pretty
good
did
he
say
that
swore
to
it
said
anthony
with
another
snorting
laugh
well
what
he
means
by
brains
in
a
woman
is
i
know
interrupted
anthony
eagerly
he
means
a
smattering
of
literary
misinformation
that
it
the
kind
who
believes
that
the
annual
moral
of
the
country
is
a
very
good
thing
or
the
kind
who
believes
it
a
very
ominous
thing
either
or
postures
well
this
girl
talked
about
legs
she
talked
about
skin
too
her
own
skin
always
her
own
she
told
me
the
sort
of
tan
she
like
to
get
in
the
summer
and
how
closely
she
usually
approximated
it
you
sat
enraptured
by
her
low
alto
by
her
low
alto
no
by
tan
i
began
thinking
about
tan
i
began
to
think
what
color
i
turned
when
i
made
my
last
exposure
about
two
years
ago
i
did
use
to
get
a
pretty
good
tan
i
used
to
get
a
sort
of
bronze
if
i
remember
rightly
anthony
retired
into
the
cushions
shaken
with
laughter
she
got
you
going
oh
maury
maury
the
connecticut
the
human
nutmeg
extra
heiress
elopes
with
because
of
his
luscious
pigmentation
afterward
found
to
be
tasmanian
strain
in
his
family
maury
sighed
rising
he
walked
to
the
window
and
raised
the
shade
snowing
hard
anthony
still
laughing
quietly
to
himself
made
no
answer
another
winter
maury
voice
from
the
window
was
almost
a
whisper
we
growing
old
anthony
i
by
god
three
years
to
thirty
and
then
i
what
an
undergraduate
calls
a
man
anthony
was
silent
for
a
moment
you
old
maury
he
agreed
at
length
the
first
signs
of
a
very
dissolute
and
wabbly
senescence
you
have
spent
the
afternoon
talking
about
tan
and
a
lady
legs
maury
pulled
down
the
shade
with
a
sudden
harsh
snap
idiot
he
cried
that
from
you
here
i
sit
young
anthony
as
sit
for
a
generation
or
more
and
watch
such
gay
souls
as
you
and
dick
and
gloria
gilbert
go
past
me
dancing
and
singing
and
loving
and
hating
one
another
and
being
moved
being
eternally
moved
and
i
am
moved
only
by
my
lack
of
emotion
i
shall
sit
and
the
snow
will
come
oh
for
a
caramel
to
take
notes
and
another
winter
and
i
shall
be
thirty
and
you
and
dick
and
gloria
will
go
on
being
eternally
moved
and
dancing
by
me
and
singing
but
after
you
all
gone
i
be
saying
things
for
new
dicks
to
write
down
and
listening
to
the
disillusions
and
cynicisms
and
emotions
of
new
anthonys
yes
and
talking
to
new
glorias
about
the
tans
of
summers
yet
to
come
the
firelight
flurried
up
on
the
hearth
maury
left
the
window
stirred
the
blaze
with
a
poker
and
dropped
a
log
upon
the
andirons
then
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
and
the
remnants
of
his
voice
faded
in
the
new
fire
that
spit
red
and
yellow
along
the
bark
after
all
anthony
it
you
who
are
very
romantic
and
young
it
you
who
are
infinitely
more
susceptible
and
afraid
of
your
calm
being
broken
it
me
who
tries
again
and
again
to
be
moved
let
myself
go
a
thousand
times
and
i
always
me
nothing
quite
stirs
me
yet
he
murmured
after
another
long
pause
there
was
something
about
that
little
girl
with
her
absurd
tan
that
was
eternally
old
like
me
turbulence
anthony
turned
over
sleepily
in
his
bed
greeting
a
patch
of
cold
sun
on
his
counterpane
crisscrossed
with
the
shadows
of
the
leaded
window
the
room
was
full
of
morning
the
carved
chest
in
the
corner
the
ancient
and
inscrutable
wardrobe
stood
about
the
room
like
dark
symbols
of
the
obliviousness
of
matter
only
the
rug
was
beckoning
and
perishable
to
his
perishable
feet
and
bounds
horribly
inappropriate
in
his
soft
collar
was
of
stuff
as
fading
as
the
gauze
of
frozen
breath
he
uttered
he
was
close
to
the
bed
his
hand
still
lowered
where
he
had
been
jerking
at
the
upper
blanket
his
eyes
fixed
imperturbably
upon
his
master
bows
muttered
the
drowsy
god
thachew
bows
it
i
sir
anthony
moved
his
head
forced
his
eyes
wide
and
blinked
triumphantly
bounds
yes
sir
can
you
get
off
god
anthony
yawned
insufferably
and
the
contents
of
his
brain
seemed
to
fall
together
in
a
dense
hash
he
made
a
fresh
start
can
you
come
around
about
four
and
serve
some
tea
and
sandwiches
or
something
yes
sir
anthony
considered
with
chilling
lack
of
inspiration
some
sandwiches
he
repeated
helplessly
oh
some
cheese
sandwiches
and
jelly
ones
and
chicken
and
olive
i
guess
never
mind
breakfast
the
strain
of
invention
was
too
much
he
shut
his
eyes
wearily
let
his
head
roll
to
rest
inertly
and
quickly
relaxed
what
he
had
regained
of
muscular
control
out
of
a
crevice
of
his
mind
crept
the
vague
but
inevitable
spectre
of
the
night
before
but
it
proved
in
this
case
to
be
nothing
but
a
seemingly
interminable
conversation
with
richard
caramel
who
had
called
on
him
at
midnight
they
had
drunk
four
bottles
of
beer
and
munched
dry
crusts
of
bread
while
anthony
listened
to
a
reading
of
the
first
part
of
the
demon
lover
came
a
voice
now
after
many
hours
anthony
disregarded
it
as
sleep
closed
over
him
folded
down
upon
him
crept
up
into
the
byways
of
his
mind
suddenly
he
was
awake
saying
what
for
how
many
sir
it
was
still
bounds
standing
patient
and
motionless
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
bounds
who
divided
his
manner
among
three
gentlemen
how
many
what
i
think
sir
i
better
know
how
many
are
coming
i
have
to
plan
for
the
sandwiches
sir
two
muttered
anthony
huskily
lady
and
a
gentleman
bounds
said
thank
you
sir
and
moved
away
bearing
with
him
his
humiliating
reproachful
soft
collar
reproachful
to
each
of
the
three
gentlemen
who
only
demanded
of
him
a
third
after
a
long
time
anthony
arose
and
drew
an
opalescent
dressing
grown
of
brown
and
blue
over
his
slim
pleasant
figure
with
a
last
yawn
he
went
into
the
bathroom
and
turning
on
the
dresser
light
the
bathroom
had
no
outside
exposure
he
contemplated
himself
in
the
mirror
with
some
interest
a
wretched
apparition
he
thought
he
usually
thought
so
in
the
morning
sleep
made
his
face
unnaturally
pale
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
glanced
through
several
letters
and
the
morning
tribune
an
hour
later
shaven
and
dressed
he
was
sitting
at
his
desk
looking
at
a
small
piece
of
paper
he
had
taken
out
of
his
wallet
it
was
scrawled
with
memoranda
see
howland
at
five
get
see
about
rivers
bill
go
and
under
the
last
cash
in
bank
crossed
out
crossed
out
finally
down
at
the
bottom
and
in
a
hurried
scrawl
dick
and
gloria
gilbert
for
tea
this
last
item
brought
him
obvious
satisfaction
his
day
usually
a
creature
a
shapeless
spineless
thing
had
attained
mesozoic
structure
it
was
marching
along
surely
even
jauntily
toward
a
climax
as
a
play
should
as
a
day
should
he
dreaded
the
moment
when
the
backbone
of
the
day
should
be
broken
when
he
should
have
met
the
girl
at
last
talked
to
her
and
then
bowed
her
laughter
out
the
door
returning
only
to
the
melancholy
dregs
in
the
teacups
and
the
gathering
staleness
of
the
uneaten
sandwiches
there
was
a
growing
lack
of
color
in
anthony
days
he
felt
it
constantly
and
sometimes
traced
it
to
a
talk
he
had
had
with
maury
noble
a
month
before
that
anything
so
ingenuous
so
priggish
as
a
sense
of
waste
should
oppress
him
was
absurd
but
there
was
no
denying
the
fact
that
some
unwelcome
survival
of
a
fetish
had
drawn
him
three
weeks
before
down
to
the
public
library
where
by
the
token
of
richard
caramel
card
he
had
drawn
out
half
a
dozen
books
on
the
italian
renaissance
that
these
books
were
still
piled
on
his
desk
in
the
original
order
of
carriage
that
they
were
daily
increasing
his
liabilities
by
twelve
cents
was
no
mitigation
of
their
testimony
they
were
cloth
and
morocco
witnesses
to
the
fact
of
his
defection
anthony
had
had
several
hours
of
acute
and
startling
panic
in
justification
of
his
manner
of
living
there
was
first
of
course
the
meaninglessness
of
life
as
aides
and
ministers
pages
and
squires
butlers
and
lackeys
to
this
great
khan
there
were
a
thousand
books
glowing
on
his
shelves
there
was
his
apartment
and
all
the
money
that
was
to
be
his
when
the
old
man
up
the
river
should
choke
on
his
last
morality
from
a
world
fraught
with
the
menace
of
débutantes
and
the
stupidity
of
many
geraldines
he
was
thankfully
delivered
rather
should
he
emulate
the
feline
immobility
of
maury
and
wear
proudly
the
culminative
wisdom
of
the
numbered
generations
over
and
against
these
things
was
something
which
his
brain
persistently
analyzed
and
dealt
with
as
a
tiresome
complex
but
which
though
logically
disposed
of
and
bravely
trampled
under
foot
had
sent
him
out
through
the
soft
slush
of
late
november
to
a
library
which
had
none
of
the
books
he
most
wanted
it
is
fair
to
analyze
anthony
as
far
as
he
could
analyze
himself
further
than
that
it
is
of
course
presumption
he
found
in
himself
a
growing
horror
and
loneliness
the
idea
of
eating
alone
frightened
him
in
preference
he
dined
often
with
men
he
detested
travel
which
had
once
charmed
him
seemed
at
length
unendurable
a
business
of
color
without
substance
a
phantom
chase
after
his
own
dream
shadow
if
i
am
essentially
weak
he
thought
i
need
work
to
do
work
to
do
it
worried
him
to
think
that
he
was
after
all
a
facile
mediocrity
with
neither
the
poise
of
maury
nor
the
enthusiasm
of
dick
it
seemed
a
tragedy
to
want
nothing
and
yet
he
wanted
something
something
he
knew
in
flashes
what
it
was
some
path
of
hope
to
lead
him
toward
what
he
thought
was
an
imminent
and
ominous
old
age
after
cocktails
and
luncheon
at
the
university
club
anthony
felt
better
he
had
run
into
two
men
from
his
class
at
harvard
and
in
contrast
to
the
gray
heaviness
of
their
conversation
his
life
assumed
color
both
of
them
were
married
one
spent
his
coffee
time
in
sketching
an
adventure
to
the
bland
and
appreciative
smiles
of
the
other
both
of
them
he
thought
were
gilberts
in
embryo
the
number
of
their
yes
would
have
to
be
quadrupled
their
natures
crabbed
by
twenty
years
then
they
would
be
no
more
than
obsolete
and
broken
machines
and
valueless
nursed
to
an
utter
senility
by
the
women
they
had
broken
ah
he
was
more
than
that
as
he
paced
the
long
carpet
in
the
lounge
after
dinner
pausing
at
the
window
to
look
into
the
harried
street
he
was
anthony
patch
brilliant
magnetic
the
heir
of
many
years
and
many
men
this
was
his
world
now
and
that
last
strong
irony
he
craved
lay
in
the
offing
with
a
stray
boyishness
he
saw
himself
a
power
upon
the
earth
with
his
grandfather
money
he
might
build
his
own
pedestal
and
be
a
talleyrand
a
lord
verulam
the
clarity
of
his
mind
its
sophistication
its
versatile
intelligence
all
at
their
maturity
and
dominated
by
some
purpose
yet
to
be
born
would
find
him
work
to
do
on
this
minor
his
dream
faded
work
to
do
he
tried
to
imagine
himself
in
congress
rooting
around
in
the
litter
of
that
incredible
pigsty
with
the
narrow
and
porcine
brows
he
saw
pictured
sometimes
in
the
rotogravure
sections
of
the
sunday
newspapers
those
glorified
proletarians
babbling
blandly
to
the
nation
the
ideas
of
high
school
seniors
little
men
with
ambitions
who
by
mediocrity
had
thought
to
emerge
from
mediocrity
into
the
lustreless
and
unromantic
heaven
of
a
government
by
the
people
and
the
best
the
dozen
shrewd
men
at
the
top
egotistic
and
cynical
were
content
to
lead
this
choir
of
white
ties
and
wire
in
a
discordant
and
amazing
hymn
compounded
of
a
vague
confusion
between
wealth
as
a
reward
of
virtue
and
wealth
as
a
proof
of
vice
and
continued
cheers
for
god
the
constitution
and
the
rocky
mountains
lord
verulam
talleyrand
back
in
his
apartment
the
grayness
returned
his
cocktails
had
died
making
him
sleepy
somewhat
befogged
and
inclined
to
be
surly
lord
verulam
he
the
very
thought
was
bitter
anthony
patch
with
no
record
of
achievement
without
courage
without
strength
to
be
satisfied
with
truth
when
it
was
given
him
oh
he
was
a
pretentious
fool
making
careers
out
of
cocktails
and
meanwhile
regretting
weakly
and
secretly
the
collapse
of
an
insufficient
and
wretched
idealism
he
had
garnished
his
soul
in
the
subtlest
taste
and
now
he
longed
for
the
old
rubbish
he
was
empty
it
seemed
empty
as
an
old
bottle
the
buzzer
rang
at
the
door
anthony
sprang
up
and
lifted
the
tube
to
his
ear
it
was
richard
caramel
voice
stilted
and
facetious
announcing
miss
gloria
gilbert
how
do
you
do
he
said
smiling
and
holding
the
door
ajar
dick
bowed
gloria
this
is
anthony
well
she
cried
holding
out
a
little
gloved
hand
under
her
fur
coat
her
dress
was
with
white
lace
crinkled
stiffly
about
her
throat
let
me
take
your
things
anthony
stretched
out
his
arms
and
the
brown
mass
of
fur
tumbled
into
them
thanks
what
do
you
think
of
her
anthony
richard
caramel
demanded
barbarously
is
she
beautiful
well
cried
the
girl
defiantly
withal
unmoved
she
was
dazzling
alight
it
was
agony
to
comprehend
her
beauty
in
a
glance
her
hair
full
of
a
heavenly
glamour
was
gay
against
the
winter
color
of
the
room
anthony
moved
about
turning
the
mushroom
lamp
into
an
orange
glory
the
stirred
fire
burnished
the
copper
andirons
on
the
hearth
i
a
solid
block
of
ice
murmured
gloria
casually
glancing
around
with
eyes
whose
irises
were
of
the
most
delicate
and
transparent
bluish
white
what
a
slick
fire
we
found
a
place
where
you
could
stand
on
an
grating
sort
of
and
it
blew
warm
air
up
at
you
but
dick
would
wait
there
with
me
i
told
him
to
go
on
alone
and
let
me
be
happy
conventional
enough
this
she
seemed
talking
for
her
own
pleasure
without
effort
anthony
sitting
at
one
end
of
the
sofa
examined
her
profile
against
the
foreground
of
the
lamp
the
exquisite
regularity
of
nose
and
upper
lip
the
chin
faintly
decided
balanced
beautifully
on
a
rather
short
neck
on
a
photograph
she
must
have
been
completely
classical
almost
cold
but
the
glow
of
her
hair
and
cheeks
at
once
flushed
and
fragile
made
her
the
most
living
person
he
had
ever
seen
think
you
got
the
best
name
i
heard
she
was
saying
still
apparently
to
herself
her
glance
rested
on
him
a
moment
and
then
flitted
past
him
to
the
italian
clinging
like
luminous
yellow
turtles
at
intervals
along
the
walls
to
the
books
row
upon
row
then
to
her
cousin
on
the
other
side
anthony
patch
only
you
ought
to
look
sort
of
like
a
horse
with
a
long
narrow
face
and
you
ought
to
be
in
tatters
that
all
the
patch
part
though
how
should
anthony
look
you
look
like
anthony
she
assured
him
seriously
he
thought
she
had
scarcely
seen
him
rather
majestic
she
continued
and
solemn
anthony
indulged
in
a
disconcerted
smile
only
i
like
alliterative
names
she
went
on
all
except
mine
too
flamboyant
i
used
to
know
two
girls
named
jinks
though
and
just
think
if
they
been
named
anything
except
what
they
were
named
judy
jinks
and
jerry
jinks
cute
what
do
you
think
her
childish
mouth
was
parted
awaiting
a
rejoinder
everybody
in
the
next
generation
suggested
dick
will
be
named
peter
or
barbara
because
at
present
all
the
piquant
literary
characters
are
named
peter
or
barbara
anthony
continued
the
prophecy
of
course
gladys
and
eleanor
having
graced
the
last
generation
of
heroines
and
being
at
present
in
their
social
prime
will
be
passed
on
to
the
next
generation
of
displacing
ella
and
stella
interrupted
dick
and
pearl
and
jewel
gloria
added
cordially
and
earl
and
elmer
and
minnie
and
then
i
come
along
remarked
dick
and
picking
up
the
obsolete
name
jewel
i
attach
it
to
some
quaint
and
attractive
character
and
it
start
its
career
all
over
again
her
voice
took
up
the
thread
of
subject
and
wove
along
with
faintly
upturning
intonations
for
sentence
ends
as
though
defying
interruption
and
intervals
of
shadowy
laughter
dick
had
told
her
that
anthony
man
was
named
bounds
she
thought
that
was
wonderful
dick
had
made
some
sad
pun
about
bounds
doing
patchwork
but
if
there
was
one
thing
worse
than
a
pun
she
said
it
was
a
person
who
as
the
inevitable
to
a
pun
gave
the
perpetrator
a
look
where
are
you
from
inquired
anthony
he
knew
but
beauty
had
rendered
him
thoughtless
kansas
city
missouri
they
put
her
out
the
same
time
they
barred
cigarettes
did
they
bar
cigarettes
i
see
the
hand
of
my
holy
grandfather
he
a
reformer
or
something
is
he
i
blush
for
him
so
do
i
she
confessed
i
detest
reformers
especially
the
sort
who
try
to
reform
me
are
there
many
of
those
dozens
it
gloria
if
you
smoke
so
many
cigarettes
you
lose
your
pretty
complexion
and
gloria
why
do
you
marry
and
settle
down
anthony
agreed
emphatically
while
he
wondered
who
had
had
the
temerity
to
speak
thus
to
such
a
personage
and
then
she
continued
there
are
all
the
subtle
reformers
who
tell
you
the
wild
stories
they
heard
about
you
and
how
they
been
sticking
up
for
you
he
saw
at
length
that
her
eyes
were
gray
very
level
and
cool
and
when
they
rested
on
him
he
understood
what
maury
had
meant
by
saying
she
was
very
young
and
very
old
she
talked
always
about
herself
as
a
very
charming
child
might
talk
and
her
comments
on
her
tastes
and
distastes
were
unaffected
and
spontaneous
i
must
confess
said
anthony
gravely
that
even
heard
one
thing
about
you
alert
at
once
she
sat
up
straight
those
eyes
with
the
grayness
and
eternity
of
a
cliff
of
soft
granite
caught
his
tell
me
i
believe
it
i
always
believe
anything
any
one
tells
me
about
myself
do
you
invariably
agreed
the
two
men
in
unison
well
tell
me
i
not
sure
that
i
ought
to
teased
anthony
smiling
unwillingly
she
was
so
obviously
interested
in
a
state
of
almost
laughable
he
means
your
nickname
said
her
cousin
what
name
inquired
anthony
politely
puzzled
instantly
she
was
shy
then
she
laughed
rolled
back
against
the
cushions
and
turned
her
eyes
up
as
she
spoke
gloria
her
voice
was
full
of
laughter
laughter
undefined
as
the
varying
shadows
playing
between
fire
and
lamp
upon
her
hair
o
lord
still
anthony
was
puzzled
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
what
some
silly
boys
coined
for
do
you
see
anthony
explained
dick
traveller
of
a
notoriety
and
all
that
is
that
what
you
heard
she
been
called
that
for
years
since
she
was
seventeen
anthony
eyes
became
sad
and
humorous
who
this
female
methuselah
you
brought
in
here
caramel
she
disregarded
this
possibly
rather
resented
it
for
she
switched
back
to
the
main
topic
what
you
heard
of
me
something
about
your
physique
oh
she
said
coolly
disappointed
that
all
your
tan
my
tan
she
was
puzzled
her
hand
rose
to
her
throat
rested
there
an
instant
as
though
the
fingers
were
feeling
variants
of
color
do
you
remember
maury
noble
man
you
met
about
a
month
ago
you
made
a
great
impression
she
thought
a
moment
i
remember
but
he
did
call
me
up
he
was
afraid
to
i
do
doubt
it
was
black
dark
without
now
and
anthony
wondered
that
his
apartment
had
ever
seemed
gray
so
warm
and
friendly
were
the
books
and
pictures
on
the
walls
and
the
good
bounds
offering
tea
from
a
respectful
shadow
and
the
three
nice
people
giving
out
waves
of
interest
and
laughter
back
and
forth
across
the
happy
fire
dissatisfaction
on
thursday
afternoon
gloria
and
anthony
had
tea
together
in
the
grill
room
at
the
plaza
her
suit
was
gray
because
with
gray
you
to
wear
a
lot
of
paint
she
explained
and
a
small
toque
sat
rakishly
on
her
head
allowing
yellow
ripples
of
hair
to
wave
out
in
jaunty
glory
in
the
higher
light
it
seemed
to
anthony
that
her
personality
was
infinitely
softer
she
seemed
so
young
scarcely
eighteen
her
form
under
the
tight
sheath
known
then
as
a
was
amazingly
supple
and
slender
and
her
hands
neither
artistic
nor
stubby
were
small
as
a
child
hands
should
be
as
they
entered
the
orchestra
were
sounding
the
preliminary
whimpers
to
a
maxixe
a
tune
full
of
castanets
and
facile
faintly
languorous
violin
harmonies
appropriate
to
the
crowded
winter
grill
teeming
with
an
excited
college
crowd
at
the
approach
of
the
holidays
carefully
gloria
considered
several
locations
and
rather
to
annoyance
paraded
him
circuitously
to
a
table
for
two
at
the
far
side
of
the
room
reaching
it
she
again
considered
would
she
sit
on
the
right
or
on
the
left
her
beautiful
eyes
and
lips
were
very
grave
as
she
made
her
choice
and
anthony
thought
again
how
naïve
was
her
every
gesture
she
took
all
the
things
of
life
for
hers
to
choose
from
and
apportion
as
though
she
were
continually
picking
out
presents
for
herself
from
an
inexhaustible
counter
abstractedly
she
watched
the
dancers
for
a
few
moments
commenting
murmurously
as
a
couple
eddied
near
there
a
pretty
girl
in
blue
and
as
anthony
looked
obediently
there
no
behind
you
there
yes
he
agreed
helplessly
you
did
see
her
i
rather
look
at
you
i
know
but
she
was
pretty
except
that
she
had
big
ankles
was
she
i
mean
did
she
he
said
indifferently
a
girl
salutation
came
from
a
couple
dancing
close
to
them
hello
gloria
o
gloria
hello
there
who
that
he
demanded
i
do
know
somebody
she
caught
sight
of
another
face
hello
muriel
then
to
anthony
there
muriel
kane
now
i
think
attractive
not
very
anthony
chuckled
appreciatively
attractive
not
very
he
repeated
she
smiled
was
interested
immediately
why
is
that
funny
her
tone
was
pathetically
intent
it
just
was
do
you
want
to
dance
do
you
sort
of
but
let
sit
she
decided
and
talk
about
you
you
love
to
talk
about
you
do
you
yes
caught
in
a
vanity
she
laughed
i
imagine
your
autobiography
would
be
a
classic
dick
says
i
have
got
one
dick
he
exclaimed
what
does
he
know
about
you
nothing
but
he
says
the
biography
of
every
woman
begins
with
the
first
kiss
that
counts
and
ends
when
her
last
child
is
laid
in
her
arms
he
talking
from
his
book
he
says
unloved
women
have
no
biographies
they
have
histories
anthony
laughed
again
surely
you
do
claim
to
be
unloved
well
i
suppose
not
then
why
have
you
a
biography
have
you
ever
had
a
kiss
that
counted
as
the
words
left
his
lips
he
drew
in
his
breath
sharply
as
though
to
suck
them
back
this
i
do
know
what
you
mean
she
objected
i
wish
you
tell
me
how
old
you
are
she
said
meeting
his
eyes
gravely
how
old
did
you
think
about
eighteen
i
going
to
start
being
that
i
do
like
being
i
hate
it
more
than
anything
in
the
world
being
no
getting
old
and
everything
getting
married
do
you
ever
want
to
marry
i
do
want
to
have
responsibility
and
a
lot
of
children
to
take
care
of
evidently
she
did
not
doubt
that
on
her
lips
all
things
were
good
he
waited
rather
breathlessly
for
her
next
remark
expecting
it
to
follow
up
her
last
she
was
smiling
without
amusement
but
pleasantly
and
after
an
interval
half
a
dozen
words
fell
into
the
space
between
them
i
wish
i
had
some
you
shall
he
beckoned
to
a
waiter
and
sent
him
to
the
cigar
counter
mind
i
love
everybody
kids
me
about
it
because
always
whacking
away
at
one
whenever
my
daddy
not
around
not
at
who
are
all
these
children
he
asked
suddenly
do
you
know
them
all
why
no
but
they
from
oh
from
everywhere
i
suppose
do
you
ever
come
here
very
seldom
i
do
care
particularly
for
girls
immediately
he
had
her
attention
she
turned
a
definite
shoulder
to
the
dancers
relaxed
in
her
chair
and
demanded
what
you
do
with
yourself
thanks
to
a
cocktail
anthony
welcomed
the
question
in
a
mood
to
talk
he
wanted
moreover
to
impress
this
girl
whose
interest
seemed
so
tantalizingly
elusive
she
stopped
to
browse
in
unexpected
pastures
hurried
quickly
over
the
inobviously
obvious
he
wanted
to
pose
he
wanted
to
appear
suddenly
to
her
in
novel
and
heroic
colors
he
wanted
to
stir
her
from
that
casualness
she
showed
toward
everything
except
herself
i
do
nothing
he
began
realizing
simultaneously
that
his
words
were
to
lack
the
debonair
grace
he
craved
for
them
i
do
nothing
for
there
nothing
i
can
do
that
worth
doing
well
he
had
neither
surprised
her
nor
even
held
her
yet
she
had
certainly
understood
him
if
indeed
he
had
said
aught
worth
understanding
do
you
approve
of
lazy
men
she
nodded
i
suppose
so
if
they
gracefully
lazy
is
that
possible
for
an
american
why
not
he
demanded
discomfited
but
her
mind
had
left
the
subject
and
wandered
up
ten
floors
my
daddy
mad
at
me
she
observed
dispassionately
why
but
i
want
to
know
just
why
it
impossible
for
an
american
to
be
gracefully
idle
his
words
gathered
conviction
it
astonishes
me
it
it
i
do
understand
why
people
think
that
every
young
man
ought
to
go
and
work
ten
hours
a
day
for
the
best
twenty
years
of
his
life
at
dull
unimaginative
work
certainly
not
altruistic
work
he
broke
off
she
watched
him
inscrutably
he
waited
for
her
to
agree
or
disagree
but
she
did
neither
do
you
ever
form
judgments
on
things
he
asked
with
some
exasperation
she
shook
her
head
and
her
eyes
wandered
back
to
the
dancers
as
she
answered
i
do
know
i
do
know
anything
about
what
you
should
do
or
what
anybody
should
do
she
confused
him
and
hindered
the
flow
of
his
ideas
had
never
seemed
at
once
so
desirable
and
so
impossible
well
he
admitted
apologetically
neither
do
i
of
course
but
i
just
think
of
people
she
continued
whether
they
seem
right
where
they
are
and
fit
into
the
picture
i
do
mind
if
they
do
do
anything
i
do
see
why
they
should
in
fact
it
always
astonishes
me
when
anybody
does
anything
you
do
want
to
do
anything
i
want
to
sleep
for
a
second
he
was
startled
almost
as
though
she
had
meant
this
literally
sleep
sort
of
i
want
to
just
be
lazy
and
i
want
some
of
the
people
around
me
to
be
doing
things
because
that
makes
me
feel
comfortable
and
safe
and
i
want
some
of
them
to
be
doing
nothing
at
all
because
they
can
be
graceful
and
companionable
for
me
but
i
never
want
to
change
people
or
get
excited
over
them
you
a
quaint
little
determinist
laughed
anthony
it
your
world
is
it
well
she
said
with
a
quick
upward
glance
is
it
as
long
as
i
young
she
had
paused
slightly
before
the
last
word
and
anthony
suspected
that
she
had
started
to
say
beautiful
it
was
undeniably
what
she
had
intended
her
eyes
brightened
and
he
waited
for
her
to
enlarge
on
the
theme
he
had
drawn
her
out
at
any
rate
he
bent
forward
slightly
to
catch
the
words
but
let
dance
was
all
she
said
admiration
that
winter
afternoon
at
the
plaza
was
the
first
of
a
succession
of
dates
anthony
made
with
her
in
the
blurred
and
stimulating
days
before
christmas
invariably
she
was
busy
what
particular
strata
of
the
social
life
claimed
her
he
was
a
long
time
finding
out
it
seemed
to
matter
very
little
she
attended
the
charity
dances
at
the
big
hotels
he
saw
her
several
times
at
dinner
parties
in
sherry
and
once
as
he
waited
for
her
to
dress
gilbert
apropos
of
her
daughter
habit
of
going
rattled
off
an
amazing
holiday
programme
that
included
half
a
dozen
dances
to
which
anthony
had
received
cards
he
made
engagements
with
her
several
times
for
lunch
and
tea
the
former
were
hurried
and
to
him
at
least
rather
unsatisfactory
occasions
for
she
was
and
casual
incapable
of
concentrating
upon
anything
or
of
giving
consecutive
attention
to
his
remarks
when
after
two
of
these
sallow
meals
he
accused
her
of
tendering
him
the
skin
and
bones
of
the
day
she
laughed
and
gave
him
a
three
days
off
this
was
infinitely
more
satisfactory
one
sunday
afternoon
just
before
christmas
he
called
up
and
found
her
in
the
lull
directly
after
some
important
but
mysterious
quarrel
she
informed
him
in
a
tone
of
mingled
wrath
and
amusement
that
she
had
sent
a
man
out
of
her
apartment
here
anthony
speculated
violently
and
that
the
man
had
been
giving
a
little
dinner
for
her
that
very
night
and
that
of
course
she
was
going
so
anthony
took
her
to
supper
let
go
to
something
she
proposed
as
they
went
down
in
the
elevator
i
want
to
see
a
show
do
you
inquiry
at
the
hotel
ticket
desk
disclosed
only
two
sunday
night
concerts
they
always
the
same
she
complained
unhappily
same
old
yiddish
comedians
oh
let
go
somewhere
to
conceal
a
guilty
suspicion
that
he
should
have
arranged
a
performance
of
some
kind
for
her
approval
anthony
affected
a
knowing
cheerfulness
we
go
to
a
good
cabaret
i
seen
every
one
in
town
well
we
find
a
new
one
she
was
in
wretched
humor
that
was
evident
her
gray
eyes
were
granite
now
indeed
when
she
was
speaking
she
stared
straight
in
front
of
her
as
if
at
some
distasteful
abstraction
in
the
lobby
well
come
on
then
he
followed
her
a
graceful
girl
even
in
her
enveloping
fur
out
to
a
taxicab
and
with
an
air
of
having
a
definite
place
in
mind
instructed
the
driver
to
go
over
to
broadway
and
then
turn
south
he
made
several
casual
attempts
at
conversation
but
as
she
adopted
an
impenetrable
armor
of
silence
and
answered
him
in
sentences
as
morose
as
the
cold
darkness
of
the
taxicab
he
gave
up
and
assuming
a
like
mood
fell
into
a
dim
gloom
a
dozen
blocks
down
broadway
anthony
eyes
were
caught
by
a
large
and
unfamiliar
electric
sign
spelling
marathon
in
glorious
yellow
script
adorned
with
electrical
leaves
and
flowers
that
alternately
vanished
and
beamed
upon
the
wet
and
glistening
street
he
leaned
and
rapped
on
the
and
in
a
moment
was
receiving
information
from
a
colored
doorman
yes
this
was
a
cabaret
fine
cabaret
bes
showina
city
shall
we
try
it
with
a
sigh
gloria
tossed
her
cigarette
out
the
open
door
and
prepared
to
follow
it
then
they
had
passed
under
the
screaming
sign
under
the
wide
portal
and
up
by
a
stuffy
elevator
into
this
unsung
palace
of
pleasure
the
gay
habitats
of
the
very
rich
and
the
very
poor
the
very
dashing
and
the
very
criminal
not
to
mention
the
lately
exploited
very
bohemian
are
made
known
to
the
awed
high
school
girls
of
augusta
georgia
and
redwing
minnesota
not
only
through
the
bepictured
and
entrancing
spreads
of
the
sunday
theatrical
supplements
but
through
the
shocked
and
alarmful
eyes
of
rupert
hughes
and
other
chroniclers
of
the
mad
pace
of
america
but
the
excursions
of
harlem
onto
broadway
the
deviltries
of
the
dull
and
the
revelries
of
the
respectable
are
a
matter
of
esoteric
knowledge
only
to
the
participants
themselves
a
tip
circulates
and
in
the
place
knowingly
mentioned
gather
the
lower
on
saturday
and
sunday
nights
the
little
troubled
men
who
are
pictured
in
the
comics
as
the
consumer
or
the
public
they
have
made
sure
that
the
place
has
three
qualifications
it
is
cheap
it
imitates
with
a
sort
of
shoddy
and
mechanical
wistfulness
the
glittering
antics
of
the
great
cafes
in
the
theatre
district
and
this
above
all
important
it
is
a
place
where
they
can
take
a
nice
girl
which
means
of
course
that
every
one
has
become
equally
harmless
timid
and
uninteresting
through
lack
of
money
and
imagination
there
on
sunday
nights
gather
the
credulous
sentimental
underpaid
overworked
people
with
hyphenated
occupations
salesmen
and
most
of
all
clerks
clerks
of
the
express
of
the
mail
of
the
grocery
of
the
brokerage
of
the
bank
with
them
are
their
giggling
pathetically
pretentious
women
who
grow
fat
with
them
bear
them
too
many
babies
and
float
helpless
and
uncontent
in
a
colorless
sea
of
drudgery
and
broken
hopes
they
name
these
brummagem
cabarets
after
pullman
cars
the
marathon
not
for
them
the
salacious
similes
borrowed
from
the
cafés
of
paris
this
is
where
their
docile
patrons
bring
their
nice
women
whose
starved
fancies
are
only
too
willing
to
believe
that
the
scene
is
comparatively
gay
and
joyous
and
even
faintly
immoral
this
is
life
who
cares
for
the
morrow
abandoned
people
anthony
and
gloria
seated
looked
about
them
at
the
next
table
a
party
of
four
were
in
process
of
being
joined
by
a
party
of
three
two
men
and
a
girl
who
were
evidently
late
and
the
manner
of
the
girl
was
a
study
in
national
sociology
she
was
meeting
some
new
men
and
she
was
pretending
desperately
by
gesture
she
was
pretending
and
by
words
and
by
the
scarcely
perceptible
motionings
of
her
eyelids
that
she
belonged
to
a
class
a
little
superior
to
the
class
with
which
she
now
had
to
do
that
a
while
ago
she
had
been
and
presently
would
again
be
in
a
higher
rarer
air
she
was
almost
painfully
refined
she
wore
a
last
year
hat
covered
with
violets
no
more
yearningly
pretentious
and
palpably
artificial
than
herself
fascinated
anthony
and
gloria
watched
the
girl
sit
down
and
radiate
the
impression
that
she
was
only
condescendingly
present
for
her
eyes
said
this
is
practically
a
slumming
expedition
to
be
cloaked
with
belittling
laughter
and
and
the
other
women
passionately
poured
out
the
impression
that
though
they
were
in
the
crowd
they
were
not
of
it
this
was
not
the
sort
of
place
to
which
they
were
accustomed
they
had
dropped
in
because
it
was
near
by
and
convenient
every
party
in
the
restaurant
poured
out
that
impression
who
knew
they
were
forever
changing
class
all
of
them
the
women
often
marrying
above
their
opportunities
the
men
striking
suddenly
a
magnificent
opulence
a
sufficiently
preposterous
advertising
scheme
a
celestialized
ice
cream
cone
meanwhile
they
met
here
to
eat
closing
their
eyes
to
the
economy
displayed
in
infrequent
changings
of
in
the
casualness
of
the
cabaret
performers
most
of
all
in
the
colloquial
carelessness
and
familiarity
of
the
waiters
one
was
sure
that
these
waiters
were
not
impressed
by
their
patrons
one
expected
that
presently
they
would
sit
at
the
tables
do
you
object
to
this
inquired
anthony
gloria
face
warmed
and
for
the
first
time
that
evening
she
smiled
i
love
it
she
said
frankly
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
her
her
gray
eyes
roved
here
and
there
drowsing
idle
or
alert
on
each
group
passing
to
the
next
with
unconcealed
enjoyment
and
to
anthony
were
made
plain
the
different
values
of
her
profile
the
wonderfully
alive
expressions
of
her
mouth
and
the
authentic
distinction
of
face
and
form
and
manner
that
made
her
like
a
single
flower
amidst
a
collection
of
cheap
at
her
happiness
a
gorgeous
sentiment
welled
into
his
eyes
choked
him
up
set
his
nerves
and
filled
his
throat
with
husky
and
vibrant
emotion
there
was
a
hush
upon
the
room
the
careless
violins
and
saxophones
the
shrill
rasping
complaint
of
a
child
near
by
the
voice
of
the
girl
at
the
next
table
all
moved
slowly
out
receded
and
fell
away
like
shadowy
reflections
on
the
shining
floor
and
they
two
it
seemed
to
him
were
alone
and
infinitely
remote
quiet
surely
the
freshness
of
her
cheeks
was
a
gossamer
projection
from
a
land
of
delicate
and
undiscovered
shades
her
hand
gleaming
on
the
stained
was
a
shell
from
some
far
and
wildly
virginal
sea
then
the
illusion
snapped
like
a
nest
of
threads
the
room
grouped
itself
around
him
voices
faces
movement
the
garish
shimmer
of
the
lights
overhead
became
real
became
portentous
breath
began
the
slow
respiration
that
she
and
he
took
in
time
with
this
docile
hundred
the
rise
and
fall
of
bosoms
the
eternal
meaningless
play
and
interplay
and
tossing
and
reiterating
of
word
and
phrase
all
these
wrenched
his
senses
open
to
the
suffocating
pressure
of
life
and
then
her
voice
came
at
him
cool
as
the
suspended
dream
he
had
left
behind
i
belong
here
she
murmured
i
like
these
people
for
an
instant
this
seemed
a
sardonic
and
unnecessary
paradox
hurled
at
him
across
the
impassable
distances
she
created
about
herself
her
entrancement
had
increased
her
eyes
rested
upon
a
semitic
violinist
who
swayed
his
shoulders
to
the
rhythm
of
the
year
mellowest
something
goes
right
ear
again
she
spoke
from
the
centre
of
this
pervasive
illusion
of
her
own
it
amazed
him
it
was
like
blasphemy
from
the
mouth
of
a
child
i
like
they
are
like
japanese
lanterns
and
crape
paper
and
the
music
of
that
orchestra
you
a
young
idiot
he
insisted
wildly
she
shook
her
blond
head
no
i
not
i
like
them
you
ought
to
see
you
do
know
me
she
hesitated
and
her
eyes
came
back
to
him
rested
abruptly
on
his
as
though
surprised
at
the
last
to
see
him
there
i
got
a
streak
of
what
you
call
cheapness
i
do
know
where
i
get
it
but
it
oh
things
like
this
and
bright
colors
and
gaudy
vulgarity
i
seem
to
belong
here
these
people
could
appreciate
me
and
take
me
for
granted
and
these
men
would
fall
in
love
with
me
and
admire
me
whereas
the
clever
men
i
meet
would
just
analyze
me
and
tell
me
i
this
because
of
this
or
that
because
of
that
anthony
for
the
moment
wanted
fiercely
to
paint
her
to
set
her
down
as
she
was
as
as
with
each
relentless
second
she
could
never
be
again
what
were
you
thinking
she
asked
just
that
i
not
a
realist
he
said
and
then
no
only
the
romanticist
preserves
the
things
worth
preserving
out
of
the
deep
sophistication
of
anthony
an
understanding
formed
nothing
atavistic
or
obscure
indeed
scarcely
physical
at
all
an
understanding
remembered
from
the
romancings
of
many
generations
of
minds
that
as
she
talked
and
caught
his
eyes
and
turned
her
lovely
head
she
moved
him
as
he
had
never
been
moved
before
the
sheath
that
held
her
soul
had
assumed
significance
that
was
all
she
was
a
sun
radiant
growing
gathering
light
and
storing
it
then
after
an
eternity
pouring
it
forth
in
a
glance
the
fragment
of
a
sentence
to
that
part
of
him
that
cherished
all
beauty
and
all
illusion
chapter
iii
the
connoisseur
of
kisses
from
his
undergraduate
days
as
editor
of
the
harvard
crimson
richard
caramel
had
desired
to
write
but
as
a
senior
he
had
picked
up
the
glorified
illusion
that
certain
men
were
set
aside
for
service
and
going
into
the
world
were
to
accomplish
a
vague
yearnful
something
which
would
react
either
in
eternal
reward
or
at
the
least
in
the
personal
satisfaction
of
having
striven
for
the
greatest
good
of
the
greatest
number
this
spirit
has
long
rocked
the
colleges
in
america
it
begins
as
a
rule
during
the
immaturities
and
facile
impressions
of
freshman
year
sometimes
back
in
preparatory
school
prosperous
apostles
known
for
their
emotional
acting
go
the
rounds
of
the
universities
and
by
frightening
the
amiable
sheep
and
dulling
the
quickening
of
interest
and
intellectual
curiosity
which
is
the
purpose
of
all
education
distil
a
mysterious
conviction
of
sin
harking
back
to
childhood
crimes
and
to
the
menace
of
women
to
these
lectures
go
the
wicked
youths
to
cheer
and
joke
and
the
timid
to
swallow
the
tasty
pills
which
would
be
harmless
if
administered
to
farmers
wives
and
pious
but
are
rather
dangerous
medicine
for
these
future
leaders
of
men
this
octopus
was
strong
enough
to
wind
a
sinuous
tentacle
about
richard
caramel
the
year
after
his
graduation
it
called
him
into
the
slums
of
new
york
to
muck
about
with
bewildered
italians
as
secretary
to
an
alien
young
men
rescue
association
he
labored
at
it
over
a
year
before
the
monotony
began
to
weary
him
the
aliens
kept
coming
inexhaustibly
italians
poles
scandinavians
czechs
armenians
with
the
same
wrongs
the
same
exceptionally
ugly
faces
and
very
much
the
same
smells
though
he
fancied
that
these
grew
more
profuse
and
diverse
as
the
months
passed
his
eventual
conclusions
about
the
expediency
of
service
were
vague
but
concerning
his
own
relation
to
it
they
were
abrupt
and
decisive
any
amiable
young
man
his
head
ringing
with
the
latest
crusade
could
accomplish
as
much
as
he
could
with
the
débris
of
europe
and
it
was
time
for
him
to
write
he
had
been
living
in
a
but
when
he
quit
the
task
of
making
purses
out
of
sows
ears
he
moved
and
went
to
work
immediately
as
a
reporter
for
the
sun
he
kept
at
this
for
a
year
doing
desultory
writing
on
the
side
with
little
success
and
then
one
day
an
infelicitous
incident
peremptorily
closed
his
newspaper
career
on
a
february
afternoon
he
was
assigned
to
report
a
parade
of
squadron
a
snow
threatening
he
went
to
sleep
instead
before
a
hot
fire
and
when
he
woke
up
did
a
smooth
column
about
the
muffled
beats
of
the
horses
hoofs
in
the
snow
this
he
handed
in
next
morning
a
marked
copy
of
the
paper
was
sent
down
to
the
city
editor
with
a
scrawled
note
fire
the
man
who
wrote
this
it
seemed
that
squadron
a
had
also
seen
the
snow
threatening
had
postponed
the
parade
until
another
day
a
week
later
he
had
begun
the
demon
in
january
the
monday
of
the
months
richard
caramel
nose
was
blue
constantly
a
sardonic
blue
vaguely
suggestive
of
the
flames
licking
around
a
sinner
his
book
was
nearly
ready
and
as
it
grew
in
completeness
it
seemed
to
grow
also
in
its
demands
sapping
him
overpowering
him
until
he
walked
haggard
and
conquered
in
its
shadow
not
only
to
anthony
and
maury
did
he
pour
out
his
hopes
and
boasts
and
indecisions
but
to
any
one
who
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
listen
he
called
on
polite
but
bewildered
publishers
he
discussed
it
with
his
casual
at
the
harvard
club
it
was
even
claimed
by
anthony
that
he
had
been
discovered
one
sunday
night
debating
the
transposition
of
chapter
two
with
a
literary
in
the
chill
and
dismal
recesses
of
a
harlem
subway
station
and
latest
among
his
confidantes
was
gilbert
who
sat
with
him
by
the
hour
and
alternated
between
bilphism
and
literature
in
an
intense
shakespeare
was
a
bilphist
she
assured
him
through
a
fixed
smile
oh
yes
he
was
a
bilphist
it
been
proved
at
this
dick
would
look
a
bit
blank
if
you
read
you
ca
help
but
see
well
he
he
lived
in
a
more
credulous
age
a
more
religious
age
but
she
demanded
the
whole
loaf
oh
yes
but
you
see
bilphism
is
a
religion
it
the
science
of
all
religions
she
smiled
defiantly
at
him
this
was
the
of
her
belief
there
was
something
in
the
arrangement
of
words
which
grasped
her
mind
so
definitely
that
the
statement
became
superior
to
any
obligation
to
define
itself
it
is
not
unlikely
that
she
would
have
accepted
any
idea
encased
in
this
radiant
formula
which
was
perhaps
not
a
formula
it
was
the
ad
of
all
formulas
then
eventually
but
gorgeously
would
come
dick
turn
you
heard
of
the
new
poetry
movement
you
have
well
it
a
lot
of
young
poets
that
are
breaking
away
from
the
old
forms
and
doing
a
lot
of
good
well
what
i
was
going
to
say
was
that
my
book
is
going
to
start
a
new
prose
movement
a
sort
of
renaissance
i
sure
it
will
beamed
gilbert
i
it
will
i
went
to
jenny
martin
last
tuesday
the
palmist
you
know
that
every
one
about
i
told
her
my
nephew
was
engaged
upon
a
work
and
she
said
she
knew
i
be
glad
to
hear
that
his
success
would
be
but
she
never
seen
you
or
known
anything
about
you
not
even
your
having
made
the
proper
noises
to
express
his
amazement
at
this
astounding
phenomenon
dick
waved
her
theme
by
him
as
though
he
were
an
arbitrary
traffic
policeman
and
so
to
speak
beckoned
forward
his
own
traffic
i
absorbed
aunt
catherine
he
assured
her
i
really
am
all
my
friends
are
joshing
me
oh
i
see
the
humor
in
it
and
i
do
care
i
think
a
person
ought
to
be
able
to
take
joshing
but
i
got
a
sort
of
conviction
he
concluded
gloomily
you
an
ancient
soul
i
always
say
maybe
i
am
dick
had
reached
the
stage
where
he
no
longer
fought
but
submitted
he
be
an
ancient
soul
he
fancied
grotesquely
so
old
as
to
be
absolutely
rotten
however
the
reiteration
of
the
phrase
still
somewhat
embarrassed
him
and
sent
uncomfortable
shivers
up
his
back
he
changed
the
subject
where
is
my
distinguished
cousin
gloria
she
on
the
go
somewhere
with
some
one
dick
paused
considered
and
then
screwing
up
his
face
into
what
was
evidently
begun
as
a
smile
but
ended
as
a
terrifying
frown
delivered
a
comment
i
think
my
friend
anthony
patch
is
in
love
with
her
gilbert
started
beamed
half
a
second
too
late
and
breathed
her
really
in
the
tone
of
a
detective
i
so
corrected
dick
gravely
she
the
first
girl
i
ever
seen
him
with
so
much
well
of
course
said
gilbert
with
meticulous
carelessness
gloria
never
makes
me
her
confidante
she
very
secretive
between
you
and
me
she
bent
forward
cautiously
obviously
determined
that
only
heaven
and
her
nephew
should
share
her
confession
between
you
and
me
i
like
to
see
her
settle
down
dick
arose
and
paced
the
floor
earnestly
a
small
active
already
rotund
young
man
his
hands
thrust
unnaturally
into
his
bulging
pockets
i
not
claiming
i
right
mind
you
he
assured
the
which
smirked
respectably
back
at
him
i
saying
nothing
that
i
want
gloria
to
know
but
i
think
mad
anthony
is
interested
tremendously
so
he
talks
about
her
constantly
in
any
one
else
that
be
a
bad
sign
gloria
is
a
very
young
soul
began
gilbert
eagerly
but
her
nephew
interrupted
with
a
hurried
sentence
gloria
be
a
very
young
nut
not
to
marry
him
he
stopped
and
faced
her
his
expression
a
battle
map
of
lines
and
dimples
squeezed
and
strained
to
its
ultimate
show
of
intensity
this
as
if
to
make
up
by
his
sincerity
for
any
indiscretion
in
his
words
gloria
a
wild
one
aunt
catherine
she
uncontrollable
how
she
done
it
i
do
know
but
lately
she
picked
up
a
lot
of
the
funniest
friends
she
does
seem
to
care
and
the
men
she
used
to
go
with
around
new
york
were
he
paused
for
breath
interjected
gilbert
with
an
anaemic
attempt
to
hide
the
immense
interest
with
which
she
listened
well
continued
richard
caramel
gravely
there
it
is
i
mean
that
the
men
she
went
with
and
the
people
she
went
with
used
to
be
first
rate
now
they
are
gilbert
blinked
very
fast
her
bosom
trembled
inflated
remained
so
for
an
instant
and
with
the
exhalation
her
words
flowed
out
in
a
torrent
she
knew
she
cried
in
a
whisper
oh
yes
mothers
see
these
things
but
what
could
she
do
he
knew
gloria
he
seen
enough
of
gloria
to
know
how
hopeless
it
was
to
try
to
deal
with
her
gloria
had
been
so
spoiled
in
a
rather
complete
and
unusual
way
she
had
been
suckled
until
she
was
three
for
instance
when
she
could
probably
have
chewed
sticks
perhaps
one
never
knew
it
was
this
that
had
given
that
health
and
to
her
whole
personality
and
then
ever
since
she
was
twelve
years
old
she
had
boys
about
her
so
thick
oh
so
thick
one
could
at
sixteen
she
began
going
to
dances
at
preparatory
schools
and
then
came
the
colleges
and
everywhere
she
went
boys
boys
boys
at
first
oh
until
she
was
eighteen
there
had
been
so
many
that
it
never
seemed
one
any
more
than
the
others
but
then
she
began
to
single
them
out
she
knew
there
had
been
a
string
of
affairs
spread
over
about
three
years
perhaps
a
dozen
of
them
altogether
sometimes
the
men
were
undergraduates
sometimes
just
out
of
college
they
lasted
on
an
average
of
several
months
each
with
short
attractions
in
between
once
or
twice
they
had
endured
longer
and
her
mother
had
hoped
she
would
be
engaged
but
always
a
new
one
came
a
new
one
the
men
oh
she
made
them
miserable
literally
there
was
only
one
who
had
kept
any
sort
of
dignity
and
he
had
been
a
mere
child
young
carter
kirby
of
kansas
city
who
was
so
conceited
anyway
that
he
just
sailed
out
on
his
vanity
one
afternoon
and
left
for
europe
next
day
with
his
father
the
others
had
been
wretched
they
never
seemed
to
know
when
she
was
tired
of
them
and
gloria
had
seldom
been
deliberately
unkind
they
would
keep
phoning
writing
letters
to
her
trying
to
see
her
making
long
trips
after
her
around
the
country
some
of
them
had
confided
in
gilbert
told
her
with
tears
in
their
eyes
that
they
would
never
get
over
gloria
at
least
two
of
them
had
since
married
though
but
gloria
it
seemed
struck
to
kill
to
this
day
carstairs
called
up
once
a
week
and
sent
her
flowers
which
she
no
longer
bothered
to
refuse
several
times
twice
at
least
gilbert
knew
it
had
gone
as
far
as
a
private
engagement
with
tudor
baird
and
that
holcome
boy
at
pasadena
she
was
sure
it
had
because
this
must
go
no
further
she
had
come
in
unexpectedly
and
found
gloria
acting
well
very
much
engaged
indeed
she
had
not
spoken
to
her
daughter
of
course
she
had
had
a
certain
sense
of
delicacy
and
besides
each
time
she
had
expected
an
announcement
in
a
few
weeks
but
the
announcement
never
came
instead
a
new
man
came
scenes
young
men
walking
up
and
down
the
library
like
caged
tigers
young
men
glaring
at
each
other
in
the
hall
as
one
came
and
the
other
left
young
men
calling
up
on
the
telephone
and
being
hung
up
upon
in
desperation
young
men
threatening
south
america
young
men
writing
the
most
pathetic
letters
she
said
nothing
to
this
effect
but
dick
fancied
that
gilbert
eyes
had
seen
some
of
these
letters
and
gloria
between
tears
and
laughter
sorry
glad
out
of
love
and
in
love
miserable
nervous
cool
amidst
a
great
returning
of
presents
substitution
of
pictures
in
immemorial
frames
and
taking
of
hot
baths
and
beginning
again
with
the
next
that
state
of
things
continued
assumed
an
air
of
permanency
nothing
harmed
gloria
or
changed
her
or
moved
her
and
then
out
of
a
clear
sky
one
day
she
informed
her
mother
that
undergraduates
wearied
her
she
was
absolutely
going
to
no
more
college
dances
this
had
begun
the
change
not
so
much
in
her
actual
habits
for
she
danced
and
had
as
many
dates
as
ever
but
they
were
dates
in
a
different
spirit
previously
it
had
been
a
sort
of
pride
a
matter
of
her
own
vainglory
she
had
been
probably
the
most
celebrated
and
young
beauty
in
the
country
gloria
gilbert
of
kansas
city
she
had
fed
on
it
ruthlessly
enjoying
the
crowds
around
her
the
manner
in
which
the
most
desirable
men
singled
her
out
enjoying
the
fierce
jealousy
of
other
girls
enjoying
the
fabulous
not
to
say
scandalous
and
her
mother
was
glad
to
say
entirely
unfounded
rumors
about
her
for
instance
that
she
had
gone
in
the
yale
one
night
in
a
chiffon
evening
dress
and
from
loving
it
with
a
vanity
that
was
almost
masculine
it
had
been
in
the
nature
of
a
triumphant
and
dazzling
career
she
became
suddenly
anaesthetic
to
it
she
retired
she
who
had
dominated
countless
parties
who
had
blown
fragrantly
through
many
ballrooms
to
the
tender
tribute
of
many
eyes
seemed
to
care
no
longer
he
who
fell
in
love
with
her
now
was
dismissed
utterly
almost
angrily
she
went
listlessly
with
the
most
indifferent
men
she
continually
broke
engagements
not
as
in
the
past
from
a
cool
assurance
that
she
was
irreproachable
that
the
man
she
insulted
would
return
like
a
domestic
animal
but
indifferently
without
contempt
or
pride
she
rarely
stormed
at
men
any
more
she
yawned
at
them
she
seemed
and
it
was
so
strange
she
seemed
to
her
mother
to
be
growing
cold
richard
caramel
listened
at
first
he
had
remained
standing
but
as
his
aunt
discourse
waxed
in
content
it
stands
here
pruned
by
half
of
all
side
references
to
the
youth
of
gloria
soul
and
to
gilbert
own
mental
distresses
he
drew
a
chair
up
and
attended
rigorously
as
she
floated
between
tears
and
plaintive
helplessness
down
the
long
story
of
gloria
life
when
she
came
to
the
tale
of
this
last
year
a
tale
of
the
ends
of
cigarettes
left
all
over
new
york
in
little
trays
marked
midnight
frolic
and
justine
johnson
little
club
he
began
nodding
his
head
slowly
then
faster
and
faster
until
as
she
finished
on
a
staccato
note
it
was
bobbing
briskly
up
and
down
absurdly
like
a
doll
wired
head
expressing
almost
anything
in
a
sense
gloria
past
was
an
old
story
to
him
he
had
followed
it
with
the
eyes
of
a
journalist
for
he
was
going
to
write
a
book
about
her
some
day
but
his
interests
just
at
present
were
family
interests
he
wanted
to
know
in
particular
who
was
this
joseph
bloeckman
that
he
had
seen
her
with
several
times
and
those
two
girls
she
was
with
constantly
this
rachael
jerryl
and
this
miss
kane
surely
miss
kane
was
exactly
the
sort
one
would
associate
with
gloria
but
the
moment
had
passed
gilbert
having
climbed
the
hill
of
exposition
was
about
to
glide
swiftly
down
the
of
collapse
her
eyes
were
like
a
blue
sky
seen
through
two
round
red
the
flesh
about
her
mouth
was
trembling
and
at
the
moment
the
door
opened
admitting
into
the
room
gloria
and
the
two
young
ladies
lately
mentioned
two
young
women
well
how
do
you
do
mrs
gilbert
miss
kane
and
miss
jerryl
are
presented
to
richard
caramel
this
is
dick
laughter
i
heard
so
much
about
you
says
miss
kane
between
a
giggle
and
a
shout
how
do
you
do
says
miss
jerryl
shyly
richard
caramel
tries
to
move
about
as
if
his
figure
were
better
he
is
torn
between
his
innate
cordiality
and
the
fact
that
he
considers
these
girls
rather
common
not
at
all
the
farmover
type
gloria
has
disappeared
into
the
bedroom
do
sit
down
beams
gilbert
who
is
by
now
quite
herself
take
off
your
things
dick
is
afraid
she
will
make
some
remark
about
the
age
of
his
soul
but
he
forgets
his
qualms
in
completing
a
conscientious
novelist
examination
of
the
two
young
women
muriel
kane
had
originated
in
a
rising
family
of
east
orange
she
was
short
rather
than
small
and
hovered
audaciously
between
plumpness
and
width
her
hair
was
black
and
elaborately
arranged
this
in
conjunction
with
her
handsome
rather
bovine
eyes
and
her
lips
combined
to
make
her
resemble
theda
bara
the
prominent
motion
picture
actress
people
told
her
constantly
that
she
was
a
vampire
and
she
believed
them
she
suspected
hopefully
that
they
were
afraid
of
her
and
she
did
her
utmost
under
all
circumstances
to
give
the
impression
of
danger
an
imaginative
man
could
see
the
red
flag
that
she
constantly
carried
waving
it
wildly
beseechingly
and
alas
to
little
spectacular
avail
she
was
also
tremendously
timely
she
knew
the
latest
songs
all
the
latest
songs
when
one
of
them
was
played
on
the
phonograph
she
would
rise
to
her
feet
and
rock
her
shoulders
back
and
forth
and
snap
her
fingers
and
if
there
was
no
music
she
would
accompany
herself
by
humming
her
conversation
was
also
timely
i
do
care
she
would
say
i
should
worry
and
lose
my
figure
and
again
i
ca
make
my
feet
behave
when
i
hear
that
tune
oh
baby
her
were
too
long
and
ornate
polished
to
a
pink
and
unnatural
fever
her
clothes
were
too
tight
too
stylish
too
vivid
her
eyes
too
roguish
her
smile
too
coy
she
was
almost
pitifully
overemphasized
from
head
to
foot
the
other
girl
was
obviously
a
more
subtle
personality
she
was
an
exquisitely
dressed
jewess
with
dark
hair
and
a
lovely
milky
pallor
she
seemed
shy
and
vague
and
these
two
qualities
accentuated
a
rather
delicate
charm
that
floated
about
her
her
family
were
episcopalians
owned
three
smart
women
shops
along
fifth
avenue
and
lived
in
a
magnificent
apartment
on
riverside
drive
it
seemed
to
dick
after
a
few
moments
that
she
was
attempting
to
imitate
gloria
he
wondered
that
people
invariably
chose
inimitable
people
to
imitate
we
had
the
most
time
muriel
was
exclaiming
enthusiastically
there
was
a
crazy
woman
behind
us
on
the
bus
she
was
absitively
posolutely
she
kept
talking
to
herself
about
something
like
to
do
to
somebody
or
something
i
was
but
gloria
simply
get
off
gilbert
opened
her
mouth
properly
awed
really
oh
she
was
crazy
but
we
should
worry
she
did
hurt
us
ugly
gracious
the
man
across
from
us
said
her
face
ought
to
be
on
a
in
a
home
for
the
blind
and
we
all
naturally
so
the
man
tried
to
pick
us
up
presently
gloria
emerged
from
her
bedroom
and
in
unison
every
eye
turned
on
her
the
two
girls
receded
into
a
shadowy
background
unperceived
unmissed
we
been
talking
about
you
said
dick
quickly
your
mother
and
i
well
said
gloria
a
pause
muriel
turned
to
dick
you
a
great
writer
are
you
i
a
writer
he
confessed
sheepishly
i
always
say
said
muriel
earnestly
that
if
i
ever
had
time
to
write
down
all
my
experiences
it
make
a
wonderful
book
rachael
giggled
sympathetically
richard
caramel
bow
was
almost
stately
muriel
continued
but
i
do
see
how
you
can
sit
down
and
do
it
and
poetry
lordy
i
ca
make
two
lines
rhyme
well
i
should
worry
richard
caramel
with
difficulty
restrained
a
shout
of
laughter
gloria
was
chewing
an
amazing
and
staring
moodily
out
the
window
gilbert
cleared
her
throat
and
beamed
but
you
see
she
said
in
a
sort
of
universal
exposition
you
not
an
ancient
soul
like
richard
the
ancient
soul
breathed
a
gasp
of
relief
it
was
out
at
last
then
as
if
she
had
been
considering
it
for
five
minutes
gloria
made
a
sudden
announcement
i
going
to
give
a
party
oh
can
i
come
cried
muriel
with
facetious
daring
a
dinner
seven
people
muriel
and
rachael
and
i
and
you
dick
and
anthony
and
that
man
named
noble
i
liked
him
and
bloeckman
muriel
and
rachael
went
into
soft
and
purring
ecstasies
of
enthusiasm
gilbert
blinked
and
beamed
with
an
air
of
casualness
dick
broke
in
with
a
question
who
is
this
fellow
bloeckman
gloria
scenting
a
faint
hostility
gloria
turned
to
him
joseph
bloeckman
he
the
moving
picture
man
of
par
excellence
he
and
father
do
a
lot
of
business
oh
well
will
you
all
come
they
would
all
come
a
date
was
arranged
within
the
week
dick
rose
adjusted
hat
coat
and
muffler
and
gave
out
a
general
smile
said
muriel
waving
her
hand
gaily
call
me
up
some
time
richard
caramel
blushed
for
her
deplorable
end
of
the
chevalier
it
was
monday
and
anthony
took
geraldine
burke
to
luncheon
at
the
beaux
arts
afterward
they
went
up
to
his
apartment
and
he
wheeled
out
the
little
that
held
his
supply
of
liquor
selecting
vermouth
gin
and
absinthe
for
a
proper
stimulant
geraldine
burke
usher
at
keith
had
been
an
amusement
of
several
months
she
demanded
so
little
that
he
liked
her
for
since
a
lamentable
affair
with
a
débutante
the
preceding
summer
when
he
had
discovered
that
after
half
a
dozen
kisses
a
proposal
was
expected
he
had
been
wary
of
girls
of
his
own
class
it
was
only
too
easy
to
turn
a
critical
eye
on
their
imperfections
some
physical
harshness
or
a
general
lack
of
personal
delicacy
but
a
girl
who
was
usher
at
keith
was
approached
with
a
different
attitude
one
could
tolerate
qualities
in
an
intimate
valet
that
would
be
unforgivable
in
a
mere
acquaintance
on
social
level
geraldine
curled
up
at
the
foot
of
the
lounge
considered
him
with
narrow
slanting
eyes
you
drink
all
the
time
do
you
she
said
suddenly
why
i
suppose
so
replied
anthony
in
some
surprise
do
you
nope
i
go
on
parties
sometimes
you
know
about
once
a
week
but
i
only
take
two
or
three
drinks
you
and
your
friends
keep
on
drinking
all
the
time
i
should
think
you
ruin
your
health
anthony
was
somewhat
touched
why
are
you
sweet
to
worry
about
me
well
i
do
i
do
drink
so
very
much
he
declared
last
month
i
did
touch
a
drop
for
three
weeks
and
i
only
get
really
tight
about
once
a
week
but
you
have
something
to
drink
every
day
and
you
only
have
you
any
ambition
think
what
you
be
at
forty
i
sincerely
trust
that
i
wo
live
that
long
she
clicked
her
tongue
with
her
teeth
you
she
said
as
he
mixed
another
cocktail
and
then
are
you
any
relation
to
adam
patch
yes
he
my
grandfather
really
she
was
obviously
thrilled
absolutely
that
funny
my
daddy
used
to
work
for
him
he
a
queer
old
man
is
he
nice
she
demanded
well
in
private
life
he
seldom
unnecessarily
disagreeable
tell
us
about
him
why
anthony
considered
he
all
shrunken
up
and
he
got
the
remains
of
some
gray
hair
that
always
looks
as
though
the
wind
were
in
it
he
very
moral
he
done
a
lot
of
good
said
geraldine
with
intense
gravity
rot
scoffed
anthony
he
a
pious
ass
a
chickenbrain
her
mind
left
the
subject
and
flitted
on
why
do
you
live
with
him
why
do
i
board
in
a
methodist
parsonage
you
again
she
made
a
little
clicking
sound
to
express
disapproval
anthony
thought
how
moral
was
this
little
waif
at
heart
how
completely
moral
she
would
still
be
after
the
inevitable
wave
came
that
would
wash
her
off
the
sands
of
respectability
do
you
hate
him
i
wonder
i
never
liked
him
you
never
like
people
who
do
things
for
you
does
he
hate
you
my
dear
geraldine
protested
anthony
frowning
humorously
do
have
another
cocktail
i
annoy
him
if
i
smoke
a
cigarette
he
comes
into
the
room
sniffing
he
a
prig
a
bore
and
something
of
a
hypocrite
i
probably
would
be
telling
you
this
if
i
had
had
a
few
drinks
but
i
do
suppose
it
matters
geraldine
was
persistently
interested
she
held
her
glass
untasted
between
finger
and
thumb
and
regarded
him
with
eyes
in
which
there
was
a
touch
of
awe
how
do
you
mean
a
hypocrite
well
said
anthony
impatiently
maybe
he
not
but
he
does
like
the
things
that
i
like
and
so
as
far
as
i
concerned
uninteresting
hm
her
curiosity
seemed
at
length
satisfied
she
sank
back
into
the
sofa
and
sipped
her
cocktail
you
a
funny
one
she
commented
thoughtfully
does
everybody
want
to
marry
you
because
your
grandfather
is
rich
they
do
but
i
should
blame
them
if
they
did
still
you
see
i
never
intend
to
marry
she
scorned
this
you
fall
in
love
someday
oh
you
will
i
know
she
nodded
wisely
it
be
idiotic
to
be
overconfident
that
what
ruined
the
chevalier
who
was
he
a
creature
of
my
splendid
mind
he
my
one
creation
the
chevalier
she
murmured
pleasantly
using
the
clumsy
rope
ladder
with
which
she
bridged
all
gaps
and
climbed
after
her
mental
superiors
subconsciously
she
felt
that
it
eliminated
distances
and
brought
the
person
whose
imagination
had
eluded
her
back
within
range
oh
no
objected
anthony
oh
no
geraldine
you
must
play
the
alienist
upon
the
chevalier
if
you
feel
yourself
unable
to
understand
him
i
wo
bring
him
in
besides
i
should
feel
a
certain
uneasiness
because
of
his
regrettable
reputation
i
guess
i
can
understand
anything
that
got
any
sense
to
it
answered
geraldine
a
bit
testily
in
that
case
there
are
various
episodes
in
the
life
of
the
chevalier
which
might
prove
diverting
well
it
was
his
untimely
end
that
caused
me
to
think
of
him
and
made
him
apropos
in
the
conversation
i
hate
to
introduce
him
end
foremost
but
it
seems
inevitable
that
the
chevalier
must
back
into
your
life
well
what
about
him
did
he
die
he
did
in
this
manner
he
was
an
irishman
geraldine
a
irishman
the
wild
sort
with
a
genteel
brogue
and
hair
he
was
exiled
from
erin
in
the
late
days
of
chivalry
and
of
course
crossed
over
to
france
now
the
chevalier
geraldine
had
like
me
one
weakness
he
was
enormously
susceptible
to
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
women
besides
being
a
sentimentalist
he
was
a
romantic
a
vain
fellow
a
man
of
wild
passions
a
little
blind
in
one
eye
and
almost
in
the
other
now
a
male
roaming
the
world
in
this
condition
is
as
helpless
as
a
lion
without
teeth
and
in
consequence
the
chevalier
was
made
utterly
miserable
for
twenty
years
by
a
series
of
women
who
hated
him
used
him
bored
him
aggravated
him
sickened
him
spent
his
money
made
a
fool
of
him
in
brief
as
the
world
has
it
loved
him
this
was
bad
geraldine
and
as
the
chevalier
save
for
this
one
weakness
this
exceeding
susceptibility
was
a
man
of
penetration
he
decided
that
he
would
rescue
himself
once
and
for
all
from
these
drains
upon
him
with
this
purpose
he
went
to
a
very
famous
monastery
in
champagne
called
well
anachronistically
known
as
voltaire
it
was
the
rule
at
voltaire
that
no
monk
could
descend
to
the
ground
story
of
the
monastery
so
long
as
he
lived
but
should
exist
engaged
in
prayer
and
contemplation
in
one
of
the
four
towers
which
were
called
after
the
four
commandments
of
the
monastery
rule
poverty
chastity
obedience
and
silence
when
the
day
came
that
was
to
witness
the
chevalier
farewell
to
the
world
he
was
utterly
happy
he
gave
all
his
greek
books
to
his
landlady
and
his
sword
he
sent
in
a
golden
sheath
to
the
king
of
france
and
all
his
mementos
of
ireland
he
gave
to
the
young
huguenot
who
sold
fish
in
the
street
where
he
lived
then
he
rode
out
to
voltaire
slew
his
horse
at
the
door
and
presented
the
carcass
to
the
monastery
cook
at
five
that
night
he
felt
for
the
first
time
free
forever
free
from
sex
no
woman
could
enter
the
monastery
no
monk
could
descend
below
the
second
story
so
as
he
climbed
the
winding
stair
that
led
to
his
cell
at
the
very
top
of
the
tower
of
chastity
he
paused
for
a
moment
by
an
open
window
which
looked
down
fifty
feet
on
to
a
road
below
it
was
all
so
beautiful
he
thought
this
world
that
he
was
leaving
the
golden
shower
of
sun
beating
down
upon
the
long
fields
the
spray
of
trees
in
the
distance
the
vineyards
quiet
and
green
freshening
wide
miles
before
him
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
window
casement
and
gazed
at
the
winding
road
now
as
it
happened
thérèse
a
peasant
girl
of
sixteen
from
a
neighboring
village
was
at
that
moment
passing
along
this
same
road
that
ran
in
front
of
the
monastery
five
minutes
before
the
little
piece
of
ribbon
which
held
up
the
stocking
on
her
pretty
left
leg
had
worn
through
and
broken
being
a
girl
of
rare
modesty
she
had
thought
to
wait
until
she
arrived
home
before
repairing
it
but
it
had
bothered
her
to
such
an
extent
that
she
felt
she
could
endure
it
no
longer
so
as
she
passed
the
tower
of
chastity
she
stopped
and
with
a
pretty
gesture
lifted
her
skirt
as
little
as
possible
be
it
said
to
her
credit
to
adjust
her
garter
up
in
the
tower
the
newest
arrival
in
the
ancient
monastery
of
voltaire
as
though
pulled
forward
by
a
gigantic
and
irresistible
hand
leaned
from
the
window
further
he
leaned
and
further
until
suddenly
one
of
the
stones
loosened
under
his
weight
broke
from
its
cement
with
a
soft
powdery
sound
and
first
headlong
then
head
over
heels
finally
in
a
vast
and
impressive
revolution
tumbled
the
chevalier
bound
for
the
hard
earth
and
eternal
damnation
thérèse
was
so
much
upset
by
the
occurrence
that
she
ran
all
the
way
home
and
for
ten
years
spent
an
hour
a
day
in
secret
prayer
for
the
soul
of
the
monk
whose
neck
and
vows
were
simultaneously
broken
on
that
unfortunate
sunday
afternoon
and
the
chevalier
being
suspected
of
suicide
was
not
buried
in
consecrated
ground
but
tumbled
into
a
field
near
by
where
he
doubtless
improved
the
quality
of
the
soil
for
many
years
afterward
such
was
the
untimely
end
of
a
very
brave
and
gallant
gentleman
what
do
you
think
geraldine
but
geraldine
lost
long
before
could
only
smile
roguishly
wave
her
first
finger
at
him
and
repeat
her
her
crazy
she
said
you
his
thin
face
was
kindly
she
thought
and
his
eyes
quite
gentle
she
liked
him
because
he
was
arrogant
without
being
conceited
and
because
unlike
the
men
she
met
about
the
theatre
he
had
a
horror
of
being
conspicuous
what
an
odd
pointless
story
but
she
had
enjoyed
the
part
about
the
stocking
after
the
fifth
cocktail
he
kissed
her
and
between
laughter
and
bantering
caresses
and
a
flare
of
passion
they
passed
an
hour
at
she
claimed
an
engagement
and
going
into
the
bathroom
she
rearranged
her
hair
refusing
to
let
him
order
her
a
taxi
she
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
doorway
you
get
married
she
was
insisting
you
wait
and
see
anthony
was
playing
with
an
ancient
tennis
ball
and
he
bounced
it
carefully
on
the
floor
several
times
before
he
answered
with
a
soupçon
of
acidity
you
a
little
idiot
geraldine
she
smiled
provokingly
oh
i
am
am
i
want
to
bet
that
be
silly
too
oh
it
would
would
it
well
i
just
bet
you
marry
somebody
inside
of
a
year
anthony
bounced
the
tennis
ball
very
hard
this
was
one
of
his
handsome
days
she
thought
a
sort
of
intensity
had
displaced
the
melancholy
in
his
dark
eyes
geraldine
he
said
at
length
in
the
first
place
i
have
no
one
i
want
to
marry
in
the
second
place
i
have
enough
money
to
support
two
people
in
the
third
place
i
am
entirely
opposed
to
marriage
for
people
of
my
type
in
the
fourth
place
i
have
a
strong
distaste
for
even
the
abstract
consideration
of
it
but
geraldine
only
narrowed
her
eyes
knowingly
made
her
clicking
sound
and
said
she
must
be
going
it
was
late
call
me
up
soon
she
reminded
him
as
he
kissed
her
goodbye
you
have
for
three
weeks
you
know
i
will
he
promised
fervently
he
shut
the
door
and
coming
back
into
the
room
stood
for
a
moment
lost
in
thought
with
the
tennis
ball
still
clasped
in
his
hand
there
was
one
of
his
lonelinesses
coming
one
of
those
times
when
he
walked
the
streets
or
sat
aimless
and
depressed
biting
a
pencil
at
his
desk
it
was
a
with
no
comfort
a
demand
for
expression
with
no
outlet
a
sense
of
time
rushing
by
ceaselessly
and
wastefully
assuaged
only
by
that
conviction
that
there
was
nothing
to
waste
because
all
efforts
and
attainments
were
equally
valueless
he
thought
with
emotion
aloud
ejaculative
for
he
was
hurt
and
confused
no
of
getting
married
by
of
a
sudden
he
hurled
the
tennis
ball
violently
across
the
room
where
it
barely
missed
the
lamp
and
rebounding
here
and
there
for
a
moment
lay
still
upon
the
floor
signlight
and
moonlight
for
her
dinner
gloria
had
taken
a
table
in
the
cascades
at
the
biltmore
and
when
the
men
met
in
the
hall
outside
a
little
after
eight
that
person
bloeckman
was
the
target
of
six
masculine
eyes
he
was
a
stoutening
ruddy
jew
of
about
with
an
expressive
face
under
smooth
sandy
hair
and
no
doubt
in
most
business
gatherings
his
personality
would
have
been
considered
ingratiating
he
sauntered
up
to
the
three
younger
men
who
stood
in
a
group
smoking
as
they
waited
for
their
hostess
and
introduced
himself
with
a
little
too
evident
assurance
nevertheless
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
he
received
the
intended
impression
of
faint
and
ironic
chill
there
was
no
hint
of
understanding
in
his
manner
you
related
to
adam
j
patch
he
inquired
of
anthony
emitting
two
slender
strings
of
smoke
from
nostrils
overwide
anthony
admitted
it
with
the
ghost
of
a
smile
he
a
fine
man
pronounced
bloeckman
profoundly
he
a
fine
example
of
an
american
yes
agreed
anthony
he
certainly
is
i
detest
these
underdone
men
he
thought
coldly
boiled
looking
ought
to
be
shoved
back
in
the
oven
just
one
more
minute
would
do
it
bloeckman
squinted
at
his
watch
time
these
girls
were
showing
up
anthony
waited
breathlessly
it
came
but
then
with
a
widening
smile
you
know
how
women
are
the
three
young
men
nodded
bloeckman
looked
casually
about
him
his
eyes
resting
critically
on
the
ceiling
and
then
passing
lower
his
expression
combined
that
of
a
middle
western
farmer
appraising
his
wheat
crop
and
that
of
an
actor
wondering
whether
he
is
observed
the
public
manner
of
all
good
americans
as
he
finished
his
survey
he
turned
back
quickly
to
the
reticent
trio
determined
to
strike
to
their
very
heart
and
core
you
college
men
harvard
eh
i
see
the
princeton
boys
beat
you
fellows
in
hockey
unfortunate
man
he
had
drawn
another
blank
they
had
been
three
years
out
and
heeded
only
the
big
football
games
whether
after
the
failure
of
this
sally
bloeckman
would
have
perceived
himself
to
be
in
a
cynical
atmosphere
is
problematical
for
gloria
arrived
muriel
arrived
rachael
arrived
after
a
hurried
hello
people
uttered
by
gloria
and
echoed
by
the
other
two
the
three
swept
by
into
the
dressing
room
a
moment
later
muriel
appeared
in
a
state
of
elaborate
undress
and
toward
them
she
was
in
her
element
her
ebony
hair
was
slicked
straight
back
on
her
head
her
eyes
were
artificially
darkened
she
reeked
of
insistent
perfume
she
was
got
up
to
the
best
of
her
ability
as
a
siren
more
popularly
a
vamp
a
picker
up
and
thrower
away
of
men
an
unscrupulous
and
fundamentally
unmoved
toyer
with
affections
something
in
the
exhaustiveness
of
her
attempt
fascinated
maury
at
first
sight
a
woman
with
wide
hips
affecting
a
litheness
as
they
waited
the
extra
three
minutes
for
gloria
and
by
polite
assumption
for
rachael
he
was
unable
to
take
his
eyes
from
her
she
would
turn
her
head
away
lowering
her
eyelashes
and
biting
her
nether
lip
in
an
amazing
exhibition
of
coyness
she
would
rest
her
hands
on
her
hips
and
sway
from
side
to
side
in
tune
to
the
music
saying
did
you
ever
hear
such
perfect
ragtime
i
just
ca
make
my
shoulders
behave
when
i
hear
that
bloeckman
clapped
his
hands
gallantly
you
ought
to
be
on
the
stage
i
like
to
be
cried
muriel
will
you
back
me
i
sure
will
with
becoming
modesty
muriel
ceased
her
motions
and
turned
to
maury
asking
what
he
had
seen
this
year
he
interpreted
this
as
referring
to
the
dramatic
world
and
they
had
a
gay
and
exhilarating
exchange
of
titles
after
this
manner
muriel
have
you
seen
peg
o
my
heart
maury
no
i
have
muriel
it
wonderful
you
want
to
see
it
maury
have
you
seen
omar
the
tentmaker
muriel
no
but
i
hear
it
wonderful
i
very
anxious
to
see
it
have
you
seen
fair
and
warmer
maury
yes
muriel
i
do
think
it
very
good
it
trashy
maury
yes
that
true
muriel
but
i
went
to
within
the
law
last
night
and
i
thought
it
was
fine
have
you
seen
the
little
cafe
this
continued
until
they
ran
out
of
plays
dick
meanwhile
turned
to
bloeckman
determined
to
extract
what
gold
he
could
from
this
unpromising
load
i
hear
all
the
new
novels
are
sold
to
the
moving
pictures
as
soon
as
they
come
out
that
true
of
course
the
main
thing
in
a
moving
picture
is
a
strong
story
yes
i
suppose
so
so
many
novels
are
all
full
of
talk
and
psychology
of
course
those
are
as
valuable
to
us
it
impossible
to
make
much
of
that
interesting
on
the
screen
you
want
plots
first
said
richard
brilliantly
of
course
plots
first
he
paused
shifted
his
gaze
his
pause
spread
included
the
others
with
all
the
authority
of
a
warning
finger
gloria
followed
by
rachael
was
coming
out
of
the
dressing
room
among
other
things
it
developed
during
dinner
that
joseph
bloeckman
never
danced
but
spent
the
music
time
watching
the
others
with
the
bored
tolerance
of
an
elder
among
children
he
was
a
dignified
man
and
a
proud
one
born
in
munich
he
had
begun
his
american
career
as
a
peanut
vender
with
a
travelling
circus
at
eighteen
he
was
a
side
show
ballyhoo
later
the
manager
of
the
side
show
and
soon
after
the
proprietor
of
a
vaudeville
house
just
when
the
moving
picture
had
passed
out
of
the
stage
of
a
curiosity
and
become
a
promising
industry
he
was
an
ambitious
young
man
of
with
some
money
to
invest
nagging
financial
ambitions
and
a
good
working
knowledge
of
the
popular
show
business
that
had
been
nine
years
before
the
moving
picture
industry
had
borne
him
up
with
it
where
it
threw
off
dozens
of
men
with
more
financial
ability
more
imagination
and
more
practical
ideas
and
now
he
sat
here
and
contemplated
the
immortal
gloria
for
whom
young
stuart
holcome
had
gone
from
new
york
to
pasadena
watched
her
and
knew
that
presently
she
would
cease
dancing
and
come
back
to
sit
on
his
left
hand
he
hoped
she
would
hurry
the
oysters
had
been
standing
some
minutes
meanwhile
anthony
who
had
been
placed
on
gloria
left
hand
was
dancing
with
her
always
in
a
certain
fourth
of
the
floor
this
had
there
been
stags
would
have
been
a
delicate
tribute
to
the
girl
meaning
damn
you
do
cut
in
it
was
very
consciously
intimate
well
he
began
looking
down
at
her
you
look
mighty
sweet
she
met
his
eyes
over
the
horizontal
half
foot
that
separated
them
thank
you
anthony
in
fact
you
uncomfortably
beautiful
he
added
there
was
no
smile
this
time
and
you
very
charming
is
this
nice
he
laughed
we
actually
approve
of
each
other
do
you
usually
she
had
caught
quickly
at
his
remark
as
she
always
did
at
any
unexplained
allusion
to
herself
however
faint
he
lowered
his
voice
and
when
he
spoke
there
was
in
it
no
more
than
a
wisp
of
badinage
does
a
priest
approve
the
pope
i
do
know
but
that
probably
the
vaguest
compliment
i
ever
received
perhaps
i
can
muster
a
few
bromides
well
i
would
have
you
strain
yourself
look
at
muriel
right
here
next
to
us
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
muriel
was
resting
her
brilliant
cheek
against
the
lapel
of
maury
noble
dinner
coat
and
her
powdered
left
arm
was
apparently
twisted
around
his
head
one
was
impelled
to
wonder
why
she
failed
to
seize
the
nape
of
his
neck
with
her
hand
her
eyes
turned
rolled
largely
back
and
forth
her
hips
swayed
and
as
she
danced
she
kept
up
a
constant
low
singing
this
at
first
seemed
to
be
a
translation
of
the
song
into
some
foreign
tongue
but
became
eventually
apparent
as
an
attempt
to
fill
out
the
metre
of
the
song
with
the
only
words
she
knew
the
words
of
the
title
he
a
a
a
picking
man
picking
pick
pick
pick
pick
and
so
on
into
phrases
still
more
strange
and
barbaric
when
she
caught
the
amused
glances
of
anthony
and
gloria
she
acknowledged
them
only
with
a
faint
smile
and
a
of
her
eyes
to
indicate
that
the
music
entering
into
her
soul
had
put
her
into
an
ecstatic
and
exceedingly
seductive
trance
the
music
ended
and
they
returned
to
their
table
whose
solitary
but
dignified
occupant
arose
and
tendered
each
of
them
a
smile
so
ingratiating
that
it
was
as
if
he
were
shaking
their
hands
and
congratulating
them
on
a
brilliant
performance
blockhead
never
will
dance
i
think
he
has
a
wooden
leg
remarked
gloria
to
the
table
at
large
the
three
young
men
started
and
the
gentleman
referred
to
winced
perceptibly
this
was
the
one
rough
spot
in
the
course
of
bloeckman
acquaintance
with
gloria
she
relentlessly
punned
on
his
name
first
it
had
been
lately
the
more
invidious
blockhead
he
had
requested
with
a
strong
undertone
of
irony
that
she
use
his
first
name
and
this
she
had
done
obediently
several
times
then
slipping
helpless
repentant
but
dissolved
in
laughter
back
into
blockhead
it
was
a
very
sad
and
thoughtless
thing
i
afraid
bloeckman
thinks
we
a
frivolous
crowd
sighed
muriel
waving
a
balanced
oyster
in
his
direction
he
has
that
air
murmured
rachael
anthony
tried
to
remember
whether
she
had
said
anything
before
he
thought
not
it
was
her
initial
remark
bloeckman
suddenly
cleared
his
throat
and
said
in
a
loud
distinct
voice
on
the
contrary
when
a
man
speaks
he
merely
tradition
he
has
at
best
a
few
thousand
years
back
of
him
but
woman
why
she
is
the
miraculous
mouthpiece
of
posterity
in
the
stunned
pause
that
followed
this
astounding
remark
anthony
choked
suddenly
on
an
oyster
and
hurried
his
napkin
to
his
face
rachael
and
muriel
raised
a
mild
if
somewhat
surprised
laugh
in
which
dick
and
maury
joined
both
of
them
red
in
the
face
and
restraining
uproariousness
with
the
most
apparent
my
god
thought
anthony
it
a
subtitle
from
one
of
his
movies
the
man
memorized
it
gloria
alone
made
no
sound
she
fixed
bloeckman
with
a
glance
of
silent
reproach
well
for
the
love
of
heaven
where
on
earth
did
you
dig
that
up
bloeckman
looked
at
her
uncertainly
not
sure
of
her
intention
but
in
a
moment
he
recovered
his
poise
and
assumed
the
bland
and
consciously
tolerant
smile
of
an
intellectual
among
spoiled
and
callow
youth
the
soup
came
up
from
the
kitchen
but
simultaneously
the
orchestra
leader
came
up
from
the
bar
where
he
had
absorbed
the
tone
color
inherent
in
a
seidel
of
beer
so
the
soup
was
left
to
cool
during
the
delivery
of
a
ballad
entitled
everything
at
home
except
your
wife
then
the
champagne
and
the
party
assumed
more
amusing
proportions
the
men
except
richard
caramel
drank
freely
gloria
and
muriel
sipped
a
glass
apiece
rachael
jerryl
took
none
they
sat
out
the
waltzes
but
danced
to
everything
else
all
except
gloria
who
seemed
to
tire
after
a
while
and
preferred
to
sit
smoking
at
the
table
her
eyes
now
lazy
now
eager
according
to
whether
she
listened
to
bloeckman
or
watched
a
pretty
woman
among
the
dancers
several
times
anthony
wondered
what
bloeckman
was
telling
her
he
was
chewing
a
cigar
back
and
forth
in
his
mouth
and
had
expanded
after
dinner
to
the
extent
of
violent
gestures
ten
found
gloria
and
anthony
beginning
a
dance
just
as
they
were
out
of
of
the
table
she
said
in
a
low
voice
dance
over
by
the
door
i
want
to
go
down
to
the
obediently
anthony
guided
her
through
the
crowd
in
the
designated
direction
in
the
hall
she
left
him
for
a
moment
to
reappear
with
a
cloak
over
her
arm
i
want
some
she
said
humorously
apologetic
you
guess
what
for
this
time
it
just
that
i
want
to
bite
my
and
i
will
if
i
do
get
some
she
sighed
and
resumed
as
they
stepped
into
the
empty
elevator
i
been
biting
all
day
a
bit
nervous
you
see
excuse
the
pun
it
was
unintentional
the
words
just
arranged
themselves
gloria
gilbert
the
female
wag
reaching
the
ground
floor
they
naïvely
avoided
the
hotel
candy
counter
descended
the
wide
front
staircase
and
walking
through
several
corridors
found
a
in
the
grand
central
station
after
an
intense
examination
of
the
perfume
counter
she
made
her
purchase
then
on
some
mutual
unmentioned
impulse
they
strolled
arm
in
arm
not
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
but
out
into
street
the
night
was
alive
with
thaw
it
was
so
nearly
warm
that
a
breeze
drifting
low
along
the
sidewalk
brought
to
anthony
a
vision
of
an
hyacinthine
spring
above
in
the
blue
oblong
of
sky
around
them
in
the
caress
of
the
drifting
air
the
illusion
of
a
new
season
carried
relief
from
the
stiff
and
atmosphere
they
had
left
and
for
a
hushed
moment
the
traffic
sounds
and
the
murmur
of
water
flowing
in
the
gutters
seemed
an
illusive
and
rarefied
prolongation
of
that
music
to
which
they
had
lately
danced
when
anthony
spoke
it
was
with
surety
that
his
words
came
from
something
breathless
and
desirous
that
the
night
had
conceived
in
their
two
hearts
let
take
a
taxi
and
ride
around
a
bit
he
suggested
without
looking
at
her
oh
gloria
gloria
a
cab
yawned
at
the
curb
as
it
moved
off
like
a
boat
on
a
labyrinthine
ocean
and
lost
itself
among
the
inchoate
night
masses
of
the
great
buildings
among
the
now
stilled
now
strident
cries
and
clangings
anthony
put
his
arm
around
the
girl
drew
her
over
to
him
and
kissed
her
damp
childish
mouth
she
was
silent
she
turned
her
face
up
to
him
pale
under
the
wisps
and
patches
of
light
that
trailed
in
like
moonshine
through
a
foliage
her
eyes
were
gleaming
ripples
in
the
white
lake
of
her
face
the
shadows
of
her
hair
bordered
the
brow
with
a
persuasive
unintimate
dusk
no
love
was
there
surely
nor
the
imprint
of
any
love
her
beauty
was
cool
as
this
damp
breeze
as
the
moist
softness
of
her
own
lips
you
such
a
swan
in
this
light
he
whispered
after
a
moment
there
were
silences
as
murmurous
as
sound
there
were
pauses
that
seemed
about
to
shatter
and
were
only
to
be
snatched
back
to
oblivion
by
the
tightening
of
his
arms
about
her
and
the
sense
that
she
was
resting
there
as
a
caught
gossamer
feather
drifted
in
out
of
the
dark
anthony
laughed
noiselessly
and
exultantly
turning
his
face
up
and
away
from
her
half
in
an
overpowering
rush
of
triumph
half
lest
her
sight
of
him
should
spoil
the
splendid
immobility
of
her
expression
such
a
kiss
it
was
a
flower
held
against
the
face
never
to
be
described
scarcely
to
be
remembered
as
though
her
beauty
were
giving
off
emanations
of
itself
which
settled
transiently
and
already
dissolving
upon
his
heart
the
buildings
fell
away
in
melted
shadows
this
was
the
park
now
and
after
a
long
while
the
great
white
ghost
of
the
metropolitan
museum
moved
majestically
past
echoing
sonorously
to
the
rush
of
the
cab
why
gloria
why
gloria
her
eyes
appeared
to
regard
him
out
of
many
thousand
years
all
emotion
she
might
have
felt
all
words
she
might
have
uttered
would
have
seemed
inadequate
beside
the
adequacy
of
her
silence
ineloquent
against
the
eloquence
of
her
beauty
and
of
her
body
close
to
him
slender
and
cool
tell
him
to
turn
around
she
murmured
and
drive
pretty
fast
going
back
up
in
the
supper
room
the
air
was
hot
the
table
littered
with
napkins
and
was
old
and
stale
it
was
between
dances
as
they
entered
and
muriel
kane
looked
up
with
roguishness
extraordinary
well
where
have
been
to
call
up
mother
answered
gloria
coolly
i
promised
her
i
would
did
we
miss
a
dance
then
followed
an
incident
that
though
slight
in
itself
anthony
had
cause
to
reflect
on
many
years
afterward
joseph
bloeckman
leaning
well
back
in
his
chair
fixed
him
with
a
peculiar
glance
in
which
several
emotions
were
curiously
and
inextricably
mingled
he
did
not
greet
gloria
except
by
rising
and
he
immediately
resumed
a
conversation
with
richard
caramel
about
the
influence
of
literature
on
the
moving
pictures
magic
the
stark
and
unexpected
miracle
of
a
night
fades
out
with
the
lingering
death
of
the
last
stars
and
the
premature
birth
of
the
first
newsboys
the
flame
retreats
to
some
remote
and
platonic
fire
the
white
heat
has
gone
from
the
iron
and
the
glow
from
the
coal
along
the
shelves
of
anthony
library
filling
a
wall
amply
crept
a
chill
and
insolent
pencil
of
sunlight
touching
with
frigid
disapproval
thérèse
of
france
and
ann
the
superwoman
jenny
of
the
orient
ballet
and
zuleika
the
conjurer
and
hoosier
cora
then
down
a
shelf
and
into
the
years
resting
pityingly
on
the
shades
of
helen
thaïs
salome
and
cleopatra
anthony
shaved
and
bathed
sat
in
his
most
deeply
cushioned
chair
and
watched
it
until
at
the
steady
rising
of
the
sun
it
lay
glinting
for
a
moment
on
the
silk
ends
of
the
rug
and
went
out
it
was
ten
the
sunday
times
scattered
about
his
feet
proclaimed
by
rotogravure
and
editorial
by
social
revelation
and
sporting
sheet
that
the
world
had
been
tremendously
engrossed
during
the
past
week
in
the
business
of
moving
toward
some
splendid
if
somewhat
indeterminate
goal
for
his
part
anthony
had
been
once
to
his
grandfather
twice
to
his
broker
and
three
times
to
his
tailor
and
in
the
last
hour
of
the
week
last
day
he
had
kissed
a
very
beautiful
and
charming
girl
when
he
reached
home
his
imagination
had
been
teeming
with
high
pitched
unfamiliar
dreams
there
was
suddenly
no
question
on
his
mind
no
eternal
problem
for
a
solution
and
resolution
he
had
experienced
an
emotion
that
was
neither
mental
nor
physical
nor
merely
a
mixture
of
the
two
and
the
love
of
life
absorbed
him
for
the
present
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
he
was
content
to
let
the
experiment
remain
isolated
and
unique
almost
impersonally
he
was
convinced
that
no
woman
he
had
ever
met
compared
in
any
way
with
gloria
she
was
deeply
herself
she
was
immeasurably
sincere
of
these
things
he
was
certain
beside
her
the
two
dozen
schoolgirls
and
debutantes
young
married
women
and
waifs
and
strays
whom
he
had
known
were
so
many
females
in
the
word
most
contemptuous
sense
breeders
and
bearers
exuding
still
that
faintly
odorous
atmosphere
of
the
cave
and
the
nursery
so
far
as
he
could
see
she
had
neither
submitted
to
any
will
of
his
nor
caressed
his
vanity
except
as
her
pleasure
in
his
company
was
a
caress
indeed
he
had
no
reason
for
thinking
she
had
given
him
aught
that
she
did
not
give
to
others
this
was
as
it
should
be
the
idea
of
an
entanglement
growing
out
of
the
evening
was
as
remote
as
it
would
have
been
repugnant
and
she
had
disclaimed
and
buried
the
incident
with
a
decisive
untruth
here
were
two
young
people
with
fancy
enough
to
distinguish
a
game
from
its
reality
who
by
the
very
casualness
with
which
they
met
and
passed
on
would
proclaim
themselves
unharmed
having
decided
this
he
went
to
the
phone
and
called
up
the
plaza
hotel
gloria
was
out
her
mother
knew
neither
where
she
had
gone
nor
when
she
would
return
it
was
somehow
at
this
point
that
the
first
wrongness
in
the
case
asserted
itself
there
was
an
element
of
callousness
almost
of
indecency
in
gloria
absence
from
home
he
suspected
that
by
going
out
she
had
intrigued
him
into
a
disadvantage
returning
she
would
find
his
name
and
smile
most
discreetly
he
should
have
waited
a
few
hours
in
order
to
drive
home
the
utter
inconsequence
with
which
he
regarded
the
incident
what
an
asinine
blunder
she
would
think
he
considered
himself
particularly
favored
she
would
think
he
was
reacting
with
the
most
inept
intimacy
to
a
quite
trivial
episode
he
remembered
that
during
the
previous
month
his
janitor
to
whom
he
had
delivered
a
rather
muddled
lecture
on
the
man
had
come
up
next
day
and
on
the
basis
of
what
had
happened
the
night
before
seated
himself
in
the
window
seat
for
a
cordial
and
chatty
anthony
wondered
in
horror
if
gloria
would
regard
him
as
he
had
regarded
that
man
him
anthony
patch
horror
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
a
passive
thing
acted
upon
by
an
influence
above
and
beyond
gloria
that
he
was
merely
the
sensitive
plate
on
which
the
photograph
was
made
some
gargantuan
photographer
had
focussed
the
camera
on
gloria
and
the
poor
plate
could
but
develop
confined
like
all
things
to
its
nature
but
anthony
lying
upon
his
couch
and
staring
at
the
orange
lamp
passed
his
thin
fingers
incessantly
through
his
dark
hair
and
made
new
symbols
for
the
hours
she
was
in
a
shop
now
it
seemed
moving
lithely
among
the
velvets
and
the
furs
her
own
dress
making
as
she
walked
a
debonair
rustle
in
that
world
of
silken
rustles
and
cool
soprano
laughter
and
scents
of
many
slain
but
living
flowers
the
minnies
and
pearls
and
jewels
and
jennies
would
gather
round
her
like
courtiers
bearing
wispy
frailties
of
georgette
crepe
delicate
chiffon
to
echo
her
cheeks
in
faint
pastel
milky
lace
to
rest
in
pale
disarray
against
her
neck
damask
was
used
but
to
cover
priests
and
divans
in
these
days
and
cloth
of
samarand
was
remembered
only
by
the
romantic
poets
she
would
go
elsewhere
after
a
while
tilting
her
head
a
hundred
ways
under
a
hundred
bonnets
seeking
in
vain
for
mock
cherries
to
match
her
lips
or
plumes
that
were
graceful
as
her
own
supple
body
noon
would
come
she
would
hurry
along
fifth
avenue
a
nordic
ganymede
her
fur
coat
swinging
fashionably
with
her
steps
her
cheeks
redder
by
a
stroke
of
the
wind
brush
her
breath
a
delightful
mist
upon
the
bracing
air
and
the
doors
of
the
ritz
would
revolve
the
crowd
would
divide
fifty
masculine
eyes
would
start
stare
as
she
gave
back
forgotten
dreams
to
the
husbands
of
many
obese
and
comic
women
one
with
her
fork
she
would
tantalize
the
heart
of
an
adoring
artichoke
while
her
escort
served
himself
up
in
the
thick
dripping
sentences
of
an
enraptured
man
four
her
little
feet
moving
to
melody
her
face
distinct
in
the
crowd
her
partner
happy
as
a
petted
puppy
and
mad
as
the
immemorial
hatter
then
then
night
would
come
drifting
down
and
perhaps
another
damp
the
signs
would
spill
their
light
into
the
street
who
knew
no
wiser
than
he
they
haply
sought
to
recapture
that
picture
done
in
cream
and
shadow
they
had
seen
on
the
hushed
avenue
the
night
before
and
they
might
ah
they
might
a
thousand
taxis
would
yawn
at
a
thousand
corners
and
only
to
him
was
that
kiss
forever
lost
and
done
in
a
thousand
guises
thaïs
would
hail
a
cab
and
turn
up
her
face
for
loving
and
her
pallor
would
be
virginal
and
lovely
and
her
kiss
chaste
as
the
moon
he
sprang
excitedly
to
his
feet
how
inappropriate
that
she
should
be
out
he
had
realized
at
last
what
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
again
to
find
rest
in
her
great
immobility
she
was
the
end
of
all
restlessness
all
malcontent
anthony
dressed
and
went
out
as
he
should
have
done
long
before
and
down
to
richard
caramel
room
to
hear
the
last
revision
of
the
last
chapter
of
the
demon
lover
he
did
not
call
gloria
again
until
six
he
did
not
find
her
in
until
eight
and
oh
climax
of
anticlimaxes
she
could
give
him
no
engagement
until
tuesday
afternoon
a
broken
piece
of
clattered
to
the
floor
as
he
banged
up
the
phone
black
magic
tuesday
was
freezing
cold
he
called
at
a
bleak
two
and
as
they
shook
hands
he
wondered
confusedly
whether
he
had
ever
kissed
her
it
was
almost
unbelievable
he
seriously
doubted
if
she
remembered
it
i
called
you
four
times
on
sunday
he
told
her
did
you
there
was
surprise
in
her
voice
and
interest
in
her
expression
silently
he
cursed
himself
for
having
told
her
he
might
have
known
her
pride
did
not
deal
in
such
petty
triumphs
even
then
he
had
not
guessed
at
the
truth
that
never
having
had
to
worry
about
men
she
had
seldom
used
the
wary
subterfuges
the
playings
out
and
haulings
in
that
were
the
stock
in
trade
of
her
sisterhood
when
she
liked
a
man
that
was
trick
enough
did
she
think
she
loved
him
there
was
an
ultimate
and
fatal
thrust
her
charm
endlessly
preserved
itself
i
was
anxious
to
see
you
he
said
simply
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
mean
really
talk
somewhere
where
we
can
be
alone
may
i
what
do
you
mean
he
swallowed
a
sudden
lump
of
panic
he
felt
that
she
knew
what
he
wanted
i
mean
not
at
a
tea
table
he
said
well
all
right
but
not
i
want
to
get
some
exercise
walk
it
was
bitter
and
raw
all
the
evil
hate
in
the
mad
heart
of
february
was
wrought
into
the
forlorn
and
icy
wind
that
cut
its
way
cruelly
across
central
park
and
down
along
fifth
avenue
it
was
almost
impossible
to
talk
and
discomfort
made
him
distracted
so
much
so
that
he
turned
at
street
to
find
that
she
was
no
longer
beside
him
he
looked
around
she
was
forty
feet
in
the
rear
standing
motionless
her
face
half
hidden
in
her
fur
coat
collar
moved
either
by
anger
or
laughter
he
could
not
determine
which
he
started
back
do
let
me
interrupt
your
walk
she
called
i
mighty
sorry
he
answered
in
confusion
did
i
go
too
fast
i
cold
she
announced
i
want
to
go
home
and
you
walk
too
fast
i
very
sorry
side
by
side
they
started
for
the
plaza
he
wished
he
could
see
her
face
men
do
usually
get
so
absorbed
in
themselves
when
they
with
me
i
sorry
that
very
interesting
it
rather
too
cold
to
walk
he
said
briskly
to
hide
his
annoyance
she
made
no
answer
and
he
wondered
if
she
would
dismiss
him
at
the
hotel
entrance
she
walked
in
without
speaking
however
and
to
the
elevator
throwing
him
a
single
remark
as
she
entered
it
you
better
come
up
he
hesitated
for
the
fraction
of
a
moment
perhaps
i
better
call
some
other
time
just
as
you
say
her
words
were
murmured
as
an
aside
the
main
concern
of
life
was
the
adjusting
of
some
stray
wisps
of
hair
in
the
elevator
mirror
her
cheeks
were
brilliant
her
eyes
sparkled
she
had
never
seemed
so
lovely
so
exquisitely
to
be
desired
despising
himself
he
found
that
he
was
walking
down
the
corridor
a
subservient
foot
behind
her
was
in
the
sitting
room
while
she
disappeared
to
shed
her
furs
something
had
gone
wrong
in
his
own
eyes
he
had
lost
a
shred
of
dignity
in
an
unpremeditated
yet
significant
encounter
he
had
been
completely
defeated
however
by
the
time
she
reappeared
in
the
he
had
explained
himself
to
himself
with
sophistic
satisfaction
after
all
he
had
done
the
strongest
thing
he
thought
he
had
wanted
to
come
up
he
had
come
yet
what
happened
later
on
that
afternoon
must
be
traced
to
the
indignity
he
had
experienced
in
the
elevator
the
girl
was
worrying
him
intolerably
so
much
so
that
when
she
came
out
he
involuntarily
drifted
into
criticism
who
this
bloeckman
gloria
a
business
friend
of
father
odd
sort
of
fellow
he
does
like
you
either
she
said
with
a
sudden
smile
anthony
laughed
i
flattered
at
his
notice
he
evidently
considers
me
a
he
broke
off
with
is
he
in
love
with
you
i
do
know
the
deuce
you
do
he
insisted
of
course
he
is
i
remember
the
look
he
gave
me
when
we
got
back
to
the
table
he
probably
have
had
me
quietly
assaulted
by
a
delegation
of
movie
supes
if
you
had
invented
that
phone
call
he
did
mind
i
told
him
afterward
what
really
happened
you
told
him
he
asked
me
i
do
like
that
very
well
he
remonstrated
she
laughed
again
oh
you
do
what
business
is
it
of
his
none
that
why
i
told
him
anthony
in
a
turmoil
bit
savagely
at
his
mouth
why
should
i
lie
she
demanded
directly
i
not
ashamed
of
anything
i
do
it
happened
to
interest
him
to
know
that
i
kissed
you
and
i
happened
to
be
in
a
good
humor
so
i
satisfied
his
curiosity
by
a
simple
and
precise
being
rather
a
sensible
man
after
his
fashion
he
dropped
the
subject
except
to
say
that
he
hated
me
oh
it
worries
you
well
if
you
must
probe
this
stupendous
matter
to
its
depths
he
did
say
he
hated
you
i
simply
know
he
does
it
does
wor
oh
let
drop
it
she
cried
spiritedly
it
a
most
uninteresting
matter
to
me
with
a
tremendous
effort
anthony
made
his
acquiescence
a
twist
of
subject
and
they
drifted
into
an
ancient
game
concerned
with
each
other
pasts
gradually
warming
as
they
discovered
the
immemorial
resemblances
in
tastes
and
ideas
they
said
things
that
were
more
revealing
than
they
intended
but
each
pretended
to
accept
the
other
at
face
or
rather
word
value
the
growth
of
intimacy
is
like
that
first
one
gives
off
his
best
picture
the
bright
and
finished
product
mended
with
bluff
and
falsehood
and
humor
then
more
details
are
required
and
one
paints
a
second
portrait
and
a
third
before
long
the
best
lines
cancel
out
and
the
secret
is
exposed
at
last
the
planes
of
the
pictures
have
intermingled
and
given
us
away
and
though
we
paint
and
paint
we
can
no
longer
sell
a
picture
we
must
be
satisfied
with
hoping
that
such
fatuous
accounts
of
ourselves
as
we
make
to
our
wives
and
children
and
business
associates
are
accepted
as
true
it
seems
to
me
anthony
was
saying
earnestly
that
the
position
of
a
man
with
neither
necessity
nor
ambition
is
unfortunate
heaven
knows
it
be
pathetic
of
me
to
be
sorry
for
myself
yet
sometimes
i
envy
dick
her
silence
was
encouragement
it
was
as
near
as
she
ever
came
to
an
intentional
and
there
used
to
be
dignified
occupations
for
a
gentleman
who
had
leisure
things
a
little
more
constructive
than
filling
up
the
landscape
with
smoke
or
juggling
some
one
else
money
there
science
of
course
sometimes
i
wish
i
taken
a
good
foundation
say
at
boston
tech
but
now
by
golly
i
have
to
sit
down
for
two
years
and
struggle
through
the
fundamentals
of
physics
and
chemistry
she
yawned
i
told
you
i
do
know
what
anybody
ought
to
do
she
said
ungraciously
and
at
her
indifference
his
rancor
was
born
again
are
you
interested
in
anything
except
yourself
not
much
he
glared
his
growing
enjoyment
in
the
conversation
was
ripped
to
shreds
she
had
been
irritable
and
vindictive
all
day
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
for
this
moment
he
hated
her
hard
selfishness
he
stared
morosely
at
the
fire
then
a
strange
thing
happened
she
turned
to
him
and
smiled
and
as
he
saw
her
smile
every
rag
of
anger
and
hurt
vanity
dropped
from
him
as
though
his
very
moods
were
but
the
outer
ripples
of
her
own
as
though
emotion
rose
no
longer
in
his
breast
unless
she
saw
fit
to
pull
an
omnipotent
controlling
thread
he
moved
closer
and
taking
her
hand
pulled
her
ever
so
gently
toward
him
until
she
half
lay
against
his
shoulder
she
smiled
up
at
him
as
he
kissed
her
gloria
he
whispered
very
softly
again
she
had
made
a
magic
subtle
and
pervading
as
a
spilt
perfume
irresistible
and
sweet
afterward
neither
the
next
day
nor
after
many
years
could
he
remember
the
important
things
of
that
afternoon
had
she
been
moved
in
his
arms
had
she
spoken
a
little
or
at
all
what
measure
of
enjoyment
had
she
taken
in
his
kisses
and
had
she
at
any
time
lost
herself
ever
so
little
oh
for
him
there
was
no
doubt
he
had
risen
and
paced
the
floor
in
sheer
ecstasy
that
such
a
girl
should
be
should
poise
curled
in
a
corner
of
the
couch
like
a
swallow
newly
landed
from
a
clean
swift
flight
watching
him
with
inscrutable
eyes
he
would
stop
his
pacing
and
half
shy
each
time
at
first
drop
his
arm
around
her
and
find
her
kiss
she
was
fascinating
he
told
her
he
had
never
met
any
one
like
her
before
he
besought
her
jauntily
but
earnestly
to
send
him
away
he
did
want
to
fall
in
love
he
was
coming
to
see
her
any
more
already
she
had
haunted
too
many
of
his
ways
what
delicious
romance
his
true
reaction
was
neither
fear
nor
sorrow
only
this
deep
delight
in
being
with
her
that
colored
the
banality
of
his
words
and
made
the
mawkish
seem
sad
and
the
posturing
seem
wise
he
come
back
eternally
he
should
have
known
this
is
all
it
been
very
rare
to
have
known
you
very
strange
and
wonderful
but
this
would
do
and
would
last
as
he
spoke
there
was
in
his
heart
that
tremulousness
that
we
take
for
sincerity
in
ourselves
afterward
he
remembered
one
reply
of
hers
to
something
he
had
asked
her
he
remembered
it
in
this
form
perhaps
he
had
unconsciously
arranged
and
polished
it
a
woman
should
be
able
to
kiss
a
man
beautifully
and
romantically
without
any
desire
to
be
either
his
wife
or
his
mistress
as
always
when
he
was
with
her
she
seemed
to
grow
gradually
older
until
at
the
end
ruminations
too
deep
for
words
would
be
wintering
in
her
eyes
an
hour
passed
and
the
fire
leaped
up
in
little
ecstasies
as
though
its
fading
life
was
sweet
it
was
five
now
and
the
clock
over
the
mantel
became
articulate
in
sound
then
as
if
a
brutish
sensibility
in
him
was
reminded
by
those
thin
tinny
beats
that
the
petals
were
falling
from
the
flowered
afternoon
anthony
pulled
her
quickly
to
her
feet
and
held
her
helpless
without
breath
in
a
kiss
that
was
neither
a
game
nor
a
tribute
her
arms
fell
to
her
side
in
an
instant
she
was
free
do
she
said
quietly
i
do
want
that
she
sat
down
on
the
far
side
of
the
lounge
and
gazed
straight
before
her
a
frown
had
gathered
between
her
eyes
anthony
sank
down
beside
her
and
closed
his
hand
over
hers
it
was
lifeless
and
unresponsive
why
gloria
he
made
a
motion
as
if
to
put
his
arm
about
her
but
she
drew
away
i
do
want
that
she
repeated
i
very
sorry
he
said
a
little
impatiently
i
i
did
know
you
made
such
fine
distinctions
she
did
not
answer
wo
you
kiss
me
gloria
i
do
want
to
it
seemed
to
him
she
had
not
moved
for
hours
a
sudden
change
is
it
annoyance
was
growing
in
his
voice
is
it
she
appeared
uninterested
it
was
almost
as
though
she
were
looking
at
some
one
else
perhaps
i
better
go
no
reply
he
rose
and
regarded
her
angrily
uncertainly
again
he
sat
down
gloria
gloria
wo
you
kiss
me
no
her
lips
parting
for
the
word
had
just
faintly
stirred
again
he
got
to
his
feet
this
time
with
less
decision
less
confidence
then
i
go
silence
all
right
i
go
he
was
aware
of
a
certain
irremediable
lack
of
originality
in
his
remarks
indeed
he
felt
that
the
whole
atmosphere
had
grown
oppressive
he
wished
she
would
speak
rail
at
him
cry
out
upon
him
anything
but
this
pervasive
and
chilling
silence
he
cursed
himself
for
a
weak
fool
his
clearest
desire
was
to
move
her
to
hurt
her
to
see
her
wince
helplessly
involuntarily
he
erred
again
if
you
tired
of
kissing
me
i
better
go
he
saw
her
lips
curl
slightly
and
his
last
dignity
left
him
she
spoke
at
length
i
believe
you
made
that
remark
several
times
before
he
looked
about
him
immediately
saw
his
hat
and
coat
on
a
chair
blundered
into
them
during
an
intolerable
moment
looking
again
at
the
couch
he
perceived
that
she
had
not
turned
not
even
moved
with
a
shaken
immediately
regretted
he
went
quickly
but
without
dignity
from
the
room
for
over
a
moment
gloria
made
no
sound
her
lips
were
still
curled
her
glance
was
straight
proud
remote
then
her
eyes
blurred
a
little
and
she
murmured
three
words
half
aloud
to
the
fire
you
ass
she
said
panic
the
man
had
had
the
hardest
blow
of
his
life
he
knew
at
last
what
he
wanted
but
in
finding
it
out
it
seemed
that
he
had
put
it
forever
beyond
his
grasp
he
reached
home
in
misery
dropped
into
an
armchair
without
even
removing
his
overcoat
and
sat
there
for
over
an
hour
his
mind
racing
the
paths
of
fruitless
and
wretched
she
had
sent
him
away
that
was
the
reiterated
burden
of
his
despair
instead
of
seizing
the
girl
and
holding
her
by
sheer
strength
until
she
became
passive
to
his
desire
instead
of
beating
down
her
will
by
the
force
of
his
own
he
had
walked
defeated
and
powerless
from
her
door
with
the
corners
of
his
mouth
drooping
and
what
force
there
might
have
been
in
his
grief
and
rage
hidden
behind
the
manner
of
a
whipped
schoolboy
at
one
minute
she
had
liked
him
tremendously
ah
she
had
nearly
loved
him
in
the
next
he
had
become
a
thing
of
indifference
to
her
an
insolent
and
efficiently
humiliated
man
he
had
no
great
some
of
course
but
there
were
other
things
dominant
in
him
now
far
more
urgent
he
was
not
so
much
in
love
with
gloria
as
mad
for
her
unless
he
could
have
her
near
him
again
kiss
her
hold
her
close
and
acquiescent
he
wanted
nothing
more
from
life
by
her
three
minutes
of
utter
unwavering
indifference
the
girl
had
lifted
herself
from
a
high
but
somehow
casual
position
in
his
mind
to
be
instead
his
complete
preoccupation
however
much
his
wild
thoughts
varied
between
a
passionate
desire
for
her
kisses
and
an
equally
passionate
craving
to
hurt
and
mar
her
the
residue
of
his
mind
craved
in
finer
fashion
to
possess
the
triumphant
soul
that
had
shone
through
those
three
minutes
she
was
beautiful
but
especially
she
was
without
mercy
he
must
own
that
strength
that
could
send
him
away
at
present
no
such
analysis
was
possible
to
anthony
his
clarity
of
mind
all
those
endless
resources
which
he
thought
his
irony
had
brought
him
were
swept
aside
not
only
for
that
night
but
for
the
days
and
weeks
that
followed
his
books
were
to
be
but
furniture
and
his
friends
only
people
who
lived
and
walked
in
a
nebulous
outer
world
from
which
he
was
trying
to
escape
that
world
was
cold
and
full
of
bleak
wind
and
for
a
little
while
he
had
seen
into
a
warm
house
where
fires
shone
about
midnight
he
began
to
realize
that
he
was
hungry
he
went
down
into
street
where
it
was
so
cold
that
he
could
scarcely
see
the
moisture
froze
on
his
lashes
and
in
the
corners
of
his
lips
everywhere
dreariness
had
come
down
from
the
north
settling
upon
the
thin
and
cheerless
street
where
black
bundled
figures
blacker
still
against
the
night
moved
stumbling
along
the
sidewalk
through
the
shrieking
wind
sliding
their
feet
cautiously
ahead
as
though
they
were
on
skis
anthony
turned
over
toward
sixth
avenue
so
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
as
not
to
notice
that
several
had
stared
at
him
his
overcoat
was
wide
open
and
the
wind
was
biting
in
hard
and
full
of
merciless
death
after
a
while
a
waitress
spoke
to
him
a
fat
waitress
with
from
which
dangled
a
long
black
cord
order
please
her
voice
he
considered
was
unnecessarily
loud
he
looked
up
resentfully
you
wan
na
order
or
doncha
of
course
he
protested
well
i
ast
you
three
times
this
ai
no
he
glanced
at
the
big
clock
and
discovered
with
a
start
that
it
was
after
two
he
was
down
around
thirtieth
street
somewhere
and
after
a
moment
he
found
and
translated
the
illustration
transcribers
note
the
illustration
shows
the
word
child
in
mirror
image
in
a
white
semicircle
of
letters
upon
the
glass
front
the
place
was
inhabited
sparsely
by
three
or
four
bleak
and
give
me
some
bacon
and
eggs
and
coffee
please
the
waitress
bent
upon
him
a
last
disgusted
glance
and
looking
ludicrously
intellectual
in
her
corded
glasses
hurried
away
god
gloria
kisses
had
been
such
flowers
he
remembered
as
though
it
had
been
years
ago
the
low
freshness
of
her
voice
the
beautiful
lines
of
her
body
shining
through
her
clothes
her
face
under
the
lamps
of
the
street
under
the
lamps
misery
struck
at
him
again
piling
a
sort
of
terror
upon
the
ache
and
yearning
he
had
lost
her
it
was
true
no
denying
it
no
softening
it
but
a
new
idea
had
seared
his
sky
what
of
bloeckman
what
would
happen
now
there
was
a
wealthy
man
enough
to
be
tolerant
with
a
beautiful
wife
to
baby
her
whims
and
indulge
her
unreason
to
wear
her
as
she
perhaps
wished
to
be
worn
a
bright
flower
in
his
safe
and
secure
from
the
things
she
feared
he
felt
that
she
had
been
playing
with
the
idea
of
marrying
bloeckman
and
it
was
well
possible
that
this
disappointment
in
anthony
might
throw
her
on
sudden
impulse
into
bloeckman
arms
the
idea
drove
him
childishly
frantic
he
wanted
to
kill
bloeckman
and
make
him
suffer
for
his
hideous
presumption
he
was
saying
this
over
and
over
to
himself
with
his
teeth
tight
shut
and
a
perfect
orgy
of
hate
and
fright
in
his
eyes
but
behind
this
obscene
jealousy
anthony
was
in
love
at
last
profoundly
and
truly
in
love
as
the
word
goes
between
man
and
woman
his
coffee
appeared
at
his
elbow
and
gave
off
for
a
certain
time
a
gradually
diminishing
wisp
of
steam
the
night
manager
seated
at
his
desk
glanced
at
the
motionless
figure
alone
at
the
last
table
and
then
with
a
sigh
moved
down
upon
him
just
as
the
hour
hand
crossed
the
figure
three
on
the
big
clock
wisdom
after
another
day
the
turmoil
subsided
and
anthony
began
to
exercise
a
measure
of
reason
he
was
in
love
he
cried
it
passionately
to
himself
the
things
that
a
week
before
would
have
seemed
insuperable
obstacles
his
limited
income
his
desire
to
be
irresponsible
and
independent
had
in
this
forty
hours
become
the
merest
chaff
before
the
wind
of
his
infatuation
if
he
did
not
marry
her
his
life
would
be
a
feeble
parody
on
his
own
adolescence
to
be
able
to
face
people
and
to
endure
the
constant
reminder
of
gloria
that
all
existence
had
become
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
have
hope
so
he
built
hope
desperately
and
tenaciously
out
of
the
stuff
of
his
dream
a
hope
flimsy
enough
to
be
sure
a
hope
that
was
cracked
and
dissipated
a
dozen
times
a
day
a
hope
mothered
by
mockery
but
nevertheless
a
hope
that
would
be
brawn
and
sinew
to
his
out
of
this
developed
a
spark
of
wisdom
a
true
perception
of
his
own
from
out
the
effortless
past
memory
is
short
he
thought
so
very
short
at
the
crucial
point
the
trust
president
is
on
the
stand
a
potential
criminal
needing
but
one
push
to
be
a
jailbird
scorned
by
the
upright
for
leagues
around
let
him
be
acquitted
and
in
a
year
all
is
forgotten
yes
he
did
have
some
trouble
once
just
a
technicality
i
believe
oh
memory
is
very
short
anthony
had
seen
gloria
altogether
about
a
dozen
times
say
two
dozen
hours
supposing
he
left
her
alone
for
a
month
made
no
attempt
to
see
her
or
speak
to
her
and
avoided
every
place
where
she
might
possibly
be
was
it
possible
the
more
possible
because
she
had
never
loved
him
that
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
rush
of
events
would
efface
his
personality
from
her
conscious
mind
and
with
his
personality
his
offense
and
humiliation
she
would
forget
for
there
would
be
other
men
he
winced
the
implication
struck
out
at
him
other
men
two
months
god
better
three
weeks
two
weeks
he
thought
this
the
second
evening
after
the
catastrophe
when
he
was
undressing
and
at
this
point
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
bed
and
lay
there
trembling
very
slightly
and
looking
at
the
top
of
the
canopy
two
weeks
that
was
worse
than
no
time
at
all
in
two
weeks
he
would
approach
her
much
as
he
would
have
to
now
without
personality
or
confidence
remaining
still
the
man
who
had
gone
too
far
and
then
for
a
period
that
in
time
was
but
a
moment
but
in
fact
an
eternity
whined
no
two
weeks
was
too
short
a
time
whatever
poignancy
there
had
been
for
her
in
that
afternoon
must
have
time
to
dull
he
must
give
her
a
period
when
the
incident
should
fade
and
then
a
new
period
when
she
should
gradually
begin
to
think
of
him
no
matter
how
dimly
with
a
true
perspective
that
would
remember
his
pleasantness
as
well
as
his
humiliation
he
fixed
finally
on
six
weeks
as
approximately
the
interval
best
suited
to
his
purpose
and
on
a
desk
calendar
he
marked
the
days
off
finding
that
it
would
fall
on
the
ninth
of
april
very
well
on
that
day
he
would
phone
and
ask
her
if
he
might
call
until
then
silence
after
his
decision
a
gradual
improvement
was
manifest
he
had
taken
at
least
a
step
in
the
direction
to
which
hope
pointed
and
he
realized
that
the
less
he
brooded
upon
her
the
better
he
would
be
able
to
give
the
desired
impression
when
they
met
in
another
hour
he
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
the
interval
nevertheless
though
as
the
days
passed
the
glory
of
her
hair
dimmed
perceptibly
for
him
and
in
a
year
of
separation
might
have
departed
completely
the
six
weeks
held
many
abominable
days
he
dreaded
the
sight
of
dick
and
maury
imagining
wildly
that
they
knew
all
but
when
the
three
met
it
was
richard
caramel
and
not
anthony
who
was
the
centre
of
attention
the
demon
lover
had
been
accepted
for
immediate
publication
anthony
felt
that
from
now
on
he
moved
apart
he
no
longer
craved
the
warmth
and
security
of
maury
society
which
had
cheered
him
no
further
back
than
november
only
gloria
could
give
that
now
and
no
one
else
ever
again
so
dick
success
rejoiced
him
only
casually
and
worried
him
not
a
little
it
meant
that
the
world
was
going
ahead
writing
and
reading
and
publishing
and
living
and
he
wanted
the
world
to
wait
motionless
and
breathless
for
six
weeks
while
gloria
forgot
two
encounters
his
greatest
satisfaction
was
in
geraldine
company
he
took
her
once
to
dinner
and
the
theatre
and
entertained
her
several
times
in
his
apartment
when
he
was
with
her
she
absorbed
him
not
as
gloria
had
but
quieting
those
erotic
sensibilities
in
him
that
worried
over
gloria
it
did
matter
how
he
kissed
geraldine
a
kiss
was
a
kiss
to
be
enjoyed
to
the
utmost
for
its
short
moment
to
geraldine
things
belonged
in
definite
pigeonholes
a
kiss
was
one
thing
anything
further
was
quite
another
a
kiss
was
all
right
the
other
things
were
bad
when
half
the
interval
was
up
two
incidents
occurred
on
successive
days
that
upset
his
increasing
calm
and
caused
a
temporary
relapse
the
first
was
he
saw
gloria
it
was
a
short
meeting
both
bowed
both
spoke
yet
neither
heard
the
other
but
when
it
was
over
anthony
read
down
a
column
of
the
sun
three
times
in
succession
without
understanding
a
single
sentence
one
would
have
thought
sixth
avenue
a
safe
street
having
forsworn
his
barber
at
the
plaza
he
went
around
the
corner
one
morning
to
be
shaved
and
while
waiting
his
turn
he
took
off
coat
and
vest
and
with
his
soft
collar
open
at
the
neck
stood
near
the
front
of
the
shop
the
day
was
an
oasis
in
the
cold
desert
of
march
and
the
sidewalk
was
cheerful
with
a
population
of
strolling
a
stout
woman
upholstered
in
velvet
her
flabby
cheeks
too
much
massaged
swirled
by
with
her
poodle
straining
at
its
leash
the
effect
being
given
of
a
tug
bringing
in
an
ocean
liner
just
behind
them
a
man
in
a
striped
blue
suit
walking
in
feet
grinned
at
the
sight
and
catching
anthony
eye
winked
through
the
glass
anthony
laughed
thrown
immediately
into
that
humor
in
which
men
and
women
were
graceless
and
absurd
phantasms
grotesquely
curved
and
rounded
in
a
rectangular
world
of
their
own
building
they
inspired
the
same
sensations
in
him
as
did
those
strange
and
monstrous
fish
who
inhabit
the
esoteric
world
of
green
in
the
aquarium
two
more
strollers
caught
his
eye
casually
a
man
and
a
girl
then
in
a
horrified
instant
the
girl
resolved
herself
into
gloria
he
stood
here
powerless
they
came
nearer
and
gloria
glancing
in
saw
him
her
eyes
widened
and
she
smiled
politely
her
lips
moved
she
was
less
than
five
feet
away
how
do
you
do
he
muttered
inanely
gloria
happy
beautiful
and
young
with
a
man
he
had
never
seen
before
it
was
then
that
the
barber
chair
was
vacated
and
he
read
down
the
newspaper
column
three
times
in
succession
the
second
incident
took
place
the
next
day
going
into
the
manhattan
bar
about
seven
he
was
confronted
with
bloeckman
as
it
happened
the
room
was
nearly
deserted
and
before
the
mutual
recognition
he
had
stationed
himself
within
a
foot
of
the
older
man
and
ordered
his
drink
so
it
was
inevitable
that
they
should
converse
hello
patch
said
bloeckman
amiably
enough
anthony
took
the
proffered
hand
and
exchanged
a
few
aphorisms
on
the
fluctuations
of
the
mercury
do
you
come
in
here
much
inquired
bloeckman
no
very
seldom
he
omitted
to
add
that
the
plaza
bar
had
until
lately
been
his
favorite
nice
bar
one
of
the
best
bars
in
town
anthony
nodded
bloeckman
emptied
his
glass
and
picked
up
his
cane
he
was
in
evening
dress
well
i
be
hurrying
on
i
going
to
dinner
with
miss
gilbert
death
looked
suddenly
out
at
him
from
two
blue
eyes
had
he
announced
himself
as
his
prospective
murderer
he
could
not
have
struck
a
more
vital
blow
at
anthony
the
younger
man
must
have
reddened
visibly
for
his
every
nerve
was
in
instant
clamor
with
tremendous
effort
he
mustered
a
rigid
oh
so
rigid
smile
and
said
a
conventional
but
that
night
he
lay
awake
until
after
four
half
wild
with
grief
and
fear
and
abominable
imaginings
weakness
and
one
day
in
the
fifth
week
he
called
her
up
he
had
been
sitting
in
his
apartment
trying
to
read
sentimental
and
something
in
the
book
had
sent
his
thoughts
racing
in
the
direction
that
set
free
they
always
took
like
horses
racing
for
a
home
stable
with
suddenly
quickened
breath
he
walked
to
the
telephone
when
he
gave
the
number
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
voice
faltered
and
broke
like
a
schoolboy
the
central
must
have
heard
the
pounding
of
his
heart
the
sound
of
the
receiver
being
taken
up
at
the
other
end
was
a
crack
of
doom
and
gilbert
voice
soft
as
maple
syrup
running
into
a
glass
container
had
for
him
a
quality
of
horror
in
its
single
miss
gloria
not
feeling
well
she
lying
down
asleep
who
shall
i
say
called
nobody
he
shouted
in
a
wild
panic
he
slammed
down
the
receiver
collapsed
into
his
armchair
in
the
cold
sweat
of
breathless
relief
serenade
the
first
thing
he
said
to
her
was
why
you
bobbed
your
hair
and
she
answered
yes
is
it
gorgeous
it
was
not
fashionable
then
it
was
to
be
fashionable
in
five
or
six
years
at
that
time
it
was
considered
extremely
daring
it
all
sunshine
outdoors
he
said
gravely
do
you
want
to
take
a
walk
she
put
on
a
light
coat
and
a
quaintly
piquant
napoleon
hat
of
alice
blue
and
they
walked
along
the
avenue
and
into
the
zoo
where
they
properly
admired
the
grandeur
of
the
elephant
and
the
of
the
giraffe
but
did
not
visit
the
monkey
house
because
gloria
said
that
monkeys
smelt
so
bad
then
they
returned
toward
the
plaza
talking
about
nothing
but
glad
for
the
spring
singing
in
the
air
and
for
the
warm
balm
that
lay
upon
the
suddenly
golden
city
to
their
right
was
the
park
while
at
the
left
a
great
bulk
of
granite
and
marble
muttered
dully
a
millionaire
chaotic
message
to
whosoever
would
listen
something
about
i
worked
and
i
saved
and
i
was
sharper
than
all
adam
and
here
i
sit
by
golly
by
golly
all
the
newest
and
most
beautiful
designs
in
automobiles
were
out
on
fifth
avenue
and
ahead
of
them
the
plaza
loomed
up
rather
unusually
white
and
attractive
the
supple
indolent
gloria
walked
a
short
shadow
length
ahead
of
him
pouring
out
lazy
casual
comments
that
floated
a
moment
on
the
dazzling
air
before
they
reached
his
ear
oh
she
cried
i
want
to
go
south
to
hot
springs
i
want
to
get
out
in
the
air
and
just
roll
around
on
the
new
grass
and
forget
there
ever
been
any
winter
do
you
though
i
want
to
hear
a
million
robins
making
a
frightful
racket
i
sort
of
like
birds
all
women
birds
he
ventured
what
kind
am
i
quick
and
eager
a
swallow
i
think
and
sometimes
a
bird
of
paradise
most
girls
are
sparrows
of
course
see
that
row
of
over
there
sparrows
or
are
they
magpies
and
of
course
you
met
canary
girls
and
robin
girls
and
swan
girls
and
parrot
girls
all
grown
women
are
hawks
i
think
or
owls
what
am
i
a
buzzard
she
laughed
and
shook
her
head
oh
no
you
not
a
bird
at
all
do
you
think
you
a
russian
wolfhound
anthony
remembered
that
they
were
white
and
always
looked
unnaturally
hungry
but
then
they
were
usually
photographed
with
dukes
and
princesses
so
he
was
properly
flattered
dick
a
fox
terrier
a
trick
fox
terrier
she
continued
and
maury
a
cat
simultaneously
it
occurred
to
him
how
like
bloeckman
was
to
a
robust
and
offensive
hog
but
he
preserved
a
discreet
silence
later
as
they
parted
anthony
asked
when
he
might
see
her
again
do
you
ever
make
long
engagements
he
pleaded
even
if
it
a
week
ahead
i
think
it
be
fun
to
spend
a
whole
day
together
morning
and
afternoon
both
it
would
be
would
it
she
thought
for
a
moment
let
do
it
next
sunday
all
right
i
map
out
a
programme
that
take
up
every
minute
he
did
he
even
figured
to
a
nicety
what
would
happen
in
the
two
hours
when
she
would
come
to
his
apartment
for
tea
how
the
good
bounds
would
have
the
windows
wide
to
let
in
the
fresh
breeze
but
a
fire
going
also
lest
there
be
chill
in
the
air
and
how
there
would
be
clusters
of
flowers
about
in
big
cool
bowls
that
he
would
buy
for
the
occasion
they
would
sit
on
the
lounge
and
when
the
day
came
they
did
sit
upon
the
lounge
after
a
while
anthony
kissed
her
because
it
came
about
quite
naturally
he
found
sweetness
sleeping
still
upon
her
lips
and
felt
that
he
had
never
been
away
the
fire
was
bright
and
the
breeze
sighing
in
through
the
curtains
brought
a
mellow
damp
promising
may
and
world
of
summer
his
soul
thrilled
to
remote
harmonies
he
heard
the
strum
of
far
guitars
and
waters
lapping
on
a
warm
mediterranean
shore
for
he
was
young
now
as
he
would
never
be
again
and
more
triumphant
than
death
six
stole
down
too
soon
and
rang
the
querulous
melody
of
anne
chimes
on
the
corner
through
the
gathering
dusk
they
strolled
to
the
avenue
where
the
crowds
like
prisoners
released
were
walking
with
elastic
step
at
last
after
the
long
winter
and
the
tops
of
the
busses
were
thronged
with
congenial
kings
and
the
shops
full
of
fine
soft
things
for
the
summer
the
rare
summer
the
gay
promising
summer
that
seemed
for
love
what
the
winter
was
for
money
life
was
singing
for
his
supper
on
the
corner
life
was
handing
round
cocktails
in
the
street
old
women
there
were
in
that
crowd
who
felt
that
they
could
have
run
and
won
a
dash
in
bed
that
night
with
the
lights
out
and
the
cool
room
swimming
with
moonlight
anthony
lay
awake
and
played
with
every
minute
of
the
day
like
a
child
playing
in
turn
with
each
one
of
a
pile
of
christmas
toys
he
had
told
her
gently
almost
in
the
middle
of
a
kiss
that
he
loved
her
and
she
had
smiled
and
held
him
closer
and
murmured
i
glad
looking
into
his
eyes
there
had
been
a
new
quality
in
her
attitude
a
new
growth
of
sheer
physical
attraction
toward
him
and
a
strange
emotional
tenseness
that
was
enough
to
make
him
clinch
his
hands
and
draw
in
his
breath
at
the
recollection
he
had
felt
nearer
to
her
than
ever
before
in
a
rare
delight
he
cried
aloud
to
the
room
that
he
loved
her
he
phoned
next
morning
no
hesitation
now
no
uncertainty
instead
a
delirious
excitement
that
doubled
and
trebled
when
he
heard
her
voice
good
morning
gloria
good
morning
that
all
i
called
you
up
to
i
glad
you
did
i
wish
i
could
see
you
you
will
night
that
a
long
time
is
it
yes
her
voice
was
reluctant
his
hand
tightened
on
the
receiver
could
i
come
he
dared
anything
in
the
glory
and
revelation
of
that
almost
whispered
yes
i
have
a
date
oh
but
i
might
i
might
be
able
to
break
it
oh
a
sheer
cry
a
rhapsody
gloria
what
i
love
you
another
pause
and
then
i
i
glad
happiness
remarked
maury
noble
one
day
is
only
the
first
hour
after
the
alleviation
of
some
especially
intense
misery
but
oh
face
as
he
walked
down
the
corridor
of
the
plaza
that
night
his
dark
eyes
were
gleaming
around
his
mouth
were
lines
it
was
a
kindness
to
see
he
was
handsome
then
if
never
before
bound
for
one
of
those
immortal
moments
which
come
so
radiantly
that
their
remembered
light
is
enough
to
see
by
for
years
he
knocked
and
at
a
word
entered
gloria
dressed
in
simple
pink
starched
and
fresh
as
a
flower
was
across
the
room
standing
very
still
and
looking
at
him
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
she
gave
a
little
cry
and
moved
swiftly
over
the
intervening
space
her
arms
rising
in
a
premature
caress
as
she
came
near
together
they
crushed
out
the
stiff
folds
of
her
dress
in
one
triumphant
and
enduring
embrace
book

chapter
i
the
radiant
hour
after
a
fortnight
anthony
and
gloria
began
to
indulge
in
practical
discussions
as
they
called
those
sessions
when
under
the
guise
of
severe
realism
they
walked
in
an
eternal
moonlight
not
as
much
as
i
do
you
the
critic
of
would
insist
if
you
really
loved
me
you
want
every
one
to
know
it

protested
i
want
to

and
if
so
which
kind
of
clean
he
is
we
twins
ecstatic
thought
mother
says
she
hesitated
uncertainly
mother
says
that
two
souls
are
sometimes
created
together
and
and
in
love
before
they
born
bilphism
gained
its
easiest
convert
after
a
while
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
laughed
soundlessly
toward
the
ceiling
when
his
eyes
came
back
to
her
he
saw
that
she
was
angry
why
did
you
laugh
she
cried
you
done
that
twice
before
nothing
funny
about
our
relation
to
each
other
i
do
mind
playing
the
fool
and
i
do
mind
having
you
do
it
but
i
ca
stand
it
when
together
i
sorry
oh
do
say
you
sorry
if
you
ca
think
of
anything
better
than
that
just
keep
quiet
i
love
you
i
do
care
there
was
a
pause
anthony
was
depressed
at
length
gloria
murmured
i
sorry
i
was
mean
you
were
i
was
the
one
peace
was
restored
the
ensuing
moments
were
so
much
more
sweet
and
sharp
and
poignant
they
were
stars
on
this
stage
each
playing
to
an
audience
of
two
the
passion
of
their
pretense
created
the
actuality
here
finally
was
the
quintessence
of
yet
it
was
probable
that
for
the
most
part
their
love
expressed
gloria
rather
than
anthony
he
felt
often
like
a
scarcely
tolerated
guest
at
a
party
she
was
giving
telling
gilbert
had
been
an
embarrassed
matter
she
sat
stuffed
into
a
small
chair
and
listened
with
an
intense
and
very
blinky
sort
of
concentration
she
must
have
known
it
for
three
weeks
gloria
had
seen
no
one
else
and
she
must
have
noticed
that
this
time
there
was
an
authentic
difference
in
her
daughter
attitude
she
had
been
given
special
deliveries
to
post
she
had
heeded
as
all
mothers
seem
to
heed
the
hither
end
of
telephone
conversations
disguised
but
still
rather
warm
yet
she
had
delicately
professed
surprise
and
declared
herself
immensely
pleased
she
doubtless
was
so
were
the
geranium
plants
blossoming
in
the
and
so
were
the
cabbies
when
the
lovers
sought
the
romantic
privacy
of
hansom
cabs
quaint
device
and
the
staid
bill
of
fares
on
which
they
scribbled
you
know
i
do
pushing
it
over
for
the
other
to
see
but
between
kisses
anthony
and
this
golden
girl
quarrelled
incessantly
now
gloria
he
would
cry
please
let
me
explain
do
explain
kiss
me
i
do
think
that
right
if
i
hurt
your
feelings
we
ought
to
discuss
it
i
do
like
this
but
i
do
want
to
argue
i
think
it
wonderful
that
we
kiss
and
forget
and
when
we
ca
it
be
time
to
argue
at
one
time
some
gossamer
difference
attained
such
bulk
that
anthony
arose
and
punched
himself
into
his
overcoat
for
a
moment
it
appeared
that
the
scene
of
the
preceding
february
was
to
be
repeated
but
knowing
how
deeply
she
was
moved
he
retained
his
dignity
with
his
pride
and
in
a
moment
gloria
was
sobbing
in
his
arms
her
lovely
face
miserable
as
a
frightened
little
girl
meanwhile
they
kept
unfolding
to
each
other
unwillingly
by
curious
reactions
and
evasions
by
distastes
and
prejudices
and
unintended
hints
of
the
past
the
girl
was
proudly
incapable
of
jealousy
and
because
he
was
extremely
jealous
this
virtue
piqued
him
he
told
her
recondite
incidents
of
his
own
life
on
purpose
to
arouse
some
spark
of
it
but
to
no
avail
she
possessed
him
now
nor
did
she
desire
the
dead
years
oh
anthony
she
would
say
always
when
i
mean
to
you
i
sorry
afterward
i
give
my
right
hand
to
save
you
one
little
moment
pain
and
in
that
instant
her
eyes
were
brimming
and
she
was
not
aware
that
she
was
voicing
an
illusion
yet
anthony
knew
that
there
were
days
when
they
hurt
each
other
purposely
taking
almost
a
delight
in
the
thrust
incessantly
she
puzzled
him
one
hour
so
intimate
and
charming
striving
desperately
toward
an
unguessed
transcendent
union
the
next
silent
and
cold
apparently
unmoved
by
any
consideration
of
their
love
or
anything
he
could
say
often
he
would
eventually
trace
these
portentous
reticences
to
some
physical
discomfort
of
these
she
never
complained
until
they
were
over
or
to
some
carelessness
or
presumption
in
him
or
to
an
unsatisfactory
dish
at
dinner
but
even
then
the
means
by
which
she
created
the
infinite
distances
she
spread
about
herself
were
a
mystery
buried
somewhere
back
in
those
years
of
unwavering
pride
why
do
you
like
muriel
he
demanded
one
day
i
do
very
much
then
why
do
you
go
with
her
just
for
some
one
to
go
with
they
no
exertion
those
girls
they
sort
of
believe
everything
i
tell
them
but
i
rather
like
rachael
i
think
she
cute
and
so
clean
and
slick
do
you
i
used
to
have
other
friends
in
kansas
city
and
at
school
casual
all
of
them
girls
who
just
flitted
into
my
range
and
out
of
it
for
no
more
reason
than
that
boys
took
us
places
together
they
did
interest
me
after
environment
stopped
throwing
us
together
now
they
mostly
married
what
does
it
matter
they
were
all
just
people
you
like
men
better
do
you
oh
much
better
i
got
a
man
mind
you
got
a
mind
like
mine
not
strongly
gendered
either
way
later
she
told
him
about
the
beginnings
of
her
friendship
with
bloeckman
one
day
in
delmonico
gloria
and
rachael
had
come
upon
bloeckman
and
gilbert
having
luncheon
and
curiosity
had
impelled
her
to
make
it
a
party
of
four
she
had
liked
him
rather
he
was
a
relief
from
younger
men
satisfied
as
he
was
with
so
little
he
humored
her
and
he
laughed
whether
he
understood
her
or
not
she
met
him
several
times
despite
the
open
disapproval
of
her
parents
and
within
a
month
he
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
tendering
her
everything
from
a
villa
in
italy
to
a
brilliant
career
on
the
screen
she
had
laughed
in
his
face
and
he
had
laughed
too
but
he
had
not
given
up
to
the
time
of
anthony
arrival
in
the
arena
he
had
been
making
steady
progress
she
treated
him
rather
well
except
that
she
had
called
him
always
by
an
invidious
nickname
perceiving
meanwhile
that
he
was
figuratively
following
along
beside
her
as
she
walked
the
fence
ready
to
catch
her
if
she
should
fall
the
night
before
the
engagement
was
announced
she
told
bloeckman
it
was
a
heavy
blow
she
did
not
enlighten
anthony
as
to
the
details
but
she
implied
that
he
had
not
hesitated
to
argue
with
her
anthony
gathered
that
the
interview
had
terminated
on
a
stormy
note
with
gloria
very
cool
and
unmoved
lying
in
her
corner
of
the
sofa
and
joseph
bloeckman
of
films
par
excellence
pacing
the
carpet
with
eyes
narrowed
and
head
bowed
gloria
had
been
sorry
for
him
but
she
had
judged
it
best
not
to
show
it
in
a
final
burst
of
kindness
she
had
tried
to
make
him
hate
her
there
at
the
last
but
anthony
understanding
that
indifference
was
her
strongest
appeal
judged
how
futile
this
must
have
been
he
wondered
often
but
quite
casually
about
bloeckman
finally
he
forgot
him
entirely
heyday
one
afternoon
they
found
front
seats
on
the
sunny
roof
of
a
bus
and
rode
for
hours
from
the
fading
square
up
along
the
sullied
river
and
then
as
the
stray
beams
fled
the
westward
streets
sailed
down
the
turgid
avenue
darkening
with
ominous
bees
from
the
department
stores
the
traffic
was
clotted
and
gripped
in
a
patternless
jam
the
busses
were
packed
four
deep
like
platforms
above
the
crowd
as
they
waited
for
the
moan
of
the
traffic
whistle
is
it
good
cried
gloria
look
a
miller
wagon
stark
white
with
flour
driven
by
a
powdery
clown
passed
in
front
of
them
behind
a
white
horse
and
his
black
what
a
pity
she
complained
they
look
so
beautiful
in
the
dusk
if
only
both
horses
were
white
i
mighty
happy
just
this
minute
in
this
city
anthony
shook
his
head
in
disagreement
i
think
the
city
a
mountebank
always
struggling
to
approach
the
tremendous
and
impressive
urbanity
ascribed
to
it
trying
to
be
romantically
metropolitan
i
do
i
think
it
is
impressive
momentarily
but
it
really
a
transparent
artificial
sort
of
spectacle
it
got
its
stars
and
its
flimsy
unenduring
stage
settings
and
i
admit
the
greatest
army
of
supers
ever
assembled
he
paused
laughed
shortly
and
added
technically
excellent
perhaps
but
not
convincing
i
bet
policemen
think
people
are
fools
said
gloria
thoughtfully
as
she
watched
a
large
but
cowardly
lady
being
helped
across
the
street
he
always
sees
them
frightened
and
inefficient
and
old
they
are
she
added
and
then
we
better
get
off
i
told
mother
i
have
an
early
supper
and
go
to
bed
she
says
i
look
tired
damn
it
i
wish
we
were
married
he
muttered
soberly
there
be
no
good
night
then
and
we
can
do
just
as
we
want
wo
it
be
good
i
think
we
ought
to
travel
a
lot
i
want
to
go
to
the
mediterranean
and
italy
and
i
like
to
go
on
the
stage
some
time
say
for
about
a
year
you
bet
i
write
a
play
for
you
wo
that
be
good
and
i
act
in
it
and
then
some
time
when
we
have
more
money
old
adam
death
was
always
thus
tactfully
alluded
to
we
build
a
magnificent
estate
wo
we
oh
yes
with
private
swimming
pools
dozens
of
them
and
private
rivers
oh
i
wish
it
were
now
odd
coincidence
he
had
just
been
wishing
that
very
thing
they
plunged
like
divers
into
the
dark
eddying
crowd
and
emerging
in
the
cool
fifties
sauntered
indolently
homeward
infinitely
romantic
to
each
other
both
were
walking
alone
in
a
dispassionate
garden
with
a
ghost
found
in
a
dream
halcyon
days
like
boats
drifting
along
rivers
spring
evenings
full
of
a
plaintive
melancholy
that
made
the
past
beautiful
and
bitter
bidding
them
look
back
and
see
that
the
loves
of
other
summers
long
gone
were
dead
with
the
forgotten
waltzes
of
their
years
always
the
most
poignant
moments
were
when
some
artificial
barrier
kept
them
apart
in
the
theatre
their
hands
would
steal
together
join
give
and
return
gentle
pressures
through
the
long
dark
in
crowded
rooms
they
would
form
words
with
their
lips
for
each
other
eyes
not
knowing
that
they
were
but
following
in
the
footsteps
of
dusty
generations
but
comprehending
dimly
that
if
truth
is
the
end
of
life
happiness
is
a
mode
of
it
to
be
cherished
in
its
brief
and
tremulous
moment
and
then
one
fairy
night
may
became
june
sixteen
days
now
fifteen
fourteen
three
digressions
just
before
the
engagement
was
announced
anthony
had
gone
up
to
tarrytown
to
see
his
grandfather
who
a
little
more
wizened
and
grizzly
as
time
played
its
ultimate
chuckling
tricks
greeted
the
news
with
profound
cynicism
oh
you
going
to
get
married
are
you
he
said
this
with
such
a
dubious
mildness
and
shook
his
head
up
and
down
so
many
times
that
anthony
was
not
a
little
depressed
while
he
was
unaware
of
his
grandfather
intentions
he
presumed
that
a
large
part
of
the
money
would
come
to
him
a
good
deal
would
go
in
charities
of
course
a
good
deal
to
carry
on
the
business
of
reform
are
you
going
to
work
why
temporized
anthony
somewhat
disconcerted
i
working
you
know
ah
i
mean
work
said
adam
patch
dispassionately
i
not
quite
sure
yet
what
i
do
i
not
exactly
a
beggar
grampa
he
asserted
with
some
spirit
the
old
man
considered
this
with
eyes
half
closed
then
almost
apologetically
he
asked
how
much
do
you
save
a
year
nothing
so
far
and
so
after
just
managing
to
get
along
on
your
money
you
decided
that
by
some
miracle
two
of
you
can
get
along
on
it
gloria
has
some
money
of
her
own
enough
to
buy
clothes
how
much
without
considering
this
question
impertinent
anthony
answered
it
about
a
hundred
a
month
that
altogether
about
hundred
a
year
then
he
added
softly
it
ought
to
be
plenty
if
you
have
any
sense
it
ought
to
be
plenty
but
the
question
is
whether
you
have
any
or
not
i
suppose
it
is
it
was
shameful
to
be
compelled
to
endure
this
pious
browbeating
from
the
old
man
and
his
next
words
were
stiffened
with
vanity
i
can
manage
very
well
you
seem
convinced
that
i
utterly
worthless
at
any
rate
i
came
up
here
simply
to
tell
you
that
getting
married
in
june
sir
with
this
he
turned
away
and
headed
for
the
door
unaware
that
in
that
instant
his
grandfather
for
the
first
time
rather
liked
him
wait
called
adam
patch
i
want
to
talk
to
you
anthony
faced
about
well
sir
sit
down
stay
all
night
somewhat
mollified
anthony
resumed
his
seat
i
sorry
sir
but
i
going
to
see
gloria
what
her
name
gloria
gilbert
new
york
girl
someone
you
know
she
from
the
middle
west
what
business
her
father
in
in
a
celluloid
corporation
or
trust
or
something
they
from
kansas
city
you
going
to
be
married
out
there
why
no
sir
we
thought
we
be
married
in
new
york
rather
quietly
like
to
have
the
wedding
out
here
anthony
hesitated
the
suggestion
made
no
appeal
to
him
but
it
was
certainly
the
part
of
wisdom
to
give
the
old
man
if
possible
a
proprietary
interest
in
his
married
life
in
addition
anthony
was
a
little
touched
that
very
kind
of
you
grampa
but
would
it
be
a
lot
of
trouble
everything
a
lot
of
trouble
your
father
was
married
here
but
in
the
old
house
why
i
thought
he
was
married
in
boston
adam
patch
considered
that
true
he
married
in
boston
anthony
felt
a
moment
embarrassment
at
having
made
the
correction
and
he
covered
it
up
with
words
well
i
speak
to
gloria
about
it
personally
i
like
to
but
of
course
it
up
to
the
gilberts
you
see
his
grandfather
drew
a
long
sigh
half
closed
his
eyes
and
sank
back
in
his
chair
in
a
hurry
he
asked
in
a
different
tone
not
especially
i
wonder
began
adam
patch
looking
out
with
a
mild
kindly
glance
at
the
lilac
bushes
that
rustled
against
the
windows
i
wonder
if
you
ever
think
about
the
why
sometimes
i
think
a
great
deal
about
the
his
eyes
were
dim
but
his
voice
was
confident
and
clear
i
was
sitting
here
thinking
about
what
lying
in
wait
for
us
and
somehow
i
began
to
remember
an
afternoon
nearly
years
ago
when
i
was
playing
with
my
little
sister
annie
down
where
that
is
now
he
pointed
out
into
the
long
his
eyes
trembling
of
tears
his
voice
shaking
i
began
thinking
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
ought
to
think
a
little
more
about
the
you
ought
to
be
steadier
he
paused
and
seemed
to
grope
about
for
the
right
word
more
industrious
why
then
his
expression
altered
his
entire
personality
seemed
to
snap
together
like
a
trap
and
when
he
continued
the
softness
had
gone
from
his
why
when
i
was
just
two
years
older
than
you
he
rasped
with
a
cunning
chuckle
i
sent
three
members
of
the
firm
of
wrenn
and
hunt
to
the
poorhouse
anthony
started
with
embarrassment
well
added
his
grandfather
suddenly
you
miss
your
train
anthony
left
the
house
unusually
elated
and
strangely
sorry
for
the
old
man
not
because
his
wealth
could
buy
him
neither
youth
nor
digestion
but
because
he
had
asked
anthony
to
be
married
there
and
because
he
had
forgotten
something
about
his
son
wedding
that
he
should
have
remembered
richard
caramel
who
was
one
of
the
ushers
caused
anthony
and
gloria
much
distress
in
the
last
few
weeks
by
continually
stealing
the
rays
of
their
the
demon
lover
had
been
published
in
april
and
it
interrupted
the
love
affair
as
it
may
be
said
to
have
interrupted
everything
its
author
came
in
contact
with
it
was
a
highly
original
rather
overwritten
piece
of
sustained
description
concerned
with
a
don
juan
of
the
new
york
slums
as
maury
and
anthony
had
said
before
as
the
more
hospitable
critics
were
saying
then
there
was
no
writer
in
america
with
such
power
to
describe
the
atavistic
and
unsubtle
reactions
of
that
section
of
society
the
book
hesitated
and
then
suddenly
went
editions
small
at
first
then
larger
crowded
each
other
week
by
week
a
spokesman
of
the
salvation
army
denounced
it
as
a
cynical
misrepresentation
of
all
the
uplift
taking
place
in
the
underworld
clever
spread
the
unfounded
rumor
that
gypsy
smith
was
beginning
a
libel
suit
because
one
of
the
principal
characters
was
a
burlesque
of
himself
it
was
barred
from
the
public
library
of
burlington
iowa
and
a
columnist
announced
by
innuendo
that
richard
caramel
was
in
a
sanitarium
with
delirium
tremens
the
author
indeed
spent
his
days
in
a
state
of
pleasant
madness
the
book
was
in
his
conversation
of
the
time
he
wanted
to
know
if
one
had
heard
the
latest
he
would
go
into
a
store
and
in
a
loud
voice
order
books
to
be
charged
to
him
in
order
to
catch
a
chance
morsel
of
recognition
from
clerk
or
customer
he
knew
to
a
town
in
what
sections
of
the
country
it
was
selling
best
he
knew
exactly
what
he
cleared
on
each
edition
and
when
he
met
any
one
who
had
not
read
it
or
as
it
happened
only
too
often
had
not
heard
of
it
he
succumbed
to
moody
depression
so
it
was
natural
for
anthony
and
gloria
to
decide
in
their
jealousy
that
he
was
so
swollen
with
conceit
as
to
be
a
bore
to
dick
great
annoyance
gloria
publicly
boasted
that
she
had
never
read
the
demon
lover
and
did
intend
to
until
every
one
stopped
talking
about
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
had
no
time
to
read
now
for
the
presents
were
pouring
in
first
a
scattering
then
an
avalanche
varying
from
the
of
forgotten
family
friends
to
the
photographs
of
forgotten
poor
relations
maury
gave
them
an
elaborate
drinking
set
which
included
silver
goblets
cocktail
shaker
and
the
extortion
from
dick
was
more
conventional
a
tea
set
from
tiffany
from
joseph
bloeckman
came
a
simple
and
exquisite
travelling
clock
with
his
card
there
was
even
a
from
bounds
this
touched
anthony
and
made
him
want
to
weep
indeed
any
emotion
short
of
hysteria
seemed
natural
in
the
people
who
were
swept
up
by
this
tremendous
sacrifice
to
convention
the
room
set
aside
in
the
plaza
bulged
with
offerings
sent
by
harvard
friends
and
by
associates
of
his
grandfather
with
remembrances
of
gloria
farmover
days
and
with
rather
pathetic
trophies
from
her
former
beaux
which
last
arrived
with
esoteric
melancholy
messages
written
on
cards
tucked
carefully
inside
beginning
i
little
thought
when
or
i
sure
i
wish
you
all
the
happiness
or
even
when
you
get
this
i
shall
be
on
my
way
to
the
most
munificent
gift
was
simultaneously
the
most
disappointing
it
was
a
concession
of
adam
patch
a
check
for
five
thousand
dollars
to
most
of
the
presents
anthony
was
cold
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
would
necessitate
keeping
a
chart
of
the
marital
status
of
all
their
acquaintances
during
the
next
but
gloria
exulted
in
each
one
tearing
at
the
and
excelsior
with
the
rapaciousness
of
a
dog
digging
for
a
bone
breathlessly
seizing
a
ribbon
or
an
edge
of
metal
and
finally
bringing
to
light
the
whole
article
and
holding
it
up
critically
no
emotion
except
rapt
interest
in
her
unsmiling
face
look
anthony
darn
nice
is
it
no
answer
until
an
hour
later
when
she
would
give
him
a
careful
account
of
her
precise
reaction
to
the
gift
whether
it
would
have
been
improved
by
being
smaller
or
larger
whether
she
was
surprised
at
getting
it
and
if
so
just
how
much
surprised
gilbert
arranged
and
rearranged
a
hypothetical
house
distributing
the
gifts
among
the
different
rooms
tabulating
articles
as
clock
or
silver
to
use
day
and
embarrassing
anthony
and
gloria
by
references
to
a
room
she
called
the
nursery
she
was
pleased
by
old
adam
gift
and
thereafter
had
it
that
he
was
a
very
ancient
soul
as
much
as
anything
else
as
adam
patch
never
quite
decided
whether
she
referred
to
the
advancing
senility
of
his
mind
or
to
some
private
and
psychic
schema
of
her
own
it
can
not
be
said
to
have
pleased
him
indeed
he
always
spoke
of
her
to
anthony
as
that
old
woman
the
mother
as
though
she
were
a
character
in
a
comedy
he
had
seen
staged
many
times
before
concerning
gloria
he
was
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
she
attracted
him
but
as
she
herself
told
anthony
he
had
decided
that
she
was
frivolous
and
was
afraid
to
approve
of
her
five
days
a
dancing
platform
was
being
erected
on
the
lawn
at
tarrytown
four
days
a
special
train
was
chartered
to
convey
the
guests
to
and
from
new
york
three
days
the
diary
she
was
dressed
in
blue
silk
pajamas
and
standing
by
her
bed
with
her
hand
on
the
light
to
put
the
room
in
darkness
when
she
changed
her
mind
and
opening
a
table
drawer
brought
out
a
little
black
book
a
diary
this
she
had
kept
for
seven
years
many
of
the
pencil
entries
were
almost
illegible
and
there
were
notes
and
references
to
nights
and
afternoons
long
since
forgotten
for
it
was
not
an
intimate
diary
even
though
it
began
with
the
immemorial
i
am
going
to
keep
a
diary
for
my
children
yet
as
she
thumbed
over
the
pages
the
eyes
of
many
men
seemed
to
look
out
at
her
from
their
names
with
one
she
had
gone
to
new
haven
for
the
first
time
in
when
she
was
sixteen
and
padded
shoulders
were
fashionable
at
yale
she
had
been
flattered
because
touch
down
michaud
had
rushed
her
all
evening
she
sighed
remembering
the
satin
dress
she
had
been
so
proud
of
and
the
orchestra
playing
my
yama
man
and
so
long
ago
the
names
eltynge
reardon
jim
parsons
curly
mcgregor
kenneth
cowan
fry
whom
she
had
liked
for
being
so
ugly
carter
kirby
he
had
sent
her
a
present
so
had
tudor
baird
marty
reffer
the
first
man
she
had
been
in
love
with
for
more
than
a
day
and
stuart
holcome
who
had
run
away
with
her
in
his
automobile
and
tried
to
make
her
marry
him
by
force
and
larry
fenwick
whom
she
had
always
admired
because
he
had
told
her
one
night
that
if
she
would
kiss
him
she
could
get
out
of
his
car
and
walk
home
what
a
list
and
after
all
an
obsolete
list
she
was
in
love
now
set
for
the
eternal
romance
that
was
to
be
the
synthesis
of
all
romance
yet
sad
for
these
men
and
these
moonlights
and
for
the
thrills
she
had
had
and
the
kisses
the
past
her
past
oh
what
a
joy
she
had
been
exuberantly
happy
turning
over
the
pages
her
eyes
rested
idly
on
the
scattered
entries
of
the
past
four
months
she
read
the
last
few
carefully
i
know
bill
carstairs
hates
me
because
i
was
so
disagreeable
but
i
hate
to
be
sentimentalized
over
sometimes
we
drove
out
to
the
rockyear
country
club
and
the
most
wonderful
moon
kept
shining
through
the
trees
my
silver
dress
is
getting
tarnished
funny
how
one
forgets
the
other
nights
at
rockyear
with
kenneth
cowan
when
i
loved
him
so
after
two
hours
of
schroeder
who
they
inform
me
has
millions
i
decided
that
this
matter
of
sticking
to
things
wears
one
out
particularly
when
the
things
concerned
are
men
there
nothing
so
often
overdone
and
from
i
swear
to
be
amused
we
talked
about
how
banal
with
how
many
men
have
i
talked
about
love
patch
actually
called
up
and
when
he
forswore
me
about
a
month
ago
he
fairly
raged
out
the
door
i
gradually
losing
faith
in
any
man
being
susceptible
to
fatal
injuries
spent
the
day
with
anthony
maybe
i
marry
him
some
time
i
kind
of
like
his
ideas
he
stimulates
all
the
originality
in
me
blockhead
came
around
about
ten
in
his
new
car
and
took
me
out
riverside
drive
i
liked
him
he
so
considerate
he
knew
i
did
want
to
talk
so
he
was
quiet
all
during
the
ride
woke
up
thinking
of
anthony
and
sure
enough
he
called
and
sounded
sweet
on
the
phone
so
i
broke
a
date
for
him
i
feel
i
break
anything
for
him
including
the
ten
commandments
and
my
neck
he
coming
at
eight
and
i
shall
wear
pink
and
look
very
fresh
and
starched
she
paused
here
remembering
that
after
he
had
gone
that
night
she
had
undressed
with
the
shivering
april
air
streaming
in
the
windows
yet
it
seemed
she
had
not
felt
the
cold
warmed
by
the
profound
banalities
burning
in
her
heart
the
next
entry
occurred
a
few
days
later
i
want
to
marry
anthony
because
husbands
are
so
often
and
i
must
marry
a
lover
there
are
four
general
types
of
husbands
the
husband
who
always
wants
to
stay
in
in
the
evening
has
no
vices
and
works
for
a
salary
totally
undesirable
the
atavistic
master
whose
mistress
one
is
to
wait
on
his
pleasure
this
sort
always
considers
every
pretty
woman
a
sort
of
peacock
with
arrested
development
next
comes
the
worshipper
the
idolater
of
his
wife
and
all
that
is
his
to
the
utter
oblivion
of
everything
else
this
sort
demands
an
emotional
actress
for
a
wife
god
it
must
be
an
exertion
to
be
thought
righteous
and
anthony
a
temporarily
passionate
lover
with
wisdom
enough
to
realize
when
it
has
flown
and
that
it
must
fly
and
i
want
to
get
married
to
anthony
what
grubworms
women
are
to
crawl
on
their
bellies
through
colorless
marriages
marriage
was
created
not
to
be
a
background
but
to
need
one
mine
is
going
to
be
outstanding
it
ca
sha
be
the
setting
going
to
be
the
performance
the
live
lovely
glamourous
performance
and
the
world
shall
be
the
scenery
i
refuse
to
dedicate
my
life
to
posterity
surely
one
owes
as
much
to
the
current
generation
as
to
unwanted
children
what
a
fate
to
grow
rotund
and
unseemly
to
lose
my
to
think
in
terms
of
milk
oatmeal
nurse
diapers
dear
dream
children
how
much
more
beautiful
you
are
dazzling
little
creatures
who
flutter
all
dream
children
must
flutter
on
golden
golden
wings
such
children
however
poor
dear
babies
have
little
in
common
with
the
wedded
state
moral
question
was
it
wrong
to
make
bloeckman
love
me
because
i
did
really
make
him
he
was
almost
sweetly
sad
how
opportune
it
was
that
my
throat
is
swollen
plunk
together
and
tears
were
easy
to
muster
but
he
just
the
past
buried
already
in
my
plentiful
lavender
and
i
promised
not
to
chew
my
mouth
well
i
wo
i
suppose
but
if
he
only
asked
me
not
to
eat
blowing
bubbles
that
what
we
doing
anthony
and
me
and
we
blew
such
beautiful
ones
and
they
explode
and
then
we
blow
more
and
more
i
guess
bubbles
just
as
big
and
just
as
beautiful
until
all
the
soap
and
water
is
used
up
on
this
note
the
diary
ended
her
eyes
wandered
up
the
page
over
the
june
of
the
earliest
entry
was
scrawled
in
the
plump
bulbous
hand
of
a
girl
it
was
the
name
bob
lamar
and
a
word
she
could
not
decipher
then
she
knew
what
it
was
and
knowing
she
found
her
eyes
misty
with
tears
there
in
a
graying
blur
was
the
record
of
her
first
kiss
faded
as
its
intimate
afternoon
on
a
rainy
veranda
seven
years
before
she
seemed
to
remember
something
one
of
them
had
said
that
day
and
yet
she
could
not
remember
her
tears
came
faster
until
she
could
scarcely
see
the
page
she
was
crying
she
told
herself
because
she
could
remember
only
the
rain
and
the
wet
flowers
in
the
yard
and
the
smell
of
the
damp
grass
after
a
moment
she
found
a
pencil
and
holding
it
unsteadily
drew
three
parallel
lines
beneath
the
last
entry
then
she
printed
finis
in
large
capitals
put
the
book
back
in
the
drawer
and
crept
into
bed
breath
of
the
cave
back
in
his
apartment
after
the
bridal
dinner
anthony
snapped
out
his
lights
and
feeling
impersonal
and
fragile
as
a
piece
of
china
waiting
on
a
serving
table
got
into
bed
it
was
a
warm
night
a
sheet
was
enough
for
comfort
and
through
his
windows
came
sound
evanescent
and
summery
alive
with
remote
anticipation
he
was
thinking
that
the
young
years
behind
him
hollow
and
colorful
had
been
lived
in
facile
and
vacillating
cynicism
upon
the
recorded
emotions
of
men
long
dust
and
there
was
something
beyond
that
he
knew
now
there
was
the
union
of
his
soul
with
gloria
whose
radiant
fire
and
freshness
was
the
living
material
of
which
the
dead
beauty
of
books
was
made
from
the
night
into
his
room
there
came
persistently
that
evanescent
and
dissolving
sound
something
the
city
was
tossing
up
and
calling
back
again
like
a
child
playing
with
a
ball
in
harlem
the
bronx
gramercy
park
and
along
the
in
little
parlors
or
on
roofs
a
thousand
lovers
were
making
this
sound
crying
little
fragments
of
it
into
the
air
all
the
city
was
playing
with
this
sound
out
there
in
the
blue
summer
dark
throwing
it
up
and
calling
it
back
promising
that
in
a
little
while
life
would
be
beautiful
as
a
story
promising
happiness
and
by
that
promise
giving
it
it
gave
love
hope
in
its
own
survival
it
could
do
no
more
it
was
then
that
a
new
note
separated
itself
jarringly
from
the
soft
crying
of
the
night
it
was
a
noise
from
an
areaway
within
a
hundred
feet
from
his
rear
window
the
noise
of
a
woman
laughter
it
began
low
incessant
and
whining
some
with
her
fellow
he
thought
and
then
it
grew
in
volume
and
became
hysterical
until
it
reminded
him
of
a
girl
he
had
seen
overcome
with
nervous
laughter
at
a
vaudeville
performance
then
it
sank
receded
only
to
rise
again
and
include
words
a
coarse
joke
some
bit
of
obscure
horseplay
he
could
not
distinguish
it
would
break
off
for
a
moment
and
he
would
just
catch
the
low
rumble
of
a
man
voice
then
begin
again
interminably
at
first
annoying
then
strangely
terrible
he
shivered
and
getting
up
out
of
bed
went
to
the
window
it
had
reached
a
high
point
tensed
and
stifled
almost
the
quality
of
a
scream
then
it
ceased
and
left
behind
it
a
silence
empty
and
menacing
as
the
greater
silence
overhead
anthony
stood
by
the
window
a
moment
longer
before
he
returned
to
his
bed
he
found
himself
upset
and
shaken
try
as
he
might
to
strangle
his
reaction
some
animal
quality
in
that
unrestrained
laughter
had
grasped
at
his
imagination
and
for
the
first
time
in
four
months
aroused
his
old
aversion
and
horror
toward
all
the
business
of
life
the
room
had
grown
smothery
he
wanted
to
be
out
in
some
cool
and
bitter
breeze
miles
above
the
cities
and
to
live
serene
and
detached
back
in
the
corners
of
his
mind
life
was
that
sound
out
there
that
ghastly
reiterated
female
sound
oh
my
he
cried
drawing
in
his
breath
sharply
burying
his
face
in
the
pillows
he
tried
in
vain
to
concentrate
upon
the
details
of
the
next
day
morning
in
the
gray
light
he
found
that
it
was
only
five
he
regretted
nervously
that
he
had
awakened
so
early
he
would
appear
fagged
at
the
wedding
he
envied
gloria
who
could
hide
her
fatigue
with
careful
pigmentation
in
his
bathroom
he
contemplated
himself
in
the
mirror
and
saw
that
he
was
unusually
white
half
a
dozen
small
imperfections
stood
out
against
the
morning
pallor
of
his
complexion
and
overnight
he
had
grown
the
faint
stubble
of
a
beard
the
general
effect
he
fancied
was
unprepossessing
haggard
half
unwell
on
his
dressing
table
were
spread
a
number
of
articles
which
he
told
over
carefully
with
suddenly
fumbling
fingers
their
tickets
to
california
the
book
of
traveller
checks
his
watch
set
to
the
half
minute
the
key
to
his
apartment
which
he
must
not
forget
to
give
to
maury
and
most
important
of
all
the
ring
it
was
of
platinum
set
around
with
small
emeralds
gloria
had
insisted
on
this
she
had
always
wanted
an
emerald
wedding
ring
she
said
it
was
the
third
present
he
had
given
her
first
had
come
the
engagement
ring
and
then
a
little
gold
he
would
be
giving
her
many
things
now
clothes
and
jewels
and
friends
and
excitement
it
seemed
absurd
that
from
now
on
he
would
pay
for
all
her
meals
it
was
going
to
cost
he
wondered
if
he
had
not
underestimated
for
this
trip
and
if
he
had
not
better
cash
a
larger
check
the
question
worried
him
then
the
breathless
impendency
of
the
event
swept
his
mind
clear
of
details
this
was
the
day
unsought
unsuspected
six
months
before
but
now
breaking
in
yellow
light
through
his
east
window
dancing
along
the
carpet
as
though
the
sun
were
smiling
at
some
ancient
and
reiterated
gag
of
his
own

in
a

minute
i
think
of
that
about
the
mice
otis
i
was
usher
last
month
for
old
charlie
mcintyre
and
move
slowly
toward
the
door
as
the
chatter
becomes
a
babel
and
the
practising
preliminary
to
the
overture
issues
in
long
pious
groans
from
adam
patch
anthony
there
were
five
hundred
eyes
boring
through
the
back
of
his
cutaway
and
the
sun
glinting
on
the
clergyman
inappropriately
bourgeois
teeth
with
difficulty
he
restrained
a
laugh
gloria
was
saying
something
in
a
clear
proud
voice
and
he
tried
to
think
that
the
affair
was
irrevocable
that
every
second
was
significant
that
his
life
was
being
slashed
into
two
periods
and
that
the
face
of
the
world
was
changing
before
him
he
tried
to
recapture
that
ecstatic
sensation
of
ten
weeks
before
all
these
emotions
eluded
him
he
did
not
even
feel
the
physical
nervousness
of
that
very
morning
it
was
all
one
gigantic
aftermath
and
those
gold
teeth
he
wondered
if
the
clergyman
were
married
he
wondered
perversely
if
a
clergyman
could
perform
his
own
marriage
service
but
as
he
took
gloria
into
his
arms
he
was
conscious
of
a
strong
reaction
the
blood
was
moving
in
his
veins
now
a
languorous
and
pleasant
content
settled
like
a
weight
upon
him
bringing
responsibility
and
possession
he
was
married
gloria
so
many
such
mingled
emotions
that
no
one
of
them
was
separable
from
the
others
she
could
have
wept
for
her
mother
who
was
crying
quietly
back
there
ten
feet
and
for
the
loveliness
of
the
june
sunlight
flooding
in
at
the
windows
she
was
beyond
all
conscious
perceptions
only
a
sense
colored
with
delirious
wild
excitement
that
the
ultimately
important
was
happening
and
a
trust
fierce
and
passionate
burning
in
her
like
a
prayer
that
in
a
moment
she
would
be
forever
and
securely
safe
late
one
night
they
arrived
in
santa
barbara
where
the
night
clerk
at
the
hotel
lafcadio
refused
to
admit
them
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
not
married
the
clerk
thought
that
gloria
was
beautiful
he
did
not
think
that
anything
so
beautiful
as
gloria
could
be
moral
con
amore
that
first
the
trip
west
the
long
months
loiter
along
the
california
coast
and
the
gray
house
near
greenwich
where
they
lived
until
late
autumn
made
the
country
dreary
those
days
those
places
saw
the
enraptured
hours
the
breathless
idyl
of
their
engagement
gave
way
first
to
the
intense
romance
of
the
more
passionate
relationship
the
breathless
idyl
left
them
fled
on
to
other
lovers
they
looked
around
one
day
and
it
was
gone
how
they
scarcely
knew
had
either
of
them
lost
the
other
in
the
days
of
the
idyl
the
love
lost
would
have
been
ever
to
the
loser
that
dim
desire
without
fulfilment
which
stands
back
of
all
life
but
magic
must
hurry
on
and
the
lovers
remain
the
idyl
passed
bearing
with
it
its
extortion
of
youth
came
a
day
when
gloria
found
that
other
men
no
longer
bored
her
came
a
day
when
anthony
discovered
that
he
could
sit
again
late
into
the
evening
talking
with
dick
of
those
tremendous
abstractions
that
had
once
occupied
his
world
but
knowing
they
had
had
the
best
of
love
they
clung
to
what
remained
love
lingered
by
way
of
long
conversations
at
night
into
those
stark
hours
when
the
mind
thins
and
sharpens
and
the
borrowings
from
dreams
become
the
stuff
of
all
life
by
way
of
deep
and
intimate
kindnesses
they
developed
toward
each
other
by
way
of
their
laughing
at
the
same
absurdities
and
thinking
the
same
things
noble
and
the
same
things
sad
it
was
first
of
all
a
time
of
discovery
the
things
they
found
in
each
other
were
so
diverse
so
intermixed
and
moreover
so
sugared
with
love
as
to
seem
at
the
time
not
so
much
discoveries
as
isolated
phenomena
to
be
allowed
for
and
to
be
forgotten
anthony
found
that
he
was
living
with
a
girl
of
tremendous
nervous
tension
and
of
the
most
selfishness
gloria
knew
within
a
month
that
her
husband
was
an
utter
coward
toward
any
one
of
a
million
phantasms
created
by
his
imagination
her
perception
was
intermittent
for
this
cowardice
sprang
out
became
almost
obscenely
evident
then
faded
and
vanished
as
though
it
had
been
only
a
creation
of
her
own
mind
her
reactions
to
it
were
not
those
attributed
to
her
sex
it
roused
her
neither
to
disgust
nor
to
a
premature
feeling
of
motherhood
herself
almost
completely
without
physical
fear
she
was
unable
to
understand
and
so
she
made
the
most
of
what
she
felt
to
be
his
fear
redeeming
feature
which
was
that
though
he
was
a
coward
under
a
shock
and
a
coward
under
a
strain
when
his
imagination
was
given
play
he
had
yet
a
sort
of
dashing
recklessness
that
moved
her
on
its
brief
occasions
almost
to
admiration
and
a
pride
that
usually
steadied
him
when
he
thought
he
was
observed
the
trait
first
showed
itself
in
a
dozen
incidents
of
little
more
than
nervousness
his
warning
to
a
against
fast
driving
in
chicago
his
refusal
to
take
her
to
a
certain
tough
café
she
had
always
wished
to
visit
these
of
course
admitted
the
conventional
interpretation
that
it
was
of
her
he
had
been
thinking
nevertheless
their
culminative
weight
disturbed
her
but
something
that
occurred
in
a
san
francisco
hotel
when
they
had
been
married
a
week
gave
the
matter
certainty
it
was
after
midnight
and
pitch
dark
in
their
room
gloria
was
dozing
off
and
anthony
even
breathing
beside
her
made
her
suppose
that
he
was
asleep
when
suddenly
she
saw
him
raise
himself
on
his
elbow
and
stare
at
the
window
what
is
it
dearest
she
murmured
nothing
he
had
relaxed
to
his
pillow
and
turned
toward
her
nothing
my
darling
wife
do
say
i
your
mistress
wife
such
an
ugly
word
your
mistress
is
so
much
more
tangible
and
desirable
come
into
my
arms
she
added
in
a
rush
of
tenderness
i
can
sleep
so
well
so
well
with
you
in
my
arms
coming
into
gloria
arms
had
a
quite
definite
meaning
it
required
that
he
should
slide
one
arm
under
her
shoulder
lock
both
arms
about
her
and
arrange
himself
as
nearly
as
possible
as
a
sort
of
crib
for
her
luxurious
ease
anthony
who
tossed
whose
arms
went
tinglingly
to
sleep
after
half
an
hour
of
that
position
would
wait
until
she
was
asleep
and
roll
her
gently
over
to
her
side
of
the
bed
then
left
to
his
own
devices
he
would
curl
himself
into
his
usual
knots
gloria
having
attained
sentimental
comfort
retired
into
her
doze
five
minutes
ticked
away
on
bloeckman
travelling
clock
silence
lay
all
about
the
room
over
the
unfamiliar
impersonal
furniture
and
the
ceiling
that
melted
imperceptibly
into
invisible
walls
on
both
sides
then
there
was
suddenly
a
rattling
flutter
at
the
window
staccato
and
loud
upon
the
hushed
pent
air
with
a
leap
anthony
was
out
of
the
bed
and
standing
tense
beside
it
who
there
he
cried
in
an
awful
voice
gloria
lay
very
still
wide
awake
now
and
engrossed
not
so
much
in
the
rattling
as
in
the
rigid
breathless
figure
whose
voice
had
reached
from
the
bedside
into
that
ominous
dark
the
sound
stopped
the
room
was
quiet
as
before
then
anthony
pouring
words
in
at
the
telephone
some
one
just
tried
to
get
into
the
room
there
some
one
at
the
window
his
voice
was
emphatic
now
faintly
terrified
all
right
hurry
he
hung
up
the
receiver
stood
motionless
there
was
a
rush
and
commotion
at
the
door
a
knocking
anthony
went
to
open
it
upon
an
excited
night
clerk
with
three
grouped
staring
behind
him
between
thumb
and
finger
the
night
clerk
held
a
wet
pen
with
the
threat
of
a
weapon
one
of
the
had
seized
a
telephone
directory
and
was
looking
at
it
sheepishly
simultaneously
the
group
was
joined
by
the
hastily
summoned
and
as
one
man
they
surged
into
the
room
lights
sprang
on
with
a
click
gathering
a
piece
of
sheet
about
her
gloria
dove
away
from
sight
shutting
her
eyes
to
keep
out
the
horror
of
this
unpremeditated
visitation
there
was
no
vestige
of
an
idea
in
her
stricken
sensibilities
save
that
her
anthony
was
at
grievous
fault
the
night
clerk
was
speaking
from
the
window
his
tone
half
of
the
servant
half
of
the
teacher
reproving
a
schoolboy
nobody
out
there
he
declared
conclusively
my
golly
nobody
be
out
there
this
here
a
sheer
fall
to
the
street
of
fifty
feet
it
was
the
wind
you
heard
tugging
at
the
blind
oh
then
she
was
sorry
for
him
she
wanted
only
to
comfort
him
and
draw
him
back
tenderly
into
her
arms
to
tell
them
to
go
away
because
the
thing
their
presence
connotated
was
odious
yet
she
could
not
raise
her
head
for
shame
she
heard
a
broken
sentence
apologies
conventions
of
the
employee
and
one
unrestrained
snicker
from
a
i
been
nervous
as
the
devil
all
evening
anthony
was
saying
somehow
that
noise
just
shook
me
i
was
only
about
half
awake
sure
i
understand
said
the
night
clerk
with
comfortable
tact
been
that
way
myself
the
door
closed
the
lights
snapped
out
anthony
crossed
the
floor
quietly
and
crept
into
bed
gloria
feigning
to
be
heavy
with
sleep
gave
a
quiet
little
sigh
and
slipped
into
his
arms
what
was
it
dear
nothing
he
answered
his
voice
still
shaken
i
thought
there
was
somebody
at
the
window
so
i
looked
out
but
i
could
see
any
one
and
the
noise
kept
up
so
i
phoned
sorry
if
i
disturbed
you
but
i
awfully
darn
nervous
catching
the
lie
she
gave
an
interior
start
he
had
not
gone
to
the
window
nor
near
the
window
he
had
stood
by
the
bed
and
then
sent
in
his
call
of
fear
oh
she
said
and
then
i
so
sleepy
for
an
hour
they
lay
awake
side
by
side
gloria
with
her
eyes
shut
so
tight
that
blue
moons
formed
and
revolved
against
backgrounds
of
deepest
mauve
anthony
staring
blindly
into
the
darkness
overhead
after
many
weeks
it
came
gradually
out
into
the
light
to
be
laughed
and
joked
at
they
made
a
tradition
to
fit
over
it
whenever
that
overpowering
terror
of
the
night
attacked
anthony
she
would
put
her
arms
about
him
and
croon
soft
as
a
song
i
protect
my
anthony
oh
nobody
ever
going
to
harm
my
anthony
he
would
laugh
as
though
it
were
a
jest
they
played
for
their
mutual
amusement
but
to
gloria
it
was
never
quite
a
jest
it
was
at
first
a
keen
disappointment
later
it
was
one
of
the
times
when
she
controlled
her
temper
the
management
of
gloria
temper
whether
it
was
aroused
by
a
lack
of
hot
water
for
her
bath
or
by
a
skirmish
with
her
husband
became
almost
the
primary
duty
of
anthony
day
it
must
be
done
just
so
by
this
much
silence
by
that
much
pressure
by
this
much
yielding
by
that
much
force
it
was
in
her
angers
with
their
attendant
cruelties
that
her
inordinate
egotism
chiefly
displayed
itself
because
she
was
brave
because
she
was
spoiled
because
of
her
outrageous
and
commendable
independence
of
judgment
and
finally
because
of
her
arrogant
consciousness
that
she
had
never
seen
a
girl
as
beautiful
as
herself
gloria
had
developed
into
a
consistent
practising
nietzschean
this
of
course
with
overtones
of
profound
sentiment
there
was
for
example
her
stomach
she
was
used
to
certain
dishes
and
she
had
a
strong
conviction
that
she
could
not
possibly
eat
anything
else
there
must
be
a
lemonade
and
a
tomato
sandwich
late
in
the
morning
then
a
light
lunch
with
a
stuffed
tomato
not
only
did
she
require
food
from
a
selection
of
a
dozen
dishes
but
in
addition
this
food
must
be
prepared
in
just
a
certain
way
one
of
the
most
annoying
half
hours
of
the
first
fortnight
occurred
in
los
angeles
when
an
unhappy
waiter
brought
her
a
tomato
stuffed
with
chicken
salad
instead
of
celery
we
always
serve
it
that
way
madame
he
quavered
to
the
gray
eyes
that
regarded
him
wrathfully
gloria
made
no
answer
but
when
the
waiter
had
turned
discreetly
away
she
banged
both
fists
upon
the
table
until
the
china
and
silver
rattled
poor
gloria
laughed
anthony
unwittingly
you
ca
get
what
you
want
ever
can
you
i
ca
eat
she
flared
up
i
call
back
the
waiter
i
do
want
you
to
he
does
know
anything
the
darn
well
it
is
the
hotel
fault
either
send
it
back
forget
it
or
be
a
sport
and
eat
it
shut
up
she
said
succinctly
why
take
it
out
on
me
oh
i
she
wailed
but
i
simply
eat
it
anthony
subsided
helplessly
we
go
somewhere
else
he
suggested
i
do
to
go
anywhere
else
i
tired
of
being
trotted
around
to
a
dozen
cafés
and
not
getting
fit
to
eat
when
did
we
go
around
to
a
dozen
cafés
you
to
in
town
insisted
gloria
with
ready
sophistry
anthony
bewildered
tried
another
tack
why
do
you
try
to
eat
it
it
ca
be
as
bad
as
you
think
just
because
i
do
like
chicken
she
picked
up
her
fork
and
began
poking
contemptuously
at
the
tomato
and
anthony
expected
her
to
begin
flinging
the
stuffings
in
all
directions
he
was
sure
that
she
was
approximately
as
angry
as
she
had
ever
been
for
an
instant
he
had
detected
a
spark
of
hate
directed
as
much
toward
him
as
toward
any
one
else
and
gloria
angry
was
for
the
present
unapproachable
then
surprisingly
he
saw
that
she
had
tentatively
raised
the
fork
to
her
lips
and
tasted
the
chicken
salad
her
frown
had
not
abated
and
he
stared
at
her
anxiously
making
no
comment
and
daring
scarcely
to
breathe
she
tasted
another
forkful
in
another
moment
she
was
eating
with
difficulty
anthony
restrained
a
chuckle
when
at
length
he
spoke
his
words
had
no
possible
connection
with
chicken
salad
this
incident
with
variations
ran
like
a
lugubrious
fugue
through
the
first
year
of
marriage
always
it
left
anthony
baffled
irritated
and
depressed
but
another
rough
brushing
of
temperaments
a
question
of
he
found
even
more
annoying
as
it
ended
inevitably
in
a
decisive
defeat
for
him
one
afternoon
in
coronado
where
they
made
the
longest
stay
of
their
trip
more
than
three
weeks
gloria
was
arraying
herself
brilliantly
for
tea
anthony
who
had
been
listening
to
the
latest
rumor
bulletins
of
war
in
europe
entered
the
room
kissed
the
back
of
her
powdered
neck
and
went
to
his
dresser
after
a
great
pulling
out
and
pushing
in
of
drawers
evidently
unsatisfactory
he
turned
around
to
the
unfinished
masterpiece
got
any
handkerchiefs
gloria
he
asked
gloria
shook
her
golden
head
not
a
one
i
using
one
of
yours
the
last
one
i
deduce
he
laughed
dryly
is
it
she
applied
an
emphatic
though
very
delicate
contour
to
her
lips
is
the
laundry
back
i
do
know
anthony
hesitated
then
with
sudden
discernment
opened
the
closet
door
his
suspicions
were
verified
on
the
hook
provided
hung
the
blue
bag
furnished
by
the
hotel
this
was
full
of
his
clothes
he
had
put
them
there
himself
the
floor
beneath
it
was
littered
with
an
astonishing
mass
of
finery
lingerie
stockings
dresses
nightgowns
and
pajamas
most
of
it
scarcely
worn
but
all
of
it
coming
indubitably
under
the
general
heading
of
gloria
laundry
he
stood
holding
the
closet
door
open
why
gloria
what
the
lip
line
was
being
erased
and
corrected
according
to
some
mysterious
perspective
not
a
finger
trembled
as
she
manipulated
the
not
a
glance
wavered
in
his
direction
it
was
a
triumph
of
concentration
have
you
ever
sent
out
the
laundry
is
it
there
it
most
certainly
is
well
i
guess
i
have
then
gloria
began
anthony
sitting
down
on
the
bed
and
trying
to
catch
her
mirrored
eyes
you
a
nice
fellow
you
are
i
sent
it
out
every
time
it
been
sent
since
we
left
new
york
and
over
a
week
ago
you
promised
you
do
it
for
a
change
all
you
have
to
do
would
be
to
cram
your
own
junk
into
that
bag
and
ring
for
the
chambermaid
oh
why
fuss
about
the
laundry
exclaimed
gloria
petulantly
take
care
of
it
i
have
fussed
about
it
i
just
as
soon
divide
the
bother
with
you
but
when
we
run
out
of
handkerchiefs
it
darn
near
time
something
done
anthony
considered
that
he
was
being
extraordinarily
logical
but
gloria
unimpressed
put
away
her
cosmetics
and
casually
offered
him
her
back
hook
me
up
she
suggested
anthony
dearest
i
forgot
all
about
it
i
meant
to
honestly
and
i
will
do
be
cross
with
your
sweetheart
what
could
anthony
do
then
but
draw
her
down
upon
his
knee
and
kiss
a
shade
of
color
from
her
lips
but
i
do
mind
she
murmured
with
a
smile
radiant
and
magnanimous
you
can
kiss
all
the
paint
off
my
lips
any
time
you
want
they
went
down
to
tea
they
bought
some
handkerchiefs
in
a
notion
store
near
by
all
was
forgotten
but
two
days
later
anthony
looked
in
the
closet
and
saw
the
bag
still
hung
limp
upon
its
hook
and
that
the
gay
and
vivid
pile
on
the
floor
had
increased
surprisingly
in
height
gloria
he
cried
oh
her
voice
was
full
of
real
distress
despairingly
anthony
went
to
the
phone
and
called
the
chambermaid
it
seems
to
me
he
said
impatiently
that
you
expect
me
to
be
some
sort
of
french
valet
to
you
gloria
laughed
so
infectiously
that
anthony
was
unwise
enough
to
smile
unfortunate
man
in
some
intangible
manner
his
smile
made
her
mistress
of
the
situation
with
an
air
of
injured
righteousness
she
went
emphatically
to
the
closet
and
began
pushing
her
laundry
violently
into
the
bag
anthony
watched
her
ashamed
of
himself
there
she
said
implying
that
her
fingers
had
been
worked
to
the
bone
by
a
brutal
taskmaster
he
considered
nevertheless
that
he
had
given
her
an
and
that
the
matter
was
closed
but
on
the
contrary
it
was
merely
beginning
laundry
pile
followed
laundry
pile
at
long
intervals
dearth
of
handkerchief
followed
dearth
of
handkerchief
at
short
ones
not
to
mention
dearth
of
sock
of
shirt
of
everything
and
anthony
found
at
length
that
either
he
must
send
it
out
himself
or
go
through
the
increasingly
unpleasant
ordeal
of
a
verbal
battle
with
gloria
gloria
and
general
lee
on
their
way
east
they
stopped
two
days
in
washington
strolling
about
with
some
hostility
in
its
atmosphere
of
harsh
repellent
light
of
distance
without
freedom
of
pomp
without
splendor
it
seemed
a
and
city
the
second
day
they
made
an
trip
to
general
lee
old
home
at
arlington
the
bus
which
bore
them
was
crowded
with
hot
unprosperous
people
and
anthony
intimate
to
gloria
felt
a
storm
brewing
it
broke
at
the
zoo
where
the
party
stopped
for
ten
minutes
the
zoo
it
seemed
smelt
of
monkeys
anthony
laughed
gloria
called
down
the
curse
of
heaven
upon
monkeys
including
in
her
malevolence
all
the
passengers
of
the
bus
and
their
perspiring
offspring
who
had
hied
themselves
eventually
the
bus
moved
on
to
arlington
there
it
met
other
busses
and
immediately
a
swarm
of
women
and
children
were
leaving
a
trail
of
through
the
halls
of
general
lee
and
crowding
at
length
into
the
room
where
he
was
married
on
the
wall
of
this
room
a
pleasing
sign
announced
in
large
red
letters
ladies
toilet
at
this
final
blow
gloria
broke
down
i
think
it
perfectly
terrible
she
said
furiously
the
idea
of
letting
these
people
come
here
and
of
encouraging
them
by
making
these
houses
well
objected
anthony
if
they
were
kept
up
they
go
to
pieces
what
if
they
did
she
exclaimed
as
they
sought
the
wide
pillared
porch
do
you
think
they
left
a
breath
of
here
this
has
become
a
thing
of
do
you
want
to
preserve
old
things
but
you
anthony
beautiful
things
grow
to
a
certain
height
and
then
they
fail
and
fade
off
breathing
out
memories
as
they
decay
and
just
as
any
period
decays
in
our
minds
the
things
of
that
period
should
decay
too
and
in
that
way
they
preserved
for
a
while
in
the
few
hearts
like
mine
that
react
to
them
that
graveyard
at
tarrytown
for
instance
the
asses
who
give
money
to
preserve
things
have
spoiled
that
too
sleepy
hollow
gone
washington
irving
dead
and
his
books
are
rotting
in
our
estimation
year
by
year
then
let
the
graveyard
rot
too
as
it
should
as
all
things
should
trying
to
preserve
a
century
by
keeping
its
relics
up
to
date
is
like
keeping
a
dying
man
alive
by
stimulants
so
you
think
that
just
as
a
time
goes
to
pieces
its
houses
ought
to
go
too
of
course
would
you
value
your
keats
letter
if
the
signature
was
traced
over
to
make
it
last
longer
it
just
because
i
love
the
past
that
i
want
this
house
to
look
back
on
its
glamourous
moment
of
youth
and
beauty
and
i
want
its
stairs
to
creak
as
if
to
the
footsteps
of
women
with
hoop
skirts
and
men
in
boots
and
spurs
but
they
made
it
into
a
blondined
old
woman
of
sixty
it
has
any
right
to
look
so
prosperous
it
might
care
enough
for
lee
to
drop
a
brick
now
and
then
how
many
of
these
these
she
waved
her
hand
around
get
anything
from
this
for
all
the
histories
and
and
restorations
in
existence
how
many
of
them
who
think
that
at
best
appreciation
is
talking
in
undertones
and
walking
on
tiptoes
would
even
come
here
if
it
was
any
trouble
i
want
it
to
smell
of
magnolias
instead
of
peanuts
and
i
want
my
shoes
to
crunch
on
the
same
gravel
that
boots
crunched
on
there
no
beauty
without
poignancy
and
there
no
poignancy
without
the
feeling
that
it
going
men
names
books
houses
bound
for
dust
mortal
a
small
boy
appeared
beside
them
and
swinging
a
handful
of
flung
them
valiantly
in
the
direction
of
the
potomac
sentiment
simultaneously
with
the
fall
of
liège
anthony
and
gloria
arrived
in
new
york
in
retrospect
the
six
weeks
seemed
miraculously
happy
they
had
found
to
a
great
extent
as
most
young
couples
find
in
some
measure
that
they
possessed
in
common
many
fixed
ideas
and
curiosities
and
odd
quirks
of
mind
they
were
essentially
companionable
but
it
had
been
a
struggle
to
keep
many
of
their
conversations
on
the
level
of
discussions
arguments
were
fatal
to
gloria
disposition
she
had
all
her
life
been
associated
either
with
her
mental
inferiors
or
with
men
who
under
the
almost
hostile
intimidation
of
her
beauty
had
not
dared
to
contradict
her
naturally
then
it
irritated
her
when
anthony
emerged
from
the
state
in
which
her
pronouncements
were
an
infallible
and
ultimate
decision
he
failed
to
realize
at
first
that
this
was
the
result
partly
of
her
female
education
and
partly
of
her
beauty
and
he
was
inclined
to
include
her
with
her
entire
sex
as
curiously
and
definitely
limited
it
maddened
him
to
find
she
had
no
sense
of
justice
but
he
discovered
that
when
a
subject
did
interest
her
her
brain
tired
less
quickly
than
his
what
he
chiefly
missed
in
her
mind
was
the
pedantic
teleology
the
sense
of
order
and
accuracy
the
sense
of
life
as
a
mysteriously
correlated
piece
of
patchwork
but
he
understood
after
a
while
that
such
a
quality
in
her
would
have
been
incongruous
of
the
things
they
possessed
in
common
greatest
of
all
was
their
almost
uncanny
pull
at
each
other
hearts
the
day
they
left
the
hotel
in
coronado
she
sat
down
on
one
of
the
beds
while
they
were
packing
and
began
to
weep
bitterly
dearest
his
arms
were
around
her
he
pulled
her
head
down
upon
his
shoulder
what
is
it
my
own
gloria
tell
me
we
going
away
she
sobbed
oh
anthony
it
sort
of
the
first
place
we
lived
together
our
two
little
beds
here
side
by
side
they
be
always
waiting
for
us
and
we
never
coming
back
to
any
more
she
was
tearing
at
his
heart
as
she
always
could
sentiment
came
over
him
rushed
into
his
eyes
gloria
why
we
going
on
to
another
room
and
two
other
little
beds
we
going
to
be
together
all
our
lives
words
flooded
from
her
in
a
low
husky
voice
but
it
wo
be
like
our
two
beds
ever
again
everywhere
we
go
and
move
on
and
change
something
lost
something
left
behind
you
ever
quite
repeat
anything
and
i
been
so
yours
here
he
held
her
passionately
near
discerning
far
beyond
any
criticism
of
her
sentiment
a
wise
grasping
of
the
minute
if
only
an
indulgence
of
her
desire
to
cry
gloria
the
idler
caresser
of
her
own
dreams
extracting
poignancy
from
the
memorable
things
of
life
and
youth
later
in
the
afternoon
when
he
returned
from
the
station
with
the
tickets
he
found
her
asleep
on
one
of
the
beds
her
arm
curled
about
a
black
object
which
he
could
not
at
first
identify
coming
closer
he
found
it
was
one
of
his
shoes
not
a
particularly
new
one
nor
clean
one
but
her
face
was
pressed
against
it
and
he
understood
her
ancient
and
most
honorable
message
there
was
almost
ecstasy
in
waking
her
and
seeing
her
smile
at
him
shy
but
well
aware
of
her
own
nicety
of
imagination
with
no
appraisal
of
the
worth
or
dross
of
these
two
things
it
seemed
to
anthony
that
they
lay
somewhere
near
the
heart
of
love
the
gray
house
it
is
in
the
twenties
that
the
actual
momentum
of
life
begins
to
slacken
and
it
is
a
simple
soul
indeed
to
whom
as
many
things
are
significant
and
meaningful
at
thirty
as
at
ten
years
before
at
thirty
an
is
a
more
or
less
man
who
grinds
an
organ
and
once
he
was
an
the
unmistakable
stigma
of
humanity
touches
all
those
impersonal
and
beautiful
things
that
only
youth
ever
grasps
in
their
impersonal
glory
a
brilliant
ball
gay
with
light
romantic
laughter
wears
through
its
own
silks
and
satins
to
show
the
bare
framework
of
a
thing
oh
that
eternal
hand
a
play
most
tragic
and
most
divine
becomes
merely
a
succession
of
speeches
sweated
over
by
the
eternal
plagiarist
in
the
clammy
hours
and
acted
by
men
subject
to
cramps
cowardice
and
manly
sentiment
and
this
time
with
gloria
and
anthony
this
first
year
of
marriage
and
the
gray
house
caught
them
in
that
stage
when
the
was
slowly
undergoing
his
inevitable
metamorphosis
she
was
he
was
the
gray
house
was
at
first
of
sheerly
pastoral
intent
they
lived
impatiently
in
anthony
apartment
for
the
first
fortnight
after
the
return
from
california
in
a
stifled
atmosphere
of
open
trunks
too
many
callers
and
the
eternal
they
discussed
with
their
friends
the
stupendous
problem
of
their
future
dick
and
maury
would
sit
with
them
agreeing
solemnly
almost
thoughtfully
as
anthony
ran
through
his
list
of
what
they
ought
to
do
and
where
they
ought
to
live
i
like
to
take
gloria
abroad
he
complained
except
for
this
damn
war
and
next
to
that
i
sort
of
like
to
have
a
place
in
the
country
somewhere
near
new
york
of
course
where
i
could
write
or
whatever
i
decide
to
do
gloria
laughed
is
he
cute
she
required
of
maury
he
decides
to
do
but
what
am
going
to
do
if
he
works
maury
will
you
take
me
around
if
anthony
works
anyway
i
not
going
to
work
yet
said
anthony
quickly
it
was
vaguely
understood
between
them
that
on
some
misty
day
he
would
enter
a
sort
of
glorified
diplomatic
service
and
be
envied
by
princes
and
prime
ministers
for
his
beautiful
wife
well
said
gloria
helplessly
i
sure
i
do
know
we
talk
and
talk
and
never
get
anywhere
and
we
ask
all
our
friends
and
they
just
answer
the
way
we
want
to
i
wish
somebody
take
care
of
us
why
do
you
go
out
to
out
to
greenwich
or
something
suggested
richard
caramel
i
like
that
said
gloria
brightening
do
you
think
we
could
get
a
house
there
dick
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
maury
laughed
you
two
amuse
me
he
said
of
all
the
unpractical
people
as
soon
as
a
place
is
mentioned
you
expect
us
to
pull
great
piles
of
photographs
out
of
our
pockets
showing
the
different
styles
of
architecture
available
in
bungalows
that
just
what
i
do
want
wailed
gloria
a
hot
stuffy
bungalow
with
a
lot
of
babies
next
door
and
their
father
cutting
the
grass
in
his
shirt
sleeves
for
heaven
sake
gloria
interrupted
maury
nobody
wants
to
lock
you
up
in
a
bungalow
who
in
god
name
brought
bungalows
into
the
conversation
but
you
never
get
a
place
anywhere
unless
you
go
out
and
hunt
for
it
go
where
you
say
out
and
hunt
for
it
but
where
with
dignity
maury
waved
his
hand
about
the
room
out
anywhere
out
in
the
country
there
lots
of
places
thanks
look
here
richard
caramel
brought
his
yellow
eye
rakishly
into
play
the
trouble
with
you
two
is
that
you
all
disorganized
do
you
know
anything
about
new
york
state
shut
up
anthony
i
talking
to
gloria
well
she
admitted
finally
i
been
to
two
or
three
house
parties
in
portchester
and
around
in
connecticut
but
of
course
that
is
in
new
york
state
is
it
and
neither
is
morristown
she
finished
with
drowsy
irrelevance
there
was
a
shout
of
laughter
oh
lord
cried
dick
neither
is
morristown
no
and
neither
is
santa
barbara
gloria
now
listen
to
begin
with
unless
you
have
a
fortune
there
no
use
considering
any
place
like
newport
or
southhampton
or
tuxedo
they
out
of
the
question
they
all
agreed
to
this
solemnly
and
personally
i
hate
new
jersey
then
of
course
there
upper
new
york
above
tuxedo
too
cold
said
gloria
briefly
i
was
there
once
in
an
automobile
well
it
seems
to
me
there
a
lot
of
towns
like
rye
between
new
york
and
greenwich
where
you
could
buy
a
little
gray
house
of
some
gloria
leaped
at
the
phrase
triumphantly
for
the
first
time
since
their
return
east
she
knew
what
she
wanted
oh
she
cried
oh
that
it
a
little
gray
house
with
sort
of
white
around
and
a
whole
lot
of
swamp
maples
just
as
brown
and
gold
as
an
october
picture
in
a
gallery
where
can
we
find
one
unfortunately
i
mislaid
my
list
of
little
gray
houses
with
swamp
maples
around
them
but
i
try
to
find
it
meanwhile
you
take
a
piece
of
paper
and
write
down
the
names
of
seven
possible
towns
and
every
day
this
week
you
take
a
trip
to
one
of
those
towns
oh
gosh
protested
gloria
collapsing
mentally
why
wo
you
do
it
for
us
i
hate
trains
well
hire
a
car
and
gloria
yawned
i
tired
of
discussing
it
seems
to
me
all
we
do
is
talk
about
where
to
live
my
exquisite
wife
wearies
of
thought
remarked
anthony
ironically
she
must
have
a
tomato
sandwich
to
stimulate
her
jaded
nerves
let
go
out
to
tea
as
the
unfortunate
upshot
of
this
conversation
they
took
dick
advice
literally
and
two
days
later
went
out
to
rye
where
they
wandered
around
with
an
irritated
real
estate
agent
like
bewildered
babes
in
the
wood
they
were
shown
houses
at
a
hundred
a
month
which
closely
adjoined
other
houses
at
a
hundred
a
month
they
were
shown
isolated
houses
to
which
they
invariably
took
violent
dislikes
though
they
submitted
weakly
to
the
agent
desire
that
they
look
at
that
stove
some
stove
and
to
a
great
shaking
of
doorposts
and
tapping
of
walls
intended
evidently
to
show
that
the
house
would
not
immediately
collapse
no
matter
how
convincingly
it
gave
that
impression
they
gazed
through
windows
into
interiors
furnished
either
commercially
with
chairs
and
unyielding
settees
or
with
the
melancholy
of
other
summers
crossed
tennis
rackets
couches
and
depressing
gibson
girls
with
a
feeling
of
guilt
they
looked
at
a
few
really
nice
houses
aloof
dignified
and
cool
at
three
hundred
a
month
they
went
away
from
rye
thanking
the
real
estate
agent
very
much
indeed
on
the
crowded
train
back
to
new
york
the
seat
behind
was
occupied
by
a
latin
whose
last
few
meals
had
obviously
been
composed
entirely
of
garlic
they
reached
the
apartment
gratefully
almost
hysterically
and
gloria
rushed
for
a
hot
bath
in
the
reproachless
bathroom
so
far
as
the
question
of
a
future
abode
was
concerned
both
of
them
were
incapacitated
for
a
week
the
matter
eventually
worked
itself
out
with
romance
anthony
ran
into
the
living
room
one
afternoon
fairly
radiating
the
idea
i
got
it
he
was
exclaiming
as
though
he
had
just
caught
a
mouse
we
get
a
car
gee
whiz
have
we
got
troubles
enough
taking
care
of
ourselves
give
me
a
second
to
explain
ca
you
just
let
leave
our
stuff
with
dick
and
just
pile
a
couple
of
suitcases
in
our
car
the
one
we
going
to
buy
we
have
to
have
one
in
the
country
anyway
and
just
start
out
in
the
direction
of
new
haven
you
see
as
we
get
out
of
commuting
distance
from
new
york
the
rents
get
cheaper
and
as
soon
as
we
find
a
house
we
want
we
just
settle
down
by
his
frequent
and
soothing
interpolation
of
the
word
just
he
aroused
her
lethargic
enthusiasm
strutting
violently
about
the
room
he
simulated
a
dynamic
and
irresistible
efficiency
we
buy
a
car
life
limping
after
imagination
boots
saw
them
out
of
town
a
week
later
in
a
cheap
but
sparkling
new
roadster
saw
them
through
the
chaotic
unintelligible
bronx
then
over
a
wide
murky
district
which
alternated
cheerless
wastes
with
suburbs
of
tremendous
and
sordid
activity
they
left
new
york
at
eleven
and
it
was
well
past
a
hot
and
beatific
noon
when
they
moved
rakishly
through
pelham
these
are
towns
said
gloria
scornfully
these
are
just
city
blocks
plumped
down
coldly
into
waste
acres
i
imagine
all
the
men
here
have
their
mustaches
stained
from
drinking
their
coffee
too
quickly
in
the
morning
and
play
pinochle
on
the
commuting
trains
what
pinochle
do
be
so
literal
how
should
i
know
but
it
sounds
as
though
they
ought
to
play
it
i
like
it
it
sounds
as
if
it
were
something
where
you
sort
of
cracked
your
knuckles
or
something
let
me
drive
anthony
looked
at
her
suspiciously
you
swear
you
a
good
driver
since
i
was
fourteen
he
stopped
the
car
cautiously
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
they
changed
seats
then
with
a
horrible
grinding
noise
the
car
was
put
in
gear
gloria
adding
an
accompaniment
of
laughter
which
seemed
to
anthony
disquieting
and
in
the
worst
possible
taste
here
we
go
she
yelled
their
heads
snapped
back
like
marionettes
on
a
single
wire
as
the
car
leaped
ahead
and
curved
retchingly
about
a
standing
whose
driver
stood
up
on
his
seat
and
bellowed
after
them
in
the
immemorial
tradition
of
the
road
anthony
retorted
with
a
few
brief
epigrams
as
to
the
grossness
of
the
profession
he
cut
his
remarks
short
however
and
turned
to
gloria
with
the
growing
conviction
that
he
had
made
a
grave
mistake
in
relinquishing
control
and
that
gloria
was
a
driver
of
many
eccentricities
and
of
infinite
carelessness
remember
now
he
warned
her
nervously
the
man
said
we
ought
to
go
over
twenty
miles
an
hour
for
the
first
five
thousand
miles
she
nodded
briefly
but
evidently
intending
to
accomplish
the
prohibitive
distance
as
quickly
as
possible
slightly
increased
her
speed
a
moment
later
he
made
another
attempt
see
that
sign
do
you
want
to
get
us
pinched
oh
for
heaven
sake
cried
gloria
in
exasperation
you
exaggerate
things
so
well
i
do
want
to
get
arrested
who
arresting
you
you
so
persistent
just
like
you
were
about
my
cough
medicine
last
night
it
was
for
your
own
good
ha
i
might
as
well
be
living
with
mama
what
a
thing
to
say
to
me
a
standing
policeman
swerved
into
view
was
hastily
passed
see
him
demanded
anthony
oh
you
drive
me
crazy
he
did
arrest
us
did
he
when
he
does
it
be
too
late
countered
anthony
brilliantly
her
reply
was
scornful
almost
injured
why
this
old
thing
wo
over
it
is
old
it
is
in
spirit
that
afternoon
the
car
joined
the
and
gloria
appetite
as
one
of
the
trinity
of
contention
he
warned
her
of
railroad
tracks
he
pointed
out
approaching
automobiles
finally
he
insisted
on
taking
the
wheel
and
a
furious
insulted
gloria
sat
silently
beside
him
between
the
towns
of
larchmont
and
rye
but
it
was
due
to
this
furious
silence
of
hers
that
the
gray
house
materialized
from
its
abstraction
for
just
beyond
rye
he
surrendered
gloomily
to
it
and
the
wheel
mutely
he
beseeched
her
and
gloria
instantly
cheered
vowed
to
be
more
careful
but
because
a
discourteous
persisted
callously
in
remaining
upon
its
track
gloria
ducked
down
a
and
thereafter
that
afternoon
was
never
able
to
find
her
way
back
to
the
post
road
the
street
they
finally
mistook
for
it
lost
its
aspect
when
it
had
gone
five
miles
from
cos
cob
its
macadam
became
gravel
then
dirt
moreover
it
narrowed
and
developed
a
border
of
maple
trees
through
which
filtered
the
weltering
sun
making
its
endless
experiments
with
shadow
designs
upon
the
long
grass
we
lost
now
complained
anthony
read
that
sign
marietta
five
miles
what
marietta
never
heard
of
it
but
let
go
on
we
ca
turn
here
and
probably
a
detour
back
to
the
post
road
the
way
became
scarred
with
deepening
ruts
and
insidious
shoulders
of
stone
three
farmhouses
faced
them
momentarily
slid
by
a
town
sprang
up
in
a
cluster
of
dull
roofs
around
a
white
tall
steeple
then
gloria
hesitating
between
two
approaches
and
making
her
choice
too
late
drove
over
a
and
ripped
the
transmission
violently
from
the
car
it
was
dark
when
the
agent
of
marietta
showed
them
the
gray
house
they
came
upon
it
just
west
of
the
village
where
it
rested
against
a
sky
that
was
a
warm
blue
cloak
buttoned
with
tiny
stars
the
gray
house
had
been
there
when
women
who
kept
cats
were
probably
witches
when
paul
revere
made
false
teeth
in
boston
preparatory
to
arousing
the
great
commercial
people
when
our
ancestors
were
gloriously
deserting
washington
in
droves
since
those
days
the
house
had
been
bolstered
up
in
a
feeble
corner
considerably
repartitioned
and
newly
plastered
inside
amplified
by
a
kitchen
and
added
to
by
a
but
save
for
where
some
jovial
oaf
had
roofed
the
new
kitchen
with
red
tin
colonial
it
defiantly
remained
how
did
you
happen
to
come
to
marietta
demanded
the
agent
in
a
tone
that
was
first
cousin
to
suspicion
he
was
showing
them
through
four
spacious
and
airy
bedrooms
we
broke
down
explained
gloria
i
drove
over
a
and
we
had
ourselves
towed
to
the
garage
and
then
we
saw
your
sign
the
man
nodded
unable
to
follow
such
a
sally
of
spontaneity
there
was
something
subtly
immoral
in
doing
anything
without
several
consideration
they
signed
a
lease
that
night
and
in
the
agent
car
returned
jubilantly
to
the
somnolent
and
dilapidated
marietta
inn
which
was
too
broken
for
even
the
chance
immoralities
and
consequent
gaieties
of
a
country
half
the
night
they
lay
awake
planning
the
things
they
were
to
do
there
anthony
was
going
to
work
at
an
astounding
pace
on
his
history
and
thus
ingratiate
himself
with
his
cynical
grandfather
when
the
car
was
repaired
they
would
explore
the
country
and
join
the
nearest
really
nice
club
where
gloria
would
play
golf
or
something
while
anthony
wrote
this
of
course
was
idea
gloria
was
sure
she
wanted
but
to
read
and
dream
and
be
fed
tomato
sandwiches
and
lemonades
by
some
angelic
servant
still
in
a
shadowy
hinterland
between
paragraphs
anthony
would
come
and
kiss
her
as
she
lay
indolently
in
the
hammock
the
hammock
a
host
of
new
dreams
in
tune
to
its
imagined
rhythm
while
the
wind
stirred
it
and
waves
of
sun
undulated
over
the
shadows
of
blown
wheat
or
the
dusty
road
freckled
and
darkened
with
quiet
summer
rain
and
guests
here
they
had
a
long
argument
both
of
them
trying
to
be
extraordinarily
mature
and
anthony
claimed
that
they
would
need
people
at
least
every
other
as
a
sort
of
change
this
provoked
an
involved
and
extremely
sentimental
conversation
as
to
whether
anthony
did
not
consider
gloria
change
enough
though
he
assured
her
that
he
did
she
insisted
upon
doubting
him
eventually
the
conversation
assumed
its
eternal
monotone
what
then
oh
what
we
do
then
well
we
have
a
dog
suggested
anthony
i
do
want
one
i
want
a
kitty
she
went
thoroughly
and
with
great
enthusiasm
into
the
history
habits
and
tastes
of
a
cat
she
had
once
possessed
anthony
considered
that
it
must
have
been
a
horrible
character
with
neither
personal
magnetism
nor
a
loyal
heart
later
they
slept
to
wake
an
hour
before
dawn
with
the
gray
house
dancing
in
phantom
glory
before
their
dazzled
eyes
the
soul
of
gloria
for
that
autumn
the
gray
house
welcomed
them
with
a
rush
of
sentiment
that
falsified
its
cynical
old
age
true
there
were
the
there
was
gloria
appetite
there
was
anthony
tendency
to
brood
and
his
imaginative
nervousness
but
there
were
intervals
also
of
an
serenity
close
together
on
the
porch
they
would
wait
for
the
moon
to
stream
across
the
silver
acres
of
farmland
jump
a
thick
wood
and
tumble
waves
of
radiance
at
their
feet
in
such
a
moonlight
gloria
face
was
of
a
pervading
reminiscent
white
and
with
a
modicum
of
effort
they
would
slip
off
the
blinders
of
custom
and
each
would
find
in
the
other
almost
the
quintessential
romance
of
the
vanished
june
one
night
while
her
head
lay
upon
his
heart
and
their
cigarettes
glowed
in
swerving
buttons
of
light
through
the
dome
of
darkness
over
the
bed
she
spoke
for
the
first
time
and
fragmentarily
of
the
men
who
had
hung
for
brief
moments
on
her
beauty
do
you
ever
think
of
them
he
asked
her
only
occasionally
when
something
happens
that
recalls
a
particular
man
what
do
you
remember
their
kisses
all
sorts
of
things
men
are
different
with
women
different
in
what
way
oh
entirely
and
quite
inexpressibly
men
who
had
the
most
firmly
rooted
reputation
for
being
this
way
or
that
would
sometimes
be
surprisingly
inconsistent
with
me
brutal
men
were
tender
negligible
men
were
astonishingly
loyal
and
lovable
and
often
honorable
men
took
attitudes
that
were
anything
but
honorable
for
instance
well
there
was
a
boy
named
percy
wolcott
from
cornell
who
was
quite
a
hero
in
college
a
great
athlete
and
saved
a
lot
of
people
from
a
fire
or
something
like
that
but
i
soon
found
he
was
stupid
in
a
rather
dangerous
way
what
way
it
seems
he
had
some
naïve
conception
of
a
woman
to
be
his
wife
a
particular
conception
that
i
used
to
run
into
a
lot
and
that
always
drove
me
wild
he
demanded
a
girl
who
never
been
kissed
and
who
liked
to
sew
and
sit
home
and
pay
tribute
to
his
and
i
bet
a
hat
if
he
gotten
an
idiot
to
sit
and
be
stupid
with
him
he
tearing
out
on
the
side
with
some
much
speedier
lady
i
be
sorry
for
his
wife
i
would
think
what
an
ass
she
be
not
to
realize
it
before
she
married
him
he
the
sort
whose
idea
of
honoring
and
respecting
a
woman
would
be
never
to
give
her
any
excitement
with
the
best
intentions
he
was
deep
in
the
dark
ages
what
was
his
attitude
toward
you
i
coming
to
that
as
i
told
you
or
did
i
tell
you
he
was
mighty
big
brown
honest
eyes
and
one
of
those
smiles
that
guarantee
the
heart
behind
it
is
gold
being
young
and
credulous
i
thought
he
had
some
discretion
so
i
kissed
him
fervently
one
night
when
we
were
riding
around
after
a
dance
at
the
homestead
at
hot
springs
it
had
been
a
wonderful
week
i
remember
with
the
most
luscious
trees
spread
like
green
lather
sort
of
all
over
the
valley
and
a
mist
rising
out
of
them
on
october
mornings
like
bonfires
lit
to
turn
them
brown
how
about
your
friend
with
the
ideals
interrupted
anthony
it
seems
that
when
he
kissed
me
he
began
to
think
that
perhaps
he
could
get
away
with
a
little
more
that
i
need
be
like
this
beatrice
fairfax
of
his
imagination
what
he
do
not
much
i
pushed
him
off
a
embankment
before
he
was
well
started
hurt
him
inquired
anthony
with
a
laugh
broke
his
arm
and
sprained
his
ankle
he
told
the
story
all
over
hot
springs
and
when
his
arm
healed
a
man
named
barley
who
liked
me
fought
him
and
broke
it
over
again
oh
it
was
all
an
awful
mess
he
threatened
to
sue
barley
and
barley
he
was
from
georgia
was
seen
buying
a
gun
in
town
but
before
that
mama
had
dragged
me
north
again
much
against
my
will
so
i
never
did
find
out
all
that
happened
though
i
saw
barley
once
in
the
vanderbilt
lobby
anthony
laughed
long
and
loud
what
a
career
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
furious
because
you
kissed
so
many
men
i
not
though
at
this
she
sat
up
in
bed
it
funny
but
i
so
sure
that
those
kisses
left
no
mark
on
me
no
taint
of
promiscuity
i
mean
even
though
a
man
once
told
me
in
all
seriousness
that
he
hated
to
think
i
been
a
public
drinking
glass
he
had
his
nerve
i
just
laughed
and
told
him
to
think
of
me
rather
as
a
that
goes
from
hand
to
hand
but
should
be
valued
none
the
less
somehow
it
does
bother
me
on
the
other
hand
it
would
of
course
if
you
done
any
more
than
kiss
them
but
i
believe
absolutely
incapable
of
jealousy
except
as
hurt
vanity
why
do
you
care
what
i
done
would
you
prefer
it
if
i
been
absolutely
innocent
it
all
in
the
impression
it
might
have
made
on
you
kisses
were
because
the
man
was
or
because
there
was
a
slick
moon
or
even
because
i
felt
vaguely
sentimental
and
a
little
stirred
but
that
all
it
had
utterly
no
effect
on
me
but
you
remember
and
let
memories
haunt
you
and
worry
you
have
you
ever
kissed
any
one
like
you
kissed
me
no
she
answered
simply
as
i
told
you
men
have
tried
oh
lots
of
things
any
pretty
girl
has
that
experience
you
see
she
resumed
it
does
matter
to
me
how
many
women
you
stayed
with
in
the
past
so
long
as
it
was
merely
a
physical
satisfaction
but
i
believe
i
could
endure
the
idea
of
your
ever
having
lived
with
another
woman
for
a
protracted
period
or
even
having
wanted
to
marry
some
possible
girl
it
different
somehow
there
be
all
the
little
intimacies
remembered
and
they
dull
that
freshness
that
after
all
is
the
most
precious
part
of
love
rapturously
he
pulled
her
down
beside
him
on
the
pillow
oh
my
darling
he
whispered
as
if
i
remembered
anything
but
your
dear
kisses
then
gloria
in
a
very
mild
voice
anthony
did
i
hear
anybody
say
they
were
thirsty
anthony
laughed
abruptly
and
with
a
sheepish
and
amused
grin
got
out
of
bed
with
just
a
piece
of
ice
in
the
water
she
added
do
you
suppose
i
could
have
that
gloria
used
the
adjective
little
whenever
she
asked
a
favor
it
made
the
favor
sound
less
arduous
but
anthony
laughed
again
whether
she
wanted
a
cake
of
ice
or
a
marble
of
it
he
must
go
to
the
kitchen
her
voice
followed
him
through
the
hall
and
just
a
cracker
with
just
a
marmalade
on
it
oh
gosh
sighed
anthony
in
rapturous
slang
she
wonderful
that
girl
she
it
when
we
have
a
baby
she
began
one
day
this
it
had
already
been
decided
was
to
be
after
three
years
i
want
it
to
look
like
you
except
its
legs
he
insinuated
slyly
oh
yes
except
his
legs
he
got
to
have
my
legs
but
the
rest
of
him
can
be
you
my
nose
gloria
hesitated
well
perhaps
my
nose
but
certainly
your
eyes
and
my
mouth
and
i
guess
my
shape
of
the
face
i
wonder
i
think
he
be
sort
of
cute
if
he
had
my
hair
my
dear
gloria
you
appropriated
the
whole
baby
well
i
did
mean
to
she
apologized
cheerfully
let
him
have
my
neck
at
least
he
urged
regarding
himself
gravely
in
the
glass
you
often
said
you
liked
my
neck
because
the
adam
apple
does
show
and
besides
your
neck
too
short
why
it
is
she
cried
indignantly
turning
to
the
mirror
just
right
i
do
believe
i
ever
seen
a
better
neck
it
too
short
he
repeated
teasingly
short
her
tone
expressed
exasperated
wonder
short
you
crazy
she
elongated
and
contracted
it
to
convince
herself
of
its
reptilian
sinuousness
do
you
call
a
short
neck
one
of
the
shortest
i
ever
seen
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
tears
started
from
gloria
eyes
and
the
look
she
gave
him
had
a
quality
of
real
pain
oh
anthony
my
lord
gloria
he
approached
her
in
bewilderment
and
took
her
elbows
in
his
hands
do
cry
did
you
know
i
was
only
kidding
gloria
look
at
me
why
dearest
you
got
the
longest
neck
i
ever
seen
honestly
her
tears
dissolved
in
a
twisted
smile
well
you
should
have
said
that
then
let
talk
about
the
anthony
paced
the
floor
and
spoke
as
though
rehearsing
for
a
debate
to
put
it
briefly
there
are
two
babies
we
could
have
two
distinct
and
logical
babies
utterly
differentiated
there
the
baby
that
the
combination
of
the
best
of
both
of
us
your
body
my
eyes
my
mind
your
intelligence
and
then
there
is
the
baby
which
is
our
worst
my
body
your
disposition
and
my
irresolution
i
like
that
second
baby
she
said
what
i
really
like
continued
anthony
would
be
to
have
two
sets
of
triplets
one
year
apart
and
then
experiment
with
the
six
boys
poor
me
she
i
educate
them
each
in
a
different
country
and
by
a
different
system
and
when
they
were
i
call
them
together
and
see
what
they
were
like
let
have
all
with
my
neck
suggested
gloria
the
end
of
a
chapter
the
car
was
at
length
repaired
and
with
a
deliberate
vengeance
took
up
where
it
left
off
the
business
of
causing
infinite
dissension
who
should
drive
how
fast
should
gloria
go
these
two
questions
and
the
eternal
recriminations
involved
ran
through
the
days
they
motored
to
the
towns
rye
portchester
and
greenwich
and
called
on
a
dozen
friends
mostly
gloria
who
all
seemed
to
be
in
different
stages
of
having
babies
and
in
this
respect
as
well
as
in
others
bored
her
to
a
point
of
nervous
distraction
for
an
hour
after
each
visit
she
would
bite
her
fingers
furiously
and
be
inclined
to
take
out
her
rancor
on
anthony
i
loathe
women
she
cried
in
a
mild
temper
what
on
earth
can
you
say
to
them
except
talk
i
enthused
over
a
dozen
babies
that
i
wanted
only
to
choke
and
every
one
of
those
girls
is
either
incipiently
jealous
and
suspicious
of
her
husband
if
he
charming
or
beginning
to
be
bored
with
him
if
he
is
do
you
ever
intend
to
see
any
women
i
do
know
they
never
seem
clean
to
me
never
never
except
just
a
few
constance
shaw
you
know
the
merriam
who
came
over
to
see
us
last
tuesday
is
almost
the
only
one
she
so
tall
and
and
stately
i
do
like
them
so
tall
though
they
went
to
several
dinner
dances
at
various
country
clubs
they
decided
that
the
autumn
was
too
nearly
over
for
them
to
go
out
on
any
scale
even
had
they
been
so
inclined
he
hated
golf
gloria
liked
it
only
mildly
and
though
she
enjoyed
a
violent
rush
that
some
undergraduates
gave
her
one
night
and
was
glad
that
anthony
should
be
proud
of
her
beauty
she
also
perceived
that
their
hostess
for
the
evening
a
granby
was
somewhat
disquieted
by
the
fact
that
anthony
classmate
alec
granby
joined
with
enthusiasm
in
the
rush
the
granbys
never
phoned
again
and
though
gloria
laughed
it
piqued
her
not
a
little
you
see
she
explained
to
anthony
if
i
was
married
it
worry
her
but
she
been
to
the
movies
in
her
day
and
she
thinks
i
may
be
a
vampire
but
the
point
is
that
placating
such
people
requires
an
effort
that
i
simply
unwilling
to
make
and
those
cute
little
freshmen
making
eyes
at
me
and
paying
me
idiotic
compliments
i
grown
up
anthony
marietta
itself
offered
little
social
life
half
a
dozen
formed
a
hectagon
around
it
but
these
belonged
to
ancient
men
who
displayed
themselves
only
as
inert
lumps
in
the
back
of
limousines
on
their
way
to
the
station
whither
they
were
sometimes
accompanied
by
equally
ancient
and
doubly
massive
wives
the
townspeople
were
a
particularly
uninteresting
type
unmarried
females
were
predominant
for
the
most
part
with
horizons
and
souls
bleak
as
the
forbidding
white
architecture
of
the
three
churches
the
only
native
with
whom
they
came
into
close
contact
was
the
swedish
girl
who
came
every
day
to
do
their
work
she
was
silent
and
efficient
and
gloria
after
finding
her
weeping
violently
into
her
bowed
arms
upon
the
kitchen
table
developed
an
uncanny
fear
of
her
and
stopped
complaining
about
the
food
because
of
her
untold
and
esoteric
grief
the
girl
stayed
on
gloria
penchant
for
premonitions
and
her
bursts
of
vague
supernaturalism
were
a
surprise
to
anthony
either
some
complex
properly
and
scientifically
inhibited
in
the
early
years
with
her
bilphistic
mother
or
some
inherited
hypersensitiveness
made
her
susceptible
to
any
suggestion
of
the
psychic
and
far
from
gullible
about
the
motives
of
people
she
was
inclined
to
credit
any
extraordinary
happening
attributed
to
the
whimsical
perambulations
of
the
buried
the
desperate
squeakings
about
the
old
house
on
windy
nights
that
to
anthony
were
burglars
with
revolvers
ready
in
hand
represented
to
gloria
the
auras
evil
and
restive
of
dead
generations
expiating
the
inexpiable
upon
the
ancient
and
romantic
hearth
one
night
because
of
two
swift
bangs
which
anthony
fearfully
but
unavailingly
investigated
they
lay
awake
nearly
until
dawn
asking
each
other
questions
about
the
history
of
the
world
in
october
muriel
came
out
for
a
two
weeks
visit
gloria
had
called
her
on
and
miss
kane
ended
the
conversation
characteristically
by
saying
righty
i
be
there
with
bells
she
arrived
with
a
dozen
popular
songs
under
her
arm
you
ought
to
have
a
phonograph
out
here
in
the
country
she
said
just
a
little
vic
they
do
cost
much
then
whenever
you
lonesome
you
can
have
caruso
or
al
jolson
right
at
your
door
she
worried
anthony
to
distraction
by
telling
him
that
he
was
the
first
clever
man
she
had
ever
known
and
she
got
so
tired
of
shallow
people
he
wondered
that
people
fell
in
love
with
such
women
yet
he
supposed
that
under
a
certain
impassioned
glance
even
she
might
take
on
a
softness
and
promise
but
gloria
violently
showing
off
her
love
for
anthony
was
diverted
into
a
state
of
purring
content
finally
richard
caramel
arrived
for
a
garrulous
and
to
gloria
painfully
literary
during
which
he
discussed
himself
with
anthony
long
after
she
lay
in
childlike
sleep
it
been
mighty
funny
this
success
and
all
said
dick
just
before
the
novel
appeared
i
been
trying
without
success
to
sell
some
short
stories
then
after
my
book
came
out
i
polished
up
three
and
had
them
accepted
by
one
of
the
magazines
that
had
rejected
them
before
done
a
lot
of
them
since
publishers
do
pay
me
for
my
book
till
this
winter
do
let
the
victor
belong
to
the
spoils
you
mean
write
trash
he
considered
if
you
mean
deliberately
injecting
a
slushy
into
each
one
i
not
but
i
do
suppose
i
being
so
careful
i
certainly
writing
faster
and
i
do
seem
to
be
thinking
as
much
as
i
used
to
perhaps
it
because
i
do
get
any
conversation
now
that
you
married
and
maury
gone
to
philadelphia
have
the
old
urge
and
ambition
early
success
and
all
that
does
it
worry
you
frantically
i
get
a
thing
i
call
that
must
be
like
it
a
sort
of
intense
literary
that
comes
when
i
try
to
force
myself
but
the
really
awful
days
are
when
i
think
i
ca
write
they
when
i
wonder
whether
any
writing
is
worth
while
at
all
i
mean
whether
i
not
a
sort
of
glorified
buffoon
i
like
to
hear
you
talk
that
way
said
anthony
with
a
touch
of
his
old
patronizing
insolence
i
was
afraid
you
gotten
a
bit
idiotic
over
your
work
read
the
damnedest
interview
you
gave
out
dick
interrupted
with
an
agonized
expression
good
lord
do
mention
it
young
lady
wrote
it
most
admiring
young
lady
kept
telling
me
my
work
was
and
i
sort
of
lost
my
head
and
made
a
lot
of
strange
pronouncements
some
of
it
was
good
though
do
you
think
oh
yes
that
part
about
the
wise
writer
writing
for
the
youth
of
his
generation
the
critic
of
the
next
and
the
schoolmaster
of
ever
afterward
oh
i
believe
a
lot
of
it
admitted
richard
caramel
with
a
faint
beam
it
simply
was
a
mistake
to
give
it
out
in
november
they
moved
into
anthony
apartment
from
which
they
sallied
triumphantly
to
the
and
football
games
to
the
nicholas
rink
to
a
thorough
round
of
the
theatres
and
to
a
miscellany
of
entertainments
from
small
staid
dances
to
the
great
affairs
that
gloria
loved
held
in
those
few
houses
where
lackeys
with
powdered
wigs
scurried
around
in
magnificent
anglomania
under
the
direction
of
gigantic
majordomos
their
intention
was
to
go
abroad
the
first
of
the
year
or
at
any
rate
when
the
war
was
over
anthony
had
actually
completed
a
chestertonian
essay
on
the
twelfth
century
by
way
of
introduction
to
his
proposed
book
and
gloria
had
done
some
extensive
research
work
on
the
question
of
russian
sable
coats
in
fact
the
winter
was
approaching
quite
comfortably
when
the
bilphistic
demiurge
decided
suddenly
in
that
gilbert
soul
had
aged
sufficiently
in
its
present
incarnation
in
consequence
anthony
took
a
miserable
and
hysterical
gloria
out
to
kansas
city
where
in
the
fashion
of
mankind
they
paid
the
terrible
and
deference
to
the
dead
gilbert
became
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
his
life
a
truly
pathetic
figure
that
woman
he
had
broken
to
wait
upon
his
body
and
play
congregation
to
his
mind
had
ironically
deserted
him
just
when
he
could
not
much
longer
have
supported
her
never
again
would
he
be
able
so
satisfactorily
to
bore
and
bully
a
human
soul
chapter
ii
symposium
gloria
had
lulled
anthony
mind
to
sleep
she
who
seemed
of
all
women
the
wisest
and
the
finest
hung
like
a
brilliant
curtain
across
his
doorways
shutting
out
the
light
of
the
sun
in
those
first
years
what
he
believed
bore
invariably
the
stamp
of
gloria
he
saw
the
sun
always
through
the
pattern
of
the
curtain
it
was
a
sort
of
lassitude
that
brought
them
back
to
marietta
for
another
summer
through
a
golden
enervating
spring
they
had
loitered
restive
and
lazily
extravagant
along
the
california
coast
joining
other
parties
intermittently
and
drifting
from
pasadena
to
coronado
from
coronado
to
santa
barbara
with
no
purpose
more
apparent
than
gloria
desire
to
dance
by
different
music
or
catch
some
infinitesimal
variant
among
the
changing
colors
of
the
sea
out
of
the
pacific
there
rose
to
greet
them
savage
rocklands
and
equally
barbaric
hostelries
built
that
at
one
might
drowse
into
a
languid
wicker
bazaar
glorified
by
the
polo
costumes
of
southhampton
and
lake
forest
and
newport
and
palm
beach
and
as
the
waves
met
and
splashed
and
glittered
in
the
most
placid
of
the
bays
so
they
joined
this
group
and
that
and
with
them
shifted
stations
murmuring
ever
of
those
strange
unsubstantial
gaieties
in
wait
just
over
the
next
green
and
fruitful
valley
a
simple
healthy
leisure
class
it
was
the
best
of
the
men
not
unpleasantly
undergraduate
they
seemed
to
be
on
a
perpetual
candidates
list
for
some
etherealized
porcellian
or
skull
and
bones
extended
out
indefinitely
into
the
world
the
women
of
more
than
average
beauty
fragilely
athletic
somewhat
idiotic
as
hostesses
but
charming
and
infinitely
decorative
as
guests
sedately
and
gracefully
they
danced
the
steps
of
their
selection
in
the
balmy
tea
hours
accomplishing
with
a
certain
dignity
the
movements
so
horribly
burlesqued
by
clerk
and
chorus
girl
the
country
over
it
seemed
ironic
that
in
this
lone
and
discredited
offspring
of
the
arts
americans
should
excel
unquestionably
having
danced
and
splashed
through
a
lavish
spring
anthony
and
gloria
found
that
they
had
spent
too
much
money
and
for
this
must
go
into
retirement
for
a
certain
period
there
was
anthony
work
they
said
almost
before
they
knew
it
they
were
back
in
the
gray
house
more
aware
now
that
other
lovers
had
slept
there
other
names
had
been
called
over
the
banisters
other
couples
had
sat
upon
the
porch
steps
watching
the
fields
and
the
black
bulk
of
woods
beyond
it
was
the
same
anthony
more
restless
inclined
to
quicken
only
under
the
stimulus
of
several
faintly
almost
imperceptibly
apathetic
toward
gloria
but
gloria
she
would
be
in
august
and
was
in
an
attractive
but
sincere
panic
about
it
six
years
to
thirty
had
she
been
less
in
love
with
anthony
her
sense
of
the
flight
of
time
would
have
expressed
itself
in
a
reawakened
interest
in
other
men
in
a
deliberate
intention
of
extracting
a
transient
gleam
of
romance
from
every
potential
lover
who
glanced
at
her
with
lowered
brows
over
a
shining
dinner
table
she
said
to
anthony
one
day
how
i
feel
is
that
if
i
wanted
anything
i
take
it
that
what
always
thought
all
my
life
but
it
happens
that
i
want
you
and
so
i
just
have
room
for
any
other
desires
they
were
bound
eastward
through
a
parched
and
lifeless
indiana
and
she
had
looked
up
from
one
of
her
beloved
moving
picture
magazines
to
find
a
casual
conversation
suddenly
turned
grave
anthony
frowned
out
the
car
window
as
the
track
crossed
a
country
road
a
farmer
appeared
momentarily
in
his
wagon
he
was
chewing
on
a
straw
and
was
apparently
the
same
farmer
they
had
passed
a
dozen
times
before
sitting
in
silent
and
malignant
symbolism
as
anthony
turned
to
gloria
his
frown
intensified
you
worry
me
he
objected
i
can
imagine
another
woman
under
certain
transitory
circumstances
but
i
ca
imagine
taking
her
but
i
do
feel
that
way
anthony
i
ca
be
bothered
resisting
things
i
want
my
way
is
not
to
want
them
to
want
nobody
but
you
yet
when
i
think
that
if
you
just
happened
to
take
a
fancy
to
some
one
oh
do
be
an
idiot
she
exclaimed
there
be
nothing
casual
about
it
and
i
ca
even
imagine
the
possibility
this
emphatically
closed
the
conversation
anthony
unfailing
appreciation
made
her
happier
in
his
company
than
in
any
one
else
she
definitely
enjoyed
him
she
loved
him
so
the
summer
began
very
much
as
had
the
one
before
there
was
however
one
radical
change
in
ménage
the
scandinavian
whose
austere
cooking
and
sardonic
manner
of
waiting
on
table
had
so
depressed
gloria
gave
way
to
an
exceedingly
efficient
japanese
whose
name
was
tanalahaka
but
who
confessed
that
he
heeded
any
summons
which
included
the
dissyllable
tana
tana
was
unusually
small
even
for
a
japanese
and
displayed
a
somewhat
naïve
conception
of
himself
as
a
man
of
the
world
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
from
gugimoniki
japanese
reliable
employment
agency
he
called
anthony
into
his
room
to
see
the
treasures
of
his
trunk
these
included
a
large
collection
of
japanese
post
cards
which
he
was
all
for
explaining
to
his
employer
at
once
individually
and
at
great
length
among
them
were
half
a
dozen
of
pornographic
intent
and
plainly
of
american
origin
though
the
makers
had
modestly
omitted
both
their
names
and
the
form
for
mailing
he
next
brought
out
some
of
his
own
handiwork
a
pair
of
american
pants
which
he
had
made
himself
and
two
suits
of
solid
silk
underwear
he
informed
anthony
confidentially
as
to
the
purpose
for
which
these
latter
were
reserved
the
next
exhibit
was
a
rather
good
copy
of
an
etching
of
abraham
lincoln
to
whose
face
he
had
given
an
unmistakable
japanese
cast
last
came
a
flute
he
had
made
it
himself
but
it
was
broken
he
was
going
to
fix
it
soon
after
these
polite
formalities
which
anthony
conjectured
must
be
native
to
japan
tana
delivered
a
long
harangue
in
splintered
english
on
the
relation
of
master
and
servant
from
which
anthony
gathered
that
he
had
worked
on
large
estates
but
had
always
quarrelled
with
the
other
servants
because
they
were
not
honest
they
had
a
great
time
over
the
word
honest
and
in
fact
became
rather
irritated
with
each
other
because
anthony
persisted
stubbornly
that
tana
was
trying
to
say
hornets
and
even
went
to
the
extent
of
buzzing
in
the
manner
of
a
bee
and
flapping
his
arms
to
imitate
wings
after
of
an
hour
anthony
was
released
with
the
warm
assurance
that
they
would
have
other
nice
chats
in
which
tana
would
tell
how
we
do
in
my
countree
such
was
tana
garrulous
première
in
the
gray
house
and
he
fulfilled
its
promise
though
he
was
conscientious
and
honorable
he
was
unquestionably
a
terrific
bore
he
seemed
unable
to
control
his
tongue
sometimes
continuing
from
paragraph
to
paragraph
with
a
look
akin
to
pain
in
his
small
brown
eyes
sunday
and
monday
afternoons
he
read
the
comic
sections
of
the
newspapers
one
cartoon
which
contained
a
facetious
japanese
butler
diverted
him
enormously
though
he
claimed
that
the
protagonist
who
to
anthony
appeared
clearly
oriental
had
really
an
american
face
the
difficulty
with
the
funny
paper
was
that
when
aided
by
anthony
he
had
spelled
out
the
last
three
pictures
and
assimilated
their
context
with
a
concentration
surely
adequate
for
kant
critique
he
had
entirely
forgotten
what
the
first
pictures
were
about
in
the
middle
of
june
anthony
and
gloria
celebrated
their
first
anniversary
by
having
a
date
anthony
knocked
at
the
door
and
she
ran
to
let
him
in
then
they
sat
together
on
the
couch
calling
over
those
names
they
had
made
for
each
other
new
combinations
of
endearments
ages
old
yet
to
this
date
was
appended
no
attenuated
with
its
ecstasy
of
regret
later
in
june
horror
leered
out
at
gloria
struck
at
her
and
frightened
her
bright
soul
back
half
a
generation
then
slowly
it
faded
out
faded
back
into
that
impenetrable
darkness
whence
it
had
come
taking
relentlessly
its
modicum
of
youth
with
an
infallible
sense
of
the
dramatic
it
chose
a
little
railroad
station
in
a
wretched
village
near
portchester
the
station
platform
lay
all
day
bare
as
a
prairie
exposed
to
the
dusty
yellow
sun
and
to
the
glance
of
that
most
obnoxious
type
of
countryman
who
lives
near
a
metropolis
and
has
attained
its
cheap
smartness
without
its
urbanity
a
dozen
of
these
yokels
cheerless
as
scarecrows
saw
the
incident
dimly
it
passed
across
their
confused
and
uncomprehending
minds
taken
at
its
broadest
for
a
coarse
joke
at
its
subtlest
for
a
shame
meanwhile
there
upon
the
platform
a
measure
of
brightness
faded
from
the
world
with
eric
merriam
anthony
had
been
sitting
over
a
decanter
of
scotch
all
the
hot
summer
afternoon
while
gloria
and
constance
merriam
swam
and
sunned
themselves
at
the
beach
club
the
latter
under
a
striped
gloria
stretched
sensuously
upon
the
soft
hot
sand
tanning
her
inevitable
legs
later
they
had
all
four
played
with
inconsequential
sandwiches
then
gloria
had
risen
tapping
knee
with
her
parasol
to
get
his
attention
we
got
to
go
dear
now
he
looked
at
her
unwillingly
at
that
moment
nothing
seemed
of
more
importance
than
to
idle
on
that
shady
porch
drinking
mellowed
scotch
while
his
host
reminisced
interminably
on
the
byplay
of
some
forgotten
political
campaign
we
really
got
to
go
repeated
gloria
we
can
get
a
taxi
to
the
station
come
on
anthony
she
commanded
a
bit
more
imperiously
now
see
here
merriam
his
yarn
cut
off
made
conventional
objections
meanwhile
provocatively
filling
his
guest
glass
with
a
that
should
have
been
sipped
through
ten
minutes
but
at
gloria
annoyed
we
really
anthony
drank
it
off
got
to
his
feet
and
made
an
elaborate
bow
to
his
hostess
it
seems
we
he
said
with
little
grace
in
a
minute
he
was
following
gloria
down
a
between
tall
her
parasol
brushing
gently
the
leaves
most
inconsiderate
he
thought
as
they
reached
the
road
he
felt
with
injured
naïvete
that
gloria
should
not
have
interrupted
such
innocent
and
harmless
enjoyment
the
whiskey
had
both
soothed
and
clarified
the
restless
things
in
his
mind
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
had
taken
this
same
attitude
several
times
before
was
he
always
to
retreat
from
pleasant
episodes
at
a
touch
of
her
parasol
or
a
flicker
of
her
eye
his
unwillingness
blurred
to
ill
will
which
rose
within
him
like
a
resistless
bubble
he
kept
silent
perversely
inhibiting
a
desire
to
reproach
her
they
found
a
taxi
in
front
of
the
inn
rode
silently
to
the
little
station
then
anthony
knew
what
he
wanted
to
assert
his
will
against
this
cool
and
impervious
girl
to
obtain
with
one
magnificent
effort
a
mastery
that
seemed
infinitely
desirable
let
go
over
to
see
the
barneses
he
said
without
looking
at
her
i
do
feel
like
going
home
barnes
née
rachael
jerryl
had
a
summer
place
several
miles
from
redgate
we
went
there
day
before
yesterday
she
answered
shortly
i
sure
they
be
glad
to
see
us
he
felt
that
that
was
not
a
strong
enough
note
braced
himself
stubbornly
and
added
i
want
to
see
the
barneses
i
have
any
desire
to
go
home
well
i
have
any
desire
to
go
to
the
barneses
suddenly
they
stared
at
each
other
why
anthony
she
said
with
annoyance
this
is
sunday
night
and
they
probably
have
guests
for
supper
why
we
should
go
in
at
this
hour
then
why
could
we
have
stayed
at
the
merriams
he
burst
out
why
go
home
when
we
were
having
a
perfectly
decent
time
they
asked
us
to
supper
they
had
to
give
me
the
money
and
i
get
the
railroad
tickets
i
certainly
will
not
i
in
no
humour
for
a
ride
in
that
damn
hot
train
gloria
stamped
her
foot
on
the
platform
anthony
you
act
as
if
you
tight
on
the
contrary
i
perfectly
sober
but
his
voice
had
slipped
into
a
husky
key
and
she
knew
with
certainty
that
this
was
untrue
if
you
sober
you
give
me
the
money
for
the
tickets
but
it
was
too
late
to
talk
to
him
that
way
in
his
mind
was
but
one
idea
that
gloria
was
being
selfish
that
she
was
always
being
selfish
and
would
continue
to
be
unless
here
and
now
he
asserted
himself
as
her
master
this
was
the
occasion
of
all
occasions
since
for
a
whim
she
had
deprived
him
of
a
pleasure
his
determination
solidified
approached
momentarily
a
dull
and
sullen
hate
i
wo
go
in
the
train
he
said
his
voice
trembling
a
little
with
anger
we
going
to
the
barneses
i
not
she
cried
if
you
go
i
going
home
alone
go
on
then
without
a
word
she
turned
toward
the
ticket
office
simultaneously
he
remembered
that
she
had
some
money
with
her
and
that
this
was
not
the
sort
of
victory
he
wanted
the
sort
he
must
have
he
took
a
step
after
her
and
seized
her
arm
see
here
he
muttered
you
going
alone
i
certainly
am
why
anthony
this
exclamation
as
she
tried
to
pull
away
from
him
and
he
only
tightened
his
grasp
he
looked
at
her
with
narrowed
and
malicious
eyes
let
go
her
cry
had
a
quality
of
fierceness
if
you
have
decency
you
let
go
why
he
knew
why
but
he
took
a
confused
and
not
quite
confident
pride
in
holding
her
there
i
going
home
do
you
understand
and
you
going
to
let
me
go
no
i
not
her
eyes
were
burning
now
are
you
going
to
make
a
scene
here
i
say
you
not
going
i
tired
of
your
eternal
selfishness
i
only
want
to
go
home
two
wrathful
tears
started
from
her
eyes
this
time
you
going
to
do
what
say
slowly
her
body
straightened
her
head
went
back
in
a
gesture
of
infinite
scorn
i
hate
you
her
low
words
were
expelled
like
venom
through
her
clenched
teeth
oh
me
go
oh
i
you
she
tried
to
jerk
herself
away
but
he
only
grasped
the
other
arm
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
at
gloria
fury
his
uncertainty
returned
but
he
felt
that
now
he
had
gone
too
far
to
give
in
it
seemed
that
he
had
always
given
in
and
that
in
her
heart
she
had
despised
him
for
it
ah
she
might
hate
him
now
but
afterward
she
would
admire
him
for
his
dominance
the
approaching
train
gave
out
a
premonitory
siren
that
tumbled
melodramatically
toward
them
down
the
glistening
blue
tracks
gloria
tugged
and
strained
to
free
herself
and
words
older
than
the
book
of
genesis
came
to
her
lips
oh
you
brute
she
sobbed
oh
you
brute
oh
i
hate
you
oh
you
brute
oh
on
the
station
platform
other
prospective
passengers
were
beginning
to
turn
and
stare
the
drone
of
the
train
was
audible
it
increased
to
a
clamor
gloria
efforts
redoubled
then
ceased
altogether
and
she
stood
there
trembling
and
at
this
helpless
humiliation
as
the
engine
roared
and
thundered
into
the
station
low
below
the
flood
of
steam
and
the
grinding
of
the
brakes
came
her
voice
oh
if
there
was
one
here
you
could
do
this
you
could
do
this
you
coward
you
coward
oh
you
coward
anthony
silent
trembling
himself
gripped
her
rigidly
aware
that
faces
dozens
of
them
curiously
unmoved
shadows
of
a
dream
were
regarding
him
then
the
bells
distilled
metallic
crashes
that
were
like
physical
pain
the
volleyed
in
slow
acceleration
at
the
sky
and
in
a
moment
of
noise
and
gray
gaseous
turbulence
the
line
of
faces
ran
by
moved
off
became
indistinct
until
suddenly
there
was
only
the
sun
slanting
east
across
the
tracks
and
a
volume
of
sound
decreasing
far
off
like
a
train
made
out
of
tin
thunder
he
dropped
her
arms
he
had
won
now
if
he
wished
he
might
laugh
the
test
was
done
and
he
had
sustained
his
will
with
violence
let
leniency
walk
in
the
wake
of
victory
we
hire
a
car
here
and
drive
back
to
marietta
he
said
with
fine
reserve
for
answer
gloria
seized
his
hand
with
both
of
hers
and
raising
it
to
her
mouth
bit
deeply
into
his
thumb
he
scarcely
noticed
the
pain
seeing
the
blood
spurt
he
drew
out
his
handkerchief
and
wrapped
the
wound
that
too
was
part
of
the
triumph
he
supposed
it
was
inevitable
that
defeat
should
thus
be
resented
and
as
such
was
beneath
notice
she
was
sobbing
almost
without
tears
profoundly
and
bitterly
i
wo
go
i
wo
go
you
ca
make
me
go
you
you
killed
any
love
i
ever
had
for
you
and
any
respect
but
all
that
left
in
me
would
die
before
i
move
from
this
place
oh
if
i
thought
lay
your
hands
on
me
you
going
with
me
he
said
brutally
if
i
have
to
carry
you
he
turned
beckoned
to
a
taxicab
told
the
driver
to
go
to
marietta
the
man
dismounted
and
swung
the
door
open
anthony
faced
his
wife
and
said
between
his
clenched
teeth
will
you
get
in
or
will
i
you
in
with
a
subdued
cry
of
infinite
pain
and
despair
she
yielded
herself
up
and
got
into
the
car
all
the
long
ride
through
the
increasing
dark
of
twilight
she
sat
huddled
in
her
side
of
the
car
her
silence
broken
by
an
occasional
dry
and
solitary
sob
anthony
stared
out
the
window
his
mind
working
dully
on
the
slowly
changing
significance
of
what
had
occurred
something
was
wrong
that
last
cry
of
gloria
had
struck
a
chord
which
echoed
posthumously
and
with
incongruous
disquiet
in
his
heart
he
must
be
right
yet
she
seemed
such
a
pathetic
little
thing
now
broken
and
dispirited
humiliated
beyond
the
measure
of
her
lot
to
bear
the
sleeves
of
her
dress
were
torn
her
parasol
was
gone
forgotten
on
the
platform
it
was
a
new
costume
he
remembered
and
she
had
been
so
proud
of
it
that
very
morning
when
they
had
left
the
house
he
began
wondering
if
any
one
they
knew
had
seen
the
incident
and
persistently
there
recurred
to
him
her
cry
all
that
left
in
me
would
die
this
gave
him
a
confused
and
increasing
worry
it
fitted
so
well
with
the
gloria
who
lay
in
the
corner
no
longer
a
proud
gloria
nor
any
gloria
he
had
known
he
asked
himself
if
it
were
possible
while
he
did
not
believe
she
would
cease
to
love
him
this
of
course
was
unthinkable
it
was
yet
problematical
whether
gloria
without
her
arrogance
her
independence
her
virginal
confidence
and
courage
would
be
the
girl
of
his
glory
the
radiant
woman
who
was
precious
and
charming
because
she
was
ineffably
triumphantly
herself
he
was
very
drunk
even
then
so
drunk
as
not
to
realize
his
own
drunkenness
when
they
reached
the
gray
house
he
went
to
his
own
room
and
his
mind
still
wrestling
helplessly
and
sombrely
with
what
he
had
done
fell
into
a
deep
stupor
on
his
bed
it
was
after
one
and
the
hall
seemed
extraordinarily
quiet
when
gloria
and
sleepless
traversed
it
and
pushed
open
the
door
of
his
room
he
had
been
too
befuddled
to
open
the
windows
and
the
air
was
stale
and
thick
with
whiskey
she
stood
for
a
moment
by
his
bed
a
slender
exquisitely
graceful
figure
in
her
boyish
silk
pajamas
then
with
abandon
she
flung
herself
upon
him
half
waking
him
in
the
frantic
emotion
of
her
embrace
dropping
her
warm
tears
upon
his
throat
oh
anthony
she
cried
passionately
oh
my
darling
you
do
know
what
you
did
yet
in
the
morning
coming
early
into
her
room
he
knelt
down
by
her
bed
and
cried
like
a
little
boy
as
though
it
was
his
heart
that
had
been
broken
it
seemed
last
night
she
said
gravely
her
fingers
playing
in
his
hair
that
all
the
part
of
me
you
loved
the
part
that
was
worth
knowing
all
the
pride
and
fire
was
gone
i
knew
that
what
was
left
of
me
would
always
love
you
but
never
in
quite
the
same
way
nevertheless
she
was
aware
even
then
that
she
would
forget
in
time
and
that
it
is
the
manner
of
life
seldom
to
strike
but
always
to
wear
away
after
that
morning
the
incident
was
never
mentioned
and
its
deep
wound
healed
with
anthony
hand
and
if
there
was
triumph
some
darker
force
than
theirs
possessed
it
possessed
the
knowledge
and
the
victory
nietzschean
incident
gloria
independence
like
all
sincere
and
profound
qualities
had
begun
unconsciously
but
once
brought
to
her
attention
by
fascinated
discovery
of
it
it
assumed
more
nearly
the
proportions
of
a
formal
code
from
her
conversation
it
might
be
assumed
that
all
her
energy
and
vitality
went
into
a
violent
affirmation
of
the
negative
principle
never
give
a
damn
not
for
anything
or
anybody
she
said
except
myself
and
by
implication
for
anthony
that
the
rule
of
all
life
and
if
it
i
be
that
way
anyhow
nobody
do
anything
for
me
if
it
did
gratify
them
to
and
i
do
as
little
for
them
she
was
on
the
front
porch
of
the
nicest
lady
in
marietta
when
she
said
this
and
as
she
finished
she
gave
a
curious
little
cry
and
sank
in
a
dead
faint
to
the
porch
floor
the
lady
brought
her
to
and
drove
her
home
in
her
car
it
had
occurred
to
the
estimable
gloria
that
she
was
probably
with
child
she
lay
upon
the
long
lounge
day
was
slipping
warmly
out
the
window
touching
the
late
roses
on
the
porch
pillars
all
i
think
of
ever
is
that
i
love
you
she
wailed
i
value
my
body
because
you
think
it
beautiful
and
this
body
of
mine
of
yours
to
have
it
grow
ugly
and
shapeless
it
simply
intolerable
oh
anthony
i
not
afraid
of
the
pain
he
consoled
her
desperately
but
in
vain
she
continued
and
then
afterward
i
might
have
wide
hips
and
be
pale
with
all
my
freshness
gone
and
no
radiance
in
my
hair
he
paced
the
floor
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
asking
is
it
certain
i
do
know
anything
i
always
hated
obstrics
or
whatever
you
call
them
i
thought
i
have
a
child
some
time
but
not
now
well
for
god
sake
do
lie
there
and
go
to
pieces
her
sobs
lapsed
she
drew
down
a
merciful
silence
from
the
twilight
which
filled
the
room
turn
on
the
lights
she
pleaded
these
days
seem
so
short
june
seemed
to
have
longer
days
when
i
was
a
little
girl
the
lights
snapped
on
and
it
was
as
though
blue
drapes
of
softest
silk
had
been
dropped
behind
the
windows
and
the
door
her
pallor
her
immobility
without
grief
now
or
joy
awoke
his
sympathy
do
you
want
me
to
have
it
she
asked
listlessly
i
indifferent
that
is
i
neutral
if
you
have
it
i
probably
be
glad
if
you
do
well
that
all
right
too
i
wish
you
make
up
your
mind
one
way
or
the
other
suppose
you
make
up
mind
she
looked
at
him
contemptuously
scorning
to
answer
you
think
you
been
singled
out
of
all
the
women
in
the
world
for
this
crowning
indignity
what
if
i
do
she
cried
angrily
it
is
an
indignity
for
them
their
one
excuse
for
living
it
the
one
thing
they
good
for
it
an
indignity
for
see
here
gloria
i
with
you
whatever
you
do
but
for
god
sake
be
a
sport
about
it
oh
do
at
me
she
wailed
they
exchanged
a
mute
look
of
no
particular
significance
but
of
much
stress
then
anthony
took
a
book
from
the
shelf
and
dropped
into
a
chair
half
an
hour
later
her
voice
came
out
of
the
intense
stillness
that
pervaded
the
room
and
hung
like
incense
on
the
air
i
drive
over
and
see
constance
merriam
all
right
and
i
go
to
tarrytown
and
see
grampa
you
see
she
added
it
is
that
i
afraid
of
this
or
anything
else
i
being
true
to
me
you
know
i
know
he
agreed
the
practical
men
adam
patch
in
a
pious
rage
against
the
germans
subsisted
on
the
war
news
pin
maps
plastered
his
walls
atlases
were
piled
deep
on
tables
convenient
to
his
hand
together
with
photographic
histories
of
the
world
war
official
and
the
personal
impressions
of
war
correspondents
and
of
privates
x
y
and
z
several
times
during
anthony
visit
his
grandfather
secretary
edward
shuttleworth
the
accomplished
of
pat
place
in
hoboken
now
shod
with
righteous
indignation
would
appear
with
an
extra
the
old
man
attacked
each
paper
with
untiring
fury
tearing
out
those
columns
which
appeared
to
him
of
sufficient
pregnancy
for
preservation
and
thrusting
them
into
one
of
his
already
bulging
files
well
what
have
you
been
doing
he
asked
anthony
blandly
nothing
well
i
thought
so
i
been
intending
to
drive
over
and
see
you
all
summer
i
been
writing
do
you
remember
the
essay
i
sent
you
the
one
i
sold
to
the
florentine
last
winter
essay
you
never
sent
any
essay
oh
yes
i
did
we
talked
about
it
adam
patch
shook
his
head
mildly
oh
no
you
never
sent
any
essay
you
may
have
thought
you
sent
it
but
it
never
reached
me
why
you
read
it
grampa
insisted
anthony
somewhat
exasperated
you
read
it
and
disagreed
with
it
the
old
man
suddenly
remembered
but
this
was
made
apparent
only
by
a
partial
falling
open
of
his
mouth
displaying
rows
of
gray
gums
eying
anthony
with
a
green
and
ancient
stare
he
hesitated
between
confessing
his
error
and
covering
it
up
so
you
writing
he
said
quickly
well
why
do
you
go
over
and
write
about
these
germans
write
something
real
something
about
going
on
something
people
can
read
anybody
ca
be
a
war
correspondent
objected
anthony
you
have
to
have
some
newspaper
willing
to
buy
your
stuff
and
i
ca
spare
the
money
to
go
over
as
a
i
send
you
over
suggested
his
grandfather
surprisingly
i
get
you
over
as
an
authorized
correspondent
of
any
newspaper
you
pick
out
anthony
recoiled
from
the
idea
almost
simultaneously
he
bounded
toward
it
i
do
know
he
would
have
to
leave
gloria
whose
whole
life
yearned
toward
him
and
enfolded
him
gloria
was
in
trouble
oh
the
thing
feasible
yet
he
saw
himself
in
khaki
leaning
as
all
war
correspondents
lean
upon
a
heavy
stick
portfolio
at
shoulder
trying
to
look
like
an
englishman
i
like
to
think
it
over
he
confessed
it
certainly
very
kind
of
you
i
think
it
over
and
i
let
you
know
thinking
it
over
absorbed
him
on
the
journey
to
new
york
he
had
had
one
of
those
sudden
flashes
of
illumination
vouchsafed
to
all
men
who
are
dominated
by
a
strong
and
beloved
woman
which
show
them
a
world
of
harder
men
more
fiercely
trained
and
grappling
with
the
abstractions
of
thought
and
war
in
that
world
the
arms
of
gloria
would
exist
only
as
the
hot
embrace
of
a
chance
mistress
coolly
sought
and
quickly
forgotten
these
unfamiliar
phantoms
were
crowding
closely
about
him
when
he
boarded
his
train
for
marietta
in
the
grand
central
station
the
car
was
crowded
he
secured
the
last
vacant
seat
and
it
was
only
after
several
minutes
that
he
gave
even
a
casual
glance
to
the
man
beside
him
when
he
did
he
saw
a
heavy
lay
of
jaw
and
nose
a
curved
chin
and
small
eyes
in
a
moment
he
recognized
joseph
bloeckman
simultaneously
they
both
half
rose
were
half
embarrassed
and
exchanged
what
amounted
to
a
half
handshake
then
as
though
to
complete
the
matter
they
both
half
laughed
well
remarked
anthony
without
inspiration
i
have
seen
you
for
a
long
time
immediately
he
regretted
his
words
and
started
to
add
i
did
know
you
lived
out
this
way
but
bloeckman
anticipated
him
by
asking
pleasantly
how
your
wife
she
very
well
how
you
been
excellent
his
tone
amplified
the
grandeur
of
the
word
it
seemed
to
anthony
that
during
the
last
year
bloeckman
had
grown
tremendously
in
dignity
the
boiled
look
was
gone
he
seemed
done
at
last
in
addition
he
was
no
longer
overdressed
the
inappropriate
facetiousness
he
had
affected
in
ties
had
given
way
to
a
sturdy
dark
pattern
and
his
right
hand
which
had
formerly
displayed
two
heavy
rings
was
now
innocent
of
ornament
and
even
without
the
raw
glow
of
a
manicure
this
dignity
appeared
also
in
his
personality
the
last
aura
of
the
successful
had
faded
from
him
that
deliberate
ingratiation
of
which
the
lowest
form
is
the
bawdy
joke
in
the
pullman
smoker
one
imagined
that
having
been
fawned
upon
financially
he
had
attained
aloofness
having
been
snubbed
socially
he
had
acquired
reticence
but
whatever
had
given
him
weight
instead
of
bulk
anthony
no
longer
felt
a
correct
superiority
in
his
presence
remember
caramel
richard
caramel
i
believe
you
met
him
one
night
i
remember
he
was
writing
a
book
well
he
sold
it
to
the
movies
then
they
had
some
scenario
man
named
jordan
work
on
it
well
dick
subscribes
to
a
clipping
bureau
and
furious
because
about
half
the
movie
reviewers
speak
of
the
and
strength
of
william
jordan
demon
lover
did
mention
old
dick
at
all
you
think
this
fellow
jordan
had
actually
conceived
and
developed
the
thing
bloeckman
nodded
comprehensively
most
of
the
contracts
state
that
the
original
writer
name
goes
into
all
the
paid
publicity
is
caramel
still
writing
oh
yes
writing
hard
short
stories
well
that
fine
that
fine
you
on
this
train
often
about
once
a
week
we
live
in
marietta
is
that
so
well
well
i
live
near
cos
cob
myself
bought
a
place
there
only
recently
we
only
five
miles
apart
you
have
to
come
and
see
us
anthony
was
surprised
at
his
own
courtesy
i
sure
gloria
be
delighted
to
see
an
old
friend
anybody
tell
you
where
the
house
is
it
our
second
season
there
thank
you
then
as
though
returning
a
complementary
politeness
how
is
your
grandfather
he
been
well
i
had
lunch
with
him
a
great
character
said
bloeckman
severely
a
fine
example
of
an
american
the
triumph
of
lethargy
anthony
found
his
wife
deep
in
the
porch
hammock
voluptuously
engaged
with
a
lemonade
and
a
tomato
sandwich
and
carrying
on
an
apparently
cheery
conversation
with
tana
upon
one
of
tana
complicated
themes
in
my
countree
anthony
recognized
his
invariable
preface
all
time
peoples
eat
rice
because
have
got
can
not
eat
what
no
have
got
had
his
nationality
not
been
desperately
apparent
one
would
have
thought
he
had
acquired
his
knowledge
of
his
native
land
from
american
geographies
when
the
oriental
had
been
squelched
and
dismissed
to
the
kitchen
anthony
turned
questioningly
to
gloria
it
all
right
she
announced
smiling
broadly
and
it
surprised
me
more
than
it
does
you
there
no
doubt
none
could
be
they
rejoiced
happily
gay
again
with
reborn
irresponsibility
then
he
told
her
of
his
opportunity
to
go
abroad
and
that
he
was
almost
ashamed
to
reject
it
what
do
think
just
tell
me
frankly
why
anthony
her
eyes
were
startled
do
you
want
to
go
without
me
his
face
fell
yet
he
knew
with
his
wife
question
that
it
was
too
late
her
arms
sweet
and
strangling
were
around
him
for
he
had
made
all
such
choices
back
in
that
room
in
the
plaza
the
year
before
this
was
an
anachronism
from
an
age
of
such
dreams
gloria
he
lied
in
a
great
burst
of
comprehension
of
course
i
do
i
was
thinking
you
might
go
as
a
nurse
or
something
he
wondered
dully
if
his
grandfather
would
consider
this
as
she
smiled
he
realized
again
how
beautiful
she
was
a
gorgeous
girl
of
miraculous
freshness
and
sheerly
honorable
eyes
she
embraced
his
suggestion
with
luxurious
intensity
holding
it
aloft
like
a
sun
of
her
own
making
and
basking
in
its
beams
she
strung
together
an
amazing
synopsis
for
an
extravaganza
of
martial
adventure
after
supper
surfeited
with
the
subject
she
yawned
she
wanted
not
to
talk
but
only
to
read
penrod
stretched
upon
the
lounge
until
at
midnight
she
fell
asleep
but
anthony
after
he
had
carried
her
romantically
up
the
stairs
stayed
awake
to
brood
upon
the
day
vaguely
angry
with
her
vaguely
dissatisfied
what
am
i
going
to
do
he
began
at
breakfast
here
we
been
married
a
year
and
we
just
worried
around
without
even
being
efficient
people
of
leisure
yes
you
ought
to
do
something
she
admitted
being
in
an
agreeable
and
loquacious
humor
this
was
not
the
first
of
these
discussions
but
as
they
usually
developed
anthony
in
the
rôle
of
protagonist
she
had
come
to
avoid
them
it
not
that
i
have
any
moral
compunctions
about
work
he
continued
but
grampa
may
die
and
he
may
live
for
ten
years
meanwhile
we
living
above
our
income
and
all
we
got
to
show
for
it
is
a
farmer
car
and
a
few
clothes
we
keep
an
apartment
that
we
only
lived
in
three
months
and
a
little
old
house
way
off
in
nowhere
frequently
bored
and
yet
we
wo
make
any
effort
to
know
any
one
except
the
same
crowd
who
drift
around
california
all
summer
wearing
sport
clothes
and
waiting
for
their
families
to
die
how
you
changed
remarked
gloria
once
you
told
me
you
did
see
why
an
american
could
loaf
gracefully
well
damn
it
i
was
married
and
the
old
mind
was
working
at
top
speed
and
now
it
going
round
and
round
like
a
with
nothing
to
catch
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
that
if
i
had
met
you
i
have
done
something
but
you
make
leisure
so
subtly
attractive
oh
it
all
my
fault
i
did
mean
that
and
you
know
i
did
but
here
i
almost
and
oh
she
interrupted
in
vexation
you
make
me
tired
talking
as
though
i
were
objecting
or
hindering
you
i
was
just
discussing
it
gloria
ca
i
discuss
i
should
think
you
be
strong
enough
to
settle
something
with
you
without
your
own
problems
without
coming
to
me
you
a
lot
about
going
to
work
i
could
use
more
money
very
easily
but
not
complaining
whether
you
work
or
not
i
love
you
her
last
words
were
gentle
as
fine
snow
upon
hard
ground
but
for
the
moment
neither
was
attending
to
the
other
they
were
each
engaged
in
polishing
and
perfecting
his
own
attitude
i
have
worked
some
this
by
anthony
was
an
imprudent
bringing
up
of
raw
reserves
gloria
laughed
torn
between
delight
and
derision
she
resented
his
sophistry
as
at
the
same
time
she
admired
his
nonchalance
she
would
never
blame
him
for
being
the
ineffectual
idler
so
long
as
he
did
it
sincerely
from
the
attitude
that
nothing
much
was
worth
doing
work
she
scoffed
oh
you
sad
bird
you
bluffer
work
that
means
a
great
arranging
of
the
desk
and
the
lights
a
great
sharpening
of
pencils
and
do
sing
and
keep
that
damn
tana
away
from
me
and
me
read
you
my
opening
sentence
and
wo
be
through
for
a
long
time
gloria
so
do
stay
up
for
me
and
a
tremendous
consumption
of
tea
or
coffee
and
that
all
in
just
about
an
hour
i
hear
the
old
pencil
stop
scratching
and
look
over
you
got
out
a
book
and
you
up
something
then
you
reading
then
yawns
then
bed
and
a
great
tossing
about
because
you
all
full
of
caffeine
and
ca
sleep
two
weeks
later
the
whole
performance
over
again
with
much
difficulty
anthony
retained
a
scanty
of
dignity
now
that
a
exaggeration
you
know
i
sold
an
essay
to
the
florentine
and
it
attracted
a
lot
of
attention
considering
the
circulation
of
the
florentine
and
what
more
gloria
you
know
i
sat
up
till
five
in
the
morning
finishing
it
she
lapsed
into
silence
giving
him
rope
and
if
he
had
not
hanged
himself
he
had
certainly
come
to
the
end
of
it
at
least
he
concluded
feebly
i
perfectly
willing
to
be
a
war
correspondent
but
so
was
gloria
they
were
both
willing
anxious
they
assured
each
other
of
it
the
evening
ended
on
a
note
of
tremendous
sentiment
the
majesty
of
leisure
the
ill
health
of
adam
patch
love
at
any
cost
anthony
she
called
over
the
banister
one
afternoon
a
week
later
there
some
one
at
the
door
anthony
who
had
been
lolling
in
the
hammock
on
the
south
porch
strolled
around
to
the
front
of
the
house
a
foreign
car
large
and
impressive
crouched
like
an
immense
and
saturnine
bug
at
the
foot
of
the
path
a
man
in
a
soft
pongee
suit
with
cap
to
match
hailed
him
hello
there
patch
ran
over
to
call
on
you
it
was
bloeckman
as
always
infinitesimally
improved
of
subtler
intonation
of
more
convincing
ease
i
awfully
glad
you
did
anthony
raised
his
voice
to
a
window
we
got
a
visitor
i
in
the
tub
wailed
gloria
politely
with
a
smile
the
two
men
acknowledged
the
triumph
of
her
alibi
she
be
down
come
round
here
on
the
like
a
drink
gloria
always
in
the
tub
good
third
of
every
day
pity
she
does
live
on
the
sound
ca
afford
it
as
coming
from
adam
patch
grandson
bloeckman
took
this
as
a
form
of
pleasantry
after
fifteen
minutes
filled
with
estimable
brilliancies
gloria
appeared
fresh
in
starched
yellow
bringing
atmosphere
and
an
increase
of
vitality
i
want
to
be
a
successful
sensation
in
the
movies
she
announced
i
hear
that
mary
pickford
makes
a
million
dollars
annually
you
could
you
know
said
bloeckman
i
think
you
film
very
well
would
you
let
me
anthony
if
i
only
play
unsophisticated
rôles
as
the
conversation
continued
in
stilted
commas
anthony
wondered
that
to
him
and
bloeckman
both
this
girl
had
once
been
the
most
stimulating
the
most
tonic
personality
they
had
ever
known
and
now
the
three
sat
like
overoiled
machines
without
conflict
without
fear
without
elation
heavily
enamelled
little
figures
secure
beyond
enjoyment
in
a
world
where
death
and
war
dull
emotion
and
noble
savagery
were
covering
a
continent
with
the
smoke
of
terror
in
a
moment
he
would
call
tana
and
they
would
pour
into
themselves
a
gay
and
delicate
poison
which
would
restore
them
momentarily
to
the
pleasurable
excitement
of
childhood
when
every
face
in
a
crowd
had
carried
its
suggestion
of
splendid
and
significant
transactions
taking
place
somewhere
to
some
magnificent
and
illimitable
purpose
life
was
no
more
than
this
summer
afternoon
a
faint
wind
stirring
the
lace
collar
of
gloria
dress
the
slow
baking
drowsiness
of
the
veranda
intolerably
unmoved
they
all
seemed
removed
from
any
romantic
imminency
of
action
even
gloria
beauty
needed
wild
emotions
needed
poignancy
needed
death
any
day
next
week
bloeckman
was
saying
to
gloria
here
take
this
card
what
they
do
is
to
give
you
a
test
of
about
three
hundred
feet
of
film
and
they
can
tell
pretty
accurately
from
that
how
about
wednesday
wednesday
fine
just
phone
me
and
i
go
around
with
you
he
was
on
his
feet
shaking
hands
briskly
then
his
car
was
a
wraith
of
dust
down
the
road
anthony
turned
to
his
wife
in
bewilderment
why
gloria
you
do
mind
if
i
have
a
trial
anthony
just
a
trial
i
got
to
go
to
town
wednesday
but
it
so
silly
you
do
want
to
go
into
the
movies
moon
around
a
studio
all
day
with
a
lot
of
cheap
chorus
people
lot
of
mooning
around
mary
pickford
does
everybody
is
a
mary
pickford
well
i
ca
see
how
you
object
to
my
i
do
though
i
hate
actors
oh
you
make
me
tired
do
you
imagine
i
have
a
very
thrilling
time
dozing
on
this
damn
porch
you
would
mind
if
you
loved
me
of
course
i
love
you
she
said
impatiently
making
out
a
quick
case
for
herself
it
just
because
i
do
that
i
hate
to
see
you
go
to
pieces
by
just
lying
around
and
saying
you
ought
to
work
perhaps
if
i
go
into
this
for
a
while
it
stir
you
up
so
you
do
something
it
just
your
craving
for
excitement
that
all
it
is
maybe
it
is
it
a
perfectly
natural
craving
is
it
well
i
tell
you
one
thing
if
you
go
to
the
movies
i
going
to
europe
well
go
on
then
not
stopping
you
to
show
she
was
not
stopping
him
she
melted
into
melancholy
tears
together
they
marshalled
the
armies
of
sentiment
words
kisses
endearments
they
attained
nothing
inevitably
they
attained
nothing
finally
in
a
burst
of
gargantuan
emotion
each
of
them
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
anthony
was
to
his
grandfather
was
to
joseph
bloeckman
it
was
a
triumph
of
lethargy
one
day
early
in
july
anthony
returned
from
an
afternoon
in
new
york
called
to
gloria
receiving
no
answer
he
guessed
she
was
asleep
and
so
went
into
the
pantry
for
one
of
the
little
sandwiches
that
were
always
prepared
for
them
he
found
tana
seated
at
the
kitchen
table
before
a
miscellaneous
assortment
of
odds
and
ends
knives
pencils
the
tops
of
cans
and
some
scraps
of
paper
covered
with
elaborate
figures
and
diagrams
what
the
devil
you
doing
demanded
anthony
curiously
tana
politely
grinned
i
show

he
exclaimed
enthusiastically

no

tana
grinned
again

tell
anthony
munching
a
sandwich
leaned
leisurely
against
the
sink
tana
opened
and
closed
his
mouth
several
times
as
though
testing
its
capacity
for
action
then
with
a
rush
he
began
i
been
think
typewutta

many
many
many
keys

screwed
his
face
up
in
a
tremendous
effort
to
express
himself

like

laughed
disparagingly

he
screwed
up
his
face
for
action

he
pointed
to
the
miscellany
of
junk
on
the
table
i
mean
mrs
patch
she
out
tana
reassured
him
she
be
back

she
say

in
the
village

went
off
before
lunch
she
go
mr
bloeckman
anthony
started
went
out
with
mr
bloeckman
she
be
back
five
without
a
word
anthony
left
the
kitchen
with
tana
disconsolate
i
tell
trailing
after
him
so
this
was
gloria
idea
of
excitement
by
god
his
fists
were
clenched
within
a
moment
he
had
worked
himself
up
to
a
tremendous
pitch
of
indignation
he
went
to
the
door
and
looked
out
there
was
no
car
in
sight
and
his
watch
stood
at
four
minutes
of
five
with
furious
energy
he
dashed
down
to
the
end
of
the
path
as
far
as
the
bend
of
the
road
a
mile
off
he
could
see
no
car
except
but
it
was
a
farmer
flivver
then
in
an
undignified
pursuit
of
dignity
he
rushed
back
to
the
shelter
of
the
house
as
quickly
as
he
had
rushed
out
pacing
up
and
down
the
living
room
he
began
an
angry
rehearsal
of
the
speech
he
would
make
to
her
when
she
came
in
so
this
is
love
he
would
begin
or
no
it
sounded
too
much
like
the
popular
phrase
so
this
is
paris
he
must
be
dignified
hurt
grieved
anyhow
so
this
is
what
do
when
i
have
to
go
up
and
trot
all
day
around
the
hot
city
on
business
no
wonder
i
ca
write
no
wonder
i
do
dare
let
you
out
of
my
sight
he
was
expanding
now
warming
to
his
subject
i
tell
you
he
continued
i
tell
you
he
paused
catching
a
familiar
ring
in
the
words
then
he
realized
it
was
tana
i
tell
yet
anthony
neither
laughed
nor
seemed
absurd
to
himself
to
his
frantic
imagination
it
was
already
six
seven
eight
and
she
was
never
coming
bloeckman
finding
her
bored
and
unhappy
had
persuaded
her
to
go
to
california
with
him
there
was
a
great
out
in
front
a
joyous
yoho
anthony
and
he
rose
trembling
weakly
happy
to
see
her
fluttering
up
the
path
bloeckman
was
following
cap
in
hand
dearest
she
cried
we
been
for
the
best
jaunt
all
over
new
york
state
i
have
to
be
starting
home
said
bloeckman
almost
immediately
wish
you
both
been
here
when
i
came
i
sorry
i
was
answered
anthony
dryly
when
he
had
departed
anthony
hesitated
the
fear
was
gone
from
his
heart
yet
he
felt
that
some
protest
was
ethically
apropos
gloria
resolved
his
uncertainty
i
knew
you
would
mind
he
came
just
before
lunch
and
said
he
had
to
go
to
garrison
on
business
and
would
i
go
with
him
he
looked
so
lonesome
anthony
and
i
drove
his
car
all
the
way
listlessly
anthony
dropped
into
a
chair
his
mind
tired
tired
with
nothing
tired
with
everything
with
the
world
weight
he
had
never
chosen
to
bear
he
was
ineffectual
and
vaguely
helpless
here
as
he
had
always
been
one
of
those
personalities
who
in
spite
of
all
their
words
are
inarticulate
he
seemed
to
have
inherited
only
the
vast
tradition
of
human
failure
that
and
the
sense
of
death
i
suppose
i
do
care
he
answered
one
must
be
broad
about
these
things
and
gloria
being
young
being
beautiful
must
have
reasonable
privileges
yet
it
wearied
him
that
he
failed
to
understand
winter
she
rolled
over
on
her
back
and
lay
still
for
a
moment
in
the
great
bed
watching
the
february
sun
suffer
one
last
attenuated
refinement
in
its
passage
through
the
leaded
panes
into
the
room
for
a
time
she
had
no
accurate
sense
of
her
whereabouts
or
of
the
events
of
the
day
before
or
the
day
before
that
then
like
a
suspended
pendulum
memory
began
to
beat
out
its
story
releasing
with
each
swing
a
burdened
quota
of
time
until
her
life
was
given
back
to
her
she
could
hear
now
anthony
troubled
breathing
beside
her
she
could
smell
whiskey
and
cigarette
smoke
she
noticed
that
she
lacked
complete
muscular
control
when
she
moved
it
was
not
a
sinuous
motion
with
the
resultant
strain
distributed
easily
over
her
body
it
was
a
tremendous
effort
of
her
nervous
system
as
though
each
time
she
were
hypnotizing
herself
into
performing
an
impossible
action
she
was
in
the
bathroom
brushing
her
teeth
to
get
rid
of
that
intolerable
taste
then
back
by
the
bedside
listening
to
the
rattle
of
bounds
key
in
the
outer
door
wake
up
anthony
she
said
sharply
she
climbed
into
bed
beside
him
and
closed
her
eyes
almost
the
last
thing
she
remembered
was
a
conversation
with
and
lacy
lacy
had
said
sure
you
do
want
us
to
get
you
a
taxi
and
anthony
had
replied
that
he
guessed
they
could
walk
over
to
fifth
all
right
then
they
had
both
attempted
imprudently
to
bow
and
collapsed
absurdly
into
a
battalion
of
empty
milk
bottles
just
outside
the
door
there
must
have
been
two
dozen
milk
bottles
standing
in
the
dark
she
could
conceive
of
no
plausible
explanation
of
those
milk
bottles
perhaps
they
had
been
attracted
by
the
singing
in
the
lacy
house
and
had
hurried
over
agape
with
wonder
to
see
the
fun
well
they
had
the
worst
of
it
though
it
seemed
that
she
and
anthony
never
would
get
up
the
perverse
things
rolled
so
still
they
had
found
a
taxi
my
meter
broken
and
it
cost
you
a
dollar
and
a
half
to
get
home
said
the
taxi
driver
well
said
anthony
i
young
packy
mcfarland
and
if
you
come
down
here
beat
you
till
you
ca
stand
up
at
that
point
the
man
had
driven
off
without
them
they
must
have
found
another
taxi
for
they
were
in
the
apartment
what
time
is
it
anthony
was
sitting
up
in
bed
staring
at
her
with
owlish
precision
this
was
obviously
a
rhetorical
question
gloria
could
think
of
no
reason
why
she
should
be
expected
to
know
the
time
golly
i
feel
like
the
devil
muttered
anthony
dispassionately
relaxing
he
tumbled
back
upon
his
pillow
bring
on
your
grim
reaper
anthony
how
we
finally
get
home
last
night
taxi
oh
then
after
a
pause
did
you
put
me
to
bed
i
do
know
seems
to
me
you
put
to
bed
what
day
is
it
tuesday
tuesday
i
hope
so
if
it
wednesday
i
got
to
start
work
at
that
idiotic
place
supposed
to
be
down
at
nine
or
some
such
ungodly
hour
ask
bounds
suggested
gloria
feebly
bounds
he
called
sprightly
sober
a
voice
from
a
world
that
it
seemed
in
the
past
two
days
they
had
left
forever
bounds
sprang
in
short
steps
down
the
hall
and
appeared
in
the
half
darkness
of
the
door
what
day
bounds
february
the
i
think
sir
i
mean
day
of
the
week
tuesday
sir
thanks
after
a
pause
are
you
ready
for
breakfast
sir
yes
and
bounds
before
you
get
it
will
you
make
a
pitcher
of
water
and
set
it
here
beside
the
bed
i
a
little
thirsty
yes
sir
bounds
retreated
in
sober
dignity
down
the
hallway
lincoln
birthday
affirmed
anthony
without
enthusiasm
or
valentine
or
somebody
when
did
we
start
on
this
insane
party
sunday
night
after
prayers
he
suggested
sardonically
we
raced
all
over
town
in
those
hansoms
and
maury
sat
up
with
his
driver
do
you
remember
then
we
came
home
and
he
tried
to
cook
some
bacon
came
out
of
the
pantry
with
a
few
blackened
remains
insisting
it
was
to
the
proverbial
crisp
both
of
them
laughed
spontaneously
but
with
some
difficulty
and
lying
there
side
by
side
reviewed
the
chain
of
events
that
had
ended
in
this
rusty
and
chaotic
dawn
they
had
been
in
new
york
for
almost
four
months
since
the
country
had
grown
too
cool
in
late
october
they
had
given
up
california
this
year
partly
because
of
lack
of
funds
partly
with
the
idea
of
going
abroad
should
this
interminable
war
persisting
now
into
its
second
year
end
during
the
winter
of
late
their
income
had
lost
elasticity
no
longer
did
it
stretch
to
cover
gay
whims
and
pleasant
extravagances
and
anthony
had
spent
many
puzzled
and
unsatisfactory
hours
over
a
densely
figured
pad
making
remarkable
budgets
that
left
huge
margins
for
amusements
trips
and
trying
to
apportion
even
approximately
their
past
expenditures
he
remembered
a
time
when
in
going
on
a
party
with
his
two
best
friends
he
and
maury
had
invariably
paid
more
than
their
share
of
the
expenses
they
would
buy
the
tickets
for
the
theatre
or
squabble
between
themselves
for
the
dinner
check
it
had
seemed
fitting
dick
with
his
naïveté
and
his
astonishing
fund
of
information
about
himself
had
been
a
diverting
almost
juvenile
figure
court
jester
to
their
royalty
but
this
was
no
longer
true
it
was
dick
who
always
had
money
it
was
anthony
who
entertained
within
limitations
always
excepting
occasional
wild
parties
and
it
was
anthony
who
was
solemn
about
it
next
morning
and
told
the
scornful
and
disgusted
gloria
that
they
have
to
be
more
careful
next
time
in
the
two
years
since
the
publication
of
the
demon
lover
dick
had
made
over
thousand
dollars
most
of
it
lately
when
the
reward
of
the
author
of
fiction
had
begun
to
swell
unprecedentedly
as
a
result
of
the
voracious
hunger
of
the
motion
pictures
for
plots
he
received
seven
hundred
dollars
for
every
story
at
that
time
a
large
emolument
for
such
a
young
man
he
was
not
quite
thirty
and
for
every
one
that
contained
enough
action
kissing
shooting
and
sacrificing
for
the
movies
he
obtained
an
additional
thousand
his
stories
varied
there
was
a
measure
of
vitality
and
a
sort
of
instinctive
in
all
of
them
but
none
attained
the
personality
of
the
demon
lover
and
there
were
several
that
anthony
considered
downright
cheap
these
dick
explained
severely
were
to
widen
his
audience
was
it
true
that
men
who
had
attained
real
permanence
from
shakespeare
to
mark
twain
had
appealed
to
the
many
as
well
as
to
the
elect
though
anthony
and
maury
disagreed
gloria
told
him
to
go
ahead
and
make
as
much
money
as
he
could
that
was
the
only
thing
that
counted
anyhow
maury
a
little
stouter
faintly
mellower
and
more
complaisant
had
gone
to
work
in
philadelphia
he
came
to
new
york
once
or
twice
a
month
and
on
such
occasions
the
four
of
them
travelled
the
popular
routes
from
dinner
to
the
theatre
thence
to
the
frolic
or
perhaps
at
the
urging
of
the
gloria
to
one
of
the
cellars
of
greenwich
village
notorious
through
the
furious
but
vogue
of
the
new
poetry
movement
in
january
after
many
monologues
directed
at
his
reticent
wife
anthony
determined
to
get
something
to
do
for
the
winter
at
any
rate
he
wanted
to
please
his
grandfather
and
even
in
a
measure
to
see
how
he
liked
it
himself
he
discovered
during
several
tentative
calls
that
employers
were
not
interested
in
a
young
man
who
was
only
going
to
try
it
for
a
few
months
or
so
as
the
grandson
of
adam
patch
he
was
received
everywhere
with
marked
courtesy
but
the
old
man
was
a
back
number
now
the
heyday
of
his
fame
as
first
an
oppressor
and
then
an
uplifter
of
the
people
had
been
during
the
twenty
years
preceding
his
retirement
anthony
even
found
several
of
the
younger
men
who
were
under
the
impression
that
adam
patch
had
been
dead
for
some
years
eventually
anthony
went
to
his
grandfather
and
asked
his
advice
which
turned
out
to
be
that
he
should
enter
the
bond
business
as
a
salesman
a
tedious
suggestion
to
anthony
but
one
that
in
the
end
he
determined
to
follow
sheer
money
in
deft
manipulation
had
fascinations
under
all
circumstances
while
almost
any
side
of
manufacturing
would
be
insufferably
dull
he
considered
newspaper
work
but
decided
that
the
hours
were
not
ordered
for
a
married
man
and
he
lingered
over
pleasant
fancies
of
himself
either
as
editor
of
a
brilliant
weekly
of
opinion
an
american
mercure
de
france
or
as
scintillant
producer
of
satiric
comedy
and
parisian
musical
revue
however
the
approaches
to
these
latter
guilds
seemed
to
be
guarded
by
professional
secrets
men
drifted
into
them
by
the
devious
highways
of
writing
and
acting
it
was
palpably
impossible
to
get
on
a
magazine
unless
you
had
been
on
one
before
so
in
the
end
he
entered
by
way
of
his
grandfather
letter
that
sanctum
americanum
where
sat
the
president
of
wilson
hiemer
and
hardy
at
his
cleared
desk
and
issued
therefrom
employed
he
was
to
begin
work
on
the
of
february
in
tribute
to
the
momentous
occasion
this
revel
had
been
planned
since
he
said
after
he
began
working
he
have
to
get
to
bed
early
during
the
week
maury
noble
had
arrived
from
philadelphia
on
a
trip
that
had
to
do
with
seeing
some
man
in
wall
street
whom
incidentally
he
failed
to
see
and
richard
caramel
had
been
half
persuaded
half
tricked
into
joining
them
they
had
condescended
to
a
wet
and
fashionable
wedding
on
monday
afternoon
and
in
the
evening
had
occurred
the
dénouement
gloria
going
beyond
her
accustomed
limit
of
four
precisely
timed
cocktails
led
them
on
as
gay
and
joyous
a
bacchanal
as
they
had
ever
known
disclosing
an
astonishing
knowledge
of
ballet
steps
and
singing
songs
which
she
confessed
had
been
taught
her
by
her
cook
when
she
was
innocent
and
seventeen
she
repeated
these
by
request
at
intervals
throughout
the
evening
with
such
frank
conviviality
that
anthony
far
from
being
annoyed
was
gratified
at
this
fresh
source
of
entertainment
the
occasion
was
memorable
in
other
ways
a
long
conversation
between
maury
and
a
defunct
crab
which
he
was
dragging
around
on
the
end
of
a
string
as
to
whether
the
crab
was
fully
conversant
with
the
applications
of
the
binomial
theorem
and
the
aforementioned
race
in
two
hansom
cabs
with
the
sedate
and
impressive
shadows
of
fifth
avenue
for
audience
ending
in
a
labyrinthine
escape
into
the
darkness
of
central
park
finally
anthony
and
gloria
had
paid
a
call
on
some
wild
young
married
people
the
lacys
and
collapsed
in
the
empty
milk
bottles
morning
now
theirs
to
add
up
the
checks
cashed
here
and
there
in
clubs
stores
restaurants
theirs
to
air
the
dank
staleness
of
wine
and
cigarettes
out
of
the
tall
blue
front
room
to
pick
up
the
broken
glass
and
brush
at
the
stained
fabric
of
chairs
and
sofas
to
give
bounds
suits
and
dresses
for
the
cleaners
finally
to
take
their
smothery
bodies
and
faded
depressed
spirits
out
into
the
chill
air
of
february
that
life
might
go
on
and
wilson
hiemer
and
hardy
obtain
the
services
of
a
vigorous
man
at
nine
next
morning
do
you
remember
called
anthony
from
the
bathroom
when
maury
got
out
at
the
corner
of
one
hundred
and
tenth
street
and
acted
as
a
traffic
cop
beckoning
cars
forward
and
motioning
them
back
they
must
have
thought
he
was
a
private
detective
after
each
reminiscence
they
both
laughed
inordinately
their
overwrought
nerves
responding
as
acutely
and
janglingly
to
mirth
as
to
depression
gloria
at
the
mirror
was
wondering
at
the
splendid
color
and
freshness
of
her
face
it
seemed
that
she
had
never
looked
so
well
though
her
stomach
hurt
her
and
her
head
was
aching
furiously
the
day
passed
slowly
anthony
riding
in
a
taxi
to
his
broker
to
borrow
money
on
a
bond
found
that
he
had
only
two
dollars
in
his
pocket
the
fare
would
cost
all
of
that
but
he
felt
that
on
this
particular
afternoon
he
could
not
have
endured
the
subway
when
the
taximetre
reached
his
limit
he
must
get
out
and
walk
with
this
his
mind
drifted
off
into
one
of
its
characteristic
in
this
dream
he
discovered
that
the
metre
was
going
too
fast
the
driver
had
dishonestly
adjusted
it
calmly
he
reached
his
destination
and
then
nonchalantly
handed
the
man
what
he
justly
owed
him
the
man
showed
fight
but
almost
before
his
hands
were
up
anthony
had
knocked
him
down
with
one
terrific
blow
and
when
he
rose
anthony
quickly
sidestepped
and
floored
him
definitely
with
a
crack
in
the
temple
he
was
in
court
now
the
judge
had
fined
him
five
dollars
and
he
had
no
money
would
the
court
take
his
check
ah
but
the
court
did
not
know
him
well
he
could
identify
himself
by
having
them
call
his
apartment
they
did
so
yes
it
was
anthony
patch
speaking
but
how
did
she
know
that
this
man
was
her
husband
how
could
she
know
let
the
police
sergeant
ask
her
if
she
remembered
the
milk
bottles
he
leaned
forward
hurriedly
and
tapped
at
the
glass
the
taxi
was
only
at
brooklyn
bridge
but
the
metre
showed
a
dollar
and
eighty
cents
and
anthony
would
never
have
omitted
the
ten
per
cent
tip
later
in
the
afternoon
he
returned
to
the
apartment
gloria
had
also
been
out
shopping
and
was
asleep
curled
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
with
her
purchase
locked
securely
in
her
arms
her
face
was
as
untroubled
as
a
little
girl
and
the
bundle
that
she
pressed
tightly
to
her
bosom
was
a
child
doll
a
profound
and
infinitely
healing
balm
to
her
disturbed
and
childish
heart
destiny
it
was
with
this
party
more
especially
with
gloria
part
in
it
that
a
decided
change
began
to
come
over
their
way
of
living
the
magnificent
attitude
of
not
giving
a
damn
altered
overnight
from
being
a
mere
tenet
of
gloria
it
became
the
entire
solace
and
justification
for
what
they
chose
to
do
and
what
consequence
it
brought
not
to
be
sorry
not
to
loose
one
cry
of
regret
to
live
according
to
a
clear
code
of
honor
toward
each
other
and
to
seek
the
moment
happiness
as
fervently
and
persistently
as
possible
no
one
cares
about
us
but
ourselves
anthony
she
said
one
day
be
ridiculous
for
me
to
go
about
pretending
i
felt
any
obligations
toward
the
world
and
as
for
worrying
what
people
think
about
me
i
simply
that
all
since
i
was
a
little
girl
in
i
been
criticised
by
the
mothers
of
all
the
little
girls
who
as
popular
as
i
was
and
i
always
looked
on
criticism
as
a
sort
of
envious
tribute
this
was
because
of
a
party
in
the
boul
mich
one
night
where
constance
merriam
had
seen
her
as
one
of
a
highly
stimulated
party
of
four
constance
merriam
as
an
old
school
friend
had
gone
to
the
trouble
of
inviting
her
to
lunch
next
day
in
order
to
inform
her
how
terrible
it
was
i
told
her
i
could
see
it
gloria
told
anthony
eric
merriam
is
a
sort
of
sublimated
percy
wolcott
you
remember
that
man
in
hot
springs
i
told
you
about
his
idea
of
respecting
constance
is
to
leave
her
at
home
with
her
sewing
and
her
baby
and
her
book
and
such
innocuous
amusements
whenever
he
going
on
a
party
that
promises
to
be
anything
but
deathly
dull
did
you
tell
her
that
i
certainly
did
and
i
told
her
that
what
she
really
objected
to
was
that
i
was
having
a
better
time
than
she
was
anthony
applauded
her
he
was
tremendously
proud
of
gloria
proud
that
she
never
failed
to
eclipse
whatever
other
women
might
be
in
the
party
proud
that
men
were
always
glad
to
revel
with
her
in
great
rowdy
groups
without
any
attempt
to
do
more
than
enjoy
her
beauty
and
the
warmth
of
her
vitality
these
parties
gradually
became
their
chief
source
of
entertainment
still
in
love
still
enormously
interested
in
each
other
they
yet
found
as
spring
drew
near
that
staying
at
home
in
the
evening
palled
on
them
books
were
unreal
the
old
magic
of
being
alone
had
long
since
vanished
instead
they
preferred
to
be
bored
by
a
stupid
musical
comedy
or
to
go
to
dinner
with
the
most
uninteresting
of
their
acquaintances
so
long
as
there
would
be
enough
cocktails
to
keep
the
conversation
from
becoming
utterly
intolerable
a
scattering
of
younger
married
people
who
had
been
their
friends
in
school
or
college
as
well
as
a
varied
assortment
of
single
men
began
to
think
instinctively
of
them
whenever
color
and
excitement
were
needed
so
there
was
scarcely
a
day
without
its
phone
call
its
wondered
what
you
were
doing
this
evening
wives
as
a
rule
were
afraid
of
gloria
her
facile
attainment
of
the
centre
of
the
stage
her
innocent
but
nevertheless
disturbing
way
of
becoming
a
favorite
with
husbands
these
things
drove
them
instinctively
into
an
attitude
of
profound
distrust
heightened
by
the
fact
that
gloria
was
largely
unresponsive
to
any
intimacy
shown
her
by
a
woman
on
the
appointed
wednesday
in
february
anthony
had
gone
to
the
imposing
offices
of
wilson
hiemer
and
hardy
and
listened
to
many
vague
instructions
delivered
by
an
energetic
young
man
of
about
his
own
age
named
kahler
who
wore
a
defiant
yellow
pompadour
and
in
announcing
himself
as
an
assistant
secretary
gave
the
impression
that
it
was
a
tribute
to
exceptional
ability
there
two
kinds
of
men
here
you
find
he
said
there
the
man
who
gets
to
be
an
assistant
secretary
or
treasurer
gets
his
name
on
our
folder
here
before
he
thirty
and
there
the
man
who
gets
his
name
there
at
the
man
who
gets
his
name
there
at
stays
there
the
rest
of
his
life
how
about
the
man
who
gets
it
there
at
thirty
inquired
anthony
politely
why
he
gets
up
here
you
see
he
pointed
to
a
list
of
assistant
upon
the
folder
or
maybe
he
gets
to
be
president
or
secretary
or
treasurer
and
what
about
these
over
here
those
oh
those
are
the
trustees
the
men
with
capital
i
see
now
some
people
continued
kahler
think
that
whether
a
man
gets
started
early
or
late
depends
on
whether
he
got
a
college
education
but
they
wrong
i
see
i
had
one
i
was
buckleigh
class
of
but
when
i
came
down
to
the
street
i
soon
found
that
the
things
that
would
help
me
here
were
the
fancy
things
i
learned
in
college
in
fact
i
had
to
get
a
lot
of
fancy
stuff
out
of
my
head
anthony
could
not
help
wondering
what
possible
fancy
stuff
he
had
learned
at
buckleigh
in
an
irrepressible
idea
that
it
was
some
sort
of
needlework
recurred
to
him
throughout
the
rest
of
the
conversation
see
that
fellow
over
there
kahler
pointed
to
a
man
with
handsome
gray
hair
sitting
at
a
desk
inside
a
mahogany
railing
that
ellinger
the
first
been
everywhere
seen
everything
got
a
fine
education
in
vain
did
anthony
try
to
open
his
mind
to
the
romance
of
finance
he
could
think
of
ellinger
only
as
one
of
the
buyers
of
the
handsome
leather
sets
of
thackeray
balzac
hugo
and
gibbon
that
lined
the
walls
of
the
big
bookstores
through
the
damp
and
uninspiring
month
of
march
he
was
prepared
for
salesmanship
lacking
enthusiasm
he
was
capable
of
viewing
the
turmoil
and
bustle
that
surrounded
him
only
as
a
fruitless
circumambient
striving
toward
an
incomprehensible
goal
tangibly
evidenced
only
by
the
rival
mansions
of
frick
and
carnegie
on
fifth
avenue
that
these
portentous
and
trustees
should
be
actually
the
fathers
of
the
best
men
he
had
known
at
harvard
seemed
to
him
incongruous
he
ate
in
an
employees
with
an
uneasy
suspicion
that
he
was
being
uplifted
wondering
through
that
first
week
if
the
dozens
of
young
clerks
some
of
them
alert
and
immaculate
and
just
out
of
college
lived
in
flamboyant
hope
of
crowding
onto
that
narrow
slip
of
cardboard
before
the
catastrophic
thirties
the
conversation
that
interwove
with
the
pattern
of
the
day
work
was
all
much
of
a
piece
one
discussed
how
wilson
had
made
his
money
what
method
hiemer
had
employed
and
the
means
resorted
to
by
hardy
one
related
but
eternally
breathless
anecdotes
of
the
fortunes
stumbled
on
precipitously
in
the
street
by
a
butcher
or
a
bartender
or
a
darn
boy
by
golly
and
then
one
talked
of
the
current
gambles
and
whether
it
was
best
to
go
out
for
a
hundred
thousand
a
year
or
be
content
with
twenty
during
the
preceding
year
one
of
the
assistant
secretaries
had
invested
all
his
savings
in
bethlehem
steel
the
story
of
his
spectacular
magnificence
of
his
haughty
resignation
in
january
and
of
the
triumphal
palace
he
was
now
building
in
california
was
the
favorite
office
subject
the
man
very
name
had
acquired
a
magic
significance
symbolizing
as
he
did
the
aspirations
of
all
good
americans
anecdotes
were
told
about
him
how
one
of
the
had
advised
him
to
sell
by
golly
but
he
had
hung
on
even
bought
on
margin
and
look
where
he
is
such
obviously
was
the
stuff
of
life
a
dizzy
triumph
dazzling
the
eyes
of
all
of
them
a
gypsy
siren
to
content
them
with
meagre
wage
and
with
the
arithmetical
improbability
of
their
eventual
success
to
anthony
the
notion
became
appalling
he
felt
that
to
succeed
here
the
idea
of
success
must
grasp
and
limit
his
mind
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
essential
element
in
these
men
at
the
top
was
their
faith
that
their
affairs
were
the
very
core
of
life
all
other
things
being
equal
and
opportunism
won
out
over
technical
knowledge
it
was
obvious
that
the
more
expert
work
went
on
near
the
bottom
so
with
appropriate
efficiency
the
technical
experts
were
kept
there
his
determination
to
stay
in
at
night
during
the
week
did
not
survive
and
a
good
half
of
the
time
he
came
to
work
with
a
splitting
sickish
headache
and
the
crowded
horror
of
the
morning
subway
ringing
in
his
ears
like
an
echo
of
hell
then
abruptly
he
quit
he
had
remained
in
bed
all
one
monday
and
late
in
the
evening
overcome
by
one
of
those
attacks
of
moody
despair
to
which
he
periodically
succumbed
he
wrote
and
mailed
a
letter
to
wilson
confessing
that
he
considered
himself
ill
adapted
to
the
work
gloria
coming
in
from
the
theatre
with
richard
caramel
found
him
on
the
lounge
silently
staring
at
the
high
ceiling
more
depressed
and
discouraged
than
he
had
been
at
any
time
since
their
marriage
she
wanted
him
to
whine
if
he
had
she
would
have
reproached
him
bitterly
for
she
was
not
a
little
annoyed
but
he
only
lay
there
so
utterly
miserable
that
she
felt
sorry
for
him
and
kneeling
down
she
stroked
his
head
saying
how
little
it
mattered
how
little
anything
mattered
so
long
as
they
loved
each
other
it
was
like
their
first
year
and
anthony
reacting
to
her
cool
hand
to
her
voice
that
was
soft
as
breath
itself
upon
his
ear
became
almost
cheerful
and
talked
with
her
of
his
future
plans
he
even
regretted
silently
before
he
went
to
bed
that
he
had
so
hastily
mailed
his
resignation
even
when
everything
seems
rotten
you
ca
trust
that
judgment
gloria
had
said
it
the
sum
of
all
your
judgments
that
counts
in
came
a
letter
from
the
agent
in
marietta
encouraging
them
to
take
the
gray
house
for
another
year
at
a
slightly
increased
rental
and
enclosing
a
lease
made
out
for
their
signatures
for
a
week
lease
and
letter
lay
carelessly
neglected
on
anthony
desk
they
had
no
intention
of
returning
to
marietta
they
were
weary
of
the
place
and
had
been
bored
most
of
the
preceding
summer
besides
their
car
had
deteriorated
to
a
rattling
mass
of
hypochondriacal
metal
and
a
new
one
was
financially
inadvisable
but
because
of
another
wild
revel
enduring
through
four
days
and
participated
in
at
one
time
or
another
by
more
than
a
dozen
people
they
did
sign
the
lease
to
their
utter
horror
they
signed
it
and
sent
it
and
immediately
it
seemed
as
though
they
heard
the
gray
house
drably
malevolent
at
last
licking
its
white
chops
and
waiting
to
devour
them
anthony
where
that
lease
she
called
in
high
alarm
one
sunday
morning
sick
and
sober
to
reality
where
did
you
leave
it
it
was
here
then
she
knew
where
it
was
she
remembered
the
house
party
they
had
planned
on
the
crest
of
their
exuberance
she
remembered
a
room
full
of
men
to
whose
less
exhilarated
moments
she
and
anthony
were
of
no
importance
and
anthony
boast
of
the
transcendent
merit
and
seclusion
of
the
gray
house
that
it
was
so
isolated
that
it
did
matter
how
much
noise
went
on
there
then
dick
who
had
visited
them
cried
enthusiastically
that
it
was
the
best
little
house
imaginable
and
that
they
were
idiotic
not
to
take
it
for
another
summer
it
had
been
easy
to
work
themselves
up
to
a
sense
of
how
hot
and
deserted
the
city
was
getting
of
how
cool
and
ambrosial
were
the
charms
of
marietta
anthony
had
picked
up
the
lease
and
waved
it
wildly
found
gloria
happily
acquiescent
and
with
one
last
burst
of
garrulous
decision
during
which
all
the
men
agreed
with
solemn
handshakes
that
they
would
come
out
for
a
visit
anthony
she
cried
we
signed
and
sent
it
what
the
lease
what
the
devil
oh
there
was
utter
misery
in
her
voice
for
the
summer
for
eternity
they
had
built
themselves
a
prison
it
seemed
to
strike
at
the
last
roots
of
their
stability
anthony
thought
they
might
arrange
it
with
the
agent
they
could
no
longer
afford
the
double
rent
and
going
to
marietta
meant
giving
up
his
apartment
his
reproachless
apartment
with
the
exquisite
bath
and
the
rooms
for
which
he
had
bought
his
furniture
and
hangings
it
was
the
closest
to
a
home
that
he
had
ever
had
familiar
with
memories
of
four
colorful
years
but
it
was
not
arranged
with
the
agent
nor
was
it
arranged
at
all
dispiritedly
without
even
any
talk
of
making
the
best
of
it
without
even
gloria
i
do
care
they
went
back
to
the
house
that
they
now
knew
heeded
neither
youth
nor
love
only
those
austere
and
incommunicable
memories
that
they
could
never
share
the
sinister
summer
there
was
a
horror
in
the
house
that
summer
it
came
with
them
and
settled
itself
over
the
place
like
a
sombre
pall
pervasive
through
the
lower
rooms
gradually
spreading
and
climbing
up
the
narrow
stairs
until
it
oppressed
their
very
sleep
anthony
and
gloria
grew
to
hate
being
there
alone
her
bedroom
which
had
seemed
so
pink
and
young
and
delicate
appropriate
to
her
lingerie
tossed
here
and
there
on
chair
and
bed
seemed
now
to
whisper
with
its
rustling
curtains
ah
my
beautiful
young
lady
yours
is
not
the
first
daintiness
and
delicacy
that
has
faded
here
under
the
summer
suns
generations
of
unloved
women
have
adorned
themselves
by
that
glass
for
rustic
lovers
who
paid
no
heed
youth
has
come
into
this
room
in
palest
blue
and
left
it
in
the
gray
cerements
of
despair
and
through
long
nights
many
girls
have
lain
awake
where
that
bed
stands
pouring
out
waves
of
misery
into
the
darkness
gloria
finally
tumbled
all
her
clothes
and
unguents
ingloriously
out
of
it
declaring
that
she
had
come
to
live
with
anthony
and
making
the
excuse
that
one
of
her
screens
was
rotten
and
admitted
bugs
so
her
room
was
abandoned
to
insensitive
guests
and
they
dressed
and
slept
in
her
husband
chamber
which
gloria
considered
somehow
good
as
though
anthony
presence
there
had
acted
as
exterminator
of
any
uneasy
shadows
of
the
past
that
might
have
hovered
about
its
walls
the
distinction
between
good
and
bad
ordered
early
and
summarily
out
of
both
their
lives
had
been
reinstated
in
another
form
gloria
insisted
that
any
one
invited
to
the
gray
house
must
be
good
which
in
the
case
of
a
girl
meant
that
she
must
be
either
simple
and
reproachless
or
if
otherwise
must
possess
a
certain
solidity
and
strength
always
intensely
sceptical
of
her
sex
her
judgments
were
now
concerned
with
the
question
of
whether
women
were
or
were
not
clean
by
uncleanliness
she
meant
a
variety
of
things
a
lack
of
pride
a
slackness
in
fibre
and
most
of
all
the
unmistakable
aura
of
promiscuity
women
soil
easily
she
said
far
more
easily
than
men
unless
a
girl
very
young
and
brave
it
almost
impossible
for
her
to
go
without
a
certain
hysterical
animality
the
cunning
dirty
sort
of
animality
a
man
different
and
i
suppose
that
why
one
of
the
commonest
characters
of
romance
is
a
man
going
gallantly
to
the
devil
she
was
disposed
to
like
many
men
preferably
those
who
gave
her
frank
homage
and
unfailing
entertainment
but
often
with
a
flash
of
insight
she
told
anthony
that
some
one
of
his
friends
was
merely
using
him
and
consequently
had
best
be
left
alone
anthony
customarily
demurred
insisting
that
the
accused
was
a
good
one
but
he
found
that
his
judgment
was
more
fallible
than
hers
memorably
when
as
it
happened
on
several
occasions
he
was
left
with
a
succession
of
restaurant
checks
for
which
to
render
a
solitary
account
more
from
their
fear
of
solitude
than
from
any
desire
to
go
through
the
fuss
and
bother
of
entertaining
they
filled
the
house
with
guests
every
and
often
on
through
the
week
the
parties
were
much
the
same
when
the
three
or
four
men
invited
had
arrived
drinking
was
more
or
less
in
order
followed
by
a
hilarious
dinner
and
a
ride
to
the
cradle
beach
country
club
which
they
had
joined
because
it
was
inexpensive
lively
if
not
fashionable
and
almost
a
necessity
for
just
such
occasions
as
these
moreover
it
was
of
no
great
moment
what
one
did
there
and
so
long
as
the
patch
party
were
reasonably
inaudible
it
mattered
little
whether
or
not
the
social
dictators
of
cradle
beach
saw
the
gay
gloria
imbibing
cocktails
in
the
supper
room
at
frequent
intervals
during
the
evening
saturday
ended
generally
in
a
glamourous
confusion
it
proving
often
necessary
to
assist
a
muddled
guest
to
bed
sunday
brought
the
new
york
papers
and
a
quiet
morning
of
recuperating
on
the
porch
and
sunday
afternoon
meant
to
the
one
or
two
guests
who
must
return
to
the
city
and
a
great
revival
of
drinking
among
the
one
or
two
who
remained
until
next
day
concluding
in
a
convivial
if
not
hilarious
evening
the
faithful
tana
pedagogue
by
nature
and
man
of
all
work
by
profession
had
returned
with
them
among
their
more
frequent
guests
a
tradition
had
sprung
up
about
him
maury
noble
remarked
one
afternoon
that
his
real
name
was
tannenbaum
and
that
he
was
a
german
agent
kept
in
this
country
to
disseminate
teutonic
propaganda
through
westchester
county
and
after
that
mysterious
letters
began
to
arrive
from
philadelphia
addressed
to
the
bewildered
oriental
as
emile
tannenbaum
containing
a
few
cryptic
messages
signed
general
staff
and
adorned
with
an
atmospheric
double
column
of
facetious
japanese
anthony
always
handed
them
to
tana
without
a
smile
hours
afterward
the
recipient
could
be
found
puzzling
over
them
in
the
kitchen
and
declaring
earnestly
that
the
perpendicular
symbols
were
not
japanese
nor
anything
resembling
japanese
gloria
had
taken
a
strong
dislike
to
the
man
ever
since
the
day
when
returning
unexpectedly
from
the
village
she
had
discovered
him
reclining
on
anthony
bed
puzzling
out
a
newspaper
it
was
the
instinct
of
all
servants
to
be
fond
of
anthony
and
to
detest
gloria
and
tana
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
but
he
was
thoroughly
afraid
of
her
and
made
plain
his
aversion
only
in
his
moodier
moments
by
subtly
addressing
anthony
with
remarks
intended
for
her
ear
what
miz
pats
want
dinner
he
would
say
looking
at
his
master
or
else
he
would
comment
about
the
bitter
selfishness
of
peoples
in
such
manner
that
there
was
no
doubt
who
were
the
peoples
referred
to
but
they
dared
not
dismiss
him
such
a
step
would
have
been
abhorrent
to
their
inertia
they
endured
tana
as
they
endured
ill
weather
and
sickness
of
the
body
and
the
estimable
will
of
god
as
they
endured
all
things
even
themselves
in
darkness
one
sultry
afternoon
late
in
july
richard
caramel
telephoned
from
new
york
that
he
and
maury
were
coming
out
bringing
a
friend
with
them
they
arrived
about
five
a
little
drunk
accompanied
by
a
small
stocky
man
of
whom
they
introduced
as
joe
hull
one
of
the
best
fellows
that
anthony
and
gloria
had
ever
met
joe
hull
had
a
yellow
beard
continually
fighting
through
his
skin
and
a
low
voice
which
varied
between
basso
profundo
and
a
husky
whisper
anthony
carrying
maury
suitcase
followed
into
the
room
and
carefully
closed
the
door
who
is
this
fellow
he
demanded
maury
chuckled
enthusiastically
who
hull
oh
all
right
he
a
good
one
yes
but
who
is
he
hull
he
just
a
good
fellow
he
a
prince
his
laughter
redoubled
culminating
in
a
succession
of
pleasant
catlike
grins
anthony
hesitated
between
a
smile
and
a
frown
he
looks
sort
of
funny
to
me
clothes
he
paused
got
a
sneaking
suspicion
you
two
picked
him
up
somewhere
last
night
ridiculous
declared
maury
why
i
known
him
all
my
life
however
as
he
capped
this
statement
with
another
series
of
chuckles
anthony
was
impelled
to
remark
the
devil
you
have
later
just
before
dinner
while
maury
and
dick
were
conversing
uproariously
with
joe
hull
listening
in
silence
as
he
sipped
his
drink
gloria
drew
anthony
into
the
dining
room
i
do
like
this
man
hull
she
said
i
wish
he
use
bathtub
i
ca
very
well
ask
him
to
well
i
do
want
him
in
ours
he
seems
to
be
a
simple
soul
he
got
on
white
shoes
that
look
like
gloves
i
can
see
his
toes
right
through
them
uh
who
is
he
anyway
you
got
me
well
i
think
they
got
their
nerve
to
bring
him
out
here
this
a
sailor
rescue
home
they
were
tight
when
they
phoned
maury
said
they
been
on
a
party
since
yesterday
afternoon
gloria
shook
her
head
angrily
and
saying
no
more
returned
to
the
porch
anthony
saw
that
she
was
trying
to
forget
her
uncertainty
and
devote
herself
to
enjoying
the
evening
it
had
been
a
tropical
day
and
even
into
late
twilight
the
emanating
from
the
dry
road
were
quivering
faintly
like
undulating
panes
of
isinglass
the
sky
was
cloudless
but
far
beyond
the
woods
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
a
faint
and
persistent
rolling
had
commenced
when
tana
announced
dinner
the
men
at
a
word
from
gloria
remained
coatless
and
went
inside
maury
began
a
song
which
they
accomplished
in
harmony
during
the
first
course
it
had
two
lines
and
was
sung
to
a
popular
air
called
daisy
dear
the
lines
were
the
has
come
over
us
so
the
moral
each
rendition
was
greeted
with
bursts
of
enthusiasm
and
prolonged
applause
cheer
up
gloria
suggested
maury
you
seem
the
least
bit
depressed
i
not
she
lied
here
tannenbaum
he
called
over
his
shoulder
i
filled
you
a
drink
come
on
gloria
tried
to
stay
his
arm
please
do
maury
why
not
maybe
he
play
the
flute
for
us
after
dinner
here
tana
tana
grinning
bore
the
glass
away
to
the
kitchen
in
a
few
moments
maury
gave
him
another
cheer
up
gloria
he
cried
for
heaven
sakes
everybody
cheer
up
gloria
dearest
have
another
drink
counselled
anthony
do
please
cheer
up
gloria
said
joe
hull
easily
gloria
winced
at
this
use
of
her
first
name
and
glanced
around
to
see
if
any
one
else
had
noticed
it
the
word
coming
so
glibly
from
the
lips
of
a
man
to
whom
she
had
taken
an
inordinate
dislike
repelled
her
a
moment
later
she
noticed
that
joe
hull
had
given
tana
another
drink
and
her
anger
increased
heightened
somewhat
from
the
effects
of
the
and
once
maury
was
saying
peter
granby
and
i
went
into
a
turkish
bath
in
boston
about
two
at
night
there
was
no
one
there
but
the
proprietor
and
we
jammed
him
into
a
closet
and
locked
the
door
then
a
fella
came
in
and
wanted
a
turkish
bath
thought
we
were
the
rubbers
by
golly
well
we
just
picked
him
up
and
tossed
him
into
the
pool
with
all
his
clothes
on
then
we
dragged
him
out
and
laid
him
on
a
slab
and
slapped
him
until
he
was
black
and
blue
so
rough
fellows
he
say
in
a
little
squeaky
voice
was
this
maury
thought
gloria
from
any
one
else
the
story
would
have
amused
her
but
from
maury
the
infinitely
appreciative
the
apotheosis
of
tact
and
consideration
the
has
come
over
us
so
a
drum
of
thunder
from
outside
drowned
out
the
rest
of
the
song
gloria
shivered
and
tried
to
empty
her
glass
but
the
first
taste
nauseated
her
and
she
set
it
down
dinner
was
over
and
they
all
marched
into
the
big
room
bearing
several
bottles
and
decanters
some
one
had
closed
the
porch
door
to
keep
out
the
wind
and
in
consequence
circular
tentacles
of
cigar
smoke
were
twisting
already
upon
the
heavy
air
paging
lieutenant
tannenbaum
again
it
was
the
changeling
maury
bring
us
the
flute
anthony
and
maury
rushed
into
the
kitchen
richard
caramel
started
the
phonograph
and
approached
gloria
dance
with
your
cousin
i
do
want
to
dance
then
i
going
to
carry
you
around
as
though
he
were
doing
something
of
overpowering
importance
he
picked
her
up
in
his
fat
little
arms
and
started
trotting
gravely
about
the
room
set
me
down
dick
i
dizzy
she
insisted
he
dumped
her
in
a
bouncing
bundle
on
the
couch
and
rushed
off
to
the
kitchen
shouting
tana
tana
then
without
warning
she
felt
other
arms
around
her
felt
herself
lifted
from
the
lounge
joe
hull
had
picked
her
up
and
was
trying
drunkenly
to
imitate
dick
put
me
down
she
said
sharply
his
maudlin
laugh
and
the
sight
of
that
prickly
yellow
jaw
close
to
her
face
stirred
her
to
intolerable
disgust
at
once
the
he
began
but
got
no
further
for
gloria
hand
swung
around
swiftly
and
caught
him
in
the
cheek
at
this
he
all
at
once
let
go
of
her
and
she
fell
to
the
floor
her
shoulder
hitting
the
table
a
glancing
blow
in
transit
then
the
room
seemed
full
of
men
and
smoke
there
was
tana
in
his
white
coat
reeling
about
supported
by
maury
into
his
flute
he
was
blowing
a
weird
blend
of
sound
that
was
known
cried
anthony
as
the
japanese
joe
hull
had
found
a
box
of
candles
and
was
juggling
them
yelling
one
down
every
time
he
missed
and
dick
was
dancing
by
himself
in
a
fascinated
whirl
around
and
about
the
room
it
appeared
to
her
that
everything
in
the
room
was
staggering
in
grotesque
gyrations
through
intersecting
planes
of
hazy
blue
outside
the
storm
had
come
up
amazingly
the
lulls
within
were
filled
with
the
scrape
of
the
tall
bushes
against
the
house
and
the
roaring
of
the
rain
on
the
tin
roof
of
the
kitchen
the
lightning
was
interminable
letting
down
thick
drips
of
thunder
like
pig
iron
from
the
heart
of
a
furnace
gloria
could
see
that
the
rain
was
spitting
in
at
three
of
the
windows
but
she
could
not
move
to
shut
them
she
was
in
the
hall
she
had
said
good
night
but
no
one
had
heard
or
heeded
her
it
seemed
for
an
instant
as
though
something
had
looked
down
over
the
head
of
the
banister
but
she
could
not
have
gone
back
into
the
living
room
better
madness
than
the
madness
of
that
clamor
she
fumbled
for
the
electric
switch
and
missed
it
in
the
darkness
a
roomful
of
lightning
showed
her
the
button
plainly
on
the
wall
but
when
the
impenetrable
black
shut
down
it
again
eluded
her
fumbling
fingers
so
she
slipped
off
her
dress
and
petticoat
and
threw
herself
weakly
on
the
dry
side
of
the
bed
she
shut
her
eyes
from
arose
the
babel
of
the
drinkers
punctured
suddenly
by
a
tinkling
shiver
of
broken
glass
and
then
another
and
by
a
soaring
fragment
of
unsteady
irregular
song
she
lay
there
for
something
over
two
hours
so
she
calculated
afterward
sheerly
by
piecing
together
the
bits
of
time
she
was
conscious
even
aware
after
a
long
while
that
the
noise
had
lessened
and
that
the
storm
was
moving
off
westward
throwing
back
lingering
showers
of
sound
that
fell
heavy
and
lifeless
as
her
soul
into
the
soggy
fields
this
was
succeeded
by
a
slow
reluctant
scattering
of
the
rain
and
wind
until
there
was
nothing
outside
her
windows
but
a
gentle
dripping
and
the
swishing
play
of
a
cluster
of
wet
vine
against
the
sill
she
was
in
a
state
between
sleeping
and
waking
with
neither
condition
predominant
and
she
was
harassed
by
a
desire
to
rid
herself
of
a
weight
pressing
down
upon
her
breast
she
felt
that
if
she
could
cry
the
weight
would
be
lifted
and
forcing
the
lids
of
her
eyes
together
she
tried
to
raise
a
lump
in
her
throat
to
no
avail
drip
drip
drip
the
sound
was
not
unpleasant
like
spring
like
a
cool
rain
of
her
childhood
that
made
cheerful
mud
in
her
back
yard
and
watered
the
tiny
garden
she
had
dug
with
miniature
rake
and
spade
and
hoe
drip
it
was
like
days
when
the
rain
came
out
of
yellow
skies
that
melted
just
before
twilight
and
shot
one
radiant
shaft
of
sunlight
diagonally
down
the
heavens
into
the
damp
green
trees
so
cool
so
clear
and
clean
and
her
mother
there
at
the
centre
of
the
world
at
the
centre
of
the
rain
safe
and
dry
and
strong
she
wanted
her
mother
now
and
her
mother
was
dead
beyond
sight
and
touch
forever
and
this
weight
was
pressing
on
her
pressing
on
her
oh
it
pressed
on
her
so
she
became
rigid
some
one
had
come
to
the
door
and
was
standing
regarding
her
very
quiet
except
for
a
slight
swaying
motion
she
could
see
the
outline
of
his
figure
distinct
against
some
indistinguishable
light
there
was
no
sound
anywhere
only
a
great
persuasive
silence
even
the
dripping
had
ceased
only
this
figure
swaying
swaying
in
the
doorway
an
indiscernible
and
subtly
menacing
terror
a
personality
filthy
under
its
varnish
like
smallpox
spots
under
a
layer
of
powder
yet
her
tired
heart
beating
until
it
shook
her
breasts
made
her
sure
that
there
was
still
life
in
her
desperately
shaken
threatened
the
minute
or
succession
of
minutes
prolonged
itself
interminably
and
a
swimming
blur
began
to
form
before
her
eyes
which
tried
with
childish
persistence
to
pierce
the
gloom
in
the
direction
of
the
door
in
another
instant
it
seemed
that
some
unimaginable
force
would
shatter
her
out
of
existence
and
then
the
figure
in
the
doorway
it
was
hull
she
saw
hull
turned
deliberately
and
still
slightly
swaying
moved
back
and
off
as
if
absorbed
into
that
incomprehensible
light
that
had
given
him
dimension
blood
rushed
back
into
her
limbs
blood
and
life
together
with
a
start
of
energy
she
sat
upright
shifting
her
body
until
her
feet
touched
the
floor
over
the
side
of
the
bed
she
knew
what
she
must
do
now
now
before
it
was
too
late
she
must
go
out
into
this
cool
damp
out
away
to
feel
the
wet
swish
of
the
grass
around
her
feet
and
the
fresh
moisture
on
her
forehead
mechanically
she
struggled
into
her
clothes
groping
in
the
dark
of
the
closet
for
a
hat
she
must
go
from
this
house
where
the
thing
hovered
that
pressed
upon
her
bosom
or
else
made
itself
into
stray
swaying
figures
in
the
gloom
in
a
panic
she
fumbled
clumsily
at
her
coat
found
the
sleeve
just
as
she
heard
anthony
footsteps
on
the
lower
stair
she
dared
not
wait
he
might
not
let
her
go
and
even
anthony
was
part
of
this
weight
part
of
this
evil
house
and
the
sombre
darkness
that
was
growing
up
about
it
through
the
hall
then
and
down
the
back
stairs
hearing
voice
in
the
bedroom
she
had
just
left
gloria
gloria
but
she
had
reached
the
kitchen
now
passed
out
through
the
doorway
into
the
night
a
hundred
drops
startled
by
a
flare
of
wind
from
a
dripping
tree
scattered
on
her
and
she
pressed
them
gladly
to
her
face
with
hot
hands
gloria
gloria
the
voice
was
infinitely
remote
muffed
and
made
plaintive
by
the
walls
she
had
just
left
she
rounded
the
house
and
started
down
the
front
path
toward
the
road
almost
exultant
as
she
turned
into
it
and
followed
the
carpet
of
short
grass
alongside
moving
with
caution
in
the
intense
darkness
gloria
she
broke
into
a
run
stumbled
over
the
segment
of
a
branch
twisted
off
by
the
wind
the
voice
was
outside
the
house
now
anthony
finding
the
bedroom
deserted
had
come
onto
the
porch
but
this
thing
was
driving
her
forward
it
was
back
there
with
anthony
and
she
must
go
on
in
her
flight
under
this
dim
and
oppressive
heaven
forcing
herself
through
the
silence
ahead
as
though
it
were
a
tangible
barrier
before
her
she
had
gone
some
distance
along
the
barely
discernible
road
probably
half
a
mile
passed
a
single
deserted
barn
that
loomed
up
black
and
foreboding
the
only
building
of
any
sort
between
the
gray
house
and
marietta
then
she
turned
the
fork
where
the
road
entered
the
wood
and
ran
between
two
high
walls
of
leaves
and
branches
that
nearly
touched
overhead
she
noticed
suddenly
a
thin
longitudinal
gleam
of
silver
upon
the
road
before
her
like
a
bright
sword
half
embedded
in
the
mud
as
she
came
closer
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
satisfaction
it
was
a
full
of
water
and
glancing
heavenward
she
saw
a
light
rift
of
sky
and
knew
that
the
moon
was
out
gloria
she
started
violently
anthony
was
not
two
hundred
feet
behind
her
gloria
wait
for
me
she
shut
her
lips
tightly
to
keep
from
screaming
and
increased
her
gait
before
she
had
gone
another
hundred
yards
the
woods
disappeared
rolling
back
like
a
dark
stocking
from
the
leg
of
the
road
three
minutes
walk
ahead
of
her
suspended
in
the
now
high
and
limitless
air
she
saw
a
thin
interlacing
of
attenuated
gleams
and
glitters
centred
in
a
regular
undulation
on
some
one
invisible
point
abruptly
she
knew
where
she
would
go
that
was
the
great
cascade
of
wires
that
rose
high
over
the
river
like
the
legs
of
a
gigantic
spider
whose
eye
was
the
little
green
light
in
the
and
ran
with
the
railroad
bridge
in
the
direction
of
the
station
the
station
there
would
be
the
train
to
take
her
away
gloria
it
me
it
anthony
gloria
i
wo
try
to
stop
you
for
god
sake
where
are
you
she
made
no
answer
but
began
to
run
keeping
on
the
high
side
of
the
road
and
leaping
the
gleaming
puddles
dimensionless
pools
of
thin
unsubstantial
gold
turning
sharply
to
the
left
she
followed
a
narrow
wagon
road
serving
to
avoid
a
dark
body
on
the
ground
she
looked
up
as
an
owl
hooted
mournfully
from
a
solitary
tree
just
ahead
of
her
she
could
see
the
trestle
that
led
to
the
railroad
bridge
and
the
steps
mounting
up
to
it
the
station
lay
across
the
river
another
sounds
startled
her
the
melancholy
siren
of
an
approaching
train
and
almost
simultaneously
a
repeated
call
thin
now
and
far
away
gloria
gloria
anthony
must
have
followed
the
main
road
she
laughed
with
a
sort
of
malicious
cunning
at
having
eluded
him
she
could
spare
the
time
to
wait
until
the
train
went
by
the
siren
soared
again
closer
at
hand
and
then
with
no
anticipatory
roar
and
clamor
a
dark
and
sinuous
body
curved
into
view
against
the
shadows
far
down
the
track
and
with
no
sound
but
the
rush
of
the
cleft
wind
and
the
clocklike
tick
of
the
rails
moved
toward
the
bridge
it
was
an
electric
train
above
the
engine
two
vivid
blurs
of
blue
light
formed
incessantly
a
radiant
crackling
bar
between
them
which
like
a
spluttering
flame
in
a
lamp
beside
a
corpse
lit
for
an
instant
the
successive
rows
of
trees
and
caused
gloria
to
draw
back
instinctively
to
the
far
side
of
the
road
the
light
was
tepid
the
temperature
of
warm
blood
the
clicking
blended
suddenly
with
itself
in
a
rush
of
even
sound
and
then
elongating
in
sombre
elasticity
the
thing
roared
blindly
by
her
and
thundered
onto
the
bridge
racing
the
lurid
shaft
of
fire
it
cast
into
the
solemn
river
alongside
then
it
contracted
swiftly
sucking
in
its
sound
until
it
left
only
a
reverberant
echo
which
died
upon
the
farther
bank
silence
crept
down
again
over
the
wet
country
the
faint
dripping
resumed
and
suddenly
a
great
shower
of
drops
tumbled
upon
gloria
stirring
her
out
of
the
torpor
which
the
passage
of
the
train
had
wrought
she
ran
swiftly
down
a
descending
level
to
the
bank
and
began
climbing
the
iron
stairway
to
the
bridge
remembering
that
it
was
something
she
had
always
wanted
to
do
and
that
she
would
have
the
added
excitement
of
traversing
the
plank
that
ran
beside
the
tracks
over
the
river
there
this
was
better
she
was
at
the
top
now
and
could
see
the
lands
about
her
as
successive
sweeps
of
open
country
cold
under
the
moon
coarsely
patched
and
seamed
with
thin
rows
and
heavy
clumps
of
trees
to
her
right
half
a
mile
down
the
river
which
trailed
away
behind
the
light
like
the
shiny
slimy
path
of
a
snail
winked
the
scattered
lights
of
marietta
not
two
hundred
yards
away
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
squatted
the
station
marked
by
a
sullen
lantern
the
oppression
was
lifted
now
the
below
her
were
rocking
the
young
starlight
to
a
haunted
doze
she
stretched
out
her
arms
with
a
gesture
of
freedom
this
was
what
she
had
wanted
to
stand
alone
where
it
was
high
and
cool
gloria
like
a
startled
child
she
scurried
along
the
plank
hopping
skipping
jumping
with
an
ecstatic
sense
of
her
own
physical
lightness
let
him
come
now
she
no
longer
feared
that
only
she
must
first
reach
the
station
because
that
was
part
of
the
game
she
was
happy
her
hat
snatched
off
was
clutched
tightly
in
her
hand
and
her
short
curled
hair
bobbed
up
and
down
about
her
ears
she
had
thought
she
would
never
feel
so
young
again
but
this
was
her
night
her
world
triumphantly
she
laughed
as
she
left
the
plank
and
reaching
the
wooden
platform
flung
herself
down
happily
beside
an
iron
here
i
am
she
called
gay
as
the
dawn
in
her
elation
here
i
am
anthony
dear
old

anthony
gloria

reached
the
platform
ran
toward
her

knelt
and
took
her
in
his
arms
yes
what
was
the
matter
why
did
you
leave
he
queried
anxiously
i
had
to
there
was
something
she
paused
and
a
flicker
of
uneasiness
lashed
at
her
mind
there
was
something
sitting
on
me
here
she
put
her
hand
on
her
breast
i
had
to
go
out
and
get
away
from
it
what
do
you
mean

i
do

that
man

came
to
my
door
drunk

sort
of
crazy
by
that
time
gloria
dearest
wearily
she
laid
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
let
go
back
he
suggested
she
shivered
uh
no
i
could
it
come
and
sit
on
me
again
her
voice
rose
to
a
cry
that
hung
plaintive
on
the
darkness
that
thing
there
there
he
soothed
her
pulling
her
close
to
him
we
wo
do
anything
you
do
want
to
do
what
do
you
want
to
do
just
sit
here
i
want
i
want
to
go
away
where
oh
anywhere
by
golly
gloria
he
cried
you
still
tight
no
i
not
i
have
been
all
evening
i
went
about
oh
i
do
know
about
half
an
hour
after
dinner
ouch
he
had
inadvertently
touched
her
right
shoulder
it
hurts
me
i
hurt
it
some
way
i
do
know
somebody
picked
me
up
and
dropped
me
gloria
come
home
it
late
and
damp
i
ca
she
wailed
oh
anthony
do
ask
me
to
i
will

go
home
and
i
wait
here
for
a
train

go
to

hotel

do
want

me
i
want
to

want
to
sleep
oh

want
to

and
then
when
you
got
all
the
smell
of
whiskey
and
cigarettes
out
of
the
house
and
everything
straight
and
hull
is
gone
then
i
come
home
if
i
went
now
that
thing
oh
she
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hand
anthony
saw
the
futility
of
trying
to
persuade
her
i
was
all
sober
when
you
left
he
said
dick
was
asleep
on
the
lounge
and
maury
and
i
were
having
a
discussion
that
fellow
hull
had
wandered
off
somewhere
then
i
began
to
realize
i
had
seen
you
for
several
hours
so
i
went
he
broke
off
as
a
salutatory
hello
there
boomed
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
gloria
sprang
to
her
feet
and
he
did
likewise
it
maury
voice
she
cried
excitedly
if
it
hull
with
him
keep
them
away
keep
them
away
who
there
anthony
called
just
dick
and
maury
returned
two
voices
reassuringly
where
hull
he
in
bed
passed
out
their
figures
appeared
dimly
on
the
platform
what
the
devil
are
you
and
gloria
doing
here
inquired
richard
caramel
with
sleepy
bewilderment
what
are
two
doing
here
maury
laughed
damned
if
i
know
we
followed
you
and
had
the
deuce
of
a
time
doing
it
i
heard
you
out
on
the
porch
yelling
for
gloria
so
i
woke
up
the
caramel
here
and
got
it
through
his
head
with
some
difficulty
that
if
there
was
a
we
better
be
on
it
he
slowed
me
up
by
sitting
down
in
the
road
at
intervals
and
asking
me
what
it
was
all
about
we
tracked
you
by
the
pleasant
scent
of
canadian
club
there
was
a
rattle
of
nervous
laughter
under
the
low
how
did
you
track
us
really
well
we
followed
along
down
the
road
and
then
we
suddenly
lost
you
seems
you
turned
off
at
a
wagontrail
after
a
while
somebody
hailed
us
and
asked
us
if
we
were
looking
for
a
young
girl
well
we
came
up
and
found
it
was
a
little
shivering
old
man
sitting
on
a
fallen
tree
like
somebody
in
a
fairy
tale
turned
down
here
he
said
most
steppud
on
me
goin
somewhere
in
an
awful
hustle
and
then
a
fella
in
short
golfin
pants
come
runnin
along
and
went
after
her
he
throwed
me
this
the
old
fellow
had
a
dollar
bill
he
was
waving
around
oh
the
poor
old
man
ejaculated
gloria
moved
i
threw
him
another
and
we
went
on
though
he
asked
us
to
stay
and
tell
him
what
it
was
all
about
poor
old
man
repeated
gloria
dismally
dick
sat
down
sleepily
on
a
box
and
now
what
he
inquired
in
the
tone
of
stoic
resignation
gloria
upset
explained
anthony
she
and
i
are
going
to
the
city
by
the
next
train
maury
in
the
darkness
had
pulled
a
from
his
pocket
strike
a
match
a
tiny
flare
leaped
out
of
the
opaque
background
illuminating
the
four
faces
grotesque
and
unfamiliar
here
in
the
open
night
let
see
two
no
that
evening
by
gad
you
wo
get
a
train
till
anthony
hesitated
well
he
muttered
uncertainly
we
decided
to
stay
here
and
wait
for
it
you
two
might
as
well
go
back
and
sleep
you
go
too
anthony
urged
gloria
i
want
you
to
have
some
sleep
dear
you
been
as
pale
as
a
ghost
all
day
why
you
little
idiot
dick
yawned
very
well
you
stay
we
stay
he
walked
out
from
under
the
shed
and
surveyed
the
heavens
rather
a
nice
night
after
all
stars
are
out
and
everything
exceptionally
tasty
assortment
of
them
let
see
gloria
moved
after
him
and
the
other
two
followed
her
let
sit
out
here
she
suggested
i
like
it
much
better
anthony
and
dick
converted
a
long
box
into
a
backrest
and
found
a
board
dry
enough
for
gloria
to
sit
on
anthony
dropped
down
beside
her
and
with
some
effort
dick
hoisted
himself
onto
an
near
them
tana
went
to
sleep
in
the
porch
hammock
he
remarked
we
carried
him
in
and
left
him
next
to
the
kitchen
stove
to
dry
he
was
drenched
to
the
skin
that
awful
little
man
sighed
gloria
how
do
you
do
the
voice
sonorous
and
funereal
had
come
from
above
and
they
looked
up
startled
to
find
that
in
some
manner
maury
had
climbed
to
the
roof
of
the
shed
where
he
sat
dangling
his
feet
over
the
edge
outlined
as
a
shadowy
and
fantastic
gargoyle
against
the
now
brilliant
sky
it
must
be
for
such
occasions
as
this
he
began
softly
his
words
having
the
effect
of
floating
down
from
an
immense
height
and
settling
softly
upon
his
auditors
that
the
righteous
of
the
land
decorate
the
railroads
with
asserting
in
red
and
yellow
that
christ
is
god
placing
them
appropriately
enough
next
to
announcements
that
whiskey
is
good
there
was
gentle
laughter
and
the
three
below
kept
their
heads
tilted
upward
i
think
i
shall
tell
you
the
story
of
my
education
continued
maury
under
these
sardonic
constellations
do
please
shall
i
really
they
waited
expectantly
while
he
directed
a
ruminative
yawn
toward
the
white
smiling
moon
well
he
began
as
an
infant
i
prayed
i
stored
up
prayers
against
future
wickedness
one
year
i
stored
up
nineteen
hundred
i
lay
me
throw
down
a
cigarette
murmured
some
one
a
small
package
reached
the
platform
simultaneously
with
the
stentorian
command
silence
i
am
about
to
unburden
myself
of
many
memorable
remarks
reserved
for
the
darkness
of
such
earths
and
the
brilliance
of
such
skies
below
a
lighted
match
was
passed
from
cigarette
to
cigarette
the
voice
resumed
i
was
adept
at
fooling
the
deity
i
prayed
immediately
after
all
crimes
until
eventually
prayer
and
crime
became
indistinguishable
to
me
i
believed
that
because
a
man
cried
out
god
when
a
safe
fell
on
him
it
proved
that
belief
was
rooted
deep
in
the
human
breast
then
i
went
to
school
for
fourteen
years
half
a
hundred
earnest
men
pointed
to
ancient
and
cried
to
me
the
real
thing
these
new
rifles
are
only
shallow
superficial
imitations
they
damned
the
books
i
read
and
the
things
i
thought
by
calling
them
immoral
later
the
fashion
changed
and
they
damned
things
by
calling
them
and
so
i
turned
canny
for
my
years
from
the
professors
to
the
poets
listening
to
the
lyric
tenor
of
swinburne
and
the
tenor
robusto
of
shelley
to
shakespeare
with
his
first
bass
and
his
fine
range
to
tennyson
with
his
second
bass
and
his
occasional
falsetto
to
milton
and
marlow
bassos
profundo
i
gave
ear
to
browning
chatting
byron
declaiming
and
wordsworth
droning
this
at
least
did
me
no
harm
i
learned
a
little
of
beauty
enough
to
know
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
truth
and
i
found
moreover
that
there
was
no
great
literary
tradition
there
was
only
the
tradition
of
the
eventful
death
of
every
literary
tradition
then
i
grew
up
and
the
beauty
of
succulent
illusions
fell
away
from
me
the
fibre
of
my
mind
coarsened
and
my
eyes
grew
miserably
keen
life
rose
around
my
island
like
a
sea
and
presently
i
was
swimming
the
transition
was
subtle
the
thing
had
lain
in
wait
for
me
for
some
time
it
has
its
insidious
seemingly
innocuous
trap
for
every
one
with
me
no
i
did
try
to
seduce
the
janitor
wife
nor
did
i
run
through
the
streets
unclothed
proclaiming
my
virility
it
is
never
quite
passion
that
does
the
business
it
is
the
dress
that
passion
wears
i
became
bored
that
was
all
boredom
which
is
another
name
and
a
frequent
disguise
for
vitality
became
the
unconscious
motive
of
all
my
acts
beauty
was
behind
me
do
you
understand
i
was
grown
he
paused
end
of
school
and
college
period
opening
of
part
two
three
quietly
active
points
of
light
showed
the
location
of
his
listeners
gloria
was
now
half
sitting
half
lying
in
anthony
lap
his
arm
was
around
her
so
tightly
that
she
could
hear
the
beating
of
his
heart
richard
caramel
perched
on
the
from
time
to
time
stirred
and
gave
off
a
faint
grunt
i
grew
up
then
into
this
land
of
jazz
and
fell
immediately
into
a
state
of
almost
audible
confusion
life
stood
over
me
like
an
immoral
schoolmistress
editing
my
ordered
thoughts
but
with
a
mistaken
faith
in
intelligence
i
plodded
on
i
read
smith
who
laughed
at
charity
and
insisted
that
the
sneer
was
the
highest
form
of
but
smith
himself
replaced
charity
as
an
obscurer
of
the
light
i
read
jones
who
neatly
disposed
of
individualism
and
behold
jones
was
still
in
my
way
i
did
not
think
i
was
a
for
the
thoughts
of
many
men
rather
was
i
one
of
those
desirable
but
impotent
countries
over
which
the
great
powers
surge
back
and
forth
i
reached
maturity
under
the
impression
that
i
was
gathering
the
experience
to
order
my
life
for
happiness
indeed
i
accomplished
the
not
unusual
feat
of
solving
each
question
in
my
mind
long
before
it
presented
itself
to
me
in
life
and
of
being
beaten
and
bewildered
just
the
same
but
after
a
few
tastes
of
this
latter
dish
i
had
had
enough
here
i
said
experience
is
not
worth
the
getting
it
not
a
thing
that
happens
pleasantly
to
a
passive
you
it
a
wall
that
an
active
you
runs
up
against
so
i
wrapped
myself
in
what
i
thought
was
my
invulnerable
scepticism
and
decided
that
my
education
was
complete
but
it
was
too
late
protect
myself
as
i
might
by
making
no
new
ties
with
tragic
and
predestined
humanity
i
was
lost
with
the
rest
i
had
traded
the
fight
against
love
for
the
fight
against
loneliness
the
fight
against
life
for
the
fight
against
death
he
broke
off
to
give
emphasis
to
his
last
observation
after
a
moment
he
yawned
and
resumed
i
suppose
that
the
beginning
of
the
second
phase
of
my
education
was
a
ghastly
dissatisfaction
at
being
used
in
spite
of
myself
for
some
inscrutable
purpose
of
whose
ultimate
goal
i
was
unaware
if
indeed
there
an
ultimate
goal
it
was
a
difficult
choice
the
schoolmistress
seemed
to
be
saying
going
to
play
football
and
nothing
but
football
if
you
do
want
to
play
football
you
play
at
all
what
was
i
to
do
the
playtime
was
so
short
you
see
i
felt
that
we
were
even
denied
what
consolation
there
might
have
been
in
being
a
figment
of
a
corporate
man
rising
from
his
knees
do
you
think
that
i
leaped
at
this
pessimism
grasped
it
as
a
sweetly
smug
superior
thing
no
more
depressing
really
than
say
a
gray
autumn
day
before
a
fire
i
do
think
i
did
that
i
was
a
great
deal
too
warm
for
that
and
too
alive
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
no
ultimate
goal
for
man
man
was
beginning
a
grotesque
and
bewildered
fight
with
nature
nature
that
by
the
divine
and
magnificent
accident
had
brought
us
to
where
we
could
fly
in
her
face
she
had
invented
ways
to
rid
the
race
of
the
inferior
and
thus
give
the
remainder
strength
to
fill
her
higher
or
let
us
say
her
more
amusing
though
still
unconscious
and
accidental
intentions
and
actuated
by
the
highest
gifts
of
the
enlightenment
we
were
seeking
to
circumvent
her
in
this
republic
i
saw
the
black
beginning
to
mingle
with
the
white
in
europe
there
was
taking
place
an
economic
catastrophe
to
save
three
or
four
diseased
and
wretchedly
governed
races
from
the
one
mastery
that
might
organize
them
for
material
prosperity
we
produce
a
christ
who
can
raise
up
the
leper
and
presently
the
breed
of
the
leper
is
the
salt
of
the
earth
if
any
one
can
find
any
lesson
in
that
let
him
stand
forth
there
only
one
lesson
to
be
learned
from
life
anyway
interrupted
gloria
not
in
contradiction
but
in
a
sort
of
melancholy
agreement
what
that
demanded
maury
sharply
that
there
no
lesson
to
be
learned
from
life
after
a
short
silence
maury
said
young
gloria
the
beautiful
and
merciless
lady
first
looked
at
the
world
with
the
fundamental
sophistication
i
have
struggled
to
attain
that
anthony
never
will
attain
that
dick
will
never
fully
understand
there
was
a
disgusted
groan
from
the
anthony
grown
accustomed
to
the
dark
could
see
plainly
the
flash
of
richard
yellow
eye
and
the
look
of
resentment
on
his
face
as
he
cried
you
crazy
by
your
own
statement
i
should
have
attained
some
experience
by
trying
trying
what
cried
maury
fiercely
trying
to
pierce
the
darkness
of
political
idealism
with
some
wild
despairing
urge
toward
truth
sitting
day
after
day
supine
in
a
rigid
chair
and
infinitely
removed
from
life
staring
at
the
tip
of
a
steeple
through
the
trees
trying
to
separate
definitely
and
for
all
time
the
knowable
from
the
unknowable
trying
to
take
a
piece
of
actuality
and
give
it
glamour
from
your
own
soul
to
make
for
that
inexpressible
quality
it
possessed
in
life
and
lost
in
transit
to
paper
or
canvas
struggling
in
a
laboratory
through
weary
years
for
one
iota
of
relative
truth
in
a
mass
of
wheels
or
a
test
tube
have
you
maury
paused
and
in
his
answer
when
it
came
there
was
a
measure
of
weariness
a
bitter
overnote
that
lingered
for
a
moment
in
those
three
minds
before
it
floated
up
and
off
like
a
bubble
bound
for
the
moon
not
i
he
said
softly
i
was
born
tired
but
with
the
quality
of
mother
wit
the
gift
of
women
like
gloria
to
that
for
all
my
talking
and
listening
my
waiting
in
vain
for
the
eternal
generality
that
seems
to
lie
just
beyond
every
argument
and
every
speculation
to
that
i
have
added
not
one
jot
in
the
distance
a
deep
sound
that
had
been
audible
for
some
moments
identified
itself
by
a
plaintive
mooing
like
that
of
a
gigantic
cow
and
by
the
pearly
spot
of
a
headlight
apparent
half
a
mile
away
it
was
a
train
this
time
rumbling
and
groaning
and
as
it
tumbled
by
with
a
monstrous
complaint
it
sent
a
shower
of
sparks
and
cinders
over
the
platform
not
one
jot
again
maury
voice
dropped
down
to
them
as
from
a
great
height
what
a
feeble
thing
intelligence
is
with
its
short
steps
its
waverings
its
pacings
back
and
forth
its
disastrous
retreats
intelligence
is
a
mere
instrument
of
circumstances
there
are
people
who
say
that
intelligence
must
have
built
the
universe
why
intelligence
never
built
a
steam
engine
circumstances
built
a
steam
engine
intelligence
is
little
more
than
a
short
by
which
we
measure
the
infinite
achievements
of
circumstances
i
could
quote
you
the
philosophy
of
the
hour
but
for
all
we
know
fifty
years
may
see
a
complete
reversal
of
this
abnegation
absorbing
the
intellectuals
the
triumph
of
christ
over
anatole
france
he
hesitated
and
then
added
but
all
i
know
the
tremendous
importance
of
myself
to
me
and
the
necessity
of
acknowledging
that
importance
to
myself
these
things
the
wise
and
lovely
gloria
was
born
knowing
these
things
and
the
painful
futility
of
trying
to
know
anything
else
well
i
started
to
tell
you
of
my
education
did
i
but
i
learned
nothing
you
see
very
little
even
about
myself
and
if
i
had
i
should
die
with
my
lips
shut
and
the
guard
on
my
fountain
pen
as
the
wisest
men
have
done
since
oh
since
the
failure
of
a
certain
matter
a
strange
matter
by
the
way
it
concerned
some
sceptics
who
thought
they
were
just
as
you
and
i
let
me
tell
you
about
them
by
way
of
an
evening
prayer
before
you
all
drop
off
to
sleep
once
upon
a
time
all
the
men
of
mind
and
genius
in
the
world
became
of
one
belief
that
is
to
say
of
no
belief
but
it
wearied
them
to
think
that
within
a
few
years
after
their
death
many
cults
and
systems
and
prognostications
would
be
ascribed
to
them
which
they
had
never
meditated
nor
intended
so
they
said
to
one
another
join
together
and
make
a
great
book
that
will
last
forever
to
mock
the
credulity
of
man
let
persuade
our
more
erotic
poets
to
write
about
the
delights
of
the
flesh
and
induce
some
of
our
robust
journalists
to
contribute
stories
of
famous
amours
we
include
all
the
most
preposterous
old
wives
tales
now
current
we
choose
the
keenest
satirist
alive
to
compile
a
deity
from
all
the
deities
worshipped
by
mankind
a
deity
who
will
be
more
magnificent
than
any
of
them
and
yet
so
weakly
human
that
he
become
a
byword
for
laughter
the
world
over
and
we
ascribe
to
him
all
sorts
of
jokes
and
vanities
and
rages
in
which
he
be
supposed
to
indulge
for
his
own
diversion
so
that
the
people
will
read
our
book
and
ponder
it
and
there
be
no
more
nonsense
in
the
world
let
us
take
care
that
the
book
possesses
all
the
virtues
of
style
so
that
it
may
last
forever
as
a
witness
to
our
profound
scepticism
and
our
universal
irony
so
the
men
did
and
they
died
but
the
book
lived
always
so
beautifully
had
it
been
written
and
so
astounding
the
quality
of
imagination
with
which
these
men
of
mind
and
genius
had
endowed
it
they
had
neglected
to
give
it
a
name
but
after
they
were
dead
it
became
known
as
the
bible
when
he
concluded
there
was
no
comment
some
damp
languor
sleeping
on
the
air
of
night
seemed
to
have
bewitched
them
all
as
i
said
i
started
on
the
story
of
my
education
but
my
are
dead
and
the
night
almost
over
and
soon
there
be
an
awful
jabbering
going
on
everywhere
in
the
trees
and
the
houses
and
the
two
little
stores
over
there
behind
the
station
and
there
be
a
great
running
up
and
down
upon
the
earth
for
a
few
hours
well
he
concluded
with
a
laugh
thank
god
we
four
can
all
pass
to
our
eternal
rest
knowing
we
left
the
world
a
little
better
for
having
lived
in
it
a
breeze
sprang
up
blowing
with
it
faint
wisps
of
life
which
flattened
against
the
sky
your
remarks
grow
rambling
and
inconclusive
said
anthony
sleepily
you
expected
one
of
those
miracles
of
illumination
by
which
you
say
your
most
brilliant
and
pregnant
things
in
exactly
the
setting
that
should
provoke
the
ideal
symposium
meanwhile
gloria
has
shown
her
detachment
by
falling
asleep
i
can
tell
that
by
the
fact
that
she
has
managed
to
concentrate
her
entire
weight
upon
my
broken
body
have
i
bored
you
inquired
maury
looking
down
with
some
concern
no
you
have
disappointed
us
you
shot
a
lot
of
arrows
but
did
you
shoot
any
birds
i
leave
the
birds
to
dick
said
maury
hurriedly
i
speak
erratically
in
disassociated
fragments
you
can
get
no
rise
from
me
muttered
dick
my
mind
is
full
of
any
number
of
material
things
i
want
a
warm
bath
too
much
to
worry
about
the
importance
of
my
work
or
what
proportion
of
us
are
pathetic
figures
dawn
made
itself
felt
in
a
gathering
whiteness
eastward
over
the
river
and
an
intermittent
cheeping
in
the
trees
quarter
to
five
sighed
dick
almost
another
hour
to
wait
look
two
gone
he
was
pointing
to
anthony
whose
lids
had
sagged
over
his
eyes
sleep
of
the
patch
family
but
in
another
five
minutes
despite
the
amplifying
cheeps
and
chirrups
his
own
head
had
fallen
forward
nodded
down
twice
thrice
only
maury
noble
remained
awake
seated
upon
the
station
roof
his
eyes
wide
open
and
fixed
with
fatigued
intensity
upon
the
distant
nucleus
of
morning
he
was
wondering
at
the
unreality
of
ideas
at
the
fading
radiance
of
existence
and
at
the
little
absorptions
that
were
creeping
avidly
into
his
life
like
rats
into
a
ruined
house
he
was
sorry
for
no
one
now
on
monday
morning
there
would
be
his
business
and
later
there
would
be
a
girl
of
another
class
whose
whole
life
he
was
these
were
the
things
nearest
his
heart
in
the
strangeness
of
the
brightening
day
it
seemed
presumptuous
that
with
this
feeble
broken
instrument
of
his
mind
he
had
ever
tried
to
think
there
was
the
sun
letting
down
great
glowing
masses
of
heat
there
was
life
active
and
snarling
moving
about
them
like
a
fly
swarm
the
dark
pants
of
smoke
from
the
engine
a
crisp
all
aboard
and
a
bell
ringing
confusedly
maury
saw
eyes
in
the
milk
train
staring
curiously
up
at
him
heard
gloria
and
anthony
in
quick
controversy
as
to
whether
he
should
go
to
the
city
with
her
then
another
clamor
and
she
was
gone
and
the
three
men
pale
as
ghosts
were
standing
alone
upon
the
platform
while
a
grimy
went
down
the
road
on
top
of
a
motor
truck
carolling
hoarsely
at
the
summer
morning
chapter
iii
the
broken
lute
is
of
an
august
evening
the
windows
in
the
living
room
of
the
gray
house
are
wide
open
patiently
exchanging
the
tainted
inner
atmosphere
of
liquor
and
smoke
for
the
fresh
drowsiness
of
the
late
hot
dusk
there
are
dying
flower
scents
upon
the
air
so
thin
so
fragile
as
to
hint
already
of
a
summer
laid
away
in
time
but
august
is
still
proclaimed
relentlessly
by
a
thousand
crickets
around
the
and
by
one
who
has
broken
into
the
house
and
concealed
himself
confidently
behind
a
bookcase
from
time
to
time
shrieking
of
his
cleverness
and
his
indomitable
room
itself
is
in
messy
disorder
on
the
table
is
a
dish
of
fruit
which
is
real
but
appears
artificial
around
it
are
grouped
an
ominous
assortment
of
decanters
glasses
and
heaped
the
latter
still
raising
wavy
into
the
stale
air
the
effect
on
the
whole
needing
but
a
skull
to
resemble
that
venerable
chromo
once
a
fixture
in
every
den
which
presents
the
appendages
to
the
life
of
pleasure
with
delightful
and
a
while
the
sprightly
solo
of
the
supercricket
is
interrupted
rather
than
joined
by
a
new
sound
the
melancholy
wail
of
an
erratically
fingered
flute
it
is
obvious
that
the
musician
is
practising
rather
than
performing
for
from
time
to
time
the
gnarled
strain
breaks
off
and
after
an
interval
of
indistinct
mutterings
prior
to
the
seventh
false
start
a
third
sound
contributes
to
the
subdued
discord
it
is
a
taxi
outside
a
minute
silence
then
the
taxi
again
its
boisterous
retreat
almost
obliterating
the
scrape
of
footsteps
on
the
cinder
walk
the
shrieks
alarmingly
through
the
the
kitchen
enters
a
small
fatigued
japanese
hastily
buttoning
a
servant
coat
of
white
duck
he
opens
the
front
and
admits
a
handsome
young
man
of
thirty
clad
in
the
sort
of
clothes
peculiar
to
those
who
serve
mankind
to
his
whole
personality
clings
a
air
his
glance
about
the
room
is
compounded
of
curiosity
and
a
determined
optimism
when
he
looks
at
tana
the
entire
burden
of
uplifting
the
godless
oriental
is
in
his
eyes
his
name
frederick
paramore
was
at
harvard
anthony
because
of
the
initials
of
their
surnames
they
were
constantly
placed
next
to
each
other
in
classes
a
fragmentary
acquaintance
developed
but
since
that
time
they
have
never
paramore
the
room
with
a
certain
air
of
arriving
for
the
is
answering
a
tana
with
gone
to
inn
for
dinnah

back
gone
since
ha
past
six

i
hear
the
sounds
of
music
as
i
approached
the
house
tana
a
spasmodic
yes
i
play

one
of
the
japanese
instruments

quite
obviously
a
subscriber
to
the
national
geographic
tana

countree

song
paramore
it
sounded
very
nice
is
apparent
at
this
point
that
only
a
gigantic
effort
at
control
restrains
tana
from
rushing
for
his
post
cards
including
the
six
made
in
tana
i
fix
for
gentleman
paramore
no
thanks
i
do
use
it
tana
into
the
kitchen
leaving
the
intervening
door
slightly
ajar
from
the
crevice
there
suddenly
issues
again
the
melody
of
the
japanese
train
song
this
time
not
a
practice
surely
but
a
performance
a
lusty
spirited
phone
tana
in
his
harmonics
gives
no
heed
paramore
up
the
paramore
hello
yes
no

catch

hello
hello
hello
hello
huh
phone
obstinately
refuses
to
yield
up
any
more
sound
paramore
replaces
the
this
point
the
taxi
motif
wafting
with
it
a
second
young
man
he
carries
a
suitcase
and
opens
the
front
door
without
ringing
the
maury
the
oh
anthony
yoho
comes
into
the
large
room
and
paramore
how
do

at
him
with
gathering

and

vaguely
associated
the
face
with

even
positive
about
that
the
name
if
he
ever
knew
it
he
has
long
since
forgotten
however
with
a
fine
sensitiveness
and
an
equally
commendable
paramore
the
fact
and
tactfully
relieves
the
paramore

very
interesting

hear

i
was
talking
to
a
man
who
been
over
there
the
ensuing
testament
left
to
be
filled
in
by
the
reader
with
such
phrases
as
saw
with
his
own
eyes
splendid
spirit
of
france
and
salvation
of
civilization
maury
with
lowered
eyelids
dispassionately
maury

governess

whisper

confined
myself
to
fact
i
been
doing
a
good
deal
of
work

oh
immediate
glow
of
suspicion

into
his
eyes
it
is
as

himself
as
an
amateur

doing
service

by
a
clamor

of
two
sexes
in
conversation
and
laughter

of
anthony

of
parturition
his
memory
gives
up
the
fragment
fred
around
which
he
hastily
builds
the
sentence
glad
you
did
fred
meanwhile
the
slight
hush
prefatory
to
an
introduction
has
fallen
upon
the

anthony
ladies
and
gentlemen
this
is
this
is
fred
muriel
obliging
hello
fred
richard
caramel
paramore
each
other
intimately
by
their
first
names
the
latter
recollecting
dick
one
of
the
men
in
his
class
who
had
never
before
troubled
to
speak
to
dick
imagines
paramore
some
one
he
has
previously
met
anthony
three
young
women
go
maury
an
undertone
dick
have
seen
muriel
since
wedding
dick
she
now
in
her
prime
her
latest
is
i
say
so
anthony
for
a
while
paramore
at
length
attempts
to
make
the
conversation
general
by
asking
every
one
to
have
a
maury
i
done
pretty
well
on
this
bottle
i
gone
from
proof
down
to
distillery
indicates
the
words
on
the
anthony
paramore
never
can
tell
when
these
two
will
turn
up
said
to
them
one
afternoon
at
five
and
darned
if
they
appear
about
two
in
the
morning
a
big
hired
from
new
york
drove
up
to
the
door
and
out
they
stepped
drunk
as
lords
of
course
an
ecstasy
of
paramore
the
cover
of
a
book
which
he
holds
in
his
maury
dick
a
dick
paramore
you
work
here
in
town
paramore
no
i
in
the
laird
street
settlement
in
stamford
anthony
you
have
no
idea
of
the
amount
of
poverty
in
these
small
connecticut
towns
italians
and
other
immigrants
catholics
mostly
you
know
so
it
very
hard
to
reach
them
anthony
lot
of
crime
paramore
not
so
much
crime
as
ignorance
and
dirt
maury
that
my
theory
immediate
electrocution
of
all
ignorant
and
dirty
people
i
all
for
the
criminals
give
color
to
life
trouble
is
if
you
started
to
punish
ignorance
you
have
to
begin
in
the
first
families
then
you
could
take
up
the
moving
picture
people
and
finally
congress
and
the
clergy
paramore
i
was
speaking
of
the
more
fundamental
ignorance
of
even
our
language
maury
i
suppose
it
is
rather
hard
ca
even
keep
up
with
the
new
poetry
paramore
it
only
when
the
settlement
work
has
gone
on
for
months
that
one
realizes
how
bad
things
are
as
our
secretary
said
to
me
your
never
seem
dirty
until
you
wash
your
hands
of
course
already
attracting
much
attention
maury
as
your
secretary
might
say
if
you
stuff
paper
into
a
grate
it
burn
brightly
for
a
moment
this
gloria
tinted
and
lustful
of
admiration
and
entertainment
rejoins
the
party
followed
by
her
two
friends
for
several
moments
the
conversation
becomes
entirely
gloria
anthony
gloria
please
do
drink
much
anthony
anthony
why
gloria
because
you
so
simple
when
you
drunk
anthony
good
lord
what
the
matter
now
gloria
a
pause
during
which
her
eyes
gaze
coolly
into
several
things
in
the
first
place
why
do
you
insist
on
paying
for
everything
both
those
men
have
more
money
than
you
anthony
why
gloria
they
my
guests
gloria
that
no
reason
why
you
should
pay
for
a
bottle
of
champagne
rachael
barnes
smashed
dick
tried
to
fix
that
second
taxi
bill
and
you
would
let
him
anthony
why
gloria
gloria
when
we
have
to
keep
selling
bonds
to
even
pay
our
bills
time
to
cut
down
on
excess
generosities
moreover
i
would
be
quite
so
attentive
to
rachael
barnes
her
husband
does
like
it
any
more
than
i
do
anthony
why
gloria
gloria
him
why
gloria
but
that
happened
a
little
too
often
this
summer
with
every
pretty
woman
you
meet
grown
to
be
a
sort
of
habit
and
i
going
to
stand
it
if
you
can
play
around
i
can
too
as
an
by
the
way
this
fred
person
is
a
second
joe
hull
is
he
anthony
heavens
no
he
probably
came
up
to
get
me
to
wheedle
some
money
out
of
grandfather
for
his
flock
gloria
away
from
a
very
anthony
returns
to
her
nine
these
can
be
divided
into
two
classes
those
who
have
been
drinking
consistently
and
those
who
have
taken
little
or
nothing
in
the
second
group
are
barneses
muriel
frederick
e
paramore
muriel
i
wish
i
could
write
i
get
these
ideas
but
i
never
seem
to
be
able
to
put
them
in
words
dick
as
goliath
said
he
understood
how
david
felt
but
he
express
himself
the
remark
was
immediately
adopted
for
a
motto
by
the
philistines
muriel
i
do
get
you
i
must
be
getting
stupid
in
my
old
age
gloria
unsteadily
among
the
company
like
an
exhilarated
if
any
one
hungry
there
some
french
pastry
on
the
dining

those
victorian

engaged
in
conversation
upon
some
wholesome
subject
a
subject
so
wholesome
barnes
been
trying
for
several
moments
to
creep
into
the
more
tainted
air
around
the
central
lounge
paramore
lingering
in
the
gray
house
out
of
politeness
or
curiosity
or
in
order
at
some
future
time
to
make
a
sociological
report
on
the
decadence
of
american
life
is
maury
fred
i
imagined
you
were
very
paramore
i
am
muriel
me
too
i
believe
one
religion
as
good
as
another
and
everything
paramore
there
some
good
in
all
religions
muriel
i
a
catholic
but
as
i
always
say
i
not
working
at
it
paramore
a
tremendous
burst
of
the
catholic
religion
is
a
very
a
very
powerful
religion
maury
well
such
a
man
should
consider
the
raised
plane
of
sensation
and
the
stimulated
optimism
contained
in
this
cocktail
paramore
the
drink
rather
thanks
i
try
one
maury
one
outrageous
here
we
have
a
class
of
ten
reunion
and
you
refuse
to
be
even
a
little
pickled
come
on
a
health
to
king
charles
here
a
health
to
king
charles
bring
the

that
you
paramore
in
with
a
hearty
maury
fill
the
cup
frederick
you
know
everything
subordinated
to
nature
purposes
with
us
and
her
purpose
with
you
is
to
make
you
a
tippler
paramore
if
a
fellow
can
drink
like
a
gentleman
maury
what
is
a
gentleman
anyway
anthony
a
man
who
never
has
pins
under
his
coat
lapel
maury
nonsense
a
man
social
rank
is
determined
by
the
amount
of
bread
he
eats
in
a
sandwich
dick
he
a
man
who
prefers
the
first
edition
of
a
book
to
the
last
edition
of
a
newspaper
rachael
a
man
who
never
gives
an
impersonation
of
a
maury
an
american
who
can
fool
an
english
butler
into
thinking
one
muriel
a
man
who
comes
from
a
good
family
and
went
to
yale
or
harvard
or
princeton
and
has
money
and
dances
well
and
all
that
maury
at
last
the
perfect
definition
cardinal
newman
is
now
a
back
number
paramore
i
think
we
ought
to
look
on
the
question
more
was
it
abraham
lincoln
who
said
that
a
gentleman
is
one
who
never
inflicts
pain
maury
it
attributed
i
believe
to
general
ludendorff
paramore
surely
you
joking
maury
have
another
drink
paramore
i
ought
to
his
voice
maury
what
if
i
were
to
tell
you
this
is
the
third
drink
i
ever
taken
in
my
life
dick
the
phonograph
which
muriel
rise
and
sway
from
side
to
side
her
elbows
against
her
ribs
her
forearms
perpendicular
to
her
body
and
out
like
muriel
oh
let
take
up
the
rugs
and
dance

is
received
anthony

interior
groans
and
sickly
smiles
of
muriel
come
on
you
get
up
and
move
the
furniture
back
dick
wait
till
i
finish
my
drink
maury
on
his
purpose
paramore
i
tell
you
what
let
each
fill
one
glass
drink
it
off
and
then
we
dance
wave
of
protest
which
breaks
against
the
rock
muriel
my
head
is
simply
going
now
rachael
an
undertone
anthony
did
gloria
tell
you
to
stay
away
from
me
anthony
why
certainly
not
of
course
not
rachael
at
him
inscrutably
two
years
have
given
her
a
sort
of
hard
maury
up
his
here
to
the
defeat
of
democracy
and
the
fall
of
christianity
muriel
now
really
flashes
a
glance
maury
then
all
drink
with
varying
degrees
of
muriel
clear
the
floor
seems
inevitable
that
this
process
is
to
be
gone
through
anthony
gloria
in
the
great
moving
of
tables
piling
of
chairs
rolling
of
carpets
and
breaking
of
lamps
when
the
furniture
has
been
stacked

ugly

makes
a
ludicrous
and
grotesque
paramore
perceptibly
drunk
and
so
enraptured
with
the
notion
that
he
increases
the
effect
by
simulating
staggers

ominous
rigidity

without
humor

the
grotesque
the
unbelievable
the
histrionic

about

of
those
incidents
in

passionate
imitation

the
lowest

height

monstrous

be

the
color
of

are
parted
and
her
level
gaze
at

frightened

shuttleworth
that
is
all
he
turns
and
assisted
by
his
cane
goes
out
through
the
hall
through
the
front
door
and
with
hellish
portentousness
his
uncertain
footsteps
crunch
on
the
gravel
path
under
the
august
retrospect
in
this
extremity
they
were
like
two
goldfish
in
a
bowl
from
which
all
the
water
had
been
drawn
they
could
not
even
swim
across
to
each
other
gloria
would
be
in
may
there
was
nothing
she
had
said
that
she
wanted
except
to
be
young
and
beautiful
for
a
long
time
to
be
gay
and
happy
and
to
have
money
and
love
she
wanted
what
most
women
want
but
she
wanted
it
much
more
fiercely
and
passionately
she
had
been
married
over
two
years
at
first
there
had
been
days
of
serene
understanding
rising
to
ecstasies
of
proprietorship
and
pride
alternating
with
these
periods
had
occurred
sporadic
hates
enduring
a
short
hour
and
forgetfulnesses
lasting
no
longer
than
an
afternoon
that
had
been
for
half
a
year
then
the
serenity
the
content
had
become
less
jubilant
had
become
gray
very
rarely
with
the
spur
of
jealousy
or
forced
separation
the
ancient
ecstasies
returned
the
apparent
communion
of
soul
and
soul
the
emotional
excitement
it
was
possible
for
her
to
hate
anthony
for
as
much
as
a
full
day
to
be
carelessly
incensed
at
him
for
as
long
as
a
week
recrimination
had
displaced
affection
as
an
indulgence
almost
as
an
entertainment
and
there
were
nights
when
they
would
go
to
sleep
trying
to
remember
who
was
angry
and
who
should
be
reserved
next
morning
and
as
the
second
year
waned
there
had
entered
two
new
elements
gloria
realized
that
anthony
had
become
capable
of
utter
indifference
toward
her
a
temporary
indifference
more
than
half
lethargic
but
one
from
which
she
could
no
longer
stir
him
by
a
whispered
word
or
a
certain
intimate
smile
there
were
days
when
her
caresses
affected
him
as
a
sort
of
suffocation
she
was
conscious
of
these
things
she
never
entirely
admitted
them
to
herself
it
was
only
recently
that
she
perceived
that
in
spite
of
her
adoration
of
him
her
jealousy
her
servitude
her
pride
she
fundamentally
despised
him
and
her
contempt
blended
indistinguishably
with
her
other
emotions
all
this
was
her
love
the
vital
and
feminine
illusion
that
had
directed
itself
toward
him
one
april
night
many
months
before
on
anthony
part
she
was
in
spite
of
these
qualifications
his
sole
preoccupation
had
he
lost
her
he
would
have
been
a
broken
man
wretchedly
and
sentimentally
absorbed
in
her
memory
for
the
remainder
of
life
he
seldom
took
pleasure
in
an
entire
day
spent
alone
with
her
except
on
occasions
he
preferred
to
have
a
third
person
with
them
there
were
times
when
he
felt
that
if
he
were
not
left
absolutely
alone
he
would
go
mad
there
were
a
few
times
when
he
definitely
hated
her
in
his
cups
he
was
capable
of
short
attractions
toward
other
women
the
outcroppings
of
an
experimental
temperament
that
spring
that
summer
they
had
speculated
upon
future
happiness
how
they
were
to
travel
from
summer
land
to
summer
land
returning
eventually
to
a
gorgeous
estate
and
possible
idyllic
children
then
entering
diplomacy
or
politics
to
accomplish
for
a
while
beautiful
and
important
things
until
finally
as
a
beautifully
silkily
couple
they
were
to
loll
about
in
serene
glory
worshipped
by
the
bourgeoisie
of
the
land
these
times
were
to
begin
when
we
get
our
money
it
was
on
such
dreams
rather
than
on
any
satisfaction
with
their
increasingly
irregular
increasingly
dissipated
life
that
their
hope
rested
on
gray
mornings
when
the
jests
of
the
night
before
had
shrunk
to
ribaldries
without
wit
or
dignity
they
could
after
a
fashion
bring
out
this
batch
of
common
hopes
and
count
them
over
then
smile
at
each
other
and
repeat
by
way
of
clinching
the
matter
the
terse
yet
sincere
nietzscheanism
of
gloria
defiant
i
do
care
things
had
been
slipping
perceptibly
there
was
the
money
question
increasingly
annoying
increasingly
ominous
there
was
the
realization
that
liquor
had
become
a
practical
necessity
to
their
amusement
not
an
uncommon
phenomenon
in
the
british
aristocracy
of
a
hundred
years
ago
but
a
somewhat
alarming
one
in
a
civilization
steadily
becoming
more
temperate
and
more
circumspect
moreover
both
of
them
seemed
vaguely
weaker
in
fibre
not
so
much
in
what
they
did
as
in
their
subtle
reactions
to
the
civilization
about
them
in
gloria
had
been
born
something
that
she
had
hitherto
never
needed
the
skeleton
incomplete
but
nevertheless
unmistakable
of
her
ancient
abhorrence
a
conscience
this
admission
to
herself
was
coincidental
with
the
slow
decline
of
her
physical
courage
then
on
the
august
morning
after
adam
patch
unexpected
call
they
awoke
nauseated
and
tired
dispirited
with
life
capable
only
of
one
pervasive
emotion
fear
panic
well
anthony
sat
up
in
bed
and
looked
down
at
her
the
corners
of
his
lips
were
drooping
with
depression
his
voice
was
strained
and
hollow
her
reply
was
to
raise
her
hand
to
her
mouth
and
begin
a
slow
precise
nibbling
at
her
finger
we
done
it
he
said
after
a
pause
then
as
she
was
still
silent
he
became
exasperated
why
do
you
say
something
what
on
earth
do
you
want
me
to
say
what
are
you
thinking
nothing
then
stop
biting
your
finger
ensued
a
short
confused
discussion
of
whether
or
not
she
had
been
thinking
it
seemed
essential
to
anthony
that
she
should
muse
aloud
upon
last
night
disaster
her
silence
was
a
method
of
settling
the
responsibility
on
him
for
her
part
she
saw
no
necessity
for
speech
the
moment
required
that
she
should
gnaw
at
her
finger
like
a
nervous
child
i
got
to
fix
up
this
damn
mess
with
my
grandfather
he
said
with
uneasy
conviction
a
faint
newborn
respect
was
indicated
by
his
use
of
my
grandfather
instead
of
grampa
you
ca
she
affirmed
abruptly
you
ca
he
never
forgive
you
as
long
as
he
lives
perhaps
not
agreed
anthony
miserably
still
i
might
possibly
square
myself
by
some
sort
of
reformation
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
he
looked
sick
she
interrupted
pale
as
flour
he
sick
i
told
you
that
three
months
ago
i
wish
he
died
last
week
she
said
petulantly
inconsiderate
old
fool
neither
of
them
laughed
but
just
let
me
say
she
added
quietly
the
next
time
i
see
you
acting
with
any
woman
like
you
did
with
rachael
barnes
last
night
leave
you
like
that
i
simply
going
to
stand
it
anthony
quailed
oh
do
be
absurd
he
protested
you
know
there
no
woman
in
the
world
for
me
except
you
none
dearest
his
attempt
at
a
tender
note
failed
miserably
the
more
imminent
danger
stalked
back
into
the
foreground
if
i
went
to
him
suggested
anthony
and
said
with
appropriate
biblical
quotations
that
i
walked
too
long
in
the
way
of
unrighteousness
and
at
last
seen
the
light
he
broke
off
and
glanced
with
a
whimsical
expression
at
his
wife
i
wonder
what
he
do
i
do
know
she
was
speculating
as
to
whether
or
not
their
guests
would
have
the
acumen
to
leave
directly
after
breakfast
not
for
a
week
did
anthony
muster
the
courage
to
go
to
tarrytown
the
prospect
was
revolting
and
left
alone
he
would
have
been
incapable
of
making
the
trip
but
if
his
will
had
deteriorated
in
these
past
three
years
so
had
his
power
to
resist
urging
gloria
compelled
him
to
go
it
was
all
very
well
to
wait
a
week
she
said
for
that
would
give
his
grandfather
violent
animosity
time
to
cool
but
to
wait
longer
would
be
an
error
it
would
give
it
a
chance
to
harden
he
went
in
trepidation
and
vainly
adam
patch
was
not
well
said
shuttleworth
indignantly
positive
instructions
had
been
given
that
no
one
was
to
see
him
before
the
vindictive
eye
anthony
front
wilted
he
walked
out
to
his
taxicab
with
what
was
almost
a
slink
recovering
only
a
little
of
his
as
he
boarded
the
train
glad
to
escape
boylike
to
the
wonder
palaces
of
consolation
that
still
rose
and
glittered
in
his
own
mind
gloria
was
scornful
when
he
returned
to
marietta
why
had
he
not
forced
his
way
in
that
was
what
she
would
have
done
between
them
they
drafted
a
letter
to
the
old
man
and
after
considerable
revision
sent
it
off
it
was
half
an
apology
half
a
manufactured
explanation
the
letter
was
not
answered
came
a
day
in
september
a
day
slashed
with
alternate
sun
and
rain
sun
without
warmth
rain
without
freshness
on
that
day
they
left
the
gray
house
which
had
seen
the
flower
of
their
love
four
trunks
and
three
monstrous
crates
were
piled
in
the
dismantled
room
where
two
years
before
they
had
sprawled
lazily
thinking
in
terms
of
dreams
remote
languorous
content
the
room
echoed
with
emptiness
gloria
in
a
new
brown
dress
edged
with
fur
sat
upon
a
trunk
in
silence
and
anthony
walked
nervously
to
and
fro
smoking
as
they
waited
for
the
truck
that
would
take
their
things
to
the
city
what
are
those
she
demanded
pointing
to
some
books
piled
upon
one
of
the
crates
that
my
old
stamp
collection
he
confessed
sheepishly
i
forgot
to
pack
it
anthony
it
so
silly
to
carry
it
around
well
i
was
looking
through
it
the
day
we
left
the
apartment
last
spring
and
i
decided
not
to
store
it
ca
you
sell
it
have
we
enough
junk
i
sorry
he
said
humbly
with
a
thunderous
rattling
the
truck
rolled
up
to
the
door
gloria
shook
her
fist
defiantly
at
the
four
walls
i
so
glad
to
go
she
cried
so
glad
oh
my
god
how
i
hate
this
house
so
the
brilliant
and
beautiful
lady
went
up
with
her
husband
to
new
york
on
the
very
train
that
bore
them
away
they
quarrelled
her
bitter
words
had
the
frequency
the
regularity
the
inevitability
of
the
stations
they
passed
do
be
cross
begged
anthony
piteously
we
got
nothing
but
each
other
after
all
we
have
even
that
most
of
the
time
cried
gloria
when
have
we
a
lot
of
times
beginning
with
one
occasion
on
the
station
platform
at
redgate
you
do
mean
to
say
that
no
she
interrupted
coolly
i
do
brood
over
it
it
came
and
went
and
when
it
went
it
took
something
with
it
she
finished
abruptly
anthony
sat
in
silence
confused
depressed
the
drab
visions
of
mamaroneck
larchmont
rye
pelham
manor
succeeded
each
other
with
intervals
of
bleak
and
shoddy
wastes
posing
ineffectually
as
country
he
found
himself
remembering
how
on
one
summer
morning
they
two
had
started
from
new
york
in
search
of
happiness
they
had
never
expected
to
find
it
perhaps
yet
in
itself
that
quest
had
been
happier
than
anything
he
expected
forevermore
life
it
seemed
must
be
a
setting
up
of
props
around
one
otherwise
it
was
disaster
there
was
no
rest
no
quiet
he
had
been
futile
in
longing
to
drift
and
dream
no
one
drifted
except
to
maelstroms
no
one
dreamed
without
his
dreams
becoming
fantastic
nightmares
of
indecision
and
regret
pelham
they
had
quarrelled
in
pelham
because
gloria
must
drive
and
when
she
set
her
little
foot
on
the
accelerator
the
car
had
jumped
off
spunkily
and
their
two
heads
had
jerked
back
like
marionettes
worked
by
a
single
string
the
bronx
the
houses
gathering
and
gleaming
in
the
sun
which
was
falling
now
through
wide
refulgent
skies
and
tumbling
caravans
of
light
down
into
the
streets
new
york
he
supposed
was
home
the
city
of
luxury
and
mystery
of
preposterous
hopes
and
exotic
dreams
here
on
the
outskirts
absurd
stucco
palaces
reared
themselves
in
the
cool
sunset
poised
for
an
instant
in
cool
unreality
glided
off
far
away
succeeded
by
the
mazed
confusion
of
the
harlem
river
the
train
moved
in
through
the
deepening
twilight
above
and
past
half
a
hundred
cheerful
sweating
streets
of
the
upper
east
side
each
one
passing
the
car
window
like
the
space
between
the
spokes
of
a
gigantic
wheel
each
one
with
its
vigorous
colorful
revelation
of
poor
children
swarming
in
feverish
activity
like
vivid
ants
in
alleys
of
red
sand
from
the
tenement
windows
leaned
rotund
mothers
as
constellations
of
this
sordid
heaven
women
like
dark
imperfect
jewels
women
like
vegetables
women
like
great
bags
of
abominably
dirty
laundry
i
like
these
streets
observed
anthony
aloud
i
always
feel
as
though
it
a
performance
being
staged
for
me
as
though
the
second
i
passed
they
all
stop
leaping
and
laughing
and
instead
grow
very
sad
remembering
how
poor
they
are
and
retreat
with
bowed
heads
into
their
houses
you
often
get
that
effect
abroad
but
seldom
in
this
country
down
in
a
tall
busy
street
he
read
a
dozen
jewish
names
on
a
line
of
stores
in
the
door
of
each
stood
a
dark
little
man
watching
the
passers
from
intent
eyes
eyes
gleaming
with
suspicion
with
pride
with
clarity
with
cupidity
with
comprehension
new
york
he
could
not
dissociate
it
now
from
the
slow
upward
creep
of
this
people
the
little
stores
growing
expanding
consolidating
moving
watched
over
with
hawk
eyes
and
a
bee
attention
to
detail
they
slathered
out
on
all
sides
it
was
impressive
in
perspective
it
was
tremendous
gloria
voice
broke
in
with
strange
appropriateness
upon
his
thoughts
i
wonder
where
bloeckman
been
this
summer
the
apartment
after
the
sureties
of
youth
there
sets
in
a
period
of
intense
and
intolerable
complexity
with
the
this
period
is
so
short
as
to
be
almost
negligible
men
higher
in
the
scale
hold
out
longer
in
the
attempt
to
preserve
the
ultimate
niceties
of
relationship
to
retain
impractical
ideas
of
integrity
but
by
the
late
twenties
the
business
has
grown
too
intricate
and
what
has
hitherto
been
imminent
and
confusing
has
become
gradually
remote
and
dim
routine
comes
down
like
twilight
on
a
harsh
landscape
softening
it
until
it
is
tolerable
the
complexity
is
too
subtle
too
varied
the
values
are
changing
utterly
with
each
lesion
of
vitality
it
has
begun
to
appear
that
we
can
learn
nothing
from
the
past
with
which
to
face
the
future
so
we
cease
to
be
impulsive
convincible
men
interested
in
what
is
ethically
true
by
fine
margins
we
substitute
rules
of
conduct
for
ideas
of
integrity
we
value
safety
above
romance
we
become
quite
unconsciously
pragmatic
it
is
left
to
the
few
to
be
persistently
concerned
with
the
nuances
of
relationships
and
even
this
few
only
in
certain
hours
especially
set
aside
for
the
task
anthony
patch
had
ceased
to
be
an
individual
of
mental
adventure
of
curiosity
and
had
become
an
individual
of
bias
and
prejudice
with
a
longing
to
be
emotionally
undisturbed
this
gradual
change
had
taken
place
through
the
past
several
years
accelerated
by
a
succession
of
anxieties
preying
on
his
mind
there
was
first
of
all
the
sense
of
waste
always
dormant
in
his
heart
now
awakened
by
the
circumstances
of
his
position
in
his
moments
of
insecurity
he
was
haunted
by
the
suggestion
that
life
might
be
after
all
significant
in
his
early
twenties
the
conviction
of
the
futility
of
effort
of
the
wisdom
of
abnegation
had
been
confirmed
by
the
philosophies
he
had
admired
as
well
as
by
his
association
with
maury
noble
and
later
with
his
wife
yet
there
had
been
occasions
just
before
his
first
meeting
with
gloria
for
example
and
when
his
grandfather
had
suggested
that
he
should
go
abroad
as
a
war
correspondent
upon
which
his
dissatisfaction
had
driven
him
almost
to
a
positive
step
one
day
just
before
they
left
marietta
for
the
last
time
in
carelessly
turning
over
the
pages
of
a
harvard
alumni
bulletin
he
had
found
a
column
which
told
him
what
his
contemporaries
had
been
about
in
this
six
years
since
graduation
most
of
them
were
in
business
it
was
true
and
several
were
converting
the
heathen
of
china
or
america
to
a
nebulous
protestantism
but
a
few
he
found
were
working
constructively
at
jobs
that
were
neither
sinecures
nor
routines
there
was
calvin
boyd
for
instance
who
though
barely
out
of
medical
school
had
discovered
a
new
treatment
for
typhus
had
shipped
abroad
and
was
mitigating
some
of
the
civilization
that
the
great
powers
had
brought
to
servia
there
was
eugene
bronson
whose
articles
in
the
new
democracy
were
stamping
him
as
a
man
with
ideas
transcending
both
vulgar
timeliness
and
popular
hysteria
there
was
a
man
named
daly
who
had
been
suspended
from
the
faculty
of
a
righteous
university
for
preaching
marxian
doctrines
in
the
classroom
in
art
science
politics
he
saw
the
authentic
personalities
of
his
time
emerging
there
was
even
severance
the
who
had
given
up
his
life
rather
neatly
and
gracefully
with
the
foreign
legion
on
the
aisne
he
laid
down
the
magazine
and
thought
for
a
while
about
these
diverse
men
in
the
days
of
his
integrity
he
would
have
defended
his
attitude
to
the
last
an
epicurus
in
nirvana
he
would
have
cried
that
to
struggle
was
to
believe
to
believe
was
to
limit
he
would
as
soon
have
become
a
churchgoer
because
the
prospect
of
immortality
gratified
him
as
he
would
have
considered
entering
the
leather
business
because
the
intensity
of
the
competition
would
have
kept
him
from
unhappiness
but
at
present
he
had
no
such
delicate
scruples
this
autumn
as
his
year
began
he
was
inclined
to
close
his
mind
to
many
things
to
avoid
prying
deeply
into
motive
and
first
causes
and
mostly
to
long
passionately
for
security
from
the
world
and
from
himself
he
hated
to
be
alone
as
has
been
said
he
often
dreaded
being
alone
with
gloria
because
of
the
chasm
which
his
grandfather
visit
had
opened
before
him
and
the
consequent
revulsion
from
his
late
mode
of
life
it
was
inevitable
that
he
should
look
around
in
this
suddenly
hostile
city
for
the
friends
and
environments
that
had
once
seemed
the
warmest
and
most
secure
his
first
step
was
a
desperate
attempt
to
get
back
his
old
apartment
in
the
spring
of
he
had
signed
a
lease
at
seventeen
hundred
a
year
with
an
option
of
renewal
this
lease
had
expired
the
previous
may
when
he
had
first
rented
the
rooms
they
had
been
mere
potentialities
scarcely
to
be
discerned
as
that
but
anthony
had
seen
into
these
potentialities
and
arranged
in
the
lease
that
he
and
the
landlord
should
each
spend
a
certain
amount
in
improvements
rents
had
gone
up
in
the
past
four
years
and
last
spring
when
anthony
had
waived
his
option
the
landlord
a
sohenberg
had
realized
that
he
could
get
a
much
bigger
price
for
what
was
now
a
prepossessing
apartment
accordingly
when
anthony
approached
him
on
the
subject
in
september
he
was
met
with
sohenberg
offer
of
a
lease
at
hundred
a
year
this
it
seemed
to
anthony
was
outrageous
it
meant
that
well
over
a
third
of
their
income
would
be
consumed
in
rent
in
vain
he
argued
that
his
own
money
his
own
ideas
on
the
repartitioning
had
made
the
rooms
attractive
in
vain
he
offered
two
thousand
dollars
hundred
though
they
could
ill
afford
it
sohenberg
was
obdurate
it
seemed
that
two
other
gentlemen
were
considering
it
just
that
sort
of
an
apartment
was
in
demand
for
the
moment
and
it
would
scarcely
be
business
to
it
to
patch
besides
though
he
had
never
mentioned
it
before
several
of
the
other
tenants
had
complained
of
noise
during
the
previous
winter
singing
and
dancing
late
at
night
that
sort
of
thing
internally
raging
anthony
hurried
back
to
the
ritz
to
report
his
discomfiture
to
gloria
i
can
just
see
you
she
stormed
letting
him
back
you
down
what
could
i
say
you
could
have
told
him
what
he
i
would
have
it
no
other
man
in
the
world
would
have
stood
it
you
just
let
people
order
you
around
and
cheat
you
and
bully
you
and
take
advantage
of
you
as
if
you
were
a
silly
little
boy
it
absurd
oh
for
heaven
sake
do
lose
your
temper
i
know
anthony
but
you
such
an
ass
well
possibly
anyway
we
ca
afford
that
apartment
but
we
can
afford
it
better
than
living
here
at
the
ritz
you
were
the
one
who
insisted
on
coming
here
yes
because
i
knew
you
be
miserable
in
a
cheap
hotel
of
course
i
would
at
any
rate
we
got
to
find
a
place
to
live
how
much
can
we
pay
she
demanded
well
we
can
pay
even
his
price
if
we
sell
more
bonds
but
we
agreed
last
night
that
until
i
had
gotten
something
definite
to
do
oh
i
know
all
that
i
asked
you
how
much
we
can
pay
out
of
just
our
income
they
say
you
ought
not
to
pay
more
than
a
fourth
how
much
is
a
fourth
one
hundred
and
fifty
a
month
do
you
mean
to
say
we
got
only
six
hundred
dollars
coming
in
every
month
a
subdued
note
crept
into
her
voice
of
course
he
answered
angrily
do
you
think
we
gone
on
spending
more
than
twelve
thousand
a
year
without
cutting
way
into
our
capital
i
knew
we
sold
bonds
but
have
we
spent
that
much
a
year
how
did
we
her
awe
increased
oh
i
look
in
those
careful
we
kept
he
remarked
ironically
and
then
added
two
rents
a
good
part
of
the
time
clothes
travel
why
each
of
those
springs
in
california
cost
about
four
thousand
dollars
that
darn
car
was
an
expense
from
start
to
finish
and
parties
and
amusements
and
oh
one
thing
or
another
they
were
both
excited
now
and
inordinately
depressed
the
situation
seemed
worse
in
the
actual
telling
gloria
than
it
had
when
he
had
first
made
the
discovery
himself
you
got
to
make
some
money
she
said
suddenly
i
know
it
and
you
got
to
make
another
attempt
to
see
your
grandfather
i
will
when
when
we
get
settled
this
eventuality
occurred
a
week
later
they
rented
a
small
apartment
on
street
at
one
hundred
and
fifty
a
month
it
included
bedroom
kitchenette
and
bath
in
a
thin
apartment
house
and
though
the
rooms
were
too
small
to
display
anthony
best
furniture
they
were
clean
new
and
in
a
blonde
and
sanitary
way
not
unattractive
bounds
had
gone
abroad
to
enlist
in
the
british
army
and
in
his
place
they
tolerated
rather
than
enjoyed
the
services
of
a
gaunt
irishwoman
whom
gloria
loathed
because
she
discussed
the
glories
of
sinn
fein
as
she
served
breakfast
but
they
vowed
they
would
have
no
more
japanese
and
english
servants
were
for
the
present
hard
to
obtain
like
bounds
the
woman
prepared
only
breakfast
their
other
meals
they
took
at
restaurants
and
hotels
what
finally
drove
anthony
up
to
tarrytown
was
an
announcement
in
several
new
york
papers
that
adam
patch
the
multimillionaire
the
philanthropist
the
venerable
uplifter
was
seriously
ill
and
not
expected
to
recover
the
kitten
anthony
could
not
see
him
the
doctors
instructions
were
that
he
was
to
talk
to
no
one
said
shuttleworth
who
offered
kindly
to
take
any
message
that
anthony
might
care
to
intrust
with
him
and
deliver
it
to
adam
patch
when
his
condition
permitted
but
by
obvious
innuendo
he
confirmed
anthony
melancholy
inference
that
the
prodigal
grandson
would
be
particularly
unwelcome
at
the
bedside
at
one
point
in
the
conversation
anthony
with
gloria
positive
instructions
in
mind
made
a
move
as
though
to
brush
by
the
secretary
but
shuttleworth
with
a
smile
squared
his
brawny
shoulders
and
anthony
saw
how
futile
such
an
attempt
would
be
miserably
intimidated
he
returned
to
new
york
where
husband
and
wife
passed
a
restless
week
a
little
incident
that
occurred
one
evening
indicated
to
what
tension
their
nerves
were
drawn
walking
home
along
a
after
dinner
anthony
noticed
a
cat
prowling
near
a
railing
i
always
have
an
instinct
to
kick
a
cat
he
said
idly
i
like
them
i
yielded
to
it
once
when
oh
years
ago
before
i
met
you
one
night
between
the
acts
of
a
show
cold
night
like
this
and
i
was
a
little
tight
one
of
the
first
times
i
was
ever
tight
he
added
the
poor
little
beggar
was
looking
for
a
place
to
sleep
i
guess
and
i
was
in
a
mean
mood
so
it
took
my
fancy
to
kick
it
oh
the
poor
kitty
cried
gloria
sincerely
moved
inspired
with
the
narrative
instinct
anthony
enlarged
on
the
theme
it
was
pretty
bad
he
admitted
the
poor
little
beast
turned
around
and
looked
at
me
rather
plaintively
as
though
hoping
i
pick
him
up
and
be
kind
to
him
he
was
really
just
a
kitten
and
before
he
knew
it
a
big
foot
launched
out
at
him
and
caught
his
little
back
oh
gloria
cry
was
full
of
anguish
it
was
such
a
cold
night
he
continued
perversely
keeping
his
voice
upon
a
melancholy
note
i
guess
it
expected
kindness
from
somebody
and
it
got
only
pain
he
broke
off
suddenly
gloria
was
sobbing
they
had
reached
home
and
when
they
entered
the
apartment
she
threw
herself
upon
the
lounge
crying
as
though
he
had
struck
at
her
very
soul
oh
the
poor
little
kitty
she
repeated
piteously
the
poor
little
kitty
so
cold
gloria
do
come
near
me
please
do
come
near
me
you
killed
the
soft
little
kitty
touched
anthony
knelt
beside
her
dear
he
said
oh
gloria
darling
it
is
true
i
invented
it
every
word
of
it
but
she
would
not
believe
him
there
had
been
something
in
the
details
he
had
chosen
to
describe
that
made
her
cry
herself
asleep
that
night
for
the
kitten
for
anthony
for
herself
for
the
pain
and
bitterness
and
cruelty
of
all
the
world
the
passing
of
an
american
moralist
old
adam
died
on
a
midnight
of
late
november
with
a
pious
compliment
to
his
god
on
his
thin
lips
he
who
had
been
flattered
so
much
faded
out
flattering
the
omnipotent
abstraction
which
he
fancied
he
might
have
angered
in
the
more
lascivious
moments
of
his
youth
it
was
announced
that
he
had
arranged
some
sort
of
an
armistice
with
the
deity
the
terms
of
which
were
not
made
public
though
they
were
thought
to
have
included
a
large
cash
payment
all
the
newspapers
printed
his
biography
and
two
of
them
ran
short
editorials
on
his
sterling
worth
and
his
part
in
the
drama
of
industrialism
with
which
he
had
grown
up
they
referred
guardedly
to
the
reforms
he
had
sponsored
and
financed
the
memories
of
comstock
and
cato
the
censor
were
resuscitated
and
paraded
like
gaunt
ghosts
through
the
columns
every
newspaper
remarked
that
he
was
survived
by
a
single
grandson
anthony
comstock
patch
of
new
york
the
burial
took
place
in
the
family
plot
at
tarrytown
anthony
and
gloria
rode
in
the
first
carriage
too
worried
to
feel
grotesque
both
trying
desperately
to
glean
presage
of
fortune
from
the
faces
of
retainers
who
had
been
with
him
at
the
end
they
waited
a
frantic
week
for
decency
and
then
having
received
no
notification
of
any
kind
anthony
called
up
his
grandfather
lawyer
brett
was
not
he
was
expected
back
in
an
hour
anthony
left
his
telephone
number
it
was
the
last
day
of
november
cool
and
crackling
outside
with
a
lustreless
sun
peering
bleakly
in
at
the
windows
while
they
waited
for
the
call
ostensibly
engaged
in
reading
the
atmosphere
within
and
without
seemed
pervaded
with
a
deliberate
rendition
of
the
pathetic
fallacy
after
an
interminable
while
the
bell
jingled
and
anthony
starting
violently
took
up
the
receiver
hello
his
voice
was
strained
and
hollow
yes
i
did
leave
word
who
is
this
please
yes
why
it
was
about
the
estate
naturally
i
interested
and
i
received
no
word
about
the
reading
of
the
will
i
thought
you
might
not
have
my
address
what
yes
gloria
fell
on
her
knees
the
intervals
between
anthony
speeches
were
like
tourniquets
winding
on
her
heart
she
found
herself
helplessly
twisting
the
large
buttons
from
a
velvet
cushion
then
that
that
very
very
odd
that
very
odd
that
very
odd
not
even
any
ah
mention
or
any
ah
reason
his
voice
sounded
faint
and
far
away
she
uttered
a
little
sound
half
gasp
half
cry
yes
i
see
all
right
thanks
thanks
the
phone
clicked
her
eyes
looking
along
the
floor
saw
his
feet
cut
the
pattern
of
a
patch
of
sunlight
on
the
carpet
she
arose
and
faced
him
with
a
gray
level
glance
just
as
his
arms
folded
about
her
my
dearest
he
whispered
huskily
he
did
it
god
damn
him
next
day
who
are
the
heirs
asked
haight
you
see
when
you
can
tell
me
so
little
about
it
haight
was
tall
and
bent
and
he
had
been
recommended
to
anthony
as
an
astute
and
tenacious
lawyer
i
only
know
vaguely
answered
anthony
a
man
named
shuttleworth
who
was
a
sort
of
pet
of
his
has
the
whole
thing
in
charge
as
administrator
or
trustee
or
something
all
except
the
direct
bequests
to
charity
and
the
provisions
for
servants
and
for
those
two
cousins
in
idaho
how
distant
are
the
cousins
oh
third
or
fourth
anyway
i
never
even
heard
of
them
haight
nodded
comprehensively
and
you
want
to
contest
a
provision
of
the
will
i
guess
so
admitted
anthony
helplessly
i
want
to
do
what
sounds
most
hopeful
that
what
i
want
you
to
tell
me
you
want
them
to
refuse
probate
to
the
will
anthony
shook
his
head
you
got
me
i
have
any
idea
what
is
i
want
a
share
of
the
estate
suppose
you
tell
me
some
more
details
for
instance
do
you
know
why
the
testator
disinherited
you
why
yes
began
anthony
you
see
he
was
always
a
sucker
for
moral
reform
and
all
that
i
know
interjected
haight
and
i
do
suppose
he
ever
thought
i
was
much
good
i
did
go
into
business
you
see
but
i
feel
certain
that
up
to
last
summer
i
was
one
of
the
beneficiaries
we
had
a
house
out
in
marietta
and
one
night
grandfather
got
the
notion
he
come
over
and
see
us
it
just
happened
that
there
was
a
rather
gay
party
going
on
and
he
arrived
without
any
warning
well
he
took
one
look
he
and
this
fellow
shuttleworth
and
then
turned
around
and
tore
right
back
to
tarrytown
after
that
he
never
answered
my
letters
or
even
let
me
see
him
he
was
a
prohibitionist
was
he
he
was
everything
regular
religious
maniac
how
long
before
his
death
was
the
will
made
that
disinherited
you
recently
i
mean
since
august
and
you
think
that
the
direct
reason
for
his
not
leaving
you
the
majority
of
the
estate
was
his
displeasure
with
your
recent
actions
yes
haight
considered
upon
what
grounds
was
anthony
thinking
of
contesting
the
will
why
is
there
something
about
evil
influence
undue
influence
is
one
ground
but
it
the
most
difficult
you
would
have
to
show
that
such
pressure
was
brought
to
bear
so
that
the
deceased
was
in
a
condition
where
he
disposed
of
his
property
contrary
to
his
intentions
well
suppose
this
fellow
shuttleworth
dragged
him
over
to
marietta
just
when
he
thought
some
sort
of
a
celebration
was
probably
going
on
that
would
have
any
bearing
on
the
case
there
a
strong
division
between
advice
and
influence
you
have
to
prove
that
the
secretary
had
a
sinister
intention
i
suggest
some
other
grounds
a
will
is
automatically
refused
probate
in
case
of
insanity
drunkenness
here
anthony
smiled
or
through
premature
old
age
but
objected
anthony
his
private
physician
being
one
of
the
beneficiaries
would
testify
that
he
was
and
he
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
probably
did
just
what
he
intended
to
with
his
money
it
was
perfectly
consistent
with
everything
he
ever
done
in
his
life
well
you
see
is
a
great
deal
like
undue
influence
it
implies
that
the
property
was
disposed
of
as
originally
intended
the
most
common
ground
is
duress
physical
pressure
anthony
shook
his
head
not
much
chance
on
that
i
afraid
undue
influence
sounds
best
to
me
after
more
discussion
so
technical
as
to
be
largely
unintelligible
to
anthony
he
retained
haight
as
counsel
the
lawyer
proposed
an
interview
with
shuttleworth
who
jointly
with
wilson
hiemer
and
hardy
was
executor
of
the
will
anthony
was
to
come
back
later
in
the
week
it
transpired
that
the
estate
consisted
of
approximately
forty
million
dollars
the
largest
bequest
to
an
individual
was
of
one
million
to
edward
shuttleworth
who
received
in
addition
thirty
thousand
a
year
salary
as
administrator
of
the
trust
fund
left
to
be
doled
out
to
various
charities
and
reform
societies
practically
at
his
own
discretion
the
remaining
nine
millions
were
proportioned
among
the
two
cousins
in
idaho
and
about
other
beneficiaries
friends
secretaries
servants
and
employees
who
had
at
one
time
or
another
earned
the
seal
of
adam
patch
approval
at
the
end
of
another
fortnight
haight
on
a
retainer
fee
of
fifteen
thousand
dollars
had
begun
preparations
for
contesting
the
will
the
winter
of
discontent
before
they
had
been
two
months
in
the
little
apartment
on
street
it
had
assumed
for
both
of
them
the
same
indefinable
but
almost
material
taint
that
had
impregnated
the
gray
house
in
marietta
there
was
the
odor
of
tobacco
always
both
of
them
smoked
incessantly
it
was
in
their
clothes
their
blankets
the
curtains
and
the
carpets
added
to
this
was
the
wretched
aura
of
stale
wine
with
its
inevitable
suggestion
of
beauty
gone
foul
and
revelry
remembered
in
disgust
about
a
particular
set
of
glass
goblets
on
the
sideboard
the
odor
was
particularly
noticeable
and
in
the
main
room
the
mahogany
table
was
ringed
with
white
circles
where
glasses
had
been
set
down
upon
it
there
had
been
many
parties
people
broke
things
people
became
sick
in
gloria
bathroom
people
spilled
wine
people
made
unbelievable
messes
of
the
kitchenette
these
things
were
a
regular
part
of
their
existence
despite
the
resolutions
of
many
mondays
it
was
tacitly
understood
as
the
week
end
approached
that
it
should
be
observed
with
some
sort
of
unholy
excitement
when
saturday
came
they
would
not
discuss
the
matter
but
would
call
up
this
person
or
that
from
among
their
circle
of
sufficiently
irresponsible
friends
and
suggest
a
rendezvous
only
after
the
friends
had
gathered
and
anthony
had
set
out
decanters
would
he
murmur
casually
i
guess
i
have
just
one
myself
then
they
were
off
for
two
days
realizing
on
a
wintry
dawn
that
they
had
been
the
noisiest
and
most
conspicuous
members
of
the
noisiest
and
most
conspicuous
party
at
the
boul
mich
or
the
club
ramée
or
at
other
resorts
much
less
particular
about
the
hilarity
of
their
clientèle
they
would
find
that
they
had
somehow
squandered
eighty
or
ninety
dollars
how
they
never
knew
they
customarily
attributed
it
to
the
general
penury
of
the
friends
who
had
accompanied
them
it
began
to
be
not
unusual
for
the
more
sincere
of
their
friends
to
remonstrate
with
them
in
the
very
course
of
a
party
and
to
predict
a
sombre
end
for
them
in
the
loss
of
gloria
looks
and
constitution
the
story
of
the
summarily
interrupted
revel
in
marietta
had
of
course
leaked
out
in
detail
muriel
does
mean
to
tell
every
one
she
knows
said
gloria
to
anthony
but
she
thinks
every
one
she
tells
is
the
only
one
she
going
to
tell
and
diaphanously
veiled
the
tale
had
been
given
a
conspicuous
place
in
town
tattle
when
the
terms
of
adam
will
were
made
public
and
the
newspapers
printed
items
concerning
anthony
suit
the
story
was
beautifully
rounded
out
to
infinite
disparagement
they
began
to
hear
rumors
about
themselves
from
all
quarters
rumors
founded
usually
on
a
soupcon
of
truth
but
overlaid
with
preposterous
and
sinister
detail
outwardly
they
showed
no
signs
of
deterioration
gloria
at
was
still
the
gloria
of
twenty
her
complexion
a
fresh
damp
setting
for
her
candid
eyes
her
hair
still
a
childish
glory
darkening
slowly
from
corn
color
to
a
deep
russet
gold
her
slender
body
suggesting
ever
a
nymph
running
and
dancing
through
orphic
groves
masculine
eyes
dozens
of
them
followed
her
with
a
fascinated
stare
when
she
walked
through
a
hotel
lobby
or
down
the
aisle
of
a
theatre
men
asked
to
be
introduced
to
her
fell
into
prolonged
states
of
sincere
admiration
made
definite
love
to
her
for
she
was
still
a
thing
of
exquisite
and
unbelievable
beauty
and
for
his
part
anthony
had
rather
gained
than
lost
in
appearance
his
face
had
taken
on
a
certain
intangible
air
of
tragedy
romantically
contrasted
with
his
trim
and
immaculate
person
early
in
the
winter
when
all
conversation
turned
on
the
probability
of
america
going
into
the
war
when
anthony
was
making
a
desperate
and
sincere
attempt
to
write
muriel
kane
arrived
in
new
york
and
came
immediately
to
see
them
like
gloria
she
seemed
never
to
change
she
knew
the
latest
slang
danced
the
latest
dances
and
talked
of
the
latest
songs
and
plays
with
all
the
fervor
of
her
first
season
as
a
new
york
drifter
her
coyness
was
eternally
new
eternally
ineffectual
her
clothes
were
extreme
her
black
hair
was
bobbed
now
like
gloria
i
come
up
for
the
midwinter
prom
at
new
haven
she
announced
imparting
her
delightful
secret
though
she
must
have
been
older
then
than
any
of
the
boys
in
college
she
managed
always
to
secure
some
sort
of
invitation
imagining
vaguely
that
at
the
next
party
would
occur
the
flirtation
which
was
to
end
at
the
romantic
altar
where
you
been
inquired
anthony
unfailingly
amused
i
been
at
hot
springs
it
been
slick
and
peppy
this
fall
more
are
you
in
love
muriel
what
do
you
mean
this
was
the
rhetorical
question
of
the
year
i
going
to
tell
you
something
she
said
switching
the
subject
abruptly
i
suppose
it
none
of
my
business
but
i
think
it
time
for
you
two
to
settle
down
why
we
are
settled
down
yes
you
are
she
scoffed
archly
everywhere
i
go
i
hear
stories
of
your
escapades
let
me
tell
you
i
have
an
awful
time
sticking
up
for
you
you
need
bother
said
gloria
coldly
now
gloria
she
protested
you
know
i
one
of
your
best
friends
gloria
was
silent
muriel
continued
it
not
so
much
the
idea
of
a
woman
drinking
but
gloria
so
pretty
and
so
many
people
know
her
by
sight
all
around
that
it
naturally
conspicuous
what
have
you
heard
recently
demanded
gloria
her
dignity
going
down
before
her
curiosity
well
for
instance
that
that
party
in
marietta
grandfather
instantly
husband
and
wife
were
tense
with
annoyance
why
i
think
that
outrageous
that
what
they
say
persisted
muriel
stubbornly
anthony
paced
the
room
it
preposterous
he
declared
the
very
people
we
take
on
parties
shout
the
story
around
as
a
great
joke
and
eventually
it
gets
back
to
us
in
some
such
form
as
this
gloria
began
running
her
finger
through
a
stray
curl
muriel
licked
her
veil
as
she
considered
her
next
remark
you
ought
to
have
a
baby
gloria
looked
up
wearily
we
ca
afford
it
all
the
people
in
the
slums
have
them
said
muriel
triumphantly
anthony
and
gloria
exchanged
a
smile
they
had
reached
the
stage
of
violent
quarrels
that
were
never
made
up
quarrels
that
smouldered
and
broke
out
again
at
intervals
or
died
away
from
sheer
indifference
but
this
visit
of
muriel
drew
them
temporarily
together
when
the
discomfort
under
which
they
were
living
was
remarked
upon
by
a
third
party
it
gave
them
the
impetus
to
face
this
hostile
world
together
it
was
very
seldom
now
that
the
impulse
toward
reunion
sprang
from
within
anthony
found
himself
associating
his
own
existence
with
that
of
the
apartment
night
elevator
man
a
pale
scraggly
bearded
person
of
about
sixty
with
an
air
of
being
somewhat
above
his
station
it
was
probably
because
of
this
quality
that
he
had
secured
the
position
it
made
him
a
pathetic
and
memorable
figure
of
failure
anthony
recollected
without
humor
a
hoary
jest
about
the
elevator
man
career
being
a
matter
of
ups
and
downs
it
was
at
any
rate
an
enclosed
life
of
infinite
dreariness
each
time
anthony
stepped
into
the
car
he
waited
breathlessly
for
the
old
man
well
i
guess
we
going
to
have
some
sunshine
anthony
thought
how
little
rain
or
sunshine
he
would
enjoy
shut
into
that
close
little
cage
in
the
windowless
hall
a
darkling
figure
he
attained
tragedy
in
leaving
the
life
that
had
used
him
so
shabbily
three
young
gunmen
came
in
one
night
tied
him
up
and
left
him
on
a
pile
of
coal
in
the
cellar
while
they
went
through
the
trunk
room
when
the
janitor
found
him
next
morning
he
had
collapsed
from
chill
he
died
of
pneumonia
four
days
later
he
was
replaced
by
a
glib
martinique
negro
with
an
incongruous
british
accent
and
a
tendency
to
be
surly
whom
anthony
detested
the
passing
of
the
old
man
had
approximately
the
same
effect
on
him
that
the
kitten
story
had
had
on
gloria
he
was
reminded
of
the
cruelty
of
all
life
and
in
consequence
of
the
increasing
bitterness
of
his
own
he
was
writing
and
in
earnest
at
last
he
had
gone
to
dick
and
listened
for
a
tense
hour
to
an
elucidation
of
those
minutiae
of
procedure
which
hitherto
he
had
rather
scornfully
looked
down
upon
he
needed
money
immediately
he
was
selling
bonds
every
month
to
pay
their
bills
dick
was
frank
and
explicit
so
far
as
articles
on
literary
subjects
in
these
obscure
magazines
go
you
could
make
enough
to
pay
your
rent
of
course
if
a
man
has
the
gift
of
humor
or
a
chance
at
a
big
biography
or
some
specialized
knowledge
he
may
strike
it
rich
but
for
you
fiction
the
only
thing
you
say
you
need
money
right
away
i
certainly
do
well
it
be
a
year
and
a
half
before
you
make
any
money
out
of
a
novel
try
some
popular
short
stories
and
by
the
way
unless
exceptionally
brilliant
they
have
to
be
cheerful
and
on
the
side
of
the
heaviest
artillery
to
make
you
any
money
anthony
thought
of
dick
recent
output
which
had
been
appearing
in
a
monthly
it
was
concerned
chiefly
with
the
preposterous
actions
of
a
class
of
sawdust
effigies
who
one
was
assured
were
new
york
society
people
and
it
turned
as
a
rule
upon
questions
of
the
heroine
technical
purity
with
overtones
about
the
mad
antics
of
the
four
hundred
but
your
stories
exclaimed
anthony
aloud
almost
involuntarily
oh
that
different
dick
asserted
astoundingly
i
have
a
reputation
you
see
so
i
expected
to
deal
with
strong
themes
anthony
gave
an
interior
start
realizing
with
this
remark
how
much
richard
caramel
had
fallen
off
did
he
actually
think
that
these
amazing
latter
productions
were
as
good
as
his
first
novel
anthony
went
back
to
the
apartment
and
set
to
work
he
found
that
the
business
of
optimism
was
no
mean
task
after
half
a
dozen
futile
starts
he
went
to
the
public
library
and
for
a
week
investigated
the
files
of
a
popular
magazine
then
better
equipped
he
accomplished
his
first
story
the
dictaphone
of
fate
it
was
founded
upon
one
of
his
few
remaining
impressions
of
that
six
weeks
in
wall
street
the
year
before
it
purported
to
be
the
sunny
tale
of
an
office
boy
who
quite
by
accident
hummed
a
wonderful
melody
into
the
dictaphone
the
cylinder
was
discovered
by
the
boss
brother
a
producer
of
musical
comedy
and
then
immediately
lost
the
body
of
the
story
was
concerned
with
the
pursuit
of
the
missing
cylinder
and
the
eventual
marriage
of
the
noble
office
boy
now
a
successful
composer
to
miss
rooney
the
virtuous
stenographer
who
was
half
joan
of
arc
and
half
florence
nightingale
he
had
gathered
that
this
was
what
the
magazines
wanted
he
offered
in
his
protagonists
the
customary
denizens
of
the
literary
world
immersing
them
in
a
saccharine
plot
that
would
offend
not
a
single
stomach
in
marietta
he
had
it
typed
in
double
space
this
last
as
advised
by
a
booklet
success
as
a
writer
made
easy
by
meggs
widdlestien
which
assured
the
ambitious
plumber
of
the
futility
of
perspiration
since
after
a
course
he
could
make
at
least
a
thousand
dollars
a
month
after
reading
it
to
a
bored
gloria
and
coaxing
from
her
the
immemorial
remark
that
it
was
better
than
a
lot
of
stuff
that
gets
published
he
satirically
affixed
the
nom
de
plume
of
gilles
de
sade
enclosed
the
proper
return
envelope
and
sent
it
off
following
the
gigantic
labor
of
conception
he
decided
to
wait
until
he
heard
from
the
first
story
before
beginning
another
dick
had
told
him
that
he
might
get
as
much
as
two
hundred
dollars
if
by
any
chance
it
did
happen
to
be
unsuited
the
editor
letter
would
no
doubt
give
him
an
idea
of
what
changes
should
be
made
it
is
without
question
the
most
abominable
piece
of
writing
in
existence
said
anthony
the
editor
quite
conceivably
agreed
with
him
he
returned
the
manuscript
with
a
rejection
slip
anthony
sent
it
off
elsewhere
and
began
another
story
the
second
one
was
called
the
little
open
doors
it
was
written
in
three
days
it
concerned
the
occult
an
estranged
couple
were
brought
together
by
a
medium
in
a
vaudeville
show
there
were
six
altogether
six
wretched
and
pitiable
efforts
to
write
down
by
a
man
who
had
never
before
made
a
consistent
effort
to
write
at
all
not
one
of
them
contained
a
spark
of
vitality
and
their
total
yield
of
grace
and
felicity
was
less
than
that
of
an
average
newspaper
column
during
their
circulation
they
collected
all
told
rejection
slips
headstones
for
the
packages
that
he
would
find
lying
like
dead
bodies
at
his
door
in
gloria
father
died
and
they
went
again
to
kansas
city
a
miserable
trip
for
gloria
brooded
interminably
not
upon
her
father
death
but
on
her
mother
russel
gilbert
affairs
having
been
cleared
up
they
came
into
possession
of
about
three
thousand
dollars
and
a
great
amount
of
furniture
this
was
in
storage
for
he
had
spent
his
last
days
in
a
small
hotel
it
was
due
to
his
death
that
anthony
made
a
new
discovery
concerning
gloria
on
the
journey
east
she
disclosed
herself
astonishingly
as
a
bilphist
why
gloria
he
cried
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
believe
that
stuff
well
she
said
defiantly
why
not
because
it
it
fantastic
you
know
that
in
every
sense
of
the
word
you
an
agnostic
you
laugh
at
any
orthodox
form
of
christianity
and
then
you
come
out
with
the
statement
that
you
believe
in
some
silly
rule
of
reincarnation
what
if
i
do
i
heard
you
and
maury
and
every
one
else
for
whose
intellect
i
have
the
slightest
respect
agree
that
life
as
it
appears
is
utterly
meaningless
but
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
if
i
were
unconsciously
learning
something
here
it
might
not
be
so
meaningless
you
not
learning
anything
you
just
getting
tired
and
if
you
must
have
a
faith
to
soften
things
take
up
one
that
appeals
to
the
reason
of
some
one
beside
a
lot
of
hysterical
women
a
person
like
you
ought
to
accept
anything
unless
it
decently
demonstrable
i
do
care
about
truth
i
want
some
happiness
well
if
you
got
a
decent
mind
the
second
has
got
to
be
qualified
by
the
first
any
simple
soul
can
delude
himself
with
mental
garbage
i
do
care
she
held
out
stoutly
and
what
more
i
not
propounding
any
doctrine
the
argument
faded
off
but
reoccurred
to
anthony
several
times
thereafter
it
was
disturbing
to
find
this
old
belief
evidently
assimilated
from
her
mother
inserting
itself
again
under
its
immemorial
disguise
as
an
innate
idea
they
reached
new
york
in
march
after
an
expensive
and
week
spent
in
hot
springs
and
anthony
resumed
his
abortive
attempts
at
fiction
as
it
became
plainer
to
both
of
them
that
escape
did
not
lie
in
the
way
of
popular
literature
there
was
a
further
slipping
of
their
mutual
confidence
and
courage
a
complicated
struggle
went
on
incessantly
between
them
all
efforts
to
keep
down
expenses
died
away
from
sheer
inertia
and
by
march
they
were
again
using
any
pretext
as
an
excuse
for
a
party
with
an
assumption
of
recklessness
gloria
tossed
out
the
suggestion
that
they
should
take
all
their
money
and
go
on
a
real
spree
while
it
lasted
anything
seemed
better
than
to
see
it
go
in
unsatisfactory
driblets
gloria
you
want
parties
as
much
as
i
do
it
does
matter
about
me
everything
i
do
is
in
accordance
with
my
ideas
to
use
every
minute
of
these
years
when
i
young
in
having
the
best
time
i
possibly
can
how
about
after
that
after
that
i
wo
care
yes
you
will
well
i
may
but
i
wo
be
able
to
do
anything
about
it
and
i
have
had
my
good
time
you
be
the
same
then
after
a
fashion
we
had
our
good
time
raised
the
devil
and
we
in
the
state
of
paying
for
it
nevertheless
the
money
kept
going
there
would
be
two
days
of
gaiety
two
days
of
moroseness
an
endless
almost
invariable
round
the
sharp
when
they
occurred
resulted
usually
in
a
spurt
of
work
for
anthony
while
gloria
nervous
and
bored
remained
in
bed
or
else
chewed
abstractedly
at
her
fingers
after
a
day
or
so
of
this
they
would
make
an
engagement
and
then
oh
what
did
it
matter
this
night
this
glow
the
cessation
of
anxiety
and
the
sense
that
if
living
was
not
purposeful
it
was
at
any
rate
essentially
romantic
wine
gave
a
sort
of
gallantry
to
their
own
failure
meanwhile
the
suit
progressed
slowly
with
interminable
examinations
of
witnesses
and
marshallings
of
evidence
the
preliminary
proceedings
of
settling
the
estate
were
finished
haight
saw
no
reason
why
the
case
should
not
come
up
for
trial
before
summer
bloeckman
appeared
in
new
york
late
in
march
he
had
been
in
england
for
nearly
a
year
on
matters
concerned
with
films
par
excellence
the
process
of
general
refinement
was
still
in
progress
always
he
dressed
a
little
better
his
intonation
was
mellower
and
in
his
manner
there
was
perceptibly
more
assurance
that
the
fine
things
of
the
world
were
his
by
a
natural
and
inalienable
right
he
called
at
the
apartment
remained
only
an
hour
during
which
he
talked
chiefly
of
the
war
and
left
telling
them
he
was
coming
again
on
his
second
visit
anthony
was
not
at
home
but
an
absorbed
and
excited
gloria
greeted
her
husband
later
in
the
afternoon
anthony
she
began
would
you
still
object
if
i
went
in
the
movies
his
whole
heart
hardened
against
the
idea
as
she
seemed
to
recede
from
him
if
only
in
threat
her
presence
became
again
not
so
much
precious
as
desperately
necessary
oh
gloria
blockhead
said
he
put
me
in
only
if
i
ever
going
to
do
anything
i
have
to
start
now
they
only
want
young
women
think
of
the
money
anthony
for
you
yes
but
how
about
me
do
you
know
that
anything
i
have
is
yours
too
it
such
a
hell
of
a
career
he
burst
out
the
moral
the
infinitely
circumspect
anthony
and
such
a
hell
of
a
bunch
and
i
so
utterly
tired
of
that
fellow
bloeckman
coming
here
and
interfering
i
hate
theatrical
things
it
is
theatrical
it
utterly
different
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
chase
you
all
over
the
country
live
on
your
money
then
make
some
yourself
the
conversation
developed
into
one
of
the
most
violent
quarrels
they
had
ever
had
after
the
ensuing
reconciliation
and
the
inevitable
period
of
moral
inertia
she
realized
that
he
had
taken
the
life
out
of
the
project
neither
of
them
ever
mentioned
the
probability
that
bloeckman
was
by
no
means
disinterested
but
they
both
knew
that
it
lay
back
of
anthony
objection
in
april
war
was
declared
with
germany
wilson
and
his
cabinet
a
cabinet
that
in
its
lack
of
distinction
was
strangely
reminiscent
of
the
twelve
apostles
let
loose
the
carefully
starved
dogs
of
war
and
the
press
began
to
whoop
hysterically
against
the
sinister
morals
sinister
philosophy
and
sinister
music
produced
by
the
teutonic
temperament
those
who
fancied
themselves
particularly
made
the
exquisite
distinction
that
it
was
only
the
german
government
which
aroused
them
to
hysteria
the
rest
were
worked
up
to
a
condition
of
retching
indecency
any
song
which
contained
the
word
mother
and
the
word
kaiser
was
assured
of
a
tremendous
success
at
last
every
one
had
something
to
talk
about
and
almost
every
one
fully
enjoyed
it
as
though
they
had
been
cast
for
parts
in
a
sombre
and
romantic
play
anthony
maury
and
dick
sent
in
their
applications
for
and
the
two
latter
went
about
feeling
strangely
exalted
and
reproachless
they
chattered
to
each
other
like
college
boys
of
war
being
the
one
excuse
for
and
justification
of
the
aristocrat
and
conjured
up
an
impossible
caste
of
officers
to
be
composed
it
appeared
chiefly
of
the
more
attractive
alumni
of
three
or
four
eastern
colleges
it
seemed
to
gloria
that
in
this
huge
red
light
streaming
across
the
nation
even
anthony
took
on
a
new
glamour
the
tenth
infantry
arriving
in
new
york
from
panama
were
escorted
from
saloon
to
saloon
by
patriotic
citizens
to
their
great
bewilderment
west
pointers
began
to
be
noticed
for
the
first
time
in
years
and
the
general
impression
was
that
everything
was
glorious
but
not
half
so
glorious
as
it
was
going
to
be
pretty
soon
and
that
everybody
was
a
fine
fellow
and
every
race
a
great
race
always
excepting
the
germans
and
in
every
strata
of
society
outcasts
and
scapegoats
had
but
to
appear
in
uniform
to
be
forgiven
cheered
and
wept
over
by
relatives
and
utter
strangers
unfortunately
a
small
and
precise
doctor
decided
that
there
was
something
the
matter
with
anthony
he
could
not
conscientiously
pass
him
for
an
officers
the
broken
lute
their
third
anniversary
passed
uncelebrated
unnoticed
the
season
warmed
in
thaw
melted
into
hotter
summer
simmered
and
boiled
away
in
july
the
will
was
offered
for
probate
and
upon
the
contestation
was
assigned
by
the
surrogate
to
trial
term
for
trial
the
matter
was
prolonged
into
september
there
was
difficulty
in
empanelling
an
unbiassed
jury
because
of
the
moral
sentiments
involved
to
disappointment
a
verdict
was
finally
returned
in
favor
of
the
testator
whereupon
haight
caused
a
notice
of
appeal
to
be
served
upon
edward
shuttleworth
as
the
summer
waned
anthony
and
gloria
talked
of
the
things
they
were
to
do
when
the
money
was
theirs
and
of
the
places
they
were
to
go
to
after
the
war
when
they
would
agree
on
things
again
for
both
of
them
looked
forward
to
a
time
when
love
springing
like
the
phoenix
from
its
own
ashes
should
be
born
again
in
its
mysterious
and
unfathomable
haunts
he
was
drafted
early
in
the
fall
and
the
examining
doctor
made
no
mention
of
low
it
was
all
very
purposeless
and
sad
when
anthony
told
gloria
one
night
that
he
wanted
above
all
things
to
be
killed
but
as
always
they
were
sorry
for
each
other
for
the
wrong
things
at
the
wrong
times
they
decided
that
for
the
present
she
was
not
to
go
with
him
to
the
southern
camp
where
his
contingent
was
ordered
she
would
remain
in
new
york
to
use
the
apartment
to
save
money
and
to
watch
the
progress
of
the
case
which
was
pending
now
in
the
appellate
division
of
which
the
calendar
haight
told
them
was
far
behind
almost
their
last
conversation
was
a
senseless
quarrel
about
the
proper
division
of
the
income
at
a
word
either
would
have
given
it
all
to
the
other
it
was
typical
of
the
muddle
and
confusion
of
their
lives
that
on
the
october
night
when
anthony
reported
at
the
grand
central
station
for
the
journey
to
camp
she
arrived
only
in
time
to
catch
his
eye
over
the
anxious
heads
of
a
gathered
crowd
through
the
dark
light
of
the
enclosed
their
glances
stretched
across
a
hysterical
area
foul
with
yellow
sobbing
and
the
smells
of
poor
women
they
must
have
pondered
upon
what
they
had
done
to
one
another
and
each
must
have
accused
himself
of
drawing
this
sombre
pattern
through
which
they
were
tracing
tragically
and
obscurely
at
the
last
they
were
too
far
away
for
either
to
see
the
other
tears
book
three
chapter
i
a
matter
of
civilization
at
a
frantic
command
from
some
invisible
source
anthony
groped
his
way
inside
he
was
thinking
that
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
three
years
he
was
to
remain
longer
than
a
night
away
from
gloria
the
finality
of
it
appealed
to
him
drearily
it
was
his
clean
and
lovely
girl
that
he
was
leaving
they
had
arrived
he
thought
at
the
most
practical
financial
settlement
she
was
to
have
three
hundred
and
dollars
a
month
not
too
much
considering
that
over
half
of
that
would
go
in
rent
and
he
was
taking
fifty
to
supplement
his
pay
he
saw
no
need
for
more
food
clothes
and
quarters
would
be
provided
there
were
no
social
obligations
for
a
private
the
car
was
crowded
and
already
thick
with
breath
it
was
one
of
the
type
known
as
tourist
cars
a
sort
of
brummagem
pullman
with
a
bare
floor
and
straw
seats
that
needed
cleaning
nevertheless
anthony
greeted
it
with
relief
he
had
vaguely
expected
that
the
trip
south
would
be
made
in
a
in
one
end
of
which
would
stand
eight
horses
and
in
the
other
forty
men
he
had
heard
the
hommes
chevaux
story
so
often
that
it
had
become
confused
and
ominous
as
he
rocked
down
the
aisle
with
his
slung
at
his
shoulder
like
a
monstrous
blue
sausage
he
saw
no
vacant
seats
but
after
a
moment
his
eye
fell
on
a
single
space
at
present
occupied
by
the
feet
of
a
short
swarthy
sicilian
who
with
his
hat
drawn
over
his
eyes
hunched
defiantly
in
the
corner
as
anthony
stopped
beside
him
he
stared
up
with
a
scowl
evidently
intended
to
be
intimidating
he
must
have
adopted
it
as
a
defense
against
this
entire
gigantic
equation
at
anthony
sharp
that
seat
taken
he
very
slowly
lifted
the
feet
as
though
they
were
a
breakable
package
and
placed
them
with
some
care
upon
the
floor
his
eyes
remained
on
anthony
who
meanwhile
sat
down
and
unbuttoned
the
uniform
coat
issued
him
at
camp
upton
the
day
before
it
chafed
him
under
the
arms
before
anthony
could
scrutinize
the
other
occupants
of
the
section
a
young
second
lieutenant
blew
in
at
the
upper
end
of
the
car
and
wafted
airily
down
the
aisle
announcing
in
a
voice
of
appalling
acerbity
there
will
be
no
smoking
in
this
car
no
smoking
do
smoke
men
in
this
car
as
he
sailed
out
at
the
other
end
a
dozen
little
clouds
of
expostulation
arose
on
all
sides
oh
cripe
jeese
no
hey
come
back
here
fella
what
idea
two
or
three
cigarettes
were
shot
out
through
the
open
windows
others
were
retained
inside
though
kept
sketchily
away
from
view
from
here
and
there
in
accents
of
bravado
of
mockery
of
submissive
humor
a
few
remarks
were
dropped
that
soon
melted
into
the
listless
and
pervasive
silence
the
fourth
occupant
of
anthony
section
spoke
up
suddenly
liberty
he
said
sullenly
everything
except
bein
an
officer
dog
anthony
looked
at
him
he
was
a
tall
irishman
with
an
expression
moulded
of
indifference
and
utter
disdain
his
eyes
fell
on
anthony
as
though
he
expected
an
answer
and
then
upon
the
others
receiving
only
a
defiant
stare
from
the
italian
he
groaned
and
spat
noisily
on
the
floor
by
way
of
a
dignified
transition
back
into
taciturnity
a
few
minutes
later
the
door
opened
again
and
the
second
lieutenant
was
borne
in
upon
his
customary
official
zephyr
this
time
singing
out
a
different
tiding
all
right
men
smoke
if
you
want
to
my
mistake
men
it
all
right
men
go
on
and
smoke
my
mistake
this
time
anthony
had
a
good
look
at
him
he
was
young
thin
already
faded
he
was
like
his
own
mustache
he
was
like
a
great
piece
of
shiny
straw
his
chin
receded
faintly
this
was
offset
by
a
magnificent
and
unconvincing
scowl
a
scowl
that
anthony
was
to
connect
with
the
faces
of
many
young
officers
during
the
ensuing
year
immediately
every
one
smoked
whether
they
had
previously
desired
to
or
not
anthony
cigarette
contributed
to
the
hazy
oxidation
which
seemed
to
roll
back
and
forth
in
opalescent
clouds
with
every
motion
of
the
train
the
conversation
which
had
lapsed
between
the
two
impressive
visits
of
the
young
officer
now
revived
tepidly
the
men
across
the
aisle
began
making
clumsy
experiments
with
their
straw
seats
capacity
for
comparative
comfort
two
card
games
begun
soon
drew
several
spectators
to
sitting
positions
on
the
arms
of
seats
in
a
few
minutes
anthony
became
aware
of
a
persistently
obnoxious
sound
the
small
defiant
sicilian
had
fallen
audibly
asleep
it
was
wearisome
to
contemplate
that
animate
protoplasm
reasonable
by
courtesy
only
shut
up
in
a
car
by
an
incomprehensible
civilization
taken
somewhere
to
do
a
vague
something
without
aim
or
significance
or
consequence
anthony
sighed
opened
a
newspaper
which
he
had
no
recollection
of
buying
and
began
to
read
by
the
dim
yellow
light
ten
bumped
stuffily
into
eleven
the
hours
clogged
and
caught
and
slowed
down
amazingly
the
train
halted
along
the
dark
countryside
from
time
to
time
indulging
in
short
deceitful
movements
backward
or
forward
and
whistling
harsh
paeans
into
the
high
october
night
having
read
his
newspaper
through
editorials
cartoons
and
his
eye
fell
on
a
headed
it
seemed
that
the
shakespeareville
chamber
of
commerce
had
recently
held
an
enthusiastic
debate
as
to
whether
the
american
soldiers
should
be
known
as
sammies
or
battling
christians
the
thought
gagged
him
he
dropped
the
newspaper
yawned
and
let
his
mind
drift
off
at
a
tangent
he
wondered
why
gloria
had
been
late
it
seemed
so
long
ago
already
he
had
a
pang
of
illusive
loneliness
he
tried
to
imagine
from
what
angle
she
would
regard
her
new
position
what
place
in
her
considerations
he
would
continue
to
hold
the
thought
acted
as
a
further
depressant
he
opened
his
paper
and
began
to
read
again
the
members
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
in
shakespeareville
had
decided
upon
liberty
lads
for
two
nights
and
two
days
they
rattled
southward
making
mysterious
inexplicable
stops
in
what
were
apparently
arid
wastes
and
then
rushing
through
large
cities
with
a
pompous
air
of
hurry
the
whimsicalities
of
this
train
foreshadowed
for
anthony
the
whimsicalities
of
all
army
administration
in
the
arid
wastes
they
were
served
from
the
with
beans
and
bacon
that
at
first
he
was
unable
to
eat
he
dined
scantily
on
some
milk
chocolate
distributed
by
a
village
canteen
but
on
the
second
day
the
output
began
to
appear
surprisingly
palatable
on
the
third
morning
the
rumor
was
passed
along
that
within
the
hour
they
would
arrive
at
their
destination
camp
hooker
it
had
become
intolerably
hot
in
the
car
and
the
men
were
all
in
shirt
sleeves
the
sun
came
in
through
the
windows
a
tired
and
ancient
sun
yellow
as
parchment
and
stretched
out
of
shape
in
transit
it
tried
to
enter
in
triumphant
squares
and
produced
only
warped
splotches
but
it
was
appallingly
steady
so
much
so
that
it
disturbed
anthony
not
to
be
the
pivot
of
all
the
inconsequential
sawmills
and
trees
and
telegraph
poles
that
were
turning
around
him
so
fast
outside
it
played
its
heavy
tremolo
over
olive
roads
and
fallow
back
of
which
ran
a
ragged
line
of
woods
broken
with
eminences
of
gray
rock
the
foreground
was
dotted
sparsely
with
wretched
shanties
among
which
there
would
flash
by
now
and
then
a
specimen
of
the
languid
yokelry
of
south
carolina
or
else
a
strolling
darky
with
sullen
and
bewildered
eyes
then
the
woods
moved
off
and
they
rolled
into
a
broad
space
like
the
baked
top
of
a
gigantic
cake
sugared
with
an
infinity
of
tents
arranged
in
geometric
figures
over
its
surface
the
train
came
to
an
uncertain
stop
and
the
sun
and
the
poles
and
the
trees
faded
and
his
universe
rocked
itself
slowly
back
to
its
old
usualness
with
anthony
patch
in
the
centre
as
the
men
weary
and
perspiring
crowded
out
of
the
car
he
smelt
that
unforgetable
aroma
that
impregnates
all
permanent
camps
the
odor
of
garbage
camp
hooker
was
an
astonishing
and
spectacular
growth
suggesting
a
mining
town
in
the
second
week
it
was
a
thing
of
wooden
shacks
and
tents
connected
by
a
pattern
of
roads
with
hard
tan
fringed
with
trees
here
and
there
stood
green
houses
unpromising
oases
with
their
muggy
odor
of
wet
flannels
and
closed
and
across
from
each
of
them
there
was
usually
a
canteen
swarming
with
life
presided
over
indolently
by
an
officer
who
with
the
aid
of
a
usually
managed
to
make
his
detail
a
pleasant
and
chatty
sinecure
up
and
down
the
dusty
roads
sped
the
soldiers
of
the
quartermaster
corps
also
in
up
and
down
drove
the
generals
in
their
government
automobiles
stopping
now
and
then
to
bring
unalert
details
to
attention
to
frown
heavily
upon
captains
marching
at
the
heads
of
companies
to
set
the
pompous
pace
in
that
gorgeous
game
of
showing
off
which
was
taking
place
triumphantly
over
the
entire
area
the
first
week
after
the
arrival
of
anthony
draft
was
filled
with
a
series
of
interminable
inoculations
and
physical
examinations
and
with
the
preliminary
drilling
the
days
left
him
desperately
tired
he
had
been
issued
the
wrong
size
shoes
by
a
popular
and
in
consequence
his
feet
were
so
swollen
that
the
last
hours
of
the
afternoon
were
an
acute
torture
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
could
throw
himself
down
on
his
cot
between
dinner
and
afternoon
and
seeming
to
sink
with
each
moment
deeper
into
a
bottomless
bed
drop
off
immediately
to
sleep
while
the
noise
and
laughter
around
him
faded
to
a
pleasant
drone
of
drowsy
summer
sound
in
the
morning
he
awoke
stiff
and
aching
hollow
as
a
ghost
and
hurried
forth
to
meet
the
other
ghostly
figures
who
swarmed
in
the
wan
company
streets
while
a
harsh
bugle
shrieked
and
spluttered
at
the
gray
heavens
he
was
in
a
skeleton
infantry
company
of
about
a
hundred
men
after
the
invariable
breakfast
of
fatty
bacon
cold
toast
and
cereal
the
entire
hundred
would
rush
for
the
latrines
which
however
seemed
always
intolerable
like
the
lavatories
in
cheap
hotels
out
on
the
field
then
in
ragged
order
the
lame
man
on
his
left
grotesquely
marring
anthony
listless
efforts
to
keep
in
step
the
platoon
sergeants
either
showing
off
violently
to
impress
the
officers
and
recruits
or
else
quietly
lurking
in
close
to
the
line
of
march
avoiding
both
labor
and
unnecessary
visibility
when
they
reached
the
field
work
began
immediately
they
peeled
off
their
shirts
for
calisthenics
this
was
the
only
part
of
the
day
that
anthony
enjoyed
lieutenant
kretching
who
presided
at
the
antics
was
sinewy
and
muscular
and
anthony
followed
his
movements
faithfully
with
a
feeling
that
he
was
doing
something
of
positive
value
to
himself
the
other
officers
and
sergeants
walked
about
among
the
men
with
the
malice
of
schoolboys
grouping
here
and
there
around
some
unfortunate
who
lacked
muscular
control
giving
him
confused
instructions
and
commands
when
they
discovered
a
particularly
forlorn
specimen
they
would
linger
the
full
making
cutting
remarks
and
snickering
among
themselves
one
little
officer
named
hopkins
who
had
been
a
sergeant
in
the
regular
army
was
particularly
annoying
he
took
the
war
as
a
gift
of
revenge
from
the
high
gods
to
himself
and
the
constant
burden
of
his
harangues
was
that
these
rookies
did
not
appreciate
the
full
gravity
and
responsibility
of
the
service
he
considered
that
by
a
combination
of
foresight
and
dauntless
efficiency
he
had
raised
himself
to
his
current
magnificence
he
aped
the
particular
tyrannies
of
every
officer
under
whom
he
had
served
in
times
gone
by
his
frown
was
frozen
on
his
brow
before
giving
a
private
a
pass
to
go
to
town
he
would
ponderously
weigh
the
effect
of
such
an
absence
upon
the
company
the
army
and
the
welfare
of
the
military
profession
the
world
over
lieutenant
kretching
blond
dull
and
phlegmatic
introduced
anthony
ponderously
to
the
problems
of
attention
right
face
about
face
and
at
ease
his
principal
defect
was
his
forgetfulness
he
often
kept
the
company
straining
and
aching
at
attention
for
five
minutes
while
he
stood
out
in
front
and
explained
a
new
movement
as
a
result
only
the
men
in
the
centre
knew
what
it
was
all
about
those
on
both
flanks
had
been
too
emphatically
impressed
with
the
necessity
of
staring
straight
ahead
the
drill
continued
until
noon
it
consisted
of
stressing
a
succession
of
infinitely
remote
details
and
though
anthony
perceived
that
this
was
consistent
with
the
logic
of
war
it
none
the
less
irritated
him
that
the
same
faulty
which
would
have
been
indecent
in
an
officer
did
not
interfere
with
the
duties
of
a
private
was
a
preposterous
incongruity
sometimes
after
listening
to
a
sustained
invective
concerned
with
a
dull
and
on
the
face
of
it
absurd
subject
known
as
military
courtesy
he
suspected
that
the
dim
purpose
of
the
war
was
to
let
the
regular
army
officers
men
with
the
mentality
and
aspirations
of
schoolboys
have
their
fling
with
some
real
slaughter
he
was
being
grotesquely
sacrificed
to
the
patience
of
a
hopkins
of
his
three
a
conscientious
objector
from
tennessee
a
big
scared
pole
and
the
disdainful
celt
whom
he
had
sat
beside
on
the
train
the
two
former
spent
the
evenings
in
writing
eternal
letters
home
while
the
irishman
sat
in
the
tent
door
whistling
over
and
over
to
himself
half
a
dozen
shrill
and
monotonous
it
was
rather
to
avoid
an
hour
of
their
company
than
with
any
hope
of
diversion
that
when
the
quarantine
was
lifted
at
the
end
of
the
week
he
went
into
town
he
caught
one
of
the
swarm
of
jitneys
that
overran
the
camp
each
evening
and
in
half
an
hour
was
set
down
in
front
of
the
stonewall
hotel
on
the
hot
and
drowsy
main
street
under
the
gathering
twilight
the
town
was
unexpectedly
attractive
the
sidewalks
were
peopled
by
vividly
dressed
overpainted
girls
who
chattered
volubly
in
low
lazy
voices
by
dozens
of
who
assailed
passing
officers
with
take
y
anywheh
and
by
an
intermittent
procession
of
ragged
shuffling
subservient
negroes
anthony
loitering
along
through
the
warm
dusk
felt
for
the
first
time
in
years
the
slow
erotic
breath
of
the
south
imminent
in
the
hot
softness
of
the
air
in
the
pervasive
lull
of
thought
and
time
he
had
gone
about
a
block
when
he
was
arrested
suddenly
by
a
harsh
command
at
his
elbow
have
you
been
taught
to
salute
officers
he
looked
dumbly
at
the
man
who
addressed
him
a
stout
captain
who
fixed
him
menacingly
with
brown
to
attention
the
words
were
literally
thundered
a
few
pedestrians
near
by
stopped
and
stared
a
girl
in
a
lilac
dress
tittered
to
her
companion
anthony
came
to
attention
what
your
regiment
and
company
anthony
told
him
after
this
when
you
pass
an
officer
on
the
street
you
straighten
up
and
salute
all
right
say
sir
yes
sir
the
stout
officer
grunted
turned
sharply
and
marched
down
the
street
after
a
moment
anthony
moved
on
the
town
was
no
longer
indolent
and
exotic
the
magic
was
suddenly
gone
out
of
the
dusk
his
eyes
were
turned
precipitately
inward
upon
the
indignity
of
his
position
he
hated
that
officer
every
officer
life
was
unendurable
after
he
had
gone
half
a
block
he
realized
that
the
girl
in
the
lilac
dress
who
had
giggled
at
his
discomfiture
was
walking
with
her
friend
about
ten
paces
ahead
of
him
several
times
she
had
turned
and
stared
at
anthony
with
cheerful
laughter
in
the
large
eyes
that
seemed
the
same
color
as
her
gown
at
the
corner
she
and
her
companion
visibly
slackened
their
pace
he
must
make
his
choice
between
joining
them
and
passing
obliviously
by
he
passed
hesitated
then
slowed
down
in
a
moment
the
pair
were
abreast
of
him
again
dissolved
in
laughter
now
not
such
strident
mirth
as
he
would
have
expected
in
the
north
from
actresses
in
this
familiar
comedy
but
a
soft
low
rippling
like
the
overflow
from
some
subtle
joke
into
which
he
had
inadvertently
blundered
how
do
you
do
he
said
her
eyes
were
soft
as
shadows
were
they
violet
or
was
it
their
blue
darkness
mingling
with
the
gray
hues
of
dusk
pleasant
evening
ventured
anthony
uncertainly
sure
is
said
the
second
girl
has
been
a
very
pleasant
evening
for
you
sighed
the
girl
in
lilac
her
voice
seemed
as
much
a
part
of
the
night
as
the
drowsy
breeze
stirring
the
wide
brim
of
her
hat
he
had
to
have
a
chance
to
show
off
said
anthony
with
a
scornful
laugh
reckon
so
she
agreed
they
turned
the
corner
and
moved
lackadaisically
up
a
side
street
as
if
following
a
drifting
cable
to
which
they
were
attached
in
this
town
it
seemed
entirely
natural
to
turn
corners
like
that
it
seemed
natural
to
be
bound
nowhere
in
particular
to
be
thinking
nothing
the
side
street
was
dark
a
sudden
offshoot
into
a
district
of
wild
rose
hedges
and
little
quiet
houses
set
far
back
from
the
street
where
you
going
he
inquired
politely
just
goin
the
answer
was
an
apology
a
question
an
explanation
can
i
stroll
along
with
you
reckon
so
it
was
an
advantage
that
her
accent
was
different
he
could
not
have
determined
the
social
status
of
a
southerner
from
her
talk
in
new
york
a
girl
of
a
lower
class
would
have
been
raucous
unendurable
except
through
the
rosy
spectacles
of
intoxication
dark
was
creeping
down
talking
little
anthony
in
careless
casual
questions
the
other
two
with
provincial
economy
of
phrase
and
burden
they
sauntered
past
another
corner
and
another
in
the
middle
of
a
block
they
stopped
beneath
a
i
live
near
here
explained
the
other
girl
i
live
around
the
block
said
the
girl
in
lilac
can
i
see
you
home
to
the
corner
if
you
want
to
the
other
girl
took
a
few
steps
backward
anthony
removed
his
hat
you
supposed
to
salute
said
the
girl
in
lilac
with
a
laugh
all
the
soldiers
salute
i
learn
he
responded
soberly
the
other
girl
said
well
hesitated
then
added
call
me
up
dot
and
retreated
from
the
yellow
circle
of
the
then
in
silence
anthony
and
the
girl
in
lilac
walked
the
three
blocks
to
the
small
rickety
house
which
was
her
home
outside
the
wooden
gate
she
hesitated
well
thanks
must
you
go
in
so
soon
i
ought
to
ca
you
stroll
around
a
little
longer
she
regarded
him
dispassionately
i
do
even
know
you
anthony
laughed
it
not
too
late
i
reckon
i
better
go
in
i
thought
we
might
walk
down
and
see
a
movie
i
like
to
then
i
could
bring
you
home
i
have
just
enough
time
i
got
to
be
in
camp
by
eleven
it
was
so
dark
that
he
could
scarcely
see
her
now
she
was
a
dress
swayed
infinitesimally
by
the
wind
two
limpid
reckless
eyes
why
do
you
come
dot
do
you
like
movies
better
come
she
shook
her
head
i
ought
to
he
liked
her
realizing
that
she
was
temporizing
for
the
effect
on
him
he
came
closer
and
took
her
hand
if
we
get
back
by
ten
ca
you
just
to
the
movies
well
i
reckon
so
hand
in
hand
they
walked
back
toward
along
a
hazy
dusky
street
where
a
negro
newsboy
was
calling
an
extra
in
the
cadence
of
the
local
venders
tradition
a
cadence
that
was
as
musical
as
song
dot
anthony
affair
with
dorothy
raycroft
was
an
inevitable
result
of
his
increasing
carelessness
about
himself
he
did
not
go
to
her
desiring
to
possess
the
desirable
nor
did
he
fall
before
a
personality
more
vital
more
compelling
than
his
own
as
he
had
done
with
gloria
four
years
before
he
merely
slid
into
the
matter
through
his
inability
to
make
definite
judgments
he
could
say
no
neither
to
man
nor
woman
borrower
and
temptress
alike
found
him
and
pliable
indeed
he
seldom
made
decisions
at
all
and
when
he
did
they
were
but
resolves
formed
in
the
panic
of
some
aghast
and
irreparable
awakening
the
particular
weakness
he
indulged
on
this
occasion
was
his
need
of
excitement
and
stimulus
from
without
he
felt
that
for
the
first
time
in
four
years
he
could
express
and
interpret
himself
anew
the
girl
promised
rest
the
hours
in
her
company
each
evening
alleviated
the
morbid
and
inevitably
futile
poundings
of
his
imagination
he
had
become
a
coward
in
earnest
completely
the
slave
of
a
hundred
disordered
and
prowling
thoughts
which
were
released
by
the
collapse
of
the
authentic
devotion
to
gloria
that
had
been
the
chief
jailer
of
his
insufficiency
on
that
first
night
as
they
stood
by
the
gate
he
kissed
dorothy
and
made
an
engagement
to
meet
her
the
following
saturday
then
he
went
out
to
camp
and
with
the
light
burning
lawlessly
in
his
tent
he
wrote
a
long
letter
to
gloria
a
glowing
letter
full
of
the
sentimental
dark
full
of
the
remembered
breath
of
flowers
full
of
a
true
and
exceeding
tenderness
these
things
he
had
learned
again
for
a
moment
in
a
kiss
given
and
taken
under
a
rich
warm
moonlight
just
an
hour
before
when
saturday
night
came
he
found
dot
waiting
at
the
entrance
of
the
bijou
moving
picture
theatre
she
was
dressed
as
on
the
preceding
wednesday
in
her
lilac
gown
of
frailest
organdy
but
it
had
evidently
been
washed
and
starched
since
then
for
it
was
fresh
and
unrumpled
daylight
confirmed
the
impression
he
had
received
that
in
a
sketchy
faulty
way
she
was
lovely
she
was
clean
her
features
were
small
irregular
but
eloquent
and
appropriate
to
each
other
she
was
a
dark
unenduring
little
flower
yet
he
thought
he
detected
in
her
some
quality
of
spiritual
reticence
of
strength
drawn
from
her
passive
acceptance
of
all
things
in
this
he
was
mistaken
dorothy
raycroft
was
nineteen
her
father
had
kept
a
small
unprosperous
corner
store
and
she
had
graduated
from
high
school
in
the
lowest
fourth
of
her
class
two
days
before
he
died
at
high
school
she
had
enjoyed
a
rather
unsavory
reputation
as
a
matter
of
fact
her
behavior
at
the
class
picnic
where
the
rumors
started
had
been
merely
indiscreet
she
had
retained
her
technical
purity
until
over
a
year
later
the
boy
had
been
a
clerk
in
a
store
on
jackson
street
and
on
the
day
after
the
incident
he
departed
unexpectedly
to
new
york
he
had
been
intending
to
leave
for
some
time
but
had
tarried
for
the
consummation
of
his
amorous
enterprise
after
a
while
she
confided
the
adventure
to
a
girl
friend
and
later
as
she
watched
her
friend
disappear
down
the
sleepy
street
of
dusty
sunshine
she
knew
in
a
flash
of
intuition
that
her
story
was
going
out
into
the
world
yet
after
telling
it
she
felt
much
better
and
a
little
bitter
and
made
as
near
an
approach
to
character
as
she
was
capable
of
by
walking
in
another
direction
and
meeting
another
man
with
the
honest
intention
of
gratifying
herself
again
as
a
rule
things
happened
to
dot
she
was
not
weak
because
there
was
nothing
in
her
to
tell
her
she
was
being
weak
she
was
not
strong
because
she
never
knew
that
some
of
the
things
she
did
were
brave
she
neither
defied
nor
conformed
nor
compromised
she
had
no
sense
of
humor
but
to
take
its
place
a
happy
disposition
that
made
her
laugh
at
the
proper
times
when
she
was
with
men
she
had
no
definite
intentions
sometimes
she
regretted
vaguely
that
her
reputation
precluded
what
chance
she
had
ever
had
for
security
there
had
been
no
open
discovery
her
mother
was
interested
only
in
starting
her
off
on
time
each
morning
for
the
jewelry
store
where
she
earned
fourteen
dollars
a
week
but
some
of
the
boys
she
had
known
in
high
school
now
looked
the
other
way
when
they
were
walking
with
nice
girls
and
these
incidents
hurt
her
feelings
when
they
occurred
she
went
home
and
cried
besides
the
jackson
street
clerk
there
had
been
two
other
men
of
whom
the
first
was
a
naval
officer
who
passed
through
town
during
the
early
days
of
the
war
he
had
stayed
over
a
night
to
make
a
connection
and
was
leaning
idly
against
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
stonewall
hotel
when
she
passed
by
he
remained
in
town
four
days
she
thought
she
loved
him
lavished
on
him
that
first
hysteria
of
passion
that
would
have
gone
to
the
pusillanimous
clerk
the
naval
officer
uniform
there
were
few
of
them
in
those
days
had
made
the
magic
he
left
with
vague
promises
on
his
lips
and
once
on
the
train
rejoiced
that
he
had
not
told
her
his
real
name
her
resultant
depression
had
thrown
her
into
the
arms
of
cyrus
fielding
the
son
of
a
local
clothier
who
had
hailed
her
from
his
roadster
one
day
as
she
passed
along
the
sidewalk
she
had
always
known
him
by
name
had
she
been
born
to
a
higher
stratum
he
would
have
known
her
before
she
had
descended
a
little
lower
so
he
met
her
after
all
after
a
month
he
had
gone
away
to
a
little
afraid
of
the
intimacy
a
little
relieved
in
perceiving
that
she
had
not
cared
deeply
for
him
and
that
she
was
not
the
sort
who
would
ever
make
trouble
dot
romanticized
this
affair
and
conceded
to
her
vanity
that
the
war
had
taken
these
men
away
from
her
she
told
herself
that
she
could
have
married
the
naval
officer
nevertheless
it
worried
her
that
within
eight
months
there
had
been
three
men
in
her
life
she
thought
with
more
fear
than
wonder
in
her
heart
that
she
would
soon
be
like
those
bad
girls
on
jackson
street
at
whom
she
and
her
giggling
friends
had
stared
with
fascinated
glances
three
years
before
for
a
while
she
attempted
to
be
more
careful
she
let
men
pick
her
up
she
let
them
kiss
her
and
even
allowed
certain
other
liberties
to
be
forced
upon
her
but
she
did
not
add
to
her
trio
after
several
months
the
strength
of
her
resolution
or
rather
the
poignant
expediency
of
her
fears
was
worn
away
she
grew
restless
drowsing
there
out
of
life
and
time
while
the
summer
months
faded
the
soldiers
she
met
were
either
obviously
below
her
or
less
obviously
above
her
in
which
case
they
desired
only
to
use
her
they
were
yankees
harsh
and
ungracious
they
swarmed
in
large
crowds
and
then
she
met
anthony
on
that
first
evening
he
had
been
little
more
than
a
pleasantly
unhappy
face
a
voice
the
means
with
which
to
pass
an
hour
but
when
she
kept
her
engagement
with
him
on
saturday
she
regarded
him
with
consideration
she
liked
him
unknowingly
she
saw
her
own
tragedies
mirrored
in
his
face
again
they
went
to
the
movies
again
they
wandered
along
the
shadowy
scented
streets
hand
in
hand
this
time
speaking
a
little
in
hushed
voices
they
passed
through
the
gate
up
toward
the
little
porch
i
can
stay
a
while
ca
i
sh
she
whispered
we
got
to
be
very
quiet
mother
sits
up
reading
snappy
stories
in
confirmation
he
heard
the
faint
crackling
inside
as
a
page
was
turned
the
slits
emitted
horizontal
rods
of
light
that
fell
in
thin
parallels
across
dorothy
skirt
the
street
was
silent
save
for
a
group
on
the
steps
of
a
house
across
the
way
who
from
time
to
time
raised
their
voices
in
a
soft
bantering
you
you
shall
all
the
pretty
little
then
as
though
it
had
been
waiting
on
a
roof
for
their
arrival
the
moon
came
slanting
suddenly
through
the
vines
and
turned
the
face
to
the
color
of
white
roses
anthony
had
a
start
of
memory
so
vivid
that
before
his
closed
eyes
there
formed
a
picture
distinct
as
a
flashback
on
a
screen
a
spring
night
of
thaw
set
out
of
time
in
a
winter
five
years
before
another
face
radiant
upturned
to
lights
as
transforming
as
the
stars
ah
belle
dame
sans
who
lived
in
his
heart
made
known
to
him
in
transitory
fading
splendor
by
dark
eyes
in
the
by
a
shadowy
glance
from
a
passing
carriage
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
but
those
nights
were
only
part
of
a
song
a
remembered
glory
here
again
were
the
faint
winds
the
illusions
the
eternal
present
with
its
promise
of
romance
oh
she
whispered
do
you
love
me
do
you
love
me
the
spell
was
broken
the
drifted
fragments
of
the
stars
became
only
light
the
singing
down
the
street
diminished
to
a
monotone
to
the
whimper
of
locusts
in
the
grass
with
almost
a
sigh
he
kissed
her
fervent
mouth
while
her
arms
crept
up
about
his
shoulders
the
as
the
weeks
dried
up
and
blew
away
the
range
of
anthony
travels
extended
until
he
grew
to
comprehend
the
camp
and
its
environment
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
in
constant
personal
contact
with
the
waiters
to
whom
he
had
given
tips
the
chauffeurs
who
had
touched
their
hats
to
him
the
carpenters
plumbers
barbers
and
farmers
who
had
previously
been
remarkable
only
in
the
subservience
of
their
professional
genuflections
during
his
first
two
months
in
camp
he
did
not
hold
ten
minutes
consecutive
conversation
with
a
single
man
on
the
service
record
his
occupation
stood
as
student
on
the
original
questionnaire
he
had
prematurely
written
author
but
when
men
in
his
company
asked
his
business
he
commonly
gave
it
as
bank
clerk
had
he
told
the
truth
that
he
did
no
work
they
would
have
been
suspicious
of
him
as
a
member
of
the
leisure
class
his
platoon
sergeant
pop
donnelly
was
a
scraggly
old
soldier
worn
thin
with
drink
in
the
past
he
had
spent
unnumbered
weeks
in
the
but
recently
thanks
to
the
famine
he
had
been
elevated
to
his
present
pinnacle
his
complexion
was
full
of
it
bore
an
unmistakable
resemblance
to
those
aerial
photographs
of
the
at
blank
once
a
week
he
got
drunk
on
white
liquor
returned
quietly
to
camp
and
collapsed
upon
his
bunk
joining
the
company
at
reveille
looking
more
than
ever
like
a
white
mask
of
death
he
nursed
the
astounding
delusion
that
he
was
astutely
slipping
it
over
on
the
government
he
had
spent
eighteen
years
in
its
service
at
a
minute
wage
and
he
was
soon
to
retire
here
he
usually
winked
on
the
impressive
income
of
dollars
a
month
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
gorgeous
joke
that
he
had
played
upon
the
dozens
who
had
bullied
and
scorned
him
since
he
was
a
georgia
country
boy
of
nineteen
at
present
there
were
but
two
lieutenants
hopkins
and
the
popular
kretching
the
latter
was
considered
a
good
fellow
and
a
fine
leader
until
a
year
later
when
he
disappeared
with
a
mess
fund
of
eleven
hundred
dollars
and
like
so
many
leaders
proved
exceedingly
difficult
to
follow
eventually
there
was
captain
dunning
god
of
this
brief
but
microcosm
he
was
a
reserve
officer
nervous
energetic
and
enthusiastic
this
latter
quality
indeed
often
took
material
form
and
was
visible
as
fine
froth
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth
like
most
executives
he
saw
his
charges
strictly
from
the
front
and
to
his
hopeful
eyes
his
command
seemed
just
such
an
excellent
unit
as
such
an
excellent
war
deserved
for
all
his
anxiety
and
absorption
he
was
having
the
time
of
his
life
baptiste
the
little
sicilian
of
the
train
fell
foul
of
him
the
second
week
of
drill
the
captain
had
several
times
ordered
the
men
to
be
when
they
fell
in
each
morning
one
day
there
was
disclosed
an
alarming
breech
of
this
rule
surely
a
case
of
teutonic
connivance
during
the
night
four
men
had
grown
hair
upon
their
faces
the
fact
that
three
of
the
four
understood
a
minimum
of
english
made
a
practical
only
the
more
necessary
so
captain
dunning
resolutely
sent
a
volunteer
barber
back
to
the
company
street
for
a
razor
whereupon
for
the
safety
of
democracy
a
of
hair
was
scraped
dry
from
the
cheeks
of
three
italians
and
one
pole
outside
the
world
of
the
company
there
appeared
from
time
to
time
the
colonel
a
heavy
man
with
snarling
teeth
who
circumnavigated
the
battalion
upon
a
handsome
black
horse
he
was
a
west
pointer
and
mimetically
a
gentleman
he
had
a
dowdy
wife
and
a
dowdy
mind
and
spent
much
of
his
time
in
town
taking
advantage
of
the
lately
exalted
social
position
last
of
all
was
the
general
who
traversed
the
roads
of
the
camp
preceded
by
his
flag
a
figure
so
austere
so
removed
so
magnificent
as
to
be
scarcely
comprehensible
december
cool
winds
at
night
now
and
damp
chilly
mornings
on
the
as
the
heat
faded
anthony
found
himself
increasingly
glad
to
be
alive
renewed
strangely
through
his
body
he
worried
little
and
existed
in
the
present
with
a
sort
of
animal
content
it
was
not
that
gloria
or
the
life
that
gloria
represented
was
less
often
in
his
thoughts
it
was
simply
that
she
became
day
by
day
less
real
less
vivid
for
a
week
they
had
corresponded
passionately
almost
hysterically
then
by
an
unwritten
agreement
they
had
ceased
to
write
more
than
twice
and
then
once
a
week
she
was
bored
she
said
if
his
brigade
was
to
be
there
a
long
time
she
was
coming
down
to
join
him
haight
was
going
to
be
able
to
submit
a
stronger
brief
than
he
had
expected
but
doubted
that
the
appealed
case
would
come
up
until
late
spring
muriel
was
in
the
city
doing
red
cross
work
and
they
went
out
together
rather
often
what
would
anthony
think
if
went
into
the
red
cross
trouble
was
she
had
heard
that
she
might
have
to
bathe
negroes
in
alcohol
and
after
that
she
had
felt
so
patriotic
the
city
was
full
of
soldiers
and
she
seen
a
lot
of
boys
she
had
laid
eyes
on
for
years
anthony
did
not
want
her
to
come
south
he
told
himself
that
this
was
for
many
reasons
he
needed
a
rest
from
her
and
she
from
him
she
would
be
bored
beyond
measure
in
town
and
she
would
be
able
to
see
anthony
for
only
a
few
hours
each
day
but
in
his
heart
he
feared
that
it
was
because
he
was
attracted
to
dorothy
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
lived
in
terror
that
gloria
should
learn
by
some
chance
or
intention
of
the
relation
he
had
formed
by
the
end
of
a
fortnight
the
entanglement
began
to
give
him
moments
of
misery
at
his
own
faithlessness
nevertheless
as
each
day
ended
he
was
unable
to
withstand
the
lure
that
would
draw
him
irresistibly
out
of
his
tent
and
over
to
the
telephone
at
the
dot
yes
i
may
be
able
to
get
in
i
so
glad
do
you
want
to
listen
to
my
splendid
eloquence
for
a
few
starry
hours
oh
you
funny
for
an
instant
he
had
a
memory
of
five
years
before
of
geraldine
then
i
arrive
about
eight
at
seven
he
would
be
in
a
jitney
bound
for
the
city
where
hundreds
of
little
southern
girls
were
waiting
on
moonlit
porches
for
their
lovers
he
would
be
excited
already
for
her
warm
retarded
kisses
for
the
amazed
quietude
of
the
glances
she
gave
him
glances
nearer
to
worship
than
any
he
had
ever
inspired
gloria
and
he
had
been
equals
giving
without
thought
of
thanks
or
obligation
to
this
girl
his
very
caresses
were
an
inestimable
boon
crying
quietly
she
had
confessed
to
him
that
he
was
not
the
first
man
in
her
life
there
had
been
one
other
he
gathered
that
the
affair
had
no
sooner
commenced
than
it
had
been
over
indeed
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
she
spoke
the
truth
she
had
forgotten
the
clerk
the
naval
officer
the
clothier
son
forgotten
her
vividness
of
emotion
which
is
true
forgetting
she
knew
that
in
some
opaque
and
shadowy
existence
some
one
had
taken
her
it
was
as
though
it
had
occurred
in
sleep
almost
every
night
anthony
came
to
town
it
was
too
cool
now
for
the
porch
so
her
mother
surrendered
to
them
the
tiny
sitting
room
with
its
dozens
of
cheaply
framed
chromos
its
yard
upon
yard
of
decorative
fringe
and
its
thick
atmosphere
of
several
decades
in
the
proximity
of
the
kitchen
they
would
build
a
fire
then
happily
inexhaustibly
she
would
go
about
the
business
of
love
each
evening
at
ten
she
would
walk
with
him
to
the
door
her
black
hair
in
disarray
her
face
pale
without
cosmetics
paler
still
under
the
whiteness
of
the
moon
as
a
rule
it
would
be
bright
and
silver
outside
now
and
then
there
was
a
slow
warm
rain
too
indolent
almost
to
reach
the
ground
say
you
love
me
she
would
whisper
why
of
course
you
sweet
baby
am
i
a
baby
this
almost
wistfully
just
a
little
baby
she
knew
vaguely
of
gloria
it
gave
her
pain
to
think
of
it
so
she
imagined
her
to
be
haughty
and
proud
and
cold
she
had
decided
that
gloria
must
be
older
than
anthony
and
that
there
was
no
love
between
husband
and
wife
sometimes
she
let
herself
dream
that
after
the
war
anthony
would
get
a
divorce
and
they
would
be
married
but
she
never
mentioned
this
to
anthony
she
scarcely
knew
why
she
shared
his
company
idea
that
he
was
a
sort
of
bank
clerk
she
thought
that
he
was
respectable
and
poor
she
would
say
if
i
had
some
money
darlin
i
give
bit
of
it
to
you
like
to
have
about
fifty
thousand
dollars
i
suppose
that
be
plenty
agreed
anthony
in
her
letter
that
day
gloria
had
written
i
suppose
if
we
settle
for
a
million
it
would
be
better
to
tell
haight
to
go
ahead
and
settle
but
it
seem
a
pity
we
could
have
an
automobile
exclaimed
dot
in
a
final
burst
of
triumph
an
impressive
occasion
captain
dunning
prided
himself
on
being
a
great
reader
of
character
half
an
hour
after
meeting
a
man
he
was
accustomed
to
place
him
in
one
of
a
number
of
astonishing
categories
fine
man
good
man
smart
fellow
theorizer
poet
and
worthless
one
day
early
in
february
he
caused
anthony
to
be
summoned
to
his
presence
in
the
orderly
tent
patch
he
said
sententiously
i
had
my
eye
on
you
for
several
weeks
anthony
stood
erect
and
motionless
and
i
think
you
got
the
makings
of
a
good
soldier
he
waited
for
the
warm
glow
which
this
would
naturally
arouse
to
cool
and
then
continued
this
is
no
child
play
he
said
narrowing
his
brows
anthony
agreed
with
a
melancholy
no
sir
it
a
man
game
and
we
need
leaders
then
the
climax
swift
sure
and
electric
patch
i
going
to
make
you
a
corporal
at
this
point
anthony
should
have
staggered
slightly
backward
overwhelmed
he
was
to
be
one
of
the
quarter
million
selected
for
that
consummate
trust
he
was
going
to
be
able
to
shout
the
technical
phrase
follow
me
to
seven
other
frightened
men
you
seem
to
be
a
man
of
some
education
said
captain
dunning
yes
sir
that
good
that
good
education
a
great
thing
but
do
let
it
go
to
your
head
keep
on
the
way
you
doing
and
you
be
a
good
soldier
with
these
parting
words
lingering
in
his
ears
corporal
patch
saluted
executed
a
right
about
face
and
left
the
tent
though
the
conversation
amused
anthony
it
did
generate
the
idea
that
life
would
be
more
amusing
as
a
sergeant
or
should
he
find
a
less
exacting
medical
examiner
as
an
officer
he
was
little
interested
in
the
work
which
seemed
to
belie
the
army
boasted
gallantry
at
the
inspections
one
did
not
dress
up
to
look
well
one
dressed
up
to
keep
from
looking
badly
but
as
winter
wore
away
the
short
snowless
winter
marked
by
damp
nights
and
cool
rainy
days
he
marvelled
at
how
quickly
the
system
had
grasped
him
he
was
a
soldier
all
who
were
not
soldiers
were
civilians
the
world
was
divided
primarily
into
those
two
classifications
it
occurred
to
him
that
all
strongly
accentuated
classes
such
as
the
military
divided
men
into
two
kinds
their
own
kind
and
those
without
to
the
clergyman
there
were
clergy
and
laity
to
the
catholic
there
were
catholics
and
to
the
negro
there
were
blacks
and
whites
to
the
prisoner
there
were
the
imprisoned
and
the
free
and
to
the
sick
man
there
were
the
sick
and
the
well
so
without
thinking
of
it
once
in
his
lifetime
he
had
been
a
civilian
a
layman
a
a
gentile
white
free
and
well
as
the
american
troops
were
poured
into
the
french
and
british
trenches
he
began
to
find
the
names
of
many
harvard
men
among
the
casualties
recorded
in
the
army
and
navy
journal
but
for
all
the
sweat
and
blood
the
situation
appeared
unchanged
and
he
saw
no
prospect
of
the
ending
in
the
perceptible
future
in
the
old
chronicles
the
right
wing
of
one
army
always
defeated
the
left
wing
of
the
other
the
left
wing
being
meanwhile
vanquished
by
the
enemy
right
after
that
the
mercenaries
fled
it
had
been
so
simple
in
those
days
almost
as
if
prearranged
gloria
wrote
that
she
was
reading
a
great
deal
what
a
mess
they
had
made
of
their
affairs
she
said
she
had
so
little
to
do
now
that
she
spent
her
time
imagining
how
differently
things
might
have
turned
out
her
whole
environment
appeared
insecure
and
a
few
years
back
she
had
seemed
to
hold
all
the
strings
in
her
own
little
hand
in
june
her
letters
grew
hurried
and
less
frequent
she
suddenly
ceased
to
write
about
coming
south
defeat
march
in
the
country
around
was
rare
with
jasmine
and
jonquils
and
patches
of
violets
in
the
warming
grass
afterward
he
remembered
especially
one
afternoon
of
such
a
fresh
and
magic
glamour
that
as
he
stood
in
the
marking
targets
he
recited
atalanta
in
calydon
to
an
uncomprehending
pole
his
voice
mingling
with
the
rip
sing
and
splatter
of
the
bullets
overhead
when
the
hounds
of
spring
are
on
winter
traces
the
mother
of
months
hey
come
to
mark
in
town
the
streets
were
in
a
sleepy
dream
again
and
together
anthony
and
dot
idled
in
their
own
tracks
of
the
previous
autumn
until
he
began
to
feel
a
drowsy
attachment
for
this
south
a
south
it
seemed
more
of
algiers
than
of
italy
with
faded
aspirations
pointing
back
over
innumerable
generations
to
some
warm
primitive
nirvana
without
hope
or
care
here
there
was
an
inflection
of
cordiality
of
comprehension
in
every
voice
life
plays
the
same
lovely
and
agonizing
joke
on
all
of
us
they
seemed
to
say
in
their
plaintive
pleasant
cadence
in
the
rising
inflection
terminating
on
an
unresolved
minor
he
liked
his
barber
shop
where
he
was
hi
corporal
to
a
pale
emaciated
young
man
who
shaved
him
and
pushed
a
cool
vibrating
machine
endlessly
over
his
insatiable
head
he
liked
johnston
gardens
where
they
danced
where
a
tragic
negro
made
yearning
aching
music
on
a
saxophone
until
the
garish
hall
became
an
enchanted
jungle
of
barbaric
rhythms
and
smoky
laughter
where
to
forget
the
uneventful
passage
of
time
upon
dorothy
soft
sighs
and
tender
whisperings
was
the
consummation
of
all
aspiration
of
all
content
there
was
an
undertone
of
sadness
in
her
character
a
conscious
evasion
of
all
except
the
pleasurable
minutiae
of
life
her
violet
eyes
would
remain
for
hours
apparently
insensate
as
thoughtless
and
reckless
she
basked
like
a
cat
in
the
sun
he
wondered
what
the
tired
spiritless
mother
thought
of
them
and
whether
in
her
moments
of
uttermost
cynicism
she
ever
guessed
at
their
relationship
on
sunday
afternoons
they
walked
along
the
countryside
resting
at
intervals
on
the
dry
moss
in
the
outskirts
of
a
wood
here
the
birds
had
gathered
and
the
clusters
of
violets
and
white
dogwood
here
the
hoar
trees
shone
crystalline
and
cool
oblivious
to
the
intoxicating
heat
that
waited
outside
here
he
would
talk
intermittently
in
a
sleepy
monologue
in
a
conversation
of
no
significance
of
no
replies
july
came
scorching
down
captain
dunning
was
ordered
to
detail
one
of
his
men
to
learn
blacksmithing
the
regiment
was
filling
up
to
war
strength
and
he
needed
most
of
his
veterans
for
so
he
selected
the
little
italian
baptiste
whom
he
could
most
easily
spare
little
baptiste
had
never
had
anything
to
do
with
horses
his
fear
made
matters
worse
he
reappeared
in
the
orderly
room
one
day
and
told
captain
dunning
that
he
wanted
to
die
if
he
could
be
relieved
the
horses
kicked
at
him
he
said
he
was
no
good
at
the
work
finally
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
besought
captain
dunning
in
a
mixture
of
broken
english
and
scriptural
italian
to
get
him
out
of
it
he
had
not
slept
for
three
days
monstrous
stallions
reared
and
cavorted
through
his
dreams
captain
dunning
reproved
the
company
clerk
who
had
burst
out
laughing
and
told
baptiste
he
would
do
what
he
could
but
when
he
thought
it
over
he
decided
that
he
could
spare
a
better
man
little
baptiste
went
from
bad
to
worse
the
horses
seemed
to
divine
his
fear
and
take
every
advantage
of
it
two
weeks
later
a
great
black
mare
crushed
his
skull
in
with
her
hoofs
while
he
was
trying
to
lead
her
from
her
stall
in
came
rumors
and
then
orders
that
concerned
a
change
of
camp
the
brigade
was
to
move
to
an
empty
cantonment
a
hundred
miles
farther
south
there
to
be
expanded
into
a
division
at
first
the
men
thought
they
were
departing
for
the
trenches
and
all
evening
little
groups
jabbered
in
the
company
street
shouting
to
each
other
in
swaggering
exclamations
we
are
when
the
truth
leaked
out
it
was
rejected
indignantly
as
a
blind
to
conceal
their
real
destination
they
revelled
in
their
own
importance
that
night
they
told
their
girls
in
town
that
they
were
going
to
get
the
germans
anthony
circulated
for
a
while
among
the
groups
then
stopping
a
jitney
rode
down
to
tell
dot
that
he
was
going
away
she
was
waiting
on
the
dark
veranda
in
a
cheap
white
dress
that
accentuated
the
youth
and
softness
of
her
face
oh
she
whispered
i
wanted
you
so
honey
all
this
day
i
have
something
to
tell
you
she
drew
him
down
beside
her
on
the
swinging
seat
not
noticing
his
ominous
tone
tell
me
we
leaving
next
week
her
arms
seeking
his
shoulders
remained
poised
upon
the
dark
air
her
chin
tipped
up
when
she
spoke
the
softness
was
gone
from
her
voice
leaving
for
france
no
less
luck
than
that
leaving
for
some
darn
camp
in
mississippi
she
shut
her
eyes
and
he
could
see
that
the
lids
were
trembling
dear
little
dot
life
is
so
damned
hard
she
was
crying
upon
his
shoulder
so
damned
hard
so
damned
hard
he
repeated
aimlessly
it
just
hurts
people
and
hurts
people
until
finally
it
hurts
them
so
that
they
be
hurt
ever
any
more
that
the
last
and
worst
thing
it
does
frantic
wild
with
anguish
she
strained
him
to
her
breast
oh
god
she
whispered
brokenly
you
ca
go
way
from
me
i
die
he
was
finding
it
impossible
to
pass
off
his
departure
as
a
common
impersonal
blow
he
was
too
near
to
her
to
do
more
than
repeat
poor
little
dot
poor
little
dot
and
then
what
she
demanded
wearily
what
do
you
mean
you
my
whole
life
that
all
i
die
for
you
right
now
if
you
said
so
i
get
a
knife
and
kill
myself
you
ca
leave
me
here
her
tone
frightened
him
these
things
happen
he
said
evenly
then
i
going
with
you
tears
were
streaming
down
her
checks
her
mouth
was
trembling
in
an
ecstasy
of
grief
and
fear
sweet
he
muttered
sentimentally
sweet
little
girl
do
you
see
we
just
be
putting
off
what
bound
to
happen
i
be
going
to
france
in
a
few
months
she
leaned
away
from
him
and
clinching
her
fists
lifted
her
face
toward
the
sky
i
want
to
die
she
said
as
if
moulding
each
word
carefully
in
her
heart
dot
he
whispered
uncomfortably
you
forget
things
are
sweeter
when
they
lost
i
know
because
once
i
wanted
something
and
got
it
it
was
the
only
thing
i
ever
wanted
badly
dot
and
when
i
got
it
it
turned
to
dust
in
my
hands
all
right
absorbed
in
himself
he
continued
i
often
thought
that
if
i
had
got
what
i
wanted
things
might
have
been
different
with
me
i
might
have
found
something
in
my
mind
and
enjoyed
putting
it
in
circulation
i
might
have
been
content
with
the
work
of
it
and
had
some
sweet
vanity
out
of
the
success
i
suppose
that
at
one
time
i
could
have
had
anything
i
wanted
within
reason
but
that
was
the
only
thing
i
ever
wanted
with
any
fervor
god
and
that
taught
me
you
ca
have
you
ca
have
anything
at
because
desire
just
cheats
you
it
like
a
sunbeam
skipping
here
and
there
about
a
room
it
stops
and
gilds
some
inconsequential
object
and
we
poor
fools
try
to
grasp
it
but
when
we
do
the
sunbeam
moves
on
to
something
else
and
you
got
the
inconsequential
part
but
the
glitter
that
made
you
want
it
is
gone
he
broke
off
uneasily
she
had
risen
and
was
standing
picking
little
leaves
from
a
dark
vine
dot
go
way
she
said
coldly
what
why
i
do
want
just
words
if
that
all
you
have
for
me
you
better
go
why
dot
what
death
to
me
is
just
a
lot
of
words
to
you
you
put
together
so
pretty
i
sorry
i
was
talking
about
you
dot
go
way
from
here
he
approached
her
with
arms
outstretched
but
she
held
him
away
you
do
want
me
to
go
with
you
she
said
evenly
maybe
you
going
to
meet
that
that
girl
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
say
wife
how
do
i
know
well
then
i
reckon
you
not
my
fellow
any
more
so
go
way
for
a
moment
while
conflicting
warnings
and
desires
prompted
anthony
it
seemed
one
of
those
rare
times
when
he
would
take
a
step
prompted
from
within
he
hesitated
then
a
wave
of
weariness
broke
against
him
it
was
too
late
everything
was
too
late
for
years
now
he
had
dreamed
the
world
away
basing
his
decisions
upon
emotions
unstable
as
water
the
little
girl
in
the
white
dress
dominated
him
as
she
approached
beauty
in
the
hard
symmetry
of
her
desire
the
fire
blazing
in
her
dark
and
injured
heart
seemed
to
glow
around
her
like
a
flame
with
some
profound
and
uncharted
pride
she
had
made
herself
remote
and
so
achieved
her
purpose
i
did
mean
to
seem
so
callous
dot
it
do
matter
the
fire
rolled
over
anthony
something
wrenched
at
his
bowels
and
he
stood
there
helpless
and
beaten
come
with
me
dot
little
loving
dot
oh
come
with
me
i
leave
you
now
with
a
sob
she
wound
her
arms
around
him
and
let
him
support
her
weight
while
the
moon
at
its
perennial
labor
of
covering
the
bad
complexion
of
the
world
showered
its
illicit
honey
over
the
drowsy
street
the
catastrophe
early
september
in
camp
boone
mississippi
the
darkness
alive
with
insects
beat
in
upon
the
beneath
the
shelter
of
which
anthony
was
trying
to
write
a
letter
an
intermittent
chatter
over
a
poker
game
was
going
on
in
the
next
tent
and
outside
a
man
was
strolling
up
the
company
street
singing
a
current
bit
of
doggerel
about
with
an
effort
anthony
hoisted
himself
to
his
elbow
and
pencil
in
hand
looked
down
at
his
blank
sheet
of
paper
then
omitting
any
heading
he
began
ca
imagine
what
the
matter
is
gloria
i
have
had
a
line
from
you
for
two
weeks
and
it
only
natural
to
be
worried
he
threw
this
away
with
a
disturbed
grunt
and
began
again
do
know
what
to
think
gloria
your
last
letter
short
cold
without
a
word
of
affection
or
even
a
decent
account
of
what
you
been
doing
came
two
weeks
ago
it
only
natural
that
i
should
wonder
if
your
love
for
me
is
absolutely
dead
it
seems
that
you
at
least
keep
me
from
worry
again
he
crumpled
the
page
and
tossed
it
angrily
through
a
tear
in
the
tent
wall
realizing
simultaneously
that
he
would
have
to
pick
it
up
in
the
morning
he
felt
disinclined
to
try
again
he
could
get
no
warmth
into
the
lines
only
a
persistent
jealousy
and
suspicion
since
midsummer
these
discrepancies
in
gloria
correspondence
had
grown
more
and
more
noticeable
at
first
he
had
scarcely
perceived
them
he
was
so
inured
to
the
perfunctory
dearest
and
darlings
scattered
through
her
letters
that
he
was
oblivious
to
their
presence
or
absence
but
in
this
last
fortnight
he
had
become
increasingly
aware
that
there
was
something
amiss
he
had
sent
her
a
saying
that
he
had
passed
his
examinations
for
an
officers
and
expected
to
leave
for
georgia
shortly
she
had
not
answered
he
had
wired
again
when
he
received
no
word
he
imagined
that
she
might
be
out
of
town
but
it
occurred
and
recurred
to
him
that
she
was
not
out
of
town
and
a
series
of
distraught
imaginings
began
to
plague
him
supposing
gloria
bored
and
restless
had
found
some
one
even
as
he
had
the
thought
terrified
him
with
its
possibility
it
was
chiefly
because
he
had
been
so
sure
of
her
personal
integrity
that
he
had
considered
her
so
sparingly
during
the
year
and
now
as
a
doubt
was
born
the
old
angers
the
rages
of
possession
swarmed
back
a
thousandfold
what
more
natural
than
that
she
should
be
in
love
again
he
remembered
the
gloria
who
promised
that
should
she
ever
want
anything
she
would
take
it
insisting
that
since
she
would
act
entirely
for
her
own
satisfaction
she
could
go
through
such
an
affair
unsmirched
it
was
only
the
effect
on
a
person
mind
that
counted
anyhow
she
said
and
her
reaction
would
be
the
masculine
one
of
satiation
and
faint
dislike
but
that
had
been
when
they
were
first
married
later
with
the
discovery
that
she
could
be
jealous
of
anthony
she
had
outwardly
at
least
changed
her
mind
there
were
no
other
men
in
the
world
for
her
this
he
had
known
only
too
surely
perceiving
that
a
certain
fastidiousness
would
restrain
her
he
had
grown
lax
in
preserving
the
completeness
of
her
love
which
after
all
was
the
keystone
of
the
entire
structure
meanwhile
all
through
the
summer
he
had
been
maintaining
dot
in
a
to
do
this
it
had
been
necessary
to
write
to
his
broker
for
money
dot
had
covered
her
journey
south
by
leaving
her
house
a
day
before
the
brigade
broke
camp
informing
her
mother
in
a
note
that
she
had
gone
to
new
york
on
the
evening
following
anthony
had
called
as
though
to
see
her
raycroft
was
in
a
state
of
collapse
and
there
was
a
policeman
in
the
parlor
a
questionnaire
had
ensued
from
which
anthony
had
extricated
himself
with
some
difficulty
in
september
with
his
suspicions
of
gloria
the
company
of
dot
had
become
tedious
then
almost
intolerable
he
was
nervous
and
irritable
from
lack
of
sleep
his
heart
was
sick
and
afraid
three
days
ago
he
had
gone
to
captain
dunning
and
asked
for
a
furlough
only
to
be
met
with
benignant
procrastination
the
division
was
starting
overseas
while
anthony
was
going
to
an
officers
what
furloughs
could
be
given
must
go
to
the
men
who
were
leaving
the
country
upon
this
refusal
anthony
had
started
to
the
telegraph
office
intending
to
wire
gloria
to
come
south
he
reached
the
door
and
receded
despairingly
seeing
the
utter
impracticability
of
such
a
move
then
he
had
spent
the
evening
quarrelling
irritably
with
dot
and
returned
to
camp
morose
and
angry
with
the
world
there
had
been
a
disagreeable
scene
in
the
midst
of
which
he
had
precipitately
departed
what
was
to
be
done
with
her
did
not
seem
to
concern
him
vitally
at
present
he
was
completely
absorbed
in
the
disheartening
silence
of
his
wife
the
flap
of
the
tent
made
a
sudden
triangle
back
upon
itself
and
a
dark
head
appeared
against
the
night
sergeant
patch
the
accent
was
italian
and
anthony
saw
by
the
belt
that
the
man
was
a
headquarters
orderly
want
me
lady
call
up
headquarters
ten
minutes
ago
say
she
have
speak
with
you
ver
important
anthony
swept
aside
the
and
stood
up
it
might
be
a
wire
from
gloria
telephoned
over
she
say
to
get
you
she
call
again
ten
all
right
thanks
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
in
a
moment
was
striding
beside
the
orderly
through
the
hot
almost
suffocating
darkness
over
in
the
headquarters
shack
he
saluted
a
dozing
officer
sit
down
and
wait
suggested
the
lieutenant
nonchalantly
girl
seemed
awful
anxious
to
speak
to
you
anthony
hopes
fell
away
thank
you
very
much
sir
and
as
the
phone
squeaked
on
the
he
knew
who
was
calling
this
is
dot
came
an
unsteady
voice
i
got
to
see
you
dot
i
told
you
i
could
get
down
for
several
days
i
got
to
see
you
it
important
it
too
late
he
said
coldly
it
ten
and
i
have
to
be
in
camp
at
eleven
all
right
there
was
so
much
wretchedness
compressed
into
the
two
words
that
anthony
felt
a
measure
of
compunction
what
the
matter
i
want
to
tell
you
oh
do
be
a
little
idiot
he
exclaimed
but
his
spirits
rose
what
luck
if
she
should
leave
town
this
very
night
what
a
burden
from
his
soul
but
he
said
you
ca
possibly
leave
before
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
the
officer
regarding
him
quizzically
then
startlingly
came
dot
next
words
i
do
mean
that
way
anthony
hand
clutched
the
receiver
fiercely
he
felt
his
nerves
turning
cold
as
if
the
heat
was
leaving
his
body
what
then
quickly
in
a
wild
broken
voice
he
heard
oh
she
had
hung
up
the
receiver
with
a
sound
that
was
half
a
gasp
half
a
cry
anthony
hurried
from
the
headquarters
building
outside
under
the
stars
that
dripped
like
silver
tassels
through
the
trees
of
the
little
grove
he
stood
motionless
hesitating
had
she
meant
to
kill
herself
oh
the
little
fool
he
was
filled
with
bitter
hate
toward
her
in
this
dénouement
he
found
it
impossible
to
realize
that
he
had
ever
begun
such
an
entanglement
such
a
mess
a
sordid
mélange
of
worry
and
pain
he
found
himself
walking
slowly
away
repeating
over
and
over
that
it
was
futile
to
worry
he
had
best
go
back
to
his
tent
and
sleep
he
needed
sleep
god
would
he
ever
sleep
again
his
mind
was
in
a
vast
clamor
and
confusion
as
he
reached
the
road
he
turned
around
in
a
panic
and
began
running
not
toward
his
company
but
away
from
it
men
were
returning
now
he
could
find
a
taxicab
after
a
minute
two
yellow
eyes
appeared
around
a
bend
desperately
he
ran
toward
them
jitney
jitney
it
was
an
empty
ford
i
want
to
go
to
town
cost
you
a
dollar
all
right
if
you
just
hurry
after
an
interminable
time
he
ran
up
the
steps
of
a
dark
ramshackle
little
house
and
through
the
door
almost
knocking
over
an
immense
negress
who
was
walking
candle
in
hand
along
the
hall
where
my
wife
he
cried
wildly
she
gone
to
bed
up
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
down
the
creaking
passage
the
room
was
dark
and
silent
and
with
trembling
fingers
he
struck
a
match
two
wide
eyes
looked
up
at
him
from
a
wretched
ball
of
clothes
on
the
bed
ah
i
knew
you
come
she
murmured
brokenly
anthony
grew
cold
with
anger
so
it
was
just
a
plan
to
get
me
down
here
get
me
in
trouble
he
said
god
damn
it
you
shouted
once
too
often
she
regarded
him
pitifully
i
had
to
see
you
i
could
have
lived
oh
i
had
to
see
you
he
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
slowly
shook
his
head
you
no
good
he
said
decisively
talking
unconsciously
as
gloria
might
have
talked
to
him
this
sort
of
thing
is
fair
to
me
you
know
come
closer
whatever
he
might
say
dot
was
happy
now
he
cared
for
her
she
had
brought
him
to
her
side
oh
god
said
anthony
hopelessly
as
weariness
rolled
along
its
inevitable
wave
his
anger
subsided
receded
vanished
he
collapsed
suddenly
fell
sobbing
beside
her
on
the
bed
oh
my
darling
she
begged
him
do
cry
oh
do
cry
she
took
his
head
upon
her
breast
and
soothed
him
mingled
her
happy
tears
with
the
bitterness
of
his
her
hand
played
gently
with
his
dark
hair
i
such
a
little
fool
she
murmured
brokenly
but
i
love
you
and
when
you
cold
to
me
it
seems
as
if
it
is
worth
while
to
go
on
livin
after
all
this
was
peace
the
quiet
room
with
the
mingled
scent
of
women
powder
and
perfume
dot
hand
soft
as
a
warm
wind
upon
his
hair
the
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
as
she
took
breath
for
a
moment
it
was
as
though
it
were
gloria
there
as
though
he
were
at
rest
in
some
sweeter
and
safer
home
than
he
had
ever
known
an
hour
passed
a
clock
began
to
chime
in
the
hall
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
looked
at
the
phosphorescent
hands
of
his
wrist
watch
it
was
twelve
he
had
trouble
in
finding
a
taxi
that
would
take
him
out
at
that
hour
as
he
urged
the
driver
faster
along
the
road
he
speculated
on
the
best
method
of
entering
camp
he
had
been
late
several
times
recently
and
he
knew
that
were
he
caught
again
his
name
would
probably
be
stricken
from
the
list
of
officer
candidates
he
wondered
if
he
had
not
better
dismiss
the
taxi
and
take
a
chance
on
passing
the
sentry
in
the
dark
still
officers
often
rode
past
the
sentries
after
midnight
halt
the
monosyllable
came
from
the
yellow
glare
that
the
headlights
dropped
upon
the
changing
road
the
threw
out
his
clutch
and
a
sentry
walked
up
carrying
his
rifle
at
the
port
with
him
by
an
ill
chance
was
the
officer
of
the
guard
out
late
sergeant
yes
sir
got
delayed
too
bad
have
to
take
your
name
as
the
officer
waited
and
pencil
in
hand
something
not
fully
intended
crowded
to
anthony
lips
something
born
of
panic
of
muddle
of
despair
sergeant
foley
he
answered
breathlessly
and
the
outfit
company
q
infantry
all
right
you
have
to
walk
from
here
sergeant
anthony
saluted
quickly
paid
his
and
set
off
for
a
run
toward
the
regiment
he
had
named
when
he
was
out
of
sight
he
changed
his
course
and
with
his
heart
beating
wildly
hurried
to
his
company
feeling
that
he
had
made
a
fatal
error
of
judgment
two
days
later
the
officer
who
had
been
in
command
of
the
guard
recognized
him
in
a
barber
shop
in
charge
of
a
military
policeman
he
was
taken
back
to
the
camp
where
he
was
reduced
to
the
ranks
without
trial
and
confined
for
a
month
to
the
limits
of
his
company
street
with
this
blow
a
spell
of
utter
depression
overtook
him
and
within
a
week
he
was
again
caught
wandering
around
in
a
drunken
daze
with
a
pint
of
bootleg
whiskey
in
his
hip
pocket
it
was
because
of
a
sort
of
craziness
in
his
behavior
at
the
trial
that
his
sentence
to
the
was
for
only
three
weeks
nightmare
early
in
his
confinement
the
conviction
took
root
in
him
that
he
was
going
mad
it
was
as
though
there
were
a
quantity
of
dark
yet
vivid
personalities
in
his
mind
some
of
them
familiar
some
of
them
strange
and
terrible
held
in
check
by
a
little
monitor
who
sat
aloft
somewhere
and
looked
on
the
thing
that
worried
him
was
that
the
monitor
was
sick
and
holding
out
with
difficulty
should
he
give
up
should
he
falter
for
a
moment
out
would
rush
these
intolerable
things
only
anthony
could
know
what
a
state
of
blackness
there
would
be
if
the
worst
of
him
could
roam
his
consciousness
unchecked
the
heat
of
the
day
had
changed
somehow
until
it
was
a
burnished
darkness
crushing
down
upon
a
devastated
land
over
his
head
the
blue
circles
of
ominous
uncharted
suns
of
unnumbered
centres
of
fire
revolved
interminably
before
his
eyes
as
though
he
were
lying
constantly
exposed
to
the
hot
light
and
in
a
state
of
feverish
coma
at
seven
in
the
morning
something
phantasmal
something
almost
absurdly
unreal
that
he
knew
was
his
mortal
body
went
out
with
seven
other
prisoners
and
two
guards
to
work
on
the
camp
roads
one
day
they
loaded
and
unloaded
quantities
of
gravel
spread
it
raked
it
the
next
day
they
worked
with
huge
barrels
of
tar
flooding
the
gravel
with
black
shining
pools
of
molten
heat
at
night
locked
up
in
the
he
would
lie
without
thought
without
courage
to
compass
thought
staring
at
the
irregular
beams
of
the
ceiling
overhead
until
about
three
when
he
would
slip
into
a
broken
troubled
sleep
during
the
work
hours
he
labored
with
uneasy
haste
attempting
as
the
day
bore
toward
the
sultry
mississippi
sunset
to
tire
himself
physically
so
that
in
the
evening
he
might
sleep
deeply
from
utter
exhaustion
then
one
afternoon
in
the
second
week
he
had
a
feeling
that
two
eyes
were
watching
him
from
a
place
a
few
feet
beyond
one
of
the
guards
this
aroused
him
to
a
sort
of
terror
he
turned
his
back
on
the
eyes
and
shovelled
feverishly
until
it
became
necessary
for
him
to
face
about
and
go
for
more
gravel
then
they
entered
his
vision
again
and
his
already
taut
nerves
tightened
up
to
the
the
eyes
were
leering
at
him
out
of
a
hot
silence
he
heard
his
name
called
in
a
tragic
voice
and
the
earth
tipped
absurdly
back
and
forth
to
a
babel
of
shouting
and
confusion
when
next
he
became
conscious
he
was
back
in
the
and
the
other
prisoners
were
throwing
him
curious
glances
the
eyes
returned
no
more
it
was
many
days
before
he
realized
that
the
voice
must
have
been
dot
that
she
had
called
out
to
him
and
made
some
sort
of
disturbance
he
decided
this
just
previous
to
the
expiration
of
his
sentence
when
the
cloud
that
oppressed
him
had
lifted
leaving
him
in
a
deep
dispirited
lethargy
as
the
conscious
mediator
the
monitor
who
kept
that
fearsome
ménage
of
horror
grew
stronger
anthony
became
physically
weaker
he
was
scarcely
able
to
get
through
the
two
days
of
toil
and
when
he
was
released
one
rainy
afternoon
and
returned
to
his
company
he
reached
his
tent
only
to
fall
into
a
heavy
doze
from
which
he
awoke
before
dawn
aching
and
unrefreshed
beside
his
cot
were
two
letters
that
had
been
awaiting
him
in
the
orderly
tent
for
some
time
the
first
was
from
gloria
it
was
short
and
cool
case
is
coming
to
trial
late
in
november
can
you
possibly
get
leave
tried
to
write
you
again
and
again
but
it
just
seems
to
make
things
worse
i
want
to
see
you
about
several
matters
but
you
know
that
you
have
once
prevented
me
from
coming
and
i
am
disinclined
to
try
again
in
view
of
a
number
of
things
it
seems
necessary
that
we
have
a
conference
i
very
glad
about
your
gloria
he
was
too
tired
to
try
to
understand
or
to
care
her
phrases
her
intentions
were
all
very
far
away
in
an
incomprehensible
past
at
the
second
letter
he
scarcely
glanced
it
was
from
dot
an
incoherent
scrawl
a
flood
of
protest
endearment
and
grief
after
a
page
he
let
it
slip
from
his
inert
hand
and
drowsed
back
into
a
nebulous
hinterland
of
his
own
at
he
awoke
with
a
high
fever
and
fainted
when
he
tried
to
leave
his
tent
at
noon
he
was
sent
to
the
base
hospital
with
influenza
he
was
aware
that
this
sickness
was
providential
it
saved
him
from
a
hysterical
relapse
and
he
recovered
in
time
to
entrain
on
a
damp
november
day
for
new
york
and
for
the
interminable
massacre
beyond
when
the
regiment
reached
camp
mills
long
island
anthony
single
idea
was
to
get
into
the
city
and
see
gloria
as
soon
as
possible
it
was
now
evident
that
an
armistice
would
be
signed
within
the
week
but
rumor
had
it
that
in
any
case
troops
would
continue
to
be
shipped
to
france
until
the
last
moment
anthony
was
appalled
at
the
notion
of
the
long
voyage
of
a
tedious
debarkation
at
a
french
port
and
of
being
kept
abroad
for
a
year
possibly
to
replace
the
troops
who
had
seen
actual
fighting
his
intention
had
been
to
obtain
a
furlough
but
camp
mills
proved
to
be
under
a
strict
influenza
quarantine
it
was
impossible
for
even
an
officer
to
leave
except
on
official
business
for
a
private
it
was
out
of
the
question
the
camp
itself
was
a
dreary
muddle
cold
and
filthy
with
the
accumulated
dirt
incident
to
the
passage
through
of
many
divisions
their
train
came
in
at
seven
one
night
and
they
waited
in
line
until
one
while
a
military
tangle
was
straightened
out
somewhere
ahead
officers
ran
up
and
down
ceaselessly
calling
orders
and
making
a
great
uproar
it
turned
out
that
the
trouble
was
due
to
the
colonel
who
was
in
a
righteous
temper
because
he
was
a
west
pointer
and
the
war
was
going
to
stop
before
he
could
get
overseas
had
the
militant
governments
realized
the
number
of
broken
hearts
among
the
older
west
pointers
during
that
week
they
would
indubitably
have
prolonged
the
slaughter
another
month
the
thing
was
pitiable
gazing
out
at
the
bleak
expanse
of
tents
extending
for
miles
over
a
trodden
welter
of
slush
and
snow
anthony
saw
the
impracticability
of
trudging
to
a
telephone
that
night
he
would
call
her
at
the
first
opportunity
in
the
morning
aroused
in
the
chill
and
bitter
dawn
he
stood
at
reveille
and
listened
to
a
passionate
harangue
from
captain
dunning
you
men
may
think
the
war
is
over
well
let
me
tell
you
it
is
those
fellows
are
going
to
sign
the
armistice
it
another
trick
and
we
be
crazy
to
let
anything
slacken
up
here
in
the
company
because
let
me
tell
you
we
going
to
sail
from
here
within
a
week
and
when
we
do
we
going
to
see
some
real
fighting
he
paused
that
they
might
get
the
full
effect
of
his
pronouncement
and
then
if
you
think
the
war
over
just
talk
to
any
one
who
been
in
it
and
see
if
think
the
germans
are
all
in
they
do
nobody
does
talked
to
the
people
that
and
they
say
there
be
anyways
a
year
longer
of
war
do
think
it
over
so
you
men
better
not
get
any
foolish
ideas
that
it
is
doubly
stressing
this
final
admonition
he
ordered
the
company
dismissed
at
noon
anthony
set
off
at
a
run
for
the
nearest
canteen
telephone
as
he
approached
what
corresponded
to
the
of
the
camp
he
noticed
that
many
other
soldiers
were
running
also
that
a
man
near
him
had
suddenly
leaped
into
the
air
and
clicked
his
heels
together
the
tendency
to
run
became
general
and
from
little
excited
groups
here
and
there
came
the
sounds
of
cheering
he
stopped
and
listened
over
the
cold
country
whistles
were
blowing
and
the
chimes
of
the
garden
city
churches
broke
suddenly
into
reverberatory
sound
anthony
began
to
run
again
the
cries
were
clear
and
distinct
now
as
they
rose
with
clouds
of
frosted
breath
into
the
chilly
air
germany
surrendered
germany
surrendered
the
false
armistice
that
evening
in
the
opaque
gloom
of
six
anthony
slipped
between
two
and
once
over
the
railroad
followed
the
track
along
to
garden
city
where
he
caught
an
electric
train
for
new
york
he
stood
some
chance
of
apprehension
he
knew
that
the
military
police
were
often
sent
through
the
cars
to
ask
for
passes
but
he
imagined
that
the
vigilance
would
be
relaxed
but
in
any
event
he
would
have
tried
to
slip
through
for
he
had
been
unable
to
locate
gloria
by
telephone
and
another
day
of
suspense
would
have
been
intolerable
after
inexplicable
stops
and
waits
that
reminded
him
of
the
night
he
had
left
new
york
over
a
year
before
they
drew
into
the
pennsylvania
station
and
he
followed
the
familiar
way
to
the
finding
it
grotesque
and
oddly
stimulating
to
give
his
own
address
broadway
was
a
riot
of
light
thronged
as
he
had
never
seen
it
with
a
carnival
crowd
which
swept
its
glittering
way
through
scraps
of
paper
piled
on
the
sidewalks
here
and
there
elevated
upon
benches
and
boxes
soldiers
addressed
the
heedless
mass
each
face
in
which
was
clear
cut
and
distinct
under
the
white
glare
overhead
anthony
picked
out
half
a
dozen
figures
a
drunken
sailor
tipped
backward
and
supported
by
two
other
gobs
was
waving
his
hat
and
emitting
a
wild
series
of
roars
a
wounded
soldier
crutch
in
hand
was
borne
along
in
an
eddy
on
the
shoulders
of
some
shrieking
civilians
a
girl
sat
and
meditative
on
top
of
a
parked
taxicab
here
surely
the
victory
had
come
in
time
the
climax
had
been
scheduled
with
the
uttermost
celestial
foresight
the
great
rich
nation
had
made
triumphant
war
suffered
enough
for
poignancy
but
not
enough
for
bitterness
hence
the
carnival
the
feasting
the
triumph
under
these
bright
lights
glittered
the
faces
of
peoples
whose
glory
had
long
since
passed
away
whose
very
civilizations
were
whose
ancestors
had
heard
the
news
of
victory
in
babylon
in
nineveh
in
bagdad
in
tyre
a
hundred
generations
before
men
whose
ancestors
had
seen
a
cortege
drift
with
its
wake
of
captives
down
the
avenues
of
imperial
rome
past
the
rialto
the
glittering
front
of
the
astor
the
jewelled
magnificence
of
times
square
a
gorgeous
alley
of
incandescence
ahead
then
was
it
years
later
he
was
paying
the
in
front
of
a
white
building
on
street
he
was
in
the
hall
ah
there
was
the
negro
boy
from
martinique
lazy
indolent
unchanged
is
patch
in
i
have
just
came
on
sah
the
man
announced
with
his
incongruous
british
accent
take
me
up
then
the
slow
drone
of
the
elevator
the
three
steps
to
the
door
which
swung
open
at
the
impetus
of
his
knock
gloria
his
voice
was
trembling
no
answer
a
faint
string
of
smoke
was
rising
from
a
a
number
of
vanity
fair
sat
astraddle
on
the
table
gloria
he
ran
into
the
bedroom
the
bath
she
was
not
there
a
negligée
of
blue
laid
out
upon
the
bed
diffused
a
faint
perfume
illusive
and
familiar
on
a
chair
were
a
pair
of
stockings
and
a
street
dress
an
open
powder
box
yawned
upon
the
bureau
she
must
just
have
gone
out
the
telephone
rang
abruptly
and
he
started
answered
it
with
all
the
sensations
of
an
impostor
hello

i
looking
for
her
myself

a
bit
taken
aback

the
armistice

did
think

up
sharply
and
rose
who
was
crawford
and
who
was
it
that
was
taking
her
to
the
ball
how
long
had
this
been
going
on
all
these
questions
asked
and
answered
themselves
a
dozen
times
a
dozen
ways
his
very
proximity
to
her
drove
him
half
frantic
in
a
frenzy
of
suspicion
he
rushed
here
and
there
about
the
apartment
hunting
for
some
sign
of
masculine
occupation
opening
the
bathroom
cupboard
searching
feverishly
through
the
bureau
drawers
then
he
found
something
that
made
him
stop
suddenly
and
sit
down
on
one
of
the
twin
beds
the
corners
of
his
mouth
drooping
as
though
he
were
about
to
weep
there
in
a
corner
of
her
drawer
tied
with
a
frail
blue
ribbon
were
all
the
letters
and
telegrams
he
had
written
her
during
the
year
past
he
was
suffused
with
happy
and
sentimental
shame
i
not
fit
to
touch
her
he
cried
aloud
to
the
four
walls
i
not
fit
to
touch
her
little
hand
nevertheless
he
went
out
to
look
for
her
in
the
astor
lobby
he
was
engulfed
immediately
in
a
crowd
so
thick
as
to
make
progress
almost
impossible
he
asked
the
direction
of
the
ballroom
from
half
a
dozen
people
before
he
could
get
a
sober
and
intelligible
answer
eventually
after
a
last
long
wait
he
checked
his
military
overcoat
in
the
hall
it
was
only
nine
but
the
dance
was
in
full
blast
the
panorama
was
incredible
women
women
everywhere
girls
gay
with
wine
singing
shrilly
above
the
clamor
of
the
dazzling
throng
girls
set
off
by
the
uniforms
of
a
dozen
nations
fat
females
collapsing
without
dignity
upon
the
floor
and
retaining
by
shouting
hurraw
for
the
allies
three
women
with
white
hair
dancing
hand
in
hand
around
a
sailor
who
revolved
in
a
dizzying
spin
upon
the
floor
clasping
to
his
heart
an
empty
bottle
of
champagne
breathlessly
anthony
scanned
the
dancers
scanned
the
muddled
lines
trailing
in
single
file
in
and
out
among
the
tables
scanned
the
kissing
coughing
laughing
drinking
parties
under
the
great
flags
which
leaned
in
glowing
color
over
the
pageantry
and
the
sound
then
he
saw
gloria
she
was
sitting
at
a
table
for
two
directly
across
the
room
her
dress
was
black
and
above
it
her
animated
face
tinted
with
the
most
glamourous
rose
made
he
thought
a
spot
of
poignant
beauty
on
the
room
his
heart
leaped
as
though
to
a
new
music
he
jostled
his
way
toward
her
and
called
her
name
just
as
the
gray
eyes
looked
up
and
found
him
for
that
instant
as
their
bodies
met
and
melted
the
world
the
revel
the
tumbling
whimper
of
the
music
faded
to
an
ecstatic
monotone
hushed
as
a
song
of
bees
oh
my
gloria
he
cried
her
kiss
was
a
cool
rill
flowing
from
her
heart
chapter
ii
a
matter
of
aesthetics
on
the
night
when
anthony
had
left
for
camp
hooker
one
year
before
all
that
was
left
of
the
beautiful
gloria
gilbert
her
shell
her
young
and
lovely
body
moved
up
the
broad
marble
steps
of
the
grand
central
station
with
the
rhythm
of
the
engine
beating
in
her
ears
like
a
dream
and
out
onto
vanderbilt
avenue
where
the
huge
bulk
of
the
biltmore
overhung
the
street
and
down
at
its
low
gleaming
entrance
sucked
in
the
of
gorgeously
dressed
girls
for
a
moment
she
paused
by
the
and
watched
them
wondering
that
but
a
few
years
before
she
had
been
of
their
number
ever
setting
out
for
a
radiant
somewhere
always
just
about
to
have
that
ultimate
passionate
adventure
for
which
the
girls
cloaks
were
delicate
and
beautifully
furred
for
which
their
cheeks
were
painted
and
their
hearts
higher
than
the
transitory
dome
of
pleasure
that
would
engulf
them
coiffure
cloak
and
all
it
was
growing
colder
and
the
men
passing
had
flipped
up
the
collars
of
their
overcoats
this
change
was
kind
to
her
it
would
have
been
kinder
still
had
everything
changed
weather
streets
and
people
and
had
she
been
whisked
away
to
wake
in
some
high
room
alone
and
statuesque
within
and
without
as
in
her
virginal
and
colorful
past
inside
the
taxicab
she
wept
impotent
tears
that
she
had
not
been
happy
with
anthony
for
over
a
year
mattered
little
recently
his
presence
had
been
no
more
than
what
it
would
awake
in
her
of
that
memorable
june
the
anthony
of
late
irritable
weak
and
poor
could
do
no
less
than
make
her
irritable
in
turn
and
bored
with
everything
except
the
fact
that
in
a
highly
imaginative
and
eloquent
youth
they
had
come
together
in
an
ecstatic
revel
of
emotion
because
of
this
mutually
vivid
memory
she
would
have
done
more
for
anthony
than
for
any
other
human
so
when
she
got
into
the
taxicab
she
wept
passionately
and
wanted
to
call
his
name
aloud
miserable
lonesome
as
a
forgotten
child
she
sat
in
the
quiet
apartment
and
wrote
him
a
letter
full
of
confused
sentiment
can
almost
look
down
the
tracks
and
see
you
going
but
without
you
dearest
dearest
i
ca
see
or
hear
or
feel
or
think
being
apart
whatever
has
happened
or
will
happen
to
us
is
like
begging
for
mercy
from
a
storm
anthony
it
like
growing
old
i
want
to
kiss
you
so
in
the
back
of
your
neck
where
your
old
black
hair
starts
because
i
love
you
and
whatever
we
do
or
say
to
each
other
or
have
done
or
have
said
you
got
to
feel
how
much
i
do
how
inanimate
i
am
when
gone
i
ca
even
hate
the
damnable
presence
of
people
those
people
in
the
station
who
have
any
right
to
live
i
ca
resent
them
even
though
they
dirtying
up
our
world
because
i
engrossed
in
wanting
you
you
hated
me
if
you
were
covered
with
sores
like
a
leper
if
you
ran
away
with
another
woman
or
starved
me
or
beat
me
how
absurd
this
sounds
i
still
want
you
i
still
love
you
know
late
i
have
all
the
windows
open
and
the
air
outside
is
just
as
soft
as
spring
yet
somehow
much
more
young
and
frail
than
spring
why
do
they
make
spring
a
young
girl
why
does
that
illusion
dance
and
yodel
its
way
for
three
months
through
the
world
preposterous
barrenness
spring
is
a
lean
old
plough
horse
with
its
ribs
showing
it
a
pile
of
refuse
in
a
field
parched
by
the
sun
and
the
rain
to
an
ominous
a
few
hours
you
wake
up
my
darling
and
you
be
miserable
and
disgusted
with
life
you
be
in
delaware
or
carolina
or
somewhere
and
so
unimportant
i
do
believe
there
any
one
alive
who
can
contemplate
themselves
as
an
impermanent
institution
as
a
luxury
or
an
unnecessary
evil
very
few
of
the
people
who
accentuate
the
futility
of
life
remark
the
futility
of
themselves
perhaps
they
think
that
in
proclaiming
the
evil
of
living
they
somehow
salvage
their
own
worth
from
the
ruin
but
they
do
even
you
and
i
still
i
can
see
you
there
blue
haze
about
the
trees
where
you
be
passing
too
beautiful
to
be
predominant
no
the
fallow
squares
of
earth
will
be
most
frequent
they
be
along
beside
the
track
like
dirty
coarse
brown
sheets
drying
in
the
sun
alive
mechanical
abominable
nature
slovenly
old
hag
has
been
sleeping
in
them
with
every
old
farmer
or
negro
or
immigrant
who
happened
to
covet
her
you
see
that
now
you
gone
i
written
a
letter
all
full
of
contempt
and
despair
and
that
just
means
that
i
love
you
anthony
with
all
there
is
to
love
with
in
gloria
when
she
had
addressed
the
letter
she
went
to
her
twin
bed
and
lay
down
upon
it
clasping
anthony
pillow
in
her
arms
as
though
by
sheer
force
of
emotion
she
could
metamorphize
it
into
his
warm
and
living
body
two
saw
her
staring
with
steady
persistent
grief
into
the
darkness
remembering
remembering
unmercifully
blaming
herself
for
a
hundred
fancied
unkindnesses
making
a
likeness
of
anthony
akin
to
some
martyred
and
transfigured
christ
for
a
time
she
thought
of
him
as
he
in
his
more
sentimental
moments
probably
thought
of
himself
at
five
she
was
still
awake
a
mysterious
grinding
noise
that
went
on
every
morning
across
the
areaway
told
her
the
hour
she
heard
an
alarm
clock
ring
and
saw
a
light
make
a
yellow
square
on
an
illusory
blank
wall
opposite
with
the
resolution
of
following
him
south
immediately
her
sorrow
grew
remote
and
unreal
and
moved
off
from
her
as
the
dark
moved
westward
she
fell
asleep
when
she
awoke
the
sight
of
the
empty
bed
beside
her
brought
a
renewal
of
misery
dispelled
shortly
however
by
the
inevitable
callousness
of
the
bright
morning
though
she
was
not
conscious
of
it
there
was
relief
in
eating
breakfast
without
anthony
tired
and
worried
face
opposite
her
now
that
she
was
alone
she
lost
all
desire
to
complain
about
the
food
she
would
change
her
breakfasts
she
thought
have
a
lemonade
and
a
tomato
sandwich
instead
of
the
sempiternal
bacon
and
eggs
and
toast
nevertheless
at
noon
when
she
had
called
up
several
of
her
acquaintances
including
the
martial
muriel
and
found
each
one
engaged
for
lunch
she
gave
way
to
a
quiet
pity
for
herself
and
her
loneliness
curled
on
the
bed
with
pencil
and
paper
she
wrote
anthony
another
letter
late
in
the
afternoon
arrived
a
special
delivery
mailed
from
some
small
new
jersey
town
and
the
familiarity
of
the
phrasing
the
almost
audible
undertone
of
worry
and
discontent
were
so
familiar
that
they
comforted
her
who
knew
perhaps
army
discipline
would
harden
anthony
and
accustom
him
to
the
idea
of
work
she
had
immutable
faith
that
the
war
would
be
over
before
he
was
called
upon
to
fight
and
meanwhile
the
suit
would
be
won
and
they
could
begin
again
this
time
on
a
different
basis
the
first
thing
different
would
be
that
she
would
have
a
child
it
was
unbearable
that
she
should
be
so
utterly
alone
it
was
a
week
before
she
could
stay
in
the
apartment
with
the
probability
of
remaining
there
seemed
little
in
the
city
that
was
amusing
muriel
had
been
shifted
to
a
hospital
in
new
jersey
from
which
she
took
a
metropolitan
holiday
only
every
other
week
and
with
this
defection
gloria
grew
to
realize
how
few
were
the
friends
she
had
made
in
all
these
years
of
new
york
the
men
she
knew
were
in
the
army
men
she
knew
she
had
conceded
vaguely
to
herself
that
all
the
men
who
had
ever
been
in
love
with
her
were
her
friends
each
one
of
them
had
at
a
certain
considerable
time
professed
to
value
her
favor
above
anything
in
life
but
now
where
were
they
at
least
two
were
dead
half
a
dozen
or
more
were
married
the
rest
scattered
from
france
to
the
philippines
she
wondered
whether
any
of
them
thought
of
her
and
how
often
and
in
what
respect
most
of
them
must
still
picture
the
little
girl
of
seventeen
or
so
the
adolescent
siren
of
nine
years
before
the
girls
too
were
gone
far
afield
she
had
never
been
popular
in
school
she
had
been
too
beautiful
too
lazy
not
sufficiently
conscious
of
being
a
farmover
girl
and
a
future
wife
and
mother
in
perpetual
capital
letters
and
girls
who
had
never
been
kissed
hinted
with
shocked
expressions
on
their
plain
but
not
particularly
wholesome
faces
that
gloria
had
then
these
girls
had
gone
east
or
west
or
south
married
and
become
people
prophesying
if
they
prophesied
about
gloria
that
she
would
come
to
a
bad
end
not
knowing
that
no
endings
were
bad
and
that
they
like
her
were
by
no
means
the
mistresses
of
their
destinies
gloria
told
over
to
herself
the
people
who
had
visited
them
in
the
gray
house
at
marietta
it
had
seemed
at
the
time
that
they
were
always
having
company
she
had
indulged
in
an
unspoken
conviction
that
each
guest
was
ever
afterward
slightly
indebted
to
her
they
owed
her
a
sort
of
moral
ten
dollars
apiece
and
should
she
ever
be
in
need
she
might
so
to
speak
borrow
from
them
this
visionary
currency
but
they
were
gone
scattered
like
chaff
mysteriously
and
subtly
vanished
in
essence
or
in
fact
by
christmas
gloria
conviction
that
she
should
join
anthony
had
returned
no
longer
as
a
sudden
emotion
but
as
a
recurrent
need
she
decided
to
write
him
word
of
her
coming
but
postponed
the
announcement
upon
the
advice
of
haight
who
expected
almost
weekly
that
the
case
was
coming
up
for
trial
one
day
early
in
january
as
she
was
walking
on
fifth
avenue
bright
now
with
uniforms
and
hung
with
the
flags
of
the
virtuous
nations
she
met
rachael
barnes
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
nearly
a
year
even
rachael
whom
she
had
grown
to
dislike
was
a
relief
from
ennui
and
together
they
went
to
the
ritz
for
tea
after
a
second
cocktail
they
became
enthusiastic
they
liked
each
other
they
talked
about
their
husbands
rachael
in
that
tone
of
public
vainglory
with
private
reservations
in
which
wives
are
wont
to
speak
rodman
abroad
in
the
quartermaster
corps
he
a
captain
he
was
bound
he
would
go
and
he
did
think
he
could
get
into
anything
else
anthony
in
the
infantry
the
words
in
their
relation
to
the
cocktail
gave
gloria
a
sort
of
glow
with
each
sip
she
approached
a
warm
and
comforting
patriotism
by
the
way
said
rachael
half
an
hour
later
as
they
were
leaving
ca
you
come
up
to
dinner
night
i
having
two
awfully
sweet
officers
who
are
just
going
overseas
i
think
we
ought
to
do
all
we
can
to
make
it
attractive
for
them
gloria
accepted
gladly
she
took
down
the
address
recognizing
by
its
number
a
fashionable
apartment
building
on
park
avenue
it
been
awfully
good
to
have
seen
you
rachael
it
been
wonderful
i
wanted
to
with
these
three
sentences
a
certain
night
in
marietta
two
summers
before
when
anthony
and
rachael
had
been
unnecessarily
attentive
to
each
other
was
forgiven
gloria
forgave
rachael
rachael
forgave
gloria
also
it
was
forgiven
that
rachael
had
been
witness
to
the
greatest
disaster
in
the
lives
of
and
anthony
patch
compromising
with
events
time
moves
along
the
wiles
of
captain
collins
the
two
officers
were
captains
of
the
popular
craft
machine
gunnery
at
dinner
they
referred
to
themselves
with
conscious
boredom
as
members
of
the
suicide
club
in
those
days
every
recondite
branch
of
the
service
referred
to
itself
as
the
suicide
club
one
of
the
captains
captain
gloria
observed
was
a
tall
horsy
man
of
thirty
with
a
pleasant
mustache
and
ugly
teeth
the
other
captain
collins
was
chubby
and
inclined
to
laugh
with
abandon
every
time
he
caught
gloria
eye
he
took
an
immediate
fancy
to
her
and
throughout
dinner
showered
her
with
inane
compliments
with
her
second
glass
of
champagne
gloria
decided
that
for
the
first
time
in
months
she
was
thoroughly
enjoying
herself
after
dinner
it
was
suggested
that
they
all
go
somewhere
and
dance
the
two
officers
supplied
themselves
with
bottles
of
liquor
from
sideboard
a
law
forbade
service
to
the
military
and
so
equipped
they
went
through
innumerable
fox
trots
in
several
glittering
caravanseries
along
broadway
faithfully
alternating
partners
while
gloria
became
more
and
more
uproarious
and
more
and
more
amusing
to
the
captain
who
seldom
bothered
to
remove
his
genial
smile
at
all
at
eleven
to
her
great
surprise
she
was
in
the
minority
for
staying
out
the
others
wanted
to
return
to
rachael
apartment
to
get
some
more
liquor
they
said
gloria
argued
persistently
that
captain
collins
flask
was
half
full
she
had
just
seen
it
then
catching
rachael
eye
she
received
an
unmistakable
wink
she
deduced
confusedly
that
her
hostess
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
officers
and
assented
to
being
bundled
into
a
taxicab
outside
captain
wolf
sat
on
the
left
with
rachael
on
his
knees
captain
collins
sat
in
the
middle
and
as
he
settled
himself
he
slipped
his
arm
about
gloria
shoulder
it
rested
there
lifelessly
for
a
moment
and
then
tightened
like
a
vise
he
leaned
over
her
you
awfully
pretty
he
whispered
thank
you
kindly
sir
she
was
neither
pleased
nor
annoyed
before
anthony
came
so
many
arms
had
done
likewise
that
it
had
become
little
more
than
a
gesture
sentimental
but
without
significance
up
in
rachael
long
front
room
a
low
fire
and
two
lamps
shaded
with
orange
silk
gave
all
the
light
so
that
the
corners
were
full
of
deep
and
somnolent
shadows
the
hostess
moving
about
in
a
gown
of
loose
chiffon
seemed
to
accentuate
the
already
sensuous
atmosphere
for
a
while
they
were
all
four
together
tasting
the
sandwiches
that
waited
on
the
tea
table
then
gloria
found
herself
alone
with
captain
collins
on
the
fireside
lounge
rachael
and
captain
wolf
had
withdrawn
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
where
they
were
conversing
in
subdued
voices
i
wish
you
were
married
said
collins
his
face
a
ludicrous
travesty
of
in
all
seriousness
why
she
held
out
her
glass
to
be
filled
with
a
do
drink
any
more
he
urged
her
frowning
why
not
you
be
nicer
if
you
did
gloria
caught
suddenly
the
intended
suggestion
of
the
remark
the
atmosphere
he
was
attempting
to
create
she
wanted
to
laugh
yet
she
realized
that
there
was
nothing
to
laugh
at
she
had
been
enjoying
the
evening
and
she
had
no
desire
to
go
home
at
the
same
time
it
hurt
her
pride
to
be
flirted
with
on
just
that
level
pour
me
another
drink
she
insisted
please
oh
do
be
ridiculous
she
cried
in
exasperation
very
well
he
yielded
with
ill
grace
then
his
arm
was
about
her
again
and
again
she
made
no
protest
but
when
his
pink
cheek
came
close
she
leaned
away
you
awfully
sweet
he
said
with
an
aimless
air
she
began
to
sing
softly
wishing
now
that
he
would
take
down
his
arm
suddenly
her
eye
fell
on
an
intimate
scene
across
the
room
rachael
and
captain
wolf
were
engrossed
in
a
long
kiss
gloria
shivered
slightly
she
knew
not
why
pink
face
approached
again
you
should
look
at
them
he
whispered
almost
immediately
his
other
arm
was
around
her
his
breath
was
on
her
cheek
again
absurdity
triumphed
over
disgust
and
her
laugh
was
a
weapon
that
needed
no
edge
of
words
oh
i
thought
you
were
a
sport
he
was
saying
what
a
sport
why
a
person
that
likes
to
to
enjoy
life
is
kissing
you
generally
considered
a
joyful
affair
they
were
interrupted
as
rachael
and
captain
wolf
appeared
suddenly
before
them
it
late
gloria
said
rachael
she
was
flushed
and
her
hair
was
dishevelled
you
better
stay
here
all
night
for
an
instant
gloria
thought
the
officers
were
being
dismissed
then
she
understood
and
understanding
got
to
her
feet
as
casually
as
she
was
able
uncomprehendingly
rachael
continued
you
can
have
the
room
just
off
this
one
i
can
lend
you
everything
you
need
collins
eyes
implored
her
like
a
dog
captain
wolf
arm
had
settled
familiarly
around
rachael
waist
they
were
waiting
but
the
lure
of
promiscuity
colorful
various
labyrinthine
and
ever
a
little
odorous
and
stale
had
no
call
or
promise
for
gloria
had
she
so
desired
she
would
have
remained
without
hesitation
without
regret
as
it
was
she
could
face
coolly
the
six
hostile
and
offended
eyes
that
followed
her
out
into
the
hall
with
forced
politeness
and
hollow
words
was
even
sport
enough
to
try
to
take
me
home
she
thought
in
the
taxi
and
then
with
a
quick
surge
of
resentment
how
common
gallantry
in
february
she
had
an
experience
of
quite
a
different
sort
tudor
baird
an
ancient
flame
a
young
man
whom
at
one
time
she
had
fully
intended
to
marry
came
to
new
york
by
way
of
the
aviation
corps
and
called
upon
her
they
went
several
times
to
the
theatre
and
within
a
week
to
her
great
enjoyment
he
was
as
much
in
love
with
her
as
ever
quite
deliberately
she
brought
it
about
realizing
too
late
that
she
had
done
a
mischief
he
reached
the
point
of
sitting
with
her
in
miserable
silence
whenever
they
went
out
together
a
scroll
and
keys
man
at
yale
he
possessed
the
correct
reticences
of
a
good
egg
the
correct
notions
of
chivalry
and
and
of
course
but
unfortunately
the
correct
biases
and
the
correct
lack
of
ideas
all
those
traits
which
anthony
had
taught
her
to
despise
but
which
nevertheless
she
rather
admired
unlike
the
majority
of
his
type
she
found
that
he
was
not
a
bore
he
was
handsome
witty
in
a
light
way
and
when
she
was
with
him
she
felt
that
because
of
some
quality
he
possessed
call
it
stupidity
loyalty
sentimentality
or
something
not
quite
as
definite
as
any
of
the
three
he
would
have
done
anything
in
his
power
to
please
her
he
told
her
this
among
other
things
very
correctly
and
with
a
ponderous
manliness
that
masked
a
real
suffering
loving
him
not
at
all
she
grew
sorry
for
him
and
kissed
him
sentimentally
one
night
because
he
was
so
charming
a
relic
of
a
vanishing
generation
which
lived
a
priggish
and
graceful
illusion
and
was
being
replaced
by
less
gallant
fools
afterward
she
was
glad
she
had
kissed
him
for
next
day
when
his
plane
fell
fifteen
hundred
feet
at
mineola
a
piece
of
a
gasolene
engine
smashed
through
his
heart
gloria
alone
when
haight
told
her
that
the
trial
would
not
take
place
until
autumn
she
decided
that
without
telling
anthony
she
would
go
into
the
movies
when
he
saw
her
successful
both
histrionically
and
financially
when
he
saw
that
she
could
have
her
will
of
joseph
bloeckman
yielding
nothing
in
return
he
would
lose
his
silly
prejudices
she
lay
awake
half
one
night
planning
her
career
and
enjoying
her
successes
in
anticipation
and
the
next
morning
she
called
up
films
par
excellence
bloeckman
was
in
europe
but
the
idea
had
gripped
her
so
strongly
this
time
that
she
decided
to
go
the
rounds
of
the
moving
picture
employment
agencies
as
so
often
had
been
the
case
her
sense
of
smell
worked
against
her
good
intentions
the
employment
agency
smelt
as
though
it
had
been
dead
a
very
long
time
she
waited
five
minutes
inspecting
her
unprepossessing
competitors
then
she
walked
briskly
out
into
the
farthest
recesses
of
central
park
and
remained
so
long
that
she
caught
a
cold
she
was
trying
to
air
the
employment
agency
out
of
her
walking
suit
in
the
spring
she
began
to
gather
from
anthony
letters
not
from
any
one
in
particular
but
from
their
culminative
effect
that
he
did
not
want
her
to
come
south
curiously
repeated
excuses
that
seemed
to
haunt
him
by
their
very
insufficiency
occurred
with
freudian
regularity
he
set
them
down
in
each
letter
as
though
he
feared
he
had
forgotten
them
the
last
time
as
though
it
were
desperately
necessary
to
impress
her
with
them
and
the
dilutions
of
his
letters
with
affectionate
diminutives
began
to
be
mechanical
and
unspontaneous
almost
as
though
having
completed
the
letter
he
had
looked
it
over
and
literally
stuck
them
in
like
epigrams
in
an
oscar
wilde
play
she
jumped
to
the
solution
rejected
it
was
angry
and
depressed
by
turns
finally
she
shut
her
mind
to
it
proudly
and
allowed
an
increasing
coolness
to
creep
into
her
end
of
the
correspondence
of
late
she
had
found
a
good
deal
to
occupy
her
attention
several
aviators
whom
she
had
met
through
tudor
baird
came
into
new
york
to
see
her
and
two
other
ancient
beaux
turned
up
stationed
at
camp
dix
as
these
men
were
ordered
overseas
they
so
to
speak
handed
her
down
to
their
friends
but
after
another
rather
disagreeable
experience
with
a
potential
captain
collins
she
made
it
plain
that
when
any
one
was
introduced
to
her
he
should
be
under
no
misapprehensions
as
to
her
status
and
personal
intentions
when
summer
came
she
learned
like
anthony
to
watch
the
casualty
list
taking
a
sort
of
melancholy
pleasure
in
hearing
of
the
death
of
some
one
with
whom
she
had
once
danced
a
german
and
in
identifying
by
name
the
younger
brothers
of
former
suitors
thinking
as
the
drive
toward
paris
progressed
that
here
at
length
went
the
world
to
inevitable
and
destruction
she
was
her
birthday
fled
by
scarcely
noticed
years
before
it
had
frightened
her
when
she
became
twenty
to
some
extent
when
she
reached
but
now
she
looked
in
the
glass
with
calm
seeing
the
british
freshness
of
her
complexion
and
her
figure
boyish
and
slim
as
of
old
she
tried
not
to
think
of
anthony
it
was
as
though
she
were
writing
to
a
stranger
she
told
her
friends
that
he
had
been
made
a
corporal
and
was
annoyed
when
they
were
politely
unimpressed
one
night
she
wept
because
she
was
sorry
for
him
had
he
been
even
slightly
responsive
she
would
have
gone
to
him
without
hesitation
on
the
first
train
whatever
he
was
doing
he
needed
to
be
taken
care
of
spiritually
and
she
felt
that
now
she
would
be
able
to
do
even
that
recently
without
his
continual
drain
upon
her
moral
strength
she
found
herself
wonderfully
revived
before
he
left
she
had
been
inclined
through
sheer
association
to
brood
on
her
wasted
opportunities
now
she
returned
to
her
normal
state
of
mind
strong
disdainful
existing
each
day
for
each
day
worth
she
bought
a
doll
and
dressed
it
one
week
she
wept
over
ethan
frome
the
next
she
revelled
in
some
novels
of
galsworthy
whom
she
liked
for
his
power
of
recreating
by
spring
in
darkness
that
illusion
of
young
romantic
love
to
which
women
look
forever
forward
and
forever
back
in
october
anthony
letters
multiplied
became
almost
frantic
then
suddenly
ceased
for
a
worried
month
it
needed
all
her
powers
of
control
to
refrain
from
leaving
immediately
for
mississippi
then
a
telegram
told
her
that
he
had
been
in
the
hospital
and
that
she
could
expect
him
in
new
york
within
ten
days
like
a
figure
in
a
dream
he
came
back
into
her
life
across
the
ballroom
on
that
november
evening
and
all
through
long
hours
that
held
familiar
gladness
she
took
him
close
to
her
breast
nursing
an
illusion
of
happiness
and
security
she
had
not
thought
that
she
would
know
again
discomfiture
of
the
generals
after
a
week
anthony
regiment
went
back
to
the
mississippi
camp
to
be
discharged
the
officers
shut
themselves
up
in
the
compartments
on
the
pullman
cars
and
drank
the
whiskey
they
had
bought
in
new
york
and
in
the
coaches
the
soldiers
got
as
drunk
as
possible
also
and
pretended
whenever
the
train
stopped
at
a
village
that
they
were
just
returned
from
france
where
they
had
practically
put
an
end
to
the
german
army
as
they
all
wore
overseas
caps
and
claimed
that
they
had
not
had
time
to
have
their
gold
service
stripes
sewed
on
the
yokelry
of
the
seaboard
were
much
impressed
and
asked
them
how
they
liked
the
trenches
to
which
they
replied
oh
with
great
smacking
of
tongues
and
shaking
of
heads
some
one
took
a
piece
of
chalk
and
scrawled
on
the
side
of
the
train
we
won
the
war
now
we
going
home
and
the
officers
laughed
and
let
it
stay
they
were
all
getting
what
swagger
they
could
out
of
this
ignominious
return
as
they
rumbled
on
toward
camp
anthony
was
uneasy
lest
he
should
find
dot
awaiting
him
patiently
at
the
station
to
his
relief
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
of
her
and
thinking
that
were
she
still
in
town
she
would
certainly
attempt
to
communicate
with
him
he
concluded
that
she
had
gone
whither
he
neither
knew
nor
cared
he
wanted
only
to
return
to
gloria
gloria
reborn
and
wonderfully
alive
when
eventually
he
was
discharged
he
left
his
company
on
the
rear
of
a
great
truck
with
a
crowd
who
had
given
tolerant
almost
sentimental
cheers
for
their
officers
especially
for
captain
dunning
the
captain
on
his
part
had
addressed
them
with
tears
in
his
eyes
as
to
the
pleasure
and
the
work
and
time
not
wasted
and
duty
etc
it
was
very
dull
and
human
having
given
ear
to
it
anthony
whose
mind
was
freshened
by
his
week
in
new
york
renewed
his
deep
loathing
for
the
military
profession
and
all
it
connoted
in
their
childish
hearts
two
out
of
every
three
professional
officers
considered
that
wars
were
made
for
armies
and
not
armies
for
wars
he
rejoiced
to
see
general
and
riding
desolately
about
the
barren
camp
deprived
of
their
commands
he
rejoiced
to
hear
the
men
in
his
company
laugh
scornfully
at
the
inducements
tendered
them
to
remain
in
the
army
they
were
to
attend
schools
he
knew
what
these
schools
were
two
days
later
he
was
with
gloria
in
new
york
another
winter
late
one
february
afternoon
anthony
came
into
the
apartment
and
groping
through
the
little
hall
in
the
winter
dusk
found
gloria
sitting
by
the
window
she
turned
as
he
came
in
what
did
haight
have
to
say
she
asked
listlessly
nothing
he
answered
usual
thing
next
month
perhaps
she
looked
at
him
closely
her
ear
attuned
to
his
voice
caught
the
slightest
thickness
in
the
dissyllable
you
been
drinking
she
remarked
dispassionately
couple
glasses
oh
he
yawned
in
the
armchair
and
there
was
a
moment
silence
between
them
then
she
demanded
suddenly
did
you
go
to
haight
tell
me
the
truth
no
he
smiled
weakly
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
have
time
i
thought
you
did
go
he
sent
for
you
i
do
give
a
damn
i
sick
of
waiting
around
his
office
you
think
he
was
doing
a
favor
he
glanced
at
gloria
as
though
expecting
moral
support
but
she
had
turned
back
to
her
contemplation
of
the
dubious
and
unprepossessing
i
feel
rather
weary
of
life
he
offered
tentatively
still
she
was
silent
i
met
a
fellow
and
we
talked
in
the
biltmore
bar
the
dusk
had
suddenly
deepened
but
neither
of
them
made
any
move
to
turn
on
the
lights
lost
in
heaven
knew
what
contemplation
they
sat
there
until
a
flurry
of
snow
drew
a
languid
sigh
from
gloria
what
you
been
doing
he
asked
finding
the
silence
oppressive
reading
a
magazine
all
full
of
idiotic
articles
by
prosperous
authors
about
how
terrible
it
is
for
poor
people
to
buy
silk
shirts
and
while
i
was
reading
it
i
could
think
of
nothing
except
how
i
wanted
a
gray
squirrel
coat
and
how
we
ca
afford
one
yes
we
can
oh
no
oh
yes
if
you
want
a
fur
coat
you
can
have
one
her
voice
coming
through
the
dark
held
an
implication
of
scorn
you
mean
we
can
sell
another
bond
if
necessary
i
do
want
to
go
without
things
we
have
spent
a
lot
though
since
i
been
back
oh
shut
up
she
said
in
irritation
why
because
i
sick
and
tired
of
hearing
you
talk
about
what
we
spent
or
what
we
done
you
came
back
two
months
ago
and
we
been
on
some
sort
of
a
party
practically
every
night
since
we
both
wanted
to
go
out
and
we
gone
well
you
have
heard
me
complain
have
you
but
all
you
do
is
whine
whine
whine
i
do
care
any
more
what
we
do
or
what
becomes
of
us
and
at
least
i
consistent
but
i
will
tolerate
your
complaining
and
you
not
very
pleasant
yourself
sometimes
you
know
i
under
no
obligations
to
be
you
not
making
any
attempt
to
make
things
different
but
i
am
huh
seems
to
me
i
heard
that
before
this
morning
you
were
going
to
touch
another
thing
to
drink
until
you
gotten
a
position
and
you
did
even
have
the
spunk
to
go
to
haight
when
he
sent
for
you
about
the
suit
anthony
got
to
his
feet
and
switched
on
the
lights
see
here
he
cried
blinking
i
getting
sick
of
that
sharp
tongue
of
yours
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
do
you
think
particularly
happy
he
continued
ignoring
her
question
do
you
think
i
do
know
we
not
living
as
we
ought
to
in
an
instant
gloria
stood
trembling
beside
him
i
wo
it
she
burst
out
i
wo
be
lectured
to
you
and
your
suffering
you
just
a
pitiful
weakling
and
you
always
have
been
they
faced
one
another
idiotically
each
of
them
unable
to
impress
the
other
each
of
them
tremendously
achingly
bored
then
she
went
into
the
bedroom
and
shut
the
door
behind
her
his
return
had
brought
into
the
foreground
all
their
exasperations
prices
had
risen
alarmingly
and
in
perverse
ratio
their
income
had
shrunk
to
a
little
over
half
of
its
original
size
there
had
been
the
large
retainer
fee
to
haight
there
were
stocks
bought
at
one
hundred
now
down
to
thirty
and
forty
and
other
investments
that
were
not
paying
at
all
during
the
previous
spring
gloria
had
been
given
the
alternative
of
leaving
the
apartment
or
of
signing
a
year
lease
at
two
hundred
and
a
month
she
had
signed
it
inevitably
as
the
necessity
for
economy
had
increased
they
found
themselves
as
a
pair
quite
unable
to
save
the
old
policy
of
prevarication
was
resorted
to
weary
of
their
incapabilities
they
chattered
of
what
they
would
do
oh
of
how
they
would
stop
going
on
parties
and
of
how
anthony
would
go
to
work
but
when
dark
came
down
gloria
accustomed
to
an
engagement
every
night
would
feel
the
ancient
restlessness
creeping
over
her
she
would
stand
in
the
doorway
of
the
bedroom
chewing
furiously
at
her
fingers
and
sometimes
meeting
anthony
eyes
as
he
glanced
up
from
his
book
then
the
telephone
and
her
nerves
would
relax
she
would
answer
it
with
eagerness
some
one
was
coming
up
for
just
a
few
minutes
and
oh
the
weariness
of
pretense
the
appearance
of
the
wine
table
the
revival
of
their
jaded
spirits
and
the
awakening
like
the
of
a
sleepless
night
in
which
they
moved
as
the
winter
passed
with
the
march
of
the
returning
troops
along
fifth
avenue
they
became
more
and
more
aware
that
since
anthony
return
their
relations
had
entirely
changed
after
that
reflowering
of
tenderness
and
passion
each
of
them
had
returned
into
some
solitary
dream
unshared
by
the
other
and
what
endearments
passed
between
them
passed
it
seemed
from
empty
heart
to
empty
heart
echoing
hollowly
the
departure
of
what
they
knew
at
last
was
gone
anthony
had
again
made
the
rounds
of
the
metropolitan
newspapers
and
had
again
been
refused
encouragement
by
a
motley
of
office
boys
telephone
girls
and
city
editors
the
word
was
we
keeping
any
vacancies
open
for
our
own
men
who
are
still
in
france
then
late
in
march
his
eye
fell
on
an
advertisement
in
the
morning
paper
and
in
consequence
he
found
at
last
the
semblance
of
an
occupation
you
can
sell
not
earn
while
you
learn
salesmen
make
there
followed
an
address
on
madison
avenue
and
instructions
to
appear
at
one
that
afternoon
gloria
glancing
over
his
shoulder
after
one
of
their
usual
late
breakfasts
saw
him
regarding
it
idly
why
do
you
try
it
she
suggested
oh
it
one
of
these
crazy
schemes
it
might
not
be
at
least
it
be
experience
at
her
urging
he
went
at
one
to
the
appointed
address
where
he
found
himself
one
of
a
dense
miscellany
of
men
waiting
in
front
of
the
door
they
ranged
from
a
evidently
misusing
his
time
to
an
immemorial
individual
with
a
gnarled
body
and
a
gnarled
cane
some
of
the
men
were
seedy
with
sunken
cheeks
and
puffy
pink
eyes
others
were
young
possibly
still
in
high
school
after
a
jostled
fifteen
minutes
during
which
they
all
eyed
one
another
with
apathetic
suspicion
there
appeared
a
smart
young
shepherd
clad
in
a
suit
and
wearing
the
manner
of
an
assistant
rector
who
herded
them
into
a
large
room
which
resembled
a
and
contained
innumerable
desks
here
the
prospective
salesmen
sat
down
and
again
waited
after
an
interval
a
platform
at
the
end
of
the
hall
was
clouded
with
half
a
dozen
sober
but
sprightly
men
who
with
one
exception
took
seats
in
a
semicircle
facing
the
audience
the
exception
was
the
man
who
seemed
the
soberest
the
most
sprightly
and
the
youngest
of
the
lot
and
who
advanced
to
the
front
of
the
platform
the
audience
scrutinized
him
hopefully
he
was
rather
small
and
rather
pretty
with
the
commercial
rather
than
the
thespian
sort
of
prettiness
he
had
straight
blond
bushy
brows
and
eyes
that
were
almost
preposterously
honest
and
as
he
reached
the
edge
of
his
rostrum
he
seemed
to
throw
these
eyes
out
into
the
audience
simultaneously
extending
his
arm
with
two
fingers
outstretched
then
while
he
rocked
himself
to
a
state
of
balance
an
expectant
silence
settled
over
the
hall
with
perfect
assurance
the
young
man
had
taken
his
listeners
in
hand
and
his
words
when
they
came
were
steady
and
confident
and
of
the
school
of
straight
from
the
shoulder
men
he
began
and
paused
the
word
died
with
a
prolonged
echo
at
the
end
of
the
hall
the
faces
regarding
him
hopefully
cynically
wearily
were
alike
arrested
engrossed
six
hundred
eyes
were
turned
slightly
upward
with
an
even
graceless
flow
that
reminded
anthony
of
the
rolling
of
bowling
balls
he
launched
himself
into
the
sea
of
exposition
this
bright
and
sunny
morning
you
picked
up
your
favorite
newspaper
and
you
found
an
advertisement
which
made
the
plain
unadorned
statement
that
could
sell
that
was
all
it
said
it
did
say
it
did
say
it
did
say
it
just
made
one
single
solitary
assertion
that
and
and
business
of
pointing
could
sell
now
my
job
is
to
make
a
success
of
you
because
every
man
is
born
a
success
he
makes
himself
a
failure
it
not
to
teach
you
how
to
talk
because
each
man
is
a
natural
orator
and
only
makes
himself
a
clam
my
business
is
to
tell
you
one
thing
in
a
way
that
will
make
you
it
it
to
tell
you
that
and
and
have
the
heritage
of
money
and
prosperity
waiting
for
you
to
come
and
claim
it
at
this
point
an
irishman
of
saturnine
appearance
rose
from
his
desk
near
the
rear
of
the
hall
and
went
out
that
man
thinks
he
go
look
for
it
in
the
beer
parlor
around
the
corner
laughter
he
wo
find
it
there
once
upon
a
time
i
looked
for
it
there
myself
laughter
but
that
was
before
i
did
what
every
one
of
you
men
no
matter
how
young
or
how
old
how
poor
or
how
rich
a
faint
ripple
of
satirical
laughter
can
do
it
was
before
i
found
now
i
wonder
if
any
of
you
men
know
what
a
talk
is
a
talk
is
a
little
book
in
which
i
started
about
five
years
ago
to
write
down
what
i
had
discovered
were
the
principal
reasons
for
a
failure
and
the
principal
reasons
for
a
man
success
from
john
rockerfeller
back
to
john
napoleon
laughter
and
before
that
back
in
the
days
when
abel
sold
his
birthright
for
a
mess
of
pottage
there
are
now
one
hundred
of
these
talks
those
of
you
who
are
sincere
who
are
interested
in
our
proposition
above
all
who
are
dissatisfied
with
the
way
things
are
breaking
for
you
at
present
will
be
handed
one
to
take
home
with
you
as
you
go
out
yonder
door
this
afternoon
now
in
my
own
pocket
i
have
four
letters
just
received
concerning
talks
these
letters
have
names
signed
to
them
that
are
familiar
in
every
in
the
listen
to
this
one
from
detroit
dear
carleton
i
want
to
order
three
thousand
more
copies
of
talks
for
distribution
among
my
salesmen
they
have
done
more
for
getting
work
out
of
the
men
than
any
bonus
proposition
ever
considered
i
read
them
myself
constantly
and
i
desire
to
heartily
congratulate
you
on
getting
at
the
roots
of
the
biggest
problem
that
faces
our
generation
the
problem
of
salesmanship
the
rock
bottom
on
which
the
country
is
founded
is
the
problem
of
salesmanship
with
many
felicitations
i
am
yours
very
cordially
henry
w
terral
he
brought
the
name
out
in
three
long
booming
triumphancies
pausing
for
it
to
produce
its
magical
effect
then
he
read
two
more
letters
one
from
a
manufacturer
of
vacuum
cleaners
and
one
from
the
president
of
the
great
northern
doily
company
and
now
he
continued
i
going
to
tell
you
in
a
few
words
what
the
proposition
is
that
going
to
those
of
you
who
go
into
it
in
the
right
spirit
simply
put
it
this
talks
have
been
incorporated
as
a
company
we
going
to
put
these
little
pamphlets
into
the
hands
of
every
big
business
organization
every
salesman
and
every
man
who
i
do
say
i
say
that
he
can
sell
we
are
offering
some
of
the
stock
of
the
talks
concern
upon
the
market
and
in
order
that
the
distribution
may
be
as
wide
as
possible
and
in
order
also
that
we
can
furnish
a
living
concrete
example
of
what
salesmanship
is
or
rather
what
it
may
be
we
going
to
give
those
of
you
who
are
the
real
thing
a
chance
to
sell
that
stock
now
i
do
care
what
you
tried
to
sell
before
or
how
you
tried
to
sell
it
it
do
matter
how
old
you
are
or
how
young
you
are
i
only
want
to
know
two
things
first
do
you
success
and
second
will
you
work
for
it
my
name
is
sammy
carleton
not
carleton
but
just
plain
sammy
i
a
regular
man
with
no
fancy
frills
about
me
i
want
you
to
call
me
sammy
now
this
is
all
i
going
to
say
to
you
i
want
those
of
you
who
have
thought
it
over
and
have
read
the
copy
of
which
will
be
given
to
you
at
the
door
to
come
back
to
this
same
room
at
this
same
time
then
we
go
into
the
proposition
further
and
explain
to
you
what
i
found
the
principles
of
success
to
be
going
to
make
you
that
and
and
can
sell
carleton
voice
echoed
for
a
moment
through
the
hall
and
then
died
away
to
the
stamping
of
many
feet
anthony
was
pushed
and
jostled
with
the
crowd
out
of
the
room
further
adventures
with
heart
talks
with
an
accompaniment
of
ironic
laughter
anthony
told
gloria
the
story
of
his
commercial
adventure
but
she
listened
without
amusement
you
going
to
give
up
again
she
demanded
coldly
why
you
do
expect
me
to
i
never
expected
anything
of
you
he
hesitated
well
i
ca
see
the
slightest
benefit
in
laughing
myself
sick
over
this
sort
of
affair
if
there
anything
older
than
the
old
story
the
new
twist
it
required
an
astonishing
amount
of
moral
energy
on
gloria
part
to
intimidate
him
into
returning
and
when
he
reported
next
day
somewhat
depressed
from
his
perusal
of
the
senile
bromides
skittishly
set
forth
in
heart
talks
on
ambition
he
found
only
fifty
of
the
original
three
hundred
awaiting
the
appearance
of
the
vital
and
compelling
sammy
carleton
carleton
powers
of
vitality
and
compulsion
were
this
time
exercised
in
elucidating
that
magnificent
piece
of
speculation
how
to
sell
it
seemed
that
the
approved
method
was
to
state
proposition
and
then
to
say
not
and
now
will
you
buy
this
was
not
the
way
oh
no
the
way
was
to
state
one
proposition
and
then
having
reduced
one
adversary
to
a
state
of
exhaustion
to
deliver
oneself
of
the
categorical
imperative
now
see
here
you
taken
up
my
time
explaining
this
matter
to
you
you
admitted
my
points
all
i
want
to
ask
is
how
many
do
you
want
as
carleton
piled
assertion
upon
assertion
anthony
began
to
feel
a
sort
of
disgusted
confidence
in
him
the
man
appeared
to
know
what
he
was
talking
about
obviously
prosperous
he
had
risen
to
the
position
of
instructing
others
it
did
not
occur
to
anthony
that
the
type
of
man
who
attains
commercial
success
seldom
knows
how
or
why
and
as
in
his
grandfather
case
when
he
ascribes
reasons
the
reasons
are
generally
inaccurate
and
absurd
anthony
noted
that
of
the
numerous
old
men
who
had
answered
the
original
advertisement
only
two
had
returned
and
that
among
the
thirty
odd
who
assembled
on
the
third
day
to
get
actual
selling
instructions
from
carleton
only
one
gray
head
was
in
evidence
these
thirty
were
eager
converts
with
their
mouths
they
followed
the
working
of
mouth
they
swayed
in
their
seats
with
enthusiasm
and
in
the
intervals
of
his
talk
they
spoke
to
each
other
in
tense
approving
whispers
yet
of
the
chosen
few
who
in
the
words
of
carleton
were
determined
to
get
those
deserts
that
rightly
and
truly
belonged
to
them
less
than
half
a
dozen
combined
even
a
modicum
of
personal
appearance
with
that
great
gift
of
being
a
pusher
but
they
were
told
that
they
were
all
natural
pushers
it
was
merely
necessary
that
they
should
believe
with
a
sort
of
savage
passion
in
what
they
were
selling
he
even
urged
each
one
to
buy
some
stock
himself
if
possible
in
order
to
increase
his
own
sincerity
on
the
fifth
day
then
anthony
sallied
into
the
street
with
all
the
sensations
of
a
man
wanted
by
the
police
acting
according
to
instructions
he
selected
a
tall
office
building
in
order
that
he
might
ride
to
the
top
story
and
work
downward
stopping
in
every
office
that
had
a
name
on
the
door
but
at
the
last
minute
he
hesitated
perhaps
it
would
be
more
practicable
to
acclimate
himself
to
the
chilly
atmosphere
which
he
felt
was
awaiting
him
by
trying
a
few
offices
on
say
madison
avenue
he
went
into
an
arcade
that
seemed
only
and
seeing
a
sign
which
read
percy
weatherbee
architect
he
opened
the
door
heroically
and
entered
a
starchy
young
woman
looked
up
questioningly
can
i
see
mr
weatherbee
he
wondered
if
his
voice
sounded
tremulous
she
laid
her
hand
tentatively
on
the
what
the
name
please
he
would
ah
know
me
he
would
know
my
name
what
your
business
with
him
you
an
insurance
agent
oh
no
nothing
like
that
denied
anthony
hurriedly
oh
no
a
it
a
personal
matter
he
wondered
if
he
should
have
said
this
it
had
all
sounded
so
simple
when
carleton
had
enjoined
his
flock
do
allow
yourself
to
be
kept
out
show
them
you
made
up
your
mind
to
talk
to
them
and
they
listen
the
girl
succumbed
to
anthony
pleasant
melancholy
face
and
in
a
moment
the
door
to
the
inner
room
opened
and
admitted
a
tall
man
with
slicked
hair
he
approached
anthony
with
impatience
you
wanted
to
see
me
on
a
personal
matter
anthony
quailed
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
he
said
defiantly
about
what
it
take
some
time
to
explain
well
what
it
about
weatherbee
voice
indicated
rising
irritation
then
anthony
straining
at
each
word
each
syllable
began
i
do
know
whether
or
not
you
ever
heard
of
a
series
of
pamphlets
called
talks
good
grief
cried
percy
weatherbee
architect
are
you
trying
to
touch
my
heart
no
it
business
talks
have
been
incorporated
and
putting
some
shares
on
the
market
his
voice
faded
slowly
off
harassed
by
a
fixed
and
contemptuous
stare
from
his
unwilling
prey
for
another
minute
he
struggled
on
increasingly
sensitive
entangled
in
his
own
words
his
confidence
oozed
from
him
in
great
retching
emanations
that
seemed
to
be
sections
of
his
own
body
almost
mercifully
percy
weatherbee
architect
terminated
the
interview
good
grief
he
exploded
in
disgust
and
you
call
that
a
matter
he
whipped
about
and
strode
into
his
private
office
banging
the
door
behind
him
not
daring
to
look
at
the
stenographer
anthony
in
some
shameful
and
mysterious
way
got
himself
from
the
room
perspiring
profusely
he
stood
in
the
hall
wondering
why
they
did
come
and
arrest
him
in
every
hurried
look
he
discerned
infallibly
a
glance
of
scorn
after
an
hour
and
with
the
help
of
two
strong
whiskies
he
brought
himself
up
to
another
attempt
he
walked
into
a
plumber
shop
but
when
he
mentioned
his
business
the
plumber
began
pulling
on
his
coat
in
a
great
hurry
gruffly
announcing
that
he
had
to
go
to
lunch
anthony
remarked
politely
that
it
was
futile
to
try
to
sell
a
man
anything
when
he
was
hungry
and
the
plumber
heartily
agreed
this
episode
encouraged
anthony
he
tried
to
think
that
had
the
plumber
not
been
bound
for
lunch
he
would
at
least
have
listened
passing
by
a
few
glittering
and
formidable
bazaars
he
entered
a
grocery
store
a
talkative
proprietor
told
him
that
before
buying
any
stocks
he
was
going
to
see
how
the
armistice
affected
the
market
to
anthony
this
seemed
almost
unfair
in
carleton
salesman
utopia
the
only
reason
prospective
buyers
ever
gave
for
not
purchasing
stock
was
that
they
doubted
it
to
be
a
promising
investment
obviously
a
man
in
that
state
was
almost
ludicrously
easy
game
to
be
brought
down
merely
by
the
judicious
application
of
the
correct
selling
points
but
these
men
why
actually
they
were
considering
buying
anything
at
all
anthony
took
several
more
drinks
before
he
approached
his
fourth
man
a
agent
nevertheless
he
was
floored
with
a
coup
as
decisive
as
a
syllogism
the
agent
said
that
he
had
three
brothers
in
the
investment
business
viewing
himself
as
a
of
homes
anthony
apologized
and
went
out
after
another
drink
he
conceived
the
brilliant
plan
of
selling
the
stock
to
the
bartenders
along
lexington
avenue
this
occupied
several
hours
for
it
was
necessary
to
take
a
few
drinks
in
each
place
in
order
to
get
the
proprietor
in
the
proper
frame
of
mind
to
talk
business
but
the
bartenders
one
and
all
contended
that
if
they
had
any
money
to
buy
bonds
they
would
not
be
bartenders
it
was
as
though
they
had
all
convened
and
decided
upon
that
rejoinder
as
he
approached
a
dark
and
soggy
five
he
found
that
they
were
developing
a
still
more
annoying
tendency
to
turn
him
off
with
a
jest
at
five
then
with
a
tremendous
effort
at
concentration
he
decided
that
he
must
put
more
variety
into
his
canvassing
he
selected
a
delicatessen
store
and
went
in
he
felt
illuminatingly
that
the
thing
to
do
was
to
cast
a
spell
not
only
over
the
storekeeper
but
over
all
the
customers
as
well
and
perhaps
through
the
psychology
of
the
herd
instinct
they
would
buy
as
an
astounded
and
immediately
convinced
whole
he
began
in
a
loud
thick
voice
ga
if
he
had
wanted
silence
he
obtained
it
a
sort
of
awe
descended
upon
the
women
marketing
and
upon
the
ancient
who
in
cap
and
apron
was
slicing
chicken
anthony
pulled
a
batch
of
papers
from
his
flapping
briefcase
and
waved
them
cheerfully
buy
a
bon
he
suggested
good
as
liberty
bon
the
phrase
pleased
him
and
he
elaborated
upon
it
liberty
bon
every
one
these
bon
worth
liberty
bon
his
mind
made
a
hiatus
and
skipped
to
his
peroration
which
he
delivered
with
appropriate
gestures
these
being
somewhat
marred
by
the
necessity
of
clinging
to
the
counter
with
one
or
both
hands
now
see
here
you
taken
up
my
time
i
do
want
know
you
buy
i
just
want
you
say
want
you
say
many
at
this
point
they
should
have
approached
him
with
and
fountain
pens
in
hand
realizing
that
they
must
have
missed
a
cue
anthony
with
the
instincts
of
an
actor
went
back
and
repeated
his
finale
now
see
here
you
taken
up
my
time
you
followed
you
agreed
reasonin
now
all
i
want
from
is
how
many
bon
see
here
broke
in
a
new
voice
a
portly
man
whose
face
was
adorned
with
symmetrical
scrolls
of
yellow
hair
had
come
out
of
a
glass
cage
in
the
rear
of
the
store
and
was
bearing
down
upon
anthony
see
here
you
how
many
repeated
the
salesman
sternly
you
taken
up
my
time
hey
you
cried
the
proprietor
i
have
you
taken
up
by
the
police
you
mos
wo
returned
anthony
with
fine
defiance
all
i
want
know
is
how
many
from
here
and
there
in
the
store
went
up
little
clouds
of
comment
and
expostulation
how
terrible
he
a
raving
maniac
he
disgracefully
drunk
the
proprietor
grasped
anthony
arm
sharply
get
out
or
i
call
a
policeman
some
relics
of
rationality
moved
anthony
to
nod
and
replace
his
bonds
clumsily
in
the
case
how
many
he
reiterated
doubtfully
the
whole
force
if
necessary
thundered
his
adversary
his
yellow
mustache
trembling
fiercely
sell
all
a
bon
with
this
anthony
turned
bowed
gravely
to
his
late
auditors
and
wabbled
from
the
store
he
found
a
taxicab
at
the
corner
and
rode
home
to
the
apartment
there
he
fell
sound
asleep
on
the
sofa
and
so
gloria
found
him
his
breath
filling
the
air
with
an
unpleasant
pungency
his
hand
still
clutching
his
open
brief
case
except
when
anthony
was
drinking
his
range
of
sensation
had
become
less
than
that
of
a
healthy
old
man
and
when
prohibition
came
in
july
he
found
that
among
those
who
could
afford
it
there
was
more
drinking
than
ever
before
one
host
now
brought
out
a
bottle
upon
the
slightest
pretext
the
tendency
to
display
liquor
was
a
manifestation
of
the
same
instinct
that
led
a
man
to
deck
his
wife
with
jewels
to
have
liquor
was
a
boast
almost
a
badge
of
respectability
in
the
mornings
anthony
awoke
tired
nervous
and
worried
halcyon
summer
twilights
and
the
purple
chill
of
morning
alike
left
him
unresponsive
only
for
a
brief
moment
every
day
in
the
warmth
and
renewed
life
of
a
first
did
his
mind
turn
to
those
opalescent
dreams
of
future
pleasure
the
mutual
heritage
of
the
happy
and
the
damned
but
this
was
only
for
a
little
while
as
he
grew
drunker
the
dreams
faded
and
he
became
a
confused
spectre
moving
in
odd
crannies
of
his
own
mind
full
of
unexpected
devices
harshly
contemptuous
at
best
and
reaching
sodden
and
dispirited
depths
one
night
in
june
he
had
quarrelled
violently
with
maury
over
a
matter
of
the
utmost
triviality
he
remembered
dimly
next
morning
that
it
had
been
about
a
broken
pint
bottle
of
champagne
maury
had
told
him
to
sober
up
and
feelings
had
been
hurt
so
with
an
attempted
gesture
of
dignity
he
had
risen
from
the
table
and
seizing
gloria
arm
half
led
half
shamed
her
into
a
taxicab
outside
leaving
maury
with
three
dinners
ordered
and
tickets
for
the
opera
this
sort
of
fiasco
had
become
so
usual
that
when
they
occurred
he
was
no
longer
stirred
into
making
amends
if
gloria
protested
and
of
late
she
was
more
likely
to
sink
into
contemptuous
silence
he
would
either
engage
in
a
bitter
defense
of
himself
or
else
stalk
dismally
from
the
apartment
never
since
the
incident
on
the
station
platform
at
redgate
had
he
laid
his
hands
on
her
in
anger
though
he
was
withheld
often
only
by
some
instinct
that
itself
made
him
tremble
with
rage
just
as
he
still
cared
more
for
her
than
for
any
other
creature
so
did
he
more
intensely
and
frequently
hate
her
so
far
the
judges
of
the
appellate
division
had
failed
to
hand
down
a
decision
but
after
another
postponement
they
finally
affirmed
the
decree
of
the
lower
court
two
justices
dissenting
a
notice
of
appeal
was
served
upon
edward
shuttleworth
the
case
was
going
to
the
court
of
last
resort
and
they
were
in
for
another
interminable
wait
six
months
perhaps
a
year
it
had
grown
enormously
unreal
to
them
remote
and
uncertain
as
heaven
throughout
the
previous
winter
one
small
matter
had
been
a
subtle
and
omnipresent
irritant
the
question
of
gloria
gray
fur
coat
at
that
time
women
enveloped
in
long
squirrel
wraps
could
be
seen
every
few
yards
along
fifth
avenue
the
women
were
converted
to
the
shape
of
tops
they
seemed
porcine
and
obscene
they
resembled
kept
women
in
the
concealing
richness
the
feminine
animality
of
the
garment
yet
gloria
wanted
a
gray
squirrel
coat
discussing
the
matter
or
rather
arguing
it
for
even
more
than
in
the
first
year
of
their
marriage
did
every
discussion
take
the
form
of
bitter
debate
full
of
such
phrases
as
most
certainly
utterly
outrageous
it
so
nevertheless
and
the
regardless
they
concluded
that
they
could
not
afford
it
and
so
gradually
it
began
to
stand
as
a
symbol
of
their
growing
financial
anxiety
to
gloria
the
shrinkage
of
their
income
was
a
remarkable
phenomenon
without
explanation
or
precedent
that
it
could
happen
at
all
within
the
space
of
five
years
seemed
almost
an
intended
cruelty
conceived
and
executed
by
a
sardonic
god
when
they
were
married
hundred
a
year
had
seemed
ample
for
a
young
couple
especially
when
augmented
by
the
expectation
of
many
millions
gloria
had
failed
to
realize
that
it
was
decreasing
not
only
in
amount
but
in
purchasing
power
until
the
payment
of
haight
retaining
fee
of
fifteen
thousand
dollars
made
the
fact
suddenly
and
startlingly
obvious
when
anthony
was
drafted
they
had
calculated
their
income
at
over
four
hundred
a
month
with
the
dollar
even
then
decreasing
in
value
but
on
his
return
to
new
york
they
discovered
an
even
more
alarming
condition
of
affairs
they
were
receiving
only
hundred
a
year
from
their
investments
and
though
the
suit
over
the
will
moved
ahead
of
them
like
a
persistent
mirage
and
the
financial
loomed
up
in
the
near
distance
they
found
nevertheless
that
living
within
their
income
was
impossible
so
gloria
went
without
the
squirrel
coat
and
every
day
upon
fifth
avenue
she
was
a
little
conscious
of
her
leopard
skin
now
hopelessly
every
other
month
they
sold
a
bond
yet
when
the
bills
were
paid
it
left
only
enough
to
be
gulped
down
hungrily
by
their
current
expenses
anthony
calculations
showed
that
their
capital
would
last
about
seven
years
longer
so
gloria
heart
was
very
bitter
for
in
one
week
on
a
prolonged
hysterical
party
during
which
anthony
whimsically
divested
himself
of
coat
vest
and
shirt
in
a
theatre
and
was
assisted
out
by
a
posse
of
ushers
they
spent
twice
what
the
gray
squirrel
coat
would
have
cost
it
was
november
indian
summer
rather
and
a
warm
warm
night
which
was
unnecessary
for
the
work
of
the
summer
was
done
babe
ruth
had
smashed
the
record
for
the
first
time
and
jack
dempsey
had
broken
jess
willard
out
in
ohio
over
in
europe
the
usual
number
of
children
had
swollen
stomachs
from
starvation
and
the
diplomats
were
at
their
customary
business
of
making
the
world
safe
for
new
wars
in
new
york
city
the
proletariat
were
being
disciplined
and
the
odds
on
harvard
were
generally
quoted
at
five
to
three
peace
had
come
down
in
earnest
the
beginning
of
new
days
up
in
the
bedroom
of
the
apartment
on
street
gloria
lay
upon
her
bed
and
tossed
from
side
to
side
sitting
up
at
intervals
to
throw
off
a
superfluous
cover
and
once
asking
anthony
who
was
lying
awake
beside
her
to
bring
her
a
glass
of
be
sure
and
put
ice
in
it
she
said
with
insistence
it
is
cold
enough
the
way
it
comes
from
the
faucet
looking
through
the
frail
curtains
she
could
see
the
rounded
moon
over
the
roofs
and
beyond
it
on
the
sky
the
yellow
glow
from
times
square
and
watching
the
two
incongruous
lights
her
mind
worked
over
an
emotion
or
rather
an
interwoven
complex
of
emotions
that
had
occupied
it
through
the
day
and
the
day
before
that
and
back
to
the
last
time
when
she
could
remember
having
thought
clearly
and
consecutively
about
anything
which
must
have
been
while
anthony
was
in
the
army
she
would
be
in
february
the
month
assumed
an
ominous
and
inescapable
significance
making
her
wonder
through
these
nebulous
hours
whether
after
all
she
had
not
wasted
her
faintly
tired
beauty
whether
there
was
such
a
thing
as
use
for
any
quality
bounded
by
a
harsh
and
inevitable
mortality
years
before
when
she
was
she
had
written
in
her
diary
beauty
is
only
to
be
admired
only
to
be
loved
to
be
harvested
carefully
and
then
flung
at
a
chosen
lover
like
a
gift
of
roses
it
seems
to
me
so
far
as
i
can
judge
clearly
at
all
that
my
beauty
should
be
used
like
that
and
now
all
this
november
day
all
this
desolate
day
under
a
sky
dirty
and
white
gloria
had
been
thinking
that
perhaps
she
had
been
wrong
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
her
first
gift
she
had
looked
no
more
for
love
when
the
first
flame
and
ecstasy
had
grown
dim
sunk
down
departed
she
had
begun
preserving
what
it
puzzled
her
that
she
no
longer
knew
just
what
she
was
preserving
a
sentimental
memory
or
some
profound
and
fundamental
concept
of
honor
she
was
doubting
now
whether
there
had
been
any
moral
issue
involved
in
her
way
of
life
to
walk
unworried
and
unregretful
along
the
gayest
of
all
possible
lanes
and
to
keep
her
pride
by
being
always
herself
and
doing
what
it
seemed
beautiful
that
she
should
do
from
the
first
little
boy
in
an
eton
collar
whose
girl
she
had
been
down
to
the
latest
casual
man
whose
eyes
had
grown
alert
and
appreciative
as
they
rested
upon
her
there
was
needed
only
that
matchless
candor
she
could
throw
into
a
look
or
clothe
with
an
inconsequent
clause
for
she
had
talked
always
in
broken
clauses
to
weave
about
her
immeasurable
illusions
immeasurable
distances
immeasurable
light
to
create
souls
in
men
to
create
fine
happiness
and
fine
despair
she
must
remain
deeply
proud
proud
to
be
inviolate
proud
also
to
be
melting
to
be
passionate
and
possessed
she
knew
that
in
her
breast
she
had
never
wanted
children
the
reality
the
earthiness
the
intolerable
sentiment
of
the
menace
to
her
beauty
had
appalled
her
she
wanted
to
exist
only
as
a
conscious
flower
prolonging
and
preserving
itself
her
sentimentality
could
cling
fiercely
to
her
own
illusions
but
her
ironic
soul
whispered
that
motherhood
was
also
the
privilege
of
the
female
baboon
so
her
dreams
were
of
ghostly
children
only
the
early
the
perfect
symbols
of
her
early
and
perfect
love
for
anthony
in
the
end
then
her
beauty
was
all
that
never
failed
her
she
had
never
seen
beauty
like
her
own
what
it
meant
ethically
or
aesthetically
faded
before
the
gorgeous
concreteness
of
her
feet
the
clean
perfectness
of
her
body
and
the
baby
mouth
that
was
like
the
material
symbol
of
a
kiss
she
would
be
in
february
as
the
long
night
waned
she
grew
supremely
conscious
that
she
and
beauty
were
going
to
make
use
of
these
next
three
months
at
first
she
was
not
sure
for
what
but
the
problem
resolved
itself
gradually
into
the
old
lure
of
the
screen
she
was
in
earnest
now
no
material
want
could
have
moved
her
as
this
fear
moved
her
no
matter
for
anthony
anthony
the
poor
in
spirit
the
weak
and
broken
man
with
bloodshot
eyes
for
whom
she
still
had
moments
of
tenderness
no
matter
she
would
be
in
february
a
hundred
days
so
many
days
she
would
go
to
bloeckman
with
the
decision
came
relief
it
cheered
her
that
in
some
manner
the
illusion
of
beauty
could
be
sustained
or
preserved
perhaps
in
celluloid
after
the
reality
had
vanished
well
the
next
day
she
felt
weak
and
she
tried
to
go
out
and
saved
herself
from
collapse
only
by
clinging
to
a
mail
box
near
the
front
door
the
martinique
elevator
boy
helped
her
and
she
waited
on
the
bed
for
anthony
return
without
energy
to
unhook
her
brassiere
for
five
days
she
was
down
with
influenza
which
just
as
the
month
turned
the
corner
into
winter
ripened
into
double
pneumonia
in
the
feverish
perambulations
of
her
mind
she
prowled
through
a
house
of
bleak
unlighted
rooms
hunting
for
her
mother
all
she
wanted
was
to
be
a
little
girl
to
be
efficiently
taken
care
of
by
some
yielding
yet
superior
power
stupider
and
steadier
than
herself
it
seemed
that
the
only
lover
she
had
ever
wanted
was
a
lover
in
a
dream
odi
profanum
vulgus
one
day
in
the
midst
of
gloria
illness
there
occurred
a
curious
incident
that
puzzled
miss
mcgovern
the
trained
nurse
for
some
time
afterward
it
was
noon
but
the
room
in
which
the
patient
lay
was
dark
and
quiet
miss
mcgovern
was
standing
near
the
bed
mixing
some
medicine
when
patch
who
had
apparently
been
sound
asleep
sat
up
and
began
to
speak
vehemently
millions
of
people
she
said
swarming
like
rats
chattering
like
apes
smelling
like
all
hell
monkeys
or
lice
i
suppose
for
one
really
exquisite
palace
on
long
island
say
or
even
in
greenwich
for
one
palace
full
of
pictures
from
the
old
world
and
exquisite
things
with
avenues
of
trees
and
green
lawns
and
a
view
of
the
blue
sea
and
lovely
people
about
in
slick
dresses
i
sacrifice
a
hundred
thousand
of
them
a
million
of
them
she
raised
her
hand
feebly
and
snapped
her
fingers
i
care
nothing
for
them
understand
me
the
look
she
bent
upon
miss
mcgovern
at
the
conclusion
of
this
speech
was
curiously
elfin
curiously
intent
then
she
gave
a
short
little
laugh
polished
with
scorn
and
tumbling
backward
fell
off
again
to
sleep
miss
mcgovern
was
bewildered
she
wondered
what
were
the
hundred
thousand
things
that
patch
would
sacrifice
for
her
palace
dollars
she
supposed
yet
it
had
not
sounded
exactly
like
dollars
the
movies
it
was
february
seven
days
before
her
birthday
and
the
great
snow
that
had
filled
up
the
as
dirt
fills
the
cracks
in
a
floor
had
turned
to
slush
and
was
being
escorted
to
the
gutters
by
the
hoses
of
the
department
the
wind
none
the
less
bitter
for
being
casual
whipped
in
through
the
open
windows
of
the
living
room
bearing
with
it
the
dismal
secrets
of
the
areaway
and
clearing
the
patch
apartment
of
stale
smoke
in
its
cheerless
circulation
gloria
wrapped
in
a
warm
kimona
came
into
the
chilly
room
and
taking
up
the
telephone
receiver
called
joseph
bloeckman
do
you
mean
joseph
demanded
the
telephone
girl
at
films
par
excellence
bloeckman
joseph
bloeckman
joseph
bloeckman
has
changed
his
name
to
black
do
you
want
him
why
yes
she
remembered
nervously
that
she
had
once
called
him
blockhead
to
his
face
his
office
was
reached
by
courtesy
of
two
additional
female
voices
the
last
was
a
secretary
who
took
her
name
only
with
the
flow
through
the
transmitter
of
his
own
familiar
but
faintly
impersonal
tone
did
she
realize
that
it
had
been
three
years
since
they
had
met
and
he
had
changed
his
name
to
black
can
you
see
me
she
suggested
lightly
it
on
a
business
matter
really
i
going
into
the
movies
at
last
if
i
can
i
awfully
glad
i
always
thought
you
like
it
do
you
think
you
can
get
me
a
trial
she
demanded
with
the
arrogance
peculiar
to
all
beautiful
women
to
all
women
who
have
ever
at
any
time
considered
themselves
beautiful
he
assured
her
that
it
was
merely
a
question
of
when
she
wanted
the
trial
any
time
well
he
phone
later
in
the
day
and
let
her
know
a
convenient
hour
the
conversation
closed
with
conventional
padding
on
both
sides
then
from
three
to
five
she
sat
close
to
the
telephone
with
no
result
but
next
morning
came
a
note
that
contented
and
excited
her
dear
gloria
by
luck
a
matter
came
to
my
attention
that
i
think
will
be
just
suited
to
you
i
would
like
to
see
you
start
with
something
that
would
bring
you
notice
at
the
same
time
if
a
very
beautiful
girl
of
your
sort
is
put
directly
into
a
picture
next
to
one
of
the
rather
stars
with
which
every
company
is
afflicted
tongues
would
very
likely
wag
but
there
is
a
flapper
part
in
a
percy
debris
production
that
i
think
would
be
just
suited
to
you
and
would
bring
you
notice
willa
sable
plays
opposite
gaston
mears
in
a
sort
of
character
part
and
your
part
i
believe
would
be
her
younger
percy
debris
who
is
directing
the
picture
says
if
you
come
to
the
studios
day
after
thursday
he
will
run
off
a
test
if
ten
is
suited
to
you
i
will
meet
you
there
at
that
all
good
joseph
black
gloria
had
decided
that
anthony
was
to
know
nothing
of
this
until
she
had
obtained
a
definite
position
and
accordingly
she
was
dressed
and
out
of
the
apartment
next
morning
before
he
awoke
her
mirror
had
given
her
she
thought
much
the
same
account
as
ever
she
wondered
if
there
were
any
lingering
traces
of
her
sickness
she
was
still
slightly
under
weight
and
she
had
fancied
a
few
days
before
that
her
cheeks
were
a
trifle
thinner
but
she
felt
that
those
were
merely
transitory
conditions
and
that
on
this
particular
day
she
looked
as
fresh
as
ever
she
had
bought
and
charged
a
new
hat
and
as
the
day
was
warm
she
had
left
the
leopard
skin
coat
at
home
at
the
films
par
excellence
studios
she
was
announced
over
the
telephone
and
told
that
black
would
be
down
directly
she
looked
around
her
two
girls
were
being
shown
about
by
a
little
fat
man
in
a
coat
and
one
of
them
had
indicated
a
stack
of
thin
parcels
piled
against
the
wall
and
extending
along
for
twenty
feet
that
studio
mail
explained
the
fat
man
pictures
of
the
stars
who
are
with
par
excellence
oh
each
one
autographed
by
florence
kelley
or
gaston
mears
or
mack
dodge
he
winked
confidentially
at
least
when
minnie
mcglook
out
in
sauk
center
gets
the
picture
she
wrote
for
she
autographed
just
a
stamp
sure
it
take
a
good
day
to
autograph
half
of
they
say
mary
pickford
studio
mail
costs
her
fifty
thousand
a
year
say
sure
fifty
thousand
but
it
the
best
kinda
advertising
there
is
they
drifted
out
of
earshot
and
almost
immediately
bloeckman
appeared
bloeckman
a
dark
suave
gentleman
gracefully
engaged
in
the
middle
forties
who
greeted
her
with
courteous
warmth
and
told
her
she
had
not
changed
a
bit
in
three
years
he
led
the
way
into
a
great
hall
as
large
as
an
armory
and
broken
intermittently
with
busy
sets
and
blinding
rows
of
unfamiliar
light
each
piece
of
scenery
was
marked
in
large
white
letters
gaston
mears
company
mack
dodge
company
or
simply
films
par
excellence
ever
been
in
a
studio
before
never
have
she
liked
it
there
was
no
heavy
closeness
of
greasepaint
no
scent
of
soiled
and
tawdry
costumes
which
years
before
had
revolted
her
behind
the
scenes
of
a
musical
comedy
this
work
was
done
in
the
clean
mornings
the
appurtenances
seemed
rich
and
gorgeous
and
new
on
a
set
that
was
joyous
with
manchu
hangings
a
perfect
chinaman
was
going
through
a
scene
according
to
megaphone
directions
as
the
great
glittering
machine
ground
out
its
ancient
moral
tale
for
the
edification
of
the
national
mind
a
man
approached
them
and
spoke
with
familiar
deference
to
bloeckman
who
answered
hello
debris
want
you
to
meet
patch
patch
wants
to
go
into
pictures
as
i
explained
to
you
all
right
now
where
do
we
go
debris
the
great
percy
debris
thought
gloria
showed
them
to
a
set
which
represented
the
interior
of
an
office
some
chairs
were
drawn
up
around
the
camera
which
stood
in
front
of
it
and
the
three
of
them
sat
down
ever
been
in
a
studio
before
asked
debris
giving
her
a
glance
that
was
surely
the
quintessence
of
keenness
no
well
i
explain
exactly
what
going
to
happen
we
going
to
take
what
we
call
a
test
in
order
to
see
how
your
features
photograph
and
whether
you
got
natural
stage
presence
and
how
you
respond
to
coaching
there
no
need
to
be
nervous
over
it
i
just
have
the
take
a
few
hundred
feet
in
an
episode
i
got
marked
here
in
the
scenario
we
can
tell
pretty
much
what
we
want
to
from
that
he
produced
a
typewritten
continuity
and
explained
to
her
the
episode
she
was
to
enact
it
developed
that
one
barbara
wainwright
had
been
secretly
married
to
the
junior
partner
of
the
firm
whose
office
was
there
represented
entering
the
deserted
office
one
day
by
accident
she
was
naturally
interested
in
seeing
where
her
husband
worked
the
telephone
rang
and
after
some
hesitation
she
answered
it
she
learned
that
her
husband
had
been
struck
by
an
automobile
and
instantly
killed
she
was
overcome
at
first
she
was
unable
to
realize
the
truth
but
finally
she
succeeded
in
comprehending
it
and
went
into
a
dead
faint
on
the
floor
now
that
all
we
want
concluded
debris
i
going
to
stand
here
and
tell
you
approximately
what
to
do
and
you
to
act
as
though
i
was
here
and
just
go
on
do
it
your
own
way
you
need
be
afraid
we
going
to
judge
this
too
severely
we
simply
want
to
get
a
general
idea
of
your
screen
personality
i
see
you
find
in
the
room
in
back
of
the
set
go
light
on
it
very
little
red
i
see
repeated
gloria
nodding
she
touched
her
lips
nervously
with
the
tip
of
her
tongue
the
test
as
she
came
into
the
set
through
the
real
wooden
door
and
closed
it
carefully
behind
her
she
found
herself
inconveniently
dissatisfied
with
her
clothes
she
should
have
bought
a
misses
dress
for
the
occasion
she
could
still
wear
them
and
it
might
have
been
a
good
investment
if
it
had
accentuated
her
airy
youth
her
mind
snapped
sharply
into
the
momentous
present
as
voice
came
from
the
glare
of
the
white
lights
in
front
you
look
around
for
your
husband
now
you
do
see
him
curious
about
the
office
she
became
conscious
of
the
regular
sound
of
the
camera
it
worried
her
she
glanced
toward
it
involuntarily
and
wondered
if
she
had
made
up
her
face
correctly
then
with
a
definite
effort
she
forced
herself
to
act
and
she
had
never
felt
that
the
gestures
of
her
body
were
so
banal
so
awkward
so
bereft
of
grace
or
distinction
she
strolled
around
the
office
picking
up
articles
here
and
there
and
looking
at
them
inanely
then
she
scrutinized
the
ceiling
the
floor
and
thoroughly
inspected
an
inconsequential
lead
pencil
on
the
desk
finally
because
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
do
and
less
than
nothing
to
express
she
forced
a
smile
all
right
now
the
phone
rings
hesitate
and
then
answer
it
she
hesitated
and
then
too
quickly
she
thought
picked
up
the
receiver
hello
her
voice
was
hollow
and
unreal
the
words
rang
in
the
empty
set
like
the
ineffectualities
of
a
ghost
the
absurdities
of
their
requirements
appalled
her
did
they
expect
that
on
an
instant
notice
she
could
put
herself
in
the
place
of
this
preposterous
and
unexplained
character
no
no
not
yet
now
listen
sumner
has
just
been
knocked
over
by
an
automobile
and
instantly
killed
gloria
let
her
baby
mouth
drop
slowly
open
then
now
hang
up
with
a
bang
she
obeyed
clung
to
the
table
with
her
eyes
wide
and
staring
at
length
she
was
feeling
slightly
encouraged
and
her
confidence
increased
my
god
she
cried
her
voice
was
good
she
thought
oh
my
god
now
faint
she
collapsed
forward
to
her
knees
and
throwing
her
body
outward
on
the
ground
lay
without
breathing
all
right
called
debris
that
enough
thank
you
plenty
get
up
that
enough
gloria
arose
mustering
her
dignity
and
brushing
off
her
skirt
awful
she
remarked
with
a
cool
laugh
though
her
heart
was
bumping
tumultuously
terrible
was
it
did
you
mind
it
said
debris
smiling
blandly
did
it
seem
hard
i
ca
tell
anything
about
it
until
i
have
it
run
off
of
course
not
she
agreed
trying
to
attach
some
sort
of
meaning
to
his
remark
and
failing
it
was
just
the
sort
of
thing
he
would
have
said
had
he
been
trying
not
to
encourage
her
a
few
moments
later
she
left
the
studio
bloeckman
had
promised
that
she
should
hear
the
result
of
the
test
within
the
next
few
days
too
proud
to
force
any
definite
comment
she
felt
a
baffling
uncertainty
and
only
now
when
the
step
had
at
last
been
taken
did
she
realize
how
the
possibility
of
a
successful
screen
career
had
played
in
the
back
of
her
mind
for
the
past
three
years
that
night
she
tried
to
tell
over
to
herself
the
elements
that
might
decide
for
or
against
her
whether
or
not
she
had
used
enough
worried
her
and
as
the
part
was
that
of
a
girl
of
twenty
she
wondered
if
she
had
not
been
just
a
little
too
grave
about
her
acting
she
was
least
of
all
satisfied
her
entrance
had
been
abominable
in
fact
not
until
she
reached
the
phone
had
she
displayed
a
shred
of
poise
and
then
the
test
had
been
over
if
they
had
only
realized
she
wished
that
she
could
try
it
again
a
mad
plan
to
call
up
in
the
morning
and
ask
for
a
new
trial
took
possession
of
her
and
as
suddenly
faded
it
seemed
neither
politic
nor
polite
to
ask
another
favor
of
bloeckman
the
third
day
of
waiting
found
her
in
a
highly
nervous
condition
she
had
bitten
the
insides
of
her
mouth
until
they
were
raw
and
smarting
and
burnt
unbearably
when
she
washed
them
with
listerine
she
had
quarrelled
so
persistently
with
anthony
that
he
had
left
the
apartment
in
a
cold
fury
but
because
he
was
intimidated
by
her
exceptional
frigidity
he
called
up
an
hour
afterward
apologized
and
said
he
was
having
dinner
at
the
amsterdam
club
the
only
one
in
which
he
still
retained
membership
it
was
after
one
and
she
had
breakfasted
at
eleven
so
deciding
to
forego
luncheon
she
started
for
a
walk
in
the
park
at
three
there
would
be
a
mail
she
would
be
back
by
three
it
was
an
afternoon
of
premature
spring
water
was
drying
on
the
walks
and
in
the
park
little
girls
were
gravely
wheeling
white
up
and
down
under
the
thin
trees
while
behind
them
followed
bored
in
two
discussing
with
each
other
those
tremendous
secrets
that
are
peculiar
to
two
by
her
little
gold
watch
she
should
have
a
new
watch
one
made
in
a
platinum
oblong
and
incrusted
with
diamonds
but
those
cost
even
more
than
squirrel
coats
and
of
course
they
were
out
of
her
reach
now
like
everything
else
unless
perhaps
the
right
letter
was
awaiting
her
in
about
an
hour
minutes
exactly
ten
to
get
there
left
now
little
girls
soberly
wheeling
their
buggies
along
the
damp
sunny
walks
the
chattering
in
pairs
about
their
inscrutable
secrets
here
and
there
a
raggedy
man
seated
upon
newspapers
spread
on
a
drying
bench
related
not
to
the
radiant
and
delightful
afternoon
but
to
the
dirty
snow
that
slept
exhausted
in
obscure
corners
waiting
for
extermination
ages
later
coming
into
the
dim
hall
she
saw
the
martinique
elevator
boy
standing
incongruously
in
the
light
of
the
window
is
there
any
mail
for
us
she
asked
madame
the
switchboard
squawked
abominably
and
gloria
waited
while
he
ministered
to
the
telephone
she
sickened
as
the
elevator
groaned
its
way
up
the
floors
passed
like
the
slow
lapse
of
centuries
each
one
ominous
accusing
significant
the
letter
a
white
leprous
spot
lay
upon
the
dirty
tiles
of
the
hall
dear
gloria
had
the
test
run
off
yesterday
afternoon
and
debris
seemed
to
think
that
for
the
part
he
had
in
mind
he
needed
a
younger
woman
he
said
that
the
acting
was
not
bad
and
that
there
was
a
small
character
part
supposed
to
be
a
very
haughty
rich
widow
that
he
thought
you
might
desolately
gloria
raised
her
glance
until
it
fell
out
across
the
areaway
but
she
found
she
could
not
see
the
opposite
wall
for
her
gray
eyes
were
full
of
tears
she
walked
into
the
bedroom
the
letter
crinkled
tightly
in
her
hand
and
sank
down
upon
her
knees
before
the
long
mirror
on
the
wardrobe
floor
this
was
her
birthday
and
the
world
was
melting
away
before
her
eyes
she
tried
to
think
that
it
had
been
the
but
her
emotions
were
too
profound
too
overwhelming
for
any
consolation
that
the
thought
conveyed
she
strained
to
see
until
she
could
feel
the
flesh
on
her
temples
pull
forward
yes
the
cheeks
were
ever
so
faintly
thin
the
corners
of
the
eyes
were
lined
with
tiny
wrinkles
the
eyes
were
different
why
they
were
different
and
then
suddenly
she
knew
how
tired
her
eyes
were
oh
my
pretty
face
she
whispered
passionately
grieving
oh
my
pretty
face
oh
i
do
want
to
live
without
my
pretty
face
oh
then
she
slid
toward
the
mirror
and
as
in
the
test
sprawled
face
downward
upon
the
floor
and
lay
there
sobbing
it
was
the
first
awkward
movement
she
had
ever
made
chapter
iii
no
matter
within
another
year
anthony
and
gloria
had
become
like
players
who
had
lost
their
costumes
lacking
the
pride
to
continue
on
the
note
of
tragedy
so
that
when
and
miss
hulme
of
kansas
city
cut
them
dead
in
the
plaza
one
evening
it
was
only
that
and
miss
hulme
like
most
people
abominated
mirrors
of
their
atavistic
selves
their
new
apartment
for
which
they
paid
dollars
a
month
was
situated
on
claremont
avenue
which
is
two
blocks
from
the
hudson
in
the
dim
hundreds
they
had
lived
there
a
month
when
muriel
kane
came
to
see
them
late
one
afternoon
it
was
a
reproachless
twilight
on
the
summer
side
of
spring
anthony
lay
upon
the
lounge
looking
up
one
hundred
and
street
toward
the
river
near
which
he
could
just
see
a
single
patch
of
vivid
green
trees
that
guaranteed
the
brummagem
umbrageousness
of
riverside
drive
across
the
water
were
the
palisades
crowned
by
the
ugly
framework
of
the
amusement
park
yet
soon
it
would
be
dusk
and
those
same
iron
cobwebs
would
be
a
glory
against
the
heavens
an
enchanted
palace
set
over
the
smooth
radiance
of
a
tropical
canal
the
streets
near
the
apartment
anthony
had
found
were
streets
where
children
played
streets
a
little
nicer
than
those
he
had
been
used
to
pass
on
his
way
to
marietta
but
of
the
same
general
sort
with
an
occasional
hand
organ
or
and
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
many
pairs
of
young
girls
walking
down
to
the
corner
for
ice
cream
soda
and
dreaming
unlimited
dreams
under
the
low
heavens
dusk
in
the
streets
now
and
children
playing
shouting
up
incoherent
ecstatic
words
that
faded
out
close
to
the
open
window
and
muriel
who
had
come
to
find
gloria
chattering
to
him
from
an
opaque
gloom
over
across
the
room
light
the
lamp
why
do
we
she
suggested
it
getting
in
here
with
a
tired
movement
he
arose
and
obeyed
the
gray
vanished
he
stretched
himself
he
was
heavier
now
his
stomach
was
a
limp
weight
against
his
belt
his
flesh
had
softened
and
expanded
he
was
and
his
mind
was
a
bleak
and
disordered
wreck
have
a
little
drink
muriel
not
me
thanks
i
do
use
it
anymore
what
you
doing
these
days
anthony
she
asked
curiously
well
i
been
pretty
busy
with
this
lawsuit
he
answered
indifferently
it
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals
ought
to
be
settled
up
one
way
or
another
by
autumn
there
been
some
objection
as
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
has
jurisdiction
over
the
matter
muriel
made
a
clicking
sound
with
her
tongue
and
cocked
her
head
on
one
side
well
you
i
never
heard
of
anything
taking
so
long
oh
they
all
do
he
replied
listlessly
all
will
cases
they
say
exceptional
to
have
one
settled
under
four
or
five
years
oh
muriel
daringly
changed
her
tack
why
do
you
go
to
work
you
at
what
he
demanded
abruptly
why
at
anything
i
suppose
you
still
a
young
man
if
that
encouragement
i
much
obliged
he
answered
dryly
and
then
with
sudden
weariness
does
it
bother
you
particularly
that
i
want
to
work
it
does
bother
me
but
it
does
bother
a
lot
of
people
who
claim
oh
god
he
said
brokenly
it
seems
to
me
that
for
three
years
heard
nothing
about
myself
but
wild
stories
and
virtuous
admonitions
i
tired
of
it
if
you
do
want
to
see
us
let
us
alone
i
bother
my
former
friends
but
i
need
no
charity
calls
and
no
criticism
disguised
as
good
advice
then
he
added
apologetically
sorry
but
really
muriel
you
must
talk
like
a
lady
even
if
you
are
visiting
the
lower
middle
classes
he
turned
his
bloodshot
eyes
on
her
reproachfully
eyes
that
had
once
been
a
deep
clear
blue
that
were
weak
now
strained
and
from
reading
when
he
was
drunk
why
do
you
say
such
awful
things
she
protested
you
talk
as
if
you
and
gloria
were
in
the
middle
classes
why
pretend
we
not
i
hate
people
who
claim
to
be
great
aristocrats
when
they
ca
even
keep
up
the
appearances
of
it
do
you
think
a
person
has
to
have
money
to
be
aristocratic
muriel
the
horrified
democrat
why
of
course
aristocracy
only
an
admission
that
certain
traits
which
we
call
fine
courage
and
honor
and
beauty
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
can
best
be
developed
in
a
favorable
environment
where
you
have
the
warpings
of
ignorance
and
necessity
muriel
bit
her
lower
lip
and
waved
her
head
from
side
to
side
well
all
say
is
that
if
a
person
comes
from
a
good
family
always
nice
people
that
the
trouble
with
you
and
gloria
you
think
that
just
because
things
are
going
your
way
right
now
all
your
old
friends
are
trying
to
avoid
you
you
too
sensitive
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
anthony
you
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
with
me
it
simply
a
matter
of
pride
and
for
once
gloria
reasonable
enough
to
agree
that
we
ought
go
where
we
not
wanted
and
people
do
want
us
we
too
much
the
ideal
bad
examples
nonsense
you
ca
park
your
pessimism
in
my
little
sun
parlor
i
think
you
ought
to
forget
all
those
morbid
speculations
and
go
to
work
here
i
am
suppose
i
did
start
in
at
some
idiotic
business
perhaps
in
two
years
i
might
rise
to
fifty
dollars
a
week
with
luck
that
i
could
get
a
job
at
all
there
an
awful
lot
of
unemployment
well
suppose
i
made
fifty
a
week
do
you
think
i
be
any
happier
do
you
think
that
if
i
do
get
this
money
of
my
life
will
be
muriel
smiled
complacently
well
she
said
that
may
be
clever
but
it
is
common
sense
a
few
minutes
later
gloria
came
in
seeming
to
bring
with
her
into
the
room
some
dark
color
indeterminate
and
rare
in
a
taciturn
way
she
was
happy
to
see
muriel
she
greeted
anthony
with
a
casual
hi
i
been
talking
philosophy
with
your
husband
cried
the
irrepressible
miss
kane
we
took
up
some
fundamental
concepts
said
anthony
a
faint
smile
disturbing
his
pale
cheeks
paler
still
under
two
days
growth
of
beard
oblivious
to
his
irony
muriel
rehashed
her
contention
when
she
had
done
gloria
said
quietly
anthony
right
it
no
fun
to
go
around
when
you
have
the
sense
that
people
are
looking
at
you
in
a
certain
way
he
broke
in
plaintively
do
you
think
that
when
even
maury
noble
who
was
my
best
friend
wo
come
to
see
us
it
high
time
to
stop
calling
people
up
tears
were
standing
in
his
eyes
that
was
your
fault
about
maury
noble
said
gloria
coolly
it
was
it
most
certainly
was
muriel
intervened
quickly
i
met
a
girl
who
knew
maury
the
other
day
and
she
says
he
drink
any
more
he
getting
pretty
cagey
does
practically
not
at
all
he
making
of
money
he
sort
of
changed
since
the
war
he
going
to
marry
a
girl
in
philadelphia
who
has
millions
ceci
larrabee
anyhow
that
what
town
tattle
said
he
said
anthony
thinking
aloud
but
it
odd
to
imagine
his
getting
married
i
used
to
think
he
was
so
brilliant
he
was
murmured
gloria
in
a
way
but
brilliant
people
do
settle
down
in
business
or
do
they
or
what
do
they
do
or
what
becomes
of
everybody
you
used
to
know
and
have
so
much
in
common
with
you
drift
apart
suggested
muriel
with
the
appropriate
dreamy
look
they
change
said
gloria
all
the
qualities
that
they
do
use
in
their
daily
lives
get
cobwebbed
up
the
last
thing
he
said
to
me
recollected
anthony
was
that
he
was
going
to
work
so
as
to
forget
that
there
was
nothing
worth
working
for
muriel
caught
at
this
quickly
that
what
ought
to
do
she
exclaimed
triumphantly
of
course
i
should
think
anybody
would
want
to
work
for
nothing
but
it
give
you
something
to
do
what
do
you
do
with
yourselves
anyway
nobody
ever
sees
you
at
montmartre
or
or
anywhere
are
you
economizing
gloria
laughed
scornfully
glancing
at
anthony
from
the
corners
of
her
eyes
well
he
demanded
what
are
you
laughing
at
you
know
what
i
laughing
at
she
answered
coldly
at
that
case
of
whiskey
yes
she
turned
to
muriel
he
paid
dollars
for
a
case
of
whiskey
yesterday
what
if
i
did
it
cheaper
that
way
than
if
you
get
it
by
the
bottle
you
need
pretend
that
you
wo
drink
any
of
it
at
least
i
do
drink
in
the
daytime
that
a
fine
distinction
he
cried
springing
to
his
feet
in
a
weak
rage
what
more
i
be
damned
if
you
can
hurl
that
at
me
every
few
minutes
it
true
it
is
and
i
getting
sick
of
this
eternal
business
of
criticising
me
before
visitors
he
had
worked
himself
up
to
such
a
state
that
his
arms
and
shoulders
were
visibly
trembling
you
think
everything
was
my
fault
you
think
you
had
encouraged
me
to
spend
money
and
spent
a
lot
more
on
yourself
than
i
ever
did
by
a
long
shot
now
gloria
rose
to
her
feet
i
let
you
talk
to
me
that
way
all
right
then
by
heaven
you
do
have
to
in
a
sort
of
rush
he
left
the
room
the
two
women
heard
his
steps
in
the
hall
and
then
the
front
door
banged
gloria
sank
back
into
her
chair
her
face
was
lovely
in
the
lamplight
composed
inscrutable
oh
cried
muriel
in
distress
oh
what
the
matter
nothing
particularly
he
just
drunk
drunk
why
he
perfectly
sober
he
talked
gloria
shook
her
head
oh
no
he
does
show
it
any
more
unless
he
can
hardly
stand
up
and
he
talks
all
right
until
he
gets
excited
he
talks
much
better
than
he
does
when
he
sober
but
he
been
sitting
here
all
day
drinking
except
for
the
time
it
took
him
to
walk
to
the
corner
for
a
newspaper
oh
how
terrible
muriel
was
sincerely
moved
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
has
this
happened
much
drinking
you
mean
no
this
leaving
you
oh
yes
frequently
he
come
in
about
midnight
and
weep
and
ask
me
to
forgive
him
and
do
you
i
do
know
we
just
go
on
the
two
women
sat
there
in
the
lamplight
and
looked
at
each
other
each
in
a
different
way
helpless
before
this
thing
gloria
was
still
pretty
as
pretty
as
she
would
ever
be
again
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
she
was
wearing
a
new
dress
that
she
had
bought
imprudently
for
fifty
dollars
she
had
hoped
she
could
persuade
anthony
to
take
her
out
to
a
restaurant
or
even
to
one
of
the
great
gorgeous
moving
picture
palaces
where
there
would
be
a
few
people
to
look
at
her
at
whom
she
could
bear
to
look
in
turn
she
wanted
this
because
she
knew
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
because
her
dress
was
new
and
becomingly
fragile
only
very
occasionally
now
did
they
receive
any
invitations
but
she
did
not
tell
these
things
to
muriel
gloria
dear
i
wish
we
could
have
dinner
together
but
i
promised
a
man
and
it
already
i
got
to
oh
i
could
anyway
in
the
first
place
i
been
ill
all
day
i
could
eat
a
thing
after
she
had
walked
with
muriel
to
the
door
gloria
came
back
into
the
room
turned
out
the
lamp
and
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
window
sill
looked
out
at
palisades
park
where
the
brilliant
revolving
circle
of
the
ferris
wheel
was
like
a
trembling
mirror
catching
the
yellow
reflection
of
the
moon
the
street
was
quiet
now
the
children
had
gone
in
over
the
way
she
could
see
a
family
at
dinner
pointlessly
ridiculously
they
rose
and
walked
about
the
table
seen
thus
all
that
they
did
appeared
incongruous
it
was
as
though
they
were
being
jiggled
carelessly
and
to
no
purpose
by
invisible
overhead
wires
she
looked
at
her
watch
it
was
eight
she
had
been
pleased
for
a
part
of
the
day
the
early
afternoon
in
walking
along
that
broadway
of
harlem
one
hundred
and
street
with
her
nostrils
alert
to
many
odors
and
her
mind
excited
by
the
extraordinary
beauty
of
some
italian
children
it
affected
her
curiously
as
fifth
avenue
had
affected
her
once
in
the
days
when
with
the
placid
confidence
of
beauty
she
had
known
that
it
was
all
hers
every
shop
and
all
it
held
every
adult
toy
glittering
in
a
window
all
hers
for
the
asking
here
on
one
hundred
and
street
there
were
salvation
army
bands
and
old
ladies
on
and
sugary
sticky
candy
in
the
grimy
hands
of
children
and
the
late
sun
striking
down
on
the
sides
of
the
tall
tenements
all
very
rich
and
racy
and
savory
like
a
dish
by
a
provident
french
chef
that
one
could
not
help
enjoying
even
though
one
knew
that
the
ingredients
were
probably
gloria
shuddered
suddenly
as
a
river
siren
came
moaning
over
the
dusky
roofs
and
leaning
back
in
till
the
ghostly
curtains
fell
from
her
shoulder
she
turned
on
the
electric
lamp
it
was
growing
late
she
knew
there
was
some
change
in
her
purse
and
she
considered
whether
she
would
go
down
and
have
some
coffee
and
rolls
where
the
liberated
subway
made
a
roaring
cave
of
manhattan
street
or
eat
the
devilled
ham
and
bread
in
the
kitchen
her
purse
decided
for
her
it
contained
a
nickel
and
two
pennies
after
an
hour
the
silence
of
the
room
had
grown
unbearable
and
she
found
that
her
eyes
were
wandering
from
her
magazine
to
the
ceiling
toward
which
she
stared
without
thought
suddenly
she
stood
up
hesitated
for
a
moment
biting
at
her
finger
then
she
went
to
the
pantry
took
down
a
bottle
of
whiskey
from
the
shelf
and
poured
herself
a
drink
she
filled
up
the
glass
with
ginger
ale
and
returning
to
her
chair
finished
an
article
in
the
magazine
it
concerned
the
last
revolutionary
widow
who
when
a
young
girl
had
married
an
ancient
veteran
of
the
continental
army
and
who
had
died
in
it
seemed
strange
and
oddly
romantic
to
gloria
that
she
and
this
woman
had
been
contemporaries
she
turned
a
page
and
learned
that
a
candidate
for
congress
was
being
accused
of
atheism
by
an
opponent
gloria
surprise
vanished
when
she
found
that
the
charges
were
false
the
candidate
had
merely
denied
the
miracle
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
he
admitted
under
pressure
that
he
gave
full
credence
to
the
stroll
upon
the
water
finishing
her
first
drink
gloria
got
herself
a
second
after
slipping
on
a
negligée
and
making
herself
comfortable
on
the
lounge
she
became
conscious
that
she
was
miserable
and
that
the
tears
were
rolling
down
her
cheeks
she
wondered
if
they
were
tears
of
and
tried
resolutely
not
to
cry
but
this
existence
without
hope
without
happiness
oppressed
her
and
she
kept
shaking
her
head
from
side
to
side
her
mouth
drawn
down
tremulously
in
the
corners
as
though
she
were
denying
an
assertion
made
by
some
one
somewhere
she
did
not
know
that
this
gesture
of
hers
was
years
older
than
history
that
for
a
hundred
generations
of
men
intolerable
and
persistent
grief
has
offered
that
gesture
of
denial
of
protest
of
bewilderment
to
something
more
profound
more
powerful
than
the
god
made
in
the
image
of
man
and
before
which
that
god
did
he
exist
would
be
equally
impotent
it
is
a
truth
set
at
the
heart
of
tragedy
that
this
force
never
explains
never
answers
this
force
intangible
as
air
more
definite
than
death
richard
caramel
early
in
the
summer
anthony
resigned
from
his
last
club
the
amsterdam
he
had
come
to
visit
it
hardly
twice
a
year
and
the
dues
were
a
recurrent
burden
he
had
joined
it
on
his
return
from
italy
because
it
had
been
his
grandfather
club
and
his
father
and
because
it
was
a
club
that
given
the
opportunity
one
indisputably
joined
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
preferred
the
harvard
club
largely
because
of
dick
and
maury
however
with
the
decline
of
his
fortunes
it
had
seemed
an
increasingly
desirable
bauble
to
cling
to
it
was
relinquished
at
the
last
with
some
regret
his
companions
numbered
now
a
curious
dozen
several
of
them
he
had
met
in
a
place
called
sammy
on
street
where
if
one
knocked
on
the
door
and
were
favorably
passed
on
from
behind
a
grating
one
could
sit
around
a
great
round
table
drinking
fairly
good
whiskey
it
was
here
that
he
encountered
a
man
named
parker
allison
who
had
been
exactly
the
wrong
sort
of
rounder
at
harvard
and
who
was
running
through
a
large
yeast
fortune
as
rapidly
as
possible
parker
notion
of
distinction
consisted
in
driving
a
noisy
up
broadway
with
two
glittering
girls
beside
him
he
was
the
sort
who
dined
with
two
girls
rather
than
with
one
his
imagination
was
almost
incapable
of
sustaining
a
dialogue
besides
allison
there
was
pete
lytell
who
wore
a
gray
derby
on
the
side
of
his
head
he
always
had
money
and
he
was
customarily
cheerful
so
anthony
held
aimless
conversation
with
him
through
many
afternoons
of
the
summer
and
fall
lytell
he
found
not
only
talked
but
reasoned
in
phrases
his
philosophy
was
a
series
of
them
assimilated
here
and
there
through
an
active
thoughtless
life
he
had
phrases
about
socialism
the
immemorial
ones
he
had
phrases
pertaining
to
the
existence
of
a
personal
deity
something
about
one
time
when
he
had
been
in
a
railroad
accident
and
he
had
phrases
about
the
irish
problem
the
sort
of
woman
he
respected
and
the
futility
of
prohibition
the
only
time
his
conversation
ever
rose
superior
to
these
muddled
clauses
with
which
he
interpreted
the
most
rococo
happenings
in
a
life
that
had
been
more
than
usually
eventful
was
when
he
got
down
to
the
detailed
discussion
of
his
most
animal
existence
he
knew
to
a
subtlety
the
foods
the
liquor
and
the
women
that
he
preferred
he
was
at
once
the
commonest
and
the
most
remarkable
product
of
civilization
he
was
nine
out
of
ten
people
that
one
passes
on
a
city
street
and
he
was
a
hairless
ape
with
two
dozen
tricks
he
was
the
hero
of
a
thousand
romances
of
life
and
art
and
he
was
a
virtual
moron
performing
staidly
yet
absurdly
a
series
of
complicated
and
infinitely
astounding
epics
over
a
span
of
threescore
years
with
such
men
as
these
two
anthony
patch
drank
and
discussed
and
drank
and
argued
he
liked
them
because
they
knew
nothing
about
him
because
they
lived
in
the
obvious
and
had
not
the
faintest
conception
of
the
inevitable
continuity
of
life
they
sat
not
before
a
motion
picture
with
consecutive
reels
but
at
a
musty
travelogue
with
all
values
stark
and
hence
all
implications
confused
yet
they
themselves
were
not
confused
because
there
was
nothing
in
them
to
be
confused
they
changed
phrases
from
month
to
month
as
they
changed
neckties
anthony
the
courteous
the
subtle
the
perspicacious
was
drunk
each
day
in
sammy
with
these
men
in
the
apartment
over
a
book
some
book
he
knew
and
very
rarely
with
gloria
who
in
his
eyes
had
begun
to
develop
the
unmistakable
outlines
of
a
quarrelsome
and
unreasonable
woman
she
was
not
the
gloria
of
old
certainly
the
gloria
who
had
she
been
sick
would
have
preferred
to
inflict
misery
upon
every
one
around
her
rather
than
confess
that
she
needed
sympathy
or
assistance
she
was
not
above
whining
now
she
was
not
above
being
sorry
for
herself
each
night
when
she
prepared
for
bed
she
smeared
her
face
with
some
new
unguent
which
she
hoped
illogically
would
give
back
the
glow
and
freshness
to
her
vanishing
beauty
when
anthony
was
drunk
he
taunted
her
about
this
when
he
was
sober
he
was
polite
to
her
on
occasions
even
tender
he
seemed
to
show
for
short
hours
a
trace
of
that
old
quality
of
understanding
too
well
to
blame
that
quality
which
was
the
best
of
him
and
had
worked
swiftly
and
ceaselessly
toward
his
ruin
but
he
hated
to
be
sober
it
made
him
conscious
of
the
people
around
him
of
that
air
of
struggle
of
greedy
ambition
of
hope
more
sordid
than
despair
of
incessant
passage
up
or
down
which
in
every
metropolis
is
most
in
evidence
through
the
unstable
middle
class
unable
to
live
with
the
rich
he
thought
that
his
next
choice
would
have
been
to
live
with
the
very
poor
anything
was
better
than
this
cup
of
perspiration
and
tears
the
sense
of
the
enormous
panorama
of
life
never
strong
in
anthony
had
become
dim
almost
to
extinction
at
long
intervals
now
some
incident
some
gesture
of
gloria
would
take
his
fancy
but
the
gray
veils
had
come
down
in
earnest
upon
him
as
he
grew
older
those
things
faded
after
that
there
was
wine
there
was
a
kindliness
about
intoxication
there
was
that
indescribable
gloss
and
glamour
it
gave
like
the
memories
of
ephemeral
and
faded
evenings
after
a
few
there
was
magic
in
the
tall
glowing
arabian
night
of
the
bush
terminal
building
its
summit
a
peak
of
sheer
grandeur
gold
and
dreaming
against
the
inaccessible
sky
and
wall
street
the
crass
the
banal
again
it
was
the
triumph
of
gold
a
gorgeous
sentient
spectacle
it
was
where
the
great
kings
kept
the
money
for
their
wars
the
fruit
of
youth
or
of
the
grape
the
transitory
magic
of
the
brief
passage
from
darkness
to
darkness
the
old
illusion
that
truth
and
beauty
were
in
some
way
entwined
as
he
stood
in
front
of
delmonico
lighting
a
cigarette
one
night
he
saw
two
hansoms
drawn
up
close
to
the
curb
waiting
for
a
chance
drunken
fare
the
outmoded
cabs
were
worn
and
dirty
the
cracked
patent
leather
wrinkled
like
an
old
man
face
the
cushions
faded
to
a
brownish
lavender
the
very
horses
were
ancient
and
weary
and
so
were
the
men
who
sat
aloft
cracking
their
whips
with
a
grotesque
affectation
of
gallantry
a
relic
of
vanished
gaiety
anthony
patch
walked
away
in
a
sudden
fit
of
depression
pondering
the
bitterness
of
such
survivals
there
was
nothing
it
seemed
that
grew
stale
so
soon
as
pleasure
on
street
one
afternoon
he
met
richard
caramel
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
a
prosperous
fattening
richard
caramel
whose
face
was
filling
out
to
match
the
bostonian
brow
just
got
in
this
week
from
the
coast
was
going
to
call
you
up
but
i
did
know
your
new
address
we
moved
richard
caramel
noticed
that
anthony
was
wearing
a
soiled
shirt
that
his
cuffs
were
slightly
but
perceptibly
frayed
that
his
eyes
were
set
in
the
color
of
cigar
smoke
so
i
gathered
he
said
fixing
his
friend
with
his
eye
but
where
and
how
is
gloria
my
god
anthony
i
been
hearing
the
stories
about
you
two
even
out
in
california
and
when
i
get
back
to
new
york
i
find
you
sunk
absolutely
out
of
sight
why
do
you
pull
yourself
together
now
listen
chattered
anthony
unsteadily
i
ca
stand
a
long
lecture
we
lost
money
in
a
dozen
ways
and
naturally
people
have
talked
on
account
of
the
lawsuit
but
the
thing
coming
to
a
final
decision
this
winter
surely
you
talking
so
fast
that
i
ca
understand
you
interrupted
dick
calmly
well
i
said
all
i
going
to
say
snapped
anthony
come
and
see
us
if
you
like
or
do
with
this
he
turned
and
started
to
walk
off
in
the
crowd
but
dick
overtook
him
immediately
and
grasped
his
arm
say
anthony
do
fly
off
the
handle
so
easily
you
know
gloria
my
cousin
and
you
one
of
my
oldest
friends
so
it
natural
for
me
to
be
interested
when
i
hear
that
you
going
to
the
dogs
and
taking
her
with
you
i
do
want
to
be
preached
to
well
then
all
right
how
about
coming
up
to
my
apartment
and
having
a
drink
i
just
got
settled
i
bought
three
cases
of
gordon
gin
from
a
revenue
officer
as
they
walked
along
he
continued
in
a
burst
of
exasperation
and
how
about
your
grandfather
money
you
going
to
get
it
well
answered
anthony
resentfully
that
old
fool
haight
seems
hopeful
especially
because
people
are
tired
of
reformers
right
now
you
know
it
might
make
a
slight
difference
for
instance
if
some
judge
thought
that
adam
patch
made
it
harder
for
him
to
get
liquor
you
ca
do
without
money
said
dick
sententiously
have
you
tried
to
write
any
lately
anthony
shook
his
head
silently
that
funny
said
dick
i
always
thought
that
you
and
maury
would
write
some
day
and
now
he
grown
to
be
a
sort
of
aristocrat
and
you
i
the
bad
example
i
wonder
why
you
probably
think
you
know
suggested
anthony
with
an
effort
at
concentration
the
failure
and
the
success
both
believe
in
their
hearts
that
they
have
accurately
balanced
points
of
view
the
success
because
he
succeeded
and
the
failure
because
he
failed
the
successful
man
tells
his
son
to
profit
by
his
father
good
fortune
and
the
failure
tells
son
to
profit
by
his
father
mistakes
i
do
agree
with
you
said
the
author
of
a
in
france
i
used
to
listen
to
you
and
maury
when
we
were
young
and
i
used
to
be
impressed
because
you
were
so
consistently
cynical
but
now
well
after
all
by
god
which
of
us
three
has
taken
to
the
to
the
intellectual
life
i
do
want
to
sound
vainglorious
but
it
me
and
i
always
believed
that
moral
values
existed
and
i
always
will
well
objected
anthony
who
was
rather
enjoying
himself
even
granting
that
you
know
that
in
practice
life
never
presents
problems
as
clear
cut
does
it
it
does
to
me
there
nothing
i
violate
certain
principles
for
but
how
do
you
know
when
you
violating
them
you
have
to
guess
at
things
just
like
most
people
do
you
have
to
apportion
the
values
when
you
look
back
you
finish
up
the
portrait
then
paint
in
the
details
and
shadows
dick
shook
his
head
with
a
lofty
stubbornness
same
old
futile
cynic
he
said
it
just
a
mode
of
being
sorry
for
yourself
you
do
do
anything
so
nothing
matters
oh
i
quite
capable
of
admitted
anthony
nor
am
i
claiming
that
i
getting
as
much
fun
out
of
life
as
you
are
you
say
at
least
you
used
to
that
happiness
is
the
only
thing
worth
while
in
life
do
you
think
you
any
happier
for
being
a
pessimist
anthony
grunted
savagely
his
pleasure
in
the
conversation
began
to
wane
he
was
nervous
and
craving
for
a
drink
my
golly
he
cried
where
do
you
live
i
ca
keep
walking
forever
your
endurance
is
all
mental
eh
returned
dick
sharply
well
i
live
right
here
he
turned
in
at
the
apartment
house
on
street
and
a
few
minutes
later
they
were
in
a
large
new
room
with
an
open
fireplace
and
four
walls
lined
with
books
a
colored
butler
served
them
gin
rickeys
and
an
hour
vanished
politely
with
the
mellow
shortening
of
their
drinks
and
the
glow
of
a
light
fire
the
arts
are
very
old
said
anthony
after
a
while
with
a
few
glasses
the
tension
of
his
nerves
relaxed
and
he
found
that
he
could
think
again
which
art
all
of
them
poetry
is
dying
first
it
be
absorbed
into
prose
sooner
or
later
for
instance
the
beautiful
word
the
colored
and
glittering
word
and
the
beautiful
simile
belong
in
prose
now
to
get
attention
poetry
has
got
to
strain
for
the
unusual
word
the
harsh
earthy
word
that
never
been
beautiful
before
beauty
as
the
sum
of
several
beautiful
parts
reached
its
apotheosis
in
swinburne
it
ca
go
any
further
except
in
the
novel
perhaps
dick
interrupted
him
impatiently
you
know
these
new
novels
make
me
tired
my
god
everywhere
i
go
some
silly
girl
asks
me
if
i
read
side
of
paradise
are
our
girls
really
like
that
if
it
true
to
life
which
i
do
believe
the
next
generation
is
going
to
the
dogs
i
sick
of
all
this
shoddy
realism
i
think
there
a
place
for
the
romanticist
in
literature
anthony
tried
to
remember
what
he
had
read
lately
of
richard
caramel
there
was
a
in
france
a
novel
called
the
land
of
strong
men
and
several
dozen
short
stories
which
were
even
worse
it
had
become
the
custom
among
young
and
clever
reviewers
to
mention
richard
caramel
with
a
smile
of
scorn
richard
caramel
they
called
him
his
corpse
was
dragged
obscenely
through
every
literary
supplement
he
was
accused
of
making
a
great
fortune
by
writing
trash
for
the
movies
as
the
fashion
in
books
shifted
he
was
becoming
almost
a
byword
of
contempt
while
anthony
was
thinking
this
dick
had
got
to
his
feet
and
seemed
to
be
hesitating
at
an
avowal
i
gathered
quite
a
few
books
he
said
suddenly
so
i
see
i
made
an
exhaustive
collection
of
good
american
stuff
old
and
new
i
do
mean
the
usual
thing
in
fact
most
of
it
modern
he
stepped
to
one
of
the
walls
and
seeing
that
it
was
expected
of
him
anthony
arose
and
followed
look
under
a
printed
tag
he
displayed
six
long
rows
of
books
beautifully
bound
and
obviously
carefully
chosen
and
here
are
the
contemporary
novelists
then
anthony
saw
the
joker
wedged
in
between
mark
twain
and
dreiser
were
eight
strange
and
inappropriate
volumes
the
works
of
richard
caramel
the
demon
lover
true
enough
but
also
seven
others
that
were
execrably
awful
without
sincerity
or
grace
unwillingly
anthony
glanced
at
dick
face
and
caught
a
slight
uncertainty
there
i
put
my
own
books
in
of
course
said
richard
caramel
hastily
though
one
or
two
of
them
are
uneven
i
afraid
i
wrote
a
little
too
fast
when
i
had
that
magazine
contract
but
i
do
believe
in
false
modesty
of
course
some
of
the
critics
have
paid
so
much
attention
to
me
since
i
been
established
but
after
all
it
not
the
critics
that
count
they
just
sheep
for
the
first
time
in
so
long
that
he
could
scarcely
remember
anthony
felt
a
touch
of
the
old
pleasant
contempt
for
his
friend
richard
caramel
continued
my
publishers
you
know
have
been
advertising
me
as
the
thackeray
of
america
because
of
my
new
york
novel
yes
anthony
managed
to
muster
i
suppose
there
a
good
deal
in
what
you
say
he
knew
that
his
contempt
was
unreasonable
he
knew
that
he
would
have
changed
places
with
dick
unhesitatingly
he
himself
had
tried
his
best
to
write
with
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
ah
well
then
can
a
man
disparage
his
so
readily
and
that
night
while
richard
caramel
was
hard
at
toil
with
great
hittings
of
the
wrong
keys
and
screwings
up
of
his
weary
unmatched
eyes
laboring
over
his
trash
far
into
those
cheerless
hours
when
the
fire
dies
down
and
the
head
is
swimming
from
the
effect
of
prolonged
concentration
anthony
abominably
drunk
was
sprawled
across
the
back
seat
of
a
taxi
on
his
way
to
the
flat
on
claremont
avenue
the
beating
as
winter
approached
it
seemed
that
a
sort
of
madness
seized
upon
anthony
he
awoke
in
the
morning
so
nervous
that
gloria
could
feel
him
trembling
in
the
bed
before
he
could
muster
enough
vitality
to
stumble
into
the
pantry
for
a
drink
he
was
intolerable
now
except
under
the
influence
of
liquor
and
as
he
seemed
to
decay
and
coarsen
under
her
eyes
gloria
soul
and
body
shrank
away
from
him
when
he
stayed
out
all
night
as
he
did
several
times
she
not
only
failed
to
be
sorry
but
even
felt
a
measure
of
relief
next
day
he
would
be
faintly
repentant
and
would
remark
in
a
gruff
fashion
that
he
guessed
he
was
drinking
a
little
too
much
for
hours
at
a
time
he
would
sit
in
the
great
armchair
that
had
been
in
his
apartment
lost
in
a
sort
of
stupor
even
his
interest
in
reading
his
favorite
books
seemed
to
have
departed
and
though
an
incessant
bickering
went
on
between
husband
and
wife
the
one
subject
upon
which
they
ever
really
conversed
was
the
progress
of
the
will
case
what
gloria
hoped
in
the
tenebrous
depths
of
her
soul
what
she
expected
that
great
gift
of
money
to
bring
about
is
difficult
to
imagine
she
was
being
bent
by
her
environment
into
a
grotesque
similitude
of
a
housewife
she
who
until
three
years
before
had
never
made
coffee
prepared
sometimes
three
meals
a
day
she
walked
a
great
deal
in
the
afternoons
and
in
the
evenings
she
read
books
magazines
anything
she
found
at
hand
if
now
she
wished
for
a
child
even
a
child
of
the
anthony
who
sought
her
bed
blind
drunk
she
neither
said
so
nor
gave
any
show
or
sign
of
interest
in
children
it
is
doubtful
if
she
could
have
made
it
clear
to
any
one
what
it
was
she
wanted
or
indeed
what
there
was
to
want
a
lonely
lovely
woman
thirty
now
retrenched
behind
some
impregnable
inhibition
born
and
coexistent
with
her
beauty
one
afternoon
when
the
snow
was
dirty
again
along
riverside
drive
gloria
who
had
been
to
the
grocer
entered
the
apartment
to
find
anthony
pacing
the
floor
in
a
state
of
aggravated
nervousness
the
feverish
eyes
he
turned
on
her
were
traced
with
tiny
pink
lines
that
reminded
her
of
rivers
on
a
map
for
a
moment
she
received
the
impression
that
he
was
suddenly
and
definitely
old
have
you
any
money
he
inquired
of
her
precipitately
what
what
do
you
mean
just
what
i
said
money
money
ca
you
speak
english
she
paid
no
attention
but
brushed
by
him
and
into
the
pantry
to
put
the
bacon
and
eggs
in
the
when
his
drinking
had
been
unusually
excessive
he
was
invariably
in
a
whining
mood
this
time
he
followed
her
and
standing
in
the
pantry
door
persisted
in
his
question
you
heard
what
i
said
have
you
any
money
she
turned
about
from
the
and
faced
him
why
anthony
you
must
be
crazy
you
know
i
have
any
money
except
a
dollar
in
change
he
executed
an
abrupt
and
returned
to
the
living
room
where
he
renewed
his
pacing
it
was
evident
that
he
had
something
portentous
on
his
mind
he
quite
obviously
wanted
to
be
asked
what
was
the
matter
joining
him
a
moment
later
she
sat
upon
the
long
lounge
and
began
taking
down
her
hair
it
was
no
longer
bobbed
and
it
had
changed
in
the
last
year
from
a
rich
gold
dusted
with
red
to
an
unresplendent
light
brown
she
had
bought
some
shampoo
soap
and
meant
to
wash
it
now
she
had
considered
putting
a
bottle
of
peroxide
into
the
rinsing
well
she
implied
silently
that
darn
bank
he
quavered
they
had
my
account
for
over
ten
years
ten
well
it
seems
they
got
some
autocratic
rule
that
you
have
to
keep
over
five
hundred
dollars
there
or
they
wo
carry
you
they
wrote
me
a
letter
a
few
months
ago
and
told
me
i
been
running
too
low
once
i
gave
out
two
bum
checks
remember
that
night
in
reisenweber
but
i
made
them
good
the
very
next
day
well
i
promised
old
halloran
he
the
manager
the
greedy
mick
that
i
watch
out
and
i
thought
i
was
going
all
right
i
kept
up
the
stubs
in
my
pretty
regular
well
i
went
in
there
to
cash
a
check
and
halloran
came
up
and
told
me
they
have
to
close
my
account
too
many
bad
checks
he
said
and
i
never
had
more
than
five
hundred
to
my
credit
and
that
only
for
a
day
or
so
at
a
time
and
by
god
what
do
you
think
he
said
then
what
he
said
this
was
a
good
time
to
do
it
because
i
did
have
a
damn
penny
in
there
you
did
that
what
he
told
me
seems
i
given
these
bedros
people
a
check
for
sixty
for
that
last
case
of
liquor
and
i
only
had
dollars
in
the
bank
well
the
bedros
people
deposited
fifteen
dollars
to
my
account
and
drew
the
whole
thing
out
in
her
ignorance
gloria
conjured
up
a
spectre
of
imprisonment
and
disgrace
oh
they
wo
do
anything
he
assured
her
bootlegging
too
risky
a
business
they
send
me
a
bill
for
fifteen
dollars
and
i
pay
it
oh
she
considered
a
well
we
can
sell
another
bond
he
laughed
sarcastically
oh
yes
that
always
easy
when
the
few
bonds
we
have
that
are
paying
any
interest
at
all
are
only
worth
between
fifty
and
eighty
cents
on
the
dollar
we
lose
about
half
the
bond
every
time
we
sell
what
else
can
we
do
oh
we
sell
something
as
usual
we
got
paper
worth
eighty
thousand
dollars
at
par
again
he
laughed
unpleasantly
bring
about
thirty
thousand
on
the
open
market
i
distrusted
those
ten
per
cent
investments
the
deuce
you
did
he
said
you
pretended
you
did
so
you
could
claw
at
me
if
they
went
to
pieces
but
you
wanted
to
take
a
chance
as
much
as
i
did
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
if
considering
then
anthony
she
cried
suddenly
two
hundred
a
month
is
worse
than
nothing
let
sell
all
the
bonds
and
put
the
thirty
thousand
dollars
in
the
bank
and
if
we
lose
the
case
we
can
live
in
italy
for
three
years
and
then
just
die
in
her
excitement
as
she
talked
she
was
aware
of
a
faint
flush
of
sentiment
the
first
she
had
felt
in
many
days
three
years
he
said
nervously
three
years
you
crazy
haight
take
more
than
that
if
we
lose
do
you
think
he
working
for
charity
i
forgot
that
and
here
it
is
saturday
he
continued
and
i
only
got
a
dollar
and
some
change
and
we
got
to
live
till
monday
when
i
can
get
to
my
broker
and
not
a
drink
in
the
house
he
added
as
a
significant
afterthought
ca
you
call
up
dick
i
did
his
man
says
he
gone
down
to
princeton
to
address
a
literary
club
or
some
such
thing
wo
be
back
till
monday
well
let
see
do
you
know
some
friend
you
might
go
to
i
tried
a
couple
of
fellows
could
find
anybody
in
i
wish
i
sold
that
keats
letter
like
i
started
to
last
week
how
about
those
men
you
play
cards
with
in
that
sammy
place
do
you
think
i
ask
his
voice
rang
with
righteous
horror
gloria
winced
he
would
rather
contemplate
her
active
discomfort
than
feel
his
own
skin
crawl
at
asking
an
inappropriate
favor
i
thought
of
muriel
he
suggested
she
in
california
well
how
about
some
of
those
men
who
gave
you
such
a
good
time
while
i
was
in
the
army
you
think
they
might
be
glad
to
do
a
little
favor
for
you
she
looked
at
him
contemptuously
but
he
took
no
notice
or
how
about
your
old
friend
rachael
or
constance
merriam
constance
merriam
been
dead
a
year
and
i
would
ask
rachael
well
how
about
that
gentleman
who
was
so
anxious
to
help
you
once
that
he
could
hardly
restrain
himself
bloeckman
oh
he
had
hurt
her
at
last
and
he
was
not
too
obtuse
or
too
careless
to
perceive
it
why
not
him
he
insisted
callously
because
he
does
like
me
any
more
she
said
with
difficulty
and
then
as
he
did
not
answer
but
only
regarded
her
cynically
if
you
want
to
know
why
i
tell
you
a
year
ago
i
went
to
bloeckman
he
changed
his
name
to
black
and
asked
him
to
put
me
into
pictures
you
went
to
bloeckman
yes
why
did
you
tell
me
he
demanded
incredulously
the
smile
fading
from
his
face
because
you
were
probably
off
drinking
somewhere
he
had
them
give
me
a
test
and
they
decided
that
i
was
young
enough
for
anything
except
a
character
part
a
character
part
the
of
thirty
sort
of
thing
i
was
thirty
and
i
think
i
looked
thirty
why
damn
him
cried
anthony
championing
her
violently
with
a
curious
perverseness
of
emotion
why
well
that
why
i
ca
go
to
him
why
the
insolence
insisted
anthony
nervously
the
insolence
anthony
that
does
matter
now
the
thing
is
we
got
to
live
over
sunday
and
there
nothing
in
the
house
but
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
of
bacon
and
two
eggs
for
breakfast
she
handed
him
the
contents
of
her
purse
there
seventy
eighty
a
dollar
fifteen
with
what
you
have
that
makes
about
two
and
a
half
altogether
does
it
anthony
we
can
get
along
on
that
we
can
buy
lots
of
food
with
that
more
than
we
can
possibly
eat
jingling
the
change
in
his
hand
he
shook
his
head
no
i
got
to
have
a
drink
i
so
darn
nervous
that
i
shivering
a
thought
struck
him
perhaps
sammy
cash
a
check
and
then
monday
i
could
rush
down
to
the
bank
with
the
money
but
they
closed
your
account
that
right
that
right
i
forgotten
i
tell
you
what
i
go
down
to
sammy
and
i
find
somebody
there
who
lend
me
something
i
hate
like
the
devil
to
ask
them
though
he
snapped
his
fingers
suddenly
i
know
what
i
do
i
hock
my
watch
i
can
get
twenty
dollars
on
it
and
get
it
back
monday
for
sixty
cents
extra
it
been
hocked
before
when
i
was
at
cambridge
he
had
put
on
his
overcoat
and
with
a
brief
he
started
down
the
hall
toward
the
outer
door
gloria
got
to
her
feet
it
had
suddenly
occurred
to
her
where
he
would
probably
go
first
anthony
she
called
after
him
had
you
better
leave
two
dollars
with
me
you
only
need
the
outer
door
slammed
he
had
pretended
not
to
hear
her
she
stood
for
a
moment
looking
after
him
then
she
went
into
the
bathroom
among
her
tragic
unguents
and
began
preparations
for
washing
her
hair
down
at
sammy
he
found
parker
allison
and
pete
lytell
sitting
alone
at
a
table
drinking
whiskey
sours
it
was
just
after
six
and
sammy
or
samuele
bendiri
as
he
had
been
christened
was
sweeping
an
accumulation
of
cigarette
butts
and
broken
glass
into
a
corner
hi
tony
called
parker
allison
to
anthony
sometimes
he
addressed
him
as
tony
at
other
times
it
was
dan
to
him
all
anthonys
must
sail
under
one
of
these
diminutives
sit
down
what
you
have
on
the
subway
anthony
had
counted
his
money
and
found
that
he
had
almost
four
dollars
he
could
pay
for
two
rounds
at
fifty
cents
a
drink
which
meant
that
he
would
have
six
drinks
then
he
would
go
over
to
sixth
avenue
and
get
twenty
dollars
and
a
pawn
ticket
in
exchange
for
his
watch
well
roughnecks
he
said
jovially
how
the
life
of
crime
pretty
good
said
allison
he
winked
at
pete
lytell
too
bad
you
a
married
man
we
got
some
pretty
good
stuff
lined
up
for
about
eleven
when
the
shows
let
out
oh
boy
yes
sir
too
bad
married
is
it
pete
shame
at
half
past
seven
when
they
had
completed
the
six
rounds
anthony
found
that
his
intentions
were
giving
audience
to
his
desires
he
was
happy
and
cheerful
now
thoroughly
enjoying
himself
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
story
which
pete
had
just
finished
telling
was
unusually
and
profoundly
humorous
and
he
decided
as
he
did
every
day
at
about
this
point
that
they
were
damn
good
fellows
by
golly
who
would
do
a
lot
more
for
him
than
any
one
else
he
knew
the
pawnshops
would
remain
open
until
late
saturday
nights
and
he
felt
that
if
he
took
just
one
more
drink
he
would
attain
a
gorgeous
exhilaration
artfully
he
fished
in
his
vest
pockets
brought
up
his
two
quarters
and
stared
at
them
as
though
in
surprise
well
i
be
darned
he
protested
in
an
aggrieved
tone
here
come
out
without
my
pocketbook
need
some
cash
asked
lytell
easily
i
left
my
money
on
the
dresser
at
home
and
i
wanted
to
buy
you
another
drink
oh
knock
it
lytell
waved
the
suggestion
away
disparagingly
i
guess
we
can
blow
a
good
fella
to
all
the
drinks
he
wants
what
you
have
same
i
tell
you
suggested
parker
allison
suppose
we
send
sammy
across
the
street
for
some
sandwiches
and
eat
dinner
here
the
other
two
agreed
good
idea
hey
sammy
wantcha
do
somep
for
us
just
after
nine
anthony
staggered
to
his
feet
and
bidding
them
a
thick
good
night
walked
unsteadily
to
the
door
handing
sammy
one
of
his
two
quarters
as
he
passed
out
once
in
the
street
he
hesitated
uncertainly
and
then
started
in
the
direction
of
sixth
avenue
where
he
remembered
to
have
frequently
passed
several
loan
offices
he
went
by
a
and
two
and
then
he
realized
that
he
was
standing
in
front
of
the
place
which
he
sought
and
that
it
was
shut
and
barred
unperturbed
he
continued
another
one
half
a
block
down
was
also
closed
so
were
two
more
across
the
street
and
a
fifth
in
the
square
below
seeing
a
faint
light
in
the
last
one
he
began
to
knock
on
the
glass
door
he
desisted
only
when
a
watchman
appeared
in
the
back
of
the
shop
and
motioned
him
angrily
to
move
on
with
growing
discouragement
with
growing
befuddlement
he
crossed
the
street
and
walked
back
toward
on
the
corner
near
sammy
he
paused
undecided
if
he
went
back
to
the
apartment
as
he
felt
his
body
required
he
would
lay
himself
open
to
bitter
reproach
yet
now
that
the
pawnshops
were
closed
he
had
no
notion
where
to
get
the
money
he
decided
finally
that
he
might
ask
parker
allison
after
all
but
he
approached
sammy
only
to
find
the
door
locked
and
the
lights
out
he
looked
at
his
watch
he
began
walking
ten
minutes
later
he
stopped
aimlessly
at
the
corner
of
street
and
madison
avenue
diagonally
across
from
the
bright
but
nearly
deserted
entrance
to
the
biltmore
hotel
here
he
stood
for
a
moment
and
then
sat
down
heavily
on
a
damp
board
amid
some
debris
of
construction
work
he
rested
there
for
almost
half
an
hour
his
mind
a
shifting
pattern
of
surface
thoughts
chiefest
among
which
were
that
he
must
obtain
some
money
and
get
home
before
he
became
too
sodden
to
find
his
way
then
glancing
over
toward
the
biltmore
he
saw
a
man
standing
directly
under
the
overhead
glow
of
the
lamps
beside
a
woman
in
an
ermine
coat
as
anthony
watched
the
couple
moved
forward
and
signalled
to
a
taxi
anthony
perceived
by
the
infallible
identification
that
lurks
in
the
walk
of
a
friend
that
it
was
maury
noble
he
rose
to
his
feet
maury
he
shouted
maury
looked
in
his
direction
then
turned
back
to
the
girl
just
as
the
taxi
came
up
into
place
with
the
chaotic
idea
of
borrowing
ten
dollars
anthony
began
to
run
as
fast
as
he
could
across
madison
avenue
and
along
street
as
he
came
up
maury
was
standing
beside
the
yawning
door
of
the
taxicab
his
companion
turned
and
looked
curiously
at
anthony
hello
maury
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
how
are
you
fine
thank
you
their
hands
dropped
and
anthony
hesitated
maury
made
no
move
to
introduce
him
but
only
stood
there
regarding
him
with
an
inscrutable
feline
silence
i
wanted
to
see
you
began
anthony
uncertainly
he
did
not
feel
that
he
could
ask
for
a
loan
with
the
girl
not
four
feet
away
so
he
broke
off
and
made
a
perceptible
motion
of
his
head
as
if
to
beckon
maury
to
one
side
i
in
rather
a
big
hurry
anthony
i
know
but
can
you
can
you
again
he
hesitated
i
see
you
some
other
time
said
maury
it
important
i
sorry
anthony
before
anthony
could
make
up
his
mind
to
blurt
out
his
request
maury
had
turned
coolly
to
the
girl
helped
her
into
the
car
and
with
a
polite
good
evening
stepped
in
after
her
as
he
nodded
from
the
window
it
seemed
to
anthony
that
his
expression
had
not
changed
by
a
shade
or
a
hair
then
with
a
fretful
clatter
the
taxi
moved
off
and
anthony
was
left
standing
there
alone
under
the
lights
anthony
went
on
into
the
biltmore
for
no
reason
in
particular
except
that
the
entrance
was
at
hand
and
ascending
the
wide
stair
found
a
seat
in
an
alcove
he
was
furiously
aware
that
he
had
been
snubbed
he
was
as
hurt
and
angry
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
be
when
in
that
condition
nevertheless
he
was
stubbornly
preoccupied
with
the
necessity
of
obtaining
some
money
before
he
went
home
and
once
again
he
told
over
on
his
fingers
the
acquaintances
he
might
conceivably
call
on
in
this
emergency
he
thought
eventually
that
he
might
approach
howland
his
broker
at
his
home
after
a
long
wait
he
found
that
howland
was
out
he
returned
to
the
operator
leaning
over
her
desk
and
fingering
his
quarter
as
though
loath
to
leave
unsatisfied
call
bloeckman
he
said
suddenly
his
own
words
surprised
him
the
name
had
come
from
some
crossing
of
two
suggestions
in
his
mind
what
the
number
please
scarcely
conscious
of
what
he
did
anthony
looked
up
joseph
bloeckman
in
the
telephone
directory
he
could
find
no
such
person
and
was
about
to
close
the
book
when
it
flashed
into
his
mind
that
gloria
had
mentioned
a
change
of
name
it
was
the
matter
of
a
minute
to
find
joseph
black
then
he
waited
in
the
booth
while
central
called
the
number
bloeckman
i
mean
black
in
no
he
out
this
evening
is
there
any
message
the
intonation
was
cockney
it
reminded
him
of
the
rich
vocal
deferences
of
bounds
where
is
he
why
ah
who
is
this
please
sir
this
patch
matter
of
importance
why
he
with
a
party
at
the
boul
mich
sir
thanks
anthony
got
his
five
cents
change
and
started
for
the
boul
mich
a
popular
dancing
resort
on
street
it
was
nearly
ten
but
the
streets
were
dark
and
sparsely
peopled
until
the
theatres
should
eject
their
spawn
an
hour
later
anthony
knew
the
boul
mich
for
he
had
been
there
with
gloria
during
the
year
before
and
he
remembered
the
existence
of
a
rule
that
patrons
must
be
in
evening
dress
well
he
would
not
go
he
would
send
a
boy
up
for
bloeckman
and
wait
for
him
in
the
lower
hall
for
a
moment
he
did
not
doubt
that
the
whole
project
was
entirely
natural
and
graceful
to
his
distorted
imagination
bloeckman
had
become
simply
one
of
his
old
friends
the
entrance
hall
of
the
boul
mich
was
warm
there
were
high
yellow
lights
over
a
thick
green
carpet
from
the
centre
of
which
a
white
stairway
rose
to
the
dancing
floor
anthony
spoke
to
the
hallboy
i
want
to
see
bloeckman
black
he
said
he
have
him
paged
the
boy
shook
his
head
rules
to
have
him
paged
you
know
what
table
he
at
no
but
i
got
see
him
wait
an
i
getcha
waiter
after
a
short
interval
a
head
waiter
appeared
bearing
a
card
on
which
were
charted
the
table
reservations
he
darted
a
cynical
look
at
anthony
which
however
failed
of
its
target
together
they
bent
over
the
cardboard
and
found
the
table
without
difficulty
a
party
of
eight
black
own
tell
him
patch
very
very
important
again
he
waited
leaning
against
the
banister
and
listening
to
the
confused
harmonies
of
which
came
floating
down
the
stairs
a
near
him
was
singing
out
in
the
shimmee
sanitarium
the
nuts
reside
out
in
the
shimmee
sanitarium
i
left
my
blushing
bride
she
went
and
shook
herself
insane
so
let
her
shiver
back
again
then
he
saw
bloeckman
descending
the
staircase
and
took
a
step
forward
to
meet
him
and
shake
hands
you
wanted
to
see
me
said
the
older
man
coolly
yes
answered
anthony
nodding
personal
matter
can
you
jus
step
over
here
regarding
him
narrowly
bloeckman
followed
anthony
to
a
half
bend
made
by
the
staircase
where
they
were
beyond
observation
or
earshot
of
any
one
entering
or
leaving
the
restaurant
well
he
inquired
wanted
talk
to
you
what
about
anthony
only
laughed
a
silly
laugh
he
intended
it
to
sound
casual
what
do
you
want
to
talk
to
me
about
repeated
bloeckman
wha
hurry
old
man
he
tried
to
lay
his
hand
in
a
friendly
gesture
upon
bloeckman
shoulder
but
the
latter
drew
away
slightly
how
been
very
well
thanks
see
here
patch
i
got
a
party
they
think
it
rude
if
i
stay
away
too
long
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
see
me
about
for
the
second
time
that
evening
anthony
mind
made
an
abrupt
jump
and
what
he
said
was
not
at
all
what
he
had
intended
to
say
you
kep
my
wife
out
of
the
movies
what
bloeckman
ruddy
face
darkened
in
parallel
planes
of
shadows
you
heard
me
look
here
patch
said
bloeckman
evenly
and
without
changing
his
expression
you
drunk
you
disgustingly
and
insultingly
drunk
not
too
drunk
talk
to
you
insisted
anthony
with
a
leer
firs
place
my
wife
wants
nothin
whatever
do
with
you
never
did
me
be
quiet
said
the
older
man
angrily
i
should
think
you
respect
your
wife
enough
not
to
bring
her
into
the
conversation
under
these
circumstances
never
you
min
how
i
expect
my
wife
one
thing
you
leave
her
alone
you
go
to
hell
see
here
i
think
you
a
little
crazy
exclaimed
bloeckman
he
took
two
paces
forward
as
though
to
pass
by
but
anthony
stepped
in
his
way
not
so
fas
you
goddam
jew
for
a
moment
they
stood
regarding
each
other
anthony
swaying
gently
from
side
to
side
bloeckman
almost
trembling
with
fury
be
careful
he
cried
in
a
strained
voice
anthony
might
have
remembered
then
a
certain
look
bloeckman
had
given
him
in
the
biltmore
hotel
years
before
but
he
remembered
nothing
nothing
i
say
it
again
you
god
then
bloeckman
struck
out
with
all
the
strength
in
the
arm
of
a
man
of
struck
out
and
caught
anthony
squarely
in
the
mouth
anthony
cracked
up
against
the
staircase
recovered
himself
and
made
a
wild
drunken
swing
at
his
opponent
but
bloeckman
who
took
exercise
every
day
and
knew
something
of
sparring
blocked
it
with
ease
and
struck
him
twice
in
the
face
with
two
swift
smashing
jabs
anthony
gave
a
little
grunt
and
toppled
over
onto
the
green
plush
carpet
finding
as
he
fell
that
his
mouth
was
full
of
blood
and
seemed
oddly
loose
in
front
he
struggled
to
his
feet
panting
and
spitting
and
then
as
he
started
toward
bloeckman
who
stood
a
few
feet
away
his
fists
clenched
but
not
up
two
waiters
who
had
appeared
from
nowhere
seized
his
arms
and
held
him
helpless
in
back
of
them
a
dozen
people
had
miraculously
gathered
i
kill
him
cried
anthony
pitching
and
straining
from
side
to
side
let
me
kill
throw
him
out
ordered
bloeckman
excitedly
just
as
a
small
man
with
a
pockmarked
face
pushed
his
way
hurriedly
through
the
spectators
any
trouble
mr
black
this
bum
tried
to
blackmail
me
said
bloeckman
and
then
his
voice
rising
to
a
faintly
shrill
note
of
pride
he
got
what
was
coming
to
him
the
little
man
turned
to
a
waiter
call
a
policeman
he
commanded
oh
no
said
bloeckman
quickly
i
ca
be
bothered
just
throw
him
out
in
the
street
ugh
what
an
outrage
he
turned
and
with
conscious
dignity
walked
toward
the
just
as
six
brawny
hands
seized
upon
anthony
and
dragged
him
toward
the
door
the
bum
was
propelled
violently
to
the
sidewalk
where
he
landed
on
his
hands
and
knees
with
a
grotesque
slapping
sound
and
rolled
over
slowly
onto
his
side
the
shock
stunned
him
he
lay
there
for
a
moment
in
acute
distributed
pain
then
his
discomfort
became
centralized
in
his
stomach
and
he
regained
consciousness
to
discover
that
a
large
foot
was
prodding
him
you
got
to
move
on
y
bum
move
on
it
was
the
bulky
doorman
speaking
a
town
car
had
stopped
at
the
curb
and
its
occupants
had
disembarked
that
is
two
of
the
women
were
standing
on
the
dashboard
waiting
in
offended
delicacy
until
this
obscene
obstacle
should
be
removed
from
their
path
move
on
or
else
i
here
i
get
him
this
was
a
new
voice
anthony
imagined
that
it
was
somehow
more
tolerant
better
disposed
than
the
first
again
arms
were
about
him
half
lifting
half
dragging
him
into
a
welcome
shadow
four
doors
up
the
street
and
propping
him
against
the
stone
front
of
a
millinery
shop
much
obliged
muttered
anthony
feebly
some
one
pushed
his
soft
hat
down
upon
his
head
and
he
winced
just
sit
still
buddy
and
you
feel
better
those
guys
sure
give
you
a
bump
i
going
back
and
kill
that
dirty
he
tried
to
get
to
his
feet
but
collapsed
backward
against
the
wall
you
ca
do
nothin

the
voice
get
some
other
time
i
tellin

anthony
nodded
an
you
better
go
home
you
dropped
a
tooth
buddy
you
know
that
anthony
explored
his
mouth
with
his
tongue
verifying
the
statement
then
with
an
effort
he
raised
his
hand
and
located
the
gap
i
agoin
to
get
you
home
friend
whereabouts
do
you
live
oh

god

interrupted
anthony
clenching
his
fists
passionately
i

and
fix
it
with
you
my
grandfather

the
way
to
tarrytown
no
well
you
tell
me
where
to
go
friend
and
i
get
a
cab
anthony
made
out
that
his
samaritan
was
a
short
individual
somewhat
the
worse
for
wear
where
live
hey
sodden
and
shaken
as
he
was
anthony
felt
that
his
address
would
be
poor
collateral
for
his
wild
boast
about
his
grandfather
get
me
a
cab
he
commanded
feeling
in
his
pockets
a
taxi
drove
up
again
anthony
essayed
to
rise
but
his
ankle
swung
loose
as
though
it
were
in
two
sections
the
samaritan
must
needs
help
him
in
and
climb
in
after
him
see
here
fella
said
he
you
soused
and
you
bunged
up
and
you
wo
be
able
to
get
in
your
house
somebody
carries
you
in
so
going
with
you
and
i
know
you
make
it
all
right
with
me
where
live
with
some
reluctance
anthony
gave
his
address
then
as
the
cab
moved
off
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
man
shoulder
and
went
into
a
shadowy
painful
torpor
when
he
awoke
the
man
had
lifted
him
from
the
cab
in
front
of
the
apartment
on
claremont
avenue
and
was
trying
to
set
him
on
his
feet
can
y
walk
yes
sort
of
you
better
not
come
in
with
me
again
he
felt
helplessly
in
his
pockets
say
he
continued
apologetically
swaying
dangerously
on
his
feet
i
afraid
i
have
got
a
cent
huh
i
cleaned
out
did
i
hear
you
promise
you
fix
it
with
me
who
goin
to
pay
the
taxi
bill
he
turned
to
the
driver
for
confirmation
you
hear
him
say
he
fix
it
all
that
about
his
grandfather
matter
of
fact
muttered
anthony
imprudently
it
was
you
did
all
the
talking
however
if
you
come
round
at
this
point
the
leaned
from
his
cab
and
said
ferociously
ah
poke
him
one
the
dirty
cheap
skate
if
he
was
a
bum
they
throwed
him
out
in
answer
to
this
suggestion
the
fist
of
the
samaritan
shot
out
like
a
and
sent
anthony
crashing
down
against
the
stone
steps
of
the
where
he
lay
without
movement
while
the
tall
buildings
rocked
to
and
fro
above
him
after
a
long
while
he
awoke
and
was
conscious
that
it
had
grown
much
colder
he
tried
to
move
himself
but
his
muscles
refused
to
function
he
was
curiously
anxious
to
know
the
time
but
he
reached
for
his
watch
only
to
find
the
pocket
empty
involuntarily
his
lips
formed
an
immemorial
phrase
what
a
night
strangely
enough
he
was
almost
sober
without
moving
his
head
he
looked
up
to
where
the
moon
was
anchored
in
shedding
light
down
into
claremont
avenue
as
into
the
bottom
of
a
deep
and
uncharted
abyss
there
was
no
sign
or
sound
of
life
save
for
the
continuous
buzzing
in
his
own
ears
but
after
a
moment
anthony
himself
broke
the
silence
with
a
distinct
and
peculiar
murmur
it
was
the
sound
that
he
had
consistently
attempted
to
make
back
there
in
the
boul
mich
when
he
had
been
face
to
face
with
bloeckman
the
unmistakable
sound
of
ironic
laughter
and
on
his
torn
and
bleeding
lips
it
was
like
a
pitiful
retching
of
the
soul
three
weeks
later
the
trial
came
to
an
end
the
seemingly
endless
spool
of
legal
red
tape
having
unrolled
over
a
period
of
four
and
a
half
years
suddenly
snapped
off
anthony
and
gloria
and
on
the
other
side
edward
shuttleworth
and
a
platoon
of
beneficiaries
testified
and
lied
and
generally
in
varying
degrees
of
greed
and
desperation
anthony
awoke
one
morning
in
march
realizing
that
the
verdict
was
to
be
given
at
four
that
afternoon
and
at
the
thought
he
got
up
out
of
his
bed
and
began
to
dress
with
his
extreme
nervousness
there
was
mingled
an
unjustified
optimism
as
to
the
outcome
he
believed
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
would
be
reversed
if
only
because
of
the
reaction
due
to
excessive
prohibition
that
had
recently
set
in
against
reforms
and
reformers
he
counted
more
on
the
personal
attacks
that
they
had
levelled
at
shuttleworth
than
on
the
more
sheerly
legal
aspects
of
the
proceedings
dressed
he
poured
himself
a
drink
of
whiskey
and
then
went
into
gloria
room
where
he
found
her
already
wide
awake
she
had
been
in
bed
for
a
week
humoring
herself
anthony
fancied
though
the
doctor
had
said
that
she
had
best
not
be
disturbed
good
morning
she
murmured
without
smiling
her
eyes
seemed
unusually
large
and
dark
how
do
you
feel
he
asked
grudgingly
better
yes
much
yes
do
you
feel
well
enough
to
go
down
to
court
with
me
this
afternoon
she
nodded
yes
i
want
to
dick
said
yesterday
that
if
the
weather
was
nice
he
was
coming
up
in
his
car
and
take
me
for
a
ride
in
central
park
and
look
the
room
all
full
of
sunshine
anthony
glanced
mechanically
out
the
window
and
then
sat
down
upon
the
bed
god
i
nervous
he
exclaimed
please
do
sit
there
she
said
quickly
why
not
you
smell
of
whiskey
i
ca
stand
it
he
got
up
and
left
the
room
a
little
later
she
called
to
him
and
he
went
out
and
brought
her
some
potato
salad
and
cold
chicken
from
the
delicatessen
at
two
richard
caramel
car
arrived
at
the
door
and
when
he
phoned
up
anthony
took
gloria
down
in
the
elevator
and
walked
with
her
to
the
curb
she
told
her
cousin
that
it
was
sweet
of
him
to
take
her
riding
be
simple
dick
replied
disparagingly
it
nothing
but
he
did
not
mean
that
it
was
nothing
and
this
was
a
curious
thing
richard
caramel
had
forgiven
many
people
for
many
offenses
but
he
had
never
forgiven
his
cousin
gloria
gilbert
for
a
statement
she
had
made
just
prior
to
her
wedding
seven
years
before
she
had
said
that
she
did
not
intend
to
read
his
book
richard
caramel
remembered
this
he
had
remembered
it
well
for
seven
years
what
time
will
i
expect
you
back
asked
anthony
we
wo
come
back
she
answered
we
meet
you
down
there
at
four
all
right
he
muttered
i
meet
you
he
found
a
letter
waiting
for
him
it
was
a
mimeographed
notice
urging
the
boys
in
condescendingly
colloquial
language
to
pay
the
dues
of
the
american
legion
he
threw
it
impatiently
into
the
and
sat
down
with
his
elbows
on
the
window
sill
looking
down
blindly
into
the
sunny
street
italy
if
the
verdict
was
in
their
favor
it
meant
italy
the
word
had
become
a
sort
of
talisman
to
him
a
land
where
the
intolerable
anxieties
of
life
would
fall
away
like
an
old
garment
they
would
go
to
the
first
and
among
the
bright
and
colorful
crowds
forget
the
gray
appendages
of
despair
marvellously
renewed
he
would
walk
again
in
the
piazza
di
spanga
at
twilight
moving
in
that
drifting
flotsam
of
dark
women
and
ragged
beggars
of
austere
barefooted
friars
the
thought
of
italian
women
stirred
him
faintly
when
his
purse
hung
heavy
again
even
romance
might
fly
back
to
perch
upon
it
the
romance
of
blue
canals
in
venice
of
the
golden
green
hills
of
fiesole
after
rain
and
of
women
women
who
changed
dissolved
melted
into
other
women
and
receded
from
his
life
but
who
were
always
beautiful
and
always
young
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
should
be
a
difference
in
his
attitude
all
the
distress
that
he
had
ever
known
the
sorrow
and
the
pain
had
been
because
of
women
it
was
something
that
in
different
ways
they
did
to
him
unconsciously
almost
casually
perhaps
finding
him
and
afraid
they
killed
the
things
in
him
that
menaced
their
absolute
sway
turning
about
from
the
window
he
faced
his
reflection
in
the
mirror
contemplating
dejectedly
the
wan
pasty
face
the
eyes
with
their
crisscross
of
lines
like
shreds
of
dried
blood
the
stooped
and
flabby
figure
whose
very
sag
was
a
document
in
lethargy
he
was
thirty
three
he
looked
forty
well
things
would
be
different
the
rang
abruptly
and
he
started
as
though
he
had
been
dealt
a
blow
recovering
himself
he
went
into
the
hall
and
opened
the
outer
door
it
was
dot
the
encounter
he
retreated
before
her
into
the
living
room
comprehending
only
a
word
here
and
there
in
the
slow
flood
of
sentences
that
poured
from
her
steadily
one
after
the
other
in
a
persistent
monotone
she
was
decently
and
shabbily
dressed
a
somehow
pitiable
little
hat
adorned
with
pink
and
blue
flowers
covered
and
hid
her
dark
hair
he
gathered
from
her
words
that
several
days
before
she
had
seen
an
item
in
the
paper
concerning
the
lawsuit
and
had
obtained
his
address
from
the
clerk
of
the
appellate
division
she
had
called
up
the
apartment
and
had
been
told
that
anthony
was
out
by
a
woman
to
whom
she
had
refused
to
give
her
name
in
a
living
room
he
stood
by
the
door
regarding
her
with
a
sort
of
stupefied
horror
as
she
rattled
on
his
predominant
sensation
was
that
all
the
civilization
and
convention
around
him
was
curiously
unreal
she
was
in
a
milliner
shop
on
sixth
avenue
she
said
it
was
a
lonesome
life
she
had
been
sick
for
a
long
while
after
he
left
for
camp
mills
her
mother
had
come
down
and
taken
her
home
again
to
carolina
she
had
come
to
new
york
with
the
idea
of
finding
anthony
she
was
appallingly
in
earnest
her
violet
eyes
were
red
with
tears
her
soft
intonation
was
ragged
with
little
gasping
sobs
that
was
all
she
had
never
changed
she
wanted
him
now
and
if
she
could
have
him
she
must
die
you
have
to
get
out
he
said
at
length
speaking
with
tortuous
intensity
have
i
enough
to
worry
me
now
without
you
coming
here
my
you
have
to
get
sobbing
she
sat
down
in
a
chair
i
love
you
she
cried
i
do
care
what
you
say
to
me
i
love
you
i
do
care
he
almost
shrieked
get
out
oh
get
out
have
you
done
me
harm
enough
have
you
done
hit
me
she
implored
him
wildly
stupidly
oh
hit
me
and
i
kiss
the
hand
you
hit
me
with
his
voice
rose
until
it
was
pitched
almost
at
a
scream
i
kill
you
he
cried
if
you
do
get
out
i
kill
you
i
kill
you
there
was
madness
in
his
eyes
now
but
unintimidated
dot
rose
and
took
a
step
toward
him
anthony
anthony
he
made
a
little
clicking
sound
with
his
teeth
and
drew
back
as
though
to
spring
at
her
then
changing
his
purpose
he
looked
wildly
about
him
on
the
floor
and
wall
i
kill
you
he
was
muttering
in
short
broken
gasps
i
you
he
seemed
to
bite
at
the
word
as
though
to
force
it
into
materialization
alarmed
at
last
she
made
no
further
movement
forward
but
meeting
his
frantic
eyes
took
a
step
back
toward
the
door
anthony
began
to
race
here
and
there
on
his
side
of
the
room
still
giving
out
his
single
cursing
cry
then
he
found
what
he
had
been
seeking
a
stiff
oaken
chair
that
stood
beside
the
table
uttering
a
harsh
broken
shout
he
seized
it
swung
it
above
his
head
and
let
it
go
with
all
his
raging
strength
straight
at
the
white
frightened
face
across
the
room
then
a
thick
impenetrable
darkness
came
down
upon
him
and
blotted
out
thought
rage
and
madness
together
with
almost
a
tangible
snapping
sound
the
face
of
the
world
changed
before
his
eyes
gloria
and
dick
came
in
at
five
and
called
his
name
there
was
no
answer
they
went
into
the
living
room
and
found
a
chair
with
its
back
smashed
lying
in
the
doorway
and
they
noticed
that
all
about
the
room
there
was
a
sort
of
disorder
the
rugs
had
slid
the
pictures
and
were
upset
upon
the
centre
table
the
air
was
sickly
sweet
with
cheap
perfume
they
found
anthony
sitting
in
a
patch
of
sunshine
on
the
floor
of
his
bedroom
before
him
open
were
spread
his
three
big
and
when
they
entered
he
was
running
his
hands
through
a
great
pile
of
stamps
that
he
had
dumped
from
the
back
of
one
of
them
looking
up
and
seeing
dick
and
gloria
he
put
his
head
critically
on
one
side
and
motioned
them
back
anthony
cried
gloria
tensely
we
won
they
reversed
the
decision
do
come
in
he
murmured
wanly
you
muss
them
i
sorting
and
i
know
you
step
in
them
everything
always
gets
mussed
what
are
you
doing
demanded
dick
in
astonishment
going
back
to
childhood
do
you
realize
you
won
the
suit
they
reversed
the
decision
of
the
lower
courts
you
worth
thirty
millions
anthony
only
looked
at
him
reproachfully
shut
the
door
when
you
go
out
he
spoke
like
a
pert
child
with
a
faint
horror
dawning
in
her
eyes
gloria
gazed
at
him
anthony
she
cried
what
is
it
what
the
matter
why
did
you
come
why
what
it
see
here
said
anthony
softly
you
two
get
out
now
both
of
you
or
else
i
tell
my
grandfather
he
held
up
a
handful
of
stamps
and
let
them
come
drifting
down
about
him
like
leaves
varicolored
and
bright
turning
and
fluttering
gaudily
upon
the
sunny
air
stamps
of
england
and
ecuador
venezuela
and
spain
italy
together
with
the
sparrows
that
exquisite
heavenly
irony
which
has
tabulated
the
demise
of
so
many
generations
of
sparrows
doubtless
records
the
subtlest
verbal
inflections
of
the
passengers
of
such
ships
as
and
doubtless
it
was
listening
when
the
young
man
in
the
plaid
cap
crossed
the
deck
quickly
and
spoke
to
the
pretty
girl
in
yellow
that
him
he
said
pointing
to
a
bundled
figure
seated
in
a
wheel
chair
near
the
rail
that
anthony
patch
first
time
he
been
on
deck
oh
that
him
yes
he
been
a
little
crazy
they
say
ever
since
he
got
his
money
four
or
five
months
ago
you
see
the
other
fellow
shuttleworth
the
religious
fellow
the
one
that
did
get
the
money
he
locked
himself
up
in
a
room
in
a
hotel
and
shot
himself
oh
he
did
but
i
guess
anthony
patch
do
care
much
he
got
his
thirty
million
and
he
got
his
private
physician
along
in
case
he
does
feel
just
right
about
it
has
been
on
deck
he
asked
the
pretty
girl
in
yellow
looked
around
cautiously
she
was
here
a
minute
ago
she
had
on
a
coat
that
must
have
cost
a
small
fortune
she
frowned
and
then
added
decisively
i
ca
stand
her
you
know
she
seems
sort
of
sort
of
dyed
and
if
you
know
what
i
mean
some
people
just
have
that
look
about
them
whether
they
are
or
not
sure
i
know
agreed
the
man
with
the
plaid
cap
she
not
though
he
paused
wonder
what
he
thinking
about
his
money
i
guess
or
maybe
he
got
remorse
about
that
fellow
shuttleworth
probably
but
the
man
in
the
plaid
cap
was
quite
wrong
anthony
patch
sitting
near
the
rail
and
looking
out
at
the
sea
was
not
thinking
of
his
money
for
he
had
seldom
in
his
life
been
really
preoccupied
with
material
vainglory
nor
of
edward
shuttleworth
for
it
is
best
to
look
on
the
sunny
side
of
these
things
no
he
was
concerned
with
a
series
of
reminiscences
much
as
a
general
might
look
back
upon
a
successful
campaign
and
analyze
his
victories
he
was
thinking
of
the
hardships
the
insufferable
tribulations
he
had
gone
through
they
had
tried
to
penalize
him
for
the
mistakes
of
his
youth
he
had
been
exposed
to
ruthless
misery
his
very
craving
for
romance
had
been
punished
his
friends
had
deserted
him
even
gloria
had
turned
against
him
he
had
been
alone
alone
facing
it
all
only
a
few
months
before
people
had
been
urging
him
to
give
in
to
submit
to
mediocrity
to
go
to
work
but
he
had
known
that
he
was
justified
in
his
way
of
life
and
he
had
stuck
it
out
stanchly
why
the
very
friends
who
had
been
most
unkind
had
come
to
respect
him
to
know
he
had
been
right
all
along
had
not
the
lacys
and
the
merediths
and
the
called
on
gloria
and
him
at
the
just
a
week
before
they
sailed
great
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
and
his
voice
was
tremulous
as
he
whispered
to
himself
i
showed
them
he
was
saying
it
was
a
hard
fight
but
i
did
give
up
and
i
came
through
