madame
firmiani
by
honore
de
balzac
translated
by
katharine
prescott
wormeley
dedication
to
my
dear
alexandre
de
berny
his
old
friend
de
balzac
madame
firmiani
many
tales
either
rich
in
situations
or
made
dramatic
by
some
of
the
innumerable
tricks
of
chance
carry
with
them
their
own
particular
setting
which
can
be
rendered
artistically
or
simply
by
those
who
narrate
them
without
their
subjects
losing
any
even
the
least
of
their
charms
but
there
are
some
incidents
in
human
experience
to
which
the
heart
alone
is
able
to
give
life
there
are
certain
details
shall
we
call
them
anatomical
the
delicate
touches
of
which
can
not
be
made
to
reappear
unless
by
an
equally
delicate
rendering
of
thought
there
are
portraits
which
require
the
infusion
of
a
soul
and
mean
nothing
unless
the
subtlest
expression
of
the
speaking
countenance
is
given
furthermore
there
are
things
which
we
know
not
how
to
say
or
do
without
the
aid
of
secret
harmonies
which
a
day
an
hour
a
fortunate
conjunction
of
celestial
signs
or
an
inward
moral
tendency
may
produce
such
mysterious
revelations
are
imperatively
needed
in
order
to
tell
this
simple
history
in
which
we
seek
to
interest
those
souls
that
are
naturally
grave
and
reflective
and
find
their
sustenance
in
tender
emotions
if
the
writer
like
the
surgeon
beside
his
dying
friend
is
filled
with
a
species
of
reverence
for
the
subject
he
is
handling
should
not
the
reader
share
in
that
inexplicable
feeling
is
it
so
difficult
to
put
ourselves
in
unison
with
the
vague
and
nervous
sadness
which
casts
its
gray
tints
all
about
us
and
is
in
fact
a
the
gentle
sufferings
of
which
are
often
pleasing
if
the
reader
is
of
those
who
sometimes
think
upon
the
dear
ones
they
have
lost
if
he
is
alone
if
the
day
is
waning
or
the
night
has
come
let
him
read
on
otherwise
he
should
lay
aside
this
book
at
once
if
he
has
never
buried
a
good
old
relative
infirm
and
poor
he
will
not
understand
these
pages
which
to
some
will
seem
redolent
of
musk
to
others
as
colorless
and
virtuous
as
those
of
florian
in
short
the
reader
must
have
known
the
luxury
of
tears
must
have
felt
the
silent
pangs
of
a
passing
memory
the
vision
of
a
dear
yet
shade
memories
which
bring
regret
for
all
that
earth
has
swallowed
up
with
smiles
for
vanished
joys
and
now
believe
that
the
writer
would
not
for
the
wealth
of
england
steal
from
poesy
a
single
lie
with
which
to
embellish
this
narrative
the
following
is
a
true
history
on
which
you
may
safely
spend
the
treasures
of
your
sensibility
if
you
have
any
in
these
days
the
french
language
has
as
many
idioms
and
represents
as
many
idiosyncracies
as
there
are
varieties
of
men
in
the
great
family
of
france
it
is
extremely
curious
and
amusing
to
listen
to
the
different
interpretations
or
versions
of
the
same
thing
or
the
same
event
by
the
various
species
which
compose
the
genus
parisian
parisian
is
here
used
merely
to
generalize
our
remark
therefore
if
you
should
say
to
an
individual
of
the
species
practical
do
you
know
madame
firmiani
he
would
present
that
lady
to
your
mind
by
the
following
inventory
fine
house
in
the
rue
du
bac
salons
handsomely
furnished
good
pictures
one
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
husband
formerly
of
the
department
of
so
saying
the
practical
man
rotund
and
fat
and
usually
dressed
in
black
will
project
his
lower
lip
and
wrap
it
over
the
upper
nodding
his
head
as
if
to
add
solid
people
those
nothing
to
be
said
against
ask
no
further
practical
men
settle
everybody
s
status
by
figures
incomes
or
solid
acres
a
phrase
of
their
lexicon
turn
to
the
right
and
put
the
same
question
to
that
other
man
who
belongs
to
the
species
lounger
madame
firmiani
he
says
yes
yes
i
know
her
well
i
go
to
her
parties
receives
wednesdays
highly
creditable
madame
firmiani
is
metamorphosed
into
a
house
but
the
house
is
not
a
pile
of
stones
architecturally
superposed
of
course
not
the
word
presents
in
lounger
s
language
an
indescribable
here
the
lounger
a
spare
man
with
an
agreeable
smile
a
sayer
of
pretty
nothings
with
more
acquired
cleverness
than
native
wit
stoops
to
your
ear
and
adds
with
a
shrewd
glance
i
have
never
seen
monsieur
firmiani
his
social
position
is
that
of
looking
after
property
in
italy
madame
firmiani
is
a
frenchwoman
and
spends
her
money
like
a
parisian
she
has
excellent
tea
it
is
one
of
the
few
houses
where
you
can
amuse
yourself
the
refreshments
are
exquisite
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
admitted
therefore
of
course
one
meets
only
the
best
society
in
her
here
the
lounger
takes
a
pinch
of
snuff
he
inhales
it
slowly
and
seems
to
say
i
go
there
but
don
t
expect
me
to
present
evidently
the
lounger
considers
that
madame
firmiani
keeps
a
sort
of
inn
without
a
sign
why
do
you
want
to
know
madame
firmiani
her
parties
are
as
dull
as
the
court
itself
what
is
the
good
of
possessing
a
mind
unless
to
avoid
such
salons
where
stupid
talk
and
foolish
little
ballads
are
the
order
of
the
you
have
questioned
a
being
classed
egotist
a
species
who
would
like
to
keep
the
universe
under
lock
and
key
and
let
nothing
be
done
without
their
permission
they
are
unhappy
if
others
are
happy
they
forgive
nothing
but
vices
downfalls
frailties
and
like
none
but
proteges
aristocrats
by
inclination
they
make
themselves
democrats
out
of
spite
preferring
to
consort
with
inferiors
as
equals
oh
madame
firmiani
my
dear
fellow
she
is
one
of
those
adorable
women
who
serve
as
nature
s
excuse
for
all
the
ugly
ones
she
creates
madame
firmiani
is
enchanting
and
so
kind
i
wish

were

possessed
millions
that
i
might

i
present
you

a
youth
of
the
student

his
boldness

his
timidity

boudoir

woman
between
thirty
and
faded

handsome

contralto
voice
worn

much
dressed
rather
rouged
charming
manners
in
short
my
dear
fellow
the
remains
of
a
pretty
woman
who
is
still
worth
the
trouble
of
a
this
remark
is
from
the
species
fop
who
has
just
breakfasted
doesn
t
weigh
his
words
and
is
about
to
mount
his
horse
at
that
particular
moment

madame
firmiani
is
a
collection
of
painted
canvases
a
woman
madame
firmiani
i
don
t
wish
you
to
visit
this
remark
is
rich
in
meanings
madame
firmiani
dangerous
woman
a
siren
dresses
well
has
taste
gives
other
women
sleepless
nights
your
informant
belongs
to
the
genus
spiteful
an
attache
to
an
embassy
madame
firmiani
isn
t
she
from
antwerp
i
saw
her
ten
years
ago
in
rome
she
was
very
handsome
individuals
of
the
species
attache
have
a
mania
for
talking
in
the
style
of
talleyrand
their
wit
is
often
so
refined
that
the
point
is
imperceptible
they
are
like
who
avoid
hitting
the
ball
with
consummate
dexterity
these
individuals
are
usually
taciturn
and
when
they
talk
it
is
only
about
spain
vienna
italy
or
petersburg
names
of
countries
act
like
springs
in
their
mind
press
them
and
the
ringing
of
their
changes
begins
that
madame
firmiani
sees
a
great
deal
of
the
faubourg
doesn
t
she
this
from
a
person
who
desires
to
belong
to
the
class
distinguished
she
gives
the
de
to
everybody
to
monsieur
dupin
senior
to
monsieur
lafayette
she
flings
it
right
and
left
and
humiliates
many
this
woman
spends
her
life
in
striving
to
know
and
do
the
right
thing
but
for
her
sins
she
lives
in
the
marais
and
her
husband
is
a
lawyer
a
lawyer
before
the
royal
courts
however
madame
firmiani
monsieur
i
do
not
know
this
man
belongs
to
the
species
duke
he
recognizes
none
but
the
women
who
have
been
presented
at
court
pray
excuse
him
he
was
one
of
napoleon
s
creations
madame
firmiani
surely
she
used
to
sing
at
the
species
ninny
the
individuals
of
this
species
have
an
answer
for
everything
they
will
tell
lies
sooner
than
say
nothing
two
old
ladies
wives
of
former
magistrates
the
first
wears
a
cap
with
bows
her
face
is
wrinkled
her
nose
sharp
voice
hard
carries
a
in
her
hand
what
was
that
madame
firmiani
s
maiden
name
the
second
small
face
red
as
a
gentle
voice
she
was
a
cadignan
my
dear
niece
of
the
old
prince
de
cadignan
consequently
cousin
to
the
present
duc
de
madame
firmiani
is
a
cadignan
she
might
have
neither
virtue
nor
wealth
nor
youth
but
she
would
still
be
a
cadignan
it
is
like
a
prejudice
always
alive
and
working
an
original
my
dear
fellow
i
ve
seen
no
galoshes
in
her
antechamber
consequently
you
can
visit
her
without
compromising
yourself
and
play
cards
there
without
fear
if
there
any
scoundrels
in
her
salons
they
are
people
of
quality
and
come
in
their
carriages
such
persons
never
old
man
belonging
to
the
genus
observer
if
you
call
on
madame
firmiani
my
good
friend
you
will
find
a
beautiful
woman
sitting
at
her
ease
by
the
corner
of
her
fireplace
she
will
scarcely
rise
to
receive
you
she
only
does
that
for
women
ambassadors
dukes
and
persons
of
great
distinction
she
is
very
gracious
she
possesses
charm
she
converses
well
and
likes
to
talk
on
many
topics
there
are
many
indications
of
a
passionate
nature
about
her
but
she
has
evidently
so
many
adorers
that
she
can
not
have
a
favorite
if
suspicion
rested
on
two
or
three
of
her
intimates
we
might
say
that
one
or
other
of
them
was
the
cavaliere
servente
but
it
does
not
the
lady
is
a
mystery
she
is
married
though
none
of
us
have
seen
her
husband
monsieur
firmiani
is
altogether
mythical
he
is
like
that
third
for
which
we
pay
though
we
never
behold
it
madame
has
the
finest
contralto
voice
in
europe
so
say
judges
but
she
has
never
been
heard
to
sing
more
than
two
or
three
times
since
she
came
to
paris
she
receives
much
company
but
goes
the
observer
speaks
you
will
notice
as
an
oracle
his
words
anecdotes
and
quotations
must
be
accepted
as
truths
under
pain
of
being
thought
without
social
education
or
intelligence
and
of
causing
him
to
slander
you
with
much
zest
in
twenty
salons
where
he
is
considered
indispensable
the
observer
is
forty
years
of
age
never
dines
at
home
declares
himself
no
longer
dangerous
to
women
wears
a
maroon
coat
and
has
a
place
reserved
for
him
in
several
boxes
at
the
he
is
sometimes
confounded
with
the
parasite
but
he
has
filled
too
many
real
functions
to
be
thought
a
sponger
moreover
he
possesses
a
small
estate
in
a
certain
department
the
name
of
which
he
has
never
been
known
to
utter
madame
firmiani
why
my
dear
fellow
she
was
murat
s
former
this
man
belongs
to
the
contradictors
persons
who
note
errata
in
memoirs
rectify
dates
correct
facts
bet
a
hundred
to
one
and
are
certain
about
everything
you
can
easily
detect
them
in
some
gross
blunder
in
the
course
of
a
single
evening
they
will
tell
you
they
were
in
paris
at
the
time
of
mallet
s
conspiracy
forgetting
that
half
an
hour
earlier
they
had
described
how
they
had
crossed
the
beresina
nearly
all
contradictors
are
chevaliers
of
the
legion
of
honor
they
talk
loudly
have
retreating
foreheads
and
play
high
madame
firmiani
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
nonsense
you
are
crazy
some
people
will
persist
in
giving
millions
with
the
liberality
of
authors
to
whom
it
doesn
t
cost
a
penny
to
dower
their
heroines
madame
firmiani
is
simply
a
coquette
who
has
lately
ruined
a
young
man
and
now
prevents
him
from
making
a
fine
marriage
if
she
were
not
so
handsome
she
wouldn
t
have
a
ah
of
course
you
recognize
him
belongs
to
the
species
envious
there
is
no
need
to
sketch
him
the
species
is
as
well
known
as
that
of
the
felis
domestica
but
how
explain
the
perennial
vigor
of
envy
a
vice
that
brings
nothing
in
persons
in
society
literary
men
honest
folk
in
short
individuals
of
all
species
were
promulgating
in
the
month
of
january
so
many
different
opinions
about
madame
firmiani
that
it
would
be
tedious
to
write
them
down
we
have
merely
sought
to
show
that
a
man
seeking
to
understand
her
yet
unwilling
or
unable
to
go
to
her
house
would
from
the
answers
to
his
inquiries
have
had
equal
reason
to
suppose
her
a
widow
or
wife
silly
or
wise
virtuous
or
the
reverse
rich
or
poor
soulless
or
full
of
feeling
handsome
or
plain
in
short
there
were
as
many
madame
firmianis
as
there
are
species
in
society
or
sects
in
catholicism
frightful
reflection
we
are
all
like
lithographic
blocks
from
which
an
indefinite
number
of
copies
can
be
drawn
by
criticism
the
proofs
being
more
or
less
like
us
according
to
a
distribution
of
shading
which
is
so
nearly
imperceptible
that
our
reputation
depends
barring
the
calumnies
of
friends
and
the
witticisms
of
newspapers
on
the
balance
struck
by
our
criticisers
between
truth
that
limps
and
falsehood
to
which
parisian
wit
gives
wings
madame
firmiani
like
other
noble
and
dignified
women
who
make
their
hearts
a
sanctuary
and
disdain
the
world
was
liable
therefore
to
be
totally
misjudged
by
monsieur
de
bourbonne
an
old
country
magnate
who
had
reason
to
think
a
great
deal
about
her
during
the
winter
of
this
year
he
belonged
to
the
class
of
provincial
planters
men
living
on
their
estates
accustomed
to
keep
close
accounts
of
everything
and
to
bargain
with
the
peasantry
thus
employed
a
man
becomes
sagacious
in
spite
of
himself
just
as
soldiers
in
the
long
run
acquire
courage
from
routine
the
old
gentleman
who
had
come
to
paris
from
touraine
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
about
madame
firmiani
and
found
it
not
at
all
assuaged
by
the
parisian
gossip
which
he
heard
was
a
man
of
honor
and
breeding
his
sole
heir
was
a
nephew
whom
he
greatly
loved
in
whose
interests
he
planted
his
poplars
when
a
man
thinks
without
annoyance
about
his
heir
and
watches
the
trees
grow
daily
finer
for
his
future
benefit
affection
grows
too
with
every
blow
of
the
spade
around
her
roots
though
this
phenomenal
feeling
is
not
common
it
is
still
to
be
met
with
in
touraine
this
cherished
nephew
named
octave
de
camps
was
a
descendant
of
the
famous
abbe
de
camps
so
well
known
to
bibliophiles
and
learned
men
who
by
the
bye
are
not
at
all
the
same
thing
people
in
the
provinces
have
the
bad
habit
of
branding
with
a
sort
of
decent
reprobation
any
young
man
who
sells
his
inherited
estates
this
antiquated
prejudice
has
interfered
very
much
with
the
which
the
present
government
encourages
for
its
own
interests
without
consulting
his
uncle
octave
had
lately
sold
an
estate
belonging
to
him
to
the
black
band
the
chateau
de
villaines
would
have
been
pulled
down
were
it
not
for
the
remonstrances
which
the
old
uncle
made
to
the
representatives
of
the
pickaxe
to
increase
the
old
man
s
wrath
a
distant
relative
one
of
those
cousins
of
small
means
and
much
astuteness
about
whom
shrewd
provincials
are
wont
to
remark
no
lawsuits
for
me
with
him
had
as
it
were
by
accident
come
to
visit
monsieur
de
bourbonne
and
informed
him
of
his
nephew
s
ruin
monsieur
octave
de
camps
he
said
having
wasted
his
means
on
a
certain
madame
firmiani
was
now
reduced
to
teaching
mathematics
for
a
living
while
awaiting
his
uncle
s
death
not
daring
to
let
him
know
of
his
dissipations
this
distant
cousin
a
sort
of
charles
moor
was
not
ashamed
to
give
this
fatal
news
to
the
old
gentleman
as
he
sat
by
his
fire
digesting
a
profuse
provincial
dinner
the
bande
noire
was
a
mysterious
association
of
speculators
whose
object
was
to
buy
in
landed
estates
cut
them
up
and
sell
them
off
in
small
parcels
to
the
peasantry
or
others
but
heirs
can
not
always
rid
themselves
of
uncles
as
easily
as
they
would
like
to
thanks
to
his
obstinacy
this
particular
uncle
refused
to
believe
the
story
and
came
out
victorious
from
the
attack
of
indigestion
produced
by
his
nephew
s
biography
some
shocks
affect
the
heart
others
the
head
but
in
this
case
the
cousin
s
blow
fell
on
the
digestive
organs
and
did
little
harm
for
the
old
man
s
stomach
was
sound
like
a
true
disciple
of
saint
thomas
monsieur
de
bourbonne
came
to
paris
unknown
to
octave
resolved
to
make
full
inquiries
as
to
his
nephew
s
insolvency
having
many
acquaintances
in
the
faubourg
among
the
listomeres
the
lenoncourts
and
the
vandenesses
he
heard
so
much
gossip
so
many
facts
and
falsities
about
madame
firmiani
that
he
resolved
to
be
presented
to
her
under
the
name
of
de
rouxellay
that
of
his
estate
in
touraine
the
astute
old
gentleman
was
careful
to
choose
an
evening
when
he
knew
that
octave
would
be
engaged
in
finishing
a
piece
of
work
which
was
to
pay
him
well
for
this
lover
of
madame
firmiani
still
went
to
her
house
a
circumstance
that
seemed
difficult
to
explain
as
to
octave
s
ruin
that
unfortunately
was
no
fable
as
monsieur
de
bourbonne
had
at
once
discovered
monsieur
de
rouxellay
was
not
at
all
like
the
provincial
uncle
at
the
gymnase
formerly
in
the
king
s
guard
a
man
of
the
world
and
a
favorite
among
women
he
knew
how
to
present
himself
in
society
with
the
courteous
manners
of
the
olden
time
he
could
make
graceful
speeches
and
understand
the
whole
charter
or
most
of
it
though
he
loved
the
bourbons
with
noble
frankness
believed
in
god
as
a
gentleman
should
and
read
nothing
but
the
quotidienne
he
was
not
as
ridiculous
as
the
liberals
of
his
department
would
fain
have
had
him
he
could
hold
his
own
in
the
court
circle
provided
no
one
talked
to
him
of
moses
in
egypt
nor
of
the
drama
or
romanticism
or
local
color
nor
of
railways
he
himself
had
never
got
beyond
monsieur
de
voltaire
monsieur
le
comte
de
buffon
payronnet
and
the
chevalier
gluck
the
queen
s
favorite
musician
madame
he
said
to
the
marquise
de
listomere
who
was
on
his
arm
as
they
entered
madame
firmiani
s
salons
if
this
woman
is
my
nephew
s
mistress
i
pity
him
how
can
she
live
in
the
midst
of
this
luxury
and
know
that
he
is
in
a
garret
hasn
t
she
any
soul
octave
is
a
fool
to
have
given
up
such
an
estate
as
villaines
for
a
monsieur
de
bourbonne
belonged
to
the
species
fossil
and
used
the
language
of
the
days
of
yore
but
suppose
he
had
lost
it
at
play
then
madame
he
would
at
least
have
had
the
pleasure
of
and
do
you
think
he
has
had
no
pleasure
here
see
look
at
madame
the
brightest
memories
of
the
old
man
faded
at
the
sight
of
his
nephew
s
mistress
his
anger
died
away
at
the
gracious
exclamation
which
came
from
his
lips
as
he
looked
at
her
by
one
of
those
fortunate
accidents
which
happen
only
to
pretty
women
it
was
a
moment
when
all
her
beauties
shone
with
peculiar
lustre
due
perhaps
to
the
to
the
charming
simplicity
of
her
dress
to
the
ineffable
atmosphere
of
elegance
that
surrounded
her
one
must
needs
have
studied
the
transitions
of
an
evening
in
a
parisian
salon
to
appreciate
the
imperceptible
lights
and
shades
which
color
a
woman
s
face
and
vary
it
there
comes
a
moment
when
content
with
her
toilet
pleased
with
her
own
wit
delighted
to
be
admired
and
feeling
herself
the
queen
of
a
salon
full
of
remarkable
men
who
smile
to
her
the
parisian
woman
reaches
a
full
consciousness
of
her
grace
and
charm
her
beauty
is
enhanced
by
the
looks
she
gathers
in
a
mute
homage
which
she
transfers
with
subtle
glances
to
the
man
she
loves
at
moments
like
these
a
woman
is
invested
with
supernatural
power
and
becomes
a
magician
a
charmer
without
herself
knowing
that
she
is
one
involuntarily
she
inspires
the
love
that
fills
her
own
bosom
her
smiles
and
glances
fascinate
if
this
condition
which
comes
from
the
soul
can
give
attraction
even
to
a
plain
woman
with
what
radiance
does
it
not
invest
a
woman
of
natural
elegance
distinguished
bearing
fair
fresh
with
sparkling
eyes
and
dressed
in
a
taste
that
wrings
approval
from
artists
and
her
bitterest
rivals
have
you
ever
for
your
happiness
met
a
woman
whose
harmonious
voice
gives
to
her
speech
the
same
charm
that
emanates
from
her
manners
a
woman
who
knows
how
to
speak
and
to
be
silent
whose
words
are
happily
chosen
whose
language
is
pure
and
who
concerns
herself
in
your
interests
with
delicacy
her
raillery
is
caressing
her
criticism
never
wounds
she
neither
discourses
nor
argues
but
she
likes
to
lead
a
discussion
and
stop
it
at
the
right
moment
her
manner
is
affable
and
smiling
her
politeness
never
forced
her
readiness
to
serve
others
never
servile
she
reduces
the
respect
she
claims
to
a
soft
shadow
she
never
wearies
you
and
you
leave
her
satisfied
with
her
and
with
yourself
her
charming
grace
is
conveyed
to
all
the
things
with
which
she
surrounds
herself
everything
about
her
pleases
the
eye
in
her
presence
you
breathe
as
it
were
your
native
air
this
woman
is
natural
there
is
no
effort
about
her
she
is
aiming
at
no
effect
her
feelings
are
shown
simply
because
they
are
true
frank
herself
she
does
not
wound
the
vanity
of
others
she
accepts
men
as
god
made
them
pitying
the
vicious
forgiving
defects
and
absurdities
comprehending
all
ages
and
vexed
by
nothing
because
she
has
had
the
sense
and
tact
to
foresee
all
tender
and
gay
she
gratifies
before
she
consoles
you
love
her
so
well
that
if
this
angel
did
wrong
you
would
be
ready
to
excuse
her
if
for
your
happiness
you
have
met
with
such
a
woman
you
know
madame
firmiani
after
monsieur
de
bourbonne
had
talked
with
her
for
ten
minutes
sitting
beside
her
his
nephew
was
forgiven
he
perceived
that
whatever
the
actual
truth
might
be
the
relation
between
madame
firmiani
and
octave
covered
some
mystery
returning
to
the
illusions
that
gild
the
days
of
youth
and
judging
madame
firmiani
by
her
beauty
the
old
gentleman
became
convinced
that
a
woman
so
innately
conscious
of
her
dignity
as
she
appeared
to
be
was
incapable
of
a
bad
action
her
dark
eyes
told
of
inward
peace
the
lines
of
her
face
were
so
noble
the
profile
so
pure
and
the
passion
he
had
come
to
investigate
seemed
so
little
to
oppress
her
heart
that
the
old
man
said
to
himself
while
noting
all
the
promises
of
love
and
virtue
given
by
that
adorable
countenance
my
nephew
is
committing
some
madame
firmiani
acknowledged
to
but
the
practicals
proved
that
having
married
the
invisible
firmiani
then
a
highly
respectable
individual
in
the
forties
in
at
the
age
of
sixteen
she
must
be
at
least
in
however
the
same
persons
also
asserted
that
at
no
period
of
her
life
had
she
ever
been
so
desirable
or
so
completely
a
woman
she
was
now
at
an
age
when
women
are
most
prone
to
conceive
a
passion
and
to
desire
it
perhaps
in
their
pensive
hours
she
possessed
all
that
earth
sells
all
that
it
lends
all
that
it
gives
the
attaches
declared
there
was
nothing
of
which
she
was
ignorant
the
contradictors
asserted
that
there
was
much
she
ought
to
learn
the
observers
remarked
that
her
hands
were
white
her
feet
small
her
movements
a
trifle
too
undulating
but
nevertheless
individuals
of
all
species
envied
or
disputed
octave
s
happiness
agreeing
for
once
in
a
way
that
madame
firmiani
was
the
most
aristocratically
beautiful
woman
in
paris
still
young
rich
a
perfect
musician
intelligent
witty
refined
and
received
as
a
cadignan
by
the
princesse
de
that
oracle
of
the
noble
faubourg
loved
by
her
rivals
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
her
cousin
the
marquise
d
espard
and
madame
de
macumer
madame
firmiani
gratified
all
the
vanities
which
feed
or
excite
love
she
was
therefore
sought
by
too
many
men
not
to
fall
a
victim
to
parisian
malice
and
its
charming
calumnies
whispered
behind
a
fan
or
in
a
safe
aside
it
was
necessary
to
quote
the
remarks
given
at
the
beginning
of
this
history
to
bring
out
the
true
firmiani
in
contradistinction
to
the
firmiani
of
society
if
some
women
forgave
her
happiness
others
did
not
forgive
her
propriety
now
nothing
is
so
dangerous
in
paris
as
unfounded
suspicions
for
the
reason
that
it
is
impossible
to
destroy
them
this
sketch
of
a
woman
who
was
admirably
natural
gives
only
a
faint
idea
of
her
it
would
need
the
pencil
of
an
ingres
to
render
the
pride
of
that
brow
with
its
wealth
of
hair
the
dignity
of
that
glance
and
the
thoughts
betrayed
by
the
changing
colors
of
her
cheeks
in
her
were
all
things
poets
could
have
found
an
agnes
sorel
and
a
joan
of
arc
also
the
woman
unknown
the
soul
within
that
form
the
soul
of
eve
the
knowledge
of
the
treasures
of
good
and
the
riches
of
evil
error
and
resignation
crime
and
devotion
the
donna
julia
and
the
haidee
of
lord
byron
the
former
guardsman
stayed
with
apparent
impertinence
after
the
other
guests
had
left
the
salons
and
madame
firmiani
found
him
sitting
quietly
before
her
in
an
armchair
evidently
determined
to
remain
with
the
pertinacity
of
a
fly
which
we
are
forced
to
kill
to
get
rid
of
it
the
hands
of
the
clock
marked
two
in
the
morning
madame
said
the
old
gentlemen
as
madame
firmiani
rose
hoping
to
make
him
understand
that
it
was
her
good
pleasure
he
should
go
madame
i
am
the
uncle
of
monsieur
octave
de
madame
firmiani
immediately
sat
down
again
and
showed
her
emotion
in
spite
of
his
sagacity
the
old
planter
was
unable
to
decide
whether
she
turned
pale
from
shame
or
pleasure
there
are
pleasures
delicious
emotions
the
chaste
heart
seeks
to
veil
which
can
not
escape
the
shock
of
startled
modesty
the
more
delicacy
a
woman
has
the
more
she
seeks
to
hide
the
joys
that
are
in
her
soul
many
women
incomprehensible
in
their
tender
caprices
long
to
hear
a
name
pronounced
which
at
other
times
they
desire
to
bury
in
their
hearts
monsieur
de
bourbonne
did
not
interpret
madame
firmiani
s
agitation
exactly
in
this
way
pray
forgive
him
all
provincials
are
distrustful
well
monsieur
said
madame
firmiani
giving
him
one
of
those
clear
lucid
glances
in
which
we
men
can
never
see
anything
because
they
question
us
too
much
well
madame
returned
the
old
man
do
you
know
what
some
one
came
to
tell
me
in
the
depths
of
my
province
that
my
nephew
had
ruined
himself
for
you
and
that
the
poor
fellow
was
living
in
a
garret
while
you
were
in
silk
and
gold
forgive
my
rustic
sincerity
it
may
be
useful
for
you
to
know
of
these
stop
monsieur
said
madame
firmiani
with
an
imperative
gesture
i
know
all
that
you
are
too
polite
to
continue
this
subject
if
i
request
you
to
leave
it
and
too
gallant
in
the
sense
of
the
word
she
added
with
a
slight
tone
of
irony
not
to
agree
that
you
have
no
right
to
question
me
it
would
be
ridiculous
in
me
to
defend
myself
i
trust
that
you
will
have
a
sufficiently
good
opinion
of
my
character
to
believe
in
the
profound
contempt
which
i
assure
you
i
feel
for
money
although
i
was
married
without
any
fortune
to
a
man
of
immense
wealth
it
is
nothing
to
me
whether
your
nephew
is
rich
or
poor
if
i
have
received
him
in
my
house
and
do
now
receive
him
it
is
because
i
consider
him
worthy
to
be
counted
among
my
friends
all
my
friends
monsieur
respect
each
other
they
know
that
i
have
not
philosophy
enough
to
admit
into
my
house
those
i
do
not
esteem
this
may
argue
a
want
of
charity
but
my
has
maintained
in
me
to
this
day
a
profound
aversion
for
tattle
and
also
for
through
the
ring
of
her
voice
was
slightly
raised
during
the
first
part
of
this
answer
the
last
words
were
said
with
the
ease
and
of
celimene
bantering
the
misanthrope
madame
said
monsieur
de
bourbonne
in
a
voice
of
some
emotion
i
am
an
old
man
i
am
almost
octave
s
father
and
i
ask
your
pardon
most
humbly
for
the
question
that
i
shall
now
venture
to
put
to
you
giving
you
my
word
of
honor
as
a
loyal
gentleman
that
your
answer
shall
die
here
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
with
an
gesture
that
was
truly
religious
are
these
rumors
true
do
you
love
octave
monsieur
she
replied
to
any
other
man
i
should
answer
that
question
only
by
a
look
but
to
you
and
because
you
are
indeed
almost
the
father
of
monsieur
de
camps
i
reply
by
asking
what
you
would
think
of
a
woman
if
to
such
a
question
she
answered
to
avow
our
love
for
him
we
love
when
he
loves
us
ah
that
may
be
but
even
when
we
are
certain
of
being
loved
forever
believe
me
monsieur
it
is
an
effort
for
us
and
a
reward
to
him
to
say
to
another
she
did
not
end
her
sentence
but
rose
bowed
to
the
old
man
and
withdrew
into
her
private
apartments
the
doors
of
which
opening
and
closing
behind
her
had
a
language
of
their
own
to
his
sagacious
ears
ah
the
mischief
thought
he
what
a
woman
she
is
either
a
sly
one
or
an
angel
and
he
got
into
his
hired
coach
the
horses
of
which
were
stamping
on
the
pavement
of
the
silent
courtyard
while
the
coachman
was
asleep
on
his
box
after
cursing
for
the
hundredth
time
his
tardy
customer
the
next
morning
about
eight
o
clock
the
old
gentleman
mounted
the
stairs
of
a
house
in
the
rue
de
l
observance
where
octave
de
camps
was
living
if
there
was
ever
an
astonished
man
it
was
the
young
professor
when
he
beheld
his
uncle
the
door
was
unlocked
his
lamp
still
burning
he
had
been
sitting
up
all
night
you
rascal
said
monsieur
de
bourbonne
sitting
down
in
the
nearest
chair
since
when
is
it
the
fashion
to
laugh
at
uncles
who
have
thousand
francs
a
year
from
solid
acres
to
which
we
are
the
sole
heir
let
me
tell
you
that
in
the
olden
time
we
stood
in
awe
of
such
uncles
as
that
come
speak
up
what
fault
have
you
to
find
with
me
haven
t
i
played
my
part
as
uncle
properly
did
i
ever
require
you
to
respect
me
have
i
ever
refused
you
money
when
did
i
shut
the
door
in
your
face
on
pretence
that
you
had
come
to
look
after
my
health
haven
t
you
had
the
most
accommodating
and
the
least
domineering
uncle
that
there
is
in
france
i
won
t
say
europe
because
that
might
be
too
presumptuous
you
write
to
me
or
you
don
t
write
no
matter
i
live
on
pledged
affection
and
i
am
making
you
the
prettiest
estate
in
all
touraine
the
envy
of
the
department
to
be
sure
i
don
t
intend
to
let
you
have
it
till
the
last
possible
moment
but
that
s
an
excusable
little
fancy
isn
t
it
and
what
does
monsieur
himself
do
sells
his
own
property
and
lives
like
a
lackey
uncle
i
m
not
talking
about
uncles
i
m
talking
nephew
i
have
a
right
to
your
confidence
come
confess
at
once
it
is
much
the
easiest
way
i
know
that
by
experience
have
you
been
gambling
have
you
lost
money
at
the
bourse
say
uncle
i
m
a
wretch
and
i
ll
hug
you
but
if
you
tell
me
any
lies
greater
than
those
i
used
to
tell
at
your
age
i
ll
sell
my
property
buy
an
annuity
and
go
back
to
the
evil
ways
of
my
youth
if
i
uncle
i
saw
your
madame
firmiani
yesterday
went
on
the
old
fellow
kissing
the
tips
of
his
fingers
which
he
gathered
into
a
bunch
she
is
charming
you
have
the
consent
and
approbation
of
your
uncle
if
that
will
do
you
any
good
as
to
the
sanction
of
the
church
i
suppose
that
s
useless
and
the
sacraments
cost
so
much
in
these
days
come
speak
out
have
you
ruined
yourself
for
her
yes
ha
the
jade
i
d
have
wagered
it
in
my
time
the
women
of
the
court
were
cleverer
at
ruining
a
man
than
the
courtesans
of
but
this
one
i
recognized
her
it
is
a
bit
of
the
last
uncle
said
octave
with
a
manner
that
was
tender
and
grave
you
are
totally
mistaken
madame
firmiani
deserves
your
esteem
and
all
the
adoration
the
world
gives
youth
youth
always
the
same
cried
monsieur
de
bourbonne
well
go
on
tell
me
the
same
old
story
but
please
remember
that
my
experience
in
gallantry
is
not
of
my
dear
kind
uncle
here
is
a
letter
which
will
tell
you
nearly
all
said
octave
taking
it
from
an
elegant
portfolio
gift
no
doubt
when
you
have
read
it
i
will
tell
you
the
rest
and
you
will
then
know
a
madame
firmiani
who
is
unknown
to
the
i
haven
t
my
spectacles
read
it
octave
began
my
beloved
hey
then
you
are
still
intimate
with
her
interrupted
his
uncle
why
yes
of
you
haven
t
parted
from
her
parted
repeated
octave
we
are
heavens
cried
monsieur
de
bourbonne
then
why
do
you
live
in
a
garret
let
me
go
true
i
m
octave
resumed
the
letter
but
there
were
passages
which
he
could
not
read
without
deep
emotion
my
beloved
husband
you
ask
me
the
reason
of
my
sadness
has
it
then
passed
from
my
soul
to
my
face
or
have
you
only
guessed
it
but
how
could
you
fail
to
do
so
one
in
heart
as
we
are
i
can
not
deceive
you
this
may
be
a
misfortune
for
it
is
one
of
the
conditions
of
happy
love
that
a
wife
shall
be
gay
and
caressing
perhaps
i
ought
to
deceive
you
but
i
would
not
do
it
even
if
the
happiness
with
which
you
have
blessed
and
overpowered
me
depended
on
it
ah
dearest
how
much
gratitude
there
is
in
my
love
i
long
to
love
you
forever
without
limit
yes
i
desire
to
be
forever
proud
of
you
a
woman
s
glory
is
in
the
man
she
loves
esteem
consideration
honor
must
they
not
be
his
who
receives
our
all
well
my
angel
has
fallen
yes
dear
the
tale
you
told
me
has
tarnished
my
past
joys
since
then
i
have
felt
myself
humiliated
in
you
you
whom
i
thought
the
most
honorable
of
men
as
you
are
the
most
loving
the
most
tender
i
must
indeed
have
deep
confidence
in
your
heart
so
young
and
pure
to
make
you
this
avowal
which
costs
me
much
ah
my
dear
love
how
is
it
that
you
knowing
your
father
had
unjustly
deprived
others
of
their
property
that
you
can
keep
it
and
you
told
me
of
this
criminal
act
in
a
room
filled
with
the
mute
witnesses
of
our
love
and
you
are
a
gentleman
and
you
think
yourself
noble
and
i
am
yours
i
try
to
find
excuses
for
you
i
do
find
them
in
your
youth
and
thoughtlessness
i
know
there
is
still
something
of
the
child
about
you
perhaps
you
have
never
thought
seriously
of
what
fortune
and
integrity
are
oh
how
your
laugh
wounded
me
reflect
on
that
ruined
family
always
in
distress
poor
young
girls
who
have
reason
to
curse
you
daily
an
old
father
saying
to
himself
each
night
we
might
not
now
be
starving
if
that
man
s
father
had
been
an
honest
man
good
heavens
cried
monsieur
de
bourbonne
interrupting
his
nephew
surely
you
have
not
been
such
a
fool
as
to
tell
that
woman
about
your
father
s
affair
with
the
bourgneufs
women
know
more
about
wasting
a
fortune
than
making
they
know
about
integrity
but
let
me
read
on
octave
no
power
on
earth
has
authority
to
change
the
principles
of
honor
look
into
your
conscience
and
ask
it
by
what
name
you
are
to
call
the
action
by
which
you
hold
your
the
nephew
looked
at
the
uncle
who
lowered
his
head
i
will
not
tell
you
all
the
thoughts
that
assail
me
they
can
be
reduced
to
one
this
is
it
i
can
not
respect
the
man
who
knowingly
is
smirched
for
a
sum
of
money
whatever
the
amount
may
be
five
francs
stolen
at
play
or
five
times
a
hundred
thousand
gained
by
a
legal
trick
are
equally
dishonoring
i
will
tell
you
all
i
feel
myself
degraded
by
the
very
love
which
has
hitherto
been
all
my
joy
there
rises
in
my
soul
a
voice
which
my
tenderness
can
not
stifle
ah
i
have
wept
to
feel
that
i
have
more
conscience
than
love
were
you
to
commit
a
crime
i
would
hide
you
in
my
bosom
from
human
justice
but
my
devotion
could
go
no
farther
love
to
a
woman
means
boundless
confidence
united
to
a
need
of
reverencing
of
esteeming
the
being
to
whom
she
belongs
i
have
never
conceived
of
love
otherwise
than
as
a
fire
in
which
all
noble
feelings
are
purified
still
more
a
fire
which
develops
them
i
have
but
one
thing
else
to
say
come
to
me
poor
and
my
love
shall
be
redoubled
if
not
renounce
it
should
i
see
you
no
more
i
shall
know
what
it
means
but
i
do
not
wish
understand
me
that
you
should
make
restitution
because
i
urge
it
consult
your
own
conscience
an
act
of
justice
such
as
that
ought
not
to
be
a
sacrifice
made
to
love
i
am
your
wife
and
not
your
mistress
and
it
is
less
a
question
of
pleasing
me
than
of
inspiring
in
my
soul
a
true
respect
if
i
am
mistaken
if
you
have
your
father
s
action
if
in
short
you
still
think
your
right
to
the
property
equitable
oh
how
i
long
to
persuade
myself
that
you
are
blameless
consider
and
decide
by
listening
to
the
voice
of
your
conscience
act
wholly
and
solely
from
yourself
a
man
who
loves
a
woman
sincerely
as
you
love
me
respects
the
sanctity
of
her
trust
in
him
too
deeply
to
dishonor
himself
i
blame
myself
now
for
what
i
have
written
a
word
might
have
sufficed
and
i
have
preached
to
you
scold
me
i
wish
to
be
scolded
but
not
much
only
a
little
dear
between
us
two
the
power
is
yours
you
alone
should
perceive
your
own
well
uncle
said
octave
whose
eyes
were
full
of
tears
there
s
more
in
the
letter
finish
oh
the
rest
is
only
to
be
read
by
a
lover
answered
octave
smiling
yes
right
my
boy
said
the
old
man
gently
i
have
had
many
affairs
in
my
day
but
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
i
too
have
loved
et
ego
in
but
i
don
t
understand
yet
why
you
give
lessons
in
my
dear
uncle
i
am
your
nephew
isn
t
that
as
good
as
saying
that
i
had
dipped
into
the
capital
left
me
by
my
father
after
i
had
read
this
letter
a
sort
of
revolution
took
place
within
me
i
paid
my
whole
arrearage
of
remorse
in
one
day
i
can
not
describe
to
you
the
state
i
was
in
as
i
drove
in
the
bois
a
voice
called
to
me
that
horse
is
not
yours
when
i
ate
my
dinner
it
was
saying
you
have
stolen
this
i
was
ashamed
the
fresher
my
honesty
the
more
intense
it
was
i
rushed
to
madame
firmiani
uncle
that
day
i
had
pleasures
of
the
heart
enjoyments
of
the
soul
that
were
far
beyond
millions
together
we
made
out
the
account
of
what
was
due
to
the
bourgneufs
and
i
condemned
myself
against
madame
firmiani
s
advice
to
pay
three
per
cent
interest
but
all
i
had
did
not
suffice
to
cover
the
full
amount
we
were
lovers
enough
for
her
to
offer
and
me
to
accept
her
savings
what
besides
her
other
virtues
does
that
adorable
woman
lay
by
money
cried
his
uncle
don
t
laugh
at
her
uncle
her
position
has
obliged
her
to
be
very
careful
her
husband
went
to
greece
in
and
died
there
three
years
later
it
has
been
impossible
up
to
the
present
time
to
get
legal
proofs
of
his
death
or
obtain
the
will
which
he
made
leaving
his
whole
property
to
his
wife
these
papers
were
either
lost
or
stolen
or
have
gone
astray
during
the
troubles
in
greece
a
country
where
registers
are
not
kept
as
they
are
in
france
and
where
we
have
no
consul
uncertain
whether
she
might
not
be
forced
to
give
up
her
fortune
she
has
lived
with
the
utmost
prudence
as
for
me
i
wish
to
acquire
property
which
shall
be
so
as
to
provide
for
my
wife
in
case
she
is
forced
to
lose
but
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
all
this
my
dear
nephew
you
might
have
known
that
i
love
you
enough
to
pay
all
your
good
debts
the
debts
of
a
gentleman
i
ll
play
the
traditional
uncle
now
and
revenge
myself
ah
uncle
i
know
your
vengeance
but
let
me
get
rich
by
my
own
industry
if
you
want
to
do
me
a
real
service
make
me
an
allowance
of
two
or
three
thousand
francs
a
year
till
i
see
my
way
to
an
enterprise
for
which
i
shall
want
capital
at
this
moment
i
am
so
happy
that
all
i
desire
is
just
the
means
of
living
i
give
lessons
so
that
i
may
not
live
at
the
cost
of
if
you
only
knew
the
happiness
i
had
in
making
that
restitution
i
found
the
bourgneufs
after
a
good
deal
of
trouble
living
miserably
and
in
need
of
everything
the
old
father
was
a
lottery
agent
the
two
daughters
kept
his
books
and
took
care
of
the
house
the
mother
was
always
ill
the
daughters
are
charming
girls
but
they
have
been
cruelly
taught
that
the
world
thinks
little
of
beauty
without
money
what
a
scene
it
was
i
entered
their
house
the
accomplice
in
a
crime
i
left
it
an
honest
man
who
had
purged
his
father
s
memory
uncle
i
don
t
judge
him
there
is
such
excitement
such
passion
in
a
lawsuit
that
even
an
honorable
man
may
be
led
astray
by
them
lawyers
can
make
the
most
unjust
claims
legal
laws
have
convenient
syllogisms
to
quiet
consciences
my
visit
was
a
drama
to
providence
itself
actually
to
fulfil
that
futile
wish
if
heaven
were
to
send
us
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
that
silly
wish
we
all
make
laughing
to
bring
opulence
to
a
family
sitting
by
the
light
of
one
miserable
lamp
over
a
poor
turf
fire
no
words
can
not
describe
it
my
extreme
justice
seemed
to
them
unjust
well
if
there
is
a
paradise
my
father
is
happy
in
it
now
as
for
me
i
am
loved
as
no
man
was
ever
loved
yet
madame
firmiani
gives
me
more
than
happiness
she
has
inspired
me
with
a
delicacy
of
feeling
i
think
i
lacked
so
i
call
her
dear
a
which
expresses
certain
secret
harmonies
within
our
hearts
i
find
honesty
profitable
i
shall
get
rich
in
time
by
myself
i
ve
an
industrial
scheme
in
my
head
and
if
it
succeeds
i
shall
earn
ah
my
boy
you
have
your
mother

soul
said
the
old
man
his
eyes
filling
at
the
thought
of
his
sister
just
then
in
spite
of
the
distance
between
octave
s
garret
and
the
street
the
young
man
heard
the
sound
of
a
carriage
there
she
is
he
cried
i
know
her
horses
by
the
way
they
are
pulled
a
few
moments
more
and
madame
firmiani
entered
the
room
ah
she
exclaimed
with
a
gesture
of
annoyance
at
seeing
monsieur
de
bourbonne
but
our
uncle
is
not
in
the
way
she
added
quickly
smiling
i
came
to
humbly
entreat
my
husband
to
accept
my
fortune
the
austrian
embassy
has
just
sent
me
a
document
which
proves
the
death
of
monsieur
firmiani
also
the
will
which
his
valet
was
keeping
safely
to
put
into

all
you
are
richer

for
you

here
laying
her

upon
his

to
which
none
but
god
can
then
unable
to
