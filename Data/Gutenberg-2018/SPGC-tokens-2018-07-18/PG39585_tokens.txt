upon

introduction
by
wells
your
egoist
like
the
solitary
beasts
lives
only
for
himself
your
altruist
declares
that
he
lives
only
for
others
for
either
there
may
be
success
or
failure
but
for
neither
can
there
be
tragedy
for
even
if
the
altruist
meets
nothing
but
ingratitude
what
has
he
to
complain
of
his
premises
abolish
his
grounds
of
complaint
but
both
egoist
and
altruist
are
philosophical
abstractions
the
human
being
by
nature
and
necessity
is
neither
egoist
nor
altruist
he
trims
a
difficult
course
between
the
two
for
the
most
part
we
are
within
the
limits
of
our
powers
of
expression
and
our
desire
is
to
think
and
if
possible
talk
and
write
about
this
marvellous
experiment
of
ourselves
with
all
the
world
or
as
much
as
we
can
conveniently
assemble
for
audience
there
is
variety
in
our
styles
some
drape
the
central
figure
some
let
it
rather
appear
than
call
attention
to
it
some
affect
a
needless
frankness
am
an
egotist
mind
you
and
i
pretend
nothing
else
some
by
adopting
a
pose
with
accessories
do
at
least
develop
so
great
and
passionate
an
interest
in
the
accessories
as
to
generalise
and
escape
more
or
less
completely
from
self
an
egotism
like
an
eggshell
is
a
thing
from
which
to
escape
the
art
of
life
is
that
escape
the
fundamental
art
of
life
is
to
recover
the
sense
of
that
great
continuous
life
from
which
we
have
individually
budded
off
many
people
have
done
this
through
religion
which
begins
with
a
tremendous
clamour
to
some
saviour
god
or
other
to
recognise
us
and
ends
in
our
recognition
of
him
or
through
science
when
your
egotist
begins
with
behold
me
i
i
your
humble
servant
am
a
scientific
man
devoted
to
the
clear
statement
of
truth
and
ends
with
so
passionate
a
statement
of
truth
that
self
is
forgotten
altogether
in
this
diary
of
an
intensely
egotistical
young
naturalist
tragically
caught
by
the
creeping
approach
of
death
we
have
one
of
the
most
moving
records
of
the
youthful
aspects
of
our
universal
struggle
we
begin
with
one
of
those
bright
schoolboys
that
most
of
us
like
to
fancy
we
once
were
that
many
of
us
have
come
to
love
as
sons
or
nephews
or
younger
brothers
and
this
youngster
is
attracted
by
natural
science
by
the
employments
of
the
naturalist
and
by
the
thought
of
being
himself
some
day
a
naturalist
from
the
very
beginning
we
find
in
this
diary
the
three
qualities
from
the
narrowest
to
broadest
observe
me
he
says
to
himself
i
am
observing
nature
there
is
the
boy
but
he
also
says
i
am
observing
nature
and
at
moments
comes
the
clear
light
he
forgets
himself
in
the
twilight
cave
with
the
bats
or
watching
the
starlings
in
the
evening
sky
he
becomes
just
you
and
i
and
the
mind
of
mankind
gathering
knowledge
and
the
diary
as
the
keen
edge
of
untimely
fate
cuts
down
into
the
sensitive
tissue
shows
us
presently
after
outcries
and
sorrow
and
darkness
of
spirit
the
habits
of
the
observer
rising
to
the
occasion
not
for
him
he
realises
are
the
long
life
the
honours
of
science
the
croonian
lecture
the
listening
royal
society
one
memory
embalmed
in
specific
or
generic
names
the
sure
place
in
the
temple
of
fame
that
once
filled
his
boyish
dreams
but
here
is
something
close
at
hand
to
go
on
observing
manfully
to
the
end
in
which
self
may
be
forgotten
and
that
is
his
own
tormented
self
with
desire
still
great
and
power
and
hope
receding
i
will
go
on
with
this
diary
i
read
between
the
lines
you
shall
have
at
least
one
specimen
carefully
displayed
and
labelled
here
is
a
recorded
unhappiness
when
you
talk
about
life
and
the
rewards
of
life
and
the
justice
of
life
and
its
penalties
what
you
say
must
square
with
this
such
is
what
we
have
here
it
will
be
going
beyond
the
necessities
of
this
preface
to
expatiate
upon
a
certain
thread
of
unpremeditated
and
exquisite
beauty
that
runs
through
the
story
this
diary
tells
to
all
sensitive
readers
it
will
be
plain
enough
and
those
who
can
not
see
it
plain
do
not
deserve
to
have
it
underlined
for
them
that
still
unseeing
they
may
pretend
to
see
nor
need
we
dilate
upon
the
development
of
the
quality
of
this
diary
from
the
rather
fussy
egotism
of
the
earlier
half
but
it
may
be
well
to
add
a
few
explanatory
facts
that
the
opening
chapters
rather
take
for
granted
barbellion
began
life
at
a
material
as
well
as
a
physical
disadvantage
neither
of
his
parents
were
sturdy
people
his
mother
died
at
last
of
constitutional
heart
weakness
and
his
father
belonged
to
that
most
unfortunate
class
the
poor
educated
who
live
lives
of
worry
in
straitened
circumstances
barbellion
father
was
a
newspaper
reporter
in
a
west
country
town
his
income
rarely
exceeded
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
a
year
the
educational
facilities
of
the
place
were
poor
and
young
barbellion
had
to
get
such
learning
as
he
could
as
a
day
boy
at
a
small
private
school
his
father
supplementing
this
meagre
training
and
presently
taking
him
on
as
an
apprentice
reporter
how
the
passion
for
natural
science
arose
does
not
appear
in
this
diary
we
already
find
the
naturalist
formed
in
the
first
schoolboy
entries
an
uncle
a
chemist
seems
to
have
encouraged
the
tendency
and
to
have
given
him
textbooks
and
other
help
somehow
at
any
rate
he
acquired
a
considerable
amount
of
knowledge
by
the
time
he
was
eighteen
he
was
already
publishing
quite
excellent
observations
of
his
own
in
such
periodicals
as
the
and
by
the
time
he
was
twenty
he
could
secure
an
appointment
as
assistant
naturalist
to
the
director
of
a
marine
biological
station
it
was
a
success
as
the
reader
will
learn
gained
only
to
be
renounced
his
father
was
ill
and
he
had
to
stand
by
his
family
our
economical
country
can
not
afford
to
make
biologists
out
of
men
who
can
earn
a
living
as
hack
reporters
poverty
and
science
are
sisters
wherever
the
flag
of
britain
waves
for
how
could
the
rich
live
if
we
wasted
money
on
that
sort
of
thing
but
the
dream
was
not
altogether
abandoned
and
in
barbellion
got
a
post
one
of
the
dozen
or
so
of
rare
and
coveted
opportunities
to
toil
in
a
scientific
atmosphere
that
our
empire
affords
he
secured
an
assistantship
at
the
natural
history
museum
south
kensington
to
which
a
living
wage
was
attached
a
fair
equivalent
to
a
reporter
earnings
the
rest
of
the
story
needs
no
helping
out
let
me
only
add
that
since
barbellion
in
spite
of
his
steadily
diminishing
strength
has
published
articles
in
both
british
and
american
periodicals
that
entirely
justify
the
statement
that
in
him
biological
science
loses
one
of
the
most
promising
of
its
recent
recruits
his
scientific
work
is
not
only
full
and
exact
but
it
has
those
literary
qualities
the
grace
the
power
of
handling
the
breadth
of
reference
which
have
always
distinguished
the
best
english
biological
work
and
which
mark
off
at
once
the
true
scientific
man
from
the
mere
collector
and
recorder
of
items
with
this
much
introduction
barbellion
may
be
left
to
tell
the
tragedy
of
his
hopes
and
of
the
dark
unforeseen
unforeseeable
and
inexplicable
fate
that
has
overtaken
him
part
i
the
journal
begins
when
its
author
is
a
little
over
years
old
the
following
are
selected
entries
am
writing
an
essay
on
the
of
insects
and
have
abandoned
the
idea
of
writing
on
how
cats
spend
their
time
went
with
l
out
catapult
shooting
while
walking
down
the
main
road
saw
a
goldfinch
but
very
indistinctly
it
might
not
have
been
one
had
some
wonderful
shots
at
a
tree
creeper
in
the
hedge
about
a
foot
away
from
me
while
near
a
stream
l
spotted
what
he
thought
to
be
some
wild
duck
and
brought
one
down
hitting
it
right
in
the
head
he
is
a
splendid
shot
we
discovered
on
examining
it
that
it
was
wild
duck
at
all
but
an
ordinary
tame
wild
duck
a
hen
we
ran
away
and
l
tells
me
he
saw
the
farmer
enter
the
poulterer
shop
with
the
bird
in
his
hand
went
to
a
wood
with
s
and
l
saw
a
barn
owl
flying
in
broad
daylight
at
a
woods
be
it
known
there
is
a
steep
cliff
where
we
were
all
out
climbing
to
inspect
and
find
all
the
likely
places
for
birds
to
build
in
next
spring
i
got
along
all
right
but
l
being
a
bit
too
careless
let
go
his
hold
on
a
tree
and
fell
headlong
down
he
turned
over
and
over
and
seemed
to
us
to
pitch
on
the
back
of
his
neck
however
he
got
up
as
cheerfully
as
ever
saying
i
do
like
that
a
bit
of
a
nasty
knock
joe
became
the
mother
of
one
kitten
it
was
born
at
it
is
a
tiny
little
thing
one
would
almost
call
it
deformed
it
is
gray
our
goldfinch
roosts
at
joe
kitten
is
a
very
small
one
magpie
is
its
name
went
our
usual
ramble
but
we
were
unfortunate
from
the
very
beginning
first
when
we
reached
the
nightjar
field
we
found
there
were
two
men
at
the
bottom
of
it
cutting
the
hedge
so
we
decided
not
to
venture
on
as
gimbo
and
bounce
were
with
us
and
it
would
look
like
poaching
later
on
we
came
to
a
splendid
wood
but
had
to
withdraw
hastily
from
it
an
old
farmer
giving
us
a
severe
chase
there
were
innumerable
rabbits
in
the
wood
so
of
course
the
dogs
barked
hard
i
gave
them
a
sound
beating
when
we
got
back
out
of
danger
the
old
farmer
is
known
as
bale
the
i
was
glad
yesterday
to
see
the
egg
season
so
well
in
i
shall
have
to
get
and
egg
drills
spring
has
really
arrived
and
even
the
grasshoppers
are
beginning
to
stridulate
yet
burke
describes
these
little
creatures
as
being
loud
and
troublesome
and
the
chirp
unpleasant
like
samuel
johnson
he
must
have
preferred
brick
walls
to
green
hedges
many
people
go
for
a
walk
and
yet
are
unable
to
admire
nature
simply
because
their
power
of
observation
is
untrained
of
course
some
are
not
suited
to
the
study
at
all
and
do
not
trouble
themselves
about
it
in
that
case
they
should
not
talk
of
what
they
do
not
understand
i
might
have
noticed
that
i
have
used
the
term
study
of
nature
but
it
can
not
be
called
a
it
a
pastime
of
sheer
delight
with
naught
but
beautiful
dreams
and
lovely
thoughts
where
we
are
urged
forward
by
the
fact
that
we
are
in
god
world
which
he
made
for
us
to
be
our
comfort
in
time
of
trouble
language
can
not
express
the
joy
and
happy
forgetfulness
during
a
ramble
in
the
country
i
do
not
mean
that
all
the
ins
and
outs
and
exact
knowledge
of
a
naturalist
are
necessary
to
produce
such
delight
but
merely
the
common
objects
sun
thrush
grasshopper
primrose
and
dew
s
and
i
have
made
a
little
hut
in
the
woods
out
of
a
large
natural
hole
in
the
ground
by
a
big
tree
we
have
pulled
down
branches
all
around
it
and
stuck
in
upright
sticks
as
a
paling
we
are
training
ivy
to
grow
over
the
sticks
we
smoke
pioneer
cigarettes
here
and
hide
the
packets
in
a
hole
under
the
roots
of
the
tree
it
like
a
sort
of
cupboard
in
the
evening
s
and
i
cycled
to
s
and
when
it
was
dark
we
went
down
on
the
rocks
and
lit
a
fire
which
crackled
and
burnt
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
intend
to
do
a
bit
to
beetles
these
hols
rev
j
wood
in
the
has
incited
me
to
take
them
up
and
it
is
really
time
for
at
present
i
am
as
ignorant
as
i
can
hang
together
of
the
coleoptera
went
out
with
l
to
try
to
see
the
squirrels
again
we
could
not
find
one
and
were
just
wondering
if
we
should
draw
blank
when
l
noticed
one
clinging
to
the
bark
of
a
tree
with
a
nut
in
its
mouth
we
gave
it
a
good
chase
but
it
escaped
into
the
thickest
part
of
the
fir
tree
still
carrying
the
nut
and
we
gave
up
firing
at
it
later
on
l
got
foolishly
mischievous
owing
i
suppose
to
our
lack
of
sport
and
unhinged
a
gate
which
he
carried
two
yards
into
a
copse
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
just
then
he
saw
the
squirrel
again
and
jumped
over
the
hedge
into
the
copse
chasing
it
from
tree
to
tree
with
his
catty
having
lost
it
he
climbed
a
fir
tree
into
a
squirrel
drey
at
the
top
and
sat
there
on
the
three
top
and
i
below
was
just
going
to
lift
the
gate
back
when
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
farmer
watching
me
menacing
and
silent
i
promptly
dropped
the
gate
and
fled
l
from
his
drey
not
knowing
what
had
happened
called
out
to
me
about
the
nest
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
the
man
looked
up
and
asked
him
who
he
was
and
who
i
was
l
would
not
say
and
would
not
come
down
the
farmer
said
he
would
come
up
l
answered
that
if
he
did
he
would
gob
spit
on
him
eventually
l
climbed
down
and
asked
the
farmer
for
a
glass
of
cider
the
latter
gave
him
his
boot
and
l
ran
away
went
to
the
meet
of
the
stag
hounds
saw
a
hind
in
the
stream
at
l
with
not
a
horse
hound
or
man
in
sight
it
looked
quite
unconcerned
and
did
not
seem
to
have
been
hunted
i
tried
to
head
it
but
a
confounded
got
there
before
me
and
drove
it
off
in
the
wrong
direction
i
mad
because
if
i
had
succeeded
in
heading
it
and
had
there
been
a
kill
i
should
have
got
a
slot
got
home
at
after
running
and
walking
fifteen
miles
tired
out
just
read
of
stalky
beetle
and
mcturk
i
like
beetle
best
won
the
school
gymnasium
championship
under
fifteen
had
quite
an
adventure
d
and
i
cycled
to
the
lighthouse
at
on
the
way
in
crossing
the
sands
near
the
hospital
ship
we
espied
a
lame
curlew
which
could
hardly
fly
i
gave
chase
but
it
managed
to
scramble
over
a
gut
full
of
water
about
two
yards
wide
d
took
off
his
boots
and
stockings
and
carried
me
over
on
his
back
and
we
both
raced
across
the
sands
to
where
the
curlew
lay
in
an
exhausted
state
i
picked
him
up
and
carried
him
off
under
my
arm
like
the
boy
with
the
goose
that
laid
the
golden
eggs
all
the
time
the
bird
screamed
loudly
opening
its
enormously
long
bill
and
struggling
to
escape
arrived
at
the
gut
again
we
found
that
the
incoming
tide
had
made
the
gut
wider
and
deeper
so
that
we
were
cut
off
from
the
mainland
and
found
it
necessary
to
wade
across
at
once
before
it
got
deeper
as
i
had
to
carry
a
pair
of
as
well
as
my
boots
and
stockings
i
handed
over
the
struggling
bird
to
d
while
wading
across
i
suddenly
sank
to
my
waist
in
a
sandpit
this
frightened
me
and
i
was
glad
to
reach
the
other
side
in
safety
but
on
arrival
i
found
d
but
no
curlew
in
wading
across
the
current
he
grew
flurried
and
let
it
go
the
tide
swept
it
upstream
and
the
poor
bird
i
fear
perished
by
drowning
knocked
up
my
friend
p
who
is
skipper
of
the
ship
and
asked
him
if
he
had
a
fire
so
that
i
could
dry
myself
he
replied
that
they
had
no
fire
but
that
his
missus
would
look
out
a
pair
of
pants
for
me
before
falling
in
with
this
plan
unconditionally
i
thought
it
best
to
inspect
the
garment
however
it
was
quite
clean
a
pair
of
blue
serge
seaman
trousers
very
baggy
in
the
seat
and
far
too
long
but
i
turned
up
the
bottoms
and
hid
the
baggy
part
underneath
my
overcoat
so
i
got
back
home
wet
all
day
toothache
toothache
toothache
toothache
mother
and
dad
wanted
to
give
me
one
of
henty
but
fearing
lest
i
did
not
want
it
they
did
not
put
my
name
in
it
so
that
if
i
wished
i
could
change
it
intend
doing
this
am
reading
the
of
it
requires
careful
study
but
i
understand
it
so
far
and
shall
go
on
i
have
caught
nothing
in
my
traps
yet
a
little
while
ago
i
set
a
springe
and
two
nooses
in
the
reed
bed
for
water
rails
i
have
bought
a
book
on
practical
trapping
i
am
thinking
that
on
the
whole
i
am
a
most
discontented
mortal
i
get
fits
of
what
i
call
what
the
good
of
anything
mania
i
keep
asking
myself
incessantly
till
the
question
wears
me
out
what
the
good
of
going
into
the
country
what
the
good
of
studying
so
hard
where
is
it
going
to
end
will
it
lead
anywhere
when
i
can
get
hold
of
any
one
interested
in
natural
history
i
talk
away
in
the
most
garrulous
manner
and
afterwards
feel
ashamed
of
myself
for
doing
it
in
answer
to
my
letter
advises
me
to
join
one
of
the
ordinary
professions
and
then
follow
up
nat
history
as
a
recreation
or
else
join
science
classes
at
kensington
or
else
by
influence
get
a
post
in
the
natural
history
museum
but
i
shall
see
during
dinner
hour
between
morning
and
afternoon
school
went
out
on
the
s
b
river
bank
and
found
another
sedge
warbler
nest
this
is
the
fifth
i
have
found
this
year
people
who
live
opposite
on
the
t
v
hear
them
sing
at
night
and
think
they
are
nightingales
on
reviewing
the
past
i
find
in
all
i
have
discovered
nests
belonging
to
species
i
only
hope
i
shall
be
as
successful
with
the
a
hot
sultry
afternoon
during
most
of
which
i
was
stretched
out
on
the
grass
beside
an
upturned
stone
where
a
battle
royal
was
fought
between
yellow
and
black
ants
the
victory
went
to
the
hardy
little
yellows
by
the
way
i
held
a
newt
by
the
tail
and
it
emitted
a
squeak
so
that
the
newt
has
a
voice
after
all
in
bed
with
a
feverish
cold
i
am
afraid
i
have
very
few
nat
his
observations
to
make
it
is
hard
to
observe
anything
at
all
when
lying
in
bed
in
a
dull
bedroom
with
one
small
window
gulls
and
starlings
pass
steam
engines
whistle
horses
feet
clatter
down
the
street
and
sometimes
the
voice
of
a
reaches
me
and
often
the
loud
laugh
that
speaks
the
vacant
mind
i
can
also
hear
my
own
cough
echoing
through
my
head
and
by
the
evening
the
few
pages
of
lubbock
bees
and
which
i
struggled
to
get
through
during
the
day
rattle
through
my
brain
till
i
am
disgusted
to
find
i
have
them
by
heart
the
clock
strikes
midnight
and
i
wait
for
the
morning
oh
what
a
weary
world
down
with
another
cold
feeling
pretty
useless
it
a
wonder
i
develop
melancholia
by
h
and
i
were
down
on
the
mudflats
of
the
river
with
watching
waders
ringed
plover
in
great
numbers
i
have
always
had
one
ambition
to
be
a
great
naturalist
that
is
i
suppose
a
child
fancy
and
i
can
see
my
folly
in
hoping
for
such
great
things
still
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
become
a
naturalist
if
i
study
hard
i
hope
that
whatever
i
do
i
shall
do
in
the
hope
of
increasing
knowledge
of
truth
and
not
for
my
own
fame
this
entry
may
suggest
that
i
am
horribly
conceited
but
really
i
am
as
humble
as
possible
i
know
i
have
advanced
beyond
many
others
and
i
know
i
shall
advance
further
but
why
be
conceited
what
a
short
life
we
have
and
what
heaps
of
glorious
work
to
be
done
supper
bell
so
i
am
off
this
reads
like
isaac
walton
funny
mixtures
of
the
sublime
with
the
ridiculous
he
discusses
abstract
happiness
and
the
best
salmon
sauce
all
in
one
breath
although
it
is
a
grand
achievement
to
have
added
but
one
jot
or
tittle
to
the
sum
of
human
knowledge
it
is
grander
still
to
have
added
a
thought
it
is
best
for
a
man
to
try
to
be
both
poet
and
naturalist
not
to
be
too
much
of
a
naturalist
and
so
overlook
the
beauty
of
things
or
too
much
of
a
poet
and
so
fail
to
understand
them
or
even
perceive
those
hidden
beauties
only
revealed
by
close
observation
woke
up
this
morning
covered
with
spots
chest
inflamed
and
bad
cough
h
carted
me
down
from
the
attic
to
the
lower
bedroom
and
when
the
came
he
confirmed
the
general
opinion
that
i
had
measles
it
is
simply
disgusting
i
have
somewhere
near
spots
on
me
went
to
a
woods
where
strange
to
say
i
again
saw
mary
but
she
had
a
tribe
of
friends
with
her
so
did
not
speak
but
watched
her
from
a
distance
through
my
on
interviewing
my
old
friend
h
found
i
had
chickenpox
this
instead
of
being
a
diary
of
a
naturalist
observations
will
be
one
of
infectious
diseases
letter
from
editor
of
to
my
brother
saying
that
if
the
grew
he
might
be
able
to
offer
me
a
billet
meanwhile
he
will
be
able
to
get
along
with
his
pen
he
will
soon
make
a
living
and
in
time
too
a
name
this
is
a
bit
of
all
right
i
shall
always
be
on
the
for
a
job
on
a
journal
went
to
f
duckponds
flocks
of
wigeon
and
teal
on
the
water
taking
advantage
of
a
dip
in
the
land
managed
to
stalk
them
splendidly
and
for
quite
a
long
time
i
lay
among
the
long
grass
watching
them
through
my
but
during
the
day
wild
duck
are
not
particularly
lively
or
interesting
birds
they
just
rest
serenely
on
the
water
like
floating
corks
on
a
sheet
of
glass
occasionally
one
will
paddle
around
lazily
but
for
the
most
part
they
show
a
great
ennui
and
seem
so
sleepy
and
tired
that
one
would
almost
think
to
be
able
to
approach
and
feed
them
out
of
the
hand
but
i
moved
one
hand
carelessly
and
the
whole
flock
was
up
in
a
minute
and
whizzing
across
the
river
afterwards
at
dusk
on
returning
to
the
ponds
they
had
come
back
but
now
that
the
sun
was
down
those
dozy
flapdoodle
creatures
of
the
afternoon
were
transformed
into
quacking
quarrelsome
blustering
birds
that
squabbled
and
chivvied
each
other
every
moment
seizing
the
chance
of
a
luxurious
dip
flinging
the
water
off
their
backs
with
a
shake
of
the
tail
that
seemed
to
indicate
the
delight
it
was
now
quite
dark
a
snipe
rose
at
my
feet
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
coots
and
moorhens
clekked
and
a
little
grebe
grew
bold
and
began
to
dive
and
fish
quite
close
to
me
methodically
working
its
way
upstream
and
so
quartering
out
its
feeding
area
a
happy
alas
i
enjoy
these
moments
the
more
as
they
recede
not
often
do
i
realise
the
living
present
that
is
always
difficult
it
is
the
mere
shades
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
days
that
are
dearest
to
me
spent
my
last
day
at
school
de
quincey
says
or
was
it
johnson
that
whenever
we
do
anything
for
the
last
time
provided
we
have
done
it
regularly
for
years
before
we
are
a
little
melancholy
even
though
it
has
been
distasteful
to
us
true
signed
my
death
warrant
my
articles
apprenticing
me
to
journalism
for
five
years
by
jove
i
shall
work
frantically
during
the
next
five
years
so
as
to
be
ready
at
the
end
of
them
to
take
up
a
natural
history
appointment
up
to
the
journal
is
mainly
devoted
to
records
of
observations
in
general
natural
history
and
latterly
in
zoology
alone
as
long
as
he
has
good
health
a
man
need
never
despair
without
good
health
i
keep
a
long
while
in
the
race
yet
as
the
goal
of
my
ambition
grew
more
and
more
unattainable
i
should
surely
remember
the
words
of
keats
and
give
up
there
is
no
fiercer
hell
than
the
failure
of
a
great
ambition
have
been
reading
through
the
chemistry
course
in
the
harmsworth
and
learning
all
the
latest
facts
and
ideas
about
radium
i
would
rather
have
a
clear
comprehension
of
the
atom
as
a
solar
system
than
a
private
income
of
a
year
if
only
i
had
eyes
to
go
on
reading
without
a
stop
met
an
old
gentleman
in
e
a
naturalist
with
a
great
contempt
for
the
book
of
genesis
he
wanted
to
know
how
the
kangaroo
leapt
from
australia
to
palestine
and
how
noah
fed
the
animals
in
the
ark
he
rejects
the
old
theogony
and
advised
me
to
read
darwin
and
wood
silly
old
man
to
challacombe
and
then
walked
across
exmoor
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
been
on
exmoor
my
first
experience
of
the
moors
came
bursting
in
on
me
with
a
flood
of
ideas
impressions
and
delights
i
can
not
write
out
the
history
of
it
would
take
too
long
and
my
mind
is
a
palpitating
tangle
i
have
so
many
things
to
record
that
i
can
not
record
one
of
them
perhaps
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
draw
up
an
inventory
of
things
seen
and
heard
and
trust
to
my
memory
to
fill
in
the
details
when
in
the
future
i
revert
to
this
date
too
much
joy
like
too
much
pain
simply
makes
me
prostrate
it
wounds
the
organism
it
is
too
much
i
shall
try
to
forget
it
all
as
quickly
as
possible
so
as
to
be
able
to
return
to
and
the
sooner
as
a
calm
and
dispassionate
observer
yet
these
dear
old
hills
how
i
love
them
i
can
not
leave
them
without
one
friendly
word
i
wish
i
were
a
shepherd
at
the
ring
of
bells
had
a
long
yarn
with
the
landlord
who
as
he
told
us
the
story
of
his
life
was
constantly
interrupted
but
never
disconcerted
by
the
exuberant
loyalty
and
devotion
of
his
wife
a
stout
florid
creamy
woman
who
capped
every
story
with
ees
quite
honest
sir
no
at
all
in
old
joshua
a
of
i
spent
in
a
punt
under
a
copper
beech
out
of
the
pouring
rain
listening
to
lady
gamekeeper
at
a
talk
about
beasts
and
local
politics
just
after
a
visit
of
inspection
to
the
heronry
in
the
firs
on
the
island
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
it
was
delightful
to
hear
him
describing
a
heron
killing
an
eel
with
a
dap
on
the
niddick
helping
out
the
figure
with
a
pat
on
the
nape
of
his
thick
bull
neck
am
reading

brought
me
in

magnificent
aculeate

i
just
lifted
my
hat
and
passed
on
she
has
the
most
marvellous
brown
eyes
i
have
ever
seen
she
is
perfectly
a
bad
sign
this
when
i
feel
ill
cinema
pictures
of
the
circumstances
of
my
death
flit
across
my
mind
eye
i
can
not
prevent
them
i
consider
the
nature
of
the
disease
and
all
i
said
before
i
died
something
heroic
of
course
she
is
a
ripping
girl
her
eyes
are
magnificent
i
have
never
seen
any
one
better
looking
in
the
afternoon
dissected
a

following

marshall
book
am
studying
chemistry
and
attending
classes
at
the
evening
school
and
reading
physiology
foster
am
also
teaching
myself
german
i
wish
i
had
a
microscope
what
heaps
of
things
to
be
done
how
short
the
time
to
do
them
in
an
appetite
for
knowledge
is
apt
to
rush
one
off
one
feet
like
any
other
appetite
if
not
curbed
i
often
stand
in
the
centre
of
the
library
here
and
think
despairingly
how
impossible
it
is
ever
to
become
possessed
of
all
the
wealth
of
facts
and
ideas
contained
in
the
books
surrounding
me
on
every
hand
i
pull
out
one
volume
from
its
place
and
feel
as
if
i
were
no
more
than
giving
one
dig
with
a
pick
in
an
enormous
quarry
the
porter
spends
his
days
in
the
library
keeping
strict
vigil
over
this
catacomb
of
books
passing
along
between
the
shelves
and
yet
never
paying
heed
to
the
almost
audible
susurrus
of
desire
the
desire
every
book
has
to
be
taken
down
and
read
to
live
to
come
into
being
in
somebody
mind
he
even
hands
the
volumes
over
the
counter
seeks
them
out
in
their
proper
places
or
returns
them
there
without
once
realising
that
a
book
is
a
person
and
not
a
thing
it
makes
me
shudder
to
think
of
lamb
being
carted
about
as
if
they
were
fardels
dissected
an
eel
cassell
says
the
is
divided
this
is
not
so
in
the
one
i
opened
found
what
i
believe
to
be
the
lymphatic
heart
in
the
tail
beneath
the
vent
am
working
frantically
so
as
to
keep
up
my
own
work
with
the
daily
business
of
reporting
shorthand
german
chemistry
classes
electricity
lectures
zoology
including
dissections
and
field
work
am
reading
mosenthal
and
sectioned
a
leech
h
has
lent
me
a
hand
microtome
and
i
have
borrowed
an
old
razor
my
table
in
the
attic
is
now
fitted
up
quite
like
a
laboratory
i
get
up
every
morning
at
to
dissect
have
worked
at
the
anatomy
of
another
leech
and
all
collected
by
myself
the
branchial
basket
of
interested
me
vastly
but
it
a
brute
to
dissect
cycled
to
the
lighthouse
at
the
mouth
of
the
estuary
underneath
some
telegraph
wires
picked
up
a
landrail
in
excellent
condition
the
colour
of
the
wings
is
a
beautiful
warm
chestnut
while
sweeping
the
sandhills
with
my
in
search
of
ring
plover
which
nest
there
in
the
shingle
beaches
i
espied
a
shelduck
squatting
on
a
piece
of
level
ground
on
walking
up
cautiously
found
it
was
dead
a
drake
in
splendid
plumage
and
quite
fresh
and
uninjured
put
him
in
my
pocket
alongside
of
the
landrail
my
coat
looked
rather
bulgy
for
a
shelduck
is
nearly
as
big
as
a
goose
heard
a
grasshopper
warbler
a
rare
bird
in
north
later
after
much
patient
watching
saw
the
bird
in
a
bramble
bush
creeping
about
like
a
mouse
on
the
picked
up
a
number
of
sea
mice
and
bottled
them
in
my
jar
of
per
as
they
will
come
in
useful
for
dissection
also
found
the
cranium
of
a
which
i
will
describe
later
on
near
the
lighthouse
watched
some
fishermen
bring
in
a
large
salmon
in
a
seine
net
worked
from
the
shore
it
was
most
exciting
cycled
down
three
miles
of
hard
sand
with
the
wind
behind
me
to
the
village
where
i
had
tea
and
as
if
nothing
could
stay
good
luck
met
margaret
i
showed
her
one
by
one
all
my
treasures
rail
duck
skull
sea
mice
and
felt
like
thomas
edward
beloved
of
samuel
smiles
to
her
i
must
have
appeared
a
very
ridiculous
person
how
do
you
know
it
the
skull
of
a
she
asked
incredulous
how
do
i
know
anything
i
said
a
little
piqued
on
arriving
home
found
t
awaiting
me
with
the
news
that
he
had
discovered
a
woodpecker
nest
when
will
the
luck
cease
i
have
never
had
such
a
flawless
ten
hours
in
grand
these
summer
days
eat
into
my
being
the
sea
has
been
roaring
into
my
ears
and
the
sun
blazing
down
so
that
even
the
backs
of
my
hands
are
sunburnt
and
then
those
eyes
ah
me
she
pretty
dissected
the
sheldrake
very
entertained
to
discover
the
extraordinary
asymmetry
of
the
syrinx
dissected
corncrake
examining
carefully
the
pessulus
bronchidesmus
incomplete
and
membranes
of
a
very
interesting
syrinx
dissected
one
of
the
sea
mice
it
has
a
remarkable
series
of
hepatic
ducts
running
into
the
alimentary
canal
as
in
nudibranchs
in
the
among
the
oak
saplings
we
seemed
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
green
the
tall
green
grasses
threw
up
a
green
light
against
the
young
green
of
the
oaks
and
the
sun
managed
to
trickle
through
only
here
and
there
bevies
of
swinging
bluebells
grew
in
patches
among
the
grass
overhead
in
the
oaks
i
heard
secret
leaf
whispers
those
little
noiseless
noises
birds
and
trees
and
flowers
were
secretive
and
mysterious
like
expectant
motherhood
all
the
live
things
plotted
together
having
the
same
big
business
in
hand
out
in
the
sunlit
meadows
there
was
a
different
influence
abroad
here
everything
was
gay
lively
irresponsible
the
brook
prattled
like
an
inconsequential
schoolgirl
the
marsh
marigolds
in
flamboyant
yellow
sunbonnets

oak
sapling
should
make
an
elderly
man
avuncular
there
are
so
many
tremendous
possibilities
about
a
young
oak
that
it
is
tempting
to
put
a
hand
upon
its
shoulder
and
give
some
seasoned
timberly
advice
small
red
went
to
l
sessions
after
the
court
rose
i
transcribed
my
notes
quickly
and
walked
out
to
the
famous
valley
of
rocks
which
southey
described
as
the
ribs
of
the
old
earth
poking
through
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
hills
saw
a
snake
a
red
viper
put
my
boot
on
him
quickly
so
that
he
could
get
away
and
then
recognised
him
as
a
specimen
of
what
i
consider
to
be
the
fourth
species
of
british
serpent
the
difficulty
was
to
know
how
to
secure
him
this
species
is
more
ferocious
than
the
ordinary
and
i
did
not
like
the
idea
of
putting
my
hand
down
to
seize
him
by
the
neck
i
stood
for
some
time
with
my
foot
so
firmly
pressed
down
on
its
back
that
my
leg
ached
and
i
began
to
wonder
if
i
had
been
bitten
i
held
on
and
presently
hailed
a
baker
cart
coming
along
the
road
the
man
got
out
and
ran
across
the
grass
to
where
i
stood
i
showed
him
what
i
had
beneath
my
boot
and
he
produced
a
piece
of
string
which
i
fastened
around
the
snake
tail
and
so
gently
hauled
the
little
brute
up
it
already
appeared
moribund
but
i
squashed
its
head
on
the
grass
with
my
heel
to
make
certain
after
parting
with
the
baker
to
whom
all
thanks
be
given
i
remember
that
adders
are
tenacious
of
life
and
so
i
continue
to
carry
him
at
length
and
occasionally
wallop
him
against
a
stone
as
he
was
lifeless
i
wrapped
him
in
paper
and
put
him
in
my
pocket
though
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
i
left
the
string
on
and
let
its
end
hang
out
over
my
pocket
so
home
by
a
two
hours
railway
journey
with
the
adder
in
the
pocket
of
my
overcoat
and
the
overcoat
on
the
rack
over
my
head
settled
down
to
the
reading
of
a
book
on
spinoza
at
home
it
proved
to
be
quite
alive
and
on
being
pulled
out
by
the
string
coiled
up
on
the
floor
and
hissed
in
a
fury
to
my
infinite
surprise
finished
him
off
with
the
poker
and
so
spoilt
the
skin
have
had
toothache
for
a
week
too
much
of
a
coward
to
have
it
out
started
for
p
early
in
the
morning
to
report
duke
after
a
week
pain
felt
a
little
dicky
all
the
way
in
the
train
kept
hardening
myself
to
the
task
in
front
of
me
by
recollecting
the
example
of
zola
who
killed
pain
with
work
so
all
day
i
have
endeavoured
to
act
as
if
i
had
no
pain
the
worst
of
all
pains
toothache
by
the
time
i
got
home
i
was
rather
done
up
but
the
pain
was
actually
less
this
gave
me
a
furious
joy
and
after
days
of
morose
silence
at
supper
i
made
them
all
laugh
by
bursting
out
violently
with
i
know
whether
you
know
it
but
i
had
a
horrible
day
i
explained
at
length
and
received
the
healing
ointment
of
much
sympathy
went
to
bed
happy
with
tooth
still
aching
i
fear
it
was
scarcely
playing
the
strict
zolaesque
game
to
divulge
the
story
of
my
sufferings
no
i
am
not
a
martyr
or
a
saint
just
an
ordinary
devil
who
having
a
rough
time
had
a
glorious
time
on
the
rocks
at
low
tide
prawning
caught
some
rocklings
and
a
large
the
sun
did
not
simply
shine
it
came
rushing
down
from
the
sky
in
a
cataract
and
flooded
the
sands
with
light
sitting
on
a
rock
with
prawning
net
over
my
knees
i
looked
along
three
miles
of
flat
hard
and
yellow
sands
the
sun
poured
down
on
them
so
heavily
that
it
seemed
to
raise
a
luminous
golden
yellow
dust
for
about
three
feet
high
on
the
rocks
was
a
pretty
flapper
in
a
pink
sunbonnet
also
prawning
in
company
of
s
the
artist
who
has
sent
her
picture
to
the
royal
academy
they
saw
i
was
a
naturalist
so
my
services
were
secured
to
pronounce
my
judgment
on
a
fish
she
had
caught
it
was
a
squid
an
odd
little
beast
in
truth
as
she
said
the
same
class
of
animal
i
volunteered
as
the
cuttlefish
and
octopus
does
it
sting
oh
no
well
it
ought
to
with
a
face
like
that
she
laughed
merrily
and
the
bearded
but
youthful
artist
laughed
too
i
do
know
anything
about
these
things
he
said
hopelessly
nor
i
said
the
naturalist
modestly
i
study
fish
this
was
puzzling
fish
what
was
a
squid
then
the
artist
would
stop
now
and
then
and
raise
his
glasses
at
a
passing
ship
and
maud
face
occasionally
disappeared
in
the
pink
sunbonnet
as
she
stooped
over
a
pool
to
examine
a
seaweed
or
crab
she
a
dear
and
she
gave
me
the
squid
what
a
merry
little
cuss
went
with
uncle
to
see
a
wesleyan
minister
whose
fame
as
a
microscopist
according
to
uncle
made
it
worth
my
while
to
visit
him
as
i
expected
he
was
just
a
silly
old
man
a
diatomaniac
fond
of
slides
and
not
a
scientific
man
at
all
he
lectures
bands
of
hope
on
the
butterfly
life
history
and
hates
his
neighbour
who
is
also
a
microscopist
and
incidentally
a
scientific
man
because
he
interests
himself
in
parasites
and
those
beastly
things
i
remarked
that
his
friend
next
door
had
shown
me
an
amphioxus
oh
i
expect
that
some
beastly
bacteria
thing
he
said
petulantly
i
ca
understand
wilkinson
he
a
pervert
i
told
him
what
was
and
laughed
up
my
sleeve
he
likes
to
think
of
zoology
as
a
series
of
pretty
pictures
illustrating
beautiful
moral
truths
the
old
fellow
saving
grace
was
enthusiasm
having
focused
an
object
for
us
he
would
stand
by
breathless
while
we
squinted
down
his
and
gave
vent
to
tremendous
expletives
of
surprise
such
as
heavens
or
jupiter
his
eyes
would
twinkle
with
delight
and
straightway
another
miracle
is
selected
for
us
to
view
they
are
all
miracles
he
said
those
are
the
valves
washing
his
hands
with
invisible
soap
no
one
has
yet
been
able
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
diatom
valves
no
one
knows
what
they
are
no
nor
ever
will
know
why
why
ca
we
see
behind
the
valves
because
god
is
behind
the
valves
that
is
why

of

and
covered
with
trinkets
the

a
tremendous

over

lying
in
it
made
me
think
i
was
an

read

till
the

and
then
found
i
had
left
my
handbag
downstairs
lit
a

and
went

considerable
noise

looking

and
see

dissect

cast

on

basket
such
structures
strike
me
as
being
as

exquisite
as

with

of

to
do
any
nesting
here
are
some
of
the
things
i
saw
the
bark
on
several
of
the
trees
in
the
mazzard
orchards
rubbed
into
a
beautifully
smooth
polished
surface
by
the
red
devon
cows
when
scratching
where
it
itched
i
put
my
hand
on
the
smooth
almost
patch
of
bark
and
felt
delighted
and
grateful
that
cows
had
fleas
the
young
shoots
of
the
plants
on
the
hill
were
red
tipped
with
the
gold
of
an
almost
horizontal
sun
i
caught
a
little
lizard
which
slipped
across
my
path
afar
off
down
in
the
valley
i
had
come
through
in
a
convenient
break
in
a
holly
bush
i
could
just
see
a
cow
sitting
on
her
matronly
haunches
in
a
field
she
flicked
her
ears
and
two
starlings
settled
on
her
back
a
rabbit
swept
out
of
a
bush
and
a
magpie
flew
out
of
the
hedge
on
my
right
in
another
direction
i
could
see
a
field
full
of
luscious
tall
green
grass
every
stalk
was
so
full
of
sap
that
had
i
cut
one
i
am
sure
it
would
have
bled
great
green
drops
in
the
field
some
lambs
were
sleeping
one
woke
up
and
looked
at
me
with
the
back
of
its
head
to
the
low
sun
which
shone
through
its
two
small
ears
and
gave
them
a
transparent
pink
appearance
no
sooner
am
i
rebaptized
in
the
sun
than
i
have
to
be
turning
home
again
no
sooner
do
the
sudden
lilies
push
between
the
loosening
fibres
of
the
heart
than
i
am
whisked
back
into
the
old
groove
the
daily
round
if
only
i
had
more
time
more
time
in
which
to
think
to
love
to
observe
to
frame
my
disposition
to
direct
as
far
as
in
me
lies
the
development
and
unfolding
of
my
character
if
only
i
could
direct
all
my
energies
to
the
great
and
difficult
profession
of
life
of
being
man
instead
of
trifling
with
one
profession
that
bores
me

the

at

take
another
walk
as
the
smell
of
albert
tobacco
together
with
that
of
his
stockinged
feet
and
his
boots
removed
was
asphyxiating
the
governess
is
an
awfully
pretty
girl
we
have
been
talking
together
and
she
asked
me
if
i
were
a
naturalist
i
said
yes
she
said
well
i
found
a
funny
little
beetle
yesterday
and
s
said
i
ought
to
have
given
it
to
you
later
i
felt
she
was
looking
at
me
so
i
looked
at
her
across
the
beach
yes
it
was
true
when
our
eyes
met
she
gave
me
one
of
the
most
provokingly
pretty
smiles
then
turned
and
went
up
the
cliff
path
and
so
out
of
my
life
to
my
everlasting
regret
return
in
a
cattle
steamer
called
in
the
office
and
seeing
dad
typing
said
are
you
mr
barbellion
dad
replied
in
the
affirmative
whereupon
the
doctor
handed
him
his
card
and
dad
said
he
thought
it
was
his
son
he
wanted
to
see
he
is
an
old
gentleman
aged
eighty
or
thereabouts
with
boots
an
umbrella
and
a
guardian
nephew
a
youngster
of
about
sixty
but
i
paid
him
due
reverence
as
a
celebrated
zoologist
and
at
his
invitation
and
to
my
infinite
pride
accompanied
him
on
an
excursion
to
the
coast
where
he
wanted
to
see
which
i
readily
turned
up
for
him
i
chanced
to
remark
that
i
thought
torsion
in
gastropods
one
of
the
most
fascinating
and
difficult
problems
in
zoology
why
should
a
snail
be
twisted
round
humph
said
he
why
do
we
stand
upright
i
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
argue
with
him
so
pretended
his
reply
was
a
but
it
enabled
me
to
size
him
up
intellectually
in
the
evening
dined
with
him
at
his
hotel
he
knows
wallace
and
haeckel
personally
and
i
sat
at
his
feet
with
my
tongue
out
listening
to
personal
reminiscences
of
these
great
men
however
he
seemed
never
to
have
heard
of
gaskell
theory
on
the
origin
of
vertebrates
walked
to
v
as
usual
nature
with
clockwork
regularity
had
all
her
taps
turned
on
larks
singing
cherries
ripening
and
bees
humming
it
all
bored
me
a
little
why
does
she
vary
it
a
little
a
cold
note
from
saying
that
he
can
not
undertake
the
responsibility
of
advising
me
to
give
up
journalism
for
zoology
a
hellish
cold
in
the
head
also
a
swingeing
inflammation
of
the
eyes
just
heard
them
singing
in
the
chapel
over
the
way
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
hope
so
i
sure
a
transformation
after
a
long
series
of
drab
experiences
in
sheffield
the
last
being
the
climax
of
yesterday
an
arrived
this
morning
and
i
sailed
like
an
eagle
into
cloudless
windless
weather
has
published
my
article
my
cold
is
suddenly
better
and
going
down
by
the
sea
this
afternoon
met
mary
had
an
amusing
letter
from
my
f
who
does
not
like
the
agnostic
atmosphere
in
my
article
poor
dear
she
is
sorry
if
i
really
feel
like
that
and
if
i
do
what
a
pity
to
put
it
into
print
then
a
bible
reference
to
the
epistle
to
the
romans
feeling
ill
like
a
sloppy
tadpole
my
will
is
paralysed
i
visit
the
doctor
regularly
to
be
stethoscoped
ramble
about
the
streets
idly
scan
magazines
in
the
library
and
occasionally
rink
with
palpitation
of
the
heart
as
a
consequence
in
view
of
the
shortness
bitterness
and
uncertainty
of
life
all
scientific
labour
for
me
seems
futile
better
but
still
very
dicky
a
pallid
animal
a
weevil
in
a
nut
i
have
a
weak
heart
an
enervated
nervous
system
i
suffer
from
lack
of
funds
with
which
to
carry
on
my
studies
i
hate
particularly
some
speaker
like
and
last
but
not
least
there
are
women
all
these
worries
fight
over
my
body
like
jackals
over
carrion
yet
zoology
is
all
i
want
why
life
leave
me
alone
reading
hardy
novels
he
is
altogether
delightful
in
the
subtlety
with
which
he
lets
you
perceive
the
first
tiny
love
presentiments
between
his
heroes
and
heroines
the
casual
touch
of
the
hands
the
peep
of
a
foot
or
ankle
underneath
the
skirt
all
these
in
hardy
signify
the
cloud
no
bigger
than
a
man
hand
they
are
the
susurrus
of
the
breeze
before
the
storm
and
you
await
what
is
to
follow
with
palpitating
heart
for
days
past
have
been
living
in
a
state
of
mental
ebullition
all
kinds
of
pictures
of
love
life
and
death
have
been
passing
through
my
mind
now
i
am
too
indolent
and
nerveless
to
set
them
down
physically
i
am
such
a
wreck
that
to
carry
out
the
least
intention
such
as
putting
on
my
boots
i
have
to
flog
my
will
like
an
arab
with
a
slave
in
a
sand
of
ayaman
three
months
ago
when
i
got
up
before
breakfast
to
dissect
rabbits
dogfish
frogs
newts
this
would
have
seemed
impossible
still
visit
surgery
each
week
i
have
two
dull
spots
at
the
bottom
of
each
lung
what
a
fine
expressive
word
is
let
me
write
it
gloom
one
evening
coming
home
in
the
train
from
l
county
sessions
i
noticed
a
horrible
wheezy
sound
whenever
i
breathed
deep
i
was
scared
out
of
my
life
and
at
once
thought
of
consumption
went
to
the
next
day
and
he
sounded
me
and
reassured
me
i
was
afraid
to
tell
him
of
the
little
wheezy
sound
at
the
apex
of
each
lung
and
i
believed
he
overlooked
it
so
next
day
very
harassed
i
went
back
to
him
again
and
told
him
he
noticed
it
and
looked
glum
have
to
keep
out
of
doors
as
much
as
possible
the
intense
internal
life
i
lead
worrying
about
my
health
reading
eternally
reading
reflecting
observing
feeling
loving
and
hating
with
no
outlet
for
superfluous
steam
cramped
and
confined
on
every
side
without
any
friends
or
influence
of
any
sort
without
even
any
acquaintances
excepting
my
colleagues
in
journalism
whom
i
contemn
all
this
will
turn
me
into
the
most
conceited
mawkish
gauche
creature
in
existence
the
facts
are
undeniable
life
is
pain
no
sophistry
can
win
me
over
to
any
other
view
and
yet
years
ago
i
set
out
so
hopefully
and
healthfully
what
are
birds
eggs
to
me
my
ambition
is
enormous
but
vague
i
am
too
distributed
in
my
abilities
ever
to
achieve
distinction
had
a
letter
from
the
keeper
of
zoology
at
the
british
museum
advising
me
of
three
vacancies
in
his
and
asking
me
if
i
would
like
to
try
etc
so
that
visit
to
me
bore
some
fruit
spent
the
morning
perhaps
this
is
the
flood
tide
at
last
i
shall
work
like
a
drayhorse
to
pull
through
if
i
am
nominated
i
await
developments
in
a
frightfully
turbulent
state
of
mind
i
have
a
frantic
desire
to
control
the
factors
which
are
going
to
affect
my
future
so
permanently
and
this
ferocious
desire
of
course
collides
with
a
crash
all
day
long
with
the
fact
that
however
much
i
desire
there
will
still
remain
the
unalterable
logic
of
events
how
delicious
all
this
seemed
to
be
alive
thinking
seeing
enjoying
walking
eating
all
quite
apart
from
the
amount
of
money
in
your
purse
or
the
prospects
of
a
career
i
revelled
in
the
sensuous
enjoyment
of
my
animal
existence
up
to
now
my
life
has
been
one
of
great
internal
strife
and
struggle
the
struggle
with
a
great
ambition
and
a
weak
will
unequal
to
the
task
of
coping
with
it
i
have
planned
on
too
big
a
scale
perhaps
i
have
put
too
great
a
strain
on
my
talents
i
have
whipped
a
flagging
will
i
have
been
for
ever
cogitating
worrying
devising
means
of
escape
meanwhile
the
moments
have
gone
by
unheeded
and
unenjoyed
legginess
is
bad
enough
in
a
woman
but
bandy
legginess
is
impossible
solitude
is
good
for
the
soul
after
an
hour
of
it
i
feel
as
lofty
and
imperial
as
marcus
aurelius
the
best
girl
in
the
best
dress
immediately
looks
disreputable
if
her
stockings
be
downgyved
some
old
people
on
reaching
a
certain
age
go
on
living
out
of
habit
a
bad
habit
too
how
much
i
can
learn
of
a
stranger
by
his
laugh
bees
poppies
and
swallows
and
all
they
mean
to
him
who
really
knows
them
or
a
white
gull
on
a
piece
of
floating
timber
or
a
troop
of
shiny
rooks
close
on
the
heels
of
a
ploughman
on
a
sunny
autumn
day
my
egoism
appals
me
likewise
the
extreme
intensification
of
the
consciousness
of
myself
whenever
i
walk
down
the
high
street
on
a
market
day
my
magnifies
my
proportions
to
the
size
of
a
gulliver
so
that
it
is
grievous
to
reflect
that
in
spite
of
that
the
townsfolk
see
me
only
as
an
insignificant
bourgeois
youth
who
reports
meetings
in
shorthand
we
sang
in
church
but
when
i
know
thee
as
thou
art
praise
thee
as
i
ought
exactly
till
then
farewell
we
are
a
great
little
people
we
humans
if
there
be
no
next
world
still
the
spirit
of
man
will
have
lived
and
uttered
its
protest
simian
how
i
hate
the
man
who
talks
about
the
brute
creation
with
an
ugly
emphasis
on
only
christians
are
capable
of
it
as
for
me
i
am
proud
of
my
close
kinship
with
other
animals
i
take
a
jealous
pride
in
my
simian
ancestry
i
like
to
think
that
i
was
once
a
magnificent
hairy
fellow
living
in
the
trees
and
that
my
frame
has
come
down
through
geological
time
sea
jelly
and
worms
and
amphioxus
fish
dinosaurs
and
apes
who
would
exchange
these
for
the
pallid
couple
in
the
garden
of
eden
i
do
not
ever
like
going
to
bed
for
me
each
day
ends
in
a
little
sorrow
i
hate
the
time
when
it
comes
to
put
my
books
away
to
knock
out
my
pipe
and
say
exchanging
the
vivid
pleasures
of
the
day
for
the
darkness
of
sleep
and
oblivion
spent
the
afternoon
and
evening
till
ten
in
the
woods
with
mary
had
tea
in
the
haunted
house
and
after
sat
in
the
green
arbor
until
dark
when
i
kissed
her
achilles
was
not
the
worse
warrior
for
his
probation
in
petticoats
i
hope
to
goodness
she
does
think
i
want
to
marry
her
in
the
park
in
the
dark
kissing
her
i
was
testing
and
experimenting
with
a
new
experience
last
evening
after
much
mellifluous
cajolery
induced
her
to
my
private
opinion
about
this
whole
affair
is
that
all
the
time
i
have
been
at
least
twenty
degrees
below
real
love
heat
in
any
case
i
am
constitutionally
and
emotionally
unfaithful
i
said
things
which
i
did
not
believe
just
because
it
was
dark
and
she
was
charming
read
thomas
à
kempis
in
the
train
it
made
me
so
angry
i
nearly
flung
it
out
of
the
window
meddle
not
with
things
that
be
too
deep
for
thee
he
says
but
read
such
things
as
yield
compunction
to
the
heart
rather
than
elevation
to
the
head
forsooth
ca
you
see
me
a
puzzling
afternoon
weather
perfect
the
earth
green
and
humming
like
a
top
yet
a
web
of
dream
overlaid
the
great
hill
and
at
certain
moments
which
recurred
in
a
kind
of
pulsation
accompanied
by
subjective
feelings
of
vague
strife
and
effort
i
easily
succeeded
in
letting
all
i
saw
the
field
and
the
blackberry
bush
the
whole
valley
and
the
apple
orchards
change
into
something
unreal
flimsy
gauzelike
immaterial
and
totally
unexperienced
suddenly
when
the
impression
was
most
vivid
the
whole
of
this
mysterious
tapestry
would
vanish
away
and
i
was
back
where
and
make
oh
earth
how
jealously
you
guard
your
secrets
sat
at
the
civil
service
commission
in
burlington
house
for
the
exam
for
the
vacancy
in
the
no
luck
at
all
with
the
papers
the
whole
of
my
nine
months
assiduous
preparation
helped
me
in
only
two
questions
in
fine
i
have
not
succeeded
i
shall
not
obtain
the
appointment
and
in
a
few
weeks
i
shall
be
back
in
the
wilds
of
n
again
under
the
old
regime
reporting
platitudes
from
greasy
guardians
of
the
poor
and
receiving
condolences
from
people
not
altogether
displeased
at
some
one
else
misfortune
returned
home
from
london
felt
horribly
defeated
in
crossing
the
threshold
it
was
so
obviously
after
an
unsuccessful
flight
dissected
a
for
which
i
paid
to
the
plymouth
marine
laboratory
am
attempting
to
feel
after
some
practical
philosophy
of
living
something
that
will
enable
me
to
accept
disappointment
with
equanimity
and
town
council
meetings
with
a
broad
and
tolerant
smile
at
present
ambition
consumes
me
i
was
ambitious
before
i
was
breeched
i
can
remember
wondering
as
a
child
if
i
were
a
young
macaulay
or
ruskin
and
secretly
deciding
that
i
was
my
infant
mind
even
was
bitter
with
those
who
insisted
on
regarding
me
as
a
normal
child
and
not
as
a
prodigy
since
then
i
have
struggled
with
this
canker
for
many
a
day
and
as
success
fails
to
arrive
it
becomes
more
gnawing
in
the
morning
a
town
council
and
in
the
afternoon
a
rural
council
with
this
abominable
trash
in
my
notebook
waiting
to
be
written
up
and
turned
into
copy
and
with
the
dream
pictures
of
a
quiet
studious
life
in
cromwell
road
not
yet
faded
from
my
mind
where
can
i
turn
for
consolation
that
i
have
done
my
best
that
only
a
mother
saying
to
her
child
perhaps
after
all
it
is
a
narrow
life
this
diving
and
delving
among
charming
little
secrets
plying
diligently
scalpel
and
microscope
and
then
weaving
the
facts
obtained
into
theoretic
finespun
it
is
all
vastly
entertaining
to
the
naturalist
but
it
leaves
the
world
unmoved
i
sometimes
envy
the
zealot
with
a
definite
mission
in
life
life
without
one
seems
void
the
monotonous
pursuit
of
our
daily
vocations
the
soldier
sailor
so
they
go
on
never
living
but
only
working
never
thinking
but
only
hypnotising
themselves
by
the
routine
and
punctuality
of
their
lives
into
just
so
many
mechanical
toys
warranted
to
go
for
so
long
and
then
stop
when
death
takes
them
it
amazes
me
that
men
must
spend
their
precious
days
of
existence
for
the
most
part
in
slaving
for
food
and
clothing
and
the
bare
necessaries
of
existence
to
sum
up
my
despondency
what
the
good
of
such
a
life
where
does
it
lead
where
am
i
going
why
should
i
work
what
means
this
procession
of
nights
and
days
wherein
we
are
all
seen
moving
along
intent
and
stern
as
if
we
had
some
purpose
or
a
goal
of
course
to
the
man
who
believes
in
the
next
world
and
a
personal
god
it
is
quite
another
matter
the
christian
is
the
egoist
he
does
not
mind
annihilation
by
arduous
labour
in
this
world
if
in
the
next
he
shall
have
won
eternal
life
he
is
reckless
of
extravagant
in
the
expenditure
of
his
life
this
intolerable
fellow
will
be
cheerful
in
a
dungeon
for
he
flatters
himself
that
god
almighty
up
in
heaven
is
all
the
time
watching
through
the
keyhole
and
marking
him
down
for
eternal
life
the
cynical
man
who
studies
la
rochefoucauld
and
prides
himself
on
a
knowledge
of
human
motives
is
pleased
to
point
out
that
every
action
and
every
motive
is
selfish
from
the
philanthropist
who
advertises
himself
by
his
charities
to
the
fanatic
who
lays
down
his
life
for
a
cause
even
secret
charities
for
they
give
pleasure
to
the
doer
so
your
cynic
thinks
he
has
thus
with
one
stroke
of
his
psychological
scalpel
laid
human
nature
bare
in
all
its
depravities
all
he
has
done
really
is
to
reclassify
motives
instead
of
grouping
them
as
selfish
and
unselfish
which
is
more
convenient
he
lumps
them
together
as
selfish
a
method
by
which
even
he
is
forced
to
recognise
different
grades
of
selfishness
for
example
the
selfishness
of
a
is
lower
than
the
selfishness
of
a
man
who
gives
up
his
life
for
another
the
result
arrived
as
i
thought
i
have
failed
being
fourth
with
only
three
vacancies
it
is
useless
to
bewail
the
course
of
fortune
it
can
not
be
much
credit
to
possess
though
we
may
covet
those
precious
things
to
possess
which
depends
on
circumstances
outside
our
control
dined
at
the
devonshire
club
in
james
street
with
h
and
the
latter
showing
the
grave
symptomatic
phenomena
of
a
monocle
and
spats
a
dinner
of
eight
courses
only
made
one
mistake
put
my
salad
on
my
dish
instead
of
on
the
side
dish
horribly
nervous
and
reticent
i
was
apparently
expected
to
give
an
account
of
myself
and
my
abilities
and
with
that
end
in
view
they
gave
me
a
few
pokes
in
my
cranial
ribs
but
i
am
a
peculiar
animal
and
before
unbosoming
myself
i
would
require
a
happier
than
a
west
end
club
and
a
more
tactful
method
of
approach
than
ogling
by
two
professors
who
seemed
to
think
i
was
a
simple
machine
i
froze
from
sheer
nervousness
and
nothing
resulted
returned
home
and
found
a
letter
awaiting
me
from
a
offering
me
a
year
for
a
temporary
job
as
assistant
at
the
plymouth
marine
laboratory
left
london
horribly
depressed
they
evidently
intend
to
shuffle
me
off
read
geo
gissing
novel
in
godwin
peak
with
his
intense
pride
of
individuality
capacities
and
sentimental
languishment
reminds
me
of
myself
a
purulent
cold
in
the
nose
my
heart
is
weak
palpitation
after
the
least
exertion
but
i
shall
soon
be
swinging
my
cudgels
in
the
battle
of
life
so
it
wo
do
to
be
hypochondriacal
let
all
the
powers
of
the
world
and
the
devil
attack
me
yet
i
will
win
in
the
end
though
the
conquest
may
very
well
be
one
which
no
one
but
myself
will
view
have
accepted
the
plymouth
appointment
struggling
in
the
depths
again
within
the
past
few
days
with
heart
attacks
am
slowly
getting
better
of
them
and
trying
to
forget
as
soon
as
may
be
visions
of
sudden
death
coffins
and
obituary
notices
at
first
when
we
are
very
young
death
arouses
our
curiosity
as
it
did
cain
in
the
beginning
it
is
a
strange
and
very
rare
phenomenon
which
we
can
not
comprehend
and
every
time
we
hear
of
some
one
death
we
try
to
recall
that
person
appearance
in
life
and
are
disappointed
if
we
ca
the
endeavour
is
to
discover
what
it
is
this
death
to
compare
two
things
the
idea
of
the
person
alive
and
the
idea
of
him
dead
at
last
some
one
we
know
well
dies
and
that
is
the
first
shock
i
shall
never
forget
when
our
matron
died
at
the
d
school
as
the
years
roll
on
we
get
used
to
the
man
with
the
scythe
and
an
death
is
only
a
bit
of
gossip
suppose
the
hellfire
of
the
orthodox
really
existed
we
have
no
assurance
that
it
does
not
it
seems
incredible
but
many
incredible
things
are
true
we
do
not
that
god
is
not
as
cruel
as
a
spanish
inquisitor
suppose
then
he
is
if
after
death
we
wicked
ones
were
shovelled
into
a
furnace
of
fire
we
should
have
to
burn
there
would
be
no
redress
it
would
simply
be
the
divine
order
of
things
it
is
outrageous
that
we
should
be
so
helpless
and
so
dependent
on
any
one
even
god
sometimes
i
think
i
am
going
mad
i
live
for
days
in
the
mystery
and
tears
of
things
so
that
the
commonest
object
the
most
familiar
face
even
my
own
become
ghostly
unreal
enigmatic
i
get
into
an
attitude
of
almost
total
scepticism
nescience
solipsism
even
in
a
world
of
dumb
things
that
can
not
explain
themselves
the
discovery
of
how
i
am
situated
a
sentient
being
on
a
globe
in
space
overshadows
me
i
wish
i
were
just
nothing
while
at
a
public
meeting
the
approached
me
and
immediately
whispered
without
hesitation
just
had
a
telephone
message
to
say
that
your
father
is
at
the
t
railway
station
lying
senseless
he
has
evidently
had
an
apoplectic
fit
how
those
brutal
words
lying
senseless
banged
and
bullied
and
knocked
me
down
mother
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
door
in
a
dreadful
state
and
expecting
the
worst
met
the
train
with
the
doctor
and
took
him
home
in
the
cab
still
alive
thank
god
but
helpless
he
was
brave
enough
to
smile
and
shake
me
by
the
hand
with
his
left
though
he
was
speechless
and
the
right
side
of
his
body
helpless
a
porter
discovered
him
at
the
railway
terminus
lying
on
the
floor
of
a
carriage
he
is
a
trifle
better
it
is
fifteen
years
since
he
had
the
first
paralytic
stroke
am
taking
over
all
his
work
and
have
written
at
once
resigning
the
plymouth
appointment
it
really
did
require
an
effort
to
go
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
and
say
cheerfully
i
was
not
going
to
after
all
and
that
the
matter
was
of
no
consequence
to
me
i
laughed
gaily
and
dad
was
relieved
a
thundering
good
joke
what
annoys
me
is
that
other
folk
the
brainless
heartless
mob
as
schopenhauer
remarks
still
continue
to
regard
me
as
one
of
themselves
i
had
nearly
escaped
into
a
seaside
laboratory
and
now
suddenly
to
be
flung
back
into
the
dirt
and
sweat
of
the
newspaper
world
seems
very
hard
and
it
very
hard
with
the
dog
for
a
walk
around
windy
ash
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
a
low
sun
giving
out
a
pale
light
but
no
warmth
a
luminant
not
a
fire
the
hedgerows
bare
and
well
trimmed
an
elm
lopped
close
showing
white
stumps
which
glistened
liquidly
in
the
sun
a
curlew
whistling
overhead
a
deeply
cut
lane
washed
hard
and
clean
by
the
winter
rains
a
gunshot
from
a
distant
cover
a
creeping
wren
silent
and
tame
in
a
bramble
bush
and
over
the
gate
the
granite
roller
with
vacant
shafts
i
leaned
on
the
gate
and
saw
the
great
whisps
of
cloud
in
the
sky
like
comets
tails
everything
cold
crystalline
he
had
spoken
about
me
to
the
museum
authorities
and
it
was
his
influence
which
got
me
the
nomination
to
sit
for
the
examination
in
byron
poem
as
a
young
man
a
young
man
my
purpose
was
to
plough
up
all
obstacles
brook
no
delays
and
without
let
or
hindrance
win
through
to
an
almost
immediate
success
but
witness
my
career
so
far
has
been
like
the
white
knight
who
fell
off
behind
when
the
horse
started
in
front
when
it
stopped
and
sideways
occasionally
to
vary
the
monotony
feeling
ill
and
suffering
from
attacks
of
faintness
my
ill
health
has
produced
a
change
in
my
attitude
towards
work
as
soon
as
i
begin
to
feel
the
least
bit
down
i
am
bound
to
stop
at
once
as
the
idea
of
bending
over
a
desk
or
a
dissecting
dish
of
reading
or
studying
nauseates
me
when
i
think
that
perhaps
or
next
day
or
next
week
next
month
next
year
i
may
be
dead
what
a
waste
of
life
it
seems
to
work
zoology
is
repugnant
and
philosophy
superfluous
beside
the
bliss
of
sheer
living
out
in
the
cold
polar
air
or
indoors
in
a
chair
before
a
roaring
fire
with
hands
clasped
watching
the
bustling
soothing
activity
of
the
flames
then
as
soon
as
i
am
well
again
i
forget
all
this
grow
discontented
with
doing
nothing
and
work
like
a
tiger
walked
in
the
country
coming
home
terrified
by
a
really
violent
attack
of
palpitation
almost
every
one
i
met
i
thought
would
be
the
unfortunate
person
who
would
have
to
pick
me
up
as
each
one
in
the
street
approached
me
i
weighed
him
in
the
balance
and
considered
if
he
had
presence
of
mind
and
how
he
would
render
first
aid
after
my
friend
had
passed
i
felt
sorry
that
the
tragedy
had
not
already
happened
for
he
knows
me
and
where
i
live
at
length
after
sundry
leanings
over
the
river
wall
arrived
at
the
library
which
i
entered
and
sat
down
when
the
full
force
of
the
palpitation
was
immediately
felt
my
face
burned
with
the
hot
blood
my
hand
holding
the
paper
shook
with
the
angry
pulse
and
my
heart
went
bang
bang
bang
and
i
could
feel
its
beat
in
the
carotids
of
the
neck
and
up
along
the
torcular
herophili
and
big
vessels
in
the
occipital
region
of
the
head
drew
in
each
breath
very
gently
for
fear
of
aggravating
the
fiend
got
home
do
know
how
and
had
some
sal
volatile
am
better
now
but
very
demoralised
feel
like
a
piece
of
drawn
threadwork
or
an
undeveloped
negative
or
a
jelly
fish
on
stilts
or
a
sloppy
tadpole
or
a
weevil
in
a
nut
or
a
spitchcocked
eel
in
other
words
and
in
short
after
some
days
with
the
vision
of
sudden
death
constantly
before
me
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
a
long
way
to
go
to
die
am
coming
back
anyhow
yet
these
are
a
few
terrible
pages
in
my
history
the
doctor
orders
cease
work
have
brought
on
in
an
aggravated
form
my
infatuation
for
zoological
research
i
lie
in
bed
and
manufacture
rolling
periods
in
praise
of
it
i
get
dithyrambic
over
the
zoologists
themselves
huxley
wallace
brooks
lankester
i
chortle
to
reflect
that
in
zoology
there
are
no
stock
exchange
ambitions
there
is
no
mention
of
slum
life
tariff
reform
is
not
included
in
the
repose
of
the
spacious
laboratory
by
the
seaside
or
in
the
halls
of
some
great
museum
life
with
its
vulgar
struggles
its
hustle
and
obscenity
scarcely
penetrates
behind
those
doors
life
flows
slowly
deeply
i
am
ascetic
and
long
for
the
monastic
seclusion
of
a
student
life
one
maiden
lady

my
dear
sister

been
expecting

had
inflammation

eyes

thought

doctor

he
says

the
eyes
and
windpipe
i
am

wilkins
the
butcher

about
his
brother
the
other
day
he
says
as
brothers
they
love
each
other
very
much
we
have
very
sad
cases
of
men
ill
in
the
village
we
had
but
one
man
died
of
cancer
yr
loving
sister
amy
voilà
if
i
die
i
should
like
to
be
buried
in
the
cherry
orchards
at
v
how
the
beastly
mob
loves
a
tragedy
the
sudden
death
of
the
bank
manager
is
simply
thrilling
the
town
and
the
newspapers
sell
like
hot
cakes
scarcely
before
the
body
is
cold
the
coincidence
of
his
death
on
the
anniversary
of
his
birth
is
discussed
in
every
household
every
one
tells
everybody
else
where
they
saw
him
last
he
looked
all
right
then
the
policeman
and
the
housemaid
the
mayor
and
the
town
clerk
the
cabman
and
the
billposter
stand
and
discuss
the
deceased
last
words
or
what
the
widow
left
with
ah
well
it
is
very
sad
they
remark
to
one
another
with
no
emotion
and
continue
on
their
way
on
coming
downstairs
in
the
evening
played
ludo
with
h
at
one
stage
i
laughed
so
much
in
conjunction
with
that
harlequin
h
that
i
got
cramp
in
the
abdominal
muscles
and
the
tears
trickled
down
my
face
h
and
i
play
ludo
incessantly
we
developed
the
gambling
fever
and
our
excitement
every
now
and
then
explodes
in
fiendish
cackles
and
mother
looks
up
over
her
spectacles
and
says
william
william
they
hear
in
the
street
presently
for
this
world
unfortunates
his
is
the
ripe
sympathy
of
a
nature
standing
in
strong
contrast
with
the
rest
of
his
personality
which
is
wholly
a
little
ungenerous
and
what
strong
men
of
impeccable
character
call
weak
if
you
are
ill
he
is
delightful
if
you
are
robust
or
successful
he
can
be
very
objectionable
to
an
influenza
victim
he
goes
out
of
his
way
to
carry
a
book
but
if
you
tell
him
with
gusto
you
have
passed
your
exam
he
says
oh
but
there
not
much
behind
it
is
there
oh
no
i
answer
comforting
him
it
is
really
a
misfortune
to
be
a
success
and
so
only
the
bankrupts
dipsos
as
he
calls
them
and
sudden
deaths
ever
touch
his
heart
or
tap
his
sympathy
he
is
a
short
queery
dressy
little
fellow
always
spruce
and
clean
his
joy
consists
in
a
glass
of
beer
a
full
stomach
a
good
cigar
or
a
pretty
girl
to
flirt
with
he
frequents
drinking
saloons
and
billiard
rooms
goes
to
dances
and
likes
to
be
thought
a
lady
man
urn
he
will
say
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
a
little
too
broad
in
the
beam
as
some
attractive
damsel
walks
down
the
street
any
day
about
twelve
you
can
see
both
of
us
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
he
is
only
half
my
height
and
i
call
him
walking
together
in
the
park
and
engaged
in
the
most
heated
discussion
over
some
entirely
trivial
matter
such
as
whether
he
would
marry
a
woman
with
sore
eyes
etc
more
than
once
we
have
caught
cabmen
idle
on
the
or
policemen
on
point
duty
jerking
their
thumbs
backward
at
us
and
expressing
some
facetious
remarks
which
we
longed
to
overhear
i
usually
walk
in
the
gutter
to
bring
my
height
down
a
bit
a
good
raconteur
himself
he
does
not
willingly
suffer
a
story
from
another
the
varmint
on
occasion
finishes
your
joke
off
for
you
which
is
his
delicate
way
of
intimating
that
he
has
heard
it
before
he
is
a
mimic
and
sends
every
one
into
a
thousand
fits
while
he
gives
you
in
succession
the
mayor
and
all
the
corporation
he
also
delights
me
at
times
by
mimicking
me
his
mind
is
receptive
rather
than
creative
it
picks
up
all
sorts
of
gaudy
ideas
by
the
wayside
like
a
magpie
and
i
sometimes
enjoy
the
exquisite
sensation
of
hearing
some
of
these
petty
pilferings
which
he
has
filched
from
me
laid
at
my
feet
as
if
they
were
his
own
the
ideas
which
are
his
own
are
always
unmistakable
his
favourite
poems
are
omar
and
the
ballad
of
reading
jail
his
favourite
drinks
medoc
or
a
cherry
mixture
me
he
describes
as
with
arms
pinheaded
and
so
on
he
amuses
me
in
fact
i
love
him
no
one
will
ever
understand
without
personal
experience
that
an
exceedingly
creature
like
myself
driven
in
on
himself
to
consume
himself
is
the
unhappiest
of
men
i
have
come
to
loathe
myself
my
finicking
hypersensitive
morbid
nature
always
thinking
talking
writing
about
myself
for
all
the
world
as
if
the
world
beyond
did
not
exist
i
am
rings
within
rings
circles
concentric
and
intersecting
a
maze
a
tangle
watching
myself
behave
or
misbehave
always
reflecting
on
what
impression
i
am
making
on
others
or
what
they
think
of
me
introduce
me
to
a
stranger
and
i
swell
out
as
big
as
alice
makes
me
pneumatic
and
consequently
so
awkward
and
clumsy
and
swollen
that
i
do
know
how
to
converse
and
god
help
the
other
fellow
youth
is
an
intoxication
without
wine
some
one
says
life
is
an
intoxication
the
only
sober
man
is
the
melancholiac
who
disenchanted
looks
at
life
sees
it
as
it
really
is
and
cuts
his
throat
if
this
be
so
i
want
to
be
very
drunk
the
great
thing
is
to
live
to
clutch
at
our
existence
and
race
away
with
it
in
some
great
and
enthralling
pursuit
above
all
i
must
beware
of
all
ultimate
questions
they
are
too
maddeningly
unanswerable
let
me
eschew
philosophy
and
burn
omar
in
this
week
a
youth
advertises
young
thinkers
interested
in
philosophy
religion
social
reform
the
future
of
humanity
and
all
freethought
please
communicate
with
aged
all
right
for
i
have
in
mind
some
work
on
the
vascular
system
of
larval
newts
in
the
autumn
i
see
a
large
piece
of
work
to
be
done
in
animal
psychology
namely
frequency
of
stimulus
and
its
relation
to
habit
formation
yet
the
doctor
advises
long
rest
and
the
office
work
remains
to
be
done
i
must
hack
my
way
through
somehow
i
sit
trying
to
disentangle
these
knots
then
some
one
plays
a
dreamy
waltz
and
all
my
fine
edifices
of
the
will
vanish
in
mist
is
it
worth
while
why
not
float
with
the
tide
but
i
soon
throw
off
these
temptations
if
i
live
i
shall
play
a
fine
game
i
am
determined
a
life
is
of
no
use
a
journey
in
a
railway
train
makes
me
sentimental
if
i
enter
the
compartment
a
cheerful
youth
fresh
and
whistling
from
a
walk
by
the
sea
yet
as
soon
as
i
am
settled
down
in
one
corner
and
the
train
is
rattling
along
past
fields
woods
towns
and
painted
stations
i
find
myself
indulging
in
a
saccharine
sadness
very
toothsome
and
jolly
i
pull
a
long
face
and
gaze
out
of
the
window
wistfully
and
look
sad
but
i
am
really
happy
and
incredibly
sentimental
the
effect
is
produced
i
suppose
by
the
quickly
changing
panoramic
view
of
the
country
and
as
i
see
everything
sliding
swiftly
by
and
feel
myself
being
hurtled
forward
i
am
of
the
flight
of
time
of
the
eternal
flux
of
the
trajectory
of
my
own
life
timid
folk
of
course
want
some
rock
of
ages
something
static
they
want
life
a
mill
pond
rather
than
the
torrent
which
it
is
a
homely
affair
of
teacups
and
tabby
cats
rather
than
a
dangerous
expedition
who
will
rid
me
of
the
body
of
this
death
my
body
is
chained
to
me
a
dead
weight
it
is
my
warder
i
can
do
nothing
without
first
consulting
it
and
seeking
its
permission
i
jeer
at
its
grotesqueness
i
chafe
at
the
thongs
it
binds
on
me
on
this
bully
i
am
dependent
for
everything
the
world
can
give
me
how
can
i
preserve
my
when
i
must
needs
be
for
ever
wheedling
and
cajoling
a
despot
with
delicate
meats
and
soft
couches
i
who
am
proud
ambitious
and
full
of
energy
in
the
end
too
i
know
it
intends
to
carry
me
off
i
should
like
though
to
have
the
last
kick
and
copying
de
quincey
arrange
to
hand
it
over
for
dissection
to
the
medical
men
out
of
revenge
hope
thou
not
much
fear
thou
not
at
all
my
motto
of
late
i
can
well
imagine
looking
back
on
these
entries
later
on
and
blushing
at
the
pettiness
of
my
soul
herein
revealed
only
be
charitable
kind
reader
there
are
three
johns
and
i
am
much
mistaken
if
in
these
pages
there
will
not
be
found
something
of
the
john
known
to
himself
and
an
inkling
perhaps
of
the
man
as
he
is
known
to
his
creator
as
a
timid
showman
afraid
that
unless
he
emphasises
the
feature
of
his
exhibit
they
will
be
overlooked
let
me
hat
in
hand
point
out
that
i
know
i
am
an
ass
that
i
am
still
hoping
in
spite
of
ill
health
that
i
am
an
enthusiast
maeterlinck
and
is
distilled
marcus
aurelius
i
am
rather
tired
of
these
comfortable
philosophers
if
a
man
be
harassed
by
fate
with
a
red
rag
and
a
picador
let
him
turn
and
rend
him
or
try
to
anyway
by
the
i
have
been
living
out
of
doors
a
lot
lately
and
am
getting
sunburnt
it
gives
me
infinite
pleasure
to
be
sunburnt
to
appear
the
man
of
the
open
air
the
open
road
and
the
wild
life
the
sun
intoxicates
me
the
sea
is
not
big
enough
to
hold
me
nor
the
sky
for
me
to
breathe
in
i
feel
i
should
like
to
be
swaying
with
all
the
passions
throbbing
with
life
and
a
vast
activity
of
heart
and
sinew
to
live
magnificently
with
an
unquenchable
thirst
to
drink
to
the
lees
to
plumb
the
depth
of
every
joy
and
every
sorrow
to
see
my
life
flash
in
the
heat
ah
youth
youth
youth
in
these
moments
of
ecstasy
my
happiness
is
torrential
i
have
the
soul
of
the
poppy
flaming
in
me
then
i
am
rather
like
the
poppy
in
many
ways
it
is
peculiarly
appropriate
it
must
be
my
flower
i
am
the
poppy
l
was
digging
up
the
ground
in
his
garden
and
one
shovelful
came
up
thick
and
shapely
he
laid
the
sod
on
its
back
gently
without
breaking
it
and
said
simply
does
it
come
up
nice
his
face
was
radiant
real
happiness
lies
in
the
little
things
in
a
bit
of
garden
work
in
the
rattle
of
the
teacups
in
the
next
room
in
the
last
chapter
of
a
book
returned
home
i
hate
living
in
this
little
town
if
some
one
dies
he
is
sure
to
be
some
one
you
had
a
joke
with
the
night
before
a
suicide
ten
to
one
implicates
your
bosom
friend
or
else
the
little
man
at
the
bookshop
cut
him
down
there
have
been
three
deaths
since
i
came
home
i
knew
them
all
it
depresses
me
the
town
seems
a
mortuary
with
all
these
dead
bodies
lying
in
it
lucky
for
you
if
you
a
fat
rubicund
unimaginative
physician
two
more
people
dead
one
a
school
friend
sat
on
a
seat
on
the
river
bank
and
read
the
of
animal
it
made
me
long
to
be
at
work
i
foamed
at
the
mouth
to
be
sitting
there
perforce
in
an
overcoat
on
a
seat
doing
nothing
like
a
pet
dove
a
weak
heart
makes
crossing
a
road
an
adventure
and
turns
each
day
into
a
dangerous
expedition
a
dirty
ragamuffin
on
the
river
bank
held
up
a
tin
can
to
me
with
the
softly
persuasive
words
mister
bait
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
fish
what
for
salmon
we
have
all
tried
to
catch
salmon
with
a
bent
pin
no
matter
though
if
no
salmon
be
caught
richard
jefferies
said
if
there
be
no
immortality
still
we
shall
have
had
the
glory
of
that
thought
spent
some
happy
time
reading
over
old
diaries
i
was
grieved
and
surprised
to
find
how
much
i
had
forgotten
to
forget
the
past
so
easily
seems
scarcely
loyal
to
oneself
i
am
so
selfishly
absorbed
in
my
present
self
that
i
have
grown
not
to
care
a
damn
about
that
ever
increasing
collection
of
past
selves
those
dear
dead
gentlemen
who
one
after
the
other
have
tenanted
the
temple
of
this
flesh
and
handed
on
the
torch
of
my
life
and
personal
identity
before
creeping
away
silently
and
modestly
to
rest
brilliantly
fine
and
warm
unable
to
resist
the
sun
so
i
caught
the
ten
train
to
s
and
walked
across
the
meadow
buttercups
ragged
robins
to
the
dipper
stream
and
the
ivy
bridge
read
ardently
in
geology
till
twelve
then
took
off
my
boots
and
socks
and
waded
underneath
the
right
arch
of
the
bridge
in
deep
water
and
eventually
sat
on
a
dry
stone
at
the
top
of
the
masonry
just
where
the
water
drops
into
the
green
salmon
pool
in
a
solid
bar
next
i
waded
upstream
to
a
big
slab
of
rock
tilted
at
a
comfortable
angle
i
lay
flat
on
this
with
my
nether
extremities
in
water
up
to
my
knees
the
sun
bathed
my
face
and
dragon
flies
chased
up
and
down
intent
on
murder
but
i
cared
not
a
tinker
demetrius
about
nature
red
in
tooth
and
claw
i
was
quite
satisfied
with
nature
under
a
june
sun
in
the
cool
atmosphere
of
a
dipper
stream
i
lay
on
the
slab
completely
relaxed
and
the
cool
water
ran
strongly
between
my
toes
surely
i
was
never
again
going
to
be
miserable
the
voices
of
children
playing
in
the
wood
made
me
extra
happy
as
a
rule
i
loathe
children
i
am
too
much
of
a
youth
still
but
not
this
morning
for
these
were
fairy
voices
ringing
through
enchanted
woods
brilliantly
fine
and
warm
went
by
train
to
c
woods
took
return
on
account
of
the
heat
crossed
the
meadow
and
up
the
hill
to
the
mill
leat
where
we
bathed
our
feet
and
read
ate
a
powerful
lunch
and
made
several
unsuccessful
grabs
at
caddie
flies
i
want
one
to
examine
the
mouth
parts
after
lunch
we
sat
on
the
over
the
stream
and
i
rested
on
it
flat
in
the
face
of
the
sun
the
sun
seemed
to
burn
into
my
very
bones
purging
away
everything
that
may
be
dark
or
threatening
there
the
physical
sensation
of
the
blood
flow
beneath
the
skin
was
good
to
feel
and
the
heat
made
every
tissue
glow
with
a
radiant
when
i
got
up
and
opened
my
eyes
all
the
colours
of
the
landscape
vanished
under
the
silvery
whiteness
of
the
intense
sunlight
we
put
on
our
boots
and
socks
our
feet
seemed
to
have
swollen
to
a
very
large
size
and
wandered
downstream
to
a
little
white
house
a
gamekeeper
cottage
where
the
old
woman
gave
us
cream
and
milk
and
bread
in
her
beautiful
old
kitchen
with
open
hearth
china
dogs
of
course
and
on
the
wall
an
old
painting
representing
the
person
of
a
page
boy
so
she
said
who
was
once
employed
up
at
the
squire
an
unwholesome
atmosphere
of
pigs
pervaded
the
garden
but
as
this
is
not
pretty
i
ought
to
leave
it
out
brilliantly
fine
went
by
the
early
train
to
s
walked
to
the
ivy
bridge
and
then
waded
upstream
to
the
great
slab
of
rock
where
i
spread
myself
in
the
sun
as
before
the
experiment
was
so
delightful
it
is
worth
repeating
a
hundred
times
in
this
position
i
read
of
the
decline
and
fall
of
trilobites
of
the
stratigraphy
of
the
lias
and
so
on
geology
is
a
very
crushing
science
yet
i
enjoyed
my
existence
this
morning
with
the
other
flies
about
that
stream
sat
at
liverpool
university
for
the
practical
exam
zoology
board
of
education
at
the
close
the
other
students
left
but
i
went
on
working
herdman
asked
me
if
i
had
finished
i
said
no
so
he
gave
me
a
little
more
time
later
he
came
up
again
and
again
i
said
no
but
he
replied
that
he
was
afraid
i
must
stop
what
could
you
do
further
he
asked
picking
up
a
dish
of
plankton
i
pointed
out
a
an
and
a
and
he
replied
of
course
i
put
in
more
than
you
were
expected
to
identify
in
the
time
so
as
to
make
a
choice
possible
then
he
complimented
me
on
my
written
papers
which
were
sent
in
some
weeks
ago
and
looking
at
my
practical
work
he
added
and
this
too
seems
to
be
quite
excellent
i
thanked
him
from
the
bottom
of
a
greedy
and
grateful
heart
and
he
went
on
i
see
you
describe
yourself
in
your
papers
as
a
journalist
but
can
you
tell
me
exactly
what
has
been
your
career
in
zoology
i
answered
of
course
rather
proudly
that
i
had
had
career
in
zoology
but
what
school
or
college
have
you
worked
at
he
persisted
none
i
said
a
little
doggedly
what
i
know
i
have
taught
myself
so
you
had
no
training
in
zoology
at
all
no
sir
well
if
you
taught
yourself
all
you
know
you
done
remarkably
well
he
still
seemed
a
little
incredulous
and
when
i
explained
how
i
got
a
great
many
of
my
marine
animals
for
dissection
and
study
at
the
plymouth
marine
laboratory
he
immediately
asked
me
suspiciously
if
i
had
ever
worked
there
we
shook
hands
and
he
wished
me
all
success
in
the
future
to
which
i
to
myself
devoutly
said
amen
came
home
very
elated
at
having
impressed
some
one
at
last
now
for
dublin
oeconomic
biology
may
be
very
useful
but
i
am
not
interested
in
it
give
me
the
pure
science
i
do
want
to
be
worrying
my
head
over
remedies
for
potato
disease
nor
cures
for
fleas
in
fowls
heaven
preserve
me
from
ever
becoming
a
county
council
lecturer
or
a
government
entomologist
give
me
the
recluse
life
of
a
scholar
or
investigator
full
of
leisure
culture
and
delicate
skill
i
would
rather
know
bergson
than
be
able
to
stay
at
the
ritz
hotel
i
would
rather
be
able
to
dissect
a
system
than
know
the
price
of
consols
i
should
make
a
most
industrious
country
gentleman
with
a
year
and
a
deer
park
my
idea
is
to
withdraw
from
the
and
spend
laborious
days
in
the
library
or
laboratory
the
world
is
too
much
with
us
i
long
for
the
monotony
of
monastic
life
father
wasmann
and
the
abbé
spallanzani
are
the
type
let
me
set
my
face
towards
them
such
lives
afford
poor
material
for
novelists
or
dramatists
but
so
much
the
better
hamlet
makes
fine
reading
but
i
do
want
to
be
hamlet
myself
in
the
afternoon
went
out
dredging
in
fifteen
fathoms
off
the
pier
at
i
but
without
much
success
got
a
large
number
of
interesting
things
however
in
the
tow
net
including
some
advanced
eggs
of
and
a
went
to
the
trout
stream
again
after
stretching
a
muslin
net
crosswise
on
the
water
for
insects
floating
down
sat
on
the
footbridge
and
read
geology
for
the
dublin
examination
later
waded
downstream
to
a
hazel
bush
on
the
right
bank
beneath
a
shady
oak
squatted
right
down
on
the
bush
which
supported
me
like
an
and
with
legs
dangling
in
the
cool
water
opened
a
meredith
and
enjoyed
myself
had
to
write
backing
out
of
the
dublin
examination
for
which
i
am
nominated
to
sit
i
am
simply
not
fit
for
the
racket
of
such
a
journey
in
my
present
state
of
health
my
chances
of
success
too
are
not
such
as
to
warrant
my
drawing
on
dad
for
the
money
he
is
still
ill
and
secretly
agitated
i
fear
because
i
am
so
bent
on
giving
up
his
work
it
looks
however
as
if
newspaper
journalism
is
to
be
my
fate
it
was
the
refinement
of
torture
having
to
write
had
a
letter
from
s
enough
to
wring
tears
from
a
monument
sat
like
a
valetudinarian
in
the
park
all
day
getting
fresh
air
among
the
imbeciles
invalids
and
children
who
cares
but
gentlemen
you
hear
still
another
chance
quite
unexpectedly
received
a
second
nomination
this
morning
to
sit
for
another
exam
for
two
vacancies
in
the
british
museum
good
luck
this
very
hot
so
went
to
s
and
bathed
in
the
salmon
pool
stretched
myself
out
in
the
water
delighted
to
find
that
i
had
at
last
got
to
the
very
heart
of
the
countryside
i
was
not
just
watching
from
the
outside
on
the
bank
i
was
in
it
and
plunging
in
it
too
up
to
my
armpits
what
did
i
care
about
the
british
museum
or
zoology
then
all
but
the
last
enemy
and
object
of
conquest
i
had
overcome
for
the
moment
perhaps
even
death
himself
was
under
heel
i
was
immortal
in
that
minute
i
was
always
prostrate
in
the
stream
sunk
deep
in
the
bosom
of
old
mother
earth
who
can
not
die
at
to
the
salmon
pool
for
a
bathe
in
the
shade
the
meadow
was
delicious
in
the
sunshine
it
made
me
want
to
hop
flirt
my
tail
sing
i
felt
ever
such
a
wily
bird
caught
the
afternoon
train
to
c
but
unfortunately
forgot
to
take
with
me
either
watch
or
tubes
for
insects
so
i
applied
to
the
a
youth
of
about
eighteen
who
is
also
signalman
porter
and
indeed
very
factotal
even
to
the
extent
of
providing
me
with
empty
match
boxes
i
agreed
with
him
to
be
called
by
three
halloos
from
the
viaduct
just
before
the
evening
train
came
in
then
i
went
up
to
the
leat
set
up
my
muslin
net
in
it
for
insects
floating
down
and
then
went
across
to
the
stream
and
bathed
afterwards
went
back
and
boxed
the
insects
caught
and
returned
to
the
little
station
with
its
creepers
on
the
walls
and
over
the
roof
all
as
delightfully
quiet
as
ever
and
the
station
youth
as
delightfully
silly
then
the
little
train
came
around
the
bend
of
the
line
green
puffing
engine
and
red
coaches
like
a
crawling
caterpillar
of
gay
colour
a
trapper
killed
a
specimen
of
and
brought
it
to
me
i
gave
him
sixpence
for
it
and
am
just
going
to
dissect
it
there
are
folk
who
notice
nothing
witness
capt
mcwhirr
in
they
live
side
by
side
with
genius
or
tragedy
as
innocent
as
babies
there
are
heaps
of
people
who
live
on
a
mountain
a
volcano
even
without
knowing
it
if
the
stars
of
heaven
fell
and
the
moon
were
turned
into
blood
some
one
would
have
to
direct
their
attention
to
it
perhaps
after
all
the
most
obvious
things
are
the
most
difficult
to
see
we
all
recognise
keats
now
but
suppose
he
was
only
the
boy
next
door
why
should
i
read
his
verses
a
snake
prepared
the
skull
of
grass
snake
i
fancy
i
scooped
out
the
eyes
with
patent
delight
i
suppose
symbolically
as
though
on
behalf
of
the
rest
of
suffering
humanity
i
were
wiping
off
the
old
score
against
the
beast
for
its
behaviour
in
the
garden
of
eden
at
dad
had
three
separate
strokes
of
paralysis
in
as
many
minutes
the
third
leaving
him
helpless
they
sent
for
me
in
the
library
where
i
was
reading
and
i
hurried
home
just
as
i
entered
the
bedroom
where
he
and
mother
were
another
attack
came
on
and
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
with
her
help
i
managed
to
get
him
from
the
chair
to
the
bed
he
struggled
with
his
left
arm
and
leg
and
made
inarticulate
noises
which
sounded
as
if
they
might
be
groans
i
know
if
he
was
in
pain
dear
mother
dad
can
not
live
long
mother
bears
up
wonderfully
well
tried
to
do
some
examination
work
but
failed
utterly

mother
who
will
not
leave
the
nurse
says
he
will
not
live
through
the
night
telegraphed
for
a
to
come
a
came
downstairs
and
had
a
little
supper
went
to
bed
h
and
the
others
lit
a
fire
and
we
have
all
sat
around
it
silent
listening
to
its
murmur
every
one
felt
cold
dad
has
been
unconscious
for
over
an
hour
heard
a
noise
then
heard
mother
coming
downstairs
past
my
bedroom
door
with
some
one
sobbing
i
knew
it
must
be
all
over
h
was
helping
her
down
waited
in
my
bedroom
in
the
dark
for
three
parts
of
an
hour
when
h
came
up
opened
the
door
slowly
and
said
he
gone
old
man
it
was
a
tremendous
relief
to
know
that
since
he
had
to
die
his
sufferings
and
cruel
plight
were
over
fell
asleep
from
sheer
exhaustion
and
slept
soundly
the
funeral
is
not
death
but
the
dreadful
possibilities
of
life
which
are
so
day
in
a
cool
breezy
autumn
day
the
beach
was
covered
with
patches
of
soapy
foam
that
shook
tremulously
in
the
wind
all
the
rocks
and
everything
were
drenched
with
water
and
the
spray
came
off
the
breaking
waves
like
steam
a
red
sun
went
lower
and
lower
and
the
shadows
cast
by
the
rocks
grew
very
long
and
grotesque
underneath
the
breaking
waves
the
hollows
were
green
and
dark
like
sea
caverns
herring
gulls
played
about
in
the
air
balancing
themselves
as
they
faced
the
breeze
then
sweeping
suddenly
around
and
downwards
with
the
wind
behind
them
we
all
sat
down
on
the
rocks
and
were
very
quiet
almost
monosyllabic
we
pointed
out
a
passing
vessel
to
one
another
or
chucked
a
bit
of
shingle
into
the
sea
you
would
have
said
we
were
bored
yet
deep
down
in
ourselves
we
were
astir
and
all
around
us
we
could
hear
the
rumours
of
divine
passage
soft
and
mysterious
as
the
flight
of
birds
migrating
in
the
dark
the
wind
rose
and
tapped
the
line
against
the
at
the
coastguard
station
it
roared
through
my
hair
and
past
my
ears
for
an
hour
on
end
till
i
felt
quite
windswept
and
bleak
on
the
way
home
we
saw
the
wind
darting
hither
and
thither
over
the
long
grass
like
a
lunatic
snake
the
wind
oh
the
wind
i
have
an
enormous
faith
in
the
curative
properties
of
the
wind
i
feel
better
already
staying
in
surrey
exam
over
and
i
feel
fairly
confident
after
an
agony
for
a
few
days
before
on
account
of
the
development
of
a
cold
which
threatened
to
snatch
the
last
chance
out
of
my
hands
sitting
on
a
gate
on
the
downs
i
saw
a
long
way
below
me
in
the
valley
a
man
standing
in
a
chalk
pit
and
wielding
a
stick
vigorously
for
some
reason
or
another
the
idea
came
to
me
that
it
would
be
interesting
if
he
were
in
the
act
of
killing
a
snake
he
so
far
away
below
and
i
above
and
unnoticed
quietly
watching
him
at
dinner
this
revised
version
of
the
story
came
out
quite
pat
and
natural
and
obviously
interested
the
assembly
i
added
graphically
that
the
man
was
too
far
away
from
me
to
be
able
to
say
what
of
snake
it
was
he
was
killing
i
possess
the
qualifications
of
an
artistic
liar
yet
i
ca
regard
such
a
story
as
a
lie
it
was
rather
a
justifiable
emendation
of
an
otherwise
uninteresting
incident
she
is
a
tiny
little
old
lady
very
frail
and
very
delicate
with
a
tiny
voice
like
the
noise
of
a
fretsaw
she
talks
incessantly
about
things
which
do
not
interest
you
until
your
face
gets
stiff
with
forcing
a
polite
smile
and
your
voice
cracked
and
your
throat
dry
with
saying
yes
and
really
i
attend
the
zoological
society
to
read
my
first
paper
so
i
am
really
in
a
fluster
and
want
to
be
quiet
therefore
to
prevent
her
from
talking
i
write
two
letters
which
i
represent
as
urgent
at
desperate
so
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
dark
london
streets
returned
to
supper
and
to
her
after
the
wife
the
husband
is
intellectual
pyrotechnics
referring
to
the
museum
would
you
have
there
i
suppose
any
insects
in
a
case
like
what
you
might
say
to
study
to
yourself
when
no
one
is
by
he
inquired
it
is
now
one
hour
before
i
need
leave
for
the
meeting
and
whether
i
sigh
cough
smoke
or
read
the
paper
she
goes
on
she
even
refuses
to
allow
me
to
scan
the
lines
below
photos
in
the
london
i
write
this
as
the
last
sole
resource
to
escape
her
devastating
prattle
and
the
ceaseless
hum
of
her
tiny
mind
she
thinks
because
i
told
her
so
that
i
am
preparing
notes
for
the
evening
meeting
spent
an
absolutely
damnable
day
am
sick
tired
bored
frantic
with
her
voice
which
i
have
been
able
to
share
with
no
one
except
the
intellectual
giant
her
husband
at
tea
time
in
order
to
break
the
flow
of
chatter
i
would
rudely
interrupt
and
go
on
talking
by
this
means
keeping
my
end
up
for
as
long
as
i
could
and
enjoying
a
short
respite
from
the
voice
but
i
tired
of
this
and
it
was
of
no
permanent
value
when
i
broke
in
she
still
went
on
for
a
few
sentences
unable
to
stop
and
lo
here
was
the
spectacle
of
two
persons
alone
together
in
a
room
both
talking
at
the
same
time
and
neither
listening
i
persisted
though
and
she
had
to
stop
once
started
i
was
afraid
to
stop
scared
at
the
certain
fact
of
the
voice
beginning
to
saw
again
after
a
while
the
fountain
of
my
artificial
garrulity
dried
up
and
the
voice
at
once
leaped
into
the
breach
resuming
amazing
and
incredible
as
it
seems
at
the
precise
point
where
it
had
left
off
at
i
am
quite
exhausted
and
sit
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
staring
with
glassy
eyes
arms
drooping
at
my
sides
and
mouth
druling
at
her
cough
increases
and
she
has
to
stop
to
attend
to
it
with
a
fiendish
smile
i
push
back
my
chair
and
quietly
watch
her
cough
she
coughs
continuously
now
and
can
talk
no
longer
thank
god
left
for
the
meeting
where
i
read
my
paper
in
a
state
of
awful
nervousness
i
read
out
all
i
had
to
say
and
kept
them
amused
for
about
ten
minutes
i
was
very
excited
when
got
up
and
praised
the
paper
saying
it
was
interesting
and
hoping
i
should
continue
the
experiments
the
chairman
sir
john
rose
bradford
asked
a
question
i
answered
it
and
then
sat
down
after
the
meeting
we
went
upstairs
to
the
library
had
tea
and
chatted
with
some
of
the
big
people
zoology
is
certainly
delightful
yet
it
seems
to
me
the
zoologists
are
much
as
other
people
i
like
zoology
i
wish
i
could
do
without
zoologists
home
once
more
the
natural
history
museum
impressed
me
enormously
it
is
a
magnificent
building
too
magnificent
to
work
there
to
follow
one
profession
in
a
building
like
that
seems
an
altogether
too
grandiose
manner
of
life
a
pious
zoologist
might
go
up
to
pray
in
it
but
not
to
earn
his
daily
bread
there
i
in
in
in
being
first
with
marks
to
spare
old
m
the
servant
rushes
up
to
my
sister
bedroom
with
the
news
just
after
and
she
says
fine
fine
and
comes
down
in
her
nightgown
to
my
bedroom
where
we
drink
our
morning
cup
of
tea
together
and
talk
i
delighted
what
a
magnificent
obstacle
race
it
has
been
still
one
ditch
the
medical
exam
wired
to
friends
this
is
the
sort
of
letter
which
is
balm
to
me
my
darling
w
i
need
hardly
tell
you
how
absolutely
delighted
we
were
at
the
grand
news
of
this
morning
you
must
be
feeling
a
huge
glow
of
satisfaction
with
the
knowledge
of
your
object
attained
through
untold
difficulties
i
do
wish
to
butter
you
up
or
to
gush
but
i
must
honestly
say
that
i
feel
proud
of
my
old
beano
i
admire
your
brains
more
than
ever
and
also
your
indomitable
pluck
and
grit
and
your
quiet
bravery
in
disappointment
and
difficulty
the
three
most
fascinating
books
in
science
that
i
have
so
far
read
are
easily
darwin
of
the
of
bergson
went
to
the
dentist
in
the
afternoon
evening
chiefly
occupied
in
reading
by
my
halidom
it
is
an
extraordinarily
interesting
book
i
am
always
looking
out
for
new
friends
assaying
for
friendship
there
is
no
more
delightful
adventure
than
an
expedition
into
a
rich
personality
gradually
over
a
long
probation
for
deep
minds
are
naturally
reticent
piece
after
piece
is
added
to
the
geography
of
your
friend
mind
and
each
piece
pleases
or
entertains
while
in
return
you
let
him
steal
away
piece
after
piece
of
your
own
territory
perhaps
saving
a
bit
up
here
and
there
such
as
an
enthusiasm
for
francis
thompson
poetry
and
then
letting
it
go
unexpectedly
it
a
delightful
reciprocity
i
dream
of
the
honeyed
ease
of
the
civil
servant
working
day
peacock
yet
the
french
say
sont
in
the
park
it
was
very
dark
and
she
said
if
i
lose
you
i
sha
be
able
to
find
my
way
home
oh
i
look
after
you
i
said
both
being
of
the
same
mind
at
the
same
time
we
sat
down
on
a
seat
together
when
a
fortunate
thing
happened
it
began
to
rain
so
i
offered
her
part
of
my
overcoat
she
nestled
in
under
my
arm
and
i
kissed
her
out
of
hand
a
very
pretty
little
girl
my
word
the
thing
is
obsessing
me
after
an
early
supper
called
and
found
my
lady
ready
to
receive
me
no
one
else
at
home
so
walked
into
the
room
with
the
windows
took
off
my
coat
and
scarf
she
followed
and
switched
off
the
light
there
was
a
roaring
fire
in
the
grate
she
is
very
amorous
and
i
am
not
hippolytus
so
we
were
soon
closely
engaged
in
the
large
chair
before
the
fire
as
we
sailed
thus
close
hauled
to
the
wind
with
double
entendres
and
she
trembled
in
the
storm
and
i
was
at
the
helm
the
garden
gate
slammed
and
both
of
us
got
up
quickly
i
next
heard
a
key
turn
in
the
lock
and
a
foot
in
the
passage
she
said
she
switched
on
the
light
went
out
swiftly
into
the
passage
and
meeting
him
conducted
him
to
her
office
while
i
as
swiftly
put
on
overcoat
and
scarf
and
slipped
out
through
the
open
door
stumbling
over
his
bicycle
but
of
course
not
stopping
to
pick
it
up
later
she
telephoned
to
say
it
was
all
right
very
relieved
she
recalls
richepin
she
is
a
fine
sedative
her
movements
are
a
pleasant
adagio
her
voice
piano
to
pianissimo
her
conversation
breaks
off
in
thrilling
aposiopoeses
an
awful
comedy
this
morning
for
as
soon
as
i
was
securely
gagged
the
dentist
went
out
of
the
room
she
approached
leered
at
me
helpless
and
said
provokingly
oh
you
do
look
funny
minx
on
returning
he
said
to
her
would
you
like
to
hold
his
hand
she
oh
not
just
now
and
they
grinned
at
one
another
and
at
me
waiting
to
be
tortured
on
the
station
waited
for
an
hour
for
the
train
gave
her
a
box
of
sweets
and
the
we
walked
up
the
platform
to
extreme
end
in
the
dark
and
kissed
but
it
was
very
windy
and
cold
i
noticed
that
so
we
entered
an
empty
luggage
guard
van
on
rail
beside
platform
left
there
by
shunters
here
we
were
out
of
the
wind
and
far
better
off
but
a
shunter
came
along
and
turned
us
out
she
gave
me
a
silver
but
i
believe
for
various
reasons
that
it
is
one
of
her
own
and
not
a
new
one
said
at
r
played
the
negligent
reclining
on
the
chesterfield
leaning
against
the
grand
piano
or
measuring
my
length
on
the
mat
before
the
fire
i
begin
duties
at
the
british
museum
of
natural
history
i
can
not
quite
imagine
myself
a
museum
assistant
before
i
get
there
i
know
i
shall
be
the
strangest
assistant
on
the
staff
it
will
be
singing
my
song
in
a
strange
land
and
weeping
i
hope
not
too
bitterly
down
by
the
waters
of
a
very
queer
babylon
still
i
have
burnt
my
bridges
like
cæsar
or
burnt
my
ships
like
cortez
so
forward
see

for

the
paper
was

in
batrachia
detailing
experiments
on
the
homing
faculty
in
newts
part
ii
in
london
am
at
last
beginning
to
get
more
content
with
the
work
at
the
museum
so
that
i
muse
on
bernard
shaw
saying
get
what
you
like
or
you
grow
to
like
what
you
get
i
have
a
terrible
suspicion
that
the
security
of
tenure
here
is
like
the
lion
den
in
the
fable
vestiga
of
course
i
am
wonderfully
proud
of
being
at
the
museum
although
i
am
disappointed
and
write
as
if
i
were
quite
blasé
i
should
be
disappointed
if
at
the
end
of
my
career
if
i
live
to
see
it
through
i
do
not
win
the
i
should
very
much
like
it
my
nature
is
very
mixed
ambitious
above
all
things
and
yet
soon
giddy
with
the
audacity
of
my
aspirations
the
and
my
colleagues
make
me
feel
most
inferior
in
fact
but
in
theory
in
the
secrecy
of
my
own
bedchamber
i
feel
that
there
are
few
men
there
my
equal

with
influenza

to
recuperate
a

to
sit
down

shave
and
brush

appalling
the
doctor
in
kensington
seemed
to
think
me
an
awful
wreck
and
asked
if
i
were
concealing
reading
baudelaire
and
verlaine
sat
on
a
seat
overlooking
the
with
stick
between
my
legs
like
an
old
man
and
watched
a
buxom
wench
aet
run
down
the
path
pursued
by
rough
and
two
little
girls
in
blue
later
they
emerged
from
a
striped
bathing
tent
in
the
glory
of
blue
bathing
dresses
it
made
me
feel
quite
an
old
man
to
see
the
girl
galloping
out
over
the
hard
level
sands
to
the
breakers
a
child
clinging
to
each
hand
legs
and
arms
twinkled
in
the
sun
which
shone
with
brilliance
if
life
were
as
level
as
those
sands
and
as
beautiful
as
that
trio
of
girls
young
men
with
h
in
his
garden
he
is
a
great
enthusiast
i
disapprove
entirely
of
your
taste
in
gardening
i
said
you
object
to
the
wilderness
style
i
like
it
you
like
lawns
laid
out
for
croquet
and
your
privet
hedges
pruned
into
save
the
king
or
et
mon
droit
my
dear
boy
if
you
saw
wilderness
at
you
be
so
shocked
you
cut
and
run
and
i
imagine
there
be
an
affecting
reunion
between
you
and
your
beloved
geraniums
for
my
part
i
do
like
geraniums
they
suburban
and
all
of
a
piece
with
antimacassars
and
stuffed
birds
under
glass
bells
the
colour
of
your
specimens
moreover
i
rapped
out
is
vulgar
like
the
muddied
petticoats
of
old
market
women
h
quite
unmoved
replied
slowly
well
here
are
some
like
the
beautiful
white
cambric
of
a
lady
of
fashion
you
got
no
taste
in
flowers
you
just
six
feet
of
grief
and
patience
we
roared
with
laughing
do
stop
watering
those
damned
plants
i
exclaimed
at
last
but
he
went
on
i
exclaimed
again
and
out
of
sheer
ridiculousness
in
reply
he
proceeded
to
water
the
cabbages
the
gravel
path
the
oak
tree
and
me
while
i
writhed
with
laughing
the
sat
upon
a
comfortable
jetty
of
rock
and
watched
the
waves
without
a
glimmer
of
an
idea
in
my
mind
about
anything
though
to
outward
view
i
might
have
been
a
philosopher
in
cerebral
parturition
with
thoughts
as
big
as
babies
instead
little
rustling
dead
leaves
of
thoughts
stirred
and
fluttered
in
the
brain
the
pimple
i
recollected
on
my
nose
or
the
boyishness
of
handwriting
or
swinburne
lines
if
the
wren
were
a
nightingale
why
then
something
seen
and
heard
of
men
might
be
half
as
sweet
as
when
laughs
a
child
of
seven
i
continued
in
this
pleasurable
coma
all
the
afternoon
and
went
home
refreshed
have
returned
to
london
and
the
my
first
day
at
the
sat
at
my
table
in
a
state
of
awful
apathy
at
least
temporarily
i
am
quite
disenchanted
of
zoology
i
work
god
save
the
mark
in
the
insect
room
on
the
way
home
purchased
peroxide
of
hydrogen
pyorrhœa
threatened
one
bottle
of
physic
for
my
appalling
dyspepsia
one
flask
of
brandy
for
emergencies
as
my
heart
is
intermittent
again
prussic
acid
next
must
have
been
near
pneumonia
at
r
auntie
was
nervous
and
came
in
during
the
night
to
see
how
i
was
it
caused
me
anguish
to
see
my
article
returned
from
the
and
lying
in
a
big
envelope
on
the
table
when
i
returned
home
this
evening
i
ca
do
any
work
because
of
it
and
in
desperation
rushed
off
to
the
stately
pleasure
domes
of
the
white
city
and
systematically
went
through
all
the
thrills
from
the
mountain
railway
to
the
wiggle
woggle
and
the
waves
i
am
easier
the
cut
worm
forgives
the
plough
but
how
restless
this
disappointment
has
made
me
i
have
no
plans
for
recuperation
and
can
not
settle
down
to
work
on
my
doctor
advice
went
to
see
p
a
lung
specialist
m
found
a
dull
spot
on
one
of
my
lungs
and
not
feeling
very
sure
and
without
telling
me
the
nature
of
his
suspicion
he
arranged
for
p
to
see
me
allowing
me
to
suppose
he
was
a
stomach
authority
as
my
dyspepsia
is
bad
well
it
is
consumption
but
my
lungs
and
physique
are
such
that
consumption
might
easily
supervene
as
soon
as
p
had
gone
m
appended
the
following
lugubrious
yarn
whenever
i
catch
cold
i
must
go
and
be
treated
at
once
all
my
leisure
must
be
spent
out
of
doors
i
must
take
cream
and
milk
in
prodigious
quantities
and
get
fat
at
all
costs
there
is
even
a
question
of
my
giving
up
work
a
young
but
fat
woman
sitting
in
the
sun
and
oozing
moisture
is
as
nasty
as
anything
in
baudelaire
brilliant
career
my
old
head
master
once
prophesied
for
me
a
brilliant
career
that
was
when
i
was
in
the
third
form
now
i
have
more
than
a
suspicion
that
i
am
one
of
those
who
as
he
once
pointed
out
grow
sometimes
out
of
a
brilliant
boyhood
into
very
commonplace
men
this
continuous
ill
health
is
having
a
very
obvious
effect
on
my
work
and
activities
with
what
courage
i
possess
i
have
to
face
the
fact
that
i
am
unable
to
think
or
express
myself
as
well
as
when
i
was
a
boy
in
my
teens
witness
this
journal
i
intend
to
go
on
however
i
have
decided
that
my
death
shall
be
disputed
all
the
way
oh
it
is
so
humiliating
to
die
i
writhe
to
think
of
being
overcome
by
so
unfair
an
enemy
before
i
have
demonstrated
myself
to
maiden
aunts
who
mistrust
me
to
colleagues
who
scorn
me
and
even
to
brothers
and
sisters
who
believe
in
me
as
an
egotist
i
hate
death
because
i
should
cease
to
be
i
most
folk
when
sick
unto
death
gain
a
little
consolation
over
the
notoriety
gained
by
the
fact
of
their
decease
criminals
enjoy
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
their
execution
voltaire
said
of
rousseau
that
he
would
mind
being
hanged
if
they
stick
his
name
on
the
gibbet
but
my
own
death
would
be
so
mean
and
insignificant
guy
de
maupassant
died
in
a
grand
manner
a
man
of
intellect
and
splendid
physique
who
became
insane
tusitala
death
in
the
south
seas
reads
like
a
romance
heine
after
a
life
of
sorrow
died
with
a
sparkling
witticism
on
his
lips
vespasian
with
a
jest
but
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
rake
up
any
excitement
over
my
own
immediate
decease
an
unobtrusive
passing
away
of
a
rancorous
disappointed
morbid
and
entomologist
in
a
west
kensington
boarding
house
what
a
mean
little
tragedy
it
is
hard
not
to
be
somebody
even
in
death
a
in
the
all
the
present
in
full
muster
there
was
a
german
schulz
who
sat
and
leered
at
his
inamorata
a
girl
while
she
gave
us
recitations
with
the
most
unwarranted
she
boasts
of
a
part
at
one
of
the
theatres
there
was
miss
m
listening
to
her
fiancé
capt
o
home
from
india
singing
indian
love
songs
at
her
there
was
miss
t
a
sour
old
maid
who
knitted
and
snorted
not
fully
conscious
of
this
young
blood
coursing
around
her
barclay
woods
pursued
her
usual
avocation
of
imposing
on
us
all
the
great
weight
of
her
immense
social
superiority
clucking
in
between
to
her
one
chick
a
fluffy
girl
of
or
who
was
sitting
now
in
the
draught
now
too
close
to
a
common
musician
of
the
covent
garden
opera
finally
our
hostess
a
divorcee
who
hated
all
males
even
we
were
a
pathetic
little
company
so
motley
who
had
come
together
not
from
love
or
regard
but
because
man
is
a
gregarious
animal
in
fact
we
sat
secretly
criticising
and
contemning
one
another
yet
outside
there
were
so
many
millions
of
people
unknown
and
overhead
the
multitude
of
the
stars
was
equally
comfortless
zoology
on
occasion
still
fires
my
ambition
surely
i
can
not
be
dying
yet
whatever
misfortune
befalls
me
i
do
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
meet
it
unflinchingly
i
do
not
fear
in
itself
but
i
do
fear
its
possible
effect
on
my
mind
and
character
already
i
am
slowly
altering
as
the
lord
liveth
already
for
example
my
sympathy
with
myself
is
maudlin
whenever
the
blow
shall
fall
some
sort
of
a
reaction
be
given
heine
flamed
into
song
beethoven
wrote
the
symphony
so
what
shall
i
do
when
my
time
comes
i
do
think
i
have
any
lyrics
or
symphonies
to
write
so
i
shall
just
have
to
grin
and
bear
it
like
a
dumb
animal
as
long
as
i
have
spirit
and
buoyancy
i
do
care
what
happens
for
i
know
that
or
so
long
i
can
not
be
accounted
a
failure
the
only
failure
is
one
in
which
the
victim
is
left
spiritless
dazed
dejected
with
blackness
all
around
and
within
a
knife
slowly
and
unrelentingly
cutting
the
strings
of
his
heart
my
head
whirls
with
conflicting
emotions
struggling
desperate
ideas
and
a
flood
of
impressions
of
all
sorts
of
things
that
are
never
sufficiently
sifted
and
arranged
to
be
caught
down
on
paper
i
am
brought
into
this
world
hustled
along
it
and
then
hustled
out
of
it
with
no
time
for
anything
i
want
to
be
on
a
great
hill
and
square
up
affairs
after
tea
we
all
three
walked
in
kensington
gardens
and
sat
on
a
seat
by
the
round
pond
my
umbrella
fell
to
the
ground
and
i
left
it
there
with
its
nose
poking
up
in
a
cynical
manner
as
she
remarked
it
not
cynical
i
said
only
a
little
knowing
wo
you
let
yours
fall
down
to
keep
it
company
yours
is
a
lady
umbrella
and
a
one
they
might
flirt
together
mine
does
want
to
flirt
she
answered
stiffly
c
a
tiny
little
village
by
the
sea
in
n
looking
up
from
a
rockpool
where
i
had
been
watching
gobies
i
saw
three
children
racing
across
the
sands
to
bathe
i
saw
a
man
dive
from
a
boat
and
i
saw
a
gallop
his
mare
down
to
the
beach
and
plunge
about
in
the
line
of
breakers
the
waters
thundered
the
mare
whinnied
the
children
shouted
to
one
another
and
i
turned
my
head
down
again
to
the
rockpool
with
a
great
thumping
heart
of
happiness
it
was
so
lovely
to
be
conscious
of
the
fact
that
out
there
this
beautiful
picture
was
awaiting
me
whenever
and
as
often
as
i
chose
to
lift
my
head
i
purposely
kept
my
head
down
for
the
picture
was
so
beautiful
i
did
not
want
to
hurt
it
by
breathing
on
it
and
i
kept
my
head
down
out
of
a
playful
delight
i
decided
not
to
indulge
myself
out
in
the
bay
dredging
for
echinoderms
with
carrots
brilliantly
fine
the
haul
was
a
failure
but
being
out
in
a
boat
on
a
waveless
sea
under
a
cloudless
sky
i
was
scarcely
depressed
at
this
we
cruised
along
from
one
little
bay
to
another
past
smugglers
caves
and
white
pebble
beaches
the
dredge
all
the
while
growling
along
the
sea
bottom
and
carrots
and
i
lying
listless
in
the
bows
i
was
my
mercury
was
positively
ringing
the
bell
who
then
is
carrots
he
is
a
fine
brawny
who
jumps
over
the
rocks
like
a
chamois
swims
like
a
fish
pulls
like
an
ox
snorts
like
a
grampus
a
sort
of
compound
zoological
perfection
built
eclectically
up
the
village
beavan
keeps
a
tiny
little
shop
and
runs
a
very
large
garden
she
showed
us
all
about
the
garden
and
introduced
us
to
her
husband
whom
we
discovered
in
an
apple
tree
an
old
man
aged
very
hard
of
hearing
and
with
an
impediment
in
his
speech
he
at
once
began
to
move
his
mouth
and
i
caught
odd
jingles
of
sound
that
sounded
like
nothing
at
all
at
first
but
which
gradually
resolved
themselves
on
close
attention
to
such
familiar
landmarks
as
early
boughies
stubbits
ribstone
pippins
into
a
discourse
on
apples
the
following
curious
conversation
took
place
between
me
and
the
deaf
gaffer
aged
standing
in
the
apple
tree
these
be
all
appulls
from
kent
i
got
all
from
kent
how
long
have
you
lived
in
c
bunyard
son
that
the
firm
they
live
just
outside
the
town
of
maidstone
do
you
keep
bees
here
one
of
these
yer
appulls
is
called
bunyard
after
the
firm
a
fine
fruit
too
your
good
wife
must
be
of
great
assistance
to
you
in
your
work
little
stalks
maybe
but
a
large
juishy
appull
for
all
that
just
then
i
heard
b
saying
to
e
aw
yes
he
very
active
for
a
little
deaf
but
he
manages
the
garden
all
i
bolsters
up
wi
meat
and
drink
little
and
often
as
they
zay
for
children
now
there
a
bootifull
tree
me
dear
that
almost
beared
itself
to
death
as
you
may
say
she
picked
an
apple
off
it
shouting
to
poor
tom
still
aloft
tom
what
the
name
of
this
one
you
should
come
a
bit
earlier
zir
replied
is
late
a
bit
now
doa
zee
no
what
its
name
i
want
shouted
his
spouse
yes
yes
give
the
lady
one
to
take
home
there
plenty
for
all
he
said
what
is
the
name
the
name
of
this
yer
appull
screamed
and
old
tom
moving
his
bones
slowly
down
from
the
tree
answered
quite
unmoved
aw
the
name
why
is
a
common
kind
of
appull
there
a
nice
tree
of
up
there
oh
never
mind
is
a
gladstone
said
turning
to
us
a
very
fine
appull
droned
the
old
boy
back
in
town
again
wandered
about
in
a
somnambulistic
way
all
the
afternoon
till
i
found
myself
taking
tea
in
kew
gardens
i
enjoyed
the
wind
in
my
face
and
hair
otherwise
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
a
colourless
day
came
across
the
following
arresting
sentence
pale
anæmic
cadaverous
bad
teeth
and
disordered
digestion
and
a
morbid
egotism
yes
but
my
teeth
are
bad
the
under
the
oak
where
i
sat
the
ground
was
covered
with
dead
leaves
i
kicked
them
and
i
beat
them
with
my
stick
because
i
was
angry
that
they
were
dead
in
the
coppice
leaves
were
quietly
and
majestically
floating
earthwards
in
the
pomp
of
death
it
was
very
thrilling
to
observe
them
it
was
a
curious
sensation
to
realise
that
since
the
last
time
i
sat
under
the
old
oak
i
had
been
right
up
to
the
of
england
then
right
down
to
the
and
back
once
more
to
london
town
i
bragged
about
my
kinetic
activity
to
the
stationary
oak
and
i
scoffed
at
the
old
hill
for
having
to
remain
always
in
the
same
place
it
gave
me
a
pleasing
sense
of
infinite
superiority
to
and
see
everything
the
same
as
before
to
sit
on
the
same
old
seat
under
the
same
old
oak
even
that
same
old
hurdle
was
lying
in
the
same
position
among
the
bracken
how
sorry
i
was
for
it
poor
wretch
unable
to
move
to
go
to
whitby
to
go
to
c
to
be
totally
ignorant
of
the
great
country
of
london
day
dreamed
my
own
life
as
it
unrolls
day
by
day
is
a
source
of
constant
amazement
delight
and
pain
i
can
think
of
no
more
interesting
volume
than
a
detailed
intimate
psychological
history
of
my
own
life
i
want
a
perfect
comprehension
at
least
of
myself
we
are
all
such
egotists
that
a
sorrow
or
hardship
provided
it
is
great
enough
flatters
our
we
feel
that
a
calamity
by
overtaking
us
has
distinguished
us
above
our
fellows
a
man
likes
not
to
be
ignored
even
by
a
railway
accident
a
man
with
a
grievance
is
always
happy
over
to
see
e
came
away
disillusioned
met
her
in
smith
book
shop
looking
quite
bewitching
hang
it
all
i
thought
i
had
finished
went
home
with
her
watched
her
make
a
pudding
in
the
kitchen
then
we
sat
by
the
firelight
in
the
and
had
supper
scrumptious
not
the
supper
quarrelled
with
d
the
atmosphere
is
changed
at
the
flat
my
character
is
ruined
d
has
told
them
i
a
loose
fellow
i
always
contrived
to
give
him
that
impression
i
liked
to
be
cutting
my
throat
and
now
it
cut
d
came
and
carried
me
off
to
the
flat
where
they
asked
why
i
been
over
which
of
course
pleased
me
immensely
doctor
m
is
very
gloomy
about
my
health
and
talks
of
africa
labrador
and
so
on
i
not
responding
to
his
treatment
as
i
should
met
her
this
evening
in
kensington
road
i
timed
this
well
said
she
i
thought
i
should
meet
you
good
heavens
i
am
getting
embroiled
returned
to
the
flat
with
her
and
after
supper
called
her
the
lady
of
shalott
i
do
think
you
know
what
you
talking
about
this
stiffly
perhaps
not
i
answered
i
leave
it
to
you
oh
but
it
rests
with
you
she
said
am
i
in
love
god
knows
but
i
do
suppose
god
cares
on
m
advice
went
to
see
a
stomach
specialist
hawkins
as
i
got
there
a
little
too
early
walked
up
the
street
portland
place
on
the
opposite
side
from
shyness
past
an
interminable
and
nauseating
series
of
night
bells
and
brass
plates
then
down
again
on
the
right
side
till
i
got
to
no
which
made
me
flutter
for
ten
doors
ahead
i
mused
is
the
house
i
must
call
at
it
made
me
shiver
a
little
the
specialist
took
copious
notes
of
my
evidence
and
after
examining
me
retired
to
consult
with
m
what
a
parade
of
ceremony
on
coming
back
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
not
proven
i
was
told
i
ought
to
go
out
and
live
on
the
prairies
and
in
two
years
i
should
be
a
but
where
are
the
prairies
what
if
i
get
worse
i
must
take
several
months
leave
i
think
it
will
come

arthur
came
down
for
the
week
end
he
likes
the
lady
of
shalott
she
is
not
handsome
but
arresting
striking
and
capable
of
tragedy
that
i
believe
she
has
achieved
already
if
she
were
a
bit
more
gloomy
and
a
bit
more
beautiful
she
be
irresistible
he
have
a
cigarette
i
enjoy
lighting
your
cigarettes
she
i
do
know
how
to
smoke
properly
he
you
smoke
only
as
could
she
how
that
gracefully
of
course
do
you
think
i
like
pretty
things
being
said
to
me
why
not
if
they
are
true
flattery
is
when
you
tell
an
ugly
woman
she
is
beautiful
have
you
so
poor
an
opinion
of
yourself
to
think
all
i
say
of
you
is
flattery
yes
i
am
only
four
bare
walls
with
nothing
inside
what
a
deliciously
empty
feeling
that
must
be
but
i
think
you
so
simple
as
all
that
you
bewilder
me
sometimes
why
i
feel
like
sindbad
the
sailor
why
because
i
not
george
meredith
the
title
of
husband
frightens
me
it
a
fearful
strain
to
go
on
endeavouring
to
live
up
to
time
with
a
carefully
of
future
achievements
i
am
hurrying
on
with
my
study
of
italian
in
order
to
read
the
life
of
spallanzani
in
order
to
include
him
in
my
book
to
be
finished
by
the
end
of
next
year
i
am
also
subsidising
jenkinson
embryological
lectures
at
university
college
with
the
more
detailed
account
of
practical
and
experimental
work
in
his
i
have
also
started
a
lengthy
research
upon
the
trichoptera
all
with
a
horrible
sense
of
time
fleeing
swiftly
and
opportunities
for
work
too
few
ever
to
be
squandered
and
in
the
background
behind
all
this
feverish
activity
the
black
shadow
that
i
might
die
suddenly
with
nothing
done
next
year
next
month
next
week
now
then
sometimes
as
i
have
misgivings
shall
i
do
these
things
so
well
now
as
i
might
once
have
done
them
has
not
my
seriously
affected
my
mental
powers
surely
the
boy
of
was
almost
a
genius
or
seen
at
this
distance
a
very
remarkable
youth
in
the
fanatical
zeal
with
which
he
sought
to
pursue
and
succeeded
in
gaining
his
own
end
of
a
zoological
education
for
himself
it
is
a
terrible
suspicion
to
cross
the
mind
of
an
ambitious
youth
that
perhaps
after
all
he
is
a
very
commonplace
mortal
that
his
life
whether
comedy
or
tragedy
or
both
or
neither
is
any
way
insignificant
of
no
account
it
is
still
more
devastating
for
him
to
have
to
consider
whether
the
laurel
wreath
was
not
once
within
his
grasp
and
whether
he
must
not
ascribe
his
own
incalculable
loss
to
his
stomach
simply
a
very
bad
heart
attack
as
i
write
it
intermits
every
three
or
four
beats
who
knows
if
i
shall
live
thro
here
i
am
once
more
a
passable
night
after
breakfast
the
intermittency
recommenced
it
is
better
now
with
a
dropped
beat
only
about
once
per
so
that
i
am
almost
happy
after
yesterday
which
was
hell
the
world
is
too
good
to
give
up
without
remonstrance
at
the
beck
of
a
weak
heart
before
i
went
to
sleep
last
night
my
watch
stopped
i
at
once
observed
the
cessation
of
its
tick
and
wondered
if
it
were
an
omen
i
was
genuinely
surprised
to
find
myself
still
ticking
when
i
awoke
this
morning
a
moment
ago
a
hearse
passed
down
the
street
yes
but
damned
if
i
have
a
right
to
be
morbid
after
yesterday
to
be
ill
like
this
in
a
i
marry
if
i
had
the
chance
ancient
hunters
read
sollas
book
very
thrilling
mind
full
of
the
aurignacians
mousterians
magdalenians
i
have
been
peering
down
such
tremendous
vistas
of
time
and
change
that
my
own
troubles
have
been
eclipsed
into
ridiculous
insignificance
it
has
been
really
a
pillar
of
strength
to
me
a
splendid
tonic
palæontology
has
its
comfortable
words
too
i
have
revelled
in
my
littleness
and
irresponsibility
it
has
relieved
me
of
the
harassing
desire
to
live
i
feel
content
to
live
dangerously
indifferent
to
my
fate
i
have
discovered
i
am
a
fly
that
we
are
all
flies
that
nothing
matters
it
a
great
load
off
my
life
for
i
do
mind
being
such
a
to
me
the
honour
is
sufficient
of
belonging
to
the
universe
such
a
great
universe
so
grand
a
scheme
of
things
not
even
death
can
rob
me
of
that
honour
for
nothing
can
alter
the
fact
that
i
lived
have
been
if
for
ever
so
short
a
time
and
when
i
am
dead
the
matter
which
composes
my
body
is
indestructible
and
eternal
so
that
come
what
may
to
my
soul
my
dust
will
always
be
going
on
each
separate
atom
of
me
playing
its
separate
part
i
shall
still
have
some
sort
of
a
finger
in
the
pie
when
i
am
dead
you
can
boil
me
burn
me
drown
me
scatter
me
but
you
can
not
destroy
me
my
little
atoms
would
merely
deride
such
heavy
vengeance
death
can
do
no
more
than
kill
you
it
is
a
pleasure
to
note
the
success
attending
the
career
of
barbellion
now
engaged
in
scientific
work
on
the
staff
of
the
natural
history
museum
etc
this
is
a
cutting
from
the
local
paper
one
of
many
that
from
time
to
time
i
once
delightedly
pasted
in
the
pages
of
the
journal
not
so
now
at
i
am
a
different
being
surrounded
by
all
the
stimulating
environment
of
scientific
research
i
am
cold
and
disdainful
i
keep
up
the
old
appearances
but
underneath
it
is
quite
different
i
am
a
i
have
to
wear
the
mask
and
cothornoi
finding
the
part
daily
more
difficult
to
bear
i
am
living
on
my
immense
initial
momentum
while
the
machinery
gradually
slows
up
my
career
gadzooks
from
the
window
i
see
pass
almost
daily
an
old
gentleman
with
white
hair
a
firm
step
broad
shoulders
healthy
pink
skin
a
sunny
smile
always
singing
to
himself
as
he
goes
a
happy
old
fellow
with
a
mind
i
should
like
to
throw
mud
at
him
by
jove
how
i
hate
him
he
makes
me
wince
with
my
own
pain
it
is
heartless
indecently
so
for
an
man
to
be
so
blithe
life
has
i
suppose
never
lain
in
wait
for
him
the
great
anarchist
has
spared
him
a
bomb
my
aunt
aged
who
has
apparently
concluded
from
my
constant
absences
from
church
that
my
spiritual
life
is
in
a
parlous
way
read
me
her
portion
from
a
large
book
with
a
broad
bookmark
i
looked
up
from
promessi
and
said
very
nice
it
was
about
someone
whose
soul
was
not
saved
and
who
would
not
answer
the
door
when
it
was
knocked
it
is
jolly
to
be
regarded
as
a
wicked
libidinous
youth
by
an
aged
maiden
aunt
this
diary
reads
for
all
the
world
as
if
i
were
not
living
in
mighty
london
the
truth
is
i
live
in
a
bigger
dirtier
city
when
chronic
is
like
a
permanent
ligature
around
life
what
a
fine
fellow
i
be
if
i
were
perfectly
well
my
energy
for
one
thing
would
lift
the
roof
off
we
conversed
around
the
text
to
travel
hopefully
is
better
than
to
arrive
and
true
success
is
to
labour
she
is
well
so
graceful
my
god
i
love
her
i
love
her
i
love
her
h
b
invited
me
to
tea
to
meet
his
fiancée
rather
pleased
with
the
invitation
i
do
know
why
for
my
idea
of
myself
is
greater
than
my
idea
of
him
and
probably
greater
than
his
idea
of
himself
yet
i
went
and
got
shaved
and
even
thought
of
buying
a
new
pair
of
gloves
but
poverty
proved
greater
than
vanity
so
i
went
with
naked
hands
on
arriving
at
turnham
green
i
removed
my
spectacles
well
knowing
how
much
they
damage
my
personal
appearance
however
the
beauty
of
the
thing
was
that
tho
i
waited
as
agreed
he
never
turned
up
and
so
i
returned
home
again
crestfallen
and
with
my
spectacles
on
again
now
w
talk
to
me
prettily
she
said
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
on
them
oh
make
him
read
a
book
whined
her
sister
but
we
talked
of
marriage
instead
in
all
its
aspects
bless
their
hearts
i
found
these
two
dear
young
things
simply
sodden
with
the
idea
of
it
in
the
middle
i
did
a
which
made
them
scream
with
laughing
the
patellar
reflex
was
new
to
them
so
i
seized
a
brush
from
the
grate
crossed
to
her
and
gently
tapped
out
shot
her
foot
and
cried
oh
do
do
it
to
me
as
well
it
was
rare
fun
oh
pretty
knee
what
do
i
see
and
he
stooped
and
he
tied
up
my
garter
for
me
news
of
scott
great
adventure
scott
dead
a
year
ago
the
news
when
i
saw
it
in
the
mall
gave
me
cold
thrills
i
could
have
wept
what
splendid
people
we
humans
are
if
there
be
no
loving
god
to
watch
us
it
a
pity
for
his
sake
as
much
as
for
our
own
tried
to
kiss
her
in
a
on
the
way
home
from
the
savoy
the
danger
is
very
present
with
us
but
she
rejected
me
quietly
sombrely
i
apologised
on
the
steps
of
the
flats
and
said
i
feared
i
had
greatly
annoyed
her
i
not
annoyed
she
said
only
surprised
in
a
thoughtful
chilly
voice
we
had
had
supper
in
soho
and
i
took
some
wine
and
she
looked
so
bewitching
it
sent
me
in
a
fever
thrumming
my
fingers
on
the
seat
of
the
cab
while
she
sat
beside
me
impassive
her
shoulders
are
exquisitely
modelled
and
a
beautiful
head
is
carried
poised
on
a
tiny
neck
walking
up
the
steps
to
her
flat
made
me
pose
to
h
who
was
with
me
as
sydney
carton
in
the
picture
in
tale
of
two
on
the
steps
of
the
scaffold
he
laughed
boisterously
as
he
is
delighted
to
know
of
my
last
evening
misadventure
at
supper
a
story
was
told
of
a
man
who
knocked
at
the
door
of
his
lady
heart
four
times
and
at
last
was
admitted
i
remarked
that
the
last
part
of
the
romance
was
weak
she
disagreed
h
exclaimed
oh
but
this
man
has
no
sentiment
at
all
so
much
the
worse
for
him
chimed
in
the
others
he
was
years
of
age
added
too
old
said
what
do
you
think
the
best
age
for
a
man
to
marry
thirty
for
a
man
for
a
woman
she
that
right
it
still
gives
me
a
little
time
what
do
think
to
me
i
replied
sardonically
a
young
man
may
not
yet
and
an
old
man
not
at
all
that
right
old
wet
blanket
chirruped
p
you
know
i
continued
delighted
to
seize
the
opportunity
to
assume
the
role
of
youthful
cynic
cupid
and
death
once
met
at
an
inn
and
exchanged
arrows
since
when
young
men
have
died
and
old
men
have
doted
h
was
charming
enough
to
opine
that
it
was
impossible
to
fix
a
time
for
love
love
simply
came
we
warned
him
to
be
careful
on
the
boat
going
out
yes
i
know
said
h
who
is
in
love
with
p
my
brother
had
a
dose
of
moonlight
on
board
a
boat
when
he
sailed
and
he
been
happy
ever
since
how
romantic
a
great
passion
the
only
difference
i
interjected
in
a
sombre
monotone
between
a
passion
and
a
caprice
is
that
the
caprice
lasts
a
little
longer
sounds
like
a
book
she
said
in
contempt
it
was
oscar
wilde
p
insisted
on
my
taking
a
biscuit
do
mind
me
she
said
just
think
i
a
waitress
and
take
no
notice
at
all
humph
i
never
see
him
taking
no
notice
of
a
waitress
sneers
and
curtain
h
came
home
last
night
and
told
me
that
she
said
as
he
came
away
tell
w
i
hate
him
so
it
all
right
i
shall
go
over
again
hurrah
my
absence
has
been
felt
then
came
home
lay
on
my
bed
still
dressed
and
ruminated
first
a
suspicion
then
a
conviction
came
to
me
that
i
was
a
cad
a
callous
selfish
cad
for
the
time
being
the
bottom
was
knocked
out
of
my
smug
for
several
long
i
found
myself
drifting
without
compass
or
stars
i
was
quite
di
orientated
temporarily
thrown
off
the
balance
of
my
then
i
got
up
lit
the
gas
and
looking
at
myself
in
the
mirror
found
it
was
really
true
i
was
a
mean
creature
wholly
absorbed
in
self
as
an
act
of
contrition
i
ought
to
have
gone
out
into
the
garden
and
eaten
worms
but
the
mirror
brought
back
my
and
i
began
to
crawl
back
into
my
recently
discarded
skin
i
began
to
be
less
loathesome
to
myself
for
as
soon
as
i
felt
interested
or
amused
or
curious
over
the
fact
that
i
had
been
really
loathesome
to
myself
i
began
to
regain
my
equilibrium
i
and
myself
are
on
comparatively
easy
terms
with
one
another
i
am
settled
on
the
old
swivel
i
take
a
lot
of
knocking
off
it
and
if
shot
off
soon
return
she
was
silent
and
melancholy
but
wonderfully
fascinating
one
day
i
am
desperate
and
the
next
cold
and
apathetic
am
i
in
love
god
knows
she
came
to
the
door
to
say
good
night
and
i
deliberately
strangled
my
desire
to
say
something
in
bed
till
reading
bergson
and
the
over
to
the
flat
to
supper
e
was
cold
and
silent
she
spurned
me
no
wonder
i
talked
volubly
and
quite
brilliantly
with
the
definite
purpose
of
showing
up
j
somnolence
i
also
pulled
his
leg
he
hates
me
no
wonder
after
supper
he
went
in
to
her
studio
and
remained
there
alone
with
her
while
she
worked
at
he
was
still
there
when
i
came
away
in
a
whirlwind
of
jealousy
regrets
and
rage
g
said
he
was
going
to
stay
on
until
he
saw
the
blighter
off
the
premises
neither
of
us
would
go
in
to
turn
him
out
i
love
her
deeply
and
once
my
heart
jumped
when
i
thought
i
heard
her
coming
into
the
room
but
it
was
only
p
did
not
see
her
again
even
to
say
work
in
the
evening
in
our
bedroom
two
poor
miserable
bachelors
h
reading
equity
law
a
rug
around
his
legs
before
an
empty
grate
while
i
am
sitting
at
the
table
in
with
collar
up
and
writing
my
opus
which
is
to
bring
me
fame
fortune
and
e
h
says
that
this
morning
i
was
putting
on
my
shoes
when
he
pointed
out
a
large
hole
in
the
heel
of
my
sock
damn
i
shall
have
to
wear
boots
i
said
at
least
he
says
i
said
it
and
i
am
quite
ready
to
believe
him
such
unconsciousness
of
self
is
rare
with
me
at
a
public
dinner
at
the
holborn
restaurant
j
replied
to
the
toast
of
the
ladies
feeble
h
and
i
stood
and
had
a
silent
toast
to
e
and
n
by
just
winking
one
eye
at
each
other
he
sat
opposite
me
if
i
had
been
asked
to
reply
to
this
toast
i
should
have
said
with
the
greatest
gusto
something
as
follows
here
follows
the
imaginary
speech
in
full
composed
the
same
night
before
going
to
sleep
yet
i
am
taken
for
a
soft
fool
my
manner
is
soft
shy
what
a
lot
of
i
lose
thereby
what
a
lot
of
i
gain
in
its
stead
went
to
the
but
did
very
little
work
thought
over
the
matter
carefully
and
decided
to
ask
e
to
marry
me
relief
to
be
able
to
decide
i
was
happy
too
yesterday
p
came
in
to
us
from
e
studio
and
said
e
sends
her
love
to
whom
h
inquired
i
do
know
p
replied
smiling
at
me
had
a
long
conversation
with
h
last
night
he
says
all
e
intended
to
convey
was
that
the
quarrel
was
over
i
felt
relieved
because
i
have
no
money
but
a
large
ambition
then
i
am
selfish
and
have
not
forgotten
that
i
want
to
spend
my
holidays
in
the
jura
and
next
year
three
weeks
at
the
plymouth
laboratory
went
over
to
see
e
we
had
an
awkward
alone
together
she
was
looking
bewitching
i
am
plunging
more
and
more
into
love
had
it
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
once
i
am
dreadfully
fond
of
her
i
have
a
most
profound
gloom
over
me
i
said
why
do
you
try
and
get
rid
of
it
she
asked
i
ca
until
zeus
has
pity
and
rolls
away
the
clouds
we
are
sitting
up
in
our
beds
which
are
side
by
side
in
a
room
on
the
top
story
of
a
boarding
house
in
road
it
is
and
i
am
leaning
over
one
one
side
lighting
the
oil
lamp
so
as
to
boil
the
kettle
to
make
ovaltine
before
going
to
sleep
whom
have
i
seduced
i
screamed
you
rotter
do
you
know
that
a
dead
passion
full
or
regrets
is
as
terrible
as
a
dead
body
full
of
worms
there
i
talk
literature
my
boy
if
you
were
only
bos
well
enough
to
take
it
down
as
for
k
i
shall
never
invite
him
to
dinner
again
he
comes
to
me
and
whines
that
nobody
loves
him
and
so
i
say
poor
lad
never
mind
if
you
bored
why
come
to
my
rooms
of
an
evening
and
hear
me
talk
you
have
the
time
of
your
life
and
now
he
cheeky
sipping
his
drink
and
very
much
preoccupied
with
it
replied
abstractedly
when
you
die
you
go
to
hell
i
liked
his
homeric
simplicity
you
ought
to
be
buried
in
a
fireproof
safe
silence
returning
to
the
attack
i
hope
she
turns
you
down
thank
you
i
said
as
for
p
he
resumed
she
to
me
go
to
the
berlitz
school
i
suggested
and
learn
the
language
you
bally
fool
all
you
do
is
to
sit
there
and
smile
like
a
sanguinary
cat
nothing
i
say
ever
rouses
you
i
believe
if
i
came
to
you
and
said
professor
is
a
beetle
with
legs
that
has
lived
on
granite
in
the
middle
of
the
sahara
for
days
and
nights
simply
answer
and
that
reminds
me
i
forgotten
to
blow
my
nose
the
two
pyjamaed
figures
shake
with
laughing
the
light
goes
out
and
the
sanguinary
conversation
continues
on
similar
lines
until
we
fall
asleep
months
sick
in
a
horrible
panic
the
last
few
days
i
believe
i
am
developing
locomotor
ataxy
one
leg
one
arm
and
my
speech
are
affected
the
right
side
and
my
speech
centre
m
is
serious
i
hope
the
disease
whatever
it
is
will
be
sufficiently
lingering
to
enable
me
to
complete
my
book
r
is
a
dear
man
i
shall
not
easily
forget
his
kindness
during
this
terrible
week
can
the
fates
have
the
audacity
who
can
say
i
believe
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
i
have
had
a
slight
partial
paralysis
of
my
right
side
like
dad
i
stutter
a
little
in
my
speech
when
excited
i
can
not
write
properly
look
at
this
handwriting
and
my
right
leg
is
rocky
at
the
knee
my
head
swims
it
is
too
inconceivably
horrible
to
be
buried
in
the
earth
in
such
splendid
spring
weather
who
can
tell
me
what
is
in
store
for
me
life
opens
to
me
i
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
vision
and
the
doors
clang
to
again
noiselessly
it
is
dark
that
will
be
my
history
am
developing
a
passionate
belief
in
my
book
and
a
fever
of
haste
to
complete
it
before
the
saw
m
again
who
said
my
symptoms
were
alarming
certainly
but
he
was
sure
no
definite
diagnosis
could
be
made
went
with
m
to
see
a
nerve
specialist
h
he
could
find
no
symptoms
of
a
definite
disease
tho
he
asked
me
suspiciously
if
i
had
ever
been
with
women
ordered
two
months
complete
rest
in
the
country
h
chased
me
round
his
consulting
room
with
a
tapping
my
nerves
and
cunningly
working
my
reflexes
then
he
tickled
the
soles
of
my
feet
and
pricked
me
with
a
pin
all
of
which
i
stood
like
a
man
he
wears
a
soft
black
hat
looks
like
a
quaker
and
reads
the
gesellschaft
m
is
religious
and
after
i
had
disclosed
my
physique
to
him
yesterday
for
the
time
he
remained
on
his
knees
by
the
couch
in
his
consulting
room
after
working
my
reflexes
for
a
moment
or
two
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
when
the
doctor
prays
for
you
better
call
in
the
undertaker
my
epitaph
he
played
ludo
well
the
game
anyhow
requires
moral
stamina
ask
h
at
r
mugged
about
all
day
put
on
a
gramophone
record
then
crawled
up
into
a
corner
of
the
large
empty
drawing
room
and
ate
my
heart
out
heart
has
a
bitter
taste
if
it
your
own
sat
in
the
morning
room
feeling
ill
in
the
chair
opposite
sat
aunt
fanny
aged
knitting
i
listened
to
the
click
of
her
needles
while
out
in
the
garden
a
thrush
sang
and
there
was
a
red
sunset
before
i
left
r
a
my
brother
had
written
to
uncle
enclosing
my
doctor
letter
i
do
know
the
details
except
that
m
emphasised
the
seriousness
and
yet
held
out
hope
that
two
months
rest
would
allay
the
symptoms
i
made
some
offensive
remark
to
h
whom
i
met
in
the
street
this
set
him
off
you
blighter
i
hope
you
marry
a
loose
woman
may
your
children
be
all
and
may
your
teeth
drop
out
and
your
toes
have
bunions
and
so
on
in
his
usual
lengthy
commination
i
turned
to
the
third
man
bob
this
after
all
i
done
for
that
young
man
i
have
even
gone
out
of
my
way
to
cultivate
in
him
a
taste
for
poetry
until
he
is
now
in
fact
quite
wrapped
up
in
it
indeed
so
much
so
that
for
a
time
he
was
nothing
but
a
brown
paper
parcel
labelled
poetry
doggedly
when
are
you
going
to
die
that
master
h
i
answered
menacingly
is
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
i
sha
believe
you
dead
till
i
see
your
tombstone
i
shall
then
say
to
the
sexton
he
really
dead
then
and
the
sexton
will
say
buried
onny
way
bob
was
not
quite
in
sympathy
with
our
boisterous
spirits
sought
out
h
as
he
was
watering
his
petunias
in
the
garden
he
informed
me
he
was
going
to
london
on
monday
mother
is
coming
too
why
oh
i
buying
my
kit
shirts
and
things
i
sail
at
the
beginning
of
july
i
suppose
shirts
are
difficult
to
buy
you
would
know
what
to
do
with
one
if
you
had
one
your
mother
will
lead
you
by
the
hand
into
a
shop
and
say
dear
this
is
a
shirt
and
you
reply
with
pathos
what
are
the
wild
shirts
saying
you
a
goes
on
watering
i
wonder
what
you
do
if
you
were
let
loose
in
a
big
garden
i
began
i
should
be
as
happy
as
a
bird
i
should
hop
about
chirrup
and
lay
eggs
you
should
have
seen
my
tomato
plants
last
year
one
was
as
tall
as
father
now
tell
me
of
the
gooseberry
as
big
as
mother
mutual
execrations
then
we
grinned
and
cackled
at
each
other
emitting
weird
and
ferocious
cachinnations
several
times
a
day
in
confidential
serious
tones
after
one
of
these
explosions
we
say
i
really
believe
we
mad
you
never
heard
such
extraordinary
caterwaulings
our
snappy
conversations
are
interrupted
with
them
every
minute
or
so
a
stagnant
day
lay
still
in
the
park
all
day
with
just
sufficient
energy
to
observe
the
park
was
almost
empty
every
one
but
me
at
work
nothing
is
more
dreary
than
a
pleasure
ground
on
workdays
there
was
one
man
a
little
way
off
throwing
a
ball
to
a
clever
dog
behind
me
on
the
path
some
one
came
along
wheeling
a
pram
i
listened
in
a
kind
of
coma
to
the
scrunching
of
the
gravel
in
the
distance
a
long
time
after
the
pram
was
out
of
sight
far
away
the
tinkle
of
church
bells
in
a
village
across
the
river
and
in
front
the
man
still
throwing
the
ball
to
his
clever
dog
i
suppose
the
truth
is
i
am
at
last
broken
to
the
idea
of
death
once
it
terrified
me
and
once
i
hated
it
but
now
it
only
annoys
me
having
lived
with
the
bogey
for
so
long
and
broken
bread
with
him
so
often
i
am
used
to
his
ugliness
tho
his
persistent
attentions
bore
me
why
does
he
do
it
and
have
done
with
me
why
this
deference
why
does
he
pass
me
everything
but
the
poison
why
am
i
such
an
unconscionably
long
time
dying
what
embitters
me
is
the
humiliation
of
having
to
die
to
have
to
be
pouring
out
the
precious
juices
of
my
life
into
the
dull
earth
to
be
no
longer
conscious
of
what
goes
on
no
longer
moving
abroad
upon
the
earth
creating
attraction
and
repulsions
pouring
out
one
ego
in
a
stream
to
think
that
the
women
i
have
loved
will
be
marrying
and
forget
and
that
the
men
i
have
hated
will
continue
on
their
way
and
forget
i
ever
hated
them
the
ignominy
of
being
dead
what
voluble
talker
likes
his
mouth
to
be
stopped
with
earth
who
relishes
the
idea
of
the
carrion
worm
mining
in
the
seat
of
the
intellect
staying
at
the
king
hotel
giddiness
very
bad
death
seems
unavoidable
a
tumour
on
the
brain
coming
down
here
in
the
train
sat
in
corner
of
the
compartment
twined
one
leg
around
the
other
rested
my
elbow
on
the
window
ledge
and
gazed
out
helplessly
at
the
exuberant
green
fields
green
woods
and
green
hedgerows
the
weather
was
perfect
the
sun
blazed
down
certainly
i
was
rather
sorry
for
myself
at
the
thought
of
leaving
it
all
but
i
girded
up
my
loins
and
wrapped
around
me
for
a
while
the
mantle
of
a
nobler
sentiment
i
felt
sorry
for
the
others
as
well
for
the
two
brown
carters
in
the
road
ambling
along
with
a
timber
waggon
for
the
two
old
maids
in
the
same
compartment
with
me
knitting
bedsocks
for
the
beautiful
swallows
darting
over
the
stream
for
the
rabbit
that
lopped
into
the
fern
just
as
we
passed
they
too
were
all
leaving
it
the
extent
of
my
benign
compassion
startled
me
it
was
so
unexpected
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
forgot
all
about
my
own
miserable
ambitions
i
forgave
the
successful
the
the
the
overweening
the
gracious
and
condescending
all
in
fact
who
hitherto
have
been
thorns
in
my
flesh
and
innocently
enough
have
goaded
me
to
still
fiercer
efforts
to
win
thro
poor
people
i
said
leave
them
alone
let
them
be
happy
if
they
can
with
a
submissive
heart
i
was
ready
to
sit
down
in
the
rows
of
this
failures
and
never
have
thought
one
bitter
word
about
success
to
all
those
persons
who
in
one
way
or
another
had
foiled
my
purposes
i
extended
a
pardon
with
olympian
gravity
and
strangest
of
all
i
could
have
melted
such
frosty
moral
rectitudes
with
a
genuine
interest
in
the
careers
of
my
struggling
contemporaries
with
perfect
i
held
out
my
hand
to
them
and
wished
them
all
god
speed
it
was
a
strange
metempsychosis
yet
of
a
truth
it
is
no
use
being
niggardly
over
our
lives
we
are
all
of
us
shelling
out
and
we
can
afford
to
be
generous
for
we
shall
all
some
early
some
late
be
bankrupt
in
the
end
for
my
part
i
had
a
short
and
boisterous
voyage
and
sha
be
sorry
to
get
into
port
i
give
up
all
my
plans
all
my
hopes
all
my
loves
and
enthusiasms
without
remonstrance
i
renounce
all
i
myself
am
already
really
dead
last
night
the
sea
was
as
flat
as
a
pavement
a
pretty
barque
with
all
her
sails
out
to
catch
the
smallest
puff
of
wind
the
tiniest
inspiration
was
nevertheless
without
motion
a
painted
ship
on
a
tapestry
of
violet
h
hill
was
an
immense
angular
mass
of
indigo
blue
even
rowing
boats
made
little
progress
and
the
water
came
off
the
languid
paddles
in
syrupy
clots
everything
was
utterly
still
the
air
thick
like
cottonwool
to
the
touch
and
very
stifling
vitality
in
living
things
leaked
away
under
a
sensuous
lotus
influence
intermittently
after
the
darkness
had
come
bullpoint
lighthouse
shone
like
the
wink
of
a
lascivious
eye
pottering
about
all
day
on
the
pier
and
front
listening
to
other
people
talk
catching
snippets
of
conversation
not
edifying
if
there
were
seven
wise
men
in
the
town
i
would
not
save
it
damn
the
place
i
espied
her
first
in
the
distance
and
turned
my
head
away
quickly
and
looked
out
to
sea
a
moment
after
i
began
to
turn
my
head
round
again
slowly
with
the
cautiousness
and
air
of
suspicion
of
a
tortoise
poking
its
head
out
from
underneath
his
shell
i
was
terrified
to
discover
that
in
the
meantime
she
had
come
and
sat
down
on
the
seat
immediately
behind
me
with
her
back
to
mine
we
sat
like
this
back
to
back
for
some
time
and
i
enjoyed
the
novel
experience
and
the
tension
a
few
years
ago
the
bare
sight
of
her
gave
me
palpitation
of
the
heart
and
on
the
first
occasion
that
i
had
the
courage
to
stop
to
speak
i
felt
livid
and
the
skin
on
my
face
twitched
uncontrollably
presently
i
got
up
and
walked
past
in
the
knowledge
that
she
must
now
be
conscious
of
my
presence
after
a
disappearance
of
three
years
later
we
met
face
to
face
and
i
broke
the
ice
she
a
pretty
girl
so
too
is
her
sister
few
people
except
my
barber
know
how
amorous
i
am
he
has
to
shave
my
sinuous
lips
spent
many
dreadful
hours
cogitating
whether
to
accept
their
invitation
to
dinner
i
wanted
to
go
for
several
reasons
i
wanted
to
see
her
in
a
for
the
first
time
and
i
wanted
to
spend
the
evening
with
three
pretty
girls
i
also
had
the
idea
of
displaying
myself
to
the
scrutinising
gaze
of
the
family
as
the
hero
of
the
old
romance
and
of
showing
her
how
much
i
had
progressed
since
last
we
met
and
what
a
treasure
she
had
lost
on
the
other
hand
i
was
afraid
that
the
invitation
was
only
a
casual
one
i
feared
a
snuffy
reception
a
frosty
smile
and
a
rigid
hand
could
i
go
up
and
partake
of
meat
at
their
board
among
brothers
and
sisters
taking
me
for
an
ogre
of
a
jilt
and
she
herself
perhaps
opposite
me
making
me
blush
perpetually
to
recall
our
passionate
kisses
our
love
letters
and
our
execrable
verses
to
each
other
there
seemed
dreadful
possibilities
in
such
an
adventure
yet
i
badly
wanted
to
experience
the
piquant
situation
at
half
an
hour
before
i
was
due
decided
on
strong
measures
i
entered
a
pub
and
took
a
stiff
whisky
and
soda
and
then
set
off
with
a
stout
heart
to
take
the
icy
family
by
storm
and
if
need
be
live
down
my
evil
reputation
by
my
amiability
and
urbanity
i
went
and
of
course
everything
passed
off
in
the
most
normal
manner
she
is
a
very
pretty
girl
like
velvet
before
dinner
we
walked
in
the
garden
and
talked
only
of
flowers
on
the
hill
this
morning
felt
the
thrill
of
the
news
of
my
own
death
i
mean
i
imagined
i
heard
the
words
you
heard
the
news
about
b
second
voice
no
what
he
dead
silence
wo
all
this
seem
piffle
if
i
do
die
after
all
as
an
artist
in
life
i
to
die
it
is
the
only
artistic
ending
and
i
ought
to
die
now
or
the
third
act
will
fizzle
out
in
a
long
doctor
bill
new
pile
in
the
watched
some
men
put
a
new
pile
in
the
pier
there
was
all
the
usual
paraphernalia
of
chains
pulleys
cranes
and
ropes
with
a
massive
wooden
pile
swinging
over
the
water
at
the
end
of
a
long
wire
hawser
everything
was
in
the
massive
style
even
the
men
very
powerful
men
slow
ruminative
silent
men
nothing
very
relevant
could
be
gathered
from
casual
remarks
the
conversation
was
without
exception
monosyllabic
let
go
or
stand
fast
but
by
close
attention
to
certain
obscure
movements
of
the
man
on
the
ladder
near
the
water
edge
it
gradually
came
thro
to
my
consciousness
that
all
these
powerful
silent
men
were
up
against
some
bitter
difficulty
i
can
not
say
what
it
was
the
burly
monsters
were
silent
about
the
matter
in
fact
they
appeared
almost
indifferent
and
tired
oh
so
very
tired
of
the
whole
business
the
attitude
of
the
man
nearest
me
was
that
for
all
he
cared
the
pile
could
go
on
swinging
in
to
the
crack
of
doom
they
continued
slow
laborious
efforts
to
overcome
the
secret
difficulty
but
these
gradually
slackened
and
finally
ceased
one
massive
man
after
another
abandoned
his
post
in
order
to
lean
over
the
rails
and
gaze
like
a
mystic
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
no
one
spoke
no
one
saw
anything
not
even
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
one
spat
and
with
round
sad
eyes
contemplated
the
trajectory
of
his
brown
bolus
he
had
been
chewing
in
its
descent
into
the
water
the
foreman
an
original
thinker
lit
a
cigarette
which
relieved
the
tension
then
slowly
and
with
majesty
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
with
the
sudden
eclipse
of
the
foreman
interest
the
incident
closed
i
should
have
been
scarcely
surprised
to
find
him
behind
the
office
playing
or
skittles
with
the
pile
still
swinging
in
after
all
it
was
only
a
bloody
pile
suffering
from
depression
the
melancholy
fit
fell
very
suddenly
all
the
colour
went
out
of
my
life
the
world
was
dirty
gray
on
the
way
back
to
my
hotel
caught
sight
of
h
jumping
into
a
cab
after
a
visit
to
s
sands
but
the
sight
of
him
aroused
no
desire
in
me
to
shout
or
wave
i
merely
wondered
how
on
earth
he
could
have
spent
a
happy
day
at
such
a
sandy
place
on
arriving
at
sank
deeper
into
my
morass
it
suffocated
me
to
find
the
old
familiar
landmarks
coming
into
view
the
along
the
streets
how
i
hated
them
the
peg
top
hill
how
desolate
all
as
before
how
dull
the
very
fact
that
they
were
all
there
as
before
in
the
morning
nauseated
me
the
here
is
magnificent
the
town
is
pretty
i
know
that
of
course
but
all
looked
dreary
and
cheerless
just
the
sort
of
feeling
one
gets
on
entering
an
empty
house
with
no
fire
on
a
winter
day
and
nowhere
to
sit
down
i
felt
as
lonely
and
desolate
as
a
man
suddenly
fallen
from
the
clouds
into
an
unknown
town
on
the
antarctic
continent
built
of
ice
and
inhabited
by
penguins
who
are
these
people
i
asked
myself
irritably
there
perhaps
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
was
my
own
brother
but
i
was
not
even
faintly
interested
and
told
the
cabman
to
drive
on
the
spray
from
the
sea
fogged
my
spectacles
and
made
me
weary
restlessness
o
the
the
restlessness
of
the
sea
acts
as
a
soporific
on
jangled
nerves
you
gaze
at
its
incessant
activities
unwillingly
at
first
because
they
distract
your
attention
from
your
own
cherished
worries
and
griefs
but
later
you
watch
with
complete
it
wrenches
you
out
of
yourself
and
eventually
with
a
kind
of
stupid
hypnotic
stare
the
day
has
been
overcast
but
a
soft
breeze
sprang
up
and
swept
the
sky
clear
as
softly
as
a
mop
the
sun
coming
out
shone
upon
a
white
sail
far
out
in
the
channel
scarcely
another
vessel
hove
in
sight
the
white
sail
glittered
like
a
piece
of
silver
paper
whenever
the
mainsail
swung
round
as
the
vessel
tacked
its
solitariness
and
whiteness
in
a
desert
of
marine
blue
attracted
the
attention
and
held
it
till
at
last
i
could
look
at
nothing
else
the
sight
of
it
so
clean
and
white
and
fair
set
me
yearning
for
all
the
rarest
and
most
exquisite
things
my
imagination
could
conjure
up
a
beautiful
girl
with
fair
and
sunburnt
skin
brown
eyes
dark
eyebrows
and
small
pretty
feet
a
dewdrop
in
a
violet
face
an
butterfly
swinging
on
an
umbel
of
a
flower
the
sail
went
on
twinkling
and
began
to
exert
an
almost
moral
influence
over
me
it
drew
out
all
the
good
in
me
i
longed
to
follow
it
on
white
wings
an
angel
i
suppose
to
quit
this
husk
of
a
body
as
raiment
put
away
and
pursue
truth
and
beauty
across
the
sea
to
the
horizon
and
beyond
the
horizon
up
the
sky
itself
to
its
last
tenuous
confines
no
doubt
with
a
still
small
voice
summoning
me
and
the
rest
of
the
elect
to
an
agapemone
with
spurgeon
at
the
door
distributing
tracts
i
can
scoff
like
this
now
but
at
the
time
my
exaltation
was
very
real
my
soul
strained
in
the
leash
i
was
full
of
a
desire
for
unattainable
spiritual
beauty
i
wanted
something
but
i
do
know
what
i
want
sense
of
my
sense
of
touch
has
always
been
morbidly
acute
i
like
to
feel
a
cigarette
locked
in
the
extreme
corner
of
my
mouth
when
i
remove
it
from
my
mouth
then
i
hold
it
probably
up
in
the
fork
between
two
fingers
if
i
am
waiting
for
a
meal
i
finger
the
cool
knives
and
forks
if
i
am
in
the
country
i
plunge
my
hands
with
outspread
fingers
into
a
mass
of
grasses
then
close
my
fingers
crush
and
decapitate
the
lot
out
at
s
a
brilliant
summer
day
up
early
breakfasted
and
clad
in
sweater
and
trousers
walked
up
the
sands
to
the
boathouse
with
bare
feet
everything
was
wonderful
i
strode
along
over
the
level
sands
infatuated
with
the
sheer
ability
to
put
one
leg
in
front
of
the
other
and
walk
i
loved
to
feel
the
muscles
of
my
thighs
working
and
to
swing
my
arms
in
rhythm
with
the
stride
the
stiff
breeze
had
blown
the
sky
clear
and
was
rushing
through
my
long
hair
and
bellowing
into
each
ear
i
strode
as
alexander
must
have
done
then
i
stretched
my
whole
length
out
along
a
flat
plank
on
the
sands
which
was
as
dry
as
a
bone
and
warm
there
was
not
a
soul
on
the
sands
everything
was
bare
clean
windswept
my
plank
had
been
washed
clean
and
white
the
sands
miles
of
it
were
hard
and
purified
level
my
eye
raced
along
in
every
direction
there
was
nothing
not
a
bird
or
a
man
to
stop
it
in
that
immense
windswept
space
nothing
was
present
save
me
and
the
wind
and
the
sea
a
flattering
moment
for
the
egotist
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
on
the
return
journey
met
an
old
man
gathering
sticks
as
he
ambled
along
dropping
sticks
into
a
long
sack
he
called
out
casually
do
you
believe
in
jesus
christ
in
the
tone
of
voice
in
which
one
would
say
i
think
we
shall
have
some
rain
before
night
aye
aye
came
the
answer
without
hesitation
from
a
boy
lying
on
his
back
in
the
sands
a
few
yards
distant
and
that
he
died
to
save
me
life
is
full
of
surprises
like
this
the
only
other
sounds
i
have
heard
were
the
herring
gull
cackle
your
own
gardener
will
one
day
look
over
his
rake
and
give
you
the
correct
chemical
formula
for
carbonic
acid
gas
i
met
a
postman
once
reading
shelley
as
he
walked
his
rounds
i
am
writing
this
by
the
lamp
in
the
cabin
among
the
sandhills
waiting
for
h
to
arrive
from
town
with
provisions
i
wear
a
pair
of
bags
a
dirty
sweater
and
go
without
hat
or
shoes
and
stockings
there
is
a
deadwood
dick
atmosphere
here
i
a
sort
of
or
rancher
off
duty
writing
home
in
a
minute
i
have
the
slightest
doubt
h
will
gallop
into
the
compound
tether
his
colt
and
come
in
raising
cain
for
a
of
red
meat
if
i
am
going
to
live
after
all
touch
wood
i
shall
go
abroad
and
be
in
the
open
i
eat
greedily
am
getting
very
sunburnt
am
growing
hairy
that
means
strength
and
utter
portentous
oaths
if
i
stayed
here
much
longer
i
should
grow
a
tail
and
climb
trees
after
a
supper
of
fried
eggs
and
fried
bread
done
to
a
nicety
turned
in
at
ten
and
both
of
us
lay
warm
and
comfortable
in
bed
smoking
cigarettes
and
listening
to
hoffmann
barcarolle
on
the
gramophone
we
put
the
lamp
out
and
it
pleased
us
to
watch
the
glow
of
each
cigarettes
in
the
dark
neither
of
us
spoke
went
to
sleep
at
midnight
awoke
at
sunrise
to
hear
an
owl
still
hooting
a
lark
singing
and
several
jackdaws
clattering
on
our
tin
roof
with
their
claws
as
they
walked
london
returned
to
london
very
depressed
am
not
so
well
as
i
was
three
weeks
ago
the
sight
of
one
eye
is
affected
and
i
am
haunted
by
the
possibility
of
blindness
then
i
have
a
numb
feeling
on
one
side
of
my
face
and
my
right
arm
is
less
mobile
left
darling
mother
in
a
very
weak
state
in
bed
with
neuritis
and
a
weak
heart
she
cried
when
i
said
goodbye
and
asked
me
to
go
to
church
as
often
as
i
could
and
to
read
a
portion
of
scripture
every
day
i
promised
then
she
added
for
dad
sake
just
as
if
i
would
not
do
it
for
her
poor
dear
she
suffers
a
deal
of
pain
she
does
not
know
how
ill
i
am
i
have
not
told
her
back
at
work
a
terrible
day
thoughts
of
suicide
a
pistol
i
get
thro
each
day
with
the
utmost
difficulty
i
have
to
wrestle
with
every
minute
each
hour
is
a
conquest
the
three
quarters
of
an
hour
at
lunch
comes
as
a
godsend
i
look
forward
to
it
all
the
morning
i
enter
into
it
with
joyful
relief
with
no
thought
of
the
dreadful
moment
impending
when
i
must
return
and
my
room
by
being
wise
like
this
i
manage
to
husband
my
spirits
and
am
relatively
cheerful
for
one
hour
in
the
middle
of
each
difficult
day
several
times
i
have
gone
to
bed
and
hoped
i
should
never
wake
up
life
grows
daily
more
impossible
i
put
a
slide
underneath
the
microscope
and
looked
at
it
it
was
like
looking
at
something
thro
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
i
sat
with
eye
glued
to
the
ocular
so
as
to
keep
up
a
pretence
of
work
in
case
some
one
came
in
my
mind
was
occupied
with
quite
different
affairs
if
one
is
pondering
on
life
and
death
it
is
a
terrible
task
to
have
to
study
mites
am
doing
no
work
at
all
i
sit
motionless
in
my
chair
and
beat
the
devil
tattoo
with
my
thumbs
and
think
think
think
in
the
same
horrible
circle
hour
after
hour
i
am
unable
to
work
i
have
the
courage
to
i
lost
my
nerve
at
five
i
return
home
to
the
and
get
more
desperate
two
old
maids
sat
down
to
dinner
one
german
youth
a
lascivious
ranting
brainless
creature
a
lady
typist
who
takes
drugs
they
say
a
dipsomaniac
who
has
monthly
bouts
h
carried
him
upstairs
and
put
him
to
bed
the
other
night
two
invertebrate
violinists
who
play
in
the
covent
garden
orchestra
a
colonial
lady
engaged
in
a
bedroom
intrigue
with
a
man
who
sits
at
my
table
what
are
these
people
to
me
i
hate
them
all
they
know
it
and
are
offended
after
dinner
put
on
my
cap
and
rushed
out
anywhere
to
escape
walked
to
the
end
of
the
street
not
knowing
where
i
was
going
or
what
doing
stopped
and
stared
with
fixed
eyes
at
the
traffic
in
kensington
road
undetermined
what
to
do
with
myself
and
unable
to
make
up
my
mind
volitional
paralysis
turned
round
walked
home
and
went
straight
to
bed
anxiously
looking
forward
to
evening
when
i
go
to
see
her
again
but
at
the
same
time
wondering
how
on
earth
i
am
to
get
through
round
before
the
evening
comes
this
is
a
existence
my
own
inner
life
is
scorching
up
all
outside
interests
zoology
appears
as
a
curious
thing
in
a
bagdad
bazaar
i
sit
in
my
room
at
the
and
play
with
it
i
let
it
trickle
thro
my
fingers
and
roll
away
like
a
child
playing
with
quicksilver
over
to
the
flat
she
was
looking
beautiful
in
a
black
dress
with
a
white
silk
blouse
and
a
byron
collar
negligently
open
in
front
as
if
a
button
had
come
out
she
said
i
varied
sometimes
i
went
up
in
her
estimation
sometimes
down
once
i
went
down
very
low
i
understood
her
to
say
i
was
now
up
alleluia
it
would
take
too
long
and
i
am
too
tired
to
write
out
all
the
varying
phases
of
this
day
life
all
its
impressions
and
petty
miseries
chasing
one
another
across
my
consciousness
or
over
my
chest
like
gleeful
fiends
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
journey
up
to
town
this
morning
i
secretly
gloated
over
the
fact
that
the
train
was
dashing
along
over
the
rails
to
london
bearing
me
and
all
the
rest
of
the
train
company
upon
their
pursuits
wealth
fame
learning
i
was
inebriated
with
the
speed
ferocity
and
dash
of
living
if
the
train
had
charged
into
the
buffers
i
should
have
hung
my
head
out
of
the
window
and
cheered
if
a
man
had
got
in
my
way
i
have
knocked
him
down
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
were
singing
a
lusty
song
in
which
i
joined
we
talked
of
men
and
women
and
she
said
she
thought
men
were
neither
angels
nor
devils
but
just
men
i
said
i
thought
women
were
either
angels
or
devils
i
am
afraid
to
ask
you
which
you
think
me
you
need
i
said
shortly
horribly
upset
with
news
from
home
mother
is
really
ill
the
doctor
fears
serious
nerve
trouble
and
says
she
will
always
be
an
invalid
this
is
awful
poor
dear
it
dreadful
and
yet
i
have
a
tiny
wish
buried
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
she
may
be
removed
early
from
us
rather
than
linger
in
pain
of
body
and
mind
especially
do
i
hope
she
may
not
live
to
hear
any
grievous
news
of
me
what
irony
that
she
should
lose
the
use
of
her
right
arm
only
two
years
after
dad
death
from
paralysis
it
is
cruel
for
it
reminds
her
of
dad
illness
what
too
would
she
think
if
she
could
have
heard
m
first
words
to
me
yesterday
on
one
of
my
periodical
visits
to
his
consulting
room
well
how
the
in
the
evening
went
over
to
see
her
she
was
wearing
a
black
silk
gown
and
looked
handsome
she
is
always
the
same
sombre
fascinating
lissom
she
she
herself
never
changes
what
am
i
to
do
i
can
not
give
her
up
and
yet
i
do
not
altogether
wish
to
take
her
to
my
heart
it
distresses
me
to
know
how
to
proceed
i
am
a
wily
fish
sat
in
the
gardens
with
her
we
sat
facing
the
sun
for
a
while
until
she
was
afraid
of
developing
freckles
and
turned
around
deliberately
turning
her
back
on
good
king
sol
i
said
it
was
disrespectful
oh
he
does
mind
she
said
he
a
dear
he
kissed
me
and
said
round
my
dear
if
you
like
is
she
tantalising
i
wanted
to
say
sarcastically
i
wonder
you
let
him
kiss
you
but
there
was
a
danger
of
the
remark
reviving
the
dead
i
tried
my
best
i
sought
every
loophole
of
escape
but
i
am
quite
unable
to
avoid
the
melancholy
fact
that
her
thumbs
are
lamentable
i
am
genuinely
upset
about
it
for
i
like
her
no
one
more
than
i
would
be
more
delighted
if
they
were
otherwise
poor
dear
how
i
love
her
that
why
i
so
concerned
about
her
thumbs

away
yesterday

yesterday
afternoon
i
was
writing
zoology
and
all
last
night
i
slept
soundly
it
was
quite
sudden
caught
the
first
train
home
the
funeral
staying
at
the
hotel
du
guesclin
at
cancale
near
malo
with
my
dear
a
this
flood
of
new
experiences
has
knocked
my
diary
habit
out
of
gear
to
be
candid
i
forgotten
all
about
myself
i
been
too
engrossed
in
living
to
stand
the
strain
of
setting
down
and
in
cold
blood
writing
out
all
the
things
seen
and
heard
if
i
once
began
i
should
blow
thro
these
pages
like
a
whirlwind
but
what
a
waste
of
time
with
le
batelier
waiting
outside
with
his
bisque
to
take
us
mackerel
fishing
returned
to
southampton
yesterday
have
spent
the
night
at
okehampton
in
devonshire
for
t
rectory
this
morning
we
hatched
the
ridiculous
idea
of
hiring
two
little
dartmoor
ponies
and
riding
out
from
the
town
a
rides
fairly
well
tho
he
has
not
been
astride
a
beast
for
years
as
for
me
i
can
not
ride
at
all
yet
i
had
the
idea
that
i
could
easily
manage
a
pretty
little
pony
with
brown
eyes
and
a
long
tail
on
going
out
into
the
inn
yard
was
horrified
two
horses
saddled
one
a
large
traction
beast
i
climbed
on
to
the
smaller
one
walked
him
out
of
the
yard
and
down
the
road
in
good
style
without
accident
once
in
the
country
however
my
animal
the
fresher
of
the
two
insisted
on
a
smart
trot
which
shook
me
up
a
good
deal
so
that
i
hardly
kept
my
seat
this
eventually
so
annoyed
the
animal
that
it
began
to
fidget
and
zigzag
across
the
road
no
doubt
preparing
to
break
away
at
a
stretch
gallop
when
once
it
had
rid
itself
of
the
incomprehensible
pair
of
legs
across
its
back
i
got
off
quickly
and
swopped
horses
with
a
walked
him
most
of
the
way
while
a
cantered
forward
and
back
to
cheer
me
on
ultimately
however
this
beast
too
got
sick
of
walking
and
began
to
trot
for
a
time
i
stood
this
well
and
began
to
rise
in
my
saddle
quite
nicely
after
two
miles
horrible
soreness
supervened
and
i
had
to
get
off
very
carefully
with
a
funny
feeling
in
my
legs
even
looked
down
at
them
to
assure
myself
they
were
not
bandy
in
doing
so
the
horse
this
traction
monster
stepped
on
my
toe
and
i
swore
on
nearing
the
village
l
arrived
riding
a
animal
and
holding
his
sides
for
laughing
at
me
as
i
crawled
along
holding
the
carthorse
by
the
bridle
got
on
again
and
rode
into
the
rectory
grounds
in
fine
style
like
a
dashing
cavalier
every
one
jeering
at
me
from
the
lawn
having
lived
on
this
planet
now
for
the
space
of
years
i
can
claim
with
some
cogency
that
i
am
qualified
to
express
some
sort
of
opinion
about
it
i
therefore
hereby
record
that
i
find
myself
in
an
absorbingly
interesting
place
where
i
live
move
and
have
my
being
dominated
by
one
monstrous
feature
above
all
others
the
mystery
of
it
all
everything
is
so
astonishing
my
own
existence
so
incredible
nothing
explains
itself
every
one
is
dumb
it
is
like
walking
about
at
a
masqued
ball
even
i
myself
am
a
mystery
to
me
how
wonderful
and
frightening
that
is
to
feel
yourself
your
innermost
and
most
substantial
possession
to
be
a
mystery
incomprehensible
i
look
at
myself
in
the
mirror
and
mock
at
myself
on
some
days
i
am
to
myself
as
strange
and
unfamiliar
as
a
pterodactyl
there
is
a
certain
grim
humour
in
finding
myself
here
possessed
of
a
perfectly
arbitrary
arrangement
of
lineaments
when
i
never
asked
to
be
here
and
never
selected
my
own
attributes
to
the
dignity
of
a
human
being
it
seems
like
a
coarse
practical
joke
my
own
freakish
physique
is
certainly
a
joke
london

in

nods
to

her

around

neck
and
says
oh
you

you
got
a
cold
i
should
do

awful

she
oh
i
do
mind
k
laughter
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
last
night
and
thinking
it
was
r
i
unbolted
it
and
let
in
a
tramp
who
at
once
asked
god
to
bless
me
and
crown
all
my
sorrow
with
joy
an
amiable
fellow
to
be
sure
so
i
gave
him
some
coppers
and
he
at
once
repeated
with
wonderful
fervour
god
bless
you
sir
i
wish
he
would
i
answered
i
have
a
horrible
cold
ah
i
know
i
gets
it
myself
and
the
hinfluenza
have
you
had
that
sir
in
ten
minutes
i
should
have
told
him
all
my
personal
history
but
he
was
thirsting
for
a
drink
and
went
off
quickly
and
left
me
with
my
heart
unburthened
london
is
a
lonely
place
journeyed
to
where
i
gave
evidence
as
an
in

entomology
at
the
county
court
in
a
case
concerning
damage
to
furniture
by
mites
for
which
i
am
paid

and
expenses
and
travelled

what
irony
see
june
i
may
be
a
weak
maundering
vacillating
fool
but
i
can
not
help
loving
her
on
one
day
being
indifferent
the
next
and
on
some
occasions
even
disliking
her
she
was
charming
with
a
certain
warm
glossy
perfection
on
her
face
and
hair
and
she
loves
me
i
could
swear
it
and
when
a
woman
woos
etc
how
difficult
for
a
vain
and
lonely
man
to
resist
her
she
tells
me
many
times
in
many
dainty
ways
that
she
loves
me
without
so
much
as
stopping
her
work
to
talk
i
wish
i
were
permanently
and
irresistibly
enamoured

went
to
see
a
harley
street
oculist
about
the
sight
of
one
eye
which
has
caused
a
lot
of
trouble
and
worry
of
late
and
continuously
haunted
me
with
the
possibility
of
blindness
at
times
i
see
men
as
trees
walking
and
print
becomes
hopelessly
blurred
the
specialist
however
is
reassuring
the
eye
is
healthy
no
neuritis
but
the
adjustment
muscles
have
been
thrown
out
of
gear
by
the
nervous
troubles
of
last

sorely
tempted
here

i
lonely
and

british

reading
i
saw
it
for
the
first
time

this
is
the
only
fit
ejaculation
to
express
my
amazement
it
a
pagan
temple
with
the
gods
in
the
middle
and
all
around
various
obscure
dark
figures
prostrating
themselves
in
worship
for
any
one
who
is
not
simply
a
sheep
or
cow
or
whose
nervous
organisation
is
a
degree
more
sensitive
than
the
village
blacksmith
it
is
a
besetting
peril
to
his
peace
of
mind
to
be
constantly
moving
about
an
independent
being
with
loves
and
hates
and
a
separate
identity
among
other
separate
identities

prowl
and
prowl
around

among
my
fellows

me
to
a
frenzy
by
the
evening
i
am
no
longer
fit
for
human
companionship
people
string
me
up
to
concert
pitch
i
develop
suspicions
of
one
that
he
is
prying
of
another
that
he
patronises
others
make
me
horribly
anxious
to
stand
well
in
their
eyes
and
horribly
curious
to
know
what
they
think
of
me
others
i
hate
and
loathe
for
no
particular
reason
there
is
a
man
i
am
acquainted
with
concerning
whom
i
know
nothing
at
all
he
may
be
jew
gentile
socinian
anabaptist
rosicrucian
i
do
know
and
i
do
care
for
i
hate
him
i
should
like
to
smash
his
face
in
i
do
know
why
in
the
whole
course
of
our
tenuous
acquaintance
we
have
spoken
scarce
a
dozen
words
to
each
other
yet
i
should
like
to
blow
up
his
face
with
dynamite
if
i
had
a
year
private
income
i
should
be
in
wait
for
him
round
a
corner
and
land
him
one
just
to
indicate
my
economic
independence
he
would
call
for
the
police
and
the
policeman
discerning
creature
on
arrival
would
surely
say
with
a
face
like
that
i
not
surprised
r
said
to
me
this
morning
well
have
you
heard
with
an
exuberance
of
curiosity
that
made
my
blood
boil
he
was
referring
to
my
essay
still
at
the
bar
of
the
opinion
of
the
editor
of
the
you
beast
i
snapped
and
walked
off
r
shouted
with
laughter
for
he
realizes
my
anger
with
him
is
only
it
is
meant
and
not
meant
meant
for
it
is
justified
by
the
facts
not
meant
for
i
ca
be
too
serious
over
anything
of
all
the
grim
and
ridiculous
odds
and
ends
of
chance
that
fortune
has
rolled
up
to
my
feet
my
friendship
with
a
man
like
b
is
the
grimmest
and
most
ridiculous
he
is
a
bachelor
of
sixty
rather
of
powerful
physique
and
a
faultless
constitution
his
ignorance
is
colossal
and
he
once
asked
whether
australia
for
example
tho
surrounded
by
water
is
not
connected
up
with
other
land
underneath
the
sea
being
himself
a
child
in
intelligence
tho
commercially
cunning
he
has
a
great
respect
for
my
brains
being
himself
a
strong
man
he
views
my
with
much
contempt
his
private
opinion
is
that
i
am
in
consumption
when
asked
once
by
a
lady
if
i
were
not
going
to
be
a
great
man
one
day
he
replied
yes
if
he
lives
i
ought
to
walk
six
miles
a
day
drink
a
bottle
of
stout
with
my
dinner
and
eat
plenty
of
his
belief
in
the
curative
properties
of
onions
is
strong
as
death
his
system
of
prophylaxis
may
be
quickly
summarised
hot
whisky
and
off
to
bed
a
woman
these
two
sterling
preventives
he
has
often
urged
upon
me
at
the
same
time
tipping
out
a
quantity
of
anathemas
on
doctors
and
physic
he
is
a
cynic
he
scoffs
at
the
medical
profession
the
law
the
church
the
press
every
man
is
guilty
until
he
is
proved
innocent
the
premier
is
an
unscrupulous
character
the
bishop
a
salacious
humbug
no
doctor
will
cure
for
it
pays
him
to
keep
you
every
clergyman
puts
the
teacher
in
the
family
way
his
mouth
is
permanently
distorted
by
cynicism
he
is
vain
and
believes
all
women
are
in
love
with
him
when
playing
the
gallant
he
turns
on
a
special
voice
wears
white
spats
and
looks
like
a
newmarket
crook
i
lost
my
a
girl
says
to
him
lost
your
bust
he
answers
in
broad
scotch
i
ca
see
that
you
done
that
his
sexual
career
has
been
a
remarkable
one
he
claiming
to
have
brought
many
women
to
bed
and
actually
to
have
lain
with
women
of
almost
all
european
nationalities
for
he
has
been
a
great
traveller
this
man
is
my
devoted
friend
and
truth
to
tell
i
get
on
with
him
better
than
i
do
with
most
people
i
like
his
gamey
flavour
his
utter
absence
of
and
his
doggy
loyalty
to
myself
his
weaker
brother
he
may
be
depraved
in
his
habits
coarse
in
his
language
boorish
in
his
manners
ludicrous
in
the
wrongness
of
all
his
views
but
i
like
him
just
because
he
is
so
hopeless
i
get
on
with
him
because
it
is
so
impossible
to
reclaim
him
my
missionary
spirit
is
not
intrigued
if
he
only
dabbled
in
vice
for
an
experiment
if
he
had
pale
watery
ideas
about
current
literature
if
to
use
his
own
favourite
epithet
he
were
i
should
quarrel
having
developed
a
passion
for
a
piece
of
sculpture
by
boeltzig
called
the
reifenwerferin
the
most
beautiful
figure
of
a
woman
i
am
already
devoted
to
rodin
kiss
and
have
a
photo
of
it
framed
in
my
bedroom
have
written
to
bruciani
i
suspect
that
my
growing
appreciation
of
the
plastic
art
is
with
me
only
distilled
sensuality
i
enjoy
my
morning
bath
for
the
same
reason
my
bath
is
a
daily
baptism
i
revel
in
the
pleasure
of
the
pain
of
the
cold
water
i
whistle
gleefully
because
i
am
clean
and
cool
and
nude
early
in
the
morning
with
the
sun
still
low
before
the
day
has
been
stained
by
clothes
dirt
pain
exasperation
death
how
i
love
myself
as
i
rub
myself
down
the
cool
pink
skin
i
could
eat
it
i
want
to
be
all
day
in
a
cold
bath
to
enjoy
the
pain
of
mortifying
the
flesh
it
is
so
beautiful
so
soft
so
inscrutabl
if
i
cut
out
chunks
of
it
it
would
only
bleed
the
other
morning
r
said
hyperbolically
that
he
had
slept
all
night
for
fear
that
before
he
had
time
to
put
an
arresting
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
say
do
i
might
have
gone
and
become
entangled
no
i
as
firm
as
a
rock
my
dear
but
in
imagination
the
affair
was
continued
as
follows
she
i
am
fond
of
you
you
know
he
i
wish
you
would
say
these
things
to
me
they
quite
embarrassing
she
oh
my
dear
i
not
serious
you
know
you
such
a
vain
young
man
he
well
it
equally
embarrassing
any
way
she
then
i
serious
tears
i
say
i
wish
you
would
take
me
only
for
what
i
am
a
blackguard
with
no
good
intentions
yet
no
very
evil
ones
but
still
a
blackguard
whom
you
seem
to
find
has
engaging
manners
i
breathe
freely
hoping
to
have
escaped
this
terrible
temptation
and
turn
to
go
but
she
looking
up
smiling
thro
a
curtain
of
wet
eyelashes
asks
wo
the
blackguard
stop
a
little
longer
in
a
moment
my
earth
works
redoubts
and
bastions
fall
down
i
rush
forward
impetuously
into
her
arms
shouting
i
i
i
will
as
long
as
for
eternity
curtain
i
dramatised
this
little
picture
and
much
more
last
night
before
going
to
sleep
when
i
was
in
a
fever
i
should
succumb
at
once
to
the
first
really
skilful
coquette
we
played
ludo
together
this
evening
and
she
won
handsomely
gowned
in
black
and
wearing
black
ornaments
she
sat
with
me
in
the
lamplight
on
the
sofa
in
the
morris
room
with
the
ludo
board
between
us
placed
on
a
large
green
cushion
her
face
was
white
as
parchment
and
her
hair
seemed
an
ebony
black
i
lolled
in
the
opposite
corner
a
thin
elongated
youth
with
fair
hair
all
stivvered
up
dressed
in
a
lounge
suit
with
a
good
trouser
crease
a
soft
linen
collar
and
a
red
tie
between
us
on
its
green
cushion
the
ludo
board
with
its
brilliantly
coloured
squares
all
of
it
set
before
a
background
formed
by
the
rectangular
sofa
with
a
charming
covering
which
went
with
the
rest
of
the
scheme
rather
decorative
remarked
in
an
audible
voice
turning
her
head
on
one
side
and
quizzing
i
can
well
believe
it
was
looked
wholly
admirable
ca
get
rid
of
my
cough
i
have
so
many
things
to
do
i
am
living
in
a
fever
of
haste
to
get
them
done
yet
this
cough
hinders
me
there
is
always
something
which
drags
me
back
from
the
achievement
of
my
desires
it
like
a
nightmare
i
see
myself
struggling
violently
to
escape
from
a
monster
which
draws
continuously
nearer
until
his
shadow
falls
across
my
path
when
i
begin
to
run
and
find
my
legs
tied
etc
the
only
difference
is
that
mine
is
a
nightmare
from
which
i
never
wake
up
the
haven
of
successful
accomplishment
remains
as
far
off
as
ever
oh
make
haste
the
has
returned
my
essay
this
is
a
keen
disappointment
to
me
i
wish
i
could
use
this
but
i
am
really
too
full
the
editor
writes
to
be
faintly
encouraged
and
delicately
rejected
why
i
prefer
the
printed
form
renewed
my
cold
i
do
nothing
all
day
but
blow
my
nose
cough
and
curse
austin
harrison
m
thinks
the
lungs
are
all
right
there
is
nothing
there
i
think
said
he
this
morning
alleluia
i
had
visions
of
consumption
for
weeks
past
and
m
himself
has
been
expecting
it
i
always
just
escape
i
always
almost
get
something
do
something
go
somewhere
i
have
dabbled
in
a
variety
of
diseases
but
never
got
one
downright
but
only
enough
to
make
me
feel
horribly
unfit
and
very
miserable
without
the
consolation
of
being
able
to
regard
myself
as
the
heroic
victim
of
some
incurable
disorder
instead
of
being
stevenson
with
tuberculosis
i
only
been
jones
with
dyspepsia
so
too
in
other
directions
big
events
have
always
just
missed
me
by
herculean
efforts
i
succeeded
in
giving
up
newspaper
journalism
and
breaking
thro
that
steel
environment
but
only
to
become
an
entomologist
i
once
achieved
success
in
an
essay
in
the
which
attracted
attention
a
debut
however
that
never
developed
i
had
not
quite
arrived
it
is
always
yesterday
i
received
a
state
visit
from
the
editor
of
the
seeking
advice
on
how
to
eradicate
mites
from
upholstering
i
received
him
ironically
but
little
did
he
understand
i
shot
up
like
a
ball
on
a
bagatelle
board
all
steamy
into
zoology
my
once
beloved
science
but
at
once
rolled
dead
into
the
very
low
hole
of
economic
entomology
curse
why
ca
i
either
have
a
disease
or
be
a
zoologist
now
just
think
what
a
much
better
figure
i
should
have
cut
from
the
artistic
view
point
had
i
remained
a
newspaper
reporter
who
had
taught
himself
prodigious
embryology
out
of
balfour
textbook
who
had
cut
sections
of
fowls
eggs
and
newt
embryos
with
a
hand
microtome
who
had
passionately
dissected
out
the
hidden
internal
anatomy
of
a
great
variety
of
animals
who
could
recite
wiedersheim
anatomy
of
and
patter
off
the
difference
between
a
nephridium
and
a
cœlomic
duct
without
turning
a
hair
or
the
phylogenetic
history
how
absorbing
of
the
kidney
pronephros
mesonephros
and
metanephros
and
all
the
ducts
all
this
over
now
and
wasted
my
knowledge
wrenched
away
is
never
brought
into
use
it
lies
piled
up
in
my
brain
rotting
i
could
have
become
a
comparative
anatomist
cold
better
so
back
at
work
gauging
ale
at
dunfermline
as
r
puts
it
in
the
evening
found
it
quite
impossible
to
stay
in
the
house
any
longer
some
vague
fear
drove
me
out
i
was
alarmed
to
be
alone
or
to
be
still
it
is
my
cough
i
think
had
two
glasses
of
port
at
the
kensington
hotel
conversed
with
the
barmaid
and
then
came
home
do
be
an
old
fossil
she
said
to
me
irrelevantly
of
what
i
inquired
mother
here
w
proposing
to
e
do
come
cried
with
intent
to
confuse
i
laughed
heartlessly
dear
dear
where
will
it
all
end
it
a
sad
business
when
you
fall
in
love
with
a
girl
you
do
like
spent
a
romping
day
at
the
flat
kissed
her
sister
twice
under
the
mistletoe
and
in
the
evening
went
to
a
cinema
after
supper
made
a
mock
heroic
speech
and
left
hilarious
the
life
of
the
soul
is
different
there
is
nothing
more
changing
more
varied
more
restless
to
describe
the
incidents
of
one
hour
would
require
an
eternity
of
eugénie
de
see
entry
for
november
finally
and
in
conclusion
i
have
fallen
ill
again
have
again
resumed
my
periodical
visits
to
the
doctor
and
am
swallowing
his
in
a
blind
faith
as
aforetime
in
fact
i
am
in
london
leading
the
same
solitary
life
seeing
no
one
talking
to
no
one
and
daily
struggling
with
this
demon
of
can
no
one
exorcise
him
the
sight
of
my
eyes
is
affected
now
blindness
b
continues
whoring
drinking
sneering
r
as
usual
devoid
of
emotion
cold
passionless
shavian
and
still
titillates
his
mind
with
etching
sociology
music
and
i
have
at
last
ceased
to
bore
him
with
what
he
probably
calls
the
febrile
utterances
of
an
overwrought
mind
such
is
my
world
oh
i
forgot
on
the
floor
below
me
is
a
corpse
that
of
an
old
gentleman
who
passed
away
suddenly
in
the
night
in
the
small
hours
the
landlady
went
for
the
doctor
over
the
way
but
he
refused
to
come
saying
the
old
man
was
too
aged
so
the
poor
gentleman
died
alone
in
this
rat
hole
of
a
place
intending
to
buy
my
usual
packet
of
goldflakes
entered
a
tobacconist
in
piccadilly
but
once
inside
surprised
to
find
myself
in
a
classy
establishment
which
frightened
my
flabby
nature
into
buying
de
reszke
instead
i
had
the
courage
to
face
the
aristocrat
behind
the
counter
with
a
request
for
goldflakes
probably
not
stocked
what
would
he
think
of
me
besides
i
shrank
from
letting
him
see
i
was
not
perfectly
i
wonder
what
this
year
has
in
store
for
me
the
first
years
of
my
life
have
hunted
me
up
and
down
the
keyboard
i
have
been
right
to
the
top
and
also
to
the
bottom
very
happy
and
very
miserable
yet
i
prefer
the
life
that
is
a
hunt
and
an
adventure
i
do
really
mind
being
chased
like
this
i
almost
thrive
on
the
excitement
if
i
knew
always
where
to
look
with
any
degree
of
certainty
for
my
next
day
life
i
should
yawn
what
if
be
sweet
i
say
and
never
look
ahead
to
me
next
week
is
next
century
the
danger
and
uncertainty
of
my
life
make
me
cherish
and
hug
closely
to
my
heart
various
little
projects
that
otherwise
would
seem
unworthy
i
work
at
them
quickly
frantically
sometimes
afraid
to
whisper
to
a
living
soul
what
expectations
i
dare
to
harbour
in
my
heart
what
if
the
end
be
near
not
a
word
let
me
go
onward
i
have
reviewed
the
situation
carefully
exhaustively
i
have
peered
into
every
aspect
of
my
life
and
achievements
and
everything
i
have
seen
nauseates
me
i
can
find
no
ray
of
comfort
in
anything
i
have
done
or
in
anything
i
might
do
my
life
seems
to
have
been
a
wilderness
of
futile
endeavour
i
started
wrong
from
the
very
beginning
at
the
moment
of
my
birth
i
was
coming
into
the
world
in
the
wrong
place
and
under
wrong
conditions
why
seek
to
overcome
such
colossal
initial
disadvantages
in
this
mood
i
found
fault
with
my
parentage
my
inheritance
all
my
mental
and
physical
disabilities
this
must
be
a
form
of
incipient
insanity
even
as
a
boy
i
can
remember
being
preternaturally
absorbed
in
myself
and
preternaturally
discontented
i
was
accustomed
to
exhaust
my
mind
by
the
most
harassing
no
counsel
at
the
bar
ever
treated
a
witness
more
mercilessly
after
a
day
of
this
sort
of
thing
when
silently
and
morbidly
in
every
spare
moment
at
meals
in
school
or
on
a
walk
i
would
incessantly
ply
the
questions
what
is
the
ultimate
value
of
your
work
etc
i
went
to
bed
in
the
evening
with
a
feeling
of
hopelessness
and
dissatisfaction
haggard
with
considerations
and
reconsiderations
of
my
outlook
my
talent
my
character
my
future
in
bed
i
tossed
from
side
to
side
mentally
exhausted
with
my
efforts
to
obtain
some
satisfying
conclusion
always
hopeful
determined
to
the
last
to
be
able
to
square
up
my
little
affairs
before
going
to
sleep
but
out
of
this
mazy
vertiginous
mass
of
thinking
no
satisfaction
ever
came
i
thought
or
the
or
as
soon
as
i
review
and
revise
myself
in
this
or
in
that
aspect
i
shall
be
content
and
so
i
went
on
tearing
down
and
reforming
revising
and
reviewing
till
finally
from
sheer
exhaustion
and
very
unhappy
i
fell
asleep
next
morning
i
was
all
right
am
feeling
very
unwell
my
my
isolation
baulked
ambitions
and
daily
breadwinning
all
conspire
to
bring
me
down
the
idea
of
a
pistol
and
the
end
of
it
grows
on
me
day
by
day
after
four
days
of
the
most
profound
depression
of
spirits
bitterness
despair
i
emerged
from
the
cloud
quite
suddenly
probably
the
arsenic
and
strychnine
begins
to
take
effect
and
walked
up
exhibition
road
with
the
intention
of
visiting
the
science
museum
library
so
as
to
refer
to
schafer
of
i
have
to
watch
myself
carefully
so
that
i
may
act
as
soon
as
the
balance
of
mind
is
restored
in
the
lobby
was
a
woman
screaming
as
if
in
pain
with
a
at
her
side
saying
sternly
what
is
the
matter
with
you
as
if
she
were
making
herself
ridiculous
by
suffering
pain
in
public
i
passed
by
quickly
pretending
not
to
notice
lest
after
all
i
should
be
done
out
of
my
of
even
in
the
library
i
very
nearly
let
the
opportunity
slide
by
picking
up
a
book
on
squaring
the
circle
the
preface
and
introduction
of
which
i
was
forced
to
read
entomological
there
were
a
great
many
scarabees
present
who
exhibited
to
one
another
poor
little
pinned
insects
in
it
was
really
a
show
poulton
a
man
of
very
considerable
scientific
attainments
being
present
and
shouting
with
a
raucous
voice
in
a
way
that
must
have
scared
some
of
the
timid
unassuming
collectors
of
our
country
butterflies
and
moths
like
a
great
powerful
he
got
up
and
barked
mendelian
characters
or
germ
plasm
what
time
the
obedient
flock
ran
together
and
bleated
a
pitiful
applause
i
suppose
having
frequently
heard
these
and
similar
phrases
fall
from
the
lips
of
the
great
man
at
these
reunions
they
have
come
to
regard
them
as
symbols
of
a
ritual
which
they
think
it
pious
to
accept
without
any
question
so
every
time
the
professor
says
allelomorph
or
some
such
phrase
they
cross
themselves
and
never
venture
to
ask
him
what
the
hell
it
is
all
about
scots
have
been
feeling
very
down
of
late
but
yesterday
i
saw
a
fine
scots
fir
by
the
roadside
tall
erect
as
straight
as
a
parthenon
pillar
the
sight
of
it
restored
my
courage
it
had
a
tonic
effect
quite
unconsciously
i
pulled
my
shoulders
back
and
walked
ahead
with
renewed
vows
never
to
flinch
again
it
is
a
noble
tree
it
has
strength
as
a
giant
and
a
giant
height
and
yet
kindly
withal
the
branches
drooping
down
graciously
towards
you
like
a
kind
giant
extending
its
hands
to
a
child
stagnant
went
to
bed
late
last
night
so
i
slept
on
soundly
till
went
down
to
the
but
found
the
door
was
shut
so
went
back
to
my
bedroom
again
lay
down
and
dosed
a
while
thinking
of
nothing
in
particular
went
down
again
door
still
locked
swore
returned
once
more
to
my
room
and
reclined
on
the
bed
with
door
open
so
that
i
could
hear
as
soon
as
the
door
opened
rang
the
bell
and
miss
brought
up
a
jug
of
hot
water
to
shave
with
and
a
tumbler
of
hot
water
to
drink
for
my
dyspepsia
she
on
being
interrogated
said
there
was
some
one
in
the
i
said
i
wanted
a
bath
too
so
as
she
passed
on
her
way
down
she
shouted
hurry
up
barbellion
wants
a
bath
as
well
her
footsteps
then
died
away
as
she
descended
lower
into
the
basement
where
the
family
lives
sleeps
and
cooks
our
food
at
length
hearing
the
door
open
i
ejaculated
the
lord
be
praised
rushed
down
entered
the
and
secured
it
from
further
intruders
i
observed
that
miss
senior
had
been
bathing
her
members
and
that
the
bath
tho
empty
was
covered
inside
with
patches
of
soap
unutterably
black
oh
miss
dressed
leisurely
and
breakfasted
when
the
table
was
cleared
wrote
a
portion
of
my
essay
on
then
being
giddy
and
tired
rang
for
dinner
miss
laid
the
table
she
looked
very
clean
i
said
and
she
suitably
replied
and
i
went
on
reading
the
felt
too
slack
to
be
amiable
next
time
she
came
in
i
said
as
pleasantly
as
i
could
is
it
all
ready
and
being
informed
proceeded
to
eat
forthwith
in
the
afternoon
took
a
to
richmond
no
room
outside
so
had
to
go
inside
curse
and
sit
opposite
a
row
curse
again
of
fat
ugly
elderly
women
all
off
to
visit
their
married
daughters
the
usual
sunday
jaunt
at
hammersmith
got
on
the
outside
and
at
turnham
green
was
caught
in
a
hail
storm
very
cold
all
of
a
sudden
so
got
off
and
took
shelter
in
the
doorway
of
a
shop
which
was
of
course
closed
the
day
being
sunday
rain
wind
and
hail
continued
for
some
while
as
i
gazed
at
the
wet
almost
empty
street
thinking
and
thinking
over
again
the
same
thought
that
the
ride
along
this
route
was
exceptionally
cheap
probably
because
of
competition
with
the
trams
the
next
took
me
to
richmond
two
young
girls
sat
in
front
and
kept
looking
back
to
know
if
i
was
game
i
looked
them
walked
in
the
park
just
conscious
of
the
singing
of
larks
and
the
chatter
of
jays
but
harassed
mentally
by
the
question
to
whom
shall
i
send
my
essay
when
finished
to
shelter
from
the
rain
sat
under
an
oak
where
four
youths
joined
me
and
said
worse
luck
and
not
half
and
smoked
cigarettes
they
gossipped
and
giggled
like
girls
put
their
arms
around
each
other
necks
at
the
dinner
last
night
they
said
they
had
duck
and
tomato
soup
and
beeswax
beesley
you
know
the
chap
that
goes
about
with
smith
a
lot
wore
a
fancy
waistcoat
with
a
dinner
jacket
when
i
got
up
to
move
on
they
became
convulsed
with
laughter
i
scowled
had
tea
in
the
pagoda
dry
toast
and
brown
bread
and
butter
two
young
men
opposite
me
were
quietly
playing
the
fool
hold
my
hand
one
said
audibly
enough
for
two
lovers
to
hear
comfortably
settled
up
in
a
corner
even
at
a
side
view
i
could
see
them
kissing
each
other
in
between
mouthfuls
of
bread
and
butter
and
jam
on
rising
to
go
one
of
the
two
hilarious
youths
removed
my
cap
and
playfully
placed
it
on
top
of
the
bowler
which
his
friend
was
wearing
my
cap
i
think
i
said
sharply
and
the
young
man
apologised
with
a
splutter
i
glared
like
a
of
sixty
on
the
coming
home
thro
streets
full
of
motor
traffic
and
all
available
space
plastered
with
advertisements
that
screamed
at
you
i
espied
in
front
three
pretty
girls
who
gave
me
the
glad
eye
one
had
a
deep
musical
voice
and
kept
on
using
it
one
of
the
others
a
pretty
ankle
and
kept
on
showing
it
at
kew
two
italians
came
aboard
one
of
whom
went
out
of
his
way
to
sit
among
the
girls
he
sat
level
with
them
and
kept
turning
his
head
around
giving
them
a
sweeping
glance
as
he
did
so
to
shout
remarks
in
italian
to
his
friend
behind
he
thought
the
girls
were
prostitutes
i
think
and
he
may
have
been
right
i
was
on
the
seat
behind
this
man
and
for
want
of
anything
better
to
do
studied
his
face
minutely
in
short
it
was
fat
round
and
greasy
he
wore
black
moustachios
with
curly
ends
his
eyes
were
dark
shining
bulgy
and
around
his
neck
was
wrapped
a
scarf
inside
a
dirty
linen
collar
as
if
he
had
a
sore
throat
i
sat
behind
him
and
hated
him
steadily
perseveringly
at
hammersmith
the
three
girls
got
off
and
the
italian
watched
them
go
with
lascivious
eyes
looking
over
the
rail
and
down
at
them
on
the
pavement
still
interested
i
looked
down
too
they
crossed
the
road
in
front
of
us
and
disappeared
came
home
and
here
i
am
writing
this
this
is
the
content
of
consciousness
this
is
about
all
i
have
thought
said
or
done
or
felt
a
stagnant
day
home
with
a
bad
influenza
cold
in
a
deplorable
condition
the
best
i
could
do
was
to
sit
by
the
fire
and
read
newspapers
one
by
one
from
the
first
page
to
the
last
till
the
reading
became
mechanical
i
found
myself
reading
an
account
of
the
lincoln
handicap
and
a
column
article
on
kleptomania
while
advertisements
of
new
books
were
devoured
with
relish
as
delicacies
my
mind
became
a
morass
of
current
divorce
court
news
society
gossip
if
sir
goes
romeward
if
miss
sings
true
and
advertisements
i
went
on
reading
because
i
was
afraid
to
be
alone
with
myself
b
arrived
at
tea
and
after
saying
he
felt
very
swallowed
a
glass
of
bols
gin
the
gin
of
antony
bols
and
recovered
sufficiently
to
inform
me
delightedly
that
he
had
just
won
he
told
me
all
the
story
meanwhile
i
tired
of
wiping
and
blowing
my
nose
sat
in
the
dirty
armchair
hunched
up
with
elbows
on
knees
and
let
it
drip
on
to
the
dirty
carpet
b
of
course
noticed
nothing
which
was
fortunate
some
kinds
of
damned
fool
would
have
been
kindly
and
sympathetic
i
must
say
i
like
old
b
i
like
him
for
his
simpleness
and
utter
absence
of
which
make
him
as
charming
as
a
child
moreover
he
often
makes
me
a
present
of
invaluable
turf
tips
of
course
he
is
a
liar
but
his
lies
are
harmless
and
on
his
mouth
like
milk
on
an
infant
my
own
lies
are
much
more
dangerous
and
when
you
are
ill
to
be
treated
as
tho
you
were
well
is
good
for
hypochondriacs
h
wedding
five
minutes
before
time
i
am
told
i
made
a
dramatic
entry
into
the
church
clad
in
an
audaciously
light
pair
of
cashmere
trousers
gloves
with
top
hat
and
cane
the
latter
upset
the
respectability
frightfully
it
is
not
il
if
i
am
to
admit
the
facts
they
are
that
i
eagerly
anticipate
love
look
everywhere
for
it
long
for
it
am
unhappy
without
it
she
fascinates
me
admitted
i
could
if
i
would
surrender
myself
her
affection
makes
me
long
to
do
it
i
am
sick
of
living
by
myself
i
am
frightened
of
myself
my
life
is
miserable
alone
and
sometimes
desperately
miserable
when
i
long
for
a
little
sympathy
to
be
close
at
hand
i
have
often
tried
to
persuade
r
to
share
a
flat
with
me
because
i
do
really
wish
to
marry
i
struggle
against
the
idea
i
am
egotist
enough
to
wish
to
shirk
the
responsibilities
but
then
i
am
a
ridiculously
romantic
creature
with
a
wonderful
ideal
of
a
woman
i
shall
never
meet
or
if
i
do
she
wo
want
me
that
wholly
impossible
she
r
in
a
flat
with
me
would
partly
solve
my
difficulties
i
do
love
her
enough
for
marriage
mine
must
be
a
grand
passion
a
for
i
am
capable
of
it
humble
the
hon
son
and
heir
of
lord
invited
me
to
lunch
with
him
in
square
he
a
handsome
youth
of
with
fair
hair
and
blue
eyes
and
o
such
an
aristocrat
good
lord
but
to
continue
the
receipt
of
so
unexpected
an
invitation
from
so
glorious
a
young
gentleman
at
first
gave
me
palpitation
of
the
heart
i
was
so
surprised
that
i
scarcely
had
enough
presence
of
mind
to
listen
to
the
rest
of
his
remarks
and
later
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
i
could
recall
the
place
where
we
arranged
to
meet
his
remarks
too
are
not
easy
to
follow
as
he
talks
in
a
stenographic
manner
jerking
out
disjected
members
of
sentences
and
leaving
you
to
make
the
best
of
them
or
else
to
hell
with
you
by
the
lord
i
speak
english
do
i
if
i
said
i
beg
your
pardon
he
jerked
again
and
left
me
often
equally
unenlightened
on
arriving
at
his
home
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
shout
down
the
stairs
to
the
basement
elsie
elsie
while
i
gazed
with
awe
at
a
parcel
on
the
hall
table
addressed
to
lord
before
lunch
we
sat
in
his
little
room
and
talked
about
but
i
was
still
quite
unable
to
regain
my
i
could
for
the
life
of
me
forget
that
here
was
i
lunching
with
lord
son
on
equal
terms
with
mutual
interests
that
his
sisters
perhaps
would
come
in
directly
or
even
the
noble
lord
himself
i
felt
like
a
scared
hare
how
should
i
address
a
peer
of
the
realm
i
kept
trying
to
remember
and
every
now
and
then
for
some
unaccountable
reason
my
mind
travelled
into
shire
and
i
saw
auntie
c
serving
out
tea
and
sugar
over
the
counter
of
the
shop
in
the
little
village
i
luxuriated
in
the
contrast
tho
i
am
not
at
all
inclined
to
be
a
snob
he
next
offered
me
a
cigarette
which
i
took
and
lit
it
was
a
turkish
cigarette
with
one
end
plugged
up
with
to
absorb
the
nicotine
a
thing
i
never
seen
before
i
was
so
flurried
at
the
time
that
i
did
not
notice
this
and
lit
the
wrong
end
with
perfect
ease
and
the
honourable
one
pointed
out
my
error
to
me
and
told
me
to
throw
the
cigarette
away
and
have
another
by
this
time
i
had
completely
lost
my
nerve
my
pride
chagrin
excessive
were
entangling
all
my
movements
in
the
meshes
of
a
net
failing
to
tumble
to
the
situation
i
inquired
why
the
end
is
there
a
right
and
a
wrong
end
lord
son
and
heir
pointed
out
the
end
now
blackened
by
my
match
that
did
burn
very
well
did
it
i
was
bound
to
confess
that
it
did
not
and
threw
the
smoke
away
under
the
impression
that
these
wonderful
cigarettes
with
right
and
wrong
ends
must
be
some
special
brand
sold
only
to
aristocrats
and
at
a
great
price
and
possessing
some
secret
virtue
once
again
handsome
drew
out
his
silver
selected
a
second
cigarette
for
me
and
held
it
towards
me
between
his
long
delicate
fingers
at
the
same
time
pointing
out
the
plug
at
one
end
and
making
a
few
staccato
remarks
which
i
could
not
catch
i
was
still
too
scared
to
be
in
full
possession
of
my
faculties
and
he
apparently
was
too
tired
to
be
explicit
to
a
member
of
the
bourgeoisie
stumbling
about
his
the
plug
only
suggested
to
me
some
sort
of
a
plot
on
the
part
of
a
dissolute
scion
of
a
noble
house
to
lure
me
into
one
of
his
bad
habits
such
as
smoking
opium
or
taking
veronal
i
again
prepared
to
light
the
cigarette
at
the
wrong
end
try
the
other
end
repeated
the
young
man
smiling
blandly
i
blushed
and
immediately
recovered
my
balance
and
even
related
my
knowledge
of
pipes
fitted
to
carry
similar
plugs
during
lunch
at
which
we
sat
alone
after
sundry
visits
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
shout
down
to
the
kitchen
he
announced
that
he
thought
it
was
last
night
affair
after
all
which
was
annoying
the
cook
he
got
home
late
without
a
it
was
because
he
called
her
cook
instead
of
austin
he
smiled
serenely
and
decided
to
indulge
his
indulgent
attitude
betraying
an
objectionable
satisfaction
with
the
security
of
his
own
unassailable
social
status
there
was
a
trace
of
gratification
at
the
little
compliment
secreted
in
the
cook
annoyance
she
wanted
charles
to
call
her
austin
forsooth
very
well
and
he
smiled
down
on
the
little
weakness
haute
en
i
enjoyed
this
little
experience
turning
it
over
in
my
mind
as
the
housemaid
says
when
she
decides
to
stay
on
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
social
parvenu
is
not
such
a
vulgar
fellow
after
all
he
may
be
a
bore
particularly
if
he
sits
with
his
finger
tips
apposed
over
a
spherical
paunch
festooned
with
a
gold
chain
and
keeps
on
relating
how
once
he
gummed
labels
on
blacking
bottles
often
enough
he
is
a
smug
fellow
yet
truth
to
tell
we
all
feel
a
little
interested
in
him
he
is
a
traveller
from
an
antique
land
and
we
sometimes
like
to
listen
to
his
tales
of
adventure
and
all
he
has
come
through
he
has
traversed
large
territories
of
human
experience
he
has
met
strange
folk
and
lodged
in
strange
caravanserai
similarly
with
the
man
who
has
come
down
in
the
world
the
fool
the
drunkard
the
embezzler
he
may
bore
us
with
his
maudlin
sympathy
with
himself
yet
his
stories
hold
us
it
must
be
a
fine
experience
within
the
limits
of
a
single
life
to
traverse
the
whole
keyboard
of
our
social
status
whether
up
or
down
i
should
like
to
be
a
peer
who
grinds
a
barrel
organ
or
better
still
a
who
now
lives
in
park
lane
it
must
be
very
dull
to
remain
stationary
once
a
peer
always
a
peer
miss
heard
me
sigh
and
asked
what
it
might
mean
only
the
sparks
flying
upward
i
answered
lugubriously
a
blackguard
is
often
unconscious
of
a
good
deal
of
his
wickedness
charge
him
with
wickedness
and
he
will
deny
it
quite
honestly
honest
then
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
his
life

inquired
of
a
fat
curate
who
was
occupying
more
than
his
fair
share
of
a
seat
on

of

you

your
pardon

the

repeated
his
inquiry
with
more
emphasis
in
the
hideous
scotch
brogue
i
suppose
i
shall
stay
here
till
i

presently
i

what

asked
the

in
falsetto
indignation

grunted
and
shunted
sideways
so
that
the
poor
fellow
almost
slid
on
to
the
floor
a
posse
of
police
walking
along
in

file
always
makes
me
laugh
a
single
constable
is
a
policeman
but
several
in
single
file
are
coppers
i
imagine
every
one
laughs
at
them
and
i
have
a
shrewd
suspicion
it
is
one
of
gilbert
legacies
the
of
having
become
part
of
the
national
consciousness
lighting
chloe
r
remarked
that
he
intended
writing
a

on

ah
i
said
at
once
appreciative
now
tell
me
do
you
balance
your
hand
by
gently
ever
so
gently
resting
the
extreme
tip
of
your
little
finger
upon
her
chin
and
i
was
warming
up
do
you
hold
the
match
vertically
or
horizontally
and
do
you
light
it
in
the
dark
or
in
the
light
if
you
have
finesse
you
wo
need
to
be
told
that
the
thing
is
to
get
a
steady
flame
and
the
maximum
of
illumination
upon

face
to

over
a
period
for
as
long
as
possible
chloe

a

with
a
charming
opening
in

her

asked
my
mother
last
night
tentatively
do
you
like
chloe
blouse
is
it
too
low
my
mother
scrutinised
the
dear
little
furry
thing
and
answered
doubtfully
maria
i
do
think
so
how
ridiculous
why
the
v
is
a
positive
signpost
my
dear
fellow
i
said
to
r
i
should
refuse
to
be
bluffed
by
those
old
women
tell
them
you
carlyle
called
lamb
a
despicable
abortion
what
a
crime
developed
a
savage
fit
up
to
a
certain
point
perhaps
but
beyond
that
anxiety
changes
into
recklessness
you
simply
do
care
the
aperients
are
causing
dyspepsia
and
intermittent
action
of
the
heart
which
frightens
me
after
a
terrifying
week
during
which
at
crises
i
have
felt
like
dropping
suddenly
in
the
street
in
the
gardens
anywhere
from
syncope
i
rebelled
against
this
humiliating
fear
i
pulled
my
shoulders
back
and
walked
briskly
ahead
along
the
street
with
a
dropped
beat
every
two
or
three
steps
i
laughed
bitterly
at
it
and
felt
it
could
stop
or
go
on
i
was
at
last
indifferent
in
a
photographer
shop
was
the
picture
of
a
very
beautiful
woman
and
i
stopped
to
look
at
her
i
glowered
in
thro
the
glass
angrily
and
reflected
how
she
was
gazing
out
with
that
same
expression
even
at
the
butcher
boy
or
the
it
embittered
me
to
think
of
having
to
leave
her
to
some
other
man
to
me
she
represented
all
the
joy
of
life
which
at
any
moment
i
might
have
had
to
quit
for
ever
such
impotence
enraged
me
and
i
walked
off
up
the
street
with
a
whirling
heart
and
the
thought
i
shall
drop
i
suppose
when
i
get
up
as
far
as
that
yet
do
think
i
was
alarmed
oh
no
the
iron
had
entered
me
and
i
went
on
with
cynical
indifference
waiting
to
be
struck
down
she
is
a
very
great
deal
to
me
perhaps
i
love
her
very
much
after
all
bad
heart
attack
all
day
intermittency
is
very
refined
torture
to
one
who
wants
to
live
very
badly
your
pump
goes
a
dot
and
carry
one
or
say
misses
a
stitch
what
time
you
breathe
deep
begin
to
shake
your
friend
hand
and
make
a
farewell
speech
then
it
goes
on
again
and
you
order
another
pint
of
beer
it
is
a
fractious
animal
within
the
cage
of
my
thorax
and
i
never
know
when
it
is
going
to
escape
and
make
off
with
my
precious
life
between
its
teeth
i
humour
and
coax
and
soothe
it
but
god
wot
i
have
much
confidence
in
the
little
beast
my
thorax
it
appears
is
an
intolerable
kennel
in
a
very
cheerful
mood
pleased
with
myself
and
everybody
till
a
seagull
soared
overhead
in
kensington
gardens
and
aroused
my
vast
capacities
for
envy
i
wish
i
could
fly
in
l
with
my
brother
a
the
great
man
is
in
great
form
and
very
happy
in
his
love
for
n
he
is
a
most
delightful
creature
and
i
love
him
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
wide
world
there
is
an
almost
feminine
tenderness
in
my
love
we
spent
a
delightful
day
talking
and
arguing
and
insulting
one
another
at
these
seances
we
take
delight
in
anaesthetising
our
hearts
for
the
purposes
of
argument
and
a
third
person
would
be
bound
to
suppose
we
were
in
the
throes
of
a
bitter
quarrel
we
pile
up
one
vindictive
remark
on
another
ingeniously
seeking
out
and
with
malice
weak
points
in
each
other
armour
which
previous
exchange
of
confidences
makes
it
easy
to
find
neither
of
us
hesitates
to
make
use
of
such
private
confessions
yet
our
love
is
so
strong
that
we
can
afford
to
take
any
liberty
there
is
in
fact
a
fearful
joy
in
testing
the
strength
of
our
affection
by
searching
for
cutting
rejoinders
to
see
the
effect
we
rig
up
one
another
cherished
ideals
like
aunt
sallies
and
then
knock
them
down
we
wax
sarcastic
satirical
contemptuous
in
turn
we
wave
our
hands
animatedly
is
a
great
trick
with
both
of
us
get
flushed
point
with
our
fingers
and
thump
the
table
to
clinch
some
bit
of
repartee
yet
it
all
smoke
our
love
is
unassailable
it
like
the
law
of
gravitation
you
can
not
dispute
it
it
underlies
our
existence
it
is
the
air
we
breathe
n
is
charming
and
thought
we
were
quarrelling
and
therefore
intervened
on
his
side
r
outlined
an
impression
he
had
in
naples
one
day
during
a
sirocco
of
the
imminence
of
his
own
death
it
was
evidently
an
isolated
experience
and
bored
me
a
little
as
i
could
have
said
a
lot
myself
about
that
when
he
finished
i
drew
from
my
pocket
an
envelope
with
my
name
and
three
addresses
scribbled
on
it
to
help
the
police
in
case
of
syncope
as
i
explained
i
have
carried
this
with
me
for
several
years
and
at
one
time
a
flask
of
brandy
went
to
see
the
irish
players
in
sitting
in
front
of
me
was
a
charming
little
irish
girl
accompanied
by
a
male
clod
with
eyes
like
a
a
sandy
bristly
moustache
like
a
housemaid
broom
and
a
face
like
a
gluteal
mass
and
a
horrid
voice
that
crepitated
rather
than
spoke
she
was
dark
with
shining
blue
eyes
and
a
delightful
little
nose
of
the
utmost
import
to
every
male
who
should
gaze
upon
her
between
the
acts
the
clod
hearkened
to
her
vivacious
conversation
like
an
enchanted
bullock
her
vivacity
was
such
that
the
tip
of
her
nose
moved
up
and
down
for
emphasis
and
by
the
end
of
the
third
act
i
was
captured
entirely
lucky
dog
that
clod
after
the
play
this
little
irish
maiden
caught
my
eye
and
it
became
a
physical
impossibility
for
me
to
check
a
smile
and
oh
heavens
she
gave
me
a
smile
in
return
precisely
five
seconds
later
she
looked
again
to
see
if
i
was
still
smiling
i
was
and
we
then
smiled
broadly
and
openly
on
one
another
her
smile
being
the
timorous
ingénue
not
the
glad
eye
of
a
de
later
on
the
railway
platform
whither
i
followed
her
i
caught
her
eye
again
was
ever
so
lucky
a
fellow
and
we
got
into
the
same
carriage
but
so
did
the
clod
ah
dear
was
ever
so
unlucky
a
fellow
forced
to
occupy
a
seat
some
way
off
but
she
caught
me
trying
to
see
her
thro
a
midnight
forest
of
opera
hats
lace
ruffles
projecting
ears
and
fat
noses
curse
left
her
at
high
street
station
and
probably
will
never
see
her
again
this
is
a
second
great
opportunity
the
first
was
the
girl
on
lundy
island
these
two
women
i
shall
always
regret
there
must
be
so
many
delightful
and
interesting
persons
in
london
if
only
i
could
get
at
them
rushed
off
to
tell
r
about
my
little
irish
girl
her
face
has
been
shadowing
me
all
day
a
violent
argument
with
r
marriage
he
says
love
means
appropriation
and
is
taking
the
most
elaborate
precautions
to
forfend
passion
just
as
if
it
were
a
militant
suffragette
every
woman
he
meets
he
first
puts
into
a
long
quarantine
lest
perchance
she
carries
the
germ
of
the
infectious
disease
he
quotes
hippolytus
and
talks
like
a
mediæval
ascetic
himself
i
imagine
he
regards
as
a
valuable
but
brittle
piece
of
dresden
china
which
must
be
saved
from
rough
handling
and
left
unmolested
to
pursue
its
high
and
dusty
destiny
an
old
crock
as
i
warned
him
by
refusing
to
plunge
into
life
he
will
live
long
and
be
a
well
preserved
man
but
scarcely
a
living
man
a
mummy
rather
i
told
him
so
amid
much
laughter
you
a
reactionary
says
he
yes
but
why
should
a
reactionary
be
a
naughty
boy
my
ironical
fate
lured
me
this
evening
into
another
discussion
on
marriage
in
which
i
had
to
take
up
a
position
exactly
opposite
to
the
one
i
defended
yesterday
against
r
in
fact
i
actually
subverted
to
my
own
pressing
requirements
some
of
r
own
arguments
the
argument
of
course
was
with
her
marriage
i
urged
was
an
economic
trap
for
guileless
young
men
and
for
my
part
to
give
myself
some
necessary
stiffening
i
did
not
intend
to
enter
upon
any
such
hazardous
course
even
if
i
had
the
chance
miss
miss
said
i
was
a
funk
to
me
who
the
day
before
had
been
hammering
into
r
my
principle
of
plunge
and
damn
the
consequences
i
was
informed
i
was
an
old
woman
afraid
to
go
out
without
an
umbrella
an
old
tabby
cat
afraid
to
leave
the
kitchen
fire
etc
yes
i
afraid
to
go
out
without
an
umbrella
i
argued
formally
when
it
raining
cats
and
dogs
as
long
as
i
am
dry
i
shall
keep
dry
as
soon
as
i
find
myself
caught
in
the
rain
or
victimised
by
a
passion
i
sha
be
afraid
of
falling
in
love
or
getting
wet
it
would
be
a
misadventure
but
i
am
not
going
in
search
of
one
all
the
same
the
discussion
was
very
galling
for
i
was
acting
a
part
the
truth
is
i
have
philandered
abominably
with
her
i
know
it
and
now
i
am
jibbing
at
the
idea
of
marriage
i
am
such
an
egotist
i
want
i
believe
a
princess
of
the
blood
royal
some
days
ago
sent
a
personal
advertisement
to
the
newspaper
to
try
to
find
my
little
irish
girl
who
lives
at
notting
hill
gate
they
return
me
the
money
and
advert
no
doubt
mistaking
me
for
a
white
slave
trafficker
and
by
this
time
i
thinking
my
little
irish
girl
can
go
to
blazes
shall
spend
the
on
sweets
or
monkey
nuts
it
is
raining
heavily
i
have
just
finished
dinner
in
the
street
an
itinerant
musician
is
singing
dolefully
o
rest
in
the
lord
in
my
dirty
little
sitting
room
i
begin
to
feel
very
restless
so
put
on
my
hat
and
cloak
and
walk
down
towards
the
station
for
a
paper
to
read
it
is
all
very
dark
and
dismal
and
i
gaze
with
hungry
eyes
in
thro
some
of
the
windows
disclosing
happy
comfortable
interiors
at
intervals
thunder
growls
and
lightning
brightens
up
the
deserted
dirtiness
of
the
station
waiting
room
a
few
bits
of
desolate
paper
lie
about
on
the
floor
and
up
in
one
corner
on
a
form
a
motionless
and
abject
driven
in
from
his
pitch
by
the
rain
his
hands
are
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
the
poor
devil
lies
with
legs
sprawling
out
and
eyes
closed
over
the
lower
part
of
his
face
he
wears
a
black
mask
to
hide
the
ravages
of
lupus
he
seemed
the
last
man
on
earth
after
every
one
else
had
died
of
the
plague
not
a
soul
in
the
station
not
a
train
and
this
is
june
spent
the
day
measuring
the
legs
and
antennæ
of
lice
to
two
places
of
decimals
to
the
lay
mind
how
fantastic
this
must
seem
indeed
i
hope
it
is
fantastic
i
do
not
mind
being
thought
odd
it
seems
almost
fitting
that
an
incurable
dilettante
like
myself
should
earn
his
livelihood
by
measuring
the
legs
of
lice
i
like
to
believe
that
such
a
bizarre
manner
of
life
suits
my
incurable
frivolousness
i
am
a
magpie
in
a
bagdad
bazaar
hopping
about
useless
inquisitive
fascinated
by
a
lot
of
astonishing
things
a
book
on
the
quadrature
of
the
circle
the
passage
in
burton
of
names
like
portwine
or
hogsflesh
tweezer
alley
or
pickle
herring
street
the
excellent
conceitful
sonnets
of
henry
constable
or
petticoat
lane
on
a
sunday
morning
colossal
things
such
as
art
science
frighten
me
i
am
afraid
i
should
develop
a
thirst
that
would
make
me
wish
to
drink
the
sea
dry
my
mind
is
a
disordered
miscellany
the
world
is
too
distracting
i
can
not
apply
myself
for
long
london
bewilders
me
at
times
it
is
a
phantasmagoria
an
opium
dream
out
of
de
quincey
geo
saintsbury
book
on
elizabethan
literature
amuses
me
there
can
be
no
doubt
is
a
very
refined
cultivated
fellow
i
bet
he
do
eat
periwinkles
with
a
pin
or
bite
his
nails
and
you
should
hear
him
refer
to
folk
who
ca
read
homer
in
the
original
or
who
have
been
to
oxford
to
merton
above
all
he
also
says
so
for
ne
sais
i
placed
the
volume
on
the
mantelpiece
as
if
it
were
a
bottle
of
physic
straight
from
my
dispensary
and
i
began
to
expostulate
and
expound
as
if
she
were
a
sick
person
and
i
the
doctor
she
seemed
a
little
nettled
at
my
proselytising
demeanour
and
gave
herself
out
to
be
very
preoccupied
or
at
any
rate
quite
uninterested
in
my
physic
i
read
the
book
last
night
at
one
sitting
and
was
boiling
over
with
it
i
fear
i
have
come
at
an
inconvenient
time
i
said
with
a
sardonic
smile
and
strummed
on
the
piano
i
must
really
be
off
please
read
it
which
sounded
like
times
a
day
after
meals
and
tell
me
how
you
like
it
facetiously
of
course
do
give
up
your
present
manual
for
it
that
would
be
foolish
and
unnecessary
i
rambled
on
disposed
to
be
very
playful
at
last
calmly
and
horribly
in
a
thoughtful
voice
she
answered
i
think
you
are
very
rude
you
play
the
piano
after
i
asked
you
to
stop
and
walk
about
just
as
if
it
were
your
own
home
i
remained
outwardly
calm
but
inwardly
was
very
surprised
and
full
of
tremors
i
said
after
a
pause
very
well
if
you
think
so
no
answer
and
i
was
too
proud
to
apologise
i
repeated
she
went
on
reading
her
novel
in
silence
while
i
got
as
far
as
the
door
very
upset
no
answer
oh
said
i
and
went
out
of
the
room
leaving
my
lady
for
good
and
all
and
i
not
sorry
in
the
passage
met
miss
what
she
said
going
already
farewell
i
said
sepulchrally
a
very
tragic
farewell
which
left
her
wondering
the
albert
went
with
r
to
the
albert
hall
to
the
of
memorial
concert
with
massed
bands
we
heard
the
symphonie
pathétique
funeral
march
trauermarsch
from
götterdammerung
the
ride
of
the
valkyries
and
a
solemn
melody
from
bach
this
afternoon
i
regard
as
a
mountain
peak
in
my
existence
for
two
solid
hours
i
sat
like
an
eagle
on
a
rock
gazing
into
infinity
a
very
fine
sensation
for
a
london
sparrow
i
have
an
idea
that
if
it
were
possible
to
assemble
the
sick
and
suffering
day
by
day
in
the
albert
hall
and
keep
the
orchestra
going
all
the
time
then
the
constant
exposure
of
sick
parts
to
such
heavenly
air
vibrations
would
ultimately
restore
to
them
the
lost
rhythm
of
health
surely
even
a
single
exposure
to
say
beethoven
fifth
symphony
must
result
in
some
permanent
reconstitution
of
ourselves
body
and
soul
no
one
can
be
quite
the
same
after
a
beethoven
symphony
has
streamed
him
if
one
could
a
human
soul
like
a
negative
the
effect
i
should
say
could
be
seen
i
tell
you
what
i
wish
they
do
seriously
divide
up
the
arena
into
a
series
of
cubicles
where
unobserved
and
in
perfect
privacy
a
man
could
execute
all
the
various
movements
of
his
body
and
limbs
which
the
music
prompts
it
would
be
such
a
delicious
and
it
torture
to
be
jammed
into
a
seat
where
you
ca
even
tap
one
foot
or
wave
an
arm
the
concert
restored
my
moral
health
i
came
away
in
love
with
people
i
was
hating
before
and
full
of
compassion
for
others
i
usually
condemn
a
feeling
of
immeasurable
well
being
a
jolly
bonhomie
enveloped
me
like
incandescent
light
at
the
close
when
we
stood
up
to
sing
the
national
anthem
we
all
felt
a
genuine
spirit
of
camaraderie
just
as
when
kings
die
we
were
silent
musing
upon
the
common
fate
and
when
the
time
came
to
separate
we
were
loath
to
go
our
several
ways
for
we
were
comrades
who
together
had
come
thro
a
great
experience
for
my
part
i
wanted
to
shake
hands
all
round
happy
travellers
now
alas
at
the
journey
end
and
never
perhaps
to
meet
again
never
r
and
i
walked
up
thro
kensington
gardens
like
two
young
gods
i
even
like
that
bloody
thing
i
said
pointing
to
the
albert
memorial
we
pointed
out
pretty
girls
to
one
another
watched
the
children
play
on
the
grass
we
laughed
exultingly
at
the
thought
of
our
dismal
colleagues
tho
i
said
as
before
i
loved
all
god
bless
even
old
r
said
it
was
nothing
short
of
insolence
on
their
part
to
have
neglected
the
opportunity
of
coming
to
the
concert
later
on
an
old
gaffer
up
from
the
country
stopped
us
to
ask
the
way
to
rotten
row
i
overwhelmed
him
with
directions
and
happy
descriptive
details
i
felt
like
walking
with
him
and
showing
him
what
a
wonderful
place
the
world
is
after
separating
from
r
very
reluctantly
it
was
horrible
to
be
left
alone
in
such
high
spirits
walked
up
towards
the
round
pond
and
caught
myself
avoiding
the
shadows
of
the
trees
so
as
to
be
every
moment
out
in
the
blazing
sun
i
scoffed
inwardly
at
the
timorousness
of
pale
anæmic
folk
whom
i
passed
hiding
in
the
shadows
of
the
elms
at
the
round
pond
came
across
a
bulldog
who
was
biting
out
great
chunks
of
water
and
in
luxuriant
letting
it
drool
out
again
from
each
corner
of
his
mouth
i
watched
this
old
fellow
greedily
it
was
very
hot
as
well
pleased
with
him
and
his
liquid
chops
as
with
anything
i
saw
unless
it
were
a
girl
and
a
man
lying
full
length
along
the
grass
and
kissing
beneath
a
sunshade
i
smiled
she
saw
me
and
smiled
too
in
return
and
then
fell
to
kissing
again
there
are
books
which
are
dinosaurs
sir
walter
raleigh
of
the
gibbon
and
fall
of
the
roman
there
are
men
who
are
dinosaurs
balzac
completing
his
human
comedy
napoleon
roosevelt
i
like
them
all
i
like
express
trains
and
motor
lorries
i
enjoy
watching
an
iron
girder
swinging
in
the
air
or
great
cubes
of
ice
caught
up
between
iron
pincers
i
must
always
stop
and
watch
these
things
i
like
everything
that
is
swift
or
immense
london
lightning
popocatepetl
i
enjoy
the
smell
of
tar
of
coal
of
fried
fish
or
a
brass
band
playing
a
liszt
rhapsody
and
why
should
those
foolish
mænads
shout
women
rights
just
because
they
burn
down
a
church
all
bonfires
are
delectable
civilisation
and
top
hats
bore
me
my
own
life
is
like
a
tame
rabbit
if
only
i
had
a
long
tail
to
lash
it
in
feline
rage
i
would
return
to
nature
i
could
almost
return
to
chaos
there
are
times
when
i
feel
so
dour
i
would
wreck
the
universe
if
i
could
i
think
after
three
years
of
armageddon
i
feel
quite
ready
to
go
back
to
top
hats
and
civilisation
in
kensington
the
instinct
for
worship
occurs
rhythmically
at
morning
and
evening
this
is
natural
for
twice
a
day
at
sunrise
and
sunset
however
we
may
be
however
hypnotised
by
daily
routine
our
natural
impulse
is
provided
we
are
awake
to
look
to
the
horizon
at
the
sun
and
stand
a
moment
with
mute
lips
during
the
course
of
the
day
or
night
we
are
too
occupied
or
asleep
but
sunrise
is
the
great
hour
of
the
departure
and
sunset
is
the
arrival
at
the
end
everything
puts
on
a
mysterious
appearance
the
tops
of
the
elms
seemed
high
and
pushing
up
into
the
sky
had
secret
communion
with
the
clouds
the
clouds
seemed
waiting
for
a
ceremony
a
way
had
been
prepared
by
the
tapissier
a
moment
of
suspense
while
one
cloud
stretched
to
another
like
courtiers
in
whispered
conversation
a
rumour
of
the
approach
then
slowly
the
news
came
thro
that
the
sun
had
arrived
for
immediate
departure
have
finished
my
essay
but
am
written
out
obviously
i
struggled
with
another
and
spent
two
hours
sucking
the
end
of
my
pen
but
after
painfully
mountainous
parturition
all
i
brought
forth
were
the
two
ridiculous
mice
of
one
meretricious
trope
and
one
grammatical
solecism
i
can
sometimes
sit
before
a
sheet
of
paper
pen
in
hand
unable
to
produce
a
word
for
a
walk
with
r
in
the
country
calling
for
tea
at
his
house
at
played
clock
golf
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
miss
a
tall
statuesque
lady
with
golden
hair
as
graceful
as
an
antelope
and
very
comely
her
two
dear
little
feet
clad
in
white
shoes
peeping
out
as
r
said
like
two
white
mice
one
after
the
other
as
she
moved
across
the
lawn
coming
home
i
said
to
r
histrionically
some
little
boy
will
some
day
rest
his
head
upon
her
bosom
beautiful
in
line
and
depth
all
unconscious
of
his
luck
or
of
his
part
in
a
beautiful
picture
would
that
i
were
the
father
to
make
that
group
a
r
with
meticulous
accuracy
always
refers
to
her
as
that
elegant
virgin
while
sketching
under
hammersmith
bridge
yesterday
r
heard
a
whistle
and
looking
up
saw
a
charming
young
thing
leaning
over
the
bridge
parapet
smiling
like
the
blessed
damozel
out
of
heaven
come
down
he
cried
she
did
and
they
discussed
pictures
while
he
painted
later
he
walked
with
her
to
the
broadway
saw
her
into
a
and
said
without
so
much
as
an
exchange
of
names
even
if
she
a
whore
i
said
it
a
pity
your
curiosity
was
so
sluggish
you
should
have
seen
her
home
even
if
you
did
not
go
home
with
her
young
man
you
preferred
to
let
go
of
authentic
life
at
hammersmith
broadway
so
as
to
return
at
once
to
your
precious
painting
perhaps
replied
he
enigmatically
whatever
you
do
if
ever
you
meet
her
again
i
rejoined
introduce
her
to
that
abominable
he
is
abominably
handsome
and
i
hate
him
for
it
to
all
his
other
distinctions
he
is
welcome
parentage
money
success
but
i
can
never
forgive
him
his
good
looks
and
the
inevitable
marriage
to
some
beautiful
woman
reflectively
up
to
now
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
envy
as
a
did
not
exist
have
you
none
not
much
he
answered
and
i
believe
it
smug
wretch
then
all
i
can
say
is
i
may
have
instincts
and
passions
but
i
am
not
a
pale
artist
what
the
matter
with
you
i
foamed
is
that
you
like
pictures
if
i
showed
you
a
real
woman
you
would
exclaim
contemplatively
lovely
then
putting
out
one
hand
to
touch
her
unsuspectingly
you
scream
aghast
it
alive
i
hear
it
ticking
my
boy
i
answer
severely
with
a
flourish
is
a
woman
heart
r
exploded
with
laughter
and
then
said
a
truce
to
your
desire
for
more
life
for
actual
men
and
women
i
know
this
that
last
night
i
would
not
have
exchanged
the
quiet
armchair
reading
the
last
chapter
of
dostoieffsky
for
a
balaclava
charge
a
matter
of
temperament
i
suppose
i
reflected
in
cold
detachment
you
see
i
belong
to
the
raw
meat
school
prefer
life
cooked
for
you
in
a
book
you
prefer
the
confectioner
shop
to
cutting
down
the
wheat
with
your
own
scythe
the
is
a
ghastly
hole
they
will
give
me
none
of
the
apparatus
i
require
if
you
ask
the
trustees
for
a
thousand
pounds
for
the
propagation
of
the
gospel
in
foreign
parts
they
say
yes
if
you
ask
for
twenty
pounds
for
a
new
microscope
they
say
no
but
we
cut
off
your
nose
with
a
big
pair
of
scissors
to
a
pedantic
prosy
little
old
maid
who
was
working
in
my
room
this
morning
i
exclaimed
i
sooner
make
a
good
dissection
than
go
to
a
lord
mayor
banquet
turtle
soup
ai
in
it
she
was
uninspired
and
said
oom
and
went
on
pinning
insects
then
more
brightly
and
with
great
punctilio
in
the
pronunciation
of
her
words
having
cleared
her
throat
and
drawn
herself
up
with
great
deliberation
to
deliver
herself
of
a
remark
she
volunteered
i
whish
i
had
nevah
taken
up
such
a
brittle
grooop
as
the
stones
stoneflies
one
dare
not
loook
at
a
stone
poor
dear
little
old
maid
this
was
my
turn
to
say
oom
pretty
dismal
work
i
added
ambiguously
then
with
malice
aforethought
i
whistled
a
harry
lauder
tune
asked
her
if
she
had
ever
heard
willie
solar
sing
you
made
me
love
you
and
then
and
in
succession
inquired
what
become
of
all
the
gold
what
become
of
waring
what
shall
i
sing
when
all
is
sung
to
which
several
categorical
interrogations
she
ventured
no
reply
but
presently
in
the
usual
voice
i
have
placed
an
agrionine
in
this
drawer
for
security
and
now
i
want
it
can
not
find
it
life
is
like
that
i
said
i
never
can
find
my
agrionines
all
europe
is
mobilising
will
england
join
in
we
all
await
the
result
of
a
battle
between
two
millions
of
men
the
tension
makes
me
feel
physically
sick
in
bed
with
a
fever
i
never
visit
the
flat
now
but
her
mother
kindly
came
over
to
see
me
living
now
in
rooms
alone
i
have
since
my
return
from
cornwall
placed
all
my
journals
in
a
specially
made
cabinet
r
came
to
dinner
and
after
a
glass
or
so
of
beaune
and
a
cigarette
i
open
my
coffin
it
is
a
long
box
with
a
brass
handle
at
each
end
and
with
some
show
of
deliberation
select
a
volume
to
read
to
him
drawing
it
from
its
division
with
lavish
punctiliousness
and
inquiring
with
an
oily
voice
a
little
of
as
if
we
were
trying
wines
r
grins
at
the
little
farce
and
so
encourages
me
doctor
consulting
rooms
my
life
has
been
spent
in
them
medical
specialists
harley
street
men
i
have
seen
four
and
all
to
no
purpose
m
wrote
me
the
other
day
come
along
and
see
me
on
tuesday
some
day
i
dare
say
we
shall
find
something
we
can
patch
he
regards
me
with
the
most
obvious
commiseration
and
always
when
i
come
away
after
a
visit
he
shakes
me
warmly
by
the
hand
and
says
old
man
and
good
luck
more
luck
than
the
pharmacopœia
my
life
has
always
been
a
continuous
struggle
with
and
ambition
and
i
have
mastered
neither
i
try
to
reassure
myself
that
this
accursed
will
not
affect
my
career
i
keep
flogging
my
will
in
the
hope
of
winning
thro
in
the
end
yet
at
the
back
of
my
mind
there
is
the
great
improbability
that
i
shall
ever
live
long
enough
to
realise
myself
for
a
long
time
past
my
hope
has
simply
been
to
last
long
enough
to
convince
others
of
what
i
might
have
done
had
i
lived
that
will
be
something
but
even
to
do
that
i
will
not
allow
that
i
have
overmuch
time
i
have
never
at
any
time
lived
with
any
sense
of
security
i
have
never
felt
permanently
settled
in
this
life
nothing
more
than
a
shadowy
a
wraith
a
festoon
of
mist
likely
to
disappear
any
moment
at
times
when
i
am
vividly
conscious
of
the
insecurity
of
my
tenure
here
my
desires
enter
on
a
mad
race
to
obtain
fulfilment
before
it
is
too
late
and
as
fulfilment
recedes
ambition
obsesses
me
the
more
i
am
daily
occupied
in
calculating
with
my
trying
to
circumvent
it
to
carry
on
in
spite
of
all
i
conquer
each
day
every
week
is
a
victory
i
am
always
surprised
that
my
health
or
will
has
not
collapsed
that
by
jove
i
am
still
working
and
still
living
one
day
it
looks
like
appendicitis
another
stoppage
another
threatened
blindness
or
i
develop
a
cough
and
am
menaced
with
consumption
so
i
go
on
in
a
hurricane
of
bad
dreams
i
struggle
like
laocoon
with
the
serpents
the
serpents
of
nervous
depression
that
press
around
the
heart
tighter
than
i
care
to
admit
i
must
use
every
kind
of
blandishment
to
convince
myself
that
my
life
and
my
work
are
worth
while
frequently
i
must
smother
and
kill
and
it
calls
for
prompt
action
the
shrill
voice
that
cries
from
the
tiniest
corner
of
my
heart
are
you
quite
sure
you
are
such
an
important
fellow
as
you
imagine
or
i
fret
over
the
condition
of
my
brain
finding
that
i
forget
what
i
read
i
lose
in
acuteness
of
my
perceptions
my
brain
is
a
tumefaction
but
i
wo
give
in
i
go
on
trying
to
recollect
what
i
have
forgotten
i
harry
my
brain
all
day
to
recall
a
word
or
name
i
attack
other
folk
importunately
i
write
things
down
so
as
to
look
them
up
in
reference
books
i
am
always
looking
up
the
things
i
remember
i
have
forgotten
there
is
another
struggle
too
that
often
engrosses
all
my
energies
it
is
a
horrible
thing
that
with
so
large
an
ambition
so
great
a
love
of
life
i
should
nevertheless
court
disaster
like
this
truly
sir
thomas
browne
you
say
every
man
is
his
own
atropos
in
short
i
lead
an
unfathomably
miserable
existence
in
this
dark
gray
street
in
these
drab
dirty
rooms
miserable
in
its
emptiness
of
home
love
human
society
now
that
i
never
visit
the
flat
i
visit
about
two
houses
in
london
the
doctor
and
r
hotel
i
walk
along
the
streets
and
stare
in
the
windows
of
private
houses
hungry
for
a
little
society
it
creates
in
me
a
gnawing
rancorous
discontent
to
be
seeing
people
everywhere
in
london
millions
of
them
and
then
to
realise
my
own
ridiculously
circumscribed
knowledge
of
them
i
am
passionately
eager
to
have
acquaintances
to
possess
at
least
a
few
friends
if
i
die
how
many
persons
shall
i
have
talked
to
or
how
many
men
and
women
shall
i
have
known
a
few
maiden
aunts
and
one
or
two
old
fossils
i
am
burning
to
meet
real
live
men
i
have
masses
of
mental
stuff
i
am
anxious
to
unload
but
i
am
ignorant
of
people
as
of
countries
and
live
in
celestial
isolation
this
i
fear
reads
like
a
wail
of
but
i
am
trying
to
give
myself
the
pleasure
of
describing
myself
at
this
period
truthfully
to
make
a
bid
at
least
for
some
posthumous
sympathy
therefore
it
shall
be
told
that
i
who
am
capable
of
passionate
love
am
sexually
starved
and
endure
the
pangs
of
a
fiendish
solitude
in
rooms
with
an
ugly
landlady
face
when
i
despair
of
ever
finding
a
woman
to
i
never
meet
women
of
my
own
class
and
am
unprepossessing
in
appearance
and
yet
i
fancy
that
once
my
reserve
is
melted
i
am
not
without
attractions
he
grows
on
you
a
girl
said
of
me
once
but
i
am
hypercritical
and
hyperfastidious
i
want
too
much
i
search
daily
in
the
streets
with
a
starved
and
hungry
look
what
a
horrible
and
powerful
and
hateful
thing
this
love
instinct
is
i
hate
it
hate
it
hate
it
it
will
not
let
me
rest
i
wish
i
were
a
eunuch
there
a
beautiful
young
thing
r
and
i
say
to
one
another
sardonically
hoping
thereby
to
conceal
the
canker
within
i
could
gnash
my
teeth
and
weep
in
anger
baulked
frustrated
as
i
am
at
almost
every
turn
of
life
in
my
profession
in
my
literary
efforts
and
in
my
love
of
man
and
woman
kind
i
would
utter
a
whole
commination
service
in
my
present
state
of
mind
to
me
woman
is
wonderful
fact
of
existence
if
there
be
any
next
world
and
it
be
as
i
hope
it
is
a
jolly
gossiping
place
with
people
standing
around
the
mantelpiece
and
discussing
their
earthly
experiences
i
shall
thump
my
fist
on
the
table
as
my
friends
turn
to
me
on
entering
and
exclaim
in
a
loud
voice
woman
since
i
grew
up
i
have
wept
three
times
the
first
time
they
were
tears
of
exasperation
dad
and
i
were
sitting
down
side
by
side
after
a
wordy
combat
in
which
he
had
remained
adamant
and
i
was
forced
both
by
conscience
and
argument
to
give
in
to
relinquish
my
dissections
and
go
off
to
some
inquest
on
a
drowning
fatality
the
second
time
was
when
mother
died
and
the
third
was
but
i
am
calm
now
they
were
tears
of
remorse
on
occasion
bald
confession
in
this
journal
is
sweet
for
the
soul
and
strengthens
it
it
gives
me
a
kind
of
false
backbone
to
communicate
my
secrets
for
i
am
determined
that
some
day
some
one
shall
know
if
god
really
intervenes
in
our
affairs
here
is
an
opportunity
let
him
save
me
i
challenge
him
to
save
me
from
perishing
in
this
ditch
it
is
not
often
i
am
cornered
into
praying
but
i
did
this
morning
for
i
feel
defeated
this
day
and
almost
inarticulate
in
my
misery
nietzsche
in
a
newspaper
i
read
for
myself
i
have
felt
exceptionally
blest
having
hell
phantoms
inside
me
to
thrust
at
in
the
dark
internal
enemies
to
dominate
till
i
felt
myself
an
ecstatic
victor
wrenching
at
last
good
triumphant
joys
thro
the
bars
of
my
own
sickness
and
weakness
joys
with
which
your
notions
of
happiness
poor
sleek
smug
creatures
can
not
compare
you
must
carry
a
chaos
inside
you
to
give
birth
to
a
dancing
star
but
nietzsche
is
no
consolation
to
a
man
who
has
once
been
weak
enough
to
be
brought
to
his
knees
there
i
am
and
there
i
think
i
have
prayed
a
little
somehow
but
it
all
in
desperation
not
in
faith
internal
chaos
i
have
but
no
dancing
star
dancing
stars
are
the
consolation
of
genius
am
better
my
better
self
is
convinced
that
it
is
silly
and
to
think
so
much
about
my
own
puny
destiny
especially
at
times
like
these
when
god
love
us
all
there
is
a
column
of
casualties
each
day
the
great
thing
to
be
thankful
for
is
that
i
am
and
alive
that
i
was
alive
and
even
may
be
surely
that
is
thrilling
enough
what
then
have
i
to
complain
of
a
lucky
dog
to
be
alive
at
all
my
plight
is
bad
but
there
are
others
in
a
worse
one
i
going
to
be
brave
and
fight
on
the
side
of
nietzsche
who
knows
but
that
one
day
the
dancing
star
may
yet
be
born
spent
the
evening
in
my
lodgings
struggling
with
my
will
too
flabby
to
work
disinclined
to
read
a
dreadful
vague
unrest
possessing
me
i
could
sit
still
in
my
chair
so
walked
around
the
table
continuously
like
a
squirrel
in
a
cage
i
wanted
to
be
going
out
somewhere
talking
to
some
one
to
be
among
human
beings
many
an
evening
during
the
past
few
months
i
have
got
up
and
gone
down
the
road
to
look
across
at
the
windows
of
the
flat
to
see
if
there
were
a
red
light
behind
the
curtains
and
if
so
wonder
if
she
were
there
and
how
she
was
my
pride
would
never
allow
me
to
visit
there
again
on
my
own
initiative
k
has
managed
to
bring
about
a
rapprochement
but
i
go
very
seldom
pride
again
i
wanted
to
do
so
i
thought
i
would
just
go
down
the
road
to
look
up
at
the
windows
that
seemed
to
be
some
comfort
why
do
i
wish
to
do
this
i
do
not
know
from
a
mere
inspection
one
would
say
that
i
am
in
love
but
remember
i
am
also
three
times
i
nearly
put
on
my
boots
and
went
down
to
have
a
look
up
what
ridiculous
weakness
yet
this
room
can
be
a
frightful
prison
shall
i
i
can
not
decide
i
see
her
figure
constantly
before
me
gentle
graceful
calm
stretching
forth
both
hands
and
to
me
seized
a
pack
of
cards
and
played
patience
and
went
on
playing
patience
because
i
was
afraid
to
stop
given
a
weak
constitution
a
great
ambition
an
amorous
nature
and
at
the
same
time
a
very
fastidious
one
i
might
have
known
i
was
in
for
trouble
some
time
ago
i
noticed
a
quotation
from
one
marie
bashkirtseff
in
a
book
on
strindberg
and
was
struck
with
the
likeness
to
a
sentiment
of
my
own
who
you
i
wondered
this
evening
went
to
the
library
and
read
about
her
in
mathilde
introductory
essay
to
her
journal
i
am
simply
astounded
it
would
be
difficult
in
all
the
world
history
to
discover
any
two
persons
with
temperaments
so
alike
she
is
the
very
spit
of
me
i
devoured
mathilde
blind
pages
more
and
more
astonished
we
are
identical
oh
marie
bashkirtseff
how
we
should
have
hated
one
another
she
feels
as
i
feel
we
have
the
same
the
same
vanity
and
corroding
ambition
she
is
impressionable
volatile
passionate
ill
so
am
i
her
journal
is
my
journal
all
mine
is
stale
reading
now
she
has
written
down
all
my
thoughts
and
forestalled
me
already
i
have
found
some
parallels
to
think
i
am
only
a
replica
how
humiliating
for
a
human
being
to
find
himself
merely
a
duplicate
of
another
is
there
anything
in
the
transmigration
of
souls
she
died
in
i
was
born
in
a
man
is
always
looking
at
himself
in
the
mirror
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
tie
his
tie
and
brush
his
hair
what
does
he
think
of
his
face
he
must
have
private
opinions
but
it
is
usually
considered
a
little
out
of
taste
to
entertain
opinions
about
one
personal
appearance
as
for
myself
some
mirrors
do
me
down
pretty
well
others
depress
me
i
am
bound
to
confess
i
am
biassed
in
favour
of
the
friendly
mirror
i
am
not
handsome
but
i
look
interesting
i
hope
distinguished
my
eyes
are
but
my
worst
moments
are
when
the
barber
combs
my
hair
right
down
over
my
forehead
or
when
i
see
a
really
handsome
man
in
hyde
park
such
occasions
direct
my
gaze
reflexly
and
doubt
like
a
thief
in
the
night
forces
the
back
door
m
sent
me
dancing
mad
by
suggesting
that
i
copied
r
in
my
manner
of
speech
and
opinions
now
r
has
a
damned
pervasive
way
of
conducting
himself
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
were
a
high
official
of
the
foreign
office
i
on
the
contrary
am
shy
easily
overlooked
and
this
makes
me
writhe
as
we
are
inseparable
friends
everybody
assumes
that
i
am
his
a
kind
of
appoggiatura
to
his
big
note
he
they
suppose
is
my
guide
philosopher
and
great
maecenas
oxford
befriending
the
proletariat
the
thought
of
it
makes
me
sick
that
any
one
should
believe
i
imbibe
his
ideas
echo
his
conceits
and
even
ape
his
gestures
and
manner
of
voice
lost
yourself
inquired
a
despicable
creature
the
other
morning
as
i
came
out
of
r
room
after
finding
him
out
i
could
have
shot
him
dead
as
for
more
than
one
person
thinks
that
he
alone
is
the
brilliant
author
until
at
last
he
himself
has
got
into
the
way
of
thinking
it
it
makes
me
hate
you
like
mad
i
said
to
him
how
can
i
confront
these
people
with
the
naked
truth
r
chuckled
complacently
if
i
deny
your
alleged
supremacy
as
i
did
this
morning
or
if
suddenly
in
a
fit
of
spleen
i
induced
to
declare
that
i
loathe
you
as
i
sometimes
do
more
chuckles
that
your
breath
stinks
your
eyes
bulge
that
you
have
swollen
jugulars
and
a
platter
face
they
will
think
i
am
either
jealous
or
insincere
to
be
your
echo
tho
my
god
i
spat
we
then
grinned
at
one
another
and
i
being
bored
went
to
the
lavatory
and
read
the
newspaper
secure
from
interruption
in
the
tube
a
young
widow
came
in
and
sat
in
front
of
me
demure
a
sort
of
thy
will
be
done
look
the
adaptability
of
human
beings
has
something
in
it
that
seems
horrible
it
is
dreadful
to
think
how
we
have
all
accommodated
ourselves
to
this
war
christian
resignation
is
a
feeble
thing
why
wo
this
demure
widow
with
a
loud
voice
blaspheme
against
this
iniquitous
world
that
permits
this
iniquitous
war
i
myself
licking
a
stamp
the
taste
of
gum
is
really
very
nice
i
hate
it
i
my
dear
fellow
surprised
and
entreating
envelope
gum
is
simply
delicious
i
never
lick
stamps
it
dangerous
microbes
i
i
always
do
i
shall
buy
a
bookful
and
go
away
to
the
seaside
with
them
yes
you
need
to
laughter
thus
gaily
and
jauntily
we
went
on
to
discuss
wines
whiskies
and
worthington
and
i
rounded
it
up
in
a
typical
manner
ah
yes
it
only
when
the
day
is
over
that
the
day
really
begins
what
i
expressed
to
r
my
admiration
for
the
exploit
of
the
brave
and
successful
submarine
commander
max
kennedy
horton
name
for
you
r
was
rather
cold
his
exploits
said
this
bloody
fool
involve
loss
of
life
and
scarcely
make
me
deliriously
eulogistic
i
cleared
my
throat
and
began
your
precious
sociology
again
it
will
be
the
ruin
of
your
career
as
an
artist
it
is
so
interwoven
into
the
fibre
of
your
brain
that
you
never
see
anything
except
in
relation
to
its
state
value
you
are
afraid
to
approve
of
a
lying
thieving
rogue
however
delightful
a
rascal
he
may
be
for
fear
of
what
karl
marx
might
say
you
soon
be
drawing
landscapes
with
taxpayers
in
the
foreground
or
we
shall
get
a
picture
of
ben
nevis
with
keir
hardie
on
the
summit
and
so
on
to
our
own
infinite
mutual
amusement
the
returns
my
essay
i
am
getting
simply
furious
with
an
ambition
i
am
unable
to
satisfy
among
beautiful
london
women
i
can
not
get
to
know
and
in
that
i
can
not
cure
shall
i
ever
find
any
one
shall
i
ever
be
really
well
my
one
solace
is
that
i
do
not
submit
it
infuriates
me
i
resent
it
i
will
never
be
resigned
and
milky
i
will
keep
my
claws
sharp
and
fight
to
the
end

yesterday
ramble
has
left
me
very
sore
in
spirit
london
was
spread
out
before
me
a
vast
campagne
but
i
felt
too
physically
tired
to
explore
i
could
just
amble
along
a
spectator
merely
and
automatically
register
impressions
think
of
the
misery
of
that
i
want
to
see
the
docks
and
dockland
to
enter
east
end
and
to
speak
to
chinamen
and
lascars
i
want
a
knowledge
of
london
of
london
men
london
women
i
was
tingling
with
anticipation
yesterday
and
then
i
grew
tired
and
fretful
and
morose
crawled
back
like
a
weevil
into
my
nut
by
i
was
in
a
library
reading
the
what
a
young
fool
i
was
to
neglect
those
priceless
opportunities
of
studying
and
tasting
life
and
character
in
north
at
borough
council
meetings
boards
of
guardians
and
electioneering
campaigns
not
to
mention
inquests
police
courts
and
country
fairs
instead
of
appraising
all
these
precious
and
genuine
pieces
of
experience
at
their
true
value
my
diary
and
my
mind
were
occupied
only
with
zoology
if
you
please
i
ignored
my
exquisite
chances
i
ramped
around
fuming
and
fretting
full
of
contempt
for
my
circumscribed
existence
and
impatient
as
only
a
youth
can
be
what
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
is
my
present
inability
to
recall
that
life
so
that
instead
of
being
able
now
to
push
my
chair
back
and
entertain
myself
and
others
with
descriptions
of
some
of
those
antique
and
incredible
happenings
my
memory
is
rigid
and
formal
i
remember
only
a
few
names
and
one
or
two
isolated
events
all
that
time
is
just
as
if
it
had
never
been
my
recollections
form
only
an
indefinite
smudge

town
clerks

at

five
of
them
in

garb

i
poached
with

ploughing

dinners
platters
of
roast
beef
and
boiled
potatoes
and
i
bespectacled
student
of
zoology
sitting
uncomfortably
among
valiant
trenchermen
after
their
day
ploughing
election
meetings
in
remote
exmoor
villages
and
those
wonderful
inns
where
i
had
to
spend
the
night
all
are
gone
too
remote
to
bear
recital
yet
just
sufficiently
clear
to
harass
the
mind
in
my
constant
endeavours
to
raise
them
all
again
from
the
dead
in
my
consciousness
i
hate
to
think
it
is
lost
that
my
youth
is
buried
a
cemetery
without
even
headstones
to
an
inquest
on
a
drowned
sailor
disclosing
some
thrilling
story
of
the
wild
seas
off
the
coast
with
a
pitiful
myopia
i
preferred

used
to
carry
smith

me
to
a
board
of

meeting
mingling

and
reports
from
the

now
i
take

tschekov
to
the
museum
london
certainly
lies
before
me
certainly
i
am
alive
at
last
yet
now
my
energy
is
gone
it
is
too
late
i
am
ill
and
tired
it
costs
me
infinite
discomfort
to
write
this
entry
all
the
skin
of
my
right
hand
is
permanently
pins
and
needles
and
in
the
finger
tips
i
have
lost
all
sense
of
touch
the
sight
of
my
right
eye
is
also
very
bad
and
sometimes
i
can
scarcely
read
print
with
it
etc
but
why
should
i
go
on
a
condition
supervenes
in
a
forced
to
live
in
almost
complete
social
isolation
in
a
great
whirling
city
like
london
days
of
routine
follow
each
other
as
swiftly
as
the
weaver
shuttle
and
numb
the
spirit
and
turn
palpitating
life
into
a
silent
picture
show
everywhere
always
in
the
street
people
millions
of
them
whom
i
do
not
know
moving
swiftly
along
i
look
and
look
and
yawn
and
then
one
day
as
i
wake
up
and
race
about
beside
myself
a
swollen
bag
ready
to
burst
with
hope
love
misery
joy
desperation
pro

how
may
i
excuse
myself
for
continuing
to
talk
about
my
affairs
and
for
continuing
to
write
zoological
memoirs
during
the
greatest
war
of
all
time

here
are
some

lacépède
composed
his
des
during
the
french
revolution
then
there
were

and

this
defence
of
course
implicates
me
in
an
unbounded
opinion
of
the
importance
of
my
own
work
he
is
quite
the
little
poet
some
one
said
of
keats
it
is
just
as
if
a
man
remarked
of
buonaparte
said
keats
in
a
pet
that
he
quite
the
little
general
woman
and
a
on
the
way
to
the
albert
hall
came
upon
the
most
beautiful
picture
of
young
maternity
that
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
she
was
a
delightfully
girlish
young
creature
a
perfect
phœnix
of
health
and
beauty
as
she
stood
with
her
little
son
at
the
kerb
waiting
for
a
smiling
and
chatting
to
him
a
luminous
radiance
of
happy
satisfied
maternal
love
maternal
pride
womanliness
streamed
from
her
and
enveloped
me
we
got
on
the
same
the
little
boy
with
his
long
hair
and
dressed
in
velvet
like
little
lord
fauntleroy
said
something
to
her
she
smiled
delightedly
caught
him
up
on
her
knees
and
kissed
him
two
such
pretty
people
never
touched
lips
before
i
certain
of
it
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
this
virginal
creature
was
a
mother
childbirth
left
no
trace
she
must
have
just
budded
off
the
baby
boy
like
a
plant
once
in
her
glance
she
took
me
in
her
purview
and
i
knew
she
knew
i
was
watching
her
in
travelling
backwards
from
kensington
gardens
to
the
boy
again
her
gaze
rested
on
me
a
moment
and
i
of
course
rendered
the
homage
that
was
due
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
no
direct
evidence
that
she
was
the
mother
at
all
albert
hall
while
waiting
outside
the
albert
hall
an
extraordinarily
weird
contrast
thrust
itself
before
me
she
was
the
most
pathetic
piece
of
human
jetsam
that
ever
i
saw
drifting
about
in
this
sea
of
london
faces
tall
gaunt
cadaverous
the
skin
of
her
face
drawn
tightly
over
her
cheekbones
and
over
a
thin
pointed
nose
on
her
feet
brown
sandshoes
dressed
in
a
long
skirt
a
straw
hat
beneath
which
some
scanty
hair
was
scraped
back
and
tied
behind
in
a
knot
this
wretched
soul
of
some
thirty
summers
and
what
summers
stood
in
the
road
beside
the
waiting
queue
and
weakly
passed
the
bow
across
her
violin
which
emitted
a
slight
scraping
sound
she
could
not
play
a
tune
and
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
never
touched
the
strings
they
merely
held
the
handle
a
policeman
passed
and
with
an
eye
on
the
queue
muttered
audibly
not
but
no
one
laughed
then
she
began
to
rummage
in
her
skirt
holding
the
violin
by
the
neck
in
her
right
hand
just
as
she
must
hold
her
brat
by
the
arm
when
at
home
simultaneously
sounds
issued
from
her
mouth
in
a
high
falsetto
key
they
were
unearthly
sounds
the
tiny
voice
of
an
articulating
corpse
underneath
the
coffin
lid
for
a
moment
no
one
realised
that
she
was
reciting
for
she
continued
to
rummage
in
her
skirt
as
she
squeaked
break
break
break
on
thy
cold
gray
stones
o
sea
etc
the
words
were
scarcely
audible
tho
she
stood
but
two
yards
off
but
she
repeated
the
verse
and
i
then
made
out
what
it
was
she
seemed
ashamed
of
herself
and
of
her
plight
almost
without
the
courage
to
foist
this
mockery
of
on
us
one
would
say
she
was
frightened
by
her
own
ugliness
and
her
own
pathos
after
conscientiously
carrying
out
her
programme
but
with
the
distracted
uncomfortable
air
of
some
one
scurrying
over
a
painful
task
like
a
tired
child
gabbling
its
prayers
before
getting
into
bed
she
at
length
produced
from
her
skirt
pocket
a
small
canvas
money
bag
which
she
started
to
hand
around
this
was
the
climax
to
this
harrowing
incident
for
each
time
she
held
out
the
bag
she
smiled
which
stretched
the
skin
still
more
tightly
down
over
her
malar
prominence
and
said
something
an
inarticulate
noise
in
a
very
high
pitch
a
woman
i
whispered
to
r
she
claims
to
be
a
woman
if
any
one
hesitated
a
moment
or
struggled
with
a
purse
she
would
wait
patiently
with
bag
outstretched
and
head
turned
away
the
smile
vanishing
at
once
as
if
the
pinched
face
were
but
too
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
a
rest
from
smiling
she
stood
there
gazing
absently
two
lifeless
eyes
at
the
bottom
of
deep
socket
holes
in
a
head
which
was
almost
a
bare
skull
she
was
perfunctorily
carrying
out
an
objectionable
task
because
she
could
not
kill
the
will
to
live
as
she
looked
away
and
waited
for
you
to
produce
the
copper
she
thought
why
trouble
why
should
i
wait
for
this
man
aid
the
clink
of
the
penny
recalled
her
to
herself
and
she
passed
on
renewing
her
terrible
grimacing
smile
why
did
i
do
something
why
because
i
was
bent
on
hearing
beethoven
fifth
symphony
if
you
please
and
she
may
have
been
a
vagrant
well
got
up
for
the
occasion
a
clever
simulator
rigor
bordis
i
write
like
this
as
if
it
were
a
light
matter
but
i
was
first
i
read
the
paper
then
i
finished
the
book
i
was
reading
spake
not
knowing
quite
what
next
to
do
i
took
my
boots
off
and
poured
out
another
cup
of
coffee
but
these
manœuvres
were
only
the
feeble
attempts
of
a
cowardly
wretch
to
evade
the
main
issue
which
was
how
to
occupy
myself
and
keep
myself
sane
during
the
hour
and
a
half
before
bedtime
before
now
i
have
tried
going
off
to
bed
but
that
does
not
work
i
do
sleep
moreover
i
have
been
in
the
grip
of
a
horrible
mental
unrest
to
sit
still
in
my
chair
much
less
to
lie
in
bed
doing
nothing
seemed
ghastly
i
experienced
all
the
cravings
of
a
dissolute
neurotic
for
a
stimulus
but
what
stimulus
i
wanted
i
did
not
know
had
i
known
i
should
have
gone
and
got
it
the
dipsomaniac
was
a
man
to
be
envied
some
mechanical
means
were
necessary
for
sustaining
life
till
bedtime
i
sat
down
and
played
a
game
of
patience
no
one
knows
how
i
loathe
playing
patience
and
how
much
i
despise
the
people
who
play
it
tiring
of
that
sat
back
in
my
chair
yawned
and
thought
of
a
word
i
wanted
to
look
up
in
the
dictionary
this
quest
forgotten
until
then
came
like
a
beam
of
bright
light
into
a
dark
room
so
looked
the
word
up
leisurely
took
out
my
watch
noted
the
time
and
then
stood
up
with
elbows
on
the
mantelpiece
and
stared
at
myself
in
the
glass
i
was
at
bay
at
last
there
was
simply
nothing
i
could
do
i
would
have
given
worlds
to
have
some
one
to
talk
to
pride
kept
me
from
ringing
for
the
landlady
i
must
stand
motionless
back
to
the
wall
and
wait
for
the
hour
of
my
release
i
had
but
one
idea
that
i
was
surely
beaten
in
this
game
of
life
i
was
very
miserable
indeed
but
being
so
miserable
that
i
could
feel
more
so
i
began
to
recover
after
a
while
i
began
to
visualise
my
lamentable
situation
and
rose
above
it
as
i
did
so
i
staged
it
before
my
mind
eye
and
observed
myself
as
hero
of
the
plot
i
saw
myself
sitting
in
a
dirty
armchair
in
a
dirty
house
in
a
dirty
london
street
with
the
landlady
dirty
daughter
singing
little
grey
home
in
the
west
my
head
obscured
in
a
cloud
of
depression
and
in
my
mind
the
thought
that
if
life
be
a
test
of
endurance
i
must
hang
on
grimly
to
the
arms
of
the
chair
and
sit
tight
till
bedtime
this
attitude
proved
a
useful
means
of
when
i
had
dramatised
my
misery
i
enjoyed
it
and
acute
mental
pain
turned
into
merely
aesthetic
malaise
a
lurid
day
suffering
from
the
most
horrible
physical
languor
wrote
the
doctor
saying
i
was
rapidly
sliding
down
a
steep
place
into
the
sea
like
the
swine
i
am
could
i
see
him
endured
an
hour
torture
of
indecision
asking
myself
whether
i
should
go
over
to
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
or
should
i
go
to
the
fabian
society
and
hear
bernard
shaw
kept
putting
off
the
decision
even
till
after
dinner
if
i
went
to
the
flat
i
must
shave
to
shave
required
hot
water
the
landlady
had
already
cleared
the
table
and
was
rapidly
retreating
something
must
be
done
and
at
once
i
called
the
old
thing
back
impulsively
and
ordered
shaving
water
consoling
myself
with
the
reflection
that
it
was
still
unnecessary
to
decide
the
hot
water
could
be
at
hand
in
case
the
worst
happened
if
i
decided
on
matrimony
i
could
shave
forthwith
should
i
after
dark
i
always
shave
in
the
because
of
the
better
gaslight
drank
some
coffee
and
next
found
myself
slowly
mournfully
putting
on
hat
and
coat
you
ca
shave
in
hat
and
coat
so
i
concluded
i
had
decided
on
shaw
slowly
undid
the
front
door
latch
and
went
off
shaw
bored
me
he
is
sat
beside
a
youth
reading
the
in
the
evening
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
she
refused
once
perhaps
but
now
i
do
think
i
have
any
moral
right
to
propose
to
any
woman
seeing
the
state
of
my
health
and
i
did
not
actually
intend
or
wish
to
it
was
just
to
get
it
off
my
mind
a
plain
statement
if
i
do
really
and
truly
love
her
it
was
a
perfectly
heartless
comedy
but
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
i
do
with
me
moments
of
headstrong
passion
alternate
with
moods
of
perfectly
immobile
it
is
a
relief
to
have
spoken
very
miserable
asked
r
three
times
to
come
and
have
dinner
with
me
each
time
he
refused
my
nerves
are
completely
jangled
voulu
george
that
the
rub
she
observed
me
carefully
i
looking
a
perfect
wreck
tu
voulu
george
but
it
mainly
and
not
on
her
account
i
said
some
things
are
too
funny
to
laugh
at
is
that
why
you
are
so
solemn
no
i
answered
i
not
solemn
i
am
laughing
some
things
are
too
solemn
to
be
serious
about
she
saw
me
off
at
the
door
and
smiled
quietly
an
amused
faraway
smile
of
feline
satisfaction
horrible
nervous
depression
thinking
of
suicide
with
a
pistol
a
browning
or
of
days
mysterious
disappearance
when
i
will
go
and
live
in
a
good
hotel
spend
all
my
money
and
live
among
human
beings
with
eyes
and
noses
and
legs
this
isolation
am
i
going
mad
if
i
disappeared
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
if
any
one
missed
me
still
thinking
of
suicide
it
seems
the
only
way
out
this
morning
my
essay
was
returned
by
the
editor
of
one
by
one
i
have
been
divested
of
all
my
most
cherished
illusions
once
my
ambitions
gave
me
the
fuel
with
which
to
keep
myself
alive
one
after
another
they
have
been
foiled
and
now
i
nothing
to
burn
i
am
daily
facing
the
fact
that
my
ambitions
have
overtaxed
my
abilities
and
health
for
years
my
whole
existence
has
rested
on
a
false
estimate
of
my
own
value
and
my
life
been
revolving
around
a
foolish
but
i
know
myself
as
i
am
at
last
and
am
not
at
all
enamoured
the
future
has
nothing
for
me
i
am
wearied
of
my
life
already
what
is
there
for
any
of
us
to
do
but
die
before
going
over
bought
deliberately
in
order
to
find
a
joke
or
better
still
some
cynicism
about
women
to
fire
off
at
her
rehearsed
one
joke
one
witticism
from
oscar
wilde
and
one
personal
anecdote
the
latter
for
the
most
part
false
none
of
which
came
off
tho
i
succeeded
in
carrying
off
a
nonchalant
or
even
jaunty
bearing
do
you
ever
swear
i
asked
it
a
good
thing
you
know
swearing
is
like
pimples
better
to
come
out
cleanses
the
moral
system
the
person
who
controls
himself
must
have
lots
of
terrible
oaths
circulating
in
his
blood
swearing
is
not
the
only
remedy
i
suppose
you
prefer
the
gilded
pill
of
a
curate
sermon
i
prefer
pimples
to
pills
is
it
a
wonder
she
does
not
love
me
i
wonder
why
i
paint
myself
in
such
horrid
colours
why
have
i
this
morbid
pleasure
in
pretending
to
those
i
love
that
i
am
a
beast
and
a
cynic
i
suffer
i
suppose
from
a
lacerated
from
a
painful
loneliness
from
the
consciousness
of
how
ridiculous
i
have
made
myself
and
that
most
people
if
they
knew
would
regard
me
with
loathing
and
disgust
i
am
very
unhappy
i
am
unhappy
because
she
does
not
care
for
me
and
i
am
chiefly
unhappy
because
i
do
not
care
for
her
instead
of
a
passion
only
a
dragging
heavy
chain
of
attraction
some
inflexible
law
makes
me
gravitate
to
her
seizes
me
by
the
neck
and
suspends
me
over
her
i
can
not
look
away
in
the
early
days
when
i
did
my
best
to
strangle
my
love
as
one
wou
a
bastard
child
i
took
courage
in
the
fact
that
for
a
man
like
me
the
murder
was
necessary
there
were
books
to
write
and
to
read
and
name
and
fame
perhaps
to
these
everything
must
be
sacrificed
that
is
all
gone
now
no
man
could
have
withstood
for
ever
that
concentrated
essence
of
womanhood
that
flowed
from
her
still
the
declaration
has
made
amends
she
is
pleased
about
it
it
is
a
scalp
yet
how
can
i
forgive
her
for
saying
she
supposed
it
was
a
natural
instinct
for
a
girl
not
to
feel
drawn
to
an
invalid
like
me
that
was
cruel
tho
true
i
might
be
captain
scott
writing
his
last
words
amid
antarctic
cold
and
desolation
it
is
very
cold
i
am
sitting
hunched
up
by
the
fire
in
my
lodgings
after
a
meal
of
tough
meat
and
cold
i
am
full
of
my
only
pleasure
now
it
is
very
cold
and
i
can
not
get
warm
try
as
i
will
my
various
nervous
derangements
take
different
forms
this
time
my
peripheral
circulation
is
affected
and
the
hand
arm
and
shoulder
are
permanently
cold
my
right
hand
is
blue
tho
i
shut
up
the
window
and
piled
up
a
roaring
fire
it
antarctic
cold
and
desolation
london
in
november
from
the
inside
of
a
dingy
can
be
very
terrible
indeed
this
celestial
isolation
will
send
me
out
of
my
mind
i
marvel
how
god
can
stick
it
lonely
damp
and
cold
in
the
clouds
that
is
how
i
live
too
but
then
i
am
not
god
i
fall
back
on
this
journal
just
as
some
other
poor
devil
takes
to
drink
i
too
have
toyed
with
the
idea
of
drinking
hard
i
have
frequented
bars
and
billiards
saloons
and
in
fits
of
depression
done
my
best
to
forget
myself
but
i
am
not
sufficiently
fond
of
alcohol
and
it
would
take
a
lot
to
make
forget
myself
so
i
plunge
into
these
literary
excesses
and
drown
my
sorrows
in
stephens
ink
it
gives
me
a
sulky
pleasure
to
think
that
some
day
somebody
will
know
it
is
humiliating
to
feel
ill
as
i
do
if
i
had
consumption
the
disease
would
act
as
a
stimulus
i
could
strike
an
attitude
feverishly
and
be
histrionic
but
to
be
merely
below
par
to
feel
like
a
bunny
rabbit
perennially
poorly
saps
my
character
and
mental
vigour
i
want
to
crawl
away
and
die
like
a
rat
in
a
hole
a
bronzed
healthy
man
makes
me
wince
healthy
people
regard
a
chronic
sickly
man
as
a
leper
they
suspect
him
something
fishy
still
at
home
ill
if
anything
r
is
more
of
a
précieux
than
i
am
myself
at
the
present
moment
he
is
tickling
himself
with
the
idea
that
he
in
love
with
a
certain
damsel
from
the
states
he
reports
to
me
fragments
of
his
conversations
with
her
how
he
snatches
a
fearful
joy
by
skirting
dangerous
conversational
territory
or
he
takes
a
pencil
and
deftly
outlines
her
profile
or
the
rondeur
of
her
bosom
or
he
discourses
at
length
on
her
nose
or
eye
i
can
well
imagine
him
driving
a
woman
crazy
and
then
collecting
her
tears
in
a
bottle
as
mementoes
then
whenever
he
requires
a
little
heart
stimulus
he
could
take
the
phial
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
watch
the
tears
condensing
why
do
you
marry
her
out
of
hand
and
be
done
with
all
this
dalliance
i
can
tell
you
what
the
matter
with
you
i
growled
you
a
landscape
artist
you
grow
to
resemble
that
mean
jewy
secretive
petty
creature
turner
and
allow
no
human
being
to
interfere
with
your
art
a
fine
artist
perhaps
but
what
a
man
finish
up
with
a
mrs
danby
yes
he
answered
quoting
tennyson
with
great
aptness
and
my
salvation
for
a
sketch
like
romney
deserting
his
wife
if
i
were
not
married
i
should
have
no
wife
to
desert
it
is
useless
to
argue
with
him
his
cosmogony
is
wrongly
centred
in
art
not
life
life
interests
him
he
ca
altogether
resign
himself
to
the
cowl
and
the
tonsured
head
but
he
will
not
plunge
he
insists
on
being
a
spectator
watching
the
maelstrom
from
the
bank
and
remarking
exquisitely
ah
there
is
a
very
fine
sorrow
or
what
an
exquisite
sensation
the
other
day
after
one
of
our
furious
conversational
bouts
around
this
subject
i
drew
an
insect
cut
it
out
and
pinned
the
slip
in
a
collecting
box
then
suddenly
producing
the
box
and
opening
it
with
a
facetious
grin
i
said
here
is
a
jolly
little
sorrow
i
caught
this
morning
the
joke
pleased
him
and
we
roared
bellowed
that
terrible
forefinger
of
yours
he
smiled
like
cardinal
richelieu
eyes
piercing
i
suggested
with
appreciation
it
is
because
i
tap
him
on
his
shirt
front
in
the
space
between
waistcoat
and
tie
aggressively
for
emphasis
in
conversation
you
must
regard
my
passion
for
painting
he
began
once
more
as
a
sort
of
dipsomania
i
really
ca
help
myself
i
jumped
on
him
vehemently
exactly
my
pernickety
friend
it
something
abnormal
and
unnatural
when
for
purposes
of
i
see
a
man
deliberately
lop
off
great
branches
of
himself
so
as
to
divert
his
strength
into
one
limb
i
know
that
if
he
is
successful
he
be
something
as
vulgar
as
a
fat
woman
at
a
country
fair
and
if
he
is
unsuccessful
he
be
just
a
pathetic
mutilation
you
are
trying
to
pervert
a
natural
instinct
you
want
to
paint
i
believe
quite
so
but
when
a
boy
reaches
the
age
of
puberty
he
does
not
grow
a
palette
on
his
chin
but
hair
still
now
you
recognise
it
as
a
bad
habit
why
need
i
say
more
why
indeed
it
a
vice
and
i
very
sorry
for
you
old
boy
i
do
all
i
can
come
and
have
some
dinner
with
me
oh
thank
you
very
much
says
my
gentleman
but
i
not
at
all
sorry
for
myself
i
thought
as
much
so
that
we
are
not
so
very
much
agreed
after
all
we
not
shaking
hands
after
the
boxing
contest
but
scowling
at
each
other
from
the

your

orations
my
dear
barbellion
in
full
canonicals
he
reflected
are
worthy
of
a
larger
audience
to
find
of
all
people
preaching
i
thought
you
were
philosopher
enough
to
see
the
angle
of
every
one
vision
and
broadminded
so
as
to
see
every
point
of
view
besides
you
are
as
afraid
of
marriage
as
i
am
and
for
the
same
reasons
i
confess
when
in
the
philosophic
citadel
of
my
own
armchair
i
began
i
see
every
one
point
of
view
you
sit
on
the
other
side
of
the
rug
and
put
out
the
suggestion
tentatively
that
murder
may
be
a
moral
act
i
examine
your
argument
and
am
disposed
to
accept
it
but
when
you
slit
up
my
brother
abdomen
before
my
eyes
i
am
sufficiently
weak
and
human
to
punch
you
on
the
nose
you
are
too
cold
and
olympian
up
above
the
snowline
with
a
box
of
paints
it
is
very
beautiful
among
the
snows
i
suppose
so
exit
great
physical
languor
especially
in
the
morning
it
is
calvary
to
get
out
of
bed
and
shoulder
the
day
burden
what
been
the
matter
they
ask
oh
senile
decay
general
histolysis
of
the
tissues
i
say
fencing
i
looked
at
myself
accidentally
in
the
glass
and
noticed
at
once
the
alarming
extent
of
my
dejection
quite
unconsciously
i
turned
my
head
away
and
shook
it
making
the
noise
with
my
teeth
and
tongue
which
means
dear
dear
m
tells
me
these
waves
of
are
quite
unaccountable
unless
i
were
leading
a
dissolute
life
which
you
do
not
appear
to
be
doing
damn
his
eyes
reading
nietzsche
what
splendid
physic
he
is
to
pomeranian
puppies
like
myself
i
am
a
hopeless
coward
thunderstorms
always
frighten
me
the
smallest
cut
alarms
for
fear
of
blood
poisoning
and
i
always
dab
on
antiseptics
at
once
but
nietzsche
makes
me
feel
a
perfect
mastiff
test
for
true
the
test
for
true
love
is
whether
you
can
endure
the
thought
of
cutting
your
sweetheart
the
onychiotomic
test
or
whether
you
find
your
julia
sweat
as
sweet
as
otto
of
roses
i
told
her
this
probably
she
thinks
i
only
saw
it
in
a
book
on
sunday
went
to
the
albert
hall
and
warmed
myself
at
the
orchestra
it
is
a
wonderful
sight
to
watch
an
orchestra
playing
from
the
gallery
it
spurts
and
flickers
like
a
flame
its
incessant
activity
arrests
the
attention
and
holds
it
just
as
a
fire
does
even
a
deaf
man
would
be
fascinated
heard
chopin
funeral
march
and
other
things
it
would
be
a
rich
experience
to
be
able
to
be
in
your
coffin
at
rest
and
listen
to
chopin
funeral
march
being
played
above
you
by
a
string
orchestra
with
sir
henry
wood
conducting
sir
henry
like
a
melanic
messiah
was
crucified
as
usual
the
hungarian
rhapsody
no
causing
him
the
most
awful
agony
more
than
once
lately
have
been
to
see
and
admire
rodin
recent
gifts
to
the
nation
exhibited
at
the
victoria
and
albert
museum
the
prodigal
son
is
beethoven
fifth
symphony
done
in
stone
it
was
only
on
my
second
visit
that
i
noticed
the
small
pebble
in
each
hand
a
superb
touch
what
a
frenzy
of
remorse
the
fallen
angel
i
loved
most
the
legs
of
the
woman
droop
lifelessly
backwards
in
an
intoxicating
curve
the
eye
caresses
it
down
the
thighs
and
over
the
calves
to
the
tips
of
the
toes
like
the
hind
limbs
of
some
beautiful
dead
gazelle
he
has
brought
off
exactly
the
same
effect
in
the
woman
in
the
group
called
eternal
spring
which
i
have
only
seen
in
a
photograph
this
morning
at
lay
in
bed
on
my
back
warm
and
comfortable
and
for
the
first
time
for
many
weeks
with
no
pain
or
discomfort
of
any
kind
the
mattress
curved
up
around
my
body
and
legs
and
held
me
in
a
soft
warm
embrace
i
shut
my
eyes
and
whistled
the
saccharine
melody
for
solo
violin
in
chopin
funeral
march
i
wanted
the
moment
prolonged
for
hours
chases
the
soul
out
of
a
man
he
becomes
a
body
purely
physical
this
evening
she
promised
to
be
my
wife
after
a
long
silent
ramble
together
thro
dark
london
squares
and
streets
i
am
beside
myself
i
know
now
i
love
her
with
passion
health
and
ambition
and
sanity
are
returning
projects
in
view
to
make
her
happy
and
myself
worthy
to
get
married
to
prepare
and
publish
a
volume
of
this
journal
to
write
two
essays
for
which
shall
surely
induce
the
editor
to
publish
and
not
write
me
merely
long
complimentary
and
encouraging
letters
as
heretofore
wired
to
a
the
brave
little
pennon
has
been
hauled
down
have
so
many
projects
in
view
and
so
little
time
in
which
to
get
them
done
moreover
i
am
always
haunted
by
the
fear
that
i
may
never
finish
them
thro
physical
or
temperamental
disabilities
a
breakdown
in
health
or
in
purpose
i
am
one
of
those
who
are
apt
to
die
unexpectedly
and
no
one
would
be
surprised
an
inquest
would
probably
be
unnecessary
i
badly
want
to
live
say
another
twelve
months
hey
a
man
a
fool
that
wants
to
die
i
shook
her
angrily
by
the
shoulders
and
said
why
do
i
love
you
tell
me
but
she
only
smiled
gently
and
said
i
can
not
tell
i
ought
not
to
love
her
i
know
every
omen
is
against
it
then
i
am
full
of
an
intellectual
malvolio
proud
of
his
brains
and
air
of
distinction
then
i
am
fickle
passionate
polygamous
i
am
haunted
by
the
memory
of
how
i
have
sloughed
off
one
enthusiasm
after
another
i
used
to
dissect
snails
in
a
in
the
kitchen
while
mother
baked
the
cakes
the
unravelling
of
the
internal
economy
of
a
caused
as
great
an
emotional
storm
as
the
unfinished
symphony
does
i
look
for
the
first
parasol
in
kensington
gardens
with
the
same
interest
as
once
i
sought
out
the
first
snowdrop
or
listened
for
the
first
cuckoo
i
am
as
anxious
to
identify
an
instrument
in
sir
henry
orchestra
as
once
to
identify
the
song
of
a
new
bird
in
the
woods
nothing
is
further
from
my
intention
or
desire
to
continue
my
old
habit
of
nature
study
i
never
read
nature
books
my
old
favourites
waterton
gilbert
white
have
no
interest
for
me
in
fact
they
give
me
slight
mental
nausea
even
to
glance
at
wiedersheim
good
old
wiedersheim
is
now
deposed
by
a
text
book
on
harmony
my
main
desire
just
now
is
to
hear
the
best
music
in
the
country
i
wore
blinkers
and
saw
only
zoology
now
in
london
i
taken
the
bit
in
my
mouth
and
it
a
mouth
of
iron
wanting
a
run
for
all
my
troubles
before
death
strikes
me
down
all
this
evidence
of
my
temperamental
instability
alarms
and
distresses
me
on
reflection
and
makes
the
soul
weary
i
wish
i
loved
more
steadily
i
am
always
sidetracking
myself
the
title
of
husband
scares
me
henry
wood
went
to
the
queen
hall
sat
in
the
orchestra
and
watched
sir
statuesque
figure
conducting
thro
a
forest
of
bows
which
pleased
me
mightily
he
would
be
worth
watching
if
you
were
stone
deaf
if
you
could
not
hear
a
sound
the
animation
and
excitement
of
an
orchestra
in
full
swing
with
the
conductor
cutting
and
slashing
at
invisible
foes
make
a
magnificent
spectacle
the
face
of
sir
henry
wood
strikes
me
as
very
much
like
the
traditional
pictures
of
jesus
christ
tho
sir
henry
is
dark
the
melanic
messiah
i
call
him
very
much
to
my
own
delight
rodin
ought
to
do
him
in
stone
chesterfield
ideal
of
a
man
a
corinthian
edifice
on
tuscan
foundations
in
sir
henry
case
there
can
be
no
disputing
the
tuscan
foundations
however
swift
and
elegant
the
movements
of
his
arms
his
splendid
lower
extremities
remain
as
firm
as
stone
columns
while
the
music
is
calm
and
serene
his
right
hand
and
baton
execute
in
concert
with
the
left
perfect
geometric
curves
around
his
head
then
as
it
gathers
in
force
and
volume
when
the
bows
begin
to
dart
swiftly
across
the
fiddles
and
the
trumpets
and
trombones
blaze
away
in
a
conflagration
we
are
all
expectant
and
even
a
little
fearful
to
observe
his
cuts
the
tension
grows
i
hold
my
breath
sir
henry
snatches
a
second
to
throw
back
a
lock
of
his
hair
that
has
fallen
limply
across
his
forehead
then
goes
on
in
unrelenting
pursuit
cutting
and
slashing
at
hordes
of
invisible
fiends
that
leap
howling
out
towards
him
there
is
a
great
turmoil
of
combat
but
the
conductor
struggles
on
till
the
great
explosion
happens
but
in
spite
of
that
you
see
him
still
standing
thro
a
cloud
of
great
chords
quite
undaunted
his
sword
zigzags
up
and
down
the
scale
suddenly
the
closed
fist
of
his
left
hand
shoots
up
straight
and
points
to
the
zenith
like
the
arm
of
a
heathen
priest
appealing
to
baal
to
bring
down
fire
from
heaven
but
the
appeal
avails
nought
and
it
looks
as
tho
it
were
all
up
for
poor
sir
henry
the
music
is
just
as
infuriated
his
body
writhes
with
it
the
melanic
messiah
crucified
by
the
inappeasable
desire
to
express
by
visible
gestures
all
that
he
feels
in
his
heart
he
surrenders
so
you
think
he
opens
out
both
arms
wide
and
baring
his
breast
dares
them
all
to
do
their
worst
like
the
picture
of
moffat
the
missionary
among
the
savages
of
the
dark
continent
and
yet
he
wins
after
all
at
the
very
last
moment
he
seems
to
summon
all
his
remaining
strength
and
in
one
final
and
devastating
sweep
mows
down
the
orchestra
rank
by
rank
you
awake
from
the
nightmare
to
discover
the
victor
acknowledging
the
applause
in
a
series
of
his
inimitable
bows
one
ought
to
pack
one
ears
up
with
cotton
wool
at
a
concert
where
sir
henry
conducts
otherwise
the
music
is
apt
to
distract
one
attention
wanted
to
be
at
the
head
of
a
cavalry
charge
sword
over
head
but
i
rather
fight
an
orchestra
with
a
baton
fifth
this
symphony
always
works
me
up
into
an
ecstasy
in
ecstatic
sympathy
with
its
dread
fulness
i
could
stand
up
in
the
balcony
and
fling
myself
down
passionately
into
the
arena
below
yet
there
were
women
sitting
alongside
me
knitting
it
so
annoyed
and
irritated
me
that
at
the
end
of
the
first
movement
i
got
up
and
sat
elsewhere
they
would
have
sat
knitting
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
i
suppose
at
the
end
of
the
second
movement
two
or
three
other
women
got
up
and
went
home
to
tea
it
would
have
surprised
me
no
more
to
have
seen
a
cork
extract
itself
from
its
bottle
and
promenade
just
lately
i
heard
a
lot
of
music
including
pathétique
and
fifth
symphonies
some
debussy
and
odd
pieces
by
dukas
glinka
smetana
mozart
i
am
of
impressions
of
all
this
precious
stuff
and
scarcely
know
what
to
write
as
usual
the
third
movement
of
the
pathétique
produced
a
frenzy
of
exhilaration
i
seemed
to
put
on
several
inches
around
my
chest
and
wished
to
shout
in
a
voice
of
thunder
the
conventions
of
a
public
concert
hall
are
dreadfully
oppressive
at
such
times
i
could
have
eaten
all
the
elephants
of
hindustan
and
picked
my
teeth
with
the
spire
of
strassburg
cathedral
in
the
last
movement
of
the
fifth
symphony
of
that
splendid
fellow
tschaikovsky
the
orchestra
seemed
to
gallop
away
leaving
poor
landon
ronald
to
wave
his
whip
in
a
ridiculously
ineffective
way
they
went
on
crashing
down
chords
and
just
before
the
end
i
had
the
awful
presentiment
that
the
orchestra
simply
could
not
stop
i
sat
still
straining
every
nerve
in
the
expectancy
that
this
chord
or
the
next
or
the
next
was
the
end
but
it
went
on
pounding
down
each
one
seemed
the
last
but
every
time
another
followed
as
passionate
and
emphatic
as
the
one
before
until
finally
whatever
this
inhuman
orchestra
was
attempting
to
crush
and
destroy
must
have
been
reduced
to
shapeless
pulp
i
wanted
to
board
the
platform
and
plead
with
them
elderly
gentlemen
turned
their
heads
nervously
everyone
was
breathless
we
all
wanted
to
call
for
god
sake
stop
to
do
anything
to
still
this
awful
lust
for
annihilation
the
end
came
quickly
in
four
drum
beats
in
quick
succession
i
have
never
seen
such
hate
such
passionate
intensity
of
the
will
to
destroy
and
tschaikovsky
was
a
russian
debussy
was
a
welcome
change
faun
is
a
musical
setting
to
an
oscitatory
exercise
it
is
an
orchestral
yawn
oh
so
tired
came
away
thoroughly
delighted
wanted
to
say
to
every
one
bally
good
ai
it
and
then
we
would
all
shake
hands
and
go
home
whistling
my
rooms
are
littered
with
old
concert
programmes
and
the
prescriptions
in
the
yellow
envelopes
of
the
dispenser
for
my
various
ailments
and
diseases
and
books
books
books
among
the
latter
those
lying
on
my
table
at
this
moment
are
plays
of
brieux
the
sequel
to
the
meaning
of
by
willam
james
good
and
dostoievsky
marie
bashkirtseff
i
have
found
time
to
read
only
the
first
chapter
of
this
last
and
am
almost
afraid
to
go
on
it
would
be
so
humiliating
to
find
i
was
only
her
duplicate
on
my
mantelpiece
stands
a
photograph
of
huxley
the
hero
of
my
youth
which
old
b
has
always
taken
to
be
that
of
my
grandpapa
a
mask
of
voltaire
when
first
hung
up
made
him
chuckle
with
indecent
laughter
a
regular
who
is
it
he
said
this
morning
being
sunday
went
to
petticoat
lane
and
enjoyed
myself
on
turning
the
corner
to
go
into
middlesex
street
as
it
it
now
called
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
a
little
girl
a
jewess
being
tackled
for
selling
belgian
flags
by
two
policemen
who
ultimately
marched
her
off
to
the
police
station
in
the
lane
first
of
all
was
a
royal
ascot
jockey
scales
made
of
brass
and
upholstered
in
gaudy
red
velvet
a
penny
a
time
a
very
fat
man
was
being
weighed
and
looked
a
little
distressed
on
being
given
his
ticket
another
stone
he
told
the
crowd
mournfully
you
have
to
eat
less
pork
some
one
volunteered
and
we
all
laughed
next
door
to
the
scales
was
a
man
selling
gyroscopes
something
scientific
amusing
as
well
as
instructive
illustrating
the
principles
of
gravity
and
stability
what
i
show
you
is
what
i
sell
price
one
shilling
who
i
stopped
next
at
a
stall
containing
nothing
but
caps
any
size
any
colour
any
pattern
a
shilling
apiece
now
then
this
show
was
being
run
by
two
men
a
jew
in
a
fur
cap
on
one
side
of
the
stall
and
a
very
sort
of
captain
cuttle
on
the
other
a
seafaring
man
almost
as
broad
as
he
was
long
with
a
game
leg
and
the
voice
of
a
skipper
in
a
hurricane
both
these
men
were
selling
caps
at
a
prodigious
pace
and
with
the
insouciance
of
tradesmen
sure
of
their
custom
the
skipper
would
seize
a
cap
chuck
it
across
to
a
timid
prospective
purchaser
and
if
he
dropped
it
chuck
him
over
another
crying
with
a
boisterousness
oh
what
a
game
what
a
bees
nest
upon
the
small
head
of
another
customer
he
would
squash
down
his
largest
sized
cap
saying
at
once
there
you
look
the
finest
gentleman
oh
ah
a
little
too
large
at
which
we
all
laughed
the
customer
looked
silly
but
took
no
offence
try
this
yells
the
skipper
above
the
storm
and
takes
off
his
own
cap
oh
ye
need
be
afraid
i
washed
my
hair
last
year
laughter
then
to
his
partner
the
jew
on
the
other
side
of
the
stall
oh
what
a
face
you
got
here
for
any
one
who
can
tell
me
what
it
is
why
not
take
it
to
the
trenches
and
get
it
smashed
in
the
jew
wore

on

chucking
them
at
the
purchasers
perhaps
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
things
i
saw
was
a
stream
of
young
men

one
after

came
up
to
a

a

swallowed

remarkable

attentively
observed
by
numerous

all
going

working
a
record
a
different
one
and
every
tradesman
shouting
his
wares
a
perfect
pandemonium

is
that
easily
calculable
element
in
your
nature
dear
boy
i
said
by
which
you
forego
the
dignity
of
a
human
being
and
come
under
an
inflexible
natural
law
i
can
anticipate
your
movements
intentions
and
opinions
long
beforehand
for

i
know
quite
well
that
every
saturday
morning
will
see
you
with
new

your
arm
i
know
that
the
words
or
uttered
slowly
and
deliberately
in
your
ear
will
produce
a
perfectly
definite
reaction
i
bet
you
ca
predict
what
i
am
going
to
buy

to

you

last
september
when
the

stood
almost
at
the
gates
of

this
was
a
lucky
stroke
for
me
for
he
knew
he
was
rubbing
me
on
the
raw
we

sometimes
we

answered
facetiously
his

a

hold
on

says
for
example

of

the

no

at

leave
it

simply

your

it

complete
abstinence
from

it
rather
well

the
elephants
of

and
pick
my
teeth
with
the
spire
of
strassburg
cathedral
see
january
i
have
grown
so
ridiculously
hypercritical
and
fastidious
that
i
will
refuse
a
man
invitation
to
dinner
because
he
has
watery
blue
eyes
or
hate
him
for
a
mannerism
or
an
impediment
or
affectation

gird
at

the
arrogance
of
a

youth
of
some
oddity
who
should
afford
a
sane
mind
endless
amusement

write
off
as
a
and
dismiss
with
a
flourish
of
contempt
my
intellectual
arrogance
excepting
at
such
times
as
i
become
conscious
of
it
and
pull
myself
up
is
incredible
it
is
incredible
because
i
have
no
personal
courage
and
all
this
pride
boils
up
behind
a
timid
exterior
i
quail
often
before
stupid
but
persons
who
consequently
never
realise
my
contempt
of
them
then
afterwards
i
writhe
to
think
i
never
stood
up
to
this
fool
never
uttered
an
appropriate
word
to
interfere
with
another
nauseating
it
exasperates
me
to
be
unable
to
give
a
roland
for
an
oliver
even
servants
and
underlings
tick
me
off
to
fail
always
in
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
make
the
satisfying
rejoinder
or
riposte
i
suffer
from
such
a
savage
that
i
fear
to
enter
the
lists
with
a
man
i
dislike
on
account
of
the
mental
anguish
i
should
suffer
if
he
worsted
me
i
am
therefore
bottled
up
tight
both
my
hates
and
loves
for
a
coward
is
not
only
afraid
to
tell
a
man
he
hates
him
but
is
nervous
too
of
letting
go
of
his
feeling
of
affection
or
regard
lest
it
be
rejected
or
not
returned
i
shudder
to
think
of
such
remarks
as
referring
to
me
he
one
of
my
admirers
you
know
sardonically
or
i
simply
ca
get
rid
of
him
if
however
my
cork
come
out
there
is
an
explosion
and
placid
people
occasionally
marvel
to
hear
violent
language
streaming
from
my
lips
and
nasty
acid
and
facetious
remarks
of
course
to
intimate
friends
only
about
three
persons
in
the
wide
wide
world
i
can
always
give
free
vent
to
my
feelings
and
i
do
so
in
privacy
with
that
violence
in
which
a
weak
character
usually
finds
some
compensation
for
his
intolerable
reserve
and
restraint
in
public
i
can
never
marvel
enough
at
the
ineradicable
turpitude
of
my
existence
at
my
and
the
remarkable
contrast
between
the
face
i
turn
to
the
outside
world
and
the
face
my
friends
know
like
leading
a
double
existence
or
artificially
constructing
a
puppet
to
dangle
before
the
crowd
while
i
fulminate
behind
the
scenes
if
only
i
had
the
moral
courage
to
play
my
part
in
life
to
take
the
stage
and
be
myself
to
enjoy
the
delightful
sensation
of
making
my
presence
felt
instead
of
this
vapourish
mumming
then
this
journal
would
be
quite
unnecessary
for
to
me
is
a
necessity
of
life
and
what
can
not
be
expressed
one
way
must
be
expressed
in
another
when
colossal
egotism
is
driven
underground
whether
by
a
steely
surface
environment
or
an
unworkable
temperament
or
as
in
my
case
by
both
you
get
a
truly
remarkable
result
and
the
victim
a
truly
remarkable
pain
the
pain
one
might
say
of
continuously
unsuccessful
attempts
at
parturition
it
is
perhaps
not
the
whole
explanation
to
say
that
my
milky
affability
before
say
bores
or
clods
is
sheer
personal
cowardice
it
is
partly
real
affability
i
am
so
glad
to
have
opposite
me
some
one
who
is
making
himself
pleasant
and
affable
and
sympathetic
that
i
forget
for
the
moment
that
he
is
an
unconscionable
a
sycophant
toady
etc
my
first
impulse
is
always
to
credit
folk
with
being
nicer
cleverer
more
honest
and
amiable
than
they
are
then
on
reflection
i
discover
unpleasing
characteristics
i
detect
their
little
motives
and
hate
myself
for
not
speaking
the
fellow
is
intolerable
why
did
i
not
tell
him
so
bitter
recriminations
from
my
critical
self
upon
my
flabby
amiable
half
on
the
whole
then
i
lead
a
pretty
disgraceful
inner
life
excepting
when
i
pull
myself
together
and
smile
benignly
on
all
things
with
a
philosophical
smugness
such
as
is
by
no
means
my
mood
at
this
present
moment
i
am
so
envious
that
a
reprint
of
one
of
romney
ramus
girls
sends
me
into
a
dry
tearless
anger
for
the
moment
till
i
turn
over
the
next
page
inwardly
i
was
exacerbated
this
morning
when
r
recited
come
and
have
a
tiddle
at
the
old
brown
bear
and
explained
how
a
charming
young
person
sang
this
at
breakfast
the
other
morning
it
was
simply
charming
for
him
to
hear
as
i
brushed
my
hair
i
decided
i
was
quite
and
i
mused
that
e
was
really
a
lucky
girl
all
that
is
the
matter
with
me
is
a
colossal
conceit
and
a
colossal
discontent
qualities
exaggerated
where
a
man
finds
himself
in
an
environment
which
you
observant
people
will
notice
that
this
explanation
is
something
of
a
whereby
the
virtue
goes
out
of
my
confession
i
plead
guilty
but
great
and
unprecedented
provocation
as
well
intense
pride
of
individuality
forbids
that
i
should
ever
be
other
than
shall
i
say
amiably
disposed
towards
myself
however
displeased
i
may
be
with
my
environment
it
is
indeed
impossible
without
sending
him
to
a
lunatic
asylum
ever
to
knock
a
man
off
the
balance
of
his
a
man
loyalty
to
himself
is
the
most
thing
imaginable

i
have
had
this
printed
in
large
black
characters
on
a
card
framed
and
nailed
to
my
coffin
of
journals
i
told
the
printer
first
to
say
but
he
suggested
that
one
guinea
was
quite
enough
i
agreed
but
wondered
how
the
devil
knew
what
the
journals
were
worth
nobody
knows
next
month

expect
i
shall
have
a
hand
painted
on

and
pointing
towards

after
that
i
shall

standing

his
hatchet
up

these
precious
journals
supposing
i
lost
them
i
can
not
imagine
the
anguish
it
would
cause
me
it
would
be
the
death
of
my
real
self
and
as
i
should
take
no
pleasure
in
the
perpetuation
of
my
flabby
flaccid

amiable
i
should
probably
commit
suicide

discovered
the

of

also
conducted

into
the
anatomy
and
development
of

but
all
his
mss
and
drawings
disappeared
in
the
fortunes
of

and
one
half
of
his
life

thus
disappeared
this
makes
me
feverish
living
as
i
do
in

again
all
malpighi

similar
calamity

out
in

unpublished

perished
a
more
modern
and
more
tragic
example
i
found
recently
in
the
person
of
an
australian
naturalist
walter
stimpson
who
lost
all
his
drawings
and
collections
in
the
great
fire
of

and
was
so
excoriated
by
this
irreparable
misfortune
that
he
never
recovered
from
the
shock
and
died

following
year

broken

and
then
pressing
off
a

be
kept
in
another
and
separate
locality
my
own
precautions
for
these
journals
are
more
elaborate
those
who
know
about
it
think
i
am
mad
i
wonder
but
i
dare
say
i
am
a
pathetic
fool
an
incredible
anyhow
the
coffin
of
raw
material
i
sent
down
to
t
while
i
retain
the
two
current
volumes
this
is
to
avoid
zeppelins
e
took
the
coffin
down
for
me
on
her
way
home
from
school
and
at
taunton
inquisitive
porters
mistaking
it
i
suppose
for
an
infant
coffin
carried
it
reverently
outside
the
station
and
laid
it
down
she
caught
them
looking
at
it
just
in
time
before
her
train
left
under
her
instructions
they
seized
it
by
the
brass
handles
and
carried
it
back
again
i
sit
now
and
with
a
good
deal
of
curiosity
fondle
the
idea
of
porters
carrying
about
my
journals
of
confession
it
like
being
tickled
in
the
palm
of
the
hand
two
volumes
of
abstracted
entries
i
keep
here
and
as
soon
as
i
am
married
i
intend
to
make
a
second
copy
of
these
then
all
in
god
good
time
i
intend
getting
a
volume
ready
for
publication
to
the
queen
hall
and
heard
beethoven
fifth
and
seventh
symphonies
before
the
concert
began
i
was
in
a
fever
i
kept
on
saying
to
myself
i
am
going
to
hear
the
fifth
and
seventh
symphonies
i
regarded
myself
with
the
most
ridiculous
i
smoothed
and
purred
over
myself
a
great
contented
tabby
cat
and
all
because
i
was
so
splendidly
fortunate
as
to
be
about
to
hear
beethoven
fifth
and
seventh
symphonies
it
certainly
upset
me
a
little
to
find
there
were
so
many
other
people
who
were
singularly
fortunate
as
well
and
it
upset
me
still
more
to
find
some
of
them
knitting
and
some
reading
newspapers
as
if
they
waited
for
sausage
and
mashed
how
i
gloried
in
the
seventh
i
ca
believe
there
was
any
one
present
who
gloried
in
it
as
i
did
to
be
processing
majestically
up
the
steps
of
a
great
an
unimaginable
palace
in
the
staircase
introduction
led
by
sir
henry
is
to
have
had
at
least
a
crowded
ten
minutes
of
glorious
life
a
suspicion
crossed
the
mind
at
one
time
good
heavens
they
going
to
knight
me
i
can
not
say
if
that
were
their
intentions
but
i
escaped
however
i
love
the
way
in
which
a
beautiful
melody
flits
around
the
orchestra
and
its
various
components
like
a
beautiful
bird
average
after
a
morning
of
very
mixed
emotions
and
more
than
one
annoyance
at
last
sat
down
to
lunch
and
a
little
peace
and
quiet
with
r
we
began
by
quoting
verse
at
one
another
in
open
competition
of
course
neither
of
us
listened
to
the
other
verses
we
merely
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
recollecting
and
repeating
our
own
i
began
with
tom
row
gently
here
my
gondolier
r
guessed
the
author
rightly
at
once
and
fidgeted
until
he
burst
out
with
the
breaths
of
kissing
night
and
day
to
me
an
easy
one
i
gave
the
moon
more
indolently
sleeps
baudelaire
and
in
reply
he
did
a
great
stroke
by
reciting
some
of
the
old
french
of
frangois
villon
which
entirely
flummuxed
me
i
do
believe
we
really
love
each
other
but
we
cling
to
each
other
out
of
ennui
and
discover
in
each
other
a
certain
cold
intellectual
sympathy
at
the
pay
desk
lyons
is
our
rendezvous
we
joked
with
the
cashier
a
cheerful
fat
little
girl
who
said
to
r
indicating
me
he
a
funny
boy
is
he
dangerous
chirped
r
and
we
laughed
in
the
street
we
met
an
aged
decrepit
newsvendor
very
dirty
and
ragged
but
his
voice
was
unexpectedly
fruity
british
success
he
called
and
we
stopped
for
the
sake
of
the
voice
i
not
interested
i
said
as
an
appetiser
what
not
just
one
sir
i
have
sold
a
single
copy
yet
and
a
wife
and
four
children
that
nothing
to
me
i
three
wives
and
forty
children
i
remarked
what
in
affected
surprise
turning
to
r
he
brigham
young
from
salt
lake
city
yes
i
know
it
i
been
there
myself
and
been
dry
ever
since
give
us
a
drink
sir
just
one
in
consideration
of
his
voice
we
gave
him
and
passed
on
after
giving
a
light
to
a
belgian
soldier
whose
cigarette
had
gone
out
farther
along
we
entered
a
queer
old
music
shop
where
they
sell
flageolets
serpents
clavichords
and
harps
we
had
previously
made
an
appointment
with
the
man
to
have
schubert
unfinished
symphony
played
to
us
so
as
to
recall
one
or
two
of
the
melodies
which
we
ca
recall
and
it
drives
us
crazy
what
is
that
one
in
the
second
movement
which
goes
like
this
and
r
whistled
a
fragment
i
do
know
i
said
but
let
go
in
here
and
ask
in
the
shop
a
youth
was
kind
enough
to
say
that
if
we
cared
to
call
next
day
madame
a
the
harp
player
would
be
home
and
would
be
ready
to
play
us
the
symphony
so
this
morning
before
madame
appearance
this
kind
and
obliging
youth
put
a
gramophone
record
of
it
on
to
which
we
listened
like
two
intelligent
parrots
with
heads
sideways
presently
the
fat
lady
harpist
appeared
and
asked
us
just
what
we
wanted
to
find
out
a
rather
awkward
question
for
us
as
we
did
not
want
to
find
out
anything
excepting
how
the
tunes
went
i
therefore
explained
that
as
neither
of
us
had
sisters
or
wives
and
we
both
wanted
etc
so
would
she
in
response
she
smiled
pleasantly
and
played
us
the
second
movement
on
a
shop
piano
meanwhile
henry
the
boy
hid
himself
behind
the
instruments
at
the
rear
of
the
shop
and
as
we
signed
to
her
she
would
say
what
that
henry
and
henry
would
duly
answer
from
his
obscurity
wood
wind
or
solo
oboe
or
whatever
it
was
and
the
lad
really
spoke
with
authority
in
this
way
i
began
to
find
out
something
about
the
work
before
i
left
i
presented
her
with
a
copy
of
the
score
which
she
did
not
possess
and
because
she
would
not
accept
any
sort
of
remuneration
wo
you
put
your
name
on
it
she
inquired
i
pointed
gaily
to
the
words
ecce
homo
which
i
had
scribbled
across
schubert
name
and
said
there
you
are
madame
smiled
incredulously
and
we
said
it
was
a
beautifully
clement
almost
springlike
day
and
at
the
street
corner
in
a
burst
of
joyousness
we
each
bought
a
bunch
of
violets
of
an
old
woman
stuck
them
on
the
ends
of
our
and
marched
off
with
them
in
triumphant
protest
to
the
carried
over
our
shoulders
our
flowers
amused
the
police
and
who
scarcely
realised
the
significance
of
the
ritual
this
is
my
protest
said
r
against
the
war
it
like
oscar
wilde
sunflower
on
the
way
we
were
both
bitterly
disappointed
at
a
dramatic
meeting
between
a
man
and
woman
of
the
artizan
class
which
instead
of
beginning
with
a
stormy
robert
where
the
rent
may
i
ask
fizzled
out
into
hullo
charlie
why
you
a
stranger
at
tea
in
the
shop
we
had
a
violent
discussion
on
socialism
and
on
the
station
platform
going
home
i
said
that
before
marriage
i
intended
saving
up
against
the
possibility
of
divorce
a
domestic
divorce
fund
very
dreadful
said
r
with
mock
gravity
to
hear
a
recently
affianced
young
man
talk
like
that
what
should
i
do
then
marry
i
suppose
so
shadows
of
the
at
first
i
said
i
ought
not
to
marry
for
two
years
then
when
i
am
wildly
excited
with
her
i
say
next
week
we
could
there
are
no
arrangements
to
be
made
all
her
furniture
flat
etc
but
i
feel
we
ought
to
wait
until
the
war
is
over
at
i
was
feverish
to
do
three
things
at
once
write
out
my
day
journal
eat
my
food
and
read
the
of
marie
bashkirtseff
did
all
three
but
unfortunately
not
at
once
so
that
when
i
was
occupied
with
one
i
would
surreptitiously
cast
a
glance
sideways
at
the
other
and
repined
after
dinner
paid
a
visit
to
the
and
found
playing
patience
i
told
her
that
lives
had
been
lost
in
the
great
italian
earthquake
still
going
on
dealing
out
the
cards
she
said
in
her
gentle
voice
that
that
was
dreadful
and
still
absorbed
in
her
cards
inquired
if
earthquakes
had
aught
to
do
with
the
weather
an
earthquake
must
be
a
dreadful
thing
she
gently
piped
as
she
abstractedly
dealt
out
the
cards
for
a
new
game
in
a
pretty
room
in
kensington
a
public
the
timorous
man
presently
took
out
his
and
was
going
to
take
out
a
cigarette
when
he
recollected
that
he
ought
first
to
offer
one
to
the
millionaire
on
his
right
fortunately
the
cigarette
case
was
silver
and
the
cigarettes
appeared
from
my
side
of
the
to
be
fat
egyptians
yet
the
timorous
and
unassuming
hesitated
palpably
ought
he
to
offer
his
cigarettes
he
thought
of
his
own
balance
at
the
bank
and
then
of
the
millionaire
and
trembled
the
case
after
all
was
only
silver
and
the
cigarettes
were
not
much
more
than
a
halfpenny
each
was
it
not
impertinent
he
sat
a
moment
studying
the
open
case
which
he
held
in
both
hands
like
a
hymn
book
while
the
millionaire
ordered
not
wines
but
a
bass
at
last
courage
came
and
he
inoffensively
pushed
the
cigarettes
towards
his
friend
no
thanks
smiled
the
millionaire
i
do
smoke
and
so
was
a
unicorn
dilemma
after
all
spent
xmas
week
at
work
in
her
studio
transcribing
my
journals
while
she
made
drawings
all
unbeknown
to
her
i
was
copying
out
entries
of
days
gone
by
how
scandalised
she
would
be
if
what
an
amazing
masque
is
rotten
row
on
a
sunday
morning
i
sat
on
a
seat
there
this
morning
and
watched
awhile
it
was
most
exasperating
to
be
in
this
kaleidoscope
of
human
life
without
the
slightest
idea
as
to
who
they
all
were
one
man
in
particular
i
noticed
a
swell
whom
i
wanted
to
touch
gently
on
the
arm
slip
a
into
his
hand
and
whisper
there
tell
me
all
about
yourself
such
swells
there
were
that
out
in
the
fairway
my
little
boat
was
wellnigh
swamped
to
be
in
the
wake
of
a
really
magnificent
duchess
simply
rocks
a
small
boat
in
an
alarming
fashion
i
leaned
over
my
paddles
and
gazed
up
they
steamed
past
unheeding
but
i
kept
my
nerve
all
right
and
pulled
in
and
out
quizzing
and
observing
it
is
nothing
less
than
scandalous
that
here
i
am
aged
with
no
means
of
acquainting
myself
with
contemporary
men
and
women
even
of
my
own
rank
and
station
the
worst
of
it
is
too
that
i
have
no
time
to
lose
in
my
state
of
health
this
accursed
cuts
me
off
from
everything
i
make
pitiful
attempts
to
see
the
world
around
me
by
an
occasional
visit
wind
weather
and
health
permitting
to
petticoat
lane
the
docks
rotten
row
leicester
square
or
the
ethical
church
i
purpose
going
to
the
christian
scientists
meanwhile
the
others
participate
in
armageddon
for
lice
at
the
the
other
day
went
to
the
zoological
gardens
and
by
permission
of
the
secretary
went
round
with
the
keepers
and
searched
the
animals
for
ectoparasites
some
time
this
year
i
have
to
make
a
scientific
report
to
the
zoological
society
upon
all
the
lice
which
from
time
to
time
have
been
collected
on
animals
dying
in
the
gardens
and
sent
me
for
study
and
determination
we
entered
the
cages
caught
and
examined
several
tinamous
and
many
more
to
the
tune
of
the
holiday
whistled
by
a
mynah
it
was
great
fun
then
we
went
into
the
ostrich
house
and
thoroughly
searched
two
kiwis
these
being
nocturnal
birds
were
roosting
underneath
a
heap
of
straw
when
we
had
finished
investigating
their
feathers
they
ran
back
to
their
straw
at
once
the
keeper
giving
them
a
friendly
tap
on
the
rear
to
hurry
them
up
a
bit
they
are
just
like
little
old
women
bundling
along
the
penguins
of
course
were
the
most
amusing
and
after
operating
fruitlessly
for
some
time
on
a
troublesome
adèle
i
was
amused
to
find
on
turning
around
all
the
other
adèles
clustered
close
around
my
feet
in
an
attitude
of
mute
supplication
the
armadillo
required
all
the
strength
of
two
keepers
to
hold
still
while
i
went
over
his
carcass
with
lens
and
forceps
i
was
also
allowed
to
handle
and
examine
the
society
two
specimens
of
that
amazing
creature
the
like
other
royalty
had
to
be
approached
decorously
he
was
a
big
fellow
and
quite
unmanageable
except
by
one
keeper
for
whom
he
showed
a
preference
while
we
other
conspirators
hid
ourselves
outside
this
man
entered
the
house
quietly
and
approached
the
bird
with
a
gentle
cooing
sound
then
suddenly
he
grabbed
the
bill
and
held
on
we
entered
at
the
same
moment
and
secured
the
wings
and
i
began
the
search
without
any
luck
we
must
have
made
an
amusing
picture
three
men
holding
on
for
dear
life
to
a
tall
grotesque
bird
with
an
imperial
eye
while
a
fourth
searched
the
feathers
for
parasites
what
a
boon
is
sunday
i
can
get
out
of
bed
just
when
the
spirit
moves
me
dress
and
bath
leisurely
even
with
punctilio
how
nice
to
dawdle
in
the
bath
with
a
cigarette
to
hear
the
holiday
sound
of
church
bells
then
comes
that
supreme
moment
when
shaven
clean
warm
and
hungry
for
breakfast
and
coffee
i
stand
a
moment
before
the
and
comb
out
my
towzled
hair
with
a
parting
as
straight
as
a
line
in
euclid
that
gives
the
finishing
touch
of
and
i
go
down
to
breakfast
ready
for
the
day
pleasure
i
hate
this
weekday
strain
of
having
to
be
always
each
day
at
a
set
time
in
a
certain
place
i
often
sit
in
my
room
at
the
and
look
out
at
the
traffic
with
a
glassy
mesmerised
face
a
fainéant
how
different
from
that
extremely
busy
youth
who
came
to
london
in
say
could
that
lad
be
i
how
many
hours
do
i
waste
this
morning
i
dreamed
and
dreamed
and
could
not
stop
dreaming
i
had
not
the
will
to
shake
myself
down
to
my
task
my
memories
simply
trooped
the
colour
it
surprised
me
to
find
how
many
of
them
had
gone
out
of
my
present
consciousness
and
with
what
poignancy
of
feeling
i
recognised
them
again
how
selfishly
for
the
most
part
we
all
live
in
our
present
selves
or
in
the
selves
that
are
to
be
then
i
raced
thro
all
sorts
of
future
possibilities
oh
when
and
how
is
it
all
going
to
end
how
do
you
expect
me
to
settle
down
to
scientific
research
with
all
this
internal
unrest
the
scientific
man
above
all
should
possess
the
quiet
mind
in
all
changes
of
fortune
sir
henry
wotton
happy
is
he
born
and
the
truth
is
i
am
a
hybrid
a
mixture
of
two
very
distinct
temperaments
and
they
are
often
at
war
to
keep
two
different
natures
and
two
different
mental
habits
simultaneously
at
work
is
next
to
impossible
consequently
plenty
of
waste
and
fever
and
as
i
might
have
discovered
earlier
for
myself
success
almost
out
of
the
question
if
only
i
were
science
or
art
life
is
a
dream
and
we
are
all
somnambuloes
we
know
that
for
a
fact
at
all
times
when
we
are
most
intensely
alive
at
crises
of
unprecedented
change
in
sorrow
or
catastrophe
or
in
any
unusual
incident
brought
swiftly
to
a
close
like
a
vision
i
sit
here
writing
this
a
mirage
who
am
i
no
one
can
say
what
am
i
a
hanging
from
a
reed
every
man
is
an
inexhaustible
treasury
of
human
personality
he
can
go
on
burrowing
in
it
for
an
eternity
if
he
have
the
desire
and
a
taste
for
introspection
i
like
to
keep
myself
well
within
the
field
of
the
microscope
and
with
as
much
detachment
as
i
can
muster
to
watch
myself
live
to
report
my
observations
of
what
i
say
feel
think
in
default
of
others
i
am
myself
my
own
spectator
and
critical
discerning
vigilant
fond
my
own
stupid
boswell
shrewd
if
silly
this
spectator
of
mine
it
seems
to
me
must
be
a
very
moral
gentleman
and
eminently
superior
his
incessant
attentions
while
i
go
on
my
way
misconducting
myself
goad
me
at
times
into
a
surly
outbreak
like
johnson
i
hate
being
shadowed
and
reported
like
this
yet
on
the
whole
like
old
samuel
again
i
am
rather
pleased
to
be
boswelled
it
flatters
me
to
know
that
at
least
one
person
takes
an
unremitting
interest
in
all
my
ways
and
mind
you
there
are
people
who
have
seen
most
things
but
have
never
seen
themselves
walking
across
the
stage
of
life
if
someone
shows
them
glimpses
of
themselves
they
will
not
recognise
the
likeness
how
do
you
walk
do
you
know
your
own
idiosyncrasies
of
gait
manner
of
speech
i
never
cease
to
interest
myself
in
the
gothic
architecture
of
my
own
fantastic
soul
punch
and
judy
spent
a
most
delightful
reading
an
account
in
the
one
of
my
favourite
books
it
so
gey
disconnekkit
the
history
of
the
punch
and
judy
show
it
a
delightful
bit
of
antiquarian
lore
and
delighted
me
the
more
because
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
before
that
it
had
an
ancient
history
i
am
thoroughly
proud
of
this
recent
acquisition
of
knowledge
and
as
if
it
were
a
valuable
freehold
i
have
been
showing
it
off
saying
rejoice
with
me
see
what
i
have
got
here
i
fired
it
off
first
in
detail
at
and
h
and
d
will
probably
be
my
victims
after
all
it
is
a
charming
little
cameo
of
history
compact
with
plenty
of
scope
for
conjecture
theory
research
and
just
that
combination
of
all
three
which
would
suit
my
taste
and
capacity
if
i
had
time
for
a
monograph
i
waste
much
time
gaping
and
wondering
during
a
walk
or
in
a
book
or
in
the
middle
of
an
embrace
suddenly
i
awake
to
a
stark
amazement
at
everything
the
bare
fact
of
existence
paralyses
me
holds
my
mind
in
to
be
alive
is
so
incredible
that
all
i
do
is
to
lie
still
and
merely
breathe
like
an
infant
on
its
back
in
a
cot
it
is
impossible
to
be
interested
in
anything
in
particular
while
overhead
the
sun
shines
or
underneath
my
feet
grows
a
single
blade
of
grass
the
things
immediate
to
be
done
says
thoreau
i
could
give
them
all
up
to
hear
this
locust
sing
all
my
energies
become
immobilised
even
my
frustrated
i
could
not
exactly
master
and
describe
how
i
feel
during
such
moments
i
expect
we
have
all
of
us
at
one
time
or
another
heard
ourselves
addressing
to
annoying
objectionable
acquaintances
some
such
stinging
castigation
as
hazlitt
letter
to
gifford
or
burke
letter
to
a
noble
lord
or
johnson
letter
to
lord
chesterfield
or
rousseau
letter
to
the
archbishop
of
paris
if
only
i
could
indulge
myself
at
this
moment
i
could
glut
my
rancours
on
six
different
persons
at
least
what
a
raging
discontent
i
have
suffered
what
cynicism
what
bitterness
of
spirit
what
envy
hate
exasperation
childish
petulance
what
pusillanimous
feelings
and
desires
what
crude
efforts
to
flout
simple
ingenuous
folk
with
my
own
thwarted
repressed
a
solemn
fellow
told
me
he
had
heard
from
johnson
who
said
he
had
already
had
much
success
from
collecting
in
moss
with
an
icy
politeness
i
asked
who
johnson
was
who
the
hell
is
johnson
as
a
pro
i
began
to
talk
of
yves
delage
which
left
him
as
much
in
the
dark
as
he
left
me
our
gods
differ
we
have
a
different
hierarchy
well
how
your
soul
said
r
bursting
in
with
a
sardonic
smile
i
gave
him
a
despairing
look
and
said
oh
a
pink
one
with
blue
spots
and
he
left
me
to
my
fate
had
tea
with
the
and
was
amazed
to
find
on
the
music
tray
in
the
of
these
inoffensive
artists
a
copy
of
memoir
on
within
his
hearing
i
said
did
you
and
find
this
exciting
reading
and
i
held
it
up
with
a
sneer
i
felt
i
had
laid
bare
a
nerve
and
forthwith
proceeded
to
make
it
twinge
of
course
was
glib
with
an
explanation
yet
the
question
remains
incalculable
just
how
pleased
that
young
man
is
with
himself
after
tea
went
out
into
the
studio
and
watched
these
two
enthusiasts
paint
i
must
have
glowered
at
them
i
the
energetic
ambitious
pushing
youth
of
necessity
sitting
down
doing
nought
as
unconsidered
as
a
child
playing
on
the
floor
i
recollected
my
early
days
in
my
attic
laboratory
and
sighed
where
is
my
energy
now
plays
chopin
divinely
well
how
i
envied
this
man
to
have
a
wife
play
you
chopin
it
is
fortunate
i
am
ill
in
one
way
for
i
need
not
make
my
mind
up
about
this
war
i
am
not
interested
in
it
this
filth
and
lunacy
i
have
not
yet
made
up
my
mind
about
myself
i
am
so
steeped
in
myself
in
my
moods
vapours
idiosyncrasies
so
that
i
am
unable
to
stand
clear
of
the
data
to
marshal
and
classify
the
multitude
of
facts
and
thence
draw
the
deduction
what
manner
of
man
i
am
i
should
like
to
know
if
only
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
so
what
in
god
name
am
i
a
fool
of
course
to
start
with
but
the
rest
of
the
diagnosis
one
feature
is
my
incredible
levity
about
serious
matters
nothing
matters
provided
the
tongue
is
not
furred
i
have
coquetted
with
death
for
so
long
now
and
endured
such
prodigious
that
my
main
idea
when
in
a
fair
state
of
repair
is
to
seize
the
passing
moment
and
squeeze
it
dry
the
thing
that
counts
is
to
be
drunken
as
baudelaire
says
one
must
be
for
ever
drunken
that
is
the
sole
question
of
importance
if
you
would
not
feel
the
horrible
burden
of
time
that
bruises
your
shoulders
and
bends
you
to
the
earth
you
must
be
drunken
without
cease
another
feature
is
my
insatiable
curiosity
my
purpose
is
to
move
about
in
this
ramshackle
old
curiosity
shop
of
a
world
sampling
existence
i
would
try
everything
meddle
lightly
with
everything
religions
and
philosophies
i
devour
with
a
relish
pragmatism
and
bishop
berkeley
and
bergson
have
been
my
favourite
bagatelles
in
turn
my
consciousness
is
a
ragbag
of
things
all
quips
quirks
and
quillets
all
excellent
passes
of
pate
all
the
obsolete
curiosities
of
an
antiquated
cabinet
take
my
eye
for
a
moment
ere
i
pass
on
in
sir
thomas
browne
i
am
interested
to
find
why
jews
do
not
stink
what
is
the
superstition
of
sneezing
after
saluting
wherefore
negroes
are
black
and
so
forth
there
is
a
poetic
appropriateness
that
in
i
should
be
occupied
mainly
in
the
study
of
lice
i
like
the
insolence
of
it
they
tell
me
that
if
the
germans
won
it
would
put
back
the
clock
of
civilisation
for
a
century
but
what
is
a
meagre
years
consider
the
date
of
the
first
egyptian
dynasty
we
are
now
only
in
surely
we
could
afford
to
chuck
away
a
century
or
two
why
not
evacuate
the
whole
globe
and
give
the
ball
to
the
boches
to
play
with
just
as
an
experiment
to
see
what
they
can
make
of
it
after
all
there
is
no
desperate
hurry
have
we
a
train
to
catch
before
i
could
be
serious
enough
to
fight
i
should
want
god
first
to
dictate
to
me
his
programme
of
the
future
of
mankind
often
in
the
middle
of
a
quite
vivid
ten
seconds
of
life
i
find
i
have
switched
myself
off
from
myself
to
make
room
for
the
person
of
a
disinterested
and
usually
vulgar
spectator
even
in
the
thrill
of
a
devotional
kiss
i
have
overheard
myself
saying
hot
stuff
this
witch
or
in
a
room
full
of
agreeable
and
pleasant
people
while
i
am
being
as
agreeable
as
i
know
how
comes
the
whisper
in
a
cynical
tone
these
damned
women
i
am
apparently
a
triple
personality
the
respectable
youth
the
commentator
and
critic
the
real
but
unknown
i
curious
that
these
three
should
live
together
amiably
in
the
same
tenement
a
a
crowd
makes
egotists
of
us
all
most
men
find
it
repugnant
to
them
to
submerge
themselves
in
a
sea
of
their
fellows
a
silent
listening
crowd
is
potentially
full
of
commotion
some
poor
devils
suffocating
and
unable
any
longer
to
bear
the
strain
will
shout
bravo
or
hear
hear
at
every
opportunity
at
the
feeblest
joke
we
all
laugh
loudly
welcoming
this
means
of
hence
the
success
of
the
salvation
army
to
be
preached
at
and
prayed
for
in
the
mass
for
long
on
end
is
what
human
nature
ca
endure
in
silence
and
a
good
deal
of
self
can
be
smuggled
by
an
experienced
salvationist
into
alleluia
or
the
lord
be
praised
i
had
to
determine
the
names
of
some
exotic
cockroaches
and
finding
it
very
difficult
and
dull
raised
a
weak
smile
in
two
enthusiasts
who
know
them
as
blattids
by
rechristening
them
with
great
frivolity
fat
these
bloody
insects
i
said
to
an
australian
entomologist
of
rare
quality
a
good
round
oath
he
answered
quietly
if
it
was
a
square
one
it
would
roll
properly
i
said
it
is
nice
to
find
an
entomologist
with
whom
i
can
swear
and
talk
bawdy
test
of
the
true
test
of
happiness
is
whether
you
know
what
day
of
the
week
it
is
a
miserable
man
is
aware
of
this
even
in
his
sleep
to
be
as
cheerful
and
on
monday
as
on
saturday
and
at
breakfast
as
at
dinner
is
to
well
make
an
ideal
husband
it
is
a
strange
metempsychosis
this
transformation
of
an
enthusiast
tense
excitable
and
active
into
a
sceptic
nerveless
ironical
and
idle
that
what
can
do
for
a
man
to
be
among
enthusiasts
zoologists
geologists
entomologists
as
i
frequently
am
makes
me
feel
a
very
old
man
regarding
them
as
children
and
provokes
painful
retrospection
and
sugary
sentimentality
over
my
past
flame
now
burnt
out
i
do
wonder
where
i
shall
end
up
what
shall
i
be
twenty
years
hence
it
alarms
me
to
find
i
am
capable
of
such
remarkable
changes
in
character
i
am
fluid
and
can
be
poured
into
any
mould
i
have
moments
when
i
see
in
myself
the
most
staggering
possibilities
i
could
become
a
wife
beater
and
a
especially
the
last
my
curiosity
is
often
such
a
ridiculous
weakness
that
i
have
found
myself
playing
peeping
tom
and
even
spying
into
private
documents
in
a
railway
carriage
i
will
twist
my
neck
and
risk
any
rudeness
to
see
the
title
of
the
book
my
neighbour
is
reading
or
how
the
letter
she
is
reading
begins
why
asks
samuel
butler
should
not
chicken
be
born
and
clergymen
be
laid
and
hatched
or
why
at
any
rate
should
not
the
clergyman
be
born
full
grown
and
in
holy
orders
not
to
say
already
beneficed
the
present
arrangement
is
not
convenient
it
is
not
only
not
perfect
but
so
much
the
reverse
that
we
could
hardly
find
words
to
express
our
sense
of
its
awkwardness
if
we
could
look
upon
it
with
new
eyes
as
soon
as
we
are
born
if
we
could
but
get
up
bathe
dress
shave
breakfast
once
for
all
if
we
could
cut
these
monotonous
cycles
of
routine
if
once
the
sun
rose
it
would
stay
up
or
once
we
were
alive
we
were
immortal
how
much
forrarder
we
should
all
get
always
at
the
heart
of
things
working
without
let
or
hindrance
in
a
straight
line
for
the
millennium
now
we
waltz
along
instead
even
planets
die
off
and
new
ones
come
in
their
place
how
infinitely
wearisome
it
seems
when
an
old
man
dies
what
a
waste
and
when
a
baby
is
born
what
a
redundancy
of
labour
in
front
people
i
hate
in
the
man
walking
along
the
pavement
in
front
of
me
giving
me
no
room
to
pass
under
the
satisfactory
impression
that
he
is
the
only
being
on
the
pavement
or
in
the
street
city
country
world
universe
and
it
all
belongs
to
him
even
the
moon
and
sun
and
stars
the
woman
on
the
the
other
night
pouring
out
an
interminable
flow
of
poisonous
chatter
into
the
ear
of
her
man
poor
exhausted
devil
who
kept
answering
dreamily
oom
and
yes
and
oom
how
i
hated
her
for
his
sake
fifth
if
music
moves
me
it
always
generates
images
a
procession
of
apparently
disconnected
images
in
my
mind
in
the
fifth
symphony
for
example
as
soon
as
the
first
four
notes
are
sounded
and
repeated
this
magic
population
springs
spontaneously
into
being
a
nude
figure
in
headlong
flight
with
hands
pressed
to
the
ears
and
arms
bent
at
the
elbows
a
staring
such
as
one
sees
in
raemakers
cartoons
of
the
belgian
atrocities
a
man
in
the
first
onset
of
mental
agony
on
hearing
sentence
of
death
passed
upon
him
a
wounded
bird
fluttering
and
flopping
in
the
grass
it
is
the
struggle
of
a
man
with
a
fate
as
tho
thro
the
walls
of
a
closed
room
some
mysterious
room
a
fearful
spot
i
crouch
and
listen
and
am
conscious
that
inside
some
brutal
punishment
is
being
meted
out
there
are
short
intervals
then
unrelenting
pursuit
then
hammerlike
blows
melodramatic
thuds
terrible
silences
i
crouch
and
wonder
what
has
happened
and
the
pursuit
begins
again
i
see
clasped
hands
and
appealing
eyes
and
feel
very
helpless
and
mystified
outside
an
epileptic
vision
or
an
opium
dream
or
de
quincey
set
to
music
in
the
second
movement
the
man
is
broken
an
unrecognisable
vomit
i
see
a
pale
youth
sitting
with
arms
hanging
limply
between
the
knees
hands
folded
and
with
sad
impenetrable
eyes
that
have
gazed
on
unspeakable
horrors
i
see
the
brave
tearful
smile
the
changed
life
after
personal
catastrophe
the
cross
held
before
closing
eyes
sudden
absences
of
mind
reveries
poignant
retrospects
the
rustle
of
a
dead
leaf
of
thought
at
the
bottom
of
the
heart
the
tortuous
pursuit
of
past
incidents
down
into
the
silence
of
yesterday
the
droning
of
comfortable
words
the
painful
collection
of
the
wreckage
of
a
life
with
intent
to
carry
on
for
a
while
in
duty
bound
for
the
widow
consolation
in
the
child
a
greyhound
cold
wet
nose
nozzling
into
a
listless
hand
and
outside
a
thrush
singing
after
the
storm
etc
in
the
third
movement
comes
the
crash
by
which
i
know
something
final
and
dreadful
has
happened
then
the
resurrection
with
commotion
in
heaven
tempests
and
human
faces
scurryings
to
and
fro
brazen
portcullises
clanging
to
never
to
open
more
the
distant
roll
of
drums
and
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
from
behind
the
inmost
veil
of
heaven
i
faintly
catch
the
huzzas
of
a
great
multitude
then
comes
a
great
healing
wind
then
a
few
tappings
on
the
window
pane
till
gradually
the
avenue
of
arches
into
heaven
come
into
view
with
a
solemn
cortege
advancing
slowly
along
above
the
great
groundswell
of
woe
hope
is
restored
and
the
unknown
hero
enters
with
all
pomp
into
his
kingdom
etc
i
am
not
surprised
to
learn
that
beethoven
was
once
on
the
verge
of
suicide
there
is
an
absurd
fellow
who
insists
on
taking
my
pirouettes
seriously
i
say
irresponsibly
all
men
are
liars
and
he
replies
with
jejuneness
and
exactitude
of
a
pronouncing
dictionary
a
liar
is
one
who
makes
a
false
statement
with
intent
to
deceive
what
can
i
do
with
him
did
i
ever
meet
a
lady
he
asked
who
was
afraid
of
mice
i
do
know
i
told
him
i
never
experiment
with
ladies
in
that
way
he
hates
me
this
mysterious
world
makes
me
chilly
it
is
chilly
to
be
alive
among
ghosts
in
a
nightmare
of
calamity
this
titanic
war
reduces
me
to
the
size
and
importance
of
a
debilitated
housefly
so
what
is
a
poor
egotist
to
do
to
be
a
common
soldier
is
to
become
a
pawn
in
the
game
between
ambitious
dynasts
and
their
ambitious
marshals
you
lose
all
individuality
you
become
a
bayonet
or
a
machine
gun
or
cannon
fodder
or
fighting
material
generosity
may
be
only
weakness
philanthropy
beautiful
word
and
praise
of
others
sheer
egotism
one
can
almost
hear
a
eulogist
winding
himself
up
to
strike
his
eulogy
that
comes
out
sententious
pompous
and
full
of
self
the
following
is
a
description
of
lermontov
by
maurice
baring
he
had
except
for
a
few
intimate
friends
an
impossible
temperament
he
was
proud
exasperated
and
exasperating
filled
with
a
savage
and
he
took
a
childish
delight
in
annoying
he
cultivated
plaisir
aristocratique
de
déplaire
he
could
not
bear
not
to
make
himself
felt
and
if
he
felt
he
was
unsuccessful
in
this
by
fair
means
he
resorted
to
unpleasant
ones
yet
he
was
thirsting
for
love
and
kindness
and
capable
of
giving
himself
up
to
love
if
he
chose
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
lay
no
doubt
a
disgust
with
himself
and
with
the
world
in
general
and
a
complete
indifference
to
life
resulting
from
large
aspirations
which
could
not
find
an
outlet
and
recoiled
upon
himself
this
is
an
accurate
description
of
me
the
time
will
come
it
a
great
way
off
when
a
joke
about
sex
will
be
not
so
much
objectionable
as
unintelligible
thanks
to
christian
teaching
a
nude
body
is
now
an
obscenity
of
the
congress
of
the
sexes
it
is
indecent
to
speak
and
our
birth
is
a
corruption
hence
come
a
legion
of
evils
reticence
therefore
ignorance
and
therefore
venereal
disease
prurience
especially
in
adolescence
poisonous
literature
and
dirty
jokes
the
mind
is
contaminated
from
early
youth
even
the
girl
will
blush
at
the
mention
of
wonder
of
yet
to
the
perfectly
enfranchised
mind
it
should
be
as
impossible
to
joke
about
sex
as
about
mind
or
digestion
or
physiology
the
perfectly
enfranchised
poet
and
walt
whitman
in
the
song
of
myself
came
near
being
it
should
be
as
ready
to
sing
of
the
incredible
raptures
of
the
sexual
act
between
twin
souls
as
of
the
clouds
or
sunshine
every
man
or
woman
who
has
loved
has
a
heart
full
of
beautiful
things
to
say
but
no
man
dare
for
fear
of
the
police
for
fear
of
the
coarse
jests
of
others
and
even
of
a
breakdown
in
his
own
highmindedness
i
wonder
just
how
much
wonderful
lyric
poetry
has
thus
been
lost
to
the
world
pool
a
from
above
the
pool
looked
like
any
little
innocent
sheet
of
water
but
down
in
the
hollow
itself
it
grew
sinister
the
villagers
used
to
say
and
to
believe
that
it
had
no
bottom
and
certainly
a
very
great
depth
in
it
could
be
if
not
accurately
gauged
as
one
stood
at
the
water
edge
a
long
time
ago
it
was
a
great
limestone
quarry
but
the
large
mounds
of
rubble
on
one
side
of
it
are
covered
with
grass
and
planted
with
mazzard
trees
grown
to
quite
a
large
girth
on
the
other
side
one
is
confronted
by
a
tall
sheet
of
black
carboniferous
rock
rising
sheer
out
of
the
inky
water
a
bare
sombre
surface
on
which
no
mosses
even
tender
creatures
of
pity
ruskin
calls
them
have
taken
compassion
by
softening
the
jagged
edges
of
the
strata
or
nestling
in
the
scars
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
contortion
as
geologists
say
for
the
beds
are
bent
into
a
quite
regular
geometrical
pattern
syncline
and
anticline
in
waves
by
plutonic
force
that
makes
the
mind
quake
in
the
effort
to
imagine
it
on
the
top
of
this
rock
and
overhanging
the
water
a
gaunt
fir
tree
impends
as
it
seems
in
a
perilous
balance
while
down
below
the
pool
sleek
and
shiny
quietly
waits
with
a
catlike
patience
in
summer
time
successive
rows
of
foxgloves
one
behind
the
other
in
barbaric
splendour
are
ranged
around
the
grassy
rubble
slopes
like
spectators
in
an
amphitheatre
awaiting
the
spectacle
efts
slip
here
and
there
lazily
thro
the
water
occasionally
a
would
swim
across
the
pool
and
once
i
caught
one
and
on
opening
his
stomach
found
a
large
eft
inside
the
sun
beats
fiercely
into
this
deep
hollow
and
makes
the
water
tepid
on
the
surface
grows
a
glairy
alga
which
was
once
all
green
but
now
festers
in
yellow
patches
and
causes
a
horrible
stench
everything
is
absolutely
still
air
and
water
are
stagnant
a
large
beetle
rises
to
the
surface
to
breathe
and
every
now
and
then
large
bubbles
of
marsh
gas
come
sailing
majestically
up
from
the
depth
and
explode
quietly
into
the
fetid
air
the
of
this
place
impressed
me
even
when
i
was
intent
only
on
fishing
there
for
bugs
and
efts
now
seen
in
retrospect
it
haunts
me
it
is
only
by
accident
that
certain
of
our
bodily
functions
are
distasteful
many
birds
eat
the
faeces
of
their
young
the
vomits
of
some
owls
are
formed
into
shapely
pellets
often
of
beautiful
appearance
when
composed
of
the
glittering
elytra
of
beetles
etc
the
common
eland
is
known
to
micturate
on
the
tuft
of
hair
on
the
crown
of
its
head
and
it
does
this
habitually
when
lying
down
by
bending
its
head
around
and
down
apparently
because
of
the
aroma
perhaps
of
sexual
importance
during
mating
time
as
it
is
a
habit
of
the
male
alone
at
lunch
time
had
an
unpleasant
intermittency
period
in
my
action
and
this
rather
eclipsed
my
anxiety
over
a
probable
zeppelin
raid
went
home
to
my
rooms
by
and
before
setting
off
to
catch
my
train
for
west
wycombe
to
stay
for
the
at
a
farm
with
e
swallowed
two
teaspoonfuls
of
neat
brandy
filled
my
flask
and
took
a
taxi
to
paddington
at
started
to
walk
to
c
h
farm
from
wycombe
station
where
e
has
been
lodging
for
some
weeks
taking
a
rest
cure
after
a
serious
nervous
breakdown
thro
overwork
as
soon
as
i
stepped
out
of
the
train
i
sniffed
the
fresh
air
and
soon
made
off
down
the
road
happy
to
have
left
london
and
the
winter
and
the
war
far
behind
the
first
man
of
whom
i
inquired
the
way
happened
to
have
been
working
at
the
farm
only
a
few
weeks
ago
so
i
relied
implicitly
on
his
directions
and
as
it
was
but
a
mile
and
a
half
decided
that
my
wobbly
heart
could
stand
the
strain
i
set
out
with
a
good
deal
of
pleasurable
anticipation
i
was
genuinely
looking
forward
to
seeing
e
altho
in
the
past
few
weeks
our
relations
had
become
a
little
strained
at
least
on
my
part
mainly
because
of
her
little
scrappy
notes
to
me
scribbled
in
pencil
undated
and
dull
yet
i
could
do
with
a
volume
of
sonnets
from
the
portuguese
these
letters
chilled
me
in
reply
i
wrote
with
cold
steel
short
lifeless
formal
notes
for
i
felt
genuinely
aggrieved
that
she
should
care
so
little
how
she
wrote
to
me
or
how
she
expressed
her
love
i
became
ironical
with
myself
over
the
prospect
of
marrying
a
girl
who
appeared
so
little
to
appreciate
my
education
and
mental
habits
what
a
popinjay
my
petty
spirit
grew
disenchanted
out
of
love
i
was
false
to
her
in
a
hundred
inconsiderable
little
ways
and
even
deliberately
planned
the
breaking
off
of
the
engagement
some
months
hence
when
she
should
be
restored
to
normal
health
but
once
in
the
country
and
as
i
thought
nearing
my
love
at
every
step
and
at
every
bend
in
the
road
even
anticipating
her
arms
around
me
with
real
pleasure
for
she
promised
to
meet
me
half
way
i
on
a
sudden
grew
eager
for
her
again
and
was
assured
of
a
happy
with
her
then
the
road
grew
puzzling
and
i
became
confused
uncertain
of
the
way
i
began
to
murmur
she
should
have
given
me
instructions
every
now
and
then
i
had
to
stop
and
rest
as
my
heart
was
beating
so
furiously
espying
a
farm
on
the
left
i
made
sure
i
had
arrived
at
my
destination
and
walked
across
a
field
to
it
and
entered
the
yard
where
i
heard
some
one
milking
a
cow
in
a
shed
i
shouted
over
the
gate
into
empty
space
is
this
c
h
farm
a
labourer
came
out
of
the
shed
and
redirected
me
it
was
now
ten
to
five
i
was
tired
and
out
of
sorts
and
carried
a
troublesome
little
handbag
i
swore
and
cursed
and
found
fault
with
e
and
the
universe
i
trudged
on
asking
people
as
i
went
the
way
finally
emerging
from
the
cover
of
a
beautiful
wood
thro
a
wicket
gate
almost
at
the
entrance
to
the
farm
i
sought
at
the
front
door
we
embraced
affectionately
and
we
entered
at
once
i
putting
a
quite
good
face
upon
my
exertions
when
i
consider
my
unbridled
fury
of
a
short
time
before
e
as
brown
as
a
berry
conducted
me
to
my
bedroom
and
i
nearly
forgot
to
take
this
obvious
opportunity
of
kissing
her
again
how
are
you
i
asked
all
right
she
said
fencing
but
really
all
right
a
little
nettled
my
dear
that
is
going
to
satisfy
me
you
will
have
to
tell
me
exactly
how
you
are
after
tea
i
recovered
myself
and
we
went
for
a
walk
together
the
beauty
of
the
country
warmed
me
up
and
in
the
wood
we
kissed
i
for
my
part
happy
and
quite
content
with
the
present
state
of
our
relations
affectionate
but
not
perfervid
got
up
early
and
walked
around
the
farm
before
breakfast
everything
promises
to
be
delightful
young
calves
broods
of
ducklings
and
turkeys
fowls
cats
and
dogs
in
the
yard
are
two
large
cathedral
barns
with
enormous
pent
roofs
sloping
down
to
within
about
two
feet
of
the
ground
and
entered
by
way
of
great
double
doors
that
open
with
the
slowness
and
solemnity
of
a
castle
portal
studded
with
iron
knobs
it
thrilled
me
to
the
marrow
on
first
putting
my
head
outside
to
be
greeted
with
the
grunt
of
an
invisible
pig
that
i
found
scraping
his
back
on
the
other
side
of
the
garden
wall
in
the
afternoon
e
and
i
sat
together
in
the
beech
wood
e
on
a
deck
chair
and
i
on
a
rug
on
the
ground
in
spite
of
our
beautiful
surroundings
we
did
not
progress
very
well
but
i
attributed
her
slight
aloofness
to
the
state
of
her
nerves
she
is
still
far
from
recovered
these
wonderful
beech
woods
are
quite
new
to
me
the
forest
beech
is
a
very
different
plant
from
the
solitary
tree
in
the
struggle
to
reach
the
light
the
forest
beech
grows
lean
and
tall
and
gives
an
extraordinary
suggestion
of
wiry
powerful
strength
on
the
margins
of
the
wood
bluebells
were
mobilised
in
serried
ranks
great
tits
whistled
in
the
language
of
our
allies
bijou
bijou
and
i
agreed
with
every
one
of
them
some
folk
do
like
to
walk
over
bluebells
or
buttercups
or
other
flowers
growing
on
the
ground
but
it
is
foolish
to
try
to
pamper
nature
as
if
she
were
a
sickly
child
she
is
strong
and
can
stand
it
you
can
stamp
on
and
crush
a
thousand
flowers
they
will
all
come
up
again
next
year
by
some
labyrinthine
way
which
i
can
not
now
recall
the
conversation
worked
round
to
a
leading
question
by
if
in
times
like
these
we
ought
not
to
cease
being
in
love
she
was
quite
calm
and
serious
i
said
no
of
course
not
silly
my
immediate
apprehension
was
that
she
had
perceived
the
coldness
in
my
letters
and
i
was
quite
satisfied
that
she
was
so
well
able
to
read
the
signs
in
the
sky
but
you
do
wish
to
go
on
she
persisted
i
persisted
that
i
did
that
i
had
no
misgivings
no
second
thoughts
that
i
was
not
merely
taking
pity
on
her
etc
the
wild
temptation
to
seize
this
opportunity
for
a
break
i
smothered
in
reflecting
how
ill
she
was
and
how
necessary
to
wait
first
till
she
was
well
again
these
thoughts
passed
swiftly
vaguely
like
wraiths
thro
my
mind
i
was
barely
conscious
of
them
then
i
recalled
the
sonnet
about
coming
in
the
rearward
of
a
conquered
woe
and
mused
thereon
but
i
took
no
action
fortunately
for
me
presently
with
cunning
i
said
that
there
was
no
cloud
on
my
horizon
whatever
only
her
letters
disappointed
me
a
little
they
were
so
cold
but
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
again
darling
those
feelings
disappeared
as
soon
as
they
were
spoken
i
knew
they
were
not
as
they
might
seem
the
words
of
a
liar
and
hypocrite
they
true
e
looked
very
sweet
and
helpless
and
i
loved
her
again
as
much
as
ever
it
funny
she
said
but
i
thought
your
letters
were
cold
letters
are
so
horrid
the
incident
shews
how
impossible
is
intellectual
honesty
between
lovers
truth
is
at
times
a
hound
which
must
to
kennel
write
as
you
would
speak
said
i
you
know
i
not
one
to
carp
about
a
spelling
mistake
the
latter
remark
astonished
me
was
it
indeed
i
who
was
speaking
all
the
week
i
had
been
fuming
over
this
yet
i
was
honest
the
sun
and
presence
were
dispelling
my
and
crochets
we
sealed
our
conversation
with
a
kiss
and
swore
never
to
doubt
each
other
again
spell
was
beginning
to
act
it
is
always
the
same
i
can
not
resist
the
actual
presence
of
this
woman
out
of
her
sight
i
can
in
cold
blood
plan
a
brutal
rupture
i
can
pay
her
a
visit
when
the
first
kiss
is
a
duty
and
the
embrace
a
formality
but
after
minutes
i
am
as
passionate
and
devoted
as
before
it
is
always
thus
after
leaving
her
i
am
angry
to
think
that
once
more
i
have
succumbed
in
the
evening
we
went
out
into
a
field
and
sat
together
in
the
grass
it
is
beautiful
we
lay
flat
on
our
backs
and
gazed
up
at
the
sky
has
died
of
enteric
at
malta
in
writing
to
instead
of
dwelling
on
what
a
splendid
fellow
he
was
i
belaboured
the
fact
that
i
still
remembered
our
boyish
friendship
in
every
detail
and
still
kept
his
photo
on
my
mantelpiece
and
altho
in
later
years
i
did
suppose
we
had
a
great
deal
in
common
i
discovered
that
a
friendship
even
between
two
small
boys
can
not
wholly
disappear
into
the
void
discussing
myself
when
i
ought
to
have
been
praising
him
ugh
she
will
think
what
a
conceited
jackanapes
these
phrases
have
rankled
in
my
mind
ever
since
i
dropped
the
letter
into
the
your
stanley
was
of
course
a
very
inferior
sort
of
person
and
naturally
you
could
hardly
expect
me
to
remain
friendly
with
him
but
rest
assured
i
had
forgotten
him
etc
luxury
of
yesterday
i
read
a
paper
at
the
zoological
society
about
lice
there
was
a
goodly
baldness
of
sconce
and
some
considerable
length
of
beard
present
that
listened
or
appeared
to
listen
to
my
innocent
remarks
with
great
solemnity
and
sapience
i
badly
wanted
to
tell
them
some
horrid
stories
about
human
lice
but
i
had
not
the
courage
i
wanted
to
jolt
these
gentlemen
by
performing
a
few
tricks
but
i
am
too
timid
for
such
adventures
but
before
going
to
sleep
i
imagined
a
pandemonium
in
which
with
a
perfectly
glacial
manner
i
produced
lice
alive
from
my
pockets
conjured
them
down
from
the
roof
in
a
rain
with
the
skilful
sleight
of
hand
drew
them
out
of
the
chairman
beard
made
the
ladies
scream
as
i
approached
dared
to
say
they
were
all
lousy
and
unclean
and
finished
up
with
an
eloquent
apostrophe
after
the
manner
of
thomas
de
quincey
and
of
sir
walter
raleigh
before
him
beginning
o
just
subtle
and
eloquent
avenger
pierce
the
hides
of
these
abominable
old
fogies
speckle
their
polished
calvaria
with
the
scarlet
blood
drops
but
i
had
the
courage
shelley
in
a
crowded
omnibus
suddenly
burst
out
o
let
us
sit
upon
the
ground
and
tell
sad
stories
of
the
deaths
of
kings
etc
i
always
wanted
to
do
something
like
that
and
when
i
have
to
spare
i
hope
to
pull
the
communication
cord
of
an
express
train
my
hands
tingle
as
often
as
i
look
at
it
johnson
courage
in
tapping
the
is
really
everyone
envy
tho
we
laugh
at
him
for
it
and
say
that
he
was
mad
in
walking
along
the
pavement
i
sometimes
indulge
myself
in
the
unutterable
deeply
rooted
satisfaction
of
stepping
on
a
separate
flagstone
where
this
is
possible
with
every
stride
and
if
this
is
impossible
or
not
easy
there
arises
in
me
a
vague
mental
uneasiness
some
subconscious
suspicion
that
the
world
is
not
properly
geometrical
and
that
the
whole
universe
perhaps
is
working
out
of
truth
i
am
also
rather
proud
of
my
courageous
to
the
daemon
of
laughter
especially
in
those
early
days
when
and
i
used
to
sit
opposite
one
another
and
howl
like
hyenas
after
the
most
cacophonous
cachinnations
as
soon
as
we
had
recovered
ourselves
he
or
i
would
regularly
remark
in
serious
and
confidential
tones
i
say
we
are
going
mad
but
what
a
delightful
luxury
to
be
thus
mad
amid
the
great
spacious
architectural
solemnity
with
gargoyles
and
effigies
of
a
scientific
meeting
some
people
never
do
more
than
chuckle
or
smile
and
they
are
often
very
humorous
happy
people
ignorant
nevertheless
of
the
joy
of
riding
themselves
on
the
snaffle
and
losing
all
control
while
boating
on
last
summer
we
saw
two
persons
a
man
and
a
girl
sitting
together
on
the
beach
reading
a
book
with
heads
almost
touching
i
wonder
what
they
reading
i
said
and
i
was
dying
to
know
we
made
a
few
facetious
guesses
shall
i
ask
yes
do
said
the
truth
is
we
all
wanted
to
know
we
were
suddenly
mad
with
curiosity
as
we
watched
the
happy
pair
turning
over
leaf
after
leaf
while
r
leaned
on
his
oars
i
stood
up
in
the
boat
and
threatened
to
shout
out
a
polite
enquiry
just
to
prove
that
the
will
is
free
but
seeing
my
intention
the
grew
nervous
and
said
seriously
no
which
unnerved
me
at
the
last
moment
so
i
sat
down
again
why
was
i
so
afraid
of
being
thought
a
lunatic
by
two
persons
in
the
distance
whom
i
had
never
seen
and
probably
would
never
see
again
besides
i
a
lunatic
we
all
were
in
our
perambulations
about
kensington
g
and
i
often
pass
the
window
of
a
photographer
shop
containing
always
a
profusion
of
bare
arms
chests
necks
bosoms
belonging
to
actresses
aristocrats
and
harlots
some
very
beautiful
indeed
yet
on
the
whole
the
window
annoys
us
especially
one
picture
of
a
young
thing
with
an
arum
lily
ghastly
plant
laid
exquisitely
across
her
breast
why
do
we
suffer
this
i
asked
g
tapping
the
window
ledge
as
we
stood
i
do
know
he
answered
lamely
morose
pause
while
the
two
embittered
young
men
continue
to
look
in
and
the
beautiful
young
women
continue
to
look
out
thoroughly
disgruntled
i
said
at
last
if
only
we
had
the
courage
of
our
innate
madness
the
courage
of
children
lunatics
and
men
of
genius
we
should
get
some
stamp
paper
and
stick
a
square
beneath
each
photograph
with
our
comments
baudelaire
describes
how
he
dismissed
a
glass
vendor
because
he
had
no
coloured
glasses
glasses
of
rose
and
crimson
magical
glasses
glasses
of
paradise
and
stepping
out
on
to
his
balcony
threw
a
flowerpot
down
on
the
tray
of
glasses
as
soon
as
the
man
issued
into
the
street
below
shouting
down
furiously
the
life
beautiful
the
life
beautiful
bergson
theory
is
that
laughter
is
a
social
gesture
so
that
when
a
man
in
a
top
hat
treads
on
a
banana
skin
and
slips
down
we
laugh
at
him
for
his
lack
of
living
pliableness
at
this
rate
we
ought
to
be
profoundly
solemn
at
baudelaire
action
and
moreover
a
social
gesture
is
more
likely
to
be
an
expression
of
society
will
to
conformity
in
all
its
members
rather
than
any
dangerous
living
pliableness
society
hates
living
pliableness
and
prefers
drill
routine
orthodoxy
conformity
it
hated
the
living
pliableness
of
turner
of
keats
of
samuel
butler
and
a
hundred
others
but
to
return
to
lunacy
the
truth
is
we
are
all
mad
fundamentally
and
are
merely
schooled
into
sanity
by
education
pascal
wrote
men
are
so
necessarily
mad
that
not
to
be
mad
would
amount
to
another
form
of
madness
and
in
fact
the
man
who
has
succeeded
in
extirpating
this
intoxication
of
life
is
usually
said
to
be
temporarily
insane
in
those
melancholy
interludes
of
sanity
when
the
mind
becomes
rationalised
we
all
know
how
much
we
have
been
deceived
and
gulled
what
an
extraordinary
spectacle
humanity
presents
rushing
on
in
noise
and
tumult
no
one
knows
why
or
whither
look
at
that
tailor
in
his
shop
why
does
he
do
it
some
day
in
the
future
he
thinks
he
will
but
the
day
never
comes
and
he
is
nevertheless
content
a
brilliantly
sunny
day
this
funny
old
where
we
are
staying
quite
delights
me
it
is
pleasant
too
to
dawdle
over
dressing
to
put
away
shaving
tackle
for
a
day
or
so
to
jump
out
of
bed
in
the
morning
and
thrust
my
head
out
of
the
window
into
the
fresh
and
air
of
the
garden
listen
to
the
bird
chorus
or
watch
a
scrap
in
the
then
all
unashamed
i
dress
myself
before
a
dear
old
lady
in
a
flowery
print
gown
concealing
thin
legs
and
over
the
top
of
the
mirror
a
piece
of
lace
just
like
a
bonnet
caught
up
in
front
by
a
piece
of
pink
ribbon
on
the
walls
pear
soap
annuals
on
a
side
table
family
and
of
the
new
then
there
are
rats
under
the
floors
two
wooden
staircases
which
wind
up
out
of
sight
two
white
dairies
iron
hapses
on
all
the
doors
and
a
privy
at
the
top
of
the
orchard
tell
me
how
do
you
explain
the
psychosis
of
a
being
who
on
a
day
must
have
seized
hammer
and
nail
and
an
almanac
picture
of
a
woman
in
the
snow
with
a
basket
of
goodies
an
errand
of
mercy
carried
all
three
to
the
top
of
the
orchard
and
nailed
the
picture
up
on
the
dirty
wall
in
the
of
an
got
up
quite
early
before
breakfast
and
went
it
would
take
too
long
and
be
too
sentimental
for
me
to
record
my
feelings
on
looking
into
the
first
nest
i
found
a
chaffinch
the
first
wild
bird
eggs
i
have
seen
for
many
years
as
i
stood
with
an
egg
between
thumb
and
forefinger
my
memories
flocked
down
like
white
birds
and
surrounded
me
i
remained
still
fed
them
with
my
thoughts
and
let
them
perch
upon
my
person
a
second
francis
of
assisi
then
i
them
all
away
and
prepared
for
the
more
palpitating
enjoyment
of
after
breakfast
we
sat
in
the
buttercup
field
my
love
and
i
and
plucked
up
kisses
by
the
roots
that
grew
upon
our
lips
the
sun
was
streaming
down
and
the
field
thickly
peopled
with
buttercups
from
where
we
sat
we
could
see
the
whole
of
the
valley
below
and
farmer
whaley
a
speck
in
the
distance
working
a
machine
in
a
field
we
watched
him
idly
the
gamekeeper
gun
went
off
in
one
of
the
covers
it
was
jolly
to
put
our
heads
together
right
down
deep
in
the
buttercups
and
luxuriously
follow
the
pelting
activities
of
the
tiny
insects
crawling
here
and
there
in
the
forest
of
grass
clambering
over
a
broken
blade
athwart
another
like
a
wrecked
tree
or
busily
enquiring
into
some
low
scrub
at
the
roots
a
chicken
came
our
way
and
he
seemed
an
enormous
bird
from
the
point
of
view
how
nice
to
be
a
chicken
in
a
field
of
buttercups
and
see
them
as
big
as
sunflowers
or
to
be
a
gulliver
in
the
beech
woods
to
be
so
small
as
to
be
able
to
climb
a
buttercup
tumble
into
the
corolla
and
be
dusted
yellow
or
to
be
so
big
as
to
be
able
to
pull
up
a
with
finger
and
thumb
if
only
a
man
were
a
magician
could
play
fast
and
loose
with
rigid
nature
what
a
multitude
of
rich
experiences
he
could
discover
for
himself
i
looked
long
and
steadily
this
morning
at
the
magnificent
torso
of
a
high
forest
beech
and
tried
to
project
myself
into
its
lithe
form
to
feel
its
electric
sap
vitalising
all
my
frame
out
to
the
tip
of
every
tingling
leaf
to
possess
its
splendid
erectness
in
my
own
bones
i
could
have
flung
my
arms
around
its
fascinating
body
but
the
austerity
of
the
great
creature
forbad
it
then
a
hawk
fired
my
ambition
to
be
a
hawk
or
a
falcon
to
have
a
falcon
soul
a
falcon
heart
that
splendid
muscle
in
the
cage
of
the
thorax
and
the
falcon
pride
and
sagacious
eye
when
the
sun
grew
too
hot
we
went
into
the
wood
where
waves
of
bluebells
dashed
up
around
the
foot
of
the
oak
in
front
of
us
i
never
knew
before
the
delight
of
offering
oneself
up
an
oblation
of
one
whole
being
i
even
longed
for
some
to
have
to
give
up
something
for
her
sake
it
intoxicated
me
to
think
i
was
making
another
happy
after
a
lunch
of
scrambled
eggs
and
rhubarb
and
cream
went
up
into
the
beech
wood
again
and
sat
on
a
rug
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
the
sun
filtered
in
thro
the
greenery
casting
a
dim
religious
light
it
like
a
cathedral
i
chattered
away
stained
glass
windows
pillars
aisles
all
complete
it
would
be
nice
to
be
married
in
a
cathedral
like
this
she
said
at
c
hall
cathedral
by
the
rev
canon
sir
henry
wood
was
the
organist
yes
she
said
and
the
rev
blackbird
the
precentor
we
laughed
over
our
silliness
pattered
over
the
dead
leaves
and
one
came
boldly
into
view
under
a
bramble
bush
she
had
never
seen
one
before
overhead
a
ribald
fellow
of
a
blackbird
whistled
a
jaunty
tune
e
laughed
i
am
sure
that
blackbird
is
laughing
at
us
she
said
it
makes
me
feel
quite
hot
this
evening
we
sat
on
the
slope
of
a
big
field
where
by
lowering
our
eyes
we
could
see
the
sun
setting
behind
the
grass
blades
a
very
pretty
sight
which
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
noted
before
a
large
blue
beetle
was
stumbling
about
culvers
cooed
in
the
woods
near
by
it
was
delightful
to
be
up
feet
on
a
grassy
field
under
the
shadow
of
a
large
wood
at
sunset
with
my
darling
sitting
at
tea
in
the
farm
house
e
cried
suddenly
pointing
to
a
sandy
cat
in
the
garden
there
he
the
father
of
the
little
kittens
in
the
barn
and
i
tell
you
how
we
know
p
noticed
the
kittens
had
big
feet
and
later
on
saw
that
old
tom
stalking
across
the
garden
with
big
feet
of
exactly
the
same
kind
so
you
impute
the
paternity
of
the
kittens
to
the
gentleman
under
the
laurel
bushes
i
looked
at
the
kittens
and
found
they
had
extra
toes
sixtoes
as
w
calls
him
also
possesses
six
toes
so
the
circumstantial
evidence
looks
black
against
him
in
the
beech
wood
all
the
morning
it
grand
to
lie
out
as
straight
as
a
line
on
your
back
gaze
upwards
into
the
tree
above
and
with
a
caressing
eye
follow
its
branches
out
into
their
multitudinous
ramifications
forward
and
back
luxurious
travel
for
the
tired
eye
then
i
would
shut
my
eyes
and
try
to
guess
where
her
next
kiss
would
descend
then
i
opened
my
eyes
and
watched
her
face
in
the
most
extravagant
detail
i
counted
the
little
filaments
on
her
precious
mole
and
saw
the
sun
thro
the
golden
down
of
her
throat
sunlight
and
a
fresh
wind
a
day
of
tiny
cameos
little
fleeting
impressions
snapshotted
on
the
mind
the
glint
on
the
keeper
gun
as
he
crossed
a
field
a
mile
away
below
us
sunlight
all
along
a
silken
hawser
which
some
spider
engineer
had
spun
between
the
tops
of
two
tall
trees
spanning
the
whole
width
of
a
bridle
path
the
constant
patter
of
over
dead
leaves
the
pendulum
of
a
in
a
flower
and
the
just
perceptible
oscillation
of
the
tree
tops
in
the
wind
while
we
are
at
meals
the
perfume
of
lilac
and
stocks
pours
in
thro
the
window
and
when
we
go
to
bed
it
is
still
pouring
in
by
the
open
lattice
each
day
i
drop
a
specially
selected
buttercup
in
past
the
little
peeler
at
the
apex
of
the
v
to
lie
among
the
blue
ribbons
of
her
camisoles
those
dainty
white
leaves
that
wrap
around
her
bosom
like
the
petals
around
the
heart
of
a
rose
then
at
night
when
she
undresses
it
falls
out
and
she
preserves
it
in
the
woods
hearing
an
extra
loud
patter
on
the
leaves
we
turned
our
heads
and
saw
a
frog
hopping
our
way
i
caught
him
and
gave
an
elementary
lesson
in
anatomy
i
described
to
her
the
brain
the
pineal
organ
in
anguis
sphenodon
pineal
eye
etc
then
we
fell
to
kissing
again
every
now
and
then
she
raises
her
head
and
listens
like
a
thrush
on
the
lawn
thinking
she
hears
someone
approach
we
neither
of
us
speak
much
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
nerve
endings
on
my
lips
are
tingling
farmer
whaley
is
a
funny
old
man
with
a
soft
pious
voice
when
he
feeds
the
fowls
he
sucks
in
a
gentle
caressing
noise
between
his
lips
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
fed
them
because
he
loved
them
and
not
because
he
wants
to
fatten
them
up
for
killing
his
daughter
lucy
aged
loves
all
the
animals
of
the
farm
and
they
all
love
her
the
cows
stand
monumentally
still
while
she
strokes
them
down
the
blaze
or
affectionately
waggles
their
dewlaps
this
morning
she
walked
up
to
a
little
calf
in
the
scarce
a
fortnight
old
which
started
to
back
in
a
funny
way
spraddling
out
its
legs
and
lowering
its
head
miss
lucy
laughed
merrily
and
cried
ah
you
funny
little
thing
and
went
off
on
her
way
to
feed
the
fowls
who
all
raced
to
the
gate
as
soon
as
they
heard
her
footsteps
she
brought
in
two
eggs
for
us
to
see
and
marvel
at
in
the
breakfast
room
stands
a
stuffed
collie
dog
in
a
glass
case
i
as
soon
embalm
my
grandmother
and
keep
her
on
the
sideboard
i
asked
young
george
the
what
bird
went
like
this
i
whistled
it
he
looked
abashed
and
said
a
chaffinch
i
told
miss
lucy
who
said
george
was
a
silly
boy
and
miss
lucy
told
farmer
whaley
who
said
george
ought
to
know
better
it
was
a
the
letters
are
brought
us
each
morning
by
a
tramp
with
a
game
leg
who
secretes
his
majesty
mails
in
a
shabby
bowler
hat
the
small
packages
and
parcels
going
to
the
roomy
tail
pocket
of
a
dirty
morning
coat
a
decayed
gentleman
of
much
interest
to
us
we
have
made
a
little
nest
in
the
wood
and
i
lead
her
into
it
by
the
hand
over
the
briars
and
undergrowth
as
if
conducting
her
to
the
grand
piano
on
a
concert
platform
i
kissed
her
then
in
a
second
we
switch
back
to
ordinary
conversation
in
an
ordinary
conversational
voice
i
ask
the
trees
the
birds
the
sky
what
become
of
all
the
gold
what
become
of
waring
what
is
love
is
not
hereafter
where
are
the
snows
of
yesteryear
who
killed
cock
robin
who
who
and
so
on
thro
all
the
great
interrogatives
that
i
could
think
of
till
she
stopped
my
mouth
with
a
kiss
and
we
both
laughed
miss
penderkins
i
say
miss
penderlet
miss
miss
what
do
i
mean
she
cries
what
the
point
of
the
names
why
take
my
name
in
vain
why
what
how
she
does
not
know
that
clever
young
men
sometimes
trade
on
their
reputation
among
simpler
folk
by
pretending
that
meaningless
remarks
conceal
some
subtlety
or
cynicism
some
little
attic
snap
i
have
been
teaching
her
to
distinguish
the
songs
of
different
birds
and
often
we
sit
a
long
while
in
the
cathedral
wood
while
i
say
that
and
what
that
and
she
tells
me
it
is
delightful
to
watch
her
dear
serious
face
as
she
listens
this
evening
i
gave
a
examination
as
per
below
what
does
the
yellow
hammer
say
what
colour
are
the
hedge
sparrow
eggs
describe
the
nightjar
voice
how
many
eggs
does
it
lay
oh
you
never
told
me
about
the
nightjar
she
cried
outraged
no
it
a
difficult
question
put
in
for
candidates
taking
honours
then
we
rambled
on
into
tomfoolery
describe
the
of
a
motor
omnibus
why
does
the
chicken
cross
the
road
and
that
when
a
railway
engine
whistled
in
the
distance
measure
by
this
our
happiness
at
a
quarter
past
eight
this
morning
the
horse
and
trap
were
awaiting
me
outside
and
bidding
her
goodbye
i
got
in
and
drove
off
she
riding
on
the
step
down
so
far
as
the
gate
then
we
waved
till
we
were
out
of
sight
back
in
london
by
she
makes
slow
progress
poor
dear
her
nerves
are
still
very
much
of
a
jangle
but
i
am
better
my
heart
is
less
wobbly
r
can
not
make
me
out
he
says
one
day
i
complain
bitterly
at
not
receiving
a
portuguese
sonnet
once
a
week
and
the
next
all
is
well
and
love
reigneth
verily
a
sphinx
spent
the
afternoon
at
the
royal
army
medical
college
in
consultation
with
the
professor
of
hygiene
amid
all
the
paraphernalia
of
research
even
when
discussing
a
serious
problem
with
a
serious
major
i
could
not
take
myself
seriously
i
am
incurably
trivial
and
always
feel
myself
an
irresponsible
youth
wondering
and
futile
among
owlish
at
departed
and
went
down
on
vauxhall
bridge
and
watched
a
being
unloaded
before
returning
to
the
museum
i
could
readily
hang
on
behind
a
cart
stare
at
an
accident
pull
a
face
at
a
policeman
and
then
run
away
it
annoys
me
to
find
the
attitude
of
our
relatives
not
one
with
a
remonstrance
for
us
and
yet
all
the
omens
are
against
our
marriage
in
the
state
of
my
nervous
system
and
in
the
state
of
hers
we
have
both
had
serious
nervous
how
impossible
it
seems
yet
they
say
all
the
old
conventional
things
to
us
about
our
happiness
and
so
on
am
i
a
moral
monster
surely
a
man
who
can
combine
such
calculating
callousness
with
really
generous
impulses
of
the
heart
is
what
the
truth
is
i
think
i
am
in
love
with
her
but
i
am
also
mightily
in
love
with
myself
one
or
the
other
has
to
give
if
sometimes
you
saw
me
in
my
room
by
myself
you
would
say
i
was
a
ridiculous
coxcomb
for
i
walk
about
look
out
of
the
window
then
at
the
mirror
turning
my
head
sideways
perhaps
so
as
to
see
it
in
profile
or
i
gaze
down
into
my
eyes
my
eyes
always
impress
me
and
wonder
what
effect
i
produce
on
others
this
i
believe
is
not
so
much
vanity
as
curiosity
i
know
i
am
not
prepossessing
in
appearance
my
nose
is
crooked
and
my
skin
is
blotched
yet
my
physique
because
it
is
mine
interests
me
i
like
to
see
myself
walking
and
talking
i
should
like
to
hold
myself
in
my
hand
in
front
of
me
like
a
punchinello
and
carefully
examine
myself
at
my
leisure
saw
my
brother
a
off
at
waterloo
en
route
for
armageddon
darling
fellow
he
shook
hands
with
p
and
h
and
p
wished
him
goodbye
and
good
luck
then
he
held
my
hand
a
moment
said
goodbye
old
man
and
for
a
second
gave
me
a
queer
little
nervous
look
i
could
only
say
goodbye
but
we
understand
each
other
perfectly
it
is
horrible
i
love
him
tenderly
sleep
means
unconsciousness
unconsciousness
is
a
solemn
state
you
get
it
for
example
from
a
blow
on
the
head
with
a
mallet
it
always
weightily
impresses
me
to
see
someone
asleep
especially
someone
i
love
as
stretched
out
as
still
as
a
log
who
perhaps
a
few
minutes
ago
was
alive
even
animated
and
there
is
nothing
so
welcome
unless
it
be
the
sunrise
as
the
first
faint
gleam
of
recognition
in
the
eye
when
consciousness
like
a
mighty
river
begins
to
flow
in
and
restore
our
love
to
us
again
when
i
go
to
bed
myself
i
sometimes
jealously
guard
my
faculties
from
being
filched
away
by
sleep
i
almost
fear
sleep
it
makes
me
apprehensive
this
wonderful
and
unknowable
thing
which
is
going
to
happen
to
me
for
which
i
must
lay
myself
out
on
a
bed
and
wait
with
an
elaborate
preparedness
unlike
sir
thomas
browne
i
am
not
always
so
content
to
take
my
leave
of
the
sun
and
sleep
if
need
be
into
the
resurrection
and
i
sometimes
lie
awake
and
wonder
when
the
mysterious
visitor
will
come
to
me
and
call
me
away
from
this
thrilling
world
and
how
he
does
it
to
which
end
i
try
to
remain
conscious
of
the
gradual
process
and
to
understand
it
an
impossibility
of
course
involving
a
contradiction
in
terms
so
i
shall
never
know
nor
will
anybody
else
i
had
such
a
successful
evening
you
no
idea
the
pen
simply
flew
along
automatically
easy
page
after
page
in
perfect
sequence
my
style
trilled
and
bickered
and
rolled
and
ululated
in
an
infinite
variety
you
will
find
in
it
all
the
subtlest
modulations
inflections
and
suavities
my
afflatus
came
down
from
heaven
in
a
bar
of
light
like
the
shekinah
straight
from
god
very
god
of
very
god
i
worked
in
a
golden
halo
of
light
and
electric
sparks
came
off
my
pen
nib
as
i
scratched
the
paper
clever
young
argued
with
r
this
morning
he
is
a
type
specimen
of
the
clever
young
man
we
both
are
our
flowers
of
speech
are
often
forced
plants
paradoxes
and
cynicisms
fly
as
thick
as
driving
rain
and
shaw
is
our
great
exemplar
i
could
write
out
an
exhaustive
analysis
of
the
clever
young
man
and
being
one
myself
can
speak
from
inspired
sources
as
the
newspapers
say
a
common
habit
is
to
underline
and
memorise
short
sharp
witty
remarks
he
sees
in
books
and
then
on
future
occasions
dish
them
up
for
his
own
if
the
author
be
famous
he
begins
as
says
etc
if
unknown
the
quotation
is
quietly
purloined
he
is
always
very
and
at
the
same
time
very
and
very
conceited
you
tell
me
with
tonic
candour
that
i
am
insufferably
conceited
in
return
i
smile
making
a
sardonic
avowal
of
my
good
opinion
of
myself
my
theory
being
that
as
conceit
is
as
a
rule
implicit
and
as
a
rule
blushingly
denied
you
will
mistake
my
impudent
confession
for
bluff
and
conclude
there
is
really
something
far
more
substantial
and
honest
beneath
my
apparent
conceit
if
on
the
other
hand
i
am
conceited
why
i
have
admitted
it
i
agree
with
you
but
there
is
no
virtue
in
the
confession
being
quite
detached
and
unashamed
still
you
have
caught
me
by
the
tail
it
is
very
difficult
to
circumvent
a
clever
young
man
he
is
as
agile
as
a
monkey
his
principal
concern
of
course
is
to
arouse
and
maintain
a
reputation
for
profundity
and
wit
this
is
done
by
the
simple
mechanical
formula
of
antithesis
if
you
like
winkles
he
proves
that
cockles
are
inveterately
better
if
you
admire
ruskin
he
tears
him
to
ribbons
if
you
want
to
learn
to
swim
as
it
is
safer
he
shows
it
is
more
dangerous
to
know
how
to
swim
and
so
on
i
know
his
whole
box
of
tricks
i
myself
am
now
playing
the
clever
young
man
by
writing
out
this
analysis
just
as
if
i
were
not
one
myself
you
doubt
my
cleverness
well
some
years
ago
in
r
presence
i
called
the
rev
fastidious
brisk
the
nickname
be
it
recalled
which
henley
gave
to
stevenson
without
the
addition
of
at
the
time
i
had
no
intention
of
appropriating
the
witticism
as
i
quite
imagined
r
was
acquainted
with
it
his
unexpected
explosion
of
mirth
however
made
me
uncomfortably
uncertain
of
this
yet
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
muster
the
honesty
to
assure
him
that
my
feather
was
a
borrowed
one
a
few
weeks
later
he
referred
to
it
again
as
certainly
one
of
my
better
ones
but
still
i
remained
dumb
and
the
time
for
explanations
went
for
once
and
all
now
see
what
a
pretty
pickle
i
am
in
the
name
brisk
or
is
in
constant
use
by
us
for
this
particular
person
he
goes
by
no
other
name
meanwhile
i
sit
and
wonder
how
long
it
will
be
before
r
finds
me
out
there
are
all
sorts
of
ways
in
which
he
might
find
out
he
might
read
about
it
for
himself
someone
might
tell
him
or
worst
of
all
one
day
when
we
are
dining
out
somewhere
he
will
announce
to
the
whole
company
my
brilliant
appellation
as
a
little
diversion
i
shall
at
once
observe
that
the
person
opposite
me
and
is
about
to
air
his
knowledge
then
i
shall
look
sternly
at
him
and
try
to
hold
him
he
will
hesitate
and
i
shall
land
him
with
a
left
and
right
i
suppose
you
read
henley
verses
on
stevenson
i
remark
easily
and
in
a
moment
or
so
later
the
conversation
has
moved
on
am
getting
married
at
register
office
on
september
it
is
impossible
to
set
down
here
all
the
labyrinthine
ambages
of
my
will
and
feelings
in
regard
to
this
event
such
incredible
vacillations
doubts
fears
i
have
been
living
at
a
great
rate
below
surface
recently
if
you
enjoy
only
twelve
months
happiness
the
doctor
said
to
me
it
is
worth
while
but
he
makes
a
recommendation
at
his
suggestion
e
went
to
see
him
and
from
his
own
mouth
learnt
all
the
truth
about
the
state
of
my
health
to
prevent
possible
mutual
recriminations
in
the
future
to
marry
an
introspective
dyspeptic
what
a
prospect
for
her
i
exercise
my
microscopic
analysis
on
her
now
as
well
as
on
myself
this
power
in
me
is
growing
daily
more
automatic
and
more
repugnant
it
is
a
nasty
morbid
unhealthy
growth
that
i
want
to
hide
if
i
can
not
destroy
it
amounts
to
being
able
at
will
to
switch
myself
in
and
out
of
all
my
most
cherished
emotions
it
is
like
the
case
in
sir
michael
foster
of
a
man
who
by
pressing
a
tumour
in
his
neck
could
stop
or
at
any
rate
control
the
action
of
his
heart
house
pride
in
folk
for
example
and
at
green
or
the
teignmouth
folk
is
very
trying
to
the
bachelor
visitor
they
will
carry
a
chair
across
the
room
as
tenderly
as
tho
it
were
a
child
and
until
its
safe
transit
is
assured
all
conversation
goes
by
the
board
or
the
wife
suddenly
makes
a
remark
to
the
husband
both
thereupon
start
up
simultaneously
leaving
the
fate
of
warsaw
undecided
while
you
silenced
by
this
unexpected
manœuvre
wilt
away
in
your
chair
the
pregnant
phrase
on
your
lips
presently
they
the
room
with
the
kitten
that
was
heard
in
the
scullery
or
with
a
big
stick
used
to
flourish
at
a
little
tomtit
on
the
rose
tree
apologises
and
both
settle
down
again
recompose
their
countenances
into
a
listening
aspect
and
with
a
devastating
politeness
pick
up
the
poor
little
thread
of
the
conversation
where
it
left
off
with
europe
you
were
saying
i
mobilise
my
scattered
units
of
ideas
but
it
is
all
a
little
chilly
for
the
lady
of
the
house
if
she
listens
with
her
face
and
speaks
with
her
lips
her
heart
is
far
from
me
she
fixes
a
glassy
eye
on
the
tip
of
my
cigarette
waiting
to
see
if
the
ash
will
fall
on
her
carpet
the
most
intimate
and
extensive
journal
can
only
give
each
day
a
relatively
small
sifting
of
the
almost
infinite
number
of
things
that
flow
thro
the
consciousness
however
vigilant
and
artful
a
diarist
may
be
plenty
of
things
escape
him
and
in
any
event
is
not
to
keep
a
journal
is
to
have
a
secret
liaison
of
a
very
sentimental
kind
a
is
a
to
whom
everything
is
told
and
confessed
for
an
engaged
or
married
man
to
have
a
secret
who
knows
things
which
are
concealed
from
his
lady
seems
to
me
to
be
deliberate
infidelity
i
am
as
it
were
engaged
to
two
women
and
one
of
them
is
being
deceived
the
word
deceit
comes
up
against
me
in
this
double
life
i
lead
and
insists
i
shall
name
a
plain
thing
bluntly
there
is
something
very
like
sheer
moral
obliquity
in
these
entries
behind
her
back
is
this
journal
habit
slowly
corrupting
my
character
can
an
engaged
or
married
man
conscientiously
continue
to
write
his
this
question
of
giving
up
my
faithful
friend
after
september
i
must
consider
of
course
most
men
have
something
to
conceal
from
someone
most
married
men
are
furtive
creatures
and
married
women
too
but
i
have
a
gregers
passion
for
life
to
be
lived
on
a
foundation
of
truth
in
every
intercourse
i
would
have
my
wife
know
all
about
me
and
if
i
can
not
be
loved
for
what
i
surely
am
i
do
not
want
to
be
loved
for
what
i
am
not
if
i
continue
to
write
therefore
she
shall
read
what
i
have
written
my
journal
keeps
open
house
to
every
kind
of
happening
in
my
soul
provided
it
is
a
veritable
autochthon
i
do
care
how
much
of
a
tatterdemalion
or
how
ugly
or
repulsive
i
take
him
in
and
i
fear
sponge
him
down
with
excuses
to
make
him
more
creditable
in
eyes
you
may
say
why
trouble
whether
you
do
or
whether
you
do
tell
us
all
the
beastly
little
subterranean
atrocities
that
go
on
in
your
mind
any
eminently
or
reader
will
ask
who
in
faith
name
is
interested
in
your
introspective
in
fact
who
the
devil
are
you
to
myself
a
person
of
vast
importance
and
vast
interest
i
reply
as
are
other
men
if
i
could
but
understand
them
as
well
and
in
the
firm
belief
that
whatever
is
inexorably
true
however
unpleasant
and
discreditable
in
fact
true
things
can
never
lack
a
certain
dignity
i
would
have
you
know
and
that
actual
crimes
have
many
a
time
been
enacted
in
the
secrecy
of
my
own
heart
and
the
only
difference
between
me
and
an
habitual
criminal
is
that
the
habitual
criminal
has
the
courage
and
the
nerve
and
i
have
not
what
then
may
these
crimes
be
nothing
much
only
murders
theft
rape
etc
none
of
them
thank
god
fructify
in
action
or
at
all
events
only
the
lesser
ones
my
outward
and
visible
life
if
i
examine
it
is
merely
a
series
of
commonplace
colourless
and
thoroughly
average
events
but
if
i
analyse
myself
my
inner
life
i
find
i
am
both
incredibly
worse
and
incredibly
better
than
i
appear
i
am
christ
and
the
devil
at
the
same
time
or
as
my
sister
once
called
me
a
child
a
wise
man
and
the
devil
all
in
one
just
as
no
one
knows
my
crimes
so
no
one
knows
of
my
good
actions
a
generous
impulse
seizes
me
round
the
heart
and
i
am
suddenly
moved
to
give
a
poor
devil
a
note
but
no
one
knows
this
because
by
the
time
i
come
to
the
point
i
find
myself
handing
him
a
and
am
quite
powerless
to
intervene
similarly
my
murders
end
merely
in
a
little
phlegm
on
a
the
other
day
a
woman
with
a
baby
sat
opposite
the
baby
bawled
and
the
woman
at
once
began
to
unlace
herself
exposing
a
large
red
udder
which
she
swung
into
the
baby
face
the
infant
however
continued
to
cry
and
the
woman
said
come
on
there
a
good
boy
if
you
do
i
shall
give
it
to
the
gentleman
opposite
do
i
look
virumque
cano
a
beggar
said
to
me
this
morning
in
the
high
street
or
as
the
boy
said
and
the
man
with
a
dog
mistaking
the
verb
for
the
noun
oh
yes
sir
i
remember
my
latin
of
course
i
feel
it
rather
invidious
my
coming
to
you
like
this
but
everything
is
absolutely
est
with
me
and
so
on
my
dear
sir
i
answered
expansively
i
am
as
poor
as
you
are
you
at
least
have
seen
better
days
you
say
but
i
never
have
he
changed
in
a
minute
his
cringeing
manner
and
rejoined
no
i
should
think
you
had
eyeing
me
critically
and
slinking
off
am
i
shabby
by
jove
i
hope
i
live
why
does
an
old
crock
like
myself
go
on
living
it
causes
me
genuine
amazement
i
feel
almost
ashamed
of
myself
because
i
am
not
yet
dead
seeing
that
so
many
of
my
contemporaries
have
perished
in
this
war
i
am
so
grateful
for
being
allowed
to
live
so
long
that
nothing
that
happens
to
me
except
death
could
upset
me
much
i
should
be
happy
in
a
coal
mine
suffering
from
indigestion
the
symptoms
include
excessive
pandiculation
excessive
oscitation
excessive
eructation
dyspnœa
sphygmic
flutters
abnormal
porrigo
a
desiccated
epidermis
or
creeping
ferlies
i
probably
know
more
about
lice
than
was
ever
before
stored
together
within
the
compass
of
a
single
human
mind
i
know
the
greek
for
louse
the
latin
the
french
the
german
the
italian
i
can
reel
off
all
the
best
remedies
for
pediculosis
i
am
acquainted
with
the
measures
adopted
for
dealing
with
the
nuisance
in
the
field
by
the
german
imperial
board
of
health
by
the
british
by
the
armies
of
the
russians
the
french
the
austrians
the
italians
i
know
its
life
history
and
structure
how
many
eggs
it
lays
and
how
often
the
anatomy
of
its
brain
and
stomach
and
the
physiology
of
all
its
little
parts
i
have

a

called
to

on

drew
some

am
spending
my

holidays
in
the
lakes
at
coniston
with
g
and
r
i
am
simply
consumed
with
pride
at
being
among
the
mountains
at
last
it
is
an
enormous
personal
success
to
have
arrived
at
coniston
climbed
a
windy
eminence
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
and
had
a
splendid
view
of
helvellyn
like
a
great
hog
back
it
is
fine
to
walk
over
the
elastic
turf
with
the
wind
bellowing
into
each
ear
and
swirling
all
around
me
in
a
mighty
sea
of
air
until
i
was
as
and
resonant
as
a
i
moved
along
as
easily
as
a
disembodied
spirit
and
felt
free
almost
transparent
the
old
earth
seemed
to
have
soaked
me
up
into
itself
i
became
dissolved
into
it
my
separate
body
was
melted
away
from
me
and
nature
received
me
into
her
deepest
communion
until
until
i
got
on
the
lee
side
of
a
hedge
where
the
calm
brought
me
back
my
gaol
of
clay
fourteen
days
hence
i
shall
be
a
married
man
but
i
feel
most
dejected
about
it
when
i
fell
down
the
other
day
i
believe
i
slightly
concussed
my
spinal
column
with
the
result
that
my
trouble
has
returned
but
this
time
on
the
side
paralysis
and
horrible
vertigo
and
presentiments
of
sudden
collapse
as
i
walk
i
fear
i
have
been
overdoing
it
in
this
tempting
mountain
region
walking
too
far
etc
so
i
am
slacking
it
was
fortunate
i
did
not
get
concussion
of
the
brain
i
came
within
an
inch
of
it
the
hair
of
my
head
brushed
the
ground
buxom
rogue
in
i
knocked
at
the
door
of
sunbeam
cottage
the
other
morning
to
know
if
they
had
a
boat
for
hire
the
door
was
promptly
opened
by
a
plump
charming
little
wench
of
about
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
kitchen
with
its
gunrack
holding
two
fowling
pieces
a
grandfather
clock
in
one
corner
and
a
dresser
full
of
blueish
china
we
do
let
our
boat
out
for
hire
she
answered
with
a
smile
so
honest
and
natural
and
spontaneous
that
i
was
already
saying
to
myself
i
had
never
met
with
anything
like
it
at
all
when
she
stretched
up
her
bare
arm
strong
creamy
and
soft
just
reached
a
big
key
strung
to
a
wooden
block
and
lying
on
the
top
shelf
of
the
dresser
and
at
once
handed
it
to
me
with
but
you
are
quite
welcome
to
use
it
and
here
is
the
key
to
the
boathouse
i
now
felt
certain
that
she
was
one
in
a
million
and
thanked
her
most
awfully
i
have
never
met
such
generosity
it
very
nice
on
the
lake
just
now
she
said
i
like
to
lie
in
the
boat
with
a
book
and
let
her
drift
i
asked
her
if
she
would
not
come
too
but
this
tight
little
fairy
was
too
busy
in
the
house
she
is
clara
middleton
done
in
earthenware
subsequently
r
and
i
often
visited
the
cottage
and
we
became
great
friends
her
mother
showing
us
some
letters
she
received
as
a
girl
from
john
ruskin
a
great
friend
of
hers
the
gamekeeper
himself
said
that
for
his
part
he
could
never
read
ruskin
books
it
was
like
driving
a
springless
cart
over
a
rocky
road
we
all
laughed
and
i
said
he
was
prejudiced
in
view
of
the
letters
which
began
my
darling
and
finished
up
yr
loving
but
said
he
had
never
read
them
and
madge
ah
that
name
said
her
father
had
never
shewn
the
least
interest
in
them
at
which
we
laughed
again
and
the
gamekeeper
laughed
too
he
is
such
a
jolly
man
they
all
are
delightfully
simple
charming
folk
and
we
talked
of
beasts
and
birds
that
live
on
the
mountains
bathed
in
the
lake
from
the
boat
it
was
brilliantly
fine
r
dipped
her
paddles
in
occasionally
just
to
keep
the
boat
from
grounding
then
i
clambered
over
the
bows
and
stood
up
to
dry
myself
in
the
sun
like
one
of
tuke
young
men
my
birthday
in
london
again
went
straight
to
the
doctor
and
reported
myself
i
quite
expected
him
to
forbid
the
marriage
as
i
could
scarcely
hobble
to
his
house

amazement

apparently
made
light
of

first
experience
of
a
zeppelin
raid
bombs
dropped
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
and
shrapnel
from
the
guns
fell
on
our
roof
we
got
very
pannicky
and
went
into
a
neighbour
house
where
we
cowered
down
in
our
in
absolute
darkness
while
bombs
exploded
and
the
dogs
barked
i
was
scared
out
of
my
life
and
had
a
fit
of
uncontrollable
trembling
later
we
rang
up
and
and
thank
heavens
both
are
safe
a
great
fire
is
burning
in
london
judging
by
the
red
glare
at
midnight
sat
and
drank
sherry
and
smoked
a
cigar
with
my
braces
depending
from
my

like

sad
to

in

he

of
all
no

i

his

i
oft
recall
there
is
nothing
left
to

when
one
we
loved
was
called
away

took
her
home
it
was
his
will
forget
her
no
we
never
will
these
piteous
screeds
fill
me
with
and
with
contempt
alternately
in
a
rhythm
what
is
the
truth
about
them
is
the
grief
of
these
people
as
mean
and
ridiculous
as
their
rhymes
or
is
it
a
pitiful
inarticulateness
or
is
it
merely
vulgar
advertisement
of
their
sorrow
or
does
it
signify
a
passionate
intention
never
to
forget
or
a
fear
of
forgetting
the
rhymes
being
used
as
a
fillip
to
the
memory
or
most
miserable
of
all
is
it
just
a
custom
and
one
in
order
to
appear
respectable
in
others
eyes
are
they
poor
souls
or
contemptible
fools
there
is
a
ridiculous
cocker
spaniel
at
the
house
where
we
are

he
must
have
had
a
love
affair
and
been
jilted
or
else
he
a
sort
of
village
idiot
the
landlady
says
he
not
so
silly
as
he
looks
but
he
looks
very
silly
he
languishes
sentimentally
and
when
we
laugh
at
him
he
looks
hurt
we
took
him
up
on
the
down
and
it
seemed
to
brighten
him
up
really
he
is
sane
enough
with
plenty
of
commonsense
and
good
manners
but
he
is
kept
at
home
in
the

so
much

no

than

anyhow
are
damned
interesting
which
the
is
i
was
surprised
to
discover
the

that
when
i
talked
of
chipples
no
one
understood
what
i
meant
it
proves
to
be
a
dialect
word
familiar
to
all
residents
in
devonshire
and
designating
spring
onions
anyway
you
wo
find
it
in

the

i
respectfully
dedicate
this
little
portion
of
work
to
science
common
sense
or
true
knowledge
i
am
convinced
that
human
welfare
is
so
dependent
upon
science
that
civilisation
would
not
endure
without
it
and
that
what
is
meant
by
progress
would
be
impossible
also
i
am
convinced
that
the
great
majority
of
mankind
are
too
ignorant
that
education
is
too
archaic
and
impractical
as
looked
at
from
the
standpoint
of
intrinsic
knowledge
there
is
too
little
known
of
the
essential
unity
of
the
universe
and
of
things
included
for
instance
man
himself
opinions
and
prejudices
rule
in
the
place
of
what
is
true
part
ii
is
dedicated
to
the
genius
of
mankind
especially
to
that
form
of
it
expressed
in
monistic
philosophy
whose
conceived
perception
is
the
highest
attainment
reached
by
man
i
can
only
echo
whistler
remark
one
day
as
he
stood
before
an
execrably
bad
drawing
god
bless
my
soul
uttered
slowly
and
thoughtfully
and
then
repeated
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
the
editor
adds
a
serious
footnote
dissociating
himself
and
a
scarabee
to
whom
i
shewed
the
work
read
it
with
a
clouded
brow
and
then
said
i
think
it
rather
out

of
this

down
with

night
i
am
down
with

our
little

quite
calm
thank

we
heard
guns
going
off
and
i
had
a
fit
of
trembling
as
i
lay
in

dead

were

on

at
and
another
at
midnight
the
first
time
the
caretaker
of
the
flats
came
up
very
alarmed
to
say
zeppelins
about
so
we
put
out
the
lights
then
at
midnight
when
everyone
else
was
asleep
i
heard
a
big
voice
shout
up
from
the
street

out
there
they
about
again

still
in

i
am
nauseated
with
myself
and
my
suppose
i
have
been
whizzing
as
i
call
it
what
then
they
are
but
subjective
trifles
meanwhile
other

seeing
great
adventures
in

and

exclaimed
the
admiral
who
in
a
little
group
of
naval
officers
on
board
the
flagship
had
been
watching
sink
in
the
ægean
he
shuts
his
telescope
with
a
click
and
returns
in
great
dudgeon
to
his
own
quarters
how
i
envy
all
these
men
who
are
participating
in
this
war
soldiers
sailors
war
correspondents
all
who
live
and
throb
and
are
not
afraid
i
am
a
timid
youth
ansemic
wear
spectacles
and
am
frightened
by
a
zep
raid
how
humiliating
i
hate
myself
for
a
craven
i
am
suffocated
for
want
of
more
life
and
courage
my
damnable
body
is
slowly
killing
off
all
my
spirit
and
buoyancy
even
my
mind
is
becoming
blurred
my
memory
is
like
an
old
man
exactly
ask
yet
thro
all
my
nausea
here
i
remain
happy
to
discuss
myself
and
my
little
mishaps
i
damned
sick
of
myself
and
all
my
neurotic
whimperings
and
so
i
hereby
and
now
intend
to
lead
a
new
life
and
throw
this
journal
to
the
devil
i
want
to
mangle
it
tear
it
to
shreds
you
smug
hypocritical
readers
you
get
no
more
of
me
all
you
say
i
know
is
true
before
you
say
it
and
i
know
all
the
criticism
you
are
going
to
launch
so
please
spare
yourself
the
trouble
you
can
not
enlighten
me
upon
myself
i
i
disgust
myself
and
you
and
as
for
you
you
can
go
to
the
devil
with
this
journal
armed
with
a
certificate
from
my
doctor
in
a
sealed
envelope
and
addressed
to
the
medical
officer
examining
barbellion
i
got
leave
to
attend
the
recruiting
office
and
offer
my
services
to
my
king
and
country
at
the
time
the
fact
that
the
envelope
was
sealed
caused
no
suspicion
and
i
had
been
comfortably
carrying
the
document
about
in
my
pocket
for
days
past
of
course
i
attended
merely
as
a
matter
of
form
under
pressure
of
the
authorities
as
i
knew
i
was
totally
unfit
but
not
quite
unfit
after
receiving
this
precious
certificate
i
learnt
that
k
was
recruiting
doctor
at
w
and
he
offered
to
put
me
thro
in
five
minutes
as
he
knows
the
state
of
my
health
so
at
a
time
agreed
upon
i
went
and
was
immediately
rejected
as
soon
as
he
had
stethoscoped
my
heart
the
certificate
therefore
was
not
needed
and
coming
home
in
the
train
i
opened
it
out
of
curiosity
i
was
quite
casual
and
thought
it
would
be
merely
interesting
to
see
what
m
said
it
was
some
months
ago
it
ran
barbellion
shewed
the
just
visible
symptoms
of
and
altho
this
fact
was
at
once
communicated
to
my
relatives
it
was
withheld
from
me
and
m
therefore
asked
the
to
respect
this
confidence
and
to
reject
me
without
stating
on
what
grounds
he
went
on
to
refer
to
my
patellar
and
plantar
reflexes
by
which
time
i
had
had
enough
tore
the
paper
up
and
flung
it
out
of
the
railway
carriage
window
i
then
returned
to
the
museum
intending
to
find
out
what
was
in
clifford
allbutt
system
of
medicine
i
wondered
whether
it
was
brain
or
heart
and
the
very
thought
gave
me
palpitation
i
hope
it
is
heartsomething
short
and
sharp
rather
than
lingering
but
i
believe
it
must
be
of
the
brain
the
opposite
process
of
softening
occurring
in
old
age
i
recall
words
to
me
before
geting
married
that
i
had
this
nerve
weakness
but
i
was
more
likely
to
succumb
to
pneumonia
than
to
any
nervous
trouble
and
that
only
months
happiness
would
be
worth
while
on
the
whole
i
am
amazed
at
the
calm
way
in
which
i
take
this
news
i
was
a
fool
never
to
have
suspected
serious
nerve
trouble
before
does
dear
e
know
what
did
m
tell
her
when
he
saw
her
before
our
marriage
as
soon
as
i
woke
up
in
this
clear
country
air
this
morning
i
thought
i
have
decided
never
to
find
out
what
it
is
i
shall
find
out
in
good
time
by
the
course
of
events
a
few
years
ago
the
news
would
have
scared
me
but
not
so
now
it
only
interests
me
i
have
been
happy
merry
and
quite
i
believe
it
creeping
paralysis
my
left
leg
goes
lame
after
a
short
walk
fortunately
e
does
not
take
alarm
spent
the
last
two
days
both
of
us
in
a
state
of
unrelieved
gloom
the
clouds
never
lifted
for
a
moment
it
awful
i
scarcely
have
spoken
a
word
and
eugenically
what
kind
of
an
infant
would
even
a
mark
tapley
expect
of
a
father
with
a
medical
history
like
mine
and
a
mother
with
a
nervous
system
like
hers
could
anything
be
more
unfortunate
and
the
war
what
may
not
have
happened
by
this
time
next
year
my
health
is
grotesque
i
wonder
if
she
knows
i
believe
she
does
but
i
am
afraid
to
broach
the
matter
in
case
she
does
i
think
she
must
know
something
otherwise
she
would
show
more
alarm
over
my
leg
and
when
i
went
to
the
recruiting
office
she
seemed
to
show
no
fear
whatever
lest
they
took
me
several
times
a
day
in
the
middle
of
a
talk
or
a
meal
or
a
kiss
this
problem
flashes
thro
my
mind
i
look
at
her
but
find
no
solution
however
for
the
present
the
matter
is
not
urgent
the
english
dialect
dictionary
derives
the
word
from
old
french
and
gives
a
reference
to
piers
plowman
why
has
such
an
old
and
useful
word
become
a
part
of
the
english
language
like
others
also
brought
over
at
the
time
of
the
norman
conquest
since
i
last
wrote
a
month
ago
i
have
recovered
my
buoyancy
after
a
blow
which
kept
me
under
water
so
long
i
thought
i
should
never
come
up
and
be
happy
again
i
was
reciting
my
woes
to
r
and
gaining
much
relief
thereby
when
we
espied
another
crony
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
crossed
over
at
once
bandied
words
with
him
and
then
walked
on
picking
up
the
thread
of
my
lugubrious
story
just
where
i
had
left
off
secretly
staggered
at
my
emotional
agility
i
got
to
this
now
i
simply
do
care
and
she
draiglet
all
her
petticoatie
coming
thro
the
rye
these
words
have
a
ridiculous
fascination
for
me
i
can
not
resist
their
saccharine
affectionate
nay
amorous
jingle
and
keep
repeating
them
aloud
all
over
the
house
as
lamb
once
kept
reciting
rose
aylmer
we
took
possession
of
our
country
cottage
very
charming
and
overlooking
a
beautiful
park
have
just
discovered
the
journal
of
the
de
goncourts
and
been
reading
it
greedily
life
has
really
been
a
commodity
i
am
boiling
over
with
vitality
chattering
amiably
to
everyone
about
nothing
argumentative
sanguine
serious
ridiculous
i
called
old
r
a
rapscallion
a
curmudgeon
and
a
scaramouche
and
e
a
trull
a
drab
a
trollop
a
callet
you
certainly
are
a
unique
husband
said
that
sweet
little
lady
and
i
with
me
one
of
the
symptoms
of
delirium
is
always
a
melodramatic
truculence
i
shake
my
fist
in
r
face
and
make
him
explode
with
laughing
the
sun
and
the
great
whopping
white
clouds
all
bellied
out
made
me
feel
inside
quite
a
bright
young
dog
wriggling
its
body
in
ecstatic
delight
let
loose
upon
the
green
sward
you
must
come
down
for
a
week
end
i
said
to
r
at
lunch
come
down
as
soon
as
you
can
you
will
find
every
comfort
it
is
an
enormous
house
i
have
not
succeeded
in
finding
my
way
about
it
and
dangerous
to
lose
yourself
makes
you
late
for
dinner
when
you
arrive
our
gilded
janitor
will
say
believe
barbellion
is
in
the
library
black
eunuchs
wait
on
you
at
dinner
i
suppose
r
rejoined
oh
yes
and
golden
chandeliers
and
a
marble
all
in
barbaric
splendour
yes
i
shall
certainly
be
glad
to
come
down
said
r
phlegmatically
and
so
on
and
so
on
words
idle
words
all
day
in
a
continuous
rush
and
i
am
sure
that
the
match
which
fired
the
was
the
discovery
of
the
de
goncourts
journal
it
extraordinary
how
i
have
been
going
on
from
week
to
week
quite
calmly
for
all
the
world
as
if
i
had
read
all
the
books
and
seen
all
the
places
and
done
everything
according
to
the
heart
desire
this
book
has
really
jolted
me
out
of
my
complacency
to
think
that
all
this
time
i
have
been
dead
to
so
much
why
i
might
have
died
unconscious
that
the
de
goncourts
had
ever
lived
and
written
their
colossal
book
and
now
i
am
aware
of
it
i
am
all
in
a
fever
to
read
it
and
take
it
up
into
my
brain
i
might
die
now
before
i
have
finished
it
a
thought
that
makes
me
wild
with
desire
just
as
i
once
endured
most
awful
pangs
when
i
felt
my
health
going
and
believed
that
i
might
die
before
having
ever
been
in
love
to
die
and
never
to
have
been
in
love
for
an
instant
at
a
time
this
possibility
used
to
make
me
writhe
r
has
an
unpleasant
habit
of
making
some
scarifying
announcement
drawing
forth
an
explosive
query
from
me
and
then
lapsing
at
once
into
an
eleusinian
silence
he
appears
to
take
a
sensuous
pleasure
in
the
pause
that
keeps
you
expectant
i
could
forgive
a
man
who
keeps
you
on
tenterhooks
for
two
puffs
in
order
to
keep
his
pipe
alight
but
r
shuts
up
out
of
sheer
and
goes
on
gazing
at
the
horizon
with
the
eyes
of
a
seer
he
thinks
trying
to
cod
me
he
sees
a
portent
there
only
revealed
to
god
elect
i
told
him
this
in
the
middle
of
one
of
his
luxurious
silences
i
will
tell
you
he
said
deliberately
when
we
reach
the
oratory
we
were
in
brompton
road
which
side
of
it
i
enquired
anxiously
this
or
that
that
said
he
will
depend
on
how
you
behave
in
the
meantime
we
met
a
remarkable
bulldog
in
the
street
humbly
following
behind
a
tiny
boy
to
whom
it
was
attached
by
a
piece
of
string
at
the
time
we
were
following
in
the
wake
of
three
magnificent
serbian
officers
and
i
was
particularly
interesting
myself
in
the
curious
cut
of
their
top
boots
but
the
bulldog
was
the
red
herring
in
our
path
is
that
a
dog
i
asked
the
little
boy
he
assured
me
that
it
was
and
so
it
turned
out
to
be
tho
would
have
been
a
better
name
for
it
the
forelegs
being
more
bandied
the
back
broader
and
the
mouth
wider
than
in
any
bulldog
i
have
ever
seen
it
was
a
we
turned
and
walked
on
there
said
r
now
we
have
lost
our
serbian
officers
may
i
use
your
microscope
he
asked
by
all
means
i
said
with
a
gesture
of
elaborate
politeness
he
sat
down
at
my
table
in
my
chair
and
used
my
instrument
becoming
at
once
absorbed
and
oblivious
to
my
banter
as
per
below
as
scotchmen
i
said
are
monuments
rather
than
men
this
latest
raid
on
edinboro
worthy
inhabitants
must
be
called
vandalsim
rather
than
murder
no
answer
i
continued
to
stand
by
my
chair
how
pleased
swift
johnson
lamb
and
other
would
be
hope
you
do
mind
my
occupying
your
chair
a
little
longer
the
scotchman
said
but
this
is
a
larva
has
curious
maxillæ
and
his
voice
faded
away
in
abstraction
oh
no
go
on
i
said
i
fear
it
is
a
grievous
absence
of
hospitality
on
my
part
in
not
providing
you
with
a
glass
of
whiskey
can
i
offer
you
water
sir
no
answer
another
enthusiast
ushered
himself
in
was
greeted
with
delight
by
the
first
and
invited
to
sit
down
i
pulled
out
a
chair
for
him
and
said
shave
sir
or
hair
cut
if
you
follow
along
to
the
top
of
the
galea
no
i
droned
on
imperturbably
you
will
etc
i
got
tired
of
standing
and
talking
to
an
empty
house
but
at
last
they
got
up
apologising
and
making
for
the
door
i
entreated
them
not
to
mention
the
matter
my
fee
should
be
nominal
i
did
it
out
of
sheer
love
etc
they
thanked
me
again
and
would
have
said
more
but
i
added
blandly
you
know
your
way
out
they
assured
me
they
did
having
worked
in
the
place
for
years
and
more
i
thanked
god
and
sat
down
to
my
table
once
more
these
reports
of
conversations
are
rather
fatuous
yet
they
give
an
idea
of
the
sort
of
person
i
have
to
deal
with
and
also
the
sort
of
person
i
am
among
this
sort
of
person
housefly
for
weeks
past
we
have
all
been
in
a
terrible
flutter
scarcely
paralleled
by
the
outbreak
of
armageddon
in
august
the
spark
which
fired
almost
the
whole
building
was
a
letter
to
the
written
by
making
public
an
ignominious
confession
of
ignorance
on
the
part
of
entomologists
as
to
how
the
housefly
passed
the
winter
in
reply
many
correspondents
wrote
to
say
they
hibernated
and
one
man
was
even
so
temerarious
as
to
quote
to
us
entomologists
the
exact
latin
name
of
the
housefly
we
asked
for
specimens
and
enormous
numbers
of
flies
at
once
began
to
arrive
at
the
museum
alive
and
dead
and
not
a
housefly
among
them
so
there
was
a
terrible
howdedo
one
of
the
correspondents
was
named
masefield
not
masefield
the
poet
an
excited
dipterist
asked
i
reassured
him
i
a
good
mind
said
to
reply
to
this
chap
who
so
emphatic
and
give
him
a
whigging
only
he
climbing
down
a
bit
in
this
second
letter
in
issue
i
strongly
advocated
clemency
but
still
the
affair
goes
on
every
morning
sees
more
letters
and
more
flies
sent
by
all
sorts
of
persons
we
seem
to
have
set
the
whole
world
searching
for
houseflies
duchesses
signalmen
farmers
footmen
every
morning
each
fresh
batch
of
flies
is
mounted
on
pins
by
experts
in
the
setting
room
and
an
assistant
whole
time
is
devoted
to
identifying
arranging
listing
and
reporting
upon
the
new
arrivals
at
the
last
meeting
of
the
trustees
a
sample
collection
was
displayed
to
show
indubitably
that
the
insects
which
hibernate
in
houses
are
not
but
i
understand
the
trustees
were
appreciative
an
observant
eye
can
now
discover
state
visits
to
our
dipterists
from
interested
persons
carrying
their
flies
with
them
animated
discussions
in
the
corridor
knots
of
excited
enthusiasts
in
the
lavatory
in
the
library
everywhere
and
everywhere
the
subject
discussed
is
the
same
how
does
the
housefly
pass
the
winter
as
one
passes
one
catches
in
bakehouses
certainly
they
are
to
be
found
but
or
a
wistful
voice
i
wish
i
had
caught
that
one
in
my
bathroom
three
winters
ago
i
am
certain
it
was
a
housefly
the
doctor
himself
a
gallant
captain
wanders
from
room
to
room
stimulating
his
lieutenants
to
make
suggestions
and
examining
every
answer
to
the
great
interrogative
on
its
merits
no
matter
how
humble
or
insignificant
the
person
who
makes
it
then
of
an
afternoon
he
will
entirely
disappear
and
word
goes
round
that
he
has
set
forth
to
examine
a
rubbish
heap
in
soho
or
pimlico
as
the
afternoon
draws
to
its
close
someone
enquires
if
he
has
come
back
yet
next
morning
a
second
asks
if
i
had
seen
him
then
a
third
announces
mournfully
that
he
has
just
been
holding
conversation
with
him
but
that
nothing
at
all
was
found
in
the
rubbish
heap
the
great
sensation
of
all
occurred
last
week
when
somebody
ran
along
the
corridor
crying
that
had
just
found
a
housefly
in
his
room
we
were
all
soon
agog
with
the
news
and
the
excited
captain
was
presently
espied
setting
out
for
the
scene
of
operations
with
a
killing
bottle
and
net
the
insect
was
promptly
impounded
and
identified
as
a
veritable
a
consultation
being
held
to
sit
on
the
body
a
lady
finally
laid
information
that
two
forced
houseflies
hatched
the
day
before
had
escaped
from
her
possession
she
suggested
specimen
was
one
of
them
how
would
it
get
from
your
room
to
mr
she
was
immediately
asked
and
breathless
we
all
heard
her
answer
deliberately
and
quite
audibly
that
the
fugitive
may
have
gone
out
of
her
window
up
the
garden
and
in
by
window
it
may
have
gone
out
of
her
door
up
the
corridor
and
in
by
his
door
i
wanted
to
know
why
it
should
have
entered
room
as
he
is
not
a
dipterist
but
a
microlepidopterist
they
looked
at
me
sternly
and
we
slowly
dispersed
this
morning
the
came
to
me
with
a
newspaper
cutting
in
his
hand
saying
is
behindhand
he
handed
me
the
slip
it
was
a
clipping
from
about
a
sackful
of
flies
which
had
been
taken
from
wandsworth
clock
tower
in
a
state
of
hibernation
behindhand
i
asked
timidly
for
i
felt
that
all
the
story
was
not
in
front
of
me
why
yes
do
you
know
i
knew
nothing
but
was
prepared
for
anything
two
days
ago
he
informed
me
had
a
paragraph
about
this
headed
fugit
this
last
in
a
resentful
tone
as
tho
the
frivolous
reporter
were
attempting
to
discredit
our
mystery
there
was
a
long
pause
neither
of
us
spoke
then
he
slowly
said
i
wonder
why
is
so
behindhand
this
is
two
days
late
hulloa
old
friend
how
are
you
i
mean
my
diary
i
have
written
to
you
for
ever
so
long
and
my
silence
as
usual
indicates
happiness
i
have
been
passing
thro
an
unbroken
succession
of
calm
happy
days
walking
in
the
woods
with
my
darling
or
doing
a
little
gentle
gardening
on
coming
home
in
the
evening
and
the
war
has
been
centuries
away
later
on
towards
bedtime
e
reads
richard
jefferies
i
play
patience
and
makes
garments
for
priscilla
the
only
troubles
have
been
a
chimney
which
smokes
and
a
neighbour
dog
which
barks
at
night
so
to
be
sure
i
have
made
port
after
storm
at
last
and
none
too
soon
my
cheerfulness
has
been
rising
in
a
crescendo
till
it
broke
in
such
a
handsome
crest
of
pure
delight
that
i
can
not
think
of
going
to
bed
without
recording
it
after
sitting
on
the
wall
around
the
fountain
in
the
middle
of
trafalgar
square
eating
my
sandwiches
and
feeding
the
pigeons
with
the
crumbs
i
listened
for
a
moment
to
the
roar
of
the
traffic
around
three
sides
of
the
square
as
i
stood
in
the
centre
quite
alone
what
time
one
fat
old
pigeon
all
unconcerned
was
treading
another
it
was
an
extraordinary
experience
motor
horns
tooted
incessantly
and
it
seemed
purposelessly
so
that
one
had
the
fancy
that
all
london
was
out
for
a
it
was
a
great
british
victory
perhaps
or
peace
day
then
walked
down
whitehall
to
westminster
bridge
in
time
to
see
the
boat
start
upstream
for
kew
i
loitered
by
the
old
fellow
with
the
telescope
who
keeps
his
pitch
by
boadicea
i
saw
a
piper
of
the
scots
guards
standing
near
gazing
across
the
river
but
at
nothing
in
particular
just
idling
as
i
was
i
saw
another
man
sitting
on
the
stone
steps
and
reading
a
dirty
fragment
of
newspaper
i
saw
the
genial
man
in
charge
of
the
landing
stage
strolling
up
and
down
his
small
domain
chatting
jesting
spitting
and
making
fast
a
rope
or
so
everything
was
to
the
finger
tips
vividly
shining
pulsating
arrived
at
queen
hall
in
time
for
pachmann
recital
at
as
usual
he
kept
us
waiting
for
minutes
then
a
short
fat
man
strolled
casually
on
to
the
platform
and
everyone
clapped
violently
so
it
was
pachmann
a
dirty
greasy
looking
fellow
with
long
hair
of
dirty
grey
colour
reaching
down
to
his
shoulders
and
an
ugly
face
he
beamed
on
us
and
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
on
shrugging
them
until
his
eye
caught
the
music
stool
which
seemed
to
fill
him
with
amazement
he
stalked
it
carefully
held
out
one
hand
to
it
caressingly
and
finding
all
was
well
went
two
steps
backwards
clasping
his
hands
before
him
and
always
gazing
at
the
little
stool
in
mute
admiration
his
eyes
sparkling
with
pleasure
like
on
the
discovery
of
the
archeological
treasure
he
approached
once
more
bent
down
and
ever
so
gently
moved
it
about
of
an
inch
nearer
the
piano
he
then
gave
it
a
final
pat
with
his
right
hand
and
sat
down
he
played
nocturne
no
prelude
no
a
mazurka
and
two
etudes
of
chopin
and
schubert
impromptu
no
at
the
close
we
all
crowded
around
the
platform
and
gave
the
queer
gentleman
an
ovation
one
man
thrusting
up
his
hand
which
pachmann
generously
shook
as
desired
as
an
encore
he
gave
us
a
valse
valse
valse
he
exclaimed
ecstatically
jumping
up
and
down
in
his
seat
in
time
to
the
music
it
was
a
truly
remarkable
sight
on
his
right
the
clamorous
crowd
around
the
platform
on
his
left
the
seat
holders
of
the
orchestra
stalls
while
at
the
piano
bobbed
this
grubby
little
fat
man
playing
divine
chopin
divinely
well
at
the
same
time
rising
and
falling
in
his
seat
turning
a
beaming
countenance
first
to
the
right
and
then
to
the
left
crying
valse
valse
he
is
as
entertaining
as
a
tumbler
at
a
variety
hall
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
we
clapped
and
rattled
for
more
pachmann
meanwhile
standing
surrounded
by
his
idolaters
in
affected
despair
at
ever
being
able
to
satisfy
us
presently
he
walked
off
and
a
scuffle
was
half
visible
behind
the
scenes
between
him
and
his
agent
who
sent
him
in
once
more
the
applause
was
wonderful
as
soon
as
he
began
again
it
ceased
on
the
instant
and
as
soon
as
he
left
off
it
started
again
immediately
nothing
boisterous
or
rapturous
but
a
steady
determined
thunder
of
applause
that
came
regularly
and
evenly
like
the
roar
from
some
machine
spent
a
quiet
day
sat
at
my
escritoire
in
the
studio
this
morning
writing
an
essay
with
a
large
window
on
my
left
looking
on
to
woods
and
fields
with
linnets
greenfinches
cuckoos
calling
this
afternoon
while
e
rested
awhile
i
sat
on
the
veranda
in
the
sun
and
read
and
yes
i
in
harbour
at
last
i
be
the
last
to
deny
it
but
i
can
not
believe
it
will
last
it
too
good
to
last
and
it
all
too
good
to
be
even
true
e
is
too
good
to
be
true
the
home
is
too
good
to
be
true
and
this
quiet
restful
existence
is
too
wonderful
to
last
in
the
middle
of
a
great
war
it
just
a
little
deceitful
april
sunshine
that
all
had
tea
at
the
a
brilliant
summer
evening
afterwards
we
wandered
into
the
garden
and
shrubbery
and
sat
about
on
the
turf
of
the
lawn
chatting
and
smoking
played
with
a
rogue
of
a
white
tomcat
called
chatham
and
e
talked
about
our
neighbour
shamble
legs
about
garden
topics
etc
then
i
strolled
into
the
where
cynthia
was
playing
chopin
on
a
grand
piano
is
it
not
all
perfectly
lovely
how
delicious
to
be
silent
lolling
on
the
chesterfield
gazing
abstractedly
thro
the
lattice
window
and
listening
to
the
lulling
charities
of
nocturne
no
op
the
melody
in
the
latter
part
of
this
nocturne
took
me
back
at
once
to
a
cloudless
day
in
an
open
boat
in
the
bay
of
combemartin
with
oars
up
and
the
water
quietly
and
regularly
lapping
the
gunwales
as
we
rose
and
fell
a
state
of
the
most
profound
calm
and
happiness
took
possession
of
me
from
the
local
paper
a
comrade
in
the
gloucesters
writing
to
a
friend
at
mentions
that
pte
j
has
been
fatally
shot
in
action
j
was
well
known
here
for
years
as
an
especially
smart
young
newsvendor
what
a
bitter
disappointment
it
is
to
realise
that
people
the
most
intimately
in
love
with
one
another
are
really
separated
by
such
a
distance
a
woman
is
calmly
knitting
socks
or
playing
patience
while
her
husband
or
sweetheart
lies
dead
in
flanders
however
strong
the
tie
that
binds
them
together
yet
they
are
insufficiently
for
her
to
sense
even
a
catastrophe
and
she
must
wait
till
the
war
office
forsooth
sends
her
word
how
humiliating
that
the
war
office
must
do
what
love
can
not
human
love
seems
then
such
a
superficial
thing
every
person
is
a
distinct
egocentric
being
each
for
himself
and
the
devil
take
the
hindmost
ah
but
she
did
know
yes
but
she
to
have
known
mental
telepathy
and
clairvoyance
should
be
common
at
least
to
all
lovers
this
morning
in
bed
i
heard
a
man
with
a
milkcart
say
in
the
road
to
a
villager
at
about
battle
and
we
lost
six
cruisers
this
was
the
first
i
knew
of
the
battle
of
jutland
at
i
read
in
the
that
the
british
navy
had
been
defeated
and
thought
it
was
the
end
of
all
things
the
news
took
away
our
appetites
at
the
railway
station
the
was
more
cheerful
even
reassuring
and
now
at
the
battle
has
turned
into
a
merely
regrettable
indecisive
action
we
breathe
once
more
it
has
now
become
a
victory

that

my
gratitude
to
e
for
plucking
me
out
of
the
hideous
miseries
of
my
life
in
london
is
greater
than
i
can
express
if
i
were
the
cheap
hero
of
a
ladies
novel
i
should
immolate
my
journals
as
a
token
and
you
would
have
a
pretty
picture
of
a
pale
young
man
watching
his
days
go
up
in
smoke
by
the
fire
but
i
have
more
confidence
in
her
sterling
good
sense
and
if
i
can
not
be
loved
for
what
i
am
i
do
not
wish
to
be
loved
for
what
i
am
not
since
the
fateful
my
life
has
become
entirely
posthumous
i
live
now
in
the
grave
and
am
busy
furnishing
it
with
posthumous
joys
i
accept
my
fate
with
great
content
my
restless
ambition
lies
asleep
now
my
furious
is
anæsthetised
by
this
great
war
the
war
and
the
discovery
about
my
health
together
have
plucked
out
of
me
that
canker
of
i
sit
at
home
here
in
this
country
cottage
in
perfect
isolation
flattened
out
by
a
steam
hammer
tho
it
took
armageddon
to
do
it
yet
as
cheerful
and
busy
as
a
dormouse
laying
up
store
for
the
winter
for
i
am
almost
resigned
to
the
issue
in
the
knowledge
that
some
day
someone
will
know
perhaps
somebody
will
understand
and
immortal
powers
even
sympathise
the
quick
heart
quickening
from
the
heart
that
still
an
omniscient
caledonian
asked
me
where
are
the
celebes
are
they
or
of
the
sandwich
group
i
marked
him
down
at
once
as
my
legitimate
prey
sitting
back
in
my
chair
i
replied
slowly
in
my
most
offensive
manner
the
island
of
celebes
is
of
enormous
size
and
curious
shape
situated
in
the
malay
archipelago
the
caledonian
made
no
sign
instead
of
grinning
at
his
error
and
confessing
to
a
floater
he
endeavoured
to
carry
on
by
remarking
that
of
course
would
be
of
papua
just
for
all
the
world
as
if
his
error
was
a
minor
one
of
latitude
and
longitude
ignoring
his
comment
i
continued
from
the
zoogeographical
point
of
view
celebes
is
unequalled
in
importance
having
the
strangest
fauna
almost
of
any
island
on
the
face
of
the
globe
then
there
line
i
said
being
purposely
obscure
the
caledonian
said
nought
but
looked
hurt
it
was
so
obvious
that
he
did
know
and
it
was
so
obvious
that
i
knew
that
he
did
know
that
after
my
farcical
truculence
i
expected
the
tension
to
dissolve
in
laughter
yet
it
is
hard
for
a
caledonian
to
say
god
be
merciful
to
me
ignorant
devil
that
i
am
so
i
pursued
him
with
more
information
about
wallace
line
with
an
insouciant
air
as
much
as
to
say
line
of
course
you
heard
discussed
before
you
were
breached
some
do
say
you
know
that
the
line
is
my
eye
and
betty
martin
r
this
gave
him
his
first
opportunity
of
finding
his
feet
in
this
perilously
deep
water
so
he
said
promptly
eager
to
seem
knowledgeable
with
an
intelligent
rejoinder
as
yes
r
is
an
authority
on
fishes
i
assented
at
the
last
meeting
of
the
british
ass
he
tore
the
idea
to
shreds
the
drowning
caledonian
seized
at
any
straw
fishes
however
are
not
of
paramount
importance
in
cases
of
geographical
distribution
are
they
i
knew
he
was
thinking
of
fishes
but
i
did
not
illumine
him
and
merely
said
oh
yes
of
very
great
importance
at
which
he
looked
still
more
hurt
decamped
in
silence
and
left
me
conqueror
of
the
field
but
without
the
spoils
of
victory
it
was
impossible
to
bring
him
to
say
i
do
not
know
four
was
all
i
wanted
from
the
man
who
for
months
past
has
been
lecturing
me
on
all
things
from
music
and
the
drama
to
philosophy
painting
and
insects
the
cradle
came
a
few
days
ago
but
i
had
not
seen
it
until
this
morning
when
i
unlocked
the
cupboard
door
looked
in
and
shuddered
that
the
skeleton
in
our
cupboard
i
said
on
coming
down
to
breakfast
she
laughed
but
i
really
meant
it
e
keeps
a
blue
bowl
replenished
with
flaming
poppies
in
our
room
the
cottage
is
plagued
with
which
fly
in
at
night
and
get
among
the
clothes
and
bedlinen
this
morning
dressing
she
held
up
her
chemise
to
the
light
saying
i
always
do
this
you
can
see
their
little
heathen
bodies
then
against
the
light
is
she
charming
the
other
day
r
and
i
were
sitting
on
a
stile
on
the
uplands
in
perfect
summer
weather
and
talking
of
happy
days
before
the
war
he
was
in
khaki
and
i
was
resting
my
gammy
leg
as
we
talked
we
let
our
eyes
roam
resting
luxuriously
wherever
we
pleased
and
occasionally
interrupting
the
conversation
with
look
at
that
cow
scratching
herself
against
the
oak
or
do
you
see
the
oats
waving
in
the
distance
we
saw
a
man
and
a
boy
walking
up
towards
us
along
the
path
thro
the
corn
but
the
eye
having
momentarily
scrutinised
them
wandered
away
and
the
conversation
never
paused
when
next
i
looked
they
were
much
nearer
crossing
the
furrows
in
the
potato
field
in
fact
and
we
both
stopped
talking
to
watch
idly
the
boy
seemed
to
be
about
years
old
and
it
amused
us
to
see
his
great
difficulty
in
stepping
across
the
furrows
poor
little
chap
r
said
and
we
laughed
then
the
boy
stumbled
badly
and
all
at
once
the
man
lifted
his
and
beat
him
saying
step
between
the
furrows
and
again
step
between
the
furrows
our
enchanting
little
picture
was
transfigured
in
an
instant
the
charming
little
boy
was
a
natural
idiot
a
gross
hefty
creature
perhaps
years
of
age
very
short
and
very
thick
dressed
in
a
little
sailor
suit
i
said
heavens
and
r
looked
positively
scared
we
stood
aside
for
them
to
get
over
the
stile
the
boy
still
suffering
from
his
over
exertion
breathing
stertorously
like
a
horse
pulling
uphill
and
still
evidently
fearful
of
the
big
stick
behind
he
scrambled
over
the
stile
as
best
he
could
rolling
a
wild
eye
at
us
as
he
did
so
a
large
bulgy
eye
with
the
lower
lid
swollen
and
sore
like
the
eye
of
a
terrified
ox
on
the
way
to
the
slaughter
house
so
much
then
for
our
little
picture
of
charming
childhood
the
man
followed
close
at
his
heels
and
looked
at
me
with
stern
defiant
eyes
yes
that
is
my
son
his
eyes
declaimed
and
i
thank
you
to
avert
your
gaze
or
by
the
lord
i
beat
you
too
yellow
last
week
i
saw
a
yellow
cat
perched
up
quite
high
on
a
window
ledge
at
the
s
underground
station
in
celestial
detachment
from
the
crowd
of
serious
gentlemen
hustling
along
to
and
from
the
trains
he
had
his
back
turned
to
us
but
as
i
swept
past
in
the
stream
i
was
forced
to
look
back
a
moment
and
caught
the
outline
of
his
whiskers
it
made
me
smile
intensely
to
myself
and
secretly
i
gave
the
palm
to
the
cat
for
wisdom
this
war
is
so
great
and
terrible
that
hyperbole
is
impossible
and
yet
my
gorge
rises
at
those
fatuous
journalists
continually
prating
about
this
greatest
war
of
all
time
this
great
drama
this
world
catastrophe
unparalleled
in
human
history
because
it
is
easy
to
see
that
they
are
really
more
thrilled
than
shocked
by
the
immensity
of
the
war
they
indulge
in
a
vulgar
yankee
admiration
for
the
big
thing
why
call
this
shameful
filth
by
high
sounding
phrases
as
if
it
were
a
tragedy
from
euripides
we
ought
to
hush
it
up
not
brag
about
it
to
mention
it
with
a
blush
instead
of
spurting
it
out
garvin
for
example
positively
gloats
over
the
war
each
week
in
the
last
week
was
one
of
those
pivotal
occasions
on
which
destiny
seems
to
swing
and
so
on
every
week
you
can
hear
him
historical
glutton
smacking
his
lips
with
an
offensive
relish
for
my
part
i
never
seem
to
be
in
the
same
mind
about
the
war
twice
following
sometimes
i
am
wonderstruck
and
make
out
a
list
of
all
the
amazing
events
i
have
lived
to
see
since
august
and
sometimes
and
more
often
i
am
swollen
with
contempt
for
its
colossal
imbecility
and
sometimes
i
am
swept
away
with
admiration
for
all
the
heroism
of
the
war
or
by
some
particularly
noble
and
think
it
is
really
all
worth
while
then
and
more
frequently
i
remember
that
this
war
has
let
loose
on
the
world
not
only
barbarities
butcheries
and
crimes
but
lies
lies
lies
hypocrisies
deceits
ignoble
desires
for
such
as
no
one
before
ever
dreamed
existed
in
embryo
in
the
heart
of
human
beings
the
war
rings
the
changes
on
all
the
emotions
it
twangs
all
my
strings
in
turn
and
occasionally
all
at
once
so
that
i
scarcely
know
how
to
react
or
what
to
think
you
see
here
am
i
a
compulsory
spectator
and
all
i
can
do
is
to
reflect
a
zeppelin
brought
down
in
flames
that
lit
up
all
london
now
that
makes
me
want
to
write
like
garvin
but
a
foreign
correspondent
eager
discussion
of
italy
aspirations
in
the
trentino
how
russia
insists
on
a
large
slice
of
turkey
and
so
forth
makes
me
splutter
how
insufferably
childish
to
be
slicing
up
the
earth
surface
how
immeasureably
above
the
battle
i
am
at
times
what
a
prig
you
will
say
i
am
when
i
sneer
at
such
contemptible
little
devilries
as
the
bodies
trick
of
sending
over
a
little
note
warsaw
is
fallen
into
our
trenches
or
as
ours
in
reply
gorizia
there
is
no
difference
in
principle
between
the
case
of
a
man
who
loses
a
limb
in
the
service
of
his
country
and
that
of
the
man
who
loses
his
reason
both
have
an
obvious
claim
to
the
grateful
recognition
of
the
state
a
morning
paper
a
jejune
comment
like
this
makes
me
grin
like
a
gargoyle
hark
to
the
fellow
this
over
his
cup
of
tea
but
it
is
a
lesson
to
show
how
easily
and
quickly
we
have
all
adapted
ourselves
to
the
war
the
war
is
everything
it
is
noble
filthy
great
petty
degrading
inspiring
ridiculous
glorious
mad
bad
hopeless
yet
full
of
hope
i
do
know
what
to
think
about
it
i
hate
elderly
women
who
mention
their
legs
it
makes
me
shudder
i
had
two
amusing
conversations
this
morning
one
with
a
jealous
old
man
of
summers
who
in
spite
of
his
age
is
jealous
i
can
find
no
other
term
of
me
in
spite
of
mine
and
the
other
with
a
social
climber
i
always
tell
the
first
of
any
of
my
little
successes
and
regularly
hand
him
all
my
memoirs
as
they
appear
to
which
he
as
regularly
protests
that
he
reads
very
little
now
oh
never
mind
i
always
answer
gaily
you
take
it
and
read
it
going
down
in
the
train
it
will
amuse
you
he
submits
but
is
always
silent
next
time
i
see
him
a
little
admonitory
silence
or
i
mention
i
am
giving
an
address
at
and
he
says
oom
and
at
once
begins
his
reminiscences
which
i
have
heard
many
times
before
and
am
sometimes
tempted
to
correct
him
when
his
memory
failing
he
leaves
out
an
essential
portion
of
his
story
thus
do
crabbed
age
and
boastful
youth
tantalise
one
another
to
the
social
climber
i
said
slyly
you
seem
to
move
in
a
very
distinguished
entourage
during
your
week
ends
he
smiled
a
little
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
oh
i
have
a
few
nice
friends
you
know
now
i
am
sorry
but
though
i
scrutinised
this
and
arch
rider
very
closely
i
am
quite
unable
to
say
whether
that
smile
and
unwonted
diffidence
meant
simple
pleasure
at
the
now
certain
knowledge
that
i
was
duly
impressed
or
whether
it
was
genuine
confusion
at
the
thought
that
he
had
perhaps
been
overdoing
it
curiously
enough
all
bores
of
whatever
kind
make
a
dead
set
at
me
i
am
always
a
ready
listener
and
my
thrusts
are
always
gentle
hence
the
pyramids
i
constantly
act
as
phlebotomist
to
the
vanity
of
the
young
and
to
the
anecdotage
of
the
senile
and
senescent
i
stood
by
his
chair
and
looked
down
at
him
and
surveyed
carefully
the
top
of
his
head
neck
and
collar
and
with
admirable
restraint
and
calm
considered
my
most
reasonable
contempt
of
him
in
perfect
silence
we
remained
thus
while
i
looked
down
at
a
sore
spot
in
the
centre
of
his
calvarium
which
he
scratches
occasionally
and
toyed
with
the
fine
flower
of
my
scorn
but
it
is
a
dangerous
license
to
take
one
never
knows
to
clear
away
the
cobwebs
and
to
purge
my
soul
of
evil
thoughts
and
bitter
feelings
went
for
a
walk
this
evening
over
the
uplands
among
the
stubble
i
sat
down
for
a
while
with
my
back
against
the
corn
pook
and
listened
to
the
partridges
calling
then
wandered
around
the
edge
of
this
upland
field
with
the
wind
in
my
face
and
a
shower
of
delicious
fresh
rain
pattering
down
on
the
leaves
and
dry
earth
then
into
a
wood
among
tall
forest
beeches
and
a
few
giant
larches
where
i
rested
again
and
heard
a
woodpecker
tapping
out
its
message
aloft
this
ramble
in
beautiful
b
shire
country
restored
my
mental
and
spiritual
poise
i
came
home
serene
and
perfectly
balanced
my
equilibrium
was
something
like
the
just
perceptible
oscillation
of
tall
tops
on
the
heights
of
a
cliff
and
the
sea
below
with
a
just
perceptible
swell
on
a
calm
and
perfect
june
day
i
felt
exquisite
superb
i
could
have
walked
all
the
way
home
on
a
tight
rope
just
recently
i
have
been
going
fairly
strong
i
get
frequent
colds
and
sometimes
show
unpleasant
nerve
symptoms
but
i
take
a
course
of
arsenic
and
strychnine
every
month
or
so
in
tabloid
form
and
this
helps
me
over
bad
patches
under
the
beatific
influence
of
more
comfortable
health
the
rare
flower
of
my
ambition
has
raised
its
head
once
more
my
brain
has
bubbled
with
projects
to
wit
an
investigation
of
the
balancers
in
larval
urodeles
the
present
parlous
state
of
systematic
zoology
for
science
progress
the
anatomy
of
the
psocidæ
etc
the
strength
of
my
ambition
at
any
given
moment
is
the
measure
of
my
state
of
health
it
must
really
be
an
extraordinarily
tenacious
thing
to
have
hung
on
thro
all
my
recent
experiences
considerately
enough
this
great
crab
lets
go
of
my
big
toe
when
i
am
sunk
low
in
health
yet
pinches
devilishly
hard
as
now
when
i
am
well
bad
when
i
begin
to
speak
t
will
sometimes
interrupt
with
his
loud
rasping
voice
i
usually
submit
to
this
from
sheer
lack
of
lung
power
or
i
may
have
a
sore
throat
but
occasionally
after
the
fifth
or
sixth
interruption
i
lose
my
equanimity
and
refuse
to
give
him
ground
i
keep
straight
on
with
what
i
intended
to
say
only
in
a
louder
voice
he
assumes
a
voice
louder
still
but
not
to
be
denied
i
pile
pelion
on
ossa
and
finally
overwhelm
him
in
a
thunder
of
sound
for
example
the
other
day
i
begin
quietly
collecting
my
thoughts
to
tell
the
story
in
detail
i
went
to
the
ah
you
must
come
and
see
my
pictures
he
breaks
in
but
i
go
on
and
he
goes
on
and
as
i
talk
i
catch
phrases
peters
or
michael
angelo
or
botticelli
in
wondrous
antiphon
with
my
own
british
museum
and
i
saw
there
two
syracusan
tetradrachms
until
very
likely
i
reach
the
end
of
my
sentence
before
he
does
his
or
perhaps
his
rasp
drives
my
remarks
out
of
my
head
but
that
makes
no
difference
for
rather
than
give
in
i
go
on
improvising
in
a
louder
and
louder
voice
when
suddenly
at
length
made
aware
of
the
fact
that
i
am
talking
too
he
stops
leaving
me
bellowing
nonsense
at
the
top
of
my
voice
thus
and
i
much
admired
these
syracusan
tetradrachms
very
charming
indeed
i
like
them
the
syracusan
tetradrachms
i
mean
you
know
and
it
will
be
good
to
go
again
and
see
them
louder
if
possible
and
the
weather
keeps
dry
louder
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
keep
in
their
courses
if
the
slugs
on
the
thorn
loudest
he
stops
hears
the
last
few
words
of
my
remarks
pretends
to
be
appreciative
but
wonders
what
in
name
i
can
have
been
talking
about
this
is
the
sort
of
remark
i
like
to
make
someone
says
to
me
you
a
pessimist
ah
well
i
say
looking
infernally
deep
pessimism
is
a
good
policy
it
like
having
your
cake
and
eating
it
at
the
same
time
chorus
why
because
if
the
future
turns
out
badly
you
can
say
told
you
so
to
your
own
satisfaction
and
if
all
is
well
why
you
share
everyone
satisfaction
or
i
say
no
i
ca
swim
and
i
do
want
to
chorus
why
because
it
is
so
dangerous
chorus
why
the
infernally
wise
youth
for
several
reasons
if
you
are
a
swimmer
you
are
likely
to
be
oftener
near
water
and
oftener
in
danger
than
a
further
as
soon
as
you
can
swim
even
only
a
little
then
as
an
honourable
man
it
behoves
you
to
plunge
in
at
once
to
save
a
drowning
person
whereas
if
you
could
swim
it
would
be
merely
tempting
providence
is
it
sickening
yesterday
the
wind
was
taken
out
of
my
sails
racing
along
with
spinnaker
and
jib
feeling
pretty
fit
and
quite
excited
over
some
interesting
ectoparasites
just
collected
on
some
tinamous
i
suddenly
shot
into
a
menacing
dead
calm
that
stiflingly
still
atmosphere
which
precedes
a
typhoon
that
is
to
say
my
eye
caught
the
title
of
an
enormous
quarto
memoir
in
the
roy
edinburgh
the
histology
of
i
was
browsing
in
the
library
at
the
time
when
this
hit
me
like
a
carelessly
handled
gaff
straight
in
the
face
i
almost
ran
away
to
my
room
my
pink
form
just
received
amazes
me
to
be
a
soldier
incroyable
ma
foi
the
possibility
even
is
distracting
to
send
me
a
notice
requesting
me
to
prepare
myself
for
killing
men
why
i
should
feel
no
more
astonished
to
receive
a
war
office
injunction
under
dire
penalties
to
perform
miracles
to
move
mountains
to
raise
from
the
dead
my
reply
would
be
i
can
not
i
should
sit
still
and
watch
the
whole
universe
pass
to
its
destruction
rather
than
raise
a
hand
to
knife
a
fellow
this
may
be
poor
anæmic
but
there
it
is
a
positive
fact
there
are
moments
when
i
have
awful
misgivings
is
this
blessed
journal
worth
while
i
really
do
know
and
that
the
harassing
fact
of
the
matter
if
only
i
were
sure
of
myself
if
only
i
were
capable
of
an
impartial
view
but
i
am
too
fond
of
myself
to
be
able
to
see
myself
objectively
i
wish
i
knew
for
certain
what
i
am
and
how
much
i
am
worth
there
are
such
possibilities
about
the
situation
it
may
turn
out
tremendously
or
else
explode
in
a
soap
bubble
it
is
the
torture
of
tantalus
to
be
so
uncertain
i
should
be
relieved
to
know
even
the
worst
i
would
almost
gladly
burn
my
mss
in
the
pleasure
of
having
my
curiosity
satisfied
i
go
from
the
nadir
of
disappointment
to
the
zenith
of
hope
and
back
several
times
a
week
and
all
the
time
i
am
additionally
harassed
by
the
perfect
consciousness
that
it
is
all
petty
and
pusillanimous
to
desire
to
be
known
and
appreciated
that
my
ambition
is
a
morbid
diathesis
of
the
mind
i
am
not
such
a
fool
either
as
not
to
see
that
there
is
but
little
satisfaction
in
posthumous
fame
and
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
not
to
realise
that
all
fame
is
fleeting
and
that
the
whole
world
itself
is
passing
away
i
smile
with
sardonic
amusement
when
i
reflect
how
the
war
has
changed
my
status
before
the
war
i
was
an
interesting
invalid
now
i
am
a
lucky
dog
then
i
was
a
star
turn
in
tragedy
now
i
am
drowned
and
ignored
in
an
overcrowded
chorus
no
valetudinarian
was
ever
more
unpleasantly
jostled
out
of
his
it
is
difficult
to
accustom
myself
to
the
new
role
all
at
once
i
had
begun
to
lose
the
faculty
for
sympathising
in
others
griefs
it
is
hard
to
have
to
realise
that
in
all
this
slaughter
my
own
superfluous
life
has
become
negligible
and
scarcely
anyone
concern
but
my
own
in
this
colossal
which
is
developing
who
can
stay
to
consider
a
useless
mouth
am
i
not
a
comfortable
parasite
and
god
forgive
me
an
egotist
to
boot
the
war
is
searching
out
everyone
concentrating
a
beam
of
inquisitive
light
upon
everyone
mind
and
character
and
publishing
it
for
all
the
world
to
see
and
the
consequence
to
many
honest
folk
has
been
a
keen
personal
disappointment
we
ignoble
persons
had
thought
we
were
better
than
we
really
are
we
scarcely
anticipated
that
the
war
was
going
to
discover
for
us
our
emotions
so
despicably
small
by
comparison
or
our
hearts
so
riddled
with
selfish
motives
in
the
wild
race
for
security
during
these
dangerous
times
men
and
women
have
all
been
sailing
so
closehauled
to
the
wind
that
their
eyes
have
been
glued
to
their
own
forepeaks
with
never
a
thought
for
others
fathers
have
vied
with
one
another
in
procuring
safe
jobs
for
their
sons
wives
have
been
bitter
and
recriminating
at
the
security
of
other
wives
husbands
the
men
themselves
plot
constantly
for
staff
appointments
and
everyone
is
pulling
strings
who
can
bereavement
has
brought
bitterness
and
immunity
indifference
and
how
pathetically
some
of
us
cling
still
to
fragments
of
the
old
regime
that
has
already
passed
like
mariners
to
floating
wreckage
to
the
manner
of
the
conservatoire
amid
the
thunder
of
all
europe
being
broken
up
to
our
newspaper
gossip
and
parish
teas
to
our
cherished
aims
wealth
fame
success
in
spite
of
all
coelum
benson
and
his
trickling
comfortable
essays
shaw
and
his
scintillations
they
are
all
there
as
before
revolving
like
haggard
windmills
in
a
devastated
landscape
a
little
while
ago
i
read
in
the
local
newspaper
which
i
get
up
from
the
country
two
columns
concerning
the
accidental
death
of
an
old
woman
while
two
lines
were
used
to
record
the
death
of
a
townsman
at
the
front
from
an
aerial
dart
behold
this
poor
rag
staggering
along
under
the
burden
of
the
war
in
a
passionate
endeavour
to
preserve
the
interest
in
an
old
decease
yet
more
or
less
we
are
all
in
the
same
case
i
still
write
my
journal
and
play
patience
of
an
evening
and
an
old
lady
i
know
still
reads
as
before
the
short
items
of
gossip
in
the
papers
neglecting
articles
and
leaders
we
are
like
a
nest
of
frightened
ants
when
someone
lifts
the
stone
that
is
the
world
just
now
i
was
so
ashamed
of
having
to
fall
back
upon
such
ignominious
publications
for
my
literary
efforts
that
on
presenting
him
with
two
copies
i
told
the
following
lie
to
save
my
face
they
were
two
essays
of
mine
left
over
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
you
know
my
usual
channel
became
blocked
so
i
had
to
have
recourse
to
these
where
do
you
publish
as
a
rule
he
innocently
asked
oh
several
in
the
i
told
him
out
of
vanity
but
of
course
every
respectable
journal
now
has
closed
down
to
topics
i
lie
out
of
vanity
and
then
i
confess
to
lying
out
of
vanity
too
so
that
one
way
or
another
i
am
determined
to
make
kudos
out
of
myself
even
this
last
reflection
is
written
down
with
an
excessive
appreciation
of
its
wit
and
the
intention
that
it
shall
raise
a
smile
still
nothing
to
report
the
anxiety
is
telling
on
us
all
the
nurse
has
another
case
on
the
i
looked
at
myself
in
the
mirror
this
morning
nude
a
most
revolting
picture
an
emaciated
human
being
is
the
most
unlovely
thing
in
creation
some
time
ago
a
smart
errand
boy
called
out
bovril
after
me
in
the
street
on
my
way
to
the
station
met
two
robust
brawny
curates
on
the
way
to
the
daily
weekday
service
which
is
attended
only
by
two
decrepit
old
women
in
black
each
with
her
caught
up
to
her
breast
as
if
she
were
afraid
it
might
gallop
off
that
means
a
parson
apiece
and
in
war
time
too
my
sympathy
with
myself
is
so
unfailing
that
i
do
deserve
anybody
else
in
many
respects
however
this
journal
i
believe
gives
the
impression
that
i
behave
myself
in
the
public
gaze
much
worse
than
i
actually
do
you
must
remember
that
herein
i
let
myself
go
at
a
stretch
gallop
in
life
i
rein
in
i
am
almost
another
person
would
you
believe
it
e
says
i
am
full
of
quick
sympathy
with
others
and
extraordinarily
cheerful
nay
gay
verily
i
lead
a
curious
double
existence
among
most
people
i
pass
for
a
complaisant
amiable
furry
if
conceited
creature
here
i
stand
revealed
as
a
contemptuous
arrogant
malcontent
my
life
has
embittered
me
i
have
the
crabbed
temper
of
the
disappointed
man
insufficiently
developed
yet
to
be
very
plainly
visible
beneath
my
innate
affable
unassuming
humble
diffident
cheerful
characteristics
with
fools
on
every
hand
i
am
becoming
insolent
aggressive
last
evening
came
home
and
got
down
robert
buchanan
sonnet
when
he
returns
and
finds
the
world
so
drear
and
felt
constrained
to
read
it
out
to
e
i
poured
out
its
acid
sentiment
with
the
base
revenge
of
a
vitriol
thrower
and
then
became
quiescent
it
is
a
helpless
feeling
sitting
still
and
watching
circumstances
pounding
away
at
my
malleable
character
and
moulding
it
wrongly
american
we
have
a
delightful
american
neighbour
here
whose
life
revolves
like
the
of
an
engine
even
when
not
in
eruption
his
volcanic
energy
is
always
rumbling
and
can
be
heard
seeing
he
is
a
globe
trotter
i
was
surprised
to
observe
his
most
elaborate
precautions
for
catching
the
train
and
getting
a
seat
when
he
takes
his
wife
and
family
to
town
he
first
of
all
plants
himself
and
all
his
property
down
at
a
certain
carefully
selected
point
along
the
platform
as
if
he
were
in
the
wild
west
lying
in
wait
for
a
buffalo
then
as
the
train
comes
in
his
eye
fixes
on
an
empty
compartment
as
it
passes
and
he
dashes
off
after
it
in
furious
pursuit
up
the
platform
shouting
to
his
family
to
follow
him
having
lassooed
the
compartment
squaw
and
piccaninnies
are
hustled
in
as
if
there
was
not
a
moment
to
lose
what
time
the
suburban
englishmen
look
on
in
pain
and
silence
and
then
slowly
with
offensive
deliberation
enter
their
respective
carriages
another
neighbour
who
interests
me
is
mainly
notable
for
his
extraordinary
gait
he
is
a
man
with
a
large
round
head
a
large
round
dissolute
looking
face
and
fairly
broad
shoulders
below
which
everything
tapers
away
to
a
pair
of
tiny
feet
neatly
booted
these
two
little
feet
are
excessively
sensitive
to
road
surface
one
would
say
he
had
special
sense
organs
on
his
toes
to
judge
by
the
manner
in
which
he
picks
out
his
path
along
the
country
road
in
short
quick
fussy
steps
his
feet
seem
to
dissect
out
the
road
as
if
boning
a
herring
a
big
bunion
is
as
good
as
a
sense
organ
but
his
feet
are
too
small
and
elegant
the
second
nurse
arrived
great
air
raid
last
night
of
which
we
heard
nothing
thank
god
my
nerves
are
giving
way
under
the
strain
one
leg
the
left
drags
abominably
we
shall
want
a
as
well
as
a
perambulator
crawled
up
thro
the
to
the
uplands
and
sat
in
a
field
in
the
sun
with
my
back
against
a
haystack
i
was
so
immobile
in
my
dejection
that
flies
and
came
and
perched
about
me
this
made
me
furious
i
am
not
dead
yet
i
said
get
away
and
i
would
suddenly
drive
them
off
in
horrible
dejection
even
my
mental
powers
are
disintegrating
that
the
rub
some
quite
recent
incidents
i
can
not
remember
even
when
reminded
of
them
they
seem
to
have
passed
clean
out
of
my
mind
a
remarkable
sensation
this
my
sensibility
is
dulled
too
it
chagrins
me
to
find
that
my
present
plight
by
no
means
overwhelms
me
with
anguish
as
it
would
have
done
once
it
only
worries
me
i
am
just
a
worried
ox
the
numbness
in
my
right
hand
is
getting
very
trying
the
baby
puts
the
lid
on
it
all
ca
you
see
the
sordid
picture
i
can
and
it
haunts
me
to
be
paralysed
with
a
wife
and
child
and
no
money
ugh
retribution
proceeds
with
an
almost
mathematical
accuracy
of
measure
it
would
necessitate
a
vernier
rather
than
a
chain
there
is
no
mercy
in
cause
and
effect
it
is
inhuman
clockwork
every
single
act
expended
brings
one
its
precise
equivalent
in
return
still
nothing
to
report
i
am
astonished
at
the
false
impression
these
entries
give
of
myself
the
picture
is
incomplete
anyhow
it
represents
the
cloud
of
forebodings
over
my
inner
self
but
does
not
show
the
outward
front
i
present
to
others
this
is
one
of
almost
constant
gaiety
unforced
and
quite
natural
ask
e
who
said
yesterday
i
was
like
a
schoolboy
camerade
i
give
you
my
hand
i
give
you
my
love
more
precious
than
money
i
give
you
myself
before
preaching
or
law
will
you
give
me
yourself
will
you
come
travel
with
me
shall
we
stick
by
each
other
as
long
as
we
live
she
cut
this
out
of
her
copy
of
walt
whitman
and
gave
it
me
soon
after
our
engagement
it
is
very
precious
to
me
on
on
the
doctor
advice
i
went
away
by
the
sea
alone
my
nerves
being
all
unstrung
for
an
account
of
the
miseries
of
this
journey
see
a
wire
to
say
susan
arrived
all
well
home
again
with
my
darling
she
is
the
most
wonderful
darling
woman
our
love
is
for
always
the
baby
is
a
monster
the
fact
that
i
ca
write
finally
bottles
me
up
damn
damn
damn
if
only
i
can
get
my
essay
on
journal
writers
done
e
goes
on
well
i
have
a
thousand
things
to
say
still
awaiting
a
reprieve
i
hate
alarming
the
doctor
he
such
a
cheerful
man
so
i
conceal
my
symptoms
quite
a
collection
by
now
the
prospect
of
breaking
the
news
to
her
makes
me
miserable
i
hide
away
as
much
as
possible
lest
she
should
see
i
speak
when
she
is
well
again
life
has
been
very
treacherous
to
me
this
the
greatest
treachery
of
all
but
i
do
care
i
exult
over
it
last
night
i
lay
awake
and
listened
to
the
wind
in
the
trees
and
was
full
of
exultation
now
i
can
only
talk
but
nobody
to
talk
to
shall
hire
a
row
of
broomsticks
more
and
more
the
war
appears
to
me
a
tragic
hoax
e
has
had
a
and
is
in
bed
again
however
sclerotic
my
nerve
tissue
i
feel
as
flaccid
as
a
jelly
my
god
how
i
loathe
the
prospect
of
death
i
must
have
some
music
or
i
shall
hear
the
paralysis
creeping
that
is
why
i
lie
in
bed
and
whistle
my
dear
brown
what
am
i
to
do
i
like
to
dramatise
myself
like
that
it
is
an
anodyne
i
feel
as
if
i
were
living
alone
on
ascension
island
with
the
tide
coming
up
continuously
up
and
up
and
up
she
has
known
from
the
beginning
m
warned
her
to
marry
me
how
brave
and
loyal
of
her
what
an
ass
i
have
been
i
am
overwhelmed
with
feelings
of
shame
and
and
sorrow
for
her
she
is
quite
cheerful
and
an
enormous
help
what
a
wreck
my
existence
has
become
and
dragging
down
others
with
me
if
only
i
could
rest
assured
that
after
i
am
dead
these
journals
will
be
tenderly
cared
for
as
tenderly
as
this
blessed
infant
it
would
be
cruel
if
even
after
i
have
paid
the
last
penalty
my
efforts
and
sufferings
should
continue
to
remain
unknown
or
disregarded
what
i
would
give
to
know
the
effect
i
shall
produce
when
published
i
am
tortured
by
two
doubts
whether
these
mss
the
labour
and
hope
of
many
years
will
survive
accidental
loss
and
whether
they
really
are
of
any
value
i
have
no
faith
in
either
in
fits
of
panic
i
keep
saying
to
myself
my
dear
brown
what
am
i
to
do
but
where
is
brown
brown
you
devil
where
are
you
to
think
how
i
have
acted
the
prince
to
her
when
really
i
am
only
a
beggar
a
little
better
and
more
cheerful
altho
my
impregnable
colon
still
holds
out
it
would
be
nice
if
a
physician
from
london
one
of
these
days
were
to
gallop
up
hotspur
tether
his
horse
to
the
gate
post
and
dash
in
waving
a
reprieve
the
discovery
of
a
cure
i
was
in
an
impish
mood
and
said
oh
dear
i
full
of
misery
do
be
silly
she
said
so
am
i
e
has
been
telling
me
some
of
her
emotions
during
and
after
her
fateful
visit
to
my
doctor
just
before
our
marriage
he
did
not
spare
her
and
even
estimated
the
length
of
my
life
after
i
had
once
taken
to
my
bed
about
months
i
remember
his
consulting
room
so
well
all
its
furniture
and
the
photograph
of
madam
blavatsky
over
the
door
and
i
picture
her
to
myself
sitting
opposite
to
him
in
a
sullen
silence
listening
to
the
whole
lugubrious
story
then
she
said
at
last
all
this
wo
make
any
difference
to
me
she
went
home
to
her
mother
in
a
dream
along
the
streets
i
have
followed
so
often
i
can
follow
all
her
footsteps
in
imagination
and
keep
on
retracing
them
it
hurts
but
i
do
so
because
it
seems
to
make
her
some
amends
for
my
being
childishly
unconscious
at
the
time
poor
darling
woman
if
only
i
had
known
my
instinct
was
right
i
felt
in
my
bones
it
was
wrong
to
marry
yet
here
was
m
urging
me
on
you
marry
her
mother
said
to
her
i
stand
by
you
which
was
right
royal
of
her
there
followed
some
trying
months
of
married
life
with
this
white
hot
secret
in
her
bosom
as
a
barricade
to
perfect
intimacy
me
she
saw
always
under
this
cloud
of
crude
disgusting
pathos
making
her
say
a
hundred
times
to
herself
he
know
then
zeppelin
raids
and
a
few
symptoms
began
to
grow
obvious
until
what
before
she
had
to
take
on
trust
from
the
doctor
came
diabolically
true
before
her
eyes
thank
god
that
all
over
at
last
i
know
her
now
for
all
she
is
worth
her
loyalty
and
devotion
her
courage
and
strength
if
only
i
had
something
to
give
her
in
return
something
more
than
the
dregs
of
a
life
and
a
constitutional
pessimism
i
greatly
desire
to
make
some
sacrifice
but
i
am
so
poor
these
days
so
very
much
a
pauper
on
her
charity
there
is
no
sacrifice
i
can
make
even
my
life
would
scarcely
be
a
sacrifice
in
the
circumstances
it
is
hard
not
to
be
able
to
give
when
one
to
give
in
the
doldrums
tired
of
this
damnable
i
am
being
gently
smothered
under
a
mountain
of
feathers
i
should
like
to
engage
upon
some
cold
hard
glittering
intellectualism
i
want
to
read
kant
i
said
the
baby
slept
e
was
sewing
and
n
writing
letters
i
leaned
back
in
my
armchair
beside
the
bookshelf
and
began
to
read
out
the
titles
of
my
books
in
a
loud
voice
my
dear
e
said
i
am
caressing
my
past
i
answered
wiedersheim
anatomy
of
smith
woodward
why
it
like
visiting
old
prospects
and
seeing
how
the
moss
has
grown
over
the
stones
i
hummed
a
comic
song
and
then
said
as
i
ca
burn
the
house
down
i
shall
go
to
bed
n
you
can
talk
if
you
like
it
wo
interfere
e
he
talking
to
his
besoms
certainly
i
said
to
n
e
you
ought
to
have
said
you
i
blew
out
my
cheeks
and
e
laughed
n
how
do
you
spell
i
told
her
wrongly
and
e
said
i
was
in
a
devilish
mood
if
we
say
that
we
have
no
sin
i
chanted
in
reply
we
deceive
ourselves
and
the
truth
is
not
in
us
i
next
gave
a
bit
out
of
a
speech
by
disraeli
with
exaggerated
rhetorical
gestures
e
with
pity
poor
young
man
presently
she
came
over
and
in
a
tired
way
put
her
arms
around
my
neck
so
i
immediately
began
to
sing
rock
of
ages
cleft
for
me
in
the
bass
which
immediately
reminded
me
of
dear
old
dad
whose
favourite
hymn
it
was
then
i
imitated
the
baby
and
then
to
bed
fretful
and
very
bitter
i
wish
i
could
die
of
heart
failure
and
at
once
what
a
luxury
that
would
be
as
compared
with
my
present
prospect
a
tomtit
on
the
fence
this
morning
made
me
dissolve
in
tears
i
believe
i
remember
tomtits
in
shire
put
on
a
gramophone
record
and
ugh
but
i
too
sick
to
write
the
shock
i
gave
my
spinal
column
in
up
in
the
lakes
undoubtedly
activity
among
the
bacteria
luck
for
you
i
of
all
persons
to
concuss
my
spine
i
listen
to
the
kettle
singing
i
look
at
the
pictures
in
the
fire
read
a
bit
ask
what
time
it
is
see
the
baby
topped
and
tailed
yawn
blow
my
nose
put
on
a
gramophone
record
i
have
the
idea
of
passing
on
the
midnight
with
no
pain
to
the
tune
of
some
healing
ragtime
the
anniversary
of
our
engagement
day
two
years
ago
how
mad
the
idea
of
marriage
seemed
to
me
and
my
instinct
was
right
if
only
i
had
known
yet
she
says
she
does
not
regret
anything
this
morning
i
turned
to
read
with
avidity
accounts
of
the
last
hours
of
keats
gibbon
oscar
wilde
and
baudelaire
i
gained
astonishing
comfort
out
of
this
especially
in
the
last
who
died
of
in
a
brussels
hospital
e
is
awfully
courageous
and
as
usual
ready
to
do
everything
in
her
power
how
can
i
ever
express
sufficient
gratitude
to
these
two
dear
women
and
my
wife
above
all
for
casting
in
their
lot
knowingly
with
mine
i
believe
i
am
good
for
another
months
without
abnormal
worries
just
now
of
course
the
slug
ai
exactly
on
the
thorn
on
the
cabbage
in
fact
as
e
suggested
the
grasshopper
is
much
of
a
burden
and
the
voice
of
the
turtle
has
gone
from
my
land
where
did
all
these
bible
phrases
come
from
the
first
bark
of
the
wolf
god
save
us
is
all
the
animal
kingdom
sliding
down
my
penholder
was
heard
with
the
reduction
in
her
work
and
i
suspect
there
worse
to
come
with
a
sovereign
already
only
worth
the
baby
touch
is
the
most
harrowing
of
all
if
we
were
childless
we
should
be
merely
unfortunate
but
an
infant
am
receiving
ionisation
treatment
from
an
electrical
therapeutist
a
quack
he
is
a
sort
of
electrician
still
if
he
mends
my
bells
kiss
his
boots
as
for
he
is
no
better
than
a
byreman
and
i
call
him
hodge
this
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
felt
driven
to
act
behind
the
back
of
the
profession
in
being
desperate
and
m
worse
than
a
headache
i
greedily
and
credulously
sucked
in
the
advice
of
my
proprietor
and
went
to
see
a
homœopathist
in
finsbury
circus
he
proved
to
be
a
charlatan
at
a
time
and
tho
i
realised
it
at
once
i
religiously
travelled
about
for
a
month
or
more
with
tinctures
and
i
could
write
a
book
on
the
doctors
i
have
known
and
the
blunders
they
have
made
about
me
the
therapeutist
took
me
for
i
feel
i
am
what
a
wreck
i
am
and
it
is
so
agreeable
to
be
able
to
write
again
that
i
write
now
for
the
sheer
physical
pleasure
of
being
able
to
use
a
pen
and
form
letters
adventure
in
search
of
about
the
end
of
september
i
began
to
feel
so
ill
that
nurse
went
for
the
doctor
who
assured
me
that
e
was
all
right
i
need
not
worry
you
go
away
at
once
and
get
some
fresh
air
and
so
forth
i
feel
quite
ill
i
said
struggling
to
break
the
news
sort
of
nervous
he
enquired
run
down
i
should
get
right
away
at
once
i
began
tentatively
well
i
have
a
rather
long
medical
history
and
perhaps
you
might
care
to
read
the
certificate
of
my
london
doctor
i
went
to
my
escritoire
and
returned
with
m
letter
addressed
to
the
examining
mr
b
hodge
pulled
out
the
missive
studied
the
brief
note
carefully
and
long
at
the
same
time
drawing
in
his
breath
deeply
and
gnawing
the
back
of
his
hand
i
know
all
about
it
i
said
to
relieve
him
is
it
quite
certain
about
this
disease
he
said
presently
you
are
very
young
for
it
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
and
he
began
to
put
me
thro
the
usual
tricks
i
should
go
right
away
at
once
he
said
and
go
on
with
your
arsenic
and
whatever
you
do
do
worry
your
wife
is
all
right
after
beseeching
him
to
keep
silence
about
it
as
i
thought
she
did
not
know
i
shewed
him
out
and
locked
up
the
certificate
again
next
morning
i
felt
thoroughly
cornered
i
was
not
really
fit
enough
to
travel
my
hand
and
leg
were
daily
growing
more
and
more
paralysed
and
j
wired
to
say
she
could
not
put
me
up
as
they
were
going
away
for
the
week
end
so
i
wired
back
engaging
rooms
as
with
the
nurse
in
the
house
and
e
as
she
was
i
simply
could
not
stay
at
home
on
the
way
to
the
station
i
was
still
in
two
minds
whether
or
not
to
pull
the
taxi
up
at
the
nursing
home
and
go
inside
but
harassing
debate
as
it
was
our
rapidly
diminishing
bank
balance
finally
drove
me
on
came
up
to
london
with
me
and
sought
out
a
comfortable
corner
seat
but
by
the
time
the
train
left
a
mother
and
a
crying
child
had
got
in
and
everywhere
else
was
full
a
girl
opposite
who
saw
hand
me
a
brandy
flask
and
knew
i
was
ill
looked
at
me
compassionately
at
reading
another
woman
with
a
baby
got
in
and
both
babies
cried
in
chorus
jangling
my
nerves
to
bits
until
i
got
out
into
the
corridor
by
a
miracle
not
falling
down
with
one
leg
very
feeble
and
treacherous
all
seats
were
taken
excepting
a
compartment
where
i
looked
in
enviously
at
a
lucky
youth
stretched
out
asleep
full
length
along
the
empty
seat
all
the
people
and
the
noise
of
the
train
began
to
make
me
fret
so
i
sought
out
the
repose
of
a
lavatory
where
i
remained
eating
sandwiches
and
an
apple
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
it
was
good
to
be
alone
later
on
i
discovered
an
empty
seat
in
a
compartment
occupied
by
persons
whose
questionable
appearance
my
short
sight
entirely
failed
to
make
me
aware
of
until
i
got
inside
with
them
they
were
a
family
of
sheenies
father
mother
and
three
children
whose
joint
emanations
in
a
railway
carriage
made
an
effluvium
like
to
kill
a
regiment
of
guards
they
were
end
pawnbrokers
or
dealers
in
clothes
i
was
too
nervous
to
appear
rude
by
immediately
so
i
said
politely
to
the
man
clad
in
furs
is
that
seat
taken
he
affected
to
be
almost
asleep
so
i
repeated
he
stared
at
me
and
then
said
oh
yes
but
you
can
have
it
for
a
bit
if
you
like
i
sat
down
timorously
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
seat
and
stared
at
but
could
not
read
my
newspaper
out
of
sheer
nervous
apprehension
my
sole
idea
was
to
get
out
as
soon
as
i
decorously
could
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
observed
the
three
children
two
girls
and
a
boy
all
garbed
in
black
clothes
and
wearing
large
clumsy
boots
with
nails
and
scutes
on
the
soles
the
girls
had
large
inflorescences
of
bushy
hair
which
they
swung
about
as
they
turned
their
heads
and
made
me
shudder
the
face
was
like
a
brown
shrivelled
apple
topped
with
a
black
bonnet
and
festooned
on
each
side
with
ringlets
of
curly
dark
hair
around
her
neck
a
fur
tippet
as
i
live
clothes
dealers
from
whitechapel
the
man
i
dare
not
look
at
i
sat
beside
him
and
merely
imagined
at
i
got
a
decent
seat
and
arrived
at
t
jaded
but
still
alive
with
no
one
to
meet
me
decent
rooms
on
the
next
morning
j
went
away
for
the
week
end
and
i
could
not
possibly
explain
how
ill
i
was
she
might
have
stayed
at
home
to
preserve
my
sanity
saturday
afternoon
took
a
desperate
remedy
by
hiring
a
and
travelling
to
torquay
and
back
babbacombe
on
the
sunday
feeling
suddenly
ill
i
sent
for
the
local
medico
whom
i
received
in
the
drab
little
room
by
lamplight
after
dinner
i
a
tingling
in
my
right
hand
i
said
that
drives
me
nearly
silly
and
on
the
soles
of
your
feet
he
asked
at
once
i
assented
and
he
ran
thro
at
once
all
the
symptoms
in
series
i
see
you
know
what
my
trouble
is
i
said
shyly
and
we
chatted
a
little
about
the
war
about
disease
and
i
told
him
of
the
recent
memoir
on
the
histology
of
the
disease
in
the
roy
edin
which
interested
him
then
he
went
away
again
very
amiable
very
polite
an
obvious
on
monday
at
went
up
to
to
tea
as
previously
arranged
but
found
the
house
shut
up
so
returned
to
my
rooms
in
a
rage
after
tea
having
read
the
newspapers
inside
out
sat
by
the
open
window
looking
out
on
to
the
marine
parade
it
was
dusk
a
fine
rain
was
falling
and
the
parade
and
were
deserted
save
for
an
occasional
figure
hurrying
past
with
mackintosh
and
umbrella
suddenly
as
i
sat
looking
out
on
this
doleful
scene
a
dirge
from
nowhere
in
particular
sounded
on
my
ears
which
i
soon
recognised
as
robin
adair
sung
very
and
very
by
a
woman
with
a
flute
obligato
played
by
some
second
person
the
tide
was
right
up
and
the
little
waves
murmured
listlessly
at
long
intervals
never
before
i
think
have
i
been
plunged
into
such
an
abyss
of
acute
misery
next
day
the
wire
came
but
it
was
too
late
the
day
after
that
i
was
worse
a
single
ray
of
sunshine
being
the
rediscovery
of
the
family
from
whitechapel
taking
the
air
together
on
the
front
this
dreary
party
was
traipsing
along
the
parents
in
their
furs
giving
an
occasional
glance
at
the
sea
uncomfortably
as
if
they
only
noticed
it
was
wet
and
the
children
still
in
black
and
still
wearing
their
scuted
boots
obviously
a
little
uncomfortable
in
a
place
so
clean
and
windswept
i
think
they
all
came
to
the
seaside
out
of
decorum
and
for
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
they
could
afford
it
like
other
folk
and
that
was
as
profitable
a
business
as
another
on
thursday
returned
home
as
i
was
afraid
of
being
taken
ill
and
having
to
go
into
the
public
hospital
arrived
home
and
went
to
bed
and
here
we
are
till
on
months
sick
leave
however
the
swingeing
urtication
in
my
hands
and
feet
has
now
almost
entirely
abated
and
i
went
out
with
e
and
the
perambulator
i
walked
down
the
bottom
of
the
road
and
hung
over
some
wooden
railings
a
little
village
aged
not
more
than
was
hovering
about
near
me
while
i
gazed
abstractedly
across
the
park
at
the
trees
presently
she
crawled
through
the
railings
into
the
field
and
picked
up
a
few
dead
leaves
a
baby
picking
up
dead
leaves
then
she
threw
them
down
and
kicked
them
then
moved
on
again
rustling
about
intermittently
like
a
winter
thrush
in
the
shrubbery
at
last
she
had
stumbled
around
to
where
i
was
leaning
over
the
railings
she
stood
immediately
in
front
of
me
and
silently
looked
up
with
a
steady
reproachful
gaze
ai
you
you
till
i
could
bear
her
inquisitorial
gaze
no
longer
and
so
went
and
hung
over
some
more
railings
further
on
he
asked
for
a
tennyson
she
immediately
went
upstairs
in
the
dark
lit
a
match
and
got
it
for
him
he
asked
for
a
shakespeare
and
without
a
moment
hesitation
she
went
upstairs
again
lit
another
match
and
got
that
for
him
and
i
believe
if
he
had
said
rats
she
would
have
shot
out
silently
into
the
dark
and
tried
to
catch
one
for
him
only
a
woman
is
capable
of
such
service
you
did
not
come
and
marching
time
drew
on
and
wore
me
numb
yet
less
for
loss
of
your
dear
presence
there
than
that
i
thus
found
lacking
in
your
make
that
high
compassion
which
can
overbear
reluctance
for
pure
sake
grieved
i
as
the
stroked
its
you
did
not
come
i
thoroughly
enjoy
hardy
poetry
for
its
masterfulness
for
his
sheer
muscular
compulsion
over
the
words
and
sentences
in
his
lines
he
yokes
the
recalcitrant
words
together
and
drives
them
along
mercilessly
with
something
that
looks
like
simple
brute
strength
witness
the
triumphant
last
line
in
the
above
where
the
words
are
absolute
bondslaves
to
his
exact
meaning
his
indomitable
will
all
this
pleases
me
the
more
for
i
know
to
my
cost
what
stubborn
sullen
hephæstian
beasts
words
and
clauses
can
sometimes
be
it
is
nice
to
see
them
punished
hardy
poetry
is
michael
angelo
rather
than
greek
browning
not
tennyson
what
a
day
after
a
night
of
fog
signals
i
awoke
this
morning
to
find
it
still
foggy
and
the
ground
covered
with
a
grey
rime
all
day
the
fog
has
remained
i
look
out
now
thro
the
yellowish
atmosphere
across
a
field
which
is
frosted
over
the
grass
and
brambles
stiff
and
glassy
my
back
is
aching
and
the
cold
is
so
intense
that
unless
i
crouch
over
the
fire
hands
and
feet
become
immediately
all
day
i
have
crouched
over
the
fire
reading
newspapers
listening
to
fog
signals
and
the
screaming
of
the
baby
i
have
been
in
a
torpor
like
a
bat
in
a
cavern
really
dead
yet
automatically
hanging
on
to
life
by
my
hind
legs
to
stand
upon
one
guard
against
death
exasperates
her
malice
and
protracts
our
sufferings
landor
the
parson
called
over
the
christening
of
the
baby
i
told
him
i
was
an
agnostic
there
are
several
interesting
lines
of
thought
down
here
he
said
wearily
passing
his
hand
over
his
eyes
i
know
several
men
more
enthusiastic
over
fleas
and
worms
than
this
phlegmatic
priest
over
jesus
christ
the
reason
why
i
do
not
spend
my
days
in
despair
and
my
nights
in
hopeless
weeping
simply
is
that
i
am
in
love
with
my
own
ruin
i
therefore
deserve
no
sympathy
and
probably
sha
get
it
my
own
profound
is
enough
i
am
so
abominably
that
no
smallest
detail
in
this
tragedy
eludes
me
day
after
day
i
sit
in
the
theatre
of
my
own
life
and
watch
the
drama
of
my
own
history
proceeding
to
its
close
pray
god
the
curtain
falls
at
the
right
moment
lest
the
play
drag
on
into
some
long
and
tedious
anticlimax
we
all
like
to
dramatise
ourselves
byron
was
dramatising
himself
when
in
a
fit
of
rhetorical
he
wrote
oh
could
i
feel
as
i
have
felt
or
be
what
i
have
been
or
weep
as
i
could
once
have
wept
many
a
vanished
scene
shelley
too
being
an
artist
could
not
stand
insensible
to
his
own
tragedy
and
francis
thompson
suggests
that
he
even
anticipated
his
own
end
from
a
passage
in
and
if
you
ca
swim
beware
of
providence
did
no
earthly
thompson
asks
sound
in
his
ears
as
he
wrote
it
in
any
event
it
was
an
admirable
ending
from
the
dramatic
point
of
view
destiny
is
often
a
superb
dramatist
what
more
perfect
than
the
death
of
rupert
brooke
at
scyros
in
the
ægean
the
lives
of
some
men
are
works
of
art
perfect
in
form
in
development
and
in
climax
yet
how
frequently
a
life
eminently
successful
or
even
eminently
ruinous
is
also
an
unlovely
sordid
ridiculous
or
vulgar
affair
every
one
will
concede
that
it
must
be
a
hard
thing
to
be
commonplace
and
vulgar
even
in
misfortune
to
discover
that
the
tragedy
of
your
own
precious
life
has
been
dramatically
bad
that
your
life
even
in
its
ruins
is
but
a
poor
thing
and
your
own
miseries
pathetic
from
their
very
insignificance
that
you
are
only
jones
with
chronic
indigestion
rather
than
guy
de
maupassant
mad
or
coleridge
with
a
great
intellect
being
slowly
dismantled
by
opium
if
only
i
could
order
my
life
by
line
and
level
if
i
could
control
or
create
my
own
destiny
and
mould
it
into
some
marble
perfection
in
short
if
life
were
an
art
and
not
a
lottery
in
the
lives
of
all
of
us
how
many
wasted
efforts
how
many
wasted
opportunities
false
starts
blind
how
many
lost
days
and
man
life
is
but
a
paltry
three
score
years
and
ten
pitiful
short
commons
indeed
sometimes
as
i
lean
over
a
gate
or
gaze
stupidly
into
the
fire
i
garner
a
contentment
in
making
ideal
reconstructions
of
my
life
selecting
my
parents
the
date
and
place
of
my
birth
my
gifts
my
education
my
mentors
and
what
portions
out
of
the
infinity
of
knowledge
shall
gain
a
place
within
my
mind
that
sacred
to
be
zealously
preserved
and
enthusiastically
cultivated
whereas
my
mind
is
now
a
wilderness
in
which
all
kinds
of
useless
growths
have
found
an
ineradicable
foothold
i
am
exasperated
to
find
i
have
by
heart
the
long
addresses
of
a
lot
of
dismal
business
correspondents
and
yet
ca
remember
the
last
chapters
of
ecclesiastes
what
a
waste
of
there
it
irks
me
to
be
acquainted
even
to
nausea
with
the
spot
in
which
i
live
i
whose
feet
have
never
traversed
even
so
much
as
this
little
island
much
less
carried
me
in
triumph
to
timbuctoo
honolulu
rio
rome
this
continuous
preoccupation
with
self
sickens
me
as
i
look
back
over
these
entries
it
is
inconceivable
that
i
should
be
here
steadily
writing
up
my
ego
day
by
day
in
the
middle
of
this
disastrous
war
yesterday
i
had
a
move
on
life
wearies
me
i
am
sick
of
myself
and
life
this
beastly
world
with
its
beastly
war
and
hate
makes
me
restless
dissatisfied
and
full
of
a
longing
to
be
quit
of
it
i
am
as
full
of
unrest
as
an
autumn
swallow
my
soul
i
said
to
them
at
breakfast
with
a
sardonic
grin
is
like
a
greyhound
in
the
slips
i
shall
have
to
wear
heavy
boots
to
prevent
myself
from
soaring
i
have
such
an
uplift
on
me
that
i
could
carry
a
horse
a
dog
a
cat
if
you
tied
them
on
to
my
homing
spirit
and
so
transformed
my
ascension
into
an
adventure
out
of
baron
munchausen
with
a
gasconnade
of
contempt
i
should
like
to
turn
on
my
heel
and
march
straight
out
of
this
wretched
world
at
once
this
book
makes
me
of
all
people
and
especially
just
now
groan
inwardly
i
am
at
a
loss
he
says
referring
to
the
and
how
to
describe
the
success
of
the
work
without
betraying
the
vanity
of
the
writer
my
book
was
on
every
table
and
almost
on
every
toilette
it
makes
me
bite
my
lips
rousseau
and
his
criticism
of
i
sighed
as
a
lover
i
obeyed
as
a
son
and
gibbon
on
his
dignity
in
reply
make
one
of
the
most
ludicrous
incidents
in
literary
history
that
extraordinary
man
whom
i
admire
and
pity
should
have
been
less
precipitate
in
condemning
the
moral
character
and
conduct
of
a
stranger
oh
my
giddy
aunt
is
this
still
i
am
glad
you
did
not
marry
her
we
could
ill
spare

madam
daughter
that
wonderful
vivacious
and
warmhearted
woman
after
the
morning
has
been
occupied
with
the
labours
of
the
library
i
wish
to
unbend
rather
than
exercise
my
mind
and
in
the
interval
between
tea
and
supper
i
am
far
from
disdaining
the
innocent
amusement
of
a
game
of
cards
how
jane
austen
would
have
laughed
at
him
the
passage
reminds
me
of
the
rev
collins
saying
had
i
been
able
i
should
have
been
only
too
pleased
to
give
you
a
song
for
i
regard
music
as
a
harmless
diversion
and
perfectly
compatible
with
the
profession
of
a
clergyman
when
i
contemplate
the
common
lot
of
mortality
gibbon
writes
i
must
acknowledge
i
have
drawn
a
high
prize
in
the
lottery
of
life
and
he
goes
on
to
count
up
all
his
blessings
with
the
most
offensive
delight
his
wealth
the
good
fortune
of
his
birth
his
ripe
years
a
cheerful
temper
a
moderate
sensibility
health
sound
and
peaceful
slumbers
from

his
valuable
friendship
with
lord
sheffield
his
rank
fame
he
rakes
over
his
whole
life
for
things
to
be
grateful
for
he
intones
his
happiness
in
a
long
recitative
of
thanksgiving
that
his
lot
was
not
that
of
a
savage
of
a
slave
or
a
peasant
he
washes
his
hands
with
imaginary
soap
on
reflecting
on
the
bounty
of
nature
which
cast
his
birth
in
a
free
and
civilised
country
in
an
age
of
science
and
philosophy
in

i
would
love
to
have

out

amused
me
to
discover
the
evident
relish
with
which
the

emphasises
the

something

still
to
call

bloody

is
after
all
only
a
pedantically
exact
description
you
understand
tho
a
very
remarkable
book
a
work
of
genius
to
be
cheerful
this
xmas
would
require
a
de
some
sort
of
psychological
sleight
of
hand
i
get
downstairs
at
and
spend
the
day
reading
and
writing
without
a
soul
to
converse
with
everything
comes
to
me
thro
the
newspapers
the
world
of
life
thro
the
halfpenny
and
the
world
of
books
thro
the
literary
for
the
rest
i
listen
to
the
kettle
singing
and
make
symphonies
out
of
it
or
i
look
into
the
fire
to
see
the
pictures
there
everyone
i
suppose
engaged
in
this
irony
of
xmas
what
a
solemn
lunatic
the
world
is
walked
awhile
in
a
beautiful
lane
close
by
washed
hard
and
clean
and
deeply
channelled
by
the
recent
rain
on
the
i
could
look
right
across
the
valley
to
the
uplands
where
on
the
sky
line
a
few
firs
stood
in
stately
sequestration
from
common
english
oaks
like
a
group
of
ambassadors
in
full
dress
in
the
distance
a
hen
clucked
i
saw
a
few
peewits
wheeling
and
watched
the
smoke
rising
from
our
cottage
perpendicularly
into
the
motionless
air
there
was
a
clement
quiet
and
a
clement
warmth
and
in
my
heart
a
burst
of
real
happiness
that
made
me
rich
even
beside
less
unfortunate
beings
and
beyond
what
i
had
ever
expected
to
be
again
in
thus
describing
and
illustrating
my
intellectual
torpor
i
use
terms
that
apply
more
or
less
to
every
part
of
the
years
during
which
i
was
under
the
circean
spells
of
opium
but
for
misery
why
do
i
waste
my
energy
with
this
damned
journal
i
stop
i
hate
it
i
am
going
out
for
a
walk
in
the
fog
for
the
past
few
days
i
have
been
living
in
a
quiet
hermitage
of
retrospect
my
memories
have
gone
back
to
the
times
remote
inaccessible
prehistoric
before
ever
this
journal
was
begun
when
i
myself
was
but
a
jelly
without
form
and
void
that
is
before
i
had
developed
any
characteristic
qualities
and
above
all
the
dominant
one
a
passion
for
natural
history
one
day
a
school
friend
being
covetous
of
certain
stamps
in
my
collection
induced
me
to
swop
them
for
his
collection
of
birds
eggs
which
he
showed
me
nestling
in
the
bran
at
the
bottom
of
a
box
he
was
a
cunning
boy
and
thought
he
had
the
better
of
the
bargain
he
little
realised
nor
did
i
the
priceless
gift
he
bestowed
when
his
little
fat
dirty
hands
decorated
i
remember
with
innumerable
warts
picked
out
the
eggs
and
gave
them
to
me
in
fact
a
smile
momentarily
crossed
his
face
he
turned
his
head
aside
he
spat
in
happy
contemplation
of
the
deal
i
continued
eagerly
to
add
to
the
little
collection
of
birds
eggs
but
for
a
long
time
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
go
out
into
the
country
myself
and
collect
them
i
just
until
one
day
our
errand
boy
who
stuttered
had
bandy
legs
and
walked
on
the
outside
of
his
feet
with
the
gait
of
an
anthropoid
said
to
me
i
will
you
how
to
find
birds
if
you
like
to
come
out
to
the
so
one
saturday
when
the
backyard
was
cleaned
down
and
the
coal
boxes
filled
he
and
i
started
off
together
to
a
wood
some
way
down
the
river
bank
where
he
my
good
and
beneficent
angel
presently
showed
me
a
nest
in
the
fork
of
a
young
oak
tree
moment
the
sight
of
those
blue
speckled
eggs
lying
so
unexpectedly
as
i
climbed
up
the
tree
on
the
other
side
of
an
untidy
tangle
of
dried
moss
and
grass
in
a
neat
little
earthenware
cup
caused
probably
the
first
tremor
of
real
emotion
at
a
beautiful
object
the
emotion
did
not
last
long
in
a
moment
i
had
stolen
the
eggs
and
soon
after
smashed
them
in
trying
to
blow
them
schoolboy
fashion
then
i
rapidly
became
an
ardent
field
naturalist
my
delight
in
birds
and
birds
eggs
spread
in
a
benignant
infection
to
every
branch
of
natural
history
i
collected
beetles
butterflies
plants
birds
wings
birds
claws
etc
gordon
staples
in
the
own
taught
me
how
to
make
a
skin
and
i
got
hold
of
a
mole
and
then
a
squirrel
the
latter
falling
to
my
prowess
with
a
catapult
stuffed
them
and
set
them
up
in
cases
which
i
glazed
myself
i
even
painted
in
suitable
backgrounds
in
the
one
case
a
looking
i
fear
more
like
a
mountain
and
in
the
other
a
fir
tree
standing
at
an
impossible
angle
of
then
i
read
a
book
on
trapping
and
tried
to
catch
hares
then
i
read
sir
john
lubbock
bees
and
and
constructed
an
observation
ants
nest
though
the
ants
escaped
in
looking
back
to
these
days
i
am
chiefly
struck
by
my
extraordinary
ignorance
of
the
common
objects
of
the
countryside
for
although
we
lived
in
the
far
west
country
the
house
without
a
garden
was
in
the
middle
of
the
town
and
all
my
seniors
were
as
ignorant
as
i
nature
study
in
the
schools
did
not
then
exist
i
had
no
benevolent
paterfamilias
to
take
me
by
the
hand
and
point
out
the
common
british
birds
for
my
father
only
interest
was
in
politics
i
can
remember
coming
home
once
all
agog
with
a
wonderful
bird
i
had
seen
like
a
tiny
magpie
i
said
no
one
could
tell
me
that
it
was
of
course
only
a
little
pied
wagtail
the
absence
of
sympathy
or
of
congenial
companionship
however
had
absolutely
no
effect
in
damping
my
ardour
as
i
grew
older
my
companions
fell
away
some
took
up
the
law
or
tailoring
or
clerking
some
entered
the
church
while
i
became
yearly
more
engrossed
in
my
childhood
my
enthusiasm
lay
like
a
coiled
up
and
hidden
inside
me
until
that
thrush
nest
and
eggs
seized
hold
of
it
by
the
end
and
pulled
it
out
by
degrees
in
a
long
silver
ribbon
i
kept
live
bats
in
our
upstairs
and
newts
and
frogs
in
pans
in
the
backyard
my
mother
tolerated
these
things
because
i
had
sufficiently
impressed
her
with
the
importance
to
science
of
the
observations
which
i
was
making
and
about
to
publish
those
on
bats
indeed
were
thought
fit
to
be
included
in
a
standard
work
of
great
britain
and
the
published
articles
served
to
bring
me
into
correspondence
with
other
naturalists
and
i
shall
never
forget
my
excitement
on
receiving
for
the
first
time
a
letter
of
appreciation
it
was
from
the
author
of
several
natural
history
books
to
barbellion
naturalist
downstable
and
illustrated
with
a
delightful
sketch
of
ring
plovers
feeding
on
the
saltings
this
letter
was
carefully
pasted
into
my
diary
where
it
still
remains
after
all
it
is
perhaps
unfair
to
say
that
i
had
no
kindred
spirit
with
me
in
my
investigations
martha
the
servant
girl
who
had
been
with
us
for
years
loved
animals
of
all
sorts
and
what
was
strange
in
a
country
girl
she
had
no
fear
of
handling
even
such
things
as
newts
and
frogs
my
batrachia
often
used
to
escape
from
their
pans
in
the
yard
into
martha
kitchen
and
not
a
bit
scandalised
she
would
sometimes
catch
one
marching
across
the
rug
or
squeezing
underneath
a
cupboard
lor
would
be
her
comment
as
she
picked
the
vagrant
up
and
took
it
back
to
its
aquarium
ca
travel
martha
had
an
eye
for
character
in
animals
in
the
long
dynasty
of
cats
we
possessed
one
at
length
who
by
association
of
opposite
ideas
we
called
marmaduke
because
he
ought
to
have
been
called
jan
stewer
a
chuff
old
feller
martha
used
to
ask
me
with
pride
and
love
in
her
eyes
he
purrs
in
broad
devon
i
used
to
answer
marmaduke
need
only
wave
the
tip
of
his
tail
to
indicate
to
her
his
imperative
desire
to
promenade
martha
knew
if
no
one
else
did
that
every
spring
pore
underneath
his
fur
used
to
come
out
in
spots
jus
like
a
cheel
gets
a
bit
spotty
as
the
warm
weather
cums
along
starlings
on
the
washhouse
roof
regularly
fed
with
scraps
were
ever
her
wonder
and
delight
don
let
it
down
i
zay
in
later
years
when
i
was
occupied
in
the
top
attic
making
dissections
of
various
animals
that
i
collected
she
would
sometimes
leave
her
scrubbing
and
cleaning
in
the
room
below
to
thrust
her
head
up
the
attic
stairs
and
enquire
be
gettin
on
then
her
unfeigned
interest
in
my
anatomical
researches
gave
me
real
pleasure
and
i
took
delight
in
arousing
her
wonder
by
pointing
out
and
explaining
the
brain
of
a
pigeon
or
the
nervous
system
of
a
or
a
frog
heart
taken
out
and
still
beating
in
the
dissecting
dish
she
in
reply
would
add
reflections
upon
her
own
experiences
in
preparing
meat
for
dinner
anecdotes
about
the
maw
of
an
old
fowl
or
the
great
pipe
of
a
goose
then
suddenly
scurrying
downstairs
she
would
say
i
must
be
off
or
i
shall
be
all
like
the
cow
tail
now
the
dignified
interest
of
the
average
educated
man
would
have
chilled
me
by
the
way
years
later
when
he
was
a
miner
in
wales
that
historic
displayed
his
consciousness
of
the
important
role
he
once
played
by
sending
me
on
a
postcard
congratulations
on
my
success
in
the
appointment
it
touched
me
to
think
he
had
not
forgotten
after
years
of
separation
so
it
proved
see
september
in
la
recherche
de
balzac
see
september
next
entry
and
september
the
handwriting
is
painfully
laboured
very
large
across
a
page
and
so
crooked
as
to
be
almost
undecipherable
in
places
this
is
from
a
letter
written
by
the
dying
keats
in
naples
to
his
friend
brown
contrast
with
it
wordsworth
rotting
at
rydal
mount
or
swinburne
at
putney
the
new
year
came
in
like
a
thief
in
the
night
noiselessly
no
bells
no
syrens
no
songs
by
order
of
the
government
nothing
could
have
been
more
appropriate
than
a
burglarious
entry
like
this
seeing
what
the
year
has
come
to
filch
from
us
all
in
the
next
months
i
am
over
feet
high
and
as
thin
as
a
skeleton
every
bone
in
my
body
even
the
neck
vertebrae
creak
at
odd
intervals
when
i
move
so
that
i
am
not
only
a
skeleton
but
a
badly
articulated
one
to
boot
if
to
this
is
coupled
the
fact
of
the
creeping
paralysis
you
have
the
complete
horror
even
as
i
sit
and
write
millions
of
bacteria
are
gnawing
away
my
precious
spinal
cord
and
if
you
put
your
ear
to
my
back
the
sound
of
the
gnawing
i
dare
say
could
be
heard
the
other
day
a
man
came
and
set
up
a
post
in
the
garden
for
the
clothes
line
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
post
i
said
gibbet
it
looks
exactly
like
one
and
i
for
sure
must
be
the
malefactor
last
night
while
e
was
nursing
the
baby
i
most
delightfully
remarked
what
a
little
parasite
why
you
are
cleopatra
affixing
the
aspic
good
lady
the
bright
day
is
done
and
we
are
for
the
dark
the
fact
that
such
images
arise
spontaneously
in
my
mind
show
how
rotten
to
the
core
i
am
the
advent
of
the
baby
was
my
de
the
little
creature
seems
to
focus
under
one
head
all
my
personal
disasters
and
more
than
once
a
senseless
rage
has
clutched
me
at
the
thought
of
a
baby
in
exchange
for
my
ambition
a
nursery
for
the
study
yet
on
the
whole
i
find
it
a
good
and
satisfying
thing
to
see
her
healthy
new
intact
on
the
threshold
i
grow
tired
of
my
own
dismal
life
just
as
one
does
of
a
suit
of
dirty
clothes
my
life
and
person
are
patched
and
greasy
hers
is
new
and
without
a
single
blemish
or
misfortune
moreover
she
makes
her
mother
happy
and
consoles
her
grandmother
too
what
a
delightful
thing
the
state
of
death
would
be
if
the
dead
passed
their
time
haunting
the
places
they
loved
in
life
and
living
over
again
the
dear
delightful
past
if
death
were
one
long
indulgence
in
the
pleasures
of
memory
if
the
disembodied
spirit
forgot
all
the
pains
of
its
previous
existence
and
remembered
only
the
happiness
think
of
me
flitting
about
the
orchards
and
in
birdsnesting
walking
along
the
coast
among
the
seabirds
climbing
exmoor
bathing
in
streams
and
in
the
sea
haunting
all
my
old
loves
and
passions
cutting
open
with
devouring
curiosity
rabbits
pigeons
frogs
dogfish
amphioxus
think
of
me
too
at
length
unwillingly
deflected
from
these
cherished
pursuits
in
the
raptures
of
first
love
cutting
her
initials
on
trees
and
fences
instead
of
watching
birds
over
and
and
then
bitterly
reproaching
myself
later
for
much
loss
of
precious
time
how
happy
i
shall
be
if
death
is
like
this
to
be
living
over
again
and
again
all
my
ecstasies
over
first
times
the
first
time
i
found
a
bottle
tit
nest
the
first
time
i
succeeded
in
penetrating
into
the
fastnesses
of
my
el
dorado
exmoor
the
first
time
i
gazed
upon
the
internal
anatomy
of
a
snail
the
first
time
i
read
of
human
what
a
epoch
that
was
and
the
first
time
i
kissed
her
my
hope
is
that
i
may
haunt
these
times
again
that
i
may
haunt
the
places
the
books
the
bathes
the
walks
the
desires
the
hopes
the
first
and
last
loves
of
my
life
all
transfigured
and
beatified
by
sovereign
memory
out
of
doors
it
like
the
roaring
forties
every
tree
i
passed
in
the
lane
was
a
great
wind
instrument
bellowing
out
a
passionate
song
and
the
sky
was
torn
to
ribbons
it
is
cold
enough
to
freeze
the
nose
off
a
brass
monkey
but
very
exhilarating
i
stood
on
the
hill
and
squared
my
fists
to
the
wind
and
bade
everything
come
on
i
sit
writing
this
by
the
fire
and
am
thoroughly
scourged
and
purified
by
this
great
castigating
wind
i
think
i
will
stick
it
out
i
will
sit
quite
still
in
my
chair
and
defy
this
sculking
footpad
let
the
paralysis
creep
into
every
bone
i
will
hang
on
to
the
last
and
watch
it
skulking
with
my
most
hideous
grimace
still
freezing
and
blowing
coming
back
from
the
village
tho
i
was
tired
and
hobbling
badly
decided
to
walk
up
the
lane
even
if
it
meant
crawling
home
on
hands
and
knees
the
sky
was
a
artist
every
time
you
looked
you
saw
a
different
picture
from
the
bottom
of
the
hill
i
looked
up
and
saw
above
me
it
seemed
at
an
immense
and
windy
height
a
piece
of
blue
framed
in
an
irregular
edge
of
white
woolly
cloud
seen
thro
the
crooked
branches
of
an
oak
it
was
a
narrow
crooked
lane
sunk
deep
in
the
soil
with
large
smooth
surfaces
of
stone
like
skulls
bulging
up
in
places
where
the
rain
had
washed
away
the
soil
further
on
the
sun
was
lying
low
almost
in
the
centre
of
a
bend
in
the
near
horizon
it
frosted
the
wool
of
a
few
sheep
seen
in
silhouette
and
then
slowly
disappeared
in
mist
on
the
side
was
a
cottage
with
the
smoke
being
wrenched
away
from
the
chimney
top
and
on
the
left
a
group
of
stately
firs
chanting
a
requiem
like
a
cathedral
choir
still
blowing
and
bitterly
cold
along
the
path
fields
in
the
park
i
stopped
to
look
at
a
thick
clump
of
firs
standing
aloof
on
some
high
ground
and
guarded
by
an
outside
ring
of
honest
english
oaks
ashes
and
elms
they
were
a
sombre
mysterious
little
crowd
intent
i
fancied
on
some
secret
ritual
of
the
trees
the
high
ground
on
which
they
stood
looked
higher
and
more
inaccessible
than
it
really
was
the
clump
was
dark
green
almost
black
and
in
between
their
trunks
where
all
was
obscurity
some
hardy
adventurer
might
well
have
discovered
a
grand
lama
sitting
within
his
penetralia
but
i
had
no
taste
for
any
such
profanity
and
even
as
i
looked
the
sun
came
out
from
behind
a
cloud
very
slowly
bringing
the
picture
into
clearer
focus
chasing
away
shadows
and
bringing
out
all
the
colours
the
landscape
resumed
its
homely
aspect
an
english
park
with
firs
in
it
last
night
i
pulled
aside
the
window
curtain
of
our
front
door
and
peeped
out
just
below
the
densely
black
projecting
gable
of
the
house
i
saw
the
crescent
moon
lying
on
her
back
in
a
bed
of
purple
sky
and
i
saw
our
little
white
frosted
garden
path
curving
up
towards
the
garden
gate
it
was
a
delicious
and
i
shewed
it
to
e
showers
of
snow
at
intervals
the
little
flakes
rocking
about
lazily
or
spiralling
down
while
the
few
that
eventually
reached
the
ground
would
in
a
moment
or
so
be
caught
up
in
a
sudden
furious
puff
of
wind
and
sent
driving
along
the
road
with
the
dust
my
usual
little
jaunt
up
the
lane
past
the
mossy
home
to
toasted
and
a
pinewood
fire
with
my
wife
chattering
prettily
to
the
baby
after
tea
enchanted
by
the
reading
of
a
new
book
journal
de
maurice
de
or
rather
the
introduction
to
it
by
i
devoured
it
i
have
spent
a
devouring
day
under
a
calm
exterior
i
have
burnt
up
the
hours
all
of
me
has
been
athrob
every
little
cell
in
my
brain
has
danced
to
its
own
little
tune
for
death
has
been
an
impossibility
i
have
felt
that
anyhow
i
could
not
die
i
have
laughed
at
the
mere
thought
of
it
if
only
this
mood
would
last
if
i
could
feel
thus
always
then
i
could
fend
off
death
for
an
immortality
of
life
but
suddenly
as
now
the
real
horror
of
my
life
and
future
comes
on
me
in
a
flash
for
a
second
i
am
terrified
by
the
menace
of
the
future
but
fortunately
only
for
a
second
for
i
learnt
a
trick
which
i
fear
to
reveal
it
is
so
valuable
and
necessary
to
me
that
if
i
talked
of
it
or
vulgarised
it
my
secret
might
be
stolen
away
not
a
word
then
i
have
just
heard
on
the
gramophone
some
grieg
and
it
has
charged
my
happiness
with
disrupting
voltage
of
desire
oh
if
only
i
had
health
i
could
make
the
welkin
ring
i
shall
leave
so
little
behind
me
such
a
few
paltry
pages
beside
what
i
have
it
in
me
to
do
it
shatters
me
looking
back
i
must
say
i
like
the
splendid
gusto
with
which
i
lived
thro
yesterday
that
mettlesome
fashion
in
which
i
took
the
lane
and
at
the
top
how
i
swung
around
to
sweep
my
gaze
across
to
the
uplands
opposite
with
snow
falling
all
the
time
then
in
the
evening
the
almost
complete
absorption
in
the
new
book
when
i
forgot
everything
it
was
quite
like
the
old
days
after
four
months
sick
leave
returned
to
work
and
london
an
illness
like
mine
rejuvenates
one
for
the
time
being
a
pony
and
jingle
from
the
old
fox
and
hounds
inn
took
me
to
the
station
and
i
enjoyed
the
feel
of
the
wheels
rolling
beneath
me
over
the
hard
road
in
the
train
i
looked
out
of
the
window
as
interested
as
any
schoolboy
on
the
underground
i
was
delighted
with
the
smooth
quiet
way
with
which
the
metro
trains
glide
into
the
station
i
had
quite
forgotten
this
then
when
my
hand
began
to
get
better
i
rediscovered
the
pleasures
of
penmanship
and
kept
on
writing
with
my
tongue
out
and
i
the
child
satisfaction
in
coaxing
a
button
to
slip
into
its
hole
all
people
have
forgotten
how
difficult
and
complex
such
operations
are
this
morning
how
desirable
everything
seemed
to
me
the
world
intoxicated
me
moving
again
among
so
many
human
beings
gave
me
the
and
started
again
all
the
pangs
of
the
old
familiar
hunger
for
a
fuller
life
that
centrifugal
elan
in
which
i
feared
for
the
disruption
and
scattering
of
my
parts
in
all
directions
temporarily
i
lost
the
hegemony
of
my
own
soul
every
man
and
woman
i
met
was
my
enemy
threatening
me
with
the
secession
of
some
inward
part
i
was
alarmed
to
discover
how
many
women
i
could
passionately
love
and
with
how
many
men
i
could
form
a
lasting
friendship
within
all
was
anarchy
and
commotion
a
cold
fright
seized
me
lest
some
extraordinary
event
was
about
to
happen
some
general
histolysis
of
my
body
some
sudden
disintegration
of
my
personality
some
madness
some
strange
death
i
wanted
to
crush
out
the
life
of
all
these
men
and
women
in
a
great
bear
hug
my
god
this
sea
of
human
faces
whom
i
can
never
recognise
all
of
us
alive
together
beneath
this
yellow
catafalque
of
fog
on
the
morning
of
the
announcement
of
world
famine
and
world
war
i
have
lost
this
paroxysm
for
i
am
home
again
by
the
fireside
all
the
multitude
have
disappeared
from
my
view
i
have
lost
them
every
one
i
have
lost
another
day
of
my
life
and
so
have
they
and
we
have
lost
each
other
meanwhile
the
great
world
spins
on
unrelentingly
frittering
away
lightly
my
precious
hours
surely
a
small
stock
now
while
i
sit
discomfited
by
the
evening
fire
and
nurse
my
scraped
hands
that
tingle
because
the
spinning
world
has
wrenched
itself
out
of
my
feeble
grasp
this
morning
on
arriving
at
kensington
went
straight
to
a
shop
but
finding
someone
inside
i
drew
back
and
went
on
to
another
have
you
any
morphia
tabloids
i
asked
a
smiling
youth
who
leaned
with
both
hands
on
the
counter
and
looked
at
me
knowingly
as
if
he
had
had
unlimited
experience
of
morphi
nomaniacs
yes
plenty
of
them
he
said
fencing
and
then
waited
can
you
supply
me
i
asked
feeling
very
conscious
of
myself
he
smiled
once
more
shook
his
head
and
said
it
was
contrary
to
the
defence
of
the
realm
act
i
made
a
sorry
effort
to
appear
ingenuous
and
he
said
of
course
it
is
only
a
palliative
with
a
solemn
countenance
intended
to
indicate
pain
i
answered
yes
but
palliatives
are
very
necessary
sometimes
and
i
walked
out
of
the
hateful
shop
discomfited
am
busy
editing
and
bowdlerising
my
journals
for
publication
against
the
time
when
i
shall
have
gone
the
way
of
all
flesh
no
one
else
would
prepare
it
for
publication
if
i
do
reading
it
through
again
i
see
what
a
remarkable
book
i
have
written
if
only
they
will
publish
it
the
other
morning
as
i
dressed
i
could
see
the
sun
like
a
large
yellow
moon
rising
on
a
world
stiff
stark
its
contours
merely
indicated
beneath
a
of
snow
further
around
the
horizon
was
another
moon
the
full
moon
itself
yellow
likewise
but
setting
it
was
the
strangest
picture
i
ever
saw
i
might
well
have
been
upon
another
planet
i
could
not
have
been
more
surprised
even
at
a
whole
ring
of
yellow
satellites
arranged
at
regular
intervals
all
around
the
horizon
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
i
drove
home
from
the
station
in
a
little
over
a
road
the
cautious
little
pony
picked
out
her
way
so
carefully
in
little
strides
wherever
it
was
slippery
and
the
landlord
of
the
inn
sat
opposite
me
extolling
all
the
clever
little
creature
merits
it
was
dusk
and
for
some
reason
of
the
atmosphere
the
scraps
of
cloud
appeared
as
blue
sky
and
the
blue
sky
as
cloud
beneath
which
the
full
moon
like
a
great
chinese
lantern
hung
suspended
so
low
down
it
seemed
to
touch
the
trees
and
hills
how
have
folk
been
able
to
carry
on
in
a
world
so
utterly
strange
as
this
one
during
the
past
few
days
i
marvel
that
beneath
such
moons
and
suns
the
peoples
of
the
world
have
not
ceased
for
a
while
from
the
petty
business
of
war
during
at
least
a
few
of
our
dancing
revolutions
around
this
furnace
of
a
star
one
of
these
days
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
this
fascinated
earth
did
not
fall
into
it
like
a
moth
into
a
candle
and
where
would
our
great
war
be
then
strangeness
of
my
consider
the
war
and
the
current
adventures
of
millions
of
men
on
land
sea
and
air
and
the
incessant
labours
of
millions
of
men
in
factory
and
workshop
and
in
the
field
think
of
the
hospitals
and
all
they
hold
of
everyone
hoping
fearing
suffering
waiting
of
the
concentration
of
all
humanity
on
the
one
subject
the
war
and
then
think
of
me
poor
little
me
deserted
and
forgotten
a
tiny
fragment
sunk
so
deep
and
helplessly
between
the
sheer
granite
walls
of
my
environment
that
scarce
an
echo
reaches
me
of
the
thunder
among
the
mountains
above
i
read
about
the
war
in
a
paper
and
see
it
in
the
pictures
of
the
for
the
rest
i
live
by
counting
the
joints
on
legs
and
even
that
much
effort
is
almost
beyond
my
strength
that
is
strange
enough
but
my
life
is
stranger
still
by
comparison
and
this
is
the
marvel
that
every
day
i
spend
by
the
waters
of
babylon
weeping
and
neglected
among
enthusiasts
enthusiastically
counting
joints
while
every
evening
i
return
to
zion
to
my
books
to
poems
to
maurice
de
guérin
journals
to
my
own
memoirs
mine
is
a
life
of
consummate
isolation
and
i
frequently
marvel
at
it
the
men
i
meet
accept
me
as
an
entomologist
and
an
enthusiast
in
the
science
that
is
all
they
know
of
me
and
all
they
want
to
know
of
me
or
of
any
man
surely
no
man
existence
was
ever
quite
such
a
duplicity
as
mine
i
smile
bitterly
to
myself
ten
times
a
day
as
i
engage
in
all
the
dreary
technical
jargon
of
professional
talk
with
them
how
they
would
gossip
over
the
facts
of
my
life
if
they
knew
how
scandalised
they
would
be
over
my
inner
life
activities
how
resentful
of
enthusiasm
other
than
entomological
i
find
it
very
irksome
to
keep
up
this
farce
of
concealment
i
would
love
to
declare
myself
i
loathe
hate
and
detest
the
secrecy
of
my
real
self
the
continuous
restraint
enforced
on
me
ulcerates
my
heart
and
makes
harmonious
social
existence
impossible
with
those
who
do
not
know
me
thoroughly

it
is
curious
for
me
to
look
at
my
tubes
and
microscope
and
realise
that
i
shall
never
require
them
again
for
serious
use
life
is
a
dreadful
burden
to
me
at
the
museum
i
am
too
ill
for
any
scientific
work
so
i
write
labels
and
put
things
away
i
am
simply
marking
time
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
awaiting
the
order
forward
it
is
excoriating
to
be
thus
wasting
the
last
few
precious
days
of
my
life
in
such
mummery
merely
to
get
bread
to
eat
they
might
at
least
let
me
die
in
peace
and
with
fitting
decorum
it
is
so
ignoble
to
be
tinkering
about
in
a
museum
among
scarabees
and
insects
when
i
ought
to
be
reflecting
on
life
and
death
i
ask
myself
what
ought
to
be
my
most
appropriate
reaction
in
such
circumstances
as
the
present
why
of
course
to
carry
on
as
if
all
were
normal
and
the
future
unknown
why
so
i
do
to
outward
view
for
the
sake
of
the
others
yet
that
is
no
reason
why
in
my
own
inward
parts
i
should
not
at
times
indulge
in
a
little
relaxation
it
is
a
relief
to
put
off
the
mailed
coat
to
sit
awhile
by
the
fire
and
have
life
as
it
really
is
all
to
myself
but
the
necessity
of
living
will
not
let
me
alone
i
must
be
always
mumming
my
life
has
been
all
isolation
and
restriction
and
it
now
appears
even
my
death
is
to
be
hedged
around
with
prohibitions
drugs
for
example
how
beneficent
a
little
laudanum
at
times
in
a
case
like
mine
and
how
happy
i
could
be
if
i
knew
that
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
i
carried
a
kindly
easy
means
of
shuffling
off
this
coil
when
the
time
comes
as
come
it
must
it
horrifies
me
to
consider
how
i
might
break
the
life
of
e
clean
in
two
and
sap
her
courage
by
a
lingering
dawdling
dying
but
there
is
the
defence
of
the
realm
act
it
is
a
case
of
a
scorpion
in
a
ring
of
fire
but
without
any
sting
in
its
tail
i
ask
myself
what
are
my
views
on
death
the
next
world
god
i
look
into
my
mind
and
discover
i
am
too
much
of
a
mannikin
to
have
any
as
for
death
i
am
a
little
bit
of
trembling
jelly
of
anticipation
i
am
prepared
for
anything
but
i
am
the
complete
agnostic
i
simply
know
to
have
views
faith
beliefs
one
needs
a
backbone
this
great
bully
of
a
universe
overwhelms
me
the
stars
make
me
cower
i
am
intimidated
by
the
immensity
surrounding
my
own
littleness
it
is
futile
and
presumptuous
for
me
to
opine
anything
about
the
next
world
but
i
for
something
much
freer
and
more
satisfying
after
death
for
emancipation
of
the
spirit
and
above
all
for
the
obliteration
of
this
puny
self
this
little
skulking
ferret
potted
he
was
an
imaginative
youth
and
she
a
tragedy
queen
so
he
fell
in
love
with
her
because
she
was
melancholy
and
her
past
tragic
she
is
of
tragedy
too
he
said
which
was
a
high
encomium
but
he
was
also
an
ambitious
youth
and
all
for
dalliance
in
love
marriage
said
he
sententiously
is
an
economic
trap
and
then
a
little
wistfully
if
she
were
a
bit
more
melancholy
and
a
bit
more
beautiful
she
would
be
quite
irresistible
but
he
was
a
miserable
youth
too
and
in
the
anguish
of
loneliness
and
lovelessness
a
home
tempted
him
sorely
still
he
dallied
waited
after
all
made
marriage
impossible
yet
love
and
misery
drove
him
towards
it
so
one
day
he
closed
his
eyes
and
offered
himself
up
with
sacrificial
hands
too
late
she
said
once
perhaps
but
now
his
eyes
opened
again
and
in
a
second
love
entered
his
temple
once
more
and
finally
ejected
the
money
changers
so
they
married
after
all
and
he
was
under
the
impression
she
had
made
a
good
match
he
had
perhaps
yet
who
could
doubt
his
ultimate
fame
then
the
war
came
and
he
had
the
hardihood
to
open
a
sealed
letter
from
his
doctor
to
the
examining
recruits
stars
and
staggers
so
it
was
she
who
was
the
victim
in
marriage
that
harassing
question
did
she
know
what
an
ass
he
had
been
all
through
what
superlative
egoism
and
superlative
conceit
then
a
baby
came
he
broke
under
the
strain
and
daily
the
symptoms
grew
more
obvious
did
she
know
the
question
dazed
him
well
she
know
and
had
married
him
for
love
nevertheless
against
every
friendly
counsel
the
doctor
included
and
now
the
invalid
gratitude
is
almost
cringeing
his
admiration
boundless
and
his
love
for
always
it
is
the
perfect
between
two
souls
one
that
was
honeycombed
with
and
lost
in
the
labyrinthine
ways
of
his
own
motives
and
the
other
straight
direct
almost
imperious
in
love
and
altogether
adorable
at
home
ill
again
yesterday
was
a
day
of
utter
dreariness
all
my
nerves
were
frozen
my
heart
congealed
i
had
no
love
for
anyone
no
emotion
of
any
sort
it
was
a
catalepsy
of
the
spirit
harder
to
bear
than
fever
or
pain
life
is
once
more
stirring
in
me
i
am
slowly
awaking
to
the
consciousness
of
acute
but
almost
welcome
misery
an
affectionate
letter
from
h
that
warmed
the
cockles
of
my
heart
poor
frozen
molluscs
a
has
written
only
once
since
august
i
am
i
suppose
a
creature
yet
even
an
infantry
subaltern
has
a
chance
my
dear
friend
has
died
and
a
exhibition
of
his
pictures
is
being
held
at
the
goupil
gallery
the
most
fascinating
man
i
ever
met
i
was
attracted
by
him
almost
as
one
is
attracted
by
a
charming
woman
by
little
ways
by
laughing
eyes
by
the
manner
of
speech
and
now
he
is
dead
of
a
lingering
and
painful
disease
have
been
reading
sir
oliver
lodge
i
do
not
deny
that
i
am
curious
about
the
next
world
or
about
the
condition
of
death
i
am
and
always
have
been
in
my
early
youth
i
reflected
continually
on
death
and
hated
it
bitterly
but
now
that
my
end
is
near
and
certain
i
consider
it
less
and
am
content
to
wait
and
see
as
for
all
practical
purposes
i
have
done
with
life
and
my
own
existence
is
often
a
burden
to
me
and
is
like
to
become
a
burden
also
to
others
i
wish
i
possessed
the
wherewithal
to
end
it
at
my
will
with
two
or
three
tabloids
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
and
my
secret
locked
in
my
heart
how
serenely
i
would
move
about
among
my
friends
and
fellows
conscious
that
at
some
specially
selected
moment
at
midnight
or
high
noon
just
when
the
spirit
moved
me
i
could
quietly
slip
out
to
sea
on
this
great
adventure
it
would
be
well
to
be
able
to
control
this
the
time
the
place
and
the
manner
of
one
exit
for
what
disturbs
me
in
particular
is
how
i
shall
conduct
myself
i
am
afraid
lest
i
become
afraid
it
is
a
fear
of
fear
by
means
of
my
tabloids
i
could
arrange
my
death
in
an
artistic
setting
say
underneath
a
big
tree
on
a
summer
day
with
an
open
homer
in
my
hand
or
more
appropriately
a
magnifying
glass
and
miall
and
denny
it
would
be
my
own
demise
and
surely
the
last
thing
in
elegance
i
think
it
was
de
ouincey
who
said
death
to
him
seemed
most
awful
in
the
summer
on
the
contrary
the
earth
is
warm
then
and
would
welcome
my
old
bones
it
is
on
a
cold
night
by
the
winter
fire
that
the
churchyard
seems
to
me
the
least
inviting
especially
horrible
it
is
the
first
evening
after
the
funeral
have
had
a
relapse
my
hand
i
fear
is
going
food
prices
are
leaping
up
woe
to
the
unfit
and
the
old
and
the
poor
in
these
coming
days
we
shall
soon
have
nothing
left
in
our
pantries
and
a
piece
of
wrigley
chewing
gum
will
be
our
only
comfort
when
i
come
to
quit
this
world
i
scarcely
know
which
will
be
the
greater
regret
the
people
i
have
never
met
or
the
places
i
have
never
seen
in
the
world
of
books
i
rest
fairly
content
i
have
read
my
fair
share
i
read
down
the
column
of
preachers
with
the
most
ludicrous
avidity
ticking
off
the
churches
i
have
visited
and
the
abbey
the
ethical
church
in
bayswater
and
westminster
cathedral
but
the
unitarians
the
christadelphians
the
theosophists
the
church
of
christ
scientist
the
buddhist
society
the
brompton
oratory
the
church
of
humanity
the
new
life
centre
all
these
adventures
i
intended
one
day
to
make
it
is
not
much
fun
ticking
off
things
you
have
done
from
a
list
if
you
have
done
very
little
i
get
more
satisfaction
out
of
a
list
of
books
but
iona
and
the
hebrides
edinburgh
brussels
buenos
ayres
spitzbergen
when
the
flowers
are
out
the
niagara
falls
by
moonlight
the
grindelwald
cairo
these
names
make
me
growl
and
occasionally
yelp
like
a
hurt
puppy
although
to
outward
view
i
am
sitting
in
an
armchair
blowing
graph
of
in
this
journal
my
pen
is
a
delicate
needle
point
tracing
out
a
graph
of
temperament
so
as
to
show
its
daily
fluctuations
grave
and
gay
up
and
down
lamentation
and
revelry
and
you
get
here
all
my
thoughts
and
opinions
always
irresponsible
and
often
contradictory
or
mutually
exclusive
all
my
moods
and
vapours
all
the
varying
reactions
to
environment
of
this
jelly
which
is
i
snap
at
any
idea
that
comes
floating
down
particularly
if
it
is
gaudy
or
quixotic
no
matter
if
it
is
wholly
incompatible
with
what
i
said
the
day
before
people
unpleasantly
refer
me
back
and
to
escape
i
have
to
invent
some
sophistry
i
unconsciously
imitate
the
mannerisms
of
folk
i
am
particularly
taken
with
other
people
never
fail
to
tell
me
of
my
simulations
if
i
read
a
book
and
like
it
very
much
by
a
process
of
peaceful
penetration
the
author
takes
possession
of
my
whole
personality
just
as
if
i
were
a
medium
giving
a
sitting
and
for
some
time
subsequently
his
ideas
come
spurting
up
like
a
fountain
making
a
pretty
display
which
i
take
to
be
my
own
other
people
say
of
me
oh
i
expect
he
read
it
in
a
book
i
am
something
between
a
monkey
a
chameleon
and
a
jellyfish
to
any
bully
with
an
intellect
like
a
blunderbuss
i
have
always
timidly
held
up
my
hands
and
afterwards
gnashed
my
teeth
for
my
cowardice
in
conversation
with
men
of
alien
sentiment
i
am
to
my
intense
chagrin
often
from
mere
shyness
i
say
yes
yes
yes
to
nausea
when
it
ought
to
be
no
no
no
i
become
my
own
renegade
an
amiable
dissembler
an
ass
in
short
it
is
a
torture
to
have
a
sprightly
mind
blanketed
by
personal
timidity
and
a
feeble
presence
the
humiliating
thing
is
that
almost
any
strong
character
hynotises
me
into
complacency
especially
if
he
is
a
stranger
i
find
myself
for
the
time
being
in
really
sincere
agreement
with
him
and
only
later
discover
to
myself
his
abominable
doctrines
then
i
lie
in
bed
and
have
imaginary
conversations
in
which
i
get
my
own
back
but
by
jove
i
wreak
vengeance
on
my
familiars
and
on
those
brethren
even
weaker
than
myself
they
get
my
concentrated
gall
my
sulphurous
fulminations
and
would
wonder
to
read
this
confession
for
an
unusually
long
time
after
i
grew
up
i
maintained
a
beautiful
confidence
in
the
goodness
of
mankind
rumours
did
reach
me
but
i
brushed
them
aside
as
slanders
i
was
an
ingénu
unsuspecting
credulous
i
thoroughly
believed
that
men
and
women
and
i
were
much
better
than
we
actually
are
i
have
not
come
to
the
end
of
my
disillusions
even
now
i
still
rub
my
eyes
on
occasion
i
simply
believe
that
we
are
such
humbugs
hypocrites
and
strange
to
say
it
is
the
good
people
above
all
who
most
bitterly
disappoint
me
give
me
a
healthy
liar
or
a
thief
or
a
vagabond
and
he
arouses
no
expectations
and
so
i
get
no
it
is
the
good
the
honest
the
true
who
cheat
me
of
my
boyhood
beliefs
i
am
a
cynic
then
but
not
a
reckless
cynic
a
careworn
unhappy
cynic
without
the
cynic
pride
it
is
easy
to
be
cynical
someone
admonished
me
unfortunately
it
is
i
said
we
are
so
cold
so
aloof
so
even
the
warmest
friends
men
of
piety
love
god
but
their
love
for
each
other
is
so
commonly
but
a
poor
thing
my
own
affections
are
always
frosted
over
with
the
englishman
reserve
i
hesitate
as
if
i
were
not
sure
of
them
i
am
afraid
of
i
hate
to
find
out
either
myself
or
others
and
yet
i
am
always
doing
so
mine
is
a
restlessly
analytical
brain
i
dissect
everyone
even
those
i
love
and
my
discoveries
frequently
sting
me
to
the
quick
to
the
pure
all
things
are
pure
whence
i
should
conclude
i
suppose
that
it
is
the
beam
in
my
own
eye
but
i
would
not
tolerate
being
deceived
concerning
either
my
own
beam
or
other
motes
and
yesterday
i
collected
two
distinct
and
several
twinges
and
hereby
save
them
up
they
were
more
than
that
they
were
pangs
and
pangs
that
twanged
why
do
i
make
fun
of
my
suffering
one
was
when
i
saw
the
figure
of
the
remains
in
the
slab
of
lithographic
sandstone
of
bavaria
a
reproduction
in
an
illustrated
encyclopædia
the
other
was
when
someone
mentioned
mud
and
i
thought
of
the
wide
estuary
of
the
t
its
stretches
of
mudflats
and
its
we
were
turning
over
some
pages
and
she
said
what
that
said
i
whatever
is
an
extinct
bird
i
answered
mournfully
like
an
old
amour
my
love
of
palæontology
and
anatomy
and
all
the
high
hopes
i
entertained
of
them
came
smarting
to
life
again
so
i
turned
over
the
page
quickly
but
why
need
i
explain
to
you
o
my
journal
to
others
i
could
not
explain
i
was
i
used
to
get
very
muddy
i
remarked
lamentably
in
the
old
days
when
stalking
birds
on
the
mudflats
and
they
rather
jeered
at
such
an
occupation
in
such
a
place
just
as
those
beautiful
sights
and
sounds
of
twinkling
runnels
swiftly
running
waders
their
whistles
and
cries
began
to
steal
over
my
memory
like
a
delicate
pain
to
my
infinite
regret
i
have
no
description
no
photograph
or
sketch
no
token
of
any
sort
to
remember
them
by
and
their
doom
is
certain
heavens
how
i
wasted
my
impressions
and
experiences
then
swinburne
has
some
lines
about
saltings
which
console
me
a
little
but
i
know
of
no
other
descriptions
by
either
pen
or
brush
how
revolting
it
is
to
see
some
barren
old
woman
over
a
baby
bestowing
voluptuous
kisses
on
its
nose
eyes
hands
feet
utterly
intoxicated
and
chattering
incessantly
in
the
little
language
and
hopping
about
like
an
infatuated
cock
grouse
the
nurse
has
been
here
now
for
over
five
weeks
one
day
has
been
pretty
much
the
same
as
another
i
get
out
of
bed
usually
about
and
sit
by
the
window
and
churn
over
past
present
and
future
however
the
swallows
have
arrived
at
last
though
they
were
very
late
and
there
are
also
cuckoos
green
moorhens
calling
from
across
the
park
at
night
when
the
moon
is
up
i
get
a
great
deal
of
fun
out
of
an
extremely
brown
owl
who
hoots
up
through
the
breadth
and
length
of
the
valley
and
then
i
am
sure
listens
with
satisfaction
to
his
echo
still
i
have
much
sympathy
with
that
brown
owl
and
his
hooting
what
i
do
goodness
knows
what
e
does
is
to
drug
my
mind
with
print
i
am
just
a
of
smollett
wells
samuel

except
for
an
occasional
geyser
of
malediction
when
some
particularly
acrid
memory
comes
uppermost
in
my
mind
i
find
myself
submitting
with
a
surprising
calm
and
even
cheerfulness
that
agony
of
frustration
which
gnawed
my
vitals
so
much
in
has
disappeared
and
i
who
expected
to
go
down
in
the
smoke
and
sulphur
of
my
own
fulminations
am
quite
as
likely
to
fold
my
hands
across
my
chest
with
a
truly
christian
resignation
joubert
said
patience
and
misfortune
courage
and
death
resignation
and
the
inevitable
generally
come
together
indifference
to
life
generally
arises
with
the
impossibility
of
preserving
it
how
cynical
that
sounds
this
and
another
volume
of
my
journal
are
temporarily
lodged
in
a
drawer
in
my
bedroom
it
appears
to
me
that
as
i
become
more
static
and
moribund
they
become
more
active
and
aggressive
all
day
they
make
a
perfect
uproar
in
their
solitary
confinement
although
no
one
hears
it
and
at
night
they
become
phosphorescent
though
nobody
sees
it
one
of
these
days
with
continued
neglect
they
will
blow
up
from
spontaneous
combustion
like
diseased
gunpowder
the
dismembered
diarist
being
thus
hoist
upon
his
own
petard
we
discuss
post
mortem
affairs
quite
genially
and
without
restraint
it
is
the
contempt
bred
of
familiarity
i
suppose
e
says
widows
weeds
have
been
so
vulgarised
by
the
war
widows
that
she
wo
go
into
deep
mourning
but
you
wear
just
one
weed
or
two
for
me
i
plead
and
then
we
laugh
she
has
promised
me
that
should
a
suitable
chance
arise
she
will
marry
again
personally
i
wish
i
could
place
my
hand
on
the
young
fellow
at
once
so
as
to
put
him
thro
his
paces
shew
him
where
the
water
main
runs
and
where
the
gas
meter
is
and
so
on
you
will
observe
what
a
relish
i
have
for
my
own
and
how
keenly
i
appreciate
the
present
situation
nobody
can
say
i
am
not
making
the
best
of
it
one
might
call
it
pulling
the
hangman
beard
yet
i
ought
i
fancy
to
be
bewailing
my
poor
wife
and
fatherless
child
i
sit
all
day
in
my
chair
moving
feet
to
my
bed
at
night
and
feet
from
it
to
my
chair
in
the
morning
and
wait
the
assignation
is
certain
life
is
a
coquetry
with
death
that
wearies
me
too
sure
of
the
amour
it
is
odd
that
at
this
time
of
the
breaking
of
nations
destiny
with
her
hands
so
full
should
spare
the
time
to
pursue
a
atom
like
me
down
such
a
labyrinthine
it
is
odd
to
find
her
determined
to
destroy
me
with
such
tremendous
thoroughness
one
would
have
thought
it
sufficient
merely
to
brush
the
dust
off
my
wings
why
this
deliberate
malignity
perhaps
it
is
a
punishment
for
the
impudence
of
my
desires
i
wanted
everything
so
i
get
nothing
i
gave
nothing
so
i
receive
nothing
i
am
not
offering
up
my
life
willingly
it
is
being
taken
from
me
piece
by
piece
while
i
watch
the
pilfering
with
lamentable
eyes
i
have
tendered
my
resignation
and
retire
on
a
small
gratuity
my
hand
gets
a
little
better
but
it
a
cat
and
mouse
game
and
so
humiliating
to
be
the
mouse
parental
affection
comes
to
me
only
in
spasms
and
if
they
hurt
they
do
not
last
long
curiously
enough
as
in
the
case
of
very
old
people
my
consciousness
reverts
more
easily
to
conditions
long
past
i
seem
unable
to
apprehend
all
the
significance
of
having
a
old
daughter
but
some
bullfinches
or
swallows
seen
thro
the
window
rouse
me
more
no
one
can
deny
i
have
loved
birds
to
intoxication
in
my
youth
birds
eggs
and
little
nestlings
and
chickens
sent
me
into
such
raptures
i
could
never
tell
it
to
you
adequately
i
am
too
tired
to
write
more
reading
pascal
again
if
shelley
was
gold
dusty
from
tumbling
among
the
stars
pascal
was
bruised
and
shaken
the
one
was
delighted
and
the
other
frightened
i
like
pascal
prostration
before
the
infinities
of
time
space
and
the
unknown
somehow
he
conveys
this
more
vividly
than
the
uplift
afforded
him
by
religion
i
do
believe
in
the
theory
of
marriage
there
are
plenty
of
men
any
one
of
whom
she
might
have
married
and
lived
with
happily
and
simpler
men
than
i
am
methinks
there
are
large
tracts
could
be
sliced
off
my
character
and
she
would
scarcely
feel
the
want
of
them
to
think
that
she
of
all
women
with
a
past
such
as
hers
should
be
swept
into
my
vicious
orbit
yet
she
seems
to
bear
destiny
no
resentment
so
i
bear
it
for
her
and
enough
for
two
at
our
engagement
i
gave
her
my
own
ring
to
wear
as
a
pledge
we
thought
it
nicer
than
buying
a
new
one
it
was
a
signet
ring
with
a
dark
smooth
stone
strange
to
say
it
never
once
occurred
to
me
till
now
that
it
was
a
mourning
ring
in
memory
of
a
of
mine
actually
with
an
inscription
on
the
inside
as
long
as
i
can
hold
a
pen
i
shall
i
suppose
go
on
trickling
ink
into
this
diary
i
am
amusing
myself
by
reading
the
in
volumes
i
turn
over
the
pages
and
read
everything
of
interest
that
catches
my
eye
i
get
out
of
bed
about
ten
wash
and
sit
by
the
window
in
my
blue
striped
pyjama
suit
it
is
so
hot
i
need
no
additional
clothing
e
comes
in
brushes
my
hair
sprinkles
me
with
lavender
water
lights
my
cigarette
and
gives
me
my
and
books
she
forgets
nothing
from
my
window
i
look
out
on
a
field
with
beech
hedge
down
one
side
and
beyond
tall
trees
one
showing
in
outline
exactly
like
the
profile
of
a
beefeater
head
more
especially
at
sunset
each
evening
when
the
tree
next
behind
is
in
shadow
the
field
is
full
of
blue
scabious
plants
wild
parsley
and
tall
grass
getting
brown
now
in
the
sun
great
numbers
of
white
butterflies
are
continually
rocking
themselves
across
they
go
over
in
coveys
of
four
or
five
at
a
time
i
counted
in
five
minutes
which
bodes
ill
for
the
cabbages
not
even
the
heaviest
thunder
showers
seem
to
debilitate
their
kinetic
ardour
they
rock
on
like
white
aeroplanes
in
a
hail
of
bullets
then
there
are
the
swallows
and
martins
cutting
such
beautiful
figures
thro
the
air
that
one
wishes
they
carried
a
pencil
in
their
bills
as
they
fly
and
traced
the
lines
of
flight
on
a
bristol
board
how
i
hanker
after
the
swallows
so
free
and
gay
and
vigorous
this
autumn
as
they
prepare
to
start
i
shall
hang
on
every
twitter
they
make
and
on
every
and
when
they
have
gone
begin
sadly
to
set
my
house
in
order
as
when
some
much
loved
visitors
have
taken
their
departure
i
am
appreciating
things
a
little
more
the
last
few
days
when
i
resigned
my
appointment
last
month
no
one
knows
what
i
had
to
give
up
but
i
know
tho
if
i
say
what
i
know
no
one
is
compelled
to
believe
me
excepting
out
of
charity
it
will
never
be
discovered
whether
what
i
am
going
to
state
is
not
simply
despairing
bombast
my
few
intimate
friends
and
relatives
are
entirely
innocent
of
science
not
to
say
zoology
and
all
they
realise
is
the
significant
fact
that
i
am
prone
to
go
extravagant
lengths
in
conversation
but
you
may
take
it
or
leave
it
i
was
the
ablest
junior
on
the
staff
and
one
of
the
ablest
zoologists
in
the
place
but
my
ability
was
always
muffled
by
the
inferior
work
they
gave
me
to
do
my
last
memoir
published
last
december
was
the
best
of
its
kind
in
treatment
method
and
technique
that
ever
issued
from
the
institution
i
do
not
say
the
most
important
it
was
trivial
my
work
always
was
trivial
because
they
put
me
in
a
mouldy
department
where
all
the
work
was
trivial
and
the
methods
used
as
primitive
slipshod
and
easy
as
those
of
fabricius
the
idea
being
that
as
i
had
enjoyed
no
academic
career
i
was
unsuited
to
fill
other
posts
then
vacant
one
work
on
the
cœlenterates
and
another
on
both
rarely
favoured
by
amateurs
and
requiring
laboratory
training
later
i
had
the
mortification
of
seeing
these
posts
filled
by
men
whose
powers
i
by
no
means
felt
inclined
to
estimate
as
greater
than
my
own
meanwhile
i
who
had
been
dissecting
for
dear
life
up
and
down
the
whole
animal
kingdom
in
a
poorly
equipped
attic
laboratory
at
home
with
no
adequate
instruments
was
bitterly
disappointed
to
find
still
less
provision
made
even
in
a
scientific
institution
so
grandly
styled
the
british
museum
on
my
first
arrival
i
was
presented
with
a
pen
ink
paper
ruler
and
an
enormous
instrument
of
steel
which
on
enquiry
i
found
to
be
a
paper
cutter
i
asked
for
my
microscope
and
microtome
i
ought
to
have
asked
what
form
i
was
in
so
i
had
to
continue
my
struggle
against
odds
and
only
within
the
last
year
or
so
began
to
squeeze
the
authorities
with
any
success
in
time
i
should
have
revolutionised
the
study
of
systematic
zoology
and
the
anonymous
paper
i
wrote
in
conjunction
with
r
in
the
was
a
rare
and
my
most
important
scientific
work
in
the
literary
world
i
have
fared
no
better
my
first
published
article
appeared
at
the
age
of
over
my
father
name
my
motive
being
not
so
much
modesty
as
cunning
if
the
literary
world
ragged
it
unmercifully
there
was
still
a
chance
left
for
me
to
make
good
my
next
achievement
of
any
magnitude
was
the
unexpected
printing
of
a
story
in
the
after
i
had
unsuccessfully
badgered
almost
every
other
newspaper
this
was
when
i
was
no
proof
had
been
sent
me
and
no
intimation
of
its
acceptance
moreover
there
were
two
ugly
errors
i
at
once
wrote
off
to
correct
them
in
the
next
issue
my
letter
was
neither
published
nor
acknowledged
i
submitted
but
presently
wrote
again
politely
hinting
that
my
cheque
was
overdue
but
screams
of
silence
and
i
thought
it
wise
not
to
complain
in
view
of
future
printing
favours
i
soon
discovered
that
the
journal
had
changed
hands
and
was
probably
on
its
last
legs
at
the
time
of
my
success
as
soon
as
it
grew
financially
sound
again
no
more
of
my
stories
were
accepted
a
more
recent
affair
i
had
with
the
american
which
delighted
me
by
publishing
my
article
but
did
not
pay
tho
the
editor
went
out
of
his
way
to
write
that
payment
was
on
publication
i
did
not
venture
to
remonstrate
as
i
had
another
article
on
the
stocks
which
they
also
printed
without
paying
me
in
spite
of
uniform
failure
my
literary
ambition
has
never
flagged
i
have
for
years
past
received
my
rejected
mss
back
from
every
conceivable
kind
of
periodical
from
to
the
at
one
time
i
used
to
file
their
rejection
forms
and
meditated
writing
a
facetious
essay
on
them
but
i
decided
they
were
too
monotonously
similar
my
custom
was
when
the
ordinary
avenues
to
literary
fame
had
failed
me
the
reviews
and
the
sixpenny
weeklies
to
seek
out
at
a
library
some
obscure
publication
a
parish
magazine
or
the
local
paper
anything
was
grabbed
as
a
last
chance
on
one
of
these
occasions
i
discovered
the
and
immediately
plied
them
with
a
manuscript
and
the
usual
polite
note
after
six
weeks
having
no
reply
i
wrote
again
and
waited
for
another
six
weeks
my
second
remonstrance
met
with
a
similar
fate
so
i
went
into
the
city
to
interview
the
publishers
and
to
demand
my
manuscript
back
the
manager
was
out
and
i
was
asked
to
call
again
after
waiting
about
for
some
time
i
left
my
card
took
my
departure
and
decided
i
would
write
the
same
evening
i
told
the
publishers
that
the
anonymous
editor
would
neither
print
my
article
nor
return
it
would
they
kindly
give
me
his
name
and
address
so
that
i
could
write
personally
after
some
delay
they
replied
that
although
it
was
not
the
custom
to
disclose
the
editor
name
the
following
address
would
find
her
she
was
a
lady
living
in
richmond
row
shepherd
bush
i
wrote
to
her
at
once
and
received
no
answer
meanwhile
i
had
observed
that
no
further
issues
of
the
review
had
appeared
on
the
bookstalls
and
the
were
unable
to
give
me
any
information
i
wrote
again
to
the
address
this
time
a
playful
and
facetious
letter
in
which
i
said
i
did
not
propose
to
take
the
matter
into
court
but
if
it
would
save
her
any
trouble
i
would
call
for
the
as
i
lived
only
a
few
walk
distant
i
received
no
answer
i
was
busy
at
the
time
and
kept
putting
off
executing
my
firm
purpose
of
visiting
the
good
lady
until
one
evening
as
i
was
casually
reading
the
coming
home
in
the
i
read
an
account
of
how
some
charitably
disposed
woman
had
recently
visited
the
hammersmith
workhouse
and
removed
to
her
own
home
a
poor
soul
who
was
once
the
friend
of
george
eliot
george
henry
lewes
and
other
literary
persons
of
the
sixties
and
had
until
it
ceased
publication
a
few
months
before
edited
the
once
notable
recently
however
there
has
been
evidence
of
a
more
benevolent
attitude
towards
me
on
the
part
of
london
editors
a
certain
magnificent
quarterly
has
published
one
or
two
of
my
essays
and
one
of
these
called
forth
two
pages
of
quotation
and
flattering
comment
in
which
thrill
me
to
the
marrow
i
fear
however
the
has
come
too
late
if
this
achievement
impressed
me
it
did
not
seem
to
impress
anyone
else
a
regarded
it
as
a
joke
and
laughed
incredulously
when
someone
told
him
of
eulogy
you
see
i
am
still
his
foolish
little
brother
i
am
secretly
very
nettled
too
because
e
treated
the
whole
matter
very
indifferently
she
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
read
the
critique
and
tho
she
volunteered
to
buy
several
copies
to
send
to
friends
she
never
remembered
to
do
so
and
the
whole
affair
has
passed
out
of
her
mind
now
a
pleasant
paragraph
that
appeared
in
the
press
noticing
some
drawings
of
a
friend
of
her
friend
she
read
twice
and
marched
off
to
francesca
with
it
in
great
glee
another
successful
young
person
got
his
photo
into
the
picture
papers
a
man
we
know
only
by
hearsay
and
yet
it
impressed
her
until
i
recalled
what
strange
to
say
she
had
quite
forgotten
how
the
photographers
wished
to
publish
her
own
photograph
in
the
picture
papers
at
the
time
of
our
marriage
but
she
scornfully
refused
and
so
did
i
but
what
a
queer
woman
and
i
too
a
queer
man
drunken
with
wormwood
and
gall
e
and
i
were
very
modern
in
our
courtship
our
candour
was
mutual
and
complete
parents
and
relatives
would
be
shocked
and
staggered
if
they
knew
you
see
i
am
a
biologist
and
we
are
both
freethinkers
i
hate
all
reticence
and
concealment
there
is
a
good
deal
of
that
ass
gregers
werle
in
my
nature
i
become
dreadfully
emaciated
this
morning
before
getting
off
the
bed
i
lifted
my
leg
and
gazed
wistfully
along
all
its
length
my
flabby
swung
suspended
from
the
like
a
gondola
from
a
zeppelin
i
touched
it
gently
with
the
tip
of
my
index
finger
and
it
oscillated
my
beloved
wife
comes
home
this
evening
after
a
short
much
needed
holiday
my
gratuity
has
turned
out
to
be
unexpectedly
small
i
hoped
at
least
for
one
year
salary
and
the
horrible
thing
is
i
might
live
for
several
years
longer
no
one
was
ever
more
enthusiastic
for
death
than
i
am
at
this
moment
i
hate
this
world
with
its
war
and
i
bitterly
regret
i
never
managed
to
buy
laudanum
in
time
there
are
only
e
and
dear
r
and
one
or
two
others
the
rest
of
the
people
i
know
i
hate
if
only
i
could
get
at
them
i
hate
to
have
to
leave
them
to
themselves
without
getting
my
own
back
my
darling
sweetheart
you
ask
me
why
i
love
you
i
do
not
know
all
i
know
is
that
i
love
you
and
beyond
measure
why
do
love
me
surely
a
more
inscrutable
problem
you
do
not
know
no
one
ever
knows
the
heart
has
its
reasons
which
the
reason
knows
not
of
we
love
in
obedience
to
a
powerful
gravitation
of
our
beings
and
then
try
to
explain
it
by
recapitulating
one
another
characters
just
as
a
man
forms
his
opinions
first
and
then
thinks
out
reasons
in
support
what
delights
me
is
to
recall
that
our
love
has
it
did
not
suddenly
spring
into
existence
like
some
beautiful
sprite
it
developed
slowly
to
perfection
it
was
forged
in
the
white
heat
of
our
experiences
that
is
why
it
will
always
remain
your
love
darling
impregnates
my
heart
touches
it
into
calm
strongly
beating
life
so
that
when
i
am
with
you
i
forget
i
am
a
dying
man
it
is
too
difficult
to
believe
that
when
we
die
true
love
like
ours
disappears
with
our
bodies
my
own
experience
makes
me
feel
that
human
love
is
the
earnest
after
death
of
a
great
reunion
of
souls
in
god
who
is
love
when
as
a
boy
i
was
bending
the
knee
to
haeckel
the
saying
god
is
love
scarcely
interested
me
i
am
wiser
now
you
must
not
think
i
am
still
anything
but
an
infidel
as
the
churchmen
say
i
should
hate
not
to
be
taken
for
an
infidel
and
you
must
not
be
surprised
that
an
embittered
angry
hateful
person
like
myself
should
believe
in
a
gospel
of
love
i
am
embittered
because
an
intense
desire
to
love
has
in
many
instances
been
baulked
by
my
own
idealising
yet
also
analytical
mind
i
have
wanted
to
love
men
blindly
yet
i
am
always
finding
them
out
and
the
disappointment
chills
the
heart
hence
my
malice
and
venom
which
dear
do
not
misconstrue
i
am
as
greedy
as
an
octopus
ready
out
of
love
to
take
the
whole
world
into
my
inside
that
seat
of
the
affections
but
i
am
also
as
sensitive
as
an
octopus
and
quickly
retract
my
arms
into
the
rocky
impregnable
recess
where
i
live
but
am
i
dying
i
have
no
presentiments
no
conviction
like
the
people
you
read
of
in
books
am
i
after
all
in
love
i
dote
yet
doubt
suspect
yet
strongly
love
it
is
all
a
matter
of
degree
beside
abélard
and
héloïse
our
love
may
be
just
glassy
affection
it
is
a
great
and
difficult
question
to
decide
i
love
no
one
else
but
e
that
at
least
is
a
certainty
and
i
have
never
loved
anyone
more
my
bedroom
is
on
the
ground
floor
as
i
can
not
mount
the
stairs
but
the
other
day
when
they
were
all
out
i
determined
to
clamber
upstairs
if
possible
and
search
in
the
bedrooms
for
a
half
bottle
of
laudanum
which
told
me
she
found
the
other
day
in
a
box
a
relic
of
the
time
when
had
to
take
it
to
relieve
pain
i
got
off
the
bed
on
to
the
floor
and
crawled
around
on
hands
and
knees
to
the
door
where
i
knelt
up
straight
reached
the
handle
and
turned
it
then
i
crawled
across
the
hall
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
where
i
sat
down
on
the
bottom
step
and
rested
it
is
a
short
flight
of
only
steps
and
i
soon
reached
the
top
by
sitting
down
on
each
and
raising
myself
up
to
the
next
one
with
my
hands
arrived
at
the
top
i
quickly
decided
on
the
most
likely
room
to
search
first
and
painfully
crawled
along
the
passage
and
thro
the
bathroom
by
the
easiest
route
to
the
small
door
there
are
two
the
handles
of
all
the
doors
in
the
house
are
fixed
some
way
up
above
the
middle
so
that
only
by
kneeling
with
a
straight
back
could
i
reach
them
from
the
floor
this
door
in
addition
was
at
the
top
of
a
high
but
narrow
step
and
i
had
to
climb
on
to
this
balance
myself
carefully
and
then
carefully
pull
myself
up
towards
the
handle
by
means
of
a
towel
hung
on
the
handle
after
three
attempts
i
reached
the
handle
and
found
the
door
locked
on
the
inside
i
collapsed
on
the
floor
and
could
have
cried
i
lay
on
the
floor
of
the
bathroom
resting
with
head
on
my
arm
then
set
my
teeth
and
crawled
around
the
passage
along
two
sides
of
a
square
up
three
more
steps
to
the
other
door
which
i
opened
and
then
entered
i
had
only
examined
two
drawers
containing
only
clothes
when
a
key
turned
in
the
front
door
lock
and
e
entered
with
and
gave
her
usual
whistle
i
closed
the
drawers
and
crawled
out
of
the
room
in
time
to
hear
e
say
in
a
startled
voice
to
her
mother
who
that
upstairs
i
whistled
and
said
that
being
bored
i
had
come
up
to
see
the
cot
which
passed
at
that
time
all
right
next
morning
my
darling
asked
me
why
i
went
upstairs
i
did
not
answer
and
i
think
she
knows
i
am
getting
ill
again
and
can
scarcely
hold
the
pen
so
journal
only
for
a
time
perhaps
have
read
this
blessed
old
journal
out
to
e
it
required
some
courage
and
i
boggled
at
one
or
two
bits
and
left
them
out
some
girls
up
the
road
spent
a
very
wet
sunday
morning
playing
in
their
pyjamas
around
the
tennis
lawn
it
makes
me
envious
to
think
i
never
thought
of
doing
that
and
now
it
is
too
late
they
wore
purple
pyjamas
too
i
once
hugged
myself
with
pride
for
undressing
in
a
cave
by
the
sea
and
bathing
in
the
pouring
rain
but
that
seems
tame
in
comparison
a
perfect
autumn
morning
cool
fine
and
still
what
sweet
music
a
horse
and
cart
make
trundling
slowly
along
a
country
road
on
a
quiet
morning
i
listened
to
it
in
a
happy
mood
of
abstraction
as
it
rolled
on
further
and
further
away
i
put
my
head
out
of
the
window
so
as
to
hear
it
up
to
the
very
last
until
a
robin
notes
relieved
the
nervous
tension
and
helped
me
to
resign
myself
to
my
loss
the
incident
reminded
me
of
the
liebestod
in
tristan
with
the
robin
taking
the
part
of
the
harp
for
days
past
my
emotions
have
been
undergoing
kaleidoscopic
changes
not
only
from
day
to
day
but
from
hour
to
hour
for
ten
minutes
at
a
time
i
am
happy
or
miserable
or
revengeful
venomous
loving
generous
noble
angry
or
murderous
you
could
measure
them
with
a
hell
phantoms
course
across
my
chest
if
i
could
lie
on
this
bed
as
quiet
and
stony
as
an
effigy
on
a
tomb
but
a
moment
ago
i
had
a
sharp
spasm
at
the
sudden
thought
that
never
never
never
again
should
i
walk
thro
the
to
the
uplands
my
birthday
dear
old
r
the
man
i
love
above
all
others
has
been
in
a
military
hospital
for
months
it
is
a
great
hardship
to
have
our
intercourse
almost
completely
cut
off
dear
old
journal
i
love
you
i
could
never
have
believed
so
great
misery
compatible
with
sanity
yet
i
am
quite
sane
how
long
i
or
any
man
can
remain
sane
in
this
condition
god
knows
it
is
a
consummate
vengeance
this
inability
to
write
i
can
not
help
but
smile
grimly
at
the
astuteness
of
the
thrust
to
be
sure
how
cunning
to
deprive
me
of
my
one
secret
consolation
how
amusing
that
in
this
agony
of
isolation
such
an
aggressive
egotist
as
i
should
have
his
last
means
of
cut
off
i
am
being
slowly
stifled
in
handwriting
yesterday
we
shifted
into
a
tiny
cottage
at
half
the
rental
of
the
other
one
and
situated
about
two
miles
further
out
from
the
village
a
wholly
ideal
and
beautiful
little
cottage
you
may
say
but
a
camouflaged
cottage
for
in
spite
of
the
happiness
of
its
exterior
it
contains
just
now
two
of
the
most
dejected
mortals
even
in
this
present
world
last
night
e
sitting
on
the
bed
by
me
burst
into
tears
it
was
my
fault
i
can
stand
a
good
deal
but
there
must
come
a
breaking
point
poor
poor
girl
my
heart
aches
for
you
i
wept
too
and
it
relieved
us
to
cry
we
blew
our
noses
people
who
cry
in
novels
e
observed
with
detachment
never
blow
their
noses
they
just
weep
but
the
thunder
clouds
soon
come
up
again
the
immediate
future
horrifies
me
poushkin
as
we
have
named
the
cat
is
coiled
up
on
my
bed
purring
and
quite
happy
it
does
me
good
to
see
him
but
consider
a
paralytic
a
screaming
infant
two
women
a
cat
and
a
canary
shut
up
in
a
tiny
cottage
with
no
money
the
war
still
on
and
food
always
scarcer
day
by
day
give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread
i
want
to
be
loved
above
all
i
want
to
love
my
great
danger
is
lest
i
grow
maudlin
and
say
petulantly
nobody
loves
me
nobody
cares
i
must
have
more
courage
and
more
confidence
in
other
people
then
i
can
love
more
freely
i
am
grateful
for
some
happy
hours
plucked
triumphantly
from
under
the
very
nose
of
fate
and
spent
in
the
warm
sun
in
the
garden
they
carried
me
out
at
and
i
stayed
till
after
a
lark
sang
but
the
swallows
dear
things
have
gone

picked
two
primroses
i
sat
by
some
michaelmas
daisies

watched
the
bees

butterflies

maudlin

no

of

evening

am
lonely
penniless
paralysed
and
just
turned
but
i
snap
my
fingers
in
your
face
and
with
equal
arrogance
i
pity
you
i
pity
you
your
good
luck
and
the
stagnant
serenity
of
your
mind
i
prefer
my
own
torment
i
am
dying
but
you
are
already
a
corpse
you
have
never

lived
your
body

never

flayed

hopeless
desire
to

do
not
envy
you
your
absorption
in
the
petty
cares
of
a
commonplace
existence
do
you
think
i
would
exchange
the
communion
with
my
own
heart
for
the
toy
balloons
of
your
silly
conversation
or
my
curiosity
for
your
flickering
interests
or
my
despair
for
your
comfortable
hope
or
my
present
tawdry
life
for
yours
as
polished
and
neat
as
a
new
bit
i
would
not
i
gather
my
mantle
around
me
and
i
solemnly
thank
god
that
i
am
not
as
some
other
men
are
i
am
only
but
i
have
telescoped
into
those
few
years
a
tolerably
long
life

have
loved
and
married
