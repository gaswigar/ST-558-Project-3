preface
on
march
a
hundred
years
will
have
passed
since
david
livingstone
was
born
it
is
only
forty
years
since
his
body
was
carried
by
faithful
hands
from
the
centre
of
africa
to
the
coast
that
he
might
be
buried
among
his
peers
in
westminster
abbey
in
those
forty
years
great
and
astounding
changes
have
been
witnessed
in
the
continent
which
is
associated
with
his
fame
the
campaign
he
fought
against
the
that
desolated
the
vast
district
drained
by
the
zambesi
had
to
be
renewed
to
free
the
population
on
the
banks
of
the
congo
southern
africa
has
been
reconstructed
and
consolidated
the
upper
and
the
lower
nile
have
witnessed
many
strange
vicissitudes
of
history
other
names
have
become
great
in
men
s
mouths
some
have
been
associated
with
vast
political
enterprises
while
some
with
a
disinterestedness
as
noble
as
livingstone
s
have
been
at
once
the
pioneers
and
the
martyrs
of
a
christian
civilisation
but
nothing
that
has
happened
since
has
diminished
by
a
single
laurel
the
wreath
he
won
and
will
wear
for
ever
with
every
decade
his
fame
greatens
and
whatever
our
views
on
african
problems
may
be
we
may
all
agree
that
her
white
population
may
well
pray
for
a
double
portion
of
his
spirit
at
first
it
seemed
unnecessary
to
his
life
the
task
has
been
so
well
fulfilled
by
many
sympathetic
biographers
for
anyone
who
has
the
patience
and
the
leisure
it
is
to
be
found
recorded
in
the
fascinating
pages
of
his
journals
but
it
is
so
great
a
possession
that
there
seemed
to
be
room
for
yet
another
attempt
to
present
it
to
those
in
our
busy
century
who
ask
for
short
measure
and
a
clear
simple
narrative
of
facts
this
is
what
the
present
biography
aspires
to
be
the
author
has
aimed
not
so
much
at
telling
the
story
as
at
allowing
the
story
to
tell
itself
it
may
be
added
that
in
the
belief
of
the
writer
livingstone
is
greatest
not
as
a
scientist
nor
an
explorer
but
as
a
man
and
a
missionary

livingstone
chapter
i
the
year
in
which
my
story
opens
was
a
momentous
one
in
the
history
of
europe
the
titanic
struggle
with
napoleon
was
nearing
its
crisis
victor
at
lutzen
and
bautzen
he
had
been
defeated
at
leipzig
on
one
of
the
bloodiest
battlefields
in
modern
warfare
away
in
the
pyrenees
wellington
was
grappling
with
soult
and
step
by
step
driving
him
back
on
to
french
soil
among
those
who
were
fighting
in
the
ranks
of
the
british
army
were
at
least
two
men
bearing
the
name
of
livingstone
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
even
heard
amid
the
excitement
and
peril
of
the
time
that
away
in
peaceful
far
blantyre
and
in
their
brother
neil
s
home
a
lad
had
been
born
and
christened
by
the
good
sound
scriptural
name
of
david
yet
it
may
come
to
be
believed
some
day
that
the
birth
of
david
livingstone
was
of
more
vital
influence
upon
the
destiny
of
the
world
even
than
the
battle
in
which
napoleon
s
star
set
in
blood
two
years
later
for
to
open
up
a
continent
and
lead
the
way
in
the
christianisation
of
its
countless
millions
was
one
of
the
more
renowned
victories
of
peace
a
more
difficult
and
notable
achievement
than
to
overthrow
one
form
of
military
domination
in
europe
the
family
of
livingstones
or
livingstons
for
david
livingstone
himself
spelt
his
name
for
many
years
without
the
final
e
came
from
the
island
of
ulva
off
the
coast
of
argyllshire
not
much
of
interest
is
known
about
them
except
that
one
of
them
died
at
culloden
fighting
for
the
stuarts
so
that
the
fighting
blood
in
their
veins
had
its
way
with
them
before
david
s
more
immediate
kinsmen
crossed
the
seas
to
the
peninsula
the
most
distinguished
member
of
the
family
inherited
the
highlander
s
daring
and
love
of
exploits
combined
with
the
most
pacific
spirit
and
left
behind
him
an
unstained
record
as
an
explorer
who
never
lifted
his
hand
to
do
hurt
to
anyone
through
all
the
perils
of
his
adventurous
career
towards
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
his
grandfather
had
crossed
from
ulva
and
settled
in
blantyre
a
village
on
the
clyde
that
had
certainly
no
romantic
attraction
he
was
employed
in
a
cotton
factory
there
most
of
his
sons
went
off
to
the
wars
but
one
of
them
neil
settled
in
blantyre
as
a
dealer
in
tea
he
had
been
previously
apprenticed
to
david
hunter
a
tailor
and
as
many
a
good
apprentice
has
done
before
him
married
his
master
s
daughter
neil
livingstone
and
his
brave
wife
had
a
hard
fight
of
it
to
make
a
living
out
of
a
small
tea
business
and
to
educate
and
rear
their
children
two
of
the
children
died
in
infancy
but
three
sons
and
two
daughters
grew
up
in
that
humble
home
david
was
the
second
son
he
was
born
on
march
the
small
struggling
tradesman
has
had
little
justice
done
to
him
either
by
the
novelist
or
by
common
repute
he
is
usually
represented
as
a
man
who
can
not
afford
to
keep
a
soul
and
whose
interests
are
limited
to
sordid
and
petty
transactions
across
a
counter
not
always
nor
often
of
a
scrupulous
and
honourable
character
the
reputation
is
very
the
small
shop
has
proved
itself
as
good
a
training
ground
as
any
other
for
scholars
and
saints
and
heroes
and
but
for
the
fact
that
our
prejudices
die
hard
we
should
recognise
that
it
is
so
neil
livingstone
and
his
wife
may
have
lived
a
narrow
life
serving
faithfully
their
customers
and
dividing
their
interests
between
their
family
their
business
and
the
little
independent
chapel
of
which
neil
livingstone
was
a
deacon
but
they
found
their
sphere
large
enough
for
the
practice
of
the
fundamental
christian
virtues
as
well
as
for
the
noblest
of
all
interests
the
interest
in
the
progress
of
the
kingdom
of
god
throughout
the
world
there
was
one
family
tradition
of
which
david
livingstone
was
immensely
proud
a
saying
had
come
down
to
them
attributed
to
an
ancestor
that
in
all
the
family
history
there
was
no
record
of
any
dishonest
man
when
deacon
neil
livingstone
and
his
wife
had
passed
away
the
epitaph
on
their
grave
recorded
the
gratitude
of
their
children
for
poor
and
honest
in
this
simple
and
public
fashion
they
expressed
their
thanks
for
the
honesty
of
one
who
when
he
sold
a
pound
of
tea
gave
neither
short
weight
nor
an
adulterated
article
they
also
gave
thanks
for
the
poverty
of
their
parents
recognising
in
poverty
one
of
those
hard
but
kind
necessities
that
make
for
industry
and
courage
and
patience
and
that
the
children
of
the
poor
oftener
leave
the
world
their
debtor
for
serviceable
activities
than
the
children
of
the
who
have
less
spur
to
their
ambitions
it
was
eminently
characteristic
of
david
livingstone
that
he
should
thus
avow
his
thanks
for
the
honesty
and
poverty
of
his
father
and
mother
there
are
those
still
living
who
recall
the
manly
pride
with
which
he
was
wont
to
refer
to
my
own
order
the
honest
the
mother
of
david
livingstone
was
a
woman
of
great
charm
and
force
of
character
a
delicate
little
woman
with
a
wonderful
flow
of
good
in
her
rare
devoutness
and
sterling
common
sense
were
combined
she
was
the
careful
and
thrifty
housewife
who
had
to
make
every
sixpence
go
as
far
as
possible
but
she
was
remembered
for
her
unfailing
cheerfulness
and
serenity
and
there
was
always
something
to
be
saved
out
of
the
meagre
income
when
the
work
of
the
church
of
christ
needed
extra
support
she
came
of
covenanting
stock
and
her
father
david
hunter
the
tailor
received
his
first
religious
impressions
at
an
service
held
while
the
snow
was
falling
fast
and
used
to
tell
that
so
absorbed
was
he
in
the
realisation
of
the
truth
of
the
gospel
that
though
before
the
end
of
the
sermon
the
snow
was
he
had
no
sensation
of
cold
he
lived
to
be
was
a
close
and
prolific
reader
bore
severe
reverses
of
fortune
with
unflinching
courage
and
earned
the
high
respect
of
the
countryside
it
is
impossible
to
exaggerate
what
david
livingstone
owed
to
the
stock
from
which
he
sprang
and
the
bracing
influences
of
his
early
environment
there
were
two
drawbacks
to
his
home
education
it
seems
that
the
deacon
had
put
two
classes
of
book
on
his
private
index
expurgatorius
as
being
dangerous
novels
and
books
of
science
so
far
as
novels
are
concerned
the
harm
done
was
probably
slight
for
no
one
is
in
the
bible
and
the
pilgrim
s
progress
without
receiving
a
liberal
education
and
the
cultivation
of
the
imagination
while
history
biography
books
of
travel
and
missionary
records
amply
served
the
same
purpose
but
the
proscription
of
books
of
science
was
an
evidence
of
the
old
evil
creed
that
there
is
essential
antagonism
between
science
and
religion
this
assumption
came
near
to
doing
david
permanent
injury
his
religious
difficulties
did
not
disappear
until
in
his
own
words
having
lighted
on
those
admirable
works
of
thomas
dick
the
philosophy
of
religion
and
the
philosophy
of
a
future
state
it
was
gratifying
to
find
that
he
had
enforced
my
own
conviction
that
religion
and
science
were
friendly
to
one
few
people
in
the
nineteenth
century
were
destined
to
do
more
towards
the
practical
reconciliation
of
science
and
religion
than
david
livingstone
it
is
interesting
to
find
that
even
in
his
very
young
days
he
had
a
mind
and
will
of
his
own
and
that
not
even
the
love
and
respect
he
felt
for
his
father
could
shake
his
own
conviction
of
truth
the
last
time
his
father
applied
the
rod
was
when
david
refused
to
read
wilberforce
s
practical
the
boy
thought
the
matter
over
in
his
canny
scotch
way
and
concluded
that
on
the
whole
the
rod
was
the
less
severe
form
of
punishment
so
he
took
the
rod
and
refused
a
religious
book
for
which
he
had
no
use
looking
back
upon
his
own
religious
development
in
after
years
he
used
to
confess
that
at
this
stage
he
was
when
he
was
led
to
see
that
god
and
nature
are
not
at
strife
and
that
god
does
not
say
one
thing
to
the
theologian
and
its
contrary
to
the
scientist
he
accepted
in
his
own
simple
and
sincere
way
the
christian
gospel
and
drew
from
it
the
same
splendid
faith
in
the
universality
of
the
kingdom
of
god
that
inspired
the
souls
of
the
first
apostles
to
david
livingstone
to
become
a
christian
was
to
become
in
spirit
and
desire
a
missionary
it
is
only
necessary
to
add
that
the
faith
which
he
accepted
with
the
full
consent
of
heart
and
mind
as
a
lad
in
blantyre
was
the
faith
in
which
he
died
the
days
of
david
livingstone
s
boyhood
were
great
days
for
missions
the
churches
were
everywhere
awakening
to
their
opportunity
and
responsibility
a
new
acts
of
the
apostles
was
being
written
letters
from
remote
parts
of
the
world
where
the
ancient
battle
between
christ
and
heathenism
was
being
fought
out
anew
were
eagerly
read
and
deeply
pondered
the
romance
and
heroism
of
the
majestic
campaign
captured
and
kindled
both
young
and
old
the
year
of
livingstone
s
birth
was
a
year
of
singular
triumph
in
the
south
seas
it
was
the
year
when
his
great
countryman
robert
morrison
completed
his
translation
of
the
new
testament
into
chinese
when
he
was
some
six
or
seven
years
old
another
famous
scotch
missionary
robert
moffat
was
settling
on
the
kuruman
and
moffat
bore
in
her
arms
a
baby
girl
destined
to
become
david
livingstone
s
wife
the
life
of
henry
martyn
was
a
supreme
call
to
consecration
while
the
story
of
the
heroes
and
heroines
of
the
moravian
missions
was
almost
as
familiar
in
that
humble
scottish
home
as
the
history
of
the
apostle
paul
a
specially
powerful
influence
in
moving
livingstone
to
his
was
the
appeal
of
charles
gutzlaff
for
medical
missionaries
for
china
livingstone
was
a
born
naturalist
and
despite
his
father
s
prejudices
he
made
himself
a
scientist
at
a
very
early
age
searching
old
quarries
for
the
shells
in
the
carboniferous
limestone
scouring
for
simples
and
arranging
the
flora
of
the
district
in
botanical
order
these
expeditions
were
often
very
prolonged
and
involved
the
endurance
of
fatigue
and
hunger
but
the
lad
could
not
be
discouraged
unconsciously
he
was
bracing
himself
physically
for
the
toils
and
tasks
of
after
years
there
is
a
fine
story
about
the
revenge
he
took
upon
his
native
african
escort
on
one
occasion
who
had
been
misguided
enough
to
talk
disrespectfully
about
his
slim
figure
and
shortness
of
stature
thereupon
livingstone
took
them
along
for
two
or
three
days
at
the
top
of
their
speed
till
they
cried
out
for
mercy
he
had
not
scoured
for
simples
for
nothing
his
fearlessness
is
well
illustrated
in
his
daring
and
reckless
exploit
of
climbing
the
ruins
of
bothwell
castle
so
that
he
might
carve
his
name
higher
than
any
other
boy
had
carved
his
there
too
was
the
childlike
ambition
which
remained
with
him
to
the
end
to
do
something
which
nobody
else
could
surpass
no
one
he
wrote
at
the
very
end
of
his
life
on
his
last
expedition
will
cut
me
out
after
this
exploration
is
then
he
adds
finely
and
may
the
good
lord
of
all
help
me
to
show
myself
one
of
his
servants
an
honour
to
my
children
and
perhaps
to
my
country
and
the
story
of
livingstone
is
told
there
it
is
the
story
of
one
of
the
good
lord
s
servants
all
the
drudgery
and
hardship
of
his
lot
went
to
make
him
the
man
he
was
the
days
of
his
boyhood
were
the
good
old
days
the
days
when
children
of
ten
years
old
were
sent
to
work
in
the
factories
and
david
went
with
the
rest
no
eight
hours
day
his
no
humane
legislature
thought
it
wise
and
well
to
forbid
or
curtail
child
labour
from
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
till
eight
o
clock
at
night
he
worked
as
a
piecer
and
all
the
world
knows
how
he
used
to
place
the
book
he
was
studying
on
a
portion
of
the
and
snatch
a
sentence
or
two
as
he
passed
at
his
work
he
tells
us
he
thus
kept
a
pretty
constant
study
undisturbed
by
the
roar
of
machinery
and
that
this
habit
illustration
the
clyde
and
ruins
of
the
old
mill
at
blantyre
illustration
where
livingstone
lived
at
ongar
of
concentration
stood
him
in
good
stead
in
after
years
when
he
wanted
to
read
and
write
even
amidst
the
dancing
and
song
of
as
if
this
were
not
enough
after
a
fourteen
hours
day
in
the
factory

would
go
off

employers

might
have

of
such
severe
and
determined
work
as
this
brought
him
to
university
age
and
as
glasgow
university
was
hard
by
and
as
he
was
promoted
to
be
a
spinner
by
this
time
and
able
to
earn
enough
in
the
summer
to
keep
him
during
the
other
six
months
he
entered
as
a
student
for
greek
and
medicine
and
seems
to
have
successfully
schemed
to
attend
some
divinity
lectures
even
in
the
summer
months
the
scotch
universities
are
the
paradise
of
poor
and
struggling
students
who
have
more
brains
and
character
than
bawbees
but
the
education
was
not
free
in
those
days
the
money
for
fees
had
to
be
pinched
and
scraped
but
it
was
found
somehow
and
in
the
early
winter
of
david
and
his
father
walked
to
the
city
from
blantyre
and
trudged
the
streets
of
glasgow
all
day
with
the
snow
upon
the
ground
till
at
last
they
found
a
room
in
rotten
row
that
could
be
had
for
two
shillings
a
week
lodged
thus
as
cheaply
as
could
be
managed
he
applied
himself
with
all
his
unfailing
diligence
and
zest
to
learn
greek
and
medicine
as
well
as
to
such
theological
studies
as
could
be
undertaken
under
the
leadership
of
the
rev
wardlaw
one
of
glasgow
s
most
famous
divines
who
trained
men
for
the
congregational
ministry
and
for
whom
livingstone
had
a
great
admiration
during
his
second
session
at
glasgow
david
livingstone
came
to
the
most
fateful
decision
of
his
life
he
decided
to
offer
himself
to
one
of
the
missionary
societies
for
foreign
service
he
chose
the
london
missionary
society
because
of
his
sympathy
with
the
catholicity
of
its
basis
it
existed
to
send
neither
episcopacy
nor
presbyterianism
nor
independency
to
the
heathen
but
the
gospel
of
this
said
livingstone
exactly
agreed
with
my
he
was
a
member
of
a
congregational
church
and
the
london
missionary
society
has
always
been
in
the
main
supported
by
these
churches
but
the
society
was
founded
by
evangelical
churchmen
and
prominent
presbyterians
as
well
as
by
congregationalists
and
nothing
appealed
more
to
livingstone
than
this
union
of
christian
people
in
the
service
of
an
world
in
due
course
the
acceptance
of
his
offer
arrived
and
in
the
early
autumn
of
he
travelled
to
london
where
he
was
to
appear
before
the
mission
board
at
aldersgate
street
one
can
imagine
that
apart
altogether
from
the
momentous
character
of
his
visit
and
the
anxiety
he
must
have
felt
as
to
his
acceptance
by
the
directors
this
first
visit
to
london
must
have
been
a
most
impressive
one
to
the
young
scotsman
he
heard
many
distinguished
preachers
and
visited
the
famous
sites
of
london
among
other
places
he
went
with
a
companion
to
westminster
abbey
it
is
a
thrilling
thought
as
thomas
hughes
reminds
us
that
he
was
never
known
to
enter
that
abbey
again
until
his
remains
were
borne
thither
amid
the
lamentations
of
the
whole
civilised
world
and
all
the
honours
that
the
living
can
ever
pay
to
the
dead
the
examination
by
the
directors
was
satisfactory
and
according
to
the
custom
of
the
time
livingstone
was
committed
for
a
short
period
of
probation
to
the
tutorship
of
the
rev
richard
cecil
the
minister
of
the
little
town
of
chipping
ongar
in
essex
there
he
was
expected
to
give
proof
of
his
preaching
ministry
with
what
result
is
generally
known
he
was
sent
one
sunday
evening
to
preach
in
the
village
of
stanford
rivers
where
the
tradition
of
livingstone
s
first
effort
at
preaching
is
still
cherished
the
raw
somewhat
scotch
youth
to
whom
public
speech
was
always
a
difficulty
gave
out
his
text
very
that
was
all
the
congregation
got
the
sermon
composed
on
the
text
had
fled
owing
to
the
nervous
embarrassment
produced
by
a
handful
of
people
in
a
village
chapel
friends
said
the
youth
i
have
forgotten
all
i
had
to
say
and
hurrying
out
of
the
pulpit
he
left
the
i
have
no
doubt
that
hurrying
is
the
right
word
never
was
failure
more
absolute
it
is
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
rev
richard
cecil
reported
to
the
directors
his
fears
that
livingstone
had
mistaken
his
vocation
it
was
a
risk
to
send
someone
to
preach
to
the
heathen
who
might
possibly
forget
what
he
had
come
to
say
when
he
arrived
moreover
criticism
was
made
of
his
extreme
slowness
and
hesitancy
in
prayer
yet
the
man
who
was
nearly
rejected
by
the
society
on
this
account
died
on
his
knees
in
the
heart
of
africa
while
all
the
world
was
awed
by
the
thought
that
david
livingstone
passed
away
in
the
act
of
prayer
as
it
was
his
probation
was
extended
and
at
the
end
of
another
two
months
he
was
finally
accepted
and
went
up
to
london
to
continue
his
medical
studies
in
the
london
hospitals
one
of
the
most
striking
things
ever
written
about
him
was
by
the
celebrated
isaac
taylor
of
ongar
now
after
nearly
forty
years
he
writes
i
remember
his
step
the
characteristic
forward
tread
firm
simple
resolute
neither
fast
nor
slow
no
hurry
and
no
dawdle
but
which
evidently
meant
getting
there
in
november
he
was
able
to
return
to
glasgow
and
qualify
as
a
licentiate
of
the
faculty
of
physicians
and
surgeons
and
a
few
days
later
he
said
goodbye
to
the
old
folks
at
home
one
of
whom
his
father
he
was
never
to
see
on
earth
again
on
november
he
was
ordained
at
albion
chapel
london
and
three
weeks
later
he
sailed
on
the
george
to
algoa
bay
in
south
africa
one
chapter
in
his
memorable
life
was
now
definitely
closed
among
the
memories
in
it
there
are
few
if
any
that
he
cherished
more
than
that
of
his
old
sunday
school
teacher
david
hogg
who
sent
for
him
as
he
lay
dying
and
said
now
lad
make
religion
the
business
of
your
life
and
not
a
thing
of
fits
and
starts
for
if
you
do
temptation
and
other
things
will
get
the
better
of
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
the
old
man
s
counsel
became
the
watchword
of
his
life
chapter
ii
a
voyage
of
five
months
saw
livingstone
at
algoa
bay
preparing
for
his
first
journey
into
the
interior
of
africa
the
grave
of
so
many
reputations
but
the
land
of
his
renown
until
within
a
short
time
of
his
departure
from
london
he
had
hoped
and
intended
to
go
to
china
as
a
medical
missionary
but
the
opium
war
was
still
in
progress
and
for
the
time
being
china
was
impossible
moreover
livingstone
was
brought
under
the
influence
of
one
of
the
greatest
personalities
in
modern
missionary
enterprise
robert
moffat
was
home
on
furlough
and
his
wonderful
story
no
less
than
his
striking
presence
exerted
their
spell
over
the
young
scot
and
changed
the
goal
of
his
ambition
moffat
was
wont
to
describe
the
numberless
african
villages
stretching
away
to
the
north
where
no
missionary
had
yet
penetrated
and
his
appeal
found
a
ready
response
in
livingstone
s
heart
none
of
us
who
have
heard
the
old
man
eloquent
and
on
whose
memories
the
stately
striking
figure
with
the
flowing
beard
and
the
tousled
hair
made
an
indelible
impression
will
wonder
that
any
young
man
s
imagination
should
be
kindled
by
his
address
or
should
discover
in
the
mysterious
depths
of
the
vast
african
continent
the
field
for
his
life
work
it
was
to
moffat
s
station
at
kuruman
that
david
livingstone
took
his
first
journey
the
distance
was
seven
hundred
miles
and
he
immediately
surrendered
to
the
interest
and
delight
of
travel
by
ox
waggon
the
freedom
of
the
open
air
life
the
variety
of
the
scenery
and
sport
and
the
attractiveness
of
the
natives
who
engaged
his
sympathy
from
the
first
it
was
now
that
his
hardy
training
in
scotland
stood
him
in
good
stead
he
knew
how
to
put
up
with
inconveniences
cheerfully
and
face
difficulties
with
resolution
while
his
resourcefulness
was
as
inexhaustible
as
his
kindliness
that
characteristic
forward
tread
of
which
isaac
taylor
had
spoken
which
meant
getting
there
was
put
to
the
proof
and
not
found
wanting
to
him
there
was
a
way
out
of
every
situation
however
critical
and
the
bold
free
course
which
he
took
with
the
natives
together
with
his
medical
skill
and
unwearying
goodness
won
their
loyalty
they
recognised
him
as
a
great
chief
and
his
whole
career
is
eloquent
of
the
extraordinary
devotion
which
he
inspired
in
them
at
the
end
of
may
he
was
at
kuruman
with
instructions
from
the
directors
of
the
society
to
turn
his
attention
to
the
north
instructions
that
absolutely
coincided
with
his
own
aspiration
it
is
notable
that
he
formed
the
very
highest
opinion
of
the
value
of
christian
missions
from
the
results
that
he
saw
let
it
be
remembered
that
he
was
always
a
slow
cautious
scot
in
all
his
judgments
with
a
severely
truthful
and
scientific
mind
and
his
testimony
becomes
the
more
valuable
everything
i
witnessed
surpassed
my
hopes
he
writes
home
if
this
is
a
fair
sample
the
statements
of
the
missionaries
as
to
their
success
are
far
within
the
he
is
full
of
the
praises
of
the
christian
hottentots
who
are
far
superior
in
attainments
to
what
i
had
expected
their
worship
reminded
him
of
the
old
covenanters
it
was
thus
then
that
with
his
zeal
for
his
mission
of
evangelism
greatly
stimulated
he
started
north
to
the
country
of
the
bakwains
a
short
circuit
sufficed
to
reveal
the
problem
and
he
returned
to
kuruman
to
think
out
the
best
plan
of
campaign
the
first
step
was
a
characteristic
one
it
was
to
isolate
himself
absolutely
from
all
european
society
and
live
among
the
natives
so
as
to
learn
their
language
and
study
their
habits
and
their
laws
for
six
months
he
rigorously
pursued
his
plan
and
found
his
reward
in
the
new
appreciation
he
gained
of
the
native
character
and
mode
of
thinking
and
the
extent
to
which
he
conquered
their
confidences
so
far
advanced
had
he
become
in
the
knowledge
of
their
language
that
he
was
able
to
enjoy
a
laugh
at
himself
for
turning
one
can
believe
that
to
livingstone
this
was
no
easy
work
but
he
succeeded
in
making
sechuana
translations
of
several
hymns
which
were
afterwards
adopted
and
printed
by
the
french
missionaries
if
they
had
been
bad
he
says
in
his
naïve
way
i
don
t
see
that
they
can
have
had
any
motive
for
using
he
was
waiting
now
for
the
final
decision
of
the
directors
authorising
the
advance
into
the
unoccupied
district
of
the
north
the
decision
was
long
in
coming
we
must
recognise
that
such
a
resolution
was
not
an
easy
one
for
those
who
carried
all
the
responsibilities
at
home
even
their
most
trusted
advisers
on
the
actual
field
were
not
agreed
philip
the
special
representative
of
the
society
at
the
cape
and
a
man
of
great
personal
power
and
sagacity
shook
his
head
over
livingstone
s
impetuosity
and
talked
about
the
dangers
if
we
wait
till
there
is
no
danger
said
livingstone
we
shall
never
go
at
it
was
quite
true
but
there
were
big
problems
of
policy
to
be
decided
many
held
by
the
watchword
concentration
which
is
always
plausible
and
often
conclusive
settlements
for
educational
and
industrial
developments
had
proved
their
value
on
the
other
hand
livingstone
had
unanswerable
logic
on
his
side
when
he
argued
that
the
missionaries
in
the
south
had
too
scanty
a
population
and
that
the
call
to
possess
the
north
was
urgent
for
the
traders
and
the
slavers
were
pushing
out
there
and
the
gospel
of
humanity
was
imperatively
needed
there
was
long
delay
but
in
the
meantime
livingstone
was
making
proof
of
his
ministry
his
medical
knowledge
helped
to
spread
his
fame
he
fought
the
rainmakers
at
their
own
arts
with
the
scientific
weapon
of
irrigation
and
won
his
battle
he
made
friends
with
the
bechuana
chief
sechele
one
of
the
most
intelligent
and
interesting
of
the
many
great
natives
who
surrendered
to
the
charm
of
livingstone
sechele
was
deeply
impressed
by
the
missionary
s
message
but
profoundly
troubled
in
spirit
he
said
you
startle
me
these
words
make
all
my
bones
to
shake
i
have
no
more
strength
in
me
but
my
forefathers
were
living
at
the
same
time
yours
were
and
how
is
it
that
they
did
not
send
them
word
about
these
terrible
things
sooner
they
all
passed
away
into
darkness
without
knowing
whither
they
were
when
livingstone
tried
to
explain
to
him
the
gradual
spread
of
the
gospel
knowledge
the
chief
refused
to
believe
that
the
whole
earth
could
be
visited
there
was
a
barrier
at
his
very
door
the
kalahari
desert
nobody
could
cross
it
even
those
who
knew
the
country
would
perish
and
no
missionary
would
have
a
chance
as
for
his
own
people
there
was
no
difficulty
in
converting
them
always
assuming
that
livingstone
would
go
to
work
in
the
right
way
do
you
imagine
these
people
will
ever
believe
by
your
merely
talking
to
them
i
can
make
them
do
nothing
except
by
thrashing
them
and
if
you
like
i
will
call
my
and
with
our
litupa
whips
of
rhinoceros
hide
we
will
soon
make
them
all
believe
it
must
be
confessed
however
that
sechele
s
principles
did
not
commend
themselves
to
the
mind
of
an
ardent
voluntaryist
like
livingstone
in
our
relations
with
the
people
he
writes
we
were
simply
strangers
exercising
no
authority
or
control
whatever
our
influence
depended
entirely
on
persuasion
and
having
taught
them
by
kind
conversation
as
well
as
by
public
instruction
i
expected
them
to
do
what
their
own
sense
of
right
and
wrong
he
then
sets
on
record
five
instances
in
which
by
our
influence
on
public
opinion
war
was
prevented
and
pays
a
high
tribute
to
the
intelligence
of
the
natives
who
in
many
respects
excel
our
own
uneducated
this
attitude
of
appreciation
and
respectful
sympathy
was
the
secret
of
livingstone
s
unparalleled
influence
over
the
african
tribes
it
was
on
a
return
from
a
visit
to
sechele
in
june
that
livingstone
heard
the
good
news
of
the
formal
sanction
of
the
forward
movement
he
hailed
the
decision
as
he
said
with
inexpressible
delight
and
in
a
fine
letter
written
to
cecil
declared
his
fixed
resolve
to
give
less
attention
to
the
art
of
physical
healing
and
more
to
spiritual
amelioration
he
has
no
ambition
to
be
a
very
good
doctor
but
a
useless
drone
of
a
he
feels
that
to
carry
out
this
purpose
will
involve
some
but
he
will
make
the
sacrifice
cheerfully
as
for
the
charge
of
ambition
i
really
am
ambitious
to
preach
beyond
other
men
s
lines
i
am
only
determined
to
go
on
and
do
all
i
can
while
able
for
the
poor
degraded
people
of
the
in
less
than
two
months
he
was
ready
for
the
new
move
the
first
journey
was
two
hundred
miles
to
the
to
mabotsa
which
he
had
previously
noted
as
suitable
for
a
station
here
he
built
a
house
with
his
own
hands
and
settled
down
for
three
years
work
among
the
bakatlas
during
this
period
two
events
occurred
that
were
especially
notable
the
first
went
far
towards
ending
his
career
the
facts
are
from
livingstone
s
own
graphic
but
simple
description
he
had
gone
with
the
bakatlas
to
hunt
some
lions
which
had
committed
serious
depredations
in
the
village
the
lions
were
encircled
by
the
natives
but
broke
through
the
line
and
escaped
as
livingstone
was
returning
however
he
saw
one
of
the
beasts
on
a
small
hill
and
fired
into
him
at
about
thirty
yards
distance
loading
again
he
heard
a
shout
and
looking
saw
the
lion
just
in
the
act
of
springing
upon
the
lion
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
and
growling
horribly
close
to
my
ear
he
shook
me
as
a
terrier
dog
does
a
we
now
see
the
advantage
of
a
scientific
education
livingstone
was
able
to
analyse
his
own
feelings
and
emotions
during
the
process
of
being
gnawed
by
a
lion
he
observed
that
the
shock
produced
a
stupor
a
sort
of
dreaminess
there
was
no
sense
of
pain
nor
feeling
of
he
compares
it
to
the
influence
of
chloroform
and
argues
that
this
peculiar
state
is
probably
produced
in
all
animals
killed
by
the
carnivora
and
if
so
is
a
merciful
provision
by
our
benevolent
creator
for
lessening
the
pain
of
in
this
judgment
he
anticipated
some
illustration
livingstone
attacked
by
a
lion
weighty
modern
conclusions
by
noted
physiologists
so
interesting
does
livingstone
find
these
observations
that
it
seems
as
if
he
must
have
been
almost
disappointed
when
the
lion
released
him
and
turned
his
attention
to
others
less
well
equipped
for
scientific
investigation
on
the
whole
livingstone
escaped
marvellously
well
but
the
bone
was
crunched
into
splinters
and
there
were
eleven
teeth
wounds
on
the
upper
part
of
his
arm
the
arm
indeed
was
never
really
well
again
it
will
be
remembered
that
it
was
by
the
false
joint
in
this
limb
that
the
remains
of
livingstone
were
identified
on
their
arrival
in
england
it
will
also
be
remembered
that
as
has
been
so
well
said
for
thirty
years
afterwards
all
his
labours
and
adventures
entailing
such
exertion
and
fatigue
were
undertaken
with
a
limb
so
maimed
that
it
was
painful
for
him
to
raise
a
or
in
fact
to
place
the
left
arm
in
any
position
above
the
level
of
the
this
was
a
bad
business
but
providence
has
a
way
of
making
up
to
good
men
for
afflictions
of
this
kind
and
livingstone
s
compensation
came
to
him
in
the
following
year
when
he
had
something
to
face
that
demanded
more
daring
than
a
mere
encounter
with
lions
he
had
been
a
bachelor
in
africa
for
four
years
and
he
had
resolved
to
try
his
fortune
with
mary
moffat
moffat
s
eldest
daughter
the
proposal
was
made
beneath
one
of
the
fruit
trees
at
kuruman
in
he
got
the
answer
he
desired
and
deserved
and
mary
moffat
took
him
with
all
his
erratic
ways
and
became
his
devoted
wife
she
was
always
the
best
spoke
in
the
wheel
at
home
he
writes
and
when
i
took
her
with
me
on
two
occasions
to
lake
ngami
and
far
beyond
she
endured
more
than
some
who
have
written
large
books
of
in
course
of
time
three
sons
and
a
daughter
came
to
cheer
their
solitude
and
increase
their
responsibilities
but
from
the
first
they
set
themselves
to
fulfil
what
livingstone
called
the
ideal
missionary
life
the
husband
a
and
the
wife
a
the
catalogue
of
necessary
accomplishments
sounds
somewhat
embarrassing
and
one
realises
that
the
ordinary
college
training
is
in
many
respects
incomplete
here
it
is
as
livingstone
expresses
it
building
gardening
cobbling
doctoring
tinkering
carpentering
farriering
preaching
schooling
lecturing
on
physics
occupying
a
chair
in
divinity
and
helping
my
wife
to
make
soap
candles
and
it
was
certainly
a
busy
and
catholic
career
he
was
carrying
the
whole
of
his
world
upon
his
own
broad
shoulders
and
was
guide
philosopher
and
friend
to
a
vast
district
he
had
his
enemies
too
as
those
who
champion
the
rights
of
the
poor
and
helpless
are
sure
to
have
to
the
north
were
to
be
found
settlements
of
unscrupulous
and
marauding
boers
who
held
by
all
the
unenlightened
views
of
the
relation
of
the
white
races
to
the
black
which
were
only
recently
extinct
in
england
where
the
financial
interest
in
slavery
died
hard
in
these
boer
marauders
lived
largely
on
and
on
pillage
and
livingstone
was
brought
into
open
conflict
with
them
on
one
side
they
may
be
said
to
have
barred
his
advance
the
tribes
he
served
and
loved
lived
under
the
shadow
of
a
boer
invasion
the
time
was
to
come
when
the
cloud
would
burst
over
sechele
and
his
unoffending
people
when
his
wives
would
be
slain
and
his
children
carried
away
into
slavery
when
many
of
the
bravest
of
his
people
would
be
massacred
and
livingstone
s
house
sacked
and
gutted
in
his
absence
this
complicity
of
the
northern
boers
in
those
outrages
on
native
tribes
which
history
most
frequently
associates
with
the
portuguese
earned
livingstone
s
stern
indignation
and
detestation
though
he
never
did
the
boers
of
south
africa
the
injustice
of
confounding
the
lawless
raiders
with
the
main
body
of
settlers
of
whom
he
wrote
the
boers
generally
are
a
sober
industrious
and
most
hospitable
body
of
he
had
however
already
begun
to
have
glimpses
of
what
his
was
to
be
he
saw
that
the
curse
of
africa
lay
not
only
in
the
eternal
conflicts
of
tribe
with
tribe
that
form
of
misery
was
original
to
the
continent
and
its
savage
inhabitants
but
a
new
curse
had
fallen
upon
the
unhappy
people
by
the
intrusion
of
those
who
united
with
a
higher
material
civilisation
a
more
developed
and
refined
form
of
cruelty
the
diabolical
cunning
and
callousness
that
under
the
guise
of
trading
would
gain
the
confidence
of
a
peaceful
tribe
only
at
last
to
rise
up
some
fatal
night
murder
the
old
enslave
the
young
burn
the
huts
and
march
the
chained
gang
hundreds
of
miles
to
the
sea
have
made
the
records
of
african
slavery
the
most
awful
reading
in
human
history
imagination
carries
the
story
one
step
further
we
hardly
need
the
genius
of
a
turner
to
suggest
to
us
the
horror
of
a
under
the
torrid
tropical
skies
with
its
dead
and
dying
human
freight
when
the
is
realised
in
all
its
accumulated
horrors
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
to
a
man
of
livingstone
s
noble
christian
sensibility
the
manifest
duty
of
the
church
of
christ
was
to
engage
in
a
struggle
against
this
darkest
of
all
inhumanities
he
was
planning
his
campaign
during
the
years
when
he
passed
with
his
wife
and
children
from
one
settlement
to
another
three
houses
he
built
with
his
own
hands
and
made
some
progress
in
the
cultivation
of
gardens
round
them
the
first
was
at
mabotsa
it
was
the
home
to
which
he
brought
his
young
bride
and
to
leave
it
went
to
his
heart
his
going
was
the
result
of
the
attitude
adopted
towards
him
by
a
brother
missionary
sooner
than
cause
scandal
among
the
tribe
he
resolved
to
give
everything
up
and
go
elsewhere
paradise
will
make
amends
for
all
our
privations
and
sorrows
here
he
says
simply
it
is
something
to
know
that
the
missionary
who
did
him
this
injustice
lived
to
manifest
a
very
different
livingstone
next
cast
in
his
lot
with
sechele
and
his
people
and
built
his
second
house
at
chonuane
some
forty
miles
from
mabotsa
it
was
hard
work
and
it
made
a
big
drain
on
his
very
small
income
but
it
was
not
his
way
to
complain
the
hardship
fell
more
severely
on
his
wife
and
infant
children
and
he
felt
the
deprivations
and
inconveniences
most
for
them
the
house
was
finished
in
course
of
time
and
a
school
was
erected
too
where
the
children
were
instructed
and
services
held
but
nature
was
against
a
long
settlement
at
chonuane
a
period
of
prolonged
drought
set
in
supplies
were
exhausted
the
people
had
to
go
further
afield
and
the
position
became
untenable
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
for
the
livingstones
to
go
too
all
the
labour
of
rebuilding
had
to
be
undertaken
again
this
time
at
kolobeng
another
forty
miles
on
providence
was
indeed
to
livingstone
like
as
an
eagle
stirring
up
the
such
of
the
tribe
as
were
left
went
with
him
and
a
new
village
was
constructed
livingstone
and
his
family
lived
for
a
year
in
a
mere
in
the
new
house
was
actually
built
despite
some
serious
personal
accidents
of
which
he
made
light
in
his
usual
way
what
a
mercy
to
be
in
a
house
again
he
writes
home
a
year
in
a
little
hut
through
which
the
wind
blew
our
candles
into
glorious
icicles
as
a
poet
would
say
by
night
and
in
which
crowds
of
flies
continually
settled
on
the
eyes
of
our
poor
little
brats
by
day
makes
us
value
our
present
castle
oh
janet
know
thou
if
thou
art
given
to
building
castles
in
the
air
that
that
is
easy
work
compared
to
erecting
cottages
on
the
ground
such
was
the
building
of
his
third
house
the
one
that
was
afterwards
sacked
by
the
boers
then
he
built
no
more
houses
indeed
he
never
had
a
home
of
his
own
in
africa
afterwards
the
dark
problem
of
central
africa
had
him
in
its
grip
he
sent
his
wife
and
children
home
to
england
and
he
himself
became
like
that
son
of
man
whose
example
he
followed
so
nearly
one
who
had
not
where
to
lay
his
before
that
time
came
however
he
had
laid
the
foundations
of
his
fame
as
an
explorer
by
crossing
the
kalahari
desert
and
discovering
lake
ngami
the
circumstances
that
gave
rise
to
this
journey
are
easily
detailed
the
drought
continued
at
kolobeng
as
pitilessly
as
at
chonuane
only
the
power
of
livingstone
s
personality
sufficed
to
retain
the
faith
and
loyalty
of
the
tribes
he
writes
that
they
were
always
treated
with
respectful
kindness
and
never
had
an
enemy
among
the
natives
his
enemies
were
among
the
dirty
whites
who
knew
that
he
was
the
most
dangerous
obstacle
to
the
and
who
objected
to
his
policy
of
training
christian
native
teachers
to
be
evangelists
among
their
own
kinsfolk
but
though
the
tribes
remained
loyal
the
fact
remained
that
livingstone
had
led
a
migration
which
had
not
resulted
in
a
permanent
settlement
neither
could
he
command
the
rain
as
their
own
rainmakers
professed
to
be
able
to
do
the
heathen
superstition
that
hostile
doctors
had
put
their
country
under
an
evil
charm
so
that
no
rain
should
fall
on
it
prevailed
even
against
their
faith
in
the
missionary
sechele
s
more
enlightened
mind
found
it
difficult
to
understand
why
livingstone
s
god
did
not
answer
the
prayer
for
rain
yet
the
work
went
forward
at
kolobeng
the
chief
sechele
after
long
hesitation
on
livingstone
s
part
was
baptised
and
entered
into
communion
with
the
little
church
trouble
followed
when
he
went
home
gave
each
of
his
superfluous
wives
new
clothing
and
all
his
own
goods
which
they
had
been
accustomed
to
keep
in
their
huts
for
him
and
sent
them
to
their
parents
with
an
intimation
that
he
had
no
fault
to
find
with
them
but
that
in
parting
with
them
he
wished
to
follow
the
will
of
it
was
his
solution
of
a
social
problem
that
can
never
be
satisfactorily
solved
and
it
was
both
courageous
and
generous
but
the
result
was
seen
in
the
fiercer
resentment
of
the
relatives
of
the
women
and
while
little
or
none
of
this
fell
upon
livingstone
it
served
seriously
to
prejudice
the
religion
which
was
responsible
for
sechele
s
action
on
every
count
it
was
desirable
to
find
the
new
and
permanent
station
where
that
central
for
native
missionaries
could
be
established
which
livingstone
had
constantly
in
view
and
where
the
water
supply
would
be
less
likely
to
fail
but
where
to
go
in
the
south
the
field
was
well
supplied
with
missionaries
to
the
east
were
the
unfriendly
dutch
bent
on
making
mischief
to
the
north
lay
the
kalahari
desert
which
sechele
had
pronounced
to
be
an
impassable
barrier
to
the
progress
of
christianity
it
is
utterly
impossible
even
to
us
black
men
he
said
but
the
word
impossible
was
not
in
livingstone
s
dictionary
if
my
readers
will
take
the
trouble
to
look
at
an
old
map
of
south
africa
they
will
find
the
whole
vast
track
of
the
west
which
lies
to
the
north
of
the
orange
river
and
includes
bechuana
land
and
damara
land
described
as
desert
and
the
kalahari
desert
in
the
eastern
portion
of
it
kolobeng
lay
at
the
extreme
west
of
what
we
know
as
the
transvaal
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
pretoria
and
was
more
than
four
thousand
feet
above
sea
level
near
the
sources
of
the
limpopo
river
which
flows
north
and
east
until
it
finally
joins
the
ocean
at
delagoa
bay
a
straight
line
to
lake
ngami
would
have
taken
the
travellers
in
a
direction
a
distance
of
little
more
than
three
hundred
miles
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
could
have
survived
such
a
journey
across
an
untrodden
route
even
if
they
had
known
accurately
where
the
great
lake
lay
they
were
certainly
well
inspired
to
go
due
north
to
the
zouga
river
and
then
follow
it
westward
to
the
lake
though
this
route
must
have
added
two
hundred
miles
to
their
journey
three
other
europeans
colonel
steele
murray
and
oswell
the
latter
one
of
livingstone
s
friends
and
a
mighty
african
hunter
joined
the
expedition
which
started
on
june
and
reached
the
lake
on
august
livingstone
has
given
us
a
most
graphic
and
detailed
description
of
the
desert
with
its
sandy
soil
its
dry
beds
of
ancient
rivers
its
trackless
plains
its
prairie
grass
its
patches
of
bushes
and
the
singular
products
of
its
soil
with
roots
like
large
turnips
that
hold
fluid
beneath
the
soil
and
above
all
the
desert
on
which
the
bushmen
as
well
as
the
elephants
and
antelopes
and
even
lions
and
hyænas
subsist
the
bushmen
he
found
a
thin
wiry
merry
race
capable
of
great
endurance
as
indeed
the
denizens
of
the
desert
must
be
they
existed
under
conditions
that
inspired
the
bechuana
with
terror
for
to
add
to
the
other
dangers
the
desert
was
at
times
infested
with
serpents
it
was
a
hazardous
enterprise
to
which
livingstone
and
his
fellow
travellers
were
committed
and
humanly
speaking
its
success
depended
wholly
on
the
discovery
of
water
at
periodical
intervals
the
caravan
was
a
considerable
one
eighty
cattle
and
twenty
horses
were
not
deemed
too
many
for
the
waggons
and
for
riding
these
had
to
be
watered
and
the
twenty
men
besides
progress
was
necessarily
slow
none
could
face
the
burning
heat
of
the
hours
they
had
to
move
forward
in
the
mornings
and
the
evenings
the
sank
deep
into
the
soft
hot
sand
and
the
poor
oxen
dragging
them
laboriously
forward
were
at
a
critical
time
nearly
four
days
without
water
and
their
masters
scarcely
better
aided
however
by
the
experience
and
keen
instinct
of
the
natives
they
found
wells
in
unsuspected
places
and
eventually
made
the
banks
of
the
zouga
river
after
that
progress
was
easy
leaving
the
waggons
and
oxen
they
took
to
canoes
or
wended
their
way
along
the
riverbanks
until
on
the
morning
of
august
they
found
themselves
gazing
on
the
waters
of
lake
ngami
the
first
white
people
to
see
it
so
far
as
they
knew
it
had
been
one
of
the
principal
arguments
with
livingstone
for
the
journey
that
he
would
meet
the
famous
chief
sebituane
who
had
saved
the
life
of
sechele
in
his
infancy
and
who
was
renowned
as
a
warrior
and
as
a
powerful
and
intelligent
ruler
it
meant
another
two
hundred
miles
of
travel
to
the
north
and
the
jealousies
of
the
chiefs
and
their
real
or
assumed
fears
for
livingstone
s
safety
prevented
the
realisation
of
his
hopes
on
this
journey
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
back
to
kolobeng
where
the
drought
persisted
as
absolute
as
ever
livingstone
s
congregation
and
livingstone
s
school
had
disappeared
in
search
of
better
watered
lands
it
was
clear
that
for
livingstone
there
was
here
no
abiding
he
resolved
to
transport
his
wife
and
three
children
to
the
north
he
made
more
of
an
eastward
circuit
this
time
and
sechele
accompanied
them
to
the
fords
of
the
zouga
livingstone
was
the
first
white
lady
to
see
lake
ngami
but
the
purposed
visit
to
sebituane
had
again
to
be
deferred
livingstone
s
aid
was
invoked
for
a
party
of
englishmen
who
were
hunting
ivory
one
was
already
dead
but
the
others
recovered
under
his
treatment
his
own
children
however
sickened
and
the
party
precipitately
retired
to
the
pure
air
of
the
desert
and
so
home
to
kolobeng
where
another
child
was
born
to
them
only
to
be
carried
away
by
an
epidemic
hers
is
the
first
grave
in
all
that
country
writes
the
bereaved
father
marked
as
the
of
one
of
whom
it
is
believed
and
confessed
that
she
shall
live
after
a
visit
to
kuruman
to
rest
and
recruit
they
were
ready
in
april
for
a
third
attempt
to
reach
sebituane
oswell
the
most
valuable
of
comrades
was
again
with
them
the
journey
was
successful
but
it
came
dangerously
near
to
being
disastrous
to
the
whole
family
this
crisis
occurred
on
the
far
side
of
the
zouga
river
as
they
were
travelling
northward
across
absolute
desert
the
bushman
guide
lost
his
way
and
the
supply
of
water
in
the
waggons
had
been
wasted
by
one
of
the
servants
livingstone
tells
the
incident
in
a
single
paragraph
but
the
agony
of
it
must
nearly
have
killed
him
and
his
wife
the
next
morning
the
less
there
was
of
water
the
more
thirsty
the
little
rogues
became
the
idea
of
their
perishing
before
our
eyes
was
terrible
it
would
almost
have
been
a
relief
to
me
to
have
been
reproached
with
being
the
entire
cause
of
the
catastrophe
but
not
one
syllable
of
upbraiding
was
uttered
by
their
mother
though
the
tearful
eye
told
the
agony
within
in
the
afternoon
of
the
fifth
day
to
our
inexpressible
relief
some
of
the
men
returned
with
a
supply
of
that
fluid
of
which
we
had
never
before
felt
the
true
at
last
the
pleasure
of
meeting
and
greeting
sebituane
was
fulfilled
and
the
famous
chief
more
than
justified
all
expectations
he
met
the
party
on
the
chobe
river
and
conducted
them
with
great
ceremony
and
hospitality
to
his
home
the
way
seemed
to
be
opening
for
a
new
and
auspicious
missionary
settlement
when
in
a
few
days
sebituane
sickened
and
died
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
blows
which
livingstone
ever
experienced
its
tragic
suddenness
almost
stunned
him
looking
back
upon
it
now
it
is
easy
to
believe
that
it
was
not
god
s
will
that
livingstone
should
spend
his
life
in
the
work
of
a
missionary
settlement
but
should
be
driven
out
along
the
lonely
adventurous
path
where
his
destiny
lay
but
at
the
moment
he
only
felt
severely
the
crushing
of
his
hopes
and
frustration
of
his
plans
sebituane
s
daughter
who
succeeded
to
the
chieftainship
was
full
of
kindly
promises
but
difficulties
multiplied
in
the
way
of
a
settlement
which
further
exploration
of
the
district
did
not
diminish
penetrating
a
hundred
and
thirty
miles
to
the
north
oswell
and
livingstone
came
upon
the
broad
channel
of
a
noble
river
called
by
the
natives
the
seshéke
it
was
the
zambesi
and
some
three
hundred
yards
wide
even
there
more
than
a
thousand
miles
from
the
mouth
clearly
the
swamps
round
the
great
river
afforded
no
healthy
land
for
settling
there
must
be
more
exploration
done
and
meantime
his
wife
and
children
must
be
cared
for
they
were
hundreds
of
miles
from
any
white
settlement
even
so
livingstone
might
still
have
debated
his
destiny
but
revelations
came
to
him
that
the
slaver
was
even
now
establishing
his
accursed
hold
on
this
district
sebituane
s
people
the
makololo
finest
and
loyallest
of
tribesmen
had
begun
to
sell
children
plundered
from
their
native
villages
for
guns
and
calicoes
it
is
he
wrote
much
later
of
which
the
slaves
die
even
children
who
showed
wonderful
endurance
in
keeping
up
with
the
chained
gangs
would
sometimes
hear
the
sound
of
dancing
and
the
merry
tinkle
of
drums
in
passing
near
a
village
then
the
memory
of
home
and
happy
days
proved
too
much
for
them
they
cried
and
sobbed
the
broken
heart
came
on
and
they
rapidly
this
was
the
awful
revelation
that
came
to
livingstone
in
the
land
of
the
makololo
little
more
than
a
year
before
such
an
idea
as
the
barter
of
human
beings
for
guns
had
never
been
known
among
this
tribe
had
we
been
here
sooner
the
slave
traffic
would
never
have
existed
argued
livingstone
he
began
to
have
a
vision
of
christian
settlements
standing
sentinel
over
the
lives
and
happiness
of
the
natives
of
the
interior
if
the
slaver
could
make
his
way
from
the
coast
to
the
centre
so
could
the
missionary
it
was
the
one
effective
counterstroke
in
the
battle
for
human
liberty
but
it
meant
separation
from
wife
and
bairns
he
must
return
and
do
this
work
alone
he
could
risk
no
one
s
life
but
his
own
his
decision
was
taken
he
devotes
only
a
single
paragraph
to
the
long
and
arduous
journey
to
cape
town
it
was
a
matter
of
fifteen
hundred
miles
and
part
of
it
was
through
territory
where
a
caffre
war
was
being
waged
which
excited
livingstone
s
scorn
for
the
waste
of
blood
and
treasure
he
was
an
object
of
suspicion
at
the
cape
the
state
authorities
suspected
his
humanitarian
sympathies
and
the
church
officials
his
theological
orthodoxy
he
was
in
debt
and
had
anticipated
his
small
salary
for
more
than
a
year
in
advance
but
he
had
written
to
the
directors
of
the
london
missionary
society
in
the
most
resolute
terms
consider
the
multitudes
that
in
the
providence
of
god
have
been
brought
to
light
in
the
country
of
sebituane
the
probability
that
in
our
efforts
to
evangelise
we
shall
put
a
stop
to
the
slave
trade
in
a
large
region
and
by
means
of
the
highway
into
the
north
which
we
have
discovered
bring
unknown
nations
into
the
sympathies
of
the
christian
world
nothing
but
a
strong
conviction
that
the
step
will
lead
to
the
glory
of
christ
would
make
me
orphanise
my
children
should
you
not
feel
yourselves
justified
in
incurring
the
expense
of
their
support
in
england
i
shall
feel
called
upon
to
renounce
the
hope
of
carrying
the
gospel
into
that
country
but
stay
i
am
not
sure
so
powerfully
convinced
am
i
that
it
is
the
will
of
our
lord
that
i
should
go
i
will
go
no
matter
who
opposes
but
from
you
i
expect
nothing
but
a
happy
comment
on
this
letter
is
found
in
livingstone
s
missionary
travels
in
the
paragraph
recording
the
farewell
to
his
wife
and
children
having
placed
my
family
on
board
a
ship
and
promised
to
rejoin
them
in
two
years
we
parted
for
as
it
subsequently
proved
nearly
five
years
the
directors
of
the
london
missionary
society
signified
their
cordial
approval
of
my
project
by
leaving
the
matter
entirely
to
my
own
discretion
and
i
have
much
pleasure
in
acknowledging
my
obligations
to
the
gentlemen
composing
that
body
for
always
acting
in
an
enlightened
spirit
and
with
as
much
liberality
as
their
constitution
would
livingstone
started
back
for
the
interior
on
the
of
june
he
was
now
in
his
fortieth
year
chapter
iii
it
is
difficult
to
summarise
livingstone
s
achievements
during
the
eleven
years
he
had
spent
in
africa
he
had
penetrated
furthest
north
from
the
cape
of
any
white
man
he
had
discovered
lake
ngami
and
the
upper
reaches
of
the
zambesi
he
had
given
christianity
a
foothold
among
the
bakwains
and
the
makololo
he
had
converted
one
of
the
most
remarkable
chiefs
in
central
africa
he
had
built
three
houses
with
his
own
hands
and
had
taught
many
hundreds
to
read
he
had
exercised
the
healing
art
to
the
relief
and
benefit
of
thousands
he
had
made
some
progress
in
reducing
sechuana
to
a
grammatical
language
and
had
even
composed
hymns
in
it
he
had
made
invaluable
scientific
researches
and
had
enriched
our
knowledge
of
the
animalia
flora
and
fauna
of
central
africa
above
all
he
had
seen
at
first
hand
the
horrors
of
the
slave
traffic
and
had
vowed
himself
to
the
ultimate
prevention
of
this
form
of
man
s
inhumanity
to
eleven
busy
arduous
and
perilous
years
had
brought
him
to
midlife
he
was
now
about
to
dedicate
all
his
ripe
experience
and
unique
powers
of
head
and
heart
to
the
religious
and
social
redemption
of
the
dark
interior
of
the
continent
to
which
he
had
consecrated
his
life
even
during
his
brief
sojourn
at
the
cape
he
had
been
perfecting
himself
for
the
work
that
lay
before
him
he
had
studied
astronomy
and
had
learned
to
take
observations
under
sir
maclear
the
astronomer
royal
who
wrote
of
him
afterwards
what
that
man
has
done
is
unprecedented
you
could
go
to
any
point
across
the
entire
continent
along
livingstone
s
track
and
feel
certain
of
your
in
david
livingstone
s
judgment
it
was
impossible
for
a
man
to
be
too
thoroughly
equipped
for
the
great
business
of
a
missionary
in
one
respect
his
equipment
was
necessarily
poor
his
financial
resources
were
so
meagre
that
he
had
to
fall
back
on
very
lean
kine
to
draw
his
waggon
which
is
why
the
journey
to
kuruman
took
a
full
three
months
there
a
broken
wheel
detained
him
and
possibly
saved
his
life
for
this
was
the
time
selected
by
the
band
of
dutch
marauders
to
wreak
their
vengeance
on
him
and
on
the
hapless
tribe
of
sechele
it
is
a
shocking
story
and
in
his
sympathy
with
sechele
sixty
of
whose
people
had
been
massacred
livingstone
could
almost
forget
his
own
personal
loss
though
he
grieved
sorely
over
the
wanton
destruction
of
his
books
amid
all
his
sorrow
and
heartbreak
he
can
yet
smile
at
the
humorous
side
we
shall
move
more
easily
now
that
we
are
lightened
of
our
furniture
they
have
taken
away
our
sofa
i
never
had
a
good
rest
on
it
we
had
only
got
it
ready
when
we
left
well
they
can
t
have
taken
away
all
the
stones
we
shall
have
a
seat
in
spite
of
them
and
that
too
with
a
merry
heart
which
doeth
good
like
a
never
in
this
world
was
anyone
who
had
so
stout
a
philosophy
for
times
of
misfortune
he
could
jest
that
the
boers
had
saved
him
the
trouble
of
making
a
poor
sechele
in
his
despair
resolved
on
a
personal
appeal
for
justice
to
the
great
white
queen
and
actually
travelled
to
the
cape
to
take
ship
to
england
he
was
shown
much
kindness
there
and
eventually
returned
gathered
the
people
around
him
and
became
a
stronger
chief
than
before
while
he
continued
to
instruct
his
tribe
in
the
bible
without
any
assistance
from
a
missionary
there
are
few
more
striking
proofs
of
the
enduring
power
of
livingstone
s
personal
influence
and
christian
faith
the
journey
through
our
old
friend
the
desert
to
the
chobe
river
and
across
it
to
where
sekeletu
the
son
of
sebituane
was
now
reigning
was
more
arduous
and
perilous
than
it
had
been
previously
the
floods
from
the
annual
inundation
of
the
chobe
were
an
almost
invincible
obstacle
yet
where
the
waters
did
not
lie
the
heat
was
torrid
at
the
surface
of
the
ground
in
the
sun
the
thermometer
registered
the
hand
can
not
be
held
on
the
earth
and
even
the
horny
feet
of
the
natives
must
be
protected
by
sandals
of
the
battle
with
the
waters
of
the
chobe
and
its
tributaries
would
have
ended
in
the
defeat
of
anyone
less
than
this
traveller
many
of
the
natives
retired
from
the
encounter
on
the
easy
pretext
of
throwing
dice
and
declaring
that
the
gods
willed
their
return
some
of
them
feigned
sickness
to
ride
in
the
waggons
and
it
required
infinite
patience
and
humouring
to
get
them
forward
part
of
the
journey
lay
through
dense
forest
and
laborious
days
were
spent
swinging
the
axe
to
make
a
waggon
track
the
rivers
effectually
stopped
the
waggons
and
livingstone
took
to
a
pontoon
and
afterwards
to
canoes
but
there
was
much
wading
to
do
under
a
blistering
sun
and
through
reeds
that
made
our
hands
all
raw
and
bloody
and
thorns
that
tore
even
leather
trousers
they
were
glad
to
sleep
in
a
filthy
deserted
hut
and
at
night
the
cold
dews
descended
and
the
mosquitoes
gathered
in
clouds
they
were
disturbed
by
the
hippopotami
and
the
eerie
waters
were
alive
with
but
no
combination
of
perils
had
any
terror
for
one
the
alphabet
of
whose
creed
was
that
man
is
immortal
till
his
work
is
at
twilight
of
one
day
a
village
was
descried
on
the
river
bank
it
was
morémi
and
livingstone
had
reached
his
beloved
makololo
at
last
the
inhabitants
looked
like
people
who
had
seen
a
ghost
he
says
but
what
he
himself
really
looked
like
he
forbears
to
add
he
has
dropped
among
us
from
the
clouds
yet
came
riding
on
the
back
of
a
hippopotamus
this
was
their
appropriate
description
of
the
pontoon
we
makololo
thought
no
one
could
cross
the
chobe
without
our
knowledge
but
here
he
drops
among
us
like
a
they
returned
with
him
took
the
waggons
to
pieces
and
carried
them
across
on
a
number
of
canoes
lashed
on
the
of
may
they
reached
linyanti
the
capital
town
of
the
makololo
where
the
new
chief
sekeletu
received
them
in
royal
livingstone
s
problem
had
now
definitely
to
be
solved
sekeletu
was
not
a
whit
behind
sebituane
in
friendliness
and
not
much
inferior
in
intelligence
he
had
no
desire
for
the
bible
fearing
that
it
might
compel
him
to
content
himself
with
one
wife
but
he
set
an
example
to
the
tribe
in
reverent
attention
to
livingstone
s
simple
preaching
and
he
had
absolute
faith
in
the
protection
afforded
to
his
people
by
livingstone
s
presence
and
skill
but
exactly
a
week
after
the
arrival
at
linyanti
livingstone
had
his
first
taste
of
malaria
nor
did
the
efforts
of
the
native
doctors
do
much
to
cure
him
he
experienced
its
weakening
effect
if
he
looked
up
suddenly
he
was
affected
with
a
strange
giddiness
everything
appeared
to
rush
to
the
left
and
if
i
did
not
catch
hold
of
some
support
i
fell
heavily
on
the
the
same
horrible
sensations
occurred
at
night
whenever
i
turned
suddenly
one
thing
was
clear
linyanti
was
no
place
for
a
healthy
settlement
some
might
add
that
with
fever
in
the
system
it
was
idle
to
think
of
a
journey
of
a
thousand
miles
or
more
but
this
was
not
livingstone
s
way
of
looking
at
things
there
is
a
good
deal
in
not
giving
in
to
this
disease
he
writes
he
who
is
will
die
sooner
than
the
man
who
is
not
of
a
melancholic
ill
as
he
was
he
was
resolute
to
continue
his
explorations
and
with
sekeletu
and
a
large
band
of
makololo
for
companions
he
travelled
some
hundreds
of
miles
of
waterway
ascending
the
great
river
to
the
from
seshéke
here
the
zambesi
is
called
the
leeambye
and
livingstone
expresses
his
delight
at
skimming
along
in
great
canoes
gazing
on
a
wonderful
inland
river
which
no
white
man
had
hitherto
explored
he
finds
as
ever
in
the
wonders
and
beauties
of
nature
the
splendour
of
the
wild
birds
and
the
curious
fascination
of
the
some
relief
from
the
awful
spectacle
constantly
present
of
human
cruelty
and
degradation
the
sciences
he
writes
exhibit
such
wonderful
intelligence
and
design
in
all
their
various
ramifications
some
time
ought
to
be
devoted
to
them
before
engaging
in
missionary
work
we
may
feel
that
we
are
leaning
on
his
bosom
while
living
in
a
world
clothed
in
beauty
and
robed
with
the
glorious
perfection
of
its
maker
and
preserver
he
who
stays
his
mind
on
his
god
will
not
fret
himself
because
of
he
that
believeth
shall
not
make
it
was
indeed
well
for
him
that
he
had
this
power
to
absorb
himself
in
whatsoever
things
are
lovely
for
the
nightmare
of
heathenism
was
always
with
him
he
has
to
witness
sekeletu
s
revenge
on
those
who
had
plotted
against
him
some
of
the
scenes
are
incredibly
horrible
and
his
protests
are
unavailing
the
miseries
of
slavery
wrung
his
heart
and
as
he
advances
into
the
dark
interior
the
chorus
of
human
agonies
is
ever
in
his
ears
i
was
in
closer
contact
with
heathens
than
i
had
ever
been
before
and
though
all
were
as
kind
to
me
as
possible
yet
to
endure
the
dancing
roaring
and
singing
the
jesting
the
grumbling
quarrellings
and
murderings
of
these
children
of
nature
was
the
severest
penance
i
had
yet
undergone
in
the
course
of
my
missionary
again
he
exclaims
in
his
diary
the
more
intimately
i
become
acquainted
with
barbarians
the
more
disgusting
does
heathenism
become
it
is
inconceivably
vile
they
never
visit
anywhere
but
for
the
purpose
of
plunder
and
oppression
they
never
go
anywhere
but
with
a
club
or
spear
in
hand
they
need
a
healer
may
god
enable
me
to
be
such
to
slowly
but
surely
the
whole
tragedy
of
africa
is
unveiled
before
him
the
fair
landscape
of
its
rivers
and
forests
the
gay
plumage
of
its
birds
and
beauty
of
its
living
creatures
is
like
a
gorgeous
curtain
covering
unspeakable
depths
of
pain
and
sin
the
people
gather
in
hundreds
to
hear
him
and
especially
to
see
the
wonders
of
his
magic
lantern
but
he
can
not
in
a
brief
stay
undo
the
superstitions
and
inhumanities
of
centuries
his
eye
is
on
the
future
a
minister
who
has
not
seen
so
much
pioneer
service
as
i
have
done
would
have
been
shocked
to
see
so
little
effect
produced
we
can
afford
to
work
in
faith
future
missionaries
will
be
rewarded
by
conversions
for
every
sermon
we
are
their
pioneers
they
will
doubtless
have
more
light
than
we
but
we
served
our
master
earnestly
and
proclaimed
the
gospel
they
will
baffled
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
healthy
situation
for
a
permanent
mission
station
near
linyanti
the
final
determination
to
make
a
way
to
the
coast
crystallised
in
his
mind
i
shall
open
up
a
path
to
the
interior
or
perish
he
writes
in
his
terse
decisive
way
to
moffat
i
never
have
had
the
shadow
of
a
shade
of
doubt
as
to
the
propriety
of
my
on
november
he
writes
home
to
his
father
what
he
evidently
feels
may
be
his
last
will
and
testament
may
god
in
mercy
permit
me
to
do
something
for
the
cause
of
christ
in
these
dark
places
of
the
earth
may
he
accept
my
children
for
his
service
and
sanctify
them
for
it
my
blessing
on
my
wife
may
god
comfort
her
if
my

comes
back
after

all
the

relieved
him
of
the
necessity
of

had

the
chancellor
of

would
not
have
made
much
out
of
the
death
duties
on
this
property
chapter
iv
before
we
begin
our
journey
with
livingstone
to
the
coast
it
will
be
well
to
pause
and
consider
two
things
firstly
the
task
proposed
and
secondly
the
equipment
for
the
task
the
task
linyanti
lies
a
hundred
miles
from
the
zambesi
river
at
which
the
two
possible
routes
may
be
said
to
fork
the
one
eastward
was
comparatively
simple
it
was
to
follow
the
great
river
some
thousand
miles
to
the
sea
the
other
westward
meant
tracing
the
river
towards
the
source
so
far
as
was
possible
and
then
striking
westward
for
paul
de
loanda
a
matter
in
all
of
some
fifteen
hundred
miles
cape
town
lay
to
the
south
another
fifteen
hundred
miles
these
were
the
three
spokes
of
the
wheel
from
the
centre
at
linyanti
little
was
known
to
livingstone
of
either
the
eastward
or
the
westward
route
he
could
only
roughly
estimate
the
distance
he
had
no
notion
what
hostile
tribes
what
malarial
swamps
what
impenetrable
forests
what
waterless
deserts
might
fall
to
be
encountered
all
that
lay
in
the
lap
of
destiny
he
had
not
only
to
make
this
pilgrimage
himself
he
had
to
watch
over
the
safety
of
his
makololo
boys
keep
them
supplied
with
food
and
drink
and
protect
them
in
the
event
of
attack
by
savages
the
deadly
tsetse
fly
lay
in
wait
for
his
oxen
the
african
fever
lurked
in
ambush
everywhere
in
all
times
of
extremity
he
had
nothing
to
consult
but
his
own
stout
heart
and
resourceful
brain
perils
of
floods
and
fevers
wild
beasts
and
wilder
human
foes
might
be
expected
as
a
daily
portion
death
would
be
almost
a
familiar
companion
no
love
of
adventure
no
curiosity
and
fascination
of
exploration
would
have
driven
livingstone
through
this
task
one
has
only
to
study
his
journal
and
listen
to
his
simple
artless
confessions
of
faith
to
see
that
at
every
step
the
christian
motive
was
supreme
he
had
sight
of
the
ultimate
city
the
coming
civilisation
of
christ
and
the
lions
of
the
way
were
all
chained
and
the
dangerous
rapids
charmed
the
equipment
for
the
task
never
was
a
journey
of
such
heroic
proportions
undertaken
with
so
simple
an
equipment
when
one
reads
of
the
elaborate
preparations
for
modern
expeditions
not
half
so
formidable
one
is
amazed
at
the
contrast
many
of
my
readers
have
probably
seen
the
four
tin
canisters
fifteen
inches
square
that
held
the
valuables
one
contained
spare
shirts
trousers
and
shoes
to
be
used
when
civilisation
was
reached
one
was
a
medicine
chest
one
a
library
one
held
the
magic
lantern
by
means
of
which
the
gospel
story
was
to
be
preached
for
the
rest
there
were
twenty
pounds
of
beads
value
forty
shillings
a
few
biscuits
a
few
pounds
of
tea
and
sugar
and
about
twenty
pounds
of
coffee
there
were
five
guns
in
all
three
muskets
for
the
natives
who
could
use
them
and
who
only
hit
things
by
accident
a
rifle
and
shot
gun
for
livingstone
whose
injured
arm
always
made
shooting
difficult
and
whose
frame
sometimes
made
it
impossible
a
bag
of
clothes
for
the
journey
a
small
tent
a
sheepskin
mantle
and
a
to
sleep
on
completed
this
equipment
the
sextant
and
other
instruments
were
carried
separately
and
the
ammunition
was
distributed
through
the
luggage
so
that
if
any
portion
were
lost
some
powder
and
shot
would
remain
to
them
boys
were
chosen
for
the
westward
journey
and
it
is
as
well
to
set
down
the
fact
here
that
all
the
were
brought
back
in
safety
to
their
homes
the
expedition
left
linyanti
on
the
of
november
away
in
europe
the
english
and
french
fleets
had
entered
the
bosphorus
and
a
delirious
public
opinion
was
hurrying
great
britain
into
the
blunders
of
the
crimean
war
far
away
from
all
the
of
european
politics
one
christian
hero
was
setting
his
heart
on
the
more
renowned
victories
of
peace
and
freedom
with
nothing
to
sustain
him
but
his
own
quenchless
faith
in
god
and
the
right
even
at
the
start
he
had
been
severely
shaken
with
fever
and
much
preaching
had
brought
back
an
old
troublesome
complaint
in
the
throat
but
these
were
personal
inconveniences
which
he
never
allowed
to
deter
him
from
any
line
of
duty
the
farewells
were
said
with
sekeletu
at
seshéke
on
the
zambesi
and
the
expedition
passed
away
to
the
into
the
great
unknown
for
the
particulars
of
livingstone
s
memorable
journeys
we
are
dependent
on
what
he
called
his
lined
it
was
a
strongly
bound
quarto
volume
of
more
than
eight
hundred
pages
and
fitted
with
lock
and
key
the
writing
in
it
is
extraordinarily
neat
and
clear
but
there
are
pathetic
pages
in
it
when
it
is
evident
that
the
writer
is
shaking
with
fever
yet
nevertheless
his
iron
will
is
compelling
his
trembling
fingers
to
do
their
office
everything
went
down
in
his
journal
blaikie
well
says
that
it
is
built
up
in
a
there
are
frequent
prayers
and
poignant
religious
reflections
the
ejaculations
of
a
heart
charged
to
overflowing
with
the
divine
love
and
human
compassion
immediately
following
will
be
scientific
observations
or
speculations
on
some
problem
of
natural
history
or
geological
structure
the
various
incidents
in
the
journey
are
all
recorded
with
the
simplicity
and
freedom
from
sensationalism
of
the
evangelist
mark
livingstone
never
magnifies
a
peril
and
dwells
not
at
all
on
his
personal
heroism
the
lined
journal
ranks
as
one
of
his
books
and
its
companions
in
the
little
canister
were
only
a
sechuana
pentateuch
thomson
s
tables
a
nautical
almanac
and
a
bible
he
confesses
that
the
want
of
other
mental
pabulum
is
felt
a
misfortune
little
short
of
a
disaster
befel
him
at
the
beginning
of
this
journey
the
greater
part
of
his
medicines
were
stolen
with
the
health
of
all
his
escort
to
see
to
and
with
fever
racking
his
own
frame
it
must
have
seemed
as
if
the
chances
of
success
were
sensibly
diminished
it
is
interesting
to
compare
livingstone
s
rate
of
progress
with
that
of
ordinary
traders
the
trader
thought
seven
miles
a
day
good
travelling
and
even
so
he
only
reckoned
on
travelling
ten
days
a
month
seventy
miles
a
month
was
in
his
eye
satisfactory
progress
livingstone
struck
an
average
of
ten
miles
a
day
and
travelled
about
twenty
days
a
month
thus
he
seldom
made
less
than
two
hundred
miles
a
month
he
travelled
from
linyanti
to
loanda
some
miles
in
six
months
and
a
half
which
as
a
mere
feat
of
rapid
african
transit
was
quite
amazing
on
this
journey
he
rode
hundreds
of
miles
on
the
back
of
his
sindbad
whose
temper
was
uncertain
and
whose
idiosyncrasies
were
pronounced
we
shall
see
as
we
proceed
that
sindbad
was
by
no
means
always
a
satisfactory
colleague
complications
that
might
have
led
to
ugly
developments
occurred
while
they
were
still
in
sekeletu
s
sphere
of
influence
and
among
his
people
it
was
discovered
that
a
party
of
makololo
had
made
a
foray
to
the
north
and
had
destroyed
some
of
the
villages
of
the
balonda
through
whose
country
they
were
bound
to
pass
some
of
the
villagers
had
been
seized
for
slaves
and
livingstone
foresaw
reprisals
and
the
probability
that
prejudice
would
be
excited
against
himself
and
his
men
he
therefore
insisted
that
the
captives
should
be
restored
as
a
means
of
demonstrating
that
his
errand
was
one
of
friendliness
and
peace
this
act
helped
to
disarm
the
hostility
of
the
balonda
chief
and
livingstone
afterwards
busied
himself
to
form
a
commercial
alliance
between
the
balonda
and
the
makololo
it
was
always
his
policy
to
overcome
the
jealousies
and
hostilities
of
rival
tribes
and
substitute
confidence
based
on
mutual
interest
after
leaving
the
country
of
the
makololo
and
while
ascending
the
barotse
valley
the
rains
were
almost
incessant
and
the
expedition
moved
forward
through
clouds
of
vapour
that
hardly
ever
lifted
for
a
whole
fortnight
at
a
time
neither
sun
nor
moon
was
seen
sufficiently
to
get
an
observation
for
latitude
and
longitude
the
very
tent
that
sheltered
him
by
night
began
to
rot
with
the
excessive
and
incessant
humidity
in
spite
of
being
kept
well
oiled
the
guns
grew
rusty
and
the
clothing
of
the
party
became
mouldy
and
part
of
the
way
lay
through
dense
forest
and
the
axe
had
continually
to
be
plied
the
waters
of
the
river
were
crowded
with
hippopotami
alligators
and
at
times
with
fish
but
it
was
not
easy
to
get
food
in
the
forest
and
repeatedly
they
were
reduced
to
living
on
such
roots
as
could
be
trusted
while
moles
and
mice
became
a
luxury
they
were
making
now
for
the
country
of
the
great
chief
shinté
whose
fame
had
travelled
far
and
early
in
the
new
year
of
found
them
at
his
capital
the
most
imposing
town
that
livingstone
had
seen
in
central
africa
in
the
town
were
two
portuguese
who
were
trading
for
slaves
and
ivory
they
had
a
gang
of
young
female
slaves
in
a
chain
hoeing
the
ground
in
front
of
their
this
was
the
first
time
that
livingstone
s
barotse
companions
had
seen
slaves
in
chains
they
are
not
men
they
exclaimed
meaning
they
are
beasts
who
treat
their
children
the
explorer
was
received
with
great
ceremony
shinté
sat
on
a
sort
of
throne
covered
with
a
leopard
s
skin
under
a
banyan
tree
he
must
have
presented
a
somewhat
bizarre
appearance
for
livingstone
tells
us
he
had
on
a
checked
jacket
and
a
kilt
of
scarlet
baize
edged
with
green
strings
of
beads
copper
armlets
and
bracelets
hung
about
his
neck
and
limbs
for
crown
he
had
a
great
helmet
made
of
beads
and
surmounted
with
a
huge
bunch
of
goose
feathers
the
subsequent
ceremony
was
as
odd
and
elaborate
as
the
chief
s
wardrobe
there
were
terrifying
manœuvres
of
savage
soldiers
armed
to
the
teeth
livingstone
suspected
that
their
object
was
to
cause
him
and
his
friends
to
take
to
their
heels
but
if
so
it
was
a
failure
at
last
the
were
presented
to
the
chief
by
the
orator
sambanza
who
described
livingstone
s
exploits
in
great
style
dwelt
on
the
fact
that
he
had
brought
back
the
captives
taken
by
the
makololo
that
he
possessed
the
word
from
heaven
that
he
sought
the
peace
of
all
the
tribes
and
was
opening
up
a
path
for
trade
this
speech
was
a
great
effort
and
its
effect
was
by
no
means
minimised
that
the
orator
wore
a
cloth
so
long
that
a
boy
carried
it
after
him
as
a
it
would
appear
that
fashionable
habits
are
the
same
all
the
world
over
during
his
stay
at
shinté
s
court
livingstone
suffered
agonies
from
fever
accompanied
by
violent
action
of
the
but
he
made
his
own
invariable
impression
upon
the
chief
by
his
frankness
independence
and
courtesy
he
preached
to
the
assembled
tribesmen
and
showed
the
pictures
and
he
pleaded
urgently
with
shinté
personally
against
the
growing
practice
of
slavery
when
his
stay
was
over
shinté
gave
him
the
last
evidence
of
goodwill
for
he
drew
from
out
his
clothing
a
string
of
beads
and
the
end
of
a
conical
shell
which
is
considered
in
regions
far
from
the
sea
of
as
great
value
as
the
lord
mayor
s
badge
is
in
london
he
hung
it
round
my
neck
and
said
there
now
you
a
proof
of
my
shinté
also
bequeathed
to
the
expedition
his
principal
guide
mtemése
illustration
preaching
on
the
journey
who
he
promised
would
conduct
them
to
the
sea
mtemése
proved
to
be
by
no
means
an
immaculate
person
among
other
delinquencies
he
left
the
pontoon
behind
a
loss
that
was
keenly
felt
he
had
too
a
prejudice
against
speedy
travel
which
livingstone
could
not
be
induced
to
share
he
was
useful
however
in
levying
tribute
of
food
throughout
shinté
s
dominion
and
evidently
thought
livingstone
a
great
fool
for
paying
a
fair
price
for
what
could
have
been
had
for
nothing
gradually
shinté
s
territory
was
left
behind
and
that
of
katema
was
invaded
it
seemed
to
livingstone
that
as
they
moved
north
the
moral
conditions
darkened
at
times
the
great
horror
of
heathenism
laid
hold
of
him
everywhere
was
the
same
unrelieved
tragedy
of
brutality
and
murder
sometimes
over
the
camp
fires
his
savage
hosts
would
exult
in
their
customs
they
told
of
the
death
of
chiefs
and
the
slaughter
of
enough
of
their
subjects
to
be
an
escort
to
the
nether
world
the
further
north
livingstone
penetrated
the
more
bloodily
superstitious
did
the
people
become
yet
he
must
eat
with
them
chat
with
them
laugh
with
them
and
the
impression
of
such
religious
teaching
as
he
could
impart
was
alas
so
superficial
katema
proved
peaceable
but
his
people
lived
under
the
perpetual
shadow
of
the
and
would
gladly
have
been
taken
away
to
the
makololo
country
the
beginning
of
march
found
them
for
the
first
time
in
hostile
territory
there
had
been
much
rain
and
flood
wading
and
swimming
livingstone
himself
had
had
an
adventure
that
thoroughly
alarmed
his
men
and
served
to
evoke
their
real
devotion
he
was
flung
from
his
ox
in
midstream
and
compelled
to
strike
out
for
the
opposite
bank
there
was
a
simultaneous
rush
on
the
part
of
all
his
men
to
rescue
him
their
delight
was
unbounded
when
they
found
he
could
swim
like
themselves
who
carried
the
white
man
across
the
river
but
himself
they
said
afterwards
it
was
among
the
chiboques
that
the
expedition
came
nearest
to
having
to
fight
for
their
lives
and
bloodshed
was
only
averted
by
livingstone
s
wonderful
patience
and
fearlessness
he
sat
on
a
campstool
with
his
gun
across
his
knees
and
insisted
on
arguing
with
the
chief
who
was
endeavouring
to
levy
blackmail
it
was
characteristic
of
livingstone
that
he
argued
the
legitimacy
of
passing
through
their
country
on
the
ground
that
the
land
belonged
to
god
if
their
gardens
had
been
damaged
compensation
would
have
been
paid
but
the
earth
is
the
lord
s
they
did
not
attempt
to
controvert
this
he
comments
because
it
is
in
accordance
with
their
own
finally
he
told
them
that
if
there
was
to
be
a
fight
they
must
begin
it
and
the
guilt
be
on
their
heads
matters
looked
critical
for
some
hours
but
livingstone
s
tact
prevailed
and
the
gift
of
an
ox
satisfied
them
for
the
time
being
they
had
more
trouble
later
before
getting
quit
of
the
chiboques
but
there
was
no
actual
outbreak
there
was
thieving
however
of
their
goods
which
were
getting
sadly
reduced
and
the
attitude
of
enmity
and
treachery
added
to
the
gloom
of
a
very
gloomy
forest
through
which
a
way
had
to
be
found
so
thick
was
the
atmosphere
that
the
hanging
creepers
could
not
be
seen
and
again
and
again
the
riders
were
swept
off
the
backs
of
the
oxen
on
one
occasion
sindbad
went
off
at
a
plunging
gallop
the
bridle
broke
and
livingstone
came
down
backwards
on
the
crown
of
his
head
at
the
same
time
sindbad
completed
the
triumph
by
dealing
him
a
kick
on
the
thigh
livingstone
makes
light
of
all
this
only
remarking
that
he
does
not
recommend
it
as
a
palliative
for
repeated
attacks
of
fever
had
reduced
him
to
a
skeleton
the
sodden
blanket
which
served
as
a
saddle
caused
abrasions
and
sores
his
projecting
bones
were
chafed
on
the
hard
bed
at
nights
he
had
enough
burdens
to
bear
without
having
to
dare
the
threats
of
savages
at
the
last
outpost
of
the
chiboque
country
their
two
guides
turned
traitors
and
thieves
and
escaped
with
the
larger
portion
of
their
beads
so
necessary
for
barter
this
was
almost
the
last
straw
and
there
was
mutiny
among
livingstone
s
men
for
they
declared
they
would
go
home
he
was
in
despair
and
having
finally
told
them
that
in
that
case
he
would
go
on
alone
he
went
into
his
little
tent
and
flung
himself
upon
his
knees
with
the
mind
directed
to
him
who
hears
the
sighing
of
the
presently
one
of
the
men
crept
into
the
tent
we
will
never
leave
you
he
said
do
not
be
disheartened
wherever
you
lead
we
will
the
others
took
up
the
chorus
they
were
all
his
children
they
told
him
and
they
would
die
for
him
they
had
only
spoken
in
the
bitterness
of
their
feeling
and
because
they
felt
they
could
do
nothing
they
had
one
more
parley
with
a
bullying
chief
but
came
out
victorious
thanks
to
the
opportune
appearance
of
a
young
military
portuguese
who
afterwards
showed
them
every
hospitality
moreover
they
were
now
able
to
dispose
of
certain
tusks
of
ivory
presented
to
them
by
sekeletu
the
proceeds
of
which
clothed
the
whole
party
and
partially
armed
them
the
journey
was
easy
now
save
that
the
intrepid
leader
had
had
attacks
of
fever
and
suffered
one
more
humiliation
at
the
hands
of
sindbad
being
compelled
inadvertently
to
bathe
in
the
lombé
he
had
to
reassure
his
men
as
they
drew
near
to
the
atlantic
for
they
began
to
be
troubled
lest
after
all
he
should
leave
them
to
the
cruel
mercies
of
other
white
men
nothing
will
happen
to
you
but
what
happens
to
me
he
told
them
we
have
stood
by
one
another
hitherto
and
will
do
so
till
the
in
course
of
time
they
crossed
the
sterile
plains
near
loanda
and
gazed
upon
the
sea
we
marched
along
with
our
father
they
said
afterwards
believing
that
what
the
ancients
had
always
told
us
was
true
that
the
world
has
no
end
but
all
at
once
the
world
said
to
us
i
am
finished
there
is
no
more
of
it
was
a
weak
worn
haggard
figure
that
on
the
may
entered
the
city
of
loanda
labouring
under
great
depression
of
the
fever
had
brought
on
chronic
dysentery
he
could
not
sit
on
his
ox
ten
minutes
at
a
time
his
mind
was
depressed
by
disease
and
his
heart
misgave
him
as
to
his
welcome
but
he
had
finished
his
course
he
had
accomplished
his
superhuman
task
he
had
reached
the
coast
he
had
protected
and
guided
his
faithful
company
he
had
robbed
no
man
s
goods
and
taken
no
man
s
life
and
all
the
fourteen
hundred
miles
he
had
preached
the
gospel
and
argued
for
freedom
and
peace
chapter
v
livingstone
found
loanda
a
very
decayed
town
but
he
did
not
fail
to
win
many
friendships
gabriel
the
one
englishman
in
the
place
was
overwhelmingly
kind
and
the
roman
catholic
bishop
scarcely
less
so
english
were
in
the
harbour
also
keeping
both
eyes
open
for
slave
ships
and
livingstone
was
able
to
take
his
men
on
board
and
show
them
the
cannon
with
which
england
was
going
to
destroy
the
slave
he
himself
recovered
only
very
slowly
from
his
condition
of
absolute
emaciation
and
in
august
had
a
severe
relapse
which
left
him
a
mere
skeleton
everybody
was
kind
to
him
physicking
him
and
nourishing
him
and
what
was
most
of
all
valuable
in
his
depression
providing
him
with
lively
and
interesting
company
he
fell
in
with
their
plans
for
him
very
gratefully
but
on
one
point
he
was
adamant
they
had
wished
to
persuade
him
to
go
home
and
rest
the
british
captains
offered
him
a
passage
to
helena
when
this
failed
they
urged
him
to
take
the
the
forerunner
by
which
all
his
own
precious
diaries
and
letters
and
scientific
papers
with
maps
and
so
forth
were
to
be
sent
despite
his
weakness
it
was
not
in
him
to
be
idle
and
he
had
laboriously
accomplished
the
writing
of
this
big
budget
of
despatches
in
time
for
the
on
april
he
had
told
his
wife
that
he
would
rejoin
her
in
two
years
it
was
now
august
and
his
heart
cried
out
for
wife
and
children
but
one
thing
stood
in
the
way
he
had
promised
his
boys
to
take
them
back
to
their
own
country
and
they
were
there
in
loanda
on
the
faith
of
livingstone
s
word
it
did
not
consist
with
his
sense
of
honour
to
leave
them
at
loanda
while
he
went
home
for
a
holiday
and
he
refused
all
the
tempting
offers
the
reward
of
honourable
men
does
not
always
come
as
it
came
to
him
the
forerunner
went
down
with
all
hands
but
one
and
he
escaped
an
almost
certain
fate
because
he
kept
his
promise
but
alas
all
his
precious
papers
the
fruit
of
so
much
labour
were
destroyed
and
he
had
to
take
up
the
drudgery
of
doing
everything
over
again
it
was
the
form
of
toil
most
irksome
to
him
but
he
just
turned
to
and
did
it
it
was
his
way
fortunately
he
had
not
gone
far
on
the
homeward
track
when
this
news
reached
him
and
there
was
no
lack
of
hospitality
he
was
making
a
circuit
round
about
loanda
to
visit
some
of
the
more
noted
portuguese
settlements
and
estates
always
with
an
eye
to
the
better
cultivation
of
the
country
and
the
interest
of
inland
trade
the
of
his
papers
involved
long
and
tedious
delay
and
there
was
more
trouble
through
fever
among
his
men
the
year
of
dawned
before
he
left
a
hospitable
portuguese
home
and
struck
out
along
the
old
trail
it
is
worth
while
to
remember
here
that
whereas
the
expedition
travelled
from
linyanti
to
loanda
in
six
and
a
half
months
it
took
twice
that
time
to
return
it
was
september
before
they
saw
linyanti
again
the
homeward
journey
was
not
devoid
of
incident
and
excitement
the
passage
through
the
chiboque
territory
was
once
again
troublesome
just
when
livingstone
was
most
anxious
to
be
himself
he
fell
a
victim
to
rheumatic
fever
for
eight
days
he
lay
in
his
tent
tossing
and
groaning
with
pain
and
it
was
twenty
days
before
he
began
to
recover
and
the
old
ambition
to
be
on
the
march
came
back
to
him
his
men
objected
for
he
was
too
weak
to
move
and
at
the
physical
crisis
a
quarrel
broke
out
between
his
men
and
some
of
the
chiboques
a
blow
was
struck
for
which
ample
compensation
was
paid
but
with
the
leader
on
his
back
the
importunities
of
the
tribesmen
increased
and
matters
became
threatening
when
a
forward
move
was
made
an
organised
attack
on
the
baggage
took
place
and
shots
were
even
fired
though
nobody
was
hurt
it
was
then
that
livingstone
snatched
up
his
revolver
and
staggered
along
the
path
till
most
opportunely
he
encountered
the
hostile
chief
the
sight
of
the
six
barrels
gaping
into
his
stomach
and
my
own
ghastly
visage
looking
daggers
at
his
face
seemed
to
produce
an
instant
revolution
in
his
martial
he
suddenly
became
the
most
peaceable
man
in
all
africa
and
protested
his
goodwill
livingstone
advised
a
practical
illustration
of
this
and
bade
him
go
home
the
chief
explained
that
he
would
do
so
only
he
was
afraid
of
being
shot
in
the
back
if
i
wanted
to
kill
you
rejoined
livingstone
i
could
shoot
you
in
the
face
as
one
of
his
men
afraid
for
livingstone
s
own
safety
advised
him
not
to
give
the
chief
a
chance
of
shooting
him
in
the
back
whereupon
livingstone
retorted
tell
him
to
observe
that
i
am
not
afraid
of
him
and
mounting
his
ox
rode
away
triumphantly
plodding
steadily
onward
they
arrived
on
the
june
at
a
spot
famous
for
one
of
livingstone
s
most
notable
geographical
discoveries
which
he
afterwards
learned
was
actual
confirmation
of
sir
roderick
murchison
s
theory
which
the
latter
had
worked
out
in
his
own
as
the
only
one
that
would
satisfy
what
was
known
of
the
african
river
systems
and
the
geological
formation
livingstone
had
just
forded
a
wide
river
called
the
lotembwa
only
three
feet
deep
and
had
failed
to
remark
in
which
direction
it
was
flowing
he
believed
it
to
be
the
same
river
that
flowed
south
from
lake
dilolo
but
a
chief
pointed
out
to
him
that
this
was
not
so
for
the
former
river
flowed
north
into
the
kasai
one
of
the
main
tributaries
of
the
congo
the
latter
flowed
south
into
the
zambesi
livingstone
now
realised
that
he
was
standing
on
the
central
ridge
that
divided
these
two
systems
and
what
amazed
him
most
was
that
these
vast
river
systems
had
their
rise
not
in
a
chain
of
lofty
mountains
but
on
flat
plains
not
more
than
feet
above
the
sea
the
expedition
now
made
slow
and
peaceful
progress
along
their
former
route
being
welcomed
everywhere
by
their
old
friends
with
demonstrations
of
joy
and
astonishment
they
distributed
presents
to
all
who
had
prospered
them
on
their
way
and
left
none
but
friendly
memories
behind
them
when
at
the
end
of
july
they
reached
libonta
their
progress
became
a
triumphal
procession
his
men
arrayed
themselves
in
white
european
clothing
swaggered
like
soldiers
and
called
themselves
his
during
the
time
of
service
they
sat
with
their
guns
over
their
shoulders
you
have
opened
a
path
for
us
said
the
people
and
we
shall
have
the
ovations
continued
all
down
the
barotse
valley
there
were
no
drawbacks
except
that
many
of
the
men
found
that
during
their
absence
some
of
their
wives
had
sought
and
found
other
husbands
livingstone
advised
them
to
console
themselves
with
those
that
remained
even
so
you
have
as
many
as
i
have
he
reminded
them
at
linyanti
livingstone
found
his
waggon
and
belongings
perfectly
safe
and
some
stores
and
a
letter
a
year
old
from
and
moffat
sekeletu
s
gratification
knew
no
bounds
a
grand
new
uniform
had
been
sent
him
as
a
present
from
the
coast
and
when
he
wore
it
to
church
on
sunday
it
produced
a
greater
impression
than
the
sermon
it
is
worth
remarking
that
sekeletu
at
once
began
to
set
on
foot
a
trade
in
ivory
with
the
portuguese
at
the
coast
in
fulfilment
of
livingstone
s
policy
for
eight
weeks
livingstone
remained
at
linyanti
he
found
plenty
to
occupy
him
he
was
once
again
the
guide
philosopher
and
friend
to
all
the
tribe
he
had
doctoring
to
do
and
operations
to
perform
he
found
personal
interviews
on
religious
subjects
more
satisfactory
than
the
public
services
and
he
was
now
as
ever
supremely
anxious
that
these
people
should
owe
their
souls
to
his
ministry
he
had
letters
to
write
and
journals
to
transcribe
and
new
observations
to
make
he
had
all
the
odd
jobs
to
do
that
had
accumulated
during
his
absence
he
found
sekeletu
a
willing
pupil
in
his
ideas
on
commerce
and
on
the
removal
of
the
tribe
to
the
healthier
and
wealthier
barotse
valley
especially
he
had
to
think
out
the
problem
of
his
next
great
adventure
to
the
east
coast
his
inclination
decidedly
was
to
trace
the
course
of
the
zambesi
to
quilimane
and
the
sea
but
against
this
was
to
be
set
the
fact
that
it
had
an
evil
reputation
for
the
savagery
of
some
of
the
tribes
along
the
banks
certain
arabs
whom
he
had
met
had
strongly
counselled
him
to
strike
up
country
to
the
and
make
for
zanzibar
by
the
south
of
lake
tanganyika
the
tribes
were
reported
to
be
peaceable
and
the
villages
and
food
supplies
plentiful
if
he
decided
to
explore
the
zambesi
the
problem
of
the
north
or
south
shore
was
an
important
one
the
north
shore
was
reported
to
be
very
rocky
and
broken
and
consequently
specially
difficult
for
transport
either
shore
was
likely
to
be
dangerous
to
the
oxen
on
account
of
tsetse
fly
all
these
considerations
had
to
be
weighed
and
the
final
decision
was
to
risk
the
dangers
of
the
tribes
along
the
zambesi
and
to
take
the
north
shore
because
on
livingstone
s
map
tette
the
farthest
inland
station
of
the
portuguese
was
marked
as
being
on
the
north
of
the
river
this
turned
out
to
be
untrue
having
settled
his
course
he
made
his
preparations
sekeletu
proved
himself
a
most
magnificent
ally
livingstone
s
new
escort
was
composed
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
men
with
ten
slaughter
oxen
and
three
of
the
best
riding
oxen
he
was
provided
with
stores
of
food
and
given
tribute
rights
over
all
tribes
subject
to
sekeletu
when
we
consider
that
livingstone
had
no
one
to
finance
him
and
that
the
success
of
his
travels
depended
on
the
goodwill
of
native
chiefs
like
sekeletu
we
begin
to
understand
the
unique
influence
which
he
exercised
over
the
native
mind
those
who
knew
him
never
failed
him
at
a
pinch
they
never
deserted
him
in
his
need
they
lent
their
best
aid
to
carry
through
his
enterprises
and
gave
him
every
tangible
proof
that
can
be
given
from
one
man
to
another
of
confidence
honour
and
love
perhaps
before
we
set
out
on
this
new
journey
we
may
quote
from
livingstone
himself
two
passages
illustrative
of
the
secret
of
his
influence
in
the
first
he
says
no
one
ever
gains
much
influence
in
this
country
without
purity
and
uprightness
the
acts
of
a
stranger
are
keenly
scrutinised
by
both
old
and
young
and
seldom
is
the
judgment
pronounced
even
by
a
heathen
unfair
or
uncharitable
i
have
heard
women
speaking
in
admiration
of
a
white
man
because
he
was
pure
and
never
was
guilty
of
any
secret
immorality
had
he
been
they
would
have
known
it
and
untutored
heathen
though
they
be
would
have
despised
him
in
this
illustrates
livingstone
s
favourite
doctrine
that
it
is
the
missionary
s
life
that
is
the
most
powerful
sermon
that
his
teaching
was
partially
understood
may
be
gathered
from
the
story
of
mamire
sekeletu
s
stepfather
who
on
coming
to
say
used
words
like
these
you
are
now
going
among
people
who
can
not
be
trusted
because
we
have
used
them
badly
but
you
go
with
a
different
message
from
any
they
ever
heard
before
and
jesus
will
be
with
you
and
help
you
though
among
it
was
a
gracious
and
discerning
the
route
selected
led
livingstone
across
what
we
know
as
rhodesia
and
which
would
have
been
much
more
appropriately
named
livingstonia
it
passed
to
the
north
of
the
land
inhabited
by
the
formidable
and
dreaded
matabele
the
tribes
bordering
on
the
makololo
country
had
no
reason
to
love
their
oppressive
neighbours
and
this
fact
had
inspired
the
fears
expressed
in
mamire
s
words
it
was
on
the
of
november
that
the
final
departure
from
linyanti
was
made
and
sekeletu
accompanied
the
expedition
along
the
first
stage
he
took
the
opportunity
of
showing
livingstone
an
extraordinary
kindness
for
the
journey
began
in
a
terrific
tropical
thunderstorm
livingstone
s
clothing
had
gone
on
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
sleep
on
the
cold
ground
sekeletu
however
took
his
own
blanket
and
wrapped
it
about
the
missionary
lying
himself
uncovered
through
the
chill
night
i
was
much
affected
writes
livingstone
by
this
little
act
of
genuine
kindness
if
such
men
must
perish
by
the
advance
of
civilisation
as
certain
races
of
animals
do
before
others
it
is
a
it
was
no
great
distance
to
the
famous
falls
the
rumour
of
which
had
often
reached
livingstone
and
which
he
was
the
first
white
man
to
visit
the
falls
were
originally
called
shongwe
sebituane
used
to
ask
livingstone
whether
in
his
own
country
he
had
smoke
that
sounds
referring
to
the
pillars
of
vapour
and
the
roar
of
the
river
as
it
plunged
into
the
chasm
beneath
sliding
down
the
river
in
their
canoes
they
came
to
within
half
a
mile
of
the
falls
when
some
of
the
natives
who
were
expert
in
the
management
of
the
rapids
transferred
livingstone
to
a
lighter
canoe
and
with
practised
dexterity
guided
it
to
the
central
island
the
goat
island
of
the
zambesi
falls
on
the
edge
of
the
lip
over
which
the
water
this
adventure
can
only
be
made
when
the
river
is
low
but
it
was
successfully
accomplished
and
livingstone
was
able
to
gaze
down
into
the
fissure
into
which
the
great
river
plunges
and
apparently
disappears
then
he
saw
that
a
stream
of
a
thousand
yards
broad
leaped
down
a
hundred
feet
and
then
became
suddenly
compressed
into
a
space
of
fifteen
or
twenty
he
spent
many
hours
contemplating
its
beauties
noting
all
its
fascinations
and
pondering
the
scientific
problem
of
its
origin
he
then
permitted
himself
the
only
act
of
nationalism
personal
vanity
he
used
to
call
it
that
he
ever
indulged
in
he
changed
the
native
name
to
that
of
the
victoria
falls
in
honour
of
the
great
white
queen
and
returning
to
the
island
next
day
with
sekeletu
he
carved
his
initials
and
the
date
on
a
tree
and
planted
about
a
hundred
peach
and
apricot
stones
and
a
quantity
of
with
the
remark
that
were
there
no
hippopotami
he
had
no
doubt
this
would
be
the
parent
of
all
the
gardens
which
may
yet
be
in
this
new
sekeletu
now
returned
home
having
provided
a
company
of
men
to
carry
the
tusks
to
the
coast
and
the
expedition
set
forth
in
a
northward
direction
many
wars
had
decimated
the
country
but
there
were
ample
evidences
of
the
savagery
of
the
people
he
found
one
old
chief
living
in
a
house
surrounded
with
human
skulls
much
like
giant
pope
s
cave
in
the
pilgrim
s
many
of
the
skulls
were
of
mere
children
slain
by
the
chief
s
father
to
show
his
the
batoka
tribe
could
be
recognised
because
of
their
custom
of
knocking
out
the
upper
front
teeth
at
the
age
of
puberty
which
gave
them
an
uncouth
appearance
and
a
hideous
laugh
he
found
them
very
degraded
and
much
addicted
to
smoking
the
mutokwana
a
pernicious
weed
which
causes
a
species
of
frenzy
and
which
is
often
resorted
to
before
battle
as
the
native
form
of
dutch
on
the
of
december
they
had
a
foretaste
of
coming
peril
in
the
person
of
a
howling
dervish
who
came
at
livingstone
with
his
lips
covered
with
foam
and
with
a
small
in
his
hand
i
felt
it
would
be
a
sorry
way
to
leave
the
world
to
get
my
head
chopped
by
a
mad
savage
but
he
would
show
no
fear
and
by
and
by
the
paroxysm
of
frenzy
passed
away
later
on
they
heard
the
tribesmen
exulting
over
them
god
has
apportioned
them
to
us
they
cried
still
there
was
no
outbreak
and
the
expedition
moved
on
unmolested
the
country
was
now
seen
to
be
swarming
with
inhabitants
they
had
no
notion
of
any
invasion
of
their
territory
that
did
not
mean
conquest
and
plunder
but
when
the
villagers
listened
to
christ
s
promise
of
peace
on
earth
goodwill
to
men
they
expressed
satisfaction
give
us
rest
and
sleep
they
pleaded
the
chief
monze
further
on
was
urgent
that
a
white
man
should
come
and
live
among
his
people
and
his
sister
seconded
him
exclaiming
that
it
would
be
joy
to
sleep
without
dreaming
of
anyone
pursuing
one
with
a
livingstone
must
have
felt
like
dante
with
the
vision
of
the
inferno
before
his
eyes
they
travelled
on
through
a
healthy
and
beautiful
region
where
livingstone
could
indulge
to
the
full
his
love
of
natural
beauties
and
study
the
habits
of
the
wonderful
beasts
and
birds
they
kept
well
to
the
north
of
the
zambesi
and
the
first
organised
hostility
awaited
them
at
the
confluence
of
the
zambesi
and
the
loangwa
there
is
no
more
striking
or
characteristic
story
than
this
in
the
whole
of
livingstones
biography
the
chief
mburuma
had
shown
many
signs
of
treachery
and
had
roused
the
countryside
against
the
expedition
it
seemed
almost
certain
that
the
passage
of
the
loangwa
would
be
contested
the
people
were
collecting
in
large
numbers
and
remained
in
obstinate
suspicion
at
a
distance
from
the
camp
livingstone
s
own
reflections
are
to
be
gathered
from
the
entries
in
his
journal
on
january
for
has
come
he
writes
thank
god
for
his
great
mercies
this
far
how
soon
i
may
be
called
before
him
my
righteous
judge
i
know
not
on
thy
word
i
lean
the
cause
is
thine
see
o
lord
how
the
heathens
rise
up
against
me
as
they
did
against
thy
then
comes
a
very
characteristic
sentence
it
seems
a
pity
that
the
facts
about
the
two
healthy
longitudinal
regions
should
not
be
known
in
christendom
thy
will
be
later
on
in
the
evening
the
signs
are
even
more
ominous
felt
much
turmoil
of
spirit
in
view
of
having
all
my
plans
for
the
welfare
of
this
great
region
and
teeming
population
knocked
on
the
head
by
savages
but
jesus
came
and
said
all
power
is
given
to
me
in
heaven
and
on
earth
go
ye
therefore
and
teach
all
nations
and
lo
i
am
with
you
always
even
unto
the
end
of
the
it
is
the
word
of
a
gentleman
of
the
most
sacred
and
strictest
honour
and
there
is
an
end
on
t
i
will
not
cross
furtively
by
night
as
i
intended
it
would
appear
as
flight
and
should
such
a
man
as
i
flee
nay
verily
i
shall
take
observations
for
longitude
and
latitude
though
they
may
be
the
last
i
feel
quite
calm
now
thank
the
next
day
he
superintended
the
crossing
of
the
river
under
the
ægis
of
natives
armed
to
the
teeth
reserving
for
himself
the
post
of
honour
the
last
man
in
the
last
canoe
he
stepped
in
pushed
off
thanked
the
astonished
savages
and
wished
them
peace
then
passing
through
the
midst
of
them
he
went
his
they
had
never
seen
an
enemy
like
this
new
perils
arose
in
the
country
of
the
powerful
chief
mpende
and
again
livingstone
had
little
hope
of
avoiding
a
skirmish
but
he
succeeds
in
explaining
that
he
is
an
englishman
and
shows
them
his
white
skin
no
said
they
we
never
saw
skin
so
white
as
that
you
must
be
one
of
the
tribe
that
loves
the
black
he
accepted
the
compliment
and
when
later
he
needed
a
canoe
to
take
a
sick
man
across
the
river
mpende
exclaimed
this
white
man
is
truly
one
of
our
friends
see
how
he
lets
me
know
his
he
was
now
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
and
the
natives
were
peaceful
the
of
march
saw
the
expedition
within
eight
miles
of
tette
and
portuguese
officers
came
forward
to
help
and
welcome
him
he
succeeded
in
making
arrangements
for
his
makololo
to
be
cared
for
until
his
return
for
he
could
now
descend
the
river
by
boat
to
quilimane
nothing
but
death
he
told
them
would
prevent
his
return
the
leader
of
his
escort
however
sekwebu
he
had
resolved
to
take
to
england
with
him
the
result
was
tragic
the
extraordinary
experience
of
a
sea
voyage
unhinged
his
reason
and
when
mauritius
was
reached
he
sprang
overboard
and
was
lost
on
december
david
livingstone
reached
dover
having
narrowly
escaped
shipwreck
off
the
bay
of
tunis
and
having
crossed
the
continent
from
marseilles
to
calais
he
had
girdled
africa
from
west
to
east
he
was
universally
recognised
as
the
greatest
of
explorers
well
might
moffat
write
to
him
the
honours
awaiting
you
at
home
would
be
enough
to
make
a
score
of
light
heads
dizzy
you
have
succeeded
beyond
the
most
sanguine
expectation
in
laying
open
a
world
of
immortal
beings
all
needing
the
gospel
and
at
a
time
now
that
war
is
over
when
people
may
exert
their
energies
on
an
object
compared
with
which
that
which
has
occupied
the
master
minds
of
europe
and
expended
so
much
money
and
shed
so
much
blood
is
but
a
livingstone
s
own
simple
words
are
the
best
conclusion
of
this
chapter
none
has
cause
for
more
abundant
gratitude
to
his
and
to
his
maker
than
i
have
and
may
god
grant
that
the
effect
on
my
mind
be
such
that
i
may
be
more
humbly
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
author
of
all
our
chapter
vi
from
the
end
of
till
march
of
livingstone
was
home
he
had
been
parted
from
wife
and
children
for
five
long
years
and
nobody
realised
more
than
he
did
what
a
burden
of
anxiety
livingstone
had
carried
all
that
while
one
of
his
greatest
sorrows
was
the
death
of
his
father
whom
he
had
longed
to
see
again
but
who
died
during
livingstone
s
voyage
home
the
honours
bestowed
upon
him
were
numberless
the
freedom
of
the
city
of
glasgow
and
the
city
of
edinburgh
honorary
doctors
degrees
from
oxford
and
cambridge
and
the
gold
medal
of
the
geographical
society
were
only
a
few
of
his
distinctions
he
wrote
his
book
entitled
missionary
travels
in
and
it
was
a
phenomenal
success
the
simple
direct
unassuming
style
being
the
most
appropriate
clothing
for
the
thoughts
and
deeds
of
the
man
it
may
be
said
that
livingstone
s
writings
were
in
a
marked
degree
a
revelation
of
his
personality
and
character
you
could
not
read
the
narrative
without
wondering
at
the
achievements
and
conceiving
a
personal
affection
for
the
author
in
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
there
was
extraordinary
eagerness
to
see
and
hear
him
the
most
distinguished
people
competed
for
the
honour
of
entertaining
him
the
universities
showed
exceptional
enthusiasm
while
in
humbler
places
which
had
associations
with
his
fame
the
celebrations
were
touching
in
their
love
and
pride
much
of
the
public
laudation
was
distasteful
to
him
but
he
greatly
enjoyed
the
intercourse
now
open
to
him
with
men
and
women
of
kindred
spirit
in
all
churches
and
among
all
professions
one
problem
in
regard
to
the
future
was
settled
in
a
characteristic
way
believing
as
he
did
that
it
was
his
to
open
up
this
great
new
country
and
do
pioneer
work
in
the
african
interior
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
resign
his
position
under
the
london
missionary
society
as
some
of
its
supporters
might
not
approve
of
this
kind
of
work
being
undertaken
by
one
of
its
agents
at
the
same
time
he
was
exceedingly
anxious
that
the
work
of
the
society
should
not
suffer
and
regarded
it
as
his
own
duty
to
provide
a
substitute
accordingly
he
arranged
with
his
john
moffat
to
become
a
missionary
to
the
makololo
promising
him
for
outfit
and
a
year
for
five
years
as
salary
besides
other
sums
amounting
in
all
to
his
own
immediate
future
was
determined
by
the
offer
from
lord
palmerston
of
the
post
of
consul
at
quilimane
and
commander
of
an
expedition
for
exploring
eastern
and
central
africa
he
was
to
take
out
a
light
paddle
steamer
suitable
for
the
navigation
of
the
zambesi
and
his
colleagues
were
to
include
a
botanist
a
mining
expert
an
artist
and
a
ship
engineer
this
offer
was
cordially
accepted
and
all
arrangements
made
for
departure
there
will
always
be
some
people
the
victims
of
the
compartment
theory
of
life
who
will
hold
that
a
man
can
not
be
a
minister
or
a
missionary
if
he
is
anything
else
these
people
believe
that
if
a
man
becomes
an
explorer
he
ceases
to
be
a
missionary
to
be
consistent
they
ought
to
believe
that
when
paul
practised
as
a
he
ceased
to
be
an
apostle
or
that
a
bishop
becomes
a
secular
person
if
he
attends
to
his
parliamentary
duties
it
is
needless
to
say
that
livingstone
held
no
such
impossible
conception
of
the
ministry
he
never
at
any
time
ceased
to
be
a
missionary
all
his
work
was
regarded
by
him
as
sacred
because
it
was
done
for
the
glory
of
god
and
the
good
of
humanity
the
ends
that
he
pursued
till
the
close
of
his
life
were
essentially
the
same
that
he
had
sought
hitherto
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
righteousness
one
of
the
most
impressive
addresses
delivered
by
livingstone
during
this
visit
and
one
which
produced
the
most
lasting
effect
was
to
a
distinguished
university
audience
in
the
senate
house
at
cambridge
it
was
a
magnificent
and
irresistible
appeal
for
missionaries
he
was
amazed
that
some
of
our
societies
had
to
go
abroad
to
germany
for
missionaries
because
of
the
lack
of
the
missionary
spirit
at
home
he
repudiated
the
talk
about
sacrifice
he
had
made
no
sacrifice
worthy
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
as
the
great
sacrifice
made
for
mankind
by
christ
he
closed
with
this
impressive
appeal
i
beg
to
direct
your
attention
to
africa
i
know
that
in
a
few
years
i
shall
be
cut
off
in
that
country
which
is
now
open
do
not
let
it
be
shut
again
i
go
back
to
africa
to
try
to
make
an
open
path
for
commerce
and
christianity
do
you
carry
out
the
work
which
i
have
begun
i
leave
it
with
you
it
was
by
such
glowing
words
as
these
that
he
enforced
on
english
audiences
his
favourite
theme
that
the
end
of
the
geographical
feat
is
the
beginning
of
the
missionary
fresh
from
the
ovations
and
honours
which
reached
their
culmination
in
the
grand
final
banquet
at
the
freemason
s
hall
at
which
foreign
statesmen
dukes
earls
bishops
and
scientific
magnates
vied
with
one
another
in
celebrating
his
fame
livingstone
sailed
from
liverpool
on
colonial
steamer
nothing
had
been
wanting
to
his
success
he
was
now
rich
famous
powerful
the
accredited
representative
of
the
greatest
government
in
the
world
instead
of
having
to
provide
for
his
journeys
of
exploration
out
of
a
meagre
salary
and
the
generosity
of
african
chiefs
he
had
the
wealth
of
england
behind
him
and
limitless
goodwill
on
the
deck
of
the
pearl
were
the
sections
of
the
little
ma
robert
which
a
philanthropic
firm
had
sold
him
as
a
great
bargain
for
the
good
of
the
cause
and
which
was
the
most
clumsy
and
extravagant
vessel
that
ever
ruined
the
hopes
of
its
owner
going
back
with
him
was
his
wife
and
his
youngest
boy
his
brother
charles
too
had
been
assigned
to
him
as
a
colleague
by
a
generous
government
one
of
livingstone
s
first
acts
was
to
read
to
the
members
of
the
expedition
the
instructions
drawn
up
by
himself
with
the
sanction
of
the
foreign
office
in
these
he
laid
stress
on
an
example
of
consistent
moral
conduct
treating
the
people
with
kindness
inculcating
peace
and
goodwill
he
earnestly
pressed
upon
the
members
a
sacred
regard
to
life
and
the
avoidance
of
wanton
destruction
of
animals
and
expressed
the
hope
that
arms
would
never
be
needed
for
defence
against
the
natives
as
the
best
security
from
attack
consists
in
upright
he
insists
on
the
strictest
justice
in
dealing
with
the
natives
and
an
attitude
of
respect
to
the
chiefs
of
tribes
we
are
adherents
of
a
benign
holy
religion
and
may
by
consistent
conduct
and
wise
patient
efforts
become
the
harbingers
of
peace
to
a
hitherto
distracted
and
he
concluded
by
again
reiterating
that
a
kind
word
or
deed
is
never
these
instructions
are
very
notable
and
perhaps
one
may
read
between
the
lines
some
anxiety
and
even
apprehension
for
he
knew
that
the
success
of
the
expedition
no
longer
entirely
rested
on
himself
and
might
be
marred
by
and
unchristian
action
on
the
part
of
any
single
member
it
was
well
that
he
could
not
forecast
the
future
the
years
that
were
to
elapse
until
his
return
to
england
in
were
in
many
respects
tragic
years
they
were
years
of
accumulated
disappointments
bereavements
failures
and
rebuffs
faced
with
courage
and
borne
with
resignation
but
none
the
less
leaving
upon
his
life
the
shadow
of
great
and
crushing
sorrow
which
never
wholly
lifted
the
course
of
the
pearl
was
down
the
west
coast
of
africa
and
the
first
bitter
disappointment
was
when
his
wife
and
son
had
to
be
left
behind
at
cape
town
owing
to
fortunately
and
moffat
had
journeyed
down
country
to
meet
them
and
took
their
daughter
and
her
boy
back
to
kuruman
but
it
was
bitter
parting
with
my
wife
like
tearing
the
heart
out
of
livingstone
was
fated
to
do
his
work
in
loneliness
the
pearl
reached
the
mouth
of
the
zambesi
on
may
she
was
anchored
in
the
mangrove
swamps
a
deadly
place
for
fever
and
livingstone
insisted
on
the
small
launch
ma
robert
being
fitted
together
immediately
for
he
feared
the
consequences
to
the
newcomers
if
they
did
not
speedily
get
away
to
a
healthier
locality
this
meant
working
on
sunday
for
which
if
life
can
be
saved
there
is
sound
scripture
warrant
but
the
order
created
no
small
criticism
it
is
a
pity
writes
livingstone
that
some
people
can
not
see
that
the
true
and
honest
discharge
of
life
is
divine
the
next
trial
was
in
the
resignation
of
the
naval
officer
a
matter
in
regard
to
which
livingstone
was
fully
exonerated
by
the
foreign
office
but
which
none
the
less
brought
home
to
him
the
difficulties
of
his
new
position
instead
of
waiting
for
a
new
officer
livingstone
proceeded
to
run
the
ship
himself
it
was
imagined
we
could
not
help
ourselves
he
wrote
later
but
i
took
the
task
of
navigating
on
myself
and
have
conducted
the
steamer
over
miles
though
as
far
as
my
likings
go
i
would
as
soon
drive
a
cab
in
november
fogs
in
london
as
be
skipper
in
this
hot
sun
but
i
shall
go
through
with
it
as
a
there
was
some
genuine
compensation
when
he
reached
tette
and
was
hailed
with
delirious
delight
by
his
old
makololo
friends
who
had
never
ceased
to
believe
that
he
would
keep
his
word
to
them
the
tette
people
often
taunted
us
by
saying
your
englishman
will
never
return
but
we
trusted
you
and
now
we
shall
disease
and
fighting
had
thinned
their
ranks
thirty
had
died
of
smallpox
and
six
had
been
killed
livingstone
had
some
work
to
do
before
he
was
ready
to
march
back
with
the
survivors
to
linyanti
but
they
knew
he
would
not
fail
them
already
it
was
clear
that
the
ma
robert
was
almost
useless
livingstone
had
applied
to
the
government
for
a
more
suitable
vessel
and
had
also
ordered
one
on
his
own
account
he
had
intended
to
spend
but
eventually
he
devoted
nearly
the
whole
of
the
profits
of
his
book
some
to
the
purchase
of
the
little
steamer
lake
nyassa
which
he
specially
destined
for
the
lake
whose
name
she
bore
but
whose
waters
she
never
sailed
the
government
acceded
to
the
request
but
the
pioneer
did
not
arrive
till
early
in
and
the
lake
nyassa
a
year
later
the
latter
vessel
having
then
to
be
put
together
which
occupied
many
months
there
were
two
years
therefore
to
be
devoted
to
what
explorations
were
possible
with
the
aid
of
the
ma
robert
now
frivolously
called
the
asthmatic
and
their
own
exertions
it
was
clear
to
livingstone
that
the
shiré
river
a
tributary
of
the
zambesi
out
of
the
north
country
was
a
very
important
feature
and
ought
to
be
thoroughly
examined
it
was
quite
possible
that
it
might
prove
to
be
a
highway
to
the
inland
lakes
of
which
rumour
reached
him
so
the
first
months
of
were
devoted
to
this
journey
the
party
made
their
way
up
till
they
were
stopped
by
cataracts
which
were
named
the
murchison
falls
little
could
be
done
among
the
natives
who
were
very
suspicious
and
armed
with
poisoned
arrows
it
was
necessary
constantly
to
assure
them
that
the
expedition
was
not
portuguese
but
english
for
the
terror
of
was
like
a
perpetual
nightmare
over
the
people
a
second
attempt
on
the
shiré
two
months
later
had
more
notable
results
they
were
inspired
to
strike
away
from
the
river
to
the
east
and
discovered
lake
shirwa
the
lake
lay
feet
up
and
was
sixty
miles
long
it
is
remarkable
that
the
portuguese
had
no
idea
of
its
existence
livingstone
describes
its
remarkable
beauty
and
the
grandeur
of
its
setting
among
the
mountains
some
of
which
rise
to
the
height
of
feet
much
higher
than
any
you
see
in
scotland
he
writes
to
his
little
daughter
agnes
he
is
increasingly
impressed
that
the
whole
region
is
suitable
for
cotton
and
sugar
the
land
is
so
rich
that
the
grass
towers
far
over
one
s
head
in
the
party
went
back
to
the
mouth
of
the
zambesi
for
stores
and
then
returned
to
make
a
determined
effort
to
find
lake
nyassa
passing
beyond
the
cataracts
they
were
assured
by
a
chief
that
the
river
shiré
stretched
on
for
two
months
and
then
came
out
between
perpendicular
rocks
which
could
not
be
let
us
go
back
to
the
ship
said
the
makololo
who
were
with
them
it
is
no
use
trying
to
find
this
we
shall
see
the
wonderful
rocks
at
any
rate
said
livingstone
yes
they
grumbled
and
when
you
see
them
you
will
just
want
to
see
something
however
the
curiosity
of
the
englishmen
was
by
this
time
thoroughly
aroused
and
they
pushed
forward
till
on
the
of
september
they
discovered
lake
nyassa
they
had
not
time
to
do
much
by
way
of
exploration
and
two
years
were
to
elapse
before
livingstone
returned
and
satisfied
himself
that
the
lake
was
at
least
two
hundred
miles
long
and
that
it
had
endless
possibilities
in
view
of
future
colonisation
but
even
now
the
slavers
were
active
and
gangs
of
unfortunate
captives
were
being
marched
to
the
coast
greatly
to
the
indignation
of
the
makololo
who
wondered
why
livingstone
would
not
let
them
choke
the
marauders
but
he
was
occupied
with
more
heroic
measures
that
would
lay
an
axe
to
the
roots
of
the
the
highlands
of
the
shiré
the
fertility
and
healthiness
of
the
country
and
the
proximity
to
the
great
waterway
together
with
the
lake
stretching
two
hundred
miles
to
the
north
filled
his
brain
with
schemes
for
colonising
the
district
it
is
the
best
white
man
s
country
he
has
seen
and
he
bombards
his
english
friends
with
letters
on
the
subject
why
should
honest
poor
folk
at
home
make
a
miserable
pittance
by
cultivating
small
crofts
of
land
when
here
is
a
vast
undeveloped
country
waiting
for
their
occupation
with
the
and
safety
of
a
large
population
to
be
secured
by
their
presence
he
is
personally
prepared
to
embark
two
or
three
thousand
pounds
in
such
an
enterprise
it
ought
not
to
be
looked
on
as
the
last
shift
a
family
can
come
to
but
the
performance
of
an
imperative
duty
to
our
blood
our
country
our
religion
and
to
human
while
waiting
the
response
of
england
to
these
appeals
he
is
off
with
his
makololo
for
six
months
to
see
them
back
to
their
land
and
to
their
folks
some
have
perished
as
we
have
seen
some
had
no
wish
to
return
about
thirty
of
them
deserted
before
they
had
gone
far
leaving
about
sixty
to
go
forward
livingstone
s
white
companions
were
his
brother
and
kirk
afterwards
sir
john
kirk
who
had
proved
himself
an
invaluable
friend
and
comrade
as
for
the
great
traveller
himself
it
was
with
real
joy
that
he
found
himself
on
the
old
trail
marching
and
camping
in
the
fashion
so
reminiscent
of
earlier
days
there
are
the
same
tasks
and
toils
the
same
fight
with
hunger
and
fatigue
and
fever
but
it
cheers
his
heart
he
rejoiceth
as
a
strong
man
to
run
his
at
times
however
he
is
compelled
to
realise
how
hard
it
is
to
do
good
and
not
do
evil
with
it
he
has
opened
up
a
path
and
the
first
to
follow
him
is
the
portuguese
or
arab
he
feels
that
he
has
been
made
the
instrument
of
the
undoing
of
some
innocent
people
and
his
heart
is
heavy
only
christian
settlements
can
defeat
these
sinister
enterprises
in
august
they
were
at
the
victoria
falls
and
most
unexpectedly
find
a
white
man
there
baldwin
by
name
who
has
news
of
a
great
tragedy
that
fills
livingstone
s
soul
with
sorrow
one
of
the
results
of
his
missionary
appeals
in
england
had
been
that
the
london
missionary
society
had
resolved
on
a
mission
at
linyanti
nine
europeans
set
out
for
this
spot
and
baldwin
had
helped
them
on
the
way
but
the
head
of
the
mission
helmore
and
his
wife
had
perished
of
fever
and
three
others
succumbed
later
so
that
the
survivors
gave
up
in
alarm
and
retired
livingstone
was
too
late
to
be
of
service
though
he
was
certain
his
remedies
might
have
saved
their
lives
even
this
is
not
all
for
poor
sekeletu
is
stricken
with
leprosy
and
is
living
away
from
his
people
believing
himself
to
be
bewitched
his
joy
however
at
livingstone
s
return
is
unbounded
and
the
general
happiness
does
something
to
make
up
for
the
sad
news
by
which
all
have
been
depressed
he
is
cheered
also
to
hear
that
his
old
friend
sechele
was
doing
well
and
happy
in
the
possession
of
a
hanoverian
missionary
and
in
the
progress
of
christian
teaching
it
was
with
evident
satisfaction
that
livingstone
british
consul
resumed
his
old
labours
of
preaching
and
teaching
it
could
not
be
for
long
for
he
had
to
be
back
on
the
zambesi
but
he
could
not
neglect
any
opportunity
of
doing
definitely
spiritual
work
they
reached
tette
once
more
on
november
and
travelled
down
the
river
in
the
ma
robert
the
last
voyage
of
that
a
month
later
she
grounded
on
a
sandbank
and
filled
and
without
remorse
they
left
her
at
the
bottom
of
the
zambesi
to
livingstone
it
seemed
that
was
to
mark
the
opening
of
a
new
era
for
the
steamer
pioneer
arrived
at
the
end
of
january
and
with
it
bishop
mackenzie
and
his
staff
whose
object
was
to
plant
the
universities
mission
another
fruit
of
livingstone
s
memorable
home
visit
livingstone
liked
the
bishop
from
the
first
for
his
manly
character
his
devotion
and
his
differences
of
denomination
affected
him
not
at
all
he
looks
upon
all
godly
men
as
good
and
true
he
thought
the
bishop
like
moffat
in
his
readiness
to
put
his
hand
to
some
time
was
lost
in
exploration
of
the
river
rovuma
which
came
to
nothing
then
the
navigation
of
the
shiré
with
the
pioneer
proved
very
slow
and
laborious
because
of
low
water
and
sandbanks
worse
than
all
the
whole
country
seemed
to
have
been
ravaged
by
the
slavers
and
it
was
evident
that
the
portuguese
government
officials
were
in
active
connivance
at
the
village
of
mbame
on
the
shiré
livingstone
and
the
bishop
liberated
a
gang
of
men
and
women
and
attached
them
to
the
mission
settlement
a
peculiarly
murderous
native
chief
the
head
of
a
fierce
tribe
called
the
ajawa
was
doing
the
deadly
work
for
the
portuguese
and
when
a
visit
was
paid
to
him
to
persuade
him
to
desist
he
fired
on
the
mission
party
and
the
fire
was
returned
it
was
an
ominous
beginning
of
an
enterprise
that
had
tragical
developments
it
was
difficult
for
the
bishop
to
remain
a
spectator
of
all
these
murderous
onslaughts
but
livingstone
strongly
advised
him
not
to
interfere
in
tribal
quarrels
if
he
could
avoid
it
a
little
later
the
bishop
returned
to
the
ship
and
assured
livingstone
that
the
ajawa
were
more
peaceably
disposed
the
latter
heard
the
report
with
suspicions
that
proved
the
bishop
went
back
to
his
station
and
livingstone
s
thoughts
were
turned
to
the
prospective
arrival
of
the
that
was
to
bring
his
own
new
vessel
the
lake
nyassa
as
well
as
his
wife
the
bishop
s
sister
and
some
more
members
of
the
mission
the
ship
was
spoken
at
the
end
of
january
and
among
other
passengers
was
the
rev
james
stewart
afterwards
so
well
known
as
stewart
of
lovedale
he
had
come
to
represent
the
united
free
church
of
scotland
and
survey
for
a
mission
station
the
bishop
had
not
appeared
to
meet
his
sister
and
boats
were
despatched
up
river
to
find
him
miss
mackenzie
and
burrup
the
wife
of
one
of
the
bishop
s
colleagues
went
with
the
boats
what
they
actually
found
was
the
story
that
the
bishop
and
burrup
were
dead
of
fever
after
an
expedition
to
rescue
the
captive
husbands
of
some
manganja
women
the
blow
to
livingstone
was
a
crushing
one
for
though
he
had
never
been
able
wholly
to
approve
the
policy
of
the
mission
he
was
too
chivalrous
to
criticise
in
such
an
hour
and
declared
that
had
he
been
with
the
bishop
he
might
have
done
the
same
this
will
hurt
us
all
he
said
prophetically
as
the
two
women
came
back
to
shupanga
with
the
terrible
tidings
he
knew
well
that
the
portuguese
would
misrepresent
the
object
of
missionary
settlements
to
be
to
interfere
among
the
tribes
and
even
to
make
use
of
military
force
so
adding
to
the
mischief
instead
of
abating
it
we
must
bow
to
the
will
of
him
who
doeth
all
things
well
he
writes
but
i
can
not
help
feeling
sadly
disturbed
in
view
of
the
effect
the
news
may
have
at
home
i
shall
not
swerve
a
hair
from
my
work
while
life
is
some
weeks
were
spent
in
arranging
for
the
return
of
the
bereaved
women
who
did
not
sail
for
home
till
april
meanwhile
an
even
darker
cloud
of
sorrow
was
preparing
to
break
over
livingstone
his
wife
had
only
returned
to
him
to
die
she
had
been
to
kuruman
where
their
youngest
child
was
born
then
she
had
returned
to
scotland
to
see
the
other
children
but
her
longing
to
be
at
her
husband
s
side
was
intense
and
at
last
she
had
come
back
to
him
on
april
she
was
taken
ill
with
fever
and
on
the
evening
of
sunday
in
the
presence
of
stewart
and
her
husband
she
sank
to
rest
stewart
tells
us
how
he
found
livingstone
sitting
by
the
side
of
a
rude
bed
formed
of
boxes
but
covered
with
a
soft
mattress
on
which
lay
his
dying
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
livingstone
says
he
would
be
content
to
die
he
laid
her
to
rest
under
a
baobab
tree
on
shupanga
his
diary
reveals
the
agony
of
his
heart
henceforth
the
red
hills
and
white
vales
of
shupanga
are
with
him
in
all
his
wanderings
in
some
other
spot
i
may
have
looked
at
my
own
may
be
allotted
i
have
often
wished
that
it
might
be
in
some
still
deep
forest
where
i
may
sleep
sweetly
till
the
resurrection
i
loved
her
when
i
married
her
and
the
longer
i
lived
with
her
the
more
i
loved
her
oh
my
mary
my
mary
how
often
we
have
longed
for
a
quiet
home
since
you
and
i
were
cast
adrift
at
kolobeng
surely
the
removal
by
a
kind
father
who
knoweth
our
frame
means
that
he
rewarded
you
by
taking
you
to
the
best
home
the
eternal
one
in
the
for
such
comfort
as
could
be
obtained
in
such
dark
days
he
turned
again
to
his
work
the
fight
against
slavery
is
becoming
more
and
more
desperate
even
the
navigation
of
the
river
is
now
a
horror
the
waters
are
ghastly
with
corpses
the
paddles
had
to
be
cleared
of
bodies
caught
in
the
floats
at
human
skeletons
were
found
in
all
directions
many
had
ended
their
misery
under
shady
trees
others
under
projecting
crags
in
the
hills
while
others
lay
in
their
huts
with
closed
doors
which
when
opened
disclosed
the
mouldering
corpse
with
the
poor
cloth
round
the
loins
the
skull
fallen
off
the
pillow
the
little
skeleton
of
the
child
that
had
perished
first
rolled
up
in
a
mat
between
two
large
eighteen
months
before
this
was
a
valley
now
it
is
a
desert
literally
strewn
with
human
to
complete
his
despair
the
mission
of
bishop
mackenzie
is
removed
by
order
to
zanzibar
despite
livingstone
s
urgent
entreaty
and
finally
in
july
he
himself
received
from
lord
russell
the
news
that
he
was
recalled
he
does
not
blame
the
government
he
has
expected
this
but
the
bitterness
is
that
miles
of
coast
are
abandoned
to
those
who
were
the
first
to
begin
the
and
seem
determined
to
be
the
last
to
abandon
his
instructions
as
to
handing
back
the
pioneer
to
the
government
men
were
quite
explicit
and
it
was
clear
that
he
had
little
time
left
in
africa
yet
before
he
returned
to
england
he
accomplished
two
feats
that
would
have
made
the
reputation
of
any
other
man
with
only
one
white
colleague
and
five
makololo
he
marched
seven
hundred
and
sixty
miles
in
days
getting
to
within
ten
days
march
of
lake
bangweolo
or
bemba
and
the
village
of
ilala
where
years
later
his
own
heart
was
to
be
buried
he
would
have
reached
the
lake
but
for
the
duty
of
fulfilling
his
instructions
from
the
government
the
second
great
feat
was
on
the
ocean
he
had
to
face
the
problem
of
his
own
admirable
little
steamer
the
lake
she
had
cost
him
a
fortune
and
he
needed
the
money
he
could
have
sold
her
as
a
but
sooner
than
do
that
he
would
sink
her
in
the
indian
ocean
after
many
adventures
he
gets
her
to
zanzibar
but
can
not
get
a
fair
price
the
one
chance
left
is
to
sail
her
across
the
indian
ocean
and
sell
her
in
bombay
it
was
the
wildest
adventure
but
it
was
worthy
of
him
he
could
take
but
fourteen
tons
of
coal
and
the
distance
was
miles
the
crew
consisted
of
himself
a
stoker
a
carpenter
and
a
sailor
seven
native
zanzibarians
and
two
boys
one
of
whom
was
chumah
who
was
with
him
on
his
last
march
the
voyage
took
days
much
of
it
marked
by
dead
calm
but
the
latter
part
by
furious
squalls
the
sails
were
torn
and
the
little
boat
nearly
rolled
right
over
but
god
s
good
providence
is
over
us
and
on
june
they
creep
into
the
harbour
through
the
fog
their
entrance
being
unobserved
he
stays
in
bombay
a
short
time
interesting
the
merchants
in
east
african
trade
then
he
takes
ship
for
england
where
he
arrived
on
july
the
livingstone
who
thus
returned
for
his
last
visit
home
was
in
some
respects
a
very
altered
man
from
the
one
who
took
england
by
storm
at
the
close
of
his
first
great
explorations
he
had
suffered
severe
personal
losses
his
wife
s
death
had
left
him
lonely
and
sad
with
the
deep
and
lasting
sadness
of
a
strong
nature
his
grief
and
disappointment
over
the
tragedy
of
the
universities
mission
had
left
their
mark
upon
him
but
two
experiences
had
changed
his
outlook
even
more
radically
in
the
first
place
he
had
seen
the
limitations
inseparable
from
the
life
of
a
government
official
his
position
as
a
consul
had
not
helped
him
while
at
the
same
time
it
had
made
his
attitude
towards
the
portuguese
more
difficult
he
could
not
be
his
own
free
and
independent
self
when
the
relations
of
two
european
powers
were
at
stake
his
recall
was
something
of
a
relief
he
was
now
unmuzzled
and
gentle
and
kindly
as
his
spirit
was
livingstone
was
capable
of
what
we
may
dare
to
speak
of
as
the
wrath
of
the
it
becomes
more
and
more
evident
during
this
visit
that
his
heart
had
turned
back
in
full
affection
to
his
original
vocation
and
work
as
a
missionary
and
when
the
next
negotiations
were
opened
up
with
him
he
bluntly
avows
his
determination
to
return
only
on
the
condition
that
he
may
pursue
his
travels
in
that
capacity
the
second
experience
was
of
course
his
full
contact
with
all
the
indescribable
villainies
of
the
slave
trade
he
had
seen
enough
of
the
miseries
it
involved
during
his
journey
to
loanda
but
the
west
coast
was
vigilantly
watched
by
english
cruisers
and
the
slave
trade
reduced
to
comparatively
small
proportions
on
the
east
coast
portugal
was
in
authority
and
her
connivance
and
sympathy
were
responsible
for
the
vast
extent
of
the
operations
of
the
raiders
livingstone
came
back
to
england
in
the
grip
of
a
great
and
noble
passion
a
fiery
indignation
against
the
barbarities
of
this
traffic
in
flesh
and
blood
and
he
sternly
resolved
to
fight
it
if
need
be
he
had
no
heart
to
pursue
purely
scientific
observations
or
geographical
explorations
to
gratify
the
intellectuals
while
africa
was
being
desolated
and
her
population
laid
waste
the
great
public
might
complain
that
he
no
longer
tickled
their
ears
with
thrilling
or
amusing
descriptions
of
adventures
he
was
as
thomas
hughes
truly
said
a
great
puritan
traveller
and
the
moral
ends
of
his
labours
remained
with
him
ever
supreme
with
such
a
fire
consuming
him
it
may
easily
be
realised
that
he
found
the
foreign
office
the
year
was
america
was
washing
out
the
guilt
of
centuries
in
the
blood
of
her
bravest
and
best
livingstone
s
own
boy
robert
who
had
been
somewhat
erratic
had
heard
his
call
and
was
fighting
in
the
federal
ranks
on
his
way
to
a
grave
in
gettysburg
cemetery
never
in
the
history
of
the
world
had
slavery
revealed
itself
so
convincingly
as
a
hideous
cancer
in
the
social
system
but
official
england
was
she
had
begun
by
believing
that
jeff
davis
was
making
a
nation
she
had
reached
the
stage
of
chill
condescension
towards
abraham
lincoln
for
whom
livingstone
had
a
true
man
s
admiration
and
affection
the
foreign
office
was
in
no
mind
to
take
an
heroic
line
and
was
no
doubt
heartily
relieved
that
livingstone
had
not
made
a
greater
fuss
about
his
recall
it
was
not
to
make
a
fuss
about
his
personal
affairs
however
that
livingstone
had
come
home
the
fuss
was
to
be
about
his
friends
the
natives
who
were
being
done
to
death
in
thousands
and
the
residue
sold
into
degradation
and
forced
labour
he
opened
the
battle
in
a
lecture
to
the
british
association
at
bath
and
so
effective
an
opening
was
it
that
the
portuguese
had
to
put
up
senhor
lacerda
the
traveller
to
declare
that
it
was
manifest
that
livingstone
under
the
pretext
of
propagating
the
word
of
god
and
the
advancement
of
geographical
and
natural
science
was
bent
on
robbing
portugal
of
the
advantages
of
the
rich
commerce
of
the
rich
commerce
is
good
the
learned
senhor
goes
on
to
urge
that
livingstone
s
audacious
and
mischievous
actions
ought
to
be
this
was
a
pretty
plain
hint
to
the
portuguese
authorities
and
not
lost
on
them
as
we
shall
see
the
next
move
in
the
war
lay
with
livingstone
this
was
the
book
in
which
he
proposed
to
lay
the
whole
scandal
bare
he
wrote
this
book
at
newstead
abbey
the
home
of
his
hospitable
friends
and
webb
the
former
of
whom
was
a
noted
african
hunter
the
day
he
finished
his
book
was
the
day
when
lincoln
was
assassinated
in
washington
the
book
finished
he
was
to
settle
a
question
which
sir
roderick
murchison
had
raised
with
him
of
a
return
to
africa
for
purely
geographical
purposes
livingstone
is
all
eagerness
to
return
and
the
line
of
exploration
suggested
on
the
inland
lakes
appeals
to
him
strongly
but
he
answers
that
he
can
only
feel
in
the
way
of
duty
by
working
as
a
missionary
he
writes
to
james
young
i
would
not
consent
to
go
simply
as
a
geographer
but
as
a
missionary
and
do
geography
by
the
way
because
i
feel
i
am
in
the
way
of
duty
when
trying
either
to
enlighten
these
poor
people
or
open
their
land
to
lawful
later
on
came
an
informal
request
from
lord
palmerston
to
know
what
he
could
do
for
him
it
may
be
doubted
whether
that
decidedly
worldly
statesman
ever
anticipated
so
disinterested
a
reply
as
he
received
instead
of
bargaining
for
salary
or
pension
livingstone
replied
that
he
wanted
but
one
thing
free
access
to
the
highlands
by
the
zambesi
and
shiré
to
be
secured
by
a
treaty
with
governments
find
those
men
easiest
to
deal
with
who
are
satisfied
with
a
lump
sum
down
in
the
interval
of
fixing
up
his
arrangements
with
the
government
and
the
royal
geographical
society
livingstone
had
a
personal
sorrow
in
the
death
of
his
mother
at
the
age
of
he
was
glad
however
to
be
at
home
to
fulfil
her
wish
that
one
of
her
laddies
should
lay
her
head
in
the
after
that
he
visited
the
school
which
his
children
attended
and
made
a
short
speech
the
last
words
he
uttered
in
public
in
scotland
were
the
simple
ones
fear
god
and
work
the
negotiations
in
regard
to
his
new
work
were
finally
completed
the
government
gave
and
the
royal
geographical
society
an
equal
sum
a
private
friend
added
a
thousand
pounds
this
was
all
except
that
he
was
to
be
the
unsalaried
consul
with
power
over
the
chiefs
on
the
coast
between
portuguese
territory
and
abyssinia
he
was
also
warned
to
expect
no
pension
it
is
useless
now
to
indulge
in
belated
indignation
over
these
very
unhandsome
terms
probably
if
they
were
put
into
plain
black
and
white
they
meant
that
the
great
british
government
presented
david
livingstone
with
and
a
sphere
of
influence
to
keep
him
from
making
mischief
with
the
portuguese
by
expressing
honest
british
hatred
of
the
slave
trade
while
the
geographical
society
hoped
to
tie
him
up
to
geographical
work
and
so
prevent
him
wasting
his
time
and
talents
on
fatuous
missionary
enterprises
what
actually
happened
we
shall
see
in
due
course
meanwhile
livingstone
s
own
personal
plan
was
to
sell
his
steamer
at
bombay
in
order
to
make
up
the
deficiency
in
the
cost
of
his
new
expedition
due
to
the
financial
economy
of
a
lukewarm
government
it
was
for
bombay
accordingly
that
he
departed
in
august
he
never
saw
these
shores
again
chapter
vii
when
livingstone
arrived
in
bombay
in
september
sir
bartle
frere
was
governor
they
were
old
friends
and
the
governor
became
his
very
sympathetic
host
his
immediate
purpose
was
to
dispose
of
the
lake
nyassa
for
what
she
would
fetch
this
proved
to
be
for
a
steamer
that
had
cost
him
it
was
a
poor
bargain
but
he
was
not
in
a
position
to
refuse
it
and
as
things
turned
out
he
got
no
good
out
of
it
he
deposited
the
money
in
an
indian
bank
which
in
a
few
weeks
failed
miserably
and
livingstone
s
money
was
seen
no
more
as
he
cared
for
money
less
than
any
man
he
did
not
allow
himself
to
be
unduly
depressed
by
this
misfortune
the
whole
of
the
money
she
cost
he
wrote
was
dedicated
to
the
great
cause
for
which
she
was
built
we
are
not
responsible
for
his
preparations
in
bombay
for
the
forthcoming
expedition
were
for
him
quite
elaborate
and
we
may
add
at
once
gave
little
satisfaction
in
the
sequel
there
is
a
training
school
under
government
for
africans
at
nassick
nine
of
the
men
volunteered
to
go
with
him
besides
these
he
was
supplied
with
sepoys
from
the
marine
he
was
assured
that
they
had
been
accustomed
to
rough
it
in
various
ways
in
practice
they
would
only
march
five
miles
a
day
were
notorious
skulkers
and
disgusted
livingstone
by
their
cruelty
to
the
brute
beasts
it
was
not
long
before
he
dismissed
them
to
their
homes
the
nassick
boys
were
not
much
more
manageable
the
expedition
included
ten
johanna
men
who
were
only
a
moderate
success
two
shupanga
men
including
susi
and
two
wayaus
including
chumah
susi
and
chumah
it
will
be
remembered
were
with
him
at
the
last
chumah
was
a
liberated
slave
who
owed
his
freedom
to
livingstone
and
bishop
mackenzie
in
the
expedition
was
further
distinguished
by
a
number
of
animals
imported
by
livingstone
from
india
six
camels
three
buffaloes
and
a
calf
two
mules
and
four
donkeys
he
was
anxious
to
prove
that
camels
were
immune
from
the
bites
of
the
tsetse
flies
and
he
expected
to
acclimatise
the
other
beasts
and
teach
some
native
chief
to
breed
them
the
sultan
of
zanzibar
was
cordial
and
armed
livingstone
with
a
letter
to
be
used
as
a
passport
then
he
took
his
leave
and
on
the
of
march
he
is
at
the
mouth
of
the
rovuma
with
all
his
caravan
complete
the
navigation
of
the
shallow
river
proved
unexpectedly
difficult
and
occasioned
tedious
delay
and
some
anxiety
so
at
last
he
sails
north
again
and
gets
all
his
animals
landed
in
mikindany
bay
he
is
too
old
a
traveller
not
to
realise
that
his
troubles
are
all
in
front
of
him
but
he
does
not
anticipate
them
and
writes
in
high
spirits
of
the
joy
of
setting
out
once
more
into
wild
and
unexplored
country
as
david
livingstone
is
now
starting
on
his
last
and
greatest
march
which
was
to
be
lengthened
out
year
after
year
and
to
be
signalised
by
unparalleled
sufferings
and
heroic
endurance
it
will
be
well
to
acquaint
ourselves
with
such
plans
as
he
had
somewhat
vaguely
laid
down
he
realised
that
there
are
three
great
main
waterways
into
the
african
interior
the
congo
the
zambesi
and
the
nile
he
was
satisfied
that
no
future
exploration
could
do
other
than
confirm
his
conclusions
as
to
the
watershed
which
he
had
traversed
from
which
certain
rivers
flowed
north
to
the
congo
and
certain
others
south
to
the
zambesi
but
from
earliest
times
the
scientific
imagination
had
been
captured
by
the
problem
of
the
sources
of
the
nile
this
was
the
greatest
of
all
unsolved
geographical
problems
and
to
it
livingstone
was
attracted
irresistibly
not
only
by
his
own
native
curiosity
but
by
that
interest
in
classical
questions
which
was
a
very
marked
characteristic
of
his
mind
to
this
problem
he
knew
that
the
system
of
inland
lakes
was
the
clue
and
that
whoever
could
completely
explore
them
would
settle
the
question
for
all
time
and
make
himself
an
everlasting
that
he
would
have
numberless
opportunities
of
proclaiming
christ
to
the
scattered
peoples
of
the
interior
and
would
cut
across
the
slave
routes
and
perhaps
be
able
to
scheme
out
how
to
defeat
the
devilish
purposes
of
the
slavers
were
motives
with
him
even
more
powerful
so
he
got
his
caravan
under
way
marched
south
to
rovuma
and
then
across
the
four
hundred
miles
of
country
that
lay
between
the
coast
and
lake
nyassa
the
first
stages
were
made
miserable
to
livingstone
by
the
brutality
of
the
sepoys
to
the
dumb
beasts
they
were
overloaded
and
overstrained
and
cruelly
maltreated
some
of
them
die
of
sores
which
the
sepoys
insist
are
caused
by
tsetse
or
by
accidents
meanwhile
progress
is
depressingly
slow
the
district
through
which
the
expedition
passes
is
and
food
is
most
difficult
to
obtain
the
sepoys
go
from
bad
to
worse
and
in
two
months
are
openly
mutinous
they
kill
one
camel
beating
it
over
the
head
and
set
themselves
to
corrupt
the
nassick
boys
so
as
to
tire
livingstone
out
for
weeks
together
it
is
nothing
but
one
endless
struggle
on
the
part
of
the
leader
against
this
conspiracy
to
defeat
his
plans
sometimes
he
tries
the
offer
of
increased
wages
sometimes
the
threat
of
corporal
punishment
but
the
indolence
cruelty
and
illwill
of
the
sepoys
threaten
the
success
of
the
expedition
and
the
spirit
of
disaffection
spreads
to
the
nassick
boys
it
is
the
of
june
we
passed
a
woman
tied
by
the
neck
to
a
tree
and
dead
the
people
of
the
country
explained
that
she
had
been
unable
to
keep
up
with
the
other
slaves
in
a
gang
i
may
mention
here
that
we
saw
others
tied
up
in
a
similar
manner
and
one
lying
in
the
path
shot
or
stabbed
for
she
was
in
a
pool
of
they
were
on
the
red
trail
now
and
livingstone
s
feet
never
left
it
till
death
brought
him
release
on
the
of
june
they
found
a
number
of
slaves
with
on
abandoned
by
their
masters
from
want
of
food
they
were
too
weak
to
be
able
to
speak
or
to
say
where
they
had
come
from
some
were
quite
the
middle
of
july
found
them
in
mataka
s
country
with
whom
livingstone
made
fast
friends
the
town
lay
in
an
elevated
valley
surrounded
by
mountains
and
food
was
plentiful
so
that
they
were
able
to
make
up
for
many
privations
it
was
here
that
livingstone
resolved
to
send
the
sepoys
back
they
had
become
quite
intolerable
shirking
work
stealing
and
infecting
all
the
company
with
their
one
of
the
incidents
that
most
pleased
livingstone
during
his
stay
with
mataka
was
the
release
by
the
chief
of
a
large
company
of
slaves
the
expedition
left
for
lake
nyassa
on
july
it
was
mountainous
travelling
now
but
the
country
between
them
and
the
lake
was
under
mataka
and
his
guides
were
sworn
to
take
them
safely
progress
was
still
slow
though
decidedly
more
pleasant
in
the
absence
of
the
sepoys
sometimes
they
came
on
arab
encampments
where
the
slaves
were
herded
in
great
pens
from
to
form
a
gang
according
to
livingstone
s
estimate
as
they
drew
near
the
lake
food
was
plentiful
and
game
abundant
on
august
we
came
to
the
lake
at
the
confluence
of
the
misinjé
and
felt
grateful
to
that
hand
which
had
protected
us
thus
far
on
our
journey
it
was
as
if
i
had
come
back
to
an
old
home
i
never
expected
again
to
see
and
pleasant
to
bathe
in
the
delicious
waters
again
hear
the
roar
of
the
sea
and
dash
in
the
rollers
i
feel
quite
it
had
taken
four
months
to
reach
lake
nyassa
from
the
coast
livingstone
s
plan
had
been
to
cross
the
lake
by
means
of
arab
dhows
and
resume
explorations
on
the
west
side
but
the
arabs
fled
from
him
as
from
the
plague
and
took
every
care
that
no
dhows
were
at
his
disposal
so
he
was
driven
to
march
round
to
the
foot
of
the
lake
where
he
was
again
on
familiar
ground
and
utters
anew
his
lamentations
over
the
untimely
end
of
the
universities
mission
which
he
had
always
seen
in
his
mind
s
eye
standing
sentinel
over
this
great
inland
sea
and
holding
the
country
for
christ
and
freedom
the
end
of
september
finds
the
expedition
on
the
shiré
and
now
rumour
reaches
them
of
wars
and
troubles
ahead
which
causes
the
johanna
men
to
desert
in
a
body
and
livingstone
does
not
indulge
in
many
regrets
they
were
inveterate
thieves
but
he
is
left
with
a
party
inconveniently
small
the
sequel
to
this
treachery
on
the
part
of
the
johanna
men
was
that
to
justify
themselves
they
invented
and
circulated
a
most
plausible
and
circumstantial
story
of
livingstone
s
murder
a
story
which
imposed
upon
many
of
his
friends
and
produced
a
crop
of
laudatory
obituary
notices
in
the
papers
the
story
was
as
thoroughly
disbelieved
by
livingstone
s
old
friend
young
who
well
knew
how
the
leader
of
these
men
could
lie
young
came
out
to
africa
at
once
bringing
with
him
a
steel
boat
the
search
which
by
the
aid
of
some
makololo
men
was
successfully
transported
to
lake
nyassa
and
floated
there
young
effectually
disproved
the
johanna
legend
and
in
eight
months
was
back
again
in
england
having
discovered
that
livingstone
had
passed
safely
on
toward
the
the
depleted
expedition
found
itself
now
in
very
mountainous
regions
and
enjoyed
the
noble
prospects
afforded
from
many
of
the
high
plateaux
which
they
reached
their
faces
were
to
the
north
towards
the
loangwa
river
and
the
distant
lake
tanganyika
no
opportunity
is
lost
by
the
way
of
preaching
to
all
the
tribes
our
relationship
to
our
father
his
love
for
all
his
children
the
guilt
of
selling
any
of
his
children
the
consequence
it
begets
war
for
they
don
t
like
to
sell
their
own
and
steal
from
other
villages
who
going
west
from
the
lake
they
followed
a
very
zigzag
course
crossing
many
rivers
which
flow
into
the
lintipé
which
is
one
of
the
main
supplies
of
lake
nyassa
they
kept
to
the
north
of
the
fine
zalanyama
range
and
pushed
on
in
a
direction
all
the
while
a
state
of
fear
existed
in
regard
to
the
dreaded
mazitu
who
were
reported
to
be
making
forays
and
whom
livingstone
compared
to
the
highland
celts
in
the
twelfth
century
in
the
border
country
by
the
middle
of
december
they
had
reached
the
loangwa
and
crossed
it
in
search
of
food
christmas
day
was
spent
wretchedly
the
goats
having
been
stolen
and
livingstone
s
favourite
being
at
an
end
a
ridge
of
mountain
country
has
to
be
crossed
after
which
they
are
compelled
to
bear
to
the
east
in
search
of
food
which
has
become
very
scarce
again
and
all
the
party
are
suffering
the
last
day
of
is
sacred
to
some
new
resolutions
will
try
to
do
better
in
and
be
better
more
gentle
and
loving
and
may
the
almighty
to
whom
i
commit
my
way
bring
my
desires
to
pass
and
prosper
me
let
all
the
sin
of
be
blotted
out
for
jesus
may
he
who
was
full
of
grace
and
truth
impress
his
character
on
mine
grace
eagerness
to
show
favour
truth
truthfulness
sincerity
honour
for
his
mercy
s
the
year
opens
with
a
he
records
that
he
feels
always
hungry
and
is
constantly
dreaming
of
better
food
when
he
should
be
sleeping
on
the
he
takes
his
belt
up
three
holes
to
relieve
hunger
on
the
he
suffers
the
loss
of
his
poor
little
dog
chitané
to
which
he
was
greatly
attached
everywhere
it
is
famine
and
famine
prices
for
wretched
food
they
boil
grain
and
pretend
it
is
coffee
the
ground
is
all
sloppy
feet
constantly
wet
the
natives
are
living
on
mushrooms
and
leaves
then
comes
the
crowning
disaster
two
men
who
had
joined
the
expedition
deserted
and
absconded
with
the
medicine
chest
it
was
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
and
there
was
not
the
shadow
of
a
chance
of
recovering
it
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
lack
of
any
proper
medicines
to
counteract
the
fever
poison
was
a
main
contributory
cause
to
livingstone
s
serious
loss
of
health
i
felt
as
if
i
had
now
received
sentence
of
death
like
poor
bishop
mackenzie
he
writes
yet
even
in
the
hour
of
despair
he
searches
for
some
support
for
optimism
and
the
providential
order
which
he
knows
to
exist
this
may
turn
out
for
the
best
by
taking
away
a
source
of
suspicion
among
more
superstitious
people
further
on
january
he
remarks
that
an
incessant
hunger
teases
us
real
lasting
hunger
and
yet
next
day
it
was
a
case
of
four
hours
through
unbroken
dark
but
they
have
reached
the
chambezé
now
lean
and
starved
and
desperate
and
there
is
prospect
of
food
on
the
other
side
they
found
the
food
a
little
later
but
in
changing
my
dress
this
morning
i
was
frightened
at
my
own
the
expedition
made
a
lengthy
stay
with
the
chief
chitapangwa
who
on
the
whole
treated
them
well
and
sent
men
to
set
them
on
their
way
to
lake
tanganyika
the
same
steady
tramp
tramp
continues
always
we
seem
to
hear
what
isaac
taylor
described
as
the
forward
tread
which
means
getting
there
but
it
is
terrible
work
he
has
had
rheumatic
fever
again
and
no
medicine
on
march
he
writes
i
have
been
ill
of
fever
every
step
i
take
jars
in
the
chest
and
i
am
very
weak
i
can
scarcely
keep
in
the
march
though
formerly
i
was
always
first
i
have
a
constant
singing
in
the
ears
and
can
scarcely
hear
the
loud
tick
of
the
still
he
will
go
on
with
the
rest
and
at
last
on
the
first
day
of
april
they
are
at
tanganyika
or
as
it
is
called
at
the
southern
end
lake
liemba
it
has
been
good
marching
under
the
most
trying
conditions
the
veteran
traveller
has
gone
from
the
south
of
lake
nyassa
to
the
south
of
lake
tanganyika
in
six
months
ill
as
he
is
he
is
deeply
impressed
by
the
loveliness
of
the
scenery
mountains
running
up
to
feet
surround
the
southern
portion
and
there
embosomed
in
rocks
reposes
the
lake
peacefully
in
the
huge
again
he
writes
it
lies
in
a
deep
basin
whose
sides
are
nearly
perpendicular
but
covered
well
with
trees
the
rocks
which
appear
are
bright
red
argillaceous
schist
the
trees
at
present
all
green
down
some
of
these
rocks
come
beautiful
cascades
and
buffaloes
elephants
and
antelopes
wander
and
graze
on
the
more
level
it
is
an
enchanted
country
but
the
getting
there
has
in
the
absence
of
medicines
nearly
killed
him
i
feel
deeply
thankful
at
having
got
so
far
i
am
excessively
weak
and
can
not
walk
without
tottering
and
have
constant
singing
in
the
head
the
highest
will
lead
me
after
a
few
days
spent
at
the
lake
livingstone
s
illness
assumes
a
most
alarming
form
he
has
a
fit
of
insensibility
finds
himself
floundering
outside
the
hut
and
unable
to
get
in
and
finally
falls
back
heavily
on
his
head
the
boys
carried
him
in
but
hours
passed
before
he
could
recognise
where
he
was
he
is
a
little
better
a
fortnight
later
and
anxious
to
move
on
but
whither
he
had
intended
to
follow
the
lake
to
the
but
the
road
seems
barred
by
the
mazitu
who
are
out
for
plunder
he
has
heard
of
lake
moero
which
lies
to
the
west
some
two
hundred
or
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
is
it
not
possible
that
this
lake
may
be
the
common
source
of
the
congo
and
the
nile
the
geographical
problem
is
most
persistent
and
he
can
not
be
satisfied
to
leave
lake
moero
unexplored
on
the
first
day
s
march
he
has
another
fit
of
insensibility
but
this
does
not
constitute
an
argument
for
delay
he
reached
the
village
of
a
chief
chitimba
only
to
find
that
the
country
between
him
and
lake
moero
is
the
scene
of
a
small
war
which
would
involve
a
long
détour
round
the
disturbed
he
decides
to
wait
events
which
turns
out
to
be
a
tedious
business
but
the
arabs
are
kind
to
him
and
the
enforced
leisure
is
probably
beneficial
his
diary
is
full
of
descriptions
of
the
cruelties
inflicted
by
the
in
all
he
was
detained
at
chitimba
s
village
nearly
three
months
and
a
half
in
his
onward
march
he
visits
the
famous
nsama
with
whom
the
war
has
been
waged
and
is
again
laid
up
with
illness
in
that
neighbourhood
after
this
he
crosses
the
chisera
and
the
choma
and
then
ascends
the
high
lands
between
the
rivers
and
the
northern
part
of
the
lake
it
is
exhilarating
travelling
here
for
livingstone
is
always
pleasantly
excited
by
beautiful
and
hilly
scenery
which
brings
back
memories
of
scotland
but
alas
the
long
line
of
slaves
and
carriers
is
a
frequent
incident
in
the
march
on
the
of
november
he
reaches
lake
moero
which
seems
of
goodly
size
and
is
flanked
by
ranges
of
mountains
on
the
east
and
there
he
sleeps
in
a
fisherman
s
hut
for
the
lake
abounds
in
fish
the
fishermen
enumerating
varieties
the
end
of
november
finds
him
at
the
town
of
casembe
where
he
meets
an
arab
trader
mohamad
bogharib
with
an
immense
number
of
slaves
who
gives
him
a
meal
the
first
honey
and
sugar
he
had
tasted
for
fourteen
months
and
is
useful
to
him
in
many
ways
the
chief
also
is
civil
to
livingstone
but
has
been
guilty
of
hateful
barbarities
as
the
mutilated
arms
and
ears
of
many
of
his
people
bear
witness
livingstone
looks
with
disgust
on
the
executioner
who
carries
sword
and
scissors
for
his
horrible
work
the
people
generally
are
more
savage
than
any
he
has
seen
the
results
of
extended
explorations
of
lake
moero
lasting
for
some
months
are
set
forth
in
a
despatch
to
lord
clarendon
dated
the
of
december
from
this
despatch
we
can
see
that
livingstone
had
been
misled
by
a
similarity
of
name
to
imagine
that
lake
bemba
of
which
he
had
heard
years
before
was
the
same
as
lake
liemba
he
now
knows
that
lake
liemba
is
only
the
southern
portion
of
lake
tanganyika
and
that
lake
bemba
is
the
lake
otherwise
called
lake
bangweolo
and
that
on
his
northern
travels
from
lake
nyassa
when
he
crossed
the
river
chambezé
he
had
been
less
than
a
hundred
miles
from
this
latter
lake
and
might
have
saved
himself
many
a
hundred
miles
of
trudging
had
he
explored
it
first
of
all
he
had
discovered
also
that
a
great
river
the
luapula
flows
from
lake
bangweolo
into
the
south
of
lake
moero
and
that
at
the
north
the
waters
flow
out
in
what
is
called
the
river
lualaba
he
is
uncertain
in
his
own
mind
what
this
great
river
lualaba
is
and
whither
it
goes
it
may
be
the
nile
it
seems
more
probable
that
it
is
the
congo
it
may
flow
into
the
northern
portion
of
lake
tanganyika
or
it
may
flow
away
to
the
livingstone
is
assured
by
the
natives
that
lake
bangweolo
is
only
ten
days
distant
but
he
adds
i
am
so
tired
of
exploration
without
a
word
from
home
or
anywhere
else
for
two
years
that
i
must
go
to
ujiji
on
tanganyika
for
letters
before
doing
anything
else
besides
there
is
another
reason
i
have
no
he
is
satirical
on
the
subject
of
the
published
maps
one
of
which
tacks
on
miles
to
lake
nyassa
and
another
makes
a
river
the
new
zambesi
flow
feet
up
hill
i
have
walked
over
both
these
mental
abortions
and
did
not
know
that
i
was
walking
on
water
till
i
saw
them
in
the
the
year
finds
him
still
interested
in
lake
moero
his
new
year
s
prayer
is
if
i
am
to
die
this
year
prepare
me
for
it
was
towards
the
end
of
march
that
the
idea
of
going
south
and
exploring
lake
bangweolo
took
hold
on
him
his
reason
was
that
at
least
two
more
months
must
be
passed
at
lake
moero
before
a
passage
could
be
made
to
ujiji
there
were
many
difficulties
in
the
way
notably
that
his
stores
were
nearly
done
and
he
could
not
give
presents
to
chiefs
on
the
way
what
was
more
serious
was
that
those
on
whose
help
he
counted
were
in
open
revolt
against
his
plan
mohamad
bogharib
who
intended
to
accompany
him
to
ujiji
was
incensed
at
livingstone
for
making
a
proposal
so
mad
and
the
latter
expresses
the
fear
that
he
must
give
up
lake
bangweolo
for
the
present
next
day
however
he
is
bent
on
going
but
his
own
carriers
have
been
corrupted
by
the
arabs
and
refuse
to
accompany
him
only
five
of
his
men
remain
loyal
but
livingstone
s
blood
is
up
now
and
he
starts
out
at
the
head
of
this
meagre
escort
to
find
lake
bemba
or
bangweolo
i
did
not
blame
them
very
severely
in
my
own
mind
for
absconding
he
writes
they
were
tired
of
tramping
and
so
verily
am
they
might
well
resent
livingstone
s
decision
for
at
the
time
it
was
taken
they
were
at
the
north
end
of
lake
moero
where
livingstone
had
gone
to
look
at
lualaba
examine
the
country
and
draw
his
conclusions
as
to
whether
this
great
river
was
the
congo
or
the
nile
the
way
to
tanganyika
and
ujiji
was
now
open
and
this
sudden
turn
south
was
almost
more
than
flesh
and
blood
could
stand
however
the
leader
was
obdurate
and
early
in
may
with
his
faithful
few
he
is
back
at
casembe
s
to
the
south
of
moero
with
his
mind
fully
made
up
for
bangweolo
again
there
were
tedious
delays
and
it
is
the
second
week
in
june
before
he
is
definitely
off
for
the
south
a
month
s
travelling
brings
him
to
lake
bangweolo
a
babisa
traveller
asked
him
why
he
had
come
so
far
and
he
answered
that
he
wished
to
make
the
country
and
people
better
known
to
the
rest
of
the
world
that
we
were
all
children
of
one
father
and
that
he
was
anxious
that
we
should
know
each
other
better
and
that
friendly
visits
should
be
made
in
safety
he
began
exploring
the
islands
of
the
lake
it
was
bitterly
cold
on
one
of
them
and
the
shed
where
he
slept
was
decidedly
airy
but
he
tells
us
that
he
was
soon
asleep
and
dreamed
that
he
had
apartments
in
mivart
s
hotel
at
the
end
of
july
he
started
back
and
at
kizinga
he
deviated
from
his
former
route
and
struck
out
to
the
north
for
the
kalongosi
river
all
goes
well
and
by
the
first
of
november
be
is
back
again
at
the
north
of
moero
preparing
to
march
to
ujiji
and
intently
preoccupied
with
the
problem
of
the
nile
the
men
who
had
deserted
him
when
he
went
south
are
now
pleading
to
be
taken
back
he
reflects
that
more
enlightened
people
often
take
advantage
of
men
in
similar
circumstances
and
adds
characteristically
i
have
faults
so
all
the
runaways
are
reinstated
the
expedition
would
have
got
away
now
without
further
delay
but
that
the
slave
raids
of
mohamad
bogharib
s
men
roused
the
countryside
against
him
and
livingstone
found
himself
at
the
very
centre
of
a
small
war
and
literally
in
the
zone
of
fire
stockades
were
hastily
erected
and
the
perpetrators
of
the
outrage
had
to
stand
a
siege
horrible
scenes
were
witnessed
and
livingstone
comments
on
the
miseries
which
this
devilish
traffic
entails
the
country
is
now
very
disturbed
and
unsafe
and
it
is
not
till
december
that
a
start
can
be
made
waller
describes
the
motley
group
that
now
set
out
for
tanganyika
mohamad
and
his
friends
a
gang
of
unyamwezi
and
strings
of
wretched
slaves
yolked
together
in
their
heavy
some
carry
ivory
others
copper
or
food
for
the
march
whilst
hope
and
fear
misery
and
villainy
may
be
read
off
the
various
livingstone
is
now
an
actual
of
a
slave
march
the
slaves
constantly
escape
sickness
and
accidents
pursue
the
miserable
cavalcade
and
make
progress
slow
food
for
so
many
mouths
is
difficult
to
obtain
christmas
day
passes
in
a
land
of
scarcity
the
weather
is
very
damp
and
cheerless
and
on
new
year
s
day
livingstone
as
he
says
got
wet
through
once
too
often
yet
he
is
so
anxious
to
be
on
the
far
side
of
the
lofuko
that
he
wades
through
though
it
is
waist
deep
and
very
cold
this
is
the
last
straw
he
breaks
down
utterly
is
very
ill
all
over
can
not
walk
pneumonia
of
right
lung
and
i
cough
all
day
illustration
the
tragedy
of
central
africa
and
all
night
sputa
rust
of
iron
and
bloody
distressing
he
chronicles
the
illusions
that
come
and
go
sees
himself
lying
dead
on
the
way
to
ujiji
and
all
the
letters
waiting
for
him
useless
it
seems
as
if
he
is
near
the
end
mohamad
bogharib
constructs
a
kind
of
litter
for
the
helpless
veteran
and
in
this
litter
he
is
carried
forward
four
hours
a
day
it
is
the
best
that
can
be
done
but
livingstone
tells
of
the
pain
he
endured
as
he
was
jolted
along
sometimes
through
steep
ravines
and
sometimes
over
volcanic
tufa
the
feet
of
the
carriers
being
at
times
hurt
with
thorns
and
the
sun
beating
down
on
livingstone
s
face
and
head
which
in
his
weakness
he
could
not
even
shelter
with
a
bunch
of
leaves
for
six
endless
weeks
the
sufferer
was
borne
onward
thus
and
on
february
all
that
is
left
of
him
is
deposited
on
the
shore
of
lake
tanganyika
and
canoes
are
sought
to
transport
the
party
up
the
lake
to
ujiji
it
was
stormy
weather
on
the
lake
and
the
canoes
had
to
creep
along
the
western
shore
from
village
to
village
patience
was
never
needed
more
than
now
writes
the
sick
man
in
his
extremity
then
across
the
lake
to
the
east
and
at
last
march
the
heroic
traveller
reaches
his
goal
and
does
actually
stand
for
the
first
time
in
the
streets
of
ujiji
he
had
fixed
so
many
hopes
on
this
arab
settlement
and
had
lived
for
so
long
on
the
anticipation
of
letters
and
journals
stores
and
medicines
that
the
disappointment
awaiting
him
was
heartrending
he
had
reached
a
den
of
thieves
the
vilest
he
had
ever
known
his
stores
were
plundered
only
eighteen
pieces
of
cloth
out
of
eighty
remained
and
what
was
harder
to
bear
only
one
old
letter
out
of
all
that
had
been
sent
to
him
as
for
the
medicines
he
is
told
they
are
at
unyanyembe
thirteen
days
to
the
east
he
knew
quite
well
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
thwart
him
and
if
possible
to
drive
him
out
of
the
country
or
compass
his
death
he
was
fighting
the
slave
trade
and
was
ringed
around
by
cruel
and
unscrupulous
enemies
whose
dark
deeds
had
only
him
to
fear
he
is
almost
beaten
in
the
unequal
strife
almost
but
never
quite
no
man
was
ever
yet
quite
beaten
who
is
as
sure
of
christ
as
he
was
he
has
one
thing
to
rely
on
as
he
said
before
the
word
of
a
gentleman
of
the
strictest
honour
and
it
is
enough
so
he
will
remain
and
outwit
the
if
he
can
and
yet
it
is
a
misnomer
to
call
it
a
trade
it
is
not
a
trade
but
a
system
of
consecutive
he
did
not
know
though
he
suspected
how
helpless
he
was
in
the
hands
of
the
arabs
his
bitter
cry
could
not
reach
england
forty
letters
he
wrote
and
paid
handsomely
for
their
delivery
but
the
arabs
took
care
they
should
never
reach
the
coast
he
was
literally
cut
off
in
the
interior
he
heard
nothing
from
europe
and
europe
heard
nothing
of
him
a
few
weeks
at
ujiji
were
enough
then
all
unfit
as
he
was
he
starts
out
again
for
the
country
in
the
the
land
of
the
manyuema
and
the
great
river
lualaba
the
direction
of
which
it
is
his
main
purpose
now
to
determine
he
still
believes
it
is
the
nile
chapter
viii
when
livingstone
crossed
tanganyika
again
to
the
west
and
disappeared
into
the
new
country
he
certainly
did
not
propose
to
himself
more
than
an
eight
or
nine
months
absence
in
reality
he
left
ujiji
on
july
and
saw
it
no
more
until
october
for
two
years
and
a
quarter
he
wandered
on
while
the
great
world
believed
him
to
be
dead
and
perhaps
if
we
had
to
name
one
period
of
his
life
which
was
more
poignant
and
more
fruitful
than
any
other
it
was
this
for
out
of
its
agonies
a
new
hope
was
born
for
humanity
his
health
returns
somewhat
as
he
goes
on
though
many
signs
remind
him
that
he
is
not
the
man
he
was
he
is
only
but
he
is
worn
out
with
hardship
and
privation
he
can
not
walk
without
panting
for
breath
his
cheeks
are
hollow
and
his
teeth
are
broken
or
have
fallen
out
from
trying
to
masticate
hard
and
sticky
food
if
you
expect
a
kiss
from
me
he
writes
to
his
daughter
agnes
you
must
take
it
through
a
the
of
september
sees
him
at
bambarré
the
capital
of
the
manyuema
country
noting
with
thankfulness
that
as
he
perseveres
his
strength
increases
in
front
of
him
is
the
luamo
river
flowing
west
to
its
confluence
with
the
lualaba
which
again
is
not
far
distant
he
might
have
fulfilled
his
ambition
to
navigate
the
lualaba
now
but
could
get
no
canoes
all
are
our
enemies
and
so
returned
reluctantly
to
bambarré
it
was
from
bambarré
that
he
wrote
two
letters
they
were
probably
posted
months
later
which
actually
got
through
the
arab
cordon
and
eventually
reached
their
owners
one
was
to
his
son
tom
he
tells
of
his
hopes
to
go
down
the
lualaba
but
he
has
frightful
ulcers
on
his
feet
from
wading
in
another
to
sir
thomas
maclear
which
is
more
explicit
as
to
his
plans
i
have
to
go
down
and
see
where
the
two
arms
unite
the
lost
city
meroe
ought
to
be
there
then
get
back
to
ujiji
to
get
a
supply
of
goods
which
i
have
ordered
from
zanzibar
turn
bankrupt
after
i
secure
them
and
let
my
creditors
catch
me
if
they
can
as
i
finish
up
by
going
outside
and
south
of
all
the
sources
so
that
i
may
be
sure
none
will
cut
me
out
and
say
he
found
other
sources
south
of
mine
i
have
still
a
seriously
long
task
before
to
his
daughter
agnes
whose
courage
he
never
failed
to
praise
he
writes
the
death
knell
of
american
slavery
was
rung
by
a
woman
s
hand
we
great
say
stowe
exaggerated
from
what
i
have
seen
of
slavery
i
say
exaggeration
is
a
simple
impossibility
i
go
with
the
sailor
who
on
seeing
said
if
the
devil
don
t
catch
those
fellows
we
might
as
well
have
no
devil
at
after
christmas
he
goes
away
to
the
north
and
discovers
the
chanya
range
marching
through
rank
jungle
and
suffering
much
from
fever
and
choleraic
symptoms
he
turns
south
again
and
on
the
of
february
goes
into
winter
quarters
at
mamohela
mohamad
is
still
with
him
but
goes
off
at
this
stage
in
search
of
ivory
the
entries
in
his
diary
are
now
few
but
on
june
the
winter
season
is
evidently
over
and
he
proposes
to
start
once
again
for
the
lualaba
once
more
however
he
has
to
reckon
with
a
revolt
of
his
men
who
desert
with
the
exception
of
three
among
whom
are
the
susi
and
chumah
the
path
this
time
is
to
the
it
is
difficult
and
hazardous
but
the
situation
is
relieved
by
the
timely
arrival
of
mohamad
bogharib
it
was
well
for
livingstone
was
at
the
end
of
his
strength
flooded
rivers
breast
and
neck
deep
had
to
be
crossed
and
the
mud
was
his
feet
failed
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
irritable
eating
ulcers
fastened
on
both
in
indescribable
pain
he
limped
back
to
this
was
on
july
for
the
next
eighty
days
he
was
a
prisoner
in
his
hut
he
could
do
nothing
but
think
illustration
i
read
the
bible
through
four
times
whilst
i
was
in
read
the
bible
and
pray
he
read
the
bible
through
four
times
during
his
stay
in
the
manyuema
country
he
was
fascinated
by
the
personality
of
moses
and
his
connection
with
the
nile
and
thinks
favourably
of
the
legend
that
associates
him
with
the
lost
city
meroe
at
the
junction
of
the
two
rivers
lualaba
he
meditates
tenderly
on
the
stratagem
of
the
old
nile
hiding
its
head
so
cunningly
and
baffling
so
many
human
efforts
one
of
his
resources
is
the
soko
a
kind
of
gorilla
often
made
captive
it
is
physically
repulsive
to
him
but
it
interests
him
as
a
naturalist
and
later
on
he
becomes
possessed
of
one
which
he
pets
and
proposes
to
take
back
to
europe
when
most
helpless
he
sketches
out
his
future
and
in
imagination
names
certain
lakes
and
rivers
after
old
english
friends
and
benefactors
palmerston
webb
and
young
and
one
lake
after
the
great
lincoln
on
the
of
october
he
is
able
for
the
first
time
to
crawl
out
of
his
hut
on
the
he
makes
this
significant
entry
in
his
journal
in
this
journey
i
have
endeavoured
to
follow
with
unswerving
fidelity
the
line
of
duty
all
the
hardship
hunger
and
toil
were
met
with
the
full
conviction
that
i
was
right
in
persevering
to
make
a
complete
work
of
the
exploration
of
the
sources
of
the
nile
the
prospect
of
death
in
pursuing
what
i
knew
to
be
right
did
not
make
me
veer
to
one
side
or
the
never
had
any
man
a
better
right
to
use
such
words
he
is
waiting
now
for
the
arrival
of
syde
bin
habib
dugumbé
and
others
who
are
bringing
him
letters
and
medicines
from
ujiji
months
pass
and
there
is
no
sign
of
them
he
is
heartsick
and
weary
with
the
intolerable
delay
the
one
excitement
is
in
the
shedding
of
blood
every
day
has
its
story
of
horrors
and
he
can
bear
it
no
longer
but
there
are
to
be
darker
tragedies
yet
before
he
escapes
out
of
the
manyuema
country
the
year
dawns
o
father
help
me
to
finish
this
work
to
thy
it
was
february
before
the
men
arrived
who
were
bringing
letters
and
stores
for
him
but
alas
only
one
letter
reached
and
forty
are
the
men
too
have
been
corrupted
by
the
arabs
and
refuse
to
go
north
with
him
he
is
again
outwitted
by
his
cunning
foes
weary
days
of
bargaining
follow
and
at
last
terms
are
arranged
the
expedition
starts
and
on
march
livingstone
is
at
nyangwé
on
the
bank
of
the
lualaba
the
furthest
point
westward
that
he
was
to
reach
at
this
time
he
finds
the
lualaba
here
a
mighty
river
yards
livingstone
was
to
learn
to
his
cost
that
the
men
who
had
been
sent
up
country
to
him
ostensibly
to
help
him
on
his
way
were
his
worst
enemies
they
poisoned
the
minds
of
the
manyuema
against
him
they
stirred
up
strife
and
were
guilty
of
every
kind
of
crime
all
livingstone
s
efforts
to
get
canoes
for
exploring
the
river
were
neutralised
by
them
though
he
afterwards
saw
in
this
the
hand
of
god
for
his
deliverance
for
other
canoes
were
lost
in
the
rapids
we
don
t
always
know
the
dangers
we
are
guided
we
now
reach
the
event
which
was
the
climax
of
livingstone
s
moral
sufferings
and
which
when
known
in
europe
sent
a
thrill
of
horror
through
the
nations
which
had
heard
of
the
lesser
agonies
of
the
slave
traffic
with
comparative
indifference
on
the
of
june
one
of
syde
bin
habib
s
slaves
named
manilla
set
fire
to
eight
or
ten
villages
alleging
an
old
debt
by
way
of
an
excuse
he
then
made
with
other
tribes
which
angered
dugumbé
and
his
followers
who
planned
revenge
the
of
july
was
a
lovely
summer
day
and
about
people
came
together
for
the
market
livingstone
was
strolling
round
observing
the
life
in
the
market
place
when
three
of
dugumbé
s
men
opened
fire
upon
the
assembled
crowd
and
another
small
troop
began
to
shoot
down
the
women
as
they
fled
to
the
canoes
on
the
river
so
many
canoes
were
pushed
off
at
once
down
the
creek
that
they
got
jammed
and
the
murderers
on
the
bank
poured
volley
after
volley
into
them
numbers
of
the
victims
sprang
into
the
water
and
swam
out
into
the
river
many
were
hit
and
sank
others
were
drowned
canoes
capsized
and
their
occupants
were
lost
the
arabs
reckoned
the
dead
at
four
hundred
and
even
then
the
men
who
had
tasted
blood
continued
the
awful
butchery
and
fired
village
after
village
no
one
will
ever
know
writes
livingstone
the
exact
loss
on
this
bright
sultry
summer
morning
it
gave
me
the
impression
of
being
in
dugumbé
protested
his
innocence
and
helped
to
save
some
who
were
drowning
but
it
is
clear
that
livingstone
in
his
heart
accuses
him
of
complicity
he
counted
twelve
burning
villages
and
on
the
next
day
sees
as
many
as
seventeen
the
open
murder
perpetrated
on
hundreds
of
unsuspecting
women
fills
me
with
unspeakable
it
felt
to
me
like
gehenna
he
writes
later
and
the
nightmare
never
left
him
afterwards
i
can
not
stay
here
in
agony
he
adds
and
on
the
he
starts
back
for
ujiji
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
those
who
had
every
reason
to
desire
that
he
should
not
go
away
and
publish
the
story
the
atrocious
wickedness
of
the
arabs
was
illustration
the
manyuema
ambuscade
that
they
demoralised
their
slaves
and
trained
them
to
perpetrate
these
butcheries
of
natives
and
then
excused
themselves
on
the
ground
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
crime
the
homeward
march
lay
through
miles
of
villages
all
burned
and
it
was
impossible
to
convince
the
wretched
survivors
that
he
himself
had
not
been
guilty
ambushes
were
laid
to
murder
him
and
his
party
a
large
spear
almost
grazed
my
another
spear
missed
him
by
only
a
foot
two
of
his
men
were
slain
a
huge
tree
had
been
loosened
at
the
roots
and
almost
fell
upon
him
three
times
in
one
day
he
escaped
death
by
a
hair
so
impressed
were
his
people
that
they
cried
peace
peace
you
will
finish
your
work
in
spite
of
he
took
it
as
an
omen
and
gave
thanks
to
the
almighty
preserver
of
for
five
hours
he
ran
the
gauntlet
perfectly
indifferent
whether
i
were
killed
or
the
march
was
pursued
in
great
suffering
through
august
and
september
and
on
into
october
once
he
says
he
felt
like
dying
on
his
feet
he
was
profoundly
shaken
and
depressed
the
infamous
traders
succeeded
but
he
had
failed
he
alone
and
experienced
worry
thwarting
baffling
when
almost
in
sight
of
the
end
for
which
i
on
the
of
october
reduced
to
a
skeleton
a
mere
ruckle
of
bones
he
arrived
at
ujiji
shereef
who
had
custody
of
his
goods
had
sold
them
all
off
shereef
says
livingstone
is
a
moral
little
wonder
that
he
feels
like
the
man
in
the
parable
who
fell
among
thieves
only
alas
there
was
no
good
samaritan
so
he
felt
but
this
time
he
was
mistaken
when
my
spirits
were
at
their
lowest
ebb
the
good
samaritan
was
close
at
no
part
of
his
amazing
story
is
better
known
on
the
morning
of
october
susi
came
running
to
him
at
the
top
of
his
speed
and
gasped
out
an
englishman
i
see
him
a
caravan
was
approaching
with
the
american
flag
flying
over
it
a
few
minutes
and
the
stranger
was
in
front
of
him
holding
out
his
hand
with
the
words
dr
livingstone
i
presume
it
was
henry
morton
stanley
who
had
undertaken
to
find
him
alive
or
dead
he
had
engaged
to
do
so
two
years
before
and
he
had
kept
his
word
chapter
ix
in
the
middle
of
october
when
livingstone
was
at
bambarré
in
quest
of
the
lualaba
stanley
was
travelling
from
madrid
to
paris
in
response
to
an
urgent
telegram
from
james
gordon
bennett
of
the
york
where
do
you
think
livingstone
is
was
bennett
s
query
when
stanley
arrived
the
latter
confessed
his
ignorance
the
world
in
general
seemed
to
be
content
to
go
on
regardless
of
livingstone
s
fate
nobody
knew
for
certain
whether
he
was
alive
or
dead
bennett
approached
the
question
as
a
journalist
to
find
livingstone
was
the
most
sensational
feat
that
could
be
performed
bennett
probably
underrated
his
own
motive
of
humanity
but
he
felt
that
david
livingstone
was
good
copy
and
that
if
he
were
discovered
the
world
would
ring
with
the
enterprise
of
the
great
paper
with
which
he
was
honourably
associated
his
instructions
to
stanley
were
of
the
simplest
spare
no
expense
spend
all
the
money
you
want
only
find
by
a
curious
arrangement
stanley
was
first
of
all
to
make
a
grand
tour
through
constantinople
palestine
egypt
india
that
is
why
he
did
not
cross
to
zanzibar
till
the
beginning
of
livingstone
might
have
reappeared
in
the
interval
but
there
was
no
sign
accordingly
stanley
organised
an
imposing
expedition
of
nearly
persons
in
five
caravans
with
all
kinds
of
stores
necessary
and
luxurious
and
made
for
the
interior
by
way
of
unyanyembe
there
he
himself
all
but
perished
of
fever
and
afterwards
escaped
by
a
hand
being
made
the
victim
of
a
war
between
the
arabs
and
the
natives
however
he
stuck
to
his
errand
and
as
we
have
seen
arrived
in
ujiji
and
greeted
livingstone
just
when
the
latter
was
most
in
need
of
the
kind
of
illustration
stanley
finds
livingstone
cheer
and
aid
that
stanley
had
brought
five
years
had
passed
since
livingstone
had
had
news
of
the
outer
world
and
even
now
it
is
a
question
whether
stanley
s
story
to
livingstone
or
livingstone
s
to
stanley
was
the
greater
tale
stanley
brought
news
of
the
war
of
general
grant
s
presidency
of
the
electric
cables
laid
and
what
touched
livingstone
deeply
of
a
vote
of
for
supplies
to
him
by
the
government
so
he
was
not
entirely
forgotten
livingstone
s
story
was
told
by
degrees
a
story
of
which
stanley
could
be
left
to
estimate
the
heroism
and
miraculous
endurance
never
before
or
since
has
such
a
story
of
one
lone
man
s
achievement
been
told
to
any
listener
this
was
the
man
stanley
had
found
this
was
the
man
he
was
now
to
save
from
despair
and
collapse
you
have
brought
me
new
life
livingstone
kept
saying
and
it
was
true
in
every
sense
for
stanley
had
brought
him
news
and
food
and
medicine
and
comfort
and
above
all
companionship
his
recovery
was
remarkable
he
began
to
enjoy
every
luxury
provided
for
him
he
revelled
in
the
descriptions
of
the
history
of
the
memorable
five
years
as
stanley
described
it
in
graphic
fashion
he
read
and
his
home
letters
he
luxuriated
in
clothes
new
and
clean
and
warm
the
imagination
loves
to
dwell
on
this
oasis
in
the
desert
of
his
last
years
he
was
supremely
happy
full
of
laughter
and
anecdote
above
all
full
of
gratitude
to
the
resourceful
and
admiring
friend
who
had
dropped
from
the
clouds
to
relieve
his
solitude
and
brace
his
soul
for
the
final
exploits
it
was
stanley
s
own
testimony
that
this
meeting
and
the
cheerful
days
that
followed
seemed
to
take
ten
years
off
livingstone
s
age
and
bring
back
the
air
of
youth
to
his
face
and
figure
they
planned
together
an
exploration
of
the
northern
end
of
lake
tanganyika
it
was
a
picnic
or
so
livingstone
called
it
and
it
was
carried
out
in
that
spirit
the
old
explorer
had
always
been
convinced
that
lake
tanganyika
contributed
its
waters
to
the
nile
they
found
but
one
river
at
the
northern
end
and
that
river
flowed
not
even
so
he
was
not
wholly
convinced
that
his
theory
was
unsound
there
were
incidents
in
the
journey
that
revealed
to
the
younger
man
livingstone
s
patience
and
forbearance
and
the
secret
of
his
unique
power
in
gentleness
and
the
forgiving
spirit
the
impression
made
was
never
effaced
of
the
picture
of
livingstone
drawn
by
stanley
s
sympathetic
and
accomplished
hand
we
shall
have
more
to
say
in
the
final
chapter
meanwhile
we
only
record
that
stanley
succeeded
beyond
all
hopes
in
the
first
part
of
his
mission
and
as
conspicuously
failed
in
the
second
the
first
part
was
to
find
livingstone
and
minister
to
his
needs
there
is
no
manner
of
doubt
that
this
mission
was
well
and
truly
performed
stanley
s
repeated
acts
of
generosity
brought
the
tears
to
livingstone
s
eyes
and
this
cold
northerner
as
he
called
himself
was
moved
beyond
words
from
stanley
he
also
received
abundance
of
stores
and
medicines
as
well
as
a
company
of
carriers
sent
back
to
him
eventually
from
zanzibar
but
as
to
the
second
part
of
the
mission
which
was
to
persuade
livingstone
to
go
home
at
once
where
honours
and
fortune
awaited
him
and
his
nearest
and
dearest
were
yearning
to
see
him
again
in
this
stanley
had
no
success
to
return
and
go
wearily
over
many
of
his
old
tracks
to
dare
once
again
the
perils
of
fever
the
enmity
of
the
slave
trader
and
the
ignorant
antagonism
of
savage
peoples
this
was
the
alternative
programme
and
he
was
resolute
to
carry
it
out
his
problem
was
not
yet
fully
solved
and
if
he
could
help
it
he
would
not
carry
mere
theories
back
to
england
after
five
years
of
wandering
and
exile
when
his
daughter
agnes
wrote
much
as
i
wish
you
to
come
home
i
had
rather
that
you
finished
your
work
to
your
own
satisfaction
than
return
merely
to
gratify
me
he
writes
proudly
in
his
journal
rightly
and
nobly
said
my
darling
nannie
vanity
whispers
pretty
loudly
she
is
a
chip
of
the
old
my
blessing
on
her
and
all
the
the
plan
then
formed
between
the
two
travellers
was
to
return
together
to
unyanyembe
where
stanley
had
stores
waiting
the
latter
would
then
push
on
rapidly
to
zanzibar
and
send
back
carriers
for
livingstone
s
new
expedition
with
these
the
veteran
proposed
to
return
to
a
final
examination
of
the
sources
of
the
great
rivers
clear
up
the
points
still
in
dispute
and
then
turn
his
face
home
they
set
out
together
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
arrived
after
seven
weeks
travelling
at
unyanyembe
on
the
march
is
prosaically
recorded
by
livingstone
the
most
frequent
entries
concern
stanley
s
repeated
attacks
of
fever
occasionally
he
was
so
weak
that
he
had
to
be
carried
but
for
the
tireless
ministration
of
his
great
companion
and
the
cheering
effect
of
his
presence
which
was
worth
many
doses
of
quinine
stanley
might
easily
have
succumbed
they
reached
their
destination
only
to
find
that
thieves
had
been
active
as
usual
and
that
both
livingstone
s
and
stanley
s
stores
had
been
extensively
plundered
there
was
enough
left
however
to
make
livingstone
feel
rich
i
am
quite
set
up
and
as
soon
as
he
can
send
me
men
not
slaves
from
the
coast
i
go
to
my
work
with
a
fair
prospect
of
finishing
the
two
friends
remained
together
nearly
a
month
at
unyanyembe
letters
and
parcels
arrived
livingstone
rejoices
in
four
flannel
shirts
from
agnes
and
two
pairs
of
fine
english
boots
from
a
friend
despatches
have
to
be
written
articles
for
the
york
and
grateful
letters
to
many
american
and
english
friends
all
of
which
stanley
will
take
with
him
at
last
on
march
the
time
has
come
to
say
livingstone
s
entry
in
his
diary
is
characteristic
mr
stanley
leaves
i
commit
to
his
care
my
journal
sealed
with
five
seals
the
impressions
on
them
are
those
of
an
american
gold
coin
anna
and
and
cake
of
paint
with
royal
arms
positively
not
to
be
all
that
one
man
naturally
reticent
and
reserved
could
say
of
the
limitless
kindness
shown
by
stanley
and
the
noble
interest
taken
by
america
livingstone
expressed
in
his
private
letters
it
is
to
stanley
s
picturesque
pen
that
we
owe
the
description
of
the
final
parting
and
we
may
well
quote
a
few
sentences
from
it
my
days
seem
to
have
been
spent
in
an
elysian
field
otherwise
why
should
i
so
keenly
regret
the
near
approach
of
the
parting
hour
have
i
not
been
battered
by
successive
fevers
prostrate
with
agony
day
after
day
lately
have
i
not
raved
and
stormed
in
madness
have
i
not
clenched
my
fists
in
fury
and
fought
with
the
wild
strength
of
despair
when
in
delirium
yet
i
regret
to
surrender
the
pleasure
i
have
felt
in
this
man
s
society
though
so
dearly
purchased
march
we
had
a
sad
breakfast
together
i
could
not
eat
my
heart
was
too
full
neither
did
my
companion
seem
to
have
an
appetite
we
found
something
to
do
which
kept
us
longer
together
at
eight
o
clock
i
was
not
gone
and
i
had
thought
to
have
been
off
at
but
the
final
parting
must
be
faced
the
doctor
will
walk
out
a
little
way
with
his
friend
and
start
him
on
his
journey
the
carriers
were
in
lively
mood
singing
on
the
march
the
two
friends
walked
side
by
side
stanley
searching
livingstone
s
features
to
impress
every
detail
on
his
memory
at
last
he
halts
now
my
dear
doctor
the
best
friends
must
part
you
have
come
far
enough
let
me
beg
of
you
to
turn
well
livingstone
replied
i
will
say
this
of
you
you
have
done
what
few
men
could
do
far
better
than
some
great
travellers
i
know
and
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
god
guide
you
safe
home
and
bless
you
my
and
may
god
bring
you
safe
back
to
us
all
my
dear
friend
farewell
farewell
livingstone
turned
away
did
his
heart
forebode
that
this
was
the
last
white
face
he
would
ever
see
the
last
white
hand
he
would
ever
press
did
he
feel
that
he
was
turning
his
back
for
ever
on
home
and
rest
and
freedom
just
when
a
dip
in
the
path
would
hide
the
returning
exile
finally
from
view
stanley
turned
to
take
one
more
look
the
old
man
in
grey
clothes
was
still
there
he
too
turned
round
he
was
standing
near
the
gate
of
kwihaha
with
his
servants
near
him
i
waved
a
handkerchief
to
him
and
he
responded
by
lifting
his
this
was
on
march
on
march
at
a
spot
agreed
upon
susi
and
hamaydah
found
stanley
and
delivered
to
him
a
letter
signed
by
livingstone
in
which
the
latter
gives
him
a
scotch
counsel
to
put
a
stout
heart
to
a
stey
brae
rejoices
that
stanley
s
fever
has
assumed
the
intermittent
or
safe
form
and
concludes
i
feel
comfortable
in
commending
you
to
the
guardianship
of
the
good
lord
and
father
of
two
days
later
it
was
livingstone
s
birthday
and
his
diary
reminds
us
that
though
this
new
friend
has
come
and
gone
there
is
one
who
is
with
him
always
even
to
the
end
of
the
world
my
birthday
my
jesus
my
king
my
life
my
all
i
again
dedicate
my
whole
self
to
thee
accept
me
and
grant
o
gracious
father
that
ere
this
year
is
gone
i
may
finish
my
work
in
jesus
name

chapter
x
as
we
have
seen
livingstone
said
farewell
to
stanley
on
march
and
prepared
to
wait
in
unyanyembe
until
his
friend
had
reached
zanzibar
and
sent
a
body
of
picked
natives
back
to
act
as
his
escort
in
his
diary
he
makes
careful
reckonings
as
to
the
length
of
time
this
will
mean
and
concludes
that
he
can
not
expect
his
men
until
july
it
was
august
before
they
arrived
he
had
to
wait
five
weary
months
at
unyanyembe
and
the
lateness
of
his
start
brought
the
wet
weather
near
and
handicapped
the
expedition
from
the
first
we
may
just
stay
to
record
that
stanley
s
march
to
the
coast
was
beset
with
difficulties
the
whole
ten
plagues
of
egypt
but
it
was
successfully
accomplished
and
the
men
he
sent
back
to
livingstone
were
of
the
very
best
stanley
encountered
at
zanzibar
members
of
an
english
relief
expedition
that
had
been
sent
out
to
find
and
succour
livingstone
of
this
expedition
the
explorer
s
son
oswell
was
a
member
after
hearing
stanley
s
news
they
decided
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
go
on
and
returned
to
england
to
the
ordinary
person
five
months
of
waiting
would
have
been
almost
intolerable
there
are
signs
that
even
livingstone
had
some
ado
to
sit
still
and
count
the
days
but
if
they
were
profitless
months
to
him
and
if
often
he
was
as
he
records
weary
weary
the
revelations
contained
in
his
journal
are
by
no
means
profitless
to
us
he
has
time
to
write
fully
as
to
his
plans
and
his
motives
he
takes
us
into
his
confidence
and
we
see
that
he
has
lost
nothing
in
all
these
years
of
that
eager
curiosity
which
belonged
to
him
as
a
boy
he
still
carries
in
his
breast
the
heart
of
a
little
the
wonderful
ptolemy
and
the
naïve
herodotus
are
pondered
over
and
all
the
stories
of
fountains
and
pillars
awaken
in
the
great
traveller
the
desire
to
test
them
for
himself
he
is
evidently
not
sure
that
there
is
not
something
in
them
after
all
he
would
dearly
like
to
find
out
he
can
not
reconcile
ptolemy
with
the
investigation
of
baker
speke
and
grant
and
it
has
all
the
delight
of
a
fascinating
conundrum
to
him
i
pray
the
good
lord
of
all
to
favour
me
so
as
to
allow
me
to
discover
the
ancient
fountains
of
herodotus
and
if
there
is
anything
in
the
underground
excavations
to
confirm
the
precious
old
documents
τἀ
βιβλία
the
scriptures
of
truth
may
he
permit
me
to
bring
it
to
light
and
give
me
wisdom
to
make
a
proper
use
of
on
the
first
of
may
he
records
that
he
has
finished
a
letter
to
the
york
this
is
the
letter
which
concludes
with
the
now
words
upon
his
tablet
in
the
abbey
all
i
can
add
in
my
loneliness
is
may
heaven
s
rich
blessing
come
down
on
every
one
american
english
or
turk
who
will
help
to
heal
the
open
sore
of
the
by
a
coincidence
the
words
were
written
one
year
to
the
very
day
before
the
writer
s
death
he
meditates
much
on
the
native
faiths
he
recognises
as
the
fundamental
fact
dependence
on
a
divine
power
but
without
any
conscious
feeling
of
its
he
notes
also
their
belief
in
a
continued
existence
after
death
so
as
to
be
able
to
do
good
to
those
they
love
and
evil
to
those
they
hate
i
don
t
know
how
the
great
loving
father
will
bring
all
out
right
at
last
but
he
knows
and
will
do
for
himself
his
confidence
is
anchored
as
it
has
always
been
in
the
plain
word
of
christ
the
perfect
gentleman
he
will
keep
his
word
the
gracious
one
full
of
grace
and
truth
no
doubt
of
it
he
said
him
that
cometh
unto
me
i
will
in
no
wise
cast
out
and
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
in
my
name
that
will
i
he
keep
his
word
then
i
can
come
and
humbly
present
my
petition
and
it
will
be
all
right
doubt
is
here
inadmissible
he
is
reading
speke
s
travels
with
critical
enjoyment
he
spends
a
page
or
two
in
challenging
his
statement
that
african
mothers
sell
their
own
children
he
does
not
believe
it
he
has
never
known
an
instance
nor
have
the
arabs
he
always
defends
the
essential
goodness
of
the
natives
and
their
common
human
feelings
then
he
appeals
to
the
heroism
of
the
church
at
home
to
come
and
help
the
african
people
i
would
say
to
missionaries
come
on
brethren
to
the
real
heathen
you
have
no
idea
how
brave
you
are
till
you
try
leaving
the
coast
tribes
and
devoting
yourselves
heartily
to
the
savages
as
they
are
called
you
will
find
with
some
drawbacks
and
wickednesses
a
very
great
deal
to
admire
and
a
little
later
he
is
arguing
that
the
interior
is
a
tempting
field
for
efforts
of
private
he
thinks
the
missionary
should
make
up
his
mind
not
to
depend
upon
foreign
support
and
gives
instances
of
his
own
resourcefulness
where
he
had
none
to
depend
on
but
himself
he
is
for
a
sort
of
robinson
crusoe
life
the
great
object
being
to
improve
the
improvable
among
the
as
to
method
he
writes
later
no
jugglery
or
would
have
any
effect
in
the
civilisation
of
africans
they
have
too
much
good
sense
for
that
nothing
brings
them
to
place
thorough
confidence
in
europeans
but
a
long
course
of
goodness
and
unselfishness
impress
their
minds
more
than
any
kind
of
skill
or
power
they
say
you
have
different
hearts
from
the
prayer
to
jesus
for
a
new
heart
and
a
right
spirit
at
once
commends
itself
as
he
notes
too
that
music
influences
them
and
often
leads
to
conversion
scattered
through
the
journal
are
his
usual
keen
observations
on
the
animal
life
and
plant
life
of
the
district
together
with
brief
narratives
of
tribal
quarrels
and
crimes
again
and
again
he
confesses
uncertainty
as
to
whether
he
has
not
been
tracing
the
sources
of
the
congo
rather
than
the
nile
if
he
had
not
had
a
scientific
mind
and
training
he
argues
that
long
ere
this
he
would
have
cried
eureka
and
gone
home
with
a
hypothesis
but
his
absolute
love
of
truth
forbids
by
the
middle
of
july
his
men
have
not
come
though
he
has
heard
of
them
as
being
on
the
way
he
is
very
tired
of
the
delay
but
returns
at
length
to
the
subject
of
missions
in
africa
and
indulges
in
one
passage
which
clearly
shows
how
his
puritan
never
deserted
him
a
couple
of
europeans
beginning
and
carrying
on
a
mission
without
a
staff
of
foreign
attendants
implies
coarse
country
fare
it
is
true
but
this
would
be
nothing
to
those
who
at
home
amuse
themselves
with
fasts
vigils
a
great
deal
of
power
is
thus
lost
in
the
church
fastings
and
vigils
without
a
special
object
in
view
are
time
run
to
waste
they
are
made
to
minister
to
a
sort
of
instead
of
being
turned
to
account
for
the
good
of
others
they
are
like
groaning
in
sickness
some
people
amuse
themselves
when
ill
with
continuous
moaning
the
forty
days
of
lent
might
be
annually
spent
in
visiting
adjacent
tribes
and
bearing
unavoidable
hunger
and
thirst
with
a
good
grace
considering
the
greatness
of
the
object
to
be
attained
men
might
go
without
sugar
coffee
tea
i
went
from
september
to
december
without
he
gives
us
also
a
vivid
summary
of
his
impressions
of
the
slave
system
assuring
us
that
in
sober
seriousness
the
subject
does
not
admit
of
exaggeration
to
overdraw
its
evils
is
a
simple
impossibility
the
sights
i
have
seen
though
common
incidents
of
the
traffic
are
so
nauseous
that
i
always
try
to
drive
them
from
memory
in
the
case
of
most
disagreeable
recollections
i
can
succeed
in
time
in
consigning
them
to
oblivion
but
the
slaving
scenes
come
back
unbidden
and
make
me
start
up
at
dead
of
night
horrified
by
their
august
comes
and
still
no
arrivals
there
is
a
charming
description
of
the
african
children
and
their
sports
and
games
followed
by
observations
on
the
swallows
and
the
spiders
then
he
breaks
off
to
exclaim
that
is
the
atonement
of
christ
it
is
himself
it
is
the
inherent
and
everlasting
mercy
of
god
made
apparent
to
human
eyes
and
ears
the
everlasting
love
was
disclosed
by
our
lord
s
life
and
death
it
showed
that
god
forgives
because
he
loves
to
forgive
he
works
by
smiles
if
possible
if
not
by
frowns
pain
is
only
a
means
of
enforcing
at
last
on
august
the
miserable
suspense
is
at
an
end
the
new
expedition
marches
safely
into
unyanyembe
livingstone
lifts
up
his
heart
in
gratitude
to
god
many
of
those
who
have
come
to
help
him
had
marched
with
stanley
and
were
well
seasoned
some
were
nassick
boys
from
bombay
among
whom
were
john
and
jacob
wainwright
it
will
never
be
forgotten
how
much
we
owe
to
the
intelligence
and
courage
of
the
latter
five
only
in
the
new
expedition
belonged
to
livingstone
s
original
these
are
susi
chumah
amoda
mabruki
and
gardner
it
is
much
to
know
that
livingstone
was
never
more
loyally
and
devotedly
served
than
during
this
last
march
which
was
to
have
so
sad
a
termination
and
so
heroic
a
sequel
ten
days
were
allowed
for
rest
and
preparations
for
departure
which
included
the
setting
aside
of
certain
stores
to
await
them
on
the
homeward
march
then
on
august
they
slipped
quietly
out
of
the
town
of
which
livingstone
was
so
weary
and
started
for
the
southern
part
of
tanganyika
we
are
beginning
now
the
last
journey
which
ended
eight
and
a
half
months
later
after
incredible
toils
and
sufferings
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
the
exact
length
of
it
for
there
were
many
short
diversions
one
need
only
remember
that
from
the
middle
of
september
david
livingstone
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
dying
man
the
internal
hæmorrhage
began
again
and
the
entry
in
his
diary
on
september
is
that
for
eight
days
he
has
eaten
nothing
no
rest
and
no
medicines
have
any
lasting
effect
upon
him
after
this
and
he
can
scarcely
have
been
out
of
pain
which
frequently
amounted
to
agony
they
made
their
way
at
first
mainly
through
forest
and
hilly
country
passing
from
village
to
village
each
day
having
its
burden
of
travel
its
problem
of
supplies
livingstone
finds
the
climbing
very
sore
on
legs
and
on
the
of
october
his
eyes
rested
once
again
on
the
blue
waters
of
tanganyika
the
day
heat
is
very
trying
some
of
the
men
are
sick
all
are
tired
inwardly
i
feel
tired
they
had
come
to
tanganyika
by
a
circuitous
route
they
now
kept
to
the
highlands
running
and
travelled
along
the
ridge
feet
above
the
lake
he
notes
that
the
is
favourable
for
cotton
and
admires
the
glory
of
the
sunsets
the
various
arms
and
bays
of
the
lake
are
carefully
observed
the
route
is
still
very
mountainous
and
painfully
up
and
down
october
is
past
before
he
reaches
the
part
where
the
lake
narrows
and
becomes
what
the
natives
call
lake
liemba
it
is
slow
and
weary
work
around
the
southern
section
the
heat
is
intense
the
sun
makes
the
soil
so
hot
that
the
radiation
is
as
if
it
came
from
a
furnace
it
burns
the
feet
of
the
people
and
knocks
them
up
subcutaneous
inflammation
is
frequent
in
the
legs
and
makes
some
of
my
most
hardy
men
he
maintains
that
walking
is
better
than
riding
suddenly
he
breaks
off
his
description
of
the
toilsomeness
of
the
journey
to
set
this
down
the
spirit
of
missions
is
the
spirit
of
our
master
the
very
genesis
of
his
religion
a
diffusive
philanthropy
is
christianity
itself
it
requires
perpetual
propagation
to
attest
its
the
day
after
this
he
is
ill
and
losing
much
another
disaster
is
that
the
large
donkey
which
has
borne
him
from
time
to
time
over
difficult
ground
has
been
badly
bitten
by
tsetse
is
now
useless
and
shortly
dies
it
is
a
great
loss
to
from
the
southern
extremity
of
the
lake
they
proceeded
almost
due
south
the
main
difficulty
being
provided
by
the
lofu
river
over
which
they
built
a
bridge
a
little
further
south
they
turned
westward
evidently
making
for
the
north
of
lake
bangweolo
many
rivers
are
crossed
and
more
hilly
regions
negotiated
then
comes
an
entry
in
the
journal
in
so
shaky
a
hand
as
to
be
almost
undecipherable
it
simply
tells
us
that
he
is
ill
and
camping
in
a
deserted
yet
there
is
no
halting
on
the
march
river
after
river
is
crossed
and
on
december
he
sees
once
more
his
old
friend
the
kalongosi
or
kalongwesé
river
we
crossed
it
in
small
canoes
and
swamped
one
twice
but
no
one
was
they
now
march
south
for
the
lake
christmas
day
our
great
day
is
cold
and
wet
but
it
inspires
livingstone
s
thanks
to
the
good
lord
for
the
good
gift
of
his
son
christ
jesus
our
he
also
finds
time
for
some
meditations
on
the
blue
and
the
white
nile
the
end
of
the
year
brings
very
heavy
weather
during
which
no
observations
can
be
taken
one
of
the
men
also
is
taken
critically
ill
and
dies
they
plant
four
trees
at
the
corners
of
the
grave
as
the
expedition
drew
near
lake
bangweolo
they
came
upon
a
region
composed
of
spongy
morass
the
men
describe
it
as
endless
plunging
in
and
out
of
morasses
and
the
effect
on
their
strength
and
spirits
must
be
conceived
it
was
terrible
work
and
livingstone
was
spent
with
chronic
dysentery
on
they
went
however
plunging
through
this
horrible
country
yet
such
alleviations
as
nature
affords
are
not
forgotten
livingstone
enumerates
all
the
flowers
he
sees
the
marigolds
and
the
jonquils
the
orchids
and
the
clematis
the
gladioli
and
the
flowering
bulbs
he
rejoices
also
to
distinguish
balsams
and
pretty
flowery
aloes
yellow
and
red
in
one
whorl
of
the
world
is
clearly
not
forsaken
that
has
these
tokens
of
the
divine
presence
a
week
of
priceless
time
was
lost
in
the
middle
of
january
owing
to
the
misrepresentations
of
a
chief
called
chungu
and
all
the
while
they
were
marching
aimlessly
over
the
desperate
spongy
country
they
have
to
get
back
to
their
starting
point
and
strike
eastward
to
make
a
circuit
of
the
lake
livingstone
has
to
be
carried
across
many
of
the
morasses
and
rivers
on
the
shoulders
of
one
or
other
of
his
men
the
march
was
at
times
almost
impossible
january
saw
them
quite
lost
no
observations
could
be
taken
and
it
was
rain
rain
then
came
january
and
this
dramatic
entry
in
the
journal
carrying
me
across
one
of
the
broad
deep
sedgy
rivers
is
really
a
very
difficult
task
one
we
crossed
was
at
least
feet
broad
the
first
part
the
main
stream
came
up
to
susi
s
mouth
and
wetted
my
seat
and
legs
one
held
up
my
pistol
behind
then
one
after
another
took
a
turn
and
when
he
sank
into
an
elephant
s
deep
footprints
he
required
two
to
lift
him
every
ten
or
twelve
paces
brought
us
to
a
clear
stream
flowing
fast
in
its
own
channel
while
over
all
a
strong
current
came
bodily
through
all
the
rushes
and
aquatic
plants
susi
had
the
first
spell
then
farijala
then
a
tall
stout
man
then
amoda
then
chanda
then
wadé
salé
and
each
time
i
was
lifted
off
bodily
and
put
on
another
pair
of
stout
willing
shoulders
and
fifty
yards
put
them
out
of
breath
no
wonder
we
are
not
surprised
to
learn
that
progress
is
distressingly
slow
wet
wet
wet
sloppy
weather
truly
and
no
january
closes
miserably
they
have
no
proper
guides
it
is
drop
drop
drop
and
drizzling
from
the
the
country
is
all
froths
and
sponges
livingstone
loses
much
blood
but
with
characteristic
optimism
expresses
the
hope
that
it
is
a
for
he
has
no
fever
the
lack
of
guides
is
serious
livingstone
reckons
they
lost
half
a
month
now
floundering
about
in
this
sodden
depressing
country
suffering
much
hunger
and
it
is
all
due
to
the
unfriendliness
of
some
and
the
fears
of
others
when
guides
were
ultimately
obtained
progress
was
far
more
speedy
and
direct
but
what
the
fatigue
and
exposure
have
meant
to
the
sick
man
can
be
best
gauged
by
the
note
in
the
journal
on
february
which
follows
the
record
of
another
excessive
hæmorrhagic
if
the
good
lord
gives
me
favour
and
permits
me
to
finish
my
work
i
shall
thank
and
bless
him
though
it
costs
me
untold
toil
pain
and
travel
this
trip
has
made
my
hair
all
melancholy
reading
as
the
last
month
has
been
it
is
perhaps
not
so
heartbreaking
as
the
next
it
represents
the
almost
desperate
exertions
of
a
dying
man
to
get
on
yet
he
is
thwarted
and
deceived
at
every
turn
he
fixes
his
hopes
on
the
chief
matipa
and
on
the
of
february
sends
susi
and
chumah
to
find
him
matipa
appeared
to
be
friendly
and
eventually
the
expedition
travels
by
canoes
towards
his
country
then
they
have
to
cross
flooded
prairie
and
camp
on
a
miserable
dirty
fishy
they
arrive
at
last
and
matipa
is
profuse
in
his
promises
and
plausible
in
his
plans
time
was
of
no
value
to
matipa
he
drowned
his
cares
in
pombe
but
livingstone
is
in
misery
day
after
day
passes
and
no
promised
canoes
arrive
to
carry
the
expedition
westward
by
the
of
march
he
is
convinced
that
matipa
is
acting
the
the
next
day
is
his
birthday
and
sacred
to
other
thoughts
thanks
to
the
almighty
preserver
of
man
for
sparing
me
thus
far
on
the
journey
of
life
can
i
hope
for
ultimate
success
so
many
obstacles
have
arisen
let
not
satan
prevail
over
me
o
my
good
lord
jesus
never
had
he
been
in
worse
case
matipa
was
false
again
and
livingstone
took
the
extreme
step
for
him
of
making
a
demonstration
in
force
and
firing
a
pistol
through
the
roof
of
the
chiefs
house
a
movement
which
resulted
in
matipa
s
flight
he
returned
however
soon
after
in
a
chastened
frame
of
mind
some
canoes
being
available
at
last
on
march
livingstone
started
with
all
his
goods
his
object
being
to
get
across
the
chambezé
it
was
an
awful
journey
six
hours
punting
brought
them
to
a
little
islet
without
a
tree
and
the
rain
descended
pitilessly
they
got
what
shelter
they
could
out
of
an
inverted
canoe
and
crouched
under
it
the
wind
tore
the
tent
and
damaged
it
the
loads
were
soaked
it
was
bitterly
cold
a
man
put
my
bed
into
the
bilge
and
never
said
bail
out
so
i
am
safe
for
a
wet
night
but
it
turned
out
better
than
i
nothing
earthly
will
make
me
give
up
my
work
in
despair
i
encourage
myself
in
the
lord
my
god
and
go
the
next
day
sees
them
across
the
chambezé
but
progress
is
extremely
slow
and
it
is
april
the
before
the
neighbouring
river
lobingela
is
passed
meanwhile
as
we
learn
from
a
subsequent
entry
in
the
diary
his
final
critical
illness
has
begun
on
march
an
artery
began
bleeding
yet
he
does
not
dream
of
resting
the
whole
country
round
lake
bangweolo
is
a
shallow
sea
it
is
impossible
to
say
where
the
rivers
begin
and
end
livingstone
s
mode
of
progression
is
being
punted
along
in
a
canoe
further
inland
there
is
a
marching
party
struggling
along
parallel
with
the
canoes
on
april
he
sets
down
that
he
is
pale
and
bloodless
the
artery
gives
off
a
copious
stream
and
takes
away
my
strength
oh
how
i
long
to
be
permitted
by
the
over
power
to
finish
my
the
of
april
witnesses
another
calamity
when
a
tremendous
rain
after
dark
burst
all
our
now
rotten
tents
in
he
is
now
utterly
weak
and
ill
fighting
his
complaint
with
quinine
and
trying
to
believe
it
is
no
more
than
fever
on
the
however
he
confesses
he
is
excessively
weak
and
but
for
the
donkey
could
not
move
a
hundred
he
adds
pawkily
it
is
not
all
pleasure
this
the
diary
is
now
painful
reading
the
writing
becomes
very
shaky
eloquent
of
weakness
and
pain
he
has
service
on
sunday
april
as
usual
the
last
entries
are
quite
short
tried
to
ride
but
was
forced
to
lie
down
and
they
carried
me
back
to
the
fact
is
that
the
old
hero
insisted
on
being
put
on
his
donkey
only
to
fall
to
the
ground
he
was
carried
back
to
the
on
chumah
s
shoulders
carried
on
kitanda
over
buga
the
men
made
a
rude
palanquin
covered
it
with
grass
and
a
blanket
and
in
this
way
carried
the
dying
chief
for
two
hours
and
a
quarter
they
illustration
on
the
last
march
were
two
and
a
quarter
hours
of
excruciating
agony
and
it
was
a
relief
to
all
when
a
village
was
reached
where
a
rude
hut
could
be
erected
the
next
day
was
similar
they
carried
him
for
another
hour
and
a
half
the
following
day
one
hour
s
journey
was
all
that
he
in
his
extreme
emaciation
could
endure
he
was
too
weak
now
to
write
anything
except
the
date
on
the
they
proceeded
for
an
hour
and
found
themselves
among
a
simple
friendly
people
the
trend
of
livingstone
s
thoughts
may
be
gathered
by
some
questions
he
addressed
to
the
natives
he
wanted
to
know
whether
they
had
ever
heard
of
a
hill
on
which
four
rivers
had
their
rise
they
shook
their
heads
but
confessed
themselves
no
travellers
on
the
following
day
they
still
moved
on
and
livingstone
s
unconquerable
hope
appeared
in
the
fact
that
he
instructed
susi
to
buy
two
large
tusks
because
he
might
be
short
of
goods
when
they
got
back
to
ujiji
and
he
could
buy
cloth
of
the
arabs
with
them
the
last
entry
in
the
diary
the
last
words
he
ever
wrote
stand
under
the
date
april
knocked
up
quite
and
remain
recover
sent
to
buy
milch
we
are
on
the
banks
of
the
he
is
lying
at
kolunganjovu
s
town
his
one
hope
is
in
milk
but
the
search
for
milch
goats
was
vain
the
whole
district
had
been
plundered
by
the
mazitu
he
tried
to
eat
a
little
pounded
corn
but
failed
the
was
spent
in
similar
vain
endeavours
to
obtain
milk
on
the
the
chief
who
said
everything
should
be
done
for
his
friend
offered
to
escort
the
caravan
to
the
and
see
them
provided
with
canoes
there
was
an
initial
difficulty
livingstone
could
not
walk
to
the
door
of
the
hut
to
reach
his
litter
the
wall
was
opened
and
the
sick
man
transferred
from
his
bed
to
the
litter
in
that
way
the
narrative
of
his
devoted
men
is
now
most
explicit
it
is
eloquent
alike
of
the
great
leader
s
fortitude
and
their
own
unfailing
consideration
we
need
not
linger
on
the
details
the
agony
of
lifting
him
into
the
canoe
and
lifting
him
out
the
journey
through
swamps
and
plashes
the
arrival
at
chitambo
s
village
the
delays
in
building
the
hut
while
he
lay
under
the
broad
eaves
of
a
native
hut
and
a
soft
drizzle
of
rain
descended
at
last
the
shelter
was
erected
and
banked
round
with
earth
the
bed
was
made
raised
on
sticks
and
grass
the
medicine
chest
placed
on
a
large
box
that
did
duty
for
a
table
and
a
fire
kindled
outside
opposite
the
door
just
inside
the
boy
majwara
lay
down
and
slept
that
he
might
be
at
hand
if
wanted
the
imagination
reverently
dwells
on
every
detail
of
the
scene
for
the
old
hero
has
made
his
last
journey
and
is
about
to
sleep
his
last
sleep
while
he
was
lying
on
his
litter
outside
and
the
rain
was
falling
curious
villagers
had
gathered
round
each
man
with
bow
in
hand
for
they
had
been
guarding
their
crops
this
was
the
great
chief
who
had
come
from
far
his
fame
they
knew
somewhat
they
could
not
know
that
he
was
the
best
friend
africa
ever
had
they
gazed
respectfully
and
wonderingly
at
the
thin
pale
emaciated
sufferer
with
the
bloodless
hands
and
lips
and
the
face
distorted
with
sharp
throes
of
agony
through
the
falling
rain
they
watched
him
and
in
days
to
come
would
tell
their
children
that
they
had
seen
livingstone
that
night
passed
quietly
and
when
chitambo
called
next
day
livingstone
with
unfailing
courtesy
received
him
though
he
had
to
beg
the
chief
to
go
away
and
return
on
the
following
day
when
he
hoped
to
feel
stronger
all
that
morning
he
lay
suffering
his
strength
gradually
ebbing
in
the
afternoon
he
bade
susi
bring
him
his
watch
and
with
great
effort
he
slowly
wound
it
night
fell
at
last
and
at
eleven
o
clock
livingstone
called
susi
there
were
noises
heard
are
our
men
making
those
noises
said
livingstone
susi
told
him
that
the
villagers
were
scaring
a
buffalo
is
this
the
luapula
he
asked
again
and
susi
knew
that
his
master
was
wandering
in
his
mind
how
ardently
he
had
desired
to
reach
the
luapula
through
those
terrible
weeks
and
months
on
the
sponges
and
through
the
floods
when
susi
told
him
where
they
were
he
asked
again
how
many
days
to
the
luapula
i
think
it
is
three
days
said
susi
there
was
no
more
except
the
cry
of
pain
oh
dear
dear
then
he
dozed
near
midnight
he
sent
for
susi
again
this
time
livingstone
told
him
to
boil
some
water
and
when
susi
had
filled
the
copper
kettle
he
again
asked
for
the
medicine
chest
the
candle
had
to
be
held
close
to
him
for
his
eyes
were
very
dim
but
he
did
just
succeed
in
selecting
some
calomel
which
he
wanted
to
have
at
his
side
with
a
little
water
in
a
cup
then
he
said
very
faintly
all
right
you
can
go
these
were
the
last
words
he
was
heard
to
speak
it
almost
seemed
as
if
a
higher
master
had
said
to
his
tired
servant
all
right
can
go
what
happened
after
that
is
known
only
to
the
one
who
was
with
him
at
the
last
the
boy
majwara
slept
and
while
he
slept
the
miracle
happened
for
it
appeared
miraculous
and
incredible
to
his
men
who
had
seen
his
utter
inability
to
move
himself
that
he
did
actually
rise
from
off
that
rude
couch
and
did
kneel
down
at
the
side
his
knees
probably
on
the
bare
soil
and
there
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
commended
himself
to
god
and
his
fair
soul
unto
his
captain
when
the
lad
majwara
awoke
at
and
saw
the
strange
sight
of
his
master
kneeling
thus
he
was
afraid
and
slipped
out
to
warn
the
others
susi
dared
not
go
in
alone
he
ran
to
rouse
chumah
chowperé
matthew
and
nuanyaséré
the
six
stood
awestruck
at
the
door
of
the
little
hut
on
the
box
a
candle
was
burning
it
was
just
stuck
there
in
its
own
wax
but
it
relieved
the
darkness
and
they
gazed
at
the
still
bowed
form
he
was
lying
stretched
forward
across
the
bed
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
none
seemed
to
dare
to
approach
him
for
a
while
then
matthew
reverently
and
tremblingly
stretched
out
his
hand
and
laid
it
on
his
master
s
cheek
it
was
quite
cold
david
livingstone
was
dead
it
was
the
morning
of
the
first
of
may
with
the
death
of
the
hero
most
biographies
perforce
end
in
this
respect
livingstone
s
story
is
wholly
unique
the
most
thrilling
and
sensational
chapter
remains
to
be
written
nothing
more
convincingly
illustrates
livingstone
s
ascendancy
over
his
followers
than
the
events
which
followed
his
death
it
would
have
been
easy
for
the
men
to
have
hurried
the
body
into
the
ground
divided
the
property
among
themselves
and
dispersed
to
their
homes
perhaps
the
last
thing
to
be
expected
was
that
they
would
shoulder
the
dead
body
and
carry
it
from
the
centre
of
africa
more
than
a
thousand
miles
through
hostile
and
inhospitable
country
to
the
ocean
yet
this
was
what
they
did
while
the
method
order
and
reverence
of
their
proceedings
would
have
done
honour
to
the
wisest
and
most
civilised
of
our
race
let
us
now
see
how
they
faced
the
duty
that
had
suddenly
come
to
them
the
discovery
that
livingstone
was
dead
was
made
about
the
news
was
carried
round
at
once
to
all
the
men
and
as
soon
as
day
dawned
they
assembled
for
conference
the
dead
man
s
possessions
were
collected
the
boxes
opened
in
the
presence
of
all
and
jacob
wainwright
made
a
careful
and
exact
inventory
on
a
page
of
livingstone
s
little
metallic
in
which
his
own
last
entries
had
been
made
the
next
business
was
to
appoint
susi
and
chumah
the
oldest
and
most
experienced
of
livingstone
s
followers
as
leaders
of
the
expedition
all
promised
to
obey
their
orders
and
all
kept
their
word
fearing
lest
the
native
superstitions
in
regard
to
departed
spirits
might
lead
to
some
outrage
on
the
dead
body
or
that
chitambo
might
demand
some
ruinous
fine
they
decided
to
conceal
for
the
present
the
fact
of
the
death
in
this
respect
they
had
misjudged
chitambo
who
soon
learned
what
had
happened
and
proved
himself
the
kindest
and
most
sympathetic
of
advisers
all
were
agreed
that
the
body
of
livingstone
must
be
carried
back
to
the
coast
the
first
practical
step
after
making
the
inventory
was
a
remarkable
one
outside
chitambo
s
village
the
men
erected
a
small
settlement
of
their
own
fortified
by
a
stockade
here
they
built
a
circular
hut
open
to
the
sky
but
strong
enough
to
resist
any
attack
of
wild
beasts
and
in
this
they
laid
the
body
of
livingstone
his
followers
were
stationed
all
round
like
a
guard
of
honour
it
happened
that
farijala
had
once
been
servant
to
a
zanzibar
doctor
and
knew
the
elementary
facts
about
a
with
the
assistance
of
a
nassick
boy
carras
he
undertook
to
do
what
was
necessary
certain
rites
of
mourning
having
been
performed
and
volleys
fired
a
screen
was
held
over
these
men
while
they
did
their
work
the
heart
and
viscera
were
removed
placed
in
a
tin
box
and
reverently
buried
four
feet
in
the
ground
while
jacob
wainwright
read
the
burial
service
from
the
english
prayer
book
the
body
was
then
dried
in
sun
for
fourteen
days
so
emaciated
was
it
that
there
was
little
more
than
skin
and
bone
for
coffin
they
stripped
the
bark
off
a
myonga
tree
in
one
piece
the
corpse
was
carefully
enveloped
in
calico
and
inserted
in
the
bark
cylinder
the
whole
was
sewn
up
in
a
piece
of
and
lashed
to
a
pole
so
that
it
could
be
carried
on
the
men
s
shoulders
then
jacob
wainwright
carved
livingstone
s
name
and
the
date
of
his
death
on
the
tree
standing
near
where
the
body
rested
chitambo
was
charged
to
keep
the
ground
free
from
grass
lest
should
burn
the
tree
finally
they
erected
two
strong
posts
with
a
cross
beam
and
covered
them
thoroughly
with
tar
so
that
the
spot
might
be
definitely
identified
they
seem
to
have
forgotten
nothing
that
could
be
done
to
keep
in
perpetual
memory
the
place
where
livingstone
breathed
his
last
the
line
of
march
determined
on
was
up
the
west
coast
of
lake
bangweolo
and
across
the
luapula
river
then
till
they
struck
the
route
by
which
they
had
come
from
unyanyembe
it
seemed
at
the
outset
as
if
all
their
hopes
were
to
be
frustrated
in
three
days
half
the
expedition
were
down
with
fever
two
women
died
susi
became
critically
ill
and
could
not
move
they
were
delayed
a
whole
month
and
only
started
again
to
break
down
once
more
it
was
not
till
they
had
crossed
the
great
luapula
river
four
miles
broad
that
things
went
better
with
them
near
where
the
river
liposhosi
flows
into
the
lake
at
chawendes
village
the
expedition
was
unfortunately
brought
into
active
conflict
with
the
chief
and
his
tribe
and
a
regular
affray
took
place
in
which
blood
was
shed
and
many
native
houses
burned
it
is
probable
that
a
calmer
and
stronger
leadership
might
have
averted
this
but
it
was
proof
of
the
determination
of
the
devoted
band
to
defend
their
precious
burden
with
their
lives
after
this
the
march
was
on
the
whole
a
favourable
and
peaceful
one
they
turned
north
towards
tanganyika
but
profiting
by
previous
experience
gave
the
lake
itself
a
wide
berth
keeping
well
to
the
east
and
traveling
far
more
easily
than
livingstone
had
illustration
carrying
the
body
to
the
sea
done
owing
to
the
fact
that
they
largely
avoided
the
mountainous
region
everywhere
the
news
of
livingstone
s
death
had
preceded
them
and
they
were
made
aware
that
a
party
of
englishmen
was
at
unyanyembe
awaiting
their
arrival
jacob
wainwright
wrote
down
the
story
as
we
know
it
and
chumah
hurried
on
by
forced
marches
to
deliver
it
to
the
englishmen
in
question
who
turned
out
to
be
lieutenant
cameron
dillon
and
lieutenant
murphy
members
of
a
search
expedition
to
them
on
october
chumah
brought
the
news
and
soon
afterwards
the
gallant
band
arrived
and
delivered
all
livingstone
s
belongings
intact
to
his
lieutenant
cameron
was
decidedly
in
favour
of
burying
the
body
in
african
soil
he
also
took
the
liberty
of
appropriating
most
of
livingstone
s
instruments
to
the
use
of
his
expedition
this
latter
act
the
men
were
powerless
to
resist
but
in
regard
to
the
former
they
were
not
to
be
moved
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
them
as
to
the
disturbed
district
between
unyanyembe
and
the
coast
they
had
made
up
their
minds
that
the
great
doctor
must
go
lieutenant
murphy
and
dillon
decided
to
return
to
zanzibar
with
them
and
the
former
does
not
appear
to
have
been
a
very
amicable
companion
dillon
s
tragic
fate
is
well
known
seized
with
fever
on
the
journey
he
went
out
of
his
mind
and
committed
suicide
one
further
incident
has
to
be
recorded
illustrative
of
the
resolution
and
ingenuity
of
the
members
of
the
expedition
near
kasekera
matters
developed
threateningly
and
the
men
became
convinced
that
there
would
be
growing
hostility
along
the
route
to
the
passage
of
a
dead
body
they
accordingly
resorted
to
a
ruse
they
unpacked
the
body
and
repacked
it
to
look
like
an
ordinary
bale
of
goods
then
they
filled
the
old
cylinder
with
sticks
and
grasses
and
solemnly
despatched
six
men
back
to
unyanyembe
to
bury
it
needless
to
say
that
as
soon
as
these
men
got
well
into
the
jungle
they
disposed
of
their
burden
and
rejoined
the
main
caravan
by
devious
routes
so
well
did
every
man
keep
his
counsel
that
it
was
believed
henceforth
that
ordinary
merchandise
was
being
carried
to
zanzibar
on
february
their
sacred
charge
was
fulfilled
and
their
precious
burden
so
jealously
and
triumphantly
preserved
was
handed
over
to
the
possession
of
the
british
consul
at
bagamoio
on
the
coast
the
transferred
the
remains
to
aden
and
the
and
steamer
carried
them
thence
to
southampton
where
on
april
a
special
train
was
in
waiting
to
convey
them
to
london
that
evening
they
were
deposited
in
the
rooms
of
the
geographical
society
in
savile
row
and
examined
by
sir
william
fergusson
and
other
medical
gentlemen
the
oblique
fracture
of
the
arm
which
had
been
broken
by
the
lion
so
many
years
before
and
the
false
joint
that
had
resulted
provided
ample
identification
of
the
remains
on
saturday
april
they
were
borne
through
the
crowded
streets
of
the
capital
to
westminster
abbey
and
deposited
in
the
centre
of
the
nave

my
chapter
xi
characteristics
the
life
of
livingstone
has
been
indifferently
told
if
the
personality
of
the
man
has
not
appeared
in
these
pages
but
the
reader
will
welcome
a
few
personal
details
that
could
not
well
find
a
place
in
previous
chapters
the
portrait
of
livingstone
is
well
known
it
is
a
strong
rugged
face
rather
heavy
and
severe
in
its
general
effect
with
a
thick
dark
moustache
a
broad
mouth
and
full
chin
the
whole
lightened
however
by
the
honest
kindly
eyes
and
the
suggestion
of
humour
about
the
lips
when
he
was
a
young
man
it
would
appear
that
his
hair
was
almost
black
but
it
became
lighter
in
colour
later
and
the
lock
of
it
in
possession
of
one
of
his
relatives
is
distinctly
brown
he
is
himself
our
authority
for
saying
that
his
beard
was
reddish
in
colour
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
this
respect
all
our
pictures
are
at
fault
not
one
of
them
shows
us
a
bearded
african
traveller
yet
except
on
his
visits
to
england
he
always
wore
a
beard
stanley
s
first
impression
was
of
the
man
whom
he
found
at
ujiji
later
on
he
noted
that
his
hair
had
still
a
brownish
colour
but
that
his
beard
and
moustache
were
very
stanley
also
paid
a
tribute
to
the
brightness
of
his
eyes
which
he
says
were
hazel
they
appear
to
have
been
grey
with
a
bluish
tinge
livingstone
himself
comments
on
the
astonishment
of
the
natives
at
his
red
beard
and
blue
eyes
from
that
reference
one
might
imagine
that
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
viking
or
scandinavian
but
the
fact
is
that
his
eyes
were
really
more
grey
than
blue
and
that
his
hair
was
a
very
dark
brown
while
his
beard
was
more
distinctively
scotch
and
in
height
he
always
appeared
quite
short
when
in
contact
with
tall
companions
but
he
was
about
average
height
say
five
feet
six
inches
certainly
not
more
he
had
the
broad
chest
and
shoulders
of
a
man
specially
built
to
endure
exceptional
fatigue
but
otherwise
he
always
created
the
impression
of
a
short
and
spare
man
that
he
inherited
an
iron
constitution
is
evident
from
the
mere
narrative
of
his
travels
and
privations
one
of
the
things
that
most
vividly
impressed
stanley
was
how
swiftly
the
man
he
found
so
worn
and
thin
and
haggard
threw
off
the
burden
of
the
years
recovered
his
old
buoyancy
of
spirit
and
physical
efficiency
and
took
upon
him
the
appearance
of
one
who
was
ten
years
younger
than
his
actual
age
he
was
in
some
ways
a
fastidious
person
he
was
scrupulously
neat
in
his
manner
of
dress
even
on
his
travels
when
making
his
way
through
swamp
and
jungle
the
one
luxury
he
most
prized
was
a
change
of
raiment
and
his
torn
clothes
would
be
mended
to
the
best
of
his
ability
stanley
found
him
dressed
in
a
red
shirt
with
a
crimson
joho
with
a
gold
band
round
his
cap
an
old
tweed
pair
of
pants
and
shoes
looking
the
worse
for
the
wonder
is
he
had
anything
left
that
was
fit
to
be
seen
and
the
new
apparel
that
came
to
him
was
hailed
with
genuine
exclamations
of
delight
he
set
great
store
on
an
example
to
the
natives
of
simplicity
and
neatness
this
characteristic
also
comes
out
in
other
ways
his
diaries
are
done
with
wonderful
care
and
precision
his
handwriting
was
not
naturally
good
but
it
is
admirably
legible
every
entry
in
his
diary
bears
upon
it
the
marks
of
method
and
neatness
while
the
scientific
observations
are
set
forth
with
a
clearness
which
won
the
highest
praise
from
those
best
competent
to
give
it
nothing
was
slurred
over
there
is
no
sign
of
hurry
or
of
the
exhaustion
of
patience
similarly
there
is
a
notable
absence
of
all
embroidery
the
language
is
throughout
austerely
plain
and
truthful
everything
is
in
keeping
with
his
essential
character
of
a
man
who
hated
the
vulgarity
of
useless
or
tawdry
rhetoric
and
held
always
by
the
refinement
of
simplicity
from
many
anecdotes
related
of
him
it
is
clear
that
not
only
his
writing
but
his
private
and
public
speech
were
affected
by
his
taste
in
this
respect
a
letter
is
extant
in
which
he
counselled
his
children
to
speak
english
because
it
was
prettier
than
scotch
he
was
doubtless
thinking
of
the
somewhat
coarse
scotch
accent
prevalent
in
glasgow
and
the
neighbourhood
where
his
youth
was
spent
strangers
who
met
him
were
uniformly
impressed
by
the
softness
and
gentleness
of
his
speech
his
voice
was
deep
and
if
sometimes
in
public
it
took
on
a
harsh
sound
this
was
undoubtedly
due
to
the
difficulty
of
public
utterance
which
he
never
mastered
his
addresses
to
great
audiences
in
england
were
always
delivered
in
a
slow
hesitating
and
rather
laboured
fashion
for
one
thing
he
grew
so
accustomed
to
thinking
and
speaking
in
the
native
languages
of
africa
that
his
own
tongue
became
strange
to
him
but
apart
from
that
he
was
never
a
fluent
speaker
public
address
was
an
ordeal
to
him
and
he
had
a
puritan
disposition
towards
restraint
and
reserve
combined
with
a
scientific
predilection
for
exact
statement
the
impression
he
left
upon
his
audience
however
was
always
powerful
every
one
who
heard
him
testifies
that
the
man
triumphed
where
the
orator
was
most
to
seek
when
he
once
became
sufficiently
at
home
with
any
one
to
conquer
his
natural
reserve
he
was
excellent
company
for
he
had
a
large
fund
of
humour
and
the
gift
of
teufelsdröckian
laughter
a
laugh
of
the
whole
man
from
heel
to
he
was
especially
devoted
to
children
one
of
my
correspondents
remembers
him
most
vividly
with
a
child
on
each
knee
telling
them
lion
stories
and
another
recalls
his
own
boyhood
and
days
of
sickness
in
bed
brightened
by
a
visit
from
livingstone
who
showed
him
the
marks
of
the
lion
s
teeth
in
his
arm
and
entertained
him
with
some
of
his
adventures
the
atmosphere
that
he
most
detested
was
the
atmosphere
of
flattery
there
is
a
fine
story
about
him
which
illustrates
this
he
had
been
invited
out
to
dinner
and
had
fallen
to
the
lot
of
a
society
lady
who
was
injudicious
enough
to
indulge
in
some
very
highly
coloured
compliments
on
his
achievements
suddenly
livingstone
left
the
table
and
was
afterwards
discovered
sitting
in
a
room
in
the
dark
he
explained
that
he
could
not
endure
to
be
praised
to
his
face
and
that
he
would
not
sit
and
listen
to
it
one
who
knew
him
intimately
told
me
of
a
lecture
delivered
in
one
of
our
great
northern
towns
two
local
orators
introduced
the
proceedings
with
speeches
magnifying
livingstone
s
achievements
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
he
had
an
overwhelming
reception
but
turning
straight
to
a
large
map
he
said
in
a
singularly
cold
hard
voice
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
about
the
river
system
of
central
africa
be
good
enough
to
look
at
this
map
and
plunged
into
his
subject
without
a
word
of
reference
to
anything
that
had
been
said
about
himself
he
was
the
least
vain
and
most
unspoiled
of
any
man
who
was
ever
lionised
by
the
british
public
the
secret
of
which
was
undoubtedly
to
be
found
in
the
humility
and
sincerity
of
his
christian
faith
and
character
of
that
faith
something
ought
to
be
said
in
his
earliest
letters
which
have
been
preserved
we
can
see
how
strongly
he
was
influenced
by
forms
of
theology
that
have
long
since
ceased
to
be
regarded
as
scriptural
that
the
heathen
who
had
never
heard
of
christ
were
perishing
eternally
was
a
doctrine
that
inspired
much
missionary
devotion
these
dogmas
it
is
clear
very
gradually
became
impossible
to
him
in
view
of
the
actual
facts
of
the
vast
heathen
world
but
the
supreme
motive
never
changed
in
a
letter
written
just
at
the
time
of
his
ordination
he
expresses
his
sense
of
the
honour
done
to
him
in
being
accepted
by
christ
jesus
as
one
of
his
witnesses
the
absolute
surrender
of
his
own
will
and
mind
to
his
fair
captain
christ
was
the
fact
most
fundamental
to
livingstone
s
whole
career
to
the
last
he
never
felt
that
he
was
really
in
the
way
of
duty
unless
he
was
doing
missionary
work
and
bearing
witness
to
the
lordship
of
christ
stanley
bore
his
testimony
to
the
practical
character
of
livingstone
s
religion
in
him
religion
exhibits
its
loveliest
features
it
governs
his
conduct
not
only
towards
his
servants
but
towards
the
natives
the
bigoted
mohammedans
and
all
who
come
in
contact
with
in
another
striking
phrase
he
says
religion
has
tamed
him
and
made
him
a
christian
until
his
physical
powers
utterly
failed
he
never
omitted
to
gather
his
men
around
him
for
evening
service
read
and
pray
with
them
and
add
some
simple
exhortation
he
was
a
man
of
deep
convictions
once
thoroughly
alive
to
some
fact
he
took
a
tenacious
grip
of
it
and
gave
it
a
place
in
all
his
thinking
that
was
how
it
came
to
pass
that
neither
the
politicians
nor
the
men
of
science
could
prevail
upon
him
to
leave
the
social
sore
of
africa
to
others
and
devote
himself
to
exploration
and
discovery
livingstone
s
puritan
soul
that
knew
how
to
put
first
things
in
the
first
place
realised
that
the
fact
of
most
moment
in
africa
was
not
the
sources
of
the
nile
but
the
sources
of
the
slave
trade
this
great
social
problem
had
to
be
attacked
if
religious
and
spiritual
work
was
not
to
be
negatived
much
might
be
written
about
his
courage
in
alienating
those
who
sympathised
with
his
work
as
an
explorer
and
those
who
might
have
assisted
him
financially
he
knew
quite
well
that
a
price
must
be
paid
by
any
one
who
was
really
in
earnest
to
destroy
the
slave
trade
but
nothing
moved
him
henceforth
it
was
a
case
of
this
one
thing
i
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
fact
of
all
is
how
early
in
his
life
he
perceived
that
here
lay
the
path
he
was
to
tread
there
lies
before
me
as
i
write
an
old
brown
and
much
torn
letter
which
must
have
been
the
first
he
wrote
from
the
cape
on
his
arrival
there
and
is
dated
march
every
inch
of
the
large
sheet
is
covered
with
writing
and
among
the
last
words
is
a
reference
to
the
resistance
of
certain
of
the
boers
to
the
policy
of
emancipation
then
follows
this
sentence
oh
when
shall
the
time
come
in
which
every
man
that
feels
the
heat
of
the
sun
shall
be
freed
from
all
other
fetters
but
bonds
of
love
to
our
saviour
so
the
young
missionary
wrote
in
his
first
letter
from
africa
so
he
prayed
and
strove
for
thirty
laborious
and
weary
years
and
so
he
prays
still
from
his
grave
in
the
abbey
and
few
will
claim
that
that
prayer
has
been
vainly
uttered
in
the
ear
of
god
and
man
his
unique
influence
over
the
natives
of
africa
is
admitted
it
may
not
be
possible
wholly
to
analyse
his
secret
for
such
words
as
personality
and
magnetism
are
easily
written
and
do
not
help
us
very
much
two
things
we
may
say
on
this
subject
and
leave
it
firstly
he
believed
in
them
and
secondly
he
did
not
expect
too
much
of
them
this
is
no
more
than
to
say
that
he
entered
into
his
inheritance
by
means
of
the
two
ancient
and
scriptural
keys
faith
and
patience
he
was
abundantly
rewarded
for
his
faith
any
one
he
said
once
who
lives
long
among
them
the
natives
forgets
that
they
are
black
and
remembers
only
that
they
are
that
was
certainly
all
that
he
remembered
the
stories
of
sechele
sebituane
sekeletu
and
others
would
have
set
the
crown
on
his
reputation
were
it
not
that
that
was
reserved
for
the
heroic
band
who
attended
him
on
the
last
of
his
journeys
and
made
themselves
an
everlasting
name
by
their
final
and
supreme
act
of
devotion
but
if
he
saw
their
splendid
possibilities
underneath
all
their
degradation
he
never
expected
too
much
of
them
his
scientific
mind
appreciated
all
that
they
owed
to
centuries
of
savagery
and
superstition
he
was
infinitely
patient
with
them
he
forgave
them
until
seventy
times
seven
he
quietly
and
gently
reasoned
with
them
when
any
other
white
man
would
have
lost
his
temper
and
resorted
to
force
he
could
hardly
be
persuaded
even
to
punish
the
recreant
with
any
severity
i
have
faults
myself
he
would
say
simply
the
last
word
should
concern
his
and
disinterestedness
neither
as
missionary
nor
as
government
official
is
there
any
trail
of
commercialism
over
his
life
when
the
bank
in
bombay
failed
with
the
money
he
had
lodged
in
its
keeping
it
hardly
cost
him
a
pang
all
his
money
was
dedicated
to
the
cause
in
which
he
gave
his
life
and
his
personal
serenity
was
quite
independent
of
possessions
he
refused
to
bargain
with
the
government
as
to
terms
and
when
lord
palmerston
sent
a
friend
to
ask
what
he
could
do
for
him
livingstone
s
whole
ambitions
were
centred
on
an
international
arrangement
that
would
sanction
the
creation
of
settlements
which
could
stand
between
the
natives
and
the
slavers
at
no
single
period
in
his
life
is
there
any
tittle
of
evidence
that
he
cared
for
money
save
as
it
might
advance
the
cause
that
was
dearer
to
him
than
life
itself
the
world
still
argues
and
disputes
as
to
what
it
is
that
constitutes
the
highest
form
of
greatness
in
the
common
acceptation
of
the
term
livingstone
was
not
a
man
of
genius
he
was
not
brilliant
he
was
not
strikingly
original
what
he
achieved
was
done
by
the
genius
falsely
so
called
of
taking
pains
but
this
we
may
surely
say
if
human
greatness
consists
not
in
any
natural
endowment
alone
whether
of
the
genius
of
those
who
seem
not
to
compete
nor
strive
yet
with
the
foremost
aye
arrive
or
the
genius
of
industry
in
those
who
believe
that
it
is
dogged
as
does
it
but
rather
in
all
the
powers
and
faculties
of
a
man
s
nature
brought
into
subjection
to
one
supreme
disinterested
ambition
for
the
glory
of
god
and
the
good
of
man
then
few
greater
men
have
ever
walked

the

was
thrilled
over
thirty
years
ago
by
the
story
of
clough
s
work
now
for
the
first
time
we
have
opportunity
to
study
his
methods
to
get
at
the
social

and
religious
principles
which
lay
behind
faunce
president

university
dr
clough
was
one
of
the
founders
of
the
modern
era
in
missions
before
him
the
purpose
largely
had
been
to
produce
a
western
type
of
christianity
in
oriental
lands
clough
caught
a
vision
of
the
transforming
of
peoples
upon
the
foundation
of
the
crude
village
organization
which
he
found
he
built
a
christianity
of
oriental
type
his
method
of
baptizing
converts
from
heathenism
thousands
at
a
time
on
credible
profession
of
faith
in
christ
has
profoundly
affected
the

preaching

is
a
social
virtue
nothing
can
be
more
fundamental
to
the
preacher
than
his

the
deepest
needs

desires
of

age
must

in
his
life
