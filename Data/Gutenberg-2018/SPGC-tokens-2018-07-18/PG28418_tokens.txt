buccaneer
chapter
i
on
the
morning
of
the
of
july
anyone
who
had
been
standing
on
the
low
rocks
of
the
penobscot
bay
shore
might
have
seen
a
large
clumsy
boat
of
hewn
planking
making
its
way
out
against
the
tide
that
set
strongly
up
into
the
river
mouth
she
was
loaded
deep
with
a
shifting
noisy
cargo
that
lifted
white
noses
and
huddled
broad
woolly
backs
in
fact
nothing
less
extraordinary
than
fifteen
fat
southdown
sheep
and
a
the
crew
of
this
remarkable
craft
consisted
of
a
sinewy
bearded
man
of
who
minded
sheet
and
tiller
in
the
stern
and
a
boy
of
fourteen
tall
and
broad
for
his
age
who
was
constantly
employed
in
soothing
and
restraining
the
bleating
flock
no
one
was
present
to
witness
the
spectacle
because
in
those
remote
days
there
were
scarcely
a
thousand
white
men
on
the
whole
coast
of
maine
from
kittery
to
louisberg
while
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
indians
were
following
the
migrating
game
along
the
northern
rivers
the
nearest
settlement
was
a
tiny
log
hamlet
ten
miles
up
the
bay
which
the
two
voyagers
had
left
that
morning
the
boy
keen
face
under
its
shock
of
sandy
hair
was
turned
toward
the
sea
and
the
dim
outline
of
land
that
smudged
the
southern
horizon
father

suddenly
asked
how
big
is
the
island

there

illustration
jeremy
huh
snorted
jeremy
to
himself
indeed
it
was
not
very
likely
that
this
lad
raised
on
the
wildest
of
frontiers
would
mind
the
prospect
of
a
night
alone
on
an
island
ten
miles
out
at
sea
he
had
seen
indian
raids
before
he
was
old
enough
to
know
what
frightened
him
had
tried
his
best
with
his
fists
to
save
his
mother
in
the
amesbury
massacre
six
years
before
and
in
a
little
settlement
on
the
saco
river
when
he
was
twelve
he
had
done
a
work
at
the
blockhouse
loophole
loading
nearly
as
fast
and
firing
as
true
as
any
woodsman
in
the
company
danger
and
strife
had
given
the
lad
an
alert
far
beyond
his
years
amos
swan
his
father
was
one
of
those
iron
spirits
that
fought
out
the
struggle
with
the
new
england
wilderness
in
the
early
days
he
had
followed
the
advancing
line
of
colonization
into
the
northeast
hewing
his
way
with
the
other
pioneers
what
he
sought
was
a
place
to
raise
sheep
instead
of
increasing
however
his
flock
had
dwindled
wolves
here
lynxes
there
dogs
in
the
larger
settlements
after
the
last
onslaught
he
had
determined
to
move
with
his
possessions
and
his
two
boys
tom
nineteen
years
old
and
the
smaller
jeremy
to
an
island
too
remote
for
the
attacks
of
any
wild
animal
so
he
had
set
out
in
a
canoe
chosen
his
place
of
habitation
and
built
a
temporary
shelter
on
it
for
family
and
flock
while
at
home
the
boys
with
the
help
of
a
few
settlers
had
laid
the
keel
and
fashioned
the
hull
of
a
rude
but
seaworthy
boat
such
as
the
coast
fishermen
used
preparations
had
been
completed
the
evening
before
and
now
while
tom
cared
for
half
the
flock
on
the
mainland
the
father
and
younger
son
were
convoying
the
first
load
to
their
new
home
in
the
day
when
these
events
took
place
the
hundreds
of
rocky
bits
of
land
that
line
the
maine
coast
stood
out
against
the
gray
sea
as
bleak
and
desolate
as
at
the
world
beginning
some
were
merely
huge
rocks
that
rose
sheer
out
of
the
atlantic
a
hundred
feet
high
and
on
whose
tops
the
nested
by
the
million
the
larger
ones
however
had
through
countless
ages
accumulated
a
layer
of
earth
that
covered
their
gaunt
sides
except
where
an
occasional
naked
rib
of
gray
granite
was
thrust
out
sparse
grass
struggled
with
the
junipers
for
a
foothold
along
the
slopes
and
low
black
firs
whose
seed
had
been
or
from
the
mainland
climbed
the
rugged
crest
of
each
island
few
men
visited
them
and
almost
none
inhabited
them
since
the
first
long
norse
galley
swung
by
to
the
tune
of
the
singing
rowers
the
number
of
passing
ships
had
increased
and
their
character
had
changed
but
the
isles
were
rarely
touched
at
except
by
mishap
a
shipwreck
or
a
crew
in
need
of
water
the
indians
too
left
the
outer
ones
alone
for
there
was
no
game
to
be
killed
there
and
the
fishing
was
no
better
than
in
the
sheltered
inlets
it
was
to
one
of
the
larger
of
these
islands
twenty
miles
south
of
the
penobscot
settlement
and
a
little
to
the
southwest
of
mount
desert
that
a
wind
brought
the
cumbersome
craft
near
in
a
long
bay
that
cut
deep
into
the
landward
shore
amos
swan
had
found
a
pebbly
beach
a
score
of
yards
in
length
where
a
boat
could
be
run
in
at
any
tide
as
it
was
just
past
the
flood
the
man
and
boy
had
little
difficulty
in
beaching
their
vessel
far
up
toward
high
next
one
by
one
the
frightened
sheep
were
hoisted
over
the
gunwale
into
the
shallow
water
the
old
ram
chosen
for
the
first
to
disembark
quickly
waded
out
upon
dry
land
and
the
others
followed
as
fast
as
they
were
freed
while
the
collie
barked
at
their
heels
the
lightened
boat
was
run
higher
up
the
beach
and
the
man
and
boy
carried
load
after
load
of
tools
equipment
and
provisions
up
the
slope
to
the
small
log
shack
some
two
hundred
yards
away
jeremy
father
helped
him
drive
the
sheep
into
a
rude
fenced
pen
beside
the
hut
then
hurried
back
to
launch
his
boat
and
make
the
return
trip
as
he
started
to
climb
in
he
patted
the
boy
shoulder
lad
said
he
gently
take
care
of
the
sheep
eat
your
supper
and
go
to
bed
i
be
back
before
this
time
tomorrow
aye
father
answered
jeremy
he
tried
to
look
cheerful
and
unconcerned
but
as
the
sail
filled
and
the
boat
drew
out
of
the
cove
he
had
to
swallow
hard
to
keep
up
appearances
for
some
reason
he
could
not
explain
he
felt
homesick
only
old
jock
the
collie
who
shouldered
up
to
him
and
gave
his
hand
a
companionable
lick
kept
the
boy
from
shedding
a
few
unmanly
tears
chapter
ii
the
shelter
that
amos
swan
had
built
stood
on
a
small
bare
knoll
at
an
elevation
of
fifty
or
sixty
feet
above
the
sea
behind
it
and
sheltering
it
from
easterly
and
southerly
winds
rose
the
island
in
sharp
and
rugged
ridges
to
a
high
hilltop
perhaps
a
mile
away
between
lay
ascending
stretches
of
dark
fir
woods
rough
outcroppings
of
stone
and
patches
of
hardy
grass
and
bushes
the
crown
of
the
hill
was
a
bare
granite
ledge
as
round
and
nearly
as
smooth
as
an
inverted
bowl
jeremy
scrambling
through
the
last
bit
of
clinging
undergrowth
in
the
late
afternoon
came
up
against
the
steep
side
of
this
rocky
summit
and
paused
for
breath
he
had
left
jock
with
the
sheep
which
comfortably
chewed
the
cud
in
their
pen
and
slipping
a
sort
pistol
heavy
and
into
his
belt
had
started
to
explore
a
bit
he
must
have
worked
halfway
round
the
granite
hillock
before
he
found
a
place
that
offered
foothold
for
a
climb
a
crevice
in
the
side
of
the
rock
in
which
small
stones
had
become
wedged
gave
him
the
chance
he
wanted
and
it
took
him
only
a
minute
to
reach
the
rounded
surface
near
the
top
the
ledge
on
which
he
found
himself
was
reasonably
flat
nearly
circular
and
perhaps
twenty
yards
across
illustration
its
height
above
the
sea
must
have
been
several
hundred
feet
for
in
the
clear
light
jeremy
could
see
not
only
the
whole
outline
of
the
island
but
most
of
the
bay
as
well
and
far
to
the
west
the
blue
masses
of
the
camden
mountains
he
was
surprised
at
the
size
of
the
new
domain
spread
out
at
his
feet
the
island
seemed
to
be
about
seven
miles
in
length
by
five
at
its
widest
part
two
deep
bays
cut
into
its
otherwise
rounded
outline
it
was
near
the
shore
of
the
northern
one
that
the
hut
and
were
built
southwesterly
from
the
hill
and
farther
away
jeremy
could
see
the
head
of
the
second
and
larger
inlet
between
the
bays
the
distance
could
hardly
have
been
more
than
two
miles
but
a
high
ridge
the
backbone
of
the
island
which
ran
westward
from
the
hilltop
divided
them
by
its
rugged
barrier
jeremy
looked
away
up
the
bay
where
he
could
still
see
the
speck
of
white
sail
that
showed
his
father
hurrying
landward
on
a
long
tack
with
the
west
wind
abeam
the
boy
loneliness
was
gone
he
felt
himself
the
lord
of
a
great
maritime
province
which
from
his
high
watchtower
he
seemed
to
hold
in
undisputed
sovereignty
beneath
him
and
off
to
the
southward
lay
a
little
island
or
two
and
then
the
cold
blue
of
the
atlantic
stretching
away
and
away
to
the
world
rim
even
as
he
glowed
with
this
feeling
of
dominion
he
suddenly
became
aware
of
a
gray
spot
to
the
southwest
a
tiny
spot
that
nevertheless
interrupted
his
musing
it
was
a
ship
apparently
of
good
size
bound
up
the
coast
and
bowling
smartly
nearer
before
the
breeze
the
boy
dream
of
empire
was
shattered
he
was
no
longer
alone
in
his
universe
the
sun
was
setting
and
he
turned
with
a
yawn
to
descend
ships
were
interesting
but
just
now
he
was
hungry
at
the
edge
of
the
crevice
he
looked
back
once
more
and
was
surprised
to
see
a
second
sail
behind
the
first
a
smaller
vessel
it
seemed
but
shortening
the
distance
between
them
rapidly
he
was
surprised
and
somewhat
disgusted
that
so
much
traffic
should
pass
the
doors
of
this
kingdom
which
he
had
thought
to
be
at
the
world
end
so
he
clambered
down
the
cliff
and
made
his
way
homeward
this
time
following
the
summit
of
the
ridge
till
he
came
opposite
the
northern
inlet
chapter
iii
it
was
growing
dark
already
in
the
dense
fir
growth
that
covered
the
hillside
and
when
jeremy
suddenly
stepped
upon
the
moss
at
the
brink
of
a
deep
spring
he
had
to
catch
a
branch
to
keep
from
falling
in
there
was
an
opening
in
the
trees
above
and
enough
light
came
through
for
him
to
see
the
white
sand
bubbling
at
the
bottom
at
one
edge
the
water
lapped
softly
over
the
moss
and
trickled
down
the
northern
slope
of
the
hill
in
a
little
rivulet
which
had
in
the
course
of
time
shaped
itself
a
deep
bed
a
yard
or
two
across
following
this
the
boy
soon
came
out
upon
the
grassy
slope
beside
the
he
looked
in
at
the
placid
flock
brought
a
bucket
of
water
from
the
little
stream
and
not
caring
to
light
a
lantern
ate
his
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
outside
the
hut
on
the
slope
facing
the
bay
the
night
settled
chill
but
without
fog
the
boy
wrapped
his
heavy
homespun
cloak
round
him
snuggled
close
to
jock
hairy
side
and
in
his
lonesomeness
fell
back
on
counting
the
stars
as
they
came
out
first
the
great
yellow
planet
in
the
west
then
high
overhead
the
sparkling
white
of
what
had
he
known
it
was
vega
and
in
a
moment
a
dozen
others
were
in
view
before
he
could
number
them
regulus
altair
spica
and
low
in
the
south
the
angry
fire
of
antares
for
him
they
were
unnamed
save
for
the
peculiarities
he
discovered
in
each
in
common
with
most
boys
he
could
trace
the
dipper
and
find
the
north
star
but
he
regrouped
most
of
the
constellations
to
suit
himself
and
was
able
to
see
the
outline
of
a
wolf
or
the
head
of
an
indian
that
covered
half
the
sky
whenever
he
chose
he
wondered
what
had
become
of
orion
whose
brilliant
galaxy
of
stars
appeals
to
every
boy
fancy
it
had
vanished
since
the
spring
in
it
he
had
always
recognized
the
form
of
a
brig
he
had
seen
in
portsmouth
harbor
high
poop
bowsprit
and
ominous
even
row
of
where
she
carried
her
carronades
three
on
a
side
how
those
black
had
gaped
at
the
small
boy
on
the
dock
he
wondered
boom
came
a
hollow
sound
that
seemed
to
hang
like
mist
in
a
long
echo
over
the
island
before
jeremy
could
jump
to
his
feet
he
heard
the
rumbling
report
a
second
time
he
was
all
alert
now
and
thought
rapidly
those
sounds
there
came
another
even
as
he
stood
there
must
be
nothing
less
the
ships
he
had
seen
from
the
hilltop
were
then
could
the
french
have
sent
a
fleet
he
did
not
know
of
any
recent
fighting
what
could
it
mean
deep
night
had
settled
over
the
island
and
the
looked
very
black
and
uninviting
to
jeremy
when
he
started
up
the
hill
once
more
as
their
shadow
engulfed
him
he
was
tempted
to
turn
back
how
he
was
to
wish
he
had
done
so
in
the
days
that
followed
but
the
hardy
strain
of
adventure
in
his
spirit
kept
his
jaw
set
and
his
legs
working
steadily
forward
into
the
undergrowth
once
or
twice
he
stumbled
over
fallen
logs
or
tripped
in
the
rocks
but
he
held
on
upward
till
the
trees
thinned
and
he
felt
that
the
looming
shape
of
the
ledge
was
just
in
front
his
heart
seemed
to
beat
almost
as
loudly
as
the
cannonade
while
he
felt
his
way
up
the
broken
stones
panting
with
excitement
he
struggled
to
the
top
and
threw
himself
forward
to
the
southern
edge
a
quiet
sea
met
the
dim
line
of
the
sky
in
the
south
halfway
between
land
and
horizon
perhaps
a
league
distant
jeremy
saw
two
vague
splotches
of
darkness
then
a
sudden
flame
shot
out
from
the
smaller
one
on
the
right
seconds
elapsed
before
his
waiting
ear
heard
the
booming
roar
of
the
report
he
looked
for
the
bigger
ship
to
answer
in
kind
but
the
next
flash
came
from
the
right
as
before
this
time
he
saw
a
bright
sheet
of
fire
go
up
from
the
vessel
on
the
left
illuminating
her
spars
and
topsails
the
sound
of
the
cannon
was
drowned
in
an
instant
by
a
terrific
explosion
jeremy
trembled
on
his
rock
the
ships
were
in
darkness
for
a
moment
after
that
first
great
flare
and
then
before
another
shot
could
be
fired
little
tongues
of
flame
began
to
spread
along
the
hull
and
rigging
of
the
larger
craft
little
by
little
the
fire
gained
headway
till
the
whole
upper
works
were
a
single
great
torch
by
its
light
the
victorious
vessel
was
plainly
visible
she
was
a
of
eighty
or
ninety
tons
burden
and
with
a
great
sweep
of
mainsail
below
her
deck
the
muzzles
of
brass
guns
gleamed
in
the
black
ports
as
the
blazing
ship
drifted
helplessly
off
to
the
east
the
sloop
came
about
and
to
jeremy
amazement
made
straight
for
the
southern
bay
of
the
island
he
lay
as
if
glued
to
his
rock
watching
the
stranger
hold
her
course
up
the
inlet
and
come
head
to
wind
within
a
dozen
of
the
shore
chapter
iv
one
of
the
first
things
a
backwoods
boy
learns
is
that
it
pays
to
mind
your
own
business
you
know
what
the
other
fellow
is
going
to
do
jeremy
had
been
threshing
his
brain
for
a
solution
to
the
scene
he
had
just
witnessed
whether
the
crew
of
the
strange
sloop
just
then
effecting
a
landing
in
small
boats
were
friends
or
enemies
it
was
impossible
to
guess
jeremy
feared
for
the
sheep
fresh
meat
would
be
welcome
to
any
average
ship
crew
and
the
lad
had
no
doubt
that
they
would
use
no
scruple
in
dealing
with
a
youngster
of
his
age
he
must
know
who
they
were
and
whether
they
intended
crossing
the
island
there
was
no
feeling
of
mere
adventure
in
his
heart
now
it
was
purely
sense
of
duty
that
drove
his
trembling
legs
down
the
hillside
he
shivered
miserably
in
the
night
air
and
felt
for
his
which
gave
him
scant
comfort
illustration
the
ridge
which
has
already
been
described
bore
in
a
southerly
direction
from
the
base
of
the
ledge
and
sloped
steeply
to
the
head
of
the
southern
inlet
high
above
the
arm
of
the
bay
where
the
sloop
was
now
moored
and
scarcely
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
shore
the
ridge
projected
in
a
rough
granite
crag
like
a
bent
knee
jeremy
had
a
very
fair
plan
of
all
this
in
his
mind
for
his
trained
woodsman
eye
had
that
afternoon
noted
every
landmark
and
photographed
it
he
followed
this
mental
map
as
he
stumbled
through
the
trees
it
seemed
a
long
time
perhaps
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
before
he
came
out
stifling
the
sound
of
his
gasping
breath
and
crouched
for
a
minute
on
the
bare
stone
to
get
his
wind
then
he
crawled
forward
along
the
rough
cliff
top
feeling
his
way
with
his
hands
soon
he
heard
a
distant
shout
a
faint
glow
of
light
shone
over
the
edge
of
the
crag
as
he
drew
near
he
saw
on
the
beach
below
a
great
fire
of
driftwood
and
some
score
or
more
of
men
gathered
in
the
circle
of
light
the
distance
was
too
great
for
him
to
tell
much
about
their
faces
but
jeremy
was
sure
that
no
english
or
colonial
would
be
manned
by
such
a
motley
company
their
clothes
varied
from
the
and
sailor
jerkin
of
the
average
mariner
to
slashed
leather
breeches
of
antique
cut
and
red
cloth
skirts
reaching
from
the
girdle
to
the
knees
some
of
the
group
wore
hats
others
seamen
caps
of
rough
wool
and
here
and
there
a
face
grimaced
from
beneath
a
twisted
rag
rakishly
askew
everywhere
about
them
the
fire
gleamed
on
of
one
kind
or
another
nearly
every
man
carried
a
hanger
at
his
side
and
most
had
one
or
two
pistols
tucked
into
waistband
or
holster
this
desperate
gang
was
in
a
constant
commotion
even
as
jeremy
watched
a
half
dozen
men
were
rolling
a
barrel
up
the
beach
wild
howls
greeted
its
appearance
and
as
it
was
hustled
into
the
circle
of
bright
light
those
who
had
been
dancing
quarreling
and
throwing
dice
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
fell
over
each
other
to
join
the
mob
that
surrounded
it
the
leaping
flames
threw
a
weird
uncertain
brilliance
upon
the
scene
that
made
jeremy
blink
his
eyes
to
be
sure
that
it
was
real
with
every
moment
he
had
become
more
certain
what
manner
of
men
these
were
his
lips
moved
to
shape
a
single
terrible
word
pirates
the
buccaneers
were
much
talked
of
in
those
days
and
though
the
new
england
ports
were
less
troubled
because
better
guarded
than
those
farther
south
there
had
been
many
hanged
in
boston
within
jeremy
memory
as
if
to
clinch
the
argument
a
dozen
of
the
ruffians
swung
their
cannikins
of
rum
in
the
air
and
began
to
shout
a
song
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
all
the
words
that
reached
jeremy
were
oaths
except
one
phrase
at
the
end
of
the
refrain
repeated
so
often
that
he
began
to
make
out
the
sense
of
it
walk
the
bloody
beggars
all
below
it
seemed
to
be
or
overboard
he
could
not
tell
which
either
seemed
bad
enough
to
the
boy
just
then
and
he
turned
to
crawl
homeward
with
a
sick
feeling
at
the
pit
of
his
stomach
his
way
led
straight
back
across
the
ridge
to
the
spring
and
thence
down
to
the
shelter
on
the
north
shore
he
made
the
best
speed
he
was
able
through
the
woods
until
he
reached
the
height
of
land
near
the
middle
of
the
island
he
had
crashed
along
caring
only
to
reach
the
and
home
but
as
he
stood
for
a
moment
to
get
his
breath
and
his
bearings
the
westerly
breeze
brought
him
a
sound
of
voices
on
the
ridge
close
by
he
prayed
fervently
that
the
wind
which
had
warned
him
had
served
also
to
carry
away
the
sound
of
his
progress
cowering
against
a
tree
he
stood
perfectly
still
while
the
voices
there
seemed
to
be
two
came
nearer
and
nearer
one
was
a
very
deep
rough
bass
that
laughed
hoarsely
between
speeches
the
other
voice
was
of
a
totally
different
sort
with
a
cool
even
tone
and
a
rather
precise
way
of
clipping
the
words
see
here
david
jeremy
understood
the
latter
to
say
it
for
you
to
remember
those
bearings
not
me
you
the
sailor
here
give
them
again
now
huh
grunted
big
voice
two
hunder
an
ten
north
to
a
sharp
rock
an
five
northeast
by
east
to
an
oak
tree
in
a
gully
two
an
thirty
north
to
a
fir
tree
blazed
on
the
south
five
north
there
you
are
he
ended
in
a
chuckle
as
if
pleased
by
the
accuracy
of
his
figures
ay
well
enough
the
other
responded
but
it
must
be
wrong
for
here
the
blazed
tree
and
no
spring
by
it
close
below
jeremy
saw
their
lantern
flash
and
a
moment
later
the
two
men
were
in
full
view
striding
among
the
trees
as
he
had
almost
expected
from
their
voices
one
was
a
tremendous
bearded
fellow
in
and
jerkin
and
with
a
villainous
turban
over
one
eye
while
his
companion
was
a
lean
man
dressed
in
a
fine
buff
coat
breeches
and
hose
and
shoes
with
gleaming
buckles
they
must
have
passed
within
ten
feet
of
the
terrified
jeremy
while
the
tossing
lantern
swung
from
the
hairy
fist
of
the
man
called
david
shone
all
too
distinctly
upon
the
boy
huddled
shape
when
they
were
gone
by
he
allowed
himself
a
sigh
of
relief
and
shifted
his
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other
a
twig
broke
loudly
and
both
men
stopped
and
listened
was
nought
growled
david
the
other
man
paid
no
attention
to
him
other
than
to
say
hold
you
the
lantern
here
and
advanced
straight
toward
jeremy
tree
the
boy
froze
against
it
immovable
but
it
was
of
no
avail
aha
said
the
lean
man
quietly
and
gripped
the
lad
arm
with
his
hand
as
he
dragged
him
into
the
light
his
companion
came
up
staring
with
astonishment
a
moment
he
was
speechless
then
began
ripping
out
oath
after
oath
under
his
breath
how
he
asked
at
length
did
the
blarsted
whelp
come
here
the
smaller
man
who
had
been
looking
keenly
into
jeremy
face
suddenly
addressed
him
here
you
speak
up
do
you
live
here
he
cried
ay
said
the
boy
beginning
to
get
a
grip
on
his
thoughts
how
long
has
there
been
a
settlement
here
there
was
none
last
autumn
continued
the
man
jeremy
had
recovered
his
wits
and
reasoned
quickly
he
had
little
chance
of
escape
for
the
present
while
he
must
at
all
costs
keep
the
sheep
safe
so
he
lied
manfully
praying
the
while
to
be
forgiven
is
a
new
colony
he
mumbled
a
great
new
colony
from
boston
town
there
be
three
ships
of
forty
guns
each
in
the
north
harbor
and
they
be
watching
for
pirates
in
these
parts
he
finished
boy
growled
the
bearded
man
seizing
jeremy
wrist
and
twisting
it
horribly
boy
are
you
telling
the
truth
with
face
white
and
set
and
knees
trembling
from
the
pain
the
lad
nodded
and
kept
his
voice
steady
as
he
groaned
an
ay
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
scowling
the
giant
broke
silence
we
best
haul
out
now
he
said
and
so
i
believe
the
other
replied
but
the
are
empty
here
as
he
turned
to
jeremy
show
us
the
spring
it
was
not
far
away
and
the
boy
found
it
without
trouble
now
dave
herriot
said
the
captain
stay
you
here
with
the
light
that
we
may
return
hither
the
easier
boy
come
with
me
make
no
fuss
either
or
be
the
worse
for
you
and
so
saying
he
walked
quickly
back
toward
the
southern
shore
holding
the
stumbling
jeremy
wrist
in
a
grip
of
iron
crashing
down
the
hill
through
the
brush
the
lad
had
scant
time
or
will
for
observing
things
about
him
but
as
they
crossed
a
gully
he
saw
or
fancied
he
saw
on
the
crag
above
the
slouched
figure
of
a
buccaneer
silhouetted
against
the
sky
it
was
not
the
bearded
giant
called
herriot
but
another
jeremy
was
sure
he
had
no
time
for
conjectures
for
they
plunged
into
the
thicket
and
birch
limbs
whipped
him
across
the
face
chapter
v
the
events
of
that
night
made
a
terribly
clear
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
young
new
englander
years
afterward
he
would
wake
with
a
shiver
imagining
that
the
relentless
hand
of
the
pirate
captain
was
again
dragging
him
toward
an
unknown
fate
it
must
have
been
the
darkness
and
the
sudden
unexpectedness
of
it
all
that
frightened
him
for
as
soon
as
they
came
down
the
rocks
into
the
flaring
firelight
he
was
able
to
control
himself
once
more
the
wild
carouse
was
still
in
progress
among
the
crew
fierce
faces
with
unkempt
beards
and
cruel
lips
leered
redly
from
above
hairy
naked
chests
eyes
lit
from
within
by
liquor
and
from
without
by
the
dancing
flames
gleamed
below
black
brows
many
of
the
men
wore
earrings
and
metal
bands
about
the
knots
of
their
while
silver
flashed
everywhere
as
the
captain
strode
into
the
center
of
this
group
the
swinging
chorus
fell
away
to
a
single
drunken
voice
which
kept
on
uncertainly
from
behind
the
silence
said
the
captain
sharply
the
voice
dwindled
and
ceased
all
was
quiet
about
the
fire
men
went
on
jeremy
captor
clear
heads
all
for
this
is
no
time
for
drinking
we
have
found
this
boy
upon
the
hill
who
tells
of
a
fleet
of
armed
ships
not
above
a
league
from
here
we
must
set
sail
within
an
hour
and
be
out
of
reach
before
dawn
every
man
now
take
a
and
follow
me
you
job
howland
keep
the
boy
and
the
watch
here
on
the
beach
fresh
commotion
broke
out
as
he
finished
ay
ay
captain
bonnet
came
in
a
broken
chorus
as
the
crew
partially
sobered
by
the
words
hurried
to
the
where
a
line
of
small
kegs
lay
in
the
sand
a
moment
later
they
were
gone
plowing
up
the
hillside
jeremy
stood
where
he
had
been
left
a
tall
pirate
in
the
most
picturesque
attire
strolled
over
to
the
boy
side
and
looked
him
up
and
down
with
a
roguish
grin
under
his
cloak
jeremy
had
on
fringed
leather
breeches
and
tunic
such
as
most
of
the
northern
colonists
wore
the
pirate
seeing
the
rough
moccasins
and
deerskin
trousers
burst
into
a
roar
ho

woodcock
and
how
do
ye
like

illustration
ho
ho
young
woodcock
and
how
do
ye
like

company

the
lad
said
nothing
shut
his
jaw
hard
and
looked
the
big
buccaneer
squarely
in
the
face
there
was
no
fear
in
his
expression
the
man
nodded
and
chuckled
approvingly
that
pluck
boy
that
pluck
said
he
we
clip
the
young
cock
and
maybe
make
a
pirate
of
him
yet
he
stooped
over
to
feel
the
buckskin
fringe
on
jeremy
leg
the
boy
hand
went
into
his
shirt
like
a
flash
he
had
pulled
out
the
pistol
and
cocked
it
when
he
felt
both
legs
snatched
from
under
him
his
head
hit
the
ground
hard
and
he
lay
dazed
for
a
second
or
two
when
he
regained
his
senses
job
howland
stood
astride
of
him
coolly
tucking
the
pistol
into
his
own
ay
said
job
ye
be
a
fine
buccaneer
only
ye
should
have
struck
with
the
butt
i
heard
the
click
the
pirate
seemed
to
hold
no
grudge
for
what
had
occurred
and
sat
down
beside
jeremy
in
a
friendly
fashion
free
tradin
ai
what
it
was
he
confided
when
billy
kidd
cleared
for
the
southern
seas
twenty
years
agone
they
say
he
had
papers
from
the
king
himself
and
no
dared
come
anigh
him
he
swore
gently
and
reminiscently
as
he
went
on
to
detail
the
recent
severities
of
the
massachusetts
government
and
the
insecurity
of
buccaneers
about
the
virginia
capes
they
do
say
tho
as
edward
teach
that
they
call
blackbeard
is
plumb
thick
with
all
the
magistrates
and
planters
in
carolina
an
sails
the
seas
as
safe
as
if
he
had
a
fleet
of
twenty
ships
said
job
we
sailed
along
with
him
for
a
spell
last
year
but
him
an
the
old
man
could
make
shift
to
agree
ye
see
this
blackbeard
is
so
used
to
havin
his
own
way
he
wanted
to
run
stede
bonnet
too
that
made
stede
boilin
but
we
was
undermanned
just
then
and
had
to
bide
our
time
to
cut
loose
bonnet
ye
see
is
short
on
seamanship
but
long
in
his
sword
arm
do
ye
never
anger
him
he
terrible
to
watch
when
he
raised
dave
herriot
sails
the
ship
mostly
but
when
we
sight
a
big
merchantman
with
maybe
a
long
nine
or
two
aboard
then
when
stede
bonnet
comes
on
deck
that
frenchman
we
sunk
tonight
blast
her
bloody
spars
here
the
lank
pirate
interrupted
himself
to
curse
his
luck
and
continued
probably
loaded
with
sugar
and
jamaica
rum
from
martinique
and
headed
up
for
the
french
provinces
well
we
never
know
that
sure
he
paused
bit
off
the
end
of
a
rope
of
black
tobacco
and
meditatively
surveyed
the
boy
i
from
new
england
myself
said
he
after
a
time
sailed
honest
out
of
providence
port
when
i
was
a
bit
bigger
nor
you
then
when
i
was
growed
and
an
able
seaman
on
a
virginia
bark
in
the
african
trade
along
comes
ben
hornygold
the
great
rover
of
those
days
and
picks
us
up
twelve
of
the
likeliest
he
takes
on
his
ship
the
rest
he
maroons
somewhere
south
of
the
cubas
and
sends
our
bark
into
charles
town
under
a
prize
crew
so
i
took
to
buccaneering
and
i
must
own
i
always
found
it
a
fine
occupation
not
to
say
that
it
made
me
rich
maybe
it
might
if
i
kept
all
my
sharin
illustration
job
howland
this
delivered
almost
in
one
breath
had
caused
howland
an
immense
amount
of
trouble
with
his
quid
of
tobacco
which
nearly
choked
him
as
he
finished
except
for
the
sound
of
his
vast
expectorations
the
pair
on
the
beach
were
quiet
for
what
seemed
to
jeremy
a
long
while
then
on
the
rocks
above
was
heard
the
clatter
of
shoes
and
the
bumping
of
kegs
job
rose
grasping
the
hand
of
his
charge
and
they
went
to
meet
the
returning
sailors
to
the
young
woodsman
utterly
unused
to
the
ways
of
the
sea
the
next
was
a
bewildering
mêlée
of
hurrying
sweating
toil
with
orders
and
oaths
and
the
glimmer
of
a
dying
fire
over
all
the
scene
he
was
rowed
to
the
sloop
with
the
first
boatload
and
there
job
howland
set
him
to
work
passing
into
the
hold
he
had
had
no
rest
in
over
twenty
hours
and
his
whole
body
ached
as
the
last
barrel
bumped
through
the
hatch
all
the
crew
were
aboard
and
a
knot
of
swaying
bodies
turned
the
windlass
to
the
rhythm
of
a
muttered
chanty
the
chain
creaked
and
rattled
over
the
bits
till
the
dripping
anchor
came
out
of
water
and
was
swung
inboard
the
mainsail
and
foresail
went
up
with
a
bang
as
a
dozen
stalwart
pirates
manned
the
halyards
dave
herriot
stood
at
the
helm
abaft
the
cabin
companion
and
his
bull
voice
roared
the
orders
as
he
swung
her
head
over
and
the
breeze
steadied
in
the
tall
sails
look
alive
there
mates
he
bellowed
stand
by
now
to
set
the
main
jib
like
most
of
the
pirate
stede
bonnet
was
she
carried
fore
and
main
of
the
old
square
style
and
her
long
main
boom
and
immense
spread
of
jib
gave
her
a
tremendous
sail
area
for
her
tonnage
the
breeze
had
held
steadily
since
sundown
and
was
if
anything
rising
a
little
short
seas
slapped
and
gurgled
at
the
forefoot
with
a
pleasant
sound
jeremy
desperately
tired
had
dropped
by
the
mast
scarcely
caring
what
happened
to
him
the
sloop
slid
out
past
the
dark
headlands
and
heeled
to
leeward
with
a
satisfied
grunt
of
her
cordage
that
came
gently
to
the
boy
ears
his
head
sank
to
the
deck
and
he
slept
dreamlessly
chapter
vi
a
rough
hand
shook
him
awake
he
was
lying
in
a
dingy
bunk
somewhere
in
the
gloom
of
the
cramped
forecastle
come
growled
a
voice
strange
to
jeremy
you
slept
the
clock
around
wants
you
aft
the
lad
ached
in
all
his
bones
as
he
rolled
over
toward
the
light
as
he
came
to
a
sitting
position
on
the
edge
of
the
bunk
he
gave
a
start
for
the
face
scowling
down
at
him
looked
utterly
fiendish
to
his
sleepy
eyes
its
ugliness
fairly
shocked
him
awake
the
man
had
a
grim
bristly
jaw
and
a
twisted
mouth
his
eyes
were
small
and
cruel
so
light
in
color
that
they
looked
unspeakably
cold
the
livid
gray
line
of
a
ran
from
his
left
eyebrow
to
his
right
cheek
and
his
nose
was
crushed
inward
where
the
scar
crossed
its
bridge
giving
him
more
the
look
of
an
animal
than
of
a
man
a
greasy
red
cloth
bound
his
head
and
produced
a
final
touch
of
barbarity
to
the
jeremy
there
seemed
something
strangely
familiar
about
his
pose
but
as
he
still
stared
he
was
jerked
to
his
feet
by
the
collar
do
stand
there
you
lubber
shouted
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
get
aft
an
lively
a
hard
shove
sent
the
boy
spinning
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
he
climbed
dizzily
and
stumbled
on
deck
looking
about
him
uncertain
where
to
go
it
must
have
been
past
noon
for
the
sun
was
on
the
starboard
bow
the
was
and
running
southwest
on
a
fresh
west
wind
dave
herriot
leaned
against
the
weather
rail
a
short
clay
pipe
in
one
fist
and
his
bushy
brown
beard
in
the
other
at
the
wheel
was
a
swarthy
man
with
earrings
who
looked
like
a
portuguese
or
a
spaniard
glancing
over
his
shoulder
jeremy
saw
most
of
the
crew
lolled
about
forward
of
the
hatch
herriot
looked
up
and
called
him
gruffly
but
not
unkindly
the
boy
thought
he
advanced
close
to
the
staggering
a
little
on
the
uneven
footing
now
look
sharp
lad
said
the
pirate
in
a
stern
voice
and
mind
what
i
tell
there
nought
to
fear
aboard
this
sloop
for
them
as
does
what
they
told
we
run
square
an
fair
an
while
major
stede
bonnet
and
david
herriot
gives
the
orders
no
man
harm
ye
and
a
hard
look
came
into
the
tanned
face
if
there
any
runnin
for
shore
now
and
come
time
to
ye
there
or
if
ever
ye
takes
it
in
yer
head
to
disobey
orders
we
ye
straight
and
think
no
more
about
it
you
big
and
strong
an
may
make
a
foremast
hand
for
the
first
on
it
until
ye
get
your
sea
legs
ye
can
be
a
sort
o
cabin
boy
wants
ye
below
now
quick
jeremy
scrambled
down
the
companionway
indicated
by
a
gesture
of
herriot
pipe
there
was
a
door
on
each
side
and
one
at
the
end
of
the
small
passage
he
advanced
and
knocked
at
this
last
one
and
was
told
in
the
captain
clear
voice
to
open
major
bonnet
sat
at
a
good
mahogany
table
in
the
middle
of
the
cabin
behind
him
were
a
bunk
two
chairs
and
a
rack
of
small
arms
containing
half
a
dozen
guns
four
brace
of
pistols
and
several
swords
he
had
been
reading
a
book
evidently
one
of
the
score
or
more
which
stood
in
a
case
on
the
right
jeremy
gasped
for
he
had
never
seen
so
many
books
in
all
his
life
as
the
captain
looked
up
a
stern
frown
came
over
his
face
never
a
particularly
merry
one
the
boy
ignorant
as
he
was
of
pirates
could
not
help
feeling
that
this
man
quietly
gentle
appearance
fitted
but
ill
with
the
reputation
he
bore
his
clothes
were
of
good
quality
and
cut
his
grayish
hair
neatly
tied
behind
with
a
black
bow
and
worn
unpowdered
his
face
was
long
and
austere
like
a
boston
preacher
thought
jeremy
and
although
the
forehead
above
the
intelligent
eyes
was
high
and
broad
there
was
a
strange
lack
of
humor
in
its
vertical
wrinkles
well
my
lad
said
the
cool
voice
at
last
you
aboard
the
and
a
long
way
from
your
settlement
so
you
might
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
how
long
you
aboard
depends
on
your
behavior
we
might
put
into
the
chesapeake
and
if
there
are
no
cutters
about
consider
setting
you
ashore
but
if
you
like
the
sea
and
take
to
it
there
room
for
a
hand
in
the
then
again
if
you
try
any
tricks
you
leave
us
feet
first
over
the
rail
he
leaned
forward
and
hissed
slightly
as
he
pronounced
the
last
words
something
in
the
eyes
under
his
knotted
gray
brows
struck
deeper
terror
into
the
heart
than
either
herriot
threat
or
the
cruel
face
of
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
for
that
instant
bonnet
seemed
deadly
as
a
snake
illustration
stede
bonnet
jeremy
was
much
relieved
when
he
was
bidden
to
go
the
stood
by
the
companionway
as
he
ascended
you
bunk
he
remarked
curtly
go
up
with
the
crew
now
the
boy
slipped
into
the
crowd
that
lay
around
the
windlass
as
unobstrusively
as
he
could
a
bearded
man
with
a
great
hairy
chest
bare
to
the
yellow
sash
at
his
waist
was
speaking
ay
he
said
a
hundred
indians
was
dead
in
the
town
before
ever
we
landed
they
did
know
where
to
run
except
into
the
huts
an
those
our
plowed
through
like
so
much
grass
which
was
what
they
was
mostly
then
old
johnny
buck
piped
the
longboat
overside
and
on
shore
we
went
firin
all
the
time
vane
himself
with
a
dirk
in
his
teeth
and
sword
an
pistol
out
goes
swearin
up

roadway
an
we
behind

our

stickin
in

a
few
come
out
shootin
their
little
arrers
at
us
but
we
herded
drove
yellin
all
the
time
at
close
quarters
their
knives
was
no
match
for
cutlasses
so
we
went
slashin
through
the
town
burnin
out
an
stickin
when
they
ran
our
sword
arms
was
red
to
shoulder
that
day
but
we
was
like
men
far
gone
in
rum
an
never
stayed
while
an
indian
held
up
head
then
we
dropped
and
slept
where
we
fell
across
a
corp
like
as
not
clean
tuckered
every
man
of
us
come
mornin
the
sight
and
smell
of
the
place
made
us
sober
enough
and
not
a
man
in
the
crew
wanted
to
go
further
into
the
island
there
was
no
gold
in
the
town
neither
all
we
got
was
a
few
hogs
and
sheep
we
left
the
same
day
for
it
come
on
hot
an
we
had
no
way
to
clean
up
the
mess
that
island
must
ha
been
a
nuisance
to
the
whole
caribbean
for
weeks

work
vane
a

man
i
told

his
worst
he
was
interrupted
by
a
villainous
old
with
a
sparse
fringe
of
white
beard
who
sprawled
by
the
hatchway
he
cleared
his
throat
hoarsely
and
spoke
with
a
deep
wheeze
between
sentences
all
that
was
nowt
to
our
fight
off
panama
in
the
spring
of
he
growled
we
were
slaughterin
indians

they
were
three
good
barks
and
nigh
three

he
was
his
cutlass

tryin
to
climb
the

side
with

when
our

boarded

of

we
was
standin
in

full
of
bullet
holes
into

stocky
young
deserter
from

in
his
eyes
gleaming
greedily
at
the
thought
of
the

that
was
in

he
cried

we
took
off

last
summer
eighty
years
old
he
was
and
marooned
there
for
half
his
life
he
was
with
morgan
at
the
great
sack
of
old

before
most
on

an
it
still
after

a
month

o

the
man
with
the
broken
nose
raised
himself
from
his
place
by
the
capstan
and
stretched
his
hairy
arms
with
an
evil
leering
yawn
every
eye
turned
to
him
and
there
was
silence
on
the
deck
as
he
began
to
speak

never
knifed

after
i
do

the
scarred

stopped
with
the

abruptness
that
had
marked

slowly
around

to

was
utterly
and
forlornly
seasick
here
young
he
said
kindly
the
rail
chapter
vii
bright
summer
weather
hovered
over
the
atlantic
as
the
ploughed
smartly
southward
jeremy
grew
more
accustomed
to
his
new
manner
of
life
from
day
to
day
and
as
he
found
his
he
began
to
take
a
great
pleasure
in
the
free
salt
wind
that
sang
in
the
rigging
the
blue
sparkle
of
the
swells
and
the
circling
whiteness
of
the
offshore
gulls
he
was
left
much
to
himself
for
the
captain
demanded
his
services
only
at
meal
times
and
to
set
his
cabin
in
order
in
the
morning
in
the
long
intervals
the
boy
sat
inconspicuous
in
a
corner
of
the
watching
the
gayly
dressed
ruffians
of
the
crew
as
they
threw
dice
or
quarrelled
noisily
over
their
winnings
he
was
assigned
to
no
watch
but
usually
went
below
at
the
same
time
as
job
howland
thus
keeping
out
of
the
way
of
daggs
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
as
howland
was
in
the
port
watch
on
deck
from
sunset
to
midnight
jeremy
often
took
comfort
in
the
sight
of
his
loved
stars
wheeling
westward
through
the
taut
shrouds
he
would
stand
there
with
a
lump
in
his
throat
as
he
thought
of
his
father
anguish
on
returning
to
the
island
to
find
the
sheep
uncared
for
and
the
young
shepherd
vanished
in
a
region
desolate
as
that
he
knew
that
there
was
but
one
conclusion
for
them
to
reach
still
they
might
find
the
ashes
of
the
pirate
fire
and
keep
up
a
hope
that
he
yet
lived
but
the
boy
could
not
be
unhappy
for
long
he
would
find
his
way
home
soon
and
he
fairly
shivered
with
delight
as
he
planned
the
grand
reunion
that
would
take
place
when
he
should
return
perhaps
he
even
imagined
himself
marching
up
to
the
door
in
sailor
blue
cloth
with
a
seaman
cloak
and
cocked
hat
pistol
and
cutlass
in
his
belt
and
a
hundred
gold
guineas
in
his
poke
not
for
worlds
would
he
have
turned
pirate
but
the
romance
of
the
sea
had
touched
him
and
he
could
not
help
a
flight
of
fancy
now
and
then
sometimes
in
the
long
hours
of
the
watch
job
would
give
him
lessons
in
seamanship
teach
him
the
names
of
ropes
and
spars
and
show
how
each
was
used
the
boy
greatest
delight
was
to
steer
the
ship
when
job
took
his
trick
at
the
helm
this
was
no
small
task
for
a
boy
even
as
strong
as
jeremy
the
sloop
like
all
of
her
day
had
no
wheel
but
was
fitted
with
a
massive
hand
tiller
a
great
curved
beam
of
wood
that
kicked
amazingly
when
it
was
free
of
its
lashings
of
course
no
grown
man
could
have
held
it
in
a
seaway
but
during
the
calm
summer
nights
jeremy
learned
to
humor
the
craft
along
her
mainsail
just
drawing
in
the
gentle
land
breeze
and
her
head
held
steadily
south
a
point
west
one
night
it
was
perhaps
a
week
after
jeremy
capture
and
they
had
been
sighting
low
bits
of
land
on
both
bows
all
day
dave
herriot
came
on
deck
about
the
middle
of
the
watch
and
told
curley
the
jamaican
second
mate
he
might
go
below
he
set
job
to
take
soundings
and
himself
taking
the
tiller
swung
her
over
to
port
with
the
wind
abeam
jeremy
went
to
the
bows
where
he
could
see
the
white
line
of
shore
ahead
they
drew
in
steering
by
job
soundings
and
by
the
time
the
watch
changed
were
ready
to
cast
anchor
in
a
small
sandy
bay
herriot
came
forward
scowling
darkly
under
his
bushy
eyebrows
and
rumbling
an
occasional
oath
to
himself
the
sloop
her
anchor
down
and
sails
furled
swung
idly
on
the
tide
the
men
were
clearly
mystified
as
the
started
to
give
orders
george
dunkin
he
said
take
ten
men
of
the
starboard
watch
and
go
ashore
to
forage
there
be
farms
near
here
and
any
pigs
or
fowls
you
may
come
across
will
be
welcome
you
bill
livers
addressing
the
ship
painter
take
a
lantern
and
your
and
come
aft
with
me
all
the
rest
stay
on
deck
and
keep
a
double
lookout
alow
an
aloft
the
forage
party
slipped
quietly
off
toward
the
beach
in
one
of
the
boats
the
remainder
of
the
crew
looked
blankly
after
the
retreating
bill
livers
hm
murmured
job
has
stede
bonnet
gone
crazy
and
as
herriot
let
the
painter
down
over
the
bulwark
at
the
stern
ay
goin
to
change
her
name
by
the
great
bull
whale
an
hour
before
dawn
the
crew
of
the
returned
grumbling
and
herriot
appeared
preoccupied
with
some
weightier
matter
and
scarcely
deigned
to
notice
their
failure
by
swearing
there
was
no
singing
as
the
anchor
was
raised
a
sort
of
gloom
hung
over
the
whole
ship
as
she
stole
out
to
sea
again
the
men
one
by
one
went
aft
and
leaned
outboard
peering
down
at
the
broad
squat
stern
jeremy
did
likewise
and
beheld
in
new
white
letters
on
the
black
of
the
hull
the
words
next
day
in
the
council
he
learned
why
the
renaming
of
the
had
cast
a
pall
of
apprehension
over
the
crew
there
were
tales
of
disaster
of
storm
shipwreck
and
fire
and
that
dread
of
all
sailors
the
unknown
fate
of
ships
that
never
come
back
to
port
apparently
the
rule
was
unfailing
sooner
or
later
the
ship
that
had
been
given
a
new
name
would
come
to
grief
and
her
crew
with
her
pharaoh
daggs
cast
an
eye
of
hatred
at
jeremy
and
growled
that
one
jonah
was
enough
to
have
abroad
without
clean
drownin
all
the
luck
this
way
while
the
crew
looked
black
and
shifted
uneasily
in
their
places
the
bay
where
they
had
anchored
overnight
must
have
been
somewhere
on
the
eastern
end
of
long
island
a
favorite
landing
place
for
pirates
at
that
time
all
day
they
cruised
along
the
hilly
southern
shore
the
men
seemed
unable
to
cast
off
the
gloom
that
had
settled
upon
them
stede
bonnet
sat
in
his
cabin
never
once
coming
on
deck
and
drinking
hard
a
thing
unusual
for
him
jeremy
who
saw
more
of
him
than
any
of
the
foremast
hands
realized
from
his
gray
set
face
that
the
man
was
under
a
terrible
strain
of
some
sort
he
told
job
what
he
had
seen
and
the
tall
new
englander
looked
very
thoughtful
he
took
the
boy
aside
there
be
mutiny
in
this
crew
before
another
night
he
whispered
they
never
stand
for
what
he
done
if
it
comes
to
handspikes
you
and
i
best
watch
our
chance
to
clear
out
pharaoh
daggs
do
love
us
a
mite
but
the
mutiny
was
destined
not
to
occur
an
hour
before
noon
next
day
the
lookout
constantly
stationed
in
the
bows
gave
a
loud
sail
ho
and
as
dave
herriot
the
shout
all
hands
tumbled
on
deck
with
a
rush
chapter
viii
as
the
pirate
sloop
raced
southward
under
full
sail
the
form
of
the
other
ship
became
steadily
plainer
she
was
a
brig
and
and
apparently
deeply
laden
major
bonnet
who
had
come
up
at
the
first
warning
seemed
his
old
cool
self
as
he
conned
the
enemy
through
a
spyglass
jeremy
had
been
detailed
as
a
sort
of
errand
boy
and
as
he
stood
at
the
captain
side
he
heard
him
speaking
to
herriot
she
british
right
enough
he
was
saying
i
can
make
out
her
flag
but
how
many
guns
is
harder
to
tell
she
sees
us
now
i
think
for
they
seem
to
be
shaking
out
a
topsail
ah
now
i
can
see
the
sun
shine
on
her
broadside
two
three
five
in
the
lower
port
tier
and
three
more
above
sixteen
in
all
be
a
fight
it
seems
aboard
the
the
men
were
slaving
like
ants
preparing
for
the
battle
every
man
knew
his
duties
the
gunners
and
swabbers
were
putting
their
cannon
in
fettle
below
decks
others
were
rolling
out
from
the
hold
and
storing
powder
in
lockers
behind
the
guns
great
tubs
of
sea
water
were
placed
conveniently
in
the
and
blankets
were
put
to
soak
for
use
in
case
of
fire
buckets
of
vinegar
water
for
swabbing
the
guns
were
laid
handy
in
the
galley
the
cook
made
hot
grog
cutlasses
were
looked
after
pistols
cleaned
and
loaded
and
muskets
set
out
for
close
firing
jeremy
was
sent
hither
and
thither
on
every
imaginable
mission
a
tremendous
excitement
running
in
his
veins
the
sloop
gained
rapidly
on
her
prey
hauling
over
to
windward
as
she
sailed
and
when
the
two
ships
were
almost
within
cannon
range
stede
bonnet
with
his
own
hand
bent
the
jolly
roger
to
the
lanyard
and
sent
the
great
black
flag
with
its
skull
and
crossbones
to
fly
from
the
masthead
the
grog
was
served
out
no
man
would
have
believed
that
the
roaring
rollicking
gang
of
cutthroats
who
tossed
off
their
liquor
in
cheers
and
ribald
laughter
was
identical
with
the
grumbling
crew
of
twenty
hours
before
as
they
finished
something
came
skipping
over
the
water
astern
and
the
first
echoing
report
followed
close
the
cannonade
was
on
a
loud
yell
of
defiance
swept
the
length
of
the
as
the
men
went
to
their
posts
the
gun
decks
ran
along
both
sides
of
the
sloop
a
few
feet
above
the
water
line
they
were
like
alleyways
beneath
the
main
deck
barely
wide
enough
to
admit
the
passage
of
a
man
or
a
keg
of
powder
behind
the
these
latter
were
not
fixed
to
the
planking
as
afterward
became
the
fashion
but
ran
on
trucks
and
were
kept
in
their
places
by
rope
tackles
in
action
the
recoil
had
to
be
taken
up
by
men
who
held
the
ends
of
these
ropes
rove
through
pulleys
in
the
vessel
side
despite
their
efforts
the
gun
would
sometimes
leap
back
against
the
bulkhead
hard
enough
to
shatter
it
as
the
charge
for
each
reloading
had
to
be
carried
sometimes
half
the
length
of
the
ship
by
hand
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
men
who
served
the
guns
needed
some
strength
and
agility
in
getting
past
the
jumping
carriages
jeremy
was
sent
below
to
help
the
gunners
as
the
shot
from
the
merchantman
continued
to
scream
by
job
howland
was
a
gunner
on
the
port
side
and
the
boy
naturally
lent
his
services
to
the
one
man
aboard
that
he
could
call
his
friend
there
was
much
bustle
in
the
alley
behind
the
closed
ports
but
surprisingly
little
confusion
was
apparent
the
discipline
seemed
better
than
at
any
time
since
the
boy
had
been
brought
aboard
the
black
sloop
job
was
ramming
the
wad
home
on
the
charge
of
powder
in
his
bow
gun
the
other
four
guns
in
the
port
deck
were
being
loaded
at
the
same
time
three
men
tending
each
one
here
lad
sang
out
job
as
he
put
the
single
iron
shot
in
at
the
muzzle
take
one
o
the
wet
blankets
out
o
yon
tub
an
stand
by
to
fight
sparks
jeremy
did
as
he
was
bid
then
got
out
of
the
way
as
the
ports
were
flung
open
and
the
guns
run
forward
with
their
evil
bronze
noses
thrust
out
into
the
sunlight
the
sloop
running
swiftly
with
the
wind
abeam
had
now
drawn
abreast
of
her
unwieldy
adversary
the
merchant
captain
apparently
finding
himself
and
being
unable
to
spare
his
gun
crews
to
trim
sails
had
put
the
head
of
his
ship
into
the
wind
where
she
stood
with
canvas
flapping
her
bows
offering
a
steady
mark
to
the
pirate
ready
a
port
broadside
came
bonnet
ringing
order
and
then
fire
job
howland
blazing
match
went
to
the
at
the
word
and
his
roaring
merrily
jumped
back
two
good
feet
against
the
straining
ropes
of
the
tackle
instantly
the
next
gun
spoke
and
the
next
and
so
on
all
five
in
a
space
of
a
bare
ten
seconds
had
they
been
fired
simultaneously
they
might
have
shaken
the
ship
to
pieces
jeremy
was
and
his
whole
body
was
jarred
thick
black
smoke
hung
in
the
alleyway
for
the
ports
had
been
closed
in
order
to
reload
in
greater
safety
the
boy
felt
the
deck
heel
to
starboard
under
him
and
thought
at
first
that
a
shot
had
caught
them
under
the
waterline
but
when
he
was
sent
above
to
find
out
whether
the
broadside
had
taken
effect
he
found
that
the
sloop
had
come
about
and
was
already
driving
north
still
to
windward
of
the
enemy
bonnet
was
giving
his
gunners
more
time
to
load
by
running
back
and
forth
and
using
his
batteries
alternately
herriot
had
the
tiller
and
in
response
to
jeremy
question
he
pointed
to
the
fluttering
rags
of
the
brig
foresail
and
the
smoke
that
issued
from
a
splintered
hole
under
her
bow
chains
below
in
the
gun
deck
the
buccaneers
sweating
by
their
pieces
heard
the
news
with
cheers
the
sloop
shook
to
the
jarring
report
of
the
starboard
battery
a
moment
later
and
hardly
had
it
ceased
when
she
came
about
on
the
other
tack
hurrah
cried
job
mates
we
show
him
this
time
wind
an
water
wind
an
water
the
open
traps
showed
the
green
seas
swirling
past
close
below
and
off
across
the
swells
the
tall
side
of
the
merchantman
swaying
in
the
trough
of
the
waves
ready
came
the
order
and
every
gunner
jumped
to
the
breach
match
in
hand
before
the
command
came
to
fire
there
was
a
crash
of
splintering
wood
and
a
long
intermittent
roar
came
over
the
water
the
brig
had
taken
advantage
of
her
falling
off
the
wind
to
deliver
a
broadside
in
her
own
turn
stede
bonnet
voice
cool
as
ever
gave
the
order
and
four
guns
answered
the
brig
discharge
the
crew
of
the
middle
cannon
lay
on
the
deck
in
a
pitiable
state
two
killed
outright
and
the
gunner
bleeding
from
a
great
splinter
wound
in
the
head
a
shot
had
entered
to
one
side
of
the
port
tearing
the
planking
to
bits
and
after
striking
down
the
two
had
passed
into
the
jeremy
jumped
forward
with
his
blanket
in
time
to
stamp
out
a
blaze
where
the
had
been
dropped
and
with
the
help
of
one
of
the
pirates
dragged
the
wounded
man
to
his
berth
almost
every
shot
of
the
last
volley
had
done
damage
aboard
the
brig
her
freeboard
twice
as
high
as
that
of
the
sloop
had
offered
a
target
which
for
expert
gunners
was
hard
to
miss
jagged
openings
showed
all
along
her
side
and
as
she
rose
on
a
swell
job
shouted
see
there
she
leakin
now
was
my
last
shot
did
that
right
on
her
waterline
all
hands
on
deck
to
board
her
came
a
shout
almost
at
the
same
instant
jeremy
hurrying
up
with
the
rest
found
the
sloop
bearing
down
straight
before
the
wind
and
only
a
dozen
boat
lengths
from
the
enemy
a
wild
whoop
went
up
among
the
pirates
every
man
had
seized
on
a
musket
and
was
crouching
behind
the
rail
bonnet
alone
stood
on
the
open
deck
his
buff
coat
blowing
open
and
his
hand
resting
lightly
on
his
sword
an
occasional
cannon
shot
screamed
overhead
or
splashed
away
astern
apparently
the
brig
batteries
were
too
greatly
damaged
and
her
crew
too
badly
shot
up
to
offer
an
effective
bombardment
she
was
drifting
helplessly
under
tattered
ribbons
of
canvas
and
the
whose
sails
had
suffered
far
less
bore
down
upon
her
opponent
with
the
swoop
of
a
hawk
as
she
drew
close
aboard
a
scattered
fusillade
of
small
arms
broke
out
from
the
brig
poop
wounding
one
man
a
portuguese
but
for
the
most
part
striking
harmlessly
against
the
bulwark
the
buccaneers
held
their
fire
till
they
were
scarce
a
boat
length
distant
then
at
the
order
they
swept
the
ship
with
a
withering
musket
volley
the
brig
was
down
by
the
head
and
lay
almost
bow
on
so
that
her
deck
was
exposed
to
marksmen
herriot
brought
his
sloop
about
like
a
flash
and
almost
before
jeremy
realized
what
was
toward
the
ships
had
bumped
together
side
by
side
and
the
howling
mob
of
pirates
was
swarming
over
the
enemy
rail
job
howland
and
another
man
took
great
with
which
they
grappled
the
brig
ports
and
kept
the
two
vessels
from
drifting
apart
jeremy
was
alone
upon
the
sloop
deck
he
put
the
thickness
of
the
mast
between
him
and
the
hail
of
bullets
and
peered
fearfully
out
at
the
terrible
scene
above
illustration
dave
herriot
the
crew
of
the
brig
had
been
too
much
disorganized
to
repel
the
boarders
as
well
as
they
might
and
the
entire
horde
of
wild
barbarians
had
scrambled
to
her
deck
where
a
perfect
inferno
now
held
sway
the
air
seemed
full
of
flying
cutlasses
that
produced
an
incessant
hiss
and
clangor
pistols
banged
deafeningly
at
close
quarters
and
there
was
the
constant
undertone
of
groans
cries
and
bellowed
oaths
above
the
din
came
the
terrible
clear
voice
of
stede
bonnet
urging
on
his
seadogs
he
had
become
a
different
man
from
the
moment
his
foot
touched
the
merchantman
deck
from
the
cool
commander
he
had
changed
to
a
devil
incarnate
with
face
distorted
eyes
aflame
and
a
sword
that
hacked
and
stabbed
with
the
swift
ferocity
of
lightning
jeremy
saw
him
fighting
with
three
men
his
long
sword
played
in
and
out
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
with
a
turn
and
a
flash
then
whirling
swiftly
pinned
a
man
who
had
run
up
behind
bonnet
feet
moved
quickly
shifting
ground
as
stealthily
as
a
cat
and
in
a
second
he
had
leaped
to
a
safer
position
with
his
back
to
the
two
of
his
opponents
were
down
and
the
third
fighting
wearily
and
without
confidence
when
a
huge
man
burst
from
the
hatch
to
the
deck
and
swung
his
broad
cutlass
to
such
effect
that
the
battling
groups
in
his
path
gave
way
to
either
side
the
burly
form
of
dave
herriot
opposed
the
new
enemy
and
as
the
two
giants
squared
off
sword
ringing
on
sword
more
than
one
wounded
sailor
raised
himself
to
a
better
position
grinning
with
the
unquenchable
love
of
a
fair
fight
herriot
was
no
mean
swordsman
of
the
rough
and
ready
type
and
had
a
great
physique
as
well
but
his
previous
labors
he
had
been
the
first
man
on
board
and
had
already
accounted
for
a
fair
share
of
the
defenders
had
rendered
him
slow
and
the
ready
parrying
blade
to
blade
ceased
suddenly
as
his
foot
slipped
backward
in
a
pool
of
blood
the
blond
seaman
seized
his
advantage
and
swung
a
slicing
blow
that
glanced
off
herriot
forehead
and
felled
the
huge
buccaneer
to
the
deck
where
he
lay
stunned
the
quick
red
staining
his
as
the
man
stepped
forward
to
finish
the
business
a
long
keen
straight
blade
interposed
caught
his
cutlass
in
an
upward
parry
and
at
the
same
time
pinked
him
painfully
in
the
arm
jumping
back
the
seaman
found
himself
faced
by
the
pitiless
eyes
of
stede
bonnet
who
had
killed
his
last
opponent
and
run
in
to
save
his
mate
life
that
quick
darting
sword
baffled
the
sailor
swing
and
hack
as
he
might
his
blows
were
caught
in
midair
and
fell
away
harmless
while
always
the
relentless
point
drove
him
back
and
back
forced
to
the
rail
he
stood
his
ground
desperately
pale
and
glistening
with
the
sweat
of
a
man
in
the
fear
of
death
then
his
sword
flew
up
the
pirate
captain
stabbed
him
through
the
throat
and
with
a
dying
gasp
the
limp
body
fell
backward
into
the
sea
meanwhile
the
pirates
had
steadily
gained
ground
in
the
hand
to
hand
struggle
and
now
a
bare
brave
fellows
held
on
fighting
singly
or
in
pairs
back
to
back
the
brig
captain
wounded
in
several
places
and
seeing
his
crew
in
a
fair
way
to
be
annihilated
flung
up
a
tired
arm
and
cried
for
quarter
almost
at
once
the
fighting
ceased
and
half
the
combatants
utterly
exhausted
sank
down
among
their
dead
and
wounded
fellows
the
deck
was
a
long
shambles
red
from
the
bits
to
the
poop
while
the
hands
of
the
prisoners
were
being
bound
bonnet
and
all
of
his
men
not
otherwise
employed
hurried
below
to
search
for
loot
the
man
who
had
held
the
astern
left
this
task
and
greedily
clambered
up
the
brig
side
lest
he
should
miss
his
chance
at
the
booty
job
alone
stuck
to
his
post
and
motioned
jeremy
to
stay
where
he
was
cheers
and
yells
of
joy
rang
from
the
of
the
merchantman
where
the
pirates
had
evidently
discovered
the
ship
store
of
wine
after
a
few
moments
pharaoh
daggs
thrust
his
scarred
face
out
of
the
companion
and
with
a
fierce
roar
of
laughter
waved
a
black
bottle
above
his
head
the
others
followed
drinking
and
babbling
curses
and
last
of
all
stede
bonnet
pale
dishevelled
mad
with
blood
and
liquor
stood
bareheaded
by
the
hatch
he
raised
his
hand
in
a
gesture
of
silence
and
all
the
hubbub
ceased
we
have
beaten
them
he
cried
between
twitching
lips
i
captain
thomas
the
chiefest
of
all
the
pirates
and
my
of
the
we
show
all
we
show
all

and
all
the
rest
he
he
he
and
his
voice
trailed
off
in
crazy
laughter
the
men
of
the
crew
stood
about
him
on
the
brig
deck
dumbfounded
by
his
words
jeremy
could
hardly
breathe
in
his
surprise
suddenly
he
gave
a
start
and
would
have
cried
out
but
that
job
hand
closed
his
mouth
a
swiftly
widening
lane
of
water
separated
the
sloop
from
her
late
enemy
chapter
ix
as
she
cleared
the
side
of
the
waterlogged
merchantman
the
began
to
move
her
sails
which
had
been
left
flapping
during
the
close
fighting
now
filled
with
a
bang
and
she
went
away
smartly
on
the
starboard
tack
job
had
dragged
jeremy
aft
and
the
two
were
huddled
at
the
tiller
partially
screened
by
the
mainsail
when
a
howl
of
consternation
broke
out
aboard
the
brig
few
if
any
of
the
firearms
were
still
loaded
or
they
might
have
been
shot
to
death
out
of
hand
as
it
was
the
sloop
had
drawn
away
to
a
distance
of
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
any
effort
was
made
to
stop
her
then
a
single
cannon
roared
and
a
round
shot
whizzed
by
along
the
tops
of
the
waves
when
the
next
report
came
jeremy
could
see
the
splash
fall
far
astern
they
were
out
of
range
the
two
runaways
now
felt
comparatively
safe
it
was
certain
that
the
brig
was
too
badly
damaged
to
give
chase
even
if
she
could
keep
afloat
jeremy
felt
a
momentary
pang
at
the
thought
of
leaving
even
that
graceless
crowd
in
such
jeopardy
but
he
remembered
that
they
had
the
brig
boats
in
which
to
leave
the
hulk
and
his
own
present
danger
soon
gave
him
enough
to
occupy
him
job
lashed
the
tiller
and
going
to
the
lanyard
at
the
mainmast
hauled
down
the
black
flag
then
they
both
set
to
work
cleaning
up
the
deck
the
three
dead
men
were
given
sea
burial
slipped
overboard
without
other
ceremony
than
the
short
prayer
for
each
which
jeremy
repeated
the
gunner
who
lay
in
agony
in
his
berth
had
his
wound
bound
up
and
was
given
a
sip
of
brandy
then
the
lank
new
englander
went
below
to
get
a
meal
while
jeremy
sluiced
the
gun
decks
with
sea
water
night
was
falling
when
job
reappeared
on
deck
with
biscuit
and
beans
and
some
preserves
out
of
the
captain
locker
there
was
little
appetite
in
jeremy
after
what
he
had
witnessed
that
day
but
his
tall
friend
ate
his
supper
with
a
relish
and
seemed
quite
elated
at
the
prospect
of
the
voyage
to
shore
he
filled
a
clay
pipe
after
the
meal
and
smoked
meditatively
awhile
then
addressed
the
boy
with
a
queer
hesitancy
sonny
he
began
since
we
picked
you
up
i
been
thinkin
every
day
more
an
more
what
i
give
to
be
back
at
your
age

piratin
seemed
a
fine
upstandin
trade
to
me
when
i
begun
independent
an
adventurous
too
it
seemed
but
it
not
so
fine
not
so
fine
he
paused
one
or
two
or
maybe
five
years
o
rough
livin
an
rougher
fightin
a
powerful
waste
o
money
in
drink
such
an
in
the
end
a
dog
death
by
shootin
or
starvation
or
the
chains
on
execution
dock
another
pause
followed
and
then
turning
suddenly
to
jeremy
lad
i
can
get
a
governor
pardon
ashore
but
mean
nought
to
me
if
my
old
days
came
back
to
trouble
me
young
an
you
honest
an
what
more
you
believe
in
god
do
you
figger
a
man
can
square
himself
after
livin
like
i
lived
the
boy
looked
into
the
pirate
homely
anxious
face
he
felt
that
he
would
always
trust
job
howland
ay
he
answered
straightforwardly
and
put
out
his
hand
the
man
gripped
it
with
a
sort
of
fierce
eagerness
that
was
good
to
see
and
smiled
the
smile
of
a
man
at
peace
with
himself
then
he
solemnly
drew
out
his
and
pricked
a
small
cross
in
the
skin
of
his
forearm
that
said
he
is
for
a
sign
that
once
i
get
out
o
this
here
pickle
i
never
pirate
nor
no
more
the
wind
sank
to
a
mere
breath
as
the
darkness
gathered
and
jeremy
stood
the
first
watch
while
his
tired
friend
settled
into
a
deep
sleep
that
lasted
till
he
was
wakened
a
little
after
midnight
then
the
boy
took
his
turn
at
sleeping
when
the
morning
light
shone
into
his
eyes
he
woke
to
find
job
pacing
the
deck
and
casting
troubled
looks
at
the
sky
the
wind
was
dead
and
only
an
occasional
whiff
of
light
air
moved
the
idly
swinging
canvas
a
tiny
swell
rocked
the
sloop
as
gently
as
a
cradle
well
my
boy
we
wo
get
far
toward
shore
at
this
gait
said
job
cheerfully
as
jeremy
came
up
except
for
maybe
three
hours
sailin
last
night
we
made
no
progress
at
all
i
got
some
porridge
cooked
below
you
bring
it
on
deck
an
we
have
a
snack
the
meal
finished
they
turned
to
the
rather
trying
task
of
waiting
for
a
breeze
about
noon
job
climbed
to
the
masthead
for
a
reconnaissance
and
on
coming
down
reported
a
sail
to
the
east
but
no
sign
of
any
wind
the
sky
was
dull
and
overcast
so
that
job
made
no
effort
to
determine
their
bearings
they
figured
that
they
had
drifted
a
dozen
or
more
to
the
west
since
the
battle
and
were
lying
somewhere
off
the
little
port
of
new
york
the
day
passed
job
amusing
jeremy
with
tales
of
his
adventures
and
old
and
soon
night
had
overtaken
them
again
this
time
the
boy
had
the
first
nap
he
was
roused
to
take
his
watch
when
job
saw
by
the
stars
that
it
was
eight
bells
and
still
yawning
with
sleep
the
lad
went
to
stand
by
the
rail
everything
was
quiet
on
the
sea
and
even
the
swell
had
died
out
leaving
a
perfect
calm
there
was
no
moon
the
boy
head
sank
on
his
breast
and
softly
he
slid
to
the
deck
drowsiness
had
overcome
him
so
gently
that
he
slept
before
he
knew
he
was
sleepy
chapter
x
jeremy
first
waking
sensation
was
the
sound
of
a
hoarse
confused
shout
and
the
rattle
of
oars
being
shipped
he
struggled
to
his
feet
staring
into
the
dark
astern
almost
at
the
same
instant
there
came
a
series
of
bumps
along
the
sloop
side
and
as
the
boy
rushed
to
the
hatch
to
call
his
ally
he
heard
feet
pounding
the
deck
job
he
cried
job
and
then
a
heavy
hand
smote
him
on
the
mouth
and
he
lost
consciousness
for
a
time
the
period
during
which
he
stood
awake
and
terrified
had
been
so
brief
and
so
fraught
with
terror
that
it
never
seemed
real
to
the
lad
in
memory
there
was
something
of
the
awful
hopelessness
of
nightmare
about
it
always
afterward
he
had
difficulty
in
convincing
himself
that
he
had
not
slept
steadily
from
the
time
he
drowsed
on
watch
to
the
minute
when
he
opened
his
eyes
to
the
light
of
morning
and
felt
his
aching
head
throb
against
the
hard
deck
as
he
lay
staring
at
the
sky
a
footstep
approached
and
some
one
stood
over
him
he
turned
his
eyes
painfully
to
look
and
beheld
the
dark
bearded
visage
of
george
dunkin
the
who
scowled
angrily
and
kicked
him
in
the
ribs
with
a
heavy
toe
get
up
ye
young
lubber
roared
the
man
and
swore
fiercely
as
the
boy
unable
to
move
still
lay
upon
his
back
a
moment
later
the
went
away
to
jeremy
numb
consciousness
came
the
realization
that
the
pirates
had
caught
them
again
the
words
of
the
captain
on
his
first
day
aboard
came
back
to
the
lad
and
made
him
shudder
there
had
been
stories
current
among
the
men
that
gave
a
glimpse
of
how
stede
bonnet
dealt
with
those
who
were
treacherous
which
of
a
dozen
awful
deaths
was
in
store
for
him
ah
if
only
they
would
spare
the
torture
he
thought
that
he
could
die
bravely
a
worthy
scion
of
dauntless
stock
he
thought
of
job
who
must
have
been
seized
in
his
bunk
below
the
poor
fellow
was
to
have
short
happiness
in
his
changed
way
of
life
it
seemed
jeremy
tried
to
steel
his
nerves
against
the
test
he
was
sure
must
follow
soon
instead
of
going
to
pieces
in
terror
he
succeeded
in
forcing
himself
to
the
attitude
of
a
young
stoic
he
had
done
nothing
of
which
he
was
ashamed
and
he
felt
that
if
he
was
called
to
face
a
just
god
in
the
next
hours
he
would
be
able
to
hold
his
head
up
like
a
man
time
passed
and
he
heard
a
heavy
tramp
coming
along
the
deck
he
was
hoisted
roughly
by
hands
under
his
and
placed
upon
his
feet
though
he
was
still
too
weak
to
stand
without
support
a
dozen
faces
surrounded
him
glaring
angrily
out
of
a
sort
of
mist
that
partly
obscured
his
vision
came
the
terrible
leer
of
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
the
twisted
mouth
opened
and
the
man
spoke
with
a
deliberate
ugliness
the
very
absence
of
oaths
seemed
to
make
his
slow
speech
more
deadly
ah
ye
misbegotten
young
fool
he
said
so
there
ye
stand
scared
like
the
cowardly
spawn
ye
are
we
took
ye
and
kept
ye
and
fed

by

at
this
moment
a
second
party
of
pirates
poured
swearing
out
of
the
hatch
dragging
job
howland
in
their
midst
he
was
stripped
to
his
shirt
and
and
had
apparently
received
a
few
bruises
in
the
tussle
below
jeremy
spirits
were
momentarily
revived
by
seeing
that
some
of
the
buccaneers
had
suffered
like
inconveniences
while
the
young
was
gingerly
feeling
of
a
shapeless
blob
that
had
been

from

the
victim
was
dragged
completely
under
the
ship
bottom
scraping
over
the
jagged
barnacles
and
drawn
up
on
the
other
side
more
often
dead
than
living
as
the
sloop
had
only
fore
and
aft
sails
they
had
merely
run
a
rope
under
the
bottom
bringing
both
ends
together
amidships
they
now
dragged
the
boy
forward
still
in
a
condition
and
made
fast
his
feet
in
a
loop
in
one
end
of
the
rope
then
stretching
his
arms
along
the
deck
in
the
other
direction
bound
his
wrists
in
a
similar
way
he
was
practically
made
a
part
of
the
ring
of
hemp
that
circled
the
ship

without

ceremony
other
than

parting
kick

the

took
their

at

to

to

he
set
his
teeth
and
a
wordless
prayer
went
up
from
his
heart
the
wrench
of
the
rope
at
his
ankles
never
came
as
he
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
a
voice
broke
the
quiet
if

starts
to

on

turned
his

and

his

ashen

and
trembling
but
with
a
venomous
fire
in

held

and
two

were
thrust
into

not

to

just

there

a

of
feet
behind

over

down
the
jersey
coast
at
once
jeremy
got
to
his
bunk
as
best
he
might
and
slept
for
the
greater
part
of
hours
when
he
awoke
the
crew
had
just
finished
breakfast
and
were
sitting
every
man
by
himself
counting
out
gold
pieces
bonnet
had
divided
the
booty
found
on
the
brig
and
in
their
greedy
satisfaction
the
pirates
were
for
the
time
at
least
utterly
oblivious
to
former
discontent
when
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
galley
for
breakfast
jeremy
was
ignored
by
his
fellows
or
treated
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
indeed
there
had
been
little
real
ground
for
wishing
to
punish
the
boy
aside
from
the
ugly
temper
occasioned
by
having
to
row
a
night
and
a
day
in
open
boats
only
pharaoh
daggs
bore
real
malice
toward
jeremy
and
his
feelings
were
for
the
most
part
concealed
under
a
mask
of
contemptuous
indifference
as
the
day
progressed
the
lad
found
that
matters
had
resumed
their
accustomed
course
and
that
he
was
in
no
immediate
danger
he
missed
his
brave
friend
and
as
bitterly
as
if
he
had
been
a
brother
but
partially
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
job
act
in
jumping
overboard
had
probably
spared
him
the
awful
torture
of
the
keel
or
some
worse
death
the
captain
would
never
have
defended
the
runaway
sailor
as
he
had
done
jeremy
the
boy
was
certain
all
day
the
sloop
made
her
way
south
at
a
brisk
rate
occasionally
sighting
low
white
beaches
to
starboard
sometime
in
the
first
her
boom
went
over
and
she
ran
her
slim
nose
in
past
cape
may
heading
up
the
delaware
with
the
hurrying
tide
while
the
towing
behind
swung
into
her
wake
astern
chapter
xi
when
the
gang
of
buccaneers
had
tumbled
down
the
hatch
after
cry
of
warning
job
howland
barely
awake
had
leaped
to
the
narrow
angle
that
made
the
forward
end
of
the
seizing
a
pistol
as
he
went
intrenching
himself
behind
a
chest
with
the
bulkhead
behind
him
and
on
both
sides
he
had
kept
the
maddened
crew
at
bay
for
several
moments
the
pistol
covering
the
only
path
of
attack
made
them
wary
of
approaching
too
close
when
finally
a
jumped
forward
at
once
he
pulled
the
trigger
only
to
find
that
the
weapon
had
not
been
loaded
in
desperation
he
grasped
the
muzzle
in
his
hand
and
struck
out
fiercely
with
the
heavy
butt
beating
off
his
assailants
time
after
time
this
was
well
enough
at
first
but
the
buccaneers
who
cared
much
less
for
a
broken
crown
than
for
a
bullet
wound
pressed
in
closer
and
closer
striking
with
fists
and
it
was
soon
over
they
jammed
him
so
far
into
the
corner
than
his
tireless
arm
no
longer
had
free
play
and
then
bore
him
down
under
sheer
weight
of
numbers
when
he
ceased
to
struggle
they
seized
him
fast
and
carried
him
to
the
deck
job
was
out
of
breath
and
much
bruised
but
had
suffered
no
lasting
hurt
he
saw
jeremy
led
forward
heard
the
men
cries
and
realized
that
the
torture
was
in
store
for
them
both
unbound
but
helpless
to
interfere
he
saw
the
boy
stretched
on
the
deck
and
the
rope
attached
to
his
arms
and
legs
he
suffered
greater
agony
than
did
jeremy
as
the
crew
made
ready
to
begin
their
awful
work
for
he
had
seen
keelhauling
before
and
then
suddenly
stede
bonnet
was
standing
by
the
companion
and
the
ringing
shout
that
saved
the
boy
life
struck
on
job
ears
he
could
hardly
keep
from
cheering
the
captain
then
and
there
but
relief
at
jeremy
delivery
brought
with
it
a
return
of
his
quick
wits
he
himself
was
in
as
great
danger
as
ever
he
was
facing
aft
and
his
eye
roving
the
deck
for
a
means
of
escape
lit
on
the
brig
boat
which
the
pirates
had
tied
astern
after
reboarding
the
sloop
she
was
trailing
at
the
end
of
a
painter
her
bows
rising
and
falling
on
the
choppy
waves
he
waited
only
long
enough
to
see
that
the
captain
succeeded
in
freeing
jeremy
then
drew
a
great
breath
and
plunged
over
the
side
swimming
under
water
he
watched
for
the
towed
longboat
to
come
by
overhead
and
as
her
dark
bulk
passed
he
caught
her
keel
with
a
strong
grip
of
his
fingers
worked
his
way
back
and
came
up
gasping
his
hands
holding
to
the
rudder
ring
in
her
stern
the
hot
still
days
had
warmed
the
surface
of
the
sea
to
a
temperature
far
above
the
normal
or
he
must
certainly
have
become
exhausted
in
a
short
time
as
it
was
he
clung
to
his
ring
till
near
noon
when
cautiously
peering
above
the
gunwale
he
saw
the
sloop
deck
empty
save
for
a
steersman
half
asleep
in
the
hot
sun
by
the
tiller
with
a
great
wrench
of
his
arms
the
lifted
himself
over
the
stern
and
slipped
as
quietly
as
he
was
able
into
the
boat
bottom
there
he
lay
breathless
listening
for
sounds
of
alarm
aboard
the
sloop
none
came
and
after
a
few
moments
he
wriggled
forward
and
made
himself
snug
under
the
the
boat
carried
a
and
a
can
of
biscuit
for
emergency
use
after
refreshing
himself
with
these
and
drying
out
his
thin
clothing
in
the
sun
he
retreated
under
the
shade
of
the
thwart
and
slept
the
sleep
of
utter
fatigue
late
the
next
day
he
took
a
brief
observation
of
the
horizon
there
was
sandy
shore
to
the
east
and
from
what
he
knew
of
the
coast
and
the
ship
course
he
judged
they
must
be
nearing
the
entrance
to
delaware
bay
his
long
rest
had
restored
to
him
most
of
his
vigor
and
although
he
was
sore
in
many
places
he
felt
perfectly
ready
to
try
an
escape
as
soon
as
the
sloop
should
approach
the
land
and
offer
him
an
opportunity
as
the
night
went
on
the
made
good
speed
up
the
bay
aided
by
a
strong
tide
a
little
while
before
light
she
came
close
enough
to
the
west
shore
for
job
to
see
the
outlines
of
trees
on
a
bluff
he
figured
the
distance
to
be
not
above
a
mile
at
most
there
was
some
question
in
his
mind
whether
he
should
cut
the
painter
and
use
the
boat
in
getting
away
or
swim
for
it
he
decided
that
it
would
be
better
for
him
in
most
ways
if
the
pirates
still
supposed
him
dead
so
quietly
as
an
otter
he
slipped
over
the
gunwale
paddled
away
from
the
boat
side
and
set
out
for
the
land
ploughing
through
the
water
with
a
long
overarm
stroke
job
had
a
hard
fight
with
the
turning
tide
before
the
trees
loomed
above
his
head
and
his
feet
scraped
gravel
under
the
bank
when
at
last
he
crept
gasping
out
upon
dry
ground
it
was
miles
to
the
southward
of
his
first
destination
dawn
had
come
and
the
early
light
silvered
the
rippling
and
glinted
on
the
white
wings
of
the
gulls
the
big
mariner
shook
the
water
from
his
sides
like
a
spaniel
stretched
both
long
arms
to
the
warm
sky
laughed
as
he
thought
of
his
escape
and
turning
his
gaunt
face
to
the
northward
set
out
swiftly
along
the
bluffs
chapter
xii
meanwhile
the
was
far
up
inside
the
capes
sailing
demurely
along
the
ports
of
her
gun
deck
closed
and
the
british
colors
fluttering
from
her
top
jeremy
watched
the
shores
they
passed
with
deep
interest
he
wondered
if
there
would
be
a
chance
for
him
to
get
away
when
they
came
to
anchor
there
was
nothing
but
hardship
in
his
lot
aboard
the
sloop
now
that
job
was
gone
he
was
unnoticed
for
the
most
part
by
the
men
of
the
crew
and
when
any
of
them
spoke
to
him
it
was
with
a
cuff
or
a
curse
as
for
captain
bonnet
he
had
relapsed
into
one
of
his
black
moods
nothing
brought
him
on
deck
or
made
him
speak
except
to
give
herriot
monosyllabic
commands
late
the
following
day
after
a
slow
progress
along
the
delaware
shore
the
sloop
hove
to
in
a
wide
roadstead
and
the
anchor
was
run
out
the
steeples
and
shipping
of
a
little
town
were
visible
by
the
water
side
but
no
one
put
off
to
meet
them
to
the
surprise
of
all
bonnet
himself
came
on
deck
wearing
a
good
coat
and
fresh
ruffles
and
with
his
hair
powdered
he
ordered
the
gig
lowered
then
looked
about
the
assembled
crew
and
addressed
them
enough
now
my
lads
said
he
i
going
ashore
with
a
picked
boat
crew
to
get
what
news
there
is
about
you

go
with
me

that
you
are
of
the
honest
merchant

and
that
i
am

likewise
honest
navigator

separate
into
every
tavern
and
place
along
the
wharves
pick
up
the
names
of
all
ships
that
are
soon
to
sail
and
their
cargoes
and
meet
at
the
gig
at
eight
bells

and
you
men
aboard
here
keep
a
strict
watch
daggs
i
leave
the
boy
in
your
charge
do
let
him
out
of
your
sight
at
the
last
words
jeremy
heart
sank
to
his
boots
he
knew
how
futile
would
be
any
attempt
to
escape
under
the
cold
of
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
as
the
gig
put
off
from
the
sloop
side
the
boy
leaned
dejectedly
against
the
rail
pharaoh
daggs
slouched
up
to
him
ah
there
young
said
he
with
cynical
jocularity
just
o
leavin
us
were
ye
when
the
old
man
took
the
gimp
out
o
ye
the
bantering
note
vanished
from
the
man
voice
like
to
break
yer
neck
ye
young
whelp
but
i
wo
not
just
yet
he
seemed
to
be
licking
his
ugly
chops
at
the
thought
of
a
future
occasion
when
he
might
allow
himself
this
luxury
then
he
went
on
half
to
himself
it
seemed
hm
bonnet
a
queer
never
tell
what
he
do
them
eight
men
aboard
that
brig
now
never
was
a
rougher
piece
o
piracy
since
morgan
day
than
his
makin
those
beggars
walk
the
plank
stood
there
an
roared
an
laughed
he
did
an
pricked
behind
till
they
tipped
the
board
an
then
to
stop
us
from
drownin
a
blasted
little
rat
tried
to
kill
us
all
oh
he
bad
is
stede
bad
jeremy
gave
a
start
as
this
soliloquy
progressed
he
had
wondered
once
or
twice
what
had
become
of
the
prisoners
taken
aboard
the
brig
that
attempted
escape
of
job
had
cost
dear
in
human
life
it
seemed
and
his
own
deliverance
had
been
the
mere
whim
of
a
he
shuddered
and
thanked
god
fervently
for
the
fortune
that
had
so
far
attended
him
there
was
a
pause
while
the
buccaneer
seemed
to
regard
him
with
a
sort
of
crafty
hesitancy
at
length
he
spoke
see
here
boy
he
said
his
voice
sinking
to
a
hoarse
whisper
how
long
had
you
been
livin
on
that
there
island
jeremy
looked
up
wonderingly
not
long
he
answered
only
a
day
or
two
really
and
you
nor
none
of
yer
folks
never
went
nosin
there
to
find
nothin
did
yer
tell
me
the
truth
now
daggs
leaned
closer
a
murderous
intensity
in
his
face
no
said
jeremy
squirming
as
the
man
fingers
gripped
his
shoulder
the
pirate
gave
him
another
long
piercing
look
from
his
terrible
eyes
then
released
him
and
went
forward
where
he
stood
staring
off
toward
the
shore
in
his
wretched
loneliness
the
boy
sank
down
by
the
rail
his
heart
heavier
than
it
had
ever
been
in
his
whole
life
it
might
have
been
a
relief
to
him
to
cry
a
great
lump
was
in
his
throat
indeed
and
his
eyes
smarted
but
he
had
considered
himself
too
old
for
tears
almost
since
he
could
walk
and
now
with
the
realization
that
he
was
near
shedding
them
he
forced
his
shoulders
back
shut
his
square
jaw
and
resolved
that
he
would
be
a
man
come
what
might
darkness
settled
over
the
river
mouth
the
form
of
pharaoh
daggs
in
black
silhouette
against
the
gray
of
the
sky
sent
a
shudder
through
jeremy
he
recalled
with
startling
distinctness
the
solitary
man
he
had
seen
on
the
island
the
night
of
his
capture
the
two
figures
were
identical
pondering
the
boy
fell
asleep
it
was
some
four
hours
later
that
he
woke
to
the
sound
of
hurrying
oars
close
aboard
a
subdued
shout
came
across
the
water
the
voice
was
stede
bonnet
stand
by
to
take
us
on
he
cried
a
moment
later
the
gig
shot
into
sight
her
crew
rowing
like
mad
they
pulled
in
their
oars
swept
up
alongside
the
black
sloop
and
were
caught
and
pulled
aboard
by
ready
hands
cut
the
cable
cried
the
captain
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
deck
the
gig
was
swung
up
the
cable
chopped
in
two
and
the
mainsail
spread
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
was
bowling
along
down
the
roadstead
hardly
had
she
gotten
under
way
when
two
appeared
astern
and
amid
shouts
and
orders
to
surrender
from
their
crews
a
scattered
fusillade
of
bullets
came
aboard
no
one
on
the
sloop
was
hit
and
as
the
sails
began
to
draw
properly
the
pirate
craft
soon
left
her
pursuers
far
to
the
rear
jeremy
never
one
to
watch
others
work
had
lent
a
hand
wherever
he
was
best
able
during
the
rush
of
the
escape
when
the
sloop
was
well
out
of
range
and
the
excitement
had
subsided
he
turned
for
the
first
time
to
look
at
a
small
group
that
had
been
talking
amidships
two
of
the
figures
were
very
well
known
to
him
bonnet
and
herriot
the
light
of
a
lantern
which
the
latter
held
fell
upon
the
face
of
a
boy
no
older
than
jeremy
dressed
in
the
finest
clothes
the
young
new
englander
had
ever
seen
the
lad
face
was
dark
and
resolute
his
hair
black
smoothly
brushed
back
and
tied
behind
with
a
small
ribbon
his
blue
coat
was
of
velvet
neatly
cut
below
his
long
flowered
waistcoat
were
displayed
buff
velvet
breeches
and
silk
stockings
of
the
same
color
his
shoes
were
of
fine
leather
and
buckled
with
silver
in
response
to
the
oaths
and
rough
questions
of
the
two
pirates
the
lad
seemed
to
have
little
to
say
when
he
spoke
it
was
with
a
scornful
ring
in
his
voice
the
first
words
jeremy
heard
him
say
were
understand
it
soon
i
fancy
we
are
well
enough
known
along
the
bay
and
my
father
as
i
have
said
is
a
friend
of
the
governor
there
be
ten
ships
after
you
before
morning
herriot
put
back
his
head
and
roared
with
laughter
hear
the
young
braggart
he
shouted
ten
ships
for
such
a
baby
as
he
is
well
my
lad
said
the
captain
you
be
treated
well
enough
while
we
wait
for
the
money
to
be
paid
here
jeremy
as
the
young
backwoodsman
came
up
bonnet
continued
two
boys
aboard
is
bad
business
for
you
sure
to
be
scheming
to
get
away
however
it
be
helped
just
yet
and
mind
what
i
say
there
be
a
bullet
ready
for
the
first
one
that
tries
it
now
get
below
the
pair
of
you
glad
as
he
was
to
have
a
companion
of
his
own
age
aboard
jeremy
boylike
was
too
shy
to
say
anything
to
the
new
arrival
that
night
and
indeed
the
other
boy
seemed
to
class
him
with
the
rest
of
the
pirates
and
to
feel
some
repugnance
at
his
company
so
the
two
unfortunate
youngsters
slept
fitfully
side
by
side
until
broad
daylight
next
morning
chapter
xiii
the
salt
horse
which
was
served
out
for
breakfast
aboard
the
made
scant
appeal
to
the
delaware
boy
appetite
he
hardly
touched
the
portion
which
jeremy
offered
him
and
kept
up
his
pose
of
proud
aloofness
all
the
morning
it
is
scarcely
a
matter
for
wonder
that
he
did
not
at
once
make
friends
with
jeremy
the
latter
buckskin
breeches
and
moccasins
had
been
taken
from
him
when
he
came
aboard
and
he
was
now
clad
in
his
old
leather
tunic
a
pair
of
seaman
trousers
which
bagged
nearly
to
his
ankles
wrinkled
garterless
wool
socks
and
an
old
pair
of
buckled
shoes
stuffed
with
rags
to
make
them
fit
his
hair
never
very
manageable
had
received
little
attention
during
the
voyage
and
now
was
as
wild
and
rough
as
that
of
a
savage
it
would
have
required
a
long
second
glance
for
one
to
see
the
fine
qualities
of
grit
and
in
the
boy
keen
face
the
sloop
was
making
great
speed
down
the
middle
channel
of
the
bay
her
canvas
straining
in
a
fine
west
breeze
and
her
deck
canted
far
to
leeward
no
boy
could
long
withstand
the
pleasure
of
sailing
on
such
a
day
and
before
noon
the
young
stranger
had
given
in
to
a
consuming
desire
to
know
the
names
of
things
jeremy
now
had
the
whole
ship
by
heart
and
was
filled
with
joy
at
the
opportunity
of
talking
about
her
to
one
more
ignorant
than
himself
of
course
he
was
as
proud
of
the
as
if
he
owned
her
how
he
glowed
over
his
account
of
the
battle
with
the
brig
nothing
on
the
coast
could
outsail
the
sloop
he
was
sure
indeed
it
was
with
some
regret
that
he
admitted
a
hope
of
her
being
overtaken
by
the
delaware
boy
friends
and
he
was
divided
between
pride
and
despair
as
the
day
went
on
and
no
sail
appeared
to
the
north
by
noon
his
new
acquaintance
was
ravenously
hungry
as
was
to
be
expected
and
over
their
pannikins
of
soup
the
last
reserve
between
them
went
by
the
board
illustration
bob
are
you
his
son
asked
the
lad
nodding
toward
herriot
jeremy
laughed
and
described
his
adventure
from
the
beginning
while
the
other
marveled
are
they
holding
you
for
ransom
too
asked
he
as
the
story
ended
no
replied
jeremy
i
reckon
they
knew
as
soon
as
they
saw
me
that
there
was
much
money
to
be
gotten
in
my
case
as
i
figure
it
they
did
dare
leave
me
on
the
island
for
fear
have
those
three
after
them
both
boys
laughed
as
they
thought
of
the
flight
of
stede
bonnet
company
from
a
garrison
of
fifteen
sheep
well
said
the
delaware
boy
still
chuckling
you
know
most
of
my
story
already
my
father
is
clarke
curtis
of
new
castle
my
own
name
is
bob
father
owns
some
ships
in
the
east
india
trade
and
has
a
plantation
up
on
the
brandywine
creek
last
night
i
was
at
our
warehouse
by
the
wharves
father
was
inside
talking
to
one
of
his
captains
who
had
just
come
to
port
i
wanted
to
see
the
ship
she
a
three
or
four
times
as
big
as
this
and
fast
too
for
her
burden
well
i
went
down
on
the
dock
where
she
was
moored
there
was
nobody
around
and
no
lights
and
she
stood
up
above
the
all
dark
and
big
her
mainmast
is
as
high
as
our
church
steeple
you
know
and
i
was
just
looking
up
at
her
and
wondering
where
the
watchman
was
when
four
men
came
along
down
the
wharf
i
thought
perhaps
was
father
and
some
of
his
men
when
they
were
quite
close
that
biggest
one
herriot
stepped
up
to
me
and
before
i
could
shout
he
put
his
hand
over
my
mouth
and
held
me
they
gagged
me
fast
and
then
one
of
them
gave
a
whistle
long
and
low
pretty
soon
a
boat
came
up
to
the
dock
and
they
grabbed
me
and
put
me
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
they
paddled
along
to
another
wharf
and
took
aboard
some
more
men
and
then
started
to
row
out
as
fast
as
they
could
i
guess
those
boats
that
came
after
us
were
from
father
ship
he
must
have
missed
me
right
away
so
now
old
bonnet
or
thomas
or
whatever
his
name
is
thinks
he
going
to
get
a
fat
sum
out
of
me
that
all
of
my
story
so
far
but
there
be
another
chapter
yet
jeremy
for
both
their
sakes
sincerely
hoped
that
there
might
at
sunset
of
that
day
the
cleared
cape
henlopen
and
held
her
course
for
the
open
sea
while
behind
her
in
the
gathering
dusk
the
coast
grew
hazy
faded
out
was
gone
the
two
boys
sitting
late
into
the
first
watch
shivered
with
that
fine
ecstasy
of
adventure
that
can
come
only
in
the
shadowy
mystery
of
decks
and
the
long
whispering
ripple
of
a
following
sea
jeremy
who
hours
before
had
thought
of
the
ship
as
a
place
of
utter
desolation
would
not
now
have
changed
places
with
any
boy
alive
he
knew
perhaps
for
the
first
time
the
fulness
of
joy
that
comes
into
life
with
human
companionship
that
night
two
lads
at
least
had
golden
dreams
of
a
youthful
kind
ducats
and
doubloons
princesses
and
swords
awave
and
cannon
blazing
great
galleons
with
crimson
sails
no
wonder
that
they
were
smiling
in
their
sleep
when
george
dunkin
held
a
lantern
over
the
bunk
at
the
change
of
the
watch
chapter
xiv
the
day
came
in
dark
with
fog
which
changed
a
little
after
noon
to
driving
scud
the
wind
had
gone
around
to
the
northeast
and
freshened
steadily
driving
the
waves
in
from
the
sea
in
steep
gray
hills
quite
different
from
anything
jeremy
had
before
experienced
the
sloop
under
three
reefs
and
a
storm
jib
began
to
make
rough
weather
of
it
staggering
up
and
down
the
long
slopes
in
an
aimless
dizzy
fashion
that
made
jeremy
and
bob
very
unhappy
the
poor
young
new
englander
had
to
perform
his
regular
tasks
no
matter
how
he
felt
within
but
once
the
work
was
done
he
stumbled
forward
miserably
and
lay
upon
his
bunk
bob
was
too
wretched
to
talk
all
day
and
for
the
time
at
least
cared
very
little
whether
he
was
rescued
or
near
nightfall
jeremy
went
aft
to
serve
the
captain
supper
and
as
he
returned
along
the
reeling
wet
deck
in
the
gathering
dark
he
stopped
a
moment
to
look
off
to
windward
the
racing
white
tops
of
the
waves
gleamed
momentarily
and
vanished
he
was
appalled
at
their
height
while
the
little
vessel
surged
along
in
the
trough
great
slopes
of
foam
and
black
water
rose
on
either
beam
up
and
up
like
tossing
hillsides
then
would
come
the
staggering
climb
to
the
summit
and
for
a
dizzy
second
the
terrified
lad
clinging
to
a
shroud
could
look
for
miles
across
the
shifting
valleys
before
he
could
catch
his
breath
the
sloop
pitched
down
the
next
declivity
in
a
long
sickening
sag
and
rocked
for
a
brief
instant
at
the
foot
her
masts
swaying
in
a
great
arc
half
across
the
sky
then
she
began
to
ascend
shivering
and
the
boy
crept
to
his
bunk
where
he
fell
asleep
at
last
to
the
sound
of
screaming
wind
and
lashing
water
at
dawn
and
all
next
day
the
gale
swept
down
from
the
northeast
unabated
the
was
thick
with
tobacco
smoke
and
the
wet
reek
of
the
crew
for
only
the
steersman
and
the
lookout
would
stay
on
deck
bob
somewhat
recovered
from
his
seasickness
lay
in
his
bunk
and
heard
such
tales
of
plunder
and
savagery
on
the
high
seas
as
made
his
blood
run
cold
when
jeremy
came
dripping
down
the
ladder
early
that
afternoon
he
found
the
delaware
lad
staring
at
pharaoh
daggs
with
a
look
of
positive
terror
the
buccaneer
evil
face
was
lit
up
by
the
rays
of
the
smoky
lantern
hung
from
a
hook
in
one
of
the
deck
beams
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
table
his
heavy
shoulders
hunched
and
a
long
clay
pipe
in
his
teeth
that
night
he
was
saying
four
on
us
went
an
cut
sol
brig
down
from
where
they
hanged
him
we
got
away
down
to
the
sloop
an
out
to
sea
with
him
i
did
have
no
cause
to
love
the
old
devil
but
i
ha
hated
to
have
a
ghost
like
his
after
me
so
i
lent
a
hand
we
wrapped
him
up
decent
an
gave
him
from
his
own
deck
as
he
paced
for
thirty
year
an
he
said
with
a
snarl
and
to
face
jeremy
we
got
them
two
boys
on
deck
both
of
said
was
the
other
as
told
so
we
treated
fair
alike
we
stripped
an
laid
in
deep
with
the
cat
till
there
no
white
skin
left
above
the
waist
then
we
sluiced
with
sea
water
when
they
could
feel
pain
again
we
stretched
with
rope
an
windlass
till
one
died
was
a
tough
young
devil
an
took
such
a
deal
of
it
that
we
had
to
brain
him
with
a
handspike
at
the
last
even
the
crew
were
silenced
for
a
little
by
this
recital
jeremy
and
bob
shivered
in
their
places
hardly
daring
to
breathe
then
a
portuguese
spoke
from
the
corner
his
greedy
little
black
eyes
glittering
in
his
swarthy
face
where
wass
da
money
da
gold
divide
eh
daggs
gave
a
little
start
and
leaned
forward
scowling
who
said
he
had
any
he
asked
savagely
sol
brig
kept
himself
to
himself
he
never
told
secrets
to
any
man
aboard
then
he
turned
and
with
a
black
frown
at
the
two
boys
climbed
through
the
hatch
into
the
howling
smother
outside
jeremy
always
alert
saw
one
or
two
glances
exchanged
among
the
pirates
before
the
interminable
foul
stream
of
talk
resumed
its
course
but
apparently
the
incident
of
the
scarred
man
abrupt
departure
was
soon
forgotten
as
the
storm
continued
bonnet
and
herriot
gave
up
their
attempts
to
sail
the
and
contented
themselves
with
keeping
her
afloat
the
gale
was
driving
them
southward
at
a
good
rate
and
they
were
not
ungrateful
as
they
reflected
that
it
must
have
effectually
put
a
stop
to
all
pursuit
toward
night
the
wind
went
down
a
trifle
though
the
seas
still
ran
in
veritable
mountain
ranges
the
dawn
of
the
following
day
showed
a
clear
sky
to
the
north
and
every
prospect
of
fair
weather
before
breakfast
all
hands
were
set
to
shaking
out
reefs
and
trimming
sails
a
task
which
the
tossing
of
the
sloop
made
unusually
difficult
new
halyards
had
to
be
fitted
in
some
places
otherwise
the
vessel
herself
had
suffered
but
little
the
brig
boat
towed
astern
all
through
the
flight
down
the
bay
had
been
swamped
and
cut
loose
on
the
first
day
of
storm
however
as
the
had
two
boats
of
her
own
lashed
on
deck
this
was
not
considered
a
real
loss
when
the
sun
was
high
enough
herriot
took
his
bearings
and
gave
the
helmsman
orders
to
keep
her
headed
west
a
point
north
the
sloop
made
a
long
beat
of
it
to
starboard
thrashing
up
all
night
and
most
of
the
following
day
before
she
sighted
the
virginia
capes
slipping
through
under
cover
of
darkness
bonnet
resumed
his
rôle
of
sober
merchantman
and
sailed
the
up
the
chesapeake
under
the
british
flag
with
a
fine
air
of
honesty
jeremy
and
bob
regained
their
spirits
as
the
low
shores
unrolled
ahead
and
passed
astern
with
an
occasional
glimpse
of
a
plantation
house
or
a
village
at
the
water
edge
as
every
fresh
estuary
and
arm
of
the
bay
opened
on
the
bow
the
lads
hoped
and
expected
that
the
sloop
would
enter
bob
thought
the
chances
for
escape
or
rescue
would
be
much
increased
if
they
came
to
anchor
in
some
harbor
jeremy
remembered
the
captain
to
free
him
when
they
reached
the
chesapeake
and
although
he
would
have
been
loth
to
part
from
his
new
friend
he
felt
that
he
might
render
him
better
service
ashore
than
in
his
company
aboard
the
pirate
it
was
two
full
days
before
the
order
was
finally
given
to
anchor
they
had
put
into
the
mouth
of
a
wide
inlet
far
up
on
the
eastern
shore
and
bonnet
had
her
brought
into
the
wind
at
a
good
distance
from
either
side
the
banks
were
high
and
wooded
and
as
far
as
the
boys
could
see
there
was
no
sign
of
habitation
anywhere
about
their
minds
were
both
busy
planning
some
way
of
getting
to
land
when
dave
herriot
came
up
behind
them
and
put
a
huge
hand
into
the
collar
of
each
come
along
below
lads
he
said
gruffly
they
went
completely
mystified
until
the
big
thrust
them
before
him
into
the
port
gun
deck
then
jeremy
understood
the
arrangement
of
iron
bars
called
the
bilboes
was
fastened
to
the
bulkhead
at
the
bow
end
of
the
alleyway
it
had
two
or
three
sets
of
iron
shackles
chained
to
it
and
into
the
smallest
pair
of
these
meant
for
the
wrists
of
a
grown
victim
he
locked
an
ankle
of
each
of
the
boys
ye
stay
a
while
till
we
sail
again
herriot
remarked
as
he
departed
the
lads
stared
at
each
other
too
glum
to
speak
bob
was
pale
with
rage
at
what
he
considered
a
dishonor
while
the
yankee
boy
heart
was
heavy
as
he
thought
of
the
opportunities
for
flight
he
had
let
slip
on
the
voyage
up
the
bay
within
half
an
hour
after
the
anchor
was
dropped
the
young
prisoners
heard
the
creak
of
the
davit
blocks
and
a
moment
later
the
splash
of
a
boat
taking
water
close
to
the
nearest
jeremy
stretched
as
far
as
his
chain
would
allow
and
through
a
crevice
saw
four
men
start
to
row
toward
shore
there
was
some
coarse
jesting
and
laughter
on
deck
then
one
of
the
crew
sent
a
fare
ye
well
bill
after
the
departing
gig
the
hail
was
answered
by
the
voice
of
the
jamaican
curley
half
an
hour
later
the
boat
returned
carrying
only
three
jeremy
straining
at
his
tether
made
out
that
curley
was
not
one
of
them
he
sat
down
thoughtful
well
bob
he
said
at
last
whether
it
about
your
ransom
i
ca
say
but
bill
curley
been
sent
ashore
on
some
errand
or
other
and
to
be
gone
a
while
too
i
figure
they
could
do
little
but
wait
for
developments
it
was
something
of
a
surprise
to
both
when
bonnet
voice
was
heard
on
the
deck
above
soon
after
ordering
the
capstan
manned
the
anchor
creaked
up
and
to
the
rattle
of
blocks
the
sail
was
hoisted
they
felt
the
sloop
get
under
way
once
more
when
one
of
the
foremast
hands
brought
them
some
biscuit
and
pork
for
supper
he
told
them
it
was
herriot
orders
that
they
be
left
in
irons
for
the
present
at
least
and
added
in
response
to
query
that
they
were
headed
south
under
full
canvas
the
boys
thoughts
were
very
bitter
as
they
tried
to
make
themselves
comfortable
on
the
bare
planking
fortunately
at
their
age
it
requires
more
than
a
hard
bed
to
banish
rest
and
before
the
ship
had
made
three
care
and
bodily
misery
alike
were
forgotten
in
the
heavy
slumber
of
fatigue

legs
clad
as
they
were
in
nothing
more
cumbersome
than
a
pair
of
made
light
work
of
hills
and
ravines
as
he
held
his
way
steadily
up
the
delaware
shore
like
most
of
the
sailors
of
that
day
he
had
gone
barefoot
aboard
ship
since
the
beginning
of
the
warm
weather
and
his
soles
were
so
calloused
that
he
hardly
felt
the
need
of
shoes
at
a
shack
on
a
little
cove
just
before
midday
he
found
several
fishermen
to
whom
he
applied
for
clothing
they
had
pity
on
his
plight
fitted
him
out
with
a
shirt
serviceable
breeches
and
rough
boots
and
gave
him
as
well
as
much
biscuit
and
dried
fish
as
he
wished
to
carry
thus
reinforced
he
continued
to
put
the
leagues
behind
him
till
night
when
he
slept
under
a
convenient
early
next
morning
he
pushed
on
and
came
without
further
adventure
to
the
little
port
of
new
castle
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
job
had
been
in
the
town
before
and
now
went
straight
to
the
red
hawk
tavern
a
small
place
on
the
that
catered
chiefly
to
seafaring
men
the
a
brawny
swede
to
whose
blue
eyes
half
the
seamen
that
plied
along
the
coast
were
familiar
held
out
a
big
hand
to
him
as
he
entered
he
had
known
the
tall
mariner
when
he
had
been
on
the
virginia
bark
before
hornygold
had
captured
it
and
had
had
no
news
of
him
since
job
told
him
his
whole
story
over
a
hot
meal
in
the
back
room
and
it
is
merely
indicative
of
the
public
mind
of
that
day
that
the
big
swede
had
not
the
slightest
compunction
in
sympathizing
with
him
indeed
in
most
dockside
resorts
it
was
a
common
thing
for
pirates
and
honest
seamen
to
fraternize
with
perfect
goodwill
the
innkeeper
offered
him
a
bed
for
the
night
and
next
morning
directed
him
to
the
governor
house
delaware
a
far
smaller
and
less
developed
colony
than
her
neighbors
pennsylvania
and
maryland
had
nevertheless
her
own
government
located
at
new
castle
the
brick
house
of
the
king
appointee
was
on
the
high
street
the
most
imposing
building
in
the
town
excepting
the
two
churches
job
knocked
at
the
door
and
was
admitted
by
a
colored
servant
in
livery
who
gave
him
a
chair
in
the
wide
hall
and
asked
him
to
wait
there
as
the
long
yankee
fidgeted
uncomfortably
on
the
edge
of
his
seat
he
heard
voices
raised
in
a
room
opposite
the
door
of
which
was
closed
some
one
apparently
growing
angry
was
saying
good
gad
man
are
we
to
sit
idle
and
let
these
ruffianly
thieves
make
off
with
our
money
children
wives
one
good
could
teach
the
scamps
such
a
lesson
as
would
scare
half
of
off
the
seas
why
if
i
had
even
a
good
culverin
aboard
the
last
night
have
chased
the
beggars
clear
to
africa
an
need
were
governor
you
see
this
as
we
see
it
there
was
a
reply
in
a
lower
tone
and
a
moment
later
the
door
opened
for
two
gentlemen
to
come
out
one
was
thin
and
pale
and
seemed
a
suave
cool
fellow
job
thought
he
was
elegantly
dressed
in
gray
his
companion
larger
and
more
strongly
built
seemed
to
have
become
very
red
in
the
face
from
suppressed
emotion
his
linen
ruffles
were
awry
and
his
fists
clenched
as
he
emerged
without
looking
at
job
he
jammed
his
cocked
hat
upon
his
head
and
strode
out
the
man
in
gray
turned
to
the
waiting
seaman
and
beckoned
him
into
the
room
just
vacated
job
as
cool
and
as
if
he
were
loading
his
under
fire
told
the
story
of
his
experiences
aboard
the
pirate
sloop
finishing
with
an
account
of
the
attempted
flight
with
jeremy
their
recapture
and
his
escape
the
governor
listened
gravely
starting
once
when
the
mariner
named
captain
bonnet
at
the
end
he
nodded
you
shall
have
the
pardon
as
ruled
by
the
crown
he
said
but
there
is
another
side
to
this
affair
you
say
you
slept
at
the
red
hawk
was
there
no
talk
there
of
a
boy
stolen
from
the
wharves
late
in
the
evening
job
replied
that
he
had
gone
to
bed
early
and
had
breakfasted
and
left
without
hearing
any
gossip
from
what
you
say
went
on
the
governor
i
should
be
ready
to
swear
that
the
captain
thomas
who
proclaimed
himself
by
that
name
in
a
tavern
last
night
and
later
made
off
with
the
son
of
clark
curtis
was
the
same
man
as
your
stede
bonnet
job
hastened
to
relate
the
incident
of
the
buccaneer
crazed
speech
from
the
brig
deck
he
asked
how
the
kidnapper
had
been
described
the
features
tallied
almost
exactly
with
those
of
stede
bonnet
in
addition
the
schooner
as
half
a
dozen
men
would
swear
had
been
painted
black
thus
satisfied
that
bob
curtis
was
aboard
the
the
governor
wrote
a
formal
pardon
stating
that
job
howland
late
a
pirate
having
duly
sworn
his
allegiance
to
his
majesty
the
king
and
repented
of
all
unlawful
acts
committed
by
him
aforetime
was
henceforward
granted
full
release
from
the
penalty
of
his
crimes
and
was
to
be
held
an
honest
man
during
his
good
behavior
then
he
took
the
seaman
with
him
and
passed
quickly
down
to
one
of
the
larger
warehouses
by
the
dockside
standing
in
the
doorway
were
the
gentleman
whom
job
had
seen
that
morning
and
a
large
man
in
sea
boots
easily
recognized
as
a
officer
to
the
rather
cool
greeting
of
the
former
the
governor
returned
a
cheerful
nod
as
they
came
up
look
here
now
curtis
he
said
i
ca
spare
those
cannon
and
that
flat
but
to
show
that
i
mean
well
by
you
i
brought
a
man
whom
you
may
find
of
some
use
tell
him
your
story
howland
the
tale
was
repeated
to
the
intense
interest
of
its
two
new
hearers
by
gad
cried
curtis
slapping
his
thigh
as
the
seaman
finished
that
a
clue
worth
having
we
know
who
the
scoundrel
is
at
least
and
of
course
he
be
sure
to
head
for
carolina
bonnet
could
keep
away
from
that
coast
for
more
than
six
months
if
his
life
depended
upon
it
howland
if
you
care
to
ship
again
i
make
you
aboard
the
here
you
say
you
want
nothing
better
than
to
get
a
crack
at
the
pirate
we
make
what
preparations
we
can
and
get
off
at
once
this
young
friend
of
yours
about
bob
age
he
must
be
well
glad
my
boy
got
company
let
get
to
work
aboard
here
now
job
fell
to
with
a
good
will
helping
the
crew
get
her
ready
for
an
encounter
with
the
pirates
she
carried
only
two
light
serpentine
cannon
of
an
ancient
make
far
below
the
standard
necessary
to
combat
a
schooner
like
the
there
were
no
other
ships
in
the
harbor
carrying
guns
however
and
it
was
over
the
matter
of
procuring
an
armament
that
curtis
had
had
words
with
the
governor
there
were
six
good
culverins
mounted
in
the
fort
below
the
town
the
planter
had
wished
to
borrow
them
to
fit
out
his
vessel
urging
that
it
was
a
matter
of
concern
to
the
whole
colony
to
this
the
governor
replied
that
with
the
port
stripped
of
defences
it
would
be
possible
for
a
pirate
fleet
to
enter
and
plunder
without
difficulty
while
curtis
ship
was
careering
over
the
seven
seas
on
a
chase
naturally
the
personal
element
in
the
affair
blinded
curtis
to
the
truth
in
this
argument
however
with
the
advent
of
job
howland
and
the
news
he
bore
all
differences
were
forgotten
the
planter
and
now
needed
thorough
rather
than
hurried
preparation
he
sent
his
overseer
on
horseback
to
philadelphia
to
arrange
for
the
purchase
of
guns
and
put
all
the
available
carpenters
and
shipwrights
to
work
on
the
strengthening
the
improvised
gun
decks
and
cutting
the
rows
of
ports
the
northeast
gale
that
sprang
up
next
day
put
a
temporary
stop
to
these
activities
and
gave
job
an
opportunity
to
get
himself
some
decent
clothes
and
hobnob
a
while
with
his
friend
the
swede
the
whole
waterfront
was
agog
with
the
news
of
the
kidnapping
and
everywhere
the
tall
new
englander
went
he
was
surrounded
by
a
knot
of
questioning
seamen
several
whose
vessels
lay
at
the
wharves
decided
to
put
off
sailing
until
some
news
should
indicate
that
the
bay
was
clear
when
the
storm
had
blown
itself
out
the
artisans
again
set
to
work
on
the
big
east
indiaman
job
who
had
learned
the
science
of
gunnery
under
good
masters
supervised
the
placing
of
every
porthole
with
reference
to
ease
and
safety
in
firing
as
well
as
to
the
effectiveness
of
a
broadside
he
had
a
section
of
the
deck
forward
of
the
capstan
reinforced
stoutly
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
on
which
he
placed
some
dependence
in
case
of
a
running
fight
it
was
about
six
days
later
in
the
first
week
of
august
when
two
men
came
into
new
castle
from
different
directions
one
on
horseback
the
other
on
foot
the
first
of
these
was
curtis
overseer
returned
from
the
larger
colony
up
the
bay
and
bringing
the
good
news
that
a
score
of
cannon
were
lying
on
the
dock
at
the
foot
of
market
street
in
philadelphia
ready
to
be
shipped
aboard
the
as
soon
as
she
was
put
in
shape
the
other
was
a
man
of
middle
height
lean
and
darkly
sallow
dressed
in
good
sea
clothes
somewhat
worn
he
slipped
through
the
trees
into
a
lane
that
led
toward
the
wharves
coming
unobtrusively
into
the
red
hawk
tavern
at
a
little
after
in
the
evening
he
asked
for
a
pint
of
rum
paid
for
it
and
began
to
talk
politely
to
the
swede
job
was
eating
his
supper
in
one
corner
he
started
when
the
man
entered
but
made
no
exclamation
and
shading
his
face
from
the
light
continued
to
watch
him
narrowly
it
was
his
old
shipmate
bill
curley
the
jamaican
the
pirate
finished
his
rum
and
giving
the
barkeep
a
civil
passed
out
into
the
street
when
he
was
gone
job
rose
and
stepped
to
the
bar
quick
nels
he
whispered
what
did
he
ask
you
he
one
of
bonnet
crew
the
swede
replied
that
he
had
inquired
the
way
to
clarke
curtis
house
job
was
armed
with
a
good
pistol
he
made
sure
it
was
primed
and
then
set
out
up
the
street
keeping
a
careful
lookout
soon
he
detected
the
figure
of
the
jamaican
in
the
gloom
ahead
and
followed
it
keeping
out
of
earshot
the
man
went
straight
up
high
street
to
the
town
residence
of
the
planter
there
were
tall
shrubs
in
the
yard
and
he
waited
behind
one
of
these
apparently
reconnoitering
then
he
stooped
took
off
his
shoes
and
carrying
them
in
one
hand
advanced
and
pinned
a
piece
of
paper
to
the
door
turning
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
gate
and
once
on
the
soft
earth
of
the
road
started
to
run
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come
this
brought
him
in
fifty
yards
face
to
face
with
a
pistol
muzzle
the
butt
of
which
was
held
by
his
old
friend
job
howland
he
stopped
in
his
tracks
and
at
the
big
yankee
command
held
both
arms
above
his
head
job
jammed
the
nose
of
his
weapon
against
curley
breastbone
and
searched
him
without
a
word
having
removed
a
long
dirk
and
a
pistol
from
the
jamaican
waistband
he
ordered
him
to
face
about
and
walk
back
to
the
planter
house
when
they
arrived
there
job
took
down
the
paper
from
the
door
and
knocked
loudly
a
negro
boy
scared
almost
into
fits
at
the
sight
of
the
drawn
pistol
led
the
way
into
his
master
room
curtis
rose
with
an
ejaculation
of
surprise
and
heard
job
brief
account
of
the
events
leading
to
curley
capture
then
he
took
the
paper
and
read
it
alternately
frowning
and
exclaiming
as
he
finished
he
passed
it
to
the
new
englander
it
was
a
letter
neatly
drawn
up
and
written
in
stede
bonnet
even
refined
hand

and
for

welfare
of

ever
your
humble
servant
captain
thomas
ship
well
remarked
job
as
he
finished
we
know
where
they
be
on
september
the
at
all
events
as
for
our
friend
here
we
can
safely
turn
him
over
to
the
constable
i
reckon
here
curley
march
and
he
ushered
the
jamaican
out
as
they
had
entered
the
gaol
was
only
a
few
doors
down
a
cross
street
and
job
had
soon
delivered
his
prisoner
into
capable
hands
then
he
returned
to
curtis
house
the
shipowner
was
pacing
up
and
down
his
library
where
the
paper
lay
on
the
floor
he
looked
up
as
job
entered
and
his
brow
was
wrinkled
deep
with
lines
of
worry
gad
he
exclaimed
this
is
awful
must
we
actually
give
up
trying
to
punish
the
dog
why
he
has
us
at
his
mercy
it
seems
the
money
i
can
raise
i
believe
and
it
not
the
thought
of
losing
it
that
cuts
me
it
letting
that
go
unscathed
and
if
anything
should
slip
in
the
plans
good
god
it
too
terrible
to
think
of
he
dropped
into
an
armchair
his
head
resting
in
his
hands
job
understood
something
of
the
father
anguish
and
refrained
from
any
comment
standing
by
the
broad
oak
mantelpiece
he
mused
over
the
chances
of
the
boy
escape
alive
knowing
bonnet
eccentricities
he
would
have
been
the
last
to
urge
an
armed
attack
in
defiance
of
the
terms
in
the
letter
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
captain
as
he
was
would
be
capable
of
even
more
dastardly
crimes
than
the
one
he
now
threatened
gradually
an
idea
took
form
in
the
brain
it
was
a
bold
one
and
needed
to
be
executed
boldly
if
at
all
when
the
gentleman
raised
his
head
job
turned
and
faced
him
curtis
he
said
there
one
thing
to
be
done
as
far
i
can
see
and
i
believe
it
for
me
to
do
it
i
told
you
about
jeremy
swan
the
boy
we
took
aboard
up
north
along
i
think
most
as
much
o
getting
him
out
o
this
scrape
as
you
do
o
savin
your
lad
now
here
my
scheme
i
know
that
coast
around
cape
fear
like
i
know
the
black
schooner
deck
i
get
down
there
about
the
first
o
september
an
i
reckon
they
be
there
near
the
same
time
i
sneak
up
as
close
as
i
can
in
a
small
boat
then
crawl
acrost
the
bars
till
i
near
their
moorin
an
swim
out
after
dark
so
i
can
look
over
the
lay
o
things
aboard
it
just
possible
that
i
can
get
a
word
to
one
o
the
boys
and
maybe
take
off
without
bein
caught
you
can
be
lyin
to
somewhere
out
o
sight
and
if
we
get
clean
away
we
take
the
around
an
blow
bonnet
out
o
water
that
the
best
i
can
offer
but
if
it
works
it
do
the
job
up
brown
curtis
had
listened
earnestly
amazed
at
the
daring
of
the
suggestion
he
reached
out
a
broad
hand
and
took
job
hairy
fist
in
a
grip
that
expressed
the
depth
of
his
feelings
his
eyes
were
blinking
and
he
could
not
trust
his
voice
but
the
long
yankee
knew
that
the
risk
he
had
offered
to
undertake
was
appreciated
they
talked
far
into
the
night
planning
the
details
of
the
attempt
and
discussing
measures
to
be
employed
should
it
fail
they
still
had
the
best
part
of
a
month
in
which
to
work
it
was
job
suggestion
that
they
should
interest
the
governments
of
north
and
south
carolina
to
help
in
destroying
bonnet
craft
the
pirate
port
of
departure
had
been
charles
town
and
he
was
to
be
fought
in
waters
adjacent
to
both
the
colonies
it
seemed
not
unreasonable
to
hope
that
there
was
aid
to
be
obtained
there
next
day
they
asked
the
governor
sanction
to
this
proposal
and
were
so
far
rewarded
that
in
less
than
another
hours
a
messenger
had
been
dispatched
to
wilmington
and
charles
town
bearing
letters
under
the
colony
seal
chapter
xvi
the
hurried
down
the
chesapeake
for
a
day
and
a
night
before
captain
bonnet
gave
orders
to
free
the
young
prisoners
below
in
the
bilboes
jeremy
and
bob
came
on
deck
stiff
and
weary
from
their
cramped
quarters
and
very
far
from
happy
in
their
minds
rescue
seemed
farther
away
than
ever
and
though
they
had
laid
many
plans
for
an
escape
by
swimming
the
sight
of
the
great
stretch
of
water
off
either
beam
the
shore
was
frequently
a
dozen
miles
away
quenched
their
hopes
in
this
direction
the
crew
seemed
quite
elated
over
something
and
talked
and
joked
incessantly
about
the
prospect
of
action
in
the
near
future
bonnet
was
merrier
than
jeremy
had
ever
seen
him
came
often
on
deck
and
even
mixed
a
little
in
the
conversation
of
the
foremast
hands
on
the
night
that
they
cleared
the
capes
he
served
out
double
noggins
of
rum
to
all
the
men
aboard
there
was
a
good
deal
of
prodigality
in
the
way
it
was
poured
out
and
a
fine
scene
of
carousal
ensued
lasting
until
after
the
watch
changed
at
midnight
it
was
the
first
time
either
of
the
boys
had
heard
the
smashing
chorus
of
fifteen
men
sung
by
the
whole
of
course
the
words
had
often
been
hummed
by
one
or
two
of
the
pirates
but
it
took
the
hot
cheer
of
the
grog
to
open
most
of
their
throats
at
the
final
yo
ho
ho
every
cannikin
crashed
on
the
deal
table
and
the
lantern
heaved
to
and
fro
overhead
as
if
a
gale
were
blowing
outside
there
followed
the
howling
refrain
that
jeremy
had
heard
on
the
beach
of
the
island
a
month
before
an
we
walk
the
bloody
beggars
all
below
all
below
an
we
walk
the
bloody
beggars
all
below
the
sentiment
seemed
too
true
to
be
picturesque
after
what
had
happened
aboard
the
brig
the
buccaneers
with
their
red
drunken
eyes
strained
forward
every
man
and
yelled
like
demons
under
the
swaying
lantern
close
behind
and
above
were
the
smoky
beams
and
planking
black
with
dancing
shadows
yet
wild
and
exciting
as
it
all
was
jeremy
felt
sickened
there
was
no
illusion
no
about
it
for
him
he
had
seen
the
awful
reality
the
murder
and
the
madness
and
he
had
no
admiration
left
for
the
jolly
buccaneer
of
story
on
the
following
morning
and
for
two
days
thereafter
the
schooner
cruised
slowly
along
a
level
sea
under
shortened
sail
a
double
lookout
was
kept
constantly
on
duty
and
as
they
bore
up
to
the
northward
jeremy
saw
that
they
must
be
watching
for
shipping
out
of
the
delaware
bonnet
was
evidently
gambling
on
the
chance
that
bob
friends
had
given
up
the
idea
of
pursuit
then
one
hot
the
two
boys
were
startled
from
their
places
in
the
shade
of
the
by
a
quick
shout
from
the
man
at
the
masthead
they
followed
the
direction
of
his
pointing
arm
with
their
eyes
and
as
the
schooner
heaved
slowly
on
a
gentle
swell
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
low
broad
sail
on
the
port
bow
the
men
were
all
on
deck
ready
to
trim
the
sails
for
greater
speed
but
herriot
after
consulting
with
the
captain
ordered
the
gunners
and
below
to
prepare
ordnance
bob
and
jeremy
were
under
a
tremendous
strain
of
excitement
the
stranger
ship
might
be
one
of
the
new
castle
fleet
which
bob
firmly
believed
to
be
searching
the
seas
to
recapture
him
from
bonnet
should
it
prove
to
be
so
their
lives
were
in
worse
danger
than
ever
for
neither
of
the
boys
doubted
that
the
erratic
captain
would
kill
them
at
once
if
the
fight
went
against
him
however
their
minds
were
soon
set
at
rest
on
this
score
as
the
pirate
drew
up
closer
and
closer
the
details
of
the
other
ship
became
visible
to
those
on
deck
she
also
was
a
trifle
larger
than
the
but
without
the
latter
height
of
mast
her
low
indicated
that
she
was
heavily
cargoed
no
gunports
could
be
seen
along
her
sides
bonnet
now
ordered
an
extra
jib
to
be
broken
out
and
had
the
sloop
brought
around
on
the
port
tack
so
that
her
course
instead
of
running
opposite
to
the
stranger
would
obliquely
cross
it
the
wind
what
little
there
was
came
from
the
west
as
soon
as
the
other
ship
perceived
this
change
in
direction
she
veered
off
her
course
closer
to
the
wind
and
almost
immediately
the
boys
could
see
the
white
flutter
of
some
extra
canvas
being
spread
at
her
bows
as
this
new
piece
filled
out
it
proved
to
be
a
great
balloon
jib
which
increased
her
sail
area
by
nearly
half
her
head
came
off
the
wind
again
and
she
went
bowing
along
over
the
swells
to
the
southward
faster
than
one
would
have
imagined
possible
bonnet
had
figured
on
crossing
her
at
close
range
but
as
she
swept
onward
he
realized
that
he
would
go
by
too
far
astern
to
hail
her
if
he
kept
his
present
direction
herriot
himself
took
the
tiller
as
quickly
as
he
could
without
loss
of
headway
he
eased
the
over
till
she
was
running
nearly
parallel
with
the
fleeing
ship
his
orders
came
quick
and
fast
while
the
men
trimmed
the
main
and
fore
sheets
to
the
last
hair
breadth
of
perfection
it
was
to
be
a
race
and
a
hard
one
for
nearly
half
an
hour
the
sloops
ran
along
almost
neck
and
neck
and
perhaps
half
a
mile
apart
the
pirates
dared
not
risk
pointing
closer
to
the
wind
in
order
to
get
into
cannon
range
they
would
have
lost
so
much
speed
that
it
would
have
developed
into
a
stern
chase
useless
since
they
possessed
only
broadside
batteries
the
best
they
could
do
was
to
hold
their
position
hoping
for
luck
in
the
wind
bonnet
scowled
awhile
at
the
british
jack
that
still
flew
from
the
top
then
went
below
and
brought
up
the
black
pirate
flag
the
buccaneers
now
all
assembled
on
deck
gave
it
a
cheerful
howl
of
greeting
as
it
fluttered
up
to
the
main
truck
now
we
catch
lads
roared
herriot
and
they
answered
him
with
a
second
cheer
for
once
however
the
jolly
roger
seemed
to
bring
bad
fortune
instead
of
good
the
wind
had
hardly
swept
it
easily
to
leeward
once
when
it
fell
back
against
the
shrouds
hardly
stirring
the
pirate
sloop
deck
righted
slowly
and
her
limp
sails
drooped
from
the
gaffs
a
sudden
flaw
in
the
breeze
had
settled
about
her
without
interrupting
her
progress
in
the
least
a
glum
despair
came
over
the
crew
they
lolled
for
the
most
part
silent
or
grumbling
curses
against
the
rails
with
here
and
there
one
trying
to
whistle
up
a
wind
the
other
sloop
rapidly
drew
away
to
the
south
bonnet
had
been
talking
to
herriot
with
quick
gestures
and
pointings
now
he
walked
forward
swiftly
and
the
men
got
to
their
feet
with
a
jump
we
board
the
prize
yet
said
the
captain
short
and
sharp
now
look
alive
every
one
of
you
he
ordered
one
squad
of
men
to
the
hold
for
spars
another
for
rope
a
third
for
a
spare
mainjib
meanwhile
he
set
two
men
to
making
a
sort
of
stirrup
out
of
blocks
of
wood
this
was
fastened
to
the
deck
far
up
in
the
bows
when
the
spars
came
up
he
had
one
of
them
rigged
with
a
tackle
running
to
the
foremast
and
set
its
foot
in
the
wooden
contrivance
just
finished
it
swung
out
forward
like
a
great
jibboom
the
crew
saw
what
was
in
the
captain
mind
and
gave
a
ringing
yell
of
joy
a
score
of
willing
hands
made
fast
the
stays
to
windward
and
others
spread
the
spare
sail
from
the
upper
end
of
the
spar
as
the
last
rope
was
bent
a
strong
draught
of
air
came
over
the
water
the
canvas
shook
then
filled
and
as
the
fresh
breeze
steadied
in
her
sails
the
sloop
heeled
far
to
port
she
moved
faster
and
faster
while
the
white
water
surged
away
under
her
lee
this
was
sailing
worth
while
the
returning
wind
had
come
in
much
stronger
than
before
the
flaw
and
was
now
almost
worthy
of
at
least
one
reef
under
ordinary
conditions
with
her
extra
canvas
the
was
canted
over
perilously
her
lee
scuppers
were
often
awash
and
a
good
deal
of
water
was
coming
into
the
port
gundeck
but
to
the
delight
of
all
on
board
including
the
boys
who
could
hardly
be
blamed
for
relishing
the
excitement
bonnet
refused
to
take
in
an
inch
of
sail
instead
he
ordered
every
available
man
to
the
weather
rail
the
dead
weight
of
thirty
seamen
all
leaning
over
the
side
served
to
keep
the
light
craft
ballasted
for
the
time
being
bob
and
jeremy
clung
to
the
rail
amidships
and
vied
with
each
other
in
stretching
out
over
the
boiling
seas
that
raced
below
the
fleeing
ship
which
had
gained
four
or
five
miles
during
the
lull
was
now
in
plain
view
again
nearly
straight
ahead
her
deep
lading
was
telling
against
her
now
the
handicap
of
sail
area
being
overcome
the
black
pirate
shallow
draft
and
long
lines
gave
her
the
advantage
every
buccaneer
in
the
crew
was
howling
with
excitement
as
the
race
went
on
the
long
main
boom
of
the
skipped
through
the
spray
and
her
mainsail
was
wet
to
the
second
line
of
reef
points
but
herriot
held
her
square
on
the
course
and
bonnet
smiled
grimly
ahead
with
a
look
that
meant
he
would
run
her
under
before
he
would
shorten
sail
hand
over
hand
they
overhauled
their
rival
until
once
more
the
tiny
figures
of
men
were
visible
over
her
rail
a
little
knot
of
them
were
gathered
aft
busy
at
something
bonnet
seized
his
glass
and
scrutinized
them
intently
then
he
yelled
to
herriot
to
ease
the
sloop
off
to
port
they
got
a
gun
astern
there
he
shouted
they
try
our
range
in
a
minute
hardly
had
he
spoken
when
a
spout
of
foam
went
up
from
the
sea
far
to
starboard
followed
almost
instantly
by
the
dull
sound
of
an
explosion
by
the
time
the
gunners
on
the
ship
had
loaded
their
piece
again
the
had
come
over
to
their
port
quarter
and
they
had
to
shift
the
cannon
position
the
shot
went
close
overhead
cutting
a
corner
from
the
black
flag
of
the
pirate
bonnet
swore
beneath
his
breath
then
ordered
the
cannoneers
below
to
their
batteries
they
went
on
the
run
jeremy
and
bob
stayed
above
watching
the
operations
on
the
enemy
deck
the
two
sloops
were
less
than
three
hundred
yards
apart
and
the
had
drawn
nearly
abeam
when
a
third
shot
came
from
her
rival
deck
gun
this
time
it
crashed
into
the
pirate
hull
far
up
by
the
bits
bonnet
was
by
the
fore
hatch
sword
in
hand
as
was
his
custom
during
an
action
looking
coolly
at
the
splintered
bulwark
forward
then
back
at
the
enemy
he
gave
the
sharp
ready
a
starboard
broadside
to
the
waiting
gunners
he
allowed
them
time
to
have
their
matches
alight
then
fire
rang
his
clear
voice
the
deck
leaped
under
the
boys
feet
the
long
thunderous
bellow
of
the
battery
jarred
out
over
the
sea
even
as
they
looked
the
enemy
maingaff
shot
away
at
the
jaws
dangled
loose
from
the
peak
halyards
and
her
broad
sail
crumpled
puffing
out
awkwardly
in
the
breeze
at
the
same
time
a
wide
rent
in
her
side
above
the
waterline
gaped
black
as
she
topped
a
wave
the
gunners
cheer
as
they
saw
their
handiwork
rose
to
a
deafening
yell
taken
up
by
all
hands
when
a
moment
later
the
british
colors
came
fluttering
down
aboard
the
other
ship
herriot
ordered
the
improvised
spinnaker
and
the
taken
in
then
brought
the
buccaneer
sloop
around
and
came
up
beside
the
newly
captured
prize
all
the
pirates
were
behind
the
bulwarks
with
muskets
loaded
prepared
for
any
treachery
that
might
be
intended
however
as
they
ranged
alongside
the
hostile
crew
lined
up
on
their
deck
sullen
but
unarmed
and
the
captain
a
big
man
held
up
a
piece
of
white
cloth
in
token
of
surrender
bonnet
hailed
him
asking
his
name
captain
peter
manewaring
of
the
sloop
philadelphia
for
charles
town
answered
the
coasting
skipper
and
i
am
captain
thomas
in
command
of
the
sloop
james
bonnet
gave
him
in
return
you
will
set
your
men
to
carrying
over
into
my
ship
all
the
powder
you
have
aboard
as
soon
as
we
are
fast
alongside
i
shall
be
pleased
to
entertain
you
in
the
cabin
the
sails
were
run
down
on
both
sloops
and
their
hulls
were
quickly
lashed
together
with
ropes
herriot
superintended
the
operation
of
transferring
a
kegs
of
powder
some
casks
of
wine
and
the
best
food
in
the
coaster
larder
to
the
hold
of
the
black
schooner
the
cargo
of
the
was
a
varied
one
but
not
by
any
means
a
poor
prize
she
carried
some
grain
in
bags
forward
a
great
number
of
bolts
of
cloth
chiefly
woollens
and
other
things
of
divers
sorts
including
some
fine
mahogany
chairs
and
tables
newly
brought
from
england
the
wine
was
merely
incidental
but
proved
very
acceptable
to
the
buccaneers
that
night
with
the
nine
men
of
the
crew
lying
in
irons
on
the
ballast
they
drank
deep
to
their
victory
and
once
more
jeremy
and
bob
fell
asleep
to
the
rough
of
their
bellowings
chapter
xvii
a
stiff
easterly
breeze
whitened
the
gray
seas
next
morning
it
was
cloudy
and
seemed
to
be
getting
ready
for
a
blow
the
pirate
and
her
prize
had
drifted
all
night
bound
together
and
as
day
broke
a
tipsy
lookout
spied
land
to
the
westward
herriot
came
on
deck
hastily
at
the
call
and
himself
went
to
the
rail
to
heave
the
lead
the
soundings
showed
a
bare
four
fathoms
of
water
bonnet
was
summoned
and
the
crew
hardly
recovered
from
their
orgy
staggered
about
the
deck
preparing
to
get
under
way
again
seven
men
under
dunkin
were
told
off
to
man
the
a
dozen
others
were
needed
to
plug
her
before
she
was
really
seaworthy
this
task
being
finally
accomplished
the
ropes
were
taken
off
the
sails
run
up
and
the
two
sloops
closehauled
to
starboard
set
about
beating
off
shore
it
was
a
terrible
day
for
jeremy
and
bob
in
the
crew
there
was
the
regular
fighting
swearing
and
vomiting
that
always
followed
a
night
of
carousal
the
fact
that
they
were
made
the
work
harder
and
the
grumbling
louder
than
ever
the
bow
of
the
was
partly
shot
away
above
the
bits
and
there
was
a
full
day
work
for
every
hand
that
could
be
spared
rigging
canvas
over
the
gap
to
prevent
its
taking
in
water
in
case
of
a
storm
meanwhile
the
was
in
as
filthy
a
state
as
could
well
be
imagined
herriot
thrust
his
head
down
the
hatch
once
during
the
morning
and
as
he
caught
the
sickening
stench
of
the
place
he
called
the
two
boys
who
had
been
up
forward
helping
the
patching
here
young
get
below
and
clean
up
he
ordered
sharply
and
handed
each
lad
a
bucket
and
a
they
filled
the
buckets
and
went
below
reluctantly
at
first
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
stay
under
hatches
for
more
than
five
minutes
at
a
time
so
they
took
turns
in
running
up
for
air
and
a
fresh
supply
of
water
gradually
the
flooding
they
gave
the
place
told
in
its
atmosphere
and
by
noon
they
had
put
it
into
decent
shape
again
hardly
had
jeremy
come
on
deck
weary
and
sickened
with
this
task
when
captain
bonnet
called
to
him
from
the
companion
he
made
his
way
aft
and
entered
the
cabin
bonnet
had
just
resumed
his
place
at
the
broad
table
opposite
him
and
facing
jeremy
was
the
big
slouched
figure
of
captain
manewaring
bring
the
wine
jeremy
said
the
buccaneer
quietly
and
without
turning
he
was
looking
with
steady
eyes
at
his
guest
jeremy
went
back
along
the
passage
to
the
under
the
companion
stairs
and
took
from
it
two
bottles
of
madeira
as
he
was
closing
the
cupboard
door
voice
cut
the
air
like
a
knife
the
two
words
he
spoke
were
not
loud
but
pronounced
with
a
terrible
distinctness
you
lie
was
what
he
said
jeremy
shivered
and
waited
listening
there
was
no
reply
loud
enough
for
him
to
hear
through
the
closed
door
of
the
cabin
after
a
moment
he
tiptoed
back
and
before
turning
the
knob
listened
again
nothing
but
silence
he
opened
the
door
with
a
pounding
heart
and
stepped
into
the
room
the
two
men
sat
motionless
in
their
places
bonnet
held
a
cocked
pistol
in
his
right
hand
its
point
covering
the
other
man
head
on
the
table
before
manewaring
was
a
second
pistol
his
face
was
drawn
and
gray
and
a
fine
sweat
stood
upon
his
forehead
jeremy
shrank
against
the
wall
hardly
breathing
his
two
bottles
clutched
idiotically
one
in
each
hand
the
tense
seconds
ticked
on
by
the
cabin
clock
come
quick
said
the
pirate
with
a
gesture
toward
the
other
pistol
manewaring
hand
appeared
over
the
edge
of
the
table
and
gave
a
trembling
jerk
toward
the
then
it
fell
back
into
his
lap
he
gasped
a
drop
of
sweat
ran
down
his
temple
into
his
gray
beard
again
the
only
sounds
were
the
tick
of
the
cabin
clock
the
wash
of
the
seas
outside
and
the
hoarse
breathing
of
the
cornered
man
at
length
he
moved
with
a
sort
of
shudder
whispered
the
name
of
his
maker
and
seized
the
butt
of
the
pistol
desperately
bonnet
had
raised
his
weapon
pointing
to
the
ceiling
i
shall
count
three
then
fire
said
he
in
the
same
even
voice
one
but
before
he
spoke
again
his
opponent
had
jerked
his
muzzle
down
and
fired
bonnet
must
have
seen
the
flash
of
the
intention
in
his
eyes
for
he
threw
himself
to
the
left
at
that
instant
and
the
shot
went
crashing
through
a
panel
of
the
door
with
the
deliberate
sureness
of
fate
the
pirate
took
aim
at
his
adversary
who
whimpered
and
grovelled
behind
the
table
then
he
shot
him
jeremy
knees
went
limp
but
he
saved
himself
from
falling
and
managed
to
set
the
bottles
on
the
table
behind
him
as
he
staggered
out
stede
bonnet
poured
himself
a
glass
of
wine
and
drank
it
with
a
steady
hand
the
boy
met
a
crowd
of
men
at
the
head
of
the
companion
but
was
too
shaken
to
tell
them
what
had
happened
herriot
going
below
heard
the
details
of
the
duel
from
the
captain
own
lips
under
the
orders
the
body
of
the
dead
man
was
carried
out
on
deck
sewed
into
a
piece
of
sailcloth
and
heaved
over
the
rail
without
more
ado
jeremy
made
his
way
to
his
bunk
and
told
bob
the
story
between
chattering
teeth
there
was
silence
on
the
ship
that
afternoon
bonnet
action
had
sobered
his
rough
company
to
the
point
where
they
ceased
quarreling
and
talked
in
undertones
gathering
in
little
knots
about
the
slanted
deck
when
not
at
work
the
two
boys
were
glad
enough
to
be
out
of
the
way
jeremy
tired
and
discouraged
sat
on
the
bunk
edge
his
shoulders
hunched
and
his
eyes
on
the
floor
his
young
companion
who
had
more
cause
for
hope
watched
him
with
sympathetic
eyes
he
could
see
that
the
new
england
boy
was
too
dejected
even
to
try
to
plan
their
escape
the
usual
occupation
of
their
hours
together
finally
he
reached
over
a
bit
shyly
and
gave
him
a
friendly
pat
on
the
back
brace
up
jeremy
he
said
you
clean
tuckered
out
but
a
rest
and
a
nap
help
here
cover
yourself
up
and
i
do
your
work
tonight
maybe
i
have
a
scheme
thought
up
to
tell
you
in
the
morning
jeremy
cared
little
whether
he
slept
or
woke
for
the
events
of
the
past
days
coupled
with
the
disappointment
of
not
being
set
ashore
as
he
had
hoped
had
brought
even
his
determined
courage
to
a
low
ebb
he
was
on
the
verge
of
a
fever
and
bob
prescription
of
rest
and
sleep
was
what
he
most
needed
made
snug
at
the
back
side
of
the
berth
where
little
or
no
light
came
he
fell
into
a
fitful
slumber
bob
took
a
last
look
to
see
that
his
friend
was
comfortable
and
went
on
deck
pharaoh
daggs
had
taken
a
great
deal
of
liquor
the
night
before
as
was
his
wont
when
grog
was
being
passed
the
rum
he
consumed
seemed
to
affect
him
very
little
no
one
ever
heard
him
sing
though
his
cruel
face
with
its
awful
livid
scar
would
lean
forward
and
sway
to
and
fro
with
the
rhythm
of
the
choruses
he
could
walk
a
reeling
deck
or
climb
a
slack
shroud
as
well
to
all
appearances
when
he
had
taken
a
gallon
as
most
men
when
they
were
sober
from
newfoundland
to
trinidad
he
was
known
among
the
pirates
as
a
man
whose
head
would
stand
drink
like
a
bucket
this
reputation
was
made
possible
by
the
fact
that
he
was
no
talker
at
any
time
and
when
in
liquor
clamped
his
jaws
like
a
sprung
trap
whatever
effect
the
alcohol
may
have
had
upon
his
mind
was
not
apparent
because
no
thoughts
passed
his
lips
the
rum
did
go
to
his
head
however
the
instinctive
effort
of
will
that
kept
his
legs
steady
and
his
mouth
shut
had
no
root
in
thought
behind
the
veil
of
those
light
eyes
the
brain
of
pharaoh
daggs
drunk
was
like
a
seething
pit
one
black
fuddle
of
ugliness
to
compensate
for
the
apparent
lack
of
effect
of
liquor
upon
him
the
inward
disturbance
usually
lasted
long
after
the
more
tipsy
seamen
had
slept
around
to
clear
heads
today
he
lolled
with
his
sneering
face
toward
the
weather
beam
a
figure
upon
whose
privacy
no
one
would
care
to
trespass
the
sound
of
the
shots
and
the
tale
of
the
duel
had
neither
one
awakened
in
him
any
apparent
interest
through
the
long
afternoon
till
nearly
five
he
slouched
by
the
then
with
a
leisurely
stretch
he
walked
to
the
hatch
and
peered
down
it
wheeling
about
he
scanned
the
deck
craftily
looking
at
all
the
men
in
turn
before
he
descended
the
ladder
in
the
below
he
paused
again
and
seemed
to
send
his
piercing
glance
into
every
bunk
from
the
forward
to
the
after
bulkhead
finally
satisfied
that
no
one
else
was
in
the
he
went
to
his
own
sleeping
place
on
the
port
side
and
kneeling
beside
the
berth
hauled
a
heavy
from
beneath
it
jeremy
light
sleep
was
broken
by
a
scraping
sound
close
by
he
opened
his
eyes
without
moving
and
from
where
he
lay
could
see
a
man
busy
at
something
opposite
him
as
the
figure
turned
and
straightened
he
knew
it
for
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
the
boy
was
instantly
on
the
alert
for
he
had
every
reason
to
distrust
daggs
without
making
a
sound
he
worked
nearer
to
the
edge
of
the
bunk
and
pulled
the
cover
up
to
hide
all
but
his
eyes
the
pirate
hauled
his
chest
out
farther
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
where
more
light
fell
illustration
then
he
knelt
before
it
and
unlocked
it
with
a
key
which
he
took
from
about
his
neck
jeremy
almost
expected
to
see
a
heap
of
gold
coin
as
the
lid
was
raised
he
was
disappointed
a
garment
of
dark
cloth
probably
a
cloak
and
some
dirty
linen
were
all
that
came
to
view
the
buccaneer
lifted
out
a
number
of
articles
of
seaman
gear
and
laid
them
beside
him
after
them
came
a
leather
pouch
quite
heavy
jeremy
thought
the
man
raised
it
carefully
and
weighed
it
in
his
hand
it
must
have
been
his
portion
of
the
spoils
taken
on
the
voyage
however
this
was
not
what
he
was
after
it
seemed
for
a
moment
later
it
was
laid
on
the
floor
beside
the
other
things
next
he
removed
two
pistols
and
a
second
pouch
of
the
sort
used
for
powder
and
shot
there
was
a
long
interval
as
he
rummaged
in
the
bottom
of
the
box
under
other
contents
which
jeremy
could
not
see
at
last
the
pirate
stood
up
holding
a
rolled
paper
tied
with
string
another
long
moment
he
peered
about
him
and
listened
when
he
had
reassured
himself
he
untied
the
string
and
opened
the
paper
a
square
document
perhaps
a
foot
each
way
it
was
discolored
and
worn
at
the
edges
apparently
quite
old
what
was
inscribed
on
it
jeremy
could
not
see
stare
as
he
might
daggs
examined
it
a
moment
then
knelt
preoccupied
and
spread
it
upon
the
floor
with
one
finger
he
traced
a
line
along
it
zigzagging
from
one
side
diagonally
to
the
foot
his
lips
moving
silently
meanwhile
then
his
other
hand
hovered
above
the
document
for
a
time
before
he
planted
his
thumb
squarely
upon
a
spot
near
the
top
jeremy
thoughts
kept
time
with
his
racing
heart
he
watched
every
motion
of
the
buccaneer
with
a
fierce
intentness
that
missed
no
detail
daggs
had
been
quiet
for
a
full
two
minutes
a
crafty
gloating
smile
playing
over
his
thin
lips
now
once
more
he
touched
a
place
upon
the
sheet
before
him
right
there
she
be
he
muttered
then
after
slowly
rolling
up
the
paper
he
replaced
it
and
locked
the
box
the
eyes
of
the
boy
in
the
bunk
gleamed
excitedly
for
he
was
sure
now
of
the
nature
of
the
document
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
it
was
a
chart
solomon
brig
treasure
he
whispered
to
himself
as
the
tall
figure
of
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
clambered
upward
through
the
hatch
chapter
xviii
jeremy
realized
that
his
life
would
be
in
danger
if
daggs
saw
him
coming
on
deck
after
what
had
just
happened
he
lay
still
therefore
in
spite
of
his
desire
to
tell
bob
what
he
had
seen
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
his
imagination
painted
pictures
of
ironbound
chests
in
the
yellow
beach
sand
of
some
lonely
island
far
down
in
the
tropics
gloomy
caves
beneath
mysteriously
waving
palm
trees
caves
whose
black
depths
shot
forth
a
ruddy
gleam
of
gold
coin
when
a
chance
ray
of
light
came
through
the
shade
of
shattered
hulks
that
lay
ten
fathoms
down
in
the
clear
green
water
of
some
still
lagoon
where
pure
white
coral
beds
gave
back
the
sleeping
sunshine
and
fishes
of
all
bright
colors
he
had
ever
seen
or
dreamed
about
swam
through
the
ancient
ports
to
stare
at
heaps
of
glistening
gems
at
last
he
must
have
slept
for
bob
voice
in
his
ear
brought
him
back
to
the
dingy
of
the
with
a
start
the
lantern
was
lit
and
most
of
the
port
watch
were
snoring
heavily
in
their
bunks
after
a
hard
day
work
bob
took
off
his
shoes
and
trousers
and
climbed
into
the
narrow
berth
beside
his
friend
who
was
now
wide
awake
listen
bob
whispered
the
new
england
boy
as
soon
as
they
were
settled
do
you
remember
the
things
daggs
has
said
off
and
on
about
old
sol
brig
how
there
was
always
a
lot
of
gold
that
the
men
before
the
mast
never
saw
and
how
he
must
have
saved
it
till
he
was
the
richest
of
all
the
pirates
well
who
would
know
what
became
of
that
money
if
anybody
did
daggs
of
course
the
only
man
that
left
of
brig
crew
i
think
daggs
knows
and
what
more
i
believe
i
saw
the
very
chart
that
shows
where
it
is
he
went
on
to
tell
all
he
had
seen
that
afternoon
bob
was
as
excited
as
he
when
he
had
finished
we
must
try
to
get
hold
of
that
map
or
else
get
a
sight
of
it
he
exclaimed
jeremy
was
doubtful
of
the
possibility
of
this
you
see
he
said
the
key
is
on
a
string
his
neck
the
only
way
would
be
to
break
the
chest
open
it
big
and
heavy
and
we
should
raise
the
whole
ship
with
the
racket
then
besides
i
do
like
to
steal
the
thing
even
though
he
is
a
pirate
bob
also
felt
that
it
would
hardly
be
honest
to
break
into
a
man
box
no
matter
what
his
character
might
be
if
we
should
just
happen
to
see
the
chart
though
he
finally
explained
why
we
have
just
as
much
right
to
hunt
for
the
treasure
as
he
has
or
any
one
else
jeremy
agreed
to
this
solution
of
a
knotty
problem
of
honor
and
both
boys
decided
that
for
the
present
they
had
no
course
in
the
matter
but
to
wait
for
some
accident
to
put
the
paper
in
their
way
however
not
to
let
any
opportunities
slip
they
resolved
to
watch
pharaoh
daggs
constantly
while
he
was
awake
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
second
glimpse
of
the
treasured
document
jeremy
had
regained
both
strength
and
spirits
when
he
tumbled
out
next
morning
the
pall
of
uneasiness
which
had
hung
over
the
ship
all
the
day
before
had
lifted
and
the
men
sobered
once
more
went
about
their
business
as
usual
the
boys
set
themselves
to
the
task
of
watching
with
much
zeal
it
was
not
so
difficult
as
might
be
expected
they
had
always
been
aware
of
the
presence
of
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
whenever
he
was
on
deck
his
sinister
eye
was
too
unpleasant
to
meet
without
a
shiver
likewise
they
felt
an
instinctive
relief
when
he
went
out
of
sight
for
this
reason
it
was
no
great
matter
for
either
lad
that
happened
to
be
present
to
note
the
fact
of
the
pirate
going
below
whenever
he
left
the
deck
for
anything
he
was
shadowed
by
bob
or
jeremy
as
the
case
might
be
for
nearly
three
days
the
mysterious
chest
remained
untouched
of
that
the
boys
were
sure
the
threatened
storm
that
had
roughened
the
sea
on
the
day
when
captain
manewaring
met
his
sudden
end
seemed
to
have
spent
itself
in
racing
clouds
and
gusts
of
wind
fair
weather
followed
and
for
hours
the
and
her
prize
stood
off
the
coast
heading
up
to
the
northeastward
with
the
wind
on
the
port
quarter
bonnet
had
remained
below
haggard
and
brooding
suffering
from
one
of
the
spells
of
reaction
that
commonly
followed
his
misdeeds
by
night
of
the
second
day
he
cast
off
his
gloom
and
came
on
deck
the
old
reckless
light
in
his
eye
here
herriot
he
called
as
he
appeared
we
got
a
rich
prize
in
our
fist
and
a
richer
one
coming
let
be
gay
dogs
all
tonight
give
the
hands
extra
grog
and
i
see
you
in
the
cabin
over
a
square
bottle
when
the
watch
is
changed
before
the
mast
the
news
was
hailed
with
delighted
cheering
a
keg
of
rum
was
rolled
out
of
the
hold
and
set
on
the
table
hardly
had
darkness
settled
before
half
the
men
aboard
were
drunk
and
the
cannikins
came
back
to
the
spigot
in
an
unending
procession
there
was
too
much
liquor
available
for
the
usual
choruses
to
be
sung
most
of
the
pirates
swilled
it
like
pigs
and
stopped
for
nothing
till
they
could
move
no
longer
but
lay
helpless
where
they
happened
to
fall
only
a
bare
three
men
stayed
sober
enough
to
sail
the
ship
jeremy
thanked
his
stars
for
fair
weather
when
he
thought
of
the
case
they
might
have
been
in
had
the
orgy
occurred
in
a
night
of
storm
next
day
a
few
of
the
crew
woke
at
breakfast
time
the
rest
snored
out
their
drunken
sleep
below
daggs
came
on
deck
as
usual
to
the
outward
eye
quite
his
careless
ugly
self
his
two
young
enemies
watched
him
closely
for
they
suspected
that
the
drink
he
had
taken
had
helped
to
jeremy
previous
discovery
as
the
hours
went
by
one
after
another
of
the
buccaneers
woke
and
dragged
himself
on
deck
to
growl
the
discomfort
out
of
him
by
jeremy
going
below
found
all
the
bunks
empty
he
slipped
behind
a
chest
far
up
in
the
dark
bow
angle
and
waited
for
a
signal
from
bob
the
boys
had
seen
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
watching
the
decks
uneasily
for
hours
and
suspected
that
he
meant
to
go
below
as
soon
as
the
was
empty
jeremy
must
have
been
in
his
hiding
place
close
to
half
an
hour
before
he
heard
bob
sharply
whistled
tune
close
outside
in
the
gun
deck
he
ducked
lower
behind
his
box
and
presently
heard
steps
descending
the
ladder
a
guarded
observation
taken
from
a
dark
corner
close
to
the
floor
disclosed
the
slouching
form
of
daggs
standing
by
the
table
the
buccaneer
took
a
long
time
for
his
cautious
survey
of
the
standing
perfectly
still
he
turned
his
body
from
the
hips
and
gave
the
place
a
silent
scrutiny
before
he
set
to
work
he
proceeded
just
as
he
had
done
before
and
quickly
had
the
chest
open
and
its
contents
spread
upon
the
planking
he
had
just
unrolled
the
chart
when
a
shout
from
the
hatch
made
him
leap
to
his
feet
sail
ho
was
being
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
above
and
already
there
were
men
on
the
ladder
in
a
fever
of
haste
daggs
the
chest
under
his
bunk
and
shoved
the
loose
clothes
and
small
arms
after
it
the
paper
he
still
held
in
his
hand
after
a
second
of
indecision
while
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
descending
crowd
of
seamen
he
thrust
it
in
on
top
of
the
box
and
stood
erect
flushed
and
swaying
the
hands
were
preoccupied
and
none
seemed
to
notice
his
act
there
was
a
general
scurrying
of
sailors
to
get
out
their
cutlasses
and
pistols
and
in
the
confusion
jeremy
found
an
easy
opportunity
to
crawl
out
of
the
hiding
place
and
busy
himself
like
the
rest
going
on
deck
a
minute
later
he
found
bob
and
whispered
a
brief
account
of
what
he
had
seen
for
the
present
there
was
much
to
be
done
on
deck
they
ran
hither
and
thither
at
herriot
commands
giving
a
hand
at
a
rope
or
fetching
something
mislaid
in
the
cabin
the
was
under
all
her
canvas
and
in
hot
pursuit
of
a
large
sloop
visible
some
three
miles
to
leeward
the
fleeing
ship
was
driving
straight
to
sea
before
the
strong
west
breeze
her
sails
spread
on
both
sides
like
the
broad
stubby
wings
of
a
white
owl
bonnet
had
his
jury
spar
swung
to
starboard
from
the
foremast
foot
and
bent
the
big
jib
to
balance
his
main
and
foresail
bowing
her
head
deep
into
every
trough
as
the
waves
swept
by
the
black
sloop
ran
after
her
prey
at
dizzy
speed
the
crew
gathered
along
the
wet
bows
silent
intent
on
the
game
in
hand
they
were
drawing
up
perceptibly
from
moment
to
moment
at
last
they
were
within
half
a
mile
five
hundred
yards
close
astern
aboard
the
enemy
they
could
see
a
small
knot
of
men
huddled
aft
working
desperately
at
the
breach
of
a
bonnet
ordered
herriot
to
stand
off
to
starboard
for
a
broadside
but
as
the
swerved
outward
a
flare
of
fire
and
a
loud
report
went
up
from
her
opponent
after
part
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
her
cannon
had
been
discharged
at
the
pirate
but
as
they
waited
for
the
splash
of
the
shot
a
thick
smoke
grew
in
a
cloud
over
the
enemy
deck
the
gun
or
a
keg
of
powder
had
exploded
as
soon
as
the
buccaneers
perceived
it
they
bellowed
hoarse
hurrahs
and
prepared
to
board
the
gunners
swarmed
up
from
the
port
gun
deck
at
the
order
and
all
lined
up
along
the
rail
howling
defiance
at
the
merchantman
jeremy
saw
that
all
were
on
deck
and
touched
bob
arm
they
made
their
way
quietly
below
and
the
new
englander
went
to
berth
from
beneath
it
protruded
the
corner
of
the
piece
of
paper
both
boys
knelt
eagerly
over
it
as
jeremy
pulled
it
into
the
light
it
was
as
they
had
expected
a
chart
the
drawing
was
crudely
done
in
ink
applied
it
seemed
with
a
stick
or
possibly
with
a
very
badly
fashioned
there
was
very
little
writing
upon
it
and
this
of
the
raggedest
sort
to
their
intense
disappointment
it
bore
no
name
to
tell
where
in
the
seven
seas
it
might
be
that
the
chart
was
of
some
coast
was
certain
a
deep
irregular
bay
occupied
the
central
part
of
the
sheet
two
long
promontories
jutting
from
east
and
west
nearly
closed
the
seaward
or
southern
end
the
single
word
watter
was
written
beside
a
dot
high
up
on
the
paper
and
a
little
northeast
of
the
bay
an
anchor
roughly
drawn
near
the
northern
shore
and
a
small
cross
between
two
parallel
lines
a
short
distance
inland
completed
the
information
given
except
for
a
crossed
arrow
and
letters
indicating
the
cardinal
points
of
the
compass
illustration
it
required
no
great
time
for
the
two
lads
to
examine
every
line
and
mark
they
looked
up
and
faced
each
other
disappointed
jeremy
voiced
the
thought
which
both
had
how
are
we
to
know
where
the
thing
is
he
asked
bob
shook
his
head
and
looked
glum
then
he
seized
the
paper
feverishly
and
turned
it
over
its
soiled
yellow
back
gave
no
clue
not
even
the
latitude
and
longitude
were
printed
well
said
jeremy
finally
one
thing
we
can
do
and
that
remember
exactly
how
it
looks
he
measured
the
length
of
the
bay
with
the
middle
joint
of
his
forefinger
three
four
and
a
bit
over
he
counted
anchorage
in
that
round
cove
to
the
northwest
then
measuring
again
and
the
cross
is
two
northwest
of
the
anchorage
what
those
lines
each
side
of
it
are
i
do
know
but
i
remember
them
and
that
dot
marked
watter
is
one
and
a
half
northeast
of
the
cove
there
i
guess
we
got
it
all
by
heart
now
he
had
just
finished
speaking
and
both
of
them
were
still
looking
intently
at
the
map
when
a
fresh
outburst
of
cheers
and
the
beginning
of
a
sharp
musketry
fire
were
heard
above
jeremy
replaced
the
paper
where
he
had
found
it
and
they
hurried
up
to
look
out
of
the
hatchway
the
two
ships
were
now
only
half
a
cable
length
apart
running
side
by
side
few
shots
were
being
returned
by
the
merchantman
and
all
her
crew
were
keeping
out
of
sight
behind
the
solid
rail
all
hands
to
board
her
bonnet
sang
out
and
answering
her
tiller
the
swung
over
till
the
two
sloops
sides
met
with
a
jar
they
were
fast
in
an
instant
and
a
score
of
whooping
buccaneers
swept
over
the
rail
from
a
place
of
vantage
the
boys
watched
the
short
bloody
conflict
that
followed
it
seemed
that
several
of
the
enemy
crew
few
as
they
were
at
the
beginning
had
been
killed
by
the
explosion
of
the
gun
only
a
rose
to
meet
the
pirate
onslaught
not
one
asked
for
mercy
even
after
herriot
had
shot
down
the
captain
and
the
tide
of
rushed
at
and
over
the
little
handful
of
defenders
in
an
overwhelming
flood
there
was
no
need
of
the
plank
this
time
every
man
fell
fighting
and
died
sword
in
hand
to
the
two
young
prisoners
already
sickened
with
the
sight
of
blood
this
wholesale
murder
of
a
band
of
gallant
seamen
came
as
a
revolting
climax
they
stared
at
each
other
as
they
thought
of
the
fate
that
threatened
them
and
all
honest
men
who
fell
into
such
ruthless
hands
it
was
bob
first
sight
of
a
and
as
the
last
merchant
sailor
went
down
under
the
howling
pack
he
fainted
and
tumbled
into
jeremy
arms
when
he
came
to
his
senses
again
the
yankee
boy
had
propped
him
up
behind
the
companion
and
was
rubbing
him
vigorously
i
know
how
you
feel
he
said
in
answer
to
bob
stammered
apology
it
all
right
and
you
no
call
to
be
ashamed
i
came
near
it
myself
the
delaware
lad
who
had
been
almost
as
distressed
at
being
guilty
of
swooning
as
at
the
pillage
of
the
merchant
sloop
felt
a
vast
relief
when
he
heard
words
and
quickly
got
upon
his
feet
once
more
the
pirates
had
cleared
the
enemy
deck
of
bodies
and
blood
and
now
were
taking
an
inventory
of
the
sloop
cargo
if
the
shouts
that
came
from
her
hold
meant
anything
she
was
a
little
larger
than
the
in
length
and
beam
but
had
carried
no
armament
other
than
the
now
damaged
the
white
letters
at
her
stern
declared
her
the
of
new
castle
from
what
captain
bonnet
said
to
his
as
they
returned
over
the
rail
jeremy
gathered
that
she
had
been
in
light
cargo
and
was
not
as
rich
a
prize
as
the
the
latter
ship
had
now
come
up
and
was
standing
off
and
on
waiting
for
orders
bonnet
had
lost
two
men
killed
and
several
hurt
in
the
fight
so
that
the
crew
of
the
without
the
prize
crew
on
board
the
now
numbered
scarce
a
dozen
men
the
question
of
manning
the
newly
captured
sloop
was
finally
settled
by
transferring
to
her
george
dunkin
and
his
seven
seamen
bonnet
freed
the
men
of
the
who
had
been
in
chains
and
set
them
to
work
their
own
ship
under
command
of
herriot
and
another
pirate
he
undertook
to
sail
the
himself
for
by
this
time
he
was
really
an
able
skipper
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
taken
to
the
sea
so
late
in
life
as
the
crew
of
the
lined
up
before
going
aboard
the
notorious
buccaneer
faced
them
with
a
cold
glitter
in
his
eyes
for
a
while
he
kept
them
wriggling
under
his
piercing
scrutiny
then
he
spoke
his
voice
even
and
dangerous
you
will
be
under
herriot
orders
i
think
you
are
wise
enough
not
to
try
to
mutiny
with
him
but
if
you
should
undertake
it
remember
that
no
sooner
does
your
sloop
draw
away
to
over
one
mile
distance
than
i
will
come
after
you
and
blow
you
out
of
water
without
parley
there
are
just
enough
sails
left
aboard
your
ship
to
keep
headway
in
a
light
breeze
over
with
you
now
as
darkness
deepened
the
three
sloops
set
out
westward
under
shortened
canvas
keeping
so
close
that
the
steersmen
hailed
each
other
frequently
through
the
night
bob
and
jeremy
went
to
their
bunks
gloomy
and
subdued
but
jeremy
sorrows
were
lightened
by
the
feeling
that
sometime
somewhere
he
would
find
a
use
for
the
chart
the
outline
of
which
he
had
firmly
fixed
in
his
memory
that
afternoon
and
wondering
how
he
fell
asleep
chapter
xix
the
fair
weather
held
and
for
several
days
the
little
fleet
cruised
west
by
south
then
southerly
when
they
had
picked
up
the
virginia
capes
the
pirate
crew
in
spite
of
their
impatience
to
divide
the
cumbersome
booty
they
had
helped
to
win
kept
in
a
fairly
good
temper
hopes
were
high
and
quarrels
were
quickly
put
aside
with
a
take
it
easy
boys
wait
till
the
sharin
over
bob
and
jeremy
got
off
with
a
minimum
of
hard
words
and
might
have
considered
their
lot
almost
agreeable
but
for
one
incident
the
whippings
which
were
a
regular
part
of
boys
lives
aboard
ship
in
those
days
had
always
been
administered
by
george
dunkin
as
it
was
not
only
his
right
but
his
duty
to
lay
in
with
a
end
occasionally
he
was
one
of
the
fairest
men
in
bonnet
company
and
jeremy
had
never
felt
any
great
injustice
in
the
treatment
dunkin
had
accorded
him
since
his
lieutenancy
aboard
the
however
the
had
necessarily
ceased
to
be
the
executive
of
punishment
and
when
monday
recognized
on
all
the
seas
as
whipping
day
came
around
there
was
a
very
secret
hope
in
jeremy
heart
that
the
office
would
be
forgotten
as
for
bob
he
had
so
far
escaped
the
lash
it
being
understood
that
he
was
not
an
ordinary
ship
boy
as
the
day
wore
on
the
yankee
lad
remained
as
inconspicuous
as
possible
and
began
to
think
that
he
was
safe
about
however
a
gang
of
buccaneers
working
at
the
rent
in
the
bows
which
still
gave
trouble
shouted
for
a
bucket
of
drinking
water
bob
had
been
snoozing
in
the
shade
of
the
sail
and
when
he
was
roused
at
last
took
his
own
time
in
carrying
out
the
order
when
he
appeared
finally
there
was
a
good
deal
of
swearing
in
the
air
daggs
reached
out
and
jerked
the
boy
into
the
center
of
the
group
his
light
eyes
agleam
under
scowling
brows
see
here
you
little
runt
he
hissed
do
think
because
the
savin
you
to
kill
later
that
you
the
bloomin
mate
of
this
ship
come
here
to
the
capstan
now
before
bob
was
aware
of
what
they
meant
to
do
the
angry
sailors
had
slung
him
over
a
capstan
bar
and
tied
his
hands
and
feet
to
a
ring
in
the
deck
after
the
clothes
had
been
pulled
off
his
back
there
was
an
interval
while
the
pirates
quarrelled
over
who
should
do
the
whipping
daggs
demanded
the
right
and
finally
prevailed
by
threatening
the
instant
disemboweling
of
his
rivals
bob
was
trembling
and
white
not
from
fear
but
because
of
the
indignity
of
the
punishment
the
scarred
executioner
spat
on
his
hands
took
the
heavy
rope
and
squared
his
feet
shiver
away
you
cowardly
pup
said
he
grinning
at
one
side
of
his
twisted
mouth
then
with
a
vicious
whirl
of
his
arm
he
brought
the
hard
hemp
down
on
the
boy
naked
shoulders
once
twice
three
times
the
lad
lost
count
at
last
he
nearly
lost
consciousness
under
the
torturing
fire
of
the
blows
when
the
buccaneer
ceased
for
lack
of
breath
his
victim
hung
limp
and
twitching
over
the
wooden
bar
long
welts
that
were
beginning
to
drip
red
crossed
and
recrossed
his
back
now
where
that
other
whelp
panted
daggs
somebody
went
below
and
dragged
jeremy
to
light
the
boy
was
brought
up
to
the
crowd
at
the
capstan
he
took
one
look
at
bob
pitiful
set
stare
and
the
red
drops
on
the
deck
then
turned
blazing
to
face
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
you
great
coward
he
cried
the
man
was
staggered
for
an
instant
then
his
rage
boiled
up
and
the
tanned
skin
of
his
neck
turned
the
color
of
old
mahogany
i
kill
the
boy
he
whispered
hoarsely
and
drew
back
his
heavy
rope
for
a
swing
at
jeremy
head
daggs
a
voice
cut
the
air
from
close
by
his
side
daggs
who
made
you
of
this
sloop
the
man
whirled
and
nearly
fell
over
for
stede
bonnet
was
at
his
elbow
one
more
thing
of
this
kind
aboard
and
i
maroon
you
said
the
captain
sharply
and
added
gray
put
this
man
in
irons
and
see
that
he
gets
only
bread
and
water
for
five
days
then
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
back
to
the
cabin
so
once
more
jeremy
life
was
saved
by
the
captain
whim
he
half
carried
half
supported
his
chum
to
their
bunk
and
after
rubbing
his
back
with
grease
begged
from
the
galley
nursed
him
the
rest
of
the
day
by
the
following
afternoon
the
delaware
lad
had
recovered
his
spirits
and
although
he
was
still
too
sore
and
stiff
to
go
on
deck
had
no
trouble
in
eating
the
food
jeremy
brought
him
the
absence
of
daggs
made
life
assume
a
happier
outlook
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
boy
was
as
right
as
ever
august
was
nearly
past
to
the
boys
who
knew
little
of
the
geography
of
the
coast
and
nothing
of
bonnet
plans
it
was
something
of
a
surprise
when
the
man
at
the
tiller
of
the
which
was
in
the
lead
swung
her
head
over
to
landward
one
morning
low
shores
with
a
white
line
of
sand
beneath
the
vivid
dark
green
of
trees
ran
along
the
western
horizon
as
the
sloop
ran
in
the
boys
expected
to
see
the
broad
opening
of
some
bay
but
there
was
still
no
visible
variation
of
the
coast
line
no
town
was
to
be
seen
nor
even
a
single
hut
when
they
were
close
in
the
trees
were
bob
said
though
jeremy
had
never
seen
one
to
know
it
before
the
and
her
consorts
held
a
slow
course
along
the
shore
for
several
hours
the
strip
of
sand
was
gradually
widening
and
in
places
stretched
inland
for
a
mile
in
dunes
and
hillocks
traversed
by
little
tidewater
creeks
at
last
there
showed
a
narrow
inlet
between
two
dunes
and
bonnet
who
had
now
taken
the
helm
headed
the
sloop
cautiously
for
this
opening
one
of
the
men
constantly
heaved
the
lead
and
cried
the
soundings
as
the
ship
progressed
the
pirate
chief
kept
to
the
left
of
the
channel
and
finally
passed
through
into
a
wide
lagoon
with
a
scant
fathom
to
spare
at
the
shallowest
place
the
entered
without
difficulty
but
the
grounded
midway
in
and
had
to
wait
several
hours
for
the
tide
to
float
her
listening
to
the
talk
of
the
crew
bob
heard
them
say
they
had
come
into
the
mouth
of
the
cape
fear
river
in
carolina
from
what
he
knew
of
the
nearby
coast
he
believed
that
it
was
a
very
wild
region
almost
unsettled
and
that
there
would
be
slight
chance
of
getting
to
safety
even
if
they
were
able
to
effect
an
escape
this
fear
seemed
justified
later
in
the
day
when
bonnet
said
to
one
of
his
men
that
there
was
no
need
of
shackling
the
boys
as
had
been
done
in
the
chesapeake
turning
so
that
they
could
hear
he
added
too
many
indians
in
these
woods
for
the
lads
to
try
to
leave
the
ship
jeremy
who
had
seen
enough
of
both
pirates
and
indians
to
last
him
a
lifetime
remarked
to
his
friend
that
personally
he
would
risk
his
neck
with
one
as
soon
as
the
other
but
bob
had
heard
terrible
stories
of
the
red
men
cruelty
and
did
not
agree
with
him
we
best
stay
aboard
and
wait
for
a
better
chance
he
argued
all
three
of
the
sloops
were
leaky
and
needed
a
thorough
overhauling
in
various
ways
as
soon
as
the
was
off
the
bar
therefore
they
proceeded
up
the
estuary
for
a
distance
of
nearly
two
miles
and
secured
their
vessels
in
shallow
water
where
they
could
be
careened
at
low
tide
next
morning
and
for
many
hot
days
thereafter
the
pirates
and
their
prisoners
toiled
hard
at
the
refitting
of
the
ships
lumber
was
not
easy
to
come
by
in
that
desolate
region
and
when
they
had
used
up
all
their
spare
planking
bonnet
took
the
out
over
the
bar
to
hunt
for
the
wherewithal
to
do
his
patching
after
a
cruise
of
a
day
and
a
night
to
the
southward
they
sighted
a
small
fishing
shallop
which
they
quickly
overtook
and
captured
without
a
fight
the
two
men
in
the
shallop
jumped
overboard
and
swam
ashore
when
they
saw
the
black
flag
and
bonnet
was
too
much
occupied
in
getting
the
prize
back
to
the
to
give
chase
it
was
an
unfortunate
thing
for
him
that
he
did
not
do
so
but
of
that
presently
the
shallop
was
run
into
the
and
broken
up
the
next
day
with
the
fresh
supply
of
lumber
thus
secured
the
work
of
repair
went
forward
undelayed
and
within
a
few
weeks
the
sloops
were
almost
ready
for
sea
again
chapter
xx
it
had
been
about
the
beginning
of
september
when
the
pirate
fleet
had
sighted
the
live
oaks
on
the
bars
of
the
cape
fear
river
to
bob
and
jeremy
those
first
days
were
uneventful
but
hardly
pleasant
through
the
long
still
afternoons
a
pitiless
sun
blazed
into
every
corner
of
the
deck
wide
flats
and
white
dunes
stretched
away
on
either
hand
only
the
line
of
woods
half
a
mile
distant
offered
a
suggestion
of
green
coolness
when
the
sun
had
set
the
held
the
heat
like
a
baker
oven
one
long
tossing
night
of
it
sufficed
for
the
two
boys
and
after
that
they
sought
a
corner
of
the
deck
away
from
the
snoring
seamen
and
lying
down
on
the
bare
planks
contrived
to
sleep
in
reasonable
comfort
the
days
were
spent
in
hard
work
for
the
most
part
a
good
deal
of
washing
and
cleaning
had
to
be
done
aboard
all
three
vessels
and
as
labor
requiring
no
special
skill
it
fell
frequently
to
the
lot
of
jeremy
and
bob
it
was
small
matter
to
them
whether
they
toiled
or
were
idle
for
the
blistering
sun
allowed
no
respite
and
it
seemed
preferable
to
sweat
over
something
useful
than
over
nothing
at
all
on
the
third
day
after
the
return
of
the
from
her
foraging
trip
jeremy
who
had
been
scraping
and
tarring
ropes
for
hours
on
end
straightened
his
back
with
a
discontented
grunt
and
looked
away
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
his
eyebrows
puckered
in
a
frown
bob
he
said
in
a
voice
too
low
for
any
of
their
shipmates
to
hear
bob
i
going
to
run
away
if
something
does
happen
soon
you
be
shot
like
as
not
answered
the
delaware
boy
well
shot
let
it
be
he
replied
doggedly
if
i
to
stay
aboard
here
all
my
life
i
be
shot
it
looks
like
the
best
chance
had
right
now
will
you
come
tonight
bob
thought
for
a
moment
i
not
afraid
of
their
catching
us
he
finally
said
it
the
indians
after
we
into
the
woods
you
say
you
know
the
indians
and
trust
them
as
long
as
they
are
treated
right
that
may
be
true
of
the
ones
you
known
but
these
tuscaroras
are
different
they
do
talk
the
same
language
and
those
words
you
learned
would
mayhap
go
for
curses
down
here
i
do
think
we
ought
to
try
it
jeremy
admitted
that
his
previous
acquaintance
stood
for
nothing
but
argued
from
the
fact
that
bonnet
had
been
trying
to
frighten
them
that
he
had
probably
exaggerated
the
danger
finally
not
wishing
to
leave
his
friend
if
he
could
help
it
he
agreed
to
abandon
the
plan
for
the
present
they
worked
at
the
till
suppertime
then
rose
wearily
stretching
and
went
for
their
and
biscuit
when
the
coarse
rations
were
eaten
it
was
nearly
sunset
jeremy
watched
the
sluggish
water
glide
by
below
the
canted
rail
till
at
last
small
quivering
blurs
of
light
the
reflections
of
stars
began
to
gleam
in
the
ripples
a
faint
breeze
sprung
up
with
the
coming
of
night
blew
across
the
sweltering
lagoon
bob
tired
out
fell
asleep
his
head
pillowed
on
the
deck
the
pirates
some
below
in
the
bunks
some
stretched
on
the
planking
lay
like
dead
men
after
the
hard
labor
of
the
day
even
the
regular
watch
slumbered
undisturbed
jeremy
thoughts
went
drifting
off
into
as
the
soft
black
water
lulled
him
with
its
unending
whisper
his
head
nodded
he
raised
it
striving
he
knew
not
why
to
keep
awake
the
gentle
crept
in
again
soothing
his
drowsy
ears
he
was
close
to
sleep
so
close
that
another
moment
would
have
taken
him
across
the
border
but
in
that
little
time
the
sharp
double
cry
of
a
heron
flying
high
over
the
lagoon
cut
the
night
air
and
startled
the
boy
broad
awake
as
he
stared
off
over
the
dim
whiteness
of
the
bars
his
senses
astretch
for
a
repetition
of
that
weird
call
there
was
a
faint
splashing
in
the
water
close
to
the
sloop
one
of
the
starpools
was
blotted
out
in
blackness
at
the
instant
he
turned
to
look
over
the
rail
the
heart
seemed
to
be
beating
against
the
roof
of
his
mouth
thoughts
of
alligators
crossed
his
mind
for
he
had
heard
of
them
from
the
pirates
who
had
plied
in
southern
waters
as
quietly
as
he
could
he
moved
to
the
rail
and
stood
staring
over
his
eyes
bulging
into
the
dark
and
his
breath
coming
short
and
fast
for
perhaps
a
minute
there
was
no
sight
nor
sound
but
the
lapping
water
of
the
lagoon
then
he
became
aware
of
a
whiteness
drifting
close
and
heard
a
familiar
voice
whispering
his
name
jeremy
jeremy
it
job
said
the
white
blotch
it
bumped
softly
along
the
side
and
at
last
the
boy
could
see
the
homely
features
of
his
old
friend
pale
through
the
gloom
there
was
a
loose
dragging
over
the
side
and
job
hand
feeling
along
the
woodwork
came
in
contact
with
it
better
not
try
to
come
aboard
whispered
jeremy
they
all
on
deck
here
can
you
take
us
off
there
was
silence
for
an
instant
as
job
felt
for
a
hold
in
one
of
the
gun
ports
then
he
raised
himself
till
his
head
was
level
with
the
deck
is
the
other
lad
there
he
asked
ay
replied
jeremy
he
here
but
he
will
have
to
be
wakened
illustration
do
say
a
word
sh
easy
there
are
you
awake
go
to
him
and
take
his
hand
begin
squeezing
and
press
harder
till
he
opens
his
eyes
do
startle
him
was
job
admonition
the
boy
did
as
he
was
bid
a
gentle
grip
on
the
delaware
lad
palm
brought
him
to
his
senses
jeremy
was
whispering
in
a
cool
steady
undertone
bob
that
the
lad
wake
up
bob
do
say
a
word
sh
easy
there
are
you
awake
when
he
was
rewarded
by
a
nod
of
comprehension
he
told
his
comrade
of
job
presence
and
the
chance
they
had
to
escape
bob
understood
in
a
moment
they
returned
to
the
rail
and
first
one
then
the
other
let
himself
quietly
down
holding
to
the
rope
jeremy
slipped
into
the
water
last
luckily
they
could
both
swim
though
the
sloop
was
so
near
the
beach
that
swimming
was
hardly
necessary
the
tall
crawled
out
upon
the
sand
in
the
lead
and
they
followed
him
quickly
over
a
dune
and
across
another
creek
they
were
now
far
enough
away
for
their
flight
to
be
unheard
and
job
began
to
run
the
boys
close
behind
him
they
made
a
good
mile
to
the
south
before
he
allowed
his
panting
runaways
to
stop
for
breath
there
in
the
reeds
beside
a
narrow
estuary
they
came
upon
a
small
dinghy
pulled
up
the
seaman
ran
the
boat
into
the
water
bundled
the
boys
into
the
bottom
astern
and
was
quickly
pulling
down
stream
along
the
sharp
windings
of
the
creek
when
they
had
put
three
miles
of
sand
and
water
behind
them
job
rested
on
his
oars
to
catch
his
breath
his
voice
came
through
the
hot
dark
pantingly
lucky
you
stood
up
an
came
to
the
rail
the
way
you
did
lad
he
said
i
did
know
just
how
i
was
to
reach
you
when
you
came
to
the
side
i
could
see
it
was
a
boy
an
knew
things
was
all
right
well
we
best
be
gettin
on
no
tellin
how
soon
they
may
find
gone
once
more
the
big
yankee
bowed
his
back
to
the
task
in
hand
and
a
silence
fell
broken
only
by
the
faint
sound
of
the
muffled
oars
and
the
swirl
of
water
along
the
sides
not
even
the
thrill
of
the
escape
could
keep
the
two
tired
boys
awake
and
it
was
nearly
an
hour
later
that
they
were
roused
by
voices
calling
at
no
great
distance
a
tall
black
mass
on
which
showed
a
single
moving
light
rose
out
of
the
gloom
ahead
the
hail
was
repeated
oh
there
job
howland
boat
ahoy
what
luck
well
replied
job
and
ran
in
under
the
ship
counter
a
line
was
let
down
and
as
soon
as
the
skiff
was
made
fast
bob
and
jeremy
and
their
deliverer
scrambled
up
to
the
open
port
there
was
shouting
and
a
moving
to
and
fro
of
lanterns
as
they
were
ushered
into
the
cabin
and
suddenly
a
tall
man
burst
through
the
door
at
the
farther
end
he
had
the
tattered
form
of
bob
curtis
in
his
arms
in
an
instant
and
great
boy
though
he
was
the
delaware
lad
hugged
his
father
ecstatically
and
wept
job
and
jeremy
pleased
as
they
were
to
see
this
reunion
were
hardly
comfortable
in
its
presence
and
made
a
vain
attempt
to
withdraw
gracefully
the
merchant
was
after
them
before
they
could
reach
the
door
here
howland
he
cried
holding
to
bob
with
one
hand
and
seizing
the
arm
with
the
other
do
you
try
to
leave
yet
gad
man
this
is
the
happiest
hour
i
had
in
years
i
owe
you
so
much
that
it
ca
be
put
in
figures
and
this
tall
lad
is
jeremy
that
told
me
of
look
at
the
sunburn
on
the
pair
of
pretty
desperate
characters
to
have
aboard
i
afraid
his
roar
of
laughter
was
joined
by
the
other
three
as
he
showed
the
way
to
a
couple
of
roomy
berths
built
in
at
the
end
of
the
cabin
the
two
boys
were
left
after
a
final
boisterous
and
proceeded
to
make
themselves
snug
between
the
linen
sheets
jeremy
had
never
slept
in
such
luxury
in
his
whole
life
and
moved
gingerly
for
fear
of
hurting
something
at
last
their
exhilaration
subsided
enough
for
the
rescued
lads
to
go
to
sleep
once
more
jeremy
last
thought
was
a
one
as
he
wondered
how
long
it
must
be
before
he
too
could
throw
himself
against
the
broad
homespun
wall
of
his
father
breast
chapter
xxi
when
they
woke
it
was
to
the
regular
heave
and
lurch
of
a
sailing
vessel
in
motion
and
jeremy
looking
out
the
port
beheld
the
crisp
sparkling
blue
of
open
sea
there
were
two
suits
of
clothes
upon
the
cabin
bench
and
into
these
the
boys
climbed
impatient
to
get
out
on
deck
the
ship
was
the
big
merchantman
though
bob
used
as
he
was
to
her
appearance
would
hardly
have
known
her
in
her
new
guise
long
lines
of
black
cannon
grimly
faced
the
open
ports
along
either
side
the
rail
had
been
built
up
solidly
to
a
height
of
about
six
feet
so
that
the
main
deck
was
now
a
typical
gun
deck
open
overhead
her
regular
crew
of
seasoned
mariners
was
augmented
by
as
many
more
longshoremen
all
good
men
picked
for
their
courage
and
fighting
ability
job
who
acted
as
second
mate
and
was
in
full
charge
of
the
gun
crews
took
the
boys
proudly
from
one
big
carronade
to
another
explaining
each
improvement
which
his
experience
or
ingenuity
had
devised
his
chief
pride
was
the
long
in
the
bows
she
was
a
swivel
gun
set
on
bearings
so
finely
adjusted
and
that
one
man
could
aim
her
job
patted
her
shiny
brass
rump
lovingly
as
he
looked
across
the
blue
swells
ahead
he
could
hardly
wait
for
the
hour
when
he
should
set
a
match
to
her
breach
clarke
curtis
joined
the
group
a
few
minutes
later
and
they
went
together
to
the
main
cabin
bob
father
ghent
the
captain
and
job
howland
settled
themselves
comfortably
over
long
pipes
and
glasses
of
port
and
prepared
to
hear
the
boys
story
jeremy
bashful
in
such
fine
company
was
persuaded
to
recount
his
adventures
from
the
time
job
had
gone
over
the
side
till
the
kidnapped
delaware
boy
had
come
aboard
then
bob
took
up
the
tale
and
told
with
much
spirit
of
the
storm
the
trip
up
the
chesapeake
and
the
subsequent
pursuit
of
the
off
the
capes
from
this
point
on
the
two
lads
told
the
story
together
eagerly
interrupting
each
other
to
put
in
some
incident
forgotten
for
the
moment
when
they
came
to
the
discovery

jeremy
lad
could
ye
draw
me
a
picture
of
what
was
like
the
boy
readily
consented
and
given
a
piece
of
paper
proceeded
to
set
down
from
his
memory
of
the
outline
and
from
the
general
measurements
he
had
taken
a
very
fair
copy
of
the
original
the
leaned
over
him
as
he
drew
and
shook
his
head
doubtfully
as
the
work
went
on
no
he
said
when
the
boy
had
finished
i
ca
recall
such
a
bay
just
this
minute
an
as
there
was
nothin
on
it
to
tell
where
it
might
be
i
do
know
as
there
anything
for
us
to
do
like
as
not
it
on
some
little
island
as
is
set
down
so
be
scant
use
to
look
over
the
charts
still
i
try
it
a
of
poring
over
the
maps
produced
no
result
there
were
bays
large
and
small
that
resembled
the
one
jeremy
had
drawn
but
none
closely
enough
to
warrant
the
belief
that
it
was
the
same
well
remarked
job
as
he
put
away
the
charts
daggs
never
live
to
reach
his
bay
he
swing
on
charles
town
dock
an
i
mistake
not
but
in
that
saying
at
least
the
proved
himself
no
prophet
the
light
wind
held
and
the
made
reasonable
speed
down
the
coast
for
nearly
two
days
then
after
drifting
under
short
sail
all
night
she
made
in
with
the
dawn
past
the
small
island
which
nearly
a
century
and
a
half
later
was
to
be
the
scene
of
a
great
war
beginning
crept
up
against
the
tide
till
noon
and
anchored
off
the
thriving
port
of
charles
town
curtis
and
job
went
ashore
in
the
cutter
as
soon
as
all
was
snug
aboard
on
landing
they
went
directly
to
the
house
governor
johnson
was
at
home
and
gladly
welcomed
the
delaware
merchant
who
was
an
old
acquaintance
of
his
when
they
had
been
shown
into
a
large
room
where
the
official
business
of
the
colony
was
transacted
curtis
proceeded
at
once
to
the
point
of
his
visit
he
learned
that
the
messenger
from
delaware
had
arrived
and
his
plea
for
aid
had
been
duly
considered
johnson
was
troubled
at
having
no
better
answer
for
his
friend
but
said
that
the
treasury
of
the
southern
colony
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
strain
put
upon
it
four
years
before
at
the
time
of
the
indian
massacres
he
believed
that
he
had
no
right
at
this
time
to
spend
the
public
funds
in
fitting
out
a
fleet
unless
it
was
to
avenge
an
injury
done
some
member
of
the
colony
his
honest
distress
at
being
unable
to
assist
was
so
obvious
that
neither
the
merchant
nor
his
chief
gunner
felt
like
urging
their
claim
for
help
curtis
told
of
the
rescue
of
the
two
boys
much
to
the
discomfort
of
the
blushing
job
and
they
rose
to
take
their
departure
feeling
no
ill
will
toward
the
governor
for
his
inability
to
help
them
as
they
started
to
go
out
of
the
room
a
loud
insistent
knock
was
heard
come
in
said
johnson
and
immediately
the
door
was
opened
to
admit
a
short
gentleman
very
much
flushed
as
to
the
face
and
whose
eyes
fairly
shot
forth
sparks
he
was
followed
by
two
other
men
dressed
in
rough
clothes
that
seemed
to
have
seen
recent
hard
usage
the
leader
advanced
with
rapid
steps
here
governor
he
said
those
confounded
pirates
are
at
us
again
here
two
of
my
men
gently
colonel
rhett
interrupted
the
governor
his
eyes
twinkling
allow
me
to
introduce
clarke
curtis
of
delaware
and
his
friend
howland
i
believe
your
business
and
theirs
will
fall
very
easily
into
one
track
pray
be
seated
gentlemen
the
colonel
shot
a
keen
glance
at
these
new
acquaintances
and
when
the
four
had
taken
chairs
around
the
table
began
again
more
calmly
to
tell
his
story
a
fishing
smack
one
of
a
open
boats
belonging
to
him
had
been
cruising
along
the
coast
to
the
eastward
the
week
before
and
when
about
forty
miles
west
of
cape
fear
had
sighted
a
large
black
sloop
under
great
spread
of
sail
bearing
down
upon
her
the
two
men
in
the
shallop
put
about
and
made
for
shore
as
fast
as
they
could
using
oars
and
canvas
alike
but
when
they
were
still
half
a
mile
out
they
saw
that
the
pursuing
ship
flew
a
black
pirate
flag
when
a
few
moments
after
a
round
shot
came
dangerously
close
to
their
stern
they
leaped
over
the
side
without
more
ado
and
succeeded
in
swimming
ashore
glad
to
come
out
of
the
adventure
with
whole
skins
after
a
perilous
journey
of
many
leagues
overland
they
had
just
arrived
in
charles
town
and
reported
the
affair
to
rhett
their
employer
so
you
see
said
the
colonel
in
conclusion
we
in
for
another
siege
of
the
kind
we
had
with
unless
we
take
some
quick
action
on
this
johnson
sat
thoughtful
for
a
moment
let
me
put
the
matter
up
to
you
exactly
as
it
now
stands
he
finally
said
there
is
a
little
money
in
the
treasury
but
to
buy
and
fit
out
properly
three
ships
would
drain
us
almost
as
dry
as
we
were
in
would
you
have
me
do
that
rhett
the
colonel
shook
his
head
no
he
replied
you
must
not
then
after
looking
at
the
floor
for
a
moment
he
stood
up
with
quick
decision
see
here
he
said
we
can
get
enough
volunteers
to
do
this
whole
business
or
my
name
not
william
rhett
curtis
thrust
out
a
big
hand
my
ship
guns
is
in
the
harbor
ready
for
sea
she
at
your
service
he
smiled
the
colonel
gripped
his
hand
delightedly
done
he
cried
and
now
let
see
what
other
commanders
we
can
recruit
will
you
give
me
a
commission
governor
and
receiving
an
affirmative
reply
he
led
the
way
down
to
the
docks
colonel
rhett
was
a
figure
in
charles
town
he
owned
a
large
plantation
a
few
miles
inland
and
conducted
a
fish
warehouse
as
well
among
tobacco
growers
townsmen
and
alike
he
was
widely
acquainted
and
respected
as
much
as
any
man
in
the
colony
his
courage
and
skill
as
a
soldier
were
proverbial
for
he
had
been
a
leader
in
the
suppression
of
the
indian
uprising
certainly
no
man
in
the
carolinas
was
better
fitted
for
the
task
which
he
had
in
hand
for
two
days
he
and
his
friends
from
the
fairly
lived
on
the
wharves
and
before
sunset
of
the
second
he
had
secured
the
services
of
two
sloops
the
captain
john
masters
and
the
captain
fayrer
hall
neither
ship
was
equipped
for
fighting
but
by
using
cannon
from
the
town
defences
and
borrowing
some
pieces
from
the
a
complement
of
eight
guns
for
each
sloop
was
made
up
on
september
the
three
ships
in
war
trim
and
carrying
in
their
combined
crews
nearly
men
crossed
the
charles
town
bar
just
before
they
sailed
news
had
come
in
that
the
notorious
pirate
charles
vane
had
passed
to
the
south
with
a
prize
and
rhett
first
course
was
laid
along
the
coast
in
that
direction
two
or
three
days
of
search
in
the
creeks
and
inlets
failed
to
reveal
any
sign
of
the
buccaneer
however
and
much
to
the
relief
of
the
impatient
curtis
they
put
about
for
cape
fear
on
the
eighteenth
the
progress
of
the
fleet
up
the
coast
was
slow
constant
rumors
of
pirates
were
received
and
every
hiding
place
on
the
shore
was
examined
as
they
went
along
bob
and
jeremy
wild
with
suppressed
excitement
could
hardly
brook
this
delay
for
as
they
warned
the
officers
of
the
expedition
repeatedly
there
was
every
reason
to
expect
that
bonnet
would
leave
the
river
soon
if
he
had
not
gone
already
for
this
reason
the
went
on
in
advance
of
the
others
and
patrolled
the
waters
off
the
headland
for
four
days
until
rhett
should
come
up
on
the
evening
of
the
he
made
his
appearance
and
as
there
was
still
light
they
decided
to
enter
the
the
tide
was
just
past
flood
rhett
flagship
the
nosed
in
first
over
the
bar
and
was
followed
by
the
the
great
advanced
to
within
a
few
lengths
of
the
entrance
but
the
soundings
showed
that
even
there
she
had
only
a
fathom
or
two
to
spare
and
would
certainly
come
to
grief
if
she
adventured
further
as
it
was
even
the
lighter
sloops
ran
aground
fifteen
minutes
later
and
were
not
launched
again
till
nearly
dawn
captain
ghent
had
anchored
the
big
ship
as
close
in
as
he
dared
and
she
sat
to
the
her
two
consorts
were
in
plain
sight
a
few
hundred
yards
inside
rhett
came
back
during
the
night
in
a
small
boat
and
held
a
council
of
war
with
curtis
ghent
and
job
howland
he
reported
that
a
party
of
pirates
in
longboats
had
come
down
river
during
the
evening
to
reconnoitre
but
had
beat
a
retreat
as
soon
as
they
had
seen
the
guns
it
was
decided
about
half
the
crew
of
the
should
be
added
to
the
force
of
men
on
the
two
sloops
while
the
big
vessel
herself
was
forced
to
be
content
with
standing
guard
off
the
entrance
this
was
a
bitter
blow
not
only
to
curtis
but
to
job
and
the
boys
who
had
looked
forward
to
the
battle
with
zest
bob
and
jeremy
had
been
ordered
to
bed
about
midnight
but
they
rose
before
light
in
their
excitement
and
sunrise
found
them
in
the
bows
with
job
watching
the
long
point
of
sand
behind
which
they
knew
the
pirates
lay
preparations
had
been
made
aboard
the
and
for
an
immediate
advance
up
the
river
hardly
had
the
first
slant
beams
of
sunlight
struck
upon
rhett
deck
before
the
crew
were
lustily
pulling
at
the
main
halyards
and
winding
in
the
anchor
chain
but
even
before
the
two
carolina
sloops
were
under
way
there
was
an
excited
chorus
of
here
he
comes
and
above
the
dune
at
the
bend
of
the
river
appeared
the
headsails
of
the
bonnet
had
weighed
his
chances
and
decided
for
a
running
fight
the
pirate
ship
cleared
the
point
nearly
a
mile
away
and
came
flying
down
every
inch
of
canvas
drawing
in
the
stiff
offshore
breeze
it
seemed
for
a
moment
as
if
she
might
get
safely
past
the
carolinians
and
out
to
sea
with
the
as
her
only
antagonist
probably
bonnet
had
counted
on
the
unexpectedness
of
his
maneuver
to
accomplish
this
result
but
if
so
he
had
left
out
of
his
reckoning
the
character
of
william
rhett
that
gentleman
hesitated
not
an
instant
but
headed
upstream
directly
toward
the
enemy
fortunately
he
had
two
good
skippers
in
masters
and
hall
for
the
good
colonel
himself
knew
little
of
sailing
thanks
to
these
lieutenants
the
two
attacking
sloops
were
let
off
the
wind
at
exactly
the
right
time
and
filled
away
down
the
river
close
together
off
the
pirate
starboard
bow
bonnet
raced
up
abeam
firing
broadsides
as
fast
as
his
men
could
load
and
his
cannonade
was
answered
in
kind
from
the
she
and
the
began
to
veer
over
to
port
forcing
the
black
sloop
closer
and
closer
to
shore
but
the
buccaneer
captain
refused
to
take
in
an
inch
of
sail
his
course
was
all
but
justified
the
speedy
craft
which
he
commanded
gained
on
her
foes
hand
over
hand
till
when
only
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
narrow
mouth
of
the
estuary
she
led
them
both
by
her
own
length
from
the
deck
of
the
jeremy
and
bob
could
pick
out
the
big
form
of
herriot
at
the
tiller
just
as
the
passed
into
the
lead
they
saw
him
swing
mightily
on
the
long
while
at
the
same
instant
the
main
sheet
was
hauled
in
it
was
prettily
done
the
pirate
went
hard
over
to
starboard
kicking
up
a
wave
of
spray
as
she
slewed
she
sprang
away
from
under
the
bows
of
the
with
only
inches
to
spare
for
the
bowsprit
of
rhett
sloop
tore
the
edge
of
her
mainsail
in
passing
the
fierce
cheer
that
rose
from
the
deck
of
the
black
buccaneer
was
drowned
in
a
jarring
crash
she
had
eluded
her
foe
only
to
run
ten
seconds
later
upon
a
submerged
sand
bar
it
was
now
the
carolinians
turn
to
cheer
though
it
soon
appeared
that
they
might
better
have
saved
their
breath
for
other
purposes
the
unable
to
check
her
speed
ran
straight
ahead
and
hardly
a
minute
after
her
enemy
mishap
was
hard
aground
twenty
yards
away
both
sloops
lay
careened
to
starboard
so
that
the
whole
deck
of
the
offered
a
fair
target
for
bonnet
musketry
while
the
port
side
was
thrown
up
a
stout
defence
against
the
fire
of
men
owing
to
the
slant
of
their
decks
it
was
impossible
to
train
the
cannon
of
either
ship
the
meanwhile
in
an
effort
to
cut
off
the
course
of
the
pirate
had
put
over
straight
for
the
channel
mouth
and
before
she
could
come
about
her
bows
also
were
fast
in
the
sand
and
she
lay
stern
toward
the
other
two
but
out
of
unable
to
take
a
hand
in
the
hot
fight
that
followed
had
either
the
crew
or
the
buccaneers
been
able
to
send
a
proper
broadside
from
their
position
it
seems
that
they
must
surely
have
blown
their
foe
out
of
water
though
we
need
of
course
to
make
allowance
for
the
comparative
feebleness
of
their
ordnance
in
contrast
to
that
of
the
present
day
the
stranding
of
the
three
vessels
had
occupied
so
short
a
time
that
the
little
group
of
witnesses
high
up
in
the
bow
of
the
had
not
yet
exchanged
a
word
clinging
to
the
rail
they
had
seen
the
pirate
make
her
bold
dash
across
the
bows
of
her
pursuers
only
to
strike
the
bar
in
her
instant
of
triumph
then
following
with
the
quickness
of
events
in
a
dream
the
grounding
first
of
the
afterwards
of
the
nor
was
there
an
appreciable
pause
in
the
spectacle
for
the
pirates
who
had
been
shooting
steadily
during
the
race
down
river
wasted
no
time
in
trying
to
get
off
the
bar
but
raked
their
nearby
deck
with
a
withering
fire
rhett
crew
tumbled
into
the
scuppers
where
they
were
under
the
partial
cover
of
the
bulwark
but
many
were
killed
even
before
they
could
reach
this
shelter
and
living
and
dead
rolled
down
together
as
in
a
ghastly
comedy
chapter
xxii
the
boys
intent
upon
this
awful
scene
turned
as
a
shout
from
job
howland
swelled
above
the
uproar
the
big
gunner
was
at
the
breach
of
his
ramrod
in
hand
the
little
group
scattered
to
one
side
or
the
other
leaving
an
open
space
at
the
bow
rail
at
the
same
moment
job
put
in
his
powder
a
heavy
charge
ramming
it
home
quickly
but
with
all
care
on
top
of
the
wadding
went
the
which
was
in
its
turn
hammered
down
under
the
powerful
strokes
of
the
ramrod
maneuvering
the
breech
with
both
hands
the
tall
yankee
trained
his
cannon
upon
the
pirate
sloop
allowed
for
distance
raising
the
muzzle
an
inch
or
more
nosed
the
wind
and
glanced
at
the
foremast
pennons
then
swung
his
piece
a
fraction
of
an
inch
to
windward
at
last
with
a
shout
of
fire
he
sprang
back
and
laid
his
match
to
the
there
was
a
spurt
of
flame
as
the
long
nine
roared
above
the
staccato
bark
of
the
musketry
then
they
saw
a
section
of
the
pirate
upper
rail
leap
clear
of
her
deck
and
fall
overside
too
high
said
job
shortly
though
ghent
and
curtis
had
cheered
at
the
shot
for
the
distance
was
a
good
job
worked
feverishly
at
his
reloading
helped
by
others
of
the
gun
crews
again
the
charge
was
a
stout
one
but
this
time
the
gunner
laid
his
muzzle
pointblank
at
the
top
of
the
rail
allowing
only
for
wind
once
more
he
fired
just
short
of
the
went
up
a
little
tower
of
spray
job
said
not
a
word
but
set
his
great
angular
jaws
and
went
about
his
work
with
all
the
speed
he
had
look
said
jeremy
to
bob
in
a
sudden
burst
of
understanding
the
tide
rising
see
how
it
runs
in
past
our
bows
in
another
five
minutes
one
of
those
boats
will
be
afloat
watch
how
the
rocks
up
and
down
already
if
she
gets
off
first
it
go
hard
with
rhett
for
bonnet
let
off
a
broadside
as
soon
as
his
guns
are
level
that
why
job
trying
so
hard
to
put
a
hole
in
her
almost
as
he
spoke
the
report
of
the
third
shot
rolled
out
the
buccaneer
sloop
jumped
sharply
like
a
spurred
horse
in
her
side
just
at
the
water
line
a
black
streak
had
suddenly
appeared
the
waves
of
the
incoming
tide
no
longer
swayed
her
buoyantly
for
she
wallowed
on
the
bar
like
a
log
the
effect
of
the
shot
though
it
could
be
seen
from
the
where
it
was
greeted
with
cheers
was
still
unknown
aboard
the
in
the
wash
of
water
as
the
tide
rolled
in
sloop
stood
almost
on
an
even
keel
the
remnant
of
his
crew
appeared
to
have
taken
heart
for
a
brisk
fire
now
answered
that
of
the
buccaneers
suddenly
a
triumphant
shouting
began
aboard
the
stranded
flagship
soon
answered
in
increasing
volume
from
her
two
consorts
the
was
moving
slowly
off
the
bar
on
the
black
sloop
there
was
a
silence
as
of
death
stede
bonnet
late
gentleman
of
the
island
of
barbadoes
honorably
discharged
as
major
from
the
army
of
his
majesty
since
turned
for
no
apparent
cause
and
now
one
of
the
most
notorious
plunderers
of
the
coast
faced
his
last
fight
outnumbered
nearly
ten
to
one
his
ship
a
stranded
hulk
his
cannon
useless
surely
he
read
his
doom
his
men
read
it
and
turned
sullenly
to
haul
down
the
tattered
rag
of
black
that
still
hung
from
the
masthead
but
a
last
blaze
of
the
old
mad
courage
flared
up
in
the
captain
as
he
faced
them
dishevelled
and
bloody
from
behind
cocked
pistols
above
the
tumult
of
the
fusillade
his
voice
usually
so
clear
rose
hoarse
with
anger
i
scatter
the
deck
with
the
brains
of
any
man
who
will
not
fight
to
the
end
he
cried
for
a
second
the
issue
was
in
doubt
in
another
instant
the
iron
spell
he
held
over
his
men
must
have
won
them
back
herriot
was
already
running
to
his
side
but
before
he
reached
his
chief
a
louder
cheer
from
the
attacking
sloops
made
him
turn
the
black
roger
fluttered
downward
to
the
deck
one
of
the
captive
sailors
from
the
fearing
to
be
taken
for
a
pirate
if
it
came
to
had
crept
up
behind
the
mast
and
cut
the
flag
halyards
the
men
hearts
fell
with
the
falling
ensign
and
they
stood
irresolute
while
the
went
up
alongside
there
was
now
water
enough
for
her
to
come
close
aboard
and
when
she
stood
at
a
length
distant
colonel
rhett
appeared
at
the
rail
he
pointed
to
the
muzzles
of
four
loaded
cannon
aboard
his
sloop
and
told
bonnet
that
he
would
proceed
to
blow
him
into
the
air
if
he
did
not
surrender
in
one
minute
time
there
was
little
parley
the
pirate
captain
flare
of
resistance
had
burned
out
and
pale
and
strangely
shaken
he
handed
over
his
sword
and
submitted
to
the
disarming
of
his
men
it
was
now
well
along
in
the
morning
the
prisoners
whom
rhett
had
taken
were
rowed
out
in
small
boats
across
the
bar
and
put
aboard
the
one
by
one
they
were
hauled
over
the
side
and
placed
below
in
chains
job
jeremy
and
bob
stood
at
a
little
distance
and
counted
those
who
had
been
captured
now
and
then
they
were
greeted
by
an
ugly
look
and
a
curse
as
some
old
shipmate
recognized
them
last
of
all
major
bonnet
passed
haggard
and
unkempt
his
head
bowed
in
shame
in
all
finished
job
guess
our
old
and
handsome
friend
pharaoh
daggs
must
have
got
his
gruel
in
that
fight
well
if
ever
man
deserved
to
die
a
violent
death
it
him
i
like
to
make
sure
though
want
to
go
over
to
the
with
me
both
boys
welcomed
the
opportunity
and
as
the
longboat
was
just
then
starting
back
they
were
soon
aboard
the
battered
pirate
so
recently
their
home
three
or
four
dead
men
lay
on
the
canted
deck
for
no
effort
had
been
made
as
yet
to
clean
the
ship
bob
and
jeremy
had
no
stomach
for
looking
at
the
corpses
of
their
erstwhile
companions
and
turned
rather
to
explore
the
cabin
and
leaving
job
to
hunt
for
the
body
of
their
old
enemy
in
the
long
bunkroom
some
water
had
entered
with
the
rising
tide
and
they
found
the
lower
side
a
miniature
lake
in
the
seamen
chests
floated
past
like
houses
in
a
flood
one
of
the
big
boxes
was
open
half
its
contents
trailing
after
it
something
familiar
about
the
cover
and
the
blue
cloth
that
hung
over
the
side
made
jeremy
start
daggs
chest
he
exclaimed
and
reached
forward
pulling
it
up
on
the
dry
planking
the
two
boys
delved
into
the
damp
rubbish
it
held
there
were
a
few
clothes
a
rusty
pistol
an
able
seaman
certificate
crumpled
and
torn
almost
beyond
recognition
the
sack
of
money
and
the
chart
were
gone
after
searching
in
dark
corners
of
the
and
fishing
in
the
pool
of
leakage
without
discovering
what
they
sought
the
boys
returned
to
the
box
odd
said
jeremy
at
length
every
other
chest
is
locked
fast
why
should
he
have
opened
his
this
seemed
unanswerable
they
returned
to
the
deck
to
find
job
peering
into
the
green
water
overside
the
body
not
here
said
the
big
seaman
unless
he
fell
over
the
rail
or
was
thrown
over
looking
to
see
if
it
down
there
the
sand
shone
clean
and
white
through
the
shallow
water
on
every
side
no
trace
of
the
buccaneer
was
to
be
seen
jeremy
told
of
finding
the
open
chest
hm
mused
job
looks
like
he
got
away
though
he
may
be
dead
i
like
to
know
for
sure
still
he
added
his
face
clearing
chances
are
we
never
see
nor
hear
of
him
again
and
putting
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
out
of
their
thoughts
they
rejoined
their
friends
on
the
big
merchantman
just
before
nightfall
the
carolina
sloops
which
had
made
an
expedition
up
the
river
returned
with
bonnet
two
prizes
in
tow
they
had
been
abandoned
in
the
effort
to
escape
and
rhett
had
launched
them
without
difficulty
a
great
sound
of
hammering
filled
the
air
above
the
desert
lagoon
for
two
days
the
old
now
so
rechristened
since
she
had
fallen
into
honest
hands
had
to
be
floated
for
there
was
still
service
in
her
shattered
black
hull
a
hundred
men
toiled
on
and
around
her
and
in
a
remarkably
short
time
a
jury
patch
was
made
in
her
gaping
side
and
her
hold
pumped
dry
then
crews
were
picked
to
man
the
three
captured
sloops
and
the
flotilla
was
ready
to
return
triumphant
on
the
morning
when
they
stood
out
to
sea
the
twelve
men
of
rhett
party
who
had
been
killed
in
action
were
buried
with
military
honors
saluted
by
the
cannon
of
the
fleet
a
voyage
of
three
days
unmarred
by
any
accident
brought
the
victorious
squadron
into
charles
town
harbor
joy
knew
no
bounds
among
the
merchants
and
seamen
along
the
docks
indeed
the
rejoicing
spread
through
the
town
to
the
tune
of
church
bells
and
the
whole
colony
was
soon
made
aware
of
rhett
victory
when
the
buccaneers
had
been
taken
ashore
under
a
heavy
guard
and
locked
up
in
the
public
watchhouse
curtis
and
bob
with
job
and
jeremy
went
ashore
to
stretch
their
legs
it
was
a
fine
fall
day
warm
as
midsummer
to
jeremy
way
of
thinking
the
docks
were
fascinatingly
full
of
merchandise
great
hogsheads
of
molasses
and
rum
from
jamaica
set
ashore
from
newly
arrived
ships
shouldered
for
room
with
baled
cotton
and
boxes
of
tobacco
ready
to
be
loaded
there
was
a
smell
of
spices
and
hot
tar
where
the
sun
beat
down
on
the
white
decks
and
tall
spars
of
the
shipping
negroes
hitherto
almost
unknown
to
the
yankee
boy
handled
bales
and
barrels
on
the
wharves
their
gleaming
black
bodies
naked
to
the
waist
planters
from
the
fertile
country
behind
the
town
rode
in
with
their
attendant
black
boys
and
gathered
at
the
on
king
charles
street
it
was
to
one
of
these
the
scarlet
fish
that
the
bluff
delaware
man
took
his
protégés
for
dinner
the
place
was
resplendent
with
polished
deal
and
shining
pewter
curtains
of
brightly
colored
stuff
hung
at
the
high
square
windows
and
on
the
side
where
the
sun
entered
pots
of
flowers
stood
in
the
broad
there
were
gay
groups
of
men
at
the
tables
and
talk
of
the
pirates
was
going
everywhere
over
the
madeira
and
chocolate
it
seemed
the
news
of
job
gunnery
had
been
spread
by
rhett
men
for
some
of
the
diners
recognized
and
pointed
to
him
a
pretty
barmaid
with
dimples
in
her
elbows
curtsied
low
as
she
set
down
his
cup
oh
yes
captain
howland
she
answered
as
he
gave
his
order
blushed
a
deep
pink
and
ran
to
the
kitchen
whereupon
job
quite
overcome
vowed
that
the
ladies
of
carolina
were
the
fairest
in
the
world
and
curtis
roared
heartily
saying
that
captain
howland
it
should
be
and
that
before
many
months
if
he
knew
a
good
seadog
as
they
sat
and
sipped
their
coffee
after
a
meal
that
reflected
glory
upon
the
cook
of
the
scarlet
fish
colonel
rhett
came
in
and
made
his
way
to
their
table
through
a
of
and
bravos
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
sit
down
in
peace
he
drew
curtis
a
little
aside
to
talk
in
private
the
two
boys
were
content
to
watch
the
changing
scene
and
listen
to
the
hearty
badinage
of
the
fashionable
young
blades
about
the
tables
it
was
you
must
remember
jeremy
first
experience
of
luxury
unless
the
good
clean
quarters
and
wholesome
meals
aboard
the
could
be
so
called
he
had
never
read
any
book
except
the
bible
had
never
seen
more
than
a
pictures
in
his
life
from
these
and
from
the
conversation
of
backwoodsmen
and
more
recently
of
pirates
he
had
been
forced
to
form
all
his
conceptions
of
the
world
outside
of
his
own
experience
it
is
a
tribute
to
his
clean
traditions
and
sturdy
that
he
sat
unabashed
pleased
with
the
color
the
gayety
the
richness
but
able
still
to
distinguish
the
fine
things
from
the
sham
the
honest
things
from
those
which
only
appeared
honest
to
feel
a
thrill
of
pride
in
his
father
hard
life
and
his
own
colonel
rhett
conference
with
curtis
being
over
the
score
was
paid
and
the
party
took
their
triumphal
way
to
the
door
job
turning
his
sunburned
face
once
or
twice
to
glance
regretfully
after
the
dimpled
barmaid
that
afternoon
they
were
taken
to
the
governor
house
where
job
and
each
of
the
boys
told
the
story
of
their
experiences
in
company
these
stories
were
sworn
to
as
affidavits
and
kept
for
use
in
the
coming
trial
of
the
pirate
crew
it
was
a
special
dispensation
of
the
governor
which
allowed
them
to
give
their
evidence
in
this
form
instead
of
waiting
in
charles
town
for
the
court
to
sit
and
needless
to
say
they
were
heartily
glad
of
it
the
formalities
over
governor
johnson
led
the
party
into
the
adjoining
room
he
motioned
them
to
sit
down
and
faced
them
with
a
smile
now
my
lads
said
he
the
spoil
taken
on
the
has
been
divided
and
though
as
you
may
guess
it
had
to
go
a
long
way
there
a
share
left
for
each
of
you
jeremy
and
bob
stared
at
each
other
and
at
their
friends
the
benign
smiles
of
curtis
colonel
rhett
and
job
showed
that
they
had
known
beforehand
of
this
surprise
the
governor
was
holding
out
a
small
leather
sack
in
each
hand
here
catch
he
laughed
and
the
two
astonished
lads
automatically
did
as
they
were
bid
in
each
purse
there
was
something
over
twenty
guineas
in
gold
before
they
had
found
words
to
thank
the
governor
he
laughed
again
merrily
never
mind
a
speech
of
acceptance
said
he
colonel
rhett
here
has
something
else
for
you
yes
replied
the
colonel
you
see
there
was
a
deal
of
junk
in
the
captain
cabin
that
comes
to
me
as
admiral
of
the
expedition
i
be
much
pleased
if
you
two
lads
would
each
pick
out
anything
that
pleases
you
as
a
personal
gift
from
myself
and
stede
bonnet
as
he
spoke
he
took
the
cloth
cover
from
a
table
which
stood
at
one
side
on
it
the
boys
saw
a
shining
array
of
small
arms
some
glass
and
silver
decanters
and
a
pile
of
books
the
colonel
motioned
bob
forward
here
you
are
lad
take
your
choice
he
said
bob
stepped
to
the
table
and
glanced
over
the
weapons
eagerly
he
finally
selected
a
pistol
with
the
great
pirate
name
engraved
on
the
butt
and
went
with
pride
to
show
it
to
his
father
it
was
jeremy
turn
he
had
no
hesitation
from
the
moment
he
had
heard
the
offer
his
shining
eyes
had
been
fastened
upon
one
object
and
now
he
went
straight
to
the
table
and
picked
up
the
biggest
and
thickest
of
the
heap
of
books
a
great
volume
bunyan
progress
it
is
not
the
least
inexplicable
fact
in
the
career
of
the
terrible
stede
bonnet
that
he
was
a
constant
reader
of
such
books
as
this
and
the
paradise
lost
of
milton
bunyan
great
allegory
had
come
at
last
into
a
place
where
it
could
do
more
good
than
in
the
cabin
bookshelf
of
a
buccaneer
jeremy
poor
lad
uneducated
save
for
the
rude
lessons
of
his
father
and
the
training
of
the
open
had
longed
for
books
ever
since
he
could
remember
he
had
affected
a
gruff
scorn
when
bob
had
spoken
from
his
knowledge
but
inwardly
it
had
been
his
sole
ground
for
jealousy
of
the
delaware
boy
that
ponderous
leather
book
was
read
many
times
and
thoroughly
in
after
years
and
it
became
the
foundation
of
such
a
library
as
was
not
often
met
with
in
the
colonies
job
gave
the
lad
an
understanding
smile
and
a
pat
on
the
back
for
jeremy
had
told
him
of
his
passion
for
an
education
the
four
grown
men
drank
each
other
health
and
separated
with
many
hearty
handclasps
an
hour
later
the
anchor
was
up
and
she
was
moving
out
to
sea
upon
the
tide
cheered
vigorously
from
the
docks
and
saluted
by
every
vessel
she
passed
the
warm
september
dusk
settled
over
the
ocean
a
soft
land
breeze
rustled
in
the
shrouds
and
the
great
sails
filled
with
a
gentle
flapping
slowly
the
tall
ship
bowed
herself
to
the
northeast
and
settled
away
on
her
course
contentedly
while
the
water
ran
with
a
smooth
murmur
beneath
her
forefoot
jeremy
lying
in
his
bunk
where
a
single
star
shone
through
the
open
port
thought
it
the
sweetest
sound
he
had
ever
heard
he
was
homeward
bound
at
last
illustration
chapter
xxiii
there
were
brave
days
aboard
the
as
she
voyaged
up
the
coast
days
of
sun
and
light
winds
when
the
boys
sat
lazily
in
the
blue
shadow
of
the
sails
looking
off
through
eyes
toward
the
faint
line
of
shore
that
appeared
and
disappeared
to
leeward
or
listened
to
job
long
tales
of
adventure
up
and
down
the
high
seas
or
fished
with
over
the
taffrail
happy
if
they
pulled
up
even
a
flounder
twice
they
ran
into
fog
and
on
those
days
when
the
wet
dripped
dismally
off
the
shrouds
and
the
watch
on
deck
sang
mournful
airs
in
the
gray
gloom
the
two
lads
settled
into
big
chairs
in
the
cabin
beneath
a
mighty
brass
and
while
bob
sat
bemused
over
captain
dampier
voyages
jeremy
fought
apollyon
with
that
good
knight
christian
in
pilgrim
progress
but
best
of
all
were
the
days
of
howling
fair
weather
when
sky
and
sea
were
deep
blue
and
the
wind
boomed
over
out
of
the
west
and
the
scattered
flecks
of
white
cloud
raced
with
the
flying
spray
below
then
all
hands
would
stand
by
to
slack
a
sheet
here
or
reef
a
sail
there
and
ghent
who
was
a
bold
sailor
would
take
the
kicking
tiller
with
job
help
and
keep
the
big
ship
on
her
course
the
last
possible
foot
of
canvas
straining
at
the
yardarms
high
along
the
weather
rail
with
the
wind
screaming
in
their
ears
or
down
in
the
lee
scuppers
where
the
green
passed
close
below
with
a
roar
and
a
rush
the
boys
would
cling
yelling
aloud
their
exultation
it
was
more
than
the
risk
more
than
the
dizzy
movement
that
made
them
happy
with
every
hour
of
that
strong
wind
they
were
ten
knots
farther
north
so
they
sailed
and
one
morning
when
the
mist
cleared
curtis
led
both
boys
to
the
port
rail
to
show
them
where
the
green
head
of
cape
henlopen
stood
abeam
there
was
moisture
in
the
corners
of
his
eyes
as
he
pointed
to
it
thank
god
bob
my
lad
you
here
to
see
the
delaware
again
he
said
huskily
up
the
blue
bay
they
cruised
in
the
fine
october
weather
and
came
in
due
time
a
very
long
time
it
seemed
to
some
aboard
to
the
roadstead
opposite
new
castle
port
there
was
a
boat
over
almost
before
the
anchor
was
dropped
and
a
picked
crew
rowed
the
curtises
job
and
jeremy
ashore
as
fast
as
they
dared
without
breaking
oars
they
drew
up
across
the
swirling
tidewater
to
the
foot
of
a
long
pier
it
was
black
with
people
who
cheered
continually
and
somewhere
above
the
town
a
cannon
was
fired
in
salute
but
all
bob
saw
was
a
slender
figure
in
white
at
the
and
all
he
heard
was
a
woman
happy
crying
a
message
to
his
mother
telling
of
his
safety
had
been
sent
from
charles
town
three
weeks
before
and
there
she
was
to
welcome
him
there
was
a
ladder
further
in
along
the
pier
but
before
they
reached
it
some
one
had
thrown
a
rope
and
bob
swarmed
up
hand
over
hand
jeremy
stricken
with
a
sudden
shyness
watched
the
happy
tearful
scene
that
followed
from
the
boat
below
women
had
had
small
part
in
his
own
life
since
his
mother
death
he
had
known
a
few
in
the
frontier
settlements
and
they
had
been
good
to
him
in
a
friendly
way
but
this
ecstatic
was
new
and
it
made
him
feel
awkward
and
lonely
it
seemed
that
all
delaware
colony
must
be
at
the
waterfront
every
soul
in
the
little
town
and
men
from
miles
around
had
turned
out
to
welcome
the
returning
vessel
for
the
news
of
bonnet
defeat
had
been
brought
in
days
before
by
a
carolina
coaster
there
was
bunting
over
doorways
and
cheering
in
the
streets
as
the
governor
coach
with
the
party
of
honor
drove
up
the
main
thoroughfare
to
the
curtis
house
when
they
were
within
and
the
laughing
crowds
had
dispersed
mother
came
to
jeremy
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
looked
long
into
his
face
she
was
a
frail
slip
of
a
woman
dark
like
her
son
with
a
sensitive
mouth
and
big
black
eyes
full
of
courage
jeremy
flushed
a
slow
scarlet
under
her
gaze
but
his
eyes
never
flinched
as
he
returned
it
a
fine
boy
she
said
at
length
and
my
own
boy
good
friend
then
she
smiled
tenderly
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
jeremy
was
then
and
there
won
over
all
women
were
angels
of
light
to
him
from
that
moment
that
night
alone
in
the
white
wilderness
of
his
first
the
poor
new
england
boy
missed
his
mother
very
hard
more
perhaps
than
he
had
ever
missed
her
before
he
fell
asleep
on
a
pillow
that
was
wet
in
spots
and
he
was
not
ashamed
in
the
days
that
followed
nothing
in
delaware
colony
was
too
good
for
the
young
heroes
jeremy
could
never
understand
just
they
were
heroes
but
was
forced
to
give
up
trying
to
explain
the
matter
to
an
admiring
populace
as
for
bob
he
gleefully
accepted
all
the
glory
that
was
offered
and
at
last
persuaded
jeremy
to
take
the
affair
as
philosophically
as
himself
they
were
in
a
fair
way
to
be
spoiled
but
fortunately
there
was
enough
sense
of
humor
between
them
to
bring
them
off
safe
from
the
gentlemen
and
tearfully
rapturous
ladies
who
gathered
at
the
brick
house
of
afternoons
perhaps
the
thing
that
really
saved
them
from
the
effects
of
too
much
petting
was
the
trip
up
the
brandywine
to
the
curtis
plantation
it
was
a
fine
ride
of
thirty
miles
and
the
trail
led
through
woods
just
turning
red
and
yellow
with
the
autumn
frosts
jeremy
though
he
had
been
on
a
horse
only
half
a
dozen
times
in
his
life
was
a
natural
athlete
and
without
fear
he
was
quick
to
learn
and
imitated
bob
erect
carriage
and
easy
seat
so
well
that
long
before
they
had
reached
their
end
he
backed
his
tall
roan
like
an
with
job
it
was
a
different
matter
he
was
all
sailor
and
though
the
times
demanded
that
every
man
who
travelled
must
do
it
in
the
saddle
the
lank
new
englander
would
have
ridden
a
gale
any
day
in
preference
to
a
steed
even
jeremy
could
afford
to
laugh
at
the
sorry
figure
his
big
friend
made
the
trail
they
followed
was
no
more
than
a
rough
cutting
eight
or
ten
feet
wide
running
through
the
forest
here
and
there
paths
branched
off
to
right
or
left
and
up
one
of
these
bob
turned
at
noon
it
led
them
over
a
wooded
hill
then
down
a
long
slope
into
the
valley
of
a
stream
john
cantwell
plantation
we
stop
here
for
a
bite
to
eat
explained
the
boy
by
the
water
side
in
a
wide
clearing
was
a
group
of
log
huts
and
farther
along
a
square
house
built
of
rough
gray
stone
they
rode
up
to
the
wide
door
which
looked
down
upon
the
river
in
answer
to
bob
hail
a
colored
boy
in
a
red
jacket
ran
out
to
take
the
horses
heads
and
four
black
and
white
fox
terriers
tore
round
the
corner
barking
a
chorus
of
welcome
bob
jumped
down
with
a
laughing
ah
there
rufus
to
the
and
proceeded
to
roll
the
excited
little
dogs
on
their
backs
as
jeremy
and
job
dismounted
a
big
man
in
sober
gray
came
to
the
doorway
his
strong
kindly
face
broke
into
a
smile
as
he
caught
sight
of
his
visitors
well
bob
i
mightily
glad
to
see
thee
back
lad
we
got
news
from
the
town
only
yesterday
he
strode
down
the
steps
and
took
the
boy
hand
in
a
hearty
grip
then
greeted
the
others
as
bob
introduced
them
jeremy
marvelled
much
at
the
cut
of
the
man
coat
which
was
without
a
collar
and
at
his
continual
use
of
the
plain
and
but
there
was
a
direct
simplicity
about
all
his
ways
and
a
gentleness
in
his
eyes
that
won
the
boy
to
him
instantly
one
moment
only
he
wandered
at
john
cantwell
in
the
next
he
had
forgotten
everything
about
him
and
stood
gazing
at
the
square
doorway
in
the
frame
of
it
had
appeared
a
little
girl
of
twelve
she
was
dressed
demurely
in
gray
set
off
with
a
bit
of
white
kerchief
her
long
skirt
hid
her
toes
and
her
hands
were
folded
most
properly
but
above
this
sober
stalk
bloomed
the
fairest
face
that
jeremy
had
ever
seen
she
had
merry
hazel
eyes
a
straight
little
nose
and
a
firm
little
chin
her
plain
bonnet
had
fallen
back
from
her
head
and
the
brown
curls
that
strayed
recklessly
about
her
cheeks
seemed
to
catch
all
the
sunbeams
in
delaware
for
a
very
little
time
she
stood
and
then
the
pursed
red
mouth
could
be
controlled
no
longer
she
opened
it
in
a
whoop
of
joy
and
catching
up
her
skirts
ran
to
smother
bob
in
a
great
hug
next
moment
jeremy
still
in
a
daze
was
bowing
over
her
hand
as
he
had
learned
to
do
at
new
castle
she
dropped
him
a
little
curtsey
and
turned
to
meet
job
betty
cantwell
and
her
father
were
quakers
from
the
penn
colony
to
the
north
bob
had
time
to
tell
jeremy
as
they
entered
that
accounted
for
the
staid
simplicity
of
their
dress
and
their
quaint
form
of
speech
the
plain
language
as
it
was
called
jeremy
had
heard
of
the
quakers
though
in
new
england
they
were
much
persecuted
for
their
beliefs
by
the
puritans
here
apparently
people
not
only
allowed
them
to
live
but
liked
and
honored
them
as
well
he
prayed
fervently
that
betty
might
never
chance
to
visit
boston
town
yet
already
he
half
hoped
that
she
would
of
course
he
would
have
grown
bigger
by
then
and
would
carry
a
sword
and
how
he
would
prick
the
thin
legs
of
the
first
grim
deacon
who
dared
so
much
as
to
speak
to
her
these
imaginings
were
put
to
rout
at
the
door
by
the
delicious
savor
of
roast
turkey
one
of
the
black
farmhands
had
shot
the
great
bird
the
day
before
and
the
three
travellers
had
arrived
just
at
the
fortunate
moment
when
it
was
to
be
carved
it
was
a
dinner
never
to
be
forgotten
the
twenty
miles
they
had
ridden
through
the
crisp
air
would
have
given
them
an
appetite
even
had
they
not
been
normally
good
trenchermen
and
there
were
fine
white
potatoes
and
yams
that
accompanied
the
turkey
not
to
mention
some
jelly
which
betty
admitted
having
made
herself
with
cook
help
bob
joyfully
attacked
his
plate
and
ate
with
relish
every
minute
that
he
was
not
talking
jeremy
could
say
not
a
word
for
opposite
him
was
betty
and
in
her
presence
he
felt
very
large
and
awkward
his
hands
troubled
him
indeed
had
it
been
a
possibility
he
would
have
eaten
his
turkey
without
raising
them
above
the
table
edge
as
it
was
he
felt
himself
blush
every
time
a
vast
red
fist
came
in
evidence
yet
he
succeeded
in
making
a
good
meal
and
would
not
have
been
elsewhere
for
all
solomon
brig
gold
perhaps
job
who
was
neither
talkative
nor
under
the
spell
of
a
lady
eyes
wielded
the
best
knife
and
fork
of
the
three
dinner
over
and
bob
story
finished
they
were
taken
to
see
the
stable
and
the
broad
tilled
fields
by
the
river
bank
where
corn
stood
shocked
among
the
stubble
afternoon
came
and
soon
it
was
time
for
them
to
start
there
were
laughing
farewells
and
a
promise
that
they
would
stop
on
the
return
trip
and
before
jeremy
could
come
back
to
earth
the
gloom
of
the
forest
shut
in
above
their
heads
once
more
they
put
the
horses
to
a
canter
as
soon
as
the
ridge
was
cleared
for
there
were
still
ten
miles
to
go
and
the
light
was
waning
jeremy
was
very
much
at
home
in
the
woods
but
the
chill
sombre
depths
that
appeared
and
reappeared
on
either
hand
seemed
to
warn
him
to
be
prepared
he
reached
to
the
saddlebow
undid
the
flap
of
the
pistol
holster
and
made
sure
that
his
weapon
was
loaded
then
put
it
back
reassured
the
footing
was
bad
and
they
had
to
go
more
slowly
for
a
while
then
bob
in
the
lead
came
to
a
more
open
space
where
light
and
ground
alike
favored
better
speed
he
spurred
his
horse
to
a
gallop
and
had
turned
to
call
to
the
others
when
suddenly
the
animal
he
rode
gave
a
snort
of
fear
and
stopped
with
braced
forefeet
bob
caught
off
his
guard
went
over
the
horse
head
with
a
lurch
and
fell
sprawling
on
the
ground
in
front
then
he
gave
a
scream
for
not
two
feet
away
he
saw
the
short
cruel
head
of
a
coiled
rattlesnake
jeremy
riding
close
behind
pulled
up
beside
the
other
horse
and
threw
himself
off
even
as
he
touched
the
ground
a
sharp
whirr
met
his
ear
and
he
saw
the
fat
still
body
and
vibrating
tail
of
the
snake
he
wrenched
the
pistol
from
the
holster
took
the
quickest
aim
of
his
life
and
pulled
the
trigger
after
the
shot
apparently
nothing
had
changed
the
whirr
of
the
rattle
went
on
for
a
second
or
two
then
gradually
subsided
bob
lay
and
still
as
death
jeremy
drew
a
step
closer
and
then
gave
a
choked
cry
of
relief
the
snake
smooth
body
remained
coiled
for
the
spring
its
lithe
forepart
was
thrust
forward
from
the
top
coil
and
the
venemous
blunt
head
but
the
head
was
no
more
jeremy
ball
had
taken
it
short
off
bob
was
unhurt
but
badly
shaken
and
frightened
and
they
followed
the
trail
slowly
through
the
dusk
then
just
as
the
shadows
that
obscured
their
way
were
turning
to
the
deep
dark
of
night
a
small
light
became
visible
straight
ahead
they
pushed
on
and
soon
were
luxuriously
stretched
before
a
log
fire
in
the
curtis
plantation
house
while
robbins
the
overseer
wife
poured
them
a
cup
of
hot
tea
when
bedtime
came
bob
came
over
to
jeremy
and
gave
him
a
long
grip
of
the
hand
but
said
never
a
word
there
was
no
need
of
words
for
the
new
england
boy
knew
that
his
chum
would
never
be
quite
happy
till
he
could
repay
his
act
in
kind
yet
he
could
not
tell
bob
that
the
shooting
of
a
snake
was
but
a
small
return
for
the
gift
of
a
vision
of
one
of
angels
each
felt
himself
the
other
debtor
as
they
got
into
the
great
feather
bed
side
by
side
chapter
xxiv
two
boys
turned
loose
on
a
farm
can
find
enough
interesting
things
to
do
to
fill
a
book
much
larger
than
this
for
me
to
go
into
the
details
of
that
week
visit
to
avon
dale
would
preclude
any
possible
chance
of
your
hearing
the
end
of
this
story
and
there
are
still
many
things
that
need
telling
but
though
no
great
or
grave
adventure
befell
the
two
boys
while
they
stayed
at
the
plantation
you
may
imagine
the
days
they
spent
together
back
of
the
farm
buildings
lay
the
fields
all
up
and
down
the
river
bank
for
miles
and
back
of
the
fields
crowding
close
to
the
edge
of
the
plowed
ground
the
big
trees
of
an
forest
rose
the
great
wild
woods
ran
straight
back
from
the
plantation
for
five
hundred
miles
broken
only
by
rivers
and
the
steep
slopes
of
the
alleghanies
as
yet
hardly
heard
of
by
white
men
giant
oaks
ashes
and
tulip
trees
mingled
with
the
pine
and
hemlock
growth
the
hillsides
where
the
sun
shone
through
were
thick
with
rhododendron
and
laurel
and
all
through
this
sylvan
paradise
the
upper
branches
and
the
underbrush
teemed
with
wild
life
squirrels
partridges
and
occasional
turkeys
offered
frequent
marks
for
the
long
rifles
while
a
thousand
little
song
birds
flitted
constantly
through
the
leaves
jeremy
had
never
seen
such
hunting
in
his
colder
northern
country
the
game
was
bigger
and
more
dangerous
in
new
england
but
never
had
he
found
it
so
plentiful
as
the
boys
were
both
good
marksmen
a
great
rivalry
sprang
up
between
them
they
scorned
any
but
the
hardest
shots
the
bright
eye
of
a
squirrel
above
a
hickory
limb
fifty
yards
off
or
the
downy
form
of
a
wood
pigeon
preening
in
a
tree
top
though
a
good
deal
of
powder
and
lead
was
spent
in
the
process
they
were
shooting
like
old
hunters
by
the
end
of
the
week
the
last
two
days
had
to
be
spent
indoors
for
a
heavy
autumn
rain
that
came
one
night
held
over
persistently
and
drenched
the
valley
with
a
sullen
steady
pour
little
muddy
rivulets
swept
down
across
the
fields
and
joined
the
already
swollen
current
of
the
brandywine
on
the
morning
when
they
started
back
the
river
was
running
high
and
fast
and
yellow
along
the
low
banks
but
a
bright
sun
shone
and
a
fresh
breeze
out
of
the
west
promised
fair
weather
the
horses
were
left
at
the
plantation
they
took
their
guns
and
a
provisions
and
carried
a
long
canoe
down
to
the
shore
it
was
a
dugout
quite
unlike
the
graceful
birch
affairs
that
jeremy
had
seen
among
the
penobscots
but
serviceable
and
seaworthy
enough
job
happy
to
be
on
the
water
once
more
took
the
stern
paddle
bob
knelt
in
the
bow
and
jeremy
squatted
amidships
with
the
blankets
and
guns
with
a
cry
of
farewell
to
the
kindly
folk
on
the
bank
they
shoved
out
and
shot
away
down
the
swift
river
it
was
exciting
work
the
stream
had
overflowed
its
banks
for
many
yards
and
the
brown
water
swirled
in
eddies
among
the
trees
to
keep
the
canoe
in
the
main
channel
required
judgment
and
good
steering
job
proved
equal
to
the
occasion
and
though
with
their
paddling
the
swiftness
of
the
current
gave
the
craft
a
speed
of
over
ten
miles
an
hour
he
brought
her
down
without
mishap
into
a
cove
they
rested
drifting
slowly
across
the
slack
water
this
ca
be
far
from
cantwell
bob
was
saying
when
jeremy
gave
a
startled
exclamation
and
pointed
toward
the
shore
some
fifty
yards
away
a
little
girl
in
a
gray
frock
stood
on
the
bank
her
arms
full
of
golden
rod
and
asters
she
had
not
seen
the
canoe
for
she
was
looking
behind
her
up
the
bank
at
that
instant
there
was
a
crashing
in
the
brush
and
a
big
buck
deer
stepped
out
upon
the
shore
tossing
his
gleaming
antlers
to
which
a
few
shreds
of
summer
velvet
still
clung
he
was
not
twenty
feet
from
the
girl
who
faced
him
perfectly
still
the
flowers
dropping
one
by
one
from
her
apron
it
was
the
rutting
season
and
the
buck
was
in
a
fighting
mood
but
he
was
puzzled
by
this
small
motionless
antagonist
he
hesitated
a
bare
second
before
launching
his
wicked
charge
then
as
he
bellowed
his
defiance
there
came
a
loud
report
the
buck
haunches
wavered
then
straightened
with
a
jerk
as
he
made
a
great
leap
up
the
bank
and
fell
dead
from
jeremy
gun
a
wisp
of
smoke
floated
away
betty
cantwell
sat
down
very
suddenly
and
seemed
about
to
cry
but
as
the
canoe
shot
up
to
the
shore
she
was
smiling
once
more
they
took
her
aboard
and
started
down
stream
again
a
few
hundred
yards
brought
them
to
the
edge
of
the
cantwell
clearing
where
bob
hailed
the
negroes
working
in
the
field
and
gave
them
orders
for
bringing
down
the
dead
buck
at
the
landing
john
cantwell
was
waiting
in
some
anxiety
for
the
sound
of
jeremy
shot
had
reached
him
at
the
house
bob
told
the
story
somewhat
to
jeremy
embarrassment
for
nothing
was
spared
in
the
telling
the
quaker
thanked
him
with
great
earnestness
and
reproved
his
daughter
gently
for
straying
beyond
the
plantation
after
another
of
those
famous
dinners
job
and
the
boys
returned
to
their
craft
for
there
were
many
miles
to
make
before
night
as
jeremy
took
up
the
bow
paddle
he
waved
to
betty
on
the
bank
and
thrilled
with
happiness
at
the
shy
smile
she
gave
him
once
again
they
were
in
the
current
shooting
downstream
toward
tidewater
it
was
when
they
crossed
the
brandywine
bar
and
paddled
past
the
docks
of
wilmington
outside
in
the
delaware
there
was
a
choppy
sea
that
made
their
progress
slower
and
the
sun
had
set
when
the
slim
little
craft
ran
in
for
the
beach
above
new
castle
the
voyagers
shouldered
their
packs
and
made
their
way
up
the
high
street
to
the
brick
house
when
the
greetings
were
over
and
the
boys
were
changing
their
clothes
before
coming
down
for
supper
clarke
curtis
entered
their
room
lads
he
said
i
advise
you
to
go
early
to
bed
tonight
you
need
a
long
rest
for
in
the
morning
you
start
overland
for
new
york
at
exclamation
of
surprise
he
went
on
to
explain
that
the
had
weighed
anchor
two
days
before
for
that
port
and
as
there
was
no
other
ship
leaving
the
delaware
soon
he
wished
the
boys
to
board
her
at
new
york
for
the
voyage
to
new
england
both
youngsters
were
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
an
early
start
bob
who
had
been
promised
that
he
could
accompany
his
chum
was
hilarious
over
the
news
while
jeremy
was
too
happy
to
speak
later
as
they
were
packing
their
belongings
for
the
trip
job
howland
came
in
he
too
looked
excited
jeremy
boy
he
said
i
have
liked
to
go
north
with
you
but
something
else
has
come
my
way
curtis
bought
a
new
schooner
the
last
week
and
she
being
fitted
out
now
for
a
coast
trader
he
offered
me
the
chance
to
command
her
three
cheers
shouted
bob
then
new
castle
will
be
your
home
port
and
i
see
you
after
every
voyage
the
three
comrades
chatted
of
their
prospects
a
while
and
shortly
went
to
bed
chapter
xxv
the
boys
and
their
luggage
were
on
their
way
to
wilmington
in
the
family
chaise
before
dawn
and
it
was
scarce
seven
when
they
bade
farewell
to
the
old
colored
and
clambered
aboard
the
coach
that
connected
in
philadelphia
with
the
mail
coach
for
new
york
the
coaches
of
that
day
were
cumbersome
affairs
huge
of
wheel
and
with
ridiculously
small
bodies
slung
on
wide
strips
of
bull
hide
which
served
for
springs
the
driver
box
was
high
above
the
forward
running
gear
there
were
as
yet
no
seats
on
top
such
as
were
developed
in
the
later
days
of
fast
service
in
one
of
these
rumbling
swaying
conveyances
the
boys
rode
the
thirty
miles
to
philadelphia
crossing
the
schuylkill
at
gray
ferry
about
noon
they
had
barely
time
for
a
bite
of
lunch
in
the
white
horse
tavern
before
the
horn
was
blown
outside
and
they
hurried
to
take
their
places
in
the
coach
along
the
cobbled
streets
of
the
bustling
town
they
rumbled
for
a
few
moments
then
out
upon
the
smooth
dirt
surface
of
the
york
road
where
the
four
good
horses
were
put
to
a
gallop
the
delaware
opposite
trenton
was
reached
by
six
and
there
the
passengers
left
the
coach
and
were
carried
across
on
a
little
ferry
boat
rowed
by
an
old
man
and
his
two
sons
they
spent
the
night
at
an
inn
and
next
morning
early
boarded
another
coach
bound
northeast
over
the
sparsely
settled
hills
of
new
jersey
the
road
was
narrow
and
bad
in
places
slackening
their
speed
twice
the
horses
were
changed
in
little
hamlets
along
the
way
in
the
late
afternoon
they
crossed
the
marshy
flats
beyond
newark
and
just
after
dusk
emerged
on
the
jersey
side
of
the
hudson
a
few
lights
glimmered
from
the
low
manhattan
shore
the
quaint
village
which
was
destined
to
grow
in
two
hundred
years
to
be
the
greatest
city
in
the
world
lay
quiet
in
the
gathering
dark
the
ferry
was
just
pulling
out
from
shore
but
at
the
sound
of
the
coach
horn
it
swung
back
into
its
slip
and
waited
for
the
passengers
to
board
a
gruff
hollander
by
the
name
of
peter
houter
was
the
ferryman
he
stood
at
the
clumsy
while
four
stout
rowers
manned
the
oars
of
his
wide
craft
approaching
the
steersman
bob
asked
where
in
the
town
he
would
be
likely
to
find
the
captain
of
a
merchantman
then
taking
cargo
in
the
port
the
dutchman
named
two
taverns
at
which
visiting
seafaring
men
could
commonly
be
found
one
was
the
three
whales
and
the
other
the
bull
and
fish
landing
on
the
manhattan
shore
the
boys
shouldered
their
luggage
and
trudged
by
lanes
across
the
island
to
the
east
river
as
they
advanced
along
the
jeremy
distinguished
among
the
houses
a
small
inn
before
which
a
great
sign
swung
in
the
wind
by
the
light
which
flickered
through
the
windows
they
could
make
out
three
dark
monsters
painted
upon
the
board
a
white
tree
apparently
growing
from
the
head
of
each
the
three
whales
laughed
jeremy
and
every
one
let
go
in
it
was
an
and
dingy
room
that
they
entered
a
score
of
men
in
rough
sailor
clothes
lounged
at
the
tables
or
lolled
at
the
bar
two
pierced
tin
lanterns
shed
a
faint
smoky
light
over
the
scene
bob
waited
by
their
baggage
at
the
door
while
jeremy
made
his
way
from
one
group
to
another
inquiring
for
captain
ghent
of
the
several
of
the
mariners
nodded
at
mention
of
the
ship
but
none
could
give
him
word
of
the
skipper
whereabouts
as
he
was
turning
to
go
out
he
noticed
a
man
drinking
alone
at
a
table
in
the
darkest
corner
his
eyes
were
fixed
moodily
on
his
glass
and
he
did
not
look
up
jeremy
shivered
took
a
step
nearer
and
almost
cried
out
for
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
livid
diagonal
scar
cutting
across
the
nose
from
eyebrow
to
chin
it
was
such
a
scar
as
could
belong
to
only
one
man
on
earth
jeremy
retreated
to
a
darker
part
of
the
room
and
watched
till
the
man
lifted
his
head
it
was
pharaoh
daggs
and
none
other
a
moment
later
the
boy
had
hurried
to
bob
outside
and
told
him
his
news
if
we
can
find
ghent
said
bob
he
will
be
able
to
summon
soldiers
and
have
him
placed
under
arrest
they
hastened
along
the
river
front
for
a
hundred
yards
or
more
and
came
to
the
bull
and
fish
a
man
in
a
blue
cloth
coat
was
standing
by
the
door
looking
up
and
down
the
street
he
gave
a
hail
of
greeting
as
they
came
up
it
was
captain
ghent
i
was
just
going
down
to
the
three
whales
thinking
you
might
have
stopped
there
he
said
bob
told
him
their
news
and
the
skipper
face
grew
grave
better
leave
the
bags
here
for
the
present
he
suggested
and
then
after
a
moment
quiet
talk
with
the
landlord
he
led
the
way
toward
the
other
tavern
on
the
way
he
stopped
a
soldier
who
was
patrolling
the
dock
after
a
word
or
two
had
been
exchanged
the
soldier
fell
in
beside
them
and
just
as
they
reached
the
inn
door
two
more
hurried
up
come
in
with
me
jeremy
and
point
out
the
man
said
captain
ghent
the
lad
heart
beat
like
a
triphammer
as
he
entered
the
tavern
once
more
a
silence
fell
on
the
room
when
the
three
soldiers
were
observed
jeremy
crossed
toward
the
dark
corner
the
table
was
empty
he
looked
quickly
about
at
the
faces
of
the
drinkers
but
daggs
was
not
there
he
gone
he
said
in
a
disappointed
voice
the
innkeeper
came
forward
wiping
his
hands
on
his
apron
that
fellow
with
the
scar
he
said
he
went
out
of
here
some
five
minutes
ago
which
way
asked
ghent
but
no
one
in
the
room
could
say
they
passed
out
again
and
ghent
smiled
reassuringly
at
the
boys
well
he
said
like
as
not
he
never
cross
our
path
again
so
only
one
rogue
the
more
unhung
jeremy
failed
to
find
much
comfort
in
this
philosophy
but
said
no
more
and
soon
found
himself
snugly
on
board
the
big
merchantman
where
his
bunk
and
bob
were
already
made
up
and
awaiting
them
it
was
good
to
hear
the
creak
of
timbers
and
feel
the
rocking
of
the
tide
once
more
jeremy
lay
long
awake
that
night
thinking
of
many
things
at
last
he
was
on
the
final
lap
of
his
journey
the
cargo
would
be
stowed
within
a
day
or
two
and
she
would
start
with
him
toward
home
he
thought
with
a
quiver
of
happiness
of
the
reunion
with
his
father
had
he
quite
given
up
hope
for
his
boy
jeremy
had
heard
of
such
a
shock
of
joy
being
fatal
he
must
be
careful
he
thought
of
the
evil
face
of
the
buccaneer
what
was
daggs
doing
in
new
york
just
then
there
was
a
faint
sound
as
of
creaking
cordage
from
beyond
the
side
jeremy
bunk
was
near
the
open
port
and
by
leaning
over
a
little
he
could
see
the
river
barely
a
boat
length
away
in
the
dark
a
craft
was
slipping
past
on
the
outgoing
tide
with
not
so
much
as
a
showing
illustration
chapter
xxvi
it
was
on
the
second
morning
after
the
boys
had
reached
new
york
that
the
went
down
the
harbor
her
canvas
drawing
merrily
in
the
spanking
breeze
of
dawn
the
intervening
day
had
been
spent
at
the
where
dutch
longshoremen
were
stoutly
hustling
bales
and
boxes
of
merchandise
into
the
hold
jeremy
had
watched
the
passers
along
the
river
front
narrowly
though
he
could
not
help
having
a
feeling
that
pharaoh
daggs
was
gone
the
fancy
would
not
leave
his
mind
that
there
was
some
connection
between
the
vanished
pirate
and
the
dark
vessel
he
had
seen
stealing
out
on
the
night
tide
a
strong
southwest
wind
followed
them
all
day
as
the
ran
past
the
low
long
island
shore
and
that
night
though
captain
ghent
gave
orders
to
shorten
sail
the
ship
still
plunged
ahead
with
unchecked
speed
they
cleared
the
nantucket
shoals
next
day
and
saw
all
through
the
afternoon
the
sun
glint
on
the
lonely
white
dunes
of
cape
cod
two
more
bright
days
of
breeze
succeeded
and
they
were
working
up
outside
the
fringe
of
islands
large
and
small
that
dot
the
coast
of
maine
jeremy
was
too
excited
even
to
eat
he
stayed
constantly
by
the
man
at
the
helm
and
was
often
joined
there
by
bob
and
the
captain
as
they
drew
nearer
to
the
penobscot
bay
coast
in
the
morning
they
dropped
anchor
in
fifteen
fathoms
to
leeward
of
a
island
jeremy
had
a
dim
recollection
of
having
seen
it
from
the
peak
above
his
father
shack
his
heart
beat
high
at
the
thought
that
tomorrow
might
bring
them
to
the
place
they
sought
and
it
was
many
hours
before
he
went
to
sleep
at
last
the
morning
came
cloudless
and
bright
with
a
little
south
breeze
stirring
before
the
sun
was
fairly
clear
of
the
sea
the
anchor
had
been
catted
and
the
was
moving
gracefully
northeastward
under
snowy
topsails
they
cleared
a
wide
channel
between
two
islands
and
jeremy
forward
with
the
lookout
gave
a
mighty
shout
that
brought
his
chum
to
his
side
on
the
run
there
to
the
east
across
a
dozen
miles
of
sea
loomed
a
gray
peak
round
and
smooth
as
an
inverted
bowl
it
the
island
cried
jeremy
and
captain
ghent
turning
to
the
mate
gave
a
joyful
order
to
get
more
sail
on
the
ship
about
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
the
came
into
the
wind
and
her
anchor
went
down
with
a
roar
and
a
splash
not
three
cables
lengths
from
the
spot
in
the
northern
bay
where
jeremy
and
his
father
had
first
landed
their
flock
of
sheep
on
the
gray
slope
above
the
shore
the
boys
could
see
the
low
black
cabin
silent
and
apparently
tenantless
behind
it
was
the
stout
stockade
of
the
also
deserted
and
above
the
thin
grass
and
gray
grim
ledges
climbed
toward
the
wooded
crest
of
the
hill
jeremy
face
fell
they
must
have
gone
he
said
but
bob
standing
by
the
rail
as
they
waited
for
the
jollyboat
to
be
lowered
pointed
excitedly
toward
the
rocky
westward
shoulder
of
the
island
look
there
he
cried
three
or
four
white
dots
were
moving
slowly
along
the
face
of
the
hill
sheep
said
jeremy
taking
heart
they
not
have
left
the
sheep
unless
but
the
boat
was
ready
below
the
side
and
the
captain
and
the
two
boys
tumbled
quickly
in
five
minutes
later
the
four
stout
rowers
sent
the
bow
far
up
the
sand
with
a
final
heave
on
the
oars
they
jumped
out
and
hastened
up
the
hill
there
was
still
no
sign
of
life
about
the
cabin
but
as
they
drew
near
a
sudden
sharp
racket
startled
them
and
around
the
corner
of
the
tore
a
big
collie
dog
barking
excitedly
he
hesitated
a
bare
instant
then
jumped
straight
at
jeremy
with
a
whine
of
frantic
welcome
jock
lad
cried
the
boy
joyfully
burying
his
face
in
the
sable
ruff
of
the
dog
neck
in
response
to
his
voice
the
door
of
the
cabin
was
thrown
open
and
a
tall
youth
of
nineteen
stepped
out
hesitating
as
he
saw
the
group
below
jeremy
shook
off
the
collie
and
ran
forward
you
know
me
tom
he
laughed
i
your
brother
back
from
the
pirates
the
amazed
look
on
the
other
face
slowly
gave
place
to
one
of
joy
as
he
gripped
the
youngster
shoulders
and
looked
long
into
his
eyes
know
ye
he
said
at
length
with
a
break
in
his
voice
certain
i
know
ye
though
ye
grown
half
a
foot
it
seems
but
wait
we
must
tell
father
he
in
bed
hurt
tom
turned
to
the
door
again
here
father
he
called
breathlessly
here
jeremy
home
safe
and
sound
he
seized
his
brother
hand
and
led
him
into
the
cabin
in
the
at
the
back
of
the
room
the
lad
saw
a
rough
bed
and
above
the
homespun
blankets
amos
swan
bearded
face
he
sprang
toward
him
and
flung
himself
down
by
the
bunk
his
head
against
his
father
breast
he
felt
strong
fingers
that
trembled
a
little
as
they
gripped
his
arm
there
was
no
word
said
chapter
xxvii
it
was
the
savory
smell
of
cooking
hominy
and
the
sizzle
of
broiling
fish
that
woke
jeremy
next
morning
he
drew
a
breath
of
pure
ecstasy
rolled
over
and
began
pummelling
the
inert
form
of
bob
who
had
shared
his
blanket
on
an
improvised
bed
in
the
cabin
the
delaware
boy
opened
an
eye
closed
it
again
with
carefully
assumed
drowsiness
and
the
next
instant
leaped
like
a
joyful
wildcat
on
his
tormentor
there
was
a
beautiful
tussle
that
was
only
broken
off
by
tom
announcement
of
breakfast
opposite
the
stone
fireplace
was
a
table
of
hewn
planks
at
which
bob
with
jeremy
tom
and
their
father
were
soon
seated
the
latter
had
bruised
his
knee
several
days
before
but
was
now
sufficiently
recovered
to
walk
about
with
the
aid
of
a
stick
father
said
jeremy
between
mouthfuls
i
want
to
see
that
cove
again
where
the
pirates
landed
if
we
may
take
the
bob
and
go
across
the
island
after
we
bade
to
captain
ghent
ay
lad
amos
swan
replied
you
find
the
cove
just
as
they
left
it
an
i
mistake
not
the
place
where
their
fire
was
is
still
black
upon
the
beach
and
the
are
lying
up
among
the
driftwood
was
there
we
found
them
on
the
second
day
ah
jeremy
lad
little
we
thought
then
we
see
you
back
safe
and
strong
and
that
so
soon
the
white
frost
of
the
november
morning
was
still
gleaming
on
the
grass
when
the
two
boys
went
out
against
the
cloudless
sky
the
spires
of
the
dark
fir
trees
were
cut
in
clean
silhouette
from
the
lying
off
shore
came
the
creak
of
blocks
and
sheaves
as
the
yards
were
trimmed
and
soon
her
anchor
catted
home
she
filled
gracefully
away
to
the
northward
while
the
captain
waved
a
cheery
farewell
from
the
poop
he
was
bound
up
the
coast
for
halifax
and
was
to
pick
bob
up
on
his
return
voyage
a
month
later
when
they
had
watched
the
ship
white
sails
disappear
behind
the
eastern
headland
the
boys
started
up
the
hill
behind
the
cabin
they
carried
a
lunch
of
bread
and
dried
fish
in
a
leather
pouch
and
across
jeremy
shoulder
was
one
of
his
father
guns
bob
was
armed
with
the
pistol
from
stede
bonnet
arsenal
it
was
a
glorious
morning
for
a
trip
of
exploration
and
the
hearts
of
both
lads
were
high
as
they
clambered
out
on
the
warm
bare
rock
that
crowned
the
island
is
it
just
as
fine
as
i
told
you
jeremy
cried
look
those
blue
mountains
yonder
must
be
twenty
leagues
away
and
you
can
hardly
count
the
islands
in
this
great
bay
off
there
to
the
south
is
where
i
saw
the
for
the
first
time
just
a
speck
on
the
sea
she
was
bob
who
had
never
seen
the
view
from
a
really
high
hill
before
stood
as
he
looked
about
him
suddenly
he
grasped
jeremy
arm
see
he
exclaimed
down
there
is
that
smoke
he
was
pointing
toward
the
low
swampy
region
in
the
southwestern
part
of
the
island
jeremy
watched
intently
but
there
was
nothing
to
disturb
the
morning
calm
of
sky
and
shore
that
queer
bob
said
at
last
with
a
puzzled
look
i
could
take
an
oath
i
saw
just
the
faintest
wisp
of
smoke
over
there
but
i
must
have
been
mistaken
well
laughed
jeremy
we
soon
make
sure
for
that
not
far
from
where
we
going
they
scrambled
down
and
following
the
ridge
turned
south
toward
the
lower
bay
at
about
the
point
where
jeremy
had
been
discovered
by
dave
herriot
and
the
pirate
captain
dodging
through
the
tangle
of
undergrowth
and
driftwood
they
soon
emerged
on
the
loose
sand
above
the
beach
as
amos
swan
had
said
the
rains
had
not
yet
washed
away
the
black
embers
of
the
great
bonfire
and
near
by
lay
a
barrel
with
staves
caved
in
looking
at
the
scene
jeremy
almost
fancied
he
could
hear
again
the
wild
chorus
of
that
drunken
crew
most
of
whom
had
now
gone
to
their
last
accounting
what
say
we
walk
down
the
shore
a
way
suggested
bob
there
might
be
a
duck
or
two
in
that
reedy
cove
below
here
and
jeremy
glad
to
quit
the
place
led
off
briskly
westward
along
the
sand
soon
they
came
to
the
entrance
of
a
narrow
winding
that
ran
back
till
it
was
hidden
from
sight
in
the
tall
reeds
just
as
they
reached
the
place
a
large
flock
of
sandpeeps
flew
over
with
soft
whistling
and
lighting
on
the
beach
scurried
along
in
a
dense
company
offering
an
easy
target
bob
who
was
carrying
the
gun
brought
it
quickly
to
his
shoulder
and
was
about
to
fire
when
jeremy
stopped
him
with
a
low
bob
turned
following
the
direction
of
jeremy
outstretched
arm
and
for
a
second
both
boys
stood
as
if
petrified
gazing
up
the
toward
the
interior
of
the
island
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
above
the
reeds
which
grew
in
rank
profusion
to
a
man
height
or
higher
they
saw
a
pair
of
slender
masts
canted
far
over
a
ship
whispered
bob
deserted
though
most
likely
no
jeremy
answered
i
do
think
it
her
cordage
would
have
slacked
off
more
and
she
would
look
so
trim
bob
was
it
near
here
you
saw
that
smoke
jiminy
said
bob
so
it
was
right
over
in
the
marsh
close
to
those
spars
it
some
vessel
that
put
in
here
to
careen
wonder
where
her
crew
can
be
that
what
looks
so
queer
to
me
the
other
boy
replied
keeping
out
of
sight
mighty
careful
men
from
any
honest
ship
would
have
been
all
over
the
island
the
first
day
ashore
i
do
like
the
look
of
it
let
get
back
and
tell
father
maybe
we
can
find
out
who
it
is
afterwards
bob
argued
at
first
for
an
immediate
reconnaissance
but
when
jeremy
pointed
out
the
fact
that
if
the
strangers
were
undesirable
they
would
surely
have
a
guard
hidden
in
the
reeds
up
the
creek
he
accepted
the
more
discreet
plan
they
made
their
way
quietly
but
with
as
much
haste
as
possible
back
along
the
shore
past
the
remnant
of
the
fire
and
up
the
hill
into
the
thick
woods
just
as
they
crossed
the
ridge
and
began
to
see
the
glint
of
the
northern
inlet
through
the
trees
jeremy
paused
with
a
sudden
exclamation
here
the
spring
he
said
and
look
at
the
sign
above
it
i
never
saw
that
before
for
it
was
dark
when
i
was
up
here
i
almost
fell
in
the
spring
itself
was
nearly
invisible
to
one
coming
from
this
direction
but
stuck
in
the
fork
of
a
tree
beside
it
was
a
weathered
old
piece
of
ship
planking
on
which
had
been
rudely
cut
the
single
word
watter
some
captain
who
used
to
fill
his
casks
here
must
have
put
it
up
so
that
the
spring
would
be
easier
to
find
bob
suggested
but
jeremy
striding
ahead
was
thinking
hard
and
did
not
answer
amos
swan
heard
their
news
with
a
grave
face
no
ship
but
the
had
touched
at
the
island
for
several
months
to
his
knowledge
he
said
he
agreed
with
the
boys
that
the
secrecy
of
the
thing
looked
suspicious
when
tom
came
in
for
the
noon
meal
his
father
told
him
of
the
discovery
and
they
both
decided
to
bring
the
sheep
in
at
once
and
make
preparations
for
possible
trouble
tom
armed
and
accompanied
by
the
boys
set
out
soon
after
dinner
for
the
western
end
of
the
island
two
miles
from
the
shack
it
was
there
that
the
flock
was
accustomed
to
graze
shepherded
by
the
wise
dog
jock
their
way
led
along
the
rocky
northern
slope
where
the
sheep
had
already
worn
paths
among
the
scrubby
grass
and
juniper
patches
then
up
across
a
steep
knoll
and
through
a
belt
of
fir
and
hemlock
when
at
length
they
came
out
from
among
the
trees
the
pasture
lay
before
them
there
in
a
hollow
a
hundred
yards
away
the
flock
was
huddled
jock
became
aware
of
their
approach
at
that
instant
and
lifted
his
head
in
a
short
choking
bark
he
started
toward
them
but
before
he
had
taken
a
dozen
steps
they
could
see
that
he
was
limping
painfully
running
forward
jeremy
knelt
beside
the
big
collie
then
turned
with
a
movement
of
sudden
dismay
and
called
to
his
comrades
he
had
seen
the
broad
splotch
of
vivid
red
stained
the
dog
white
breast
examination
showed
a
deep
clean
cut
in
the
fur
of
the
neck
from
which
the
blood
still
flowed
sluggishly
but
in
spite
of
his
weakness
and
the
pain
he
evidently
suffered
jock
could
hardly
wait
to
lead
his
masters
back
to
the
flock
hurrying
on
with
him
they
crossed
a
little
rise
of
ground
and
came
upon
the
sheep
which
were
crowded
close
to
one
another
panting
in
abject
terror
illustration
jock
yes
and
that
all
tom
said
there
are
two
of
them
missing
jock
had
limped
on
some
twenty
yards
further
and
now
stood
beside
a
juniper
bush
shivering
with
eagerness
following
him
thither
the
boys
found
him
sniffing
at
a
patch
of
grass
the
ground
for
several
feet
around
was
cut
up
as
if
in
some
sort
of
struggle
a
few
shreds
of
bloody
wool
caught
in
the
junipers
told
their
own
story
a
man
probably
several
men
had
been
on
the
spot
not
two
hours
before
and
had
killed
two
of
the
sheep
they
had
not
succeeded
in
this
without
a
fight
in
which
the
gallant
old
dog
had
been
stabbed
with
a
dirk
or
some
other
sharp
weapon
bob
scouting
onward
a
short
distance
found
the
deep
of
two
men
in
a
wet
place
between
some
rocks
they
were
headed
straight
toward
the
reedy
swamp
where
the
boys
had
seen
the
of
the
strange
vessel
the
crew
whoever
they
might
be
had
decided
to
leave
no
further
doubt
of
their
intentions
they
had
opened
hostilities
and
to
them
had
fallen
first
blood
with
serious
faces
and
guns
held
ready
for
an
attack
the
three
lads
turned
toward
home
driving
the
scared
flock
before
them
old
jock
stiff
and
limping
from
his
wound
brought
up
the
rear
they
reached
the
inlet
at
last
but
it
was
sunset
when
the
last
sheep
was
inside
the
stockade
and
the
cabin
door
was
barred
that
night
the
wind
changed
and
the
cold
gray
blanket
of
a
penobscot
bay
fog
shut
down
over
the
island
chapter
xxviii
the
fog
held
for
two
days
on
the
third
morning
jeremy
on
his
knees
by
the
hearth
fire
was
squinting
down
the
bright
barrel
of
a
flintlock
he
had
been
quiet
for
a
long
time
bob
felt
the
tenseness
of
the
situation
himself
but
he
could
not
understand
the
other
absolute
silence
he
scowled
as
he
sat
on
the
floor
and
savagely
drove
a
into
the
cracks
between
the
hewn
planks
at
length
a
low
whistle
from
jeremy
caused
him
to
pause
and
look
up
quickly
what
is
it
he
asked
a
look
of
excitement
was
growing
in
jeremy
face
say
bob
he
exclaimed
after
a
second
or
two
i
just
remembered
something
that
i
been
trying
to
bring
to
mind
ever
since
we
crossed
the
island
you
know
the
sign
we
saw
up
by
the
spring
well
somewhere
once
before
i
knew
i
seen
the
word
spelled
that
way
so
have
you
do
you
remember
bob
shook
his
head
slowly
then
a
look
of
comprehending
wonder
came
into
his
eyes
yes
he
cried
it
was
on
that
old
chart
in
pharaoh
chest
right
said
jeremy
and
now
that
i
think
about
it
i
believe
this
is
the
very
island
let
see
the
bay
was
shaped
this
way
he
had
seized
a
charred
stick
from
the
hearth
and
was
drawing
on
the
floor
two
narrow
points
with
quite
a
stretch
of
water
inside
a
rounded
cove
up
here
and
a
cove
over
here
and
the
anchor
was
drawn
wait
a
minute
right
here
why
bob
look
here
that
the
same
rounded
cove
with
the
beach
where
the
sloop
anchored
that
night
they
got
me
bob
could
hardly
contain
himself
i
remember
he
said
and
the
dot
with
the
word
was
one
and
a
half
northeast
of
the
bay
let
see
the
bay
itself
was
about
four
joints
long
was
it
or
a
little
over
anyhow
that
would
put
the
spring
about
here
allowing
for
our
not
being
able
to
remember
exactly
the
shape
of
the
bay
jeremy
put
in
that
just
where
the
spring
should
be
bob
this
is
the
island
and
now
that
between
the
two
straight
lines
two
northwest
of
the
it
was
just
about
here
he
marked
the
spot
on
the
floor
with
his
stick
now
we
got
it
all
down
and
if
that
shows
where
the
treasure
is
jeremy
paused
and
looked
at
bob
his
eyes
shining
where
would
that
be
up
on
the
hill
somewhere
asked
bob
breathlessly
about
of
a
mile
south
of
the
spring
right
on
the
ridge
jeremy
answered
when
shall
we
start
bob
asked
his
voice
husky
with
excitement
wait
a
bit
counselled
jeremy
we
dare
tell
father
or
tom
for
they
think
it
just
a
chase
and
we
have
to
promise
not
to
leave
the
cabin
you
know
it
an
improbable
sort
of
yarn
besides
we
better
go
careful
do
you
know
who
i
think
is
at
the
head
of
that
crew
over
in
the
creek
who
whispered
bob
jeremy
face
was
pale
as
he
leaned
close
pharaoh
daggs
he
said
the
name
beneath
his
breath
almost
as
if
he
feared
that
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
might
hear
him
and
now
for
the
first
time
he
told
bob
of
the
schooner
that
had
slipped
past
in
the
dark
that
night
in
the
east
river
you
right
jeremy
bob
agreed
he
lose
no
time
getting
up
here
if
he
could
find
a
craft
to
carry
him
you
do
suppose
they
found
brig
treasure
yet
do
you
he
added
in
dismay
they
ca
have
reached
here
more
than
a
day
before
us
jeremy
replied
and
if
they
have
it
already
aboard
they
wo
be
able
to
do
anything
while
this
fog
holds
if
it
should
lift
tomorrow
have
a
chance
to
scout
around
up
there
but
do
say
a
word
to
father
that
night
the
boys
slept
little
for
both
were
in
a
fever
of
expectation
they
were
disappointed
in
the
morning
to
see
the
solid
wall
of
fog
still
surrounding
the
cabin
but
jeremy
sniffing
the
air
like
the
true
woodsman
that
he
was
announced
that
there
would
be
a
change
of
weather
before
night
and
set
about
rubbing
the
barrel
of
the
flintlock
till
it
gleamed
the
day
dragged
slowly
by
at
last
about
three
in
the
afternoon
a
slight
wind
from
the
northeast
sprang
up
and
the
wreaths
of
vapor
began
to
drift
away
seaward
luckily
for
the
boys
plans
both
tom
and
his
father
were
inside
the
when
bob
took
the
pistols
powder
and
shot
down
from
the
wall
and
with
jeremy
went
quietly
forth
before
the
mist
had
wholly
cleared
they
were
well
into
the
woods
climbing
toward
the
summit
of
the
ridge
each
kept
a
careful
watch
about
for
they
feared
the
possibility
that
a
guard
might
have
been
set
to
observe
movements
at
the
cabin
they
reached
the
top
without
incident
however
and
turned
westward
along
the
watershed
they
were
increasingly
careful
now
for
if
the
pirates
were
dependent
on
the
spring
for
their
water
some
of
them
might
pass
close
by
at
any
moment
bob
who
was
almost
as
expert
a
hunter
as
jeremy
followed
noiselessly
in
the
track
of
the
new
england
boy
moving
like
a
shadow
from
tree
to
tree
so
they
progressed
for
fifteen
minutes
or
more
then
jeremy
paused
and
beckoned
to
bob
whispering
that
they
should
separate
a
short
distance
so
as
to
cover
a
wider
territory
in
their
search
they
went
on
bob
on
the
north
slope
jeremy
on
the
south
moving
cautiously
and
examining
every
rock
and
tree
for
some
blaze
that
might
indicate
the
whereabouts
of
the
treasure
more
minutes
passed
the
sun
was
already
low
and
jeremy
began
to
think
about
turning
toward
home
just
then
he
came
to
the
brink
of
a
narrow
chasm
in
the
ledge
hardly
more
than
a
cleft
it
was
three
or
four
feet
wide
at
its
widest
part
and
extending
deep
down
between
the
walls
of
rock
he
was
about
to
jump
over
and
proceed
when
his
eye
caught
a
momentary
gleam
in
the
obscurity
at
the
bottom
of
the
crevice
he
peered
downward
for
a
second
then
stood
erect
waving
to
bob
with
both
arms
the
other
boy
caught
his
signal
and
came
rapidly
through
the
trees
to
the
spot
hurrying
faster
as
he
saw
the
excitement
in
jeremy
face
what
what
have
you
found
he
gasped
under
his
breath
jeremy
was
already
wriggling
his
way
down
between
the
smooth
rock
walls
bracing
himself
with
back
and
knees
within
a
few
seconds
he
had
reached
the
bottom
some
ten
feet
below
it
was
a
sloping
uneven
floor
of
earth
lighted
dimly
from
above
and
from
the
south
where
the
ledge
shelved
off
down
the
hillside
the
dirt
was
black
and
damp
undisturbed
for
years
save
by
the
feeble
pushing
of
some
pale
seedling
plant
jeremy
groped
aimlessly
at
first
then
as
his
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
peered
closely
into
the
crevices
along
either
side
bob
leaned
over
the
edge
pointing
back
and
to
the
left
he
whispered
jeremy
turned
as
directed
felt
along
the
earth
and
finally
clutched
at
something
that
seemed
to
glitter
with
a
yellow
light
he
turned
his
face
upward
and
bob
read
utter
disappointment
in
his
eyes
the
gleaming
something
which
he
held
aloft
was
nothing
but
a
bit
of
discolored
mica
that
had
reflected
the
faint
light
bob
almost
groaned
aloud
as
he
looked
at
it
then
he
took
off
his
belt
and
passed
an
end
of
it
down
for
jeremy
to
climb
up
by
the
latter
took
hold
and
was
commencing
the
ascent
when
his
moccasined
foot
slipped
on
a
low
arching
hump
in
the
damp
earth
he
went
down
on
one
knee
and
as
it
struck
the
ground
there
was
a
faint
hollow
thud
astonished
the
boy
remained
in
a
kneeling
posture
and
felt
about
beneath
him
with
his
hands
what
is
it
whispered
bob
jeremy
stood
erect
again
some
kind
of
old
slippery
wet
wood
he
answered
it
feels
like
like
a
barrel
i
coming
down
said
the
delaware
boy
and
casting
a
cautious
look
around
he
descended
into
the
depths
of
the
crevice
with
their
hands
and
both
boys
went
to
work
feverishly
to
unearth
the
wooden
object
a
few
moments
of
breathless
labor
laid
bare
the
side
and
part
of
one
end
of
a
oaken
keg
now
maybe
we
can
lift
it
out
said
jeremy
and
taking
a
strong
grip
of
the
edge
they
heaved
mightily
together
it
stirred
a
bare
fraction
of
an
inch
in
its
bed
again
panted
jeremy
and
they
made
another
desperate
try
it
was
of
no
avail
the
keg
seemed
to
weigh
hundreds
of
pounds
mopping
his
forehead
with
his
sleeve
bob
stood
up
and
looked
his
companion
in
the
face
well
he
grinned
the
heavier
the
better
right
jeremy
agreed
but
how
we
get
it
home
we
do
dare
chop
it
open
too
much
noise
or
set
fire
to
it
for
they
see
the
smoke
besides
it
too
damp
to
burn
here
i
see
what
in
it
yet
he
crouched
at
the
end
of
the
barrel
whetted
his
on
his
palm
a
few
times
and
began
to
cut
swiftly
at
a
crack
between
two
staves
gradually
the
blade
worked
into
the
wood
opening
a
long
narrow
slot
as
jeremy
whittled
away
first
at
one
side
then
at
the
other
from
time
to
time
either
he
or
bob
would
stoop
trembling
with
excitement
to
peer
through
the
crack
but
it
was
inside
the
barrel
jeremy
kept
at
his
task
without
rest
and
as
his
knife
had
more
play
the
shavings
he
cut
from
the
sides
of
the
opening
grew
thicker
and
thicker
first
he
then
bob
would
try
every
few
seconds
to
thrust
a
fist
through
the
widening
hole
at
length
bob
hand
which
was
a
trifle
smaller
than
jeremy
squeezed
through
there
was
a
breathless
instant
while
he
groped
within
the
keg
and
then
with
a
struggle
he
pulled
his
hand
forth
in
his
fingers
he
clutched
a
broad
yellow
disc
gold
they
gasped
the
word
together
bob
face
was
it
full
of
full
of
pieces
like
this
he
whispered
right
up
to
within
four
inches
of
the
top
they
bent
over
the
huge
gold
coin
the
queer
characters
of
the
inscription
cut
in
deep
relief
were
strange
to
both
boys
jeremy
had
seen
spanish
doubloons
and
the
great
double
of
portugal
but
never
such
a
piece
as
this
it
was
nearly
two
inches
across
and
thick
and
heavy
in
proportion
one
after
another
bob
drew
out
dozens
of
the
shining
coins
and
they
filled
their
pockets
with
them
till
they
felt
weighted
down
at
length
jeremy
looking
up
was
startled
to
see
that
the
sun
had
set
and
darkness
was
rapidly
settling
over
the
island
they
threw
dirt
over
the
barrel
then
with
all
possible
speed
clambered
forth
and
taking
up
their
guns
made
their
way
home
as
quietly
as
they
had
come
chapter
xxix
no
lad
the
risk
is
too
great
ye
be
in
worse
plight
than
before
if
they
caught
ye
and
with
a
score
of
the
ruffians
searching
the
island
over
ye
run
too
long
a
chance
better
be
satisfied
with
what
here
and
stay
where
we
can
at
least
defend
ourselves
amos
swan
was
speaking
on
the
deal
table
before
him
a
heap
of
great
goldpieces
gleamed
in
the
firelight
while
seated
around
the
board
were
his
two
sons
and
bob
it
was
tom
who
answered
true
enough
father
he
said
and
yet
this
gold
is
ours
we
own
the
island
by
the
governor
grant
if
we
sit
idle
the
pirates
will
surely
find
the
treasure
and
make
off
with
it
but
if
we
go
up
there
at
night
as
jeremy
suggests
the
risk
we
run
will
be
smaller
and
every
time
we
make
the
trip
we
add
a
thousand
guineas
to
that
pile
there
think
of
it
father
the
elder
man
frowned
thoughtfully
well
he
said
at
length
if
you
go
with
them
tom
and
you
go
carefully
at
night
we
chance
it
once
at
least
not
tonight
though
it
late
now
and
you
all
need
sleep
i
take
the
first
watch
at
about
ten
of
the
evening
following
jeremy
bob
and
tom
stole
out
and
up
the
hill
in
the
darkness
they
were
but
carried
no
lantern
the
boys
being
confident
of
their
ability
to
find
the
cleft
in
the
ledge
without
a
light
a
half
hour
walking
brought
them
near
the
spot
and
jeremy
who
had
almost
an
indian
memory
for
the
lay
of
the
ground
soon
led
the
way
to
the
edge
of
the
chasm
dim
starlight
shone
through
the
gap
in
the
trees
above
the
ledge
but
there
was
only
darkness
below
in
the
pit
one
by
one
they
felt
their
way
down
and
at
last
all
three
stood
on
the
damp
earth
at
the
bottom
here
the
barrel
just
as
we
left
it
they
have
been
here
yet
jeremy
whispered
working
as
quickly
and
as
quietly
as
he
could
bob
reached
into
the
opening
in
the
keg
and
pulled
out
the
gold
piece
by
piece
while
the
others
taking
the
coins
from
his
fingers
filled
their
pockets
and
the
leather
pouches
they
had
brought
it
was
breathlessly
exciting
work
for
all
three
were
aware
of
the
danger
that
they
ran
when
finally
they
crawled
forth
laden
like
the
perspiration
was
thick
on
jeremy
forehead
knowing
the
character
of
pharaoh
daggs
so
well
he
realized
better
probably
than
either
of
his
companions
what
fate
they
might
expect
if
they
were
discovered
so
far
apparently
the
pirates
had
not
thought
of
setting
a
night
guard
on
the
ridge
if
they
continued
to
neglect
this
precaution
and
failed
to
find
the
treasure
themselves
three
more
trips
would
his
calculations
were
interrupted
by
the
sudden
snapping
of
a
twig
he
stopped
instantly
on
the
alert
behind
him
tom
and
bob
had
also
paused
neither
of
them
had
caused
the
sound
it
had
seemed
to
come
from
the
thick
bush
down
hill
to
the
right
for
an
endlessly
long
the
three
held
their
breath
listening
then
once
more
something
crackled
farther
away
this
time
and
in
a
more
southwesterly
direction
man
or
animal
whatever
it
was
that
made
the
sounds
was
moving
rapidly
away
from
them
jeremy
hunched
the
straps
of
his
heavy
pouch
higher
up
on
his
shoulder
and
led
on
again
faster
than
before
and
hurrying
forward
in
indian
file
they
reached
the
cabin
without
further
adventure
all
through
the
next
day
they
stood
watch
and
watch
at
the
shack
ready
for
the
attack
which
they
expected
to
develop
sooner
or
later
but
still
it
appeared
that
the
pirates
preferred
to
keep
out
of
sight
the
boys
had
told
amos
swan
of
the
noises
they
had
heard
the
previous
night
and
he
had
listened
with
a
grave
countenance
it
could
hardly
have
been
other
than
one
of
the
pirates
he
thought
for
he
was
quite
certain
that
except
for
a
few
rabbits
there
were
no
wild
animals
upon
the
island
still
he
said
if
you
were
moving
quietly
there
small
reason
to
believe
the
man
knew
you
were
near
if
he
did
know
and
made
such
a
noise
as
that
he
must
have
been
a
mighty
poor
woodsman
the
boys
anxious
that
nothing
should
prevent
another
trip
to
the
accepted
this
logic
without
demur
the
following
night
amos
swan
decided
to
go
with
the
boys
himself
leaving
tom
on
guard
at
the
cabin
as
before
they
armed
themselves
with
guns
pistols
and
and
ascended
the
hillside
in
the
inky
dark
there
were
no
stars
in
sight
and
a
faint
breeze
that
came
and
went
among
the
trees
foreboded
rain
this
prospect
of
impending
bad
weather
made
itself
felt
in
the
spirits
of
the
three
jeremy
accustomed
as
he
was
to
the
woods
drew
a
breath
of
apprehension
and
looked
scowlingly
aloft
as
he
heard
the
dismal
wind
in
the
hemlock
tops
ugh
he
shook
himself
nervously
and
plunged
forward
along
the
hillcrest
a
few
moments
later
they
were
gathered
about
the
barrel
at
the
bottom
of
the
cleft
it
was
even
darker
than
they
had
found
it
on
their
previous
visit
jeremy
and
his
father
had
to
grope
in
the
pitchy
blackness
for
the
coins
that
bob
held
out
to
them
their
pockets
were
about
when
there
came
a
whispered
exclamation
from
the
delaware
boy
there
some
sort
of
box
in
here
buried
in
the
gold
he
said
too
big
to
pull
out
through
the
hole
where
your
dirk
jeremy
the
latter
knelt
astride
the
keg
and
working
in
the
dark
began
to
enlarge
the
opening
with
the
blade
of
his
after
a
few
minutes
he
thrust
his
hand
in
and
felt
the
box
it
was
apparently
of
wood
covered
with
leather
and
studded
over
with
scores
of
nails
its
top
was
only
seven
or
eight
inches
wide
by
less
than
a
foot
long
however
and
in
thickness
it
seemed
scarcely
a
hand
breadth
big
cold
drops
of
rain
were
beginning
to
fall
as
jeremy
resumed
his
cutting
he
made
the
opening
longer
as
well
as
wider
and
at
last
was
able
by
hard
tugging
to
get
the
box
through
he
thrust
it
into
his
pouch
and
they
recommenced
the
filling
of
their
pockets
with
goldpieces
before
a
dozen
coins
had
been
removed
a
sudden
red
glare
on
the
walls
of
the
chasm
caused
the
three
to
leap
to
their
feet
at
the
same
instant
the
rain
increased
to
a
downpour
and
they
looked
up
to
see
a
torch
in
the
opening
above
them
splutter
and
go
out
the
wet
darkness
came
down
blacker
than
before
but
in
that
second
of
illumination
they
had
seen
framed
in
the
torchlit
cleft
a
pair
of
gleaming
light
eyes
and
a
cruelly
snarling
mouth
set
in
a
face
made
horrible
by
the
livid
scar
that
ran
from
chin
to
eyebrow
across
its
broken
nose
jeremy
clutched
at
bob
and
his
father
this
way
he
gasped
through
the
hissing
rain
and
plunged
along
the
black
chasm
toward
the
southern
end
where
it
debouched
upon
the
hillside
they
clambered
over
some
boulders
and
emerged
in
the
undergrowth
a
score
of
yards
from
the
point
where
the
barrel
had
been
found
come
on
whispered
jeremy
hoarsely
and
started
eastward
along
the
slope
burdened
as
they
were
they
ran
through
the
woods
at
desperate
speed
the
noise
of
their
going
drowned
by
the
descending
flood
in
the
haste
of
flight
it
was
impossible
to
keep
together
when
jeremy
had
put
close
to
half
a
mile
between
himself
and
the
chasm
he
paused
panting
and
listened
for
the
others
but
apparently
they
were
not
near
he
decided
to
cut
across
the
ridge
and
started
up
the
hill
when
he
heard
a
crash
in
the
brush
just
above
him
father
he
called
under
his
breath
to
his
dismay
he
was
answered
by
a
startled
oath
and
the
next
moment
he
saw
a
tall
figure
coming
at
him
swinging
a
cutlass
the
pirate
was
a
bare
ten
feet
away
jeremy
aimed
his
pistol
and
pulled
the
trigger
but
only
a
dull
click
responded
the
priming
was
wet
illustration
a
sudden
red
glare
on
the
walls
of
the
chasm
at
that
instant
the
cutlass
passed
his
head
with
an
ugly
sound
and
jeremy
desperate
flung
his
pistol
straight
at
the
pirate
face
as
it
left
his
hand
he
heard
it
strike
then
as
the
man
went
down
with
a
groan
he
doubled
in
his
tracks
like
a
hare
and
ran
back
heading
up
across
the
hill
it
was
not
till
he
was
over
the
ridge
and
well
down
the
slope
toward
home
that
he
dropped
to
a
walk
his
breath
was
coming
in
gasps
that
hurt
him
like
a
knife
between
his
ribs
and
his
legs
were
so
weak
he
could
hardly
depend
on
them
he
had
run
nearly
two
miles
up
hill
and
down
in
heavy
clothes
drenched
with
rain
and
carrying
a
dozen
pounds
of
gold
besides
the
flintlock
which
he
still
clutched
in
his
left
hand
somewhere
behind
him
he
had
dropped
the
box
found
amid
the
treasure
but
he
was
far
too
tired
to
look
for
it
more
dead
than
alive
he
crawled
at
last
up
to
the
door
of
the
cabin
and
staggered
in
when
tom
opened
to
his
knock
while
he
gasped
out
his
story
the
older
brother
looked
more
closely
to
the
barring
of
the
and
put
fresh
powder
in
the
of
the
guns
ten
minutes
after
jeremy
his
father
appeared
wet
to
the
skin
and
with
a
grim
look
around
his
bearded
jaws
he
too
was
spent
with
running
but
he
would
have
gone
out
again
at
once
when
he
heard
that
bob
was
still
missing
if
the
boys
had
not
dissuaded
him
jeremy
was
sure
that
if
bob
had
escaped
he
would
soon
reach
the
cabin
for
he
had
the
lay
of
the
island
well
in
mind
now
and
so
while
tom
kept
watch
they
lay
down
with
their
clothes
on
before
the
fire
chapter
xxx
the
gray
november
morning
dawned
damp
and
cold
in
the
sheer
exhaustion
that
followed
on
their
adventure
of
the
night
before
jeremy
and
his
father
slept
heavily
till
close
to
nine
when
tom
wakened
them
his
face
was
haggard
with
watching
and
he
looked
so
worried
that
they
had
no
need
to
ask
him
if
bob
had
come
in
it
was
a
gloomy
party
that
sat
down
to
the
morning
meal
the
youngest
could
eat
nothing
for
thinking
of
his
chum
fate
while
his
father
still
spoke
hopefully
of
the
possibility
that
the
boy
might
have
found
a
hiding
place
which
he
dared
not
leave
jeremy
could
only
remember
the
frightful
scarred
visage
of
pharaoh
daggs
looming
in
the
torchlight
he
knew
that
bob
would
find
little
mercy
behind
that
cruel
face
and
he
could
not
throw
off
the
conviction
that
the
lad
had
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
the
pirates
all
day
standing
at
the
loopholes
they
waited
for
some
sign
either
of
bob
return
or
what
seemed
more
probable
an
attack
by
the
buccaneer
crew
but
as
the
hours
passed
no
moving
form
broke
the
dark
line
of
trees
above
them
on
the
slope
at
length
the
dusk
fell
and
they
gave
up
hope
of
seeing
the
boy
again
though
on
the
other
score
their
vigilance
was
redoubled
the
night
went
by
however
as
quietly
as
though
the
island
were
deserted
it
was
about
two
hours
after
sunrise
that
jeremy
stole
out
to
give
fodder
to
the
sheep
penned
in
the
stockade
ever
since
the
first
alarm
he
had
been
gone
a
bare
two
minutes
when
he
rushed
back
into
the
cabin

cried
in

all

he
said
following
the
two
boys
he
hurried
outside
jeremy
had
run
down
the
hill
to
the
beach
where
he
stood
gazing
intently
at
the
craft
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
after
a
moment
he
turned
excitedly

he
shouted

not

fine

himself
getting
into
the
cutter
a
big
man
in
a
blue
cloak
had
just
stepped
into
the
stern
sheets
of
the
boat
and
seeing
the
figures
on
the
shore
he
now
waved
a
hand
in
their
direction

minutes
captain

jumped
out
upon
the

and
with
a
roar
of
greeting
caught
jeremy

in
his

he
laughed
ye
look
glad
to
see
us
did
know
we
was
headed
up
this
way
did
ye
but
here
we
be
soon
as
the
sloop
was
ready
curtis
had
a
light
cargo
for
boston
town
and
he
told
me
to
coast
up
here
on
the
same
trip
he
wants
bob
home
again
why
what
ails
ye
boy
they
were
climbing
the
path
toward
the
shack
when
job
noticed
the
downcast
look
on
jeremy
face
and
interrupted
himself
in
a
few
words
the
boy
told
what
had
happened
during
the
brief
week
they
had
been
on
the
island
by
the
great
bull
whale
muttered
the
in
astonishment

brig
treasure
sure
enough
and
that
devil
daggs
see
here
if
bob
alive
we
got
to
get
him
out
of
that
he
swung
about
and
hailed
the
boat
crew
all
six
of
whom
had
remained
on
the
beach
adams
and
you
mason
pull
back
to
the
sloop
and
bring
off
all
the
men
in
the
port
watch
with
their
cutlasses
and
the
rest
of
you
come
up
here
as
soon
as
job
had
shaken
hands
with
jeremy
father
and
brother
they
entered
the
cabin
now
jeremy
said
the
skipper
you
say
this
craft
is
careened
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
close
to
the
place
where
stede
bonnet
landed
us
that
time
how
many
men
have
they
we
do
know
the
boy
replied
but
i
do
think
daggs
had
time
to
gather
a
big
crew
and
what
more
he
figure
the
fewer
the
better
when
it
came
to
splitting
up
the
gold
i
doubt
if
there
above
fifteen
men
maybe
only
fourteen
now
he
grinned
as
he
thought
of
the
big
pirate
who
had
attacked
him
in
the
woods
good
said
job
we
have
sixteen
besides
you
swan
and
your
two
boys
an
even
twenty
counting
myself
if
we
ca
put
that
crowd
under
hatches
i
no
sailorman
the
crew
of
the
bristling
with
arms
and
eager
for
action
now
came
up
without
wasting
time
job
told
them
what
was
afoot
and
they
moved
forward
up
the
hill
once
among
the
trees
the
attacking
party
spread
out
in
irregular
with
tom
and
jeremy
scouting
a
little
in
advance
the
stillness
of
the
woods
was
almost
oppressive
as
they
went
forward
all
the
men
seemed
to
feel
it
and
proceeded
with
more
and
more
caution
used
to
the
of
they
did
not
relish
this
silent
approach
against
an
unseen
enemy
clearing
the
ridge
they
came
down
at
length
to
the
edge
of
the
beach
close
to
the
old
pirate
anchorage
and
jeremy
led
the
way
along
through
the
bushes
toward
the
mouth
of
the
reedy
inlet
working
carefully
down
the
shore
to
the
place
whence
bob
and
he
had
sighted
the
spars
of
the
buccaneer
he
climbed
above
the
reeds
and
peered
up
the
creek
to
his
surprise
the
masts
had
disappeared
she
gone
he
gasped
job
and
tom
looked
in
turn
certain
it
was
that
no
vessel
lay
in
the
creek
perhaps
they
sighted
the
suggested
jeremy
if
so
they
have
gotten
far
they
likely
taken
the
rest
of
the
gold
and
bob
must
be
aboard
too
if
he
still
alive
as
they
turned
to
go
back
one
of
the
sailors
who
had
walked
down
to
the
reeds
at
the
edge
of
the
creek
hurried
up
with
a
dark
object
in
his
fist
he
held
it
out
as
he
drew
near
and
they
saw
that
it
was
a
pistol
covered
with
a
mass
of
black
mud
jeremy
saw
a
gleam
of
metal
through
the
sticky
lump
and
quickly
scraping
away
the
mud
from
the
mounting
he
disclosed
a
silver
plate
which
bore
the
still
terrible
name
stede
bonnet
the
boy
gave
a
cry
of
pleasure
as
he
saw
it
and
thrust
the
weapon
quickly
into
job
hands
look
he
exclaimed
it
bob
pistol
and
there
only
one
way
it
could
have
gotten
where
it
was
he
must
have
thrown
it
from
the
deck
as
they
went
past
thinking
we
find
it
see
here
they
ca
be
gone
more
than
a
few
hours
for
there
not
a
bit
of
rust
on
the
iron
parts
maybe
we
could
catch
them
job
if
we
hurry
job
turned
to
his
men
and
called
what
say
you
lads
shall
we
give
them
a
chase
a
chorus
of
vociferous
ay
ay
was
the
answer
here
we
go
then
he
shouted
and
led
the
way
back
up
the
hill
at
a
trot
as
they
reached
the
ridge
jeremy
cut
over
to
the
left
a
little
through
the
trees
so
that
his
course
lay
past
the
treasure
cleft
when
he
reached
it
he
found
just
what
he
had
expected
the
shattered
staves
of
the
barrel
lying
open
on
the
ledge
and
several
rough
excavations
in
the
dirt
at
the
bottom
of
the
chasm
where
the
buccaneers
had
searched
greedily
for
more
gold
the
charred
remnants
of
a
bonfire
a
few
yards
further
down
the
cleft
showed
that
they
had
worked
partly
at
night
leaving
the
ledge
the
boy
was
hurrying
back
to
join
the
main
party
when
he
came
out
upon
an
elevated
space
clear
of
trees
from
which
one
could
command
a
view
of
the
sea
to
the
west
and
south
involuntarily
he
paused
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
swept
the
horizon
slowly
then
he
gave
a
start
for
straight
away
to
the
westward
in
a
gap
between
two
islands
was
a
white
speck
of
sail
job
he
yelled
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
job
the
big
skipper
was
only
a
short
distance
away
and
he
came
through
the
trees
at
a
run
followed
by
most
of
his
men
in
answer
to
jeremy
hail
no
words
were
necessary
the
boy
pointing
finger
led
their
eyes
instantly
to
the
ship
job
took
a
quick
look
at
the
sun
and
the
distant
islands
to
fix
his
bearings
then
set
out
for
the
northern
inlet
again
even
faster
than
before
as
they
came
running
down
the
slope
toward
the
cabin
amos
swan
emerged
gun
in
hand
evidently
believing
that
they
were
in
full
rout
before

left

jeremy
as
he
reached
the
door
we
saw
their

we
going
to
chase
them
we
sure
now
that

his

looked
relieved

he
said

stay

the

with
a
dozen
of
his
men
was
starting
in
the

and
had
already
hailed

the

sent
ashore
tom
and
jeremy
hurried
into
the
cabin
and
stuffing
some
clothes
into
along
with
a
brace
of
good
pistols
and
a
cutlass
apiece
were
soon
ready
to
embark
chapter
xxxi
there
was
a
bustle
of
action
aboard
the
sloop
when
the
boys
swarmed
up
her
side
one
chanty
was
being
sung
up
forward
where
half
a
dozen
sturdy
seamen
were
heaving
at
the
capstan
bars
and
another
was
going
amidships
as
the
throat
of
the
long
main
gaff
went
to
the
top
captain
job
stood
on
the
afterdeck
constantly
shouting
new
orders
his
big
voice
made
itself
heard
above
the
singing
the
groan
of
and
the
crash
of
the
canvas
flapping
in
the
northwest
wind
it
was
a
clear
sunny
day
with
a
bite
of
approaching
winter
in
the
air
and
the
boys
were
glad
to
button
their
jackets
tight
and
move
into
the
lee
of
the
here

cried

for

take
a
run
below
jeremy
and
bring
up
an
armload
of

if
any
of

need
cleaning
tom
jeremy
scurried
down
the
companion
ladder
and
forward
along
the
starboard
gun
deck
to
the
rack
of
small
arms
near
the
hatch
jeremy
was
pleased
to
see
that
the
sloop
carried
a
full
complement
of
ten
broadside
guns
beside
a
long
brass
cannon
in
the
bows
in
fact
she
was
armed
like
a
regular
the
tubs
were
filled
and
neat
little
piles
of
and
cannister
stood
beside
each
gun
the
he
thought
was
likely
to
give
a
good
account
of
herself
if
she
could
come
to
grips
with
the
buccaneers
stepping
on
deck
once
more
his
arms
piled
with
hangers
jeremy
found
that
the
sloop
had
already
cleared
the
bay
on
her
starboard
tack
and
was
just
coming
about
to
make
a
long
reach
of
it
to
port
the
pirate
sail
was
no
longer
in
sight
in
the
west
but
as
several
islands
filled
the
horizon
in
that
direction
it
seemed
likely
that
she
had
passed
beyond
them
jeremy
approached
the
captain
how
far
ahead
do
you
think
they
are
he
asked
when
we
sighted
they
were
about
four
to
the
westward
answered
job
if
they
making
ordinary
sailing
they
gained
close
to
three
more
since
then
but
if
they
carrying
much
canvas
it
may
be
more
we
sha
come
near
them
before
dark
at
any
rate
he
cast
an
eye
aloft
as
he
spoke
and
jeremy
gaze
followed
the
was
carrying
topsails
and
both
jibs
with
a
single
reef
in
her
fore
and
main
sails
she
was
scudding
along
at
a
great
rate
with
the
whitecaps
racing
by
close
below
the
lee
gunports
jeremy
whistled
with
delight
he
had
seen
stede
bonnet
crowd
canvas
once
or
twice
but
never
in
so
good
a
cause
the
wind
held
from
the
northwest
gaining
in
strength
rather
than
decreasing
and
the
sloop
heeled
far
to
port
sped
along
on
a
course
after
of
an
hour
of
this
kind
of
sailing
they
were
close
to
the
group
of
islands
and
sighting
a
passage
to
the
northward
swung
over
on
the
other
tack
a
rough
beat
to
starboard
brought
them
into
the
gap
though
they
crossed
a
grim
black
shoal
at
the
narrowest
part
job
did
not
shorten
sail
but
steered
straight
on
as
fast
as
the
wind
would
take
him
and
at
length
they
came
clear
of
the
headland
and
saw
a
great
stretch
of
open
sea
to
the
southwestward
with
a
faint
white
dot
of
sail
at
its
farthest
edge
at
the
sight
a
hearty
cheer
went
up
from
the
seamen
clustered
along
the
port
rail
a
lean
man
with
keen
black
eyes
came
aft
to
the
tiller
where
jeremy
and

stood
with

lookout
tonight
he
continued
we
sha
be
able
to
keep
in
sight
at
this
distance
if
they
sighted
us
which
most
likely
they
have
i
going
up
to
have
a
look
at
poll
now
accompanied
by
the
two
boys
he
made
his
way
along
the
steeply
canted
deck
of
the
plunging
schooner
to
the
breach
of
the
at
the
bow
ever
seen
this
gal
afore
jeremy
asked
job
shouting
to
make
himself
heard
above
the
hiss
and
thunder
of
the
water
under
the
forefoot
the
old
gun
we
had
aboard
the
stede
bonnet
never
had
a
piece
like
this
cast
in
bristol
she
was
in
there
the
letters
that
tells
it
and
he
patted
the
bright
breach
lovingly
sighting
along
the
brazen
barrel
and
swinging
the
nose
from
right
to
left
till
he
brought
the
gun
to
bear
squarely
on
the
white
speck
that
was
the
pirate
sloop
still
in
the
sea
ahead
come
morning
polly
my
gal
he
chuckled
we
let
you
talk
to
as
he
spoke
the
fiery
disk
of
the
sun
was
slipping
into
the
ocean
across
the
starboard
bow
with
sunset
the
breeze
lightened
perceptibly
and
job
ordered
the
reefs
shaken
out
of
the
fore
and
mainsails
and
an
extra
jib
set
then
he
and
the
boys
who
although
they
had
quarters
aft
had
been
assigned
to
the

watch
went
below

turned
in

on

bells

greatcoat
up
about
his
ears
for
the
breeze
came
cold
he
worked
his
way
forward
along
the
high
weather
rail
and
took
up
his
lookout
station
on
the
starboard
bow
overhead
the
midnight
sky
burned
bright
with
stars
that
seemed
to
flicker
like
in
the
wind
a
moon
rode
down
the
west
and
threw
a
faint
radiance
across
the
heaving
seas
it
was
blowing
harder
now
the
wind
boomed
loud
in
the
taut
stays
and
the
rising
waves
broke
smashingly
over
the
bow
at
times
forcing
the
foremast
hands
to
cling
like
monkeys
to
the
rail
and
rigging
captain
job
with
tom
to
help
him
stood
grimly
at
the
thrashing
tiller
and
drove
the
sloop
southwestward
at
a
terrific
gait
the
sails
had
been
again
during
the
mate
watch
but
with
the
wind
still
freshening
the
staunch
little
craft
was
carrying
an
enormous
amount
of
canvas
job
howland
was
a
sailor
of
the
breed
that
was
to
reach
its
climax
a
hundred
years
later
in
the
captains
of
the
great
yankee
clippers
men
who
broke
sailing
records
and
captured
the
world
trade
because
they
dared
to
walk
their
tall
ships
past
the
heavy
foreign
merchantmen
that
rolled
under
triple
reefs
in
half
a
gale
of
wind
one
by
one
the
hours
of
the
watch
went
by
jeremy
drenched
and
shivering
but
thrilling
to
the
excitement
of
the
chase
stuck
to
his
post
at
the
rail
beside
the
long
bow
gun
his
eyes
were
fixed
constantly
on
the
sea
ahead
and
abeam
while
his
thoughts
racing
on
followed
the
pirate
schooner
close
how
was
bob
to
be
gotten
off
alive
he
wondered
for
he
had
come
to
believe
that
his
chum
was
aboard
the
fleeing
craft
if
it
came
to
a
running
fight
their
cannonade
might
sink
her
in
which
case
the
boy
would
be
drowned
along
with
his
captors
and
there
were
other
things
that
could
happen
jeremy
groaned
aloud
as
he
thought
of
the
fate
that
pharaoh
daggs
had
once
so
nearly
meted
out
to
him
he
felt
again
the
bite
of
the
hemp
at
his
wrists
and
saw
that
pitiless
gleam
in
the
strange
light
eyes
of
the
pirate
would
daggs
try
to
settle
his
long
score
against
the
boys
by
some
brutality
a
sudden
hail
cut
in
upon
his
thoughts
sail
ho
the
lookout
on
the
other
side
had
cried
where
away
came
job
deep
shout
three
points
on
the
port
bow
answered
the
seaman
an
not
above
a
league
off
jeremy
straining
his
eyes
into
the
night
made
out
the
dim
patch
of
sail
ahead
how
she
headed
called
the
captain
again
is
she
still
on
her
port
tack
or
running
before
the
wind
still
beating
up
to
the
west
the
sailor
replied
good
cried
job
they
think
they
can
outsail
us
keep
her
in
sight
and
sing
out
if
you
see
her
fall
off
the
wind
half
an
hour
later
the
watch
was
changed
and
jeremy
scrambled
into
his
warm
bunk
for
a
few
hours
more
sleep
it
was
broad
daylight
when
he
and
tom
reached
the
deck
once
more
and
went
eagerly
forward
to
join
the
little
knot
of
seamen
in
the
bows
all
eyes
were
turned
toward
the
horizon
ahead
where
the
sails
of
the
fleeing
schooner
loomed
gray
in
the
morning
haze
the
wind
which
had
shifted
a
little
to
the
north
was
still
blowing
stiffly
heeling
both
sloops
over
at
a
sharp
angle
the
had
gained
somewhat
during
the
morning
watch
but
the
pirates
had
now
evidently
become
desperate
and
put
on
all
the
sail
their
craft
would
carry
so
that
the
two
vessels
sped
on
league
after
league
without
apparent
change
of
position
job
who
had
now
taken
the
tiller
again
called
to
jeremy
after
a
while
here
lad
he
said
when
the
boy
reached
the
poop
lend
me
a
hand
with
this
kicker
jeremy
laid
hold
with
a
will
and
found
that
it
took
almost
all
his
strength
along
with
that
of
the
powerful
captain
to
hold
the
schooner
on
her
course
at
times
when
a
big
beam
sea
caught
her
she
would
yaw
fearfully
falling
off
several
points
and
could
only
be
brought
back
to
windward
by
jamming
the
thrashing
rudder
hard
over
we
lose
headway
when
she
does
that
do
we
job
panted
the
boy
after
one
such
effort
and
i
reckon
we
could
lash
the
beam
fast
to
keep
her
this
way
could
we
no
i
see
it
has
to
be
free
so
as
to
move
all
the
time
still
as
he
staggered
to
and
fro
at
the
end
of
the
tiller
the
boy
thought
rapidly
finally
he
recommenced
job
this
may
sound
foolish
to
you
but
why
could
we
lash
her
on
both
sides
and
yet
give
her
play
look
this
way
rig
a
little
pulley
here
and
one
here
he
indicated
places
on
the
deck
close
to
the
rail
on
either
quarter
then
reeve
a
line
from
the
through
each
one
and
bring
it
back
with
three
or
four
turns
around
a
windlass
drum
a
little
way
there
then
you
could
keep
hold
of
the
arms
of
the
windlass
and
only
let
the
tiller
move
as
much
as
you
needed
to
either
way
by
the
great
bull
whale
job
laughed
as
he
grasped
the
boy
plan
i
wonder
if
that
would
work
jeremy
boy
we
find
out
anyhow
braisted
he
called
to
the
ship
carpenter
up
with
some
lumber
and
a
good
stout
line
and
a
pair
of
spare
blocks
if
you
got
them
lively
now
in
a
jiffy
the
carpenter
had
tumbled
the
tackle
out
on
the
deck
and
under
the
direction
of
job
began
to
rig
it
according
to
scheme
it
was
a
matter
of
a
few
moments
only
once
he
caught
the
idea
when
at
length
the
final
stout
knot
had
been
tied
job
still
keeping
his
mighty
clutch
on
the
tiller
beam
motioned
to
jeremy
to
take
hold
of
the
windlass
the
boy
jumped
forward
eagerly
and
seized
two
of
the
rude
spokes
that
radiated
horizontally
from
the
hub
the
position
was
an
awkward
one
but
with
a
slight
pull
he
found
that
he
could
swing
the
windlass
rapidly
in
either
direction
avast
there
avast
came
job
bass
bellow
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
jeremy
saw
the
big
skipper
flung
from
side
to
side
in
spite
of
himself
as
the
windlass
was
turned
the
seamen
who
had
gathered
to
watch
were
roaring
with
laughter
and
job
himself
was
chuckling
as
he
let
go
the
tiller
and
hurried
to
jeremy
side
taking
a
grip
on
the
spokes
he
spun
them
back
and
forth
once
or
twice
to
feel
how
the
vessel
answered
her
helm
under
this
new
contraption
and
in
a
moment
had
it
working
handsomely
he
was
using
the
first
ship
the
sloop
which
had
yawed
and
lost
some
headway
during
this
interlude
now
struck
her
stride
again
and
drove
along
with
her
nose
held
steady
a
full
closer
to
the
wind
than
had
been
possible
before
job
perceived
this
and
loosed
one
hand
long
enough
to
strike
jeremy
a
mighty
blow
on
the
back
she
works
boy
he
cried
and
at
this
gait
we
catch
them
before
noon
indeed
the
crew
had
already
noticed
the
difference
in
their
sailing
and
were
lining
the
bows
waving
their
caps
in
the
air
and
yelling
with
excitement
as
they
watched
the
distance
between
the
two
craft
slowly
shorten
an
hour
passed
and
the
gunners
were
sent
below
to
make
ready
their
pieces
for
the
lead
of
the
pirate
sloop
had
been
cut
to
a
bare
mile
job
had
turned
the
wheel
over
to
hawkes
and
now
with
three
picked
men
to
help
him
was
ramming
home
a
heavy
charge
of
powder
in
the
long
nine
on
top
of
it
he
drove
down
the
then
bent
above
the
swinging
it
back
and
forth
as
he
brought
the
muzzle
to
bear
on
the
topsails
of
the
pirate
schooner
whose
black
hull
was
now
plainly
visible
he
sniffed
the
wind
and
measured
the
distance
with
his
eye
when
his
calculations
were
complete
he
turned
and
held
up
his
hand
in
signal
to
the
helmsman
as
the
swivel
allowed
movement
only
from
side
to
side
he
must
depend
on
the
cant
of
the
deck
for
his
elevation
holding
the
long
gunner
match
lighted
in
his
hand
he
waited
for
the
exact
second
when
the
schooner
bow
was
lifted
on
a
wave
and
swinging
in
the
right
direction
then
touched
the
powder
train
there
was
a
hiss
and
flare
and
at
the
end
of
a
second
or
two
a
terrific
roar
as
the
charge
was
fired
the
smoke
was
blown
clear
almost
instantly
and
every
one
leaned
forward
watching
the
sea
ahead
with
tense
eagerness
at
length
a
column
of
white
spray
lifted
a
scant
hundred
yards
astern
of
the
other
sloop
the
crew
cheered
for
it
was
a
splendid
shot
at
that
distance
and
in
a
seaway
the
sky
was
thickening
to
windward
and
it
grew
harder
momentarily
to
see
objects
at
a
distance
job
was
already
at
work
superintending
the
of
the
gun
and
reloading
with
his
own
hands
there
was
a
long
moment
while
he
waited
for
a
favorable
chance
then
long
poll
shook
the
deck
once
more
with
the
crash
of
her
discharge
this
time
the
shot
fell
just
ahead
and
to
windward
of
the
enemy
so
close
that
the
spray
blew
back
into
the
rigging
job
had
bracketed
his
target
but
the
that
were
sweeping
past
rendered
his
task
a
difficult
one
grimly
but
with
swift
certainty
of
movement
he
went
about
his
preparations
for
a
third
attempt
suddenly
there
was
a
shout
from
jeremy
who
had
climbed
into
the
forestays
for
a
better
view
look
there
he
cried
they
lowering
a
boat
there
something
white
in
it
like
a
flag
of
truce
in
the
lee
of
the
pirate
vessel
a
small
boat
could
be
seen
tossing
crazily
in
the
heavy
seas
job
who
had
called
for
his
spyglass
looked
long
and
earnestly
at
the
tiny
craft
there
but
one
man
in
it
he
announced
at
length
and
he
showing
a
bit
of
something
white
as
jeremy
says
here
lad
you
the
best
eyes
on
the
sloop
see
if
you
can
make
out
more
the
boy
focussed
the
glass
on
the
little
boat
which
was
now
drifting
rapidly
to
the
southeast
already
nearly
opposite
their
bows
the
figure
in
it
stood
up
waving
frantic
arms
to
one
side
and
the
other
it
bob
jeremy
almost
screamed
that
a
signal
we
used
to
have
when
we
were
hunting
it
means
here
he
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
port
your

roared

stand
by
to
slack

had
bracketed
his

the
fell
off
the
wind
with
a
lurch
and
spun
away
to
leeward
bowing
into
the
running
seas
five
minutes
later
they
hauled
bob
drenched
and
dripping
to
the
deck
chapter
xxxiii
the
boy
was
pale
and
haggard
and
so
weak
he
could
hardly
stand
alone
but
he
looked
about
him
with
an
eager
grin
as
tom
and
jeremy
helped
him
toward
the
companion
why
he
gasped
here
old
job
what
he
doing
up
here
as
the
latter
strode
aft
to
seize
his
hand
ay
lad
laughed
the
big
mariner
a
mighty
relief
showing
in
his
face
we
all
your
friends
aboard
here
but
how
came
those
devils
to
let
you
off
so
easy
we
figured
we
have
to
fight
to
get
you
and
mighty
lucky
to
do
it
at
that
the
schooner
had
come
into
the
wind
again
and
was
heading
westward
in
pursuit
of
the
pirate
now
hidden
in
the
murk
ahead
bob
was
helped
to
the
cabin
and
propped
up
in
a
bunk
while
his
friends
hastened
to
get
some
dry
clothes
on
him
a
pull
of
brandy
stopped
his
shivering
i
thought
none
of
you
would
ever
see
me
alive
he
said
soberly
but
job
before
i
tell
you
all
about
it
are
you
sure
you
lost
sight
of
daggs
sloop
they
were
worried
about
your
shooting
and
figured
the
only
chance
they
had
was
to
set
me
adrift
and
then
get
away
in
the
dirty
weather
while
you
were
fishing
me
out
they
never
have
given
me
up
if
that
second
shot
had
mighty
near
gone
through
and
through
the
old
the
said
job
i
thought
i
knew
the
cut
of
that
big
mainsail
and
she
was
painted
black
too
well
their
trick
succeeded
just
this
minute
we
have
no
more
chance
of
finding
than
a
needle
in
a
haystack
but
it
may
clear
again
before
night
and
then
we
see
go
ahead
now
and
spin
your
yarn
my
lad
and
bob
swigging
hot
tea
and
munching
a
biscuit
began
once
more
to
tell
his
story
after
we
separated
and
started
to
run
up
on
the
hill
that
night
he
said
i
seemed
to
lose
all
my
sense
of
direction
for
a
while
i
was
scared
for
one
thing
i
freely
admit
when
i
saw
daggs
face
in
the
torchlight
leaning
over
us
there
by
the
treasure
barrel
it
frightened
me
pretty
nearly
out
of
my
senses
so
i
started
to
run
without
an
idea
of
where
i
was
going
and
by
the
time
i
got
my
wits
back
i
tell
just
where
i
was
in
the
rain
and
the
dark
i
seemed
to
be
right
on
top
of
the
ridge
but
i
had
several
times
i
remembered
and
when
i
tried
to
figure
which
side
of
the
hill
i
should
go
down
i
could
for
the
life
of
me
decide
finally
i
said
to
myself
do
be
a
fool
which
way
was
the
wind
blowing
when
we
set
out
from
the
shack
aha
it
was
north
says
i
well
then
this
must
be
the
way
to
the
cabin
straight
into
the
wind
and
down
the
hill
i
started
bearing
over
to
my
right
so
as
to
come
out
just
above
the
but
interrupted
jeremy
when
that
storm
came
up
the
wind
backed
clear
round
into
the
south
i
know
it
now
bob
answered
but
i
did
then
i
kept
right
on
tickled
that
i
was
out
of
it
so
well
and
wondering
where
the
rest
of
you
had
gotten
to
pretty
soon
i
came
to
some
low
land
that
i
remember
but
i
saw
a
light
off
ahead
and
to
my
right
and
decided
that
was
the
cabin
i
blundered
along
through
the
trees
till
i
was
quite
close
and
then
i
discovered
that
the
light
came
from
a
bonfire
i
stopped
for
a
second
puzzled
for
i
was
sure
i
must
be
near
the
cabin
i
wondered
if
the
pirates
had
captured
it
i
stole
up
still
closer
and
watched
the
light
and
presently
a
buccaneer
walked
in
front
of
it
that
was
enough
for
me
i
turned
and
started
to
run
and
at
about
the
third
step
i
fell
plump
into
the
arms
of
a
pirate
you
see
i
had
walked
straight
toward
their
part
of
the
island
by
making
that
silly
mistake
this
fellow
got
a
grip
on
my
collar
and
i
could
break
loose
though
i
warrant
his
shins
are
tender
yet
where
i
kicked
him
he
hauled
me
down
to
the
fire
and
he
and
three
others
who
were
there
looked
me
over
the
one
that
had
caught
me
was
a
big
mulatto
as
a
customer
as
i
ever
saw
and
the
others
were
no
lambs
i
tell
you
my
hearties
daggs
has
gathered
up
a
pretty
lot
of
rascals
in
this
crew
not
one
of
but
looks
as
if
he
knife
you
for
a
copper
farthing
these
four
by
the
fire
wasted
no
time
but
went
through
my
pockets
in
a
hurry
they
took
my
pistol
and
were
quarreling
about
dividing
the
goldpieces
i
had
when
the
rest
of
the
crowd
began
to
appear
they
were
all
wet
and
in
a
bad
temper
for
a
dozen
other
reasons
plenty
of
curses
came
my
way
but
no
one
laid
a
hand
on
me
for
they
had
a
mighty
fear
of
pharaoh
daggs
when
he
finally
came
he
swore
at
them
till
they
slunk
around
like
whipped
curs
he
was
in
an
ugly
mood
that
night
seemingly
he
was
disappointed
in
the
amount
of
treasure
they
had
found
besides
that
they
had
come
on
one
of
their
best
men
with
his
head
beaten
in
and
you
and
your
father
had
gotten
clean
away
things
looked
black
enough
for
me
i
can
tell
you
daggs
and
the
mulatto
who
is
his
mate
started
in
to
question
me
after
they
had
grumbled
awhile
they
knew
already
how
many
of
you
there
were
at
the
cabin
but
they
asked
about
your
guns
and
supplies
of
course
i
did
make
the
stronghold
any
weaker
in
the
telling
when
they
had
all
the
information
they
thought
they
could
get
out
of
me
they
held
a
sort
of
council
some
wanted
to
go
right
over
before
light
and
attack
the
cabin
others
were
for
broaching
a
barrel
of
rum
first
and
making
thorough
preparations
finally
daggs
decided
to
put
it
off
until
they
could
get
some
pitch
and
dry
grass
ready
so
as
to
set
fire
to
the
roof
it
was
nearly
daylight
by
this
time
and
they
started
back
through
the
reeds
toward
their
sloop
leading
me
along
with
them
we
travelled
half
a
mile
or
so
down
a
crooked
black
trail
only
wide
enough
for
one
man
at
a
time
and
ankle
deep
in
the
mud
of
the
swamp
when
we
reached
the
schooner
they
stuck
a
pair
of
handcuffs
on
me
and
put
me
down
on
the
ballast
in
spite
of
the
filth
and
the
cold
i
was
so
that
i
tumbled
on
the
nearest
pile
of
old
chains
and
went
to
sleep
i
woke
up
late
in
the
afternoon
and
i
do
think
i
was
ever
so
stiff
and
uncomfortable
and
hungry
in
my
life
i
made
my
way
over
to
the
hatch
and
found
i
could
reach
the
combing
with
my
hands
so
i
pulled
myself
up
after
a
mighty
hard
tussle
try
it
some
time
with
your
hands
tied
most
of
the
pirates
were
forward
in
their
bunks
but
one
who
was
keeping
watch
on
deck
took
pity
on
me
and
gave
me
a
couple
of
biscuits
and
a
swig
of
water
he
was
more
or
less
talkative
besides
and
from
him
i
learned
that
daggs
planned
to
start
about
midnight
for
your
side
of
the
island
carrying
buckets
of
pitch
and
tinder
so
as
to
roast
you
out
as
you
may
imagine
this
kind
of
talk
nearly
turned
me
sick
with
fear
and
right
in
the
midst
of
it
pharaoh
daggs
came
on
deck
he
had
that
empty
sort
of
glare
in
his
eyes
that
we
used
to
see
sometimes
when
he
was
drunk
of
course
he
walked
straight
and
even
but
as
he
came
over
toward
us
with
his
teeth
showing
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
point
just
above
the
pirate
shoulder
i
almost
yelled
out
if
i
had
it
might
have
cost
me
my
life
right
there
he
walked
along
light
on
his
toes
like
a
cat
till
he
stood
two
feet
from
us
then
so
fast
i
hardly
knew
what
happened
he
hit
the
other
man
on
the
chin
with
his
fist
that
was
all
the
man
dropped
with
his
head
back
against
the
rail
and
daggs
went
off
chuckling
to
himself
but
not
making
any
noise
i
do
think
he
saw
me
at
all
for
his
attack
was
more
like
the
work
of
a
mad
dog
than
of
a
man
i
crept
away
and
got
below
decks
as
fast
as
might
be
and
there
i
stayed
hidden
till
after
dark
when
some
of
the
buccaneers
rousted
me
out
a
keg
of
rum
had
been
opened
in
the
waist
and
the
liquor
was
going
freely
most
of
the
crew
were
already
drunk
but
they
had
the
sense
to
chain
me
by
one
leg
to
the
foremast
and
then
made
me
run
back
and
forth
between
them
and
the
barrel
i
was
only
too
glad
no
cannikin
was
skimped
while
i
was
at
the
spigot
i
looked
around
and
remembered
some
of
the
wild
nights
we
had
seen
on
the
old
and
then
for
the
first
time
i
realized
that
the
deck
i
stood
on
was
the
same
gotten
hold
of
the
old
black
sloop
when
she
was
auctioned
at
charles
town
patched
up
her
bottom
and
here
she
was
buccaneering
once
more
where
the
gang
of
aboard
her
were
gathered
i
do
know
but
they
put
stede
bonnet
famous
crew
to
shame
pharaoh
daggs
was
somewhere
ashore
with
two
of
the
crew
till
nearly
midnight
when
he
returned
the
rest
were
lying
like
pigs
about
the
deck
he
had
sobered
slightly
enough
to
remember
the
undertaking
but
it
was
useless
to
think
of
rousing
those
sots
to
any
sort
of
endeavor
he
kicked
one
or
two
of
them
savagely
with
his
heavy
boot
too
but
it
got
hardly
more
than
a
grunt
from
them
he
stood
there
cursing
for
a
minute
then
came
over
and
looked
at
the
shackle
that
held
me
to
the
and
shook
it
to
make
sure
it
was
solid
before
he
went
below
he
had
something
done
up
in
a
cloth
that
he
held
mighty
tenderly
and
he
seemed
in
a
better
humor
i
curled
up
on
the
deck
and
by
wrapping
myself
in
a
greatcoat
which
i
found
beside
one
of
the
drunken
pirates
succeeded
in
keeping
reasonably
warm
when
morning
came
daggs
and
his
mulatto
mate
managed
to
wake
most
of
the
men
and
forced
them
to
get
out
and
forage
for
wood
and
water
while
they
themselves
crossed
the
ridge
to
reconnoitre
i
think
it
was
about
two
hours
after
sunrise
when
those
of
us
who
stayed
aboard
the
sloop
saw
figures
running
down
the
hill
the
buccaneers
got
out
and
picked
up
cutlasses
but
in
a
moment
daggs
reached
the
side
out
of
breath
with
his
haste
a
schooner
in
the
northern
cove
he
cried
landing
a
boat
now
we
have
any
time
to
lose
the
tide
past
full
already
cut
those
moorings
the
hemp
lines
were
slashed
through
with
cutlasses
and
the
men
with
one
accord
jumped
to
the
the
sloop
was
on
an
even
keel
and
just
off
the
bottom
a
few
strong
shoves
started
her
down
the
creek
my
hopes
of
escaping
began
to
go
down
for
there
i
was
still
chained
to
the
like
a
cow
put
out
to
grass
i
looked
around
me
in
desperation
for
i
wanted
to
leave
you
some
sign
at
least
of
my
whereabouts
then
my
eye
fell
on
a
little
heap
of
small
arms
that
had
been
thrown
down
near
the
forehatch
the
pistols
were
useless
to
me
as
i
had
no
powder
but
among
them
i
saw
the
bright
silver
mountings
of
my
own
the
one
that
used
to
be
stede
bonnet
we
were
drawing
near
the
creek
mouth
and
those
of
the
crew
who
were
not
at
the
poles
were
busy
unfurling
the
sails
i
picked
the
pistol
up
unobserved
and
waited
till
we
were
just
hauling
clear
of
the
creek
then
i
threw
it
overside
and
saw
it
strike
in
the
mud
did
you
find
it
yes
said
jeremy
that
how
we
knew
for
certain
that
you
been
captured
well
the
delaware
boy
went
on
there
not
much
more
to
tell
the
pirates
made
all
sail
to
the
southwest
but
after
we
cleared
the
islands
there
you
were
roaring
along
in
our
wake
daggs
thought
that
the
was
a
faster
sailer
than
your
craft
but
he
found
he
could
keep
her
as
close
to
the
wind
on
this
tack
i
do
think
he
wants
to
fight
if
he
can
help
it
but
he
was
getting
desperate
this
afternoon
before
the
weather
began
to
thicken
up
i
heard
him
tell
the
mate
he
rather
come
to
broadside
grips
than
risk
having
you
drop
a
shot
through
the
black
sloop
bottom
with
that
bowchaser
then
the
mist
started
to
come
over
and
i
guess
daggs
saw
his
chance
right
away
he
called
the
crew
aft
and
told
them
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
a
moment
later
i
found
myself
being
lowered
in
a
boat
into
that
wicked
sea
i
thought
they
were
trying
to
drown
me
out
of
hand
till
they
gave
me
a
piece
of
white
cloth
to
wave
then
i
got
an
inkling
of
their
idea
sure
enough
no
sooner
was
i
fairly
adrift
than
i
saw
you
put
over
in
my
direction
and
thinking
jeremy
might
be
aboard
i
gave
him
our
old
signal
it
worked
and
here
i
am
safe
enough
but
meanwhile
those
devils
have
got
off
into
the
mist
and
it
be
hard
to
follow
them
job
sat
thoughtful
pulling
at
his
pipe
he
seemed
to
be
cogitating
some
of
the
points
in
bob
narrative
and
the
others
kept
silent
unwilling
to
interrupt
him
at
length
he
blew
a
great
cloud
of
blue
smoke
toward
the
above
and
turning
to
the
boy
asked
did
daggs
or
any
of
the
rest
ever
speak
of
the
place
where
they
were
going
they
never
talked
about
it
openly
bob
replied
but
from
words
dropped
now
and
then
by
the
mulatto
mate
i
figured
they
were
heading
down
for
the
spanish
islands
i
do
think
they
intend
putting
in
anywhere
first
unless
they
land
for
water
in
one
of
those
out
of
the
way
inlets
along
the
jersey
coast
job
nodded
that
about
as
i
thought
he
answered
so
we
hold
on
this
tack
till
nightfall
we
just
off
the
kennebec
now
and
then
we
run
before
the
wind
to
clear
cape
cod
daggs
if
he
figgers
as
i
would
in
his
place
wo
start
to
leeward
right
away
for
he
rather
have
us
in
front
of
him
than
behind
and
unless
i
much
mistaken
he
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
waste
time
in
doubling
back
up
the
coast
all
right
bob
lad
you
be
wanting
sleep
now
so
leave
you
on
deck
with
you
boys
and
tucking
the
blankets
about
the
drowsy
youngster
in
the
bunk
job
led
the
way
to
the
companion
chapter
xxxiv
the
mist
was
sweeping
past
in
swirls
and
streaks
and
though
the
wind
had
abated
somewhat
the
still
ploughed
along
into
the
obscurity
at
a
fair
rate
of
speed
jeremy
stayed
forward
with
the
lookout
peering
constantly
into
the
gloom
ahead
and
half
expecting
to
see
the
ghostlike
sails
of
the
whenever
for
a
moment
a
gray
aisle
opened
in
the
mist
but
there
were
only
the
grim
uneasy
seas
and
the
shifting
fog
before
darkness
fell
job
shortened
sail
for
he
did
not
wish
to
get
too
far
ahead
of
the
enemy
and
about
the
end
of
the
second
dog
watch
he
gave
the
order
to
slack
sheets
and
fall
away
for
the
southward
run
the
wind
turned
bitterly
cold
in
the
night
and
when
the
watch
was
changed
tom
and
jeremy
staggered
below
glad
to
escape
from
the
stinging
snow
that
filled
the
air
but
with
that
the
weather
cleared
the
sun
rose
to
a
day
of
bright
blue
water
and
sharp
wind
and
hardly
had
its
first
level
rays
shot
across
the
ocean
floor
when
the
watch
below
was
tumbled
out
by
a
chorus
of
shouts
from
the
deck
jeremy
as
he
burst
upward
through
the
hatchway
cast
an
eager
eye
to
either
beam
then
uttered
a
whoop
of
joy
as
he
caught
the
gleam
of
white
canvas
over
the
bows
there
straight
ahead
and
barely
a
league
distant
raced
the
and
her
pirate
crew
captain
job
reached
the
deck
only
a
couple
of
jumps
behind
the
boys
and
an
instant
later
his
deep
voice
boomed
the
order
to
shake
out
all
reefs
and
set
the
bob
who
had
slept
the
clock
around
and
eaten
a
hearty
breakfast
soon
appeared
at
jeremy
side
looking
fit
for
any
adventure
with
tom
they
went
up
into
the
bows
and
were
shortly
joined
there
by
others
of
the
crew
all
intent
on
the
chase
the
swells
as
they
surged
by
from
stern
to
bow
seemed
to
move
more
and
more
sluggishly
beneath
a
press
of
sail
that
would
have
made
most
skippers
fearful
of
running
her
under
job
was
driving
the
along
at
a
terrific
pace
now
once
more
jeremy
was
proving
its
worth
job
at
the
helm
could
hold
the
plunging
schooner
on
her
course
with
far
less
danger
of
being
swung
over
into
the
trough
than
would
have
been
the
case
with
the
old
hand
tiller
but
in
spite
of
the
schooner
headlong
speed
the
distance
between
her
and
her
quarry
seemed
to
lessen
scarcely
at
all
the
old
with
her
tall
sticks
and
great
spread
of
canvas
was
flying
down
before
the
wind
with
all
the
speed
that
had
made
her
name
a
byword
and
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
was
evidently
willing
to
take
as
many
chances
as
his
pursuers
all
morning
the
chase
went
on
at
noon
when
the
winter
sun
flashed
on
the
high
white
dunes
of
cape
cod
to
starboard
the
seemed
to
have
gained
a
little
job
leaving
the
wheel
for
a
bit
came
forward
and
measured
the
distance
with
his
eye
he
shook
his
head
two
miles
he
said
at
this
rate
we
ca
get
within
range
before
dark
and
he
went
back
to
his
steering
but
for
once
he
was
mistaken
for
an
hour
or
more
the
buccaneers
had
been
hauling
over
little
by
little
toward
the
coast
possibly
with
the
idea
of
running
in
and
escaping
overland
as
soon
as
night
should
fall
now
the
lookout
in
the
foretop
of
the
gave
a
cheer
they
caught
a
flaw
in
the
wind
he
shouted
watch
us
come
up
sure
enough
the
had
sailed
into
an
area
of
light
air
to
leeward
of
the
cape
and
the
boys
could
see
that
their
own
sloop
which
still
had
the
wind
was
hauling
up
hand
over
hand
on
her
adversary
by
the
great
bull
whale
roared
job
leaping
forward
along
the
deck
now
our
chance
hold
her
as
she
is
hawkes
while
i
load
the
long
gun
the
big
worked
rapidly
as
always
but
before
he
had
done
ramming
down
the
the
pirate
schooner
was
within
range
for
a
try
she
lay
off
the
starboard
bow
almost
broadside
on
but
still
too
far
away
to
use
her
own
guns
job
aimed
with
his
usual
care
but
when
at
length
he
put
a
match
to
the
powder
the
shot
flew
harmlessly
through
the
pirate
rigging
striking
the
sea
beyond
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
wind
drew
strongly
in
the
sails
of
the
once
more
and
she
began
plunging
southward
at
a
breakneck
pace
job
ran
aft
for
a
word
with
the
mate
who
had
the
wheel
then
returned
and
again
loaded
the
bowchaser
this
time
with
chainshot
and
an
extra
heavy
charge
of
powder
to
carry
it
when
he
had
finished
he
stood
by
the
breach
in
grim
silence
watching
the
chase
it
soon
became
apparent
that
though
the
could
gain
little
on
her
rival
in
actual
headway
she
was
gradually
pulling
over
closer
to
the
quarter
of
the
hawkes
who
was
an
excellent
seaman
humored
the
craft
to
starboard
bit
by
bit
without
sacrificing
her
forward
speed
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
job
gave
a
satisfied
grunt
maneuvered
the
cannon
back
and
forth
on
its
swivel
base
once
or
twice
and
fired
above
the
roar
of
the
discharge
the
boys
heard
the
screech
of
the
whirling
chainshot
and
then
in
the
mainsail
appeared
a
great
gaping
rent
through
the
tattered
edges
of
which
the
wind
passed
unhindered
there
was
a
howl
of
joy
from
the
crew
and
without
waiting
for
an
order
they
tumbled
down
the
hatches
to
man
the
broadside
cannon
in
the
waist
job
stayed
on
deck
watching
the
enemy
through
his
handicapped
by
her
torn
mainsail
the
was
already
falling
abeam
when
they
had
hauled
up
to
within
five
or
six
hundred
yards
of
her
job

the
men
of
the

the
two

holding

at

an
even

the
captain
took
a
turn
below
where
he
looked
at

of

gave
a
few
sharp

ran

even
as

swung
into

for

there
came
the
roar
of
the

guns
and
a
shot
crashed
through
the
forestays
while
others
falling
short
threw
spray
along
the

captain
job
steady
as

broadside
and
at
his

fire
the
five
cannon
spoke
in
quick
succession
the
deck
rocked
beneath
jeremy
feet
where
he
stood
by
the
companion
ready
to
carry
job
orders
below
as
the
dense
smoke
was
swept
away
forward
on
the

they
could
see
the

further

by
the

job
at
the

time
jumping
toward
the
mainsheet
the
schooner
swung
to
starboard
heeling
sharply
as
she
caught
the
wind
abeam
and
was
in
hot
pursuit
of
her
enemy
before
a
full
minute
had
passed
chapter
xxxv
little
by
little
the
pulled
up
to
windward
of
the
buccaneer
and
the
men
below
in
the
gun
deck
could
be
heard
cheering
as
their
advance
brought
the
black
sloop
more
and
more
nearly
opposite
the
yawning
mouths
of
the
port
carronades
the
shore
was
now
less
than
half
a
mile
distant
though
making
all
possible
speed
the
pirate
schooner
seemed
to
rise
on
the
waves
with
a
more
sluggish
heave
than
before
job
watching
her
through

she

he
asked
i

quite
make
out
whether
that
a

in

planking
or
by
the
great
hook
block
see
there
now
when
she
lifts
one
of
our
shots
landed
smack
on
her
waterline
no
wonder
they
trying
to
beach
her
a
moment
later
the
had
hauled
fairly
abreast
and
the
two
schooners
plunged
along
a
bare
hundred
yards
apart
not
a
head
showed
above
the
high
weather
bulwark
of
the
only
the
muzzles
of
her
guns
peered
grimly
from
their
ports
in
her
black
side
there
was
something
sinister
about
this
apparently
deserted
ship
lurching
drunkenly
shoreward
with
her
torn
sails
and
broken
rigging
flapping
in
the
breeze
and
the
pirate
flag
flying
at
her
peak
job
made
a
megaphone
of
his
hands
and
raised
his
voice
in
a
hail
ahoy
he
boomed
will
you
surrender
peacefully
and
haul
down
that
flag
there
was
silence
for
a
full
ten
seconds
then
a
musket
cracked
and
a
bullet
imbedded
itself
in
the
mainmast
by
job
head
all
right
boys
he
said
without
moving
let
have
it
ready
port
battery
fire
jeremy
and
bob
clinging
side
by
side
to
the
felt
the
planking
quiver
under
them
at
the
series
of
mighty
discharges
and
saw
the
pirate
schooner
check
and
stagger
like
an
animal
that
has
received
its
death
wound
only
one
of
her
guns
was
able
to
reply
the
screaming
high
and
wide
but
on
she
went
and
the
steep
beach
below
the
dunes
was
very
close
now
captain
job
stood
by
the
hatchway
all
hands
up
ready
to
board
her
he
ordered
and
the
crew
swarming
on
deck
ran
to
their
places
by
the
longboat
amidships
the
was
now
in
very
shallow
water
but
job
waited
till
he
saw
the
other
craft
strike
then
bring
her
head
to
the
wind
hawkes
he
cried
and
over
with
the
boat
lads
lively
now
or
they
get
ashore
hardly
was
the
order
given
when
the
boat
shot
into
the
water
during
the
scramble
of
the
seamen
for
places
on
her
thwarts
jeremy
and
bob
jumped
down
and
crouched
in
the
bows
unseen
by
any
but
those
nearest
them
ten
seconds
after
she
hit
the
waves
the
boat
was
filled
from
gunwale
to
gunwale
with
sailors
armed
to
the
teeth
with
pistols
cutlasses
and
job
last
to
leave
the
deck
spoke
a
word
to
hawkes
who
remained
in
command
and
jumped
into
the
sternsheets
now
give
way
he
roared
the
eight
stout
oars
lashed
through
the
water
and
the
boat
sped
shoreward
like
an
arrow
up
in
the
bows
the
two
boys
clutched
their
weapons
and
waited
neither
one
would
have
admitted
that
he
was
scared
though
they
were
both
shivering
with
something
more
than
the
cold
besides
his
precious
pistol
bob
was
gripping
the
hilt
of
a
hanger
which
he
had
picked
up
from
the
pile
on
deck
in
passing
jeremy
had
been
able
to
secure
no
weapon
but
a
short
pike
with
a
heavy
ashen
staff
and
a
blade
at
the
upper
end
they
peered
over
the
bows
in
silence
the
longboat
was
close
to
the
quarter
now
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
pirates
along
her
rail
suppose
they
got
ashore
asked
bob
i
do
see
down
heads
all
it
was
job
voice
and
the
boys
together
with
many
of
the
seamen
ducked
instinctively
at
the
words
as
they
did
so
there
came
a
crash
of
musketry
followed
by
intermittent
shots
and
splinters
flew
from
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
jeremy
heard
a
gasping
cry
behind
him
and
a
young
sailor
toppled
backward
from
the
thwart
he
fell
between
the
boys
and
as
they
raised
him
in
their
arms
he
died
another
seaman
had
been
killed
and
three
more
wounded
by
the
pirate
volley
which
had
been
fired
from
a
distance
of
barely
a
dozen
yards
seeing
the
effect
of
their
fusillade
the
buccaneers
rose
cheering
and
yelling
from
behind
the
bulwarks
of
the
sloop
in
the
evident
belief
that
they
had
succeeded
in
demoralizing
the
attacking
force
but
the
speed
of
the
boat
had
hardly
been
checked
in
another
instant
the
rowers
shipped
their
oars
and
the
gunwale
scraped
along
the
of
the
schooner
a
guinea
to
the
first
man
up
cried
job
himself
reaching
up
with
powerful
fingers
for
a
grip
by
which
to
climb
there
were
no
hanging
and
as
the
in
her
stranded
position
lay
much
higher
forward
than
aft
the
boys
standing
in
the
bows
found
themselves
faced
by
smooth
planking
too
high
to
scale
jeremy
started
back
over
the
thwarts
but
heard
bob
calling
to
him
and
turned
here
a
place
to
board
the
delaware
boy
was
saying
and
pointed
toward
the
forward
which
stood
open
just
beyond
and
above
the
bow
of
the
longboat
in
a
twinkling
bob
had
straddled
through
the
hole
with
jeremy
close
after
him
it
was
dark
in
the
and
the
two
boys
made
their
way
forward
on
tiptoe
waiting
breathlessly
for
the
attack
they
felt
sure
would
come
but
apparently
all
the
buccaneers
were
busy
above
in
the
fierce
fight
that
they
could
hear
raging
along
the
rail
they
moved
on
undeterred
till
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
ladder
where
jeremy
feeling
along
the
bulkhead
uttered
an
exclamation
this
is
their
he
said
and
here
a
musket
all
loaded
and
primed
i
take
it
along
the
hatch
cover
had
been
drawn
to
but
bob
trying
it
from
beneath
decided
it
was
not
fastened
both
boys
tugged
at
it
and
succeeded
in
sliding
it
back
an
inch
or
two
where
it
stuck
the
hubbub
on
deck
was
now
terrific
they
could
hear
above
the
general
outcry
an
occasional
sharply
gasped
command
in
job
voice
or
a
snarling
oath
from
one
of
the
buccaneers
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
a
bedlam
of
unintelligible
shouts
with
a
constant
undertone
of
ringing
steel
and
the
thud
of
shifting
feet
most
of
the
firearms
apparently
had
been
discharged
and
in
the
mêlée
no
one
had
time
to
reload
bob
straining
desperately
at
the
spied
and
thrusting
it
through
the
narrow
opening
pried
with
all
his
strength
the
hatch
squeaked
open
reluctantly
and
the
boys
squirmed
through
on
to
the
deck
they
gasped
at
the
sight
which
met
their
eyes
as
they
emerged
both
of
them
had
confidently
expected
to
find
the
pirates
already
beaten
and
fighting
with
their
backs
to
the
wall
but
such
was
far
from
being
the
case
on
the
deck
amidships
lay
two
men
from
the
sorely
wounded
while
job
and
two
others
stood
at
bay
above
them
swinging
cutlasses
mightily
and
beating
off
time
after
time
the
attacks
of
a
dozen
fierce
pirate
a
number
of
buccaneers
had
fallen
but
all
who
were
unwounded
were
raging
like
a
pack
of
dogs
about
the
figures
of
job
and
his
two
supporters
they
ca
get
up
cried
bob
the
men
ca
climb
the
side
here
help
me
bring
that
rope
it
was
a
matter
of
seconds
only
before
the
boys
had
dashed
across
the
deck
and
thrown
a
rope
end
to
the
men
below
in
the
longboat
then
jeremy
turned
and
ran
toward
the
waist
another
man
was
down
now
job
and
a
single
comrade
were
fighting
back
to
back
parrying
with
red
blades
the
blows
of
half
a
score
of
the
enemy
jeremy
saw
a
gleam
of
yellow
teeth
between
wicked
lips
and
a
flash
of
light
eyes
in
the
thick
of
the
assault
then
for
a
moment
he
had
a
glimpse
of
the
whole
face
of
pharaoh
daggs
scarred
and
distorted
with
frightful
passion
a
cruel
wolf
face
and
even
as
he
looked
the
dripping
of
the
man
with
the
broken
nose
plunged
between
the
ribs
of
job
last
henchman
the
wounded
seaman
staggered
leaning
his
weight
against
his
captain
but
still
kept
his
guard
up
defending
himself
feebly
job
hooked
his
left
arm
about
the
poor
lad
body
and
backed
with
his
burden
toward
the
mainmast
slashing
fiercely
around
him
with
his
tireless
right
arm
the
while
when
they
reached
the
mast
job
leaned
his
comrade
against
it
set
his
own
back
to
the
wood
and
battled
on
but
now
a
cheer
resounded
and
the
buccaneers
turning
their
heads
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
the
rush
of
half
a
dozen
men
from
the
while
more
could
be
seen
swarming
over
the
rail
the
knot
of
pirates
broke
to
meet
the
attack
but
some
of
them
stayed
daggs
and
three
others
including
the
huge
mulatto
mate
closed
in
on
job
cutting
at
him
savagely
the
wounded
sailor
had
fainted
and
slipped
to
the
deck
jeremy
saw
the
mate
step
swiftly
to
one
side
then
come
up
from
behind
the
mast
drawing
a
long
dirk
from
his
sash
as
he
neared
job
back
he
had
lifted
the
knife
and
was
stepping
in
for
a
blow
when
jeremy
pulled
the
trigger
of
his
musket
there
must
have
been
an
extra
heavy
charge
of
powder
in
the
gun
for
its
recoil
threw
the
boy
flat
on
the
deck
and
before
he
could
regain
his
feet
he
saw
a
man
close
above
him
and
caught
the
flash
of
a
hanger
in
the
air
desperately
jeremy
rolled
out
of
the
way
and
none
too
soon
for
the
blade
cut
past
his
head
with
a
nasty
he
scrambled
up
and
caught
a
from
the
deck
as
he
did
so
the
pirate
followed
hacking
at
him
with
his
cutlass
and
for
seconds
that
seemed
like
hours
the
boy
fought
for
his
life
parrying
one
stroke
after
another
till
the
pike
shaft
was
broken
by
the
blows
and
he
was
left
weaponless
as
he
ducked
and
turned
in
despair
a
man
from
the
ran
in
and
caught
the
buccaneer
on
his
flank
finishing
him
in
short
order
the
deck
was
now
full
of
struggling
groups
for
though
a
score
of
the
longboat
crew
had
climbed
aboard
the
pirates
were
putting
up
a
fierce
resistance
jeremy
panting
from
his
encounter
cast
about
for
a
weapon
and
soon
found
a
cutlass
with
which
he
armed
himself
he
turned
toward
the
mainmast
foot
once
more
and
to
his
joy
discovered
that
his
shot
had
taken
effect
the
mulatto
had
disappeared
under
the
trampling
mass
of
fighting
men
and
job
tall
figure
still
towered
by
the
mast
it
took
the
lad
only
a
second
however
to
realize
that
his
captain
plight
was
serious
the
big
yankee
was
fighting
wearily
with
a
broken
cutlass
and
his
face
was
gray
beneath
the
red
stream
of
blood
that
ran
from
a
wound
above
his
eye
jeremy
plunged
into
the
ruck
of
the
battle
careless
now
of
danger
a
sort
of
berserk
rage
possessed
him
at
the
sight
of
that
wound
he
hewed
his
way
frantically
toward
the
mast
and
suddenly
found
bob
there
beside
him
cutting
and
lunging
like
a
demon
he
gasped
out
a
cheer
but
even
as
it
left
his
throat
the
captain
arm
flew
up
convulsively
then
dropped
out
of
sight
in
the
mob
job
down
cried
bob
wildly
but
the
new
england
boy
only
reply
was
a
sob
now
the
tables
were
turned
of
a
sudden
for
three
stout
from
the
finishing
their
first
opponents
dashed
into
the
fray
with
a
yell
and
daggs
hewing
his
way
to
the
mast
turned
to
face
the
new
attack
with
only
two
men
left
on
foot
to
back
him
the
fight
was
short
and
fierce
first
one
then
the
other
of
the
buccaneers
went
down
before
the
furious
assault
of
job
seamen
at
length
only
the
pirate
chief
was
left
to
battle
on
terrible
and
silent
his
face
set
in
a
ghastly
grin
like
the
visage
of
a
lone
wolf
fighting
his
last
fight
but
the
odds
were
too
great
the
men
of
the
pressed
in
relentlessly
till
at
last
a
dozen
found
their
mark
at
once
and
so
died
pharaoh
daggs
violently
as
he
had
lived
chapter
xxxvi
it
was
jeremy
who
five
minutes
later
held
job
head
on
his
knees
while
the
weary
bleeding
sailors
stood
silently
by
with
their
hats
off
the
a
grizzled
veteran
of
many
was
kneeling
beside
his
captain
with
an
ear
to
his
side
there
was
hope
in
the
man
face
when
at
length
he
looked
up
he
breathin
yet
was
his
verdict
breathin
but
not
much
more
there
half
a
score
of
cuts
in
him
different
places
here
lads
rig
a
stretcher
an
let
get
him
back
to
the
ship
when
the
unconscious
body
of
their
big
friend
had
been
placed
gently
in
the
boat
bob
and
jeremy
turned
to
each
other
with
sober
faces
it
was
a
costly
sort
of
victory
said
bob
this
deck
not
a
pretty
sight
and
there
nothing
much
we
can
do
to
help
let
have
a
look
at
the
cabin
they
went
below
and
forced
open
the
door
of
the
after
compartment
which
had
once
housed
the
great
stede
bonnet
instead
of
its
old
immaculate
and
almost
scholarly
appearance
the
place
now
had
an
air
of
desolation
it
reeked
of
filth
stale
and
the
spilled
lees
of
liquor
in
the
clutter
on
the
cabin
table
lay
two
bulging
sacks
and
a
small
box
well
said
bob
as
he
felt
the
weight
of
one
of
the
bags
here
the
rest
of
brig
gold
but
jeremy
attention
was
occupied
he
had
picked
up
the
box
from
the
table
and
was
examining
it
curiously
see
here
bob
he
cried
this
is
the
little
chest
i
was
carrying
the
night
we
ran
through
the
woods
i
dropped
it
when
that
pirate
tackled
me
what
do
you
suppose
is
in
it
the
box
was
and
heavily
studded
with
nails
jeremy
tried
the
small
padlock
and
found
it
rusty
and
weak
a
hard
pull
on
the
staple
and
it
came
away
in
his
hand
he
threw
open
the
cover
and
the
two
boys
stood
back
gasping
with
astonishment
there
on
the
lining
of
soft
buckskin
lay
twelve
great
emeralds
gleaming
with
a
clear
green
light
even
in
that
dark
place
they
were
perfectly
matched
and
as
large
as
the
end
of
a
man
thumb
each
cut
in
a
square
pattern
after
the
oldtime
fashion
such
stones
they
were
as
could
have
come
only
from
the
coffers
of
an
oriental
king
the
ransom
perhaps
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
or
of
the
favorite
wife
of
some
maharajah
seized
in
one
of
solomon
brig
daredevil
raids
bob
found
breath
at
last
it
a
fortune
he
cried
they
worth
more
than
all
the
gold
together
and
they
yours
jeremy
yours
by
right
of
discovery
twice
over
you
rich
you
and
your
father
and
tom
think
of
it
you
can
buy
a
whole
fleet
of
big
ships
like
the
and
become
a
great
merchant
you
and
i
be
partners
when
we
grown
up
jubilant
he
picked
up
one
of
the
sacks
of
gold
and
made
his
way
to
the
deck
followed
by
the
jeremy
who
carried
the
rest
of
the
treasure
the
sun
was
close
to
setting
when
the
boat
made
its
last
trip
to
the
pirate
sloop
this
time
its
errand
was
a
sad
one
silently
the
crew
passed
long
limp
bundles
across
the
rail
rowed
with
them
to
the
beach
and
clambered
up
the
desolate
dunes
with
picks
and
shovels
in
their
hands
there
where
the
wind
moaned
in
the
thickets
and
the
white
gulls
wheeled
and
screamed
they
dug
a
long
grave
and
laid
the
dead
to
rest
pirates
and
honest
men
together
under
the
wintry
sky
the
boat
returned
and
was
hoisted
aboard
just
as
the
mainsail
had
been
run
up
and
the
schooner
was
filling
away
for
her
northward
beat
a
single
shout
from
the
crosstrees
caused
every
man
to
turn
his
gaze
shoreward
into
the
gathering
dark
a
faint
glow
seemed
to
hang
in
the
air
above
the
pirate
sloop
a
little
snaky
flame
wriggled
its
way
along
a
piece
of
sagging
cordage
licked
at
the
edges
of
a
torn
sail
and
flared
outward
in
a
burst
of
red
fire
a
moment
later
and
the
whole
schooner
was
ablaze
from
waterline
to
masthead
jeremy
watching
fascinated
from
the
rail
thought
of
the
night
when
he
had
first
seen
that
black
hull
and
of
the
burning
brig
that
had
lit
up
the
sky
as
the
pirate
sloop
now
illumined
it
her
fate
was
the
same
that
she
had
meted
out
to
many
a
good
ship
they
were
rapidly
drawing
away
now
the
great
glare
of
the
burning
schooner
faded
out
as
the
flame
devoured
her
fabric
the
foremast
toppled
and
fell
in
a
shower
of
sparks
the
mainmast
followed
only
a
feeble
light
flickered
along
the
edges
of
the
hulk
the
faint
gleam
of
it
was
visible
astern
for
some
time
before
it
was
swallowed
by
the
dark
sea
the
was
gone
this
is
the
end
of
my
story
of
the
voyage
to
boston
town
of
how
job
was
nursed
back
to
health
by
phineas
whipple
the
best
surgeon
in
all
the
colonies
of
the
glorious
reunion
when
amos
swan
and
clarke
curtis
rejoined
their
sons
of
the
many
pleasant
things
that
bob
and
jeremy
found
to
do
together
after
the
swans
had
come
to
live
in
philadelphia
of
all
these
things
there
is
not
space
enough
in
this
book
for
me
to
tell
jeremy
swan
grew
up
to
be
one
of
the
great
americans
of
his
day
a
man
strong
wise
and
independent
and
although
he
became
rich
and
highly
honored
he
never
lost
the
simplicity
of
his
ways
sometimes
when
he
was
a
hale
old
man
of
seventy
he
would
take
his
grandson
who
was
named
job
cantwell
swan
on
his
knee
and
tell
him
stories
but
the
story
that
young
job
loved
best
to
hear
and
that
old
jeremy
loved
best
to
tell
was
about
a
boy
in
deerskin
breeches
and
the
wild
days
and
nights
he
saw
aboard
the
black
