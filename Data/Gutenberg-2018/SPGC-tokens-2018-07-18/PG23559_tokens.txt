there
is
a
golden
thread
that
runs
through
every
religion
in
the

there
is
a
golden
thread
that
runs
through
the
lives
and
the
teachings
of
all
the
prophets

and

in

history
through
the

of
all

of

all
that
they
have
ever

to
has
been
done
in
full
accordance
with

what
one
has
done
all
may
do
this
same
golden
thread
must
enter
into
the
lives
of
all
who
today
in
this
busy
world
of
ours
would
exchange
impotence
for
power
weakness
and
suffering
for
abounding
health
and
strength
pain
and
unrest
for
perfect
peace
poverty
of
whatever
nature
for
fullness
and
plenty
each
is
building
his
own
world
we
both
build
from
within
and
we
attract
from
without
thought
is
the
force
with
which
we
build
for
thoughts
are
forces
like
builds
like
and
like
attracts
like
in
the
degree
that
thought
is
spiritualized
does
it
become
more
subtle
and
powerful
in
its
workings
this
spiritualizing
is
in
accordance
with
law
and
is
within
the
power
of
all
everything
is
first
worked
out
in
the
unseen
before
it
is
manifested
in
the
seen
in
the
ideal
before
it
is
realized
in
the
real
in
the
spiritual
before
it
shows
forth
in
the
material
the
realm
of
the
unseen
is
the
realm
of
cause
the
realm
of
the
seen
is
the
realm
of
effect
the
nature
of
effect
is
always
determined
and
conditioned
by
the
nature
of
its
cause
to
point
out
the
great
facts
in

with
and
the
great
laws
underlying
the

of
the

forces
to
point
them
out
so
simply

that
even
a

the
author
aim
to
point
them
out
so
simply
and
so
clearly
that
all
can
grasp
them
that
all
can
take
them
and
infuse
them
into
life
so
as
to
mould
it
in
all
its
details
in
accordance
with
what
they
would
have
it
is
his
purpose
that
life
can
be
thus
moulded
by
them
is
not
a
matter
of
mere
speculation
or
theory
with
him
but
a
matter
of
positive
knowledge
there
is
a
divine
sequence
running
throughout
the
universe
within
and
above
and
below
the
human
will
incessantly
works
the
divine
will
to
come
into
harmony
with
it
and
thereby
with
all
the

to
come
then
into

and
to
work
in

with
them
in

that
they
can
work
in

entering
now
into
the
realization
of
the
highest
riches
fullness
of
peace
power
and
plenty
prelude
the
optimist
is
right
the
pessimist
is
right
the
one
differs
from
the
other
as
the
light
from
the
dark
yet
both
are
right
each
is
right
from
his
own
particular
point
of
view
and
this
point
of
view
is
the
determining
factor
in
the
life
of
each
it
determines
as
to
whether
it
is
a
life
of
power
or
of
impotence
of
peace
or
of
pain
of
success
or
of
failure
the
optimist
has
the
power
of
seeing
things
in
their
entirety
and
in
their
right
relations
the
pessimist
looks
from
a
limited
and
a
point
of
view
the
one
has
his
understanding
illumined
by
wisdom
the
understanding
of
the
other
is
darkened
by
ignorance
each
is
building
his
world
from
within
and
the
result
of
the
building
is
determined
by
the
point
of
view
of
each
the
optimist
by
his
superior
wisdom
and
insight
is
making
his
own
heaven
and
in
the
degree
that
he
makes
his
own
heaven
is
he
helping
to
make
one
for
all
the
world
beside
the
pessimist
by
virtue
of
his
limitations
is
making
his
own
hell
and
in
the
degree
that
he
makes
his
own
hell
is
he
helping
to
make
one
for
all
mankind
you
and
i
have
the
predominating
characteristics
of
an
optimist
or
the
predominating
characteristics
of
a
pessimist
we
then
are
making
hour
by
hour
our
own
heaven
or
our
own
hell
and
in
the
degree
that
we
are
making
the
one
or
the
other
for
ourselves
are
we
helping
make
it
for
all
the
world
beside
the
word
heaven
means
harmony
the
word
hell
is
from
the
old
english
meaning
to
build
a
wall
around
to
separate
to
be
was
to
be
shut
off
from
now
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
harmony
there
must
be
that
something
one
can
be
in
right
relations
with
for
to
be
in
right
relations
with
anything
is
to
be
in
harmony
with
it
again
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
being
shut
off
separated
from
there
must
be
that
something
from
which
one
is
held
shut
off
or
separated
the
supreme
fact
of
the
universe
the
great
central
fact
of
the
universe
is
that
spirit
of
infinite
life
and
power
that
is
behind
all
that
animates
all
that
manifests
itself
in
and
through
all
that
principle
of
life
from
which
all
has
come
and
not
only
from
which
all
has
come
but
from
which
all
is
continually
coming
if
there
is
an
individual
life
there
must
of
necessity
be
an
infinite
source
of
life
from
which
it
comes
if
there
is
a
quality
or
a
force
of
love
there
must
of
necessity
be
an
infinite
source
of
love
whence
it
comes
if
there
is
wisdom
there
must
be
the
source
behind
it
from
which
it
springs
the
same
is
true
in
regard
to
peace
the
same
in
regard
to
power
the
same
in
regard
to
what
we
call
material
things
there
is
then
this
spirit
of
infinite
life
and
power
behind
all
which
is
the
source
of
all
this
infinite
power
is
creating
working
ruling
through
the
agency
of
great
immutable
laws
and
forces
that
run
through
all
the
universe
that
surround
us
on
every
side
every
act
of
our
lives
is
governed
by
these
same
great
laws
and
forces
every
flower
that
blooms
by
the
wayside
springs
up
grows
blooms
fades
according
to
certain
great
immutable
laws
every
snowflake
that
plays
between
earth
and
heaven
forms
falls
melts
according
to
certain
great
unchangeable
laws
in
a
sense
there
is
nothing
in
all
the
great
universe
but
law
if
this
is
true
there
must
of
necessity
be
a
force
behind
it
all
that
is
the
maker
of
these
laws
and
a
force
greater
than
the
laws
that
are
made
this
spirit
of
infinite
life
and
power
that
is
behind
all
is
what
i
call
god
i
care
not
what
term
you
may
use
be
it
kindly
light
providence
the
over
soul
omnipotence
or
whatever
term
may
be
most
convenient
i
care
not
what
the
term
may
be
as
long
as
we
are
agreed
in
regard
to
the
great
central
fact
itself
god
then
is
this
infinite
spirit
which
fills
all
the
universe
with
himself
alone
so
that
all
is
from
him
and
in
him
and
there
is
nothing
that
is
outside
indeed
and
in
truth
then
in
him
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
he
is
the
life
of
our
life
our
very
life
itself
we
have
received
we
are
continually
receiving
our
life
from
him
we
are
partakers
of
the
life
of
god
and
though
we
differ
from
him
in
that
we
are
individualized
spirits
while
he
is
the
infinite
spirit
including
us
as
well
as
all
else
beside
in
essence
the
life
of
god
and
the
life
of
man
are
identically
the
same
and
so
are
they
differ
not
in
essence
in
quality
they
differ
in
degree
there
have
been
and
are
highly
illumined
souls
who
believe
that
we
receive
our
life
from
god
after
the
manner
of
a
divine
inflow
and
again
there
have
been
and
are
those
who
believe
that
our
life
is
one
with
the
life
of
god
and
so
that
god
and
man
are
one
which
is
right
both
are
right
both
right
when
rightly
understood
in
regard
to
the
first
if
god
is
the
infinite
spirit
of
life
behind
all
whence
all
comes
then
clearly
our
life
as
individualized
spirits
is
continually
coming
from
this
infinite
source
by
means
of
this
divine
inflow
in
the
second
place
if
our
lives
as
individualized
spirits
are
directly
from
are
parts
of
this
infinite
spirit
of
life
then
the
degree
of
the
infinite
spirit
that
is
manifested
in
the
life
of
each
must
be
identical
in
quality
with
that
source
the
same
as
a
drop
of
water
taken
from
the
ocean
is
in
nature
in
characteristics
identical
with
that
ocean
its
source
and
how
could
it
be
otherwise
the
liability
to
misunderstanding
in
this
latter
case
however
is
this
in
that
although
the
life
of
god
and
the
life
of
man
in
essence
are
identically
the
same
the
life
of
god
so
far
transcends
the
life
of
individual
man
that
it
includes
all
else
beside
in
other
words
so
far
as
the
quality
of
life
is
concerned
in
essence
they
are
the
same
so
far
as
the
degree
of
life
is
concerned
they
are
vastly
different
in
this
light
is
it
not
then
evident
that
both
conceptions
are
true
and
more
that
they
are
one
and
the
same
both
conceptions
may
be
typified
by
one
and
the
same
illustration
there
is
a
reservoir
in
a
valley
which
receives
its
supply
from
an
inexhaustible
reservoir
on
the
mountain
side
it
is
then
true
that
the
reservoir
in
the
valley
receives
its
supply
by
virtue
of
the
inflow
of
the
water
from
the
larger
reservoir
on
the
mountain
side
it
is
also
true
that
the
water
in
this
smaller
reservoir
is
in
nature
in
quality
in
characteristics
identically
the
same
as
that
in
the
larger
reservoir
which
is
its
source
the
difference
however
is
this
the
reservoir
on
the
mountain
side
in
the
of
its
water
so
far
transcends
the
reservoir
in
the
valley
that
it
can
supply
an
innumerable
number
of
like
reservoirs
and
still
be
unexhausted
and
so
in
the
life
of
man
if
as
i
think
we
have
already
agreed
however
we
may
differ
in
regard
to
anything
else
there
is
this
infinite
spirit
of
life
behind
all
the
life
of
all
and
so
from
which
all
comes
then
the
life
of
individual
man
your
life
and
mine
must
come
by
a
divine
inflow
from
this
infinite
source
and
if
this
is
true
then
the
life
that
comes
by
this
inflow
to
man
is
necessarily
the
same
in
essence
as
is
this
infinite
spirit
of
life
there
is
a
difference
it
is
not
a
difference
in
essence
it
is
a
difference
in
degree
if
this
is
true
does
it
not
then
follow
that
in
the
degree
that
man
opens
himself
to
this
divine
inflow
does
he
approach
to
god
if
so
it
then
necessarily
follows
that
in
the
degree
that
he
makes
this
approach
does
he
take
on
the
and
if
the
are
without
limit
does
it
not
then
follow
that
the
only
limitations
man
has
are
the
limitations
he
sets
to
himself
by
virtue
of
not
knowing
himself
the
supreme
fact
of
human
life
from
the
great
central
fact
of
the
universe
in
regard
to
which
we
have
agreed
namely
this
spirit
of
infinite
life
that
is
behind
all
and
from
which
all
comes
we
are
led
to
inquire
as
to
what
is
the
great
central
fact
in
human
life
from
what
has
gone
before
the
question
almost
answers
itself
great
central
fact
in
human
life
in
your
life
and
in
mine
is
the
coming
into
a
conscious
vital
realization
of
our
oneness
with
this
infinite
life
and
the
opening
of
ourselves
fully
to
this
divine
this
is
the
great
central
fact
in
human
life
for
in
this
all
else
is
included
all
else
follows
in
its
train
in
just
the
degree
that
we
come
into
a
conscious
realization
of
our
oneness
with
the
infinite
life
and
open
ourselves
to
this
divine
inflow
do
we
actualize
in
ourselves
the
qualities
and
powers
of
the
infinite
life
and
what
does
this
mean
it
means
simply
this
that
we
are
recognizing
our
true
identity
that
we
are
bringing
our
lives
into
harmony
with
the
same
great
laws
and
forces
and
so
opening
ourselves
to
the
same
great
inspirations
as
have
all
the
prophets
seers
sages
and
saviours
in
the
world
history
all
men
of
truly
great
and
mighty
power
for
in
the
degree
that
we
come
into
this
realization
and
connect
ourselves
with
this
infinite
source
do
we
make
it
possible
for
the
higher
powers
to
play
to
work
to
manifest
through
us
we
can
keep
closed
to
this
divine
inflow
to
these
higher
forces
and
powers
through
ignorance
as
most
of
us
do
and
thus
hinder
or
even
prevent
their
manifesting
through
us
or
we
can
intentionally
close
ourselves
to
their
operations
and
thus
deprive
ourselves
of
the
powers
to
which
by
the
very
nature
of
our
being
we
are
rightful
heirs
on
the
other
hand
we
can
come
into
so
vital
a
realization
of
the
oneness
of
our
real
selves
with
this
infinite
life
and
can
open
ourselves
so
fully
to
the
incoming
of
this
divine
inflow
and
so
to
the
operation
of
these
higher
forces
inspirations
and
powers
that
we
can
indeed
and
in
truth
become
what
we
may
well
term
and
what
is
a
one
in
whom
the
powers
of
god
are
manifesting
though
yet
a
man
no
one
can
set
limitations
to
a
man
or
a
woman
of
this
type
for
the
only
limitations
he
or
she
can
have
are
those
set
by
the
self
ignorance
is
the
most
potent
factor
in
setting
limitations
to
the
majority
of
mankind
and
so
the
great
majority
of
people
continue
to
live
their
little
dwarfed
and
stunted
lives
simply
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
do
not
realize
the
larger
life
to
which
they
are
heirs
they
have
never
as
yet
come
into
a
knowledge
of
the
real
identity
of
their
true
selves
mankind
has
not
yet
realized
that
the
real
self
is
one
with
the
life
of
god
through
its
ignorance
it
has
never
yet
opened
itself
to
the
divine
inflow
and
so
has
never
made
itself
a
channel
through
which
the
infinite
powers
and
forces
can
manifest
when
we
know
ourselves
merely
as
men
we
live
accordingly
and
have
merely
the
powers
of
men
when
we
come
into
the
realization
of
the
fact
that
we
are
then
again
we
live
accordingly
and
have
the
powers
of
the
degree
that
we
open
ourselves
to
this
divine
inflow
are
we
changed
from
mere
men
into
a
friend
has
a
beautiful
lotus
pond
a
natural
basin
on
his
estate
his
farm
as
he
always
calls
it
is
supplied
with
water
from
a
reservoir
in
the
foothills
some
distance
away
a
gate
regulates
the
flow
of
the
water
from
the
main
that
conducts
it
from
the
reservoir
to
the
pond
it
is
a
spot
of
transcendent
beauty
there
through
the
days
of
the
perfect
summer
weather
the
lotus
flowers
lie
full
blown
upon
the
surface
of
the
clear
transparent
water
the
june
roses
and
other
wild
flowers
are
continually
blooming
upon
its
banks
the
birds
come
here
to
drink
and
to
bathe
and
from
early
until
late
one
can
hear
the
melody
of
their
song
the
bees
are
continually
at
work
in
this
garden
of
wild
flowers
a
beautiful
grove
in
which
many
kinds
of
wild
berries
and
many
varieties
of
brakes
and
ferns
grow
stretches
back
of
the
pond
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
our
friend
is
a
man
nay
more
a
a
lover
of
his
kind
and
as
a
consequence
no
notice
bearing
such
words
as
private
grounds
no
trespassing
allowed
or
trespassers
will
be
prosecuted
stands
on
his
estate
but
at
the
end
of
a
beautiful
that
leads
through
the
wildwood
up
to
this
enchanting
spot
stands
a
notice
bearing
the
words
all
are
welcome
to
the
lotus
pond
all
love
our
friend
why
they
ca
help
it
he
so
loves
them
and
what
is
his
is
theirs
here
one
may
often
find
merry
groups
of
children
at
play
here
many
times
tired
and
weary
looking
men
and
women
come
and
somehow
when
they
go
their
faces
wear
a
different
expression
the
burden
seems
to
be
lifted
and
now
and
then
i
have
heard
them
when
leaving
sometimes
in
a
faint
murmur
as
if
uttering
a
benediction
say
god
bless
our
many
speak
of
this
spot
as
the
garden
of
god
my
friend
calls
it
his
soul
garden
and
he
spends
many
hours
in
quiet
here
often
have
i
seen
him
after
the
others
have
gone
walking
to
and
fro
or
sitting
quietly
in
the
clear
moonlight
on
an
old
rustic
bench
drinking
in
the
perfume
of
the
wild
flowers
he
is
a
man
of
a
beautifully
simple
nature
he
says
that
here
the
real
things
of
life
come
to
him
and
that
here
his
greatest
and
most
successful
plans
many
times
as
by
a
flash
of
inspiration
suggest
themselves
to
him
everything
in
the
immediate
vicinity
seems
to
breathe
a
spirit
of
kindliness
comfort
and
good
cheer
the
very
cattle
and
sheep
as
they
come
to
the
old
at
the
edge
of
the
grove
and
look
across
to
this
beautiful
spot
seem
indeed
to
get
the
same
enjoyment
that
the
people
are
getting
they
seem
almost
to
smile
in
the
realization
of
their
contentment
and
enjoyment
or
perhaps
it
seems
so
to
the
because
he
can
scarcely
help
smiling
as
he
sees
the
manifested
evidence
of
their
contentment
and
pleasure
the
gate
of
the
pond
is
always
open
wide
enough
to
admit
a
supply
of
water
so
abundant
that
it
continually
overflows
a
quantity
sufficient
to
feed
a
stream
that
runs
through
the
fields
below
giving
the
pure
mountain
water
in
drink
to
the
cattle
and
flocks
that
are
grazing
there
the
stream
then
flows
on
through
the
neighbors
fields
not
long
ago
our
friend
was
absent
for
a
year
he
rented
his
estate
during
his
absence
to
a
man
who
as
the
world
goes
was
of
a
very
practical
turn
of
mind
he
had
no
time
for
anything
that
did
not
bring
him
direct
practical
returns
the
gate
connecting
the
reservoir
with
the
lotus
pond
was
shut
down
and
no
longer
had
the
crystal
mountain
water
the
opportunity
to
feed
and
overflow
it
the
notice
of
our
friend
all
are
welcome
to
the
lotus
pond
was
removed
and
no
longer
were
the
gay
companies
of
children
and
of
men
and
women
seen
at
the
pond
a
great
change
came
over
everything
on
account
of
the
lack
of
the
water
the
flowers
in
the
pond
wilted
and
their
long
stems
lay
stretched
upon
the
mud
in
the
bottom
the
fish
that
formerly
swam
in
its
clear
water
soon
died
and
gave
an
offensive
odor
to
all
who
came
near
the
flowers
no
longer
bloomed
on
its
banks
the
birds
no
longer
came
to
drink
and
to
bathe
no
longer
was
heard
the
hum
of
the
bees
and
more
the
stream
that
ran
through
the
fields
below
dried
up
so
that
the
cattle
and
the
flocks
no
longer
got
their
supply
of
clear
mountain
water
the
difference
between
the
spot
now
and
the
lotus
pond
when
our
friend
gave
it
his
careful
attention
was
caused
as
we
readily
see
by
the
shutting
of
the
gate
to
the
pond
thus
preventing
the
water
from
the
reservoir
in
the
hills
which
was
the
source
of
its
life
from
entering
it
and
when
this
the
source
of
its
life
was
shut
off
not
only
was
the
appearance
of
the
lotus
pond
entirely
changed
but
the
surrounding
fields
were
deprived
of
the
stream
to
whose
banks
the
flocks
and
cattle
came
for
drink
in
this
do
we
not
see
a
complete
parallel
so
far
as
human
life
is
concerned
in
the
degree
that
we
recognize
our
oneness
our
connection
with
the
infinite
spirit
which
is
the
life
of
all
and
in
the
degree
that
we
open
ourselves
to
this
divine
inflow
do
we
come
into
harmony
with
the
highest
the
most
powerful
and
the
most
beautiful
everywhere
and
in
the
degree
that
we
do
this
do
we
overflow
so
that
all
who
come
in
contact
with
us
receive
the
effects
of
this
realization
on
our
part
this
is
the
lotus
pond
of
our
friend
he
who
is
in
love
with
all
that
is
truest
and
best
in
the
universe
and
in
the
degree
that
we
fail
to
recognize
our
oneness
with
this
infinite
source
and
so
close
shut
ourselves
to
this
divine
inflow
do
we
come
into
that
state
where
there
seems
to
be
with
us
nothing
of
good
nothing
of
beauty
nothing
of
power
and
when
this
is
true
those
who
come
in
contact
with
us
receive
not
good
but
harm
this
is
the
spot
of
the
lotus
pond
while
the
farm
was
in
the
hands
of
a
renter
there
is
this
difference
between
the
lotus
pond
and
your
life
and
mine
it
has
no
power
in
itself
of
opening
the
gate
to
the
inflow
of
the
water
from
the
reservoir
which
is
its
source
in
regard
to
this
it
is
helpless
and
dependent
upon
an
outside
agency
you
and
i
have
the
power
the
power
within
us
to
open
or
to
close
ourselves
to
this
divine
inflow
exactly
as
we
choose
this
we
have
through
the
power
of
mind
through
the
operation
of
thought
there
is
the
soul
life
direct
from
god
this
it
is
that
relates
us
to
the
infinite
there
is
then
the
physical
life
this
it
is
that
relates
us
to
the
material
universe
about
us
the
thought
life
connects
the
one
with
the
other
it
is
this
that
plays
between
the
two
before
we
proceed
farther
let
us
consider
very
briefly
the
nature
of
thought
thought
is
not
as
is
many
times
supposed
a
mere
indefinite
abstraction
or
something
of
a
like
nature
it
is
on
the
contrary
a
vital
living
force
the
most
vital
subtle
and
irresistible
force
there
is
in
the
universe
in
our
very
laboratory
experiments
we
are
demonstrating
the
great
fact
that
thoughts
are
forces
they
have
form
and
quality
and
substance
and
power
and
we
are
beginning
to
find
that
there
is
what
we
may
term
a
of
we
are
beginning
also
to
find
that
through
the
instrumentality
of
our
thought
forces
we
have
creative
power
not
merely
in
a
figurative
sense
but
creative
power
in
reality
everything
in
the
material
universe
about
us
everything
the
universe
has
ever
known
had
its
origin
first
in
thought
from
this
it
took
its
form
every
castle
every
statue
every
painting
every
piece
of
mechanism
everything
had
its
birth
its
origin
first
in
the
mind
of
the
one
who
formed
it
before
it
received
its
material
expression
or
embodiment
the
very
universe
in
which
we
live
is
the
result
of
the
thought
energies
of
god
the
infinite
spirit
that
is
back
of
all
and
if
it
is
true
as
we
have
found
that
we
in
our
true
selves
are
in
essence
the
same
and
in
this
sense
are
one
with
the
life
of
this
infinite
spirit
do
we
not
then
see
that
in
the
degree
that
we
come
into
a
vital
realization
of
this
stupendous
fact
through
the
operation
of
our
interior
spiritual
thought
forces
have
in
like
sense
creative
everything
exists
in
the
unseen
before
it
is
manifested
or
realized
in
the
seen
and
in
this
sense
it
is
true
that
the
unseen
things
are
the
real
while
the
things
that
are
seen
are
the
unreal
the
unseen
things
are
the
seen
things
are
the
unseen
things
are
the
eternal
the
seen
things
are
the
changing
the
transient
the
of
the
is
a
literal
scientific
fact
through
the
operation
of
our
thought
forces
we
have
creative
power
the
spoken
word
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
outward
expression
of
the
workings
of
these
interior
forces
the
spoken
word
is
then
in
a
sense
the
means
whereby
the
thought
forces
are
focused
and
directed
along
any
particular
line
and
this
concentration
this
giving
them
direction
is
necessary
before
any
outward
or
material
manifestation
of
their
power
can
become
evident
much
is
said
in
regard
to
building
castles
in
the
air
and
one
who
is
given
to
this
building
is
not
always
looked
upon
with
favor
but
castles
in
the
air
are
always
necessary
before
we
can
have
castles
on
the
ground
before
we
can
have
castles
in
which
to
live
the
trouble
with
the
one
who
gives
himself
to
building
castles
in
the
air
is
not
that
he
builds
them
in
the
air
but
that
he
does
not
go
farther
and
actualize
in
life
in
character
in
material
form
the
castles
he
thus
builds
he
does
a
part
of
the
work
a
very
necessary
part
but
another
equally
necessary
part
remains
still
undone
there
is
in
connection
with
the
thought
forces
what
we
may
term
the
drawing
power
of
mind
and
the
great
law
operating
here
is
one
with
that
great
law
of
the
universe
that
like
attracts
like
we
are
continually
attracting
to
us
from
both
the
seen
and
the
unseen
side
of
life
forces
and
conditions
most
akin
to
those
of
our
own
thoughts
this
law
is
continually
operating
whether
we
are
conscious
of
it
or
not
we
are
all
living
so
to
speak
in
a
vast
ocean
of
thought
and
the
very
atmosphere
around
us
is
continually
filled
with
the
thought
forces
that
are
being
continually
sent
or
that
are
continually
going
out
in
the
form
of
thought
waves
we
are
all
affected
more
or
less
by
these
thought
forces
either
consciously
or
unconsciously
and
in
the
degree
that
we
are
more
or
less
sensitively
organized
or
in
the
degree
that
we
are
negative
and
so
are
open
to
outside
influences
rather
than
positive
thus
determining
what
influences
shall
enter
into
our
realm
of
thought
and
hence
into
our
lives
there
are
those
among
us
who
are
much
more
sensitively
organized
than
others
as
an
organism
their
bodies
are
more
finely
more
sensitively
constructed
these
generally
speaking
are
people
who
are
always
more
or
less
affected
by
the
mentalities
of
those
with
whom
they
come
in
contact
or
in
whose
company
they
are
a
friend
the
editor
of
one
of
our
great
journals
is
so
sensitively
organized
that
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
attend
a
gathering
such
as
a
reception
talk
and
shake
hands
with
a
number
of
people
during
the
course
of
the
evening
without
taking
on
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
their
various
mental
and
physical
conditions
these
affect
him
to
such
an
extent
that
he
is
scarcely
himself
and
in
his
best
condition
for
work
until
some
two
or
three
days
afterward
some
think
it
unfortunate
for
one
to
be
sensitively
organized
by
no
means
it
is
a
good
thing
for
one
may
thus
be
more
open
and
receptive
to
the
higher
impulses
of
the
soul
within
and
to
all
higher
forces
and
influences
from
without
it
may
however
be
unfortunate
and
extremely
inconvenient
to
be
so
organized
unless
one
recognize
and
gain
the
power
of
closing
himself
of
making
himself
positive
to
all
detrimental
or
undesirable
influences
this
power
every
one
however
sensitively
organized
he
may
be
can
acquire
this
he
can
acquire
through
the
mind
action
and
moreover
there
is
no
habit
of
more
value
to
anyone
be
he
sensitively
or
less
sensitively
organized
than
that
of
occasionally
taking
and
holding
himself
continually
in
the
attitude
of
mind
i
close
myself
i
make
myself
positive
to
all
things
below
and
open
and
receptive
to
all
higher
influences
to
all
things
above
by
taking
this
attitude
of
mind
consciously
now
and
then
it
soon
becomes
a
habit
and
if
one
is
deeply
in
earnest
in
regard
to
it
it
puts
into
operation
silent
but
subtle
and
powerful
influences
in
effecting
the
desired
results
in
this
way
all
lower
and
undesirable
influences
from
both
the
seen
and
the
unseen
side
of
life
are
closed
out
while
all
higher
influences
are
invited
and
in
the
degree
that
they
are
invited
will
they
enter
and
what
do
we
mean
by
the
unseen
side
of
life
first
the
thought
forces
the
mental
and
emotional
conditions
in
the
atmosphere
about
us
that
are
generated
by
those
manifesting
on
the
physical
plane
through
the
agency
of
physical
bodies
second
the
same
forces
generated
by
those
who
have
dropped
the
physical
body
or
from
whom
it
has
been
struck
away
and
who
are
now
manifesting
through
the
agency
of
bodies
of
a
different
nature
the
individual
existence
of
man
on
the
sense
plane
of
the
physical
world
but
rises
through
successive
gradations
of
ethereal
and
celestial
spheres
corresponding
with
his
ever
unfolding
deific
life
and
powers
to
a
destiny
of
unspeakable
grandeur
and
glory
within
and
above
every
physical
planet
is
a
corresponding
ethereal
planet
or
soul
world
as
within
and
above
every
physical
organism
is
a
corresponding
ethereal
organism
or
soul
body
of
which
the
physical
is
but
the
external
counterpart
and
materialized
expression
from
this
etherealized
or
soul
planet
which
is
the
immediate
home
of
our
arisen
humanity
there
rises
or
deepens
in
infinite
gradations
spheres
within
and
above
spheres
to
celestial
heights
of
spiritualized
existence
utterly
inconceivable
to
the
sense
man
embodiment
accordingly
is
the
physical
being
but
the
temporary
husk
so
to
speak
in
and
by
which
the
real
and
permanent
ethereal
organism
is
individualized
and
perfected
somewhat
as
full
corn
in
the
ear
is
reached
by
means
of
its
husk
for
which
there
is
no
further
use
by
means
of
this
indestructible
ethereal
body
and
the
corresponding
ethereal
spheres
of
environment
with
the
social
life
and
relations
in
the
spheres
the
individuality
and
personal
life
is
preserved
forever
the
fact
of
life
in
whatever
form
means
the
continuance
of
life
even
though
the
form
be
changed
life
is
the
one
eternal
principle
of
the
universe
and
so
always
continues
even
though
the
form
of
the
agency
through
which
it
manifests
be
changed
in
my
father
house
are
many
mansions
and
surely
because
the
individual
has
dropped
has
gone
out
of
the
physical
body
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
the
life
does
not
go
right
on
the
same
as
before
not
commencing
for
there
is
no
cessation
but
commencing
in
the
other
form
exactly
where
it
has
left
off
here
for
all
life
is
a
continuous
evolution
step
by
step
there
one
neither
skips
nor
jumps
there
are
in
the
other
form
then
mentalities
and
hence
lives
of
all
grades
and
influences
the
same
as
there
are
in
the
physical
form
if
then
the
great
law
that
like
attracts
like
is
ever
operating
we
are
continually
attracting
to
us
from
this
side
of
life
influences
and
conditions
most
akin
to
those
of
our
own
thoughts
and
lives
a
grewsome
thought
that
we
should
be
so
influenced
says
one
by
no
means
all
life
is
one
we
are
all
bound
together
in
the
one
common
and
universal
life
and
especially
not
when
we
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
we
have
it
entirely
in
our
own
hands
to
determine
the
order
of
thought
we
entertain
and
consequently
the
order
of
influences
we
attract
and
are
not
mere
willowy
creatures
of
circumstance
unless
indeed
we
choose
to
be
in
our
mental
lives
we
can
either
keep
hold
of
the
rudder
and
so
determine
exactly
what
course
we
take
what
points
we
touch
or
we
can
fail
to
do
this
and
failing
we
drift
and
are
blown
hither
and
thither
by
every
passing
breeze
and
so
on
the
contrary
welcome
should
be
the
thought
for
thus
we
may
draw
to
us
the
influence
and
the
aid
of
the
greatest
the
noblest
and
the
best
who
have
lived
on
the
earth
whatever
the
time
wherever
the
place
we
can
not
rationally
believe
other
than
that
those
who
have
labored
in
love
and
with
uplifting
power
here
are
still
laboring
in
the
same
way
and
in
all
probability
with
more
earnest
zeal
and
with
still
greater
power
and
elisha
prayed
and
said
lord
i
pray
thee
open
his
eyes
that
he
may
see
and
the
lord
opened
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
and
he
saw
and
behold
the
mountain
full
of
horses
and
chariots
of
round
about
elisha
while
riding
with
a
friend
a
few
days
ago
we
were
speaking
of
the
great
interest
people
are
everywhere
taking
in
the
more
vital
things
of
life
the
eagerness
with
which
they
are
reaching
out
for
a
knowledge
of
the
interior
forces
their
ever
increasing
desire
to
know
themselves
and
to
know
their
true
relations
with
the
infinite
and
in
speaking
of
the
great
spiritual
awakening
that
is
so
rapidly
coming
all
over
the
world
the
beginnings
of
which
we
are
so
clearly
seeing
during
the
closing
years
of
this
and
whose
ever
increasing
proportions
we
are
to
witness
during
the
early
years
of
the
coming
century
i
said
how
beautiful
if
emerson
the
illumined
one
so
far
in
advance
of
his
time
who
labored
so
faithfully
and
so
fearlessly
to
bring
about
these
very
conditions
how
beautiful
if
he
were
with
us
today
to
witness
it
all
how
he
would
rejoice
how
do
we
know
was
the
reply
that
he
is
not
witnessing
it
all
and
more
that
he
is
not
having
a
hand
in
it
all
a
hand
even
greater
perhaps
than
when
we
him
here
thank
you
my
friend
for
this
reminder
and
truly
are
they
not
all
ministering
spirits
sent
forth
to
minister
to
those
who
shall
be
heirs
of
salvation
as
science
is
so
abundantly
demonstrating
today
the
things
that
we
see
are
but
a
very
small
fraction
of
the
things
that
are
the
real
vital
forces
at
work
in
our
own
lives
and
in
the
world
about
us
are
not
seen
by
the
ordinary
physical
eye
yet
they
are
the
causes
of
which
all
things
we
see
are
merely
the
effects
thoughts
are
forces
like
builds
like
and
like
attracts
like
for
one
to
govern
his
thinking
then
is
to
determine
his
life
says
one
of
deep
insight
into
the
nature
of
things
the
law
of
correspondences
between
spiritual
and
material
things
is
wonderfully
exact
in
its
workings
people
ruled
by
the
mood
of
gloom
attract
to
them
gloomy
things
people
always
discouraged
and
despondent
do
not
succeed
in
anything
and
live
only
by
burdening
some
one
else
the
hopeful
confident
and
cheerful
attract
the
elements
of
success
a
man
front
or
back
yard
will
advertise
that
man
ruling
mood
in
the
way
it
is
kept
a
woman
at
home
shows
her
state
of
mind
in
her
dress
a
slattern
advertises
the
ruling
mood
of
hopelessness
carelessness
and
lack
of
system
rags
tatters
and
dirt
are
always
in
the
mind
before
being
on
the
body
the
thought
that
is
most
put
out
brings
its
corresponding
visible
element
to
crystallize
about
you
as
surely
and
literally
as
the
visible
bit
of
copper
in
solution
attracts
to
it
the
invisible
copper
in
that
solution
a
mind
always
hopeful
confident
courageous
and
determined
on
its
set
purpose
and
keeping
itself
to
that
purpose
attracts
to
itself
out
of
the
elements
things
and
powers
favorable
to
that
purpose
every
thought
of
yours
has
a
literal
value
to
you
in
every
possible
way
the
strength
of
your
body
the
strength
of
your
mind
your
success
in
business
and
the
pleasure
your
company
brings
others
depends
on
the
nature
of
your
thoughts
in
whatever
mood
you
set
your
mind
does
your
spirit
receive
of
unseen
substance
in
correspondence
with
that
mood
it
is
as
much
a
chemical
law
as
a
spiritual
law
chemistry
is
not
confined
to
the
elements
we
see
the
elements
we
do
not
see
with
the
physical
eye
outnumber
ten
thousand
times
those
we
do
see
the
christ
injunction
good
to
those
who
hate
you
is
based
on
a
scientific
fact
and
a
natural
law
so
to
do
good
is
to
bring
to
yourself
all
the
elements
in
nature
of
power
and
good
to
do
evil
is
to
bring
the
contrary
destructive
elements
when
our
eyes
are
opened
will
make
us
stop
all
evil
thought
those
who
live
by
hate
will
die
by
hate
that
is
who
live
by
the
sword
will
die
by
the
sword
every
evil
thought
is
as
a
sword
drawn
on
the
person
to
whom
it
is
directed
if
a
sword
is
drawn
in
return
so
much
the
worse
for
both
and
says
another
who
knows
full
well
whereof
he
speaks
the
law
of
attraction
works
universally
on
every
plane
of
and
we
attract
whatever
we
desire
or
expect
if
we
desire
one
thing
and
expect
another
we
become
like
houses
divided
against
themselves
which
are
quickly
brought
to
desolation
determine
resolutely
to
expect
only
what
you
desire
then
you
will
attract
only
what
you
wish
for
carry
any
kind
of
thought
you
please
about
with
you
and
so
long
as
you
retain
it
no
matter
how
you
roam
over
land
or
sea
you
will
unceasingly
attract
to
yourself
knowingly
or
inadvertently
exactly
and
only
what
corresponds
to
your
own
dominant
quality
of
thought
thoughts
are
our
private
property
and
we
can
regulate
them
to
suit
our
taste
entirely
by
steadily
recognizing
our
ability
so
to
do
we
have
just
spoken
of
the
drawing
power
of
mind
faith
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
operation
of
the
in
the
form
of
an
earnest
desire
coupled
with
expectation
as
to
its
fulfillment
and
in
the
degree
that
faith
the
earnest
desire
thus
sent
out
is
continually
held
to
and
watered
by
firm
expectation
in
just
that
degree
does
it
either
draw
to
itself
or
does
it
change
from
the
unseen
into
the
visible
from
the
spiritual
into
the
material
that
for
which
it
is
sent
let
the
element
of
doubt
or
fear
enter
in
and
what
would
otherwise
be
a
tremendous
force
will
be
so
neutralized
that
it
will
fail
of
its
realization
continually
held
to
and
continually
watered
by
firm
expectation
it
becomes
a
force
a
drawing
power
that
is
irresistible
and
absolute
and
the
results
will
be
absolute
in
direct
proportion
as
it
is
absolute
we
shall
find
as
we
are
so
rapidly
beginning
to
find
today
that
the
great
things
said
in
regard
to
faith
the
great
promises
made
in
connection
with
it
are
not
mere
vague
sentimentalities
but
are
all
great
scientific
facts
and
rest
upon
great
immutable
laws
even
in
our
very
laboratory
experiments
we
are
beginning
to
discover
the
laws
underlying
and
governing
these
forces
we
are
now
beginning
some
at
least
to
use
them
understandingly
and
not
blindly
as
has
so
often
and
so
long
been
the
case
much
is
said
today
in
regard
to
the
will
it
is
many
times
spoken
of
as
if
it
were
a
force
in
itself
but
will
is
a
force
a
power
only
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
particular
form
of
the
manifestation
of
the
thought
forces
for
it
is
by
what
we
call
the
will
that
thought
is
focused
and
given
a
particular
direction
and
in
the
degree
that
thought
is
thus
focused
and
given
direction
is
it
effective
in
the
work
it
is
sent
out
to
accomplish
in
a
sense
there
are
two
kinds
of
will
the
human
and
the
divine
the
human
will
is
the
will
of
what
for
convenience
sake
we
may
term
the
lower
self
it
is
the
will
that
finds
its
life
merely
in
the
realm
of
the
mental
and
the
physical
the
sense
will
it
is
the
will
of
the
one
who
is
not
yet
awake
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
life
that
far
transcends
the
life
of
merely
the
intellect
and
the
physical
senses
and
which
when
realized
and
lived
does
not
do
away
with
or
minify
these
but
which
on
the
contrary
brings
them
to
their
highest
perfection
and
to
their
powers
of
keenest
enjoyment
the
divine
will
is
the
will
of
the
higher
self
the
will
of
the
one
who
recognizes
his
oneness
with
the
divine
and
who
consequently
brings
his
will
to
work
in
harmony
in
conjunction
with
the
divine
will
the
lord
thy
god
the
midst
of
is
mighty
the
human
will
has
its
limitations
so
far
and
no
farther
says
the
law
the
divine
will
has
no
limitations
it
is
supreme
all
things
are
open
and
subject
to
you
says
the
law
and
so
in
the
degree
that
the
human
will
is
transmuted
into
the
divine
in
the
degree
that
it
comes
into
harmony
with
and
so
acts
in
conjunction
with
the
divine
does
it
become
supreme
then
it
is
that
thou
shalt
decree
a
thing
and
it
shall
be
established
unto
thee
the
great
secret
of
life
and
of
power
then
is
to
make
and
to
keep
one
conscious
connection
with
this
infinite
source
the
power
of
every
life
the
very
life
itself
is
determined
by
what
it
relates
itself
to
god
is
immanent
as
well
as
transcendent
he
is
creating
working
ruling
in
the
universe
today
in
your
life
and
in
mine
just
as
much
as
he
ever
has
been
we
are
too
apt
to
regard
him
after
the
manner
of
an
absentee
landlord
one
who
has
set
into
operation
the
forces
of
this
great
universe
and
then
taken
himself
away
in
the
degree
however
that
we
recognize
him
as
immanent
as
well
as
transcendent
are
we
able
to
partake
of
his
life
and
power
for
in
the
degree
that
we
recognize
him
as
the
infinite
spirit
of
life
and
power
that
is
today
at
this
very
moment
working
and
manifesting
in
and
through
all
and
then
in
the
degree
that
we
come
into
the
realization
of
our
oneness
with
this
life
do
we
become
partakers
of
and
so
do
we
actualize
in
ourselves
the
qualities
of
his
life
the
degree
that
we
open
ourselves
to
the
inflowing
tide
of
this
immanent
and
transcendent
life
do
we
make
ourselves
channels
through
which
the
infinite
intelligence
and
power
can
it
is
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
mind
that
we
are
enabled
to
connect
the
real
soul
life
with
the
physical
life
and
so
enable
the
soul
life
to
manifest
and
work
through
the
physical
the
thought
life
needs
to
be
illumined
from
within
this
illumination
can
come
in
just
the
degree
that
through
the
agency
of
the
mind
we
recognize
our
oneness
with
the
divine
of
which
each
soul
is
an
individual
form
of
expression
this
gives
us
the
inner
guiding
which
we
call
intuition
intuition
is
to
the
spiritual
nature
and
understanding
practically
what
sense
perception
is
to
the
sensuous
nature
and
understanding
it
is
an
inner
spiritual
sense
through
which
man
is
opened
to
the
direct
revelation
and
knowledge
of
god
the
secrets
of
nature
and
life
and
through
which
he
is
brought
into
conscious
unity
and
fellowship
with
god
and
made
to
realize
his
own
deific
nature
and
supremacy
of
being
as
the
son
of
god
spiritual
supremacy
and
illumination
thus
realized
through
the
development
and
perfection
of
intuition
under
divine
inspiration
gives
the
perfect
inner
vision
and
direct
insight
into
the
character
properties
and
purpose
of
all
things
to
which
the
attention
and
interest
are
directed
it
is
we
repeat
a
spiritual
sense
opening
inwardly
as
the
physical
senses
open
outwardly
and
because
it
has
the
capacity
to
perceive
grasp
and
know
the
truth
at
first
hand
independent
of
all
external
sources
of
information
we
call
it
intuition
all
inspired
teaching
and
spiritual
revelations
are
based
upon
the
recognition
of
this
spiritual
faculty
of
the
soul
and
its
power
to
receive
and
appropriate
them
conscious
unity
of
man
in
spirit
and
purpose
with
the
father
born
out
of
his
supreme
desire
and
trust
opens
his
soul
through
this
inner
sense
to
immediate
inspiration
and
enlightenment
from
the
divine
omniscience
and
the
energy
of
the
divine
omnipotence
under
which
he
becomes
a
seer
and
a
master
on
this
higher
plane
of
realized
spiritual
life
in
the
flesh
the
mind
holds
the
impersonal
attitude
and
acts
with
unfettered
freedom
and
unbiased
vision
grasping
truth
at
first
hand
independent
of
all
external
sources
of
information
approaching
all
beings
and
things
from
the
divine
side
they
are
seen
in
the
light
of
the
divine
omniscience
god
purpose
in
them
and
so
the
truth
concerning
them
as
it
rests
in
the
mind
of
god
are
thus
revealed
by
direct
illumination
from
the
divine
mind
to
which
the
soul
is
opened
inwardly
through
this
spiritual
sense
we
call
intuition
some
call
it
the
voice
of
the
soul
some
call
it
the
voice
of
god
some
call
it
the
sixth
sense
it
is
our
inner
spiritual
sense
in
the
degree
that
we
come
into
the
recognition
of
our
own
selves
into
the
realization
of
the
oneness
of
our
life
with
the
infinite
life
and
in
the
degree
that
we
open
ourselves
to
this
divine
inflow
does
this
voice
of
intuition
this
voice
of
the
soul
this
voice
of
god
speak
clearly
and
in
the
degree
that
we
recognize
listen
to
and
obey
it
does
it
speak
ever
more
clearly
until
there
comes
the
time
when
it
is
unerring
in
its
guidance
fullness
of
life
bodily
health
and
vigor
god
is
the
spirit
of
infinite
life
if
we
are
partakers
of
this
life
and
have
the
power
of
opening
ourselves
fully
to
its
divine
inflow
it
means
more
so
far
as
even
the
physical
life
is
concerned
than
we
may
at
first
think
for
very
clearly
the
life
of
this
infinite
spirit
from
its
very
nature
can
admit
of
no
disease
and
if
this
is
true
no
disease
can
exist
in
the
body
where
it
freely
enters
through
which
it
freely
flows
let
us
recognize
at
the
outset
that
so
far
as
the
physical
life
is
concerned
life
is
from
within
there
is
an
immutable
law
which
says
as
within
so
without
cause
effect
in
other
words
the
thought
forces
the
various
mental
states
and
the
emotions
all
have
in
time
their
effects
upon
the
physical
body
some
one
says
i
hear
a
great
deal
said
today
in
regard
to
the
effects
of
the
mind
upon
the
body
but
i
do
know
as
i
place
very
much
confidence
in
this
do
you
some
one
brings
you
sudden
news
you
grow
pale
you
tremble
or
perhaps
you
fall
into
a
faint
it
is
however
through
the
channel
of
your
mind
that
the
news
is
imparted
to
you
a
friend
says
something
to
you
perhaps
at
the
table
something
that
seems
very
unkind
you
are
hurt
by
it
as
we
say
you
have
been
enjoying
your
dinner
but
from
this
moment
your
appetite
is
gone
but
what
was
said
entered
into
and
affected
you
through
the
channel
of
your
mind
look
yonder
goes
a
young
man
dragging
his
feet
stumbling
over
the
slightest
obstruction
in
the
path
why
is
it
simply
that
he
is
an
idiot
in
other
words
falling
state
of
mind
is
productive
of
a
falling
condition
of
the
to
be
sure
minded
is
to
be
sure
footed
to
be
uncertain
in
mind
is
to
be
uncertain
in
step
again
a
sudden
emergency
arises
you
stand
trembling
and
weak
with
fear
why
are
you
powerless
to
move
why
do
you
tremble
and
yet
you
believe
that
the
mind
has
but
little
influence
upon
the
body
you
are
for
a
moment
dominated
by
a
fit
of
anger
for
a
few
hours
afterwards
you
complain
of
a
violent
headache
and
still
you
do
not
seem
to
realize
that
the
thoughts
and
emotions
have
an
effect
upon
the
body
a
day
or
two
ago
while
conversing
with
a
friend
we
were
speaking
of
worry
my
father
is
greatly
given
to
worry
he
said
your
father
is
not
a
healthy
man
i
said
he
is
not
strong
vigorous
robust
and
active
i
then
went
on
to
describe
to
him
more
fully
his
condition
and
the
troubles
which
afflicted
him
he
looked
at
me
in
surprise
and
said
why
you
do
not
know
my
father
no
i
replied
how
then
can
you
describe
so
accurately
the
disease
with
which
he
is
afflicted
you
have
just
told
me
that
your
father
is
greatly
given
to
worry
when
you
told
me
this
you
indicated
to
me
cause
in
describing
your
father
condition
i
simply
connected
with
the
cause
its
own
peculiar
effects
fear
and
worry
have
the
effect
of
closing
up
the
channels
of
the
body
so
that
the
life
forces
flow
in
a
slow
and
sluggish
manner
hope
and
tranquillity
open
the
channels
of
the
body
so
that
the
life
forces
go
bounding
through
it
in
such
a
way
that
disease
can
rarely
get
a
foothold
not
long
ago
a
lady
was
telling
a
friend
of
a
serious
physical
trouble
my
friend
happened
to
know
that
between
this
lady
and
her
sister
the
most
kindly
relations
did
not
exist
he
listened
attentively
to
her
delineation
of
her
troubles
and
then
looking
her
squarely
in
the
face
in
a
firm
but
kindly
tone
said
forgive
your
sister
the
woman
looked
at
him
in
surprise
and
said
i
ca
forgive
my
sister
very
well
then
he
replied
keep
the
stiffness
of
your
joints
and
your
kindred
rheumatic
troubles
a
few
weeks
later
he
saw
her
again
with
a
light
step
she
came
toward
him
and
said
i
took
your
advice
i
saw
my
sister
and
forgave
her
we
have
become
good
friends
again
and
i
do
know
how
it
is
but
somehow
or
other
from
the
very
day
as
i
remember
that
we
became
reconciled
my
troubles
seemed
to
grow
less
and
today
there
is
not
a
trace
of
the
old
difficulties
left
and
really
my
sister
and
i
have
become
such
good
friends
that
now
we
can
scarcely
get
along
without
one
another
again
we
have
effect
following
cause
we
have
several
cases
of
the
following
nature
a
mother
has
been
dominated
for
a
few
moments
by
an
intense
passion
of
anger
and
the
child
at
her
breast
has
died
within
an
hour
time
so
poisoned
became
the
mother
milk
by
virtue
of
the
poisonous
secretions
of
the
system
while
under
the
domination
of
this
fit
of
anger
in
other
cases
it
has
caused
severe
illness
and
convulsions
the
following
experiment
has
been
tried
a
number
of
times
by
a
scientist
several
men
have
been
put
into
a
heated
room
each
man
has
been
dominated
for
a
moment
by
a
particular
passion
of
some
kind
one
by
an
intense
passion
of
anger
and
others
by
different
other
passions
the
experimenter
has
taken
a
drop
of
perspiration
from
the
body
of
each
of
these
men
and
by
means
of
a
careful
chemical
analysis
he
has
been
able
to
determine
the
particular
passion
by
which
each
has
been
dominated
practically
the
same
results
revealed
themselves
in
the
chemical
analysis
of
the
saliva
of
each
of
the
men
says
a
noted
american
author
an
able
graduate
of
one
of
our
greatest
medical
schools
and
one
who
has
studied
deeply
into
the
forces
that
build
the
body
and
the
forces
that
tear
it
down
the
mind
is
the
natural
protector
of
the
body
every
thought
tends
to
reproduce
itself
and
ghastly
mental
pictures
of
disease
sensuality
and
vice
of
all
sorts
produce
scrofula
and
leprosy
in
the
soul
which
reproduces
them
in
the
body
anger
changes
the
chemical
properties
of
the
saliva
to
a
poison
dangerous
to
life
it
is
well
known
that
sudden
and
violent
emotions
have
not
only
weakened
the
heart
in
a
few
hours
but
have
caused
death
and
insanity
it
has
been
discovered
by
scientists
that
there
is
a
chemical
difference
between
that
sudden
cold
exudation
of
a
person
under
a
deep
sense
of
guilt
and
the
ordinary
perspiration
and
the
state
of
the
mind
can
sometimes
be
determined
by
chemical
analysis
of
the
perspiration
of
a
criminal
which
when
brought
into
contact
with
selenic
acid
produces
a
distinctive
pink
color
it
is
well
known
that
fear
has
killed
thousands
of
victims
while
on
the
other
hand
is
a
great
anger
in
the
mother
may
poison
a
nursing
child
rarey
the
celebrated
said
that
an
angry
word
would
sometimes
raise
the
pulse
of
a
horse
ten
beats
in
a
minute
if
this
is
true
of
a
beast
what
can
we
say
of
its
power
upon
human
beings
especially
upon
a
child
strong
mental
emotion
often
causes
vomiting
extreme
anger
or
fright
may
produce
jaundice
a
violent
paroxysm
of
rage
has
caused
apoplexy
and
death
indeed
in
more
than
one
instance
a
single
night
of
mental
agony
has
wrecked
a
life
grief
jealousy
constant
care
and
corroding
anxiety
sometimes
tend
to
develop
insanity
sick
thoughts
and
discordant
moods
are
the
natural
atmosphere
of
disease
and
crime
is
engendered
and
thrives
in
the
miasma
of
the
mind
from
all
this
we
get
the
great
fact
we
are
scientifically
demonstrating
today
that
the
various
mental
states
emotions
and
passions
have
their
various
peculiar
effects
upon
the
body
and
each
induces
in
turn
if
indulged
in
to
any
great
extent
its
own
peculiar
forms
of
disease
and
these
in
time
become
chronic
just
a
word
or
two
in
regard
to
their
mode
of
operation
if
a
person
is
dominated
for
a
moment
by
say
a
passion
of
anger
there
is
set
up
in
the
physical
organism
what
we
might
justly
term
a
bodily
which
has
the
effect
of
souring
or
rather
of
corroding
the
normal
healthy
and
secretions
of
the
body
so
that
instead
of
performing
their
natural
functions
they
become
poisonous
and
destructive
and
if
this
goes
on
to
any
great
extent
by
virtue
of
their
cumulative
influences
they
give
rise
to
a
particular
form
of
disease
which
in
turn
becomes
chronic
so
the
emotion
opposite
to
this
that
of
kindliness
love
benevolence
tends
to
stimulate
a
healthy
purifying
and
flow
of
all
the
bodily
secretions
all
the
channels
of
the
body
seem
free
and
open
the
life
forces
go
bounding
through
them
and
these
very
forces
set
into
a
bounding
activity
will
in
time
counteract
the
poisonous
and
effects
of
their
opposites
a
physician
goes
to
see
a
patient
he
gives
no
medicine
this
morning
yet
the
very
fact
of
his
going
makes
the
patient
better
he
has
carried
with
him
the
spirit
of
health
he
has
carried
brightness
of
tone
and
disposition
he
has
carried
hope
into
the
sick
chamber
he
has
left
it
there
in
fact
the
very
hope
and
good
cheer
he
has
carried
with
him
has
taken
hold
of
and
has
had
a
subtle
but
powerful
influence
upon
the
mind
of
the
patient
and
this
mental
condition
imparted
by
the
physician
has
in
turn
its
effects
upon
the
patient
body
and
so
through
the
instrumentality
of
this
mental
suggestion
the
healing
goes
on
know
then
whatever
cheerful
and
serene
supports
the
mind
supports
the
body
too
hence
the
most
vital
movement
mortals
feel
is
the
balm
and
of
the
soul
we
sometimes
hear
a
person
in
weak
health
say
to
another
i
always
feel
better
when
you
come
there
is
a
deep
scientific
reason
underlying
the
statement
the
tongue
of
the
wise
is
health
the
power
of
suggestion
so
far
as
the
human
mind
is
concerned
is
a
most
wonderful
and
interesting
field
of
study
most
wonderful
and
powerful
forces
can
be
set
into
operation
through
this
agency
one
of
the
world
most
noted
scientists
recognized
everywhere
as
one
of
the
most
eminent
anatomists
living
tells
us
that
he
has
proven
from
laboratory
experiments
that
the
entire
human
structure
can
be
completely
changed
made
over
within
a
period
of
less
than
one
year
and
that
some
portions
can
be
entirely
remade
within
a
period
of
a
very
few
weeks
do
you
mean
to
say
i
hear
it
asked
that
the
body
can
be
changed
from
a
diseased
to
a
healthy
condition
through
the
operation
of
the
interior
forces
most
certainly
and
more
this
is
the
natural
method
of
cure
the
method
that
has
as
its
work
the
application
of
drugs
medicines
and
external
agencies
is
the
artificial
method
the
only
thing
that
any
drug
or
any
medicine
can
do
is
to
remove
obstructions
that
the
life
forces
may
have
simply
a
better
chance
to
do
their
work
real
healing
process
must
be
performed
by
the
operation
of
the
life
forces
a
surgeon
and
physician
of
fame
recently
made
to
his
medical
associates
the
following
declaration
for
generations
past
the
most
important
influence
that
plays
upon
nutrition
the
itself
has
remained
an
unconsidered
element
in
the
medical
profession
and
the
almost
exclusive
drift
of
its
studies
and
remedial
paraphernalia
has
been
confined
to
the
action
of
matter
over
mind
this
has
seriously
interfered
with
the
evolutionary
tendencies
of
the
doctors
themselves
and
consequently
the
psychic
factor
in
professional
life
is
still
in
a
rudimentary
or
comparatively
undeveloped
state
but
the
light
of
the
nineteenth
century
has
dawned
and
so
the
march
of
mankind
in
general
is
taken
in
the
direction
of
the
hidden
forces
of
nature
doctors
are
now
compelled
to
join
the
ranks
of
students
in
psychology
and
follow
their
patrons
into
the
broader
field
of
mental
therapeutics
there
is
no
time
for
lingering
no
time
for
skepticism
or
doubt
or
hesitation
who
lingers
is
lost
for
the
entire
race
is
enlisted
in
the
i
am
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
connection
with
the
matter
we
are
now
considering
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
foolishness
during
the
past
few
years
many
absurd
and
foolish
things
have
been
claimed
and
done
but
this
says
nothing
against
and
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
great
underlying
laws
themselves
the
same
has
been
true
of
the
early
days
of
practically
every
system
of
ethics
or
philosophy
or
religion
the
world
has
ever
known
but
as
time
has
passed
these
foolish
absurd
things
have
fallen
away
and
the
great
eternal
principles
have
stood
out
ever
more
and
more
clearly
defined
i
know
of
many
cases
where
an
entire
and
permanent
cure
has
been
effected
in
some
within
a
remarkably
short
period
of
time
through
the
operation
of
these
forces
some
of
them
are
cases
that
had
been
entirely
given
up
by
the
regular
practice
we
have
numerous
accounts
of
such
cases
in
all
times
and
in
connection
with
all
religions
and
why
should
not
the
power
of
effecting
such
cures
exist
among
us
today
the
does
and
it
will
be
actualized
in
just
the
degree
that
we
recognize
the
same
great
laws
that
were
recognized
in
times
past
one
person
may
do
a
very
great
deal
in
connection
with
the
healing
of
another
but
this
almost
invariably
implies
on
the
part
of
the
one
who
is
thus
treated
in
the
cures
that
christ
performed
he
most
always
needed
the
of
the
one
who
appealed
to
him
his
question
almost
invariably
was
dost
thou
believe
he
thus
stimulated
into
activity
the
forces
within
the
one
cured
if
one
is
in
a
very
weak
condition
or
if
his
nervous
system
is
exhausted
or
if
his
mind
through
the
influence
of
the
disease
is
not
so
strong
in
its
workings
it
may
be
well
for
him
for
a
time
to
seek
the
aid
and
of
another
but
it
would
be
far
better
for
such
a
one
could
he
bring
himself
to
a
vital
realization
of
the
omnipotence
of
his
own
interior
powers
one
may
cure
another
but
to
be
one
must
do
it
himself
in
this
way
another
may
be
most
valuable
as
a
teacher
by
bringing
one
to
a
clear
realization
of
the
power
of
the
forces
within
but
in
every
case
in
order
to
have
a
permanent
cure
the
work
of
the
self
is
necessary
christ
words
were
almost
invariably
go
and
sin
no
more
or
thy
sins
are
forgiven
thee
thus
pointing
out
the
one
eternal
and
fact
that
all
disease
and
its
consequent
suffering
is
the
direct
or
the
indirect
result
of
the
violation
of
law
either
consciously
or
unconsciously
either
intentionally
or
unintentionally
suffering
is
designed
to
continue
only
so
long
as
sin
continues
sin
not
necessarily
in
the
theological
but
always
in
the
philosophical
sense
though
many
times
in
the
sense
of
both
the
moment
the
violation
ceases
the
moment
one
comes
into
perfect
harmony
with
the
law
the
cause
of
the
suffering
ceases
and
though
there
may
be
residing
within
the
cumulative
effects
of
past
violation
the
cause
is
removed
and
consequently
there
can
be
no
more
effects
in
the
form
of
additions
and
even
the
diseased
condition
that
has
been
induced
from
past
violation
will
begin
to
disappear
as
soon
as
the
right
forces
are
set
into
activity
there
is
nothing
that
will
more
quickly
and
more
completely
bring
one
into
harmony
with
the
laws
under
which
he
lives
than
this
vital
realization
of
his
oneness
with
the
infinite
spirit
which
is
the
life
of
all
life
in
this
there
can
be
no
disease
and
nothing
will
more
readily
remove
from
the
organism
the
obstructions
that
have
accumulated
there
or
in
other
words
the
disease
that
resides
there
than
this
full
realization
and
the
complete
opening
of
one
self
to
this
divine
inflow
i
shall
put
my
spirit
in
you
and
ye
shall
live
the
moment
a
person
realizes
his
oneness
with
the
infinite
spirit
he
recognizes
himself
as
a
spiritual
being
and
no
longer
as
a
mere
physical
material
being
he
then
no
longer
makes
the
mistake
of
regarding
himself
as
body
subject
to
ills
and
diseases
but
he
realizes
the
fact
that
he
is
spirit
spirit
now
as
much
as
he
ever
will
or
can
be
and
that
he
is
the
builder
and
so
the
master
of
the
body
the
house
in
which
he
lives
and
the
moment
he
thus
recognizes
his
power
as
master
he
ceases
in
any
way
to
allow
it
the
mastery
over
him
he
no
longer
fears
the
elements
or
any
of
the
forces
that
he
now
in
his
ignorance
allows
to
take
hold
of
and
affect
the
body
the
moment
he
realizes
his
own
supremacy
instead
of
fearing
them
as
he
did
when
he
was
out
of
harmony
with
them
he
learns
to
love
them
he
thus
comes
into
harmony
with
them
or
rather
he
so
orders
them
that
they
come
into
harmony
with
him
he
who
formerly
was
the
slave
has
now
become
the
master
the
moment
we
come
to
love
a
thing
it
no
longer
carries
harm
for
us
there
are
almost
countless
numbers
today
weak
and
suffering
in
body
who
would
become
strong
and
healthy
if
they
would
only
give
god
an
opportunity
to
do
his
work
to
such
i
would
say
shut
out
the
divine
do
anything
else
rather
than
this
open
yourselves
to
it
invite
it
in
the
degree
that
you
open
yourselves
to
it
its
inflowing
tide
will
course
through
your
bodies
a
force
so
vital
that
the
old
obstructions
that
are
dominating
them
today
will
be
driven
out
before
it
my
words
are
life
to
them
that
find
them
and
health
to
all
their
flesh
there
is
a
trough
through
which
a
stream
of
muddy
water
has
been
flowing
for
many
days
the
dirt
has
gradually
collected
on
its
sides
and
bottom
and
it
continues
to
collect
as
long
as
the
muddy
water
flows
through
it
change
this
open
the
trough
to
a
stream
of
clear
crystal
water
and
in
a
very
little
while
even
the
very
dirt
that
has
collected
on
its
sides
and
bottom
will
be
carried
away
the
trough
will
be
entirely
cleansed
it
will
present
an
aspect
of
beauty
and
no
longer
an
aspect
of
ugliness
and
more
the
water
that
now
courses
through
it
will
be
of
value
it
will
be
an
agent
of
refreshment
of
health
and
of
strength
to
those
who
use
it
yes
in
just
the
degree
that
you
realize
your
oneness
with
this
infinite
spirit
of
life
and
thus
actualize
your
latent
possibilities
and
powers
you
will
exchange
for
ease
inharmony
for
harmony
suffering
and
pain
for
abounding
health
and
strength
and
in
the
degree
that
you
realize
this
wholeness
this
abounding
health
and
strength
in
yourself
will
you
carry
it
to
all
with
whom
you
come
in
contact
for
must
remember
that
health
is
contagious
as
well
as
i
hear
it
asked
what
can
be
said
in
a
concrete
way
in
regard
to
the
practical
application
of
these
truths
so
that
one
can
hold
himself
in
the
enjoyment
of
perfect
bodily
health
and
more
that
one
may
heal
himself
of
any
existing
disease
in
reply
let
it
be
said
that
the
chief
thing
that
can
be
done
is
to
point
out
the
great
underlying
principle
and
that
each
individual
must
make
his
own
application
one
person
can
not
well
make
this
for
another
first
let
it
be
said
that
the
very
fact
of
one
holding
the
thought
of
perfect
health
sets
into
operation
vital
forces
which
will
in
time
be
more
or
less
productive
of
the
effect
perfect
health
then
speaking
more
directly
in
regard
to
the
great
principle
itself
from
its
very
nature
it
is
clear
that
more
can
be
accomplished
through
the
process
of
realization
than
through
the
process
of
affirmation
though
for
some
affirmation
may
be
a
help
an
aid
to
realization
in
the
degree
however
that
you
come
into
a
vital
realization
of
your
oneness
with
the
infinite
spirit
of
life
whence
all
life
in
individual
form
has
come
and
is
continually
coming
and
in
the
degree
that
through
this
realization
you
open
yourself
to
its
divine
inflow
do
you
set
into
operation
forces
that
will
sooner
or
later
bring
even
the
physical
body
into
a
state
of
abounding
health
and
strength
for
to
realize
that
this
infinite
spirit
of
life
can
from
its
very
nature
admit
of
no
disease
and
to
realize
that
this
then
is
the
life
in
you
by
realizing
your
oneness
with
it
you
can
so
open
yourself
to
its
more
abundant
entrance
that
the
diseased
bodily
conditions
effects
will
respond
to
the
influences
of
its
power
this
either
quickly
or
more
tardily
depending
entirely
upon
yourself
there
have
been
those
who
have
been
able
to
open
themselves
so
fully
to
this
realization
that
the
healing
has
been
instantaneous
and
permanent
the
degree
of
intensity
always
eliminates
in
like
degree
the
element
of
time
must
however
be
a
calm
quiet
and
expectant
intensity
rather
than
an
intensity
that
is
fearing
disturbed
and
then
there
are
others
who
have
come
to
this
realization
by
degrees
many
will
receive
great
help
and
many
will
be
entirely
healed
by
a
practice
somewhat
after
the
following
nature
with
a
mind
at
peace
and
with
a
heart
going
out
in
love
to
all
go
into
the
quiet
of
your
own
interior
self
holding
the
thought
i
am
one
with
the
infinite
spirit
of
life
the
life
of
my
life
i
then
as
spirit
i
a
spiritual
being
can
in
my
own
real
nature
admit
of
no
disease
i
now
open
my
body
in
which
disease
has
gotten
a
foothold
i
open
it
fully
to
the
inflowing
tide
of
this
infinite
life
and
it
now
even
now
is
pouring
in
and
coursing
through
my
body
and
the
healing
process
is
going
on
realize
this
so
fully
that
you
begin
to
feel
a
quickening
and
a
warming
glow
imparted
by
the
life
forces
to
the
body
believe
the
healing
process
is
going
on
believe
it
and
hold
continually
to
it
many
people
greatly
desire
a
certain
thing
but
expect
something
else
they
have
greater
faith
in
the
power
of
evil
than
in
the
power
of
good
and
hence
remain
ill
if
one
will
give
himself
to
this
meditation
realization
treatment
or
whatever
term
it
may
seem
best
to
use
at
stated
times
as
often
as
he
may
choose
and
then
hold
himself
in
the
same
attitude
of
thus
allowing
the
force
to
work
continually
he
will
be
surprised
how
rapidly
the
body
will
be
exchanging
conditions
of
disease
and
inharmony
for
health
and
harmony
there
is
no
particular
reason
however
for
this
surprise
for
in
this
way
he
is
simply
allowing
the
omnipotent
power
to
do
the
work
which
will
have
to
do
it
ultimately
in
any
case
if
there
is
a
local
difficulty
and
one
wants
to
open
this
particular
portion
in
addition
to
the
entire
body
to
this
inflowing
life
he
can
hold
this
particular
portion
in
thought
for
to
fix
the
thought
in
this
way
upon
any
particular
portion
of
the
body
stimulates
or
increases
the
flow
of
the
life
forces
in
that
portion
it
must
always
be
borne
in
mind
however
that
whatever
healing
may
be
thus
accomplished
effects
will
not
permanently
cease
until
causes
have
been
removed
in
other
words
long
as
there
is
the
violation
of
law
so
long
disease
and
suffering
will
this
realization
that
we
are
considering
will
have
an
influence
not
only
where
there
is
a
diseased
condition
of
the
body
but
even
where
there
is
not
this
condition
it
will
give
an
increased
bodily
life
vigor
and
power
we
have
had
many
cases
in
all
times
and
in
all
countries
of
healing
through
the
operation
of
the
interior
forces
entirely
independent
of
external
agencies
various
have
been
the
methods
or
rather
various
have
been
the
names
applied
to
them
but
the
great
law
underlying
all
is
one
and
the
same
and
the
same
today
when
the
master
sent
his
followers
forth
his
injunction
to
them
was
to
heal
the
sick
and
the
afflicted
as
well
as
to
teach
the
people
the
early
church
fathers
had
the
power
of
healing
in
short
it
was
a
part
of
their
work
and
why
should
we
not
have
the
power
today
the
same
as
they
had
it
then
are
the
laws
at
all
different
identically
the
same
why
then
simply
because
with
a
few
rare
exceptions
here
and
there
we
are
unable
to
get
beyond
the
mere
letter
of
the
law
into
its
real
vital
spirit
and
power
it
is
the
letter
that
killeth
it
is
the
spirit
that
giveth
life
and
power
every
soul
who
becomes
so
individualized
that
he
breaks
through
the
mere
letter
and
enters
into
the
real
vital
spirit
have
the
as
have
all
who
have
gone
before
and
when
he
does
he
will
also
be
the
means
of
imparting
it
to
others
for
he
will
be
one
who
will
move
and
who
will
speak
with
authority
we
are
rapidly
finding
today
and
we
shall
find
even
more
and
more
as
time
passes
that
practically
all
disease
with
its
consequent
suffering
has
its
origin
in
perverted
mental
and
emotional
states
and
conditions
mental
attitude
we
take
toward
anything
determines
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
its
effects
upon
if
we
fear
it
or
if
we
antagonize
it
the
chances
are
that
it
will
have
detrimental
or
even
disastrous
effects
upon
us
if
we
come
into
harmony
with
it
by
quietly
recognizing
and
inwardly
asserting
our
superiority
over
it
in
the
degree
that
we
are
able
successfully
to
do
this
in
that
degree
will
it
carry
with
it
no
injury
for
us
no
disease
can
enter
into
or
take
hold
of
our
bodies
unless
it
find
therein
something
corresponding
to
itself
which
makes
it
possible
and
in
the
same
way
no
evil
or
undesirable
condition
of
any
kind
can
come
into
our
lives
unless
there
is
already
in
them
that
which
invites
it
and
so
makes
it
possible
for
it
to
come
the
sooner
we
begin
to
look
within
ourselves
for
the
cause
of
whatever
comes
to
us
the
better
it
will
be
for
so
much
the
sooner
will
we
begin
to
make
conditions
within
ourselves
such
that
only
may
enter
we
who
from
our
very
natures
should
be
masters
of
all
conditions
by
virtue
of
our
ignorance
are
mastered
by
almost
numberless
conditions
of
every
description
do
i
fear
a
draft
there
is
nothing
in
the
draft
a
little
purifying
current
of
god
pure
air
to
cause
me
trouble
to
bring
on
a
cold
perhaps
an
illness
the
draft
can
affect
me
only
in
the
degree
that
make
it
possible
only
in
the
degree
that
i
allow
it
to
affect
me
we
must
distinguish
between
causes
and
mere
occasions
the
draft
is
not
cause
nor
does
it
carry
cause
with
it
two
persons
are
sitting
in
the
same
draft
the
one
is
injuriously
affected
by
it
the
other
experiences
not
even
an
inconvenience
but
he
rather
enjoys
it
the
one
is
a
creature
of
circumstances
he
fears
the
draft
cringes
before
it
continually
thinks
of
the
harm
it
is
doing
him
in
other
words
he
opens
every
avenue
for
it
to
enter
and
take
hold
of
him
and
so
it
harmless
and
beneficent
in
itself
brings
to
him
exactly
what
he
has
empowered
it
to
bring
the
other
recognizes
himself
as
the
master
over
and
not
the
creature
of
circumstances
he
is
not
concerned
about
the
draft
he
puts
himself
into
harmony
with
it
makes
himself
positive
to
it
and
instead
of
experiencing
any
discomfort
he
enjoys
it
and
in
addition
to
its
doing
him
a
service
by
bringing
the
pure
fresh
air
from
without
to
him
it
does
him
the
additional
service
of
hardening
him
even
more
to
any
future
conditions
of
a
like
nature
but
if
the
draft
was
cause
it
would
bring
the
same
results
to
both
the
fact
that
it
does
not
shows
that
it
is
not
a
cause
but
a
condition
and
it
brings
to
each
effects
which
correspond
to
the
conditions
it
finds
within
each
poor
draft
how
many
thousands
nay
millions
of
times
it
is
made
the
scapegoat
by
those
who
are
too
ignorant
or
too
unfair
to
look
their
own
weaknesses
square
in
the
face
and
who
instead
of
becoming
imperial
masters
remain
cringing
slaves
think
of
it
what
it
means
a
man
created
in
the
image
of
the
eternal
god
sharer
of
his
life
and
power
born
to
have
dominion
fearing
shaking
cringing
before
a
little
draft
of
pure
air
but
scapegoats
are
convenient
things
even
if
the
only
thing
they
do
for
us
is
to
aid
us
in
our
constant
efforts
at
the
best
way
to
disarm
a
draft
of
the
bad
effects
it
has
been
accustomed
to
bring
one
is
first
to
bring
about
a
pure
and
healthy
set
of
conditions
within
then
to
change
one
mental
attitude
toward
it
recognize
the
fact
that
of
itself
it
has
no
power
it
has
only
the
power
you
invest
it
with
thus
you
will
put
yourself
into
harmony
with
it
and
will
no
longer
sit
in
fear
of
it
then
sit
in
a
draft
a
few
times
and
get
hardened
to
it
as
every
one
by
going
at
it
judiciously
can
readily
do
but
suppose
one
is
in
delicate
health
or
especially
subject
to
drafts
then
be
simply
a
little
judicious
at
first
seek
the
strongest
that
can
be
found
especially
if
you
do
not
as
yet
in
your
own
mind
feel
equal
to
it
for
if
you
do
not
it
signifies
that
you
still
fear
it
that
supreme
regulator
of
all
life
common
must
be
used
here
the
same
as
elsewhere
if
we
are
born
to
have
dominion
and
that
we
are
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
some
have
attained
to
it
and
what
one
done
soon
or
late
all
do
then
it
is
not
necessary
that
we
live
under
the
domination
of
any
physical
agent
in
the
degree
that
we
recognize
our
own
interior
powers
then
are
we
rulers
and
able
to
dictate
in
the
degree
that
we
fail
to
recognize
them
we
are
slaves
and
are
dictated
to
we
build
whatever
we
find
within
us
we
attract
whatever
comes
to
us
and
all
in
accordance
with
spiritual
law
for
all
natural
law
is
spiritual
law
the
whole
of
human
life
is
cause
and
effect
there
is
no
such
thing
in
it
as
chance
nor
is
there
even
in
all
the
wide
universe
are
we
not
satisfied
with
whatever
comes
into
our
lives
the
thing
to
do
then
is
not
to
spend
time
in
railing
against
the
imaginary
something
we
create
and
call
fate
but
to
look
to
the
within
and
change
the
causes
at
work
there
in
order
that
things
of
a
different
nature
may
come
for
there
will
come
exactly
what
we
cause
to
come
this
is
true
not
only
of
the
physical
body
but
of
all
phases
and
conditions
of
life
we
invite
whatever
comes
and
did
we
not
invite
it
either
consciously
or
unconsciously
it
could
not
and
it
would
not
come
this
may
undoubtedly
be
hard
for
some
to
believe
or
even
to
see
at
first
but
in
the
degree
that
one
candidly
and
looks
at
it
and
then
studies
into
the
silent
but
subtle
and
so
to
speak
omnipotent
workings
of
the
thought
forces
and
as
he
traces
their
effects
within
him
and
about
him
it
becomes
clearly
evident
and
easy
to
understand
and
then
whatever
does
come
to
one
depends
for
its
effects
entirely
upon
his
mental
attitude
toward
it
does
this
or
that
occurrence
or
condition
cause
you
annoyance
very
well
it
causes
you
annoyance
and
so
disturbs
your
peace
merely
because
you
allow
it
to
you
are
born
to
have
absolute
control
over
your
own
dominion
but
if
you
voluntarily
hand
over
this
power
even
if
for
a
little
while
to
some
one
or
to
some
thing
else
then
you
of
course
become
the
creature
the
one
controlled
to
live
undisturbed
by
passing
occurrences
you
must
first
find
your
own
centre
you
must
then
be
firm
in
your
own
centre
and
so
rule
the
world
from
within
he
who
does
not
himself
condition
circumstances
allows
the
process
to
be
reversed
and
becomes
a
conditioned
circumstance
find
your
centre
and
live
in
it
surrender
it
to
no
person
to
no
thing
in
the
degree
that
you
do
this
will
you
find
yourself
growing
stronger
and
stronger
in
it
and
how
can
one
find
his
centre
by
realizing
his
oneness
with
the
infinite
power
and
by
living
continually
in
this
realization
but
if
you
do
not
rule
from
your
own
centre
if
you
invest
this
or
that
with
the
power
of
bringing
you
annoyance
or
evil
or
harm
then
take
what
it
brings
but
cease
your
railings
against
the
eternal
goodness
and
beneficence
of
all
things
i
swear
the
earth
shall
surely
be
complete
to
him
or
her
who
shall
be
complete
the
earth
remains
jagged
and
broken
only
to
him
who
remains
jagged
and
broken
if
the
windows
of
your
soul
are
dirty
and
streaked
covered
with
matter
foreign
to
them
then
the
world
as
you
look
out
of
them
will
be
to
you
dirty
and
streaked
and
out
of
order
cease
your
complainings
however
keep
your
pessimism
your
poor
unfortunate
me
to
yourself
lest
you
betray
the
fact
that
your
windows
are
badly
in
need
of
something
but
know
that
your
friend
who
keeps
his
windows
clean
that
the
eternal
sun
may
illumine
all
within
and
make
visible
all
without
know
that
he
lives
in
a
different
world
from
yours
then
go
wash
your
windows
and
instead
of
longing
for
some
other
world
you
will
discover
the
wonderful
beauties
of
this
world
and
if
you
do
find
transcendent
beauties
on
every
hand
here
the
chances
are
that
you
will
never
find
them
anywhere
the
poem
hangs
on
the
when
comes
the
poet
eye
and
the
whole
street
is
a
masquerade
when
shakspeare
passes
by
this
same
shakspeare
whose
mere
passing
causes
all
this
commotion
is
the
one
who
put
into
the
mouth
of
one
of
his
creations
the
words
the
fault
dear
brutus
is
not
in
our
stars
but
in
ourselves
that
we
are
underlings
and
the
great
work
of
his
own
life
is
right
good
evidence
that
he
realized
full
well
the
truth
of
the
facts
we
are
considering
and
again
he
gave
us
a
great
truth
in
keeping
with
what
we
are
considering
when
he
said
our
doubts
are
traitors
and
make
us
lose
the
good
we
oft
might
win
by
to
attempt
there
is
probably
no
agent
that
brings
us
more
undesirable
conditions
than
fear
we
should
live
in
fear
of
nothing
nor
will
we
when
we
come
fully
to
know
ourselves
an
old
french
proverb
runs
some
of
your
griefs
you
have
cured
and
the
sharpest
you
still
have
survived
but
what
of
you
endured
from
evils
that
never
arrived
fear
and
lack
of
faith
go
hand
in
hand
the
one
is
born
of
the
other
tell
me
how
much
one
is
given
to
fear
and
i
will
tell
you
how
much
he
lacks
in
faith
fear
is
a
most
expensive
guest
to
entertain
the
same
as
worry
is
so
expensive
are
they
that
no
one
can
afford
to
entertain
them
invite
what
we
fear
the
same
as
by
a
different
attitude
of
mind
we
invite
and
attract
the
influences
and
conditions
we
the
mind
dominated
by
fear
opens
the
door
for
the
entrance
of
the
very
things
for
the
actualization
of
the
very
conditions
it
fears
where
are
you
going
asked
an
eastern
pilgrim
on
meeting
the
plague
one
day
i
am
going
to
bagdad
to
kill
five
thousand
people
was
the
reply
a
few
days
later
the
same
pilgrim
met
the
plague
returning
you
told
me
you
were
going
to
bagdad
to
kill
five
thousand
people
said
he
but
instead
you
killed
fifty
thousand
no
said
the
plague
killed
only
five
as
i
told
you
i
would
others
died
of
fear
can
paralyze
every
muscle
in
the
body
fear
affects
the
flow
of
the
blood
likewise
the
normal
and
healthy
action
of
all
the
life
forces
fear
can
make
the
body
rigid
motionless
and
powerless
to
move
not
only
do
we
attract
to
ourselves
the
things
we
fear
but
we
also
aid
in
attracting
to
others
the
conditions
we
in
our
own
minds
hold
them
in
fear
of
this
we
do
in
proportion
to
the
strength
of
our
own
thought
and
in
the
degree
that
they
are
sensitively
organized
and
so
influenced
by
our
thought
and
this
although
it
be
unconscious
both
on
their
part
and
on
ours
children
and
especially
when
very
young
are
generally
speaking
more
sensitive
to
their
surrounding
influences
than
grown
people
are
some
are
veritable
little
sensitive
plates
registering
the
influences
about
them
and
embodying
them
as
they
grow
how
careful
in
their
prevailing
mental
states
then
should
be
those
who
have
them
in
charge
and
especially
how
careful
should
a
mother
be
during
the
time
she
is
carrying
the
child
and
when
every
thought
every
mental
as
well
as
emotional
state
has
its
direct
influence
upon
the
life
of
the
unborn
child
let
parents
be
careful
how
they
hold
a
child
either
younger
or
older
in
the
thought
of
fear
this
is
many
times
done
unwittingly
on
their
part
through
anxiety
and
at
times
through
what
might
well
be
termed
which
is
fully
as
bad
as
i
know
of
a
number
of
cases
where
a
child
has
been
so
continually
held
in
the
thought
of
fear
lest
this
or
that
condition
come
upon
him
that
the
very
things
that
were
feared
have
been
drawn
to
him
which
probably
otherwise
never
would
have
come
at
all
many
times
there
has
been
no
adequate
basis
for
the
fear
in
case
there
is
a
basis
then
far
wiser
is
it
to
take
exactly
the
opposite
attitude
so
as
to
neutralize
the
force
at
work
and
then
to
hold
the
child
in
the
thought
of
wisdom
and
strength
that
it
may
be
able
to
meet
the
condition
and
master
it
instead
of
being
mastered
by
it
but
a
day
or
two
ago
a
friend
was
telling
me
of
an
experience
of
his
own
life
in
this
connection
at
a
period
when
he
was
having
a
terrific
struggle
with
a
certain
habit
he
was
so
continually
held
in
the
thought
of
fear
by
his
mother
and
the
young
lady
to
whom
he
was
engaged
the
engagement
to
be
consummated
at
the
end
of
a
certain
period
the
time
depending
on
his
proving
his
mastery
that
he
very
sensitively
organized
felt
the
depressing
and
weakening
effects
of
their
negative
thoughts
he
could
always
tell
exactly
how
they
felt
toward
him
he
was
continually
influenced
and
weakened
by
their
fear
by
their
questionings
by
their
suspicions
all
of
which
had
the
effect
of
lessening
the
sense
of
his
own
power
all
of
which
had
an
influence
upon
him
and
so
instead
of
their
begetting
courage
and
strength
in
him
they
brought
him
to
a
still
greater
realization
of
his
own
weakness
and
the
almost
worthless
use
of
struggle
here
were
two
who
loved
him
dearly
and
who
would
have
done
anything
and
everything
to
help
him
gain
the
mastery
but
who
ignorant
of
the
silent
subtle
and
power
of
the
thought
forces
instead
of
imparting
to
him
courage
instead
of
adding
to
his
strength
disarmed
him
of
this
and
then
added
an
additional
weakness
from
without
in
this
way
the
battle
for
him
was
made
harder
in
a
degree
fear
and
worry
and
all
kindred
mental
states
are
too
expensive
for
any
person
man
woman
or
child
to
entertain
or
indulge
in
fear
paralyzes
healthy
action
worry
corrodes
and
pulls
down
the
organism
and
will
finally
tear
it
to
pieces
nothing
is
to
be
gained
by
it
but
everything
to
be
lost
grief
at
any
loss
will
do
the
same
each
brings
its
own
peculiar
type
of
ailment
an
inordinate
love
of
gain
a
hoarding
disposition
will
have
kindred
effects
anger
jealousy
malice
continual
lust
has
each
its
own
peculiar
corroding
weakening
effects
we
shall
find
that
not
only
are
happiness
and
prosperity
concomitants
of
righteousness
living
in
harmony
with
the
higher
laws
but
bodily
health
as
well
the
great
hebrew
seer
enunciated
a
wonderful
chemistry
of
life
when
he
said
as
righteousness
tendeth
to
life
so
he
that
pursueth
evil
pursueth
it
to
his
own
death
on
the
other
hand
in
the
way
of
righteousness
is
life
and
in
the
pathway
thereof
there
is
no
death
the
time
will
come
when
it
will
be
seen
that
this
means
far
more
than
most
people
dare
to
think
as
it
rests
with
man
to
say
whether
his
soul
shall
be
housed
in
a
stately
mansion
of
splendor
and
beauty
or
in
a
hovel
of
his
own
building
a
hovel
at
last
ruined
and
abandoned
to
decay
the
bodies
of
almost
untold
numbers
living
their
unbalanced
lives
are
every
year
through
these
influences
weakening
and
falling
by
the
wayside
long
before
their
time
poor
poor
houses
intended
to
be
beautiful
temples
brought
to
desolation
by
their
ignorant
reckless
deluded
tenants
poor
houses
a
close
observer
a
careful
student
of
the
power
of
the
thought
forces
will
soon
be
able
to
read
in
the
voice
in
the
movements
in
the
features
the
effects
registered
by
the
prevailing
mental
states
and
conditions
or
if
he
is
told
the
prevailing
mental
states
and
conditions
he
can
describe
the
voice
the
movements
the
features
as
well
as
describe
in
a
general
way
the
peculiar
physical
ailments
their
possessor
is
heir
to
we
are
told
by
good
authority
that
a
study
of
the
human
body
its
structure
and
the
length
of
time
it
takes
it
to
come
to
maturity
in
comparison
with
the
time
it
takes
the
bodies
of
various
animals
and
their
corresponding
longevity
reveals
the
fact
that
its
natural
age
should
be
nearer
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
than
what
we
commonly
find
it
today
but
think
of
the
multitudes
all
about
us
whose
bodies
are
aging
weakening
breaking
so
that
they
have
to
abandon
them
long
before
they
reach
what
ought
to
be
a
long
period
of
strong
vigorous
middle
life
then
the
natural
length
of
life
being
thus
shortened
it
comes
to
be
what
we
might
term
a
race
belief
that
this
shortened
period
is
the
natural
period
and
as
a
consequence
many
when
they
approach
a
certain
age
seeing
that
as
a
rule
people
at
this
period
of
life
begin
to
show
signs
of
age
to
break
and
go
down
hill
as
we
say
they
thinking
it
a
matter
of
course
and
that
it
must
be
the
same
with
them
by
taking
this
attitude
of
mind
many
times
bring
upon
themselves
these
very
conditions
long
before
it
is
necessary
subtle
and
powerful
are
the
influences
of
the
mind
in
the
building
and
rebuilding
of
the
body
as
we
understand
them
better
it
may
become
the
custom
for
people
to
look
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
teens
of
their
second
century
there
comes
to
mind
at
this
moment
a
friend
a
lady
well
on
to
eighty
years
of
age
an
old
lady
some
most
people
in
fact
would
call
her
especially
those
who
measure
age
by
the
number
of
the
seasons
that
have
come
and
gone
since
one
birth
but
to
call
our
friend
old
would
be
to
call
black
white
she
is
no
older
than
a
girl
of
and
indeed
younger
i
am
glad
to
say
or
i
am
sorry
to
say
depending
upon
the
point
of
view
than
a
girl
of
this
age
seeking
for
the
good
in
all
people
and
in
all
things
she
has
found
the
good
everywhere
the
brightness
of
disposition
and
of
voice
that
is
hers
today
that
attracts
all
people
to
her
and
that
makes
her
so
beautifully
attractive
to
all
people
has
characterized
her
all
through
life
it
has
in
turn
carried
brightness
and
hope
and
courage
and
strength
to
hundreds
and
thousands
of
people
through
all
these
years
and
will
continue
to
do
so
apparently
for
many
years
yet
to
come
no
fears
no
worryings
no
hatreds
no
jealousies
no
sorrowings
no
grievings
no
sordid
graspings
after
inordinant
transcriber
note
inordinate
gain
have
found
entrance
into
her
realm
of
thought
as
a
consequence
her
mind
free
from
these
abnormal
states
and
conditions
has
not
externalized
in
her
body
the
various
physical
ailments
that
the
great
majority
of
people
are
lugging
about
with
them
thinking
in
their
ignorance
that
they
are
natural
and
that
it
is
all
in
accordance
with
the
eternal
order
of
things
that
they
should
have
them
her
life
has
been
one
of
varied
experiences
so
that
all
these
things
would
have
found
ready
entrance
into
the
realm
of
her
mind
and
so
into
her
life
were
she
ignorant
enough
to
allow
them
entrance
on
the
contrary
she
has
been
wise
enough
to
recognize
the
fact
that
in
one
kingdom
at
least
she
is
ruler
the
kingdom
of
her
mind
and
that
it
is
hers
to
dictate
as
to
what
shall
and
what
shall
not
enter
there
she
knows
moreover
that
in
determining
this
she
is
determining
all
the
conditions
of
her
life
it
is
indeed
a
pleasure
as
well
as
an
inspiration
to
see
her
as
she
goes
here
and
there
to
see
her
sunny
disposition
her
youthful
step
to
hear
her
joyous
laughter
indeed
and
in
truth
shakspeare
knew
whereof
he
spoke
when
he
said
it
is
the
mind
that
makes
the
body
rich
with
great
pleasure
i
watched
her
but
recently
as
she
was
walking
along
the
street
stopping
to
have
a
word
and
so
a
part
in
the
lives
of
a
group
of
children
at
play
by
the
wayside
hastening
her
step
a
little
to
have
a
word
with
a
washerwoman
toting
her
bundle
of
clothes
stopping
for
a
word
with
a
laboring
man
returning
with
dinner
pail
in
hand
from
his
work
returning
the
recognition
from
the
lady
in
her
carriage
and
so
imparting
some
of
her
own
rich
life
to
all
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
and
as
good
fortune
would
have
it
while
still
watching
her
an
old
lady
passed
her
really
old
this
one
though
at
least
ten
or
fifteen
years
younger
so
far
as
the
count
by
the
seasons
is
concerned
nevertheless
she
was
bent
in
form
and
apparently
stiff
in
joint
and
muscle
silent
in
mood
she
wore
a
countenance
of
sadness
which
was
intensified
surely
several
fold
by
a
black
sombre
headgear
with
an
immense
heavy
veil
still
more
sombre
looking
if
possible
her
entire
dress
was
of
this
description
by
this
garb
combined
with
her
own
mood
and
expression
she
continually
proclaimed
to
the
world
two
things
her
own
personal
sorrows
and
woes
which
by
this
very
method
she
kept
continually
fresh
in
her
mind
and
also
her
lack
of
faith
in
the
eternal
goodness
of
things
her
lack
of
faith
in
the
love
and
eternal
goodness
of
the
infinite
father
wrapped
only
in
the
thoughts
of
her
own
ailments
and
sorrows
and
woes
she
received
and
she
gave
nothing
of
joy
nothing
of
hope
nothing
of
courage
nothing
of
value
to
those
whom
she
passed
or
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
but
on
the
contrary
she
suggested
to
all
and
helped
to
intensify
in
many
those
mental
states
all
too
prevalent
in
our
common
human
life
and
as
she
passed
our
friend
one
could
notice
a
slight
turn
of
the
head
which
coupled
with
the
expression
in
her
face
seemed
to
indicate
this
as
her
thought
your
dress
and
your
conduct
are
not
wholly
in
keeping
with
a
lady
of
your
years
thank
god
then
thank
god
they
are
not
and
may
he
in
his
great
goodness
and
love
send
us
an
innumerable
company
of
the
same
rare
type
and
may
they
live
a
thousand
years
to
bless
mankind
to
impart
the
influences
of
their
own
royal
lives
to
the
numerous
ones
all
about
us
who
stand
so
much
in
need
of
them
would
you
remain
always
young
and
would
you
carry
all
the
joyousness
and
buoyancy
of
youth
into
your
maturer
years
then
have
care
concerning
but
one
thing
how
you
live
in
your
thought
world
this
will
determine
all
it
was
the
inspired
one
gautama
the
buddha
who
said
the
mind
is
everything
what
you
think
you
become
and
the
same
thing
had
ruskin
in
mind
when
he
said
make
yourself
nests
of
pleasant
thoughts
none
of
us
as
yet
know
for
none
of
us
have
been
taught
in
early
youth
what
fairy
palaces
we
may
build
of
beautiful
thought
against
all
and
would
you
have
in
your
body
all
the
elasticity
all
the
strength
all
the
beauty
of
your
younger
years
then
live
these
in
your
mind
making
no
room
for
unclean
thought
and
you
will
externalize
them
in
your
body
in
the
degree
that
you
keep
young
in
thought
will
you
remain
young
in
body
and
you
will
find
that
your
body
will
in
turn
aid
your
mind
for
body
helps
mind
the
same
as
mind
builds
body
you
are
continually
building
and
so
externalizing
in
your
body
conditions
most
akin
to
the
thoughts
and
emotions
you
entertain
and
not
only
are
you
so
building
from
within
but
you
are
also
continually
drawing
from
without
forces
of
a
kindred
nature
your
particular
kind
of
thought
connects
you
with
a
similar
order
of
thought
from
without
if
it
is
bright
hopeful
cheerful
you
connect
yourself
with
a
current
of
thought
of
this
nature
if
it
is
sad
fearing
despondent
then
this
is
the
order
of
thought
you
connect
yourself
with
if
the
latter
is
the
order
of
your
thought
then
perhaps
unconsciously
and
by
degrees
you
have
been
connecting
yourself
with
it
you
need
to
go
back
and
pick
up
again
a
part
of
your
child
nature
with
its
careless
and
cheerful
type
of
thought
the
minds
of
the
group
of
children
at
play
are
unconsciously
concentrated
in
drawing
to
their
bodies
a
current
of
playful
thought
place
a
child
by
itself
deprive
it
of
its
companions
and
soon
it
will
mope
and
become
slow
of
movement
it
is
cut
off
from
that
peculiar
thought
current
and
is
literally
of
its
element
you
need
to
bring
again
this
current
of
playful
thought
to
you
which
has
gradually
been
turned
off
you
are
too
serious
or
sad
or
absorbed
in
the
serious
affairs
of
life
you
can
be
playful
and
cheerful
without
being
puerile
or
silly
you
can
carry
on
business
all
the
better
for
being
in
the
playful
mood
when
your
mind
is
off
your
business
there
is
nothing
but
ill
resulting
from
the
permanent
mood
of
sadness
and
seriousness
the
mood
which
by
many
so
long
maintained
makes
it
actually
difficult
for
them
to
smile
at
all
at
eighteen
or
twenty
you
commenced
growing
out
of
the
more
playful
tendency
of
early
youth
you
took
hold
of
the
more
serious
side
of
life
you
went
into
some
business
you
became
more
or
less
involved
in
its
cares
perplexities
and
responsibilities
or
as
man
or
woman
you
entered
on
some
phase
of
life
involving
care
or
trouble
or
you
became
absorbed
in
some
game
of
business
which
as
you
followed
it
left
no
time
for
play
then
as
you
associated
with
older
people
you
absorbed
their
old
ideas
their
mechanical
methods
of
thinking
their
acceptance
of
errors
without
question
or
thought
of
question
in
all
this
you
opened
your
mind
to
a
heavy
current
of
thought
into
this
you
glided
unconsciously
that
thought
is
materialized
in
your
blood
and
flesh
the
seen
of
your
body
is
a
deposit
or
crystallization
of
the
unseen
element
ever
flowing
to
your
body
from
your
mind
years
pass
on
and
you
find
that
your
movements
are
stiff
and
cumbrous
that
you
can
with
difficulty
climb
a
tree
as
at
fourteen
your
mind
has
all
this
time
been
sending
to
your
body
these
heavy
inelastic
elements
making
your
body
what
now
it
is
your
change
for
the
better
must
be
gradual
and
can
only
be
accomplished
by
bringing
the
thought
current
of
an
symmetrical
strength
to
bear
on
it
by
demanding
of
the
supreme
power
to
be
led
in
the
best
way
by
diverting
your
mind
from
the
many
unhealthy
thoughts
which
habitually
have
been
flowing
into
it
without
your
knowing
it
to
healthier
ones
like
the
beast
the
bodies
of
those
of
our
race
have
in
the
past
weakened
and
decayed
this
will
not
always
be
increase
of
spiritual
knowledge
will
show
the
cause
of
such
decay
and
will
show
also
how
to
take
advantage
of
a
law
or
force
to
build
us
up
renew
ever
the
body
and
give
it
greater
and
greater
strength
instead
of
blindly
using
that
law
or
force
as
has
been
done
in
the
past
to
weaken
our
bodies
and
finally
destroy
them
full
rich
and
abounding
health
is
the
normal
and
the
natural
condition
of
life
anything
else
is
an
abnormal
condition
and
abnormal
conditions
as
a
rule
come
through
perversions
god
never
created
sickness
suffering
and
disease
they
are
man
own
creations
they
come
through
his
violating
the
laws
under
which
he
lives
so
used
are
we
to
seeing
them
that
we
come
gradually
if
not
to
think
of
them
as
natural
then
to
look
upon
them
as
a
matter
of
course
the
time
will
come
when
the
work
of
the
physician
will
not
be
to
treat
and
attempt
to
heal
the
body
but
to
heal
the
mind
which
in
turn
will
heal
the
body
in
other
words
the
true
physician
will
be
a
teacher
his
work
will
be
to
keep
people
well
instead
of
attempting
to
make
them
well
after
sickness
and
disease
comes
on
and
still
beyond
this
there
will
come
a
time
when
each
will
be
his
own
physician
in
the
degree
that
we
live
in
harmony
with
the
higher
laws
of
our
being
and
so
in
the
degree
that
we
become
better
acquainted
with
the
powers
of
the
mind
and
spirit
will
we
give
less
attention
to
the
body
no
less
but
less
the
bodies
of
thousands
today
would
be
much
better
cared
for
if
their
owners
gave
them
less
thought
and
attention
as
a
rule
those
who
think
least
of
their
bodies
enjoy
the
best
health
many
are
kept
in
continual
ill
health
by
the
abnormal
thought
and
attention
they
give
them
give
the
body
the
nourishment
the
exercise
the
fresh
air
the
sunlight
it
requires
keep
it
clean
and
then
think
of
it
as
little
as
possible
in
your
thoughts
and
in
your
conversation
never
dwell
upon
the
negative
side
do
talk
of
sickness
and
disease
by
talking
of
these
you
do
yourself
harm
and
you
do
harm
to
those
who
listen
to
you
talk
of
those
things
that
will
make
people
the
better
for
listening
to
you
thus
you
will
infect
them
with
health
and
strength
and
not
with
weakness
and
disease
to
dwell
upon
the
negative
side
is
always
destructive
this
is
true
of
the
body
the
same
as
it
is
true
of
all
other
things
the
following
from
one
whose
thorough
training
as
a
physician
has
been
supplemented
by
extensive
study
and
observations
along
the
lines
of
the
powers
of
the
interior
forces
are
of
special
significance
and
value
in
this
connection
we
can
never
gain
health
by
contemplating
disease
any
more
than
we
can
reach
perfection
by
dwelling
upon
imperfection
or
harmony
through
discord
we
should
keep
a
high
ideal
of
health
and
harmony
constantly
before
the
mind
never
affirm
or
repeat
about
your
health
what
you
do
not
wish
to
be
true
do
not
dwell
upon
your
ailments
nor
study
your
symptoms
never
allow
yourself
to
be
convinced
that
you
are
not
complete
master
of
yourself
stoutly
affirm
your
superiority
over
bodily
ills
and
do
not
acknowledge
yourself
the
slave
of
any
inferior
power
i
would
teach
children
early
to
build
a
strong
barrier
between
themselves
and
disease
by
healthy
habits
of
thought
high
thinking
and
purity
of
life
i
would
teach
them
to
expel
all
thoughts
of
death
all
images
of
disease
all
discordant
emotions
like
hatred
malice
revenge
envy
and
sensuality
as
they
would
banish
a
temptation
to
do
evil
i
would
teach
them
that
bad
food
bad
drink
or
bad
air
makes
bad
blood
that
bad
blood
makes
bad
tissue
and
bad
flesh
bad
morals
i
would
teach
them
that
healthy
thoughts
are
as
essential
to
healthy
bodies
as
pure
thoughts
to
a
clean
life
i
would
teach
them
to
cultivate
a
strong
will
power
and
to
brace
themselves
against
life
enemies
in
every
possible
way
i
would
teach
the
sick
to
have
hope
confidence
cheer
our
thoughts
and
imaginations
are
the
only
real
limits
to
our
possibilities
no
man
success
or
health
will
ever
reach
beyond
his
own
confidence
as
a
rule
we
erect
our
own
barriers
like
produces
like
the
universe
through
hatred
envy
malice
jealousy
and
revenge
all
have
children
every
bad
thought
breeds
others
and
each
of
these
goes
on
and
on
ever
reproducing
itself
until
our
world
is
peopled
with
their
offspring
the
true
physician
and
parent
of
the
future
will
not
medicate
the
body
with
drugs
so
much
as
the
mind
with
principles
the
coming
mother
will
teach
her
child
to
assuage
the
fever
of
anger
hatred
malice
with
the
great
panacea
of
the
world
love
the
coming
physician
will
teach
the
people
to
cultivate
cheerfulness
and
noble
deeds
for
a
health
tonic
as
well
as
a
heart
tonic
and
that
a
merry
heart
doeth
good
like
a
medicine
the
health
of
your
body
the
same
as
the
health
and
strength
of
your
mind
depends
upon
what
you
relate
yourself
with
this
infinite
spirit
of
life
this
source
of
all
life
can
from
its
very
nature
we
have
found
admit
of
no
weakness
no
disease
come
then
into
the
full
conscious
vital
realization
of
your
oneness
with
this
infinite
life
open
yourself
to
its
more
abundant
entrance
and
full
and
bodily
health
and
strength
will
be
yours
and
good
may
ever
conquer
ill
health
walk
where
pain
has
trod
a
man
thinketh
so
is
he
rise
then
and
think
with
god
the
whole
matter
may
then
be
summed
up
in
the
one
sentence
god
is
well
and
so
are
you
you
must
awaken
to
the
knowledge
of
your
when
this
awakening
comes
you
will
have
and
you
will
see
that
you
have
the
power
to
determine
what
conditions
are
externalized
in
your
body
you
must
recognize
you
must
realize
yourself
as
one
with
infinite
spirit
god
will
is
then
your
will
your
will
is
will
and
with
god
all
things
are
possible
when
we
are
able
to
do
away
with
all
sense
of
separateness
by
living
continually
in
the
realization
of
this
oneness
not
only
will
our
bodily
ills
and
weaknesses
vanish
but
all
limitations
along
all
lines
then
delight
thyself
in
the
lord
and
he
shall
give
thee
the
desires
of
thine
heart
then
will
you
feel
like
crying
all
the
day
long
the
lines
are
fallen
unto
me
in
pleasant
places
yea
i
have
a
goodly
heritage
drop
out
of
mind
your
belief
in
good
things
and
good
events
coming
to
you
in
the
future
come
into
the
real
life
and
coming
appropriate
and
actualize
them
remember
that
only
the
best
is
good
enough
for
one
with
a
heritage
so
royal
as
yours
we
buy
ashes
for
bread
we
buy
diluted
wine
give
me
the
true
whose
ample
leaves
and
tendrils
curled
among
the
silver
hills
of
heaven
draw
everlasting
dew
the
secret
power
and
effects
of
love
this
is
the
spirit
of
infinite
love
the
moment
we
recognize
ourselves
as
one
with
it
we
become
so
filled
with
love
that
we
see
only
the
good
in
all
and
when
we
realize
that
we
are
all
one
with
this
infinite
spirit
then
we
realize
that
in
a
sense
we
are
all
one
with
each
other
when
we
come
into
a
recognition
of
this
fact
we
can
then
do
no
harm
to
any
one
to
any
thing
we
find
that
we
are
all
members
of
the
one
great
body
and
that
no
portion
of
the
body
can
be
harmed
without
all
the
other
portions
suffering
thereby
when
we
fully
realize
the
great
fact
of
the
oneness
of
all
life
that
all
are
partakers
from
this
one
infinite
source
and
so
that
the
same
life
is
the
life
in
each
individual
then
prejudices
go
and
hatreds
cease
love
grows
and
reigns
supreme
then
wherever
we
go
whenever
we
come
in
contact
with
the
we
are
able
to
recognize
the
god
within
we
thus
look
only
for
the
good
and
we
find
it
it
always
pays
there
is
a
deep
scientific
fact
underlying
the
great
truth
he
that
takes
the
sword
shall
perish
by
the
sword
the
moment
we
come
into
a
realization
of
the
subtle
powers
of
the
thought
forces
we
can
quickly
see
that
the
moment
we
entertain
any
thoughts
of
hatred
toward
another
he
gets
the
effects
of
these
diabolical
forces
that
go
out
from
us
and
has
the
same
thoughts
of
hatred
aroused
in
him
which
in
turn
return
to
the
sender
then
when
we
understand
the
effects
of
the
passion
hatred
or
anger
even
upon
the
physical
body
we
can
see
how
detrimental
how
expensive
this
is
the
same
is
true
in
regard
to
all
kindred
thoughts
or
passions
envy
criticism
jealousy
scorn
in
the
ultimate
we
shall
find
that
in
entertaining
feelings
of
this
nature
toward
another
we
always
suffer
far
more
than
the
one
toward
whom
we
entertain
them
and
then
when
we
fully
realize
the
fact
that
selfishness
is
at
the
root
of
all
error
sin
and
crime
and
that
ignorance
is
the
basis
of
all
selfishness
with
what
charity
we
come
to
look
upon
the
acts
of
all
it
is
the
ignorant
man
who
seeks
his
own
ends
at
the
expense
of
the
greater
whole
it
is
the
ignorant
man
therefore
who
is
the
selfish
man
the
truly
wise
man
is
never
selfish
he
is
a
seer
and
recognizes
the
fact
that
he
a
single
member
of
the
one
great
body
is
benefited
in
just
the
degree
that
the
entire
body
is
benefited
and
so
he
seeks
nothing
for
himself
that
he
would
not
equally
seek
for
all
mankind
if
selfishness
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
error
sin
and
crime
and
ignorance
is
the
basis
of
all
selfishness
then
when
we
see
a
manifestation
of
either
of
these
qualities
if
we
are
true
to
the
highest
within
us
we
will
look
for
and
will
seek
to
call
forth
the
good
in
each
individual
with
whom
we
come
in
contact
when
god
speaks
to
god
then
god
responds
and
shows
forth
as
god
but
when
devil
speaks
to
devil
then
devil
responds
and
the
devil
is
always
to
pay
i
sometimes
hear
a
person
say
i
do
see
any
good
in
him
no
then
you
are
no
seer
look
deeper
and
you
will
find
the
very
god
in
every
human
soul
but
remember
it
takes
a
god
to
recognize
a
god
christ
always
spoke
to
the
highest
the
truest
and
the
best
in
men
he
knew
and
he
recognized
the
god
in
each
because
he
had
first
realized
it
in
himself
he
ate
with
publicans
and
sinners
abominable
the
scribes
and
pharisees
said
they
were
so
wrapped
up
in
their
own
conceits
their
own
hence
their
own
ignorance
that
they
had
never
found
the
god
in
themselves
and
so
they
never
dreamed
that
it
was
the
real
life
of
even
publicans
and
sinners
in
the
degree
that
we
hold
a
person
in
the
thought
of
evil
or
of
error
do
we
suggest
evil
and
error
to
him
in
the
degree
that
he
is
sensitively
organized
or
not
well
individualized
and
so
subject
to
the
suggestions
of
the
thought
forces
from
others
will
he
be
influenced
and
so
in
this
way
we
may
be
sharers
in
the
very
in
which
we
hold
another
in
thought
in
the
same
way
when
we
hold
a
person
in
the
thought
of
the
right
the
good
and
the
true
righteousness
goodness
and
truth
are
suggested
to
him
and
thus
we
have
a
most
beneficent
influence
on
his
life
and
conduct
if
our
hearts
go
out
in
love
to
all
with
whom
we
come
in
contact
we
inspire
love
and
the
same
ennobling
and
warming
influences
of
love
always
return
to
us
from
those
in
whom
we
inspire
them
there
is
a
deep
scientific
principle
underlying
the
precept
if
you
would
have
all
the
world
love
you
you
must
first
love
all
the
world
in
the
degree
that
we
love
will
we
be
loved
thoughts
are
forces
each
creates
of
its
kind
each
comes
back
laden
with
the
effect
that
corresponds
to
itself
and
of
which
it
is
the
cause
then
let
your
secret
thoughts
be
fair
they
have
a
vital
part
and
share
in
shaping
words
and
moulding
fate
god
system
is
so
intricate
i
know
of
no
better
practice
than
that
of
a
friend
who
continually
holds
himself
in
an
attitude
of
mind
that
he
continually
sends
out
his
love
in
the
form
of
the
thought
dear
everybody
i
love
you
and
when
we
realize
the
fact
that
a
thought
invariably
produces
its
effect
before
it
returns
or
before
it
ceases
we
can
see
how
he
is
continually
breathing
out
a
blessing
not
only
upon
all
with
whom
he
comes
in
contact
but
upon
all
the
world
these
same
thoughts
of
love
moreover
tokened
in
various
ways
are
continually
coming
to
him
from
all
quarters
even
animals
feel
the
effects
of
these
forces
some
animals
are
much
more
sensitively
organized
than
many
people
are
and
consequently
they
get
the
effects
of
our
thoughts
our
mental
states
and
emotions
much
more
readily
than
many
people
do
therefore
whenever
we
meet
an
animal
we
can
do
it
good
by
sending
out
to
it
these
thoughts
of
love
it
will
feel
the
effects
whether
we
simply
entertain
or
whether
we
voice
them
and
it
is
often
interesting
to
note
how
quickly
it
responds
and
how
readily
it
gives
evidence
of
its
appreciation
of
this
love
and
consideration
on
our
part
what
a
privilege
and
how
enjoyable
it
would
be
to
live
and
walk
in
a
world
where
we
meet
only
gods
in
such
a
world
you
can
live
in
such
a
world
i
can
live
for
in
the
degree
that
we
come
into
this
higher
realization
do
we
see
only
the
god
in
each
human
soul
and
when
we
are
thus
able
to
see
him
in
every
one
we
meet
we
then
live
in
such
a
world
and
when
we
thus
recognize
the
god
in
every
one
we
by
this
recognition
help
to
call
it
forth
ever
more
and
more
what
a
privilege
this
privilege
of
yours
this
privilege
of
mine
that
hypocritical
judging
of
another
is
something
then
with
which
we
can
have
nothing
to
do
for
we
have
the
power
of
looking
beyond
the
evolving
changing
self
and
seeing
the
real
the
changeless
the
eternal
self
which
by
and
by
will
show
forth
in
the
full
beauty
of
holiness
we
are
then
large
enough
also
to
realize
the
fact
that
when
we
condemn
another
by
that
very
act
we
condemn
ourselves
this
realization
so
fills
us
with
love
that
we
continually
overflow
it
and
all
with
whom
we
come
in
contact
feel
its
warming
and
power
these
in
turn
send
back
the
same
feelings
of
love
to
us
and
so
we
continually
attract
love
from
all
quarters
tell
me
how
much
one
loves
and
i
will
tell
you
how
much
he
has
seen
of
god
tell
me
how
much
he
loves
and
i
will
tell
you
how
much
he
lives
with
god
tell
me
how
much
he
loves
and
i
will
tell
you
how
far
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
kingdom
of
harmony
he
has
entered
for
love
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
and
in
a
sense
love
is
everything
it
is
the
key
to
life
and
its
influences
are
those
that
move
the
world
live
only
in
the
thought
of
love
for
all
and
you
will
draw
love
to
you
from
all
live
in
the
thought
of
malice
or
hatred
and
malice
and
hatred
will
come
back
to
you
for
evil
poisons
malice
shafts
like
boomerangs
return
inflicting
wounds
that
will
not
heal
while
rage
and
anger
burn
every
thought
you
entertain
is
a
force
that
goes
out
and
every
thought
comes
back
laden
with
its
kind
this
is
an
immutable
law
every
thought
you
entertain
has
moreover
a
direct
effect
upon
your
body
love
and
its
kindred
emotions
are
the
normal
and
the
natural
those
in
accordance
with
the
eternal
order
of
the
universe
for
god
is
love
these
have
a
influence
upon
your
body
besides
beautifying
your
countenance
enriching
your
voice
and
making
you
ever
more
attractive
in
every
way
and
as
it
is
true
that
in
the
degree
that
you
hold
thoughts
of
love
for
all
you
call
the
same
from
them
in
return
and
as
these
have
a
direct
effect
upon
your
mind
and
through
your
mind
upon
your
body
it
is
as
so
much
life
force
added
to
your
own
from
without
you
are
then
continually
building
this
into
both
your
mental
and
your
physical
life
and
so
your
life
is
enriched
by
its
influence
hatred
and
all
its
kindred
emotions
are
the
unnatural
the
abnormal
the
perversions
and
so
out
of
harmony
with
the
eternal
order
of
the
universe
for
if
love
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
then
these
its
opposites
are
direct
violations
of
law
and
there
can
never
be
a
violation
of
law
without
its
attendant
pain
and
suffering
in
one
form
or
another
there
is
no
escape
from
this
and
what
is
the
result
of
this
particular
form
of
violation
when
you
allow
thoughts
of
anger
hatred
malice
jealousy
envy
criticism
or
scorn
to
exercise
sway
they
have
a
corroding
and
poisoning
effect
upon
the
organism
they
pull
it
down
and
if
allowed
to
continue
will
eventually
tear
it
to
pieces
by
externalizing
themselves
in
the
particular
forms
of
disease
they
give
rise
to
and
then
in
addition
to
the
destructive
influences
from
your
own
mind
you
are
continually
calling
the
same
influences
from
other
minds
and
these
come
as
destructive
forces
augmenting
your
own
thus
aiding
in
the
tearing
down
process
and
so
love
inspires
love
hatred
breeds
hatred
love
and
good
will
stimulate
and
build
up
the
body
hatred
and
malice
corrode
and
tear
it
down
love
is
a
savor
of
life
unto
life
hatred
is
a
savor
of
death
unto
death
there
are
loyal
hearts
there
are
spirits
brave
there
are
souls
that
are
pure
and
true
then
give
to
the
world
the
best
you
have
and
the
best
will
come
back
to
you
give
love
and
love
to
heart
will
flow
a
strength
in
your
utmost
need
have
faith
and
a
score
of
hearts
will
show
their
faith
in
word
and
deed
i
hear
it
said
how
in
regard
to
one
who
bears
me
hatred
towards
whom
i
have
entertained
no
such
thoughts
and
feelings
and
so
have
not
been
the
cause
of
his
becoming
my
enemy
this
may
be
true
but
the
chances
are
that
you
will
have
but
few
enemies
if
there
is
nothing
of
an
antagonistic
nature
in
your
own
mind
and
heart
be
sure
there
is
nothing
of
this
nature
but
if
hatred
should
come
from
another
without
apparent
cause
on
your
part
then
meet
it
from
first
to
last
with
thoughts
of
love
and
in
this
way
you
can
so
to
speak
so
neutralize
its
effects
that
it
can
not
reach
you
and
so
can
not
harm
you
love
is
positive
and
stronger
than
hatred
hatred
can
always
be
conquered
by
love
on
the
other
hand
if
you
meet
hatred
with
hatred
you
simply
intensify
it
you
add
fuel
to
the
flame
already
kindled
upon
which
it
will
feed
and
grow
and
so
you
increase
and
intensify
the
evil
conditions
nothing
is
to
be
gained
by
it
everything
is
to
be
lost
by
sending
love
for
hatred
you
will
be
able
so
to
neutralize
it
that
it
will
not
only
have
no
effect
upon
you
but
will
not
be
able
even
to
reach
you
but
more
than
this
you
will
by
this
course
sooner
or
later
be
able
literally
to
transmute
the
enemy
into
the
friend
meet
hatred
with
hatred
and
you
degrade
yourself
meet
hatred
with
love
and
you
elevate
not
only
yourself
but
also
the
one
who
bears
you
hatred
the
persian
sage
has
said
always
meet
petulance
with
gentleness
and
perverseness
with
kindness
a
gentle
hand
can
lead
even
an
elephant
by
a
hair
reply
to
thine
enemy
with
gentleness
opposition
to
peace
is
sin
the
buddhist
says
if
a
man
foolishly
does
me
wrong
i
will
return
him
the
protection
of
my
ungrudging
love
the
more
evil
comes
from
him
the
more
good
shall
go
from
me
the
wise
man
avenges
injuries
by
benefits
says
the
chinese
return
good
for
evil
overcome
anger
by
love
hatred
never
ceases
by
hatred
but
by
love
says
the
hindu
the
truly
wise
man
or
woman
will
recognize
no
one
as
an
enemy
occasionally
we
hear
the
expression
never
mind
i
get
even
with
him
will
you
and
how
will
you
do
it
you
can
do
it
in
one
of
two
ways
you
can
as
you
have
in
mind
deal
with
him
as
he
deals
or
apparently
deals
with
you
pay
him
as
we
say
in
his
own
coin
if
you
do
this
you
will
get
even
with
him
by
sinking
yourself
to
his
level
and
both
of
you
will
suffer
by
it
or
you
can
show
yourself
the
larger
you
can
send
him
love
for
hatred
kindness
for
and
so
get
even
with
him
by
raising
him
to
the
higher
level
but
remember
that
you
can
never
help
another
without
by
that
very
act
helping
yourself
and
if
forgetful
of
self
then
in
most
all
cases
the
value
to
you
is
greater
than
the
service
you
render
another
if
you
are
ready
to
treat
him
as
he
treats
you
then
you
show
clearly
that
there
is
in
you
that
which
draws
the
hatred
and
to
you
you
deserve
what
you
are
getting
and
should
not
complain
nor
would
you
complain
if
you
were
wise
by
following
the
other
course
you
most
effectually
accomplish
your
purpose
you
gain
a
victory
for
yourself
and
at
the
same
time
you
do
a
great
service
for
him
for
which
it
is
evident
he
stands
greatly
in
need
thus
you
may
become
his
saviour
he
in
turn
may
become
the
saviour
of
other
and
consequently
men
and
women
many
times
the
struggles
are
greater
than
we
can
ever
know
we
need
more
gentleness
and
sympathy
and
compassion
in
our
common
human
life
then
we
will
neither
blame
nor
condemn
instead
of
blaming
or
condemning
we
will
sympathize
and
all
the
more
we
will
comfort
one
another
for
the
way
is
often
dreary
and
the
feet
are
often
weary
and
the
heart
is
very
sad
there
is
a
heavy
burden
bearing
when
it
seems
that
none
are
caring
and
we
half
forget
that
ever
we
were
glad
comfort
one
another
with
the
close
and
tender
with
the
sweetness
love
can
render
and
the
looks
of
friendly
eyes
do
not
wait
with
grace
unspoken
while
life
daily
bread
is
broken
gentle
speech
is
oft
like
manna
from
the
skies
when
we
come
fully
to
realize
the
great
fact
that
all
evil
and
error
and
sin
with
all
their
consequent
sufferings
come
through
ignorance
then
wherever
we
see
a
manifestation
of
these
in
whatever
form
if
our
hearts
are
right
we
will
have
compassion
sympathy
and
compassion
for
the
one
in
whom
we
see
them
compassion
will
then
change
itself
into
love
and
love
will
manifest
itself
in
kindly
service
such
is
the
divine
method
and
so
instead
of
aiding
in
trampling
and
keeping
a
weaker
one
down
we
will
hold
him
up
until
he
can
stand
alone
and
become
the
master
but
all
is
from
within
out
and
one
becomes
a
true
master
in
the
degree
that
the
knowledge
of
the
divinity
of
his
own
nature
dawns
upon
his
inner
consciousness
and
so
brings
him
to
a
knowledge
of
the
higher
laws
and
in
no
way
can
we
so
effectually
hasten
this
dawning
in
the
inner
consciousness
of
another
as
by
showing
forth
the
divinity
within
ourselves
simply
by
the
way
we
live
by
example
and
not
by
precept
by
living
not
by
preaching
by
doing
not
by
professing
by
living
the
life
not
by
dogmatizing
as
to
how
it
should
be
lived
there
is
no
contagion
equal
to
the
contagion
of
life
whatever
we
sow
that
shall
we
also
reap
and
each
thing
sown
produces
of
its
kind
we
can
kill
not
only
by
doing
another
bodily
injury
directly
but
we
can
and
we
do
kill
by
every
antagonistic
thought
not
only
do
we
thus
kill
but
while
we
kill
we
suicide
many
a
man
has
been
made
sick
by
having
the
ill
thoughts
of
a
number
of
people
centred
upon
him
some
have
been
actually
killed
put
hatred
into
the
world
and
we
make
it
a
literal
hell
put
love
into
the
world
and
heaven
with
all
its
beauties
and
glories
becomes
a
reality
not
to
love
is
not
to
live
or
it
is
to
live
a
living
death
the
life
that
goes
out
in
love
to
all
is
the
life
that
is
full
and
rich
and
continually
expanding
in
beauty
and
in
power
such
is
the
life
that
becomes
ever
more
inclusive
and
hence
larger
in
its
scope
and
influence
the
larger
the
man
and
the
woman
the
more
inclusive
they
are
in
their
love
and
their
friendships
the
smaller
the
man
and
the
woman
the
more
dwarfed
and
dwindling
their
natures
the
more
they
pride
themselves
upon
their
exclusiveness
any
one
a
fool
or
an
idiot
can
be
exclusive
it
comes
easy
it
takes
and
it
signifies
a
large
nature
to
be
universal
to
be
inclusive
only
the
man
or
the
woman
of
a
small
personal
nature
is
exclusive
the
man
or
the
woman
of
a
large
royal
nature
never
is
the
small
nature
is
the
one
that
continually
strives
for
effect
the
larger
nature
never
does
the
one
goes
here
and
there
in
order
to
gain
recognition
in
order
to
attach
himself
to
the
world
the
other
stays
at
home
and
draws
the
world
the
one
loves
merely
himself
the
other
loves
all
the
world
but
in
his
larger
love
for
all
the
world
he
finds
himself
included
verily
then
the
more
one
loves
the
nearer
he
approaches
to
god
for
god
is
the
spirit
of
infinite
love
and
when
we
come
into
the
realization
of
our
oneness
with
this
infinite
spirit
then
divine
love
so
fills
us
that
enriching
and
enrapturing
our
own
lives
from
them
it
flows
out
to
enrich
the
life
of
all
the
world
in
coming
into
the
realization
of
our
oneness
with
the
infinite
life
we
are
brought
at
once
into
right
relations
with
our
fellowmen
we
are
brought
into
harmony
with
the
great
law
that
we
find
our
own
lives
in
losing
them
in
the
service
of
others
we
are
brought
to
a
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
all
life
is
one
and
so
that
we
are
all
parts
of
the
one
great
whole
we
then
realize
that
we
ca
do
for
another
without
at
the
same
time
doing
for
ourselves
we
also
realize
that
we
can
not
do
harm
to
another
without
by
that
very
act
doing
harm
to
ourselves
we
realize
that
the
man
who
lives
to
himself
alone
lives
a
little
dwarfed
and
stunted
life
because
he
has
no
part
in
this
larger
life
of
humanity
but
the
one
who
in
service
loses
his
own
life
in
this
larger
life
has
his
own
life
increased
and
enriched
a
thousand
or
a
million
fold
and
every
joy
every
happiness
everything
of
value
coming
to
each
member
of
this
greater
whole
comes
as
such
to
him
for
he
has
a
part
in
the
life
of
each
and
all
and
here
let
a
word
be
said
in
regard
to
true
service
peter
and
john
were
one
day
going
up
to
the
temple
and
as
they
were
entering
the
gate
they
were
met
by
a
poor
cripple
who
asked
them
for
alms
instead
of
giving
him
something
to
supply
the
day
needs
and
then
leaving
him
in
the
same
dependent
condition
for
the
morrow
and
the
morrow
peter
did
him
a
real
service
and
a
real
service
for
all
mankind
by
saying
silver
and
gold
have
i
none
but
such
as
i
have
i
give
unto
thee
then
he
made
him
he
thus
brought
him
into
the
condition
where
he
could
help
himself
in
other
words
the
greatest
service
we
can
do
for
another
is
to
help
him
to
help
himself
to
help
him
directly
might
be
weakening
though
not
necessarily
it
depends
entirely
upon
circumstances
but
to
help
one
to
help
himself
is
never
weakening
but
always
encouraging
and
strengthening
because
it
leads
him
to
a
larger
and
stronger
life
there
is
no
better
way
to
help
one
to
help
himself
than
to
bring
him
to
a
knowledge
of
himself
there
is
no
better
way
to
bring
one
to
a
knowledge
of
himself
than
to
lead
him
to
a
knowledge
of
the
powers
that
are
lying
dormant
within
his
own
soul
there
is
nothing
that
will
enable
him
to
come
more
readily
or
more
completely
into
an
awakened
knowledge
of
the
powers
that
are
lying
dormant
within
his
own
soul
than
to
bring
him
into
the
conscious
vital
realization
of
his
oneness
with
the
infinite
life
and
power
so
that
he
may
open
himself
to
it
in
order
that
it
may
work
and
manifest
through
him
we
will
find
that
these
same
great
truths
lie
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
solution
of
our
social
situation
and
we
will
also
find
that
we
will
never
have
a
full
and
permanent
solution
of
it
until
they
are
fully
recognized
and
built
upon
wisdom
and
interior
illumination
this
is
the
spirit
of
infinite
wisdom
and
in
the
degree
that
we
open
ourselves
to
it
does
the
highest
wisdom
manifest
itself
to
and
through
us
we
can
in
this
way
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
universe
itself
and
find
the
mysteries
hidden
to
the
majority
of
mankind
hidden
to
them
though
not
hidden
of
themselves
in
order
for
the
highest
wisdom
and
insight
we
must
have
absolute
confidence
in
the
divine
guiding
us
but
not
through
the
channel
of
some
one
else
and
why
should
we
go
to
another
for
knowledge
and
wisdom
with
god
is
no
respect
of
persons
why
should
we
seek
these
things
second
hand
why
should
we
thus
stultify
our
own
innate
powers
why
should
we
not
go
direct
to
the
infinite
source
itself
if
any
man
lack
wisdom
let
him
ask
of
god
before
they
call
i
will
answer
and
while
they
are
yet
speaking
i
will
hear
when
we
thus
go
directly
to
the
infinite
source
itself
we
are
no
longer
slaves
to
personalities
institutions
or
books
we
should
always
keep
ourselves
open
to
suggestions
of
truth
from
these
agencies
we
should
always
regard
them
as
agencies
however
and
never
as
sources
we
should
never
recognize
them
as
masters
but
simply
as
teachers
with
browning
we
must
recognize
the
great
fact
that
truth
is
within
ourselves
it
takes
no
rise
from
outward
things
you
may
believe
there
is
an
inmost
centre
in
us
all
where
truth
abides
in
fullness
there
is
no
more
important
injunction
in
all
the
world
nor
one
with
a
deeper
interior
meaning
than
to
thine
own
self
be
true
in
other
words
be
true
to
your
own
soul
for
it
is
through
your
own
soul
that
the
voice
of
god
speaks
to
you
this
is
the
interior
guide
this
is
the
light
that
lighteth
every
man
that
cometh
into
the
world
this
is
conscience
this
is
intuition
this
is
the
voice
of
the
higher
self
the
voice
of
the
soul
the
voice
of
god
thou
shalt
hear
a
voice
behind
thee
saying
this
is
the
way
walk
ye
in
it
when
moses
was
on
the
mountain
it
was
after
the
various
physical
commotions
and
manifestations
that
he
heard
the
still
small
voice
the
voice
of
his
own
soul
through
which
the
infinite
god
was
speaking
if
we
will
but
follow
this
voice
of
intuition
it
will
speak
ever
more
clearly
and
more
plainly
until
by
and
by
it
will
be
absolute
and
unerring
in
its
guidance
the
great
trouble
with
us
is
that
we
do
not
listen
to
and
do
not
follow
this
voice
within
our
own
souls
and
so
we
become
as
a
house
divided
against
itself
we
are
pulled
this
way
and
that
and
we
are
never
of
anything
i
have
a
friend
who
listens
so
carefully
to
this
inner
voice
who
in
other
words
always
acts
so
quickly
and
so
fully
in
accordance
with
his
intuitions
and
whose
life
as
a
consequence
is
so
absolutely
guided
by
them
that
he
always
does
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
and
in
the
right
way
he
always
knows
when
to
act
and
how
to
act
and
he
is
never
in
the
condition
of
a
house
divided
against
itself
but
some
one
says
may
it
not
be
dangerous
for
us
to
act
always
upon
our
intuitions
suppose
we
should
have
an
intuition
to
do
harm
to
some
one
we
need
not
be
afraid
of
this
however
for
the
voice
of
the
soul
this
voice
of
god
speaking
through
the
soul
will
never
direct
one
to
do
harm
to
another
nor
to
do
anything
that
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
highest
standards
of
right
and
truth
and
justice
and
if
you
at
any
time
have
a
prompting
of
this
kind
know
that
it
is
not
the
voice
of
intuition
it
is
some
characteristic
of
your
lower
self
that
is
prompting
you
reason
is
not
to
be
set
aside
but
it
is
to
be
continually
illumined
by
this
higher
spiritual
perception
and
in
the
degree
that
it
is
thus
illumined
will
it
become
an
agent
of
light
and
power
when
one
becomes
thoroughly
individualized
he
enters
into
the
realm
of
all
knowledge
and
wisdom
and
to
be
individualized
is
to
recognize
no
power
outside
of
the
infinite
power
that
is
back
of
all
when
one
recognizes
this
great
fact
and
opens
himself
to
this
spirit
of
infinite
wisdom
he
then
enters
upon
the
road
to
the
true
education
and
mysteries
that
before
were
closed
now
reveal
themselves
to
him
this
must
indeed
be
the
foundation
of
all
true
education
this
evolving
from
within
this
evolving
of
what
has
been
involved
by
the
infinite
power
all
things
that
it
is
valuable
for
us
to
know
will
come
to
us
if
we
will
but
open
ourselves
to
the
voice
of
this
infinite
spirit
it
is
thus
that
we
become
seers
and
have
the
power
of
seeing
into
the
very
heart
of
things
there
are
no
new
stars
there
are
no
new
laws
or
forces
but
we
can
so
open
ourselves
to
this
spirit
of
infinite
wisdom
that
we
can
discover
and
recognize
those
that
have
not
been
known
before
and
in
this
way
they
become
new
to
us
when
in
this
way
we
come
into
a
knowledge
of
truth
we
no
longer
need
facts
that
are
continually
changing
we
can
then
enter
into
the
quiet
of
our
own
interior
selves
we
can
open
the
window
and
look
out
and
thus
gather
the
facts
as
we
choose
this
is
true
wisdom
wisdom
is
the
knowledge
of
god
wisdom
comes
by
intuition
it
far
transcends
knowledge
great
knowledge
knowledge
of
many
things
may
be
had
by
virtue
simply
of
a
very
retentive
memory
it
comes
by
tuition
but
wisdom
far
transcends
knowledge
in
that
knowledge
is
a
mere
incident
of
this
deeper
wisdom
he
who
would
enter
into
the
realm
of
wisdom
must
first
divest
himself
of
all
intellectual
pride
he
must
become
as
a
little
child
prejudices
preconceived
opinions
and
beliefs
always
stand
in
the
way
of
true
wisdom
conceited
opinions
are
always
suicidal
in
their
influences
they
bar
the
door
to
the
entrance
of
truth
all
about
us
we
see
men
in
the
religious
world
in
the
world
of
science
in
the
political
in
the
social
world
who
through
intellectual
pride
are
so
wrapped
in
their
own
conceits
and
prejudices
that
larger
and
later
revelations
of
truth
can
find
no
entrance
to
them
and
instead
of
growing
and
expanding
they
are
becoming
dwarfed
and
stunted
and
still
more
incapable
of
receiving
truth
instead
of
actively
aiding
in
the
progress
of
the
world
they
are
as
so
many
dead
sticks
in
the
way
that
would
retard
the
wheels
of
progress
this
however
they
can
never
do
such
always
in
time
get
bruised
broken
and
left
behind
while
triumphal
car
of
truth
moves
steadily
onward
when
the
steam
engine
was
still
being
experimented
with
and
before
it
was
perfected
sufficiently
to
come
into
practical
use
a
englishman
well
known
then
in
scientific
circles
wrote
an
extended
pamphlet
proving
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
it
ever
to
be
used
in
ocean
navigation
that
is
in
a
trip
involving
the
crossing
of
the
ocean
because
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
any
vessel
to
carry
with
it
sufficient
coal
for
the
use
of
its
furnace
and
the
interesting
feature
of
the
whole
matter
was
that
the
very
first
steam
vessel
that
made
the
trip
from
england
to
america
had
among
its
cargo
a
part
of
the
first
edition
of
this
carefully
prepared
pamphlet
there
was
only
the
one
edition
many
editions
might
be
sold
now
this
seems
indeed
an
amusing
fact
but
far
more
amusing
is
the
man
who
voluntarily
closes
himself
to
truth
because
forsooth
it
does
not
come
through
conventional
or
orthodox
or
heretofore
accepted
channels
or
because
it
may
not
be
in
full
accord
with
or
possibly
may
be
opposed
to
established
usages
or
beliefs
on
the
contrary
let
there
be
many
windows
in
your
soul
that
all
the
glory
of
the
universe
may
beautify
it
not
the
narrow
pane
of
one
poor
creed
can
catch
the
radiant
rays
that
shine
from
countless
sources
tear
away
the
blinds
of
superstition
let
the
light
pour
through
fair
windows
broad
as
truth
itself
and
high
as
heaven
tune
your
ear
to
all
the
worldless
music
of
the
stars
and
to
the
voice
of
nature
and
your
heart
shall
turn
to
truth
and
goodness
as
the
plant
turns
to
the
sun
a
thousand
unseen
hands
reach
down
to
help
you
to
their
heights
and
all
the
forces
of
the
firmament
shall
fortify
your
strength
be
not
afraid
to
thrust
aside
and
grasp
the
whole
there
is
a
great
law
in
connection
with
the
coming
of
truth
it
is
this
whenever
a
man
or
a
woman
shuts
himself
or
herself
to
the
entrance
of
truth
on
account
of
intellectual
pride
preconceived
opinions
prejudices
or
for
whatever
reason
there
is
a
great
law
which
says
that
truth
its
will
come
to
that
one
from
no
source
and
on
the
other
hand
when
a
man
or
a
woman
opens
himself
or
herself
fully
to
the
entrance
of
truth
from
source
it
may
come
there
is
an
equally
great
law
which
says
that
truth
will
flow
in
to
him
or
to
her
from
all
sources
from
all
quarters
such
becomes
the
free
man
the
free
woman
for
it
is
the
truth
that
makes
us
free
the
other
remains
in
bondage
for
truth
has
had
no
invitation
and
will
not
enter
where
it
is
not
fully
and
freely
welcomed
and
where
truth
is
denied
entrance
the
rich
blessings
it
carries
with
it
can
not
take
up
their
abode
on
the
contrary
when
this
is
the
case
it
sends
an
envoy
carrying
with
it
atrophy
disease
death
physically
and
spiritually
as
well
as
intellectually
and
the
man
who
would
rob
another
of
his
free
and
unfettered
search
for
truth
who
would
stand
as
the
interpreter
of
truth
for
another
with
the
intent
of
remaining
in
this
position
rather
than
endeavoring
to
lead
him
to
the
place
where
he
can
be
his
own
interpreter
is
more
to
be
shunned
than
a
thief
and
a
robber
the
injury
he
works
is
far
greater
for
he
is
doing
direct
and
positive
injury
to
the
very
life
of
the
one
he
thus
holds
who
has
ever
appointed
any
man
whoever
he
may
be
as
the
keeper
the
custodian
the
dispenser
of
god
illimitable
truth
many
indeed
are
moved
and
so
are
called
to
be
teachers
of
truth
but
the
true
teacher
will
never
stand
as
the
interpreter
of
truth
for
another
the
is
the
one
whose
endeavor
is
to
bring
the
one
he
teaches
to
a
true
knowledge
of
himself
and
hence
of
his
own
interior
powers
that
he
may
become
his
own
interpreter
all
others
are
generally
speaking
those
animated
by
purely
personal
motives
or
personal
gain
moreover
he
who
would
claim
to
have
all
truth
and
the
only
truth
is
a
bigot
a
fool
or
a
knave
in
the
eastern
literature
is
a
fable
of
a
frog
the
frog
lived
in
a
well
and
out
of
his
little
well
he
had
never
been
one
day
a
frog
whose
home
was
in
the
sea
came
to
his
well
interested
in
all
things
he
went
in
who
are
you
where
do
you
live
said
the
frog
in
the
well
i
am
so
and
so
and
my
home
is
in
the
sea
the
sea
what
is
that
where
is
that
it
is
a
very
large
body
of
water
and
not
far
away
how
big
is
your
sea
oh
very
big
as
big
as
this
pointing
to
a
little
stone
lying
near
oh
much
bigger
as
big
as
this
pointing
to
the
board
upon
which
they
were
sitting
oh
much
bigger
how
much
bigger
then
why
the
sea
in
which
i
live
is
bigger
than
your
entire
well
it
would
make
millions
of
wells
such
as
yours
nonsense
nonsense
you
are
a
deceiver
and
a
falsifier
get
out
of
my
well
get
out
of
my
well
i
want
nothing
to
do
with
any
such
frogs
as
you
ye
shall
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
free
is
the
promise
ye
shall
close
yourselves
to
truth
ye
shall
live
in
your
own
conceits
and
your
own
conceits
shall
make
fools
and
idiots
of
you
would
be
a
statement
applicable
to
not
a
few
and
to
not
a
few
who
pride
themselves
upon
their
superior
intellectual
attainments
idiocy
is
arrested
mental
growth
closing
one
self
for
whatever
reason
to
truth
and
hence
to
growth
brings
a
certain
type
of
idiocy
though
it
may
not
be
called
by
this
name
and
on
the
other
hand
another
type
is
that
arrested
growth
caused
by
taking
all
things
for
granted
without
proving
them
for
one
self
merely
because
they
come
from
a
particular
person
a
particular
book
a
particular
institution
this
is
caused
by
always
looking
without
instead
of
being
true
to
the
light
within
and
carefully
tending
it
that
it
may
give
an
light
with
brave
and
intrepid
walt
whitman
we
should
all
be
able
to
say
from
this
hour
i
ordain
myself
loos
of
limits
and
imaginary
lines
going
where
i
list
my
own
master
total
and
absolute
listening
to
others
considering
well
what
they
say
pausing
searching
receiving
contemplating
gently
but
with
undeniable
will
divesting
myself
of
the
holds
that
would
hold
me
great
should
be
the
joy
that
god
boundless
truth
is
open
to
all
open
to
all
and
that
it
will
make
each
one
its
dwelling
place
in
proportion
as
he
earnestly
desires
it
and
opens
himself
to
it
and
in
regard
to
the
wisdom
that
guides
us
in
our
daily
life
there
is
nothing
that
it
is
right
and
well
for
us
to
know
that
may
not
be
known
when
we
recognize
the
law
of
its
coming
and
are
able
wisely
to
use
it
let
us
know
that
all
things
are
ours
as
soon
as
we
know
how
to
appropriate
them
i
hold
it
as
a
changeless
law
from
which
no
soul
can
sway
or
swerve
we
have
that
in
us
which
will
draw
we
need
or
most
deserve
if
the
times
come
when
we
know
not
what
course
to
pursue
when
we
know
not
which
way
to
turn
the
fault
lies
in
ourselves
if
the
fault
lies
in
ourselves
then
the
correction
of
this
unnatural
condition
lies
also
in
ourselves
it
is
never
necessary
to
come
into
such
a
state
if
we
are
awake
and
remain
awake
to
the
light
and
the
powers
within
us
the
light
is
ever
shining
and
the
only
thing
that
it
is
necessary
for
us
diligently
to
see
to
is
that
we
permit
neither
this
thing
nor
that
to
come
between
us
and
the
light
with
thee
is
the
fountain
of
life
in
thy
light
shall
we
see
light
let
us
hear
the
words
of
one
of
the
most
highly
illumined
men
i
have
ever
known
and
one
who
as
a
consequence
is
never
in
the
dark
when
the
time
comes
as
to
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
whenever
you
are
in
doubt
as
to
the
course
you
should
pursue
after
you
have
turned
to
every
outward
means
of
guidance
the
inward
eye
see
let
the
inward
ear
and
allow
this
simple
natural
beautiful
process
to
go
on
unimpeded
by
questionings
or
doubts
in
all
dark
hours
and
times
of
unwonted
perplexity
we
need
to
follow
one
simple
direction
found
as
all
needed
directions
can
be
found
in
the
dear
old
gospel
which
so
many
read
but
alas
few
into
thine
inner
chamber
and
shut
the
door
does
this
mean
that
we
must
literally
betake
ourselves
to
a
private
closet
with
a
key
in
the
door
if
it
did
then
the
command
could
never
be
obeyed
in
the
open
air
on
land
or
sea
and
the
christ
loved
the
lakes
and
the
forests
far
better
than
the
cramping
rooms
of
city
dwelling
houses
still
his
counsels
are
so
that
there
is
no
spot
on
earth
and
no
conceivable
situation
in
which
any
of
us
may
be
placed
where
we
can
not
follow
them
one
of
the
most
intuitive
men
we
ever
met
had
a
desk
in
a
city
office
where
several
other
gentlemen
were
doing
business
constantly
and
often
talking
loudly
entirely
undisturbed
by
the
many
various
sounds
about
him
this
faithful
man
would
in
any
moment
of
perplexity
draw
the
curtains
of
privacy
so
completely
about
him
that
he
would
be
as
fully
enclosed
in
his
own
psychic
aura
and
thereby
as
effectually
removed
from
all
distractions
as
though
he
were
alone
in
some
primeval

taking
his
difficulty
with
him
into
the
mystic
silence
in
the
form
of
a
direct
question
to
which
he
expected
a
certain
answer
he
would
remain
utterly
passive
until
the
reply
came
and
never
once
through
many
years
experience
did
he
find
himself
disappointed
or
misled
intuitive
perceptions
of
truth
are
the
daily
bread
to
satisfy
our
daily
hunger
they
come
like
the
manna
in
the
desert
day
by
day
each
day
brings
adequate
supply
for
that
day
need
only
they
must
be
followed
instantly
for
dalliance
with
them
means
their
obscuration
and
the
more
we
dally
the
more
we
invite
erroneous
impressions
to
cover
intuition
with
a
pall
of
conflicting
moral
phantasy
born
of
illusions
of
the
terrence
will
one
condition
is
imposed
by
and
this
we
must
obey
put
all
wishes
aside
save
the
one
desire
to
know
couple
with
this
one
demand
the
fully
consecrated
determination
to
follow
what
is
distinctly
perceived
as
truth
immediately
it
is
revealed
no
other
affection
must
be
permitted
to
share
the
field
with
this
love
of
for
its
own
sake
obey
this
one
direction
and
never
forget
that
expectation
and
desire
are
bride
and
bridegroom
and
forever
inseparable
and
you
will
soon
find
your
hitherto
darkened
way
grow
luminous
with
celestial
radiance
for
with
the
heaven
within
all
heavens
without
incessantly
this
may
be
termed
going
into
the
silence
this
it
is
to
perceive
and
to
be
guided
by
the
light
that
lighteth
every
man
that
cometh
into
the
world
this
it
is
to
listen
to
and
be
guided
by
the
voice
of
your
own
soul
the
voice
of
your
higher
self
the
soul
is
divine
and
in
allowing
it
to
become
translucent
to
the
infinite
spirit
it
reveals
all
things
to
us
as
man
turns
away
from
the
divine
light
do
all
things
become
hidden
there
is
nothing
hidden
of
itself
when
the
spiritual
sense
is
opened
then
it
transcends
all
the
limitations
of
the
physical
senses
and
the
intellect
and
in
the
degree
that
we
are
able
to
get
away
from
the
limitations
set
by
them
and
realize
that
so
far
as
the
real
life
is
concerned
it
is
one
with
the
infinite
life
then
we
begin
to
reach
the
place
where
this
voice
will
always
speak
where
it
will
never
fail
us
if
we
follow
it
and
as
a
consequence
where
we
will
always
have
the
divine
illumination
and
guidance
to
know
this
and
to
live
in
this
realization
is
not
to
live
in
heaven
hereafter
but
to
live
in
heaven
here
and
now
and
every
no
human
soul
need
be
without
it
when
we
turn
our
face
in
the
right
direction
it
comes
as
simply
and
as
naturally
as
the
flower
blooms
and
the
winds
blow
it
is
not
to
be
bought
with
money
or
with
price
it
is
a
condition
waiting
simply
to
be
realized
by
rich
and
by
poor
by
king
and
by
peasant
by
master
and
by
servant
the
world
over
all
are
equal
heirs
to
it
and
so
the
peasant
if
he
find
it
first
lives
a
life
far
transcending
in
beauty
and
in
real
power
the
life
of
his
king
the
servant
if
he
find
it
first
lives
a
life
surpassing
the
life
of
his
master
if
you
would
find
the
highest
the
fullest
and
the
richest
life
that
not
only
this
world
but
that
any
world
can
know
then
do
away
with
the
sense
of
the
separateness
of
your
life
from
the
life
of
god
hold
to
the
thought
of
your
oneness
in
the
degree
that
you
do
this
you
will
find
yourself
realizing
it
more
and
more
and
as
this
life
of
realization
is
lived
you
will
find
that
no
good
thing
will
be
withheld
for
all
things
are
included
in
this
then
it
will
be
yours
without
fears
or
forebodings
simply
to
do
today
what
your
hands
find
to
do
and
so
be
ready
for
tomorrow
it
knowing
that
tomorrow
will
bring
tomorrow
supplies
for
the
mental
the
spiritual
and
the
physical
life
remember
however
that
tomorrow
supplies
are
not
needed
until
tomorrow
comes
if
one
is
willing
to
trust
himself
to
the
law
the
law
will
never
fail
him
it
is
the
trusting
to
it
that
brings
uncertain
and
so
unsatisfactory
results
nothing
is
firmer
and
surer
than
deity
it
will
never
fail
the
one
who
throws
himself
wholly
upon
it
the
secret
of
life
then
is
to
live
continually
in
this
realization
whatever
one
may
be
doing
wherever
one
may
be
by
day
and
by
night
both
waking
and
sleeping
it
can
be
lived
in
while
we
are
sleeping
no
less
than
when
we
are
awake
and
here
shall
we
consider
a
few
facts
in
connection
with
sleep
in
connection
with
receiving
instruction
and
illumination
while
asleep
during
the
process
of
sleep
it
is
merely
the
physical
body
that
is
at
rest
and
in
quiet
the
soul
life
with
all
its
activities
goes
right
on
sleep
is
nature
provision
for
the
recuperation
of
the
body
for
the
rebuilding
and
hence
the
replacing
of
the
waste
that
is
continually
going
on
during
the
waking
hours
it
is
nature
great
restorer
if
sufficient
sleep
is
not
allowed
the
body
so
that
the
rebuilding
may
equalize
the
wasting
process
the
body
is
gradually
depleted
and
weakened
and
any
ailment
or
malady
when
it
is
in
this
condition
is
able
to
find
a
more
ready
entrance
it
is
for
this
reason
that
those
who
are
subject
to
it
will
take
a
cold
as
we
term
it
more
readily
when
the
body
is
tired
or
exhausted
through
loss
of
sleep
than
at
most
any
other
time
the
body
is
in
that
condition
where
outside
influences
can
have
a
more
ready
effect
upon
it
than
when
it
is
in
its
normal
condition
and
when
they
do
have
an
effect
they
always
go
to
the
weaker
portions
first
our
bodies
are
given
us
to
serve
far
higher
purposes
than
we
ordinarily
use
them
for
especially
is
this
true
in
the
numerous
cases
where
the
body
is
master
of
its
owner
in
the
degree
that
we
come
into
the
realization
of
the
higher
powers
of
the
mind
and
spirit
in
that
degree
does
the
body
through
their
influence
upon
it
become
less
gross
and
heavy
finer
in
its
texture
and
form
and
then
because
the
mind
finds
a
kingdom
of
enjoyment
in
itself
and
in
all
the
higher
things
it
becomes
related
to
in
eating
and
drinking
as
well
as
all
others
naturally
and
of
their
own
accord
fall
away
there
also
falls
away
the
desire
for
the
heavier
grosser
less
valuable
kinds
of
food
and
drink
such
as
the
flesh
of
animals
alcoholic
drinks
and
all
things
of
the
class
that
stimulate
the
body
and
the
passions
rather
than
build
the
body
and
the
brain
into
a
strong
clean
enduring
and
fibrous
condition
in
the
degree
that
the
body
thus
becomes
less
gross
and
heavy
finer
in
its
texture
and
form
is
there
less
waste
and
what
there
is
is
more
easily
replaced
so
that
it
keeps
in
a
more
regular
and
even
condition
when
this
is
true
less
sleep
is
actually
required
and
even
the
amount
that
is
taken
does
more
for
a
body
of
this
finer
type
than
it
can
do
for
one
of
the
other
nature
as
the
body
in
this
way
grows
finer
in
other
words
as
the
process
of
its
evolution
is
thus
accelerated
it
in
turn
helps
the
mind
and
the
soul
in
the
realization
of
ever
higher
perceptions
and
thus
body
helps
mind
the
same
as
mind
builds
body
it
was
undoubtedly
this
fact
that
browning
had
in
mind
when
he
said
let
us
cry
good
things
are
ours
nor
soul
helps
flesh
more
now
than
flesh
helps
soul
sleep
then
is
for
the
resting
and
the
rebuilding
of
the
body
the
soul
needs
no
rest
and
while
the
body
is
at
rest
in
sleep
the
soul
life
is
active
the
same
as
when
the
body
is
in
activity
there
are
some
having
a
deep
insight
into
the
soul
activities
who
say
that
we
travel
when
we
sleep
some
are
able
to
recall
and
bring
over
into
the
conscious
waking
life
the
scenes
visited
the
information
gained
and
the
events
that
have
transpired
most
people
are
not
able
to
do
this
and
so
much
that
might
otherwise
be
gained
is
lost
they
say
however
that
it
is
in
our
power
in
proportion
as
we
understand
the
laws
to
go
where
we
will
and
to
bring
over
into
the
conscious
waking
life
all
the
experiences
thus
gained
be
this
however
as
it
may
it
certainly
is
true
that
while
sleeping
we
have
the
power
in
a
perfectly
normal
and
natural
way
to
get
much
of
value
by
way
of
light
instruction
and
growth
that
the
majority
of
people
now
miss
if
the
soul
life
that
which
relates
us
to
infinite
spirit
is
always
active
even
while
the
body
is
at
rest
why
may
not
the
mind
so
direct
conditions
as
one
falls
asleep
that
while
the
body
is
at
rest
it
may
continually
receive
illumination
from
the
soul
and
bring
what
it
thus
receives
over
into
the
conscious
waking
life
this
indeed
can
be
done
and
is
done
by
some
to
great
advantage
and
many
times
the
highest
inspirations
from
the
soul
come
in
this
way
as
would
seem
most
natural
since
at
this
time
all
communications
from
the
outer
material
world
no
longer
enter
i
know
those
who
do
much
work
during
sleep
the
same
as
they
get
much
light
along
desired
lines
by
charging
the
mind
on
going
to
sleep
as
to
a
particular
time
for
waking
it
is
possible
as
many
of
us
know
to
wake
on
the
very
minute
not
infrequently
we
have
examples
of
difficult
problems
problems
that
defied
solution
during
waking
hours
being
solved
during
sleep
a
friend
a
journalist
had
an
extended
newspaper
article
clearly
and
completely
worked
out
for
her
in
this
way
she
frequently
calls
this
agency
to
her
aid
she
was
notified
by
the
managing
editor
one
evening
to
have
the
article
ready
in
the
morning
an
article
requiring
more
than
ordinary
care
and
one
in
which
quite
a
knowledge
of
facts
was
required
it
was
a
matter
in
connection
with
which
she
knew
scarcely
anything
and
all
her
efforts
at
finding
information
regarding
it
seemed
to
be
of
no
avail
she
set
to
work
but
it
seemed
as
if
even
her
own
powers
defied
her
failure
seemed
imminent
almost
in
desperation
she
decided
to
retire
and
putting
the
matter
into
her
mind
in
such
a
way
that
she
would
be
able
to
receive
the
greatest
amount
of
aid
while
asleep
she
fell
asleep
and
slept
soundly
until
morning
when
she
awoke
her
work
of
the
previous
evening
was
the
first
thing
that
came
into
her
mind
she
lay
quietly
for
a
few
minutes
and
as
she
lay
there
the
article
completely
written
seemed
to
stand
before
her
mind
she
ran
through
it
arose
and
without
dressing
took
her
pen
and
transcribed
it
on
to
paper
literally
acting
simply
as
her
own
amanuensis
the
mind
acting
intently
along
a
particular
line
will
continue
so
to
act
until
some
other
object
of
thought
carries
it
along
another
line
and
since
in
sleep
only
the
body
is
in
quiet
while
the
mind
and
soul
are
active
then
the
mind
on
being
given
a
certain
direction
when
one
drops
off
to
sleep
will
take
up
the
line
along
which
it
is
directed
and
can
be
made
in
time
to
bring
over
into
consciousness
the
results
of
its
activities
some
will
be
able
very
soon
to
get
results
of
this
kind
for
some
it
will
take
longer
quiet
and
continued
effort
will
increase
the
faculty
then
by
virtue
of
the
law
of
the
drawing
power
of
mind
since
the
mind
is
always
active
we
are
drawing
to
us
even
while
sleeping
influences
from
the
realms
kindred
to
those
in
which
we
in
our
thoughts
are
living
before
we
fall
asleep
in
this
way
we
can
put
ourselves
into
relation
with
what
ever
kinds
of
influence
we
choose
and
accordingly
gain
much
during
the
process
of
sleep
in
many
ways
the
interior
faculties
are
more
open
and
receptive
while
we
are
in
sleep
than
while
we
are
awake
hence
the
necessity
of
exercising
even
greater
care
as
to
the
nature
of
the
thoughts
that
occupy
the
mind
as
we
enter
into
sleep
for
there
can
come
to
us
only
what
we
by
our
own
order
of
thought
attract
we
have
it
entirely
in
our
own
hands
and
for
the
same
reason
this
greater
degree
of
receptivity
during
this
period
we
are
able
by
understanding
and
using
the
law
to
gain
much
of
value
more
readily
in
this
way
than
when
the
physical
senses
are
fully
open
to
the
material
world
about
us
many
will
find
a
practice
somewhat
after
the
following
nature
of
value
when
light
or
information
is
desired
along
any
particular
line
light
or
information
you
feel
it
is
right
and
wise
for
you
to
have
as
for
example
light
in
regard
to
an
uncertain
course
of
action
then
as
you
retire
first
bring
your
mind
into
the
attitude
of
peace
and
for
all
you
in
this
way
bring
yourself
into
an
harmonious
condition
and
in
turn
attract
to
yourself
these
same
peaceful
conditions
from
without
then
resting
in
this
sense
of
peace
quietly
and
calmly
send
out
your
earnest
desire
for
the
needed
light
or
information
cast
out
of
your
mind
all
fears
or
forebodings
lest
it
come
not
for
in
quietness
and
in
confidence
shall
be
your
strength
take
the
expectant
attitude
of
mind
firmly
believing
and
expecting
that
when
you
awake
the
desired
results
will
be
with
you
then
on
awaking
before
any
thoughts
or
activities
from
the
outside
world
come
in
to
absorb
the
attention
remain
for
a
little
while
receptive
to
the
intuitions
or
the
impressions
that
come
when
they
come
when
they
manifest
themselves
clearly
then
act
upon
them
without
delay
in
the
degree
that
you
do
this
in
that
degree
will
the
power
of
doing
it
ever
more
effectively
grow
or
if
for
unselfish
purposes
you
desire
to
grow
and
develop
any
of
your
faculties
or
to
increase
the
health
and
strength
of
your
body
take
a
corresponding
attitude
of
mind
the
form
of
which
will
readily
suggest
itself
in
accordance
with
your
particular
needs
or
desires
in
this
way
you
will
open
yourself
to
you
will
connect
yourself
with
and
you
will
set
into
operation
within
yourself
the
particular
order
of
forces
that
will
make
for
these
results
do
be
afraid
to
voice
your
desires
in
this
way
you
set
into
operation
vibratory
forces
which
go
out
and
which
make
their
impress
felt
somewhere
and
which
arousing
into
activity
or
uniting
with
other
forces
set
about
to
actualize
your
desires
no
good
thing
shall
be
withheld
from
him
who
lives
in
harmony
with
the
higher
laws
and
forces
there
are
no
desires
that
shall
not
be
satisfied
to
the
one
who
knows
and
who
wisely
uses
the
powers
with
which
he
or
she
is
endowed
your
sleep
will
be
more
quiet
and
peaceful
and
refreshing
and
so
your
power
increased
mentally
physically
and
spiritually
simply
by
sending
out
as
you
fall
asleep
thoughts
of
love
and
thoughts
of
peace
and
harmony
for
all
in
this
way
you
are
connecting
yourself
with
all
the
forces
in
the
universe
that
make
for
peace
and
harmony
a
friend
who
is
known
the
world
over
through
his
work
along
humane
lines
has
told
me
that
many
times
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
is
awakened
suddenly
and
there
comes
to
his
mind
as
a
flash
of
inspiration
a
certain
plan
in
connection
with
his
work
and
as
he
lays
there
quietly
and
opens
himself
to
it
the
methods
for
its
successful
carrying
out
all
reveal
themselves
to
him
clearly
in
this
way
many
plans
are
entered
upon
and
brought
to
a
successful
culmination
that
otherwise
would
never
be
thought
of
plans
that
seem
indeed
marvelous
to
the
world
at
large
he
is
a
man
with
a
sensitive
organism
his
life
in
thorough
harmony
with
the
higher
laws
and
given
wholly
and
unreservedly
to
the
work
to
which
he
has
dedicated
it
just
how
and
from
what
source
these
inspirations
come
he
does
not
fully
know
possibly
no
one
does
though
each
may
have
his
theory
but
this
we
do
know
and
it
is
all
we
need
to
know
now
at
least
that
to
the
one
who
lives
in
harmony
with
the
higher
laws
of
his
being
and
who
opens
himself
to
them
they
come
visions
and
inspirations
of
the
highest
order
will
come
in
the
degree
that
we
make
for
them
the
right
conditions
one
who
has
studied
deeply
into
the
subject
in
hand
has
said
to
receive
education
spiritually
while
the
body
is
resting
in
sleep
is
a
perfectly
normal
and
orderly
experience
and
would
occur
definitely
and
satisfactorily
in
the
lives
of
all
of
us
if
we
paid
more
attention
to
internal
and
consequently
less
to
external
states
with
their
supposed
but
unreal
necessities
our
thoughts
make
us
what
we
are
here
and
hereafter
and
our
thoughts
are
often
busier
by
night
than
by
day
for
when
we
are
asleep
to
the
exterior
we
can
be
wide
awake
to
the
interior
world
and
the
unseen
world
is
a
substantial
place
the
conditions
of
which
are
entirely
regulated
by
mental
and
moral
attainments
when
we
are
not
deriving
information
through
outward
avenues
of
sensation
we
are
receiving
instruction
through
interior
channels
of
perception
and
when
this
fact
is
understood
for
what
it
is
worth
it
will
become
a
universal
custom
for
persons
to
take
to
sleep
with
them
the
special
subject
on
which
they
most
earnestly
desire
particular
instruction
the
pharaoh
type
of
person
dreams
and
so
does
his
butler
and
baker
but
the
joseph
type
which
is
that
of
the
truly
gifted
seer
both
dreams
and
interprets
but
why
had
not
pharaoh
the
power
of
interpreting
his
dreams
why
was
joseph
the
type
of
the
truly
gifted
seer
why
did
he
not
only
dream
but
had
also
the
power
to
interpret
both
his
own
dreams
and
the
dreams
of
others
simply
read
the
lives
of
the
two
he
who
runs
may
read
in
all
true
power
it
is
after
all
living
the
life
that
tells
and
in
proportion
as
one
lives
the
life
does
he
not
only
attain
to
the
highest
power
and
joy
for
himself
but
he
also
becomes
of
ever
greater
service
to
all
the
world
one
need
remain
in
no
hell
longer
than
he
himself
chooses
to
and
the
moment
he
chooses
not
to
remain
longer
not
all
the
powers
in
the
universe
can
prevent
his
leaving
it
one
can
rise
to
any
heaven
he
himself
chooses
and
when
he
chooses
so
to
rise
all
the
higher
powers
of
the
universe
combine
to
help
him
heavenward
when
one
awakes
from
sleep
and
so
returns
to
conscious
life
he
is
in
a
peculiarly
receptive
and
impressionable
state
all
relations
with
the
material
world
have
for
a
time
been
shut
off
the
mind
is
in
a
freer
and
more
natural
state
resembling
somewhat
a
sensitive
plate
where
impressions
can
readily
leave
their
traces
this
is
why
many
times
the
highest
and
truest
impressions
come
to
one
in
the
early
morning
hours
before
the
activities
of
the
day
and
their
attendant
distractions
have
exerted
an
influence
this
is
one
reason
why
many
people
can
do
their
best
work
in
the
early
hours
of
the
day
but
this
fact
is
also
a
most
valuable
one
in
connection
with
the
moulding
of
life
the
mind
is
at
this
time
as
a
clean
sheet
of
paper
we
can
most
valuably
use
this
quiet
receptive
impressionable
period
by
wisely
directing
the
activities
of
the
mind
along
the
highest
and
most
desirable
paths
and
thus
so
to
speak
set
the
pace
for
the
day
each
morning
is
a
fresh
beginning
we
are
as
it
were
just
beginning
life
we
have
it
in
our
own
hands
and
when
the
morning
with
its
fresh
beginning
comes
all
yesterdays
should
be
yesterdays
with
which
we
have
nothing
to
do
sufficient
is
it
to
know
that
the
way
we
lived
our
yesterday
has
determined
for
us
our
today
and
again
when
the
morning
with
its
fresh
beginning
comes
all
tomorrows
should
be
tomorrows
with
which
we
have
nothing
to
do
sufficient
to
know
that
the
way
we
live
our
today
determines
our
tomorrow
every
day
is
a
fresh
beginning
every
morn
is
the
world
made
new
you
who
are
weary
of
sorrow
and
sinning
here
is
a
beautiful
hope
for
you
a
hope
for
me
and
a
hope
for
you
all
the
past
things
are
past
and
over
the
tasks
are
done
and
the
tears
are
shed
yesterday
errors
let
yesterday
cover
yesterday
wounds
which
smarted
and
bled
are
healed
with
the
healing
which
might
has
shed
let
them
go
since
we
can
not
relieve
them
can
not
undo
and
can
not
atone
god
in
his
mercy
receive
forgive
them
only
the
new
days
are
our
own
today
is
ours
and
today
alone
here
are
the
skies
all
burnished
brightly
here
is
the
spent
earth
all
reborn
here
are
the
tired
limbs
springing
lightly
to
face
the
sun
and
to
share
with
the
morn
in
the
chrism
of
dew
and
the
cool
of
dawn
every
day
is
a
fresh
beginning
listen
my
soul
to
the
glad
refrain
and
spite
of
old
sorrow
and
older
sinning
and
puzzles
forecasted
and
possible
pain
take
heart
with
the
day
and
begin
again
simply
the
first
hour
of
this
new
day
with
all
its
richness
and
glory
with
all
its
sublime
and
possibilities
and
each
succeeding
hour
as
it
comes
but
it
comes
this
is
the
secret
of
character
building
this
simple
method
will
bring
any
one
to
the
realization
of
the
highest
life
that
can
be
even
conceived
of
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
connection
that
can
be
conceived
of
that
can
not
be
realized
somehow
somewhen
somewhere
this
brings
such
a
life
within
the
possibilities
of
for
there
is
if
really
in
earnest
and
if
he
really
desires
it
who
can
not
live
to
his
highest
for
a
single
hour
but
even
though
there
should
be
if
he
is
earnest
in
his
then
through
the
law
that
like
builds
like
he
will
be
able
to
come
a
little
nearer
to
it
the
next
hour
and
still
nearer
the
next
and
the
next
until
sooner
or
later
comes
the
time
when
it
becomes
the
natural
and
any
other
would
require
the
effort
in
this
way
one
becomes
in
love
and
in
league
with
the
highest
and
best
in
the
universe
and
as
a
consequence
the
highest
and
best
in
the
universe
becomes
in
love
and
in
league
with
him
they
aid
him
at
every
turn
they
seem
literally
to
move
all
things
his
way
because
forsooth
he
has
first
moved
their
way
the
realization
of
perfect
peace
this
is
the
spirit
of
infinite
peace
and
the
moment
we
come
into
harmony
with
it
there
comes
to
us
an
inflowing
tide
of
peace
for
peace
is
harmony
a
deep
interior
meaning
underlies
the
great
truth
to
be
spiritually
minded
is
life
and
peace
to
recognize
the
fact
that
we
are
spirit
and
to
live
in
this
thought
is
to
be
spiritually
minded
and
so
to
be
in
harmony
and
peace
oh
the
thousands
of
men
and
women
all
about
us
weary
with
care
troubled
and
ill
at
ease
running
hither
and
thither
to
find
peace
weary
in
body
soul
and
mind
going
to
other
countries
traveling
the
world
over
coming
back
and
still
not
finding
it
of
course
they
have
not
found
it
and
they
never
will
find
it
in
this
way
because
they
are
looking
for
it
where
it
is
not
they
are
looking
for
it
without
when
they
should
look
within
peace
is
to
be
found
only
within
and
unless
one
find
it
there
he
will
never
find
it
at
all
peace
lies
not
in
the
external
world
it
lies
within
one
own
soul
we
may
travel
over
many
different
avenues
in
pursuit
of
it
we
may
seek
it
through
the
channels
of
the
bodily
appetites
and
passions
we
may
seek
it
through
all
the
channels
of
the
external
we
may
chase
for
it
hither
and
thither
but
it
will
always
be
just
beyond
our
grasp
because
we
are
searching
for
it
where
it
is
not
in
the
degree
however
that
we
order
the
bodily
appetites
and
passions
in
accordance
with
the
promptings
of
the
soul
within
will
the
higher
forms
of
happiness
and
peace
enter
our
lives
but
in
the
degree
that
we
fail
in
doing
this
will
disease
suffering
and
discontent
enter
in
to
be
at
one
with
god
is
to
be
at
peace
the
child
simplicity
is
the
greatest
agency
in
bringing
this
full
and
complete
realization
the
child
simplicity
that
recognizes
its
true
relations
with
the
life
there
are
people
i
know
who
have
come
into
such
a
conscious
realization
of
their
oneness
with
this
infinite
life
this
spirit
of
infinite
peace
that
their
lives
are
fairly
bubbling
over
with
joy
i
have
particularly
in
mind
at
this
moment
a
comparatively
young
man
who
was
an
invalid
for
several
years
his
health
completely
broken
with
nervous
exhaustion
who
thought
there
was
nothing
in
life
worth
living
for
to
whom
everything
and
everybody
presented
a
gloomy
aspect
and
he
in
turn
presented
a
gloomy
aspect
to
all
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
not
long
ago
he
came
into
such
a
vital
realization
of
his
oneness
with
this
infinite
power
he
opened
himself
so
completely
to
its
divine
inflow
that
today
he
is
in
perfect
health
and
frequently
as
i
meet
him
now
he
can
not
resist
the
impulse
to
cry
out
oh
it
is
a
joy
to
be
alive
i
know
an
officer
on
our
police
force
who
has
told
me
that
many
times
when
off
duty
and
on
his
way
home
in
the
evening
there
comes
to
him
such
a
vivid
and
vital
realization
of
his
oneness
with
this
infinite
power
and
this
spirit
of
infinite
peace
so
takes
hold
of
and
so
fills
him
that
it
seems
as
if
his
feet
could
scarcely
keep
to
the
pavement
so
buoyant
and
so
exhilarated
does
he
become
by
reason
of
this
inflowing
tide
he
who
comes
into
this
higher
realization
never
has
any
fear
for
he
has
always
with
him
a
sense
of
protection
and
the
very
realization
of
this
makes
his
protection
complete
of
him
it
is
true
no
weapon
that
is
formed
against
thee
shall
prosper
there
shall
no
ill
come
nigh
thy
dwelling
thou
shalt
be
in
league
with
the
stones
of
the
field
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
shall
be
at
peace
with
thee
these
are
the
men
and
the
women
who
seem
to
live
charmed
lives
the
moment
we
fear
anything
we
open
the
door
for
the
entrance
of
the
actualization
of
the
very
thing
we
fear
an
animal
will
never
harm
a
person
who
is
absolutely
fearless
in
regard
to
it
the
instant
he
fears
he
opens
himself
to
danger
and
some
animals
the
dog
for
example
can
instantly
detect
the
element
of
fear
and
this
gives
them
the
courage
to
do
harm
in
the
degree
that
we
come
into
a
full
realization
of
our
oneness
with
this
infinite
power
do
we
become
calm
and
quiet
undisturbed
by
the
little
occurrences
that
before
so
vex
and
annoy
us
we
are
no
longer
disappointed
in
people
for
we
always
read
them
aright
we
have
the
power
of
penetrating
into
their
very
souls
and
seeing
the
underlying
motives
that
are
at
work
there
a
gentleman
approached
a
friend
the
other
day
and
with
great
show
of
cordiality
grasped
him
by
the
hand
and
said
why
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
quick
as
a
flash
my
friend
read
him
and
looking
him
steadily
in
the
eye
replied
no
you
are
mistaken
you
are
not
glad
to
see
me
but
you
are
very
much
disconcerted
so
much
so
that
you
are
now
blushing
in
evidence
of
it
the
gentleman
replied
well
you
know
in
this
day
and
age
of
conventionality
and
form
we
have
to
put
on
the
show
and
sometimes
make
believe
what
we
do
not
really
feel
my
friend
once
more
looked
him
in
the
face
and
said
again
you
are
mistaken
let
me
give
you
one
little
word
of
advice
you
will
always
fare
better
and
will
think
far
more
of
yourself
always
to
recognize
and
to
tell
the
truth
rather
than
to
give
yourself
to
any
semblance
of
it
as
soon
as
we
are
able
to
read
people
aright
we
will
then
cease
to
be
disappointed
in
them
we
will
cease
to
place
them
on
pedestals
for
this
can
never
be
done
without
some
attendant
disappointment
the
fall
will
necessarily
come
sooner
or
later
and
moreover
we
are
thus
many
times
unfair
to
our
friends
when
we
come
into
harmony
with
this
spirit
of
peace
evil
reports
and
apparent
bad
treatment
either
at
the
hands
of
friends
or
of
enemies
will
no
longer
disturb
us
when
we
are
conscious
of
the
fact
that
in
our
life
and
our
work
we
are
true
to
that
eternal
principle
of
right
of
truth
of
justice
that
runs
through
all
the
universe
that
unites
and
governs
all
that
always
eventually
prevails
then
nothing
of
this
kind
can
come
nigh
us
and
come
what
may
we
will
always
be
tranquil
and
undisturbed
the
things
that
cause
sorrow
and
pain
and
bereavement
will
not
be
able
to
take
the
hold
of
us
they
now
take
for
true
wisdom
will
enable
us
to
see
the
proper
place
and
know
the
right
relations
of
all
things
the
loss
of
friends
by
the
transition
we
call
death
will
not
cause
sorrow
to
the
soul
that
has
come
into
this
higher
realization
for
he
knows
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
death
for
each
one
is
not
only
a
partaker
but
an
eternal
partaker
of
this
infinite
life
he
knows
that
the
mere
falling
away
of
the
physical
body
by
no
means
affects
the
real
soul
life
with
a
tranquil
spirit
born
of
a
higher
faith
he
can
realize
for
himself
and
to
those
less
strong
he
can
say
loving
friends
be
wise
and
dry
straightway
every
weeping
eye
what
you
left
upon
the
bier
is
not
worth
a
single
tear
is
a
simple
one
out
of
which
the
pearl
has
gone
the
shell
was
nothing
leave
it
there
the
pearl
the
soul
was
all
is
here
and
so
far
as
the
element
of
separation
is
concerned
he
realizes
that
to
spirit
there
are
no
bounds
and
that
spiritual
communion
whether
between
two
persons
in
the
body
or
two
persons
one
in
the
body
and
one
out
of
the
body
is
within
the
reach
of
all
in
the
degree
that
the
higher
spiritual
life
is
realized
can
there
be
this
higher
spiritual
communion
the
things
that
we
open
ourselves
to
always
come
to
us
people
in
the
olden
times
expected
to
see
angels
and
they
saw
them
but
there
is
no
more
reason
why
they
should
have
seen
them
than
that
we
should
see
them
now
no
more
reason
why
they
should
come
and
dwell
with
them
than
that
they
should
come
and
dwell
with
us
for
the
great
laws
governing
all
things
are
the
same
today
as
they
were
then
if
angels
come
not
to
minister
unto
us
it
is
because
we
do
not
invite
them
it
is
because
we
keep
the
door
closed
through
which
they
otherwise
might
enter
in
the
degree
that
we
are
filled
with
this
spirit
of
peace
by
thus
opening
ourselves
to
its
inflow
does
it
pour
through
us
so
that
we
carry
it
with
us
wherever
we
go
in
the
degree
that
we
thus
open
ourselves
do
we
become
magnets
to
attract
peace
from
all
sources
and
in
the
degree
that
we
attract
and
embody
it
in
ourselves
are
we
able
to
give
it
forth
to
others
we
can
in
this
way
become
such
perfect
embodiments
of
peace
that
wherever
we
go
we
are
continually
shedding
benedictions
but
a
day
or
two
ago
i
saw
a
woman
grasp
the
hand
of
a
man
his
face
showed
the
indwelling
god
saying
oh
it
does
me
so
much
good
to
see
you
i
have
been
in
anxiety
and
almost
in
despair
during
the
past
few
hours
but
the
very
sight
of
you
has
rolled
the
burden
entirely
away
there
are
people
all
around
us
who
are
continually
giving
out
blessings
and
comfort
persons
whose
mere
presence
seems
to
change
sorrow
into
joy
fear
into
courage
despair
into
hope
weakness
into
power
it
is
the
one
who
has
come
into
the
realization
of
his
own
true
self
who
carries
this
power
with
him
and
who
radiates
it
wherever
he
goes
the
one
who
as
we
say
has
found
his
centre
and
in
all
the
great
universe
there
is
but
one
centre
the
infinite
power
that
is
working
in
and
through
all
the
one
who
then
has
found
his
centre
is
the
one
who
has
come
into
the
realization
of
his
oneness
with
this
infinite
power
the
one
who
recognizes
himself
as
a
spiritual
being
for
god
is
spirit
such
is
the
man
of
power
centred
in
the
infinite
he
has
thereby
so
to
speak
connected
himself
with
he
has
attached
his
belts
to
the
great
of
the
universe
he
is
constantly
drawing
power
to
himself
from
all
sources
for
thus
centred
knowing
himself
conscious
of
his
own
power
the
thoughts
that
go
from
his
mind
are
thoughts
of
strength
and
by
virtue
of
the
law
that
like
attracts
like
he
by
his
thoughts
is
continually
attracting
to
himself
from
all
quarters
the
aid
of
all
whose
thoughts
are
thoughts
of
strength
and
in
this
way
he
is
linking
himself
with
this
order
of
thought
in
the
universe
and
so
to
him
that
hath
to
him
shall
be
given
this
is
simply
the
working
of
a
natural
law
his
strong
positive
and
hence
constructive
thought
is
continually
working
success
for
him
along
all
lines
and
continually
bringing
to
him
help
from
all
directions
the
things
that
he
sees
that
he
creates
in
the
ideal
are
through
the
agency
of
this
strong
constructive
thought
continually
clothing
themselves
taking
form
manifesting
themselves
in
the
material
silent
unseen
forces
are
at
work
which
will
sooner
or
later
be
made
manifest
in
the
visible
fear
and
all
thoughts
of
failure
never
suggest
themselves
to
such
a
man
or
if
they
do
they
are
immediately
sent
out
of
his
mind
and
so
he
is
not
influenced
by
this
order
of
thought
from
without
he
does
not
attract
it
to
him
he
is
in
another
current
of
thought
consequently
the
weakening
thoughts
of
the
fearing
the
vacillating
the
pessimistic
about
him
have
no
influence
upon
him
the
one
who
is
of
the
negative
fearing
kind
not
only
has
his
energies
and
his
physical
agents
weakened
or
even
paralyzed
through
the
influence
of
this
kind
of
thought
that
is
born
within
him
but
he
also
in
this
way
connects
himself
with
this
order
of
thought
in
the
world
about
him
and
in
the
degree
that
he
does
this
does
he
become
a
victim
to
the
weak
fearing
negative
minds
all
around
him
instead
of
growing
in
power
he
increases
in
weakness
he
is
in
the
same
order
of
thought
with
those
of
whom
it
is
true
and
even
that
which
they
have
shall
be
taken
away
from
them
this
again
is
simply
the
working
of
a
natural
law
the
same
as
is
its
opposite
fearing
lest
i
lose
even
what
i
have
i
hide
it
away
in
a
napkin
very
well
i
must
then
pay
the
price
of
my
fearing
lest
i
lose
thoughts
of
strength
both
build
strength
from
within
and
attract
it
from
without
thoughts
of
weakness
actualize
weakness
from
within
and
attract
it
from
without
courage
begets
strength
fear
begets
weakness
and
so
courage
begets
success
fear
begets
failure
it
is
the
man
or
the
woman
of
faith
and
hence
of
courage
who
is
the
master
of
circumstances
and
who
makes
his
or
her
power
felt
in
the
world
it
is
the
man
or
the
woman
who
lacks
faith
and
who
as
a
consequence
is
weakened
and
crippled
by
fears
and
forebodings
who
is
the
creature
of
all
passing
occurrences
within
each
one
lies
the
cause
of
whatever
comes
to
him
each
has
it
in
his
own
hands
to
determine
what
comes
everything
in
the
visible
material
world
has
its
origin
in
the
unseen
the
spiritual
the
thought
world
this
is
the
world
of
cause
the
former
is
the
world
of
effect
the
nature
of
the
effect
is
always
in
accordance
with
the
nature
of
the
cause
what
one
lives
in
his
invisible
thought
world
he
is
continually
actualizing
in
his
visible
material
world
if
he
would
have
any
conditions
different
in
the
latter
he
must
make
the
necessary
change
in
the
former
a
clear
realization
of
this
great
fact
would
bring
success
to
thousands
of
men
and
women
who
all
about
us
are
now
in
the
depths
of
despair
it
would
bring
health
abounding
health
and
strength
to
thousands
now
diseased
and
suffering
it
would
bring
peace
and
joy
to
thousands
now
unhappy
and
ill
at
ease
and
oh
the
thousands
all
about
us
who
are
continually
living
in
the
slavery
of
fear
the
spirits
within
that
should
be
strong
and
powerful
are
rendered
weak
and
impotent
their
energies
are
crippled
their
efforts
are
paralyzed
fear
is
everywhere
fear
of
want
fear
of
starvation
fear
of
public
opinion
fear
of
private
opinion
fear
that
what
we
own
today
may
not
be
ours
tomorrow
fear
of
sickness
fear
of
death
fear
has
become
with
millions
a
fixed
habit
the
thought
is
everywhere
the
thought
is
thrown
upon
us
from
every
direction
to
live
in
continual
dread
continual
cringing
continual
fear
of
anything
be
it
loss
of
love
loss
of
money
loss
of
position
or
situation
is
to
take
the
readiest
means
to
lose
what
we
fear
we
shall
by
fear
nothing
is
to
be
gained
but
on
the
contrary
everything
is
to
be
lost
i
know
this
is
true
says
one
but
i
am
given
to
fear
it
natural
to
me
and
i
ca
help
it
ca
help
it
in
saying
this
you
indicate
one
great
reason
of
your
fear
by
showing
that
you
do
not
even
know
yourself
as
yet
you
must
know
yourself
in
order
to
know
your
powers
and
not
until
you
know
them
can
you
use
them
wisely
and
fully
do
say
you
ca
help
it
if
you
think
you
ca
the
chances
are
that
you
ca
if
you
think
you
can
and
act
in
accordance
with
this
thought
then
not
only
are
the
chances
that
you
can
but
if
you
act
fully
in
accordance
with
it
that
you
can
and
that
you
will
is
an
absolute
certainty
it
was
virgil
who
in
describing
the
crew
which
in
his
mind
would
win
the
race
said
of
them
they
can
because
they
think
they
can
in
other
words
this
very
attitude
of
mind
on
their
part
will
infuse
a
spiritual
power
into
their
bodies
that
will
give
them
the
strength
and
endurance
which
will
enable
them
to
win
then
take
the
thought
that
you
take
it
merely
as
a
if
need
be
plant
it
in
your
consciousness
tend
it
cultivate
it
and
it
will
gradually
reach
out
and
gather
strength
from
all
quarters
it
will
focus
and
make
positive
and
active
the
spiritual
force
within
you
that
is
now
scattered
and
of
little
avail
it
will
draw
to
itself
force
from
without
it
will
draw
to
your
aid
the
influence
of
other
minds
of
its
own
nature
minds
that
are
fearless
strong
courageous
you
will
thus
draw
to
yourself
and
connect
yourself
with
this
order
of
thought
if
earnest
and
faithful
the
time
will
soon
come
when
all
fear
will
loose
its
hold
and
instead
of
being
an
embodiment
of
weakness
and
a
creature
of
circumstances
you
will
find
yourself
a
tower
of
strength
and
a
master
of
circumstances
we
need
more
faith
in
life
faith
in
the
power
that
works
for
good
faith
in
the
infinite
god
and
hence
faith
in
ourselves
created
in
his
image
and
however
things
at
times
may
seem
to
go
however
dark
at
times
appearances
may
be
the
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
the
supreme
power
has
us
in
its
charge
as
it
has
the
suns
and
endless
systems
of
worlds
in
space
will
give
us
the
supreme
faith
that
all
is
well
with
us
the
same
as
all
is
well
with
the
world
thou
wilt
keep
him
in
perfect
peace
whose
mind
is
stayed
on
thee
there
is
nothing
firmer
and
safer
and
surer
than
deity
then
as
we
recognize
the
fact
that
we
have
it
in
our
own
hands
to
open
ourselves
ever
more
fully
to
this
infinite
power
and
call
upon
it
to
manifest
itself
in
and
through
us
we
will
find
in
ourselves
an
ever
increasing
sense
of
power
for
in
this
way
we
are
working
in
conjunction
with
it
and
it
in
turn
is
working
in
conjunction
with
us
we
are
then
led
into
the
full
realization
of
the
fact
that
all
things
work
together
for
good
to
those
that
love
the
good
then
the
fears
and
forebodings
that
have
dominated
us
in
the
past
will
be
transmuted
into
faith
and
faith
when
rightly
understood
and
rightly
used
is
a
force
before
which
nothing
can
stand
materialism
leads
naturally
to
pessimism
and
how
could
it
do
otherwise
a
knowledge
of
the
spiritual
power
working
in
and
through
us
as
well
as
in
and
through
all
things
a
power
that
works
for
righteousness
leads
to
optimism
pessimism
leads
to
weakness
optimism
leads
to
power
the
one
who
is
centred
in
deity
is
the
one
who
not
only
outrides
every
storm
but
who
through
the
faith
and
so
the
conscious
power
that
is
in
him
faces
storm
with
the
same
calmness
and
serenity
that
he
faces
fair
weather
for
he
knows
well
beforehand
what
the
outcome
will
be
he
knows
that
underneath
are
the
everlasting
arms
he
it
is
who
realizes
the
truth
of
the
injunction
rest
in
the
lord
wait
patiently
for
him
and
he
shall
give
thee
thy
desire
all
shall
be
given
simply
given
to
him
who
is
ready
to
accept
it
can
anything
be
clearer
than
this
in
the
degree
then
that
we
work
in
conjunction
with
the
supreme
power
do
we
need
the
less
to
concern
ourselves
about
results
to
live
in
the
full
realization
of
this
fact
and
all
that
attends
it
brings
peace
a
full
rich
abiding
peace
a
peace
that
makes
the
present
complete
and
that
going
on
before
brings
back
the
assurance
that
as
our
days
so
shall
our
strength
be
the
one
who
is
thus
centred
even
in
the
face
of
all
the
unrest
and
the
turmoil
about
us
can
realize
and
say
i
stay
my
haste
i
make
delays
for
what
avails
this
eager
pace
i
stand
amid
eternal
ways
and
what
is
mine
shall
know
my
face
asleep
awake
by
night
or
day
the
friends
i
seek
are
seeking
me
no
wind
can
drive
my
bark
astray
nor
change
the
tide
of
destiny
the
waters
know
their
own
and
draw
the
brooks
that
spring
in
yonder
height
so
flows
the
good
with
equal
law
unto
the
soul
of
pure
delight
the
stars
come
nightly
to
the
sky
the
tidal
wave
unto
the
sea
nor
time
nor
space
nor
deep
nor
high
can
keep
my
own
away
from
me
coming
into
fullness
of
power
this
is
the
spirit
of
infinite
power
and
in
the
degree
that
we
open
ourselves
to
it
does
power
become
manifest
in
us
with
god
all
things
are
possible
that
is
in
conjunction
with
god
all
things
are
possible
the
true
secret
of
power
lies
in
keeping
one
connection
with
the
god
who
worketh
all
things
and
in
the
degree
that
we
keep
this
connection
are
we
able
literally
to
rise
above
every
conceivable
limitation
why
then
waste
time
in
running
hither
and
thither
to
acquire
power
why
waste
time
with
this
practice
or
that
practice
why
not
go
directly
to
the
mountain
top
itself
instead
of
wandering
through
the
in
the
valleys
and
on
the
mountain
sides
that
man
has
absolute
dominion
as
taught
in
all
the
scriptures
of
the
world
is
true
not
of
physical
man
but
of
there
are
many
animals
for
example
larger
and
stronger
over
which
from
a
physical
standpoint
he
would
not
have
dominion
but
he
can
gain
supremacy
over
even
these
by
calling
into
activity
the
higher
mental
psychic
and
spiritual
forces
with
which
he
is
endowed
whatever
ca
be
done
in
the
physical
can
be
done
in
the
spiritual
and
in
direct
proportion
as
a
man
recognizes
himself
as
spirit
and
lives
accordingly
is
he
able
to
transcend
in
power
the
man
who
recognizes
himself
merely
as
material
all
the
sacred
literature
of
the
world
is
teeming
with
examples
of
what
we
call
miracles
they
are
not
confined
to
any
particular
times
or
places
there
is
no
age
of
miracles
in
distinction
from
any
other
period
that
may
be
an
age
of
miracles
whatever
has
been
done
in
the
world
history
can
be
done
again
through
the
operation
of
the
same
laws
and
forces
these
miracles
were
performed
not
by
those
who
were
more
than
men
but
by
those
who
through
the
recognition
of
their
oneness
with
god
became
so
that
the
higher
forces
and
powers
worked
through
them
for
what
let
us
ask
is
a
miracle
is
it
something
supernatural
supernatural
only
in
the
sense
of
being
above
the
natural
or
rather
above
that
which
is
natural
to
man
in
his
ordinary
state
a
miracle
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
this
one
who
has
come
into
a
knowledge
of
his
true
identity
of
his
oneness
with
the
wisdom
and
power
thus
makes
it
possible
for
laws
higher
than
the
ordinary
mind
knows
of
to
be
revealed
to
him
these
laws
he
makes
use
of
the
people
see
the
results
and
by
virtue
of
their
own
limitations
call
them
miracles
and
speak
of
the
person
who
performs
these
apparently
supernatural
works
as
a
supernatural
being
but
they
as
supernatural
beings
could
themselves
perform
these
supernatural
works
if
they
would
open
themselves
to
the
recognition
of
the
same
laws
and
consequently
to
the
realization
of
the
same
possibilities
and
powers
and
let
us
also
remember
that
the
supernatural
of
yesterday
becomes
as
in
the
process
of
evolution
we
advance
from
the
lower
to
the
higher
from
the
more
material
to
the
more
spiritual
the
common
and
the
natural
of
today
and
what
seems
to
be
the
supernatural
of
today
becomes
in
the
same
way
the
natural
of
tomorrow
and
so
on
through
the
ages
yes
it
is
the
who
does
the
things
that
appear
supernatural
the
man
who
by
virtue
of
his
realization
of
the
higher
powers
transcends
the
majority
and
so
stands
out
among
them
but
any
power
that
is
possible
to
one
human
soul
is
possible
to
another
the
same
laws
operate
in
every
life
we
can
be
men
and
women
of
power
or
we
can
be
men
and
women
of
impotence
the
moment
one
vitally
grasps
the
fact
that
he
can
rise
he
will
rise
and
he
can
have
absolutely
no
limitations
other
than
the
limitations
he
sets
to
himself
cream
always
rises
to
the
top
it
rises
simply
because
is
the
nature
of
cream
to
we
hear
much
said
of
environment
we
need
to
realize
that
environment
should
never
be
allowed
to
make
the
man
but
that
man
should
always
always
condition
the
environment
when
we
realize
this
we
will
find
that
many
times
it
is
not
necessary
to
take
ourselves
out
of
any
particular
environment
because
we
may
yet
have
a
work
to
do
there
but
by
the
very
force
we
carry
with
us
we
can
so
affect
and
change
matters
that
we
will
have
an
entirely
new
set
of
conditions
in
an
old
environment
the
same
is
true
in
regard
to
hereditary
traits
and
influences
we
sometimes
hear
the
question
asked
can
they
be
overcome
only
the
one
who
does
yet
know
himself
can
ask
a
question
such
as
this
if
we
entertain
and
live
in
the
belief
that
they
can
not
be
overcome
then
the
chances
are
that
they
will
always
remain
the
moment
however
that
we
come
into
a
realization
of
our
true
selves
and
so
of
the
tremendous
powers
and
forces
within
the
powers
and
forces
of
the
mind
and
spirit
hereditary
traits
and
influences
that
are
harmful
in
nature
will
begin
to
lessen
and
will
disappear
with
a
rapidity
directly
in
proportion
to
the
completeness
of
this
realization
there
is
no
thing
we
can
not
overcome
say
not
thy
evil
instinct
is
inherited
or
that
some
trait
inborn
makes
thy
whole
life
forlorn
and
calls
down
punishment
that
is
not
merited
back
of
thy
parents
and
grandparents
lies
the
great
eternal
will
that
too
is
thine
inheritance
strong
beautiful
divine
sure
lever
of
success
for
one
who
tries
there
is
no
noble
height
thou
canst
not
climb
all
triumphs
may
be
thine
in
time
futurity
if
thy
fault
thou
dost
not
faint
or
halt
but
lean
upon
the
staff
of
god
security
earth
has
no
claim
the
soul
can
not
contest
know
thyself
part
of
the
eternal
source
naught
can
stand
before
thy
spirit
force
the
soul
divine
inheritance
is
best
again
there
are
many
who
are
living
far
below
their
possibilities
because
they
are
continually
handing
over
their
individualities
to
others
do
you
want
to
be
a
power
in
the
world
then
be
yourself
do
class
yourself
do
allow
yourself
to
be
classed
among
the
among
the
people
be
true
to
the
highest
within
your
own
soul
and
then
allow
yourself
to
be
governed
by
no
customs
or
conventionalities
or
arbitrary
rules
that
are
not
founded
upon
those
things
that
are
founded
upon
principle
will
be
observed
by
the
the
man
or
woman
in
any
case
do
surrender
your
individuality
which
is
your
greatest
agent
of
power
to
the
customs
and
conventionalities
that
have
gotten
their
life
from
the
great
mass
of
those
who
have
enough
force
to
preserve
their
individualities
those
who
in
other
words
have
given
them
over
as
ingredients
to
the
mush
of
concession
which
one
of
our
greatest
writers
has
said
characterizes
our
modern
society
if
you
do
surrender
your
individuality
in
this
way
you
simply
aid
in
increasing
the
undesirable
conditions
in
payment
for
this
you
become
a
slave
and
the
chances
are
that
in
time
you
will
be
unable
to
hold
even
the
respect
of
those
whom
you
in
this
way
try
to
please
if
you
preserve
your
individuality
then
you
become
a
master
and
if
wise
and
discreet
your
influence
and
power
will
be
an
aid
in
bringing
about
a
higher
a
better
and
a
more
healthy
set
of
conditions
in
the
world
all
people
moreover
will
think
more
of
you
will
honor
you
more
highly
for
doing
this
than
if
you
show
your
weakness
by
contributing
yourself
to
the
same
mush
of
concession
that
so
many
of
them
are
contributing
themselves
to
with
all
classes
of
people
you
will
then
have
an
influence
a
great
style
of
hero
draws
equally
all
classes
all
extremes
of
society
to
him
till
we
say
the
very
dogs
believe
in
him
to
be
one
self
is
the
only
worthy
and
by
all
means
the
only
satisfactory
thing
to
be
may
it
not
be
good
policy
says
one
to
be
governed
sometimes
by
one
surroundings
what
is
good
policy
to
be
yourself
first
last
and
always
this
above
all
to
thine
own
self
be
true
and
it
must
follow
as
the
night
the
day
thou
canst
not
then
be
false
to
any
man
when
we
appeal
to
the
supreme
and
our
life
is
governed
by
a
principle
we
are
not
governed
either
by
fear
of
public
opinion
or
loss
of
approbation
and
we
may
be
sure
that
the
supreme
will
sustain
us
if
in
any
way
we
try
to
live
to
suit
others
we
never
shall
suit
them
and
the
more
we
try
the
more
unreasonable
and
exacting
do
they
become
the
government
of
your
life
is
a
matter
that
lies
entirely
between
god
and
yourself
and
when
your
life
is
swayed
and
influenced
from
any
other
source
you
are
on
the
wrong
path
when
we
find
the
kingdom
within
and
become
centred
in
the
infinite
then
we
become
a
law
unto
ourselves
when
we
become
a
law
unto
ourselves
then
we
are
able
to
bring
others
to
a
knowledge
of
laws
higher
than
they
are
governed
or
many
times
even
enslaved
by
when
we
have
found
this
centre
then
that
beautiful
simplicity
at
once
the
charm
and
the
power
of
a
truly
great
personality
enters
into
our
lives
then
all
striving
for
effect
that
sure
indicator
of
weakness
and
a
lack
of
genuine
power
is
absent
this
striving
for
effect
that
is
so
common
is
always
an
indicator
of
a
lack
of
something
it
brings
to
mind
the
man
who
rides
behind
a
horse
conscious
of
the
fact
that
there
is
not
enough
in
to
attract
attention
in
common
with
a
number
of
other
weaklings
he
adopts
the
brutal
method
of
having
his
horse
tail
sawed
off
that
its
unnatural
odd
appearance
may
attract
from
people
the
attention
that
he
of
himself
is
unable
to
secure
but
the
one
who
strives
for
effect
is
always
fooled
more
than
he
succeeds
in
fooling
others
the
man
and
the
woman
of
true
wisdom
and
insight
can
always
see
the
causes
that
prompt
the
motives
that
underlie
the
acts
of
all
with
whom
he
or
she
comes
in
contact
he
is
great
who
is
what
he
is
from
nature
and
who
never
reminds
us
of
others
the
men
and
the
women
who
are
truly
awake
to
the
real
powers
within
are
the
men
and
women
who
seem
to
be
doing
so
little
yet
who
in
reality
are
doing
so
much
they
seem
to
be
doing
so
little
because
they
are
working
with
higher
agencies
and
yet
are
doing
so
much
because
of
this
very
fact
they
do
their
work
on
the
higher
plane
they
keep
so
completely
their
connection
with
the
infinite
power
that
does
the
work
for
them
and
they
are
relieved
of
the
responsibility
they
are
the
people
they
are
because
it
is
the
infinite
power
that
is
working
through
them
and
with
this
infinite
power
they
are
simply
secret
of
the
highest
power
is
simply
the
uniting
of
the
outer
agencies
of
expression
with
the
power
that
works
from
are
you
a
painter
then
in
the
degree
that
you
open
yourself
to
the
power
of
the
forces
within
will
you
become
great
instead
of
mediocre
you
can
never
put
into
permanent
form
inspirations
higher
than
those
that
come
through
your
own
soul
in
order
for
the
higher
inspirations
to
come
through
it
you
must
open
your
soul
you
must
open
it
fully
to
the
supreme
source
of
all
inspiration
are
you
an
orator
in
the
degree
that
you
come
into
harmony
and
work
in
conjunction
with
the
higher
powers
that
will
speak
through
you
will
you
have
the
real
power
of
moulding
and
of
moving
men
if
you
use
merely
your
physical
agents
you
will
be
simply
a
demagogue
if
you
open
yourself
so
that
the
voice
of
god
can
speak
through
and
use
your
physical
agents
you
will
become
a
great
and
true
orator
great
and
true
in
just
the
degree
that
you
so
open
yourself
are
you
a
singer
then
open
yourself
and
let
the
god
within
pour
forth
in
the
spirit
of
song
you
will
find
it
a
thousand
times
easier
than
all
your
long
and
studied
practice
without
this
and
other
things
being
equal
there
will
come
to
you
a
power
of
song
so
enchanting
and
so
enrapturing
that
its
influence
upon
all
who
hear
will
be
irresistible
when
my
cabin
or
tent
has
been
pitched
during
the
summer
on
the
edge
or
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
i
have
sometimes
lain
awake
on
my
cot
in
the
early
morning
just
as
the
day
was
beginning
to
break
silence
at
first
then
an
intermittent
chirp
here
and
there
and
as
the
unfolding
tints
of
the
dawn
became
faintly
perceptible
these
grew
more
and
more
frequent
until
by
and
by
the
whole
forest
seemed
to
burst
forth
in
one
grand
chorus
of
song
wonderful
wonderful
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
trees
as
if
every
as
if
the
bushes
the
very
sky
above
and
the
earth
beneath
had
part
in
this
wonderful
symphony
then
as
i
have
listened
as
it
went
on
and
on
i
have
thought
what
a
study
in
the
matter
of
song
if
we
could
but
learn
from
the
birds
if
we
could
but
open
ourselves
to
the
same
powers
and
allow
them
to
pour
forth
in
us
what
singers
what
movers
of
men
we
might
have
nay
what
singers
and
what
movers
of
men
would
do
you
know
the
circumstances
under
which
sankey
sang
for
the
first
time
the
ninety
and
nine
says
one
of
our
able
journals
at
a
great
meeting
recently
in
denver
ira
sankey
before
singing
ninety
and
nine
which
perhaps
of
all
his
compositions
is
the
one
that
has
brought
him
the
most
fame
gave
an
account
of
its
birth
leaving
glasgow
for
edinburg
with
moody
he
stopped
at
a
and
bought
a
penny
religious
paper
glancing
over
it
as
they
rode
on
the
cars
his
eye
fell
on
a
few
little
verses
in
the
corner
of
the
page
turning
to
moody
he
said
found
my
hymn
but
moody
was
busily
engaged
and
did
not
hear
a
word
sankey
did
not
find
time
to
make
a
tune
for
the
verses
so
he
pasted
them
in
his
music
scrapbook
one
day
they
had
an
unusually
impressive
meeting
in
edinburg
in
which
bonar
had
spoken
with
great
effect
on
good
shepherd
at
the
close
of
the
address
moody
beckoned
to
his
partner
to
sing
he
thought
of
nothing
but
the
psalm
but
that
he
had
sung
so
often
his
second
thought
was
to
sing
the
verses
he
had
found
in
the
newspaper
but
the
third
thought
was
how
could
it
be
done
when
he
had
no
tune
then
a
fourth
thought
came
and
that
was
to
sing
them
anyway
he
put
the
verses
before
him
touched
the
keys
of
the
organ
opened
his
mouth
and
sang
not
knowing
where
he
was
going
to
come
out
he
finished
the
first
verse
amid
profound
silence
he
took
a
long
breath
and
wondered
if
he
could
sing
the
second
the
same
way
he
tried
and
succeeded
after
that
it
was
easy
to
sing
it
when
he
finished
the
hymn
the
meeting
was
all
broken
down
and
the
throngs
were
crying
sankey
says
it
was
the
most
intense
moment
of
his
life
moody
said
he
never
heard
a
song
like
it
it
was
sung
at
every
meeting
and
was
soon
going
over
the
world
when
we
open
ourselves
to
the
highest
inspirations
they
never
fail
us
when
we
fail
to
do
this
we
fail
in
attaining
the
highest
results
whatever
the
undertaking
are
you
a
writer
then
remember
that
the
one
great
precept
underlying
all
successful
literary
work
is
into
thine
own
heart
and
write
be
true
be
fearless
be
loyal
to
the
promptings
of
your
own
remember
that
an
author
can
never
write
more
than
he
himself
is
if
he
would
write
more
then
he
must
be
more
he
is
simply
his
own
amanuensis
he
in
a
sense
writes
himself
into
his
book
he
can
put
no
more
into
it
than
he
himself
is
if
he
is
one
of
a
great
personality
strong
in
purpose
deep
in
feeling
open
always
to
the
highest
inspirations
a
certain
indefinable
something
gets
into
his
pages
that
makes
them
breathe
forth
a
vital
living
power
a
power
so
great
that
each
reader
gets
the
same
inspirations
as
those
that
spoke
through
the
author
that
written
between
the
lines
is
many
times
more
than
that
that
written
in
the
lines
it
is
the
spirit
of
the
author
that
engenders
this
power
it
is
this
that
gives
that
extra
or
thirty
per
cent
that
takes
a
book
out
of
the
class
called
medium
and
lifts
it
into
the
class
called
superior
that
extra
per
cent
that
makes
it
the
one
of
the
hundred
that
is
truly
successful
while
the
never
see
more
than
their
first
edition
it
is
this
same
spiritual
power
that
the
author
of
a
great
personality
puts
into
his
work
that
causes
it
to
go
so
rapidly
from
reader
to
reader
for
the
only
way
that
any
book
circulates
in
the
ultimate
is
from
mouth
to
mouth
any
book
that
reaches
a
large
circulation
it
is
this
that
many
times
causes
a
single
reader
in
view
of
its
value
to
himself
to
purchase
numbers
of
copies
for
others
a
good
poem
says
emerson
goes
about
the
world
offering
itself
to
reasonable
men
who
read
it
with
joy
and
carry
it
to
their
reasonable
neighbors
thus
it
draws
to
it
the
and
generous
confirming
their
secret
thoughts
and
through
their
sympathy
publishing
this
is
the
type
of
author
who
writes
not
with
the
thought
of
having
what
he
writes
become
literature
but
he
writes
with
the
sole
thought
of
reaching
the
hearts
of
the
people
giving
them
something
of
vital
value
something
that
will
broaden
sweeten
enrich
and
beautify
their
lives
that
will
lead
them
to
the
finding
of
the
higher
life
and
with
it
the
higher
powers
and
the
higher
joys
it
most
always
happens
however
that
if
he
succeeds
in
thus
reaching
the
people
the
becoming
literature
part
somehow
takes
care
of
itself
and
far
better
than
if
he
aimed
for
it
directly
the
one
on
the
other
hand
who
fears
to
depart
from
beaten
paths
who
allows
himself
to
be
bound
by
arbitrary
rules
limits
his
own
creative
powers
in
just
the
degree
that
he
allows
himself
so
to
be
bound
my
book
says
one
of
the
greatest
of
modern
authors
shall
smell
of
the
pines
and
resound
with
the
hum
of
insects
the
swallow
over
my
window
shall
interweave
that
thread
or
straw
he
carries
in
his
bill
into
my
web
also
far
better
gentle
sage
to
have
it
smell
of
the
pines
and
resound
with
the
hum
of
insects
than
to
have
it
sound
of
the
rules
that
a
smaller
type
of
man
gets
by
studying
the
works
of
a
few
great
fearless
writers
like
yourself
and
formulating
from
what
he
thus
gains
a
handbook
of
rhetoric
of
no
use
are
the
men
who
study
to
do
exactly
as
was
done
before
who
can
never
understand
that
is
a
new
when
shakspeare
is
charged
with
debts
to
his
authors
landor
replies
yet
he
was
more
original
than
his
originals
he
breathed
upon
dead
bodies
and
brought
them
into
life
this
is
the
type
of
man
who
does
move
the
world
way
but
who
moves
the
world
his
way
i
had
rather
be
an
amanuensis
of
the
infinite
god
as
it
is
my
privilege
literally
to
be
than
a
slave
to
the
formulated
rules
of
any
rhetorician
or
to
the
opinions
of
any
critic
oh
the
people
the
people
over
and
over
let
me
give
something
to
them
that
will
lighten
the
struggles
of
our
common
life
something
that
will
add
a
little
sweetness
here
a
little
hope
there
something
that
will
make
more
thoughtful
kind
and
gentle
this
thoughtless
man
something
that
will
awaken
into
activity
the
dormant
powers
of
this
timid
shrinking
little
woman
powers
that
when
awakened
will
be
irresistible
in
their
influence
and
that
will
surprise
even
herself
let
me
give
something
that
will
lead
each
one
to
the
knowledge
of
the
divinity
of
every
human
soul
something
that
will
lead
each
one
to
the
conscious
realization
of
own
with
all
its
attendant
riches
and
glories
and
powers
let
me
succeed
in
doing
this
and
i
can
then
well
afford
to
be
careless
as
to
whether
the
critics
praise
or
whether
they
blame
if
it
is
blame
then
under
these
circumstances
it
is
as
the
cracking
of
a
few
dead
sticks
on
the
ground
below
compared
to
the
matchless
music
that
the
soft
spring
gale
is
breathing
through
the
great
pine
forest
are
you
a
minister
or
a
religious
teacher
of
any
kind
then
in
the
degree
that
you
free
yourself
from
the
theological
dogmas
that
have
held
and
that
are
holding
and
limiting
so
many
and
in
the
degree
that
you
open
yourself
to
the
divine
breath
will
you
be
one
who
will
speak
with
authority
in
the
degree
that
you
do
this
will
you
study
the
prophets
less
and
be
in
the
way
of
becoming
a
prophet
yourself
the
way
is
open
for
you
exactly
the
same
as
it
has
ever
been
open
for
anyone
if
when
born
into
the
world
you
came
into
a
family
of
the
race
then
in
all
probability
you
are
a
christian
to
be
a
christian
is
to
be
a
follower
of
the
of
jesus
the
christ
to
live
in
harmony
with
the
same
laws
he
lived
in
harmony
with
in
brief
live
his
the
great
central
fact
of
his
teaching
was
this
conscious
union
of
man
with
the
father
it
was
the
complete
realization
of
this
oneness
with
the
father
on
his
part
that
made
jesus
the
christ
it
was
through
this
that
he
attained
to
the
power
he
attained
to
that
he
spake
as
never
man
spake
he
never
claimed
for
himself
anything
that
he
did
not
claim
equally
for
all
mankind
the
mighty
works
performed
by
jesus
were
not
exceptional
they
were
the
natural
and
necessary
concomitants
of
his
state
he
declared
them
to
be
in
accordance
with
unvarying
order
he
spoke
of
them
as
no
unique
performances
but
as
the
outcome
of
a
state
to
which
all
might
attain
if
they
chose
as
a
teacher
and
demonstrator
of
truth
according
to
his
own
confession
he
did
nothing
for
the
purpose
of
proving
his
solitary
divinity
the
life
and
triumph
of
jesus
formed
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
race
his
coming
and
victory
marked
a
new
era
in
human
affairs
he
introduced
a
new
because
a
more
complete
ideal
to
the
earth
and
when
his
three
most
intimate
companions
saw
in
some
measure
what
the
new
life
really
signified
they
fell
to
the
earth
speechless
with
awe
and
admiration
by
coming
into
this
complete
realization
of
his
oneness
with
the
father
by
mastering
absolutely
mastering
every
circumstance
that
crossed
his
path
through
life
even
to
the
death
of
the
body
and
by
pointing
out
to
us
the
great
laws
which
are
the
same
for
us
as
they
were
for
him
he
has
given
us
an
ideal
of
life
an
ideal
for
us
to
attain
to
and
that
we
could
not
have
without
him
has
conquered
first
all
may
conquer
by
completely
realizing
it
first
for
himself
and
then
by
pointing
out
to
others
this
great
law
of
the
with
the
father
he
has
become
probably
the
greatest
saviour
do
mistake
his
mere
person
for
his
life
and
his
teachings
an
error
that
has
been
made
in
connection
with
most
all
great
teachers
by
their
disciples
over
and
over
again
and
if
you
have
been
among
the
number
who
have
been
preaching
a
dead
christ
then
for
humanity
sake
for
christ
sake
for
god
sake
and
i
speak
most
reverently
do
steal
the
people
time
any
longer
do
waste
your
own
time
more
in
giving
them
stones
in
place
of
bread
dead
form
for
the
spirit
of
living
truth
in
his
own
words
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
come
out
from
among
them
teach
as
did
jesus
living
teach
as
did
jesus
christ
find
this
in
all
its
transcendent
beauty
and
power
find
it
as
jesus
found
it
then
you
also
will
be
one
who
will
speak
with
authority
then
you
will
be
able
to
lead
large
numbers
of
others
to
its
finding
this
is
the
pearl
of
great
price
it
is
the
type
of
preacher
whose
soul
has
never
as
yet
even
perceived
the
of
the
teachings
of
jesus
and
who
as
a
consequence
instead
of
giving
this
to
the
people
is
giving
them
old
forms
and
dogmas
and
speculations
who
is
emptying
our
churches
this
is
the
type
whose
chief
efforts
seem
to
be
in
getting
men
ready
to
die
the
germans
have
a
saying
never
go
to
the
second
thing
first
we
need
men
who
will
teach
us
first
how
to
live
living
quite
invariably
precedes
dying
this
also
is
true
that
when
we
once
know
how
to
live
and
live
in
accordance
with
what
we
know
then
the
dying
as
we
term
it
will
in
a
wonderfully
beautiful
manner
take
care
of
itself
it
is
in
fact
the
only
way
in
which
it
can
be
taken
care
of
it
is
on
account
of
this
emptying
of
our
churches
for
the
reason
that
the
people
are
tiring
of
mere
husks
that
many
people
are
frequently
heard
to
say
that
religion
is
dying
out
religion
dying
out
how
can
anything
die
before
it
is
really
born
and
so
far
as
the
people
are
concerned
religion
is
just
being
born
or
rather
they
are
just
awaking
to
a
vital
religion
we
are
just
beginning
to
get
beyond
the
mere
letter
into
its
real
vital
spirit
religion
dying
out
impossible
even
to
conceive
of
religion
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
human
soul
as
the
human
soul
is
a
part
of
god
and
as
long
as
god
and
the
human
soul
exist
religion
will
never
die
much
of
the
dogma
the
form
the
ceremony
the
mere
letter
that
has
stood
as
religion
and
honestly
many
times
let
us
be
fair
enough
to
say
this
thank
god
is
rapidly
dying
out
and
never
so
rapidly
as
it
is
today
by
two
methods
it
is
dying
there
is
first
a
large
class
of
people
tired
of
or
even
nauseated
with
it
all
who
conscientiously
prefer
to
have
nothing
rather
than
this
they
are
simply
abandoning
it
the
same
as
a
tree
abandons
its
leaves
when
the
early
winter
comes
there
is
second
a
large
class
in
whom
the
divine
breath
is
stirring
who
are
finding
the
christ
within
in
all
its
matchless
beauty
and
redeeming
power
and
this
new
life
is
pushing
off
the
old
the
same
as
in
the
spring
the
newly
awakened
life
in
the
tree
pushes
off
the
old
lifeless
leaves
that
have
clung
on
during
the
winter
to
make
place
for
the
new
ones
and
the
way
this
old
dead
leaf
religion
is
being
pushed
off
on
every
hand
is
indeed
most
interesting
and
inspiring
to
witness
let
the
places
of
those
who
have
been
emptying
our
churches
by
reason
of
their
attempts
to
give
stones
for
bread
husks
and
chaff
for
the
grain
let
their
places
be
taken
even
for
but
a
few
times
by
those
who
are
open
and
alive
to
these
higher
inspirations
and
then
let
us
again
question
those
who
feel
that
religion
is
dying
out
it
is
the
live
coal
that
kindles
others
not
the
dead
let
their
places
be
taken
by
those
who
have
caught
the
inspiration
of
the
divine
breath
who
as
a
consequence
have
a
message
of
mighty
value
and
import
for
the
people
who
by
virtue
of
this
same
fact
are
able
to
present
it
with
a
beauty
and
a
power
so
enrapturing
that
it
takes
captive
the
soul
then
we
will
find
that
the
churches
that
today
are
dotted
here
and
there
with
a
few
dozen
people
will
be
filled
to
overflowing
and
there
will
not
be
even
room
enough
for
all
who
would
enter
let
the
shell
perish
that
the
pearl
may
appear
we
need
no
new
revelations
as
yet
we
need
simply
to
find
the
vital
spirit
of
those
we
already
have
then
in
due
time
when
we
are
ready
for
them
new
ones
will
come
but
not
before
what
the
human
soul
all
the
world
over
needs
says
john
pulsford
is
not
to
be
harangued
however
eloquently
about
the
old
accepted
religion
but
to
be
permeated
charmed
and
taken
captive
by
warmer
and
more
potent
breath
of
god
than
they
ever
felt
and
i
should
not
be
true
to
my
personal
experience
if
i
did
not
bear
testimony
that
this
divine
breath
is
as
exquisitely
adapted
to
the
requirements
of
the
soul
nature
as
a
june
morning
to
the
planet
nor
does
the
morning
breath
leave
the
trees
freer
to
delight
themselves
and
develop
themselves
under
its
influence
than
the
breath
of
god
allows
each
human
mind
to
unfold
according
to
its
genius
nothing
stirs
the
central
wheel
of
the
soul
like
the
breath
of
god
the
whole
man
is
quickened
his
senses
are
new
senses
his
emotions
new
emotions
his
reason
his
affections
his
imagination
are
all
the
change
is
greater
than
he
knows
he
marvels
at
the
powers
in
himself
which
the
breath
is
opening
and
calling
forth
he
finds
his
nature
to
be
an
unutterable
thing
he
is
sure
therefore
that
the
future
must
have
inconceivable
surprises
in
store
and
herein
lies
the
evidence
which
i
commend
to
my
readers
of
the
existence
of
god
and
of
the
eternal
human
hope
let
god
breath
kindle
new
in
the
soul
start
into
life
its
deeply
buried
germs
lead
in
heaven
summer
you
will
then
have
as
clear
evidence
of
god
from
within
as
you
have
of
the
universe
from
without
indeed
your
internal
experience
of
life
and
illimitable
hope
in
god
will
be
nearer
to
you
and
more
prevailing
than
all
your
external
and
superficial
experience
of
nature
and
the
world
there
is
but
one
source
of
power
in
the
universe
whatever
then
you
are
painter
orator
musician
writer
religious
teacher
or
whatever
it
may
be
know
that
to
catch
and
take
captive
the
secret
of
power
is
so
to
work
in
conjunction
with
the
infinite
power
in
order
that
it
may
continually
work
and
manifest
through
you
if
you
fail
in
doing
this
you
fail
in
everything
if
you
fail
in
doing
this
your
work
whatever
it
may
be
will
be
third
or
fourth
rate
possibly
at
times
second
rate
but
it
positively
never
can
be
first
rate
absolutely
impossible
will
it
be
for
you
ever
to
become
a
master
whatever
estimate
you
put
upon
yourself
will
determine
the
effectiveness
of
your
work
along
any
line
as
long
as
you
live
merely
in
the
physical
and
the
intellectual
you
set
limitations
to
yourself
that
will
hold
you
as
long
as
you
so
live
when
however
you
come
into
the
realization
of
your
oneness
with
the
infinite
life
and
power
and
open
yourself
that
it
may
work
through
you
you
will
find
that
you
have
entered
upon
an
entirely
new
phase
of
life
and
that
an
ever
increasing
power
will
be
yours
then
it
will
be
true
that
your
strength
will
be
as
the
strength
of
ten
because
your
heart
is
pure
o
god
i
am
one
forever
with
thee
by
the
glory
of
birth
the
celestial
powers
proclaim
it
to
the
utmost
bounds
of
the
earth
i
think
of
this
birthright
immortal
and
my
being
expands
like
a
rose
as
an
odorous
cloud
of
incense
around
and
above
me
flows
a
glorious
song
of
rejoicing
in
an
innermost
spirit
i
hear
and
it
sounds
like
heavenly
voices
in
a
chorus
divine
and
clear
and
i
feel
a
power
uprising
like
the
power
of
an
embryo
god
with
a
glorious
wall
it
surrounds
me
and
lifts
me
up
from
the
sod
plenty
of
all
things
the
law
of
prosperity
this
is
the
spirit
of
infinite
plenty
the
power
that
has
brought
that
is
continually
bringing
all
things
into
expression
in
material
form
he
who
lives
in
the
realization
of
his
oneness
with
this
infinite
power
becomes
a
magnet
to
attract
to
himself
a
continual
supply
of
whatsoever
things
he
desires
if
one
hold
himself
in
the
thought
of
poverty
he
will
be
poor
and
the
chances
are
that
he
will
remain
in
poverty
if
he
hold
himself
whatever
present
conditions
may
be
continually
in
the
thought
of
prosperity
he
sets
into
operation
forces
that
will
sooner
or
later
bring
him
into
prosperous
conditions
the
law
of
attraction
works
unceasingly
throughout
the
universe
and
the
one
great
and
never
changing
fact
in
connection
with
it
is
as
we
have
found
that
like
attracts
like
if
we
are
one
with
this
infinite
power
this
source
of
all
things
then
in
the
degree
that
we
live
in
the
realization
of
this
oneness
in
that
degree
do
we
actualize
in
ourselves
a
power
that
will
bring
to
us
an
abundance
of
all
things
that
it
is
desirable
for
us
to
have
in
this
way
we
come
into
possession
of
a
power
whereby
we
can
actualize
at
all
times
those
conditions
that
we
desire
as
all
truth
exists
and
awaits
simply
our
perception
of
it
so
all
things
necessary
for
present
needs
exist
and
await
simply
the
power
in
us
to
appropriate
them
god
holds
all
things
in
his
hands
his
constant
word
is
my
child
acknowledge
me
in
all
your
ways
and
in
the
degree
that
you
do
this
in
the
degree
that
you
live
this
then
what
is
mine
is
yours
the
lord
will
provide
he
giveth
to
all
men
liberally
and
upbraideth
not
he
giveth
liberally
to
all
men
who
put
themselves
in
the
right
attitude
to
receive
from
him
he
forces
no
good
things
upon
any
one
the
old
and
somewhat
prevalent
idea
of
godliness
and
poverty
has
absolutely
no
basis
for
its
existence
and
the
sooner
we
get
away
from
it
the
better
it
had
its
birth
in
the
same
way
that
the
idea
of
asceticism
came
into
existence
when
the
idea
prevailed
that
there
was
necessarily
a
warfare
between
the
flesh
and
the
spirit
it
had
its
origin
therefore
in
the
minds
of
those
who
had
a
distorted
a
view
of
life
true
godliness
is
in
a
sense
the
same
as
true
wisdom
the
one
who
is
truly
wise
and
who
uses
the
forces
and
powers
with
which
he
is
endowed
to
him
the
great
universe
always
opens
her
treasure
house
the
supply
is
always
equal
to
the
demand
equal
to
the
demand
when
the
demand
is
rightly
wisely
made
when
one
comes
into
the
realization
of
these
higher
laws
then
the
fear
of
want
ceases
to
tyrannize
over
him
are
you
out
of
a
situation
let
the
fear
that
you
will
not
get
another
take
hold
of
and
you
and
the
chances
are
that
it
may
be
a
long
time
before
you
will
get
another
or
the
one
that
you
do
get
may
be
a
very
poor
one
indeed
whatever
the
circumstances
you
must
realize
that
you
have
within
you
forces
and
powers
that
you
can
set
into
operation
that
will
triumph
over
any
and
all
apparent
or
temporary
losses
set
these
forces
into
operation
and
you
will
then
be
placing
a
magnet
that
will
draw
to
you
a
situation
that
may
be
far
better
than
the
one
you
have
lost
and
the
time
may
soon
come
when
you
will
be
even
thankful
that
you
lost
the
old
one
recognize
working
in
and
through
you
the
same
infinite
power
that
creates
and
governs
all
things
in
the
universe
the
same
infinite
power
that
governs
the
endless
systems
of
worlds
in
space
send
out
your
thought
thought
is
a
force
and
it
has
occult
power
of
unknown
proportions
when
rightly
used
and
wisely
directed
send
out
your
thought
that
the
right
situation
or
the
right
work
will
come
to
you
at
the
right
time
in
the
right
way
and
that
you
will
recognize
it
when
it
comes
hold
to
this
thought
never
allow
it
to
weaken
hold
to
it
and
continually
water
it
with
firm
expectation
you
in
this
way
put
your
advertisement
into
a
psychical
a
spiritual
newspaper
a
paper
that
has
not
a
limited
circulation
but
one
that
will
make
its
way
not
only
to
the
utmost
bounds
of
the
earth
but
of
the
very
universe
itself
it
is
an
advertisement
moreover
which
if
rightly
placed
on
your
part
will
be
far
more
effective
than
any
advertisement
you
could
possibly
put
into
any
printed
sheet
no
matter
what
claims
are
made
in
regard
to
its
being
the
great
advertising
medium
in
the
degree
that
you
come
into
this
realization
and
live
in
harmony
with
the
higher
laws
and
forces
in
that
degree
will
you
be
able
to
do
this
effectively
if
you
wish
to
look
through
the
want
columns
of
the
newspapers
then
do
it
not
in
the
ordinary
way
put
the
higher
forces
into
operation
and
thus
place
it
on
a
higher
basis
as
you
take
up
the
paper
take
this
attitude
of
mind
if
there
is
here
an
advertisement
that
it
will
be
well
for
me
to
reply
to
the
moment
i
come
to
it
i
will
recognize
it
affirm
this
believe
it
expect
it
if
you
do
this
in
full
faith
you
will
somehow
feel
the
intuition
the
moment
you
come
to
the
right
one
and
this
intuition
will
be
nothing
more
nor
less
than
your
own
soul
speaking
to
you
when
it
speaks
then
act
at
once
if
you
get
the
situation
and
it
does
not
prove
to
be
exactly
what
you
want
if
you
feel
that
you
are
capable
of
filling
a
better
one
then
the
moment
you
enter
upon
it
take
the
attitude
of
mind
that
this
situation
is
the
that
will
lead
you
to
one
that
will
be
still
better
hold
this
thought
steadily
affirm
it
believe
it
expect
it
and
all
the
time
be
faithful
to
the
situation
in
which
you
are
at
present
placed
if
you
are
faithful
to
it
then
the
chances
are
that
it
will
not
be
the
to
something
better
but
to
something
poorer
if
you
are
faithful
to
it
the
time
may
soon
come
when
you
will
be
glad
and
thankful
when
you
will
rejoice
that
you
lost
your
old
position
this
is
the
law
of
prosperity
when
apparent
adversity
comes
be
not
cast
down
by
it
but
make
the
best
of
it
and
always
look
forward
for
better
things
for
conditions
more
prosperous
to
hold
yourself
in
this
attitude
of
mind
is
to
set
into
operation
subtle
silent
and
irresistible
forces
that
sooner
or
later
will
actualize
in
material
form
that
which
is
today
merely
an
idea
but
ideas
have
occult
power
and
ideas
when
rightly
planted
and
rightly
tended
are
the
seeds
that
actualize
material
conditions
never
give
a
moment
to
complaint
but
utilize
the
time
that
would
otherwise
be
spent
in
this
way
in
looking
forward
and
actualizing
the
conditions
you
desire
suggest
prosperity
to
yourself
see
yourself
in
a
prosperous
condition
affirm
that
you
will
before
long
be
in
a
prosperous
condition
affirm
it
calmly
and
quietly
but
strongly
and
confidently
believe
it
believe
it
absolutely
expect
it
keep
it
continually
watered
with
expectation
you
thus
make
yourself
a
magnet
to
attract
the
things
that
you
desire
do
be
afraid
to
suggest
to
affirm
these
things
for
by
so
doing
you
put
forth
an
ideal
which
will
begin
to
clothe
itself
in
material
form
in
this
way
you
are
utilizing
agents
among
the
most
subtle
and
powerful
in
the
universe
if
you
are
particularly
desirous
for
anything
that
you
feel
it
is
good
and
right
for
you
to
have
something
that
will
broaden
your
life
or
that
will
increase
your
usefulness
to
others
simply
hold
the
thought
that
at
the
right
time
in
the
right
way
and
through
the
right
instrumentality
there
will
come
to
you
or
there
will
open
up
for
you
the
way
whereby
you
can
attain
what
you
desire
i
know
of
a
young
lady
who
a
short
time
ago
wanted
some
money
very
badly
she
wanted
it
for
a
good
purpose
she
saw
no
reason
why
she
should
have
it
she
is
one
who
has
come
into
an
understanding
of
the
power
of
the
interior
forces
she
took
and
held
herself
in
the
attitude
of
mind
we
have
just
pointed
out
in
the
morning
she
entered
into
the
silence
for
a
few
moments
in
this
way
she
brought
herself
into
a
more
complete
harmony
with
the
higher
powers
before
the
day
closed
a
gentleman
called
a
member
of
a
family
with
which
she
was
acquainted
he
asked
her
if
she
would
do
for
the
family
some
work
that
they
wanted
done
she
was
a
little
surprised
that
they
should
ask
her
to
do
this
particular
kind
of
work
but
she
said
to
herself
here
is
a
call
i
will
respond
and
see
what
it
will
lead
to
she
undertook
the
work
did
it
when
she
had
completed
it
there
was
put
into
her
hands
an
amount
of
money
far
beyond
what
she
had
expected
she
felt
that
it
was
an
amount
too
large
for
the
work
she
had
done
she
protested
they
replied
no
you
have
done
us
a
service
that
transcends
in
value
the
amount
we
offer
to
pay
you
the
sum
thus
received
was
more
than
sufficient
for
the
work
she
wished
to
accomplish
this
is
but
one
of
many
instances
in
connection
with
the
wise
and
effective
use
of
the
higher
powers
it
also
carries
a
lesson
fold
your
hands
and
expect
to
see
things
drop
into
your
lap
but
set
into
operation
the
higher
forces
and
then
take
hold
of
the
first
thing
that
offers
itself
do
what
your
hands
find
to
do
do
it
if
this
work
is
not
thoroughly
satisfactory
to
you
then
affirm
believe
and
expect
that
it
is
the
agency
that
will
lead
you
to
something
better
the
basis
for
attracting
the
best
of
all
the
world
can
give
to
you
is
to
first
surround
own
and
live
in
these
things
in
mind
or
what
is
falsely
called
imagination
all
imaginings
are
realities
and
forces
of
unseen
element
live
in
mind
in
a
palace
and
gradually
palatial
surroundings
will
gravitate
to
you
but
so
living
is
pining
or
longing
or
complainingly
wishing
it
is
when
you
are
in
the
world
calmly
and
persistently
seeing
yourself
as
up
it
is
when
you
are
now
compelled
to
eat
from
a
tin
plate
regarding
that
tin
plate
as
only
the
certain
step
to
one
of
silver
it
is
not
envying
and
growling
at
other
people
who
have
silver
plate
that
growling
is
just
so
much
capital
stock
taken
from
the
bank
account
of
mental
force
a
friend
who
knows
the
power
of
the
interior
forces
and
whose
life
is
guided
in
every
detail
by
them
has
given
a
suggestion
in
this
form
when
you
are
in
the
arms
of
the
bear
even
though
he
is
hugging
you
look
him
in
the
face
and
laugh
but
all
the
time
keep
your
eye
on
the
bull
if
you
allow
all
of
your
attention
to
be
given
to
the
work
of
the
bear
the
bull
may
get
entirely
out
of
your
sight
in
other
words
if
you
yield
to
adversity
the
chances
are
that
it
will
master
you
but
if
you
recognize
in
yourself
the
power
of
mastery
over
conditions
then
adversity
will
yield
to
you
and
will
be
changed
into
prosperity
if
when
it
comes
you
calmly
and
quietly
recognize
it
and
use
the
time
that
might
otherwise
be
spent
in
regrets
and
fears
and
forebodings
in
setting
into
operation
the
powerful
forces
within
you
it
will
soon
take
its
leave
faith
absolute
dogmatic
faith
is
the
only
law
of
true
success
when
we
recognize
the
fact
that
a
man
carries
his
success
or
his
failure
with
him
and
that
it
does
not
depend
upon
outside
conditions
we
will
come
into
the
possession
of
powers
that
will
quickly
change
outside
conditions
into
agencies
that
make
for
success
when
we
come
into
this
higher
realization
and
bring
our
lives
into
complete
harmony
with
the
higher
laws
we
will
then
be
able
so
to
focus
and
direct
the
awakened
interior
forces
that
they
will
go
out
and
return
laden
with
that
for
which
they
are
sent
we
will
then
be
great
enough
to
attract
success
and
it
will
not
always
be
apparently
just
a
little
ways
ahead
we
can
then
establish
in
ourselves
a
centre
so
strong
that
instead
of
running
hither
and
thither
for
this
or
that
we
can
stay
at
home
and
draw
to
us
the
conditions
we
desire
if
we
firmly
establish
and
hold
to
this
centre
things
will
seem
continually
to
come
our
way
the
majority
of
people
of
the
modern
world
are
looking
for
things
that
are
practical
and
that
can
be
utilized
in
life
the
more
carefully
we
examine
into
the
laws
underlying
the
great
truths
we
are
considering
the
more
we
will
find
that
they
are
not
only
eminently
practical
but
in
a
sense
and
in
the
deepest
and
truest
sense
they
are
the
only
practical
things
there
are
there
are
people
who
continually
pride
themselves
upon
being
exceedingly
practical
but
many
times
those
who
of
themselves
think
nothing
about
this
are
the
most
practical
people
the
world
knows
and
on
the
other
hand
those
who
take
great
pride
in
speaking
of
their
own
practicality
are
many
times
the
least
practical
or
again
in
some
ways
they
may
be
practical
but
so
far
as
life
in
its
totality
is
concerned
they
are
absurdly
impractical
what
profit
for
example
can
there
be
for
the
man
who
materially
speaking
though
he
has
gained
the
whole
world
has
never
yet
become
acquainted
with
his
own
soul
there
are
multitudes
of
men
all
about
us
who
are
entirely
missing
the
real
life
men
who
have
not
learned
even
the
a
b
c
of
true
living
slaves
they
are
abject
slaves
to
their
temporary
material
accumulations
men
who
thinking
they
possess
their
wealth
are
on
the
contrary
completely
possessed
by
it
men
whose
lives
are
comparatively
barren
in
service
to
those
about
them
and
to
the
world
at
large
men
who
when
they
can
no
longer
hold
the
body
the
agency
by
means
of
which
they
are
related
to
the
material
world
will
go
out
poor
indeed
pitiably
poor
unable
to
take
even
the
smallest
particle
of
their
accumulations
with
them
they
will
enter
upon
the
other
form
of
life
naked
and
destitute
the
kindly
deeds
the
developed
traits
of
character
the
realized
powers
of
the
soul
the
real
riches
of
the
inner
life
and
unfoldment
all
those
things
that
become
our
real
and
eternal
possessions
have
been
given
no
place
in
their
lives
and
so
of
the
real
things
of
life
they
are
destitute
nay
many
times
worse
than
destitute
we
must
not
suppose
that
habits
once
formed
are
any
more
easily
broken
off
in
the
other
form
of
life
than
they
are
in
this
if
one
voluntarily
grows
a
certain
mania
here
we
must
not
suppose
that
the
mere
dropping
of
the
body
makes
all
conditions
perfect
all
is
law
all
is
cause
and
effect
as
we
sow
so
shall
we
also
reap
not
only
in
this
life
but
in
all
lives
he
who
is
enslaved
with
the
sole
desire
for
material
possessions
here
will
continue
to
be
enslaved
even
after
he
can
no
longer
retain
his
body
then
moreover
he
will
have
not
even
the
means
of
gratifying
his
desires
dominated
by
this
habit
he
will
be
unable
to
set
his
affections
for
a
time
at
least
upon
other
things
and
the
desire
without
the
means
of
gratifying
it
will
be
doubly
torturing
to
him
perchance
this
torture
may
be
increased
by
his
seeing
the
accumulations
he
thought
were
his
now
being
scattered
and
wasted
by
spendthrifts
he
wills
his
property
as
we
say
to
others
but
he
can
have
no
word
as
to
its
use
how
foolish
then
for
us
to
think
that
any
material
possessions
how
absurd
for
example
for
one
to
fence
off
a
number
of
acres
of
god
earth
and
say
they
are
nothing
is
ours
that
we
can
not
retain
the
things
that
come
into
our
hands
come
not
for
the
purpose
of
being
possessed
as
we
say
much
less
for
the
purpose
of
being
hoarded
they
come
into
our
hands
to
be
used
to
be
wisely
used
we
are
stewards
merely
and
as
stewards
we
shall
be
held
accountable
for
the
way
we
use
whatever
is
entrusted
to
us
that
great
law
of
compensation
that
runs
through
all
life
is
wonderfully
exact
in
its
workings
although
we
may
not
always
fully
comprehend
it
or
even
recognize
it
when
it
operates
in
connection
with
ourselves
the
one
who
has
come
into
the
realization
of
the
higher
life
no
longer
has
a
desire
for
the
accumulation
of
enormous
wealth
any
more
than
he
has
a
desire
for
any
other
in
the
degree
that
he
comes
into
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
he
is
wealthy
within
external
wealth
becomes
less
important
in
his
estimation
when
he
comes
into
the
realization
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
source
within
from
which
he
can
put
forth
a
power
to
call
to
him
and
actualize
in
his
hands
at
any
time
a
sufficient
supply
for
all
his
needs
he
no
longer
burdens
himself
with
vast
material
accumulations
that
require
his
constant
care
and
attention
and
thus
take
his
time
and
his
thought
from
the
real
things
of
life
in
other
words
he
first
finds
the
and
he
realizes
that
when
he
has
found
this
all
other
things
follow
in
full
measure
it
is
as
hard
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
said
the
master
he
who
having
nothing
had
everything
as
it
is
for
a
camel
to
pass
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
in
other
words
if
a
man
give
all
his
time
to
the
accumulation
the
hoarding
of
outward
material
possessions
far
beyond
what
he
can
possibly
ever
use
what
time
has
he
for
the
finding
of
that
wonderful
kingdom
which
when
found
brings
all
else
with
it
which
is
better
to
have
millions
of
dollars
and
to
have
the
burden
of
taking
care
of
it
all
for
the
one
always
involves
the
other
or
to
come
into
the
knowledge
of
such
laws
and
forces
that
every
need
will
be
supplied
in
good
time
to
know
that
no
good
thing
shall
be
withheld
to
know
that
we
have
it
in
our
power
to
make
the
supply
always
equal
to
the
demand
the
one
who
enters
into
the
realm
of
this
higher
knowledge
never
cares
to
bring
upon
himself
the
species
of
insanity
that
has
such
a
firm
hold
upon
so
many
in
the
world
today
he
avoids
it
as
he
would
avoid
any
loathsome
disease
of
the
body
when
we
come
into
the
realization
of
the
higher
powers
we
will
then
be
able
to
give
more
attention
to
the
real
life
instead
of
giving
so
much
to
the
piling
up
of
vast
possessions
that
hamper
rather
than
help
it
it
is
the
medium
ground
that
brings
the
true
solution
here
the
same
as
it
is
in
all
phases
of
life
wealth
beyond
a
certain
amount
can
not
be
used
and
when
it
can
not
be
used
it
then
becomes
a
hindrance
rather
than
an
aid
a
curse
rather
than
a
blessing
all
about
us
are
persons
with
lives
now
stunted
and
dwarfed
who
could
make
them
rich
and
beautiful
filled
with
a
perennial
joy
if
they
would
begin
wisely
to
use
that
which
they
have
spent
the
greater
portion
of
their
lives
in
accumulating
the
man
who
accumulates
during
his
entire
life
and
who
leaves
even
all
when
he
goes
out
for
benevolent
purposes
comes
far
short
of
the
ideal
life
it
is
but
a
poor
excuse
of
a
life
it
is
not
especially
commendable
in
me
to
give
a
pair
of
old
shoes
that
i
shall
never
use
again
to
another
who
is
in
need
of
shoes
but
it
is
commendable
if
indeed
doing
anything
we
ought
to
do
can
be
spoken
of
as
being
commendable
it
is
commendable
for
me
to
give
a
good
pair
of
strong
shoes
to
the
man
who
in
the
midst
of
a
severe
winter
is
practically
shoeless
the
man
who
is
exerting
every
effort
to
earn
an
honest
living
and
thereby
take
care
of
his
family
needs
and
if
in
giving
the
shoes
i
also
give
myself
he
then
has
a
double
gift
and
i
a
double
blessing
there
is
no
wiser
use
that
those
who
have
great
accumulations
can
make
of
them
than
wisely
to
put
them
into
life
into
character
by
day
while
they
in
this
way
their
lives
will
be
continually
enriched
and
increased
the
time
will
come
when
it
will
be
regarded
as
a
disgrace
for
a
man
to
die
and
leave
vast
accumulations
behind
him
many
a
person
is
living
in
a
palace
today
who
in
the
real
life
is
poorer
than
many
a
one
who
has
not
even
a
roof
to
cover
him
a
man
may
own
and
live
in
a
palace
but
the
palace
for
him
may
be
a
still
moth
and
rust
are
nature
wise
provisions
god
methods
for
disintegrating
and
scattering
in
this
way
getting
ready
for
use
in
new
forms
that
which
is
hoarded
and
consequently
serving
no
use
there
is
also
a
great
law
continually
operating
whose
effects
are
to
dwarf
and
deaden
the
powers
of
true
enjoyment
as
well
as
all
the
higher
faculties
of
the
one
who
hoards
multitudes
of
people
are
continually
keeping
away
from
them
higher
and
better
things
because
they
are
forever
clinging
on
to
the
old
if
they
would
use
and
pass
on
the
old
room
would
be
made
for
new
things
to
come
hoarding
always
brings
loss
in
one
form
or
another
using
wisely
using
brings
an
ever
renewing
gain
if
the
tree
should
as
ignorantly
and
as
greedily
hold
on
to
this
leaves
when
they
have
served
their
purpose
where
would
be
the
full
and
beautiful
new
life
that
will
be
put
forth
in
the
spring
gradual
decay
and
finally
death
would
be
the
result
if
the
tree
is
already
dead
then
it
may
perhaps
be
well
enough
for
it
to
cling
on
to
the
old
for
no
new
leaves
will
come
but
as
long
as
the
life
in
the
tree
is
active
it
is
that
it
rid
itself
of
the
old
ones
that
room
may
be
made
for
the
new
opulence
is
the
law
of
the
universe
an
abundant
supply
for
every
need
if
nothing
is
put
in
the
way
of
its
coming
the
natural
and
the
normal
life
for
us
is
this
to
have
such
a
fullness
of
life
and
power
by
living
so
continually
in
the
realization
of
our
oneness
with
the
infinite
life
and
power
that
we
find
ourselves
in
the
constant
possession
of
an
abundant
supply
of
all
things
needed
then
not
by
hoarding
but
by
wisely
using
and
ridding
ourselves
of
things
as
they
come
an
ever
renewing
supply
will
be
ours
a
supply
far
better
adapted
to
present
needs
than
the
old
could
possibly
be
in
this
way
we
not
only
come
into
possession
of
the
richest
treasures
of
the
infinite
good
ourselves
but
we
also
become
open
channels
through
which
they
can
flow
to
others
how
men
have
become
prophets
seers
sages
and
saviours
i
have
tried
thus
far
to
deal
fairly
with
you
in
presenting
these
vital
truths
and
have
spoken
of
everything
on
the
basis
of
our
own
reason
and
insight
it
has
been
my
aim
to
base
nothing
on
the
teachings
of
others
though
they
may
be
the
teachings
of
those
inspired
let
us
now
look
for
a
moment
at
these
same
great
truths
in
the
light
of
the
thoughts
and
the
teachings
as
put
forth
by
some
of
the
world
great
thinkers
and
inspired
teachers
the
sum
and
substance
of
the
thought
presented
in
these
pages
is
you
will
remember
that
the
great
central
fact
in
human
life
is
the
coming
into
a
conscious
vital
realization
of
our
oneness
with
the
infinite
life
and
the
opening
of
ourselves
fully
to
this
divine
inflow
i
and
the
father
are
one
said
the
master
in
this
we
see
how
he
recognized
his
oneness
with
the
father
life
again
he
said
the
words
that
i
speak
unto
you
i
speak
not
of
myself
but
the
father
that
dwelleth
in
me
he
doeth
the
works
in
this
we
see
how
clearly
he
recognized
the
fact
that
he
of
himself
could
do
nothing
only
as
he
worked
in
conjunction
with
the
father
again
my
father
works
and
i
work
in
other
words
my
father
sends
the
power
i
open
myself
to
it
and
work
in
conjunction
with
it
again
he
said
seek
ye
first
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
righteousness
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
you
and
he
left
us
not
in
the
dark
as
to
exactly
what
he
meant
by
this
for
again
he
said
say
not
lo
here
nor
lo
there
know
ye
not
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
within
you
according
to
his
teaching
the
kingdom
of
god
and
the
kingdom
of
heaven
were
one
and
the
same
if
then
his
teaching
is
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
within
us
do
we
not
clearly
see
that
putting
it
in
other
words
his
injunction
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
come
ye
into
a
conscious
realization
of
your
oneness
with
the
father
life
as
you
realize
this
oneness
you
find
the
kingdom
and
when
you
find
this
all
things
else
shall
follow
the
story
of
the
prodigal
son
is
another
beautiful
illustration
of
this
same
great
teaching
of
the
master
after
the
prodigal
had
spent
everything
after
he
had
wandered
in
all
the
realms
of
the
physical
senses
in
the
pursuit
of
happiness
and
pleasure
and
found
that
this
did
not
satisfy
but
only
brought
him
to
the
level
of
the
animal
creation
he
then
came
to
his
senses
and
said
i
will
arise
and
go
to
my
father
in
other
words
after
all
these
wanderings
his
own
soul
at
length
spoke
to
him
and
said
you
are
not
a
mere
animal
you
are
your
father
child
arise
and
go
to
your
father
who
holds
all
things
in
his
hands
again
the
master
said
call
no
man
your
father
upon
the
earth
for
one
is
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
here
he
recognized
the
fact
that
the
real
life
is
direct
from
the
life
of
god
our
fathers
and
our
mothers
are
the
agents
that
give
us
the
bodies
the
houses
in
which
we
live
but
the
real
life
comes
from
the
infinite
source
of
life
god
who
is
our
father
one
day
word
was
brought
to
the
master
that
his
mother
and
his
brethren
were
without
wishing
to
speak
with
him
who
is
my
mother
and
who
are
my
brethren
said
he
whosoever
shall
do
the
will
of
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
the
same
is
my
brother
and
my
sister
and
mother
many
people
are
greatly
enslaved
by
what
we
term
ties
of
relationship
it
is
well
however
for
us
to
remember
that
our
true
relatives
are
not
necessarily
those
who
are
connected
with
us
by
ties
of
blood
our
truest
relatives
are
those
who
are
nearest
akin
to
us
in
mind
in
soul
in
spirit
our
nearest
relatives
may
be
those
living
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
globe
people
whom
we
may
never
have
seen
as
yet
but
to
whom
we
will
yet
be
drawn
either
in
this
form
of
life
or
in
another
through
that
ever
working
and
never
failing
law
of
attraction
when
the
master
gave
the
injunction
call
no
man
your
father
upon
the
earth
for
one
is
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
he
here
gave
us
the
basis
for
that
grand
conception
of
the
fatherhood
of
god
and
if
god
is
equally
the
father
of
all
then
we
have
here
the
basis
for
the
brotherhood
of
man
but
there
is
in
a
sense
a
conception
still
higher
than
this
namely
the
oneness
of
man
and
god
and
hence
the
oneness
of
the
whole
human
race
when
we
realize
this
fact
then
we
clearly
see
how
in
the
degree
that
we
come
into
the
realization
of
our
oneness
with
the
infinite
life
and
so
every
step
that
we
make
godward
we
aid
in
lifting
all
mankind
up
to
this
realization
and
enable
them
in
turn
to
make
a
step
the
master
again
pointed
out
our
true
relations
with
the
infinite
life
when
he
said
except
ye
become
as
little
children
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
when
he
said
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
he
gave
utterance
to
a
truth
of
far
greater
import
than
we
have
as
yet
commenced
fully
to
grasp
here
he
taught
that
even
the
physical
life
can
not
be
maintained
by
material
food
alone
but
that
one
connection
with
this
infinite
source
determines
to
a
very
great
extent
the
condition
of
even
the
bodily
structure
and
activities
blessed
are
the
pure
in
heart
for
they
shall
see
god
in
other
words
blessed
are
they
who
in
all
the
universe
recognize
only
god
for
by
such
god
shall
be
seen
said
the
great
hindu
sage
manu
he
who
in
his
own
soul
perceives
the
supreme
soul
in
all
beings
and
acquires
equanimity
toward
them
all
attains
the
highest
bliss
it
was
athanasius
who
said
even
we
may
become
gods
walking
about
in
the
flesh
the
same
great
truth
we
are
considering
is
the
one
that
runs
through
the
life
and
the
teachings
of
gautama
he
who
became
the
buddha
people
are
in
bondage
said
he
because
they
have
not
yet
removed
the
idea
of
to
do
away
with
all
sense
of
separateness
and
to
recognize
the
oneness
of
the
self
with
the
infinite
is
the
spirit
that
breathes
through
all
his
teachings
running
through
the
lives
of
all
the
mediaeval
mystics
was
this
same
great
truth
union
with
god
then
coming
nearer
to
our
own
time
we
find
the
highly
illumined
seer
emanuel
swedenborg
pointing
out
the
great
laws
in
connection
with
what
he
termed
the
divine
influx
and
how
we
may
open
ourselves
more
fully
to
its
operations
the
great
central
fact
in
the
religion
and
worship
of
the
friends
is
the
inner
light
god
in
the
soul
of
man
speaking
directly
in
just
the
degree
that
the
soul
is
opened
to
him
the
inspired
one
the
seer
who
when
with
us
lived
at
concord
recognized
the
same
great
truth
when
he
said
we
are
all
inlets
to
the
great
sea
of
life
and
it
was
by
opening
himself
so
fully
to
its
inflow
that
he
became
one
inspired
all
through
the
world
history
we
find
that
the
men
and
the
women
who
have
entered
into
the
realm
of
true
wisdom
and
power
and
hence
into
the
realm
of
true
peace
and
joy
have
lived
in
harmony
with
this
higher
power
david
was
strong
and
powerful
and
his
soul
burst
forth
in
praise
and
adoration
in
just
the
degree
that
he
listened
to
the
voice
of
god
and
lived
in
accordance
with
his
higher
promptings
whenever
he
failed
to
do
this
we
hear
his
soul
crying
out
in
anguish
and
lamentation
the
same
is
true
of
every
nation
or
people
when
the
israelites
acknowledged
god
and
followed
according
to
his
leadings
they
were
prosperous
contented
and
powerful
and
nothing
could
prevail
against
them
when
they
depended
upon
their
own
strength
alone
and
failed
to
recognize
god
as
the
source
of
their
strength
we
find
them
overcome
in
bondage
or
despair
a
great
immutable
law
underlies
the
truth
blessed
are
they
that
hear
the
word
of
god
and
do
it
then
follows
all
we
are
wise
in
the
degree
that
we
live
according
to
the
higher
light
all
the
prophets
seers
sages
and
saviours
in
the
world
history
became
what
they
became
and
consequently
had
the
powers
they
had
through
an
entirely
natural
process
they
all
recognized
and
came
into
the
conscious
realization
of
their
oneness
with
the
infinite
life
god
is
no
respecter
of
persons
he
does
create
prophets
seers
sages
and
saviours
as
such
he
creates
men
but
here
and
there
one
recognizes
his
true
identity
recognizes
the
oneness
of
his
life
with
the
source
whence
it
came
he
lives
in
the
realization
of
this
oneness
and
in
turn
becomes
a
prophet
seer
sage
or
saviour
neither
is
god
a
respecter
of
races
or
of
nations
he
has
no
chosen
people
but
here
and
there
a
race
or
nation
becomes
a
respecter
of
god
and
hence
lives
the
life
of
a
chosen
people
there
has
been
no
age
or
place
of
miracles
in
distinction
from
any
other
age
or
place
what
we
term
miracles
have
abounded
in
all
places
and
at
all
times
where
conditions
have
been
made
for
them
they
are
being
performed
today
just
as
much
as
they
ever
have
been
when
the
laws
governing
them
are
respected
mighty
men
we
are
told
they
were
mighty
men
who
walked
with
god
and
in
the
words
who
walked
with
god
lies
the
secret
of
the
words
mighty
men
cause
effect
the
lord
never
prospers
any
man
but
the
man
prospers
because
he
acknowledges
the
lord
and
lives
in
accordance
with
the
higher
laws
solomon
was
given
the
opportunity
of
choosing
whatever
he
desired
his
better
judgment
prevailed
and
he
chose
wisdom
but
when
he
chose
wisdom
he
found
that
it
included
all
else
beside
we
are
told
that
god
hardened
pharaoh
heart
i
do
believe
it
god
never
hardens
any
one
heart
pharaoh
hardened
his
own
heart
and
god
was
blamed
for
it
but
when
pharaoh
hardened
his
heart
and
disobeyed
the
voice
of
god
the
plagues
came
again
cause
effect
had
he
on
the
contrary
listened
in
other
words
had
he
opened
himself
to
and
obeyed
the
voice
of
god
the
plagues
would
not
have
come
we
can
be
our
own
best
friends
or
we
can
be
our
own
worst
enemies
in
the
degree
that
we
become
friends
to
the
highest
and
best
within
us
we
become
friends
to
all
and
in
the
degree
that
we
become
enemies
to
the
highest
and
best
within
us
do
we
become
enemies
to
all
in
the
degree
that
we
open
ourselves
to
the
higher
powers
and
let
them
manifest
through
us
then
by
the
very
inspirations
we
carry
with
us
do
we
become
in
a
sense
the
saviours
of
our
and
in
this
way
we
all
are
or
may
become
the
saviours
one
of
another
in
this
way
you
may
become
indeed
one
of
the
world
redeemers
the
basic
principle
of
all
religions
the
universal
religion
the
great
truth
we
are
considering
is
the
fundamental
principle
running
through
all
religions
we
find
it
in
every
one
in
regard
to
it
all
agree
it
is
moreover
a
great
truth
in
regard
to
which
all
people
can
agree
whether
they
belong
to
the
same
or
to
different
religions
people
always
quarrel
about
the
trifles
about
their
personal
views
of
minor
insignificant
points
they
always
come
together
in
the
presence
of
great
fundamental
truths
the
threads
of
which
run
through
all
the
quarrels
are
in
connection
with
the
lower
self
the
agreements
are
in
connection
with
the
higher
self
a
place
may
have
its
factions
that
quarrel
and
fight
among
themselves
but
let
a
great
calamity
come
upon
the
land
flood
famine
pestilence
and
these
little
personal
differences
are
entirely
forgotten
and
all
work
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
the
one
great
cause
the
changing
the
evolving
self
gives
rise
to
quarrels
the
permanent
the
soul
self
unites
all
in
the
highest
efforts
of
love
and
service
patriotism
is
a
beautiful
thing
it
is
well
for
me
to
love
my
country
but
why
should
i
love
my
own
country
more
than
i
love
all
others
if
i
love
my
own
and
hate
others
i
then
show
my
limitations
and
my
patriotism
will
stand
the
test
not
even
for
my
own
if
i
love
my
own
country
and
in
the
same
way
love
all
other
countries
then
i
show
the
largeness
of
my
nature
and
a
patriotism
of
this
kind
is
noble
and
always
to
be
relied
upon
the
view
of
god
in
regard
to
which
we
are
agreed
that
he
is
the
infinite
spirit
of
life
and
power
that
is
back
of
all
that
is
working
in
and
through
all
that
is
the
life
of
all
is
a
matter
in
regard
to
which
all
men
all
religions
can
agree
with
this
view
there
can
be
no
infidels
or
atheists
there
are
atheists
and
infidels
in
connection
with
many
views
that
are
held
concerning
god
and
thank
god
there
are
even
devout
and
earnest
people
among
us
attribute
things
to
god
that
no
respectable
men
or
women
would
permit
to
be
attributed
to
themselves
this
view
is
satisfying
to
those
who
can
not
see
how
god
can
be
angry
with
his
children
jealous
vindictive
a
display
of
these
qualities
always
lessens
our
respect
for
men
and
women
and
still
we
attribute
them
to
god
the
earnest
sincere
heretic
is
one
of
the
greatest
friends
true
religion
can
have
heretics
are
among
god
greatest
servants
they
are
among
the
true
servants
of
mankind
christ
was
one
of
the
greatest
heretics
the
world
has
ever
known
he
allowed
himself
to
be
bound
by
no
established
or
orthodox
teachings
or
beliefs
christ
is
preëminently
a
type
of
the
universal
john
the
baptist
is
a
type
of
the
personal
john
dressed
in
a
particular
way
ate
a
particular
kind
of
food
belonged
to
a
particular
order
lived
and
taught
in
a
particular
locality
and
he
himself
recognized
the
fact
that
he
must
decrease
while
christ
must
increase
christ
on
the
other
hand
gave
himself
absolutely
no
limitations
he
allowed
himself
to
be
bound
by
nothing
he
was
absolutely
universal
and
as
a
consequence
taught
not
for
his
own
particular
day
but
for
all
time
this
mighty
truth
which
we
have
agreed
upon
as
the
great
central
fact
of
human
life
is
the
golden
thread
that
runs
through
all
religions
when
we
make
it
the
paramount
fact
in
our
lives
we
will
find
that
minor
differences
narrow
prejudices
and
all
these
laughable
absurdities
will
so
fall
away
by
virtue
of
their
very
insignificance
that
a
jew
can
worship
equally
as
well
in
a
catholic
cathedral
a
catholic
in
a
jewish
synagogue
a
buddhist
in
a
christian
church
a
christian
in
a
buddhist
temple
or
all
can
worship
equally
well
about
their
own
or
out
on
the
hillside
or
while
pursuing
the
avocations
of
life
for
true
worship
only
god
and
the
human
soul
are
necessary
it
does
not
depend
upon
times
or
seasons
or
occasions
anywhere
and
at
any
time
god
and
man
in
the
bush
may
meet
this
is
the
great
fundamental
principle
of
the
universal
religion
upon
which
all
can
agree
this
is
the
great
fact
that
is
permanent
there
are
many
things
in
regard
to
which
all
can
not
agree
these
are
the
things
that
are
personal
and
so
as
time
passes
they
gradually
fall
away
one
who
does
grasp
this
great
truth
a
christian
for
example
asks
but
was
not
christ
inspired
yes
but
he
was
not
the
only
one
inspired
another
who
is
a
buddhist
asks
was
not
buddha
inspired
yes
but
he
was
not
the
only
one
inspired
a
christian
asks
but
is
not
our
christian
bible
inspired
yes
but
there
are
other
inspired
scriptures
a
brahmin
or
a
buddhist
asks
are
not
the
vedas
inspired
yes
but
there
are
other
inspired
sacred
books
your
error
is
not
in
believing
that
your
particular
scriptures
are
inspired
but
your
error
is
and
you
show
your
absurdly
laughable
limitations
by
it
your
inability
to
see
that
other
scriptures
are
also
inspired
the
sacred
books
the
inspired
writings
all
come
from
the
same
source
god
god
speaking
through
the
souls
of
those
who
open
themselves
that
he
may
thus
speak
some
may
be
more
inspired
than
others
it
depends
entirely
on
the
relative
degree
that
this
one
or
that
one
opens
himself
to
the
divine
voice
says
one
of
the
inspired
writers
in
the
hebrew
scriptures
wisdom
is
the
breath
of
the
power
of
god
and
all
entering
into
holy
souls
she
maketh
them
friends
of
god
and
prophets
let
us
not
be
among
the
number
so
dwarfed
so
limited
so
bigoted
as
to
think
that
the
infinite
god
has
revealed
himself
to
one
little
handful
of
his
children
in
one
little
quarter
of
the
globe
and
at
one
particular
period
of
time
this
is
the
pattern
by
which
god
works
of
a
truth
i
perceive
that
god
is
no
respecter
of
persons
but
in
every
nation
he
that
revereth
god
and
worketh
righteousness
is
accepted
of
him
says
the
christian
bible
when
we
fully
realize
this
truth
we
will
then
see
that
it
makes
but
little
difference
what
particular
form
of
religion
one
holds
to
but
it
does
make
a
tremendous
difference
how
true
he
is
to
the
principles
of
this
one
in
the
degree
that
we
love
self
less
and
love
truth
more
in
that
degree
will
we
care
less
about
converting
people
to
our
particular
way
of
thinking
but
all
the
more
will
we
care
to
aid
them
in
coming
into
the
full
realization
of
truth
through
the
channels
best
adapted
to
them
the
doctrine
of
our
master
says
the
chinese
consisted
solely
in
integrity
of
heart
we
will
find
as
we
search
that
this
is
the
doctrine
of
every
one
who
is
at
all
worthy
the
name
of
master
the
great
fundamental
principles
of
all
religions
are
the
same
they
differ
only
in
their
minor
details
according
to
the
various
degrees
of
unfoldment
of
different
people
i
am
sometimes
asked
to
what
religion
do
you
belong
what
religion
why
bless
you
there
is
only
one
religion
the
religion
of
the
living
god
there
are
of
course
the
various
creeds
of
the
same
religion
arising
from
the
various
interpretations
of
different
people
but
they
are
all
of
minor
importance
the
more
unfolded
the
soul
the
less
important
do
these
minor
differences
become
there
are
also
of
course
the
various
religions
there
is
in
reality
however
but
one
religion
the
moment
we
lose
sight
of
this
great
fact
we
depart
from
the
real
vital
spirit
of
true
religion
and
allow
ourselves
to
be
limited
and
bound
by
form
in
the
degree
that
we
do
this
we
build
fences
around
ourselves
which
keep
others
away
from
us
and
which
also
prevent
our
coming
into
the
realization
of
universal
truth
there
is
nothing
worthy
the
name
of
truth
that
is
not
universal
there
is
only
one
religion
whatever
road
i
take
joins
the
highway
that
leads
to
thee
says
the
inspired
writer
in
the
persian
scriptures
broad
is
the
carpet
god
has
spread
and
beautiful
the
colors
he
has
given
it
the
pure
man
respects
every
form
of
faith
says
the
buddhist
my
doctrine
makes
no
difference
between
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
like
the
sky
it
has
room
for
all
and
like
the
water
it
washes
all
alike
the
broad
minded
see
the
truth
in
different
religions
the
narrow
minded
see
only
the
differences
says
the
chinese
the
hindu
has
said
the
narrow
minded
ask
this
man
a
stranger
or
is
he
of
our
tribe
but
to
those
in
whom
love
dwells
the
whole
world
is
but
one
family
altar
flowers
are
of
many
species
but
all
worship
is
one
heaven
is
a
palace
with
many
doors
and
each
may
enter
in
his
own
way
are
we
not
all
children
of
one
father
says
the
christian
god
has
made
of
one
blood
all
nations
to
dwell
on
the
face
of
the
earth
it
was
a
seer
who
said
that
which
was
profitable
to
the
soul
of
man
the
father
revealed
to
the
ancients
that
which
is
profitable
to
the
soul
of
man
today
revealeth
he
this
day
it
was
tennyson
who
said
i
dreamed
that
stone
by
stone
i
reared
a
sacred
fane
a
temple
neither
pagoda
mosque
nor
church
but
loftier
simpler
always
to
every
breath
from
heaven
and
truth
and
peace
and
love
and
justice
came
and
dwelt
therein
religion
in
its
true
sense
is
the
most
joyous
thing
the
human
soul
can
know
and
when
the
real
religion
is
realized
we
will
find
that
it
will
be
an
agent
of
peace
of
joy
and
of
happiness
and
never
an
agent
of
gloomy
sadness
it
will
then
be
attractive
to
all
and
repulsive
to
none
let
our
churches
grasp
these
great
truths
let
them
give
their
time
and
attention
to
bringing
people
into
a
knowledge
of
their
true
selves
into
a
knowledge
of
their
relations
of
their
oneness
with
the
infinite
god
and
such
joy
will
be
the
result
and
such
crowds
will
flock
to
them
that
their
very
walls
will
seem
almost
to
burst
and
such
songs
of
joy
will
continually
pour
forth
as
will
make
all
people
in
love
with
the
religion
that
makes
for
life
and
hence
the
religion
that
is
true
and
vital
adequacy
for
life
adequacy
for
everyday
life
here
and
now
must
be
the
test
of
all
true
religion
if
it
does
not
bear
this
test
then
it
simply
is
not
religion
we
need
an
everyday
a
religion
all
time
spent
in
connection
with
any
other
is
worse
than
wasted
the
eternal
life
that
we
are
now
living
will
be
well
lived
if
we
take
good
care
of
each
little
period
of
time
as
it
presents
itself
day
after
day
if
we
fail
in
doing
this
we
fail
in
everything
entering
now
into
the
realization
of
the
highest
riches
i
hear
the
question
what
can
be
said
in
a
concrete
way
in
regard
to
the
method
of
coming
into
this
realization
the
facts
underlying
it
are
indeed
most
beautiful
and
true
but
how
can
we
actualize
in
ourselves
the
realization
that
carries
with
it
such
wonderful
results
the
method
is
not
difficult
if
we
do
not
of
ourselves
make
it
difficult
the
principal
word
to
be
used
is
the
word
open
simply
to
open
your
mind
and
heart
to
this
divine
inflow
which
is
waiting
only
for
the
opening
of
the
gate
that
it
may
enter
it
is
like
opening
the
gate
of
the
trough
which
conducts
the
water
from
the
reservoir
above
into
the
field
below
the
water
by
virtue
of
its
very
nature
will
rush
in
and
irrigate
the
field
if
the
gate
is
but
opened
as
to
the
realization
of
our
oneness
with
this
infinite
life
and
power
after
seeing
as
i
think
we
have
clearly
seen
by
this
time
the
relations
it
bears
to
us
and
we
to
it
the
chief
thing
to
be
said
is
simply
realize
your
oneness
with
it
the
open
mind
and
heart
whereby
one
is
brought
into
the
receptive
attitude
is
the
first
thing
necessary
then
the
earnest
sincere
desire
it
may
be
an
aid
at
first
to
take
yourself
for
a
few
moments
each
day
into
the
quiet
into
the
silence
where
you
will
not
be
agitated
by
the
disturbances
that
enter
in
through
the
avenues
of
the
physical
senses
there
in
the
quiet
alone
with
god
put
yourself
into
the
receptive
attitude
calmly
quietly
and
expectantly
desire
that
this
realization
break
in
upon
and
take
possession
of
your
soul
as
it
breaks
in
upon
and
takes
possession
of
the
soul
it
will
manifest
itself
to
your
mind
and
from
this
you
will
feel
its
manifestations
in
every
part
of
your
body
then
in
the
degree
that
you
open
yourself
to
it
you
will
feel
a
quiet
peaceful
illuminating
power
that
will
harmonize
body
soul
and
mind
and
that
will
then
harmonize
these
with
all
the
world
you
are
now
on
the
mountain
top
and
the
voice
of
god
is
speaking
to
you
as
you
descend
carry
this
realization
with
live
in
it
waking
working
thinking
walking
sleeping
in
this
way
although
you
may
not
be
continually
on
the
mountain
top
you
will
nevertheless
be
continually
living
in
the
realization
of
all
the
beauty
and
inspiration
and
power
you
have
felt
there
moreover
the
time
will
come
when
in
the
busy
office
or
on
the
noisy
street
you
can
enter
into
the
silence
by
simply
drawing
the
mantle
of
your
own
thoughts
about
you
and
realizing
that
there
and
everywhere
the
spirit
of
infinite
life
love
wisdom
peace
power
and
plenty
is
guiding
keeping
protecting
leading
you
this
is
the
spirit
of
continual
prayer
this
it
is
to
pray
without
ceasing
this
it
is
to
know
and
to
walk
with
god
it
is
to
find
the
christ
this
is
the
new
birth
the
second
birth
first
that
which
is
natural
then
that
which
is
spiritual
it
is
thus
that
the
old
man
adam
is
put
off
and
the
new
man
christ
is
put
on
this
it
is
to
be
saved
unto
life
eternal
whatever
one
form
of
belief
or
faith
may
be
for
it
is
life
eternal
to
know
god
the
sweet
by
and
by
will
be
a
song
of
the
past
we
will
create
a
new
song
the
beautiful
eternal
now
this
is
the
realization
that
you
and
i
can
come
into
this
very
day
this
very
hour
this
very
minute
if
we
desire
and
if
we
will
it
and
if
now
we
merely
set
our
faces
in
the
right
direction
it
is
then
but
a
matter
of
time
until
we
come
into
the
full
splendors
of
this
complete
realization
to
set
one
face
in
the
direction
of
the
mountain
and
then
simply
to
journey
on
whether
rapidly
or
more
slowly
will
bring
him
to
it
but
unless
one
set
his
face
in
the
right
direction
and
make
the
start
he
will
not
reach
it
it
was
goethe
who
said
are
you
in
earnest
seize
this
very
minute
what
you
can
do
or
dream
you
can
begin
it
boldness
has
genius
power
and
magic
in
it
only
engage
and
then
the
mind
grows
heated
begin
and
then
the
work
will
be
completed
said
the
young
man
gautama
siddhârtha
i
have
awakened
to
the
truth
and
i
am
resolved
to
accomplish
my
purpose
verily
i
shall
become
a
buddha
it
was
this
that
brought
him
into
the
life
of
the
enlightened
one
and
so
into
the
realization
of
nirvana
right
here
in
this
life
that
this
same
realization
and
life
is
within
the
possibilities
of
all
here
and
now
was
his
teaching
it
was
this
that
has
made
him
the
light
bearer
to
millions
of
people
said
the
young
man
jesus
know
ye
not
that
i
must
be
about
my
business
making
this
the
one
great
purpose
of
his
life
he
came
into
the
full
and
complete
realization
i
and
the
father
are
one
he
thus
came
into
the
full
realization
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
right
here
in
this
life
that
all
could
come
into
this
same
realization
and
life
here
and
now
was
his
teaching
it
was
this
that
has
made
him
the
light
bearer
to
millions
of
people
and
so
far
as
practical
things
are
concerned
we
may
hunt
the
wide
universe
through
and
we
shall
find
that
there
is
no
injunction
more
practical
than
seek
ye
first
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
righteousness
and
all
other
things
shall
be
added
unto
you
and
in
the
light
of
what
has
gone
before
i
think
there
is
no
one
who
is
open
to
truth
and
honest
with
himself
who
will
fail
to
grasp
the
underlying
reason
and
see
the
great
laws
upon
which
it
is
based
personally
i
know
lives
that
have
so
fully
entered
into
the
kingdom
through
the
realization
of
their
oneness
with
the
infinite
life
and
through
the
opening
of
themselves
so
fully
to
its
divine
guidance
that
they
are
most
wonderful
concrete
examples
of
the
reality
of
this
great
and
truth
they
are
people
whose
lives
are
in
this
way
guided
not
only
in
a
general
way
but
literally
in
every
detail
they
simply
live
in
the
realization
of
their
oneness
with
this
infinite
power
continually
in
harmony
with
it
and
so
continually
in
the
realization
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
an
abundance
of
all
things
is
theirs
they
are
never
at
a
loss
for
anything
the
supply
seems
always
equal
to
the
demand
they
never
seem
at
a
loss
in
regard
to
what
to
do
or
how
to
do
it
their
lives
are
lives
they
are
lives
free
from
care
because
they
are
continually
conscious
of
the
fact
that
the
higher
powers
are
doing
the
guiding
and
they
are
relieved
of
the
responsibility
to
enter
into
detail
in
connection
with
some
of
these
lives
and
particularly
with
two
or
three
that
come
to
my
mind
at
this
moment
would
reveal
facts
that
no
doubt
to
some
would
seem
almost
incredible
if
not
miraculous
but
let
us
remember
that
what
is
possible
for
one
life
to
realize
is
possible
for
all
this
is
indeed
the
natural
and
the
normal
life
that
which
will
be
the
life
of
every
one
who
comes
into
and
who
lives
in
this
higher
realization
and
so
in
harmony
with
the
higher
laws
this
is
simply
getting
into
the
current
of
that
divine
sequence
running
throughout
the
universe
and
when
once
in
it
life
then
ceases
to
be
a
plodding
and
moves
along
day
after
day
much
as
the
tides
flow
much
as
the
planets
move
in
their
courses
much
as
the
seasons
come
and
go
all
the
frictions
all
the
uncertainties
all
the
ills
the
sufferings
the
fears
the
forebodings
the
perplexities
of
life
come
to
us
because
we
are
out
of
harmony
with
the
divine
order
of
things
they
will
continue
to
come
as
long
as
we
so
live
rowing
against
the
tide
is
hard
and
uncertain
to
go
with
the
tide
and
thus
to
take
advantage
of
the
working
of
a
great
natural
force
is
safe
and
easy
to
come
into
the
conscious
vital
realization
of
our
oneness
with
the
infinite
life
and
power
is
to
come
into
the
current
of
this
divine
sequence
coming
thus
into
harmony
with
the
infinite
brings
us
in
turn
into
harmony
with
all
about
us
into
harmony
with
the
life
of
the
heavens
into
harmony
with
all
the
universe
and
above
all
it
brings
us
into
harmony
with
ourselves
so
that
body
soul
and
mind
become
perfectly
harmonized
and
when
this
is
so
life
becomes
full
and
complete
the
sense
life
then
no
longer
masters
and
enslaves
us
the
physical
is
subordinated
to
and
ruled
by
the
mental
this
in
turn
is
subordinated
to
and
continually
illumined
by
the
spiritual
life
is
then
no
longer
the
poor
thing
it
is
in
so
many
cases
but
the
the
life
with
all
its
beauties
and
ever
increasing
joys
and
powers
is
entered
upon
thus
it
is
that
we
are
brought
to
realize
that
the
middle
path
is
the
great
solution
of
life
neither
asceticism
on
the
one
hand
nor
license
and
perverted
use
on
the
other
everything
is
for
use
but
all
must
be
wisely
used
in
order
to
be
fully
enjoyed
as
we
live
in
these
higher
realizations
the
senses
are
not
ignored
but
are
ever
more
fully
perfected
as
the
body
becomes
less
gross
and
heavy
finer
in
its
texture
and
form
all
the
senses
become
finer
so
that
powers
we
do
not
now
realize
as
belonging
to
us
gradually
develop
thus
we
come
in
a
perfectly
natural
and
normal
way
into
the
realms
whereby
we
make
it
possible
for
the
higher
laws
and
truths
to
be
revealed
to
us
as
we
enter
into
these
realms
we
are
then
not
among
those
who
give
their
time
in
speculating
as
to
whether
this
one
or
that
one
had
the
insight
and
the
powers
attributed
to
him
but
we
are
able
for
ourselves
neither
are
we
among
those
who
attempt
to
lead
the
people
upon
the
hearsay
of
some
one
else
but
we
know
whereof
we
speak
and
only
thus
can
we
speak
with
authority
there
are
many
things
that
we
can
not
know
until
by
living
the
life
we
bring
ourselves
into
that
state
where
it
is
possible
for
them
to
be
revealed
to
us
if
any
man
will
do
his
will
he
shall
know
of
the
doctrine
it
was
plotinus
who
said
the
mind
that
wishes
to
behold
god
must
itself
become
god
as
we
thus
make
it
possible
for
these
higher
laws
and
truths
to
be
revealed
to
us
we
will
in
turn
become
enlightened
ones
channels
through
which
they
may
be
revealed
to
others
when
one
is
fully
alive
to
the
possibilities
that
come
with
this
higher
awakening
as
he
goes
here
and
there
as
he
mingles
with
his
he
imparts
to
all
an
inspiration
that
kindles
in
them
a
feeling
of
power
kindred
to
his
own
we
are
all
continually
giving
out
influences
similar
to
those
that
are
playing
in
our
own
lives
we
do
this
in
the
same
way
that
each
flower
emits
its
own
peculiar
odor
the
rose
breathes
out
its
fragrance
upon
the
air
and
all
who
come
near
it
are
refreshed
and
inspired
by
this
emanation
from
the
soul
of
the
rose
a
poisonous
weed
sends
out
its
obnoxious
odor
it
is
neither
refreshing
nor
inspiring
in
its
effects
and
if
one
remain
near
it
long
he
may
be
so
unpleasantly
affected
as
to
be
made
even
ill
by
it
the
higher
the
life
the
more
inspiring
and
helpful
are
the
emanations
that
it
is
continually
sending
out
the
lower
the
life
the
more
harmful
is
the
influence
it
continually
sends
out
to
all
who
come
in
contact
with
it
each
one
is
continually
radiating
an
atmosphere
of
one
kind
or
the
other
we
are
told
by
the
mariners
who
sail
on
the
indian
seas
that
many
times
they
are
able
to
tell
their
approach
to
certain
islands
long
before
they
can
see
them
by
the
sweet
fragrance
of
the
sandalwood
that
is
wafted
far
out
upon
the
deep
do
you
not
see
how
it
would
serve
to
have
such
a
soul
playing
through
such
a
body
that
as
you
go
here
and
there
a
subtle
silent
force
goes
out
from
you
that
all
feel
and
are
influenced
by
so
that
you
carry
with
you
an
inspiration
and
continually
shed
a
benediction
wherever
you
go
so
that
your
friends
and
all
people
will
say
his
coming
brings
peace
and
joy
into
our
homes
welcome
his
coming
so
that
as
you
pass
along
the
street
tired
and
weary
and
even
men
and
women
will
feel
a
certain
divine
touch
that
will
awaken
new
desires
and
a
new
life
in
them
that
will
make
the
very
horse
as
you
pass
him
turn
his
head
with
a
strange
longing
look
such
are
the
subtle
powers
of
the
human
soul
when
it
makes
itself
translucent
to
the
divine
to
know
that
such
a
life
is
within
our
living
here
and
now
is
enough
to
make
one
burst
forth
with
songs
of
joy
and
when
the
life
itself
is
entered
upon
the
sentiment
of
at
least
one
song
will
be
oh
i
stand
in
the
great
forever
all
things
to
me
are
divine
i
eat
of
the
heavenly
manna
i
drink
of
the
heavenly
wine
in
the
gleam
of
the
shining
rainbow
the
father
love
i
behold
as
i
gaze
on
its
radiant
blending
of
crimson
and
blue
and
gold
in
all
the
bright
birds
that
are
singing
in
all
the
fair
flowers
that
bloom
whose
welcome
aromas
are
bringing
their
blessings
of
sweet
perfume
in
the
glorious
tint
of
the
morning
in
the
gorgeous
sheen
of
the
night
oh
my
soul
is
lost
in
rapture
my
senses
are
lost
in
sight
as
one
comes
into
and
lives
continually
in
the
full
conscious
realization
of
his
oneness
with
the
infinite
life
and
power
then
all
else
follows
this
it
is
that
brings
the
realization
of
such
splendors
and
beauties
and
joys
as
a
life
that
is
thus
related
with
the
infinite
power
alone
can
know
this
it
is
to
come
into
the
realization
of
heaven
richest
treasures
while
walking
the
earth
this
it
is
to
bring
heaven
down
to
earth
or
rather
to
bring
earth
up
to
heaven
this
it
is
to
exchange
weakness
and
impotence
for
strength
sorrows
and
sighings
for
joy
fears
and
forebodings
for
faith
longings
for
realizations
this
it
is
to
come
into
fullness
of
peace
power
and
plenty
this
it
is
to
be
in
tune
with
the
infinite
