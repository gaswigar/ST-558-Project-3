a
narrow
in
the
heart
of
a
bustling
indifferent
city
seen
from
the
windows
of
a
inn
is
at
no
time
an
object
of
enlivening
suggestion
and
the
spectacle
is
not
at
its
best
when
the
mouldy
tombstones
and
funereal
umbrage
have
received
the
ineffectual
refreshment
of
a
dull
moist
if
while
the
air
is
thickened
by
this
frosty
drizzle
the
calendar
should
happen
to
indicate
that
the
blessed
vernal
season
is
already
six
weeks
old
it
will
be
admitted
that
no
depressing
influence
is
absent
from
the
scene
this
fact
was
keenly
felt
on
a
certain
of
may
upwards
of
thirty
years
since
by
a
lady
who
stood
looking
out
of
one
of
the
windows
of
the
best
hotel
in
the
ancient
city
of
boston
she
had
stood
there
for
half
an
hour
stood
there
that
is
at
intervals
for
from
time
to
time
she
turned
back
into
the
room
and
measured
its
length
with
a
restless
step
in
the
was
a
fire
which
emitted
a
small
blue
flame
and
in
front
of
the
fire
at
a
table
sat
a
young
man
who
was
busily
plying
a
pencil
he
had
a
number
of
sheets
of
paper
cut
into
small
equal
squares
and
he
was
apparently
covering
them
with
pictorial
designs
figures
he
worked
rapidly
and
attentively
sometimes
threw
back
his
head
and
held
out
his
drawing
at
arm
and
kept
up
a
soft
humming
and
whistling
the
lady
brushed
past
him
in
her
walk
her
skirts
were
voluminous
she
never
dropped
her
eyes
upon
his
work
she
only
turned
them
occasionally
as
she
passed
to
a
mirror
suspended
above
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
here
she
paused
a
moment
gave
a
pinch
to
her
waist
with
her
two
hands
or
raised
these
members
they
were
very
plump
and
pretty
to
the
multifold
braids
of
her
hair
with
a
movement
half
caressing
half
corrective
an
attentive
observer
might
have
fancied
that
during
these
periods
of
desultory
her
face
forgot
its
melancholy
but
as
soon
as
she
neared
the
window
again
it
began
to
proclaim
that
she
was
a
very
woman
and
indeed
in
what
met
her
eyes
there
was
little
to
be
pleased
with
the
were
battered
by
the
sleet
the
in
the
beneath
seemed
to
be
holding
themselves
askance
to
keep
it
out
of
their
faces
a
tall
iron
railing
protected
them
from
the
street
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
railing
an
assemblage
of
bostonians
were
trampling
about
in
the
liquid
snow
many
of
them
were
looking
up
and
down
they
appeared
to
be
waiting
for
something
from
time
to
time
a
strange
vehicle
drew
near
to
the
place
where
they
stood
such
a
vehicle
as
the
lady
at
the
window
in
spite
of
a
considerable
acquaintance
with
human
inventions
had
never
seen
before
a
huge
low
omnibus
painted
in
brilliant
colors
and
decorated
apparently
with
jangling
bells
attached
to
a
species
of
groove
in
the
pavement
through
which
it
was
dragged
with
a
great
deal
of
rumbling
bouncing
and
scratching
by
a
couple
of
remarkably
small
horses
when
it
reached
a
certain
point
the
people
in
front
of
the
of
whom
much
the
greater
number
were
women
carrying
satchels
and
parcels
projected
themselves
upon
it
in
a
compact
body
a
movement
suggesting
the
scramble
for
places
in
a
at
sea
and
were
engulfed
in
its
large
interior
then
the
or
the
as
the
lady
at
the
window
of
the
hotel
vaguely
designated
it
went
bumping
and
jingling
away
upon
its
invisible
wheels
with
the
helmsman
the
man
at
the
wheel
guiding
its
course
incongruously
from
the
prow
this
phenomenon
was
repeated
every
three
minutes
and
the
supply
of
women
in
cloaks
bearing
reticules
and
bundles
renewed
itself
in
the
most
liberal
manner
on
the
other
side
of
the
was
a
row
of
small
red
brick
houses
showing
a
series
of
homely
backs
at
the
end
opposite
the
hotel
a
tall
wooden
painted
white
rose
high
into
the
vagueness
of
the
the
lady
at
the
window
looked
at
it
for
some
time
for
reasons
of
her
own
she
thought
it
the
ugliest
thing
she
had
ever
seen
she
hated
it
she
despised
it
it
threw
her
into
a
state
of
irritation
that
was
quite
out
of
proportion
to
any
sensible
motive
she
had
never
known
herself
to
care
so
much
about
she
was
not
pretty
but
even
when
it
expressed
perplexed
irritation
her
face
was
most
interesting
and
agreeable
neither
was
she
in
her
first
youth
yet
though
slender
with
a
great
deal
of
extremely
roundness
of
contour
a
suggestion
both
of
maturity
and
flexibility
she
carried
her
three
and
thirty
years
as
a
hebe
might
have
carried
a
brimming
her
complexion
was
fatigued
as
the
french
say
her
mouth
was
large
her
lips
too
full
her
teeth
uneven
her
chin
rather
commonly
modeled
she
had
a
thick
nose
and
when
she
smiled
she
was
constantly
smiling
the
lines
beside
it
rose
too
high
toward
her
eyes
but
these
eyes
were
charming
gray
in
color
brilliant
quickly
glancing
gently
resting
full
of
intelligence
her
forehead
was
very
low
it
was
her
only
handsome
feature
and
she
had
a
great
abundance
of
crisp
dark
hair
finely
frizzled
which
was
always
braided
in
a
manner
that
suggested
some
southern
or
eastern
some
remotely
foreign
woman
she
had
a
large
collection
of
and
wore
them
in
alternation
and
they
seemed
to
give
a
point
to
her
oriental
or
exotic
aspect
a
compliment
had
once
been
paid
her
which
being
repeated
to
her
gave
her
greater
pleasure
than
anything
she
had
ever
heard
a
pretty
woman
someone
had
said
why
her
features
are
very
i
don
t
know
about
her
features
a
very
discerning
observer
had
answered
but
she
carries
her
head
like
a
pretty
you
may
imagine
whether
after
this
she
carried
her
head
less
becomingly
she
turned
away
from
the
window
at
last
pressing
her
hands
to
her
eyes
it
s
too
horrible
she
exclaimed
i
shall
go
back
i
shall
go
back
and
she
flung
herself
into
a
chair
before
the
fire
wait
a
little
dear
child
said
the
young
man
softly
sketching
away
at
his
little
scraps
of
paper
the
lady
put
out
her
foot
it
was
very
small
and
there
was
an
immense
rosette
on
her
slipper
she
fixed
her
eyes
for
a
while
on
this
ornament
and
then
she
looked
at
the
glowing
bed
of
anthracite
coal
in
the
grate
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
hideous
as
that
fire
she
demanded
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
so
as
as
everything
she
spoke
english
with
perfect
purity
but
she
brought
out
this
french
epithet
in
a
manner
that
indicated
that
she
was
accustomed
to
using
french
epithets
i
think
the
fire
is
very
pretty
said
the
young
man
glancing
at
it
a
moment
those
little
blue
tongues
dancing
on
top
of
the
crimson
embers
are
extremely
picturesque
they
are
like
a
fire
in
an
alchemist
s
you
are
too
my
dear
his
companion
declared
the
young
man
held
out
one
of
his
drawings
with
his
head
on
one
side
his
tongue
was
gently
moving
along
his
yes
too
you
are
irritating
said
the
lady
looking
at
her
slipper
he
began
to
retouch
his
sketch
i
think
you
mean
simply
that
you
are
ah
for
that
yes
said
his
companion
with
a
little
bitter
laugh
it
s
the
darkest
day
of
my
life
and
you
know
what
that
wait
till
tomorrow
rejoined
the
young
man
yes
we
have
made
a
great
mistake
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
it
today
there
certainly
will
be
none
tomorrow
sera
clair
au
moins
the
young
man
was
silent
a
few
moments
driving
his
pencil
then
at
last
there
are
no
such
things
as
mistakes
he
affirmed
very
true
for
those
who
are
not
clever
enough
to
perceive
them
not
to
recognize
one
s
mistakes
that
would
be
happiness
in
life
the
lady
went
on
still
looking
at
her
pretty
foot
my
dearest
sister
said
the
young
man
always
intent
upon
his
drawing
it
s
the
first
time
you
have
told
me
i
am
not
well
by
your
own
theory
i
can
t
call
it
a
mistake
answered
his
sister
pertinently
enough
the
young
man
gave
a
clear
fresh
laugh
you
at
least
are
clever
enough
dearest
sister
he
said
i
was
not
so
when
i
proposed
was
it
you
who
proposed
it
asked
her
brother
she
turned
her
head
and
gave
him
a
little
stare
do
you
desire
the
credit
of
it
if
you
like
i
will
take
the
blame
he
said
looking
up
with
a
smile
yes
she
rejoined
in
a
moment
you
make
no
difference
in
these
things
you
have
no
sense
of
the
young
man
gave
his
joyous
laugh
again
if
that
means
i
have
no
property
you
are
right
don
t
joke
about
your
poverty
said
his
sister
that
is
quite
as
vulgar
as
to
boast
about
my
poverty
i
have
just
finished
a
drawing
that
will
bring
me
fifty
francs
voyons
said
the
lady
putting
out
her
hand
he
added
a
touch
or
two
and
then
gave
her
his
sketch
she
looked
at
it
but
she
went
on
with
her
idea
of
a
moment
before
if
a
woman
were
to
ask
you
to
marry
her
you
would
say
certainly
my
dear
with
pleasure
and
you
would
marry
her
and
be
ridiculously
happy
then
at
the
end
of
three
months
you
would
say
to
her
you
know
that
blissful
day
when
i
begged
you
to
be
mine
the
young
man
had
risen
from
the
table
stretching
his
arms
a
little
he
walked
to
the
window
that
is
a
description
of
a
charming
nature
he
said
oh
yes
you
have
a
charming
nature
i
regard
that
as
our
capital
if
i
had
not
been
convinced
of
that
i
should
never
have
taken
the
risk
of
bringing
you
to
this
dreadful
this
comical
country
this
delightful
country
exclaimed
the
young
man
and
he
broke
into
the
most
animated
laughter
is
it
those
women
scrambling
into
the
omnibus
asked
his
companion
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
attraction
i
suppose
there
is
a
very
man
inside
said
the
young
man
in
each
of
them
they
come
along
in
hundreds
and
the
men
in
this
country
don
t
seem
at
all
handsome
as
for
the
women
i
have
never
seen
so
many
at
once
since
i
left
the
the
women
are
very
pretty
her
brother
declared
and
the
whole
affair
is
very
amusing
i
must
make
a
sketch
of
and
he
came
back
to
the
table
quickly
and
picked
up
his
utensils
a
small
a
sheet
of
paper
and
three
or
four
crayons
he
took
his
place
at
the
window
with
these
things
and
stood
there
glancing
out
plying
his
pencil
with
an
air
of
easy
skill
while
he
worked
he
wore
a
brilliant
smile
brilliant
is
indeed
the
word
at
this
moment
for
his
face
he
was
eight
and
twenty
years
old
he
had
a
short
slight
figure
though
he
bore
a
noticeable
resemblance
to
his
sister
he
was
a
better
favored
person
with
a
delicate
finish
of
feature
and
an
expression
at
once
urbane
and
not
at
all
serious
a
warm
blue
eye
an
eyebrow
finely
drawn
and
excessively
arched
an
eyebrow
which
if
ladies
wrote
sonnets
to
those
of
their
lovers
might
have
been
made
the
subject
of
such
a
piece
of
verse
and
a
light
moustache
that
flourished
upwards
as
if
blown
that
way
by
the
breath
of
a
constant
smile
there
was
something
in
his
physiognomy
at
once
benevolent
and
picturesque
but
as
i
have
hinted
it
was
not
at
all
serious
the
young
man
s
face
was
in
this
respect
singular
it
was
not
at
all
serious
and
yet
it
inspired
the
liveliest
confidence
be
sure
you
put
in
plenty
of
snow
said
his
sister
what
a
climate
i
shall
leave
the
sketch
all
white
and
i
shall
put
in
the
little
figures
in
black
the
young
man
answered
laughing
and
i
shall
call
it
what
is
that
line
in
keats
s
eldest
child
i
don
t
remember
said
the
lady
that
mamma
ever
told
me
it
was
like
mamma
never
told
you
anything
disagreeable
and
it
s
not
like
this
every
day
you
will
see
that
tomorrow
we
shall
have
a
splendid
en
tomorrow
i
shall
go
where
shall
you
go
anywhere
away
from
here
back
to
silberstadt
i
shall
write
to
the
reigning
the
young
man
turned
a
little
and
looked
at
her
with
his
crayon
poised
my
dear
eugenia
he
murmured
were
you
so
happy
at
sea
eugenia
got
up
she
still
held
in
her
hand
the
drawing
her
brother
had
given
her
it
was
a
bold
expressive
sketch
of
a
group
of
miserable
people
on
the
deck
of
a
steamer
clinging
together
and
clutching
at
each
other
while
the
vessel
lurched
downward
at
a
terrific
angle
into
the
hollow
of
a
wave
it
was
extremely
clever
and
full
of
a
sort
of
power
eugenia
dropped
her
eyes
upon
it
and
made
a
sad
grimace
how
can
you
draw
such
odious
scenes
she
asked
i
should
like
to
throw
it
into
the
fire
and
she
tossed
the
paper
away
her
brother
watched
quietly
to
see
where
it
went
it
fluttered
down
to
the
floor
where
he
let
it
lie
she
came
toward
the
window
pinching
in
her
waist
why
don
t
you
reproach
me
abuse
me
she
asked
i
think
i
should
feel
better
then
why
don
t
you
tell
me
that
you
hate
me
for
bringing
you
here
because
you
would
not
believe
it
i
adore
you
dear
sister
i
am
delighted
to
be
here
and
i
am
charmed
with
the
i
don
t
know
what
had
taken
possession
of
me
i
had
lost
my
head
eugenia
went
on
the
young
man
on
his
side
went
on
plying
his
pencil
it
is
evidently
a
most
curious
and
interesting
country
here
we
are
and
i
mean
to
enjoy
his
companion
turned
away
with
an
impatient
step
but
presently
came
back
high
spirits
are
doubtless
an
excellent
thing
she
said
but
you
give
one
too
much
of
them
and
i
can
t
see
that
they
have
done
you
any
the
young
man
stared
with
lifted
eyebrows
smiling
he
tapped
his
handsome
nose
with
his
pencil
they
have
made
me
happy
that
was
the
least
they
could
do
they
have
made
you
nothing
else
you
have
gone
through
life
thanking
fortune
for
such
very
small
favors
that
she
has
never
put
herself
to
any
trouble
for
she
must
have
put
herself
to
a
little
i
think
to
present
me
with
so
admirable
a
be
serious
felix
you
forget
that
i
am
your
with
a
sister
then
so
elderly
rejoined
felix
laughing
i
hoped
we
had
left
seriousness
in
i
fancy
you
will
find
it
here
remember
that
you
are
nearly
thirty
years
old
and
that
you
are
nothing
but
an
obscure
bohemian
a
penniless
correspondent
of
an
illustrated
obscure
as
much
as
you
please
but
not
so
much
of
a
bohemian
as
you
think
and
not
at
all
penniless
i
have
a
hundred
pounds
in
my
pocket
i
have
an
engagement
to
make
fifty
sketches
and
i
mean
to
paint
the
portraits
of
all
our
cousins
and
of
all
cousins
at
a
hundred
dollars
a
you
are
not
ambitious
said
eugenia
you
are
dear
baroness
the
young
man
replied
the
baroness
was
silent
a
moment
looking
out
at
the
and
the
bumping
yes
i
am
ambitious
she
said
at
last
and
my
ambition
has
brought
me
to
this
dreadful
place
she
glanced
about
her
the
room
had
a
certain
vulgar
nudity
the
bed
and
the
window
were
curtainless
and
she
gave
a
little
passionate
sigh
poor
old
ambition
she
exclaimed
then
she
flung
herself
down
upon
a
sofa
which
stood
near
against
the
wall
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
her
brother
went
on
with
his
drawing
rapidly
and
skillfully
after
some
moments
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
showed
her
his
sketch
now
don
t
you
think
that
s
pretty
good
for
an
obscure
bohemian
he
asked
i
have
knocked
off
another
fifty
eugenia
glanced
at
the
little
picture
as
he
laid
it
on
her
lap
yes
it
is
very
clever
she
said
and
in
a
moment
she
added
do
you
suppose
our
cousins
do
that
do
what
get
into
those
things
and
look
like
felix
meditated
awhile
i
really
can
t
say
it
will
be
interesting
to
oh
the
rich
people
can
t
said
the
baroness
are
you
very
sure
they
are
rich
asked
felix
lightly
his
sister
slowly
turned
in
her
place
looking
at
him
heavenly
powers
she
murmured
you
have
a
way
of
bringing
out
things
it
will
certainly
be
much
pleasanter
if
they
are
rich
felix
declared
do
you
suppose
if
i
had
not
known
they
were
rich
i
would
ever
have
come
the
young
man
met
his
sister
s
somewhat
peremptory
eye
with
his
bright
contented
glance
yes
it
certainly
will
be
pleasanter
he
repeated
that
is
all
i
expect
of
them
said
the
baroness
i
don
t
count
upon
their
being
clever
or
friendly
at
first
or
elegant
or
interesting
but
i
assure
you
i
insist
upon
their
being
felix
leaned
his
head
upon
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
looked
awhile
at
the
oblong
patch
of
sky
to
which
the
window
served
as
frame
the
snow
was
ceasing
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
sky
had
begun
to
brighten
i
count
upon
their
being
rich
he
said
at
last
and
powerful
and
clever
and
friendly
and
elegant
and
interesting
and
generally
delightful
vas
and
he
bent
forward
and
kissed
his
sister
look
there
he
went
on
as
a
portent
even
while
i
speak
the
sky
is
turning
the
color
of
gold
the
day
is
going
to
be
and
indeed
within
five
minutes
the
weather
had
changed
the
sun
broke
out
through
the
and
jumped
into
the
baroness
s
room
exclaimed
this
lady
what
a
climate
we
will
go
out
and
see
the
world
said
felix
and
after
a
while
they
went
out
the
air
had
grown
warm
as
well
as
brilliant
the
sunshine
had
dried
the
pavements
they
walked
about
the
streets
at
hazard
looking
at
the
people
and
the
houses
the
shops
and
the
vehicles
the
blazing
blue
sky
and
the
muddy
crossings
the
hurrying
men
and
the
maidens
the
fresh
red
bricks
and
the
bright
green
trees
the
extraordinary
mixture
of
smartness
and
shabbiness
from
one
hour
to
another
the
day
had
grown
vernal
even
in
the
bustling
streets
there
was
an
odor
of
earth
and
blossom
felix
was
immensely
entertained
he
had
called
it
a
comical
country
and
he
went
about
laughing
at
everything
he
saw
you
would
have
said
that
american
civilization
expressed
itself
to
his
sense
in
a
tissue
of
capital
jokes
the
jokes
were
certainly
excellent
and
the
young
man
s
merriment
was
joyous
and
genial
he
possessed
what
is
called
the
pictorial
sense
and
this
first
glimpse
of
democratic
manners
stirred
the
same
sort
of
attention
that
he
would
have
given
to
the
movements
of
a
lively
young
person
with
a
bright
complexion
such
attention
would
have
been
demonstrative
and
complimentary
and
in
the
present
case
felix
might
have
passed
for
an
undispirited
young
exile
revisiting
the
haunts
of
his
childhood
he
kept
looking
at
the
violent
blue
of
the
sky
at
the
scintillating
air
at
the
scattered
and
multiplied
patches
of
color
c
est
eh
he
said
to
his
sister
in
that
foreign
tongue
which
they
both
appeared
to
feel
a
mysterious
prompting
occasionally
to
use
yes
it
is
indeed
the
baroness
answered
i
don
t
like
the
coloring
it
hurts
my
it
shows
how
extremes
meet
the
young
man
rejoined
instead
of
coming
to
the
west
we
seem
to
have
gone
to
the
east
the
way
the
sky
touches
the
is
just
like
cairo
and
the
red
and
blue
patched
over
the
face
of
everything
remind
one
of
mahometan
the
young
women
are
not
mahometan
said
his
companion
they
can
t
be
said
to
hide
their
faces
i
never
saw
anything
so
thank
heaven
they
don
t
hide
their
faces
cried
felix
their
faces
are
uncommonly
yes
their
faces
are
often
very
pretty
said
the
baroness
who
was
a
very
clever
woman
she
was
too
clever
a
woman
not
to
be
capable
of
a
great
deal
of
just
and
fine
observation
she
clung
more
closely
than
usual
to
her
brother
s
arm
she
was
not
exhilarated
as
he
was
she
said
very
little
but
she
noted
a
great
many
things
and
made
her
reflections
she
was
a
little
excited
she
felt
that
she
had
indeed
come
to
a
strange
country
to
make
her
fortune
superficially
she
was
conscious
of
a
good
deal
of
irritation
and
displeasure
the
baroness
was
a
very
delicate
and
fastidious
person
of
old
more
than
once
she
had
gone
for
entertainment
s
sake
and
in
brilliant
company
to
a
fair
in
a
provincial
town
it
seemed
to
her
now
that
she
was
at
an
enormous
fair
that
the
entertainment
and
the
were
very
much
the
same
she
found
herself
alternately
smiling
and
shrinking
the
show
was
very
curious
but
it
was
probable
from
moment
to
moment
that
one
would
be
jostled
the
baroness
had
never
seen
so
many
people
walking
about
before
she
had
never
been
so
mixed
up
with
people
she
did
not
know
but
little
by
little
she
felt
that
this
fair
was
a
more
serious
undertaking
she
went
with
her
brother
into
a
large
public
garden
which
seemed
very
pretty
but
where
she
was
surprised
at
seeing
no
carriages
the
afternoon
was
drawing
to
a
close
the
coarse
vivid
grass
and
the
slender
were
gilded
by
the
level
sunbeams
gilded
as
with
gold
that
was
fresh
from
the
mine
it
was
the
hour
at
which
ladies
should
come
out
for
an
airing
and
roll
past
a
hedge
of
pedestrians
holding
their
parasols
askance
here
however
eugenia
observed
no
indications
of
this
custom
the
absence
of
which
was
more
anomalous
as
there
was
a
charming
avenue
of
remarkably
graceful
arching
elms
in
the
most
convenient
contiguity
to
a
large
cheerful
street
in
which
evidently
among
the
more
prosperous
members
of
the
a
great
deal
of
pedestrianism
went
forward
our
friends
passed
out
into
this
well
lighted
promenade
and
felix
noticed
a
great
many
more
pretty
girls
and
called
his
sister
s
attention
to
them
this
latter
measure
however
was
superfluous
for
the
baroness
had
inspected
narrowly
these
charming
young
ladies
i
feel
an
intimate
conviction
that
our
cousins
are
like
that
said
felix
the
baroness
hoped
so
but
this
is
not
what
she
said
they
are
very
pretty
she
said
but
they
are
mere
little
girls
where
are
the
women
the
women
of
thirty
of
do
you
mean
her
brother
was
going
to
ask
for
he
understood
often
both
what
she
said
and
what
she
did
not
say
but
he
only
exclaimed
upon
the
beauty
of
the
sunset
while
the
baroness
who
had
come
to
seek
her
fortune
reflected
that
it
would
certainly
be
well
for
her
if
the
persons
against
whom
she
might
need
to
measure
herself
should
all
be
mere
little
girls
the
sunset
was
superb
they
stopped
to
look
at
it
felix
declared
that
he
had
never
seen
such
a
gorgeous
mixture
of
colors
the
baroness
also
thought
it
splendid
and
she
was
perhaps
the
more
easily
pleased
from
the
fact
that
while
she
stood
there
she
was
conscious
of
much
admiring
observation
on
the
part
of
various
people
who
passed
that
way
and
to
whom
a
distinguished
woman
with
a
foreign
air
exclaiming
upon
the
beauties
of
nature
on
a
boston
street
corner
in
the
french
tongue
could
not
be
an
object
of
indifference
eugenia
s
spirits
rose
she
surrendered
herself
to
a
certain
tranquil
gaiety
if
she
had
come
to
seek
her
fortune
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
fortune
would
be
easy
to
find
there
was
a
promise
of
it
in
the
gorgeous
purity
of
the
western
sky
there
was
an
intimation
in
the
mild
unimpertinent
gaze
of
the
passers
of
a
certain
natural
facility
in
things
you
will
not
go
back
to
silberstadt
eh
asked
felix
not
tomorrow
said
the
baroness
nor
write
to
the
reigning
prince
i
shall
write
to
him
that
they
evidently
know
nothing
about
him
over
he
will
not
believe
you
said
the
young
man
i
advise
you
to
let
him
felix
himself
continued
to
be
in
high
good
humor
brought
up
among
ancient
customs
and
in
picturesque
cities
he
yet
found
plenty
of
local
color
in
the
little
puritan
metropolis
that
evening
after
dinner
he
told
his
sister
that
he
should
go
forth
early
on
the
morrow
to
look
up
their
cousins
you
are
very
impatient
said
eugenia
what
can
be
more
natural
he
asked
after
seeing
all
those
pretty
girls
today
if
one
s
cousins
are
of
that
pattern
the
sooner
one
knows
them
the
perhaps
they
are
not
said
eugenia
we
ought
to
have
brought
some
letters
to
some
other
the
other
people
would
not
be
our
possibly
they
would
be
none
the
worse
for
that
the
baroness
replied
her
brother
looked
at
her
with
his
eyebrows
lifted
that
was
not
what
you
said
when
you
first
proposed
to
me
that
we
should
come
out
here
and
fraternize
with
our
relatives
you
said
that
it
was
the
prompting
of
natural
affection
and
when
i
suggested
some
reasons
against
it
you
declared
that
the
du
should
go
before
you
remember
all
that
asked
the
baroness
vividly
i
was
greatly
moved
by
she
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
as
she
had
done
in
the
morning
she
stopped
in
her
walk
and
looked
at
her
brother
she
apparently
was
going
to
say
something
but
she
checked
herself
and
resumed
her
walk
then
in
a
few
moments
she
said
something
different
which
had
the
effect
of
an
explanation
of
the
suppression
of
her
earlier
thought
you
will
never
be
anything
but
a
child
dear
one
would
suppose
that
you
madam
answered
felix
laughing
were
a
thousand
years
i
am
sometimes
said
the
baroness
i
will
go
then
and
announce
to
our
cousins
the
arrival
of
a
personage
so
extraordinary
they
will
immediately
come
and
pay
you
their
eugenia
paced
the
length
of
the
room
again
and
then
she
stopped
before
her
brother
laying
her
hand
upon
his
arm
they
are
not
to
come
and
see
me
she
said
you
are
not
to
allow
that
that
is
not
the
way
i
shall
meet
them
and
in
answer
to
his
interrogative
glance
she
went
on
you
will
go
and
examine
and
report
you
will
come
back
and
tell
me
who
they
are
and
what
they
are
their
number
gender
their
respective
ages
all
about
them
be
sure
you
observe
everything
be
ready
to
describe
to
me
the
locality
the
accessories
how
shall
i
say
it
the
en
then
at
my
own
time
at
my
own
hour
under
circumstances
of
my
own
choosing
i
will
go
to
them
i
will
present
myself
i
will
appear
before
them
said
the
baroness
this
time
phrasing
her
idea
with
a
certain
frankness
and
what
message
am
i
to
take
to
them
asked
felix
who
had
a
lively
faith
in
the
justness
of
his
sister
s
arrangements
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
at
his
expression
of
agreeable
veracity
and
with
that
justness
that
he
admired
she
replied
say
what
you
please
tell
my
story
in
the
way
that
seems
to
you
most
and
she
bent
her
forehead
for
him
to
kiss
chapter
ii
the
next
day
was
splendid
as
felix
had
prophesied
if
the
winter
had
suddenly
leaped
into
spring
the
spring
had
for
the
moment
as
quickly
leaped
into
summer
this
was
an
observation
made
by
a
young
girl
who
came
out
of
a
large
square
house
in
the
country
and
strolled
about
in
the
spacious
garden
which
separated
it
from
a
muddy
road
the
flowering
shrubs
and
the
plants
were
basking
in
the
abundant
light
and
warmth
the
transparent
shade
of
the
great
elms
they
were
magnificent
trees
seemed
to
thicken
by
the
hour
and
the
intensely
habitual
stillness
offered
a
submissive
medium
to
the
sound
of
a
distant
the
young
girl
listened
to
the
but
she
was
not
dressed
for
church
she
was
she
wore
a
white
muslin
waist
with
an
embroidered
border
and
the
skirt
of
her
dress
was
of
colored
muslin
she
was
a
young
lady
of
some
two
or
three
and
twenty
years
of
age
and
though
a
young
person
of
her
sex
walking
in
a
garden
of
a
sunday
morning
in
can
in
the
nature
of
things
never
be
a
displeasing
object
you
would
not
have
pronounced
this
innocent
especially
pretty
she
was
tall
and
pale
thin
and
a
little
awkward
her
hair
was
fair
and
perfectly
straight
her
eyes
were
dark
and
they
had
the
singularity
of
seeming
at
once
dull
and
restless
differing
herein
as
you
see
fatally
from
the
ideal
fine
eyes
which
we
always
imagine
to
be
both
brilliant
and
tranquil
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
large
square
house
were
all
wide
open
to
admit
the
purifying
sunshine
which
lay
in
generous
patches
upon
the
floor
of
a
wide
high
covered
piazza
adjusted
to
two
sides
of
the
mansion
a
piazza
on
which
several
and
half
a
dozen
of
those
small
cylindrical
stools
in
green
and
blue
porcelain
which
suggest
an
affiliation
between
the
residents
and
the
eastern
trade
were
symmetrically
disposed
it
was
an
ancient
house
ancient
in
the
sense
of
being
eighty
years
old
it
was
built
of
wood
painted
a
clean
clear
faded
gray
and
adorned
along
the
front
at
intervals
with
flat
wooden
pilasters
painted
white
these
pilasters
appeared
to
support
a
kind
of
classic
pediment
which
was
decorated
in
the
middle
by
a
large
triple
window
in
a
boldly
carved
frame
and
in
each
of
its
smaller
angles
by
a
glazed
circular
aperture
a
large
white
door
furnished
with
a
brass
knocker
presented
itself
to
the
road
with
which
it
was
connected
by
a
spacious
pathway
paved
with
worn
and
cracked
but
very
clean
bricks
behind
it
there
were
meadows
and
orchards
a
barn
and
a
pond
and
facing
it
a
short
distance
along
the
road
on
the
opposite
side
stood
a
smaller
house
painted
white
with
external
shutters
painted
green
a
little
garden
on
one
hand
and
an
orchard
on
the
other
all
this
was
shining
in
the
morning
air
through
which
the
simple
details
of
the
picture
addressed
themselves
to
the
eye
as
distinctly
as
the
items
of
a
sum
in
addition
a
second
young
lady
presently
came
out
of
the
house
across
the
piazza
descended
into
the
garden
and
approached
the
young
girl
of
whom
i
have
spoken
this
second
young
lady
was
also
thin
and
pale
but
she
was
older
than
the
other
she
was
shorter
she
had
dark
smooth
hair
her
eyes
unlike
the
other
s
were
quick
and
bright
but
they
were
not
at
all
restless
she
wore
a
straw
bonnet
with
white
ribbons
and
a
long
red
india
scarf
which
on
the
front
of
her
dress
reached
to
her
feet
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
little
key
gertrude
she
said
are
you
very
sure
you
had
better
not
go
to
church
gertrude
looked
at
her
a
moment
plucked
a
small
sprig
from
a
smelled
it
and
threw
it
away
i
am
not
very
sure
of
anything
she
answered
the
other
young
lady
looked
straight
past
her
at
the
distant
pond
which
lay
shining
between
the
long
banks
of
fir
trees
then
she
said
in
a
very
soft
voice
this
is
the
key
of
the
closet
i
think
you
had
better
have
it
if
anyone
should
want
who
is
there
to
want
anything
gertrude
demanded
i
shall
be
all
alone
in
the
someone
may
come
said
her
companion
do
you
mean
mr
brand
yes
gertrude
he
may
like
a
piece
of
i
don
t
like
men
that
are
always
eating
cake
gertrude
declared
giving
a
pull
at
the
her
companion
glanced
at
her
and
then
looked
down
on
the
ground
i
think
father
expected
you
would
come
to
church
she
said
what
shall
i
say
to
him
say
i
have
a
bad
would
that
be
true
asked
the
elder
lady
looking
straight
at
the
pond
again
no
charlotte
said
the
younger
one
simply
charlotte
transferred
her
quiet
eyes
to
her
companion
s
face
i
am
afraid
you
are
feeling
i
am
feeling
as
i
always
feel
gertrude
replied
in
the
same
tone
charlotte
turned
away
but
she
stood
there
a
moment
presently
she
looked
down
at
the
front
of
her
dress
doesn
t
it
seem
to
you
somehow
as
if
my
scarf
were
too
long
she
asked
gertrude
walked
half
round
her
looking
at
the
scarf
i
don
t
think
you
wear
it
right
she
said
how
should
i
wear
it
dear
i
don
t
know
differently
from
that
you
should
draw
it
differently
over
your
shoulders
round
your
elbows
you
should
look
differently
how
should
i
look
charlotte
inquired
i
don
t
think
i
can
tell
you
said
gertrude
plucking
out
the
scarf
a
little
behind
i
could
do
it
myself
but
i
don
t
think
i
can
explain
charlotte
by
a
movement
of
her
elbows
corrected
the
laxity
that
had
come
from
her
companion
s
touch
well
some
day
you
must
do
it
for
me
it
doesn
t
matter
now
indeed
i
don
t
think
it
matters
she
added
how
one
looks
i
should
say
it
mattered
more
said
gertrude
then
you
don
t
know
who
may
be
observing
you
you
are
not
on
your
guard
you
can
t
try
to
look
charlotte
received
this
declaration
with
extreme
gravity
i
don
t
think
one
should
ever
try
to
look
pretty
she
rejoined
earnestly
her
companion
was
silent
then
she
said
well
perhaps
it
s
not
of
much
charlotte
looked
at
her
a
little
and
then
kissed
her
i
hope
you
will
be
better
when
we
come
my
dear
sister
i
am
very
well
said
gertrude
charlotte
went
down
the
large
brick
walk
to
the
garden
gate
her
companion
strolled
slowly
toward
the
house
at
the
gate
charlotte
met
a
young
man
who
was
coming
in
a
tall
fair
young
man
wearing
a
high
hat
and
a
pair
of
thread
gloves
he
was
handsome
but
rather
too
stout
he
had
a
pleasant
smile
oh
mr
brand
exclaimed
the
young
lady
i
came
to
see
whether
your
sister
was
not
going
to
church
said
the
young
man
she
says
she
is
not
going
but
i
am
very
glad
you
have
come
i
think
if
you
were
to
talk
to
her
a
little
and
charlotte
lowered
her
voice
it
seems
as
if
she
were
mr
brand
smiled
down
on
the
young
lady
from
his
great
height
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
talk
to
her
for
that
i
should
be
willing
to
absent
myself
from
almost
any
occasion
of
worship
however
well
i
suppose
you
know
said
charlotte
softly
as
if
positive
acceptance
of
this
proposition
might
be
dangerous
but
i
am
afraid
i
shall
be
i
hope
you
will
have
a
pleasant
sermon
said
the
young
man
oh
gilman
is
always
pleasant
charlotte
answered
and
she
went
on
her
way
mr
brand
went
into
the
garden
where
gertrude
hearing
the
gate
close
behind
him
turned
and
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
she
watched
him
coming
then
she
turned
away
but
almost
immediately
she
corrected
this
movement
and
stood
still
facing
him
he
took
off
his
hat
and
wiped
his
forehead
as
he
approached
then
he
put
on
his
hat
again
and
held
out
his
hand
his
hat
being
removed
you
would
have
perceived
that
his
forehead
was
very
large
and
smooth
and
his
hair
abundant
but
rather
colorless
his
nose
was
too
large
and
his
mouth
and
eyes
were
too
small
but
for
all
this
he
was
as
i
have
said
a
young
man
of
striking
appearance
the
expression
of
his
little
blue
eyes
was
irresistibly
gentle
and
serious
he
looked
as
the
phrase
is
as
good
as
gold
the
young
girl
standing
in
the
garden
path
glanced
as
he
came
up
at
his
thread
gloves
i
hoped
you
were
going
to
church
he
said
i
wanted
to
walk
with
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
gertrude
answered
i
am
not
going
to
she
had
shaken
hands
with
him
he
held
her
hand
a
moment
have
you
any
special
reason
for
not
going
yes
brand
said
the
young
girl
may
i
ask
what
it
is
she
looked
at
him
smiling
and
in
her
smile
as
i
have
intimated
there
was
a
certain
dullness
but
mingled
with
this
dullness
was
something
sweet
and
suggestive
because
the
sky
is
so
blue
she
said
he
looked
at
the
sky
which
was
magnificent
and
then
said
smiling
too
i
have
heard
of
young
ladies
staying
at
home
for
bad
weather
but
never
for
good
your
sister
whom
i
met
at
the
gate
tells
me
you
are
depressed
he
added
depressed
i
am
never
oh
surely
sometimes
replied
mr
brand
as
if
he
thought
this
a
regrettable
account
of
one
s
self
i
am
never
depressed
gertrude
repeated
but
i
am
sometimes
wicked
when
i
am
wicked
i
am
in
high
spirits
i
was
wicked
just
now
to
my
what
did
you
do
to
her
i
said
things
that
puzzled
her
on
why
did
you
do
that
miss
gertrude
asked
the
young
man
she
began
to
smile
again
because
the
sky
is
so
blue
you
say
things
that
puzzle
mr
brand
declared
i
always
know
when
i
do
it
proceeded
gertrude
but
people
puzzle
me
more
i
think
and
they
don
t
seem
to
know
this
is
very
interesting
mr
brand
observed
smiling
you
told
me
to
tell
you
about
my
my
struggles
the
young
girl
went
on
let
us
talk
about
them
i
have
so
many
things
to
gertrude
turned
away
a
moment
and
then
turning
back
you
had
better
go
to
church
she
said
you
know
the
young
man
urged
that
i
have
always
one
thing
to
gertrude
looked
at
him
a
moment
please
don
t
say
it
now
we
are
all
alone
he
continued
taking
off
his
hat
all
alone
in
this
beautiful
sunday
gertrude
looked
around
her
at
the
breaking
buds
the
shining
distance
the
blue
sky
to
which
she
had
referred
as
a
pretext
for
her
irregularities
that
s
the
reason
she
said
why
i
don
t
want
you
to
speak
do
me
a
favor
go
to
may
i
speak
when
i
come
back
asked
mr
brand
if
you
are
still
disposed
she
answered
i
don
t
know
whether
you
are
wicked
he
said
but
you
are
certainly
she
had
turned
away
she
raised
her
hands
to
her
ears
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
then
he
slowly
walked
to
church
she
wandered
for
a
while
about
the
garden
vaguely
and
without
purpose
the
had
stopped
ringing
the
stillness
was
complete
this
young
lady
relished
highly
on
occasions
the
sense
of
being
alone
the
absence
of
the
whole
family
and
the
emptiness
of
the
house
today
apparently
the
servants
had
also
gone
to
church
there
was
never
a
figure
at
the
open
windows
behind
the
house
there
was
no
stout
negress
in
a
red
turban
lowering
the
bucket
into
the
great
well
and
the
front
door
of
the
big
unguarded
home
stood
open
with
the
trustfulness
of
the
golden
age
or
what
is
more
to
the
purpose
with
that
of
new
england
s
silvery
prime
gertrude
slowly
passed
through
it
and
went
from
one
of
the
empty
rooms
to
the
other
large
rooms
with
white
wainscots
ornamented
with
mahogany
furniture
and
on
the
walls
with
engravings
chiefly
of
scriptural
subjects
hung
very
high
this
agreeable
sense
of
solitude
of
having
the
house
to
herself
of
which
i
have
spoken
always
excited
gertrude
s
imagination
she
could
not
have
told
you
why
and
neither
can
her
humble
historian
it
always
seemed
to
her
that
she
must
do
something
particular
that
she
must
honor
the
occasion
and
while
she
roamed
about
wondering
what
she
could
do
the
occasion
usually
came
to
an
end
today
she
wondered
more
than
ever
at
last
she
took
down
a
book
there
was
no
library
in
the
house
but
there
were
books
in
all
the
rooms
none
of
them
were
forbidden
books
and
gertrude
had
not
stopped
at
home
for
the
sake
of
a
chance
to
climb
to
the
inaccessible
shelves
she
possessed
herself
of
a
very
obvious
volume
one
of
the
series
of
the
and
she
brought
it
out
into
the
portico
and
sat
down
with
it
in
her
lap
there
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
read
the
history
of
the
loves
of
the
prince
camaralzaman
and
the
princess
badoura
at
last
looking
up
she
beheld
as
it
seemed
to
her
the
prince
camaralzaman
standing
before
her
a
beautiful
young
man
was
making
her
a
very
low
bow
a
magnificent
bow
such
as
she
had
never
seen
before
he
appeared
to
have
dropped
from
the
clouds
he
was
wonderfully
handsome
he
smiled
smiled
as
if
he
were
smiling
on
purpose
extreme
surprise
for
a
moment
kept
gertrude
sitting
still
then
she
rose
without
even
keeping
her
finger
in
her
book
the
young
man
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
still
looked
at
her
smiling
and
smiling
it
was
very
strange
will
you
kindly
tell
me
said
the
mysterious
visitor
at
last
whether
i
have
the
honor
of
speaking
to
miss
wentworth
my
name
is
gertrude
wentworth
murmured
the
young
woman
then
then
i
have
the
honor
the
pleasure
of
being
your
the
young
man
had
so
much
the
character
of
an
apparition
that
this
announcement
seemed
to
complete
his
unreality
what
cousin
who
are
you
said
gertrude
he
stepped
back
a
few
paces
and
looked
up
at
the
house
then
glanced
round
him
at
the
garden
and
the
distant
view
after
this
he
burst
out
laughing
i
see
it
must
seem
to
you
very
strange
he
said
there
was
after
all
something
substantial
in
his
laughter
gertrude
looked
at
him
from
head
to
foot
yes
he
was
remarkably
handsome
but
his
smile
was
almost
a
grimace
it
is
very
still
he
went
on
coming
nearer
again
and
as
she
only
looked
at
him
for
reply
he
added
are
you
all
alone
everyone
has
gone
to
church
said
gertrude
i
was
afraid
of
that
the
young
man
exclaimed
but
i
hope
you
are
not
afraid
of
you
ought
to
tell
me
who
you
are
gertrude
answered
i
am
afraid
of
you
said
the
young
man
i
had
a
different
plan
i
expected
the
servant
would
take
in
my
card
and
that
you
would
put
your
heads
together
before
admitting
me
and
make
out
my
gertrude
had
been
wondering
with
a
quick
intensity
which
brought
its
result
and
the
result
seemed
an
answer
a
wondrous
delightful
answer
to
her
vague
wish
that
something
would
befall
her
i
know
i
know
she
said
you
come
from
we
came
two
days
ago
you
have
heard
of
us
then
you
believe
in
us
we
have
known
vaguely
said
gertrude
that
we
had
relations
in
and
have
you
ever
wanted
to
see
us
asked
the
young
man
gertrude
was
silent
a
moment
i
have
wanted
to
see
i
am
glad
then
it
is
you
i
have
found
we
wanted
to
see
you
so
we
on
purpose
asked
gertrude
the
young
man
looked
round
him
smiling
still
well
yes
on
purpose
does
that
sound
as
if
we
should
bore
you
he
added
i
don
t
think
we
shall
i
really
don
t
think
we
shall
we
are
rather
fond
of
wandering
too
and
we
were
glad
of
a
and
you
have
just
arrived
in
boston
two
days
ago
at
the
inn
i
asked
for
wentworth
he
must
be
your
father
they
found
out
for
me
where
he
lived
they
seemed
often
to
have
heard
of
him
i
determined
to
come
without
ceremony
so
this
lovely
morning
they
set
my
face
in
the
right
direction
and
told
me
to
walk
straight
before
me
out
of
town
i
came
on
foot
because
i
wanted
to
see
the
country
i
walked
and
walked
and
here
i
am
it
s
a
good
many
it
is
seven
miles
and
a
half
said
gertrude
softly
now
that
this
handsome
young
man
was
proving
himself
a
reality
she
found
herself
vaguely
trembling
she
was
deeply
excited
she
had
never
in
her
life
spoken
to
a
foreigner
and
she
had
often
thought
it
would
be
delightful
to
do
so
here
was
one
who
had
suddenly
been
engendered
by
the
sabbath
stillness
for
her
private
use
and
such
a
brilliant
polite
smiling
one
she
found
time
and
means
to
compose
herself
however
to
remind
herself
that
she
must
exercise
a
sort
of
official
hospitality
we
are
very
very
glad
to
see
you
she
said
won
t
you
come
into
the
house
and
she
moved
toward
the
open
door
you
are
not
afraid
of
me
then
asked
the
young
man
again
with
his
light
laugh
she
wondered
a
moment
and
then
we
are
not
afraid
here
she
said
ah
comme
vous
devez
avoir
raison
cried
the
young
man
looking
all
round
him
appreciatively
it
was
the
first
time
that
gertrude
had
heard
so
many
words
of
french
spoken
they
gave
her
something
of
a
sensation
her
companion
followed
her
watching
with
a
certain
excitement
of
his
own
this
tall
girl
dressed
in
her
clear
crisp
muslin
he
paused
in
the
hall
where
there
was
a
broad
white
staircase
with
a
white
balustrade
what
a
pleasant
house
he
said
it
s
lighter
inside
than
it
is
it
s
pleasanter
here
said
gertrude
and
she
led
the
way
into
the
parlor
a
high
clean
rather
room
here
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
the
young
man
smiling
more
than
ever
gertrude
very
serious
trying
to
smile
i
don
t
believe
you
know
my
name
he
said
i
am
called
felix
young
your
father
is
my
uncle
my
mother
was
his
half
sister
and
older
than
yes
said
gertrude
and
she
turned
roman
catholic
and
married
in
i
see
you
know
said
the
young
man
she
married
and
she
died
your
father
s
family
didn
t
like
her
husband
they
called
him
a
foreigner
but
he
was
not
my
poor
father
was
born
in
sicily
but
his
parents
were
in
sicily
gertrude
murmured
it
is
true
said
felix
young
that
they
had
spent
their
lives
in
europe
but
they
were
very
patriotic
and
so
are
and
you
are
sicilian
said
gertrude
sicilian
no
let
s
see
i
was
born
at
a
little
place
a
dear
little
place
in
france
my
sister
was
born
at
so
you
are
french
said
gertrude
heaven
forbid
cried
the
young
man
gertrude
s
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
almost
insistently
he
began
to
laugh
again
i
can
easily
be
french
if
that
will
please
you
are
a
foreigner
of
some
sort
said
gertrude
of
some
sort
yes
i
suppose
so
but
who
can
say
of
what
sort
i
don
t
think
we
have
ever
had
occasion
to
settle
the
question
you
know
there
are
people
like
that
about
their
country
their
religion
their
profession
they
can
t
gertrude
stood
there
gazing
she
had
not
asked
him
to
sit
down
she
had
never
heard
of
people
like
that
she
wanted
to
hear
where
do
you
live
she
asked
they
can
t
tell
that
either
said
felix
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
they
are
little
better
than
vagabonds
i
have
lived
anywhere
everywhere
i
really
think
i
have
lived
in
every
city
in
gertrude
gave
a
little
long
soft
exhalation
it
made
the
young
man
smile
at
her
again
and
his
smile
made
her
blush
a
little
to
take
refuge
from
blushing
she
asked
him
if
after
his
long
walk
he
was
not
hungry
or
thirsty
her
hand
was
in
her
pocket
she
was
fumbling
with
the
little
key
that
her
sister
had
given
her
ah
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
clasping
his
hands
a
little
if
you
could
give
me
in
charity
a
glass
of
wine
gertrude
gave
a
smile
and
a
little
nod
and
went
quickly
out
of
the
room
presently
she
came
back
with
a
very
large
decanter
in
one
hand
and
a
plate
in
the
other
on
which
was
placed
a
big
round
cake
with
a
frosted
top
gertrude
in
taking
the
cake
from
the
closet
had
had
a
moment
of
acute
consciousness
that
it
composed
the
refection
of
which
her
sister
had
thought
that
mr
brand
would
like
to
partake
her
kinsman
from
across
the
seas
was
looking
at
the
pale
engravings
when
she
came
in
he
turned
and
smiled
at
her
as
if
they
had
been
old
friends
meeting
after
a
separation
you
wait
upon
me
yourself
he
asked
i
am
served
like
the
gods
she
had
waited
upon
a
great
many
people
but
none
of
them
had
ever
told
her
that
the
observation
added
a
certain
lightness
to
the
step
with
which
she
went
to
a
little
table
where
there
were
some
curious
red
glasses
glasses
covered
with
little
gold
sprigs
which
charlotte
used
to
dust
every
morning
with
her
own
hands
gertrude
thought
the
glasses
very
handsome
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
her
to
know
that
the
wine
was
good
it
was
her
father
s
famous
madeira
felix
young
thought
it
excellent
he
wondered
why
he
had
been
told
that
there
was
no
wine
in
america
she
cut
him
an
immense
triangle
out
of
the
cake
and
again
she
thought
of
mr
brand
felix
sat
there
with
his
glass
in
one
hand
and
his
huge
morsel
of
cake
in
the
other
eating
drinking
smiling
talking
i
am
very
hungry
he
said
i
am
not
at
all
tired
i
am
never
tired
but
i
am
very
you
must
stay
to
dinner
said
gertrude
at
two
o
clock
they
will
all
have
come
back
from
church
you
will
see
the
who
are
the
others
asked
the
young
man
describe
them
you
will
see
for
yourself
it
is
you
that
must
tell
me
now
about
your
my
sister
is
the
baroness
münster
said
felix
on
hearing
that
his
sister
was
a
baroness
gertrude
got
up
and
walked
about
slowly
in
front
of
him
she
was
silent
a
moment
she
was
thinking
of
it
why
didn
t
she
come
too
she
asked
she
did
come
she
is
in
boston
at
the
we
will
go
and
see
her
said
gertrude
looking
at
him
she
begs
you
will
not
the
young
man
replied
she
sends
you
her
love
she
sent
me
to
announce
her
she
will
come
and
pay
her
respects
to
your
gertrude
felt
herself
trembling
again
a
baroness
münster
who
sent
a
brilliant
young
man
to
announce
her
who
was
coming
as
the
queen
of
sheba
came
to
solomon
to
pay
her
respects
to
quiet
wentworth
such
a
personage
presented
herself
to
gertrude
s
vision
with
a
most
effective
unexpectedness
for
a
moment
she
hardly
knew
what
to
say
when
will
she
come
she
asked
at
last
as
soon
as
you
will
allow
her
tomorrow
she
is
very
impatient
answered
felix
who
wished
to
be
agreeable
tomorrow
yes
said
gertrude
she
wished
to
ask
more
about
her
but
she
hardly
knew
what
could
be
predicated
of
a
baroness
münster
is
she
is
she
married
felix
had
finished
his
cake
and
wine
he
got
up
fixing
upon
the
young
girl
his
bright
expressive
eyes
she
is
married
to
a
german
prince
prince
adolf
of
he
is
not
the
reigning
prince
he
is
a
younger
gertrude
gazed
at
her
informant
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
is
she
a
a
she
asked
at
last
oh
no
said
the
young
man
her
position
is
rather
a
singular
one
it
s
a
morganatic
morganatic
these
were
new
names
and
new
words
to
poor
gertrude
that
s
what
they
call
a
marriage
you
know
contracted
between
a
scion
of
a
ruling
house
and
and
a
common
mortal
they
made
eugenia
a
baroness
poor
woman
but
that
was
all
they
could
do
now
they
want
to
dissolve
the
marriage
prince
adolf
between
ourselves
is
a
ninny
but
his
brother
who
is
a
clever
man
has
plans
for
him
eugenia
naturally
enough
makes
difficulties
not
however
that
i
think
she
cares
much
she
s
a
very
clever
woman
i
m
sure
you
ll
like
her
but
she
wants
to
bother
them
just
now
everything
is
l
the
cheerful
tone
in
which
her
visitor
related
this
darkly
romantic
tale
seemed
to
gertrude
very
strange
but
it
seemed
also
to
convey
a
certain
flattery
to
herself
a
recognition
of
her
wisdom
and
dignity
she
felt
a
dozen
impressions
stirring
within
her
and
presently
the
one
that
was
uppermost
found
words
they
want
to
dissolve
her
marriage
she
asked
so
it
and
against
her
will
against
her
she
must
be
very
unhappy
said
gertrude
her
visitor
looked
at
her
smiling
he
raised
his
hand
to
the
back
of
his
head
and
held
it
there
a
moment
so
she
says
he
answered
that
s
her
story
she
told
me
to
tell
it
tell
me
more
said
gertrude
no
i
will
leave
that
to
her
she
does
it
gertrude
gave
her
little
excited
sigh
again
well
if
she
is
unhappy
she
said
i
am
glad
she
has
come
to
she
had
been
so
interested
that
she
failed
to
notice
the
sound
of
a
footstep
in
the
portico
and
yet
it
was
a
footstep
that
she
always
recognized
she
heard
it
in
the
hall
and
then
she
looked
out
of
the
window
they
were
all
coming
back
from
church
her
father
her
sister
and
brother
and
their
cousins
who
always
came
to
dinner
on
sunday
mr
brand
had
come
in
first
he
was
in
advance
of
the
others
because
apparently
he
was
still
disposed
to
say
what
she
had
not
wished
him
to
say
an
hour
before
he
came
into
the
parlor
looking
for
gertrude
he
had
two
little
books
in
his
hand
on
seeing
gertrude
s
companion
he
slowly
stopped
looking
at
him
is
this
a
cousin
asked
felix
then
gertrude
saw
that
she
must
introduce
him
but
her
ears
and
by
sympathy
her
lips
were
full
of
all
that
he
had
been
telling
her
this
is
the
prince
she
said
the
prince
of
felix
burst
out
laughing
and
mr
brand
stood
staring
while
the
others
who
had
passed
into
the
house
appeared
behind
him
in
the
open
doorway
chapter
iii
that
evening
at
dinner
felix
young
gave
his
sister
the
baroness
münster
an
account
of
his
impressions
she
saw
that
he
had
come
back
in
the
highest
possible
spirits
but
this
fact
to
her
own
mind
was
not
a
reason
for
rejoicing
she
had
but
a
limited
confidence
in
her
brother
s
judgment
his
capacity
for
taking
views
was
such
as
to
vulgarize
one
of
the
prettiest
of
tints
still
she
supposed
he
could
be
trusted
to
give
her
the
mere
facts
and
she
invited
him
with
some
eagerness
to
communicate
them
i
suppose
at
least
they
didn
t
turn
you
out
from
the
door
she
said
you
have
been
away
some
ten
turn
me
from
the
door
felix
exclaimed
they
took
me
to
their
hearts
they
killed
the
fatted
i
know
what
you
want
to
say
they
are
a
collection
of
exactly
said
felix
they
are
a
collection
of
angels
est
bien
remarked
the
baroness
what
are
they
like
like
nothing
you
ever
i
am
sure
i
am
much
obliged
but
that
is
hardly
more
definite
seriously
they
were
glad
to
see
you
enchanted
it
has
been
the
proudest
day
of
my
life
never
never
have
i
been
so
lionized
i
assure
you
i
was
cock
of
the
walk
my
dear
sister
said
the
young
man
n
avons
qu
à
nous
we
shall
be
great
swells
madame
münster
looked
at
him
and
her
eye
exhibited
a
slight
responsive
spark
she
touched
her
lips
to
a
glass
of
wine
and
then
she
said
describe
them
give
me
a
felix
drained
his
own
glass
well
it
s
in
the
country
among
the
meadows
and
woods
a
wild
sort
of
place
and
yet
not
far
from
here
only
such
a
road
my
dear
imagine
one
of
the
alpine
glaciers
reproduced
in
mud
but
you
will
not
spend
much
time
on
it
for
they
want
you
to
come
and
stay
once
for
ah
said
the
baroness
they
want
me
to
come
and
stay
once
for
all
it
s
intensely
rural
tremendously
natural
and
all
overhung
with
this
strange
white
light
this
blue
sky
there
s
a
big
wooden
house
a
kind
of
bungalow
it
looks
like
a
magnified
nuremberg
toy
there
was
a
gentleman
there
that
made
a
speech
to
me
about
it
and
called
it
a
venerable
mansion
but
it
looks
as
if
it
had
been
built
last
is
it
handsome
is
it
elegant
asked
the
baroness
felix
looked
at
her
a
moment
smiling
it
s
very
clean
no
splendors
no
gilding
no
troops
of
servants
rather
chairs
but
you
might
eat
off
the
floors
and
you
can
sit
down
on
the
that
must
be
a
privilege
and
the
inhabitants
are
too
of
my
dear
sister
said
felix
the
inhabitants
are
in
what
style
in
a
style
of
their
own
how
shall
i
describe
it
it
s
primitive
it
s
patriarchal
it
s
the
of
the
golden
and
have
they
nothing
golden
but
their
are
there
no
symptoms
of
wealth
i
should
say
there
was
wealth
without
symptoms
a
plain
homely
way
of
life
nothing
for
show
and
very
little
for
what
shall
i
call
it
for
the
senses
but
a
great
and
a
lot
of
money
out
of
sight
that
comes
forward
very
quietly
for
subscriptions
to
institutions
for
repairing
tenements
for
paying
doctor
s
bills
perhaps
even
for
portioning
and
the
daughters
madame
münster
demanded
how
many
are
there
there
are
two
charlotte
and
are
they
pretty
one
of
them
said
felix
which
is
that
the
young
man
was
silent
looking
at
his
sister
charlotte
he
said
at
last
she
looked
at
him
in
return
i
see
you
are
in
love
with
gertrude
they
must
be
puritans
to
their
anything
but
gay
no
they
are
not
gay
felix
admitted
they
are
sober
they
are
even
severe
they
are
of
a
pensive
cast
they
take
things
hard
i
think
there
is
something
the
matter
with
them
they
have
some
melancholy
memory
or
some
depressing
expectation
it
s
not
the
epicurean
temperament
my
uncle
wentworth
is
a
tremendously
old
fellow
he
looks
as
if
he
were
undergoing
martyrdom
not
by
fire
but
by
freezing
but
we
shall
cheer
them
up
we
shall
do
them
good
they
will
take
a
good
deal
of
stirring
up
but
they
are
wonderfully
kind
and
gentle
and
they
are
appreciative
they
think
one
clever
they
think
one
remarkable
that
is
very
fine
so
far
as
it
goes
said
the
baroness
but
are
we
to
be
shut
up
to
these
three
people
wentworth
and
the
two
young
women
what
did
you
say
their
names
were
deborah
and
hephzibah
oh
no
there
is
another
little
girl
a
cousin
of
theirs
a
very
pretty
creature
a
thorough
little
american
and
then
there
is
the
son
of
the
good
said
the
baroness
we
are
coming
to
the
gentlemen
what
of
the
son
of
the
house
i
am
afraid
he
gets
he
then
has
the
epicurean
temperament
how
old
is
he
he
is
a
boy
of
twenty
a
pretty
young
fellow
but
i
am
afraid
he
has
vulgar
tastes
and
then
there
is
mr
brand
a
very
tall
young
man
a
sort
of
they
seem
to
think
a
good
deal
of
him
but
i
don
t
exactly
make
him
and
is
there
nothing
asked
the
baroness
between
these
extremes
this
mysterious
ecclesiastic
and
that
intemperate
youth
oh
yes
there
is
acton
i
think
said
the
young
man
with
a
nod
at
his
sister
that
you
will
like
remember
that
i
am
very
fastidious
said
the
baroness
has
he
very
good
manners
he
will
have
them
with
you
he
is
a
man
of
the
world
he
has
been
to
madame
münster
gave
a
little
laugh
a
man
of
the
chinese
world
he
must
be
very
i
have
an
idea
that
he
brought
home
a
fortune
said
felix
that
is
always
interesting
is
he
young
clever
he
is
less
than
forty
he
has
a
baldish
head
he
says
witty
things
i
rather
think
added
the
young
man
that
he
will
admire
the
baroness
it
is
very
possible
said
this
lady
her
brother
never
knew
how
she
would
take
things
but
shortly
afterwards
she
declared
that
he
had
made
a
very
pretty
description
and
that
on
the
morrow
she
would
go
and
see
for
herself
they
mounted
accordingly
into
a
great
barouche
a
vehicle
as
to
which
the
baroness
found
nothing
to
criticise
but
the
price
that
was
asked
for
it
and
the
fact
that
the
coachman
wore
a
straw
hat
at
silberstadt
madame
münster
had
had
liveries
of
yellow
and
crimson
they
drove
into
the
country
and
the
baroness
leaning
far
back
and
swaying
her
parasol
looked
to
right
and
to
left
and
surveyed
the
objects
after
a
while
she
pronounced
them
her
brother
remarked
that
it
was
apparently
a
country
in
which
the
foreground
was
inferior
to
the
and
the
baroness
rejoined
that
the
landscape
seemed
to
be
all
foreground
felix
had
fixed
with
his
new
friends
the
hour
at
which
he
should
bring
his
sister
it
was
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
large
house
wore
to
his
eyes
as
the
barouche
drove
up
to
it
a
very
friendly
aspect
the
high
slender
elms
made
lengthening
shadows
in
front
of
it
the
baroness
descended
her
american
kinsfolk
were
stationed
in
the
portico
felix
waved
his
hat
to
them
and
a
tall
lean
gentleman
with
a
high
forehead
and
a
clean
shaven
face
came
forward
toward
the
garden
gate
charlotte
wentworth
walked
at
his
side
gertrude
came
behind
more
slowly
both
of
these
young
ladies
wore
rustling
silk
dresses
felix
ushered
his
sister
into
the
gate
be
very
gracious
he
said
to
her
but
he
saw
the
admonition
was
superfluous
eugenia
was
prepared
to
be
gracious
as
only
eugenia
could
be
felix
knew
no
keener
pleasure
than
to
be
able
to
admire
his
sister
unrestrictedly
for
if
the
opportunity
was
frequent
it
was
not
inveterate
when
she
desired
to
please
she
was
to
him
as
to
everyone
else
the
most
charming
woman
in
the
world
then
he
forgot
that
she
was
ever
anything
else
that
she
was
sometimes
hard
and
perverse
that
he
was
occasionally
afraid
of
her
now
as
she
took
his
arm
to
pass
into
the
garden
he
felt
that
she
desired
that
she
proposed
to
please
and
this
situation
made
him
very
happy
eugenia
would
please
the
tall
gentleman
came
to
meet
her
looking
very
rigid
and
grave
but
it
was
a
rigidity
that
had
no
illiberal
meaning
wentworth
s
manner
was
pregnant
on
the
contrary
with
a
sense
of
grand
responsibility
of
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
of
its
being
difficult
to
show
sufficient
deference
to
a
lady
at
once
so
distinguished
and
so
unhappy
felix
had
observed
on
the
day
before
his
characteristic
pallor
and
now
he
perceived
that
there
was
something
almost
cadaverous
in
his
uncle
s
white
face
but
so
clever
were
this
young
man
s
quick
sympathies
and
perceptions
that
he
already
learned
that
in
these
manifestations
there
was
no
cause
for
alarm
his
light
imagination
had
gained
a
glimpse
of
wentworth
s
spiritual
mechanism
and
taught
him
that
the
old
man
being
infinitely
conscientious
the
special
operation
of
conscience
within
him
announced
itself
by
several
of
the
indications
of
physical
faintness
the
baroness
took
her
uncle
s
hand
and
stood
looking
at
him
with
her
ugly
face
and
her
beautiful
smile
have
i
done
right
to
come
she
asked
very
right
very
right
said
wentworth
solemnly
he
had
arranged
in
his
mind
a
little
speech
but
now
it
quite
faded
away
he
felt
almost
frightened
he
had
never
been
looked
at
in
just
that
way
with
just
that
fixed
intense
smile
by
any
woman
and
it
perplexed
and
weighed
upon
him
now
that
the
woman
who
was
smiling
so
and
who
had
instantly
given
him
a
vivid
sense
of
her
possessing
other
unprecedented
attributes
was
his
own
niece
the
child
of
his
own
father
s
daughter
the
idea
that
his
niece
should
be
a
german
baroness
married
morganatically
to
a
prince
had
already
given
him
much
to
think
about
was
it
right
was
it
just
was
it
acceptable
he
always
slept
badly
and
the
night
before
he
had
lain
awake
much
more
even
than
usual
asking
himself
these
questions
the
strange
word
morganatic
was
constantly
in
his
ears
it
reminded
him
of
a
certain
morgan
whom
he
had
once
known
and
who
had
been
a
bold
unpleasant
woman
he
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
his
duty
so
long
as
the
baroness
looked
at
him
smiling
in
that
way
to
meet
her
glance
with
his
own
scrupulously
adjusted
consciously
frigid
organs
of
vision
but
on
this
occasion
he
failed
to
perform
his
duty
to
the
last
he
looked
away
toward
his
daughters
we
are
very
glad
to
see
you
he
had
said
allow
me
to
introduce
my
daughters
miss
charlotte
wentworth
miss
gertrude
the
baroness
thought
she
had
never
seen
people
less
demonstrative
but
charlotte
kissed
her
and
took
her
hand
looking
at
her
sweetly
and
solemnly
gertrude
seemed
to
her
almost
funereal
though
gertrude
might
have
found
a
source
of
gaiety
in
the
fact
that
felix
with
his
magnificent
smile
had
been
talking
to
her
he
had
greeted
her
as
a
very
old
friend
when
she
kissed
the
baroness
she
had
tears
in
her
eyes
madame
münster
took
each
of
these
young
women
by
the
hand
and
looked
at
them
all
over
charlotte
thought
her
very
and
singularly
dressed
she
could
not
have
said
whether
it
was
well
or
she
was
glad
at
any
rate
that
they
had
put
on
their
silk
gowns
especially
gertrude
my
cousins
are
very
pretty
said
the
baroness
turning
her
eyes
from
one
to
the
other
your
daughters
are
very
handsome
charlotte
blushed
quickly
she
had
never
yet
heard
her
personal
appearance
alluded
to
in
a
loud
expressive
voice
gertrude
looked
away
not
at
felix
she
was
extremely
pleased
it
was
not
the
compliment
that
pleased
her
she
did
not
believe
it
she
thought
herself
very
plain
she
could
hardly
have
told
you
the
source
of
her
satisfaction
it
came
from
something
in
the
way
the
baroness
spoke
and
it
was
not
diminished
it
was
rather
deepened
oddly
enough
by
the
young
girl
s
disbelief
wentworth
was
silent
and
then
he
asked
formally
won
t
you
come
into
the
house
these
are
not
all
you
have
some
other
children
said
the
baroness
i
have
a
son
wentworth
answered
and
why
doesn
t
he
come
to
meet
me
eugenia
cried
i
am
afraid
he
is
not
so
charming
as
his
i
don
t
know
i
will
see
about
it
the
old
man
declared
he
is
rather
afraid
of
ladies
charlotte
said
softly
he
is
very
handsome
said
gertrude
as
loud
as
she
could
we
will
go
in
and
find
him
we
will
draw
him
out
of
his
and
the
baroness
took
wentworth
s
arm
who
was
not
aware
that
he
had
offered
it
to
her
and
who
as
they
walked
toward
the
house
wondered
whether
he
ought
to
have
offered
it
and
whether
it
was
proper
for
her
to
take
it
if
it
had
not
been
offered
i
want
to
know
you
well
said
the
baroness
interrupting
these
meditations
and
i
want
you
to
know
it
seems
natural
that
we
should
know
each
other
wentworth
rejoined
we
are
near
ah
there
comes
a
moment
in
life
when
one
reverts
irresistibly
to
one
s
natural
ties
to
one
s
natural
affections
you
must
have
found
that
said
eugenia
wentworth
had
been
told
the
day
before
by
felix
that
eugenia
was
very
clever
very
brilliant
and
the
information
had
held
him
in
some
suspense
this
was
the
cleverness
he
supposed
the
brilliancy
was
beginning
yes
the
natural
affections
are
very
strong
he
murmured
in
some
people
the
baroness
declared
not
in
charlotte
was
walking
beside
her
she
took
hold
of
her
hand
again
smiling
always
and
you
where
did
you
get
that
enchanting
complexion
she
went
on
such
lilies
and
roses
the
roses
in
poor
charlotte
s
countenance
began
speedily
to
predominate
over
the
lilies
and
she
quickened
her
step
and
reached
the
portico
this
is
the
country
of
complexions
the
baroness
continued
addressing
herself
to
wentworth
i
am
convinced
they
are
more
delicate
there
are
very
good
ones
in
england
in
holland
but
they
are
very
apt
to
be
coarse
there
is
too
much
i
think
you
will
find
said
wentworth
that
this
country
is
superior
in
many
respects
to
those
you
mention
i
have
been
to
england
and
ah
you
have
been
to
europe
cried
the
baroness
why
didn
t
you
come
and
see
me
but
it
s
better
after
all
this
way
she
said
they
were
entering
the
house
she
paused
and
looked
round
her
i
see
you
have
arranged
your
house
your
beautiful
house
in
the
in
the
dutch
taste
the
house
is
very
old
remarked
wentworth
general
washington
once
spent
a
week
oh
i
have
heard
of
washington
cried
the
baroness
my
father
used
to
tell
me
of
wentworth
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
i
found
he
was
very
well
known
in
europe
he
said
felix
had
lingered
in
the
garden
with
gertrude
he
was
standing
before
her
and
smiling
as
he
had
done
the
day
before
what
had
happened
the
day
before
seemed
to
her
a
kind
of
dream
he
had
been
there
and
he
had
changed
everything
the
others
had
seen
him
they
had
talked
with
him
but
that
he
should
come
again
that
he
should
be
part
of
the
future
part
of
her
small
familiar
life
this
needed
afresh
the
evidence
of
her
senses
the
evidence
had
come
to
her
senses
now
and
her
senses
seemed
to
rejoice
in
it
what
do
you
think
of
eugenia
felix
asked
isn
t
she
charming
she
is
very
brilliant
said
gertrude
but
i
can
t
tell
yet
she
seems
to
me
like
a
singer
singing
an
air
you
can
t
tell
till
the
song
is
ah
the
song
will
never
be
done
exclaimed
the
young
man
laughing
don
t
you
think
her
handsome
gertrude
had
been
disappointed
in
the
beauty
of
the
baroness
münster
she
had
expected
her
for
mysterious
reasons
to
resemble
a
very
pretty
portrait
of
the
empress
josephine
of
which
there
hung
an
engraving
in
one
of
the
parlors
and
which
the
younger
miss
wentworth
had
always
greatly
admired
but
the
baroness
was
not
at
all
like
that
not
at
all
though
different
however
she
was
very
wonderful
and
gertrude
felt
herself
most
suggestively
corrected
it
was
strange
nevertheless
that
felix
should
speak
in
that
positive
way
about
his
sister
s
beauty
i
think
i
think
her
handsome
gertrude
said
it
must
be
very
interesting
to
know
her
i
don
t
feel
as
if
i
ever
ah
you
will
know
her
well
you
will
become
great
friends
felix
declared
as
if
this
were
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
she
is
very
graceful
said
gertrude
looking
after
the
baroness
suspended
to
her
father
s
arm
it
was
a
pleasure
to
her
to
say
that
anyone
was
graceful
felix
had
been
looking
about
him
and
your
little
cousin
of
yesterday
he
said
who
was
so
wonderfully
pretty
what
has
become
of
her
she
is
in
the
parlor
gertrude
answered
yes
she
is
very
she
felt
as
if
it
were
her
duty
to
take
him
straight
into
the
house
to
where
he
might
be
near
her
cousin
but
after
hesitating
a
moment
she
lingered
still
i
didn
t
believe
you
would
come
back
she
said
not
come
back
cried
felix
laughing
you
didn
t
know
then
the
impression
made
upon
this
susceptible
heart
of
she
wondered
whether
he
meant
the
impression
her
cousin
lizzie
had
made
well
she
said
i
didn
t
think
we
should
ever
see
you
and
pray
what
did
you
think
would
become
of
me
i
don
t
know
i
thought
you
would
melt
that
s
a
compliment
to
my
solidity
i
melt
very
often
said
felix
but
there
is
always
something
left
of
i
came
and
waited
for
you
by
the
door
because
the
others
did
gertrude
went
on
but
if
you
had
never
appeared
i
should
not
have
been
i
hope
declared
felix
looking
at
her
that
you
would
have
been
she
looked
at
him
a
little
and
shook
her
head
no
no
ah
par
exemple
cried
the
young
man
you
deserve
that
i
should
never
leave
going
into
the
parlor
they
found
wentworth
performing
introductions
a
young
man
was
standing
before
the
baroness
blushing
a
good
deal
laughing
a
little
and
shifting
his
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other
a
slim
young
man
with
features
like
those
of
wentworth
two
other
gentlemen
behind
him
had
risen
from
their
seats
and
a
little
apart
near
one
of
the
windows
stood
a
remarkably
pretty
young
girl
the
young
girl
was
knitting
a
stocking
but
while
her
fingers
quickly
moved
she
looked
with
wide
brilliant
eyes
at
the
baroness
and
what
is
your
son
s
name
said
eugenia
smiling
at
the
young
man
my
name
is
clifford
wentworth
ma
am
he
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
why
didn
t
you
come
out
to
meet
me
clifford
wentworth
the
baroness
demanded
with
her
beautiful
smile
i
didn
t
think
you
would
want
me
said
the
young
man
slowly
sidling
about
one
always
wants
a
if
one
has
one
but
if
you
are
very
nice
to
me
in
future
i
won
t
remember
it
against
and
madame
münster
transferred
her
smile
to
the
other
persons
present
it
rested
first
upon
the
candid
countenance
and
figure
of
mr
brand
whose
eyes
were
intently
fixed
upon
wentworth
as
if
to
beg
him
not
to
prolong
an
anomalous
situation
wentworth
pronounced
his
name
eugenia
gave
him
a
very
charming
glance
and
then
looked
at
the
other
gentleman
this
latter
personage
was
a
man
of
rather
less
than
the
usual
stature
and
the
usual
weight
with
a
quick
observant
agreeable
dark
eye
a
small
quantity
of
thin
dark
hair
and
a
small
moustache
he
had
been
standing
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
when
eugenia
looked
at
him
he
took
them
out
but
he
did
not
like
mr
brand
look
evasively
and
urgently
at
their
host
he
met
eugenia
s
eyes
he
appeared
to
appreciate
the
privilege
of
meeting
them
madame
münster
instantly
felt
that
he
was
intrinsically
the
most
important
person
present
she
was
not
unconscious
that
this
impression
was
in
some
degree
manifested
in
the
little
sympathetic
nod
with
which
she
acknowledged
wentworth
s
announcement
my
cousin
acton
your
cousin
not
mine
said
the
baroness
it
only
depends
upon
you
acton
declared
laughing
the
baroness
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
noticed
that
he
had
very
white
teeth
let
it
depend
upon
your
behavior
she
said
i
think
i
had
better
wait
i
have
cousins
enough
unless
i
can
also
claim
relationship
she
added
with
that
charming
young
lady
and
she
pointed
to
the
young
girl
at
the
window
that
s
my
sister
said
acton
and
gertrude
wentworth
put
her
arm
round
the
young
girl
and
led
her
forward
it
was
not
apparently
that
she
needed
much
leading
she
came
toward
the
baroness
with
a
light
quick
step
and
with
perfect
rolling
her
stocking
round
its
needles
she
had
dark
blue
eyes
and
dark
brown
hair
she
was
wonderfully
pretty
eugenia
kissed
her
as
she
had
kissed
the
other
young
women
and
then
held
her
off
a
little
looking
at
her
now
this
is
quite
another
she
said
she
pronounced
the
word
in
the
french
manner
this
is
a
different
outline
my
uncle
a
different
character
from
that
of
your
own
daughters
this
felix
she
went
on
is
very
much
more
what
we
have
always
thought
of
as
the
american
the
young
girl
during
this
exposition
was
smiling
askance
at
everyone
in
turn
and
at
felix
out
of
turn
i
find
only
one
type
here
cried
felix
laughing
the
type
adorable
this
sally
was
received
in
perfect
silence
but
felix
who
learned
all
things
quickly
had
already
learned
that
the
silences
frequently
observed
among
his
new
acquaintances
were
not
necessarily
restrictive
or
resentful
it
was
as
one
might
say
the
silence
of
expectation
of
modesty
they
were
all
standing
round
his
sister
as
if
they
were
expecting
her
to
acquit
herself
of
the
exhibition
of
some
peculiar
faculty
some
brilliant
talent
their
attitude
seemed
to
imply
that
she
was
a
kind
of
conversational
mountebank
attired
intellectually
in
gauze
and
spangles
this
attitude
gave
a
certain
ironical
force
to
madame
münster
s
next
words
now
this
is
your
circle
she
said
to
her
uncle
this
is
your
these
are
your
regular
eh
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
all
oh
said
wentworth
they
are
always
dropping
in
and
out
you
must
do
the
father
interposed
charlotte
wentworth
they
must
do
something
and
she
turned
her
sweet
serious
face
that
seemed
at
once
timid
and
placid
upon
their
interesting
visitor
what
is
your
name
she
asked
said
the
baroness
smiling
but
you
needn
t
say
all
i
will
say
eugenia
if
you
will
let
me
you
must
come
and
stay
with
the
baroness
laid
her
hand
upon
charlotte
s
arm
very
tenderly
but
she
reserved
herself
she
was
wondering
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
stay
with
these
people
it
would
be
very
charming
very
charming
she
said
and
her
eyes
wandered
over
the
company
over
the
room
she
wished
to
gain
time
before
committing
herself
her
glance
fell
upon
young
mr
brand
who
stood
there
with
his
arms
folded
and
his
hand
on
his
chin
looking
at
her
the
gentleman
i
suppose
is
a
sort
of
ecclesiastic
she
said
to
wentworth
lowering
her
voice
a
little
he
is
a
minister
answered
wentworth
a
protestant
asked
eugenia
i
am
a
unitarian
madam
replied
mr
brand
impressively
ah
i
see
said
eugenia
something
she
had
never
heard
of
this
form
of
worship
acton
began
to
laugh
and
gertrude
looked
anxiously
at
mr
brand
you
have
come
very
far
said
wentworth
very
far
very
far
the
baroness
replied
with
a
graceful
shake
of
her
head
a
shake
that
might
have
meant
many
different
things
that
s
a
reason
why
you
ought
to
settle
down
with
us
said
wentworth
with
that
dryness
of
utterance
which
as
eugenia
was
too
intelligent
not
to
feel
took
nothing
from
the
delicacy
of
his
meaning
she
looked
at
him
and
for
an
instant
in
his
cold
still
face
she
seemed
to
see
a
likeness
to
the
vaguely
remembered
image
of
her
mother
eugenia
was
a
woman
of
sudden
emotions
and
now
unexpectedly
she
felt
one
rising
in
her
heart
she
kept
looking
round
the
circle
she
knew
that
there
was
admiration
in
all
the
eyes
that
were
fixed
upon
her
she
smiled
at
them
all
i
came
to
look
to
try
to
ask
she
said
it
seems
to
me
i
have
done
well
i
am
very
tired
i
want
to
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
the
luminous
interior
the
gentle
tranquil
people
the
simple
serious
life
the
sense
of
these
things
pressed
upon
her
with
an
overmastering
force
and
she
felt
herself
yielding
to
one
of
the
most
genuine
emotions
she
had
ever
known
i
should
like
to
stay
here
she
said
pray
take
me
though
she
was
smiling
there
were
tears
in
her
voice
as
well
as
in
her
eyes
my
dear
niece
said
wentworth
softly
and
charlotte
put
out
her
arms
and
drew
the
baroness
toward
her
while
robert
acton
turned
away
with
his
hands
stealing
into
his
pockets
chapter
iv
a
few
days
after
the
baroness
münster
had
presented
herself
to
her
american
kinsfolk
she
came
with
her
brother
and
took
up
her
abode
in
that
small
white
house
adjacent
to
wentworth
s
own
dwelling
of
which
mention
has
already
been
made
it
was
on
going
with
his
daughters
to
return
her
visit
that
wentworth
placed
this
comfortable
cottage
at
her
service
the
offer
being
the
result
of
a
domestic
colloquy
diffused
through
the
ensuing
hours
in
the
course
of
which
the
two
foreign
visitors
were
discussed
and
analyzed
with
a
great
deal
of
earnestness
and
subtlety
the
discussion
went
forward
as
i
say
in
the
family
circle
but
that
circle
on
the
evening
following
madame
münster
s
return
to
town
as
on
many
other
occasions
included
robert
acton
and
his
pretty
sister
if
you
had
been
present
it
would
probably
not
have
seemed
to
you
that
the
advent
of
these
brilliant
strangers
was
treated
as
an
exhilarating
occurrence
a
pleasure
the
more
in
this
tranquil
household
a
prospective
source
of
entertainment
this
was
not
wentworth
s
way
of
treating
any
human
occurrence
the
sudden
irruption
into
the
consciousness
of
the
wentworths
of
an
element
not
allowed
for
in
its
scheme
of
usual
obligations
required
a
readjustment
of
that
sense
of
responsibility
which
constituted
its
principal
furniture
to
consider
an
event
crudely
and
baldly
in
the
light
of
the
pleasure
it
might
bring
them
was
an
intellectual
exercise
with
which
felix
young
s
american
cousins
were
almost
wholly
unacquainted
and
which
they
scarcely
supposed
to
be
largely
pursued
in
any
section
of
human
society
the
arrival
of
felix
and
his
sister
was
a
satisfaction
but
it
was
a
singularly
joyless
and
inelastic
satisfaction
it
was
an
extension
of
duty
of
the
exercise
of
the
more
recondite
virtues
but
neither
wentworth
nor
charlotte
nor
mr
brand
who
among
these
excellent
people
was
a
great
promoter
of
reflection
and
aspiration
frankly
adverted
to
it
as
an
extension
of
enjoyment
this
function
was
ultimately
assumed
by
gertrude
wentworth
who
was
a
peculiar
girl
but
the
full
compass
of
whose
peculiarities
had
not
been
exhibited
before
they
very
ingeniously
found
their
pretext
in
the
presence
of
these
possibly
too
agreeable
foreigners
gertrude
however
had
to
struggle
with
a
great
accumulation
of
obstructions
both
of
the
subjective
as
the
metaphysicians
say
and
of
the
objective
order
and
indeed
it
is
no
small
part
of
the
purpose
of
this
little
history
to
set
forth
her
struggle
what
seemed
paramount
in
this
abrupt
enlargement
of
wentworth
s
sympathies
and
those
of
his
daughters
was
an
extension
of
the
field
of
possible
mistakes
and
the
doctrine
as
it
may
almost
be
called
of
the
oppressive
gravity
of
mistakes
was
one
of
the
most
cherished
traditions
of
the
wentworth
family
i
don
t
believe
she
wants
to
come
and
stay
in
this
house
said
gertrude
madame
münster
from
this
time
forward
receiving
no
other
designation
than
the
personal
pronoun
charlotte
and
gertrude
acquired
considerable
facility
in
addressing
her
directly
as
eugenia
but
in
speaking
of
her
to
each
other
they
rarely
called
her
anything
but
doesn
t
she
think
it
good
enough
for
her
cried
little
lizzie
acton
who
was
always
asking
unpractical
questions
that
required
in
strictness
no
answer
and
to
which
indeed
she
expected
no
other
answer
than
such
as
she
herself
invariably
furnished
in
a
small
laugh
she
certainly
expressed
a
willingness
to
come
said
wentworth
that
was
only
politeness
gertrude
rejoined
yes
she
is
very
polite
very
polite
said
wentworth
she
is
too
polite
his
son
declared
in
a
softly
growling
tone
which
was
habitual
to
him
but
which
was
an
indication
of
nothing
worse
than
a
vaguely
humorous
intention
it
is
very
that
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
you
sir
said
lizzie
acton
with
her
little
laugh
well
i
don
t
mean
to
encourage
her
clifford
went
on
i
m
sure
i
don
t
care
if
you
do
cried
lizzie
she
will
not
think
of
you
clifford
said
gertrude
gravely
i
hope
not
clifford
exclaimed
she
will
think
of
robert
gertrude
continued
in
the
same
tone
robert
acton
began
to
blush
but
there
was
no
occasion
for
it
for
everyone
was
looking
at
gertrude
everyone
at
least
save
lizzie
who
with
her
pretty
head
on
one
side
contemplated
her
brother
why
do
you
attribute
motives
gertrude
asked
wentworth
i
don
t
attribute
motives
father
said
gertrude
i
only
say
she
will
think
of
robert
and
she
will
gertrude
judges
by
herself
acton
exclaimed
laughing
don
t
you
gertrude
of
course
the
baroness
will
think
of
me
she
will
think
of
me
from
morning
till
she
will
be
very
comfortable
here
said
charlotte
with
something
of
a
housewife
s
pride
she
can
have
the
large
northeast
room
and
the
french
bedstead
charlotte
added
with
a
constant
sense
of
the
lady
s
foreignness
she
will
not
like
it
said
gertrude
not
even
if
you
pin
little
tidies
all
over
the
why
not
dear
asked
charlotte
perceiving
a
touch
of
irony
here
but
not
resenting
it
gertrude
had
left
her
chair
she
was
walking
about
the
room
her
stiff
silk
dress
which
she
had
put
on
in
honor
of
the
baroness
made
a
sound
upon
the
carpet
i
don
t
know
she
replied
she
will
want
something
more
more
if
she
wants
to
be
private
she
can
stay
in
her
room
lizzie
acton
remarked
gertrude
paused
in
her
walk
looking
at
her
that
would
not
be
pleasant
she
answered
she
wants
privacy
and
pleasure
robert
acton
began
to
laugh
again
my
dear
cousin
what
a
picture
charlotte
had
fixed
her
serious
eyes
upon
her
sister
she
wondered
whence
she
had
suddenly
derived
these
strange
notions
wentworth
also
observed
his
younger
daughter
i
don
t
know
what
her
manner
of
life
may
have
been
he
said
but
she
certainly
never
can
have
enjoyed
a
more
refined
and
salubrious
gertrude
stood
there
looking
at
them
all
she
is
the
wife
of
a
prince
she
said
we
are
all
princes
here
said
wentworth
and
i
don
t
know
of
any
palace
in
this
neighborhood
that
is
to
cousin
william
robert
acton
interposed
do
you
want
to
do
something
handsome
make
them
a
present
for
three
months
of
the
little
house
over
the
you
are
very
generous
with
other
people
s
things
cried
his
sister
robert
is
very
generous
with
his
own
things
wentworth
observed
dispassionately
and
looking
in
cold
meditation
at
his
kinsman
gertrude
lizzie
went
on
i
had
an
idea
you
were
so
fond
of
your
new
which
new
cousin
asked
gertrude
i
don
t
mean
the
baroness
the
young
girl
rejoined
with
her
laugh
i
thought
you
expected
to
see
so
much
of
of
felix
i
hope
to
see
a
great
deal
of
him
said
gertrude
simply
then
why
do
you
want
to
keep
him
out
of
the
house
gertrude
looked
at
lizzie
acton
and
then
looked
away
should
you
want
me
to
live
in
the
house
with
you
lizzie
asked
clifford
i
hope
you
never
will
i
hate
you
such
was
this
young
lady
s
reply
father
said
gertrude
stopping
before
wentworth
and
smiling
with
a
smile
the
sweeter
as
her
smile
always
was
for
its
rarity
do
let
them
live
in
the
little
house
over
the
way
it
will
be
lovely
robert
acton
had
been
watching
her
gertrude
is
right
he
said
gertrude
is
the
cleverest
girl
in
the
world
if
i
might
take
the
liberty
i
should
strongly
recommend
their
living
there
is
nothing
there
so
pretty
as
the
northeast
room
charlotte
urged
she
will
make
it
pretty
leave
her
alone
acton
exclaimed
gertrude
at
his
compliment
had
blushed
and
looked
at
him
it
was
as
if
someone
less
familiar
had
complimented
her
i
am
sure
she
will
make
it
pretty
it
will
be
very
interesting
it
will
be
a
place
to
go
to
it
will
be
a
foreign
are
we
very
sure
that
we
need
a
foreign
house
wentworth
inquired
do
you
think
it
desirable
to
establish
a
foreign
house
in
this
quiet
place
you
speak
said
acton
laughing
as
if
it
were
a
question
of
the
poor
baroness
opening
a
or
a
it
would
be
too
lovely
gertrude
declared
again
laying
her
hand
on
the
back
of
her
father
s
chair
that
she
should
open
a
charlotte
asked
with
great
gravity
gertrude
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
then
yes
charlotte
she
said
simply
gertrude
is
growing
pert
clifford
wentworth
observed
with
his
humorous
young
growl
that
comes
of
associating
with
wentworth
looked
up
at
his
daughter
who
was
standing
beside
him
he
drew
her
gently
forward
you
must
be
careful
he
said
you
must
keep
watch
indeed
we
must
all
be
careful
this
is
a
great
change
we
are
to
be
exposed
to
peculiar
influences
i
don
t
say
they
are
bad
i
don
t
judge
them
in
advance
but
they
may
perhaps
make
it
necessary
that
we
should
exercise
a
great
deal
of
wisdom
and
it
will
be
a
different
gertrude
was
silent
a
moment
in
deference
to
her
father
s
speech
then
she
spoke
in
a
manner
that
was
not
in
the
least
an
answer
to
it
i
want
to
see
how
they
will
live
i
am
sure
they
will
have
different
hours
she
will
do
all
kinds
of
little
things
differently
when
we
go
over
there
it
will
be
like
going
to
europe
she
will
have
a
boudoir
she
will
invite
us
to
dinner
very
late
she
will
breakfast
in
her
charlotte
gazed
at
her
sister
again
gertrude
s
imagination
seemed
to
her
to
be
fairly
running
riot
she
had
always
known
that
gertrude
had
a
great
deal
of
imagination
she
had
been
very
proud
of
it
but
at
the
same
time
she
had
always
felt
that
it
was
a
dangerous
and
irresponsible
faculty
and
now
to
her
sense
for
the
moment
it
seemed
to
threaten
to
make
her
sister
a
strange
person
who
should
come
in
suddenly
as
from
a
journey
talking
of
the
peculiar
and
possibly
unpleasant
things
she
had
observed
charlotte
s
imagination
took
no
journeys
whatever
she
kept
it
as
it
were
in
her
pocket
with
the
other
furniture
of
this
receptacle
a
thimble
a
little
box
of
peppermint
and
a
morsel
of
i
don
t
believe
she
would
have
any
dinner
or
any
breakfast
said
miss
wentworth
i
don
t
believe
she
knows
how
to
do
anything
herself
i
should
have
to
get
her
ever
so
many
servants
and
she
wouldn
t
like
she
has
a
maid
said
gertrude
a
french
maid
she
mentioned
i
wonder
if
the
maid
has
a
little
fluted
cap
and
red
slippers
said
lizzie
acton
there
was
a
french
maid
in
that
play
that
robert
took
me
to
see
she
had
pink
stockings
she
was
very
she
was
a
gertrude
announced
who
had
never
seen
a
play
in
her
life
they
call
that
a
soubrette
it
will
be
a
great
chance
to
learn
charlotte
gave
a
little
soft
helpless
groan
she
had
a
vision
of
a
wicked
theatrical
person
clad
in
pink
stockings
and
red
shoes
and
speaking
with
confounding
volubility
an
incomprehensible
tongue
flitting
through
the
sacred
penetralia
of
that
large
clean
house
that
is
one
reason
in
favor
of
their
coming
here
gertrude
went
on
but
we
can
make
eugenia
speak
french
to
us
and
felix
i
mean
to
begin
the
next
wentworth
had
kept
her
standing
near
him
and
he
gave
her
his
earnest
thin
unresponsive
glance
again
i
want
you
to
make
me
a
promise
gertrude
he
said
what
is
it
she
asked
smiling
not
to
get
excited
not
to
allow
these
these
occurrences
to
be
an
occasion
for
she
looked
down
at
him
a
moment
and
then
she
shook
her
head
i
don
t
think
i
can
promise
that
father
i
am
excited
wentworth
was
silent
a
while
they
all
were
silent
as
if
in
recognition
of
something
audacious
and
portentous
i
think
they
had
better
go
to
the
other
house
said
charlotte
quietly
i
shall
keep
them
in
the
other
house
wentworth
subjoined
more
pregnantly
gertrude
turned
away
then
she
looked
across
at
robert
acton
her
cousin
robert
was
a
great
friend
of
hers
she
often
looked
at
him
this
way
instead
of
saying
things
her
glance
on
this
occasion
however
struck
him
as
a
substitute
for
a
larger
volume
of
diffident
utterance
than
usual
inviting
him
to
observe
among
other
things
the
inefficiency
of
her
father
s
design
if
design
it
was
for
diminishing
in
the
interest
of
quiet
nerves
their
occasions
of
contact
with
their
foreign
relatives
but
acton
immediately
complimented
wentworth
upon
his
liberality
that
s
a
very
nice
thing
to
do
he
said
giving
them
the
little
house
you
will
have
treated
them
handsomely
and
whatever
happens
you
will
be
glad
of
wentworth
was
liberal
and
he
knew
he
was
liberal
it
gave
him
pleasure
to
know
it
to
feel
it
to
see
it
recorded
and
this
pleasure
is
the
only
palpable
form
of
with
which
the
narrator
of
these
incidents
will
be
able
to
charge
him
a
three
days
visit
at
most
over
there
is
all
i
should
have
found
possible
madame
münster
remarked
to
her
brother
after
they
had
taken
possession
of
the
little
white
house
it
would
have
been
too
decidedly
too
breakfast
dinner
and
tea
it
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
world
if
i
could
have
reached
the
third
and
she
made
the
same
observation
to
her
maid
augustine
an
intelligent
person
who
enjoyed
a
liberal
share
of
her
confidence
felix
declared
that
he
would
willingly
spend
his
life
in
the
bosom
of
the
wentworth
family
that
they
were
the
kindest
simplest
most
amiable
people
in
the
world
and
that
he
had
taken
a
prodigious
fancy
to
them
all
the
baroness
quite
agreed
with
him
that
they
were
simple
and
kind
they
were
thoroughly
nice
people
and
she
liked
them
extremely
the
girls
were
perfect
ladies
it
was
impossible
to
be
more
of
a
lady
than
charlotte
wentworth
in
spite
of
her
little
village
air
but
as
for
thinking
them
the
best
company
in
the
world
said
the
baroness
that
is
another
thing
and
as
for
wishing
to
live
à
with
them
i
should
as
soon
think
of
wishing
myself
back
in
the
convent
again
to
wear
a
bombazine
apron
and
sleep
in
a
and
yet
the
baroness
was
in
high
good
humor
she
had
been
very
much
pleased
with
her
lively
perception
and
her
refined
imagination
she
was
capable
of
enjoying
anything
that
was
characteristic
anything
that
was
good
of
its
kind
the
wentworth
household
seemed
to
her
very
perfect
in
its
kind
wonderfully
peaceful
and
unspotted
pervaded
by
a
sort
of
freshness
that
had
all
the
quietude
and
benevolence
of
what
she
deemed
to
be
quakerism
and
yet
seemed
to
be
founded
upon
a
degree
of
material
abundance
for
which
in
certain
matters
of
detail
one
might
have
looked
in
vain
at
the
frugal
little
court
of
she
perceived
immediately
that
her
american
relatives
thought
and
talked
very
little
about
money
and
this
of
itself
made
an
impression
upon
eugenia
s
imagination
she
perceived
at
the
same
time
that
if
charlotte
or
gertrude
should
ask
their
father
for
a
very
considerable
sum
he
would
at
once
place
it
in
their
hands
and
this
made
a
still
greater
impression
the
greatest
impression
of
all
perhaps
was
made
by
another
rapid
induction
the
baroness
had
an
immediate
conviction
that
robert
acton
would
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
every
day
in
the
week
if
that
little
sister
of
his
should
bid
him
the
men
in
this
country
said
the
baroness
are
evidently
very
obliging
her
declaration
that
she
was
looking
for
rest
and
retirement
had
been
by
no
means
wholly
untrue
nothing
that
the
baroness
said
was
wholly
untrue
it
is
but
fair
to
add
perhaps
that
nothing
that
she
said
was
wholly
true
she
wrote
to
a
friend
in
germany
that
it
was
a
return
to
nature
it
was
like
drinking
new
milk
and
she
was
very
fond
of
new
milk
she
said
to
herself
of
course
that
it
would
be
a
little
dull
but
there
can
be
no
better
proof
of
her
good
spirits
than
the
fact
that
she
thought
she
should
not
mind
its
being
a
little
dull
it
seemed
to
her
when
from
the
piazza
of
her
eleemosynary
cottage
she
looked
out
over
the
soundless
fields
the
stony
pastures
the
ponds
the
rugged
little
orchards
that
she
had
never
been
in
the
midst
of
so
peculiarly
intense
a
stillness
it
was
almost
a
delicate
sensual
pleasure
it
was
all
very
good
very
innocent
and
safe
and
out
of
it
something
good
must
come
augustine
indeed
who
had
an
unbounded
faith
in
her
mistress
s
wisdom
and
was
a
great
deal
perplexed
and
depressed
she
was
always
ready
to
take
her
cue
when
she
understood
it
but
she
liked
to
understand
it
and
on
this
occasion
comprehension
failed
what
indeed
was
the
baroness
doing
cette
what
fish
did
she
expect
to
land
out
of
these
very
stagnant
waters
the
game
was
evidently
a
deep
one
augustine
could
trust
her
but
the
sense
of
walking
in
the
dark
betrayed
itself
in
the
physiognomy
of
this
spare
sober
sallow
person
who
had
nothing
in
common
with
gertrude
wentworth
s
conception
of
a
soubrette
by
the
most
ironical
scowl
that
had
ever
rested
upon
the
unpretending
tokens
of
the
peace
and
plenty
of
the
wentworths
fortunately
augustine
could
quench
skepticism
in
action
she
quite
agreed
with
her
mistress
or
rather
she
quite
her
mistress
in
thinking
that
the
little
white
house
was
pitifully
bare
il
faudra
said
augustine
lui
faire
un
peu
de
and
she
began
to
hang
up
in
the
doorways
to
place
wax
candles
procured
after
some
research
in
unexpected
situations
to
dispose
anomalous
draperies
over
the
arms
of
sofas
and
the
backs
of
chairs
the
baroness
had
brought
with
her
to
the
new
world
a
copious
provision
of
the
element
of
costume
and
the
two
miss
wentworths
when
they
came
over
to
see
her
were
somewhat
bewildered
by
the
obtrusive
distribution
of
her
wardrobe
there
were
india
shawls
suspended
in
the
parlor
door
and
curious
fabrics
corresponding
to
gertrude
s
metaphysical
vision
of
an
tumbled
about
in
the
there
were
pink
silk
blinds
in
the
windows
by
which
the
room
was
strangely
bedimmed
and
along
the
was
disposed
a
remarkable
band
of
velvet
covered
with
coarse
lace
i
have
been
making
myself
a
little
comfortable
said
the
baroness
much
to
the
confusion
of
charlotte
who
had
been
on
the
point
of
proposing
to
come
and
help
her
put
her
superfluous
draperies
away
but
what
charlotte
mistook
for
an
almost
culpably
delayed
subsidence
gertrude
very
presently
perceived
to
be
the
most
ingenious
the
most
interesting
the
most
romantic
intention
what
is
life
indeed
without
curtains
she
secretly
asked
herself
and
she
appeared
to
herself
to
have
been
leading
hitherto
an
existence
singularly
garish
and
totally
devoid
of
festoons
felix
was
not
a
young
man
who
troubled
himself
greatly
about
anything
least
of
all
about
the
conditions
of
enjoyment
his
faculty
of
enjoyment
was
so
large
so
unconsciously
eager
that
it
may
be
said
of
it
that
it
had
a
permanent
advance
upon
embarrassment
and
sorrow
his
sentient
faculty
was
intrinsically
joyous
and
novelty
and
change
were
in
themselves
a
delight
to
him
as
they
had
come
to
him
with
a
great
deal
of
frequency
his
life
had
been
more
agreeable
than
appeared
never
was
a
nature
more
perfectly
fortunate
it
was
not
a
restless
apprehensive
ambitious
spirit
running
a
race
with
the
tyranny
of
fate
but
a
temper
so
unsuspicious
as
to
put
adversity
off
her
guard
dodging
and
evading
her
with
the
easy
natural
motion
of
a
flower
felix
extracted
entertainment
from
all
things
and
all
his
faculties
his
imagination
his
intelligence
his
affections
his
senses
had
a
hand
in
the
game
it
seemed
to
him
that
eugenia
and
he
had
been
very
well
treated
there
was
something
absolutely
touching
in
that
combination
of
paternal
liberality
and
social
considerateness
which
marked
wentworth
s
deportment
it
was
most
uncommonly
kind
of
him
for
instance
to
have
given
them
a
house
felix
was
positively
amused
at
having
a
house
of
his
own
for
the
little
white
cottage
among
the
apple
trees
the
chalet
as
madame
münster
always
called
it
was
much
more
sensibly
his
own
than
any
domiciliary
looking
upon
a
court
with
the
rent
overdue
felix
had
spent
a
good
deal
of
his
life
in
looking
into
courts
with
a
perhaps
slightly
tattered
pair
of
elbows
resting
upon
the
ledge
of
a
window
and
the
thin
smoke
of
a
cigarette
rising
into
an
atmosphere
in
which
died
away
and
the
vibration
of
chimes
from
ancient
belfries
became
sensible
he
had
never
known
anything
so
infinitely
rural
as
these
new
england
fields
and
he
took
a
great
fancy
to
all
their
pastoral
roughnesses
he
had
never
had
a
greater
sense
of
luxurious
security
and
at
the
risk
of
making
him
seem
a
rather
sordid
adventurer
i
must
declare
that
he
found
an
irresistible
charm
in
the
fact
that
he
might
dine
every
day
at
his
uncle
s
the
charm
was
irresistible
however
because
his
fancy
flung
a
rosy
light
over
this
homely
privilege
he
appreciated
highly
the
fare
that
was
set
before
him
there
was
a
kind
of
abundance
about
it
which
made
him
think
that
people
must
have
lived
so
in
the
mythological
era
when
they
spread
their
tables
upon
the
grass
replenished
them
from
cornucopias
and
had
no
particular
need
of
kitchen
stoves
but
the
great
thing
that
felix
enjoyed
was
having
found
a
family
sitting
in
the
midst
of
gentle
generous
people
whom
he
might
call
by
their
first
names
he
had
never
known
anything
more
charming
than
the
attention
they
paid
to
what
he
said
it
was
like
a
large
sheet
of
clean
all
ready
to
be
washed
over
with
effective
splashes
of
he
had
never
had
any
cousins
and
he
had
never
before
found
himself
in
contact
so
unrestricted
with
young
unmarried
ladies
he
was
extremely
fond
of
the
society
of
ladies
and
it
was
new
to
him
that
it
might
be
enjoyed
in
just
this
manner
at
first
he
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
his
state
of
mind
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
in
love
indiscriminately
with
three
girls
at
once
he
saw
that
lizzie
acton
was
more
brilliantly
pretty
than
charlotte
and
gertrude
but
this
was
scarcely
a
superiority
his
pleasure
came
from
something
they
had
in
common
a
part
of
which
was
indeed
that
physical
delicacy
which
seemed
to
make
it
proper
that
they
should
always
dress
in
thin
materials
and
clear
colors
but
they
were
delicate
in
other
ways
and
it
was
most
agreeable
to
him
to
feel
that
these
latter
delicacies
were
appreciable
by
contact
as
it
were
he
had
known
fortunately
many
virtuous
gentlewomen
but
it
now
appeared
to
him
that
in
his
relations
with
them
especially
when
they
were
unmarried
he
had
been
looking
at
pictures
under
glass
he
perceived
at
present
what
a
nuisance
the
glass
had
been
how
it
perverted
and
interfered
how
it
caught
the
reflection
of
other
objects
and
kept
you
walking
from
side
to
side
he
had
no
need
to
ask
himself
whether
charlotte
and
gertrude
and
lizzie
acton
were
in
the
right
light
they
were
always
in
the
right
light
he
liked
everything
about
them
he
was
for
instance
not
at
all
above
liking
the
fact
that
they
had
very
slender
feet
and
high
insteps
he
liked
their
pretty
noses
he
liked
their
surprised
eyes
and
their
hesitating
not
at
all
positive
way
of
speaking
he
liked
so
much
knowing
that
he
was
perfectly
at
liberty
to
be
alone
for
hours
anywhere
with
either
of
them
that
preference
for
one
to
the
other
as
a
companion
of
solitude
remained
a
minor
affair
charlotte
wentworth
s
sweetly
severe
features
were
as
agreeable
as
lizzie
acton
s
wonderfully
expressive
blue
eyes
and
gertrude
s
air
of
being
always
ready
to
walk
about
and
listen
was
as
charming
as
anything
else
especially
as
she
walked
very
gracefully
after
a
while
felix
began
to
distinguish
but
even
then
he
would
often
wish
suddenly
that
they
were
not
all
so
sad
even
lizzie
acton
in
spite
of
her
fine
little
chatter
and
laughter
appeared
sad
even
clifford
wentworth
who
had
extreme
youth
in
his
favor
and
kept
a
buggy
with
enormous
wheels
and
a
little
sorrel
mare
with
the
prettiest
legs
in
the
world
even
this
fortunate
lad
was
apt
to
have
an
averted
uncomfortable
glance
and
to
edge
away
from
you
at
times
in
the
manner
of
a
person
with
a
bad
conscience
the
only
person
in
the
circle
with
no
sense
of
oppression
of
any
kind
was
to
felix
s
perception
robert
acton
it
might
perhaps
have
been
feared
that
after
the
completion
of
those
graceful
domiciliary
embellishments
which
have
been
mentioned
madame
münster
would
have
found
herself
confronted
with
alarming
possibilities
of
but
as
yet
she
had
not
taken
the
alarm
the
baroness
was
a
restless
soul
and
she
projected
her
restlessness
as
it
may
be
said
into
any
situation
that
lay
before
her
up
to
a
certain
point
her
restlessness
might
be
counted
upon
to
entertain
her
she
was
always
expecting
something
to
happen
and
until
it
was
disappointed
expectancy
itself
was
a
delicate
pleasure
what
the
baroness
expected
just
now
it
would
take
some
ingenuity
to
set
forth
it
is
enough
that
while
she
looked
about
her
she
found
something
to
occupy
her
imagination
she
assured
herself
that
she
was
enchanted
with
her
new
relatives
she
professed
to
herself
that
like
her
brother
she
felt
it
a
sacred
satisfaction
to
have
found
a
family
it
is
certain
that
she
enjoyed
to
the
utmost
the
gentleness
of
her
kinsfolk
s
deference
she
had
first
and
last
received
a
great
deal
of
admiration
and
her
experience
of
compliments
was
very
considerable
but
she
knew
that
she
had
never
been
so
real
a
power
never
counted
for
so
much
as
now
when
for
the
first
time
the
standard
of
comparison
of
her
little
circle
was
a
prey
to
vagueness
the
sense
indeed
that
the
good
people
about
her
had
as
regards
her
remarkable
self
no
standard
of
comparison
at
all
gave
her
a
feeling
of
almost
illimitable
power
it
was
true
as
she
said
to
herself
that
if
for
this
reason
they
would
be
able
to
discover
nothing
against
her
so
they
would
perhaps
neglect
to
perceive
some
of
her
superior
points
but
she
always
wound
up
her
reflections
by
declaring
that
she
would
take
care
of
that
charlotte
and
gertrude
were
in
some
perplexity
between
their
desire
to
show
all
proper
attention
to
madame
münster
and
their
fear
of
being
importunate
the
little
house
in
the
orchard
had
hitherto
been
occupied
during
the
summer
months
by
intimate
friends
of
the
family
or
by
poor
relations
who
found
in
wentworth
a
landlord
attentive
to
repairs
and
oblivious
of
under
these
circumstances
the
open
door
of
the
small
house
and
that
of
the
large
one
facing
each
other
across
their
homely
gardens
levied
no
tax
upon
hourly
visits
but
the
misses
wentworth
received
an
impression
that
eugenia
was
no
friend
to
the
primitive
custom
of
dropping
in
she
evidently
had
no
idea
of
living
without
a
one
goes
into
your
house
as
into
an
inn
except
that
there
are
no
servants
rushing
forward
she
said
to
charlotte
and
she
added
that
that
was
very
charming
gertrude
explained
to
her
sister
that
she
meant
just
the
reverse
she
didn
t
like
it
at
all
charlotte
inquired
why
she
should
tell
an
untruth
and
gertrude
answered
that
there
was
probably
some
very
good
reason
for
it
which
they
should
discover
when
they
knew
her
better
there
can
surely
be
no
good
reason
for
telling
an
untruth
said
charlotte
i
hope
she
does
not
think
they
had
of
course
desired
from
the
first
to
do
everything
in
the
way
of
helping
her
to
arrange
herself
it
had
seemed
to
charlotte
that
there
would
be
a
great
many
things
to
talk
about
but
the
baroness
was
apparently
inclined
to
talk
about
nothing
write
her
a
note
asking
her
leave
to
come
and
see
her
i
think
that
is
what
she
will
like
said
gertrude
why
should
i
give
her
the
trouble
of
answering
me
charlotte
asked
she
will
have
to
write
a
note
and
send
it
i
don
t
think
she
will
take
any
trouble
said
gertrude
profoundly
what
then
will
she
do
that
is
what
i
am
curious
to
see
said
gertrude
leaving
her
sister
with
an
impression
that
her
curiosity
was
morbid
they
went
to
see
the
baroness
without
preliminary
correspondence
and
in
the
little
salon
which
she
had
already
created
with
its
becoming
light
and
its
festoons
they
found
robert
acton
eugenia
was
intensely
gracious
but
she
accused
them
of
neglecting
her
cruelly
you
see
acton
has
had
to
take
pity
upon
me
she
said
my
brother
goes
off
sketching
for
hours
i
can
never
depend
upon
him
so
i
was
to
send
acton
to
beg
you
to
come
and
give
me
the
benefit
of
your
gertrude
looked
at
her
sister
she
wanted
to
say
is
what
she
would
have
charlotte
said
that
they
hoped
the
baroness
would
always
come
and
dine
with
them
it
would
give
them
so
much
pleasure
and
in
that
case
she
would
spare
herself
the
trouble
of
having
a
cook
ah
but
i
must
have
a
cook
cried
the
baroness
an
old
negress
in
a
yellow
turban
i
have
set
my
heart
upon
that
i
want
to
look
out
of
my
window
and
see
her
sitting
there
on
the
grass
against
the
background
of
those
crooked
dusky
little
apple
trees
pulling
the
husks
off
a
lapful
of
indian
corn
that
will
be
local
color
you
know
there
isn
t
much
of
it
here
you
don
t
mind
my
saying
that
do
you
so
one
must
make
the
most
of
what
one
can
get
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
dine
with
you
whenever
you
will
let
me
but
i
want
to
be
able
to
ask
you
sometimes
and
i
want
to
be
able
to
ask
acton
added
the
baroness
you
must
come
and
ask
me
at
home
said
acton
you
must
come
and
see
me
you
must
dine
with
me
first
i
want
to
show
you
my
place
i
want
to
introduce
you
to

he
called
again
upon
madame
münster
two
days
later
he
was
constantly
at
the
other
house
he
used
to
walk
across
the
fields
from
his
own
place
and
he
appeared
to
have
fewer
scruples
than
his
cousins
with
regard
to
dropping
in
on
this
occasion
he
found
that
mr
brand
had
come
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
charming
stranger
but
after
acton
s
arrival
the
young
theologian
said
nothing
he
sat
in
his
chair
with
his
two
hands
clasped
fixing
upon
his
hostess
a
grave
fascinated
stare
the
baroness
talked
to
robert
acton
but
as
she
talked
she
turned
and
smiled
at
mr
brand
who
never
took
his
eyes
off
her
the
two
men
walked
away
together
they
were
going
to
wentworth
s
mr
brand
still
said
nothing
but
after
they
had
passed
into
wentworth
s
garden
he
stopped
and
looked
back
for
some
time
at
the
little
white
house
then
looking
at
his
companion
with
his
head
bent
a
little
to
one
side
and
his
eyes
somewhat
contracted
now
i
suppose
that
s
what
is
called
conversation
he
said
real
it
s
what
i
call
a
very
clever
woman
said
acton
laughing
it
is
most
interesting
mr
brand
continued
i
only
wish
she
would
speak
french
it
would
seem
more
in
keeping
it
must
be
quite
the
style
that
we
have
heard
about

we
have
read
about
the
style
of
conversation
of
madame

madame

looked
at

its
hollyhocks

like

a
couple
of
hours
later
she
came
over
to
the
great
house
to
tea
she
had
let
the
proposal
that
she
should
regularly
dine
there
fall
to
the
ground
she
was
in
the
enjoyment
of
whatever
satisfaction
was
to
be
derived
from
the
spectacle
of
an
old
negress
in
a
crimson
turban
shelling
peas
under
the
apple
trees
charlotte
who
had
provided
the
ancient
negress
thought
it
must
be
a
strange
household
eugenia
having
told
her
that
augustine
managed
everything
the
ancient
negress
included
augustine
who
was
naturally
devoid
of
all
acquaintance
with
the
expurgatory
english
tongue
by
far
the
most
immoral
sentiment
which
i
shall
have
occasion
to
attribute
to
charlotte
wentworth
was
a
certain
emotion
of
disappointment
at
finding
that
in
spite
of
these
irregular
conditions
the
domestic
arrangements
at
the
small
house
were
apparently
not
from
eugenia
s
peculiar
point
of
view
strikingly
offensive
the
baroness
found
it
amusing
to
go
to
tea
she
dressed
as
if
for
dinner
the
offered
an
anomalous
and
picturesque
repast
and
on
leaving
it
they
all
sat
and
talked
in
the
large
piazza
or
wandered
about
the
garden
in
the
starlight
with
their
ears
full
of
those
sounds
of
strange
insects
which
though
they
are
supposed
to
be
all
over
the
world
a
part
of
the
magic
of
summer
nights
seemed
to
the
baroness
to
have
beneath
these
western
skies
an
incomparable
resonance
wentworth
though
as
i
say
he
went
punctiliously
to
call
upon
her
was
not
able
to
feel
that
he
was
getting
used
to
his
niece
it
taxed
his
imagination
to
believe
that
she
was
really
his
s
child
his
sister
was
a
figure
of
his
early
years
she
had
been
only
twenty
when
she
went
abroad
never
to
return
making
in
foreign
parts
a
willful
and
undesirable
marriage
his
aunt
whiteside
who
had
taken
her
to
europe
for
the
benefit
of
the
tour
gave
on
her
return
so
lamentable
an
account
of
adolphus
young
to
whom
the
headstrong
girl
had
united
her
destiny
that
it
operated
as
a
chill
upon
family
feeling
especially
in
the
case
of
the
catherine
had
done
nothing
subsequently
to
propitiate
her
family
she
had
not
even
written
to
them
in
a
way
that
indicated
a
lucid
appreciation
of
their
suspended
sympathy
so
that
it
had
become
a
tradition
in
boston
circles
that
the
highest
charity
as
regards
this
young
lady
was
to
think
it
well
to
forget
her
and
to
abstain
from
conjecture
as
to
the
extent
to
which
her
aberrations
were
reproduced
in
her
descendants
over
these
young
people
a
vague
report
of
their
existence
had
come
to
his
ears
wentworth
had
not
in
the
course
of
years
allowed
his
imagination
to
hover
it
had
plenty
of
occupation
nearer
home
and
though
he
had
many
cares
upon
his
conscience
the
idea
that
he
had
been
an
unnatural
uncle
was
very
properly
never
among
the
number
now
that
his
nephew
and
niece
had
come
before
him
he
perceived
that
they
were
the
fruit
of
influences
and
circumstances
very
different
from
those
under
which
his
own
familiar
progeny
had
reached
a
maturity
he
felt
no
provocation
to
say
that
these
influences
had
been
exerted
for
evil
but
he
was
sometimes
afraid
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
like
his
distinguished
delicate
niece
he
was
paralyzed
and
bewildered
by
her
foreignness
she
spoke
somehow
a
different
language
there
was
something
strange
in
her
words
he
had
a
feeling
that
another
man
in
his
place
would
accommodate
himself
to
her
tone
would
ask
her
questions
and
joke
with
her
reply
to
those
pleasantries
of
her
own
which
sometimes
seemed
startling
as
addressed
to
an
uncle
but
wentworth
could
not
do
these
things
he
could
not
even
bring
himself
to
attempt
to
measure
her
position
in
the
world
she
was
the
wife
of
a
foreign
nobleman
who
desired
to
repudiate
her
this
had
a
singular
sound
but
the
old
man
felt
himself
destitute
of
the
materials
for
a
judgment
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
ought
to
find
them
in
his
own
experience
as
a
man
of
the
world
and
an
almost
public
character
but
they
were
not
there
and
he
was
ashamed
to
confess
to
himself
much
more
to
reveal
to
eugenia
by
interrogations
possibly
too
innocent
the
unfurnished
condition
of
this
repository
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
could
get
much
nearer
as
he
would
have
said
to
his
nephew
though
he
was
not
sure
that
felix
was
altogether
safe
he
was
so
bright
and
handsome
and
talkative
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
think
well
of
him
and
yet
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
something
almost
impudent
almost
vicious
or
as
if
there
ought
to
be
in
a
young
man
being
at
once
so
joyous
and
so
positive
it
was
to
be
observed
that
while
felix
was
not
at
all
a
serious
young
man
there
was
somehow
more
of
him
he
had
more
weight
and
volume
and
resonance
than
a
number
of
young
men
who
were
distinctly
serious
while
wentworth
meditated
upon
this
anomaly
his
nephew
was
admiring
him
unrestrictedly
he
thought
him
a
most
delicate
generous
old
gentleman
with
a
very
handsome
head
of
the
ascetic
type
which
he
promised
himself
the
profit
of
sketching
felix
was
far
from
having
made
a
secret
of
the
fact
that
he
wielded
the
and
it
was
not
his
own
fault
if
it
failed
to
be
generally
understood
that
he
was
prepared
to
execute
the
most
striking
likenesses
on
the
most
reasonable
terms
he
is
an
artist
my
cousin
is
an
artist
said
gertrude
and
she
offered
this
information
to
everyone
who
would
receive
it
she
offered
it
to
herself
as
it
were
by
way
of
admonition
and
reminder
she
repeated
to
herself
at
odd
moments
in
lonely
places
that
felix
was
invested
with
this
sacred
character
gertrude
had
never
seen
an
artist
before
she
had
only
read
about
such
people
they
seemed
to
her
a
romantic
and
mysterious
class
whose
life
was
made
up
of
those
agreeable
accidents
that
never
happened
to
other
persons
and
it
merely
quickened
her
meditations
on
this
point
that
felix
should
declare
as
he
repeatedly
did
that
he
was
really
not
an
artist
i
have
never
gone
into
the
thing
seriously
he
said
i
have
never
studied
i
have
had
no
training
i
do
a
little
of
everything
and
nothing
well
i
am
only
an
it
pleased
gertrude
even
more
to
think
that
he
was
an
amateur
than
to
think
that
he
was
an
artist
the
former
word
to
her
fancy
had
an
even
subtler
connotation
she
knew
however
that
it
was
a
word
to
use
more
soberly
wentworth
used
it
freely
for
though
he
had
not
been
exactly
familiar
with
it
he
found
it
convenient
as
a
help
toward
classifying
felix
who
as
a
young
man
extremely
clever
and
active
and
apparently
respectable
and
yet
not
engaged
in
any
recognized
business
was
an
importunate
anomaly
of
course
the
baroness
and
her
brother
she
was
always
spoken
of
first
were
a
welcome
topic
of
conversation
between
wentworth
and
his
daughters
and
their
occasional
visitors
and
the
young
man
your
nephew
what
is
his
profession
asked
an
old
gentleman
broderip
of
salem
who
had
been
wentworth
s
classmate
at
harvard
college
in
the
year
and
who
came
into
his
office
in
devonshire
street
wentworth
in
his
later
years
used
to
go
but
three
times
a
week
to
his
office
where
he
had
a
large
amount
of
highly
confidential
to
transact
well
he
s
an
amateur
said
felix
s
uncle
with
folded
hands
and
with
a
certain
satisfaction
in
being
able
to
say
it
and
broderip
had
gone
back
to
salem
with
a
feeling
that
this
was
probably
a
european
expression
for
a
broker
or
a
grain
exporter
i
should
like
to
do
your
head
sir
said
felix
to
his
uncle
one
evening
before
them
all
mr
brand
and
robert
acton
being
also
present
i
think
i
should
make
a
very
fine
thing
of
it
it
s
an
interesting
head
it
s
very
wentworth
looked
grave
he
felt
awkwardly
as
if
all
the
company
had
come
in
and
found
him
standing
before
the
the
lord
made
it
he
said
i
don
t
think
it
is
for
man
to
make
it
over
certainly
the
lord
made
it
replied
felix
laughing
and
he
made
it
very
well
but
life
has
been
touching
up
the
work
it
is
a
very
interesting
type
of
head
it
s
delightfully
wasted
and
emaciated
the
complexion
is
wonderfully
and
felix
looked
round
at
the
circle
as
if
to
call
their
attention
to
these
interesting
points
wentworth
grew
visibly
paler
i
should
like
to
do
you
as
an
old
prelate
an
old
cardinal
or
the
prior
of
an
a
prelate
a
cardinal
murmured
wentworth
do
you
refer
to
the
roman
catholic
priesthood
i
mean
an
old
ecclesiastic
who
should
have
led
a
very
pure
abstinent
life
now
i
take
it
that
has
been
the
case
with
you
sir
one
sees
it
in
your
face
felix
proceeded
you
have
been
very
a
very
moderate
don
t
you
think
one
always
sees
that
in
a
man
s
face
you
see
more
in
a
man
s
face
than
i
should
think
of
looking
for
said
wentworth
coldly
the
baroness
rattled
her
fan
and
gave
her
brilliant
laugh
it
is
a
risk
to
look
so
close
she
exclaimed
my
uncle
has
some
peccadilloes
on
his
wentworth
looked
at
her
painfully
at
a
loss
and
in
so
far
as
the
signs
of
a
pure
and
abstinent
life
were
visible
in
his
face
they
were
then
probably
peculiarly
manifest
you
are
a
dear
uncle
said
madame
münster
smiling
with
her
foreign
eyes
i
think
you
are
paying
me
a
compliment
said
the
old
man
surely
i
am
not
the
first
woman
that
ever
did
so
cried
the
baroness
i
think
you
are
said
wentworth
gravely
and
turning
to
felix
he
added
in
the
same
tone
please
don
t
take
my
likeness
my
children
have
my
daguerreotype
that
is
quite
i
won
t
promise
said
felix
not
to
work
your
head
into
something
wentworth
looked
at
him
and
then
at
all
the
others
then
he
got
up
and
slowly
walked
away
felix
said
gertrude
in
the
silence
that
followed
i
wish
you
would
paint
my
charlotte
wondered
whether
gertrude
was
right
in
wishing
this
and
she
looked
at
mr
brand
as
the
most
legitimate
way
of
ascertaining
whatever
gertrude
did
or
said
charlotte
always
looked
at
mr
brand
it
was
a
standing
pretext
for
looking
at
mr
brand
always
as
charlotte
thought
in
the
interest
of
gertrude
s
welfare
it
is
true
that
she
felt
a
tremulous
interest
in
gertrude
being
right
for
charlotte
in
her
small
still
way
was
an
heroic
sister
we
should
be
glad
to
have
your
portrait
miss
gertrude
said
mr
brand
i
should
be
delighted
to
paint
so
charming
a
model
felix
declared
do
you
think
you
are
so
lovely
my
dear
asked
lizzie
acton
with
her
little
inoffensive
pertness
biting
off
a
knot
in
her
knitting
it
is
not
because
i
think
i
am
beautiful
said
gertrude
looking
all
round
i
don
t
think
i
am
beautiful
at
she
spoke
with
a
sort
of
conscious
deliberateness
and
it
seemed
very
strange
to
charlotte
to
hear
her
discussing
this
question
so
publicly
it
is
because
i
think
it
would
be
amusing
to
sit
and
be
painted
i
have
always
thought
i
am
sorry
you
have
not
had
better
things
to
think
about
my
daughter
said
wentworth
you
are
very
beautiful
cousin
gertrude
felix
declared
that
s
a
compliment
said
gertrude
i
put
all
the
compliments
i
receive
into
a
little
that
has
a
slit
in
the
side
i
shake
them
up
and
down
and
they
rattle
there
are
not
many
yet
only
two
or
no
it
s
not
a
compliment
felix
rejoined
see
i
am
careful
not
to
give
it
the
form
of
a
compliment
i
didn
t
think
you
were
beautiful
at
first
but
you
have
come
to
seem
so
little
by
take
care
now
your
jug
doesn
t
burst
exclaimed
lizzie
i
think
sitting
for
one
s
portrait
is
only
one
of
the
various
forms
of
idleness
said
wentworth
their
name
is
my
dear
sir
cried
felix
you
can
t
be
said
to
be
idle
when
you
are
making
a
man
work
so
one
might
be
painted
while
one
is
asleep
suggested
mr
brand
as
a
contribution
to
the
discussion
ah
do
paint
me
while
i
am
asleep
said
gertrude
to
felix
smiling
and
she
closed
her
eyes
a
little
it
had
by
this
time
become
a
matter
of
almost
exciting
anxiety
to
charlotte
what
gertrude
would
say
or
would
do
next
she
began
to
sit
for
her
portrait
on
the
following
day
in
the
open
air
on
the
north
side
of
the
piazza
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
you
think
of
us
how
we
seem
to
you
she
said
to
felix
as
he
sat
before
his
easel
you
seem
to
me
the
best
people
in
the
world
said
felix
you
say
that
gertrude
resumed
because
it
saves
you
the
trouble
of
saying
anything
the
young
man
glanced
at
her
over
the
top
of
his
canvas
what
else
should
i
say
it
would
certainly
be
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
say
anything
well
said
gertrude
you
have
seen
people
before
that
you
have
liked
have
you
not
indeed
i
have
thank
heaven
and
they
have
been
very
different
from
us
gertrude
went
on
that
only
proves
said
felix
that
there
are
a
thousand
different
ways
of
being
good
do
you
think
us
good
company
asked
gertrude
company
for
a
king
gertrude
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
there
must
be
a
thousand
different
ways
of
being
dreary
she
said
and
sometimes
i
think
we
make
use
of
them
felix
stood
up
quickly
holding
up
his
hand
if
you
could
only
keep
that
look
on
your
face
for
half
an
hour
while
i
catch
it
he
said
it
is
uncommonly
to
look
handsome
for
half
an
hour
that
is
a
great
deal
to
ask
of
me
she
answered
it
would
be
the
portrait
of
a
young
woman
who
has
taken
some
vow
some
pledge
that
she
repents
of
said
felix
and
who
is
thinking
it
over
at
i
have
taken
no
vow
no
pledge
said
gertrude
very
gravely
i
have
nothing
to
repent
my
dear
cousin
that
was
only
a
figure
of
speech
i
am
very
sure
that
no
one
in
your
excellent
family
has
anything
to
repent
and
yet
we
are
always
repenting
gertrude
exclaimed
that
is
what
i
mean
by
our
being
dreary
you
know
it
perfectly
well
you
only
pretend
that
you
don
felix
gave
a
quick
laugh
the
half
hour
is
going
on
and
yet
you
are
handsomer
than
ever
one
must
be
careful
what
one
says
you
to
me
said
gertrude
you
can
say
felix
looked
at
her
as
an
artist
might
and
painted
for
some
time
in
silence
yes
you
seem
to
me
different
from
your
father
and
sister
from
most
of
the
people
you
have
lived
with
he
observed
to
say
that
one
s
self
gertrude
went
on
is
like
saying
by
implication
at
least
that
one
is
better
i
am
not
better
i
am
much
worse
but
they
say
themselves
that
i
am
different
it
makes
them
since
you
accuse
me
of
concealing
my
real
impressions
i
may
admit
that
i
think
the
tendency
among
you
generally
is
to
be
made
unhappy
too
i
wish
you
would
tell
that
to
my
father
said
gertrude
it
might
make
him
more
unhappy
felix
exclaimed
laughing
it
certainly
would
i
don
t
believe
you
have
seen
people
like
ah
my
dear
cousin
how
do
you
know
what
i
have
seen
felix
demanded
how
can
i
tell
you
you
might
tell
me
a
great
many
things
if
you
only
would
you
have
seen
people
like
yourself
people
who
are
bright
and
gay
and
fond
of
amusement
we
are
not
fond
of
yes
said
felix
i
confess
that
rather
strikes
me
you
don
t
seem
to
me
to
get
all
the
pleasure
out
of
life
that
you
might
you
don
t
seem
to
me
to
enjoy
do
you
mind
my
saying
this
he
asked
pausing
please
go
on
said
the
girl
earnestly
you
seem
to
me
very
well
placed
for
enjoying
you
have
money
and
liberty
and
what
is
called
in
europe
a
but
you
take
a
painful
view
of
life
as
one
may
one
ought
to
think
it
bright
and
charming
and
delightful
eh
asked
gertrude
i
should
say
so
if
one
can
it
is
true
it
all
depends
upon
that
felix
added
you
know
there
is
a
great
deal
of
misery
in
the
world
said
his
model
i
have
seen
a
little
of
it
the
young
man
rejoined
but
it
was
all
over
there
beyond
the
sea
i
don
t
see
any
here
this
is
a
gertrude
said
nothing
she
sat
looking
at
the
dahlias
and
the
in
the
garden
while
felix
went
on
with
his
work
to
enjoy
she
began
at
last
to
take
life
not
painfully
must
one
do
something
wrong
felix
gave
his
long
light
laugh
again
seriously
i
think
not
and
for
this
reason
among
others
you
strike
me
as
very
capable
of
enjoying
if
the
chance
were
given
you
and
yet
at
the
same
time
as
incapable
of
i
am
sure
said
gertrude
that
you
are
very
wrong
in
telling
a
person
that
she
is
incapable
of
that
we
are
never
nearer
to
evil
than
when
we
believe
you
are
handsomer
than
ever
observed
felix
irrelevantly
gertrude
had
got
used
to
hearing
him
say
this
there
was
not
so
much
excitement
in
it
as
at
first
what
ought
one
to
do
she
continued
to
give
parties
to
go
to
the
theatre
to
read
novels
to
keep
late
hours
i
don
t
think
it
s
what
one
does
or
one
doesn
t
do
that
promotes
enjoyment
her
companion
answered
it
is
the
general
way
of
looking
at
they
look
at
it
as
a
discipline
that
s
what
they
do
here
i
have
often
been
told
well
that
s
very
good
but
there
is
another
way
added
felix
smiling
to
look
at
it
as
an
an
opportunity
yes
said
gertrude
one
would
get
more
pleasure
that
i
don
t
attempt
to
say
anything
better
for
it
than
that
it
has
been
my
own
way
and
that
is
not
saying
much
felix
had
laid
down
his
palette
and
brushes
he
was
leaning
back
with
his
arms
folded
to
judge
the
effect
of
his
work
and
you
know
he
said
i
am
a
very
petty
you
have
a
great
deal
of
talent
said
gertrude
no
no
the
young
man
rejoined
in
a
tone
of
cheerful
impartiality
i
have
not
a
great
deal
of
talent
it
is
nothing
at
all
remarkable
i
assure
you
i
should
know
if
it
were
i
shall
always
be
obscure
the
world
will
never
hear
of
gertrude
looked
at
him
with
a
strange
feeling
she
was
thinking
of
the
great
world
which
he
knew
and
which
she
did
not
and
how
full
of
brilliant
talents
it
must
be
since
it
could
afford
to
make
light
of
his
abilities
you
needn
t
in
general
attach
much
importance
to
anything
i
tell
you
he
pursued
but
you
may
believe
me
when
i
say
this
that
i
am
little
better
than
a
a
she
repeated
i
am
a
species
of
a
bohemian
gertrude
had
never
heard
this
term
before
save
as
a
geographical
denomination
and
she
quite
failed
to
understand
the
figurative
meaning
which
her
companion
appeared
to
attach
to
it
but
it
gave
her
pleasure
felix
had
pushed
back
his
chair
and
risen
to
his
feet
he
slowly
came
toward
her
smiling
i
am
a
sort
of
adventurer
he
said
looking
down
at
her
she
got
up
meeting
his
smile
an
adventurer
she
repeated
i
should
like
to
hear
your
for
an
instant
she
believed
that
he
was
going
to
take
her
hand
but
he
dropped
his
own
hands
suddenly
into
the
pockets
of
his
there
is
no
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
he
said
i
have
been
an
adventurer
but
my
adventures
have
been
very
innocent
they
have
all
been
happy
ones
i
don
t
think
there
are
any
i
shouldn
t
tell
they
were
very
pleasant
and
very
pretty
i
should
like
to
go
over
them
in
memory
sit
down
again
and
i
will
begin
he
added
in
a
moment
with
his
naturally
persuasive
smile
gertrude
sat
down
again
on
that
day
and
she
sat
down
on
several
other
days
felix
while
he
plied
his
brush
told
her
a
great
many
stories
and
she
listened
with
charmed
avidity
her
eyes
rested
upon
his
lips
she
was
very
serious
sometimes
from
her
air
of
wondering
gravity
he
thought
she
was
displeased
but
felix
never
believed
for
more
than
a
single
moment
in
any
displeasure
of
his
own
producing
this
would
have
been
fatuity
if
the
optimism
it
expressed
had
not
been
much
more
a
hope
than
a
prejudice
it
is
beside
the
matter
to
say
that
he
had
a
good
conscience
for
the
best
conscience
is
a
sort
of
and
this
young
man
s
brilliantly
healthy
nature
spent
itself
in
objective
good
intentions
which
were
ignorant
of
any
test
save
exactness
in
hitting
their
mark
he
told
gertrude
how
he
had
walked
over
france
and
italy
with
a
painter
s
knapsack
on
his
back
paying
his
way
often
by
knocking
off
a
flattering
portrait
of
his
host
or
hostess
he
told
her
how
he
had
played
the
violin
in
a
little
band
of
musicians
not
of
high
celebrity
who
traveled
through
foreign
lands
giving
provincial
concerts
he
told
her
also
how
he
had
been
a
momentary
ornament
of
a
troupe
of
strolling
actors
engaged
in
the
arduous
task
of
interpreting
shakespeare
to
french
and
german
polish
and
hungarian
audiences
while
this
periodical
recital
was
going
on
gertrude
lived
in
a
fantastic
world
she
seemed
to
herself
to
be
reading
a
romance
that
came
out
in
daily
numbers
she
had
known
nothing
so
delightful
since
the
perusal
of
one
afternoon
she
went
to
see
her
cousin
acton
robert
s
mother
who
was
a
great
invalid
never
leaving
the
house
she
came
back
alone
on
foot
across
the
fields
this
being
a
short
way
which
they
often
used
felix
had
gone
to
boston
with
her
father
who
desired
to
take
the
young
man
to
call
upon
some
of
his
friends
old
gentlemen
who
remembered
his
mother
remembered
her
but
said
nothing
about
her
and
several
of
whom
with
the
gentle
ladies
their
wives
had
driven
out
from
town
to
pay
their
respects
at
the
little
house
among
the
apple
trees
in
vehicles
which
reminded
the
baroness
who
received
her
visitors
with
discriminating
civility
of
the
large
light
rattling
barouche
in
which
she
herself
had
made
her
journey
to
this
neighborhood
the
afternoon
was
waning
in
the
western
sky
the
great
picture
of
a
new
england
sunset
painted
in
crimson
and
silver
was
suspended
from
the
zenith
and
the
stony
pastures
as
gertrude
traversed
them
thinking
intently
to
herself
were
covered
with
a
light
clear
glow
at
the
open
gate
of
one
of
the
fields
she
saw
from
the
distance
a
man
s
figure
he
stood
there
as
if
he
were
waiting
for
her
and
as
she
came
nearer
she
recognized
mr
brand
she
had
a
feeling
as
of
not
having
seen
him
for
some
time
she
could
not
have
said
for
how
long
for
it
yet
seemed
to
her
that
he
had
been
very
lately
at
the
house
may
i
walk
back
with
you
he
asked
and
when
she
had
said
that
he
might
if
he
wanted
he
observed
that
he
had
seen
her
and
recognized
her
half
a
mile
away
you
must
have
very
good
eyes
said
gertrude
yes
i
have
very
good
eyes
miss
gertrude
said
mr
brand
she
perceived
that
he
meant
something
but
for
a
long
time
past
mr
brand
had
constantly
meant
something
and
she
had
almost
got
used
to
it
she
felt
however
that
what
he
meant
had
now
a
renewed
power
to
disturb
her
to
perplex
and
agitate
her
he
walked
beside
her
in
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
he
added
i
have
had
no
trouble
in
seeing
that
you
are
beginning
to
avoid
me
but
perhaps
he
went
on
one
needn
t
have
had
very
good
eyes
to
see
i
have
not
avoided
you
said
gertrude
without
looking
at
him
i
think
you
have
been
unconscious
that
you
were
avoiding
me
mr
brand
replied
you
have
not
even
known
that
i
was
well
you
are
here
now
mr
brand
said
gertrude
with
a
little
laugh
i
know
that
very
he
made
no
rejoinder
he
simply
walked
beside
her
slowly
as
they
were
obliged
to
walk
over
the
soft
grass
presently
they
came
to
another
gate
which
was
closed
mr
brand
laid
his
hand
upon
it
but
he
made
no
movement
to
open
it
he
stood
and
looked
at
his
companion
you
are
very
much
interested
very
much
absorbed
he
said
gertrude
glanced
at
him
she
saw
that
he
was
pale
and
that
he
looked
excited
she
had
never
seen
mr
brand
excited
before
and
she
felt
that
the
spectacle
if
fully
carried
out
would
be
impressive
almost
painful
absorbed
in
what
she
asked
then
she
looked
away
at
the
illuminated
sky
she
felt
guilty
and
uncomfortable
and
yet
she
was
vexed
with
herself
for
feeling
so
but
mr
brand
as
he
stood
there
looking
at
her
with
his
small
kind
persistent
eyes
represented
an
immense
body
of
obligations
that
were
rising
again
into
a
certain
distinctness
you
have
new
interests
new
occupations
he
went
on
i
don
t
know
that
i
can
say
that
you
have
new
duties
we
have
always
old
ones
gertrude
he
added
please
open
the
gate
brand
she
said
and
she
felt
as
if
in
saying
so
she
were
cowardly
and
petulant
but
he
opened
the
gate
and
allowed
her
to
pass
then
he
closed
it
behind
himself
before
she
had
time
to
turn
away
he
put
out
his
hand
and
held
her
an
instant
by
the
wrist
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
he
said
i
know
what
you
want
to
say
she
answered
and
she
was
on
the
point
of
adding
and
i
know
just
how
you
will
say
it
but
these
words
she
kept
back
i
love
you
gertrude
he
said
i
love
you
very
much
i
love
you
more
than
he
said
the
words
just
as
she
had
known
he
would
she
had
heard
them
before
they
had
no
charm
for
her
she
had
said
to
herself
before
that
it
was
very
strange
it
was
supposed
to
be
delightful
for
a
woman
to
listen
to
such
words
but
these
seemed
to
her
flat
and
mechanical
i
wish
you
would
forget
that
she
declared
how
can
i
why
should
i
he
asked
i
have
made
you
no
promise
given
you
no
pledge
she
said
looking
at
him
with
her
voice
trembling
a
little
you
have
let
me
feel
that
i
have
an
influence
over
you
you
have
opened
your
mind
to
i
never
opened
my
mind
to
you
mr
brand
gertrude
cried
with
some
vehemence
then
you
were
not
so
frank
as
i
thought
as
we
all
i
don
t
see
what
anyone
else
had
to
do
with
it
cried
the
girl
i
mean
your
father
and
your
sister
you
know
it
makes
them
happy
to
think
you
will
listen
to
she
gave
a
little
laugh
it
doesn
t
make
them
happy
she
said
nothing
makes
them
happy
no
one
is
happy
i
think
your
cousin
is
very
happy
young
rejoined
mr
brand
in
a
soft
almost
timid
tone
so
much
the
better
for
him
and
gertrude
gave
her
little
laugh
again
the
young
man
looked
at
her
a
moment
you
are
very
much
changed
he
said
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
gertrude
declared
i
am
not
i
have
known
you
a
long
time
and
i
have
loved
you
as
you
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
said
gertrude
i
must
be
going
he
on
his
side
gave
a
little
laugh
you
certainly
do
avoid
me
you
see
avoid
me
then
said
the
girl
he
looked
at
her
again
and
then
very
gently
no
i
will
not
avoid
you
he
replied
but
i
will
leave
you
for
the
present
to
yourself
i
think
you
will
remember
after
a
while
some
of
the
things
you
have
forgotten
i
think
you
will
come
back
to
me
i
have
great
faith
in
this
time
his
voice
was
very
touching
there
was
a
strong
reproachful
force
in
what
he
said
and
gertrude
could
answer
nothing
he
turned
away
and
stood
there
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
gate
and
looking
at
the
beautiful
sunset
gertrude
left
him
and
took
her
way
home
again
but
when
she
reached
the
middle
of
the
next
field
she
suddenly
burst
into
tears
her
tears
seemed
to
her
to
have
been
a
long
time
gathering
and
for
some
moments
it
was
a
kind
of
glee
to
shed
them
but
they
presently
passed
away
there
was
something
a
little
hard
about
gertrude
and
she
never
wept
again
chapter
vi
going
of
an
afternoon
to
call
upon
his
niece
wentworth
more
than
once
found
robert
acton
sitting
in
her
little
this
was
in
no
degree
to
wentworth
a
perturbing
fact
for
he
had
no
sense
of
competing
with
his
young
kinsman
for
eugenia
s
good
graces
madame
münster
s
uncle
had
the
highest
opinion
of
robert
acton
who
indeed
in
the
family
at
large
was
the
object
of
a
great
deal
of
undemonstrative
appreciation
they
were
all
proud
of
him
in
so
far
as
the
charge
of
being
proud
may
be
brought
against
people
who
were
habitually
distinctly
guiltless
of
the
misdemeanor
known
as
taking
they
never
boasted
of
robert
acton
nor
indulged
in
vainglorious
reference
to
him
they
never
quoted
the
clever
things
he
had
said
nor
mentioned
the
generous
things
he
had
done
but
a
sort
of
faith
in
his
unlimited
goodness
was
a
part
of
their
personal
sense
of
right
and
there
can
perhaps
be
no
better
proof
of
the
high
esteem
in
which
he
was
held
than
the
fact
that
no
explicit
judgment
was
ever
passed
upon
his
actions
he
was
no
more
praised
than
he
was
blamed
but
he
was
tacitly
felt
to
be
an
ornament
to
his
circle
he
was
the
man
of
the
world
of
the
family
he
had
been
to
china
and
brought
home
a
collection
of
curiosities
he
had
made
a
fortune
or
rather
he
had
quintupled
a
fortune
already
considerable
he
was
distinguished
by
that
combination
of
celibacy
property
and
good
humor
which
appeals
to
even
the
most
subdued
imaginations
and
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
he
would
presently
place
these
advantages
at
the
disposal
of
some
young
woman
of
his
own
wentworth
was
not
a
man
to
admit
to
himself
that
his
paternal
duties
apart
he
liked
any
individual
much
better
than
all
other
individuals
but
he
thought
robert
acton
extremely
judicious
and
this
was
perhaps
as
near
an
approach
as
he
was
capable
of
to
the
eagerness
of
preference
which
his
temperament
repudiated
as
it
would
have
disengaged
itself
from
something
slightly
unchaste
acton
was
in
fact
very
judicious
and
something
more
beside
and
indeed
it
must
be
claimed
for
wentworth
that
in
the
more
illicit
parts
of
his
preference
there
hovered
the
vague
adumbration
of
a
belief
that
his
cousin
s
final
merit
was
a
certain
enviable
capacity
for
whistling
rather
gallantly
at
the
sanctions
of
mere
judgment
for
showing
a
larger
courage
a
finer
quality
of
pluck
than
common
occasion
demanded
wentworth
would
never
have
risked
the
intimation
that
acton
was
made
in
the
smallest
degree
of
the
stuff
of
a
hero
but
this
is
small
blame
to
him
for
robert
would
certainly
never
have
risked
it
himself
acton
certainly
exercised
great
discretion
in
all
things
beginning
with
his
estimate
of
himself
he
knew
that
he
was
by
no
means
so
much
of
a
man
of
the
world
as
he
was
supposed
to
be
in
local
circles
but
it
must
be
added
that
he
knew
also
that
his
natural
shrewdness
had
a
reach
of
which
he
had
never
quite
given
local
circles
the
measure
he
was
addicted
to
taking
the
humorous
view
of
things
and
he
had
discovered
that
even
in
the
narrowest
circles
such
a
disposition
may
find
frequent
opportunities
such
opportunities
had
formed
for
some
time
that
is
since
his
return
from
china
a
year
and
a
half
before
the
most
active
element
in
this
gentleman
s
life
which
had
just
now
a
rather
indolent
air
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
get
married
he
was
very
fond
of
books
and
he
had
a
handsome
library
that
is
his
books
were
much
more
numerous
than
wentworth
s
he
was
also
very
fond
of
pictures
but
it
must
be
confessed
in
the
fierce
light
of
contemporary
criticism
that
his
walls
were
adorned
with
several
rather
abortive
masterpieces
he
had
got
his
learning
and
there
was
more
of
it
than
commonly
appeared
at
harvard
college
and
he
took
a
pleasure
in
old
associations
which
made
it
a
part
of
his
daily
contentment
to
live
so
near
this
institution
that
he
often
passed
it
in
driving
to
boston
he
was
extremely
interested
in
the
baroness
münster
she
was
very
frank
with
him
or
at
least
she
intended
to
be
i
am
sure
you
find
it
very
strange
that
i
should
have
settled
down
in
this
part
of
the
world
she
said
to
him
three
or
four
weeks
after
she
had
installed
herself
i
am
certain
you
are
wondering
about
my
motives
they
are
very
the
baroness
by
this
time
was
an
old
inhabitant
the
best
society
in
boston
had
called
upon
her
and
clifford
wentworth
had
taken
her
several
times
to
drive
in
his
buggy
robert
acton
was
seated
near
her
playing
with
a
fan
there
were
always
several
fans
lying
about
her
with
long
ribbons
of
different
colors
attached
to
them
and
acton
was
always
playing
with
one
no
i
don
t
find
it
at
all
strange
he
said
slowly
smiling
that
a
clever
woman
should
turn
up
in
boston
or
its
suburbs
that
does
not
require
so
much
explanation
boston
is
a
very
nice
if
you
wish
to
make
me
contradict
you
said
the
baroness
vous
y
prenez
in
certain
moods
there
is
nothing
i
am
not
capable
of
agreeing
to
boston
is
a
paradise
and
we
are
in
the
suburbs
of
just
now
i
am
not
at
all
in
the
suburbs
i
am
in
the
place
itself
rejoined
acton
who
was
lounging
a
little
in
his
chair
he
was
however
not
always
lounging
and
when
he
was
he
was
not
quite
so
relaxed
as
he
pretended
to
a
certain
extent
he
sought
refuge
from
shyness
in
this
appearance
of
relaxation
and
like
many
persons
in
the
same
circumstances
he
somewhat
exaggerated
the
appearance
beyond
this
the
air
of
being
much
at
his
ease
was
a
cover
for
vigilant
observation
he
was
more
than
interested
in
this
clever
woman
who
whatever
he
might
say
was
clever
not
at
all
after
the
boston
fashion
she
plunged
him
into
a
kind
of
excitement
held
him
in
vague
suspense
he
was
obliged
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
had
never
yet
seen
a
woman
just
like
this
not
even
in
china
he
was
ashamed
for
inscrutable
reasons
of
the
vivacity
of
his
emotion
and
he
carried
it
off
superficially
by
taking
still
superficially
the
humorous
view
of
madame
münster
it
was
not
at
all
true
that
he
thought
it
very
natural
of
her
to
have
made
this
pious
pilgrimage
it
might
have
been
said
of
him
in
advance
that
he
was
too
good
a
bostonian
to
regard
in
the
light
of
an
eccentricity
the
desire
of
even
the
remotest
alien
to
visit
the
new
england
metropolis
this
was
an
impulse
for
which
surely
no
apology
was
needed
and
madame
münster
was
the
fortunate
possessor
of
several
new
england
cousins
in
fact
however
madame
münster
struck
him
as
out
of
keeping
with
her
little
circle
she
was
at
the
best
a
very
agreeable
a
gracefully
mystifying
anomaly
he
knew
very
well
that
it
would
not
do
to
address
these
reflections
too
crudely
to
wentworth
he
would
never
have
remarked
to
the
old
gentleman
that
he
wondered
what
the
baroness
was
up
to
and
indeed
he
had
no
great
desire
to
share
his
vague
mistrust
with
anyone
there
was
a
personal
pleasure
in
it
the
greatest
pleasure
he
had
known
at
least
since
he
had
come
from
china
he
would
keep
the
baroness
for
better
or
worse
to
himself
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
deserved
to
enjoy
a
monopoly
of
her
for
he
was
certainly
the
person
who
had
most
adequately
gauged
her
capacity
for
social
intercourse
before
long
it
became
apparent
to
him
that
the
baroness
was
disposed
to
lay
no
tax
upon
such
a
monopoly
one
day
he
was
sitting
there
again
and
playing
with
a
fan
she
asked
him
to
apologize
should
the
occasion
present
itself
to
certain
people
in
boston
for
her
not
having
returned
their
calls
there
are
half
a
dozen
places
she
said
a
formidable
list
charlotte
wentworth
has
written
it
out
for
me
in
a
terrifically
distinct
hand
there
is
no
ambiguity
on
the
subject
i
know
perfectly
where
i
must
go
wentworth
informs
me
that
the
carriage
is
always
at
my
disposal
and
charlotte
offers
to
go
with
me
in
a
pair
of
tight
gloves
and
a
very
stiff
petticoat
and
yet
for
three
days
i
have
been
putting
it
off
they
must
think
me
horribly
you
ask
me
to
apologize
said
acton
but
you
don
t
tell
me
what
excuse
i
can
that
is
more
the
baroness
declared
than
i
am
held
to
it
would
be
like
my
asking
you
to
buy
me
a
bouquet
and
giving
you
the
money
i
have
no
reason
except
that
somehow
it
s
too
violent
an
effort
it
is
not
inspiring
wouldn
t
that
serve
as
an
excuse
in
boston
i
am
told
they
are
very
sincere
they
don
t
tell
fibs
and
then
felix
ought
to
go
with
me
and
he
is
never
in
readiness
i
don
t
see
him
he
is
always
roaming
about
the
fields
and
sketching
old
barns
or
taking
walks
or
painting
someone
s
portrait
or
rowing
on
the
pond
or
flirting
with
gertrude
i
should
think
it
would
amuse
you
to
go
and
see
a
few
people
said
acton
you
are
having
a
very
quiet
time
of
it
here
it
s
a
dull
life
for
ah
the
quiet
the
quiet
the
baroness
exclaimed
that
s
what
i
like
it
s
rest
that
s
what
i
came
here
for
amusement
i
have
had
amusement
and
as
for
seeing
people
i
have
already
seen
a
great
many
in
my
life
if
it
didn
t
sound
ungracious
i
should
say
that
i
wish
very
humbly
your
people
here
would
leave
me
alone
acton
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
she
looked
at
him
she
was
a
woman
who
took
being
looked
at
remarkably
well
so
you
have
come
here
for
rest
he
asked
so
i
may
say
i
came
for
many
of
those
reasons
that
are
no
reasons
don
t
you
know
and
yet
that
are
really
the
best
to
come
away
to
change
to
break
with
everything
when
once
one
comes
away
one
must
arrive
somewhere
and
i
asked
myself
why
i
shouldn
t
arrive
you
certainly
had
time
on
the
way
said
acton
laughing
madame
münster
looked
at
him
again
and
then
smiling
and
i
have
certainly
had
time
since
i
got
here
to
ask
myself
why
i
came
however
i
never
ask
myself
idle
questions
here
i
am
and
it
seems
to
me
you
ought
only
to
thank
when
you
go
away
you
will
see
the
difficulties
i
shall
put
in
your
you
mean
to
put
difficulties
in
my
path
she
asked
rearranging
the
rosebud
in
her
corsage
the
greatest
of
all
that
of
having
been
so
agreeable
that
i
shall
be
unable
to
depart
don
t
be
too
sure
i
have
left
some
very
agreeable
people
over
ah
said
acton
but
it
was
to
come
here
where
i
am
i
didn
t
know
of
your
existence
excuse
me
for
saying
anything
so
rude
but
honestly
speaking
i
did
not
no
the
baroness
pursued
it
was
precisely
not
to
see
you
such
people
as
you
that
i
such
people
as
me
cried
acton
i
had
a
sort
of
longing
to
come
into
those
natural
relations
which
i
knew
i
should
find
here
over
there
i
had
only
as
i
may
say
artificial
relations
don
t
you
see
the
difference
the
difference
tells
against
me
said
acton
i
suppose
i
am
an
artificial
conventional
declared
the
baroness
very
well
there
is
one
way
in
which
the
relation
of
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
may
always
become
natural
said
acton
you
mean
by
their
becoming
lovers
that
may
be
natural
or
not
and
at
any
rate
rejoined
eugenia
nous
n
en
sommes
pas
là
they
were
not
as
yet
but
a
little
later
when
she
began
to
go
with
him
to
drive
it
might
almost
have
seemed
that
they
were
he
came
for
her
several
times
alone
in
his
high
wagon
drawn
by
a
pair
of
charming
horses
it
was
different
her
having
gone
with
clifford
wentworth
who
was
her
cousin
and
so
much
younger
it
was
not
to
be
imagined
that
she
should
have
a
flirtation
with
clifford
who
was
a
mere
boy
and
whom
a
large
section
of
boston
society
supposed
to
be
engaged
to
lizzie
acton
not
indeed
that
it
was
to
be
conceived
that
the
baroness
was
a
possible
party
to
any
flirtation
whatever
for
she
was
undoubtedly
a
married
lady
it
was
generally
known
that
her
matrimonial
condition
was
of
the
morganatic
order
but
in
its
natural
aversion
to
suppose
that
this
meant
anything
less
than
absolute
wedlock
the
conscience
of
the
community
took
refuge
in
the
belief
that
it
implied
something
even
more
acton
wished
her
to
think
highly
of
american
scenery
and
he
drove
her
to
great
distances
picking
out
the
prettiest
roads
and
the
largest
points
of
view
if
we
are
good
when
we
are
contented
eugenia
s
virtues
should
now
certainly
have
been
uppermost
for
she
found
a
charm
in
the
rapid
movement
through
a
wild
country
and
in
a
companion
who
from
time
to
time
made
the
vehicle
dip
with
a
motion
like
a
swallow
s
flight
over
roads
of
primitive
construction
and
who
as
she
felt
would
do
a
great
many
things
that
she
might
ask
him
sometimes
for
a
couple
of
hours
together
there
were
almost
no
houses
there
were
nothing
but
woods
and
rivers
and
lakes
and
horizons
adorned
with
mountains
it
seemed
to
the
baroness
very
wild
as
i
have
said
and
lovely
but
the
impression
added
something
to
that
sense
of
the
enlargement
of
opportunity
which
had
been
born
of
her
arrival
in
the
new
world
one
day
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
acton
pulled
up
his
horses
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
which
commanded
a
beautiful
prospect
he
let
them
stand
a
long
time
to
rest
while
he
sat
there
and
talked
with
madame
münster
the
prospect
was
beautiful
in
spite
of
there
being
nothing
human
within
sight
there
was
a
wilderness
of
woods
and
the
gleam
of
a
distant
river
and
a
glimpse
of
half
the
in
massachusetts
the
road
had
a
wide
grassy
margin
on
the
further
side
of
which
there
flowed
a
deep
clear
brook
there
were
wild
flowers
in
the
grass
and
beside
the
brook
lay
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
acton
waited
a
while
at
last
a
rustic
wayfarer
came
trudging
along
the
road
acton
asked
him
to
hold
the
horses
a
service
he
consented
to
render
as
a
friendly
turn
to
a
then
he
invited
the
baroness
to
descend
and
the
two
wandered
away
across
the
grass
and
sat
down
on
the
log
beside
the
brook
i
imagine
it
doesn
t
remind
you
of
silberstadt
said
acton
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
mentioned
silberstadt
to
her
for
particular
reasons
he
knew
she
had
a
husband
there
and
this
was
disagreeable
to
him
and
furthermore
it
had
been
repeated
to
him
that
this
husband
wished
to
put
her
away
a
state
of
affairs
to
which
even
indirect
reference
was
to
be
deprecated
it
was
true
nevertheless
that
the
baroness
herself
had
often
alluded
to
silberstadt
and
acton
had
often
wondered
why
her
husband
wished
to
get
rid
of
her
it
was
a
curious
position
for
a
lady
this
being
known
as
a
repudiated
wife
and
it
is
worthy
of
observation
that
the
baroness
carried
it
off
with
exceeding
grace
and
dignity
she
had
made
it
felt
from
the
first
that
there
were
two
sides
to
the
question
and
that
her
own
side
when
she
should
choose
to
present
it
would
be
replete
with
touching
interest
it
does
not
remind
me
of
the
town
of
course
she
said
of
the
sculptured
gables
and
the
gothic
churches
of
the
wonderful
schloss
with
its
moat
and
its
clustering
towers
but
it
has
a
little
look
of
some
other
parts
of
the
principality
one
might
fancy
one
s
self
among
those
grand
old
german
forests
those
legendary
mountains
the
sort
of
country
one
sees
from
the
windows
at
what
is
schreckenstein
asked
acton
it
is
a
great
castle
the
summer
residence
of
the
reigning
have
you
ever
lived
there
i
have
stayed
there
said
the
baroness
acton
was
silent
he
looked
a
while
at
the
uncastled
landscape
before
him
it
is
the
first
time
you
have
ever
asked
me
about
silberstadt
she
said
i
should
think
you
would
want
to
know
about
my
marriage
it
must
seem
to
you
very
acton
looked
at
her
a
moment
now
you
wouldn
t
like
me
to
say
that
you
americans
have
such
odd
ways
the
baroness
declared
you
never
ask
anything
outright
there
seem
to
be
so
many
things
you
can
t
talk
we
americans
are
very
polite
said
acton
whose
national
consciousness
had
been
complicated
by
a
residence
in
foreign
lands
and
who
yet
disliked
to
hear
americans
abused
we
don
t
like
to
tread
upon
people
s
toes
he
said
but
i
should
like
very
much
to
hear
about
your
marriage
now
tell
me
how
it
came
the
prince
fell
in
love
with
me
replied
the
baroness
simply
he
pressed
his
suit
very
hard
at
first
he
didn
t
wish
me
to
marry
him
on
the
contrary
but
on
that
basis
i
refused
to
listen
to
him
so
he
offered
me
marriage
in
so
far
as
he
might
i
was
young
and
i
confess
i
was
rather
flattered
but
if
it
were
to
be
done
again
now
i
certainly
should
not
accept
how
long
ago
was
this
asked
acton
oh
several
years
said
eugenia
you
should
never
ask
a
woman
for
why
i
should
think
that
when
a
woman
was
relating
history
acton
answered
and
now
he
wants
to
break
it
off
they
want
him
to
make
a
political
marriage
it
is
his
brother
s
idea
his
brother
is
very
they
must
be
a
precious
pair
cried
robert
acton
the
baroness
gave
a
little
philosophic
shrug
they
are
princes
they
think
they
are
treating
me
very
well
silberstadt
is
a
perfectly
despotic
little
state
and
the
reigning
prince
may
annul
the
marriage
by
a
stroke
of
his
pen
but
he
has
promised
me
nevertheless
not
to
do
so
without
my
formal
and
this
you
have
refused
hitherto
it
is
an
indignity
and
i
have
wished
at
least
to
make
it
difficult
for
them
but
i
have
a
little
document
in
my
which
i
have
only
to
sign
and
send
back
to
the
then
it
will
be
all
over
the
baroness
lifted
her
hand
and
dropped
it
again
of
course
i
shall
keep
my
title
at
least
i
shall
be
at
liberty
to
keep
it
if
i
choose
and
i
suppose
i
shall
keep
it
one
must
have
a
name
and
i
shall
keep
my
pension
it
is
very
small
it
is
wretchedly
small
but
it
is
what
i
live
and
you
have
only
to
sign
that
paper
acton
asked
the
baroness
looked
at
him
a
moment
do
you
urge
it
he
got
up
slowly
and
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
what
do
you
gain
by
not
doing
it
i
am
supposed
to
gain
this
advantage
that
if
i
delay
or
temporize
the
prince
may
come
back
to
me
may
make
a
stand
against
his
brother
he
is
very
fond
of
me
and
his
brother
has
pushed
him
only
little
by
if
he
were
to
come
back
to
you
said
acton
would
you
would
you
take
him
back
the
baroness
met
his
eyes
she
colored
just
a
little
then
she
rose
i
should
have
the
satisfaction
of
saying
now
it
is
my
turn
i
break
with
your
serene
highness
they
began
to
walk
toward
the
carriage
well
said
robert
acton
it
s
a
curious
story
how
did
you
make
his
acquaintance
i
was
staying
with
an
old
lady
an
old
countess
in
dresden
she
had
been
a
friend
of
my
father
s
my
father
was
dead
i
was
very
much
alone
my
brother
was
wandering
about
the
world
in
a
theatrical
your
brother
ought
to
have
stayed
with
you
acton
observed
and
kept
you
from
putting
your
trust
in
the
baroness
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
he
did
what
he
could
she
said
he
sent
me
money
the
old
countess
encouraged
the
prince
she
was
even
pressing
it
seems
to
me
madame
münster
added
gently
that
under
the
circumstances
i
behaved
very
acton
glanced
at
her
and
made
the
observation
he
had
made
it
before
that
a
woman
looks
the
prettier
for
having
unfolded
her
wrongs
or
her
sufferings
well
he
reflected
audibly
i
should
like
to
see
you
send
his
serene
highness
somewhere
madame
münster
stooped
and
plucked
a
daisy
from
the
grass
and
not
sign
my
renunciation
well
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
said
acton
in
one
case
i
should
have
my
revenge
in
another
case
i
should
have
my
acton
gave
a
little
laugh
as
he
helped
her
into
the
carriage
at
any
rate
he
said
take
good
care
of
that
a
couple
of
days
afterward
he
asked
her
to
come
and
see
his
house
the
visit
had
already
been
proposed
but
it
had
been
put
off
in
consequence
of
his
mother
s
illness
she
was
a
constant
invalid
and
she
had
passed
these
recent
years
very
patiently
in
a
great
flowered
at
her
bedroom
window
lately
for
some
days
she
had
been
unable
to
see
anyone
but
now
she
was
better
and
she
sent
the
baroness
a
very
civil
message
acton
had
wished
their
visitor
to
come
to
dinner
but
madame
münster
preferred
to
begin
with
a
simple
call
she
had
reflected
that
if
she
should
go
to
dinner
wentworth
and
his
daughters
would
also
be
asked
and
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
the
peculiar
character
of
the
occasion
would
be
best
preserved
in
a
with
her
host
why
the
occasion
should
have
a
peculiar
character
she
explained
to
no
one
as
far
as
anyone
could
see
it
was
simply
very
pleasant
acton
came
for
her
and
drove
her
to
his
door
an
operation
which
was
rapidly
performed
his
house
the
baroness
mentally
pronounced
a
very
good
one
more
articulately
she
declared
that
it
was
enchanting
it
was
large
and
square
and
painted
brown
it
stood
in
a
shrubbery
and
was
approached
from
the
gate
by
a
short
drive
it
was
moreover
a
much
more
modern
dwelling
than
wentworth
s
and
was
more
redundantly
upholstered
and
expensively
ornamented
the
baroness
perceived
that
her
entertainer
had
analyzed
material
comfort
to
a
sufficiently
fine
point
and
then
he
possessed
the
most
delightful
trophies
of
his
sojourn
in
the
celestial
empire
pagodas
of
ebony
and
cabinets
of
ivory
sculptured
monsters
grinning
and
leering
on
in
front
of
beautifully
figured
porcelain
gleaming
behind
the
glass
doors
of
mahogany
buffets
large
screens
in
corners
covered
with
tense
silk
and
embroidered
with
mandarins
and
dragons
these
things
were
scattered
all
over
the
house
and
they
gave
eugenia
a
pretext
for
a
complete
domiciliary
visit
she
liked
it
she
enjoyed
it
she
thought
it
a
very
nice
place
it
had
a
mixture
of
the
homely
and
the
liberal
and
though
it
was
almost
a
museum
the
large
rooms
were
as
fresh
and
clean
as
a
dairy
lizzie
acton
told
her
that
she
dusted
all
the
pagodas
and
other
curiosities
every
day
with
her
own
hands
and
the
baroness
answered
that
she
was
evidently
a
household
fairy
lizzie
had
not
at
all
the
look
of
a
young
lady
who
dusted
things
she
wore
such
pretty
dresses
and
had
such
delicate
fingers
that
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
her
immersed
in
sordid
cares
she
came
to
meet
madame
münster
on
her
arrival
but
she
said
nothing
or
almost
nothing
and
the
baroness
again
reflected
she
had
had
occasion
to
do
so
before
that
american
girls
had
no
manners
she
disliked
this
little
american
girl
and
she
was
quite
prepared
to
learn
that
she
had
failed
to
commend
herself
to
miss
acton
lizzie
struck
her
as
positive
and
explicit
almost
to
pertness
and
the
idea
of
her
combining
the
apparent
incongruities
of
a
taste
for
housework
and
the
wearing
of
fresh
dresses
suggested
the
possession
of
a
dangerous
energy
it
was
a
source
of
irritation
to
the
baroness
that
in
this
country
it
should
seem
to
matter
whether
a
little
girl
were
a
trifle
less
or
a
trifle
more
of
a
nonentity
for
eugenia
had
hitherto
been
conscious
of
no
moral
pressure
as
regards
the
appreciation
of
diminutive
virgins
it
was
perhaps
an
indication
of
lizzie
s
pertness
that
she
very
soon
retired
and
left
the
baroness
on
her
brother
s
hands
acton
talked
a
great
deal
about
his
he
knew
a
good
deal
about
porcelain
and
the
baroness
in
her
progress
through
the
house
made
as
it
were
a
great
many
stations
she
sat
down
everywhere
confessed
to
being
a
little
tired
and
asked
about
the
various
objects
with
a
curious
mixture
of
alertness
and
inattention
if
there
had
been
anyone
to
say
it
to
she
would
have
declared
that
she
was
positively
in
love
with
her
host
but
she
could
hardly
make
this
declaration
even
in
the
strictest
confidence
to
acton
himself
it
gave
her
nevertheless
a
pleasure
that
had
some
of
the
charm
of
unwontedness
to
feel
with
that
admirable
keenness
with
which
she
was
capable
of
feeling
things
that
he
had
a
disposition
without
any
edges
that
even
his
humorous
irony
always
expanded
toward
the
point
one
s
impression
of
his
honesty
was
almost
like
carrying
a
bunch
of
flowers
the
perfume
was
most
agreeable
but
they
were
occasionally
an
inconvenience
one
could
trust
him
at
any
rate
round
all
the
corners
of
the
world
and
withal
he
was
not
absolutely
simple
which
would
have
been
excess
he
was
only
relatively
simple
which
was
quite
enough
for
the
baroness
lizzie
reappeared
to
say
that
her
mother
would
now
be
happy
to
receive
madame
münster
and
the
baroness
followed
her
to
acton
s
apartment
eugenia
reflected
as
she
went
that
it
was
not
the
affectation
of
impertinence
that
made
her
dislike
this
young
lady
for
on
that
ground
she
could
easily
have
beaten
her
it
was
not
an
aspiration
on
the
girl
s
part
to
rivalry
but
a
kind
of
laughing
indifference
to
the
results
of
comparison
acton
was
an
emaciated
woman
of
five
and
fifty
sitting
with
pillows
behind
her
and
looking
out
on
a
clump
of
hemlocks
she
was
very
modest
very
timid
and
very
ill
she
made
eugenia
feel
grateful
that
she
herself
was
not
like
that
neither
so
ill
nor
possibly
so
modest
on
a
chair
beside
her
lay
a
volume
of
emerson
s
essays
it
was
a
great
occasion
for
poor
acton
in
her
helpless
condition
to
be
confronted
with
a
clever
foreign
lady
who
had
more
manner
than
any
lady
any
dozen
ladies
that
she
had
ever
seen
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
she
said
softly
to
the
baroness
from
your
son
eh
eugenia
asked
he
has
talked
to
me
immensely
of
you
oh
he
talks
of
you
as
you
would
like
the
baroness
declared
as
such
a
son
talk
of
such
a
mother
acton
sat
gazing
this
was
part
of
madame
münster
s
but
robert
acton
was
gazing
too
in
vivid
consciousness
that
he
had
barely
mentioned
his
mother
to
their
brilliant
guest
he
never
talked
of
this
still
maternal
presence
a
presence
refined
to
such
delicacy
that
it
had
almost
resolved
itself
with
him
simply
into
the
subjective
emotion
of
gratitude
and
acton
rarely
talked
of
his
emotions
the
baroness
turned
her
smile
toward
him
and
she
instantly
felt
that
she
had
been
observed
to
be
fibbing
she
had
struck
a
false
note
but
who
were
these
people
to
whom
such
fibbing
was
not
pleasing
if
they
were
annoyed
the
baroness
was
equally
so
and
after
the
exchange
of
a
few
civil
inquiries
and
responses
she
took
leave
of
acton
she
begged
robert
not
to
come
home
with
her
she
would
get
into
the
carriage
alone
she
preferred
that
this
was
imperious
and
she
thought
he
looked
disappointed
while
she
stood
before
the
door
with
him
the
carriage
was
turning
in
the
this
thought
restored
her
serenity
when
she
had
given
him
her
hand
in
farewell
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
i
have
almost
decided
to
dispatch
that
paper
she
said
he
knew
that
she
alluded
to
the
document
that
she
had
called
her
renunciation
and
he
assisted
her
into
the
carriage
without
saying
anything
but
just
before
the
vehicle
began
to
move
he
said
well
when
you
have
in
fact
dispatched
it
i
hope
you
will
let
me
know
chapter
vii
felix
young
finished
gertrude
s
portrait
and
he
afterwards
transferred
to
canvas
the
features
of
many
members
of
that
circle
of
which
it
may
be
said
that
he
had
become
for
the
time
the
pivot
and
the
centre
i
am
afraid
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
was
a
decidedly
flattering
painter
and
that
he
imparted
to
his
models
a
romantic
grace
which
seemed
easily
and
cheaply
acquired
by
the
payment
of
a
hundred
dollars
to
a
young
man
who
made
sitting
so
entertaining
for
felix
was
paid
for
his
pictures
making
as
he
did
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
in
guiding
his
steps
to
the
western
world
affectionate
curiosity
had
gone
hand
in
hand
with
a
desire
to
better
his
condition
he
took
his
uncle
s
portrait
quite
as
if
wentworth
had
never
averted
himself
from
the
experiment
and
as
he
compassed
his
end
only
by
the
exercise
of
gentle
violence
it
is
but
fair
to
add
that
he
allowed
the
old
man
to
give
him
nothing
but
his
time
he
passed
his
arm
into
wentworth
s
one
summer
morning
very
few
arms
indeed
had
ever
passed
into
wentworth
s
and
led
him
across
the
garden
and
along
the
road
into
the
studio
which
he
had
extemporized
in
the
little
house
among
the
apple
trees
the
grave
gentleman
felt
himself
more
and
more
fascinated
by
his
clever
nephew
whose
fresh
demonstrative
youth
seemed
a
compendium
of
experiences
so
strangely
numerous
it
appeared
to
him
that
felix
must
know
a
great
deal
he
would
like
to
learn
what
he
thought
about
some
of
those
things
as
regards
which
his
own
conversation
had
always
been
formal
but
his
knowledge
vague
felix
had
a
confident
gayly
trenchant
way
of
judging
human
actions
which
wentworth
grew
little
by
little
to
envy
it
seemed
like
criticism
made
easy
forming
an
opinion
say
on
a
person
s
conduct
was
with
wentworth
a
good
deal
like
fumbling
in
a
lock
with
a
key
chosen
at
hazard
he
seemed
to
himself
to
go
about
the
world
with
a
big
bunch
of
these
ineffectual
instruments
at
his
girdle
his
nephew
on
the
other
hand
with
a
single
turn
of
the
wrist
opened
any
door
as
adroitly
as
a
he
felt
obliged
to
keep
up
the
convention
that
an
uncle
is
always
wiser
than
a
nephew
even
if
he
could
keep
it
up
no
otherwise
than
by
listening
in
serious
silence
to
felix
s
quick
light
constant
discourse
but
there
came
a
day
when
he
lapsed
from
consistency
and
almost
asked
his
nephew
s
advice
have
you
ever
entertained
the
idea
of
settling
in
the
united
states
he
asked
one
morning
while
felix
brilliantly
plied
his
brush
my
dear
uncle
said
felix
excuse
me
if
your
question
makes
me
smile
a
little
to
begin
with
i
have
never
entertained
an
idea
ideas
often
entertain
but
i
am
afraid
i
have
never
seriously
made
a
plan
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
or
rather
i
know
what
you
think
for
i
don
t
think
you
will
say
it
that
this
is
very
frivolous
and
on
my
part
so
it
is
but
i
am
made
like
that
i
take
things
as
they
come
and
somehow
there
is
always
some
new
thing
to
follow
the
last
in
the
second
place
i
should
never
propose
to
i
can
t
settle
my
dear
uncle
i
m
not
a
settler
i
know
that
is
what
strangers
are
supposed
to
do
here
they
always
settle
but
i
haven
t
to
answer
your
question
entertained
that
you
intend
to
return
to
europe
and
resume
your
irregular
manner
of
life
wentworth
inquired
i
can
t
say
i
intend
but
it
s
very
likely
i
shall
go
back
to
europe
after
all
i
am
a
european
i
feel
that
you
know
it
will
depend
a
good
deal
upon
my
sister
she
s
even
more
of
a
european
than
i
here
you
know
she
s
a
picture
out
of
her
setting
and
as
for
resuming
dear
uncle
i
really
have
never
given
up
my
irregular
manner
of
life
what
for
me
could
be
more
irregular
than
this
than
what
asked
wentworth
with
his
pale
gravity
well
than
everything
living
in
the
midst
of
you
this
way
this
charming
quiet
serious
family
life
fraternizing
with
charlotte
and
gertrude
calling
upon
twenty
young
ladies
and
going
out
to
walk
with
them
sitting
with
you
in
the
evening
on
the
piazza
and
listening
to
the
crickets
and
going
to
bed
at
ten
o
your
description
is
very
animated
said
wentworth
but
i
see
nothing
improper
in
what
you
neither
do
i
dear
uncle
it
is
extremely
delightful
i
shouldn
t
like
it
if
it
were
improper
i
assure
you
i
don
t
like
improper
things
though
i
dare
say
you
think
i
do
felix
went
on
painting
away
i
have
never
accused
you
of
pray
don
t
said
felix
because
you
see
at
bottom
i
am
a
terrible
a
philistine
repeated
wentworth
i
mean
as
one
may
say
a
plain
wentworth
looked
at
him
reservedly
like
a
mystified
sage
and
felix
continued
i
trust
i
shall
enjoy
a
venerable
and
venerated
old
age
i
mean
to
live
long
i
can
hardly
call
that
a
plan
perhaps
but
it
s
a
keen
desire
a
rosy
vision
i
shall
be
a
lively
perhaps
even
a
frivolous
old
man
it
is
natural
said
his
uncle
sententiously
that
one
should
desire
to
prolong
an
agreeable
life
we
have
perhaps
a
selfish
indisposition
to
bring
our
pleasure
to
a
close
but
i
presume
he
added
that
you
expect
to
that
too
dear
uncle
is
a
hope
a
desire
a
vision
said
felix
it
occurred
to
him
for
an
instant
that
this
was
possibly
a
preface
to
the
offer
of
the
hand
of
one
of
wentworth
s
admirable
daughters
but
in
the
name
of
decent
modesty
and
a
proper
sense
of
the
hard
realities
of
this
world
felix
banished
the
thought
his
uncle
was
the
incarnation
of
benevolence
certainly
but
from
that
to
accepting
much
more
postulating
the
idea
of
a
union
between
a
young
lady
with
a
dowry
presumptively
brilliant
and
a
penniless
artist
with
no
prospect
of
fame
there
was
a
very
long
way
felix
had
lately
become
conscious
of
a
luxurious
preference
for
the
society
if
possible
unshared
with
others
of
gertrude
wentworth
but
he
had
relegated
this
young
lady
for
the
moment
to
the
coldly
brilliant
category
of
unattainable
possessions
she
was
not
the
first
woman
for
whom
he
had
entertained
an
unpractical
admiration
he
had
been
in
love
with
duchesses
and
countesses
and
he
had
made
once
or
twice
a
perilously
near
approach
to
cynicism
in
declaring
that
the
disinterestedness
of
women
had
been
overrated
on
the
whole
he
had
tempered
audacity
with
modesty
and
it
is
but
fair
to
him
now
to
say
explicitly
that
he
would
have
been
incapable
of
taking
advantage
of
his
present
large
allowance
of
familiarity
to
make
love
to
the
younger
of
his
handsome
cousins
felix
had
grown
up
among
traditions
in
the
light
of
which
such
a
proceeding
looked
like
a
grievous
breach
of
hospitality
i
have
said
that
he
was
always
happy
and
it
may
be
counted
among
the
present
sources
of
his
happiness
that
he
had
as
regards
this
matter
of
his
relations
with
gertrude
a
deliciously
good
conscience
his
own
deportment
seemed
to
him
suffused
with
the
beauty
of
virtue
a
form
of
beauty
that
he
admired
with
the
same
vivacity
with
which
he
admired
all
other
forms
i
think
that
if
you
marry
said
wentworth
presently
it
will
conduce
to
your
sicurissimo
felix
exclaimed
and
then
arresting
his
brush
he
looked
at
his
uncle
with
a
smile
there
is
something
i
feel
tempted
to
say
to
you
may
i
risk
it
wentworth
drew
himself
up
a
little
i
am
very
safe
i
don
t
repeat
but
he
hoped
felix
would
not
risk
too
much
felix
was
laughing
at
his
answer
it
s
odd
to
hear
you
telling
me
how
to
be
happy
i
don
t
think
you
know
yourself
dear
uncle
now
does
that
sound
brutal
the
old
man
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
with
a
dry
dignity
that
suddenly
touched
his
nephew
we
may
sometimes
point
out
a
road
we
are
unable
to
ah
don
t
tell
me
you
have
had
any
sorrows
felix
rejoined
i
didn
t
suppose
it
and
i
didn
t
mean
to
allude
to
them
i
simply
meant
that
you
all
don
t
amuse
amuse
ourselves
we
are
not
precisely
not
you
have
reached
the
proper
age
i
was
saying
that
the
other
day
to
gertrude
felix
added
i
hope
it
was
not
if
it
was
said
wentworth
with
a
keener
irony
than
felix
would
have
thought
him
capable
of
it
was
but
your
way
of
amusing
yourself
i
am
afraid
you
have
never
had
a
oh
yes
i
have
felix
declared
with
some
spirit
before
i
knew
better
but
you
don
t
catch
me
at
it
wentworth
maintained
for
a
while
a
silence
more
expressive
than
a
sigh
you
have
no
children
he
said
at
last
don
t
tell
me
felix
exclaimed
that
your
charming
young
people
are
a
source
of
grief
to
you
i
don
t
speak
of
and
then
after
a
pause
wentworth
continued
i
don
t
speak
of
gertrude
but
i
feel
considerable
anxiety
about
clifford
i
will
tell
you
another
the
next
time
he
gave
felix
a
sitting
his
nephew
reminded
him
that
he
had
taken
him
into
his
confidence
how
is
clifford
today
felix
asked
he
has
always
seemed
to
me
a
young
man
of
remarkable
discretion
indeed
he
is
only
too
discreet
he
seems
on
his
guard
against
me
as
if
he
thought
me
rather
light
company
the
other
day
he
told
his
sister
gertrude
repeated
it
to
me
that
i
was
always
laughing
at
him
if
i
laugh
it
is
simply
from
the
impulse
to
try
and
inspire
him
with
confidence
that
is
the
only
way
i
clifford
s
situation
is
no
laughing
matter
said
wentworth
it
is
very
peculiar
as
i
suppose
you
have
ah
you
mean
his
love
affair
with
his
cousin
wentworth
stared
blushing
a
little
i
mean
his
absence
from
college
he
has
been
suspended
we
have
decided
not
to
speak
of
it
unless
we
are
suspended
felix
repeated
he
has
been
requested
by
the
harvard
authorities
to
absent
himself
for
six
months
meanwhile
he
is
studying
with
mr
brand
we
think
mr
brand
will
help
him
at
least
we
hope
what
befell
him
at
college
felix
asked
he
was
too
fond
of
pleasure
mr
brand
certainly
will
not
teach
him
any
of
those
secrets
he
was
too
fond
of
something
of
which
he
should
not
have
been
fond
i
suppose
it
is
considered
a
felix
gave
his
light
laugh
my
dear
uncle
is
there
any
doubt
about
its
being
a
pleasure
est
de
son
as
they
say
in
i
should
have
said
rather
it
was
a
vice
of
later
life
of
disappointed
old
felix
glanced
at
his
uncle
with
his
lifted
eyebrows
and
then
of
what
are
you
speaking
he
demanded
smiling
of
the
situation
in
which
clifford
was
ah
he
was
found
he
was
caught
necessarily
he
was
caught
he
couldn
t
walk
he
oh
said
felix
he
drinks
i
rather
suspected
that
from
something
i
observed
the
first
day
i
came
here
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
it
is
a
low
taste
it
s
not
a
vice
for
a
gentleman
he
ought
to
give
it
we
hope
for
a
good
deal
from
brand
s
influence
wentworth
went
on
he
has
talked
to
him
from
the
first
and
he
never
touches
anything
i
will
talk
to
him
i
will
talk
to
him
felix
declared
gayly
what
will
you
say
to
him
asked
his
uncle
with
some
apprehension
felix
for
some
moments
answered
nothing
do
you
mean
to
marry
him
to
his
cousin
he
asked
at
last
marry
him
echoed
wentworth
i
shouldn
t
think
his
cousin
would
want
to
marry
you
have
no
understanding
then
with
acton
wentworth
stared
almost
blankly
i
have
never
discussed
such
subjects
with
i
should
think
it
might
be
time
said
felix
lizzie
acton
is
admirably
pretty
and
if
clifford
is
dangerous
they
are
not
engaged
said
wentworth
i
have
no
reason
to
suppose
they
are
par
exemple
cried
felix
a
clandestine
engagement
trust
me
clifford
as
i
say
is
a
charming
boy
he
is
incapable
of
that
lizzie
acton
then
would
not
be
jealous
of
another
i
certainly
hope
not
said
the
old
man
with
a
vague
sense
of
jealousy
being
an
even
lower
vice
than
a
love
of
liquor
the
best
thing
for
clifford
then
felix
propounded
is
to
become
interested
in
some
clever
charming
and
he
paused
in
his
painting
and
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
looked
with
bright
communicativeness
at
his
uncle
you
see
i
believe
greatly
in
the
influence
of
women
living
with
women
helps
to
make
a
man
a
gentleman
it
is
very
true
clifford
has
his
sisters
who
are
so
charming
but
there
should
be
a
different
sentiment
in
play
from
the
fraternal
you
know
he
has
lizzie
acton
but
she
perhaps
is
rather
i
suspect
lizzie
has
talked
to
him
reasoned
with
him
said
wentworth
on
the
impropriety
of
getting
tipsy
on
the
beauty
of
temperance
that
is
dreary
work
for
a
pretty
young
girl
no
felix
continued
clifford
ought
to
frequent
some
agreeable
woman
who
without
ever
mentioning
such
unsavory
subjects
would
give
him
a
sense
of
its
being
very
ridiculous
to
be
fuddled
if
he
could
fall
in
love
with
her
a
little
so
much
the
better
the
thing
would
operate
as
a
well
now
what
lady
should
you
suggest
asked
wentworth
there
is
a
clever
woman
under
your
hand
my
your
sister
under
my
hand
wentworth
repeated
say
a
word
to
clifford
tell
him
to
be
bold
he
is
well
disposed
already
he
has
invited
her
two
or
three
times
to
drive
but
i
don
t
think
he
comes
to
see
her
give
him
a
hint
to
come
to
come
often
he
will
sit
there
of
an
afternoon
and
they
will
talk
it
will
do
him
wentworth
meditated
you
think
she
will
exercise
a
helpful
influence
she
will
exercise
a
civilizing
i
may
call
it
a
sobering
influence
a
charming
clever
witty
woman
always
does
especially
if
she
is
a
little
of
a
coquette
my
dear
uncle
the
society
of
such
women
has
been
half
my
education
if
clifford
is
suspended
as
you
say
from
college
let
eugenia
be
his
wentworth
continued
thoughtful
you
think
eugenia
is
a
coquette
he
asked
what
pretty
woman
is
not
felix
demanded
in
turn
but
this
for
wentworth
could
at
the
best
have
been
no
answer
for
he
did
not
think
his
niece
pretty
with
clifford
the
young
man
pursued
eugenia
will
simply
be
enough
of
a
coquette
to
be
a
little
ironical
that
s
what
he
needs
so
you
recommend
him
to
be
nice
with
her
you
know
the
suggestion
will
come
best
from
do
i
understand
asked
the
old
man
that
i
am
to
suggest
to
my
son
to
make
a
a
profession
of
of
affection
to
madame
münster
yes
yes
a
profession
cried
felix
sympathetically
but
as
i
understand
it
madame
münster
is
a
married
ah
said
felix
smiling
of
course
she
can
t
marry
him
but
she
will
do
what
she
wentworth
sat
for
some
time
with
his
eyes
on
the
floor
at
last
he
got
up
i
don
t
think
he
said
that
i
can
undertake
to
recommend
my
son
any
such
and
without
meeting
felix
s
surprised
glance
he
broke
off
his
sitting
which
was
not
resumed
for
a
fortnight
felix
was
very
fond
of
the
little
lake
which
occupied
so
many
of
wentworth
s
numerous
acres
and
of
a
remarkable
pine
grove
which
lay
upon
the
further
side
of
it
planted
upon
a
steep
embankment
and
haunted
by
the
summer
breeze
the
murmur
of
the
air
in
the
far
off
had
a
strange
distinctness
it
was
almost
articulate
one
afternoon
the
young
man
came
out
of
his
and
passed
the
open
door
of
eugenia
s
little
salon
within
in
the
cool
dimness
he
saw
his
sister
dressed
in
white
buried
in
her
and
holding
to
her
face
an
immense
bouquet
opposite
to
her
sat
clifford
wentworth
twirling
his
hat
he
had
evidently
just
presented
the
bouquet
to
the
baroness
whose
fine
eyes
as
she
glanced
at
him
over
the
big
roses
and
geraniums
wore
a
conversational
smile
felix
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
cottage
hesitated
for
a
moment
as
to
whether
he
should
retrace
his
steps
and
enter
the
parlor
then
he
went
his
way
and
passed
into
wentworth
s
garden
that
civilizing
process
to
which
he
had
suggested
that
clifford
should
be
subjected
appeared
to
have
come
on
of
itself
felix
was
very
sure
at
least
that
wentworth
had
not
adopted
his
ingenious
device
for
stimulating
the
young
man
s
aesthetic
consciousness
doubtless
he
supposes
he
said
to
himself
after
the
conversation
that
has
been
narrated
that
i
desire
out
of
fraternal
benevolence
to
procure
for
eugenia
the
amusement
of
a
flirtation
or
as
he
probably
calls
it
an
intrigue
with
the
too
susceptible
clifford
it
must
be
admitted
and
i
have
noticed
it
before
that
nothing
exceeds
the
license
occasionally
taken
by
the
imagination
of
very
rigid
felix
on
his
own
side
had
of
course
said
nothing
to
clifford
but
he
had
observed
to
eugenia
that
wentworth
was
much
mortified
at
his
son
s
low
tastes
we
ought
to
do
something
to
help
them
after
all
their
kindness
to
us
he
had
added
encourage
clifford
to
come
and
see
you
and
inspire
him
with
a
taste
for
conversation
that
will
supplant
the
other
which
only
comes
from
his
puerility
from
his
not
taking
his
position
in
the
world
that
of
a
rich
young
man
of
ancient
stock
seriously
enough
make
him
a
little
more
serious
even
if
he
makes
love
to
you
it
is
no
great
i
am
to
offer
myself
as
a
superior
form
of
intoxication
a
substitute
for
a
brandy
bottle
eh
asked
the
baroness
truly
in
this
country
one
comes
to
strange
but
she
had
not
positively
declined
to
undertake
clifford
s
higher
education
and
felix
who
had
not
thought
of
the
matter
again
being
haunted
with
visions
of
more
personal
profit
now
reflected
that
the
work
of
redemption
had
fairly
begun
the
idea
in
prospect
had
seemed
of
the
happiest
but
in
operation
it
made
him
a
trifle
uneasy
what
if
eugenia
what
if
eugenia
he
asked
himself
softly
the
question
dying
away
in
his
sense
of
eugenia
s
undetermined
capacity
but
before
felix
had
time
either
to
accept
or
to
reject
its
admonition
even
in
this
vague
form
he
saw
robert
acton
turn
out
of
wentworth
s
enclosure
by
a
distant
gate
and
come
toward
the
cottage
in
the
orchard
acton
had
evidently
walked
from
his
own
house
along
a
shady
and
was
intending
to
pay
a
visit
to
madame
münster
felix
watched
him
a
moment
then
he
turned
away
acton
could
be
left
to
play
the
part
of
providence
and
interrupt
if
interruption
were
needed
clifford
s
entanglement
with
eugenia
felix
passed
through
the
garden
toward
the
house
and
toward
a
postern
gate
which
opened
upon
a
path
leading
across
the
fields
beside
a
little
wood
to
the
lake
he
stopped
and
looked
up
at
the
house
his
eyes
rested
more
particularly
upon
a
certain
open
window
on
the
shady
side
presently
gertrude
appeared
there
looking
out
into
the
summer
light
he
took
off
his
hat
to
her
and
bade
her
he
remarked
that
he
was
going
to
row
across
the
pond
and
begged
that
she
would
do
him
the
honor
to
accompany
him
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
then
without
saying
anything
she
turned
away
but
she
soon
reappeared
below
in
one
of
those
quaint
and
charming
leghorn
hats
tied
with
white
satin
bows
that
were
worn
at
that
period
she
also
carried
a
green
parasol
she
went
with
him
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
where
a
couple
of
boats
were
always
moored
they
got
into
one
of
them
and
felix
with
gentle
strokes
propelled
it
to
the
opposite
shore
the
day
was
the
perfection
of
summer
weather
the
little
lake
was
the
color
of
sunshine
the
plash
of
the
oars
was
the
only
sound
and
they
found
themselves
listening
to
it
they
disembarked
and
by
a
winding
path
ascended
the
mound
which
overlooked
the
water
whose
white
expanse
glittered
between
the
trees
the
place
was
delightfully
cool
and
had
the
added
charm
that
in
the
softly
sounding
pine
boughs
you
seemed
to
hear
the
coolness
as
well
as
feel
it
felix
and
gertrude
sat
down
on
the
carpet
of
and
talked
of
many
things
felix
spoke
at
last
in
the
course
of
talk
of
his
going
away
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
alluded
to
it
you
are
going
away
said
gertrude
looking
at
him
some
day
when
the
leaves
begin
to
fall
you
know
i
can
t
stay
gertrude
transferred
her
eyes
to
the
outer
prospect
and
then
after
a
pause
she
said
i
shall
never
see
you
why
not
asked
felix
we
shall
probably
both
survive
my
but
gertrude
only
repeated
i
shall
never
see
you
again
i
shall
never
hear
of
you
she
went
on
i
shall
know
nothing
about
you
i
knew
nothing
about
you
before
and
it
will
be
the
same
i
knew
nothing
about
you
then
unfortunately
said
felix
but
now
i
shall
write
to
don
t
write
to
me
i
shall
not
answer
you
gertrude
declared
i
should
of
course
burn
your
letters
said
felix
gertrude
looked
at
him
again
burn
my
letters
you
sometimes
say
strange
they
are
not
strange
in
themselves
the
young
man
answered
they
are
only
strange
as
said
to
you
you
will
come
to
with
whom
shall
i
come
she
asked
this
question
simply
she
was
very
much
in
earnest
felix
was
interested
in
her
earnestness
for
some
moments
he
hesitated
you
can
t
tell
me
that
she
pursued
you
can
t
say
that
i
shall
go
with
my
father
and
my
sister
you
don
t
believe
i
shall
keep
your
letters
said
felix
presently
for
all
answer
i
never
write
i
don
t
know
how
to
gertrude
for
some
time
said
nothing
more
and
her
companion
as
he
looked
at
her
wished
it
had
not
been
disloyal
to
make
love
to
the
daughter
of
an
old
gentleman
who
had
offered
one
hospitality
the
afternoon
waned
the
shadows
stretched
themselves
and
the
light
grew
deeper
in
the
western
sky
two
persons
appeared
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
coming
from
the
house
and
crossing
the
meadow
it
is
charlotte
and
brand
said
gertrude
they
are
coming
over
but
charlotte
and
mr
brand
only
came
down
to
the
edge
of
the
water
and
stood
there
looking
across
they
made
no
motion
to
enter
the
boat
that
felix
had
left
at
the
felix
waved
his
hat
to
them
it
was
too
far
to
call
they
made
no
visible
response
and
they
presently
turned
away
and
walked
along
the
shore
mr
brand
is
not
demonstrative
said
felix
he
is
never
demonstrative
to
me
he
sits
silent
with
his
chin
in
his
hand
looking
at
me
sometimes
he
looks
away
your
father
tells
me
he
is
so
eloquent
and
i
should
like
to
hear
him
talk
he
looks
like
such
a
noble
young
man
but
with
me
he
will
never
talk
and
yet
i
am
so
fond
of
listening
to
brilliant
imagery
he
is
very
eloquent
said
gertrude
but
he
has
no
brilliant
imagery
i
have
heard
him
talk
a
great
deal
i
knew
that
when
they
saw
us
they
would
not
come
over
ah
he
is
making
as
they
say
to
your
sister
they
desire
to
be
alone
no
said
gertrude
gravely
they
have
no
such
reason
as
that
for
being
but
why
doesn
t
he
make
to
charlotte
felix
inquired
she
is
so
pretty
so
gentle
so
gertrude
glanced
at
him
and
then
she
looked
at
the
couple
they
were
discussing
mr
brand
and
charlotte
were
walking
side
by
side
they
might
have
been
a
pair
of
lovers
and
yet
they
might
not
they
think
i
should
not
be
here
said
gertrude
with
me
i
thought
you
didn
t
have
those
you
don
t
understand
there
are
a
great
many
things
you
don
t
i
understand
my
stupidity
but
why
then
do
not
charlotte
and
mr
brand
who
as
an
elder
sister
and
a
clergyman
are
free
to
walk
about
together
come
over
and
make
me
wiser
by
breaking
up
the
unlawful
interview
into
which
i
have
lured
you
that
is
the
last
thing
they
would
do
said
gertrude
felix
stared
at
her
a
moment
with
his
lifted
eyebrows
je
n
y
comprends
rien
he
exclaimed
then
his
eyes
followed
for
a
while
the
retreating
figures
of
this
critical
pair
you
may
say
what
you
please
he
declared
it
is
evident
to
me
that
your
sister
is
not
indifferent
to
her
clever
companion
it
is
agreeable
to
her
to
be
walking
there
with
him
i
can
see
that
from
and
in
the
excitement
of
observation
felix
rose
to
his
feet
gertrude
rose
also
but
she
made
no
attempt
to
emulate
her
companion
s
discovery
she
looked
rather
in
another
direction
felix
s
words
had
struck
her
but
a
certain
delicacy
checked
her
she
is
certainly
not
indifferent
to
mr
brand
she
has
the
highest
opinion
of
one
can
see
it
one
can
see
it
said
felix
in
a
tone
of
amused
contemplation
with
his
head
on
one
side
gertrude
turned
her
back
to
the
opposite
shore
it
was
disagreeable
to
her
to
look
but
she
hoped
felix
would
say
something
more
ah
they
have
wandered
away
into
the
wood
he
added
gertrude
turned
round
again
she
is
in
love
with
him
she
said
it
seemed
her
duty
to
say
that
then
he
is
in
love
with
her
or
if
he
is
not
he
ought
to
be
she
is
such
a
perfect
little
woman
of
her
kind
she
reminds
me
of
a
pair
of
silver
you
know
i
am
very
fond
of
sugar
and
she
is
very
nice
with
mr
brand
i
have
noticed
that
very
gentle
and
gertrude
reflected
a
moment
then
she
took
a
great
resolution
she
wants
him
to
marry
me
she
said
so
of
course
she
is
felix
s
eyebrows
rose
higher
than
ever
to
marry
you
ah
ah
this
is
interesting
and
you
think
one
must
be
very
nice
with
a
man
to
induce
him
to
do
that
gertrude
had
turned
a
little
pale
but
she
went
on
mr
brand
wants
it
felix
folded
his
arms
and
stood
looking
at
her
i
see
i
see
he
said
quickly
why
did
you
never
tell
me
this
before
it
is
disagreeable
to
me
to
speak
of
it
even
now
i
wished
simply
to
explain
to
you
about
you
don
t
wish
to
marry
mr
brand
then
no
said
gertrude
gravely
and
does
your
father
wish
it
very
and
you
don
t
like
him
you
have
refused
him
i
don
t
wish
to
marry
your
father
and
sister
think
you
ought
to
eh
it
is
a
long
story
said
gertrude
they
think
there
are
good
reasons
i
can
t
explain
it
they
think
i
have
obligations
and
that
i
have
encouraged
felix
smiled
at
her
as
if
she
had
been
telling
him
an
amusing
story
about
someone
else
i
can
t
tell
you
how
this
interests
me
he
said
now
you
don
t
recognize
these
reasons
these
obligations
i
am
not
sure
it
is
not
and
she
picked
up
her
parasol
and
turned
away
as
if
to
descend
the
slope
tell
me
this
felix
went
on
going
with
her
are
you
likely
to
give
in
to
let
them
persuade
you
gertrude
looked
at
him
with
the
serious
face
that
she
had
constantly
worn
in
opposition
to
his
almost
eager
smile
i
shall
never
marry
brand
she
said
i
see
felix
rejoined
and
they
slowly
descended
the
hill
together
saying
nothing
till
they
reached
the
margin
of
the
pond
it
is
your
own
affair
he
then
resumed
but
do
you
know
i
am
not
altogether
glad
if
it
were
settled
that
you
were
to
marry
mr
brand
i
should
take
a
certain
comfort
in
the
arrangement
i
should
feel
more
free
i
have
no
right
to
make
love
to
you
myself
eh
and
he
paused
lightly
pressing
his
argument
upon
her
none
whatever
replied
gertrude
quickly
too
quickly
your
father
would
never
hear
of
it
i
haven
t
a
penny
mr
brand
of
course
has
property
of
his
own
eh
i
believe
he
has
some
property
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
with
you
of
course
not
but
with
your
father
and
sister
it
must
have
so
as
i
say
if
this
were
settled
i
should
feel
more
at
more
at
liberty
gertrude
repeated
please
unfasten
the
felix
untwisted
the
rope
and
stood
holding
it
i
should
be
able
to
say
things
to
you
that
i
can
t
give
myself
the
pleasure
of
saying
now
he
went
on
i
could
tell
you
how
much
i
admire
you
without
seeming
to
pretend
to
that
which
i
have
no
right
to
pretend
to
i
should
make
violent
love
to
you
he
added
laughing
if
i
thought
you
were
so
placed
as
not
to
be
offended
by
you
mean
if
i
were
engaged
to
another
man
that
is
strange
reasoning
gertrude
exclaimed
in
that
case
you
would
not
take
me
i
take
everyone
seriously
said
gertrude
and
without
his
help
she
stepped
lightly
into
the
boat
felix
took
up
the
oars
and
sent
it
forward
ah
this
is
what
you
have
been
thinking
about
it
seemed
to
me
you
had
something
on
your
mind
i
wish
very
much
he
added
that
you
would
tell
me
some
of
these
reasons
these
they
are
not
real
reasons
good
reasons
said
gertrude
looking
at
the
pink
and
yellow
gleams
in
the
water
i
can
understand
that
because
a
handsome
girl
has
had
a
spark
of
coquetry
that
is
no
if
you
mean
me
it
s
not
that
i
have
not
done
it
is
something
that
troubles
you
at
any
rate
said
felix
not
so
much
as
it
used
to
gertrude
rejoined
he
looked
at
her
smiling
always
that
is
not
saying
much
eh
but
she
only
rested
her
eyes
very
gravely
on
the
lighted
water
she
seemed
to
him
to
be
trying
to
hide
the
signs
of
the
trouble
of
which
she
had
just
told
him
felix
felt
at
all
times
much
the
same
impulse
to
dissipate
visible
melancholy
that
a
good
housewife
feels
to
brush
away
dust
there
was
something
he
wished
to
brush
away
now
suddenly
he
stopped
rowing
and
poised
his
oars
why
should
mr
brand
have
addressed
himself
to
you
and
not
to
your
sister
he
asked
i
am
sure
she
would
listen
to
gertrude
in
her
family
was
thought
capable
of
a
good
deal
of
levity
but
her
levity
had
never
gone
so
far
as
this
it
moved
her
greatly
however
to
hear
felix
say
that
he
was
sure
of
something
so
that
raising
her
eyes
toward
him
she
tried
intently
for
some
moments
to
conjure
up
this
wonderful
image
of
a
between
her
own
sister
and
her
own
suitor
we
know
that
gertrude
had
an
imaginative
mind
so
that
it
is
not
impossible
that
this
effort
should
have
been
partially
successful
but
she
only
murmured
ah
felix
ah
felix
why
shouldn
t
they
marry
try
and
make
them
marry
cried
felix
try
and
make
them
turn
the
tables
on
them
then
they
will
leave
you
alone
i
will
help
you
as
far
as
i
gertrude
s
heart
began
to
beat
she
was
greatly
excited
she
had
never
had
anything
so
interesting
proposed
to
her
before
felix
had
begun
to
row
again
and
he
now
sent
the
boat
home
with
long
strokes
i
believe
she
care
for
him
said
gertrude
after
they
had
disembarked
of
course
she
does
and
we
will
marry
them
off
it
will
make
them
happy
it
will
make
everyone
happy
we
shall
have
a
wedding
and
i
will
write
an
it
seems
as
if
it
would
make
happy
said
gertrude
to
get
rid
of
mr
brand
eh
to
recover
your
liberty
gertrude
walked
on
to
see
my
sister
married
to
so
good
a
felix
gave
his
light
laugh
you
always
put
things
on
those
grounds
you
will
never
say
anything
for
yourself
you
are
all
so
afraid
here
of
being
selfish
i
don
t
think
you
know
how
he
went
on
let
me
show
you
it
will
make
me
happy
for
myself
and
for
just
the
reverse
of
what
i
told
you
a
while
ago
after
that
when
i
make
love
to
you
you
will
have
to
think
i
mean
i
shall
never
think
you
mean
anything
said
gertrude
you
are
too
ah
cried
felix
that
s
a
license
to
say
everything
gertrude
i
adore
you
chapter
viii
charlotte
and
mr
brand
had
not
returned
when
they
reached
the
house
but
the
baroness
had
come
to
tea
and
robert
acton
also
who
now
regularly
asked
for
a
place
at
this
generous
repast
or
made
his
appearance
later
in
the
evening
clifford
wentworth
with
his
juvenile
growl
remarked
upon
it
you
are
always
coming
to
tea
nowadays
robert
he
said
i
should
think
you
had
drunk
enough
tea
in
since
when
is
acton
more
frequent
asked
the
baroness
since
you
came
said
clifford
it
seems
as
if
you
were
a
kind
of
i
suppose
i
am
a
curiosity
said
the
baroness
give
me
time
and
i
will
make
you
a
it
would
fall
to
pieces
after
you
go
exclaimed
acton
don
t
talk
about
her
going
in
that
familiar
way
clifford
said
it
makes
me
feel
wentworth
glanced
at
his
son
and
taking
note
of
these
words
wondered
if
felix
had
been
teaching
him
according
to
the
programme
he
had
sketched
out
to
make
love
to
the
wife
of
a
german
prince
charlotte
came
in
late
with
mr
brand
but
gertrude
to
whom
at
least
felix
had
taught
something
looked
in
vain
in
her
face
for
the
traces
of
a
guilty
passion
mr
brand
sat
down
by
gertrude
and
she
presently
asked
him
why
they
had
not
crossed
the
pond
to
join
felix
and
herself
it
is
cruel
of
you
to
ask
me
that
he
answered
very
softly
he
had
a
large
morsel
of
cake
before
him
but
he
fingered
it
without
eating
it
i
sometimes
think
you
are
growing
cruel
he
added
gertrude
said
nothing
she
was
afraid
to
speak
there
was
a
kind
of
rage
in
her
heart
she
felt
as
if
she
could
easily
persuade
herself
that
she
was
persecuted
she
said
to
herself
that
it
was
quite
right
that
she
should
not
allow
him
to
make
her
believe
she
was
wrong
she
thought
of
what
felix
had
said
to
her
she
wished
indeed
mr
brand
would
marry
charlotte
she
looked
away
from
him
and
spoke
no
more
mr
brand
ended
by
eating
his
cake
while
felix
sat
opposite
describing
to
wentworth
the
students
duels
at
heidelberg
after
tea
they
all
dispersed
themselves
as
usual
upon
the
piazza
and
in
the
garden
and
mr
brand
drew
near
to
gertrude
again
i
didn
t
come
to
you
this
afternoon
because
you
were
not
alone
he
began
because
you
were
with
a
newer
felix
he
is
an
old
friend
by
this
mr
brand
looked
at
the
ground
for
some
moments
i
thought
i
was
prepared
to
hear
you
speak
in
that
way
he
resumed
but
i
find
it
very
i
don
t
see
what
else
i
can
say
said
gertrude
mr
brand
walked
beside
her
for
a
while
in
silence
gertrude
wished
he
would
go
away
he
is
certainly
very
accomplished
but
i
think
i
ought
to
advise
to
advise
me
i
think
i
know
your
i
think
you
don
t
said
gertrude
with
a
soft
laugh
you
make
yourself
out
worse
than
you
are
to
please
him
mr
brand
said
gently
worse
to
please
him
what
do
you
mean
asked
gertrude
stopping
mr
brand
stopped
also
and
with
the
same
soft
he
doesn
t
care
for
the
things
you
care
for
the
great
questions
of
gertrude
with
her
eyes
on
his
shook
her
head
i
don
t
care
for
the
great
questions
of
life
they
are
much
beyond
there
was
a
time
when
you
didn
t
say
that
said
mr
brand
oh
rejoined
gertrude
i
think
you
made
me
talk
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
and
it
depends
she
added
upon
what
you
call
the
great
questions
of
life
there
are
some
things
i
care
are
they
the
things
you
talk
about
with
your
cousin
you
should
not
say
things
to
me
against
my
cousin
brand
said
gertrude
that
is
he
listened
to
this
respectfully
then
he
answered
with
a
little
vibration
of
the
voice
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
do
anything
dishonorable
but
i
don
t
see
why
it
is
dishonorable
to
say
that
your
cousin
is
go
and
say
it
to
himself
i
think
he
would
admit
it
said
mr
brand
that
is
the
tone
he
would
take
he
would
not
be
ashamed
of
then
i
am
not
ashamed
of
it
gertrude
declared
that
is
probably
what
i
like
him
for
i
am
frivolous
you
are
trying
as
i
said
just
now
to
lower
i
am
trying
for
once
to
be
natural
cried
gertrude
passionately
i
have
been
pretending
all
my
life
i
have
been
dishonest
it
is
you
that
have
made
me
so
mr
brand
stood
gazing
at
her
and
she
went
on
why
shouldn
t
i
be
frivolous
if
i
want
one
has
a
right
to
be
frivolous
if
it
s
one
s
nature
no
i
don
t
care
for
the
great
questions
i
care
for
pleasure
for
amusement
perhaps
i
am
fond
of
wicked
things
it
is
very
possible
mr
brand
remained
staring
he
was
even
a
little
pale
as
if
he
had
been
frightened
i
don
t
think
you
know
what
you
are
saying
he
exclaimed
perhaps
not
perhaps
i
am
talking
nonsense
but
it
is
only
with
you
that
i
talk
nonsense
i
never
do
so
with
my
i
will
speak
to
you
again
when
you
are
less
excited
said
mr
brand
i
am
always
excited
when
you
speak
to
me
i
must
tell
you
that
even
if
it
prevents
you
altogether
in
future
your
speaking
to
me
irritates
me
with
my
cousin
it
is
very
different
that
seems
quiet
and
he
looked
at
her
and
then
he
looked
away
with
a
kind
of
helpless
distress
at
the
dusky
garden
and
the
faint
summer
stars
after
which
suddenly
turning
back
gertrude
gertrude
he
softly
groaned
am
i
really
losing
you
she
was
touched
she
was
pained
but
it
had
already
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
do
something
better
than
say
so
it
would
not
have
alleviated
her
companion
s
distress
to
perceive
just
then
whence
she
had
sympathetically
borrowed
this
ingenuity
i
am
not
sorry
for
you
gertrude
said
for
in
paying
so
much
attention
to
me
you
are
following
a
shadow
you
are
wasting
something
precious
there
is
something
else
you
might
have
that
you
don
t
look
at
something
better
than
i
am
that
is
a
reality
and
then
with
intention
she
looked
at
him
and
tried
to
smile
a
little
he
thought
this
smile
of
hers
very
strange
but
she
turned
away
and
left
him
she
wandered
about
alone
in
the
garden
wondering
what
mr
brand
would
make
of
her
words
which
it
had
been
a
singular
pleasure
for
her
to
utter
shortly
after
passing
in
front
of
the
house
she
saw
at
a
distance
two
persons
standing
near
the
garden
gate
it
was
mr
brand
going
away
and
bidding
to
charlotte
who
had
walked
down
with
him
from
the
house
gertrude
saw
that
the
parting
was
prolonged
then
she
turned
her
back
upon
it
she
had
not
gone
very
far
however
when
she
heard
her
sister
slowly
following
her
she
neither
turned
round
nor
waited
for
her
she
knew
what
charlotte
was
going
to
say
charlotte
who
at
last
overtook
her
in
fact
presently
began
she
had
passed
her
arm
into
gertrude
s
will
you
listen
to
me
dear
if
i
say
something
very
particular
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
said
gertrude
mr
brand
feels
very
oh
gertrude
how
can
you
treat
him
so
charlotte
demanded
and
as
her
sister
made
no
answer
she
added
after
all
he
has
done
for
you
what
has
he
done
for
me
i
wonder
you
can
ask
gertrude
he
has
helped
you
so
you
told
me
so
yourself
a
great
many
times
you
told
me
that
he
helped
you
to
struggle
with
your
your
peculiarities
you
told
me
that
he
had
taught
you
how
to
govern
your
for
a
moment
gertrude
said
nothing
then
was
my
temper
very
bad
she
asked
i
am
not
accusing
you
gertrude
said
charlotte
what
are
you
doing
then
her
sister
demanded
with
a
short
laugh
i
am
pleading
for
mr
brand
reminding
you
of
all
you
owe
i
have
given
it
all
back
said
gertrude
still
with
her
little
laugh
he
can
take
back
the
virtue
he
imparted
i
want
to
be
wicked
her
sister
made
her
stop
in
the
path
and
fixed
upon
her
in
the
darkness
a
sweet
reproachful
gaze
if
you
talk
this
way
i
shall
almost
believe
it
think
of
all
we
owe
mr
brand
think
of
how
he
has
always
expected
something
of
you
think
how
much
he
has
been
to
us
think
of
his
beautiful
influence
upon
he
is
very
good
said
gertrude
looking
at
her
sister
i
know
he
is
very
good
but
he
shouldn
t
speak
against
felix
is
good
charlotte
answered
softly
but
promptly
felix
is
very
wonderful
only
he
is
so
different
mr
brand
is
much
nearer
to
us
i
should
never
think
of
going
to
felix
with
a
trouble
with
a
question
mr
brand
is
much
more
to
us
he
is
very
very
good
gertrude
repeated
he
is
more
to
you
yes
much
more
charlotte
she
added
suddenly
you
are
in
love
with
him
oh
gertrude
cried
poor
charlotte
and
her
sister
saw
her
blushing
in
the
darkness
gertrude
put
her
arm
round
her
i
wish
he
would
marry
you
she
went
on
charlotte
shook
herself
free
you
must
not
say
such
things
she
exclaimed
beneath
her
breath
you
like
him
more
than
you
say
and
he
likes
you
more
than
he
this
is
very
cruel
of
you
charlotte
wentworth
murmured
but
if
it
was
cruel
gertrude
continued
pitiless
not
if
it
s
true
she
answered
i
wish
he
would
marry
please
don
t
say
i
mean
to
tell
him
so
said
gertrude
oh
gertrude
gertrude
her
sister
almost
moaned
yes
if
he
speaks
to
me
again
about
myself
i
will
say
why
don
t
you
marry
charlotte
she
s
a
thousand
times
better
than
you
wicked
you
changed
cried
her
sister
if
you
don
t
like
it
you
can
prevent
it
said
gertrude
you
can
prevent
it
by
keeping
him
from
speaking
to
me
and
with
this
she
walked
away
very
conscious
of
what
she
had
done
measuring
it
and
finding
a
certain
joy
and
a
quickened
sense
of
freedom
in
it
wentworth
was
rather
wide
of
the
mark
in
suspecting
that
clifford
had
begun
to
pay
unscrupulous
compliments
to
his
brilliant
cousin
for
the
young
man
had
really
more
scruples
than
he
received
credit
for
in
his
family
he
had
a
certain
transparent
shamefacedness
which
was
in
itself
a
proof
that
he
was
not
at
his
ease
in
dissipation
his
collegiate
peccadilloes
had
aroused
a
domestic
murmur
as
disagreeable
to
the
young
man
as
the
creaking
of
his
boots
would
have
been
to
a
only
as
the
would
have
simplified
matters
by
removing
his
it
had
seemed
to
clifford
that
the
shortest
cut
to
comfortable
relations
with
people
relations
which
should
make
him
cease
to
think
that
when
they
spoke
to
him
they
meant
something
improving
was
to
renounce
all
ambition
toward
a
nefarious
development
and
in
fact
clifford
s
ambition
took
the
most
commendable
form
he
thought
of
himself
in
the
future
as
the
and
wentworth
of
boston
who
should
in
the
natural
course
of
prosperity
have
married
his
pretty
cousin
lizzie
acton
should
live
in
a
house
in
view
of
the
common
and
should
drive
behind
a
light
wagon
over
the
damp
autumn
roads
a
pair
of
beautifully
matched
sorrel
horses
clifford
s
vision
of
the
coming
years
was
very
simple
its
most
definite
features
were
this
element
of
familiar
matrimony
and
the
duplication
of
his
resources
for
trotting
he
had
not
yet
asked
his
cousin
to
marry
him
but
he
meant
to
do
so
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
degree
lizzie
was
serenely
conscious
of
his
intention
and
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
he
would
improve
her
brother
who
was
very
fond
of
this
light
quick
competent
little
lizzie
saw
on
his
side
no
reason
to
interpose
it
seemed
to
him
a
graceful
social
law
that
clifford
and
his
sister
should
become
engaged
he
himself
was
not
engaged
but
everyone
else
fortunately
was
not
such
a
fool
as
he
he
was
fond
of
clifford
as
well
and
had
his
own
way
of
which
it
must
be
confessed
he
was
a
little
ashamed
of
looking
at
those
aberrations
which
had
led
to
the
young
man
s
compulsory
retirement
from
the
neighboring
seat
of
learning
acton
had
seen
the
world
as
he
said
to
himself
he
had
been
to
china
and
had
knocked
about
among
men
he
had
learned
the
essential
difference
between
a
nice
young
fellow
and
a
mean
young
fellow
and
was
satisfied
that
there
was
no
harm
in
clifford
he
believed
although
it
must
be
added
that
he
had
not
quite
the
courage
to
declare
it
in
the
doctrine
of
wild
oats
and
thought
it
a
useful
preventive
of
superfluous
fears
if
wentworth
and
charlotte
and
mr
brand
would
only
apply
it
in
clifford
s
case
they
would
be
happier
and
acton
thought
it
a
pity
they
should
not
be
happier
they
took
the
boy
s
misdemeanors
too
much
to
heart
they
talked
to
him
too
solemnly
they
frightened
and
bewildered
him
of
course
there
was
the
great
standard
of
morality
which
forbade
that
a
man
should
get
tipsy
play
at
billiards
for
money
or
cultivate
his
sensual
consciousness
but
what
fear
was
there
that
poor
clifford
was
going
to
run
a
tilt
at
any
great
standard
it
had
however
never
occurred
to
acton
to
dedicate
the
baroness
münster
to
the
redemption
of
a
refractory
collegian
the
instrument
here
would
have
seemed
to
him
quite
too
complex
for
the
operation
felix
on
the
other
hand
had
spoken
in
obedience
to
the
belief
that
the
more
charming
a
woman
is
the
more
numerous
literally
are
her
definite
social
uses
eugenia
herself
as
we
know
had
plenty
of
leisure
to
enumerate
her
uses
as
i
have
had
the
honor
of
intimating
she
had
come
four
thousand
miles
to
seek
her
fortune
and
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
after
this
great
effort
she
could
neglect
any
apparent
aid
to
advancement
it
is
my
misfortune
that
in
attempting
to
describe
in
a
short
compass
the
deportment
of
this
remarkable
woman
i
am
obliged
to
express
things
rather
brutally
i
feel
this
to
be
the
case
for
instance
when
i
say
that
she
had
primarily
detected
such
an
aid
to
advancement
in
the
person
of
robert
acton
but
that
she
had
afterwards
remembered
that
a
prudent
archer
has
always
a
second
bowstring
eugenia
was
a
woman
of
motive
and
her
intentions
were
never
sensibly
gross
she
had
a
sort
of
aesthetic
ideal
for
clifford
which
seemed
to
her
a
disinterested
reason
for
taking
him
in
hand
it
was
very
well
for
a
young
gentleman
to
be
ingenuous
but
clifford
really
was
crude
with
such
a
pretty
face
he
ought
to
have
prettier
manners
she
would
teach
him
that
with
a
beautiful
name
the
expectation
of
a
large
property
and
as
they
said
in
europe
a
social
position
an
only
son
should
know
how
to
carry
himself
once
clifford
had
begun
to
come
and
see
her
by
himself
and
for
himself
he
came
very
often
he
hardly
knew
why
he
should
come
he
saw
her
almost
every
evening
at
his
father
s
house
he
had
nothing
particular
to
say
to
her
she
was
not
a
young
girl
and
fellows
of
his
age
called
only
upon
young
girls
he
exaggerated
her
age
she
seemed
to
him
an
old
woman
it
was
happy
that
the
baroness
with
all
her
intelligence
was
incapable
of
guessing
this
but
gradually
it
struck
clifford
that
visiting
old
women
might
be
if
not
a
natural
at
least
as
they
say
of
some
articles
of
diet
an
acquired
taste
the
baroness
was
certainly
a
very
amusing
old
woman
she
talked
to
him
as
no
lady
and
indeed
no
gentleman
had
ever
talked
to
him
before
you
should
go
to
europe
and
make
the
tour
she
said
to
him
one
afternoon
of
course
on
leaving
college
you
will
i
don
t
want
to
go
clifford
declared
i
know
some
fellows
who
have
been
to
europe
they
say
you
can
have
better
fun
that
depends
it
depends
upon
your
idea
of
fun
your
friends
probably
were
not
introduced
clifford
demanded
they
had
no
opportunity
of
going
into
society
they
formed
no
this
was
one
of
a
certain
number
of
words
that
the
baroness
often
pronounced
in
the
french
manner
they
went
to
a
ball
in
paris
i
know
that
said
clifford
ah
there
are
balls
and
balls
especially
in
paris
no
you
must
go
you
know
it
is
not
a
thing
from
which
you
can
dispense
yourself
you
need
oh
i
m
very
well
said
clifford
i
m
not
i
don
t
mean
for
your
health
my
poor
child
i
mean
for
your
i
haven
t
got
any
manners
growled
clifford
precisely
you
don
t
mind
my
assenting
to
that
eh
asked
the
baroness
with
a
smile
you
must
go
to
europe
and
get
a
few
you
can
get
them
better
there
it
is
a
pity
you
might
not
have
come
while
i
was
living
in
in
germany
i
would
have
introduced
you
i
had
a
charming
little
circle
you
would
perhaps
have
been
rather
young
but
the
younger
one
begins
i
think
the
better
now
at
any
rate
you
have
no
time
to
lose
and
when
i
return
you
must
immediately
come
to
all
this
to
clifford
s
apprehension
was
a
great
mixture
his
beginning
young
eugenia
s
return
to
europe
his
being
introduced
to
her
charming
little
circle
what
was
he
to
begin
and
what
was
her
little
circle
his
ideas
about
her
marriage
had
a
good
deal
of
vagueness
but
they
were
in
so
far
definite
as
that
he
felt
it
to
be
a
matter
not
to
be
freely
mentioned
he
sat
and
looked
all
round
the
room
he
supposed
she
was
alluding
in
some
way
to
her
marriage
oh
i
don
t
want
to
go
to
germany
he
said
it
seemed
to
him
the
most
convenient
thing
to
say
she
looked
at
him
a
while
smiling
with
her
lips
but
not
with
her
eyes
you
have
scruples
she
asked
scruples
said
clifford
you
young
people
here
are
very
singular
one
doesn
t
know
where
to
expect
you
when
you
are
not
extremely
improper
you
are
so
terribly
proper
i
dare
say
you
think
that
owing
to
my
irregular
marriage
i
live
with
loose
people
you
were
never
more
mistaken
i
have
been
all
the
more
oh
no
said
clifford
honestly
distressed
i
never
thought
such
a
thing
as
are
you
very
sure
i
am
convinced
that
your
father
does
and
your
sisters
they
say
to
each
other
that
here
i
am
on
my
good
behavior
but
that
over
there
married
by
the
left
hand
i
associate
with
light
oh
no
cried
clifford
energetically
they
don
t
say
such
things
as
that
to
each
other
if
they
think
them
they
had
better
say
them
the
baroness
rejoined
then
they
can
be
contradicted
please
contradict
that
whenever
you
hear
it
and
don
t
be
afraid
of
coming
to
see
me
on
account
of
the
company
i
keep
i
have
the
honor
of
knowing
more
distinguished
men
my
poor
child
than
you
are
likely
to
see
in
a
i
see
very
few
women
but
those
are
women
of
rank
so
my
dear
young
puritan
you
needn
t
be
afraid
i
am
not
in
the
least
one
of
those
who
think
that
the
society
of
women
who
have
lost
their
place
in
the
is
necessary
to
form
a
young
man
i
have
never
taken
that
tone
i
have
kept
my
place
myself
and
i
think
we
are
a
much
better
school
than
the
others
trust
me
clifford
and
i
will
prove
that
to
you
the
baroness
continued
while
she
made
the
agreeable
reflection
that
she
could
not
at
least
be
accused
of
perverting
her
young
kinsman
so
if
you
ever
fall
among
thieves
don
t
go
about
saying
i
sent
you
to
clifford
thought
it
so
comical
that
he
should
know
in
spite
of
her
figurative
language
what
she
meant
and
that
she
should
mean
what
he
knew
that
he
could
hardly
help
laughing
a
little
although
he
tried
hard
oh
no
oh
no
he
murmured
laugh
out
laugh
out
if
i
amuse
you
cried
the
baroness
i
am
here
for
that
and
clifford
thought
her
a
very
amusing
person
indeed
but
remember
she
said
on
this
occasion
that
you
are
coming
next
year
to
pay
me
a
visit
over
about
a
week
afterwards
she
said
to
him
are
you
seriously
making
love
to
your
little
cousin
seriously
making
love
these
words
on
madame
münster
s
lips
had
to
clifford
s
sense
a
portentous
and
embarrassing
sound
he
hesitated
about
assenting
lest
he
should
commit
himself
to
more
than
he
understood
well
i
shouldn
t
say
it
if
i
was
he
exclaimed
why
wouldn
t
you
say
it
the
baroness
demanded
those
things
ought
to
be
i
don
t
care
whether
it
is
known
or
not
clifford
rejoined
but
i
don
t
want
people
looking
at
a
young
man
of
your
importance
ought
to
learn
to
bear
observation
to
carry
himself
as
if
he
were
quite
indifferent
to
it
i
won
t
say
exactly
unconscious
the
baroness
explained
no
he
must
seem
to
know
he
is
observed
and
to
think
it
natural
he
should
be
but
he
must
appear
perfectly
used
to
it
now
you
haven
t
that
clifford
you
haven
t
that
at
all
you
must
have
that
you
know
don
t
tell
me
you
are
not
a
young
man
of
importance
eugenia
added
don
t
say
anything
so
flat
as
oh
no
you
don
t
catch
me
saying
that
cried
clifford
yes
you
must
come
to
germany
madame
münster
continued
i
will
show
you
how
people
can
be
talked
about
and
yet
not
seem
to
know
it
you
will
be
talked
about
of
course
with
me
it
will
be
said
you
are
my
lover
i
will
show
you
how
little
one
may
mind
that
how
little
i
shall
mind
clifford
sat
staring
blushing
and
laughing
i
shall
mind
it
a
good
deal
he
declared
ah
not
too
much
you
know
that
would
be
uncivil
but
i
give
you
leave
to
mind
it
a
little
especially
if
you
have
a
passion
for
miss
acton
as
regards
that
you
either
have
or
you
have
not
it
is
very
simple
to
say
i
don
t
see
why
you
want
to
know
said
clifford
you
ought
to
want
me
to
know
if
one
is
arranging
a
marriage
one
tells
one
s
oh
i
m
not
arranging
anything
said
clifford
you
don
t
intend
to
marry
your
cousin
well
i
expect
i
shall
do
as
i
choose
the
baroness
leaned
her
head
upon
the
back
of
her
chair
and
closed
her
eyes
as
if
she
were
tired
then
opening
them
again
your
cousin
is
very
charming
she
said
she
is
the
prettiest
girl
in
this
place
clifford
rejoined
in
this
place
is
saying
little
she
would
be
charming
anywhere
i
am
afraid
you
are
oh
no
i
m
not
are
you
engaged
at
your
age
that
is
the
same
clifford
looked
at
the
baroness
with
some
audacity
will
you
tell
no
one
if
it
s
as
sacred
as
that
well
then
we
are
not
said
clifford
that
s
the
great
secret
that
you
are
not
eh
asked
the
baroness
with
a
quick
laugh
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
you
are
altogether
too
young
a
young
man
in
your
position
must
choose
and
compare
he
must
see
the
world
first
depend
upon
it
she
added
you
should
not
settle
that
matter
before
you
have
come
abroad
and
paid
me
that
visit
there
are
several
things
i
should
like
to
call
your
attention
to
well
i
am
rather
afraid
of
that
visit
said
clifford
it
seems
to
me
it
will
be
rather
like
going
to
school
the
baroness
looked
at
him
a
moment
my
dear
child
she
said
there
is
no
agreeable
man
who
has
not
at
some
moment
been
to
school
to
a
clever
woman
probably
a
little
older
than
himself
and
you
must
be
thankful
when
you
get
your
instructions
gratis
with
me
you
would
get
it
the
next
day
clifford
told
lizzie
acton
that
the
baroness
thought
her
the
most
charming
girl
she
had
ever
seen
lizzie
shook
her
head
no
she
doesn
t
she
said
do
you
think
everything
she
says
asked
clifford
is
to
be
taken
the
opposite
way
i
think
that
is
said
lizzie
clifford
was
going
to
remark
that
in
this
case
the
baroness
must
desire
greatly
to
bring
about
a
marriage
between
clifford
wentworth
and
miss
elizabeth
acton
but
he
resolved
on
the
whole
to
suppress
this
observation
chapter
ix
it
seemed
to
robert
acton
after
eugenia
had
come
to
his
house
that
something
had
passed
between
them
which
made
them
a
good
deal
more
intimate
it
was
hard
to
say
exactly
what
except
her
telling
him
that
she
had
taken
her
resolution
with
regard
to
the
prince
adolf
for
madame
münster
s
visit
had
made
no
difference
in
their
relations
he
came
to
see
her
very
often
but
he
had
come
to
see
her
very
often
before
it
was
agreeable
to
him
to
find
himself
in
her
little
but
this
was
not
a
new
discovery
there
was
a
change
however
in
this
sense
that
if
the
baroness
had
been
a
great
deal
in
acton
s
thoughts
before
she
was
now
never
out
of
them
from
the
first
she
had
been
personally
fascinating
but
the
fascination
now
had
become
intellectual
as
well
he
was
constantly
pondering
her
words
and
motions
they
were
as
interesting
as
the
factors
in
an
algebraic
problem
this
is
saying
a
good
deal
for
acton
was
extremely
fond
of
mathematics
he
asked
himself
whether
it
could
be
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
and
then
hoped
he
was
not
hoped
it
not
so
much
for
his
own
sake
as
for
that
of
the
amatory
passion
itself
if
this
was
love
love
had
been
overrated
love
was
a
poetic
impulse
and
his
own
state
of
feeling
with
regard
to
the
baroness
was
largely
characterized
by
that
eminently
prosaic
sentiment
curiosity
it
was
true
as
acton
with
his
quietly
cogitative
habit
observed
to
himself
that
curiosity
pushed
to
a
given
point
might
become
a
romantic
passion
and
he
certainly
thought
enough
about
this
charming
woman
to
make
him
restless
and
even
a
little
melancholy
it
puzzled
and
vexed
him
at
times
to
feel
that
he
was
not
more
ardent
he
was
not
in
the
least
bent
upon
remaining
a
bachelor
in
his
younger
years
he
had
been
or
he
had
tried
to
be
of
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
a
good
deal
jollier
not
to
marry
and
he
had
flattered
himself
that
his
single
condition
was
something
of
a
citadel
it
was
a
citadel
at
all
events
of
which
he
had
long
since
leveled
the
outworks
he
had
removed
the
guns
from
the
ramparts
he
had
lowered
the
across
the
moat
the
had
swayed
lightly
under
madame
münster
s
step
why
should
he
not
cause
it
to
be
raised
again
so
that
she
might
be
kept
prisoner
he
had
an
idea
that
she
would
become
in
time
at
least
and
on
learning
the
conveniences
of
the
place
for
making
a
lady
comfortable
a
tolerably
patient
captive
but
the
was
never
raised
and
acton
s
brilliant
visitor
was
as
free
to
depart
as
she
had
been
to
come
it
was
part
of
his
curiosity
to
know
why
the
deuce
so
susceptible
a
man
was
in
love
with
so
charming
a
woman
if
her
various
graces
were
as
i
have
said
the
factors
in
an
algebraic
problem
the
answer
to
this
question
was
the
indispensable
unknown
quantity
the
pursuit
of
the
unknown
quantity
was
extremely
absorbing
for
the
present
it
taxed
all
acton
s
faculties
toward
the
middle
of
august
he
was
obliged
to
leave
home
for
some
days
an
old
friend
with
whom
he
had
been
associated
in
china
had
begged
him
to
come
to
newport
where
he
lay
extremely
his
friend
got
better
and
at
the
end
of
a
week
acton
was
released
i
use
the
word
released
advisedly
for
in
spite
of
his
attachment
to
his
chinese
comrade
he
had
been
but
a
visitor
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
called
away
from
the
theatre
during
the
progress
of
a
remarkably
interesting
drama
the
curtain
was
up
all
this
time
and
he
was
losing
the
fourth
act
that
fourth
act
which
would
have
been
so
essential
to
a
just
appreciation
of
the
fifth
in
other
words
he
was
thinking
about
the
baroness
who
seen
at
this
distance
seemed
a
truly
brilliant
figure
he
saw
at
newport
a
great
many
pretty
women
who
certainly
were
figures
as
brilliant
as
beautiful
light
dresses
could
make
them
but
though
they
talked
a
great
deal
and
the
baroness
s
strong
point
was
perhaps
also
her
conversation
madame
münster
appeared
to
lose
nothing
by
the
comparison
he
wished
she
had
come
to
newport
too
would
it
not
be
possible
to
make
up
as
they
said
a
party
for
visiting
the
famous
and
invite
eugenia
to
join
it
it
was
true
that
the
complete
satisfaction
would
be
to
spend
a
fortnight
at
newport
with
eugenia
alone
it
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
see
her
in
society
carry
everything
before
her
as
he
was
sure
she
would
do
when
acton
caught
himself
thinking
these
thoughts
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
frowning
a
little
and
looking
at
the
floor
what
did
it
prove
for
it
certainly
proved
something
this
lively
disposition
to
be
off
somewhere
with
madame
münster
away
from
all
the
rest
of
them
such
a
vision
certainly
seemed
a
refined
implication
of
matrimony
after
the
baroness
should
have
formally
got
rid
of
her
informal
husband
at
any
rate
acton
with
his
characteristic
discretion
forbore
to
give
expression
to
whatever
else
it
might
imply
and
the
narrator
of
these
incidents
is
not
obliged
to
be
more
definite
he
returned
home
rapidly
and
arriving
in
the
afternoon
lost
as
little
time
as
possible
in
joining
the
familiar
circle
at
wentworth
s
on
reaching
the
house
however
he
found
the
piazzas
empty
the
doors
and
windows
were
open
and
their
emptiness
was
made
clear
by
the
shafts
of
from
the
parlors
entering
the
house
he
found
wentworth
sitting
alone
in
one
of
these
apartments
engaged
in
the
perusal
of
the
american
after
they
had
exchanged
greetings
and
his
cousin
had
made
discreet
inquiry
about
his
journey
acton
asked
what
had
become
of
wentworth
s
companions
they
are
scattered
about
amusing
themselves
as
usual
said
the
old
man
i
saw
charlotte
a
short
time
since
seated
with
mr
brand
upon
the
piazza
they
were
conversing
with
their
customary
animation
i
suppose
they
have
joined
her
sister
who
for
the
hundredth
time
was
doing
the
honors
of
the
garden
to
her
foreign
i
suppose
you
mean
felix
said
acton
and
on
wentworth
s
assenting
he
said
and
the
others
your
sister
has
not
come
this
evening
you
must
have
seen
her
at
home
said
wentworth
yes
i
proposed
to
her
to
come
she
lizzie
i
suppose
was
expecting
a
visitor
said
the
old
man
with
a
kind
of
solemn
slyness
if
she
was
expecting
clifford
he
had
not
turned
wentworth
at
this
intelligence
closed
the
american
and
remarked
that
he
had
understood
clifford
to
say
that
he
was
going
to
see
his
cousin
privately
he
reflected
that
if
lizzie
acton
had
had
no
news
of
his
son
clifford
must
have
gone
to
boston
for
the
evening
an
unnatural
course
of
a
summer
night
especially
when
accompanied
with
disingenuous
representations
you
must
remember
that
he
has
two
cousins
said
acton
laughing
and
then
coming
to
the
point
if
lizzie
is
not
here
he
added
neither
apparently
is
the
wentworth
stared
a
moment
and
remembered
that
queer
proposition
of
felix
s
for
a
moment
he
did
not
know
whether
it
was
not
to
be
wished
that
clifford
after
all
might
have
gone
to
boston
the
baroness
has
not
honored
us
tonight
he
said
she
has
not
come
over
for
three
is
she
ill
acton
asked
no
i
have
been
to
see
what
is
the
matter
with
her
well
said
wentworth
i
infer
she
has
tired
of
acton
pretended
to
sit
down
but
he
was
restless
he
found
it
impossible
to
talk
with
wentworth
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
he
took
up
his
hat
and
said
that
he
thought
he
would
go
it
was
very
late
it
was
ten
o
clock
his
kinsman
looked
at
him
a
moment
are
you
going
home
he
asked
acton
hesitated
and
then
answered
that
he
had
proposed
to
go
over
and
take
a
look
at
the
baroness
well
you
are
honest
at
least
said
wentworth
sadly
so
are
you
if
you
come
to
that
cried
acton
laughing
why
shouldn
t
i
be
honest
the
old
man
opened
the
again
and
read
a
few
lines
if
we
have
ever
had
any
virtue
among
us
we
had
better
keep
hold
of
it
now
he
said
he
was
not
quoting
we
have
a
baroness
among
us
said
acton
that
s
what
we
must
keep
hold
of
he
was
too
impatient
to
see
madame
münster
again
to
wonder
what
wentworth
was
talking
about
nevertheless
after
he
had
passed
out
of
the
house
and
traversed
the
garden
and
the
little
piece
of
road
that
separated
him
from
eugenia
s
provisional
residence
he
stopped
a
moment
outside
he
stood
in
her
little
garden
the
long
window
of
her
parlor
was
open
and
he
could
see
the
white
curtains
with
the
shining
through
them
swaying
softly
to
and
fro
in
the
warm
night
wind
there
was
a
sort
of
excitement
in
the
idea
of
seeing
madame
münster
again
he
became
aware
that
his
heart
was
beating
rather
faster
than
usual
it
was
this
that
made
him
stop
with
a
surprise
but
in
a
moment
he
went
along
the
piazza
and
approaching
the
open
window
tapped
upon
its
lintel
with
his
stick
he
could
see
the
baroness
within
she
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
she
came
to
the
window
and
pulled
aside
the
curtain
then
she
stood
looking
at
him
a
moment
she
was
not
smiling
she
seemed
serious
mais
entrez
donc
she
said
at
last
acton
passed
in
across
the
he
wondered
for
an
instant
what
was
the
matter
with
her
but
the
next
moment
she
had
begun
to
smile
and
had
put
out
her
hand
better
late
than
never
she
said
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
come
at
this
i
have
just
returned
from
my
journey
said
acton
ah
very
kind
very
kind
she
repeated
looking
about
her
where
to
sit
i
went
first
to
the
other
house
acton
continued
i
expected
to
find
you
she
had
sunk
into
her
usual
chair
but
she
got
up
again
and
began
to
move
about
the
room
acton
had
laid
down
his
hat
and
stick
he
was
looking
at
her
conscious
that
there
was
in
fact
a
great
charm
in
seeing
her
again
i
don
t
know
whether
i
ought
to
tell
you
to
sit
down
she
said
it
is
too
late
to
begin
a
it
s
too
early
to
end
one
acton
declared
and
we
needn
t
mind
the
she
looked
at
him
again
and
after
a
moment
dropped
once
more
into
her
low
chair
while
he
took
a
place
near
her
we
are
in
the
middle
then
she
asked
was
that
where
we
were
when
you
went
away
no
i
haven
t
been
to
the
other
not
yesterday
nor
the
day
before
eh
i
don
t
know
how
many
days
it
you
are
tired
of
it
said
acton
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
her
arms
were
folded
that
is
a
terrible
accusation
but
i
have
not
the
courage
to
defend
i
am
not
attacking
you
said
acton
i
expected
something
of
this
it
s
a
proof
of
extreme
intelligence
i
hope
you
enjoyed
your
not
at
all
acton
declared
i
would
much
rather
have
been
here
with
now
you
attacking
me
said
the
baroness
you
are
contrasting
my
inconstancy
with
your
own
i
confess
i
never
get
tired
of
people
i
ah
you
are
not
a
poor
wicked
foreign
woman
with
irritable
nerves
and
a
sophisticated
mind
something
has
happened
to
you
since
i
went
away
said
acton
changing
his
place
your
going
away
that
is
what
has
happened
to
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
missed
me
he
asked
if
i
had
meant
to
say
it
it
would
not
be
worth
your
making
a
note
of
i
am
very
dishonest
and
my
compliments
are
acton
was
silent
for
some
moments
you
have
broken
down
he
said
at
last
madame
münster
left
her
chair
and
began
to
move
about
only
for
a
moment
i
shall
pull
myself
together
you
had
better
not
take
it
too
hard
if
you
are
bored
you
needn
t
be
afraid
to
say
so
to
me
at
you
shouldn
t
say
such
things
as
that
the
baroness
answered
you
should
encourage
i
admire
your
patience
that
is
you
shouldn
t
even
say
that
when
you
talk
of
my
patience
you
are
disloyal
to
your
own
people
patience
implies
suffering
and
what
have
i
had
to
suffer
oh
not
hunger
not
unkindness
certainly
said
acton
laughing
nevertheless
we
all
admire
your
you
all
detest
me
cried
the
baroness
with
a
sudden
vehemence
turning
her
back
toward
him
you
make
it
hard
said
acton
getting
up
for
a
man
to
say
something
tender
to
this
evening
there
was
something
particularly
striking
and
touching
about
her
an
unwonted
softness
and
a
look
of
suppressed
emotion
he
felt
himself
suddenly
appreciating
the
fact
that
she
had
behaved
very
well
she
had
come
to
this
quiet
corner
of
the
world
under
the
weight
of
a
cruel
indignity
and
she
had
been
so
gracefully
modestly
thankful
for
the
rest
she
found
there
she
had
joined
that
simple
circle
over
the
way
she
had
mingled
in
its
plain
provincial
talk
she
had
shared
its
meagre
and
savorless
pleasures
she
had
set
herself
a
task
and
she
had
rigidly
performed
it
she
had
conformed
to
the
angular
conditions
of
new
england
life
and
she
had
had
the
tact
and
pluck
to
carry
it
off
as
if
she
liked
them
acton
felt
a
more
downright
need
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
to
tell
her
that
he
admired
her
and
that
she
struck
him
as
a
very
superior
woman
all
along
hitherto
he
had
been
on
his
guard
with
her
he
had
been
cautious
observant
suspicious
but
now
a
certain
light
tumult
in
his
blood
seemed
to
tell
him
that
a
finer
degree
of
confidence
in
this
charming
woman
would
be
its
own
reward
we
don
t
detest
you
he
went
on
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
at
any
rate
i
speak
for
myself
i
don
t
know
anything
about
the
others
very
likely
you
detest
them
for
the
dull
life
they
make
you
lead
really
it
would
give
me
a
sort
of
pleasure
to
hear
you
say
eugenia
had
been
looking
at
the
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
now
she
slowly
turned
her
eyes
toward
robert
acton
what
can
be
the
motive
she
asked
of
a
man
like
you
an
honest
man
a
in
saying
so
base
a
thing
as
that
does
it
sound
very
base
asked
acton
candidly
i
suppose
it
does
and
i
thank
you
for
telling
me
so
of
course
i
don
t
mean
it
the
baroness
stood
looking
at
him
how
do
you
mean
it
she
asked
this
question
was
difficult
to
answer
and
acton
feeling
the
least
bit
foolish
walked
to
the
open
window
and
looked
out
he
stood
there
thinking
a
moment
and
then
he
turned
back
you
know
that
document
that
you
were
to
send
to
germany
he
said
you
called
it
your
did
you
ever
send
it
madame
münster
s
eyes
expanded
she
looked
very
grave
what
a
singular
answer
to
my
question
oh
it
isn
t
an
answer
said
acton
i
have
wished
to
ask
you
many
times
i
thought
it
probable
you
would
tell
me
yourself
the
question
on
my
part
seems
abrupt
now
but
it
would
be
abrupt
at
any
the
baroness
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
i
think
i
have
told
you
too
much
she
said
this
declaration
appeared
to
acton
to
have
a
certain
force
he
had
indeed
a
sense
of
asking
more
of
her
than
he
offered
her
he
returned
to
the
window
and
watched
for
a
moment
a
little
star
that
twinkled
through
the
lattice
of
the
piazza
there
were
at
any
rate
offers
enough
he
could
make
perhaps
he
had
hitherto
not
been
sufficiently
explicit
in
doing
so
i
wish
you
would
ask
something
of
me
he
presently
said
is
there
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
if
you
can
t
stand
this
dull
life
any
more
let
me
amuse
you
the
baroness
had
sunk
once
more
into
a
chair
and
she
had
taken
up
a
fan
which
she
held
with
both
hands
to
her
mouth
over
the
top
of
the
fan
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
you
are
very
strange
tonight
she
said
with
a
little
laugh
i
will
do
anything
in
the
world
he
rejoined
standing
in
front
of
her
shouldn
t
you
like
to
travel
about
and
see
something
of
the
country
won
t
you
go
to
niagara
you
ought
to
see
niagara
you
with
you
do
you
mean
i
should
be
delighted
to
take
you
alone
acton
looked
at
her
smiling
and
yet
with
a
serious
air
well
yes
we
might
go
alone
he
said
if
you
were
not
what
you
are
she
answered
i
should
feel
how
do
you
mean
what
i
am
if
you
were
one
of
the
gentlemen
i
have
been
used
to
all
my
life
if
you
were
not
a
queer
if
the
gentlemen
you
have
been
used
to
have
taught
you
to
expect
insults
said
acton
i
am
glad
i
am
what
i
am
you
had
much
better
come
to
if
you
wish
to
amuse
me
the
baroness
declared
you
need
go
to
no
further
expense
you
amuse
me
very
he
sat
down
opposite
to
her
she
still
held
her
fan
up
to
her
face
with
her
eyes
only
showing
above
it
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
and
then
he
said
returning
to
his
former
question
have
you
sent
that
document
to
germany
again
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
the
expressive
eyes
of
madame
münster
seemed
however
half
to
break
it
i
will
tell
you
at
niagara
she
said
she
had
hardly
spoken
when
the
door
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
opened
the
door
upon
which
some
minutes
previous
eugenia
had
fixed
her
gaze
clifford
wentworth
stood
there
blushing
and
looking
rather
awkward
the
baroness
rose
quickly
and
acton
more
slowly
did
the
same
clifford
gave
him
no
greeting
he
was
looking
at
eugenia
ah
you
were
here
exclaimed
acton
he
was
in
felix
s
studio
said
madame
münster
he
wanted
to
see
his
clifford
looked
at
robert
acton
but
said
nothing
he
only
fanned
himself
with
his
hat
you
chose
a
bad
moment
said
acton
you
hadn
t
much
i
hadn
t
any
said
clifford
laughing
your
candle
went
out
eugenia
asked
you
should
have
come
back
here
and
lighted
it
clifford
looked
at
her
a
moment
so
i
have
come
back
but
i
have
left
the
candle
eugenia
turned
away
you
are
very
stupid
my
poor
boy
you
had
better
go
well
said
clifford
haven
t
you
a
word
to
throw
to
a
man
when
he
has
safely
returned
from
a
dangerous
journey
acton
asked
how
do
you
do
said
clifford
i
thought
i
thought
you
were
and
he
paused
looking
at
the
baroness
again
you
thought
i
was
at
newport
eh
so
i
was
this
clever
child
said
madame
münster
over
her
shoulder
clifford
stared
at
her
not
at
all
like
a
clever
child
and
then
with
one
of
his
little
facetious
growls
took
his
departure
what
is
the
matter
with
him
asked
acton
when
he
was
gone
he
seemed
rather
in
a
eugenia
who
was
near
the
window
glanced
out
listening
a
moment
the
matter
the
matter
she
answered
but
you
don
t
say
such
things
if
you
mean
that
he
had
been
drinking
a
little
you
can
say
he
doesn
t
drink
any
more
i
have
cured
him
and
in
return
he
s
in
love
with
it
was
acton
s
turn
to
stare
he
instantly
thought
of
his
sister
but
he
said
nothing
about
her
he
began
to
laugh
i
don
t
wonder
at
his
passion
but
i
wonder
at
his
forsaking
your
society
for
that
of
your
brother
s
eugenia
was
silent
a
little
he
had
not
been
in
the
studio
i
invented
that
at
the
invented
it
for
what
purpose
he
has
an
idea
of
being
romantic
he
has
adopted
the
habit
of
coming
to
see
me
at
midnight
passing
only
through
the
orchard
and
through
felix
s
which
has
a
door
opening
that
way
it
seems
to
amuse
him
added
eugenia
with
a
little
laugh
acton
felt
more
surprise
than
he
confessed
to
for
this
was
a
new
view
of
clifford
whose
irregularities
had
hitherto
been
quite
without
the
romantic
element
he
tried
to
laugh
again
but
he
felt
rather
too
serious
and
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
his
seriousness
explained
itself
i
hope
you
don
t
encourage
him
he
said
he
must
not
be
inconstant
to
poor
to
your
sister
you
know
they
are
decidedly
intimate
said
acton
ah
cried
eugenia
smiling
has
she
has
she
i
don
t
know
acton
interrupted
what
she
has
but
i
always
supposed
that
clifford
had
a
desire
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
ah
exemple
the
baroness
went
on
the
little
monster
the
next
time
he
becomes
sentimental
i
will
him
tell
that
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
acton
was
silent
a
moment
you
had
better
say
nothing
about
i
had
told
him
as
much
already
on
general
grounds
said
the
baroness
but
in
this
country
you
know
the
relations
of
young
people
are
so
extraordinary
that
one
is
quite
at
sea
they
are
not
engaged
when
you
would
quite
say
they
ought
to
be
take
charlotte
wentworth
for
instance
and
that
young
ecclesiastic
if
i
were
her
father
i
should
insist
upon
his
marrying
her
but
it
appears
to
be
thought
there
is
no
urgency
on
the
other
hand
you
suddenly
learn
that
a
boy
of
twenty
and
a
little
girl
who
is
still
with
her
governess
your
sister
has
no
governess
well
then
who
is
never
away
from
her
mamma
a
young
couple
in
short
between
whom
you
have
noticed
nothing
beyond
an
exchange
of
the
childish
pleasantries
characteristic
of
their
age
are
on
the
point
of
setting
up
as
man
and
the
baroness
spoke
with
a
certain
exaggerated
volubility
which
was
in
contrast
with
the
languid
grace
that
had
characterized
her
manner
before
clifford
made
his
appearance
it
seemed
to
acton
that
there
was
a
spark
of
irritation
in
her
eye
a
note
of
irony
as
when
she
spoke
of
lizzie
being
never
away
from
her
mother
in
her
voice
if
madame
münster
was
irritated
robert
acton
was
vaguely
mystified
she
began
to
move
about
the
room
again
and
he
looked
at
her
without
saying
anything
presently
she
took
out
her
watch
and
glancing
at
it
declared
that
it
was
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
that
he
must
go
i
have
not
been
here
an
hour
he
said
and
they
are
still
sitting
up
at
the
other
house
you
can
see
the
lights
your
brother
has
not
come
oh
at
the
other
house
cried
eugenia
they
are
terrible
people
i
don
t
know
what
they
may
do
over
there
i
am
a
quiet
little
humdrum
woman
i
have
rigid
rules
and
i
keep
them
one
of
them
is
not
to
have
visitors
in
the
small
hours
especially
clever
men
like
you
so
decidedly
the
baroness
was
incisive
and
though
acton
bade
her
and
departed
he
was
still
a
good
deal
mystified
the
next
day
clifford
wentworth
came
to
see
lizzie
and
acton
who
was
at
home
and
saw
him
pass
through
the
garden
took
note
of
the
circumstance
he
had
a
natural
desire
to
make
it
tally
with
madame
münster
s
account
of
clifford
s
disaffection
but
his
ingenuity
finding
itself
unequal
to
the
task
resolved
at
last
to
ask
help
of
the
young
man
s
candor
he
waited
till
he
saw
him
going
away
and
then
he
went
out
and
overtook
him
in
the
grounds
i
wish
very
much
you
would
answer
me
a
question
acton
said
what
were
you
doing
last
night
at
madame
münster
s
clifford
began
to
laugh
and
to
blush
by
no
means
like
a
young
man
with
a
romantic
secret
what
did
she
tell
you
he
asked
that
is
exactly
what
i
don
t
want
to
well
i
want
to
tell
you
the
same
said
clifford
and
unless
i
know
it
perhaps
i
can
they
had
stopped
in
a
garden
path
acton
looked
hard
at
his
rosy
young
kinsman
she
said
she
couldn
t
fancy
what
had
got
into
you
you
appeared
to
have
taken
a
violent
dislike
to
clifford
stared
looking
a
little
alarmed
oh
come
he
growled
you
don
t
mean
that
and
that
when
for
common
civility
s
sake
you
came
occasionally
to
the
house
you
left
her
alone
and
spent
your
time
in
felix
s
studio
under
pretext
of
looking
at
his
oh
come
growled
clifford
again
did
you
ever
know
me
to
tell
an
untruth
yes
lots
of
them
said
clifford
seeing
an
opening
out
of
the
discussion
for
his
sarcastic
powers
well
he
presently
added
i
thought
you
were
my
you
knew
someone
was
there
we
heard
you
coming
acton
meditated
you
had
been
with
the
baroness
then
i
was
in
the
parlor
we
heard
your
step
outside
i
thought
it
was
my
and
on
that
asked
acton
you
ran
away
she
told
me
to
go
to
go
out
by
the
acton
meditated
more
intensely
if
there
had
been
a
chair
at
hand
he
would
have
sat
down
why
should
she
wish
you
not
to
meet
your
father
well
said
clifford
father
doesn
t
like
to
see
me
acton
looked
askance
at
his
companion
and
forbore
to
make
any
comment
upon
this
assertion
has
he
said
so
he
asked
to
the
baroness
well
i
hope
not
said
clifford
he
hasn
t
said
so
in
so
many
words
to
me
but
i
know
it
worries
him
and
i
want
to
stop
worrying
him
the
baroness
knows
it
and
she
wants
me
to
stop
to
stop
coming
to
see
her
i
don
t
know
about
that
but
to
stop
worrying
father
eugenia
knows
everything
clifford
added
with
an
air
of
knowingness
of
his
own
ah
said
acton
interrogatively
eugenia
knows
everything
she
knew
it
was
not
father
coming
then
why
did
you
go
clifford
blushed
and
laughed
afresh
well
i
was
afraid
it
was
and
besides
she
told
me
to
go
at
any
did
she
think
it
was
i
acton
asked
she
didn
t
say
again
robert
acton
reflected
but
you
didn
t
go
he
presently
said
you
came
i
couldn
t
get
out
of
the
studio
clifford
rejoined
the
door
was
locked
and
felix
has
nailed
some
planks
across
the
lower
half
of
the
confounded
windows
to
make
the
light
come
in
from
above
so
they
were
no
use
i
waited
there
a
good
while
and
then
suddenly
i
felt
ashamed
i
didn
t
want
to
be
hiding
away
from
my
own
father
i
couldn
t
stand
it
any
longer
i
bolted
out
and
when
i
found
it
was
you
i
was
a
little
flurried
but
eugenia
carried
it
off
didn
t
she
clifford
added
in
the
tone
of
a
young
humorist
whose
perception
had
not
been
permanently
clouded
by
the
sense
of
his
own
discomfort
beautifully
said
acton
especially
he
continued
when
one
remembers
that
you
were
very
imprudent
and
that
she
must
have
been
a
good
deal
oh
cried
clifford
with
the
indifference
of
a
young
man
who
feels
that
however
he
may
have
failed
of
felicity
in
behavior
he
is
extremely
just
in
his
impressions
eugenia
doesn
t
care
for
anything
acton
hesitated
a
moment
thank
you
for
telling
me
this
he
said
at
last
and
then
laying
his
hand
on
clifford
s
shoulder
he
added
tell
me
one
thing
more
are
you
by
chance
a
little
in
love
with
the
baroness
no
sir
said
clifford
almost
shaking
off
his
hand
chapter
x
the
first
sunday
that
followed
robert
acton
s
return
from
newport
witnessed
a
change
in
the
brilliant
weather
that
had
long
prevailed
the
rain
began
to
fall
and
the
day
was
cold
and
dreary
wentworth
and
his
daughters
put
on
overshoes
and
went
to
church
and
felix
young
without
overshoes
went
also
holding
an
umbrella
over
gertrude
it
is
to
be
feared
that
in
the
whole
observance
this
was
the
privilege
he
most
highly
valued
the
baroness
remained
at
home
she
was
in
neither
a
cheerful
nor
a
devotional
mood
she
had
however
never
been
during
her
residence
in
the
united
states
what
is
called
a
regular
attendant
at
divine
service
and
on
this
particular
sunday
morning
of
which
i
began
with
speaking
she
stood
at
the
window
of
her
little
watching
the
long
arm
of
a
rose
tree
that
was
attached
to
her
piazza
but
a
portion
of
which
had
disengaged
itself
sway
to
and
fro
shake
and
gesticulate
against
the
dusky
drizzle
of
the
sky
every
now
and
then
in
a
gust
of
wind
the
rose
tree
scattered
a
shower
of
against
the
it
appeared
to
have
a
kind
of
human
movement
a
menacing
warning
intention
the
room
was
very
cold
madame
münster
put
on
a
shawl
and
walked
about
then
she
determined
to
have
some
fire
and
summoning
her
ancient
negress
the
contrast
of
whose
polished
ebony
and
whose
crimson
turban
had
been
at
first
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
her
she
made
arrangements
for
the
production
of
a
crackling
flame
this
old
woman
s
name
was
azarina
the
baroness
had
begun
by
thinking
that
there
would
be
a
savory
wildness
in
her
talk
and
for
amusement
she
had
encouraged
her
to
chatter
but
azarina
was
dry
and
prim
her
conversation
was
anything
but
african
she
reminded
eugenia
of
the
tiresome
old
ladies
she
met
in
society
she
knew
however
how
to
make
a
fire
so
that
after
she
had
laid
the
logs
eugenia
who
was
terribly
bored
found
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
entertainment
in
sitting
and
watching
them
blaze
and
sputter
she
had
thought
it
very
likely
robert
acton
would
come
and
see
her
she
had
not
met
him
since
that
infelicitous
evening
but
the
morning
waned
without
his
coming
several
times
she
thought
she
heard
his
step
on
the
piazza
but
it
was
only
a
shaking
in
a
the
baroness
since
the
beginning
of
that
episode
in
her
career
of
which
a
slight
sketch
has
been
attempted
in
these
pages
had
had
many
moments
of
irritation
but
today
her
irritation
had
a
peculiar
keenness
it
appeared
to
feed
upon
itself
it
urged
her
to
do
something
but
it
suggested
no
particularly
profitable
line
of
action
if
she
could
have
done
something
at
the
moment
on
the
spot
she
would
have
stepped
upon
a
european
steamer
and
turned
her
back
with
a
kind
of
rapture
upon
that
profoundly
mortifying
failure
her
visit
to
her
american
relations
it
is
not
exactly
apparent
why
she
should
have
termed
this
enterprise
a
failure
inasmuch
as
she
had
been
treated
with
the
highest
distinction
for
which
allowance
had
been
made
in
american
institutions
her
irritation
came
at
bottom
from
the
sense
which
always
present
had
suddenly
grown
acute
that
the
social
soil
on
this
big
vague
continent
was
somehow
not
adapted
for
growing
those
plants
whose
fragrance
she
especially
inclined
to
inhale
and
by
which
she
liked
to
see
herself
surrounded
a
species
of
vegetation
for
which
she
carried
a
collection
of
seedlings
as
we
may
say
in
her
pocket
she
found
her
chief
happiness
in
the
sense
of
exerting
a
certain
power
and
making
a
certain
impression
and
now
she
felt
the
annoyance
of
a
rather
wearied
swimmer
who
on
nearing
shore
to
land
finds
a
smooth
straight
wall
of
rock
when
he
had
counted
upon
a
clean
firm
beach
her
power
in
the
american
air
seemed
to
have
lost
its
prehensile
attributes
the
smooth
wall
of
rock
was
insurmountable
surely
je
n
en
suis
pas
là
she
said
to
herself
that
i
let
it
make
me
uncomfortable
that
a
robert
acton
shouldn
t
honor
me
with
a
visit
yet
she
was
vexed
that
he
had
not
come
and
she
was
vexed
at
her
vexation
her
brother
at
least
came
in
stamping
in
the
hall
and
shaking
the
wet
from
his
coat
in
a
moment
he
entered
the
room
with
a
glow
in
his
cheek
and
glistening
on
his
moustache
ah
you
have
a
fire
he
said
les
beaux
jours
sont
passés
replied
the
baroness
never
never
they
have
only
begun
felix
declared
planting
himself
before
the
hearth
he
turned
his
back
to
the
fire
placed
his
hands
behind
him
extended
his
legs
and
looked
away
through
the
window
with
an
expression
of
face
which
seemed
to
denote
the
perception
of
even
in
the
tints
of
a
wet
sunday
his
sister
from
her
chair
looked
up
at
him
watching
him
and
what
she
saw
in
his
face
was
not
grateful
to
her
present
mood
she
was
puzzled
by
many
things
but
her
brother
s
disposition
was
a
frequent
source
of
wonder
to
her
i
say
frequent
and
not
constant
for
there
were
long
periods
during
which
she
gave
her
attention
to
other
problems
sometimes
she
had
said
to
herself
that
his
happy
temper
his
eternal
gaiety
was
an
affectation
a
but
she
was
vaguely
conscious
that
during
the
present
summer
he
had
been
a
highly
successful
comedian
they
had
never
yet
had
an
explanation
she
had
not
known
the
need
of
one
felix
was
presumably
following
the
bent
of
his
disinterested
genius
and
she
felt
that
she
had
no
advice
to
give
him
that
he
would
understand
with
this
there
was
always
a
certain
element
of
comfort
about
felix
the
assurance
that
he
would
not
interfere
he
was
very
delicate
this
felix
in
effect
he
was
her
brother
and
madame
münster
felt
that
there
was
a
great
propriety
every
way
in
that
it
is
true
that
felix
was
delicate
he
was
not
fond
of
explanations
with
his
sister
this
was
one
of
the
very
few
things
in
the
world
about
which
he
was
uncomfortable
but
now
he
was
not
thinking
of
anything
uncomfortable
dear
brother
said
eugenia
at
last
do
stop
making
yeux
at
the
with
pleasure
i
will
make
them
at
you
answered
felix
how
much
longer
asked
eugenia
in
a
moment
do
you
propose
to
remain
in
this
lovely
spot
felix
stared
do
you
want
to
go
away
already
already
is
delicious
i
am
not
so
happy
as
felix
dropped
into
a
chair
looking
at
the
fire
the
fact
is
i
happy
he
said
in
his
light
clear
tone
and
do
you
propose
to
spend
your
life
in
making
love
to
gertrude
wentworth
yes
said
felix
smiling
sidewise
at
his
sister
the
baroness
returned
his
glance
much
more
gravely
and
then
do
you
like
her
she
asked
don
t
you
felix
demanded
the
baroness
was
silent
a
moment
i
will
answer
you
in
the
words
of
the
gentleman
who
was
asked
if
he
liked
music
je
ne
la
crains
pas
she
admires
you
immensely
said
felix
i
don
t
care
for
that
other
women
should
not
admire
they
should
dislike
you
again
madame
münster
hesitated
they
should
hate
me
it
s
a
measure
of
the
time
i
have
been
losing
here
that
they
don
no
time
is
lost
in
which
one
has
been
happy
said
felix
with
a
bright
sententiousness
which
may
well
have
been
a
little
irritating
and
in
which
rejoined
his
sister
with
a
harsher
laugh
one
has
secured
the
affections
of
a
young
lady
with
a
fortune
felix
explained
very
candidly
and
seriously
i
have
secured
gertrude
s
affection
but
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
i
have
secured
her
fortune
that
may
come
or
it
may
ah
well
it
that
s
the
great
it
depends
upon
her
father
he
doesn
t
smile
upon
our
union
you
know
he
wants
her
to
marry
i
know
nothing
about
it
cried
the
baroness
please
to
put
on
a
felix
complied
with
her
request
and
sat
watching
the
quickening
of
the
flame
presently
his
sister
added
and
you
propose
to
elope
with
mademoiselle
by
no
means
i
don
t
wish
to
do
anything
that
s
disagreeable
to
wentworth
he
has
been
far
too
kind
to
but
you
must
choose
between
pleasing
yourself
and
pleasing
i
want
to
please
everyone
exclaimed
felix
joyously
i
have
a
good
conscience
i
made
up
my
mind
at
the
outset
that
it
was
not
my
place
to
make
love
to
so
to
simplify
matters
she
made
love
to
you
felix
looked
at
his
sister
with
sudden
gravity
you
say
you
are
not
afraid
of
her
he
said
but
perhaps
you
ought
to
be
a
little
she
s
a
very
clever
i
begin
to
see
it
cried
the
baroness
her
brother
making
no
rejoinder
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
there
was
a
long
silence
at
last
with
an
altered
accent
madame
münster
put
another
question
you
expect
at
any
rate
to
marry
i
shall
be
greatly
disappointed
if
we
don
a
disappointment
or
two
will
do
you
good
the
baroness
declared
and
afterwards
do
you
mean
to
turn
american
it
seems
to
me
i
am
a
very
good
american
already
but
we
shall
go
to
europe
gertrude
wants
extremely
to
see
the
ah
like
me
when
i
came
here
said
the
baroness
with
a
little
laugh
no
not
like
you
felix
rejoined
looking
at
his
sister
with
a
certain
gentle
seriousness
while
he
looked
at
her
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
he
also
got
up
gertrude
is
not
at
all
like
you
he
went
on
but
in
her
own
way
she
is
almost
as
he
paused
a
moment
his
soul
was
full
of
an
agreeable
feeling
and
of
a
lively
disposition
to
express
it
his
sister
to
his
spiritual
vision
was
always
like
the
lunar
disk
when
only
a
part
of
it
is
lighted
the
shadow
on
this
bright
surface
seemed
to
him
to
expand
and
to
contract
but
whatever
its
proportions
he
always
appreciated
the
moonlight
he
looked
at
the
baroness
and
then
he
kissed
her
i
am
very
much
in
love
with
gertrude
he
said
eugenia
turned
away
and
walked
about
the
room
and
felix
continued
she
is
very
interesting
and
very
different
from
what
she
seems
she
has
never
had
a
chance
she
is
very
brilliant
we
will
go
to
europe
and
amuse
the
baroness
had
gone
to
the
window
where
she
stood
looking
out
the
day
was
drearier
than
ever
the
rain
was
doggedly
falling
yes
to
amuse
yourselves
she
said
at
last
you
had
decidedly
better
go
to
europe
then
she
turned
round
looking
at
her
brother
a
chair
stood
near
her
she
leaned
her
hands
upon
the
back
of
it
don
t
you
think
it
is
very
good
of
me
she
asked
to
come
all
this
way
with
you
simply
to
see
you
properly
married
if
properly
it
is
oh
it
will
be
properly
cried
felix
with
light
eagerness
the
baroness
gave
a
little
laugh
you
are
thinking
only
of
yourself
and
you
don
t
answer
my
question
while
you
are
amusing
yourself
with
the
brilliant
gertrude
what
shall
i
be
doing
vous
serez
de
la
partie
cried
felix
thank
you
i
should
spoil
the
baroness
dropped
her
eyes
for
some
moments
do
you
propose
however
to
leave
me
here
she
inquired
felix
smiled
at
her
my
dearest
sister
where
you
are
concerned
i
never
propose
i
execute
your
i
believe
said
eugenia
slowly
that
you
are
the
most
heartless
person
living
don
t
you
see
that
i
am
in
trouble
i
saw
that
you
were
not
cheerful
and
i
gave
you
some
good
well
let
me
give
you
some
news
said
the
baroness
you
probably
will
not
have
discovered
it
for
yourself
robert
acton
wants
to
marry
no
i
had
not
discovered
that
but
i
quite
understand
it
why
does
it
make
you
unhappy
because
i
can
t
accept
him
accept
him
cried
felix
joyously
he
is
the
best
fellow
in
the
he
is
immensely
in
love
with
me
said
the
baroness
and
he
has
a
large
fortune
permit
me
in
turn
to
remind
you
of
oh
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
it
said
eugenia
that
s
a
great
item
in
his
favor
i
am
terribly
and
she
left
her
place
and
came
nearer
her
brother
looking
at
him
hard
he
was
turning
over
several
things
she
was
wondering
in
what
manner
he
really
understood
her
there
were
several
ways
of
understanding
her
there
was
what
she
said
and
there
was
what
she
meant
and
there
was
something
between
the
two
that
was
neither
it
is
probable
that
in
the
last
analysis
what
she
meant
was
that
felix
should
spare
her
the
necessity
of
stating
the
case
more
exactly
and
should
hold
himself
commissioned
to
assist
her
by
all
honorable
means
to
marry
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
but
in
all
this
it
was
never
discovered
what
felix
understood
once
you
have
your
liberty
what
are
your
objections
he
asked
well
i
don
t
particularly
like
oh
try
a
i
am
trying
now
said
eugenia
i
should
succeed
better
if
he
didn
t
live
here
i
could
never
live
make
him
go
to
europe
felix
suggested
ah
there
you
speak
of
happiness
based
upon
violent
effort
the
baroness
rejoined
that
is
not
what
i
am
looking
for
he
would
never
live
in
he
would
live
anywhere
with
you
said
felix
gallantly
his
sister
looked
at
him
still
with
a
ray
of
penetration
in
her
charming
eyes
then
she
turned
away
again
you
see
at
all
events
she
presently
went
on
that
if
it
had
been
said
of
me
that
i
had
come
over
here
to
seek
my
fortune
it
would
have
to
be
added
that
i
have
found
it
don
t
leave
it
lying
urged
felix
with
smiling
solemnity
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
interest
his
sister
declared
after
a
moment
but
promise
me
one
thing
de
zèle
if
acton
should
ask
you
to
plead
his
cause
excuse
i
shall
certainly
have
the
excuse
said
felix
that
i
have
a
cause
of
my
own
to
if
he
should
talk
of
me
favorably
eugenia
continued
warn
him
against
dangerous
illusions
i
detest
importunities
i
want
to
decide
at
my
leisure
with
my
eyes
i
shall
be
discreet
said
felix
except
to
you
to
you
i
will
say
accept
him
she
had
advanced
to
the
open
doorway
and
she
stood
looking
at
him
i
will
go
and
dress
and
think
of
it
she
said
and
he
heard
her
moving
slowly
to
her
apartments
late
in
the
afternoon
the
rain
stopped
and
just
afterwards
there
was
a
great
flaming
flickering
trickling
sunset
felix
sat
in
his
and
did
some
work
but
at
last
as
the
light
which
had
not
been
brilliant
began
to
fade
he
laid
down
his
brushes
and
came
out
to
the
little
piazza
of
the
cottage
here
he
walked
up
and
down
for
some
time
looking
at
the
splendid
blaze
of
the
western
sky
and
saying
as
he
had
often
said
before
that
this
was
certainly
the
country
of
sunsets
there
was
something
in
these
glorious
deeps
of
fire
that
quickened
his
imagination
he
always
found
images
and
promises
in
the
western
sky
he
thought
of
a
good
many
things
of
roaming
about
the
world
with
gertrude
wentworth
he
seemed
to
see
their
possible
adventures
in
a
glowing
frieze
between
the
then
of
what
eugenia
had
just
been
telling
him
he
wished
very
much
that
madame
münster
would
make
a
comfortable
and
honorable
marriage
presently
as
the
sunset
expanded
and
deepened
the
fancy
took
him
of
making
a
note
of
so
magnificent
a
piece
of
coloring
he
returned
to
his
studio
and
fetched
out
a
small
panel
with
his
palette
and
brushes
and
placing
the
panel
against
a
he
began
to
daub
with
great
gusto
while
he
was
so
occupied
he
saw
mr
brand
in
the
distance
slowly
come
down
from
wentworth
s
house
nursing
a
large
folded
umbrella
he
walked
with
a
joyless
meditative
tread
and
his
eyes
were
bent
upon
the
ground
felix
poised
his
brush
for
a
moment
watching
him
then
by
a
sudden
impulse
as
he
drew
nearer
advanced
to
the
and
signaled
to
him
the
palette
and
bunch
of
brushes
contributing
to
this
effect
mr
brand
stopped
and
started
then
he
appeared
to
decide
to
accept
felix
s
invitation
he
came
out
of
wentworth
s
gate
and
passed
along
the
road
after
which
he
entered
the
little
garden
of
the
cottage
felix
had
gone
back
to
his
sunset
but
he
made
his
visitor
welcome
while
he
rapidly
brushed
it
in
i
wanted
so
much
to
speak
to
you
that
i
thought
i
would
call
you
he
said
in
the
friendliest
tone
all
the
more
that
you
have
been
to
see
me
so
little
you
have
come
to
see
my
sister
i
know
that
but
you
haven
t
come
to
see
me
the
celebrated
artist
artists
are
very
sensitive
you
know
they
notice
those
and
felix
turned
round
smiling
with
a
brush
in
his
mouth
mr
brand
stood
there
with
a
certain
blank
candid
majesty
pulling
together
the
large
flaps
of
his
umbrella
why
should
i
come
to
see
you
he
asked
i
know
nothing
of
it
would
sound
very
conceited
i
suppose
said
felix
if
i
were
to
say
that
it
would
be
a
good
little
chance
for
you
to
learn
something
you
would
ask
me
why
you
should
learn
and
i
should
have
no
answer
to
that
i
suppose
a
minister
has
no
need
for
art
eh
he
has
need
for
good
temper
sir
said
mr
brand
with
decision
felix
jumped
up
with
his
palette
on
his
thumb
and
a
movement
of
the
liveliest
deprecation
that
s
because
i
keep
you
standing
there
while
i
splash
my
red
paint
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
you
see
what
bad
manners
art
gives
a
man
and
how
right
you
are
to
let
it
alone
i
didn
t
mean
you
should
stand
either
the
piazza
as
you
see
is
ornamented
with
rustic
chairs
though
indeed
i
ought
to
warn
you
that
they
have
nails
in
the
wrong
places
i
was
just
making
a
note
of
that
sunset
i
never
saw
such
a
blaze
of
different
reds
it
looks
as
if
the
celestial
city
were
in
flames
eh
if
that
were
really
the
case
i
suppose
it
would
be
the
business
of
you
theologians
to
put
out
the
fire
fancy
me
an
ungodly
artist
quietly
sitting
down
to
paint
it
mr
brand
had
always
credited
felix
young
with
a
certain
impudence
but
it
appeared
to
him
that
on
this
occasion
his
impudence
was
so
great
as
to
make
a
special
explanation
or
even
an
apology
necessary
and
the
impression
it
must
be
added
was
sufficiently
natural
felix
had
at
all
times
a
brilliant
assurance
of
manner
which
was
simply
the
vehicle
of
his
good
spirits
and
his
good
will
but
at
present
he
had
a
special
design
and
as
he
would
have
admitted
that
the
design
was
audacious
so
he
was
conscious
of
having
summoned
all
the
arts
of
conversation
to
his
aid
but
he
was
so
far
from
desiring
to
offend
his
visitor
that
he
was
rapidly
asking
himself
what
personal
compliment
he
could
pay
the
young
clergyman
that
would
gratify
him
most
if
he
could
think
of
it
he
was
prepared
to
pay
it
down
have
you
been
preaching
one
of
your
beautiful
sermons
today
he
suddenly
asked
laying
down
his
palette
this
was
not
what
felix
had
been
trying
to
think
of
but
it
was
a
tolerable
mr
brand
frowned
as
much
as
a
man
can
frown
who
has
very
fair
soft
eyebrows
and
beneath
them
very
gentle
tranquil
eyes
no
i
have
not
preached
any
sermon
today
did
you
bring
me
over
here
for
the
purpose
of
making
that
inquiry
felix
saw
that
he
was
irritated
and
he
regretted
it
immensely
but
he
had
no
fear
of
not
being
in
the
end
agreeable
to
mr
brand
he
looked
at
him
smiling
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
arm
no
no
not
for
that
not
for
that
i
wanted
to
ask
you
something
i
wanted
to
tell
you
something
i
am
sure
it
will
interest
you
very
much
only
as
it
is
something
rather
private
we
had
better
come
into
my
little
studio
i
have
a
western
window
we
can
still
see
the
sunset
and
he
gave
a
little
pat
to
his
companion
s
arm
he
led
the
way
in
mr
brand
stiffly
and
softly
followed
the
twilight
had
thickened
in
the
little
studio
but
the
wall
opposite
the
western
window
was
covered
with
a
deep
pink
flush
there
were
a
great
many
sketches
and
canvasses
suspended
in
this
rosy
glow
and
the
corners
of
the
room
were
vague
and
dusky
felix
begged
mr
brand
to
sit
down
then
glancing
round
him
by
jove
how
pretty
it
looks
he
cried
but
mr
brand
would
not
sit
down
he
went
and
leaned
against
the
window
he
wondered
what
felix
wanted
of
him
in
the
shadow
on
the
darker
parts
of
the
wall
he
saw
the
gleam
of
three
or
four
pictures
that
looked
fantastic
and
surprising
they
seemed
to
represent
naked
figures
felix
stood
there
with
his
head
a
little
bent
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
visitor
smiling
intensely
pulling
his
moustache
mr
brand
felt
vaguely
uneasy
it
is
very
delicate
what
i
want
to
say
felix
began
but
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
for
some
please
to
say
it
as
quickly
as
possible
said
mr
brand
it
s
because
you
are
a
clergyman
you
know
felix
went
on
i
don
t
think
i
should
venture
to
say
it
to
a
common
mr
brand
was
silent
a
moment
if
it
is
a
question
of
yielding
to
a
weakness
of
resenting
an
injury
i
am
afraid
i
am
a
very
common
my
dearest
friend
cried
felix
this
is
not
an
injury
it
s
a
benefit
a
great
service
you
will
like
it
extremely
only
it
s
so
delicate
and
in
the
dim
light
he
continued
to
smile
intensely
you
know
i
take
a
great
interest
in
my
cousins
in
charlotte
and
gertrude
wentworth
that
s
very
evident
from
my
having
traveled
some
five
thousand
miles
to
see
mr
brand
said
nothing
and
felix
proceeded
coming
into
their
society
as
a
perfect
stranger
i
received
of
course
a
great
many
new
impressions
and
my
impressions
had
a
great
freshness
a
great
keenness
do
you
know
what
i
mean
i
am
not
sure
that
i
do
but
i
should
like
you
to
i
think
my
impressions
have
always
a
good
deal
of
freshness
said
brand
s
entertainer
but
on
this
occasion
it
was
perhaps
particularly
natural
that
coming
in
as
i
say
from
outside
i
should
be
struck
with
things
that
passed
unnoticed
among
yourselves
and
then
i
had
my
sister
to
help
me
and
she
is
simply
the
most
observant
woman
in
the
i
am
not
surprised
said
mr
brand
that
in
our
little
circle
two
intelligent
persons
should
have
found
food
for
observation
i
am
sure
that
of
late
i
have
found
it
myself
ah
but
i
shall
surprise
you
yet
cried
felix
laughing
both
my
sister
and
i
took
a
great
fancy
to
my
cousin
your
cousin
charlotte
repeated
mr
brand
we
fell
in
love
with
her
from
the
first
you
fell
in
love
with
charlotte
mr
brand
murmured
exclaimed
felix
she
s
a
very
charming
person
and
eugenia
was
especially
mr
brand
stood
staring
and
he
pursued
affection
you
know
opens
one
s
eyes
and
we
noticed
something
charlotte
is
not
happy
charlotte
is
in
and
felix
drawing
nearer
laid
his
hand
again
upon
his
companion
s
arm
there
was
something
akin
to
an
acknowledgment
of
fascination
in
the
way
mr
brand
looked
at
him
but
the
young
clergyman
retained
as
yet
quite
enough
to
be
able
to
say
with
a
good
deal
of
solemnity
she
is
not
in
love
with
felix
gave
a
light
laugh
and
rejoined
with
the
alacrity
of
a
maritime
adventurer
who
feels
a
puff
of
wind
in
his
sail
ah
no
if
she
were
in
love
with
me
i
should
know
it
i
am
not
so
blind
as
as
i
my
dear
sir
you
are
stone
blind
poor
charlotte
is
dead
in
love
with
mr
brand
said
nothing
for
a
moment
he
breathed
a
little
heavily
is
that
what
you
wanted
to
say
to
me
he
asked
i
have
wanted
to
say
it
these
three
weeks
because
of
late
she
has
been
worse
i
told
you
added
felix
it
was
very
well
sir
mr
brand
began
well
sir
i
was
sure
you
didn
t
know
it
felix
continued
but
don
t
you
see
as
soon
as
i
mention
it
how
everything
is
explained
mr
brand
answered
nothing
he
looked
for
a
chair
and
softly
sat
down
felix
could
see
that
he
was
blushing
he
had
looked
straight
at
his
host
hitherto
but
now
he
looked
away
the
foremost
effect
of
what
he
had
heard
had
been
a
sort
of
irritation
of
his
modesty
of
course
said
felix
i
suggest
nothing
it
would
be
very
presumptuous
in
me
to
advise
you
but
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
mr
brand
looked
hard
at
the
floor
for
some
moments
he
was
oppressed
with
a
mixture
of
sensations
felix
standing
there
was
very
sure
that
one
of
them
was
profound
surprise
the
innocent
young
man
had
been
completely
unsuspicious
of
poor
charlotte
s
hidden
flame
this
gave
felix
great
hope
he
was
sure
that
mr
brand
would
be
flattered
felix
thought
him
very
transparent
and
indeed
he
was
so
he
could
neither
simulate
nor
dissimulate
i
scarcely
know
what
to
make
of
this
he
said
at
last
without
looking
up
and
felix
was
struck
with
the
fact
that
he
offered
no
protest
or
contradiction
evidently
felix
had
kindled
a
train
of
memories
a
retrospective
illumination
it
was
making
to
brand
s
astonished
eyes
a
very
pretty
blaze
his
second
emotion
had
been
a
gratification
of
vanity
thank
me
for
telling
you
felix
rejoined
it
s
a
good
thing
to
i
am
not
sure
of
that
said
mr
brand
ah
don
t
let
her
languish
felix
murmured
lightly
and
softly
you
advise
me
then
and
mr
brand
looked
up
i
congratulate
you
said
felix
smiling
he
had
thought
at
first
his
visitor
was
simply
appealing
but
he
saw
he
was
a
little
ironical
it
is
in
your
interest
you
have
interfered
with
me
the
young
clergyman
went
on
felix
still
stood
and
smiled
the
little
room
had
grown
darker
and
the
crimson
glow
had
faded
but
mr
brand
could
see
the
brilliant
expression
of
his
face
i
won
t
pretend
not
to
know
what
you
mean
said
felix
at
last
but
i
have
not
really
interfered
with
you
of
what
you
had
to
lose
with
another
person
you
have
lost
nothing
and
think
what
you
have
gained
it
seems
to
me
i
am
the
proper
judge
on
each
side
mr
brand
declared
he
got
up
holding
the
brim
of
his
hat
against
his
mouth
and
staring
at
felix
through
the
dusk
you
have
lost
an
illusion
said
felix
what
do
you
call
an
illusion
the
belief
that
you
really
know
that
you
have
ever
really
known
gertrude
wentworth
depend
upon
that
pursued
felix
i
don
t
know
her
yet
but
i
have
no
illusions
i
don
t
pretend
mr
brand
kept
gazing
over
his
hat
she
has
always
been
a
lucid
limpid
nature
he
said
solemnly
she
has
always
been
a
dormant
nature
she
was
waiting
for
a
touchstone
but
now
she
is
beginning
to
don
t
praise
her
to
me
said
mr
brand
with
a
little
quaver
in
his
voice
if
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
that
is
not
my
dear
sir
i
am
melting
with
generosity
exclaimed
felix
and
i
am
not
praising
my
cousin
i
am
simply
attempting
a
scientific
definition
of
her
she
doesn
t
care
for
abstractions
now
i
think
the
contrary
is
what
you
have
always
fancied
is
the
basis
on
which
you
have
been
building
she
is
extremely
preoccupied
with
the
concrete
i
care
for
the
concrete
too
but
gertrude
is
stronger
than
i
she
whirls
me
along
mr
brand
looked
for
a
moment
into
the
crown
of
his
hat
it
s
a
most
interesting
so
it
is
said
felix
but
it
pulls
it
pulls
like
a
runaway
horse
now
i
like
the
feeling
of
a
runaway
horse
and
if
i
am
thrown
out
of
the
vehicle
it
is
no
great
matter
but
if
should
be
thrown
brand
and
felix
paused
a
moment
another
person
also
would
suffer
from
the
what
other
person
charlotte
wentworth
mr
brand
looked
at
felix
for
a
moment
sidewise
mistrustfully
then
his
eyes
slowly
wandered
over
the
ceiling
felix
was
sure
he
was
secretly
struck
with
the
romance
of
the
situation
i
think
this
is
none
of
our
business
the
young
minister
murmured
none
of
mine
perhaps
but
surely
yours
mr
brand
lingered
still
looking
at
the
ceiling
there
was
evidently
something
he
wanted
to
say
what
do
you
mean
by
miss
gertrude
being
strong
he
asked
abruptly
well
said
felix
meditatively
i
mean
that
she
has
had
a
great
deal
of
she
was
waiting
for
years
even
when
she
seemed
perhaps
to
be
living
in
the
present
she
knew
how
to
wait
she
had
a
purpose
that
s
what
i
mean
by
her
being
but
what
do
you
mean
by
her
purpose
well
the
purpose
to
see
the
world
mr
brand
eyed
his
strange
informant
askance
again
but
he
said
nothing
at
last
he
turned
away
as
if
to
take
leave
he
seemed
bewildered
however
for
instead
of
going
to
the
door
he
moved
toward
the
opposite
corner
of
the
room
felix
stood
and
watched
him
for
a
moment
almost
groping
about
in
the
dusk
then
he
led
him
to
the
door
with
a
tender
almost
fraternal
movement
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
asked
mr
brand
yes
it
s
all
but
it
will
bear
a
good
deal
of
thinking
felix
went
with
him
to
the
and
watched
him
slowly
walk
away
into
the
thickening
twilight
with
a
relaxed
rigidity
that
tried
to
rectify
itself
he
is
offended
excited
bewildered
perplexed
and
enchanted
felix
said
to
himself
that
s
a
capital
chapter
xi
since
that
visit
paid
by
the
baroness
münster
to
acton
of
which
some
account
was
given
at
an
earlier
stage
of
this
narrative
the
intercourse
between
these
two
ladies
had
been
neither
frequent
nor
intimate
it
was
not
that
acton
had
failed
to
appreciate
madame
münster
s
charms
on
the
contrary
her
perception
of
the
graces
of
manner
and
conversation
of
her
brilliant
visitor
had
been
only
too
acute
acton
was
as
they
said
in
boston
very
intense
and
her
impressions
were
apt
to
be
too
many
for
her
the
state
of
her
health
required
the
restriction
of
emotion
and
this
is
why
receiving
as
she
sat
in
her
eternal
very
few
visitors
even
of
the
soberest
local
type
she
had
been
obliged
to
limit
the
number
of
her
interviews
with
a
lady
whose
costume
and
manner
recalled
to
her
imagination
acton
s
imagination
was
a
marvel
all
that
she
had
ever
read
of
the
most
stirring
historical
periods
but
she
had
sent
the
baroness
a
great
many
messages
and
a
great
many
nosegays
from
her
garden
and
baskets
of
beautiful
fruit
felix
had
eaten
the
fruit
and
the
baroness
had
arranged
the
flowers
and
returned
the
baskets
and
the
messages
on
the
day
that
followed
that
rainy
sunday
of
which
mention
has
been
made
eugenia
determined
to
go
and
pay
the
beneficent
invalid
a
visite
d
adieux
so
it
was
that
to
herself
she
qualified
her
enterprise
it
may
be
noted
that
neither
on
the
sunday
evening
nor
on
the
monday
morning
had
she
received
that
expected
visit
from
robert
acton
to
his
own
consciousness
evidently
he
was
keeping
away
and
as
the
baroness
on
her
side
was
keeping
away
from
her
uncle
s
whither
for
several
days
felix
had
been
the
unembarrassed
bearer
of
apologies
and
regrets
for
absence
chance
had
not
taken
the
cards
from
the
hands
of
design
wentworth
and
his
daughters
had
respected
eugenia
s
seclusion
certain
intervals
of
mysterious
retirement
appeared
to
them
vaguely
a
natural
part
of
the
graceful
rhythmic
movement
of
so
remarkable
a
life
gertrude
especially
held
these
periods
in
honor
she
wondered
what
madame
münster
did
at
such
times
but
she
would
not
have
permitted
herself
to
inquire
too
curiously
the
long
rain
had
freshened
the
air
and
twelve
hours
brilliant
sunshine
had
dried
the
roads
so
that
the
baroness
in
the
late
afternoon
proposing
to
walk
to
acton
s
exposed
herself
to
no
great
discomfort
as
with
her
charming
undulating
step
she
moved
along
the
clean
grassy
margin
of
the
road
beneath
the
boughs
of
the
orchards
through
the
quiet
of
the
hour
and
place
and
the
rich
maturity
of
the
summer
she
was
even
conscious
of
a
sort
of
luxurious
melancholy
the
baroness
had
the
amiable
weakness
of
attaching
herself
to
places
even
when
she
had
begun
with
a
little
aversion
and
now
with
the
prospect
of
departure
she
felt
tenderly
toward
this
corner
of
the
western
world
where
the
sunsets
were
so
beautiful
and
one
s
ambitions
were
so
pure
acton
was
able
to
receive
her
but
on
entering
this
lady
s
large
room
the
baroness
saw
that
she
was
looking
very
she
was
wonderfully
white
and
transparent
and
in
her
flowered
she
made
no
attempt
to
move
but
she
flushed
a
little
like
a
young
girl
the
baroness
thought
and
she
rested
her
clear
smiling
eyes
upon
those
of
her
visitor
her
voice
was
low
and
monotonous
like
a
voice
that
had
never
expressed
any
human
passions
i
have
come
to
bid
you
said
eugenia
i
shall
soon
be
going
when
are
you
going
away
very
soon
any
i
am
very
sorry
said
acton
i
hoped
you
would
stay
always
eugenia
demanded
well
i
mean
a
long
time
said
acton
in
her
sweet
feeble
tone
they
tell
me
you
are
so
comfortable
that
you
have
got
such
a
beautiful
little
eugenia
stared
that
is
she
smiled
she
thought
of
her
poor
little
chalet
and
she
wondered
whether
her
hostess
were
jesting
yes
my
house
is
exquisite
she
said
though
not
to
be
compared
to
and
my
son
is
so
fond
of
going
to
see
you
acton
added
i
am
afraid
my
son
will
miss
ah
dear
madam
said
eugenia
with
a
little
laugh
i
can
t
stay
in
america
for
your
son
don
t
you
like
america
the
baroness
looked
at
the
front
of
her
dress
if
i
liked
it
that
would
not
be
staying
for
your
son
acton
gazed
at
her
with
her
grave
tender
eyes
as
if
she
had
not
quite
understood
the
baroness
at
last
found
something
irritating
in
the
sweet
soft
stare
of
her
hostess
and
if
one
were
not
bound
to
be
merciful
to
great
invalids
she
would
almost
have
taken
the
liberty
of
pronouncing
her
mentally
a
fool
i
am
afraid
then
i
shall
never
see
you
again
said
acton
you
know
i
am
ah
dear
madam
murmured
eugenia
i
want
to
leave
my
children
cheerful
and
happy
my
daughter
will
probably
marry
her
two
such
interesting
young
people
said
the
baroness
vaguely
she
was
not
thinking
of
clifford
wentworth
i
feel
so
tranquil
about
my
end
acton
went
on
it
is
coming
so
easily
so
and
she
paused
with
her
mild
gaze
always
on
eugenia
s
the
baroness
hated
to
be
reminded
of
death
but
even
in
its
imminence
so
far
as
acton
was
concerned
she
preserved
her
good
manners
ah
madam
you
are
too
charming
an
invalid
she
rejoined
but
the
delicacy
of
this
rejoinder
was
apparently
lost
upon
her
hostess
who
went
on
in
her
low
reasonable
voice
i
want
to
leave
my
children
bright
and
comfortable
you
seem
to
me
all
so
happy
here
just
as
you
are
so
i
wish
you
could
stay
it
would
be
so
pleasant
for
eugenia
wondered
what
she
meant
by
its
being
pleasant
for
robert
but
she
felt
that
she
would
never
know
what
such
a
woman
as
that
meant
she
got
up
she
was
afraid
acton
would
tell
her
again
that
she
was
dying
dear
madam
she
said
i
must
remember
that
your
strength
is
acton
took
her
hand
and
held
it
a
moment
well
you
been
happy
here
haven
t
you
and
you
like
us
all
don
t
you
i
wish
you
would
stay
she
added
in
your
beautiful
little
she
had
told
eugenia
that
her
would
be
in
the
hall
to
show
her
downstairs
but
the
large
landing
outside
her
door
was
empty
and
eugenia
stood
there
looking
about
she
felt
irritated
the
dying
lady
had
not
la
main
she
passed
slowly
downstairs
still
looking
about
the
broad
staircase
made
a
great
bend
and
in
the
angle
was
a
high
window
looking
westward
with
a
deep
bench
covered
with
a
row
of
flowering
plants
in
curious
old
pots
of
blue
the
yellow
afternoon
light
came
in
through
the
flowers
and
flickered
a
little
on
the
white
wainscots
eugenia
paused
a
moment
the
house
was
perfectly
still
save
for
the
ticking
somewhere
of
a
great
clock
the
lower
hall
stretched
away
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
half
covered
over
with
a
large
oriental
rug
eugenia
lingered
a
little
noticing
a
great
many
things
comme
c
est
bien
she
said
to
herself
such
a
large
solid
irreproachable
basis
of
existence
the
place
seemed
to
her
to
indicate
and
then
she
reflected
that
acton
was
soon
to
withdraw
from
it
the
reflection
accompanied
her
the
rest
of
the
way
downstairs
where
she
paused
again
making
more
observations
the
hall
was
extremely
broad
and
on
either
side
of
the
front
door
was
a
wide
window
which
threw
the
shadows
of
everything
back
into
the
house
there
were
chairs
along
the
wall
and
big
eastern
vases
upon
tables
and
on
either
side
a
large
cabinet
with
a
glass
front
and
little
curiosities
within
dimly
gleaming
the
doors
were
open
into
the
darkened
parlor
the
library
the
all
these
rooms
seemed
empty
eugenia
passed
along
and
stopped
a
moment
on
the
threshold
of
each
comme
c
est
bien
she
murmured
again
she
had
thought
of
just
such
a
house
as
this
when
she
decided
to
come
to
america
she
opened
the
front
door
for
herself
her
light
tread
had
summoned
none
of
the
servants
and
on
the
threshold
she
gave
a
last
look
outside
she
was
still
in
the
humor
for
curious
contemplation
so
instead
of
going
directly
down
the
little
drive
to
the
gate
she
wandered
away
towards
the
garden
which
lay
to
the
right
of
the
house
she
had
not
gone
many
yards
over
the
grass
before
she
paused
quickly
she
perceived
a
gentleman
stretched
upon
the
level
verdure
beneath
a
tree
he
had
not
heard
her
coming
and
he
lay
motionless
flat
on
his
back
with
his
hands
clasped
under
his
head
staring
up
at
the
sky
so
that
the
baroness
was
able
to
reflect
at
her
leisure
upon
the
question
of
his
identity
it
was
that
of
a
person
who
had
lately
been
much
in
her
thoughts
but
her
first
impulse
nevertheless
was
to
turn
away
the
last
thing
she
desired
was
to
have
the
air
of
coming
in
quest
of
robert
acton
the
gentleman
on
the
grass
however
gave
her
no
time
to
decide
he
could
not
long
remain
unconscious
of
so
agreeable
a
presence
he
rolled
back
his
eyes
stared
gave
an
exclamation
and
then
jumped
up
he
stood
an
instant
looking
at
her
excuse
my
ridiculous
position
he
said
i
have
just
now
no
sense
of
the
ridiculous
but
in
case
you
have
don
t
imagine
i
came
to
see
take
care
rejoined
acton
how
you
put
it
into
my
head
i
was
thinking
of
the
occupation
of
extreme
leisure
said
the
baroness
to
think
of
a
woman
when
you
are
in
that
position
is
no
i
didn
t
say
i
was
thinking
well
acton
affirmed
smiling
she
looked
at
him
and
then
she
turned
away
though
i
didn
t
come
to
see
you
she
said
remember
at
least
that
i
am
within
your
i
am
delighted
i
am
honored
won
t
you
come
into
the
house
i
have
just
come
out
of
it
i
have
been
calling
upon
your
mother
i
have
been
bidding
her
farewell
acton
demanded
i
am
going
away
said
the
baroness
and
she
turned
away
again
as
if
to
illustrate
her
meaning
when
are
you
going
asked
acton
standing
a
moment
in
his
place
but
the
baroness
made
no
answer
and
he
followed
her
i
came
this
way
to
look
at
your
garden
she
said
walking
back
to
the
gate
over
the
grass
but
i
must
let
me
at
least
go
with
he
went
with
her
and
they
said
nothing
till
they
reached
the
gate
it
was
open
and
they
looked
down
the
road
which
was
darkened
over
with
long
bosky
shadows
must
you
go
straight
home
acton
asked
but
she
made
no
answer
she
said
after
a
moment
why
have
you
not
been
to
see
me
he
said
nothing
and
then
she
went
on
why
don
t
you
answer
me
i
am
trying
to
invent
an
answer
acton
confessed
have
you
none
ready
none
that
i
can
tell
you
he
said
but
let
me
walk
with
you
you
may
do
as
you
she
moved
slowly
along
the
road
and
acton
went
with
her
presently
he
said
if
i
had
done
as
i
liked
i
would
have
come
to
see
you
several
is
that
invented
asked
eugenia
no
that
is
natural
i
stayed
away
because
ah
here
comes
the
reason
then
because
i
wanted
to
think
about
because
you
wanted
to
lie
down
said
the
baroness
i
have
seen
you
lie
down
almost
in
my
acton
stopped
in
the
road
with
a
movement
which
seemed
to
beg
her
to
linger
a
little
she
paused
and
he
looked
at
her
awhile
he
thought
her
very
charming
you
are
jesting
he
said
but
if
you
are
really
going
away
it
is
very
if
i
stay
and
she
gave
a
little
laugh
it
is
more
serious
still
when
shall
you
go
as
soon
as
and
why
why
should
i
stay
because
we
all
admire
you
that
is
not
a
reason
i
am
admired
also
in
and
she
began
to
walk
homeward
again
what
could
i
say
to
keep
you
asked
acton
he
wanted
to
keep
her
and
it
was
a
fact
that
he
had
been
thinking
of
her
for
a
week
he
was
in
love
with
her
now
he
was
conscious
of
that
or
he
thought
he
was
and
the
only
question
with
him
was
whether
he
could
trust
her
what
you
can
say
to
keep
me
she
repeated
as
i
want
very
much
to
go
it
is
not
in
my
interest
to
tell
you
besides
i
can
t
he
went
on
with
her
in
silence
he
was
much
more
affected
by
what
she
had
told
him
than
appeared
ever
since
that
evening
of
his
return
from
newport
her
image
had
had
a
terrible
power
to
trouble
him
what
clifford
wentworth
had
told
him
that
had
affected
him
too
in
an
adverse
sense
but
it
had
not
liberated
him
from
the
discomfort
of
a
charm
of
which
his
intelligence
was
impatient
she
is
not
honest
she
is
not
honest
he
kept
murmuring
to
himself
that
is
what
he
had
been
saying
to
the
summer
sky
ten
minutes
before
unfortunately
he
was
unable
to
say
it
finally
definitively
and
now
that
he
was
near
her
it
seemed
to
matter
wonderfully
little
she
is
a
woman
who
will
lie
he
had
said
to
himself
now
as
he
went
along
he
reminded
himself
of
this
observation
but
it
failed
to
frighten
him
as
it
had
done
before
he
almost
wished
he
could
make
her
lie
and
then
convict
her
of
it
so
that
he
might
see
how
he
should
like
that
he
kept
thinking
of
this
as
he
walked
by
her
side
while
she
moved
forward
with
her
light
graceful
dignity
he
had
sat
with
her
before
he
had
driven
with
her
but
he
had
never
walked
with
her
by
jove
how
il
she
is
he
said
as
he
observed
her
sidewise
when
they
reached
the
cottage
in
the
orchard
she
passed
into
the
gate
without
asking
him
to
follow
but
she
turned
round
as
he
stood
there
to
bid
him
i
asked
you
a
question
the
other
night
which
you
never
answered
he
said
have
you
sent
off
that
document
liberating
yourself
she
hesitated
for
a
single
moment
very
naturally
then
yes
she
said
simply
he
turned
away
he
wondered
whether
that
would
do
for
his
lie
but
he
saw
her
again
that
evening
for
the
baroness
reappeared
at
her
uncle
s
he
had
little
talk
with
her
however
two
gentlemen
had
driven
out
from
boston
in
a
buggy
to
call
upon
wentworth
and
his
daughters
and
madame
münster
was
an
object
of
absorbing
interest
to
both
of
the
visitors
one
of
them
indeed
said
nothing
to
her
he
only
sat
and
watched
with
intense
gravity
and
leaned
forward
solemnly
presenting
his
ear
a
very
large
one
as
if
he
were
deaf
whenever
she
dropped
an
observation
he
had
evidently
been
impressed
with
the
idea
of
her
misfortunes
and
reverses
he
never
smiled
his
companion
adopted
a
lighter
easier
style
sat
as
near
as
possible
to
madame
münster
attempted
to
draw
her
out
and
proposed
every
few
moments
a
new
topic
of
conversation
eugenia
was
less
vividly
responsive
than
usual
and
had
less
to
say
than
from
her
brilliant
reputation
her
interlocutor
expected
upon
the
relative
merits
of
european
and
american
institutions
but
she
was
inaccessible
to
robert
acton
who
roamed
about
the
piazza
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
listening
for
the
grating
sound
of
the
buggy
from
boston
as
it
should
be
brought
round
to
the
but
he
listened
in
vain
and
at
last
he
lost
patience
his
sister
came
to
him
and
begged
him
to
take
her
home
and
he
presently
went
off
with
her
eugenia
observed
him
leaving
the
house
with
lizzie
in
her
present
mood
the
fact
seemed
a
contribution
to
her
irritated
conviction
that
he
had
several
precious
qualities
even
that
little
girl
she
reflected
makes
him
do
what
she
she
had
been
sitting
just
within
one
of
the
long
windows
that
opened
upon
the
piazza
but
very
soon
after
acton
had
gone
away
she
got
up
abruptly
just
when
the
talkative
gentleman
from
boston
was
asking
her
what
she
thought
of
the
moral
tone
of
that
city
on
the
piazza
she
encountered
clifford
wentworth
coming
round
from
the
other
side
of
the
house
she
stopped
him
she
told
him
she
wished
to
speak
to
him
why
didn
t
you
go
home
with
your
cousin
she
asked
clifford
stared
why
robert
has
taken
her
he
said
exactly
so
but
you
don
t
usually
leave
that
to
oh
said
clifford
i
want
to
see
those
fellows
start
off
they
don
t
know
how
to
it
is
not
then
that
you
have
quarreled
with
your
cousin
clifford
reflected
a
moment
and
then
with
a
simplicity
which
had
for
the
baroness
a
singularly
baffling
quality
oh
no
we
have
made
up
he
said
she
looked
at
him
for
some
moments
but
clifford
had
begun
to
be
afraid
of
the
baroness
s
looks
and
he
endeavored
now
to
shift
himself
out
of
their
range
why
do
you
never
come
to
see
me
any
more
she
asked
have
i
displeased
you
displeased
me
well
i
guess
not
said
clifford
with
a
laugh
why
haven
t
you
come
then
well
because
i
am
afraid
of
getting
shut
up
in
that
back
eugenia
kept
looking
at
him
i
should
think
you
would
like
like
it
cried
clifford
i
should
if
i
were
a
young
man
calling
upon
a
charming
a
charming
woman
isn
t
much
use
to
me
when
i
am
shut
up
in
that
back
room
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
of
much
use
to
you
anywhere
said
madame
münster
and
yet
you
know
how
i
have
offered
to
well
observed
clifford
by
way
of
response
there
comes
the
never
mind
the
buggy
do
you
know
i
am
going
away
do
you
mean
now
i
mean
in
a
few
days
i
leave
this
you
are
going
back
to
europe
to
europe
where
you
are
to
come
and
see
oh
yes
i
ll
come
out
there
said
clifford
but
before
that
eugenia
declared
you
must
come
and
see
me
well
i
shall
keep
clear
of
that
back
room
rejoined
her
simple
young
kinsman
the
baroness
was
silent
a
moment
yes
you
must
come
frankly
boldly
that
will
be
very
much
better
i
see
that
i
see
it
said
clifford
and
then
in
an
instant
what
s
the
matter
with
that
buggy
his
practiced
ear
had
apparently
detected
an
unnatural
creak
in
the
wheels
of
the
light
vehicle
which
had
been
brought
to
the
portico
and
he
hurried
away
to
investigate
so
grave
an
anomaly
the
baroness
walked
homeward
alone
in
the
starlight
asking
herself
a
question
was
she
to
have
gained
nothing
was
she
to
have
gained
nothing
gertrude
wentworth
had
held
a
silent
place
in
the
little
circle
gathered
about
the
two
gentlemen
from
boston
she
was
not
interested
in
the
visitors
she
was
watching
madame
münster
as
she
constantly
watched
her
she
knew
that
eugenia
also
was
not
interested
that
she
was
bored
and
gertrude
was
absorbed
in
study
of
the
problem
how
in
spite
of
her
indifference
and
her
absent
attention
she
managed
to
have
such
a
charming
manner
that
was
the
manner
gertrude
would
have
liked
to
have
she
determined
to
cultivate
it
and
she
wished
that
to
give
her
the
charm
she
might
in
future
very
often
be
bored
while
she
was
engaged
in
these
researches
felix
young
was
looking
for
charlotte
to
whom
he
had
something
to
say
for
some
time
now
he
had
had
something
to
say
to
charlotte
and
this
evening
his
sense
of
the
propriety
of
holding
some
special
conversation
with
her
had
reached
the
resolved
itself
into
acute
and
delightful
desire
he
wandered
through
the
empty
rooms
on
the
large
of
the
house
and
found
her
at
last
in
a
small
apartment
denominated
for
reasons
not
immediately
apparent
wentworth
s
office
an
extremely
neat
and
room
with
an
array
of
in
on
one
of
the
walls
a
large
map
of
the
united
states
on
the
other
flanked
on
either
side
by
an
old
steel
engraving
of
one
of
raphael
s
madonnas
and
on
the
third
several
glass
cases
containing
specimens
of
butterflies
and
beetles
charlotte
was
sitting
by
a
lamp
embroidering
a
slipper
felix
did
not
ask
for
whom
the
slipper
was
destined
he
saw
it
was
very
large
he
moved
a
chair
toward
her
and
sat
down
smiling
as
usual
but
at
first
not
speaking
she
watched
him
with
her
needle
poised
and
with
a
certain
shy
fluttered
look
which
she
always
wore
when
he
approached
her
there
was
something
in
felix
s
manner
that
quickened
her
modesty
her
if
absolute
choice
had
been
given
her
she
would
have
preferred
never
to
find
herself
alone
with
him
and
in
fact
though
she
thought
him
a
most
brilliant
distinguished
and
person
she
had
exercised
a
much
larger
amount
of
tremulous
tact
than
he
had
ever
suspected
to
circumvent
the
accident
of
poor
charlotte
could
have
given
no
account
of
the
matter
that
would
not
have
seemed
unjust
both
to
herself
and
to
her
foreign
kinsman
she
could
only
have
said
or
rather
she
would
never
have
said
it
that
she
did
not
like
so
much
gentleman
s
society
at
once
she
was
not
reassured
accordingly
when
he
began
emphasizing
his
words
with
a
kind
of
admiring
radiance
my
dear
cousin
i
am
enchanted
at
finding
you
i
am
very
often
alone
charlotte
observed
then
she
quickly
added
i
don
t
mean
i
am
lonely
so
clever
a
woman
as
you
is
never
lonely
said
felix
you
have
company
in
your
beautiful
and
he
glanced
at
the
big
slipper
i
like
to
work
declared
charlotte
simply
so
do
i
said
her
companion
and
i
like
to
idle
too
but
it
is
not
to
idle
that
i
have
come
in
search
of
you
i
want
to
tell
you
something
very
well
murmured
charlotte
of
course
if
you
must
my
dear
cousin
said
felix
it
s
nothing
that
a
young
lady
may
not
listen
to
at
least
i
suppose
it
isn
t
but
you
shall
judge
i
am
terribly
in
well
felix
began
miss
wentworth
gravely
but
her
very
gravity
appeared
to
check
the
development
of
her
phrase
i
am
in
love
with
your
sister
but
in
love
charlotte
in
love
the
young
man
pursued
charlotte
had
laid
her
work
in
her
lap
her
hands
were
tightly
folded
on
top
of
it
she
was
staring
at
the
carpet
in
short
i
m
in
love
dear
lady
said
felix
now
i
want
you
to
help
to
help
you
asked
charlotte
with
a
tremor
i
don
t
mean
with
gertrude
she
and
i
have
a
perfect
understanding
and
oh
how
well
she
understands
one
i
mean
with
your
father
and
with
the
world
in
general
including
poor
mr
brand
said
charlotte
slowly
but
with
a
simplicity
which
made
it
evident
to
felix
that
the
young
minister
had
not
repeated
to
miss
wentworth
the
talk
that
had
lately
occurred
between
them
ah
now
don
t
say
poor
mr
brand
i
don
t
pity
mr
brand
at
all
but
i
pity
your
father
a
little
and
i
don
t
want
to
displease
him
therefore
you
see
i
want
you
to
plead
for
me
you
don
t
think
me
very
shabby
eh
shabby
exclaimed
charlotte
softly
for
whom
felix
represented
the
most
polished
and
iridescent
qualities
of
mankind
i
don
t
mean
in
my
appearance
rejoined
felix
laughing
for
charlotte
was
looking
at
his
boots
i
mean
in
my
conduct
you
don
t
think
it
s
an
abuse
of
hospitality
to
to
care
for
gertrude
asked
charlotte
to
have
really
expressed
one
s
self
because
i
expressed
myself
charlotte
i
must
tell
you
the
whole
truth
i
have
of
course
i
want
to
marry
her
and
here
is
the
difficulty
i
held
off
as
long
as
i
could
but
she
is
such
a
terribly
fascinating
person
she
s
a
strange
creature
charlotte
i
don
t
believe
you
really
know
charlotte
took
up
her
tapestry
again
and
again
she
laid
it
down
i
know
your
father
has
had
higher
views
felix
continued
and
i
think
you
have
shared
them
you
have
wanted
to
marry
her
to
oh
no
said
charlotte
very
earnestly
mr
brand
has
always
admired
her
but
we
did
not
want
anything
of
that
felix
stared
surely
marriage
was
what
you
yes
but
we
didn
t
wish
to
force
la
bonne
heure
that
s
very
unsafe
you
know
with
these
arranged
marriages
there
is
often
the
deuce
to
oh
felix
said
charlotte
we
didn
t
want
to
i
am
delighted
to
hear
that
because
in
such
cases
even
when
the
woman
is
a
thoroughly
good
creature
she
can
t
help
looking
for
a
compensation
a
charming
fellow
comes
along
and
charlotte
sat
mutely
staring
at
the
floor
and
felix
presently
added
do
go
on
with
your
slipper
i
like
to
see
you
charlotte
took
up
her
variegated
canvas
and
began
to
draw
vague
blue
stitches
in
a
big
round
rose
if
gertrude
is
so
so
strange
she
said
why
do
you
want
to
marry
her
ah
that
s
it
dear
charlotte
i
like
strange
women
i
always
have
liked
them
ask
eugenia
and
gertrude
is
wonderful
she
says
the
most
beautiful
things
charlotte
looked
at
him
almost
for
the
first
time
as
if
her
meaning
required
to
be
severely
pointed
you
have
a
great
influence
over
yes
and
no
said
felix
i
had
at
first
i
think
but
now
it
is
six
of
one
and
of
the
other
it
is
reciprocal
she
affects
me
strongly
for
she
so
strong
i
don
t
believe
you
know
her
it
s
a
beautiful
oh
yes
felix
i
have
always
thought
gertrude
s
nature
well
if
you
think
so
now
cried
the
young
man
wait
and
see
she
s
a
folded
flower
let
me
pluck
her
from
the
parent
tree
and
you
will
see
her
expand
i
m
sure
you
will
enjoy
i
don
t
understand
you
murmured
charlotte
i
well
you
can
understand
this
that
i
beg
you
to
say
a
good
word
for
me
to
your
father
he
regards
me
i
naturally
believe
as
a
very
light
fellow
a
bohemian
an
irregular
character
tell
him
i
am
not
all
this
if
i
ever
was
i
have
forgotten
it
i
am
fond
of
pleasure
yes
but
of
innocent
pleasure
pain
is
all
one
but
in
pleasure
you
know
there
are
tremendous
distinctions
say
to
him
that
gertrude
is
a
folded
flower
and
that
i
am
a
serious
man
charlotte
got
up
from
her
chair
slowly
rolling
up
her
work
we
know
you
are
very
kind
to
everyone
felix
she
said
but
we
are
extremely
sorry
for
of
course
you
are
you
especially
because
added
felix
hastily
you
are
a
woman
but
i
don
t
pity
him
it
ought
to
be
enough
for
any
man
that
you
take
an
interest
in
it
is
not
enough
for
brand
said
charlotte
simply
and
she
stood
there
a
moment
as
if
waiting
conscientiously
for
anything
more
that
felix
might
have
to
say
mr
brand
is
not
so
keen
about
his
marriage
as
he
was
he
presently
said
he
is
afraid
of
your
sister
he
begins
to
think
she
is
charlotte
looked
at
him
now
with
beautiful
appealing
eyes
eyes
into
which
he
saw
the
tears
rising
oh
felix
felix
she
cried
what
have
you
done
to
her
i
think
she
was
asleep
i
have
waked
her
up
but
charlotte
apparently
was
really
crying
she
walked
straight
out
of
the
room
and
felix
standing
there
and
meditating
had
the
apparent
brutality
to
take
satisfaction
in
her
tears
late
that
night
gertrude
silent
and
serious
came
to
him
in
the
garden
it
was
a
kind
of
appointment
gertrude
seemed
to
like
appointments
she
plucked
a
handful
of
heliotrope
and
stuck
it
into
the
front
of
her
dress
but
she
said
nothing
they
walked
together
along
one
of
the
paths
and
felix
looked
at
the
great
square
hospitable
house
massing
itself
vaguely
in
the
starlight
with
all
its
windows
darkened
i
have
a
little
of
a
bad
conscience
he
said
i
oughtn
t
to
meet
you
this
way
till
i
have
got
your
father
s
gertrude
looked
at
him
for
some
time
i
don
t
understand
you
very
often
say
that
he
said
considering
how
little
we
understand
each
other
it
is
a
wonder
how
well
we
get
on
we
have
done
nothing
but
meet
since
you
came
here
but
meet
alone
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
you
we
were
alone
gertrude
went
on
what
is
the
difference
now
is
it
because
it
is
at
night
the
difference
gertrude
said
felix
stopping
in
the
path
the
difference
is
that
i
love
you
more
more
than
before
and
then
they
stood
there
talking
in
the
warm
stillness
and
in
front
of
the
closed
dark
house
i
have
been
talking
to
charlotte
been
trying
to
bespeak
her
interest
with
your
father
she
has
a
kind
of
sublime
perversity
was
ever
a
woman
so
bent
upon
cutting
off
her
own
head
you
are
too
careful
said
gertrude
you
are
too
well
cried
the
young
man
i
didn
t
come
here
to
make
anyone
unhappy
gertrude
looked
round
her
awhile
in
the
odorous
darkness
i
will
do
anything
you
please
she
said
for
instance
asked
felix
smiling
i
will
go
away
i
will
do
anything
you
felix
looked
at
her
in
solemn
admiration
yes
we
will
go
away
he
said
but
we
will
make
peace
gertrude
looked
about
her
again
and
then
she
broke
out
passionately
why
do
they
try
to
make
one
feel
guilty
why
do
they
make
it
so
difficult
why
can
t
they
understand
i
will
make
them
understand
said
felix
he
drew
her
hand
into
his
arm
and
they
wandered
about
in
the
garden
talking
for
an
hour
chapter
xii
felix
allowed
charlotte
time
to
plead
his
cause
and
then
on
the
third
day
he
sought
an
interview
with
his
uncle
it
was
in
the
morning
wentworth
was
in
his
office
and
on
going
in
felix
found
that
charlotte
was
at
that
moment
in
conference
with
her
father
she
had
in
fact
been
constantly
near
him
since
her
interview
with
felix
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
it
was
her
duty
to
repeat
very
literally
her
cousin
s
passionate
plea
she
had
accordingly
followed
wentworth
about
like
a
shadow
in
order
to
find
him
at
hand
when
she
should
have
mustered
sufficient
composure
to
speak
for
poor
charlotte
in
this
matter
naturally
lacked
composure
especially
when
she
meditated
upon
some
of
felix
s
intimations
it
was
not
cheerful
work
at
the
best
to
keep
giving
small
to
the
coffin
in
which
one
had
laid
away
for
burial
the
poor
little
unacknowledged
offspring
of
one
s
own
misbehaving
heart
and
the
occupation
was
not
rendered
more
agreeable
by
the
fact
that
the
ghost
of
one
s
stifled
dream
had
been
summoned
from
the
shades
by
the
strange
bold
words
of
a
talkative
young
foreigner
what
had
felix
meant
by
saying
that
mr
brand
was
not
so
keen
to
herself
her
sister
s
justly
depressed
suitor
had
shown
no
sign
of
faltering
charlotte
trembled
all
over
when
she
allowed
herself
to
believe
for
an
instant
now
and
then
that
privately
mr
brand
might
have
faltered
and
as
it
seemed
to
give
more
force
to
felix
s
words
to
repeat
them
to
her
father
she
was
waiting
until
she
should
have
taught
herself
to
be
very
calm
but
she
had
now
begun
to
tell
wentworth
that
she
was
extremely
anxious
she
was
proceeding
to
develop
this
idea
to
enumerate
the
objects
of
her
anxiety
when
felix
came
in
wentworth
sat
there
with
his
legs
crossed
lifting
his
dry
pure
countenance
from
the
boston
felix
entered
smiling
as
if
he
had
something
particular
to
say
and
his
uncle
looked
at
him
as
if
he
both
expected
and
deprecated
this
event
felix
vividly
expressing
himself
had
come
to
be
a
formidable
figure
to
his
uncle
who
had
not
yet
arrived
at
definite
views
as
to
a
proper
tone
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
as
i
have
said
wentworth
shirked
a
responsibility
he
earnestly
desired
that
it
might
not
be
laid
upon
him
to
determine
how
his
nephew
s
lighter
propositions
should
be
treated
he
lived
under
an
apprehension
that
felix
might
yet
beguile
him
into
assent
to
doubtful
inductions
and
his
conscience
instructed
him
that
the
best
form
of
vigilance
was
the
avoidance
of
discussion
he
hoped
that
the
pleasant
episode
of
his
nephew
s
visit
would
pass
away
without
a
further
lapse
of
consistency
felix
looked
at
charlotte
with
an
air
of
understanding
and
then
at
wentworth
and
then
at
charlotte
again
wentworth
bent
his
refined
eyebrows
upon
his
nephew
and
stroked
down
the
first
page
of
the
i
ought
to
have
brought
a
bouquet
said
felix
laughing
in
france
they
always
we
are
not
in
france
observed
wentworth
gravely
while
charlotte
earnestly
gazed
at
him
no
luckily
we
are
not
in
france
where
i
am
afraid
i
should
have
a
harder
time
of
it
my
dear
charlotte
have
you
rendered
me
that
delightful
service
and
felix
bent
toward
her
as
if
someone
had
been
presenting
him
charlotte
looked
at
him
with
almost
frightened
eyes
and
wentworth
thought
this
might
be
the
beginning
of
a
discussion
what
is
the
bouquet
for
he
inquired
by
way
of
turning
it
off
felix
gazed
at
him
smiling
pour
la
demande
and
then
drawing
up
a
chair
he
seated
himself
hat
in
hand
with
a
kind
of
conscious
solemnity
presently
he
turned
to
charlotte
again
my
good
charlotte
my
admirable
charlotte
he
murmured
you
have
not
played
me
false
you
have
not
sided
against
me
charlotte
got
up
trembling
extremely
though
imperceptibly
you
must
speak
to
my
father
yourself
she
said
i
think
you
are
clever
but
felix
rising
too
begged
her
to
remain
i
can
speak
better
to
an
audience
he
declared
i
hope
it
is
nothing
disagreeable
said
wentworth
it
s
something
delightful
for
me
and
felix
laying
down
his
hat
clasped
his
hands
a
little
between
his
knees
my
dear
uncle
he
said
i
desire
very
earnestly
to
marry
your
daughter
charlotte
sank
slowly
into
her
chair
again
and
wentworth
sat
staring
with
a
light
in
his
face
that
might
have
been
flashed
back
from
an
iceberg
he
stared
and
stared
he
said
nothing
felix
fell
back
with
his
hands
still
clasped
ah
you
don
t
like
it
i
was
afraid
he
blushed
deeply
and
charlotte
noticed
it
remarking
to
herself
that
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
seen
him
blush
she
began
to
blush
herself
and
to
reflect
that
he
might
be
much
in
love
this
is
very
abrupt
said
wentworth
at
last
have
you
never
suspected
it
dear
uncle
felix
inquired
well
that
proves
how
discreet
i
have
been
yes
i
thought
you
wouldn
t
like
it
is
very
serious
felix
said
wentworth
you
think
it
s
an
abuse
of
hospitality
exclaimed
felix
smiling
again
of
hospitality
an
abuse
his
uncle
repeated
very
slowly
that
is
what
felix
said
to
me
said
charlotte
conscientiously
of
course
you
think
so
don
t
defend
yourself
felix
pursued
it
an
abuse
obviously
the
most
i
can
claim
is
that
it
is
perhaps
a
pardonable
one
i
simply
fell
head
over
heels
in
love
one
can
hardly
help
that
though
you
are
gertrude
s
progenitor
i
don
t
believe
you
know
how
attractive
she
is
dear
uncle
she
contains
the
elements
of
a
singularly
i
may
say
a
strangely
charming
woman
she
has
always
been
to
me
an
object
of
extreme
concern
said
wentworth
we
have
always
desired
her
well
here
it
is
felix
declared
i
will
make
her
happy
she
believes
it
too
now
hadn
t
you
noticed
that
i
had
noticed
that
she
was
much
changed
wentworth
declared
in
a
tone
whose
unexpressive
unimpassioned
quality
appeared
to
felix
to
reveal
a
profundity
of
opposition
it
may
be
that
she
is
only
becoming
what
you
call
a
charming
gertrude
at
heart
is
so
earnest
so
true
said
charlotte
very
softly
fastening
her
eyes
upon
her
father
i
delight
to
hear
you
praise
her
cried
felix
she
has
a
very
peculiar
temperament
said
wentworth
eh
even
that
is
praise
felix
rejoined
i
know
i
am
not
the
man
you
might
have
looked
for
i
have
no
position
and
no
fortune
i
can
give
gertrude
no
place
in
the
world
a
place
in
the
world
that
s
what
she
ought
to
have
that
would
bring
her
a
place
to
do
her
duty
remarked
wentworth
ah
how
charmingly
she
does
it
her
duty
felix
exclaimed
with
a
radiant
face
what
an
exquisite
conception
she
has
of
it
but
she
comes
honestly
by
that
dear
wentworth
and
charlotte
both
looked
at
him
as
if
they
were
watching
a
greyhound
doubling
of
course
with
me
she
will
hide
her
light
under
a
bushel
he
continued
i
being
the
bushel
now
i
know
you
like
me
you
have
certainly
proved
it
but
you
think
i
am
frivolous
and
penniless
and
shabby
granted
granted
a
thousand
times
granted
i
have
been
a
loose
fish
a
fiddler
a
painter
an
actor
but
there
is
this
to
be
said
in
the
first
place
i
fancy
you
exaggerate
you
lend
me
qualities
i
haven
t
had
i
have
been
a
bohemian
yes
but
in
bohemia
i
always
passed
for
a
gentleman
i
wish
you
could
see
some
of
my
old
they
would
tell
you
it
was
the
liberty
i
liked
but
not
the
opportunities
my
sins
were
all
peccadilloes
i
always
respected
my
neighbor
s
property
my
neighbor
s
wife
do
you
see
dear
uncle
wentworth
ought
to
have
seen
his
cold
blue
eyes
were
intently
fixed
and
then
est
fini
it
s
all
over
me
i
have
settled
down
to
a
i
find
i
can
earn
my
living
a
very
fair
one
by
going
about
the
world
and
painting
bad
portraits
it
s
not
a
glorious
profession
but
it
is
a
perfectly
respectable
one
you
won
t
deny
that
eh
going
about
the
world
i
say
i
must
not
deny
that
for
that
i
am
afraid
i
shall
always
do
in
quest
of
agreeable
sitters
when
i
say
agreeable
i
mean
susceptible
of
delicate
flattery
and
prompt
of
payment
gertrude
declares
she
is
willing
to
share
my
wanderings
and
help
to
pose
my
models
she
even
thinks
it
will
be
charming
and
that
brings
me
to
my
third
point
gertrude
likes
me
encourage
her
a
little
and
she
will
tell
you
felix
s
tongue
obviously
moved
much
faster
than
the
imagination
of
his
auditors
his
eloquence
like
the
rocking
of
a
boat
in
a
deep
smooth
lake
made
long
eddies
of
silence
and
he
seemed
to
be
pleading
and
chattering
still
with
his
brightly
eager
smile
his
uplifted
eyebrows
his
expressive
mouth
after
he
had
ceased
speaking
and
while
with
his
glance
quickly
turning
from
the
father
to
the
daughter
he
sat
waiting
for
the
effect
of
his
appeal
it
is
not
your
want
of
means
said
wentworth
after
a
period
of
severe
reticence
now
it
s
delightful
of
you
to
say
that
only
don
t
say
it
s
my
want
of
character
because
i
have
a
character
i
assure
you
i
have
a
small
one
a
little
slip
of
a
thing
but
still
something
ought
you
not
to
tell
felix
that
it
is
mr
brand
father
charlotte
asked
with
infinite
mildness
it
is
not
only
brand
wentworth
solemnly
declared
and
he
looked
at
his
knee
for
a
long
time
it
is
difficult
to
explain
he
said
he
wished
evidently
to
be
very
just
it
rests
on
moral
grounds
as
mr
brand
says
it
is
the
question
whether
it
is
the
best
thing
for
what
is
better
what
is
better
dear
uncle
felix
rejoined
urgently
rising
in
his
urgency
and
standing
before
wentworth
his
uncle
had
been
looking
at
his
knee
but
when
felix
moved
he
transferred
his
gaze
to
the
handle
of
the
door
which
faced
him
it
is
usually
a
fairly
good
thing
for
a
girl
to
marry
the
man
she
loves
cried
felix
while
he
spoke
wentworth
saw
the
handle
of
the
door
begin
to
turn
the
door
opened
and
remained
slightly
ajar
until
felix
had
delivered
himself
of
the
cheerful
axiom
just
quoted
then
it
opened
altogether
and
gertrude
stood
there
she
looked
excited
there
was
a
spark
in
her
sweet
dull
eyes
she
came
in
slowly
but
with
an
air
of
resolution
and
closing
the
door
softly
looked
round
at
the
three
persons
present
felix
went
to
her
with
tender
gallantry
holding
out
his
hand
and
charlotte
made
a
place
for
her
on
the
sofa
but
gertrude
put
her
hands
behind
her
and
made
no
motion
to
sit
down
we
are
talking
of
you
said
felix
i
know
it
she
answered
that
s
why
i
and
she
fastened
her
eyes
on
her
father
who
returned
her
gaze
very
fixedly
in
his
own
cold
blue
eyes
there
was
a
kind
of
pleading
reasoning
light
it
is
better
you
should
be
present
said
wentworth
we
are
discussing
your
why
discuss
it
asked
gertrude
leave
it
to
that
is
to
me
cried
felix
i
leave
it
in
the
last
resort
to
a
greater
wisdom
than
ours
said
the
old
man
felix
rubbed
his
forehead
gently
but
the
last
resort
your
father
lacks
confidence
he
said
to
gertrude
haven
t
you
confidence
in
felix
gertrude
was
frowning
there
was
something
about
her
that
her
father
and
charlotte
had
never
seen
charlotte
got
up
and
came
to
her
as
if
to
put
her
arm
round
her
but
suddenly
she
seemed
afraid
to
touch
her
wentworth
however
was
not
afraid
i
have
had
more
confidence
in
felix
than
in
you
he
said
yes
you
have
never
had
confidence
in
me
never
never
i
don
t
know
oh
sister
sister
murmured
charlotte
you
have
always
needed
advice
wentworth
declared
you
have
had
a
difficult
why
do
you
call
it
difficult
it
might
have
been
easy
if
you
had
allowed
it
you
wouldn
t
let
me
be
natural
i
don
t
know
what
you
wanted
to
make
of
me
mr
brand
was
the
charlotte
at
last
took
hold
of
her
sister
she
laid
her
two
hands
upon
gertrude
s
arm
he
cares
so
much
for
you
she
almost
whispered
gertrude
looked
at
her
intently
an
instant
then
kissed
her
no
he
does
not
she
said
i
have
never
seen
you
so
passionate
observed
wentworth
with
an
air
of
indignation
mitigated
by
high
principles
i
am
sorry
if
i
offend
you
said
gertrude
you
offend
me
but
i
don
t
think
you
are
yes
father
she
is
sorry
said
charlotte
i
would
even
go
further
dear
uncle
felix
interposed
i
would
question
whether
she
really
offends
you
how
can
she
offend
you
to
this
wentworth
made
no
immediate
answer
then
in
a
moment
she
has
not
profited
as
we
profited
voilà
felix
exclaimed
gertrude
was
very
pale
she
stood
looking
down
i
have
told
felix
i
would
go
away
with
him
she
presently
said
ah
you
have
said
some
admirable
things
cried
the
young
man
go
away
sister
asked
charlotte
away
away
to
some
strange
that
is
to
frighten
you
said
felix
smiling
at
charlotte
to
what
do
you
call
it
asked
gertrude
turning
an
instant
to
felix
to
do
you
propose
to
dispense
with
preliminaries
asked
wentworth
getting
up
dear
uncle
plaisantez
cried
felix
it
seems
to
me
that
these
are
gertrude
turned
to
her
father
i
profited
she
said
you
wanted
to
form
my
character
well
my
character
is
formed
for
my
age
i
know
what
i
want
i
have
chosen
i
am
determined
to
marry
this
you
had
better
consent
sir
said
felix
very
gently
yes
sir
you
had
better
consent
added
a
very
different
voice
charlotte
gave
a
little
jump
and
the
others
turned
to
the
direction
from
which
it
had
come
it
was
the
voice
of
mr
brand
who
had
stepped
through
the
long
window
which
stood
open
to
the
piazza
he
stood
patting
his
forehead
with
his
he
was
very
much
flushed
his
face
wore
a
singular
expression
yes
sir
you
had
better
consent
mr
brand
repeated
coming
forward
i
know
what
miss
gertrude
my
dear
friend
murmured
felix
laying
his
hand
caressingly
on
the
young
minister
s
arm
mr
brand
looked
at
him
then
at
wentworth
lastly
at
gertrude
he
did
not
look
at
charlotte
but
charlotte
s
earnest
eyes
were
fastened
to
his
own
countenance
they
were
asking
an
immense
question
of
it
the
answer
to
this
question
could
not
come
all
at
once
but
some
of
the
elements
of
it
were
there
it
was
one
of
the
elements
of
it
that
mr
brand
was
very
red
that
he
held
his
head
very
high
that
he
had
a
bright
excited
eye
and
an
air
of
embarrassed
boldness
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
taken
a
resolve
in
the
execution
of
which
he
apprehends
the
failure
not
of
his
moral
but
of
his
personal
resources
charlotte
thought
he
looked
very
grand
and
it
is
incontestable
that
mr
brand
felt
very
grand
this
in
fact
was
the
grandest
moment
of
his
life
and
it
was
natural
that
such
a
moment
should
contain
opportunities
of
awkwardness
for
a
large
stout
modest
young
man
come
in
sir
said
wentworth
with
an
angular
wave
of
his
hand
it
is
very
proper
that
you
should
be
i
know
what
you
are
talking
about
mr
brand
rejoined
i
heard
what
your
nephew
and
he
heard
what
you
said
exclaimed
felix
patting
him
again
on
the
arm
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understood
said
wentworth
who
had
angularity
in
his
voice
as
well
as
in
his
gestures
gertrude
had
been
looking
hard
at
her
former
suitor
she
had
been
puzzled
like
her
sister
but
her
imagination
moved
more
quickly
than
charlotte
s
mr
brand
asked
you
to
let
felix
take
me
away
she
said
to
her
father
the
young
minister
gave
her
a
strange
look
it
is
not
because
i
don
t
want
to
see
you
any
more
he
declared
in
a
tone
intended
as
it
were
for
publicity
i
shouldn
t
think
you
would
want
to
see
me
any
more
gertrude
answered
gently
wentworth
stood
staring
isn
t
this
rather
a
change
sir
he
inquired
yes
and
mr
brand
looked
anywhere
only
still
not
at
charlotte
yes
sir
he
repeated
and
he
held
his
handkerchief
a
few
moments
to
his
lips
where
are
our
moral
grounds
demanded
wentworth
who
had
always
thought
mr
brand
would
be
just
the
thing
for
a
younger
daughter
with
a
peculiar
temperament
it
is
sometimes
very
moral
to
change
you
know
suggested
felix
charlotte
had
softly
left
her
sister
s
side
she
had
edged
gently
toward
her
father
and
now
her
hand
found
its
way
into
his
arm
wentworth
had
folded
up
the
into
a
surprisingly
small
compass
and
holding
the
roll
with
one
hand
he
earnestly
clasped
it
with
the
other
mr
brand
was
looking
at
him
and
yet
though
charlotte
was
so
near
his
eyes
failed
to
meet
her
own
gertrude
watched
her
sister
it
is
better
not
to
speak
of
change
said
mr
brand
in
one
sense
there
is
no
change
there
was
something
i
desired
something
i
asked
of
you
i
desire
something
still
i
ask
it
of
and
he
paused
a
moment
wentworth
looked
bewildered
i
should
like
in
my
ministerial
capacity
to
unite
this
young
gertrude
watching
her
sister
saw
charlotte
flushing
intensely
and
wentworth
felt
her
pressing
upon
his
arm
heavenly
powers
murmured
wentworth
and
it
was
the
nearest
approach
to
profanity
he
had
ever
made
that
is
very
nice
that
is
very
handsome
felix
exclaimed
i
don
t
understand
said
wentworth
though
it
was
plain
that
everyone
else
did
that
is
very
beautiful
brand
said
gertrude
emulating
felix
i
should
like
to
marry
you
it
will
give
me
great
as
gertrude
says
it
s
a
beautiful
idea
said
felix
felix
was
smiling
but
mr
brand
was
not
even
trying
to
he
himself
treated
his
proposition
very
seriously
i
have
thought
of
it
and
i
should
like
to
do
it
he
affirmed
charlotte
meanwhile
was
staring
with
expanded
eyes
her
imagination
as
i
have
said
was
not
so
rapid
as
her
sister
s
but
now
it
had
taken
several
little
jumps
father
she
murmured
consent
mr
brand
heard
her
he
looked
away
wentworth
evidently
had
no
imagination
at
all
i
have
always
thought
he
began
slowly
that
gertrude
s
character
required
a
special
line
of
father
repeated
charlotte
then
at
last
mr
brand
looked
at
her
her
father
felt
her
leaning
more
heavily
upon
his
folded
arm
than
she
had
ever
done
before
and
this
with
a
certain
sweet
faintness
in
her
voice
made
him
wonder
what
was
the
matter
he
looked
down
at
her
and
saw
the
encounter
of
her
gaze
with
the
young
theologian
s
but
even
this
told
him
nothing
and
he
continued
to
be
bewildered
nevertheless
i
consent
he
said
at
last
since
mr
brand
recommends
i
should
like
to
perform
the
ceremony
very
soon
observed
mr
brand
with
a
sort
of
solemn
simplicity
come
come
that
s
charming
cried
felix
profanely
wentworth
sank
into
his
chair
doubtless
when
you
understand
it
he
said
with
a
certain
judicial
asperity
gertrude
went
to
her
sister
and
led
her
away
and
felix
having
passed
his
arm
into
brand
s
and
stepped
out
of
the
long
window
with
him
the
old
man
was
left
sitting
there
in
unillumined
perplexity
felix
did
no
work
that
day
in
the
afternoon
with
gertrude
he
got
into
one
of
the
boats
and
floated
about
with
oars
they
talked
a
good
deal
of
mr
brand
though
not
exclusively
that
was
a
fine
stroke
said
felix
it
was
really
gertrude
sat
musing
with
her
eyes
upon
the
ripples
that
was
what
he
wanted
to
be
he
wanted
to
do
something
he
won
t
be
comfortable
till
he
has
married
us
said
felix
so
much
the
he
wanted
to
be
magnanimous
he
wanted
to
have
a
fine
moral
pleasure
i
know
him
so
well
gertrude
went
on
felix
looked
at
her
she
spoke
slowly
gazing
at
the
clear
water
he
thought
of
it
a
great
deal
night
and
day
he
thought
it
would
be
beautiful
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
his
duty
his
duty
to
do
just
that
nothing
less
than
that
he
felt
exalted
he
felt
sublime
that
s
how
he
likes
to
feel
it
is
better
for
him
than
if
i
had
listened
to
it
s
better
for
me
smiled
felix
but
do
you
know
as
regards
the
sacrifice
that
i
don
t
believe
he
admired
you
when
this
decision
was
taken
quite
so
much
as
he
had
done
a
fortnight
before
he
never
admired
me
he
admires
charlotte
he
pitied
me
i
know
him
so
well
then
he
didn
t
pity
you
so
gertrude
looked
at
felix
a
little
smiling
you
shouldn
t
permit
yourself
she
said
to
diminish
the
splendor
of
his
action
he
admires
charlotte
she
repeated
that
s
capital
said
felix
laughingly
and
dipping
his
oars
i
can
not
say
exactly
to
which
member
of
gertrude
s
phrase
he
alluded
but
he
dipped
his
oars
again
and
they
kept
floating
about
neither
felix
nor
his
sister
on
that
day
was
present
at
wentworth
s
at
the
evening
repast
the
two
occupants
of
the
chalet
dined
together
and
the
young
man
informed
his
companion
that
his
marriage
was
now
an
assured
fact
eugenia
congratulated
him
and
replied
that
if
he
were
as
reasonable
a
husband
as
he
had
been
on
the
whole
a
brother
his
wife
would
have
nothing
to
complain
of
felix
looked
at
her
a
moment
smiling
i
hope
he
said
not
to
be
thrown
back
on
my
it
is
very
true
eugenia
rejoined
that
one
s
reason
is
dismally
flat
it
s
a
bed
with
the
mattress
but
the
brother
and
sister
later
in
the
evening
crossed
over
to
the
larger
house
the
baroness
desiring
to
compliment
her
prospective
they
found
the
usual
circle
upon
the
piazza
with
the
exception
of
clifford
wentworth
and
lizzie
acton
and
as
everyone
stood
up
as
usual
to
welcome
the
baroness
eugenia
had
an
admiring
audience
for
her
compliment
to
gertrude
robert
acton
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
piazza
leaning
against
one
of
the
white
columns
so
that
he
found
himself
next
to
eugenia
while
she
acquitted
herself
of
a
neat
little
discourse
of
congratulation
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
know
you
better
she
said
i
have
seen
so
much
less
of
you
than
i
should
have
liked
naturally
now
i
see
the
reason
why
you
will
love
me
a
little
won
t
you
i
think
i
may
say
i
gain
on
being
and
terminating
these
observations
with
the
softest
cadence
of
her
voice
the
baroness
imprinted
a
sort
of
grand
official
kiss
upon
gertrude
s
forehead
increased
familiarity
had
not
to
gertrude
s
imagination
diminished
the
mysterious
impressiveness
of
eugenia
s
personality
and
she
felt
flattered
and
transported
by
this
little
ceremony
robert
acton
also
seemed
to
admire
it
as
he
admired
so
many
of
the
gracious
manifestations
of
madame
münster
s
wit
they
had
the
privilege
of
making
him
restless
and
on
this
occasion
he
walked
away
suddenly
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
then
came
back
and
leaned
against
his
column
eugenia
was
now
complimenting
her
uncle
upon
his
daughter
s
engagement
and
wentworth
was
listening
with
his
usual
plain
yet
refined
politeness
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
by
this
time
his
perception
of
the
mutual
relations
of
the
young
people
who
surrounded
him
had
become
more
acute
but
he
still
took
the
matter
very
seriously
and
he
was
not
at
all
exhilarated
felix
will
make
her
a
good
husband
said
eugenia
he
will
be
a
charming
companion
he
has
a
great
quality
indestructible
you
think
that
s
a
great
quality
asked
the
old
man
eugenia
meditated
with
her
eyes
upon
his
you
think
one
gets
tired
of
it
eh
i
don
t
know
that
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
said
wentworth
well
we
will
say
then
that
it
is
tiresome
for
others
but
delightful
for
one
s
self
a
woman
s
husband
you
know
is
supposed
to
be
her
second
self
so
that
for
felix
and
gertrude
gaiety
will
be
a
common
gertrude
was
always
very
gay
said
wentworth
he
was
trying
to
follow
this
argument
robert
acton
took
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
and
came
a
little
nearer
to
the
baroness
you
say
you
gain
by
being
known
he
said
one
certainly
gains
by
knowing
what
have
gained
asked
eugenia
an
immense
amount
of
that
s
a
questionable
advantage
for
a
man
who
was
already
so
wise
acton
shook
his
head
no
i
was
a
great
fool
before
i
knew
you
and
being
a
fool
you
made
my
acquaintance
you
are
very
let
me
keep
it
up
said
acton
laughing
i
hope
for
our
pleasure
that
your
brother
s
marriage
will
detain
why
should
i
stop
for
my
brother
s
marriage
when
i
would
not
stop
for
my
own
asked
the
baroness
why
shouldn
t
you
stop
in
either
case
now
that
as
you
say
you
have
dissolved
that
mechanical
tie
that
bound
you
to
europe
the
baroness
looked
at
him
a
moment
as
i
say
you
look
as
if
you
doubted
ah
said
acton
returning
her
glance
that
is
a
remnant
of
my
old
folly
we
have
other
attractions
he
added
we
are
to
have
another
but
she
seemed
not
to
hear
him
she
was
looking
at
him
still
my
word
was
never
doubted
before
she
said
we
are
to
have
another
marriage
acton
repeated
smiling
then
she
appeared
to
understand
another
marriage
and
she
looked
at
the
others
felix
was
chattering
to
gertrude
charlotte
at
a
distance
was
watching
them
and
mr
brand
in
quite
another
quarter
was
turning
his
back
to
them
and
with
his
hands
under
his
and
his
large
head
on
one
side
was
looking
at
the
small
tender
crescent
of
a
young
moon
it
ought
to
be
mr
brand
and
charlotte
said
eugenia
but
it
doesn
t
look
like
there
acton
answered
you
must
judge
just
now
by
contraries
there
is
more
than
there
looks
to
be
i
expect
that
combination
one
of
these
days
but
that
is
not
what
i
well
said
the
baroness
i
never
guess
my
own
lovers
so
i
can
t
guess
other
people
acton
gave
a
loud
laugh
and
he
was
about
to
add
a
rejoinder
when
wentworth
approached
his
niece
you
will
be
interested
to
hear
the
old
man
said
with
a
momentary
aspiration
toward
jocosity
of
another
matrimonial
venture
in
our
little
i
was
just
telling
the
baroness
acton
observed
mr
acton
was
apparently
about
to
announce
his
own
engagement
said
eugenia
wentworth
s
jocosity
increased
it
is
not
exactly
that
but
it
is
in
the
family
clifford
hearing
this
morning
that
mr
brand
had
expressed
a
desire
to
tie
the
nuptial
knot
for
his
sister
took
it
into
his
head
to
arrange
that
while
his
hand
was
in
our
good
friend
should
perform
a
like
ceremony
for
himself
and
lizzie
the
baroness
threw
back
her
head
and
smiled
at
her
uncle
then
turning
with
an
intenser
radiance
to
robert
acton
i
am
certainly
very
stupid
not
to
have
thought
of
that
she
said
acton
looked
down
at
his
boots
as
if
he
thought
he
had
perhaps
reached
the
limits
of
legitimate
experimentation
and
for
a
moment
eugenia
said
nothing
more
it
had
been
in
fact
a
sharp
knock
and
she
needed
to
recover
herself
this
was
done
however
promptly
enough
where
are
the
young
people
she
asked
they
are
spending
the
evening
with
my
is
not
the
thing
very
sudden
acton
looked
up
extremely
sudden
there
had
been
a
tacit
understanding
but
within
a
day
or
two
clifford
appears
to
have
received
some
mysterious
impulse
to
precipitate
the
the
impulse
said
the
baroness
was
the
charms
of
your
very
pretty
but
my
sister
s
charms
were
an
old
story
he
had
always
known
acton
had
begun
to
experiment
again
here
however
it
was
evident
the
baroness
would
not
help
him
ah
one
can
t
say
clifford
is
very
young
but
he
is
a
nice
he
s
a
likeable
sort
of
boy
and
he
will
be
a
rich
this
was
acton
s
last
experiment
madame
münster
turned
away
she
made
but
a
short
visit
and
felix
took
her
home
in
her
little
she
went
almost
straight
to
the
mirror
over
the
and
with
a
candle
uplifted
stood
looking
into
it
i
shall
not
wait
for
your
marriage
she
said
to
her
brother
tomorrow
my
maid
shall
pack
my
dear
sister
felix
exclaimed
we
are
to
be
married
immediately
mr
brand
is
too
but
eugenia
turning
and
still
holding
her
candle
aloft
only
looked
about
the
little
at
her
gimcracks
and
curtains
and
cushions
my
maid
shall
pack
up
she
repeated
what
rubbish
i
feel
like
a
strolling
actress
these
are
my
is
the
play
over
eugenia
asked
felix
she
gave
him
a
sharp
glance
i
have
spoken
my
with
great
applause
said
her
brother
oh
applause
applause
she
murmured
and
she
gathered
up
two
or
three
of
her
dispersed
draperies
she
glanced
at
the
beautiful
brocade
and
then
i
don
t
see
how
i
can
have
endured
it
she
said
endure
it
a
little
longer
come
to
my
thank
you
that
s
your
affair
my
affairs
are
where
are
you
going
to
germany
by
the
first
you
have
decided
not
to
marry
acton
i
have
refused
him
said
eugenia
her
brother
looked
at
her
in
silence
i
am
sorry
he
rejoined
at
last
but
i
was
very
discreet
as
you
asked
me
to
be
i
said
please
continue
then
not
to
allude
to
the
matter
said
eugenia
felix
inclined
himself
gravely
you
shall
be
obeyed
but
your
position
in
germany
he
pursued
please
to
make
no
observations
upon
i
was
only
going
to
say
that
i
supposed
it
was
you
are
but
i
thought
you
had
signed
i
have
not
signed
said
the
baroness
felix
urged
her
no
further
and
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
immediately
assist
her
to
embark
mr
brand
was
indeed
it
appeared
very
impatient
to
consummate
his
sacrifice
and
deliver
the
nuptial
benediction
which
would
set
it
off
so
handsomely
but
eugenia
s
impatience
to
withdraw
from
a
country
in
which
she
had
not
found
the
fortune
she
had
come
to
seek
was
even
less
to
be
mistaken
it
is
true
she
had
not
made
any
very
various
exertion
but
she
appeared
to
feel
justified
in
generalizing
in
deciding
that
the
conditions
of
action
on
this
provincial
continent
were
not
favorable
to
really
superior
women
the
elder
world
was
after
all
their
natural
field
the
unembarrassed
directness
with
which
she
proceeded
to
apply
these
intelligent
conclusions
appeared
to
the
little
circle
of
spectators
who
have
figured
in
our
narrative
but
the
supreme
exhibition
of
a
character
to
which
the
experience
of
life
had
imparted
an
inimitable
pliancy
it
had
a
distinct
effect
upon
robert
acton
who
for
the
two
days
preceding
her
departure
was
a
very
restless
and
irritated
mortal
she
passed
her
last
evening
at
her
uncle
s
where
she
had
never
been
more
charming
and
in
parting
with
clifford
wentworth
s
affianced
bride
she
drew
from
her
own
finger
a
curious
old
ring
and
presented
it
to
her
with
the
prettiest
speech
and
kiss
gertrude
who
as
an
affianced
bride
was
also
indebted
to
her
gracious
bounty
admired
this
little
incident
extremely
and
robert
acton
almost
wondered
whether
it
did
not
give
him
the
right
as
lizzie
s
brother
and
guardian
to
offer
in
return
a
handsome
present
to
the
baroness
it
would
have
made
him
extremely
happy
to
be
able
to
offer
a
handsome
present
to
the
baroness
but
he
abstained
from
this
expression
of
his
sentiments
and
they
were
in
consequence
at
the
very
last
by
so
much
the
less
comfortable
it
was
almost
at
the
very
last
that
he
saw
her
late
the
night
before
she
went
to
boston
to
embark
for
myself
i
wish
you
might
have
stayed
he
said
but
not
for
your
own
i
don
t
make
so
many
differences
said
the
baroness
i
am
simply
sorry
to
be
that
s
a
much
deeper
difference
than
mine
acton
declared
for
you
mean
you
are
simply
glad
felix
parted
with
her
on
the
deck
of
the
ship
we
shall
often
meet
over
there
he
said
i
don
t
know
she
answered
europe
seems
to
me
much
larger
than
mr
brand
of
course
in
the
days
that
immediately
followed
was
not
the
only
impatient
spirit
but
it
may
be
said
that
of
all
the
young
spirits
interested
in
the
event
none
rose
more
eagerly
to
the
level
of
the
occasion
gertrude
left
her
father
s
house
with
felix
young
they
were
imperturbably
happy
and
they
went
far
away
clifford
and
his
young
wife
sought
their
felicity
in
a
narrower
circle
and
the
latter
s
influence
upon
her
husband
was
such
as
to
justify
strikingly
that
theory
of
the
elevating
effect
of
easy
intercourse
with
clever
women
which
felix
had
propounded
to
wentworth
gertrude
was
for
a
good
while
a
distant
figure
but
she
came
back
when
charlotte
married
mr
brand
she
was
present
at
the
wedding
feast
where
felix
s
gaiety
confessed
to
no
change
then
she
disappeared
and
the
echo
of
a
gaiety
of
her
own
mingled
with
that
of
her
husband
often
came
back
to
the
home
of
her
earlier
years
wentworth
at
last
found
himself
listening
for
it
and
robert
acton
after
his
mother
s
death
married
a
particularly
nice
young
girl
the
end
