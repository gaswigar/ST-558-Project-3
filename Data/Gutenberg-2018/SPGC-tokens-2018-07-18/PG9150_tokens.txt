advanced
to
meet
weldon
and
her
party
negoro
dick
and
little
jack
negoro
had
approached
without
being
noticed
by
any
one
the
dog
began
to
swim
slowly
and
with
manifest
weakness
towards
the
boat
weldon
assisted
by
nan
and
the
ever
active
dick
sands
was
doing
everything
in
her
power
to
restore
consciousness
to
the
poor
sufferers
the
negroes
were
ever
ready
to
lend
a
helping
hand
there
you
are
then
master
jack
jack
cried
out
in
the
greatest
excitement
that
dingo
knew
how
to
read
negoro
with
a
threatening
gesture
that
seemed
half
involuntary
withdrew
immediately
to
his
accustomed
quarters
this
dingo
is
nothing
out
of
the
way
occasionally
dick
sands
would
take
a
pistol
and
now
and
then
a
rifle
what
a
big
fellow
the
captain
voice
came
from
the
retreating
boat
i
must
get
you
to
keep
your
eye
upon
that
man
the
whale
seemed
utterly
unconscious
of
the
attack
that
was
threatening
it
the
boat
was
full
of
water
and
in
imminent
danger
of
being
capsized
there
is
no
hope
oh
we
shall
soon
be
on
shore
oh
yes
jack
you
shall
keep
the
wind
in
order
all
three
of
them
fell
flat
upon
the
deck
jack
evidenced
his
satisfaction
by
giving
his
huge
friend
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
a
light
shadow
glided
stealthily
along
the
deck
for
half
an
hour
negoro
stood
motionless
under
bare
poles
quick
as
lightning
dick
sands
drew
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
there
look
there
you
have
acquitted
yourself
like
a
man
they
both
examined
the
outspread
chart
the
sea
was
furious
and
dashed
vehemently
upon
the
crags
on
either
hand
surveying
the
shore
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
trying
to
recall
some
past
experience
not
without
emotion
could
weldon
or
indeed
any
of
them
behold
the
unfortunate
ship
the
entomologist
was
seen
making
his
way
down
the
face
of
the
cliff
at
the
imminent
lisk
of
breaking
his
neck
good
morning
my
young
friend
he
is
my
little
son
they
came
to
a
tree
to
which
a
horse
was
tethered
the
way
across
the
forest
could
scarcely
be
called
a
path
occasionally
the
soil
became
marshy
a
halt
for
the
night
hercules
himself
was
the
first
to
keep
watch
do
fire
a
herd
of
gazelles
dashed
past
him
like
a
glowing
cloud
a
halt
was
made
for
the
night
beneath
a
grove
of
lofty
trees

was
gone

were
seated

starting
to
their
feet
looked
anxiously
around

dingo
disappeared

amongst
the
bushes

harris
has
left
us
the
march
was
continued
with
as
much
rapidity
as
was
consistent
with
caution
it
was
a
scene
only
too
common
in
central
africa
another
brilliant
flash
brought
the
camp
once
again
into
relief
one
after
another
the
whole
party
made
their

cousin

curiosity
was
awakened
the
naturalist
now
fairly
mounted
on
a
favourite
hobby
my
poor
boy
i

set
to

of

poor
old

been

on
the

by
a
dozen
or
more

abandoned

with
a
yell
and

the

dead
at

taken
fire
internally
your

all
his
energies
were
restored
friendless
and
hopeless
he
contented
himself
with
the
permission
to
go
where
he
pleased
within
the
limits
of
the
palisade

will
not
mind
coming

you

with
none
to

the
insufferable
heat
had
driven
all
the
residents
within

indoors
before
long
the
old
black
speck
was
again
flitting
just
above
his
head
for
that
day
at

cousin
benedict
had
lost
his
chance
of
being
the
happiest
of
entomologists
the
entire
crowd
joined

they

both
of

hercules
could
leave
the
boat
without
much
fear
of
detection
it
was
caused
by

more
elephants
he
stood

instantly
five

six

chapter
i
the
pilgrim
on
the
of
february
the
pilgrim
a
tight
little
craft
of
tons
burden
lay
in
lat
and
long
she
was
a
schooner
the
property
of
james
weldon
a
wealthy
californian
who
had
fitted
her
out
at
san
francisco
expressly
for
the
in
the
southern
seas
james
weldon
was
accustomed
every
season
to
send
his
whalers
both
to
the
arctic
regions
beyond
behring
straits
and
to
the
antarctic
ocean
below
tasmania
and
cape
horn
and
the
pilgrim
although
one
of
the
smallest
was
one
of
the
vessels
of
its
class
her
were
splendid
and
her
rigging
was
so
adroitly
adapted
that
with
a
very
small
crew
she
might
venture
without
risk
within
sight
of
the
impenetrable
of
the
southern
hemisphere
under
skilful
guidance
she
could
dauntlessly
thread
her
way
amongst
the
drifting
that
lessened
though
they
were
by
perpetual
shocks
and
undermined
by
warm
currents
made
their
way
northwards
as
far
as
the
parallel
of
new
zealand
or
the
cape
of
good
hope
to
a
latitude
corresponding
to
which
in
the
northern
hemisphere
they
are
never
seen
having
already
melted
away
in
the
depths
of
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
for
several
years
the
command
of
the
pilgrim
had
been
entrusted
to
captain
hull
an
experienced
seaman
and
one
of
the
most
dexterous
harpooners
in
weldon
service
the
crew
consisted
of
five
sailors
and
an
apprentice
this
number
of
course
was
quite
insufficient
for
the
process
of
which
requires
a
large
contingent
both
for
manning
the
and
for
cutting
up
the
whales
after
they
are
captured
but
weldon
following
the
example
of
other
owners
found
it
more
economical
to
embark
at
san
francisco
only
just
enough
men
to
work
the
ship
to
new
zealand
where
from
the
promiscuous
gathering
of
seamen
of
every
nationality
and
of
needy
emigrants
the
captain
had
no
difficulty
in
engaging
as
many
whalemen
as
he
wanted
for
the
season
this
method
of
hiring
men
who
could
be
at
once
discharged
when
their
services
were
no
longer
required
had
proved
altogether
to
be
the
most
profitable
and
convenient
the
pilgrim
had
now
just
completed
her
annual
voyage
to
the
antarctic
circle
it
was
not
however
with
her
proper
quota
of
full
to
the
brim
nor
yet
with
an
ample
cargo
of
cut
and
uncut
whalebone
that
she
was
thus
far
on
her
way
back
the
time
indeed
for
a
good
haul
was
past
the
repeated
and
vigourous
attacks
upon
the
cetaceans
had
made
them
very
scarce
the
whale
known
as
the
right
whale
the
of
the
northern
fisheries
the
of
the
southern
was
hardly
ever
to
be
seen
and
latterly
the
whalers
had
had
no
alternative
but
to
direct
their
efforts
against
the
finback
or
jubarte
a
gigantic
mammal
encounter
with
which
is
always
attended
with
considerable
danger
so
scanty
this
year
had
been
the
supply
of
whales
that
captain
hull
had
resolved
next
year
to
push
his
way
into
far
more
southern
latitudes
even
if
necessary
to
advance
to
the
regions
known
as
clarie
and
adélie
lands
of
which
the
discovery
though
claimed
by
the
american
navigator
wilkes
belongs
by
right
to
the
illustrious
frenchman
dumont
the
commander
of
the
astrolabe
and
the
zélee
the
season
had
been
exceptionally
unfortunate
for
the
pilgrim
at
the
beginning
of
january
almost
in
the
height
of
the
southern
summer
long
before
the
ordinary
time
for
the
whalers
return
captain
hull
had
been
obliged
to
abandon
his
his
hired
contingent
all
men
of
more
than
doubtful
character
had
given
signs
of
such
insubordination
as
threatened
to
end
in
mutiny
and
he
had
become
aware
that
he
must
part
company
with
them
on
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
accordingly
without
delay
the
bow
of
the
pilgrim
was
directed
to
the
northwest
towards
new
zealand
which
was
sighted
on
the
of
january
and
on
reaching
waitemata
the
port
of
auckland
in
the
hauraki
gulf
on
the
east
coast
of
north
island
the
whole
of
the
gang
was
peremptorily
discharged
the
ship
crew
were
more
than
dissatisfied
they
were
angry
never
before
had
they
returned
with
so
meagre
a
haul
they
ought
to
have
had
at
least
two
hundred
barrels
more
the
captain
himself
experienced
all
the
mortification
of
an
ardent
sportsman
who
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
brings
home
a
bag
and
there
was
a
general
spirit
of
animosity
against
the
rascals
whose
rebellion
had
so
entirely
marred
the
success
of
the
expedition
captain
hull
did
everything
in
his
power
to
repair
the
disappointment
he
made
every
effort
to
engage
a
fresh
gang
but
it
was
too
late
every
available
seaman
had
long
since
been
carried
off
to
the
fisheries
finding
therefore
that
all
hope
of
making
good
the
deficiency
in
his
cargo
must
be
resigned
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
auckland
alone
with
his
crew
when
he
was
met
by
a
request
with
which
he
felt
himself
bound
to
comply
it
had
chanced
that
james
weldon
on
one
of
those
journeys
which
were
necessitated
by
the
nature
of
his
business
had
brought
with
him
his
wife
his
son
jack
a
child
of
five
years
of
age
and
a
relation
of
the
family
who
was
generally
known
by
the
name
of
cousin
benedict
weldon
had
of
course
intended
that
his
family
should
accompany
him
on
his
return
home
to
san
francisco
but
little
jack
was
taken
so
seriously
ill
that
his
father
whose
affairs
demanded
his
immediate
return
was
obliged
to
leave
him
behind
at
auckland
with
his
wife
and
cousin
benedict
three
months
had
passed
away
little
jack
was
convalescent
and
weldon
weary
of
her
long
separation
from
her
husband
was
anxious
to
get
home
as
soon
as
possible
her
readiest
way
of
reaching
san
francisco
was
to
cross
to
australia
and
thence
to
take
a
passage
in
one
of
the
vessels
of
the
golden
age
company
which
run
between
melbourne
and
the
isthmus
of
panama
on
arriving
in
panama
she
would
have
to
wait
the
departure
of
the
next
american
steamer
of
the
line
which
maintains
a
regular
communication
between
the
isthmus
and
california
this
route
however
involved
many
stoppages
and
changes
such
as
are
always
disagreeable
and
inconvenient
for
women
and
children
and
weldon
was
hesitating
whether
she
should
encounter
the
journey
when
she
heard
that
her
husband
vessel
the
pilgrim
had
arrived
at
auckland
hastening
to
captain
hull
she
begged
him
to
take
her
with
her
little
boy
cousin
benedict
and
nan
an
old
negress
who
had
been
her
attendant
from
her
childhood
on
board
the
pilgrim
and
to
convey
them
to
san
francisco
direct
was
it
not
over
hazardous
asked
the
captain
to
venture
upon
a
voyage
of
between
and
miles
in
so
small
a
but
weldon
urged
her
request
and
captain
hull
confident
in
the
qualities
of
his
craft
and
anticipating
at
this
season
nothing
but
fair
weather
on
either
side
of
the
equator
gave
his
consent
in
order
to
provide
as
far
as
possible
for
the
comfort
of
the
lady
during
a
voyage
that
must
occupy
from
forty
to
fifty
days
the
captain
placed
his
own
cabin
at
her
entire
disposal
everything
promised
well
for
a
prosperous
voyage
the
only
hindrance
that
could
be
foreseen
arose
from
the
circumstance
that
the
pilgrim
would
have
to
put
in
at
valparaiso
for
the
purpose
of
unlading
but
that
business
once
accomplished
she
would
continue
her
way
along
the
american
coast
with
the
assistance
of
the
land
breezes
which
ordinarily
make
the
proximity
of
those
shores
such
agreeable
quarters
for
sailing
weldon
herself
had
accompanied
her
husband
in
so
many
voyages
that
she
was
quite
inured
to
all
the
makeshifts
of
a
seafaring
life
and
was
conscious
of
no
misgiving
in
embarking
upon
a
vessel
of
such
small
tonnage
she
was
a
brave
woman
of
about
thirty
years
of
age
in
the
enjoyment
of
excellent
health
and
for
her
the
sea
had
no
terrors
aware
that
captain
hull
was
an
experienced
man
in
whom
her
husband
had
the
utmost
confidence
and
knowing
that
his
ship
was
a
substantial
craft
registered
as
one
of
the
best
of
the
american
whalers
so
far
from
entertaining
any
mistrust
as
to
her
safety
she
only
rejoiced
in
the
opportuneness
of
the
chance
which
seemed
to
offer
her
a
direct
and
unbroken
route
to
her
destination
cousin
benedict
as
a
matter
of
course
was
to
accompany
her
he
was
about
fifty
but
in
spite
of
his
mature
age
it
would
have
been
considered
the
height
of
imprudence
to
allow
him
to
travel
anywhere
alone
spare
lanky
with
a
bony
frame
with
an
enormous
cranium
and
a
profusion
of
hair
he
was
one
of
those
amiable
inoffensive
who
having
once
taken
to
gold
spectacles
appear
to
have
arrived
at
a
settled
standard
of
age
and
however
long
they
live
afterwards
seem
never
to
be
older
than
they
have
ever
been
claiming
a
sort
of
kindredship
with
all
the
world
he
was
universally
known
far
beyond
the
pale
of
his
own
connexions
by
the
name
of
cousin
benedict
in
the
ordinary
concerns
of
life
nothing
would
ever
have
rendered
him
capable
of
shifting
for
himself
of
his
meals
he
would
never
think
until
they
were
placed
before
him
he
had
the
appearance
of
being
utterly
insensible
to
heat
or
cold
he
vegetated
rather
than
lived
and
might
not
inaptly
be
compared
to
a
tree
which
though
healthy
enough
at
its
core
produces
scant
foliage
and
no
fruit
his
long
arms
and
legs
were
in
the
way
of
himself
and
everybody
else
yet
no
one
could
possibly
treat
him
with
unkindness
as
prudhomme
would
say
if
only
he
had
been
endowed
with
capability
he
would
have
rendered
a
service
to
any
one
in
the
world
but
helplessness
was
his
dominant
characteristic
helplessness
was
ingrained
into
his
very
nature
yet
this
very
helplessness
made
him
an
object
of
kind
consideration
rather
than
of
contempt
and
weldon
looked
upon
him
as
a
kind
of
elder
brother
to
her
little
jack
it
must
not
be
supposed
however
that
cousin
benedict
was
either
idle
or
unoccupied
on
the
contrary
his
whole
time
was
devoted
to
one
absorbing
passion
for
natural
history
not
that
he
had
any
large
claim
to
be
regarded
properly
as
a
natural
historian
he
had
made
no
excursions
over
the
whole
four
districts
of
zoology
botany
mineralogy
and
geology
into
which
the
realms
of
natural
history
are
commonly
divided
indeed
he
had
no
pretensions
at
all
to
be
either
a
botanist
a
mineralogist
or
a
geologist
his
studies
only
sufficed
to
make
him
a
zoologist
and
that
in
a
very
limited
sense
no
cuvier
was
he
he
did
not
aspire
to
decompose
animal
life
by
analysis
and
to
recompose
it
by
synthesis
his
enthusiasm
had
not
made
him
at
all
deeply
versed
in
vertebrata
mollusca
or
radiata
in
fact
the
vertebrata
animals
birds
reptiles
fishes
had
had
no
place
in
his
researches
the
mollusca
from
the
cephalopoda
to
the
bryozia
had
had
no
attractions
for
him
nor
had
he
consumed
the
midnight
oil
in
investigating
the
radiata
the
echmodermata
acalephæ
polypi
entozoa
or
infusoria
no
cousin
benedict
interest
began
and
ended
with
the
articulata
and
it
must
be
owned
at
once
that
his
studies
were
very
far
from
embracing
all
the
range
of
the
six
classes
into
which
articulata
are
subdivided
viz
the
insecta
the
mynapoda
the
arachnida
the
crustacea
the
cinhopoda
and
the
anelides
and
he
was
utterly
unable
in
scientific
language
to
distinguish
a
worm
from
a
leech
an
earwig
from
a
a
spider
from
a
scorpion
a
shrimp
from
a
or
a
from
a
centipede
to
confess
the
plain
truth
cousin
benedict
was
an
amateur
entomologist
and
nothing
more
entomology
it
may
be
asserted
is
a
wide
science
it
embraces
the
whole
division
of
the
articulata
but
our
friend
was
an
entomologist
only
in
the
limited
sense
of
the
popular
acceptation
of
the
word
that
is
to
say
he
was
an
observer
and
collector
of
insects
meaning
by
insects
those
articulata
which
have
bodies
consisting
of
a
number
of
concentric
movable
rings
forming
three
distinct
segments
each
with
a
pair
of
legs
and
which
are
scientifically
designated
as
hexapods
illustration
cousin
benedict
to
this
extent
was
cousin
benedict
an
entomologist
and
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
class
of
insecta
of
which
he
had
grown
up
to
be
the
enthusiastic
student
comprises
no
less
than
ten
orders
and
that
of
these
ten
the
coleoptera
and
diptera
alone
include
and
species
respectively
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
had
an
ample
field
for
his
most
persevering
exertions
footnote
these
ten
orders
are
the
orthoptera
grasshoppers
and
crickets
the
neuroptera
the
hymenoptera
bees
wasps
and
ants
the
lepidoptera
butterflies
and
moths
the
hemiptera
cicadas
and
fleas
the
coleoptera
cockchafers
and
the
diptera
gnats
and
flies
the
rhipiptera
the
stylops
the
parasites
the
acarus
and
the
thysanura
the
lepisma
and
podura
every
available
hour
did
he
spend
in
the
pursuit
of
his
favourite
science
hexapods
ruled
his
thoughts
by
day
and
his
dreams
by
night
the
number
of
pins
that
he
carried
thick
on
the
collar
and
sleeves
of
his
coat
down
the
front
of
his
waistcoat
and
on
the
crown
of
his
hat
defied
computation
they
were
kept
in
readiness
for
the
capture
of
specimens
that
might
come
in
his
way
and
on
his
return
from
a
ramble
in
the
country
he
might
be
seen
literally
encased
with
a
covering
of
insects
transfixed
adroitly
by
scientific
rule
this
ruling
passion
of
his
had
been
the
inducement
that
had
urged
him
to
accompany
and
weldon
to
new
zealand
it
had
appeared
to
him
that
it
was
likely
to
be
a
promising
district
and
now
having
been
successful
in
adding
some
rare
specimens
to
his
collection
he
was
anxious
to
get
back
again
to
san
francisco
and
to
assign
them
their
proper
places
in
his
extensive
cabinet
besides
it
never
occurred
to
weldon
to
start
without
him
to
leave
him
to
shift
for
himself
would
be
sheer
cruelty
as
a
matter
of
course
whenever
weldon
went
on
board
the
pilgrim
cousin
benedict
would
go
too
not
that
in
any
emergency
assistance
of
any
kind
could
be
expected
from
him
on
the
contrary
in
the
case
of
difficulty
he
would
be
an
additional
burden
but
there
was
every
reason
to
expect
a
fair
passage
and
no
cause
of
misgiving
of
any
kind
so
the
propriety
of
leaving
the
amiable
entomologist
behind
was
never
suggested
anxious
that
she
should
be
no
impediment
in
the
way
of
the
due
departure
of
the
pilgrim
from
waitemata
weldon
made
her
preparations
with
the
utmost
haste
discharged
the
servants
which
she
had
temporarily
engaged
at
auckland
and
accompanied
by
little
jack
and
the
old
negress
and
followed
mechanically
by
cousin
benedict
embarked
on
the
of
january
on
board
the
schooner
the
amateur
however
kept
his
eye
very
scrupulously
upon
his
own
special
box
amongst
his
collection
of
insects
were
some
very
remarkable
examples
of
new
staphylins
a
species
of
carnivorous
coleoptera
with
eyes
placed
above
their
head
it
was
a
kind
supposed
to
be
peculiar
to
new
caledonia
another
rarity
which
had
been
brought
under
his
notice
was
a
venomous
spider
known
among
the
maoris
as
a
katipo
its
bite
was
asserted
to
be
very
often
fatal
as
a
spider
however
belongs
to
the
order
of
the
arachnida
and
is
not
properly
an
insect
benedict
declined
to
take
any
interest
in
it
enough
for
him
that
he
had
secured
a
novelty
in
his
own
section
of
research
the
staphylin
was
not
only
the
gem
of
his
collection
but
its
pecuniary
value
baffled
ordinary
estimate
he
insured
his
box
at
a
fabulous
sum
deeming
it
to
be
worth
far
more
than
all
the
cargo
of
oil
and
whalebone

the
pilgrim
hold
captain
hull
advanced
to
meet
weldon
and
her
party
as
they
stepped
on
deck
it
must
be
understood
weldon
he
said
courteously
raising
his
hat
that
you
take
this
passage
entirely
on
your
own
responsibility
certainly
captain
hull
she
answered
but
why
do
you
ask
simply
because
i
have
received
no
orders
from
weldon
replied

oh
i

of
your
grumbling
travellers
i
shall
have
no
complaints
to
make
either
of
small
cramped
cabins
or
of
rough
and
meagre
food
she
took
her
son
by
the
hand
and
passing
on
begged
that
they
might
start
forthwith
orders
accordingly
were
given
sails
were
trimmed
and
after
taking
the
shortest
course
across
the
gulf
the
pilgrim
turned
her
head
towards
america
three
days
later
strong
easterly
breezes
compelled
the
schooner
to
tack
to
larboard
in
order
to
get
to
windward
the
consequence
was
that
by
the
of
february
the
captain
found
himself
in
such
a
latitude
that
he
might
almost
be
suspected
of
intending
to
round
cape
horn
rather
than
of
having
a
design
to
coast
the
western
shores
of
the
new
continent
still
the
sea
did
not
become
rough
there
was
a
slight
delay

on
the
whole

was
perfectly
easy

the

there
was
no

upon

so
that
weldon
had
no
alternative
than
to
acquiesce
in
the
captain
proposal
that
she
should
occupy
his
own
modest
cabin
accordingly
here
she
was
installed
with

himself

of
the

brave
and
experienced
seamen
and
united
by
tastes
and
habits
in
a
common
bond
of
sympathy
few
as
they
were
in
number
their
work
was
never
shirked
not
simply
from
the
sense
of
duty
but
because
they
were
directly
interested
in
the
profits
of
their
undertaking
the
success
of
their
labours
always
told
to
their
own
advantage
the
present
expedition
was
the
fourth
that
they
had
taken
together
and
as
it
turned
out
to
be
the
first
in
which
they
had
failed
to
meet
with
success
it
may
be
imagined
that
they
were
full
of
resentment
against
the
mutinous
whalemen
who
had
been
the
cause
of
so
serious
a
diminution
of
their
ordinary
gains

negoro
the
only
one
on
board
who
was
not
an
american
was
a
man
who
had
been
temporarily
engaged
as
cook
his
name
was
negoro
he
was
a
portuguese
by
birth
but
spoke
english
with
perfect
fluency
the
previous
cook
had
deserted
the
ship
at
auckland
and
when
negoro
who
was
out
of
employment
applied
for
the
place
captain
hull
only
too
glad
to
avoid
detention
engaged
him
at
once
without
inquiry
into
his
antecedents
there
was
not
the
slightest
fault
to
be
found
with
the
way
in
which
the
cook
performed
his
duties
but
there
was
something
in
his
manner
or
perhaps
rather
in
the
expression
of
his
countenance
which
excited
the
captain
misgivings
and
made
him
regret
that
he
had
not
taken
more
pains
to
investigate
the
character
of
one
with
whom
he
was
now
brought
into
such
close
contact
negoro
looked
about
forty
years
of
age
although
he
had
the
appearance
of
being
slightly
built
he
was
muscular
he
was
of
middle
height
and
seemed
to
have
a
robust
constitution
his
hair
was
dark
his
complexion
somewhat
swarthy
his
manner
was
taciturn
and
although
from
occasional
remarks
that
he
dropped
it
was
evident
that
he
had
received
some
education
he
was
very
reserved
on
the
subjects
both
of
his
family
and
of
his
past
life
no
one
knew
where
he
had
come
from
and
he
admitted
no
one
to
his
confidence
as
to
where
he
was
going
except
that
he
made
no
secret
of
his
intention
to
land
at
valparaiso
his
freedom
from
demonstrated
that
this
could
hardly
be
his
first
voyage
but
on
the
other
hand
his
complete
ignorance
of
phraseology
made
it
certain
that
he
had
never
been
accustomed
to
his
present
occupation
he
kept
himself
aloof
as
much
as
possible
from
the
rest
of
the
crew
during
the
day
rarely
leaving
the
great
stove
which
was
out
of
proportion
to
the
measurement
of
the
cramped
little
kitchen
and
at
night
as
soon
as
the
fire
was
extinguished
took
the
earliest
opportunity
of
retiring
to
his
berth
and
going
to
sleep
it
has
been
already
stated
that
the
crew
of
the
pilgrim
consisted
of
five
seamen
and
an
apprentice
this
apprentice
was
dick
sands
dick
was
fifteen
years
old
he
was
a
foundling
his
unknown
parents
having
abandoned
him
at
his
birth
and
he
had
been
brought
up
in
a
public
charitable
institution
he
had
been
called
dick
after
the
benevolent
who
had
discovered
him
when
he
was
but
an
infant
a
few
hours
old
and
he
had
received
the
surname
of
sands
as
a
memorial
of
the
spot
where
he
had
been
exposed
sandy
hook
a
point
at
the
mouth
of
the
hudson
where
it
forms
an
entrance
to
the
harbour
of
new
york
as
dick
was
so
young
it
was
most
likely
he
would
yet
grow
a
little
taller
but
it
did
not
seem
probable
that
he
would
ever
exceed
middle
height
he
looked
too
stoutly
and
strongly
built
to
grow
much
his
complexion
was
dark
but
his
beaming
blue
eyes
attested
with
scarcely
room
for
doubt
his
origin
and
his
countenance
betokened
energy
and
intelligence
the
profession
that
he
had
adopted
seemed
to
have
equipped
him
betimes
for
fighting
the
battle
of
life
misquoted
often
as
virgil
are
the
words
audaces
fortuna
juvat
but
the
true
reading
is
audentes
fortuna
juvat
and
slight
as
the
difference
may
seem
it
is
very
significant
it
is
upon
the
confident
rather
than
the
rash
the
daring
rather
than
the
bold
that
fortune
sheds
her
smiles
the
bold
man
often
acts
without
thinking
whilst
the
daring
always
thinks
before
he
acts
and
dick
sands
was
truly
courageous
he
was
one
of
the
daring
at
fifteen
years
old
an
age
at
which
few
boys
have
laid
aside
the
frivolities
of
childhood
he
had
acquired
the
stability
of
a
man
and
the
most
casual
observer
could
scarcely
fail
to
be
attracted
by
his
bright
yet
thoughtful
countenance
at
an
early
period
of
his
life
he
had
realized
all
the
difficulties
of
his
position
and
had
made
a
resolution
from
which
nothing
tempted
him
to
flinch
that
he
would
carve
out
for
himself
an
honourable
and
independent
career
lithe
and
agile
in
his
movements
he
was
an
adept
in
every
kind
of
athletic
exercise
and
so
marvellous
was
his
success
in
everything
he
undertook
that
he
might
almost
be
supposed
to
be
one
of
those
gifted
mortals
who
have
two
right
hands
and
two
left
feet
until
he
was
four
years
old
the
little
orphan
had
found
a
home
in
one
of
those
institutions
in
america
where
forsaken
children
are
sure
of
an
asylum
and
he
was
subsequently
sent
to
an
industrial
school
supported
by
charitable
aid
where
he
learnt
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
from
the
days
of
infancy
he
had
never
deviated
from
the
expression
of
his
wish
to
be
a
sailor
and
accordingly
as
soon
as
he
was
eight
he
was
placed
as
on
board
one
of
the
ships
that
navigate
the
southern
seas
the
officers
all
took
a
peculiar
interest
in
him
and
he
received
in
consequence
a
thoroughly
good
grounding
in
the
duties
and
discipline
of
a
seaman
life
there
was
no
room
to
doubt
that
he
must
ultimately
rise
to
eminence
in
his
profession
for
when
a
child
from
the
very
first
has
been
trained
in
the
knowledge
that
he
must
gain
his
bread
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
it
is
comparatively
rare
that
he
lacks
the
will
to
do
so
whilst
he
was
still
acting
as
on
one
of
those

the
notice
of
captain

took
a
fancy
to
the
lad
and
introduced
him
to
his
employer
weldon
at
once
took
a
lively
interest
in
dick
welfare
and
had
his
education
continued
in
san
francisco
taking
care
that
he
was
instructed
in
the
doctrines
of
the
roman
catholic
church
to
which
his

belonged
throughout
his
studies

favourite
subjects
were
always
those
which
had
a
reference
to
his
future
profession
he
mastered
the
details
of
the
geography
of
the
world
he
applied
himself
diligently
to
such
branches
of
mathematics
as
were
necessary
for
the
science
of
navigation
whilst
for
recreation
in
his
hours
of
leisure
he
would
greedily
devour
every
book
of
adventure
in
travel
that
came
in
his
way
nor
did
he
omit
duly
to
combine
the
practical
with
the
theoretical
and
when
he
was
bound
apprentice
on
board
the
pilgrim
a
vessel
not
only
belonging
to
his
benefactor
but
under
the
command
of
his
kind
friend
captain
hull
he
congratulated
himself
most
heartily
and
felt
that
the
experience
he
should
gain
in
the
southern
could
hardly
fail
to
be
of
service
to
him
in
a
sailor
ought
to
be
a
fisherman
too
it
was
a
matter
of
the
greatest
pleasure
to
dick
sands
when
he
heard
to
his
surprise
that
weldon
was
about
to
become
a
passenger
on
board
the
pilgrim
his
devotion
to
the
family
of
his
benefactor
was
large
and
genuine
for
several
years
weldon
had
acted
towards
him
little
short
of
a
mother
part
and
for
jack
although
he
never
forgot
the
difference
in
their
position
he
entertained
a
affection
his
friends
had
the
satisfaction
of
being
assured
that
they
had
sown
the
seeds
of
kindness
on
a
generous
soil
for
there
was
no
room
to
doubt
that
the
heart
of
the
orphan
boy
was
overflowing
with
sincere
gratitude
should
the
occasion
arise
ought
he
not
he
asked
to
be
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
in
behalf
of
those
to
whom
he
was
indebted
not
only
for
his
start
in
life
but
for
the
knowledge
of
all
that
was
right
and
holy
confiding
in
the
good
principles
of
her
protégé
weldon
had
no
hesitation
in
entrusting
her
little
son
to
his
especial
charge
during
the
frequent
periods
of
leisure
when
the
sea
was
fair
and
the
sails
required
no
shifting
the
apprentice
was
never
weary
of
amusing
jack
by
making
him
familiar
with
the
practice
of
a
sailor
craft
he
made
him
scramble
up
the
shrouds
perch
upon
the
yards
and
slip
down
the
and
the
mother
had
no
alarm
her
assurance
of
dick
ability
and
watchfulness
to
protect
her
boy
was
so
complete
that
she
could
only
rejoice
in
an
occupation
for
him
that
seemed
more
than
anything
to
restore
the
colour
he
had
lost
in
his
recent
illness
time
passed
on
without
incident
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
constant
prevalence
of
an
adverse
wind
neither
passengers
nor
crew
could
have
found
the
least
cause
of
complaint
the
pertinacity
however
with
which
the
wind
kept
to
the
east
could
not
do
otherwise
than
make
captain
hull
somewhat
concerned
it
absolutely
prevented
him
from
getting
his
ship
into
her
proper
course
and
he
could
not
altogether
suppress
his
misgiving
that
the
calms
near
the
tropic
of
capricorn
and
the
equatorial
current
driving
him
on
westwards
would
entail
a
delay
that
might
be
serious
illustration
dick
and
little
jack
it
was
principally
on
weldon
account
that
the
captain
began
to
feel
uneasiness
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
if
he
could
hail
a
vessel
proceeding
to
america
he
should
advise
his
passengers
to
embark
on
her
unfortunately
however
he
felt
that
they
were
still
in
a
latitude
far
too
much
to
the
south
to
make
it
likely
that
they
should
sight
a
steamer
going
to
panama
and
at
that
date
communication
between
australia
and
the
new
world
was
much
less
frequent
than
it
has
since
become
still
nothing
occurred
to
interrupt
the
general
monotony
of
the
voyage
until
the
of
february
the
date
at
which
our
narrative
commences
it
was
about
nine
in
the
morning
of
that
day
that
dick
and
little
jack
had
perched
themselves
together
on
the
the
weather
was
very
clear
and
they
could
see
the
horizon
right
round
except
the
section
behind
them
hidden
by
the
on
the
below
them
the
bowsprit
seemed
to
lie
along
the
water
with
its
attached
like
three
unequal
wings
from

the

the
smooth
surface

their
heads
nothing
but
the

was
running
on
the

as
close
to
the
wind
as
possible
dick
sand
was
pointing
out
to
jack
how
well
the
ship
was
ballasted
and
was
trying
to
explain
how
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
capsize
however
much
she
heeled
to
starboard
when
suddenly
the
little
fellow
cried
out
i
can
see
something
in
the
water

exclaimed

clambering
to
his
feet
upon
the
yard
there
said
the
child
directing
attention
to
the
portion
of

that
was
visible

fixed
his
gaze
intently
for
a
moment

shouted

chapter
iii
a
rescue
at
the
sound
of
dick
voice
all
the
crew
in
a
moment
were
upon
the
alert
the
men
who
were
not
on
watch
rushed
to
the
deck
and
captain
hull
hurried
from
his
cabin
to
the
bows
weldon
nan
and
even
cousin
benedict
leaned
over
the
starboard
taffrails
eager
to
get
a
glimpse
of
what
had
thus
suddenly
attracted
the
attention
of
the
young
apprentice
with
his
usual
indifference
negoro
did
not
leave
his
cabin
and
was
the
only
person
on
board
who
did
not
share
the
general
excitement
speculations
were
soon
rife
as
to
what
could
be
the
nature
of
the
floating
object
which
could
be
discerned
about
three
miles
ahead
suggestions
of
various
character
were
freely
made
one
of
the
sailors
declared
that
it
looked
to
him
only
like
an
abandoned
raft
but
weldon
observed
quickly
that
if
it
were
a
raft
it
might
be
carrying
some
unfortunate
shipwrecked
men
who
must
be
rescued
if
possible
cousin
benedict
asserted
that
it
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
huge
but
the
captain
soon
arrived
at
the
conviction
that
it
was
the
hull
of
a
vessel
that
had
heeled
over
on
to
its
side
an
opinion
with
which
dick
thoroughly
coincided
and
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
believed
he
could
make
out
the
copper
keel
glittering
in
the
sun
luff
bolton
luff
shouted
captain
hull
to
the
helmsman
we
will
at
any
rate
lose
no
time
in
getting
alongside
ay
ay
sir
answered
the
helmsman
and
the
pilgrim
in
an
instant
was
steered
according
to
orders
in
spite
however
of
the
convictions
of
the
captain
and
dick
cousin
benedict
would
not
be
moved
from
his
opinion
that
the
object
of
their
curiosity
was
some
huge
cetacean
it
is
certainly
dead
then
remarked
weldon
it
is
perfectly
motionless
oh
that
because
it
is
asleep
said
benedict
who
although
he
would
have
willingly
given
up
all
the
whales
in
the
ocean
for
one
rare
specimen
of
an
insect
yet
could
not
surrender
his
own
belief
easy
bolton
easy
shouted
the
captain
when
they
were
getting
nearer
the
floating
mass
do
let
us
be
running
foul
of
the
thing
no
good
could
come
from
knocking
a
hole
in
our
side
keep
out
from
it
a
good
cable
length
ay
ay
sir
replied
the
helmsman
in
his
usual
cheery
way
and
by
an
easy
turn
of
the
helm
the
pilgrim
course
was
slightly
modified
so
as
to
avoid
all
fear
of
collision
the
excitement
of
the
sailors
by
this
time
had
become
more
intense
ever
since
the
distance
had
been
less
than
a
mile
all
doubt
had
vanished
and
it
was
certain
that
what
was
attracting
their
attention
was
the
hull
of
a
capsized
ship
they
knew
well
enough
the
established
rule
that
a
third
of
all
salvage
is
the
right
of
the
finders
and
they
were
filled
with
the
hope
that
the
hull
they
were
nearing
might
contain
an
undamaged
cargo
and
be
a
good
haul
to
compensate
them
for
their
in
the
last
season
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
and
the
pilgrim
was
within
half
a
mile
of
the
deserted
vessel
facing
her
starboard
side
to
her
bulwarks
she
had
heeled
over
so
completely
that
it
would
have
been
next
to
impossible
to
stand
upon
her
deck
of
her
masts
nothing
was
to
be
seen
a
few
ends
of
cordage
were
all
that
remained
of
her
shrouds
and
the
chains
were
hanging
all
broken
on
the
starboard
flank
was
an
enormous
hole
something
or
other
has
run
foul
of
her
said
dick
no
doubt
of
that
replied
the
captain
the
only
wonder
is
that
she
did
not
sink
immediately
oh
how
i
hope
the
poor
crew
have
been
saved
exclaimed
mrs
weldon
most
probably
replied
the
captain
they
would
all
have
taken
to
the
boats
it
is
as
likely
as
not
that
the
ship
which
did
the
mischief
would
continue
its
course
quite
unconcerned
surely
you
can
not
mean
cried
mrs
weldon
that
any
one
could
be
capable
of
such
inhumanity
only
too
probable
answered
captain
hull
unfortunately
such
instances
are
very
far
from
rare
he
scanned
the
drifting
ship
carefully
and
continued
no
i
can
not
see
any
sign
of
boats
here
i
should
guess
that
the
crew
have
made
an
attempt
to
get
to
land
at
such
a
distance
as
this
however
from
america
or
from
the
islands
of
the
pacific
i
should
be
afraid
that
it
must
be
hopeless
is
it
not
possible
asked
mrs
weldon
that
some
poor
creature
may
still
survive
on
board
who
can
tell
what
has
happened
hardly
likely
madam
otherwise
there
would
have
been
some
sort
of
a
signal
in
sight
but
it
is
a
matter
about
which
we
will
make
sure
the
captain
waved
his
hand
a
little
in
the
direction
in
which
he
wished
to
go
and
said
quietly
luff
bolton
luff
a
bit
the
pilgrim
by
this
time
was
not
much
more
than
three
cables
lengths
from
the
ship
there
was
still
no
token
of
her
being
otherwise
than
utterly
deserted
when
dick
sands
suddenly
exclaimed
hark
if
i
am
not
much
mistaken
that
is
a
dog
barking
every
one
listened
attentively
it
was
no
fancy
on
dick
part
sure
enough
a
stifled
barking
could
be
heard
as
if
some
unfortunate
dog
had
been
imprisoned
beneath
the
hatchways
but
as
the
deck
was
not
yet
visible
it
was
impossible
at
present
to
determine
the
precise
truth
mrs
weldon
pleaded
if
it
is
only
a
dog
captain
let
it
be
saved
oh
yes
yes
mamma
the
dog
must
be
saved
cried
little
jack
i
will
go
and
get
a
bit
of
sugar
ready
for
it
illustration
negoro
had
approached
without
being
noticed
by
any
one
a
bit
of
sugar
my
child
will
not
be
much
for
a
starved
dog
then
it
shall
have
my
soup
and
i
will
do
without
said
the
boy
and
he
kept
shouting
good
dog
good
dog
until
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
heard
the
animal
responding
to
his
call
the
vessels
were
now
scarcely
three
hundred
feet
apart
the
barking
was
more
and
more
distinct
and
presently
a
great
dog
was
seen
clinging
to
the
starboard
netting
it
barked
more
desperately
than
ever
howick
said
captain
hull
calling
to
the
boatswain
heave
to
and
lower
the
small
boat
the
sails
were
soon
trimmed
so
as
to
bring
the
schooner
to
a
standstill
within
half
a
cable
length
of
the
disabled
craft
the
boat
was
lowered
and
the
captain
and
dick
with
a
couple
of
sailors
went
on
board
the
dog
kept
up
a
continual
yelping
it
made
the
most
vigourous
efforts
to
retain
its
hold
upon
the
netting
but
perpetually
slipped
backwards
and
fell
off
again
upon
the
inclining
deck
it
was
soon
manifest
however
that
all
the
noise
the
creature
was
making
was
not
directed
exclusively
towards
those
who
were
coming
to
its
rescue
and
weldon
could
not
divest
herself
of
the
impression
that
there
must
be
some
survivors
still
on
board
all
at
once
the
animal
changed
its
gestures
instead
of
the
crouching
attitude
and
supplicating
whine
with
which
it
seemed
to
be
imploring
the
compassion
of
those
who
were
nearing
it
it
suddenly
appeared
to
become
bursting
with
violence
and
furious
with
rage
what
ails
the
brute
exclaimed
captain
hull
but
already
the
boat
was
on
the
farther
side
of
the
wrecked
ship
and
the
captain
was
not
in
a
position
to
see
that
negoro
the
cook
had
just
come
on
to
the
schooner
deck
or
that
it
was
obvious
that
it
was
against
him
that
the
dog
had
broken
out
in
such
obstreperous
fury
negoro
had
approached
without
being
noticed
by
any
one
he
made
his
way
to
the
forecastle
whence
without
a
word
or
look
of
surprise
he
gazed
a
moment
at
the
dog
knitted
his
brow
and
silent
and
unobserved
as
he
had
come
retired
to
his
kitchen
as
the
boat
had
rounded
the
stern
of
the
drifting
hull
it
had
been
observed
that
the
one
word
waldeck
was
painted
on
the
but
that
there
was
no
intimation
of
the
port
to
which
the
ship
belonged
to
captain
hull
experienced
eye
however
certain
details
of
construction
gave
a
decided
confirmation
to
the
probability
suggested
by
her
name
that
she
was
of
american
build
of
what
had
once
been
a
fine
brig
of
tons
burden
this
hopeless
wreck
was
now
all
that
remained
the
large
hole
near
the
bows
indicated
the
place
where
the
disastrous
shock
had
occurred
but
as
in
the
heeling
over
this
aperture
had
been
carried
some
five
or
six
feet
above
the
water
the
vessel
had
escaped
the
immediate
foundering
which
must
otherwise
have
ensued
but
still
it
wanted
only
the
rising
of
a
heavy
swell
to
submerge
the
ship
at
any
time
in
a
few
minutes
it
did
not
take
many
more
strokes
to
bring
the
boat
close
to
the
larboard
bulwark
which
was
half
out
of
the
water
and
captain
hull
obtained
a
view
of
the
whole
length
of
the
deck
it
was
clear
from
end
to
end
both
masts
had
been
snapped
off
within
two
feet
of
their
sockets
and
had
been
swept
away
with
shrouds
stays
and
rigging
not
a
single
spar
was
to
be
seen
floating
anywhere
within
sight
of
the
wreck
a
circumstance
from
which
it
was
to
be
inferred
that
several
days
at
least
had
elapsed
since
the
catastrophe
meantime
the
dog
sliding
down
from
the
taffrail
got
to
the
centre
hatchway
which
was
open
here
it
continued
to
bark
alternately
directing
its
eyes
above
deck
and
below
look
at
that
dog
said
dick
i
begin
to
think
there
must
be
somebody
on
board
if
so
answered
the
captain
he
must
have
died
of
hunger
the
water
of
course
has
flooded
the
no
said
dick
that
dog
would
look
like
that
if
there
were
nobody
there
alive
illustration
the
dog
began
to
swim
slowly
and
with
manifest
weakness
towards
the
boat
taking
the
boat
as
close
as
was
prudent
to
the
wreck
the
captain
and
dick
called
and
whistled
repeatedly
to
the
dog
which
after
a
while
let
itself
slip
into
the
sea
and
began
to
swim
slowly
and
with
manifest
weakness
towards
the
boat
as
soon
as
it
was
lifted
in
the
animal
instead
of
devouring
the
piece
of
bread
that
was
offered
him
made
its
way
to
a
bucket
containing
a
few
drops
of
fresh
water
and
began
eagerly
to
lap
them
up
the
poor
wretch
is
dying
of
thirst
said
dick
it
soon
appeared
that
the
dog
was
very
far
from
being
engrossed
with
its
own
interests
the
boat
was
being
pushed
back
a
few
yards
in
order
to
allow
the
captain
to
ascertain
the
most
convenient
place
to
get
alongside
the
waldeck
when
the
creature
seized
dick
by
the
jacket
and
set
up
a
howl
that
was
almost
human
in
its
piteousness
it
was
evidently
in
a
state
of
alarm
that
the
boat
was
not
going
to
return
to
the
wreck
the
dog
meaning
could
not
be
misunderstood
the
boat
was
accordingly
brought
against
the
larboard
side
of
the
vessel
and
while
the
two
sailors
lashed
her
securely
to
the
waldeck
captain
hull
and
dick
with
the
dog
persistently
accompanying
them
clambered
after
some
difficulty
to
the
open
hatchway
between
the
stumps
of
the
masts
and
made
their
way
into
the
hold
it
was
half
full
of
water
but
perfectly
destitute
of
cargo
its
sole
contents
being
the
ballast
sand
which
had
slipped
to
larboard
and
now
served
to
keep
the
vessel
on
her
side
one
glance
was
sufficient
to
convince
the
captain
that
there
was
no
salvage
to
be
effected
there
is
nothing
here
nobody
here
he
said
so
i
see
said
the
apprentice
who
had
made
his
way
to
the
extreme
of
the
hold
then
we
have
only
to
go
up
again
remarked
the
captain
they
ascended
the
ladder
but
no
sooner
did
they
reappear
upon
the
deck
than
the
dog
barking
irrepressibly
began
trying
manifestly
to
drag
them
towards
the
stern
yielding
to
what
might
be
called
the
importunities
of
the
dog
they
followed
him
to
the
poop
and
there
by
the
dim
glimmer
admitted
by
the
captain
hull
made
out
the
forms
of
five
bodies
motionless
and
apparently
lifeless
stretched
upon
the
floor
one
after
another
dick
hastily
examined
them
all
and
emphatically
declared
it
to
be
his
opinion
that
not
one
or
them
had
actually
ceased
to
breathe
whereupon
the
captain
did
not
lose
a
minute
in
summoning
the
two
sailors
to
his
aid
and
although
it
was
far
from
an
easy
task
he
succeeded
in
getting
the
five
unconscious
men
who
were
all
negroes
conveyed
safely
to
the
boat
the
dog
followed
apparently
satisfied
with
all
possible
speed
the
boat
made
its
way
back
again
to
the
pilgrim
a
was
lowered
from
the
mainyard
and
the
unfortunate
men
were
raised
to
the
deck
poor
things
said
weldon
as
she
looked
compassionately
on
the
motionless
forms
but
they
are
not
dead
cried
dick
eagerly
they
are
not
dead
we
shall
save
them
all
yet
what
the
matter
with
them
asked
cousin
benedict
looking
at
them
with
utter
bewilderment
we
shall
hear
all
about
them
soon
i
dare
say
said
the
captain
smiling
but
first
we
will
give
them
a
few
drops
of
rum
in
some
water
cousin
benedict
smiled
in
return
negoro
shouted
the
captain
at
the
sound
of
the
name
the
dog
who
had
hitherto
been
quite
passive
growled
fiercely
showed
his
teeth
and
exhibited
every
sign
of
rage
the
cook
did
not
answer
negoro
again
the
captain
shouted
and
the
dog
became
yet
more
angry
at
this
second
summons
negoro
slowly
left
his
kitchen
but
no
sooner
had
he
shown
his
face
upon
the
deck
than
the
animal
made
a
rush
at
him
and
would
unquestionably
have
seized
him
by
the
throat
if
the
man
had
not
knocked
him
back
with
a
poker
which
he
had
brought
with
him
in
his
hand
the
infuriated
beast
was
secured
by
the
sailors
and
prevented
from
inflicting
any
serious
injury
do
you
know
this
dog
asked
the
captain
know
him
not
i
i
have
never
set
eyes
on
the
brute
in
my
life
strange
muttered
dick
to
himself
there
is
some
mystery
here
we
shall
see
chapter
iv
the
survivors
of
the
waldeck
in
spite
of
the
watchfulness
of
the
french
and
english
cruisers
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
is
still
extensively
carried
on
in
all
parts
of
equatorial
africa
and
that
year
after
year
vessels
loaded
with
slaves
leave
the
coasts
of
angola
and
mozambique
to
transport
their
living
freight
to
many
quarters
even
of
the
civilized
world
of
this
captain
hull
was
well
aware
and
although
he
was
now
in
a
latitude
which
was
comparatively
little
traversed
by
such
slavers
he
could
not
help
almost
involuntarily
conjecturing
that
the
negroes
they
had
just
found
must
be
part
of
a
which
was
on
its
way
to
some
colony
of
the
pacific
if
this
were
so
he
would
at
least
have
the
satisfaction
of
announcing
to
them
that
they
had
regained
their
freedom
from
the
moment
that
they
came
on
board
the
pilgrim
whilst
these
thoughts
were
passing
through
his
mind
weldon
assisted
by
nan
and
the
ever
active
dick
sands
was
doing
everything
in
her
power
to
restore
consciousness
to
the
poor
sufferers
the
judicious
administration
of
fresh
water
and
a
limited
quantity
of
food
soon
had
the
effect
of
making
them
revive
and
when
they
were
restored
to
their
senses
it
was
found
that
the
eldest
of
them
a
man
of
about
sixty
years
of
age
who
immediately
regained
his
powers
of
speech
was
able
to
reply
in
good
english
to
all
the
questions
that
were
put
to
him
in
answer
to
captain
hull
inquiry
whether
they
were
not
slaves
the
old
negro
proudly
stated
that
he
and
his
companions
were
all
free
american
citizens
belonging
to
the
state
of
pennsylvania
illustration
weldon
assisted
by
nan
and
the
ever
active
dick
sands
was
doing
everything
in
her
power
to
restore
consciousness
to
the
poor
sufferers
then
let
me
assure
you
my
friend
said
the
captain
you
have
by
no
means
compromised
your
liberty
in
having
been
brought
on
board
the
american
schooner
not
merely
as
it
seemed
on
account
of
his
age
and
experience
but
rather
because
of
a
certain
superiority
and
greater
energy
of
character
this
old
man
was
tacitly
recognized
as
the
spokesman
of
his
party
he
freely
communicated
all
the
information
that
captain
hull
required
to
hear
and
by
degrees
he
related
all
the
details
of
his
adventures
he
said
that
his
name
was
tom
and
that
when
he
was
only
six
years
of
age
he
had
been
sold
as
a
slave
and
brought
from
his
home
in
africa
to
the
united
states
but
by
the
act
of
emancipation
he
had
long
since
recovered
his
freedom
his
companions
who
were
all
much
younger
than
himself
their
ages
ranging
from
to
thirty
were
all
their
parents
having
been
emancipated
before
their
birth
so
that
no
white
man
had
ever
exercised
upon
them
the
rights
of
ownership
one
of
them
was
his
own
son
his
name
was
bat
an
abbreviation
of
bartholomew
and
there
were
three
others
named
austin
actæon
and
hercules
all
four
of
them
were
specimens
of
that
stalwart
race
that
commands
so
high
a
price
in
the
african
market
and
in
spite
of
the
emaciation
induced
by
their
recent
sufferings
their
muscular
frames
betokened
a
strong
and
healthy
constitution
their
manner
bore
the
impress
of
that
solid
education
which
is
given
in
the
north
american
schools
and
their
speech
had
lost
all
trace
of
the
a
dialect
without
articles
or
inflexions
which
since
the
war
has
almost
died
out
in
the
united
states
three
years
ago
old
tom
stated
the
five
men
had
been
engaged
by
an
englishman
who
had
large
property
in
south
australia
to
work
upon
his
estates
near
melbourne
here
they
had
realized
a
considerable
profit
and
upon
the
completion
of
their
engagement
they
determined
to
return
with
their
savings
to
america
accordingly
on
the
of
january
after
paying
their
passage
in
the
ordinary
way
they
embarked
at
melbourne
on
board
the
waldeck
everything
went
on
well
for
seventeen
days
until
on
the
night
of
the
which
was
very
dark
they
were
run
into
by
a
great
steamer
they
were
all
asleep
in
their
berths
but
roused
by
the
shock
of
the
collision
which
was
extremely
severe
they
hurriedly
made
their
way
on
to
the
deck
the
scene
was
terrible
both
masts
were
gone
and
the
brig
although
the
water
had
not
absolutely
flooded
her
hold
so
as
to
make
her
sink
had
completely
heeled
over
on
her
side
captain
and
crew
had
entirely
disappeared
some
probably
having
been
dashed
into
the
sea
others
perhaps
having
saved
themselves
by
clinging
to
the
rigging
of
the
ship
which
had
fouled
them
and
which
could
be
distinguished
through
the
darkness
rapidly
receding
in
the
distance
for
a
while
they
were
paralyzed
but
they
soon
awoke
to
the
conviction
that
they
were
left
alone
upon
a
and
disabled
hull
twelve
hundred
miles
from
the
nearest
land
weldon
was
loud
in
her
expression
of
indignation
that
any
captain
should
have
the
barbarity
to
abandon
an
unfortunate
vessel
with
which
his
own
carelessness
had
brought
him
into
collision
it
would
be
bad
enough
she
said
for
a
driver
on
a
public
road
when
it
might
be
presumed
that
help
would
be
forthcoming
to
pass
on
unconcerned
after
causing
an
accident
to
another
vehicle
but
how
much
more
shameful
to
desert
the
injured
on
the
open
sea
where
the
victims
of
his
incompetence
could
have
no
chance
of
obtaining
succour
captain
hull
could
only
repeat
what
he
had
said
before
that
incredibly
atrocious
as
it
might
seem
such
inhumanity
was
far
from
rare
on
resuming
his
story
tom
said
that
he
and
his
companions
soon
found
that
they
had
no
means
left
for
getting
away
from
the
capsized
brig
both
the
boats
had
been
crushed
in
the
collision
so
that
they
had
no
alternative
except
to
await
the
appearance
of
a
passing
vessel
whilst
the
wreck
was
drifting
hopelessly
along
under
the
action
of
the
currents
this
accounted
for
the
fact
of
their
being
found
so
far
south
of
their
proper
course
for
the
next
ten
days
the
negroes
had
subsisted
upon
a
few
scraps
of
food
that
they
found
in
the
stern
cabin
but
as
the
store
room
was
entirely
under
water
they
were
quite
unable
to
obtain
a
drop
of
anything
to
drink
and
the
freshwater
tanks
that
had
been
lashed
to
the
deck
had
been
stove
in
at
the
time
of
the
catastrophe
tortured
with
thirst
the
poor
men
had
suffered
agonies
and
having
on
the
previous
night
entirely
lost
consciousness
they
must
soon
have
died
if
the
pilgrim
timely
arrival
had
not
effected
their
rescue
all
the
outlines
of
tom
narrative
were
fully
confirmed
by
the
other
negroes
captain
hull
could
see
no
reason
to
doubt
it
indeed
the
facts
seemed
to
speak
for
themselves
one
other
survivor
of
the
wreck
if
he
had
been
gifted
with
the
power
of
speech
would
doubtless
have
corroborated
the
testimony
this
was
the
dog
who
seemed
to
have
such
an
unaccountable
dislike
to
negoro
dingo
as
the
dog
was
named
belonged
to
the
fine
breed
of
mastiffs
peculiar
to
new
holland
it
was
not
however
from
australia
but
from
the
coast
of
west
africa
near
the
mouth
of
the
congo
that
the
animal
had
come
he
had
been
picked
up
there
two
years
previously
by
the
captain
of
the
waldeck
who
had
found
him
wandering
about
and
more
than
half
starved
the
initials
engraved
upon
his
collar
were
the
only
tokens
that
the
dog
had
a
past
history
of
his
own
after
he
had
been
taken
on
board
the
waldeck
he
remained
quite
unsociable
apparently
ever
pining
for
some
lost
master
whom
he
had
failed
to
find
in
the
desert
land
where
he
had
been
met
with
larger
than
the
dogs
of
the
pyrenees
dingo
was
a
magnificent
example
of
his
kind
standing
on
his
hind
legs
with
his
head
thrown
back
he
was
as
tall
as
a
man
his
agility
and
strength
would
have
made
him
a
sure
match
for
a
panther
and
he
would
not
have
flinched
at
facing
a
bear
his
fine
shaggy
coat
was
a
dark
tawny
colour
shading
off
somewhat
lighter
round
the
muzzle
and
his
long
bushy
tail
was
as
strong
as
a
lion
if
he
were
made
angry
no
doubt
he
might
become
a
most
formidable
foe
so
that
it
was
no
wonder
that
negoro
did
not
feel
altogether
gratified
at
his
reception
but
dingo
though
unsociable
was
not
savage
old
tom
said
that
on
board
the
waldeck
he
had
noticed
that
the
animal
seemed
to
have
a
particular
dislike
to
negroes
not
that
he
actually
attempted
to
do
them
any
harm
only
he
uniformly
avoided
them
giving
an
impression
that
he
must
have
been
systematically
by
the
natives
of
that
part
of
africa
in
which
he
had
been
found
during
the
ten
days
that
had
elapsed
since
the
collision
dingo
had
kept
resolutely
aloof
from
tom
and
his
companions
they
could
not
tell
what
he
had
been
feeding
on
they
only
knew
that
like
themselves
he
had
suffered
an
excruciating
thirst
such
had
been
the
experience
of
the
survivors
of
the
waldeck
their
situation
had
been
most
critical
even
if
they
survived
the
pangs
of
want
of
food
the
slightest
gale
or
the
most
inconsiderable
swell
might
at
any
moment
have
sunk
the
ship
and
had
it
not
been
that
calms
and
contrary
winds
had
contributed
to
the
opportune
arrival
of
the
pilgrim
an
inevitable
fate
was
before
them
their
corpses
must
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
captain
hull
act
of
humanity
however
would
not
be
complete
unless
he
succeeded
in
restoring
the
shipwrecked
men
to
their
homes
this
he
promised
to
do
after
completing
the
unlading
at
valparaiso
the
pilgrim
would
make
direct
for
california
where
as
weldon
assured
them
they
would
be
most
hospitably
received
by
her
husband
and
provided
with
the
necessary
means
for
returning
to
pennsylvania
the
five
men
who
as
the
consequence
of
the
shipwreck
had
lost
all
the
savings
of
their
last
three
years
of
toil
were
profoundly
grateful
to
their
benefactors
nor
poor
negroes
as
they
were
did
they
utterly
resign
the
hope
that
at
some
future
time
they
might
have
it
in
their
power
to
repay
the
debt
which
they
owed
their
deliverers

chapter
dingo
sagacity
meantime
the
pilgrim
pursued
her
course
keeping
as
much
as
possible
to
the
east
and
before
evening
closed
in
the
hull
of
the
waldeck
was
out
of
sight
captain
hull
still
continued
to
feel
uneasy
about
the
constant
prevalence
of
calms
not
that
for
himself
he
cared
much
about
the
delay
of
a
week
or
two
in
a
voyage
from
new
zealand
to
valparaiso
but
he
was
disappointed
at
the
prolonged
inconvenience
it
caused
to
his
lady
passenger
weldon
however
submitted
to
the
detention
very
philosophically
and
did
not
utter
a
word
of
complaint
the
captain
next
care
was
to
improvise
sleeping
accommodation
for
tom
and
his
four
associates
no
room
for
them
could
possibly
be
found
in
the
crew
quarters
so
that
their
berths
had
to
be
arranged
under
the
forecastle
and
as
long
as
the
weather
continued
fine
there
was
no
reason
why
the
negroes
accustomed
as
they
were
to
a
somewhat
rough
life
should
not
find
themselves
sufficiently
comfortable
after
this
incident
of
the
discovery
of
the
wreck
life
on
board
the
pilgrim
relapsed
into
its
ordinary
routine
with
the
wind
invariably
in
the
same
direction
the
sails
required
very
little
shifting
but
whenever
it
happened
as
occasionally
it
would
that
there
was
any
tacking
to
be
done
the
negroes
were
ever
ready
to
lend
a
helping
hand
and
the
rigging
would
creak
again
under
the
weight
of
hercules
a
great
strapping
fellow
six
feet
high
who
seemed
almost
to
require
ropes
of
extra
strength
made
for
his
special
use
hercules
became
at
once
a
great
favourite
with
little
jack
and
when
the
giant
lifted
him
like
a
doll
in
his
stalwart
arms
the
child
fairly
shrieked
with
delight
higher
higher
very
high
jack
would
say
sometimes
there
you
are
then
master
jack
hercules
would
reply
as
he
raised
him
aloft
am
i
heavy
asked
the
child
as
heavy
as
a
feather
then
lift
me
higher
still
cried
jack
as
high
as
ever
you
can
reach
and
hercules
with
the
child
two
feet
supported
on
his
huge
palm
would
walk
about
the
deck
with
him
like
an
acrobat
jack
all
the
time
endeavouring
with
vain
efforts
to
make
him
feel
his
weight
besides
dick
sands
and
hercules
jack
admitted
a
third
friend
to
his
companionship
this
was
dingo
the
dog
unsociable
as
he
had
been
on
board
the
waldeck
seemed
to
have
found
society
more
congenial
to
his
tastes
and
being
one
of
those
animals
that
are
fond
of
children
he
allowed
jack
to
do
with
him
almost
anything
he
pleased
the
child
however
never
thought
of
hurting
the
dog
in
any
way
and
it
was
doubtful
which
of
the
two
had
the
greater
enjoyment
of
their
mutual
sport
jack
found
a
live
dog
infinitely
more
entertaining
than
his
old
toy
upon
its
four
wheels
and
his
great
delight
was
to
mount
upon
dingo
back
when
the
animal
would
gallop
off
with
him
like
a
with
his
jockey
it
must
be
owned
that
one
result
of
this
intimacy
was
a
serious
diminution
of
the
supply
of
sugar
in
the
dingo
was
the
delight
of
all
the
crew
excepting
negoro
who
cautiously
avoided
coming
in
contact
with
an
animal
who
showed
such
unmistakable
symptoms
of
hostility
the
new
companions
that
jack
had
thus
found
did
not
in
the
least
make
him
forget
his
old
friend
dick
sands
who
devoted
all
his
leisure
time
to
him
as
assiduously
as
ever
weldon
regarded
their
intimacy
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
and
one
day
made
a
remark
to
that
effect
in
the
presence
of
captain
hull
illustration
there
you
are
then
master
jack
you
are
right
madam
said
the
captain
cordially
dick
is
a
capital
fellow
and
will
be
sure
to
be
a
sailor
he
has
an
instinct
which
is
little
short
of
a
genius
it
supplies
all
deficiencies
of
theory
considering
how
short
an
experience
and
how
little
instruction
he
has
had
it
is
quite
wonderful
how
much
he
knows
about
a
ship
certainly
for
his
age
assented
weldon
he
is
singularly
advanced
i
can
safely
say
that
i
have
never
had
a
fault
to
find
with
him
i
believe
that
it
is
my
husband
intention
after
this
voyage
to
let
him
have
systematic
training
in
navigation
so
that
he
may
be
able
ultimately
to
become
a
captain
i
have
no
misgivings
madam
replied
the
captain
there
is
every
reason
to
expect
that
he
will
be
an
honour
to
the
service
poor
orphan
said
the
lady
he
has
been
trained
in
a
hard
school
its
lessons
have
not
been
lost
upon
him
rejoined
captain
hull
they
have
taught
him
the
prime
lesson
that
he
has
his
own
way
to
make
in
the
world
the
eyes
of
the
two
speakers
turned
as
it
were
unwittingly
in
the
direction
where
dick
sands
happened
to
be
standing
he
was
at
the
helm
look
at
him
now
said
the
captain
see
how
steadily
he
keeps
his
eye
upon
the
fore
nothing
distracts
him
from
his
duty
he
is
as
much
to
be
depended
on
as
the
most
experienced
helmsman
it
was
a
capital
thing
for
him
that
he
began
his
training
as
a
nothing
like
it
begin
at
the
beginning
it
is
the
best
of
training
for
the
merchant
service
but
surely
interposed
weldon
you
would
not
deny
that
in
the
navy
there
have
been
many
good
officers
who
have
never
had
the
training
of
which
you
are
speaking
true
madam
but
yet
even
some
of
the
best
of
them
have
begun
at
the
lowest
step
of
the
ladder
for
instance
lord
nelson
just
at
this
instant
cousin
benedict
emerged
from
the
and
completely
absorbed
according
to
his
wont
in
his
own
pursuit
began
to
wander
up
and
down
the
deck
peering
into
the
interstices
of
the
network
rummaging
under
the
seats
and
drawing
his
long
fingers
along
the
cracks
in
the
floor
where
the
tar
had
crumbled
away
well
benedict
how
are
you
getting
on
asked
mrs
weldon
i
oh
well
enough
thank
you
he
replied
dreamily
but
i
wish
we
were
on
shore
what
were
you
looking
for
under
that
bench
said
captain
hull
insects
of
course
answered
benedict
i
am
always
looking
for
insects
but
do
you
know
benedict
said
weldon
that
captain
hull
is
far
too
particular
to
allow
any
vermin
on
the
deck
of
his
vessel
captain
hull
smiled
and
said
mrs
weldon
is
very
complimentary
but
i
am
really
inclined
to
hope
that
your
investigations
in
the
cabins
of
the
will
not
be
attended
with
much
success
cousin
benedict
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
a
manner
that
indicated
that
he
was
aware
that
the
cabins
could
furnish
nothing
attractive
in
the
way
of
insects
however
continued
the
captain
i
dare
say
down
in
the
hold
you
could
find
some
cockroaches
but
cockroaches
i
presume
would
be
of
little
or
no
interest
to
you
no
interest
cried
benedict
at
once
warmed
into
enthusiasm
why
are
they
not
the
very
orthoptera
that
roused
the
imprecations
of
virgil
and
horace
are
they
not
closely
allied
to
the
and
the
american
kakerlac
which
inhabit
i
should
rather
say
infest
interrupted
the
captain
easy
enough
to
see
sir
replied
benedict
stopping
short
with
amazement
that
you
are
not
an
entomologist
i
fear
i
must
plead
guilty
to
your
accusation
said
the
captain
you
must
not
expect
every
one
to
be
such
an
enthusiast
in
your
favourite
study
as
yourself
weldon
interposed
but
are
you
not
satisfied
with
the
result
of
your
explorations
in
new
zealand
yes
yes
answered
benedict
with
a
sort
of
hesitating
reluctance
i
must
not
say
i
was
dissatisfied
i
was
really
very
delighted
to
secure
that
new
staphylin
which
hitherto
had
never
been
seen
elsewhere
than
in
new
california
but
still
you
know
an
entomologist
is
always
craving
for
fresh
additions
to
his
collection
while
he
was
speaking
dingo
leaving
little
jack
who
was
romping
with
him
came
and
jumped
on
benedict
and
began
to
fawn
on
him
get
away
you
brute
he
exclaimed
thrusting
the
dog
aside
poor
dingo
good
dog
cried
jack
running
up
and
taking
the
huge
head
between
his
tiny
hands
your
interest
in
cockroaches
benedict
observed
the
captain
does
not
seem
to
extend
to
dogs
it
is
that
i
dislike
dogs
at
all
answered
benedict
but
this
creature
has
disappointed
me
how
do
you
mean
you
could
hardly
want
to
catalogue
him
with
the
diptera
or
hymenoptera
asked
mrs
weldon
laughingly
oh
not
at
all
replied
benedict
with
the
most
unmoved
gravity
but
i
understood
that
he
had
been
found
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
and
i
hoped
that
perhaps
he
might
have
brought
over
some
african
hemiptera
in
his
coat
but
i
have
searched
his
coat
well
over
and
over
again
without
finding
a
single
specimen
the
dog
has
disappointed
me
he
repeated
mournfully
i
can
only
hope
said
the
captain
that
if
you
had
found
anything
you
were
going
to
kill
it
instantly
benedict
looked
with
mute
astonishment
into
the
captain
face
in
a
moment
or
two
afterwards
he
said
i
suppose
sir
you
acknowledge
that
sir
john
franklin
was
an
eminent
member
of
your
profession
certainly
why
because
sir
john
would
never
take
away
the
life
of
the
most
insignificant
insect
it
is
related
of
him
that
when
he
had
once
been
incessantly
tormented
all
day
by
a
mosquito
at
last
he
found
it
on
the
back
of
his
hand
and
blew
it
off
saying
away
little
creature
the
world
is
large
enough
for
both
you
and
me
that
little
anecdote
of
yours
benedict
said
the
captain
smiling
is
a
good
deal
older
than
sir
john
franklin
it
is
told
in
nearly
the
same
words
about
uncle
toby
in
sterne
shandy
only
there
it
was
not
a
mosquito
it
was
a
common
fly
and
was
uncle
toby
an
entomologist
asked
benedict
did
he
ever
really
live
no
said
the
captain
he
was
only
a
character
in
a
novel
cousin
benedict
gave
a
look
of
utter
contempt
and
captain
hull
and
mrs
weldon
could
not
resist
laughing
such
is
only
one
instance
of
the
way
in
which
cousin
benedict
invariably
brought
it
about
that
all
conversation
with
him
ultimately
turned
upon
his
favourite
pursuit
and
all
along
throughout
the
monotonous
hours
of
smooth
sailing
while
the
pilgrim
was
making
her
little
headway
to
the
east
he
showed
his
own
devotion
to
his
pet
science
by
seeking
to
enlist
new
disciples
first
of
all
he
tried
his
powers
of
persuasion
upon
dick
sands
but
soon
finding
that
the
young
apprentice
had
no
taste
for
entomological
mysteries
he
gave
him
up
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
negroes
nor
was
he
much
more
successful
with
them
one
after
another
tom
bat
actæon
and
austin
had
all
withdrawn
themselves
from
his
instructions
and
the
class
at
last
was
reduced
to
the
single
person
of
hercules
but
in
him
the
enthusiastic
naturalist
thought
he
had
discovered
a
latent
talent
which
could
distinguish
between
a
parasite
and
a
thysanura
hercules
accordingly
submitted
to
pass
a
considerable
portion
of
his
leisure
in
the
observation
of
every
variety
of
coleoptera
he
was
encouraged
to
study
the
extensive
collection
of
and
and
although
at
times
the
enthusiast
trembled
to
see
some
of
his
most
delicate
and
fragile
specimens
in
the
huge
grasp
of
his
pupil
he
soon
learned
that
the
man
gentle
docility
was
a
sufficient
guarantee
against
his
clumsiness
while
the
science
of
entomology
was
thus
occupying
its
two
votaries
weldon
was
giving
her
own
best
attention
to
the
education
of
master
jack
reading
and
writing
she
undertook
to
teach
herself
while
she
entrusted
the
instruction
in
arithmetic
to
the
care
of
dick
sands
under
the
conviction
that
a
child
of
five
years
will
make
a
much
more
rapid
progress
if
something
like
amusement
be
combined
with
his
lessons
weldon
would
not
teach
her
boy
to
spell
by
the
use
of
an
ordinary
school
primer
but
used
a
set
of
cubes
on
the
sides
of
which
the
various
letters
were
painted
in
red
after
first
making
a
word
and
showing
it
to
jack
she
set
him
to
put
it
together
without
her
help
and
it
was
astonishing
how
quickly
the
child
advanced
and
how
many
hours
he
would
spend
in
this
way
both
in
the
cabin
and
on
deck
there
were
more
than
fifty
cubes
which
besides
the
alphabet
included
all
the
digits
so
that
they
were
of
service
for
dick
sands
lessons
as
well
as
for
her
own
she
was
more
than
satisfied
with
her
device
on
the
morning
of
the
an
incident
occurred
which
could
not
fail
to
be
observed
as
somewhat
remarkable
jack
was
half
lying
half
sitting
on
the
deck
amusing
himself
with
his
letters
and
had
just
finished
putting
together
a
word
with
which
he
intended
to
puzzle
old
tom
who
with
his
hand
sheltering
his
eyes
was
pretending
not
to
see
the
difficulty
which
was
being
labouriously
prepared
to
bewilder
him
all
at
once
dingo
who
had
been
gambolling
round
the
child
made
a
sudden
pause
lifted
his
right
paw
and
wagged
his
tail
convulsively
then
darting
down
upon
a
capital
s
he
seized
it
in
his
mouth
and
carried
it
some
paces
away
oh
dingo
dingo
you
must
eat
my
letters
shouted
the
child
but
the
dog
had
already
dropped
the
block
of
wood
and
coming
back
again
picked
up
another
which
he
laid
quietly
by
the
side
of
the
first
this
time
it
was
a
capital
jack
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
which
brought
to
his
side
not
only
his
mother
but
the
captain
and
dick
who
were
both
on
deck
in
answer
to
their
inquiry
as
to
what
had
occurred
jack
cried
out
in
the
greatest
excitement
that
dingo
knew
how
to
read
at
any
rate
he
was
sure
that
he
knew
his
letters
dick
sands
smiled
and
stooped
to
take
back
the
letters
dingo
snarled
and
showed
his
teeth
but
the
apprentice
was
not
frightened
he
carried
his
point
and
replaced
the
two
blocks
among
the
rest
dingo
in
an
instant
pounced
upon
them
again
and
having
drawn
them
to
his
side
laid
a
paw
upon
each
of
them
as
if
to
signify
his
intention
of
retaining
them
in
his
possession
of
the
other
letters
of
the
alphabet
he
took
no
notice
at
all
it
is
very
strange
said
weldon
he
has
picked
out
s
v
again
s
v
repeated
the
captain
thoughtfully
are
not
those
the
letters
that
form
the
initials
on
his
collar
and
turning
to
the
old
negro
he
continued
tom
did
you
say
that
this
dog
did
not
always
belong
to
the
captain
of
the
to
the
best
of
my
belief
replied
tom
the
captain
had
only
had
him
about
two
years
i
often
heard
him
tell
how
he
found
him
at
the
mouth
of
the
congo
do
you
suppose
that
he
never
knew
where
the
animal
came
from
or
to
whom
he
had
previously
belonged
asked
captain
hull
never
answered
tom
shaking
his
head
a
lost
dog
is
worse
to
identify
than
a
lost
child
you
see
he
ca
make
himself
understood
any
way
the
captain
made
no
answer
but
stood
musing
weldon
interrupted
him
these
letters
captain
seem
to
be
recalling
something
to
your
recollection
i
can
hardly
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
weldon
he
replied
but
i
can
not
help
associating
them
with
the
fate
of
a
brave
explorer
whom
do
you
mean
said
the
lady
in
just
two
years
ago
the
captain
continued
a
french
traveller
under
the
auspices
of
the
geographical
society
of
paris
set
out
for
the
purpose
of
crossing
africa
from
west
to
east
his
was
the
mouth
of
the
congo
and
his
exit
was
designed
to
be
as
near
as
possible
to
cape
deldago
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
rovouma
of
which
he
was
to
ascertain
the
true
course
the
name
of
this
man
was
samuel
vernon
and
i
confess
it
strikes
me
as
somewhat
a
strange
coincidence
that
the
letters
engraved
on
dingo
collar
should
be
vernon
initials
illustration
jack
cried
out
in
the
greatest
excitement
that
dingo
knew
how
to
read
is
nothing
known
about
this
traveller
asked
weldon
nothing
was
ever
heard
of
him
after
his
first
departure
it
appears
quite
certain
that
he
failed
to
reach
the
east
coast
and
it
can
only
be
conjectured
either
that
he
died
upon
his
way
or
that
he
was
made
prisoner
by
the
natives
and
if
so
and
this
dog
ever
belonged
to
him
the
animal
might
have
made
his
way
back
to
the
where
just
about
the
time
that
would
be
likely
the
captain
of
the
picked
him
up
but
you
have
no
reason
to
suppose
captain
hull
that
vernon
ever
owned
a
dog
of
this
description
i
own
i
never
heard
of
it
said
the
captain
but
still
the
impression
fixes
itself
on
my
mind
that
the
dog
must
have
been
his
how
he
came
to
know
one
letter
from
another
it
is
not
for
me
to
pretend
to
say
look
at
him
now
madam
he
seems
not
only
to
be
reading
the
letters
for
himself
but
to
be
inviting
us
to
come
and
read
them
with
him
whilst
weldon
was
watching
the
dog
with
much
amusement
dick
sands
who
had
listened
to
the
previous
conversation
took
the
opportunity
of
asking
the
captain
whether
the
traveller
vernon
had
started
on
his
expedition
quite
alone
that
is
really
more
than
i
can
tell
you
my
boy
answered
captain
hull
but
i
should
almost
take
it
for
granted
that
he
would
have
a
considerable
retinue
of
natives
the
captain
spoke
without
being
aware
that
negoro
had
meanwhile
quietly
stolen
on
deck
at
first
his
presence
was
quite
unnoticed
and
no
one
observed
the
peculiar
glance
with
which
he
looked
at
the
two
letters
over
which
dingo
still
persisted
in
keeping
guard
the
dog
however
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
the
cook
than
he
began
to
bristle
with
rage
whereupon
negoro
with
a
threatening
gesture
which
seemed
half
involuntary
withdrew
immediately
to
his
accustomed
quarters
the
incident
did
not
escape
the
captain
observation
no
doubt
he
said
there
is
some
mystery
here
and
he
was
pondering
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
when
dick
sands
spoke
do
you
think
it
very
singular
sir
that
this
dog
should
have
such
a
knowledge
of
the
alphabet
jack
here
put
in
his
word
my
mamma
has
told
me
about
a
dog
whose
name
was
munito
who
could
read
as
well
as
a
schoolmaster
and
could
play
dominoes
weldon
smiled
i
am
afraid
my
child
that
that
dog
was
not
quite
so
learned
as
you
imagine
i
do
suppose
he
knew
one
letter
from
another
but
his
master
who
was
a
clever
american
having
found
out
that
the
animal
had
a
very
keen
sense
of
hearing
taught
him
some
curious
tricks
what
sort
of
tricks
asked
dick
who
was
almost
as
much
interested
as
little
jack
when
he

a
lot
of
letters
like
yours
jack
were
spread
out
upon
a
table
and
munito
would
put
together
any
word
that
the
company
should
propose
either
aloud
or
in
a
whisper
to
his
master
the
creature
would
walk
about
until
he
stopped
at
the
very
letter
which
was
wanted
the
secret
of
it
all
was
that
the
dog
owner
gave
him
a
signal
when
he
was
to
stop
by
rattling
a
little
in
his
pocket
making
a
slight
noise
that
only
the
dog
ears
were
acute
enough
to
perceive
dick
was
highly
amused
and
said
but
that
was
a
dog
who
could
do
nothing
wonderful
without
his
master
just
so
answered
weldon
and
it
surprises
me
very
much
to
see
dingo
picking
out
these
letters
without
a
master
to
direct
him
illustration
negoro
with
a
threatening
gesture
that
seemed
half
involuntary
withdrew
immediately
to
his
accustomed
quarters
the
more
one
thinks
of
it
the
more
strange
it
is
said
captain
hull
but
after
all
dingo
sagacity
is
not
greater
than
that
of
the
dog
which
rang
the
convent
bell
in
order
to
get
at
the
dish
that
was
reserved
for
passing
beggars
nor
than
that
of
the
dog
who
had
to
turn
a
spit
every
other
day
and
never
could
be
induced
to
work
when
it
was
not
his
proper
day
dingo
evidently
has
no
acquaintance
with
any
other
letters
except
the
two
s
v
and
some
circumstance
which
we
can
never
guess
has
made
him
familiar
with
them
what
a
pity
he
can
not
talk
exclaimed
the
apprentice
we
should
know
why
it
is
that
he
always
shows
his
teeth
at
negoro
and
tremendous
teeth
they
are
observed

captain
as

that
moment
opened
his
mouth
and
made
a
display
of
his
formidable
fangs

a

in
sight
it
was
only
what
might
be
expected
that
the
dog
singular
exhibition
of
sagacity
should
repeatedly
form
a
subject
of
conversation
between
weldon
the
captain
and
dick
the
young
apprentice
in
particular
began
to
entertain
a
lurking
feeling
of
distrust
towards
negoro
although
it
must
be
owned
that
the
man
conduct
in
general
afforded
no
tangible
grounds
for
suspicion
nor
as
it
only
among
the
stern
passengers
that
dingo
remarkable
feat
was
discussed
amongst
the
crew
in
the
bow
the
dog
not
only
soon
gained
the
reputation
of
being
able
to
read
but
was
almost
credited
with
being
able
to
write
too
as
well
as
any
sailor
among
them
indeed
the
chief
wonder
was
that
he
did
not
speak
perhaps
he
can
suggested
bolton
the
helmsman
and
likely
enough
some
fine
day
we
shall
have
him
coming
to
ask
about
our
bearings
and
to
inquire
which
way
the
wind
lies
ah
why
not
assented
another
sailor
parrots
talk
and
magpies
talk
why
should
a
dog
for
my
part
i
should
guess
it
must
be
easier
to
speak
with
a
mouth
than
with
a
beak
of
course
it
is
said
howick
the
boatswain
only
a
quadruped
has
never
yet
been
known
to
do
it
perhaps
however
the
worthy
fellow
would
have
been
amazed
to
hear
that
a
certain
danish
once
possesed
a
dog
that
could
actually
pronounce
quite
distinctly
nearly
twenty
different
words
demonstrating
that
the
construction
of
the
glottis
the
aperture
at
the
top
of
the
windpipe
was
adapted
for
the
emission
of
regular
sounds
of
course
the
animal
attached
no
meaning
to
the
words
it
uttered
any
more
than
a
parrot
or
a
jay
can
comprehend
their
own
chatterings

this
dingo
is
nothing
out
of
the
way
thus
unconsciously
dingo
had
become
the
hero
of
the
hour
on
several
separate
occasions
captain
hull
repeated
the
experiment
of
spreading
out
the
blocks
before
him
but
invariably
with
the
same
result
the
dog
never
failed
without
the
slightest
hesitation
to
pick
out
the
two
letters
leaving
all
the
rest
of
the
alphabet
quite
unnoticed
cousin
benedict
alone
somewhat
ostentatiously
professed
to
take
no
interest
in
the
circumstance
you
can
not
suppose
he
said
to
captain
hull
after
various
repetitions
of
the
trick
that
dogs
are
to
be
reckoned
the
only
animals
endowed
with
intelligence
rats
you
know
will
always
leave
a
sinking
ship
and

invariably
raise
their

before
the
approach

did
not
the
horses
of
nicomedes
scanderberg
and
oppian
die
of
grief
for
the
loss
of
their
masters
have
there
not
been
instances
of
donkeys
with
wonderful
memories
birds
too
have
been
trained
to
do
the
most
remarkable
things
they
have
been
taught
to
write
word
after
word
at
their
master
dictation
there
are
cockatoos
who
can
count
the
people
in
a
room
as
accurately
as
a
mathematician
and
have
you
heard
of
the
old
cardinal
parrot
that
he
would
not
part
with
for
a
hundred
gold
crowns
because
it
could
repeat
the
apostles
creed
from
beginning
to
end
without

continued
warming
into
enthusiasm
how
marvellously
they
vindicate
the
axiom

not
the

of

the
very
models
for
the
architects
of

city
has
the
of
the
aquatic
argyroneta
ever
been
surpassed
by
the
invention
of
the
most
skilful
student
of
mechanical
art
and
can
not
fleas
go
through
a
drill
and
fire

gun
as
well
as
the
most
accomplished
artilleryman
this
dingo
is
nothing
out
of
the
way
i
suppose
he
belongs
to
some
unclassed
species
of
mastiff
perhaps
one
day
or
other
he
may
come
to
be
identified
as
the
of
new
zealand
the
worthy
entomologist
delivered
this
and
various
similar
harangues
but
dingo
nevertheless
retained
his
high
place
in
the
general
estimation
and
by
the
occupants
of
the
forecastle
was
regarded
as
little
short
of
a
phenomenon
the
feeling
otherwise
universal
was
not
in
any
degree
shared
by
negoro
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
man
would
have
been
tempted
to
some
foul
play
with
the
dog
if
the
open
sympathies
of
the
crew
had
not
kept
him
in
check
more
than
ever
he
studiously
avoided
coming
in
contact
in
any
way
with
the
animal
and
dick
sands
in
his
own
mind
was
quite
convinced
that
since
the
incident
of
the
letters
the
cook
hatred
of
the
dog
had
become
still
more
intense
after
continual
alternations
with
long
and
wearisome
calms
the
wind
perceptibly
moderated
and
on
the
both
captain
hull
really
began
to
hope
that
such
a
change
would
ensue
as
to
allow
the
schooner
to
run
straight
before
the
wind
nineteen
days
had
elapsed
since
the
pilgrim
had
left
auckland
a
period
not
so
long
but
that
with
a
favourable
breeze
it
might
be
made
up
at
last
some
days
however
were
yet
to
elapse
before
the
wind
veered
round
to
the
anticipated
quarter
it
has
been
already
stated
that
this
portion
of
the
pacific
is
almost
always
deserted
it
is
out
of
the
line
of
the
american
and
australian
and
except
a
whaler
had
been
brought
into
it
by
some
such
exceptional
circumstances
as
the
pilgrim
it
was
quite
unusual
to
see
one
in
this
latitude
but
however
void
of
traffic
was
the
surface
of
the
sea
to
none
but
an
unintelligent
mind
could
it
appear
monotonous
or
barren
of
interest
the
poetry
of
the
ocean
breathes
forth
in
its
minute
and
almost
imperceptible
changes
a
marine
plant
a
tuft
of
seaweed
lightly
furrowing
the
water
a
drifting
spar
with
its
unknown
history
may
afford
unlimited
scope
for
the
imagination
every
little
drop
passing
in
its
process
of
evaporation
backwards
and
forwards
from
sea
to
sky
might
perchance
reveal
its
own
special
secret

happy
are
those
minds
which
are
capable
of
a
due
appreciation
of

would
take

above

as
below
the
restless
flood
is
ever
teaming
with

and
the
passengers
on

derived
no
little
amusement
from
watching
great
flocks
of

migrating
northwards
to

the
rigour
of
the
polar
winter
and
ever

again
descending
in
rapid
flight
to
secure

dick
sands
would
take

and
now

a

and
thanks
to
weldon
former
instructions
would
bring
down
various
specimens
of
the
feathered
tribe
sometimes
white
petrels
would
congregate
in
considerable
numbers
near
the
schooner
and
sometimes
petrels
of
another
species
with
brown
borders
on
their
wings
would
come
in
sight

there
would
be
flocks
of
damiers
skimming
the
water
and
now
groups
of
penguins
whose
clumsy
gait
appears
so
ludicrous
on
shore
but
as
captain
hull
pointed
out
when
their
stumpy
wings
were
employed
as
fins
they
were
a
match
for
the
most
rapid
of
fish
so
that
sailors
have
often
mistaken
them
for
bonitos
high
over
head
huge
albatrosses
their
outspread
wings
measuring
ten
feet
from
tip
to
tip
would
soar
aloft
thence
to
swoop
down
towards
the
deep
into
which
they
plunged
their
beaks
in
search
of
food
such
incidents
and
scenes
as
these
were
infinite
in
their
variety
and
it
was
accordingly
only
for
minds
that
were
obtuse
to
the
charms
of
nature
that
the
voyage
could
be
monotonous
on
the
day
the
wind
shifted
weldon
was
walking
up
and
down
on
the
pilgrim
stern
when
her
attention
was
attracted
by
what
seemed
to
her
a
strange
phenomenon
all
of
a
sudden
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
sea
had
assumed
a
reddish
hue
as
if
it
were
tinged
with
blood
both
dick
and
jack
were
standing
close
behind
her
and
she
cried
look
dick
look
the
sea
is
all
red
is
it
a
that
is
making
the
water
so
strange
a
colour
no
answered
dick
it
is
not
a
weed
it
is
what
the
sailors
call
whales
food
it
is
formed
i
believe
of
innumerable
myriads
of
minute
crustacea
crustacea
they
may
be
replied
weldon
but
they
must
be
so
small
that
they
are
mere
insects
cousin
benedict
no
doubt
will
like
to
see
them
she
called
aloud
benedict
benedict
come
here
we
have
a
sight
here
to
interest
you
the
amateur
naturalist
slowly
emerged
from
his
cabin
followed
by
captain
hull
ah
yes
i
see
said
the
captain
whales
food
just
the
opportunity
for
you
benedict
a
chance
not
to
be
thrown
away
for
studying
one
of
the
most
curious
of
the
crustacea
nonsense
ejaculated
benedict
contemptuously
utter
nonsense
why
what
do
you
mean
mr
benedict
retorted
the
captain
surely
you
as
an
entomologist
must
know
that
i
am
right
in
my
conviction
that
these
crustacea
belong
to
one
of
the
six
classes
of
the
articulata
the
disdain
of
cousin
benedict
was
expressed
by
a
repeated
sneer
are
you
not
aware
sir
that
my
researches
as
an
entomologist
are
confined
entirely
to
the
hexapoda
captain
hull
unable
to
repress
a
smile
only
answered
i
see
sir
your
tastes
do
not
lie
in
the
same
direction
as
those
of
the
whale
and
turning
to
weldon
he
continued
to
whalemen
madam
this
is
a
sight
that
speaks
for
itself
it
is
a
token
that
we
ought
to
lose
no
time
in
getting
out
our
lines
and
looking
to
the
state
of
our
harpoons
there
is
game
not
far
away
jack
gave
vent
to
his
astonishment
do
you
mean
that
great
creatures
like
whales
feed
on
such
tiny
things
as
these
yes
my
boy
said
the
captain
and
i
daresay
they
are
as
nice
to
them
as
semolina
and
ground
rice
are
to
you
when
a
whale
gets
into
the
middle
of
them
he
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
open
his
jaws
and
in
a
minute
hundreds
of
thousands
of
these
minute
creatures
are
inside
the
fringe
or
whalebone
around
his
palate
and
he
is
sure
of
a
good
mouthful
so
you
see
jack
said
dick
the
whale
gets
his
shrimps
without
the
trouble
of
shelling
them
and
when
he
has
just
closed
his
snappers
is
the
very
time
to
give
him
a
good
taste
of
the
harpoon
added
captain
hull
the
words
had
hardly
escaped
the
captain
lips
when
a
shout
from
one
of
the
sailors
announced
a
whale
to
larboard
there
the
whale
repeated
the
captain
all
his
professional
instincts
were
aroused
in
an
instant
and
he
hurried
to
the
bow
followed
in
eager
curiosity
by
all
the
stern
passengers
even
cousin
benedict
loitered
up
in
the
rear
constrained
in
spite
of
himself
to
take
a
share
in
the
general
interest
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
matter
four
miles
or
so
to
windward
an
unusual
commotion
in
the
water
betokened
to
experienced
eyes
the
presence
of
a
whale
but
the
distance
was
too
great
to
permit
a
reasonable
conjecture
to
be
formed
as
to
which
species
of
those
mammifers
the
creature
belonged
three
distinct
species
are
familiarly
known
first
there
is
the
right
whale
which
is
ordinarily
sought
for
in
the
northern
fisheries
the
average
length
of
this
cetacean
is
sixty
feet
though
it
has
been
known
to
attain
the
length
of
eighty
feet
it
has
no
dorsal
fin
and
beneath
its
skin
is
a
thick
layer
of
blubber
one
of
these
monsters
alone
will
yield
as
much
as
a
hundred
barrels
of
oil
then
there
is
the
a
typical
representative
of
the
species
balænoptera
a
definition
which
may
at
first
sight
appear
to
possess
an
interest
for
an
entomologist
but
which
really
refers
to
two
white
dorsal
fins
each
half
as
wide
as
the
body
resembling
a
pair
of
wings
and
in
their
formation
similar
to
those
of
the
it
must
be
owned
however
that
a
flying
whale
would
decidedly
be
a
lastly
there
is
the
jubarte
commonly
known
as
the
finback
it
is
provided
with
a
dorsal
fin
and
in
length
not
unfrequently
is
a
match
for
the
gigantic
right
whale
while
it
was
impossible
to
decide
to
which
of
the
three
species
the
whale
in
the
distance
really
belonged
the
general
impression
inclined
to
the
belief
that
it
was
a
jubarte
with
longing
eyes
captain
hull
and
his
crew
gazed
at
the
object
of
general
attraction
just
as
irresistibly
as
it
is
said
a
clockmaker
is
drawn
on
to
examine
the
mechanism
of
every
clock
which
chance
may
throw
in
his
way
so
is
a
whaleman
ever
anxious
to
plunge
his
harpoon
into
any
whale
that
he
can
get
within
his
reach
the
larger
the
game
the
more
keen
the
excitement
and
no
eagerness
ever
surpasses
the
zest
of
the
when
once
started
in
pursuit
of
the
prey
to
the
crew
the
sight
of
the
whale
was
the
opening
of
an
unexpected
opportunity
and
no
wonder
they
were
fired
with
the
burning
hope
that
even
now
they
might
do
something
to
supply
the
deficiency
of
their
meagre
haul
throughout
the
season
far
away
as
the
creature
still
was
the
captain
practised
eye
soon
enabled
him
to
detect
various
indications
that
satisfied
him
as
to
its
true
species
amongst
other
things
that
arrested
his
attention
he
observed
a
column
of
water
and
vapour
ejected
from
the
nostrils
it
is
a
right
whale
he
said
if
so
its
spout
would
be
smaller
and
it
would
rise
higher
in
the
air
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
i
can
not
hear
the
roar
dick
tell
me
what
do
you
think
about
it
with
a
critical
eye
dick
sands
looked
long
and
steadily
at
the
spout
it
blows
out
water
sir
said
the
apprentice
water
as
well
as
vapour
i
should
think
it
is
a
finback
but
it
must
be
a
rare
large
one
seventy
feet
at
least
rejoined
the
captain
flushing
with
his
enthusiasm
what
a
big
fellow
said
jack
catching
the
excitement
of
his
elders
illustration
what
a
big
fellow
ah
jack
my
boy
chuckled
the
captain
the
whale
little
thinks
who
are
watching
him
enjoy
his
breakfast
yes
said
the
boatswain
a
dozen
such
gentlemen
as
that
would
freight
a
craft
twice
the
size
of
ours
but
this
one
if
only
we
can
get
him
will
go
a
good
way
towards
filling
our
empty
barrels
rather
rough
work

know
said
dick
to
attack
a
finback
you
are
right
dick
answered
the
captain
the
boat
has
yet
to
be
built
which
is
strong
enough
to
resist
the
flap
of
a
jubarte
tail
but
the
profit
is
worth
the
risk
captain
is
it
you
are
right
again
dick
replied
captain
hull
and
as
he
spoke
he
clambered
on
to
the
bowsprit
in
order
that
he
might
get
a
better
view
of
the
whale
the
crew
were
as
eager
as
their
captain
mounted
on
the
they
scanned
the
movements
of
their
coveted
prey
in
the
distance
freely
descanting
upon
the
profit
to
be
made
out
of
a
good
finback
and
declaring
that
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
if
this
chance
of
filling
the
casks
below
should
be
permitted
to
be
lost
captain
hull
was
perplexed
he
bit
his
nails
and
knitted
his
brow
mamma
cried
little
jack
i
should
so
much
like
to
see
a
whale
close
quite
close
you
know
and
so
you
shall
my
boy
replied
the
captain
who
was
standing
by
and
had
come
to
the
resolve
that
if
his
men
would
back
him
he
would
make
an
attempt
to
capture
the
prize
he
turned
to
his
crew
my
men
what
do
you
think
shall
we
make
the
venture
remember
we
are
all
alone
we
have
no
whalemen
to
help
us
we
must
rely
upon
ourselves
i
have
thrown
a
harpoon
before
now
i
can
throw
a
harpoon
again
what
do
you
say
the
crew
responded
with
a
ringing
cheer

preparations
for
an
attack
great
was
the
excitement
that
now
prevailed
and
the
question
of
an
attempt
to
capture
the
became
the
ruling
theme
of
conversation
weldon
expressed
considerable
doubt
as
to
the
prudence
of
venturing
upon
so
great
a
risk
with
such
a
limited
number
of
hands
but
when
captain
hull
assured
her
that
he
had
more
than
once
successfully
attacked
a
whale
with
a
single
boat
and
that
for
his
part
he
had
no
fear
of
failure
she
made
no
further
remonstrance
and
appeared
quite
satisfied
having
formed
his
resolve
the
captain
lost
no
time
in
setting
about
his
preliminary
arrangements
he
could
not
really
conceal
from
his
own
mind
that
the
pursuit
of
a
finback
was
always
a
matter
of
some
peril
and
he
was
anxious
accordingly
to
make
every
possible
provision
which
forethought
could
devise
against
all
emergencies
besides
her
which
was
kept
between
the
two
masts
the
pilgrim
had
three
two
of
them
slung
to
the
starboard
and
larboard
davits
and
the
third
at
the
stern
outside
the
taffrail
during
the
fishing
season
when
the
crew
was
reinforced
by
a
hired
complement
of
new
zealand
whalemen
all
three
of
these
boats
would
be
brought
at
once
into
requisition
but
at
present
the
whole
crew
of
the
pilgrim
was
barely
sufficient
to
man
one
of
the
three
boats
tom
and
his
friends
were
ready
to
volunteer
their
assistance
but
any
offers
of
service
from
them
were
necessarily
declined
the
manipulation
of
a
can
only
be
entrusted
to
those
who
are
experienced
in
the
work
as
a
false
turn
of
the
tiller
or
a
premature
stroke
of
the
oar
may
in
a
moment
compromise
the
safety
of
the
whole
party
thus
compelled
to
take
all
his
trained
sailors
with
him
on
his
venturous
expedition
the
captain
had
no
alternative
than
to
leave
his
apprentice
in
charge
of
the
schooner
during
his
absence
dick
choice
would
have
been
very
much
in
favour
of
taking
a
share
in
the
but
he
had
the
good
sense
to
know
that
the
developed
strength
of
a
man
would
be
of
far
greater
service
in
the
boat
and
accordingly
without
a
murmur
he
resigned
himself
to
remain
behind
of
the
five
sailors
who
were
to
man
the
boat
there
were
four
to
take
the
oars
whilst
howick
the
boatswain
was
to
manage
the
oar
at
the
stern
which
on
these
occasions
generally
replaces
an
ordinary
rudder
as
being
quicker
in
action
in
the
event
of
any
of
the
side
oars
being
disabled
the
post
of
harpooner
was
of
course
assigned
to
captain
hull
to
whose
lot
it
would
consequently
fall
first
to
hurl
his
weapon
at
the
whale
then
to
manage
the
unwinding
of
the
line
to
which
the
harpoon
was
attached
and
finally
to
kill
the
creature
by
when
it
should
emerge
again
from
below
the
sea
a
method
sometimes
employed
for
commencing
an
attack
is
to
place
a
sort
of
small
cannon
on
the
bows
or
deck
of
the
boat
and
to
discharge
from
it
either
a
harpoon
or
some
explosive
bullets
which
make
frightful
lacerations
on
the
body
of
the
victim
but
the
pilgrim
was
not
provided
with
apparatus
of
this
description
not
only
are
all
the
contrivances
of
this
kind
very
costly
and
difficult
to
manage
but
the
fishermen
generally
are
averse
to
innovations
and
prefer
the
harpoons
it
was
with
these
alone
that
captain
hull
was
now
about
to
encounter
the
finback
that
was
lying
some
four
miles
distant
from
his
ship
the
weather
promised
as
favourably
as
could
be
for
the
enterprise
the
sea
was
calm
and
the
wind
moreover
was
still
moderating
so
that
there
was
no
likelihood
of
the
schooner
drifting
away
during
the
absence
when
the
starboard
had
been
lowered
and
the
four
sailors
had
entered
it
howick
passed
a
couple
of
harpoons
down
to
them
and
some
lances
which
had
been
carefully
sharpened
to
these
were
added
five
coils
of
stout
and
supple
rope
each
feet
long
for
a
whale
when
struck
often
dives
so
deeply
that
even
these
lengths
of
line
knotted
together
are
found
to
be
insufficient
after
these
implements
of
attack
had
been
properly
stowed
in
the
bows
the
crew
had
only
to
await
the
pleasure
of
their
captain
the
pilgrim
before
the
sailors
left
her
had
been
made
to
heave
to
and
the
yards
were
braced
so
as
to
secure
her
remaining
as
stationary
as
possible
as
the
time
drew
near
for
the
captain
to
quit
her
he
gave
a
searching
look
all
round
to
satisfy
himself
that
everything
was
in
order
he
saw
that
the
halyards
were
properly
tightened
and
the
sails
trimmed
as
they
should
be
and
then
calling
the
young
apprentice
to
his
side
he
said
now
dick
i
am
going
to
leave
you
for
a
few
hours
while
i
am
away
i
hope
that
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
you
to
make
any
movement
whatever
however
you
must
be
on
the
watch
it
is
not
very
likely
but
it
is
possible
that
this
finback
may
carry
us
out
to
some
distance
if
so
you
will
have
to
follow
and
in
that
case
i
am
sure
you
may
rely
upon
tom
and
his
friends
for
assistance
one
and
all
the
negroes
assured
the
captain
of
their
willingness
to
obey
dick
instructions
the
sturdy
hercules
rolling
up
his
capacious
as
if
to
show
that
he
was
ready
for
immediate
action
the
captain
went
on
the
weather
is
beautifully
fine
dick
and
i
see
no
prospect
of
the
wind
freshening
but
come
what
may
i
have
one
direction
to
give
you
which
i
strictly
enforce
you
must
not
leave
the
ship
if
i
want
you
to
follow
us
i
will
hoist
a
flag
on
the
you
may
trust
me
sir
answered
dick
and
i
will
keep
a
good
all
right
my
lad
keep
a
cool
head
and
a
good
heart
you
are
second
captain
now
you
know
i
never
heard
of
any
one
of
your
age
being
placed
in
such
a
post
be
a
credit
to
your
position
dick
blushed
and
the
bright
flush
that
rose
to
his
cheeks
spoke
more
than
words
the
lad
may
be
trusted
murmured
the
captain
to
himself
he
is
as
modest
as
he
is
courageous
yes
he
may
be
trusted
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
captain
was
not
wholly
without
compunction
at
the
step
he
was
taking
he
was
aware
of
the
danger
to
which
he
was
exposing
himself
but
he
beguiled
himself
with
the
persuasion
that
it
was
only
for
a
few
hours
and
his
fisherman
instinct
was
very
keen
it
was
not
only
for
himself
the
desire
upon
the
part
of
the
crew
was
almost
irresistibly
strong
that
every
opportunity
ought
to
be
employed
for
making
the
cargo
of
the
schooner
equal
to
her
owner
expectations
and
so
he
finally
prepared
to
start
i
wish
you
all
success
said
weldon
many
thanks
he
replied
little
jack
put
in
his
word
and
you
will
try
and
catch
the
whale
without
hurting
him
much
all
right
young
gentleman
answered
the
captain
he
shall
hardly
feel
the
tip
of
our
fingers
sometimes
said
cousin
benedict
as
if
he
had
been
pondering
the
expedition
in
relation
to
his
pet
science
sometimes
there
are
strange
insects
clinging
to
the
backs
of
these
great
mammifers
do
you
think
you
are
likely
to
procure
me
any
specimens
you
shall
soon
have
the
opportunity
of
investigating
for
yourself
was
the
captain
reply
and
you
tom
we
shall
be
looking
to
you
for
help
in
cutting
up
our
prize
when
we
get
it
alongside
continued
he
we
shall
be
quite
ready
sir
said
the
negro
one
thing
more
dick
added
the
captain
you
may
as
well
be
getting
up
the
empty
barrels
out
of
the
hold
they
will
be
all
ready
it
shall
be
done
sir
answered
dick
promptly
if
everything
went
well
it
was
the
intention
that
the
whale
after
it
had
been
killed
should
be
towed
to
the
side
of
the
schooner
where
it
would
be
firmly
lashed
then
the
sailors
with
their
feet
in
spiked
shoes
would
get
upon
its
back
and
proceed
to
cut
the
blubber
from
head
to
tail
in
long
strips
which
would
first
be
divided
into
lumps
about
a
foot
and
a
half
square
the
lumps
being
subsequently
chopped
into
smaller
portions
capable
of
being
stored
away
in
casks
the
ordinary
rule
would
be
for
a
ship
as
soon
as
the
flaying
was
complete
to
make
its
way
to
land
where
the
blubber
could
be
at
once
boiled
down
an
operation
by
which
it
is
reduced
by
about
a
third
of
its
weight
and
by
which
it
yields
all
its
oil
the
only
portion
of
it
which
is
of
any
value
under
present
circumstances
however
captain
hull
would
not
think
of
melting
down
the
blubber
until
his
arrival
at
valparaiso
and
as
he
was
sanguine
that
the
wind
would
soon
set
in
a
favourable
direction
he
calculated
that
he
should
reach
that
port
in
less
than
three
weeks
a
period
during
which
his
cargo
would
not
be
deteriorated
the
latest
movement
with
regard
to
the
pilgrim
had
been
to
bring
her
somewhat
nearer
the
spot
where
the
spouts
of
vapour
indicated
the
presence
of
the
coveted
prize
the
creature
continued
to
swim
about
in
the
reddened
waters
opening
and
shutting
its
huge
jaws
like
an
automaton
and
absorbing
at
every
mouthful
whole
myriads
of
animalcula
no
one
entertained
a
fear
that
it
would
try
to
make
an
escape
it
was
the
unanimous
verdict
that
it
was
a
fighting
whale
and
one
that
would
resist
all
attacks
to
the
very
end
as
captain
hull
descended
the
and
took
his
place
in
the
front
of
the
boat
weldon
and
all
on
board
renewed
their
good
wishes
dingo
stood
with
his
fore
paws
upon
the
taffrail
and
appeared
as
much
as
any
to
be
bidding
the
adventurous
party
farewell
when
the
boat
pushed
off
those
who
were
left
on
board
the
pilgrim
made
their
way
slowly
to
the
bows
from
which
the
most
extensive
view
was
to
be
gained

i
must
get
you
to
keep
your

upon
that
man
ay
ay
sir
replied
the
apprentice
by
his
gestures
the
captain
showed
that
he
was
under
some
emotion
he
called
out
again
but
the
boat
had
made
such
headway
that
it
was
too
far
off
for
any
words
to
be
heard
dingo
broke
out
into
a
piteous
howl
the
dog
was
still
standing
erect
his
eye
upon
the
boat
in
the
distance
to
the
sailors
ever
superstitious
the
howling
was
not
reassuring
even
weldon
was
startled
why

she
exclaimed

sir
you

behave
better

shaking
his
head
solemnly

does
wag
his

at

bad
omen
all
at
once
the
dog
gave
a
savage
growl
as
she
turned
her
head
mrs
weldon
caught
sight
of
negoro
making
his
way
to
the
forecastle
probably
actuated
by
the
general
spirit
of
curiosity
to
follow
the
maneuvers
of

stopped
and
seized
a
handspike
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
ferocious
attitude
of
the
dog
the

was
quite
unable
to
pacify
the
animal
which
seemed
about
to
fly
upon
the
throat
of
the
cook
but
dick
sands
called
out
loudly
down
dingo
down
the
dog
obeyed
but
it
seemed
to
be
with
extreme
reluctance
that
he
returned
to
dick
side
he
continued
to
growl
as
if
still
remembering
his
rage
negoro
had
turned
very
pale
and
having
put
down
the
handspike
made
his
way
cautiously
back
to
his
own
quarters
hercules

answered
significantly
clenching

took
his
station
at

he
kept
an
earnest
watch
upon

chapter
viii
a
catastrophe
experienced
whaleman
as
he
was
captain
hull
knew
the
difficulty
of
the
task
he
had
undertaken
he
was
alive
to
the
importance
of
making
his
approach
to
the
whale
from
the
leeward
so
that
there
should
be
no
sound
to
apprize
the
creature
of
the
proximity
of
the
boat
he
had
perfect
confidence
in
his
boatswain
and
felt
sure
that
he
would
take
the
proper
course
to
insure
a
favourable
result
to
the
enterprise
we
must
show
ourselves
too
soon
howick
he
said
certainly
not
replied
howick
i
am
going
to
skirt
the
edge
of
the
discoloured
water
and
i
shall
take
good
care
to
get
well
to
leeward
all
right
the
captain
answered
and
turning
to
the
crew
said
now
my
lads
as
quietly
as
you
can
muffling
the
sound
of
their
oars
by
placing
straw
in
the
rowlocks
and
avoiding
the
least
unnecessary
noise
the
men
skilfully
propelled
the
boat
along
the
outline
of
the
water
tinged
by
the
crustacea
so
that
while
the
starboard
oars
still
dipped
in
the
green
and
limpid
sea
the
larboard
were
in
the
waves
and
seemed
as
though
they
were
dripping
with
blood
wine
on
this
side
water
on
that
said
one
of
the
sailors
jocosely
but
neither
of
them
fit
to
drink
rejoined
the
captain
sharply
so
just
hold
your
tongue
under
howick
guidance
the
boat
now
glided
stealthily
on
to
the
greasy
surface
of
the
reddened
waters
where
she
appeared
to
float
as
on
a
pool
of
oil
the
whale
seemed
utterly
unconscious
of
the
attack
that
was
threatening
it
and
allowed
the
boat
to
come
nearer
without
exhibiting
any
sign
of
alarm

the
whale
seemed
utterly
unconscious
of
the
attack
that
was
threatening
it
the
wide
circuit
which
the
captain
had
thought
it
advisable
to
take
had
the
effect
of
considerably
increasing
the
distance
between
his
boat
and
the
pilgrim
whilst
the
strange
rapidity
with
which
objects
at
sea
become
diminished
in
apparent
magnitude
as
if
viewed
through
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
made
the
ship
look
farther
away
than
she
actually
was
another
elapsed
and
at
the
end
of
it
the
captain
found
himself
so
exactly
to
leeward
that
the
huge
body
of
the
whale
was
precisely
intermediate
between
his
boat
and
the
pilgrim
a
closer
approach
must
now
be
made
every
precaution
must
be
used
but
the
time
had
come
to
get
sufficiently
near
for
the
harpoon
to
be
discharged
slowly
my
men
said
the
captain
in
a
low
voice
slowly
and
softly
howick
muttered
something
that
implied
that
the
whale
had
ceased
blowing
so
hard
and
that
it
was
aware
of
their
approach
the
captain
upon
this
enjoined
the
most
perfect
silence
but
urged
his
crew
onwards
until
in
five
or
six
minutes
they
were
within
a
length
of
the
finback
erect
at
the
stern
the
boatswain
stood
and
manoeuvred
to
get
the
boat
as
close
as
possible
to
the
whale
left
flank
while
he
made
it
an
object
of
special
care
to
keep
beyond
the
reach
of
its
formidable
tail
one
stroke
of
which
could
involve
them
all
in
instantaneous
disaster
the
manipulation
of
the
boat
thus
left
to
the
boatswain
the
captain
made
ready
for
the
arduous
effort
that
was
before
him
at
the
extreme
bow
harpoon
in
hand
with
his
legs
somewhat
astride
so
as
to
insure
his
equilibrium
he
stood
prepared
to
plunge
his
weapon
into
the
mass
that
rose
above
the
surface
of
the
sea
by
his
side
coiled
in
a
pail
and
with
one
end
firmly
attached
to
the
harpoon
was
the
first
of
the
five
lines
which
if
the
whale
should
dive
to
a
considerable
depth
would
have
to
be
joined
end
to
end
one
after
another
are
you
ready
my
lads
said
he
hardly
above
a
whisper
ay
ay
sir
replied
howick
speaking
as
gently
as
his
master
and
giving
a
firmer
grip
to
the
that
he
held
in
his
hands
then
alongside
at
once
was
the
captain
order
which
was
promptly
obeyed
so
that
in
a
few
minutes
the
boat
was
only
about
ten
feet
from
the
body
of
the
whale
the
animal
did
not
move
was
it
asleep
in
that
case
there
was
hope
that
the
very
first
stroke
might
be
fatal
but
it
was
hardly
likely
captain
hull
felt
only
too
sure
that
there
was
some
different
cause
to
be
assigned
for
its
remaining
so
still
and
stationary
and
the
rapid
glances
of
the
boatswain
showed
that
he
entertained
the
same
suspicion
but
it
was
no
time
for
speculation
the
moment
for
action
had
arrived
and
no
attempt
was
made
on
either
hand
to
exchange
ideas
upon
the
subject
captain
hull
seized
his
weapon
tightly
by
the
shaft
and
having
poised
it
several
times
in
the
air
in
order
to
make
more
sure
of
his
aim
he
gathered
all
his
strength
and
hurled
it
against
the
side
of
the
finback
backwater
he
shouted
the
sailors
pushed
back
with
all
their
might
and
the
boat
in
an
instant
was
beyond
the
range
of
the
creature
tail
and
now
the
immoveableness
of
the
animal
was
at
once
accounted
for
see
there
a
youngster
exclaimed
howick
and
he
was
not
mistaken
startled
by
the
blow
of
the
harpoon
the
monster
had
heeled
over
on
to
its
side
and
the
movement
revealed
a
young
whale
which
the
mother
had
been
disturbed
in
the
act
of
suckling
it
was
a
discovery
which
made
captain
hull
aware
that
the
capture
of
the
whale
would
be
attended
with
double
difficulty
he
knew
that
she
would
defend
her
little
one
if
such
a
term
can
be
applied
to
a
creature
that
was
at
least
twenty
feet
long
with
the
most
determined
fury
yet
having
made
what
he
considered
a
successful
commencement
of
the
attack
he
would
not
be
daunted
nor
deterred
from
his
endeavour
to
secure
so
fine
a
prize
the
whale
did
not
as
sometimes
happens
make
a
precipitate
dash
upon
the
boat
a
proceeding
which
necessitates
the
instant
cutting
of
the
and
an
immediate
retreat
but
it
took
the
far
more
usual
course
of
diving
downwards
almost
perpendicularly
it
was
followed
by
its
calf
very
soon
however
after
rising
once
again
to
the
surface
with
a
sudden
bound
it
began
swimming
along
under
water
with
great
rapidity
before
its
first
plunge
captain
hull
and
howick
had
sufficient
opportunity
to
observe
that
it
was
an
unusually
large
balaenoptera
measuring
at
least
eighty
feet
from
head
to
tail
its
colour
being
of
a
dappled
with
numerous
spots
of
a
darker
shade
the
pursuit
or
what
may
be
more
aptly
termed
the
towing
of
the
whale
had
now
fairly
commenced
the
sailors
had
shipped
their
oars
and
the
darted
like
an
arrow
along
the
surface
of
the
waves
in
spite
of
the
oscillation
which
was
very
violent
howick
succeeded
in
maintaining
equilibrium
and
did
not
need
the
repeated
injunctions
with
which
the
agitated
captain
urged
his
boatswain
to
be
upon
his
guard
but
fast
as
the
boat
flew
along
she
could
not
keep
pace
with
the
whale
and
so
rapidly
did
the
line
run
out
that
except
proper
care
had
been
taken
to
keep
the
bucket
in
which
it
was
coiled
filled
with
water
the
friction
against
the
edge
of
the
boat
would
inevitably
have
caused
it
to
take
fire
the
whale
gave
no
indication
of
moderating
its
speed
so
that
the
first
line
was
soon
exhausted
and
the
second
had
to
be
attached
to
its
end
only
to
be
run
out
with
like
rapidity
in
a
few
minutes
more
it
was
necessary
to
join
on
the
third
line
it
was
evident
that
the
whale
had
not
been
hit
in
a
vital
part
and
so
far
from
rising
to
the
surface
the
oblique
direction
of
the
rope
indicated
that
the
creature
was
seeking
yet
greater
depths
confound
it
exclaimed
the
captain
it
seems
as
if
the
brute
is
going
to
run
out
all
our
line
yes
and
see
what
a
distance
the
animal
is
dragging
us
away
from
the
answered
howick
sooner
or
later
however
said
captain
hull
the
thing
must
come
to
the
surface
she
is
not
a
fish
you
know
she
is
saving
her
breath
for
the
sake
of
her
speed
said
one
of
the
sailors
with
a
grin
but
grin
as
he
might
both
he
and
his
companions
began
to
look
serious
when
the
fourth
line
had
to
be
added
to
the
third
and
more
serious
still
when
the
fifth
was
added
to
the
fourth
the
captain
even
began
to
mutter
imprecations
upon
the
refractory
brute
that
was
putting
their
patience
to
so
severe
a
test
the
last
line
was
nearly
all
uncoiled
and
the
general
consternation
was
growing
very
great
when
there
was
observed
to
be
a
slight
slackening
in
the
tension
thank
heaven
cried
the
captain
the
beast
has
tired
herself
out
at
last
casting
his
eye
towards
the
pilgrim
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
she
could
not
be
less
than
five
miles
to
leeward
it
was
a
long
distance
but
when
according
to
his
arrangement
he
had
hoisted
the
flag
on
the
which
was
to
be
the
signal
for
the
ship
to
approach
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
that
dick
sands
and
the
negroes
at
once
began
bracing
the
yards
to
get
as
near
as
possible
to
the
wind
the
breeze
however
blew
only
in
short
unsteady
puffs
and
it
was
only
too
evident
that
the
pilgrim
would
have
considerable
difficulty
in
working
her
way
to
the
even
if
she
succeeded
at
last
meantime
just
as
had
been
expected
the
whale
had
risen
to
the
surface
of
the
water
the
harpoon
still
fixed
firmly
in
her
side
she
remained
motionless
apparently
waiting
for
her
calf
which
she
had
far
in
her
mad
career
captain
hull
ordered
his
men
to
pull
towards
her
as
rapidly
as
they
could
and
on
getting
close
up
two
of
the
sailors
following
the
captain
example
shipped
their
oars
and
took
up
the
long
lances
with
which
the
whale
was
now
to
be
attacked
howick
held
himself
in
readiness
to
sheer
off
quickly
in
the
event
of
the
finback
making
a
turn
towards
the
boat
now
my
lads
shouted
the
captain
look
out
take
a
good
aim
no
false
shots
are
you
ready
howick
quite
ready
captain
answered
the
boatswain
adding
but
it
perplexes
me
altogether
to
see
the
brute
so
quiet
all
of
a
sudden
it
looks
suspicious
said
the
captain
but
never
mind
go
on
straight
ahead
captain
hull
was
becoming
more
excited
every
moment
during
the
time
the
boat
was
approaching
the
whale
had
only
turned
round
a
little
in
the
water
without
changing
its
position
it
was
evidently
still
looking
for
its
calf
which
was
not
to
be
seen
by
its
side
all
of
a
sudden
it
gave
a
jerk
with
its
tail
which
carried
it
some
few
yards
away
the
men
were
all
excited
was
the
beast
going
to
escape
again
was
the
fatiguing
pursuit
all
to
come
over
a
second
time
must
not
the
chase
be
abandoned
would
not
the
prize
have
to
be
given
up
but
no
the
whale
was
not
starting
on
another
flight
it
had
merely
turned
so
as
to
face
the
boat
and
now
rapidly
beating
the
water
with
its
enormous
fins
it
commenced
a
frantic
dash
forwards
look
out
howick
she
coming
shouted
captain
hull
the
skilful
boatswain
was
all
on
the
alert
the
boat
swerved
as
if
by
instinct
so
as
to
avoid
the
blow
and
as
the
whale
passed
furiously
by
she
received
three
tremendous
thrusts
from
the
lances
of
the
captain
and
the
two
men
who
all
endeavoured
to
strike
at
some
vital
part
there
was
a
sudden
pause
the
whale
spouted
up
two
gigantic
columns
of
blood
and
water
lashed
its
tail
and
with
bounds
and
plunges
that
were
terrible
to
behold
renewed
its
angry
attack
upon
the
boat
none
but
the
most
determined
of
whalemen
could
fail
to
lose
their
head
under
such
an
assault
calm
and
collected
however
the
crew
remained
once
again
did
howick
adroitly
sheer
aside
and
once
again
did
the
three
lances
do
their
deadly
work
upon
the
huge
carcase
as
it
rolled
impetuously
past
but
this
time
so
great
was
the
wave
that
was
caused
by
the
infuriated
animal
that
the
boat
was
full
of
water
and
in
imminent
danger
of
being
capsized
bale
away
men
cried
the
captain
putting
down
their
oars
the
other
sailors
set
to
work
baling
with
all
their
might
captain
hull
cut
the
now
no
longer
required
because
the
whale
maddened
with
pain
and
grief
for
the
loss
of
its
offspring
would
certainly
make
no
further
attempt
to
escape
but
would
fight
desperately
to
the
very
end
the
finback
was
obviously
bent
on
a
third
onslaught
upon
the
boat
which
being
in
spite
of
all
the
men
exertions
still
more
than
half
full
of
water
no
longer
answered
readily
to
the
no
one
thought
of
flight
the
swiftest
boat
could
be
overtaken
in
a
very
few
bounds
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
face
the
encounter
it
was
not
long
in
coming
their
previous
good
fortune
failed
them
the
whale
in
passing
caught
the
boat
with
such
a
violent
blow
from
its
dorsal
fin
that
the
men
lost
their
footing
and
the
lances
missed
their
mark
where
howick
screamed
the
captain
in
alarm
here
i
am
captain
all
right
replied
the
boatswain
who
had
scrambled
to
his
feet
only
to
find
that
the
oar
with
which
he
had
been
steering
was
snapped
in
half
the
rudder
smashed
he
said
take
another
howick
quick
cried
the
captain
but
scarcely
had
he
time
to
replace
the
broken
oar
when
a
bubbling
was
heard
a
few
yards
away
from
the
boat
and
the
young
whale
made
its
appearance
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
catching
sight
of
it
instantly
the
mother
made
a
fresh
dash
in
its
direction
the
maternal
instincts
were
aroused
and
the
contest
must
become
more
deadly
than
ever
captain
hull
looked
towards
the
pilgrim
and
waved
his
signal
frantically
above
his
head
it
was
however
with
no
hope
of
succour
he
was
only
too
well
aware
that
no
human
efforts
could
effectually
hasten
the
arrival
of
the
ship
dick

indeed
had
at
once
obeyed
the
first
summons
already
the
wind
was
filling
the
sails
but
in
default
of
steam
power
her
progress
at
best
could
not
be
otherwise
than
slow
not
only
did
dick
feel
convinced
that
it
would
be
a
useless
waste
of
time
to
lower
a
boat
and
come
off
with
the
negroes
to
the
rescue
but
he
remembered
the
strict
orders
he
had
received
on
no
account
to
quit
the
ship
captain
hull
however
could
perceive
that
the
apprentice
had
had
the
lowered
and
was
towing
it
along
so
that
it
should
be
in
readiness
for
a
refuge
as
soon
as
they
should
get
within
reach
illustration
the
boat
was
well
nigh
full
of
water
and
in
imminent
danger
of
being
capsized
but
the
whale
close
at
hand
demanded
attention
that
could
ill
be
spared
for
the
yet
distant
ship
covering
her
young

with

body
she
was
manifestly
designing
another

sheer
off
bellowed
the
captain
but
the
order
was
useless
the
fresh
oar
that
the
boatswain
had
taken
to
replace

broken

was
considerably
shorter
and
consequently
it

been
heard
on

another
moment
and
from
beneath
there
came
a
tremendous
blow
from
the

sent
the

flying

promotion
the
first
feeling
experienced
by
those
on
board
the
pilgrim
after
witnessing
the
terrible
disaster
was
one
of
grief
and
horror
at
the
fearful
death
that
had
befallen
the
victims
captain
hull
and
his
men
had
been
swept
away
before
their
very
eyes
and
they
had
been
powerless
to
assist
not
one
was
saved
the
schooner
had
reached
the
spot
too
late
to
offer
the
least
resistance
to
the
attacks
of
the
formidable
when
dick
and
the
negroes
returned
to
the
ship
after
their
hopeless
search
with
only
the
corroboration
of
their
sad
foreboding
that
captain
and
crew
had
disappeared
for
ever
weldon
sank
upon
her
knees
little
jack
knelt
beside
her
crying
bitterly
and
dick
old
nan
and
all
the
negroes
stood
reverently
around
her
whilst
with
great
devoutness
the
lady
offered
up
the
prayer
of
commendation
for
the
souls
of
the
departing
all
sympathized
heartily
with
her
supplications
nor
was
there
any
diminution
of
their
fervour
when
she
proceeded
to
implore
that
the
survivors
might
have
strength
and
courage
for
their
own
hour
of
need
the
situation
was
indeed
very
grave
here
was
the
pilgrim
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
the
nearest
land
without
captain
without
crew
at
the
mercy
of
the
wind
and
waves
it
was
a
strange
fatality
that
had
brought
the
whale
across
their
path
it
was
a
fatality
stranger
still
that
had
induced
her
captain
a
man
of
no
ordinary
prudence
to
risk
even
his
life
for
the
sake
of
making
good
a
deficient
cargo
it
was
an
event
almost
unknown
in
the
annals
of
that
not
a
single
man
in
the
should
escape
alive
nevertheless
it
was
all
too
true
and
now
of
all
those
left
on
board
dick
sands
the
of
fifteen
years
of
age
was
the
sole
individual
who
had
the
slightest
knowledge
of
the
management
of
a
ship
the
negroes
brave
and
willing
as
they
were
were
perfectly
ignorant
of
seamen
duties
and
to
crown
all
here
was
a
lady
with
her
child
on
board
for
whose
safety
the
commander
of
the
vessel
would
be
held
responsible
such
were
the
facts
which
presented
themselves
to
the
mind
of
dick
as
with
folded
arms
he
stood
gazing
gloomily
at
the
spot
where
captain
hull
his
esteemed
benefactor
had
sunk
to
rise
no
more
the
lad
raised
his
eyes
sadly
he
scanned
the
horizon
with
the
vain
hope
that
he
might
perchance
descry
some
passing
vessel
to
which
he
could
confide
weldon
and
her
son
for
himself
his
mind
was
made
up
he
had
already
resolved
that
nothing
should
induce
him
to
quit
the
pilgrim
until
he
had
exhausted
every
energy
in
trying
to
carry
her
into
port
the
ocean
was
all
deserted
since
the
disappearance
of
the
whale
nothing
had
broken
the
monotonous
surface
either
of
sea
or
sky
the
apprentice
short
as
his
experience
was
knew
enough
to
be
aware
that
he
was
far
out
of
the
common
track
alike
of
merchantmen
or
whalers
he
would
not
buoy
himself
up
with
false
expectations
he
would
look
his
situation
full
and
fairly
in
the
face
he
would
do
his
best
and
trust
hopefully
in
guidance
from
the
power
above
thus
absorbed
in
his
meditations
he
did
not
observe
that
he
was
not
alone
negoro
who
had
gone
below
immediately
after
the
catastrophe
had
again
come
back
upon
deck
what
this
mysterious
character
had
felt
upon
witnessing
the
awful
calamity
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
although
with
his
eye
he
had
keenly
taken
in
every
detail
of
the
melancholy
spectacle
every
muscle
of
his
face
had
remained
unmoved
not
a
gesture
not
a
word
betrayed
the
least
emotion
even
if
he
had
heard
he
had
taken
no
part
nor
evinced
the
faintest
interest
in
weldon
outpouring
of
prayer
he
had
made
his
way
to
the
stern
where
dick
sands
was
pondering
over
the
responsibilities
of
his
own
position
and
stood
looking
towards
the
apprentice
without
interrupting
his
reverie
catching
sight
of
him
dick
roused
himself
in
an
instant
and
said
you
want
to
speak
to
me
i
must
speak
either
to
the
captain
or
the
boatswain
answered
the
man
negoro
said
dick
sharply
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
they
are
both
drowned
then
where
am
i
to
get
my
orders
from
asked
the
fellow
insolently
from
me
promptly
rejoined
the
apprentice
from
you
from
a
boy
of
fifteen
yes
from
me
repeated
dick
in
a
firm
and
resolute
voice
looking
at
the
man
until
he
recoiled
under
his
gaze
from
weldon
had
heard
what
passed
i
wish
every
one
on
board
to
understand
she
interposed
that
dick
sands
is
captain
now
orders
must
be
taken
from
him
and
they
must
be
obeyed
negoro
frowned
bit
his
lip
sneered
and
having
muttered
something
that
was
unintelligible
made
his
way
back
to
his
cabin
meantime
the
schooner
under
the
freshening
breeze
had
been
carried
beyond
the
shoal
of
the
crustaceans
dick
cast
his
eye
first
at
the
sails
then
along
the
deck
and
seemed
to
become
more
and
more
alive
to
the
weight
of
the
obligation
that
had
fallen
upon
him
but
his
heart
did
not
fail
him
he
was
conscious
that
the
hopes
of
the
passengers
centred
in
himself
and
he
was
determined
to
let
them
see
that
he
would
do
his
best
not
to
disappoint
them
although
he
was
satisfied
of
his
capability
with
the
help
of
the
negroes
to
manipulate
the
sails
he
was
conscious
of
a
defect
of
the
scientific
knowledge
which
was
requisite
for
properly
controlling
the
ship
course
he
felt
the
want
of
a
few
more
years
experience
if
only
he
had
had
longer
practice
he
would
he
thought
have
been
as
able
as
captain
hull
himself
to
use
the
sextant
to
take
the
altitude
of
the
stars
to
read
the
time
from
his
chronometer
sun
moon
and
planets
should
have
been
his
guides
from
the
firmament
as
from
a
he
would
have
gathered
the
teachings
of
his
true
position
but
all
this
was
beyond
him
as
yet
his
knowledge
went
no
further
than
the
use
of
the
log
and
compass
and
by
these
alone
he
must
be
content
to
make
his
reckonings
but
he
kept
up
his
courage
and
did
not
permit
himself
for
one
moment
to
despair
of
ultimate
success
weldon
needed
little
penetration
to
recognize
the
thoughts
which
were
passing
in
the
mind
of
the
resolute
youth
i
see
you
have
come
to
your
decision
dick
she
said
the
command
of
the
ship
is
in
your
hands
no
fear
but
that
you
will
do
your
duty
and
tom
and
the
rest
of
them
no
doubt
will
render
you
every
assistance
in
their
power
yes
weldon
rejoined
dick
brightly
and
before
long
i
shall
hope
to
make
them
good
seamen
if
only
the
weather
lasts
fair
everything
will
go
on
well
enough
and
if
the
weather
turns
out
bad
we
must
not
despond
we
will
get
safe
ashore
he
paused
a
moment
and
added
reverently
god
helping
us
weldon
proceeded
to
inquire
whether
he
had
any
means
of
ascertaining
the
pilgrim
present
position
he
replied
that
the
ship
chart
would
at
once
settle
that
captain
hull
had
kept
the
reckoning
accurately
right
up
to
the
preceding
day
and
what
do
you
propose
to
do
next
she
asked
of
course
you
understand
that
in
our
present
circumstances
we
are
not
in
the
least
bound
to
go
to
valparaiso
if
there
is
a
nearer
port
which
we
could
reach
certainly
not
replied
dick
and
therefore
it
is
my
intention
to
sail
due
east
as
by
following
that
course
we
are
sure
to
come
upon
some
part
of
the
american
coast
illustration
oh
we
shall
soon
be
on
shore
do
your
best
dick
to
let
us
get
ashore
somewhere
never
fear
madam
he
answered
as
we
get
nearer
land
we
shall
be
almost
sure
to
fall
in
with
a
cruiser
which
will
put
us
into
the
right
track
if
the
wind
does
but
remain
in
the
and
allow
us
to
carry
plenty
of
sail
we
shall
get
on
famously
he
spoke
with
the
cheery
confidence
of
a
good
sailor
who
knows
the
good
ship
beneath
his
feet
he
had
moved
off
a
few
steps
to
go
and
take
the
helm
when
weldon
calling
him
back
reminded
him
that
he
had
not
yet
ascertained
the
true
position
of
the
schooner
dick
confessed
that
it
ought
to
be
done
at
once
and
going
to
the
captain
cabin
brought
out
the
chart
upon
which
the
commander
had
marked
the
bearings
the
evening
before
according
to
this
they
were
in
lat
and
long
and
as
the
schooner
had
made
next
to
no
progress
during
the
last
eventful
hours
the
entry
might
fairly
be
accepted
as
representing
approximately
their
present
position
to
the
lady
inexperienced
eye
as
she
bent
over
the
outspread
chart
it
seemed
that
the
land
as
represented
by
the
brown
patch
which
depicted
the
continent
of
south
america
extending
like
a
barrier
between
two
oceans
from
cape
horn
to
columbia
was
after
all
not
so
very
far
distant
the
wide
space
of
the
pacific
was
not
so
broad
but
that
it
would
be
quickly
traversed
oh
we
shall
soon
be
on
shore
she
said
but
dick
knew
better
he
had
acquaintance
enough
with
the
scale
upon
which
the
chart
was
constructed
to
be
aware
that
the
pilgrim
herself
would
have
been
a
speck
like
a
microscopic
infusoria
on
the
vast
surface
of
that
sea
and
that
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
weary
miles
separated
her
from
the
coast
no
time
was
to
be
lost
contrary
winds
had
ceased
to
blow
a
fresh
breeze
had
sprung
up
and
the
or
overhead
indicated
that
for
some
time
at
least
the
direction
of
the
wind
would
be
unchanged
dick
appealed
to
the
negroes
and
tried
to
make
them
appreciate
the
difficulty
of
the
task
that
had
fallen
to
his
lot
tom
answered
in
behalf
of
himself
and
all
the
rest
that
they
were
not
only
willing
but
anxious
to
do
all
they
could
to
assist
him
saying
that
if
their
knowledge
was
small
yet
their
arms
were
strong
and
added
that
they
should
certainly
be
obedient
to
every
order
he
gave
my
friends
said
dick
addressing
them
in
reply
i
shall
make
it
a
point
of
myself
taking
the
helm
as
much
as
possible
but
you
know
i
must
have
my
proper
rest
sometimes
no
one
can
live
without
sleep
now
tom
i
intend
you
to
stand
by
me
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
i
will
try
and
make
you
understand
how
to
steer
by
the
aid
of
the
compass
it
is
not
difficult
you
will
soon
learn
i
shall
have
to
leave
you
when
i
go
to
my
hammock
for
an
hour
or
two
is
there
nothing
said
little
jack
that
i
can
learn
to
do
oh
yes
jack
you
shall
keep
the
wind
in
order
answered
dick
smiling
that
i
will
cried
the
child
clapping
his
hands
while
the
mother
drew
him
to
her
side
and
now
my
men
was
dick
first
order
to
his
crew
we
must
brace
in
the
yards
to
sail
fair
i
will
show
you
how
all
right
captain
sands
we
are
at
your
service
said
old
tom
gravely

oh
yes

chapter
x
the
new
crew
dick
sands
captain
of
the
pilgrim
would
not
lose
a
moment
in
getting
his
ship
under
sail
his
prime
object
was
to
land
his
passengers
safely
at
valparaiso
or
some
other
american
port
and
to
accomplish
his
purpose
it
was
in
the
first
place
necessary
that
he
should
ascertain
the
schooner
rate
of
speed
and
the
direction
that
she
was
taking
this
information
was
to
be
obtained
readily
enough
by
means
of
the
log
and
compass
and
the
result
of
each
day
observations
would
be
entered
regularly
on
the
chart
the
log
on
board
was
a
patent
log
with
a
and
screw
by
means
of
which
the
distance
that
is
travelled
can
be
measured
accurately
for
any
definite
time
it
was
an
instrument
so
simple
that
the
negroes
were
very
soon
taught
its
use
the
slight
error
in
the
reckoning
caused
by
the
action
of
the
currents
could
only
be
rectified
by
astronomical
observations
which
as
already
has
been
stated
were
beyond
dick
attainments
to
make
the
idea
more
than
once
crossed
dick
mind
whether
he
would
not
take
the
pilgrim
back
again
to
new
zealand
the
distance
was
considerably
less
than
it
was
to
america
and
had
the
wind
remained
in
the
quarter
whence
it
had
been
blowing
so
long
it
is
more
than
likely
he
would
have
determined
to
retrace
his
course
but
as
the
wind
had
now
veered
to
the
and
there
was
every
probability
that
it
was
settled
for
a
time
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
better
take
advantage
of
it
and
persevere
in
making
his
way
towards
the
east
accordingly
he
lost
no
time
in
putting
his
ship
before
the
wind
on
a
schooner
the
usually
carries
four
square
sails
on
the
lower
mast
a
on
the
a
on
the
a
and
a
royal
the
carries
only
a
and
a
between
the
masts
upon
the
can
be
hoisted
a
triple
tier
of
triangular
sails
while
the
bowsprit
with
its
will
carry
the
three
jibs
the
jibs
the
the
and
the
staysails
are
all
managed
with
comparative
ease
because
they
can
be
hoisted
from
the
deck
without
the
necessity
of
ascending
the
mast
to
let
fly
the
robbins
by
which
they
are
fastened
to
the
yards
with
the
sails
on
the
it
is
altogether
a
more
difficult
business
in
order
either
to
unfurl
them
to
take
them
in
or
to
reef
them
it
is
necessary
for
a
man
to
clamber
up
by
the
shrouds
either
to
the
or
to
the
and
thence
mounting
by
loose
ropes
extended
below
the
yards
to
hold
on
by
one
hand
whilst
he
does
his
work
with
the
other
the
operation
requires
alike
the
head
and
arm
of
an
experienced
mariner
and
when
a
fresh
breeze
has
been
blowing
it
is
a
casualty
far
from
uncommon
that
a
sailor
confused
by
the
flapping
of
the
canvas
and
the
pitching
of
the
vessel
should
be
blown
overboard
in
the
act
for
the
unpractised
negroes
the
danger
would
necessarily
be
very
great
however
the
wind
at
present
was
very
moderate
and
the
ship
ploughed
her
way
over
the
waves
without
any
violent
oscillations
at
the
time
when
dick
sands
in
obedience
to
the
signal
he
received
from
captain
hull
proceeded
to
make
his
way
to
the
scene
of
the
disaster
the
pilgrim
as
she
lay
to
was
carrying
only
her
jibs
and
in
order
therefore
to
put
her
as
near
as
possible
to
the
wind
it
had
been
merely
necessary
to
the
yard
a
manoeuvre
in
which
the
negroes
had
rendered
all
the
assistance
that
was
necessary
it
was
requisite
now
to
do
something
more
to
enable
him
to
get
straight
before
the
wind
dick
wanted
to
increase
his
sail
and
was
desirous
of
hoisting
the
the
royal
the
and
the
he
was
himself
standing
at
the
wheel
now
my
men
he
shouted
to
the
negroes
i
want
your
help
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
bear
away
tom
tom
looked
puzzled
bear
away
unfasten
that
rope
i
mean
and
bat
come
along
do
the
same
as
tom
the
men
did
what
they
were
bidden
that
right
continued
dick
and
calling
to
hercules
said
now
hercules
a
good
strong
pull
to
give
such
a
direction
to
hercules
was
somewhat
imprudent
the
rigging
creaked
again
under
his
giant
strength
gently
gently
my
good
fellow
said
dick
laughing
you
will
have
the
mast
down
i
declare
i
hardly
touched
the
rope
answered
hercules
well
next
time
you
must
only
pretend
to
touch
it
said
dick
and
continuing
his
orders
shouted
now
slacken
let
fly
make
fast
now
brace
in
the
yards
all
right
that
capital
the
yards
were
loosened
the
foresails
turned
slowly
round
and
catching
the
breeze
gave
a
slight
impetus
to
the
ship
dick
next
orders
were
for
the
to
be
set
free
and
then
he
called
the
men
to
the
stern
now
said
he
we
must
look
to
the
but
take
care
hercules
not
to
have
it
down
i
will
be
as
careful
as
possible
dick
submissively
replied
hercules
as
though
he
were
afraid
to
commit
himself
to
any
rash
promise
the
manoeuvre
was
simple
enough
the
was
gradually
slackened
the
great
sail
took
the
wind
and
added
its
powerful
action
to
that
of
the
the
was
next
brought
to
bear
it
was
only
clewed
up
so
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
except
to
pull
the
halyards
haul
it
aboard
the
tack
and
unfurl
it
but
in
pulling
at
the
halyards
the
muscular
energy
of
hercules
which
was
supplemented
by
that
of
actæon
not
to
forget
little
jack
who
had
volunteered
his
assistance
proved
to
be
overpowering
and
the
rope
snapped
in
two
all
three
of
them
of
course
fell
flat
upon
the
deck
but
fortunately
neither
of
them
was
hurt
and
jack
laughed
heartily
at
his
tumble
as
an
excellent
joke
up
with
you
cried
captain
dick
there
no
harm
done
splice
the
rope
and
haul
away
more
gently
next
time
it
took
but
a
few
minutes
to
execute
the
order
and
the
pilgrim
was
soon
sailing
away
rapidly
with
her
head
to
the
east
well
done
my
friends
said
dick
who
had
not
left
his
post
at
the
helm
you
will
be
sailors
before
the
end
of
the
voyage
we
shall
do
our
best
i
promise
you
captain
sands
replied
tom
making
it
a
point
to
give
the
young
commander
his
proper
title
weldon
also
congratulated
the
new
crew
upon
the
success
of
their
first
attempt
i
believe
it
was
master
jack
who
broke
that
rope
said
hercules
with
a
sly
twinkle
in
his
eye
he
is
very
strong
i
can
tell
you
jack
looked
as
though
he
thoroughly
appreciated
the
compliment
and
evidenced
his
satisfaction
by
giving
his
huge
friend
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
there
were
still
several
sails
that
were
not
yet
set
running
well
before
the
wind
as
the
pilgrim
was
dick
nevertheless
felt
that
the
gallant
royal
and
if
brought
into
service
would
materially
assist
her
progress
and
he
determined
not
to
dispense
with
their
help
the
could
be
hoisted
from
below
but
to
bring
the
gallant
and
royal
into
play
demanded
more
experience
than
any
of
his
crew
had
had
knowing
that
he
could
not
entrust
the
task
to
them
and
yet
resolved
not
to
be
baulked
of
his
wish
to
set
them
he
undertook
the
task
himself
he
first
put
tom
to
the
helm
showing
him
how
to
keep
the
schooner
head
in
the
right
direction
and
having
placed
the
other
four
at
the
royal
and
halyards
proceeded
to
mount
the
foremast
illustration
all
three
of
them
fell
flat
upon
the
deck
to
clamber
up
the
foreshrouds
and
the
on
to
the
was
mere
child
play
to
the
active
apprentice
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
unfurled
the
mounted
to
the
unfurled
the
royal
again
reached
the
and
having
caught
hold
of
one
of
the
starboard
backstays
had
descended
to
the
deck
there
he
gave
the
necessary
directions
and
the
two
sails
were
made
fast
and
both
yards
braced
nor
did
this
content
him
the
were
set
between
the
masts
and
thus
the
pilgrim
was
running
along
crowded
to
the
full
with
all
her
canvas
the
only
additional
sails
which
dick
could
possibly
have
employed
would
have
been
some
to
larboard
but
as
the
setting
of
these
was
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
and
they
were
not
always
readily
struck
in
the
case
of
a
sudden
squall
he
contented
himself
without
them
again
he
took
his
place
at
the
helm
the
breeze
was
manifestly
freshening
and
the
pilgrim
almost
imperceptibly
heeling
to
starboard
glided
rapidly
along
the
surface
of
the
water
leaving
behind
her
a
wake
smooth
and
clean
that
bore
plain
witness
to
the
true
adjustment
of
her
this
is
good
progress
weldon
he
said
may
heaven
grant
the
wind
and
weather
may
continue
thus
favourable
the
lady
in
silence
shook
the
boy
hand
and
then
with
the
excitement
of
the
past
hours
went
to
her
cabin
where
she
lay
down
and
fell
into
a
troubled
doze
the
new
crew
remained
on
watch
they
were
stationed
on
the
forecastle
in
readiness
to
make
any
alteration
which
the
sails
might
require
but
the
wind
was
so
steady
and
unshifting
that
no
need
arose
for
their
services
and
cousin
benedict
all
this
time
where
was
he
and
what
had
he
been
doing
he
was
sitting
in
his
cabin
he
had
a
in
his
hand
and
was
studying
an
articulata
of
the
order
orthoptera
an
insect
of
the
blattidae
family
its
characteristics
are
a
roundish
body
rather
long
wings
flat
elytra
and
a
head
hidden
by
the
prothorax
he
had
been
on
deck
at
the
time
of
the
calamity
the
captain
with
the
crew
had
been
drowned
before
his
very
eyes
but
he
said
nothing
not
that
he
was
unmoved
to
think
that
he
was
not
struck
with
horror
would
be
to
libel
his
kind
and
pitying
nature
his
sympathy
was
aroused
especially
for
his
cousin
he
pressed
her
hand
warmly
as
if
he
would
assure
her
of
his
truest
commiseration
but
he
said
nothing
he
hurried
off
towards
his
cabin
and
who
shall
deny
that
it
was
to
devise
some
wonderfully
energetic
measures
that
he
would
take
in
consequence
of
this
melancholy
event
passing
the
kitchen
however
he
caught
sight
of
negoro
in
the
act
of
crushing
a
blatta
an
american
species
of
cockroach
he
broke
out
into
a
storm
of
invective
and
in
tones
of
indignation
demanded
the
surrender
of
the
insect
which
negoro
made
with
cool
contempt
in
a
moment
captain
hull
and
his
partners
in
death
were
all
forgotten
the
enthusiast
had
secured
a
prize
with
which
he
hastened
to
his
own
little
compartment
where
he
was
soon
absorbed
in
proving
to
his
own
satisfaction
in
opposition
to
the
opinion
of
other
entomologists
that
the
blattae
of
the
phoraspous
species
which
are
remarkable
for
their
colours
differ
in
their
habits
from
blattae
of
the
ordinary
sort
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
perfect
order
reigned
on
board
the
pilgrim
though
they
were
unable
to
shake
off
the
sickening
feeling
of
horror
roused
by
the
frightful
disaster
and
felt
that
they
had
sustained
a
startling
shock
all
the
passengers
seemed
mechanically
to
fall
into
their
usual
routine
dick
sands
though
avowedly
at
the
wheel
seemed
to
be
everywhere
with
an
eye
for
every
thing
and
his
amateur
crew
obeyed
him
readily
and
with
the
promptness
of
a
willing
activity
negoro
made
no
further
overt
attempt
to
question
the
young
authority
but
remained
shut
up
in
his
kitchen
dick
made
no
secret
of
his
determination
to
place
the
cook
in
close
confinement
if
he
exhibited
any
future
sign
of
insubordination
hercules
was
ready
to
carry
him
off
bodily
to
the
hold
and
old
nan
was
equally
ready
to
take
his
place
in
the
cooking
department
probably
negoro
was
aware
of
all
this
at
any
rate
he
did
not
seem
disposed
to
give
any
further
cause
of
offence
at
present
illustration
jack
evidenced
his
satisfaction
by
giving
his
huge
friend
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
as
the
day
advanced
the
wind
continued
to
freshen
but
no
shifting
of
the
sails
seemed
necessary
the
pilgrim
was
running
well
there
was
no
need
to
diminish
her
spread
of
canvas
masts
as
solid
and
rigging
as
strong
as
hers
could
stand
a
far
heavier
breeze
as
a
general
rule
it
is
deemed
prudent
in
case
of
a
squall
to
shorten
sail
at
night
and
especially
to
take
in
gallants
and
royal
but
the
weather
prospects
now
were
all
so
promising
and
satisfactory
that
dick
persuaded
himself
he
was
under
no
necessity
to
take
this
precaution
he
rather
felt
himself
bound
to
take
the
strongest
measures
he
could
to
expedite
his
reaching
less
unfrequented
waters
he
made
up
his
mind
however
not
to
leave
the
deck
at
all
that
night
the
young
captain
made
every
effort
to
get
an
approximate
reckoning
of
the
schooner
progress
he
heaved
the
log
every
and
duly
registered
the
result
of
each
successive
examination
there
were
two
compasses
on
board
one
in
the
binnacle
close
under
the
eye
of
the
helmsman
the
other
an
inverted
compass
being
attached
to
the
rafters
of
the
captain
cabin
so
that
without
leaving
his
berth
he
could
see
whether
the
man
in
charge
of
the
wheel
was
holding
a
proper
course
every
vessel
that
is
duly
furnished
for
a
lengthened
voyage
has
always
not
only
two
compasses
but
two
chronometers
one
to
correct
the
other
the
pilgrim
was
not
deficient
in
this
respect
and
dick
sands
made
a
strong
point
of
admonishing
his
crew
that
they
should
take
especial
care
of
the
compasses
which
under
their
present
circumstances
were
of
such
supreme
importance
a
misfortune
however
was
in
store
for
them
on
the
night
of
the
while
dick
was
on
watch
the
compass
in
the
cabin
became
detached
from
its
fastening
and
fell
on
the
floor
the
accident
was
not
discovered
until
the
following
morning
whether
the
metal
ferule
that
had
attached
the
instrument
to
the
rafters
had
become
rusty
or
whether
it
had
been
worn
away
by
additional
friction
it
seemed
impossible
to
settle
all
that
could
be
said
was
that
the
compass
was
broken
beyond
repair
dick
was
extremely
grieved
at
the
loss
but
he
did
not
consider
that
any
one
was
to
be
blamed
for
the
mishap
and
could
only
resolve
for
the
future
to
take
extra
care
of
the
compass
in
the
binnacle
with
the
exception
of
this
everything
appeared
to
go
on
satisfactorily
on
board
weldon
reassured
by
dick
confidence
had
regained
much
of
her
wonted
calmness
and
was
besides
ever
supported
by
a
sincere
religious
spirit
she
and
dick
had
many
a
long
conversation
together
the
ingenuous
lad
was
always
ready
to
take
the
kind
and
intelligent
lady
into
his
counsel
and
day
by
day
would
point
out
to
her
on
the
chart
the
registers
he
made
as
the
result
of
his
dead
reckoning
he
would
then
try
and
satisfy
her
that
under
the
prevailing
wind
there
could
be
no
doubt
they
must
arrive
at
the
coast
of
south
america
moreover
he
said
that
unless
he
was
much
mistaken
they
should
sight
the
land
at
no
great
distance
from
valparaiso
weldon
had
in
truth
no
reason
to
question
the
correctness
of
dick
representations
she
owned
that
provided
the
wind
remained
in
the
same
favourable
quarter
there
was
every
prospect
of
their
reaching
land
in
safety
nevertheless
at
times
she
could
not
resist
the
misgiving
that
would
arise
when
she
contemplated
what
might
be
the
result
of
a
change
of
wind
or
a
breaking
of
the
weather
with
the
that
belonged
to
his
age
jack
soon
fell
back
into
his
accustomed
pursuits
and
was
to
be
seen
merrily
running
over
the
deck
or
romping
with
dingo
at
times
it
is
true
he
missed
the
companionship
of
dick
but
his
mother
made
him
comprehend
that
now
that
dick
was
captain
his
time
was
too
much
occupied
to
allow
him
any
leisure
for
play
and
the
child
quite
understood
that
he
must
not
interrupt
his
old
friend
in
his
new
duties
illustration
a
light
shadow
glided
stealthily
along
the
deck
the
negroes
performed
their
work
with
intelligence
and
seemed
to
make
rapid
progress
in
the
art
of
seamanship
tom
had
been
unanimously
appointed
boatswain
and
took
one
watch
with
bat
and
austin
the
alternate
watch
being
discharged
by
dick
himself
with
hercules
and
actæon
one
of
them
steered
so
that
the
other
two
were
free
to
watch
at
the
bows
as
a
general
rule
dick
sands
managed
to
remain
at
the
wheel
all
night
five
or
six
hours
sleep
in
the
daytime
sufficed
for
him
and
during
the
time
when
he
was
lying
down
he
entrusted
the
wheel
to
tom
or
bat
who
under
his
instructions
had
become
very
fair
helmsmen
although
in
these
unfrequented
waters
there
was
little
chance
of
running
foul
of
any
other
vessel
dick
invariably
took
the
precaution
of
lighting
his
signals
carrying
a
green
light
to
starboard
and
a
red
light
to
port
his
exertions
however
were
a
great
strain
upon
him
and
sometimes
during
the
night
his
fatigue
would
induce
a
heavy
drowsiness
and
he
steered
as
it
were
by
instinct
more
than
by
attention
on
the
night
of
the
he
was
so
utterly
that
he
was
obliged
to
ask
tom
to
relieve
him
at
the
helm
whilst
he
went
down
for
a
few
hours
rest
actæon
and
hercules
remained
on
watch
on
the
forecastle
the
night
was
very
dark
the
sky
was
covered
with
heavy
clouds
that
had
formed
in
the
chill
evening
air
and
the
sails
on
the
were
lost
in
the
obscurity
at
the
stern
the
lamps
on
either
side
of
the
binnacle
cast
a
faint
reflection
on
the
metal
mountings
of
the
wheel
leaving
the
deck
generally
in
complete
darkness
towards
three
in
the
morning
tom
was
getting
so
heavy
with
sleepiness
that
he
was
almost
unconscious
his
eye
long
fixed
steadily
on
the
compass
lost
its
power
of
vision
and
he
fell
into
a
doze
from
which
it
would
require
more
than
a
slight
disturbance
to
arouse
him
meantime
a
light
shadow
glided
stealthily
along
the
deck
creeping
gradually
up
to
the
binnacle
negoro
put
down
something
heavy
that
he
had
brought
in
his
hand
he
stole
a
keen
and
rapid
glance
at
the
dial
of
the
compass
and
made
his
way
back
unseen
and
unheard
as
he
had
come
almost
immediately
afterwards
tom
awakened
from
his
slumber
his
eye
fell
instinctively
on
the
compass
and
he
saw
in
a
moment
that
the
ship
was
out
of
her
proper
course
by
a
turn
of
the
helm
he
brought
her
head
to
what
he
supposed
to
be
the
east
but
he
was
mistaken
during
his
brief
interval
of
unconsciousness
a
piece
of
iron
had
been
deposited
beneath
the
magnetic
needle
which
by
this
means
had
been
diverted
thirty
degrees
to
the
right
and
instead
of
pointing
due
north
inclined
far
towards
consequently
it
came
to
pass
that
the
pilgrim
supposed
by
her
young
commander
to
be
making
good
headway
due
east
was
in
reality
under
the
brisk
breeze
speeding
along
towards
the
chapter
xi
rough
weather
during
the
ensuing
week
nothing
particular
occurred
on
board
the
breeze
still
freshened
and
the
pilgrim
made
on
the
average
miles
every
hours
the
speed
was
as
great
as
could
be
expected
from
a
craft
of
her
size
dick
grew
more
and
more
sanguine
in
his
anticipations
that
it
could
not
be
long
before
the
schooner
would
cross
the
track
of
the
plying
between
the
eastern
and
western
hemispheres
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
hail
the
first
passing
vessel
and
either
to
transfer
his
passengers
or
what
perhaps
would
be
better
still
to
borrow
a
few
sailors
and
it
might
be
an
officer
to
work
the
pilgrim
to
shore
he
could
not
help
however
a
growing
sense
of
astonishment
when
day
after
day
passed
and
yet
there
was
no
ship
to
be
signalled
he
kept
the
most
vigourous
but
all
to
no
purpose
three
voyages
before
had
he
made
to
the
and
his
experience
made
him
sure
that
he
ought
now
to
be
sighting
some
english
or
american
vessel
on
its
way
between
the
equator
and
cape
horn
very
different
however
was
the
true
position
of
the
pilgrim
from
what
dick
supposed
not
only
had
the
ship
been
carried
far
out
of
her
direct
course
by
currents
the
force
of
which
there
were
no
means
of
estimating
but
from
the
moment
when
the
compass
had
been
tampered
with
by
negoro
the
steering
itself
had
put
the
vessel
all
astray
unconscious
of
both
these
elements
of
disturbance
dick
sands
was
convinced
that
they
were
proceeding
steadily
eastwards
and
was
perpetually
encouraging
weldon
and
himself
by
the
assurance
that
they
must
very
soon
arrive
within
view
of
the
american
coast
again
and
again
asserting
that
his
sole
concern
was
for
his
passengers
and
that
for
his
own
safety
he
had
no
anxiety
but
think
dick
said
the
lady
what
a
position
you
would
have
been
in
if
you
had
not
had
your
passengers
you
would
have
been
alone
with
that
terrible
negoro
you
would
have
been
rather
alarmed
then
i
should
have
taken
good
care
to
put
it
out
of
negoro
power
to
do
me
any
mischief
and
then
i
should
have
worked
the
ship
by
myself
answered
the
lad
stoutly
his
very
pluck
gave
weldon
renewed
confidence
she
was
a
woman
with
wonderful
powers
of
endurance
and
it
was
only
when
she
thought
of
her
little
son
that
she
had
any
feeling
of
despair
yet
even
this
she
endeavoured
to
conceal
and
dick
undaunted
courage
helped
her
although
the
youth
of
the
apprentice
did
not
allow
him
to
pretend
to
any
advanced
scientific
knowledge
he
had
the
proverbial
of
the
sailor
he
was
not
only
very
keen
in
noticing
any
change
in
the
aspect
of
the
sky
but
he
had
learnt
from
captain
hull
who
was
a
clever
meteorologist
to
draw
correct
conclusions
from
the
indications
of
the
barometer
the
captain
indeed
having
taken
the
trouble
to
make
him
learn
by
heart
the
general
rules
which
are
laid
down
in
vorepierre
there
are
seven
of
these
rules
if
after
a
long
period
of
fine
weather
the
barometer
falls
suddenly
and
continuously
although
the
mercury
may
be
descending
for
two
or
three
days
before
there
is
an
apparent
change
in
the
atmosphere
there
will
ultimately
be
rain
and
the
longer
has
been
the
time
between
the
first
depression
and
the
commencement
of
the
rain
the
longer
the

may
be

if
after
a
long
period
of

weather
the
barometer

will
ensue
and
the

but
if
there
be
a
fall
immediately
on
the

it
will
not

this
rule
holds
also
conversely
in

and
autumn
a
sudden
fall

rain
in
the
summer
if
very
hot
it
foretells
a
storm

frost
a
fall
prognosticates
a
change
of

rain
and
hail
whilst
a
rise
announces
the
approach
of
snow
rapid
oscillations
of
the
mercury

way
are
not
to
be
interpreted
as
indicating
either
wet
or
dry
weather
of
any
duration
continuance
of
either
fair
or
foul
weather
is
forecast
only
by
a
prolonged
and
steady
rise
or
fall
beforehand
at
the
end
of
autumn
after
a
period
of
wind
and
rain
a
rise
may
be
expected
to
be
followed
by
north
wind
and
frost
not
merely
had
dick
got
these
rules
by
rote
but
he
had
tested
them
by
his
own
observations
and
had
become
singularly
trustworthy
in
his
forecasts
of
the
weather
he
made
a
point
of
consulting
the
barometer
several
times
every
day
and
although
to
all
appearances
the
sky
indicated
that
the
fine
weather
was
settled
it
did
not
escape
his
observation
that
on
the
the
mercury
showed
a
tendency
to
fall
dick
knew
that
rain
if
it
came
would
be
accompanied
by
wind
an
opinion
in
which
he
was
very
soon
confirmed
by
the
breeze
freshening
till
the
air
was
displaced
at
the
rate
of
nearly
sixty
feet
a
second
or
more
than
forty
miles
an
hour
and
he
recognized
the
necessity
of
at
once
shortening
sail
he
had
already
used
the
precaution
to
take
in
the
royal
the
and
the
flying
jib
but
he
now
at
once
resolved
likewise
to
take
in
the
and
to
have
a
couple
of
reefs
in
the
footnote
this
and
several
of
the
other
rules
are
concisely
concentrated
in
the
couplet
long
foretold
long
last
short
notice
soon
past
to
an
inexperienced
crew
the
last
operation
was
far
from
easy
but
there
was
no
symptom
of
shrinking
from
it
followed
by
bat
and
austin
dick
mounted
the
rigging
of
the
foremast
and
with
little
trouble
got
to
the
had
the
weather
been
less
unpromising
he
would
have
been
inclined
to
leave
the
two
yards
as
they
were
but
anticipating
the
ultimate
necessity
of
being
obliged
to
lower
the
mast
he
unrigged
them
and
let
them
down
to
the
deck
he
knew
well
enough
that
in
the
event
of
the
gale
rising
as
he
expected
the
lowering
of
the
mast
as
well
as
the
shortening
of
sail
would
contribute
to
diminish
the
strain
and
stress
upon
the
vessel
it
was
the
work
of
two
hours
to
get
this
preliminary
operation
over
there
still
remained
the
task
of
taking
in
the
reefs
in
the
the
pilgrim
in
one
respect
differed
from
most
modern
vessels
she
did
not
carry
a
double
foretop
which
would
very
much
have
diminished
the
difficulty
attending
the
reefing
it
was
consequently
necessary
to
proceed
as
before
to
mount
the
rigging
by
main
force
to
haul
in
the
flapping
canvas
and
to
make
the
fastening
secure
but
critical
and
dangerous
as
the
task
was
it
was
successfully
accomplished
and
the
three
young
men
having
descended
safely
to
the
deck
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
schooner
run
easily
before
the
wind
which
had
further
increased
till
it
was
blowing
a
stiff
gale
for
three
days
the
gale
continued
brisk
and
hard
yet
without
any
variation
in
its
direction
but
all
along
the
barometer
was
falling
the
mercury
sank
to
without
symptom
of
recovery
the
sky
was
becoming
overcast
clouds
thick
and
lowering
obscured
the
sun
and
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
where
it
rose
or
where
it
set
dick
did
his
best
to
keep
up
his
courage
but
he
could
not
disguise
from
himself
that
there
was
cause
for
uneasiness
he
took
no
more
rest
than
was
absolutely
necessary
and
what
repose
he
allowed
himself
he
always
took
on
deck
he
maintained
a
calm
exterior
but
he
was
really
tortured
with
anxiety
illustration
for
half
an
hour
negoro
stood
motionless
although
the
violence
of
the
wind
seemed
to
lull
awhile
dick
did
not
suffer
himself
to
be
betrayed
into
any
false
security
he
knew
only
too
well
what
to
expect
and
after
a
brief
interval
of
comparative
quiet
the
gale
returned
and
the
waves
began
to
run
very
high
about
four
one
afternoon
negoro
a
most
unusual
thing
for
him
emerged
from
his
kitchen
and
skulked
to
the
fore
dingo
was
fast
asleep
and
did
not
make
his
ordinary
growl
by
way
of
greeting
to
his
enemy
for
half
an
hour
negoro
stood
motionless
apparently
surveying
the
horizon
the
heavy
waves
rolled
past
they
were
higher
than
the
condition
of
the
wind
warranted
their
magnitude
witnessed
to
a
storm
passing
in
the
west
and
there
was
every
reason
to
suspect
that
the
pilgrim
might
be
caught
by
its
violence
negoro
looked
long
at
the
water
he
then
raised
his
eyes
and
scanned
the
sky
above
and
below
he
might
have
read
threatening
signs
the
upper
stratum
of
cloud
was
travelling
far
more
rapidly
than
that
beneath
an
indication
that
ere
long
the
masses
of
vapour
would
descend
and
coming
in
contact
with
the
inferior
current
would
change
the
gale
into
a
tempest
which
probably
would
increase
to
a
hurricane
it
might
be
from
ignorance
or
it
might
be
from
indifference
but
there
was
no
indication
of
alarm
on
the
face
of
negoro
on
the
other
hand
there
might
be
seen
a
sort
of
smile
curling
on
his
lip
after
thus
gazing
above
him
and
around
him
he
clambered
on
to
the
bowsprit
and
made
his
way
by
degrees
to
the
very
gammonings
again
he
rested
and
looked
about
him
as
if
to
explore
the
horizon
after
a
while
he
clambered
back
on
deck
and
soon
stealthily
retreated
to
his
own
quarters
no
doubt
there
was
much
to
cause
concern
in
the
general
aspect
of
the
weather
but
there
was
one
point
on
which
they
never
failed
to
congratulate
each
other
that
the
direction
of
the
wind
had
never
changed
and
consequently
must
be
carrying
them
in
the
desired
course
unless
a
storm
should
overtake
them
they
could
continue
their
present
navigation
without
peril
and
with
every
prospect
of
finding
a
port
upon
the
shore
where
they
might
put
in
such
were
their
mutual
and
acknowledged
hopes
but
dick
secretly
felt
the
misgiving
lest
without
a
pilot
he
might
in
his
ignorance
fail
to
find
a
harbour
of
refuge
nevertheless
he
would
not
suffer
himself
to
meet
trouble
and
kept
up
his
spirits
under
the
conviction
that
if
difficulties
came
he
should
be
strengthened
to
grapple
with
them
or
make
his
escape
time
passed
on
and
the
of
march
arrived
without
material
change
in
the
condition
of
the
atmosphere
the
sky
remained
heavily
burdened
and
the
wind
which
occasionally
had
abated
for
a
few
hours
had
always
returned
with
at
least
its
former
violence
the
occasional
rising
of
the
mercury
never
encouraged
dick
to
anticipate
a
permanent
improvement
in
the
weather
and
he
discerned
only
too
plainly
that
brighter
times
at
present
were
not
to
be
looked
for
a
startling
alarm
had
more
than
once
been
caused
by
the
sudden
breaking
of
storms
in
which
thunderbolts
had
seemed
to
fall
within
a
few
lengths
of
the
schooner
on
these
occasions
the
torrents
of
rain
had
been
so
heavy
that
the
ship
had
appeared
to
be
in
the
very
midst
of
a
whirlpool
of
vapour
and
it
was
impossible
to
see
a
yard
ahead
the
pilgrim
pitched
and
rolled
frightfully
fortunately
weldon
could
bear
the
motion
without
much
personal
inconvenience
and
consequently
was
able
to
devote
her
attention
to
her
little
boy
who
was
a
miserable
sufferer
cousin
benedict
was
as
undisturbed
as
the
cockroaches
he
was
investigating
he
hardly
noticed
the
increasing
madness
of
either
wind
or
wave
but
went
on
with
his
studies
as
calmly
as
if
he
were
in
his
own
comfortable
museum
at
san
francisco
moreover
it
was
fortunate
that
the
negroes
did
not
suffer
to
any
great
degree
from
and
consequently
were
able
to
assist
their
captain
in
his
arduous
task
dick
was
far
too
experienced
a
sailor
himself
to
be
inconvenienced
by
any
oscillations
of
the
vessel
however
violent
the
pilgrim
still
made
good
headway
and
dick
although
he
was
aware
that
ultimately
it
would
probably
be
necessary
again
to
shorten
sail
was
anxious
to
postpone
making
any
alteration
before
he
was
absolutely
obliged
surely
he
reasoned
with
himself
the
land
could
not
now
be
far
away
he
had
calculated
his
speed
he
had
kept
a
diligent
reckoning
on
the
chart
surely
the
shore
must
be
almost
in
sight
he
would
not
trust
his
crew
to
keep
watch
he
was
aware
how
easily
their
inexperienced
eyes
would
be
misled
and
how
they
might
mistake
a
distant
for
the
land
they
coveted
to
see
he
kept
watch
for
himself
his
own
gaze
was
ever
fixed
upon
the
horizon
and
in
the
eagerness
of
his
expectation
he
would
repeatedly
mount
to
the
to
get
a
wider
range
of
vision
but
land
was
not
to
be
seen
next
day
as
dick
was
standing
at
the
bow
alternately
considering
the
canvas
which
his
ship
carried
and
the
aspect
presented
by
the
sky
weldon
approached
him
without
his
noticing
her
she
caught
some
muttered
expressions
of
bewilderment
that
fell
from
his
lips
and
asked
him
whether
he
could
see
anything
he
lowered
the
telescope
which
he
had
been
holding
in
his
hand
and
answered
no
weldon
i
can
not
see
anything
and
it
is
this
hiat
perplexes
me
so
sorely
i
can
not
understand
why
we
have
not
already
come
in
sight
of
land
it
is
nearly
a
month
since
we
lost
our
poor
dear
captain
there
has
been
no
delay
in
our
progress
no
stoppage
in
our
rate
of
speed
i
can
not
make
it
out
how
far
were
we
from
land
when
we
lost
the
captain
i
am
sure
i
am
not
far
out
in
saying
that
we
were
scarcely
more
than
miles
from
the
shores
of
america
and
at
what
rate
have
we
been
sailing
not
much
less
than
nine
score
knots
a
day
how
long
then
do
you
reckon
dick
we
ought
to
be
in
arriving
at
the
coast
under
days
replied
dick
he
paused
before
he
spoke
again
then
added
but
what
mystifies
me
even
more
than
our
failing
to
sight
the
land
is
this
we
have
not
come
across
a
single
vessel
and
yet
vessels
without
number
are
always
traversing
these
seas
but
do
you
not
think
inquired
weldon
that
you
have
made
some
error
in
your
reckoning
is
your
speed
really
what
you
have
supposed
impossible
madam
replied
dick
with
an
air
of
dignity
impossible
that
i
should
have
fallen
into
error
the
log
has
been
consulted
without
fail
every
i
am
about
to
have
it
lowered
now
and
i
will
undertake
to
show
you
that
we
are
at
this
present
moment
making
ten
miles
an
hour
which
would
give
considerably
over
miles
a
day
he
then
called
out
to
tom
tom
lower
the
log
the
old
man
was
quite
accustomed
to
the
duty
the
log
was
fastened
to
the
line
and
thrown
overboard
it
ran
out
regularly
for
about
fathoms
when
all
at
once
the
line
slackened
in
hand
it
is
broken
cried
tom
the
cord
is
broken
broken
exclaimed
dick
good
heavens
we
have
lost
the
log
it
was
too
true
the
log
was
gone
tom
drew
in
the
rope
dick
took
it
up
and
examined
it
it
had
not
broken
at
its
point
of
union
with
the
log
it
had
given
way
in
the
middle
at
a
place
where
the
strands
in
some
unaccountable
way
had
worn
strangely
thin
dick
agony
of
mind
in
spite
of
his
effort
to
be
calm
was
intensely
great
a
suspicion
of
foul
play
involuntarily
occurred
to
him
he
knew
that
the
rope
had
been
of
make
he
knew
that
it
had
been
quite
sound
when
used
before
but
he
could
prove
nothing
he
could
only
mourn
over
the
loss
which
committed
him
to
the
sole
remaining
compass
as
his
only
guide
that
compass
too
although
he
knew
it
not
was
misleading
him
entirely
weldon
sighed
as
she
witnessed
the
grief
which
the
loss
manifestly
caused
poor
dick
but
in
purest
sympathy
she
said
nothing
and
retired
thoughtfully
to
her
cabin
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
reckon
the
rate
of
progress
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
pilgrim
continued
to
maintain
at
least
her
previous
speed
before
another
hours
had
passed
the
barometer
had
fallen
still
lower
and
the
wind
was
threatening
to
rise
to
a
velocity
of
sixty
miles
resolved
to
be
on
the
safe
side
dick
determined
not
only
to
strike
the
and
the
but
to
take
in
all
the
lower
sails
indeed
he
began
to
be
aware
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
the
operation
would
not
be
done
in
a
moment
and
the
storm
was
approaching
dick
made
tom
take
the
helm
he
ascended
the
shrouds
with
bat
austin
and
actæon
making
hercules
stay
on
deck
to
slacken
the
halyards
as
required
by
dint
of
arduous
exertion
and
at
no
little
risk
of
being
thrown
overboard
by
the
rolling
of
the
ship
they
succeeded
in
lowering
the
two
masts
the
was
then
reefed
and
the
entirely
struck
so
that
the
only
canvas
that
the
schooner
carried
was
the
reefed
and
the
one
stay
these
however
made
her
run
with
a
terrific
speed
early
on
the
morning
of
the
dick
noted
with
alarm
that
the
barometer
had
not
ceased
to
fall
and
now
registered
only
the
tempest
had
continued
to
increase
till
it
was
unsafe
for
the
ship
to
carry
any
canvas
at
all
the
order
was
given
for
the
to
be
taken
in
but
it
was
too
late
a
violent
gust
carried
the
sail
completely
away
and
austin
who
had
made
his
way
to
the
was
struck
by
the
flying
sheet
and
although
he
was
not
seriously
hurt
he
was
obliged
at
once
to
return
to
deck
dick
sands
became
more
uneasy
than
ever
he
was
tortured
by
apprehensions
of
reefs
outlying
the
shore
to
which
he
imagined
he
must
now
be
close
but
he
could
discern
no
rocks
to
justify
his
fears
and
returned
to
take
his
place
at
the
helm
the
next
moment
negoro
appeared
on
deck
he
pointed
mysteriously
to
the
horizon
as
though
he
discerned
some
object
as
a
mountain
there
and
looking
round
with
a
malevolent
smile
immediately
left
the
deck
and
went
back
to
his
cabin
illustration
under
bare
poles
chapter
xii
hope
revived
the
wind
had
now
increased
to
a
hurricane
it
had
veered
to
the
and
had
attained
a
velocity
little
short
of
ninety
miles
an
hour
on
land
the
most
substantial
of
erections
could
with
difficulty
have
withstood
its
violence
and
a
vessel
anchored
in
a
roadstead
must
have
been
torn
from
its
moorings
and
cast
ashore
the
memorable
storm
that
had
devastated
the
island
of
guadaloupe
on
the
of
july
when
heavy
cannon
were
lifted
from
their
carriages
could
scarcely
have
been
more
furious
and
it
was
only
her
mobility
before
the
blast
and
the
solidity
of
her
structure
that
gave
the
pilgrim
a
hope
of
surviving
the
tempest
a
few
minutes
after
the
topsail
had
been
lost
the
small
jib
was
carried
away
dick
sands
contemplated
the
possibility
of
throwing
out
a
made
of
extra
strong
canvas
as
a
means
of
bringing
the
ship
a
little
more
under
his
control
but
abandoned
the
idea
as
useless
it
was
therefore
under
bare
poles
that
the
pilgrim
was
driven
along
but
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
canvas
the
hull
masts
and
rigging
gave
sufficient
purchase
to
the
wind
and
the
progress
of
the
schooner
was
prodigiously
rapid
sometimes
indeed
she
seemed
to
be
literally
lifted
from
the
water
and
scudded
on
scarcely
skimming
its
surface
the
rolling
was
fearful
enormous
waves
followed
in
quick
succession
and
as
they
travelled
faster
than
the
ship
there
was
the
perpetual
risk
of
one
of
them
catching
her
astern
without
sail
there
were
no
means
of
escaping
that
peril
by
increase
of
speed
the
adroit
management
of
the
helm
was
the
only
chance
of
avoiding
the
hazardous
shocks
and
even
this
repeatedly
failed
to
prevent
his
being
washed
overboard
dick
lashed
himself
to
his
place
at
the
wheel
by
a
rope
round
his
waist
and
made
tom
and
bat
keep
close
at
hand
ready
to
give
him
assistance
in
case
of
emergency
hercules
and
actæon
clinging
to
the
bitt
kept
watch
at
the
bow
weldon
and
her
party
at
dick
special
request
remained
inside
the
stern
cabin
although
the
lady
for
her
own
part
would
much
rather
have
stayed
on
deck
she
had
however
yielded
to
the
representation
that
she
would
thus
be
exposing
herself
to
unnecessary
danger
the
hatchways
were
hermetically
closed
and
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
they
would
withstand
the
heavy
sea
that
was
dashing
over
them
only
let
one
of
them
give
way
to
the
pressure
and
the
vessel
must
inevitably
fill
and
founder
it
was
a
matter
of
congratulation
that
the
stowage
had
been
done
very
carefully
so
that
notwithstanding
all
the
lurchings
of
the
ship
the
cargo
did
not
shift
in
the
least
the
heroic
young
commander
had
still
further
curtailed
his
periods
of
rest
and
it
was
only
at
the
urgent
entreaty
of
weldon
who
feared
that
he
would
exhaust
himself
by
his
vigilance
that
he
was
induced
to
lie
down
for
a
few
hours
sleep
on
the
night
of
the
after
tom
and
bat
had
been
left
alone
at
the
wheel
they
were
somewhat
to
their
surprise
joined
by
negoro
who
very
rarely
came
aft
he
seemed
inclined
to
enter
into
conversation
but
found
little
encouragement
to
talk
on
the
part
either
of
tom
or
his
son
all
at
once
a
violent
roll
of
the
ship
threw
him
off
his
feet
and
he
would
have
gone
overboard
if
he
had
not
been
saved
by
falling
against
the
binnacle
old
tom
was
in
a
frantic
state
of
alarm
lest
the
compass
should
be
broken
he
uttered
a
cry
of
consternation
so
loud
that
it
roused
dick
from
the
light
slumber
into
which
he
had
fallen
in
the
cabin
and
he
rushed
to
the
deck
by
the
time
he
had
reached
the
stern
negoro
had
not
only
regained
his
feet
but
had
managed
successfully
to
conceal
the
bit
of
iron
which
he
had
again
extracted
from
beneath
the
binnacle
where
he
had
himself
laid
it
now
that
the
wind
had
shifted
to
the
it
suited
his
machinations
that
the
magnetic
needle
should
indicate
its
true
direction
illustration
quick
as
lightning
dick
sands
drew
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
how
now
asked
dick
eagerly
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
noise
tom
explained
how
the
cook
had
fallen
against
the
binnacle
and
how
he
had
been
terrified
lest
the
compass
should
be
injured
dick
heart
sank
at
the
thought
of
losing
his
sole
remaining
compass
and
his
anxiety
betrayed
itself
in
his
countenance
as
he
knelt
down
to
examine
its
condition
but
he
breathed
freely
as
he
ascertained
that
the
instrument
had
sustained
no
damage
by
the
dim
light
he
saw
the
needle
resting
on
its
two
concentric
circles
and
felt
his
fears
at
once
relieved
of
course
he
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
the
removal
of
the
bit
of
iron
had
made
the
magnet
change
its
pointing
the
incident
however
excited
his
misgiving
although
he
felt
that
negoro
could
not
be
held
responsible
for
an
accidental
fall
the
very
presence
of
the
man
in
such
a
place
at
such
a
time
perplexed
him
and
what
brings
you
here
this
hour
of
the
night
he
asked
that
not
your
business
retorted
negoro
insolently
it
is
my
business
replied
dick
resolutely
and
i
mean
to
have
an
answer
what
brought
you
here
negoro
answered
sullenly
that
he
knew
of
no
rule
to
prevent
his
going
where
he
liked
and
when
he
liked
no
rule
cried
dick
then
i
make
the
rule
now
from
this
time
forward
i
make
the
rule
that
you
shall
never
come
astern
do
you
understand
roused
from
his
accustomed
doggedness
the
man
seemed
to
make
a
threatening
movement
quick
as
lightning
dick
sands
drew
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
negoro
one
act
one
word
of
insubordination
and
i
blow
out
your
brains
negoro
had
no
time
to
reply
before
he
could
speak
he
was
bowed
down
towards
the
deck
by
an
irresistible
weight
hercules
had
grasped
him
by
the
shoulder
shall
i
put
him
overboard
captain
he
will
make
a
meal
for
the
fishes
they
are
not
very
particular
what
they
eat
said
the
negro
with
a
grin
of
contempt
not
yet
quietly
answered
dick
the
giant
removed
his
hand
and
negoro
stood
upright
again
and
began
to
retreat
to
his
own
quarters
muttering
however
as
he
passed
hercules
you
cursed
nigger
you
shall
pay
for
this
the
discovery
was
now
made
that
the
wind
apparently
had
taken
a
sudden
shift
of
no
less
than
degrees
but
what
occasioned
dick
the
greatest
perplexity
was
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
condition
of
the
sea
to
correspond
with
the
alteration
in
the
current
of
the
air
instead
of
being
directly
astern
wind
and
waves
were
now
beating
on
the
larboard
progress
in
this
way
must
necessarily
be
full
of
danger
and
dick
was
obliged
to
bring
his
ship
up
at
least
four
points
before
he
got
her
straight
before
the
tempest
the
young
captain
felt
that
he
must
be
more
than
ever
on
the
alert
he
could
not
shake
off
the
suspicion
that
negoro
had
been
concerned
in
the
loss
of
the
first
compass
and
had
some
further
designs
upon
the
second
still
he
was
utterly
at
a
loss
to
imagine
what
possible
motive
the
man
could
have
for
so
criminal
an
act
of
malevolence
as
there
was
no
plausible
reason
to
be
assigned
why
he
should
not
be
as
anxious
as
all
the
rest
to
reach
the
coast
of
america
the
suspicion
continued
however
to
haunt
him
and
when
he
mentioned
it
to
weldon
he
found
that
a
similar
feeling
of
distrust
had
agitated
her
although
she
like
himself
was
altogether
unable
to
allege
a
likely
motive
why
the
cook
should
contemplate
so
strange
an
act
of
mischief
it
was
determined
that
a
strict
surveillance
should
be
kept
upon
all
the
movements
negoro
however
manifested
no
inclination
to
disobey
the
peremptory
order
he
kept
strictly
to
his
own
part
of
the
ship
but
as
dingo
was
now
regularly
quartered
on
the
stern
there
was
a
tolerably
sure
guarantee
that
the
cook
would
not
be
found
wandering
much
in
that
direction
a
week
passed
and
still
the
tempest
showed
no
signs
of
abating
the
barometer
continued
to
fall
and
not
once
did
a
period
of
calmer
weather
afford
an
opportunity
of
carrying
sail
the
pilgrim
still
made
her
way
northeast
her
speed
could
not
be
less
than
two
hundred
miles
in
hours
but
no
land
appeared
vast
as
was
the
range
of
the
american
continent
extending
for
degrees
between
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
it
was
nowhere
to
be
discerned
was
he
dreaming
was
he
mad
dick
would
perpetually
ask
himself
had
he
been
sailing
in
a
wrong
direction
had
he
failed
to
steer
aright
but
no
he
was
convinced
there
was
no
error
in
his
steering
although
he
could
not
actually
see
it
for
the
mist
he
knew
that
day
after
day
the
sun
rose
before
him
and
that
it
set
behind
him
yet
he
was
constrained
in
bewilderment
to
ask
what
had
become
of
those
shores
of
america
upon
which
when
they
came
in
sight
there
was
only
too
great
a
fear
the
ship
should
be
dashed
what
had
become
of
them
where
were
they
whither
had
this
incessant
hurricane
driven
them
why
did
not
the
expected
coast
appear
to
all
these
bewildering
inquiries
dick
could
find
no
answer
except
to
imagine
that
his
compass
had
misled
him
yet
he
was
powerless
to
put
his
own
misgivings
to
the
test
he
deplored
more
than
ever
the
destruction
of
the
duplicate
instrument
which
would
have
checked
his
registers
he
studied
his
chart
but
all
in
vain
the
position
in
which
he
found
himself
as
the
result
of
negoro
treachery
seemed
to
baffle
him
the
more
the
more
he
tried
to
solve
the
mystery
the
days
were
passing
on
in
this
chronic
state
of
anxiety
when
one
morning
about
eight
hercules
who
was
on
watch
at
the
fore
suddenly
shouted
land
dick
sands
had
little
reliance
upon
the
negro
inexperienced
eye
but
hurried
forward
to
the
bow
where
the
land
he
cried
his
voice
being
scarcely
audible
above
the
howling
of
the
tempest
there
look
there
said
hercules
nodding
his
head
and
pointing
over
the
larboard
side
to
the
dick
could
see
nothing
weldon
had
heard
the
shout
unable
to
restrain
her
interest
she
had
left
her
cabin
and
was
at
dick
side
he
uttered
an
expression
of
surprise
at
seeing
her
but
could
not
hear
anything
she
said
as
her
voice
was
unable
to
rise
above
the
roaring
of
the
elements
she
stood
her
whole
being
as
it
were
concentrated
in
the
power
of
vision
and
scanned
the
horizon
in
the
direction
indicated
by
hercules
but
all
to
no
purpose
suddenly
however
after
a
while
dick
raised
his
hand
yes
he
said
yes
sure
enough
yonder
is
land
he
clung
with
excitement
to
the
netting
and
mrs
weldon
supported
by
hercules
strained
her
eyes
yet
more
vehemently
to
get
a
glimpse
of
a
shore
which
she
had
begun
to
despair
of
ever
reaching
beyond
a
doubt
an
elevated
peak
was
there
it
must
be
about
ten
miles
to
leeward
a
break
in
the
clouds
soon
left
it
more
distinct
some
promontory
it
must
be
upon
the
american
coast
without
sails
of
course
the
pilgrim
had
no
chance
of
bearing
down
direct
upon
it
but
at
least
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
she
would
soon
reach
some
other
portion
of
the
shore
perhaps
before
noon
certainly
in
a
few
hours
they
must
be
close
to
land
the
pitching
of
the
ship
made
it
impossible
for
weldon
to
keep
safe
footing
on
the
deck
accordingly
at
a
sign
from
dick
hercules
led
her
back
again
to
her
cabin
dick
did
not
remain
long
at
the
bow
but
went
thoughtfully
back
to
the
wheel
he
had
indeed
a
tremendous
responsibility
before
him
here
was
the
land
the
land
for
which
they
had
longed
so
eagerly
and
now
that
their
anticipations
were
on
the
point
of
being
realized
what
was
there
with
a
hurricane
driving
them
on
towards
it
to
prevent
that
land
being
their
destruction
what
measures
could
he
take
to
prevent
the
schooner
being
dashed
to
pieces
against
it
illustration
there
look
there
at
the
very
moment
when
the
promontory
was
just
abreast
of
them
negoro
appeared
on
deck
he
nodded
to
the
peak
familiarly
as
he
might
have
saluted
a
familiar
friend
and
retired
as
stealthily
as
he
had
come
two
hours
later
and
the
promontory
was
lying
to
the
larboard
wake
dick
sands
had
never
relaxed
his
watchfulness
but
he
had
failed
to
discover
any
further
indications
of
a
his
perplexity
could
only
increase
the
horizon
was
clear
the
andes
ought
to
be
distinct
they
would
be
conspicuous
twenty
miles
or
more
away
dick
took
up
his
telescope
again
and
again
he
scrutinized
the
eastern
horizon
with
minutest
care
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
and
as
the
afternoon
waned
away
the
last
glimpse
had
been
taken
of
the
promontory
that
had
awakened
their
expectation
it
had
vanished
utterly
from
their
gaze
no
indication
of
shore
could
be
seen
from
the
pilgrim
deck
dick
sands
uttered
a
sigh
of
mingled
amazement
and
relief
he
went
into
weldon
cabin
where
she
was
standing
with
her
party
it
was
only
an
island
he
said
only
an
island
how
why
what
island
what
do
you
mean
cried
weldon
incredulously
what
island
can
it
be
the
chart
perhaps
will
tell
us
replied
dick
and
hurrying
off
to
his
own
cabin
he
immediately
returned
with
the
chart
in
his
hands
after
studying
it
attentively
for
a
few
minutes
he
said
there
weldon
the
land
we
have
just
passed
i
should
suppose
must
be
that
little
speck
in
the
midst
of
the
pacific
it
must
be
easter
island
at
least
there
seems
to
be
no
other
land
which
possibly
it
could
be
and
do
you
say
inquired
weldon
that
we
have
left
it
quite
behind
us
yes
entirely
almost
to
windward
weldon
commenced
a
searching
scrutiny
of
the
map
that
was
outspread
before
her
how
far
is
this
she
said
after
bending
a
considerable
time
over
the
chart
how
far
is
this
from
the
coast
of
america
degrees
answered
dick
somewhere
about
miles
what
ever
do
you
mean
rejoined
the
lady
astonished
if
the
is
still
miles
from
shore
she
has
positively
made
no
progress
at
all
impossible
in
thoughtful
perplexity
dick
passed
his
hand
across
his
brow
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
after
an
interval
of
silence
he
said
i
have
no
account
to
give
for
the
strange
delay
it
is
inexplicable
to
myself
except
upon
that
one
hypothesis
which
i
can
not
resist
that
the
readings
of
the
compass
somehow
or
other
have
been
wrong
he
relapsed
into
silence
then
brightening
up
he
added
but
thank
god
at
least
we
have
now
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
where
we
really
are
we
are
no
longer
lost
upon
the
wide
pacific
if
only
this
hurricane
will
cease
long
as
the
distance
seems
we
are
on
our
proper
course
to
the
shores
of
america
the
tone
of
confidence
with
which
the
youthful
captain
spoke
had
the
effect
of
inspiring
new
hope
into
all
who
heard
him
their
spirits
rose
and
to
their
sanguine
mood
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
approaching
to
the
end
of
all
their
troubles
and
had
hardly
more
to
do
than
to
await
the
turning
of
a
tide
to
bring
them
into
a
glad
proximity
to
port
easter
island
of
which
the
true
name
is
was
discovered
by
david
in
and
visited
by
cook
and
lapérouse
it
lies
in
lat
and
long
consequently
it
was
evident
that
during
the
raging
of
the
hurricane
the
schooner
had
been
driven
northwards
no
less
than
fifteen
degrees
far
away
however
as
she
was
from
shore
the
wind
could
hardly
fail
within
ten
days
to
carry
her
within
sight
of
land
and
then
if
the
storm
had
worn
itself
out
as
probably
it
would
the
pilgrim
would
again
hoist
sail
and
make
her
way
into
some
port
with
safety
anyhow
the
discovery
of
his
true
position
restored
a
spirit
of
confidence
to
dick
sands
and
he
anticipated
the
time
when
he
should
no
longer
be
drifting
helplessly
before
the
storm
to
say
the
truth
the
pilgrim
had
suffered
very
little
from
the
prolonged
fury
of
the
weather
the
damage
she
had
sustained
was
limited
to
the
loss
of
the
topsail
and
the
small
jib
which
could
be
easily
replaced
the
caulking
of
the
seams
remained
thoroughly
sound
and
no
drop
of
water
had
found
its
way
into
the
hold
the
pumps
too
were
perfectly
free
dick
sands
did
not
fear
for
the
stability
of
his
ship
his
only
anxiety
was
lest
the
weather
should
not
moderate
in
time
only
let
the
wind
subside
and
the
schooner
once
more
would
be
under
his
control
but
he
never
forgot
that
the
ordering
of
the
winds
and
waves
were
in
the
hands
of
the
great
disposer
of
all

it
was
not
long
before
dick
sanguine
expectations
were
partially
realized
for
on
the
very
next
day
which
was
the
the
barometer
began
to
rise
not
rapidly
but
steadily
indicating
that
its
elevation
would
probably
continue
the
sea
remained
exceedingly
rough
but
the
violence
of
the
wind
which
had
veered
slightly
towards
the
west
had
perceptibly
diminished
the
tempest
had
passed
its
greatest
fury
and
was
beginning
to
wear
itself
out
not
a
sail
however
could
yet
be
hoisted
the
smallest
show
of
canvas
would
have
been
carried
away
in
an
instant
nevertheless
dick
hoped
that
before
another
hours
were
over
the
pilgrim
might
be
able
to
carry
a
in
the
course
of
the
night
the
wind
moderated
still
more
and
the
pitching
of
the
ship
had
so
far
diminished
that
the
passengers
began
to
reappear
on
deck
weldon
was
the
first
to
leave
her
enforced
imprisonment
she
was
anxious
to
speak
to
dick
whom
she
might
have
expected
to
find
looking
pale
and
wan
after
his
almost
superhuman
exertions
and
loss
of
sleep
but
she
was
mistaken
however
much
the
lad
might
suffer
from
the
strain
in
at
present
he
exhibited
no
symptoms
of
failing
energy
well
captain
dick
how
are
you
she
said
as
she
advanced
towards
him
holding
out
her
hand
dick
smiled
you
call
me
captain
weldon
he
answered
but
you
do
not
seem
disposed
to
submit
implicitly
to
captain
orders
did
i
not
direct
you
to
keep
to
your
cabin
illustration
you
have
acquitted
yourself
like
a
man
you
did
replied
the
lady
but
observing
how
much
the
storm
had
abated
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
disobey
you
yes
madam
the
weather
is
far
more
promising
the
barometer
has
not
fallen
since
yesterday
morning
and
i
really
trust
the
worst
is
over
now
thank
heaven
she
replied
and
after
a
few
moments
silence
she
but
now
dick
you
must
really
take
some
rest
you
may
perhaps
not
know
how
much
you
require
it
but
it
is
absolutely
necessary
rest
the
boy
repeated
rest
i
want
no
rest
i
have
only
done
my
duty
and
it
will
be
time
enough
for
me
to
concern
myself
about
my
own
rest
when
i
have
seen
my
passengers
in
a
place
of
safety
you
have
acquitted
yourself
like
a
man
said
weldon
and
you
may
be
assured
that
my
husband
like
myself
will
never
forget
the
services
you
have
rendered
me
i
shall
urge
upon
him
the
request
which
i
am
sure
he
will
not
refuse
that
you
shall
have
your
studies
completed
so
that
you
may
be
made
a
captain
for
the
firm
tears
of
gratitude
rose
to
dick
eyes
he
deprecated
the
praise
that
was
lavished
upon
him
but
rejoiced
in
the
prospect
that
seemed
opening
upon
his
future
weldon
assured
him
that
he
was
dear
as
a
son
to
her
and
pressed
a
gentle
kiss
upon
his
forehead
the
lad
felt
that
he
was
animated
if
need
be
to
yet
greater
hardships
in
behalf
of
his
benefactors
and
resolved
to
prove
himself
even
more
worthy
of
their
confidence
by
the
the
wind
had
so
far
moderated
that
dick
thought
he
might
increase
the
pilgrim
speed
by
hoisting
the
foresail
and
topsail
now
my
men
i
have
some
work
for
you
he
said
to
the
negroes
when
he
came
on
deck
at
daybreak
all
right
captain
answered
hercules
we
are
growing
rusty
for
want
of
something
to
do
why
did
you
blow
with
your
big
mouth
said
little
jack
you
could
have
beaten
the
wind
all
to
nothing
dick
laughed
and
said
not
a
bad
idea
jack
if
ever
we
get
becalmed
we
must
get
hercules
to
blow
into
the
sails
i
shall
be
most
happy
retorted
the
giant
and
he
inflated
his
huge
checks
till
he
was
the
very
impersonation
of
boreas
himself
but
now
to
work
cried
dick
we
have
lost
our
topsail
and
we
must
contrive
to
hoist
another
not
an
easy
matter
i
can
tell
you
i
dare
say
we
shall
manage
it
replied
actæon
we
must
do
our
best
said
tom
ca
i
help
inquired
jack
of
course
you
can
answered
dick
run
along
to
the
wheel
and
assist
bat
jack
strutted
off
proud
enough
of
his
commission
under
dick
directions
the
negroes
commenced
their
somewhat
difficult
task
the
new
topsail
rolled
up
had
first
of
all
to
be
hoisted
and
then
to
be
made
fast
to
the
yard
but
so
adroitly
did
the
crew
carry
out
their
orders
that
in
less
than
an
hour
the
sail
was
properly
set
and
flying
with
a
couple
of
reefs
the
foresail
and
second
jib
which
had
been
taken
down
before
the
tempest
were
hoisted
again
and
before
ten
the
pilgrim
was
running
along
under
the
three
sails
which
dick
considered
were
as
much
as
it
was
prudent
to
carry
even
at
her
present
speed
the
schooner
he
reckoned
would
be
within
sight
of
the
american
shore
in
about
ten
days
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
him
to
find
that
she
was
no
longer
at
the
mercy
of
the
waves
and
when
he
saw
the
sails
properly
set
he
returned
in
good
spirits
to
his
post
at
the
helm
not
forgetting
to
thank
the
temporary
helmsman
for
his
services
nor
omitting
his
acknowledgment
to
master
jack
who
received
the
compliment
with
becoming
gravity
although
the
clouds
continued
to
travel
all
the
next
day
with
great
rapidity
they
were
very
much
broken
and
alternately
the
pilgrim
was
bathed
in
sunlight
and
enveloped
in
vapours
which
rolled
on
towards
the
east
as
the
weather
cleared
the
hatchways
were
opened
in
order
to
ventilate
the
ship
and
the
outer
air
was
allowed
again
to
penetrate
not
only
the
hold
but
the
cabin
and
crew
quarters
the
wet
sails
were
hung
out
to
dry
the
deck
was
washed
down
for
dick
sands
was
anxious
not
to
bring
his
ship
into
port
without
having
finished
her
toilet
and
he
found
that
his
crew
could
very
well
spare
a
few
hours
daily
to
get
her
into
proper
trim
illustration
they
both
examined
the
outspread
chart
notwithstanding
the
loss
of
the
log
dick
had
sufficient
experience
to
be
able
to
make
an
approximate
estimate
of
the
schooner
progress
and
after
having
pointed
out
to
weldon
what
he
imagined
was
the
pilgrim
true
position
he
told
her
that
it
was
his
firm
impression
that
land
would
be
sighted
in
little
more
than
a
week
and
upon
what
part
of
south
america
do
you
reckon
we
are
likely
to
find
ourselves
she
asked
that
is
more
than
i
dare
venture
to
promise
replied
dick
but
i
should
think
somewhere
hereabouts
he
was
pointing
on
the
chart
to
the
long
of
chili
and
peru
they
both
examined
the
outspread
chart
with
still
closer
attention
here
you
see
resumed
dick
here
is
the
island
we
have
just
left
we
left
it
in
the
west
the
wind
has
not
shifted
we
must
expect
to
come
in
sight
of
land
pretty
nearly
due
east
of
it
the
coast
has
plenty
of
harbours
from
any
one
of
them
you
will
be
able
easily
to
get
to
san
francisco
you
know
i
dare
say
that
the
pacific
navigation
company
steamers
touch
at
all
the
principal
ports
from
any
of
them
you
will
be
sure
to
get
direct
passage
to
california
but
do
you
mean
asked
weldon
that
you
are
not
going
yourself
to
take
the
schooner
to
san
francisco
not
direct
replied
the
young
captain
i
want
to
see
you
safe
on
shore
and
satisfactorily
on
your
homeward
way
when
that
is
done
i
shall
hope
to
get
competent
officers
to
take
the
ship
to
valparaiso
where
she
will
discharge
her
cargo
as
captain
hull
intended
and
afterwards
i
shall
work
our
way
back
to
san
francisco
ah
well
we
will
see
all
about
that
in
due
time
weldon
said
smiling
and
after
a
short
pause
added
at
one
time
dick
you
seemed
to
have
rather
a
dread
of
the
shore
quite
true
answered
dick
but
now
i
am
in
hopes
we
may
fall
in
with
some
passing
vessel
we
want
to
have
a
confirmation
as
to
our
true
position
i
can
not
tell
you
how
surprised
i
am
that
we
have
not
come
across
a
single
vessel
but
when
we
near
the
land
we
shall
be
able
to
get
a
pilot
but
what
will
happen
if
we
fail
to
get
a
pilot
was
inquiry
she
was
anxious
to
learn
how
far
the
lad
was
prepared
to
meet
any
emergency
with
unhesitating
promptness
dick
replied
why
then
unless
the
weather
takes
the
control
of
the
ship
out
of
my
hands
i
must
patiently
follow
the
coast
until
i
come
to
a
harbour
of
refuge
but
if
the
wind
should
freshen
i
should
have
to
adopt
other
measures
what
then
dick
what
then
persisted
weldon
the
boy
brow
knitted
itself
together
in
resolution
and
he
said
deliberately
i
should
run
the
ship
aground
weldon
started
however
dick
continued
there
is
no
reason
to
apprehend
this
the
weather
has
mended
and
is
likely
to
mend
and
why
should
we
fear
about
finding
a
pilot
let
us
hope
all
will
be
well
weldon
at
least
had
satisfied
herself
on
one
point
she
had
ascertained
that
although
dick
did
not
anticipate
disaster
yet
he
was
prepared
in
the
case
of
emergency
to
resort
to
measures
from
which
any
but
the
most
experienced
seaman
would
shrink
but
although
dick
equanimity
had
been
successful
in
allaying
any
misgivings
on
weldon
part
it
must
be
owned
that
the
condition
of
the
atmosphere
caused
him
very
serious
uneasiness
the
wind
remained
uncomfortably
high
and
the
barometer
gave
very
ominous
indications
that
it
would
ere
long
freshen
still
more
dick
dreaded
that
the
time
was
about
to
return
in
which
once
again
he
must
reduce
his
vessel
to
a
state
of
bare
poles
but
so
intense
was
his
aversion
to
having
his
ship
so
wrested
as
it
were
from
his
own
management
that
he
determined
to
carry
the
topsail
till
it
was
all
but
carried
away
by
the
force
of
the
blast
concerned
moreover
for
the
safety
of
his
masts
the
loss
of
which
he
acknowledged
must
be
fatal
he
had
the
shrouds
well
overhauled
and
the
backstays
considerably
tightened
more
than
once
another
contingency
occurred
to
his
mind
and
gave
him
some
anxiety
he
could
not
overlook
the
possibility
of
the
wind
changing
all
round
what
should
he
do
in
such
a
case
he
would
of
course
endeavour
by
all
means
to
get
the
schooner
on
by
incessant
tacking
but
was
there
not
the
certainty
of
a
most
hazardous
delay
and
worse
than
this
was
there
not
a
likelihood
of
the
pilgrim
being
once
again
driven
far
out
to
sea
happily
these
forebodings
were
not
realized
the
wind
after
chopping
about
for
several
days
at
one
time
blowing
from
the
north
and
at
another
from
the
south
finally
settled
down
into
a
stiffish
gale
from
the
west
which
did
nothing
worse
than
severely
strain
the
masts
in
this
weary
but
hopeful
endurance
time
passed
on
the
of
april
had
arrived
it
was
more
than
two
months
since
the
pilgrim
had
quitted
new
zealand
it
was
true
that
during
the
first
three
weeks
of
her
voyage
she
had
been
impeded
by
protracted
calms
and
contrary
winds
but
since
that
time
her
speed
had
been
rapid
the
very
tempests
had
driven
her
forwards
with
unwonted
velocity
she
had
never
failed
to
have
her
bow
towards
the
land
and
yet
land
seemed
as
remote
as
ever
the
coast
line
was
retreating
as
they
approached
it
what
could
be
the
solution
of
the
mystery
from
the
one
or
other
of
the
negroes
was
kept
incessantly
on
the
watch
dick
sands
himself
telescope
in
hand
would
repeatedly
ascend
in
the
hope
of
beholding
some
lofty
peak
of
the
andes
emerging
from
the
mists
that
hung
over
the
horizon
but
all
in
vain
false
alarms
were
given
more
than
once
sometimes
tom
sometimes
hercules
or
one
of
the
others
would
be
sure
that
a
distant
speck
they
had
descried
was
assuredly
a
mountain
ridge
but
the
vapours
were
continually
gathering
in
such
fantastic
forms
that
their
unexperienced
eyes
were
soon
deceived
and
they
seldom
had
to
wait
long
before
their
fond
delusion
was
all
dispelled
at
last
the
expected
longing
was
fulfilled
at
eight
one
morning
the
mists
seemed
broken
up
with
unusual
rapidity
and
the
horizon
was
singularly
clear
dick
had
hardly
gone
aloft
when
his
voice
rung
out
land
land
ahead
as
if
summoned
by
a
spell
every
one
was
on
deck
in
an
instant
weldon
sanguine
of
a
speedy
end
to
the
general
anxiety
little
jack
gratified
at
a
new
object
of
curiosity
cousin
benedict
already
scenting
a
new
field
for
entomological
investigation
old
nan
and
the
negroes
eager
to
set
foot
upon
american
soil
all
with
the
exception
of
negoro
all
were
on
deck
but
the
cook
did
not
stir
from
his
solitude
or
betray
any
sympathy
with
the
general
excitement
whatever
hesitation
there
might
be
at
first
soon
passed
away
one
after
another
soon
distinguished
the
shore
they
were
approaching
and
in
half
an
hour
there
was
no
room
for
the
most
sceptical
to
doubt
that
dick
was
right
there
was
land
not
far
ahead
a
few
miles
to
the
east
there
was
a
long
coast
the
chain
of
the
andes
ought
to
be
visible
but
it
was
obscured
of
course
by
the
intervening
clouds
the
pilgrim
bore
down
rapidly
towards
the
land
and
in
a
short
time
its
configuration
could
be
plainly
made
out
towards
the
the
coast
terminated
in
a
headland
of
moderate
height
sheltering
a
kind
of
roadstead
on
the
it
stretched
out
in
a
long
and
narrow
tongue
the
andes
were
still
wanting
to
the
scene
they
must
be
somewhere
in
the
background
but
at
present
strange
to
say
there
was
only
a
succession
of
low
cliffs
with
some
trees
standing
out
against
the
sky
no
human
habitation
no
harbour
not
even
an
indication
of
a
could
anywhere
be
seen
the
wind
remained
brisk
and
the
schooner
was
driving
directly
towards
the
land
with
sails
shortened
as
seemed
desirable
but
dick
realized
to
himself
the
fact
that
he
was
utterly
incapable
of
altering
her
course
with
eager
eyes
he
scrutinized
his
situation
straight
ahead
was
a
reef
over
which
the
waves
were
curling
and
around
which
the
surf
must
be
tremendous
it
could
hardly
be
more
than
a
mile
away
the
wind
seemed
brisker
than
before
after
gazing
awhile
dick
seemed
to
have
come
to
a
sudden
resolution
he
went
quickly
aft
and
took
the
helm
he
had
seen
a
little
cove
and
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
try
and
make
his
way
into
it
he
did
not
speak
a
word
he
knew
the
difficulty
of
the
task
he
had
undertaken
he
was
aware
from
the
white
foam
that
there
was
shallow
water
on
either
hand
but
he
kept
the
secret
of
the
peril
to
himself
and
sought
no
counsel
in
coming
to
his
fixed
resolve
dingo
had
been
trotting
up
and
down
the
deck
all
at
once
he
bounded
to
the
fore
and
broke
out
into
a
piteous
howl
it
roused
dick
from
his
anxious
cogitations
was
it
possible
that
the
animal
recognized
the
coast
it
almost
seemed
as
if
it
brought
back
some
painful
associations
the
howling
of
the
dog
had
manifestly
attracted
negoro
attention
the
man
emerged
from
his
cabin
and
regardless
of
the
dog
stood
close
to
the
netting
but
although
he
gazed
at
the
surf
it
did
not
seem
to
occasion
him
any
alarm
weldon
who
was
watching
him
fancied
she
saw
a
flush
rise
to
his
face
which
involuntarily
suggested
the
thought
to
her
mind
that
negoro
had
seen
the
place
before
either
she
had
no
time
or
no
wish
to
express
what
had
struck
her
for
she
did
not
mention
it
to
dick
who
at
that
moment
left
the
helm
and
came
and
stood
beside
her
dick
looked
as
if
he
were
taking
a
lingering
farewell
of
the
cove
past
which
they
were
being
carried
beyond
his
power
to
help
in
a
few
moments
he
turned
round
to
weldon
and
said
quietly
weldon
i
am
disappointed
i
hoped
to
get
the
schooner
into
yonder
cove
but
there
is
no
chance
now
if
nothing
is
done
in
half
an
hour
she
will
be
upon
that
reef
i
have
but
one
alternative
left
i
must
run
her
aground
it
will
be
utter
destruction
to
the
ship
but
there
is
no
choice
your
safety
is
the
first
and
paramount
consideration
do
you
mean
that
there
is
no
other
course
to
be
taken
dick
none
whatever
said
dick
decidedly
it
must
be
as
you
will
she
said
forthwith
ensued
the
agitating
preparations
for
stranding
weldon
jack
cousin
benedict
and
nan
were
provided
with
life
belts
while
dick
and
the
negroes
made
themselves
ready
for
being
dashed
into
the
waves
every
precaution
that
the
emergency
admitted
was
duly
taken
weldon
was
entrusted
to
the
special
charge
of
hercules
dick
made
himself
responsible
for
doing
all
he
could
for
little
jack
cousin
benedict
who
was
tolerably
calm
was
handed
over
to
bat
and
austin
while
actæon
promised
to
look
after
nan
negoro
nonchalance
implied
that
he
was
quite
capable
of
shifting
for
himself
dick
had
the
forethought
also
to
order
about
a
dozen
barrels
of
their
cargo
to
be
brought
in
front
so
that
when
the
pilgrim
struck
the
oil
escaping
and
floating
on
the
waves
would
temporarily
lull
their
fury
and
make
smoother
water
for
the
passage
of
the
ship
after
satisfying
himself
that
there
was
no
other
measure
to
be
taken
to
ameliorate
the
peril
dick
sands
returned
to
the
helm
the
schooner
was
all
but
upon
the
reef
and
only
a
few
cables
length
from
the
shore
her
starboard
quarter
indeed
was
already
bathed
in
the
seething
foam
and
any
instant
the
keel
might
be
expected
to
grate
upon
the
rock
presently
a
change
of
colour
in
the
water
was
observed
it
revealed
a
passage
between
the
rocks
dick
gave
the
wheel
a
turn
he
saw
the
chance
of
getting
aground
nearer
to
the
shore
than
he
had
dared
to
hope
and
he
made
the
most
of
it
he
steered
the
schooner
right
into
the
narrow
channel
the
sea
was
furious
and
dashed
vehemently
upon
the
crags
on
either
hand
illustration
the
sea
was
furious
and
dashed
vehemently
upon
the
crags
on
either
hand
now
my
lads
he
cried
to
his
crew
now
your
time
out
with
your
oil
let
it
run
ready
for
the
order
the
negroes
poured
out
the
oil
and
the
raging
waters
were
stilled
as
if
by
magic
a
few
moments
more
and
perchance
they
would
rage
more
vehemently
than
ever
but
for
the
instant
they
were
lulled
the
pilgrim
meanwhile
had
glided
onwards
and
made
dead
for
the
adjacent
shore
there
was
a
sudden
shock
caught
by
an
enormous
wave
the
schooner
had
been
hurled
aground
her
masts
had
fallen
fortunately
without
injury
to
any
one
on
board
but
the
vessel
had
parted
amidships
and
was
foundering
the
water
was
rushing
irresistibly
into
the
hold
the
shore
however
was
not
half
a
cable
length
away
there
was
a
low
dark
ridge
of
rocks
that
was
united
to
the
beach
it
afforded
ample
means
of
rescue
and
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
pilgrim
captain
crew
and
passengers
were
all
landed
with
their
lives
at
the
foot
of
the
overhanging
cliff
chapter
xiv
ashore
thus
after
a
voyage
of
days
the
pilgrim
had
stranded
weldon
and
her
joined
in
thanksgiving
to
the
kind
providence
that
had
brought
them
ashore
not
upon
one
of
the
solitary
islands
of
polynesia
but
upon
a
solid
continent
from
almost
any
part
of
which
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
getting
home
the
ship
was
totally
lost
she
was
lying
in
the
surf
a
hopeless
wreck
and
few
must
be
the
hours
that
would
elapse
before
she
would
be
broken
up
in
scattered
fragments
it
was
impossible
to
save
her
notwithstanding
that
dick
sands
bewailed
the
loss
of
a
valuable
ship
and
her
cargo
to
the
owner
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
he
had
been
instrumental
in
saving
what
was
far
more
precious
the
lives
of
the
owner
wife
and
son
it
was
impossible
to
do
more
than
hazard
a
conjecture
as
to
the
part
of
the
south
american
coast
on
which
the
pilgrim
had
been
cast
dick
imagined
that
it
must
be
somewhere
on
the
coast
of
peru
after
sighting
easter
island
he
knew
that
the
united
action
of
the
equatorial
current
and
the
brisk
wind
must
have
had
the
effect
of
driving
the
schooner
far
northward
and
he
formed
his
conclusion
accordingly
be
the
true
position
however
what
it
might
it
was
all
important
that
it
should
be
accurately
ascertained
as
soon
as
possible
if
it
were
really
in
peru
he
would
not
be
long
in
finding
his
way
to
one
of
the
numerous
ports
and
villages
that
lie
along
the
coast
but
the
shore
here
was
quite
a
desert
a
narrow
strip
of
beach
strewn
with
boulders
was
enclosed
by
a
cliff
of
no
great
height
in
which
at
irregular
intervals
deep
funnels
appeared
as
chasms
in
the
rock
here
and
there
a
gentle
slope
led
to
the
top
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
north
was
the
mouth
of
a
little
river
which
had
not
been
visible
from
the
sea
its
banks
were
overhung
by
a
number
of
rhizophora
a
species
of
mangrove
entirely
distinct
from
that
indigenous
to
india
it
was
soon
ascertained
that
the
summit
of
the
cliff
was
clothed
by
a
dense
forest
extending
far
away
in
undulations
of
verdure
to
the
mountains
in
the
background
had
cousin
benedict
been
a
botanist
he
could
not
have
failed
to
find
a
new
and
interesting
field
for
his
researches
there
were
lofty
baobabs
to
which
an
extraordinary
longevity
has
often
been
erroneously
ascribed
with
bark
resembling
egyptian
syenite
there
were
white
pines
tamarinds
of
peculiar
species
and
numerous
other
plants
unfamiliar
to
the
eye
of
a
native
of
the
north
but
strange
to
say
there
was
not
a
single
specimen
of
the
extensive
family
of
palms
of
which
more
than
a
thousand
varieties
are
scattered
in
profusion
in
so
many
quarters
of
the
globe
above
the
shore
hovered
a
large
number
of
screeching
birds
mostly
of
the
swallow
tribe
their
black
plumage
shot
with
steelly
blue
and
shading
off
to
a
light
brown
at
the
top
of
the
head
now
and
then
a
few
partridges
of
a
greyish
colour
rose
on
wing
their
necks
entirely
bare
of
feathers
the
fearless
manner
in
which
the
various
birds
all
allowed
themselves
to
be
approached
made
weldon
and
dick
both
wonder
if
the
shores
upon
which
they
had
been
thrown
were
not
so
deserted
that
the
sound
of
was
not
known
on
the
edge
of
the
reefs
some
pelicans
of
the
species
known
as
were
busily
filling
their
pouches
with
tiny
fish
and
some
gulls
coming
in
from
the
open
sea
began
to
circle
round
the
wreck
with
these
exceptions
not
a
living
creature
appeared
in
sight
benedict
no
doubt
could
have
discovered
many
entomological
novelties
amongst
the
foliage
but
these
could
give
no
more
information
than
the
birds
as
to
the
name
of
their
habitat
neither
north
nor
south
nor
towards
the
forest
was
there
trace
of
rising
smoke
or
any
footprint
or
other
sign
to
indicate
the
presence
of
a
human
being
dick
surprise
was
very
great
he
knew
that
the
proximity
of
a
native
would
have
made
dingo
bark
aloud
but
the
dog
gave
no
warning
he
was
running
backwards
and
forwards
his
tail
lowered
and
his
nose
close
to
the
ground
now
and
again
he
uttered
a
deep
growl
look
at
dingo
said
weldon
how
strange
he
is
he
seems
to
be
trying
to
discover
a
lost
scent
after
watching
the
dog
for
a
time
she
spoke
again
look
too
at
negoro
he
and
the
dog
seem
to
be
on
the
same
purpose
as
to
negoro
said
dick
i
can
not
concern
myself
with
him
now
he
must
do
as
he
pleases
i
have
no
further
control
over
him
his
service
expires
with
the
loss
of
the
ship
negoro
was
in
fact
walking
to
and
fro
surveying
the
shore
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
trying
to
recall
some
past
experience
to
his
recollection
his
dogged
taciturnity
was
too
well
known
for
any
one
to
think
of
questioning
him
every
one
was
accustomed
to
let
him
go
his
own
way
and
when
dick
noticed
that
he
had
gone
towards
the
little
river
and
had
disappeared
behind
the
cliff
he
thought
no
more
about
him
dingo
likewise
had
quite
forgotten
his
enemy
and
desisted
from
his
growling
the
first
necessity
for
the
shipwrecked
party
was
to
find
a
temporary
shelter
where
they
might
take
some
refreshment
there
was
no
lack
of
provisions
independently
of
the
resources
of
the
land
the
ebbing
tide
had
left
upon
the
rocks
the
great
bulk
of
the
pilgrim
stores
and
the
negroes
had
already
collected
several
kegs
of
biscuit
and
a
number
of
cases
of
preserved
meat
besides
a
variety
of
other
supplies
all
that
they
rescued
they
carefully
piled
up
above
mark
as
nothing
appeared
to
be
injured
by
the
the
victualling
of
the
party
all
seemed
to
be
satisfactorily
secure
for
the
interval
which
must
elapse
and
they
all
believed
it
would
not
be
long
before
they
reached
one
of
the
villages
which
they
presumed
were
close
at
hand
dick
moreover
took
the
precaution
of
sending
hercules
to
get
a
small
supply
of
fresh
water
from
the
river
hard
by
and
the
fellow
returned
carrying
a
whole
on
his
shoulder
illustration
surveying
the
shore
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
trying
to
recall
some
past
experience
plenty
of
fuel
was
lying
about
and
whenever
they
wanted
to
light
a
fire
they
were
sure
of
having
an
abundance
of
dead
wood
and
the
roots
of
the
old
mangroves
old
tom
an
inveterate
smoker
always
carried
a
tinder
box
in
his
pocket
this
had
been
too
tightly
fastened
to
be
affected
by
the
moisture
and
could
always
produce
a
spark
upon
occasion
still
they
must
have
a
shelter
without
some
rest
it
was
impossible
to
start
upon
a
tour
of
exploration
accordingly
all
interests
were
directed
towards
ascertaining
where
the
necessary
repose
could
be
obtained
the
honour
of
discovering
where
the
desired
retreat
could
be
found
fell
to
the
lot
of
little
jack
trotting
about
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
he
came
upon
one
of
those
grottoes
which
are
constantly
being
found
hollowed
out
in
the
rock
by
the
vehement
action
of
the
waves
in
times
of
tempest
here
look
here
cried
the
child
here
a
place
well
done
jack
answered
his
mother
your
lucky
discovery
is
just
what
we
wanted
if
we
were
going
to
stay
here
any
time
we
should
have
to
do
the
same
as
the
swiss
family
robinson
and
name
the
spot
after
you
it
was
hardly
more
than
twelve
or
fourteen
feet
square
and
yet
the
grotto
seemed
to
jack
to
be
a
gigantic
cavern
but
narrow
as
its
limits
were
it
was
capacious
enough
to
receive
the
entire
party
it
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
weldon
to
observe
that
it
was
perfectly
dry
and
as
the
moon
was
just
about
her
first
quarter
there
was
no
likelihood
of
a
tide
rising
to
the
foot
of
the
cliff
at
any
rate
it
was
resolved
that
they
might
take
up
their
quarters
there
for
a
few
hours
shortly
after
one
the
whole
party
were
seated
upon
a
carpet
of
seaweed
round
a
repast
consisting
of
preserved
meat
biscuit
and
water
flavoured
with
a
few
drops
of
rum
of
which
bat
had
saved
a
quart
bottle
from
the
wreck
even
negoro
had
returned
and
joined
the
group
probably
he
had
not
cared
to
venture
alone
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
into
the
forest
he
sat
listening
as
it
seemed
indifferently
to
the
various
plans
for
the
future
that
were
being
discussed
and
did
not
open
his
mouth
either
by
way
of
remonstrance
or
suggestion
dingo
was
not
forgotten
and
had
his
share
of
food
duly
given
him
outside
the
grotto
where
he
was
keeping
guard
when
the
meal
was
ended
weldon
passing
her
arms
round
jack
who
was
lounging
half
asleep
with
excitement
and
fatigue
at
her
side
was
the
first
to
speak
my
dear
dick
she
said
in
the
name
of
us
all
let
me
thank
you
for
the
services
you
have
rendered
us
in
our
tedious
time
of
difficulty
as
you
have
been
our
captain
at
sea
let
me
beg
you
to
be
our
guide
upon
land
we
shall
have
perfect
confidence
in
your
judgment
and
await
your
instructions
as
to
what
our
next
proceedings
shall
be
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
dick
even
negoro
appeared
to
be
roused
to
curiosity
as
if
eager
to
know
what
he
had
to
say
dick
did
not
speak
for
some
moments
he
was
manifestly
pondering
what
step
he
should
advise
after
a
while
he
said
my
own
impression
weldon
is
that
we
have
been
cast
ashore
upon
one
of
the
parts
of
the
coast
of
peru
and
that
we
are
near
the
borders
of
the
pampas
in
that
case
i
should
conclude
that
we
are
at
a
considerable
distance
from
any
village
now
i
should
recommend
that
we
stay
here
altogether
for
the
coming
night
morning
two
of
us
can
start
off
on
an
exploring
expedition
i
entertain
but
little
doubt
that
natives
will
be
met
with
within
ten
or
a
dozen
miles
weldon
looked
doubtful
plainly
she
thought
unfavourably
of
the
project
of
separating
the
party
she
reflected
for
a
considerable
time
and
then
asked
and
who
is
to
undertake
the
task
of
exploring
prompt
was
dick
answer
tom
and
i
and
leave
us
here
suggested
the
lady
yes
to
take
care
of
you
there
will
be
hercules
bat
actæon
and
austin
negoro
too
i
presume
means
to
remain
here
said
dick
glancing
towards
the
cook
perhaps
replied
negoro
sparing
as
ever
of
his
words
we
shall
take
dingo
added
dick
likely
enough
he
may
be
useful
at
the
sound
of
his
name
the
dog
had
entered
the
grotto
a
short
bark
seemed
to
testify
his
approval
of
dick
proposal
weldon
was
silent
she
looked
sad
and
thoughtful
it
was
hard
to
reconcile
herself
to
the
division
of
the
party
she
was
aware
that
the
separation
would
not
be
for
long
but
she
could
not
suppress
a
certain
feeling
of
nervousness
was
it
not
possible
that
some
natives
attracted
by
the
wreck
would
assault
them
in
hopes
of
plunder
every
argument
he
could
think
of
dick
brought
forward
to
reassure
the
lady
he
told
her
that
the
indians
were
perfectly
harmless
and
entirely
different
to
the
savage
tribes
of
africa
and
polynesia
there
was
no
reason
to
apprehend
any
mischief
even
if
they
should
chance
to
encounter
them
which
was
itself
extremely
unlikely
no
doubt
the
separation
would
have
its
inconveniences
but
they
would
be
insignificant
compared
with
the
difficulty
of
traversing
the
country
tom
and
he
would
have
far
greater
freedom
if
they
went
alone
and
could
make
their
investigations
much
more
thoroughly
finally
he
promised
that
if
within
two
days
they
failed
to
discover
human
habitation
they
would
return
to
the
grotto
forthwith
i
confess
however
he
added
that
i
have
little
expectation
of
being
able
to
ascertain
our
true
position
until
i
have
penetrated
some
distance
into
the
country
there
was
nothing
in
dick
representations
but
what
commanded
weldon
assent
as
reasonable
it
was
simply
her
own
nervousness
she
acknowledged
that
made
her
hesitate
but
it
was
only
with
extreme
reluctance
that
she
finally
yielded
to
the
proposition
and
what
benedict
is
your
opinion
of
my
proposal
said
dick
turning
to
the
entomologist
i
answered
cousin
benedict
looking
somewhat
bewildered
oh
i
am
agreeable
to
anything
i
dare
say
i
shall
find
some
specimens
i
think
i
will
go
and
look
at
once
take
my
advice
and
do
go
far
away
replied
dick
all
right
i
shall
take
care
of
myself
and
do
be
bringing
back
a
lot
of
mosquitoes
said
old
tom
mischievously
with
his
box
under
his
arm
the
naturalist
left
the
grotto
negoro
followed
almost
immediately
he
did
not
take
the
same
direction
as
benedict
up
the
cliff
but
for
the
second
time
bent
his
steps
towards
the
river
and
proceeded
along
its
bank
till
he
was
out
of
sight
it
was
not
long
before
jack
exertions
told
upon
him
and
he
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
weldon
having
gently
laid
him
on
nan
lap
wandered
out
and
made
her
way
to
the
water
edge
she
was
soon
joined
by
dick
and
the
negroes
who
wanted
to
see
whether
it
was
possible
to
get
to
the
pilgrim
and
secure
any
articles
that
might
be
serviceable
for
future
use
the
reef
on
which
the
schooner
had
stranded
was
now
quite
dry
and
the
carcase
of
the
vessel
which
had
been
partially
covered
at
high
water
was
lying
in
the
midst
of
of
the
most
promiscuous
character
the
wide
difference
between
high
and
mark
caused
dick
sands
no
little
surprise
he
knew
that
the
tides
on
the
shores
of
the
pacific
were
very
inconsiderable
in
his
own
mind
however
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
phenomenon
was
to
be
explained
by
the
unusually
high
wind
that
had
been
blowing
on
the
coast
not
without
emotion
could
weldon
or
indeed
any
of
them
behold
the
unfortunate
ship
upon
which
they
had
spent
so
many
eventful
days
lying
dismasted
on
her
side
but
there
was
little
time
for
sentiment
if
they
wished
to
visit
the
hull
before
it
finally
went
to
pieces
there
must
be
no
delay
hoisting
themselves
by
some
loose
rigging
that
was
hanging
from
the
deck
dick
and
several
of
the
negroes
contrived
to
make
their
way
into
the
interior
of
the
hull
dick
left
his
men
to
gather
together
all
they
could
in
the
way
of
food
and
drink
from
the
and
himself
went
straight
to
the
stern
cabin
into
which
the
water
had
not
penetrated
here
he
found
four
excellent
purday
remington
rifles
and
a
hundred
cartridges
with
these
he
determined
to
arm
his
party
in
case
they
should
be
attacked
by
indians
he
also
chose
six
of
the
strongest
of
the
cutlasses
that
are
used
for
slicing
up
dead
whales
and
did
not
forget
the
little
toy
gun
which
was
jack
special
property
unexpectedly
he
found
a
which
he
was
only
too
glad
to
appropriate
what
a
boon
it
would
have
been
had
he
discovered
it
earlier
the
ship
charts
in
the
were
too
much
injured
by
water
to
be
of
any
further
service
nearly
everything
was
either
lost
or
spoiled
but
the
misfortune
was
not
felt
very
acutely
because
there
was
ample
provision
for
a
few
days
and
it
seemed
useless
to
burden
themselves
with
more
than
was
necessary
dick
hardly
needed
weldon
advice
to
secure
all
the
money
that
might
be
on
board
but
after
the
most
diligent
search
he
failed
to
discover
more
than
five
hundred
dollars
this
was
a
subject
of
perplexity
weldon
herself
had
had
a
considerably
larger
sum
than
this
and
captain
hull
was
known
always
to
keep
a
good
reserve
in
hand
there
was
but
one
way
to
solve
the
mystery
some
one
had
been
beforehand
to
the
wreck
it
could
not
be
any
of
the
negroes
as
not
one
of
them
had
for
a
moment
left
the
grotto
suspicion
naturally
fell
upon
negoro
who
had
been
out
alone
upon
the
shore
morose
and
as
the
man
was
dick
hardly
knew
why
he
should
suspect
him
of
the
crime
of
theft
nevertheless
he
determined
to
him
and
if
need
be
to
have
him
searched
as
soon
as
he
came
back
illustration
not
without
emotion
could
weldon
or
indeed
any
of
them
behold
the
unfortunate
ship
the
day
wore
onwards
to
its
close
the
sun
was
approaching
the
vernal
equinox
and
sank
almost
perpendicularly
on
to
the
horizon
twilight
was
very
short
and
the
rapidity
with
which
darkness
came
on
confirmed
dick
in
his
belief
that
they
had
got
ashore
at
some
spot
lying
between
the
tropic
of
capricorn
and
the
equator
they
all
assembled
in
the
grotto
again
for
the
purpose
of
getting
some
sleep
another
rough
night
coming
on
said
tom
pointing
to
the
heavy
clouds
that
hung
over
the
horizon
no
doubt
tom
answered
dick
and
i
think
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
on
being
safe
out
of
our
poor
ship
as
the
night
could
not
be
otherwise
than
very
dark
it
was
arranged
that
the
negroes
should
take
their
turns
in
keeping
guard
at
the
entrance
of
the
grotto
dingo
also
would
be
upon
the
alert
benedict
had
not
yet
returned
hercules
shouted
his
name
with
the
full
strength
of
his
capacious
lungs
and
shortly
afterwards
the
entomologist
was
seen
making
his
way
down
the
face
of
the
cliff
at
the
imminent
risk
of
breaking
his
neck
he
was
in
a
great
rage
he
had
not
found
a
single
insect
worth
having
scorpions
scolopendra
and
other
myriapoda
were
in
the
forest
in
abundance
but
not
one
of
these
of
course
could
be
allowed
a
place

collection

i
come

cried

i
endured
storm

not

to
be

the
country
is
detestable
i
shall
not
stay
in
it
another
hour

gentle
to
his
eccentricities
weldon
soothed
him
as
she
would
a
child
she
told
him
that
he
had
better
take
some
rest
now
and
most
likely
he
would
have
better
luck

benedict
had
hardly
been
pacified
when
tom
remarked
that
negoro
too
had
not
returned
never
mind
said

his
room
is
as
good
as
his
company
i
can
not
say
that
i
altogether
think
so
the
man
is
no
favourite
of
mine
but
i
like
him
better
under
my
own
eye
said
weldon
perhaps
he
has
his
own
reasons
for
keeping
away
said
dick
and
taking
weldon
aside
he
communicated
to
her
his
suspicions
of
the
fellow
dishonesty
he
found
that
she
coincided
with
him
in
her
view
of
negoro
conduct
but
she
did
not
agree
with
him
in
his
proposal
to
have
him
searched
at
once
if
he
returned
she
should
be
convinced
that
he
had
deposited
the
money
in
some
secret
spot
and
as
there
would
be
no
proof
of
his
guilt
it
would
be
better
to
leave
him

a
time

dick
was
convinced
by
her
representations
and
promised
to
act
upon
her
advice
before
they
resigned
themselves
to
sleep
they
had
repeatedly
summoned
negoro
back
but
he
either
could
not
or
would
not
hear
weldon
and
dick
scarcely
knew
what
to
think
unless
he
had
lost
his
way
it
was
unaccountable
why
he
should
be
wandering
about
alone
on
a
dark
night
in
a
strange
country
presently
dingo
was
heard
barking
furiously
he
had
left
the
opening
of
the
grotto
and
was
evidently
down
at
the
water
edge
imagining
that
negoro
must
be
coming
dick
sent
three
of
the
negroes
in
the
direction
of
the
river
to
meet
him
but
when
they
reached
the
bank
not
a
soul
could
be
seen

dingo
was
quiet
again
they
made
their
way
back
to
the
grotto

the
man
left
on
watch
they
now
all
lay
down
hoping
to
get
some
repose
weldon
however
could
not
sleep
the
land
for
which
she
had
sighed
so
ardently
had
been
reached

it
had
failed
to
give
either
the
security

comfort

a
stranger
at
daybreak
next
morning
austin
who
happened
to
be
on
guard
heard
dingo
bark
and
noticed
that
he
started
up
and
ran
towards
the
river
arousing
the
inmates
of
the
grotto
he
announced
to
them
that
some
one
was
coming
it
is
negoro
said
tom
dingo
would
bark
louder
than
that
if
negoro
were
to
be
seen
who
then
can
it
be
asked
weldon
with
an
inquiring
glance
towards
dick
we
must
wait
and
see
madam
replied
dick
quietly
bidding
bat
austin
and
hercules
follow
his
example
dick
sands
took
up
a
cutlass
and
a
rifle
into
the
breach
of
which
he
slipped
a
cartridge
thus
armed
the
four
young
men
made
their
way
towards
the
river
bank
tom
and
actæon
were
left
with
weldon
at
the
entrance
of
the
grotto
the
sun
was
just
rising
its
rays
intercepted
by
the
lofty
range
of
mountains
in
the
east
did
not
fall
directly
on
the
cliff
but
the
sea
to
its
western
horizon
was
sparkling
in
the
sunbeams
as
the
party
marched
along
the
shore
dingo
was
motionless
as
a
setter
but
did
not
cease
barking
it
soon
proved
not
to
be
his
old
enemy
who
was
disturbing
him
a
man
who
was
not
negoro
appeared
round
the
angle
of
the
cliff
and
advancing
cautiously
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
seemed
by
his
gestures
to
be
endeavouring
to
pacify
the
dog
with
which
an
encounter
would
certainly
have
been
by
no
means
desirable
that
not
negoro
said
hercules
illustration
good
morning
my
young
friend
no
loss
for
any
of
us
muttered
bat
you
are
right
replied
dick
perhaps
he
is
a
native
let
us
hope
he
may
be
able
to
tell
us
our
whereabouts
and
save
us
the
trouble
of
exploring
with
their
rifles
on
their
shoulders
they
advanced
steadily
towards
the
new
arrival
the
stranger
on
becoming
aware
of
their
approach
manifested
great
surprise
he
was
apparently
puzzled
as
to
how
they
had
reached
the
shore
for
the
pilgrim
had
been
entirely
broken
up
during
the
night
and
the
spars
that
were
floating
about
had
probably
been
too
few
and
too
scattered
to
attract
his
attention
his
first
attitude
seemed
to
betray
something
of
fear
and
raising
to
his
shoulder
a
gun
that
had
been
slung
to
his
belt
he
began
to
retrace
his
steps
but
conciliatory
gestures
on
the
part
of
dick
quickly
reassured
him
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
continued
to
advance
he
was
a
man
of
about
forty
years
of
age
strongly
built
with
a
keen
bright
eye
grizzly
hair
and
beard
and
a
complexion
tanned
as
with
constant
exposure
to
the
forest
air
he
wore
a
hat
a
kind
of
leather
jerkin
or
tunic
and
long
boots
reaching
nearly
to
his
knees
to
his
high
heels
was
fastened
a
pair
of
spurs
which
clanked
as
he
moved
dick
sands
in
an
instant
saw
that
he
was
not
looking
upon
one
of
the
roving
indians
of
the
pampas
but
upon
one
of
those
adventurers
often
of
very
doubtful
character
who
are
not
unfrequently
to
be
met
with
in
the
remotest
quarters
of
the
earth
clearly
this
was
neither
an
indian
nor
a
spaniard
his
erect
not
to
say
rigid
deportment
and
the
reddish
hue
with
which
his
hair
and
beard
were
streaked
betokened
him
to
be
of
origin
a
conjecture
which
was
at
once
confirmed
when
upon
dick
wishing
him
good
morning
he
replied
in
unmistakable
english
with
hardly
a
trace
of
foreign
accent
good
morning
my
young
friend
he
stepped
forward
and
having
shaken
hands
with
dick
nodded
to
all
his
companions
are
you
english
he
asked
no
we
are
americans
replied
dick
north
or
south
inquired
the
man
north
dick
answered
the
information
seemed
to
afford
the
stranger
no
little
satisfaction
and
he
again
wrung
dick
hand
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
a
and
may
i
ask
what
brings
you
here
he
continued
before
however
dick
had
time
to
reply
the
stranger
had
courteously
raised
his
hat
and
looking
round
dick
saw
that
his
bow
was
intended
for
weldon
who
had
just
reached
the
she
proceeded
to
tell
him
the
particulars
of
how
they
had
been
shipwrecked
and
how
the
vessel
had
gone
to
pieces
on
the
reefs
a
look
of
pity
crossed
the
man
face
as
he
listened
and
he
cast
his
eye
as
it
might
be
involuntarily
upon
the
sea
in
order
to
discern
some
vestige
of
the
stranded
ship
ah
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
of
our
poor
schooner
said
dick
mournfully
the
last
of
her
was
broken
up
in
the
storm
last
night
and
now
interposed
weldon
can
you
tell
us
where
we
are
where
exclaimed
the
man
with
every
indication
of
surprise
at
her
question
why
on
the
coast
of
south
america
of
course
but
on
what
part
are
we
near
peru
dick
inquired
eagerly
no
my
lad
no
you
are
more
to
the
south
you
are
on
the
coast
of
bolivia
close
to
the
borders
of
chili
a
good
distance
i
suppose
from
lima
asked
dick
from
lima
yes
a
long
way
lima
is
far
to
the
north
and
what
is
the
name
of
that
promontory
dick
said
pointing
to
the
adjacent
headland
that
i
confess
is
more
than
i
am
able
to
tell
you
replied
the
stranger
for
although
i
have
travelled
a
great
deal
in
the
interior
of
the
country
i
have
never
before
visited
this
part
of
the
coast
dick
pondered
in
thoughtful
silence
over
the
information
he
had
thus
received
he
had
no
reason
to
doubt
its
accuracy
according
to
his
own
reckoning
he
would
have
expected
to
come
ashore
somewhere
between
the
latitudes
of
and
and
by
this
stranger
showing
he
had
made
the
latitude
the
discrepancy
was
not
very
great
it
was
not
more
than
might
be
accounted
for
by
the
action
of
the
currents
which
he
knew
he
had
been
unable
to
estimate
moreover
the
deserted
character
of
the
whole
shore
inclined
him
to
believe
more
easily
that
he
was
in
lower
bolivia
whilst
this
conversation
was
going
on
weldon
whose
suspicions
had
been
excited
by
negoro
disappearance
had
been
scrutinizing
the
stranger
with
the
utmost
attention
but
she
could
detect
nothing
either
in
his
manner
or
in
his
words
to
give
her
any
cause
to
doubt
his
good
faith
pardon
me
she
said
presently
but
you
do
not
seem
to
me
to
be
a
native
of
peru
no
like
yourself
i
am
an
american
he
paused
as
if
waiting
to
be
told
her
name
the
lady
smiled
and
gave
her
name
he
thanked
her
and
continued
my
name
is
harris
i
was
born
in
south
carolina
but
it
is
now
twenty
years
since
i
left
my
home
for
the
pampas
of
bolivia
imagine
therefore
how
much
pleasure
it
gives
me
to
come
across
some
countrymen
of
my
own
do
you
live
in
this
part
of
the
province
mr
harris
weldon
asked
no
indeed
far
away
i
live
down
to
the
south
close
to
the
borders
of
chili
at
present
i
am
taking
a
journey
to
atacama
atacama
exclaimed
dick
are
we
anywhere
near
the
desert
of
atacama
yes
my
young
friend
rejoined
harris
you
are
just
on
the
edge
of
it
it
extends
far
beyond
those
mountains
which
you
see
on
the
horizon
and
is
one
of
the
most
curious
and
least
explored
parts
of
the
continent
and
are
you
travelling
through
it
alone
weldon
inquired
yes
quite
alone
and
it
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
performed
the
journey
one
of
my
brothers
owns
a
large
farm
the
hacienda
of
san
felice
about
miles
from
here
and
i
have
occasion
now
and
then
to
pay
him
business
visits
illustration
he
is
my
little
son
after
a
moment
hesitation
as
if
he
were
weighing
a
sudden
thought
he
continued
i
am
on
my
way
there
now
and
if
you
will
accompany
me
i
can
promise
you
a
hearty
welcome
and
my
brother
will
be
most
happy
to
do
his
best
to
provide
you
with
means
of
conveyance
to
san
francisco
weldon
had
hardly
begun
to
express
her
thanks
for
the
proposal
when
he
said
abruptly
are
these
negroes
your
slaves
slaves
sir
replied
weldon
drawing
herself
up
proudly
we
have
no
slaves
in
the
united
states
the
south
has
now
long
followed
the
example
of
the
north
slavery
is
abolished
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
i
had
forgotten
that
the
war
of
had
solved
that
question
but
seeing
these
fellows
with
you
i
thought
perhaps
they
might
be
in
your
service
he
added
with
a
slight
tone
of
irony
we
are
very
proud
to
be
of
any
service
to
weldon
tom
interposed
with
dignity
but
we
are
no
man
property
it
is
true
i
was
sold
for
a
slave
when
i
was
six
years
old
but
i
have
long
since
had
my
freedom
and
so
has
my
son
bat
here
and
all
his
friends
were
born
of
free
parents
ah
well
then
i
have
to
congratulate
you
replied
harris
in
a
manner
that
jarred
very
sensibly
upon
weldon
feelings
but
she
said
nothing
harris
added
i
can
assure
you
that
you
are
as
safe
here
in
bolivia
as
you
would
be
in
new
england
he
had
not
finished
speaking
when
jack
followed
by
nan
came
out
of
the
grotto
the
child
was
rubbing
his
eyes
having
only
just
awakened
from
his
night
sleep
catching
sight
of
his
mother
he
darted
towards
her
what
a
charming
little
boy
exclaimed
harris
he
is
my
little
son
said
weldon
kissing
the
child
by
way
of
morning
greeting
ah
madam
i
am
sure
you
must
have
suffered
doubly
on
his
account
will
the
little
man
let
me
kiss
him
too
but
there
was
something
in
the
stranger
appearance
that
did
not
take
jack
fancy
and
he
shrank
back
timidly
to
his
mother
side
you
must
excuse
him
sir
he
is
very
shy
never
mind
said
harris
we
shall
be
better
acquainted
when
we
get
to
my
brother
he
shall
have
a
nice
little
pony
to
ride
but
not
even
this
tempting
offer
seemed
to
have
any
effect
in
coaxing
jack
into
a
more
genial
mood
he
kept
fast
hold
of
his
mother
hand
and
she
somewhat
vexed
at
his
behaviour
and
anxious
that
no
offence
should
be
given
to
a
man
who
appeared
so
friendly
in
his
intentions
hastened
to
turn
the
conversation
to
another
topic
meantime
dick
sands
had
been
considering
harris
proposal
upon
the
whole
the
plan
of
making
their
way
to
the
hacienda
of
san
felice
seemed
to
commend
itself
to
his
judgment
but
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
a
journey
of
miles
across
plains
and
forests
without
any
means
of
transport
would
be
extremely
fatiguing
on
expressing
his
doubts
on
this
point
he
was
met
with
the
reply
oh
that
can
be
managed
well
enough
young
man
just
round
the
corner
of
the
cliff
there
i
have
a
horse
which
is
quite
at
the
disposal
of
the
lady
and
her
son
and
by
easy
stages
of
ten
miles
or
so
a
day
it
will
do
the
rest
of
us
no
harm
to
travel
on
foot
besides
he
added
when
i
spoke
of
the
journey
being
miles
i
was
thinking
of
following
as
i
usually
do
the
course
of
the
river
but
by
taking
a
short
cut
across
the
forest
we
may
reduce
the
distance
by
nearly
eighty
miles
weldon
was
about
to
say
how
grateful
she
was
but
harris
anticipated
her
not
a
word
madam
i
beg
you
you
can
not
thank
me
better
than
by
accepting
my
offer
i
confess
i
have
never
crossed
this
forest
but
i
am
so
much
accustomed
to
the
pampas
that
i
have
little
fear
of
losing
my
way
the
only
difficulty
is
in
the
matter
of
provisions
as
i
have
only
supplied
myself
with
enough
to
carry
me
on
to
san
felice
as
to
provisions
replied
weldon
we
have
enough
and
to
spare
and
we
shall
be
more
than
willing
to
share
everything
with
you
that
is
well
answered
harris
then
there
can
be
no
reason
why
we
should
not
start
at
once
he
was
turning
away
with
the
intention
of
fetching
his
horse
when
dick
sands
detained
him
true
to
his
seaman
instincts
the
young
sailor
felt
that
he
should
be
much
more
at
his
ease
on
the
than
traversing
the
heart
of
an
unknown
forest
pardon
me
harris
he
began
but
instead
of
taking
so
long
a
journey
across
the
desert
of
atacama
would
it
not
be
far
better
for
us
to
follow
the
coast
either
northwards
or
southwards
until
we
reach
the
nearest
seaport
a
frown
passed
over
harris
countenance
i
know
very
little
about
the
coast
he
answered
but
i
know
enough
to
assure
you
that
there
is
no
town
to
the
north
within
or
miles
then
why
should
we
not
go
south
persisted
dick
you
would
then
have
to
travel
to
chili
which
is
almost
as
far
and
under
your
circumstances
i
should
not
advise
you
to
skirt
the
pampas
of
the
argentine
republic
for
my
own
part
i
could
not
accompany
you
but
do
not
the
vessels
which
ply
between
chili
and
peru
come
within
sight
of
this
coast
interposed
weldon
no
madam
they
keep
out
so
far
to
sea
that
there
would
not
be
the
faintest
chance
of
your
hailing
one
you
seem
to
have
another
question
to
ask
harris
weldon
continued
addressing
dick
who
still
looked
rather
doubtful
dick
replied
that
he
was
about
to
inquire
at
what
port
he
would
be
likely
to
find
a
ship
to
convey
their
party
to
san
francisco
that
i
really
can
not
tell
you
my
young
friend
rejoined
harris
i
can
only
repeat
my
promise
that
we
will
furnish
you
with
the
means
of
conveyance
from
san
felice
to
atacama
where
no
doubt
you
will
obtain
all
the
information
you
require
i
hope
you
will
not
think
that
dick
is
insensible
to
your
kindness
harris
said
weldon
apologetically
on
the
contrary
promptly
observed
dick
i
fully
appreciate
it
i
only
wish
we
had
been
cast
ashore
upon
a
spot
where
we
should
have
had
no
need
to
intrude
upon
his
generosity
i
assure
you
madam
it
gives
me
unbounded
pleasure
to
serve
you
in
any
way
said
harris
it
is
as
i
have
told
you
not
often
that
i
come
in
contact
with
any
of
my
own
countrymen
then
we
accept
your
offer
as
frankly
as
it
is
made
replied
the
lady
adding
but
i
can
not
consent
to
deprive
you
of
your
horse
i
am
a
very
good
walker
so
am
i
said
harris
with
a
bow
and
consequently
i
intend
you
and
your
little
son
to
ride
i
am
used
to
long
tramps
through
the
pampas
besides
it
is
not
at
all
unlikely
that
we
shall
come
across
some
of
the
workpeople
belonging
to
the
hacienda
if
so
they
will
be
able
to
give
us
a
mount
convinced
that
it
would
only
be
thwarting
weldon
wishes
to
throw
any
further
impediment
in
the
way
dick
sands
suppressed
his
desire
to
raise
fresh
obstacles
and
simply
asked
how
soon
they
ought
to
start
this
very
day
at
once
said
harris
quickly
so
soon
asked
dick
yes
the
rainy
season
begins
in
april
and
the
sooner
we
are
at
san
felice
the
better
the
way
through
the
forest
is
the
safest
as
well
as
the
shortest
for
we
shall
be
less
likely
to
meet
any
of
the
nomad
indians
who
are
notorious
robbers
without
making
any
direct
reply
dick
proceeded
to
instruct
the
negroes
to
choose
such
of
the
provisions
as
were
most
easy
of
transport
and
to
make
them
up
into
packages
that
every
one
might
carry
a
due
share
hercules
with
his
usual
good
nature
professed
himself
willing
to
carry
the
entire
load
a
proposal
however
to
which
dick
would
not
listen
for
a
moment
you
are
a
fine
fellow
hercules
said
harris
scrutinizing
the
giant
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
you
would
be
worth
something
in
the
african
market
those
who
want
me
now
must
catch
me
first
retorted
hercules
with
a
grin
the
services
of
all
hands
were
enlisted
and
in
a
comparatively
short
time
sufficient
food
was
packed
up
to
supply
the
party
for
about
ten
days
march
you
must
allow
us
to
show
you
what
hospitality
is
in
our
power
said
weldon
addressing
her
new
acquaintance
our
breakfast
will
be
ready
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
we
shall
be
happy
if
you
will
join
us
it
will
give
me
much
pleasure
answered
harris
gaily
i
will
employ
the
interval
in
fetching
my
horse
who
has
breakfasted
already
i
will
accompany
you
said
dick
by
all
means
my
young
friend
come
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
the
lower
part
of
the
river
while
they
were
gone
hercules
was
sent
in
search
of
cousin
benedict
who
was
wandering
on
the
top
of
the
cliff
in
quest
of
some
wonderful
insect
which
of
course
was
not
to
be
found
without
asking
his
permission
hercules
unceremoniously
brought
him
back
to
weldon
who
explained
how
they
were
about
to
start
upon
a
ten
days
march
into
the
interior
of
the
country
the
entomologist
was
quite
satisfied
with
the
arrangement
and
declared
himself
ready
for
a
march
across
the
entire
continent
as
long
as
he
was
free
to
be
adding
to
his
collection
on
the
way
thus
assured
of
her
cousin
acquiescence
in
her
plans
weldon
proceeded
to
prepare
such
a
substantial
meal
as
she
hoped
would
invigorate
them
all
for
the
approaching
journey
harris
and
dick
sands
meantime
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
cliff
and
walked
about
paces
along
the
shore
until
they
came
to
a
tree
to
which
a
horse
was
tethered
the
creature
neighed
as
it
recognized
its
master
it
was
a
animal
of
a
kind
that
dick
had
not
seen
before
although
its
long
neck
and
crupper
short
loins
flat
shoulders
and
arched
forehead
indicated
that
it
was
of
arabian
breed
illustration
they
came
to
a
tree
to
which
a
horse
was
tethered
plenty
of
strength
here
harris
said
as
after
unfastening
the
horse
he
took
it
by
the
bridle
and
began
to
lead
it
along
the
shore
dick
made
no
reply
he
was
casting
a
hasty
glance
at
the
forest
which
enclosed
them
on
either
hand
it
was
an
unattractive
sight
but
he
observed
nothing
to
give
him
any
particular
ground
for
uneasiness
turning
round
he
said
abruptly
did
you
meet
a
portuguese
last
night
named
negoro
negoro
who
is
negoro
asked
harris
in
a
tone
of
surprise
he
was
our
ship
cook
but
he
has
disappeared
drowned
probably
said
harris
indifferently
no
he
was
not
drowned
he
was
with
us
during
the
evening
but
left
afterwards
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
have
met
him
along
the
as
you
came
that
way
no
said
harris
i
saw
no
one
if
your
cook
ventured
alone
into
the
forest
most
likely
he
has
lost
his
way
it
is
possible
we
may
pick
him
up
upon
our
road
when
they
arrived
at
the
grotto
they
found
breakfast
duly
prepared
like
the
supper
of
the
previous
evening
it
consisted
mainly
of
corned
beef
and
biscuit
harris
did
ample
justice
to
the
repast
there
is
no
fear
of
our
starving
as
we
go
he
observed
to
weldon
but
i
can
hardly
say
so
much
for
the
unfortunate
portuguese
your
cook
of
whom
my
young
friend
here
has
been
speaking
ah
has
dick
been
telling
you
about
negoro
weldon
said
dick
explained
that
he
had
been
inquiring
whether
harris
had
happened
to
meet
him
in
the
direction
he
had
come
i
saw
nothing
of
him
harris
repeated
and
as
he
has
deserted
you
you
need
not
give
yourselves
any
concern
about
him
and
apparently
glad
to
turn
the
subject
he
said
now
madam
i
am
at
your
service
shall
we
start
at
once
it
was
agreed
that
there
was
no
cause
for
delay
each
one
took
up
the
package
that
had
been
assigned
him
weldon
with
hercules
help
mounted
the
horse
and
jack
with
his
miniature
gun
slung
across
his
shoulder
was
placed
astride
in
front
of
her
without
a
thought
of
acknowledging
the
kindness
of
the
stranger
in
providing
him
so
enjoyable
a
ride
the
heedless
little
fellow
declared
himself
quite
capable
of
guiding
the
gentleman
horse
and
when
to
indulge
him
the
bridle
was
put
into
his
hand
he
looked
as
proud
as
though
he
had
been
appointed
leader
of
the
whole
caravan
chapter
xvi
through
the
forest
although
there
was
no
obvious
cause
for
apprehension
it
can
not
be
denied
that
it
was
with
a
certain
degree
of
foreboding
that
dick
sands
first
entered
that
dense
forest
through
which
for
the
next
ten
days
they
were
all
to
wend
their
toilsome
way
weldon
on
the
contrary
was
full
of
confidence
and
hope
a
woman
and
a
mother
she
might
have
been
expected
to
be
conscious
of
anxiety
at
the
peril
to
which
she
might
be
exposing
herself
and
her
child
and
doubtless
she
would
have
been
sensible
of
alarm
if
her
mind
had
not
been
fully
satisfied
upon
two
points
first
that
the
portion
of
the
pampas
they
were
about
to
traverse
was
little
infested
either
by
natives
or
by
dangerous
beasts
and
secondly
that
she
was
under
the
protection
of
a
guide
so
trustworthy
as
she
believed
harris
to
be
the
entrance
to
the
forest
was
hardly
more
than
three
hundred
paces
up
the
river
an
order
of
march
had
been
arranged
which
was
to
be
observed
as
closely
as
possible
throughout
the
journey
at
the
head
of
the
troop
were
harris
and
dick
sands
one
armed
with
his
long
gun
the
other
with
his
remington
next
came
bat
and
austin
each
carrying
a
gun
and
a
cutlass
then
weldon
and
jack
on
horseback
closely
followed
by
tom
and
old
nan
while
actæon
with
the
fourth
remington
and
hercules
with
a
huge
hatchet
in
his
brought
up
the
rear
dingo
had
no
especial
place
in
the
procession
but
wandered
to
and
fro
at
his
pleasure
ever
since
he
had
been
cast
ashore
dick
had
noticed
a
remarkable
change
in
the
dog
behaviour
the
animal
was
in
a
constant
state
of
agitation
always
apparently
on
the
search
for
some
lost
scent
and
repeatedly
giving
vent
to
a
low
growl
which
seemed
to
proceed
from
grief
rather
than
from
rage
as
for
cousin
benedict
his
movements
were
permitted
to
be
nearly
as
erratic
as
dingo
nothing
but
a
could
possibly
have
kept
him
in
the
ranks
with
his
tin
box
under
his
arm
and
his
butterfly
net
in
his
hand
and
his
huge
suspended
from
his
neck
he
would
be
sometimes
far
ahead
sometimes
a
long
way
behind
and
at
the
risk
of
being
attacked
by
some
venomous
snake
would
make
frantic
dashes
into
the
tall
grass
whenever
he
espied
some
attractive
orthoptera
or
other
insect
which
he
thought
might
be
honoured
by
a
place
in
his
collection
in
one
hour
after
starting
weldon
had
called
to
him
a
dozen
times
without
the
slightest
effect
at
last
she
told
him
seriously
that
if
he
would
not
give
up
chasing
the
insects
at
a
distance
she
should
be
obliged
to
take
possession
of
his
tin
box
take
away
my
box
he
cried
with
as
much
horror
as
if
she
had
threatened
to
tear
out
his
vitals
yes
your
box
and
your
net
too
my
box
and
my
net
but
surely
not
my
spectacles
almost
shrieked
the
excited
entomologist
yes
and
your
spectacles
as
well
added
weldon
mercilessly
i
am
glad
you
have
reminded
me
of
another
means
of
reducing
you
to
obedience
the
triple
penalty
of
which
he
was
thus
warned
had
the
effect
of
keeping
him
from
wandering
away
for
the
best
part
of
the
next
hour
but
he
was
soon
once
more
missing
from
the
ranks
he
was
manifestly
incorrigible
the
deprivation
of
box
net
and
spectacles
would
it
was
acknowledged
be
utterly
without
avail
to
prevent
him
from
rambling
accordingly
it
was
thought
better
to
let
him
have
his
own
way
especially
as
hercules
volunteered
to
keep
his
eye
upon
him
and
to
endeavour
to
guard
the
worthy
naturalist
as
carefully
as
he
would
himself
protect
some
precious
specimen
of
a
lepidoptera
further
anxiety
on
his
account
was
thus
put
to
rest
illustration
the
way
across
the
forest
could
scarcely
be
called
a
path
in
spite
of
harris
confident
assertion
that
they
were
little
likely
to
be
molested
by
any
of
the
nomad
indians
the
whole
company
rejoiced
in
feeling
that
they
were
well
armed
and
they
resolved
to
keep
in
a
compact
body
the
way
across
the
forest
could
scarcely
be
called
a
path
it
was
in
fact
little
more
than
the
track
of
animals
and
progress
along
it
was
necessarily
very
slow
indeed
it
seemed
impossible
at
the
rate
they
started
to
accomplish
more
than
five
or
six
miles
in
the
course
of
twelve
hours
the
weather
was
beautifully
fine
the
sun
ascended
nearly
to
the
zenith
and
its
rays
descending
almost
perpendicularly
caused
a
degree
of
heat
which
as
harris
pointed
out
would
have
been
unendurable
upon
the
open
plain
but
was
here
pleasantly
tempered
by
the
shelter
of
the
foliage
most
of
the
trees
were
quite
strange
to
them
to
an
experienced
eye
they
were
such
as
were
remarkable
more
for
their
character
then
for
their
size
here
on
one
side
was
the
bauhinia
or
mountain
ebony
there
on
the
other
the
molompi
or
pterocarpus
its
trunk
exuding
large
quantities
of
resin
and
of
which
the
strong
light
wood
makes
excellent
oars
or
paddles
further
on
were
fustics
heavily
charged
with
colouring
matter
and
guaiacums
twelve
feet
in
diameter
surpassing
the
ordinary
kind
in
magnitude
yet
far
inferior
in
quality
dick
sands
kept
perpetually
asking
harris
to
tell
him
the
names
of
all
these
trees
and
plants
have
you
never
been
on
the
coast
of
south
america
before
replied
harris
without
giving
the
explicit
information
that
was
sought
never
said
dick
never
before
nor
do
i
recollect
ever
having
seen
any
one
who
has
but
surely
you
have
explored
the
coasts
of
columbia
or
patagonia
harris
continued
dick
avowed
that
he
had
never
had
the
chance
but
has
weldon
never
visited
these
parts
our
countrymen
i
know
are
great
travellers
no
answered
weldon
my
husband
business
called
him
occasionally
to
new
zealand
but
i
have
accompanied
him
nowhere
else
with
this
part
of
lower
bolivia
we
are
totally
unacquainted
then
madam
i
can
only
assure
you
that
you
will
see
a
most
remarkable
country
in
every
way
a
very
striking
contrast
to
the
regions
of
peru
brazil
and
the
argentine
republic
its
animal
and
vegetable
products
would
fill
a
naturalist
with
unbounded
wonder
may
i
not
declare
it
a
lucky
chance
that
has
brought
you
here
do
not
say
chance
harris
if
you
please
well
then
madam
providence
if
you
prefer
it
said
harris
with
the
air
of
a
man
incapable
of
recognizing
the
distinction
after
finding
that
there
was
no
one
amongst
them
who
was
acquainted
in
any
way
with
the
country
through
which
they
were
travelling
harris
seemed
to
exhibit
an
evident
pleasure
in
pointing
out
and
describing
by
name
the
various
wonders
of
the
forest
had
cousin
attainments
included
a
knowledge
of
botany
he
would
have
found
himself
in
a
fine
field
for
researches
and
might
perchance
have
discovered
novelties
to
which
his
own
name
could
be
appended
in
the
catalogues
of
science
but
he
was
no
botanist
in
fact
as
a
rule
he
held
all
blossoms
in
aversion
on
the
ground
that
they
entrapped
insects
into
their
corollæ
and
poisoned
them
sometimes
with
venomous
juices
new
and
rare
insects
however
seemed
hereabouts
to
be
wanting
occasionally
the
soil
became
marshy
and
they
all
had
to
wend
their
way
over
a
perfect
network
of
tiny
rivulets
that
were
affluents
of
the
river
from
which
they
had
started
sometimes
these
rivulets
were
so
wide
that
they
could
not
be
passed
without
a
long
search
for
some
spot
where
they
could
be
forded
their
banks
were
all
very
damp
and
in
many
places
abounded
with
a
kind
of
reed
which
harris
called
by
its
proper
name
of
papyrus
as
soon
as
the
marshy
district
had
been
passed
the
forest
resumed
its
original
aspect
the
footway
becoming
narrow
as
ever
harris
pointed
out
some
very
fine
larger
than
the
common
sort
and
yielding
a
wood
darker
and
more
durable
than
what
is
ordinarily
seen
in
the
market
there
were
also
more
than
might
have
been
expected
at
this
distance
from
the
sea
a
beautiful
white
lichen
enveloped
their
trunks
like
a
fur
but
in
spite
of
their
luxuriant
foliage
and
delicious
fruit
harris
said
that
there
was
not
a
native
who
would
venture
to
propagate
the
species
as
the
superstition
of
the
country
is
that
whoever
plants
a
mango
dies
illustration
occasionally
the
soil
became
marshy
at
noon
a
halt
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
rest
and
refreshment
during
the
afternoon
they
arrived
at
some
gently
rising
ground
not
the
first
slopes
of
hills
but
an
insulated
plateau
which
appeared
to
unite
mountains
and
plains
notwithstanding
that
the
trees
were
far
less
crowded
and
more
inclined
to
grow
in
detached
groups
the
numbers
of
herbaceous
plants
with
which
the
soil
was
covered
rendered
progress
no
less
difficult
than
it
was
before
the
general
aspect
of
the
scene
was
not
unlike
an
east
indian
jungle
less
luxuriant
indeed
than
in
the
lower
valley
of
the
river
the
vegetation
was
far
more
abundant
than
that
of
the
temperate
zones
either
of
the
old
or
new
continents
indigo
grew
in
great
profusion
and
according
to
harris
representation
was
the
most
encroaching
plant
in
the
whole
country
no
sooner
he
said
was
a
field
left
untilled
than
it
was
overrun
by
this
parasite
which
sprang
up
with
the
rank
growth
of
thistles
or
nettles
one
tree
which
might
have
been
expected
to
be
common
in
this
part
of
the
continent
seemed
entirely
wanting
this
was
the
caoutchouc
of
the
various
trees
from
which
is
procured
such
as
the
ficus
prinoides
the
castilioa
elastica
the
cecropia
peltata
the
callophora
utilis
the
cameraria
latifolia
and
especially
the
siphonia
elastica
all
of
which
abound
in
the
provinces
of
south
america
not
a
single
specimen
was
to
be
seen
dick
had
promised
to
show
jack
an
and
the
child
who
had
conjured
up
visions
of
squeaking
dolls
balls
and
other
toys
growing
upon
its
branches
was
loud
and
constant
in
his
expressions
of
disappointment
never
mind
my
little
man
said
harris
have
patience
and
you
shall
see
hundreds
of
when
you
get
to
the
hacienda
and
will
they
be
nice
and
elastic
asked
jack
whose
ideas
upon
the
subject
were
of
the
vaguest
order
oh
yes
they
will
stretch
as
long
as
you
like
harris
answered
laughing
but
here
is
something
to
amuse
you
he
added
and
as
he
spoke
he
gathered
a
fruit
that
looked
as
tempting
as
a
peach
you
are
quite
sure
that
it
is
safe
to
give
it
him
said
weldon
anxiously
to
satisfy
you
madam
i
will
eat
one
first
myself
the
example
he
set
was
soon
followed
by
all
the
rest
the
fruit
was
a
mango
that
which
had
been
so
opportunely
discovered
was
of
the
sort
that
ripens
in
march
or
april
there
is
a
later
kind
which
ripens
in
september
with
his
mouth
full
of
juice
jack
pronounced
that
it
was
very
nice
but
did
not
seem
to
be
altogether
diverted
from
his
sense
of
disappointment
at
not
coming
to
an
evidently
the
little
man
thought
himself
rather
injured
and
dick
promised
me
some
too
he
murmured
plenty
of
for
you
when
you
get
to
the
farm
lots
of
them
where
my
brother
lives
said
harris
and
to
say
the
truth
there
was
nothing
extravagant
in
the
way
the
child
anticipations
had
been
raised
for
in
bolivia
are
found
in
great
abundance
the
indians
who
weave
their
plumage
into
all
kinds
of
artistic
designs
have
bestowed
the
most
poetical
epithets
upon
these
gems
of
the
feathered
race
they
call
them
rays
of
the
sun
and
tresses
of
the
at
one
time
they
will
describe
them
as
king
of
flowers
at
another
as
blossoms
of
heaven
kissing
blossoms
of
earth
or
as
the
jewel
that
reflects
the
sunbeam
in
fact
their
imagination
seems
to
have
shaped
a
suitable
distinction
for
almost
every
one
of
the
known
species
of
this
dazzling
little
beauty
but
however
numerous
might
be
expected
to
be
in
the
bolivian
forest
they
proved
scarce
enough
at
present
and
jack
had
to
content
himself
with
harris
representations
that
they
did
not
like
solitude
but
would
be
found
plentifully
at
san
felice
where
they
would
be
heard
all
day
long
humming
like
a
already
jack
said
he
longed
to
be
there
a
wish
that
was
so
unanimously
echoed
by
all
the
rest
that
they
resolved
that
no
stoppage
should
be
allowed
beyond
what
was
absolutely
indispensable
after
a
time
the
forest
began
to
alter
its
aspect
the
trees
were
even
less
crowded
opening
now
and
then
into
wide
glades
the
soil
cropping
up
above
its
carpet
of
verdure
exhibited
veins
of
rose
granite
and
syenite
like
plates
of
lapis
lazuli
on
some
of
the
higher
ground
the
fleshy
tubers
of
the
sarsaparilla
plant
growing
in
a
hopeless
entanglement
made
progress
a
matter
of
still
greater
difficulty
than
in
the
narrow
tracks
of
the
dense
forest
at
sunset
the
travellers
found
that
they
had
accomplished
about
eight
miles
from
their
they
could
not
prognosticate
what
hardships
might
be
in
store
for
them
on
future
days
but
it
was
certain
that
the
experiences
of
the
first
day
had
been
neither
eventful
nor
very
fatiguing
it
was
now
unanimously
agreed
that
they
should
make
a
halt
for
the
night
and
as
little
was
to
be
apprehended
from
the
attacks
either
of
man
or
beast
it
was
considered
unnecessary
to
form
anything
like
a
regular
encampment
one
man
on
guard
to
be
relieved
every
few
hours
was
presumed
to
be
sufficient
admirable
shelter
was
offered
by
an
enormous
mango
the
spreading
foliage
of
which
formed
a
kind
of
natural
verandah
sweeping
the
ground
so
thoroughly
that
any
one
who
chose
could
find
in
its
very
branches
simultaneously
with
the
halting
of
the
party
there
was
heard
a
deafening
tumult
in
the
upper
boughs
the
mango
was
the
roosting
place
of
a
colony
of
grey
parrots
a
noisy
quarrelsome
and
rapacious
race
of
whose
true
characteristics
the
specimens
seen
in
confinement
in
europe
give
no
true
conception
their
screeching
and
chattering
were
such
a
nuisance
that
dick
sands
wanted
to
fire
a
shot
into
the
middle
of
them
but
harris
seriously
dissuaded
him
urging
that
the
report
of
firearms
would
only
serve
to
reveal
their
own
presence
whilst
their
greatest
safety
lay
in
perfect
silence
supper
was
prepared
there
was
little
need
of
cooking
the
meal
as
before
consisted
of
preserved
meat
and
biscuit
fresh
water
which
they
flavoured
with
a
few
drops
of
rum
was
obtained
from
an
adjacent
stream
which
trickled
through
the
grass
by
way
of
dessert
they
had
an
abundance
of
ripe
mangoes
and
the
only
drawback
to
their
general
enjoyment
was
the
discordant
outcry
which
the
parrots
kept
up
as
it
were
in
protest
against
the
invasion
of
what
they
held
to
be
their
own
rightful
domain
it
was
nearly
dark
when
supper
was
ended
the
evening
shade
crept
slowly
upwards
to
the
tops
of
the
trees
which
soon
stood
out
in
sharp
relief
against
the
lighter
background
of
the
sky
while
the
stars
one
by
one
began
to
peep
the
wind
dropped
and
ceased
to
murmur
through
the
foliage
to
the
general
relief
the
parrots
desisted
from
their
clatter
and
as
nature
hushed
herself
to
rest
she
seemed
to
be
inviting
all
her
children
to
follow
her
example
had
we
not
better
light
a
good
large
fire
asked
dick
by
no
means
said
harris
the
nights
are
not
cold
and
under
this
mango
the
ground
is
not
likely
to
be
damp
besides
as
i
have
told
you
before
our
best
security
consists
in
our
taking
care
to
attract
no
attention
whatever
from
without
weldon
interposed
it
may
be
true
enough
that
we
have
nothing
to
dread
from
the
indians
but
is
it
certain
that
there
are
no
dangerous
quadrupeds
against
which
we
are
bound
to
be
upon
our
guard
harris
answered
i
can
positively
assure
you
madam
that
there
are
no
animals
here
but
such
as
would
be
infinitely
more
afraid
of
you
than
you
would
be
of
them
are
there
any
woods
without
wild
beasts
asked
jack
all
woods
are
not
alike
my
boy
replied
harris
this
wood
is
a
great
park
as
the
indians
say
como
el
pariso
it
is
like
paradise
jack
persisted
there
must
be
snakes
and
lions
and
tigers
ask
your
mamma
my
boy
said
harris
whether
she
ever
heard
of
lions
and
tigers
in
america
weldon
was
endeavouring
to
put
her
little
boy
at
his
ease
on
this
point
when
cousin
benedict
interposed
saying
that
although
there
were
no
lions
or
tigers
there
were
plenty
of
jaguars
and
panthers
in
the
new
world
and
wo
they
kill
us
demanded
jack
eagerly
his
apprehensions
once
more
aroused
kill
you
laughed
harris
why
your
friend
hercules
here
could
strangle
them
two
at
a
time
one
in
each
hand
but
please
do
let
the
panthers
come
near
me
pleaded
jack
evidently
alarmed
no
no
master
jack
they
shall
not
come
near
you
i
will
give
them
a
good
grip
first
and
the
giant
displayed
his
two
rows
of
huge
white
teeth
dick
sands
proposed
that
it
should
be
the
four
younger
negroes
who
should
be
assigned
the
task
of
keeping
watch
during
the
night
in
attendance
upon
himself
but
actæon
insisted
so
strongly
upon
the
necessity
of
dick
having
his
full
share
of
rest
that
the
others
were
soon
brought
to
the
same
conviction
and
dick
was
obliged
to
yield
jack
valiantly
announced
his
intention
of
taking
one
watch
but
his
sleepy
eyelids
made
it
only
too
plain
that
he
did
not
know
the
extent
of
his
own
fatigue
i
am
sure
there
are
wolves
here
he
said
only
such
wolves
as
dingo
would
swallow
at
a
mouthful
said
harris
but
i
am
sure
there
are
wolves
he
insisted
repeating
the
word
wolves
again
and
again
until
he
tumbled
off
to
sleep
against
the
side
of
old
nan
weldon
gave
her
little
son
a
silent
kiss
it
was
her
loving
good
night
cousin
benedict
was
missing
some
little
time
before
he
had
slipped
away
in
search
of
cocuyos
or
which
he
had
heard
were
common
in
south
america
those
singular
insects
emit
a
bright
bluish
light
from
two
spots
on
the
side
of
the
thorax
and
their
colours
are
so
brilliant
that
they
are
used
as
ornaments
for
ladies
headdresses
hoping
to
secure
some
specimens
for
his
box
benedict
would
have
wandered
to
an
unlimited
distance
but
hercules
faithful
to
his
undertaking
soon
discovered
him
and
heedless
of
the
naturalist
protestations
and
vociferations
promptly
escorted
him
back
to
the
general
rendezvous
hercules
himself
was
the
first
to
keep
watch
but
with
this
exception
the
whole
party
in
another
hour
were
wrapped
in
peaceful
slumber
illustration
hercules
himself
was
the
first
to
keep
watch
chapter
xvii
misgivings
most
travellers
who
have
passed
a
night
in
a
south
american
forest
have
been
roused
from
their
slumbers
by
a
more
fantastic
than
melodious
performed
by
monkeys
as
their
ordinary
greeting
of
the
dawn
the
yelling
chattering
screeching
howling
all
unite
to
form
a
chorus
almost
unearthly
in
its
hideousness
amongst
the
various
specimens
of
the
numerous
family
of
the
quadrumana
ought
to
be
recognized
the
little
marikina
the
sagouin
with
its
face
the
grey
mora
the
skin
of
which
is
used
by
the
indians
for
covering
their
the
sapajou
with
its
singular
tuft
over
the
forehead
and
most
remarkable
of
all
the
guariba
with
its
prehensile
tail
and
diabolical
countenance
at
the
first
streak
of
daylight
the
senior
member
as
choragus
will
start
the
in
a
sonorous
barytone
the
younger
monkeys
join
in
tenor
and
alto
and
the
concert
begins
but
this
morning
there
was
no
concert
at
all
there
was
nothing
of
the
wonted
serenade
to
break
the
silence
of
the
forest
the
shrill
notes
resulting
from
the
rapid
vibration
of
the
hyoid
bones
of
the
throat
were
not
to
be
heard
indians
would
have
been
disappointed
and
perplexed
they
are
very
fond
of
the
flesh
of
the
guariba
when
smoked
and
dried
and
they
would
certainly
have
missed
the
chant
of
the
monkey
paternosters
but
dick
sands
and
his
companions
were
unfamiliar
with
any
of
these
things
and
accordingly
the
singular
quietude
was
to
them
a
matter
of
no
surprise
they
all
awoke
much
refreshed
by
their
night
rest
which
there
had
been
nothing
to
disturb
jack
was
by
no
means
the
latest
in
opening
his
eyes
and
his
first
words
were
addressed
to
hercules
asking
him
whether
he
had
caught
a
wolf
with
his
teeth
hercules
had
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
tasted
nothing
all
night
and
declared
himself
quite
ready
for
breakfast
the
whole
party
were
unanimous
in
this
respect
and
after
a
brief
morning
prayer
breakfast
was
expeditiously
served
by
old
nan
the
meal
was
but
a
repetition
of
the
last
supper
but
with
their
appetites
sharpened
by
the
fresh
forest
air
and
anxious
to
fortify
themselves
for
a
good
day
march
they
did
not
fail
to
do
ample
justice
to
their
simple
fare
even
cousin
benedict
for
once
in
his
life
at
least
partook
of
his
food
as
if
it
were
not
utterly
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
but
he
grumbled
very
much
at
the
restraint
to
which
he
considered
himself
subjected
he
could
not
see
the
good
of
coming
to
such
a
country
as
this
if
he
were
to
be
obliged
to
walk
about
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
he
protested
that
if
hercules
did
not
leave
him
alone
and
permit
him
to
catch
there
would
be
a
bone
to
pick
between
them
hercules
did
not
look
very
much
alarmed
at
the
threat
weldon
however
took
him
aside
and
telling
him
that
she
did
not
wish
to
deprive
the
enthusiast
entirely
of
his
favourite
occupation
instructed
him
to
allow
her
cousin
as
much
liberty
as
possible
provided
he
did
not
lose
sight
of
him
the
morning
meal
was
over
and
it
was
only
seven
when
the
travellers
were
once
more
on
their
way
towards
the
east
preserving
the
same
as
on
the
day
before
the
path
was
still
through
luxuriant
forest
the
vegetable
kingdom
reigned
supreme
as
the
plateau
was
immediately
adjacent
to
tropical
latitudes
the
sun
rays
during
the
summer
months
descended
perpendicularly
upon
the
virgin
soil
and
the
vast
amount
of
heat
thus
obtained
combined
with
the
abundant
moisture
retained
in
the
subsoil
caused
vegetation
to
assume
a
character
which
was
truly
magnificent
dick
sands
could
not
overcome
a
certain
sense
of
mystification
here
they
were
as
harris
told
them
in
the
region
of
the
pampas
a
word
which
he
knew
in
the
quichna
dialect
signifies
a
plain
but
he
had
always
read
that
these
plains
were
characterized
by
a
deficiency
alike
of
water
of
trees
and
rocks
he
had
always
understood
that
during
the
rainy
season
thistles
spring
up
in
great
abundance
and
grow
until
they
form
thickets
that
are
impenetrable
he
had
imagined
that
the
few
dwarf
trees
and
prickly
shrubs
that
exist
during
the
summer
only
stamp
the
general
scene
with
an
aspect
of
yet
more
thorough
bareness
and
desolation
but
how
different
was
everything
to
all
this
the
forest
never
ceased
to
stretch
away
interminably
to
the
horizon
there
were
no
tokens
of
the
rough
nakedness
that
he
had
expected
dick
seemed
to
be
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
harris
was
right
in
describing
this
plateau
of
atacama
which
he
had
for
his
part
most
firmly
believed
to
be
a
vast
desert
between
the
andes
and
the
pacific
as
a
region
that
was
quite
exceptional
in
its
natural
features
it
was
not
in
dick
character
to
keep
his
reflections
to
himself
in
the
course
of
the
morning
he
expressed
his
extreme
surprise
at
finding
the
pampas
answer
so
little
to
his
preconceived
ideas
have
i
not
understood
correctly
he
said
that
the
pampas
is
similar
to
the
north
american
savannahs
only
less
marshy
harris
replied
that
such
was
indeed
a
correct
description
of
the
pampas
of
rio
colorado
and
the
ilanos
of
venezuela
and
the
orinoco
but
he
continued
i
own
i
am
as
much
astonished
as
yourself
at
the
character
of
this
region
i
have
never
crossed
the
plateau
before
and
i
must
confess
it
is
altogether
different
to
what
you
find
beyond
the
andes
towards
the
atlantic
you
do
mean
that
we
are
going
to
cross
the
andes
said
dick
in
sudden
alarm
harris
smiled
no
no
indeed
with
our
limited
means
of
transport
such
an
undertaking
would
have
been
rash
in
the
extreme
we
had
better
have
kept
to
the
coast
for
ever
rather
than
incur
such
a
risk
our
destination
san
felice
is
on
this
side
of
the
range
and
in
order
to
reach
it
we
shall
not
have
to
leave
the
plateau
of
which
the
greatest
elevation
is
but
little
over
feet
and
you
say
dick
persisted
that
you
have
really
no
fear
of
losing
your
way
in
a
forest
such
as
this
a
forest
into
which
you
have
never
set
foot
before
no
fear
whatever
harris
answered
so
accustomed
am
i
to
travelling
of
this
kind
that
i
can
steer
my
way
by
a
thousand
signs
revealing
themselves
in
the
growth
of
the
trees
and
in
the
composition
of
the
soil
which
would
never
present
themselves
to
your
notice
i
assure
you
that
i
anticipate
no
difficulties
this
conversation
was
not
heard
by
any
of
the
rest
of
the
party
harris
seemed
to
speak
as
frankly
as
he
did
fearlessly
and
dick
felt
that
there
might
be
after
all
no
just
grounds
for
any
of
his
own
misgivings
five
days
passed
by
and
the
of
april
arrived
without
any
special
incident
nine
miles
had
been
the
average
distance
accomplished
in
a
day
regular
periods
of
rest
had
been
taken
and
except
that
spirits
had
somewhat
flagged
the
fatigue
did
not
seem
to
have
interfered
with
the
general
good
health
of
the
travellers
first
disappointed
of
his
and
then
of
his
humming
birds
jack
had
inquired
about
the
beautiful
parrots
which
he
had
been
led
to
expect
he
should
see
in
this
wonderful
forest
where
were
the
bright
green
macaws
where
were
the
gaudy
aras
with
their
bare
white
cheeks
and
pointed
tails
which
seem
never
to
light
upon
the
ground
and
where
too
were
all
the
brilliant
parroquets
with
their
feathered
faces
and
indeed
the
whole
variety
of
those
forest
chatterers
of
which
the
indians
affirm
that
they
speak
the
language
of
nations
long
extinct
it
is
true
that
there
was
no
lack
of
the
common
grey
parrots
with
crimson
tails
but
these
were
no
novelty
jack
had
seen
plenty
of
them
before
for
owing
to
their
reputation
of
being
the
most
clever
in
mimickry
of
the
psittacidæ
they
have
been
domesticated
everywhere
in
both
the
old
and
new
worlds
illustration
do
fire
but
jack
dissatisfaction
was
nothing
compared
to
cousin
benedict
in
spite
of
being
allowed
to
wander
away
from
the
rank
he
had
failed
to
discover
a
single
insect
which
was
worth
the
pursuit
not
even
a
danced
at
night
nature
seemed
to
be
mocking
him
and
his
increased
accordingly
in
this
way
the
journey
was
continued
for
four
days
longer
and
on
the
it
was
estimated
that
they
must
have
travelled
between
eighty
and
ninety
miles
from
the
coast
harris
positively
asserted
that
they
could
not
be
much
more
than
twenty
miles
from
san
felice
and
that
by
pushing
forwards
they
might
expect
in
hours
to
find
themselves
lodged
in
comfortable
quarters
but
although
they
had
thus
succeeded
in
traversing
this
vast
they
had
not
seen
one
human
inhabitant
dick
was
more
than
ever
perplexed
and
it
was
a
subject
of
bitter
regret
to
him
that
they
had
not
stranded
upon
some
more
frequented
part
of
the
shore
near
some
village
or
plantation
where
weldon
might
long
since
have
found
a
suitable
refuge
deserted
however
as
the
country
apparently
was
by
man
it
had
latterly
shown
itself
much
more
abundantly
tenanted
by
animals
many
a
time
a
long
plaintive
cry
was
heard
which
harris
attributed
to
the
tardigrades
or
sloths
often
found
in
wooded
districts
and
known
by
the
name
of
ais
and
in
the
middle
of
the
on
this
day
a
loud
hissing
suddenly
broke
upon
the
air
which
made
weldon
start
to
her
feet
in
alarm
a
serpent
cried
dick
catching
up
his
loaded
gun
the
negroes
following
dick
example
were
in
a
moment
on
the
alert
do
fire
cried
harris
there
was
indeed
nothing
improbable
in
the
supposition
that
a
sucuru
a
species
of
boa
sometimes
measuring
forty
feet
in
length
had
just
moved
itself
in
the
long
grass
at
their
side
but
harris
affirmed
that
the
sucuru
never
hisses
and
declared
that
the
noise
had
really
come
from
animals
of
an
entirely
inoffensive
character
what
animals
asked
dick
always
eager
for
information
which
it
must
be
granted
harris
seemed
always
equally
anxious
to
give
antelopes
replied
harris
but
hush
not
a
sound
or
you
will
frighten
them
away
antelopes
cried
dick
i
must
see
them
i
must
get
close
to
them
more
easily
said
than
done
answered
harris
shaking
his
head
but
dick
was
not
to
be
diverted
from
his
purpose
and
gun
in
hand
crept
into
the
grass
he
had
not
advanced
many
yards
before
a
herd
of
about
a
dozen
gazelles
graceful
in
body
with
short
pointed
horns
dashed
past
him
like
a
glowing
cloud
and
disappeared
in
the
underwood
without
giving
him
time
to
take
a
shot
i
told
you
beforehand
what
you
would
have
to
expect
said
harris
as
dick
with
a
considerable
sense
of
disappointment
returned
to
the
party
impossible
however
as
it
had
been
fairly
to
scrutinize
the
antelopes
such
was
hardly
the
case
with
another
herd
of
animals
the
identification
of
which
led
to
a
somewhat
singular
discussion
between
harris
and
the
rest
about
four
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
the
travellers
were
halting
for
a
few
moments
near
an
opening
in
the
forest
when
three
or
four
large
animals
emerged
from
a
thicket
about
a
hundred
paces
ahead
and
scampered
off
at
full
speed
in
spite
of
what
harris
had
urged
dick
put
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
was
on
the
very
point
of
firing
when
harris
knocked
the
rifle
quickly
aside
they
were
giraffes
shouted
dick
the
announcement
awakened
the
curiosity
of
jack
who
quickly
scrambled
to
his
feet
upon
the
saddle
on
which
he
was
lounging
my
dear
dick
said
weldon
there
are
no
giraffes
in
america
illustration
a
herd
of
gazelles
dashed
past
him
like
a
glowing
cloud
certainly
not
cried
harris
they
were
not
giraffes
they
were
ostriches
which
you
saw
ostriches
with
four
legs
that
will
never
do
what
do
you
say
mrs
weldon
weldon
replied
that
she
had
certainly
taken
the
animals
for
quadrupeds
and
all
the
negroes
were
under
the
same
impression
laughing
heartily
harris
said
it
was
far
from
an
uncommon
thing
for
an
inexperienced
eye
to
mistake
a
large
ostrich
for
a
small
giraffe
the
shape
of
both
was
so
similar
that
it
often
quite
escaped
observation
as
to
whether
the
long
necks
terminated
in
a
beak
or
a
muzzle
besides
what
need
of
discussion
could
there
be
when
the
fact
was
established
that
giraffes
are
unknown
in
the
new
world
the
reasoning
was
plausible
enough
and
mrs
weldon
and
the
negroes
were
soon
convinced
but
dick
was
far
from
satisfied
i
did
not
know
that
there
was
an
american
ostrich
he
again
objected
oh
yes
replied
harris
promptly
there
is
a
species
called
the
nandu
which
is
very
well
known
here
we
shall
probably
see
some
more
of
them
the
statement
was
correct
the
nandu
is
common
in
the
plains
of
south
america
and
is
distinguished
from
the
african
ostrich
by
having
three
toes
all
furnished
with
claws
it
is
a
fine
bird
sometimes
exceeding
six
feet
in
height
it
has
a
short
beak
and
its
wings
are
furnished
with
plumes
harris
appeared
well
acquainted
with
the
bird
and
proceeded
to
give
a
very
precise
account
of
its
habits
in
concluding
his
remarks
he
again
pressed
upon
dick
his
most
urgent
request
that
he
should
abstain
from
firing
upon
any
animal
whatever
it
was
of
the
utmost
consequence
dick
made
no
reply
he
was
silent
and
thoughtful
grave
doubts
had
arisen
in
his
mind
and
he
could
neither
explain
nor
dispel
them
when
the
march
was
resumed
on
the
following
day
harris
asserted
his
conviction
that
another
hours
would
bring
them
to
the
hacienda
and
there
madam
he
said
addressing
weldon
we
can
offer
you
every
essential
comfort
though
you
may
not
find
the
luxuries
of
your
own
home
in
san
francisco
weldon
repeated
her
expression
of
gratitude
for
the
proffered
hospitality
owning
that
she
should
now
be
exceedingly
glad
to
reach
the
farm
as
she
was
anxious
about
her
little
son
who
appeared
to
be
threatened
with
the
symptoms
of
incipient
fever
harris
could
not
deny
that
although
the
climate
was
usually
very
healthy
it
nevertheless
did
occasionally
produce
a
kind
of
intermittent
fever
during
march
and
april
but
nature
has
provided
the
proper
remedy
said
dick
and
perceiving
that
harris
did
not
comprehend
his
meaning
he
continued
are
we
not
in
the
region
of
the
quinquinas
the
bark
of
which
is
notoriously
the
medicine
with
which
attacks
of
fever
are
usually
treated
for
my
part
i
am
amazed
that
we
have
not
seen
numbers
of
them
already
ah
yes
yes
i
know
what
you
mean
answered
harris
after
a
hesitation
they
are
trees
however
not
always
easy
to
find
they
rarely
grow
in
groups
and
in
spite
of
their
large
leaves
and
fragrant
red
blossom
the
indians
themselves
often
have
a
difficulty
in
recognizing
them
the
feature
that
distinguishes
them
most
is
their
evergreen
foliage
at
weldon
request
harris
promised
to
point
out
the
tree
if
he
should
see
one
but
added
that
when
she
reached
the
hacienda
she
would
be
able
to
obtain
some
sulphate
of
quinine
which
was
much
more
efficacious
than
the
unprepared
bark
footnote
this
bark
was
formerly
reduced
to
powder
known
as
pulvis
jesuiticus
because
in
the
year
the
jesuits
in
rome
imported
a
large
quantity
of
it
from
their
missionaries
in
south
america
the
day
passed
without
further
incident
no
rain
had
fallen
at
present
though
the
warm
mist
that
rose
from
the
soil
betokened
an
approaching
change
of
weather
the
rainy
season
was
certainly
not
far
distant
but
to
travellers
who
indulged
the
expectation
of
being
in
a
few
hours
in
a
place
of
shelter
this
was
not
a
matter
of
great
concern
illustration
a
halt
was
made
for
the
night
beneath
a
grove
of
lofty
trees
evening
came
and
a
halt
was
made
for
the
night
beneath
a
grove
of
lofty
trees
if
harris
had
not
miscalculated
they
could
hardly
be
more
than
about
six
miles
from
their
destination
so
confirmed
however
was
dick
sands
in
his
strange
suspicions
that
nothing
could
induce
him
to
relax
any
of
the
usual
precautions
and
he
particularly
insisted
upon
the
negroes
turn
by
turn
keeping
up
the
accustomed
watch
worn
out
by
fatigue
the
little
party
were
glad
to
lie
down
but
they
had
scarcely
dropped
off
to
sleep
when
they
were
aroused
by
a
sharp
cry
who
that
who
there
what
the
matter
exclaimed
dick
the
first
to
rise
to
his
feet
it
is
i
answered
benedict
voice
i
am
bitten
something
has
bitten
me
a
snake
exclaimed
weldon
in
alarm
no
no
cousin
better
than
that
it
was
not
a
snake
i
believe
it
was
an
orthoptera
i
have
it
all
right
he
shouted
triumphantly
then
kill
it
quickly
sir
and
let
us
go
to
sleep
again
in
peace
said
harris
kill
it
not
for
the
world
i
must
have
a
light
and
look
at
it
dick
sands
indulged
him
for
reasons
of
his
own
in
getting
a
light
the
entomologist
carefully
opened
his
hand
and
displayed
an
insect
somewhat
smaller
than
a
bee
of
a
dull
colour
streaked
with
yellow
on
the
under
portion
of
the
body
he
looked
radiant
with
delight
a
diptera
he
exclaimed
half
beside
himself
with
joy
a
most
famous
diptera
is
it
venomous
asked
weldon
not
at
all
to
men
it
only
hurts
elephants
and
buffaloes
but
tell
us
its
name
what
is
it
cried
dick
impetuously
the
naturalist
began
to
speak
in
a
slow
oracular
tone
this
insect
is
here
a
prodigy
it
is
an
insect
totally
unknown
in
this
country
in
america
tell
us
its
name
roared
dick
it
is
a
tzetzy
sir
a
true
tzetzy
dick
heart
sank
like
a
stone
he
was
speechless
he
did
not
dared
not
ask
more
only
too
well
he
knew
where
the
tzetzy
could
alone
be
found
he
did
not
close
his
eyes
again
that
night
chapter
xviii
a
terrible
discovery
the
morning
of
the
dawned
the
day
on
which
according
to
prediction
the
travellers
were
to
be
safely
housed
at
san
felice
weldon
was
really
much
relieved
at
the
prospect
for
she
was
aware
that
her
strength
must
prove
inadequate
to
the
strain
of
a
more
protracted
journey
the
condition
of
her
little
boy
who
was
alternately
flushed
with
fever
and
pale
with
exhaustion
had
begun
to
cause
her
great
anxiety
and
unwilling
to
resign
the
care
of
the
child
even
to
nan
his
faithful
nurse
she
insisted
upon
carrying
him
in
her
own
arms
twelve
days
and
nights
passed
in
the
open
air
had
done
much
to
try
her
powers
of
endurance
and
the
charge
of
a
sick
child
in
addition
would
soon
break
down
her
strength
entirely
dick
sands
nan
and
the
negroes
had
all
borne
the
march
very
fairly
their
stock
of
provisions
though
of
course
considerably
diminished
was
still
far
from
small
as
for
harris
he
had
shown
himself
adapted
for
and
capable
of
bearing
any
amount
of
fatigue
yet
strange
to
say
as
he
approached
the
end
of
the
journey
his
manner
underwent
a
remarkable
change
instead
of
conversing
in
his
ordinary
frank
and
easy
way
he
became
silent
and
preoccupied
as
if
engrossed
in
his
own
thoughts
perhaps
he
had
an
instinctive
consciousness
that
his
young
friend
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
addressing
dick
was
entertaining
hard
suspicions
about
him
the
march
was
resumed
the
trees
once
again
ceased
to
be
crowded
in
impenetrable
masses
but
stood
in
clusters
at
considerable
distances
apart
now
dick
tried
to
argue
with
himself
they
must
be
coming
to
the
true
pampas
or
the
man
must
be
designedly
misleading
them
and
yet
what
motive
could
he
have
although
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
there
occurred
nothing
that
could
be
said
absolutely
to
justify
dick
increasing
uneasiness
two
circumstances
transpired
which
did
not
escape
his
observation
and
which
he
felt
might
be
significant
the
first
of
these
was
a
sudden
change
in
dingo
behaviour
the
dog
throughout
the
march
had
uniformly
run
along
with
his
nose
upon
the
ground
smelling
the
grass
and
shrubs
and
occasionally
uttering
a
sad
low
whine
but
he
seemed
all
agitation
he
scampered
about
with
bristling
coat
with
his
head
erect
and
ever
and
again
burst
into
one
of
those
furious
fits
of
barking
with
which
he
had
formerly
been
accustomed
to
greet
appearance
upon
the
deck
of
the
pilgrim
the
idea
that
flitted
across
dick
mind
was
shared
by
tom
look
dick
look
at
dingo
he
is
at
his
old
ways
again
said
he
it
is
just
as
if
negoro
hush
said
dick
to
the
old
man
who
continued
in
a
lower
voice
it
is
just
as
if
negoro
had
followed
us
do
you
think
it
is
likely
it
might
perhaps
be
to
his
advantage
to
follow
us
if
he
does
know
the
country
but
if
he
does
know
the
country
why
then
dick
did
not
finish
his
sentence
but
whistled
to
dingo
the
dog
reluctantly
obeyed
the
call
as
soon
as
the
dog
was
at
his
side
dick
patted
him
repeating
good
dog
good
dingo
where
negoro
the
sound
of
negoro
name
had
its
usual
effect
it
seemed
to
irritate
the
animal
exceedingly
and
he
barked
furiously
and
apparently
wanted
to
dash
into
the
thicket
harris
had
been
an
interested
spectator
of
the
scene
and
now
approached
with
a
peculiar
expression
on
his
countenance
and
inquired
what
they
were
saying
to
dingo
oh
nothing
much
replied
tom
we
were
only
asking
him
for
news
of
a
lost
acquaintance
ah
i
suppose
you
mean
that
portuguese
cook
of
yours
yes
answered
tom
we
fancied
from
dingo
behaviour
that
negoro
must
be
somewhere
close
at
hand
why
do
you
send
and
search
the
underwood
perhaps
the
poor
wretch
is
in
distress
no
need
of
that
harris
negoro
i
have
no
doubt
is
quite
capable
of
taking
care
of
himself
well
just
as
you
please
my
young
friend
said
harris
with
an
air
of
indifference
dick
turned
away
he
continued
his
endeavours
to
pacify
dingo
and
the
conversation
dropped
the
other
thing
that
had
arrested
dick
attention
was
the
behaviour
of
the
horse
if
they
had
been
as
near
the
hacienda
as
harris
described
would
not
the
animal
have
pricked
up
its
ears
sniffed
the
air
and
with
dilated
nostril
exhibited
some
sign
of
satisfaction
as
being
upon
familiar
ground
but
nothing
of
the
kind
was
to
be
observed
the
horse
plodded
along
as
unconcernedly
as
if
a
stable
were
as
far
away
as
ever
even
weldon
was
not
so
engrossed
with
her
child
but
what
she
was
fain
to
express
her
wonder
at
the
deserted
aspect
of
the
country
no
trace
of
a
was
anywhere
to
be
seen
she
cast
her
eye
at
harris
who
was
in
his
usual
place
in
front
and
observing
how
he
was
looking
first
to
the
left
and
then
to
the
right
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
uncertain
of
his
path
she
asked
herself
whether
it
was
possible
their
guide
might
have
lost
his
way
she
dared
not
entertain
the
idea
and
averted
her
eyes
that
she
might
not
be
harassed
by
his
movements
after
crossing
an
open
plain
about
a
mile
in
width
the
travellers
once
again
entered
the
forest
which
resumed
something
of
the
same
denseness
that
had
characterized
it
farther
to
the
west
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
they
came
to
a
spot
which
was
marked
very
distinctly
by
the
vestiges
of
some
enormous
animals
which
must
have
passed
quite
recently
as
dick
looked
carefully
about
him
he
observed
that
the
branches
were
all
torn
off
or
broken
to
a
considerable
height
and
that
the
in
the
trampled
grass
were
much
too
large
to
be
those
either
of
jaguars
or
panthers
even
if
it
were
possible
that
the
prints
on
the
ground
had
been
made
by
ais
or
other
taidigrades
this
would
fail
to
account
in
the
least
for
the
trees
being
broken
to
such
a
height
elephants
alone
were
capable
of
working
such
destruction
in
the
underwood
but
elephants
were
unknown
in
america
dick
was
puzzled
but
controlled
himself
so
that
he
would
not
apply
to
harris
for
any
enlightenment
his
intuition
made
him
aware
that
a
man
who
had
once
tried
to
make
him
believe
that
giraffes
were
ostriches
would
not
hesitate
a
second
time
to
impose
upon
his
credulity
more
than
ever
was
dick
becoming
convinced
that
harris
was
a
traitor
and
he
was
secretly
prompted
to
tax
him
with
his
treachery
still
he
was
obliged
to
own
that
he
could
not
assign
any
motive
for
the
man
acting
in
such
a
manner
with
the
survivors
of
the
pilgrim
and
consequently
hesitated
before
he
actually
condemned
him
for
conduct
so
base
and
heartless
what
could
be
done
he
repeatedly
asked
himself
on
board
ship
the
boy
captain
might
perchance
have
been
able
to
devise
some
plan
for
the
safety
of
those
so
strangely
committed
to
his
charge
but
here
on
an
unknown
shore
he
could
only
suffer
from
the
burden
of
this
responsibility
the
more
because
he
was
so
utterly
powerless
to
act
he
made
up
his
mind
on
one
point
he
determined
not
to
alarm
the
poor
anxious
mother
a
moment
before
he
was
actually
compelled
it
was
his
carrying
out
this
determination
that
explained
why
on
subsequently
arriving
at
a
considerable
stream
where
he
saw
some
huge
heads
swollen
muzzles
long
tusks
and
unwieldy
bodies
rising
from
amidst
the
rank
wet
grass
he
uttered
no
word
and
gave
no
gesture
of
surprise
but
only
too
well
he
knew
at
a
glance
that
he
must
be
looking
at
a
herd
of
hippopotamuses
illustration
look
here
here
are
hands
men
hands
it
was
a
weary
march
that
day
a
general
feeling
of
depression
spread
involuntarily
from
one
to
another
hardly
conscious
to
herself
of
her
weariness
weldon
was
exhibiting
manifest
symptoms
of
lassitude
and
it
was
only
dick
moral
energy
and
sense
of
duty
that
kept
him
from
succumbing
to
the
prevailing
dejection
about
four
tom
noticed
something
lying
in
the
grass
and
stooping
down
he
picked
up
a
kind
of
knife
it
was
of
peculiar
shape
being
very
wide
and
flat
in
the
blade
while
its
handle
which
was
of
ivory
was
ornamented
with
a
good
deal
of
clumsy
carving
he
carried
it
at
once
to
dick
who
when
he
had
scrutinized
it
held
it
up
to
harris
with
the
remark
there
must
be
natives
not
far
off
quite
right
my
young
friend
the
hacienda
must
be
a
very
few
miles
away
but
yet
but
yet
he
hesitated
you
do
mean
that
you
are
not
sure
of
your
way
said
dick
sharply
not
exactly
that
replied
harris
yet
in
taking
this
short
cut
across
the
forest
i
am
inclined
to
think
i
am
a
mile
or
so
out
of
the
way
perhaps
i
had
better
walk
on
a
little
way
and
look
about
me
no
you
do
not
leave
us
here
cried
dick
firmly
not
against
your
will
but
remember
i
do
not
undertake
to
guide
you
in
the
dark
we
must
spare
you
the
necessity
for
that
i
can
answer
for
it
that
weldon
will
raise
no
objection
to
spending
another
night
in
the
open
air
we
can
start
off
morning
as
early
as
we
like
and
if
the
distance
be
only
what
you
represent
a
few
hours
will
easily
accomplish
it
as
you
please
answered
harris
with
cold
civility
just
then
dingo
again
burst
out
into
a
vehement
fit
of
barking
and
it
required
no
small
amount
of
coaxing
on
dick
part
to
make
him
cease
from
his
noise
it
was
decided
that
the
halt
should
be
made
at
once
weldon
as
it
had
been
anticipated
urged
nothing
against
it
being
preoccupied
by
her
immediate
attentions
to
jack
who
was
lying
in
her
arms
suffering
from
a
decided
attack
of
fever
the
shelter
of
a
large
thicket
had
just
been
selected
by
dick
as
a
suitable
for
the
night
when
tom
who
was
assisting
in
the
necessary
preparations
suddenly
gave
a
cry
of
horror
what
is
it
tom
asked
dick
very
calmly
look
look
at
these
trees
they
are
spattered
with
blood
and
look
here
here
are
hands
men
hands
cut
off
and
lying
on
the
ground
what
cried
dick
and
in
an
instant
was
at
his
side
his
presence
of
mind
did
not
fail
him
he
whispered
hush
tom
hush
not
a
word
but
it
was
with
a
shudder
that
ran
through
his
veins
that
he
witnessed
for
himself
the
mutilated
fragments
of
several
human
bodies
and
saw
lying
beside
them
some
broken
forks
and
some
bits
of
iron
chain
the
sight
of
the
gory
remains
made
dingo
bark
ferociously
and
dick
who
was
most
anxious
that
weldon
attention
should
not
be
called
to
the
discovery
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
driving
him
back
but
fortunately
the
lady
mind
was
so
engrossed
with
her
patient
that
she
did
not
observe
the
commotion
harris
stood
aloof
there
was
no
one
to
notice
the
change
that
passed
over
his
countenance
but
the
expression
was
almost
diabolical
in
its
malignity
poor
old
tom
himself
seemed
perfectly
with
his
hands
clenched
his
eyes
dilated
and
his
breast
heaving
with
emotion
he
kept
repeating
without
anything
like
coherence
the
words
forks
chains
forks
long
ago
remember
too
well
chains
for
weldon
sake
tom
hold
your
tongue
dick
implored
him
tom
however
was
full
with
some
remembrance
of
the
past
he
continued
to
repeat
long
ago
forks
chains
until
dick
led
him
out
of
hearing
a
fresh
was
chosen
a
short
distance
further
on
and
supper
was
prepared
but
the
meal
was
left
almost
untasted
not
so
much
that
hunger
had
been
overcome
by
fatigue
but
because
the
indefinable
feeling
of
uneasiness
that
had
taken
possession
of
them
all
had
entirely
destroyed
all
appetite
illustration
the
man
was
gone
and
his
horse
with
him
gradually
the
night
became
very
dark
the
sky
was
covered
with
heavy
and
on
the
western
horizon
flashes
of
summer
lightning
now
and
then
glimmered
through
the
trees
the
air
was
perfectly
still
not
a
leaf
stirred
and
the
atmosphere
seemed
so
charged
with
electricity
as
to
be
incapable
of
transmitting
sound
of
any
kind
dick
himself
with
austin
and
bat
in
attendance
remained
on
guard
all
of
them
eagerly
straining
both
eye
and
ear
to
catch
any
light
or
sound
that
might
disturb
the
silence
and
obscurity
old
tom
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
sat
motionless
as
in
a
trance
he
was
gloomily
revolving
the
awakened
memories
of
the
past
weldon
was
engaged
with
her
sick
child
scarcely
one
of
the
party
was
really
asleep
except
indeed
it
might
be
cousin
benedict
whose
reasoning
faculties
were
not
of
an
order
to
carry
him
forwards
into
any
future
contingencies
midnight
was
still
an
hour
in
advance
when
the
dull
air
seemed
filled
with
a
deep
and
prolonged
roar
mingled
with
a
peculiar
kind
of
vibration
tom
started
to
his
feet
a
fresh
recollection
of
his
early
days
had
struck
him
a
lion
a
lion
he
shouted
in
vain
dick
tried
to
repress
him
but
he
repeated
a
lion
a
lion
dick
sands
seized
his
cutlass
and
unable
any
longer
to
control
his
wrath
he
rushed
to
the
spot
where
he
had
left
harris
lying
the
man
was
gone
and
his
horse
with
him
all
the
suspicions
that
had
been
so
long
pent
up
within
dick
mind
now
shaped
themselves
into
actual
reality
a
flood
of
light
had
broken
in
upon
him
now
he
was
convinced
only
too
certainly
that
it
was
not
the
coast
of
america
at
all
upon
which
the
schooner
had
been
cast
ashore
it
was
not
easter
island
that
had
been
sighted
far
away
in
the
west
the
compass
had
completely
deceived
him
he
was
satisfied
now
that
the
strong
currents
had
carried
them
quite
round
cape
horn
and
that
they
had
really
entered
the
atlantic
no
wonder
that
quinquinas
caoutchouc
and
other
south
american
products
had
failed
to
be
seen
this
was
neither
the
bolivian
pampas
nor
the
plateau
of
atacama
they
were
giraffes
not
ostriches
that
had
vanished
down
the
glade
they
were
elephants
that
had
trodden
down
the
underwood
they
were
hippopotamuses
that
were
lurking
by
the
river
it
was
indeed
the
dreaded
tzetsy
that
cousin
benedict
had
so
triumphantly
discovered
and
last
of
all
it
was
a
lion
roar
that
had
disturbed
the
silence
of
the
forest
that
chain
that
knife
those
forks
were
unquestionably
the
instruments
of
and
what
could
those
mutilated
hands
be
except
the
relics
of
their
victims
harris
and
negoro
must
be
in
a
conspiracy
it
was
with
terrible
anguish
that
dick
gnashed
his
teeth
and
muttered
yes
it
is
too
true
we
are
in
africa
in
equatorial
africa
in
the
land
of
slavery

the

it
is
still
largely
carried
on
especially
in
central
africa
inasmuch
as
there
are
several
states
professedly
christian
whose
signatures
have
never
been
affixed
to
the
deed
of
abolition
incredible
as
it
should
seem
this
barter
of
human
beings
still
exists
and
for
the
due
comprehension
of
the
second
part
of
dick
sands
story
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
certain
colonies
with
slaves
there
continue
to
be
prosecuted
such
barbarous
as
threaten
almost
to
lay
waste
an
entire
continent
with
blood
fire
and
pillage
the
nefarious
traffic
as
far
as
regards
negroes
does
not
appear
to
have
arisen
until
the
fifteenth
century
the
following
are
said
to
be
the
circumstances
under
which
it
had
its
origin
after
being
banished
from
spain
the
mussulmans
crossed
the
straits
of
gibraltar
and
took
refuge
upon
the
shores
of
africa
but
the
portuguese
who
then
occupied
that
portion
of
the
coast
persecuted
the
fugitives
with
the
utmost
severity
and
having
captured
them
in
large
numbers
sent
them
as
prisoners
into
portugal
they
were
thus
the
first
nucleus
of
any
african
slaves
that
entered
western
europe
since
the
commencement
of
the
christian
era
the
majority
however
of
these
mussulmans
were
members
of
wealthy
families
who
were
prepared
to
pay
almost
any
amount
of
money
for
their
release
but
no
ransom
was
exorbitant
enough
to
tempt
the
portuguese
to
surrender
them
more
precious
than
gold
were
the
strong
arms
that
should
work
the
resources
of
their
young
and
rising
colonies
thus
baulked
in
their
purpose
of
effecting
a
direct
ransom
of
their
captured
relatives
the
mussulman
families
next
submitted
a
proposition
for
exchanging
them
for
a
larger
number
of
african
negroes
whom
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
procure
the
portuguese
to
whom
the
proposal
was
in
every
way
advantageous
eagerly
accepted
the
offer
and
in
this
way
the
was
originated
in
europe
by
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
this
odious
traffic
had
become
permanently
established
in
principle
it
contained
nothing
repugnant
to
the
thought
and
customs
then
existing
all
the
great
states
recognized
it
as
the
most
effectual
means
of
colonizing
the
islands
of
the
new
world
especially
as
slaves
of
negro
blood
well
acclimatized
to
tropical
heat
were
able
to
survive
where
white
men
must
have
perished
by
thousands
the
transport
of
slaves
to
the
american
colonies
was
consequently
regularly
effected
by
vessels
specially
built
for
that
purpose
and
large
dépôts
for
this
branch
of
commerce
were
established
at
various
points
of
the
african
coast
the
goods
cost
comparatively
little
in
production
and
the
profits
were
enormous
yet
after
all
however
indispensable
it
might
be
to
complete
the
foundation
of
the
colonies
there
was
nothing
to
justify
this
shameful
barter
of
human
flesh
and
blood
and
the
voice
of
philanthropy
began
to
be
heard
in
protestation
calling
upon
all
european
governments
in
the
name
of
mercy
and
common
humanity
to
decree
the
abolition
of
the
trade
at
once
in
the
quakers
put
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
abolitionist
movement
in
north
america
that
very
land
where
a
hundred
years
later
the
war
of
secession
burst
forth
in
which
the
question
of
slavery
bore
the
most
conspicuous
part
several
of
the
northern
states
virginia
connecticut
massachusetts
and
pennsylvania
prohibited
the
trade
liberating
the
slaves
in
spite
of
the
cost
who
had
been
imported
into
their
territories
the
campaign
thus
commenced
was
not
limited
to
a
few
provinces
of
the
new
world
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
too
the
partisans
of
slavery
were
subject
to
a
vigourous
attack
england
and
france
led
the
van
and
energetically
beat
up
recruits
to
serve
the
righteous
cause
let
us
lose
our
colonies
rather
than
sacrifice
our
principles
was
the
magnanimous
watchword
that
resounded
throughout
europe
and
notwithstanding
the
vast
political
and
commercial
interests
involved
in
the
question
it
did
not
go
forth
in
vain
a
living
impulse
had
been
communicated
to
the
in
england
formally
prohibited
the
in
her
colonies
france
following
her
example
in
the
two
great
nations
then
entered
upon
a
treaty
on
the
subject
which
was
confirmed
by
napoleon
during
the
hundred
days
hitherto
however
the
declaration
was
purely
theoretical
continued
to
ply
their
illicit
trade
discharging
their
living
cargo
at
many
a
colonial
port
it
was
evident
that
more
resolute
and
practical
measures
must
be
taken
to
impress
the
enormity
accordingly
the
united
states
in
and
great
britain
in
declared
the
to
be
an
act
of
piracy
and
its
perpetrators
to
be
punishable
with
death
france
soon
gave
in
her
adherence
to
the
new
treaty
but
the
southern
states
of
america
and
the
spanish
and
portuguese
not
having
signed
the
act
of
abolition
continued
the
importation
of
slaves
at
a
great
profit
and
this
in
defiance
of
the
recognized
reciprocal
right
of
visitation
to
verify
the
flags
of
suspected
ships
but
although
the
by
these
measures
was
in
a
considerable
measure
reduced
it
continued
to
exist
new
slaves
were
not
allowed
but
the
old
ones
did
not
recover
their
liberty
england
was
now
the
first
to
set
a
noble
example
on
the
of
may
an
act
of
parliament
by
a
munificent
vote
of
millions
of
pounds
emancipated
all
the
negroes
in
the
british
colonies
and
in
august
slaves
were
declared
free
men
ten
years
later
in
the
french
republic
liberated
the
slaves
in
her
colonies
to
the
number
of
and
in
the
war
which
broke
out
between
the
federals
and
confederates
in
the
united
states
finished
the
work
of
emancipation
by
extending
it
to
the
whole
of
north
america
thus
three
great
powers
have
accomplished
their
task
of
humanity
and
at
the
present
time
the
is
carried
on
only
for
the
advantage
of
the
spanish
and
portuguese
colonies
or
to
supply
the
requirements
of
the
turkish
or
arab
populations
of
the
east
brazil
although
she
has
not
emancipated
her
former
slaves
does
not
receive
any
new
and
all
negro
children
are
pronounced
in
contrast
however
to
all
this
it
is
not
to
be
concealed
that
in
the
interior
of
africa
as
the
result
of
wars
between
chieftains
waged
for
the
sole
object
of
making
captives
entire
tribes
are
often
reduced
to
slavery
and
are
carried
off
in
caravans
in
two
opposite
directions
some
westwards
to
the
portuguese
colony
of
angola
others
eastwards
to
mozambique
of
these
miserable
creatures
of
whom
a
very
small
proportion
ever
reach
their
destination
some
are
despatched
to
cuba
or
madagascar
others
to
the
arab
or
turkish
provinces
of
asia
to
mecca
or
muscat
the
french
and
english
cruisers
have
practically
very
little
power
to
control
the
iniquitous
proceedings
because
the
extent
of
coast
to
be
watched
is
so
large
that
a
strict
and
adequate
surveillance
can
not
be
maintained
the
extent
of
the
odious
export
is
very
considerable
no
less
than
slaves
annually
reach
the
coast
a
number
that
hardly
represents
a
tenth
part
of
those
who
are
massacred
or
otherwise
perish
by
a
deplorable
end
after
the
frightful
butcheries
the
fields
lie
devastated
the
smouldering
villages
are
void
of
inhabitants
the
rivers
reek
with
bleeding
corpses
and
wild
beasts
take
undisputed
possession
of
the
soil
livingstone
upon
returning
to
a
district
immediately
after
one
of
these
ruthless
raids
said
that
he
could
never
have
recognized
it
for
the
same
that
he
had
visited
only
a
few
months
previously
and
all
other
travellers
grant
speke
burton
cameron
stanley
describe
the
wooded
plateau
of
central
africa
as
the
principal
theatre
of
the
barbarous
warfare
between
chief
and
chief
in
the
region
of
the
great
lakes
throughout
the
vast
district
which
feeds
the
market
of
zanzibar
in
bornu
and
fezzan
further
south
on
the
banks
of
the
nyassa
and
zambesi
further
west
in
the
districts
of
the
upper
zaire
just
traversed
by
the
intrepid
stanley
everywhere
there
is
the
recurrence
of
the
same
scenes
of
ruin
slaughter
and
devastation
ever
and
again
the
question
seems
to
be
forced
upon
the
mind
whether
slavery
is
not
to
end
in
the
entire
annihilation
of
the
negro
race
so
that
like
the
australian
tribes
of
south
holland
it
will
become
extinct
who
can
doubt
that
the
day
must
dawn
which
will
herald
the
closing
of
the
markets
in
the
spanish
and
portuguese
colonies
a
day
when
civilized
nations
shall
no
longer
tolerate
the
perpetration
of
this
barbarous
wrong
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
another
year
ought
to
witness
the
emancipation
of
every
slave
in
the
possession
of
christian
states
it
seems
only
too
likely
that
for
years
to
come
the
mussulman
nations
will
continue
to
depopulate
the
continent
of
africa
to
them
is
due
the
chief
emigration
of
the
natives
who
torn
from
their
provinces
are
sent
to
the
eastern
coast
in
numbers
that
exceed
annually
long
before
the
egyptian
expedition
the
natives
of
sennaar
were
sold
to
the
natives
of
darfur
and
and
even
napoleon
buonaparte
purchased
a
considerable
number
of
negroes
whom
he
organized
into
regiments
after
the
fashion
of
the
mamelukes
altogether
it
may
be
affirmed
that
although
of
the
present
century
have
passed
away
in
africa
has
been
increased
rather
than
diminished
the
truth
is
that
islamism
really
nurtures
the
in
mussulman
provinces
the
black
slave
has
taken
the
place
of
the
white
slave
of
former
times
dealers
of
the
most
questionable
character
bear
their
part
in
the
execrable
business
bringing
a
supplementary
population
to
races
which
unregenerated
by
their
own
labour
would
otherwise
diminish
and
ultimately
disappear
as
in
the
time
of
buonaparte
these
slaves
often
become
soldiers
on
the
upper
niger
for
instance
they
still
form
half
the
army
of
certain
chieftains
under
circumstances
in
which
their
lot
is
hardly
if
at
all
inferior
to
that
of
free
men
elsewhere
where
the
slave
is
not
a
soldier
he
counts
merely
as
current
coin
and
in
bornu
and
even
in
egypt
we
are
told
by
william
lejean
an
that
officers
and
other
functionaries
have
received
their
pay
in
this
form
such
then
appears
to
be
the
present
actual
condition
of
the
and
it
is
stern
justice
that
compels
the
additional
statement
that
there
are
representatives
of
certain
great
european
powers
who
still
favour
the
unholy
traffic
with
an
indulgent
connivance
and
whilst
cruisers
are
watching
the
coasts
of
the
atlantic
and
of
the
indian
ocean
kidnapping
goes
on
regularly
in
the
interior
caravans
pass
along
under
the
very
eyes
of
certain
officials
and
massacres
are
perpetrated
in
which
frequently
ten
negroes
are
sacrificed
in
the
capture
of
a
single
slave
it
was
the
knowledge
more
or
less
complete
of
all
this
that
wrung
from
dick
sands
his
bitter
and
cry
we
are
in
africa
in
the
very
haunt
of
too
true
it
was
that
he
found
himself
and
his
companions
in
a
land
fraught
with
such
frightful
peril
he
could
only
tremble
when
he
wondered
on
what
part
of
the
fatal
continent
the
pilgrim
had
stranded
evidently
it
was
at
some
point
of
the
west
coast
and
he
had
every
reason
to
fear
that
it
was
on
the
shores
of
angola
the
rendezvous
for
all
the
caravans
that
journey
in
that
portion
of
africa
his
conjecture
was
correct
he
really
was
in
the
very
country
that
a
few
years
later
and
with
gigantic
effort
was
to
be
traversed
by
cameron
in
the
south
and
stanley
in
the
north
of
the
vast
territory
with
its
three
provinces
congo
angola
and
benguela
little
was
then
known
except
the
coast
it
extends
from
the
zaire
on
the
north
to
the
nourse
on
the
south
and
its
chief
towns
are
the
ports
of
benguela
and
of
paul
de
loanda
the
capital
of
the
colony
which
is
a
dependency
of
the
kingdom
of
portugal
the
interior
of
the
country
had
been
almost
entirely
unexplored
very
few
were
the
travellers
who
had
cared
to
venture
far
inland
for
an
unhealthy
climate
a
hot
damp
soil
conducive
to
fever
a
permanent
warfare
between
the
native
tribes
some
of
which
are
cannibals
and
the
of
the
against
any
stranger
who
might
endeavour
to
discover
the
secrets
of
their
infamous
craft
all
combine
to
render
the
region
one
of
the
most
hazardous
in
the
whole
of
equatorial
africa
it
was
in
that
tuckey
ascended
the
congo
as
far
as
the
yellala
falls
a
distance
not
exceeding
miles
but
the
journey
was
too
short
to
give
an
accurate
idea
of
the
interior
of
the
country
and
moreover
cost
the
lives
of
nearly
all
the
officers
and
scientific
men
connected
with
the
expedition
years
afterwards
livingstone
had
advanced
from
the
cape
of
good
hope
to
the
upper
zambesi
thence
with
a
fearlessness
hitherto
unrivalled
he
crossed
the
coango
an
affluent
of
the
congo
and
after
having
traversed
the
continent
from
the
extreme
south
to
the
east
he
reached
paul
de
loanda
on
the
of
may
the
first
explorer
of
the
unknown
portions
of
the
great
portuguese
colony
eighteen
years
elapsed
and
two
other
bold
travellers
crossed
the
entire
continent
from
east
to
west
and
after
encountering
unparalleled
difficulties
emerged
the
one
to
the
south
the
other
to
the
north
of
angola
the
first
of
these
was
verney
lovett
cameron
a
lieutenant
in
the
british
navy
in
when
serious
doubts
were
entertained
as
to
the
safety
of
the
expedition
sent
out
under
stanley
to
the
relief
of
livingstone
in
the
great
lake
district
lieutenant
cameron
volunteered
to
go
out
in
search
of
the
noble
missionary
explorer
his
offer
was
accepted
and
accompanied
by
dillon
lieutenant
cecil
murphy
and
robert
moffat
a
nephew
of
livingstone
he
started
from
zanzibar
having
passed
through
ugogo
he
met
livingstone
corpse
which
was
being
borne
to
the
eastern
coast
by
his
faithful
followers
unshaken
in
his
resolve
to
make
his
way
right
across
the
continent
cameron
still
pushed
onwards
to
the
west
he
passed
through
unyanyembe
and
uganda
and
reached
kawele
where
he
secured
all
livingstone
papers
after
exploring
lake
tanganyika
he
crossed
the
mountains
of
bambarre
and
finding
himself
unable
to
descend
the
course
of
the
lualaba
he
traversed
the
provinces
devastated
and
depopulated
by
war
and
the
kilemba
urua
the
sources
of
the
lomami
ulanda
and
lovalé
and
having
crossed
the
coanza
he
sighted
the
atlantic
and
reached
the
port
of
philip
de
benguela
after
a
journey
that
had
occupied
three
years
and
five
months
cameron
two
companions
dillon
and
robert
moffat
both
succumbed
to
the
hardships
of
the
expedition
the
intrepid
englishman
was
soon
to
be
followed
into
the
field
by
an
american
henry
moreland
stanley
it
is
universally
known
how
the
undaunted
correspondent
of
the
york
having
been
despatched
in
search
of
livingstone
found
the
veteran
missionary
at
ujiji
on
the
borders
of
lake
tanganyika
on
the
of
october
but
what
he
had
undertaken
in
the
course
of
humanity
stanley
longed
to
continue
in
the
interests
of
science
his
prime
object
being
to
make
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
lualaba
of
which
in
his
first
expedition
he
had
only
been
able
to
get
a
partial
and
imperfect
survey
accordingly
whilst
cameron
was
still
deep
in
the
provinces
of
central
africa
stanley
started
from
bagamoyo
in
november
months
later
he
quitted
ujiji
which
had
been
decimated
by
and
in
days
accomplished
the
passage
of
the
lake
and
reached
nyangwe
a
great
previously
visited
both
by
livingstone
and
cameron
he
was
also
present
at
some
of
the
horrible
razzias
perpetrated
by
the
officers
of
the
sultan
of
zanzibar
in
the
districts
of
the
marunzu
and
manyuema
in
order
to
be
in
a
position
to
descend
the
lualaba
to
its
very
mouth
stanley
engaged
at
nyangwe
porters
and
nineteen
boats
difficulties
arose
from
the
very
outset
and
not
only
had
he
to
contend
with
the
cannibals
of
ugusu
but
in
order
to
avoid
many
unnavigable
cataracts
he
had
to
convey
his
boats
many
miles
by
land
near
the
equator
just
at
the
point
where
the
lualaba
turns
stanley
little
convoy
was
attacked
by
a
fleet
of
boats
manned
by
several
hundred
natives
whom
however
he
succeeded
in
putting
to
flight
nothing
daunted
the
resolute
american
pushed
on
to
lat
and
ascertained
beyond
room
for
doubt
that
the
lualaba
was
really
the
upper
zaire
or
congo
and
that
by
following
its
course
he
should
come
directly
to
the
sea
beset
with
many
perils
was
the
way
stanley
was
in
almost
daily
collision
with
the
various
tribes
upon
the
on
the
of
june
he
lost
one
of
his
companions
frank
pocock
at
the
passage
of
the
cataracts
of
massassa
and
on
the
of
july
he
was
himself
carried
in
his
boat
into
the
mbelo
falls
and
escaped
by
little
short
of
a
miracle
on
the
of
august
the
daring
adventurer
arrived
at
the
village
of
ni
sanda
only
four
days
from
the
sea
two
days
later
he
received
a
supply
of
provisions
that
had
been
sent
by
two
emboma
merchants
to
banza
the
little
where
after
a
journey
of
two
years
and
nine
months
fraught
with
every
kind
of
hardship
and
privation
he
completed
his
transit
of
the
mighty
continent
his
toil
told
at
least
temporarily
upon
his
years
but
he
had
the
grand
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
he
had
traced
the
whole
course
of
the
lualaba
and
had
ascertained
beyond
reach
of
question
that
as
the
nile
is
the
great
artery
of
the
north
and
the
zambesi
of
the
east
so
africa
possesses
in
the
west
a
third
great
river
which
in
a
course
of
no
less
than
miles
under
the
names
of
the
lualaba
zaire
and
congo
unites
the
lake
district
with
the
atlantic
ocean
in
however
the
date
at
which
the
pilgrim
foundered
upon
the
coast
very
little
was
known
of
the
province
of
angola
except
that
it
was
the
scene
of
the
western
of
which
the
markets
of
bihé
cassanga
and
kazunde
were
the
chief
centres
this
was
the
country
in
which
dick
sands
now
found
himself
a
hundred
miles
from
shore
in
charge
of
a
lady
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
anxiety
a
child
and
a
band
of
negroes
who
would
be
a
most
tempting
bait
to
the
his
last
illusion
was
completely
dispelled
he
had
no
longer
the
faintest
hope
that
he
was
in
america
that
land
where
little
was
to
be
dreaded
from
either
native
wild
beast
or
climate
he
could
no
more
cherish
the
fond
impression
that
he
might
be
in
the
pleasant
region
between
the
cordilleras
and
the
coast
where
villages
are
numerous
and
missions
afford
hospitable
shelter
to
every
traveller
far
far
away
were
those
provinces
of
bolivia
and
peru
to
which
unless
a
criminal
hand
had
interposed
the
pilgrim
would
certainly
have
sped
her
way
no
too
truly
this
was
the
terrible
province
of
angola
and
worse
than
all
not
the
district
near
the
coast
under
the
surveillance
of
the
portuguese
authorities
but
the
interior
of
the
country
traversed
only
by
slave
caravans
driven
under
the
lash
of
the
havildars
limited
in
one
sense
was
the
knowledge
that
dick
sands
possessed
of
this
land
of
horrors
but
he
had
read
the
accounts
that
had
been
given
by
the
missionaries
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
by
the
portuguese
traders
who
frequented
the
route
from
paul
de
loanda
by
san
salvador
to
the
zaire
as
well
as
by
livingstone
in
his
travels
in
and
consequently
he
knew
enough
to
awaken
immediate
and
complete
despair
in
any
spirit
less
indomitable
than
his
own
anyhow
his
position
was
truly
appalling
illustration
they
were
seated
at
the
foot
of
an
enormous
chapter
ii
accomplices
on
the
day
following
that
on
which
dick
sands
and
his
party
had
made
their
last
halt
in
the
forest
two
men
met
by
appointment
at
a
spot
about
three
miles
distant
the
two
men
were
harris
and
negoro
the
one
lately
landed
from
new
zealand
the
other
pursuing
his
wonted
occupation
of
in
the
province
of
angola
they
were
seated
at
the
foot
of
an
enormous
on
the
banks
of
a
rushing
torrent
that
streamed
between
tall
borders
of
papyrus
after
the
conversation
had
turned
awhile
upon
the
events
of
the
last
few
hours
negoro
said
abruptly
could
you
manage
to
get
that
young
any
farther
into
the
interior
no
indeed
it
was
a
hard
matter
enough
to
bring
him
thus
far
for
the
last
few
days
his
suspicions
have
been
wide
awake
but
just
another
hundred
miles
you
know
continued
negoro
would
have
finished
the
business
off
well
and
those
black
fellows
would
have
been
ours
to
a
dead
certainty
do
i
tell
you
my
dear
fellow
that
it
was
more
than
time
for
me
to
give
them
the
slip
replied
harris
shrugging
his
shoulders
only
too
well
i
knew
that
our
young
friend
was
longing
to
put
a
shot
into
my
body
and
that
was
a
i
might
not
be
able
to
digest
the
portuguese
gave
a
grunt
of
assent
and
harris
went
on
for
several
days
i
succeeded
well
enough
i
managed
to
palm
off
the
country
as
the
forest
of
atacama
which
you
may
recollect
i
once
visited
but
when
the
youngster
began
to
ask
for
and
and
his
mother
wanted
and
when
that
old
fool
of
a
cousin
was
bent
on
finding
cocuyos
i
was
rather
nonplussed
one
day
i
had
to
swear
that
giraffes
were
ostriches
but
the
young
captain
did
not
seem
to
swallow
the
dose
at
all
easily
then
we
saw
traces
of
elephants
and
hippopotamuses
which
of
course
are
as
often
seen
in
america
as
an
honest
man
in
a
benguela
penitentiary
then
that
old
nigger
tom
discovered
a
lot
of
forks
and
chains
left
by
some
runaway
slaves
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
but
when
last
of
all
a
lion
roared
and
the
noise
you
know
is
rather
louder
than
the
mewing
of
a
cat
i
thought
it
was
time
to
take
my
horse
and
decamp
negoro
repeated
his
expression
of
regret
that
the
whole
party
had
not
been
carried
another
hundred
miles
into
the
province
it
really
can
not
be
helped
rejoined
the
american
i
have
done
the
best
i
could
and
i
think
mate
he
added
confidentially
that
you
have
done
wisely
in
following
the
caravan
at
a
good
distance
that
dog
of
theirs
evidently
owes
you
a
grudge
and
might
prove
an
ugly
customer
i
shall
put
a
bullet
into
that
beast
head
before
long
growled
negoro
take
care
you
do
get
one
through
your
own
first
laughed
harris
that
young
sands
i
warn
you
is
a
shot
and
between
ourselves
is
rather
a
fine
fellow
of
his
kind
fine
fellow
indeed
sneered
negoro
whatever
he
is
he
is
a
young
upstart
and
i
have
a
long
score
to
wipe
off
against
him
and
as
he
spoke
an
expression
of
the
utmost
malignity
passed
over
his
countenance
harris
smiled
well
mate
he
said
your
travels
have
not
improved
your
temper
i
see
but
come
now
tell
me
what
you
have
been
doing
all
this
time
when
i
found
you
just
after
the
wreck
at
the
mouth
of
the
longa
you
had
only
time
to
ask
me
to
get
this
party
somehow
or
other
up
into
the
country
but
it
is
just
upon
two
years
since
you
left
cassange
with
that
caravan
of
slaves
for
our
old
master
alvez
what
have
you
been
doing
since
the
last
i
heard
of
you
was
that
you
had
run
foul
of
an
english
cruiser
and
that
you
were
condemned
to
be
hanged
so
i
was
very
nearly
muttered
negoro
ah
well
that
will
come
sooner
or
later
rejoined
the
american
with
philosophic
indifference
men
of
our
trade
ca
expect
to
die
quietly
in
our
beds
you
know
but
were
you
caught
by
the
english
no
by
the
portuguese
before
you
had
got
rid
of
your
cargo
negoro
hesitated
a
moment
before
replying
no
he
said
presently
and
added
the
portuguese
have
changed
their
game
for
a
long
time
they
carried
on
the
trade
themselves
but
now
they
have
got
wonderfully
particular
so
i
was
caught
and
condemned
to
end
my
days
in
the
penitentiary
at
paul
de
loanda
confound
it
exclaimed
harris
a
hundred
times
better
be
hanged
i
not
so
sure
of
that
the
portuguese
replied
for
when
i
had
been
at
the
galleys
about
a
fortnight
i
managed
to
escape
and
got
into
the
hold
of
an
english
steamer
bound
for
new
zealand
i
wedged
myself
in
between
a
cask
of
water
and
a
case
of
preserved
meat
and
so
managed
to
exist
for
a
month
it
was
close
quarters
i
can
tell
you
but
i
preferred
to
travel
incognito
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
being
handed
over
again
to
the
authorities
at
loanda
well
done
exclaimed
the
american
and
so
you
had
a
free
passage
to
the
land
of
the
maoris
but
you
did
come
back
in
the
same
fashion
no
i
always
had
a
hankering
to
be
here
again
at
my
old
trade
but
for
a
year
and
a
half
he
stopped
abruptly
and
grasped
harris
by
the
arm
hush
he
whispered
did
you
hear
a
rustling
in
that
clump
of
papyrus
in
a
moment
harris
had
caught
up
his
loaded
gun
and
both
men
starting
to
their
feet
looked
anxiously
around
them
it
was
nothing
said
harris
presently
the
stream
is
swollen
by
the
storm
that
is
all
your
two
years
travelling
has
made
you
forget
the
sounds
of
the
forest
mate
sit
down
again
and
go
on
with
your
story
when
i
know
the
past
i
shall
be
better
able
to
talk
about
the
future
they
reseated
themselves
and
negoro
went
on
for
a
whole
year
and
a
half
i
vegetated
at
auckland
i
left
the
hold
of
the
steamer
without
a
dollar
in
my
pocket
and
had
to
turn
my
hand
to
every
trade
imaginable
in
order
to
get
a
living
poor
fellow
i
daresay
you
even
tried
the
trade
of
being
an
honest
man
put
in
the
american
just
so
said
negoro
and
in
course
of
time
the
the
vessel
by
which
i
came
here
put
in
at
auckland
while
she
was
waiting
to
take
weldon
and
her
party
on
board
i
applied
to
the
captain
for
a
post
for
i
was
once
mate
on
board
a
slaver
and
know
something
of
seamanship
the
crew
was
complete
but
fortunately
the
ship
cook
had
just
deserted
i
offered
to
supply
his
place
in
default
of
better
my
services
were
accepted
and
in
a
few
days
we
were
out
of
sight
of
new
zealand
i
have
heard
something
about
the
voyage
from
young
sands
said
harris
but
even
now
i
ca
understand
how
you
reached
here
neither
does
he
said
negoro
with
a
malicious
grin
i
will
tell
you
now
and
you
may
repeat
the
story
to
your
young
friend
if
you
like
well
go
on
said
harris
when
we
started
continued
negoro
it
was
my
intention
to
sail
only
as
far
as
chili
that
would
have
brought
me
nearly
half
way
to
angola
but
three
weeks
after
leaving
auckland
captain
hull
and
all
his
crew
were
lost
in
chasing
a
whale
and
i
and
the
apprentice
were
the
only
seamen
left
on
board
then
why
in
the
name
of
peace
did
you
take
command
of
the
ship
exclaimed
harris
illustration
both
men
starting
to
their
feet
looked
anxiously
around
them
because
there
were
five
strong
niggers
who
did
trust
me
so
on
second
thoughts
i
determined
to
keep
my
old
post
as
cook
then
do
you
mean
to
say
that
it
was
mere
accident
that
brought
you
to
the
coast
of
africa
not
a
bit
of
it
the
only
accident
and
a
very
lucky
one
it
was
was
meeting
you
on
the
very
spot
where
we
stranded
but
it
was
my
doing
that
we
got
so
far
young
sands
understood
nothing
more
of
navigation
than
the
use
of
the
log
and
compass
well
one
fine
day
you
understand
the
log
remained
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
one
night
the
compass
was
tampered
with
so
that
the
scudding
along
before
a
tempest
was
carried
altogether
out
of
her
course
you
may
imagine
the
young
captain
was
puzzled
at
the
length
of
the
voyage
it
would
have
bewildered
a
more
experienced
head
than
his
before
he
was
aware
of
it
we
had
rounded
cape
horn
i
recognized
it
through
the
mist
then
at
once
i
put
the
compass
to
rights
again
and
the
was
carried
by
a
tremendous
hurricane
to
the
very
place
i
wanted
the
island
dick
sands
took
for
easter
island
was
really
tristan
good
said
harris
i
think
i
understand
now
how
our
friends
have
been
persuaded
to
take
angola
for
bolivia
but
they
are
undeceived
now
you
know
he
added
i
know
all
about
that
replied
the
portuguese
then
what
do
you
intend
to
do
said
harris
you
will
see
answered
negoro
significantly
but
first
of
all
tell
me
something
about
our
employer
old
alvez
how
is
he
oh
the
old
rascal
is
well
enough
and
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
again
replied
harris
is
he
at
the
market
at
bihé
no
he
has
been
at
his
place
at
kazonndé
for
a
year
or
more
and
how
does
business
go
on
badly
enough
on
this
coast
said
harris
plenty
of
slaves
are
waiting
to
be
shipped
to
the
spanish
colonies
but
the
difficulty
is
how
to
get
them
embarked
the
portuguese
authorities
on
the
one
hand
and
the
english
cruisers
on
the
other
almost
put
a
stop
to
exportation
altogether
down
to
the
south
near
mossamedes
is
the
only
part
where
it
can
be
attempted
with
any
chance
of
success
to
pass
a
caravan
through
benguela
or
loande
is
an
utter
impossibility
neither
the
governors
nor
the
chefés
will
listen
to
a
word
of
reason
old
alvez
is
therefore
thinking
of
going
in
the
other
direction
towards
nyangwe
and
lake
tanganyika
he
can
there
exchange
his
goods
for
slaves
and
ivory
and
is
sure
to
do
a
good
business
with
upper
egypt
and
the
coast
of
mozambique
which
supplies
madagascar
but
i
tell
you
negoro
he
added
gravely
i
believe
the
time
is
coming
when
the
will
come
to
an
end
altogether
the
english
missionaries
are
advancing
into
the
interior
that
fellow
livingstone
confound
him
has
finished
his
tour
of
the
lakes
and
is
now
working
his
way
towards
angola
then
there
is
another
man
named
cameron
who
is
talking
about
crossing
the
continent
from
east
to
west
and
it
is
feared
that
stanley
the
american
will
do
the
same
all
this
exploration
you
know
is
ruinous
to
our
business
and
it
is
to
our
interest
that
not
one
of
these
travellers
should
be
allowed
to
return
to
tell
tales
of
us
in
europe
footnote
subordinate
portuguese
governors
at
secondary
stations
harris
spoke
like
a
merchant
embarrassed
by
a
temporary
commercial
crisis
the
atrocious
scenes
to
which
the
are
accustomed
seems
to
render
them
impervious
to
all
sense
of
justice
or
humanity
and
they
learn
to
regard
their
living
merchandize
with
as
small
concern
as
though
they
were
dealing
with
chests
of
tea
or
hogsheads
of
sugar
but
harris
was
right
when
he
asserted
that
civilization
must
follow
the
wake
of
the
intrepid
pioneers
of
african
discovery
livingstone
first
and
after
him
grant
speke
burton
cameron
stanley
are
the
heroes
whose
names
will
ever
be
linked
with
the
first
dawnings
of
a
brighter
age
upon
the
dark
wilds
of
equatorial
africa
having
ascertained
that
his
accomplice
had
returned
unscrupulous
and
daring
as
ever
and
fully
prepared
to
pursue
his
former
calling
as
an
agent
of
old
alvez
the
slave
dealer
harris
inquired
what
he
proposed
doing
with
the
survivors
of
the
pilgrim
now
that
they
were
in
his
hands
divide
them
into
two
lots
answered
negoro
without
a
hesitation
one
for
the
market
the
other
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
but
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
an
index
to
the
malignity
of
his
purpose
which
shall
you
sell
asked
the
american
the
niggers
of
course
the
old
one
is
not
worth
much
but
the
other
four
ought
to
fetch
a
good
price
at
kazonndé
yes
you
are
right
said
harris
slaves
with
plenty
of
work
in
them
are
rare
articles
and
very
different
to
the
miserable
wretches
we
get
up
the
country
but
you
never
told
me
he
added
suddenly
changing
the
subject
whether
you
found
any
money
on
board
the
oh
i
rescued
a
few
hundred
dollars
from
the
wreck
that
was
all
said
the
portuguese
carelessly
but
i
am
expecting
he
stopped
short
what
are
you
expecting
inquired
harris
eagerly
oh
nothing
nothing
said
negoro
apparently
annoyed
that
he
had
said
so
much
and
immediately
began
talking
of
the
means
of
securing
the
living
prey
which
he
had
been
taking
so
many
pains
to
entrap
harris
informed
him
that
on
the
coanza
about
ten
miles
distant
there
was
at
the
present
time
encamped
a
slave
caravan
under
the
control
of
an
arab
named
ibn
hamish
plenty
of
native
soldiers
were
there
on
guard
and
if
dick
sands
and
his
people
could
only
be
induced
to
travel
in
that
direction
their
capture
would
be
a
matter
of
very
little
difficulty
he
said
that
of
course
dick
sands
first
thought
would
naturally
be
how
to
get
back
to
the
coast
it
was
not
likely
that
he
would
venture
a
second
time
through
the
forest
but
would
in
all
probability
try
to
make
his
way
to
the
nearest
river
and
descend
its
course
on
a
raft
to
the
sea
the
nearest
river
was
undoubtedly
the
coanza
so
that
he
and
negoro
might
feel
quite
sure
of
meeting
their
friends
upon
its
banks
if
you
really
think
so
said
negoro
there
is
not
much
time
to
be
lost
whatever
young
sands
determines
to
do
he
will
do
at
once
he
never
lets
the
grass
grow
under
his
feet
let
us
start
then
this
very
moment
mate
was
harris
reply
both
rose
to
their
feet
when
they
were
startled
by
the
same
rustling
in
the
papyrus
which
had
previously
aroused
negoro
fears
presently
a
low
growl
was
heard
and
a
large
dog
showing
his
teeth
emerged
from
the
bushes
evidently
prepared
for
an
attack
it
dingo
exclaimed
harris
confound
the
brute
he
shall
not
escape
me
this
time
said
negoro
he
caught
up
harris
gun
and
raising
it
to
his
shoulder
he
fired
just
as
the
dog
was
in
the
act
of
springing
at
his
throat
a
long
whine
of
pain
followed
the
report
and
dingo
disappeared
again
amongst
the
bushes
that
fringed
the
stream
negoro
was
instantly
upon
his
track
but
could
discover
nothing
beyond
a
few
upon
the
stalks
of
the
papyrus
and
a
long
crimson
trail
upon
the
pebbles
on
the
bank
i
think
i
have
done
for
the
beast
now
was
negoro
remark
as
he
returned
from
his
fruitless
search
harris
who
had
been
a
silent
spectator
of
the
whole
scene
now
asked
coolly
what
makes
that
animal
have
such
an
inveterate
dislike
to
you
oh
there
is
an
old
score
to
settle
between
us
replied
the
portuguese
what
about
inquired
the
american
negoro
made
no
reply
and
finding
him
evidently
disinclined
to
be
communicative
on
the
subject
harris
did
not
press
the
matter
any
further
a
few
moments
later
the
two
men
were
descending
the
stream
and
making
their
way
through
the
forest
towards
the
coanza
illustration
dingo
disappeared
again
amongst
the
bushes
chapter
iii
on
the
march
again
africa
africa
was
the
terrible
word
that
echoed
and
in
the
mind
of
dick
sands
as
he
pondered
over
the
events
of
the
preceding
weeks
he
could
now
understand
why
notwithstanding
the
rapid
progress
of
the
ship
the
land
seemed
ever
to
be
receding
and
why
the
voyage
had
been
prolonged
to
twice
its
anticipated
length
it
remained
however
a
mystery
inexplicable
as
before
how
and
when
they
had
rounded
cape
horn
and
passed
into
another
ocean
suddenly
the
idea
flashed
upon
him
that
the
compass
must
have
been
tampered
with
and
he
remembered
the
fall
of
the
first
compass
he
recalled
the
night
when
he
had
been
roused
by
tom
cry
of
alarm
that
negoro
had
fallen
against
the
binnacle
as
he
recollected
these
circumstances
he
became
more
and
more
convinced
that
it
was
negoro
who
was
the
mainspring
of
all
the
mischief
that
it
was
he
who
had
contrived
the
loss
of
the
pilgrim
and
compromised
the
safety
of
all
on
board
what
had
been
the
career
what
could
be
the
motives
of
a
man
who
was
capable
of
such
vile
machinations
but
shrouded
in
mystery
as
were
the
events
of
the
past
the
present
offered
a
prospect
equally
obscure
beyond
the
fact
that
he
was
in
africa
and
a
hundred
miles
from
the
coast
dick
knew
absolutely
nothing
he
could
only
conjecture
that
he
was
in
the
fatal
province
of
angola
and
assured
as
he
was
that
harris
had
acted
the
traitor
he
was
led
to
the
conclusion
that
he
and
negoro
had
been
playing
into
each
other
hands
the
result
of
the
collision
he
feared
might
be
very
disastrous
to
the
survivors
of
the
pilgrim
yet
in
what
manner
would
the
odious
stratagem
be
accomplished
dick
could
well
understand
that
the
negroes
would
be
sold
for
slaves
he
could
only
too
easily
imagine
that
upon
himself
negoro
would
wreak
the
vengeance
he
had
so
obviously
been
contemplating
but
for
weldon
and
the
other
helpless
members
of
the
party
what
fate
could
be
in
store
the
situation
was
terrible
but
yet
dick
did
not
flinch
he
had
been
appointed
captain
and
captain
he
would
remain
weldon
and
her
little
son
had
been
committed
to
his
charge
and
he
was
resolved
to
carry
out
his
trust
faithfully
to
the
end
for
several
hours
he
remained
wrapped
in
thought
pondering
over
the
present
and
the
future
weighing
the
evil
chances
against
the
good
only
to
be
convinced
that
the
evil
much
preponderated
at
length
he
rose
firm
resolute
calm
the
first
glimmer
of
dawn
was
breaking
upon
the
forest
all
the
rest
of
the
party
except
tom
were
fast
asleep
dick
sands
crept
softly
up
to
the
old
negro
and
whispered
tom
you
know
now
where
we
are
yes
yes
dick
only
too
well
i
know
it
we
are
in
africa
the
old
man
sighed
mournfully
tom
said
dick
in
the
same
low
voice
you
must
keep
this
a
secret
you
must
not
say
a
word
to
let
weldon
or
any
of
the
others
know
the
old
man
murmured
his
assent
and
dick
continued
it
will
be
quite
enough
for
them
to
learn
that
we
have
been
betrayed
by
harris
and
that
we
must
consequently
practise
extra
care
and
watchfulness
they
will
merely
think
we
are
taking
precautions
against
being
surprised
by
nomad
indians
i
trust
to
your
good
sense
tom
to
assist
me
in
this
you
may
depend
upon
me
dick
and
i
can
promise
you
that
we
will
all
do
our
best
to
prove
our
courage
and
to
show
our
devotion
to
your
service
illustration
you
must
keep
this
a
secret
thus
assured
of
tom
dick
proceeded
to
deliberate
upon
his
future
line
of
action
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
treacherous
american
startled
by
the
traces
of
the
slaves
and
the
unexpected
roaring
of
the
lion
had
taken
flight
before
he
had
conducted
his
victims
to
the
spot
where
they
were
to
be
attacked
and
that
consequently
some
hours
might
elapse
before
he
would
be
joined
by
negoro
who
to
judge
from
dingo
strange
behaviour
had
undoubtedly
for
the
last
few
days
been
somewhere
on
their
track
here
was
a
delay
that
might
be
turned
to
good
account
and
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
taking
advantage
of
it
to
commence
their
return
journey
to
the
coast
if
as
dick
had
every
reason
to
suppose
he
was
in
angola
he
hoped
to
find
either
north
or
south
some
portuguese
settlement
whence
he
could
obtain
the
means
of
transporting
his
party
to
their
several
homes
but
how
was
this
return
journey
to
be
accomplished
it
would
be
difficult
not
to
say
imprudent
to
retrace
their
footsteps
through
the
forest
it
would
merely
bring
them
to
their
and
would
moreover
afford
an
easy
track
for
negoro
or
his
accomplices
to
follow
the
safest
and
most
secret
means
of
reaching
the
coast
would
assuredly
be
by
descending
the
course
of
some
river
this
would
have
to
be
effected
by
constructing
a
strong
raft
from
which
the
little
party
well
armed
might
defend
themselves
alike
from
attacks
either
of
the
natives
or
of
wild
beasts
and
which
would
likewise
afford
a
comfortable
means
of
transport
for
weldon
and
her
little
boy
who
were
now
deprived
of
the
use
of
harris
horse
the
negroes
it
is
true
would
be
only
too
pleased
to
carry
the
lady
on
a
litter
of
branches
but
this
would
be
to
occupy
the
services
of
two
out
of
five
and
under
the
circumstances
it
was
manifestly
advisable
that
all
hands
should
be
free
to
act
on
the
defensive
another
great
inducement
towards
the
plan
was
that
dick
sands
felt
himself
much
more
at
home
in
travelling
by
water
than
by
land
and
was
longing
to
be
once
again
upon
what
to
him
was
as
it
were
his
native
element
he
little
dreamt
that
he
was
devising
for
himself
the
very
plan
that
harris
in
his
speculations
had
laid
down
for
him
the
most
urgent
matter
was
now
to
find
such
a
stream
as
would
suit
their
purpose
dick
had
several
reasons
for
feeling
sure
that
one
existed
in
the
neighbourhood
he
knew
that
the
little
river
which
fell
into
the
atlantic
near
the
spot
where
the
pilgrim
stranded
could
not
extend
very
far
either
to
the
north
or
east
because
the
horizon
was
bounded
in
both
directions
by
the
chain
of
mountains
which
he
had
taken
for
the
cordilleras
if
the
stream
did
not
rise
in
those
hills
it
must
incline
to
the
south
so
that
in
either
case
dick
was
convinced
he
could
not
be
long
in
discovering
it
or
one
of
its
affluents
another
sign
which
he
recognized
as
hopeful
was
that
during
the
last
few
miles
of
the
march
the
soil
had
become
moist
and
level
whilst
here
and
there
the
appearance
of
tiny
rivulets
indicated
that
an
aqueous
network
existed
in
the
subsoil
on
the
previous
day
too
the
caravan
had
skirted
a
rushing
torrent
of
which
the
waters
were
tinged
with
oxide
of
iron
from
its
sloping
banks
dick
scheme
was
to
make
his
way
back
as
far
as
this
stream
which
though
not
navigable
itself
would
in
all
probability
empty
itself
into
some
affluent
of
greater
importance
the
idea
which
he
imparted
to
tom
met
with
the
old
negro
entire
approval
as
the
day
dawned
the
sleepers
one
by
one
awoke
weldon
laid
little
jack
in
nan
arms
the
child
was
still
dozing
the
fever
had
abated
but
he
looked
painfully
white
and
exhausted
after
the
attack
dick
said
weldon
after
looking
round
her
where
is
harris
i
can
not
see
him
harris
has
left
us
answered
dick
very
quietly
do
you
mean
that
he
has
gone
on
ahead
no
madam
i
mean
that
he
has
left
us
and
gone
away
entirely
he
is
in
league
with
negoro
in
league
with
negoro
cried
weldon
ah
i
have
had
a
fancy
lately
that
there
has
been
something
wrong
but
why
what
can
be
their
motive
indeed
i
am
unable
to
tell
you
replied
dick
i
only
know
that
we
have
no
alternative
but
to
return
to
the
coast
immediately
if
we
would
escape
the
two
rascals
illustration
harris
has
left
us
i
only
wish
i
could
catch
them
said
hercules
who
had
overheard
the
conversation
i
would
soon
knock
their
heads
together
and
he
shook
his
two
fists
in
giving
emphasis
to
his
words
but
what
will
become
of
my
boy
cried
weldon
in
tones
of
despondency
i
have
been
so
sanguine
in
procuring
him
the
comforts
of
san
felice
master
jack
will
be
all
right
enough
madam
when
we
get
into
a
more
healthy
situation
near
the
coast
said
tom
but
is
there
no
farm
anywhere
near
no
village
no
shelter
she
pleaded
none
whatever
madam
i
can
only
repeat
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
we
make
the
best
of
our
way
back
to
the
are
you
quite
sure
dick
that
harris
has
deceived
us
dirk
felt
that
he
should
be
glad
to
avoid
any
discussion
on
the
subject
but
with
a
warning
glance
at
tom
he
proceeded
to
say
that
on
the
previous
night
he
and
tom
had
discovered
the
american
treachery
and
that
if
he
had
not
instantly
taken
to
his
horse
and
fled
he
would
have
answered
for
his
guilt
with
his
life
without
however
dwelling
for
a
moment
more
than
he
could
avoid
upon
the
past
he
hurried
on
to
detail
the
means
by
which
he
now
proposed
to
reach
the
sea
concluding
by
the
assertion
that
he
hoped
a
very
few
miles
march
would
bring
them
to
a
stream
on
which
they
might
be
able
to
embark
weldon
thoroughly
ignoring
her
own
weakness
professed
her
readiness
not
only
to
walk
but
to
carry
jack
too
bat
and
austin
at
once
volunteered
to
carry
her
in
a
litter
of
this
the
lady
would
not
hear
and
bravely
repeated
her
intention
of
travelling
on
foot
announcing
her
willingness
to
start
without
further
delay
dick
sands
was
only
too
glad
to
assent
to
her
wish
let
me
take
master
jack
said
hercules
i
shall
be
out
of
my
element
if
i
have
nothing
to
carry
the
giant
without
waiting
for
a
reply
took
the
child
from
nan
arms
so
gently
that
he
did
not
even
rouse
him
from
his
slumber
the
weapons
were
next
carefully
examined
and
the
provisions
having
been
repacked
into
one
parcel
were
consigned
to
the
charge
of
actæon
who
undertook
to
carry
them
on
his
back
cousin
benedict
whose
wiry
limbs
seemed
capable
of
bearing
any
amount
of
fatigue
was
quite
ready
to
start
it
was
doubtful
whether
he
had
noticed
harris
disappearance
he
was
suffering
from
a
loss
which
to
him
was
of
far
greater
importance
he
had
mislaid
his
spectacles
and
it
had
happened
that
bat
had
picked
them
up
in
the
long
grass
close
to
the
spot
where
the
amateur
naturalist
had
been
lying
but
acting
on
a
hint
from
dick
sands
he
said
nothing
about
them
in
this
way
the
entomologist
who
without
his
glasses
could
scarcely
see
a
yard
beyond
his
face
might
be
expected
to
be
kept
without
trouble
in
the
limits
of
the
ranks
and
having
been
placed
between
actæon
and
austin
with
strict
injunctions
not
to
leave
their
side
he
followed
them
as
submissively
as
a
blind
man
in
the
start
was
made
but
scarcely
had
the
little
troop
advanced
fifty
yards
upon
their
way
when
tom
suddenly
cried
out
where
dingo
with
all
the
force
of
his
tremendous
lungs
hercules
gave
a
series
of
reverberating
shouts
dingo
dingo
dingo
not
a
bark
could
be
distinguished
in
reply
dingo
dingo
dingo
again
echoed
in
the
air
but
all
was
silence
dick
was
intensely
annoyed
at
the
of
the
dog
his
presence
would
have
been
an
additional
safeguard
in
the
event
of
any
sudden
surprise
perhaps
he
has
followed
harris
suggested
tom
far
more
likely
he
is
on
the
track
of
negoro
rejoined
dick
then
negoro
to
a
dead
certainty
said
hercules
will
put
a
bullet
into
his
head
it
is
to
be
hoped
replied
bat
that
dingo
will
strangle
him
first
dick
sands
disguising
his
vexation
said
at
any
rate
we
have
no
time
to
wait
for
the
animal
now
if
he
is
alive
he
will
not
fail
to
find
us
out
move
on
my
lads
move
on
the
weather
was
very
hot
ever
since
daybreak
heavy
clouds
had
been
gathering
upon
the
horizon
and
it
seemed
hardly
likely
that
the
day
would
pass
without
a
storm
fortunately
the
woods
were
sufficiently
light
to
ensure
a
certain
amount
of
freshness
to
the
surface
of
the
soil
here
and
there
were
large
patches
of
tall
rank
grass
enclosed
by
clumps
of
forest
trees
in
some
places
fossilized
trunks
lying
on
the
ground
betokened
the
existence
of
one
of
the
coal
districts
that
are
common
upon
the
continent
of
africa
along
the
glades
the
carpet
of
verdure
was
relieved
by
crimson
stems
and
a
variety
of
flowers
blue
and
yellow
pale
lobelias
and
red
orchids
fertilized
by
the
numerous
insects
that
incessantly
hovered
about
them
the
trees
did
not
grow
in
impenetrable
masses
of
one
species
but
exhibited
themselves
in
infinite
variety
there
was
also
a
species
of
palm
producing
an
oil
locally
much
valued
there
were
growing
in
bushes
eight
or
ten
feet
high
the
cotton
attached
in
long
shreds
to
the
ligneous
stalks
and
there
were
copals
from
which
pierced
by
the
proboscis
of
certain
insects
exudes
an
odorous
resin
that
flows
on
to
the
ground
and
is
collected
by
the
natives
then
there
were
citrons
and
wild
pomegranates
and
a
score
of
other
arborescent
plants
all
testifying
to
the
fertility
of
this
plateau
of
central
africa
in
many
places
too
the
air
was
fragrant
with
the
odour
of
vanilla
though
it
was
not
possible
to
discover
the
shrub
from
which
the
perfume
emanated
in
spite
of
it
being
the
dry
season
so
that
the
soil
had
only
been
moistened
by
occasional
storms
all
trees
and
plants
were
flourishing
in
great
luxuriance
it
was
the
time
of
year
for
fever
but
according
to
livingstone
observation
the
disorder
may
generally
be
cured
by
quitting
the
locality
where
it
has
been
contracted
dick
expressed
his
hope
that
in
little
jack
case
the
words
of
the
great
traveller
would
be
verified
and
in
encouragement
of
this
sanguine
view
pointed
out
to
weldon
that
although
it
was
past
the
time
for
the
periodical
return
of
the
fever
the
child
was
still
slumbering
quietly
in
hercules
arms
the
march
was
continued
with
as
much
rapidity
as
was
consistent
with
caution
occasionally
where
the
bushes
and
brushwood
had
been
broken
down
by
the
recent
passage
of
men
or
beasts
progress
was
comparatively
easy
but
much
more
frequently
greatly
to
dick
annoyance
obstacles
of
various
sorts
impeded
their
advance
climbing
plants
grew
in
such
inextricable
confusion
that
they
could
only
be
compared
to
a
rigging
involved
in
hopeless
entanglement
there
were
creepers
resembling
curved
scimitars
thickly
covered
with
sharp
thorns
there
were
likewise
strange
growths
like
vegetable
serpents
fifty
or
sixty
feet
long
which
seemed
to
have
a
cruel
faculty
for
torturing
every
passenger
with
their
prickly
spines
axe
in
hand
the
negroes
had
repeatedly
to
cut
their
road
through
these
bewildering
obstructions
that
clothed
the
trees
from
their
summit
to
their
base
animal
life
was
no
less
remarkable
in
its
way
than
the
vegetation
birds
in
great
variety
flitted
about
in
the
ample
foliage
secure
from
any
stray
shot
from
the
little
band
whose
chief
object
it
was
to
preserve
its
incognito
were
seen
in
considerable
numbers
francolins
in
several
varieties
and
a
few
specimens
of
the
bird
to
which
the
americans
in
imitation
of
their
note
have
given
the
name
of
if
dick
had
not
had
too
much
evidence
in
other
ways
to
the
contrary

might
almost
have
imagined
himself
in
a
province
of
the
new
world
hitherto
they
had
been
unmolested
by
any
dangerous
wild
beasts
during
the
present
stage
of
their
march
a
herd
of
giraffes
startled
by
their
unexpected
approach
rushed
fleetly
past
this
time
however
without
being
represented
as
ostriches
occasionally
a
dense
cloud
of
dust
on
the
edge
of
the
prairie
accompanied
by
a
sound
like
the
roll
of
chariots
betokened
the
flight
of
a
herd
of
buffaloes
but
with
these
exceptions
no
animal
of
any
magnitude
appeared
in
view
illustration
the
march
was
continued
with
as
much
rapidity
as
was
consistent
with
caution
for
about
two
miles
dick
followed
the
course
of
the
rivulet
in
the
hope
that
it
would
emerge
into
a
more
important
stream
which
would
convey
them
without
much
difficulty
or
danger
direct
to
the
sea
towards
noon
about
three
miles
had
been
accomplished
and
a
halt
was
made
for
rest
neither
negoro
nor
harris
had
been
seen
nor
had
dingo
reappeared
the
encampment
for
the
midday
refreshment
was
made
under
the
shelter
of
a
clump
of
bamboos
which
effectually
concealed
them
all
few
words
were
spoken
during
the
meal
weldon
could
eat
nothing
she
had
again
taken
her
little
boy
into
her
arms
and
seemed
wholly
absorbed
in
watching
him
again
and
again
dick
begged
her
to
take
some
nourishment
urging
upon
her
the
necessity
of
keeping
up
her
strength
we
shall
not
be
long
in
finding
a
good
current
to
carry
us
to
the
coast
said
the
lad
brightly
weldon
raised
her
eyes
to
his
animated
features
with
so
sanguine
and
resolute
a
leader
with
such
devoted
servants
as
the
five
negroes
in
attendance
she
felt
that
she
ought
not
utterly
to
despair
was
she
not
after
all
on
friendly
soil
what
great
harm
could
harris
perpetrate
against
her
or
her
belongings
she
would
hope
still
hope
for
the
best
rejoiced
as
he
was
to
see
something
of
its
former
brightness
return
to
her
countenance
dick
nevertheless
had
scarcely
courage
steadily
to
return
her
searching
gaze
had
she
known
the
whole
truth
he
knew
that
her
heart
must
fail
her
utterly
chapter
iv
rough
travelling
just
at
this
moment
jack
woke
up
and
put
his
arms
round
his
neck
his
eyes
were
brighter
and
there
was
manifestly
no
return
of
fever
you
are
better
darling
said
weldon
pressing
him
tenderly
to
her
yes
mamma
i
am
better
but
i
am
very
thirsty
some
cold
water
was
soon
procured
which
the
child
drank
eagerly
and
then
began
to
look
about
him
his
first
inquiry
was
for
his
old
friends
dick
and
hercules
both
of
whom
approached
at
his
summons
and
greeted
him
affectionately
where
is
the
horse
was
the
next
question
gone
away
master
jack
i
am
your
horse
now
said
hercules
but
you
have
no
bridle
for
me
to
hold
said
jack
looking
rather
disappointed
you
may
put
a
bit
in
my
mouth
if
you
like
master
jack
replied
hercules
extending
his
jaws
and
then
you
may
pull
as
hard
as
you
please
o
i
shall
not
pull
very
hard
said
jack
but
have
we
nearly
come
to
harris
farm
weldon
assured
the
child
that
they
should
soon
be
where
they
wanted
to
be
and
dick
finding
that
the
conversation
was
approaching
dangerous
ground
proposed
that
the
journey
should
be
now
resumed
weldon
assented
the
encampment
was
forthwith
broken
up
and
the
march
continued
as
before
illustration
it
was
a
scene
only
too
common
in
central
africa
in
order
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
watercourse
it
was
necessary
to
cut
a
way
right
through
the
underwood
progress
was
consequently
very
slow
and
a
little
over
a
mile
was
all
that
was
accomplished
in
about
three
hours
footpaths
had
evidently
once
existed
but
they
had
all
become
what
the
natives
term
dead
that
is
they
had
become
entirely
overgrown
with
brushwood
and
brambles
the
negroes
worked
away
with
a
will
hercules
in
particular
who
temporarily
resigned
his
charge
to
nan
wielded
his
axe
with
marvellous
effect
all
the
time
giving
vent
to
stentorian
groans
and
grunts
and
succeeded
in
opening
the
woods
before
him
as
if
they
were
being
consumed
by
a
devouring
fire
fortunately
this
heavy
labour
was
not
of
very
long
duration
after
about
a
mile
an
opening
of
moderate
width
converging
towards
the
stream
and
following
its
bank
was
discovered
in
the
underwood
it
was
a
passage
formed
by
elephants
which
apparently
by
hundreds
must
be
in
the
habit
of
traversing
this
part
of
the
forest
the
spongy
soil
soaked
by
the
downpour
of
the
rainy
season
was
everywhere
indented
with
the
enormous
impressions
of
their
feet
but
it
soon
became
evident
that
elephants
were
not
the
only
living
creatures
that
had
used
this
track
human
bones
gnawed
by
beasts
of
prey
whole
human
skeletons
still
wearing
the
iron
fetters
of
slavery
everywhere
strewed
the
ground
it
was
a
scene
only
too
common
in
central
africa
where
like
cattle
driven
to
the
slaughter
poor
miserable
men
are
dragged
in
caravans
for
hundreds
of
weary
miles
to
perish
on
the
road
in
countless
numbers
beneath
the
trader
lash
to
succumb
to
the
mingled
horrors
of
fatigue
privation
and
disease
or
if
provisions
fail
to
be
butchered
without
pity
or
remorse
by
sword
and
gun
that
had
passed
that
way
was
too
obvious
to
permit
a
doubt
for
at
least
a
mile
at
almost
every
step
dick
came
in
contact
with
the
scattered
bones
while
ever
and
again
huge
goat
suckers
disturbed
by
the
approach
of
the
travellers
rose
with
flapping
wings
and
circled
round
their
heads
the
youth
heart
sank
with
secret
dismay
lest
weldon
should
divine
the
meaning
of
this
ghastly
scene
and
appeal
to
him
for
explanation
but
fortunately
she
had
again
insisted
on
carrying
her
little
patient
and
although
the
child
was
fast
asleep
he
absorbed
her
whole
attention
nan
was
by
her
side
almost
equally
engrossed
old
tom
alone
was
fully
alive
to
the
significance
of
his
surroundings
and
with
downcast
eyes
he
mournfully
pursued
his
march
full
of
amazement
the
other
negroes
looked
right
and
left
upon
what
might
appear
to
them
as
the
upheaval
of
some
vast
cemetery
but
they
uttered
no
word
of
inquiry
or
surprise
meantime
the
bed
of
the
stream
had
increased
both
in
breadth
and
depth
and
the
rivulet
had
in
a
degree
lost
its
character
of
a
rushing
torrent
this
was
a
change
which
dick
sands
observed
hopefully
interpreting
it
as
an
indication
that
it
might
itself
become
navigable
or
would
empty
itself
into
some
more
important
tributary
of
the
atlantic
his
resolve
was
fixed
he
would
follow
its
course
at
all
hazards
as
soon
therefore
as
he
found
that
the
elephant
track
was
quitting
the
water
edge
he
made
up
his
mind
to
abandon
it
and
had
no
hesitation
in
again
resorting
to
the
use
of
the
axe
once
more
then
commenced
the
labour
of
cutting
a
way
through
the
entanglement
of
bushes
and
creepers
that
were
thick
upon
the
soil
it
was
no
longer
forest
through
which
they
were
wending
their
arduous
path
trees
were
comparatively
rare
only
tall
clumps
of
bamboos
rose
above
the
grass
so
high
however
that
even
hercules
could
not
see
above
them
and
the
passage
of
the
little
troop
could
only
have
been
discovered
by
the
rustling
in
the
stalks
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
the
soil
became
soft
and
marshy
it
was
evident
that
the
travellers
were
crossing
plains
that
in
a
long
rainy
season
must
be
inundated
the
ground
was
carpeted
with
luxuriant
mosses
and
graceful
ferns
and
the
continual
appearance
of
brown
hematite
wherever
there
was
a
rise
in
the
soil
betokened
the
existence
of
a
rich
vein
of
metal
beneath
remembering
what
he
had
read
in
livingstone
account
of
these
treacherous
swamps
dick
bade
his
companions
take
their
footing
warily
he
himself
led
the
way
tom
expressed
his
surprise
that
the
ground
should
be
so
soaked
when
there
had
been
no
rain
for
some
time
i
think
we
shall
have
a
storm
soon
said
bat
all
the
more
reason
then
replied
dick
why
we
should
get
away
from
these
marshes
as
quickly
as
possible
carry
jack
again
hercules
and
you
bat
and
austin
keep
close
to
weldon
so
as
to
be
able
to
assist
her
if
she
wants
your
help
but
take
care
take
care
mr
benedict
he
cried
out
in
sudden
alarm
what
are
you
doing
sir
i
slipping
in
was
poor
benedict
helpless
reply
he
had
trodden
upon
a
kind
of
quagmire
and
as
though
a
trap
had
been
opened
beneath
his
feet
was
fast
disappearing
into
the
slough
assistance
was
immediately
rendered
and
the
unfortunate
naturalist
was
dragged
out
covered
with
mud
almost
to
his
waist
but
thoroughly
satisfied
because
his
precious
box
of
specimens
had
suffered
no
injury
actæon
undertook
for
the
future
to
keep
close
to
his
side
and
endeavour
to
avoid
a
repetition
of
the
mishap
the
accident
could
not
be
said
to
be
altogether
free
from
unpleasant
consequences
in
great
numbers
had
risen
to
the
surface
of
the
mire
from
which
benedict
had
been
extricated
and
as
they
burst
they
disseminated
an
odious
stench
that
was
intolerable
the
passage
of
these
pestilential
districts
is
not
unfrequently
very
dangerous
and
livingstone
who
on
several
occasions
waded
through
them
in
mud
that
reached
to
his
breast
compares
them
to
great
sponges
composed
of
black
porous
earth
in
which
every
footstep
causes
streams
of
moisture
to
ooze
out
for
well
nigh
half
a
mile
they
had
now
to
wend
their
cautious
way
across
this
spongy
soil
weldon
in
the
soft
mud
was
at
last
compelled
to
come
to
a
and
hercules
bat
and
austin
all
resolved
that
she
should
be
spared
further
discomfort
and
insisted
upon
weaving
some
bamboos
into
a
litter
upon
which
after
much
reluctance
to
become
such
a
burden
she
was
induced
with
jack
beside
her
to
take
her
place
after
the
delay
thus
caused
the
procession
again
started
on
its
perilous
route
dick
sands
continued
to
walk
at
the
head
in
order
to
test
the
stability
of
the
footing
action
followed
holding
cousin
benedict
firmly
by
the
arm
tom
took
charge
of
old
nan
who
without
his
support
would
certainly
have
fallen
into
the
quagmire
and
the
three
other
negroes
carried
the
litter
in
the
rear
it
was
a
matter
of
the
greatest
difficulty
to
find
a
path
that
was
sufficiently
firm
the
method
they
adopted
was
to
pick
their
way
as
much
as
possible
on
the
long
rank
grass
that
on
the
margin
of
the
swamps
was
tolerably
tough
but
in
spite
of
the
greatest
precaution
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
escaped
occasionally
sinking
up
to
his
knees
in
slush
at
about
five
they
were
relieved
by
finding
themselves
on
ground
of
a
more
clayey
character
it
was
still
soft
and
porous
below
but
its
surface
was
hard
enough
to
give
a
secure
foothold
there
were
watery
pores
that
percolated
the
subsoil
and
these
gave
evident
witness
to
the
proximity
of
a
the
heat
would
have
been
intolerably
oppressive
if
it
had
not
been
tempered
by
some
heavy
which
obstructed
the
direct
influence
of
the
sun
rays
lightning
was
observed
to
be
playing
faintly
about
the
sky
and
there
was
now
and
again
the
low
growl
of
distant
thunder
the
indications
of
a
gathering
storm
were
too
manifest
to
be
disregarded
and
dick
could
not
help
being
very
uneasy
he
had
heard
of
the
extreme
violence
of
african
storms
and
knew
that
torrents
of
rain
hurricanes
that
no
tree
could
resist
and
thunderbolt
after
thunderbolt
were
the
usual
accompaniment
of
these
tempests
and
here
in
this
lowland
desert
which
too
surely
would
be
completely
inundated
there
would
not
be
a
tree
to
which
they
could
resort
for
shelter
while
it
would
likewise
be
utterly
vain
to
hope
to
obtain
a
refuge
by
excavation
as
water
would
be
found
only
two
feet
below
the
surface
illustration
another
brilliant
flash
brought
the
camp
once
again
into
relief
after
scrutinizing
the
landscape
however
he
noticed
some
low
elevations
on
the
north
that
seemed
to
form
the
boundary
of
the
marshy
plain
a
few
trees
were
scattered
along
their
summits
if
his
party
could
get
no
other
shelter
here
he
hoped
they
would
be
able
to
find
themselves
free
from
any
danger
caused
by
the
rising
flood
push
on
friends
push
on
he
cried
three
miles
more
and
we
shall
be
out
of
this
treacherous
lowland
his
words
served
to
inspire
a
fresh
confidence
and
in
spite
of
all
the
previous
fatigue
every
energy
was
brought
into
play
with
renewed
vigour
hercules
in
particular
seemed
ready
to
carry
the
whole
party
if
it
had
been
in
his
power
the
storm
was
not
long
in
beginning
the
rising
ground
was
still
two
miles
away
although
the
sun
was
above
the
horizon
the
darkness
was
almost
complete
the
overhanging
volumes
of
vapour
sank
lower
and
lower
towards
the
earth
but
happily
the
full
force
of
the
deluge
which
must
ultimately
come
did
not
descend
as

lightning
red
and
blue
flashed
on
every
side
and
appeared
to
cover
the
ground
with
a
network
of
flame
ever
and
again
the
little
knot
of
travellers
were
in
peril
of
being
struck
by
the
thunderbolts
which
on
that
treeless
plain
had
no
other
object
of
attraction
poor
little
jack
who
had
been
awakened
by
the
perpetual
crashes
buried
his
face
in
terror
in
hercules
breast
anxious
however
not
to
distress
his
mother
by
any
outward
exhibition
of
alarm
the
negro
endeavoured
to
pacify
him
by
promises
that
the
lightning
should
not
touch
him
and
the
child
ever
confident
in
the
protection
of
his
huge
friend
lost
something
of
his
nervousness
but
it
could
not
be
long
before
the
clouds
would
burst
and
discharge
the
threatened
what
are
we
to
do
tom
asked
dick
drawing
up
close
to
the
side
we
must
make
a
rush
for
it
push
on
with
all
the
speed
we
can
but
where
cried
dick
straight
on
was
the
prompt
reply
if
the
rain
catches
us
here
on
the
plain
we
shall
all
be
drowned
but
where
are
we
to
go
repeated
dick
in
despair
if
only
there
were
a
hut
but
look
look
there
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
had
lit
up
the
country
and
dick
declared
that
he
could
see
a
camp
which
could
hardly
be
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
the
negro
looked
doubtful
i
saw
it
too
he
assented
but
if
it
be
a
camp
at
all
it
would
be
a
camp
of
natives
and
to
fall
into
that
would
involve
us
in
a
worse
fate
than
the
rain
another
brilliant
flash
brought
the
camp
once
again
into
relief
it
appeared
to
be
made
up
of
about
a
hundred
conical
tents
arranged
very
symmetrically
each
of
them
being
from
twelve
to
fifteen
feet
in
height
it
had
the
appearance
from
a
distance
of
being
deserted
if
it
were
really
so
it
would
afford
just
the
shelter
that
was
needed
otherwise
at
all
hazards
it
must
be
most
carefully
avoided
i
will
go
in
advance
said
dick
after
a
moment
reflection
and
reconnoitre
it
let
one
of
us
at
least
go
with
you
replied
tom
no
stay
where
you
are
i
shall
be
much
less
likely
to
be
discovered
if
i
go
alone
without
another
word
he
darted
off
and
was
soon
lost
in
the
sombre
darkness
that
was
only
broken
by
the
frequent
lightning
large
drops
of
rain
were
now
beginning
to
fall
tom
and
dick
had
been
walking
some
little
distance
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
the
party
who
consequently
had
not
overheard
their
conversation
a
halt
being
made
weldon
inquired
what
was
the
matter
tom
explained
that
a
camp
or
village
had
been
noticed
a
little
way
in
front
and
that
the
captain
had
gone
forward
to
investigate
it
weldon
asked
no
further
questions
but
quietly
waited
the
result
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
before
dick
returned
you
may
come
on
he
cried
is
the
camp
deserted
asked
tom
it
is
not
a
camp
at
all
it
is
a
lot
of
echoed
benedict
suddenly
aroused
into
a
state
of
excitement
illustration
one
after
another
the
whole
party
made
their
way
inside
no
doubt
of
it
mr
benedict
replied
dick
they
are
twelve
feet
high
at
least
and
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
get
into
them
twelve
feet
the
naturalist
repeated
they
must
be
those
of
the
termites
the
white
ants
there
is
no
other
insect
that
could
make
them
wonderful
architects
are
the
termites
termites
or
whatever
they
are
they
will
have
to
turn
out
for
us
said
dick
but
they
will
eat
us
up
objected
benedict
i
ca
help
that
retorted
dick
go
we
must
and
go
at
once
but
stop
a
moment
continued
the
provoking
naturalist
stop
and
tell
me
i
ca
be
wrong
i
always
thought
that
white
ants
could
never
be
found
elsewhere
than
in
africa
come
along
sir
i
say
come
along
quick
shouted
dick
terrified
lest
weldon
should
have
overheard
him
they
hurried
on
a
wind
had
risen
large
spattering
drops
were
now
beginning
to
fall
more
heavily
on
the
ground
and
in
a
few
minutes
it
would
be
impossible
to
stand
against
the
advancing
tempest
the
nearest
of
the
accumulation
of
was
reached
in
time
and
however
dangerous
their
occupants
might
be
it
was
decided
either
to
expel
them
or
to
share
their
quarters
each
cone
was
formed
of
a
kind
of
reddish
clay
and
had
a
single
opening
at
its
base
hercules
took
his
hatchet
and
quickly
enlarged
the
aperture
till
it
would
admit
his
own
huge
body
not
an
ant
made
its
appearance
cousin
benedict
expressed
his
extreme
surprise
but
the
structure
unquestionably
was
empty
and
one
after
another
the
whole
party
made
their
way
inside
the
rain
by
this
time
was
descending
in
terrific
torrents
strong
enough
to
extinguish
one
would
think
the
most
violent
explosions
of
the
electric
fluid
but
the
travellers
were
secure
in
their
shelter
and
had
nothing
to
fear
for
the
present
their
tenement
was
of
greater
stability
than
a
tent
or
a
native
hut
it
was
one
of
those
marvellous
structures
erected
by
little
insects
which
to
cameron
appeared
even
more
wonderful
than
the
upraising
of
the
egyptian
pyramids
by
human
hands
to
use
his
own
comparison
it
might
be
likened
to
the
construction
of
a
mount

the
loftiest
of
the
himalayan
peaks
by
the
united
labour
of
a
nation
chapter
white

the
storm
had
now
burst
in
full
fury
and
fortunate
it
was
that
a
refuge
had
been
found
the
rain
did
not
fall
in
separate
drops
as
in
temperate
zones
but
descended
like
the
waters
of
a
cataract
in
one
solid
and
compact
mass
in
a
way
that
could
only
suggest
the
outpour
of
some
vast
aerial
basin
containing
the
waters
of
an
entire
ocean
contrary
too
to
the
storms
of
higher
latitudes
of
which
the
duration
seems
ordinarily
to
be
in
inverse
ratio
to
their
violence
these

tempests
whatever
their
magnitude
often
last
for

days
furrowing
the
soil
into
deep
ravines
changing
plains
to
lakes
and
brooks
to
torrents
and
causing
rivers
to
overflow
and
cover
vast
districts
with
their
inundations
it
is
hard
to
understand
whence
such
volumes
of
vapour
and
electric
fluid
can
accumulate
the

upon
these
occasions
might
almost
seem
to
be
carried
back
to
the
remote
period
which
has
been
called
the
diluvian
age
happily
the
walls
of
the
were
very
thick
no
formed
of
pounded
earth
could
be
more
perfectly
and
a
torrent
might
have
passed
over
it
without
a
particle
of
moisture
making
its
way
through
its
substance
as
soon
as
the
party
had
taken
possession
of
the
tenement
a
lantern
was
lighted
and
they
proceeded
to
examine
the
interior
the
cone
which
was
about
twelve
feet
high
inside
was
eleven
feet
wide
at
the
base
gradually
narrowing
to
a
top
the
walls
and
partitions
between
the
tiers
of
cells
were
nowhere
less
than
a
foot
thick

these
wonderful
erections

result
of
the
combined
labour
of
innumerable
insects

no
means
uncommon

smeathman
a
dutch
traveller
of
the
last
century
has
recorded
how
he
and
four
companions
all
at
one
time
occupied
the
summit
of
one
of
them
in
loundé
livingstone
noticed
some
made
of
red
clay
of
which
the
height
varied
from
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
and
in
nyangwé
cameron
several
times
mistook
one
of
these
colonies
for
a
native
camp
pitched
upon
the
plain
he
described
some
of
these
strange
edifices
as
being
flanked
with
small
spires
giving
them
the
appearance
of
a
the
reddish
clay
of
which
the
was
composed
could
leave
no
doubt
upon
the
mind
of
a
naturalist
that
it
had
been
formed
by
the
species
known
as
termes
bellicosus
had
it
been
made
of
grey
or
black
alluvial
soil
it
might
have
been
attributed
to
the
termes
mordax
or
termes
atrox
formidable
names
that
must
awaken
anything
but
pleasure
in
the
minds
of
all
but
enthusiast
entomologists
in
the
centre
was
an
open
space
surrounded
by
roomy
compartments
ranged
one
upon
another
like
the
berths
of
a
ship
cabin
and
lined
with
the
millions
of
cells
that
had
been
occupied
by
the
ants
this
central
space
was
inadequate
to
hold
the
whole
party
that
had
now
made
their
hurried
resort
to
it
but
as
each
of
the
compartments
was
sufficiently
capacious
to
admit
one
person
to
occupy
it
in
a
sitting
posture
weldon
jack
nan
and
cousin
benedict
were
exalted
to
the
upper
tier
austin
bat
and
actæon
occupied
the
next
story
whilst
tom
and
hercules
and
dick
sands
himself
remained
below
dick
soon
found
that
the
soil
beneath
his
feet
was
beginning
to
get
damp
and
insisted
upon
having
some
of
the
dry
clay
spread
over
it
from
the
base
of
the
cone
it
is
a
long
time
he
said
since
we
have
slept
with
a
roof
over
our
heads
and
i
am
anxious
to
make
our
refuge
as
secure
as
possible
it
may
be
that
we
shall
have
to
stay
here
for
a
whole
day
or
more
on
the
first
opportunity
i
shall
go
and
explore
it
may
turn
out
that
we
are
near
the
stream
we
are
seeking
and
perhaps
we
shall
have
to
build
a
raft
before
we
start
again
illustration
cousin
benedict
curiosity
was
awakened
under
his
direction
therefore
hercules
took
his
hatchet
and
proceeded
to
break
down
the
lowest
range
of
cells
and
to
spread
the
dry
brittle
clay
of
which
they
were
composed
a
good
foot
thick
over
the
damp
floor
taking
care
not
in
any
way
to
block
up
the
aperture
by
which
the
fresh
air
penetrated
into
the
interior
it
was
indeed
fortunate
that
the
termites
had
abandoned
their
home
had
it
swarmed
with
its
multitudes
of
voracious
neuroptera
the
would
have
been
utterly
untenable
for
human
beings
cousin
curiosity
was
awakened
and
he
was
intensely
interested
in
the
question
of
the
evacuation
so
that
he
proceeded
at
once
to
investigate
if
he
could
whether
the
emigration
had
been
recent
or
otherwise
he
took
the
lantern
and
as
the
result
of
his
scrutiny
he
soon
discovered
in
a
recess
what
he
described
as
the
termites
storehouse
or
the
place
where
the
indefatigable
insects
keep
their
provisions
it
was
a
large
cavity
not
far
from
the
royal
cell
which
together
with
the
cells
for
the
reception
of
the
young
larvae
had
been
destroyed
by
hercules
in
the
course
of
his
flooring
operations
out
of
this
receptacle
benedict
drew
a
considerable
quantity
of
gum
and
vegetable
juices
all
in
a
state
so
liquid
as
to
demonstrate
that
they
had
been
deposited
there
quite
recently
they
have
only
just
gone
he
exclaimed
with
an
air
of
authority
as
if
he
imagined
that
some
one
was
about
to
challenge
his
assertion
we
are
not
going
to
dispute
your
word
benedict
said
dick
here
we
are
we
have
taken
their
place
and
shall
be
quite
content
for
them
to
keep
out
of
the
way
without
caring
when
they
went
or
where
they
have
gone
but
we
must
care
retorted
benedict
testily
why
they
have
gone
concerns
us
a
good
deal
these
juices
make
it
evident
from
the
liquid
state
in
which
we
find
them
that
the
ants
were
here
this
morning
they
have
not
only
gone
but
they
have
carried
off
their
young
larvae
with
them
they
have
been
sagacious
enough
to
take
warning
of
some
impending
danger
perhaps
they
heard
that
we
were
coming
said
hercules
laughing
a
look
of
withering
scorn
was
the
only
answer
that
the
entomologist
deigned
to
give
yes
i
say
repeated
hercules
perhaps
they
heard
that
we
were
coming
pshaw
said
benedict
contemptuously
do
you
imagine
they
would
be
afraid
of
you
they
would
reduce
your
carcase
to
a
skeleton
in
no
time
if
they
found
it
across
their
path
no
doubt
if
i
were
dead
replied
hercules
they
could
pick
my
bones
pretty
clean
but
while
i
had
the
use
of
my
limbs
i
think
i
could
crush
them
by
thousands
thousands
ejaculated
benedict
with
increasing
warmth
you
think
you
could
demolish
thousands
but
what
if
they
were
hundreds
of
thousands
millions
hundreds
of
millions
alive
as
much
as
dead
i
tell
you
they
would
be
long
in
consuming
every
morsel
of
you
during
this
brisk
little
discussion
dick
sands
had
been
pondering
over
what
benedict
had
said
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
amateur
naturalist
was
well
acquainted
with
the
habits
of
white
ants
and
if
as
he
affirmed
the
insects
had
instinctively
quitted
their
abode
on
account
of
some
approaching
danger
dick
asked
himself
whether
it
was
safe
or
prudent
for
his
party
to
remain
but
the
fury
of
the
storm
was
still
so
great
that
all
possibility
of
removing
from
the
shelter
seemed
precluded
for
the
present
and
without
inquiring
farther
into
the
mystery
he
merely
said
although
the
ants
benedict
have
left
us
their
provisions
we
must
not
forget
that
we
have
brought
our
own
we
will
have
our
supper
now
and
when
the
storm
is
over
we
will
see
what
is
to
be
done
fatigue
had
not
taken
away
the
appetite
of
the
energetic
travellers
and
they
gladly
set
about
the
preparation
of
their
meal
the
provisions
of
which
they
had
enough
for
another
two
days
had
not
been
injured
by
the
rain
for
some
minutes
the
crunching
of
hard
biscuit
was
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
hercules
in
particular
seemed
to
pound
away
with
his
huge
jaws
as
with
a
pair
of
millstones
illustration
the
naturalist
now
fairly
mounted
on
a
favourite
hobby
weldon
was
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
ate
little
and
that
little
was
only
taken
at
dick
earnest
solicitation
he
could
not
help
noticing
with
much
concern
that
although
jack
seemed
to
be
satisfactorily
recovering
and
without
sign
of
fever
was
sleeping
calmly
enough
on
a
bed
made
up
of
clothes
spread
out
in
one
of
the
cells
yet
his
mother
had
lost
much
of
her
courage
and
seemed
preoccupied
and
depressed
cousin
benedict
did
due
honour
to
the
simple
evening
repast
not
on
account
of
its
quantity
or
quality
but
because
it
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
holding
forth
upon
the
subject
of
termites
he
was
much
vexed
that
he
had
been
unable
to
discover
a
single
specimen
in
the
deserted
anthill
with
which
he
might
illustrate
his
lecture
but
notwithstanding
this
deficiency
he
continued
to
talk
heedless
whether
any
one
was
listening
they
are
wonderful
insects
he
said
they
belong
to
the
order
of
the
neuroptera
which
have
the
antennae
longer
than
the
head
their
mandibles
are
and
the
inferior
pair
of
wings
is
generally
as
large
as
the
superior
there
are
five
families
of
them
the
panorpide
the
myrmellonide
the
hemerobiide
the
termitine
and
the
perlide
i
need
hardly
say
that
what
we
are
now
occupying
is
a
dwelling
of
the
termitine
at
this
point
dick
became
all
attention
he
was
anxious
to
ascertain
whether
this
discovery
of
white
ants
had
aroused
any
suspicion
in
benedict
mind
that
they
must
be
on
african
soil
the
naturalist
now
fairly
mounted
on
a
favourite
hobby
went
on
with
his
discourse
i
am
sorry
not
to
have
a
specimen
to
show
you
but
these
termitine
have
four
joints
in
the
tarsi
and
strong
horny
mandibles
the
family
includes
as
genera
the
mantispa
the
raphidia
and
the
termes
the
last
commonly
known
as
white
ants
amongst
which
are
fatalis
termes
lucifugans
termes
mordax
and
several
others
more
or
less
rare
and
which
of
them
built
this
inquired
dick
the
bellicosi
replied
benedict
pronouncing
the
name
with
as
much
pride
as
if
he
were
eulogizing
the
macedonians
or
some
warlike
nation
of
antiquity
bellicosi
he
continued
are
to
be
found
of
every
size
there
is
as
much
difference
between
the
largest
and
the
smallest
of
them
as
there
is
between
hercules
and
a
dwarf
the
workers
are
about
of
an
inch
long
the
soldiers
or
are
half
an
inch
whilst
the

is
another
curious
species
called

are
about
half
an
inch
long

have
pincers
instead
of
mandibles

larger
than

like
sharks
in
fact
if
sharks
and

were
placed
in

i
should
be
inclined
to
back

and
where
are
these
sirafoos
most
generally
to
be
found
said
dick
cautiously
in
africa
in
the
southern
and
central
provinces
africa
may
truly
be
termed
the
land
of
ants
livingstone
in
the
notes
brought
home
by
stanley
describes
a
battle
which
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
witness
between
an
army
of
black
ants
and
an
army
of
red
the
black
ants
or
drivers
which
are
what
the
natives
call
sirafoos
got
the
best
of
it
and
the
red
ants
or
after
a
very
resolute
defence
were
obliged
to
retire
defeated
carrying
their
eggs
and
young
ones
with
them
livingstone
avows
that
he
never
saw
the
warlike
instinct
so
strongly
developed
as
in
these
sirafoos
the
stoutest
man
the
largest
animal
a
lion
or
an
elephant
quails
before
the
grip
of
their
mandibles
no
obstacle
impedes
their
progress
no
tree
is
too
lofty
for
them
to
scale
and
they
contrive
to
cross
wide
streams
by
forming
their
own
bodies
into
a
kind
of
suspension
bridge
equally
amazing
are
their
numbers
du
chaillu
another
african
traveller
relates
how
it
took
more
than
twelve
hours
for
a
column
of
ants
to
file
pass
him
without
a
moment
pause
in
their
march
these
numbers
however
cease
to
be
so
surprising
when
it
is
explained
that
their
fecundity
is
such
that
a
single
female
of
the
termites
bellicosi
has
been
estimated
to
produce
as
many
as
sixty
thousand
eggs
a
day
these
neuroptera

the
natives
with
a
favourite
food
grilled

being
considered
a
great
delicacy
have
you
ever
tasted
them
asked
hercules
with
a
grin
never
answered
the
naturalist
but
i
am
in
hopes
i
shall
have
a
chance
of
doing
so
very
soon
surely
you
do
imagine
yourself
in
africa
said
tom
suddenly
africa
no
why
should
i
replied
benedict
but
as
i
have
already
seen
a
tzetsy
in
america
i
do
not
despair
of
having
the
satisfaction
of
discovering
white
ants
there
too
you
do
not
know
the
sensation
i
shall
make
in
europe
when
i
publish
my
folio
volume
and
its
illustrations
it
was
evident
that
no
inkling
of
the
truth
had
yet
entered
poor
benedict
brain
and
it
seemed
likely
that
it
would
require
demonstration
far
more
striking
than
any
natural
phenomena
to
undeceive
the
minds
of
such
of
the
party
as
were
not
already
in
possession
of
the
fatal
secret
although
it
was
nine
cousin
benedict
went
on
talking
incessantly
regardless
of
the
fact
that
one
by
one
his
audience
were
falling
to
sleep
in
their
separate
cells
dick
sands
did
not
sleep
but
neither
did
he
interrupt
the
entomologist
by
farther
questions
hercules
kept
up
his
attention
longer
than
the
rest
but
at
length
he
too
succumbed
to
weariness
and
his
eyes
and
ears
were
closed
to
all
external
sights
and
sounds
but
endurance
has
limits
and
at
last
cousin
benedict
having
worn
himself
out
clambered
up
to
the
topmost
cell
of
the
cone
which
he
had
chosen
for
his
dormitory
and
fell
into
a
peaceful
slumber
the
lantern
had
been
already
extinguished
all
was
darkness
and
silence
within
whilst
the
storm
without
still
raged
with
a
violence
that
gave
no
sign
of
abatement
dick
sands
himself
was
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
was
not
partaking
in
the
repose
that
was
so
indispensable
to
them
all
but
he
could
not
sleep
his
every
thought
was
absorbed
in
the
responsibility
that
rested
on
him
to
rescue
those
under
his
charge
from
the
dangers
that
threatened
them
again
and
again
he
recalled
every
incident
that
had
occurred
since
the
loss
of
captain
hull
and
his
crew
he
remembered
the
occasion
when
he
had
stood
with
his
pistol
pointed
at
negoro
head
why
oh
why
had
his
hand
faltered
then
why
had
he
not
at
that
moment
hurled
the
miserable
wretch
overboard
and
thus
relieved
himself
and
his
partners
in
trouble
from
the
catastrophe
that
had
since
befallen
them
peril
was
still
staring
them
in
the
face
and
his
sole
drop
of
consolation
in
the
bitter
cup
of
despondency
was
that
weldon
was
still
ignorant
of
their
real
situation
at
that
moment
just
in
the
fever
of
his
agony
he
felt
a
light
breath
upon
his
forehead
a
hand
was
laid
upon
his
shoulder
and
a
gentle
voice
murmured
in
his
ear
my
poor
boy
i
know
everything
god
will
help
us
his
will
be
done

my
poor
boy

chapter
vi
a
this
sudden
revelation
that
weldon
was
acquainted
with
the
true
state
of
things
left
dick
speechless
even
had
he
been
capable
of
replying
she
gave
him
no
opportunity
but
immediately
retired
to
the
side
of
her
son
the
various
incidents
of
the
march
had
all
gradually
enlightened
her
and
perhaps
the
exclamation
of
cousin
benedict
on
the
preceding
evening
had
crowned
them
all
anyhow
the
brave
lady
now
knew
the
worst
dick
felt
however
that
she
did
not
despair
neither
would
he
he
lay
and
longed
for
the
dawn
when
he
hoped
to
explore
the
situation
better
and
perchance
to
find
the
watercourse
which
he
was
convinced
could
not
be
far
distant
moreover
he
was
extremely
anxious
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
the
natives
whom
it
was
only
too
likely
negoro
and
harris
might
be
putting
on
their
track
but
as
yet
no
glimmer
of
daylight
penetrated
the
aperture
of
the
cone
whilst
the
heavy
rumblings
deadened
as
they
were
by
the
thickness
of
the
walls
made
it
certain
that
the
storm
was
still
raging
with
undiminished
fury
attentively
dick
listened
and
he
could
distinctly
hear
the
rain
beating
around
the
base
of
the
the
heavy
drops
splashed
again
as
they
fell
in
a
way
altogether
different
to
what
they
would
upon
solid
ground
so
that
he
felt
sure
that
the
adjacent
land
was
by
this
time
completely
flooded
he
was
getting
very
drowsy
when
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
not
unlikely
the
aperture
was
getting
blocked
up
with
damp
clay
in
that
case
he
knew
that
the
breath
of
the
inmates
would
quickly
vitiate
the
internal
atmosphere
he
crept
along
the
ground
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
finding
that
the
clay
embankment
was
still
perfectly
dry
the
orifice
was
quite
unobstructed
allowing
not
only
a
free
passage
to
the
air
but
admitting
the
glare
of
the
occasional
flashes
of
lightning
which
the
descending
volumes
of
water
did
not
seem
to
stay
having
thus
far
satisfied
himself
that
all
was
well
and
that
there
was
no
immediate
danger
dick
thought
that
he
might
now
resign
himself
to
sleep
as
well
as
the
rest
he
took
the
precaution
however
of
stretching
himself
upon
the
embankment
within
easy
reach
of
the
opening
and
with
his
head
supported
against
the
wall
after
a
while
dozed
off
how
long
his
light
slumber
had
lasted
he
could
not
say
when
he
was
aroused
by
a
sensation
of
cold
he
started
up
and
to
his
horror
discovered
that
the
water
had
entered
the
and
was
rising
rapidly
it
could
not
be
long
he
saw
before
it
reached
the
cells
which
were
occupied
by
hercules
and
tom
he
woke
them
at
once
and
told
them
what
he
had
observed
the
lantern
was
soon
lighted
and
they
set
to
work
to
ascertain
what
progress
the
water
was
making
it
rose
for
about
five
feet
when
it
was
found
to
remain
stationary
what
is
the
matter
dick
inquired
weldon
disturbed
by
the
movements
of
the
men
nothing
very
alarming
answered
dick
promptly
only
some
water
has
found
its
way
into
the
lower
part
of
the
place
it
will
not
reach
your
upper
cells
probably
some
river
has
overflowed
its
boundaries
the
very
river
perhaps
suggested
hercules
assuringly
that
is
to
carry
us
to
the
coast
weldon
made
no
reply
cousin
benedict
was
still
sleeping
as
soundly
as
if
he
were
himself
a
white
ant
the
negroes
were
peering
down
on
to
the
sheet
of
water
which
reflected
back
the
rays
of
the
lantern
ready
to
carry
out
any
orders
given
by
dick
who
was
quietly
gauging
the
inundation
and
removing
the
provisions
and
out
of
its
reach
illustration
they
set
to
work
to
ascertain
what
progress
the
water
was
making
did
the
water
get
in
at
the
opening
mr
dick
asked
tom
yes
tom
and
consequently
we
are
coming
to
the
end
of
our
stock
of
fresh
air
was
dick
reply
but
why
should
we
not
make
another
opening
above
the
water
level
tom
inquired
a
thing
to
be
thought
about
said
dick
but
we
have
to
remember
that
if
we
have
five
feet
of
water
here
inside
there
is
probably
a
depth
of
six
or
seven
outside
in
rising
here
the
flood
has
compressed
the
air
and
made
it
an
obstacle
to
further
progress
but
if
we
allow
the
air
to
escape
we
may
perhaps
only
be
letting
the
water
rise
too
high
for
our
safety
we
are
just
as
if
we
were
in
a
then
what
is
to
be
done
asked
the
old
negro
no
doubt
replied
dick
we
must
proceed
very
cautiously
an
inconsiderate
step
will
jeopardize
our
lives
dick
sands
was
quite
correct
in
comparing
the
cone
to
an
immersed
in
that
mechanical
contrivance
however
the
air
can
always
be
renewed
by
means
of
pumps
so
that
it
can
be
occupied
without
inconvenience
beyond
what
is
entailed
by
a
somewhat
confined
atmosphere
but
here
the
interior
space
had
already
been
reduced
by
a
third
part
through
the
encroachment
of
the
water
and
there
was
no
method
of
communicating
with
the
outer
air
except
by
opening
a
new
aperture
an
operation
in
which
there
was
manifest
danger
dick
did
not
entertain
the
slightest
apprehension
that
the
would
be
carried
away
bodily
by
the
inundation
he
knew
that
it
would
adhere
to
its
base
as
firmly
as
a
what
he
really
dreaded
was
that
the
storm
would
last
so
long
that
the
flood
would
rise
high
above
the
plain
perhaps
submerging
the
entirely
so
that
ultimately
all
air
would
be
expelled
by
the
persistent
pressure
the
more
he
pondered
the
more
he
felt
himself
driven
to
the
conviction
that
the
inundation
would
be
wide
and
deep
it
could
not
be
he
felt
sure
entirely
owing
to
the
downpour
from
the
clouds
that
the
rapid
flood
was
rising
there
must
have
been
the
sudden
overflowing
of
some
stream
to
cause
such
a
deluge
over
the
plain
it
could
not
be
proved
that
the
ant
hill
was
not
already
under
water
so
that
escape
might
be
no
longer
possible
even
from
its
highest
point
with
all
dick
courage
it
was
yet
evident
that
he
was
very
uneasy
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
and
asked
himself
again
and
again
whether
patient
waiting
or
decisive
action
would
be
his
more
prudent
course
it
was
now
about
three
in
the
morning
all
within
the
were
silent
and
motionless
listening
to
the
incessant
turmoil
which
told
that
the
strife
of
the
elements
had
not
yet
ceased
presently
old
tom
pointed
out
that
the
height
of
the
water
was
gradually
increasing
but
only
by
very
slow
ascent
dick
could
only
say
that
if
the
flood
continued
to
rise
however
slowly
it
must
inevitably
drive
out
the
air
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
bat
called
out
let
me
try
and
get
outside
perhaps
i
might
dive
and
get
through
the
opening
i
think
i
had
better
make
that
experiment
myself
answered
dick
that
you
never
shall
interposed
tom
peremptorily
you
must
let
bat
go
it
may
not
be
possible
to
get
back
and
your
presence
is
indispensable
here
think
sir
think
of
weldon
and
master
jack
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
well
well
dick
assented
if
it
must
be
so
bat
shall
go
and
turning
to
bat
he
continued
do
not
try
to
come
back
again
we
will
try
if
we
can
to
follow
you
the
same
way
but
if
the
top
of
the
cone
is
still
above
water
knock
hard
on
it
with
your
hatchet
and
we
shall
take
it
as
a
signal
that
we
may
break
our
way
out
do
you
understand
all
right
he
said
all
right
sir
and
after
wringing
his
father
hand
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
plunged
into
the
water
that
filled
the
lower
section
of
the
it
was
an
exploit
that
required
considerable
agility
the
diver
would
have
to
find
the
orifice
make
his
way
through
it
and
without
loss
of
a
moment
let
himself
rise
to
the
surface
outside
full
half
a
minute
elapsed
and
dick
was
making
sure
that
the
negro
had
been
successful
in
his
effort
when
his
black
head
emerged
from
the
water
there
was
a
general
exclamation
of
surprise
it
is
blocked
up
gasped
bat
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
breath
enough
to
speak
blocked
up
cried
tom
yes
bat
affirmed
i
have
felt
all
round
the
wall
very
carefully
with
my
hand
and
i
am
sure
there
is
no
hole
left
i
suppose
the
water
has
dissolved
the
clay
if
you
can
not
find
a
hole
exclaimed
hercules
i
can
very
soon
make
one
and
he
was
just
about
to
plunge
his
hatchet
into
the
side
of
the
when
dick
prevented
him
stop
stop
you
must
not
be
in
such
a
hurry
he
reflected
for
a
few
moments
and
went
on
we
must
be
cautious
an
impetuous
step
may
be
destruction
perhaps
the
water
is
over
the
top
if
it
is
allowed
to
enter
then
at
once
is
an
end
of
all
but
whatever
we
do
urged
tom
must
be
done
at
once
there
is
no
time
to
lose
he
was
right
the
water
had
risen
till
it
was
quite
six
feet
deep
none
but
weldon
jack
nan
and
cousin
benedict
who
were
lodged
in
the
upper
cells
were
fairly
above
its
surface
dick
now
came
to
his
determination
at
about
a
foot
above
the
that
is
about
seven
feet
from
the
ground
he
resolved
to
bore
a
hole
through
the
clay
if
he
should
find
himself
in
communication
with
the
open
air
he
would
have
the
proof
he
desired
that
the
top
of
the
cone
was
still
uncovered
if
on
the
other
hand
he
should
ascertain
that
he
had
pierced
the
wall
below
the
surface
of
the
external
water
he
would
be
prepared
to
plug
up
the
hole
instantaneously
and
repeat
the
experiment
higher
up
it
was
true
that
the
inundation
might
have
risen
even
fifteen
feet
above
the
plain
in
that
case
the
worst
had
come
and
there
was
no
alternative
but
that
they
must
all
die
of
asphyxia
carefully
considering
the
chances
of
his
undertaking
dick
calmly
and
steadily
set
about
his
task
the
best
instrument
that
suggested
itself
for
his
purpose
was
the
ramrod
of
a
gun
which
having
a
sort
of
corkscrew
at
the
end
for
extracting
the
wadding
would
serve
as
an
auger
the
hole
would
be
very
small
but
yet
large
enough
for
the
requisite
test
hercules
showed
him
all
the
light
he
could
by
holding
up
the
lantern
there
were
several
candles
left
so
that
they
were
not
in
fear
of
being
altogether
in
darkness
the
operation
hardly
took
a
minute
the
ramrod
passed
through
the
clay
without
difficulty
a
muffled
sound
was
distinguished
as
of
rushing
through
a
column
of
water
as
the
air
escaped
the
water
in
the
cone
rose
perceptibly
the
hole
had
been
pierced
too
low
a
handful
of
clay
was
immediately
forced
into
the
orifice
which
was
thus
effectually
plugged
and
dick
turned
round
quietly
and
said
we
must
try
again
the
water
had
again
become
stationary
but
its
last
rise
had
diminished
the
amount
of
breathing
space
by
more
than
eight
inches
the
supply
of
oxygen
was
beginning
to
fail
respiration
was
becoming
difficult
and
the
flame
of
the
candle
burned
red
and
dim
about
a
foot
higher
than
the

the

just
as
the

was
being
inserted
a
loud
exclamation
of
delight
was
heard
proceeding
from
cousin
benedict

dick
paused
and
hercules
turned
the
lantern
towards
the
excited
naturalist
who
seemed
beaming
with
satisfaction
yes
yes
i
see
it
all
well
enough
he
cried
i

why
the

left
their

they
were
they
were
more
clever
than

are
they
knew
that

this
was

the

the

was
to

last
degree
alarming
the

had
all
but
reached
weldon
and
she
was
obliged
to
take
her
boy
into
her
arms
every
one
felt
nearly
stifled
a
loud
singing
was
heard
in
the
ears
and
the
lantern
showed
barely
any
light
at
all
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
air
would
be
incapable
of

remained
they
must
bore
another
hole
at
the
very
summit
of

not
that
they
were
unaware
of
the
imminent
danger
of
this

for
if

submerged
the

from

would
immediately
expel
the

and
death
must
be

a
few
brief
words
from
dick
explained
the
emergency
of
the
crisis
weldon
recognized
the
necessity
yes
dick
do
it
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
while
she
was
speaking
the
light
flickered
out
and
they
were
in
total
darkness
mounted
on
the
shoulders
of
hercules
who
was
crouching
in
one
of
the
his
head
only
just
above
water
dick
proceeded
to
force
the
ramrod
into
the
clay
which
at
the
vertex
of
the
was
considerably
harder
and
thicker
than
elsewhere
a
strange
mingling
of
hope
and
fear
thrilled
through
dick
sands
as
he
applied
his
hand
to
make
the
opening
which
was
to
admit
life
and
air
or
the
flood
of
death
the
silence
of
the
general
expectation
was
broken
by
the
noise
of
a
sharp
hissing
the
water
rose
for
eight
inches
but
all
at
once
it
ceased
to
rise
it
had
found
its
level
no
need
this
time
to
close
the
orifice
the
top
of
the
was
higher
than
the
top
of
the
flood
and
for
the
present
at
least
they
could
all
rejoice
that
their
lives
were
spared
a
general
cheer
led
by
the
stentorian
voice
of
hercules
involuntarily
broke
from
the
party
cutlasses
were
brought
into
action
and
the
clay
crumbled
away
beneath
the
vigorous
assault
that
was
made
upon
it
the
welcome
air
was
admitted
through
the
aperture
bringing
with
it
the
first
rays
of
the
rising
sun
the
summit
of
the
once
removed
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
clamber
to
the
top
whence
it
was
hoped
they
would
soon
get
away
to
some
high
ground
out
of
reach
of
the
flood
dick
was
the
first
to
mount
the
summit
but
a
cry
of
dismay
burst
from
his
lips
a
sound
only
too
well
known
to
travellers
in
africa
broke
upon
his
ear
that
sound
was
the
whizzing
of
arrows
hardly
a
hundred
yards
away
was
a
large
encampment
whilst
in
the
water
quite
close
to
the
where
he
stood
he
saw
some
long
boats
full
of
natives
from
one
of
these
had
come
the
volley
of
arrows
which
had
greeted
his
appearance
above
the
opening
of
the
cone
to
tell
his
people
what
had
happened
was
the
work
of
a
moment
he
seized
his
gun
and
made
hercules
bat
and
actæon
take
theirs
and
all
fired
simultaneously
at
the
nearest
boat
several
of
the
natives
were
seen
to
fall
but
shouts
of
defiance
were
raised
and
shots
were
fired
in
return
resistance
was
manifestly
useless
what
could
they
do
against
a
hundred
natives
they
were
assailed
on
every
hand
in
accordance
with
what
seemed
a
preconcerted
plan
they
were
carried
off
from
the
with
brutal
violence
in
two
parties
without
the
chance
of
a
farewell

sign

placed
on

were
conveyed
towards
the
camp
whilst
he
himself
with
the
five
negroes
and
old
nan
was
forced
into
another
and
taken
in
a
different
direction
twenty
natives
formed

five
boats
followed
in

rear

it
were

the

desperate
attempt

maintain
their
freedom
they
wounded
several
of
their
antagonists

would
doubtless
have
paid
their
lives
as
a
penalty
for
their
daring
if
there
had
not
been
special
orders
given
that
they
should
be
taken
alive

passage
of

soon
accomplished

had
barely
touched
the
shore
when

with
a
tremendous
bound
sprang
on
to

natives
rushed
upon
him

skulls
with

made
off

though

was
by

he
escaped
in

chapter
vii
a
slave
caravan
the
storm
of
the
previous
night
by
swelling
the
tributaries
of
the
coanza
had
caused
the
main
river
to
overflow
its
banks
the
inundation
had
entirely
changed
the
aspect
of
the
country
transforming
the
plain
into
a
lake
where
the
peaks
of
a
number
of
were
the
sole
objects
that
emerged
above
the
watery
expanse
the
coanza
which
is
one
of
the
principal
rivers
of
angola
falls
into
the
atlantic
about
a
hundred
miles
from
the
spot
at
which
the
pilgrim
was
stranded
the
stream
which
a
few
years
later
was
crossed
by
cameron
on
his
way
to
benguela
seems
destined
to
become
the
chief
highway
of
traffic
between
angola
and
the
interior
steamers
already
ply
upon
its
lower
waters
and
probably
ten
years
will
not
elapse
before
they
perform
regular
service
along
its
entire
course
dick
sands
had
been
quite
right
in
searching
northwards
for
the
navigable
stream
he
had
been
so
anxious
to
find
the
rivulet
he
had
been
following
fell
into
the
coanza
scarce
a
mile
away
and
had
it
not
been
for
this
unexpected
attack
he
and
his
friends
might
reasonably
have
hoped
to
descend
the
river
upon
a
raft
until
they
reached
one
of
the
portuguese
forts
where
steam
vessels
put
in
but
their
fate
was
ordered
otherwise
the
camp
which
dick
had
descried
from
the
was
pitched
upon
an
eminence
crowned
by
an
enormous
one
of
those
giant
trees
occasionally
found
in
central
africa
of
which
the
spreading
foliage
will
shelter
some
five
hundred
men
some
of
the
kind
of
formed
the
background
of
the
landscape
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
sycamore
the
caravan
which
had
been
referred
to
in
the
conversation
between
negoro
and
harris
had
just
made
a
halt
torn
from
their
villages
by
the
agents
of
the
alvez
the
large
troop
of
natives
was
on
its
way
to
the
market
of
kazonndé
thence
to
be
sent
as
occasion
required
either
to
the
west
coast
or
to
nyangwé
in
the
great
lake
district
to
be
dispersed
into
upper
egypt
or
zanzibar
immediately
on
reaching
the
camp
the
four
negroes
and
old
nan
were
placed
under
precisely
the
same
treatment
as
the
rest
of
the
captives
in
spite
of
a
desperate
resistance
they
were
deprived
of
their
weapons
and
fastened
two
and
two
one
behind
another
by
means
of
a
pole
about
six
feet
long
forked
at
each
end
and
attached
to
their
necks
by
an
iron
bolt
their
arms
were
left
free
that
they
might
carry
any
burdens
and
in
order
to
prevent
an
attempt
to
escape
a
heavy
chain
was
passed
round
their
waists
it
was
thus
in
single
file
unable
to
turn
either
right
or
left
they
would
have
to
march
hundreds
of
miles
goaded
along
their
toilsome
road
by
the
havildar
whip
the
lot
of
hercules
seemed
preferable
exposed
though
undoubtedly
he
would
be
in
his
flight
to
hunger
and
to
the
attacks
of
wild
beasts
and
to
all
the
perils
of
that
dreary
country
but
solitude
with
its
worst
privations
was
a
thing
to
be
envied
in
comparison
to
being
in
the
hands
of
those
pitiless
drivers
who
did
not
speak
a
word
of
the
language
of
their
victims
but
communicated
with
them
only
by
threatening
gestures
or
by
actual
violence
as
a
white
man
dick
was
not
attached
to
any
other
captive
the
drivers
were
probably
afraid
to
subject
him
to
the
same
treatment
as
the
negroes
and
he
was
left
unfettered
but
placed
under
the
strict
surveillance
of
a
havildar
at
first
he
felt
considerable
surprise
at
not
seeing
harris
or
negoro
in
the
camp
as
he
could
not
entertain
a
doubt
that
it
was
at
their
instigation
the
attack
had
been
made
upon
their
retreat
but
when
he
came
to
reflect
that
weldon
jack
and
cousin
benedict
had
not
been
allowed
to
come
with
them
but
had
been
carried
off
in
some
other
direction
he
began
to
think
it
probable
that
the
two
rascals
had
some
scheme
to
carry
out
with
regard
to
them
elsewhere
the
caravan
consisted
of
nearly
eight
hundred
including
about
five
hundred
slaves
of
both
sexes
two
hundred
soldiers
and
freebooters
and
a
considerable
number
of
havildars
and
drivers
over
whom
the
agents
acted
as
superior
officers
these
agents
are
usually
of
portuguese
or
arab
extraction
and
the
cruelties
they
inflict
upon
the
miserable
captives
are
almost
beyond
conception
they
beat
them
continually
and
if
any
unfortunate
slave
sinks
from
exhaustion
or
in
any
way
becomes
unfit
for
the
market
he
is
forthwith
either
stabbed
or
shot
as
the
result
of
this
brutality
it
rarely
happens
that
fifty
per
cent
of
the
slaves
reach
their
destination
some
few
may
contrive
to
escape
and
many
are
left
as
skeletons
along
the
line
of
route
such
of
the
agents
as
are
portuguese
are
as
it
may
well
be
imagined
of
the
very
lowest
dregs
of
society
outlaws
escaped
criminals
and
men
of
the
most
desperate
character
of
this
stamp
were
the
associates
of
negoro
and
harris
now
in
the
employ
of
josé
antonio
alvez
one
of
the
most
notorious
of
all
the
of
central
africa
and
of
whom
commander
cameron
has
given
some
curious
information
most
frequently
the
soldiers
who
escort
the
captives
are
natives
hired
by
the
dealers
but
they
do
not
possess
the
entire
monopoly
of
the
forays
made
for
the
purpose
of
securing
slaves
the
native
negro
kings
make
war
upon
each
other
with
this
express
design
and
sell
their
vanquished
antagonists
men
women
and
children
to
the
traders
for
calico
guns
gunpowder
and
red
beads
or
in
times
of
famine
according
to
livingstone
even
for
a
few
grains
of
maize
the
escort
of
old
alvez
caravan
was
an
average
specimen
of
these
african
soldiers
it
was
simply
a
horde
of
banditti
carrying
old
muskets
the
barrels
of
which
were
decorated
with
copper
rings
the
agents
are
very
often
put
to
their
wits
end
to
know
how
to
manage
them
their
orders
are
called
in
question
halts
are
continually
demanded
and
in
order
to
avert
desertion
they
are
frequently
obliged
to
yield
to
the
obstreperous
will
of
their
undisciplined
force
although
the
slaves
both
male
and
female
are
compelled
to
carry
burdens
whilst
on
their
march
a
certain
number
of
porters
called
is
specially
engaged
to
carry
the
more
valuable
merchandize
and
principally
the
ivory
tusks
occasionally
weigh
as
much
as
and
require
two
men
to
carry
them
to
the
dépôts
whence
they
are
sent
to
the
markets
of
khartoom
natal
and
zanzibar
on
their
arrival
the
are
paid
by
the
dealers
according
to
contract
which
is
generally
either
by
about
twenty
yards
of
the
cotton
stuff
known
as
or
by
a
little
powder
by
a
handful
or
two
of
cowries
by
some
beads
or
if
all
these
be
scarce
they
are
paid
by
being
allotted
some
of
the
slaves
who
are
otherwise
unsalable
among
the
five
hundred
slaves
in
the
caravan
very
few
were
at
all
advanced
in
years
the
explanation
of
this
circumstance
was
that
whenever
a
raid
is
made
and
a
village
is
set
on
fire
every
inhabitant
above
the
age
of
forty
is
mercilessly
massacred
or
hung
upon
the
neighbouring
trees
only
the
children
and
young
adults
of
both
sexes
are
reserved
for
the
market
and
as
these
constitute
only
a
small
proportion
of
the
vanquished
some
idea
may
be
formed
of
the
frightful
depopulation
which
these
vast
districts
of
equinoctial
africa
are
undergoing
nothing
could
be
more
pitiable
than
the
condition
of
this
miserable
herd
all
alike
were
destitute
of
clothing
having
nothing
on
them
but
a
few
strips
of
the
stuff
known
as
made
from
the
bark
of
trees
many
of
the
women
were
covered
with
bleeding
wounds
from
the
drivers
lashes
and
had
their
feet
lacerated
by
the
constant
friction
of
the
road
but
in
addition
to
other
burdens
were
compelled
to
carry
their
own
emaciated
children
young
men
too
there
were
who
had
lost
their
voices
from
exhaustion
and
who
to
use
livingstone
expression
had
been
reduced
to
ebony
skeletons
by
toiling
under
the
yoke
of
the
fork
which
is
far
more
galling
than
the
it
was
a
sight
that
might
have
moved
the
most
but
yet
there
was
no
symptom
of
compassion
on
the
part
of
those
arab
and
portuguese
drivers
whom
cameron
pronounces
worse
than
brutes
footnote
cameron

order
to
obtain
the
fifty

the
majority
either
perished
in

slain
in
defending

in

the
crimes
which
are
perpetuated
in
africa
by
men
who
call
themselves

seem
incredible
to
the
inhabitants
of
civilized
countries
it
is
impossible
that

at

can
be
aware
of
the
atrocities
committed
by

who
boast
of

assertions
of

loud
protestations

the

was
so
strict
that
dick
sands
felt
it
would
be
utterly
useless
for
him
to
make
any
attempt
to
seek
for
weldon
she
and
her
son
had
doubtless
been
carried
off
by
negoro
and
his
heart
sank
when
he
thought
of
the
dangers
to
which
too
probably
she
would
be
exposed
again
and
again
he
repeated
his
reproaches
on
himself
that
he
had
ever
allowed
either
negoro
or
harris
to
escape
his
hands
neither
weldon
nor
jack
could
expect
the
least
assistance
from
cousin
benedict
the
good
man
was
barely
able
to
consult
for
himself
all
three
of
them
would
he
conjectured
be
conveyed
to
some
remote
district
of
angola
the
poor
mother
like
some
miserable
slave
would
insist
upon
carrying
her
own
sick
son
until
her
strength
failed
her
and
exhausted
by
her
endurances
she
sank
down
helpless
on
the
way
a
prisoner
and
powerless
to
help
the
very
thought
was
itself
a
torture
to
poor
dick
even
dingo
was
gone
it
would
have
been
a
satisfaction
to
have
had
the

to
send
off
upon
the
track
of
the
lost
ones
one
only
hope
remained
hercules
still
was
free
all
that
human
strength
could
attempt
in
weldon
behalf
hercules
would
not
fail
to
try
perhaps
too
under
cover
of
the
night
it
was
not
altogether
improbable
that
the
stalwart
negro
would
mingle
with
the
crowd
of
negroes
amongst
whom
his
dark
skin
would
enable
him
to
pass
unnoticed
and
make
his
way
to
dick
himself
then
might
not
the
two
together
elude
the
vigilance
of
the
watch
might
they
not
follow
after
and
overtake
weldon
in
the
forest
would
they
not
perchance
be
able
either
by
stealth
or
by
force
to
liberate
her
and
once
free
they
would
effect
an
escape
to
the
river
and
finally
accomplish
the
undertaking
in
which
they
had
been
so
lamentably
frustrated
such
were
the
sanguine
visions
in
which
dick
permitted
himself
to
indulge
his
temperament
overcame
all
tendency
to
despair
and
kept
him
alive
to
the
faintest
chance
of
deliverance
the
next
thing
of
importance
was
to
ascertain
the
destination
of
the
caravan
it
was
a
matter
of
the
most
serious
moment
whether
the
convoy
of
slaves
were
going
to
be
carried
to
one
of
the
dépôts
of
angola
or
whether
they
were
to
be
sent
hundreds
of
miles
into
the
interior
to
nyangwe
in
the
heart
of
the
great
lake
district
that
livingstone
was
then
exploring
to
reach
the
latter
spot
would
occupy
some
months
and
to
return
thence
to
the
coast
even
if
they
should
be
fortunate
enough
to
regain
their
liberty
would
be
a
work
of
insuperable
difficulty
he
was
not
long
left
in
suspense
although
he
could
not
understand
the
dialect
that
was
used
by
the
leaders
of
the
caravan
he
noticed
that
the
word
kazonndé
occurred
very
frequently
and
knowing
it
as
the
name
of
an
important
market
in
the
province
he
naturally
concluded
that
it
was
there
the
slaves
were
to
be
disposed
of
whether
for
the
advantage
of
the
king
of
the
district
or
of
one
of
the
rich
traders
he
had
no
means
of
telling
unless
his
geographical
knowledge
was
at
fault
he
was
aware
that
kazonndé
must
be
about
miles
from
paul
de
loanda
and
consequently
that
it
could
hardly
be
more
than
miles
from
the
part
of
the
coanza
where
they
were
now
encamped
under
favourable
circumstances
it
was
a
journey
that
could
not
be
accomplished
in
less
than
twelve
or
fourteen
days
but
allowing
for
the
retarded
progress
of
a
caravan
already
exhausted
by
a
lengthened
march
dick
was
convinced
that
they
could
not
reach
the
place
for
at
least
three
weeks
he
was
most
anxious
to
communicate
to
his
companions
in
adversity
his
impression
that
they
were
not
to
be
carried
into
the
heart
of
the
country
and
began
to
cogitate
whether
some
plan
could
not
be
devised
for
exchanging
a
few
words
with
them
forked
together
as
it
has
been
said
two
and
two
the
four
negroes
were
at
the
extremity
of
the
camp
bat
attached
to
his
father
austin
to
actæon
a
havildar
with
twelve
soldiers
formed
their
guard
dick
at
first
was
about
fifty
yards
away
from
the
group
but
being
left
free
to
move
about
contrived
gradually
to
diminish
the
distance
between
himself
and
them
tom
seemed
to
apprehend
his
intention
and
whispered
a
word
to
his
companions
that
they
should
be
on
the
without
moving
they
were
all
on
their
guard
in
a
moment
dick
careful
to
conceal
his
design
strolled
backward
with
a
feigned
indifference
and
succeeded
in
getting
so
near
that
he
might
have
called
out
and
informed
tom
that
they
were
going
to
kazonndé
but
he
was
desirous
of
accomplishing
more
than
this
he
wanted
to
get
an
opportunity
of
having
some
conversation
as
to
their
future
plans
and
he
ventured
to
approach
still
nearer
his
heart
beat
high
as
he
believed
he
was
on
the
point
of
attaining
his
object
when
all
at
once
the
havildar
becoming
aware
of
his
design
rushed
upon
him
like
a
madman
summoned
some
soldiers
and
with
considerable
violence
sent
him
back
to
the
front
tom
and
the
others
were
quickly
removed
to
another
part
of
the
encampment
exasperated
by
the
rough
attack
that
was
made
upon
him
dick
had
seized
the
havildar
gun
and
broken
it
almost
wrenching
it
from
his
hands
when
several
soldiers
simultaneously
assailed
him
and
would
have
struck
him
down
and
killed
him
upon
the
spot
had
not
one
of
the
chiefs
an
arab
of
huge
stature
and
ferocious
countenance
interfered
to
stop
them
this
arab
was
the
ibn
hamish
of
whom
harris
had
spoken
to
negoro
he
said
a
few
words
which
dick
could
not
understand
and
the
soldiers
with
manifest
reluctance
relaxed
their
hold
and
retired
it
was
evident
that
although
dick
was
not
to
be
permitted
to
hold
any
communication
with
the
rest
of
his
party
orders
had
been
given
that
his
life
was
to
be
protected
illustration
the
start
was
made
it
was
now
nine
and
the
beating
of
drums
and
the
blowing
of
coodoo
horns
gave
the
signal
that
the
morning
march
was
to
be
continued
instantly
chiefs
soldiers
porters
and
slaves
were
upon
their
feet
and
arranged
themselves
in
their
various
groups
with
a
havildar
bearing
a
banner
at
their
head
footnote
coodoo
a
ruminant
common
in
africa
the
order
was
given
the
start
was
made
a
strange
song
was
heard
rising
in
the
air
it
was
a
song
not
of
the
victors
but
of
the
vanquished
the
slaves
were
chanting
an
imprecation
on
their
oppressors
and
the
burden
of
the
chorus
was
that
captured
tortured
slain
after
death
they
would
return
and
avenge
their
wrongs
upon
their
murderers

by

the
storm
of
the
preceding

now
passed
away

the
sky
was
still

the
weather
far
from

was
the
of

time
of
the
or
second
period
of
the
rainy

that
for
the
next
two
or
three
weeks
the
nights
might
be
expected
to
be
wet
on
leaving
the
banks
of

the
caravan

due
east
soldiers
marched
at
the
head
and
in
the
rear
as
well
as
upon
the
flanks
of
the
troop
any
escape
of
the
prisoners
therefore
even
if
they
had
not
been
loaded
with
their
fetters
would
have
been
utterly
impossible
they
were
all
driven
along
without
any
attempt
at
order
the
havildars
using
their
whips
unsparingly
upon
them
whenever
they
showed
signs

be

on

to
the
caravan
and
was
here
there
and
everywhere
not
moved
in
the
least
by
the
sufferings
of
the
captives
but
obliged
to
be
attentive
to
the
importunities
of
the
soldiers
and
porters
who
were
perpetually
clamouring
for
extra
rations
or
demanding
an
immediate
halt
loud
were
the
discussions
that
arose
and
the
uproar
became
positively
deafening
when
the
quarrelsome
voices
rose
above
the
shrieks
of
the
slaves
many
of
whom
found
themselves
treading
upon
soil
already
stained
by
the
blood
of
the
ranks

ever
the
havildar
strolled
a
few
yards
away

took
the
opportunity

poor
old

away

the
opportunity

tried

the

path
for
him
and
to
relax
the
pace

suit
his
enfeebled
limbs

tears
rolled
down

cheeks
when
he
found
that
his
son
efforts
only
resulted
in
bringing
down
upon

back
some
sharp
cuts
of
the
havildar
whip
actæon
and
austin
subject
to
hardly
less
brutality
followed
a
few
steps
behind
but
all
four
could
not
help
feeling
envious
at
the
luck
of
hercules
who
might
have
dangers
to
encounter
but
at
least
had
his
liberty
immediately
upon
their
capture
tom
had
revealed
to
his
companions
the
fact
that
they
were
in
africa
and
informing
them
how
they
had
been
betrayed
by
harris
made
them

that
they
had
no
mercy
to
expect
old
nan
had
been
placed
amongst
a
group
of
women
in
the
central
ranks
she
was
chained
to
a
young
mother
with
two
children
the
one
at
the
breast
the
other
only
three
years
old
and
scarcely
able
to
walk
moved
by
compassion
nan
took
the
little
one
into
her
own
arms
thus
not
only
saving
it
from
fatigue
but
from
the
blows
it
would
very
likely
have
received
for
lagging
behind
the
mother
shed
tears
of
gratitude
but
the
weight
was
almost
too
much
for
nan
strength
and
she
felt
as
if
she
must
break
down
under
her
burden
she
thought
fondly
of
little
jack
and
imagining
him
borne
along
in
the
arms
of
his
weary
mother
could
not
help
asking
herself
whether
she
should
ever
see
him
or
her
kind
mistress
again
far
in
the
rear
dick
could
not
see
the
head
of
the
caravan
except
occasionally
when
the
ground
was
rather
on
the
rise
the
voices
of
the
agents
and
drivers
harsh
and
excited
as
they
were
scarcely
roused
him
from
his
melancholy
reflections
his
thoughts
were
not
of
himself
nor
of
his
own
sufferings
his
whole
attention
was
absorbed
in
looking
for
some
traces
of
weldon
progress
if
she
too
was
being
taken
to
kazonndé
her
route
must
also
lie
this
way
but
he
could
discover
no
trace
of
her
having
been
conducted
by
this
line
of
march
and
could
only
hope
that
she
was
being
spared
the
cruelties
which
he
was
himself
witnessing
the
forest
extended
for
about
twenty
miles
to
the
east
of
the
coanza
but
whether
it
was
that
the
trees
had
been
destroyed
by
the
ravages
of
insects
or
broken
down
before
they
had
made
their
growth
by
being
trampled
on
by
elephants
they
were
growing
much
less
thickly
than
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
river
there
were
numbers
of
seven
or
eight
feet
high
from
which
are
manufactured
the
striped
stuffs
that
are
worn
in
the
interior
of
the
province
but
upon
the
whole
progress
was
not
much
impeded
either
by
shrubs
or
underwood
occasionally
the
caravan
plunged
into
jungles
of
reeds
like
bamboos
their
stalks
an
inch
in
diameter
so
tall
that
only
an
elephant
or
giraffe
could
have
reared
above
them
and
through
which
none
excepting
such
as
had
a
very
intimate
knowledge
of
the
country
could
possibly
have
made
their
way
starting
every
morning
at
daybreak
they
marched
till
noon
when
an

halt
was
made
packets
of
manioc

unfastened

quantities

when
the
soldiers
had
plundered

village
a
little
goat
flesh
or
some
sweet
potatoes

added

meal

generally
the
fatigue
aggravated
by
inadequate
rest
took
away
the
appetite

hardly
eat

prowled
in

heard
their
roars

trembled
as
he
thought
of
hercules
nevertheless
had
the
opportunity
offered
itself

not
for

word
negoro
in
a
way
that
convinced
me
that
it
is
under
the
direction
of
the
portuguese
that
i
am
subject
to
this
hard
indignity

it

last
night
encamped
under
some
large
trees
on
the
skirts
of
a
forest
several
escaped
prisoners
recaptured
their
punishment
barbarously
cruel
loud
roaring
of
lions
and
hyenas
heard
at
nightfall
also
snorting
of
hippopotamuses
probably
some
lake

not

off
tired
but
could
not
sleep
heard
a
rustling
in
the
grass
felt
sure
that
something
was
going
to
attack
me
what
could
i
do
i
had
no
gun
for
weldon
sake
must
if
possible
preserve
my
life
the
night
was
dark
no
moon
two
eyes
gleamed
upon
me
i
was
about
to
utter
a
cry
of
alarm
fortunately
i
suppressed
it
the
creature
that
had
sprung
to
my
feet
was
dingo
the
dog
licked
my
hands
all
over
persisting
in
rubbing
his
neck
against
them
evidently
to
make
me
feel
there
found
a
reed
fastened
to
the
collar
upon
which
the
initials
had
so
often
awakened
our
curiosity
breaking
open
the
reed
i
took
a
note
from
inside
it
was
too
dark
for
me
to
see
to
read
it
i
tried
by
caressing
dingo
to
detain
him
but
the
dog
appeared
to
know
that
his
mission
with
me
was
at
an
end
he
licked
my
hands
affectionately
made
a
sudden
bound
and
disappeared
in
the
long
grass
as
mysteriously
as
he
had
come
the
howling
of
the
wild
beasts
increased
how
i
dreaded
that
the
faithful
creature
would
become
their
prey
no
more
sleep
this
night
for
me
it
seemed
that
daylight
would
never
dawn
at
length
it
broke
with
the
suddenness
that
marks
a
tropical
morn
i
was
able
cautiously
to
read
my
note
the
handwriting
i
knew
at
a
glance
was

were

chapter
ix
kazonndé
by
the
of
may
when
the
caravan
reached
kazonndé
the
number
of
the
slaves
had
diminished
by
more
than
half
so
numerous
had
been
the
casualties
along
the
road
but
the
dealers
were
quite
prepared
to
make
a
market
of
their
loss
the
demand
for
slaves
was
very
great
and
the
price
must
be
raised
accordingly
angola
at
that
time
was
the
scene
of
a
large

as
the
caravans
principally
wended
their
way
towards
the
interior
the
portuguese
authorities
at
loanda
and
benguela
had
practically
no
power
to
prevent
it
the
barracks
on
the
shore
were
crowded
to
overflowing
with
prisoners
the
few
that
managed
to
elude
the
cruisers
being
quite
inadequate
to
embark
the
whole
number

subsequently
met
him
it
consisted
of

long
street
on

were

adjoining
the

was
the
royal
residence
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
collection
of
dirty
huts
extending
over
an
area
of
nearly
a
square
mile
some
of
these
huts
were
unenclosed
others
were
surrounded
by
a
palisade
of
reeds
or
by
a
hedge
of
bushy
figs
in
an

within
a

were
about
thirty

loftier
than
the
rest
the
abode
of
the
monarch
himself
he
had
sorely
declined
from
the
dignity
and
importance
of
his
predecessors
and
his
army
which
by
the
early
portuguese
traders
had
been
estimated
at
now
numbered
less
than
men
no
longer
could
he
afford
as
in
the
good
old
time
to
order
a
sacrifice
of
or
thirty
slaves
at
one
offering
his
name
was
moené
loonga
little
over
fifty
he
was
prematurely
aged
by
drink
and
debauchery
and
scarcely
better
than
a
maniac
his
subjects
officers
and
ministers
were
all
liable
to
be
mutilated
at
his
pleasure
and
noses
and
ears
feet
and
hands
were
cut
off
unsparingly
whenever
his
caprice
so
willed
it
his
death
would
have
been
a
cause
of
regret
to
no
one
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
alvez
who
was
on
very
good
terms
with
him
alvez
moreover
feared
that
in
the
event
of
the
present
king
death
the
succession
of
his
chief
wife
queen
moena
might
be
disputed
and
that
his
dominions
would
be
invaded
by
a
younger
and
more
active
neighbour
one
of
the
kings
of
ukusu
who
had
already
seized
upon
some
villages
dependent
on
the
government
of
kazonndé
and
who
was
in
alliance
with
a
rival
trader
named
a
man
of
pure
arab
extraction
from
whom
cameron
afterwards
received
a
visit
at
nyangwé
to
all
intents
and
purposes
alvez
was
the
real
sovereign
of
the
district
having
fostered
the
vices
of
the
brutalized
king
till
he
had
him
completely
in
his
power
he
was
a
man
considerably
advanced
in
years
he
was
not
as
his
name
might
imply
a
white
man
but
had
merely
assumed
his
portuguese
title
for
purposes
of
business
his
true
name
was
kendélé
and
he
was
a
pure
negro
by
birth
being
a
native
of
dondo
on
the
coanza
he
had
commenced
life
as
a
agent
and
was
now
on
his
way
towards
becoming
a
trader
that
is
to
say
he
was
a
consummate
rascal
under
the
guise
of
an
honest
man
he
it
was
whom
cameron
met
at
the
end
of
at
kilemba
the
capital
of
urua
of
which
kasongo
is
chief
and
with
whose
caravan
he
travelled
to
bihé
a
distance
of
seven
hundred
miles
it
was
midday
when
the
caravan
entered
kazonndé
the
journey
from
the
coanza
had
lasted
days
more
than
five
weeks
of
misery
as
great
as
was
within
human
power
to
endure
amidst
the
noise
of
drums
and
the
slaves
were
conducted
to
the
marketplace
the
soldiers
of
the
caravan
discharged
their
guns
into
the
air
and
old
alvez
resident
retinue
responded
with
a
similar
salute
the
bandits
than
which
the
soldiers
were
nothing
better
were
delighted
to
meet
again
and
would
celebrate
their
return
by
a
season
of
riot
and
excess
the
slaves
reduced
to
a
total
of
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
were
many
of
them
almost
dead
from
exhaustion
the
forks
were
removed
from
their
necks
though
the
chains
were
still
retained
and
the
whole
of
them
were
driven
into
barracks
that
were
unfit
even
for
cattle
to
await
in
company
with
to
other
captives
already
there
the
great
market
which
would
be
held
two
days
hence
the
after
delivering
their
loads
of
ivory
would
only
stay
to
receive
their
payment
of
a
few
yards
of
calico
or
other
stuff
and
would
then
depart
at
once
to
join
some
other
caravan
on
being
relieved
from
the
forks
which
they
had
carried
for
so
many
weary
days
tom
and
his
companions
heartily
wrung
each
other
hands
but
they
could
not
venture
to
utter
one
word
of
mutual
encouragement
the
three
younger
men
more
full
of
life
and
vigour
had
resisted
the
effects
of
the
fatigue
but
poor
old
tom
was
nearly
exhausted
and
had
the
march
been
protracted
for
a
few
more
days
he
must
have
shared
fate
and
been
left
behind
a
prey
to
the
wild
beasts
upon
their
arrival
all
four
were
packed
into
a
narrow
cell
where
some
food
was
provided
and
the
door
was
immediately
locked
upon
them
the
was
now
almost
deserted
and
dick
sands
was
left
there
under
the
special
charge
of
a
havildar
he
lost
no
opportunity
of
peering
into
every
hut
in
the
hope
of
catching
a
glimpse
of
weldon
who
if
hercules
had
not
misinformed
him
had
come
on
hither
just
in
front
but
he
was
very
much
perplexed
he
could
well
understand
that
weldon
if
still
a
prisoner
would
be
kept
out
of
sight
but
why
negoro
and
harris
did
not
appear
to
triumph
over
him
in
his
humiliation
was
quite
a
mystery
to
him
it
was
likely
enough
that
the
presence
of
either
one
or
the
other
of
them
would
be
the
signal
for
himself
to
be
exposed
to
fresh
indignity
or
even
to
torture
but
dick
would
have
welcomed
the
sight
of
them
at
kazonndé
were
it
only
as
an
indication
that
weldon
and
jack
were
there
also
it
disappointed
him
too
that
dingo
did
not
come
back
ever
since
the
dog
had
brought
him
the
first
note
he
had
kept
an
answer
written
ready
to
send
to
hercules
imploring
him
to
look
after
weldon
and
to
keep
him
informed
of
everything
he
began
to
fear
that
the
faithful
creature
must
be
dead
perhaps
perished
in
some
attempt
to
reach
himself
it
was
however
quite
possible
that
hercules
had
taken
the
dog
in
some
other
direction
hoping
to
gain
somedépôt
in
the
interior
but
so
thoroughly
had
dick
persuaded
himself
that
weldon
had
preceded
him
to
kazonndé
that
his
disappointment
became
more
and
more
keen
when
he
failed
to
discover
her
for
a
while
he
seemed
to
yield
to
despair
and
sat
down
sorrowful
and
sick
at
heart
suddenly
a
chorus
of
voices
and
trumpets
broke
upon
his
ear
he
was
startled
into
taking
a
new
interest
in
what
was
going
on
alvez
alvez
was
the
cry
again
and
again
repeated
by
the
crowd
here
then
was
the
great
man
himself
about
to
appear
was
it
not
likely
that
harris
or
negoro
might
be
with
him
dick
stood
erect
and
resolute
his
eye
vivid
with
expectation
he
felt
all
eagerness
to
stand
face
to
face
with
his
betrayers
boy
as
he
was
he
was
equal
to
cope
with
them
both
the
which
came
in
sight
at
the
end
of
the
street
was
nothing
more
than
a
kind
of
hammock
covered
by
a
faded
and
ragged
curtain
an
old
negro
stepped
out
of
it
his
attendants
greeted
him
with
noisy
acclamations
this
then
was
the
great
trader
josé
antonio
alvez
immediately
following
him
was
his
friend
coïmbra
son
of
the
chief
coïmbra
of
bihé
and
according
to
cameron
the
greatest
blackguard
in
the
province
this
sworn
ally
of
alvez
this
organizer
of
his
this
commander
worthy
of
his
own
horde
of
bandits
was
utterly
loathsome
in
his
appearance
his
flesh
was
filthily
dirty
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
his
skin
yellow
and
his
long
hair
all
dishevelled
he
had
no
other
attire
than
a
tattered
shirt
a
tunic
made
of
grass
and
a
battered
straw
hat
under
which
his
countenance
appeared
like
that
of
some
old
hag
alvez
himself
whose
clothes
were
like
those
of
an
old
turk
the
day
after
a
carnival
was
one
degree
more
respectable
in
appearance
than
his
satellite
not
that
his
looks
spoke
much
for
the
very
highest
class
of
african
to
dick
great
disappointment
neither
harris
nor
negoro
was
among
his
retinue
both
alvez
and
coïmbra
shook
hands
with
ibn
hamish
the
leader
of
the
caravan
and
congratulated
him
on
the
success
of
the
expedition
alvez
made
a
grimace
on
being
told
that
half
the
slaves
had
died
on
the
way
but
on
the
whole
he
seemed
satisfied
he
could
meet
the
demand
that
at
present
existed
and
would
lose
no
time
in
bartering
the
new
arrival
for
ivory
or
copper
in
the
shape
of
a
andrew
cross
the
form
in
which
the
metal
is
exported
in
central
africa
after
complimenting
the
havildars
upon
the
way
in
which
they
had
done
their
work
the
trader
gave
orders
that
the
porters
should
be
paid
and
dismissed
the
conversations
were
carried
on
in
a
mixture
of
portuguese
and
native
idioms
in
which
the
african
element
abounded
so
largely
that
a
native
of
lisbon
would
have
been
at
a
loss
to
understand
them
dick
of
course
could
not
comprehend
what
was
said
and
it
was
only
when
he
saw
a
havildar
go
towards
the
cell
in
which
tom
and
the
others
were
confined
that
he
realized
that
the
talk
was
about
himself
and
his
party
when
the
negroes
were
brought
out
dick
came
close
up
being
anxious
to
learn
as
much
as
he
could
of
what
was
in
contemplation
the
old
trader
eyes
seemed
to
brighten
as
he
glanced
upon
the
three
strapping
young
men
who
he
knew
would
soon
be
restored
to
their
full
strength
by
rest
and
proper
food
they
at
least
would
get
a
good
price
as
for
poor
old
tom
he
was
manifestly
so
broken
down
by
infirmity
and
age
that
he
would
have
no
value
in
the
market
in
a
few
words
of
broken
english
which
alvez
had
picked
up
from
some
of
his
agents
he
ironically
gave
them
all
a
welcome
glad
to
see
you
he
said
with
a
diabolical
grin
tom
knew
what
he
meant
and
drew
himself
up
proudly
we
are
free
men
he
protested
free
citizens
of
the
united
states
yes
yes
replied
alvez
grinning
you
are
americans
very
glad
to
see
you
very
glad
to
see
you
echoed
coïmbra
and
walking
up
to
austin
he
felt
his
chest
and
shoulders
and
then
proceeded
to
open
his
mouth
in
order
to
examine
his
teeth
a
blow
from
austin
powerful
fist
sent
the
satellite
staggering
backwards
some
soldiers
made
a
dash
and
seized
the
young
negro
evidently
ready
to
make
him
pay
dearly
for
his
temerity
but
alvez
was
by
no
means
willing
to
have
any
injury
done
to
his
property
and
called
them
off
he
hardly
attempted
to
conceal
his
amusement
at
coïmbra
discomfiture
although
the
blow
had
cost
him
one
of
his
front
teeth
after
he
had
recovered
somewhat
from
the
shock
coïmbra
stood
scowling
at
austin
as
if
mentally
vowing
vengeance
on
some
future
occasion
dick
sands
was
now
himself
brought
forward
in
the
custody
of
a
havildar
it
was
clear
that
alvez
had
been
told
all
about
him
for
after
scanning
him
for
a
moment
he
stammered
out
in
his
broken
english
ah
ah
the
little
yankee
yes
replied
dick
i
see
you
know
who
i
am
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
and
my
friends
yankee
little
yankee
repeated
the
trader
who
either
did
not
or
would
not
comprehend
the
meaning
of
dick
question
dick
turned
to
coïmbra
and
made
the
same
inquiry
of
him
in
spite
of
his
degraded
features
now
still
farther
disfigured
by
being
swollen
from
the
blow
it
was
easy
to
recognize
that
he
was
not
of
native
origin
he
refused
to
answer
a
word
and
only
stared
again
with
the
vicious
glare
of
malevolence
meanwhile
alvez
had
begun
to
talk
to
ibn
hamish
dick
felt
sure
that
they
intended
to
separate
him
from
the
negroes
and
accordingly
took
the
opportunity
of
whispering
a
few
words
to
them
my
friends
i
have
heard
from
hercules
dingo
brought
me
a
note
from
him
tied
round
his
neck
he
says
harris
and
negoro
have
carried
off
weldon
jack
and
benedict
he
did
not
know
where
have
patience
and
we
will
find
them
yet
illustration
with
a
yell
and
a
curse
the
american
fell
dead
at
his
feet
and
where
nan
muttered
tom
in
a
low
voice
dead
replied
dick
and
was
about
to
add
more
when
a
hand
was
laid
upon
his
shoulder
and
a
voice
that
he
knew
too
well
exclaimed
well
my
young
friend
how
are
you
i
am
glad
to
see
you
again
he
turned
round
quickly
harris
stood
before
him
where
is
mrs
weldon
asked
dick
impetuously
ah
poor
thing
answered
harris
with
an
air
of
deep
commiseration
what
is
she
dead
dick
almost
shrieked
where
is
her
child
poor
little
fellow
said
harris
in
the
same
mournful
tone
these
insinuations
that
those
in
whose
welfare
he
was
so
deeply
interested
had
succumbed
to
the
hardships
of
the
journey
awoke
in
dick
mind
a
sudden
and
irresistible
desire
for
vengeance
darting
forwards
he
seized
the
cutlass
that
harris
wore
in
his
belt
and
plunged
it
into
his
heart
with
a
yell
and
a
curse
the
american
fell
dead
at
his
feet
chapter
so
sudden
was
dick
action
that
it
had
been
impossible
to
parry
his
blow
several
of
the
natives
rushed
on
him
and
in
all
likelihood
would
have
struck
him
down
upon
the
spot
had
not
negoro
arrived
at
that
very
moment
at
a
sign
from
him
the
natives
drew
back
and
proceeded
to
raise
and
carry
away
harris
corpse
alvez
and
coïmbra
were
urgent
in
their
demand
that
dick
should
forthwith
be
punished
by
death
but
negoro
whispered
to
them
that
they
would
assuredly
be
the
gainers
by
delay
and
they
accordingly
contented
themselves
with
ordering
the
youth
to
be
placed
under
strict
supervision
this
was
the
first
time
that
dick
had
set
eyes
upon
negoro
since
he
had
left
the
coast
nevertheless
so
heartbroken
was
he
at
the
intelligence
he
had
just
received
that
he
did
not
deign
to
address
a
word
to
the
man
whom
he
knew
to
be
the
real
author
of
all
his
misery
he
cared
not
now
what
became
of
him
loaded
with
chains
he
was
placed
in
the
dungeon
where
alvez
was
accustomed
to
confine
slaves
who
had
been
condemned
to
death
for
mutiny
or
violence
that
he
had
no
communication
with
the
outer
world
gave
him
no
concern
he
had
avenged
the
death
of
those
for
whose
safety
he
had
felt
himself
responsible
and
could
now
calmly
await
the
fate
which
he
could
not
doubt
was
in
store
for
him
he
did
not
dare
to
suppose
that
he
had
been
temporarily
spared
otherwise
than
that
he
might
suffer
the
cruellest
tortures
that
native
ingenuity
could
devise
that
the
pilgrim
cook
now
held
in
his
power
the
boy
captain
he
so
thoroughly
hated
was
warrant
enough
that
the
sternest
possible
measure
of
vengeance
would
be
exacted
illustration
accompanied
by
coïmbra
alvez
himself
was
one
of
the
first
arrivals
two
days
later
the
great
market
the
commenced
although
many
of
the
principal
traders
were
there
from
the
interior
it
was
by
no
means
exclusively
a
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
natives
from
the
neighbouring
provinces
assembled
to
dispose
of
the
various
products
of
the
country
quite
early
the
great
of
kazonndé
was
all
alive
with
a
bustling
concourse
of
little
under
five
thousand
people
including
the
slaves
of
old
alvez
amongst
whom
were
tom
and
his
three
partners
in
adversity
an
item
by
no
means
inconsiderable
in
the
dealer
stock
accompanied
by
coïmbra
alvez
himself
was
one
of
the
first
arrivals
he
was
going
to
sell
his
slaves
in
lots
to
be
conveyed
in
caravans
into
the
interior
the
dealers
for
the
most
part
consisted
of
from
ujiji
the
principal
market
on
lake
tanganyika
whilst
some
of
a
superior
class
were
manifestly
arabs
the
natives
that
were
assembled
were
of
both
sexes
and
of
every
variety
of
age
the
women
in
particular
displaying
an
aptitude
in
making
bargains
that
is
shared
by
their
sisters
elsewhere
of
a
lighter
hue
and
it
may
be
said
that
no
market
of
the
most
civilized
region
could
be
characterized
by
greater
excitement
or
animation
for
amongst
the
savages
of
africa
the
customer
makes
his
offer
in
equally
noisy
terms
as
the
vendor
the

always
considered
a
kind
of
consequently
the
natives
of
both
sexes
though
their
clothing
was
scanty
in
extent
made
a
point
of
appearing
in
a
most
lavish
display
of
ornaments
their
was
most
remarkable
the
men
had
their
hair
arranged
in
every
variety
of
eccentric
device
some
had
it
divided
into
four
parts
rolled
over
cushions
and
fastened
into
a
chignon
or
mounted
in
front
into
a
bunch
of
tails
adorned
with
red
feathers
others
plastered
it
thickly
with
a
mixture
of
red
mud
and
oil
similar
to
that
used
for
greasing
machinery
and
formed
it
into
cones
or
lumps
into
which
they
inserted
a
medley
of
iron
pins
and
ivory
skewers
whilst
the
greatest
dandies
had
a
glass
bead
threaded
upon
every
single
hair
the
whole
being
fastened
together
by
a
driven
through
the
glittering
mass
as
a
general
rule
the
women
preferred
dressing
their
hair
in
little
tufts
about
the
size
of
a
cherry
arranging
it
into
the
shape
of
a
cap
with
corkscrew
ringlets
on
each
side
of
the
face
some
wore
it
simply
hanging
down
their
backs
others
in
french
fashion
with
a
fringe
across
the
forehead
but
every
without
exception
was
daubed
and
caked
either
with
the
mixture
of
mud
and
grease
or
with
a
bright
red
extract
of
called
but
it
was
not
only
on
their
heads
that
they
made
this
extraordinary
display
of
ornaments
the
lobes
of
their
ears
were
loaded
till
they
reached
their
shoulders
with
a
profusion
of
wooden
pegs
copper
rings
grains
of
maize
or
little
gourds
which
served
the
purpose
of
their
necks
arms
wrists
legs
and
ankles
were
a
perfect
mass
of
brass
and
copper
rings
or
sometimes
were
covered
with
a
lot
of
bright
buttons
rows
of
red
beads
called
or
seemed
also
very
popular
as
they
had
no
pockets
they
attached
their
knives
pipes
and
other
articles
to
various
parts
of
their
body
so
that
altogether
in
their
holiday
attire
the
rich
men
of
the
district
might
not
inappropriately
be
compared
to
walking
shrines
with
their
teeth
they
had
all
played
the
strangest
of
vagaries
the
upper
and
lower
incisors
had
generally
been
extracted
and
the
others
had
been
filed
to
points
or
carved
into
hooks
like
the
fangs
of
a
their
fingernails
were
allowed
to
grow
to
such
an
immoderate
length
as
to
render
the
hands
useless
and
their
swarthy
skins
were
tattooed
with
figures
of
trees
birds
crescents
and
discs
or
not
unfrequently
with
those
zigzag
lines
which
livingstone
thinks
he
recognizes
as
resembling
those
observed
in
ancient
egyptian
drawings
the
tattooing
is
effected
by
means
of
a
blue
substance
inserted
into
incisions
previously
made
in
the
skin
every
child
is
tattooed
in
precisely
the
same
pattern
as
his
father
before
him
and
thus
it
may
always
be
ascertained
to
what
family
he
belongs
instead
of
carrying
his
armorial
bearings
upon
his
plate
or
upon
the
panels
of
his
carriage
the
african
magnate
wears
them
emblazoned
on
his
own
bosom
the
garments
that
were
usually
worn
were
simply
aprons
of
descending
to
the
knees
but
occasionally
a
short
petticoat
might
be
seen
made
of
woven
grass
and
dyed
with
bright
colours
the
ladies
not
unfrequently
wore
girdles
of
beads
attached
to
green
skirts
embroidered
with
silk
and
ornamented
with
bits
of
glass
or
cowries
or
sometimes
the
skirts
were
made
of
the
grass
cloth
called
which
in
blue
yellow
or
black
is
so
much
valued
by
the
people
of
zanzibar
garments
of
these
pretensions
however
always
indicated
that
the
wearers
belonged
to
the
upper
classes
the
lower
orders
such
as
the
smaller
dealers
as
well
as
the
slaves
had
hardly
any
clothes
at
all
the
women
commonly
acted
as
porters
and
arrived
at
the
market
with
huge
baskets
on
their
backs
which
they
secured
by
means
of
straps
passed
across
the
forehead
having
deposited
their
loads
upon
the
chitoka
they
turned
out
their
goods
and
then
seated
themselves
inside
the
empty
baskets
as
the
result
of
the
extreme
fertility
of
the
country
all
the
articles
offered
for
sale
were
of
a
quality
there
were
large
stores
of
rice
which
had
been
grown
at
a
profit
a
hundred
times
as
great
as
the
cost
and
maize
which
producing
three
crops
in
eight
months
yielded
a
profit
as
large
again
as
the
rice
there
were
also
sesame
urua
pepper
stronger
than
cayenne
manioc
nutmegs
salt
and
in
the
market
too
were
hundreds
of
goats
pigs
and
sheep
evidently
of
a
tartar
breed
with
hair
instead
of
wool
and
there
was
a
good
supply
of
fish
and
poultry
besides
all
these
there
was
an
attractive
display
of
pottery
the
designs
of
which
were
very
symmetrical
in
shrill
squeaky
voices
children
were
crying
several
varieties
of
native
drinks
which
whatever
it
was
seemed
to
be
in
great
demand
a
kind
of
beer
compounded
of
bananas
and
mead
a
mixture
of
honey
and
water
fermented
with
malt
but
the
most
prominent
feature
in
the
whole
market
was
the
traffic
in
stuffs
and
ivory
the
pieces
could
be
counted
by
thousands
of
the
unbleached
from
salem
in
massachusetts
of
the
blue
cotton
inches
wide
and
of
the
checked
blue
and
black
with
its
scarlet
border
more
expensive
than
these
were
lots
of
silk
with
red
green
or
yellow
grounds
which
are
sold
in
lengths
of
three
yards
at
prices
varying
from
seven
dollars
to
eighty
when
they
are
interwoven
with
gold
the
ivory
had
come
from
every
part
of
central
africa
and
was
destined
for
khartoom
zanzibar
and
natal
many
of
the
merchants
dealing
in
this
commodity
exclusively
how
vast
a
number
of
elephants
must
be
slaughtered
to
supply
this
ivory
may
be
imagined
when
it
is
remembered
that
over
tons
that
is
are
exported
annually
to
europe
of
this
much
the
larger
share
goes
to
england
where
the
sheffield
cutlery
consumes
about
lbs
from
the
west
coast
of
africa
alone
the
produce
is
nearly
tons
the
average
weight
of
a
pair
of
tusks
is
and
the
ordinary
value
of
these
in
would
be
about
but
here
in
kazonndé
were
some
weighing
no
less
than
of
that
soft
translucent
quality
which
retains
its
whiteness
far
better
than
the
ivory
from
other
sources
as
already
mentioned
slaves
are
not
unfrequently
used
as
current
money
amongst
the
african
traders
but
the
natives
themselves
usually
pay
for
their
goods
with
venetian
glass
beads
of
which
the
are
called
the
black
and
the
red
strung
in
ten
rows
or
these
beads
are
twisted
twice
round
the
neck
forming
what
is
called
a
which
is
always
reckoned
of
considerable
value
the
usual
measure
by
which
they
are
sold
is
the
containing
a
weight
of
about
lbs
livingstone
cameron
and
stanley
always
took
care
to
be
well
provided
with
this
kind
of
currency
in
default
of
beads
the
picé
a
zanzibar
coin
worth
something
more
than
a
farthing
and
shells
peculiar
to
the
east
coast
are
recognized
as
a
medium
of
exchange
in
the
market
amongst
the
cannibal
tribes
a
certain
value
is
attached
to
human
teeth
and
at
the
lakoni
some
natives
might
be
seen
wearing
strings
of
teeth
the
owners
of
which
they
had
probably
at
some
previous
time
devoured
this
species
of
currency
however
was
falling
rapidly
into
disuse
towards
the
middle
of
the
day
the
excitement
of
the
market
reached
its
highest
pitch
and
the
uproar
became
perfectly
deafening
the
voices
of
the
eager
sellers
mingled
with
those
of
indignant
and
overcharged
customers
fights
were
numerous
and
as
there
was
an
utter
absence
of
any
kind
of
police
no
effort
was
made
to
restore
peace
or
order
amongst
the
unruly
crowd
it
was
just
noon
when
alvez
gave
orders
that
the
slaves
he
wished
to
dispose
of
should
be
placed
on
view
thereupon
nearly
two
thousand
unfortunates
were
brought
forward
many
of
whom
had
been
confined
in
the
dealer
barracks
for
several
months
most
of
the
stock
however
had
been
so
carefully
attended
to
that
they
were
in
good
condition
and
it
was
only
the
last
batch
that
looked
as
if
they
would
be
improved
by
another
month
rest
but
as
the
demand
upon
the
east
coast
was
now
very
large
alvez
hoped
to
get
a
good
price
for
all
and
determined
to
part
with
even
the
last
arrivals
for
whatever
sum
he
could
obtain
amongst
these
latter
whom
the
havildars
drove
like
a
herd
of
cattle
into
the
middle
of
the
chitoka
were
tom
and
his
three
friends
they
were
closely
chained
and
rage
and
shame
were
depicted
in
their
countenances
bat
passed
a
quick
and
scrutinizing
gaze
around
him
and
said
to
the
others
i
do
not
see
mr
dick
tom
answered
mournfully
dick
will
be
killed
if
he
is
not
dead
already
our
only
hope
is
that
we
may
now
all
be
bought
in
one
lot
it
will
be
a
consolation
to
us
if
we
can
be
all
together
tears
rose
to
bat
eyes
as
he
thought
of
how
his
poor
old
father
was
likely
to
be
sold
and
carried
away
to
wear
out
his
days
as
a
common
slave
the
sale
now
commenced
the
agents
of
alvez
proceeded
to
divide
the
slaves
men
women
and
children
into
lots
treating
them
in
no
respect
better
than
beasts
in
a
tom
and
the
others
were
paraded
about
from
customer
to
customer
an
agent
accompanying
them
to
proclaim
the
price
demanded
strong
americans
quite
different
to
the
miserable
creatures
brought
from
the
banks
of
the
zambesi
and
lualaba
they
at
once
attracted
the
observation
of
the
arab
and
dealers
just
as
though
they
were
examining
a
horse
the
buyers
felt
their
limbs
turned
them
round
and
round
looked
at
their
teeth
and
finally
tested
their
paces
by
throwing
a
stick
to
a
distance
and
making
them
run
to
fetch
it
all
the
slaves
were
subjected
to
similar
humiliations
and
ail
alike
except
the
very
young
children
seemed
deeply
sensible
of
their
degradation
the
cruelty
exhibited
towards
them
was
very
vile
coïmbra
who
was
half
drunk
treated
them
with
the
utmost
brutality
not
that
they
had
any
reason
to
expect
any
gentler
dealings
at
the
hands
of
the
new
masters
who
might
purchase
them
for
ivory
or
any
other
commodity
children
were
torn
away
from
their
parents
husbands
from
their
wives
brothers
from
sisters
and
without
even
the
indulgence
of
a
parting
word
were
separated
never
to
meet
again
the
scenes
that
occur
at
such
markets
as
this
at
kazonndé
are
too
heartrending
to
be
described
in
detail
it
is
one
of
the
peculiar
requirements
of
the
that
the
two
sexes
should
have
an
entirely
different
destination
in
fact
the
dealers
who
purchase
men
never
purchase
women
the
women
who
are
required
to
supply
the
mussulman
harems
are
sent
principally
to
arab
districts
to
be
exchanged
for
ivory
whilst
the
men
who
are
to
be
put
to
hard
labour
are
despatched
to
the
coast
east
and
west
whence
they
are
exported
to
the
spanish
colonies
or
to
the
markets
of
muscat
or
madagascar
to
tom
and
his
friends
the
prospect
of
being
transported
to
a
slave
colony
was
far
better
than
that
of
being
retained
in
some
central
african
province
where
they
could
have
no
chance
of
regaining
their
liberty
and
the
moment
to
them
was
accordingly
one
of
great
suspense
altogether
things
turned
out
for
them
better
than
they
dared
anticipate
they
had
at
least
the
satisfaction
of
finding
that
as
yet
they
were
not
to
be
separated
alvez
of
course
had
taken
good
care
to
conceal
the
origin
of
this
exceptional
lot
and
their
own
ignorance
of
the
language
thoroughly
prevented
them
from
communicating
it
but
the
anxiety
to
secure
so
valuable
a
property
rendered
the
competition
for
it
very
keen
the
bidding
rose
higher
and
higher
until
at
length
the
four
men
were
knocked
down
to
a
rich
arab
dealer
who
purposed
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
to
take
them
to
lake
tanganyika
and
thence
to
one
of
the
deptôs
of
zanzibar
this
journey
it
is
true
would
be
for
miles
across
the
most
unhealthy
parts
of
central
africa
through
districts
harassed
by
internal
wars
and
it
seemed
improbable
that
tom
could
survive
the
hardships
he
must
meet
like
poor
old
nan
he
would
succumb
to
fatigue
but
the
brave
fellows
did
not
suffer
themselves
to
fear
the
future
they
were
only
too
happy
to
be
still
together
and
the
chain
that
bound
them
one
to
another
was
felt
to
be
easier
and
lighter
to
bear
their
new
master
knew
that
it
was
for
his
own
interest
that
his
purchase
should
be
well
taken
care
of
he
looked
to
make
a
substantial
profit
at
zanzibar
and
sent
them
off
at
once
to
his
own
private
barracks
consequently
they
saw
no
more
of
what
transpired
at
kazonndé

a
bowl
of
punch
the
afternoon
was
passing
away
and
it
was
now
past
four
when
the
sound
of
drums
cymbals
and
a
variety
of
native
instruments
was
heard
at
the
end
of
the
main
thoroughfare
the
market
was
still
going
on
with
the
same
animation
as
before
half
a
day
screeching
and
fighting
seemed
neither
to
have
wearied
the
voices
nor
broken
the
limbs
of
the
demoniacal
traffickers
there
was
a
considerable
number
of
slaves
still
to
be
disposed
of
and
the
dealers
were
haggling
over
the
remaining
lots
with
an
excitement
of
which
a
sudden
panic
on
the
london
stock
exchange
could
give
a
very
inadequate
conception
but
the
discordant
concert
which
suddenly
broke
upon
the
ear
was
the
signal
for
business
to
be
at
once
suspended
the
crowd
might
cease
its
uproar
and
recover
its
breath
the
king
of
kazonndé
moené
loonga
was
about
to
honour
the
with
a
visit
attended
by
a
large
retinue
of
wives
officers
soldiers
and
slaves
the
monarch
was
conveyed
to
the
middle
of
the
in
an
old
palanquin
from
which
he
was
obliged
to
have
five
or
six
people
to
help
him
to
descend
alvez
and
the
other
traders
advanced
to
meet
him
with
the
most
exaggerated
gestures
of
reverence
all
of
which
he
received
as
his
rightful
homage
he
was
a
man
of
fifty
years
of
age
but
might
easily
have
passed
for
eighty
he
looked
like
an
old
decrepit
monkey
on
his
head
was
a
kind
of
tiara
adorned
with
leopards
claws
dyed
red
and
tufts
of
hair
this
was
the
usual
crown
of
the
sovereigns
of
kazonndé
from
his
waist
hung
two
skirts
of
stiff
as
blacksmiths
aprons
and
embroidered
with
pearls
the
tattooings
on
his
breast
were
so
numerous
that
his
pedigree
which
they
declared
might
seem
to
reach
back
to
time
immemorial
his
wrists
and
arms
were
encased
in
copper
bracelets
thickly
encrusted
with
beads
he
wore
a
pair
of
a
present
from
alvez
some
twenty
years
ago
in
his
left
hand
he
carried
a
great
stick
surmounted
by
a
silver
knob
in
his
right
a
with
a
handle
studded
with
pearls
over
his
head
was
carried
an
old
umbrella
with
as
many
patches
as
a
harlequin
coat
whilst
from
his
neck
hung
cousin
benedict

on
his
nose
were
the
spectacles

been
stolen
from

the
potentate
beneath

round
such
was
the
appearance
of
the
potentate
beneath
whose
sway
the
country
trembled
for
a
hundred
miles
round
by
virtue
of
his
sovereignty
moené
loonga
claimed
to
be
of
celestial
origin
and
any
subject
who
should
have
the
audacity
to
raise
a
question
on
this
point
would
have
been
despatched
forthwith
to
another
world
all
his
actions
his
eating
and
drinking
were
supposed
to
be
performed
by
divine
impulse
he
certainly
drank
like
no
other
mortal
his
officers
and
ministers
confirmed
tipplers
as
they
were
appeared
sober
men
in
comparison
with
himself
and
he
seemed
never
to
be
doing
anything
but
imbibing
strong
pombé
and
spirit
with
which
alvez
kept
him
liberally
supplied
in
his
harem
moené
loonga
had
wives
of
all
ages
from
forty
to
fourteen
most
of
whom
accompanied
him
on
his
visit
to
the
moena
the
chief
wife
who
was
called
the
queen
was
the
eldest
of
them
all
and
like
the
rest
was
of
royal
blood
she
was
a
woman
very
gaily
attired
she
wore
a
kind
of
bright
tartan
over
a
skirt
of
woven
grass
embroidered
with
pearls
round
her
throat
was
a
profusion
of
necklaces
and
her
hair
was
mounted
up
in
tiers
that
toppled
high
above
her
head
making
her
resemble
some
hideous
monster
the
younger
wives
all
of
them
sisters
or
cousins
of
the
king
were
less
elaborately
dressed
they
walked
behind
her
ready
at
the
slightest
sign
to
perform
the
most
menial
services
did
his
majesty
wish
to
sit
down
two
of
them
would
immediately
stoop
to
the
ground
and
form
a
seat
with
their
bodies
whilst
others
would
have
to
lie
down
and
support
his
feet
upon
their
backs
a
throne
and
footstool
of
living
ebony
amidst
the
staggering
crowd
of
ministers
officers
and
magicians
that
composed
moené
loonga
suite
there
was
hardly
a
man
to
be
seen
who
had
not
lost
either
an
eye
an
ear
or
hand
or
nose
death
and
mutilation
were
the
only
two
punishments
practised
in
kazonndé
and
the
slightest
offence
involved
the
instant
amputation
of
some
member
of
the
body
the
loss
of
the
ear
was
considered
the
severest
penalty
as
it
prevented
the
possibility
of
wearing
earrings
the
governors
of
districts
or
whether
hereditary
or
appointed
for
four
years
were
distinguished
by
red
waistcoats
and
caps
in
their
hands
they
brandished
long
rattans
coated
at
one
extremity
with
a
varnish
of
magic
drugs
the
weapons
carried
by
the
soldiers
consisted
of
wooden
bows
adorned
with
fringes
and
provided
with
a
spare
bowstring
knives
filed
into
the
shape
of
serpents
tongues
long
broad
lances

no
demands
to
make
upon
the
royal
treasury
amongst
the
attendants
of
the
king
there
was
a
considerable
number
of
sorcerers
and
musicians
the
sorcerers
or
were
practically
the
physicians
of
the
court
the
savages
having
the
most
implicit
faith
in
divinations
and
incantations
of
every
kind
and
employing
fetishes
clay
or
wooden
figures
representing
sometimes
ordinary
human
beings
and
sometimes
fantastic
animals
like
the
rest
of
the
retinue
these
magicians
were
for
the
most
part
more
or
less
mutilated
an
indication
that
some
of
their
prescriptions
on
behalf
of
the
king
had
failed
of
success
the
musicians
were
of
both
sexes
some
performing
on
shrill
rattles
some
on
huge
drums
whilst
others
played
on
instruments
called
a
kind
of
dulcimer
made
of
two
rows
of
gourds
fastened
in
a
frame
and
struck
by
sticks
with
balls
at
the
end
to
any
but
native
ears
the
music
was
perfectly
deafening

alvez
advanced
and
presented
the
king
with
some
fresh
tobacco
several
flags
and
banners
were
carried
in
the
procession
and
amongst
these
was
mixed
up
a
number
of
long
pikes
upon
which
were
stuck
the
skulls
of
the
various
chiefs
that
moené
loonga
had
conquered
in
battle
as

king
as
helped
out
of
his
palanquin
the
acclamations
rose
higher
and
higher
from
every
quarter
of
the
market
place
the
soldiers
attached
to
the
caravans
fired
off
their
old
guns
though
the
reports
were
almost
too
feeble
to
be
heard
above
the
noisy
vociferations
of
the
crowd
and
the
havildars
rubbed
their
black
noses
with
cinnabar
powder

they
carried
in
bags
and
prostrated
themselves

advanced
and
presented
the
king
with
some
fresh
tobacco
the
appeasing
herb
as
it
is
called
in
the
native
dialect
and
certainly
moené
loonga
seemed
to
require
some
appeasing
as
for
some
unknown
reason
he
was
in
a
thoroughly
bad
temper

all
came
forward
to
pay
their
court
to

monarch
the
arabs
greeting
him
with

cry
of
or
welcome
others
clapped
their
hands
and
bowed
to
the
very
ground
while
some
even
smeared
themselves
with
mud
in
token
of
their
most
servile
subjection
but
moené
loonga
scarcely
took
notice
of
any
of
them
he
went
staggering
along
rolling
like
a
ship
upon
a
stormy
sea
and
made
his
way
past
the
crowds
of
slaves
each
of
whom
no
less
than
their
masters
trembled
lest
he
should
think
fit
to
claim
them
for
his
own
negoro
who
kept
close
at
alvez
side
did
not
fail
to
render
his
homage
along
with
the
rest
alvez
and
the
king
were
carrying
on
a
conversation
in
the
native
language
if
that
could
be
called
a
conversation
in
which
moené
loonga
merely
jerked
out
a
few
monosyllables
from
his
inflamed
and
swollen
lips
he
was
asking
alvez
to
replenish
his
stock
of
brandy
we
are
proud
to
welcome
your
majesty
at
the
market
of
kazonndé
alvez
was
saying
get
me
brandy

all
the
drunken

will
it
please
your
majesty
to
take
part
in
the
business
of
the
alvez
tried
to
ask

out
the

is
anxious
to

long
absence

again
will
the

obliged
to
take
notice

the

in

fury

send
him
to

cried
the
king
masongo
and
the
assuas
will
cut
him
up
and
eat
him
alive
only
too
true
it
is
that
cannibalism
is
still
openly
practised
in
certain
provinces
of
central
africa
livingstone
records
that
the
manyuemas
not
only
eat
men
killed
in
war
but
even
buy
slaves
for
that
purpose
it
is
said
to
be
the
avowal
of
these
manyuemas
that
human
flesh
is
slightly
salt
and
requires
no
seasoning
cameron
relates
how
in
the
dominions
of
moené

dead
bodies
were
soaked
for
a
few
days
in
running
water
as
a
preparation
for

being
devoured

stanley
found
traces
of

amongst

however
horrible
might
be
the
manner

proposed
by

to
let

out
of

clutches
the

here
he
said
to

it
is
here
he
has
committed
his
offence
and
here
he
should
be

if
you
will

must

yes
you
shall
have
the
assented
alvez
and
what
is
more
you
shall
have
it
all
alight
we
will
give
your
majesty
a
bowl
of
blazing
punch
the
thought
had
struck
alvez
and
he
was
himself
delighted
with
the
idea
that
he
would
set
the
spirit
in
flames
moené
loonga
had
complained
that
the
did
not
justify
its
name
as
it
ought
and
alvez
hoped
that
perhaps
administered
in
this
new
form
it
might
revivify
the
deadened
membranes
of
the
palate
of
the
king
moené
loonga
did
not
conceal
his
satisfaction
wives
and
courtiers
alike
were
full
of
anticipation
they
had
all
drunk
brandy
but
they
had
not
drunk
brandy
alight
and
not
only
was
their
thirst
for
alcohol
to
be
satisfied
their
thirst
for
blood
was
likewise
to
be
indulged
and
when
it
is
remembered
how
even
amongst
the
civilized
drunkenness
reduces
a
man
below
the
level
of
a
brute
it
may
be
imagined
to
what
barbarous
cruelties
dick
sands
was
likely
to
be
exposed
the
idea
of
torturing
a
white
man
was
not
altogether
repugnant
to
the
coloured
blood
of
either
alvez
or
coïmbra
while
with
negoro
the
spirit
of
vengeance
had
completely
overpowered
all
feeling
of
compunction
night
without
any
intervening
twilight
was
soon
drawing
on
and
the
contemplated
display
could
hardly
fail
to
be
effective
the
programme
for
the
evening
consisted
of
two
parts
first
the
blazing
then
the
torture
culminating
in
an
execution
the
destined
victim
was
still
closely
confined
in
his
dark
and
dreary
dungeon
all
the
slaves
whether
sold
or
not
had
been
driven
back
to
the
barracks
and
the
chitoka
was
cleared
of
every
one
except
the
the
havildars
and
the
soldiers
who
hoped
by
favour
of
the
king
to
have
a
share
of
the
flaming
punch
alvez
did
not
long
delay
the
proceedings
he
ordered
a
huge
caldron
capable
of
containing
more
than
twenty
gallons
to
be
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
into
this
were
emptied
several
casks
of
spirit
of
a
very
inferior
quality
to
which
was
added
a
supply
of
cinnamon
and
other
spices
no
ingredient
being
omitted
which
was
likely
to
give
a
pungency
to
suit
the
savage
palate
the
whole
royal
retinue
formed

circle
round
the
king
fascinated
by
the
sight
of
the
spirit
moené
loonga
came
reeling
up
to
the
edge
of
the
and
seemed
ready
to
plunge
himself
head
foremost
into
it

held
him
back
at
the
same
time
placing
a
lucifer
in
his
hand
set
it
alight
cried
the
grinning
slily
as
he
spoke
the
king
applied
the
match
to
the
surface
of
the
spirit
the
effect
was
instantaneous
high
above
the
edge
of
the
bowl
the
blue
flame
rose
and
curled
to
give
intensity
to
the
process
alvez
had
added
a
sprinkling
of
salt
to
the
mixture
and
this
caused
the
fire
to
cast
upon
the
faces
of
all
around
that
lurid
glare
which
is
generally
associated
with
apparitions
of
ghosts
and
phantoms
half
intoxicated
already
the
negroes
yelled
and
gesticulated
and
joining
hands
they
performed
a
fiendish
dance
around
their
monarch
alvez
stood
and
stirred
the
spirit
with
an
enormous
metal
ladle
attached
to
a
pole
and
as
the
flames
rose
yet
higher
and
higher
they
seemed
to
throw
a
more
and
more
unearthly
glamour
over
the
forms
that
circled
in
their
wild
career
moené
loonga
in
his
eagerness
soon
seized
the
ladle
from
the
hands
plunged
it
deep
into
the
bowl
and
bringing
it
up
again
full
of
the
blazing
punch
raised
it
to
his
lips
a
horrible
shriek
brought
the
dancers
to
a
sudden
standstill
by
a
kind
of
spontaneous
combustion
the
king
had
taken
fire
internally
though
it
was
a
fire
that
emitted
little
heat
it
was
none
the
less
intense
and
consuming
in
an
instant
one
of
the
ministers
in
attendance
ran
to
the
king
assistance
but
he
almost
as
much
alcoholized
as
his
master
caught
fire
as
well
and
soon
both
monarch
and
minister
lay
writhing
on
the
ground
in
unutterable
agony
not
a
soul
was
able
to
lend
a
helping
hand
alvez
and
negoro
were
at
a
loss
what
to
do
the
courtiers
dared
not
expose
themselves
to
so
terrible
a
fate
the
women
had
all
fled
in
alarm
and
coïmbra
awakened
to
the
conviction
of
the
inflammability
of
his
own
condition
had
rapidly
decamped
illustration
the
king
had
taken
fire
internally
to
say
the
truth
it
was
impossible
to
do
anything
water
would
have
proved
unavailing
to
quench
the
pale
blue
flame
that
hovered
over
the
prostrate
forms
every
tissue
of
which
was
so
thoroughly
impregnated
with
spirit
that
combustion
though
outwardly
extinguished
would
continue
its
work
internally
in
a
few
minutes
life
was
extinct
but
the
bodies
continued
long
afterwards
to
burn
until
upon
the
spot
where
they
had
fallen
a
few
light
ashes
some
fragments
of
the
spinal
column
some
fingers
and
some
toes
covered
with
a
thin

all
that
remained
of

and
his
ill
fated
minister
chapter
xii
royal
obsequies
on
the
following
morning
the
town
of
kazonndé
presented
an
aspect
of
unwonted
desolation
at
the
event
of
the
previous
evening
the
natives
had
all
shut
themselves
up
in
their
huts
that
a
monarch
who
was
to
be
assumed
as
of
divine
origin
should
perish
with
one
of
his
ministers
by
so
horrible
a
death
was
a
thing
wholly
unparalleled
in
their
experience
some
of
the
elder
part
of
the
community
remembered
having
taken
part
in
certain
cannibal
preparations
and
were
aware
that
the
cremation
of
a
human
body
is
no
easy
matter
yet
here
was
a
case
in
which
two
men
had
been
all
but
utterly
consumed
without
any
extraneous
application
here
was
a
mystery
that
baffled
all
their
comprehension
old
alvez
had
also
retired
to
the
seclusion
of
his
own
residence
having
been
warned
by
negoro
that
he
would
probably
be
held
responsible
for
the
occurrence
he
deemed
it
prudent
to
keep
in
retirement
meanwhile
negoro
industriously
circulated
the
report
that
the
death
had
been
brought
about
by
supernatural
means
reserved
by
the
great
manitoo
solely
for
his
elect
and
that
it
was
sacred
fire
that
had
proceeded
from
his
body
the
superstitious
natives
readily
received
this
version
of
the
affair
and
at
once
proceeded
to
honour
moené
loonga
with
funeral
rites
worthy
of
one
thus
conspicuously
elevated
to
the
rank
of
the
gods
the
ceremony
which
entailed
an
expenditure
of
human
blood
incredible
except
that
it
is
authenticated
by
cameron
and
other
african
travellers
was
just
the
opportunity
that
negoro
required
for
carrying
out
his
designs
against
dick
whom
he
intended
to
take
a
prominent
part
in
it
the
natural
successor
to
the
king
was
the
queen
moena
by
inaugurating
the
funeral
without
delay
and
thus
assuming
the
semblance
of
authority
she
forestalled
the
king
of
ukusu
or
any
other
rival
who
might
venture
to
dispute
her
sovereignty
and
moreover
by
taking
the
reins
of
government
into
her
hands
she
avoided
the
fate
reserved
for
the
other
wives
who
had
they
been
allowed
to
live
might
prove
somewhat
troublesome
to
the
shrew
accordingly
with
the
sound
of
coodoo
horns
and
marimbas
she
caused
a
proclamation
to
be
made
in
the
various
quarters
of
the
town
that
the
obsequies
of
the
deceased
monarch
would
be
celebrated
on
the
next
evening
with
all
due
solemnity
the
announcement
met
with
no
opposition
either
from
the
officials
about
the
court
or
from
the
public
at
large
alvez
and
the
traders
generally
were
quite
satisfied
with
moena
assumption
of
the
supremacy
knowing
that
by
a
few
presents
and
a
little
flattery
they
could
make
her
sufficiently
considerate
for
their
own
interests
preparations
began
at
once
at
the
end
of
the
chief
thoroughfare
flowed
a
deep
and
rapid
brook
an
affluent
of
the
coango
in
the
dry
bed
of
which
the
royal
grave
was
to
be
formed
natives
were
immediately
set
to
work
to
construct
a
dam
by
means
of
which
the
water
should
be
diverted
until
the
burial
was
over
into
a
temporary
channel
across
the
plain
the
last
act
in
the
ceremonial
being
to
undam
the
stream
and
allow
it
to
resume
its
proper
course
negoro
had
formed
the
resolution
that
dick
sands
should
be
one
of
the
victims
to
be
sacrificed
upon
the
king
tomb
thoroughly
aware
as
he
was
that
the
indignation
which
had
caused
the
death
of
harris
extended
in
at
least
an
equal
degree
to
himself
the
cowardly
rascal
would
not
have
ventured
to
approach
dick
under
similar
circumstances
at
the
risk
of
meeting
a
similar
fate
but
knowing
him
to
be
a
prisoner
bound
hand
and
foot
from
whom
there
could
be
nothing
to
fear
he
resolved
to
go
to
him
in
his
not
only
did
he
delight
in
torturing
his
victims
but
he
derived
an
especial
gratification
from
witnessing
the
torture
about
the
middle
of
the
day
accordingly
he
made
his
way
to
the
cell
where
dick
was
detained
under
the
strict
watch
of
a
havildar
there
bound
with
fetters
that
penetrated
his
very
flesh
lay
the
poor
boy
for
the
last
four
and
twenty
hours
he
had
not
been
allowed
a
morsel
of
food
and
would
gladly
have
faced
the
most
painful
death
as
a
welcome
relief
to
his
miseries
but
at
the
sight
of
negoro
all
his
energy
revived
instinctively
he
made
an
effort
to
burst
his
bonds
and
to
get
a
hold
upon
his
persecutor
but
the
strength
of
a
giant
would
have
been
utterly
unavailing
for
such
a
design
dick
felt
that
the
struggle
he
had
to
make
was
of
another
kind
and
forcing
himself
to
an
apparent
composure
he
determined
to
look
negoro
straight
in
the
face
but
to
vouchsafe
no
reply
to
anything
he
might
say
i
felt
bound
negoro
began
to
come
and
pay
my
respects
to
my
young
captain
and
to
tell
him
how
sorry
i
am
that
he
has
not
the
same
authority
here
that
he
had
on
board
the
finding
that
dick
returned
no
answer
he
continued
you
remember
your
old
cook
captain
i
have
come
to
know
what
you
would
like
to
order
for
your
breakfast
here
he
paused
to
give
a
brutal
kick
at
dick
foot
and
went
on
i
have
also
another
question
to
ask
you
captain
can
you
tell
me
how
it
was
that
you
landed
here
in
angola
instead
of
upon
the
coast
of
america
the
way
in
which
the
question
was
put
more
than
ever
confirmed
impression
that
the
pilgrim
course
had
been
altered
by
negoro
but
he
persevered
in
maintaining
a
contemptuous
silence
it
was
a
lucky
thing
for
you
captain
resumed
the
vindictive
portuguese
that
you
had
a
good
seaman
on
board
otherwise
the
ship
would
have
run
aground
on
some
reef
in
the
tempest
instead
of
coming
ashore
here
in
a
friendly
port
illustration
your
life
is
in
my
hands
whilst
he
was
speaking
negoro
had
gradually
drawn
nearer
to
the
prisoner
until
their
faces
were
almost
in
contact
exasperated
by
dick
calmness
his
countenance
assumed
an
expression
of
the
utmost
ferocity
and
at
last
he
burst
forth
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
it
is
my
turn
now
i
am
master
now
i
am
captain
here
you
are
in
my
power
now
your
life
is
in
my
hands
take
it
then
said
dick
quietly
death
has
no
terrors
for
me
and
your
wickedness
will
soon
be
avenged
avenged
roared
negoro
do
you
suppose
there
is
a
single
soul
to
care
about
you
avenged
who
will
concern
himself
with
what
befalls
you
except
alvez
and
me
there
is
no
one
with
a
shadow
of
authority
here
if
you
think
you
are
going
to
get
any
help
from
old
tom
or
any
of
those
niggers
let
me
tell
you
that
they
are
every
one
of
them
sold
and
have
been
sent
off
to
zanzibar
hercules
is
free
said
dick
hercules
sneered
negoro
he
has
been
food
for
lions
and
panthers
long
ago
i
am
only
sorry
that
i
did
not
get
the
chance
of
disposing
of
him
myself
and
there
is
dingo
calmly
persisted
dick
sure
as
fate
he
will
find
you
out
some
day
dingo
is
dead
retorted
negoro
with
malicious
glee
i
shot
the
brute
myself
and
i
should
be
glad
if
every
survivor
of
the
had
shared
his
fate
but
remember
said
dick
you
have
to
follow
them
all
yourself
and
he
fixed
a
sharp
gaze
upon
his
persecutor
eye
the
portuguese
villain
was
stung
to
the
quick
he
made
a
dash
towards
the
youth
and
would
have
strangled
him
upon
the
spot
but
remembering
that
any
such
sudden
action
would
be
to
liberate
him
from
the
torture
he
was
determined
he
should
undergo
he
controlled
his
rage
and
after
giving
strict
orders
to
the
havildar
who
had
been
a
passive
spectator
of
the
scene
to
keep
a
careful
watch
upon
his
charge
he
left
the
dungeon
so
far
from
depressing
dick
spirits
the
interview
had
altogether
a
contrary
effect
his
feelings
had
undergone
a
reaction
so
that
all
his
energies
were
restored
possibly
negoro
in
his
sudden
assault
had
unintentionally
loosened
his
fetters
for
he
certainly
seemed
to
have
greater
play
for
his
limbs
and
fancied
that
by
a
slight
effort
he
might
succeed
in
disengaging
his
arms
even
that
amount
of
freedom
however
he
knew
could
be
of
no
real
avail
to
him
he
was
a
prisoner
without
hope
of
succour
from
without
and
now
he
had
no
other
wish
than
cheerfully
to
meet
the
death
that
should
unite
him
to
the
friends
who
had
gone
before
the
hours
passed
on
the
gleams
of
daylight
that
penetrated
the
thatched
roof
of
the
prison
gradually
faded
into
darkness
the
few
sounds
on
the
chitoka
a
great
contrast
to
the
hubbub
of
the
day
became
hushed
into
silence
and
night
fell
upon
the
town
of
kazonndé
dick
sands
slept
soundly
for
about
a
couple
of
hours
and
woke
up
considerably
refreshed
one
of
his
arms
which
was
somewhat
less
swollen
than
the
other
he
was
able
to
withdraw
from
its
bonds
it
was
at
any
rate
a
relief
to
stretch
it
at
his
pleasure
the
havildar
grasping
the
neck
of
a
which
he
had
just
drained
had
sunk
into
a
heavy
slumber
and
dick
sands
was
contemplating
the
possibility
of
getting
posssession
of
his
weapons
when
his
attention
was
arrested
by
a
scratching
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
by
the
help
of
his
liberated
arm
he
contrived
to
crawl
noiselessly
to
the
threshold
where
the
scratching
increased
in
violence
for
a
moment
he
was
in
doubt
whether
the
noise
proceeded
from
the
movements
of
a
man
or
an
animal
he
gave
a
glance
at
the
havildar
who
was
sound
asleep
and
placing
his
lips
against
the
door
murmured
hercules
a
low
whining
was
the
sole
reply
it
must
be
dingo
muttered
dick
to
himself
negoro
may
have
told
me
a
lie
perhaps
after
all
the
dog
is
not
dead
as
though
in
answer
to
his
thoughts
a
dog
paw
was
pushed
below
the
door
dick
seized
it
eagerly
he
had
no
doubt
it
was
dingo
but
if
the
dog
brought
a
message
it
was
sure
to
be
tied
to
his
neck
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
means
of
getting
at
it
except
the
hole
underneath
could
be
made
large
enough
to
admit
the
animal
head
dick
determined
to
try
and
scrape
away
the
soil
at
the
threshold
and
commenced
digging
with
his
nails
but
he
had
scarcely
set
himself
to
his
task
when
loud
barkings
other
than
dingo
were
heard
in
the
distance
the
faithful
creature
had
been
scented
out
by
the
native
dogs
and
instinct
dictated
an
immediate
flight
alarm
had
evidently
been
taken
as
several
were
fired
the
havildar
half
roused
himself
from
his
slumber
and
dick
was
fain
to
roll
himself
once
more
into
his
corner
there
to
await
the
dawn
of
the
day
which
was
intended
to
be
his
last
illustration
all
his
energies
were
restored
throughout
that
day
the
was
carried
on
with
unremitted
activity
a
large
number
of
the
natives
under
the
superintendence
of
the
queen
prime
minister
were
set
to
work
and
according
to
the
decree
of
moena
who
seemed
resolved
to
continue
the
rigorous
sway
of
her
departed
husband
were
bound
under
penalty
of
mutilation
to
accomplish
their
task
within
the
proscribed
time
as
soon
as
the
stream
had
been
diverted
into
its
temporary
channel
there
was
hollowed
out
in
the
dry
river
bed
a
pit
fifty
feet
long
ten
feet
wide
and
ten
feet
deep
this
towards
the
close
of
the
day
was
lined
throughout
with
living
women
selected
from
moené
slaves
in
ordinary
cases
it
would
have
been
their
fate
to
be
buried
alive
beside
their
master
but
in
recognition
of
his
miraculous
death
it
was
ordained
that
they
should
be
drowned
beside
his
remains

it
was
not

to

the

reached

shed
a
ruddy
glare
upon
the
teeming
crowd
the
grave
with
its
lining
of
living
women
bound
to
its
side
by
chains
was
plainly
visible
fifty
slaves
some
resigned
and
mute
others
uttering
loud
and
piteous
cries
were
there
awaiting
the
moment
when
the
rushing
torrent
should
be
opened
upon

the
wives
who
were
destined
to
perish
had
been
selected
by
the
queen
herself
and
were
all
in
one
of
the
victims
who
bore

forced
down
upon

in

down
at

of

at
the
end
of
the

a
huge
stake
painted

was
planted
firmly
in

to

of

all
at
a
sign
from
the
queen
the
fourth
wife
forming
the
royal
footstool
had
her
throat
cut
by
an
executioner
her
blood
streaming
into
the
grave
this
barbarous
deed
was
the
commencement
of
a
most
frightful
butchery
one
after
another
fifty
slaves
fell
beneath
the
slaughterous
knife
until
the
was
a
very
cataract
of
blood
for
half
an
hour
the
shrieks
of
the
victims
mingled
with
the
imprecations
of
their
murderers
without
evoking
one
single
expression
of
horror
or
sympathy
from
the
gazing
crowd
around
at
a
second
signal
from

queen
the
barrier
which
retained

water
above
was
opened
by
a
refinement
of
cruelty
the
torrent
was
not
admitted
suddenly
to
the
grave
but
allowed
to
trickle
gradually
in

be
drowned

the
slaves
that
carpeted
the
bottom
of
the
trench
their
frightful
struggles
bearing
witness
to
the
slow
death
that
was
overpowering
them
dick
was
immersed
to
his
knees
but
he
could
be
seen
making
what
might
seem
one
last
frantic
effort
to
burst
his
bonds
steadily
rose
the
water
the
stream
resumed
its
proper
course
the
last
head
disappeared
beneath
its
surface
and
soon
there
remained
nothing
to
indicate
that
in
the
depth
below
there
was
a
tomb
where
a
hundred
victims
had
been
sacrificed
to
the
memory
of
the
king
of
kazonndé
painful
as
they
are
to
describe
it
is
impossible
to
ignore
the
reality
of
such
scenes
chapter
xiii
in
captivity
so
far
from
weldon
and
jack
having
succumbed
to
the
hardships
to
which
they
had
been
exposed
they
were
both
alive
and
together
with
cousin
benedict
were
now
in
kazonndé
after
the
assault
upon
the
they
had
all
three
been
conveyed
beyond
the
encampment
to
a
spot
where
a
rude
palanquin
was
in
readiness
for
weldon
and
her
son
the
journey
hence
to
kazonndé
was
consequently
accomplished
without
much
difficulty
cousin
benedict
who
performed
it
on
foot
was
allowed
to
entomologize
as
much
as
he
pleased
upon
the
road
so
that
to
him
the
distance
was
a
matter
of
no
concern
the
party
reached
their
destination
a
week
sooner
than
ibn
hamish
caravan
and
the
prisoners
were
lodged
in
alvez
quarters
jack
was
much
better
after
leaving
the
marshy
districts
he
had
no
return
of
fever
and
as
a
certain
amount
of
indulgence
had
been
allowed
them
on
their
journey
both
he
and
his
mother
as
far
as
their
health
was
concerned
might
be
said
to
be
in
a
satisfactory
condition
of
the
rest
of
her
former
companions
weldon
could
hear
nothing
she
had
herself
been
a
witness
of
the
escape
of
hercules
but
of
course
knew
nothing
further
of
his
fate
as
for
dick
sands
she
entertained
a
sanguine
hope
that
his
white
skin
would
protect
him
from
any
severe
treatment
but
for
nan
and
the
other
poor
negroes
here
upon
african
soil
she
feared
the
very
worst
being
entirely
shut
off
from
communication
with
the
outer
world
she
was
quite
unaware
of
the
arrival
of
the
caravan
even
if
she
had
heard
the
noisy
commotion
of
the
market
she
would
not
have
known
what
it
meant
and
she
was
in
ignorance
alike
of
the
death
of
harris
of
the
sale
of
tom
and
his
companions
of
the
dreadful
end
of
the
king
and
of
the
royal
obsequies
in
which
poor
dick
had
been
assigned
so
melancholy
a
share
during
the
journey
from
the
coanza
to
kazonndé
harris
and
negoro
had
held
no
conversation
with
her
and
since
her
arrival
she
had
not
been
allowed
to
pass
the
inclosure
of
the
establishment
so
that
as
far
as
she
knew
she
was
quite
alone
and
being
in
negoro
power
was
in
a
position
from
which
it
seemed
only
too
likely
nothing
but
death
could
release
her
from
cousin
benedict
it
is
needless
to
repeat
she
could
expect
no
assistance
his
own
personal
pursuits
engrossed
him
and
he
had
no
care
nor
leisure
to
bestow
upon
external
circumstances
his
first
feeling
on
being
made
to
understand
that
he
was
not
in
america
was
one
of
deep
disappointment
that
the
wonderful
things
he
had
seen
were
no
discoveries
at
all
they
were
simply
african
insects
common
on
african
soil
this
vexation
however
soon
passed
away
and
he
began
to
believe
that
the
land
of
the
pharaohs
might
possess
as
much
entomological
wealth
as
the
land
of
the
incas
ah
he
would
exclaim
to
weldon
heedless
that
she
gave
him
little
or
no
attention
this
is
the
country
of
the
manticoræ
and
wonderful
coleoptera
they
are
with
their
long
hairy
legs
their
sharp
elytra
and
their
big
mandibles
the
most
remarkable
of
them
all
is
the
tuberous
manticora
and
is
this
too
the
land
of
the
calosomi
and
of
the
goliaths
of
guinea
and
gabon
here
too
we
ought
to
find
the
spotted
anthidia
which
lay
their
eggs
in
empty
and
the
sacred
atenchus
which
the
old
egyptians
used
to
venerate
as
divine
yes
yes
he
would
say
at
another
time
this
is
the
proper
habitat
of
those
sphinxes
which
are
now
so
common
everywhere
and
this
is
the
place
for
those
bigoti
so
formidable
to
the
natives
of
senegal
there
must
be
wonderful
discoveries
to
be
made
here
if
only
those
good
people
will
let
me
the
good
people
referred
to
were
negoro
and
harris
who
had
restored
him
much
of
the
liberty
of
which
dick
sands
had
found
it
necessary
to
deprive
him
with
freedom
to
roam
and
in
possession
of
his
tin
box
benedict
would
have
been
amongst
the
most
contented
of
men
had
it
not
been
for
the
loss
of
his
spectacles
and
now
buried
with
the
king
of
kazonndé
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
poking
every
insect
almost
into
his
eyes
before
he
could
discover
its
characteristics
he
would
have
sacrificed
much
to
recover
or
replace
his
glasses
but
as
such
articles
were
not
to
be
procured
at
any
price
he
contented
himself
with
the
permission
to
go
where
he
pleased
within
the
limits
of
the
palisade
his
keepers
knew
him
well
enough
to
be
satisfied
that
he
would
make
no
attempt
to
escape
and
as
the
enclosure
was
nearly
a
mile
in
circumference
containing
many
shrubs
and
trees
and
huts
with
thatched
roofs
besides
being
intersected
by
a
running
stream
it
afforded
him
a
very
fair
scope
for
his
researches
and
who
should
say
that
he
would
not
discover
some
novel
specimen
to
which
in
the
records
of
entomological
science
his
own
name
might
be
assigned
if
thus
the
domain
of
antonio
alvez
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
benedict
to
little
jack
it
might
well
seem
immense
but
though
allowed
to
ramble
over
the
whole
place
as
he
liked
the
child
rarely
cared
to
leave
his
mother
he
would
be
continually
inquiring
about
his
father
whom
he
had
now
so
long
been
expecting
to
see
he
would
ask
why
nan
and
hercules
and
dingo
had
gone
away
and
left
him
and
perpetually
he
would
be
expressing
his
wonder
where
dick
could
be
and
wishing
he
would
come
back
again
weldon
could
only
hide
her
tears
and
answer
him
by
caresses
nothing
however
transpired
to
give
the
least
intimation
that
any
of
the
prisoners
were
to
be
treated
otherwise
than
they
had
been
upon
the
journey
from
the
coanza
excepting
such
as
were
retained
for
old
personal
service
all
the
slaves
had
been
sold
and
the
storehouses
were
now
full
of
stuffs
and
ivory
the
stuffs
destined
to
be
sent
into
the
central
provinces
and
the
ivory
to
be
exported
the
establishment
was
thus
no
longer
crowded
as
it
had
been
and
weldon
and
jack
were
lodged
in
a
different
hut
to
cousin
benedict
all
three
however
took
their
meals
together
and
were
allowed
a
sufficient
diet
of
mutton
or
vegetables
manioc
sorghum
and
native
fruits
with
the
traders
servants
they
held
no
communication
but
halima
a
young
slave
who
had
been
told
off
to
attend
to
weldon
evinced
for
her
new
mistress
an
attachment
which
though
rough
was
evidently
sincere
illustration
he
contented
himself
with
the
permission
to
go
where
he
pleased
within
the
limits
of
the
palisade
old
alvez
who
occupied
the
principal
house
in
thedépôt
was
rarely
seen
whilst
the
of
either
harris
or
negoro
caused
weldon
much
surprise
and
perplexity
in
the
midst
of
all
her
troubles
too
she
was
haunted
by
the
thought
of
the
anxiety
her
husband
must
be
suffering
on
her
account
unaware
of
her
having
embarked
on
board
the
pilgrim
at
first
he
would
have
wondered
at
steamer
after
steamer
arriving
at
san
francisco
without
her
after
a
while
the
pilgrim
would
have
been
registered
amongst
the
number
of
missing
ships
and
it
was
certain
the
intelligence
would
be
forwarded
to
him
by
his
correspondents
that
the
vessel
had
sailed
from
auckland
with
his
wife
and
child
on
board
what
was
he
to
imagine
he
might
refuse
to
believe
that
they
had
perished
at
sea
but
he
would
never
dream
of
their
having
been
carried
to
africa
and
would
certainly
institute
a
search
in
no
other
direction
than
on
the
coast
of
america
or
amongst
the
isles
of
the
pacific
she
had
not
the
faintest
hope
of
her
whereabouts
being
discovered
and
involuntarily
her
thoughts
turned
to
the
possibility
of
making
an
escape
she
might
well
feel
her
heart
sink
within
her
at
the
bare
idea
even
if
she
should
succeed
in
eluding
the
vigilance
of
the
watch
there
were
two
hundred
miles
of
dense
forest
to
be
traversed
before
the
coast
could
be
reached
nevertheless
it
revealed
itself
to
her
as
her
last
chance
and
failing
all
else
she
resolved
to
hazard
it
but
first
of
all
she
determined
if
it
were
possible
to
discover
the
ultimate
design
of
negoro
she
was
not
kept
long
in
suspense
on
the
of
june
just
a
week
after
the
royal
funeral
the
portuguese
entered
the
depót
in
which
he
had
not
set
foot
since
his
return
and
made
his
way
straight
to
the
hut
in
which
he
knew
he
should
find
the
prisoner
benedict
was
out
jack
under
halima
charge
was
being
taken
for
a
walk
weldon
was
alone
negoro
pushed
open
the
door
and
said
abruptly
weldon
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
tom
and
his
lot
have
been
sold
for
the
ujiji
market
nan
died
on
her
way
here
and
dick
sands
is
dead
too
weldon
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
yes
weldon
he
continued
he
has
got
what
he
deserved
he
shot
harris
and
has
been
executed
for
the
murder
and
here
you
are
alone
mark
this
alone
and
in
my
power
what
negoro
said
was
true
tom
bat
actæon
and
austin
had
all
been
sent
off
that
morning
on
their
way
to
ujiji
weldon
groaned
bitterly
negoro
went
on
if
i
chose
i
could
still
further
avenge
upon
you
the
i
got
on
board
that
ship
but
it
does
not
suit
my
purpose
to
kill
you
you
and
that
boy
of
yours
and
that
idiot
of
a
all
have
a
certain
value
in
the
market
i
mean
to
sell
you
you
dare
not
said
weldon
firmly
you
know
you
are
making
an
idle
threat
who
do
you
suppose
would
purchase
people
of
white
blood
i
know
a
customer
who
will
give
me
the
price
i
mean
to
ask
replied
negoro
with
a
brutal
grin
she
bent
down
her
head
only
too
well
she
knew
that
such
things
were
possible
in
this
horrid
land
tell
me
who
he
is
she
said
tell
the
name
of
the
man
who
james
weldon
he
answered
slowly
my
husband
she
cried
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
what
i
say
i
mean
to
make
your
husband
buy
you
back
at
my
price
and
if
he
likes
to
pay
for
them
he
shall
have
his
son
and
his
cousin
too
illustration
i
suppose
weldon
will
not
mind
coming
to
fetch
you
and
when
and
how
may
i
ask
do
you
propose
to
manage
this
replied
weldon
forcing
herself
to
be
calm
here
and
soon
too
i
suppose
weldon
will
not
mind
coming
to
fetch
you
he
would
not
hesitate
to
come
but
how
could
he
know
we
are
here
i
will
go
to
him
i
have
money
that
will
take
me
to
san
francisco
what
you
stole
from
the
said
weldon
just
so
replied
negoro
and
i
have
plenty
more
i
suppose
when
weldon
hears
that
you
are
a
prisoner
in
central
africa
he
will
not
think
much
of
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
but
how
is
he
to
know
the
truth
of
your
statement
i
shall
take
him
a
letter
from
you
you
shall
represent
me
as
your
faithful
servant
just
escaped
from
the
hands
of
savages
a
letter
such
as
that
i
will
never
write
never
said
weldon
decisively
what
what
you
refuse
i
refuse
she
had
all
the
natural
cravings
of
a
woman
and
a
wife
but
so
thoroughly
was
she
aware
of
the
treachery
of
the
man
she
had
to
deal
with
that
she
dreaded
lest
as
soon
as
he
had
touched
the
ransom
he
would
dispose
of
her
husband
altogether
there
was
a
short
silence
you
will
write
that
letter
said
negoro
never
repeated
weldon
remember
your
child
weldon
heart
beat
violently
but
she
did
not
answer
a
word
i
will
give
you
a
week
to
think
over
this
hissed
out
negoro
weldon
was
still
silent
a
week
i
will
come
again
in
a
week
you
will
do
as
i
wish
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
he
gnashed
his
teeth
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
the
hut
chapter
xiv
a
ray
of
hope
weldon
first
feeling
on
being
left
alone
was
a
sense
of
relief
at
having
a
week
respite
she
had
no
trust
in
negoro
honesty
but
she
knew
well
enough
that
their
marketable
value
would
secure
them
from
any
personal
danger
and
she
had
time
to
consider
whether
some
compromise
might
be
effected
by
which
her
husband
might
be
spared
the
necessity
of
coming
to
kazonndé
upon
the
receipt
of
a
letter
from
herself
he
would
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
in
undertaking
the
journey
but
she
entertained
no
little
fear
that
after
all
perhaps
her
own
departure
might
not
be
permitted
the
slightest
caprice
on
the
part
of
queen
moena
would
detain
her
as
a
captive
whilst
as
to
negoro
if
once
he
should
get
the
ransom
he
wanted
he
would
take
no
further
pains
in
the
matter
accordingly
she
resolved
to
make
the
proposition
that
she
should
be
conveyed
to
some
point
upon
the
coast
where
the
bargain
could
be
concluded
without
weldon
coming
up
the
country
she
had
to
weigh
all
the
consequences
that
would
follow
any
refusal
on
her
part
to
fall
in
with
negoro
demands
of
course
he
would
spend
the
interval
in
preparing
for
his
start
to
america
and
when
he
should
come
back
and
find
her
still
hesitating
was
it
not
likely
that
he
would
find
scope
for
his
revenge
in
suggesting
that
she
must
be
separated
from
her
child
the
very
thought
sent
a
pang
through
her
heart
and
she
clasped
her
little
boy
tenderly
to
her
side
what
makes
you
so
sad
mamma
asked
jack
i
was
thinking
of
your
father
my
child
she
answered
would
you
not
like
to
see
him
yes
yes
is
he
coming
here
no
my
boy
he
must
not
come
here
then
let
us
take
dick
and
tom
and
hercules
and
go
to
him
weldon
tried
to
conceal
her
tears
have
you
heard
from
papa
no
then
why
do
you
not
write
to
him
write
to
him
repeated
his
mother
that
is
the
very
thing
i
was
thinking
about
the
child
little
knew
the
agitation
that
was
troubling
her
mind
meanwhile
weldon
had
another
inducement
which
she
hardly
ventured
to
own
to
herself
for
postponing
her
final
decision
was
it
absolutely
impossible
that
her
liberation
should
be
effected
by
some
different
means
altogether
a
few
days
previously
she
had
overheard
a
conversation
outside
her
hut
and
over
this
she
had
found
herself
continually
pondering
alvez
and
one
of
the
ujiji
dealers
discussing
the
future
prospects
of
their
business
mutually
agreed
in
denouncing
the
efforts
that
were
being
made
for
the
suppression
of
the
not
only
by
the
cruisers
on
the
coast
but
by
the
intrusion
of
travellers
and
missionaries
into
the
interior
alvez
averred
that
all
these
troublesome
visitors
ought
to
be
exterminated
forthwith
but
kill
one
and
another
crops
up
replied
the
dealer
yes
their
exaggerated
reports
bring
up
a
swarm
of
them
said
alvez
it
seemed
a
subject
of
bitter
complaint
that
the
markets
of
nyangwé
zanzibar
and
the
had
been
invaded
by
speke
and
grant
and
others
and
although
they
congratulated
each
other
that
the
western
provinces
had
not
yet
been
much
persecuted
they
confessed
that
now
that
the
travelling
epidemic
had
begun
to
rage
there
was
no
telling
how
soon
a
lot
of
european
and
american
might
be
among
them
thedépôts
at
cassange
and
bihe
had
both
been
visited
and
although
kazonndé
had
hitherto
been
left
quiet
there
were
rumours
enough
that
the
continent
was
to
be
tramped
over
from
east
to
west
footnote
this
extraordinary
feat
was
it
is
universally
known
subsequently
accomplished
by
cameron
and
it
may
be
continued
alvez
that
that
missionary
fellow
livingstone
is
already
on
his
way
to
us
if
he
comes
there
can
be
but
one
result
there
must
be
freedom
for
all
the
slaves
in
kazonndé
freedom
for
the
slaves
in
kazonndé
these
were
the
words
which
in
connexion
with
livingstone
name
had
arrested
attention
and
who
can
wonder
that
she
pondered
them
over
and
over
again
and
ventured
to
associate
them
with
her
own
prospects
here
was
a
ray
of
hope
the
mere
mention
of
livingstone
name
in
association
with
this
story
seems
to
demand
a
brief
survey
of
his
career
born
on
the
of
march
david
livingstone
was
the
second
of
six
children
of
a
tradesman
in
the
village
of
blantyre
in
lanarkshire
after
two
years
training
in
medicine
and
theology
he
was
sent
out
by
the
london
missionary
society
and
landed
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
in
with
the
intention
of
joining
moffat
in
south
africa
after
exploring
the
country
of
the
bechuanas
he
returned
to
kuruman
and
having
married
moffat
daughter
proceeded
in
to
found
a
mission
in
the
mabotsa
valley
after
four
years
he
removed
to
kolobeng
in
the
bechuana
district
miles
north
of
kuruman
whence
in
starting
off
with
his
wife
three
children
and
two
friends
oswell
and
murray
he
discovered
lake
ngami
and
returned
by
descending
the
course
of
the
zouga
the
opposition
of
the
natives
had
prevented
his
proceeding
beyond
lake
ngami
at
his
first
visit
and
he
made
a
second
with
no
better
success
in
a
third
attempt
however
he
wended
his
way
northwards
with
his
family
and
oswell
along
the
chobé
an
affluent
of
the
zambesi
and
after
a
difficult
journey
at
length
reached
the
district
of
the
makalolos
of
whom
the
chief
named
sebituané
joined
him
at
linyanté
the
zambesi
itself
was
discovered
at
the
end
of
june
and
the
doctor
returned
to
the
cape
for
the
purpose
of
sending
his
family
to
england
illustration
livingstone
his
next
project
was
to
cross
the
continent
obliquely
from
south
to
west
but
in
this
expedition
he
had
resolved
that
he
would
risk
no
life
but
his
own
accompanied
therefore
by
only
a
few
natives
he
started
in
the
following
june
and
skirting
the
kalahari
desert
entered
litoubarouba
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
here
he
found
the
bechuana
district
much
ravaged
by
the
boers
the
original
dutch
colonists
who
had
formed
the
population
of
the
cape
before
it
came
into
the
possession
of
the
english
after
a
fortnight
stay
he
proceeded
into
the
heart
of
the
district
of
the
bamangonatos
and
travelled
continuously
until
the
of
may
when
he
arrived
at
linyanté
and
was
received
with
much
honour
by
sekeletoo
who
had
recently
become
sovereign
of
the
makalolos
a
severe
attack
of
fever
detained
the
traveller
here
for
a
period
but
he
made
good
use
of
the
enforced
rest
by
studying
the
manners
of
the
country
and
became
for
the
first
time
sensible
of
its
terrible
sufferings
in
consequence
of
the
descending
the
course
of
the
chobé
to
the
zambesi
he
next
entered
naniele
and
after
visiting
katonga
and
libonta
advanced
to
the
point
of
confluence
of
the
leeba
with
the
zambesi
where
he
determined
upon
ascending
the
former
as
far
as
the
portuguese
possessions
in
the
west
it
was
an
undertaking
however
that
required
considerable
preparation
so
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
return
to
linyanté
on
the
of
november
he
again
started
he
was
accompanied
by
makalolos
and
ascended
the
leeba
till
in
the
territory
of
the
balonda
he
reached
a
spot
where
it
received
the
waters
of
its
tributary
the
makondo
it
was
the
first
time
a
white
man
had
ever
penetrated
so
far
proceeding
on
their
way
they
arrived
at
the
residence
of
shinté
the
most
powerful
of
the
chieftains
of
the
balonda
by
whom
they
were
well
received
and
having
met
with
equal
kindness
from
kateema
a
ruler
on
the
other
side
of
the
leeba
they
encamped
on
the
of
february
on
the
banks
of
lake
dilolo
here
it
was
that
the
real
difficulty
commenced
the
arduous
travelling
the
attacks
of
the
natives
and
their
exorbitant
demands
the
conspiracies
of
his
own
attendants
and
their
desertions
would
soon
have
caused
any
one
of
less
energy
to
abandon
his
enterprise
but
david
livingstone
was
not
a
man
to
be
daunted
resolutely
he
persevered
and
on
the
of
april
reached
the
banks
of
the
coango
the
stream
that
forms
the
frontier
of
the
portuguese
possessions
and
joins
the
zaire
on
the
north
six
days
later
he
passed
through
cassangé
here
it
was
that
alvez
had
seen
him
on
the
of
may
he
arrived
at
paul
de
loanda
having
traversed
the
continent
in
about
two
years
it
was
not
long
however
before
he
was
off
again
following
the
banks
of
the
coanza
the
river
which
was
to
bring
such
trying
experiences
to
dick
sands
and
his
party
he
reached
the
lombé
and
having
met
numbers
of
on
his
way
again
passed
through
cassange
crossed
the
coango
and
reached
the
zambesi
at
kewawa
by
the
of
the
following
june
he
was
again
at
lake
dilolo
and
descending
the
river
he
linyanté
here
he
stayed
till
the
of
november
when
he
commenced
his
second
great
journey
which
was
to
carry
him
completely
across
africa
from
west
to
east
after
visiting
the
famed
victoria
falls
the
intrepid
explorer
quitted
the
zambesi
and
took
a
route
the
transit
of
the
territory
of
the
batokas
a
people
brutalized
by
the
inhalation
of
hemp
a
visit
to
semalemboni
the
powerful
chief
of
the
district
the
passage
of
the
kafoni
a
visit
to
king
mbourouma
an
inspection
of
the
ruins
of
zumbo
an
old
portuguese
town
a
meeting
with
the
chief
mpendé
at
that
time
at
war
with
the
portuguese
these
were
the
principal
events
of
this
journey
and
on
the
of
april
livingstone
left
teté
and
having
descended
the
river
as
far
as
its
delta
reached
quilimané
just
four
years
after
his
last
departure
from
the
cape
on
the
of
july
he
embarked
for
the
mauritius
and
on
the
of
december
he
landed
in
england
after
an
absence
of
sixteen
years
illustration
with
none
to
guide
him
except
a
few
natives
loaded
with
honours
by
the
geographical
societies
of
london
and
paris
brilliantly
entertained
by
all
ranks
it
would
have
been
no
matter
of
surprise
if
he
had
surrendered
himself
to
a
repose
but
no
thought
of
permanent
rest
occurred
to
him
and
on
the
of
march
accompanied
by
his
brother
charles
captain
bedingfield
kirk
miller
thornton
and
baines
he
started
again
with
the
intention
of
exploring
the
basin
of
the
zambesi
and
arrived
in
due
time
at
the
coast
of
mozambique
the
party
ascended
the
great
river
by
the
kongone
mouth
they
were
on
board
a
small
steamer
named
the
and
reached
teté
on
the
of
september
during
the
following
year
they
investigated
the
lower
course
of
the
zambesi
and
its
left
affluent
the
shiré
and
having
visited
lake
shirwa
they
explored
the
territory
of
the
manganjas
and
discovered
lake
nyassa
in
august
they
returned
to
the
victoria
falls
early
in
the
following
year
bishop
mackenzie
and
his
missionary
staff
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
zambesi
in
march
an
exploration
of
the
rovouma
was
made
on
board
the
pioneer
the
exploring
party
returning
afterwards
to
lake
nyassa
where
they
remained
a
considerable
time
the
of
january
was
signalized
by
the
arrival
of
livingstone
and
by
the
addition
of
another
steamer
the
lady
nyassa
but
the
happiness
of
reunion
was
very
transient
it
was
but
a
short
time
before
the
enthusiastic
bishop
mackenzie
succumbed
to
the
unhealthiness
of
the
climate
and
on
the
of
april
livingstone
expired
in
her
husband
arms
a
second
investigation
of
the
rovouma
soon
followed
and
at
the
end
of
november
the
doctor
returned
to
the
zambesi
and
reascended
the
shire
in
the
spring
of
he
lost
his
companion
thornton
and
as
his
brother
and
kirk
were
both
much
debilitated
he
insisted
upon
their
return
to
europe
while
he
himself
returned
for
the
third
time
to
lake
nyassa
and
completed
the
hydrographical
survey
which
already
he
had
begun
a
few
months
later
found
him
once
more
at
the
mouth
of
the
zambesi
thence
he
crossed
over
to
zanzibar
and
after
five
years
absence
arrived
in
london
where
he
published
his
work
the
exploration
of
the
zambesi
and
its
affluents
still
unwearied
and
insatiable
in
his
longings
he
was
back
again
in
zanzibar
at
the
commencement
of
ready
to
begin
his
fourth
journey
this
time
attended
only
by
a
few
sepoys
and
negroes
witnessing
on
his
way
some
horrible
scenes
which
were
perpetrated
as
the
result
of
the
prosecution
of
the
he
proceeded
to
mokalaosé
on
the
shores
of
lake
nyassa
where
nearly
all
his
attendants
deserted
him
and
returned
to
zanzibar
with
the
report
that
he
was
dead
livingstone
meanwhile
was
not
only
alive
but
undaunted
in
his
determination
to
visit
the
country
between
the
two
lakes
nyassa
and
tanganyika
with
none
to
guide
him
except
a
few
natives
he
crossed
the
loangona
and
in
the
following
april
discovered
lake
liemmba
here
he
lay
for
a
whole
month
hovering
between
life
and
death
but
rallying
a
little
he
pushed
on
to
the
north
shore
of
lake
moero
taking
up
his
quarters
at
cazembé
for
six
weeks
he
made
two
separate
explorations
of
the
lake
and
then
started
farther
northwards
intending
to
reach
ujiji
an
important
town
upon
lake
tanganyika
overtaken
however
by
floods
and
again
abandoned
by
his
servants
he
was
obliged
to
retrace
his
steps
six
weeks
afterwards
he
had
made
his
way
southwards
to
the
great
lake
bangweolo
whence
once
more
he
started
towards
tanganyika
this
last
effort
was
most
trying
and
the
doctor
had
grown
so
weak
that
he
was
obliged
to
be
carried
but
he
reached
ujiji
where
he
was
gratified
by
finding
some
supplies
that
had
been
thoughtfully
forwarded
to
him
by
the
oriental
society
at
calcutta
illustration
you
are
livingstone
i
presume
his
great
aim
now
was
to
ascend
the
lake
and
reach
the
sources
of
the
nile
on
the
of
september
he
was
at
bambarré
in
the
country
of
the
cannibal
manyuema
upon
the
lualaba
the
river
afterwards
ascertained
by
stanley
to
be
the
upper
zaire
or
congo
at
mamobela
the
doctor
was
ill
for
days
tended
only
by
three
followers
who
continued
faithful
but
in
july
he
made
a
vigorous
effort
and
although
he
was
reduced
to
a
skeleton
made
his
way
back
to
ujiji
during
this
long
time
no
tidings
of
livingstone
reached
europe
and
many
were
the
misgivings
lest
the
rumours
of
his
death
were
only
too
true
he
was
himself
too
almost
despairing
as
to
receiving
any
help
but
help
was
closer
at
hand
than
he
thought
on
the
of
november
only
eleven
days
after
his
return
to
ujiji
some
gun
shots
were
heard
within
half
a
mile
of
the
lake
the
doctor
went
out
to
ascertain
whence
they
proceeded
and
had
not
gone
far
before
a
white
man
stood
before
him
you
are
livingstone
i
presume
said
the
stranger
raising
his
cap
yes
sir
i
am
livingstone
and
am
happy
to
see
you
answered
the
doctor
smiling
kindly
the
two
shook
each
other
warmly
by
the
hand
the
new
arrival
was
henry
stanley
the
correspondent
of
the
york
who
had
been
sent
out
by
bennett
the
editor
in
search
of
the
great
african
explorer
on
receiving
his
orders
in
october
without
a
day
unnecessary
delay
he
had
embarked
at
bombay
for
zanzibar
and
after
a
journey
involving
considerable
peril
had
arrived
safely
at
ujiji
very
soon
the
two
travellers
found
themselves
on
the
best
of
terms
and
set
out
together
on
an
excursion
to
the
north
of
tanganyika
they
proceeded
as
far
as
cape
magala
and
decided
that
the
chief
outlet
of
the
lake
must
be
an
affluent
of
the
lualaba
a
conclusion
that
was
subsequently
confirmed
by
cameron
towards
the
end
of
the
year
stanley
began
to
prepare
to
return
livingstone
accompanied
him
as
far
as
kwihara
and
on
the
of
the
following
march
they
parted
you
have
done
for
me
what
few
men
would
venture
to
do
i
am
truly
grateful
said
livingstone
stanley
could
scarcely
repress
his
tears
as
he
expressed
his
hope
that
the
doctor
might
be
spared
to
return
to
his
friends
safe
and
well
said
stanley
choked
with
emotion
answered
the
veteran
feebly
thus
they
parted
and
in
july
stanley
landed
at
marseilles
again
david
livingstone
resumed
his
researches
in
the
interior
after
remaining
five
months
at
kwihara
he
gathered
together
a
retinue
consisting
of
his
faithful
followers
suzi
chumah
amoda
and
jacob
wainwright
and
men
sent
to
him
by
stanley
and
lost
no
time
in
proceeding
towards
the
south
of
tanganyika
in
the
course
of
the
ensuing
month
the
caravan
encountered
some
frightful
storms
but
succeeded
in
reaching
moura
there
had
previously
been
an
extreme
drought
which
was
now
followed
by
the
rainy
season
which
entailed
the
loss
of
many
of
the
beasts
of
burden
in
consequence
of
the
bites
of
the
tzetsy
on
the
of
january
they
were
at
chitounkwé
and
in
april
after
rounding
the
east
of
lake
bangweolo
they
made
their
way
towards
the
village
of
chitambo
at
this
point
it
was
that
livingstone
had
parted
company
with
certain
who
had
carried
the
information
to
old
alvez
that
the
missionary
traveller
would
very
likely
proceed
by
way
of
loanda
to
kazonndé
but
on
the
of
june
the
very
day
before
negoro
reckoned
on
obtaining
from
weldon
the
letter
which
should
be
the
means
of
securing
him
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
tidings
were
circulated
in
the
district
that
on
the
of
may
livingstone
had
breathed
his
last
the
report
proved
perfectly
true
on
the
of
april
the
caravan
had
reached
the
village
of
chitambo
the
doctor
so
unwell
that
he
was
carried
on
a
litter
the
following
night
he
was
in
great
pain
and
after
repeatedly
murmuring
in
a
low
voice
oh
dear
oh
dear
he
fell
into
a
kind
of
stupor
a
short
time
afterwards
he
called
up
suzi
and
having
asked
for
some
medicine
told
his
attendant
that
he
should
not
require
anything
more
you
can
go
now
about
four
next
morning
when
an
anxious
visit
was
made
to
his
room
the
doctor
was
found
kneeling
by
the
his
head
in
his
hands
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
suzi
touched
him
but
his
forehead
was
icy
with
the
coldness
of
death
he
had
died
in
the
night
his
body
was
carried
by
those
who
loved
him
and
in
spite
of
many
obstacles
was
brought
to
zanzibar
whence
nine
months
after
his
death
it
was
conveyed
to
england
on
the
of
april
it
was
interred
in
westminster
abbey
counted
worthy
to
be
deposited
amongst
those
whom
the
country
most
delights
to
honour
chapter
xv
an
exciting
chase
to
say
the
truth
it
was
the
very
vaguest
of
hopes
to
which
weldon
had
been
clinging
yet
it
was
not
without
some
thrill
of
disappointment
that
she
heard
from
the
lips
of
old
alvez
himself
that
livingstone
had
died
at
a
little
village
on
lake
bangweolo
there
had
appeared
to
be
a
sort
of
a
link
binding
her
to
the
civilized
world
but
it
was
now
abruptly
snapped
and
nothing
remained
for
her
but
to
make
what
terms
she
could
with
the
base
and
heartless
negoro
on
the
the
day
appointed
for
the
interview
he
made
his
appearance
at
the
hut
firmly
resolved
to
make
no
abatement
in
the
terms
that
he
had
proposed
weldon
on
her
part
being
equally
determined
not
to
yield
to
the
demand
there
is
only
one
condition
she
avowed
upon
which
i
will
acquiesce
my
husband
shall
not
be
required
to
come
up
the
country
here
negoro
hesitated
at
length
he
said
that
he
would
agree
to
her
husband
being
taken
by
ship
to
mossamedes
a
small
port
in
the
south
of
angola
much
frequented
by
slavers
whither
also
at
a
date
hereafter
to
be
fixed
alvez
should
send
herself
with
jack
and
benedict
the
stipulation
was
confirmed
that
the
ransom
should
be
dollars
and
it
was
further
made
part
of
the
contract
that
negoro
should
be
allowed
to
depart
as
an
honest
man
weldon
felt
she
had
gained
an
important
point
in
thus
sparing
her
husband
the
necessity
of
a
journey
to
kazonndé
and
had
no
apprehensions
about
herself
on
her
way
to
mossamedes
knowing
that
it
was
to
the
interest
of
alvez
and
negoro
alike
to
attend
carefully
to
her
wants
upon
the
terms
of
the
covenant
being
thus
arranged
weldon
wrote
such
a
letter
to
her
husband
as
she
knew
would
bring
him
with
all
speed
to
mossamedes
but
she
left
it
entirely
to
negoro
to
represent
himself
in
whatever
light
he
chose
once
in
possession
of
the
document
negoro
lost
no
time
in
starting
on
his
errand
the
very
next
morning
taking
with
him
about
twenty
negroes
he
set
off
towards
the
north
alleging
to
alvez
as
his
motive
for
taking
that
direction
that
he
was
not
only
going
to
embark
somewhere
at
the
mouth
of
the
congo
but
that
he
was
anxious
to
keep
as
far
as
possible
from
the
of
the
portuguese
with
which
already
he
had
been
involuntarily
only
too
familiar
after
his
departure
weldon
resolved
to
make
the
best
of
her
period
of
imprisonment
aware
that
it
could
hardly
be
less
than
four
months
before
he
would
return
she
had
no
desire
to
go
beyond
the
precincts
assigned
her
even
had
the
privilege
been
allowed
her
but
warned
by
negoro
that
hercules
was
still
free
and
might
at
any
time
attempt
a
rescue
alvez
had
no
thought
of
permitting
her
any
unnecessary
liberty
her
life
therefore
soon
resumed
its
previous
monotony
the
daily
routine
went
on
within
the
enclosure
pretty
much
as
in
other
parts
of
the
town
the
women
all
being
employed
in
various
labours
for
the
benefit
of
their
husbands
and
masters
the
rice
was
pounded
with
wooden
pestles
the
maize
was
peeled
and
winnowed
previously
to
extracting
the
granulous
substance
for
the
drink
which
they
call
the
sorghum
had
to
be
gathered
in
the
season
of
its
ripening
being
marked
by
festive
observances
there
was
a
fragrant
oil
to
be
expressed
from
a
kind
of
olive
named
the
the
cotton
had
to
be
spun
on
spindles
which
were
hardly
less
than
a
foot
and
a
half
in
length
there
was
the
bark
of
trees
to
be
woven
into
textures
for
wearing
the
manioc
had
to
be
dug
up
and
the
cassava
procured
from
its
roots
and
besides
all
this
there
was
the
preparation
of
the
soil
for
its
future
plantings
the
usual
productions
of
the
country
being
the
beans
growing
in
pods
fifteen
inches
long
upon
stems
twenty
feet
high
the
from
which
they
procure
a
serviceable
oil
the
pea
the
blossoms
of
which
are
used
to
give
a
flavour
to
the
insipid
sorghum
cucumbers
of
which
the
seeds
are
roasted
as
chestnuts
as
well
as
the
common
crops
of
coffee
sugar
onions
guavas
and
sesame
to
the
women
lot
too
falls
the
manipulation
of
all
the
fermented
drinks
the
made
from
bananas
the
and
various
other
liquors
nor
should
the
care
of
all
the
domestic
animals
be
forgotten
the
cows
that
will
not
allow
themselves
to
be
milked
unless
they
can
see
their
calf
or
a
stuffed
representative
of
it
the
heifers
that
not
unfrequently
have
a
hump
the
goats
that
like
slaves
form
part
of
the
currency
of
the
country
the
pigs
the
sheep
and
the
poultry
the
men
meanwhile
smoke
their
hemp
or
tobacco
hunt
buffaloes
or
elephants
or
are
hired
by
the
dealers
to
join
in
the
the
harvest
of
slaves
in
fact
being
a
thing
of
as
regular
and
periodic
recurrence
as
the
ingathering
of
the
maize
in
her
daily
strolls
weldon
would
occasionally
pause
to
watch
the
women
but
they
only
responded
to
her
notice
by
a
long
stare
or
by
a
hideous
grimace
a
kind
of
natural
instinct
made
them
hate
a
white
skin
and
they
had
no
spark
of
commiseration
for
the
stranger
who
had
been
brought
among
them
halima
however
was
a
marked
exception
she
grew
more
and
more
devoted
to
her
mistress
and
by
degrees
the
two
became
able
to
exchange
many
sentences
in
the
native
dialect
jack
generally
accompanied
his
mother
naturally
enough
he
longed
to
get
outside
the
enclosure
but
still
he
found
considerable
amusement
in
watching
the
birds
that
built
in
a
huge
baobab
that
grew
within
there
were
maraboos
making
their
nests
with
twigs
there
were
with
nests
like
widow
birds
that
helped
themselves
liberally
to
the
thatch
of
the
huts
with
their
tuneful
song
grey
parrots
with
bright
red
tails
called
by
the
manyuema
who
apply
the
same
name
to
their
reigning
chiefs
and
like
grey
linnets
with
large
red
beaks
hundreds
of
butterflies
flitted
about
especially
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
brooks
but
these
were
more
to
the
taste
of
cousin
benedict
than
of
little
jack
over
and
over
again
the
child
expressed
his
regret
that
he
could
not
see
over
the
walls
and
more
than
ever
he
seemed
to
miss
his
friend
dick
who
had
taught
him
to
climb
a
mast
and
who
he
was
sure
would
have
fine
fun
with
him
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
which
were
growing
sometimes
to
the
height
of
a
hundred
feet
illustration
the
insufferable
heat
had
driven
all
the
residents
within
the
depót
indoors
so
long
as
the
supply
of
insects
did
not
fail
benedict
would
have
been
contented
to
stay
on
without
a
murmur
in
his
present
quarters
true
without
his
glasses
he
worked
at
a
disadvantage
but
he
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
discover
a
minute
bee
that
forms
its
cells
in
the
holes
of
wood
and
a
sphex
that
practises
the
craft
of
the
cuckoo
and
deposits
its
eggs
in
an
abode
not
prepared
by
itself
mosquitos
abounded
in
swarms
and
the
worthy
naturalist
was
so
covered
by
their
stings
as
to
be
hardly
recognizable
but
when
weldon
remonstrated
with
him
for
exposing
himself
so
unnecessarily
he
merely
scratched
the
irritated
places
on
his
skin
and
said
it
is
their
instinct
you
know
it
is
their
instinct
on
the
of
june
an
adventure
happened
to
him
which
was
attended
with
unexpected
consequences
it
was
about
eleven
in
the
morning
the
insufferable
heat
had
driven
all
the
residents
within
the
dépôt
indoors
and
not
a
native
was
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
of
kazonndé
weldon
was
dozing
jack
was
fast
asleep
benedict
himself
sorely
against
his
will
for
he
heard
the
hum
of
many
an
insect
in
the
sunshine
had
been
driven
to
the
seclusion
of
his
cabin
and
was
falling
into
an
involuntary
siesta
suddenly
a
buzz
was
heard
an
insect
wing
vibrating
some
fifteen
thousand
beats
a
second
a
hexapod
cried
benedict
sitting
up
though
he
was
his
hearing
was
acute
and
his
perception
made
him
thoroughly
convinced
that
he
was
in
proximity
to
some
giant
specimen
of
its
kind
without
moving
from
his
seat
he
did
his
utmost
to
ascertain
what
it
was
he
was
determined
not
to
flinch
from
the
sharpest
of
stings
if
only
he
could
get
the
chance
of
capturing
it
presently
he
made
out
a
large
black
speck
flitting
about
in
the
few
rays
of
daylight
that
were
allowed
to
penetrate
the
hut
with
bated
breath
he
waited
in
eager
expectation
the
insect
after
long
hovering
above
him
finally
settled
on
his
head
a
smile
of
satisfaction
played
about
his
lips
as
he
felt
it
crawling
lightly
through
his
hair
equally
fearful
of
missing
or
injuring
it
he
restrained
his
first
impulse
to
grasp
it
in
his
hand
i
will
wait
a
minute
he
thought
perhaps
it
may
creep
down
my
nose
by
squinting
a
little
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
see
it
for
some
moments
hope
alternated
with
fear
there
sat
benedict
with
what
he
persuaded
himself
was
some
new
african
hexapod
perched
upon
his
head
and
agitated
by
doubts
as
to
the
direction
in
which
it
would
move
instead
of
travelling
in
the
way
he
reckoned
along
his
nose
might
it
not
crawl
behind
his
ears
or
down
his
neck
or
worse
than
all
resume
its
flight
in
the
air
fortune
seemed
inclined
to
favour
him
after
threading
the
entanglement
of
the
naturalist
hair
the
insect
was
felt
to
be
descending
his
forehead
with
a
fortitude
not
unworthy
of
the
spartan
who
suffered
his
breast
to
be
gnawed
by
a
fox
nor
of
the
roman
hero
who
plunged
his
hand
into
the
coals
benedict
endured
the
tickling
of
the
six
small
feet
and
made
not
a
motion
that
might
frighten
the
creature
into
taking
wing
after
making
repeated
circuits
of
his
forehead
it
passed
just
between
his
eyebrows
there
was
a
moment
of
deep
suspense
lest
it
should
once
more
go
upwards
but
it
soon
began
to
move
again
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
did
it
turn
but
kept
straight
on
over
the
furrows
made
by
the
constant
rubbing
of
the
spectacles
right
along
the
arch
of
the
cartilage
till
it
reached
the
extreme
tip
of
the
nose
like
a
couple
of
movable
lenses
benedict
two
eyes
steadily
turned
themselves
inwards
till
they
were
directed
to
the
proper
point
illustration
before
long
the
old
black
speck
was
again
flitting
just
above
his
head
good
he
whispered
to
himself
he
was
exulting
at
the
discovery
that
what
he
had
been
waiting
for
so
patiently
was
a
rare
specimen
of
the
tribe
of
the
cicindelidæ
peculiar
to
the
districts
of
southern
africa
a
tuberous
manticora
he
exclaimed
the
insect
began
to
move
again
and
as
it
crawled
down
to
the
entrance
of
the
nostrils
the
tickling
sensation
became
too
much
for
endurance
and
benedict
sneezed
he
made
a
sudden
clutch
but
of
course
he
only
caught
his
own
nose
his
vexation
was
very
great
but
he
did
not
lose
his
composure
he
knew
that
the
manticora
rarely
flies
very
high
and
that
more
frequently
than
not
it
simply
crawls
accordingly
he
groped
about
a
long
time
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
at
last
he
found
it
basking
in
a
ray
of
sunshine
within
a
foot
of
him
his
resolution
was
soon
taken
he
would
not
run
the
risk
of
crushing
it
by
trying
to
catch
it
but
would
make
his
observations
on
it
as
it
crawled
and
so
with
his
nose
close
to
the
ground
like
a
dog
upon
the
scent
he
followed
it
on
all
fours
admiring
it
and
examining
it
as
it
moved
regardless
of
the
heat
he
not
only
left
the
doorway
of
his
hut
but
continued
creeping
along
till
he
reached
the
enclosing
palisade
at
the
foot
of
the
fence
the
manticora
according
to
the
habits
of
its
kind
began
to
seek
a
subterranean
retreat
and
coming
to
the
opening
of
a
entered
it
at
once
benedict
quite
thought
he
had
now
lost
sight
of
his
prize
altogether
but
his
surprise
was
very
great
when
he
found
that
the
aperture
was
at
least
two
feet
wide
and
that
it
led
into
a
gallery
which
would
admit
his
whole
body
his
momentary
feeling
of
astonishment
however
gave
way
to
his
eagerness
to
follow
up
the
hexapod
and
he
continued
burrowing
like
a
ferret
without
knowing
it
he
actually
passed
under
the
palisading
and
was
now
beyond
it
the
in
fact
was
a
communication
that
had
been
made
between
the
interior
and
exterior
of
the
enclosure
benedict
had
obtained
his
freedom
but
so
far
from
caring
in
the
least
for
his
liberty
he
continued
totally
absorbed
in
the
pursuit
upon
which
he
had
started
he
watched
with
unflagging
vigilance
and
it
was
only
when
the
hexapod
expanded
its
wings
as
if
for
flight
that
he
prepared
to
imprison
it
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
all
at
once
however
he
was
taken
by
surprise
a
whizz
and
a
whirr
and
the
prize
was
gone
disappointed
rather
than
despairing
benedict
raised
himself
up
and
looked
about
him
before
long
the
old
black
speck
was
again
flitting
just
above
his
head
there
was
every
reason
to
hope
that
it
would
ultimately
settle
once
more
upon
the
ground
but
on
this
side
of
the
palisade
there
was
a
large
forest
a
little
way
to
the
north
and
if
the
manticora
were
to
get
into
its
mass
of
foliage
all
hope
of
keeping
it
in
view
would
be
lost
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
the
proud
expectation
of
storing
it
in
the
tin
box
to
be
preserved
among
the
rest
of
the
entomological
wonders
after
a
while
the
insect
descended
to
the
earth
it
did
not
rest
at
all
nor
crawl
as
it
had
done
previously
but
made
its
advance
by
a
series
of
rapid
hops
this
made
the
chase
for
the
naturalist
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
he
put
his
face
as
close
to
the
ground
as
possible
and
kept
starting
off
and
stopping
and
starting
off
again
with
his
arms
extended
like
a
swimming
frog
continually
making
frantic
clutches
to
find
as
continually
that
his
grasp
had
been
eluded
after
running
till
he
was
out
of
breath
and
scratching
his
hands
against
the
brushwood
and
the
foliage
till
they
bled
he
had
the
mortification
of
feeling
the
insect
dash
past
his
ear
with
what
might
be
a
defiant
buzz
and
finding
that
it
was
out
of
sight
for
ever
ungrateful
hexapod
he
cried
in
dismay
i
intended
to
honour
you
with
the
best
place
in
my
collection
illustration
for
that
day
at
least
cousin
benedict
had
lost
his
chance
of
being
the
happiest
of
entomologists
he
knew
not
what
to
do
and
could
not
reconcile
himself
to
the
loss
he
reproached
himself
for
not
having
secured
the
manticora
at
the
first
he
gazed
at
the
forest
till
he
persuaded
himself
he
could
see
the
coveted
insect
in
the
distance
and
seized
with
a
frantic
impulse
exclaimed
i
will
have
you
yet
he
did
not
even
yet
realize
the
fact
that
he
had
gained
his
liberty
but
heedless
of
everything
except
his
own
burning
disappointment
and
at
the
risk
of
being
attacked
by
natives
or
beset
by
wild
beasts
he
was
just
on
the
very
point
of
dashing
into
the
heart
of
the
wood
when
suddenly
a
giant
form
confronted
him
as
suddenly
a
giant
hand
seized
him
by
the
nape
of
his
neck
and
lifting
him
up
carried
him
off
with
apparently
as
little
exertion
as
he
could
himself
have
carried
off
his
hexapod
for
that
day
at
least
cousin
benedict
had
lost
his
chance
of
being
the
happiest

chapter
xvi
a
magician
on
finding
that
cousin
benedict
did
not
return
to
his
quarters
at
the
proper
hour
weldon
began
to
feel
uneasy
she
could
not
imagine
what
had
become
of
him
his
tin
box
with
its
contents
were
safe
in
his
hut
and
even
if
a
chance
of
escape
had
been
offered
him
she
knew
that
nothing
would
have
induced
him
voluntarily
to
abandon
his
treasures
she
enlisted
the
services
of
halima
and
spent
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
searching
for
him
until
at
last
she
felt
herself
driven
to
the
conviction
that
he
must
have
been
confined
by
the
orders
of
alvez
himself
for
what
reason
she
could
not
divine
as
benedict
had
undoubtedly
been
included
in
the
number
of
prisoners
to
be
delivered
to
weldon
for
the
stipulated
ransom
but
the
rage
of
the
trader
when
he
heard
of
the
escape
of
the
captive
was
an
ample
proof
that
he
had
had
no
hand
in
his
disappearance
a
rigorous
search
was
instituted
in
every
direction
which
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
the
here
beyond
a
question
was
the
passage
through
which
the
had
found
his
way
idiot
fool
rascal
muttered
alvez
full
of
rage
at
the
prospect
of
losing
a
portion
of
the
if
ever
i
get
hold
of
him
he
shall
pay
dearly
for
this
freak
the
opening
was
at
once
blocked
up
the
woods
were
scoured
all
round
for
a
considerable
distance
but
no
trace
of
benedict
was
to
be
found
weldon
was
bitterly
grieved
and
much
overcome
but
she
had
no
alternative
except
to
resign
herself
as
best
she
could
to
the
loss
of
her
unfortunate
relation
there
was
a
tinge
of
bitterness
in
her
anxiety
for
she
could
not
help
being
irritated
at
the
recklessness
with
which
he
had
withdrawn
himself
from
the
reach
of
her
protection
meanwhile
the
weather
for
the
time
of
year
underwent
a
very
unusual
change
although
the
rainy
season
is
ordinarily
reckoned
to
terminate
about
the
end
of
april
the
sky
had
suddenly
become
overcast
in
the
middle
of
june
rain
had
recommenced
falling
and
the
downpour
had
been
so
heavy
and
continuous
that
all
the
ground
was
thoroughly
sodden
to
weldon
personally
this
incessant
rainfall
brought
no
other
inconvenience
beyond
depriving
her
of
her
daily
exercise
but
to
the
natives
in
general
it
was
a
very
serious
calamity
the
ripening
crops
in
the
districts
were
completely
flooded
and
the
inhabitants
feared
that
they
would
be
reduced
to
the
greatest
extremities
all
agricultural
pursuits
had
come
to
a
standstill
and
neither
the
queen
nor
her
ministers
could
devise
any
expedient
to
avert
or
mitigate
the
misfortune
they
resolved
at
last
to
have
recourse
to
the
magicians
not
those
who
are
called
in
request
to
heal
diseases
or
to
procure
good
luck
but
to
the
sorcerers
of
a
superior
order
who
are
credited
with
the
faculty
of
invoking
or
dispelling
rain
but
it
was
all
to
no
purpose
it
was
in
vain
that
the
monotoned
their
incantations
flourished
their
rattles
jingled
their
bells
and
exhibited
their
amulets
it
was
equally
without
avail
that
they
rolled
up
their
balls
of
dirt
and
spat
in
the
faces
of
all
the
courtiers
the
pitiless
rain
continued
to
descend
and
the
malign
influences
that
were
ruling
the
clouds
refused
to
be
propitiated
the
prospect
seemed
to
become
more
and
more
hopeless
when
the
report
was
brought
to
moena
that
there
was
a
most
wonderful
resident
in
the
north
of
angola
he
had
never
been
seen
in
this
part
of
the
country
but
fame
declared
him
to
be
a
magician
of
the
very
highest
order
application
without
delay
should
be
made
to
him
he
surely
would
be
able
to
stay
the
rain
early
in
the
morning
of
the
a
great
tinkling
of
bells
announced
the
magician
arrival
at
kazonndé
the
natives
poured
out
to
meet
him
on
his
way
to
the
their
minds
being
already
predisposed
in
his
favour
by
a
moderation
of
the
downpour
and
by
sundry
indications
of
a
coming
change
of
wind
the
ordinary
practice
of
the
professors
of
the
magical
art
is
to
perambulate
the
villages
in
parties
of
three
or
four
accompanied
by
a
considerable
number
of
acolytes
and
assistants
in
this
case
the
came
entirely
alone
he
was
a
pure
negro
of
most
imposing
stature
more
than
six
feet
high
and
broad
in
proportion
all
over
his
chest
was
a
fantastic
pattern
traced
in
the
lower
portion
of
his
body
being
covered
with
a
flowing
skirt
of
woven
grass
so
long
that
it
made
a
train
round
his
neck
hung
a
string
of
birds
skulls
upon
his
head
he
wore
a
leathern
helmet
ornamented
with
pearls
and
plumes
and
about
his
waist
was
a
copper
girdle
to
which
was
attached
bells
that
tinkled
like
the
harness
of
a
spanish
mule
the
only
instrument
indicating
his
art
was
a
basket
he
carried
made
of
a
calabash
containing
shells
amulets
little
wooden
idols
and
other
fetishes
together
with
what
was
more
important
than
all
a
large
number
of
those
balls
of
dung
without
which
no
african
ceremony
of
divination
could
ever
be
complete
one
peculiarity
was
soon
discovered
by
the
crowd
the
was
dumb
and
could
utter
only
one
low
guttural
sound
which
was
quite
unintelligible
this
was
a
circumstance
however
that
seemed
only
to
augment
their
faith
in
his
powers
with
a
stately
strut
that
brought
all
his
tinkling
paraphernalia
into
full
play
the
magician
proceeded
to
make
the
circuit
of
the
the
natives
followed
in
a
troop
behind
endeavouring
like
monkeys
to
imitate
his
every
movement
he
turned
into
the
main
thoroughfare
and
began
to
make
his
way
direct
to
the
royal
residence
whence
as
soon
as
the
queen
heard
of
his
approach
she
advanced
to
meet
him
on
seeing
her
the
bowed
to
the
very
dust
then
rearing
himself
to
his
full
height
he
pointed
aloft
and
by
the
significance
of
his
animated
gestures
indicated
that
although
the
fleeting
clouds
were
now
going
to
the
west
they
would
soon
return
eastwards
with
a
rotatory
motion
irresistibly
strong
illustration
the
entire
crowd
joined
in
all
at
once
to
the
surprise
of
the
beholders
he
stooped
and
took
the
hand
of
the
mighty
sovereign
of
kazonndé
the
courtiers
hurried
forward
to
check
the
unprecedented
breach
of
etiquette
but
the
foremost
was
driven
back
with
so
staggering
a
blow
that
the
others
deemed
it
prudent
to
retire
the
queen
herself
appeared
not
to
take
the
least
offence
at
the
familiarity
she
bestowed
a
hideous
grimace
which
was
meant
for
a
smile
upon
her
illustrious
visitor
who
still
keeping
his
hold
upon
her
hand
started
off
walking
at
a
rapid
pace
the
crowd
following
in
the
rear
he
directed
his
steps
towards
the
residence
of
alvez
and
finding
the
door
closed
applied
his
strong
shoulder
to
it
with
such
effect
that
it
fell
bodily
to
the
ground
and
the
passive
sovereign
stood
within
the
limits
of
the
enclosure
the
trader
was
about
to
summon
his
slaves
and
soldiers
to
repel
the
unceremonious
invasion
of
his
premises
but
on
beholding
the
queen
all
stepped
back
with
respectful
reverence
before
alvez
had
time
to
ask
the
sovereign
to
what
cause
he
was
indebted
for
the
honour
of
her
visit
the
magician
had
cleared
a
wide
space
around
him
and
had
once
again
commenced
his
performances
brandishing
his
arms
wildly
he
pointed
to
the
clouds
as
though
he
were
arresting
them
in
their
course
he
inflated
his
huge
cheeks
and
blew
with
all
his
strength
as
if
resolved
to
disperse
the
heavy
masses
and
then
stretching
himself
to
his
full
height
he
appeared
to
clutch
them
in
his
giant
grasp
deeply
impressed
the
superstitious
moena
was
half
beside
herself
with
excitement
she
uttered
loud
cries
and
involuntarily
began
herself
to
imitate
every
one
of
the
gestures
the
entire
crowd
joined
in
and
very
soon
the
low
guttural
note
of
the
sorcerer
was
lost
totally
drowned
in
the
turmoil
of
howls
shrieks
and
discordant
songs
to
the
chagrin
however
both
of
the
queen
and
her
subjects
there
was
not
the
slightest
intimation
that
the
clouds
above
were
going
to
permit
a
rift
by
which
the
rays
of
the
tropical
sun
could
find
a
passage
on
the
contrary
the
tokens
of
improvement
in
the
weather
which
had
been
observed
in
the
early
morning
had
all
disappeared
the
atmosphere
was
darker
than
ever
and
heavy
began
to
patter
down
a
reaction
was
beginning
to
take
place
in
the
enthusiasm
of
the
crowd
after
all
then
it
would
seem
that
this
famous
from
whom
so
much
had
been
expected
had
no
power
above
the
rest
disappointment
every
moment
grew
more
keen
and
soon
there
was
a
positive
display
of
irritation
the
natives
pressed
around
him
with
closed
fists
and
threatening
gestures
a
frown
gathered
on
moena
face
and
her
lips
opened
with
muttered
words
clear
enough
to
make
the
magician
understand
that
his
ears
were
in
jeopardy
his
position
was
evidently
becoming
critical
an
unexpected
incident
suddenly
altered
the
aspect
of
affairs
the
was
quite
tall
enough
to
see
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
and
all
at
once
pausing
in
the
midst
of
his
incantations
he
pointed
to
a
distant
corner
of
the
enclosure
all
eyes
were
instantly
turned
in
that
direction
weldon
and
jack
had
just
come
out
of
their
hut
and
catching
sight
of
them
the
stood
with
his
left
hand
pointing
towards
them
and
his
right
upstretched
towards
the
heavens
intuitively
the
multitude
comprehended
his
meaning
here
was
the
explanation
of
the
mystery
it
was
this
white
woman
with
her
child
that
had
been
the
cause
of
all
their
misery
it
was
owing
to
them
that
the
clouds
had
poured
down
this
desolating
rain
with
yells
of
execration
the
whole
mob
made
a
dash
towards
the
unfortunate
lady
who
pale
with
fright
and
rigid
as
a
statue
stood
clasping
her
boy
to
her
side
the
however
anticipated
them
having
pushed
his
way
through
the
infuriated
throng
he
seized
the
child
and
held
him
high
in
the
air
as
though
about
to
hurl
him
to
the
ground
a
to
the
offended
gods
illustration
here
they
are
captain
both
of
them
weldon
gave
a
piercing
shriek
and
fell
senseless
to
the
earth
lifting
her
up
and
making
a
sign
to
the
queen
that
all
would
now
be
right
the
retreated
carrying
both
mother
and
child
through
the
crowd
who
retreated
before
him
and
made
an
open
passage
alvez
now
felt
that
it
was
time
to
interfere
already
one
of
his
prisoners
had
eluded
his
vigilance
and
was
he
now
to
see
two
more
carried
off
before
his
eyes
was
he
to
lose
the
whole
of
the
expected
ransom
no
rather
would
he
see
kazonndé
destroyed
by
a
deluge
than
resign
his
chance
of
securing
so
good
a
prize
darting
forwards
he
attempted
to
obstruct
the
magician
progress
but
public
opinion
was
against
him
at
a
sign
from
the
queen
he
was
seized
by
the
guards
and
he
was
aware
well
enough
of
what
would
be
the
immediate
consequence
of
resistance
he
deemed
it
prudent
to
desist
from
his
obstruction
but
in
his
heart
he
bitterly
cursed
the
stupid
credulity
of
the
natives
for
supposing
that
the
blood
of
the
white
woman
or
the
child
could
avail
to
put
an
end
to
the
disasters
they
were
suffering
making
the
natives
understand
that
they
were
not
to
follow
him
the
magician
carried
off
his
burden
as
easily
as
a
lion
would
carry
a
couple
of
kids
the
lady
was
still
unconscious
and
jack
was
all
but
paralyzed
with
fright
once
free
of
the
enclosure
the
crossed
the
town
entered
the
forest
and
after
a
march
of
three
miles
during
which
he
did
not
slacken
his
pace
for
a
moment
reached
the
bank
of
a
river
which
was
flowing
towards
the
north
here
in
the
cavity
of
a
rock
concealed
by
drooping
foliage
a
canoe
was
moored
covered
with
a
kind
of
thatched
roof
on
this
the
magician
deposited
his
burden
and
sending
the
light
craft
into
with
a
vigorous
kick
exclaimed
in
a
cheery
voice
here
they
are

will
be
off

drifting
down
the
stream
off
we
go
it
was
the
voice
of
hercules
addressing
dick
sands
who
frightfully
debilitated
by
recent
sufferings
was
leaning
against
cousin
benedict
for
support
dingo
was
lying
at
his
feet
weldon
gradually
recovered
her
consciousness
looking
around
her
in
amazement
she
caught
sight
of
dick
dick
is
it
you
she
muttered
feebly
the
lad
with
some
difficulty
arose
and
took
her
hand
in
his
while
jack
overwhelmed
him
with
kisses
and
who
would
have
thought
it
was
you
hercules
that
carried
us
away
said
the
child
i
did
not
know
you
a
bit
you
were
so
dreadfully
ugly
i
was
a
sort
of
a
devil
you
know
master
jack
hercules
answered
and
the
devil
is
not
particularly
handsome
and
he
began
rubbing
his
chest
vigorously
to
get
rid
of
the
white
pattern
with
which
he
had
adorned
it
weldon
held
out
her
hand
to
him
with
a
grateful
smile
yes
weldon
he
has
saved
you
and
although
he
does
not
own
it
he
has
saved
me
too
said
dick
saved
repeated
hercules
you
must
not
talk
about
safety
for
you
are
not
saved
yet
and
pointing
to
benedict
he
continued
that
where
your
thanks
are
due
unless
he
had
come
and
informed
me
all
about
you
and
where
you
were
i
should
have
known
nothing
and
should
have
been
powerless
to
aid
you
it
was
now
five
days
since
he
had
fallen
in
with
the
entomologist
as
he
was
chasing
the
manticora
and
unceremoniously
had
carried
him
off
as
the
canoe
drifted
rapidly
along
the
stream
hercules
briefly
related
his
adventures
since
his
escape
from
the
encampment
on
the
coanza
he
described
how
he
had
followed
the
kitanda
which
was
conveying
weldon
how
in
the
course
of
his
march
he
had
found
dingo
badly
wounded
how
he
and
the
dog
together
had
reached
the
neighbourhood
of
kazonndé
and
how
he
had
contrived
to
send
a
note
to
dick
intending
to
inform
him
of
weldon
destination
then
he
went
on
to
say
that
since
his
unexpected
with
cousin
benedict
he
had
watched
very
closely
for
a
chance
to
get
into
the
guardeddépôt
but
until
now
had
entirely
failed
a
celebrated
had
been
passing
on
his
way
through
the
forest
and
he
had
resolved
upon
impersonating
him
as
a
means
of
gaining
the
admittance
he
wanted
his
strength
made
the
undertaking
sufficiently
easy
and
having
stripped
the
magician
of
his
paraphernalia
and
bound
him
securely
to
a
tree
he
painted
his
own
body
with
a
pattern
like
that
which
he
observed
on
his
victim
chest
and
having
attired
himself
with
the
magical
garments
was
quite
equipped
to
impose
upon
the
credulous
natives
the
result
of
his
stratagem
they
had
all
that
day
witnessed
he
had
hardly
finished
his
account
of
himself
when
weldon
smiling
at
his
success
turned
to
dick
and
how
all
this
time
my
dear
boy
has
it
fared
with
you
she
asked
dick
said
i
remember
very
little
to
tell
you
i
recollect
being
fastened
to
a
stake
in
the
and
the
water
rising
and
rising
till
it
was
above
my
head
my
last
thoughts
were
about
yourself
and
jack
then
everything
became
a
blank
and
i
knew
nothing
more
until
i
found
myself
amongst
the
papyrus
on
the
with
hercules
tending
me
like
a
nurse
you
see
i
am
the
right
sort
of
interposed
hercules
i
am
a
doctor
as
well
as
a
conjurer
but
tell
me
hercules
how
did
you
save
him
oh
it
was
not
a
difficult
matter
by
any
means
answered
hercules
modestly
it
was
dark
you
know
so
that
at
the
proper
moment
it
was
quite
possible
to
wade
in
amongst
the
poor
wretches
at
the
bottom
of
the
trench
and
to
wrench
the
stake
from
its
socket
anybody
could
have
done
it
cousin
benedict
could
have
done
it
dingo
too
might
have
done
it
perhaps
after
all
it
was
dingo
that
did
it
no
no
hercules
that
wo
do
cried
jack
besides
look
dingo
is
shaking
his
head
he
is
telling
you
he
did
do
it
dingo
must
not
tell
tales
master
jack
said
hercules
laughing
but
nevertheless
although
the
brave
fellow
modesty
prompted
him
to
conceal
it
it
was
clear
that
he
had
accomplished
a
daring
feat
of
which
few
would
have
ventured
to
incur
the
risk
inquiry
was
next
made
after
tom
bat
actæon
and
austin
his
countenance
fell
and
large
tears
gathered
in
his
eyes
as
hercules
told
how
he
had
seen
them
pass
through
the
forest
in
a
they
were
gone
he
feared
they
were
gone
for
ever
weldon
tried
to
console
him
with
the
hope
that
they
might
still
be
spared
to
meet
again
some
day
but
he
shook
his
head
mournfully
she
then
communicated
to
dick
the
terms
of
the
compact
that
had
been
entered
into
for
her
own
release
and
observed
that
under
the
circumstances
it
might
really
have
been
more
prudent
for
her
to
remain
in
kazonndé
then
i
have
made
a
mistake
i
have
been
an
idiot
in
bringing
you
away
said
hercules
ever
ready
to
depreciate
his
own
actions
no
said
dick
you
have
made
no
mistake
you
could
not
have
done
better
those
rascals
ten
chances
to
one
will
only
get
weldon
into
some
trap
we
must
get
to
mossamedes
before
negoro
arrives
once
there
we
shall
find
that
the
portuguese
authorities
will
lend
us
their
protection
and
when
old
alvez
arrives
to
claim
his
dollars
he
shall
receive
a
good
thrashing
for
his
pains
said
hercules
finishing
dick
sentence
and
chuckling
heartily
at
the
prospect
it
was
agreed
on
all
hands
that
it
was
most
important
that
arrival
at
mossamedes
should
be
forestalled
the
plan
which
dick
had
so
long
contemplated
of
reaching
the
coast
by
descending
some
river
seemed
now
in
a
fair
way
of
being
accomplished
and
from
the
northerly
direction
in
which
they
were
proceeding
it
was
quite
probable
that
they
would
ultimately
reach
the
zaire
and
in
that
case
not
actually
arrive
at
paul
de
loanda
but
that
would
be
immaterial
as
they
would
be
sure
of
finding
help
anywhere
in
the
colonies
of
lower
guinea
on
finding
himself
on
the
dick
first
thought
had
been
to
embark
upon
one
of
the
floating
islands
that
are
continually
to
be
seen
upon
the
surface
of
the
african
streams
but
it
happened
that
hercules
during
one
of
his
rambles
found
a
native
boat
that
had
run
adrift
it
was
just
the
discovery
that
suited
their
need
it
was
one
of
the
long
narrow
canoes
thirty
feet
in
length
by
three
or
four
in
breadth
that
with
a
large
number
of
paddles
can
be
driven
with
immense
velocity
but
by
the
aid
of
a
single
scull
can
be
safely
guided
down
the
current
of
a
stream
dick
was
somewhat
afraid
that
to
elude
observation
it
would
be
necessary
to
proceed
only
by
night
but
as
the
loss
of
twelve
hours
out
of
the
would
double
the
length
of
the
voyage
he
devised
the
plan
of
covering
the
canoe
with
a
roof
of
long
grass
supported
by
a
horizontal
pole
from
stem
to
stern
and
this
not
only
afforded
a
shelter
from
the
sun
but
so
effectually
concealed
the
craft
and
all
that
the
very
birds
mistook
it
for
one
of
the
natural
islets
and
gulls
black
and
grey
and
white
kingfishers
would
frequently
alight
upon
it
in
search
of
food
though
comparatively
free
from
fatigue
the
voyage
must
necessarily
be
long
and
by
no
means
free
from
danger
and
the
daily
supply
of
provisions
was
not
easy
to
procure
if
fishing
failed
dick
had
the
one
gun
which
hercules
had
carried
away
with
him
from
the
and
as
he
was
by
no
means
a
bad
shot
he
hoped
to
find
plenty
of
game
either
along
the
banks
or
by
firing
through
a
loophole
in
the
thatch
the
rate
of
the
current
as
far
as
he
could
tell
was
about
two
miles
an
hour
enough
to
carry
them
about
fifty
miles
a
day
it
was
a
speed
however
that
made
it
necessary
for
them
to
keep
a
sharp
for
any
rocks
or
submerged
trunks
of
trees
as
well
as
to
be
on
their
guard
against
rapids
and
cataracts
dick
strength
and
spirits
all
revived
at
the
delight
of
having
weldon
and
jack
restored
to
him
and
he
assumed
his
post
at
the
bow
of
the
canoe
directing
hercules
how
to
use
the
scull
at
the
stern
a
litter
of
soft
grass
was
made
for
weldon
who
spent
most
of
her
time
lying
thoughtfully
in
the
shade
cousin
benedict
was
very
taciturn
he
had
not
recovered
the
loss
of
the
manticora
and
frowned
ever
and
again
at
hercules
as
if
he
had
not
yet
forgiven
him
for
stopping
him
in
the
chase
jack
who
had
been
told
that
he
must
not
be
noisy
amused
himself
by
playing
with
dingo
the
first
two
days
passed
without
any
special
incident
the
stock
of
provisions
was
quite
enough
for
that
time
so
that
there
was
no
need
to
disembark
and
dick
merely
lay
to
for
a
few
hours
in
the
night
to
take
a
little
necessary
repose
the
stream
nowhere
exceeded
feet
in
breadth
the
floating
islands
moved
at
the
same
pace
as
the
canoe
and
except
from
some
unforeseen
circumstance
there
could
be
no
apprehension
of
a
collision
the
banks
were
destitute
of
human
inhabitants
but
were
richly
clothed
with
wild
plants
of
which
the
blossoms
were
of
the
most
gorgeous
colours
the
asclepiae
the
gladiolus
the
clematis
lilies
aloes
umbelliferae
arborescent
ferns
and
fragrant
shrubs
combining
on
either
hand
to
make
a
border
of
surpassing
beauty
here
and
there
the
forest
extended
to
the
very
shore
and
acacias
with
their
stiff
foliage
bauhinias
clothed
with
lichen
with
their
masses
of
pendant
roots
and
other
trees
of
splendid
growth
rose
to
the
height
of
a
hundred
feet
forming
a
shade
which
the
rays
of
the
sun
utterly
failed
to
penetrate
illustration
hercules
could
leave
the
boat
without
much
fear
of
detection
occasionally
a
wreath
of
creepers
would
form
an
arch
from
shore
to
shore
and
on
the
to
jack
great
delight
a
group
of
monkeys
was
seen
crossing
one
of
these
natural
bridges
holding
on
most
carefully
by
their
tails
lest
the
aerial
pathway
should
snap
beneath
their
weight
these
monkeys
belonging
to
a
smaller
kind
of
chimpanzee
which
are
known
in
central
africa
by
the
name

hideous
creatures
with
low
foreheads
bright
yellow
faces
and
long
upright
ears
they
herd
in
troops
of
about
ten
bark
like
dogs
and
are
much
dreaded
by
the
natives
on
account
of
their
alleged
propensity
to
carry
off
young
children
there
is
no
telling
what
predatory
designs
they
might
have
formed
against
master
jack
if
they
had
spied
him
out
but
dick
artifice
effectually
screened
him
from
their
observation
twenty
miles
further
on
the
canoe
came
to
a
sudden
standstill
what
the
matter
now
captain
cried
hercules
from
the
stern
we
have
drifted
on
to
a
grass
barrier
and
there
is
no
hope
for
it
we
shall
have
to
cut
our
way
through
answered
dick
all
right
i
dare
say
we
shall
manage
it
promptly
replied
hercules
leaving
his
rudder
to
come
in
front
the
obstruction
was
formed
by
the
interlacing
of
masses
of
the
tough
glossy
grass
known
by
the
name
of
which
when
compressed
affords
a
surface
so
compact
and
resisting
that
travellers
have
been
known
by
means
of
it
to
cross
rivers
splendid
specimens
of
lotus
plants
had
taken
root
amongst
the
vegetation
as
it
was
nearly
dark
hercules
could
leave
the
boat
without
much
fear
of
detection
and
so
effectually
did
he
wield
his
hatchet
that
in
two
hours
after
the
stoppage
the
barrier
was
hewn
asunder
and
the
light
craft
resumed
the
channel
it
must
be
owned
that
it
was
with
a
sense
of
reluctance
that
benedict
felt
the
boat
was
again
beginning
to
move
forward
the
whole
voyage
appeared
to
him
to
be
perfectly
uninteresting
and
unnecessary
not
a
single
insect
had
he
observed
since
he
left
kazonndé
and
his
most
ardent
wish
was
that
he
could
return
there
and
regain
possession
of
his
invaluable
tin
box
but
an
unlooked
for
gratification
was
in
store
for
him
hercules
who
had
been
his
pupil
long
enough
to
have
an
eye
for
the
kind
of
creature
benedict
was
ever
trying
to
secure
on
coming
back
from
his
exertions
on
the
brought
a
animal
and
submitted
it
to
the
sullen
entomologist
is
this
of
any
use
to
you
the
amateur
lifted
it
up
carefully
and
having
almost
poked
it
into
his
eyes
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
bravo
hercules
you
are
making
amends
for
your
past
mischief
it
is
splendid
it
is
unique
is
it
really
very
curious
said
weldon
yes
indeed
answered
the
enraptured
naturalist
it
is
really
unique
it
belongs
to
neither
of
the
ten
orders
it
can
be
classed
neither
with
the
coleoptera
neuroptera
nor
to
the
hymenoptera
if
it
had
eight
legs
i
should
know
how
to
classify
it
i
should
place
it
amongst
the
second
section
of
the
arachnida
but
it
is
a
hexapod
a
genuine
hexapod
a
spider
with
six
legs
a
grand
discovery
it
must
be
entered
on
the
catalogue
as
benedictus
once
again
mounted
on
his
hobby
the
worthy
enthusiast
continued
to
discourse
with
an
unwonted
vivacity
to
his
indulgent
not
over
attentive
audience
meanwhile
the
canoe
was
steadily
threading
its
way
over
the
dark
waters
the
silence
of
the
night
broken
only
by
the
rattle
of
the
scales
of
some
crocodiles
or
by
the
snorting
of
hippopotamuses
in
the
neighbourhood
once
the
travellers
were
startled
by
a
loud
noise
such
as
might
proceed
from
some
ponderous
machinery
in
motion
it
was
caused
by
a
troop
of
a
hundred
or
more
elephants
that
after
feasting
through
the
day
on
the
roots
of
the
forest
had
come
to
quench
their
thirst
at
the
illustration
it
was
caused
by

or
more
elephants

no
danger
was
to
be
apprehended

pale
moon
that
rose
over

tall
trees
the
canoe
throughout
the
night
pursued
in
safety
its
solitary
voyage
chapter
xviii
an
anxious
voyage
thus
the
canoe
drifted
on
for
a
week
the
forests
that
for
many
miles
had
skirted
the
river
ultimately
giving
place
to
extensive
jungles
that
stretched
far
away
to
the
horizon
destitute
fortunately
for
the
travellers
of
human
inhabitants
the
district
abounded
in
a
large
variety
of
animal
life
zebras
elands
caamas
sported
on
the
bank
disappearing
at
before
howling
leopards
and
roaring
lions
it
was
dick
general
custom
as
he
lay
to
for
a
while
in
the
afternoon
to
go
ashore
in
search
of
food
and
as
the
manioc
maize
and
sorghum
that
were
to
be
found
were
of
a
wild
growth
and
consequently
not
fit
for
consumption
he
was
obliged
to
run
the
risk
of
using
his
gun
on
the
of
july
he
succeeded
by
a
single
shot
in
killing
a
kind
of
antelope
about
five
feet
long
with
annulated
horns
a
tawny
skin
dappled
with
bright
spots
and
a
white
belly
the
venison
proved
excellent
and
was
roasted
over
a
fire
procured
by
the
primitive
method
practised
it
is
said
even
by
gorillas
of
rubbing
two
sticks
together

halts

augmented
by
only
a
few
insignificant
tributaries
had
not
materially
increased
in
volume
its
direction
however
had
slightly
changed
more
to
the
it
afforded
a
very
fair
supply
of
fish
which
were
caught
by
lines
made
of
the
long
stems
of

stood
face
to
face
with
his
foe
next
day
dick
met
with
an
adventure
that
put
all
his
courage
and
composure
to
the
test
he
had
noticed
the
horns
of
a
caama
projecting
above
the
brushwood
and
went
ashore
alone
with
the
intention
of
securing
it
he
succeeded
in
getting
tolerably
close
to
it
and
fired
but
he
was
terribly
startled
when
a
formidable
creature
bounded
along
some
thirty
paces
ahead
and
took
possession
of
the
prey
he
had
just
wounded
it
was
a
majestic
lion
at
least
five
feet
in
height
of
the
kind
called
in
distinction
to
the
maneless
species
known
as

before
dick
had
time
to
reload
the
huge
brute
had
caught
sight
of
him
and
without
relaxing
its
hold
upon
the
writhing
antelope
beneath
its
claws
glared
upon
him
fiercely
dick
presence
of
mind
did
not
forsake
him
flight
he
knew
was
not
to
be
thought
of
his
only
chance
he
felt
intuitively
would
be
by
keeping
perfectly
still
and
aware
that
the
beast
would
be
unlikely
to
give
up
a
struggling
prey
for
another
that
was
motionless
he
stood
face
to
face
with
his
foe
not
venturing
to
move
an
eyelid
in
a
few
minutes
the
lion
patience
seemed
to
be
exhausted
with
a
grand
stateliness
it
picked
up
the
caama
as
easily
as
a
dog
would
lift
a
hare
turned
round
and
lashing
the
bushes
with
its
tail
disappeared
in
the
jungle
it
took
dick
some
little
time
to
recover
himself
sufficiently
to
return
to
the
canoe
on
arriving
he
said
nothing
of
the
peril
to
which
he
had
been
exposed
but
heartily
congratulated
himself
that
they
had
means
of
transport
without
making
their
way
through
jungles
and
forests
as
they
advanced
they
repeatedly
came
across
evidences
that
the
country
had
not
been
always
as
now
it
was
utterly
devoid
of
population
more
than
once
they
observed
traces
which
betokened
the
former
existence

villages

ruined
palisades
or
the
of
some
thatched
huts
or
some
solitary
sacred
tree
within
an
enclosure
would
indicate
that
the
death
of
a
chief
had
according
to
custom
made
a
native
tribe
migrate
to
new
quarters
if
natives
were
still
dwelling
in
the
district
as
was
just
probable
they
must
have
been
living
underground
only
emerging
at
night
like
beasts
of
prey
from
which
they
were
only
a
grade
removed
dick
sands
had
every
reason
to
feel
convinced
that
cannibalism
had
been
practised
in
the
neighbourhood
three
times
as
he
was
wandering
in
the
forest
he
had
come
upon
piles
of
ashes
and
human
bones
the
remnants
no
doubt
of
a
ghastly
meal
and
although
he
mentioned
nothing
of
what
he
had
seen
to
weldon
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
ashore
as
seldom
as
possible
and
as
often
as
he
found
it
absolutely
necessary
to
go
he
gave
hercules
strict
directions
to
push
off
into
at
the
very
first
intimation
of
danger
a
new
cause
of
anxiety
arose
on
the
following
evening
and
made
it
necessary
for
them
to
take
the
most
guarded
measures
of
precaution
the
had
widened
out
into
a
kind
of
lagoon
and
on
the
right
side
of
this
built
upon
piles
in
the
water
not
only
was
there
a
collection
of
about
thirty
huts
but
the
fires
gleaming
under
the
thatch
made
it
evident
that
they
were
all
inhabited
unfortunately
the
only
channel
of
the
stream
flowed
close
under
the
huts
the
river
elsewhere
being
so
obstructed
with
rocks
that
navigation
of
any
kind
was
impossible
nothing
was
more
probable
than
that
the
natives
would
have
set
their
nets
all
across
the
piles
and
if
so
the
canoe
would
be
sure
to
be
obstructed
and
an
alarm
must
inevitably
be
raised
every
caution
seemed
to
be
unavailing
because
the
canoe
must
follow
the
stream
however
in
the
lowest
of
whispers
dick
ordered
hercules
to
keep
clear
as
much
as
he
could
of
the
timber
the
night
was
not
very
dark
which
was
equally
an
advantage
and
a
disadvantage
as
while
it
permitted
those
on
board
to
steer
as
they
wanted
it
did
not
prevent
them
from
being
seen
the
situation
became
more
and
more
critical
about
a
hundred
feet
ahead
the
channel
was
very
contracted
two
natives
gesticulating
violently
were
seen
squatting
on
the
pilework
a
few
moments
more
and
their
voices
could
be
heard
it
was
obvious
that
they
had
seen
the
floating
mass
apprehending
that
it
was
going
to
destroy
their
nets
they
yelled
aloud
and
shouted
for
assistance
instantly
five
or
six
negroes
scrambled
down
the
piles
and
perched
themselves
upon
the
on
board
the
canoe
the
profoundest
silence
was
maintained
dick
only
signalled
his
directions
to
hercules
without
uttering
a
word
while
jack
performed
his
part
by
holding
dingo
mouth
tightly
closed
to
stop
the
low
growlings
which
the
faithful
seemed
resolved
to
make
but
fortunately
every
sound
was
overpowered
by
the
rushing
of
the
stream
and
the
clamour
of
the
negroes
as
they
hurriedly
drew
in
their
nets
if
they
should
raise
them
in
time
all
might
be
well
but
if
on
the
other
hand
the
canoe
should
get
entangled
the
consequences
could
hardly
fail
to
be
disastrous
the
current
in
its
narrow
channel
was
so
strong
that
dick
was
powerless
either
to
modify
his
course
or
to
slacken
it
half
a
minute
more
and
the
canoe
was
right
under
the
woodwork
but
the
efforts
of
the
natives
had
already
elevated
the
nets
so
that
the
anticipated
danger
was
happily
escaped
but
it
chanced
that
in
making
its
way
through
the
obstacle
a
large
piece
of
the
got
detached
one
of
the
negroes
raised
a
sudden
shout
of
alarm
and
it
seemed
only
too
probable
that
he
had
caught
a
sight
of
the
travellers
below
and
was
informing
his
companions
this
apprehension
too
was
only
momentary
the
current
had
changed
almost
to
a
rapid
and
carried
the
canoe
along
with
such
velocity
that
the
lacustrine
village
was
quickly
out
of
sight
steer
to
the
left
cried
dick
finding
that
the
riverbed
had
again
become
clear
a
stiff
pull
at
the
tiller
made
the
craft
fly
in
that
direction
dick
went
to
the
stern
and
scanned
the
moonlit
waters
all
was
perfectly
still
no
canoe
was
in
pursuit
perhaps
the
natives
had
not
one
to
use
but
certain
it
was
that
when
daylight
dawned
no
vestige
of
an
inhabitant
was
to
be
seen
nevertheless
dick
thought
it
prudent
for
a
while
to
steer
close
under
the
shelter
of
the
shore
illustration
instantly
five
or
six
negroes
scrambled
down
the
piles
by
the
end
of
the
next
four
days
the
aspect
of
the
country
had
undergone
a
remarkable
change
the
jungle
having
given
place
to
a
desert
as
dreary
as
the
kalahari
itself
the
river
appeared
interminable
and
it
became
a
matter
of
serious
consideration
how
to
get
a
sufficiency
of
food
fish
was
scarce
or
at
least
hard
to
catch
and
the
arid
soil
provided
no
means
of
sustenance
for
antelopes
so
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
from
the
chase
carnivorous
animals
also
had
quite
disappeared
and
the
silence
of
the
night
was
broken
not
by
the
roar
of
wild
beasts
but
by
the
croaking
of
frogs
in
a
discordant
chorus
which
cameron
has
compared
to
the
clanking
of
hammers
and
the
grating
of
files
in
a
yard
far
away
both
to
the
east
and
west
the
outlines
of
hills
could
be
faintly
discerned
but
the
shores
on
either
hand
were
perfectly
flat
and
devoid
of
trees
euphorbias
it
is
true
grew
in
considerable
numbers
but
as
they
were
only
of
the
species
and
not
the
kind
from
which
cassava
or
manioc
is
procured
they
were
useless
in
an
alimentary
point
of
view
dick
was
becoming
more
and
more
perplexed
when
hercules
happened
to
mention
that
the
natives
often
eat
young
and
the
pith
of
the
papyrus
and
that
before
now
he
had
himself
been
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
subsisting
on
nothing
better
we
must
try
them
said
dick
both
ferns
and
papyrus
abounded
on
the
banks
and
a
meal
was
prepared
the
sweet
soft
pith
of
the
papyrus
being
found
very
palatable
jack
in
particular
appeared
to
enjoy
it
extremely
but
it
was
not
in
any
way
a
satisfying
diet
thanks
to
cousin
benedict
a
fresh
variety
in
the
matter
of
food
was
found
on
the
following
day
since
the
discovery
of
the
hexapodes
benedictus
he
had
recovered
his
spirits
and
having
fastened
his
prize
safely
inside
his
hat
he
wandered
about
as
often
as
he
had
a
chance
in
his
favourite
pursuit
of
as
he
was
rummaging
in
the
long
grass
he
put
up
a
bird
which
flew
but
a
very
short
distance
benedict
recognized
it
by
its
peculiar
note
and
seeing
dick
take
his
gun
to
aim
at
it
exclaimed
do
fire
do
fire
that
bird
will
be
worth
nothing
for
food
among
five
of
us
it
will
be
dinner
enough
for
jack
said
dick
who
finding
that
the
bird
did
not
seem
in
a
hurry
to
make
its
escape
delayed
his
shot
for
a
moment
without
intending
to
be
diverted
from
his
purpose
of
securing
it
you
must
fire
insisted
benedict
it
is
an
indicator
it
will
show
you
where
there
are
lots
of
honey
aware
that
a
few
pounds
of
honey
would
really
be
of
more
value
than
a
little
bird
dick
lowered
his
gun
and
in
company
with
the
entomologist
set
off
to
follow
the
indicator
which
seemed
by
alternately
flying
and
stopping
to
be
inviting
them
to
come
on
and
they
had
but
a
little
way
to
go
before
they
observed
several
swarms
of
bees
buzzing
around
some
old
stems
hidden
amongst
the
euphorbias
notwithstanding
benedict
remonstrances
against
depriving
the
bees
of
the
fruits
of
their
industry
dick
instantly
set
to
work
and
without
remorse
suffocated
them
by
burning
dry
grass
underneath
having
secured
a
good
amount
of
honey
he
left
the
comb
to
the
indicator
as
its
share
of
the
booty
and
went
back
with
his
companion
to
the
canoe
the
honey
was
acceptable
but
it
did
not
do
much
to
alleviate
the
cravings
of
hunger
next
day
it
happened
that
they
had
just
stopped
for
their
accustomed
rest
when
they
observed
that
an
enormous
swarm
of
grasshoppers
had
settled
at
the
mouth
of
a
creek
close
by
two
or
three
deep
they
covered
the
soil
myriads
and
myriads
of
them
adhering
to
every
shrub
the
natives
eat
those
grasshoppers
said
benedict
and
like
them
too
the
remark
produced
an
instant
effect
all
hands
were
busied
in
collecting
them
and
a
large
supply
was
quickly
gathered
the
canoe
might
have
been
filled
ten
times
over
grilled
over
a
slow
fire
they
were
found
to
be
very
palatable
eating
and
spite
of
his
qualms
of
conscience
benedict
himself
made
a
hearty
meal
but
although
the
gnawings
of
absolute
hunger
were
thus
assuaged
all
the
travellers
began
to
long
most
anxiously
for
the
voyage
to
come
to
an
end
the
mode
of
transit
indeed
might
be
less
exhausting
to
the
bodily
powers
than
a
land
march
would
have
been
but
the
excessive
heat
by
day
the
damp
mists
at
night
and
the
incessant
attacks
of
mosquitoes
all
combined
to
render
the
passage
extremely
trying
there
was
no
telling
how
long
it
would
last
and
dick
was
equally
uncertain
whether
it
might
end
in
a
few
days
or
be
protracted
for
a
month
the
direction
which
the
stream
was
taking
was
itself
a
subject
of
perplexity
a
fresh
surprise
was
now
in
store
as
jack
a
few
mornings
afterwards
was
standing
at
the
bow
peering
through
an
aperture
in
the
grass
canopy
above
him
he
suddenly
turned
round
and
cried
the
sea
the
sea
dick
started
forwards
and
looked
eagerly
in
the
same
direction
a
large
expanse
of
water
was
visible
in
the
horizon
but
after
having
surveyed
it
for
a
moment
or
two
he
said
no
jack
it
is
not
the
sea
it
is
a
great
river
it
is
running
west
and
i
suppose
this
river
runs
into
it
perhaps
it
is
the
zaire
let
us
hope
it
is
said
weldon
earnestly
most
cordially
did
dick
sands
her
words
being
well
aware
that
at
the
mouth
of
that
river
were
portuguese
villages
where
a
refuge
might
assuredly
be
found
for
several
succeeding
days
the
canoe
still
concealed
by
its
covering
floated
on
the
silvery
surface
of
this
stream
on
either
side
the
banks
became
less
arid
and
there
seemed
everything
to
encourage
the
few
survivors
of
the
pilgrim
to
believe
that
they
would
soon
see
the
last
of
the
perils
and
toils
of
their
journey
they
were
too
sanguine
towards
three
on
the
morning
of
the
dick
who
was
at
his
usual
post
at
the
bow
fancied
he
heard
a
dull
rumbling
towards
the
west
weldon
jack
and
benedict
were
all
asleep
calling
hercules
to
him
he
asked
him
whether
he
could
not
hear
a
strange
noise
the
night
was
perfectly
calm
and
not
a
breath
of
air
was
stirring
the
negro
listened
attentively
and
suddenly
his
eyes
sparkling
with
delight
exclaimed
yes
captain
i
hear
the
sea
dick
shook
his
head
and
answered
it
is
not
the
sea
hercules
not
the
sea
cried
the
negro
then
what
can
it
be
we
must
wait
till
daybreak
replied
dick
and
meanwhile
we
shall
have
to
keep
a
sharp
hercules
returned
to
his
place
but
only
to
continue
listening
with
curiosity
the
rumbling
perceptibly
increased
till
it
became
a
continued
roar
with
scarcely
any
intervening
twilight
night
passed
into
day
just
in
front
scarcely
more
than
half
a
mile
ahead
a
great
mist
was
hanging
over
the
river
it
was
not
an
ordinary
fog
and
when
the
sun
rose
the
light
of
the
dawn
caused
a
brilliant
rainbow
to
arch
itself
from
shore
to
shore
in
a
voice
so
loud
that
it
awoke
weldon
dick
gave
his
order
to
hercules
to
steer
for
the
bank
quick
quick
hercules
ashore
ashore
there
are
cataracts
close
ahead
and
so
it
was
within
little
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
bed
of
the
river
sank
abruptly
some
hundred
feet
and
the
foaming
waters
rushed
down
in
a
magnificent
fall
with
irresistible
velocity
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
canoe
must
have
been
swallowed
in
the
deep
abyss
chapter
xix
an
attack
the
canoe
inclined
to
the
west
readily
enough
the
fall
in
the
was
so
sudden
that
the
current
remained
quite
unaffected
by
the
cataract
at
a
distance
of
three
hundred
yards
on
the
bank
were
woods
so
dense
that
sunlight
could
not
penetrate
the
shade
dick
was
conscious
of
a
sad
misgiving
when
he
looked
at
the
character
of
the
territory
through
which
they
must
necessarily
pass
it
did
not
seem
practicable
by
any
means
to
convey
the
canoe
below
the
falls
as
they
neared
the
shore
dingo
became
intensely
agitated
at
first
dick
suspected
that
a
wild
beast
or
a
native
might
be
lurking
in
the
papyrus
but
it
soon
became
obvious
that
the
dog
was
excited
by
grief
rather
than
by
rage
dingo
is
crying
said
jack
poor
dingo
and
the
child
laid
his
arms
over
the
creature
neck
the
dog
however
was
too
impatient
to
be
caressed
bounding
away
he
sprang
into
the
water
swam
across
the
twenty
feet
that
intervened
between
the
shore
and
disappeared
in
the
grass
in
a
few
moments
the
boat
had
glided
on
to
a
carpet
of
confervas
and
other
aquatic
plants
starting
a
few
kingfishers
and
some
herons
hercules
moored
it
to
the
stump
of
a
tree
and
the
travellers
went
ashore
there
was
no
pathway
through
the
forest
only
the
trampled
moss
showed
that
the
place
had
been
recently
visited
either
by
animals
or
men
illustration
upon
the
smooth
wood
were
two
great
letters
in
dingy
red
dick
took
his
gun
and
hercules
his
hatchet
and
they
set
out
to
search
for
dingo
they
had
not
far
to
go
before
they
saw
him
with
his
nose
close
to
the
ground
manifestly
following
a
scent
the
animal
raised
his
head
for
a
moment
as
if
beckoning
them
to
follow
and
kept
on
till
he
reached
an
old
having
called
out
to
the
rest
of
the
party
to
join
them
dick
made
his
way
farther
into
the
wood
till
he
got
up
to
dingo
who
was
whining
piteously
at
the
entrance
of
a
dilapidated
hut
the
rest
were
not
long
in
following
and
they
all
entered
the
hut
together
the
floor
was
strewn
with
bones
whitened
by
exposure
some
one
has
died
here
said
weldon
perhaps
added
dick
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
it
was
dingo
old
master
look
at
him
he
is
pointing
with
his
paw
the
portion
of
the
which
formed
the
farther
side
of
the
hut
had
been
stripped
of
its
bark
and
upon
the
smooth
wood
were
two
great
letters
in
dingy
red
almost
effaced
by
time
but
yet
plain
enough
to
be
distinguished
cried
dick
as
he
looked
where
the
dog
paw
rested
the
same
initials
that
dingo
has
upon
his
collar
there
can
be
no
mistake
a
small
copper
box
green
with
verdigris
caught
his
eye
and
he
picked
it
up
it
was
open
but
contained
a
scrap
of
discoloured
paper
the
writing
upon
this
consisted
of
a
few
sentences
of
which
only
detached
words
could
be
made
out
but
they
revealed
the
sad
truth
only
too
plainly

the
clue
to
a
melancholy
story
samuel
vernon
under
the
guidance
of
negoro
and
taking
with
him
his
dog
dingo
had
set
out
on
an
exploration
of
a
district
of
central
africa
he
had
taken
a
considerable
quantity
of
money
to
procure
the
necessary
supplies
on
the
way
and
this
had
excited
the
cupidity
of
his
guide
who
seized
the
opportunity
whilst
they
were
encamping
on
the
banks
of
the
congo
to
assassinate
his
employer
and
get
possession
of

the
hands
of
the
portuguese
by
whom
he
was
recognized
as
an
agent
of
the
alvez
and
condemned
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
in
prison
he
contrived
after
a
while
to
make
his
escape
and
as
has
been
already
mentioned
found
his
way
to
new
zealand
whence
he
had
returned
by
securing
an
engagement
on
board
the
pilgrim
between
the
time
when
he
was
attacked
by
negoro
and
the
moment
of
his
death
vernon
had
managed
to
write
the
few
brief
lines
of
which
the
fragments
still
survived
and
to
deposit
the
document
in
the
box
from
which
the
money
had
been
stolen
and
by
a
last
effort
had
traced
out
his
initials
in
blood
upon
the
naked
wood
which
formed
the
wall
of
the
hut
for
many
days
dingo
watched
beside
his
master
and
throughout
that
time
his
eyes
were
resting
so
perpetually
upon
the
two
crimson
letters
in
front
of
him
that
mere
instinct
seemed
to
fasten
them
indelibly
on
his
memory
quitting
his
watch
one
day
perhaps
to
pacify
his
hunger
the
dog
wandered
to
the
coast
where
he
was
picked
up
by
the
captain
of
the
waldeck
afterwards
to
be
transferred
to
the
very
ship
on
which
his
owner
murderer
had
been
engaged
as
cook
all
throughout
this
time
poor
vernon
bones
had
been
bleaching
in
the
african
forest
and
the
first
resolution
of
dick
and
weldon
was
to
give
the
residue
of
his
remains
some
semblance
of
a
decent
burial
they
were
just
proceeding
to
their
task
when
dingo
gave
a
furious
growl
and
dashed
out
of
the
hut
another
moment
and
a
terrible
shriek
made
it
evident
that
he
was
in
conflict
with
some
dread
antagonist
hercules
was
quickly
in
pursuit
and
the
whole
party
followed
in
time
to
witness
the
giant
hurl
himself
upon
a
man
with
whom
already
dingo
was
in
mortal
combat
illustration
the
dog
was
griping
the
man
by
the
throat
the
dog
was
griping
the
man
by
the
throat
the
man
was
lifting
his
cutlass
high
above
the
head
of
the
dog
that
man
was
negoro
the
rascal
on
getting
his
letter
at
kazonndé
instead
of
embarking
at
once
for
america
had
left
his
native
escort
for
a
while
and
returned
to
the
scene
of
his
crime
to
secure
the
treasure
which
he
had
left
buried
at
a
little
distance
in
a
spot
that
he
had
marked
at
this
very
moment
he
was
in
the
act
of
digging
up
the
gold
he
had
concealed
some
glistening
coins
scattered
here
and
there
betrayed
his
purpose
but
in
the
midst
of
his
labours
he
had
been
startled
by
the
dashing
forward
of
a
dog
another
instant
and
the
dog
had
fixed
itself
upon
his
throat
whilst
he
in
an
agony
of
desperation
had
drawn
his
cutlass
and
plunged
it
deep
into
the
creature
side
hercules
came
up
at
the
very
climax
of
the
you
villain
you
accursed
villain
i
have
you
now
he
cried
about
to
seize
hold
of
his
victim
but
vengeance
was
already
accomplished
negoro
gave
no
sign
of
life
death
had
overtaken
him
on
the
very
scene
of
his
guilt
dingo
too
had
received
a
mortal
wound
he
dragged
himself
back
to
the
hut
lay
down
beside
the
remains
of
his
master
and
expired
the
sad
task
of
burying
vernon
bones
and
laying
his
faithful
dog
beside
them
having
been
accomplished
the
whole
party
was
obliged
to
turn
their
thoughts
to
their
own
safety
although
negoro
was
dead
it
as
very
likely
that
the
natives
that
he
had
taken
with
him
were
at
no
great
distance
and
would
come
to
search
for
him
a
hurried
conference
was
held
as
to
what
steps
had
best
be
taken
the
few
words
traceable
on
the
paper
made
them
aware
that
they
were
on
the
banks
of
the
congo
and
that
they
were
still
miles
from
the
coast
the
fall
just
ahead
was
probably
the
cataract
of
memo
but
whatever
it
was
no
doubt
it
effectually
barred
their
farther
progress
by
water
there
seemed
no
alternative
but
that
they
should
make
their
way
by
one
bank
or
the
other
a
mile
or
two
below
the
waterfall
and
there
construct
a
raft
on
which
once
again
they
could
drift
down
the
stream
the
question
that
pressed
for
immediate
settlement
was
which
bank
it
should
be
here
on
the
left
bank
would
be
the
greater
risk
of
encountering
the
negro
escort
of
negoro
while
as
to
the
farther
shore
they
could
not
tell
what
obstacles
it
might
present
altogether
weldon
advocated
trying
the
other
side
but
dick
insisted
upon
crossing
first
by
himself
to
ascertain
whether
an
advance
by
that
route
were
really
practicable
the
river
is
only
about
yards
wide
he
urged
i
can
soon
get
across
i
shall
leave
hercules
to
look
after
you
all
weldon
demurred
for
a
while
but
dick
seemed
resolute
and
as
he
promised
to
take
his
gun
and
not
to
attempt
to
land
if
he
saw
the
least
symptom
of
danger
she
at
last
consented
but
with
so
much
reluctance
that
even
after
he
had
entered
the
canoe
she
said
i
think
dick
it
would
be
really
better
for
us
all
to
go
together
no
weldon
indeed
no
i
am
sure
it
is
best
for
me
to
go
alone
i
shall
be
back
in
an
hour
if
it
must
be
so
it
must
said
the
lady
keep
a
sharp
hercules
cried
the
youth
cheerily
as
he
pushed
off
from
the
land
the
strength
of
the
current
was
by
no
means
violent
but
quite
enough
to
make
the
direction
of
dick
course
somewhat
oblique
the
roar
of
the
cataract
reverberated
in
his
ears
and
the
spray
wafted
by
the
westerly
wind
brushed
lightly
past
his
face
and
he
shuddered
as
he
felt
how
near
they
must
have
been
to
destruction
if
he
had
relaxed
his
watch
throughout
the
night
it
took
him
hardly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
reach
the
opposite
bank
and
he
was
just
preparing
to
land
when
there
arose
a
tremendous
shout
from
about
a
dozen
natives
who
rushing
forward
began
to
tear
away
the
canopy
of
grass
with
which
the
canoe
was
covered
dick
horror
was
great
it
would
have
been
greater
still
if
he
had
known
that
they
were
cannibals
they
were
the
natives
settled
at
the
lacustrine
village
higher
up
the
river
when
the
piece
of
thatch
had
been
knocked
off
in
passing
the
piles
a
glimpse
had
been
caught
of
the
passengers
below
and
aware
that
the
cataract
ahead
must
ultimately
bring
them
to
a
standstill
the
eager
barbarians
had
followed
them
persistently
day
by
day
for
the
last
eight
days
now
they
thought
they
had
secured
their
prize
but
loud
was
their
yell
of
disappointment
when
on
stripping
off
the
thatch
they
found
only
one
person
and
that
a
mere
boy
standing
beneath
it
dick
stood
as
calmly
as
he
could
at
the
bow
and
pointed
his
gun
towards
the
savages
who
were
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
to
make
them
afraid
to
attack
him
weldon
with
the
others
in
their
eagerness
to
watch
movements
had
remained
standing
upon
the
shore
of
the
river
and
at
this
instant
were
caught
sight
of
by
one
of
the
natives
who
pointed
them
out
to
his
companions
a
sudden
impulse
seized
the
whole
of
them
and
they
sprang
into
the
canoe
there
seemed
to
be
a
practised
hand
amongst
them
which
caught
hold
of
the
and
the
little
craft
was
quickly
on
its
way
back
although
he
gave
up
all
as
now
lost
dick
neither
moved
nor
spoke
he
had
one
lingering
hope
yet
left
was
it
not
possible
even
now
that
by
sacrificing
his
own
life
he
could
save
the
lives
of
those
that
were
entrusted
to
him
when
the
canoe
had
come
near
enough
to
the
shore
for
his
voice
to
be
heard
he
shouted
with
all
his
might
fly
weldon
fly
all
of
you
fly
for
your
lives
but
neither
weldon
nor
hercules
stirred
they
seemed
rooted
to
the
ground
fly
fly
fly
he
continued
shouting
but
though
he
knew
they
must
hear
him
yet
he
saw
them
make
no
effort
to
escape
he
understood
their
meaning
of
what
avail
was
flight
when
the
savages
would
be
upon
their
track
in
a
few
minutes
after
a
sudden
thought
crossed
his
mind
he
raised
his
gun
and
fired
at
the
man
who
was
steering
the
bullet
shattered
the
into
fragments
the
cannibals
uttered
a
yell
of
terror
deprived
of
guidance
the
canoe
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
current
and
borne
along
with
increasing
speed
was
soon
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
cataract
the
anxious
watchers
on
the
bank
instantly
discerned
dick
purpose
and
understood
that
in
order
to
save
them
he
had
formed
the
resolution
of
precipitating
himself
with
the
savages
into
the
seething
waters
nothing
could
avail
to
arrest
the
swift
descent

paralyzed
whilst

involuntarily
extended
his
great
strong
arm

was
powerless
to
aid

by
a

frantic
effort

into

presence

mind
might
not
that
light
canoe
floating
bottom
upwards
be
made
the
means
for
yet
another
grasp
at
life
the
danger
that
threatened
him
was
twofold
there
was
the
risk
of
suffocation
as
well
as
the
peril
of
being
drowned
could
not
the
inverted
canoe
be
used
for
a
kind
of
float
at
once
to
keep
his
head
above
water
and
to
serve
as
a
screen
from
the
rushing
air

had
some
faint
recollection
of
how
it
had
been
proved
possible
under
some
such
conditions
to
descend
in
safety
the
falls
of
niagara
quick
as
lightning
he
seized
hold
of
the
of
the
canoe
and
with
his
head
out
of
water
beneath
the
upturned
keel
he
was
dashed
down
the
furious
and
perpendicular
fall
the
craft
sank
deep
into
the
abyss
but
rose
quickly
again
to
the
surface
here
was
dick
chance
he
was
a
good
swimmer
and
his
life
depended
now
upon
his
strength
of

it
was
a
hard
struggle
but
he
succeeded
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
had
landed
on
the
left
hand

where
he
was
greeted
with
the
joyful
congratulations
of

assure
themselves
of

chapter
xx
a
happy
reunion
two
days
after
dick
marvellous
deliverance
the
party
had
the
good
fortune
to
fall
in
with
a
caravan
of
honest
portuguese
on
their
way
to
emboma
at
the
mouth
of
the
congo
they
rendered
the
fugitives
every
assistance
and
thus
enabled
them
to
reach
the
coast
without
further
discomfort
this
meeting
with
the
caravan
was
a
most
fortunate
occurrence
as
any
project
of
launching
a
raft
upon
the
zaire
would
have
been
quite
impracticable
the
river
between
the
ntemo
and
yellala
falls
being
a
continuous
series
of
cataracts
stanley
counted
as
many
as
and
it
was
hereabouts
that
that
brave
traveller
sustained
the
last
of
conflicts
with
the
natives
escaping
almost
by
a
miracle
from
the
mbelo
cataract
before
the
middle
of
august
the
party
arrived
at
emboma
where
they
were
hospitably
received
by
motta
viega
and
harrison
a
steamer
was
just
on
the
point
of
starting
for
the
isthmus
of
panama
in
this
they
took
their
passage
and
in
due
time
set
foot
once
more
upon
american
soil
forthwith
a
message
was
despatched
to
weldon
apprising
him
of
the
return
of
the
wife
and
child
over
whose
loss
he
had
mourned
so
long
on
the
the
railroad
deposited
the
travellers
at
san
francisco
the
only
thing
to
mar
their
happiness
being
the
recollection
that
tom
and
his
partners
were
not
with
them
to
share
their
joy
weldon
had
every
reason
to
congratulate
himself
that
negoro
had
failed
to
reach
him
no
doubt
he
would
have
been
ready
to
sacrifice
the
bulk
of
his
fortune
and
without
a
moment
hesitation
would
have
set
out
for
the
coast
of
africa
but
who
could
question
that
he
would
there
have
been
exposed
to
the
vilest
treachery
he
felt
that
to
dick
sands
and
to
hercules
he
owed
a
debt
of
gratitude
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
repay
dick
assumed
more
than
ever
the
place
of
an
adopted
son
whilst
the
brave
negro
was
regarded
as
a
true
and
faithful
friend
cousin
benedict
it
must
be
owned
failed
to
share
for
long
the
general
joy
after
giving
weldon
a
hasty
shake
of
the
hand
he
hurried
off
to
his
private
room
and
resumed
his
studies
almost
as
if
they
had
never
been
interrupted
he
set
himself
vigorously
to
work
with
the
design
of
producing
an
elaborate
treatise
upon
the
hexapodes
benedictus
hitherto
unknown
to
entomological
research
here
in
his
private
chamber
spectacles
and
were
ready
for
his
use
and
he
was
now
able
for
the
first
time
with
the
aid
of
proper
appliances
to
examine
the
unique
production
of
central
africa
a
shriek
of
horror
and
disappointment
escaped
his
lips
the
hexapodes
benedictus
was
not
a
hexapod
at
all
it
was
a
common
spider
hercules
in
catching
it
had
unfortunately
broken
off
its
two
front
legs
and
benedict
almost
blind
as
he
was
had
failed
to
detect
the
accident
his
chagrin
was
most
pitiable
the
wonderful
discovery
that
was
to
have
exalted
his
name
high
in
the
annals
of
science
belonged
simply
to
the
common
order
of
the
arachnidæ
the
blow
to
his
aspirations
was
very
heavy
it
brought
on
a
fit
of
illness
from
which
it
took
him
some
time
to
recover
for
the
next
three
years
dick
was
entrusted
with
the
education
of
little
jack
during
the
intervals
he
could
spare
from
the
prosecution
of
his
own
studies
into
which
he
threw
himself
with
an
energy
quickened
by
a
kind
of
remorse
if
only
i
had
known
what
a
seaman
ought
to
know
when
i
was
left
to
myself
on
board
the
he
would
continually
say
what
misery
and
suffering
we
might
have
been
spared
so
diligently
did
he
apply
himself
to
the
technical
branches
of
his
profession
that
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
received
a
special
certificate
of
honour
and
was
at
once
raised
to
the
rank
of
a
captain
in
weldon
firm
thus
by
his
industry
and
good
conduct
did
the
poor
foundling
of
sandy
hook
rise
to
a
post
of
distinction
in
spite
of
his
youth
he
commanded
universal
respect
his
native
modesty
and
straightforwardness
never
failed
him
and
for
his
own
part
he
seemed
to
be
unconscious
of
those
fine
traits
in
his
character
which
had
impelled
him
to
deeds
that
made
him
little
short
of
a
hero
his
leisure
moments
however
were
often
troubled
by
one
source
of
sadness
he
could
never
forget
the
four
negroes
for
whose
misfortunes
he
held
himself
by
his
own
inexperience
to
be
in
a
way
responsible
weldon
thoroughly
shared
his
regret
and
would
have
made
many
sacrifices
to
discover
what
had
become
of
them
this
anxiety
was
at
length
relieved
owing
to
the
large
correspondence
of
weldon
in
almost
every
quarter
of
the
world
it
was
discovered
that
the
whole
of
them
had
been
sold
in
one
lot
and
that
they
were
now
in
madagascar
without
listening
for
a
moment
to
dick
proposal
to
apply
all
his
savings
to
effect
their
liberation
weldon
set
his
own
agents
to
negotiate
for
their
freedom
and
on
the
of
november
tom
bat
actæon
and
austin
awaited
their
welcome
at
the
merchant
door
it
is
needless
to
say
how
warm
were
the
greetings
they
