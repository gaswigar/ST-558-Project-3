preface
three
years
ago
i
published
under
the
title
a
ten
years
war
a
series
of
papers
intended
to
account
for
the
battle
with
the
slum
since
i
wrote
how
the
other
half
lives
a
good
many
things
can
happen
in
three
years
so
many
things
have
happened
in
these
three
the
fighting
has
been
so
general
all
along
the
line
and
has
so
held
public
attention
that
this
seems
the
proper
time
to
pass
it
all
in
review
once
more
that
i
have
tried
to
do
in
this
book
retaining
all
that
still
applied
of
the
old
volume
and
adding
as
much
more
the
stories
were
printed
in
the
they
are
fact
not
fiction
if
the
latter
they
would
have
no
place
here
the
battle
with
the
slum
is
properly
the
sequel
to
how
the
other
half
lives
and
tells
how
far
we
have
come
and
how
with
his
usual
hopefulness
i
read
in
the
annals
of
the
american
academy
of
political
and
social
science
of
my
book
three
years
ago
the
author
is
still
looking
forward
to
better
things
in
the
future
i
was
not
deceived
then
not
in
the
thirty
years
before
did
we
advance
as
in
these
three
though
tammany
blocked
the
way
most
of
the
time
it
is
great
to
have
lived
in
a
day
that
sees
such
things
done

the
battle
with
the
slum
what
the
fight
is
about
the
slum
is
as
old
as
civilization
civilization
implies
a
race
to
get
ahead
in
a
race
there
are
usually
some
who
for
one
cause
or
another
can
not
keep
up
or
are
thrust
out
from
among
their
fellows
they
fall
behind
and
when
they
have
been
left
far
in
the
rear
they
lose
hope
and
ambition
and
give
up
thenceforward
if
left
to
their
own
resources
they
are
the
victims
not
the
masters
of
their
environment
and
it
is
a
bad
master
they
drag
one
another
always
farther
down
the
bad
environment
becomes
the
heredity
of
the
next
generation
then
given
the
crowd
you
have
the
slum
the
battle
with
the
slum
began
the
day
civilization
recognized
in
it
her
enemy
it
was
a
losing
fight
until
conscience
joined
forces
with
fear
and
against
it
when
common
sense
and
the
golden
rule
obtain
among
men
as
a
rule
of
practice
it
will
be
over
the
two
have
not
always
been
classed
together
but
here
they
are
plainly
seen
to
belong
together
justice
to
the
individual
is
accepted
in
theory
as
the
only
safe
groundwork
of
the
commonwealth
when
it
is
practised
in
dealing
with
the
slum
there
will
shortly
be
no
slum
we
need
not
wait
for
the
millennium
to
get
rid
of
it
we
can
do
it
now
all
that
is
required
is
that
it
shall
not
be
left
to
itself
that
is
justice
to
it
and
to
us
since
its
grievous
ailment
is
that
it
can
not
help
itself
when
a
man
is
drowning
the
thing
to
do
is
to
pull
him
out
of
the
water
afterward
there
will
be
time
for
talking
it
over
we
got
at
it
the
other
way
in
dealing
with
our
social
problems
the
wise
men
had
their
day
and
they
decided
to
let
bad
enough
alone
that
it
was
unsafe
to
interfere
with
causes
that
operate
sociologically
as
one
survivor
of
these
unfittest
put
it
to
me
it
was
a
piece
of
scientific
humbug
that
cost
the
age
which
listened
to
it
dear
causes
that
operate
sociologically
are
the
opportunity
of
the
political
and
every
other
kind
of
scamp
who
trades
upon
the
depravity
and
helplessness
of
the
slum
and
the
refuge
of
the
pessimist
who
is
useless
in
the
fight
against
them
we
have
not
done
yet
paying
the
bills
he
ran
up
for
us
some
time
since
we
turned
to
to
pull
the
drowning
man
out
and
it
was
time
a
little
while
longer
and
we
should
hardly
have
escaped
being
dragged
down
with
him
the
slum
complaint
had
been
chronic
in
all
ages
but
the
great
changes
which
the
nineteenth
century
saw
the
new
industry
political
freedom
brought
on
an
acute
attack
which
put
that
very
freedom
in
jeopardy
too
many
of
us
had
supposed
that
built
as
our
commonwealth
was
on
universal
suffrage
it
would
be
proof
against
the
complaints
that
harassed
older
states
but
in
fact
it
turned
out
that
there
was
extra
hazard
in
that
having
solemnly
resolved
that
all
men
are
created
equal
and
have
certain
inalienable
rights
among
them
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
we
shut
our
eyes
and
waited
for
the
formula
to
work
it
was
as
if
a
man
with
a
cold
should
take
the
doctor
prescription
to
bed
with
him
expecting
it
to
cure
him
the
formula
was
all
right
but
merely
repeating
it
worked
no
cure
when
after
a
hundred
years
we
opened
our
eyes
it
was
upon
sixty
cents
a
day
as
the
living
wage
of
the
in
our
cities
upon
knee
pants
at
forty
cents
a
dozen
for
the
making
upon
the
potter
field
taking
tithe
of
our
city
life
ten
per
cent
each
year
for
the
trench
truly
the
lost
tenth
of
the
slum
our
country
had
grown
great
and
rich
through
our
ports
was
poured
food
for
the
millions
of
europe
but
in
the
back
streets
multitudes
huddled
in
ignorance
and
want
the
foreign
oppressor
had
been
vanquished
the
fetters
stricken
from
the
black
man
at
home
but
his
white
brother
in
his
bitter
plight
sent
up
a
cry
of
distress
that
had
in
it
a
distinct
note
of
menace
political
freedom
we
had
won
but
the
problem
of
helpless
poverty
grown
vast
with
the
added
offscourings
of
the
old
world
mocked
us
unsolved
liberty
at
sixty
cents
a
day
set
presently
its
stamp
upon
the
government
of
our
cities
and
it
became
the
scandal
and
the
peril
of
our
political
system
so
the
battle
began
three
times
since
the
war
that
absorbed
the
nation
energies
and
attention
had
the
slum
confronted
us
in
new
york
with
its
challenge
in
the
darkest
days
of
the
great
struggle
it
was
the
treacherous
mob
later
on
the
threat
of
the
cholera
which
found
swine
foraging
in
the
streets
as
the
only
scavengers
and
a
swarming
host
but
little
above
the
hog
in
its
appetites
and
in
the
quality
of
the
shelter
afforded
it
peopling
the
back
alleys
still
later
the
mob
caught
looting
the
city
treasury
with
its
idol
the
thief
tweed
at
its
head
drunk
with
power
and
plunder
had
insolently
defied
the
outraged
community
to
do
its
worst
there
were
meetings
and
protests
the
rascals
were
turned
out
for
a
season
the
died
in
jail
i
see
him
now
going
through
the
gloomy
portals
of
the
tombs
whither
as
a
newspaper
reporter
i
had
gone
with
him
his
stubborn
head
held
high
as
ever
i
asked
myself
more
than
once
at
the
time
when
the
vile
prison
was
torn
down
whether
the
comic
clamor
to
have
the
ugly
old
gates
preserved
and
set
up
in
central
park
had
anything
to
do
with
the
memory
of
the
martyred
thief
or
whether
it
was
in
joyful
celebration
of
the
fact
that
others
had
escaped
his
name
is
even
now
one
to
conjure
with
in
the
sixth
ward
he
never
squealed
and
he
was
so
good
to
the
poor
evidence
that
the
slum
is
not
laid
by
the
heels
by
merely
destroying
five
points
and
the
mulberry
bend
there
are
other
fights
to
be
fought
in
that
war
other
victories
to
be
won
and
it
is
slow
work
it
was
nearly
ten
years
after
the
great
robbery
before
decency
got
a
good
upper
grip
that
was
when
the
civic
conscience
awoke
in
footnote
the
draft
riots
of
and
after
all
that
the
lexow
disclosures
of
inconceivable
rottenness
of
a
tammany
police
the
woe
unto
you
of
christian
priests
calling
vainly
upon
the
chief
of
the
city
to
save
its
children
from
a
living
hell
and
the
contemptuous
reply
on
the
of
the
head
of
the
party
of
organized
robbery
at
the
door
of
which
it
was
all
laid
that
he
was
in
politics
working
for
his
own
pocket
all
the
time
same
as
you
and
everybody
else
slow
work
yes
but
be
it
ever
so
slow
the
battle
has
got
to
be
fought
and
fought
out
for
it
is
one
thing
or
the
other
either
we
wipe
out
the
slum
or
it
wipes
out
us
let
there
be
no
mistake
about
this
it
can
not
be
shirked
shirking
means
surrender
and
surrender
means
the
end
of
government
by
the
people
if
any
one
believes
this
to
be
needless
alarm
let
him
think
a
moment
government
by
the
people
must
ever
rest
upon
the
people
ability
to
govern
themselves
upon
their
intelligence
and
public
spirit
the
slum
stands
for
ignorance
want
unfitness
for
in
the
day
of
wrath
this
at
one
end
at
the
other
indifference
greed
it
is
human
nature
we
are
brothers
whether
we
own
it
or
not
and
when
the
brotherhood
is
denied
in
mulberry
street
we
shall
look
vainly
for
the
virtue
of
good
citizenship
on
fifth
avenue
when
the
slum
flourishes
unchallenged
in
the
cities
their
wharves
may
indeed
be
busy
their
filled
wealth
and
want
go
so
together
but
patriotism
among
their
people
is
dead
as
long
ago
as
the
very
beginning
of
our
republic
its
founders
saw
that
the
cities
were
in
their
plan
in
them
was
the
peril
of
democratic
government
at
that
time
scarce
one
in
of
the
people
in
the
united
states
lived
in
a
city
now
it
is
one
in
three
and
to
the
selfishness
of
the
trader
has
been
added
the
threat
of
the
slum
ask
yourself
then
how
long
before
it
would
make
an
end
of
us
if
let
alone
put
it
this
way
you
can
not
let
men
live
like
pigs
when
you
need
their
votes
as
freemen
it
is
not
safe
you
can
not
rob
a
child
of
its
childhood
of
its
home
its
play
its
freedom
from
toil
and
care
and
expect
to
appeal
to
the
voter
manhood
the
children
are
our
and
as
we
mould
them
so
will
they
deal
with
us
then
therefore
that
is
not
safe
unsafest
of
all
is
any
thing
or
deed
that
strikes
at
the
home
for
from
the
people
home
proceeds
citizen
virtue
and
nowhere
else
does
it
live
the
slum
is
the
enemy
of
the
home
because
of
it
the
chief
city
of
our
land
came
long
ago
to
be
called
the
homeless
city
when
this
people
comes
to
be
truly
called
a
nation
without
homes
there
will
no
longer
be
any
nation
footnote
the
experiment
has
been
long
tried
on
a
large
scale
with
a
dreadful
success
affording
the
demonstration
that
if
from
early
infancy
you
allow
human
beings
to
like
brutes
you
can
degrade
them
down
to
their
level
leaving
them
scarcely
more
intellect
and
no
feelings
and
affections
proper
to
human
hearts
on
the
health
of
british
hence
i
say
in
the
battle
with
the
slum
we
win
or
we
perish
there
is
no
middle
way
we
shall
win
for
we
are
not
letting
things
be
the
way
our
fathers
did
but
it
will
be
a
running
fight
and
it
is
not
going
to
be
won
in
two
years
or
in
ten
or
in
twenty
for
all
that
we
must
keep
on
fighting
content
if
in
our
time
we
avert
the
punishment
that
waits
upon
the
third
and
the
fourth
generation
of
those
who
forget
the
brotherhood
as
a

escape

as

i
could

brood
there
perhaps
over
the
fate
which
sowed
desolation
in

that
another
might
reap
wealth
and

that
last
might
not
be

it
is
a

described

died
there
like
flies
in
all
seasons
and
a
tenth
of
its
population
was
always
in

i
knew
the
story
of
how
it
had
been
built
by
a
quaker
with
good
intentions
but
without
good
sense
for
the
purpose
of
rescuing
people
from
the
awful
they
burrowed
in
around
there
this
within
years
of
the
death
of
george
washington
who
lived
just
across
the
street
on
the
crest
of
cherry
hill
when
he
was
president
and
how
in
a
score
of
years
from
the
time
it
was
built
it
had
come
to
earn
the
official
description
a
nuisance
which
from
its
very
magnitude
is
assumed
to
be
unremovable
and
irremediable
that
was
at
that
time
but
i
have
lived
to
see
it
taken
in
hand
three
times
once
by
the
landlord
under
compulsion
of
the
board
of
health
once
by
christian
men
bent
upon
proving
what
could
be
done
on
their
plan
with
the
worst
tenement
house
and
a
good
deal
was
accomplished
the
mortality
was
brought
below
the
general
of
the
city
and
the
condition
of
the
living
was
made
by
comparison
tolerable
only
the
best
was
bad
in
that
spot
on

of
the
good

sense
and
the
third

the
court
was
taken
in

it
was
by

authorities
who
destroyed
it

they
should
have
done
a
generation
before
oh

getting
there

with

it

was

at

was
evenly
divided
between

with
only

caught
it

has
more

because
of
the

flagged

speaking

reminds
me
of
the
big
flat
in
mott
street
a
mighty
tenement
with
room
for
a
hundred
families
that
was
another
instance
of
reform
by
which
i
mean
that
it
came
before
we
were
ready
for
it
and
willing
to
back
it
up
also
before
we
knew
just
how
that
house
was
built
by
the
philanthropists
of
those
days
on
such
a
generous
scale
that
it
reached
clear
through
the
block
to
elizabeth
street
it
had
not
occurred
to
the
builders
that
the
neighborhood
was
one
in
which
such
an
arrangement
might
prove
of
special
convenience
to
the
lawbreakers
with
which
it
swarmed
thieves
and
thugs
made
it
a
runway
and
decent
people
shunned
it
other
philanthropists
with
the
will
but
without
the
wisdom
that
was
needed
took
it
up
and
tried
to
make
a
workingwoman
home
of
it
but
that
end
was
worse
than
the
beginning
the
women
would
have
none
of
the
rules
that
went
with
the
philanthropy
and
the
big
flat
lapsed
back
among
the
slum
tenements
and
became
the
worst
of
a
bad
lot
i
speak
of
it
here
because
just
now
the
recollection
of
it
is
a
kind
of
a
milestone
in
the
battle
with
the
slum
twenty
years
after
stewart
the
merchant
prince
set
another

the

hotel
which
he
intended
for
his
and
that
was
a
worse
failure
than
the
first
for
it
never
served
the
purpose
he
intended
for
it
and
now
just
as
i
am
writing
this
they
are
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
a
real
woman
hotel
which
will
not
be
a
failure
though
it
will
hardly
reach
the
same
class
which
the
remodellers
of
the
big
flat
had
in
mind
however
we
shall
get
there

the

cunning

thrown
in

was
a
new
doctrine

that
day

any
power
should
intervene

him

it

to
be
a
hardship

the
great
growth
of
our
city
to
be
a
worse
peril
than
what
had
gone
before
but
what
we
got
was
according
to
our
sense
at
least
the
will
was
there
money
was
raised
to
build
model
houses
and
a
bill
to
give
the
health
authorities
summary
powers
in
dealing
with
tenements
was
sent
to
the
legislature
the
landlords
held
it
up
until
the
last
day
of
the
session
when
it
was
forced
through
by
an
angered
public
opinion
shorn
of
its
most
significant
clause
which
proposed
the
licensing
of
tenements
and
so
their
control
and
effective
repression
however
the
landlords
had
received
a
real
many
of
them
got
rid
of
their
property
which
in
a
large
number
of
cases
they
had
never
seen
and
tried
to
forget
the
source
of
their
wealth
light
and
air
did
find
their
way
into
the
tenements
in
a
fashion
and
we
began
to
count
the
tenants
as
souls
that
is
another
of
our
milestones
in
the
history
of
new
york
they
were
never
reckoned
so
before
no
one
ever
thought
of
them
as
souls
so
restored
to
human
fellowship

the
twilight
of
the
that
had
penetrated
to
their
dens
the
first
tenement
house
committee
was
able
to
make
them
out
better
than
the
houses
they
lived
in
and
a
long
step
forward
was
taken
the
mulberry
bend
the
wicked
core
of
the
bloody
sixth
ward
was
marked
for
destruction
and
all
slumdom
held
its
breath
to
see
it
go
with
that
gone
it
seemed
as
if
the
old
days
must
be
gone
too
never
to
return
there
would
not
be
another
mulberry

who
never

it
like
nothing
i
ever
saw
before

hope
ever
to
see
again
a
crooked
lot
built
over
with
rotten
structures
that
harbored
the
very
dregs
of
humanity
ordinary
enough
to
look
at
from
the
street

pierced
by
a
maze
of
foul
alleys
in
the
depths

which
skulked
the
tramp
and
the
outcast
thief
with
loathsome
wrecks

come
away
in
a
ferment

anger

that
would
keep
me
awake
far
into

hours
planning

of
its
destruction
that
was
what
it
was
like
thank
god
we
shall
never
see
another
such
illustration
a
cellar
dive
in
the
bend
that
was
the
exhibit
that
urged
us
on
but
the
civic
conscience
was
not
very
robust
yet
and
required
many
and
protracted
naps
it
slumbered
fitfully
eight
long
years
waking
up
now
and
then
with
a
start
while
the
bend
lay
stewing
in
its
slime
i
wondered
often
in
those
years
of
delay
if
it
was
just
plain
stupidity
that
kept
the
politicians
from
spending
the
money
which
the
law
had
put
within
their
grasp
for
with
every
year
that
passed
a
million
dollars
that
could
have
been
used
for
small
park
purposes
was
lost
but
they
were
wiser
than
i
understood
when
i
saw
the
changes
which
letting
in
the
sunshine
worked
they
were
not
of
the
kind
that
made
for
their
good
we
had
all
believed
it
but
they
knew
it
all
along
at
the
same
time
they
lost
none
of
the
chances
that
offered
they
helped
the
landlords
in
the
bend
who
considered
themselves
greatly
aggrieved
because
their
property
was
thereafter
to
front
on
a
park
instead
of
a
pigsty
to
transfer
the
whole
assessment
of
half
a
million
dollars
for
park
benefit
to
the
city
they
undid
in
less
than
six
weeks
what
it
had
taken
considerably
more
than
six
years
to
do
but
the
park
was
cheap
at
the
price
we
could
afford
to
pay
all
it
cost
to
wake
us
up
when
finally
upon
the
wave
of
wrath
excited
by
the
parkhurst
and
lexow
disclosures
reform
came
with
a
shock
that
dislodged
tammany
it
found
us
wide
awake
and
it
must
be
admitted
not
a
little
astonished
at
our
sudden
access
of
righteousness
footnote
the
small
parks
law
of
allowed
the
expenditure
of

million

a

making

as
payment
for
work
done

went

that
became
the

tammany
made
notes
the
cry
meant
that
we
were
tired
of
too
much
virtue
of
what
was
done
how
it
was
done
and
why
during
those
years
i
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
further
in
these

here
i
wish
to
measure
the
stretch
we
have
come
since
i
wrote
how
the
other
half
lives
thirteen
years
ago
some
of
it
we
came
plodding
and
some
at
full
speed
some
of
it
in
the
face
of
every
obstacle
that
could
be
thrown
in
our
way
wresting
victory
from
defeat
at
every
step
some
of
it
with
the
enemy
on
the
run
take
it
all
together
it
is
a
long
way
much
of
it
will
not
have
to
be
travelled
over
again
the

started
as
it
has
been

slip
many
a

it
may
even
be
stopped
for
a
season
but
it
can
never
be
made
to
work
backward
even
tammany
knows
that
and
gropes
desperately
for
a
new
hold
a
certificate
of
character
in
the
last
election
she
laid
loud
claim
to
having
built
many
new
schools
though
she
had
done
little
more
than
to
carry
out
the
plans
of
the
previous
reform
administration
where
they
could
not
be
upset
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
had
fallen
behind
again
sadly
but
even
the
claim
was
significant
how
long
we
strove
for
those
schools
to
no
purpose
our
arguments
our
anger
the
anxious
pleading
of
philanthropists
who
saw
the
young
on
the
east
side
going
to
ruin
the
warning
year
after
year
of
the
superintendent
of
schools
that
the
compulsory
education
law
was
but
an
empty
mockery
where
it
was
most
needed
the
knocking
of
uncounted
thousands
of
children
for
whom
there
was
no
room
uncounted
in
sober
fact
there
was
not
even
a
way
of
finding
out
how
many
were
adrift
brought
only
the
response
that
the
tax
rate
must
be
kept
down
kept
down
it
was
waste
was
successfully
averted
at
the
spigot
at
the
bunghole
it
went
on
unchecked
in
a
swarming
population
like
that
you
must
have
either
schools
or
jails
and
the
jails
waxed
fat
with
the
overflow
the
east
side
that
had
been
orderly
became
a
hotbed
of
child
crime
and
when
in
answer
to
the
charge
made
by
a
legislative
committee
that
the
father
forced
his
child
into
the
shop
on
a
perjured
age
certificate
to
labor
when
he
ought
to
have
been
at
play
that
father
bent
and
with
unceasing
toil
flung
back
the
charge
with
the
bitter
reproach
that
we
gave
him
no
other
choice
that
it
was
either
the
street
or
the
shop
for
his
boy
and
that
perjury
for
him
was
cheaper
than
the
ruin
of
the
child
we
were
mute
what
indeed
was
there
to
say
the
crime
was
ours
not
his
that
was
seven
years
ago
once
since
then
have
we
been
where
we
could
count
the
months
to
the
time
when
every
child
that
knocked
should
find
a
seat
in
our
schools

was
simplicity
itself

of
keeping

all

at

for

had
been
clubbed
away

snarled
and
showed
its
teeth
at
the

raging

impotent

saw
it
beaten
to
death

little
dreamed
then
that
the

beast
dead
should
prove
the
undoing
of
the
monstrous
wrong
done
by
the

i
had
slept

a
man
down
and
arbitrate
sitting
on
him
and
this
was
such
a
time
it
was
what
we
started
out
to
do
with
the
rear
tenements
the
worst
of
the
slum
barracks
and
it
would
have
been
better
had
we
kept
on
that
track
i
have
always
maintained
that
we
made
a
false
move
when
we
stopped
to
discuss
damages
with
the
landlord
or
to
hear
his
side
of
it
at
all
his
share
in
it
was
our
grievance
it
blocked
the
mortality
records
with
its
burden
of
human
woe
the
damage
was
all
ours
the
profit
all
his
if
there
are
damages
to
collect
he
should
foot
the
bill
not
we
vested
rights
are
to
be
protected
but
as
i
have
said
no
man
has
a
right
to
be
protected
in
killing
his
neighbor

however
they
are
down
the
worst
of
them
the
community
has
asserted
its
right
to
destroy
tenements
that
destroy
life
and
for
that
cause
we
bought
the
slum
off
in
the
mulberry
bend
at
its
own
figure
on
the
rear
tenements
we
set
the

set

gap
have
acquired
standards

poverty
gap
has
risen
even
to
the
height
of
neckties
the
time
is
fresh
in
my
recollection
when
a
different
kind
of
necktie
was
its
pride
when
the
he
was
barely
nineteen
who
wore
it
on
the
gallows
took
leave
of
the
captain
of
detectives
with
the
cheerful
invitation
to
come
over
to
the
wake
they
have
a
hell
of
a
time
and
the
event
fully
redeemed
the
promise
the
whole
gap
turned
out
to
do
the
dead
bully
honor
i
have
not
heard
from
the
gap
and
hardly
from
hell
kitchen
in
five
years
the
last
news
from
the
kitchen
was
when
the
thin
wedge
of
a
column
of
negroes
in
their
migration
tried
to
squeeze
in
and
provoked
a
race
war
but
that
in
fairness
should
not
be
laid
up
against
it
in
certain
local
aspects
it
might
be
accounted
a
sacred
duty
as
much
so
as
to
get
drunk
and
provoke
a
fight
on
the
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
the
boyne
but
on
the
whole
the
kitchen
has
grown
orderly
the
gang
rarely
beats
a
policeman
nowadays
and
it
has
not
killed
one
in
a
long
while
so
one
after
another
the
outworks
of
the
slum
have
been
taken
it
has
been
beaten
in
many
battles
even
to
the
tenement
on
the
lot
have
we
put
a
stop
but
its
legacy
is
with
us
in
the
habitations
of
two
million
souls
this
is
the
sore
spot
and
as
against
it
all
the
rest
seems
often
enough
unavailing
yet
it
can
not
be
it
is
true
that
the
home
about
which
all
that
is
to
work
for
permanent
progress
must
cluster
is
struggling
against
desperate
odds
in
the
tenement
and
that
the
struggle
has
been
reflected
in
the
morals
of
the
people
in
the
corruption
of
the
young
to
an
alarming
extent
but
it
must
be
that
the
higher
standards
now
set
up
on
every
hand
in
the
cleaner
streets
in
the
better
schools
in
the
parks
and
the
clubs
in
the
settlements
and
in
the
thousand
and
one
agencies
for
good
that
touch
and
help
the
lives
of
the
poor
at
as
many
points
will
tell
at
no
distant
day
and
react
upon
the
homes
and
upon
their
builders
in
fact
we
know
it
is
so
from
our
experience
last
fall
when
the
summons
to
battle
for
the
people
homes
came
from
the
young
on
the
east
side
it
was
their
fight
for
the
very
standards
i
spoke
of
their
reply
to
the
appeal
they
made
to
them
to
any
one
who
knew
that
east
side
ten
years
ago
the
difference
between
that
day
and
this
in
the
appearance
of
the
children
whom
he
sees
there
must
be
striking
rags
and
dirt
are
now
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
perhaps
the
statement
is
a
trifle
too
strong
as
to
the
dirt
but
dirt
is
not
harmful
except
when
coupled
with
rags
it
can
be
washed
off
and
nowadays
is
washed
off
where
such
a
thing
would
have
been
considered
affectation
in
the
days
that
were
soap
and
water
have
worked
a
visible
cure
already
that
goes
more
than
they
are
moral
agents
of
the
first
value
in
the
slum
and
the
day
is
coming
soon
now
when
with
real
rapid
transit
and
the
transmission
of
power
to
suburban
workshops
the
reason
for
the
outrageous
crowding
shall
cease
to
exist
it
has
been
a
long
while
a
whole
century
of
city
packing
closer
and
more
close
but
it
looks
as
if
the
tide
were
to
turn
at
last
meanwhile
philanthropy
is
not
sitting
idle
and
waiting
it
is
building
tenements
on
the
humane
plan
that
lets
in
sunshine
and
air
and
hope
it
is
putting
up
hotels
deserving
of
the
name
for
the
army
that
but
just
now
had
no
other
home
than
the
cheap
lodging
houses
which
inspector
byrnes
fitly
called
nurseries
of
crime
these
also
are
standards
from
which
there
is
no
backing
down
even
if
coming
up
to
them
is
slow
work
and
they
are
here
to
stay
for
they
pay
that
is
the
test
not
charity
but
justice
that
is
the
gospel
which
they
preach

mulberry

flushed
with
the
success
of
many
victories

challenged
the

a

and
bade
it
come
on

on
our
side

best
the

marshalled

marshalled

tammany
produced
its

it
pointed

the
increased

rate
showed
what
it
had
cost
to
build

to

called
it

recklessness
the
issue
was
made
sharp

clear
the

cry
of
the

was
characteristic
to
hell
with
reform
we
all
remember
the
result
politics
interfered
and
turned
victory
into
defeat
we
were
beaten
i
shall
never
forget
that
election
night
i
walked
home
through
the
bowery
in
the
midnight
hour
and
saw
it
gorging
itself
like
a
starved
wolf
upon
the
promise
of
the
morrow
drunken
men
and
women
sat
in
every
doorway
howling
ribald
songs
and
curses
hard
faces
i
had
not
seen
for
years
showed
themselves
about
the
dives
the
mob
made
merry
after
its
fashion
the
old
days
were
coming
back
reform
was
dead
and
decency
with
it
illustration
in
the
hallway
i
ran
across
two
children
little
tots
who
were
inquiring
their
way
to
commissioner
a
year
later
i
passed
that
same
way
on
the
night
of
election
the
scene
was
strangely
changed
the
street
was
unusually
quiet
for
such
a
time
men
stood
in
groups
about
the
saloons
and
talked
in
whispers
with
serious
faces
the
name
of
roosevelt
was
heard
on
every
hand
the
dives
were
running
but
there
was
no
shouting
and
violence
was
discouraged
when
on
the
following
day
i
met
the
proprietor
of
one
of
the
oldest
concerns
in
the
bowery
which
while
doing
a
legitimate
business
caters
necessarily
to
its
crowds
and
therefore
sides
with
them
he
told
me
with
bitter
reproach
how
he
had
been
stricken
in
pocket
a
gambler
had
just
been
in
to
see
him
who
had
come
on
from
the
far
west
in
anticipation
of
a
town
and
had
got
all
ready
to
open
a
house
in
the
tenderloin
he
brought
to
put
in
the
business
and
he
came
to
take
it
away
to
baltimore
just
now
the
cashier
of
bank
told
me
that
two
other
gentlemen
gamblers
yes
what
you
call
them
had
drawn
which
they
would
have
invested
here
and
had
gone
after
him
think
of
all
that
money
gone
to
baltimore
that
what
you
done
footnote
when
roosevelt
was
elected
governor
after
a
fierce
fight
with
tammany
i
went
over
to
police
headquarters
thinking
of
the
sad
state
of
that
man
and
in
the
hallway
i
ran
across
two
children
little
tots
who
were
inquiring
their
way
to
the
commissioner
the
older
was
a
hunchback
girl
who
led
her
younger
brother
he
could
not
have
been
over
five
or
six
years
old
by
the
hand
they
explained
their
case
to
me
they
came
from
allen
street
some
bad
ladies
had
moved
into
the
tenement
and
when
complaint
was
made
that
sent
the
police
there
the
father
who
was
a
poor
jewish
tailor
was
blamed
the
tenants
took
it
out
of
the
boy
by
punching
his
nose
till
it
bled
whereupon
the
children
went
straight
to
mulberry
street
to
see
the
commissioner
and
get
justice
it
was
the
first
time
in
twenty
years
that
i
had
known
allen
street
to
come
to
police
headquarters
for
justice
and
in
the
discovery
that
the
legacy
of
roosevelt
had
reached
even
to
the
little
children
i
read
the
doom
of
the
slum
despite
its
loud
vauntings
no
it
was
not
true
that
reform
was
dead
with
decency
we
had
our
innings
four
years
later
and
proved
it
of
which
more
farther
on
it
was
not
the
slum
that
had
won
it
was
we
who
had
lost
we
were
not
up
to
the
mark
not
yet
we
may
lose
again
more
than
once
but
even
our
losses
shall
be
our
gains
if
we
learn
from
them
and
we
are
doing
that
new
york
is
a
many
times
cleaner
and
better
city
than
it
was
twenty
or
even
ten
years
ago
then
i
was
able
to
grasp
easily
the
whole
plan
for
wresting
it
from
the
neglect
and
indifference
that
had
put
us
where
we
were
it
was
chiefly
almost
wholly
remedial
in
its
scope
now
it
is
preventive
constructive
and
no
ten
men
could
gather
all
the
threads
and
hold
them
we
have
made
are
making
headway
and
no
tammany
has
the
power
to
stop
us
they
know
it
too
at
the
hall
and
were
in
such
frantic
haste
to
fill
their
pockets
this
last
time
that
they
abandoned
their
old
ally
the
tax
rate
and
the
pretence
of
making
bad
government
cheap
government
tammany
dug
its
arms
into
the
treasury
fairly
up
to
the
elbows
raising
taxes
assessments
and
salaries
all
at
once
and
collecting
blackmail
from
everything
in
sight
its
charges
for
the
lesson
it
taught
us
came
high
but
we
can
afford
to
pay
them
if
to
learning
it
we
add
common
sense
we
shall
discover
the
bearings
of
it
all
without
trouble
yesterday
i
picked
up
a
book
a
learned
disquisition
on
government
and
read
on
the
affectionately
dedicated
to
all
who
despise
politics
that
was
not
common
sense
to
win
the
battle
with
the
slum
we
must
not
begin
by
despising
politics
we
have
been
doing
that
too
long
the
politics
of
the
slum
are
apt
to
be
like
the
slum
itself
dirty
then
they
must
be
cleaned
it
is
what
the
fight
is
about
politics
are
the
weapon
we
must
learn
to
use
it
so
as
to
cut
straight
and
sure
that
is
common
sense
and
the
golden
rule
as
applied
to
tammany
some
years
ago
the
united
states
government
conducted
an
inquiry
into
the
slums
of
great
cities
to
its
staff
of
experts
was
attached
a
chemist
who
gathered
and
isolated
a
lot
of
bacilli
with
fearsome
latin
names
in
the
tenements
where
he
went
among
those
he
labelled
were
the
pyogenes
the
the
and
the
buccalis
i
made
a
note
of
the
names
at
the
time
because
of
the
dread
with
which
they
inspired
me
but
i
searched
the
collection
in
vain
for
the
real
bacillus
of
the
slum
it
escaped
science
to
be
identified
by
human
sympathy
and
a
community
with
that
of
ordinary
human
selfishness
the
antitoxin
has
been
found
and
it
is
applied
successfully
since
justice
has
replaced
charity
on
the
prescription
the
patient
is
improving
and
the
improvement
is
not
confined
to
him
it
is
general
conscience
is
not
a
local
issue
in
our
day
a
few
years
ago
a
united
states
senator
sought
re√´lection
on
the
platform
that
the
decalogue
and
the
golden
rule
were
glittering
generalities
that
had
no
place
in
politics
and
lost
we
have
not
quite
reached
the
millennium
yet
but
since
then
a
man
was
governor
in
the
empire
state
elected
on
the
pledge
that
he
would
rule
by
the
ten
commandments
these
are
facts
that
mean
much
or
little
according
to
the
way
one
looks
at
them
the
significant
thing
is
that
they
are
facts
and
that
in
spite
of
slipping
and
sliding
the
world
moves
forward
not
backward
the
poor
we
shall
have
always
with
us
but
the
slum
we
need
not
have
these
two
do
not
rightfully
belong
together
their
present
partnership
is
at
once
poverty
worst
hardship
and
our
worst
blunder
chapter
iii
the
devil
money
that
was
what
the
women
called
it
and
the
name
stuck
and
killed
the
looters
the
young
men
of
the
east
side
began
it
and
the
women
finished
it
it
was
a
campaign
of
decency
against
tammany
that
one
of
of
which
i
am
going
to
make
the
record
brief
as
may
be
for
we
all
remember
it
and
also
thank
god
that
decency
won
the
fight
if
ever
inhuman
robbery
deserved
the
name
that
which
caused
the
downfall
of
tammany
surely
did
drunk
with
the
power
and
plunder
of
four
long
unchallenged
years
during
which
the
honest
name
of
democracy
was
pilloried
in
the
sight
of
all
men
as
the
active
partner
of
blackmail
and
the
brothel
the
monstrous
malignity
reached
a
point
at
last
where
it
was
no
longer
to
be
borne
then
came
the
crash
the
pillory
lied
tammany
is
no
more
a
political
organization
than
it
is
the
benevolent
concern
it
is
innocently
supposed
to
be
by
some
people
who
never
learn
it
neither
knows
nor
cares
for
principles
koch
said
its
president
of
the
health
department
when
mention
was
made
in
his
hearing
of
the
authority
of
the
great
german
doctor
who
is
that
man
koch
you
are
talking
about
and
he
was
typical
of
the
rest
his
function
was
to
collect
the
political
revenue
of
the
department
and
the
city
was
overrun
with
smallpox
for
the
first
time
in
thirty
years
the
police
force
of
whom
roosevelt
had
made
heroes
became
the
tools
of
robbers
robbery
is
the
business
of
tammany
for
that
and
for
that
only
is
it
organized
politics
are
merely
the
convenient
pretence
i
do
not
mean
that
every
tammany
man
is
a
thief
probably
the
great
majority
of
its
adherents
honestly
believe
that
it
stands
for
something
worth
fighting
for
for
personal
freedom
for
the
people
cause
and
their
delusion
is
the
opportunity
of
scoundrels
they
have
never
understood
its
organization
or
read
its
history
for
a
hundred
years
that
has
been
an
almost
unbroken
record
of
fraud
and
peculation
its
very
founder
william
mooney
was
charged
with
being
a
deserter
from
the
patriot
army
to
the
british
forces
he
was
later
on
removed
from
office
as
superintendent
of
the
almshouse
for
swindling
the
city
aaron
burr
plotted
treason

its
councils

briefest

a

of
its
conspicuous
leaders
removed
indicted
or
tried
for
default
or
theft
and
the
fewest
were
punished
the
civic
history
of
new
york
to
the
present
day
is
one
long
struggle
to
free
itself
from
its
blighting
grip
its
people
parties
its
committees
of
seventy
were
ever
emergency
measures
to
that
end
but
they
succeeded
only
for
a
season
there

been

mayors
but
not
for
long
there
have
been
attempts
to
reform
the
organization
from
within
but
they
have
been
failures
you
can
not
reform
an
organized
appetite
except
by
reforming
it
away
and
then
there
would
be
nothing
left
of
the
organization
for
whatever
the
rank
and
file
have
believed
the
organization
has
never
been
anything
else
but
the
means
of
satisfying
the
appetite
that
never
will
be
cloyed
whatever
principles
it
has
professed
they
have
served
the
purpose
only
of
filling
the
pockets
of
the
handful
of
men
who
rule
its
inner
councils
and
use
it
to
their
own
enrichment
and
our
loss
and
disgrace
we
have
heard
its
most
successful
leader
testify
brazenly
before
the
mazet
legislative
committee
that
he
was
in
politics
working
for
his
own
pocket
all
the
time
that
was
his
principle
and
his
followers
applauded
till
the
room
rang
that
is
the
tammany
which
has
placed
murderers
and
gamblers
in
its
high
seats
that
is
the
tammany
which
you
have
to
fight
at
every
step
when
battling
with
the
slum
the
tammany
which
unmasked
and
beaten
by
the
parkhurst
and
lexow
disclosures
came
back
with
the
greater
new
york
to
exploit
the
opportunity
reform
had
made
for
itself
and
gave
us
a
lesson
we
will
not
soon
forget
for
at
last
it
dropped
all
pretence
and
showed
its
real
face
to
us
civil
service
reform
was
thrown
to
the
winds
the
city
departments
were
openly
parcelled
out
among
the
district
leaders
a
office
to
one
two
to
another
to
even
up
that
is
the
secret
of
the
organization
which
politicians
admire
it
does
make
a
strong
body
how
it
served
the
city
in
one
department
the
smallpox
epidemic
bore
witness
that
department
the
pride
of
the
city
and
its
mainstay
in
days
of
danger
was
wrecked
the
first
duty
of
the
new
president
when
the
four
years
were
over
and
tammany
out
again
was
to
remove
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
useless
employees
their
only
function
had
been
to
draw
the
salaries
which
the
city
paid
the
streets
that
had
been
clean
became
dirty
the
voter
was
back
behind
the
broom
and
they
swarmed
once
more
with
children
for
whom
there
was
no
room
in
school
officials
who
drew
big
salaries
starved
the
inmates
of
the
almshouse
on
weak
tea
and
dry
bread
and
bellevue
the
poor
people
hospital
became
a
public
scandal
in
one
night
there
were
five
drunken
fights
one
of
them
between
two
of
the
attendants
who
dropped
the
corpse
they
were
carrying
to
the
morgue
and
fought
over
it
the
tenements
were
plunged
back
into
the
foulness
of
their
worst
day
the
inspectors
were
answerable
not
to
the
health
board
but
to
the
district
leader
and
the
landlord
who
stood
well
with
him
thumbed
his
nose
at
them
and
at
their
orders
to
clean
up
the
neighborhood
parks
acquired
at
such
heavy
sacrifice
lay
waste
tammany
took
no
step
toward
improving
them
one
it
did
take
up
at
fort
george
and
though
the
property
only
cost
the
city
the
bills
for
taking
it
were
that
is
the
true
tammany
style
in
the
seward
park
where
the
need
of
relief
was
greatest
tammany
election
district
captains
built
booths
rent
free
for
the
sale
of
dry
goods
and
fish
that
was
their
share
wealthy
corporations
were
made
to
pay
heavily
for
peace
timid
storekeepers
were
blackmailed
one
a
jew
told
his
story
he
was
ordered
to
pay
five
dollars
a
week
for
privilege
of
keeping
open
sundays
he
paid
and
they
asked
ten
when
he
refused
he
was
told
that
it
would
be
the
worse
for
him
he
closed
up
the
very
next
week
he
was
sued
for
a
hundred
dollars
by
a
man
of
whom
he
had
never
borrowed
anything
he
did
not
defend
the
suit
and
it
went
against
him
in
three
days
the
sheriff
was
in
his
store
he
knew
the
hopelessness
of
it
then
and
went
out
and
mortgaged
his
store
and
paid
the
bill
the
next
week
another
man
sued
him
for
a
hundred
dollars
he
did
not
owe
he
went
and
threw
himself
on
his
mercy
and
the
man
let
him
off
for
the
costs
he
was
one
of
the
many
thousands
of
toilers
who
look
with
fear
to
the
approaching
summer
because
it
is
then
the
hot
tenement
kills
their
babies
their
one
chance
of
life
then
depends
upon
the
supply
of
ice
that
is
hawked
from
door
to
door
in
small
pieces
since
tenements
have
rarely
other
refrigerator
than
the
draughty
the
greed
of
politicians
plotted
to
deprive
them
of
even
this
chance
they
had
control
of
docks
and
means
of
transportation
and
they
cornered
the
supply
raising
the
price
from
thirty
to
sixty
cents
a
hundred
pounds
and
suppressing
the
piece
some
of
them
that
sat
in
high
official
station
grew
rich
but
the
poor
man
babies
died
and
he
saw
at
last
the
quality
of
the
friendship
tammany
professed
for
him
the
pedlers
blackmailed
and
driven
from
pillar
to
post
saw
it
they
had
escaped
from
unbearable
tyranny
in
their
old
home
to
find
a
worse
where
they
thought
to
be
free
for
to
their
oppressors
yonder
at
least
their
women
were
sacred
it
is
difficult
to
approach
calmly
what
is
left
of
the
diabolical
recital
the
police
set
once
more
to
collecting
blackmail
from
saloon
keepers
gambling
hells
policy
shops
and
houses
of
ill
fame
under
a
chief
who
on
a
policeman
pay
became
in
a
few
short
years
fairly
bloated
with
wealth
sank
to
the
level
of
their
occupation
or
into
helpless
or
hopeless
compliance
with
the
apparently
inevitable
the
east
side
where
the
home
struggled
against
such
heavy
odds
became
a
sinkhole
of
corruption
the
tenements
were
overrun
with
lewd
women
who
paid
the
police
for
protection
and
received
it
back
of
them
the
politician
who
controlled
all
and
took
the
profits
this
newspaper
arraignment
published
in
january
tells
the
bald
truth
imagine
if
you
can
a
section
of
the
city
territory
completely
dominated
by
one
man
without
whose
permission
neither
legitimate
nor
illegitimate
business
can
be
conducted
where
illegitimate
business
is
encouraged
and
legitimate
business
discouraged
where
the
respectable
residents
have
to
fasten
their
doors
and
windows
summer
nights
and
sit
in
their
rooms
with
asphyxiating
air
and
one
hundred
degrees
temperature
rather
than
try
to
catch
the
faint
whiff
of
breeze
in
their
natural
breathing
places
the
stoops
of
their
homes
where
naked
women
dance
by
night
in
the
streets
and
unsexed
men
prowl
like
vultures
through
the
darkness
on
business
not
only
permitted
but
encouraged
by
the
police
where
the
education
of
infants
begins
with
the
knowledge
of
prostitution
and
the
training
of
little
girls
is
training
in
the
arts
of
phryne
where
american
girls
brought
up
with
the
refinements
of
american
homes
are
imported
from
small
towns
massachusetts
connecticut
and
new
jersey
and
kept
as
virtually
prisoners
as
if
they
were
locked
up
behind
jail
bars
until
they
have
lost
all
semblance
of
womanhood
where
small
boys
are
taught
to
solicit
for
the
women
of
disorderly
houses
where
there
is
an
organized
society
of
young
men
whose
sole
business
in
life
is
to
corrupt
young
girls
and
turn
them
over
to
bawdy
houses
where
men
walking
with
their
wives
along
the
street
are
openly
insulted
where
children
that
have
adult
diseases
are
the
chief
patrons
of
the
hospitals
and
dispensaries
where
it
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
that
murder
rape
robbery
and
theft
go
unpunished
in
short
where
the
premium
of
the
most
awful
forms
of
vice
is
the
profit
of
the
politicians
there
is
no
woman
and
song
over
there
the
is
stale
beer
the
is
a
degraded
machine
and
the
is
the
wail
of
the
outraged
innocent
the
political
backers
have
got
it
down
to
what
has
been
called
a
basis
called
so
from
the
fact
that
in
some
of
these
places
they
issued
tickets
on
the
plan
of
a
commutation
and
had
cash
registers
at
the
entries
lest
some
one
think
the
newspaper
exaggerating
after
all
let
me
add
bishop
potter
comment
before
his
diocesan
convention
he
will
not
be
suspected
of
sensationalism
the
corrupt
system
whose
infamous
details
have
been
steadily
uncovered
to
our
increasing
horror
and
humiliation
was
brazenly
ignored
by
those
who
were
fattening
on
its
spoils
and
the
world
was
presented
with
the
astounding
spectacle
of
a
great
municipality
whose
civic
mechanism
was
largely
employed
in
trading
in
the
bodies
and
souls
of
the
innocent
and
defenceless
what
has
been
published
in
this
connection
is
but
the
merest
hint
of
what
exists
and
exists
most
appalling
of
all
as
the
evidence
has
come
to
me
under
the
seal
of
confidence
in
overwhelming
volume
and
force
to
demonstrate
under
a
system
of
terrorism
which
compels
its
victims
to
recognize
that
to
denounce
it
means
the
utter
ruin
so
far
as
all
their
worldly
interests
are
concerned
of
those
who
dare
to
do
so
this
infamous
organization
for
making
merchandise
of
girls
and
boys
and
defenceless
men
and
women
has
adroitly
sought
to
obscure
a
situation
concerning
which
all
honest
people
are
entirely
clear
by
saying
that
vice
can
not
be
wholly
suppressed
nobody
has
made
upon
the
authorities
of
new
york
any
such
grotesque
demand
all
that
our
citizens
have
asked
is
that
the
government
of
the
city
shall
not
be
employed
to
protect
a
trade
in
vice
which
is
carried
on
for
the
benefit
of
a
political
organization
the
case
is
entirely
clear
no
mephistophelian
cunning
can
obscure
it
and
i
thank
god
that
there
is
abundant
evidence
that
the
end
of
such
a
condition
of
things
is
not
far
off
it
was
indeed
coming
but
tammany
gorged
with
power
and
the
lust
of
it
neither
saw
nor
heeded
at
a
meeting
of
young
men
on
the
east
side
one
of
them
responding
to
an
address
by
felix
adler
drew
such
a
picture
of
the
conditions
prevailing
there
that
the
echoes
of
the
meeting
found
its
way
into
the
farthest
places
now
you
go
he
said
to
your
quiet
home
in
a
decent
street
where
no
harm
comes
to
you
or
your
wife
or
children
in
the
night
for
it
is
their
home
and
we
we
go
with
our
high
resolves
the
noble
ambitions
you
have
stirred
to
our
tenements
where
evil
lurks
in
the
darkness
at
every
step
where
innocence
is
murdered
in
babyhood
where
mothers
bemoan
the
birth
of
a
daughter
as
the
last
misfortune
where
virtue
is
sold
into
a
worse
slavery
than
ever
our
fathers
knew
and
our
sisters
betrayed
by
paid
panders
where
the
name
of
home
is
as
a
bitter
mockery
for
alas
we
have
none
these
are
the
standards
to
which
we
go
from
here
and
then
followed
the
whole
amazing
story
of
damning
conspiracy
between
power
and
vice
in
those
tenements
before
which
a
whole
city
stood
aghast
a
meeting
was
called
the
following
day
by
adler
of
men
and
women
who
had
the
welfare
of
their
city
at
heart
and
when
they
had
heard
the
story
they
resolved
that
they
would
not
rest
till
those
things
were
no
longer
true
one
of
their
number
was
the
rev
robert
paddock
the
priest
in
charge
of
bishop
potter
right
in
the
heart
of
it
all
in
stanton
street
he
set
about
gathering
evidence
that
would
warrant
the
arraignment
of
the
in
his
district
but
when
he
brought
it
to
the
police
he
was
treated
with
scorn
and
called
liar
the
measure
was
nearly
full
bishop
potter
came
back
from
the
east
where
he
had
been
travelling
and
met
his
people
out
of
that
meeting
came
the
most
awful
arraignment
of
a
city
government
which
the
world
has
ever
heard
nowhere
else
on
earth
the
bishop
wrote
to
the
mayor
of
new
york
certainly
not
in
any
civilized
or
christian
community
does
there
exist
such
a
situation
as
defiles
and
dishonors
new
york
in
the
name
of
these
little
ones
his
letter
ran
these
weak
and
defenceless
ones
christian
and
hebrew
alike
of
many
races
and
tongues
but
homes
in
which
god
is
feared
and
his
law
revered
and
virtue
and
decency
honored
and
exemplified
i
call
upon
you
sir
to
save
these
people
who
are
in
a
very
real
way
committed
to
your
charge
from
a
living
hell
defiling
deadly
damning
to
which
the
criminal
supineness
of
the
constituted
authorities
set
for
the
defence
of
decency
and
good
order
threatens
to
doom
them
the
mayor
virtual
response
was
to
put
the
corrupt
chief
of
police
in
practically
complete
and
irresponsible
charge
of
the
force
richard
croker
the
boss
of
tammany
hall
had
openly
counselled
violence
at
the
election
then
pending
and
the
chief
in
a
general
order
to
the
force
repeated
the
threat
but
they
had
reckoned
without
governor
roosevelt
he
compelled
the
mayor
to
have
the
order
rescinded
and
removed
the
district
attorney
who
had
been
elected
on
the
compact
platform
to
hell
with
reform
the
whole
city
was
aroused
the
chamber
of
commerce
formed
a
committee
of
fifteen
which
soon
furnished
evidence
without
stint
of
the
corruption
that
was
abroad
the
connection
between
the
police
and
the
gambling
dens
was
demonstrated
and
also
that
the
police
were
the
mere
tools
of
politics
in
tenements
that
were
investigated
flats
were
found
harboring
prostitutes
in
defiance
of
law
the
police
were
compelled
to
act
the
cadets
who
lived
by
seducing
young
girls
and
selling
them
to
their
employer
at
a
head
were
arrested
and
sent
to
jail
for
long
terms
they
showed
fight
and
it
developed
that
they
had
a
regular
organization
with
political
affiliations
the
campaign
of
approached
judge
jerome
went
upon
the
stump
and
rattled
the
brass
checks
from
the
that
paid
for
the
virtue
of
innocent
girls
the
daughters
of
his
hearers
the
mothers
of
the
east
side
the
very
tammany
women
themselves
rose
and
denounced
the
money
and
made
their
husbands
and
brothers
go
to
the
polls
and
vote
their
anger
the
world
knows
the
rest
the
red
light
of
the
east
side
damned
tammany
to
defeat
seth
low
was
elected
mayor
decency
once
more
moved
into
the
city
hall
and
into
the
homes
of
the
poor
croker
abdicated
and
went
away
and
a
new
day
broke
for
our
harassed
city
footnote
up
to
that
time
i
wrote
of
tammany
as
she
but
i
dropped
it
then
as
an
outrage
upon
the
sex
it
it
is
and
will
remain
hereafter
i
am
ashamed
of
ever
having
put
the
stigma
on
the
name
of
woman
that
in
brief
is
the
story
of
the
campaign
that
discharged
the
devil
as
paymaster
and
put
his
money
out
of
circulation
for
good
let

all
hope
chapter
iv
the
blight
of
the
in
a
stanton
street
tenement
the
other
day
i
stumbled
upon
a
polish
capmaker
home
there
were
other
capmakers
in
the
house
russian
and
polish
but
they
simply
lived
there
this
one
had
a
home
the
fact
proclaimed
itself
the
moment
the
door
was
opened
in
spite
of
the
darkness
the
rooms
were
in
the
rear
gloomy
with
the
twilight
of
the
tenement
although
the
day
was
sunny
without
but
neat
even
cosey
it
was
early
but
the
day
chores
were
evidently
done
the
sang
on
the
stove
at
which
a
girl
of
twelve
with
a
pale
but
cheery
face
and
sleeves
brushed
back
to
the
elbows
was
busy
poking
up
the
fire
a
little
boy
stood
by
the
window
flattening
his
nose
against
the
pane
and
gazed
wistfully
up
among
the
chimney
pots
where
a
piece
of
blue
sky
about
as
big
as
the
kitchen
could
be
made
out
i
remarked
to
the
mother
that
they
were
nice
rooms
illustration
with
his
whole
hungry
little
soul
in
his
eyes
ah
yes
she
said
with
a
weary
little
smile
that
struggled
bravely
with
hope
long
deferred
but
it
is
hard
to
make
a
home
here
we
would
so
like
to
live
in
the
front
but
we
ca
pay
the
rent
i
knew
the
front
with
its
unlovely
view
of
the
tenement
street
too
well
and
i
said
a
good
word
for
the
yard
or
court
it
could
not
be
called
it
was
too
small
for
that
which
rather
surprised
myself
i
had
found
few
virtues
enough
in
it
before
the
girl
at
the
stove
had
left
off
poking
the
fire
she
broke
in
the
moment
i
finished
with
eager
enthusiasm
why
they
have
the
sun
in
there
when
the
door
is
opened
the
light
comes
right
in
your
face
does
it
never
come
here
i
asked
and
wished
i
had
not
done
so
as
soon
as
the
words
were
spoken
the
child
at
the
window
was
listening
with
his
whole
hungry
little
soul
in
his
eyes
yes
it
did
she
said
once
every
summer
for
a
little
while
it
came
over
the
houses
she
knew
the
month
and
the
exact
hour
of
the
day
when
its
rays
shone
into
their
home
and
just
the
reach
of
its
slant
on
the
wall
they
had
lived
there
six
years
in
june
the
sun
was
due
a
haunting
fear
that
the
baby
would
ask
how
long
it
was
till
june
it
was
february
then
took
possession
of
me
and
i
hastened
to
change
the
subject
warsaw
was
their
old
home
they
kept
a
little
store
there
and
were
young
and
happy
oh
it
was
a
fine
city
with
parks
and
squares
and
bridges
over
the
beautiful
river
and
grass
and
flowers
and
birds
and
soldiers
put
in
the
girl
breathlessly
she
remembered
but
the
children
kept
coming
and
they
went
across
the
sea
to
give
them
a
better
chance
father
made
fifteen
dollars
a
week
much
money
but
there
were
long
seasons
when
there
was
no
work
she
the
mother
was
never
very
well
here
she
had
any
strength
and
the
baby
she
glanced
at
his
grave
white
face
and
took
him
in
her
arms
the
picture
of
the
two
and
of
the
girl
longing
back
to
the
fields
and
the
sunlight
in
their
prison
of
gloom
and
gray
walls
haunts
me
yet
i
have
not
had
the
courage
to
go
back
since
i
recalled
the
report
of
an
english
army
surgeon
which
i
read
years
ago
on
the
many
more
soldiers
that
died
were
killed
would
be
more
correct
in
barracks
into
which
the
sun
never
shone
than
in
those
that
were
open
to
the
light
they
have
yet
two
months
to
the
sun
in
stanton
street
the
capmaker
case
is
the
case
of
the
nineteenth
century
of
civilization
against
the
metropolis
of
america
the
home
the
family
are
the
rallying
points
of
civilization
the
greatness
of
a
city
is
to
be
measured
not
by
its
balance
sheets
of
exports
and
imports
not
by
its
fleet
of
merchantmen
or
by
its
miles
of
paved
streets
nor
even
by
its
colleges
its
art
museums
its
schools
of
learning
but
by
its
homes
new
york
has
all
these
but
its
people
live
in
tenements
where
all
the
conditions
which
surround
childhood
youth
and
womanhood
make
for
unrighteousness
this
still
after
forty
years
of
battling
during
which
we
have
gone
on
piling
layer
upon
layer
of
human
beings
and
calling
home
the
tenements
the
council
of
hygiene
found
in
have
become
and
their
population
of
has
swelled
into
nearly
a
million
and
there
were
four
flights
of
stairs
at
most
in
the
old
days
now
they
build
tenements
six
and
seven
stories
high
and
the
street
has
become
a
mere
runway
it
can
not
take
up
the
crowds
for
which
it
was
never
meant
go
look
at
those
east
side
streets
on
a
summer
evening
or
on
any
fair
sunday
when
at
all
events
some
of
the
workers
are
at
home
and
see
what
they
are
like
in
the
average
number
of
persons
to
each

in

counting
them
all
in

in
according
to

the
average
in
the

was
it
all
means
that
there
are
so
many
more
and
so
much
bigger
tenements
and
four
families
to
the
floor
where
there
were
two
before
statistics
are
not
my
hobby
i
like
to
get
their
human
story
out
of
them
anybody
who
wants
them
can
get
the
figures
in
the
census
books
but
as
an
instance
of
the
unchecked
drift
unchecked
as
yet
look
at
this
record
of
the
tenth
ward
the
most
crowded
spot
in
the
world
in
when
it
had
not
yet
attained
to
that
bad
eminence
it
contained
persons
or
to
the

in
the
census
showed
a
population
of
which
was

the

living

the

the
first
half
of
gave
a

persons
living
in

buildings
yet
to
be
heard
from
this
is
the
process
of
doubling
up
literally
since
the
cause
and
the
vehicle
of
it
all
is
the
tenement
which
in
the
year
had
crowded
a
single

in
that
ward
at
the

persons

was

five

the

are

let
us
look
at
them
squarely
and
see
in
the
first
place
it
is
no
answer
to
the
charge
that
new
york
way
of
housing
its
workers
is
the
worst
in
the
world
to
say
that
they
are
better
off
than
they
were
where
they
came
from
it
is
not
true
in
most
cases
as
far
as
the
home
is
concerned
a
shanty
is
better
than
a
flat
in
a
slum
tenement
any
day
even
if
it
were
true
it
would
still
be
beside
the
issue
in
poland
my
capmaker
counted
for
nothing
nothing
was
expected
of
him
here
he
ranks
after
a
few
brief
years
politically
equal
with
the
man
who
hires
his
labor
a
citizen
duty
is
expected
of
him
and
home
and
citizenship
are
convertible
terms
the
observation
of
the
frenchman
who
had
watched
the
experiment
of
herding
two
thousand
human
beings
in
eight
tenement
barracks
over
yonder
that
the
result
was
the
exasperation
of
the
tenant
against
society
is
true
the
world
over
we
have
done
as
badly
in
new
york
social
hatefulness
is
not
a
good
soil
for
citizenship
to
grow
in
where
political
equality
rules
nor
is
it
going
to
help
us
any
to
charge
it
all
to
the
tenant
who
herd
he
herds
because
he
has
no
other
chance
because
it
puts
money
into
some
one
pockets
to
let
him
we
never
yet
have
passed
a
law
for
his
relief
that
was
not
attacked
in
the
same
or
the
next
legislature
in
the
interest
of
the
builder
commission
after
commission
has
pointed
out
that
the
tenants
are
better
than
the
houses
they
live
in
that
they
respond
quickly
to
improved
conditions
those
are
not
honest
answers
the
man
who
talks
that
way
is
a
fool
or
worse
the
truth
is
that
if
we
can
not
stop
the
crowds
from
coming
we
make
homes
for
those
who
come
and
at
a
profit
on
the
investment
that
has
been
proved
is
being
proved
now
every
day
it
is
not
a
case
of
transforming
human
nature
in
the
tenant
but
of
reforming
it
in
the
landlord
builder
it
is
a
plain
question
of
the
per
cent
he
is
willing
to
take
so
then
we
have
got
it
on
the
moral
ground
where
it
belongs
let
the
capmaker
case
be
ever
so
strong
we
shall
yet
win
we
shall
win
his
fight
and
our
own
together
they
are
one
this
is
the
way
it
stands
at
the
outset
of
the
twentieth
century
new
york
housing
is
still
the
worst
in
the
world
we
have
the
biggest
crowds
we
have
been
killing
the
home
that
is
our
very
life
at
the
most
reckless
rate
but
badly
as
we
are
off
and
shall
be
off
for
years
to
come
allowing
even
that
we
are
getting
worse
off
in
the
matter
of
crowding
we
know
now
that
we
can
do
better
we
have
done
it
we
are
every
year
wresting
more
light
and
air
from
the
builder
he
no
longer
dares
come
out
and
fight
in
the
open
for
he
knows
that
public
sentiment
is
against
him
the
people
understand
to
what
an
extent
is
shown
in
a
report
of
a
tenement
house
committee
in
the
city
of
yonkers
which
the
postman
put
on
my
table
this
minute
the
committee
was
organized
to
prevent
the
danger
to
yonkers
of
incurring
the
same
evils
that
have
fallen
so
heavily
upon
new
york
and
have
cost
that
city
millions
of
money
and
thousands
of
lives
it
sprang
from
the
civic
league
was
appointed
by
a
republican
mayor
and
indorsed
by
a
democratic
council
that
is
as
it
should
be
so
we
shall
win
in
fact
we
are
winning
now
backed
by
this
very
understanding
the
is
doomed
and
the
lot
has
had
its
day
we
are
building
tenements
in
which
it
is
possible
to
rear
homes
we
are
at
last
in
a
fair
way
to
make
the
slum
unprofitable
and
that
is
the
only
way
to
make
it
go
so
that
we
may
speed
it
the
more
let
us
go
with
the
capmaker
a
while
and
get
his
point
of
view
after
all
that
is
the
one
that
counts
the
community
is
not
nearly
as
much
interested
in
the
profits
of
the
landlord
as
in
the
welfare
of
the
workers
that
we
may
get
it
fairly
suppose
we
take
a
stroll
through
a
neighborhood
and
see
for
ourselves
we
were
in
stanton
street
let
us
start
there
then
going
east
towering
barracks
on
either
side
five
six
stories
high
teeming
crowds
men
moved
on
by
the
policeman
who
seems
to
exist
only
for
the
purpose
forsyth
street
there
is
a
church
on
the
corner
polish
and
catholic
a
combination
that
strikes
one
as
queer
here
on
the
east
side
where
polish
has
come
to
be
synonymous
with
jewish
i
have
cause
to
remember
that
corner
a
man
killed
his
wife
in
this
house
and
was
hanged
for
it
just
across
the
street
on
the
stoop
of
that
tenement
the
tragedy
was
re√´nacted
the
next
year
only
the
murderer
saved
the
county
trouble
and
expense
by
taking
himself
off
also
that
other
stoop
in
the
same
row
witnessed
a
suicide
why
do
i
tell
you
these
things
because
they
are
true
the
policeman
here
will
bear
me
out
they
belong
to
the
ordinary
setting
of
life
in
a
crowd
such
as
this
it
is
never
so
little
worth
living
and
therefore
held
so
cheap
along
with
the
fierce
unceasing
battle
that
goes
on
to
save
it
you
will
go
no
further
unless
i
leave
it
out
very
well
i
shall
leave
out
the
murder
after
we
have
passed
the
block
yonder
the
tragedy
of
that
is
of
a
kind
that
comes
too
close
to
the
everyday
life
of
people
to
be
omitted
the
house
caught
fire
in
the
night
and
five
were
burned
to
death
father
mother
and
three
children
the
others
got
out
why
not
they
they
stayed
it
seems
to
make
sure
none
was
left
they
were
not
willing
to
leave
one
behind
to
save
themselves
and
then
it
was
too
late
the
stairs
were
burning
there
was
no
proper
fire
escape
that
was
where
the
murder
came
in
but
it
was
not
all
chargeable
to
the
landlord
nor
even
the
greater
part
more
than
thirty
years
ago
in
the
state
made
it
law
that
the
stairs
in
every
tenement
four
stories
high
should
be
fireproof
and
forbade
the
storing
of
any
inflammable
material
in
such
houses
i
do
not
know
when
the
law
was
repealed
or
if
it
ever
was
i
only
know
that
in
the
fire
department
out
of
pity
for
the
tenants
and
regard
for
the
safety
of
its
own
men
forced
through
an
amendment
to
the
building
law
requiring
the
stairs
of
the
common
type
of
tenements
to
be
built
of
fireproof
material
and
that
they
are
still
of
wood
just
as
they
always
were
per
cent
of
the
tenements
examined
by
the
late
tenement
house
commission
in
manhattan
had
stairs
of
wood
in
brooklyn
they
were
of
wood
once
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
looked
up
the
superintendent
of
buildings
and
asked
him
what
it
meant
i
showed
him
the
law
which
said
that
the
stairs
should
be
built
of
construction
or
fireproof
material
and
he
put
his
finger
upon
the
clause
that
follows
as
the
superintendent
of
buildings
shall
decide
the
law
gave
him
discretion
and
that
is
how
he
used
it
hard
wood
burns
slowly
said
he
the
fire
of
which
i
speak
was
a
cruller
fire
if
i
remember
rightly
which
is
to
say
that
it
broke
out
in
the
basement
bakeshop
where
they
were
boiling
crullers
doughnuts
in
fat
at
with
a
hundred
tenants
asleep
in
the
house
above
them
the
fat
went
into
the
fire
and
the
rest
followed
i
suppose
that
i
had
to
do
with
a
hundred
such
fires
as
a
police
reporter
before
under
the
protest
of
the
gilder
tenement
house
commission
and
the
good
government
clubs
the
boiling
of
fat
in
tenement
bakeshops
was
forbidden
the
chief
of
the
fire
department
in
his
testimony
before
the
commission
said
that
tenements
are
erected
mainly
with
a
view
of
returning
a
large
income
for
the
amount
of
capital
invested
it
is
only
after
a
fire
in
which
great
loss
of
life
occurs
that
any
interest
whatever
is
taken
in
the
safety
of
the
occupants
the
superintendent
of
buildings
after
such
a
fire
in
march
said
that
there
were
thousands
of
tenement
firetraps
in
the
city
my
notebook
bears
witness
to
the
correctness
of
his
statement
and
it
has
many
blank
leaves
that
are
waiting
to
be
put
to
that
use
yet
the
reckoning
for
eleven
years
showed
that
of
fires
in
new
york
per
cent
were
in
tenement
houses
though
they
were
only
a
little
more
than
per
cent
of
all
the
buildings
and
that
occupants
were
killed
maimed
and
rescued
by
the
firemen
their
rescue
cost
the
lives
of
three
of
these
brave
men
and
were
injured
in
the
effort
and
when
all
that
is
said
not
the
half
is
told
a
fire
in
the
night
in
one
of
those
human
beehives
with
its
terror
and
woe
is
one
of
the
things
that
live
in
the
recollection
ever
after
as
a
terrible
nightmare
the
thought
that
every
tenement
house
should
be
fireproof
but
he
warned
the
commission
that
such
a
proposition
would
meet
with
strong
opposition
from
the
different
interests
should
legislation
be
requested
he
was
right
it
is
purely
a
question
of
the
builder
profits
up
to
date
we
have
rescued
the
first
floor
from
him
that
must
be
fireproof
we
shall
get
the
whole
structure
yet
if
we
pull
long
enough
and
hard
enough
as
we
will
here
is
a
block
of
tenements
inhabited
by
poor
jews
most
of
the
jews
who
live
over
here
are
poor
and
the
poorer
they
are
the
higher
rent
do
they
pay
and
the
more
do
they
crowd
to
make
it
up
between
them
the
destruction
of
the
poor
is
their
poverty
it
is
only
the
old
story
in
a
new
setting
the
slum
landlord
profits
were
always
the
highest
he
spends
nothing
for
repairs
and
lays
the
blame
on
the
tenant
the
district
leader
saves
him
when
tammany
is
at
the
helm
unless
he
is
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
political
fence
in
which
case
the
sanitary
code
comes
handy
to
chase
him
into
camp
a
big
order
on
his
house
is
a
very
effective
way
of
making
a
landlord
discern
political
truth
on
the
eve
of
an
important
election
just
before
the
election
which
put
theodore
roosevelt
in
the
governor
chair
at
albany
the
sanitary
force
displayed
such
activity
as
had
never
been
known
till
then
in
the
examination
of
tenements
belonging
very
largely
as
it
happened
to
sympathizers
with
the
gallant
rough
rider
cause
and
those
who
knew
did
not
marvel
much
at
the
large
vote
polled
by
the
tammany
candidate
in
the
old
city
the
halls
of
these
tenements
are
dark
under
the
law
there
should
be
a
light
burning
but
it
is
one
of
the
rarest
things
to
find
one
the
thing
seems
impossible
of
accomplishment
when
the
good
government
clubs
set
about
backing
up
the
board
of
health
in
its
efforts
to
work
out
this
reform
which
comes
close
to
being
one
of
the
most
necessary
of
all
such
untold
mischief
is
abroad
in
the
darkness
of
these
thoroughfares
the
sanitary
police
reported
tenement
halls
unlighted
by
night
even
and
brought
them
by
repeated
orders
down
to
less
than
in
six
months
i
doubt
that
the
light
burned
in
of
them
all
a
month
after
the
election
that
brought
tammany
back
it
is
so
easy
to
put
it
out
when
the
policeman
back
is
turned
gas
costs
money
let
what
does
take
care
of
itself
we
had
a
curious
instance
at
the
time
of
the
difficulties
that
sometimes
beset
reform
certain
halls
that
were
known
to
be
dark
were
reported
sufficiently
lighted
by
the
policeman
of
the
district
and
it
was
discovered
that
it
was
his
standard
that
was
vitiated
he
himself
lived
in
a
tenement
and
was
used
to
its
gloom
so
an
order
was
issued
defining
darkness
to
the
sanitary
police
if
the
sink
in
the
hall
could
be
made
out
and
the
slops
overflowing
on
the
floor
and
if
a
baby
could
be
seen
on
the
stairs
the
hall
was
light
if
on
the
other
hand
the
baby
shrieks
were
the
first
warning
that
it
was
being
trampled
upon
the
hall
was
dark
some
days
later
the
old
question
arose
about
an
eldridge
street
tenement
the
policeman
had
reported
the
hall
light
enough
the
president
of
the
board
of
health
to
settle
it
once
for
all
went
over
with
me
to
see
for
himself
the
hall
was
very
dark
he
sent
for
the
policeman
did
you
see
the
sink
in
that
hall
he
asked
the
policeman
said
he
did
but
it
is
pitch
dark
how
did
you
see
it
i
lit
a
match
said
the
policeman
four
families
live
on
these
floors
with
heaven
knows
how
many
children
it
was
here
the
police
commissioners
were
requested
in
sober
earnest
some
years
ago
by
a
committee
of
very
practical
woman
philanthropists
to
have
the
children
tagged
as
they
do
in
japan
i
am
told
so
as
to
save
the
policeman
wear
and
tear
in
taking
them
back
and
forth
between
the
eldridge
street
police
station
and
headquarters
when
they
got
lost
if
tagged
they
could
be
assorted
at
once
and
taken
to
their
homes
incidentally
the
city
would
save
the
expense
of
many
meals
it
was
shrewdly
suspected
that
the
little
ones
were
lost
on
purpose
in
a
good
many
cases
as
a
way
of
getting
them
fed
at
the
public
expense
illustration
one
family
outlook
on
the
air
shaft
the
mother
said
our
daughter
does
not
care
to
come
home
to
sleep
that
the
children
preferred
the
excitement
of
the
police
station
and
the
distinction
of
a
trip
in
charge
of
a
guardian
to
the
ludlow
street
flat
is
easy
enough
to
understand
a
more
unlovely
existence
than
that
in
one
of
these
tenements
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
everywhere
is
the
stench
of
the
kerosene
stove
that
is
forever
burning
serving
for
cooking
heating
and
ironing
alike
until
the
last
atom
of
oxygen
is
burned
out
of
the
close
air
oil
is
cheaper
than
coal
the
air
shaft
is
too
busy
carrying
up
smells
from
below
to
bring
any
air
down
even
if
it
is
not
hung
full
of
washing
in
every
story
as
it
ordinarily
is
enterprising
tenants
turn
it
to
use
as
a
refrigerator
as
well
there
is
at
least
a
draught
of
air
such
as
it
is
when
fire
breaks
out
this
draught
makes
of
the
air
shaft
a
flue
through
which
the
fire
roars
fiercely
to
the
roof
so
transforming
what
was
meant
for
the
good
of
the
tenants
into
their
greatest
peril
the
stuffy
rooms
bring
to
mind
this
denunciation
of
the
tenement
builder
of
fifty
years
ago
by
an
angry
writer
he
measures
the
height
of
his
ceilings
by
the
shortest
of
the
people
and
by
thin
partitions
divides
the
interior
into
as
narrow
spaces
as
the
leanest
carpenter
can
work
in
most
decidedly
there
is
not
room
to
swing
the
proverbial
cat
in
any
one
of
them
in
one
i
helped
the
children
last
holiday
to
set
up
a
christmas
tree
so
that
a
glimpse
of
something
that
was
not
utterly
sordid
and
mean
might
for
once
enter
their
lives
three
weeks
after
i
found
the
tree
standing
yet
in
the
corner
it
was
very
cold
and
there
was
no
fire
in
the
room
we
were
going
to
burn
it
said
the
little
woman
whose
husband
was
then
in
the
insane
asylum
and
then
i
could
it
looked
so
kind
there
in
the
corner
my
tree
had
borne
the
fruit
i
wished
it
remained
for
the
new
york
slum
landlord
to
assess
the
exact
value
of
a
ray
of
sunlight
upon
the
tenant
of
course
here
are
two
rear
tenements
with
dark
bedrooms
on
the
south
the
flat
on
the
north
gives
upon
a
neighbor
yard
and
a
hole
two
feet
square
has
been
knocked
in
the
wall
letting
in
air
and
sunlight
little
enough
of
the
latter
but
what
there
is
is
carefully
computed
in
the
lease
six
dollars
for
this
flat
six
and
a
half
for
the
one
with
the
hole
in
the
wall
six
dollars
a
year
per
ray
in
half
a
dozen
houses
in
this
block
have
i
found
the
same
rate
maintained
the
modern
tenement
on
the
corner
goes
higher
for
four
front
rooms
where
the
sun
comes
right
in
your
face
seventeen
dollars
for
the
rear
flat
of
three
rooms
larger
and
better
every
other
way
but
always
dark
like
the
capmaker
eleven
dollars
from
the
landlord
point
of
view
this
last
is
probably
a
concession
but
he
is
a
landlord
with
a
heart
his
house
is
as
good
a
one
as
can
be
built
on
a
lot
the
man
who
owns
the
corner
building
in
orchard
street
with
the
two
adjoining
tenements
has
no
heart
in
the
depth
of
last
winter
i
found
a
family
of
poor
jews
living
in
a
coop
under
his
stairs
an
abandoned
piece
of
hallway
in
which
their
baby
was
born
and
for
which
he
made
them
pay
eight
dollars
a
month
it
was
the
most
outrageous
case
of
landlord
robbery
i
had
ever
come
across
and
it
gave
me
sincere
pleasure
to
assist
the
sanitary
policeman
in
curtailing
his
profits
by
even
this
much
the
hall
is
not
now
occupied
the
jews
under
the
stairs
had
two
children
the
shoemaker
in
the
cellar
next
door
had
three
they
were
fighting
and
snarling
like
so
many
dogs
over
the
coarse
food
on
the
table
before
them
when
we
looked
in
the
baby
it
seems
was
the
cause
of
the
row
he
wanted
it
all
he
was
a
very
dirty
and
a
very
fierce
baby
and
the
other
two
children
were
no
match
for
him
the
shoemaker
grunted
fretfully
at
his
last
ach
he
is
all
de
time
hungry
at
the
sight
of
the
policeman
the
young
imp
set
up
such
a
howl
that
we
beat
a
hasty
retreat
the
cellar
flat
was
undoubtedly
in
violation
of
law
but
it
was
allowed
to
pass
in
the
main
hall
on
the
ground
floor
we
counted
seventeen
children
the
facts
of
life
here
suspend
ordinary
landlord
prejudices
to
a
certain
extent
occasionally
it
is
the
tenant
who
suspends
them
the
policeman
laughed
as
he
told
me
of
the
case
of
a
mother
who
coveted
a
flat
into
which
she
well
knew
her
family
would
not
be
admitted
the
landlord
was
particular
she
knocked
with
a
troubled
face
alone
yes
the
flat
was
to
let
had
she
any
children
the
woman
heaved
a
sigh
six
but
they
are
all
in
greenwood
the
landlord
heart
was
touched
by
such
woe
he
let
her
have
the
flat
by
night
he
was
amazed
to
find
a
flock
of
half
a
dozen
robust
youngsters
domiciled
under
his
roof
they
had
indeed
been
in
greenwood
but
they
had
come
back
from
the
cemetery
to
stay
and
stay
they
did
the
rent
being
paid
high
rents
slack
work
and
low
wages
go
hand
in
hand
in
the
tenements
as
promoters
of
overcrowding
the
rent
is
always
of
the
family
income
often
more
the
fierce
competition
for
a
bare
living
cuts
down
wages
and
when
loss
of
work
is
added
the
only
thing
left
is
to
take
in
lodgers
to
meet
the
landlord
claim
the
jew
usually
takes
them
singly
the
italian
by
families
the
midnight
visit
of
the
sanitary
policeman
discloses
a
state
of
affairs
against
which
he
feels
himself
helpless
he
has
his
standard
cubic
feet
of
air
space
for
each
adult
sleeper
for
a
child
that
in
itself
is
a
concession
to
the
practical
necessities
of
the
case
the
original
demand
was
for
feet
but
of
and
odd
tenants
canvassed
in
new
york
in
the
slumming
investigation
prosecuted
by
the
general
government
in
were
found
to
have
less
than
feet
and
of
these
slept
in
unventilated
rooms
with
no
windows
no
more
such
rooms
have
been
added
since
but
there
has
come
that
which
is
worse
it
was
the
boast
of
new
york
till
a
few
years
ago
that
at
least
that
worst
of
tenement
depravities
the
house
too
familiar
in
the
english
slums
was
practically
unknown
here
it
is
not
so
any
longer
the
evil
began
in
the
old
houses
in
orchard
and
allen
streets
a
bad
neighborhood
infested
by
fallen
women
and
the
thievish
rascals
who
prey
upon
their
misery
a
region
where
the
whole
plan
of
humanity
if
plan
there
be
in
this
disgusting
mess
jars
out
of
tune
continually
the
house
has
become
an
institution
here
speeded
on
by
a
conscienceless
jew
who
bought
up
the
old
buildings
as
fast
as
they
came
into
the
market
and
filled
them
with
a
class
of
tenants
before
whom
charity
recoils
helpless
and
hopeless
when
the
houses
were
filled
the
crowds
overflowed
into
the
yard
in
one
i
found
in
midwinter
tenants
living
in
sheds
built
of
odd
boards
and
roof
tin
and
paying
a
dollar
a
week
for
herding
with
the
rats
one
of
them
a
german
was
a
philosopher
after
his
kind
he
did
not
trouble
himself
to
get
up
when
i
looked
in
but
stretched
himself
in
his
bed
it
was
high
noon
responding
to
my
sniff
of
disgust
that
it
was
sehr
schoen
ein
bischen
kalt
aber
was
his
neighbor
a
old
woman
begged
trembling
not
to
be
put
out
she
would
not
know
where
to
go
it
was
out
of
one
of
these
houses
that
fritz
meyer
the
murderer
went
to
rob
the
poor
box
in
the
redemptorist
church
the
night
when
he
killed
policeman
smith
the
policeman
surprised
him
at
his
work
in
the
room
he
had
occupied
i
came
upon
a
woman
with
a
black
eye
who
answered
the
question
of
the
officer
where
did
you
get
that
shiner
with
a
laugh
i
ran
up
against
the
fist
of
me
man
she
said
her
man
a
big
sullen
lout
sat
by
dumb
the
woman
answered
for
him
that
he
was
a
mechanic
what
does
he
work
at
snorted
the
policeman
restraining
himself
with
an
effort
from
kicking
the
fellow
she
laughed
scornfully
at
the
junk
business
it
meant
that
he
was
a
thief
young
men
with
blotched
faces
and
cadaverous
looks
were
loafing
in
every
room
they
hung
their
heads
in
silence
the
women
turned
their
faces
away
at
the
sight
of
the
uniform
they
cling
to
these
wretches
who
exploit
their
starved
affections
for
their
own
ease
with
a
grip
of
desperation
it
is
their
last
hold
women
have
to
love
something
it
is
their
deepest
degradation
that
they
must
love
these
even
the
wretches
themselves
feel
the
shame
of
it
and
repay
them
by
beating
and
robbing
them
as
their
daily
occupation
a
poor
little
baby
in
one
of
the
rooms
gave
a
shuddering
human
touch
to
it
all
the
old
houses
began
it
as
they
began
all
the
tenement
mischief
that
has
come
upon
new
york
but
the
opportunity
that
was
made
by
the
tenant
need
was
not
one
to
be
neglected
in
some
of
the
newer
tenements
with
their
smaller
rooms
the
lodger
is
by
this
time
provided
for
in
the
plan
with
a
special
entrance
from
the
hall
lodger
comes
by
an
easy
transition
to
stand
for
family
one
winter
night
i
went
with
the
sanitary
police
on
their
midnight
inspection
through
a
row
of
elizabeth
street
tenements
which
i
had
known
since
they
were
built
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
ago
that
is
the
neighborhood
in
which
the
recent
italian
immigrants
crowd
in
the
house
which
we
selected
for
examination
in
all
respects
the
type
of
the
rest
we
found
families
where
there
should
have
been
sixteen
upon
each
floor
were
four
flats
and
in
each
flat
three
rooms
that
measured
respectively
and
feet
in
only
one
flat
did
we
find
a
single
family
in
three
there
were
two
to
each
in
the
other
twelve
each
room
had
its
own
family
living
and
sleeping
there
they
cooked
i
suppose
at
the
one
stove
in
the
kitchen
which
was
the
largest
room
in
one
big
bed
we
counted
six
persons
the
parents
and
four
children
two
of
them
lay
crosswise
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
or
there
would
not
have
been
room
a
curtain
was
hung
before
the
bed
in
each
of
the
two
smaller
rooms
leaving
a
passageway
from
the
hall
to
the
room
with
the
windows
the
rent
for
the
front
flats
was
twelve
dollars
for
that
in
the
rear
ten
dollars
the
social
distinctions
going
with
the
advantage
of
location
were
rigidly
observed
i
suppose
the
three
steps
across
a
tenement
hall
from
the
front
to
the
back
are
often
a
longer
road
than
from
ludlow
street
to
fifth
avenue
they
were
sweaters
tenements
but
i
shall
keep
that
end
of
the
story
until
i
come
to
speak
of
the
tenants
the
houses
i
have
in
mind
now
they
were
astor
leasehold
property
and
i
had
seen
them
built
upon
the
improved
plan
of
with
air
shafts
and
all
that
there
had
not
been
water
in
the
tenements
for
a
month
then
we
were
told
by
the
one
tenant
who
spoke
english
that
could
be
understood
the
cold
snap
had
locked
the
pipes
fitly
enough
the
lessee
was
an
undertaker
an
italian
himself
who
combined
with
his
business
of
housing
his
people
above
and
below
the
ground
also
that
of
the
padrone
to
let
no
profit
slip
he
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
make
many
or
recent
repairs
the
buildings
had
made
a
fair
start
they
promised
well
but
the
promise
had
not
been
kept
in
their
premature
decay
they
were
distinctly
as
bad
as
the
worst
i
had
the
curiosity
to
seek
out
the
agent
the
middleman
and
ask
him
why
they
were
so
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
such
tenants
nothing
could
be
done
he
said
i
have
always
held
that
italians
are
most
manageable
and
that
with
all
the
surface
indications
to
the
contrary
they
are
really
inclined
to
cleanliness
if
cause
can
be
shown
and
i
told
him
so
he
changed
the
subject
diplomatically
no
doubt
it
was
with
him
simply
a
question
of
the
rent
they
might
crowd
and
carry
on
as
they
pleased
once
that
was
paid
and
they
did
it
used
to
be
the
joke
of
elizabeth
street
that
when
the
midnight
police
came
the
tenants
would
keep
them
waiting
outside
pretending
to
search
for
the
key
until
the
surplus
population
of
men
had
time
to
climb
down
the
when
the
police
were
gone
they
came
back
we
surprised
them
all
in
bed
like
most
of
the
other
tenements
we
have
come
across
on
our
trip
these
were
that
is
the
type
of
tenement
that
is
responsible
for
the
crowding
that
till
now
has
gone
on
unchecked
for
twenty
years
it
has
been
replacing
the
older
barracks
everywhere
as
fast
as
they
rotted
or
were
torn
down
this
was
thus
described
by
the
tenement
house
commission
of
it
is
the
one
hopeless
form
of
tenement
construction
it
can
not
be
well
ventilated
it
can
not
be
well
lighted
it
is
not
safe
in
case
of
fire
it
is
built
on
a
lot
feet
wide
by
or
less
in
depth
with
apartments
for
four
families
in
each
story
this
necessitates
the
occupation
of
from
to
per
cent
of
the
lot
depth
the
stairway
made
in
the
centre
of
the
house
and
the
necessary
walls
and
partitions

the
width
of
the
middle
rooms
which
serve
as
bedrooms
for
at
least
two
people
each
to

each
at
the
most
and
a
narrow
light
and

shaft
now
legally
required
in
the
centre
of
each
side

still
further
lessens
the

is
only
possible
for
the

and

the

must
borrow
what
light
they
can
from
dark
hallways
the
shallow
shafts
and
the
rear

their
air
must
pass
through
other
rooms
or
the
tiny
shafts
and
can
not
but
be
contaminated
before
it
reaches
them
a
house
of
this
character
contains
apartments
for
eighteen
or
twenty
families
a
population
frequently
amounting
to
people
and
sometimes
increased
by
boarders
or
lodgers
to
or
more
illustration
the
only
in
the
block
it
hangs
in
the

the
commission
after
looking
in
vain
through
the
slums
of
the
old
world
cities
for
something
to
compare
the
with
declared
that
in
their
setting
the
separateness
and
sacredness
of
home
life
were
interfered
with
and
evils
bred
physical
and
moral
that
conduce
to
the
corruption
of
the
young
make
for
unrighteousness
said
the
commission
of
six
years
later
yet
it
is
for
these
that
the
interests
of
which
the
spoke
have
rushed
into
battle
at
almost
every
session
of
the
legislature
whenever
a
step
was
taken
to
arraign
them
before
the
bar
of
public
opinion
no
winter
has
passed
since
the
awakening
conscience
of
the
people
of
new
york
city
manifested
itself
in
a
desire
to
better
the
lot
of
the
other
half
that
has
not
seen
an
assault
made
in
one
shape
or
another
on
the
structure
of
law
built
up
with
such
anxious
solicitude
once
a
bill
to
exempt
from
police
supervision
by
withdrawing
them
from
the
class
the
very
worst
of
the
houses
whose
threatened
the
community
was
sneaked
through
the
legislature
all
unknown
and
had
reached
the
executive
before
the
alarm
was
sounded
the
governor
put
upon
his
guard
returned
the
bill
with
the
indorsement
that
he
was
unable
to
understand
what
could
have
prompted
a
measure
that
seemed
to
have
reason
and
every
argument
against
it
and
none
for
it
but
the
motive
is
not
so
obscure
after
all
it
is
the
same
old
one
of
profit
without
conscience
it
took
from
the
health
department
the
supervision
of
the
light
ventilation
and
plumbing
of
the
tenements
which
by
right
belonged
there
and
put
it
in
charge
of
a
compliant
building
department
for
the
convenience
of
architects
and
their
clients
and
the
saving
of
time
and
expense
to
them
for
the
convenience
of
the
architect
client
the
builder
the
lot
was
encroached
upon
until
of
one
big
block
which
the
gilder
commission
measured
only
per
cent
was
left
open
to
the
air
per
cent
of
it
was
covered
with
brick
and
mortar
rear
tenements
to
the
number
of
nearly
have
been
condemned
as
with
good
reason
but
this
block
was
built
practically
solid
the
average
of
space
covered
in
tenement
blocks
was
shown
to
be
per
cent
the
law
allowed
only
the
discretion
that
penned
tenants
in
a
burning
tenement
with
stairs
of
wood
for
the
builder
convenience
cut
down
the
chance
of
life
of
their
babies
unmoved
sunlight
and
air
mean
just
that
where
three
thousand
human
beings
are
packed
into
a
single
block
that
was
why
the
matter
was
given
into
the
charge
of
the
health
officials
when
politics
was
yet
kept
out
of
their
work
illustration
the
old
style
of
tenements
with
yards
of
such
kind
are
the
interests
that
oppose
betterment
of
the
hard
lot
in
new
york
that
dictated
the
appointment
by
tammany
of
a
commission
composed
of
builders
to
revise
its
code
of
tenement
laws
and
that
sneered
at
the
laughable
results
of
the
gilder
tenement
house
commission
those
results
made
for
the
health
and
happiness
and
safety
of
a
million
and
a
half
of
souls
and
were
accounted
on
every
humane
ground
the
longest
step
forward
that
had
been
taken
by
this
community
for
the
old
absentee
landlord
who
did
not
know
what
mischief
was
afoot
we
have
got
the
speculative
builder
who
does
know
but
does
not
care
so
long
as
he
gets
his
pound
of
flesh
half
of
the
just
laws
that
have
been
passed
for
the
relief
of
the
people
he
has
paralyzed
with
his
treacherous
discretion
clause
carefully
nursed
in
the
school
of
practical
politics
to
which
he
gives
faithful
adherence
the
thing
has
been
the
curse
of
our
city
from
the
day
when
the
earliest
struggle
toward
better
things
began
among
the
first
manifestations
of
that
was
the
prohibition
of
soap
factories
below
grand
street
by
the
act
of
which
created
a
board
of
health
with
police
powers
the
act
was
passed
in
february
to
take
effect
in
july
but
long
before
that
time
the
same
legislature
had
amended
it
by
giving
the
authorities
discretion
in
the
matter
and
the
biggest
soap
factory
of
them
all
is
down
there
to
this
day
and
is
even
now
stirring
up
a
rumpus
among
the
latest
immigrants
the
syrians
who
have
settled
about
it
no
doubt
it
is
all
a
question
of
political
education
but
is
not
a
hundred
years
enough
to
settle
this
much
that
compromise
is
out
of
place
where
the
lives
of
the
people
are
at
stake
and
that
it
is
time
our
years
of
discretion
were
numbered
illustration
as
a
solid
block
of
lawful
until
now
would
appear
at
last
there
comes
for
the
answer
an
emphatic
yes
this
year
the
law
has
killed
the
discretionary
clause
and
spoken
out
plainly
no
more

no
more

here

in

a
wide
open

yet
to
be
a
real
park
with
flowers
and
grass
and
birds
to
gladden
the
hearts
of
those
to
whom
such
things
have
been
as
tales

are
told
all
these
dreary
years

the
children

yonder
big
school
may
roam
at

undismayed

now

we
shall
hear
the
story
of

parks

rejoice
that
the
day
of
reckoning
is
coming
for
the
builder

him
deck
the

roaming
through
the
british
museum
i
came
upon
an
exhibit
that
riveted
my
attention
as
nothing
else
had
it
was
a
huge
stone
arm
torn
from
the
shoulder
of
some
rock
image
with
doubled
fist
and
every
rigid
muscle
instinct
with
angry
menace
where
it
came
from
or
what
was
its
story
i
do
not
know
i
did
not
ask
it
was
its
message
to
us
i
was
trying
to
read
i
had
been
spending
weary
days
and
nights
in
the
slums
of
london
where
hatred
grew
a
noxious
crop
upon
the
wreck
of
the
home
lying
there
mute
and
menacing
the
great
fist
seemed
to
me
like
a
shadow
thrown
from
the
gray
dawn
of
the
race
into
our
busy
day
with
a
purpose
a
grim
unheeded
warning
what
was
it
in
the
slum
the
question
haunts
me
yet
they
perished
the
empires
those
built
and
the
governments
reared
upon
their
ruins
are
long
since
dead
and
forgotten
they
were
born
to
die
for
they
were
not
built
upon
human
happiness
but
upon
human
terror
and
greed
we
built
ours
upon
the
bed
rock
and
its
cornerstone
is
the
home
with
this
bitter
mockery
of
it
that
makes
the
slum
can
it
be
that
the
warning
is
indeed
for
us
chapter

i
stood
at
seven
dials
and
heard
the
policeman
account
of
what
it
used
to
be
seven
dials
is
no
more
like
the
slum
of
old
than
is
the
five
points
the
conscience
of
london
wrought
upon
the

as
the
conscience
of

other

house
a

two

schools
and
hard
by

and

the

of
the
battle
with

with
these
forces

field
has

the

story
rambled
among
the
days
when
things
were
different
then
it
was
dangerous
for
an
officer
to
go
alone
there
at
night
around
the
corner
there
came
from
one
of
the
side
streets
a
procession
with
banners
parading
in
honor
and
aid
of
some
church
charity
we
watched
it
pass
in
it
marched
young
men
and
boys
with
swords
and
and
upon
its
outskirts
skipped
a
host
of
young
roughs
so
one
would
have
called
them
but
for
the
evidence
of
their
honest
employment
who
rattled
collection
boxes
reaping
a
harvest
of
pennies
from
far
and
near
i
looked
at
the
and
the
collection
boxes
and
thought
of
forty
years
ago
where
was
the
seven
dials
of
that
day
and
the
men
who
gave
it
its
bad
name
i
asked
the
policeman
they
were
druv

sor
he
said
and
answered
from
his
own
experience
the
question
ever
asked
by
philanthropists
my
father
he
done
duty
here
afore
me
in
the
worst
dive
was
where
that
church
stands
it
was
always
full
of
thieves
whose
sons
i
added
mentally
have
become
collectors
for
the
church
the
one
fact
was
a
whole

on

had

outweighed
a
bushel
of
arguments
it
was
all
very
well
to
build
model
tenements
as
object
lessons
to
show
that
the
thing
could
be
done
it
had
become
necessary
to
enforce
the
lesson
by
demonstrating
that
the
community
had
power
to
destroy
houses
which
were
a
menace
to
its
life
the
rear
tenements
were
chosen
for
this
purpose
they
were
the
worst
as
they
were
the
first
of
new
york
tenements
the
of
which
i
have
spoken
had
with
all
their
evils
at
least
this
to
their
credit
that
their
was
not
nearly
as
high
as
that
of
the
old
houses
that
was
not
because
of
any
virtue
inherent
in
the
but
because
the
earlier
tenements
were
old
and
built
in
a
day
that
knew
nothing
of
sanitary
restrictions
and
cared
less
hence
the
showing
that
the
big
tenements
had
much
the
lowest
mortality
the
does
not
sound
the
depths
of
evils
but
it
makes
a
record
that
is
needed
when
it
comes
to
attacking
property
rights
the
mortality
of
the
rear
tenements
had
long
been
a
scandal
they
are
built
in
the
back
yard
generally
back
to
back
with
the
rear
buildings
on
abutting
lots
if
there
is
an
open
space
between
them
it
is
never
more
than
a
slit
a
foot
or
so
wide
and
gets
to
be
the
receptacle
of
garbage
and
filth
of
every
kind
so
that
any
opening
made
in
these
walls
for
purposes
of
ventilation
becomes
a
source
of
greater
danger
than
if
there
were
none
the
last
count
that
was
made
in
showed
that
among
the
tenements
in
manhattan
and
the
bronx
there
were
still
rear
houses
left
where
they
are
the
rises
for
reasons
that
are
apparent
the
sun
can
not
reach
them
they
are
damp
and
dark
and
the
tenants
who
are
always
the
poorest
and
most
crowded
live
as
in
a
cage
open
only
toward
the
front
a
canvass
made
of
the
mortality

roger
tracy

a
still
better
test
that
rose
from
in
the
single
tenements
of
the
same
ward
to
where
there
were
rear
houses
one
in
every
five
babies
had
to
die
that
is
to
say
the
house
killed
it
no
wonder
the
gilder
commission
styled
the
rear
tenements
and
called
upon
the
legislature
to
root
them
out
and
with
them
every
old
ramshackle
tenement
in
the

a

act

destroying

property
was
passed
in
the
spring
of
it
provided
for
the
seizure
of
buildings
that
were
dangerous
to
the
public
health
or
unfit
for
human
habitation
and
their
destruction
upon
proper
proof
with
compensation
to
the
owner
on
a
sliding
scale
down
to
the
point

entire
unfitness
when
he
might
claim
only
the
value
of
the
material
in
his
house
up
to
that
time
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
such
a
house
had
been
to
declare
it
a
nuisance
under
the
sanitary
code
but
as
the
city
could
not
very
well
pay
for
the
removal
of
a
nuisance
to
order
it
down
seemed
too
much
like
robbery
so
the
owner
was
allowed
to
keep
it
it
takes
time
and
a
good
many
lives
to
grow
a
sentiment
such
as
this
law
expressed
the
respect
for
vested
rights
is
strong
in
us
also
i
remember
going
through
a
ragged
school
in
london
once
and
finding
the
eyes
of
the
children
in
the
infant
class
red
and
sore
suspecting
some
contagion
i
made
inquiries
and
was
told
that
a

on

that

i

that
in

i
carried

i
had
just
been
reading
a
plea
of
some
honorable
for
a
reform
in
the
system
of
counsel
fees
then
being
agitated
in
the
house
of
commons
the
reply
of
the
solicitor
general
had
made
me
laugh
he
was
inclined
to
agree
with
the
honorable
member
but
still
preferred
to
follow
precedent
by
referring
the
matter
to
the
inns
of
court
quite
incidentally
he
mentioned
that
the
matter
had
been
hanging
fire
in
the
house
two
hundred
years
it
seemed
very
english
to
me
then
but
when
we
afterward
came
to
tackle
our
rear
tenements
and
in
the
first
batch
there
was
a
row
which
i
knew
to
have
been
picked
out
by
the
sanitary
inspector
years
before
as
fit
only
to
be
destroyed

recognized

nobody
was
afraid
of
the

the

kept
a
list
of

with

of

in
which
there
had
been
deaths
in
a
little
over
five

we

our

drove

the
owners
went

all
but
to
their
surprise

the

held
with

was

as
fundamental
one
that
charity
that

not

the
other
that
nothing

any

reckon

of

capital
stock
of
the
city

suburban

company
and
upon
these
was
erected
the
first
block
of
tenements
this
is
the
neighborhood
toward
which
the
population
has
been
setting
with
ever
increasing
congestion

figures
in
the

showed
a
crowding
of

persons

of

where
the
conditions

be
reproduced

indeed
they
are
not

fifteenth

on
the

line
the
first
sociological
canvass

had
found
the

educational
agencies
marshalling
a
frontage
of
feet
on
the
street
while
the
saloon
fronts
stretched
themselves
over
nearly
a
mile
so
that
said
the
compiler
of
these
pregnant
facts
saloon
social
ideals
are
minting
themselves
on
the
minds
of
the
people
at
the
ratio
of
seven
saloon
thoughts
to

thought
it
would
not

buildings
as
they
were
called
in
recognition
of
the
effort
of
this
woman
have
at
this
writing
been
occupied
five
years
they
harbor
nearly
four
hundred
families
as
contented
a
lot
as
i
ever
saw
anywhere
the
one
tenant
who
left
in
disgust
was
a
young
doctor
who
had
settled
on
the
estate
thinking
he
could
pick
up
a
practice
among
so
many
but
he
could
they
were
not
often
sick
those
tenants
last
year
only
three
died
and
they
were
all
killed
while
away
from
home
so
he
had
good
cause
of
complaint
the
rest
had
none
and
having
none
they
stay
which
is
no
mean
blow
struck
for
the
home
in
the
battle
with
the
slum
the
home
feeling
can
never
grow
where
people
do
not
stay
long
enough
to
feel
at
home
any
more
than
the
plant
can
which
the
child
is
pulling
up
every
two
or
three
days
to
see
if
it
has
roots
half
the
tenement
house
population
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
ought
not
to
say
the
whole
of
it
is
everlastingly
on
the
move
gould
quotes
as
an
instance
of
it
the
experience
of
an
assembly
district
leader
in
distributing
political
circulars
among
the
people
in
a
good
tenement
neighborhood
in
three
months
after
the
enrolment
lists
had
been
made
out
of
the
tenants
had
moved
no
doubt
the
experience
was
typical
how
can
the
one
who
hardly
knows
what
a
home
means
be
expected
to
have
any
pride
or
interest
in
his
home
in
the
larger
sense
the
city
and
to
what
in
such
men
is
one
to
appeal
in
the
interests
of
civic
betterment
that
is
why
every
effort
that
goes
to
help
tie
the
citizen
to
one
spot
long
enough
to
give
him
the
proprietary
sense
in
it
which
is
the
first
step
toward
civic
interest
and
pride
is
of
such
account
it
is
one
way
in
which
the
public
schools
as
neighborhood
houses
in
the
best
sense
could
be
of
great
help
and
a
chief
factor
in
the
success
of
the
social
settlement
and
that
is
why
model
tenements
which
pay
and
foster
the
home
give
back
more
than
a
money
interest
to
the
community
they
must
pay
for
else
as
i
said
they
will
not
stay
these
pay
four
per
cent
and
are
expected
to
pay
five
the
company
limit
so
it
is
not
strange
that
the
concern
has
prospered
it
has
since
raised
more
than
one
million
of
dollars
and
has
built
another
block
with
room
for
families
on
first
avenue
and
on
and
streets
within
hail
of
battle
row
of
anciently
warlike
memory
still
another
block
is
going
up
at
avenue
a
and
street
and
in
west
street
where
the
colored
population
crowds
the
company
is
erecting
two
buildings
for
negro
tenants
where
they
will
live
as
well
as
their
white
fellows
do
in
model
tenements
a
act
of
justice
for
as
far
back
as
any
one
can
remember
the
colored
man
has
been
paying
more
and
getting
less
for
his
money
in
new
york
than
whites
of
the
same
grade
who
are
poorer
tenants
every
way
the
company
city
homes
come
as
near
being
that
as
any
can
there
is
light
and
air
in
abundance
steam
heat
in
winter
in
the
latest
ones
fireproof
stairs
and
deadened
partitions
to
help
on
the
privacy
that
is
at
once
the
most
needed
and
hardest
to
get
in
a
tenement
the
houses
do
not
look
like
barracks
any
one
who
has
ever
seen
a
row
of
factory
tenements
that
were
just
houses
not
homes
will
understand
how
much
that
means
i
can
think
of
some
such
rows
now
with
their
ugly
brick
fronts
straight
up
and
down
without
a
break
and
without
a
vine
or
a
of
greens
or
flowers
and
the
mere
thought
of
them
gives
me
the
blues
for
the
rest
of
the
day
there
is
nothing
of
that
about
these
tenements
unless
it
be
the
long
between
the
buildings
in
and
streets
it
is
too
narrow
to
have
anything
in
it
but
asphalt
but
the
rest
makes
up
for
it
in
part
all
together
the
company
has
redeemed
its
promise
of
real
model
tenements
and
it
has
had
no
trouble
with
its
tenants
the
few
and
simple
rules
are
readily
understood
as
being
for
the
general
good
and
so
obeyed
it
is
the
old
story
told
years
and
years
ago
by
alfred
white
when
he
had
built
his
riverside
tenements
in
brooklyn
the
tenants
do
not
have
to
come
up
to
the
landlord
standard
they
are
more
than
abreast
of
him
in
his
utmost
endeavor
if
he
will
only
use
common
sense
in
the
management
of
his
property
they
do
that
in
the
city
and
suburban
homes
company
buildings
they
give
their
tenants
and
a
friend
for
a
their
children
playrooms
and
christmas
parties
and
the
whole
neighborhood
feels
the
stimulus
of
the
new
and
humane
plan
in
all
battle
row
there
has
not
been
a
scrap
let
alone
an
shindy
since
the
accommodation
flats
came
upon
the
scene
that
is
what
they
call
them
it
is
an
everyday
observation
that
the
row
has
come
up
since
some
of
the
old
houses
have
been
remodelled
the
new
that
are
being
built
aim
visibly
toward
the
higher
standard
the
company
rents
average
a
dollar
a
week
per
room
and
are
a
trifle
higher
than
those
of
the
old
tenements
round
about
but
they
have
so
much
more
in
the
way
of
comfort
that
the
money
is
eagerly
paid
nor
is
the
difference
so
great
that
the
picking
of
tenants
amounts
to
more
than
the
putting
of
a
premium
on
steadiness
sobriety
and
cleanliness
which
in
itself
is
a
service
to
render
one
experience
of
the
management
which
caused
some
astonishment
but
upon
reflection
was
accepted
as
an
encouraging
sign
was
the
refusal
of
the
tenants
to
use
the
common
in
the
laundry
they
are
little
used
to
this
day
the
women
will
use
the
drying
racks
but
they
object
to
rubbing
elbows
with
their
neighbors
while
they
wash
their
clothes
it
is
after
all
a
sign
that
the
tenement
that
smothers
individuality
left
them
this
useful
handle
and
if
the
experience
squashed
the
hopes
of
some
who
dreamed
of
municipal
on
the
glasgow
plan
there
is
nothing
to
grieve
over
every
peg
of
personal
pride
rescued
from
the
tenement
is
worth
a
thousand
theories
for
hanging
the
hope
of
improvement
on
with
invested
by
this
time
the
company
has
built
city
homes
for
families
and
has
only
made
a
beginning
all
the
money
that
is
needed
for
going
on
with
its
work
is
in
sight
nor
are
the
rich
the
only
investors
of
the
stockholders
have
small
lots
ten
shares
and
less
each
a
healthy
sign
that
the
company
is
holding
the
confidence
of
the
community
it
has
fairly
earned
it
no
one
could
have
done
a
greater
and
better
thing
for
the
metropolis
than
to
demonstrate
that
it
is
possible
to
build
homes
for
the
toilers
as
a
business
and
net
a
business
interest
upon
the
investment
the
statement
is
emphasized
by
the
company
experience
with
the
suburban
end
of
its
work
it
bought
sites
for
two
or
three
hundred
little
cottages
out
on
long
island
but
within
the
greater
city
and
only
half
an
hour
by
trolley
or
elevated
from
the
city
hall
a
hundred
houses
were
built
neat
and
cosey
homes
of
brick
and
timber
each
in
its
own
garden
and
a
plan
was
devised
under
which
the
purchaser
had
twenty
years
to
pay
for
the
property
a
life
insurance
policy
protected
the
seller
and
secured
the
house
to
the
widow
should
the
breadwinner
die
the
plan
has
worked
well
in
belgium
under
the
eyes
of
the
government
but
it
failed
to
attract
buyers
here
of
those
whom
it
did
attract
at
the
outset
not
a
few
have
given
up
and
gone
away
when
i
went
out
to
have
a
look
at
the
place
the
year
after
homewood
had
been
settled
houses
had
found
owners
under
the
company
plans
after
four
years
only
are
so
held
ten
have
been
bought
outright
and
three
sold
under
contract
practically
the
company
has
had
to
give
up
its
plan
and
rent
as
many
of
the
houses
as
it
could
nine
were
vacant
this
last
spring
so
what
we
all
thought
the
way
out
of
the
slum
seems
barred
for
the
time
being
for
there
is
no
other
explanation
of
the
failure
than
that
the
people
will
not
go
among
the
stumps
lack
of
facilities
for
getting
there
played
a
part
possibly
but
a
minor
one
and
now
there
is
no
such
grievance
the
simple
fact
is
that
the
that
makes
a
man
rear
a
home
upon
the
soil
as
the
chief
ambition
of
his
life
was
not
there
the
tenement
and
the
flat
have
weakened
that
peg
among
the
class
of
workers
for
whom
homewood
was
planned
i
hate
to
say
that
they
have
broken
the
peg
for
i
do
not
believe
it
but
it
has
been
hurt
without
doubt
they
longed
for
the
crowds
the
grass
and
the
trees
and
the
birds
and
the
salt
breath
of
the
sea
did
not
speak
to
them
in
a
language
they
understood
the
brass
bands
and
the
the
street
cries
and
the
rush
and
roar
of
the
city
had
made
them
forget
their
tongue
for
the
children
understood
even
in
the
gutter
it
means
i
suppose
said
gould
to
me
when
we
had
talked
it
all
over
that
we
are
and
always
shall
be
a
tenement
house
city
and
that
we
have
got
to
reckon
with
and
plan
for
that
only
i
think
not
i
believe
he
is
mistaken
and
yet
i
can
give
no
other
ground
for
my
belief
than
my
unyielding
faith
that
things
will
come
right
yet
if
it
does
take
time
they
are
not
right
as
they
are
man
is
not
made
to
be
born
and
to
live
all
his
life
in
a
box
packed
away
with
his
fellows
like
so
many
herring
in
a
barrel
he
is
here
in
this
world
for
something
that
is
not
attained
in
that
way
but
is
if
not
attained
at
least
perceived
when
the
daisies
and
the
robins
come
in
if
to
help
men
perceive
it
is
all
we
can
do
in
our
generation
that
is
a
good
deal
but
i
believe
that
before
our
children
have
come
to
the
divide
perhaps
before
we
are
gone
we
shall
see
the
tide
of
the
last
century
drift
to
the
cities
turn
under
the
impulse
of
the
new
forces
that
are
being
harnessed
for
man
work
and
homewood
come
to
its
rights
i
say
i
believe
it
i
wish
i
could
say
i
knew
but
then
you
would
ask
for
my
proofs
and
i
have
any
for
all
that
i
still
believe
it
meanwhile
gould
advice
is
good
sense
if
he
is
right
it
is
of
the
last
importance
if
i
am
right
it
is
still
the
way
to
proving
me
so
by
holding
on
to
what
is
left
of
the
home
in
the
tenement
and
making
the
most
of
it
that
we
have
taken
the
advice
is
good
ground
for
hope
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
new
york
has
still
the
worst
housing
in
the
world
we
can
now
destroy
what
is
not
fit
to
stand
we
have
done
it
and
the
republic
yet
survives
the
slum
landlord
would
have
had
us
believe
that
it
must
perish

his
rookeries
we
are
building
model
tenements
and
making
them
pay
alfred
white
riverside
tenements
are
as
good
as
when
they
were
built
a
dozen
years
ago
better
if
anything
for
they
were
honestly
built
and
in
all
that
time
they
have
paid
five
and
six
per
cent
and
even
more
gould
found
that
only
six
per
cent
of
all
the
great
model
housing
operations
which
he
examined
for
the
government
here
and
abroad
had
failed
to
pay
all
the
rest
were
successful
and
by
virtue
of
the
showing
we
have
taken
the
lot
itself
by
the
throat
three
years
ago
speaking
of
it
as
the
one
thing
that
was
in
the
way
of
progress
in
new
york
i
wrote
it
will
continue
to
be
in
the
way
a
man
who
has
one
lot
will
build
on
it
it
is
his
right
the
state
which
taxes
his
lot
has
no
right
to
confiscate
it
by
forbidding
him
to
make
it
yield
him
an
income
on
the
plea
that
he
might
build
something
which
would
be
a
nuisance
but
it
can
so
order
the
building
that
it
shall
not
be
a
nuisance
that
is
not
only
its
right
but
its
duty
illustration
the
riverside
tenements
in
brooklyn
that
duty
has
been
done
since
let
me
tell
how
popular
sentiment
taking
more
and
more
firmly
hold
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
direct
connection
between
helpless
poverty
and
bad
housing
shaped
itself
in
into
a
volunteer
tenement
house
committee
which
as
an
effective
branch
of
the
charity
organization
society
drew
up
and
presented
to
the
municipal
authorities
a
reform
code
of
building
ordinances
affecting
the
dwellings
of
the
poor
but
tammany
was
back
and
they
would
not
listen
at
the
city
hall
seeing
which
the
committee
made
up
its
mind
to
appeal
to
the
people
themselves
in
such
fashion
that
it
should
be
heard
that
was
the
way
the
tenement
house
exhibition
of
the
winter
of
came
into
existence
rich
and
poor
came
to
see
that
speaking
record
of
a
city
sorry
plight
and
at
last
we
all
understood
not
to

would
rather
we

learned

the

governing
ourselves

came
near
saying
i

from
the
day
they
should
have
been
opened
and
two
stalwart
watchmen
drew
salaries
for
sitting
in
the

to
keep
the
people
out
that
was
a
perfectly
characteristic
use
of
the
people
money
and
is
not
lightly
to
be
invited
back
rather
wait
awhile
yet
and
see
what
our
bridges
and
real
rapid
transit
and
the
philanthropy
and
five
per

plan
will
do
for
us
when
that
latter
has
been
grasped
so
by
the
tenant
that
a
little
extra
brass
and
does
not
tempt
him
over
into
the
enemy
camp
the
usurious
rents
may
yet
follow
the
as
they
have
clung
to
it
in
the
past
but
if
the
city
may
not
be
the
landlord
of
tenements
i
have
often
thought
it
might
with
advantage
manage
them
to
the
extent
of
building
them
to
contain
so
many
tenements
on
basis
of
air
space
and
no
more
the
thing
was
proposed
when
the
tenement
house
question
first
came
up
for
discussion
but
was
dropped
then
the
last
tenement
house
commission
considered
it
carefully
but
decided
to
wait
and
see
first
how
the
new
department
worked
the
whole
expense
of
that
with
its
nearly
two
hundred
inspectors
might
easily
be
borne
by
the
collection
of
a
license
fee
so
small
that
even
the
tenement
house
landlord
could
not
complain
lodging
houses
are
licensed
and
workshops
in
the
tenements
likewise
to
secure
efficient
control
of
them
if
that
is
not
secured
in
the
case
of
the
workshops
as
it
is
not
it
is
no
fault
of
the
plan
but
of
the
working
out
of
it
i
do
not
expect
the
licensing
of
tenements
to
dispose
of
all
the
evils
in
them
no
law
or
system
will
ever
do
that
but
it
ought
to
make
it
easier
to
get
the
grip
on
them
that
has
been
wanting
heretofore

our
hurt

my
revenge
some

my

will
read
his

story
himself

i
hope
will
not
be
ashamed
they
read
it

out

it

i
was
a

once
i
was

it

call
by

permit

the

as
if
it
were
all
cooked
in
one
huge

but
there
was
enough
of
it
and
it
was
otherwise
good
and
the
fault
may
have
been
with
my

probably
was
it

getting

and
take
their

it
must
be

perhaps
i
struck
the

off

since
reading
this
proof
i
have
been
over
and
verified
my
diagnosis
the
trouble
must
have
been
with
me
the
soup
and
the
mutton
and
the
pie
had
each
its
proper
savor
and
the
cook
is
all
right
so
is
the
lunch
there
is
no
lunch
in
the
city
that
i
know
of
which
is
better
illustration
evening
in
one
of
the
courts
in
the
mills
house
no
no
is
the
largest
with
rooms
for
guests
and
usually
there
are
there
no
in
rivington
street
has
rooms
together
they
are
capable
of
housing
about
twelve
per
cent
of
all
who
nightly
seek
the
cheap
lodging
houses
not
counting
the
raines
law
hotels
which
are
chiefly
used
for
purposes
of
assignation
the
bowery
houses
have
felt
the
competition
and
have
been
compelled
to
make
concessions
that
profit
the
lodger
the
greatest
gain
to
him
is
the
chance
of
getting
away
from
there
at
the
mills
houses
he
is
reasonably
safe
from
the
man
and
the
recruiting
thief
though
the
latter
often
gives
the
police
the
bleecker
street
house
as
his
permanent
address
on
the
principle
that
makes
the
impecunious
seeker
of
a
job
conduct
his
correspondence
from
the
fifth
avenue
hotel
or
the
savoy
he
is
rarely
found
there
and
if
found
is
not
kept
long
if
he
does
get
in
he
is
quiet
and
harmless
because
he
has
to
be
crooks
in
action
seek
crooked
houses
kept
by
crooked
men
and
they
find
them
along
the
bowery
more
readily
than
anywhere
there
are
the
shows
and
the
resorts
that
draw
the
young
lads
who
away
from
home
are
all
too
easily
drawn
to
their
undoing
the
getting
them
out
of
their
latitude
is
the
greatest
gain
and
this
service
the
mills
house
performs
to
a
salutary
extent
the
more
readily
since
its
fame
has
gone
abroad
and
the
mills
house
has
become
a
type
there
is
scarcely
a
mail
now
that
does
not
bring
me
word
from
some
city
in
the
west
or
east
that
a
mills
house
has
been
started
there
in
the
effort
to
grapple
with
the
problem
of
the
floating
population
the
fear
that
their
reputation
may
help
increase
that
problem
by
drawing
greater
crowds
from
the
country
is
rather
strained
it
seems
to
me
the
objection
would
lie
against
free
shelters
but
hardly
against
a
business
concern
that
simply
strives
to
give
the
poor
lodger
his
money
worth
as
to
him
the
everlasting
pessimist
predicted
when
the
mills
houses
were
opened
that
they
would
have
to
make
bathing
compulsory
the
lodger
has
given
him
the
lie
the
average
has
been
over
bathers
per
day
one
in
five
and
the
record
has
passed
no
doubt
soap
may
be
cheap
and
salvation
dear
but
on
the
other
hand
cleanliness
does
and
must
ever
begin
godliness
when
fighting
the
slum
and
no
one
who
ever
took
a
look
into
one
of
the
lodging
houses
will
doubt
that
we
are
better
off
by
so
much
the
mills
houses
have
paid
four
even
five
per
cent
on
their
owner
investment
of
a
million
and
a
half
it
follows
that
the
business
will
attract
capital
which
means
that
there
will
be
an
end
of
the
old
nuisance
beyond
this
they
have
borne
and
will
bear
increasingly
a
hand
in
settling
with
the
saloon
with
which
they
compete
on
its
strong
ground
that
of
social
fellowship
it
has
no
rival
in
the
bowery
house
or
in
the
back
bedroom
every
philanthropic
effort
to
fight
it
on
that
ground
has
drawn
renewed
courage
and
hope
from
mills
work
and
success
many
years
ago
a
rich
merchant
planned
to
do
for
his
working
women
the
thing
mills
has
done
for
lonely
men
out
on
long
island
he
built
a
town
for
his
clerks
that
was
to
be
their
very
own
but
it
came
out
differently
the
long
island
town
became
a
cathedral
city
and
the
home
of
wealth
and
fashion
his
woman
boarding
house
a
great
public
hotel
far
beyond
the
reach
of
those
he
sought
to
benefit
the
passing
years
saw
his
great
house
its
wealth
its
very
name
vanish
as
if
they
had
never
been
and
even
his
bones
denied
by
ghoulish
thieves
rest
in
the
grave
there
is
no
more
pathetic
page
in
the
history
of
our
city
than
that
which
records
the
eclipse
of
the
house

alexander
stewart

like
to
think
of
the

philanthropy
as
a

undone

while
i
am
writing
this

are
putting
the
roof
on

almost
anything

it

to
fill
so
great
a
need

to
be
commercially
profitable

will
be

we
shall
all

had
never
made
any
provision

which
i
have
spoken
were
not
to
be

the
term

the
homeless
of
our
great

were
herded
without
pretence
of

the
most
pernicious
parody
on

verily
believe
that

had
ever
devised

made

came
an
evil
day

shut

disappeared

drained

the

was
literally
left
out

cold

was
the
climax
of
a
campaign
a
generation
old
during
which
no
one
had
ever
been
found
to
say
a
word
in
defence
of
these
lodging

we
learned
something
from
that
of
nearly
lodgers
were
under
thirty
years
old

good
health

began
with
a
view
of
setting
such
to
work
as
really
wanted
it
and
sending
the
rest
to
the

vagrants

number
fell
off

on

on
the

by

it
had
been
cut
down
to
the
problem
of
the
honestly
homeless
who
were
without
means
to
pay
for
a
bed
even
in
a
lodging
house

who
had
a
claim
upon
the

dwindled

surprisingly
small
proportions

were
shown
to
have
been

than
sixty
days

not
a

old
mistake
that
there
is
always
a

amount
of
absolutely
homeless
destitution
in
a
city
and
that
it
is
to
be
measured
by
the
number
of
those
who
apply
for
free
lodging
had
been
reduced
to
a
demonstration
the
truth
is
that
the
opportunity
furnished
by
the
triple
alliance
of
stale
beer
free
lunch
and
free
lodging
at
the

was
the

what
a

of
the

brought
forth

established
with
decent
beds

and

and
a
system
of
investigation
of
the
lodger
claim
that
is
yet
to
be
developed
to
useful
proportions
the
link
that
is
missing
is
a
farm
school

the
training
of
young
vagrants
to
habits
of
industry
and
steady
work
as
the
alternative
of
the
workhouse
efforts
to
forge
this
link
have
failed
so
far
but
in
the
good
time
that
is
coming
when
we
shall
have
learned
the
lesson
that
the
unkindest
thing
that
can
be
done
to
a
young
tramp
is
to
let
him
go
on
tramping
and
when
magistrates
shall
blush
to
discharge
him
on
the
plea
that
it
is
no
crime
to
be
poor
in
this
country
they
will
succeed
and
the
tramp
also
we
shall
then
have
druv
into
decency
when
i
look
back
now
to
the
time
ten
or
fifteen
years
ago
when
night
after
night
with
every
police
station
filled
i
found
the
old
tenements
in
the
bend
jammed
with
a
reeking
mass
of
human
wrecks
that
huddled
in
hall
and
yard
and
slept
crouching
in
shivering
files
all
the
way
up
the
stairs
to
the
attic
it
does
seem
as
if
we
had
come
a
good
way
and
as
if
all
the
turmoil
and
the
bruises
and
the
fighting
had
been
worth
while
new
york
is
no
longer
at
least
when
tammany
is
out
a
tramp
town
and
that
is
so
much
gained
to
us
and
to
the
tramp
chapter
vii
pietro
and
the
jew
we
have
seen
that
the
problem
of
the
tenement
is
to
make
homes
for
the
people
out
of
it
if
we
can
in
it
if
we
must
now
about
the
tenant
how
much
of
a
problem
is
he
and
how
are
we
to
go
about
solving
it
the
government
slum
inquiry
of
which
i
have
spoken
before
gave
us
some
facts
about
him
in
new
york
it
found
per
cent
of
the
population
of
the
slum
to
be
whereas
for
the
whole
city
the
percentage
of
foreigners
was
only
while
the
proportion
of
illiteracy
in
all
was
only
as
to
in
the
slum
it
was
per
cent
that
with
nearly
twice
as
many
saloons
to
a
given
number
there
should
be
three
times
as
many
arrests
in
the
slum
as
in
the
city
at
large
need
not
be
attributed
to
nationality
except
indirectly
in
its
possible
responsibility
for
the
saloons
i
say
possible
advisably
anybody
i
should
think
whose
misfortune
it
is
to
live
in
the
slum
might
be
expected
to
find
in
the
saloon
a
refuge
i
shall
not
quarrel
with
the
other
view
of
it
i
am
merely
stating
a
personal
impression
the
fact
that
concerns
us
here
is
the
great
proportion
of
the
though
the
inquiry
covered
only
a
small
section
of
a
tenement
district
the
result
may
be
accepted
as
typical
we
shall
not
then
have
to
do
with
an
american
element
in
discussing
this
tenant
for
even
of
the
natives
in
the
census
by
far
the
largest
share
is
made
up
of
the
children
of
the
immigrant
indeed
in
new
york
only
per
cent
of
the
slum
population
canvassed
were
shown
to
be
of
native
parentage
the
parents
of
per
cent
had
come
over
the
sea
to
better
themselves
it
may
be
assumed
let
us
see
what
they
brought
us
and
what
we
have
given
them
in
return
the
italians
were
in
the
majority

this
went

worst
of
the
italian
immigration
which
in
the
eleven
years
from
to
gave
us
nearly
a
million
of
victor
emmanuel
subjects
the
exact
number
of
italian
immigrants
as
registered
by
the
emigration
bureau
from
july
to
june
a
month
short
of
eleven
years
was
and
they
come
in
greater
numbers
every
year
in
came
over
of
whom
gave
new
york
as
their
destination
in
the
italian
immigrants
numbered
and
as
i
write
shiploads
with
thousands
upon
thousands
are
afloat
bound
for
our
shores
yet
there
is
a
gleam
of
promise
in
the
showing
of
last
year
for
of
the
those
who
came
to
stay
in
new
york
numbered
only
enough
surely
but
they
were
after
all
only
of
the
whole
against
in
if
this
means
that
they
came
to
join
friends
elsewhere
in
the
country
that
other
centres
of
immigration
have
been
set
up
well
and
good
there
is
room
for
them
there
going
out
to
break
ground
they
give
us
more
than
they
get
the
peril
lies
in
their
being
cooped
up
in
the
city
illustration
bedroom
in
the
new
city
lodging
house
of
last
year
intake
came
from
southern
italy
where
they
wash
less
and
also
plot
less
against
the
peace
of
mankind
than
they
do
in
the
north
quite
a
lot
were
from
sicily
the
island
of
the
absentee
landlord
where
peasants
die
of
hunger
i
make
no
apology
for
quoting
here
the
statement
of
an
italian
officer
on
duty
in
the
island
to
a
staff
correspondent
of
the
of
rome
a
paper
not
to
be
suspected
of
disloyalty
to
united
italy
i
take
it
from
the
in
the
month
of
july
i
stopped
on
a
march
by
a
where
they
were
measuring
grain
when
the
shares
had
been
divided
the
one
who
had
cultivated
the
land
received
a
single
less
than
a
half
bushel
the
peasant
leaning
on
his
spade
looked
at
his
share
as
if
stunned
his
wife
and
their
five
children
were
standing
by
from
the
painful
toil
of
a
year
this
was
what
was
left
to
him
with
which
to
feed
his
family
the
tears
rolled
silently
down
his
cheeks
these
things
occasionally
help
one
to
understand
over
against
this
picture
there
arises
in
my
memory
one
from
the
barge
office
where
i
had
gone
to
see
an
italian
steamer
come
in
a
family
sat
apart
ordered
to
wait
by
the
inspecting
officer
in
the
group
was
an
old
man
worn
and
wrinkled
who
viewed
the
turmoil
with
the
calmness
of
one
having
no
share
in
it
the
younger
members
formed
a
sort
of
bulwark
around
him
your
father
is
too
old
to
come
in
said
the
official
illustration
are
we
not
young
enough
to
work
for
him
two
young
women
and
a
boy
of
sixteen
rose
to
their
feet
at
once
are
not
we
young
enough
to
work
for
him
they
said
the
boy
showed
his
strong
arms
it
is
charged
against
this
italian
immigrant
that
he
is
dirty
and
the
charge
is
true
he
lives
in
the
darkest
of
slums
and
pays
rent
that
ought
to
hire
a
decent
flat
to
wash
water
is
needed
and
we
have
a
law
which
orders
tenement
landlords
to
put
it
on
every
floor
so
that
their
tenants
may
have
the
chance
and
it
is
not
yet
half
a
score
years
since
one
of
the
biggest
landlords
in
the
city
the
wealthiest
church
corporation
in
the
land
attacked
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
rather
than
pay
two
or
three
hundred
dollars
for
putting
water
into
two
old
buildings
as
the
board
of
health
had
ordered
and
so
came
near
upsetting
the
whole
structure
of
law
upon
which
our
safety
depends
talk
about
the
church
and
the
people
that
one
thing
did
more
to
drive
them
apart
than
all
the
ranting
of
atheists
that
ever
were
yesterday
a
magazine
came
in
the
mail
in
which
i
read
on
a
certain
street
corner
in
chicago
stands
a
handsome
church
where
hundreds
of
worshippers
gather
every
sabbath
morning
for
prayer
and
praise
just
a
little
way
off
almost
within
the
shadow
of
its
spire
lived
or
rather
herded
in
a
dark
damp
basement
a
family
of
eight
father
mother
and
six
children
for
all
the
influence
that
the
songs
or
the
sermons
or
the
prayers
had
upon
them
they
might
have
lived
there
and
died
like
rats
in
a
hole
they
did
not
believe
in
god
nor
heaven
nor
hell
other
than
that
in
which
they
lived
were
to
them
a
lot
of
canting
hypocrites
who
wrapped
their
comfortable
robes
about
them
and
cared
nothing
for
the
sufferings
of
others
hunger
and
misery
were
daily
realities
no
it
was
not
a
yellow
newspaper
it
was
a
religious
publication
and
it
told
how
a
warm
human
love
did
find
them
out
and
showed
them
what
the
church
had
failed
to
do
what
god
love
is
like
and
i
am
not
attacking
the
church
either
god
forbid
i
would
help
not
hinder
it
for
i
too
am
a
churchman
only
well
let
it
pass
it
will
not
happen
again
that
same
year
i
read
in
my
paper
the
reply
of
the
priest
at
the
in
stanton
street
to
a
crank
who
scoffed
at
the
kind
of
religion
they
had
there
kindergartens
nurseries
boys
and
clubs
and
mothers
meetings
yes
he
wrote
that
is
our
religion
we
believe
that
a
love
of
god
that
does
forthwith
run
to
manifest
itself
in
some
loving
deed
to
his
children
is
not
worth
having
that
is
how
i
came
to
be
a
churchman
in
bishop
potter
camp
i
joined
then
and
there
our
italian
is
ignorant
it
is
said
and
that
charge
is
also
true
i
doubt
if
one
of
the
family
in
the
barge
office
could
read
or
write
his
own
name
yet
would
you
fear
especial
danger
to
our
institutions
to
our
citizenship
from
those
four
he
lives
cheaply
crowds
and
underbids
even
the
jew
in
the
sweat
shop
i
can
myself
testify
to
the
truth
of
these
statements
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
was
the
umpire
in
a
quarrel
between
the
jewish
tailors
and
the
factory
inspector
whom
they
arraigned
before
the
governor
on
charges
of
inefficiency
the
burden
of
their
grievance
was
that
the
italians
were
underbidding
them
in
their
own
market
which
of
course
the
factory
inspector
could
not
prevent
yet
even
so
the
evidence
is
not
that
the
italian
always
gets
the
best
of
it
i
came
across
a
family
once
working
on
twelve
pants
ten
cents
said
the
tailor
when
there
was
work
ve
work
for
dem
sheenies
he
explained
ven
dey
has
work
ve
gets
some
ven
dey
has
ve
do
he
was
an
unusually
gifted
tailor
as
to
english
but
apparently
not
as
to
business
capacity
in
the
astor
tenements
in
elizabeth
street
where
we
found
families
living
in
rooms
intended
for
sixteen
i
saw
women
finishing
pants
at
thirty
cents
a
day
some
of
the
garments
were
of
good
grade
and
some
of
poor
some
of
them
were
soldiers
trousers
made
for
the
government
but
whether
they
received
five
seven
eight
or
ten
cents
a
pair
it
came
to
thirty
cents
a
day
except
in
a
single
instance
in
which
two
women
sewing
from
five
in
the
morning
till
eleven
at
night
were
able
being
practised
hands
to
finish
pants
at
three
and
a
half
cents
a
pair
and
so
made
together
over
a
dollar
and
a
half
they
were
content
even
happy
i
suppose
it
seemed
wealth
to
them
coming
from
a
land
where
a
parisian
investigator
of
repute
found
three
lire
not
quite
sixty
cents
a
girl
wages
i
remember
one
of
those
flats
poor
and
dingy
yet
with
signs
of
the
instinctive
groping
toward
orderly
arrangement
which
i
have
observed
so
many
times
and
take
to
be
evidence
that
in
better
surroundings
much
might
be
made
of
these
people
clothes
were
hung
to
dry
on
a
line
strung
the
whole
length
of
the
room
upon
couches
by
the
wall
some
men
were
snoring
they
were
the
boarders
the
man
was
out
shovelling
snow
with
the
midnight
shift
by
a
lamp
with
brown
paper
shade
over
at
the
window
sat
two
women
sewing
one
had
a
baby
on
her
lap
two
sweet
little
cherubs
nearly
naked
slept
on
a
pile
of
unfinished
pants
and
smiled
in
their
sleep
a
girl
of
six
or
seven
dozed
in
a
child
rocker
between
the
two
workers
with
her
head
hanging
down
on
one
side
the
mother
propped
it
up
with
her
elbow
as
she
sewed
they
were
all
there
and
happy
in
being
together
even
in
such
a
place
on
a
corner
shelf
burned
a
night
lamp
before
a
print
of
the
mother
of
god
flanked
by
two
green
bottles
which
seen
at
a
certain
angle
made
quite
a
festive
show
complaint
is
made
that
the
italian
promotes
child
labor
his
children
work
at
home
on
pants
and
flowers
at
an
hour
when
they
ought
to
have
been
long
in
bed
their
sore
eyes
betray
the
little
when
they
come
tardily
to
school
doubtless
there
are
such
cases
and
quite
too
many
of
them
yet
in
the
very
block
which
i
have
spoken
of
the
investigation
conducted
for
the
gilder
tenement
house
commission
by
the
department
of
sociology
of
columbia
university
under
professor
franklin
giddings
discovered
of
children
of
school
age
only
at
work
or
at
home
and
in
the
next
block
only
out
of
that
was
the
showing
of
the
foreign
population
all
the
way
through
of
russian
jewish
children
only
were
missing
from
school
and
of
little
bohemians
only
the
overcrowding
of
the
schools
and
their
long
waiting
lists
occasionally
furnished
the
explanation
why
they
were
not
there
professor
giddings
reported
after
considering
all
the
evidence
the
population
of
the
city
is
not
to
any
great
extent
forcing
children
of
legal
school
age
into
occupations
on
the
contrary
this
population
shows
a
strong
desire
to
have
its
children
acquire
the
common
rudiments
of
education
if
the
city
does
not
provide
liberally
and
wisely
for
the
satisfaction
of
this
desire
the
blame
for
the
civic
and
moral
dangers
that
will
threaten
our
community
because
of
ignorance
vice
and
poverty
must
rest
on
the
whole
public
not
on
our
residents
and
superintendent
maxwell
of
the
department
of
education
adds
six
years
later
that
with
a
shortage
of
seats
and
worse
coming
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
the
conclusion
that
the
insufficiency
of
school
accommodation
in
new
york
city
is
a
most
serious
menace
to
our
universal
welfare
for
we
have
reached
the
stage
again
thanks
be
to
four
years
of
tammany
when
after
all
the
sacrifices
of
the
past
we
are
once
more
face
to
face
with
an
army
of
enforced
truants
and
all
they
stand
for
footnote
superintendent
maxwell
in
december
he
is
clannish
this
italian
he
gambles
and
uses
a
knife
though
rarely
on
anybody
not
of
his
own
people
he
takes
what
he
can
get
wherever
anything
is
free
as
who
would
not
coming
to
the
feast
like
a
starved
wolf
there
was
nothing
free
where
he
came
from
even
the
salt
was
taxed
past
a
poor
man
getting
any
of
it
lastly
he
buys
fraudulent
naturalization
papers
and
uses
them
i
shall
plead
guilty
for
him
to
every
one
of
these
counts
they
are
all
proven
gambling
is
his
besetting
sin
he
is
sober
industrious
frugal
enduring
beyond
belief
but
he
will
gamble
on
sunday
and
quarrel
over
his
cards
and
when
he
sticks
his
partner
in
the
heat
of
the
quarrel
the
partner
is
not
apt
to
tell
he
prefers
to
bide
his
time
yet
there
has
lately
been
evidence
once
or
twice
in
the
surrender
of
an
assassin
by
his
countrymen
that
the
old
vendetta
is
being
shelved
and
a
new
idea
of
law
and
justice
is
breaking
through
as
to
the
last
charge
our
italian
is
not
dull
with
his
intense
admiration
for
the
land
where
a
dollar
a
day
waits
upon
the
man
with
a
shovel
he
can
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
accept
the
whole
american
plan
with
ready
enthusiasm
it
is
a
good
plan
to
him
it
sums
itself
up
in
the
statement
a
dollar
a
day
for
the
shovel
two
dollars
for
the
shovel
with
a
citizen
behind
it
and
he
takes
the
papers
and
the
two
dollars
he
came
here
for
a
chance
to
live
of
politics
social
ethics
he
knows
nothing
government
in
his
old
home
existed
only
for
his
oppression
why
should
he
not
attach
himself
with
his
whole
loyal
soul
to
the
plan
of
government
in
his
new
home
that
offers
to
boost
him
into
the
place
of
his
wildest
ambition
a
job
on
the
streets
that
is
in
the
street
cleaning
department
and
asks
no
other
return
than
that
he
shall
vote
as
directed
vote
not
only
he
but
his
cousins
and
brothers
and
uncles
will
vote
as
they
are
told
to
get
pietro
the
job
he
covets
if
it
pleases
the
other
man
what
is
it
to
him
for
whom
he
votes
he
is
after
the
job
here
to
the
hand
of
the
politician
is
such
material
as
he
never
saw
before
for
pietro
loyalty
is
great
as
a
police
detective
one
of
his
own
people
once
put
it
to
me
he
got
a
kind
of
an
idea
or
an
old
rule
an
eye
for
an
eye
do
to
another
as
you
be
done
by
if
he
do
squeal
on
you
you
stick
by
him
no
matter
what
the
consequences
this
kind
of
an
idea
is
all
he
has
to
draw
upon
for
an
answer
to
the
question
if
the
thing
is
right
but
the
question
does
not
arise
why
should
it
was
he
not
told
by
the
agitators
whom
the
police
jailed
at
home
that
in
a
republic
all
men
are
made
happy
by
means
of
the
vote
and
is
there
not
proof
of
it
it
has
made
him
happy
has
it
not
and
the
man
who
bought
his
vote
seems
to
like
it
well
then
illustration
the
play
school
dressing
dolls
for
a
lesson
very
early
pietro
discovered
that
it
was
every
man
for
himself
in
the
chase
of
the
happiness
which
this
powerful
vote
had
in
keeping
he
was
robbed
by
the
padrone
that
is
the
boss
when
he
came
over
fleeced
on
his
steamship
fare
made
to
pay
for
getting
a
job
and
charged
three
prices
for
board
and
lodging
and
extras
while
working
in
the
railroad
gang
the
boss
had
a
monopoly
and
pietro
was
told
that
it
was
maintained
by
his
divvying
with
some
railroad
official
rumor
said
a
very
official
and
that
the
railroad
was
in
politics
in
the
city
that
is
to
say
dealt
in
votes
when
the
job
gave
out
the
boss
packed
him
into
the
tenement
he
had
bought
with
his
profits
on
the
contract
and
if
pietro
had
a
family
told
him
to
take
in
lodgers
and
crowd
his
flat
as
the
elizabeth
street
tenements
were
crowded
so
as
to
make
out
the
rent
and
to
never
mind
the
law
the
padrone
was
a
politician
and
had
a
pull
he
was
bigger
than
the
law
and
it
was
the
votes
he
traded
in
that
did
it
all
now
it
was
pietro
turn
with
his
vote
he
could
buy
what
to
him
seemed
wealth
two
dollars
a
day
in
the
muddle
of
ideas
that
was
the
one
which
stood
out
clearly
when
citizen
papers
were
offered
him
for
he
bought
them
quickly
and
got
his
job
on
the
street
it
was
the
custom
of
the
country
if
there
was
any
doubt
about
it
the
proof
was
furnished
when
pietro
was
arrested
through
the
envy
and
plotting
of
the
opposition
boss
distinguished
counsel
employed
by
the
machine
pleaded
his
case
in
court
pietro
felt
himself
to
be
quite
a
personage
and
he
was
told
that
he
was
safe
from
harm
though
a
good
deal
of
dust
might
be
kicked
up
because
when
it
came
down
to
that
both
the
bosses
were
doing
the
same
kind
of
business
i
quote
from
the
report
of
the
state
superintendent
of
elections
of
january
in
nearly
every
case
of
illegal
registration
the
defendant
was
represented
by
eminent
counsel
who
were
identified
with
the
democratic
organization
among
them
being
three
assistants
to
the
corporation
counsel
my
deputies
arrested
rosario
calecione
and
giuseppe
marrone
both
of
whom
appeared
to
vote
at
the
fifth
election
district
of
the
sixth
assembly
district
marrone
being
the
democratic
captain
of
the
district
and
it
was
charged
himself
engaged
in
the
business
of
securing
fraudulent
naturalization
papers
in
both
of
these
cases
farriello
had
procured
the
naturalization
papers
for
the
men
for
a
consideration
they
were
subsequently
indicted
marrone
and
calecione
were
bailed
by
the
democratic
leader
of
the
sixth
assembly
district
the
business
says
the
state
superintendent
is
carried
on
to
an
enormous
extent
it
appears
then
that
pietro
has
already
got
on
to
the
american
plan
as
the
slum
presented
it
to
him
and
has
in
good
earnest
become
a
problem
i
guessed
as
much
from
the
statement
of
a
tammany
politician
to
me
a
year
ago
that
every
italian
voter
in
his
district
got
his
old
two
on
election
day
he
ought
to
know
for
he
held
the
purse
suppose
now
we
speak
our
minds
as
frankly
for
once
and
put
the
blame
where
it
belongs
will
it
be
on
pietro
and
upon
this
showing
who
ought
to
be
excluded
when
it
comes
to
that
the
slum
census
taker
did
not
cross
the
bowery
had
he
done
so
he
would
have
come
upon
the
refugee
jew
the
other
economic
marplot
of
whom
complaint
is
made
with
reason
if
his
nemesis
has
overtaken
him
in
the
italian
certainly
he
challenged
that
fate
he
did
cut
wages
by
his
coming
he
was
starving
and
he
came
in
shoals
in
eighteen
years
more
than
half
a
million
jewish
immigrants
have
landed
in
new
york
they
had
to
have
work
and
food
and
they
got
both
as
they
could
in
the
strife
they
developed
qualities
that
were
anything
but
pleasing
they
herded
like
cattle
they
had
been
so
herded
by
christian
rulers
a
despised
and
persecuted
race
through
the
centuries
their
very
coming
was
to
escape
from
their
last
inhuman
captivity
in
a
christian
state
they
lied
they
were
greedy
they
were
charged
with
bad
faith
they
brought
nothing
neither
money
nor
artisan
skill
nothing
but
their
consuming
energy
to
our
land
and
their
one
gift
was
their
greatest
offence
one
might
have
pointed
out
that
they
had
been
trained
to
lie
for
their
safety
had
been
forbidden
to
work
at
trades
to
own
land
had
been
taught
for
a
thousand
years
with
the
scourge
and
the
stake
that
only
gold
could
buy
them
freedom
from
torture
but
what
was
the
use
the
charges
were
true
the
jew
was
he
still
is
a
problem
of
our
slum
footnote
according
to
the
register
of
the
united
hebrew
charities
between
october
and
june
the
number
was
and
it
is
again
on
the
increase
the
year
will
probably
show
an
increase
in
this
class
of
immigration
over
of
quite
and
yet
if
ever
there
was
material
for
citizenship
this
jew
is
such
material
alone
of
all
our
immigrants
he
comes
to
us
without
a
past
he
has
no
country
to
renounce
no
ties
to
forget
within
him
there
burns
a
passionate
longing
for
a
home
to
call
his
a
country
which
will
own
him
that
waits
only
for
the
spark
of
such
another
love
to
spring
into
flame
which
nothing
can
quench
waiting
for
it
all
his
energies
are
turned
into
his
business
he
is
not
always
choice
in
method
he
often
offends
he
crowds
to
the
front
in
everything
no
matter
whom
he
crowds
out
the
land
is
filled
with
his
clamor
if
the
east
side
would
shut
its
mouth
and
the
west
side
get
off
the
saloon
corner
we
could
get
somewhere
said
a
weary
philanthropist
to
me
the
other
day
and
made
me
laugh
for
i
knew
what
he
meant
but
the
jew
heeds
it
not
he
knows
what
he
wants
and
he
gets
it
he
succeeds
he
is
the
yeast
of
any
slum
if
given
time
if
it
will
not
let
him
go
it
must
rise
with
him
the
charity
managers
in
london
said
it
when
we
looked
through
their
slums
some
years
ago
the
jews
have
renovated
whitechapel
i
for
one
am
a
firm
believer
in
this
jew
and
in
his
boy
ignorant
they
are
but
with
a
thirst
for
knowledge
that
surmounts
any
barrier
the
boy
takes
all
the
prizes
in
the
school
his
comrades
sneer
that
he
will
not
fight
neither
will
he
when
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
it
yet
in
defence
of
his
rights
there
is
in
all
the
world
no
such
fighter
as
he
literally
he
will
die
fighting
by
inches
too
from
starvation
witness
his
strikes
i
believe
that
should
the
time
come
when
the
country
needs
fighting
men
the
son
of
the
despised
immigrant
jew
will
resurrect
on
american
soil
the
first
that
bade
him
welcome
the
old
maccabee
type
and
set
an
example
for
all
the
rest
of
us
to
follow
this
long
while
he
has
been
in
the
public
eye
as
the
vehicle
and
promoter
of
sweating
and
much
severe
condemnation
has
been
visited
upon
him
with
good
cause
he
had
to
do
something
and
he
took
to
the
trade
as
that
which
was
most
quickly
learned
the
increasing
crowds
the
tenement
and
his
grinding
poverty
made
the
soil
wherein
the
evil
grew
rank
but
the
real
sweater
does
not
live
in
ludlow
street
he
keeps
the
stylish
shop
on
broadway
and
he
does
not
always
trouble
himself
to
find
out
how
his
workers
fare
much
as
that
may
have
to
do
with
the
comfort
and
security
of
his
customers
we
do
not
have
to
have
a
license
said
the
tenants
in
one
wretched
flat
where
a
consumptive
was
sewing
on
coats
almost
with
his
last
gasp
we
work
for
a
place
on
broadway
and
so
they
did
sweating
is
simply
a
question
of
profit
to
the
manufacturer
by
letting
out
his
work
on
contract
he
can
save
the
expense
of
running
his
factory
and
delay
longer
making
his
choice
of
styles
if
the
contractor
in
turn
can
get
along
with
less
shop
room
by
having
as
much
of
the
work
as
can
profitably
be
so
farmed
out
done
in
the
tenements
by
cheap
home
labor
he
is
so
much
better
off
and
tenement
labor
is
always
cheap
because
of
the
crowds
that
clamor
for
it
and
must
have
bread
the
poor
jew
is
the
victim
of
the
mischief
quite
as
much
as
he
has
helped
it
on
back
of
the
manufacturer
and
the
contractor
there
is
still
another
sweater
the
public
only
by
its
sufferance
of
the
bargain
counter
and
of
goods
has
the
nuisance
existed
as
long
as
it
has
i
am
glad
i
have
lived
to
see
the
day
of
its
passing
for
unless
i
greatly
mistake
it
is
at
hand
now
that
the
old
silent
partner
is
going
out
of
the
firm
i
mean
the
public
we
tried
it
in
the
old
days
but
the
courts
said
the
bill
to
stop
tenement
was
unconstitutional
labor
was
property
and
property
is
inviolable
rightly
so
until
it
itself
becomes
a
threat
to
the
commonwealth
child
labor
is
such
a
threat
it
has
been
stopped
in
the
factories
but
no
one
can
stop
it
in
the
tenement
so
long
as
families
are
licensed
to
work
there
the
wrecking
of
the
home
that
is
inevitable
where
the
home
is
turned
into
a
shop
with
thirty
cents
as
a
woman
wage
is
that
the
overcrowding
that
goes
hand
in
hand
with
is
that
the
scourge
of
consumption
which
doctors
and
boards
of
health
wrestle
with
in
vain
while
dying
men
and
women
sew
on
coats
with
their
last
gasp
and
sew
the
death
warrant
of
the
buyer
into
the
lining
is
a
threat
the
gravity
of
which
we
have
hardly
yet
made
out
courts
and
constitutions
reflect
the
depth
of
public
sentiment
on
a
moral
or
political
issue
we
have
been
doing
a
deal
of
dredging
since
then
and
we
are
at
it
yet
while
i
am
writing
a
tuberculosis
committee
is
at
work
sifting
the
facts
of
life
as
they
bear
on
that
peril
a
child
labor
committee
is
preparing
to
attack
the
slum
in
its
centre
as
we
stopped
the
advance
guard
when
we
made
the
unprofitable
the
factory
inspector
is
gathering
statistics
of
earnings
and
hours
of
labor
in
sweat
shop
and
tenement
to
throw
light
on
the
robbery
that
goes
on
there
when
they
have
told
us
what
they
have
to
tell
it
may
be
that
we
shall
be
able
to
say
to
the
manufacturer
you
shall
not
send
out
goods
to
be
made
in
sweat
shop
or
tenement
you
shall
make
them
in
your
own
shop
or
not
at
all
he
will
not
be
hurt
for
all
will
have
to
do
alike
i
am
rather
inclined
to
think
that
he
will
be
glad
to
take
that
way
out
of
a
grisly
plight
illustration
label
of
consumers
league
for
he
has
seen
the
signs
of
a
flank
movement
that
goes
straight
for
his
an
organized
public
sentiment
that
is
getting
ready
to
say
to
him
we
will
buy
no
clothes
or
wear
them
or
any
other
thing
whatsoever
that
is
made
at
the
price
of
the
life
and
hope
of
other
men
or
women
wherever
i
went
last
winter
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
women
were
stirring
to
organize
branches
of
the
league
true
they
were
the
not
yet
the
majority
but
they
were
the
very
ones
who
once
neither
knew
nor
cared
now
they
do
both
that
is
more
than
half
the
fight
whatever
may
be
the
present
results
of
the
agitation
in
the
long
run
i
would
rather
take
my
chances
with
a
vigorous
consumers
league
and
not
a
law
in
the
state
to
safeguard
labor
or
the
community
interests
than
with
the
most
elaborate
code
man
has
yet
devised
and
the
bargain
counter
in
full
blast
unchallenged
from
monday
to
saturday
laws
may
be
evaded
and
too
often
are
tags
betraying
that
goods
are
tenement
made
may
be
removed
and
they
make
no
appeal
anyhow
to
a
community
deaf
to
the
arraignment
of
the
bargain
counter
but
an
instructed
public
sentiment
such
as
that
of
which
the
consumers
league
is
the
most
recent
expression
makes
laws
and
enforces
them
too
by
its
aid
we
have
forced
the
children
out
of
the
factories
the
sweat
shops
out
of
the
tenements

shut
the
door

the
stranger

following

the
declaration
of
principles
of

national
consumers
league
sec
that
the
interests
of
the
community
demand
that
all
workers
shall
receive
fair
living
wages
and
that
goods
shall
be
produced
under
sanitary
conditions

that
the
responsibility
for
some
of
the

evils
from

suffer
rests
with
the
consumers
who
seek
the
cheapest
markets
regardless
how
cheapness
is
brought
about
sec
that
it
is
therefore
the
duty
of
consumers
to
find
out
under
what
conditions
the
articles
they
purchase
are
produced
and
distributed
and
insist
that
these
conditions
shall
be
wholesome

from
this
year
on
the
united
garment
workers
of
america
resolved
in
national
convention
to
give
their
stamp
to
no
manufacturer
who
does
not
have
all
his
work
done
on
his
own
premises
if
they
faithfully
live
up
to
that
compact
with
the
public
they
will
win
two
winters
ago
i
took
their
label
which
was
supposed
to
guarantee
living
wages
and
clean
and
healthy
conditions
from
the
hip
pocket
of
a
pair
of
trousers
which
i
found
a
man
sick
with
scarlet
fever
using
as
a
pillow
in
one
of
the
foulest
sweater
tenements
i
had
ever
been
in
and
carried
it
to
the
headquarters
of
the
union
to
show
them
what
a
mockery
they
were
making
of
the
mightiest
engine
that
had
come
to
their
hand
i
am
glad
to
believe
those
days
are
over
for
good
and
when
we
all
believe
it
their
fight
will
be
won
when
the
union
label
deserves
public
confidence
as
a
guarantee
against
such
things
it
will
receive
it
when
i
know
that
insisting
on
a
union
plumber
for
my
pipes
means
that
the
job
will
be
done
right
then
i
will
always
send
for
a
union
plumber
and
have
no
other
that
is
the
whole
story
and
on
that
day
the
label
will
be
mightier
than
any
law
because
the
latter
will
be
merely
the
effort
to
express
by
statute
the
principle
it
embodies
stragglers
there
will
always
be
i
suppose
it
was
only
the
other
day
i
read
in
the
report
of
the
consumers
league
in
my
own
city
that
a
benevolent
institution
when
found
giving
out
clothing
to
be
made
in
tenement
houses
that
were
not
licensed
and
taken
to
task
for
it
asked
the
agents
of
the
league
to
show
some
way
in
which
the
law
could
be
evaded
but
it
is
just
as
well
for
that
benevolent
institution
that
name
and
address
were
wanting
or
it
might
find
its
funds
running
short
unaccountably
we
waking
up
this
very
licensing
of
tenement
workers
is
proof
of
it
though
it
gives
one
a
cold
chill
to
see
thirty
thousand
licenses
out
with
hardly
a
score
of
factory
inspectors
to
keep
tab
on
them
roosevelt
as
governor
set
the
pace
going
himself
among
the
tenements
to
see
how
the
law
was
enforced
and
how
it
could
be
mended
now
we
have
a
registry
system
copied
from
massachusetts
where
they
do
these
things
right
and
most
others
besides
an
index
is
so
arranged

when
the

an
hour
and
before
noon
have
every
infected
flat
quarantined
word
is
sent
to
the
manufacturer
to
stop
sending
any
more
supplies
there
and
the
garments
in
the
house
are
tagged
till
after
disinfection
and
by
the
same
means
all
the
cards
are
laid
on
the
table
if
a
merchant
in
california
or
in
florida
brags
that
he
buys
only
goods
the
customer
can
find
out
through
the
consumers
league
if
it
is
true
if
the
register
shows
that
the
manufacturer
has
filed
lists
of
the
tenements
where
his
goods
are
made
up
it
is
not
true
all
of
which
helps
but
massachusetts
is
massachusetts
and
new

is
new

a
population
of
more
than
two
millions
of
souls
makes
its
own
problems
and
there
is
no
other
like
it
after
all
the
chief
function
of
the
license
must
in
the
end
be
to
show
that
it
can
not
be
done
so
safely
even
with
the
active
co√∂peration
of
the
board
of
health
and
with
the
nearly
two
hundred
inspectors
that
are
being
turned
loose
this
summer
full
of
new
zeal
and
desire
to
make
a
record
we
shall
yet
be
whipping
the
devil
around
the
stump
until
the
public
sentiment
fostered
by
the
consumers
league
and
its
allies
heads
him
off
on
the
other
side
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
job
is
too
big
for
the
law
alone
it
needs
the
gospel
to
back
it
up
together

can

the

holds

corner
in

industrial
system
though
never
for
long
he
yearns
ever
for
the

sides
of
his

he
remembers
where
the
jew
tries
only
to
forget
from
dalmatia
comes
a
new
emigration
and
there
are
signs
that
the
whole
balkan
peninsula
has
caught
the
fever
and
is
waiting
only
for
cheap
transportation
to
be
established
on
the
danube
to
the
black
sea
when
there
is
no
telling
what
will
be
heading
our
way
i
sometimes
wonder
what
thoughts
come
to
the
eagle
that
perches
over
the
great
stone
gateway
on
ellis
island
as
he
watches
the
procession
that
files
through
it
into
the
united
states
day
after
day
and
never
ends
he
looks
out
of
his
grave
unblinking
eye
at
the
motley
crowd
but
gives
no
sign
does
he
ask
where
are
the
pilgrim
fathers
the
brave
huguenots
the
patient
puritans
the
sturdy
priests
and
the
others
that
came
for
conscience
sake
to
build
upon
this
continent
a
home
for
freedom
and
these
why
do
they
come
with
their
strange
tongues
for
gold
true
eagle
but
look
to
the
roster
of
those
who
fought
and
died
for
the
freedom
those
pioneers
planted
who
watered
the
tree
with
their
life
blood
and
see
how
many
you
find
inscribed
there
who
came
through
that
gate
go
to
the
public
school
and
hear
their
children
speak
the
tongue
that
is
sweet
to
your
ear
hear
their
young
voices
as
they
salute
the
flag
that
is
illustration
one
door
that
has
been
opened
john
park
in
hudson
street
once
a
graveyard
we
give
our
heads
and
our
hearts
to
our
country
one
country
one
language
one
flag
fear
not
eagle
while
that
gate
is
open
let
no
one
bar
the
one
you
guard
while
the
flag
flies
over
the
public
school
keep
it
aloft
over
ellis
island
and
have
no
misgivings
the
school
has
the
answer
to
your
riddle
about
once
a
week
i
am
asked
would
i
shut
out
any
and
whom
and
how
and
why
sometimes
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
tenement
and
the
sweat
shop
that
is
to
say
the
city
i
think
i
would
and
were
that
all
i
certainly
should
but
then
there
comes
up
the
recollection
of
a
picture
of
the
city
of
prague
that
hangs
in
a
bohemian
parlor
here
in
new
york
i
stood
looking
at
it
one
day
and
noticed
in
the
foreground
cannon
that
pointed
in
over
the
city
i
spoke
of
it
unthinking
and
said
to
my
host
that
they
should
be
trained
if
against
an
enemy
the
other
way
the
man
eye
flashed
fire
ha
he
cried
here
yes
when
i
think
of
that
i
do
not
want
to
shut
the
door
again
there
occurs
to
me
an
experience
the
police
had
a
few
years
ago
in
mulberry
street
they
were
looking
for
a
murderer
and
came
upon
a
nest
of
italian
thugs
who
lived
by
blackmailing
their
countrymen
they
were
curious
about
them
and
sent
their
names
to
naples
with
a
request
for
information
there
came
back
such
a
record
as
none
of
the
detectives
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
before
all
of
them
were
notorious
criminals
who
had
been
charged
with
every
conceivable
crime
from
burglary
to
kidnapping
and
maiming
and
some
not
to
be
conceived
of
by
the
american
mind
five
of
them
together
had
been
times
in
jail
and
one
no
less
than
times
yet
though
they
were
all
under
special
surveillance
they
had
come
here
without
let
or
hindrance
within
a
year
when
i
recall
that
i
want
to
shut
the
door
quick
i
sent
the
exhibit
to
washington
at
the
time
illustration
jane
elizabeth
robbins
the
woman
doctor
but
then
again
when
i
think
of
michelangelo
in
her
poor
mourning
for
one
child
run
over
and
killed
wiping
her
tears
away
and
going
bravely
to
work
to
keep
the
home
together
for
the
other
five
until
the
oldest
shall
be
old
enough
to
take
her
father
place
and
when
as
now
there
strays
into
my
hand
the
letter
from
my
good
friend
the
woman
doctor
in
the
slum
in
which
she
wrote
when
her
father
lay
dead
the
little
scamps
of
the
street
have
been
positively
pathetic
they
have
made
such
shy
boyish
attempts
at
friendliness
one
little
chap
offered
to
let
me
hold
his
top
while
it
was
spinning
in
token
of
affection
when
i
read
that
i
have
not
the
heart
to
shut
anybody
out
except
of
course
the
unfit
the
criminal
and
the
pauper
cast
off
by
their
own
and
the
man
brought
over
here
merely
to
put
money
into
the
pockets
of
the
steamship
agent
the
padrone
and
the
mine
owner
we
have
laws
to
bar
these
out
suppose
we
begin
by
being
honest
with
ourselves
and
the
immigrant
and
respecting
our
own
laws
the
door
that
is
to
be
shut
is
over
yonder
at
the
port
where
they
take
ship
there
is
where
the
scrutiny
is
to
be
made
to
be
effective
when
the
door
has
been
shut
and
locked
against
the
man
who
left
his
country
for
his
country
good
whether
by
its
assistance
or
not
and
when
trafficking
in
the
immigrant
for
private
profit
has
been
stopped
then
perhaps
we
shall
be
better
able
to
decide
what
degree
of
ignorance
in
him
constitutes
unfitness
for
citizenship
and
cause
for
shutting
him
out
perchance
then
also
we
shall
hear
less
of
the
cant
about
his
being
a
peril
to
the
republic
doubtless
ignorance
is
a
peril
but
the
selfishness
that
trades
upon
ignorance
is
a
much
greater
he
came
to
us
without
a
country
ready
to
adopt
such
a
standard
of
patriotism
as
he
found
at
its
face
value
and
we
gave
him
the
rear
tenement
and
slum
politics
if
he
accepted
the
standard
whose
fault
was
it
his
being
in
such
a
hurry
to
vote
that
he
could
not
wait
till
the
law
made
him
a
citizen
was
no
worse
to
my
mind
than
the
treachery
of
the
upper
class
native
who
refuses
to
go
to
the
polls
for
fear
he
may
rub
up
against
him
there
this
last
let
us
settle
with
first
and
see
what
remains
of
our
problem
we
can
approach
it
honestly
then
at
all
events
i
came
into
town
on
the
pennsylvania
railroad
the
other
day
just
when
the
emigrant
lighter
had
tied
up
at
the
wharf
to
discharge
its
cargo
for
a
full
hour
i
stood
watching
the
stream
of
them
thousands
upon
thousands
carrying
knapsacks
and
trunks
odd
in
speech
and
ways
but
all
of
them
with
hopeful
faces
set
toward
the
great
country
where
they
were
to
win
their
own
way
so
they
answered
the
query
of
the
eagle
at
the
island
gate
scarce
an
hour
within
the
gate
they
were
no
longer
a
problem
the
country
needs
these
men
of
strong
arms
and
strong
courage
it
is
in
the
city
the
shoe
pinches
what
can
we
do
to
relieve
it
much
could
be
done
with
effective
inspection
on
the
other
side
to
discourage
the
blind
immigration
that
stops
short
in
the
city
slums
they
come
to
better
themselves
and
it
is
largely
a
question
of
making
it
clear
to
them
that
they
do
not
better
themselves
and
make
us
to
be
worse
off
by
staying
there
whereas
their
going
farther
would
benefit
both
but
i
repeat
that
that
lever
must
be
applied
over
there
to
move
this
load
once
they
are
here
we
might
have
a
land
and
labor
bureau
that
would
take
in
the
whole
country
and
serve
as
a
great
directory
and
distributing
agency
instead
of
leaving
it
to
private
initiative
to
take
up
the
crowds
something
much
more
comprehensive
than
anything
now
existing
there
would
still
be
a
surplus
but
at
least
it
would
be
less
by
so
many
as
we
sent
away
and
in
the
nature
of
things
the
congestion
would
be
lessened
as
more
went
out
immigrants
go
where
they
have
friends
and
if
those
friends
lived
in
michigan
we
should
not
be
troubled
with
them
long
in
new
york
if
the
immigration
came
all
from
one
country
we
should
because
of
that
have
no
problem
at
all
or
not
much
of
one
at
all
events
except
perhaps
in
the
jews
who
have
lived
in
ghettos
since
time
out
of
mind
the
others
would
speedily
be
found
making
only
a
way
station
of
new
york
it
is
the
constant
kaleidoscopic
change
i
spoke
of
that
brings
us
hordes
every
few
years
who
have
to
break
entirely
new
ground
it
seems
to
have
been
always
so
forty
years
after
the
settlement
of
manhattan
island
says
theodore
roosevelt
in
his
history
of
new
york
eighteen
different
languages
and
dialects
were
spoken
in
its
streets
though
the
future
metropolis
was
then
but
a
small
village
no
sooner
says
he
has
one
set
of
varying
elements
been
fused
together
than
another
stream
has
been
poured
into
the
crucible
what
was
true
of
new
york
two
hundred
years
ago
is
true
of
the
country
of
which
it
is
the
gateway
in
dealing
with
the
surplus
that
remains
we
shall
have
to
rely
first
and
foremost
on
the
public
school
of
that
i
shall
speak
hereafter
it
can
do
more
and
better
work
than
it
is
doing
for
the
old
as
for
the
young
when
it
becomes
the
real
neighborhood
centre
especially
in
the
slums
the
flag
flies
over
it
that
is
one
thing
and
not
such
a
little
thing
as
some
imagine
i
think
we
are
beginning
to
see
it
with
our
flag
day
and
our
putting
it
out
when
we
never
thought
of
it
five
or
six
years
ago
and
by
the
way
when
last
i
was
in
denmark
my
native
land
i
noticed
they
had
a
way
of
flying
the
flag
on
sunday
whether
in
honor
of
the
day
or
because
they
loved
it
or
because
they
felt
the
need
of
flying
it
in
the
face
of
their
big
and
greedy
german
neighbor
i
shall
not
say
but
it
was
all
right
why
can
we
not
do
the
same
it
would
not
hurt
the
flag
and
it
would
not
hurt
the
day
they
would
both
be
better
for
it
we
would
all
be
you
can
not
have
too
much
of
the
flag
in
the
right
way
and
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
about
that
just
go
into
one
of
the
children
aid
society
ragged
schools
where
the
children
are
practically
all
from
abroad
and
see
how
they
take
to
it
watch
an
italian
parade
in
which
it
is
always
borne
side
by
side
with
the
standard
of
united
italy
and
if
you
had
any
doubts
about
what
it
stands
for
you
will
change
your
mind
quickly
the
sight
of
it
is
worth
a
whole
course
in
the
school
for
education
in
citizenship
illustration
one
way
of
bringing
the
children
into
camp
in
vacation
school
and
then
it
looks
fine
in
the
landscape
always
it
always
makes
me
think
there
that
i
added
to
the
red
and
white
of
my
fathers
flag
only
the
blue
of
heaven
where
wrongs
are
righted
and
i
feel
better
for
it
why
should
it
not
have
the
same
effect
on
others
i
know
it
has
the
school
might
be
made
the
means
as
the
house
to
which
all
the
life
of
the
neighborhood
turned
of
enrolling
the
immigrants
in
the
perilous
years
when
they
are
not
yet
citizens
i
know
what
they
mean
i
have
gone
through
them
seen
most
of
the
mischief
they
hold
for
the
unattached
that
the
mischief
that
they
are
unattached
a
way
must
be
found
of
claiming
them
if
they
are
not
to
be
lost
to
the
cause
of
good
citizenship
where
they
might
so
easily
have
been
saved
i
spoke
of
it
in
the
making
of
an
american
they
want
to
belong
they
are
waiting
to
be
claimed
by
some
one
and
the
some
one
that
comes
is
tammany
with
its
slum
politics
the
mere
enrolling
of
them
with
leave
to
march
behind
a
band
of
music
suffices
with
the
young
they
belong
then
the
old
are
used
to
enrolment
where
they
came
from
they
were
enrolled
in
the
church
in
the
army
by
the
official
vaccinator
by
the
oh
yes
the
and
here
set
all
of
a
sudden
adrift
it
seems
like
a
piece
of
home
to
have
some
one
come
along
and
claim
them
write
them
down
and
tell
them
that
they
are
to
do
so
and
so
childish
is
it
not
at
all
it
is
just
human
nature
the
kind
we
are
working
with
the
mere
fact
that
the
schoolhouse
is
there
inviting
them
in
is
something
when
it
comes
to
seek
them
out
to
invite
them
to
their
own
hall
for
discussion
for
play
it
will
be
a
good
deal
particularly
if
the
women
go
along
and
the
enrolment
of
the
schoolhouse
could
be
counted
as
being
for
decency
it
makes
all
the
difference
what
the
start
is
like
excellency
wrote
an
italian
to
his
consul
in
new
york
i
arrived
from
italy
last
week
as
soon
as
i
landed
a
policeman
clubbed
me
i
am
going
to
write
to
victor
emmanuel
how
things
are
done
here
viva
l
italia
abbasso
america
i
should
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
man
plotting
anarchy
in
paterson
as
soon
as
he
got
his
bearings
and
neither
need
you
be
there
is
still
another
alternative
to
either
keeping
them
out
or
keeping
them
in
the
city
namely
to
ship
them
away
after
they
have
reached
the
slum
and
been
stranded
there
individually
or
in
squads
the
latter
way
was
tried
when
the
great
jewish
immigration
first
poured
in
in
the
early
eighties
five
colonies
of
refugee
jews
were
started
in
southern
new
jersey
but
they
failed
the
soil
was
sandy
and
poor
and
the
work
unfamiliar
thrown
upon
his
own
resources
in
a
strange
and
unfriendly
neighborhood
the
man
grew
discouraged
and
gave
up
in
despair
the
colonies
were
in
a
state
of
collapse
when
the
new
york
managers
of
the
baron
de
hirsch
fund
took
them
under
the
arms
and
gave
them
a
start
on
a
new
plan
they
themselves
had
located
a
partly
industrial
partly
farming
community
in
the
neighborhood
they
persuaded
several
large
clothing
contractors
to
move
their
plants
out
to
the
villages
where
they
would
be
assured
of
steady
hands
with
much
less
chance
of
disturbing
strikes
while
on
the
other
hand
their
workers
would
have
steadier
work
and
could
never
starve
in
dull
seasons
for
they
could
work
their
farms
and
gardens
and
indeed
a
perfect
frenzy
for
spading
and
hoeing
seized
them
when
the
crops
appeared
with
promise
of
unlimited
potatoes
for
the
digging
of
them
the
experiment
is
still
in
progress
it
is
an
experiment
because
as
yet
the
hirsch
fund
millions
back
the
colonies
up
and
there
is
no
passing
of
reasonable
judgment
upon
them
till
they
have
stood
alone
awhile
to
all
appearances
they
are
prospering
woodbine
the
hirsch
colony
especially
so
with
its
agricultural
school
that
has
set
out
upon
the
mission
of
turning
the
jew
back
to
the
soil
from
which
he
has
been
barred
so
long
its
pupils
came
out
of
the
sweat
shops
and
the
tenement
barracks
of
the
ghetto
and
a
likelier
lot
it
would
not
be
easy
to
find
one
can
but
wish
that
the
hopes
of
their
friends
may
be
realized
in
fullest
measure
they
have
put
their
hands
to
a
task
that
seems
like
turning
back
the
finger
of
time
and
snags
of
various
kinds
beset
their
way
i
remember
the
president
of
the
board
coming
into
my
office
one
day
with
despair
written
all
over
him
of
a
hundred
families
carefully
picked
to
go
into
the
country
where
homes
and
work
awaited
them
when
it
came
to
the
actual
departure
only
seven
wanted
to
go
it
was
the
old
story
of
objection
to
the
society
of
the
stump
they
wanted
the
crowds
the
bands
the
kosher
butcher
shops
the
fake
auction
stores
and
the
synagogues
they
were
used
to
they
have
learned
a
lesson
from
that
in
the
jersey
colonies
and
are
building
entertainment
halls
for
the
social
life
that
is
to
keep
them
together
only
a
year
or
so
ago
an
attempt
at
much
nearer
new
york
at
new
orange
just
over
the
hills
in
jersey
came
to
an
abrupt
end
it
left
out
the
farming
end
aiming
merely
at
the
removal
of
needle
workers
from
the
city
with
their
factory
a
building
was
put
up
for
a
large
new
york
tailoring
firm
and
it
moved
over
bodily
with
its
men
that
is
with
such
as
were
willing
to
go
work
was
plentiful
in
the
city
and
they
were
not
all
ready
to
surrender
the
tenement
for
the
sake
of
a
home
upon
the
land
though
a
very
attractive
little
cottage
awaited
them
on
singularly
easy
terms
however
that
was
almost
got
over
when
the
firm
suddenly
threw
up
the
contract
it
proved
to
be
costlier
for
them
to
manufacture
away
from
the
city
and
they
could
not
compete
if
there
is
yet
an
element
of
doubt
about
the
jew
as
a
colonist
there
is
none
about
his
ability
to
make
ends
meet
as
an
individual
farmer
given
a
fair
chance
more
than
a
thousand
such
are
now
scattered
through
the
new
england
states
and
the
dairy
counties
of
new
york
the
jewish
agricultural
aid
societies
of
new
york
and
chicago
gave
them
their
start
and
report
decided
progress
the
farmers
are
paying
their
debts
and
laying
away
money
as
a
dairy
farmer
or
poultry
raiser
the
jew
has
more
of
an
immediate
commercial
grip
on
the
situation
and
works
with
more
courage
than
if
he
has
to
wait
for
long
uncertain
crops
in
sullivan
and
ulster
counties
new
york
a
hundred
jewish
farmers
keep
summer
boarders
besides
and
are
on
the
highroad
to
success
very
recently
the
new
york
society
has
broken
new
paths
upon
an
individual
removal
plan
started
by
the
in
agents
are
sent
throughout
the
country
to
make
arrangements
with
jewish
communities
for
the
reception
of
workers
from
the
ghetto
and
so
successful
have
been
these
efforts
that
at
this
writing
some
five
thousand
have
been
moved
singly
and
scattered
over
the
country
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
that
is
in
not
yet
three
years
since
the
beginning
they
are
carefully
looked
after
and
the
reports
show
that
over
eighty
per
cent
of
all
do
well
in
their
new
surroundings
this
result
has
been
wrought
at
a
per
capita
expense
of
twelve
dollars
not
a
very
great
sum
for
such
a
work
in
its
bold
outline
the
movement
contemplates
nothing
less
than
the
draining
of
the
ghetto
by
the
indirect
process
of
which
i
spoke
the
importance
of
it
says
the
removal
committee
in
its
report
for
is
found
not
in
the
numbers
removed
but
in
the
inauguration
of
the
movement
which
should
and
must
be
greatly
extended
and
which
is
declared
to
be
of
significance
the
experience
of
past
years
has
proven
that
almost
every
family
removed
becomes
a
centre
around
which
immediately
and
with
ever
increasing
force
others
congregate
the
committee
in
charge
of
the
russian
immigration
in
has
evidence
that
cities
and
towns
to
which
but
a
very
small
number
of
newly
arrived
immigrants
were
sent
have
become
the
centres
of
large
communities
no
argument
is
needed
to
emphasize
this
statement
it
is
pleasing
to
be
told
that
the
office
of
the
removal
committee
has
been
besieged
by
eager
applicants
from
the
beginning
so
light
is
breaking
also
in
that
dark
corner
there
is
enough
of
it
everywhere
if
one
will
only
look
away
from
the
slum
to
those
it
holds
fast
the
people
are
all
right
was
the
unvarying
report
of
the
early
tenement
house
committees
if
we
only
give
them
half
a
chance
when
the
country
was
in
the
throes
of
the
silver
campaign
the
newspapers
told
the
story
of
an
old
laborer
who
went
to
the
and
demanded
to
see
the
boss
he
undid
the
strings
of
an
old
leathern
purse
with
fumbling
fingers
and
counted
out
more
than
two
hundred
dollars
in
gold
eagles
the
hoard
of
a
lifetime
of
toil
and
they
were
for
the
government
he
said
he
had
not
the
head
to
understand
all
the
talk
that
was
going
on
but
he
gathered
from
what
he
heard
that
the
government
was
in
trouble
and
that
somehow
it
was
about
not
having
gold
enough
so
he
had
brought
what
he
had
he
owed
it
all
to
the
country
and
now
that
she
needed
it
he
had
come
to
give
it
back
the
man
was
an
irishman
very
likely
he
was
enrolled
in
tammany
and
voted
its
ticket
i
remember
a
tenement
at
the
bottom
of
a
back
alley
over
on
the
east
side
where
i
once
went
visiting
with
the
pastor
of
a
mission
chapel
up
in
the
attic
there
was
a
family
of
father
and
daughter
in
two
rooms
that
had
been
made
out
of
one
by
dividing
off
the
deep
dormer
window
it
was
midwinter
and
they
had
no
fire
he
was
a
pedler
but
the
snow
had
stalled
his
and
robbed
them
of
their
only
other
source
of
income
a
lodger
who
hired
cot
room
in
the
attic
for
a
few
cents
a
night
the
daughter
was
not
able
to
work
but
she
said
cheerfully
that
they
were
getting
along
when
it
came
out
that
she
had
not
tasted
solid
food
for
many
days
was
starving
in
fact
indeed
she
died
within
a
year
of
the
slow
starvation
of
the
tenements
that
parades
in
the
mortality
returns
under
a
variety
of
scientific
name
which
all
mean
the
same
thing
she
met
her
gentle
chiding
with
the
excuse
oh
your
church
has
many
that
are
poorer
than
i
do
want
to
take
your
money
these
were
germans
ordinarily
held
to
be
but
i
found
that
in
their
dire
distress
they
had
taken
in
a
poor
old
man
who
was
past
working
and
kept
him
all
winter
sharing
with
him
what
they
had
he
was
none
of
theirs
they
hardly
even
knew
him
as
it
appeared
it
was
enough
that
he
was
poorer
than
they
and
lonely
and
hungry
and
cold
illustration
the
children
christmas
tree
it
was
over
here
that
the
children
of
elsing
gave
out
the
depth
of
their
poverty
dollars
in
pennies
to
be
hung
on
the
christmas
tree
as
their
offering
to
the
persecuted
armenians
one
of
their
teachers
told
me
of
a
bohemian
family
that
let
the
holiday
dinner
she
brought
them
stand
and
wait
while
they
sent
out
to
bid
to
the
feast
four
little
ragamuffins
of
the
neighborhood
who
else
would
have
gone
hungry
and
here
it
was
in
the
hard
winter
when
no
one
had
work
that
the
nurse
from
the
henry
street
settlement
found
her
cobbler
patient
entertaining
a
lodger
with
barely
bread
in
the
house
for
himself
and
his
boy
he
introduced
the
stranger
with
some
embarrassment
and
when
they
were
alone
excused
himself
for
doing
it
the
man
was
just
from
prison
a
man
with
a
history
but
said
the
nurse
doubtfully
is
it
a
good
thing
for
your
boy
to
have
that
man
in
the
house
there
was
a
passing
glimpse
of
uneasiness
in
the
cobbler
glance
but
it
went
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
nurse
this
he
said
ai
no
winter
to
let
a
fellow
from
sing
sing
be
on
the
street
i
might
keep
on
and
fill
many
pages
with
instances
of
such
kind
which
simply
go
to
prove
that
our
poor
human
nature
is
at
least
as
robust
on
avenue
a
as
up
on
fifth
avenue
if
it
has
half
a
chance
and
often
enough
with
no
chance
at
all
and
i
might
set
over
against
it
the
product
of
sordid
and
mean
environment
which
one
has
never
far
to
seek
good
and
evil
go
together
in
the
tenements
as
in
the
fine
houses
and
the
evil
sticks
out
sometimes
merely
because
it
lies
nearer
the
surface
the
point
is
that
the
good
does
outweigh
the
bad
and
that
the
virtues
that
turn
the
balance
are
after
all
those
that
make
for
manhood
and
good
citizenship
anywhere
while
the
faults
are
oftenest
the
accidents
of
ignorance
and
lack
of
training
which
it
is
the
business
of
society
to
correct
i
recall
my
discouragement
when
i
looked
over
the
examination
papers
of
a
batch
of
candidates
for
police
appointment
young
men
largely
the
product
of
our
public
schools
in
this
city
and
elsewhere
and
read
in
them
that
five
of
the
original
new
england
states
were
england
ireland
scotland
belfast
and
cork
that
the
fire
department
ruled
new
york
in
the
absence
of
the
mayor
i
have
sometimes
wished
it
did
and
that
he
would
stay
away
awhile
while
they
turned
the
hose
on
at
the
city
hall
to
make
a
clean
job
of
it
and
that
lincoln
was
murdered
by
ballington
booth
but
we
shall
agree
no
doubt
that
the
indictment
of
those
papers
was
not
of
the
men
who
wrote
them
but
of
the
school
that
stuffed
its
pupils
with
useless
trash
and
did
not
teach
them
to
think
neither
have
i
forgotten
that
it
was
one
of
these
very
men
who
having
failed
and
afterward
got
a
job
as
a
bridge
policeman
on
his
first
pay
day
went
straight
from
his
post
half
frozen
as
he
was
to
the
settlement
worker
who
had
befriended
him
and
his
sick
father
and
gave
him
five
dollars
for
some
one
who
was
poorer
than
they
poorer
than
they
what
worker
among
the
poor
has
not
heard
it
it
is
the
charity
of
the
tenement
that
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
there
were
thirteen
in
this
policeman
family
and
his
wages
were
the
biggest
item
of
income
in
the
house
jealousy
envy
and
meanness
wear
no
fine
clothes
and
masquerade
under
no
smooth
speeches
in
the
slums
often
enough
it
is
the
very
nakedness
of
the
virtues
that
makes
us
stumble
in
our
judgment
i
have
in
mind
the
difficult
case
that
confronted
some
philanthropic
friends
of
mine
in
a
rear
tenement
on
twelfth
street
in
the
person
of
an
aged
widow
quite
seventy
i
should
think
who
worked
uncomplainingly
for
a
sweater
all
day
and
far
into
the
night
pinching
and
saving
and
stinting
herself
with
black
bread
and
chickory
coffee
as
her
only
fare
in
order
that
she
might
carry
her
pitiful
earnings
to
her
big
lazy
lout
of
a
son
in
brooklyn
he
never
worked
my
friends
difficulty
was
a
very
real
one
for
absolutely
every
attempt
to
relieve
the
widow
was
wrecked
upon
her
mother
heart
it
all
went
over
the
river
yet
would
you
have
had
her
different
sometimes
it
is
only
the
unfamiliar
setting
that
shocks
when
an
east
side
midnight
burglar
discovered
and
pursued
killed
a
tenant
who
blocked
his
way
of
escape
not
long
ago
his
girl
gave
him
up
to
the
police
but
it
was
not
because
he
had
taken
human
life
he
was
good
to
me
she
explained
to
the
captain
whom
she
told
where
to
find
him
but
since
he
robbed
the
church
i
had
no
use
for
him
he
had
stolen
it
seems
the
communion
service
in
a
staten
island
church
the
thoughtless
laughed
but
in
her
ignorant
way
she
was
only
trying
to
apply
the
ethical
standards
she
knew
our
servant
pondering
if
the
fortune
she
was
told
is
real
good
at
fifteen
cents
when
it
should
have
cost
her
by
right
only
she
told
the
she
had
only
fifteen
and
lied
in
telling
is
doing
the
same
after
her
fashion
stunted
bemuddled
as
their
standards
were
i
think
i
should
prefer
to
take
my
chances
with
either
rather
than
with
the
woman
of
wealth
and
luxury
who
gave
a
christmas
party
to
her
as
on
the
whole
the
sounder
and
by
far
the
more
hopeful
all
of
which
is
merely
saying
that
the
country
is
all
right
and
the
people
are
to
be
trusted
with
the
old
faith
in
spite
of
the
slum
and
it
is
true
if
we
remember
to
put
it
that
way
in
spite
of
the
slum
there
is
nothing
in
the
slum
to
warrant
that
faith
save
human
nature
as
yet
uncorrupted
how
long
it
is
to
remain
so
is
altogether
a
question
of
the
sacrifices
we
are
willing
to
make
in
our
fight
with
the
slum
as
yet
we
are
told
by
the
officials
having
to
do
with
the
enforcement
of
the
health
ordinances
which
come
closer
to
the
life
of
the
individual
than
any
other
kind
that
the
poor
in
the
tenements
are
more
amenable
to
the
law
than
the
better
class
it
is
of
the
first
importance
then
that
we
should
have
laws
deserving
of
their
respect
and
that
these
laws
should
be
enforced
lest
they
conclude
that
the
whole
thing
is
a
sham
respect
for
law
is
a
very
powerful
bar
against
the
slum
but
what
for
instance
must
the
poor
jew
understand
who
is
permitted
to
buy
a
live
hen
at
the
market
but
neither
to
kill
nor
keep
it
in
his
tenement
and
who
on
his
feast
day
finds
a
whole
squad
of
policemen
detailed
to
follow
him
around
and
see
that
he
does
not
do
any
of
the
things
with
his
fowl
for
which
he
must
have
bought
it
or
the
day
laborer
who
drinks
his
beer
in
a
raines
law
hotel
where
brick
sandwiches
consisting
of
two
pieces
of
bread
with
a
brick
between
are
set
out
on
the
counter
in
derision
of
the
state
law
which
forbids
the
serving
of
drinks
without
meals
the
stanton
street
saloon
keeper
who
did
that
was
solemnly
acquitted
by
a
jury
or
the
boy
who
may
buy
fireworks
on
the
fourth
of
july
but
not
set
them
off
these
are
only
ridiculous
instances
of
an
abuse
that
pervades
our
community
life
to
an
extent
which
constitutes
one
of
its
gravest
perils
insincerity
of
that
kind
is
not
lost
on
our
by
adoption
who
is
only
anxious
to
fall
in
with
the
ways
of
the
country
and
especially
is
it
not
lost
on
his
boy
footnote
the
following
is
from
the
new
york
of
april
one
of
the
strangest
sandwich
complications
so
far
recorded
occurred
in
a
saloon
in
columbia
street
brooklyn
on
sunday
a
boy
rushed
into
the
amity
street
police
station
at
noon
declaring
that
two
men
in
the
saloon
were
killing
each
other
two
policemen
ran
to
the
place
and
found
the
bartender
and
a
customer
pummelling
each
other
on
the
floor
when
the
men
had
been
separated
the
police
learned
that
the
trouble
had
arisen
from
the
attempt
of
the
customer
to
eat
the
sandwich
which
had
been
served
with
his
drink
the
barkeeper
objected
and
finding
remonstrance
in
vain
resorted
to
physical
force
to
rescue
the
sandwich
from
the
clutches
of
the
hungry
stranger
the
police
restored
the
sandwich
to
the
bartender
and
made
no
arrests
we
shall
see
how
it
affects
him
he
is
the
one
for
whom
we
are
waging
the
battle
with
the
slum
he
is
the
that
sits
drinking
in
the
lesson
of
the
prosperity
of
the
big
boss
who
declared
with
pride
upon
the
witness
stand
that
he
rules
new
york
that
judges
pay
him
tribute
and
that
only
when
says
so
a
thing
goes
and
that
he
is
working
for
his
own
pocket
all
the
time
just
the
same
as
everybody
else
he
sees
corporations
pay
blackmail
and
rob
the
people
in
return
quite
according
to
the
schedule
of
hester
street
only
there
it
is
the
police
who
charge
the
pedler
twenty
cents
while
here
it
is
the
politicians
taking
toll
of
the
franchises
twenty
per
cent
wall
street
is
not
ordinarily
reckoned
in
the
slum
because
of
certain
physical
advantages
but
upon
the
evidence
of
the
day
i
think
we
shall
have
to
conclude
that
the
advantage
ends
there
the
boy
who
is
learning
such
lessons
how
is
it
with
him
the
president
of
the
society
for
the
prevention

to
children
says
that
children
crime
is
increasing
and
he
ought
to
know
the
managers
of
the
children
aid
society
after
nearly
fifty
years
of
wrestling
with
the
slum
for
the
boy
in
which
they
have
lately
seemed
to
get
the
upper
hand
said
recently
that
on
the
east
side
children
are
growing
up
in
certain
districts
entirely
neglected
and
that
the
number
of
such
children
increases
beyond
the
power
of
philanthropic
and
religious
bodies
to
cope
properly
with
their
needs
in
the
tompkins
square
lodging
house
the
evening
classes
were
thinning
out
and
the
keeper
wailed
those
with
whom
we
have
dealt
of
late
have
not
been
inclined
to
accept
this
privilege
how
to
make
night
school
attractive
to
shiftless
indifferent
street
boys
is
a
difficult
problem
to
solve
perhaps
it
was
only
that
he
had
lost
the
key
across
the
square
the
boys
club
of
mark
place
that
began
with
a
handful
counts
seven
thousand
members
and
is
building
a
house
of
its
own
the
school
census
man
announces
that
no
boy
in
that
old
stronghold
of
the
bread
or
blood
brigade
need
henceforth
loiter
in
the
street
because
of
there
not
being
room
in
the
public
school
and
the
brigade
has
disbanded
for
want
of
recruits
the
factory
is
being
more
and
more
firmly
shut
against
the
boy
and
the
bars
let
down
at
the
playground
from
tompkins
square
nevertheless
came
jacob
beresheim
whose
story
let
me
stop
here
to
tell
you
chapter
ix
the
genesis
of
the
gang
jacob
beresheim
was
fifteen
when
he
was
charged
with
murder
it
is
now
more
than
six
years
ago
but
the
touch
of
his
hand
is
cold
upon
mine
with
mortal
fear
as
i
write
every
few
minutes
during
our
long
talk
on
the
night
of
his
arrest
and
confession
he
would
spring
to
his
feet
and
clutching
my
arm
as
a
drowning
man
catches
at
a
rope
demand
with
shaking
voice
will
they
give
me
the
chair
the
assurance
that
boys
were
not
executed
quieted
him
only
for
the
moment
then
the
dread
and
the
horror
were
upon
him
again
of
his
crime
the
less
said
the
better
it
was
the
climax
of
a
career
of
depravity
that
differed
from
other
such
chiefly
in
the
opportunities
afforded
by
an
environment
which
led
up
to
and
helped
shape
it
my
business
is
with
that
environment
the
man
is
dead
the
boy
in
jail
but
unless
i
am
to
be
my
brother
jail
keeper
merely
the
iron
bars
do
not
square
the
account
of
jacob
with
society
society
exists
for
the
purpose
of
securing
justice
to
its
members
appearances
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
when
it
fails
in
this
the
item
is
carried
on
the
ledger
with
interest
and
compound
interest
toward
a
day
of
reckoning
that
comes
surely
with
the
paymaster
we
have
heard
the
chink
of
his
coin
on
the
counter
these
days
in
the
unblushing
revelations
before
legislative
investigating
committees
of
degraded
citizenship
of
the
murder
of
the
civic
conscience
and
in
the
applause
that
hailed
them
from
the
unthinking
crowd
and
we
have
begun
to
understand
that
these
are
the
interest
on
jacob
account
older
much
older
than
himself
he
is
just
an
item
carried
on
the
ledger
but
with
that
knowledge
the
account
is
at
last
in
the
way
of
getting
squared
let
us
see
how
it
stands
we
shall
take
jacob
as
a
type
of
the
street
boy
on
the
east
side
where
he
belonged
what
does
not
apply
to
him
in
the
review
applies
to
his
class
but
there
was
very
little
of
it
indeed
that
he
missed
or
that
missed
him
he
was
born
in
a
tenement
in
that
section
where
the
gilder
tenement
house
commission
found
persons
living
out
of
sight
and
reach
of
a
green
spot
of
any
kind
and
where
sometimes
the
buildings
front
middle
and
rear
took
up
per
cent
of
all
the
space
in
the
block
such
a
home
as
he
had
was
there
and
of
the
things
that
belonged
to
it
he
was
the
heir
the
sunlight
was
not
among
them
it
never
entered
there
darkness
and
discouragement
did
and
dirt
later
on
when
he
took
to
the
dirt
as
his
natural
weapon
in
his
battles
with
society
it
was
said
of
him
that
it
was
the
only
friend
that
stuck
to
him
and
it
was
true
very
early
the
tenement
gave
him
up
to
the
street
the
thing
he
took
with
him
as
the
one
legacy
of
home
was
the
instinct
for
the
crowd
which
meant
that
the
tenement
had
wrought
its
worst
mischief
upon
him
it
had
smothered
that
in
him
around
which
character
is
built
the
more
readily
did
he
fall
in
with
the
street
and
its
ways
character
implies
depth
a
soil
and
growth
the
street
is
all
surface
nothing
grows
there
it
hides
only
a
sewer
illustration
jacob
beresheim
it
taught
him
gambling
as
its
first
lesson
and
stealing
as
the
next
the
two
are
never
far
apart
from
shooting
craps
behind
the
cop
back
to
filching
from
the
grocer
stock
or
plundering
a
defenceless
pedler
is
only
a
step
there
is
in
both
the
spice
of
that
appeals
to
the
shallow
ambition
of
the
street
as
heroic
at
the
very
time
when
the
adventurous
spirit
is
growing
in
the
boy
and
his
games
are
all
of
daring
of
chasing
and
being
chased
the
policeman
looms
up
to
take
a
hand
and
is
hailed
with
joyful
awe
occasionally
the
raids
have
a
comic
tinge
a
german
grocer
wandered
into
police
headquarters
with
an
appeal
for
protection
against
the
boys
vat
means
dot
it
he
asked
rubbing
his
bald
head
in
helpless
bewilderment
efery
dime
dey
says
it
somedings
vas
gone
to
the
lawlessness
of
the
street
the
home
opposes
no
obstacle
as
we
have
seen
within
the
memory
of
most
of
us
the
school
did
not
it
might
have
more
to
offer
even
now
but
we
have
gone
such
a
long
way
since
the
day
i
am
thinking
of
that
i
am
not
going
to
find
fault
i
used
to
think
that
some
of
them
needed
to
be
made
over
until
they
were
fit
to
turn
out
whole
sound
boys
instead
of
queer
manikins
stuffed
with
information
for
which
they
have
no
use
and
which
is
none
of
their
business
anyhow
it
seemed
to
me
sometimes
when
watching
the
process
of
cramming
the
school
course
with
the
sum
of
human
knowledge
and
conceit
as
if
it
all
meant
that
we
distrusted
nature
way
of
growing
a
man
from
a
boy
and
had
set
out
to
show
her
a
shorter
cut
a
common
result
was
the
kind
of
mental
befogment
that
had
abraham
lincoln
murdered
by
ballington
booth
and
a
superficiality
a
hopeless
slurring
of
tasks
that
hitched
perfectly
with
the
spirit
of
the
street
and
left
nothing
to
be
explained
in
the
verdict
of
the
reformatory
no
moral
sense
there
was
no
moral
sense
to
be
got
out
of
the
thing
for
there
was
little
sense
of
any
kind
in
it
the
boy
was
not
given
a
chance
to
be
honest
with
himself
by
thinking
a
thing
through
he
came
naturally
to
accept
as
his
mental
horizon
the
headlines
in
his
penny
paper
and
the
literature
of
the
order
which
comprise
the
ordinary
√¶sthetic
equipment
of
the
slum
the
mystery
of
his
further
development
into
the
tough
need
not
perplex
anybody
but
jacob
beresheim
had
not
even
the
benefit
of
such
schooling
as
there
was
to
be
had
he
did
not
go
to
school
and
nobody
cared
there
was
indeed
a
law
directing
that
every
child
should
go
and
a
corps
of
truant
officers
to
catch
him
if
he
did
not
but
the
law
had
been
a
dead
letter
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
there
was
no
census
to
tell
which
children
ought
to
be
in
school
and
no
place
but
a
jail
to
put
those
in
who
shirked
jacob
was
allowed
to
drift
from
the
time
he
was
twelve
till
he
was
fifteen
he
told
me
he
might
have
gone
to
school
three
weeks
no
more
church
and
missed
him
i
was
going
to
say
that
they
passed
by
on
the
other
side
remembering
the
migration
of
the
churches
as
the
wealthy
moved
out
of
and
the
poor
into
the
region
south
of
fourteenth
street
but
that
would
hardly
be
fair
they
moved
after
their
congregations
but
they
left
nothing
behind
in
the
twenty
years
that
followed
the
war
while
enough
to
people
a
large
city
moved
in
the
number
of
churches
there
was
reduced
from
to
fourteen
protestant
churches
moved
out
only
two
roman
catholic
churches
and
a
synagogue
moved
in
i
am
not
aware
that
there
has
been
any
large
increase
of
churches
in
the
district
since
but
we
have
seen
that
the
crowding
has
not
slackened
pace
jacob
had
no
trouble
in
escaping
the
as
he
had
escaped
the
public
school
his
tribe
will
have
none
until
the
responsibility
incurred
in
the
severance
of
church
and
state
sits
less
lightly
on
a
christian
community
and
the
church
from
a
mob
shall
have
become
an
army
with
von
moltke
plan
of
campaign
march
apart
fight
together
the
christian
church
is
not
alone
in
its
failure
the
jew
boy
is
breaking
away
from
safe
moorings
rather
faster
than
his
brother
of
the
new
dispensation
the
church
looks
on
but
it
has
no
cause
for
congratulation
he
is
getting
nothing
in
place
of
that
which
he
lost
and
the
result
is
bad
there
is
no
occasion
for
profound
theories
about
it
the
facts
are
plain
enough
the
new
freedom
has
something
to
do
with
it
but
neglect
to
look
after
the
young
has
quite
as
much
apart
from
its
religious
aspect
seen
from
the
angle
of
the
community
interest
wholly
the
matter
is
of
the
gravest
import
what
the
boy
play
has
to
do
with
building
character
in
him
froebel
has
told
us
through
it
he
showed
us
the
child
first
perceives
moral
relations
and
he
made
that
the
basis
of
the
kindergarten
and
all
education
that
prop
was
knocked
out
new
york
never
had
a
children
playground
till
within
the
last
three
years
truly
it
seemed
as
abram
hewitt
said
as
if
in
the
early
plan
of
our
city
the
children
had
not
been
thought
of
at
all
such
moral
relations
as
jacob
was
able
to
make
out
ran
parallel
with
the
gutter
always
and
counter
to
law
and
order
as
represented
by
the
policeman
and
the
landlord
the
landlord
had
his
windows
to
mind
and
the
policeman
his
lamps
and
the
city
ordinances
which
prohibit
even
below
fourteenth
street
where
the
crowds
are
the
ball
had
no
chance
at
all
we
have
seen
in
new
york
a
boy
shot
down
by
a
policeman
for
the
heinous
offence
of
playing
football
in
the
street
on
thanksgiving
day
but
a
boy
who
can
not
kick
a
ball
around
has
no
chance
of
growing
up
a
decent
and
orderly
citizen
he
must
have
his
childhood
so
that
he
may
be
fitted
to
give
to
the
community
his
manhood
the
average
boy
is
just
like
a
little
with
steam
always
up
the
play
is
his
with
the
landlord
in
the
yard
and
the
policeman
on
the
street
sitting
on
his
and
holding
it
down
he
is
bound
to
explode
when
he
does
when
he
throws
mud
and
stones
and
shows
us
the
side
of
him
which
the
gutter
developed
we
are
shocked
and
marvel
much
what
our
boys
are
coming
to
as
if
we
had
any
right
to
expect
better
treatment
of
them
i
doubt
if
jacob
in
the
whole
course
of
his
wizened
little
life
had
ever
a
hand
in
an
honest
game
that
was
not
haunted
by
the
spectre
of
the
avenging
policeman
that
he
was
not
doing
anything
was
no
defence
the
mere
claim
was
proof
that
he
was
up
to
mischief
of
some
sort
besides
the
policeman
was
usually
right
play
in
such
a
setting
becomes
a
direct
incentive
to
mischief
in
a
healthy
boy
jacob
was
a
healthy
enough
little
animal
such
fun
as
he
had
he
got
out
of
in
a
small
way
in
this
he
was
merely
following
the
ruling
fashion
laws
were
apparently
made
for
no
other
purpose
that
he
could
see
such
a
view
as
he
enjoyed
of
their
makers
and
executors
at
election
seasons
inspired
him
with
seasonable
enthusiasm
but
hardly
with
awe
a
slogan
now
like
that
raised
by
tammany
late
candidate
for
district
attorney
to
hell
with
reform
was
something
he
could
grasp
of
what
reform
meant
he
had
only
the
vaguest
notion
but
this
thing
had
the
right
ring
to
it
roosevelt
preaching
enforcement
of
law
was
from
the
first
a
lobster
to
him
not
to
be
taken
seriously
it
is
not
among
the
least
of
the
merits
of
the
man
that
by
his
sturdy
personality
as
well
as
by
his
unyielding
persistence
he
won
the
boy
over
to
the
passive
admission
that
there
might
be
something
in
it
it
had
not
been
his
experience
footnote
in
the
first
greater
new
york
election
there
was
the
law
which
sternly
commanded
him
to
go
to
school
and
which
he
laughed
at
every
day
then
there
was
the
law
to
prevent
child
labor
it
cost
cents
for
a
false
age
certificate
to
break
that
and
jacob
if
he
thought
of
it
at
all
probably
thought
of
perjury
as
rather
an
expensive
thing
a
quarter
was
a
good
deal
to
pay
for
the
right
to
lock
a
child
up
in
a
factory
when
he
ought
to
have
been
at
play
the
excise
law
was
everybody
game
the
sign
that
hung
in
every
saloon
saying
that
nothing
was
sold
there
to
minors
never
yet
barred
out
his
growler
when
he
had
the
price
there
was
another
such
sign
in
the
tobacco
shop
forbidding
the
sale
of
cigarettes
to
boys
of
his
age
jacob
thought
that
when
he
had
the
money
he
smoked
as
many
as
fifteen
packs
a
day
and
he
laughed
when
he
told
me
he
laughed
too
when
he
remembered
how
the
boys
of
the
east
side
took
to
carrying
balls
of
cord
in
their
pockets
on
the
wave
of
the
lexow
reform
on
purpose
to
measure
the
distance
from
the
school
door
to
the
nearest
saloon
they
had
been
told
that
it
should
be
two
hundred
feet
according
to
law
there
were
schools
that
had
as
many
as
a
dozen
within
the
tabooed
limits
it
was
in
the
papers
how
when
the
highest
courts
said
that
the
law
was
good
the
saloon
keepers
attacked
as
a
nuisance
and
detrimental
to
property
in
a
general
way
jacob
sided
with
the
saloon
keeper
not
because
he
had
any
opinion
about
it
but
because
it
seemed
natural
such
opinions
as
he
ordinarily
had
he
got
from
that
quarter
when
later
on
he
came
to
be
tried
his
counsel
said
to
me
he
is
an
amazing
liar
no
hardly
amazing
it
would
have
been
amazing
if
he
had
been
anything
else
lying
and
mockery
were
all
around
him
and
he
adjusted
himself
to
the
things
that
were
he
lied
in
illustration
heading
off
the
gang
vacation
playground
near
old
frog
hollow
jacob
story
ends
here
as
far
as
he
is
personally
concerned
the
story
of
the
gang
begins
so
trained
for
the
responsibility
of
citizenship
robbed
of
home
and
of
childhood
with
every
prop
knocked
from
under
him
all
the
elements
that
make
for
strength
and
character
trodden
out
in
the
making
of
the
boy
all
the
high
ambition
of
youth
caricatured
by
the
slum
and
become
base
passions
so
equipped
he
comes
to
the
business
of
life
as
a
kid
he
hunted
with
the
pack
in
the
street
as
a
young
man
he
trains
with
the
gang
because
it
furnishes
the
means
of
gratifying
his
inordinate
vanity
that
is
the
slum
counterfeit
of
upon
the
jacobs
of
other
days
there
was
a
last
hold
the
authority
changed
conditions
have
loosened
that
also
there
is
a
time
in
every
young
man
life
when
he
knows
more
than
his
father
it
is
like
the
measles
or
the
mumps
and
he
gets
over
it
with
a
little
judicious
firmness
in
the
hand
that
guides
it
is
the
misfortune
of
the
slum
boy
of
that
it
is
really
so
and
that
he
knows
it
his
father
is
an
italian
or
a
jew
and
can
not
even
speak
the
language
to
which
the
boy
is
born
he
has
to
depend
on
him
in
much
in
the
new
order
of
things
the
old
man
is
slow
he
is
dutch
he
may
be
an
irishman
with
some
advantages
he
is
still
a
foreigner
he
loses
his
grip
on
the
boy
ethical
standards
of
which
he
has
no
conception
clash
watch
the
meeting
of
two
currents
in
river
or
bay
and
see
the
line
of
drift
that
tells
of
the
struggle
so
in
the
city
life
strive
the
currents
of
the
old
and
the
new
and
in
the
churning
the
boy
goes
adrift
the
last
hold
upon
him
is
gone
that
is
why
the
gang
appears
in
the
second
generation
the
first
born
upon
the
soil
a
fighting
gang
if
the
irishman
is
there
with
his
ready
fist
a
thievish
gang
if
it
is
the
east
side
jew
and
disappears
in
the
third
the
second
boy
father
is
not
slow
he
has
had
experience
he
was
clubbed
into
decency
in
his
own
day
and
the
night
stick
wore
off
the
glamour
of
the
thing
his
grip
on
the
boy
is
good
and
it
holds
it
depends
now
upon
chance
what
is
to
become
of
the
lad
but
the
slum
has
stacked
the
cards
against
him
there
arises
in
the
lawless
crowd
a
leader
who
rules
with
his
stronger
fists
of
his
readier
wit
around
him
the
gang
crystallizes
and
what
he
is
it
becomes
he
may
be
a
thief
like
david
meyer
a
report
of
whose
doings
i
have
before
me
he
was
just
a
bully
and
being
the
biggest
in
his
gang
made
the
others
steal
for
him
and
surrender
the
swag
or
take
a
licking
but
that
was
unusual
ordinarily
the
risk
and
the
swag
are
distributed
on
more
democratic
principles
or
he
may
be
of
the
temper
of
mike
of
poverty
gap
who
was
hanged
for
murder
at
nineteen
while
he
sat
in
his
cell
at
police
headquarters
he
told
with
grim
humor
of
the
raids
of
his
gang
on
saturday
nights
when
they
stocked
up
at
the
club
they
used
to
hook
a
butcher
cart
or
other
light
wagon
wherever
found
and
drive
like
mad
up
and
down
the
avenue
stopping
at
saloon
or
grocery
to
throw
in
what
they
wanted
his
job
was
to
sit
at
the
tail
of
the
cart
with
a
and
pop
at
any
chance
pursuer
he
chuckled
at
the
recollection
of
how
men
fell
over
one
another
to
get
out
of
his
way
it
was
great
to
see
them
run
he
said
mike
was
a
tough
but
with
a
better
chance
he
might
have
been
a
hero
the
thought
came
to
him
too
when
it
was
all
over
and
the
end
in
sight
he
put
it
all
in
one
sober
retrospective
sigh
that
had
in
it
no
craven
shirking
of
the
responsibility
which
was
properly
his
i
never
had
no
bringing
up
there
was
a
meeting
some
time
after
his
death
to
boom
a
scheme
for
getting
the
boys
off
the
street
and
i
happened
to
speak
of
case
in
the
audience
was
a
gentleman
of
means
and
position
and
his
daughter
who
manifested
great
interest
and
joined
heartily
in
the
proposed
movement
a
week
later
i
was
thunderstruck
at
reading
of
the
arrest
of
my
sympathetic
friend
son
for
up
the
state
the
fellow
was
of
the
same
age
as
mike
it
appeared
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
attending
school
but
had
been
reading
dime
novels
instead
until
he
arrived
at
the
point
where
he
had
to
kill
some
one
before
the
end
of
the
month
to
that
end
he
organized
a
gang
of
admiring
but
less
resourceful
comrades
after
all
the
planes
of
fellowship
of
poverty
gap
and
madison
avenue
lie
nearer
than
we
often
suppose
i
set
the
incident
down
in
justice
to
the
memory
of
my
friend
mike
if
this
one
went
astray
with
so
much
to
pull
him
the
right
way
and
but
the
single
strand
broken
what
then
of
the
other
mike
was
the
day
of
irish
heroics
since
their
scene
was
shifted
from
the
east
side
there
has
come
over
there
an
epidemic
of
child
crime
of
meaner
sort
but
following
the
same
principle
of
gang
organization
it
is
difficult
to
ascertain
the
exact
extent
of
it
because
of
the
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
mistaken
effort
on
the
part
the
children
societies
to
suppress
the
record
of
it
for
the
sake
of
the
boy
enough
testimony
comes
from
the
police
and
the
courts
however
to
make
it
clear
that
thieving
is
largely
on
the
increase
among
the
east
side
boys
and
it
is
amazing
at
what
an
early
age
it
begins
when
in
the
fight
for
a
truant
school
i
had
occasion
to
gather
statistics
upon
this
subject
to
meet
the
sneer
of
the
educational
authorities
that
the
crimes
of
street
boys
compassed
at
worst
the
theft
of
a
top
or
a
marble
i
found
among
prisoners
of
whom
i
had
kept
the
run
for
ten
months
two
boys
of
four
and
eight
years
respectively
arrested
for
breaking
into
a
grocery
not
to
get
candy
or
prunes
but
to
rob
the
till
the
little
one
was
useful
to
crawl
through
a
small
hole
there
were
burglars
of
six
and
seven
years
and
five
in
a
bunch
the
whole
gang
apparently
at
the
age
of
eight
wild
boys
began
to
appear
in
court
at
that
age
at
eleven
i
had
seven
thieves
two
of
whom
had
a
record
on
the
police
blotter
and
an
habitual
liar
at
twelve
i
had
four
burglars
three
ordinary
thieves
two
arrested
for
drunkenness
three
for
assault
and
three
incendiaries
at
thirteen
five
burglars
one
with
a
record
as
many
thieves
one
drunk
five
charged
with
assault
and
one
with
forgery
at
fourteen
eleven
thieves
and
housebreakers
six
highway
robbers
the
gang
on
its
unlucky
day
perhaps
and
ten
arrested
for
fighting
not
counting
one
who
had
assaulted
a
policeman
in
a
state
of
drunken
frenzy
one
of
the
gangs
made
a
specialty
of
stealing
baby
carriages
when
they
were
left
unattended
in
front
of
stores
they
drapped
the
kids
in
the
hallway
and
sneaked
the
carriages
and
so
on
the
recital
was
not
a
pleasant
one
but
it
was
effective
we
got
our
truant
school
and
one
way
that
led
to
the
jail
was
blocked
illustration
craps
it
may
be
that
the
leader
is
neither
thief
nor
thug
but
ambitious
in
that
case
the
gang
is
headed
for
politics
by
the
shortest
route
likewise
sometimes
when
he
is
both
in
either
case
it
carries
the
situation
by
assault
when
the
gang
wants
a
thing
the
easiest
way
seems
to
it
always
to
take
it
there
was
an
explosion
in
a
fifth
street
tenement
one
winter
night
that
threw
twenty
families
into
a
wild
panic
and
injured
two
of
the
tenants
badly
there
was
much
mystery
about
it
until
it
came
out
that
the
housekeeper
had
had
a
run
in
with
the
gang
in
the
block
it
wanted
club
room
in
the
house
and
she
would
not
let
it
in
beaten
it
avenged
itself
in
characteristic
fashion
by
leaving
a
package
of
gunpowder
on
the
stairs
where
she
would
be
sure
to
find
it
when
she
went
the
rounds
with
her
candle
to
close
up
that
was
a
gang
of
the
kind
i
have
reference
to
headed
straight
for
albany
and
what
is
more
it
will
get
there
unless
things
change
greatly
the
gunpowder
was
just
a
bluff
to
frighten
the
housekeeper
an
instalment
of
the
kind
of
politics
it
meant
to
play
when
it
got
its
chance
there
was
nothing
against
this
gang
except
a
probable
row
with
the
saloon
keeper
since
it
applied
elsewhere
for
house
room
not
every
gang
has
a
police
record
of
theft
and
slugging
beyond
the
early
encounters
of
the
street
our
honorable
leader
is
not
always
the
captain
of
a
band
of
cutthroats
he
is
the
honorary
president
of
the
social
club
that
bears
his
name
and
he
counts
for
something
in
the
ward
but
the
ethical
standards
do
not
differ
do
others
or
they
will
do
you
felicitously
adapted
from
holy
writ
for
the
use
of
the
slum
and
the
classic
to
the
victor
the
spoils
made
over
locally
to
read
i
am
not
in
politics
for
my
health
still
interpret
the
creed
of
the
political
as
of
the
slugging
gang
they
draw
their
inspiration
from
the
same
source
of
what
gang
politics
mean
every
large
city
in
our
country
has
had
its
experience
new
york
is
no
exception
history
on
the
subject
is
being
made
yet
in
sight
of
us
all
illustration
children
playground
good
citizenship
at
the
bottom
of
this
barrel
our
business
with
the
gang
however
is
in
the
making
of
it
take
now
the
showing
of
the
reformatory
to
which
i
have
before
made
reference
and
see
what
light
it
throws
upon
the
matter
per
cent
of
prisoners
with
no
moral
sense
or
next
to
none
yet
more
than
that
proportion
possessed
of
good
natural
mental
capacity
which
is
to
say
that
they
had
the
means
of
absorbing
it
from
their
environment
if
there
had
been
any
to
absorb
bad
homes
sent
half
of
all
prisoners
there
bad
company
per
cent
the
reformatory
repeats
the
prison
chaplain
verdict
weakness
not
wickedness
in
its
own
way
malevolence
does
not
characterize
the
criminal
but
aversion
to
continuous
labor
if
the
street
had
been
written
across
it
in
capital
letters
it
could
not
have
been
made
plainer
less
than
per
cent
of
the
prisoners
came
from
good
homes
and
one
in
had
kept
good
company
evidently
he
was
not
of
the
mentally
capable
they
will
tell
you
at
the
prison
that
under
its
discipline
eighty
odd
per
cent
are
set
upon
their
feet
and
make
a
fresh
start
with
due
allowance
for
a
friendly
critic
there
is
still
room
for
the
labelled
normal
of
natural
mental
capacity
they
came
to
their
own
with
half
a
chance
even
the
chance
of
a
prison
the
children
aid
society
will
give
you
still
better
news
of
the
boys
rescued
from
the
slum
before
it
had
branded
them
for
its
own
scarce
five
per
cent
are
lost
though
they
leave
such
a
black
mark
that
they
make
trouble
for
all
the
good
boys
that
are
sent
out
from
new
york
better
than
these
was
the
kindergarten
record
in
san
francisco
new
york
has
no
monopoly
of
the
slum
of
nine
thousand
children
from
the
slummiest
quarters
of
that
city
who
had
gone
through
the
golden
gate
association
kindergartens
just
one
was
found
to
have
got
into
jail
the
merchants
who
looked
coldly
on
the
experiment
before
brought
their
gold
to
pay
for
keeping
it
up
they
were
men
of
business
and
the
demonstration
that
schools
were
better
than
jails
any
day
appealed
to
them
as
eminently
sane
and
practical
footnote
of
elmira
state
reformatory
the
statistics
deal
with
prisoners
received
there
in
years
the
social
stratum
whence
they
came
is
sufficiently
indicated
by
the
statement
that
per
cent
were
illiterates
and
percent
were
able
to
read
and
write
with
difficulty
per
cent
had
an
ordinary
common
school
education
per
cent
came
out
of
high
schools
or
colleges
and
well
it
might
the
gang
is
a
distemper
of
the
slum
that
writes
upon
the
generation
it
plagues
the
receipt
for
its
own
corrective
it
is
not
the
night
stick
though
in
the
acute
stage
that
is
not
to
be
dispensed
with
neither
is
it
the
jail
to
put
the
gang
behind
iron
bars
affords
passing
relief
but
it
is
like
treating
a
symptom
without
getting
at
the
root
of
the
disease
prophylactic
treatment
is
clearly
indicated
the
boy
who
flings
mud
and
stones
is
entering
his
protest
in
his
own
way
against
the
purblind
policy
that
gave
him
jails
for
schools
and
the
gutter
for
a
playground
that
gave
him
dummies
for
laws
and
the
tenement
for
a
home
he
is
demanding
his
rights
of
which
he
has
been
cheated
the
right
to
his
childhood
the
right
to
know
the
true
dignity
of
labor
that
makes
a
manhood
the
gang
rightly
understood
is
our
ally
not
our
enemy
like
any
ailment
of
the
body
it
is
a
friend
come
to
tell
us
of
something
that
has
gone
amiss
the
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
find
out
what
it
is
and
set
it
right
that
is
the
story
of
the
gang
that
we
have
read
and
grasped
its
lesson
at
last
many
things
bear
witness
here
is
the
league
for
political
education
providing
a
playground
for
the
children
up
on
the
west
side
near
the
model
tenements
which
i
described
just
so
with
a
decent
home
and
a
chance
for
the
boy
to
grow
into
a
healthy
man
his
political
education
can
proceed
without
much
further
hindrance
now
let
the
league
for
political
education
trade
off
the
policeman
club
for
a
boys
club
and
it
may
consider
its
course
fairly
organized
i
spoke
of
the
instinct
for
the
crowd
in
the
man
as
evidence
that
the
slum
had
got
its
grip
on
him
and
it
is
true
of
the
boy
the
experience
that
the
helpless
poor
will
not
leave
their
slum
when
a
chance
of
better
things
is
offered
is
wearily
familiar
to
most
of
us
one
has
to
have
resources
to
face
the
loneliness
of
the
woods
and
the
fields
we
have
seen
what
resources
the
slum
has
at
its
command
in
the
boy
it
laid
hold
of
the
instinct
for
organization
the
desire
to
fall
in
and
march
in
line
that
belongs
to
all
boys
and
is
not
here
as
abroad
cloyed
with
military
service
in
the
young
years
and
anyhow
is
stronger
in
the
american
boy
than
in
his
european
brother
and
perverted
it
to
its
own
use
that
is
the
simple
secret
of
the
success
of
the
club
the
brigade
in
winning
back
the
boy
it
is
fighting
the
street
with
its
own
weapon
the
gang
is
the
club
run
wild
how
readily
it
owns
the
kinship
was
never
better
shown
than
by
the
experience
of
the
college
settlement
girls
when
they
first
went
to
make
friends
in
the
east
side
tenements
i
have
told
it
before
but
it
will
bear
telling
again
for
it
holds
the
key
to
the
whole
business
they
gathered
in
the
drift
all
the
little
embryo
gangs
that
were
tuning
up
in
the
district
and
made
them
into
clubs
young
heroes
knights
of
the
round
table
and
such
like
all
except
one
the
oldest
that
had
begun
to
make
a
name
for
itself
with
the
police
that
one
held
aloof
observing
coldly
what
went
on
to
make
sure
it
was
straight
they
let
it
be
keeping
the
while
an
anxious
eye
upon
it
until
one
day
there
came
a
delegation
with
this
olive
branch
if
you
will
let
us
in
we
will
change
and
have
your
kind
of
a
gang
needless
to
say
it
was
let
in
and
within
a
year
when
through
a
false
rumor
that
the
concern
was
moving
away
there
was
a
run
on
the
settlement
penny
provident
bank
the
converted
gang
proved
itself
its
stanchest
friend
by
doing
actually
what
john
halifax
did
in
miss
mulock
story
it
brought
all
the
pennies
it
could
raise
in
the
neighborhood
by
hook
or
by
crook
and
deposited
them
as
fast
as
the
regular
patrons
the
gang
had
not
yet
risen
to
the
dignity
of
a
bank
account
drew
them
out
until
the
run
ceased
this
same
gang
which
the
year
before
was
training
for
trouble
with
the
police
the
cry
get
the
boys
off
the
street
that
has
been
raised
in
our
cities
as
the
real
gravity
of
the
situation
has
been
made
clear
has
led
to
the
adoption
of
curfew
ordinances
in
many
places
any
attempt
to
fit
such
a
scheme
to
metropolitan
life
would
result
only
in
adding
one
more
law
more
dangerous
than
all
the
rest
to
those
we
have
new
york
is
new
york
and
one
look
at
the
crowds
in
the
streets
and
the
tenements
will
convince
anybody
besides
the
curfew
rings
at
nine
the
dangerous
hours
when
the
gang
is
made
are
from
seven
to
nine
between
supper
and
bedtime
this
is
the
gap
the
club
fills
out
the
boys
take
to
the
street
because
the
home
has
nothing
to
keep
them
there
to
lock
them
up
in
the
house
would
only
make
them
hate
it
more
the
club
follows
the
line
of
least
resistance
it
has
only
to
keep
also
on
the
line
of
common
sense
it
must
be
a
real
club
not
a
reformatory
its
proper
function
is
to
head
off
the
jail
the
gang
must
not
run
it
but
rather
that
than
have
it
help
train
up
a
band
of
wretched
young
cads
the
signs
are
not
hard
to
make
out
when
a
boy
has
had
his
head
swelled
by
his
importance
as
a
member
of
the
junior
band
to
the
point
of
reproving
his
mother
for
throwing
a
banana
peel
in
the
street
the
thing
to
be
done
is
to
take
him
out
and
spank
him
if
it
reverting
to
the
savagery
of
the
street
better
a
savage
than
a
cad
the
boys
have
the
making
of
both
in
them
their
vanity
furnishes
abundant
material
for
the
cad
but
only
when
unduly
pampered
left
to
itself
the
gang
can
be
trusted
not
to
develop
that
kink
it
comes
down
in
the
end
to
the
personal
influence
that
is
always
most
potent
in
dealing
with
these
problems
we
had
a
gang
start
up
once
when
my
boys
were
of
that
age
out
in
the
village
on
long
island
where
we
lived
it
had
its
headquarters
in
our
barn
where
it
planned
divers
raids
that
aimed
at
killing
the
cat
and
other
like
outrages
the
central
fact
being
that
the
boys
had
an
air
rifle
with
which
it
was
necessary
to
murder
something
my
wife
discovered
the
conspiracy
and
with
woman
wit
defeated
it
by
joining
the
gang
she
gave
in
wood
to
the
election
bonfires
and
pulled
the
safety
valve
upon
all
the
other
plots
by
entering
into
the
true
spirit
of
them
which
was
adventure
rather
than
mischief
and
so
keeping
them
within
safe
lines
she
was
elected
an
honorary
member
and
became
the
counsellor
of
the
gang
in
all
its
little
scrapes
i
can
yet
see
her
dear
brow
wrinkled
in
the
study
of
some
knotty
gang
problem
which
we
discussed
when
the
boys
had
been
long
asleep
they
did
not
dream
of
it
and
the
village
never
knew
what
small
tragedies
it
escaped
nor
who
it
was
that
so
skilfully
averted
them
it
is
always
the
women
who
do
those
things
they
are
the
law
and
the
gospel
to
the
boy
both
in
one
it
is
the
mother
heart
i
suppose
and
there
is
nothing
better
in
all
the
world
i
am
reminded
of
the
conversion
of
the
kid
by
one
who
was
in
a
very
real
sense
the
mother
of
a
social
settlement
in
the
latitude
of
battle
row
the
kid
was
driftwood
he
had
been
cast
off
by
a
drunken
father
and
mother
and
was
living
on
what
he
could
scrape
out
of
ash
barrels
and
an
occasional
dime
for
which
he
sold
from
a
wheelbarrow
when
the
gang
found
and
adopted
him
my
friend
adopted
the
gang
in
her
turn
and
civilized
it
by
slow
stages
easter
sunday
came
when
she
was
to
redeem
her
promise
to
take
the
boys
to
witness
the
services
in
a
neighboring
church
where
the
liturgy
was
especially
impressive
it
found
the
larger
part
of
the
gang
at
her
door
a
minority
it
was
announced
were
out
stealing
potatoes
hence
were
excusable
in
a
state
of
high
indignation
the
kid
been
cussin
awful
explained
the
leader
the
kid
showed
in
the
turbulent
distance
and
raging
but
why
asked
my
friend
in
amazement
he
ca
go
to
church
it
appeared
that
the
gang
had
shut
him
out
with
a
sense
of
what
was
due
to
the
occasion
because
of
his
rags
restored
to
grace
and
choking
down
reminiscent
sobs
the
kid
sat
through
the
easter
service
surrounded
by
the
proper
members
of
the
gang
civilization
had
achieved
a
victory
and
no
doubt
my
friend
remembered
it
in
her
prayers
with
thanksgiving
the
manner
was
of
less
account
battle
row
has
its
own
ways
even
in
its
acceptance
of
means
of
grace
illustration
the
gang
fell
in
with
joyous
shouts
i
walked
home
from
the
office
in
the
early
gloaming
the
street
wore
its
normal
aspect
of
mingled
dulness
and
the
kind
of
expectancy
that
is
always
waiting
to
turn
any
excitement
from
a
fallen
horse
to
a
fire
to
instant
account
the
early
june
heat
had
driven
the
multitudes
from
the
tenements
into
the
street
for
a
breath
of
air
the
boys
of
the
block
were
holding
a
meeting
at
the
hydrant
in
some
way
they
had
turned
the
water
on
and
were
splashing
in
it
with
bare
feet
revelling
in
the
sense
that
they
were
doing
something
that
went
against
their
enemy
the
policeman
upon
the
quiet
of
the
evening
broke
a
bugle
note
and
the
tramp
of
many
feet
keeping
time
a
military
band
came
around
the
corner
stepping
briskly
to
the
tune
of
the
stars
and
stripes
forever
their
white
duck
trousers
glimmered
in
the
twilight
as
the
hundred
legs
moved
as
one
stoops
and
hydrant
were
deserted
with
a
rush
the
gang
fell
in
with
joyous
shouts
the
young
fellow
linked
arms
with
his
sweetheart
and
fell
in
too
the
tired
mother
hurried
with
the
baby
carriage
to
catch
up
the
butcher
came
hot
and
wiping
his
hands
on
his
apron
to
the
door
to
see
them
pass
yes
said
my
companion
guessing
my
thoughts
we
had
been
speaking
of
the
boys
but
look
at
the
other
side
there
is
the
military
spirit
do
you
not
fear
danger
from
it
in
this
country
no
my
anxious
friend
i
do
not
let
them
march
and
if
with
a
gun
better
still
often
enough
it
is
the
choice
of
the
gun
on
the
shoulder
or
by
and
by
the
stripes
on
the
back
in
the
lockstep
gang
chapter
x
jim
i
used
to
think
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
jim
if
he
had
never
been
born
what
the
good
bishop
said
of
some
children
that
they
were
not
so
much
born
into
the
world
as
they
were
damned
into
it
seemed
true
of
jim
if
ever
it
was
true
of
any
one
he
had
had
a
father
once
who
was
kind
to
him
but
it
was
long
since
the
one
he
called
by
that
name
last
had
been
sent
to
sing
sing
to
the
lad
great
relief
for
a
midnight
burglary
shortly
after
he
married
jim
mother
his
back
hurt
yet
when
he
thought
of
the
evil
days
when
he
was
around
if
any
one
had
thought
it
worth
while
to
teach
jim
to
pray
he
would
have
prayed
with
all
his
might
that
his
father
might
never
come
out
but
no
one
did
so
that
he
was
spared
that
sin
i
suppose
that
was
what
it
would
have
been
called
i
am
free
to
confess
that
i
would
have
joined
jim
in
sinning
with
a
right
good
will
even
to
the
extent
of
speeding
the
benevolent
intentions
of
providence
in
that
direction
anyhow
until
jim
should
be
able
to
take
care
of
himself
i
mean
with
his
fists
he
was
in
a
way
of
learning
that
without
long
delay
for
ever
since
he
was
a
little
shaver
he
had
had
to
fight
his
own
way
and
sometimes
his
mother
he
was
thirteen
when
i
met
him
and
most
of
his
time
had
been
put
in
around
the
rag
gang
quarters
along
first
avenue
and
the
river
front
where
that
kind
of
learning
was
abundant
and
came
cheap
his
mother
drank
i
do
not
know
what
made
her
do
it
whether
it
was
the
loss
of
the
first
husband
or
getting
the
second
or
both
it
did
not
seem
important
when
she
stood
there
weak
and
wretched
and
humble
with
jim
and
as
for
my
preaching
to
her
sitting
in
my
well
fed
and
respectable
that
would
come
near
to
being
impertinence
so
it
always
struck
me
perhaps
i
was
wrong
anyway
it
would
have
done
her
no
good
too
much
harm
had
been
done
her
already
she
would
disappear
for
days
sometimes
for
weeks
at
a
time
on
her
frequent
sprees
jim
never
made
any
inquiries
on
those
occasions
he
kept
aloof
from
us
and
paddled
his
own
canoe
lest
we
should
ask
questions
it
was
when
she
had
come
home
sobered
that
we
saw
them
always
together
now
it
was
the
rent
and
then
again
a
few
groceries
with
such
lifts
as
she
got
sandwiched
in
with
much
good
advice
and
by
the
aid
of
an
odd
job
now
and
then
kelly
managed
to
keep
a
bit
of
a
roof
over
her
boy
and
herself
down
in
the
village
on
the
river
front
at
least
jim
had
a
place
to
sleep
until
one
day
our
visitor
reported
that
she
was
gone
for
good
she
and
the
boy
they
were
both
gone
nobody
in
the
neighborhood
knew
or
cared
where
and
the
room
was
vacant
except
that
they
had
not
been
dispossessed
we
could
learn
nothing
jim
was
not
found
and
in
the
press
of
many
things
the
kellys
were
forgotten
once
or
twice
his
patient
watchful
eyes
that
seemed
to
be
always
trying
to
understand
something
to
which
he
had
not
found
the
key
haunted
me
at
my
office
but
at
last
i
forgot
about
them
too
some
months
passed
it
was
winter
a
girl
who
had
been
one
of
our
cares
had
been
taken
to
the
city
hospital
to
die
and
our
visitor
went
there
to
see
and
comfort
her
she
was
hastening
down
the
long
aisle
between
the
two
rows
of
beds
when
she
felt
something
tugging
feebly
at
the
sleeve
of
her
coat
looking
round
she
saw
on
the
pillow
of
the
bed
she
had
just
passed
the
face
of
jim
mother
why
mrs
kelly
she
exclaimed
and
went
to
her
where
but
the
question
that
rose
to
her
lips
was
never
spoken
one
glance
was
enough
to
show
that
her
time
was
very
short
and
she
was
not
deceived
the
nurse
supplied
the
facts
briefly
in
a
whisper
she
had
been
picked
up
in
the
street
drunk
or
sick
the
diagnosis
was
not
clearly
made
out
at
the
time
but
her
record
was
against
her
she
lay
a
day
or
two
in
a
police
cell
and
by
the
time
it
was
clear
that
it
was
not
rum
this
time
the
mischief
was
done
probably
it
would
have
been
done
anyhow
the
woman
was
worn
out
what
now
lay
on
the
hospital
cot
was
a
mere
wreck
of
her
powerless
to
move
or
speak
she
could
only
plead
with
her
large
sad
eyes
as
she
tried
to
make
them
say
that
which
was
in
her
soul
two
big
tears
rolled
slowly
down
the
wan
cheeks
and
fell
on
the
coarse
sheet
the
visitor
understood
what
woman
would
not
jim
she
said
and
the
light
of
joy
and
understanding
came
into
the
yearning
eyes
she
nodded
ever
so
feebly
and
the
hand
that
rested
in
her
friend
twitched
and
trembled
in
the
effort
to
grasp
hers
i
will
find
him
it
is
all
right
now
you
be
quite
happy
i
will
bring
him
here
the
white
face
settled
back
on
the
pillow
and
the
weary
eyes
closed
with
a
little
sigh
of
contentment
very
strange
in
that
place
when
the
visitor
passed
her
cot
ten
minutes
later
she
was
asleep
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
it
proved
not
so
easy
a
matter
to
find
jim
we
came
upon
his
track
in
his
old
haunts
after
a
while
only
to
lose
it
again
and
again
it
was
clear
that
he
was
around
but
it
seemed
almost
as
if
he
were
purposely
dodging
us
and
in
fact
that
proved
to
have
been
the
case
when
at
last
after
a
hunt
of
weary
days
and
nights
through
the
neighborhood
he
was
brought
in
ragged
pale
and
pinched
by
hunger
we
saw
him
with
a
shock
of
remorse
for
having
let
him
drift
so
long
his
story
was
simple
enough
when
his
mother
failed
to
come
back
and
the
rent
coming
due
the
door
of
what
had
been
home
to
him
even
such
as
it
was
was
closed
upon
him
he
took
to
the
street
he
slept
in
hallways
and
with
the
gang
among
the
docks
never
going
far
from
the
village
lest
he
should
miss
news
of
his
mother
coming
back
the
cold
nights
came
and
he
shivered
often
in
his
burrows
but
he
never
relaxed
his
watch
all
the
time
his
mother
lay
dying
less
than
half
a
dozen
blocks
away
but
there
was
no
one
to
tell
him
had
any
one
done
so
it
is
not
likely
that
the
guard
would
have
let
him
through
the
gate
as
he
looked
seven
weeks
he
had
spent
in
the
streets
when
he
heard
that
he
was
wanted
the
other
boys
told
him
that
it
was
the
cruelty
man
sure
and
then
began
the
game
of
that
tried
our
patience
and
wore
on
his
mother
sinking
rapidly
now
but
that
eventually
turned
up
jim
illustration
mother
you
were
gone
so
long
we
took
him
up
to
the
hospital
and
into
the
ward
where
his
mother
lay
away
off
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
he
knew
her
the
last
in
the
row
and
ran
straight
to
her
before
we
could
stop
him
and
fell
on
her
neck
mother
we
heard
him
say
while
he
hugged
her
with
his
head
on
her
pillow
mother
why
do
you
speak
to
me
i
am
all
right
i
am
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
her
happy
tears
ran
down
the
thin
face
turned
to
his
he
took
her
in
his
arms
again
i
am
all
right
mother
honest
i
am
do
you
cry
i
could
keep
the
rooms
mother
they
took
everything
only
the
deed
to
grave
i
kept
that
he
dug
in
the
pocket
of
his
old
jacket
and
brought
out
a
piece
of
paper
carefully
wrapped
in
many
layers
of
rags
and
newspaper
that
hung
in
dirty
tatters
here
it
is
everything
else
is
gone
but
it
is
all
right
i
got
you
and
i
am
here
oh
mother
you
were
gone
so
long
longer
poor
jim
the
parting
that
was
even
then
adding
another
to
the
mysteries
that
had
vexed
my
soul
concerning
you
happiness
at
last
had
broken
the
weary
heart
but
if
it
added
one
it
dispelled
another
i
knew
then
that
i
erred
jim
when
i
thought
it
were
better
if
you
had
never
been
born
chapter
xi
letting
in
the
light
i
had
been
out
of
town
and
my
way
had
not
fallen
through
the
mulberry
bend
in
weeks
until
that
morning
when
i
came
suddenly
upon
the
park
that
had
been
made
there
in
my
absence
sod
had
been
laid
and
men
were
going
over
the
lawn
cutting
the
grass
after
the
rain
the
sun
shone
upon
flowers
and
the
tender
leaves
of
young
shrubs
and
the
smell
of
hay
was
in
the
air
crowds
of
little
italian
children
shouted
with
delight
over
the
garden
while
their
elders
sat
around
upon
the
benches
with
a
look
of
contentment
such
as
i
had
not
seen
before
in
that
place
i
stood
and
looked
at
it
all
and
a
lump
came
in
my
throat
as
i
thought
of
what
it
had
been
and
of
all
the
weary
years
of
battling
for
this
it
had
been
such
a
hard
fight
and
now
at
last
it
was
won
to
me
the
whole
battle
with
the
slum
had
summed
itself
up
in
the
struggle
with
this
dark
spot
the
whir
of
the
was
as
sweet
a
song
in
my
ear
as
that
which
the
skylark
sang
when
i
was
a
boy
in
danish
fields
and
which
gray
hairs
do
not
make
the
man
forget
illustration
keep
off
the
grass
in
my
delight
i
walked
upon
the
grass
it
seemed
as
if
i
should
never
be
satisfied
till
i
had
felt
the
sod
under
my
feet
sod
in
the
mulberry
bend
i
did
not
see
the
policeman
hastening
my
way
nor
the
youngsters
awaiting
with
shuddering
delight
the
catastrophe
that
was
coming
until
i
felt
his
cane
laid
smartly
across
my
back
and
heard
his
angry
command
hey
come
off
the
grass
d
think
it
is
made
to
walk
on
so
that
was
what
i
got
for
it
it
is
the
way
of
the
world
but
it
was
all
right
the
park
was
there
that
was
the
thing
and
i
had
my
revenge
i
had
just
had
a
hand
in
marking
five
blocks
of
tenements
for
destruction
to
let
in
more
light
and
in
driving
the
slum
from
two
other
strongholds
where
they
were
parks
are
being
made
in
which
the
sign
keep
off
the
grass
will
never
be
seen
the
children
may
walk
in
them
from
morning
till
night
and
i
too
if
i
want
to
with
no
policeman
to
drive
us
off
i
tried
to
tell
the
policeman
something
about
it
but
he
was
of
the
old
dispensation
all
the
answer
i
got
was
a
gruff
now
i
do
want
none
o
yer
guff
it
was
all
guff
to
the
politicians
i
suppose
from
the
day
the
trouble
began
about
the
mulberry
bend
but
toward
the
end
they
woke
up
nobly
when
the
park
was
finally
dedicated
to
the
people
use
they
took
charge
of
the
celebration
with
immense
unction
and
invited
themselves
to
sit
in
the
high
seats
and
glory
in
the
achievement
which
they
had
done
little
but
hamper
and
delay
from
the
first
they
had
not
reckoned
with
colonel
waring
however
when
they
had
had
their
say
the
colonel
arose
and
curtly
reminding
them
that
they
had
really
had
no
hand
in
the
business
proposed
three
cheers
for
the
citizen
effort
that
had
struck
the
slum
this
staggering
blow
there
was
rather
a
feeble
response
on
the
platform
but
rousing
cheers
from
the
crowd
with
whom
the
colonel
was
a
prime
favorite
and
no
wonder
two
years
later
he
laid
down
his
life
in
the
fight
which
he
so
valiantly
and
successfully
waged
it
is
the
simple
truth
that
he
was
killed
by
politics
the
services
which
he
had
rendered
the
city
would
have
entitled
him
in
any
reputable
business
to
be
retained
in
the
employment
that
was
his
life
and
his
pride
had
he
been
so
retained
he
would
not
have
gone
to
cuba
and
would
in
all
human
probability
be
now
alive
but
tammany
is
not
in
politics
for
its
health
and
had
no
use
for
him
though
no
more
grievous
charge
could
be
laid
at
his
door
even
in
the
heat
of
the
campaign
than
that
he
was
a
foreigner
being
from
rhode
island
spoils
politics
never
craved
a
heavier
sacrifice
of
any
community

colonel
george
waring
it
was
colonel
waring
broom
that
first
let
light
into
the
slum
that
which
had
come
to
be
considered
an
impossible
task
he
did
by
the
simple
formula
of
putting
a
man
instead
of
a
voter
behind
every
broom
the
words
are
his
own
the
man
from
a
political
dummy
who
loathed
his
job
and
himself
in
it
with
cause
became
a
citizen
and
the
streets
that
had
been
dirty
were
swept
the
ash
barrels
which
had
befouled
the
sidewalks
disappeared
almost
without
any
one
knowing
it
till
they
were
gone
the
trucks
that
obstructed

children
only

the
street
went
with
the
dirt
despite
the
opposition
of
the
truckman
who
had
traded
off
his
vote
to
tammany
in
the
past
for
stall
room
at
the
curbstone
they
did
not
go
without
a
struggle
when
appeal
to
the
alderman
proved
useless
the
truckman
resorted
to
strategy
he
took
a
wheel
off
or
kept
a
perishing
nag
that
could
not
walk
hitched
to
the
truck
over
night
to
make
it
appear
that
it
was
there
for
business
but
subterfuge
availed
as
little
as
resistance
in
the
mulberry
bend
he
made
his
last
stand
the
old
houses
had
been
torn
down
leaving
a
lot
full
of
dirt
mounds
and
cellar
holes
into
this
the
truckmen
of
the
sixth
ward
hauled
their
carts
and
defied
the
street
cleaners
they
were
no
longer
in
their
way
and
they
were
on
the
park
department
domain
where
no
colonel
waring
was
in
control
but
while
their
owners
were
triumphing
the
children
playing
among
the
trucks
set
one
of
them
rolling
down
into
a
cellar
and
three
or
four
of
the
little
ones
were
crushed
that
was
the
end
the
trucks
disappeared
even
tammany
has
not
ventured
to
put
them
back
so
great
was
the
relief
of
their
going
they
were
not
only
a
hindrance
to
the
sweeper
and
the
of
all
manner
of
mischief
at
night
but
i
have
repeatedly
seen
the
firemen
baffled
in
their
efforts
to
reach
a
burning
house
where
they
stood
four
and
six
deep
in
the
wide
slips
at
the
river
colonel
waring
did
more
for
the
cause
of
labor
than
all
the
walking
delegates
of
the
town
together
by
investing
a
despised
but
highly
important
task
with
a
dignity
which
won
the
hearty
plaudits
of
a
grateful
city
when
he
uniformed
his
men
and
announced
that
he
was
going
to
parade
with
them
so
that
we
might
all
see
what
they
were
like
the
town
laughed
and
poked
fun
at
the
white
wings
but
no
one
went
to
see
them
who
did
not
come
away
converted
to
an
enthusiastic
belief
in
the
man
and
his
work
public
sentiment
that
had
been
half
reluctantly
suspending
judgment
expecting
every
day
to
see
the
colonel
knuckle
down
to
politics
like
his
predecessors
turned
in
an
hour
and
after
that
there
was
little
trouble
the
tenement
house
children
organized
street
cleaning
bands
to
help
along
the
work
and
colonel
waring
enlisted
them
as
regular
auxiliaries
and
made
them
useful
they
had
no
better
friend
when
the
unhappy
plight
of
the
persecuted
men
all
immigrant
jews
who
were
blackmailed
robbed
and
driven
from
pillar
to
post
as
a
nuisance
after
they
had
bought
a
license
to
trade
in
the
street
appealed
vainly
for
a
remedy
colonel
waring
found
a
way
out
in
a
great
morning
market
in
hester
street
that
should
be
turned
over
to
the
children
for
a
playground
in
the
afternoon
but
though
he
proved
that
it
would
pay
interest
on
the
investment
in
market
fees
and
many
times
in
the
children
happiness
it
was
never
built
it
would
have
been
a
most
fitting
monument
to
the
man
memory
his
broom
saved
more
lives
in
the
crowded
tenements
than
a
squad
of
doctors
it
did
more
it
swept
the
cobwebs
out
of
our
civic
brain
and
conscience
and
set
up
a
standard
of
a
citizen
duty
which
however
we
may
for
the
moment
forget
will
be
ours
until
we
have
dragged
other
things
than
our
pavements
out
of
the
mud
illustration
a
east

before

even
the
colonel
broom
would
have
been
powerless
to
do
that
for
the

that
was
hopeless
and
had
to
go
there
was
no
question
of
children
or
playground
involved
the
worst
of
all
the
gangs
the
why√≥s
had
its
headquarters
in
the
darkest
of
its
dark
alleys
but
it
was
left
to
the
police
we
had
not
begun
to
understand
that
the
gangs
meant
something
to
us
beyond
murder
and
vengeance
in
those
days
no
one
suspected
that
they
had
any
such
roots
in
the
soil
that
they
could
be
killed
by
merely
destroying
the
slum
the
cholera
was
rapping
on
our
door
and
with
the
bend
there
we
felt
about
it
as
a
man
with
stolen
goods
in
his
house
must
feel
when
the
policeman
comes
up
the
street
back
in
the
seventies
we
began
discussing
what
ought
to
be
done
by
the
first
tenement
house
commission
had
summoned
up
courage
to
propose
that
a
street
be
cut
through
the
bad
block
in
the
following
year
a
bill
was
brought
in
to
destroy
it
bodily
and
then
began
the
long
fight
that
resulted
in
the
defeat
of
the
slum
a
dozen
years
later
illustration
the
same
street
when
colonel
waring
wielded
the
broom
it
was
a
bitter
fight
in
which
every
position
of
the
enemy
had
to
be
carried
by
assault
the
enemy
was
the
deadly
official
inertia
that
was
the
outcome
of
political
corruption
born
of
the
slum
plus
the
indifference
of
the
mass
of
our
citizens
who
probably
had
never
seen
the
bend
if
i
made
it
my
own
concern
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
it
was
only
because
i
knew
it
i
had
been
part
of
it
homeless
and
alone
i
had
sought
its
shelter
not
for
long
that
was
not
to
be
endured
but
long
enough
to
taste
of
its
poison
and
i
hated
it
i
knew
that
the
blow
must
be
struck
there
to
kill
looking
back
now
over
those
years
i
can
see
that
it
was
all
as
it
should
be
we
were
learning
the
alphabet
of
our
lesson
then
we
could
have
learned
it
in
no
other
way
so
thoroughly
before
we
had
been
at
it
more
than
two
or
three
years
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
the
bend
merely
the
small
parks
law
that
gave
us
a
million
dollars
a
year
to
force
light
and
air
into
the
slum
to
its
destruction
grew
out
of
it
the
whole
sentiment
which
in
its
day
groping
blindly
and
angrily
had
wiped
out
the
disgrace
of
the
five
points
just
around
the
corner
crystallized
and
took
shape
in
its
fight
it
waited
merely
for
the
issue
of
that
to
attack
the
slum
in
its
other
strongholds
and
no
sooner
was
the
bend
gone
than
the
rest
surrendered
time
was
up
but
it
was
not
so
easy
campaigning
at
the
start
in
plans
were
filed
for
the
demolition
of
the
block
it
took
four
years
to
get
a
report
of
what
it
would
cost
to
tear
it
down
about
once
in
two
months
during
all
that
time
the
authorities
had
to
be
prodded
into
a
spasm
of
activity
or
we
would
probably
have
been
yet
where
we
were
then
once
when
i
appealed
to
the
corporation
counsel
to
give
a
good
reason
for
the
delay
i
got
the
truth
out
of
him
without
evasion
well
i
tell
you
he
said
blandly
no
one
here
is
taking
any
interest
in
that
business
that
is
good
enough
reason
for
you
is
it
it
was
that
tammany
reason
became
the
slogan
of
an
assault
upon
official
incompetence
and
treachery
that
hurried
things
up
considerably
the
property
was
condemned
at
a
total
cost
to
the
city
of
a
million
and
a
half
in
round
numbers
including
the
assessment
of
half
a
million
for
park
benefit
which
the
property
owners
were
quick
enough
with
the
aid
of
the
politicians
to
get
saddled
on
the
city
at
large
in
the
city
took
possession
and
became
the
landlord
of
the
old
barracks
for
a
whole
year
it
complacently
collected
the
rents
and
did
nothing
when
it
was
shamed
out
of
that
rut
too
and
the
tenements
were
at
last
torn
down
the
square

as
the
wreckers
had
left
it
for
another
year
until
it
became
such
a
plague
spot
that
as
a
last
resort
with
a
citizen
privilege
i
arraigned
the
municipality
before
the
board
of
health
for
maintaining
a
nuisance
upon
its
premises
i
can
see
the
shocked
look
of
the
official
now
as
he
studied
the
complaint
but
my
dear
sir
he
coughed
diplomatically
is
it
rather
unusual
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
neither
did
i
i
replied
but
then
there
never
was
such
a
thing
before
that
night
while
they
were
debating
the
unusual
thing
happened
the
accident
to
the
children
of
which
i
spoke
emphasizing
the
charge
that
the
nuisance
was
dangerous
to
life
and
there
was
an
end
in
the
morning
the
bend
was
taken
in
hand
and
the
following
spring
the
mulberry
bend
park
was
opened

told
the
story

that

how
the
red
tape
of
the
comptroller
office
pointed
the
way
out
after
all
with
its
check
for
three
cents

had
gone
astray
in
the
purchase
of
a
school
site

sort

had
enough
but
the
gilder
tenement

been
sitting

committee

been
at
work

law
was
on

the
expenditure
of
three
million
dollars
for
two
open
spaces
in

parkless
district

of
bathers
in
one
brief
season
the
great
unwashed
were
not
so
from
choice
it
would
appear
the
river
baths
were
only
for
summer
and
their
time
is
past
as
the
sewers
that
empty
into
the
river
multiply
it
is
getting
less
and
less
a
place
fit
to
bathe
in
though
the
boys
find
no
fault
sixteen
public
on
shore
are
to
take
the
place
of
the
swimming
baths
they
are
all
to
be
in
the
crowded
tenement
districts
the
sites
for
the
first
three
are
being
chosen
now
and
a
wise
woman
offers
to
build
and
equip
one

complete
at
her
own
expense

her
gift

footnote
a
a
anderson
pull
up
now
a
minute
if
you
think
with
some
good
folks
that
the
world
is
not
advancing
but
just
marking
time
and
look
back
half
a
century
i
said
that
new
york
never
had
a
public
bath
till
now
i
meant
a
free
bath
as
long
ago
as
just
fifty
years
ago
the
association
for
improving
the
condition
of
the
poor
built
one
in
mott
street
near
grand
street
and
spent
in
doing
it
it
ran
eight
years
and
was
then
closed
for
want
of
patronage
forty
years
passed
and
it
was
again
the
association
for
improving
the
condition
of
the
poor
that
built
the
people
baths
in
the
same
neighborhood
that
time
they
succeeded
at
once
and
now
here
we
are
planning
a
great
system
of
municipal
baths
as
the
people
right
not
as
a
favor
to
any
one
and
the
old
lie
that
the
poor
prefer
to
steep
in
their
squalor
is
no
longer
believed
by
any
person
with
sense
this
month
contracts
will
be
given
out
for
the
fitting
of
nine
public
schools
with
where
we
had
one
before
and
notice
is
given
that
that
one
will
be
open
to
the
people
on
sunday
mornings
no
we
are
not
marking
time
we
are
forging
ahead
every
park
every
playground
every
is
a
nail
in
the
coffin
of
the
slum
and
every
big
beautiful
schoolhouse
built
for
the
people
use
not
merely
to
lock
the
children
up
in
during
certain
hours
for
which
the
teachers
collect
pay
is
a
pole
rammed
right
through
the
heart
of
it
so
that
even
its
ghost
shall
never
walk
again
for
ever
so
much
of
it
we
thank
that
association
of
men
of
splendid
courage
and
public
spirit
they
fight
to
win
because
they
believe
in
the
people
they
fight
the
people
and
so
they
are
bound
to
win
every
once
in
a
while
these
days
a
false
note
in
it
all
jars
upon
me
a
note
of
dread
lest
those
we
are
trying
to
help
get
tired
of
the
word
reform
and
balk
reform
such
as
we
have
occasionally
had
is
to
blame
for
some
of
that
certainly
you
do
not
want
to
reform
men
by
main
strength
drag
them
into
righteousness
by
the
hair
of
the
head
as
it
were
and
let
it
be
freely
admitted
that
the
man
on
fifth
avenue
needs
to
be
reformed
quite
as
much
as
his
neighbor
in
mulberry
street
whom
he
forgot
more
since
it
is
his
will
to
mend
things
that
has
to
be
righted
while
it
is
the
other
power
to
do
it
that
is
lacking
but
right
there
stop
let
us
have
no
pretending
that
there
is
nothing
to
mend
there
is
a
good
deal
and
it
is
not
going
to
be
mended
by
stuffing
the
one
you
would
help
with
conceit
and
ingratitude
ingratitude
does
not
naturally
inhabit
the
slums
but
it
is
a
crop
that
is
easily
grown
there
and
where
it
does
grow
there
is
an
end
of
efforts
to
mend
things
in
that
generation
you
do
not
want
to
come
to
your
work
for
your
fellows
when
you
go
from
the
front
to
the
tenement
but
neither
do
you
want
to
make
him
believe
that
you
feel
you
are
coming
up
to
him
for
you
know
you
do
not
feel
that
way
and
moreover
it
is
not
true
if
you
are
coming
at
all
you
want
to
come
right
to
help
him
reform
conditions
of
his
life
with
which
he
can
not
grapple
alone
and
it
is
as
good
for
him
as
it
is
for
you
to
know
that
you
are
doing
it
for
that
is
the
brotherhood
and
now
you
can
see
how
that
is
the
only
thing
that
really
helps
charity
may
corrupt
correction
may
harden
and
estrange
in
the
family
they
do
neither
there
you
can
give
and
take
without
offence
children
of
one
father
spin
all
the
fine
theories
you
like
build
up
systems
of
profound
philosophy
of
social
ethics
of
philanthropic
endeavor
back
to
that
you
get
if
you
get
anywhere
at
all
i
did
not
mean
to
preach
i
was
just
thinking
that
the
association
for
improving
the
condition
of
the
poor
in
its
fifty
years
of
battling
with
all
that
makes
the
slum
has
come
nearer
that
ideal
than
any
and
all
the
rest
of
us
and
the
president
of
it
these
ten
years
the
same
who
with
his
brother
tried
to
reform
gotham
court
is
the
head
too
of
the
citizens
union
which
is
the
whole
reform
programme
in
a
nutshell
all
of
which
is
as
it
ought
to
be
to
return
to
the
east
side
where
the
light
was
let
in
bone
alley
brought
dollars
under
the
auctioneer
hammer
alley
in
the
other
park
down
at
rutgers
square
where
the
police
clubbed
the
jewish
cloakmakers
a
few
years
ago
for
the
offence
of
gathering
to
assert
their
right
to
being
men
live
the
life
of
men
as
some
one
who
knew
summed
up
the
labor
movement
brought
only
seven
dollars
and
the
old
helvetia
house
where
boss
tweed
and
his
gang
met
at
night
to
plan
their
plundering
raids
on
the
city
treasury
was
knocked
down
for
five
kerosene
row
in
the
same
block
did
not
bring
enough
to
have
bought
kindling
wood
with
which
to
start
one
of
the
numerous
fires
that
gave
it
its
bad
name
it
was
in
thieves
alley
that
the
owner
in
the
days
long
gone
by
hung
out
the
sign
no
jews
need
apply
i
stood
and
watched
the
opening
of
the
first
municipal
playground
upon
the
site
of
the
old
alley
and
in
the
thousands
that
thronged
street
and
tenements
from
curb
to
roof
with
thunder
of
applause
there
were
not
twoscore
who
could
have
found
lodging
with
the
old
he
had
to
go
with
his
alley
before
the
better
day
could
bring
light
and
hope
to
the
tenth
ward
what
became
of
the
people
who
were
dispossessed
the
answer
to
that
is
the
reply
too
to
the
wail
that
goes
up
from
the
speculative
builder
every
time
we
put
the
screws
on
the
tenement
house
law
it
does
not
pay
him
to
build
any
more
he
says
but
when
the
multitudes
of
mulberry
bend
of
hester
street
and
of
the
bone
alley
park
were
put
out
there
was
more
than
room
enough
for
them
in
new
houses
ready
for
their
use
in
the
seventh
tenth
eleventh
thirteenth
and
seventeenth
wards
where
they
would
naturally
go
if
they
wanted
to
be
near
home
there
were
vacant
apartments
with
room
for
over
tenants
at
our
new
york
average
of
four
and
a
half
to
the
family
including
the
bend
the
whole
number
of
the
dispossessed
was
not
on
manhattan
island
there
were
at
that
time
more
than
vacant
flats
so
that
it
seems
those
builders
were
either
talking
through
their
hats
or
else
they
were
philanthropists
pure
and
simple
and
i
know
they
were
not
that
the
whole
question
of
rehousing
the
population
that
had
been
so
carefully
considered
abroad
made
us
no
trouble
though
it
gave
a
few
people
unnecessary
concern
the
unhoused
were
scattered
some
which
was
one
of
the
things
we
hoped
for
but
hardly
dared
believe
would
come
to
pass
many
of
them
as
it
appeared
had
remained
in
their
old
slum
more
from
force
of
habit
and
association
than
because
of
necessity
everything
takes
ten
years
said
abram
hewitt
when
exactly
ten
years
after
he
had
as
mayor
championed
the
small
parks
act
he
took
his
seat
as
chairman
of
the
advisory
committee
on
small
parks
the
ten
years
had
wrought
a
great
change
it
was
no
longer
the
slum
of
but
that
of
that
challenged
attention
the
committee
took
the
point
of
view
of
the
children
from
the
first
it
had
a
large
map
prepared
showing
where
in
the
city
there
was
room
to
play
and
where
there
was
none
then
it
called
in
the
police
and
asked
them
to
point
out
where
there
was
trouble
with
the
boys
and
in
every
instance
the
policeman
put
his
finger
upon
a
treeless
slum
they
have
no
other
playground
than
the
street
was
the
explanation
given
in
each
case
they
smash
lamps
and
break
windows
the
storekeepers
kick
and
there
is
trouble
that
is
how
it
begins
many
complaints
are
received
daily
of
boys
annoying
pedestrians
storekeepers
and
tenants
by
their
continually
playing
in
some
parts
of
almost
every
street
the
damage
is
not
slight
arrests
are
frequent
much
more
frequent
than
when
they
had
open
lots
to
play
in
this
last
was
the
report
of
an
captain
he
remembered
the
days
when
there
were
open
lots
there
but
those
lots
are
now
built
upon
he
said
and
for
every
new
house
there
are
more
boys
and
less
chance
for
them
to
play
the
committee
put
a
red
daub
on
the
map
to
indicate
trouble
then
it
asked
those
police
captains
who
had
not
spoken
to
show
them
where
their
precincts
were
and
why
they
had
no
trouble
every
one
of
them
put
his
finger
on
a
green
spot
that
marked
a
park
my
people
are
quiet
and
orderly
said
the
captain
of
the
tompkins
square
precinct
the
police
took
the
square
from
a
mob
by
storm
twice
in
my
recollection
and
the
commander
of
the
precinct
was
hit
on
the
head
with
a
hammer
by
his
people
and
laid
out
for
dead
the
hook
gang
is
gone
said
he
of
corlear
hook
the
professional
pursuit
of
that
gang
was
to
rob
and
murder
inoffensive
citizens
by
night
and
throw
them
into
the
river
and
it
achieved
a
bad
eminence
at
its
calling
illustration
mulberry
bend
park
the
whole
neighborhood
has
taken
a
change
and
decidedly
for
the
better
said
the
captain
of
mulberry
street
and
the
committee
rose
and
said
that
it
had
heard
enough
the
map
was
hung
on
the
wall
and
in
it
were
stuck
pins
to
mark
the
site
of
present
and
projected
schools
as
showing
where
the
census
had
found
the
children
crowding
the
moment
that
was
done
the
committee
sent
the
map
and
a
copy
of
chapter
of
the
laws
of
to
the
mayor
and
reported
that
its
task
was
finished
this
is
the
law
and
all
there
is
of
it
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
represented
in
senate
and
assembly
do
enact
as
follows
section
hereafter
no
schoolhouse
shall
be
constructed
in
the
city
of
new
york
without
an
playground
attached
to
or
used
in
connection
with
the
same
section
this
act
shall
take
effect
immediately
where
the
map
was
daubed
with
red
the
school
pins
crowded
one
another
on
the
lower
east
side
where
child
crime
was
growing
fast
and
no
less
than
three
storm
centres
were
marked
down
by
the
police
nine
new
schools
were
going
up
or
planned
and
in
the
precinct
whence
came
the
wail
about
the
ball
players
there
were
seven
it
was
common
sense
then
to
hitch
the
school
playground
and
the
children
together
it
seemed
a
happy
combination
for
the
new
law
had
been
a
to
the
school
commissioners
who
were
in
a
quandary
over
the
needful
size
of
an
playground
the
roof
garden
idea
which
was
at
the
start
a
measure
of
simple
economy
to
save
large
expenditure
for
land
had
suggested
a
way
out
but
there
was
the
long
vacation
when
schools
are
closed
and
children
most
in
need
of
a
chance
to
play
to
get
the
playground
on
the
roof
of
the
school
house
recognized
as
the
seemed
a
long
step
toward
turning
it
into
a
general
neighborhood
evening
resort
that
should
be
always
open
and
so
towards
bringing
school
and
people
and
especially
the
school
and
the
boy
together
in
a
bond
of
mutual
sympathy
good
for
them
both
illustration
roof
playground
on
a
public
school
that
was
the
burden
of
the
committee
report
it
made
thirteen
recommendations
besides
as
to
the
location
of
parks
and
detached
playgrounds
only
two
of
which
have
been
adopted
to
date
but
that
is
of
less
account
as
also
was
the
information
imparted
to
me
as
secretary
of
the
committee
by
our
late
tammany
mayor
and
may
he
be
the
last
that
we
had
as
much
authority
as
a
committee
of
bootblacks
in
his
office
it
is
all
of
less
account
than
the
fact
that
the
field
has
at
last
been
studied
and
its
needs
been
made
known
the
rest
will
follow
with
or
without
the
politician
authority
one
of
the
two
suggestions
carried
out
was
for
a
riverside
park
in
the
region
on
the
west
side
where
the
federation
of
churches
and
christian
workers
found
saloon
social
ideals
minting
themselves
upon
the
minds
of
the
people
at
the
rate
of
seven
saloon
thoughts
to
one
educational
thought
it
is
at
the
foot
of
west
street
has
been
a
playground
these
three
years
in
the
charge
of
the
outdoor
recreation
league
and
it
is
recorded
with
pride
by
the
directors
that
not
a
board
was
stolen
from
the
long
fence
that
encloses
it
in
all
that
time
while
fences
all
about
were
ripped
to
pieces
boards
have
a
market
value
in
that
neighborhood
and
private
property
was
not
always
highly
regarded
but
this
is
the
children
that
is
why
within
a
year
now
the
bluff
upon
which
the
playground
is
will
have
been
laid
out
as
a
beautiful
park
and
a
bar
set
to
the
slum
in
that
quarter
where
it
already
had
got
a
firm
grip
hard
by
there
is
a
recreation
pier
and
on
summer
evenings
the
young
men
of
the
neighborhood
may
be
seen
trooping
riverward
with
their
girls
to
hear
the
music
the
gang
that
laid
out
two
policemen
to
my
knowledge
has
gone
out
of
business
the
plans
are
sometimes
upset
by
surprising
snags
we
had
planned
for
two
municipal
playgrounds
on
the
east
side
where
the
need
is
greatest
and
our
plans
were
eagerly
accepted
by
the
city
authorities
but
they
were
never
put
into
practice
a
negligent
attorney
killed
one
a
lazy
clerk
the
other
and
both
served
under
the
reform
government
the
first
of
the
two
playgrounds
was
to
have
been
in
rivington
street
adjoining
the
new
public
bath
where
the
boys
for
want
of
something
better
to
do
were
fighting
daily
battles
with
stones
to
the
great
damage
of
windows
and
the
worse
aggravation
of
the
householders
four
hundred
children
in
that
neighborhood
petitioned
the
committee
for
a
place
of
their
own
where
there
were
no
windows
to
break
and
we
found
one
it
was
only
after
the
proceedings
had
been
started
that
we
discovered
that
they
had
been
taken
under
the
wrong
law
and
the
money
spent
in
advertising
had
been
wasted
it
was
then
too
late
the
daily
assaults
upon
the
windows
were
resumed
the
other
case
was
an
attempt
to
establish
a
model
school
park
in
a
block
where
more
than
four
thousand
children
attended
day
and
night
school
the
public
school
and
the
which
divided
the
children
between
them
were
to
be
allowed
to
stand
at
opposite
ends
of
the
block
the
surrounding
tenements
were
to
be
torn
down
to
make
room
for
a
park
and
playground
which
should
embody
the
ideal
of
what
such
a
place
ought
to
be
in
the
opinion
of
the
committee
for
the
roof
garden
was
not
in
the
original
plan
except
as
an
alternative
of
the
playground
where
land
came
too
high
the
plentiful
supply
of
light
and
air
the
safety
from
fire
to
be
obtained
by
putting
the
school
in
a
park
beside
the
fact
that
it
could
thus
be
built
beautiful
were
considerations
of
weight
plans
were
made
and
there
was
great
rejoicing
in
essex
street
until
it
came
out
that
this
scheme
had
gone
the
way
of
the
other
the
clerk
who
should
have
filed
the
plans
in
the
register
office
left
that
duty
to
some
one
else
and
it
took
just
days
to
make
the
journey
a
distance
of
five
hundred
feet
or
less
the
greater
new
york
had
come
then
with
tammany
and
the
thing
was
not
heard
of
again
when
i
traced
the
failure
down
to
the
clerk
in
question
and
told
him
that
he
had
killed
the
park
he
yawned
and
said
yes
and
i
think
it
is
just
as
well
it
is
dead
we
have
any
money
for
those
things
it
is
very
nice
to
have
small
parks
and
very
nice
to
have
a
horse
and
wagon
if
you
can
afford
it
but
we
ca
why
there
is
enough
to
run
the
city
government
so
the
labor
of
weary
weeks
and
months
in
the
children
behalf
was
all
undone
by
a
clerk
in
an
executive
office
but
he
saved
the
one
thing
he
had
in
mind
the
city
government
is
run
to
date
and
his
pay
is
secure
it
is
a
pity
to
have
to
confess
it
but
it
was
not
the
only
time
reform
in
office
gave
its
cause
a
black
eye
in
the
sight
of
the
people
the
hamilton
fish
park
that
took
the
place
of
bone
alley
was
laid
out
with
such
lack
of
sense
that
it
will
have
to
be
worked
all
over
again
the
gymnasium
and
bath
in
it
that
cost
i
am
told
was
never
of
any
use
for
either
purpose
and
was
never
opened
a
policeman
sat
in
the
door
and
turned
people
away
while
around
the
corner
clamoring
crowds
besieged
the
new
public
bath
i
spoke
of
there
were
more
people
waiting
sitting
on
the
steps
and
strung
out
halfway
through
the
block
when
i
went
over
to
see
one
july
day
than
could
have
found
room
in
three
buildings
like
it
so
also
after
seven
years
the
promised
park
down
by
the
schiff
fountain
called
seward
park
lies
still
an
unlovely
waste
waiting
to
be
made
beautiful
tammany
let
its
heelers
build
shanties
in
it
to
sell
fish
and
and
such
in
reform
just
let
things
be
no
matter
how
bad
they
were
and
broke
its
promises
to
the
people
no
that
is
not
fair
there
was
enough
to
do
besides
to
straighten
up
things
tammany
had
seen
to
that
this
very
day
the
contractor
men
are
beginning
work
in
seward
park
which
shall
give
that
most
crowded
spot
on
earth
its
and
i
have
warrant
for
promising
that
within
a
year
not
only
will
the
park
be
restored
but
and
the
thomas
jefferson
park
in
little
italy
which
are
still
dreary
wastes
be
opened
to
the
people
while
from
the
civic
club
in
richard
croker
old

comes
the
broad
hint
that
unless

and
it
took
just
about
seven
weeks
to
build
it
when
we
got
so
far

then
we
learned
more
in
one
day
than
we
had
dreamed
of
in
the
seven
years
half
the
east
side
swarmed
over
it
with
shrieks
of
delight
and
carried
the

had
come
to

the

fairly
off

now
that

has
more
than
seven

handsome
structures
seven
hundred

long
some
of
them
with

made

distinguished

said
at

this
spring
that
it

to
blame
with

for
sowing
the
seeds
of
that
fatal
disease
in
the
bodies
i
kept
the
police
slips
of
a
single
day
in
may
two
years
ago
when
four
little
ones
were
killed
and
three
crushed
under
the
wheels
of
trucks
in
tenement
streets
that
was
unusual
but
no
day
has
passed
in
my
recollection
that
has
not
had
its
record
of
accidents
which
bring
grief
as
deep
and
lasting
to
the
humblest
home
as
if
it
were
the
pet
of
some
mansion
on
fifth
avenue
that
was
slain
in
the
hudson
guild

west
side

have
the
reports
of
ten
children
that
were
killed
in
the
street
immediately
around
there
the
kindergarten
teaching
has
borne
fruit
private
initiative
set
the
pace
but
the
playground
idea
has
at
last
been
engrafted
upon
the
municipal
plan
the
outdoor
recreation
league
was
organized
by
citizens
including
many
amateur
athletes
and
enthusiastic
women
with
the
object
of
obtaining
recognition
of
the
necessity
for
recreation
and
physical
exercise
as
fundamental
to
the
moral
and
physical
welfare
of
the
people
together
with
the
school
reform
club
and
the
federation
of
churches
and
christian
workers
it
maintained
a
playground
on
the
west
side
where
the
ball
came
into
play
for
the
first
time
as
a
recognized
factor
in
civic
progress
the
day
might
well
be
kept
for
all
time
among
those
that
mark
human
emancipation
for
it
was
social
reform
and
christian
work
in
one
of
the
kind
that
tells
illustration
the
east
river
park
only
the
year
before
the
athletic
clubs
had
vainly
craved
the
privilege
of
establishing
a
gymnasium
in
the
east
river
park
where
the
children
wistfully
eyed
the
sacred
grass
and
cowered
under
the
withering
gaze
of
the
policeman
a
friend
whose
house
stands
opposite
the
park
found
them
one
day
swarming
over
her
stoop
in
such
shoals
that
she
could
not
enter
and
asked
them
why
they
did
not
play
tag
under
the
trees
instead
the
instant
shout
came
back
the
cop
wo
let
us
and
now
even
poverty
gap
is
to
have
its
playground
poverty
gap

was
partly
transformed

its
one
brief
season
experience
with
its
holy
terror

a
dreary
sand
lot
upon
the
site
of
the
old
tenements
in
which
the
alley
gang
murdered
the
one
good
boy
in
the

for
the
offence
of
supporting
his
aged

by
his

that
had
any
claim
upon
the
name
and
that
was
only
a
little
asphalted
strip
behind
a
public
school
in
first
street
was
an
old
graveyard
we
struggled
vainly
to
get
possession
of
another
long
abandoned
but
the
dead
were
of
more
account
than
the
living
footnote
the
name
bestowed
upon
it
by
the
older
toughs
before
the
fact
not
after
illustration
the
seward

but
now
at
last
it
is
their
turn
i
watched
the
crowds
at
their
play
where
seward
park
is
to
be
the
outdoor
recreation
league
had
put
up
gymnastic
apparatus
and
the
dusty
square
was
jammed
with
a
mighty
multitude
it
was
not
an
ideal
spot
for
it
had
not
rained
in
weeks
and
powdered
sand
and
cinders
had
taken
wing
and
floated
like
a
pall
over
the
perspiring
crowd
but
it
was
heaven
to
them
a
hundred
men
and
boys
stood
in
line
waiting
their
turn
upon
the
bridge
ladder
and
the
travelling
rings
that
hung
full
of
struggling
and
squirming
humanity
groping
madly
for
the
next
grip
no
failure
no
rebuff
discouraged
them
seven
boys
and
girls
rode
with
looks
of
deep
concern
it
is
their
way
upon
each
end
of
the
seesaw
and
two
squeezed
into
each
of
the
forty
swings
that
had
room
for
one
while
a
hundred
counted
time
and
saw
that
none
had
too
much
it
is
an
article
of
faith
with
these
children
that
nothing
that
is
going
for
their
benefit
is
to
be
missed
sometimes
the
result
provokes
a
smile
as
when
a
band
of
young
jews
starting
up
a
club
called
themselves
the
christian
heroes
it
was
meant
partly
as
a
compliment
i
suppose
to
the
ladies
that
gave
them
club
room
but
at
the
same
time
if
there
was
anything
in
a
name
they
were
bound
to
have
it
it
is
rather
to
cry
over
than
to
laugh
at
if
one
but
understands
it
the
sight
of
these
little
ones
swarming
over
a
sand
heap

scarcely
an
inch
of
it
was

sight

rapt
admiration
at

poor
show

a

geraniums

on
the
of

pathetic

extreme

stood
for
ten
minutes

crowded

back
many
times
at
the
enchanted
spot
as
long
as
it
was
in
sight
perhaps
there
was
in
it
on
the
part
of
the
children
at
least
just
a
little
bit
of
the
comforting
sense
of
proprietorship
they
had
contributed
of
their
scant
pennies
more
than
a
hundred
dollars
toward
the
opening
of
the
playground
and
they
felt
that
it
was
their
very
own
all
the
better

was

woman
alive

she

for
a
playground
for
her
poor

had
got
it

the
passing
of
cat
alley
when
santa
claus
comes
around
to
new
york
this
christmas
he
will
look
in
vain
for
some
of
the
slum
alleys
he
used
to
know
they
are
gone
where
some
of
them
were
there
are
shrubs
and
trees
and
greensward
the
sites
of
others
are
holes
and
hillocks
yet
that
by
and
by
when
all
the
official
red
tape
is
unwound
and
what
a
lot
of
it
there
is
to
plague
mankind
will
be
levelled
out
and
made
into
playgrounds
for
little
feet
that
have
been
aching
for
them
too
long
perhaps
it
will
surprise
some
good
people
to
hear
that
santa
claus
knew
the
old
alleys
but
he
did
i
have
been
there
with
him
and
i
knew
that
much
as
some
things
which
he
saw
there
grieved
him
the
starved
childhood
the
pinching
poverty
and
the
slovenly
indifference
that
cut
deeper
than
the
rest
because
it
spoke
of
hope
that
was
dead
yet
by
nothing
was
his
gentle
spirit
so
grieved
and
shocked
as
by
the
show
that
proposed
to
turn
his
holiday
into
a
battalion
drill
of
the
children
from
the
alleys
and
the
courts
for
patricians
young
and
old
to
review
it
was
well
meant
but
it
was
not
christmas
that
belongs
to
the
home
and
in
the
darkest
slums
santa
claus
found
homes
where
his
blessed
tree
took
root
and
shed
its
mild
radiance
about
dispelling
the
darkness
and
bringing
back
hope
and
courage
and
trust
they
are
gone
the
old
alleys
reform
wiped
them
out
it
is
well
santa
claus
will
not
have
harder
work
finding
the
doors
that
opened
to
him
gladly
because
the
light
has
been
let
in
and
others
will
stand
ajar
that
before
were
closed
the
chimneys
in
alleys
were
never
built
on
a
plan
generous
enough
to
let
him
in
in
the
orthodox
way

illustration
the

in
gotham
court
cat
alley
was
my
alley
it
was
mine
by
right
of
long
acquaintance
we
were
neighbors
for
twenty
years
yet
i
never
knew
why
it
was
called
cat
alley
there
was
the
usual
number
of
cats
gaunt
and
voracious
which
foraged
in
its
but
beyond
the
family
of
cats
that
presented
its
own
problem
of
heredity
the
kittens
took
it
from
the
mother
who
had
lost
one
leg
under
the
wheels
of
a
dray
there
was
nothing
specially
remarkable
about
them
it
was
not
an
alley
either
when
it
comes
to
that
but
rather
a
row
of
four
on
five
old
tenements
in
a
back
yard
that
was
reached
by
a
passageway
somewhat
less
than
three
feet
wide
between
the
sheer
walls
of
the
front
houses
these
had
once
had
pretensions
to
some
style
one
of
them
had
been
the
parsonage
of
the
church
next
door
that
had
by
turns
been
an
methodist
tabernacle
a
fashionable
negroes
temple
and
an
italian
mission
church
thus
marking
time
as
it
were
to
the
upward
movement
of
the
immigration
that
came
in
at
the
bottom
down
in
the
fourth
ward
fought
its
way
through
the
bloody
sixth
and
by
the
time
it
had
travelled
the
length
of
mulberry
street
had
acquired
a
local
standing
and
the
right
to
be
counted
and
rounded
up
by
the
political
bosses
now
the
old
houses
were
filled
with
newspaper
offices
and
given
over
to
perpetual
insomnia
and
sundays
night
or
day
they
never
slept
police
headquarters
was
right
across
the
way
and
kept
the
reporters
awake
from
his
window
the
chief
looked
down
the
narrow
passageway
to
the
bottom
of
the
alley
and
the
alley
looked
back
at
him
nothing
daunted
no
man
is
a
hero
to
his
valet
and
the
chief
was
not
an
autocrat
to
cat
alley
it
knew
all
his
human
weaknesses
could
tell
when
his
time
was
up
generally
before
he
could
and
winked
the
other
eye
with
the
captains
when
the
newspapers
spoke
of
his
having
read
them
a
severe
lecture
on
gambling
or
sunday
byrnes
it
worshipped
but
for
the
others
who
were
before
him
and
followed
after
it
cherished
a
neighborly
sort
of
contempt
in
the
character
of
its
population
cat
alley
was
properly
cosmopolitan
the
only
element
that
was
missing
was
the
native
american
and
in
this
it
was
representative
of
the
tenement
districts
in
america
chief
city
the
substratum
was
irish
of
volcanic
properties
upon
this
were
imposed
layers
of
german
french
jewish
and
italian
or
as
the
alley
would
have
put
it
dutch
sab√©
sheeny
and
dago
but
to
this
last
it
did
not
take
kindly
with
the
experience
of
the
rest
of
mulberry
street
before
it
it
foresaw
its
doom
if
the
dago
got
a
footing
there
and
within
a
month
of
the
moving
in
of
the
gio
family
there
was
an
eruption
of
the
basement
volcano
re√´nforced
by
the
sanitary
policeman
to
whom
complaint
had
been
made
that
there
were
too
many
ginnies
in
the
gio
flat
there
were
four
about
half
as
many
as
there
were
in
some
of
the
other
flats
when
the
item
of
house
rent
was
lessened
for
economic
reasons
but
it
covered
the
ground
the
flat
was
too
small
for
the
gios

the

dagos
out
they
go
and
they
went
up
on
the
third
floor
there
was
the
french
couple
it
was
another
of
the
contradictions
of
the
alley
that
of
this
pair
the
man
should
have
been
a
typical
stolid
german
she
a
mercurial
parisian
who
at
seventy
sang
the
marseillaise
with
all
the
spirit
of
the
commune
in
her
cracked
voice
and
hated
from
the
bottom
of
her
patriotic
soul
the
enemy
with
whom
the
irony
of
fate
had
yoked
her
however
she
improved
the

truly
french

said
with
a
grimace
as
her
nimble
fingers
fashioned
the

by
the

of

from
a
basket
she
supported
them
both
the
wares
were

with
tremendous
limbs

brief
skirts
of
tricolor
gauze
ballerinas

hats
cunningly
made
to
look

for
these
she

the
ballerinas
were
of

country

reception
of

at

was
not
cordial
it
was
disposed
to
regard
as
a
hostile
act
the
circumstance
that
she
kept
a
special
holiday
of
which
nothing
was
known
except
from
her
statement
that
it
referred
to
the

called

proximity

unfavorable
judgment
was
suspended
and
it
was
agreed
that
without
a

the
bastard
fell
for
cause
wherein
the
alley
showed
its
sound
historical
judgment
by
such
moral
pressure

the
original
irish
stock
preserved
the
alley
for
its
own
quarrels
free
from
foreign
embroilments
these
quarrels
were
many
and
involved
when
was
to
be
dispossessed
and
insisted
in
her
cups
on
killing
the
housekeeper
as
a
necessary
preliminary
a
study
of
the
causes
that
led
to
the
feud
developed
the

normal
condition
had
the

gehegan

fed

gehegan
prudently
vouchsafed
no

had
succeeded
to
the
office
of
housekeeper
upon
the
death
of
miss
mahoney
an
ancient
spinster
who
had
collected
the
rents
since
the
days
of
the
riot
meaning
the
orange
riot
an
event
from
which
the
alley
reckoned
its
time
as
the
ancients
did
from
the
olympian
games
miss
mahoney
was
a
most
exemplary
and
worthy
old
lady
thrifty
to
a
fault
indeed
it
was
said
when
she
was
gone
that
she
had
literally
starved
herself
to
death
to
lay
by
money
for
the
rainy
day
she
was
keeping
a
lookout
for
to
the
last
in
this
she
was
obeying
her
instincts
but
they
went
counter
to
those
of
the
alley
and
the
result
was
very
bad
as
an
example
miss
mahoney
life
was
a
failure
when
at
her
death
it
was
discovered
that
she
had
representing
a
total
of
two
thousand
dollars
her
nephew
and
only
heir
promptly
knocked
off
work
and
proceeded
to
celebrate
which
he
did
with
such
fervor
that
in
two
months
he
had
run
through
it
all
and
killed
himself
by
his
excesses
miss
mahoney
was
the
first
bank
account
in
the
alley
and
so
far
as
i
know
the
last
from
what
i
have
said
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
fighting
was
the
normal
occupation
of
cat
alley
it
was
rather
its
relaxation
from
unceasing
toil
and
care
from
which
no
held
promise
of
relief
there
was
a
deal
of
good
humor
in
it
at
most
times
scrapping
came
naturally
to
the
alley
when
as
was
sometimes
the
case
it
was
the
complement
of
a
wake
it
was
as
the
mirth
of
children
who
laugh
in
the
dark
because
they
are
afraid
but
once
an
occurrence
of
that
sort
scandalized
the
tenants
it
was
because
of
the
violation
of
the
monroe
doctrine
to
which
as
i
have
said
the
alley
held
most
firmly
with
severely
local
application
to
mulberry
street
mott
street
was
a
foreign
foe
from
which
no
interference
was
desired
or
long
endured
a
tenant
in
the
back
had
died
in
the
hospital
of
rheumatism
a
term
which
in
the
slums
sums
up
all
of
poverty
hardships
scant
and
poor
food
damp
rooms
and
hard
work
and
the
family
had
come
home
for
the
funeral
it
was
not
a
pleasant
the
father
in
his
day
had
been
strict
and
his
severity
had
driven
his
girls
to
the
street
they
had
landed
in
chinatown
with
all
that
implies
one
at
a
time
first
the
older
and
then
the
younger
whom
the
sister
took
under
her
wing
and
coached
she
was
very
handsome
was
the
younger
sister
with
an
innocent
look
in
her
blue
eyes
that
her
language
belied
and
smart
as
her
bore
witness
to
the
alley
where
the
proprieties
were
held
to
tenaciously
observed
it
and
forgave
all
the
rest
even
her
chink
husband
while
her
father
was
lying
ill
she
had
spent
a
brief
vacation
in
the
alley
now
that
he
was
dead
her
less
successful
sister
came
home
and
with
her
a
delegation
of
girls
from
chinatown
in
their
tawdry
finery
they
walked
in
sallow
and
bold
with
mott
street
and
the
accursed
pipe
written
all
over
them
defiant
of
public
opinion
yet
afraid
to
enter
except
in
a
body
the
alley
considered
them
from
behind
closed
blinds
while
the
children
stood
by
silently
to
see
them
pass
when
one
of
them
offered
one
of
the
kids
a
penny
he
let
it
fall
on
the
pavement
as
if
it
were
unclean
it
was
a
sore
thrust
and
it
hurt
cruelly
but
no
one
saw
it
in
her
face
as
she
went
in
where
the
dead
lay
with
scorn
and
hatred
as
her
offering
the
alley
had
withheld
audible
comment
with
a
tact
that
did
it
credit
but
when
at
night
mott
street
added
its
contingent
of
fellows
to
the
mourners
properly
concerned
in
the
wake
and
they
started
a
fight
among
themselves
that
was
unauthorized
by
local
sanction
its
wrath
was
aroused
and
it
arose
and
bundled
the
whole
concern
out
into
the
street
with
scant
ceremony
there
was
never
an
invasion
of
the
alley
after
that
night
it
enjoyed
home
rule
undisturbed
withal
there
was
as
much
kindness
of
heart
and
neighborly
charity
in
cat
alley
as
in
any
little
community
or
or
out
of
town
for
that
matter
it
had
its
standards
and
its
customs
which
were
to
be
observed
but
underneath
it
all
and
not
very
far
down
either
was
a
human
fellowship
that
was
capable
of
any
sacrifice
to
help
a
friend
in
need
many
was
the
widow
with
whom
and
with
whose
children
the
alley
shared
its
daily
bread
which
was
scanty
enough
god
knows
when
death
or
other
disaster
had
brought
her
to
the
place
in
twenty
years
i
do
not
recall
a
suicide
in
the
alley
or
a
case
of
suffering
demanding
the
interference
of
the
authorities
unless
with
such
help
as
the
hospital
could
give
the
alley
took
care
of
its
own
and
tided
them
over
the
worst
when
it
came
to
that
and
death
was
not
always
the
worst
i
remember
yet
with
a
shudder
a
tragedy
which
i
was
just
in
time
with
the
police
to
prevent
a
laborer
who
lived
in
the
attic
had
gone
mad
poisoned
by
the
stenches
of
the
sewers
in
which
he
worked
for
two
nights
he
had
been
pacing
the
hallway
muttering
incoherent
things
and
then
fell
to
sharpening
an
axe
with
his
six
children
playing
about
beautiful
girls
they
were
sweet
and
innocent
little
tots
in
five
minutes
we
should
have
been
too
late
for
it
appeared
that
the
man
madness
had
taken
on
the
homicidal
tinge
they
were
better
out
of
the
world
he
told
us
as
we
carried
him
off
to
the
hospital
when
he
was
gone
the
children
came
upon
the
alley
and
loyally
did
it
stand
by
them
until
a
job
was
found
for
the
mother
by
the
local
political
boss
he
got
her
appointed
at
the
city
hall
and
the
alley
always
faithful
was
solid
for
him
ever
after
organized
charity
might
and
indeed
did
provide
groceries
on
the
instalment
plan
the
tammany
captain
provided
the
means
of
pulling
the
family
through
and
of
bringing
up
the
children
although
there
was
not
a
vote
in
the
family
it
was
not
the
first
time
i
had
met
him
and
observed
his
plan
of
keeping
close
to
the
people
against
it
not
the
most
carping
reform
critic
could
have
found
just
ground
of
complaint
the
charity
of
the
alley
was
contagious
with
the
reporters
messenger
boys
a
lot
in
the
front
the
alley
was
not
on
good
terms
for
any
long
stretch
at
a
time
they
made
a
racket
at
night
and
had
sport
with
old
man
quinn
who
was
a
victim
of
dropsy
he
was
walking
on
dough
they
asseverated
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
explanation
of
the
alley
that
he
had
kidney
feet
but
when
the
old
man
died
and
his
wife
was
left
penniless
i
found
some
of
them
secretly
contributing
to
her
keep
it
was
not
so
long
after
that
that
another
old
pensioner
of
the
alley
suddenly
drawn
into
their
cyclonic
sport
in
the
narrow
passageway
fell
and
broke
her
arm
apparently
no
one
in
the
lot
was
individually
to
blame
it
was
an
unfortunate
accident
and
it
deprived
her
of
her
poor
means
of
earning
the
few
pennies
with
which
she
eked
out
the
charity
of
the
alley
worse
than
that
it
took
from
her
hope
after
death
as
it
were
for
years
she
had
pinched
and
saved
and
denied
herself
to
keep
up
a
payment
of
cents
a
week
which
insured
her
decent
burial
in
consecrated
ground
now
that
she
could
no
longer
work
the
dreaded
trench
in
the
potter
field
yawned
to
receive
her
that
was
the
blow
that
broke
her
down
she
was
put
out
by
the
landlord
soon
after
the
accident
as
a
hopeless
tenant
and
i
thought
that
she
had
gone
to
the
almshouse
when
by
chance
i
came
upon
her
living
quite
happily
in
a
tenement
on
the
next
block
living
is
hardly
the
word
she
was
really
waiting
to
die
but
waiting
with
a
cheerful
content
that
amazed
me
until
she
herself
betrayed
the
secret
of
it
every
week
one
of
the
messenger
boys
brought
her
out
of
his
scanty
wages
the
quarter
that
alike
insured
her
peace
of
mind
and
the
undisturbed
rest
of
her
body
in
its
long
sleep
which
a
life
of
toil
had
pictured
to
her
as
the
greatest
of
earth
boons
death
came
to
cat
alley
in
varying
forms
often
enough
as
a
welcome
relief
to
those
for
whom
it
called
rarely
without
its
dark
riddle
for
those
whom
it
left
behind
to
be
answered
without
delay
or
long
guessing
there
were
at
one
time
three
widows
with
little
children
in
the
alley
none
of
them
over
they
had
been
married
at
fifteen
or
sixteen
and
when
they
were
called
upon
to
face
the
world
and
fight
its
battles
alone
were
yet
young
and
inexperienced
girls
themselves
improvidence
yes
early
marriages
are
at
the
bottom
of
much
mischief
among
the
poor
and
yet
perhaps
these
and
others
like
them
might
have
offered
the
homes
from
which
they
went
out
as
a
valid
defence
to
their
credit
be
it
said
that
they
accepted
their
lot
bravely
and
with
the
help
of
the
alley
pulled
through
two
of
them
married
again
and
made
a
bad
job
of
it
second
marriages
seldom
turned
out
well
in
the
alley
they
were
a
refuge
of
the
women
from
work
that
was
wearing
their
lives
out
and
gave
them
in
exchange
usually
a
tyrant
who
hastened
the
process
there
never
was
any
sentiment
about
it
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
said
one
of
the
widows
to
me
when
at
last
it
was
decreed
that
the
tenements
were
to
be
pulled
down
unless
i
can
find
a
man
to
take
care
of
me
might
get
one
that
drinks
i
would
hammer
him
half
to
death
she
did
find
her
man
only
to
have
him
on
her
hands
too
it
was
the
last
straw
before
the
wreckers
came
around
she
was
dead
the
amazed
indignation
of
the
alley
at
the
discovery
of
her
second
marriage
which
till
then
had
been
kept
secret
was
beyond
bounds
the
supposed
widow
neighbor
across
the
hall
whom
we
knew
in
the
front
generally
as
the
fat
one
was
so
stunned
by
the
revelation
that
she
did
not
recover
in
season
to
go
to
the
funeral
she
was
never
afterward
the
same
illustration
the
wrecking
of
cat
alley
permission
of
the
century
in
the
good
old
days
when
the
world
was
right
the
fat
one
had
enjoyed
the
distinction
of
being
the
one
tenant
in
cat
alley
whose
growler
never
ran
dry
it
made
no
difference
how
strictly
sunday
law
was
observed
toward
the
rest
of
the
world
the
fat
one
would
set
out
from
the
alley
with
her
growler
in
a
basket
this
as
a
concession
to
the
unnatural
prejudices
of
a
misguided
community
not
as
an
evasion
for
she
made
a
point
of
showing
it
to
the
policeman
on
the
corner
and
return
with
it
filled
her
look
of
scornful
triumph
as
she
marched
through
the
alley
and
the
backward
toss
of
her
head
toward
police
headquarters
which
said
plainly
ha
you
thought
you
could
but
you
did
did
you
were
the
admiration
of
the
alley
it
allowed
that
she
had
met
and
downed
roosevelt
in
a
fair
fight
but
after
the
last
funeral
the
fat
one
never
again
carried
the
growler
her
spirit
was
broken
all
things
were
coming
to
an
end
the
alley
itself
with
them
one
funeral
i
recall
with
a
pleasure
which
the
years
have
in
no
way
dimmed
it
was
at
a
time
before
the
king
daughters
tenement
house
committee
was
organized
when
friends
used
to
send
flowers
to
my
office
for
the
poor
the
first
notice
i
had
of
a
death
in
the
alley
was
when
a
delegation
of
children
from
the
rear
knocked
and
asked
for
daisies
there
was
something
unnaturally
solemn
about
them
that
prompted
me
to
make
inquiries
and
then
it
came
out
that
old
walsh
was
dead
and
going
on
her
long
ride
up
to
hart
island
for
she
was
quite
friendless
and
the
of
the
alley
were
not
long
enough
to
save
her
from
the
potter
field
the
city
hearse
was
even
then
at
the
door
and
they
were
carrying
in
the
rough
pine
coffin
with
the
children
the
crippled
old
woman
had
been
a
favorite
she
had
always
a
kind
word
for
them
and
they
paid
her
back
in
the
way
they
knew
she
would
have
loved
best
not
even
the
coffin
of
the
police
sergeant
who
was
a
brother
of
the
district
leader
was
so
gloriously
decked
out
as
old
walsh
when
she
started
on
her
last
journey
the
children
stood
in
the
passageway
with
their
arms
full
of
daisies
and
gave
the
old
soul
a
departing
cheer
and
though
it
was
quite
irregular
it
was
all
right
for
it
was
well
meant
and
cat
alley
knew
it
they
were
much
like
other
children
those
of
the
alley
it
was
only
in
their
later
years
that
the
alley
and
the
growler
set
their
stamp
upon
them
while
they
were
small
they
loved
like
others
of
their
kind
to
play
in
the
gutter
to
splash
in
the
sink
about
the
hydrant
and
to
dance
to
the
that
came
regularly
into
the
block
even
though
they
sadly
missed
the
monkey
that
was
its
chief
attraction
till
the
aldermen
banished
it
in
a
cranky
fit
dancing
came
naturally
to
them
too
certainly
no
one
took
the
trouble
to
teach
them
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
them
stepping
to
the
time
on
the
broad
flags
at
the
mouth
of
the
alley
not
rarely
they
had
for
an
appreciative
audience
the
big
chief
himself
who
looked
down
from
his
window
and
the
uniformed
policeman
at
the
door
even
the
commissioners
deigned
to
smile
upon
the
impromptu
show
in
between
their
heavy
labors
in
the
cause
of
politics
and
pull
but
the
children
took
little
notice
of
them
they
were
too
happy
in
their
play
they
loved
my
flowers
too
with
a
genuine
love
that
did
not
spring
from
the
desire
to
get
something
for
nothing
and
the
parades
on
italian
that
always
came
through
the
street
they
took
a
fearsome
delight
in
watching
for
the
big
dime
museum
giant
who
lived
around
in
elizabeth
street
and
who
in
his
last
days
looked
quite
lean
and
hungry
enough
to
send
a
thrill
to
any
little
boy
heart
though
he
had
never
cooked
one
and
eaten
him
in
his
whole
life
being
quite
a
harmless
and
peaceable
giant
and
they
loved
trilby
illustration
trilby
permission
of
the
century
trilby
was
the
dog
as
far
back
as
my
memory
reaches
there
was
never
another
in
cat
alley
she
arrived
in
the
block
one
winter
morning
on
a
dead
run
with
a
tin
can
tied
to
her
stump
of
a
tail
and
with
the
mott
street
gang
in
hot
pursuit
in
her
extremity
she
saw
the
mouth
of
the
alley
dodged
in
and
was
safe
the
mott
streeters
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
following
her
into
police
headquarters
as
there
ever
after
she
stayed
she
took
possession
of
the
alley
and
of
headquarters
where
the
reporters
had
their
daily
walk
as
if
they
were
hers
by
right
of
conquest
which
in
fact
they
were
with
her
whimsically
grave
countenance
in
which
all
the
cares
of
the
vast
domain
she
made
it
her
daily
duty
to
oversee
were
visibly
reflected
she
made
herself
a
favorite
with
every
one
except
the
on
the
corner
who
denounced
her
angrily
when
none
of
her
friends
were
near
for
coming
in
with
his
customers
at
on
purpose
to
have
them
feed
her
with
his
sugar
which
was
true
at
regular
hours
beginning
with
the
opening
of
the
department
offices
she
would
make
the
round
of
the
police
building
and
call
on
all
the
officials
forgetting
none
she
rode
up
in
the
elevator
and
left
it
at
the
proper
floors
waited
in
the
anterooms
with
the
rest
when
there
was
a
crowd
and
paid
stated
visits
to
the
chief
and
the
commissioners
who
never
omitted
to
receive
her
with
a
nod
and
a
hello
trilby
no
matter
how
pressing
the
business
in
hand
the
gravity
with
which
she
listened
to
what
went
on
and
wrinkled
up
her
brow
in
an
evident
effort
to
understand
was
comical
to
the
last
degree
she
knew
the
fire
alarm
signals
and
when
anything
momentous
was
afoot
on
the
quiet
days
when
nothing
was
stirring
she
would
flock
with
the
reporters
on
the
stoop
and
sing
there
never
was
such
singing
as
trilby
that
was
how
she
got
her
name
i
tried
a
score
of
times
to
find
out
but
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
pain
or
pleasure
that
was
in
her
note
she
had
only
one
but
it
made
up
in
volume
for
what
it
lacked
in
range
standing
in
the
circle
of
her
friends
she
would
raise
her
head
until
her
nose
pointed
straight
toward
the
sky
and
pour
forth
her
melody
with
a
look
of
such
unutterable
woe
on
her
face
that
peals
of
laughter
always
wound
up
the
performance
whereupon
trilby
would
march
off
with
an
injured
air
and
hide
herself
in
one
of
the
offices
refusing
to
come
out
poor
trilby
with
the
passing
away
of
the
alley
she
seemed
to
lose
her
grip
she
did
not
understand
it
after
wandering
about
aimlessly
for
a
while
vainly
seeking
a
home
in
the
world
she
finally
moved
over
on
the
east
side
with
one
of
the
dispossessed
tenants
but
on
all
sundays
and
holidays
and
once
in
a
while
in
the
middle
of
the
week
she
comes
yet
to
inspect
the
old
block
in
mulberry
street
and
to
join
in
a
quartette
with
old
friends
illustration
old
barney
trilby
and
old
barney
were
the
two
who
stuck
to
the
alley
longest
barney
was
the
star
boarder
as
everything
about
the
place
was
misnamed
the
alley
itself
included
so
was
he
his
real
name
was
michael
but
the
children
called
him
barney
and
the
name
stuck
when
they
were
at
odds
as
they
usually
were
they
shouted
barney
bluebeard
after
him
and
ran
away
and
hid
in
trembling
delight
as
he
shook
his
at
them
and
showed
his
teeth
with
the
evil
leer
which
he
reserved
specially
for
them
it
was
reported
in
the
alley
that
he
was
a
hence
the
name
certain
it
is
that
he
never
would
let
one
of
the
detested
sex
cross
the
threshold
of
his
attic
room
on
any
pretext
if
he
caught
one
pointing
for
his
aerie
he
would
block
the
way
and
bid
her
sternly
begone
she
seldom
tarried
long
for
barney
was
not
a
pleasing
object
when
he
was
in
an
ugly
mood
as
the
years
passed
and
cobweb
and
dirt
accumulated
in
his
room
stories
were
told
of
fabulous
wealth
which
he
had
concealed
in
the
chinks
of
the
wall
and
in
broken
crocks
and
as
he
grew
constantly
shabbier
and
more
crabbed
they
were
readily
believed
barney
carried
his
ring
and
filed
keys
all
day
coining
money
so
the
reasoning
ran
and
spent
none
so
he
must
be
hiding
it
away
the
alley
hugged
itself
in
the
joyful
sensation
that
it
had
a
miser
and
his
hoard
in
the
cockloft
next
to
a
ghost
for
which
the
environment
was
too
that
was
the
thing
for
an
alley
to
have
curiously
enough
the
fact
that
summer
and
winter
the
old
man
never
missed
early
mass
and
always
put
a
silver
quarter
even
a
silver
dollar
it
was
breathlessly
whispered
in
the
alley
in
the
contribution
box
merely
served
to
strengthen
this
belief
the
fact
was
i
suspect
that
the
was
the
biggest
end
of
the
business
old
barney
cultivated
so
assiduously
there
were
keys
enough
on
it
and
they
rattled
most
persistently
as
he
sent
forth
the
strange
whoop
which
no
one
ever
was
able
to
make
out
but
which
was
assumed
to
mean
keys
keys
but
he
was
far
too
feeble
and
tremulous
to
wield
a
file
with
effect
in
his
younger
days
he
had
wielded
a
bayonet
in
his
country
defence
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
could
be
made
to
talk
he
would
tell
with
a
smouldering
gleam
in
his
sunken
eyes
how
the
illinois
volunteers
had
battled
with
the
rebs
weary
nights
and
days
without
giving
way
a
foot
the
old
man
bent
back
would
straighten
and
he
would
step
firmly
and
proudly
at
the
recollection
of
how
he
and
his
comrades
earned
the
name
of
the
heroes
of
lexington
in
that
memorable
fight
but
only
for
the
moment
the
dark
looks
that
frightened
the
children
returned
soon
to
his
face
it
was
all
for
nothing
he
said
while
he
was
fighting
at
the
front
he
was
robbed
his
lieutenant
to
whom
he
gave
his
money
to
send
home
stole
it
and
ran
away
when
he
returned
after
three
years
there
was
nothing
nothing
at
this
point
the
old
man
always
became
incoherent
he
spoke
of
money
the
government
owed
him
and
withheld
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
whether
his
grievance
was
real
or
imagined
when
colonel
grant
came
to
mulberry
street
as
a
police
commissioner
barney
brightened
up
under
a
sudden
idea
he
might
get
justice
now
once
a
week
through
those
two
years
he
washed
himself
to
the
mute
astonishment
of
the
alley
and
brushed
up
carefully
to
go
across
and
call
on
the
general
son
in
order
to
lay
his
case
before
him
but
he
never
got
farther
than
the
mulberry
street
door
on
the
steps
he
was
regularly
awestruck
and
the
old
hero
who
had
never
turned
his
back
to
the
enemy
faltered
and
retreated
in
the
middle
of
the
street
he
halted
faced
front
and
saluted
the
building
with
all
the
solemnity
of
a
grenadier
on
parade
then
went
slowly
back
to
his
attic
and
to
his
unrighted
grievance
it
had
been
the
talk
of
the
neighborhood
for
years
that
the
alley
would
have
to
go
in
the
elm
street
widening
which
was
to
cut
a
swath
through
the
block
right
over
the
site
upon
which
it
stood
and
at
last
notice
was
given
about
christmas
time
that
the
wreckers
were
coming
the
alley
was
sold
thirty
dollars
was
all
it
brought
and
the
old
tenants
moved
away
and
were
scattered
to
the
four
winds
barney
alone
stayed
he
flatly
refused
to
budge
they
tore
down
the
church
next
door
and
the
buildings
on
houston
street
and
filled
what
had
been
the
yard
or
court
of
the
tenements
with
d√©bris
that
reached
halfway
to
the
roof
so
that
the
old
locksmith
if
he
wished
to
go
out
or
in
must
do
so
by
way
of
the
window
over
a
perilous
path
of
shaky
timbers
and
sliding
brick
he
evidently
considered
it
a
kind
of
siege
and
shut
himself
in
his
attic
bolting
and
barring
the
door
and
making
secret
sorties
by
night
for
provisions
when
the
chimney
fell
down
or
was
blown
over
he
punched
a
hole
in
the
rear
wall
and
stuck
the
stovepipe
through
that
where
it
blew
defiance
to
the
new
houses
springing
up
almost
within
of
it
it
suggested
guns
pointing
from
a
fort
and
perhaps
it
pleased
the
old
man
soldier
fancy
it
certainly
made
smoke
enough
in
his
room
where
he
was
fighting
his
battles
over
with
himself
and
occasionally
with
the
janitor
from
the
front
who
climbed
over
the
pile
of
bricks
and
in
through
the
window
to
bring
him
water
when
i
visited
him
there
one
day
and
after
giving
the
password
got
behind
the
bolted
door
i
found
him
the
room
and
everything
else
absolutely
covered
with
soot
from
roof
to
rafters
the
password
was
letter
yelled
out
loud
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
that
would
always
bring
him
out
in
the
belief
that
the
government
had
finally
sent
him
the
money
barney
was
stubbornly
defiant
he
would
stand
by
his
guns
to
the
end
but
he
was
weakening
physically
under
the
combined
effect
of
short
rations
and
nightly
alarms
it
was
clear
that
he
could
not
stand
it
much
longer
the
wreckers
cut
it
short
one
morning
by
ripping
off
the
roof
over
his
head
before
he
was
up
then
and
only
then
did
he
retreat
his
exit
was
characterized
by
rather
more
haste
than
dignity
there
had
been
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
overnight
and
barney
slid
down
the
jagged
slope
from
his
window
dragging
his
trunk
with
him
in
imminent
peril
of
breaking
his
aged
bones
that
day
he
disappeared
from
mulberry
street
i
thought
he
was
gone
for
good
and
through
the
grand
army
of
the
republic
had
set
inquiries
on
foot
to
find
what
had
become
of
him
when
one
day
i
saw
him
from
my
window
standing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
in
hand
and
looking
fixedly
at
what
had
once
been
the
passageway
to
the
alley
but
was
now
a
barred
gap
between
the
houses
leading
nowhere
he
stood
there
long
gazing
sadly
at
the
gateway
at
the
children
dancing
to
the
italian
at
trilby
trying
to
look
unconcerned
on
the
stoop
and
then
went
his
way
silently
a
poor
castaway
and
i
saw
him
no
more
so
cat
alley
with
all
that
belonged
to
it
passed
out
of
my
life
it
had
its
faults
but
it
can
at
least
be
said
of
it
in
extenuation
that
it
was
very
human
with
them
all
it
had
a
rude
sense
of
justice
that
did
not
distinguish
its
early
builders
when
the
work
of
tearing
down
had
begun
i
watched
one
day
a
troop
of
children
having
fun
with
a
seesaw
they
had
made
of
a
plank
laid
across
a
lime
barrel
the
whole
irish
contingent
rode
the
plank
all
at
once
with
screams
of
delight
a
ragged
little
girl
from
the
despised
dago
colony
watched
them
from
the
corner
with
hungry
eyes
big
jane
who
was
the
leader
by
virtue
of
her
thirteen
years
and
her
long
reach
saw
her
and
stopped
the
show
here

she
said
pushing
one
of
the
smaller
girls
from
the
plank
you
get
off
an
let
her
ride
her
mother
was
stabbed
yesterday
and
the
little
dago
rode
and
was
made
happy
chapter
xiii
justice
to
the
boy
sometimes
when
i
see
my
little
boy
hugging
himself
with
delight
at
the
near
prospect
of
the
kindergarten
i
go
back
in
memory
forty
years
and
more
to
the
day
when
i
was
dragged
a
howling
captive
to
school
as
a
punishment
for
being
bad
at
home
i
remember
as
though
it
were
yesterday
my
progress
up
the
street
in
the
vengeful
grasp
of
an
exasperated
servant
and
my
reception
by
the
aged
monster
most
fitly
named
madame
bruin
who
kept
the
school
she
asked
no
questions
but
led
me
straightway
to
the
cellar
where
she
plunged
me
into
an
empty
barrel
and
put
the
lid
on
over
me
applying
her
horn
goggles
to
the
bunghole
to
my
abject
terror
she
informed
me
in
a
sepulchral
voice
that
that
was
the
way
bad
boys
were
dealt
with
in
school
when
i
ceased
howling
from
sheer
fright
she
took
me
out
and
conducted
me
to
the
yard
where
a
big
hog
had
a
corner
to
itself
she
bade
me
observe
that
one
of
its
ears
had
been
slit
half
its
length
it
was
because
the
hog
was
lazy
and
little
boys
who
were
that
way
minded
zip
she
clipped
a
pair
of
tailor
shears
close
to
my
ear
it
was
my
first
lesson
in
school
i
hated
it
from
that
hour
the
barrel
and
the
hog
were
never
part
of
the
curriculum
in
any
american
boy
school
i
suppose
they
seem
too
freakish
to
be
credited
to
any
but
the
demoniac
ingenuity
of
my
home
ogre
but
they
stood
for
a
comprehension
of
the
office
of
school
and
teacher
which
was
not
patented
by
any
day
or
land
it
is
not
so
long
since
the
notion
yet
prevailed
that
the
schools
were
principally
to
lock
children
up
in
for
the
convenience
of
their
parents
that
we
should
have
entirely
forgotten
it
only
the
other
day
a
clergyman
from
up
the
state
came
into
my
office
to
tell
of
a
fine
reform
school
they
had
in
his
town
they
were
very
proud
of
it
and
how
about
the
schools
for
the
good
boys
in
your
town
i
asked
when
i
had
heard
him
out
are
they
anything
to
be
proud
of
he
stared
he
guessed
they
were
all
right
he
said
after
some
hesitation
but
it
was
clear
that
he
did
not
know
illustration
the
old
illustration
the
new
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
back
forty
years
to
find
us
in
the
metropolis
upon
the
clergyman
platform
if
not
upon
madame
bruin
a
dozen
or
fifteen
will
do
they
will
bring
us
to
the
day
when
roof
playgrounds
were
contemptuously
left
out
of
the
estimates
for
an
east
side
school
as
frills
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
education
when
the
board
of
health
found
but
a
single
public
school
in
more
than
sixscore
that
was
so
ventilated
as
to
keep
the
children
from
being
poisoned
by
foul
air
when
the
authority
of
the
talmud
had
to
be
invoked
by
the
superintendent
of
school
buildings
to
convince
the
president
of
the
board
of
education
who
happened
to
be
a
jew
that
or
eighty
pupils
were
far
too
many
for
one
classroom
when
a
man
who
had
been
dead
a
year
was
appointed
a
school
trustee
of
the
third
ward
under
the
mouldy
old
law
surviving
from
the
day
when
new
york
was
a
big
village
and
filled
the
office
as
well
as
if
he
had
been
alive
because
there
were
no
schools
in
his
ward
it
was
the
wholesale
grocery
district
when
manual
training
and
the
kindergarten
were
yet
the
fads
of
yesterday
looked
at
askance
when
fifty
thousand
children
roamed
the
streets
for
whom
there
was
no
room
in
the
schools
and
the
only
defence
of
the
school
commissioners
was
that
they
did
know
there
were
so
many
and
when
we
mixed
truants
and
thieves
in
a
jail
with
entire
unconcern
indeed
the
jail
filled
the
title
r√¥le
in
the
educational
cast
of
that
day
its
inmates
were
well
lodged
and
cared
for
while
the
sanitary
authorities
twice
condemned
the
essex
market
school
across
the
way
as
wholly
unfit
for
children
to
be
in
but
failed
to
catch
the
ear
of
the
politician
who
ran
things
unhindered
when
in
i
denounced
the
system
of
enforcing
or
not
enforcing
the
compulsory
education
law
as
a
device
to
make
thieves
out
of
our
children
by
turning
over
their
training
to
the
street
he
protested
angrily
but
the
experts
of
the
tenement
house
commission
found
the
charge
fully
borne
out
by
the
facts
they
were
certainly
plain
enough
in
the
sight
of
us
all
had
we
chosen
to
see
when
at
last
we
saw
we
gave
the
politician
a
vacation
for
a
season
to
say
that
he
was
to
blame
for
all
the
mischief
would
not
be
fair
we
were
to
blame
for
leaving
him
in
possession
he
was
only
a
link
in
the
chain
which
our
indifference
had
forged
but
he
was
always
and
everywhere
an
obstruction
to
betterment
sometimes
illogically
in
spite
of
himself
successive
tammany
mayors
had
taken
a
stand
for
the
public
schools
when
it
was
clear
that
reform
could
not
be
delayed
much
longer
but
they
were
helpless
against
a
system
of
selfishness
and
stupidity
of
which
they
were
the
creatures
though
they
posed
as
its
masters
they
had
to
go
with
it
as
unfit
and
upon
the
wave
that
swept
out
the
last
of
the
rubbish
came
reform
the
committee
of
seventy
took
hold
the
good
government
clubs
the
tenement
house
commission
and
the
women
of
new
york
five
years
we
strove
with
the
powers
of
darkness
and
look
now
at
the
change
the
new
york
school
system
is
not
yet
the
ideal
one
it
may
never
be
but
the
jail
at
least
has
been
cast
out
of
the
firm
we
have
a
compulsory
education
law
under
which
it
is
possible
to
punish
the
parent
for
the
boy
truancy
as
he
ought
to
be
if
there
was
room
in
the
school
for
the
lad
and
he
let
him
drift
and
the
day
can
not
be
delayed
much
longer
now
when
every
child
shall
find
the
latchstring
out
on
the
school
door
we
have
had
to
put
our
hands
deep
into
our
pockets
to
get
so
far
and
we
shall
have
to
put
them
in
deeper
yet
a
long
way
but
it
is
all
right
we
are
beginning
to
see
the
true
bearing
of
things
last
week
the
board
of
estimate
and
apportionment
appropriated
six
millions
of
dollars
for
new
schools
exactly
what
the
battleship
cost
all
complete
with
guns
and
fittings
so
they
told
me
on
board
battleships
are
all
right
when
we
need
them
but
even
then
it
is
the
man
behind
the
gun
who
tells
and
that
means
the
schoolmaster
the
board
of
education
asked
for
sixteen
millions
they
will
get
the
other
ten
when
we
have
caught
our
breath
since
the
beginning
of
we
have
built
new
public
schools
in
manhattan
and
the
bronx
at
a
cost
of
exclusive
of
cost
of
sites
furnishings
heating
lighting
and
ventilating
the
buildings
which
would
add
at
least
of
that
amount
making
it
a
round
twenty
millions
of
dollars
and
every
one
of
the
has
its
playground
which
will
by
and
by
be
free
to
all
the
neighborhood
the
idea
is
at
last
working
through
that
the
schools
belong
to
the
people
and
are
primarily
for
the
children
and
their
parents
not
mere
vehicles
of
ward
patronage
or
for

with

loudly
proclaiming
the
collapse

anybody

it

of

said

our

we
kept
account
of
the

you
brought
from
out
of

and
who
spent
the
money
they
made
here
out
of

and
it
got
to
be
the
talk
among
the
tenement
people
in
my
ward
that
their
daughters
would
have
no
more
show
to
get
to
be
teachers
that
did
the
business
we
figured
the
school
vote
in

at

and
i
knew
we
could
not
lose
the
foreigners
were
teachers
from
massachusetts
and
other
states
who
had
achieved
a
national
reputation
at
their
work
there
lies
upon
my
table
a
copy
of
the
minutes
of
the
board
of
education
of
january
in
which
is
underscored
a
report
on
a
primary
school
in

it
is
a
wooden
shanty
is
the
inspector
account
heated
by
stoves
and
is
a
regular
tinder
box
cellar
wet
and
under
one
classroom
only
this
building
was
erected
in
order
i
believe
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
school
population
in
the
neighborhood
to
warrant
the
purchase
of
property
to
erect
a
school
on

no
showing

on

that
was
the
way
then
of
taking
a
school
census
and
the
result
was
the
utter
failure
of
the
compulsory
education
law
to
compel
anything
we
have
a
biennial
census
ordained
by
law
which
when
at
last
it
gets
into
the
hands
of
some
one
who
can
count
will
tell
us
how
many
jacob
beresheims
are
drifting
upon
the
shoals
of
the
street
and
we
have
a
truant
school
to
keep
them
safe
in
to
it
says
the
law
no
thief
shall
be
committed
it
is
not
yet
five
years
since
the
burglar
and
the
truant
which
latter
having
been
refused
admission
to
the
school
because
there
was
not
room
for
him
inconsequently
was
locked
up
for
contracting

asylum

classified
there
in

of
those
who
were
four

four

and
over
four
feet
seven
i
am
afraid
i
scandalized
some
good
people
during
the
fight
for
decency
in
this
matter
by
insisting
that
it
ought
to
be
considered
a
good
mark
for
jacob
that
he
despised
such
schools
as
were
provided
for
him
but
it
was
true
except
for
the
risk
of
the
burglar
the
jail
was
preferable
by
far
the
woman
into
whose
hands
the
management
of
the
truant
school
fell
made
out
after
little
more
than
a
year
experience
that
of
hundred
incorrigibles
the
barest
handful
scarce
sixty
were
rightly
so
named
and
even
these
a
little
longer
and
tighter
grip
might
probably
win
over
for
such
a
farm
school
is
yet
to
be
provided
the
rest
responded
promptly
to
an
appeal
to
their
pride
she
made
it
a
personal
matter
with
each
of
them
and
the
truant
vanished
the
boy
was
restored
the
burglar
too
made
it
a

matter
in

the
result
was
two
burglars
for
one
i
have
yet
to
find
any
one
who
has
paid
attention
to
this
matter
and
is
not
of
the
opinion
that
the
truant
school
strikes
at
the
root
of
the
problem
of
juvenile
crime
after
thirty
years
of
close
acquaintance
with
the
child
population
of
london
andrew
drew
chairman
of
the
industrial
committee
of
the
school
board
declared
his
conviction
that
truancy
is
to
be
credited
with
nearly
the
whole
of
our
juvenile
criminality
but
for
years
there
seemed
to
be
no
way
of
convincing
the
new
york
school
board
that
the
two
had
anything
to
do
with
one
another
even
now
it
seems
to
be
a
case
of
one
convinced
against
his
will
being
of
the
same
opinion
still
for
though
the
superintendent
of
schools
speaks
of
that
bar
to
the
jail
as
preposterously
inadequate
nothing
is
done
to
strengthen
it
footnote
after
two
attempts
that
were
not
shining
successes
the
politicians
at
albany
and
new
york
calmly
dropped
the
matter
and
for
four
years
ignored
the
law
the
superintendent
of
schools
is
at
this
writing
june
preparing
to
have
the
police
take
the
child
census

which
it
is
hard
to
see
how
he
can
know

extent
of
the
problem

is

a
fair
index
of
the
number
of
those
anxious
to
get
in
but
they
tell
us
nothing
of
the
dangerous
class
who
shun
the
schools
nothing
on
that
tack
but
there
is
a
long
leg
and
a
short
leg
on
the
course
and
i
fancy
superintendent
snyder
does
the
tacking
on
the
long
leg
snyder

he
does
that
which
no

ever
did

tried

one
of

rare

who
open

for
the
soul
of

literally
he
found

where
he
is
leaving

to

if
any
one
thinks
this
is
overmeasure
of
praise
let
him
look
at
the
letter
h
school
now
become
a
type
and
see
what
he
thinks
of
it
the
idea
suggested
itself
to
him
as
meeting
the
demands
of
a
site
in
the
middle
of
a
block
while
he
was
poking
about
old
paris
on
a
vacation
and
now

stands
embodied
in

i
can
not
see
how
it
is
possible
to
come
nearer
perfection
in
the
building
of
a
public
school
there
is
not
a
dark
corner
in
the
whole
structure
from
the
splendid
gymnasium
under
the
roof
to
the
indoor
playground
on
the
street
floor
which
when
thrown
into
one
with
the
two
yards
that
lie
enclosed
in
the
arms
of
the
h
give
the
children
nearly
an
acre
of
asphalted
floor
to
romp
on
from
street
to
street
for
the
building
sets
right
through
the
block
with
just
such
a
front
on
the
other
street
as
it
shows
on
this
one
if
there
be
those
yet
upon
whom
the
notion
grates
that
play
and
the
looks
of
the
school
should
be
counted
in
as
educational
factors
why
let
them
hurry
up
and
catch
on
they
are
way
behind
the
play
through
which
the
child
first
perceives
moral
relations
comes
near
being
the
biggest
and
strongest
factor
in
it
all
and
as
for
the
five
or
ten
thousand
dollars
put
in
for
the
looks
of
things
where
the
slum
had
trodden
every
ideal
and
every
atom
of
beauty
into
the
dirt
i
expect
to
live
to
see
that
prove
the
best
investment
a
city
ever
made
we
are
getting
the
interest
now
in
the
new
pride
of
the
boy
in
his
school
and
no
wonder
when
i
think
of
the
old
allen
street
school
with
its
hard
and
ugly
lines
where
the
gas
had
to
be
kept
burning
even
on
the
brightest
days
recitations
suspended
every
and
the
children
made
to
practice
calisthenics
so
that
they
should
not
catch
cold
while
the
windows
were
opened
to
let
in
fresh
air
of
the
dark
playground
downstairs
with
the
rats
keeping
up
such
a
racket
that
one
could
hardly
hear
himself
speak
at
times
or
of
that
other
east
side
playground
where
the
boys
were
allowed
to
speak
above
a
whisper
so
as
not
to
disturb
those
studying
overhead
i
fancy
that
i
can
make
out
both
the
cause
and
the
cure
of
the
boy
desperation
we
try
to
make
our
schools
pleasant
enough
to
hold
the
children
wrote
the
superintendent
of
schools
in
indianapolis
to
me
once
and
added
that
they
had
no
truant
problem
worth
bothering
about
with
the
kindergarten
and
manual
training

ingrafted
upon
the
school
course

are

with
it
reaching
out
to

be
willing
to
turn

the
reform
in

building
dates
back
as
does
every
other
reform
in
new
york
to
the
mulberry
bend
it
began
there
the
first
school
that
departed
from
the
soulless
old
tradition
to
set
beautiful
pictures
before
the
child
mind
as
well
as
dry
figures
on
the
slate
was
built
there
at
the
time
i
wanted
it
to
stand
in

park
hoping
so
to
hasten
the
laying
out
of
that
but
although
the
small

expressly
permitted
the
erection
on

of
buildings
for
the
instruction
of
the
people
the
officials
upon

i
pressed
my
scheme
could
not
be
made
to
understand
that
as
including

perhaps
they
were
right
i
catechised
fourth
ward
girls
in
a
sewing
school
about
that
time
of
whom
had
attended
the
public
schools
of
the
district
more
than
a
year
one
wore
a
badge
earned
for
excellence
in
her
studies
in
those
days
every
street
corner
was
placarded
with
big
posters
of
napoleon
on
a
white
horse
riding
through
fire
and
smoke
there
was
one
right
across
the
street
yet
only
one
of
the
knew
who
napoleon
was
she
thought
she
had
heard
of
the
gentleman
before
it
came
out
that
the
one
impression
she
retained
of
what
she
had
heard
was
that
the
gentleman
had
two
wives
both
at
one
time
probably
they
knew
of
washington
that
he
was
the
first
president
of
the
united
states
and
cut
down
a
cherry
tree
they
were
sitting
and
sewing
at
the
time
almost
on
the
identical
spot
on
cherry
hill
where
he
lived
when
he
held
the
office
to
the
question
who
ruled
before
washington
the
answer
came
promptly
no
one
he
was
the
first
they
agreed
reluctantly
upon
further
consideration
that
there
was
probably
a
king
of
america
before
his
day
and
the
irish
damsels
turned
up
their
noses
at
the
idea
the
people
of
canada
they
thought
were
the
same
winter
i
was
indignantly
bidden
to
depart
from
a
school
in
the
fourth
ward
by
a
trustee
who
had
heard
that
i
had
written
a
book
about
the
slum
and
spoken
of
his
people
in
it
those
early
steps
in
the
reform
path
stumbled
sadly
over
obstacles
that
showed
what
a
hard
pull
we
had
ahead
i
told
in
the
making
of
an
american
how
i
fared
when
i
complained
that
the
allen
street
school
was
overrun
with
rats
and
how
i
went
out
to
catch
one
of
them
to
prove
to
the
city
hall
folk
that
i
was
not
a
liar
as
they
said
we
won
the
fight
for
the
medical
inspection
of
the
schools
that
has
proved
such
a
boon
against
much
opposition
within
the
profession
from
which
we
should
have
had
only
support
and
this
in
face
of
evidence
of
a
kind
to
convince
anybody
i
remember
one
of
the
exhibits
there
had
been
a
epidemic
on
the
lower
west
side
which
the
health
inspectors
finally
traced
to
the
public
school
of
the
district
a
boy
with
the
disease
had
been
turned
loose
before
the
peeling
was
over
and
had
achieved
phenomenal
popularity
in
the
classroom
by
a
trick
he
had
of
pulling
the
skin
from
his
fingers
as
one
would
skin
a
cat
the
pieces
he
distributed
as
souvenirs
among
his
comrades
who
carried
them
proudly
home
to
show
to
their
admiring
playmates
who
were
not
so
lucky
as
to
sit
on
the
bench
with
the
clever
lad
the
epidemic
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
but
though
the
health
department
put
through
that
reform
when
it
came
to
inspecting
the
eyes
of
the
children
we
lost
the
cry
that
it
would
interfere
with
private
practice
defeated
us
the
fact
was
easily
demonstrated
that
not
only
was
ophthalmia
rampant
in
the
schools
with
its
contagion
but
that
the
pupils
were
made
both
and
stupid
by
the
want
of
proper
arrangement
of
their
seats
and
of
themselves
in
their
classrooms
but
prevailed
however
nothing
is
ever
settled
till
it
is
settled
right
i
have
before
me
the
results
of
an
examination
of
public
schools
containing
pupils
it
was
made
by
order
of
the
board
of
health
this
month
august
and
ought
to
settle
that
matter
for
good
of
the
not
less
than
had
contagious
were
cases
of
operative
trachoma
simple
trachoma
and
conjunctivitis
in
one
school
in
the
most
crowded
district
of
the
east
side
per
cent
were
so
afflicted
no
wonder
the
doctors
were
horrified
at
the
showing
so
was
the
president
of
the
board
of
health
who
told
me
that
he
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
until
effective
inspection
of
the
school
children
by
had
been
assured
so
we
go
step
by
step
ever
forward
speaking
of
that
reminds
me
of
a
mishap
i
had
in
the
hester
street
school
the
one
with
the
frills
which
the
board
of
education
cut
off
i
happened
to
pass
it
after
school
hours
and
went
in
to
see
what
sort
of
a
playground
the
roof
would
have
made
i
met
no
one
on
the
way
and
finding
the
scuttle
open
climbed
out
and
up
the
slant
of
the
roof
to
the
peak
where
i
sat
musing
over
our
lost
chance
when
the
janitor
came
to
close
up
he
must
have
thought
i
was
a
crazy
man
and
my
explanation
did
not
make
it
any
better
he
haled
me
down
and
but
for
the
fortunate
chance
that
the
policeman
on
the
beat
knew
me
i
should
have
been
taken
to
the
lockup
as
a
dangerous
lunatic
all
for
dreaming
of
a
playground

roof
of
a
schoolhouse

and

notwithstanding
the
dream
became
real
there
stands
another
school

within
easy
call
that
has
a

where
two
thousand
children
dance
under
the

the
music

i
shall
tell
you
about
hereafter
the
joy
of
it
to
have
that
story
to
tell
and
all
about
are
others
like
it
with
more
coming
every
year
to
the
indignant
amazement
of
my
captor
the
janitor
his
school
has
been
thrown
open
to
the
children
in
the
summer
vacation
and
in
the
winter
they
put
a
boys
club
in
to
worry
him
what
further
indignities
there
are
in
store
for
him
in
this
day
of
frills
there
is
no
telling
the
superintendent
of
schools
told
me
only
yesterday
that
he
was
going
to
boston
to
look
into
new
sources
of
worriment
they
have
invented
there
the
world
does
move
in
spite
of
janitors
in
two
short
years
our
school
authorities
advanced
from
the
cautious
proposition
that
it
was
the
sense
of
the
board
of
superintendents
that
the
schoolhouses
might
well
be
used
in
the
cause
of
education
as
neighborhood
centres
to
the
flat
declaration
that
every
rational
system
of
education
should
make
provisions
for
play
and
to
cut
off
all
chance
of
relapse
into
the
old
doubt
whether
such
things
are
educational
that
laid
so
many
of
our
hopes
on
the
dusty
shelf
of
the
circumlocution
office
the
state
legislature
has
expressly
declared
that
the
commonwealth
will
take
the
chance
which
boards
of
education
shunned
of
a
little
amusement
creeping
in
the
schools
may
be
used
for
purposes
of
recreation
to
the
janitor
it
must
seem
that
the
end
of
all
things
is
at
hand
so
the
schools
and
their
playgrounds
were
thrown
open
to
the
children
during
the
long
vacation
with
kindergarten
teachers
to
amuse
them
and
vacation
schools
tempted
the
little
ones
from
the
street
into
the
cool
shade
of
the
classrooms
they
wrought
in
wood
and
iron
they
sang
and
they
played
and
studied
nature
out
of
a
barrel
to
be
sure
that
came
twice
a
week
from
long
island
filled
with
specimens
but
later
on
we
took
a
hint
from
chicago
and
let
the
children
gather
their
own
specimens
on
excursions
around
the
bay
and
suburbs
of
the
city
that
was
a
tremendous
success
and
there
is
better
still
coming
as
i
shall
show
presently
it
sometimes
seems
to
me
as
if
we
were
here
face
to
face
with
the
very
thing
we
are
seeking
and
know
not
how
to
find
the
mere
hint
that
money
might
be
lacking
to
pay
for
the
excursions
set
the
andrew
brotherhood
men
on
long
island
to
devising
schemes
for
inviting
the
school
children
out
on
trolley
and
shore
trips
what
if
they
all
the
christian
endeavor
the
epworth
league
and
the
other
expressions
of
the
same
human
desire
to
find
the
lost
brother
who
are
looking
about
for
something
to
try
their
young
strength
and
enthusiasm
on
what
if
they
were
to
hitch
on
here
and
help
pull
the
load
that
may
get
mired
else
they
need
men
and
women
in
that
work
mere
paid
teaching
will
never
do
it
if
they
can
only
get
them
i
think
we
may
be
standing
upon
the
threshold
of
something
which
shall
bring
us
nearer
to
a
universal
brotherhood
than
all
the
consecration
and
all
the
badges
yet
devised
i
am
thinking
of
the
children
and
of
the
chance
to
take
them
at
once
out
of
the
slum
and
into
our
hearts
while
making
of
the
public
school
the
door
to
a
house
of
citizenship
in
which
we
shall
all
dwell
together
in
full
understanding
without
that
door
the
house
will
never
be
what
we
planned
and
there
is
the
key
all
in
the
children
illustration
the
new
idea
a
stairway
of
public
school
no
the
mere
contact
with
nature
even
out
of
a
barrel
brought
something
to
those
starved
child
lives
that
struck
a
new
note
sometimes
it
rang
with
a
sharp
and
jarring
sound
the
boys
in
the
hester
street
school
could
not
be
made
to
take
an
interest
in
the
lesson
on
wheat
until
the
teacher
came
to
the
effect
of
drought
and
a
bad
year
on
the
farmer
pocket
then
they
understood
they
knew
the
process
strikes
cut
into
the
earnings
of
hester
street
small
enough
at
the
best
of
times
at
frequent
intervals
and
the
boys
need
not
be
told
what
a
bad
year
means
no
other
kind
ever
occurs
there
they
learned
the
lesson
on
wheat
in
no
time
after
that
oftener
it
was
a
gentler
note
that
piped
timidly
in
the
strange
place
a
barrel
of
wild
roses
came
one
day
instead
of
the
expected
specimens
and
these
were
given
to
the
children
they
took
them
greedily
i
wondered
said
the
teacher
if
it
was
more
love
of
the
flower
or
of
getting
something
for
nothing
no
matter
what
but
even
if
it
were
largely
the
latter
there
was
still
the
rose
nothing
like
it
had
come
that
way
before
and
without
a
doubt
it
taught
its
own
lesson
the
italian
child
might
have
jumped
for
it
more
eagerly
but
its
beauty
was
not
wasted
in
either
the
baby
kissed
it
and
it
lay
upon
more
than
one
wan
cheek
and
whispered
who
knows
what
thought
of
hope
and
courage

a

deliverance
has
come
half
the
machine
teaching
the
wooden
output
of
our
public
schools
in
the
past
i
believe
was
due
to
the
practical
isolation
of
the
teachers
between
the
tyranny
of
politics
and
the
distrust
of
those
who
had
good
cause
to
fear
the
politician
and
his
work
there
was
never
a
more
saddening
sight
than
that
of
the
teachers
standing
together
in
an
almost
solid
body
to
resist
reform
of
the
school
system
as
an
attack
upon
them
there
was
no
pretence
on
their
part
that
the
schools
did
not
need
reform
they
knew
better
they
fought
for
their
places
throughout
the
fight
no
word
came
from
them
of
the
children
rights
they
imagined
that
theirs
were
in
danger
and
they
had
no
thought
for
anything
else
we
gathered
then
the
ripe
fruit
of
politics
and
it
will
be
a
long
while
i
suppose
before
we
get
the
taste
out
of
our
mouths
but
the
grip
of
politics
on
our
schools
has
been
loosened

not
shaken
off
altogether

with
a

will
break
the
last
of
her
bonds
and
do
more
for
the
schools

for
us

any
one

can
think

until

has
worked
as
energetically
with

as
it
fought
to
break
down

and
secure

opened

for

by
hanging
schoolrooms
with
beautiful
casts

and
forged
at
the

time
new
and
strong
links
in
the
chain
that
bound
the
boy
all
too
feebly
to
the
school
at
a
time
when
the
demand
of
the
boys
of
the
east
side
for
club
room
which
was
in
itself
one
of
the
healthiest
signs
of
the
day
had
reached
an
exceedingly
dangerous
pass

public

association
broke
ground

will

most

from

to
bridge
it
by
inviting
the
boy
in
under
its
roof
occasionally
the
girl
went
along
a
typical
instance
of
how
the
scheme
worked
was
brought
to
my
attention
at
the
time
by
the
head
worker
of
the
college
settlement
the
back
room
of
the
saloon
was
given
to
the
club
free
of
charge
with
the
understanding
that
the
boy
members
should
treat
as
a
means
of
raising
the
needed
funds
the
club
hit
upon
the
plan
of
fining
members
ten
cents
when
they
got
funny
to
defeat
this
device
of
the
devil
some
way
must
be
found
but
club
room
was
scarce
among
the
tenements
the
good
government
clubs
proposed
to
the
board
of
education
that
it
open
the
empty
classrooms
at
night
for
the
children
use
it
was
my
privilege
to
plead
their
cause
before
the
school
board
and
to
obtain
from
it
the
necessary
permission
after
some
hesitation
and
doubt
as
to
whether
it
was
educational
the
public
education
association
assumed
the
responsibility
for
the
property
and
the
hester
street
school
was
opened
the
property
was
not
molested
only
one
window
was
broken
that
winter
by
a
stray
ball
and
that
was
promptly
paid
for
by
those
who
broke
it
but
the
boys
who
met
there
under
miss
winifred
buck
management
learned
many
a
lesson
of
and
practical
wisdom
that
proved
educational
in
the
highest
degree
her
plan
is
simplicity
itself
through
their
play
the
meeting
usually
begins
with
a
romp
in
quarters
where
there
is
not
too
much
the
boys
learn
the
first
lesson
of
respecting
one
another
rights
the
subsequent
business
meeting
puts
them
upon
the
fundamentals
of
civilized
society
as
it
were
out
of
the
debate
of
the
question
do
we
want
boys
who
swear
steal
gamble
and
smoke
cigarettes
grow
convictions
as
to
why
these
vices
are
wrong
that
put
the
gang
in
its
proper
light
punishment
comes
to
appear
when
administered
by
the
boys
themselves
a
natural
consequence
of
in
defence
of
society
and
the
boy
is
won
he
can
thenceforward
be
trusted
to
work
out
his
own
salvation
if
he
does
it
occasionally
with
excessive
unction
remember
how
recent
was
his
conversion
that
wisdom
is
better
than
wealth
was
rejected
as
a
topic
for
discussion
by
one
of
the
clubs

everybody
knows

which
shall
i
hope
hear
a
good
deal
more
hereafter

is
all
in
its
infancy

this
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
municipality
to
get
the
boys
off
the
street
and
out
of
the
reach
of
the
saloon
a
number
of
schools
were
thrown
open
where
the
crowds
were
greatest
for
evening
play
and
for
clubs
and
sometimes
they
laid
hold
of
the
youngster

sometimes

again

i

would

place

the
idea
during

administration

they
hitched
the
names
to

turned
out

no

to

why
not
on

roof

flying
kites
up
there
the
boys
run
across
and
interfere
with
the
neighbor
pigeons
which
is
apt
to
make
him
wroth
so
you
see
it
is
all
in
the
interests
of
domestic
tranquillity
and
the
common
defence
they
are
not
meaningless
phrases
those
big
words
they
are
the
boy
ideas
of
of
a
real
democracy
struggling
through

our
sight
and
suppose
he
does
walk
on
rhetorical
stilts
he
has
precedent
and
will
show
it
to
you
a
nation
learned
to
walk
on
them
who
shall
say
they
are
not
good
enough
for
him
but
to
return
to
what
i
was
speaking
about

the

even
turned
the
tables
on

nearly
five

has
kept
school
in

examined

the
gallows
used
to
stand
that
cut
short
many
a
career
such
as
they
pursued
they
were
soberly
attentive
to
their
studies
which
were
of
a
severely
practical
turn
their
teacher
david
willard
who
was
a
resident
of
the
university
settlement
in
its
old
delancey
street
home
has
his
own
sound
view
of
how
to
head
off
the
hangman
daily
and
nightly
he
gathers
about
him
in
the
house
on
chrystie
street
where
he
makes
his
home
half
the
boys
and
girls
of
the
neighborhood
whom
he
meets
as
their
friend
on
equal
terms
willard
though
a
young
man
is
one
of
the
most
unique
personages
in
the
city
he
is
now
one
of
the
probation
officers
under
the
new
law
which
seeks
to
save
the
young
offender
rather
than
to
wreak
vengeance
upon
him
and
his
influence
for
good
is
great
the
house
in
chrystie
street
is
known
far
and
wide
as
the
children
house
they
have
their
clubs
there
and
their
games
of
which
willard
is
the
heart
and
soul
i
never
saw
anything
remarkable
in
him
said
one
of
his
old
college
professors
to
me
if
anything
he
was
rather
a
dull
student
it
seems
then
that
even
colleges
are
not
always
institutions
for
discovering
aptitude
it
was
reserved
for
chrystie
street
in
case
once
a
week
another
teacher
comes
to
the
tombs
school
and
tells
the
boys
of
our
city
history
its
famous
buildings
and
great
men
trying
so
to
arouse
their
interest
as
a
first
step
toward
a
citizen
pride
this
one
also
is
sent
by
a
club
of
women
the
city
history
club
which
in
five
years
has
done
strange
things
among
the
children
it
sprang
from
the
proposition
of
robert
abbe
that
the
man
and
the
citizen
has
his
birth
in
the
boy
and
that
to
love
a
thing
one
must
know
it
first
the
classes
that
were
started
for
the
study
of
our
city
history
have
swelled
into
many
scores
of
times
that
number
with
a
small
army
of
pupils
the
pregnant
fact
was
noted
early
by
the
teachers
that
the
immigrant
boy
easily
outstrips
in
interest
for
his
adopted
home
the
native
who
perchance
turns
up
his
nose
at
him
and
later
very
likely
complains
of
the
unscrupulousness
of
the
jew
who
forged
ahead
of
him
in
business
as
well
the
classes
meet
in
settlement
school
or
church
to
hear
about
the
deeds
of
the
fathers
and
when
they
have
listened
and
read
go
with
their
teachers
and
see
for
themselves
the
church
where
washington
worshipped
the
graves
where
the
great
dead
lie
the
fields
where
they
fought
and
bled
and
when
the
little
italian
asks
with
shining
eyes
which
side
were
we
on
who
can
doubt
that
the
lesson
has
sunk
into
a
heart
that
will
thenceforward
beat
more
loyally
for
the
city
of
his
home
we
have
not
any
too
much
pride
in
our
city
the
best
of
us
and
that
is
why
we
let
it
be
run

though

was
organized
there
the
appeal
of

has
not
availed
to
save
it

the

great

when
just
four

the
particular
phase
of
it
that
had
seemed
to
promise
most
was
officially
stamped
as
nonsense
the

of
the
big
schoolhouses

were
to
be

had

go
there

let
them
be
given
up

a

whom
i
argued

indulgently

some

were

sincerely
held

hours
i
remember
that
the
question
was
asked
who
would
keep

the
answer
the
police
will
be
glad
to
i
recalled
without

had
to
establish
patrol

on

whom
the

from

had
carefully
removed
the

aching
for
and
substituted
four

around

they
were
educational
cards
with
pictures

it
required
only
half
a

tell

would

playing
in
the
park
on
sunday
years
ago
came
to
the
rescue
when
it
had
played
its
last
piece
to
end
and
there
burst
forth
as
with
one
voice
from
the
mighty
throng
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
some
doubts
were
set
at
rest
for
all
time
they
were
never
sensible
but
after
that
they
were
silly
so
the
janitor
was
bidden
bring
out
his
key
electric
lights
were
strung
we
will
save
the
money
somewhere
else
said
mayor
low
the
experiment
was
made
with
five
schools
all
on
the
crowded
east
side
i
was
at
dinner
with
friends
at
the
university
settlement
directly
across
from
which
on
the
other
corner
is
one
of
the
great
new
schools
no
i
think
we
had
got
to
the
salad
when
through
the
open
window
there
came
a
yell
of
exultation
and
triumph
that
made
me
fairly
jump
in
my
chair
below
in
the
street
a
mighty
mob
of
children
and
mothers
had
been
for
half
an
hour
besieging
the
door
of
the
schoolhouse
the
yell
signalized
the
opening
of
it
by
the
policeman
in
charge
up
the
stairs
surged
the
multitude
we
could
see
them
racing
climbing
toiling
according
to
their
years
for
the
goal
above
where
the
band
was
tuning
up
one
little
fellow
with
a
trousers
leg
and
a
half
and
a
pair
of
suspenders
and
an
undershirt
as
his
only
other
garments
labored
up
the
long
flight
carrying
his
baby
brother
on
his
back
i
watched
them
go
clear
up
catching
glimpses
of
them
at
every
turn
and
then
i
went
up
after
i
found
them
in
a
corner
propped
against
the
wall
a
look
of
the
serenest
bliss
on
their
faces
as
they
drank
it
all
in
it
was
show
at
last
the
band
was
playing
alabama
and
fifteen
hundred
boys
and
girls
were
dancing
hopping
prancing
to
the
tune
circling
about
and
about
while
they
sang
and
kept
time
to
the
music
when
the
chorus
was
reached
every
voice
was
raised
to
its
shrillest
pitch
way
down
yonder
in
the
cornfield
and
for
once
in
my
life
the
suggestion
of
the
fields
and
the
woods
did
not
seem
hopelessly
out
of
place
in
the
tenth
ward
crowds
baby
in
its
tired
mother
lap
looked
on
out
of
the
sweep
of
the
human
current
the
band
ceased
playing
and
the
boys
took
up
some
game
dodging
hither
and
thither
in
pursuit
of
a
ball
how
they
did
it
will
ever
be
a
mystery
to
me
there
did
not
seem
to
be
room
for
another
child
but
they
managed
as
if
they
had
it
all
to
themselves
there
was
no
disorder
no
one
was
hurt
or
even
knocked
down
unless
in
the
game
and
that
the
game
so
it
was
as
it
should
be
right
in
the
middle
of
it
the
strains
of
sunday
afternoon
all
east
side
children
favorite
burst
forth
and
out
of
the
seeming
confusion
came
rhythmic
order
as
the
whole
body
of
children
moved
singing
along
the
floor
down
below
the
deserted
street
deserted
for
once
in
the
day
had
grown
strangely
still
the
policeman
nodded
contentedly
good
business
indeed
this
was
a
kind
of
roof
patrol
he
could
appreciate
nothing
to
do
less
for
for
here
they
were
not
planning
raids
on
the
grocer
stock
they
were
happy
and
when
children
are
happy
they
are
safe
and
so
are
the
rest
of
us
it
is
the
policeman
philosophy
and
it
is
worth
taking
serious
note
of
a
warning
blast
on
a
trumpet
and
the
banner
floated
out
over
the
the
children
ceased
dancing
every
boy
cap
came
off
and
the
chorus
swelled
loud
and
clear
in
triumph
shall
wave
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
brave
the
light
shone
upon
the
thousand
upturned
faces
scarce
one
in
a
hundred
of
them
all
that
did
not
bear
silent
witness
to
persecution
which
had
driven
a
whole
people
over
the
sea
without
home
without
flag
and
now
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
said
it
i
am
getting
old
and
silly
illustration
the
fellows
and
papa
and
mamma
shall
be
invited
in
yet
it
was
so
at
the
still
bigger
school
at
hester
and
orchard
streets
at
the
biggest
of
them
all
and
the
finest
the
same
no
where
the
janitor
assistant
shooed
the
children
away
with
his
club
the
once
dismal
yard
had
been
festooned
with
electric
lamps
that
turned
night
into
day
and
about
the
danced
nearly
three
thousand
boys
and
girls
to
the
strains
of
money
musk
glad
to
be
alive
and
there
a
forsooth
and
it
is
going
to
be
better
still
for
once
the
ice
has
been
broken
there
are
new
kinks
coming
in
this
dancing
programme
that
is
the
dear
dissipation
of
the
east
side
what
is
to
hinder
the
girls
when
the
long
winter
days
come
from
inviting
in
the
fellows
and
papa
and
mamma
for
a
real
dance
that
shall
take
the
wind
out
of
the
sails
of
the
nothing
in
all
the
world
nor
even
will
there
be
anything
to
stop
superintendent
maxwell
from
taking
a
turn
himself
as
he
said
he
would
or
me
either
if
i
have
danced
in
thirty
years
i
just
dare
him
to
try
the
man
in
charge
of
the
at
no
i
shall
flatly
refuse
to
call
it
a
yard
said
that
he
did
believe
in
any
other
rule
than
order
and
nearly
took
my
breath
away
for
just
then
i
had
a
vision
of
the
club
in
the
doorway
but
it
was
only
a
vision
the
club
was
not
there
as
he
said
it
he
mounted
the
and
waved
the
crowd
to
order
with
his
a
young
lady
has
just
lost
her
gold
watch
on
the
floor
he
said
it
is
here
under
your
feet
bring
it
to
me
the
one
who
finds
it
there
was
a
curious
movement
of
the
crowd
as
if
every
unit
in
it
turned
once
about
itself
and
bowed
and
presently
a
shout
of
discovery
went
up
a
little
girl
with
a
poor
shawl
pinned
about
her
throat
came
forward
with
the
watch
the
manager
waved
his
trumpet
at
me
with
a
bright
smile
you
see
it
works
the
entire
crowd
fell
in
behind
him
in
an
ecstatic
expressive
of
its
joy
and
satisfaction
and
so
they
went
around
and
around
on
that
very
corner
just
across
the
way
a
dozen
years
ago
i
gave
a
stockbroker
a
good
blowing
up
for
hammering
his
cellar
door
full
of
envious
nails
to
prevent
the
children
using
it
as
a
slide
it
was
all
the
playground
they
had
illustration
the
slide
that
was
the
children
only
playground
once
on
the
way
home
i
stopped
at
the
first
of
all
the
public
schools
to
acquire
a
roof
playground
to
see
how
they
did
it
there
the
janitor
had
been
vanquished
but
the
pedagogue
was
in
charge
and
he
had
organized
the
life
out
of
it
all
the
children
sat
around
listless
and
made
little
or
no
attempt
to
dance
a
harassed
teacher
was
vainly
trying
to
form
the
girls
into
ranks
for
exercises
of
some
kind
they
held
up
their
hands
in
desperate
endeavor
to
get
her
ear
only
to
have
them
struck
down
impatiently
or
to
be
summarily
put
out
if
they
tried
again
they
did
not
want
to
exercise
they
wanted
to
play
i
tried
to
voice
their
grievance
to
the
doctor
who
presided
not
at
all
he
said
decisively
there
must
be
system
system
tommyrot
said
my
chicago
friend
at
my
elbow
and
i
felt
like
saying
thank
you
i
do
know
but
i
did
they
have
good
sense
in
chicago
jane
addams
is
there
the
doctor
resumed
his
efforts
to
teach
the
boys
something
having
explained
to
me
that
downstairs
where
they
are
when
it
rains
there
were
seven
distinct
echoes
to
bother
the
band
two
girls
spieled
in
the
corner
a
kind
of
dancing
that
is
not
favored
in
the
playground
there
had
been
none
of
that
at
the
other
places
the
policeman
eyed
the
show
with
a
frown
so
there
was
a
fly
in
our
ointment
after
all
but
for
all
that
the
janitor
is
downed
his
day
dead
this
of
all
things
at
last
has
been
settled
right
and
the
path
cleared
for
the
children
feet
not
in
new
york
only
but
everywhere
and
for
all
time
i
too
am
glad
to
be
alive
in
the
time
that
saw
it
done
chapter
xv
neighbor
the
password
truly
we
live
in
a
wonderful
time
here
have
i
been
trying
to
bring
up
to
date
this
account
of
the
battle
with
the
slum
and
in
the
doing
of
it
have
been
compelled
not
once
but
half
a
dozen
times
to
go
back
and
wipe
out
what
i
had
written
because
it
no
longer
applied
the
ink
was
not
dry
on
the
page
that
pleaded
for
the
helpless
ones
who
have
to
leave
the
hospital
before
they
are
fit
to
take
up
their
battle
with
the
world
so
as
to
make
room
for
others
in
instant
need
one
of
the
saddest
of
sights
that
has
wrung
the
heart
of
the
philanthropist
these
many
years
when
i
read
in
my
paper
of
the
four
million
dollar
gift
to
build
a
convalescents
home
at
once
i
would
rather
be
in
that
man
shoes
than
be
the
czar
of
all
the
russias
i
would
rather
be
blessed
by
the
grateful
heart
of
man
or
woman
who
but
just
now
was
without
hope
than
have

the
diamonds

and
here
upon
my
table
lies
a
letter
from
the
of
the
university
settlement
which
the
postman
brought
half
an
hour
ago
that
lets
more
daylight
in
it
seems
to
me
than
all
the
rest
he
has
been
thinking
he
writes
of
how
to
yoke
the
public
school
and
the
social
settlement
together
and
the
conviction
that
comes
to
everybody
who
thinks
to
solve
problems
has
come
to
him
too
that
the
way
to
do
a
thing
is
to
do
it
so
he
proposes
since
they
need
another
house
over
at
the
west
side
branch
to
acquire
it
by
annexing
the
public
school
and
turning
all
the
force
and
power
that
is
in
the
branch
into
the
bare
walls
of
the
school
there
to
develop
a
social
spirit
and
an
enthusiasm
among
young
and
old
that
shall
make
of
the
school
truly
the
neighborhood
house
and
soul
and
he
asks
us
all
to
fall
in
i
say
it
lets
daylight
in
because
we
have
all
felt
for
some
time
that
something
like
this
was
bound
to
come
only
how
was
not
clear
yet
here
is
this
immense
need
of
a
tenement
house
population
of
more
than
two
million
souls
something
to
take
the
place
as
far
as
anything
can
of
the
home
that
is
there
a
place
to
meet
other
than
the
saloon
a
place
for
the
young
to
do
their
courting
there
is
no
room
for
it
in
the
tenement
and
the
street
is
not
the
place
for
it
yet
it
has
got
to
be
done
a
place
to
make
their
elders
feel
that
they
are
men
and
women
something
else
than
mere
units
why
it
was
this
very
need
that
gave
birth
to
the
social
settlement
among
us
and
we
see
now
that
with
the
old
machinery
it
does
not
supply
it
and
never
can
i
can
reach
the
people
of
just
about
two
blocks
about
me
here
said
this
same
head
worker
of
the
same
settlement
to
me
an
evening
or
two
ago
and
that
is
all
but
there
are
hundreds
of
blocks
filled
with
hungry
minds
and
souls
a
hundred
settlements
would
be
needed
where
there
is
one
the
churches
could
not
meet
the
need
they
ought
to
and
some
day
they
will
when
we
build
the
church
and
the
mission
but
now
they
ca
there
are
not
enough
of
them
for
one
thing
they
do
try
for
only
the
other
day
when
i
went
to
tell
the
methodist
ministers
of
it
and
of
how
they
ought
to
back
up
the
effort
to
have
the
public
school
thrown
open
on
sundays
for
concerts
lectures
and
the
like
after
the
first
shock
of
surprise
they
pulled
themselves
together
manfully
and
said
that
they
would
do
it
they
saw
with
me
that
it
is
a
question
not
of
damaging
the
lord
day
but
of
wresting
it
from
the
devil
who
has
had
it
all
this
while
over
there
on
the
east
side
and
on
the
west
side
too
all
along
the
swarming
streets
with
no
church
in
sight
but
a
saloon
on
every
corner
stand
the
big
schoolhouses
with
their
spacious
halls
empty
and
silent
and
grim
waiting
to
have
the
soul
breathed
into
them
that
alone
can
make
their
teaching
effective
for
good
citizenship
they
belong
to
the
people
why
should
they
not
be
used
by
the
people
sunday
and
and
day
and
night
for
whatever
will
serve
their
ends
if
the
janitor
has
a
fit
now
here
come
the
social
settlements
with
their
plan
of
doing
it
what
claim
have
they
to
stand
in
the
gap
this
one
that
they
are
there
now
though
they
do
not
fill
it
the
gap
has
been
too
much
for
them
they
need
the
help
of
those
they
came
to
succor
quite
as
much
as
need
them
i
have
no
desire
to
find
fault
with
any
one
who
wants
to
help
his
neighbor
god
forbid
i
am
not
even
a
settlement
worker
but
when
i
read
as
i
did
yesterday
a
summing
up
of
the
meaning
of
settlements
by
three
or
four
residents
in
such
houses
and
see
education
reform
politics
local
improvements
legislation
characterized
as
the
aim
and
objects
of
settlement
work
i
am
afraid
somebody
is
on
the
wrong
track
those
things
are
good
provided
they
spring
naturally
from
the
intellectual
life
that
moves
in
and
about
the
settlement
house
indeed
unless
they
do
something
has
quite
decidedly
miscarried
there
but
they
are
not
the
object
when
i
pick
up
a
report
of
one
settlement
and
another
and
find
them
filled
with
little
essays
on
the
people
and
their
ways
and
manners
as
if
the
settlement
were
same
kind
of
a
laboratory
where
they
prepare
human
specimens
for
inspection
and
classification
stick
them
on
pins
like
bugs
and
hold
them
up
and
twirl
them
so
as
to
let
us
have
a
good
look
then
i
know
that
somebody
has
wandered
away
off
and
that
knows
he
for
all
he
is
making
a
brave
show
trying
to
persuade
himself
and
us
that
it
was
worth
the
money
no
use
going
into
that
farther
the
fact
is
that
we
have
all
been
groping
we
saw
the
need
and
started
to
fill
it
and
in
the
strange
surroundings
we
lost
our
bearings
and
the
password
we
got
to
be
sociological
instead
of
neighborly
it
is
not
the
same
thing
illustration
a
cooking
lesson
in
vacation
school
the
best
temperance
sermon
here
is
the
lost
password
neighbor
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
if
a
settlement
is
the
neighbor
of
those
it
would
reach
it
is
nothing
at
all
a
place
said
the
of
toynbee
hall
in
the
discussion
i
spoke
of
and
set
it
on
even
keel
in
an
instant
a
place
of
good
will
rather
than
of
good
works
that
is
it
we
had
become
strangers
had
drifted
apart
and
the
settlement
came
to
introduce
us
to
one
another
again
as
it
were
to
remind
us
that
we
were
neighbors
and
because
that
was
the
one
thing
above
all
that
was
wanted
it
became
an
instant
success
where
it
was
not
converted
into
a
social
experiment
station
and
even
that
could
not
kill
it
if
any
one
doubts
that
i
have
the
right
password
let
him
look
for
the
proof
in
the
organization
this
past
month
of
a
new
co√∂perative
social
settlement
to
be
carried
on
in
conjunction
and
association
with
the
people
in
the
neighborhood
not
a
new
idea
at
all
only
a
fresh
grip
taken
on
the
old
one
it
is
sound
enough
and
strong
enough
to
set
itself
right
if
we
will
only
let
it
only
last
week
elliot
of
the
hudson
guild
over
in
west
street
told
me
of
his
boys
and
their
fathers
subscribing
their
savings
with
the
hope
of
owning
the
guild
house
themselves
they
had
never
let
go
their
grip
on
the
idea
over
there
they
are
of
felix
adler
flock
but
take
now
the
elements
as
we
have
them
this
great
and
terrible
longing
for
neighborliness
where
the
home
feeling
is
gone
with
the
home
the
five
hundred
school
buildings
in
the
metropolis
that
have
already
successfully
been
put
to
neighborhood
use
it
was
nothing
else
that
leipziger
did
when
he
began
his
evening
lectures
in
the
schools
to
grown
audiences
a
dozen
years
ago
and
proudly
pointed
to
a
record
of
thousand
in
attendance
for
the
season
last
winter
nearly
a
million
workingmen
and
their
wives
attended
over
three
thousand
lectures
leipziger
is
now
the
strong
advocate
of
opening
the
schools
on
the
sabbath
as
a
kind
of
sunday
opening
we
can
all
join
in
of
course
he
is
he
has
seen
what
it
means
these
factors
the
need
the
means
and
then
the
settlement
that
is
there
to
put
the
two
together
as
its
own
great
opportunity
has
it
not
a
good
claim
footnote
the
first
year
record
was
lectures
and
hearers
last
winter
there
were
lectures
in
over
places
and
the
total
attendance
was
this
winter
there
will
be
centres
it
is
satisfactory
to
know
that
churches
and
church
houses
fall
in
with
the
plan
more
and
more
where
there
are
no
schools
to
serve
as
halls
experimenting
with
the
school
well
what
of
it
can
stand
it
what
else
have
we
been
doing
the
last
years
or
more
and
what
splendid
results
have
we
not
to
show
for
it
it
is
the
spirit
that
calls
every
innovation
frills
and
boasts
that
we
have
got
the
finest
schools
in
the
world
which
blocks
the
way
to
progress
it
cropped
out
at
a
meeting
of
settlement
workers
and
schoolmen
that
had
for
its
purpose
a
better
understanding
in
the
meeting
one
teacher
arose
and
said
that
the
schools
as
they
are
were
good
enough
for
his
father
and
therefore
they
were
good
enough
for
him
that
teacher
place
is
on
the
shelf
that
has
been
provided
now
for
those
who
have
done
good
work
in
a
day
that
is
past
vaudeville

the
last
tammany
mayor
when
the
east
side
asked
for
a
playground
for
the
children
vaudeville
for
the
masses
killed
rome
the
masses
responded
by
killing
him
politically
my
father
was
a
teacher
and
it
is
because
he
was
a
good
one
and
taught
me
that
when
growth
ceases
decay
begins
that
i
am
never
going
to
be
satisfied
no
matter
how
good
the
schools
get
to
be
i
want
them
ever
closer
to
the
people
life
because
upon
that
does
that
very
life
depend
turn
back
to
what
i
said
about
the
slum
tenant
and
see
what
it
means
in
the
slum
only
per
cent
of
native
parentage
all
but
five
in
a
hundred
had
either
come
over
the
sea
or
else
their
parents
had
nearly
half
were
ignorant
illiterate
for
the
whole
city
the
percentage
of
illiteracy
was
only
turn
to
the
reformatory
showing
of
ten
thousand
and
odd
prisoners
utterly
illiterate
or
able
to
read
and
write
only
with
difficulty
do
you
see
how
the
whole
battle
with
the
slum
is
fought
out
in
and
around
the
public
school
for
in
ignorance
selfishness
finds
its
opportunity
and
the
two
together
make
the
slum
the
mere
teaching
is
only
a
part
of
it
the
school
itself
is
a
bigger
the
meeting
there
of
rich
and
poor
out
of
the
public

comes
must
come
if
we
are
to
last
the
real
democracy
that
has
our
hope
in
keeping
i
wish
it
were
in
my
power
to
compel
every
father
to
send
his
boy
to
the
public
school
i
would
do
it
and
so
perchance
bring
the
school
up
to
the
top
notch
where
it
was
lacking
the
president
of
the
united
states
sets
a
splendid
example
to
us
all
in
letting
his
boys
mingle
with
those
who
are
to
be
their
by
and
by
it
is
precisely
in
the
sundering
of
our
society
into
classes
that
have
little
in
common
are
no
longer
that
our
peril
lives
a
people
can
not
work
together
for
the
good
of
the
state
if
they
are
not
on
speaking
terms
in
the
gap
the
slum
grows
up
that
was
one
reason
why
i
hailed
with
a
shout
the
proposition
of
schwab
the
steel
trust
millionnaire
to
take
a
regiment
of
boys
down
to
staten
island
on
an
excursion
every
day
in
summer
let
me
see
i
have
told
about
that
i
think
he
had
bought
a
large
property
down
there
all
beach
and
lake
and
field
and
woodland
and
proposed
to
build
a
steamer
with
room
for
a
thousand
or
two
and
then
take
them
down
with
a
band
of
music
on
board
and
give
them
a
swim
a
romp
and
a
jolly
good
time
as
soon
as
he
spoke
to
me
about
it
i
said
yes
and
hitch
it
to
the
public
school
somehow
make
it
part
of
the
curriculum
no
more
nature
study
out
of
a
barrel
take
the
whole
school
teachers
and
all
and
let
them
do
their
own
gathering
of
specimens
so
the
children
shall
be
under
efficient
control
and
so
the
tired
teacher
shall
get
a
chance
too
but
more
than
all
so
it
may
befall
that
the
boys
themselves
shall
come
to
know
one
another
better
and
that
more
of
them
shall
get
together
for
what
boy
does
not
want
a
jolly
good
romp
and
why
should
he
not
be
guest
for
the
day
if
he
does
count
his
dollars
by
millions
the
working
plan
the
board
of
education
can
be
trusted
to
provide
i
think
it
will
do
it
gladly
once
it
understands
indeed
why
should
it
not
no
one
thinks
of
surrendering
the
schools
but
simply
of
enlisting
the
young
enthusiasm
that
is
looking
for
employment
and
of
a
way
of
turning
it
to
use
while
the
board
is
constantly
calling
for
just
that
priceless
personal
element
which
money
can
not
buy
and
without
which
the
schools
will
never
reach
their
highest
development
precedents
there
are
in

not
we
can

we

a

in
our

system
as
its
projectors
have
hoped
just
now
it
can
not
be
done
because
it
takes
about
a
year
for
a
book
to
pass
the
ten

twelve
different
kinds
of
censorship
our

zeal
has
erected
about
the

we
shall
have
the
assembly

thrown
open
not
only
for
lectures
and
sunday
concerts
already
one
permit
has
been
granted
for
the
latter
but
for
meetings
and
for
political
meetings
if
i
have
my
way
until
we
consider
our
politics
quite
good
enough
to
be
made
welcome
in
the
school
they
wo
be
good
enough
for
it
the
day
we
do
let
them
in
the
saloon
will
lose
its
grip
and
not
much
before
when
the
fathers
and
mothers
meet
under
the
school
roof
as
in
their
neighborhood
house
and
the
children
have
their
games
their
clubs
and
their
dances
there
when
the
school
in
short
takes
the
place
in
the
life
of
the
people
in
the
crowded
quarters
which
the
saloon
now
monopolizes
there
will
no
longer
be
a
saloon
question
in
politics
and
that
day
the
slum
is
beaten

such
a
very
likely
i
shall
not
find
many
to
agree
with
me
on
this
question
of
political
meetings
let
them
be
then
so
we
shall
more
readily
find
our
way
out
of
the
delusion
that
national
politics
have
any
place
in
municipal
elections
or
affairs
a
notion
that
has
delayed
the
day
of
decency
too
long
we
shall
grow
along
with
the
schools
and
by
and
by
our
party
politics
will
be
clean
enough
to
sit
in
the
school
seats
too
and
oh
by
the
way
as
to
those
seats
is
there
any
special
virtue
in
the
of
straight
rows
that
have
come
down
to
us
from
the
time
of
the
egyptians
or
farther
back
still
no
i
would
not
lay
impious
hand
on
any
hallowed
tradition
educational
or
otherwise
but
is
it
that
and
why
is
it
it
would
be
so
much
easier
to
make
the
school
the
people
hall
and
the
boys
club
if
those
seats
could
be
moved
around
in
human
fashion
they
might
come
naturally
into
human
shape
in
the
doing
of
it
but
as
i
said
i
would
for
the
world
not
for
the
world
only
why
is
the
hallowed
i
am
willing
to
leave
it
to
the
board
we
are
singularly
fortunate
in
having
just
now
a
mayor
who
will
listen
a
board
of
education
that
will
act
and
a
superintendent
of
school
buildings
who
can
and
will
build
schools
to
meet
neighborhood
needs
if
we
will
make
them
plain
the
last
time
i
dropped
into
his
office
i
found
him
busy
between
tiffs
with
contractors
sketching
an
underground
story
for
the
schoolhouse
like
the
great
hall
of
the
cooper
institute
that
should
at
the
same
time
serve
the
purpose
of
an

if
the

is
not
the
best
kind
of
place
for
them
the
experience
of
the

will
show
us
what
kind
is
they
carry
on
no
end
of
such
clubs

let
the

trustily
leave
the

body
was
not

school

may
be

since
its

awoke
now
in
closing
this
account
i
am
reminded
of
the
story
of
an
old
irishman
who
died
here
a
couple
of
years
ago
patrick
mullen
was
an
honest
blacksmith
he
made
guns
for
a
living
he
made
them
so
well
that
one
with
his
name
on
it
was
worth
a
good
deal
more
than
the
market
price
of
guns
other
makers
went
to
him
with
offers
of
money
for
the
use
of
his
stamp
but
they
never
went
twice
when
sometimes
a
gun
of
very
superior
make
was
brought
to
him
to
finish
he
would
stamp
it
mullen
never
patrick
mullen
only
to
that
which
he
himself
had
wrought
did
he
give
his
honest
name
without
reserve
when
he
died
judges
and
bishops
and
other
great
men
crowded
to
his
modest
home
by
the
east
river
and
wrote
letters
to
the
newspapers
telling
how
proud
they
had
been
to
call
him
friend
yet
he
was
and
remained
to
the
end
plain
patrick
mullen

and
in
his
life
he
supplied
the
answer
to
the
sigh
of
dreamers
in
all
days
when
will
the
millennium
come
it
will
come
when
every
man
is
a
patrick

at
his

merely
a
mullen
but
a
patrick
mullen
the
millennium
of
municipal
politics
when
there
shall
be
no
slum
to
fight
will
come
when
every
citizen
does
his
whole
duty
as
a
citizen
not
before
as
long
as
he
despises
politics
and
deputizes
another
to
do
it

him
whether
that
other
wears
the

is
one
thing

can
not

farmed
out
safely

the

because
we
have

within
the

us
all
an
illustration
of
its
truth
in

were
the
patrick

of
the

administration
which
tammany
replaced
with
her
insolent
platform

with
reform
it
was
not
an
ideal
administration
but
it
can
be
said
of
it
at
least
that
it
was
up
to
the
times
it
served
it
made
compromises
with

and
they
were
wretched
failures
it
took
waring

on
which
they
insisted
of
divorcing
politics
from
the
public
business
and
they
let
in
more
light
than
even
my
small
parks
over
on
the
east
side
for
they
showed
us
where
we
stood
and
what
was
the
matter
with
us
we
believed
in
waring
when
he
demonstrated
the
success
of
his
plan
for
cleaning
the
streets
not
before
when
roosevelt
announced
his
programme
of
enforcing
the
excise
law
because
it
law
a
howl
arose
that
would
have
frightened
a
less
resolute
man
from
his
purpose
but
he
went
right
on
doing
the
duty
he
was
sworn
to
do
and
when
at
the
end
of
three
months
of
clamor
and
abuse
we
saw
the
spectacle
of
the
saloon
keepers
formally
resolving
to
help
the
police
instead
of
hindering
them
of
the
prison
ward
in
bellevue
hospital
standing
empty
for
three
days
at
a
time
an
astonishing
and
unprecedented
thing
which
the
warden
could
only
attribute
to
the
prompt
closing
of
the
saloon
at
one
and
of
the
police
force
recovering
its
lost
we
had
found
out
more
and
greater
things
than
whether
the
excise
law
was
a
good
or
a
bad
law
we
understood
what
roosevelt
meant
when
he
insisted
upon
the
primary
virtues
of
honesty
and
courage
in
the
conduct
of
public
business
for
the
want
of
them
in
us
half
the
laws
that
touched
our
daily
lives
had
became
dead
letters
or
vehicles
of
blackmail
and
oppression
it
was
worth
something
to
have
that
lesson
taught
us
in
that
way
to
find
out
that
simple
straightforward
honest
dealing
as
between
man
and
man
is
after
all
effective
in
politics
as
in
perhaps
we
have
not
mastered
the
lesson
yet
but
we
have
not
discharged
the
teacher
either
courage
indeed
there
were
times
during
that
stormy
spell
when
it
seemed
as
if
we
had
grown
wholly
and
hopelessly
flabby
as
a
people
all
the
outcry
against
the
programme
of
order
did
not
come
from
the
lawless
and
the
disorderly
by
any
means
ordinarily
decent
conservative
citizens
joined
in
counselling
moderation
and
virtual
compromise
with
the
lawbreakers
it
was
nothing
else
to
avoid
trouble
the
old
love
of
fair
play
had
been
whittled
down
by
the
of
expediency
to
an
an√¶mic
desire
to
hold
the
scales
even
which
is
a
favorite
modern
device
of
the
devil
for
paralyzing
action
in
men
you
can
not
hold
the
scales
even
in
a
moral
issue
it
inevitably
results
in
the
triumph
of
evil
which
asks
nothing
better
than
the
even
chance
to
which
it
is
not
entitled
when
the
trouble
in
the
police
board
had
reached
a
point
where
it
seemed
impossible
not
to
understand
that
roosevelt
and
his
side
were
fighting
a
cold
and
treacherous
conspiracy
against
the
cause
of
good
government
we
had
the
spectacle
of
a
christian
endeavor
society
inviting
the
man
who
had
hatched
the
plot
the
bitter
and
relentless
enemy
whom
the
mayor
had
summoned
to
resign
and
afterward
did
his
best
to
remove
as
a
fatal
obstacle
to
reform
inviting
this
man
to
come
before
it
and
speak
of
christian
citizenship
it
was
a
sight
to
make
the
bosses
hug
themselves
with
glee
for
christian
citizenship
is
their
nightmare
and
nothing
is
so
cheering
to
them
as
evidence
that
those
who
profess
it
have
no
sense
apart
from
the
moral
bearings
of
it
what
this
question
of
enforcement
of
law
means
in
the
life
of
the
poor
was
illustrated
by
testimony
given
before
the
police
board
under
oath
a
captain
was
on
trial
for
allowing
the
policy
swindle
to
go
unchecked
in
his
precinct
policy
is
a
kind
of
penny
lottery
with
alleged
daily
drawings
which
never
take
place
the
whole
thing
is
a
pestilent
fraud
which
is
allowed
to
exist
only
because
it
pays
heavy
blackmail
to
the
police
and
the
politicians
expert
witnesses
testified
that
eight
policy
shops
in
the
ward
which
they
had
visited
did
a
business
averaging
about
dollars
a
day
each
the
is
a
poor
irish
tenement
ward
the
policy
sharks
were
getting
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
or
more
a
day
of
the
wages
of
those
poor
people
in
sums
of
from
one
and
two
cents
to
a
quarter
without
making
any
return
for
it
the
thing
would
seem
incredible
were
it
not
too
sadly
familiar
the
saloon
keeper
got
his
share
of
what
was
left
and
rewarded
his
customer
by
posing
as
the
friend
of
the
poor
man
whenever
his
business
was
under
scrutiny
i
have
yet
in
my
office
the
record
of
a
single
week
during
the
hottest
of
the
fight
between
roosevelt
and
the
saloons
as
showing
of
what
kind
that
friendship
is
it
embraces
the
destruction
of
eight
homes
by
the
demon
of
drunkenness
the
suicide
of
four
wives
the
murder
of
two
others
by
drunken
husbands
the
killing
of
a
policeman
in
the
street
and
the
torture
of
an
aged
woman
by
her
rascal
son
who
used
to
be
a
good
boy
till
he
took
to
liquor
when
he
became
a
perfect
devil
in
that
r√¥le
he
finally
beat
her
to
death
for
giving
shelter
to
some
evicted
who
else
would
have
had
to
sleep
in
the
street
nice
friendly
turn
was
it
and
yet
there
was
something
to
be
said
for
the
saloon
keeper
he
gave
the
man
the
refuge
from
his
tenement
which
he
needed
i
say
needed
purposely
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
talk
in
our
day
about
the
saloon
as
a
social
necessity
about
all
there
is
to
that
is
that
the
saloon
is
there
and
the
necessity
too
man
is
a
social
animal
whether
he
lives
in
a
tenement
or
in
a
palace
but
the
palace
has
resources
the
tenement
has
not
it
is
a
good
place
to
get
away
from
at
all
times
the
saloon
is
cheery
and
bright
and
never
far
away
the
man
craving
human
companionship
finds
it
there
he
finds
too
in
the
saloon
keeper
one
who
understands
his
wants
much
better
than
the
reformer
who
talks
civil
service
in
the
meetings
civil
service
to
him
and
his
kind
means
yet
a
contrivance
for
keeping
them
out
of
a
job
the
saloon
keeper
knows
the
boss
if
he
is
not
himself
the
boss
or
his
lieutenant
and
can
steer
him
to
the
man
who
will
spend
all
day
at
the
city
hall
if
need
be
to
get
a
job
for
a
friend
and
all
night
pulling
wires
to
keep
him
in
it
if
trouble
is
brewing
beecher
used
to
say
when
pleading
for
bright
hymn
tunes
that
he
did
want
the
devil
to
have
the
monopoly
of
all
the
good
music
in
the
world
the
saloon
has
had
the
monopoly
up
to
date
of
all
the
cheer
in
the
tenements
if
its
owner
has
made
it
pan
out
to
his
own
advantage
and
the
boss
we
at
least
have
no
just
cause
of
complaint
we
let
him
have
the
field
all
to
himself
it
is
good
to
know
that
the
day
is
coming
when
he
will
have
a
rival
model
saloons
may
never
be
more
than
a
dream
in
new
york
but
even
now
the
first
of
a
number
of
social
halls
is
being
planned
by
miss
lillian
wald
of
the
nurses
settlement
and
her
that
shall
give
the
east
side
the
chance
to
eat
and
dance
and
make
merry
without
the
stigma
of
the
bar
upon
it
all
the
first
of
the
buildings
will
be
opened
within
a
year
as
to
this
boss
of
whom
we
hear
so
much
what
manner
of
man
is
he
that
depends
on
how
you
look
at
him
i
have
one
in
mind
a
district
boss
whom
you
would
accept
instantly
as
a
type
if
i
were
to
mention
his
name
which
i
shall
not
do
for
a
reason
which
i
fear
will
shock
you
he
and
i
are
friends
in
his
private
capacity
i
have
real
regard
for
him
as
a
politician
and
a
boss
i
have
none
at
all
i
am
aware
that
this
is
taking
low
ground
in
a
discussion
of
this
kind
but
perhaps
the
reader
will
better
understand
the
relations
of
his
district
to
him
if
i
let
him
into
mine
there
is
no
political
bond
between
us
of
either
district
or
party
just
the
reverse
it
is
purely
personal
he
was
once
a
police
justice
at
that
time
he
kept
a
saloon
and
i
have
known
few
with
more
common
sense
which
happens
to
be
the
one
quality
especially
needed
in
that
office
up
to
the
point
where
politics
came
in
i
could
depend
upon
him
entirely
at
that
point
he
let
me
know
bluntly
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
running
his
district
to
suit
himself
the
way
he
did
it
brought
him
under
the
just
accusation
of
being
guilty
of
every
kind
of
rascality
known
to
politics
when
next
our
paths
would
cross
each
other
it
would
very
likely
be
on
some
errand
of
mercy
to
which
his
feet
were
always
swift
i
recall
the
distress
of
a
dear
and
gentle
lady
at
whose
table
i
once
took
his
part
she
could
not
believe
that
there
was
any
good
in
him
what
he
did
must
be
done
for
effect
some
time
after
that
she
wrote
asking
me
to
look
after
an
east
side
family
that
was
in
great
trouble
it
was
during
the
severe
cold
spell
of
the
winter
of
and
there
was
need
of
haste
i
went
over
at
once
but
although
i
had
lost
no
time
i
found
my
friend
the
boss
ahead
of
me
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
me
to
be
able
to
report
to
my
correspondent
that
he
had
seen
to
their
comfort
and
to
add
that
it
was
unpolitical
charity
altogether
the
family
was
that
of
a
jewish
widow
with
a
lot
of
little
children
he
is
a
roman
catholic
there
was
not
even
a
potential
vote
in
the
house
the
children
being
all
girls
they
were
not
in
his
district
to
boot
and
as
for
effect
he
was
rather
shamefaced
at
my
catching
him
at
it
i
do
not
believe
that
a
soul
has
ever
heard
of
the
case
from
him
to
this
day
my
friend
is
a
tammany
boss
and
i
shall
not
be
accused
of
partiality
for
him
on
that
account
during
that
same
cold
spell
a
politician
of
the
other
camp
came
into
my
office
and
gave
me
a
hundred
dollars
to
spend
as
i
saw
fit
among
the
poor
his
district
was
miles
and
he
was
most
unwilling
to
disclose
his
identity
stipulating
in
the
end
that
no
one
but
i
should
know
where
the
money
came
from
he
was
not
seeking
notoriety
the
plight
of
the
suffering
had
appealed
to
him
and
he
wanted
to
help
where
he
could
that
was
all
now
i
have
not
the
least
desire
to
glorify
the
boss
in
this
he
is
not
glorious
to
me
he
is
simply
human
often
enough
he
is
a
coarse
and
brutal
fellow
in
his
morals
as
in
his
politics
again
he
may
have
some
very
engaging
personal
traits
that
bind
his
friends
to
him
with
the
closest
of
ties
the
poor
man
sees
the
friend
the
charity
the
power
that
is
able
and
ready
to
help
him
in
need
is
it
any
wonder
that
he
overlooks
the
source
of
this
power
this
plenty
that
he
forgets
the
robbery
in
the
robber
who
is
good
to
the
poor
anyhow
if
anybody
got
robbed
it
was
the
rich
with
the
present
ethical
standards
of
the
slum
it
is
easy
to
construct
a
scheme
of
social
justice
out
of
it
that
is
very
comforting
all
round
even
to
the
boss
himself
though
he
is
in
need
of
no
sympathy
or
excuse
politics
he
will
tell
me
in
his
philosophic
moods
is
a
game
for
profit
the
city
foots
the
bills
patriotism
means
to
him
working
for
the
ticket
that
shall
bring
more
profit
i
regard
he
says
lighting
his
cigar
a
repeater
as
a
shade
off
a
murderer
but
you
are
obliged
to
admit
that
in
my
trade
he
is
a
necessary
evil
i
am
not
obliged
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
but
i
can
understand
his
way
of
looking
at
it
he
simply
has
no
political
conscience
he
has
gratitude
loyalty
to
a
friend
that
is
part
of
his
stock
in
trade
fighting
blood
plenty
of
it
all
the
good
qualities
of
the
savage
nothing
more
and
a
savage
he
is
politically
with
no
soul
above
the
dross
he
would
not
rob
a
neighbor
for
the
world
but
he
will
steal
from
the
city
though
he
does
not
call
it
by
that
name
without
a
tremor
and
count
it
a
good
mark
when
i
tell
him
that
he
waves
his
hand
toward
wall
street
as
representative
of
the
business
community
and
toward
the
office
of
his
neighbor
the
padrone
as
representative
of
the
railroads
and
says
with
a
laugh
do
they
all
do
it
the
boss
believes
in
himself
it
is
one
of
his
strong
points
and
he
has
experience
to
back
him
in
the
fall
of
we
shook
off
boss
rule
in
new
york
and
set
up
housekeeping
for
ourselves
we
kept
it
up
three
years
and
then
went
back
to
the
old
style
i
should
judge
that
we
did
it
because
we
were
tired
of
too
much
virtue
perhaps
we
were
not
built
to
hold
such
a
lot
at
once
besides
it
is
much
easier
to
be
ruled
than
to
rule
that
fall
after
the
election
when
i
was
concerned
about
what
would
become
of
my
small
parks
of
the
health
department
in
which
i
took
such
just
pride
and
of
a
dozen
other
things
i
received
one
unvarying
reply
to
my
anxious
question
or
rather
two
if
it
was
the
health
department
i
was
told
go
to
platt
he
is
the
only
man
who
can
do
it
he
is
a
sensible
man
and
will
see
that
it
is
protected
if
small
parks
it
was
go
to
croker
he
will
not
allow
the
work
to
be
stopped
a
playgrounds
bill
was
to
be
presented
in
the
legislature
and
everybody
advised
go
to
platt
he
wo
object
it
is
popular
and
so
on
my
advisers
were
not
politicians
they
were
business
men
but
recently
honestly
interested
in
reform
i
was
talking
one
day
with
a
gentleman
of
very
wide
reputation
as
a
philanthropist
about
the
unhappy
lot
of
the
old
horses
which
after
lives
of
toil
that
deserve
a
better
fate
are
sold
for
a
song
to
drag
out
a
weary
existence
hauling
some
huckster
cart
around
and
wishing
that
they
might
be
pensioned
off
to
live
out
their
years
on
a
farm
with
enough
to
eat
and
a
chance
to
roll
in
the
grass
he
was
much
interested
and
promptly
gave
me
this
advice
i
tell
you
what
you
do
you
go
and
see
croker
he
likes
horses
no
wonder
the
boss
believes
in
himself
he
would
be
less
than
human
if
he
did
not
and
he
is
very
human
i
had
voted
on
the
day
of
the
greater
new
york
election
the
tammany
election
as
we
learned
to
call
it
afterward
in
my
home
out
in
the
borough
of
queens
and
went
over
to
the
depot
to
catch
the
train
for
the
city
on
the
platform
were
half
a
dozen
of
my
neighbors
all
business
men
all
friends
of
reform
some
of
them
were
just
down
from
breakfast
one
i
remember
as
introducing
a
resolution
in
a
meeting
we
had
held
about
the
discourtesy
of
local
politicians
he
looked
surprised
when
reminded
that
it
was
election
day
why
is
it
he
said
they
did
send
any
carriage
said
another
regretfully
i
do
see
what
the
use
said
the
third
the
roads
are
just
as
bad
as
when
we
began
talking
about
it
we
had
been
trying
to
mend
them
the
fourth
yawned
and
said
i
do
care
i
have
my
business
to
attend
to
and
they
took
the
train
which
meant
that
they
lost
their
votes
the
tammany
captain
was
busy
hauling
his
voters
by
the
to
the
polling
place
over
there
stood
a
reform
candidate
who
had
been
defeated
in
the
primary
and
puffed
out
his
chest
the
politicians
are
afraid
of
me
he
said
they
slapped
him
on
the
back
as
they
went
by
and
told
him
that
he
was
a
devil
of
a
fellow
so
tammany
came
back
and
four
long
years
we
swore
at
it
but
i
am
afraid
we
swore
at
the
wrong
fellow
the
real
tammany
is
not
the
conscienceless
rascal
that
plunders
our
treasury
and
fattens
on
our
substance
that
one
is
a
mere
counterfeit
it
is
the
voter
who
waits
for
a
carriage
to
take
him
to
the
polls
the
man
who
does
see
what
the
use
the
business
man
who
says
business
is
business
and
has
no
time
to
waste
on
voting
the
citizen
who
will
wait
to
see
how
the
cat
jumps
because
he
does
want
to
throw
his
vote
away
the
cowardly
american
who
does
want
to
antagonize
anybody
the
fool
who
washes
his
hands
of
politics
these
are
the
real
tammany
the
men
after
the
boss
own
heart
for
every
one
whose
vote
he
buys
there
are
two
of
these
who
give
him
theirs
for
nothing
we
shall
get
rid
of
him
when
these
withdraw
their
support
when
they
become
citizens
of
the
patrick
mullen
stamp
as
faithful
at
the
polling
place
as
he
was
at
the
forge
not
before
there
is
as
much
work
for
reform
at
the
top
as
at
the
bottom
the
man
in
the
slum
votes
according
to
his
light
and
the
boss
holds
the
candle
but
the
boss
is
in
no
real
sense
a
leader
he
follows
instead
always
as
far
behind
the
moral
sentiment
of
the
community
as
he
thinks
is
safe
he
has
heard
it
said
that
a
community
will
not
be
any
better
than
its
citizens
and
that
it
will
be
just
as
good
as
they
are
and
he
applies
the
saying
to
himself
he
is
no
worse
a
boss
than
the
town
deserves
i
can
conceive
of
his
taking
credit
to
himself
as
some
kind
of
a
moral
instrument
by
which
the
virtue
of
the
community
may
be
graded
though
that
is
most
unlikely
he
does
not
bother
himself
with
the
morals
of
anything
but
right
here
is
his
achilles
heel
the
man
has
no
conscience
he
can
not
tell
the
signs
of
it
in
others
it
always
comes
upon
him
unawares
reform
to
him
simply
means
the
outs
fighting
to
get
in
the
real
thing
he
will
always
underestimate
witness
richard
croker
in
the
last
election
offering
bishop
potter
after
his
crushing
letter
to
the
mayor
to
join
him
in
purifying
the
city
and
when
politely
refused
setting
up
an
inquiry
of
his
own
the
conclusion
is
irresistible
that
he
thought
the
bishop
either
a
fool
or
a
politician
playing
for
points
such
a
man
is
not
the
power
he
seems
he
is
formidable
only
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
shaking
it
takes
to
rouse
the
community
conscience
the
boss
is
like
the
measles
a
distemper
of
a
infancy
when
we
shall
have
come
of
age
politically
he
will
have
no
terrors
for
us
meanwhile
being
charged
with
the
business
of
governing
which
we
left
to
him
because
we
were
too
busy
making
money
he
follows
the
track
laid
out
for
him
and
makes
the
business
pan
out
all
that
is
in
it
he
fights
when
we
want
to
discharge
him
of
course
he
does
no
man
likes
to
give
up
a
good
job
he
will
fight
or
bargain
as
he
sees
his
way
clear
he
will
give
us
small
parks
play
piers
new
schools
anything
we
ask
to
keep
his
place
while
trying
to
find
out
the
price
of
this
conscience
which
he
does
not
understand
even
to
the
half
of
his
kingdom
he
will
give
to
be
in
on
the
new
deal
he
has
done
it
before
and
there
is
no
reason
that
he
can
see
why
it
should
not
be
done
again
and
he
will
appeal
to
the
people
whom
he
is
plundering
to
trust
him
because
they
know
him
odd
as
it
sounds
this
is
where
he
has
his
real
hold
i
have
shown
why
this
is
so
to
the
poor
people
of
his
district
the
boss
is
a
friend
in
need
he
is
one
of
them
he
does
not
want
to
reform
them
far
from
it
no
doubt
it
is
very
ungrateful
of
them
but
the
poor
people
have
no
desire
to
be
reformed
they
do
not
think
they
need
to
be
they
consider
their
moral
standards
quite
as
high
as
those
of
the
rich
and
resent
being
told
that
they
are
mistaken
the
reformer
comes
to
them
from
another
world
to
tell
them
these
things
and
goes
his
way
the
boss
lives
among
them
he
helped
john
to
a
job
on
the
pipes
in
their
hard
winter
and
got
mike
on
the
force
they
know
him
as
a
good
neighbor
and
trust
him
to
their
harm
he
drags
their
standard
ever
farther
down
the
question
for
those
who
are
trying
to
help
them
is
how
to
make
them
transfer
their
allegiance
and
trust
their
real
friends
instead
it
ought
not
be
a
difficult
question
to
answer
any
teacher
could
do
it
he
knows
if
he
knows
anything
that
the
way
to
get
and
keep
the
children
confidence
is
to
trust
them
and
let
them
know
that
they
are
trusted
they
will
almost
always
come
up
to
the
demand
thus
made
upon
them
preaching
to
them
does
little
good
preaching
at
them
still
less
men
whether
rich
or
poor
are
much
like
children
the
good
in
them
is
just
as
good
and
the
bad
in
view
of
their
enlarged
opportunities
for
mischief
not
so
much
worse
all
considered
a
vigorous
optimism
a
stout
belief
in
one
is
better
equipment
in
a
campaign
for
civic
virtue
than
stacks
of
tracts
and
arguments
economic
and
moral
there
is
good
bottom
even
in
the
slum
for
that
kind
of
an
anchor
to
get
a
grip
on
some
years
ago
i
went
to
see
a
boxing
match
there
had
been
much
talk
about
the
hall
was
jammed
with
a
rough
and
noisy
crowd
hotly
intent
upon
its
favorite
his
opponent
who
hailed
i
think
from
somewhere
in
delaware
was
greeted
with
hostile
demonstrations
as
a
foreigner
but
as
the
battle
wore
on
and
he
was
seen
to
be
fair
and
manly
while
the
new
yorker
struck
one
foul
blow
after
another
the
attitude
of
the
crowd
changed
rapidly
from
enthusiastic
approval
of
the
favorite
to
scorn
and
contempt
and
in
the
last
round
when
he
knocked
the
delawarean
over
with
a
foul
blow
the
audience
rose
in
a
body
and
yelled
to
have
the
fight
given
to
the
foreigner
until
my
blood
tingled
with
pride
for
the
decision
would
leave
it
practically
without
a
cent
it
had
staked
all
it
had
on
the
new
yorker
he
is
a
good
man
i
heard
on
all
sides
while
the
once
favorite
sneaked
away
without
a
friend
good
meant
fair
and
manly
to
that
crowd
i
thought
as
i
went
to
the
office
the
next
morning
that
it
ought
to
be
easy
to
appeal
to
such
a
people
with
measures
that
were
fair
and
just
if
we
could
only
get
on
common
ground
but
the
only
hint
i
got
from
my
reform
paper
was
an
editorial
denunciation
of
the
brutality
of
boxing
on
the
same
page
that
had
an
enthusiastic
review
of
the
college
football
season
i
do
not
suppose
it
did
any
harm
for
the
paper
was
probably
not
read
by
one
of
the
men
it
had
set
out
to
reform
but
suppose
it
had
been
how
much
would
it
have
appealed
to
them
exactly
the
qualities
of
robust
manliness
which
football
is
supposed
to
encourage
in
college
students
had
been
evoked
by
the
trial
of
strength
and
skill
which
they
had
witnessed
as
to
the
brutality
they
knew
that
fifty
young
men
are
maimed
or
killed
at
football
to
one
who
fares
ill
in
a
boxing
match
would
it
seem
to
them
common
sense
or
cant
and
humbug
that
is
what
it
comes
down
to
in
the
end
common
sense
and
common
honesty
common
sense
to
steer
us
clear
of
the
sociology
reef
that
would
make
our
cause
ridiculous
on
fifth
avenue
and
in
east
broadway
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
man
who
would
do
things
by
system
and
in
order
but
the
man
who
would
reduce
men
and
women
and
children
to
mere
items
in
his
infallible
system
and
classify
and
them
until
they
are
as
dried
up
as
his
theories
that
man
i
will
fight
till
i
die
one
throb
of
a
human
heart
is
worth
a
whole
book
of
his
stuff
common
honesty
to
keep
us
afloat
at
all
if
we
worship
as
success
mere
closing
our
eyes
to
the
means
let
us
at
least
say
it
like
the
man
who
told
me
that
after
all
one
has
to
admire
bill
devery
he
got
the
dough
devery
was
tammany
police
chief
the
man
is
entitled
to
his
opinion
but
if
it
gets
hitched
to
the
reform
cart
by
mistake
the
load
is
going
to
be
spilled
it
has
been
more
than
once
a
saving
sense
of
humor
might
have
avoided
some
of
those
pitfalls
i
am
seriously
of
the
opinion
that
a
professional
humorist
ought
to
be
attached
to
every
reform
movement
to
keep
it
from
making
itself
ridiculous
by
either
too
great
solemnity
or
too
much
conceit
as
it
is
the
enemy
sometimes
employs
him
with
effect
failing
the
adoption
of
that
plan
i
would
recommend
a
decree
of
banishment
against
photographers
men
and
the
rest
of
the
congratulatory
staff
why
should
the
fact
that
a
citizen
has
done
a
citizen
duty
deserve
to
be
celebrated
in
print
and
picture
as
if
something
extraordinary
had
happened
the
smoke
of
battle
had
not
cleared
away
after
the
victory
of
reform
in
the
fall
of
before
the
committee
and
all
the
little
rushed
to
the
photographer
to
get
themselves
on
record
as
the
men
who
did
it
the
spectacle
might
have
inspired
in
the
humorist
the
advice
to
get
two
sets
made
while
they
were
about
it
one
to
serve
by
and
by
as
an
exhibit
of
the
men
who
did
and
as
the
event
proved
he
would
have
been
right
but
it
is
easy
to
find
fault
and
on
that
tack
we
get
no
farther
those
men
did
a
great
work
and
they
did
it
well
they
built
from
the
bottom
and
they
built
the
foundation
broad
and
strong
good
schools
better
homes
and
a
chance
for
the
boy
are
good
bricks
to
build
with
in
such
a
structure
as
we
are
rearing
they
last
just
now
we
are
laying
another
course
more
than
one
i
hope
but
even
if
it
were
different
we
need
not
despair
let
the
enemy
come
back
once
more
it
will
not
be
to
stay
it
may
be
that
like
moses
and
his
followers
we
of
the
present
day
shall
see
the
promised
land
only
from
afar
and
with
the
eye
of
faith
because
of
our
sins
that
to
a
younger
and
sturdier
it
shall
be
given
to
blaze
the
path
of
civic
righteousness
that
was
our
dream
i
like
to
think
that
it
is
so
and
that
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
coming
of
men
like
roosevelt
and
waring
at
this
time
with
their
simple
appeal
to
the
reason
of
honest
men
unless
i
greatly
err
in
reading
the
signs
of
the
times
it
is
indeed
so
and
the
day
of
the
boss
and
of
the
slum
is
drawing
to
an
end
our
faith
has
felt
the
new
impulse
rather
i
should
say
it
has
given
it
the
social
movements
and
that
which
we
call
politics
are
but
a
reflection
of
what
the
people
honestly
believe
a
chart
of
their
aims
and
aspirations
charity
in
our
day
no
longer
means
alms
but
justice
the
social
settlements
are
substituting
vital
touch
for
the
machine
charity
that
reaped
a
crop
of
hate
and
beggary
charity
organization
conscience
born
of
love
some
one
has
well
called
it
is
substituting
its
methods
in
high
and
low
places
for
the
senseless
old
ways
its
champions
are
oftener
found
standing
with
organized
labor
for
legislation
to
correct
the
people
wrongs
and
when
the
two
stand
together
nothing
can
resist
them
through
its
teaching
we
are
learning
that
our
responsibility
as
citizens
for
a
law
does
not
cease
with
its
enactment
but
rather
begins
there
we
are
growing
in
other
words
to
the
stature
of
real
citizenship
we
are
emerging
from
the
kind
of
barbarism
that
dragged
children
to
the
jail
and
thrust
them
in
among
hardened
criminals
there
and
that
sat
by
helpless
and
saw
the
foundlings
die
in
the
infant
hospital
at
the
rate
really
there
was
no
rate
they
practically
all
died
every
one
that
was
not
immediately
removed
to
a
home
and
a
mother
for
four
years
now
a
joint
committee
of
the
state
charities
aid
association
and
the
association
for
improving
the
condition
of
the
poor
has
taken
them
off
the
city
hands
and
adopted
them
out
and
in
every
hundred
now
live
and
grow
up
after
all
not
even
a
jersey
cow
can
take
the
place
of
a
mother
with
a
baby
and
we
are
building
a
children
court
that
shall
put
an
end
to
the
other
outrage
for
boys
taken
there
are
let
off
on
probation
to
give
them
the
chance
under
a
different
teaching
from
the
slum
which
it
denied
them
till
now
illustration
in
the
king
garden
the
playground
at
the
jacob
riis
house
we
have
learned
that
we
can
not
pass
off
checks
for
human
sympathy
in
settlement
of
our
brotherhood
arrears
the
church
which
once
stood
by
indifferent
or
uncomprehending
is
hastening
to
enter
the
life
of
the
people
i
have
told
of
how
in
the
memory
of
men
yet
living
one
church
moving
away
from
the
crowd
left
its
old
mulberry
street
home
to
be
converted
into
tenements
that
justly
earned
the
name
of
dens
of
death
in
the
health
department
records
while
another
became
the
foulest
lodging
house
in
an
unclean
city
and
of
how
it
was
a
church
corporation
that
owned
the
worst
underground
dive
in
those
bad
old
days
and
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
all
remonstrances
the
church
was
angling
for
souls
but
souls
in
this
world
live
in
bodies
endowed
with
reason
the
results
of
that
kind
of
fishing
were
empty
pews
and
cold
hearts
and
the
cry
that
went
up
what
shall
we
do
to
lay
hold
of
this
great
multitude
that
has
slipped
from
us
the
years
have
passed
and
brought
the
answer
we
see
churches
of
every
denomination
uniting
in
a
systematic
canvass
of
the
city
to
get
at
the
facts
of
the
people
life
of
which
they
had
ceased
to
be
a
part
pleading
for
parks
playgrounds
kindergartens
libraries
clubs
and
better
homes
there
is
a
new
and
hearty
sound
to
the
word
brother
that
is
full
of
hope
the
cry
has
been
answered
the
gap
in
the
social
body
between
rich
and
poor
is
no
longer
widening
we
are
certainly
coming
closer
together
a
dozen
years
ago
when
the
king
daughters
lighted
a
christmas
tree
in
gotham
court
the
children
ran
screaming
from
santa
claus
as
from
a
bogey
man
here
lately
the
boys
in
the
hebrew
institute
schools
nearly
broke
the
bank
laying
in
supplies
to
do
him
honor
i
do
not
mean
that
the
jews
are
deserting
to
join
the
christian
church
they
are
doing
that
which
is
better
they
are
embracing
its
spirit
and
they
and
we
are
the
better
for
it
the
more
i
know
of
the
other
half
writes
a
friend
to
me
the
more
i
feel
the
great
gulf
that
is
fixed
between
us
and
the
more
profoundly
i
grieve
that
this
is
the
best
that
christian
civilization
has
as
yet
been
able
to
do
toward
a
true
social
system
let
my
friend
take
heart
she
herself
has
been
busy
in
my
sight
all
these
years
binding
up
the
wounds
if
that
be
the
most
a
christian
civilization
has
been
able
to
do
for
the
neighbor
till
now
who
shall
say
that
it
is
not
also
the
greatest
this
do
and
thou
shalt
live
said
the
lord
of
him
who
showed
mercy
that
was
the
mark
of
the
brotherhood
no
the
gulf
is
not
widening
it
is
only
that
we
have
taken
soundings
and
know
it
and
in
the
doing
of
it
we
have
come
to
know
one
another
the
rest
we
may
confidently
leave
with
him
who
knows
it
all
god
knows
we
waited
long
enough
and
how
close
we
were
to
one
another
all
the
while
without
knowing
it
two
or
three
years
ago
at
christmas
a
clergyman
who
lives
out
of
town
and
has
a
houseful
of
children
asked
me
if
i
could
not
find
for
them
a
poor
family
in
the
city
with
children
of
about
the
same
ages
whom
they
might
visit
and
befriend
he
worked
every
day
in
the
office
of
a
foreign
mission
in
fifth
avenue
and
knew
little
of
the
life
that
moved
about
him
in
the
city
i
picked
out
a
hungarian
widow
in
an
east
side
tenement
whose
brave
struggle
to
keep
her
little
flock
together
had
enlisted
my
sympathy
and
strong
admiration
she
was
a
cleaner
in
an
office
building
not
until
all
the
arrangements
had
been
made
did
it
occur
to
me
to
ask
where
then
it
turned
out
that
she
was
scrubbing
floors
in
the
missionary
house
right
at
my
friend
door
they
had
passed
one
another
every
day
each
in
need
of
the
other
and
each
as
far
from
the
other
as
if
oceans
separated
them
instead
of
a
doorstep
four
inches
wide
looking
back
over
the
years
that
lie
behind
with
their
work
and
forward
to
those
that
are
coming
i
see
only
cause
for
hope
as
i
write
these
last
lines
in
a
land
in
the
city
of
my
birth
the
children
are
playing
under
my
window
and
calling
to
one
another
with
glad
cries
in
my
sweet
even
as
we
did
in
the
long
ago
life
and
the
world
are
before
them
bright
with
the
promise
of
morning
so
to
me
seem
the
skies
at
home
not
lightly
do
i
say
it
for
i
have
known
the
toil
of
it
on
the
pioneer
line
that
turns
men
hair
gray
but
i
have
seen
also
the
reward
of
the
toil
new
york
is
the
youngest
of
the
world
great
cities
barely
yet
out
of
knickerbockers
it
may
be
that
our
century
will
yet
see
it
as
the
greatest
of
them
all
the
task
that
is
set
it
the
problem
it
has
to
solve
and
which
it
may
not
shirk
is
the
problem
of
civilization
of
human
progress
of
a
people
fitness
for
that
is
on
trial
among
us
we
shall
solve
it
by
the
formula
of
human
sympathy
of
humane
touch
somewhere
in
these
pages
i
have
told
of
the
woman
in
chicago
who
accounted
herself
the
happiest
woman
alive
because
she
had
at
last
obtained
a
playground
for
her
poor
neighbors
children
i
have
lived
here
for
years
she
said
to
me
and
struggled
with
principalities
and
powers
and
have
made
up
my
mind
that
the
most
and
the
best
i
can
do
is
to
live
right
here
with
my
people
and
smile
with
them
keep
smiling
weep
when
i
must
but
smile
as
long
as
i
possibly
can
and
the
tears
shone
in
her
gentle
old
eyes
as
she
said
it
when
we
have
learned
to
smile
and
weep
with
the
poor
we
shall
have
mastered
our
problem
then
the
slum
will
have
lost
its
grip
and
the
boss
his
job
until
then
while
they
are
in
possession
our
business
is
to
hold
taut
and
take
in
slack
right
along
never
letting
go
for
a
moment
and
now
having
shown
you
the
dark
side
of
the
city
which
after
all
i
love
with
its
great
memories
its
high
courage
and
its
bright
skies
as
i
love
the
little
danish
town
where
my
cradle
stood
let
me
before
i
close
this
account
of
the
struggle
with
evil
show
you
also
its
good
heart
by
telling
you
the
unnecessary
story
of
ben
wah
and
her
parrot
perchance
it
may
help
you
to
grasp
better
the
meaning
of
the
battle
with
the
slum
it
is
for
such
as
she
and
for
such
as
jim
whose
story
i
told
before
that
we
are
fighting
chapter
xvii
the
unnecessary
story
of
ben
wah
and
her
parrot
ben
wah
was
dying
word
came
up
from
the
district
office
of
the
charity
organization
society
to
tell
me
of
it
would
i
come
and
see
her
before
i
went
away
ben
wah
was
an
old
charge
of
mine
the
french
canadian
widow
of
an
iroquois
indian
whom
years
before
i
had
unearthed
in
a
hudson
street
tenement
i
was
just
then
making
ready
for
a
voyage
across
the
ocean
to
the
old
home
to
see
my
own
mother
and
the
thought
of
the
aged
woman
who
laid
away
her
children
long
ago
by
the
cold
of
her
tribe
in
canadian
forests
was
a
call
not
to
be
resisted
i
went
at
once
the
signs
of
illness
were
there
in
a
notice
tacked
up
on
the
wall
warning
everybody
to
keep
away
when
her
attic
should
be
still
until
her
friends
could
come
from
the
charity
office
it
was
a
notion
she
had
mccutcheon
the
district
visitor
explained
that
would
not
let
her
rest
till
her
paper
was
made
out
for
her
born
in
the
wilderness
death
had
no
such
terror
as
prying
eyes
them
police
fellows
she
said
with
the
least
touch
of
resentment
in
her
gentle
voice
they
might
take
my
things
and
sell
them
to
buy
cigars
to
smoke
i
suspect
it
was
the
cigar
that
grated
harshly
it
was
ever
to
her
a
vulgar
slur
on
her
beloved
pipe
in
truth
the
mere
idea
of
ben
wah
smoking
a
cigar
rouses
in
me
impatient
resentment
without
her
pipe
she
was
not
herself
i
see
her
yet
stuffing
it
with
approving
forefinger
on
the
christmas
day
when
i
had
found
her
with
tobacco
pouch
empty
and
pocket
to
boot
and
nodding
the
quaint
comment
from
her
corner
it
no
disgrace
to
be
poor
but
it
sometimes
very
inconvenient
illustration
ben
wah
there
was
something
in
the
little
attic
room
that
spoke
of
the
coming
change
louder
than
the
warning
paper
a
mat
with
its
bundle
of
rags
put
carefully
aside
the
thirsty
on
the
which
reached
appealingly
from
its
toward
the
window
as
if
in
wondering
search
for
the
hands
that
had
tended
it
so
faithfully
bore
silent
testimony
that
ben
wah
was
over
at
last
it
had
been
a
long
day
how
long
no
one
may
ever
know
the
winter
of
the
big
snow
or
the
year
when
deer
was
scarce
on
the
gatineau
is
not
as
good
a
guide
to
in
the
towns
as
in
the
woods
and
ben
wah
knew
no
other
her
thoughts
dwelt
among
the
memories
of
the
past
as
she
sat
slowly
nodding
her
turbaned
head
idle
for
once
the
very
arranged
and
smoothed
with
unusual
care
was
notice
proceeding
from
a
primitive
human
impulse
before
the
great
mystery
she
was
ashamed
and
covered
her
head
the
charity
visitor
told
me
what
i
had
half
guessed
beyond
the
fact
that
she
was
tired
and
had
made
up
her
mind
to
die
nothing
ailed
ben
wah
but
at
her
age
the
doctor
had
said
it
was
enough
she
would
have
her
way
in
faith
she
was
failing
day
by
day
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
make
her
last
days
as
easy
as
might
be
i
talked
to
her
of
my
travels
of
the
great
salt
water
upon
which
i
should
journey
many
days
but
her
thoughts
were
in
the
lonely
woods
and
she
did
not
understand
i
told
her
of
beautiful
france
the
language
of
which
she
spoke
with
a
singularly
sweet
accent
and
asked
her
if
there
was
not
something
i
might
bring
back
to
her
to
make
her
happy
as
i
talked
on
a
reminiscent
smile
came
into
her
eyes
and
lingered
there
it
was
evidently
something
that
pleased
her
by
slow
degrees
we
dragged
the
bashful
confession
out
of
her
that
there
was
yet
one
wish
she
had
in
this
life
once
upon
a
time
long
long
ago
when
as
a
young
woman
she
had
gone
about
peddling
beads
she
had
seen
a
bird
such
a
splendid
bird
big
and
green
and
beautiful
with
a
red
turban
and
that
could
talk
talk
as
she
recalled
the
glorious
apparition
she
became
quite
her
old
self
again
and
reached
for
her
neglected
pipe
with
trembling
hands
if
she
could
ever
see
that
bird
again
but
she
guessed
it
was
long
since
gone
she
was
a
young
woman
then
and
now
she
was
old
so
old
she
settled
back
in
her
chair
and
let
the
pipe
go
out
poor
old
soul
said
mccutcheon
patting
the
wrinkled
hand
in
her
lap
her
lips
framed
the
word
parrot
across
the
room
to
me
and
i
nodded
back
when
we
went
out
together
it
was
settled
between
us
that
ben
wah
was
to
be
doctored
according
to
her
own
prescription
if
it
broke
the
rules
of
every
school
of
medicine
i
went
straight
back
to
the
office
and
wrote
in
my
newspaper
that
ben
wah
was
sick
and
needed
a
parrot
a
green
one
with
a
red
tuft
and
that
she
must
have
it
right
away
i
told
of
her
lonely
life
and
of
how
on
a
christmas
eve
years
ago
i
had
first
met
her
at
the
door
of
the
charity
organization
society
laboring
up
the
stairs
with
a
big
bundle
done
up
in
blue
which
she
left
in
the
office
with
the
message
that
it
was
for
those
who
were
poorer
than
she
they
were
opening
it
when
i
came
in
it
contained
a
lot
of
little
garments
of
blanket
stuff
as
they
used
to
make
them
for
the
pappooses
among
her
people
in
the
far
north
it
was
the
very
next
day
that
i
found
her
in
her
attic
penniless
and
without
even
the
comfort
of
her
pipe
like
the
widow
of
old
she
had
cast
her
mite
into
the
treasury
even
all
she
had
all
this
i
told
in
my
paper
and
how
she
whose
whole
life
had
been
kindness
to
others
was
now
in
need
in
need
of
a
companion
to
share
her
lonely
life
of
something
with
a
voice
which
would
not
come
in
and
go
away
again
and
leave
her
and
i
begged
that
any
one
who
had
a
green
parrot
with
a
red
tuft
would
send
it
in
at
once
new
york
is
a
good
town
to
live
in
it
has
a
heart
it
no
sooner
knew
that
ben
wah
wanted
a
parrot
than
it
hustled
about
to
supply
one
at
once
the
morning
mail
brought
stacks
of
letters
with
offers
of
money
to
buy
a
parrot
they
came
from
lawyers
business
men
and
bank
presidents
men
who
pore
over
dry
ledgers
and
drive
sharp
bargains
on
and
are
never
supposed
to
give
a
thought
to
lonely
widows
pining
away
in
poor
attics
while
they
were
being
sorted
a
poor
little
tramp
flew
in
through
the
open
window
of
the
charities
building
in
great
haste
apparently
in
search
of
mccutcheon
room
its
feathers
were
ruffled
and
its
bangs
awry
as
if
it
had
not
had
time
to
make
its
morning
toilet
it
had
come
in
such
haste
to
see
if
it
would
do
though
it
could
not
talk
it
might
at
least
sing
to
the
sick
old
woman
sing
of
the
silent
forests
with
the
silver
lakes
deep
in
their
bosom
where
the
young
bucks
trailed
the
moose
and
the
panther
and
where
she
listened
at
the
lodge
door
for
their
coming
and
the
song
might
bring
back
the
smile
to
her
wan
lips
but
though
it
was
nearly
green
and
had
tousled
top
it
was
not
a
parrot
and
it
would
not
do
the
young
women
who
write
in
the
big
books
in
the
office
caught
it
and
put
it
in
a
cage
to
sing
to
them
instead
in
the
midst
of
the
commotion
came
the
parrot
itself
big
and
green
in
a
stunning
cage
it
was
an
amiable
bird
despite
its
splendid
and
cocked
its
crimson
head
one
side
to
have
it
scratched
through
the
bars
and
held
up
one
claw
as
if
to
shake
hands
how
to
get
it
to
ben
wah
without
the
shock
killing
her
was
the
problem
that
next
presented
itself
mccutcheon
solved
it
by
doing
the
cage
up
carefully
in
newspaper
and
taking
it
along
herself
all
the
way
down
the
bird
passed
muffled
comments
on
the
metropolitan
railway
service
and
on
its
captivity
to
the
considerable
embarrassment
of
its
keeper
but
they
reached
the
beach
street
tenement
and
ben
attic
at
last
there
mccutcheon
stowed
it
carefully
away
in
a
corner
while
she
busied
herself
about
her
aged
friend
she
was
working
slowly
down
through
an
address
which
she
had
designed
to
break
the
thing
gently
and
by
degrees
when
the
parrot
extending
a
feeler
on
its
own
hook
said
behind
its
paper
screen
ben
wah
sat
up
straight
and
looked
fixedly
at
the
corner
seeing
the
big
bundle
there
she
went
over
and
peered
into
it
she
caught
a
quick
breath
and
stared
where
you
get
that
bird
she
demanded
of
mccutcheon
faintly
oh
that
is
riis
bird
said
that
lady
sparring
for
time
a
friend
gave
it
to
him
where
you
take
him
ben
wah
gasped
her
hand
pressed
against
her
feeble
old
heart
her
friend
saw
and
gave
right
up
i
am
not
going
to
take
it
anywhere
she
said
i
brought
it
for
you
this
is
to
be
its
home
and
you
are
to
be
its
mother
grandma
and
its
friend
you
are
to
be
always
together
from
now
on
always
and
have
a
good
time
with
that
she
tore
the
paper
from
the
cage
the
parrot
after
all
made
the
speech
of
the
occasion
he
considered
the
garret
the
on
the
through
which
the
sunlight
came
in
making
a
cheerful
streak
on
the
floor
ben
wah
and
her
turban
and
his
late
carrier
then
he
climbed
upon
his
stick
turned
a
somersault
and
said
here
we
are
or
words
to
that
effect
thereupon
he
held
his
head
over
to
be
scratched
by
ben
wah
in
token
of
a
compact
of
friendship
then
and
there
made
joy
after
all
does
not
kill
ben
wah
wept
long
and
silently
big
happy
tears
of
gratitude
then
she
wiped
them
away
and
went
about
her
household
cares
as
of
old
the
prescription
had
worked
the
next
day
the
notice
vanished
from
the
wall
of
the
room
where
there
were
now
two
voices
for
one
i
came
back
from
europe
to
find
my
old
friend
with
a
lighter
step
and
a
lighter
heart
than
in
many
a
day
the
parrot
had
learned
to
speak
canadian
french
to
the
extent
of
demanding
his
crackers
and
water
in
the
lingo
of
the
whether
he
will
yet
stretch
his
linguistic
acquirements
to
the
learning
of
iroquois
i
shall
not
say
it
is
at
least
possible
the
two
are
inseparable
the
last
time
i
went
to
see
them
no
one
answered
my
knock
on
the
i
raised
the
curtain
that
serves
for
a
door
and
looked
in
ben
wah
was
asleep
upon
the
bed
perched
upon
her
shoulder
was
the
parrot
no
longer
constrained
by
the
bars
of
a
cage
with
his
head
tucked
snugly
in
her
neck
asleep
too
so
i
left
them
and
so
i
like
to
remember
them
always
comrades
true
it
happened
that
when
i
was
in
chicago
last
spring
i
told
their
story
to
a
friend
a
woman
oh
write
it
she
said
you
must
and
when
i
asked
why
she
replied
with
feminine
logic
because
it
is
so
unnecessary
the
barrel
of
flour
does
stick
out
all
over
it
now
i
have
done
as
she
bade
me
perhaps
she
was
right
women
know
these
things
best
like
my
own
city
they
have
hearts
and
will
understand
the
unnecessary
story
of
ben
wah
and
her
parrot
