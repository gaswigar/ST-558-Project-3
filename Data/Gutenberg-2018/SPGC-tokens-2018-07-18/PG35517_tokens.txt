and
joseph

is
going

the
night
said
the
smooth
man
to
his
companion
an
individual
not
of
the
most
charming
appearance
who
had
chosen
to
make
his
mustache
merge
into
a
pair
of
short
the
two
stood
at
the
hall
door
grinning
evilly
at
each
other
and
presently
a
girl
ran
quickly
down
the
stairs
and
joined
them
she
was
quite
young
with
a
quaint
and
piquant
rather
than
a
beautiful
face
and
her
eyes
were
of
a
shining
hazel
she
held
a
neat
paper
parcel
in
one
hand
and
laughed
with
her
friends
leave
the
door
open
said
the
smooth
man
to
the
other
as
they
were
going
out
yes
by
he
went
on
with
an
ugly
oath
we
leave
the
front
door
on
the
jar
he
may
like
to
see
company
you
know
the
other
man
looked
doubtfully
about
him
is
it
quite
prudent
do
you
think
davies
he
said
pausing
with
his
hand
on
the
mouldering
knocker
i
do
think
lipsius
would
like
it
what
do
you
say
helen
i
agree
with
davies
davies
is
an
artist
and
you
are
commonplace
richmond
and
a
bit
of
a
coward
let
the
door
stand
open
of
course
but
what
a
pity
lipsius
had
to
go
away
he
would
have
enjoyed
himself
yes
replied
the
smooth
davies
that
summons
to
the
west
was
very
hard
on
the
doctor
the
three
passed
out
leaving
the
hall
door
cracked
and
riven
with
frost
and
wet
half
open
and
they
stood
silent
for
a
moment
under
the
ruinous
shelter
of
the
porch
well
said
the
girl
it
is
done
at
last
i
shall
hurry
no
more
on
the
track
of
the
young
man
with
spectacles
we
owe
a
great
deal
to
you
said
davies
politely
the
doctor
said
so
before
he
left
but
have
we
not
all
three
some
farewells
to
make
i
for
my
part
propose
to
say
here
before
this
picturesque
but
mouldy
residence
to
my
friend
burton
dealer
in
the
antique
and
curious
and
the
man
lifted
his
hat
with
an
exaggerated
bow
and
i
said
richmond
bid
adieu
to
wilkins
the
private
secretary
whose
company
has
i
confess
become
a
little
tedious
farewell
to
miss
lally
and
to
miss
leicester
also
said
the
girl
making
as
she
spoke
a
delicious
courtesy
farewell
to
all
occult
adventure
the
farce
is
played
davies
and
the
lady
seemed
full
of
grim
enjoyment
but
richmond
tugged
at
his
whiskers
nervously
i
feel
a
bit
shaken
up
he
said
i
seen
rougher
things
in
the
states
but
that
crying
noise
he
made
gave
me
a
sickish
feeling
and
then
the
smell
but
my
stomach
was
never
very
strong
the
three
friends
moved
away
from
the
door
and
began
to
walk
slowly
up
and
down
what
had
been
a
gravel
path
but
now
lay
green
and
pulpy
with
damp
mosses
it
was
a
fine
autumn
evening
and
a
faint
sunlight
shone
on
the
yellow
walls
of
the
old
deserted
house
and
showed
the
patches
of
gangrenous
decay
and
all
the
stains
the
black
drift
of
rain
from
the
broken
pipes
the
scabrous
blots
where
the
bare
bricks
were
exposed
the
green
weeping
of
a
gaunt
laburnum
that
stood
beside
the
porch
and
ragged
marks
near
the
ground
where
the
reeking
clay
was
gaining
on
the
worn
foundations
it
was
a
queer
rambling
old
place
the
centre
perhaps
two
hundred
years
old
with
dormer
windows
sloping
from
the
tiled
roof
and
on
each
side
there
were
georgian
wings
bow
windows
had
been
carried
up
to
the
first
floor
and
two
cupolas
that
had
once
been
painted
a
bright
green
were
now
gray
and
neutral
broken
urns
lay
upon
the
path
and
a
heavy
mist
seemed
to
rise
from
the
unctuous
clay
the
neglected
shrubberies
grown
all
tangled
and
unshapen
smelt
dank
and
evil
and
there
was
an
atmosphere
all
about
the
deserted
mansion
that
proposed
thoughts
of
an
opened
grave
the
three
friends
looked
dismally
at
the
rough
grasses
and
the
nettles
that
grew
thick
over
lawn
and
and
at
the
sad
in
the
midst
of
the
weeds
there
above
green
and
oily
scum
instead
of
lilies
stood
a
rusting
triton
on
the
rocks
sounding
a
dirge
through
a
shattered
horn
and
beyond
beyond
the
sunk
fence
and
the
far
meadows
the
sun
slid
down
and
shone
red
through
the
bars
of
the
elm
trees
richmond
shivered
and
stamped
his
foot
we
had
better
be
going
soon
he
said
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
here
no
said
davies
it
is
finished
at
last
i
thought
for
some
time
we
should
never
get
hold
of
the
gentleman
with
the
spectacles
he
was
a
clever
fellow
but
lord
he
broke
up
badly
at
last
i
can
tell
you
he
looked
white
at
me
when
i
touched
him
on
the
arm
in
the
bar
but
where
could
he
have
hidden
the
thing
we
can
all
swear
it
was
not
on
him
the
girl
laughed
and
they
turned
away
when
richmond
gave
a
violent
start
ah
he
cried
turning
to
the
girl
what
have
you
got
there
look
davies
look
it
all
oozing
and
dripping
the
young
woman
glanced
down
at
the
little
parcel
she
was
carrying
and
partially
unfolded
the
paper
yes
look
both
of
you
she
said
it
my
own
idea
do
you
think
it
will
do
nicely
for
the
doctor
museum
it
comes
from
the
right
hand
the
hand
that
took
the
gold
tiberius
davies
nodded
with
a
good
deal
of
approbation
and
richmond
lifted
his
ugly
bowler
and
wiped
his
forehead
with
a
dingy
handkerchief
i
going
he
said
you
two
can
stay
if
you
like
the
three
went
round
by
the
stable
path
past
the
withered
wilderness
of
the
old
kitchen
garden
and
struck
off
by
a
hedge
at
the
back
making
for
a
particular
point
in
the
road
about
five
minutes
later
two
gentlemen
whom
idleness
had
led
to
explore
these
forgotten
outskirts
of
london
came
sauntering
up
the
shadowy
carriage
drive
they
had
spied
the
deserted
house
from
the
road
and
as
they
observed
all
the
heavy
desolation
of
the
place
they
began
to
moralize
in
the
great
style
with
considerable
debts
to
jeremy
taylor
look
dyson
said
the
one
as
they
drew
nearer
look
at
those
upper
windows
the
sun
is
setting
and
though
the
panes
are
dusty
yet
the
grimy
sash
an
oriel
burns
phillipps
replied
the
elder
and
it
must
be
said
the
more
pompous
of
the
two
i
yield
to
fantasy
i
can
not
withstand
the
influence
of
the
grotesque
here
where
all
is
falling
into
dimness
and
dissolution
and
we
walk
in
cedarn
gloom
and
the
very
air
of
heaven
goes
mouldering
to
the
lungs
i
can
not
remain
commonplace
i
look
at
that
deep
glow
on
the
panes
and
the
house
lies
all
enchanted
that
very
room
i
tell
you
is
within
all
blood
and
fire
adventure
of
the
gold
tiberius
the
acquaintance
between
dyson
and
charles
phillipps
arose
from
one
of
those
myriad
chances
which
are
every
day
doing
their
work
in
the
streets
of
london
dyson
was
a
man
of
letters
and
an
unhappy
instance
of
talents
misapplied
with
gifts
that
might
have
placed
him
in
the
flower
of
his
youth
among
the
most
favored
of
bentley
favorite
novelists
he
had
chosen
to
be
perverse
he
was
it
is
true
familiar
with
scholastic
logic
but
he
knew
nothing
of
the
logic
of
life
and
he
flattered
himself
with
the
title
of
artist
when
he
was
in
fact
but
an
idle
and
curious
spectator
of
other
men
endeavors
amongst
many
delusions
he
cherished
one
most
fondly
that
he
was
a
strenuous
worker
and
it
was
with
a
gesture
of
supreme
weariness
that
he
would
enter
his
favorite
resort
a
small
tobacco
shop
in
great
queen
street
and
proclaim
to
any
one
who
cared
to
listen
that
he
had
seen
the
rising
and
setting
of
two
successive
suns
the
proprietor
of
the
shop
a
man
of
singular
civility
tolerated
dyson
partly
out
of
good
nature
and
partly
because
he
was
a
regular
customer
he
was
allowed
to
sit
on
an
empty
cask
and
to
express
his
sentiments
on
literary
and
artistic
matters
till
he
was
tired
or
the
time
for
closing
came
and
if
no
fresh
customers
were
attracted
it
is
believed
that
none
were
turned
away
by
his
eloquence
dyson
was
addicted
to
wild
experiments
in
tobacco
he
never
wearied
of
trying
new
combinations
and
one
evening
he
had
just
entered
the
shop
and
given
utterance
to
his
last
preposterous
formula
when
a
young
fellow
of
about
his
own
age
who
had
come
in
a
moment
later
asked
the
shopman
to
duplicate
the
order
on
his
account
smiling
politely
as
he
spoke
to
dyson
address
dyson
felt
profoundly
flattered
and
after
a
few
phrases
the
two
entered
into
conversation
and
in
an
hour
time
the
tobacconist
saw
the
new
friends
sitting
side
by
side
on
a
couple
of
casks
deep
in
talk
my
dear
sir
said
dyson
i
will
give
you
the
task
of
the
literary
man
in
a
phrase
he
has
got
to
do
simply
this
to
invent
a
wonderful
story
and
to
tell
it
in
a
wonderful
manner
i
will
grant
you
that
said
phillipps
but
you
will
allow
me
to
insist
that
in
the
hands
of
the
true
artist
in
words
all
stories
are
marvellous
and
every
circumstance
has
its
peculiar
wonder
the
matter
is
of
little
consequence
the
manner
is
everything
indeed
the
highest
skill
is
shown
in
taking
matter
apparently
commonplace
and
transmuting
it
by
the
high
alchemy
of
style
into
the
pure
gold
of
art
that
is
indeed
a
proof
of
great
skill
but
it
is
great
skill
exerted
foolishly
or
at
least
unadvisedly
it
is
as
if
a
great
violinist
were
to
show
us
what
marvellous
harmonies
he
could
draw
from
a
banjo
no
no
you
are
really
wrong
i
see
you
take
a
radically
mistaken
view
of
life
but
we
must
thresh
this
out
come
to
my
rooms
i
live
not
far
from
here
it
was
thus
that
dyson
became
the
associate
of
charles
phillipps
who
lived
in
a
quiet
square
not
far
from
holborn
thenceforth
they
haunted
each
other
rooms
at
intervals
sometimes
regular
and
occasionally
the
reverse
and
made
appointments
to
meet
at
the
shop
in
queen
street
where
their
talk
robbed
the
tobacconist
profit
of
half
its
charm
there
was
a
constant
jarring
of
literary
formulas
dyson
exalting
the
claims
of
the
pure
imagination
while
phillipps
who
was
a
student
of
physical
science
and
something
of
an
ethnologist
insisted
that
all
literature
ought
to
have
a
scientific
basis
by
the
mistaken
benevolence
of
deceased
relatives
both
young
men
were
placed
out
of
reach
of
hunger
and
so
meditating
high
achievements
idled
their
time
pleasantly
away
and
revelled
in
the
careless
joys
of
a
bohemianism
devoid
of
the
sharp
seasoning
of
adversity
one
night
in
june
phillipps
was
sitting
in
his
room
in
the
calm
retirement
of
red
lion
square
he
had
opened
the
window
and
was
smoking
placidly
while
he
watched
the
movement
of
life
below
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
afterglow
of
sunset
had
lingered
long
about
it
and
the
flushing
twilight
of
a
summer
evening
vying
with
the
in
the
square
had
fashioned
a
chiaroscuro
that
had
in
it
something
unearthly
and
the
children
racing
to
and
fro
upon
the
pavement
the
lounging
idlers
by
the
public
and
the
casual
rather
flickered
and
hovered
in
the
play
of
lights
than
stood
out
substantial
things
by
degrees
in
the
houses
opposite
one
window
after
another
leaped
out
a
square
of
light
now
and
again
a
figure
would
shape
itself
against
a
blind
and
vanish
and
to
all
this
magic
the
runs
and
flourishes
of
brave
italian
opera
played
a
little
distance
off
on
a
seemed
an
appropriate
accompaniment
while
the
bass
of
the
traffic
of
holborn
never
ceased
phillipps
enjoyed
the
scene
and
its
effects
the
light
in
the
sky
faded
and
turned
to
darkness
and
the
square
gradually
grew
silent
and
still
he
sat
dreaming
at
the
window
till
the
sharp
peal
of
the
house
bell
roused
him
and
looking
at
his
watch
he
found
that
it
was
past
ten
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
his
friend
dyson
entered
and
according
to
his
custom
sat
down
in
an
armchair
and
began
to
smoke
in
silence
you
know
phillipps
he
said
at
length
that
i
have
always
battled
for
the
marvellous
i
remember
your
maintaining
in
that
chair
that
one
has
no
business
to
make
use
of
the
wonderful
the
improbable
the
odd
coincidence
in
literature
and
you
took
the
ground
that
it
was
wrong
to
do
so
because
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
wonderful
and
the
improbable
do
happen
and
men
lives
are
not
really
shaped
by
odd
coincidence
now
mind
you
if
that
were
so
i
would
not
grant
your
conclusion
because
i
think
the
theory
is
all
nonsense
but
i
deny
your
premise
a
most
singular
thing
has
happened
to
me
really
dyson
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
of
course
i
oppose
your
argument
whatever
it
may
be
but
if
you
would
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
of
your
adventure
i
should
be
delighted
well
it
came
about
like
this
i
have
had
a
very
hard
day
work
indeed
i
have
scarcely
moved
from
my
old
bureau
since
seven
last
night
i
wanted
to
work
out
that
idea
we
discussed
last
tuesday
you
know
the
notion
of
the
yes
i
remember
have
you
been
able
to
do
anything
with
it
yes
it
came
out
better
than
i
expected
but
there
were
great
difficulties
the
usual
agony
between
the
conception
and
the
execution
anyhow
i
got
it
done
at
about
seven
and
i
thought
i
should
like
a
little
of
the
fresh
air
i
went
out
and
wandered
rather
aimlessly
about
the
streets
my
head
was
full
of
my
tale
and
i
much
notice
where
i
was
going
i
got
into
those
quiet
places
to
the
north
of
oxford
street
as
you
go
west
the
genteel
residential
neighborhood
of
stucco
and
prosperity
i
turned
east
again
without
knowing
it
and
it
was
quite
dark
when
i
passed
along
a
sombre
little
ill
lighted
and
empty
i
did
not
know
at
the
time
in
the
least
where
i
was
but
i
found
out
afterwards
that
it
was
not
very
far
from
tottenham
court
road
i
strolled
idly
along
enjoying
the
stillness
on
one
side
there
seemed
to
be
the
back
premises
of
some
great
shop
tier
after
tier
of
dusty
windows
lifted
up
into
the
night
with
contrivances
for
raising
heavy
goods
and
below
large
doors
fast
closed
and
bolted
all
dark
and
desolate
then
there
came
a
huge
pantechnicon
warehouse
and
over
the
way
a
grim
blank
wall
as
forbidding
as
the
wall
of
a
jail
and
then
the
headquarters
of
some
volunteer
regiment
and
afterwards
a
passage
leading
to
a
court
where
wagons
were
standing
to
be
hired
it
was
one
might
almost
say
a
street
devoid
of
inhabitants
and
scarce
a
window
showed
the
glimmer
of
a
light
i
was
wondering
at
the
strange
peace
and
dimness
there
where
it
must
be
close
to
some
roaring
main
artery
of
london
life
when
suddenly
i
heard
the
noise
of
dashing
feet
tearing
along
the
pavement
at
full
speed
and
from
a
narrow
passage
a
mews
or
something
of
that
kind
a
man
was
discharged
as
from
a
catapult
under
my
very
nose
and
rushed
past
me
flinging
something
from
him
as
he
ran
he
was
gone
and
down
another
street
in
an
instant
almost
before
i
knew
what
had
happened
but
i
did
much
bother
about
him
i
was
watching
something
else
i
told
you
he
had
thrown
something
away
well
i
watched
what
seemed
a
line
of
flame
flash
through
the
air
and
fly
quivering
over
the
pavement
and
in
spite
of
myself
i
could
not
help
tearing
after
it
the
impetus
lessened
and
i
saw
something
like
a
bright
roll
slower
and
slower
and
then
deflect
towards
the
gutter
hover
for
a
moment
on
the
edge
and
dance
down
into
a
drain
i
believe
i
cried
out
in
positive
despair
though
i
had
the
least
notion
what
i
was
hunting
and
then
to
my
joy
i
saw
that
instead
of
dropping
into
the
sewer
it
had
fallen
flat
across
two
bars
i
stooped
down
and
picked
it
up
and
whipped
it
into
my
pocket
and
i
was
just
about
to
walk
on
when
i
heard
again
that
sound
of
dashing
footsteps
i
do
know
why
i
did
it
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
dived
down
into
the
mews
or
whatever
it
was
and
stood
as
much
in
the
shadow
as
possible
a
man
went
by
with
a
rush
a
few
paces
from
where
i
was
standing
and
i
felt
uncommonly
pleased
that
i
was
in
hiding
i
could
make
out
much
feature
but
i
saw
his
eyes
gleaming
and
his
teeth
showing
and
he
had
an
knife
in
one
hand
and
i
thought
things
would
be
very
unpleasant
for
gentleman
number
one
if
the
second
robber
or
robbed
or
what
you
like
caught
him
up
i
can
tell
you
phillipps
a
fox
hunt
is
exciting
enough
when
the
horn
blows
clear
on
a
winter
morning
and
the
hounds
give
tongue
and
the
charge
away
but
it
nothing
to
a
man
hunt
and
that
what
i
had
a
slight
glimpse
of
there
was
murder
in
the
fellow
eyes
as
he
went
by
and
i
do
think
there
was
much
more
than
fifty
seconds
between
the
two
i
only
hope
it
was
enough
dyson
leant
back
in
his
armchair
and
relit
his
pipe
and
puffed
thoughtfully
phillipps
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
musing
over
the
story
of
violent
death
fleeting
in
chase
along
the
pavement
the
knife
shining
in
the
lamplight
the
fury
of
the
pursuer
and
the
terror
of
the
pursued
well
he
said
at
last
and
what
was
it
after
all
that
you
rescued
from
the
gutter
dyson
jumped
up
evidently
quite
startled
i
really
have
a
notion
i
did
think
of
looking
but
we
shall
see
he
fumbled
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
drew
out
a
small
and
shining
object
and
laid
it
on
the
table
it
glowed
there
beneath
the
lamp
with
the
radiant
glory
of
rare
old
gold
and
the
image
and
the
letters
stood
out
in
high
relief
clear
and
sharp
as
if
it
had
but
left
the
mint
a
month
before
the
two
men
bent
over
it
and
phillipps
took
it
up
and
examined
it
closely
imp
tiberius
cæsar
augustus
he
read
the
legend
and
then
looking
at
the
reverse
of
the
coin
he
stared
in
amazement
and
at
last
turned
to
dyson
with
a
look
of
exultation
do
you
know
what
you
have
found
he
said
apparently
a
gold
coin
of
some
antiquity
said
dyson
coolly
quite
so
a
gold
tiberius
no
that
is
wrong
you
have
found
gold
tiberius
look
at
the
reverse
dyson
looked
and
saw
the
coin
was
stamped
with
the
figure
of
a
faun
standing
amidst
reeds
and
flowing
water
the
features
minute
as
they
were
stood
out
in
delicate
outline
it
was
a
face
lovely
and
yet
terrible
and
dyson
thought
of
the
passage
of
the
playmate
gradually
growing
with
his
growth
and
increasing
with
his
stature
till
the
air
was
filled
with
the
rank
fume
of
the
goat
yes
he
said
it
is
a
curious
coin
do
you
know
it
i
know
about
it
it
is
one
of
the
comparatively
few
historical
objects
in
existence
it
is
all
storied
like
those
jewels
we
have
read
of
a
whole
cycle
of
legend
has
gathered
round
the
thing
the
tale
goes
that
it
formed
part
of
an
issue
struck
by
tiberius
to
commemorate
an
infamous
excess
you
see
the
legend
on
the
reverse
it
is
said
that
by
an
extraordinary
accident
the
whole
issue
was
thrown
into
the
melting
pot
and
that
only
this
one
coin
escaped
it
glints
through
history
and
legend
appearing
and
disappearing
with
intervals
of
a
hundred
years
in
time
and
continents
in
place
it
was
discovered
by
an
italian
humanist
and
lost
and
rediscovered
it
has
not
been
heard
of
since
when
sir
joshua
byrde
a
turkey
merchant
brought
it
home
from
aleppo
and
vanished
with
it
a
month
after
he
had
shown
it
to
the
virtuosi
no
man
knew
or
knows
where
and
here
it
is
put
it
into
your
pocket
dyson
he
said
after
a
pause
i
would
not
let
any
one
have
a
glimpse
of
the
thing
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
talk
about
it
did
either
of
the
men
you
saw
see
you
well
i
think
not
i
do
think
the
first
man
the
man
who
was
vomited
out
of
the
dark
passage
saw
anything
at
all
and
i
am
sure
that
the
second
could
not
have
seen
me
and
you
did
really
see
them
you
could
recognize
either
the
one
or
the
other
if
you
met
him
in
the
street
no
i
do
think
i
could
the
street
as
i
said
was
dimly
lighted
and
they
ran
like
the
two
men
sat
silent
for
some
time
each
weaving
his
own
fancies
of
the
story
but
lust
of
the
marvellous
was
slowly
overpowering
more
sober
thoughts
it
is
all
more
strange
than
i
fancied
he
said
at
last
it
was
queer
enough
what
i
saw
a
man
is
sauntering
along
a
quiet
sober
london
street
a
street
of
gray
houses
and
blank
walls
and
there
for
a
moment
a
veil
seems
drawn
aside
and
the
very
fume
of
the
pit
steams
up
through
the
flagstones
the
ground
glows
red
hot
beneath
his
feet
and
he
seems
to
hear
the
hiss
of
the
infernal
caldron
a
man
flying
in
mad
terror
for
his
life
and
furious
hate
pressing
hot
on
his
steps
with
knife
drawn
ready
here
indeed
is
horror
but
what
is
all
that
to
what
you
have
told
me
i
tell
you
phillipps
i
see
the
plot
thicken
our
steps
will
henceforth
be
dogged
with
mystery
and
the
most
ordinary
incidents
will
teem
with
significance
you
may
stand
out
against
it
and
shut
your
eyes
but
they
will
be
forced
open
mark
my
words
you
will
have
to
yield
to
the
inevitable
a
clue
tangled
if
you
like
has
been
placed
by
chance
in
our
hands
it
will
be
our
business
to
follow
it
up
as
for
the
guilty
person
or
persons
in
this
strange
case
they
will
be
unable
to
escape
us
our
nets
will
be
spread
far
and
wide
over
this
great
city
and
suddenly
in
the
streets
and
places
of
public
resort
we
shall
in
some
way
or
other
be
made
aware
that
we
are
in
touch
with
the
unknown
criminal
indeed
i
almost
fancy
i
see
him
slowly
approaching
this
quiet
square
of
yours
he
is
loitering
at
street
corners
wandering
apparently
without
aim
down
thoroughfares
but
all
the
while
coming
nearer
and
nearer
drawn
by
an
irresistible
magnetism
as
ships
were
drawn
to
the
loadstone
rock
in
the
eastern
tale
i
certainly
think
replied
phillipps
that
if
you
pull
out
that
coin
and
flourish
it
under
people
noses
as
you
are
doing
at
the
present
moment
you
will
very
probably
find
yourself
in
touch
with
the
criminal
or
a
criminal
you
will
undoubtedly
be
robbed
with
violence
otherwise
i
see
no
reason
why
either
of
us
should
be
troubled
no
one
saw
you
secure
the
coin
and
no
one
knows
you
have
it
i
for
my
part
shall
sleep
peacefully
and
go
about
my
business
with
a
sense
of
security
and
a
firm
dependence
on
the
natural
order
of
things
the
events
of
the
evening
the
adventure
in
the
street
have
been
odd
i
grant
you
but
i
resolutely
decline
to
have
any
more
to
do
with
the
matter
and
if
necessary
i
shall
consult
the
police
i
will
not
be
enslaved
by
a
gold
tiberius
even
though
it
swims
into
my
ken
in
a
manner
which
is
somewhat
melodramatic
and
i
for
my
part
said
dyson
go
forth
like
a
in
search
of
adventure
not
that
i
shall
need
to
seek
rather
adventure
will
seek
me
i
shall
be
like
a
spider
in
the
midst
of
his
web
responsive
to
every
movement
and
ever
on
the
alert
shortly
afterwards
dyson
took
his
leave
and
phillipps
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
in
examining
some
flint
which
he
had
purchased
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
they
were
the
work
of
a
modern
and
not
a
palæolithic
man
still
he
was
far
from
gratified
when
a
close
scrutiny
showed
him
that
his
suspicions
were
well
founded
in
his
anger
at
the
turpitude
which
would
impose
on
an
ethnologist
he
completely
forgot
dyson
and
the
gold
tiberius
and
when
he
went
to
bed
at
first
sunlight
the
whole
tale
had
faded
utterly
from
his
thoughts
the
encounter
of
the
pavement
dyson
walking
leisurely
along
oxford
street
and
staring
with
bland
inquiry
at
whatever
caught
his
attention
enjoyed
in
all
its
rare
flavors
the
sensation
that
he
was
really
very
hard
at
work
his
observation
of
mankind
the
traffic
and
the
tickled
his
faculties
with
an
exquisite
bouquet
he
looked
serious
as
one
looks
on
whom
charges
of
weight
and
moment
are
laid
and
he
was
attentive
in
his
glances
to
right
and
left
for
fear
lest
he
should
miss
some
circumstance
of
more
acute
significance
he
had
narrowly
escaped
being
run
over
at
a
crossing
by
a
charging
van
for
he
hated
to
hurry
his
steps
and
indeed
the
afternoon
was
warm
and
he
had
just
halted
by
a
place
of
popular
refreshment
when
the
astounding
gestures
of
a
well
dressed
individual
on
the
opposite
pavement
held
him
enchanted
and
gasping
like
a
fish
a
treble
line
of
hansoms
carriages
vans
cabs
and
omnibuses
was
tearing
east
and
west
and
not
the
most
daring
adventurer
of
the
crossings
would
have
cared
to
try
his
fortune
but
the
person
who
had
attracted
dyson
attention
seemed
to
rage
on
the
very
edge
of
the
pavement
now
and
then
darting
forward
at
the
hazard
of
instant
death
and
at
each
repulse
absolutely
dancing
with
excitement
to
the
rich
amusement
of
the
at
last
a
gap
that
would
have
tried
the
courage
of
a
appeared
between
the
serried
lines
of
vehicles
and
the
man
rushed
across
in
a
frenzy
and
escaping
by
a
hair
breadth
pounced
upon
dyson
as
a
tiger
pounces
on
her
prey
i
saw
you
looking
about
you
he
said
sputtering
out
his
words
in
his
intense
eagerness
would
you
mind
telling
me
this
was
the
man
who
came
out
of
the
aerated
bread
shop
and
jumped
into
the
hansom
three
minutes
ago
a
youngish
looking
man
with
dark
whiskers
and
spectacles
ca
you
speak
man
for
heaven
sake
ca
you
speak
answer
me
it
a
matter
of
life
and
death
the
words
bubbled
and
boiled
out
of
the
man
mouth
in
the
fury
of
his
emotion
his
face
went
from
red
to
white
and
the
beads
of
sweat
stood
out
on
his
forehead
and
he
stamped
his
feet
as
he
spoke
and
tore
with
his
hand
at
his
coat
as
if
something
swelled
and
choked
him
stopping
the
passage
of
his
breath
my
dear
sir
said
dyson
i
always
like
to
be
accurate
your
observation
was
perfectly
correct
as
you
say
a
youngish
man
a
man
i
should
say
of
somewhat
timid
bearing
ran
rapidly
out
of
the
shop
here
and
bounced
into
a
hansom
that
must
have
been
waiting
for
him
as
it
went
eastwards
at
once
your
friend
also
wore
spectacles
as
you
say
perhaps
you
would
like
me
to
call
a
hansom
for
you
to
follow
the
gentleman
no
thank
you
it
would
be
waste
of
time
the
man
gulped
down
something
which
appeared
to
rise
in
his
throat
and
dyson
was
alarmed
to
see
him
shaking
with
hysterical
laughter
and
he
clung
hard
to
a
and
swayed
and
staggered
like
a
ship
in
a
heavy
gale
how
shall
i
face
the
doctor
he
murmured
to
himself
it
is
too
hard
to
fail
at
the
last
moment
then
he
seemed
to
recollect
himself
and
stood
straight
again
and
looked
quietly
at
dyson
i
owe
you
an
apology
for
my
violence
he
said
at
last
many
men
would
not
be
so
patient
as
you
have
been
would
you
mind
adding
to
your
kindness
by
walking
with
me
a
little
way
i
feel
a
little
sick
i
think
it
the
sun
dyson
nodded
assent
and
devoted
himself
to
a
quiet
scrutiny
of
this
strange
personage
as
they
moved
on
together
the
man
was
dressed
in
quiet
taste
and
the
most
scrupulous
observer
could
find
nothing
amiss
with
the
fashion
or
make
of
his
clothes
yet
from
his
hat
to
his
boots
everything
seemed
inappropriate
his
silk
hat
dyson
thought
should
have
been
a
high
bowler
of
odious
pattern
worn
with
a
baggy
and
an
instinct
told
him
that
the
fellow
did
not
commonly
carry
a
clean
the
face
was
not
of
the
most
agreeable
pattern
and
was
in
no
way
improved
by
a
pair
of
bulbous
of
a
ginger
hue
into
which
mustaches
of
light
color
merged
imperceptibly
yet
in
spite
of
these
signals
hung
out
by
nature
dyson
felt
that
the
individual
beside
him
was
something
more
than
compact
of
vulgarity
he
was
struggling
with
himself
holding
his
feelings
in
check
but
now
and
again
passion
would
mount
black
to
his
face
and
it
was
evidently
by
a
supreme
effort
that
he
kept
himself
from
raging
like
a
madman
dyson
found
something
curious
and
a
little
terrible
in
the
spectacle
of
an
occult
emotion
thus
striving
for
the
mastery
and
threatening
to
break
out
at
every
instant
with
violence
and
they
had
gone
some
distance
before
the
person
whom
he
had
met
by
so
odd
a
hazard
was
able
to
speak
quietly
you
are
really
very
good
he
said
i
apologize
again
my
rudeness
was
really
most
unjustifiable
i
feel
my
conduct
demands
an
explanation
and
i
shall
be
happy
to
give
it
you
do
you
happen
to
know
of
any
place
near
here
where
one
could
sit
down
i
should
really
be
very
glad
my
dear
sir
said
dyson
solemnly
the
only
café
in
london
is
close
by
pray
do
not
consider
yourself
as
bound
to
offer
me
any
explanation
but
at
the
same
time
i
should
be
most
happy
to
listen
to
you
let
us
turn
down
here
they
walked
down
a
sober
street
and
turned
into
what
seemed
a
narrow
passage
past
an
gate
thrown
back
the
passage
was
paved
with
flagstones
and
decorated
with
handsome
shrubs
in
pots
on
either
side
and
the
shadow
of
the
high
walls
made
a
coolness
which
was
very
agreeable
after
the
hot
breath
of
the
sunny
street
presently
the
passage
opened
out
into
a
tiny
square
a
charming
place
a
morsel
of
france
transplanted
into
the
heart
of
london
high
walls
rose
on
either
side
covered
with
glossy
creepers
beneath
were
gay
with
nasturtiums
geraniums
and
marigolds
and
odorous
with
mignonette
and
in
the
centre
of
the
square
a
fountain
hidden
by
greenery
sent
a
cool
shower
continually
plashing
into
the
basin
beneath
and
the
very
noise
made
this
retreat
delightful
chairs
and
tables
were
disposed
at
convenient
intervals
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
court
broad
doors
had
been
thrown
back
beyond
was
a
long
dark
room
and
the
turmoil
of
traffic
had
become
a
distant
murmur
within
the
room
one
or
two
men
were
sitting
at
the
tables
writing
and
sipping
but
the
courtyard
was
empty
you
see
we
shall
be
quiet
said
dyson
pray
sit
down
here
wilkins
my
name
is
henry
wilkins
sit
here
wilkins
i
think
you
will
find
that
a
comfortable
seat
i
suppose
you
have
not
been
here
before
this
is
the
quiet
time
the
place
will
be
like
a
hive
at
six
and
the
chairs
and
tables
will
overflow
into
that
little
alley
there
a
waiter
came
in
response
to
the
bell
and
after
dyson
had
politely
inquired
after
the
health
of
annibault
the
proprietor
he
ordered
a
bottle
of
the
wine
of
champigny
the
wine
of
champigny
he
observed
to
wilkins
who
was
evidently
a
good
deal
composed
by
the
influence
of
the
place
is
a
tourainian
wine
of
great
merit
ah
here
it
is
let
me
fill
your
glass
how
do
you
find
it
indeed
said
wilkins
i
should
have
pronounced
it
a
fine
burgundy
the
bouquet
is
very
exquisite
i
am
fortunate
in
lighting
upon
such
a
good
samaritan
as
yourself
i
wonder
you
did
not
think
me
mad
but
if
you
knew
the
terrors
that
assailed
me
i
am
sure
you
would
no
longer
be
surprised
at
conduct
which
was
certainly
most
unjustifiable
he
sipped
his
wine
and
leant
back
in
his
chair
relishing
the
drip
and
trickle
of
the
fountain
and
the
cool
greenness
that
hedged
in
this
little
port
of
refuge
yes
he
said
at
last
that
is
indeed
an
admirable
wine
thank
you
you
will
allow
me
to
offer
you
another
bottle
the
waiter
was
summoned
and
descended
through
a
in
the
floor
of
the
dark
apartment
and
brought
up
the
wine
wilkins
lit
a
cigarette
and
dyson
pulled
out
his
pipe
now
said
wilkins
i
promised
to
give
you
an
explanation
of
my
strange
behavior
it
is
rather
a
long
story
but
i
see
sir
that
you
are
no
mere
cold
observer
of
the
ebb
and
flow
of
life
you
take
i
think
a
warm
and
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
chances
of
your
and
i
believe
you
will
find
what
i
have
to
tell
not
devoid
of
interest
dyson
signified
his
assent
to
these
propositions
and
though
he
thought
wilkins
diction
a
little
pompous
prepared
to
interest
himself
in
his
tale
the
other
who
had
so
raged
with
passion
half
an
hour
before
was
now
perfectly
cool
and
when
he
had
smoked
out
his
cigarette
he
began
in
an
even
voice
to
relate
the
novel
of
the
dark
valley
i
am
the
son
of
a
poor
but
learned
clergyman
in
the
west
of
england
but
i
am
forgetting
these
details
are
not
of
special
interest
i
will
briefly
state
then
that
my
father
who
was
as
i
have
said
a
learned
man
had
never
learnt
the
specious
arts
by
which
the
great
are
flattered
and
would
never
condescend
to
the
despicable
pursuit
of
though
his
fondness
for
ancient
ceremonies
and
quaint
customs
combined
with
a
kindness
of
heart
that
was
unequalled
and
a
primitive
and
fervent
piety
endeared
him
to
his
parishioners
such
were
not
the
steps
by
which
clergy
then
rose
in
the
church
and
at
sixty
my
father
was
still
incumbent
of
the
little
benefice
he
had
accepted
in
his
thirtieth
year
the
income
of
the
living
was
barely
sufficient
to
support
life
in
the
decencies
which
are
expected
of
the
anglican
parson
and
when
my
father
died
a
few
years
ago
i
his
only
child
found
myself
thrown
upon
the
world
with
a
slender
capital
of
less
than
a
hundred
pounds
and
all
the
problem
of
existence
before
me
i
felt
that
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
in
the
country
and
as
usually
happens
in
such
eases
london
drew
me
like
a
magnet
one
day
in
august
in
the
early
morning
while
the
dew
still
glittered
on
the
turf
and
on
the
high
green
banks
of
the
lane
a
neighbor
drove
me
to
the
railway
station
and
i
bade
to
the
land
of
the
broad
moors
and
unearthly
battlements
of
the
wild
tors
it
was
six
as
we
neared
london
the
faint
sickly
fume
of
the
brickfields
about
acton
came
in
puffs
through
the
open
window
and
a
mist
was
rising
from
the
ground
presently
the
brief
view
of
successive
streets
prim
and
uniform
struck
me
with
a
sense
of
monotony
the
hot
air
seemed
to
grow
hotter
and
when
we
had
rolled
beneath
the
dismal
and
squalid
houses
whose
dirty
and
neglected
back
yards
border
the
line
near
paddington
i
felt
as
if
i
should
be
stifled
in
this
fainting
breath
of
london
i
got
a
hansom
and
drove
off
and
every
street
increased
my
gloom
gray
houses
with
blinds
drawn
down
whole
thoroughfares
almost
desolate
and
the
who
seemed
to
stagger
wearily
along
rather
than
walk
all
made
me
feel
a
sinking
at
heart
i
put
up
for
the
night
at
a
small
hotel
in
a
street
leading
from
the
strand
where
my
father
had
stayed
on
his
few
brief
visits
to
town
and
when
i
went
out
after
dinner
the
real
gayety
and
bustle
of
the
strand
and
fleet
street
could
cheer
me
but
little
for
in
all
this
great
city
there
was
no
single
human
being
whom
i
could
claim
even
as
an
acquaintance
i
will
not
weary
you
with
the
history
of
the
next
year
for
the
adventures
of
a
man
who
sinks
are
too
trite
to
be
worth
recalling
my
money
did
not
last
me
long
i
found
that
i
must
be
neatly
dressed
or
no
one
to
whom
i
applied
would
so
much
as
listen
to
me
and
i
must
live
in
a
street
of
decent
reputation
if
i
wished
to
be
treated
with
common
civility
i
applied
for
various
posts
for
which
as
i
now
see
i
was
completely
devoid
of
qualification
i
tried
to
become
a
clerk
without
having
the
smallest
notion
of
business
habits
and
i
found
to
my
cost
that
a
general
knowledge
of
literature
and
an
execrable
style
of
penmanship
are
far
from
being
looked
upon
with
favor
in
commercial
circles
i
had
read
one
of
the
most
charming
of
the
works
of
a
famous
novelist
of
the
present
day
and
i
frequented
the
fleet
street
taverns
in
the
hope
of
making
literary
friends
and
so
getting
the
introductions
which
i
understood
were
indispensable
in
the
career
of
letters
i
was
disappointed
i
once
or
twice
ventured
to
address
gentlemen
who
were
sitting
in
adjoining
boxes
and
i
was
answered
politely
indeed
but
in
a
manner
that
told
me
my
advances
were
unusual
pound
by
pound
my
small
resources
melted
i
could
no
longer
think
of
appearances
i
migrated
to
a
shy
quarter
and
my
meals
became
mere
observances
i
went
out
at
one
and
returned
to
my
room
at
two
but
nothing
but
a
had
occurred
in
the
interval
in
short
i
became
acquainted
with
misfortune
and
as
i
sat
amidst
slush
and
ice
on
a
seat
in
hyde
park
munching
a
piece
of
bread
i
realized
the
bitterness
of
poverty
and
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
reduced
to
something
far
below
the
condition
of
a
vagrant
in
spite
of
all
discouragement
i
did
not
desist
in
my
efforts
to
earn
a
living
i
consulted
advertisement
columns
i
kept
my
eyes
open
for
a
chance
i
looked
in
at
the
windows
of
stationers
shops
but
all
in
vain
one
evening
i
was
sitting
in
a
free
library
and
i
saw
an
advertisement
in
one
of
the
papers
it
was
something
like
this
wanted
by
a
gentleman
a
person
of
literary
taste
and
abilities
as
secretary
and
amanuensis
must
not
object
to
travel
of
course
i
knew
that
such
an
advertisement
would
have
answers
by
the
hundred
and
i
thought
my
own
chances
of
securing
the
post
extremely
small
however
i
applied
at
the
address
given
and
wrote
to
smith
who
was
staying
at
a
large
hotel
at
the
west
end
i
must
confess
that
my
heart
gave
a
jump
when
i
received
a
note
a
couple
of
days
later
asking
me
to
call
at
the
cosmopole
at
my
earliest
convenience
i
do
not
know
sir
what
your
experiences
of
life
may
have
been
and
so
i
can
not
tell
whether
you
have
known
such
moments
a
slight
sickness
my
heart
beating
rather
more
rapidly
than
usual
a
choking
in
the
throat
and
a
difficulty
of
utterance
such
were
my
sensations
as
i
walked
to
the
cosmopole
i
had
to
mention
the
name
twice
before
the
hall
porter
could
understand
me
and
as
i
went
upstairs
my
hands
were
wet
i
was
a
good
deal
struck
by
smith
appearance
he
looked
younger
than
i
did
and
there
was
something
mild
and
hesitating
about
his
expression
he
was
reading
when
i
came
in
and
he
looked
up
when
i
gave
my
name
my
dear
sir
he
said
i
am
really
delighted
to
see
you
i
have
read
very
carefully
the
letter
you
were
good
enough
to
send
me
am
i
to
understand
that
this
document
is
in
your
own
handwriting
he
showed
me
the
letter
i
had
written
and
i
told
him
i
was
not
so
fortunate
as
to
be
able
to
keep
a
secretary
myself
then
sir
he
went
on
the
post
i
advertised
is
at
your
service
you
have
no
objection
to
travel
i
presume
as
you
may
imagine
i
closed
pretty
eagerly
with
the
offer
he
made
and
thus
i
entered
the
service
of
smith
for
the
first
few
weeks
i
had
no
special
duties
i
had
received
a
quarter
salary
and
a
handsome
allowance
was
made
me
in
lieu
of
board
and
lodging
one
morning
however
when
i
called
at
the
hotel
according
to
instructions
my
master
informed
me
that
i
must
hold
myself
in
readiness
for
a
and
to
spare
unnecessary
detail
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight
we
had
landed
at
new
york
smith
told
me
that
he
was
engaged
on
a
work
of
a
special
nature
in
the
compilation
of
which
some
peculiar
researches
had
to
be
made
in
short
i
was
given
to
understand
that
we
were
to
travel
to
the
far
west
after
about
a
week
had
been
spent
in
new
york
we
took
our
seats
in
the
cars
and
began
a
journey
tedious
beyond
all
conception
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
the
great
train
rolled
on
threading
its
way
through
cities
the
very
names
of
which
were
strange
to
me
passing
at
slow
speed
over
perilous
viaducts
skirting
mountain
ranges
and
pine
forests
and
plunging
into
dense
tracts
of
wood
where
mile
after
mile
and
hour
after
hour
the
same
monotonous
growth
of
brushwood
met
the
eye
and
all
along
the
continual
clatter
and
rattle
of
the
wheels
upon
the
lines
made
it
difficult
to
hear
the
voices
of
our
we
were
a
heterogeneous
and
company
often
i
woke
up
in
the
dead
of
night
with
the
sudden
grinding
jar
of
the
brakes
and
looking
out
found
that
we
had
stopped
in
the
shabby
street
of
some
town
lighted
chiefly
by
the
flaring
windows
of
the
saloon
a
few
fellows
would
often
come
out
to
stare
at
the
cars
and
sometimes
passengers
got
down
and
sometimes
there
was
a
party
of
two
or
three
waiting
on
the
wooden
sidewalk
to
get
on
board
many
of
the
passengers
were
english
humble
households
torn
up
from
the
moorings
of
a
thousand
years
and
bound
for
some
problematical
paradise
in
the
alkali
desert
or
the
rockies
i
heard
the
men
talking
to
one
another
of
the
great
profits
to
be
made
on
the
virgin
soil
of
america
and
two
or
three
who
were
mechanics
expatiated
on
the
wonderful
wages
given
to
skilled
labor
on
the
railways
and
in
the
factories
of
the
states
this
talk
usually
fell
dead
after
a
few
minutes
and
i
could
see
a
sickness
and
dismay
in
the
faces
of
these
men
as
they
looked
at
the
ugly
brush
or
at
the
desolate
expanse
of
the
prairie
dotted
here
and
there
with
devoid
of
garden
or
flowers
or
trees
standing
all
alone
in
what
might
have
been
a
great
gray
sea
frozen
into
stillness
day
after
day
the
waving
sky
line
and
the
desolation
of
a
land
without
form
or
color
or
variety
appalled
the
hearts
of
such
of
us
as
were
englishmen
and
once
in
the
night
as
i
lay
awake
i
heard
a
woman
weeping
and
sobbing
and
asking
what
she
had
done
to
come
to
such
a
place
her
husband
tried
to
comfort
her
in
the
broad
speech
of
gloucestershire
telling
her
the
ground
was
so
rich
that
one
had
only
to
plough
it
up
and
it
would
grow
sunflowers
of
itself
but
she
cried
for
her
mother
and
their
old
cottage
and
the
beehives
like
a
little
child
the
sadness
of
it
all
overwhelmed
me
and
i
had
no
heart
to
think
of
other
matters
the
question
of
what
smith
could
have
to
do
in
such
a
country
and
of
what
manner
of
literary
research
could
be
carried
on
in
the
wilderness
hardly
troubled
me
now
and
again
my
situation
struck
me
as
peculiar
i
had
been
engaged
as
a
literary
assistant
at
a
handsome
salary
and
yet
my
master
was
still
almost
a
stranger
to
me
sometimes
he
would
come
to
where
i
was
sitting
in
the
cars
and
make
a
few
banal
remarks
about
the
country
but
for
the
most
part
of
the
journey
he
sat
by
himself
not
speaking
to
any
one
and
so
far
as
i
could
judge
deep
in
his
thoughts
it
was
i
think
on
the
fifth
day
from
new
york
when
i
received
the
intimation
that
we
should
shortly
leave
the
cars
i
had
been
watching
some
distant
mountains
which
rose
wild
and
savage
before
us
and
i
was
wondering
if
there
were
human
beings
so
unhappy
as
to
speak
of
home
in
connection
with
those
piles
of
lumbered
rock
when
smith
touched
me
lightly
on
the
shoulder
you
will
be
glad
to
be
done
with
the
cars
i
have
no
doubt
wilkins
he
said
you
were
looking
at
the
mountains
i
think
well
i
hope
we
shall
be
there
the
train
stops
at
reading
and
i
dare
say
we
shall
manage
to
find
our
way
a
few
hours
later
the
brakeman
brought
the
tram
to
a
standstill
at
the
reading
depot
and
we
got
out
i
noticed
that
the
town
though
of
course
built
almost
entirely
of
was
larger
and
busier
than
any
we
had
passed
for
the
last
two
days
the
depot
was
crowded
and
as
the
bell
and
whistle
sounded
i
saw
that
a
number
of
persons
were
preparing
to
leave
the
cars
while
an
even
greater
number
were
waiting
to
get
on
board
besides
the
passengers
there
was
a
pretty
dense
crowd
of
people
some
of
whom
had
come
to
meet
or
to
see
off
their
friends
and
relatives
while
others
were
mere
loafers
several
of
our
english
fellow
passengers
got
down
at
reading
but
the
confusion
was
so
great
that
they
were
lost
to
my
sight
almost
immediately
smith
beckoned
to
me
to
follow
him
and
we
were
soon
in
the
thick
of
the
mass
and
the
continual
ringing
of
bells
the
hubbub
of
voices
the
shrieking
of
whistles
and
the
hiss
of
escaping
steam
confused
my
senses
and
i
wondered
dimly
as
i
struggled
after
my
employer
where
we
were
going
and
how
we
should
be
able
to
find
our
way
through
an
unknown
country
smith
had
put
on
a
hat
which
he
had
sloped
over
his
eyes
and
as
all
the
men
wore
hats
of
the
same
pattern
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
i
distinguished
him
in
the
crowd
we
got
free
at
last
and
he
struck
down
a
side
street
and
made
one
or
two
sharp
turns
to
right
and
left
it
was
getting
dusk
and
we
seemed
to
be
passing
through
a
shy
portion
of
the
town
there
were
few
people
about
in
the
streets
and
these
few
were
men
of
the
most
unprepossessing
pattern
suddenly
we
stopped
before
a
corner
house
a
man
was
standing
at
the
door
apparently
on
the
for
some
one
and
i
noticed
that
he
and
smith
gave
sharp
glances
one
to
the
other
from
new
york
city
i
expect
mister
from
new
york
all
right
they
ready
and
you
can
have
when
you
choose
i
know
my
orders
you
see
and
i
mean
to
run
this
business
through
very
well
evans
that
is
what
we
want
our
money
is
good
you
know
bring
them
round
i
had
stood
silent
listening
to
this
dialogue
and
wondering
what
it
meant
smith
began
to
walk
impatiently
up
and
down
the
street
and
the
man
evans
was
still
standing
at
his
door
he
had
given
a
sharp
whistle
and
i
saw
him
looking
me
over
in
a
quiet
leisurely
way
as
if
to
make
sure
of
my
face
for
another
time
i
was
thinking
what
all
this
could
mean
when
an
ugly
slouching
lad
came
up
a
side
passage
leading
two
horses
get
up
wilkins
and
be
quick
about
it
said
smith
we
ought
to
be
on
our
way
we
rode
off
together
into
the
gathering
darkness
and
before
long
i
looked
back
and
saw
the
far
plain
behind
us
with
the
lights
of
the
town
glimmering
faintly
and
in
front
rose
the
mountains
smith
guided
his
horse
on
the
rough
track
as
surely
as
if
he
had
been
riding
along
piccadilly
and
i
followed
him
as
well
as
i
could
i
was
weary
and
exhausted
and
scarcely
took
note
of
anything
i
felt
that
the
track
was
a
gradual
ascent
and
here
and
there
i
saw
great
boulders
by
the
road
the
ride
made
but
little
impression
on
me
i
have
a
faint
recollection
of
passing
through
a
dense
black
pine
forest
where
our
horses
had
to
pick
their
way
among
the
rocks
and
i
remember
the
peculiar
effect
of
the
rarefied
air
as
we
kept
still
mounting
higher
and
higher
i
think
i
must
have
been
half
asleep
for
the
latter
half
of
the
ride
and
it
was
with
a
shock
that
i
heard
smith
saying
here
we
are
wilkins
this
is
park
you
will
enjoy
the
view
we
will
have
something
to
eat
and
then
go
to
bed
a
man
came
out
of
a
house
and
took
the
horses
and
we
found
some
fried
steak
and
coarse
whiskey
awaiting
us
inside
i
had
come
to
a
strange
place
there
were
three
rooms
the
room
in
which
we
had
supper
smith
room
and
my
own
the
deaf
old
man
who
did
the
work
slept
in
a
sort
of
shed
and
when
i
woke
up
the
next
morning
and
walked
out
i
found
that
the
house
stood
in
a
sort
of
hollow
amongst
the
mountains
the
clumps
of
pines
and
some
enormous
rocks
that
stood
here
and
there
between
the
trees
had
given
the
place
the
name
of
park
on
every
side
the
mountains
surrounded
us
the
breath
of
the
air
was
as
wine
and
when
i
climbed
the
slope
and
looked
down
i
could
see
that
so
far
as
any
human
fellowship
was
concerned
i
might
as
well
have
been
wrecked
on
some
small
island
in
the
only
trace
of
man
i
could
see
was
the
rough
where
i
had
slept
and
in
my
ignorance
i
did
not
know
that
there
were
similar
houses
within
comparatively
easy
distance
as
distance
is
reckoned
in
the
rockies
but
at
the
moment
the
utter
dreadful
loneliness
rushed
upon
me
and
the
thought
of
the
great
plain
and
the
great
sea
that
parted
me
from
the
world
i
knew
caught
me
by
the
throat
and
i
wondered
if
i
should
die
there
in
that
mountain
hollow
it
was
a
terrible
instant
and
i
have
not
yet
forgotten
it
of
course
i
managed
to
conquer
my
horror
i
said
i
should
be
all
the
stronger
for
the
experience
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
make
the
best
of
everything
it
was
a
rough
life
enough
and
rough
enough
board
and
lodging
i
was
left
entirely
to
myself
smith
i
scarcely
ever
saw
nor
did
i
know
when
he
was
in
the
house
i
have
often
thought
he
was
far
away
and
have
been
surprised
to
see
him
walking
out
of
his
room
locking
the
door
behind
him
and
putting
the
key
in
his
pocket
and
on
several
occasions
when
i
fancied
he
was
busy
in
his
room
i
have
seen
him
come
in
with
his
boots
covered
with
dust
and
dirt
so
far
as
work
went
i
enjoyed
a
complete
sinecure
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
walk
about
the
valley
to
eat
and
to
sleep
with
one
thing
and
another
i
grew
accustomed
to
the
life
and
managed
to
make
myself
pretty
comfortable
and
by
degrees
i
began
to
venture
farther
away
from
the
house
and
to
explore
the
country
one
day
i
had
contrived
to
get
into
a
neighboring
valley
and
suddenly
i
came
upon
a
group
of
men
sawing
timber
i
went
up
to
them
hoping
that
perhaps
some
of
them
might
be
englishmen
at
all
events
they
were
human
beings
and
i
should
hear
articulate
speech
for
the
old
man
i
have
mentioned
besides
being
half
blind
and
stone
deaf
was
wholly
dumb
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
i
was
prepared
to
be
welcomed
in
a
rough
and
ready
fashion
without
much
of
the
forms
of
politeness
but
the
grim
glances
and
the
short
gruff
answers
i
received
astonished
me
i
saw
the
men
glancing
oddly
at
each
other
and
one
of
them
who
had
stopped
work
began
fingering
a
gun
and
i
was
obliged
to
return
on
my
path
uttering
curses
on
the
fate
which
had
brought
me
into
a
land
where
men
were
more
brutish
than
the
very
brutes
the
solitude
of
the
life
began
to
oppress
me
as
with
a
nightmare
and
a
few
days
later
i
determined
to
walk
to
a
kind
of
station
some
miles
distant
where
a
rough
inn
was
kept
for
the
accommodation
of
hunters
and
tourists
english
gentlemen
occasionally
stopped
there
for
the
night
and
i
thought
i
might
perhaps
fall
in
with
some
one
of
better
manners
than
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
i
found
as
i
had
expected
a
group
of
men
lounging
about
the
door
of
the
that
served
as
a
hotel
and
as
i
came
nearer
i
could
see
that
heads
were
put
together
and
looks
interchanged
and
when
i
walked
up
the
six
or
seven
trappers
stared
at
me
in
stony
ferocity
and
with
something
of
the
disgust
that
one
eyes
a
loathsome
and
venomous
snake
i
felt
that
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
i
called
out
is
there
such
a
thing
as
an
englishman
here
or
any
one
with
a
little
civilization
one
of
the
men
put
his
hand
to
his
belt
but
his
neighbor
checked
him
and
answered
me
you
find
we
got
some
of
the
resources
of
civilization
before
very
long
mister
and
i
expect
you
not
fancy
them
extremely
but
anyway
there
an
englishman
tarrying
here
and
i
no
doubt
he
be
glad
to
see
you
there
you
are
that
mr
a
young
man
dressed
like
an
english
country
squire
came
and
stood
at
the
door
and
looked
at
me
one
of
the
men
pointed
to
me
and
said
that
the
individual
we
were
talking
about
last
night
thought
you
might
like
to
have
a
look
at
him
squire
and
here
he
is
the
young
fellow
english
face
clouded
over
and
he
glanced
sternly
at
me
and
turned
away
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
and
aversion
sir
i
cried
i
do
not
know
what
i
have
done
to
be
treated
in
this
manner
you
are
my
and
i
expected
some
courtesy
he
gave
me
a
black
look
and
made
as
if
he
would
go
in
but
he
changed
his
mind
and
faced
me
you
are
rather
imprudent
i
think
to
behave
in
this
manner
you
must
be
counting
on
a
forbearance
which
can
not
last
very
long
which
may
last
a
very
short
time
indeed
and
let
me
tell
you
this
sir
you
may
call
yourself
an
englishman
and
drag
the
name
of
england
through
the
dirt
but
you
need
not
count
on
any
english
influence
to
help
you
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
stay
here
much
longer
he
went
into
the
inn
and
the
men
quietly
watched
my
face
as
i
stood
there
wondering
whether
i
was
going
mad
the
woman
of
the
house
came
out
and
stared
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
wild
beast
or
a
savage
and
i
turned
to
her
and
spoke
quietly
i
am
very
hungry
and
thirsty
i
have
walked
a
long
way
i
have
plenty
of
money
will
you
give
me
something
to
eat
and
drink
no
i
wo
she
said
you
had
better
quit
this
i
crawled
home
like
a
wounded
beast
and
lay
down
on
my
bed
it
was
all
a
hopeless
puzzle
to
me
i
knew
nothing
but
rage
and
shame
and
terror
and
i
suffered
little
more
when
i
passed
by
a
house
in
an
adjacent
valley
and
some
children
who
were
playing
outside
ran
from
me
shrieking
i
was
forced
to
walk
to
find
some
occupation
i
should
have
died
if
i
had
sat
down
quietly
in
blue
rock
park
and
looked
all
day
at
the
mountains
but
wherever
i
saw
a
human
being
i
saw
the
same
glance
of
hatred
and
aversion
and
once
as
i
was
crossing
a
thick
brake
i
heard
a
shot
and
the
venomous
hiss
of
a
bullet
close
to
my
ear
one
day
i
heard
a
conversation
which
astounded
me
i
was
sitting
behind
a
rock
resting
and
two
men
came
along
the
track
and
halted
one
of
them
had
got
his
feet
entangled
in
some
wild
vines
and
swore
fiercely
but
the
other
laughed
and
said
they
were
useful
things
sometimes
what
the
hell
do
you
mean
oh
nothing
much
but
they
uncommon
tough
these
here
vines
and
sometimes
rope
is
skerse
and
dear
the
man
who
had
sworn
chuckled
at
this
and
i
heard
them
sit
down
and
light
their
pipes
have
you
seen
him
lately
asked
the
humorist
i
sighted
him
the
other
day
but
the
darned
bullet
went
high
he
got
his
master
luck
i
expect
sir
but
it
ca
last
much
longer
you
heard
about
him
going
to
jinks
and
trying
his
brass
but
the
young
britisher
downed
him
pretty
considerable
i
can
tell
you
what
the
devil
is
the
meaning
of
it
i
do
know
but
i
believe
it
have
to
be
finished
and
done
in
the
old
style
too
you
know
how
they
fix
the
niggers
yes
sir
i
seen
a
little
of
that
a
couple
of
gallons
of
kerosene
cost
a
dollar
at
brown
store
but
i
should
say
it
cheap
anyway
they
moved
off
after
this
and
i
lay
still
behind
the
rock
the
sweat
pouring
down
my
face
i
was
so
sick
that
i
could
barely
stand
and
i
walked
home
as
slowly
as
an
old
man
leaning
on
my
stick
i
knew
that
the
two
men
had
been
talking
about
me
and
i
knew
that
some
terrible
death
was
in
store
for
me
that
night
i
could
not
sleep
i
tossed
on
the
rough
bed
and
tortured
myself
to
find
out
the
meaning
of
it
all
at
last
in
the
very
dead
of
night
i
rose
from
the
bed
and
put
on
my
clothes
and
went
out
i
did
not
care
where
i
went
but
i
felt
that
i
must
walk
till
i
had
tired
myself
out
it
was
a
clear
moonlight
night
and
in
a
couple
of
hours
i
found
i
was
approaching
a
place
of
dismal
reputation
in
the
mountains
a
deep
cleft
in
the
rocks
known
as
black
gulf
cañon
many
years
before
an
unfortunate
party
of
englishmen
and
englishwomen
had
camped
here
and
had
been
surrounded
by
indians
they
were
captured
outraged
and
put
to
death
with
almost
inconceivable
tortures
and
the
roughest
of
the
trappers
or
woodsmen
gave
the
cañon
a
wide
berth
even
in
the
as
i
crushed
through
the
dense
brushwood
which
grew
above
the
cañon
i
heard
voices
and
wondering
who
could
be
in
such
a
place
at
such
a
time
i
went
on
walking
more
carefully
and
making
as
little
noise
as
possible
there
was
a
great
tree
growing
on
the
very
edge
of
the
rocks
and
i
lay
down
and
looked
out
from
behind
the
trunk
black
gulf
cañon
was
below
me
the
moonlight
shining
bright
into
its
very
depths
from
midheaven
and
casting
shadows
as
black
as
death
from
the
pointed
rock
and
all
the
sheer
rock
on
the
other
side
overhanging
the
cañon
was
in
darkness
at
intervals
a
light
veil
obscured
the
moonlight
as
a
filmy
cloud
fleeted
across
the
moon
and
a
bitter
wind
blew
shrill
across
the
gulf
i
looked
down
as
i
have
said
and
saw
twenty
men
standing
in
a
semicircle
round
a
rock
i
counted
them
one
by
one
and
knew
most
of
them
they
were
the
very
vilest
of
the
vile
more
vile
than
any
den
in
london
could
show
and
there
was
murder
and
worse
than
murder
on
the
heads
of
not
a
few
facing
them
and
me
stood
smith
with
the
rock
before
him
and
on
the
rock
was
a
great
pair
of
scales
such
as
are
used
in
the
stores
i
heard
his
voice
ringing
down
the
cañon
as
i
lay
beside
the
tree
and
my
heart
turned
cold
as
i
heard
it
life
for
gold
he
cried
a
life
for
gold
the
blood
and
the
life
of
an
enemy
for
every
pound
of
gold
a
man
stepped
out
and
raised
one
hand
and
with
the
other
flung
a
bright
lump
of
something
into
the
pan
of
the
scales
which
clanged
down
and
smith
muttered
something
in
his
ear
then
he
cried
again
blood
for
gold
for
a
pound
of
gold
the
life
of
an
enemy
for
every
pound
of
gold
upon
the
scales
a
life
one
by
one
the
men
came
forward
each
lifting
up
his
right
hand
and
the
gold
was
weighed
in
the
scales
and
each
time
smith
leaned
forward
and
spoke
to
each
man
in
his
ear
then
he
cried
again
desire
and
lust
for
gold
on
the
scales
for
every
pound
of
gold
enjoyment
of
desire
i
saw
the
same
thing
happen
as
before
the
uplifted
hand
and
the
metal
weighed
and
the
mouth
whispering
and
black
passion
on
every
face
then
one
by
one
i
saw
the
men
again
step
up
to
smith
a
muttered
conversation
seemed
to
take
place
i
could
see
that
smith
was
explaining
and
directing
and
i
noticed
that
he
gesticulated
a
little
as
one
who
points
out
the
way
and
once
or
twice
he
moved
his
hands
quickly
as
if
he
would
show
that
the
path
was
clear
and
could
not
be
missed
i
kept
my
eyes
so
intently
on
his
figure
that
i
noted
little
else
and
at
last
it
was
with
a
start
that
i
realized
that
the
cañon
was
empty
a
moment
before
i
thought
i
had
seen
the
group
of
villainous
faces
and
the
two
standing
a
little
apart
by
the
rock
i
had
looked
down
a
moment
and
when
i
glanced
again
into
the
cañon
there
was
no
one
there
in
dumb
terror
i
made
my
way
home
and
i
fell
asleep
in
an
instant
from
exhaustion
no
doubt
i
should
have
slept
on
for
many
hours
but
when
i
woke
up
the
sun
was
only
rising
and
the
light
shone
in
on
my
bed
i
had
started
up
from
sleep
with
the
sensation
of
having
received
a
violent
shock
and
as
i
looked
in
confusion
about
me
i
saw
to
my
amazement
that
there
were
three
men
in
the
room
one
of
them
had
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
spoke
to
me
come
mister
wake
up
your
time
up
now
i
reckon
and
the
boys
are
waiting
for
you
outside
and
they
in
a
big
hurry
come
on
you
can
put
on
your
clothes
it
kind
of
chilly
this
morning
i
saw
the
other
two
men
smiling
sourly
at
each
other
but
i
understood
nothing
i
simply
pulled
on
my
clothes
and
said
i
was
ready
all
right
come
on
then
you
go
first
nichols
and
jim
and
i
will
give
the
gentleman
an
arm
they
took
me
out
into
the
sunlight
and
then
i
understood
the
meaning
of
a
dull
murmur
that
had
vaguely
perplexed
me
while
i
was
dressing
there
were
about
two
hundred
men
waiting
outside
and
some
women
too
and
when
they
saw
me
there
was
a
low
muttering
growl
i
did
not
know
what
i
had
done
but
that
noise
made
my
heart
beat
and
the
sweat
come
out
on
my
face
i
saw
confusedly
as
through
a
veil
the
tumult
and
tossing
of
the
crowd
discordant
voices
were
speaking
and
amongst
all
those
faces
there
was
not
one
glance
of
mercy
but
a
fury
of
lust
that
i
did
not
understand
i
found
myself
presently
walking
in
a
sort
of
procession
up
the
slope
of
the
valley
and
on
every
side
of
me
there
were
men
with
revolvers
in
their
hands
now
and
then
a
voice
struck
me
and
i
heard
words
and
sentences
of
which
i
could
form
no
connected
story
but
i
understood
that
there
was
one
sentence
of
execration
i
heard
scraps
of
stories
that
seemed
strange
and
improbable
some
one
was
talking
of
men
lured
by
cunning
devices
from
their
homes
and
murdered
with
hideous
tortures
found
writhing
like
wounded
snakes
in
dark
and
lonely
places
only
crying
for
some
one
to
stab
them
to
the
heart
and
so
end
their
torments
and
i
heard
another
voice
speaking
of
innocent
girls
who
had
vanished
for
a
day
or
two
and
then
had
come
back
and
died
blushing
red
with
shame
even
in
the
agonies
of
death
i
wondered
what
it
all
meant
and
what
was
to
happen
but
i
was
so
weary
that
i
walked
on
in
a
dream
scarcely
longing
for
anything
but
sleep
at
last
we
stopped
we
had
reached
the
summit
of
the
hill
overlooking
blue
rock
valley
and
i
saw
that
i
was
standing
beneath
a
clump
of
trees
where
i
had
often
sat
i
was
in
the
midst
of
a
ring
of
armed
men
and
i
saw
that
two
or
three
men
were
very
busy
with
piles
of
wood
while
others
were
fingering
a
rope
then
there
was
a
stir
in
the
crowd
and
a
man
was
pushed
forward
his
hands
and
feet
were
tightly
bound
with
cord
and
though
his
face
was
unutterably
villainous
i
pitied
him
for
the
agony
that
worked
his
features
and
twisted
his
lips
i
knew
him
he
was
amongst
those
that
had
gathered
round
smith
in
black
gulf
cañon
in
an
instant
he
was
unbound
and
stripped
naked
and
borne
beneath
one
of
the
trees
and
his
neck
encircled
by
a
noose
that
went
around
the
trunk
a
hoarse
voice
gave
some
kind
of
order
there
was
a
rush
of
feet
and
the
rope
tightened
and
there
before
me
i
saw
the
blackened
face
and
the
writhing
limbs
and
the
shameful
agony
of
death
one
after
another
half
a
dozen
men
all
of
whom
i
had
seen
in
the
cañon
the
night
before
were
strangled
before
me
and
their
bodies
were
flung
forth
on
the
ground
then
there
was
a
pause
and
the
man
who
had
roused
me
a
short
while
before
came
up
to
me
and
said
now
mister
it
your
turn
we
give
you
five
minutes
to
cast
up
your
accounts
and
when
that
clocked
by
the
living
god
we
will
burn
you
alive
at
that
tree
it
was
then
i
awoke
and
understood
i
cried
out
why
what
have
i
done
why
should
you
hurt
me
i
am
a
harmless
man
i
never
did
you
any
wrong
i
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
it
seemed
so
pitiful
and
it
was
such
a
terrible
death
what
have
i
done
i
cried
again
you
must
take
me
for
some
other
man
you
can
not
know
me
you
devil
said
the
man
at
my
side
we
know
you
well
enough
there
not
a
man
within
thirty
miles
of
this
that
wo
curse
jack
smith
when
you
are
burning
in
hell
my
name
is
not
smith
i
said
with
some
hope
left
in
me
my
name
is
wilkins
i
was
smith
secretary
but
i
knew
nothing
of
him
hark
at
the
black
liar
said
the
man
secretary
be
damned
you
were
clever
enough
i
dare
say
to
slink
out
at
night
and
keep
your
face
in
the
dark
but
we
tracked
you
out
at
last
but
your
time
up
come
along
i
was
dragged
to
the
tree
and
bound
to
it
with
chains
and
i
saw
the
piles
of
wood
heaped
all
about
me
and
shut
my
eyes
then
i
felt
myself
drenched
all
over
with
some
liquid
and
looked
again
and
a
woman
grinned
at
me
she
had
just
emptied
a
great
can
of
petroleum
over
me
and
over
the
wood
a
voice
shouted
fire
away
and
i
fainted
and
knew
nothing
more
when
i
opened
my
eyes
i
was
lying
on
a
bed
in
a
bare
comfortless
room
a
doctor
was
holding
some
strong
salts
to
my
nostrils
and
a
gentleman
standing
by
the
bed
whom
i
afterwards
found
to
be
the
sheriff
addressed
me
say
mister
he
began
you
had
an
uncommon
narrow
squeak
for
it
the
boys
were
just
about
lighting
up
when
i
came
along
with
the
posse
and
i
had
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
bring
you
off
i
can
tell
you
and
mind
you
i
do
blame
them
they
had
made
up
their
minds
you
see
that
you
were
the
head
of
the
black
gulf
gang
and
at
first
nothing
i
could
say
would
persuade
them
you
were
jack
smith
luckily
a
man
from
here
named
evans
that
came
along
with
us
allowed
he
had
seen
you
with
jack
smith
and
that
you
were
yourself
so
we
brought
you
along
and
jailed
you
but
you
can
go
if
you
like
when
you
through
with
this
faint
turn
i
got
on
the
cars
the
next
day
and
in
three
weeks
i
was
in
london
again
almost
penniless
but
from
that
time
my
fortune
seemed
to
change
i
made
influential
friends
in
all
directions
bank
directors
courted
my
company
and
editors
positively
flung
themselves
into
my
arms
i
had
only
to
choose
my
career
and
after
a
while
i
determined
that
i
was
meant
by
nature
for
a
life
of
comparative
leisure
with
an
ease
that
seemed
almost
ridiculous
i
obtained
a
position
in
connection
with
a
prosperous
political
club
i
have
charming
chambers
in
a
central
neighborhood
close
to
the
parks
the
club
exerts
himself
when
i
lunch
or
dine
and
the
rarest
vintages
in
the
cellar
are
always
at
my
disposal
yet
since
my
return
to
london
i
have
never
known
a
security
or
peace
i
tremble
when
i
awake
lest
smith
should
be
standing
at
my
bed
and
every
step
i
take
seems
to
bring
me
nearer
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
smith
i
knew
had
escaped
free
from
the
raid
of
the
vigilantes
and
i
grew
faint
at
the
thought
that
he
would
in
all
probability
return
to
london
and
that
suddenly
and
unprepared
i
should
meet
him
face
to
face
every
morning
as
i
left
my
house
i
would
peer
up
and
down
the
street
expecting
to
see
that
dreaded
figure
awaiting
me
i
have
delayed
at
street
corners
my
heart
in
my
mouth
sickening
at
the
thought
that
a
few
quick
steps
might
bring
us
together
i
could
not
bear
to
frequent
the
theatres
or
music
halls
lest
by
some
bizarre
chance
he
should
prove
to
be
my
neighbor
sometimes
i
have
been
forced
against
my
will
to
walk
out
at
night
and
then
in
silent
squares
the
shadows
have
made
me
shudder
and
in
the
medley
of
meetings
in
the
crowded
thoroughfares
i
have
said
to
myself
it
must
come
sooner
or
later
he
will
surely
return
to
town
and
i
shall
see
him
when
i
feel
most
secure
i
scanned
the
newspapers
for
hint
or
intimation
of
approaching
danger
and
no
small
type
nor
report
of
trivial
interest
was
allowed
to
pass
unread
especially
i
read
and
the
advertisement
columns
but
without
result
months
passed
by
and
i
was
undisturbed
till
though
i
felt
far
from
safe
i
no
longer
suffered
from
the
intolerable
oppression
of
instant
and
ever
present
terror
this
afternoon
as
i
was
walking
quietly
along
oxford
street
i
raised
my
eyes
and
looked
across
the
road
and
then
at
last
i
saw
the
man
who
had
so
long
haunted
my
thoughts
wilkins
finished
his
wine
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
looking
sadly
at
dyson
and
then
as
if
a
thought
struck
him
fished
out
of
an
inner
pocket
a
leather
letter
case
and
handed
a
newspaper
cutting
across
the
table
dyson
glanced
closely
at
the
slip
and
saw
that
it
had
been
extracted
from
the
columns
of
an
evening
paper
it
ran
as
follows
wholesale
lynching
shocking
story
a
dalziel
telegram
from
reading
colorado
states
that
advices
received
there
from
blue
bock
park
report
a
frightful
instance
of
popular
vengeance
for
some
time
the
neighborhood
has
been
terrorized
by
the
crimes
of
a
gang
of
desperadoes
who
under
the
cover
of
a
carefully
planned
organization
have
perpetrated
the
most
infamous
cruelties
on
men
and
women
a
vigilance
committee
was
formed
and
it
was
found
that
the
leader
of
the
gang
was
a
person
named
smith
living
in
blue
rock
park
action
was
taken
and
six
of
the
worst
in
the
band
were
summarily
strangled
in
the
presence
of
two
or
three
hundred
men
and
women
smith
is
said
to
have
escaped
this
is
a
terrible
story
said
dyson
i
can
well
believe
that
your
days
and
nights
are
haunted
by
such
fearful
scenes
as
you
have
described
but
surely
you
have
no
need
to
fear
smith
he
has
much
more
cause
to
fear
you
consider
you
have
only
to
lay
your
information
before
the
police
and
a
warrant
would
be
immediately
issued
for
his
arrest
besides
you
will
i
am
sure
excuse
me
for
what
i
am
going
to
say
my
dear
sir
said
wilkins
i
hope
you
will
speak
to
me
with
perfect
freedom
well
then
i
must
confess
that
my
impression
was
that
you
were
rather
disappointed
at
not
being
able
to
stop
the
man
before
he
drove
off
i
thought
you
seemed
annoyed
that
you
could
not
get
across
the
street
sir
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
about
i
caught
sight
of
the
man
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
and
the
agony
you
witnessed
was
the
agony
of
suspense
i
was
not
perfectly
certain
of
the
face
and
the
horrible
thought
that
smith
was
again
in
london
overwhelmed
me
i
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
this
incarnate
fiend
whose
soul
is
black
with
shocking
crimes
mingling
free
and
unobserved
amongst
the
harmless
crowds
meditating
perhaps
a
new
and
more
fearful
cycle
of
infamies
i
tell
you
sir
that
an
awful
being
stalks
through
the
streets
a
being
before
whom
the
sunlight
itself
should
blacken
and
the
summer
air
grow
chill
and
dank
such
thoughts
as
these
rushed
upon
me
with
the
force
of
a
whirlwind
i
lost
my
senses
i
see
i
partly
understand
your
feelings
but
i
would
impress
on
you
that
you
have
nothing
really
to
fear
depend
upon
it
smith
will
not
molest
you
in
any
way
you
must
remember
he
himself
has
had
a
warning
and
indeed
from
the
brief
glance
i
had
of
him
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
man
however
i
see
it
is
getting
late
and
if
you
will
excuse
me
wilkins
i
think
i
will
be
going
i
dare
say
we
shall
often
meet
here
dyson
walked
off
smartly
pondering
the
strange
story
chance
had
brought
him
and
finding
on
cool
reflection
that
there
was
something
a
little
strange
in
wilkins
manner
for
which
not
even
so
weird
a
catalogue
of
experiences
could
altogether
account
adventure
of
the
missing
brother
charles
phillipps
was
as
has
been
hinted
a
gentleman
of
pronounced
scientific
tastes
in
his
early
days
he
had
devoted
himself
with
fond
enthusiasm
to
the
agreeable
study
of
biology
and
a
brief
monograph
on
the
embryology
of
the
microscopic
holothuria
had
formed
his
first
contribution
to
the
belles
lettres
later
he
had
somewhat
relaxed
the
severity
of
his
pursuits
and
had
dabbled
in
the
more
frivolous
subjects
of
palæontology
and
ethnology
he
had
a
cabinet
in
his
whose
drawers
were
stuffed
with
rude
flint
implements
and
a
charming
fetish
from
the
south
seas
was
the
dominant
note
in
the
decorative
scheme
of
the
apartment
flattering
himself
with
the
title
of
materialist
he
was
in
truth
one
of
the
most
credulous
of
men
but
he
required
a
marvel
to
be
neatly
draped
in
the
robes
of
science
before
he
would
give
it
any
credit
and
the
wildest
dreams
took
solid
shape
to
him
if
only
the
nomenclature
were
severe
and
irreproachable
he
laughed
at
the
witch
but
quailed
before
the
powers
of
the
hypnotist
lifting
his
eyebrows
when
christianity
was
mentioned
but
adoring
protyle
and
the
ether
for
the
rest
he
prided
himself
on
a
boundless
scepticism
the
average
tale
of
wonder
he
heard
with
nothing
but
contempt
and
he
would
certainly
not
have
credited
a
word
or
syllable
of
dyson
story
of
the
pursuer
and
pursued
unless
the
gold
coin
had
been
produced
as
visible
and
tangible
evidence
as
it
was
he
half
suspected
that
dyson
had
imposed
on
him
he
knew
his
friend
disordered
fancies
and
his
habit
of
conjuring
up
the
marvellous
to
account
for
the
entirely
commonplace
and
on
the
whole
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
the
facts
in
the
odd
adventure
had
been
gravely
distorted
in
the
telling
since
the
evening
on
which
he
had
listened
to
the
tale
he
had
paid
dyson
a
visit
and
had
delivered
himself
of
some
serious
talk
on
the
necessity
of
accurate
observation
and
the
folly
as
he
put
it
of
using
a
kaleidoscope
instead
of
a
telescope
in
the
view
of
things
to
which
remarks
his
friend
had
listened
with
a
smile
that
was
extremely
sardonic
my
dear
fellow
dyson
had
remarked
at
last
you
will
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
i
see
your
drift
perfectly
however
you
will
be
astonished
to
hear
that
i
consider
you
to
be
the
visionary
while
i
am
a
sober
and
serious
spectator
of
human
life
you
have
gone
round
the
circle
and
while
you
fancy
yourself
far
in
the
golden
land
of
new
philosophies
you
are
in
reality
a
dweller
in
a
metaphorical
clapham
your
scepticism
has
defeated
itself
and
become
a
monstrous
credulity
you
are
in
fact
in
the
position
of
the
bat
or
owl
i
forget
which
it
was
who
denied
the
existence
of
the
sun
at
noonday
and
i
shall
be
astonished
if
you
do
not
one
day
come
to
me
full
of
contrition
for
your
manifold
intellectual
errors
with
a
humble
resolution
to
see
things
in
their
true
light
for
the
future
this
tirade
had
left
phillipps
unimpressed
he
considered
dyson
as
hopeless
and
he
went
home
to
gloat
over
some
primitive
stone
implements
that
a
friend
had
sent
him
from
india
he
found
that
his
landlady
seeing
them
displayed
in
all
their
rude
formlessness
upon
the
table
had
removed
the
collection
to
the
dustbin
and
had
replaced
it
by
lunch
and
the
afternoon
was
spent
in
malodorous
research
brown
hearing
these
stones
spoken
of
as
very
valuable
knives
had
called
him
in
his
hearing
poor
phillipps
and
between
rage
and
evil
odors
he
spent
a
sorry
afternoon
it
was
four
before
he
had
completed
his
work
of
rescue
and
overpowered
with
the
flavors
of
decaying
phillipps
felt
that
he
must
have
a
walk
to
gain
an
appetite
for
the
evening
meal
unlike
dyson
he
walked
fast
with
his
eyes
on
the
pavement
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
and
oblivious
of
the
life
around
him
and
he
could
not
have
told
by
what
streets
he
had
passed
when
he
suddenly
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
found
himself
in
leicester
square
the
grass
and
flowers
pleased
him
and
he
welcomed
the
opportunity
of
resting
for
a
few
minutes
and
glancing
round
he
saw
a
bench
which
had
only
one
occupant
a
lady
and
as
she
was
seated
at
one
end
phillipps
took
up
a
position
at
the
other
extremity
and
began
to
pass
in
angry
review
the
events
of
the
afternoon
he
had
noticed
as
he
came
up
to
the
bench
that
the
person
already
there
was
neatly
dressed
and
to
all
appearance
young
her
face
he
could
not
see
as
it
was
turned
away
in
apparent
contemplation
of
the
shrubs
and
moreover
shielded
with
her
hand
but
it
would
be
doing
wrong
to
phillipps
to
imagine
that
his
choice
of
a
seat
was
dictated
by
any
hopes
of
an
affair
of
the
heart
he
had
simply
preferred
the
company
of
one
lady
to
that
of
five
dirty
children
and
having
seated
himself
was
immersed
directly
in
thoughts
of
his
misfortunes
he
had
meditated
changing
his
lodgings
but
now
on
a
judicial
review
of
the
case
in
all
its
bearings
his
calmer
judgment
told
him
that
the
race
of
landladies
is
like
to
the
race
of
the
leaves
and
that
there
was
but
little
to
choose
between
them
he
resolved
however
to
talk
to
brown
the
offender
very
coolly
and
yet
severely
to
point
out
the
extreme
indiscretion
of
her
conduct
and
to
express
a
hope
for
better
things
in
the
future
with
this
decision
registered
in
his
mind
phillipps
was
about
to
get
up
from
the
seat
and
move
off
when
he
was
intensely
annoyed
to
hear
a
stifled
sob
evidently
from
the
lady
who
still
continued
her
contemplation
of
the
shrubs
and
he
clutched
his
stick
desperately
and
in
a
moment
would
have
been
in
full
retreat
when
the
lady
turned
her
face
towards
him
and
with
a
mute
entreaty
bespoke
his
attention
she
was
a
young
girl
with
a
quaint
and
piquant
rather
than
a
beautiful
face
and
she
was
evidently
in
the
bitterest
distress
and
phillipps
sat
down
again
and
cursed
his
chances
heartily
the
young
lady
looked
at
him
with
a
pair
of
charming
eyes
of
a
shining
hazel
which
showed
no
trace
of
tears
though
a
handkerchief
was
in
her
hand
she
bit
her
lip
and
seemed
to
struggle
with
some
overpowering
grief
and
her
whole
attitude
was
all
beseeching
and
imploring
phillipps
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bench
gazing
awkwardly
at
her
and
wondering
what
was
to
come
next
and
she
looked
at
him
still
without
speaking
well
madam
he
said
at
last
i
understood
from
your
gesture
that
you
wished
to
speak
to
me
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
though
if
you
will
pardon
me
i
can
not
help
saying
that
that
seems
highly
improbable
ah
sir
she
said
in
a
low
murmuring
voice
do
not
speak
harshly
to
me
i
am
in
sore
straits
and
i
thought
from
your
face
that
i
could
safely
ask
your
sympathy
if
not
your
help
would
you
kindly
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
said
phillipps
perhaps
you
would
like
some
tea
i
knew
i
could
not
be
mistaken
the
lady
replied
that
offer
of
refreshment
bespeaks
a
generous
mind
but
tea
alas
is
powerless
to
console
me
if
you
will
let
me
i
will
endeavor
to
explain
my
trouble
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
i
will
do
so
and
i
will
try
and
be
brief
in
spite
of
the
numerous
complications
which
have
made
me
young
as
i
am
tremble
before
what
seems
the
profound
and
terrible
mystery
of
existence
yet
the
grief
which
now
racks
my
very
soul
is
but
too
simple
i
have
lost
my
brother
lost
your
brother
how
on
earth
can
that
be
i
see
i
must
trouble
you
with
a
few
particulars
my
brother
then
who
is
by
some
years
my
elder
is
a
tutor
in
a
private
school
in
the
extreme
north
of
london
the
want
of
means
deprived
him
of
the
advantages
of
a
university
education
and
lacking
the
stamp
of
a
degree
he
could
not
hope
for
that
position
which
his
scholarship
and
his
talents
entitled
him
to
claim
he
was
thus
forced
to
accept
the
post
of
classical
master
at
saunderson
highgate
academy
for
the
sons
of
gentlemen
and
he
has
performed
his
duties
with
perfect
satisfaction
to
his
principal
for
some
years
my
personal
history
need
not
trouble
you
if
will
be
enough
if
i
tell
you
that
for
the
last
month
i
have
been
governess
in
a
family
residing
at
tooting
my
brother
and
i
have
always
cherished
the
warmest
mutual
affection
and
though
circumstances
into
which
i
need
not
enter
have
kept
us
apart
for
some
time
yet
we
have
never
lost
sight
of
one
another
we
made
up
our
minds
that
unless
one
of
us
was
absolutely
unable
to
rise
from
a
bed
of
sickness
we
would
never
let
a
week
pass
by
without
meeting
and
some
time
ago
we
chose
this
square
as
our
rendezvous
on
account
of
its
central
position
and
its
convenience
of
access
and
indeed
after
a
week
of
distasteful
toil
my
brother
felt
little
inclination
for
much
walking
and
we
have
often
spent
two
or
three
hours
on
this
bench
speaking
of
our
prospects
and
of
happier
days
when
we
were
children
in
the
early
spring
it
was
cold
and
chilly
still
we
enjoyed
the
short
respite
and
i
think
that
we
were
often
taken
for
a
pair
of
lovers
as
we
sat
close
together
eagerly
talking
saturday
after
saturday
we
have
met
each
other
here
and
though
the
doctor
told
him
it
was
madness
my
brother
would
not
allow
the
influenza
to
break
the
appointment
that
was
some
time
ago
last
saturday
we
had
a
long
and
happy
afternoon
and
separated
more
cheerfully
than
usual
feeling
that
the
coming
week
would
be
bearable
and
resolving
that
our
next
meeting
should
be
if
possible
still
more
pleasant
i
arrived
here
at
the
time
agreed
upon
four
and
sat
down
and
watched
for
my
brother
expecting
every
moment
to
see
him
advancing
towards
me
from
that
gate
at
the
north
side
of
the
square
five
minutes
passed
by
and
he
had
not
arrived
i
thought
he
must
have
missed
his
train
and
the
idea
that
our
interview
would
be
cut
short
by
twenty
minutes
or
perhaps
half
an
hour
saddened
me
i
had
hoped
we
should
be
so
happy
together
suddenly
moved
by
i
know
not
what
impulse
i
turned
abruptly
round
and
how
can
i
describe
to
you
my
astonishment
when
i
saw
my
brother
advancing
slowly
towards
me
from
the
southern
side
of
the
square
accompanied
by
another
person
my
first
thought
i
remember
had
in
it
something
of
resentment
that
this
man
whoever
he
was
should
intrude
himself
into
our
meeting
i
wondered
who
it
could
possibly
be
for
my
brother
had
i
may
say
no
intimate
friends
then
as
i
looked
still
at
the
advancing
figures
another
feeling
took
possession
of
me
it
was
a
sensation
of
bristling
fear
the
fear
of
the
child
in
the
dark
unreasonable
and
unreasoning
but
terrible
clutching
at
my
heart
as
with
the
cold
grip
of
a
dead
man
hands
yet
i
overcame
the
feeling
and
looked
steadily
at
my
brother
waiting
for
him
to
speak
and
more
closely
at
his
companion
then
i
noticed
that
this
man
was
leading
my
brother
rather
than
walking
with
him
he
was
a
tall
man
dressed
in
quite
ordinary
fashion
he
wore
a
high
bowler
hat
and
in
spite
of
the
warmth
of
the
day
a
plain
black
overcoat
tightly
buttoned
and
i
noticed
his
trousers
of
a
quiet
black
and
gray
stripe
the
face
was
commonplace
too
and
indeed
i
can
not
recall
any
special
features
or
any
trick
of
expression
for
though
i
looked
at
him
as
he
came
near
curiously
enough
his
face
made
no
impression
on
me
it
was
as
though
i
had
seen
a
mask
they
passed
in
front
of
me
and
to
my
unutterable
astonishment
i
heard
my
brother
voice
speaking
to
me
though
his
lips
did
not
move
nor
his
eyes
look
into
mine
it
was
a
voice
i
can
not
describe
though
i
knew
it
but
the
words
came
to
my
ears
as
if
mingled
with
plashing
water
and
the
sound
of
a
shallow
brook
flowing
amidst
stones
i
heard
then
the
words
can
not
stay
and
for
a
moment
the
heavens
and
the
earth
seemed
to
rush
together
with
the
sound
of
thunder
and
i
was
thrust
forth
from
the
world
into
a
black
void
without
beginning
and
without
end
for
as
my
brother
passed
me
i
saw
the
hand
that
held
him
by
the
arm
and
seemed
to
guide
him
and
in
one
moment
of
horror
i
realized
that
it
was
as
a
formless
thing
that
has
mouldered
for
many
years
in
the
grave
the
flesh
was
peeled
in
strips
from
the
bones
and
hung
apart
dry
and
granulated
and
the
fingers
that
encircled
my
brother
arm
were
all
unshapen
things
and
one
was
but
a
stump
from
which
the
end
had
rotted
off
when
i
recovered
my
senses
i
saw
the
two
passing
out
by
that
gate
i
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
with
a
rush
as
of
fire
to
my
heart
i
knew
that
no
horror
could
stay
me
but
that
i
must
follow
my
brother
and
save
him
even
though
all
hell
rose
up
against
me
i
ran
out
and
looked
up
the
pavement
and
saw
the
two
figures
walking
amidst
the
crowd
i
ran
across
the
road
and
saw
them
turn
up
that
side
street
and
i
reached
the
corner
a
moment
later
in
vain
i
looked
to
right
and
left
for
neither
my
brother
nor
his
strange
guardian
was
in
sight
two
elderly
men
were
coming
down
and
a
telegraph
boy
was
walking
lustily
along
whistling
i
remained
there
a
moment
and
then
i
bowed
my
head
and
returned
to
this
seat
where
you
found
me
now
sir
do
you
wonder
at
my
grief
oh
tell
me
what
has
happened
to
my
brother
or
i
feel
i
shall
go
mad
phillipps
who
had
listened
with
exemplary
patience
to
this
tale
hesitated
a
moment
before
he
spoke
my
dear
madam
he
said
at
length
you
have
known
how
to
engage
me
in
your
service
not
only
as
a
man
but
as
a
student
of
science
as
a
i
pity
you
most
profoundly
you
must
have
suffered
extremely
from
what
you
saw
or
rather
from
what
you
fancied
you
saw
for
as
a
scientific
observer
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
the
plain
truth
which
indeed
besides
being
true
must
also
console
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
then
to
describe
your
brother
certainly
said
the
lady
eagerly
i
can
describe
him
accurately
my
brother
is
a
somewhat
man
he
is
pale
has
small
black
whiskers
and
wears
spectacles
he
has
rather
a
timid
almost
a
frightened
expression
and
looks
about
him
nervously
from
side
to
side
think
think
surely
you
must
have
seen
him
perhaps
you
are
an
of
this
engaging
quarter
you
may
have
met
him
on
some
previous
saturday
i
may
have
been
mistaken
in
supposing
that
he
turned
up
that
side
street
he
may
have
gone
on
and
you
may
have
passed
each
other
oh
tell
me
sir
whether
you
have
not
seen
him
i
am
afraid
i
do
not
keep
a
very
sharp
lookout
when
i
am
walking
said
phillipps
who
would
have
passed
his
mother
unnoticed
but
i
am
sure
your
description
is
admirable
and
now
will
you
describe
the
person
who
you
say
held
your
brother
by
the
arm
i
can
not
do
so
i
told
you
his
face
seemed
devoid
of
expression
or
salient
feature
it
was
like
a
mask
exactly
you
can
not
describe
what
you
have
never
seen
i
need
hardly
point
out
to
you
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
you
have
been
the
victim
of
an
hallucination
you
expected
to
see
your
brother
you
were
alarmed
because
you
did
not
see
him
and
unconsciously
no
doubt
your
brain
went
to
work
and
finally
you
saw
a
mere
projection
of
your
own
morbid
thoughts
a
vision
of
your
absent
brother
and
a
mere
confusion
of
terrors
incorporated
in
a
figure
which
you
ca
describe
of
course
your
brother
has
been
in
some
way
prevented
from
coming
to
meet
you
as
usual
i
expect
you
will
hear
from
him
in
a
day
or
two
the
lady
looked
seriously
at
phillipps
and
then
for
a
second
there
seemed
almost
a
twinkling
as
of
mirth
about
her
eyes
but
her
face
clouded
sadly
at
the
dogmatic
conclusions
to
which
the
scientist
was
led
so
irresistibly
ah
she
said
you
do
not
know
i
can
not
doubt
the
evidence
of
my
waking
senses
besides
perhaps
i
have
had
experiences
even
more
terrible
i
acknowledge
the
force
of
your
arguments
but
a
woman
has
intuitions
which
never
deceive
her
believe
me
i
am
not
hysterical
feel
my
pulse
it
is
quite
regular
she
stretched
out
her
hand
with
a
dainty
gesture
and
a
glance
that
enraptured
phillipps
in
spite
of
himself
the
hand
held
out
to
him
was
soft
and
white
and
warm
and
as
in
some
confusion
he
placed
his
fingers
on
the
purple
vein
he
felt
profoundly
touched
by
the
spectacle
of
love
and
grief
before
him
no
he
said
as
he
released
her
wrist
as
you
say
you
are
evidently
quite
yourself
still
you
must
be
aware
that
living
men
do
not
possess
dead
hands
that
sort
of
thing
does
happen
it
is
of
course
barely
possible
that
you
did
see
your
brother
with
another
gentleman
and
that
important
business
prevented
him
from
stopping
as
for
the
wonderful
hand
there
may
have
been
some
deformity
a
finger
shot
off
by
accident
or
something
of
that
sort
the
lady
shook
her
head
mournfully
i
see
you
are
a
determined
rationalist
she
said
did
you
not
hear
me
say
that
i
have
had
experiences
even
more
terrible
i
too
was
once
a
sceptic
but
after
what
i
have
known
i
can
no
longer
affect
to
doubt
madam
replied
phillipps
no
one
shall
make
me
deny
my
faith
i
will
never
believe
nor
will
i
pretend
to
believe
that
two
and
two
make
five
nor
will
i
on
any
pretences
admit
the
existence
of
triangles
you
are
a
little
hasty
rejoined
the
lady
but
may
i
ask
you
if
you
ever
heard
the
name
of
professor
gregg
the
authority
on
ethnology
and
kindred
subjects
i
have
done
much
more
than
merely
hear
of
professor
gregg
said
phillipps
i
always
regarded
him
as
one
of
our
most
acute
and
observers
and
his
last
publication
the
of
ethnology
struck
me
as
being
quite
admirable
in
its
kind
indeed
the
book
had
but
come
into
my
hands
when
i
heard
of
the
terrible
accident
which
cut
short
gregg
career
he
had
i
think
taken
a
country
house
in
the
west
of
england
for
the
summer
and
is
supposed
to
have
fallen
into
a
river
so
far
as
i
remember
his
body
was
never
recovered
sir
i
am
sure
that
you
are
discreet
your
conversation
seems
to
declare
as
much
and
the
very
title
of
that
little
work
of
yours
which
you
mentioned
assures
me
that
you
are
no
empty
trifler
in
a
word
i
feel
that
i
may
depend
on
you
you
appear
to
be
under
the
impression
that
professor
gregg
is
dead
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
that
is
the
case
what
cried
phillipps
astonished
and
perturbed
you
do
not
hint
that
there
was
anything
disgraceful
i
can
not
believe
it
gregg
was
a
man
of
clearest
character
his
private
life
was
one
of
great
benevolence
and
though
i
myself
am
free
from
delusions
i
believe
him
to
have
been
a
sincere
and
devout
christian
surely
you
can
not
mean
to
insinuate
that
some
disreputable
history
forced
him
to
flee
the
country
again
you
are
in
a
hurry
replied
the
lady
i
said
nothing
of
all
this
briefly
then
i
must
tell
you
that
professor
gregg
left
his
house
one
morning
in
full
health
both
of
mind
and
body
he
never
returned
but
his
watch
and
chain
a
purse
containing
three
sovereigns
in
gold
and
some
loose
silver
with
a
ring
that
he
wore
habitually
were
found
three
days
later
on
a
wild
and
savage
hillside
many
miles
from
the
river
these
articles
were
placed
beside
a
limestone
rock
of
fantastic
form
they
had
been
wrapped
into
a
parcel
with
a
kind
of
rough
parchment
which
was
secured
with
gut
the
parcel
was
opened
and
the
inner
side
of
the
parchment
bore
an
inscription
done
with
some
red
substance
the
characters
were
undecipherable
but
seemed
to
be
a
corrupt
cuneiform
you
interest
me
intensely
said
phillips
would
you
mind
continuing
your
story
the
circumstance
you
have
mentioned
seems
to
me
of
the
most
inexplicable
character
and
i
thirst
for
an
elucidation
the
young
lady
seemed
to
meditate
for
a
moment
and
she
then
proceeded
to
relate
the
novel
of
the
black
seal
i
must
now
give
you
some
fuller
particulars
of
my
history
i
am
the
daughter
of
a
civil
engineer
steven
lally
by
name
who
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
die
suddenly
at
the
outset
of
his
career
and
before
he
had
accumulated
sufficient
means
to
support
his
wife
and
her
two
children
my
mother
contrived
to
keep
the
small
household
going
on
resources
which
must
have
been
incredibly
small
we
lived
in
a
remote
country
village
because
most
of
the
necessaries
of
life
were
cheaper
than
in
a
town
but
even
so
we
were
brought
up
with
the
severest
economy
my
father
was
a
clever
and
man
and
left
behind
him
a
small
but
select
collection
of
books
containing
the
best
greek
latin
and
english
classics
and
these
books
were
the
only
amusement
we
possessed
my
brother
i
remember
learned
latin
out
of
meditationes
and
i
in
place
of
the
little
tales
which
children
are
usually
told
to
read
had
nothing
more
charming
than
a
translation
of
the
gesta
romanorum
we
grew
up
thus
quiet
and
studious
children
and
in
course
of
time
my
brother
provided
for
himself
in
the
manner
i
have
mentioned
i
continued
to
live
at
home
my
poor
mother
had
become
an
invalid
and
demanded
my
continual
care
and
about
two
years
ago
she
died
after
many
months
of
painful
illness
my
situation
was
a
terrible
one
the
shabby
furniture
barely
sufficed
to
pay
the
debts
i
had
been
forced
to
contract
and
the
books
i
despatched
to
my
brother
knowing
how
he
would
value
them
i
was
absolutely
alone
i
was
aware
how
poorly
my
brother
was
paid
and
though
i
came
up
to
london
in
the
hope
of
finding
employment
with
the
understanding
that
he
would
defray
my
expenses
i
swore
it
should
only
be
for
a
month
and
that
if
i
could
not
in
that
time
find
some
work
i
would
starve
rather
than
deprive
him
of
the
few
miserable
pounds
he
had
laid
by
for
his
day
of
trouble
i
took
a
little
room
in
a
distant
suburb
the
cheapest
that
i
could
find
i
lived
on
bread
and
tea
and
i
spent
my
time
in
vain
answering
of
advertisements
and
vainer
walks
to
addresses
i
had
noted
day
followed
on
day
and
week
on
week
and
still
i
was
unsuccessful
till
at
last
the
term
i
had
appointed
drew
to
a
close
and
i
saw
before
me
the
grim
prospect
of
slowly
dying
of
starvation
my
landlady
was
in
her
way
she
knew
the
slenderness
of
my
means
and
i
am
sure
that
she
would
not
have
turned
me
out
of
doors
it
remained
for
me
then
to
go
away
and
to
try
and
die
in
some
quiet
place
it
was
winter
then
and
a
thick
white
fog
gathered
in
the
early
part
of
the
afternoon
becoming
more
dense
as
the
day
wore
on
it
was
a
sunday
i
remember
and
the
people
of
the
house
were
at
chapel
at
about
three
i
crept
out
and
walked
away
as
quickly
as
i
could
for
i
was
weak
from
abstinence
the
white
mist
wrapped
all
the
streets
in
silence
and
a
hard
frost
had
gathered
thick
upon
the
bare
branches
of
the
trees
and
frost
crystals
glittered
on
the
wooden
fences
and
on
the
cold
cruel
ground
beneath
my
feet
i
walked
on
turning
to
right
and
left
in
utter
haphazard
without
caring
to
look
up
at
the
names
of
the
streets
and
all
that
i
remember
of
my
walk
on
that
sunday
afternoon
seems
but
the
broken
fragments
of
an
evil
dream
in
a
confused
vision
i
stumbled
on
through
roads
half
town
and
half
country
gray
fields
melting
into
the
cloudy
world
of
mist
on
one
side
of
me
and
on
the
other
comfortable
villas
with
a
glow
of
firelight
flickering
on
the
walls
but
all
unreal
red
brick
walls
and
lighted
windows
vague
trees
and
glimmering
country
beginning
to
star
the
white
shadows
the
vanishing
perspectives
of
the
railway
line
beneath
high
embankments
the
green
and
red
of
the
signal
lamps
all
these
were
but
momentary
pictures
flashed
on
my
tired
brain
and
senses
numbed
by
hunger
now
and
then
i
would
hear
a
quick
step
ringing
on
the
iron
road
and
men
would
pass
me
well
wrapped
up
walking
fast
for
the
sake
of
warmth
and
no
doubt
eagerly
foretasting
the
pleasures
of
a
glowing
hearth
with
curtains
tightly
drawn
about
the
frosted
panes
and
the
welcomes
of
their
friends
but
as
the
early
evening
darkened
and
night
approached
got
fewer
and
fewer
and
i
passed
through
street
after
street
alone
in
the
white
silence
i
stumbled
on
as
desolate
as
if
i
trod
the
streets
of
a
buried
city
and
as
i
grew
more
weak
and
exhausted
something
of
the
horror
of
death
was
folding
thickly
round
my
heart
suddenly
as
i
turned
a
corner
some
one
accosted
me
courteously
beneath
the
and
i
heard
a
voice
asking
if
i
could
kindly
point
the
way
to
avon
road
at
the
sudden
shock
of
human
accents
i
was
prostrated
and
my
strength
gave
way
and
i
fell
all
huddled
on
the
and
wept
and
sobbed
and
laughed
in
violent
hysteria
i
had
gone
out
prepared
to
die
and
as
i
stepped
across
the
threshold
that
had
sheltered
me
i
consciously
bade
adieu
to
all
hopes
and
all
remembrances
the
door
clanged
behind
me
with
the
noise
of
thunder
and
i
felt
that
an
iron
curtain
had
fallen
on
the
brief
passages
of
my
life
and
that
henceforth
i
was
to
walk
a
little
way
in
a
world
of
gloom
and
shadow
i
entered
on
the
stage
of
the
first
act
of
death
then
came
my
wandering
in
the
mist
the
whiteness
wrapping
all
things
the
void
streets
and
muffled
silence
till
when
that
voice
spoke
to
me
it
was
as
if
i
had
died
and
life
returned
to
me
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
able
to
compose
my
feelings
and
as
i
rose
i
saw
that
i
was
confronted
by
a
gentleman
of
specious
appearance
neatly
and
correctly
dressed
he
looked
at
me
with
an
expression
of
great
pity
but
before
i
could
stammer
out
my
ignorance
of
the
neighborhood
for
indeed
i
had
not
the
slightest
notion
of
where
i
had
wandered
he
spoke
my
dear
madam
he
said
you
seem
in
some
terrible
distress
you
can
not
think
how
you
alarmed
me
but
may
i
inquire
the
nature
of
your
trouble
i
assure
you
that
you
can
safely
confide
in
me
you
are
very
kind
i
replied
but
i
fear
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
my
condition
seems
a
hopeless
one
oh
nonsense
nonsense
you
are
too
young
to
talk
like
that
come
let
us
walk
down
here
and
you
must
tell
me
your
difficulty
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
there
was
something
very
soothing
and
persuasive
in
his
manner
and
as
we
walked
together
i
gave
him
an
outline
of
my
story
and
told
of
the
despair
that
had
oppressed
me
almost
to
death
you
were
wrong
to
give
in
so
completely
he
said
when
i
was
silent
a
month
is
too
short
a
time
in
which
to
feel
one
way
in
london
london
let
me
tell
you
miss
lally
does
not
lie
open
and
undefended
it
is
a
fortified
place
fossed
and
with
curious
intricacies
as
must
always
happen
in
large
towns
the
conditions
of
life
have
become
hugely
artificial
no
mere
simple
palisade
is
run
up
to
oppose
the
man
or
woman
who
would
take
the
place
by
storm
but
serried
lines
of
subtle
contrivances
mines
and
pitfalls
which
it
needs
a
strange
skill
to
overcome
you
in
your
simplicity
fancied
you
had
only
to
shout
for
these
walls
to
sink
into
nothingness
but
the
time
is
gone
for
such
startling
victories
as
these
take
courage
you
will
learn
the
secret
of
success
before
very
long
alas
sir
i
replied
i
have
no
doubt
your
conclusions
are
correct
but
at
the
present
moment
i
seem
to
be
in
a
fair
way
to
die
of
starvation
you
spoke
of
a
secret
for
heaven
sake
tell
it
me
if
you
have
any
pity
for
my
distress
he
laughed
genially
there
lies
the
strangeness
of
it
all
those
who
know
the
secret
can
not
tell
it
if
they
would
it
is
positively
as
ineffable
as
the
central
doctrine
of
freemasonry
but
i
may
say
this
that
you
yourself
have
penetrated
at
least
the
outer
husk
of
the
mystery
and
he
laughed
again
pray
do
not
jest
with
me
i
said
what
have
i
done
i
am
so
far
ignorant
that
i
have
not
the
slightest
idea
of
how
my
next
meal
is
to
be
provided
excuse
me
you
ask
what
you
have
done
you
have
met
me
come
we
will
fence
no
longer
i
see
you
have
the
only
education
which
is
not
infinitely
pernicious
and
i
am
in
want
of
a
governess
for
my
two
children
i
have
been
a
widower
for
some
years
my
name
is
gregg
i
offer
you
the
post
i
have
named
and
shall
we
say
a
salary
of
a
hundred
a
year
i
could
only
stutter
out
my
thanks
and
slipping
a
card
with
his
address
and
a
by
way
of
earnest
into
my
hand
gregg
bade
me
asking
me
to
call
in
a
day
or
two
such
was
my
introduction
to
professor
gregg
and
can
you
wonder
that
the
remembrance
of
despair
and
the
cold
blast
that
had
blown
from
the
gates
of
death
upon
me
made
me
regard
him
as
a
second
father
before
the
close
of
the
week
i
was
installed
in
my
new
duties
the
professor
had
leased
an
old
brick
manor
house
in
a
western
suburb
of
london
and
here
surrounded
by
pleasant
lawns
and
orchards
and
soothed
with
the
murmur
of
the
ancient
elms
that
rocked
their
boughs
above
the
roof
the
new
chapter
of
my
life
began
knowing
as
you
do
the
nature
of
the
professor
occupations
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
that
the
house
teemed
with
books
and
cabinets
full
of
strange
and
even
hideous
objects
filled
every
available
nook
in
the
vast
low
rooms
gregg
was
a
man
whose
one
thought
was
for
knowledge
and
i
too
before
long
caught
something
of
his
enthusiasm
and
strove
to
enter
into
his
passion
for
research
in
a
few
months
i
was
perhaps
more
his
secretary
than
the
governess
of
the
two
children
and
many
a
night
i
have
sat
at
the
desk
in
the
glow
of
the
shaded
lamp
while
he
pacing
up
and
down
in
the
rich
gloom
of
the
firelight
dictated
to
me
the
substance
of
his
of
ethnology
but
amidst
these
more
sober
and
accurate
studies
i
always
detected
a
something
hidden
a
longing
and
desire
for
some
object
to
which
he
did
not
allude
and
now
and
then
he
would
break
short
in
what
he
was
saying
and
lapse
into
revery
entranced
as
it
seemed
to
me
by
some
distant
prospect
of
adventurous
discovery
the
was
at
last
finished
and
we
began
to
receive
proofs
from
the
printers
which
were
intrusted
to
me
for
a
first
reading
and
then
underwent
the
final
revision
of
the
professor
all
the
while
his
weariness
of
the
actual
business
he
was
engaged
on
increased
and
it
was
with
the
joyous
laugh
of
a
schoolboy
when
term
is
over
that
he
one
day
handed
me
a
copy
of
the
book
there
he
said
i
have
kept
my
word
i
promised
to
write
it
and
it
is
done
with
now
i
shall
be
free
to
live
for
stranger
things
i
confess
it
miss
lally
i
covet
the
renown
of
columbus
you
will
i
hope
see
me
play
the
part
of
an
explorer
surely
i
said
there
is
little
left
to
explore
you
have
been
born
a
few
hundred
years
too
late
for
that
i
think
you
are
wrong
he
replied
there
are
still
depend
upon
it
quaint
undiscovered
countries
and
continents
of
strange
extent
ah
miss
lally
believe
me
we
stand
amidst
sacraments
and
mysteries
full
of
awe
and
it
doth
not
yet
appear
what
we
shall
be
life
believe
me
is
no
simple
thing
no
mass
of
gray
matter
and
congeries
of
veins
and
muscles
to
be
laid
naked
by
the
surgeon
knife
man
is
the
secret
which
i
am
about
to
explore
and
before
i
can
discover
him
i
must
cross
over
weltering
seas
indeed
and
oceans
and
the
mists
of
many
thousand
years
you
know
the
myth
of
the
lost
atlantis
what
if
it
be
true
and
i
am
destined
to
be
called
the
discoverer
of
that
wonderful
land
i
could
see
excitement
boiling
beneath
his
words
and
in
his
face
was
the
heat
of
the
hunter
before
me
stood
a
man
who
believed
himself
summoned
to
tourney
with
the
unknown
a
pang
of
joy
possessed
me
when
i
reflected
that
i
was
to
be
in
a
way
associated
with
him
in
the
adventure
and
i
too
burned
with
the
lust
of
the
chase
not
pausing
to
consider
that
i
knew
not
what
we
were
to
unshadow
the
next
morning
professor
gregg
took
me
into
his
inner
study
where
ranged
against
the
wall
stood
a
nest
of
every
drawer
neatly
labelled
and
the
results
of
years
of
toil
classified
in
a
few
feet
of
space
here
he
said
is
my
life
here
are
all
the
facts
which
i
have
gathered
together
with
so
much
pains
and
yet
it
is
all
nothing
no
nothing
to
what
i
am
about
to
attempt
look
at
this
and
he
took
me
to
an
old
bureau
a
piece
fantastic
and
faded
which
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
room
he
unlocked
the
front
and
opened
one
of
the
drawers
a
few
scraps
of
paper
he
went
on
pointing
to
the
drawer
and
a
lump
of
black
stone
rudely
annotated
with
queer
marks
and
scratches
that
is
all
that
drawer
holds
here
you
see
is
an
old
envelope
with
the
dark
red
stamp
of
twenty
years
ago
but
i
have
pencilled
a
few
lines
at
the
back
here
is
a
sheet
of
manuscript
and
here
some
cuttings
from
obscure
local
journals
and
if
you
ask
me
the
subject
matter
of
the
collection
it
will
not
seem
extraordinary
a
servant
girl
at
a
farmhouse
who
disappeared
from
her
place
and
has
never
been
heard
of
a
child
supposed
to
have
slipped
down
some
old
working
on
the
mountains
some
queer
scribbling
on
a
limestone
rock
a
man
murdered
with
a
blow
from
a
strange
weapon
such
is
the
scent
i
have
to
go
upon
yes
as
you
say
there
is
a
ready
explanation
for
all
this
the
girl
may
have
run
away
to
london
or
liverpool
or
new
york
the
child
may
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
disused
shaft
and
the
letters
on
the
rock
may
be
the
idle
whims
of
some
vagrant
yes
yes
i
admit
all
that
but
i
know
i
hold
the
true
key
look
and
he
held
me
out
a
slip
of
yellow
paper
characters
found
inscribed
on
a
limestone
rock
on
the
gray
hills
i
read
and
then
there
was
a
word
erased
presumably
the
name
of
a
county
and
a
date
some
fifteen
years
back
beneath
was
traced
a
number
of
uncouth
characters
shaped
somewhat
like
wedges
or
daggers
as
strange
and
outlandish
as
the
hebrew
alphabet
now
the
seal
said
professor
gregg
and
he
handed
me
the
black
stone
a
thing
about
two
inches
long
and
something
like
an
tobacco
stopper
much
enlarged
i
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
saw
to
my
surprise
the
characters
on
the
paper
repeated
on
the
seal
yes
said
the
professor
they
are
the
same
and
the
marks
on
the
limestone
rock
were
made
fifteen
years
ago
with
some
red
substance
and
the
characters
on
the
seal
are
four
thousand
years
old
at
least
perhaps
much
more
is
it
a
hoax
i
said
no
i
anticipated
that
i
was
not
to
be
led
to
give
my
life
to
a
practical
joke
i
have
tested
the
matter
very
carefully
only
one
person
besides
myself
knows
of
the
mere
existence
of
that
black
seal
besides
there
are
other
reasons
which
i
can
not
enter
into
now
but
what
does
it
all
mean
i
said
i
can
not
understand
to
what
conclusion
all
this
leads
my
dear
miss
lally
that
is
a
question
i
would
rather
leave
unanswered
for
some
little
time
perhaps
i
shall
never
be
able
to
say
what
secrets
are
held
here
in
solution
a
few
vague
hints
the
outlines
of
village
tragedies
a
few
marks
done
with
red
earth
upon
a
rock
and
an
ancient
seal
a
queer
set
of
data
to
go
upon
pieces
of
evidence
and
twenty
years
before
even
so
much
could
be
got
together
and
who
knows
what
mirage
or
terra
incognita
may
be
beyond
all
this
i
look
across
deep
waters
miss
lally
and
the
land
beyond
may
be
but
a
haze
after
all
but
still
i
believe
it
is
not
so
and
a
few
months
will
show
whether
i
am
right
or
wrong
he
left
me
and
alone
i
endeavored
to
fathom
the
mystery
wondering
to
what
goal
such
eccentric
odds
and
ends
of
evidence
could
lead
i
myself
am
not
wholly
devoid
of
imagination
and
i
had
reason
to
respect
the
professor
solidity
of
intellect
yet
i
saw
in
the
contents
of
the
drawer
but
the
materials
of
fantasy
and
vainly
tried
to
conceive
what
theory
could
be
founded
on
the
fragments
that
had
been
placed
before
me
indeed
i
could
discover
in
what
i
had
heard
and
seen
but
the
first
chapter
of
an
extravagant
romance
and
yet
deep
in
my
heart
i
burned
with
curiosity
and
day
after
day
i
looked
eagerly
in
professor
face
for
some
hint
of
what
was
to
happen
it
was
one
evening
after
dinner
that
the
word
came
i
hope
you
can
make
your
preparations
without
much
trouble
he
said
suddenly
to
me
we
shall
be
leaving
here
in
a
week
time
really
i
said
in
astonishment
where
are
we
going
i
have
taken
a
country
house
in
the
west
of
england
not
far
from
caermaen
a
quiet
little
town
once
a
city
and
the
headquarters
of
a
roman
legion
it
is
very
dull
there
but
the
country
is
pretty
and
the
air
is
wholesome
i
detected
a
glint
in
his
eyes
and
guessed
that
this
sudden
move
had
some
relation
to
our
conversation
of
a
few
days
before
i
shall
just
take
a
few
books
with
me
said
professor
gregg
that
is
all
everything
else
will
remain
here
for
our
return
i
have
got
a
holiday
he
went
on
smiling
at
me
and
i
sha
be
sorry
to
be
quit
for
a
time
of
my
old
bones
and
stones
and
rubbish
do
you
know
he
went
on
i
have
been
grinding
away
at
facts
for
thirty
years
it
is
time
for
fancies
the
days
passed
quickly
i
could
see
that
the
professor
was
all
quivering
with
suppressed
excitement
and
i
could
scarce
credit
the
eager
appetence
of
his
glance
as
we
left
the
old
manor
house
behind
us
and
began
our
journey
we
set
out
at
and
it
was
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
that
we
arrived
at
a
little
country
station
i
was
tired
and
excited
and
the
drive
through
the
lanes
seems
all
a
dream
first
the
deserted
streets
of
a
forgotten
village
while
i
heard
professor
gregg
voice
talking
of
the
augustan
legion
and
the
clash
of
arms
and
all
the
tremendous
pomp
that
followed
the
eagles
then
the
broad
river
swimming
to
full
tide
with
the
last
afterglow
glimmering
duskily
in
the
yellow
water
the
wide
meadows
and
the
cornfields
whitening
and
the
deep
lane
winding
on
the
slope
between
the
hills
and
the
water
at
last
we
began
to
ascend
and
the
air
grew
rarer
i
looked
down
and
saw
the
pure
white
mist
tracking
the
outline
of
the
river
like
a
shroud
and
a
vague
and
shadowy
country
imaginations
and
fantasy
of
swelling
hills
and
hanging
woods
and
outlines
of
hills
beyond
stand
in
the
distance
the
glare
of
the
furnace
fire
on
the
mountain
growing
by
turns
a
pillar
of
shining
flame
and
fading
to
a
dull
point
of
red
we
were
slowly
mounting
a
carriage
drive
and
then
there
came
to
me
the
cool
breath
and
the
scent
of
the
great
wood
that
was
above
us
i
seemed
to
wander
in
its
deepest
depths
and
there
was
the
sound
of
trickling
water
the
scent
of
the
green
leaves
and
the
breath
of
the
summer
night
the
carriage
stopped
at
last
and
i
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
form
of
the
house
as
i
waited
a
moment
at
the
pillared
porch
and
the
rest
of
the
evening
seemed
a
dream
of
strange
things
bounded
by
the
great
silence
of
the
wood
and
the
valley
and
the
river
the
next
morning
when
i
awoke
and
looked
out
of
the
bow
window
of
the
big
bedroom
i
saw
under
a
gray
sky
a
country
that
was
still
all
mystery
the
long
lovely
valley
with
the
river
winding
in
and
out
below
crossed
in
mid
vision
by
a
mediæval
bridge
of
vaulted
and
buttressed
stone
the
clear
presence
of
the
rising
ground
beyond
and
the
woods
that
i
had
only
seen
in
shadow
the
night
before
seemed
tinged
with
enchantment
and
the
soft
breath
of
air
that
sighed
in
at
the
opened
pane
was
like
no
other
wind
i
looked
across
the
valley
and
beyond
hill
followed
on
hill
as
wave
on
wave
and
here
a
faint
blue
pillar
of
smoke
rose
still
in
the
morning
air
from
the
chimney
of
an
ancient
gray
farmhouse
there
was
a
rugged
height
crowned
with
dark
firs
and
in
the
distance
i
saw
the
white
streak
of
a
road
that
climbed
and
vanished
into
some
unimagined
country
but
the
boundary
of
all
was
a
great
wall
of
mountain
vast
in
the
west
and
ending
like
a
fortress
with
a
steep
ascent
and
a
domed
tumulus
clear
against
the
sky
i
saw
professor
gregg
walking
up
and
down
the
terrace
path
below
the
windows
and
it
was
evident
that
he
was
revelling
in
the
sense
of
liberty
and
the
thought
that
he
had
for
a
while
bidden
to
when
i
joined
him
there
was
exultation
in
his
voice
as
he
pointed
out
the
sweep
of
valley
and
the
river
that
wound
beneath
the
lovely
hills
yes
he
said
it
is
a
strangely
beautiful
country
and
to
me
at
least
it
seems
full
of
mystery
you
have
not
forgotten
the
drawer
i
showed
you
miss
lally
no
and
you
have
guessed
that
i
have
come
here
not
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
children
and
the
fresh
air
i
think
i
have
guessed
as
much
as
that
i
replied
but
you
must
remember
i
do
not
know
the
mere
nature
of
your
investigations
and
as
for
the
connection
between
the
search
and
this
wonderful
valley
it
is
past
my
guessing
he
smiled
queerly
at
me
you
must
not
think
i
am
making
a
mystery
for
the
sake
of
mystery
he
said
i
do
not
speak
out
because
so
far
there
is
nothing
to
be
spoken
nothing
definite
i
mean
nothing
that
can
be
set
down
in
hard
black
and
white
as
dull
and
sure
and
irreproachable
as
any
blue
book
and
then
i
have
another
reason
many
years
ago
a
chance
paragraph
in
a
newspaper
caught
my
attention
and
focussed
in
an
instant
the
vagrant
thoughts
and
fancies
of
many
idle
and
speculative
hours
into
a
certain
hypothesis
i
saw
at
once
that
i
was
treading
on
a
thin
crust
my
theory
was
wild
and
fantastic
in
the
extreme
and
i
would
not
for
any
consideration
have
written
a
hint
of
it
for
publication
but
i
thought
that
in
the
company
of
scientific
men
like
myself
men
who
knew
the
course
of
discovery
and
were
aware
that
the
gas
that
blazes
and
flares
in
the
was
once
a
wild
hypothesis
i
thought
that
with
such
men
as
these
i
might
hazard
my
dream
let
us
say
atlantis
or
the
philosopher
stone
or
what
you
like
without
danger
of
ridicule
i
found
i
was
grossly
mistaken
my
friends
looked
blankly
at
me
and
at
one
another
and
i
could
see
something
of
pity
and
something
also
of
insolent
contempt
in
the
glances
they
exchanged
one
of
them
called
on
me
next
day
and
hinted
that
i
must
be
suffering
from
overwork
and
brain
exhaustion
plain
terms
i
said
think
i
am
going
mad
i
think
not
and
i
showed
him
out
with
some
little
appearance
of
heat
since
that
day
i
vowed
that
i
would
never
whisper
the
nature
of
my
theory
to
any
living
soul
to
no
one
but
yourself
have
i
ever
shown
the
contents
of
that
drawer
after
all
i
may
be
following
a
rainbow
i
may
have
been
misled
by
the
play
of
coincidence
but
as
i
stand
here
in
this
mystic
hush
and
silence
amidst
the
woods
and
wild
hills
i
am
more
than
ever
sure
that
i
am
hot
on
the
scent
come
it
is
time
we
went
in
to
me
in
all
this
there
was
something
both
of
wonder
and
excitement
i
knew
how
in
his
ordinary
work
professor
gregg
moved
step
by
step
testing
every
inch
of
the
way
and
never
venturing
on
assertion
without
proof
that
was
impregnable
yet
i
divined
more
from
his
glance
and
the
vehemence
of
his
tone
than
from
the
spoken
word
that
he
had
in
his
every
thought
the
vision
of
the
almost
incredible
continually
with
him
and
i
who
was
with
some
share
of
imagination
no
little
of
a
sceptic
offended
at
a
hint
of
the
marvellous
could
not
help
asking
myself
whether
he
was
cherishing
a
monomania
and
barring
out
from
this
one
subject
all
the
scientific
method
of
his
other
life
yet
with
this
image
of
mystery
haunting
my
thoughts
i
surrendered
wholly
to
the
charm
of
the
country
above
the
faded
house
on
the
hillside
began
the
great
forest
a
long
dark
line
seen
from
the
opposing
hills
stretching
above
the
river
for
many
a
mile
from
north
to
south
and
yielding
in
the
north
to
even
wilder
country
barren
and
savage
hills
and
ragged
common
land
a
territory
all
strange
and
unvisited
and
more
unknown
to
englishmen
than
the
very
heart
of
africa
the
space
of
a
couple
of
steep
fields
alone
separated
the
house
from
the
wood
and
the
children
were
delighted
to
follow
me
up
the
long
alleys
of
undergrowth
between
smooth
pleached
walls
of
shining
beech
to
the
highest
point
in
the
wood
whence
one
looked
on
one
side
across
the
river
and
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
country
to
the
great
western
mountain
wall
and
on
the
other
over
the
surge
and
dip
of
the
myriad
trees
of
the
forest
over
level
meadows
and
the
shining
yellow
sea
to
the
faint
coast
beyond
i
used
to
sit
at
this
point
on
the
warm
sunlit
turf
which
marked
the
track
of
the
roman
road
while
the
two
children
raced
about
hunting
for
the
whinberries
that
grew
here
and
there
on
the
banks
here
beneath
the
deep
blue
sky
and
the
great
clouds
rolling
like
olden
galleons
with
sails
from
the
sea
to
the
hills
as
i
listened
to
the
whispered
charm
of
the
great
and
ancient
wood
i
lived
solely
for
delight
and
only
remembered
strange
things
when
we
would
return
to
the
house
and
find
professor
gregg
either
shut
up
in
the
little
room
he
had
made
his
study
or
else
pacing
the
terrace
with
the
look
patient
and
enthusiastic
of
the
determined
seeker
one
morning
some
eight
or
nine
days
after
our
arrival
i
looked
out
of
my
window
and
saw
the
whole
landscape
transmuted
before
me
the
clouds
had
dipped
low
and
hidden
the
mountain
in
the
west
and
a
southern
wind
was
driving
the
rain
in
shifting
pillars
up
the
valley
and
the
little
brooklet
that
burst
the
hill
below
the
house
now
raged
a
red
torrent
down
to
the
river
we
were
perforce
obliged
to
keep
snug
within
doors
and
when
i
had
attended
to
my
pupils
i
sat
down
in
the
where
the
ruins
of
a
library
still
encumbered
an
bookcase
i
had
inspected
the
shelves
once
or
twice
but
their
contents
had
failed
to
attract
me
volumes
of
eighteenth
century
sermons
an
old
book
on
farriery
a
collection
of
poems
by
persons
of
quality
connection
and
an
odd
volume
of
pope
were
the
boundaries
of
the
library
and
there
seemed
little
doubt
that
everything
of
interest
or
value
had
been
removed
now
however
in
desperation
i
began
to
the
musty
sheepskin
and
calf
bindings
and
found
much
to
my
delight
a
fine
old
quarto
printed
by
the
stephani
containing
the
three
books
of
pomponius
mela
de
situ
orbis
and
other
of
the
ancient
geographers
i
knew
enough
of
latin
to
steer
my
way
through
an
ordinary
sentence
and
i
soon
became
absorbed
in
the
odd
mixture
of
fact
and
fancy
light
shining
on
a
little
of
the
space
of
the
world
and
beyond
mist
and
shadow
and
awful
forms
glancing
over
the
pages
my
attention
was
caught
by
the
heading
of
a
chapter
in
solinus
and
i
read
the
words
mira
de
intimis
gentibus
libyae
de
lapide
hexecontalitho
the
wonders
of
the
people
that
inhabit
the
inner
parts
of
libya
and
of
the
stone
called
sixtystone
the
odd
title
attracted
me
and
i
read
on
gens
ista
avia
et
secreta
habitat
in
montibus
horrendis
foeda
mysteria
celebrat
de
hominibus
nihil
aliud

quam
figuram

quam

this
folk
i
translated
to
myself
dwells
in
remote
and
secret
places
and
celebrates
foul
mysteries
on
savage
hills
nothing
have
they
in
common
with
men
save
the
face
and
the
customs
of
humanity
are
wholly
strange
to
them
and
they
hate
the
sun
they
hiss
rather
than
speak
their
voices
are
harsh
and
not
to
be
heard
without
fear
they
boast
of
a
certain
stone
which
they
call
sixtystone
for
they
say
that
it
displays
sixty
characters
and
this
stone
has
a
secret
unspeakable
name
which
is
ixaxar
i
laughed
at
the
queer
inconsequence
of
all
this
and
thought
it
fit
for
sinbad
the
sailor
or
other
of
the
supplementary
nights
when
i
saw
professor
gregg
in
the
course
of
the
day
i
told
him
of
my
find
in
the
bookcase
and
the
fantastic
rubbish
i
had
been
reading
to
my
surprise
he
looked
up
at
me
with
an
expression
of
great
interest
that
is
really
very
curious
he
said
i
have
never
thought
it
worth
while
to
look
into
the
old
geographers
and
i
daresay
i
have
missed
a
good
deal
ah
that
is
the
passage
is
it
it
seems
a
shame
to
rob
you
of
your
entertainment
but
i
really
think
i
must
carry
off
the
book
the
next
day
the
professor
called
to
me
to
come
to
the
study
i
found
him
sitting
at
a
table
in
the
full
light
of
the
window
scrutinizing
something
very
attentively
with
a
ah
miss
lally
he
began
i
want
to
use
your
eyes
this
glass
is
pretty
good
but
not
like
my
old
one
that
i
left
in
town
would
you
mind
examining
the
thing
yourself
and
telling
me
how
many
characters
are
cut
on
it
he
handed
me
the
object
in
his
hand
and
i
saw
that
it
was
the
black
seal
he
had
shown
me
in
london
and
my
heart
began
to
beat
with
the
thought
that
i
was
presently
to
know
something
i
took
the
seal
and
holding
it
up
to
the
light
checked
off
the
grotesque
characters
one
by
one
i
make
i
said
at
last
nonsense
it
impossible
ah
i
see
what
you
have
done
you
have
counted
that
and
that
and
he
pointed
to
two
marks
which
i
had
certainly
taken
as
letters
with
the
rest
yes
yes
professor
gregg
went
on
but
those
are
obvious
scratches
done
accidentally
i
saw
that
at
once
yes
then
that
quite
right
thank
you
very
much
miss
lally
i
was
going
away
rather
disappointed
at
my
having
been
called
in
merely
to
count
a
number
of
marks
on
the
black
seal
when
suddenly
there
flashed
into
my
mind
what
i
had
read
in
the
morning
but
professor
gregg
i
cried
breathless
the
seal
the
seal
why
it
is
the
stone
hexecontalithos
that
solinus
writes
of
it
is
ixaxar
yes
he
said
i
suppose
it
is
or
it
maybe
a
mere
coincidence
it
never
does
to
be
too
sure
you
know
in
these
matters
coincidence
killed
the
professor
i
went
away
puzzled
by
what
i
had
heard
and
as
much
as
ever
at
a
loss
to
find
the
ruling
clew
in
this
maze
of
strange
evidence
for
three
days
the
bad
weather
lasted
changing
from
driving
rain
to
a
dense
mist
fine
and
dripping
and
we
seemed
to
be
shut
up
in
a
white
cloud
that
veiled
all
the
world
away
from
us
all
the
while
professor
gregg
was
darkling
in
his
room
unwilling
it
appeared
to
dispense
confidences
or
talk
of
any
kind
and
i
heard
him
walking
to
and
fro
with
a
quick
impatient
step
as
if
he
were
in
some
way
wearied
of
inaction
the
fourth
morning
was
fine
and
at
breakfast
the
professor
said
briskly
we
want
some
extra
help
about
the
house
a
boy
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
you
know
there
are
a
lot
of
little
odd
jobs
that
take
up
the
time
which
a
boy
could
do
much
better
the
girls
have
not
complained
to
me
in
any
way
i
replied
indeed
anne
said
there
was
much
less
work
than
in
london
owing
to
there
being
so
little
dust
ah
yes
they
are
very
good
girls
but
i
think
we
shall
do
much
better
with
a
boy
in
fact
that
is
what
has
been
bothering
me
for
the
last
two
days
bothering
you
i
said
in
astonishment
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
professor
never
took
the
slightest
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
house
yes
he
said
the
weather
you
know
i
really
could
go
out
in
that
scotch
mist
i
do
know
the
country
very
well
and
i
should
have
lost
my
way
but
i
am
going
to
get
the
boy
this
morning
but
how
do
you
know
there
is
such
a
boy
as
you
want
anywhere
about
oh
i
have
no
doubt
as
to
that
i
may
have
to
walk
a
mile
or
two
at
the
most
but
i
am
sure
to
find
just
the
boy
i
require
i
thought
the
professor
was
poking
but
though
his
tone
was
airy
enough
there
was
something
grim
and
set
about
his
features
that
puzzled
me
he
got
his
stick
and
stood
at
the
door
looking
meditatively
before
him
and
as
i
passed
through
the
hall
he
called
to
me
by
the
way
miss
lally
there
was
one
thing
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
i
daresay
you
may
have
heard
that
some
of
these
country
lads
are
not
over
bright
idiotic
would
be
a
harsh
word
to
use
and
they
are
usually
called
or
something
of
the
kind
i
hope
you
wo
mind
if
the
boy
i
am
after
should
turn
out
not
too
he
will
be
perfectly
harmless
of
course
and
blacking
boots
does
need
much
mental
effort
with
that
he
was
gone
striding
up
the
road
that
led
to
the
wood
and
i
remained
stupefied
and
then
for
the
first
time
my
astonishment
was
mingled
with
a
sudden
note
of
terror
arising
i
knew
not
whence
and
all
unexplained
even
to
myself
and
yet
i
felt
about
my
heart
for
an
instant
something
of
the
chill
of
death
and
that
shapeless
formless
dread
of
the
unknown
that
is
worse
than
death
itself
i
tried
to
find
courage
in
the
sweet
air
that
blew
up
from
the
sea
and
in
the
sunlight
after
rain
but
the
mystic
woods
seemed
to
darken
around
me
and
the
vision
of
the
river
coiling
between
the
reeds
and
the
silver
gray
of
the
ancient
bridge
fashioned
in
my
mind
symbols
of
vague
dread
as
the
mind
of
a
child
fashions
terror
from
things
harmless
and
familiar
two
hours
later
professor
gregg
returned
i
met
him
as
he
came
down
the
road
and
asked
quietly
if
he
had
been
able
to
find
a
boy
oh
yes
he
answered
i
found
one
easily
enough
his
name
is
jervase
cradock
and
i
expect
he
will
make
himself
very
useful
his
father
has
been
dead
for
many
years
and
the
mother
whom
i
saw
seemed
very
glad
at
the
prospect
of
a
few
shillings
extra
coming
in
on
saturday
nights
as
i
expected
he
is
not
too
sharp
has
fits
at
times
the
mother
said
but
as
he
will
not
be
trusted
with
the
china
that
does
much
matter
does
it
and
he
is
not
in
any
way
dangerous
you
know
merely
a
little
weak
when
is
he
coming
morning
at
eight
anne
will
show
him
what
he
has
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
at
first
he
will
go
home
every
night
but
perhaps
it
may
ultimately
turn
out
more
convenient
for
him
to
sleep
here
and
only
go
home
for
sundays
i
found
nothing
to
say
to
all
this
professor
gregg
spoke
in
a
quiet
tone
of
as
indeed
was
warranted
by
the
circumstance
and
yet
i
could
not
quell
my
sensation
of
astonishment
at
the
whole
affair
i
knew
that
in
reality
no
assistance
was
wanted
in
the
housework
and
the
professor
prediction
that
the
boy
he
was
to
engage
might
prove
a
little
simple
followed
by
so
exact
a
fulfilment
struck
me
as
bizarre
in
the
extreme
the
next
morning
i
heard
from
the
housemaid
that
the
boy
cradock
had
come
at
eight
and
that
she
had
been
trying
to
make
him
useful
he
does
seem
quite
all
there
i
do
think
miss
was
her
comment
and
later
in
the
day
i
saw
him
helping
the
old
man
who
worked
in
the
garden
he
was
a
youth
of
about
fourteen
with
black
hair
and
black
eyes
and
an
olive
skin
and
i
saw
at
once
from
the
curious
vacancy
of
his
expression
that
he
was
mentally
weak
he
touched
his
forehead
awkwardly
as
i
went
by
and
i
heard
him
answering
the
gardener
in
a
queer
harsh
voice
that
caught
my
attention
it
gave
me
the
impression
of
some
one
speaking
deep
below
under
the
earth
and
there
was
a
strange
sibilance
like
the
hissing
of
the
phonograph
as
the
pointer
travels
over
the
cylinder
i
heard
that
he
seemed
anxious
to
do
what
he
could
and
was
quite
docile
and
obedient
and
morgan
the
gardener
who
knew
his
mother
assured
me
he
was
perfectly
harmless
he
always
been
a
bit
queer
he
said
and
no
wonder
after
what
his
mother
went
through
before
he
was
born
i
did
know
his
father
thomas
cradock
well
and
a
very
fine
workman
he
was
too
indeed
he
got
something
wrong
with
his
lungs
owing
to
working
in
the
wet
woods
and
never
got
over
it
and
went
off
quite
sudden
like
and
they
do
say
as
how
cradock
was
quite
off
her
head
anyhow
she
was
found
by
hillyer
ty
coch
all
crouched
up
on
the
gray
hills
over
there
crying
and
weeping
like
a
lost
soul
and
jervase
he
was
born
about
eight
months
afterwards
and
as
i
was
saying
he
was
a
bit
queer
always
and
they
do
say
when
he
could
scarcely
walk
he
would
frighten
the
other
children
into
fits
with
the
noises
he
would
make
a
word
in
the
story
had
stirred
up
some
remembrance
within
me
and
vaguely
curious
i
asked
the
old
man
where
the
gray
hills
were
up
there
he
said
with
the
same
gesture
he
had
used
before
you
go
past
the
fox
and
hounds
and
through
the
forest
by
the
old
ruins
a
good
five
mile
from
here
and
a
strange
sort
of
a
place
the
poorest
soil
between
this
and
monmouth
they
do
say
though
it
good
feed
for
sheep
yes
it
was
a
sad
thing
for
poor
mrs
cradock
the
old
man
turned
to
his
work
and
i
strolled
on
down
the
path
between
the
espaliers
gnarled
and
gouty
with
age
thinking
of
the
story
i
had
heard
and
groping
for
the
point
in
it
that
had
some
key
to
my
memory
in
an
instant
it
came
before
me
i
had
seen
the
phrase
gray
hills
on
the
slip
of
yellowed
paper
that
professor
gregg
had
taken
from
the
drawer
in
his
cabinet
again
i
was
seized
with
pangs
of
mingled
curiosity
and
fear
i
remembered
the
strange
characters
copied
from
the
limestone
rock
and
then
again
their
identity
with
the
inscription
on
the
seal
and
the
fantastic
fables
of
the
latin
geographer
i
saw
beyond
doubt
that
unless
coincidence
had
set
all
the
scene
and
disposed
all
these
bizarre
events
with
curious
art
i
was
to
be
a
spectator
of
things
far
removed
from
the
usual
and
customary
traffic
and
jostle
of
life
professor
gregg
i
noted
day
by
day
he
was
hot
on
his
trail
growing
lean
with
eagerness
and
in
the
evenings
when
the
sun
was
swimming
on
the
verge
of
the
mountain
he
would
pace
the
terrace
to
and
fro
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
while
the
mist
grew
white
in
the
valley
and
the
stillness
of
the
evening
brought
far
voices
near
and
the
blue
smoke
rose
a
straight
column
from
the
chimney
of
the
gray
farmhouse
just
as
i
had
seen
it
on
the
first
morning
i
have
told
you
i
was
of
sceptical
habit
but
though
i
understood
little
or
nothing
i
began
to
dread
vainly
proposing
to
myself
the
iterated
dogmas
of
science
that
all
life
is
material
and
that
in
the
system
of
things
there
is
no
undiscovered
land
even
beyond
the
remotest
stars
where
the
supernatural
can
find
a
footing
yet
there
struck
in
on
this
the
thought
that
matter
is
as
really
awful
and
unknown
as
spirit
that
science
itself
but
dallies
on
the
threshold
scarcely
gaining
more
than
a
glimpse
of
the
wonders
of
the
inner
place
there
is
one
day
that
stands
up
from
amidst
the
others
as
a
grim
red
beacon
betokening
evil
to
come
i
was
sitting
on
a
bench
in
the
garden
watching
the
boy
cradock
weeding
when
i
was
suddenly
alarmed
by
a
harsh
and
choking
sound
like
the
cry
of
a
wild
beast
in
anguish
and
i
was
unspeakably
shocked
to
see
the
unfortunate
lad
standing
in
full
view
before
me
his
whole
body
quivering
and
shaking
at
short
intervals
as
though
shocks
of
electricity
were
passing
through
him
and
his
teeth
grinding
and
foam
gathering
on
his
lips
and
his
face
all
swollen
and
blackened
to
a
hideous
mask
of
humanity
i
shrieked
with
terror
and
professor
gregg
came
running
and
as
i
pointed
to
cradock
the
boy
with
one
convulsive
shudder
fell
face
forward
and
lay
on
the
wet
earth
his
body
writhing
like
a
wounded
and
an
inconceivable
babble
of
sounds
bursting
and
rattling
and
hissing
from
his
lips
he
seemed
to
pour
forth
an
infamous
jargon
with
words
or
what
seemed
words
that
might
have
belonged
to
a
tongue
dead
since
untold
ages
and
buried
deep
beneath
nilotic
mud
or
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
mexican
forest
for
a
moment
the
thought
passed
through
my
mind
as
my
ears
were
still
revolted
with
that
infernal
clamor
surely
this
is
the
very
speech
of
hell
and
then
i
cried
out
again
and
again
and
ran
away
shuddering
to
my
inmost
soul
i
had
seen
professor
gregg
face
as
he
stooped
over
the
wretched
boy
and
raised
him
and
i
was
appalled
by
the
glow
of
exultation
that
shone
on
every
lineament
and
feature
as
i
sat
in
my
room
with
drawn
blinds
and
my
eyes
hidden
in
my
hands
i
heard
heavy
steps
beneath
and
i
was
told
afterwards
that
professor
gregg
had
carried
cradock
to
his
study
and
had
locked
the
door
i
heard
voices
murmur
indistinctly
and
i
trembled
to
think
of
what
might
be
passing
within
a
few
feet
of
where
i
sat
i
longed
to
escape
to
the
woods
and
sunshine
and
yet
i
dreaded
the
sights
that
might
confront
me
on
the
way
and
at
last
as
i
held
the
handle
of
the
door
nervously
i
heard
professor
gregg
voice
calling
to
me
with
a
cheerful
ring
it
all
right
now
miss
lally
he
said
the
poor
fellow
has
got
over
it
and
i
have
been
arranging
for
him
to
sleep
here
after
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
do
something
for
him
yes
he
said
later
it
was
a
very
painful
sight
and
i
do
wonder
you
were
alarmed
we
may
hope
that
good
food
will
build
him
up
a
little
but
i
am
afraid
he
will
never
be
really
cured
and
he
affected
the
dismal
and
conventional
air
with
which
one
speaks
of
hopeless
illness
and
yet
beneath
it
i
detected
the
delight
that
leapt
up
rampant
within
him
and
fought
and
struggled
to
find
utterance
it
was
as
if
one
glanced
down
on
the
even
surface
of
the
sea
clear
and
immobile
and
saw
beneath
raging
depths
and
a
storm
of
contending
billows
it
was
indeed
to
me
a
torturing
and
offensive
problem
that
this
man
who
had
so
bounteously
rescued
me
from
the
sharpness
of
death
and
showed
himself
in
all
the
relations
of
life
full
of
benevolence
and
pity
and
kindly
forethought
should
so
manifestly
be
for
once
on
the
side
of
the
demons
and
take
a
ghastly
pleasure
in
the
torments
of
an
afflicted
apart
i
struggled
with
the
horned
difficulty
and
strove
to
find
the
solution
but
without
the
hint
of
a
clue
beset
by
mystery
and
contradiction
i
saw
nothing
that
might
help
me
and
began
to
wonder
whether
after
all
i
had
not
escaped
from
the
white
mist
of
the
suburb
at
too
dear
a
rate
i
hinted
something
of
my
thought
to
the
professor
i
said
enough
to
let
him
know
that
i
was
in
the
most
acute
perplexity
but
the
moment
after
regretted
what
i
had
done
when
i
saw
his
face
contort
with
a
spasm
of
pain
my
dear
miss
lally
he
said
you
surely
do
not
wish
to
leave
us
no
no
you
would
not
do
it
you
do
not
know
how
i
rely
on
you
how
confidently
i
go
forward
assured
that
you
are
here
to
watch
over
my
children
you
miss
lally
are
my
for
let
me
tell
you
that
the
business
in
which
i
am
engaged
is
not
wholly
devoid
of
peril
you
have
not
forgotten
what
i
said
the
first
morning
here
my
lips
are
shut
by
an
old
and
firm
resolve
till
they
can
open
to
utter
no
ingenious
hypothesis
or
vague
surmise
but
irrefragable
fact
as
certain
as
a
demonstration
in
mathematics
think
over
it
miss
lally
not
for
a
moment
would
i
endeavor
to
keep
you
here
against
your
own
instincts
and
yet
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
am
persuaded
that
it
is
here
here
amidst
the
woods
that
your
duty
lies
i
was
touched
by
the
eloquence
of
his
tone
and
by
the
remembrance
that
the
man
after
all
had
been
my
salvation
and
i
gave
him
my
hand
on
a
promise
to
serve
him
loyally
and
without
question
a
few
days
later
the
rector
of
our
church
a
little
church
gray
and
severe
and
quaint
that
hovered
on
the
very
banks
of
the
river
and
watched
the
tides
swim
and
return
came
to
see
us
and
professor
gregg
easily
persuaded
him
to
stay
and
share
our
dinner
meyrick
was
a
member
of
an
antique
family
of
squires
whose
old
manor
house
stood
amongst
the
hills
some
seven
miles
away
and
thus
rooted
in
the
soil
the
rector
was
a
living
store
of
all
the
old
fading
customs
and
lore
of
the
country
his
manner
genial
with
a
deal
of
retired
oddity
won
on
professor
gregg
and
towards
the
cheese
when
a
curious
burgundy
had
begun
its
incantations
the
two
men
glowed
like
the
wine
and
talked
of
philology
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
burgess
over
the
peerage
the
parson
was
expounding
the
pronunciation
of
the
welsh
and
producing
sounds
like
the
gurgle
of
his
native
brooks
when
professor
gregg
struck
in
by
the
way
he
said
that
was
a
very
odd
word
i
met
with
the
other
day
you
know
my
boy
poor
jervase
cradock
well
he
has
got
the
bad
habit
of
talking
to
himself
and
the
day
before
yesterday
i
was
walking
in
the
garden
here
and
heard
him
he
was
evidently
quite
unconscious
of
my
presence
a
lot
of
what
he
said
i
could
make
out
but
one
word
struck
me
distinctly
it
was
such
an
odd
sound
and
as
quaint
as
those
double
you
have
been
demonstrating
i
do
not
know
whether
i
can
give
you
an
idea
of
the
sound
ishakshar
is
perhaps
as
near
as
i
can
get
but
the
ought
to
be
a
greek
or
a
spanish
now
what
does
it
mean
in
welsh
in
welsh
said
the
parson
there
is
no
such
word
in
welsh
nor
any
word
remotely
resembling
it
i
know
the
as
they
call
it
and
the
colloquial
dialects
as
well
as
any
man
but
there
no
word
like
that
from
anglesea
to
usk
besides
none
of
the
cradocks
speak
a
word
of
welsh
it
dying
out
about
here
really
you
interest
me
extremely
meyrick
i
confess
the
word
did
strike
me
as
having
the
welsh
ring
but
i
thought
it
might
be
some
local
corruption
no
i
never
heard
such
a
word
or
anything
like
it
indeed
he
added
smiling
whimsically
if
it
belongs
to
any
language
i
should
say
it
must
be
that
of
the
fairies
the
tylwydd
têg
as
we
call
them
the
talk
went
on
to
the
discovery
of
a
roman
villa
in
the
neighborhood
and
soon
after
i
left
the
room
and
sat
down
apart
to
wonder
at
the
drawing
together
of
such
strange
clues
of
evidence
as
the
professor
had
spoken
of
the
curious
word
i
had
caught
the
glint
of
his
eye
upon
me
and
though
the
pronunciation
he
gave
was
grotesque
in
the
extreme
i
recognized
the
name
of
the
stone
of
sixty
characters
mentioned
by
solinus
the
black
seal
shut
up
in
some
secret
drawer
of
the
study
stamped
forever
by
a
vanished
race
with
signs
that
no
man
could
read
signs
that
might
for
all
i
knew
be
the
veils
of
awful
things
done
long
ago
and
forgotten
before
the
hills
were
moulded
into
form
when
the
next
morning
i
came
down
i
found
professor
gregg
pacing
the
terrace
in
his
eternal
walk
look
at
that
bridge
he
said
when
he
saw
me
observe
the
quaint
and
gothic
design
the
angles
between
the
arches
and
the
silvery
gray
of
the
stone
in
the
awe
of
the
morning
light
i
confess
it
seems
to
me
symbolic
it
should
illustrate
a
mystical
allegory
of
the
passage
from
one
world
to
another
professor
gregg
i
said
quietly
it
is
time
that
i
knew
something
of
what
has
happened
and
of
what
is
to
happen
for
the
moment
he
put
me
off
but
i
returned
again
with
the
same
question
in
the
evening
and
then
professor
gregg
flamed
with
excitement
do
you
understand
yet
he
cried
but
i
have
told
you
a
good
deal
yes
and
shown
you
a
good
deal
you
have
heard
pretty
nearly
all
that
i
have
heard
and
seen
what
i
have
seen
or
at
least
and
his
voice
chilled
as
he
spoke
enough
to
make
a
good
deal
clear
as
noonday
the
servants
told
you
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
wretched
boy
cradock
had
another
seizure
the
night
before
last
he
awoke
me
with
cries
in
that
voice
you
heard
in
the
garden
and
i
went
to
him
and
god
forbid
you
should
see
what
i
saw
that
night
but
all
this
is
useless
my
time
here
is
drawing
to
a
close
i
must
be
back
in
town
in
three
weeks
as
i
have
a
course
of
lectures
to
prepare
and
need
all
my
books
about
me
in
a
very
few
days
it
will
be
all
over
and
i
shall
no
longer
hint
and
no
longer
be
liable
to
ridicule
as
a
madman
and
a
quack
no
i
shall
speak
plainly
and
i
shall
be
heard
with
such
emotions
as
perhaps
no
other
man
has
ever
drawn
from
the
breasts
of
his
fellows
he
paused
and
seemed
to
grow
radiant
with
the
joy
of
great
and
wonderful
discovery
but
all
that
is
for
the
future
the
near
future
certainly
but
still
the
future
he
went
on
at
length
there
is
something
to
be
done
yet
you
will
remember
my
telling
you
that
my
researches
were
not
altogether
devoid
of
peril
yes
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
danger
to
be
faced
i
did
not
know
how
much
when
i
spoke
on
the
subject
before
and
to
a
certain
extent
i
am
still
in
the
dark
but
it
will
be
a
strange
adventure
the
last
of
all
the
last
demonstration
in
the
chain
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
as
he
spoke
and
i
could
hear
in
his
voice
the
contending
tones
of
exultation
and
despondence
or
perhaps
i
should
say
awe
the
awe
of
a
man
who
goes
forth
on
unknown
waters
and
i
thought
of
his
allusion
to
columbus
on
the
night
he
had
laid
his
book
before
me
the
evening
was
a
little
chilly
and
a
fire
of
logs
had
been
lighted
in
the
study
where
we
were
and
the
remittent
flame
and
the
glow
on
the
walls
reminded
me
of
the
old
days
i
was
sitting
silent
in
an
armchair
by
the
fire
wondering
over
all
i
had
heard
and
still
vainly
speculating
as
to
the
secret
springs
concealed
from
me
under
all
the
phantasmagoria
i
had
witnessed
when
i
became
suddenly
aware
of
a
sensation
that
change
of
some
sort
had
been
at
work
in
the
room
and
that
there
was
something
unfamiliar
in
its
aspect
for
some
time
i
looked
about
me
trying
in
vain
to
localize
the
alteration
that
i
knew
had
been
made
the
table
by
the
window
the
chairs
the
faded
settee
were
all
as
i
had
known
them
suddenly
as
a
recollection
flashes
into
the
mind
i
knew
what
was
amiss
i
was
facing
the
professor
desk
which
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
and
above
the
desk
was
a
grimy
looking
bust
of
pitt
that
i
had
never
seen
there
before
and
then
i
remembered
the
true
position
of
this
work
of
art
in
the
furthest
corner
by
the
door
was
an
old
cupboard
projecting
into
the
room
and
on
the
top
of
the
cupboard
fifteen
feet
from
the
floor
the
bust
had
been
and
there
no
doubt
it
had
delayed
accumulating
dirt
since
the
early
years
of
the
century
i
was
utterly
amazed
and
sat
silent
still
in
a
confusion
of
thought
there
was
so
far
as
i
knew
no
such
thing
as
a
in
the
house
for
i
had
asked
for
one
to
make
some
alterations
in
the
curtains
of
my
room
and
a
tall
man
standing
on
a
chair
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
take
down
the
bust
it
had
been
placed
not
on
the
edge
of
the
cupboard
but
far
back
against
the
wall
and
professor
gregg
was
if
anything
under
the
average
height
how
on
earth
did
you
manage
to
get
down
pitt
i
said
at
last
the
professor
looked
curiously
at
me
and
seemed
to
hesitate
a
little
they
must
have
found
you
a
or
perhaps
the
gardener
brought
in
a
short
ladder
from
outside
no
i
have
had
no
ladder
of
any
kind
now
miss
lally
he
went
on
with
an
awkward
simulation
of
jest
there
is
a
little
puzzle
for
you
a
problem
in
the
manner
of
the
inimitable
holmes
there
are
the
facts
plain
and
patent
summon
your
acuteness
to
the
solution
of
the
puzzle
for
heaven
sake
he
cried
with
a
breaking
voice
say
no
more
about
it
i
tell
you
i
never
touched
the
thing
and
he
went
out
of
the
room
with
horror
manifest
on
his
face
and
his
hand
shook
and
jarred
the
door
behind
him
i
looked
round
the
room
in
vague
surprise
not
at
all
realizing
what
had
happened
making
vain
and
idle
surmises
by
way
of
explanation
and
wondering
at
the
stirring
of
black
waters
by
an
idle
word
and
the
trivial
change
of
an
ornament
this
is
some
petty
business
some
whim
on
which
i
have
jarred
i
reflected
the
professor
is
perhaps
scrupulous
and
superstitious
over
trifles
and
my
question
may
have
outraged
unacknowledged
fears
as
though
one
killed
a
spider
or
spilled
the
salt
before
the
very
eyes
of
a
practical
scotchwoman
i
was
immersed
in
these
fond
suspicions
and
began
to
plume
myself
a
little
on
my
immunity
from
such
empty
fears
when
the
truth
fell
heavily
as
lead
upon
my
heart
and
i
recognized
with
cold
terror
that
some
awful
influence
had
been
at
work
the
bust
was
simply
inaccessible
without
a
ladder
no
one
could
have
touched
it
i
went
out
to
the
kitchen
and
spoke
as
quietly
as
i
could
to
the
housemaid
who
moved
that
bust
from
the
top
of
the
cupboard
anne
i
said
to
her
professor
gregg
says
he
has
not
touched
it
did
you
find
an
old
in
one
of
the
outhouses
the
girl
looked
at
me
blankly
i
never
touched
it
she
said
i
found
it
where
it
is
now
the
other
morning
when
i
dusted
the
room
i
remember
now
it
was
wednesday
morning
because
it
was
the
morning
after
cradock
was
taken
bad
in
the
night
my
room
is
next
to
his
you
know
miss
the
girl
went
on
piteously
and
it
was
awful
to
hear
how
he
cried
and
called
out
names
that
i
could
understand
it
made
me
feel
all
afraid
and
then
master
came
and
i
heard
him
speak
and
he
took
down
cradock
to
the
study
and
gave
him
something
and
you
found
that
bust
moved
the
next
morning
yes
miss
there
was
a
queer
sort
of
a
smell
in
the
study
when
i
came
down
and
opened
the
windows
a
bad
smell
it
was
and
i
wondered
what
it
could
be
do
you
know
miss
i
went
a
long
time
ago
to
the
zoo
in
london
with
my
cousin
thomas
barker
one
afternoon
that
i
had
off
when
i
was
at
mrs
prince
in
stanhope
gate
and
we
went
into
the
to
see
the
snakes
and
it
was
just
the
same
sort
of
a
smell
very
sick
it
made
me
feel
i
remember
and
i
got
barker
to
take
me
out
and
it
was
just
the
same
kind
of
a
smell
in
the
study
as
i
was
saying
and
i
was
wondering
what
it
could
be
from
when
i
see
that
bust
with
pitt
cut
in
it
standing
on
the
master
desk
and
i
thought
to
myself
now
who
has
done
that
and
how
have
they
done
it
and
when
i
came
to
dust
the
things
i
looked
at
the
bust
and
i
saw
a
great
mark
on
it
where
the
dust
was
gone
for
i
do
think
it
can
have
been
touched
with
a
duster
for
years
and
years
and
it
was
like
but
a
large
patch
like
broad
and
spread
out
so
i
passed
my
hand
over
it
without
thinking
what
i
was
doing
and
where
that
patch
was
it
was
all
sticky
and
slimy
as
if
a
snail
had
crawled
over
it
very
strange
is
it
miss
and
i
wonder
who
can
have
done
it
and
how
that
mess
was
made
the
gabble
of
the
servant
touched
me
to
the
quick
i
lay
down
upon
my
bed
and
bit
my
lip
that
i
should
not
cry
out
loud
in
the
sharp
anguish
of
my
terror
and
bewilderment
indeed
i
was
almost
mad
with
dread
i
believe
that
if
it
had
been
daylight
i
should
have
fled
hot
foot
forgetting
all
courage
and
all
the
debt
of
gratitude
that
was
due
to
professor
gregg
not
caring
whether
my
fate
were
that
i
must
starve
slowly
so
long
as
i
might
escape
from
the
net
of
blind
and
panic
fear
that
every
day
seemed
to
draw
a
little
closer
round
me
if
i
knew
i
thought
if
i
knew
what
there
were
to
dread
i
could
guard
against
it
but
here
in
this
lonely
house
shut
in
on
all
sides
by
the
olden
woods
and
the
vaulted
hills
terror
seems
to
spring
inconsequent
from
every
covert
and
the
flesh
is
aghast
at
the
murmurs
of
horrible
things
all
in
vain
i
strove
to
summon
scepticism
to
my
aid
and
endeavored
by
cool
to
buttress
my
belief
in
a
world
of
natural
order
for
the
air
that
blew
in
at
the
open
window
was
a
mystic
breath
and
in
the
darkness
i
felt
the
silence
go
heavy
and
sorrowful
as
a
mass
of
requiem
and
i
conjured
images
of
strange
shapes
gathering
fast
amidst
the
reeds
beside
the
wash
of
the
river
in
the
morning
from
the
moment
that
i
set
foot
in
the
i
felt
that
the
unknown
plot
was
drawing
to
a
crisis
the
professor
face
was
firm
and
set
and
he
seemed
hardly
to
hear
our
voices
when
we
spoke
i
am
going
out
for
rather
a
long
walk
he
said
when
the
meal
was
over
you
must
be
expecting
me
now
or
thinking
anything
has
happened
if
i
do
turn
up
to
dinner
i
have
been
getting
stupid
lately
and
i
dare
say
a
miniature
walking
tour
will
do
me
good
perhaps
i
may
even
spend
the
night
in
some
little
inn
if
i
find
any
place
that
looks
clean
and
comfortable
i
heard
this
and
knew
by
my
experience
of
professor
gregg
manner
that
it
was
no
ordinary
business
or
pleasure
that
impelled
him
i
knew
not
nor
even
remotely
guessed
where
he
was
bound
nor
had
i
the
vaguest
notion
of
his
errand
but
all
the
fear
of
the
night
before
returned
and
as
he
stood
smiling
on
the
terrace
ready
to
set
out
i
implored
him
to
stay
and
to
forget
all
his
dreams
of
the
undiscovered
continent
no
no
miss
lally
he
replied
still
smiling
it
too
late
now
nulla
you
know
is
the
device
of
all
true
explorers
though
i
hope
it
wo
be
literally
true
in
my
ease
but
indeed
you
are
wrong
to
alarm
yourself
so
i
look
upon
my
little
expedition
as
quite
commonplace
no
more
exciting
than
a
day
with
the
geological
hammers
there
is
a
risk
of
course
but
so
there
is
on
the
commonest
excursion
i
can
afford
to
be
jaunty
i
am
doing
nothing
so
hazardous
as
does
a
hundred
times
over
in
the
course
of
every
bank
holiday
well
then
you
must
look
more
cheerfully
and
so
till
at
latest
he
walked
briskly
up
the
road
and
i
saw
him
open
the
gate
that
marks
the
entrance
of
the
wood
and
then
he
vanished
in
the
gloom
of
the
trees
all
the
day
passed
heavily
with
a
strange
darkness
in
the
air
and
again
i
felt
as
if
imprisoned
amidst
the
ancient
woods
shut
in
an
olden
land
of
mystery
and
dread
and
as
if
all
was
long
ago
and
forgotten
by
the
living
outside
i
hoped
and
dreaded
and
when
the
came
i
waited
expecting
to
hear
the
professor
step
in
the
hall
and
his
voice
exulting
at
i
knew
not
what
triumph
i
composed
my
face
to
welcome
him
gladly
but
the
night
descended
dark
and
he
did
not
come
in
the
morning
when
the
maid
knocked
at
my
door
i
called
out
to
her
and
asked
if
her
master
had
returned
and
when
she
replied
that
his
bedroom
stood
open
and
empty
i
felt
the
cold
clasp
of
despair
still
i
fancied
he
might
have
discovered
genial
company
and
would
return
for
luncheon
or
perhaps
in
the
afternoon
and
i
took
the
children
for
a
walk
in
the
forest
and
tried
my
best
to
play
and
laugh
with
them
and
to
shut
out
the
thoughts
of
mystery
and
veiled
terror
hour
after
hour
i
waited
and
my
thoughts
grew
darker
again
the
night
came
and
found
me
watching
and
at
last
as
i
was
making
much
ado
to
finish
my
dinner
i
heard
steps
outside
and
the
sound
of
a
man
voice
the
maid
came
in
and
looked
oddly
at
me
please
miss
she
began
morgan
the
gardener
wants
to
speak
to
you
for
a
minute
if
you
did
mind
show
him
in
please
i
answered
and
i
set
my
lips
tight
the
old
man
came
slowly
into
the
room
and
the
servant
shut
the
door
behind
him
sit
down
morgan
i
said
what
is
it
that
you
want
to
say
to
me
well
miss
gregg
he
gave
me
something
for
you
yesterday
morning
just
before
he
went
off
and
he
told
me
particular
not
to
hand
it
up
before
eight
this
evening
exactly
if
so
be
as
he
was
back
again
home
before
and
if
he
should
come
home
before
i
was
just
to
return
it
to
him
in
his
own
hands
so
you
see
as
gregg
is
here
yet
i
suppose
i
better
give
you
the
parcel
directly
he
pulled
out
something
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
me
half
rising
i
took
it
silently
and
seeing
that
morgan
seemed
doubtful
as
to
what
he
was
to
do
next
i
thanked
him
and
bade
him
and
he
went
out
i
was
left
alone
in
the
room
with
the
parcel
in
my
hand
a
paper
parcel
neatly
sealed
and
directed
to
me
with
the
instructions
morgan
had
quoted
all
written
in
the
professor
large
loose
hand
i
broke
the
seals
with
a
choking
at
my
heart
and
found
an
envelope
inside
addressed
also
but
open
and
i
took
the
letter
out
my
dear
miss
lally
it
began
to
quote
the
old
logic
manual
the
case
of
your
reading
this
note
is
a
case
of
my
having
made
a
blunder
of
some
sort
and
i
am
afraid
a
blunder
that
turns
these
lines
into
a
farewell
it
is
practically
certain
that
neither
you
nor
anyone
else
will
ever
see
me
again
i
have
made
my
will
with
provision
for
this
eventuality
and
i
hope
you
will
consent
to
accept
the
small
remembrance
addressed
to
you
and
my
sincere
thanks
for
the
way
in
which
you
joined
your
fortunes
to
mine
the
fate
which
has
come
upon
me
is
desperate
and
terrible
beyond
the
remotest
dreams
of
man
but
this
fate
you
have
a
right
to
know
if
you
please
if
you
look
in
the
drawer
of
my
you
will
find
the
key
of
the
escritoire
properly
labelled
in
the
well
of
the
escritoire
is
a
large
envelope
sealed
and
addressed
to
your
name
i
advise
you
to
throw
it
forthwith
into
the
fire
you
will
sleep
better
of
nights
if
you
do
so
but
if
you
must
know
the
history
of
what
has
happened
it
is
all
written
down
for
you
to
read
the
signature
was
firmly
written
below
and
again
i
turned
the
page
and
read
out
the
words
one
by
one
aghast
and
white
to
the
lips
my
hands
cold
as
ice
and
sickness
choking
me
the
dead
silence
of
the
room
and
the
thought
of
the
dark
woods
and
hills
closing
me
in
on
every
side
oppressed
me
helpless
and
without
capacity
and
not
knowing
where
to
turn
for
counsel
at
last
i
resolved
that
though
knowledge
should
haunt
my
whole
life
and
all
the
days
to
come
i
must
know
the
meaning
of
the
strange
terrors
that
had
so
long
tormented
me
rising
gray
dim
and
awful
like
the
shadows
in
the
wood
at
dusk
i
carefully
carried
out
professor
gregg
directions
and
not
without
reluctance
broke
the
seal
of
the
envelope
and
spread
out
his
manuscript
before
me
that
manuscript
i
always
carry
with
me
and
i
see
that
i
can
not
deny
your
unspoken
request
to
read
it
this
then
was
what
i
read
that
night
sitting
at
the
desk
with
a
shaded
lamp
beside
me
the
young
lady
who
called
herself
miss
lally
then
proceeded
to
recite
statement
of
william
gregg
it
is
many
years
since
the
first
glimmer
of
the
theory
which
is
now
almost
if
not
quite
reduced
to
fact
dawned
first
on
my
mind
a
somewhat
extensive
course
of
miscellaneous
and
obsolete
reading
had
done
a
good
deal
to
prepare
the
way
and
later
when
i
became
somewhat
of
a
specialist
and
immersed
myself
in
the
studies
known
as
ethnological
i
was
now
and
then
startled
by
facts
that
would
not
square
with
orthodox
scientific
opinion
and
by
discoveries
that
seemed
to
hint
at
something
still
hidden
for
all
our
research
more
particularly
i
became
convinced
that
much
of
the
of
the
world
is
but
an
exaggerated
account
of
events
that
really
happened
and
i
was
especially
drawn
to
consider
the
stories
of
the
fairies
the
good
folk
of
the
celtic
races
here
i
thought
i
could
detect
the
fringe
of
embroidery
and
exaggeration
the
fantastic
guise
the
little
people
dressed
in
green
and
gold
sporting
in
the
flowers
and
i
thought
i
saw
a
distinct
analogy
between
the
name
given
to
this
race
supposed
to
be
imaginary
and
the
description
of
their
appearance
and
manners
just
as
our
remote
ancestors
called
the
dreaded
beings
fair
and
good
precisely
because
they
dreaded
them
so
they
had
dressed
them
up
in
charming
forms
knowing
the
truth
to
be
the
very
reverse
literature
too
had
gone
early
to
work
and
had
lent
a
powerful
hand
in
the
transformation
so
that
the
playful
elves
of
shakespeare
are
already
far
removed
from
the
true
original
and
the
real
horror
is
disguised
in
a
form
of
prankish
mischief
but
in
the
older
tales
the
stories
that
used
to
make
men
cross
themselves
as
they
sat
round
the
burning
logs
we
tread
a
different
stage
i
saw
a
widely
opposed
spirit
in
certain
histories
of
children
and
of
men
and
women
who
vanished
strangely
from
the
earth
they
would
be
seen
by
a
peasant
in
the
fields
walking
towards
some
green
and
rounded
hillock
and
seen
no
more
on
earth
and
there
are
stories
of
mothers
who
have
left
a
child
quietly
sleeping
with
the
cottage
door
rudely
barred
with
a
piece
of
wood
and
have
returned
not
to
find
the
plump
and
rosy
little
saxon
but
a
thin
and
wizened
creature
with
sallow
skin
and
black
piercing
eyes
the
child
of
another
race
then
again
there
were
myths
darker
still
the
dread
of
witch
and
wizard
the
lurid
evil
of
the
sabbath
and
the
hint
of
demons
who
mingled
with
the
daughters
of
men
and
just
as
we
have
turned
the
terrible
fair
folk
into
a
company
of
benignant
if
freakish
elves
so
we
have
hidden
from
us
the
black
foulness
of
the
witch
and
her
companions
under
a
popular
of
old
women
and
broomsticks
and
a
comic
cat
with
tail
on
end
so
the
greeks
called
the
hideous
furies
benevolent
ladies
and
thus
the
northern
nations
have
followed
their
example
i
pursued
my
investigations
stealing
odd
hours
from
other
and
more
imperative
labors
and
i
asked
myself
the
question
supposing
these
traditions
to
be
true
who
were
the
demons
who
are
reported
to
have
attended
the
sabbaths
i
need
not
say
that
i
laid
aside
what
i
may
call
the
supernatural
hypothesis
of
the
middle
ages
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
fairies
and
devils
were
of
one
and
the
same
race
and
origin
invention
no
doubt
and
the
gothic
fancy
of
old
days
had
done
much
in
the
way
of
exaggeration
and
distortion
yet
i
firmly
believed
that
beneath
all
this
imagery
there
was
a
black
background
of
truth
as
for
some
of
the
alleged
wonders
i
hesitated
while
i
should
be
very
loth
to
receive
any
one
specific
instance
of
modern
spiritualism
as
containing
even
a
grain
of
the
genuine
yet
i
was
not
wholly
prepared
to
deny
that
human
flesh
may
now
and
then
once
perhaps
in
ten
million
cases
be
the
veil
of
powers
which
seem
magical
to
us
powers
which
so
far
from
proceeding
from
the
heights
and
leading
men
thither
are
in
reality
survivals
from
the
depths
of
being
the
amoeba
and
the
snail
have
powers
which
we
do
not
possess
and
i
thought
it
possible
that
the
theory
of
reversion
might
explain
many
things
which
seem
wholly
inexplicable
thus
stood
my
position
i
saw
good
reason
to
believe
that
much
of
the
tradition
a
vast
deal
of
the
earliest
and
uncorrupted
tradition
of
the
fairies
represented
solid
fact
and
i
thought
that
the
purely
supernatural
element
in
these
traditions
was
to
be
accounted
for
on
the
hypothesis
that
a
race
which
had
fallen
out
of
the
grand
march
of
evolution
might
have
retained
as
a
survival
certain
powers
which
would
be
to
us
wholly
miraculous
such
was
my
theory
as
it
stood
conceived
in
my
mind
and
working
with
this
in
view
i
seemed
to
gather
confirmation
from
every
side
from
the
spoils
of
a
tumulus
or
a
barrow
from
a
local
paper
reporting
an
antiquarian
meeting
in
the
country
and
from
general
literature
of
all
kinds
amongst
other
instances
i
remember
being
struck
by
the
phrase
men
in
homer
as
if
the
writer
knew
or
had
heard
of
men
whose
speech
was
so
rude
that
it
could
hardly
be
termed
articulate
and
on
my
hypothesis
of
a
race
who
had
lagged
far
behind
the
rest
i
could
easily
conceive
that
such
a
folk
would
speak
a
jargon
but
little
removed
from
the
inarticulate
noises
of
thus
i
stood
satisfied
that
my
conjecture
was
at
all
events
not
far
removed
from
fact
when
a
chance
paragraph
in
a
small
country
print
one
day
arrested
my
attention
it
was
a
short
account
of
what
was
to
all
appearance
the
usual
sordid
tragedy
of
the
village
a
young
girl
unaccountably
missing
and
evil
rumor
blatant
and
busy
with
her
reputation
yet
i
could
read
between
the
lines
that
all
this
scandal
was
purely
hypothetical
and
in
all
probability
invented
to
account
for
what
was
in
any
other
manner
unaccountable
a
flight
to
london
or
liverpool
or
an
undiscovered
body
lying
with
a
weight
about
its
neck
in
the
foul
depths
of
a
woodland
pool
of
perhaps
murder
such
were
the
theories
of
the
wretched
girl
neighbors
but
as
i
idly
scanned
the
paragraph
a
flash
of
thought
passed
through
me
with
the
violence
of
an
electric
shock
what
if
the
obscure
and
horrible
race
of
the
hills
still
survived
still
remained
haunting
wild
places
and
barren
hills
and
now
and
then
repeating
the
evil
of
gothic
legend
unchanged
and
unchangeable
as
the
turanian
shelta
or
the
basques
of
spain
i
have
said
that
the
thought
came
with
violence
and
indeed
i
drew
in
my
breath
sharply
and
clung
with
both
hands
to
my
in
a
strange
confusion
of
horror
and
elation
it
was
as
if
one
of
my
of
physical
science
roaming
in
a
quiet
english
wood
had
been
suddenly
stricken
aghast
by
the
presence
of
the
slimy
and
loathsome
terror
of
the
ichthyosaurus
the
original
of
the
stories
of
the
awful
worms
killed
by
valorous
knights
or
had
seen
the
sun
darkened
by
the
pterodactyl
the
dragon
of
tradition
yet
as
a
resolute
explorer
of
knowledge
the
thought
of
such
a
discovery
threw
me
into
a
passion
of
joy
and
i
cut
out
the
slip
from
the
paper
and
put
it
in
a
drawer
in
my
old
bureau
resolved
that
it
should
be
but
the
first
piece
in
a
collection
of
the
strangest
significance
i
sat
long
that
evening
dreaming
of
the
conclusions
i
should
establish
nor
did
cooler
reflection
at
first
dash
my
confidence
yet
as
i
began
to
put
the
case
fairly
i
saw
that
i
might
be
building
on
an
unstable
foundation
the
facts
might
possibly
be
in
accordance
with
local
opinion
and
i
regarded
the
affair
with
a
mood
of
some
reserve
yet
i
resolved
to
remain
perched
on
the
and
i
hugged
to
myself
the
thought
that
i
alone
was
watching
and
wakeful
while
the
great
crowd
of
thinkers
and
searchers
stood
heedless
and
indifferent
perhaps
letting
the
most
prerogative
facts
pass
by
unnoticed
several
years
elapsed
before
i
was
enabled
to
add
to
the
contents
of
the
drawer
and
the
second
find
was
in
reality
not
a
valuable
one
for
it
was
a
mere
repetition
of
the
first
with
only
the
variation
of
another
and
distant
locality
yet
i
gained
something
for
in
the
second
case
as
in
the
first
the
tragedy
took
place
in
a
desolate
and
lonely
country
and
so
far
my
theory
seemed
justified
but
the
third
piece
was
to
me
far
more
decisive
again
amongst
outland
hills
far
even
from
a
main
road
of
traffic
an
old
man
was
found
done
to
death
and
the
instrument
of
execution
was
left
beside
him
here
indeed
there
was
rumor
and
conjecture
for
the
deadly
tool
was
a
primitive
stone
axe
bound
by
gut
to
the
wooden
handle
and
surmises
the
most
extravagant
and
improbable
were
indulged
in
yet
as
i
thought
with
a
kind
of
glee
the
wildest
conjectures
went
far
astray
and
i
took
the
pains
to
enter
into
correspondence
with
the
local
doctor
who
was
called
at
the
inquest
he
a
man
of
some
acuteness
was
dumfoundered
it
will
not
do
to
speak
of
these
things
in
country
places
he
wrote
to
me
but
frankly
professor
gregg
there
is
some
hideous
mystery
here
i
have
obtained
possession
of
the
stone
axe
and
have
been
so
curious
as
to
test
its
powers
i
took
it
into
the
of
my
house
one
sunday
afternoon
when
my
family
and
the
servants
were
all
out
and
there
sheltered
by
the
poplar
hedges
i
made
my
experiments
i
found
the
thing
utterly
unmanageable
whether
there
is
some
peculiar
balance
some
nice
adjustment
of
weights
which
require
incessant
practice
or
whether
an
effectual
blow
can
be
struck
only
by
a
certain
trick
of
the
muscles
i
do
not
know
but
i
assure
you
that
i
went
into
the
house
with
but
a
sorry
opinion
of
my
athletic
capacities
it
was
like
an
inexperienced
man
trying
the
hammer
the
force
exerted
seemed
to
return
on
oneself
and
i
found
myself
hurled
backwards
with
violence
while
the
axe
fell
harmless
to
the
ground
on
another
occasion
i
tried
the
experiment
with
a
clever
woodman
of
the
place
but
this
man
who
had
handled
his
axe
for
forty
years
could
do
nothing
with
the
stone
implement
and
missed
every
stroke
most
ludicrously
in
short
if
it
were
not
so
supremely
absurd
i
should
say
that
for
four
thousand
years
no
one
on
earth
could
have
struck
an
effective
blow
with
the
tool
that
undoubtedly
was
used
to
murder
the
old
man
this
as
may
be
imagined
was
to
me
rare
news
and
afterwards
when
i
heard
the
whole
story
and
learned
that
the
unfortunate
old
man
had
babbled
tales
of
what
might
be
seen
at
night
on
a
certain
wild
hillside
hinting
at
wonders
and
that
he
had
been
found
cold
one
morning
on
the
very
hill
in
question
my
exultation
was
extreme
for
i
felt
i
was
leaving
conjecture
far
behind
me
but
the
next
step
was
of
still
greater
importance
i
had
possessed
for
many
years
an
extraordinary
stone
seal
a
piece
of
dull
black
stone
two
inches
long
from
the
handle
to
the
stamp
and
the
stamping
end
a
rough
hexagon
an
inch
and
a
quarter
in
diameter
altogether
it
presented
the
appearance
of
an
enlarged
of
an
make
it
had
been
sent
to
me
by
an
agent
in
the
east
who
informed
me
that
it
had
been
found
near
the
site
of
the
ancient
babylon
but
the
characters
engraved
on
the
seal
were
to
me
an
intolerable
puzzle
somewhat
of
the
cuneiform
pattern
there
were
yet
striking
differences
which
i
detected
at
the
first
glance
and
all
efforts
to
read
the
inscription
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
rules
for
deciphering
the
writing
would
apply
proved
futile
a
riddle
such
as
this
stung
my
pride
and
at
odd
moments
i
would
take
the
black
seal
out
of
the
cabinet
and
scrutinize
it
with
so
much
idle
perseverance
that
every
letter
was
familiar
to
my
mind
and
i
could
have
drawn
the
inscription
from
memory
without
the
slightest
error
judge
then
of
my
surprise
when
i
one
day
received
from
a
correspondent
in
the
west
of
england
a
letter
and
an
enclosure
that
positively
left
me
thunderstruck
i
saw
carefully
traced
on
a
large
piece
of
paper
the
very
characters
of
the
black
seal
without
alteration
of
any
kind
and
above
the
inscription
my
friend
had
written
found
on
a
limestone
rock
on
the
grey
hills
monmouthshire
done
in
some
red
earth
and
quite
i
turned
to
the
letter
my
friend
wrote
i
send
you
the
enclosed
inscription
with
all
due
reserve
a
shepherd
who
passed
by
the
stone
a
week
ago
swears
that
there
was
then
no
mark
of
any
kind
the
characters
as
i
have
noted
are
formed
by
drawing
some
red
earth
over
the
stone
and
are
of
an
average
height
of
one
inch
they
look
to
me
like
a
kind
of
cuneiform
character
a
good
deal
altered
but
this
of
course
is
impossible
it
may
be
either
a
hoax
or
more
probably
some
scribble
of
the
gypsies
who
are
plentiful
enough
in
this
wild
country
they
have
as
you
are
aware
many
hieroglyphics
which
they
use
in
communicating
with
one
another
i
happened
to
visit
the
stone
in
question
two
days
ago
in
connection
with
a
rather
painful
incident
which
has
occurred
here
as
may
be
supposed
i
wrote
immediately
to
my
friend
thanking
him
for
the
copy
of
the
inscription
and
asking
him
in
a
casual
manner
the
history
of
the
incident
he
mentioned
to
be
brief
i
heard
that
a
woman
named
cradock
who
had
lost
her
husband
a
day
before
had
set
out
to
communicate
the
sad
news
to
a
cousin
who
lived
some
five
miles
away
she
took
a
short
cut
which
led
by
the
gray
hills
cradock
who
was
then
quite
a
young
woman
never
arrived
at
her
relative
house
late
that
night
a
farmer
who
had
lost
a
couple
of
sheep
supposed
to
have
wandered
from
the
flock
was
walking
over
the
gray
hills
with
a
lantern
and
his
dog
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
noise
which
he
described
as
a
kind
of
wailing
mournful
and
pitiable
to
hear
and
guided
by
the
sound
he
found
the
unfortunate
cradock
crouched
on
the
ground
by
the
limestone
rock
swaying
her
body
to
and
fro
and
lamenting
and
crying
in
so
a
manner
that
the
farmer
was
as
he
says
at
first
obliged
to
stop
his
ears
or
he
would
have
run
away
the
woman
allowed
herself
to
be
taken
home
and
a
neighbor
came
to
see
to
her
necessities
all
the
night
she
never
ceased
her
crying
mixing
her
lament
with
words
of
some
unintelligible
jargon
and
when
the
doctor
arrived
he
pronounced
her
insane
she
lay
on
her
bed
for
a
week
now
wailing
as
people
said
like
one
lost
and
damned
for
eternity
and
now
sunk
in
a
heavy
coma
it
was
thought
that
grief
at
the
loss
of
her
husband
had
unsettled
her
mind
and
the
medical
man
did
not
at
one
time
expect
her
to
live
i
need
not
say
that
i
was
deeply
interested
in
this
story
and
i
made
my
friend
write
to
me
at
intervals
with
all
the
particulars
of
the
case
i
heard
then
that
in
the
course
of
six
weeks
the
woman
gradually
recovered
the
use
of
her
faculties
and
some
months
later
she
gave
birth
to
a
son
christened
jervase
who
unhappily
proved
to
be
of
weak
intellect
such
were
the
facts
known
to
the
village
but
to
me
while
i
whitened
at
the
suggested
thought
of
the
hideous
enormities
that
had
doubtless
been
committed
all
this
was
nothing
short
of
conviction
and
i
incautiously
hazarded
a
hint
of
something
like
the
truth
to
some
scientific
friends
the
moment
the
words
had
left
my
lips
i
bitterly
regretted
having
spoken
and
thus
given
away
the
great
secret
of
my
life
but
with
a
good
deal
of
relief
mixed
with
indignation
i
found
my
fears
altogether
misplaced
for
my
friends
ridiculed
me
to
my
face
and
i
was
regarded
as
a
madman
and
beneath
a
natural
anger
i
chuckled
to
myself
feeling
as
secure
amidst
these
blockheads
as
if
i
had
confided
what
i
knew
to
the
desert
sands
but
now
knowing
so
much
i
resolved
i
would
know
all
and
i
concentrated
my
efforts
on
the
task
of
deciphering
the
inscription
on
the
black
seal
for
many
years
i
made
this
puzzle
the
sole
object
of
my
leisure
moments
for
the
greater
portion
of
my
time
was
of
course
devoted
to
other
duties
and
it
was
only
now
and
then
that
i
could
snatch
a
week
of
clear
research
if
i
were
to
tell
the
full
history
of
this
curious
investigation
this
statement
would
be
wearisome
in
the
extreme
for
it
would
contain
simply
the
account
of
long
and
tedious
failure
by
what
i
knew
already
of
ancient
scripts
i
was
for
the
chase
as
i
always
termed
it
to
myself
i
had
correspondents
amongst
all
the
scientific
men
in
europe
and
indeed
in
the
world
and
i
could
not
believe
that
in
these
days
any
character
however
ancient
and
however
perplexed
could
long
resist
the
i
should
bring
to
bear
upon
it
yet
in
point
of
fact
it
was
fully
fourteen
years
before
i
succeeded
with
every
year
my
professional
duties
increased
and
my
leisure
became
smaller
this
no
doubt
retarded
me
a
good
deal
and
yet
when
i
look
back
on
those
years
i
am
astonished
at
the
vast
scope
of
my
investigation
of
the
black
seal
i
made
my
bureau
a
centre
and
from
all
the
world
and
from
all
the
ages
i
gathered
transcripts
of
ancient
writing
nothing
i
resolved
should
pass
me
unawares
and
the
faintest
hint
should
be
welcomed
and
followed
up
but
as
one
covert
after
another
was
tried
and
proved
empty
of
result
i
began
in
the
course
of
years
to
despair
and
to
wonder
whether
the
black
seal
were
the
sole
relic
of
some
race
that
had
vanished
from
the
world
and
left
no
other
trace
of
its
existence
had
perished
in
fine
as
atlantis
is
said
to
have
done
in
some
great
cataclysm
its
secrets
perhaps
drowned
beneath
the
ocean
or
moulded
into
the
heart
of
the
hills
the
thought
chilled
my
warmth
a
little
and
though
i
still
persevered
it
was
no
longer
with
the
same
certainty
of
faith
a
chance
came
to
the
rescue
i
was
staying
in
a
considerable
town
in
the
north
of
england
and
took
the
opportunity
of
going
over
the
very
creditable
museum
that
had
for
some
time
been
established
in
the
place
the
curator
was
one
of
my
correspondents
and
as
we
were
looking
through
one
of
the
mineral
cases
my
attention
was
struck
by
a
specimen
a
piece
of
black
stone
some
four
inches
square
the
appearance
of
which
reminded
me
in
a
measure
of
the
black
seal
i
took
it
up
carelessly
and
was
turning
it
over
in
my
hand
when
i
saw
to
my
astonishment
that
the
under
side
was
inscribed
i
said
quietly
enough
to
my
friend
the
curator
that
the
specimen
interested
me
and
that
i
should
be
much
obliged
if
he
would
allow
me
to
take
it
with
me
to
my
hotel
for
a
couple
of
days
he
of
course
made
no
objection
and
i
hurried
to
my
rooms
and
found
that
my
first
glance
had
not
deceived
me
there
were
two
inscriptions
one
in
the
regular
cuneiform
character
another
in
the
character
of
the
black
seal
and
i
realized
that
my
task
was
accomplished
i
made
an
exact
copy
of
the
two
inscriptions
and
when
i
got
to
my
london
study
and
had
the
seal
before
me
i
was
able
seriously
to
grapple
with
the
great
problem
the
interpreting
inscription
on
the
museum
specimen
though
in
itself
curious
enough
did
not
bear
on
my
quest
but
the
transliteration
made
me
master
of
the
secret
of
the
black
seal
conjecture
of
course
had
to
enter
into
my
calculations
there
was
here
and
there
uncertainty
about
a
particular
ideograph
and
one
sign
recurring
again
and
again
on
the
seal
baffled
me
for
many
successive
nights
but
at
last
the
secret
stood
open
before
me
in
plain
english
and
i
read
the
key
of
the
awful
transmutation
of
the
hills
the
last
word
was
hardly
written
when
with
fingers
all
trembling
and
unsteady
i
tore
the
scrap
of
paper
into
the
minutest
fragments
and
saw
them
flame
and
blacken
in
the
red
hollow
of
the
fire
and
then
i
crushed
the
gray
films
that
remained
into
finest
powder
never
since
then
have
i
written
those
words
never
will
i
write
the
phrases
which
tell
me
how
man
can
be
reduced
to
the
slime
from
which
he
came
and
be
forced
to
put
on
the
flesh
of
the
reptile
and
the
snake
there
was
now
but
one
thing
remaining
i
knew
but
i
desired
to
see
and
i
was
after
some
time
able
to
take
a
house
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
gray
hills
and
not
far
from
the
cottage
where
cradock
and
her
son
jervase
resided
i
need
not
go
into
a
full
and
detailed
account
of
the
apparently
inexplicable
events
which
have
occurred
here
where
i
am
writing
this
i
knew
that
i
should
find
in
jervase
cradock
something
of
the
blood
of
the
little
people
and
i
found
later
that
he
had
more
than
once
encountered
his
kinsmen
in
lonely
places
in
that
lonely
land
when
i
was
summoned
one
day
to
the
garden
and
found
him
in
a
seizure
speaking
or
hissing
the
ghastly
jargon
of
the
black
seal
i
am
afraid
that
exultation
prevailed
over
pity
i
heard
bursting
from
his
lips
the
secrets
of
the
underworld
and
the
word
of
dread
ishakshar
the
signification
of
which
i
must
be
excused
from
giving
but
there
is
one
incident
i
can
not
pass
over
unnoticed
in
the
waste
hollow
of
the
night
i
awoke
at
the
sound
of
those
hissing
syllables
i
knew
so
well
and
on
going
to
the
wretched
boy
room
i
found
him
convulsed
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
struggling
on
the
bed
as
if
he
strove
to
escape
the
grasp
of
writhing
demons
i
took
him
down
to
my
room
and
lit
the
lamp
while
he
lay
twisting
on
the
floor
calling
on
the
power
within
his
flesh
to
leave
him
i
saw
his
body
swell
and
become
distended
as
a
bladder
while
the
face
blackened
before
my
eyes
and
then
at
the
crisis
i
did
what
was
necessary
according
to
the
directions
on
the
seal
and
putting
all
scruple
on
one
side
i
became
a
man
of
science
observant
of
what
was
passing
yet
the
sight
i
had
to
witness
was
horrible
almost
beyond
the
power
of
human
conception
and
the
most
fearful
fantasy
something
pushed
out
from
the
body
there
on
the
floor
and
stretched
forth
a
slimy
wavering
tentacle
across
the
room
and
grasped
the
bust
upon
the
cupboard
and
laid
it
down
on
my
desk
when
it
was
over
and
i
was
left
to
walk
up
and
down
all
the
rest
of
the
night
white
and
shuddering
with
sweat
pouring
from
my
flesh
i
vainly
tried
to
reason
with
myself
i
said
truly
enough
that
i
had
seen
nothing
really
supernatural
that
a
snail
pushing
out
his
horns
and
drawing
them
in
was
but
an
instance
on
a
smaller
scale
of
what
i
had
witnessed
and
yet
horror
broke
through
all
such
reasonings
and
left
me
shattered
and
loathing
myself
for
the
share
i
had
taken
in
the
work
there
is
little
more
to
be
said
i
am
going
now
to
the
final
trial
and
encounter
for
i
have
determined
that
there
shall
be
nothing
wanting
and
i
shall
meet
the
little
people
face
to
face
i
shall
have
the
black
seal
and
the
knowledge
of
its
secrets
to
help
me
and
if
i
unhappily
do
not
return
from
my
journey
there
is
no
need
to
conjure
up
here
a
picture
of
the
awfulness
of
my
fate
pausing
a
little
at
the
end
of
professor
gregg
statement
miss
lally
continued
her
tale
in
the
following
words
such
was
the
almost
incredible
story
that
the
professor
had
left
behind
him
when
i
had
finished
reading
it
it
was
late
at
night
but
the
next
morning
i
took
morgan
with
me
and
we
proceeded
to
search
the
gray
hills
for
some
trace
of
the
lost
professor
i
will
not
weary
you
with
a
description
of
the
savage
desolation
of
that
tract
of
country
a
tract
of
utterest
loneliness
of
bare
green
hills
dotted
over
with
gray
limestone
boulders
worn
by
the
ravage
of
time
into
fantastic
semblances
of
men
and
beasts
finally
after
many
hours
of
weary
searching
we
found
what
i
told
you
the
watch
and
chain
the
purse
and
the
ring
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
coarse
parchment
when
morgan
cut
the
gut
that
bound
the
parcel
together
and
i
saw
the
professor
property
i
burst
into
tears
but
the
sight
of
the
dreaded
characters
of
the
black
seal
repeated
on
the
parchment
froze
me
to
silent
horror
and
i
think
i
understood
for
the
first
time
the
awful
fate
that
had
come
upon
my
late
employer
i
have
only
to
add
that
professor
gregg
lawyer
treated
my
account
of
what
had
happened
as
a
fairy
tale
and
refused
even
to
glance
at
the
documents
i
laid
before
him
it
was
he
who
was
responsible
for
the
statement
that
appeared
in
the
public
press
to
the
effect
that
professor
gregg
had
been
drowned
and
that
his
body
must
have
been
swept
into
the
open
sea
miss
lally
stopped
speaking
and
looked
at
phillipps
with
a
glance
of
some
enquiry
he
for
his
part
was
sunken
in
a
deep
revery
of
thought
and
when
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
bustle
of
the
evening
gathering
in
the
square
men
and
women
hurrying
to
partake
of
dinner
and
crowds
already
besetting
the
all
the
hum
and
press
of
actual
life
seemed
unreal
and
visionary
a
dream
in
the
morning
after
an
awakening
i
thank
you
he
said
at
last
for
your
most
interesting
story
interesting
to
me
because
i
feel
fully
convinced
of
its
exact
truth
sir
said
the
lady
with
some
energy
of
indignation
you
grieve
and
offend
me
do
you
think
i
should
waste
my
time
and
yours
by
concocting
fictions
on
a
bench
in
leicester
square
pardon
me
miss
lally
you
have
a
little
misunderstood
me
before
you
began
i
knew
that
whatever
you
told
would
be
told
in
good
faith
but
your
experiences
have
a
far
higher
value
than
that
of
the
most
extraordinary
circumstances
in
your
account
are
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
very
latest
scientific
theories
professor
lodge
would
i
am
sure
value
a
communication
from
you
extremely
i
was
charmed
from
the
first
by
his
daring
hypothesis
in
explanation
of
the
wonders
of
spiritualism
so
called
but
your
narrative
puts
the
whole
matter
out
of
the
range
of
mere
hypothesis
alas
sir
all
this
will
not
help
me
you
forget
i
have
lost
my
brother
under
the
most
startling
and
dreadful
circumstances
again
i
ask
you
did
you
not
see
him
as
you
came
here
his
black
whiskers
his
spectacles
his
timid
glance
to
right
and
left
think
do
not
these
particulars
recall
his
face
to
your
memory
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
have
never
seen
any
one
of
the
kind
said
phillipps
who
had
forgotten
all
about
the
missing
brother
but
let
me
ask
you
a
few
questions
did
you
notice
whether
professor
gregg
pardon
me
sir
i
have
stayed
too
long
my
employers
will
be
expecting
me
i
thank
you
for
your
sympathy
good
bye
before
phillipps
had
recovered
from
his
amazement
at
this
abrupt
departure
miss
lally
had
disappeared
from
his
gaze
passing
into
the
crowd
that
now
thronged
the
approaches
to
the
empire
he
walked
home
in
a
pensive
frame
of
mind
and
drank
too
much
tea
at
ten
he
had
made
his
third
brew
and
had
sketched
out
the
outlines
of
a
little
work
to
be
called
incident
of
the
private
bar
dyson
often
meditated
at
odd
moments
over
the
singular
tale
he
had
listened
to
at
the
café
de
la
touraine
in
the
first
place
he
cherished
a
profound
conviction
that
the
words
of
truth
were
scattered
with
a
too
niggardly
and
sparing
hand
over
the
agreeable
history
of
smith
and
the
black
gulf
cañon
and
secondly
there
was
the
undeniable
fact
of
the
profound
agitation
of
the
narrator
and
his
gestures
on
the
pavement
too
violent
to
be
simulated
the
idea
of
a
man
going
about
london
haunted
by
the
fear
of
meeting
a
young
man
with
spectacles
struck
dyson
as
supremely
ridiculous
he
searched
his
memory
for
some
precedent
in
romance
but
without
success
he
paid
visits
at
odd
times
to
the
little
café
hoping
to
find
wilkins
there
and
he
kept
a
sharp
watch
on
the
great
generation
of
the
spectacled
men
without
much
doubt
that
he
would
remember
the
face
of
the
individual
whom
he
had
seen
dart
out
of
the
aerated
bread
shop
all
his
peregrinations
and
researches
however
seemed
to
lead
to
nothing
of
value
and
dyson
needed
all
his
warm
conviction
of
his
innate
detective
powers
and
his
strong
scent
for
mystery
to
sustain
him
in
his
endeavors
in
fact
he
had
two
affairs
on
hand
and
every
day
as
he
passed
through
streets
crowded
or
deserted
and
lurked
in
the
obscure
districts
and
watched
at
corners
he
was
more
than
surprised
to
find
that
the
affair
of
the
gold
coin
persistently
avoided
him
while
the
ingenious
wilkins
and
the
young
man
with
spectacles
whom
he
dreaded
seemed
to
have
vanished
from
the
pavements
he
was
pondering
these
problems
one
evening
in
a
house
of
call
in
the
strand
and
the
obstinacy
with
which
the
persons
he
so
ardently
desired
to
meet
hung
back
gave
the
modest
tankard
before
him
an
additional
touch
of
bitter
as
it
happened
he
was
alone
in
his
compartment
and
without
thinking
he
uttered
aloud
the
burden
of
his
meditations
how
bizarre
it
all
is
he
said
a
man
walking
the
pavement
with
the
dread
of
a
young
man
with
spectacles
continually
hovering
before
his
eyes
and
there
was
some
tremendous
feeling
at
work
i
could
swear
to
that
quick
as
thought
before
he
had
finished
the
sentence
a
head
popped
round
the
barrier
and
was
withdrawn
again
and
while
dyson
was
wondering
what
this
could
mean
the
door
of
the
compartment
was
swung
open
and
a
smooth
and
smiling
gentleman
entered
you
will
excuse
me
sir
he
said
politely
for
intruding
on
your
thoughts
but
you
made
a
remark
a
minute
ago
i
did
said
dyson
i
have
been
puzzling
over
a
foolish
matter
and
i
thought
aloud
as
you
heard
what
i
said
and
seem
interested
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
relieve
my
perplexity
indeed
i
scarcely
know
it
is
an
odd
coincidence
one
has
to
be
cautions
i
suppose
sir
that
you
would
have
no
repulsion
in
assisting
the
ends
of
justice
justice
replied
dyson
is
a
term
of
such
wide
meaning
that
i
too
feel
doubtful
about
giving
an
answer
but
this
place
is
not
altogether
fit
for
such
a
discussion
perhaps
you
would
come
to
my
rooms
you
are
very
kind
my
name
is
burton
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
have
not
a
card
with
me
do
you
live
near
here
within
ten
minutes
walk
burton
took
out
his
watch
and
seemed
to
be
making
a
rapid
calculation
i
have
a
train
to
catch
he
said
but
after
all
it
is
a
late
one
so
if
you
do
mind
i
think
i
will
come
with
you
i
am
sure
we
should
have
a
little
talk
together
we
turn
up
here
the
theatres
were
filling
as
they
crossed
the
strand
the
street
seemed
alive
with
voices
and
dyson
looked
fondly
about
him
the
glittering
lines
of
with
here
and
there
the
blinding
radiance
of
an
electric
light
the
hansoms
that
flashed
to
and
fro
with
ringing
bells
the
laden
buses
and
the
eager
hurrying
east
and
west
of
the
foot
passengers
made
his
most
enchanting
picture
and
the
graceful
spire
of
mary
le
strand
on
the
one
hand
and
the
last
flush
of
sunset
on
the
other
were
to
him
a
cause
of
thanksgiving
as
the
gorse
blossom
to
linnæus
burton
caught
his
look
of
fondness
as
they
crossed
the
street
i
see
you
can
find
the
picturesque
in
london
he
said
to
me
this
great
town
is
as
i
see
it
is
to
you
the
study
and
the
love
of
life
yet
how
few
there
are
that
can
pierce
the
veils
of
apparent
monotony
and
meanness
i
have
read
in
a
paper
which
is
said
to
have
the
largest
circulation
in
the
world
a
comparison
between
the
aspects
of
london
and
paris
a
comparison
which
should
be
positively
laureat
as
the
great
masterpiece
of
fatuous
stupidity
conceive
if
you
can
a
human
being
of
ordinary
intelligence
preferring
the
boulevards
to
our
london
streets
imagine
a
man
calling
for
the
wholesale
destruction
of
our
most
charming
city
in
order
that
the
dull
uniformity
of
that
whited
sepulchre
called
paris
should
be
reproduced
here
in
london
is
it
not
positively
incredible
my
dear
sir
said
dyson
regarding
burton
with
a
good
deal
of
interest
i
agree
most
heartily
with
your
opinions
but
i
really
can
not
share
your
wonder
have
you
heard
how
much
george
eliot
received
for
do
you
know
what
the
circulation
of
elsmere
was
do
you
read
bits
regularly
to
me
on
the
contrary
it
is
constant
matter
both
for
wonder
and
thanksgiving
that
london
was
not
boulevardized
twenty
years
ago
i
praise
that
exquisite
jagged
sky
line
that
stands
up
against
the
pale
greens
and
fading
blues
and
flushing
clouds
of
sunset
but
i
wonder
even
more
than
i
praise
as
for
mary
le
strand
its
preservation
is
a
miracle
nothing
more
or
less
a
thing
of
exquisite
beauty
four
buses
abreast
really
the
conclusion
is
too
obvious
did
you
read
the
letter
of
the
man
who
proposed
that
the
whole
mysterious
system
the
immemorial
plan
of
computing
easter
should
be
abolished
because
he
does
like
his
son
having
his
holidays
as
early
as
march
but
shall
we
be
going
on
they
had
lingered
at
the
corner
of
a
street
on
the
north
side
of
the
strand
enjoying
the
contrasts
and
the
glamour
of
the
scene
dyson
pointed
the
way
with
a
gesture
and
they
strolled
up
the
comparatively
deserted
streets
slanting
a
little
to
the
right
and
thus
arriving
at
dyson
lodging
on
the
verge
of
bloomsbury
burton
took
a
comfortable
armchair
by
the
open
window
while
dyson
lit
the
candles
and
produced
the
whiskey
and
soda
and
cigarettes
they
tell
me
these
cigarettes
are
very
good
he
said
but
i
know
nothing
about
it
myself
i
hold
at
last
that
there
is
only
one
tobacco
and
that
is
shag
i
suppose
i
could
not
tempt
you
to
try
a
pipeful
burton
smilingly
refused
the
offer
and
picked
out
a
cigarette
from
the
box
when
he
had
smoked
it
half
through
he
said
with
some
hesitation
it
is
really
kind
of
you
to
have
me
here
dyson
the
fact
is
that
the
interests
at
issue
are
far
too
serious
to
be
discussed
in
a
bar
where
as
you
found
for
yourself
there
may
be
listeners
voluntary
or
involuntary
on
each
side
i
think
the
remark
i
heard
you
make
was
something
about
the
oddity
of
an
individual
going
about
london
in
deadly
fear
of
a
young
man
with
spectacles
yes
that
was
it
well
would
you
mind
confiding
to
me
the
circumstances
that
gave
rise
to
the
reflection
not
in
the
least
it
was
like
this
and
he
ran
over
in
brief
outline
the
adventure
in
oxford
street
dwelling
on
the
violence
of
wilkins
gestures
but
wholly
suppressing
the
tale
told
in
the
café
he
told
me
he
lived
in
constant
terror
of
meeting
this
man
and
i
left
him
when
i
thought
he
was
cool
enough
to
look
after
himself
said
dyson
ending
his
narrative
really
said
burton
and
you
actually
saw
this
mysterious
person
yes
and
could
you
describe
him
well
he
looked
to
me
a
youngish
man
pale
and
nervous
he
had
small
black
side
whiskers
and
wore
rather
large
spectacles
but
this
is
simply
marvellous
you
astonish
me
for
i
must
tell
you
that
my
interest
in
the
matter
is
this
i
am
not
in
the
least
in
terror
of
meeting
a
dark
young
man
with
spectacles
but
i
shrewdly
suspect
a
person
of
that
description
would
much
rather
not
meet
me
and
yet
the
account
you
give
of
the
man
tallies
exactly
a
nervous
glance
to
right
and
left
is
it
not
so
and
as
you
observed
he
wears
prominent
spectacles
and
has
small
black
whiskers
there
can
not
be
surely
two
people
exactly
identical
one
a
cause
of
terror
and
the
other
i
should
imagine
extremely
anxious
to
get
out
of
the
way
but
have
you
seen
this
man
since
no
i
have
not
and
i
have
been
looking
out
for
him
pretty
keenly
but
of
course
he
may
have
left
london
and
england
too
for
the
matter
of
that
hardly
i
think
well
dyson
it
is
only
fair
that
i
should
explain
my
story
now
that
i
have
listened
to
yours
i
must
tell
you
then
that
i
am
an
agent
for
curiosities
and
precious
things
of
all
kinds
an
odd
employment
is
it
of
course
i
was
brought
up
to
the
business
i
gradually
fell
into
it
i
have
always
been
fond
of
things
queer
and
rare
and
by
the
time
i
was
twenty
i
had
made
half
a
dozen
collections
it
is
not
generally
known
how
often
farm
laborers
come
upon
rarities
you
would
be
astonished
if
i
told
you
what
i
have
seen
turned
up
by
the
plough
i
lived
in
the
country
in
those
days
and
i
used
to
buy
anything
the
men
on
the
farms
brought
me
and
i
had
the
queerest
set
of
rubbish
as
my
friends
called
my
collection
but
that
how
i
got
the
scent
of
the
business
which
means
everything
and
later
on
it
struck
me
that
i
might
very
well
turn
my
knowledge
to
account
and
add
to
my
income
since
those
early
days
i
have
been
in
most
quarters
of
the
world
and
some
very
valuable
things
have
passed
through
my
hands
and
i
have
had
to
engage
in
difficult
and
delicate
negotiations
you
have
possibly
heard
of
the
khan
opal
called
in
the
east
stone
of
a
thousand
and
one
colors
well
perhaps
the
conquest
of
that
stone
was
my
greatest
achievement
i
call
it
myself
the
stone
of
the
thousand
and
one
lies
for
i
assure
you
that
i
had
to
invent
a
cycle
of
before
the
rajah
who
owned
it
would
consent
to
sell
the
thing
i
subsidized
wandering
who
told
tales
in
which
the
opal
played
a
frightful
part
i
hired
a
holy
man
a
great
ascetic
to
prophesy
against
the
thing
in
the
language
of
eastern
symbolism
in
short
i
frightened
the
rajah
out
of
his
wits
so
you
see
there
is
room
for
diplomacy
in
the
traffic
i
am
engaged
in
i
have
to
be
ever
on
my
guard
and
i
have
often
been
sensible
that
unless
i
watched
every
step
and
weighed
every
word
my
life
would
not
last
me
much
longer
last
april
i
became
aware
of
the
existence
of
a
highly
valuable
antique
gem
it
was
in
southern
italy
and
in
the
possession
of
persons
who
were
ignorant
of
its
real
value
it
has
always
been
my
experience
that
it
is
precisely
the
ignorant
who
are
most
difficult
to
deal
with
i
have
met
farmers
who
were
under
the
impression
that
a
shilling
of
george
was
a
find
of
almost
incalculable
value
and
all
the
defeats
i
have
sustained
have
been
at
the
hands
of
people
of
this
description
reflecting
on
these
facts
i
saw
that
the
acquisition
of
the
gem
i
have
mentioned
would
be
an
affair
demanding
the
nicest
diplomacy
i
might
possibly
have
got
it
by
offering
a
sum
approaching
its
real
value
but
i
need
not
point
out
to
you
that
such
a
proceeding
would
be
most
unbusinesslike
indeed
i
doubt
whether
it
would
have
been
successful
for
the
cupidity
of
such
persons
is
aroused
by
a
sum
which
seems
enormous
and
the
low
cunning
which
serves
them
in
place
of
intelligence
immediately
suggests
that
the
object
for
which
such
an
amount
is
offered
must
be
worth
at
least
double
of
course
when
it
is
a
matter
of
an
ordinary
curiosity
an
old
jug
a
carved
chest
or
a
queer
brass
lantern
one
does
not
much
care
the
cupidity
of
the
owner
defeats
its
object
the
collector
laughs
and
goes
away
for
he
is
aware
that
such
things
are
by
no
means
unique
but
this
gem
i
fervently
desired
to
possess
and
as
i
did
not
see
my
way
to
giving
more
than
a
hundredth
part
of
its
value
i
was
conscious
that
all
my
let
us
say
imaginative
and
diplomatic
powers
would
have
to
be
exerted
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
could
not
undertake
to
carry
the
matter
through
and
i
determined
to
confide
in
my
assistant
a
young
man
named
william
robbins
whom
i
judged
to
be
by
no
means
devoid
of
capacity
my
idea
was
that
robbins
should
get
himself
up
as
a
dealer
in
precious
stones
he
could
patter
a
little
italian
and
would
go
to
the
town
in
question
and
manage
to
see
the
gem
we
were
after
possibly
by
offering
some
trifling
articles
of
jewelry
for
sale
but
that
i
left
to
be
decided
then
my
work
was
to
begin
but
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
a
tale
told
twice
over
in
due
course
then
robbins
went
off
to
italy
with
an
assortment
of
uncut
stones
and
a
few
rings
and
some
jewelry
i
bought
in
birmingham
on
purpose
for
his
expedition
a
week
later
i
followed
him
travelling
leisurely
so
that
i
was
a
fortnight
later
in
arriving
at
our
common
destination
there
was
a
decent
hotel
in
the
town
and
on
my
inquiring
of
the
landlord
whether
there
were
many
strangers
in
the
place
he
told
me
very
few
he
had
heard
there
was
an
englishman
staying
in
a
small
tavern
a
pedlar
he
said
who
sold
beautiful
trinkets
very
cheaply
and
wanted
to
buy
old
rubbish
for
five
or
six
days
i
took
life
leisurely
and
i
must
say
i
enjoyed
myself
it
was
part
of
my
plan
to
make
the
people
think
i
was
an
enormously
rich
man
and
i
knew
that
such
items
as
the
extravagance
of
my
meals
and
the
price
of
every
bottle
of
wine
i
drank
would
not
be
suffered
as
sancho
panza
puts
it
to
rot
in
the
landlord
breast
at
the
end
of
the
week
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
signor
melini
the
owner
of
the
gem
i
coveted
at
the
café
and
with
his
ready
hospitality
and
my
geniality
i
was
soon
established
as
a
friend
of
the
house
on
my
third
or
fourth
visit
i
managed
to
make
the
italians
talk
about
the
english
pedlar
who
they
said
spoke
a
most
detestable
italian
that
does
not
matter
said
the
signora
melini
he
has
beautiful
things
which
he
sells
very
very
cheap
hope
you
may
not
find
he
has
cheated
you
i
said
i
must
tell
you
that
english
people
give
these
fellows
a
very
wide
berth
they
usually
make
a
great
parade
of
the
cheapness
of
their
goods
which
often
turn
out
to
be
double
the
price
of
better
articles
in
the
shops
they
would
not
hear
of
this
and
signora
melini
insisted
on
showing
me
the
three
rings
and
the
bracelet
she
had
bought
of
the
pedlar
she
told
me
the
price
she
had
paid
and
after
scrutinizing
the
articles
carefully
i
had
to
confess
that
she
had
made
a
bargain
and
indeed
robbins
had
sold
her
the
things
at
about
fifty
per
cent
below
market
value
i
admired
the
trinkets
as
i
gave
them
back
to
the
lady
and
i
hinted
that
the
pedlar
must
be
a
somewhat
foolish
specimen
of
his
class
two
days
later
as
i
was
taking
my
vermouth
at
the
café
with
signor
melini
he
led
the
conversation
back
to
the
pedlar
and
mentioned
casually
that
he
had
shown
the
man
a
little
curiosity
for
which
he
had
made
rather
a
handsome
offer
dear
sir
i
said
hope
you
will
be
careful
i
told
you
that
the
travelling
tradesman
does
not
bear
a
very
high
reputation
in
england
and
notwithstanding
his
apparent
simplicity
this
fellow
may
turn
out
to
be
an
arrant
cheat
may
i
ask
you
what
is
the
nature
of
the
curiosity
you
have
shown
him
he
told
me
it
was
a
little
thing
a
pretty
little
stone
with
some
figures
cut
on
it
people
said
it
was
old
should
like
to
examine
it
i
replied
it
happens
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
these
gems
we
have
a
fine
collection
of
them
in
our
museum
at
london
in
due
course
i
was
shown
the
article
and
i
held
the
gem
i
so
coveted
between
my
fingers
i
looked
at
it
coolly
and
put
it
down
carelessly
on
the
table
you
mind
telling
me
signor
i
said
much
my
offered
you
for
this
he
said
wife
says
the
man
must
be
mad
he
said
he
would
give
me
twenty
lire
for
it
i
looked
at
him
quietly
and
took
up
the
gem
and
pretended
to
examine
it
in
the
light
more
carefully
i
turned
it
over
and
over
and
finally
pulled
out
a
magnifying
glass
from
my
pocket
and
seemed
to
search
every
line
in
the
cutting
with
minutest
scrutiny
dear
sir
i
said
at
last
am
inclined
to
agree
with
signora
melini
if
this
gem
were
genuine
it
would
be
worth
some
money
but
as
it
happens
to
be
a
rather
bad
forgery
it
is
not
worth
twenty
centesimi
it
was
sophisticated
i
should
imagine
some
time
in
the
last
century
and
by
a
very
unskilful
hand
we
had
better
get
rid
of
it
said
melini
never
thought
it
was
worth
anything
myself
of
course
i
am
sorry
for
the
pedlar
but
one
must
let
a
man
know
his
own
trade
i
shall
tell
him
we
will
take
the
twenty
lire
me
i
said
man
wants
a
lesson
it
would
be
a
charity
to
give
him
one
tell
him
that
you
will
not
take
anything
under
eighty
lire
and
i
shall
be
much
surprised
if
he
does
not
close
with
you
at
once
a
day
or
two
later
i
heard
that
the
english
pedlar
had
gone
away
after
debasing
the
minds
of
the
country
people
with
birmingham
art
jewelry
for
i
admit
that
the
gold
sleeve
links
like
kidney
beans
the
silver
chains
made
apparently
after
the
pattern
of
a
and
the
initial
brooches
have
always
been
heavy
on
my
conscience
i
can
not
acquit
myself
of
having
indirectly
contributed
to
debauch
the
taste
of
a
simple
folk
but
i
hope
that
the
end
i
had
in
view
may
finally
outbalance
this
heavy
charge
soon
afterwards
i
paid
a
farewell
visit
at
the
melinis
and
the
signor
informed
me
with
an
oily
chuckle
that
the
plan
i
had
suggested
had
been
completely
successful
i
congratulated
him
on
his
bargain
and
went
away
after
expressing
a
wish
that
heaven
might
send
many
such
pedlars
in
his
path
nothing
of
interest
occurred
on
my
return
journey
i
had
arranged
that
robbins
was
to
meet
me
at
a
certain
place
on
a
certain
day
and
i
went
to
the
appointment
full
of
the
coolest
confidence
the
gem
had
been
conquered
and
i
had
only
to
reap
the
fruits
of
victory
i
am
sorry
to
shake
that
trust
in
our
common
human
nature
which
i
am
sure
you
possess
but
i
am
compelled
to
tell
you
that
up
to
the
present
date
i
have
never
set
eyes
on
my
man
robbins
or
on
the
antique
gem
in
his
custody
i
have
found
out
that
he
actually
arrived
in
london
for
he
was
seen
three
days
before
my
arrival
in
england
by
a
pawnbroker
of
my
acquaintance
consuming
his
favorite
beverage
four
ale
in
the
tavern
where
we
met
since
then
he
has
not
been
heard
of
i
hope
you
will
now
pardon
my
curiosity
as
to
the
history
and
adventures
of
dark
young
men
with
spectacles
you
will
i
am
sure
feel
for
me
in
my
position
the
savor
of
life
has
disappeared
for
me
it
is
a
bitter
thought
that
i
have
rescued
one
of
the
most
perfect
and
exquisite
specimens
of
antique
art
from
the
hands
of
ignorant
and
indeed
unscrupulous
persons
only
to
deliver
it
into
the
keeping
of
a
man
who
is
evidently
utterly
devoid
of
the
very
elements
of
commercial
morality
my
dear
sir
said
dyson
you
will
allow
me
to
compliment
you
on
your
style
your
adventures
have
interested
me
exceedingly
but
forgive
me
you
just
now
used
the
word
morality
would
not
some
persons
take
exception
to
your
own
methods
of
business
i
can
conceive
myself
flaws
of
a
moral
kind
being
found
in
the
very
original
conception
you
have
described
to
me
i
can
imagine
the
puritan
shrinking
in
dismay
from
your
scheme
pronouncing
it
unscrupulous
nay
dishonest
burton
helped
himself
very
frankly
to
some
more
whiskey
your
scruples
entertain
me
he
said
perhaps
you
have
not
gone
very
deeply
into
these
questions
of
ethics
i
have
been
compelled
to
do
so
myself
just
as
i
was
forced
to
master
a
simple
system
of
without
and
still
more
without
a
system
of
ethics
it
is
impossible
to
conduct
a
business
such
as
mine
but
i
assure
you
that
i
am
often
profoundly
saddened
as
i
pass
through
the
crowded
streets
and
watch
the
world
at
work
by
the
thought
of
how
few
amongst
all
these
hurrying
individuals
black
hatted
well
dressed
educated
we
may
presume
sufficiently
how
few
amongst
them
have
any
reasoned
system
of
morality
even
you
have
not
weighed
the
question
although
you
study
life
and
affairs
and
to
a
certain
extent
penetrate
the
veils
and
masks
of
the
comedy
of
man
even
you
judge
by
empty
conventions
and
the
false
money
which
is
allowed
to
pass
current
as
sterling
coin
allow
me
to
play
the
part
of
socrates
i
shall
teach
you
nothing
that
you
do
not
know
i
shall
merely
lay
aside
the
wrappings
of
prejudice
and
bad
logic
and
show
you
the
real
image
which
you
possess
in
your
soul
come
then
do
you
allow
that
happiness
is
anything
certainly
said
dyson
and
happiness
is
desirable
or
undesirable
desirable
of
course
and
what
shall
we
call
the
man
who
gives
happiness
is
he
not
a
philanthropist
i
think
so
and
such
a
person
is
praiseworthy
and
the
more
praiseworthy
in
the
proportion
of
the
persons
whom
he
makes
happy
by
all
means
so
that
he
who
makes
a
whole
nation
happy
is
praiseworthy
in
the
extreme
and
the
action
by
which
he
gives
happiness
is
the
highest
virtue
it
appears
so
o
burton
said
dyson
who
found
something
very
exquisite
in
the
character
of
his
visitor
quite
so
you
find
the
several
conclusions
inevitable
well
apply
them
to
the
story
i
have
told
you
i
conferred
happiness
on
myself
by
obtaining
as
i
thought
possession
of
the
gem
i
conferred
happiness
on
the
melinis
by
getting
them
eighty
lire
instead
of
an
object
for
which
they
had
not
the
slightest
value
and
i
intended
to
confer
happiness
on
the
whole
british
nation
by
selling
the
thing
to
the
british
museum
to
say
nothing
of
the
happiness
a
profit
of
about
nine
thousand
per
cent
would
have
conferred
on
me
i
assure
you
i
regard
robbins
as
an
interferer
with
the
cosmos
and
fair
order
of
things
but
that
is
nothing
you
perceive
that
i
am
an
apostle
of
the
very
highest
morality
you
have
been
forced
to
yield
to
argument
there
certainly
seems
a
great
deal
in
what
you
advance
said
dyson
i
admit
that
i
am
a
mere
amateur
of
ethics
while
you
as
you
say
have
brought
the
most
acute
scrutiny
to
bear
on
these
perplexed
and
doubtful
questions
i
can
well
understand
your
anxiety
to
meet
the
fallacious
robbins
and
i
congratulate
myself
on
the
chance
which
has
made
us
acquainted
but
you
will
pardon
my
seeming
inhospitality
i
see
it
is
half
past
eleven
and
i
think
you
mentioned
a
train
a
thousand
thanks
dyson
i
have
just
time
i
see
i
will
look
you
up
some
evening
if
i
may
the
decorative
imagination
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
dyson
became
accustomed
to
the
constant
incursions
of
the
ingenious
burton
who
showed
himself
ready
to
drop
in
at
all
hours
not
averse
to
refreshment
and
a
profound
guide
in
the
complicated
questions
of
life
his
visits
at
once
terrified
and
delighted
dyson
who
could
no
longer
seat
himself
at
his
bureau
secure
from
interruption
while
he
embarked
on
literary
undertakings
each
one
of
which
was
to
be
a
masterpiece
on
the
other
hand
it
was
a
vivid
pleasure
to
be
confronted
with
views
so
highly
original
and
if
here
and
there
burton
reasonings
seemed
tinged
with
fallacy
yet
dyson
freely
yielded
to
the
joy
of
strangeness
and
never
failed
to
give
his
visitor
a
frank
and
hearty
welcome
burton
first
inquiry
was
always
after
the
unprincipled
robbins
and
he
seemed
to
feel
the
stings
of
disappointment
when
dyson
told
him
that
he
had
failed
to
meet
this
outrage
on
all
morality
as
burton
styled
him
vowing
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
take
vengeance
on
such
a
shameless
betrayal
of
trust
one
evening
they
had
sat
together
for
some
time
discussing
the
possibility
of
laying
down
for
this
present
generation
and
our
modern
and
intensely
complicated
order
of
society
some
rules
of
social
diplomacy
such
as
lord
bacon
gave
to
the
courtiers
of
king
james
i
it
is
a
book
to
make
said
burton
but
who
is
there
capable
of
making
it
i
tell
you
people
are
longing
for
such
a
book
it
would
bring
fortune
to
its
publisher
bacon
essays
are
exquisite
but
they
have
now
no
practical
application
the
modern
strategist
can
find
but
little
use
in
a
treatise
re
militari
written
by
a
florentine
in
the
fifteenth
century
scarcely
more
dissimilar
are
the
social
conditions
of
bacon
time
and
our
own
the
rules
that
he
lays
down
so
exquisitely
for
the
courtier
and
diplomatist
of
james
the
first
age
will
avail
us
little
in
the
struggle
of
life
i
am
afraid
has
deteriorated
it
gives
little
play
for
fine
strokes
such
as
formerly
advanced
men
in
the
state
except
in
such
businesses
as
mine
where
a
chance
does
occur
now
and
then
it
has
all
become
as
i
said
an
affair
of
rough
and
tumble
men
still
desire
to
attain
it
is
true
but
what
is
their
de
a
mere
imitation
and
not
a
gracious
one
of
the
arts
of
the
and
the
proprietor
of
baking
powder
when
i
think
of
these
things
my
dear
dyson
i
confess
that
i
am
tempted
to
despair
of
my
century
you
are
too
pessimistic
my
dear
fellow
you
set
up
too
high
a
standard
certainly
i
agree
with
you
that
the
times
are
decadent
in
many
ways
i
admit
a
general
appearance
of
squalor
it
needs
much
philosophy
to
extract
the
wonderful
and
the
beautiful
from
the
cromwell
road
or
the
nonconformist
conscience
australian
wines
of
fine
burgundy
character
the
novels
alike
of
the
old
women
and
the
new
women
popular
journalism
these
things
indeed
make
for
depression
yet
we
have
our
advantages
before
us
is
unfolded
the
greatest
spectacle
the
world
has
ever
seen
the
mystery
of
the
innumerable
unending
streets
the
strange
adventures
that
must
infallibly
arise
from
so
complicated
a
press
of
interests
nay
i
will
say
that
he
who
has
stood
in
the
ways
of
a
suburb
and
has
seen
them
stretch
before
him
all
shining
void
and
desolate
at
noonday
has
not
lived
in
vain
such
a
sight
is
in
reality
more
wonderful
than
any
perspective
of
bagdad
or
grand
cairo
and
to
set
on
one
side
the
entertaining
history
of
the
gem
which
you
told
me
surely
you
must
have
had
many
singular
adventures
in
your
own
career
perhaps
not
so
many
as
you
would
think
a
good
deal
the
larger
part
of
my
business
has
been
as
commonplace
as
but
of
course
things
happen
now
and
then
it
is
ten
years
since
i
have
established
my
agency
and
i
suppose
that
a
house
and
estate
agent
who
had
been
in
trade
for
an
equal
time
could
tell
you
some
queer
stories
but
i
must
give
you
a
sample
of
my
experiences
some
night
why
not
said
dyson
this
evening
seems
to
me
admirably
adapted
for
an
odd
chapter
look
out
into
the
street
you
can
catch
a
view
of
it
if
you
crane
your
neck
from
that
chair
of
yours
is
it
not
charming
the
double
row
of
lamps
growing
closer
in
the
distance
the
hazy
outline
of
the
in
the
square
and
the
lights
of
the
hansoms
swimming
to
and
fro
gliding
and
vanishing
and
above
the
sky
all
clear
and
blue
and
shining
come
let
us
have
one
of
your
nouvelles
my
dear
dyson
i
am
delighted
to
amuse
you
with
these
words
burton
prefaced
the
novel
of
the
iron
maid
i
think
the
most
extraordinary
event
which
i
can
recall
took
place
about
five
years
ago
i
was
then
still
feeling
my
way
i
had
declared
for
business
and
attended
regularly
at
my
office
but
i
had
not
succeeded
in
establishing
a
really
profitable
connection
and
consequently
i
had
a
good
deal
of
leisure
time
on
my
hands
i
have
never
thought
fit
to
trouble
you
with
the
details
of
my
private
life
they
would
be
entirely
devoid
of
interest
i
must
briefly
say
however
that
i
had
a
numerous
circle
of
acquaintance
and
was
never
at
a
loss
as
to
how
to
spend
my
evenings
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
have
friends
in
most
of
the
ranks
of
the
social
order
there
is
nothing
so
unfortunate
to
my
mind
as
a
specialized
circle
wherein
a
certain
round
of
ideas
is
continually
traversed
and
retraversed
i
have
always
tried
to
find
out
new
types
and
persons
whose
brains
contained
something
fresh
to
me
one
may
chance
to
gain
information
even
from
the
conversation
of
city
men
on
an
omnibus
amongst
my
acquaintance
i
knew
a
young
doctor
who
lived
in
a
far
outlying
suburb
and
i
used
often
to
brave
the
intolerably
slow
railway
journey
to
have
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
his
talk
one
night
we
conversed
so
eagerly
together
over
our
pipes
and
whiskey
that
the
clock
passed
unnoticed
and
when
i
glanced
up
i
realized
with
a
shock
that
i
had
just
five
minutes
in
which
to
catch
the
last
tram
i
made
a
dash
for
my
hat
and
stick
and
jumped
out
of
the
house
and
down
the
steps
and
tore
at
full
speed
up
the
street
it
was
no
good
however
there
was
a
shriek
of
the
engine
whistle
and
i
stood
there
at
the
station
door
and
saw
far
on
the
long
dark
line
of
the
embankment
a
red
light
shine
and
vanish
and
a
porter
came
down
and
shut
the
door
with
a
bang
how
far
to
london
i
asked
him
a
good
nine
miles
to
waterloo
bridge
and
with
that
he
went
off
before
me
was
the
long
suburban
street
its
dreary
distance
marked
by
rows
of
twinkling
lamps
and
the
air
was
poisoned
by
the
faint
sickly
smell
of
burning
bricks
it
was
not
a
cheerful
prospect
by
any
means
and
i
had
to
walk
through
nine
miles
of
such
streets
deserted
as
those
of
pompeii
i
knew
pretty
well
what
direction
to
take
so
i
set
out
wearily
looking
at
the
stretch
of
lamps
vanishing
in
perspective
and
as
i
walked
street
after
street
branched
off
to
right
and
left
some
far
reaching
to
distances
that
seemed
endless
communicating
with
other
systems
of
thoroughfare
and
some
mere
protoplasmic
streets
beginning
in
orderly
fashion
with
serried
houses
and
ending
suddenly
in
waste
and
pits
and
rubbish
heaps
and
fields
whence
the
magic
had
departed
i
have
spoken
of
systems
of
thoroughfare
and
i
assure
you
that
walking
alone
through
these
silent
places
i
felt
phantasy
growing
on
me
and
some
glamour
of
the
infinite
there
was
here
i
felt
an
immensity
as
in
the
outer
void
of
the
universe
i
passed
from
unknown
to
unknown
my
way
marked
by
lamps
like
stars
and
on
either
band
was
an
unknown
world
where
myriads
of
men
dwelt
and
slept
street
leading
into
street
as
it
seemed
to
world
end
at
first
the
road
by
which
i
was
travelling
was
lined
with
houses
of
unutterable
monotony
a
wall
of
gray
brick
pierced
by
two
stories
of
windows
drawn
close
to
the
very
pavement
but
by
degrees
i
noticed
an
improvement
there
were
gardens
and
these
grew
larger
the
suburban
builder
began
to
allow
himself
a
wider
scope
and
for
a
certain
distance
each
flight
of
steps
was
guarded
by
twin
lions
of
plaster
and
scents
of
flowers
prevailed
over
the
fume
of
heated
bricks
the
road
began
to
climb
a
hill
and
looking
up
a
side
street
i
saw
the
half
moon
rise
over
and
there
on
the
other
side
was
as
if
a
white
cloud
had
fallen
and
the
air
around
it
was
sweetened
as
with
incense
it
was
a
in
full
bloom
i
pressed
on
stubbornly
listening
for
the
wheels
and
the
clatter
of
some
belated
hansom
but
into
that
land
of
men
who
go
to
the
city
in
the
morning
and
return
in
the
evening
the
hansom
rarely
enters
and
i
had
resigned
myself
once
more
to
the
walk
when
i
suddenly
became
aware
that
some
one
was
advancing
to
meet
me
along
the
sidewalk
the
man
was
strolling
rather
aimlessly
and
though
the
time
and
the
place
would
have
allowed
an
unconventional
style
of
dress
he
was
vested
in
the
ordinary
frock
coat
black
tie
and
silk
hat
of
civilization
we
met
each
other
under
the
lamp
and
as
often
happens
in
this
great
town
two
casual
passengers
brought
face
to
face
found
each
in
the
other
an
acquaintance
mathias
i
think
i
said
quite
so
and
you
are
frank
burton
you
know
you
are
a
man
with
a
christian
name
so
i
wo
apologize
for
my
familiarity
but
may
i
ask
where
you
are
going
i
explained
the
situation
to
him
saying
i
had
traversed
a
region
as
unknown
to
me
as
the
darkest
recesses
of
africa
i
think
i
have
only
about
five
miles
farther
i
concluded
nonsense
you
must
come
home
with
me
my
house
is
close
by
in
fact
i
was
just
taking
my
evening
walk
when
we
met
come
along
i
dare
say
you
will
find
a
makeshift
bed
easier
than
a
walk
i
let
him
take
my
arm
and
lead
me
along
though
i
was
a
good
deal
surprised
at
so
much
geniality
from
a
man
who
was
after
all
a
mere
casual
club
acquaintance
i
suppose
i
had
not
spoken
to
mathias
times
he
was
a
man
who
would
sit
silent
in
an
armchair
for
hours
neither
reading
nor
smoking
but
now
and
again
moistening
his
lips
with
his
tongue
and
smiling
queerly
to
himself
i
confess
he
had
never
attracted
me
and
on
the
whole
i
should
have
preferred
to
continue
my
walk
but
he
took
my
arm
and
led
me
up
a
side
street
and
stopped
at
a
door
in
a
high
wall
we
passed
through
the
still
moonlit
garden
beneath
the
black
shadow
of
an
old
cedar
and
into
an
old
red
brick
house
with
many
gables
i
was
tired
enough
and
i
sighed
with
relief
as
i
let
myself
fall
into
a
great
leather
armchair
you
know
the
infernal
grit
with
which
they
strew
the
sidewalk
in
those
suburban
districts
it
makes
walking
a
penance
and
i
felt
my
tramp
had
made
me
more
weary
than
ten
miles
on
an
honest
country
road
i
looked
about
the
room
with
some
curiosity
there
was
a
shaded
lamp
which
threw
a
circle
of
brilliant
light
on
a
heap
of
papers
lying
on
an
old
secretaire
of
the
last
century
but
the
room
was
all
vague
and
shadowy
and
i
could
only
see
that
it
was
long
and
low
and
that
it
was
filled
with
indistinct
objects
which
might
be
furniture
mathias
sat
down
in
a
second
armchair
and
looked
about
him
with
that
odd
smile
of
his
he
was
a
man
and
white
to
the
lips
i
should
think
his
age
was
something
between
fifty
and
sixty
now
i
have
got
you
here
he
began
i
must
inflict
my
hobby
on
you
you
knew
i
was
a
collector
oh
yes
i
have
devoted
many
years
to
collecting
curiosities
which
i
think
are
really
curious
but
we
must
have
a
better
light
he
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
lit
a
lamp
which
hung
from
the
ceiling
and
as
the
bright
light
flashed
round
the
wick
from
every
corner
and
space
there
seemed
to
start
a
horror
great
wooden
frames
with
complicated
apparatus
of
ropes
and
pulleys
stood
against
the
wall
a
wheel
of
strange
shape
had
a
place
beside
a
thing
that
looked
like
a
gigantic
gridiron
little
tables
glittered
with
bright
steel
instruments
carelessly
put
down
as
if
ready
for
use
a
screw
and
vice
loomed
out
casting
ugly
shadows
and
in
another
nook
was
a
saw
with
cruel
jagged
teeth
yes
said
mathias
they
are
as
you
suggest
instruments
of
torture
of
torture
and
death
some
many
i
may
say
have
been
used
a
few
are
reproductions
after
ancient
examples
those
knives
were
used
for
flaying
that
frame
is
a
rack
and
a
very
fine
specimen
look
at
this
it
comes
from
venice
you
see
that
sort
of
collar
something
like
a
big
well
the
patient
let
us
call
him
sat
down
quite
comfortably
and
the
was
neatly
fitted
round
his
neck
then
the
two
ends
were
joined
with
a
silken
band
and
the
executioner
began
to
turn
a
handle
connected
with
the
band
the
contracted
very
gradually
as
the
band
tightened
and
the
turning
continued
till
the
man
was
strangled
it
all
took
place
quietly
in
one
of
those
queer
garrets
under
the
leads
but
these
things
are
all
european
the
orientals
are
of
course
much
more
ingenious
these
are
the
chinese
contrivances
you
have
heard
of
the
death
it
is
my
hobby
this
sort
of
thing
do
you
know
i
often
sit
here
hour
after
hour
and
meditate
over
the
collection
i
fancy
i
see
the
faces
of
the
men
who
have
suffered
faces
lean
with
agony
and
wet
with
sweats
of
death
growing
distinct
out
of
the
gloom
and
i
hear
the
echoes
of
their
cries
for
mercy
but
i
must
show
you
my
latest
acquisition
come
into
the
next
room
i
followed
mathias
out
the
weariness
of
the
walk
the
late
hour
and
the
strangeness
of
it
all
made
me
feel
like
a
man
in
a
dream
nothing
would
have
surprised
me
very
much
the
second
room
was
as
the
first
crowded
with
ghastly
instruments
but
beneath
the
lamp
was
a
wooden
platform
and
a
figure
stood
on
it
it
was
a
large
statue
of
a
naked
woman
fashioned
in
green
bronze
the
arms
were
stretched
out
and
there
was
a
smile
on
the
lips
it
might
well
have
been
intended
for
a
venus
and
yet
there
was
about
the
thing
an
evil
and
a
deadly
look
mathias
looked
at
it
complacently
quite
a
work
of
art
is
it
he
said
it
made
of
bronze
as
you
see
but
it
has
long
had
the
name
of
the
iron
maid
i
got
it
from
germany
and
it
was
only
unpacked
this
afternoon
indeed
i
have
not
yet
had
time
to
open
the
letter
of
advice
you
see
that
very
small
knob
between
the
breasts
well
the
victim
was
bound
to
the
maid
the
knob
was
pressed
and
the
arms
slowly
tightened
round
the
neck
you
can
imagine
the
result
as
mathias
talked
he
patted
the
figure
affectionately
i
had
turned
away
for
i
sickened
at
the
sight
of
the
man
and
his
loathsome
treasure
there
was
a
slight
click
of
which
i
took
no
notice
it
was
not
much
louder
than
the
tick
of
a
clock
and
then
i
heard
a
sudden
whir
the
noise
of
machinery
in
motion
and
i
faced
round
i
have
never
forgotten
the
hideous
agony
on
mathias
face
as
those
relentless
arms
tightened
about
his
neck
there
was
a
wild
struggle
as
of
a
beast
in
the
toils
and
then
a
shriek
that
ended
in
a
choking
groan
the
whirring
noise
had
suddenly
changed
into
a
heavy
droning
i
tore
with
all
my
might
at
the
bronze
arms
and
strove
to
wrench
them
apart
but
i
could
do
nothing
the
head
had
slowly
bent
down
and
the
green
lips
were
on
the
lips
of
mathias
of
course
i
had
to
attend
at
the
inquest
the
letter
which
had
accompanied
the
figure
was
found
unopened
on
the
study
table
the
german
firm
of
dealers
cautioned
their
client
to
be
most
careful
in
touching
the
iron
maid
as
the
machinery
had
been
put
in
thorough
working
order
for
many
revolving
weeks
burton
delighted
dyson
by
his
agreeable
conversation
diversified
by
anecdote
and
interspersed
with
the
narration
of
singular
adventures
finally
however
he
vanished
as
suddenly
as
he
had
appeared
and
on
the
occasion
of
his
last
visit
he
contrived
to
loot
a
copy
of
his
namesake
anatomy
dyson
considering
this
violent
attack
on
the
rights
of
property
and
certain
glaring
inconsistencies
in
the
talk
of
his
late
friend
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
his
stories
were
fabulous
and
that
the
iron
maid
only
existed
in
the
sphere
of
a
decorative
imagination
the
recluse
of
bayswater
amongst
the
many
friends
who
were
favored
with
the
occasional
pleasure
of
dyson
society
was
edgar
russell
realist
and
obscure
struggler
who
occupied
a
small
back
room
on
the
second
floor
of
a
house
in
abingdon
grove
notting
hill
turning
off
from
the
main
street
and
walking
a
few
paces
onward
one
was
conscious
of
a
certain
calm
a
drowsy
peace
which
made
the
feet
inclined
to
loiter
and
this
was
ever
the
atmosphere
of
abingdon
grove
the
houses
stood
a
little
back
with
gardens
where
the
lilac
and
laburnum
and
may
blossomed
gayly
in
their
seasons
and
there
was
a
corner
where
an
older
house
in
another
street
had
managed
to
keep
a
back
garden
of
real
extent
a
garden
whence
there
came
a
pleasant
scent
of
greenness
after
the
rains
of
early
summer
where
old
elms
held
memories
of
the
open
fields
where
there
was
yet
sweet
grass
to
walk
on
the
houses
in
abingdon
grove
belonged
chiefly
to
the
nondescript
stucco
period
of
years
ago
tolerably
built
with
passable
accommodation
for
moderate
incomes
they
had
largely
passed
into
the
state
of
lodgings
and
cards
bearing
the
inscription
furnished
apartments
were
not
infrequent
over
the
doors
here
then
in
a
house
of
sufficiently
good
appearance
russell
had
established
himself
for
he
looked
upon
the
traditional
dirt
and
squalor
of
grub
street
as
a
false
and
obsolete
convention
and
preferred
as
he
said
to
live
within
sight
of
green
leaves
indeed
from
his
room
one
had
a
magnificent
view
of
a
long
line
of
gardens
and
a
screen
of
poplars
shut
out
the
melancholy
back
premises
of
wilton
street
during
the
summer
months
russell
lived
chiefly
on
bread
and
tea
for
his
means
were
of
the
smallest
but
when
dyson
came
to
see
him
he
would
send
out
the
slavey
for
and
dyson
was
always
at
liberty
to
smoke
as
much
of
his
own
tobacco
as
he
pleased
the
landlady
had
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
her
floor
vacant
for
many
months
a
card
had
long
proclaimed
the
void
within
and
dyson
when
he
walked
up
the
steps
one
evening
in
early
autumn
had
a
sense
that
something
was
missing
and
looking
at
the
fanlight
saw
the
appealing
card
had
disappeared
you
have
let
your
first
floor
have
you
he
said
as
he
greeted
russell
yes
it
was
taken
about
a
fortnight
ago
by
a
lady
indeed
said
dyson
always
curious
a
young
lady
yes
i
believe
so
she
is
a
widow
and
wears
a
thick
crape
veil
i
have
met
her
once
or
twice
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
street
but
i
should
not
know
her
face
well
said
dyson
when
the
beer
had
arrived
and
the
pipes
were
in
full
blast
and
what
have
you
been
doing
do
you
find
the
work
getting
any
easier
alas
said
the
young
man
with
an
expression
of
great
gloom
the
life
is
a
purgatory
and
all
but
a
hell
i
write
picking
out
my
words
weighing
and
balancing
the
force
of
every
syllable
calculating
the
minutest
effects
that
language
can
produce
erasing
and
rewriting
and
spending
a
whole
evening
over
a
page
of
manuscript
and
then
in
the
morning
when
i
read
what
i
have
written
well
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
throw
it
in
the
basket
if
the
verso
has
been
already
written
on
or
to
put
it
in
the
drawer
if
the
other
side
happens
to
be
clean
when
i
have
written
a
phrase
which
undoubtedly
embodies
a
happy
turn
of
thought
i
find
it
dressed
up
in
feeble
commonplace
and
when
the
style
is
good
it
serves
only
to
conceal
the
baldness
of
superannuated
fancies
i
sweat
over
my
work
dyson
every
finished
line
means
so
much
agony
i
envy
the
lot
of
the
carpenter
in
the
side
street
who
has
a
craft
which
he
understands
when
he
gets
an
order
for
a
table
he
does
not
writhe
with
anguish
but
if
i
were
so
unlucky
as
to
get
an
order
for
a
book
i
think
i
should
go
mad
my
dear
fellow
you
take
it
all
too
seriously
you
should
let
the
ink
flow
more
readily
above
all
firmly
believe
when
you
sit
down
to
write
that
you
are
an
artist
and
that
whatever
you
are
about
is
a
masterpiece
suppose
ideas
fail
you
say
as
i
heard
one
of
our
most
exquisite
artists
say
it
of
no
consequence
the
ideas
are
all
there
at
the
bottom
of
that
box
of
cigarettes
you
indeed
smoke
tobacco
but
the
application
is
the
same
besides
you
must
have
some
happy
moments
and
these
should
be
ample
consolation
perhaps
you
are
right
but
such
moments
are
so
few
and
then
there
is
the
torture
of
a
glorious
conception
matched
with
execution
beneath
the
standard
of
the
family
story
paper
for
instance
i
was
happy
for
two
hours
a
night
or
two
ago
i
lay
awake
and
saw
visions
but
then
the
morning
what
was
your
idea
it
seemed
to
me
a
splendid
one
i
thought
of
balzac
and
the
humaine
of
zola
and
the
family
it
dawned
upon
me
that
i
would
write
the
history
of
a
street
every
house
should
form
a
volume
i
fixed
upon
the
street
i
saw
each
house
and
read
as
clearly
as
in
letters
the
physiology
and
psychology
of
each
the
little
stretched
before
me
in
its
actual
shape
a
street
that
i
know
and
have
passed
down
a
hundred
times
with
some
twenty
houses
prosperous
and
mean
and
lilac
bushes
in
purple
blossom
and
yet
it
was
at
the
same
time
a
symbol
a
of
hopes
cherished
and
disappointed
of
years
of
monotonous
existence
without
content
or
discontent
of
tragedies
and
obscure
sorrows
and
on
the
door
of
one
of
those
houses
i
saw
the
red
stain
of
blood
and
behind
a
window
two
shadows
blackened
and
faded
on
the
blind
as
they
swayed
on
tightened
cords
the
shadows
of
a
man
and
a
woman
hanging
in
a
vulgar
parlor
these
were
my
fancies
but
when
pen
touched
paper
they
shrivelled
and
vanished
away
yes
said
dyson
there
is
a
lot
in
that
i
envy
you
the
pains
of
transmuting
vision
into
reality
and
still
more
i
envy
you
the
day
when
you
will
look
at
your
bookshelf
and
see
twenty
goodly
books
upon
the
shelves
the
series
complete
and
done
forever
let
me
entreat
you
to
have
them
bound
in
solid
parchment
with
gold
lettering
it
is
the
only
real
cover
for
a
valiant
book
when
i
look
in
at
the
windows
of
some
choice
shop
and
see
the
bindings
of
levant
morocco
with
pretty
tools
and
panellings
and
your
sweet
contrasts
of
red
and
green
i
say
to
myself
are
not
books
but
bibelots
a
book
bound
so
a
true
book
mind
you
is
like
a
gothic
statue
draped
in
brocade
of
lyons
alas
said
russell
we
need
not
discuss
the
binding
the
books
are
not
begun
the
talk
went
on
as
usual
till
eleven
when
dyson
bade
his
friend
he
knew
the
way
downstairs
and
walked
down
by
himself
but
greatly
to
his
surprise
as
he
crossed
the
landing
the
door
opened
slightly
and
a
hand
was
stretched
out
beckoning
dyson
was
not
the
man
to
hesitate
under
such
circumstances
in
a
moment
he
saw
himself
involved
in
adventure
and
as
he
told
himself
the
dysons
had
never
disobeyed
a
lady
summons
softly
then
with
due
regard
for
the
lady
honor
he
would
have
entered
the
room
when
a
low
but
clear
voice
spoke
to
him
go
downstairs
and
open
the
door
and
shut
it
again
rather
loudly
then
come
up
to
me
and
for
heaven
sake
walk
softly
dyson
obeyed
her
commands
not
without
some
hesitation
for
he
was
afraid
of
meeting
the
landlady
or
the
maid
on
his
return
journey
but
walking
like
a
cat
and
making
each
step
he
trod
on
crack
loudly
he
flattered
himself
that
he
had
escaped
observation
and
as
he
gained
the
top
of
the
stairs
the
door
opened
wide
before
him
and
he
found
himself
in
the
lady
bowing
awkwardly
pray
be
seated
sir
perhaps
this
chair
will
be
the
best
it
was
the
favored
chair
of
my
landlady
deceased
husband
i
would
ask
you
to
smoke
but
the
odor
would
betray
me
i
know
my
proceedings
must
seem
to
you
unconventional
but
i
saw
you
arrive
this
evening
and
i
do
not
think
you
would
refuse
to
help
a
woman
who
is
so
unfortunate
as
i
am
dyson
looked
shyly
at
the
young
lady
before
him
she
was
dressed
in
deep
mourning
but
the
piquant
smiling
face
and
charming
hazel
eyes
ill
accorded
with
the
heavy
garments
and
the
mouldering
surface
of
the
crape
madam
he
said
gallantly
your
instinct
has
served
you
well
we
will
not
trouble
if
you
please
about
the
question
of
social
conventions
the
chivalrous
gentleman
knows
nothing
of
such
matters
i
hope
i
may
be
privileged
to
serve
you
you
are
very
kind
to
me
but
i
knew
it
would
be
so
alas
sir
i
have
had
experience
of
life
and
i
am
rarely
mistaken
yet
man
is
too
often
so
vile
and
so
misjudging
that
i
trembled
even
as
i
resolved
to
take
this
step
which
for
all
i
knew
might
prove
to
be
both
desperate
and
ruinous
with
me
you
have
nothing
to
fear
said
dyson
i
was
nurtured
in
the
faith
of
chivalry
and
i
have
always
endeavored
to
remember
the
proud
traditions
of
my
race
confide
in
me
then
and
count
upon
my
secrecy
and
if
it
prove
possible
you
may
rely
on
my
help
sir
i
will
not
waste
your
time
which
i
am
sure
is
valuable
by
idle
parleyings
learn
then
that
i
am
a
fugitive
and
in
hiding
here
i
place
myself
in
your
power
you
have
but
to
describe
my
features
and
i
fall
into
the
hands
of
my
relentless
enemy
dyson
wondered
for
a
passing
instant
how
this
could
be
but
he
only
renewed
his
promise
of
silence
repeating
that
he
would
be
the
embodied
spirit
of
dark
concealment
good
said
the
lady
the
oriental
fervor
of
your
style
is
delightful
in
the
first
place
i
must
disabuse
your
mind
of
the
conviction
that
i
am
a
widow
these
gloomy
vestments
have
been
forced
on
me
by
strange
circumstance
in
plain
language
i
have
deemed
it
expedient
to
go
disguised
you
have
a
friend
i
think
in
the
house
russell
he
seems
of
a
coy
and
retiring
nature
excuse
me
madam
said
dyson
he
is
not
coy
but
he
is
a
realist
and
perhaps
you
are
aware
that
no
carthusian
monk
can
emulate
the
cloistral
seclusion
in
which
a
realistic
novelist
loves
to
shroud
himself
it
is
his
way
of
observing
human
nature
well
well
said
the
lady
all
this
though
deeply
interesting
is
not
germane
to
our
affair
i
must
tell
you
my
history
with
these
words
the
young
lady
proceeded
to
relate
the
novel
of
the
white
powder
my
name
is
leicester
my
father
major
general
wyn
leicester
a
distinguished
officer
of
artillery
succumbed
five
years
ago
to
a
complicated
liver
complaint
acquired
in
the
deadly
climate
of
india
a
year
later
my
only
brother
francis
came
home
after
an
exceptionally
brilliant
career
at
the
university
and
settled
down
with
the
resolution
of
a
hermit
to
master
what
has
been
well
called
the
great
legend
of
the
law
he
was
a
man
who
seemed
to
live
in
utter
indifference
to
everything
that
is
called
pleasure
and
though
he
was
handsomer
than
most
men
and
could
talk
as
merrily
and
wittily
as
if
he
were
a
mere
vagabond
he
avoided
society
and
shut
himself
up
in
a
large
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
to
make
himself
a
lawyer
ten
hours
a
day
of
hard
reading
was
at
first
his
allotted
portion
from
the
first
light
in
the
east
to
the
late
afternoon
he
remained
shut
up
with
his
books
taking
a
hasty
lunch
with
me
as
if
he
grudged
the
wasting
of
the
moments
and
going
out
for
a
short
walk
when
it
began
to
grow
dusk
i
thought
that
such
relentless
application
must
be
injurious
and
tried
to
cajole
him
from
the
crabbed
but
his
ardor
seemed
to
grow
rather
than
diminish
and
his
daily
tale
of
hours
increased
i
spoke
to
him
seriously
suggesting
some
occasional
relaxation
if
it
were
but
an
idle
afternoon
with
a
harmless
novel
but
he
laughed
and
said
that
he
read
about
feudal
tenures
when
he
felt
in
need
of
amusement
and
scoffed
at
the
notion
of
theatres
or
a
month
fresh
confessed
that
he
looked
well
and
seemed
not
to
suffer
from
his
labors
but
i
knew
that
such
unnatural
toil
would
take
revenge
at
last
and
i
was
not
mistaken
a
look
of
anxiety
began
to
lurk
about
his
eyes
and
he
seemed
languid
and
at
last
he
avowed
that
he
was
no
longer
in
perfect
health
he
was
troubled
he
said
with
a
sensation
of
dizziness
and
awoke
now
and
then
of
nights
from
fearful
dreams
terrified
and
cold
with
icy
sweats
i
am
taking
care
of
myself
he
said
so
you
must
not
trouble
i
passed
the
whole
of
yesterday
afternoon
in
idleness
leaning
back
in
that
comfortable
chair
you
gave
me
and
scribbling
nonsense
on
a
sheet
of
paper
no
no
i
will
not
overdo
my
work
i
shall
be
well
enough
in
a
week
or
two
depend
upon
it
yet
in
spite
of
his
assurances
i
could
see
that
he
grew
no
better
but
rather
worse
he
would
enter
the
with
a
face
all
miserably
wrinkled
and
despondent
and
endeavor
to
look
gayly
when
my
eyes
fell
on
him
and
i
thought
such
symptoms
of
evil
omen
and
was
frightened
sometimes
at
the
nervous
irritation
of
his
movements
and
at
glances
which
i
could
not
decipher
much
against
his
will
i
prevailed
on
him
to
have
medical
advice
and
with
an
ill
grace
he
called
in
our
old
doctor
haberden
cheered
me
after
his
examination
of
his
patient
there
is
nothing
really
much
amiss
he
said
to
me
no
doubt
he
reads
too
hard
and
eats
hastily
and
then
goes
back
again
to
his
books
in
too
great
a
hurry
and
the
natural
consequence
is
some
digestive
trouble
and
a
little
mischief
in
the
nervous
system
but
i
think
i
do
indeed
miss
leicester
that
we
shall
be
able
to
set
this
all
right
i
have
written
him
a
prescription
which
ought
to
do
great
things
so
you
have
no
cause
for
anxiety
my
brother
insisted
on
having
the
prescription
made
up
by
a
chemist
in
the
neighborhood
it
was
an
odd
shop
devoid
of
the
studied
coquetry
and
calculated
glitter
that
make
so
gay
a
show
on
the
counters
and
shelves
of
the
modern
apothecary
but
francis
liked
the
old
chemist
and
believed
in
the
scrupulous
purity
of
his
drugs
the
medicine
was
sent
in
due
course
and
i
saw
that
my
brother
took
it
regularly
after
lunch
and
dinner
it
was
an
white
powder
of
which
a
little
was
dissolved
in
a
glass
of
cold
water
i
stirred
it
in
and
it
seemed
to
disappear
leaving
the
water
clear
and
colorless
at
first
francis
seemed
to
benefit
greatly
the
weariness
vanished
from
his
face
and
he
became
more
cheerful
than
he
had
ever
been
since
the
time
when
he
left
school
he
talked
gayly
of
reforming
himself
and
avowed
to
me
that
he
had
wasted
his
time
i
have
given
too
many
hours
to
law
he
said
laughing
i
think
you
have
saved
me
in
the
nick
of
time
come
i
shall
be
lord
chancellor
yet
but
i
must
not
forget
life
you
and
i
will
have
a
holiday
together
before
long
we
will
go
to
paris
and
enjoy
ourselves
and
keep
away
from
the
bibliothèque
nationale
i
confessed
myself
delighted
with
the
prospect
when
shall
we
go
i
said
i
can
start
the
day
after
if
you
like
ah
that
is
perhaps
a
little
too
soon
after
all
i
do
not
know
london
yet
and
i
suppose
a
man
ought
to
give
the
pleasures
of
his
own
country
the
first
choice
but
we
will
go
off
together
in
a
week
or
two
so
try
and
furbish
up
your
french
i
only
know
law
french
myself
and
i
am
afraid
that
would
do
we
were
just
finishing
dinner
and
he
quaffed
off
his
medicine
with
a
parade
of
carousal
as
if
it
had
been
wine
from
some
choicest
bin
has
it
any
particular
taste
i
said
no
i
should
not
know
i
was
not
drinking
water
and
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
as
if
he
were
undecided
as
to
what
he
should
do
next
shall
we
have
coffee
in
the
i
said
or
would
you
like
to
smoke
no
i
think
i
will
take
a
turn
it
seems
a
pleasant
evening
look
at
the
afterglow
why
it
is
as
if
a
great
city
were
burning
in
flames
and
down
there
between
the
dark
houses
it
is
raining
blood
fast
fast
yes
i
will
go
out
i
may
be
in
soon
but
i
shall
take
my
key
so
dear
if
i
do
see
you
again
the
door
slammed
behind
him
and
i
saw
him
walk
lightly
down
the
street
swinging
his
malacca
cane
and
i
felt
grateful
to
haberden
for
such
an
improvement
i
believe
my
brother
came
home
very
late
that
night
but
he
was
in
a
merry
mood
the
next
morning
i
walked
on
without
thinking
where
i
was
going
he
said
enjoying
the
freshness
of
the
air
and
livened
by
the
crowds
as
i
reached
more
frequented
quarters
and
then
i
met
an
old
college
friend
orford
in
the
press
of
the
pavement
and
then
well
we
enjoyed
ourselves
i
have
felt
what
it
is
to
be
young
and
a
man
i
find
i
have
blood
in
my
veins
as
other
men
have
i
made
an
appointment
with
orford
for
there
will
be
a
little
party
of
us
at
the
restaurant
yes
i
shall
enjoy
myself
for
a
week
or
two
and
hear
the
chimes
at
midnight
and
then
we
will
go
for
our
little
trip
together
such
was
the
transmutation
of
my
brother
character
that
in
a
few
days
he
became
a
lover
of
pleasure
a
careless
and
merry
idler
of
western
pavements
a
hunter
out
of
snug
restaurants
and
a
fine
critic
of
fantastic
dancing
he
grew
fat
before
my
eyes
and
said
no
more
of
paris
for
he
had
clearly
found
his
paradise
in
london
i
rejoiced
and
yet
wondered
a
little
for
there
was
i
thought
something
in
his
gayety
that
indefinitely
displeased
me
though
i
could
not
have
defined
my
feeling
but
by
degrees
there
came
a
change
he
returned
still
in
the
cold
hours
of
the
morning
but
i
heard
no
more
about
his
pleasures
and
one
morning
as
we
sat
at
breakfast
together
i
looked
suddenly
into
his
eyes
and
saw
a
stranger
before
me
oh
francis
i
cried
oh
francis
francis
what
have
you
done
and
rending
sobs
cut
the
words
short
and
i
went
weeping
out
of
the
room
for
though
i
knew
nothing
yet
i
knew
all
and
by
some
odd
play
of
thought
i
remembered
the
evening
when
he
first
went
abroad
to
prove
his
manhood
and
the
picture
of
the
sunset
sky
glowed
before
me
the
clouds
like
a
city
in
burning
flames
and
the
rain
of
blood
yet
i
did
battle
with
such
thoughts
resolving
that
perhaps
after
all
no
great
harm
had
been
done
and
in
the
evening
at
dinner
i
resolved
to
press
him
to
fix
a
day
for
our
holiday
in
paris
we
had
talked
easily
enough
and
my
brother
had
just
taken
his
medicine
which
he
had
continued
all
the
while
i
was
about
to
begin
my
topic
when
the
words
forming
in
my
mind
vanished
and
i
wondered
for
a
second
what
icy
and
intolerable
weight
oppressed
my
heart
and
suffocated
me
as
with
the
unutterable
horror
of
the
nailed
down
on
the
living
we
had
dined
without
candles
and
the
room
had
slowly
grown
from
twilight
to
gloom
and
the
walls
and
corners
were
indistinct
in
the
shadow
but
from
where
i
sat
i
looked
out
into
the
street
and
as
i
thought
of
what
i
would
say
to
francis
the
sky
began
to
flush
and
shine
as
it
had
done
on
a
evening
and
in
the
gap
between
two
dark
masses
that
were
houses
an
awful
pageantry
of
flame
appeared
lurid
whorls
of
writhed
cloud
and
utter
depths
burning
and
gray
masses
like
the
fume
blown
from
a
smoking
city
and
an
evil
glory
blazing
far
above
shot
with
tongues
of
more
ardent
fire
and
below
as
if
there
were
a
deep
pool
of
blood
i
looked
down
to
where
my
brother
sat
facing
me
and
the
words
were
shaped
on
my
lips
when
i
saw
his
hand
resting
on
the
table
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
the
closed
hand
there
was
a
mark
a
small
patch
about
the
size
of
a
sixpence
and
somewhat
of
the
color
of
a
bad
bruise
yet
by
some
sense
i
can
not
define
i
knew
that
what
i
saw
was
no
bruise
at
all
oh
if
human
flesh
could
burn
with
flame
and
if
flame
could
be
black
as
pitch
such
was
that
before
me
without
thought
or
fashioning
of
words
gray
horror
shaped
within
me
at
the
sight
and
in
an
inner
cell
it
was
known
to
be
a
brand
for
a
moment
the
stained
sky
became
dark
as
midnight
and
when
the
light
returned
to
me
i
was
alone
in
the
silent
room
and
soon
after
i
heard
my
brother
go
out
late
as
it
was
i
put
on
my
bonnet
and
went
to
haberden
and
in
his
great
by
a
candle
which
the
doctor
brought
in
with
him
with
stammering
lips
and
a
voice
that
would
break
in
spite
of
my
resolve
i
told
him
all
from
the
day
on
which
my
brother
began
to
take
the
medicine
down
to
the
dreadful
thing
i
had
seen
scarcely
half
an
hour
before
when
i
had
done
the
doctor
looked
at
me
for
a
minute
with
an
expression
of
great
pity
on
his
face
my
dear
miss
leicester
he
said
you
have
evidently
been
anxious
about
your
brother
you
have
been
worrying
over
him
i
am
sure
come
now
is
it
not
so
i
have
certainly
been
anxious
i
said
for
the
last
week
or
two
i
have
not
felt
at
ease
quite
so
you
know
of
course
what
a
queer
thing
the
brain
is
i
understand
what
you
mean
but
i
was
not
deceived
i
saw
what
i
have
told
you
with
my
own
eyes
yes
yes
of
course
but
your
eyes
had
been
staring
at
that
very
curious
sunset
we
had
that
is
the
only
explanation
you
will
see
it
in
the
proper
light
i
am
sure
but
remember
i
am
always
ready
to
give
any
help
that
is
in
my
power
do
not
scruple
to
come
to
me
or
to
send
for
me
if
you
are
in
any
distress
i
went
away
but
little
comforted
all
confusion
and
terror
and
sorrow
not
knowing
where
to
turn
when
my
brother
and
i
met
the
next
day
i
looked
quickly
at
him
and
noticed
with
a
sickening
at
heart
that
the
right
hand
the
hand
on
which
i
had
clearly
seen
the
patch
as
of
a
black
fire
was
wrapped
up
with
a
handkerchief
what
is
the
matter
with
your
hand
francis
i
said
in
a
steady
voice
nothing
of
consequence
i
cut
a
finger
last
night
and
it
bled
rather
awkwardly
so
i
did
it
up
roughly
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
will
do
it
neatly
for
you
if
you
like
no
thank
you
dear
this
will
answer
very
well
suppose
we
have
breakfast
i
am
quite
hungry
we
sat
down
and
i
watched
him
he
scarcely
ate
or
drank
at
all
but
tossed
his
meat
to
the
dog
when
he
thought
my
eyes
were
turned
away
and
there
was
a
look
in
his
eyes
that
i
had
never
yet
seen
and
the
thought
fled
across
my
mind
that
it
was
a
look
that
was
scarcely
human
i
was
firmly
convinced
that
awful
and
incredible
as
was
the
thing
i
had
seen
the
night
before
yet
it
was
no
illusion
no
glamour
of
bewildered
sense
and
in
the
course
of
the
morning
i
went
again
to
the
house
he
shook
his
head
with
an
air
puzzled
and
incredulous
and
seemed
to
reflect
for
a
few
minutes
and
you
say
he
still
keeps
up
the
medicine
but
why
as
i
understand
all
the
symptoms
he
complained
of
have
disappeared
long
ago
why
should
he
go
on
taking
the
stuff
when
he
is
quite
well
and
by
the
bye
where
did
he
get
it
made
up
at
sayce
i
never
send
any
one
there
the
old
man
is
getting
careless
suppose
you
come
with
me
to
the
chemist
i
should
like
to
have
some
talk
with
him
we
walked
together
to
the
shop
old
sayce
knew
haberden
and
was
quite
ready
to
give
any
information
you
have
been
sending
that
in
to
leicester
for
some
weeks
i
think
on
my
prescription
said
the
doctor
giving
the
old
man
a
pencilled
scrap
of
paper
the
chemist
put
on
his
great
spectacles
with
trembling
uncertainty
and
held
up
the
paper
with
a
shaking
hand
oh
yes
he
said
i
have
very
little
of
it
left
it
is
rather
an
uncommon
drug
and
i
have
had
it
in
stock
some
time
i
must
get
in
some
more
if
leicester
goes
on
with
it
kindly
let
me
have
a
look
at
the
stuff
said
haberden
and
the
chemist
gave
him
a
glass
bottle
he
took
out
the
stopper
and
smelt
the
contents
and
looked
strangely
at
the
old
man
where
did
you
get
this
he
said
and
what
is
it
for
one
thing
sayce
it
is
not
what
i
prescribed
yes
yes
i
see
the
label
is
right
enough
but
i
tell
you
this
is
not
the
drug
i
have
had
it
a
long
time
said
the
old
man
in
feeble
terror
i
got
it
from
burbage
in
the
usual
way
it
is
not
prescribed
often
and
i
have
had
it
on
the
shelf
for
some
years
you
see
there
is
very
little
left
you
had
better
give
it
to
me
said
haberden
i
am
afraid
something
wrong
has
happened
we
went
out
of
the
shop
in
silence
the
doctor
carrying
the
bottle
neatly
wrapped
in
paper
under
his
arm
haberden
i
said
when
we
had
walked
a
little
way
dr
haberden
yes
he
said
looking
at
me
gloomily
enough
i
should
like
you
to
tell
me
what
my
brother
has
been
taking
twice
a
day
for
the
last
month
or
so
frankly
miss
leicester
i
do
know
we
will
speak
of
this
when
we
get
to
my
house
we
walked
on
quickly
without
another
word
till
we
reached
haberden
he
asked
me
to
sit
down
and
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
his
face
clouded
over
as
i
could
see
with
no
common
fears
well
he
said
at
length
this
is
all
very
strange
it
is
only
natural
that
you
should
feel
alarmed
and
i
must
confess
that
my
mind
is
far
from
easy
we
will
put
aside
if
you
please
what
you
told
me
last
night
and
this
morning
but
the
fact
remains
that
for
the
last
few
weeks
leicester
has
been
impregnating
his
system
with
a
drug
which
is
completely
unknown
to
me
i
tell
you
it
is
not
what
i
ordered
and
what
that
stuff
in
the
bottle
really
is
remains
to
be
seen
he
undid
the
wrapper
and
cautiously
tilted
a
few
grains
of
the
white
powder
on
to
a
piece
of
paper
and
peered
curiously
at
it
yes
he
said
it
is
like
the
sulphate
of
quinine
as
you
say
it
is
flaky
but
smell
it
he
held
the
bottle
to
me
and
i
bent
over
it
it
was
a
strange
sickly
smell
vaporous
and
overpowering
like
some
strong
anæsthetic
i
shall
have
it
analyzed
said
haberden
i
have
a
friend
who
has
devoted
his
whole
life
to
chemistry
as
a
science
then
we
shall
have
something
to
go
upon
no
no
say
no
more
about
that
other
matter
i
can
not
listen
to
that
and
take
my
advice
and
think
no
more
about
it
yourself
that
evening
my
brother
did
not
go
out
as
usual
after
dinner
i
have
had
my
fling
he
said
with
a
queer
laugh
and
i
must
go
back
to
my
old
ways
a
little
law
will
be
quite
a
relaxation
after
so
sharp
a
dose
of
pleasure
and
he
grinned
to
himself
and
soon
after
went
up
to
his
room
his
hand
was
still
all
bandaged
haberden
called
a
few
days
later
i
have
no
special
news
to
give
you
he
said
chambers
is
out
of
town
so
i
know
no
more
about
that
stuff
than
you
do
but
i
should
like
to
see
leicester
if
he
is
in
he
is
in
his
room
i
said
i
will
tell
him
you
are
here
no
no
i
will
go
up
to
him
we
will
have
a
little
quiet
talk
together
i
dare
say
that
we
have
made
a
good
deal
of
fuss
about
very
little
for
after
all
whatever
the
white
powder
may
be
it
seems
to
have
done
him
good
the
doctor
went
upstairs
and
standing
in
the
hall
i
heard
his
knock
and
the
opening
and
shutting
of
the
door
and
then
i
waited
in
the
silent
house
for
an
hour
and
the
stillness
grew
more
and
more
intense
as
the
hands
of
the
clock
crept
round
then
there
sounded
from
above
the
noise
of
a
door
shut
sharply
and
the
doctor
was
coming
down
the
stairs
his
footsteps
crossed
the
hall
and
there
was
a
pause
at
the
door
i
drew
a
long
sick
breath
with
difficulty
and
saw
my
face
white
in
a
little
mirror
and
he
came
in
and
stood
at
the
door
there
was
an
unutterable
horror
shining
in
his
eyes
he
steadied
himself
by
holding
the
back
of
a
chair
with
one
hand
and
his
lower
lip
trembled
like
a
horse
and
he
gulped
and
stammered
unintelligible
sounds
before
he
spoke
i
have
seen
that
man
he
began
in
a
dry
whisper
i
have
been
sitting
in
his
presence
for
the
last
hour
my
god
and
i
am
alive
and
in
my
senses
i
who
have
dealt
with
death
all
my
life
and
have
dabbled
with
the
melting
ruins
of
the
earthly
tabernacle
but
not
this
oh
not
this
and
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
as
if
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
something
before
him
do
not
send
for
me
again
miss
leicester
he
said
with
more
composure
i
can
do
nothing
in
this
house
as
i
watched
him
totter
down
the
steps
and
along
the
pavement
towards
his
house
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
had
aged
by
ten
years
since
the
morning
my
brother
remained
in
his
room
he
called
out
to
me
in
a
voice
i
hardly
recognized
that
he
was
very
busy
and
would
like
his
meals
brought
to
his
door
and
left
there
and
i
gave
the
order
to
the
servants
from
that
day
it
seemed
as
if
the
arbitrary
conception
we
call
time
had
been
annihilated
for
me
i
lived
in
an
ever
present
sense
of
horror
going
through
the
routine
of
the
house
mechanically
and
only
speaking
a
few
necessary
words
to
the
servants
now
and
then
i
went
out
and
paced
the
streets
for
an
hour
or
two
and
came
home
again
but
whether
i
were
without
or
within
my
spirit
delayed
before
the
closed
door
of
the
upper
room
and
shuddering
waited
for
it
to
open
i
have
said
that
i
scarcely
reckoned
time
but
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
a
fortnight
after
haberden
visit
that
i
came
home
from
my
stroll
a
little
refreshed
and
lightened
the
air
was
sweet
and
pleasant
and
the
hazy
form
of
green
leaves
floating
in
the
square
and
the
smell
of
blossoms
had
charmed
my
senses
and
i
felt
happier
and
walked
more
briskly
as
i
delayed
a
moment
at
the
verge
of
the
pavement
waiting
for
a
van
to
pass
by
before
crossing
over
to
the
house
i
happened
to
look
up
at
the
windows
and
instantly
there
was
the
rush
and
swirl
of
deep
cold
waters
in
my
ears
and
my
heart
leapt
up
and
fell
down
down
as
into
a
deep
hollow
and
i
was
amazed
with
a
dread
and
terror
without
form
or
shape
i
stretched
out
a
hand
blindly
through
folds
of
thick
darkness
from
the
black
and
shadowy
valley
and
held
myself
from
falling
while
the
stones
beneath
my
feet
rocked
and
swayed
and
tilted
and
the
sense
of
solid
things
seemed
to
sink
away
from
under
me
i
had
glanced
up
at
the
window
of
my
brother
study
and
at
that
moment
the
blind
was
drawn
aside
and
something
that
had
life
stared
out
into
the
world
nay
i
can
not
say
i
saw
a
face
or
any
human
likeness
a
living
thing
two
eyes
of
burning
flame
glared
at
me
and
they
were
in
the
midst
of
something
as
formless
as
my
fear
the
symbol
and
presence
of
all
evil
and
all
hideous
corruption
i
stood
shuddering
and
quaking
as
with
the
grip
of
ague
sick
with
unspeakable
agonies
of
fear
and
loathing
and
for
five
minutes
i
could
not
summon
force
or
motion
to
my
limbs
when
i
was
within
the
door
i
ran
up
the
stairs
to
my
room
and
knocked
francis
francis
i
cried
for
heaven
sake
answer
me
what
is
the
horrible
thing
in
your
room
cast
it
out
francis
cast
it
from
you
i
heard
a
noise
as
of
feet
shuffling
slowly
and
awkwardly
and
a
choking
gurgling
sound
as
if
some
one
was
struggling
to
find
utterance
and
then
the
noise
of
a
voice
broken
and
stifled
and
words
that
i
could
scarcely
understand
there
is
nothing
here
the
voice
said
pray
do
not
disturb
me
i
am
not
very
well
i
turned
away
horrified
and
yet
helpless
i
could
do
nothing
and
i
wondered
why
francis
had
lied
to
me
for
i
had
seen
the
appearance
beyond
the
glass
too
plainly
to
be
deceived
though
it
was
but
the
sight
of
a
moment
and
i
sat
still
conscious
that
there
had
been
something
else
something
i
had
seen
in
the
first
flash
of
terror
before
those
burning
eyes
had
looked
at
me
suddenly
i
remembered
as
i
lifted
my
face
the
blind
was
being
drawn
back
and
i
had
had
an
instant
glance
of
the
thing
that
was
moving
it
and
in
my
recollection
i
knew
that
a
hideous
image
was
engraved
forever
on
my
brain
it
was
not
a
hand
there
were
no
fingers
that
held
the
blind
but
a
black
stump
pushed
it
aside
the
mouldering
outline
and
the
clumsy
movement
as
of
a
beast
paw
had
glowed
into
my
senses
before
the
darkling
waves
of
terror
had
overwhelmed
me
as
i
went
down
quick
into
the
pit
my
mind
was
aghast
at
the
thought
of
this
and
of
the
awful
presence
that
dwelt
with
my
brother
in
his
room
i
went
to
his
door
and
cried
to
him
again
but
no
answer
came
that
night
one
of
the
servants
came
up
to
me
and
told
me
in
a
whisper
that
for
three
days
food
had
been
regularly
placed
at
the
door
and
left
untouched
the
maid
had
knocked
but
had
received
no
answer
she
had
heard
the
noise
of
shuffling
feet
that
i
had
noticed
day
after
day
went
by
and
still
my
brother
meals
were
brought
to
his
door
and
left
untouched
and
though
i
knocked
and
called
again
and
again
i
could
get
no
answer
the
servants
began
to
talk
to
me
it
appeared
they
were
as
alarmed
as
i
the
cook
said
that
when
my
brother
first
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
she
used
to
hear
him
come
out
at
night
and
go
about
the
house
and
once
she
said
the
hall
door
had
opened
and
closed
again
but
for
several
nights
she
had
heard
no
sound
the
climax
came
at
last
it
was
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
and
i
was
sitting
in
the
darkening
dreary
room
when
a
terrible
shriek
jarred
and
rang
harshly
out
of
the
silence
and
i
heard
a
frightened
scurry
of
feet
dashing
down
the
stairs
i
waited
and
the
servant
maid
staggered
into
the
room
and
faced
me
white
and
trembling
o
miss
helen
she
whispered
oh
for
the
lord
sake
miss
helen
what
has
happened
look
at
my
hand
miss
look
at
that
hand
i
drew
her
to
the
window
and
saw
there
was
a
black
wet
stain
upon
her
hand
i
do
not
understand
you
i
said
will
you
explain
to
me
i
was
doing
your
room
just
now
she
began
i
was
turning
down
the
bedclothes
and
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
something
fell
upon
my
hand
wet
and
i
looked
up
and
the
ceiling
was
black
and
dripping
on
me
i
looked
bard
at
her
and
bit
my
lip
come
with
me
i
said
bring
your
candle
with
you
the
room
i
slept
in
was
beneath
my
brother
and
as
i
went
in
i
felt
i
was
trembling
i
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
and
saw
a
patch
all
black
and
wet
and
a
dew
of
black
drops
upon
it
and
a
pool
of
horrible
liquor
soaking
into
the
white
bedclothes
i
ran
upstairs
and
knocked
loudly
o
francis
francis
my
dear
brother
i
cried
what
has
happened
to
you
and
i
listened
there
was
a
sound
of
choking
and
a
noise
like
water
bubbling
and
regurgitating
but
nothing
else
and
i
called
louder
but
no
answer
came
in
spite
of
what
haberden
had
said
i
went
to
him
and
with
tears
streaming
down
my
cheeks
i
told
him
of
all
that
had
happened
and
he
listened
to
me
with
a
face
set
hard
and
grim
for
your
father
sake
he
said
at
last
i
will
go
with
you
though
i
can
do
nothing
we
went
out
together
the
streets
were
dark
and
silent
and
heavy
with
heat
and
a
drought
of
many
weeks
i
saw
the
doctor
face
white
under
the
and
when
we
reached
the
house
his
hand
was
shaking
we
did
not
hesitate
but
went
upstairs
directly
i
held
the
lamp
and
he
called
out
in
a
loud
determined
voice
leicester
do
you
hear
me
i
insist
on
seeing
you
answer
me
at
once
there
was
no
answer
but
we
both
heard
that
choking
noise
i
have
mentioned
leicester
i
am
waiting
for
you
open
the
door
this
instant
or
i
shall
break
it
down
and
he
called
a
third
time
in
a
voice
that
rang
and
echoed
from
the
walls
leicester
for
the
last
time
i
order
you
to
open
the
door
ah
he
said
after
a
pause
of
heavy
silence
we
are
wasting
time
here
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
get
me
a
poker
or
something
of
the
kind
i
ran
into
a
little
room
at
the
back
where
odd
articles
were
kept
and
found
a
heavy
tool
that
i
thought
might
serve
the
purpose
very
good
he
said
that
will
do
i
dare
say
i
give
you
notice
leicester
he
cried
loudly
at
the
keyhole
that
i
am
now
about
to
break
into
your
room
then
i
heard
the
wrench
of
the
adze
and
the
woodwork
split
and
cracked
under
it
and
with
a
loud
crash
the
door
suddenly
burst
open
and
for
a
moment
we
started
back
aghast
at
a
fearful
screaming
cry
no
human
voice
but
as
the
roar
of
a
monster
that
burst
forth
inarticulate
and
struck
at
us
out
of
the
darkness
hold
the
lamp
said
the
doctor
and
we
went
in
and
glanced
quickly
round
the
room
there
it
is
said
haberden
drawing
a
quick
breath
look
in
that
corner
i
looked
and
a
pang
of
horror
seized
my
heart
as
with
a
iron
there
upon
the
floor
was
a
dark
and
putrid
mass
seething
with
corruption
and
hideous
rottenness
neither
liquid
nor
solid
but
melting
and
changing
before
our
eyes
and
bubbling
with
unctuous
oily
bubbles
like
boiling
pitch
and
out
of
the
midst
of
it
shone
two
burning
points
like
eyes
and
i
saw
a
writhing
and
stirring
as
of
limbs
and
something
moved
and
lifted
up
that
might
have
been
an
arm
the
doctor
took
a
step
forward
and
raised
the
iron
bar
and
struck
at
the
burning
points
and
drove
in
the
weapon
and
struck
again
and
again
in
a
fury
of
loathing
at
last
the
thing
was
quiet
a
week
or
two
later
when
i
had
to
some
extent
recovered
from
the
terrible
shock
haberden
came
to
see
me
i
have
sold
my
practice
he
began
and
i
am
sailing
on
a
long
voyage
i
do
not
know
whether
i
shall
ever
return
to
england
in
all
probability
i
shall
buy
a
little
land
in
california
and
settle
there
for
the
remainder
of
my
life
i
have
brought
you
this
packet
which
you
may
open
and
read
when
you
feel
able
to
do
so
it
contains
the
report
of
dr
chambers
on
what
i
submitted
to
him
miss
leicester
when
he
was
gone
i
opened
the
envelope
i
could
not
wait
and
proceeded
to
read
the
papers
within
here
is
the
manuscript
and
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
read
you
the
astounding
story
it
contains
my
dear
haberden
the
letter
began
i
have
delayed
inexcusably
in
answering
your
questions
as
to
the
white
substance
you
sent
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
hesitated
for
some
time
as
to
what
course
i
should
adopt
for
there
is
a
bigotry
and
an
orthodox
standard
in
physical
science
as
in
theology
and
i
knew
that
if
i
told
you
the
truth
i
should
offend
rooted
prejudices
which
i
once
held
dear
myself
however
i
have
determined
to
be
plain
with
you
and
first
i
must
enter
into
a
short
personal
explanation
you
have
known
me
haberden
for
many
years
as
a
scientific
man
you
and
i
have
often
talked
of
our
profession
together
and
discussed
the
hopeless
gulf
that
opens
before
the
feet
of
those
who
think
to
attain
to
truth
by
any
means
whatsoever
except
the
beaten
way
of
experiment
and
observation
in
the
sphere
of
material
things
i
remember
the
scorn
with
which
you
have
spoken
to
me
of
men
of
science
who
have
dabbled
a
little
in
the
unseen
and
have
timidly
hinted
that
perhaps
the
senses
are
not
after
all
the
eternal
impenetrable
bounds
of
all
knowledge
the
everlasting
walls
beyond
which
no
human
being
has
ever
passed
we
have
laughed
together
heartily
and
i
think
justly
at
the
occult
follies
of
the
day
disguised
under
various
names
the
mesmerisms
spiritualisms
materializations
theosophies
all
the
rabble
rant
of
imposture
with
their
machinery
of
poor
tricks
and
feeble
conjuring
the
true
magic
of
shabby
london
streets
yet
in
spite
of
what
i
have
said
i
must
confess
to
you
that
i
am
no
materialist
taking
the
word
of
course
in
its
usual
signification
it
is
now
many
years
since
i
have
convinced
myself
convinced
myself
a
sceptic
remember
that
the
old
theory
is
utterly
and
entirely
false
perhaps
this
confession
will
not
wound
you
so
sharply
as
it
would
have
done
twenty
years
ago
for
i
think
you
can
not
have
failed
to
notice
that
for
some
time
hypotheses
have
been
advanced
by
men
of
pure
science
which
are
nothing
less
than
transcendental
and
i
suspect
that
most
modern
chemists
and
biologists
of
repute
would
not
hesitate
to
subscribe
the
of
the
old
schoolman
exeunt
in
which
means
i
take
it
that
every
branch
of
human
knowledge
if
traced
up
to
its
source
and
final
principles
vanishes
into
mystery
i
need
not
trouble
you
now
with
a
detailed
account
of
the
painful
steps
which
led
me
to
my
conclusions
a
few
simple
experiments
suggested
a
doubt
as
to
my
then
standpoint
and
a
train
of
thought
that
rose
from
circumstances
comparatively
trifling
brought
me
far
my
old
conception
of
the
universe
has
been
swept
away
and
i
stand
in
a
world
that
seems
as
strange
and
awful
to
me
as
the
endless
waves
of
the
ocean
seen
for
the
first
time
shining
from
a
peak
in
darien
now
i
know
that
the
walls
of
sense
that
seemed
so
impenetrable
that
seemed
to
loom
up
above
the
heavens
and
to
be
founded
below
the
depths
and
to
shut
us
in
forevermore
are
no
such
everlasting
impassable
barriers
as
we
fancied
but
thinnest
and
most
airy
veils
that
melt
away
before
the
seeker
and
dissolve
as
the
early
mist
of
the
morning
about
the
brooks
i
know
that
you
never
adopted
the
extreme
materialistic
position
you
did
not
go
about
trying
to
prove
a
universal
negative
for
your
logical
sense
withheld
you
from
that
crowning
absurdity
yet
i
am
sure
that
you
will
find
all
that
i
am
saying
strange
and
repellent
to
your
habits
of
thought
yet
haberden
what
i
tell
you
is
the
truth
nay
to
adopt
our
common
language
the
sole
and
scientific
truth
verified
by
experience
and
the
universe
is
verily
more
splendid
and
more
awful
than
we
used
to
dream
the
whole
universe
my
friend
is
a
tremendous
sacrament
a
mystic
ineffable
force
and
energy
veiled
by
an
outward
form
of
matter
and
man
and
the
sun
and
the
other
stars
and
the
flower
of
the
grass
and
the
crystal
in
the
are
each
and
every
one
as
spiritual
as
material
and
subject
to
an
inner
working
you
will
perhaps
wonder
haberden
whence
all
this
tends
but
i
think
a
little
thought
will
make
it
clear
you
will
understand
that
from
such
a
standpoint
the
whole
view
of
things
is
changed
and
what
we
thought
incredible
and
absurd
may
be
possible
enough
in
short
we
must
look
at
legend
and
belief
with
other
eyes
and
be
prepared
to
accept
tales
that
had
become
mere
fables
indeed
this
is
no
such
great
demand
after
all
modern
science
will
concede
as
much
in
a
hypocritical
manner
you
must
not
it
is
true
believe
in
witchcraft
but
you
may
credit
hypnotism
ghosts
are
out
of
date
but
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
the
theory
of
telepathy
give
a
superstition
a
greek
name
and
believe
in
it
should
almost
be
a
proverb
so
much
for
my
personal
explanation
you
sent
me
haberden
a
phial
stoppered
and
sealed
containing
a
small
quantity
of
a
flaky
white
powder
obtained
from
a
chemist
who
has
been
dispensing
it
to
one
of
your
patients
i
am
not
surprised
to
hear
that
this
powder
refused
to
yield
any
results
to
your
analysis
it
is
a
substance
which
was
known
to
a
few
many
hundred
years
ago
but
which
i
never
expected
to
have
submitted
to
me
from
the
shop
of
a
modern
apothecary
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
the
truth
of
the
man
tale
he
no
doubt
got
as
he
says
the
rather
uncommon
salt
you
prescribed
from
the
wholesale
chemist
and
it
has
probably
remained
on
his
shelf
for
twenty
years
or
perhaps
longer
here
what
we
call
chance
and
coincidence
begins
to
work
during
all
these
years
the
salt
in
the
bottle
was
exposed
to
certain
recurring
variations
of
temperature
variations
probably
ranging
from
to
and
as
it
happens
such
changes
recurring
year
after
year
at
irregular
intervals
and
with
varying
degrees
of
intensity
and
duration
have
constituted
a
process
and
a
process
so
complicated
and
so
delicate
that
i
question
whether
modern
scientific
apparatus
directed
with
the
utmost
precision
could
produce
the
same
result
the
white
powder
you
sent
me
is
something
very
different
from
the
drug
you
prescribed
it
is
the
powder
from
which
the
wine
of
the
sabbath
the
was
prepared
no
doubt
you
have
read
of
the
sabbath
and
have
laughed
at
the
tales
which
terrified
our
ancestors
the
black
cats
and
the
broomsticks
and
dooms
pronounced
against
some
old
woman
cow
since
i
have
known
the
truth
i
have
often
reflected
that
it
is
on
the
whole
a
happy
thing
that
such
burlesque
as
this
is
believed
for
it
serves
to
conceal
much
that
it
is
better
should
not
be
known
generally
however
if
you
care
to
read
the
appendix
to
payne
knight
monograph
you
will
find
that
the
true
sabbath
was
something
very
different
though
the
writer
has
very
nicely
refrained
from
printing
all
he
knew
the
secrets
of
the
true
sabbath
were
the
secrets
of
remote
times
surviving
into
the
middle
ages
secrets
of
an
evil
science
which
existed
long
before
aryan
man
entered
europe
men
and
women
seduced
from
their
homes
on
specious
pretences
were
met
by
beings
well
qualified
to
assume
as
they
did
assume
the
part
of
devils
and
taken
by
their
guides
to
some
desolate
and
lonely
place
known
to
the
initiate
by
long
tradition
and
unknown
to
all
else
perhaps
it
was
a
cave
in
some
bare
and
hill
perhaps
some
inmost
recess
of
a
great
forest
and
there
the
sabbath
was
held
there
in
the
blackest
hour
of
night
the
was
prepared
and
this
evil
graal
was
poured
forth
and
offered
to
the
neophytes
and
they
partook
of
an
infernal
sacrament
calicem
principis
inferorum
as
an
old
author
well
expresses
it
and
suddenly
each
one
that
had
drunk
found
himself
attended
by
a
companion
a
shape
of
glamour
and
unearthly
allurement
beckoning
him
apart
to
share
in
joys
more
exquisite
more
piercing
than
the
thrill
of
any
dream
to
the
consummation
of
the
marriage
of
the
sabbath
it
is
hard
to
write
of
such
things
as
these
and
chiefly
because
that
shape
that
allured
with
loveliness
was
no
hallucination
but
awful
as
it
is
to
express
the
man
himself
by
the
power
of
that
sabbath
wine
a
few
grains
of
white
powder
thrown
into
a
glass
of
water
the
house
of
life
was
riven
asunder
and
the
human
trinity
dissolved
and
the
worm
which
never
dies
that
which
lies
sleeping
within
us
all
was
made
tangible
and
an
external
thing
and
clothed
with
a
garment
of
flesh
and
then
in
the
hour
of
midnight
the
primal
fall
was
repeated
and
represented
and
the
awful
thing
veiled
in
the
mythos
of
the
tree
in
the
garden
was
done
anew
such
was
the
i
prefer
to
say
no
more
you
haberden
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
the
most
trivial
laws
of
life
are
not
to
be
broken
with
impunity
and
for
so
terrible
an
act
as
this
in
which
the
very
inmost
place
of
the
temple
was
broken
open
and
defiled
a
terrible
vengeance
followed
what
began
with
corruption
ended
also
with
corruption
underneath
is
the
following
in
haberden
writing
the
whole
of
the
above
is
unfortunately
strictly
and
entirely
true
your
brother
confessed
all
to
me
on
that
morning
when
i
saw
him
in
his
room
my
attention
was
first
attracted
to
the
bandaged
hand
and
i
forced
him
to
show
it
me
what
i
saw
made
me
a
medical
man
of
many
years
standing
grow
sick
with
loathing
and
the
story
i
was
forced
to
listen
to
was
infinitely
more
frightful
than
i
could
have
believed
possible
it
has
tempted
me
to
doubt
the
eternal
goodness
which
can
permit
nature
to
offer
such
hideous
possibilities
and
if
you
had
not
with
your
own
eyes
seen
the
end
i
should
have
said
to
you
disbelieve
it
all
i
have
not
i
think
many
more
weeks
to
live
but
you
are
young
and
may
forget
all
this
joseph
haberden
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
months
i
heard
that
haberden
had
died
at
sea
shortly
after
the
ship
left
england
miss
leicester
ceased
speaking
and
looked
pathetically
at
dyson
who
could
not
refrain
from
exhibiting
some
symptoms
of
uneasiness
he
stuttered
out
some
broken
phrases
expressive
of
his
deep
interest
in
her
extraordinary
history
and
then
said
with
a
better
grace
but
pardon
me
miss
leicester
i
understood
you
were
in
some
difficulty
you
were
kind
enough
to
ask
me
to
assist
you
in
some
way
ah
she
said
i
had
forgotten
that
my
own
present
trouble
seems
of
such
little
consequence
in
comparison
with
what
i
have
told
you
but
as
you
are
so
good
to
me
i
will
go
on
you
will
scarcely
believe
it
but
i
found
that
certain
persons
suspected
or
rather
pretended
to
suspect
that
i
had
murdered
my
brother
these
persons
were
relatives
of
mine
and
their
motives
were
extremely
sordid
ones
but
i
actually
found
myself
subject
to
the
shameful
indignity
of
being
watched
yes
sir
my
steps
were
dogged
when
i
went
abroad
and
at
home
i
found
myself
exposed
to
constant
if
artful
observation
with
my
high
spirit
this
was
more
than
i
could
brook
and
i
resolved
to
set
my
wits
to
work
and
elude
the
persons
who
were
shadowing
me
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
succeed
i
assumed
this
disguise
and
for
some
time
have
lain
snug
and
unsuspected
but
of
late
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
pursuer
is
on
my
track
unless
i
am
greatly
deceived
i
saw
yesterday
the
detective
who
is
charged
with
the
odious
duty
of
observing
my
movements
you
sir
are
watchful
and
tell
me
did
you
see
any
one
lurking
about
this
evening
i
hardly
think
so
said
dyson
but
perhaps
you
would
give
me
some
description
of
the
detective
in
question
certainly
he
is
a
youngish
man
dark
with
dark
whiskers
he
has
adopted
spectacles
of
large
size
in
the
hope
of
disguising
himself
effectually
but
he
can
not
disguise
his
uneasy
manner
and
the
quick
nervous
glances
he
casts
to
right
and
left
this
piece
of
description
was
the
last
straw
for
the
unhappy
dyson
who
was
foaming
with
impatience
to
get
out
of
the
house
and
would
gladly
have
sworn
eighteenth
century
oaths
if
propriety
had
not
frowned
on
such
a
course
excuse
me
miss
leicester
he
said
with
cold
politeness
i
can
not
assist
you
ah
she
said
sadly
i
have
offended
you
in
some
way
tell
me
what
i
have
done
and
i
will
ask
you
to
forgive
me
you
are
mistaken
said
dyson
grabbing
his
hat
but
speaking
with
some
difficulty
you
have
done
nothing
but
as
i
say
i
can
not
help
you
perhaps
he
added
with
some
tinge
of
sarcasm
my
friend
russell
might
be
of
service
thank
you
she
replied
i
will
try
him
and
the
lady
went
off
into
a
shriek
of
laughter
which
filled
up
dyson
cup
of
scandal
and
confusion
he
left
the
house
shortly
afterwards
and
had
the
peculiar
delight
of
a
walk
through
streets
which
slowly
changed
from
black
to
gray
and
from
gray
to
shining
passages
of
glory
for
the
sun
to
brighten
here
and
there
he
met
or
overtook
strayed
revellers
but
he
reflected
that
no
one
could
have
spent
the
night
in
a
more
futile
fashion
than
himself
and
when
he
reached
his
home
he
had
made
resolves
for
reformation
he
decided
that
he
would
abjure
all
milesian
and
arabian
methods
of
entertainment
and
subscribe
to
mudie
for
a
regular
supply
of
mild
and
innocuous
romance
strange
occurrence
in
clerkenwell
dyson
had
inhabited
for
some
years
a
couple
of
rooms
in
a
moderately
quiet
street
in
bloomsbury
where
as
he
somewhat
pompously
expressed
it
he
held
his
finger
on
the
pulse
of
life
without
being
deafened
with
the
thousand
rumors
of
the
main
arteries
of
london
it
was
to
him
a
source
of
peculiar
if
esoteric
gratification
that
from
the
adjacent
corner
of
tottenham
court
road
a
hundred
lines
of
omnibuses
went
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
town
he
would
dilate
on
the
facilities
for
visiting
dalston
and
dwell
on
the
admirable
line
that
knew
extremest
ealing
and
the
streets
beyond
whitechapel
his
rooms
which
had
been
originally
furnished
apartments
he
had
gradually
purged
of
their
more
peccant
parts
and
though
one
would
not
find
here
the
glowing
splendors
of
his
old
chambers
in
the
street
off
the
strand
there
was
something
of
severe
grace
about
the
appointments
which
did
credit
to
his
taste
the
rugs
were
old
and
of
the
true
faded
beauty
the
etchings
nearly
all
of
them
proofs
printed
by
the
artist
made
a
good
show
with
broad
white
margins
and
black
frames
and
there
was
no
spurious
black
oak
indeed
there
was
but
little
furniture
of
any
kind
a
plain
and
honest
table
square
and
sturdy
stood
in
one
corner
a
seventeenth
century
settle
fronted
the
hearth
and
two
wooden
and
a
bookshelf
of
the
empire
made
up
the
equipment
with
an
exception
worthy
of
note
for
dyson
cared
for
none
of
these
things
his
place
was
at
his
own
bureau
a
quaint
old
piece
of
at
which
he
would
sit
for
hour
after
hour
with
his
back
to
the
room
engaged
in
the
desperate
pursuit
of
literature
or
as
he
termed
his
profession
the
chase
of
the
phrase
the
neat
array
of
and
drawers
teemed
and
overflowed
with
manuscript
and
the
experiments
and
efforts
of
many
years
and
the
inner
well
a
vast
and
cavernous
receptacle
was
stuffed
with
accumulated
ideas
dyson
was
a
craftsman
who
gloved
all
the
detail
and
the
technique
of
his
work
intensely
and
if
as
has
been
hinted
he
deluded
himself
a
little
with
the
name
of
artist
yet
his
amusements
were
eminently
harmless
and
so
far
as
can
be
ascertained
he
or
the
publishers
had
chosen
the
good
part
of
not
tiring
the
world
with
printed
matter
here
then
dyson
would
shut
himself
up
with
his
fancies
experimenting
with
words
and
striving
as
his
friend
the
recluse
of
bayswater
strove
with
the
almost
invincible
problem
of
style
but
always
with
a
fine
confidence
extremely
different
from
the
chronic
depression
of
the
realist
he
had
been
almost
continuously
at
work
on
some
scheme
that
struck
him
as
magical
in
its
possibilities
since
the
night
of
his
adventure
with
the
ingenious
tenant
of
the
first
floor
in
abingdon
grove
and
as
he
laid
down
the
pen
with
a
glow
of
triumph
he
reflected
that
he
had
not
viewed
the
streets
for
five
days
in
succession
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
his
accomplished
labor
still
working
in
his
brain
he
put
away
his
papers
and
went
out
pacing
the
pavement
at
first
in
that
rare
mood
of
exultation
which
finds
in
every
stone
upon
the
way
the
possibilities
of
a
masterpiece
it
was
growing
late
and
the
autumn
evening
was
drawing
to
a
close
amidst
veils
of
haze
and
mist
and
in
the
stilled
air
the
voices
and
the
roaring
traffic
and
incessant
feet
seemed
to
dyson
like
the
noise
upon
the
stage
when
all
the
house
is
silent
in
the
square
the
leaves
rippled
down
as
quick
as
summer
rain
and
the
street
beyond
was
beginning
to
flare
with
the
lights
in
the
butcher
shops
and
the
vivid
illumination
of
the
it
was
a
saturday
night
and
the
swarming
populations
of
the
slums
were
turning
out
in
force
the
battered
women
in
rusty
black
had
begun
to
paw
the
lumps
of
cagmag
and
others
gloated
over
unwholesome
cabbages
and
there
was
a
brisk
demand
for
dyson
passed
through
these
with
some
relief
he
loved
to
meditate
but
his
thoughts
were
not
as
de
quincey
after
his
dose
he
cared
not
two
straws
whether
onions
were
dear
or
cheap
and
would
not
have
exulted
if
meat
had
fallen
to
twopence
a
pound
absorbed
in
the
wilderness
of
the
tale
he
had
been
writing
weighing
nicely
the
points
of
plot
and
construction
relishing
the
recollection
of
this
and
that
happy
phrase
and
dreading
failure
here
and
there
he
left
the
rush
and
the
whistle
of
the
behind
him
and
began
to
touch
upon
pavements
more
deserted
he
had
turned
without
taking
note
to
the
northward
and
was
passing
through
an
ancient
fallen
street
where
now
notices
of
floors
and
offices
to
let
hung
out
but
still
about
it
there
was
the
grace
and
the
stiffness
of
the
age
of
wigs
a
broad
roadway
a
broad
pavement
and
on
each
side
a
grave
line
of
houses
with
long
and
narrow
windows
flush
with
the
walls
all
of
mellowed
dyson
walked
with
quick
steps
as
he
resolved
that
short
work
must
be
made
of
a
certain
episode
but
he
was
in
that
happy
humor
of
invention
and
another
chapter
rose
in
the
inner
chamber
of
his
brain
and
he
dwelt
on
the
circumstances
he
was
to
write
down
with
curious
pleasure
it
was
charming
to
have
the
quiet
streets
to
walk
in
and
in
his
thought
he
made
a
whole
district
the
cabinet
of
his
studies
and
vowed
he
would
come
again
heedless
of
his
course
he
struck
off
to
the
east
again
and
soon
found
himself
involved
in
a
squalid
network
of
gray
houses
and
then
in
the
waste
void
and
elements
of
the
passages
and
unmade
roads
behind
great
factory
walls
encumbered
with
the
refuse
of
the
neighborhood
forlorn
and
desperate
a
brief
turn
and
there
rose
before
him
the
unexpected
a
hill
suddenly
lifted
from
the
level
ground
its
steep
ascent
marked
by
the
lighted
lamps
and
eager
as
an
explorer
dyson
found
his
way
to
the
place
wondering
where
his
crooked
paths
had
brought
him
here
all
was
again
decorous
but
hideous
in
the
extreme
the
builder
some
one
lost
in
the
deep
gloom
of
the
early
had
conceived
the
idea
of
twin
villas
in
gray
brick
shaped
in
a
manner
to
recall
the
outlines
of
the
parthenon
each
with
its
classic
form
broadly
marked
with
raised
bands
of
stucco
the
name
of
the
street
was
all
strange
and
for
a
further
surprise
the
top
of
the
hill
was
crowned
with
an
irregular
plot
of
grass
and
fading
trees
called
a
square
and
here
again
the
had
persisted
beyond
the
streets
were
curious
wild
in
their
irregularities
here
a
row
of
sordid
dingy
dwellings
dirty
and
disreputable
in
appearance
and
there
without
warning
stood
a
house
genteel
and
prim
with
wire
blinds
and
brazen
knocker
as
clean
and
trim
as
if
it
had
been
the
doctor
house
in
some
benighted
little
country
town
these
surprises
and
discoveries
began
to
exhaust
dyson
and
he
hailed
with
delight
the
blazing
windows
of
a
and
went
in
with
the
intention
of
testing
the
beverage
provided
for
the
dwellers
in
this
region
as
remote
as
libya
and
pamphylia
and
the
parts
about
mesopotamia
the
babble
of
voices
from
within
warned
him
that
he
was
about
to
assist
at
the
true
parliament
of
the
london
workman
and
he
looked
about
him
for
that
more
retired
entrance
called
private
when
he
had
settled
himself
on
an
exiguous
bench
and
had
ordered
some
beer
he
began
to
listen
to
the
jangling
talk
in
the
public
bar
beyond
it
was
a
senseless
argument
alternately
furious
and
maudlin
with
appeals
to
bill
and
tom
and
mediæval
survivals
of
speech
words
that
chaucer
wrote
belched
out
with
zeal
and
relish
and
the
din
of
pots
jerked
down
and
coppers
rapped
smartly
on
the
zinc
counter
made
a
thorough
bass
for
it
all
dyson
was
calmly
smoking
his
pipe
between
the
sips
of
beer
when
an
indefinite
looking
figure
slid
rather
than
walked
into
the
compartment
the
man
started
violently
when
he
saw
dyson
placidly
sitting
in
the
corner
and
glanced
keenly
about
him
he
seemed
to
be
on
wires
controlled
by
some
electric
machine
for
he
almost
bolted
out
of
the
door
when
the
barman
asked
with
what
he
could
serve
him
and
his
hand
shivered
as
he
took
the
glass
dyson
inspected
him
with
a
little
curiosity
he
was
muffled
up
almost
to
the
lips
and
a
soft
felt
hat
was
drawn
down
over
his
eyes
he
looked
as
if
he
shrank
from
every
glance
and
a
more
raucous
voice
suddenly
uplifted
in
the
public
bar
seemed
to
find
in
him
a
sympathy
that
made
him
shake
and
quiver
like
a
jelly
it
was
pitiable
to
see
any
one
so
thrilled
with
nervousness
and
dyson
was
about
to
address
some
trivial
remark
of
casual
inquiry
to
the
man
when
another
person
came
into
the
compartment
and
laying
a
hand
on
his
arm
muttered
something
in
an
undertone
and
vanished
as
he
came
but
dyson
had
recognized
him
as
the
and
burton
who
had
displayed
so
sumptuous
a
gift
in
lying
and
yet
he
thought
little
of
it
for
his
whole
faculty
of
observation
was
absorbed
in
the
lamentable
and
yet
grotesque
spectacle
before
him
at
the
first
touch
of
the
hand
on
his
arm
the
unfortunate
man
had
wheeled
round
as
if
spun
on
a
pivot
and
shrank
back
with
a
low
piteous
cry
as
if
some
dumb
beast
were
caught
in
the
toils
the
blood
fled
away
from
the
wretch
face
and
the
skin
became
gray
as
if
a
shadow
of
death
had
passed
in
the
air
and
fallen
on
it
and
dyson
caught
a
choking
whisper
davies
for
god
sake
have
pity
on
me
davies
on
my
oath
i
say
and
his
voice
sank
to
silence
as
he
heard
the
message
and
strove
in
vain
to
bite
his
lip
and
summon
up
to
his
aid
some
tinge
of
manhood
he
stood
there
a
moment
wavering
as
the
leaves
of
an
aspen
and
then
he
was
gone
out
into
the
street
as
dyson
thought
silently
with
his
doom
upon
his
head
he
had
not
been
gone
a
minute
when
it
suddenly
flashed
into
dyson
mind
that
he
knew
the
man
it
was
undoubtedly
the
young
man
with
spectacles
for
whom
so
many
ingenious
persons
were
searching
the
spectacles
indeed
were
missing
but
the
pale
face
the
dark
whiskers
and
the
timid
glances
were
enough
to
identify
him
dyson
saw
at
once
that
by
a
succession
of
hazards
he
had
unawares
hit
upon
the
scent
of
some
desperate
conspiracy
wavering
as
the
track
of
a
loathsome
snake
in
and
out
of
the
highways
and
byways
of
the
london
cosmos
the
truth
was
instantly
pictured
before
him
and
he
divined
that
all
unconscious
and
unheeding
he
had
been
privileged
to
see
the
shadows
of
hidden
forms
chasing
and
hurrying
and
grasping
and
vanishing
across
the
bright
curtain
of
common
life
soundless
and
silent
or
only
babbling
fables
and
pretences
for
him
in
an
instant
the
jargoning
of
voices
the
garish
splendor
and
all
the
vulgar
tumult
of
the
became
part
of
magic
for
here
before
his
eyes
a
scene
in
this
grim
mystery
play
had
been
enacted
and
he
had
seen
human
flesh
grow
gray
with
a
palsy
of
fear
the
very
hell
of
cowardice
and
terror
had
gaped
wide
within
an
arm
breadth
in
the
midst
of
these
reflections
the
barman
came
up
and
stared
at
him
as
if
to
hint
that
he
had
exhausted
his
right
to
take
his
ease
and
dyson
bought
another
lease
of
the
seat
by
an
order
for
more
beer
as
he
pondered
the
brief
glimpse
of
tragedy
he
recollected
that
with
his
first
start
of
haunted
fear
the
young
man
with
whiskers
had
drawn
his
hand
swiftly
from
his
great
coat
pocket
and
that
he
had
heard
something
fall
to
the
ground
and
pretending
to
have
dropped
his
pipe
dyson
began
to
grope
in
the
corner
searching
with
his
fingers
he
touched
some
thing
and
drew
it
gently
to
him
and
with
one
brief
glance
as
he
put
it
quietly
in
his
pocket
he
saw
it
was
a
little
note
book
bound
in
faded
green
morocco
he
drank
down
his
beer
at
a
gulp
and
left
the
place
overjoyed
at
his
fortunate
discovery
and
busy
with
conjecture
as
to
the
possible
importance
of
the
find
by
turns
he
dreaded
to
find
perhaps
mere
blank
leaves
or
the
labored
follies
of
a
but
the
faded
morocco
cover
seemed
to
promise
better
things
and
hint
at
mysteries
he
piloted
himself
with
no
little
difficulty
out
of
the
sour
and
squalid
quarter
he
had
entered
with
a
light
heart
and
emerging
at
gray
inn
road
struck
off
down
guilford
street
and
hastened
home
only
anxious
for
a
lighted
candle
and
solitude
dyson
sat
down
at
his
bureau
and
placed
the
little
book
before
him
it
was
an
effort
to
open
the
leaves
and
dare
disappointment
but
in
desperation
at
last
he
laid
his
finger
between
the
pages
at
haphazard
and
rejoiced
to
see
a
compact
range
of
writing
with
a
margin
and
as
it
chanced
three
words
caught
his
glance
and
stood
out
apart
from
the
mass
dyson
read
the
gold
tiberius
and
his
face
flushed
with
fortune
and
the
lust
of
the
hunter
he
turned
at
once
to
the
first
leaf
of
the
and
proceeded
to
read
with
rapt
interest
the
history
of
the
young
man
with
spectacles
from
the
filthy
and
obscure
lodging
situated
i
verily
believe
in
one
of
the
foulest
slums
of
clerkenwell
i
indite
this
history
of
a
life
which
daily
threatened
can
not
last
for
very
much
longer
every
day
nay
every
hour
i
know
too
well
my
enemies
are
drawing
their
nets
closer
about
me
even
now
i
am
condemned
to
be
a
close
prisoner
in
my
squalid
room
and
i
know
that
when
i
go
out
i
shall
go
to
my
destruction
this
history
if
it
chance
to
fall
into
good
hands
may
perhaps
be
of
service
in
warning
young
men
of
the
dangers
and
pitfalls
that
most
surely
must
accompany
any
deviation
from
the
ways
of
rectitude
my
name
is
joseph
walters
when
i
came
of
age
i
found
myself
in
possession
of
a
small
but
sufficient
income
and
i
determined
that
i
would
devote
my
life
to
scholarship
i
do
not
mean
the
scholarship
of
these
days
i
had
no
intention
of
associating
myself
with
men
whose
lives
are
spent
in
the
unspeakably
degrading
occupation
of
editing
classics
befouling
the
fair
margins
of
the
fairest
books
with
idle
and
superfluous
annotation
and
doing
their
utmost
to
give
a
lasting
disgust
of
all
that
is
beautiful
an
abbey
church
turned
to
the
base
use
of
a
stable
or
a
is
a
sorry
sight
but
more
pitiable
still
is
a
masterpiece
spluttered
over
with
the
commentator
pen
and
his
hideous
mark
cf
for
my
part
i
chose
the
glorious
career
of
scholar
in
its
ancient
sense
i
longed
to
possess
encyclopædic
learning
to
grow
old
amongst
books
to
distil
day
by
day
and
year
after
year
the
inmost
sweetness
of
all
worthy
writings
i
was
not
rich
enough
to
collect
a
library
and
i
was
therefore
forced
to
betake
myself
to
the
of
the
british
museum
o
dim
and
mighty
dome
mecca
of
many
minds
mausoleum
of
many
hopes
sad
house
where
all
desires
fail
for
there
men
enter
in
with
hearts
uplifted
and
dreaming
minds
seeing
in
those
exalted
stairs
a
ladder
to
fame
in
that
pompous
portico
the
gate
of
knowledge
and
going
in
find
but
vain
vanity
and
all
but
in
vain
there
when
the
long
streets
are
ringing
is
silence
there
eternal
twilight
and
the
odor
of
heaviness
but
there
the
blood
flows
thin
and
cold
and
the
brain
burns
adust
there
is
the
hunt
of
shadows
and
the
chase
of
embattled
phantoms
a
striving
against
ghosts
and
a
war
that
has
no
victory
o
dome
tomb
of
the
quick
surely
in
thy
galleries
where
no
reverberant
voice
can
call
sighs
whisper
ever
and
mutterings
of
dead
hopes
and
there
men
souls
mount
like
moths
towards
the
flame
and
fall
scorched
and
blackened
beneath
thee
o
dim
and
mighty
dome
bitterly
do
i
now
regret
the
day
when
i
took
my
place
at
a
desk
for
the
first
time
and
began
my
studies
i
had
not
been
an
habitué
of
the
place
for
many
months
when
i
became
acquainted
with
a
serene
and
benevolent
gentleman
a
man
somewhat
past
middle
age
who
nearly
always
occupied
a
desk
next
to
mine
in
the
it
takes
little
to
make
an
acquaintance
a
casual
offer
of
assistance
a
hint
as
to
the
search
in
the
catalogue
and
the
ordinary
politeness
of
men
who
constantly
sit
near
each
other
it
was
thus
i
came
to
know
the
man
calling
himself
lipsius
by
degrees
i
grew
to
look
for
his
presence
and
to
miss
him
when
he
was
away
as
was
sometimes
the
case
and
so
a
friendship
sprang
up
between
us
his
immense
range
of
learning
was
placed
freely
at
my
service
he
would
often
astonish
me
by
the
way
in
which
he
would
sketch
out
in
a
few
minutes
the
bibliography
of
a
given
subject
and
before
long
i
had
confided
to
him
my
ambitions
ah
he
said
you
should
have
been
a
german
i
was
like
that
myself
when
i
was
a
boy
it
is
a
wonderful
resolve
an
infinite
career
will
know
all
things
yes
it
is
a
device
indeed
but
it
means
this
a
life
of
labor
without
end
and
a
desire
unsatisfied
at
last
the
scholar
has
to
die
and
die
saying
know
very
little
gradually
by
speeches
such
as
these
lipsius
seduced
me
he
would
praise
the
career
and
at
the
same
time
hint
that
it
was
as
hopeless
as
the
search
for
the
philosopher
stone
and
so
by
artful
suggestions
insinuated
with
infinite
address
he
by
degrees
succeeded
in
undermining
all
my
principles
after
all
he
used
to
say
the
greatest
of
all
sciences
the
key
to
all
knowledge
is
the
science
and
art
of
pleasure
rabelais
was
perhaps
the
greatest
of
all
the
encyclopædic
scholars
and
he
as
you
know
wrote
the
most
remarkable
book
that
has
ever
been
written
and
what
does
he
teach
men
in
this
book
surely
the
joy
of
living
i
need
not
remind
you
of
the
words
suppressed
in
most
of
the
editions
the
key
of
all
the
rabelaisian
mythology
of
all
the
enigmas
of
his
grand
philosophy
there
you
have
all
his
learning
his
work
is
the
institutes
of
pleasure
as
the
fine
art
the
finest
art
there
is
the
art
of
all
arts
rabelais
had
all
science
but
he
had
all
life
too
and
we
have
gone
a
long
way
since
his
time
you
are
enlightened
i
think
you
do
not
consider
all
the
petty
rules
and
that
a
corrupt
society
has
made
for
its
own
selfish
convenience
as
the
immutable
decrees
of
the
eternal
such
were
the
doctrines
that
he
preached
and
it
was
by
such
insidious
arguments
line
upon
line
here
a
little
and
there
a
little
that
he
at
last
succeeded
in
making
me
a
man
at
war
with
the
whole
social
system
i
used
to
long
for
some
opportunity
to
break
the
chains
and
to
live
a
free
life
to
be
my
own
rule
and
measure
i
viewed
existence
with
the
eyes
of
a
pagan
and
lipsius
understood
to
perfection
the
art
of
stimulating
the
natural
inclinations
of
a
young
man
hitherto
a
hermit
as
i
gazed
up
at
the
great
dome
i
saw
it
flushed
with
the
flames
and
colors
of
a
world
of
enticement
unknown
to
me
my
imagination
played
me
a
thousand
wanton
tricks
and
the
forbidden
drew
me
as
surely
as
a
loadstone
draws
on
iron
at
last
my
resolution
was
taken
and
i
boldly
asked
lipsius
to
be
my
guide
he
told
me
to
leave
the
museum
at
my
usual
hour
half
past
four
to
walk
slowly
along
the
northern
pavement
of
great
russell
street
and
to
wait
at
the
corner
of
the
street
till
i
was
addressed
and
then
to
obey
in
all
things
the
instructions
of
the
person
who
came
up
to
me
i
carried
out
these
directions
and
stood
at
the
corner
looking
about
me
anxiously
my
heart
beating
fast
and
my
breath
coming
in
gasps
i
waited
there
for
some
time
and
had
begun
to
fear
i
had
been
made
the
object
of
a
joke
when
i
suddenly
became
conscious
of
a
gentleman
who
was
looking
at
me
with
evident
amusement
from
the
opposite
pavement
of
tottenham
court
road
he
came
over
and
raising
his
hat
politely
begged
me
to
follow
him
and
i
did
so
without
a
word
wondering
where
we
were
going
and
what
was
to
happen
i
was
taken
to
a
house
of
quiet
and
respectable
aspect
in
a
street
lying
to
the
north
of
oxford
street
and
my
guide
rang
the
bell
and
a
servant
showed
us
into
a
large
room
quietly
furnished
on
the
ground
floor
we
sat
there
in
silence
for
some
time
and
i
noticed
that
the
furniture
though
unpretending
was
extremely
valuable
there
were
large
two
of
extreme
elegance
and
in
one
corner
a
carved
chest
which
must
have
been
mediæval
presently
lipsius
came
in
and
welcomed
me
with
his
usual
manner
and
after
some
desultory
conversation
my
guide
left
the
room
then
an
elderly
man
dropped
in
and
began
talking
to
lipsius
and
from
their
conversation
i
understood
that
my
friend
was
a
dealer
in
antiques
they
spoke
of
the
hittite
seal
and
of
the
prospects
of
further
discoveries
and
later
when
two
or
three
more
persons
had
joined
us
there
was
an
argument
as
to
the
possibility
of
a
systematic
exploration
of
the
monuments
in
england
i
was
in
fact
present
at
an
archæological
reception
of
an
informal
kind
and
at
nine
when
the
antiquaries
were
gone
i
stared
at
lipsius
in
a
manner
that
showed
i
was
puzzled
and
sought
an
explanation
now
he
said
we
will
go
upstairs
as
we
passed
up
the
stairs
lipsius
lighting
the
way
with
a
i
heard
the
sound
of
a
jarring
lock
and
bolts
and
bars
shot
on
at
the
front
door
my
guide
drew
back
a
baize
door
and
we
went
down
a
passage
and
i
began
to
hear
odd
sounds
a
noise
of
curious
mirth
and
then
he
pushed
me
through
a
second
door
and
my
initiation
began
i
can
not
write
down
what
i
witnessed
that
night
i
can
not
bear
to
recall
what
went
on
in
those
secret
rooms
fast
shuttered
and
curtained
so
that
no
light
should
escape
into
the
quiet
street
they
gave
me
red
wine
to
drink
and
a
woman
told
me
as
i
sipped
it
that
it
was
wine
of
the
red
jar
that
avallaunius
had
made
another
asked
me
how
i
liked
the
wine
of
the
fauns
and
i
heard
a
dozen
fantastic
names
while
the
stuff
boiled
in
my
veins
and
stirred
i
think
something
that
had
slept
within
me
from
the
moment
i
was
born
it
seemed
as
if
my
deserted
me
i
was
no
longer
a
thinking
agent
but
at
once
subject
and
object
i
mingled
in
the
horrible
sport
and
watched
the
mystery
of
the
greek
groves
and
fountains
enacted
before
me
saw
the
reeling
dance
and
heard
the
music
calling
as
i
sat
beside
my
mate
and
yet
i
was
outside
it
all
and
viewed
my
own
part
an
idle
spectator
thus
with
strange
rites
they
made
me
drink
the
cup
and
when
i
woke
up
in
the
morning
i
was
one
of
them
and
had
sworn
to
be
faithful
at
first
i
was
shown
the
enticing
side
of
things
i
was
bidden
to
enjoy
myself
and
care
for
nothing
but
pleasure
and
lipsius
himself
indicated
to
me
as
the
acutest
enjoyment
the
spectacle
of
the
terrors
of
the
unfortunate
persons
who
were
from
time
to
time
decoyed
into
the
evil
house
but
after
a
time
it
was
pointed
out
to
me
that
i
must
take
my
share
in
the
work
and
so
i
found
myself
compelled
to
be
in
my
turn
a
seducer
and
thus
it
is
on
my
conscience
that
i
have
led
many
to
the
depths
of
the
pit
one
day
lipsius
summoned
me
to
his
private
room
and
told
me
that
he
had
a
difficult
task
to
give
me
he
unlocked
a
drawer
and
gave
me
a
sheet
of
paper
and
had
me
read
it
it
was
without
place
or
date
or
signature
and
ran
as
follows
james
headley
will
receive
from
his
agent
in
armenia
on
the
a
unique
coin
the
gold
tiberius
it
hears
on
the
reverse
a
faun
with
the
legend
victoria
it
is
believed
that
this
coin
is
of
immense
value
headley
will
come
up
to
town
to
show
the
coin
to
his
friend
professor
memys
of
chenies
street
oxford
street
on
some
date
between
the
and
the
lipsius
chuckled
at
my
face
of
blank
surprise
when
i
laid
down
this
singular
communication
you
will
have
a
good
chance
of
showing
your
discretion
he
said
this
is
not
a
common
case
it
requires
great
management
and
infinite
tact
i
am
sure
i
wish
i
had
a
panurge
in
my
service
but
we
will
see
what
you
can
do
but
is
it
not
a
joke
i
asked
him
how
can
you
know
or
rather
how
can
this
correspondent
of
yours
know
that
a
coin
has
been
despatched
from
armenia
to
headley
and
how
is
it
possible
to
fix
the
period
in
which
headley
will
take
it
into
his
head
to
come
up
to
town
it
seems
to
me
a
lot
of
guess
work
my
dear
walters
he
replied
we
do
not
deal
in
guess
work
here
it
would
bore
you
if
i
went
into
all
these
little
details
the
cogs
and
wheels
if
i
may
say
so
which
move
the
machine
do
you
think
it
is
much
more
amusing
to
sit
in
front
of
the
house
and
be
astonished
than
to
be
behind
the
scenes
and
see
the
mechanism
better
tremble
at
the
thunder
believe
me
than
see
the
man
rolling
the
cannon
ball
but
after
all
you
need
bother
about
the
how
and
why
you
have
your
share
to
do
of
course
i
shall
give
you
full
instructions
but
a
great
deal
depends
on
the
way
the
thing
is
carried
out
i
have
often
heard
very
young
men
maintain
that
style
is
everything
in
literature
and
i
can
assure
you
that
the
same
maxim
holds
good
in
our
far
more
delicate
profession
with
us
style
is
absolutely
everything
and
that
is
why
we
have
friends
like
yourself
i
went
away
in
some
perturbation
he
had
no
doubt
designedly
left
everything
in
mystery
and
i
did
not
know
what
part
i
should
have
to
play
though
i
had
assisted
at
scenes
of
hideous
revelry
i
was
not
yet
dead
to
all
echo
of
human
feeling
and
i
trembled
lest
i
should
receive
the
order
to
be
headley
executioner
a
week
later
it
was
on
the
sixteenth
of
the
month
lipsius
made
me
a
sign
to
come
into
his
room
it
is
for
he
began
please
to
attend
carefully
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
walters
and
on
peril
of
your
life
for
it
is
a
dangerous
matter
on
peril
of
your
life
i
say
follow
these
instructions
to
the
letter
you
understand
well
at
about
seven
you
will
stroll
quietly
up
the
hampstead
road
till
you
come
to
vincent
street
turn
down
here
and
walk
along
taking
the
third
turning
to
your
right
which
is
lambert
terrace
then
follow
the
terrace
cross
the
road
and
go
along
hertford
street
and
so
into
lillington
square
the
second
turning
you
will
come
to
in
the
square
is
called
sheen
street
but
in
reality
it
is
more
a
passage
between
blank
walls
than
a
street
whatever
you
do
take
care
to
be
at
the
corner
of
this
street
at
eight
precisely
you
will
walk
along
it
and
just
at
the
bend
where
you
lose
sight
of
the
square
you
will
find
an
old
gentleman
with
white
beard
and
whiskers
he
will
in
all
probability
be
abusing
a
cabman
for
having
brought
him
to
sheen
street
instead
of
chenies
street
you
will
go
up
to
him
quietly
and
offer
your
services
he
will
tell
you
where
he
wants
to
go
and
you
will
be
so
courteous
as
to
offer
to
show
him
the
way
i
may
say
that
professor
memys
moved
into
chenies
street
a
month
ago
thus
headley
has
never
been
to
see
him
there
and
moreover
he
is
very
and
knows
little
of
the
topography
of
london
indeed
he
has
quite
lived
the
life
of
a
learned
hermit
at
audley
hall
well
need
i
say
more
to
a
man
of
your
intelligence
you
will
bring
him
to
this
house
he
will
ring
the
bell
and
a
servant
in
quiet
livery
will
let
him
in
then
your
work
will
be
done
and
i
am
sure
done
well
you
will
leave
headley
at
the
door
and
simply
continue
your
walk
and
i
shall
hope
to
see
you
the
next
day
i
really
do
think
there
is
anything
more
i
can
tell
you
these
minute
instructions
i
took
care
to
carry
out
to
the
letter
i
confess
that
i
walked
up
the
tottenham
court
road
by
no
means
blindly
but
with
an
uneasy
sense
that
i
was
coming
to
a
decisive
point
in
my
life
the
noise
and
rumor
of
the
crowded
pavements
were
to
me
but
i
revolved
again
and
again
in
ceaseless
iteration
the
task
that
had
been
laid
on
me
and
i
questioned
myself
as
to
the
possible
results
as
i
got
near
the
point
of
turning
i
asked
myself
whether
danger
were
not
about
my
steps
the
cold
thought
struck
me
that
i
was
suspected
and
observed
and
every
chance
who
gave
me
a
second
glance
seemed
to
me
an
officer
of
police
my
time
was
running
out
the
sky
had
darkened
and
i
hesitated
half
resolved
to
go
no
farther
but
to
abandon
lipsius
and
his
friends
forever
i
had
almost
determined
to
take
this
course
when
the
conviction
suddenly
came
to
me
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
gigantic
joke
a
fabrication
of
rank
improbability
who
could
have
procured
the
information
about
the
armenian
agent
i
asked
myself
by
what
means
could
lipsius
have
known
the
particular
day
and
the
very
train
that
headley
was
to
take
how
engage
him
to
enter
one
special
cab
amongst
the
dozens
waiting
at
paddington
i
vowed
it
a
mere
milesian
tale
and
went
forward
merrily
and
turned
down
vincent
street
and
threaded
out
the
route
that
lipsius
had
so
carefully
impressed
upon
me
the
various
streets
he
had
named
were
all
places
of
silence
and
an
oppressive
cheap
gentility
it
was
dark
and
i
felt
alone
in
the
musty
squares
and
crescents
where
people
pattered
by
at
intervals
and
the
shadows
were
growing
blacker
i
entered
sheen
street
and
found
it
as
lipsius
had
said
more
a
passage
than
a
street
it
was
a
on
one
side
a
low
wall
and
neglected
gardens
and
grim
backs
of
a
line
of
houses
and
on
the
other
a
timber
yard
i
turned
the
corner
and
lost
sight
of
the
square
and
then
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
the
scene
of
which
i
had
been
told
a
hansom
cab
had
come
to
a
stop
beside
the
pavement
and
an
old
man
carrying
a
handbag
was
fiercely
abusing
the
cabman
who
sat
on
his
perch
the
image
of
bewilderment
yes
but
i
sure
you
said
sheen
street
and
that
where
i
brought
you
i
heard
him
saying
as
i
came
up
and
the
old
gentleman
boiled
in
a
fury
and
threatened
police
and
suits
at
law
the
sight
gave
me
a
shock
and
in
an
instant
i
resolved
to
go
through
with
it
i
strolled
on
and
without
noticing
the
cabman
lifted
my
hat
politely
to
old
headley
pardon
me
sir
i
said
but
is
there
any
difficulty
i
see
you
are
a
traveller
perhaps
the
cabman
has
made
a
mistake
can
i
direct
you
the
old
fellow
turned
to
me
and
i
noticed
that
he
snarled
and
showed
his
teeth
like
an
cur
as
he
spoke
this
drunken
fool
has
brought
me
here
he
said
i
told
him
to
drive
to
chenies
street
and
he
brings
me
to
this
infernal
place
i
wo
pay
him
a
farthing
and
i
meant
to
have
given
him
a
handsome
sum
i
am
going
to
call
for
the
police
and
give
him
in
charge
at
this
threat
the
cabman
seemed
to
take
alarm
he
glanced
round
as
if
to
make
sure
that
no
policeman
was
in
sight
and
drove
off
grumbling
loudly
and
headley
grinned
savagely
with
satisfaction
at
having
saved
his
fare
and
put
back
one
and
sixpence
into
his
pocket
the
handsome
sum
the
cabman
had
lost
my
dear
sir
i
said
i
am
afraid
this
piece
of
stupidity
has
annoyed
you
a
great
deal
it
is
a
long
way
to
chenies
street
and
you
will
have
some
difficulty
in
finding
the
place
unless
you
know
london
pretty
well
i
know
it
very
little
he
replied
i
never
come
up
except
on
important
business
and
i
never
been
to
chenies
street
in
my
life
really
i
should
be
happy
to
show
you
the
way
i
have
been
for
a
stroll
and
it
will
not
at
all
inconvenience
me
to
take
you
to
your
destination
i
want
to
go
to
professor
memys
at
number
it
most
annoying
to
me
i
and
i
can
never
make
out
the
numbers
on
the
doors
this
way
if
you
please
i
said
and
we
set
out
i
did
not
find
headley
an
agreeable
man
indeed
he
grumbled
the
whole
way
he
informed
me
of
his
name
and
i
took
care
to
say
the
antiquary
and
thenceforth
i
was
compelled
to
listen
to
the
history
of
his
complicated
squabbles
with
publishers
who
had
treated
him
as
he
said
disgracefully
the
man
was
a
chapter
in
the
irritability
of
authors
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
making
the
fortune
of
several
firms
but
had
been
compelled
to
abandon
the
design
owing
to
their
rank
ingratitude
besides
these
ancient
histories
of
wrong
and
the
more
recent
misadventure
of
the
cabman
he
had
another
grievous
complaint
to
make
as
he
came
along
in
the
train
he
had
been
sharpening
a
pencil
and
the
sudden
jolt
of
the
engine
as
it
drew
up
at
a
station
had
driven
the
penknife
against
his
face
inflicting
a
small
triangular
wound
just
on
the
which
he
showed
me
he
denounced
the
railway
company
and
heaped
imprecations
on
the
head
of
the
driver
and
talked
of
claiming
damages
thus
he
grumbled
all
the
way
not
noticing
in
the
least
where
he
was
going
and
so
inamiable
did
his
conduct
appear
to
me
that
i
began
to
enjoy
the
trick
i
was
playing
on
him
nevertheless
my
heart
beat
a
little
faster
as
we
turned
into
the
street
where
lipsius
was
waiting
a
thousand
accidents
i
thought
might
happen
some
chance
might
bring
one
of
headley
friends
to
meet
us
perhaps
though
he
knew
not
chenies
street
he
might
know
the
street
where
i
was
taking
him
in
spite
of
his
he
might
possibly
make
out
the
number
or
in
a
sudden
fit
of
suspicion
he
might
make
an
inquiry
of
the
policeman
at
the
corner
thus
every
step
upon
the
pavement
as
we
drew
nearer
to
the
goal
was
to
me
a
pang
and
a
terror
and
every
approaching
passenger
carried
a
certain
threat
of
danger
i
gulped
down
my
excitement
with
an
effort
and
made
shift
to
say
pretty
quietly
no
i
think
you
said
that
is
the
third
house
from
this
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
leave
you
now
i
have
been
delayed
a
little
and
my
way
lies
on
the
other
side
of
tottenham
court
road
he
snarled
out
some
kind
of
thanks
and
i
turned
my
back
and
walked
swiftly
in
the
opposite
direction
a
minute
or
two
later
i
looked
round
and
saw
headley
standing
on
the
doorstep
and
then
the
door
opened
and
he
went
in
for
my
part
i
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
hastened
to
get
away
from
the
neighborhood
and
endeavored
to
enjoy
myself
in
merry
company
the
whole
of
the
next
day
i
kept
away
from
lipsius
i
felt
anxious
but
i
did
not
know
what
had
happened
or
what
was
happening
and
a
reasonable
regard
for
my
own
safety
told
me
that
i
should
do
well
to
remain
quietly
at
home
my
curiosity
however
to
learn
the
end
of
the
odd
drama
in
which
i
had
played
a
part
stung
me
to
the
quick
and
late
in
the
evening
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
and
see
how
events
had
turned
out
lipsius
nodded
when
i
came
in
and
asked
me
if
i
could
give
him
five
talk
we
went
into
his
room
and
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
and
i
sat
waiting
for
him
to
speak
my
dear
walters
he
said
at
length
i
congratulate
you
warmly
your
work
was
done
in
the
most
thorough
and
artistic
manner
you
will
go
far
look
he
went
to
his
escritoire
and
pressed
a
secret
spring
and
a
drawer
flew
out
and
he
laid
something
on
the
table
it
was
a
gold
coin
and
i
took
it
up
and
examined
it
eagerly
and
read
the
legend
about
the
figure
of
the
faun
victoria
i
said
smiling
yes
it
was
a
great
capture
which
we
owe
to
you
i
had
great
difficulty
in
persuading
headley
that
a
little
mistake
had
been
made
that
was
how
i
put
it
he
was
very
disagreeable
and
indeed
ungentlemanly
about
it
did
he
strike
you
as
a
very
cross
old
man
i
held
the
coin
admiring
the
choice
and
rare
design
clear
cut
as
if
from
the
mint
and
i
thought
the
fine
gold
glowed
and
burned
like
a
lamp
and
what
finally
became
of
mr
headley
i
said
at
last
lipsius
smiled
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
on
earth
does
it
matter
he
said
he
might
be
here
or
there
or
anywhere
but
what
possible
consequence
could
it
be
besides
your
question
rather
surprises
me
you
are
an
intelligent
man
walters
just
think
it
over
and
i
sure
you
wo
repeat
the
question
my
dear
sir
i
said
i
hardly
think
you
are
treating
me
fairly
you
have
paid
me
some
handsome
compliments
on
my
share
in
the
capture
and
i
naturally
wish
to
know
how
the
matter
ended
from
what
i
saw
of
headley
i
should
think
you
must
have
had
some
difficulty
with
him
he
gave
me
no
answer
for
the
moment
but
began
again
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
apparently
absorbed
in
thought
well
he
said
at
last
i
suppose
there
is
something
in
what
you
say
we
are
certainly
indebted
to
you
i
have
said
that
i
have
a
high
opinion
of
your
intelligence
walters
just
look
here
will
you
he
opened
a
door
communicating
with
another
room
and
pointed
there
was
a
great
box
lying
on
the
floor
a
queer
thing
i
looked
at
it
and
saw
it
was
a
mummy
case
like
those
in
the
british
museum
vividly
painted
in
the
brilliant
egyptian
colors
with
i
knew
not
what
proclamation
of
dignity
or
hopes
of
life
immortal
the
mummy
swathed
about
in
the
robes
of
death
was
lying
within
and
the
face
had
been
uncovered
you
are
going
to
send
this
away
i
said
forgetting
the
question
i
had
put
yes
i
have
an
order
from
a
local
museum
look
a
little
more
closely
mr
walters
puzzled
by
his
manner
i
peered
into
the
face
while
he
held
up
the
lamp
the
flesh
was
black
with
the
passing
of
the
centuries
but
as
i
looked
i
saw
upon
the
right
a
small
triangular
scar
and
the
secret
of
the
mummy
flashed
upon
me
i
was
looking
at
the
dead
body
of
the
man
whom
i
had
decoyed
into
that
house
there
was
no
thought
or
design
of
action
in
my
mind
i
held
the
accursed
coin
in
my
hand
burning
me
with
a
foretaste
of
hell
and
i
fled
as
i
would
have
fled
from
pestilence
and
death
and
dashed
into
the
street
in
blind
horror
not
knowing
where
i
went
i
felt
the
gold
coin
grasped
in
my
clenched
list
and
threw
it
away
i
knew
not
where
and
ran
on
and
on
through
and
dark
ways
till
at
last
i
issued
out
into
a
crowded
thoroughfare
and
checked
myself
then
as
consciousness
returned
i
realized
my
instant
peril
and
understood
what
would
happen
if
i
fell
into
the
hands
of
lipsius
i
knew
that
i
had
put
forth
my
finger
to
thwart
a
relentless
mechanism
rather
than
a
man
my
recent
adventure
with
the
unfortunate
headley
had
taught
me
that
lipsius
had
agents
in
all
quarters
and
i
foresaw
that
if
i
fell
into
his
hands
he
would
remain
true
to
his
doctrine
of
style
and
cause
me
to
die
a
death
of
some
horrible
and
ingenious
torture
i
bent
my
whole
mind
to
the
task
of
outwitting
him
and
his
emissaries
three
of
whom
i
knew
to
have
proved
their
ability
for
tracking
down
persons
who
for
various
reasons
preferred
to
remain
obscure
these
servants
of
lipsius
were
two
men
and
a
woman
and
the
woman
was
incomparably
the
most
subtle
and
the
most
deadly
yet
i
considered
that
i
too
had
some
portion
of
craft
and
i
took
my
resolve
since
then
i
have
matched
myself
day
by
day
and
hour
by
hour
against
the
ingenuity
of
lipsius
and
his
myrmidons
for
a
time
i
was
successful
though
they
beat
furiously
after
me
in
the
covert
of
london
i
remained
and
watched
with
some
amusement
their
frantic
efforts
to
recover
the
scent
lost
in
two
or
three
minutes
every
lure
and
wile
was
put
forth
to
entice
me
from
my
i
was
informed
by
the
medium
of
the
public
prints
that
what
i
had
taken
had
been
recovered
and
meetings
were
proposed
in
which
i
might
hope
to
gain
a
great
deal
without
the
slightest
risk
i
laughed
at
their
endeavors
and
began
a
little
to
despise
the
organization
i
had
so
dreaded
and
ventured
more
abroad
not
once
or
twice
but
several
times
i
recognized
the
two
men
who
were
charged
with
my
capture
and
i
succeeded
in
eluding
them
easily
at
close
quarters
and
a
little
hastily
i
decided
that
i
had
nothing
to
dread
and
that
my
craft
was
greater
than
theirs
but
in
the
mean
while
while
i
congratulated
myself
on
my
cunning
the
third
of
lipsius
emissaries
was
weaving
her
nets
and
in
an
evil
hour
i
paid
a
visit
to
an
old
friend
a
literary
man
named
russell
who
lived
in
a
quiet
street
in
bayswater
the
woman
as
i
found
out
too
late
a
day
or
two
ago
occupied
rooms
in
the
same
house
and
i
was
followed
and
tracked
down
too
late
as
i
have
said
i
recognized
that
i
had
made
a
fatal
mistake
and
that
i
was
besieged
sooner
or
later
i
shall
find
myself
in
the
power
of
an
enemy
without
pity
and
so
surely
as
i
leave
this
house
i
shall
go
to
receive
doom
i
hardly
dare
to
guess
how
it
will
at
last
fall
upon
me
my
imagination
always
a
vivid
one
paints
to
me
appalling
pictures
of
the
unspeakable
torture
which
i
shall
probably
endure
and
i
know
that
i
shall
die
with
lipsius
standing
near
and
gloating
over
the
refinements
of
my
suffering
and
my
shame
hours
nay
minutes
have
become
very
precious
to
me
i
sometimes
pause
in
the
midst
of
anticipating
my
tortures
to
wonder
whether
even
now
i
can
not
hit
upon
some
supreme
stroke
some
design
of
infinite
subtlety
to
free
myself
from
the
toils
but
i
find
that
the
faculty
of
combination
has
left
me
i
am
as
the
scholar
in
the
old
myth
deserted
by
the
power
which
has
helped
me
hitherto
i
do
not
know
when
the
supreme
moment
will
come
but
sooner
or
later
it
is
inevitable
and
before
long
i
shall
receive
sentence
and
from
the
sentence
to
execution
will
not
be
long
i
can
not
remain
here
a
prisoner
any
longer
i
shall
go
out
when
the
streets
are
full
of
crowds
and
clamors
and
make
a
last
effort
to
escape
it
was
with
profound
astonishment
that
dyson
closed
the
little
book
and
thought
of
the
strange
series
of
incidents
which
had
brought
him
into
touch
with
the
plots
and
counterplots
connected
with
the
gold
tiberius
he
had
bestowed
the
coin
carefully
away
and
he
shuddered
at
the
bare
possibility
of
its
place
of
deposit
becoming
known
to
the
evil
band
who
seemed
to
possess
such
extraordinary
sources
of
information
it
had
grown
late
while
he
read
and
he
put
the
away
hoping
with
all
his
heart
that
the
unhappy
walters
might
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
escape
the
doom
he
dreaded
adventure
of
the
deserted
residence
a
wonderful
story
as
you
say
an
extraordinary
sequence
and
play
of
coincidence
i
confess
that
your
expressions
when
you
first
showed
me
the
gold
tiberius
were
not
exaggerated
but
do
you
think
that
walters
has
really
some
fearful
fate
to
dread
i
can
not
say
who
can
presume
to
predict
events
when
life
itself
puts
on
the
robe
of
coincidence
and
plays
at
drama
perhaps
we
have
not
yet
reached
the
last
chapter
in
the
queer
story
but
look
we
are
drawing
near
to
the
verge
of
london
there
are
gaps
you
see
in
the
serried
ranks
of
brick
and
a
vision
of
green
fields
beyond
dyson
had
persuaded
the
ingenious
phillipps
to
accompany
him
on
one
of
those
aimless
walks
to
which
he
was
himself
so
addicted
starting
from
the
very
heart
of
london
they
had
made
their
way
westward
through
the
stony
avenues
and
were
now
just
emerging
from
the
red
lines
of
an
extreme
suburb
and
presently
the
road
ended
a
quiet
lane
began
and
they
were
beneath
the
shade
of
the
yellow
autumn
sunlight
that
had
lit
up
the
bare
distance
of
the
suburban
street
now
filtered
down
through
the
boughs
of
the
trees
and
shone
on
the
glowing
carpet
of
fallen
leaves
and
the
pools
of
rain
glittered
and
shot
back
the
gleam
of
light
over
all
the
broad
pastures
there
was
peace
and
the
happy
rest
of
autumn
before
the
great
winds
begin
and
afar
off
london
lay
all
vague
and
immense
amidst
the
veiling
mist
here
and
there
a
distant
window
catching
the
sun
and
kindling
with
fire
and
a
spire
gleaming
high
and
below
the
streets
in
shadow
and
the
turmoil
of
life
dyson
and
phillipps
walked
on
in
silence
beneath
the
high
hedges
till
at
a
turn
of
the
lane
they
saw
a
mouldering
and
ancient
gate
standing
open
and
the
prospect
of
a
house
at
the
end
of
a
carriage
drive
there
is
a
survival
for
you
said
dyson
it
has
come
to
its
last
days
i
imagine
look
how
the
laurels
have
grown
gaunt
and
weedy
and
black
and
bare
beneath
look
at
the
house
covered
with
yellow
wash
and
patched
with
green
damp
why
the
very
which
informs
all
and
singular
that
the
place
is
to
be
let
has
cracked
and
half
fallen
suppose
we
go
in
and
see
it
said
phillipps
i
do
think
there
is
anybody
about
they
turned
up
the
drive
and
walked
slowly
towards
this
remnant
of
old
days
it
was
a
large
straggling
house
with
curved
wings
at
either
end
and
behind
a
series
of
irregular
roofs
and
projections
showing
that
the
place
had
been
added
to
at
divers
dates
the
two
wings
were
roofed
in
cupola
fashion
and
at
one
side
as
they
came
nearer
they
could
see
a
and
a
clock
turret
with
a
bell
and
the
dark
masses
of
gloomy
cedars
amidst
all
the
lineaments
of
dissolution
there
was
but
one
note
of
contrast
the
sun
was
setting
beyond
the
and
all
the
west
and
the
south
were
in
flames
and
on
the
upper
windows
of
the
house
the
glow
shone
reflected
and
it
seemed
as
if
blood
and
fire
were
mingled
before
the
yellow
front
of
the
mansion
stained
as
dyson
had
remarked
with
gangrenous
patches
green
and
blackening
stretched
what
once
had
been
no
doubt
a
lawn
but
it
was
now
rough
and
ragged
and
nettles
and
great
docks
and
all
manner
of
coarse
weeds
struggled
in
the
places
of
the
the
urns
had
fallen
from
their
pillars
beside
the
walk
and
lay
broken
in
shards
upon
the
ground
and
everywhere
from
and
path
a
fungoid
growth
had
sprung
up
and
multiplied
and
lay
dank
and
slimy
like
a
festering
sore
upon
the
earth
in
the
middle
of
the
rank
grass
of
the
lawn
was
a
desolate
fountain
the
rim
of
the
basin
was
crumbling
and
pulverized
with
decay
and
within
the
water
stood
stagnant
with
green
scum
for
the
lilies
that
had
once
bloomed
there
and
rust
had
eaten
into
the
bronze
flesh
of
the
triton
that
stood
in
the
middle
and
the
he
held
was
broken
here
said
dyson
one
might
moralize
over
decay
and
death
here
all
the
stage
is
decked
out
with
the
symbols
of
dissolution
the
cedarn
gloom
and
twilight
hangs
heavy
around
us
and
everywhere
within
the
pale
dankness
has
found
a
harbor
and
the
very
air
is
changed
and
brought
to
accord
with
the
scene
to
me
i
confess
this
deserted
house
is
as
moral
as
a
graveyard
and
i
find
something
sublime
in
that
lonely
triton
deserted
in
the
midst
of
his
he
is
the
last
of
the
gods
they
have
left
him
and
he
remembers
the
sound
of
water
falling
on
water
and
the
days
that
were
sweet
i
like
your
reflections
extremely
said
phillipps
but
i
may
mention
that
the
door
of
the
house
is
let
us
go
in
then
the
door
was
just
ajar
and
they
passed
into
the
mouldy
hall
and
looked
in
at
a
room
on
one
side
it
was
a
large
room
going
far
back
and
the
rich
old
red
flock
paper
was
peeling
from
the
walls
in
long
strips
and
blackened
with
vague
patches
of
rising
damp
the
ancient
clay
the
dank
reeking
earth
rising
up
again
and
subduing
all
the
work
of
men
hands
after
the
conquest
of
many
years
and
the
floor
was
thick
with
the
dust
of
decay
and
the
painted
ceiling
fading
from
all
gay
colors
and
light
fancies
of
cupids
in
a
career
and
disfigured
with
sores
of
dampness
seemed
transmuted
into
other
work
no
longer
the
amorini
chased
one
another
pleasantly
with
limbs
that
sought
not
to
advance
and
hands
that
merely
simulated
the
act
of
grasping
at
the
wreathed
flowers
but
it
appeared
some
savage
burlesque
of
the
old
careless
world
and
of
its
cherished
conventions
and
the
dance
of
the
loves
had
become
a
dance
of
death
black
pustules
and
festering
sores
swelled
and
clustered
on
fair
limbs
and
smiling
faces
showed
corruption
and
the
fairy
blood
had
boiled
with
the
germs
of
foul
disease
it
was
a
parable
of
the
leaven
working
and
worms
devouring
for
a
banquet
the
heart
of
the
rose
strangely
under
the
painted
ceiling
against
the
decaying
walls
two
old
chairs
still
stood
alone
the
sole
furniture
of
the
empty
place
with
curving
arms
and
twisted
legs
covered
with
faded
gold
leaf
and
upholstered
in
tattered
damask
they
too
were
a
part
of
the
symbolism
and
struck
dyson
with
surprise
what
have
we
here
he
said
who
has
sat
in
these
chairs
who
clad
in
satin
with
lace
ruffles
and
diamond
buckles
all
golden
conté
to
his
companion
phillipps
we
are
in
another
age
i
wish
i
had
some
snuff
to
offer
you
but
failing
that
i
beg
to
offer
you
a
seat
and
we
will
sit
and
smoke
tobacco
a
horrid
practice
but
i
am
no
pedant
they
sat
down
on
the
queer
old
chairs
and
looked
out
of
the
dim
and
grimy
panes
to
the
ruined
lawn
and
the
fallen
urns
and
the
deserted
triton
presently
dyson
ceased
his
imitation
of
eighteenth
century
airs
he
no
longer
pulled
forward
imaginary
ruffles
or
tapped
a
ghostly
it
a
foolish
fancy
he
said
at
last
but
i
keep
thinking
i
hear
a
noise
like
some
one
groaning
listen
no
i
ca
hear
it
now
there
it
is
again
did
you
notice
it
phillipps
no
i
ca
say
i
heard
anything
but
i
believe
that
old
places
like
this
are
like
shells
from
the
shore
ever
echoing
with
noises
the
old
beams
mouldering
piecemeal
yield
a
little
and
groan
and
such
a
house
as
this
i
can
fancy
all
resonant
at
night
with
voices
the
voices
of
matter
so
slowly
and
so
surely
transformed
into
other
shapes
the
voice
of
the
worm
that
gnaws
at
last
the
very
heart
of
the
oak
the
voice
of
stone
grinding
on
stone
and
the
voice
of
the
conquest
of
time
they
sat
still
in
the
old
armchairs
and
grew
graver
in
the
musty
ancient
air
the
air
of
a
hundred
years
ago
i
do
like
the
place
said
phillipps
after
a
long
pause
to
me
it
seems
as
if
there
were
a
sickly
unwholesome
smell
about
it
a
smell
of
something
burning
you
are
right
there
is
an
evil
odor
here
i
wonder
what
it
is
hark
did
you
hear
that
a
hollow
sound
a
noise
of
infinite
sadness
and
infinite
pain
broke
in
upon
the
silence
and
the
two
men
looked
fearfully
at
one
another
horror
and
the
sense
of
unknown
things
glimmering
in
their
eyes
come
said
dyson
we
must
see
into
this
and
they
went
into
the
hall
and
listened
in
the
silence
do
you
know
said
phillipps
it
seems
absurd
but
i
could
almost
fancy
that
the
smell
is
that
of
burning
flesh
they
went
up
the
stairs
and
the
the
odor
became
thick
and
noisome
stifling
the
breath
and
a
vapor
sickening
as
the
smell
of
the
chamber
of
death
choked
them
a
door
was
open
and
they
entered
the
large
upper
room
and
clung
hard
to
one
another
shuddering
at
the
sight
they
saw
a
naked
man
was
lying
on
the
floor
his
arms
and
legs
stretched
wide
apart
and
bound
to
pegs
that
had
been
hammered
into
the
boards
the
body
was
torn
and
mutilated
in
the
most
hideous
fashion
scarred
with
the
marks
of
irons
a
shameful
ruin
of
the
human
shape
but
upon
the
middle
of
the
body
a
fire
of
coals
was
smouldering
the
flesh
had
been
burned
through
the
man
was
dead
but
the
smoke
of
his
torment
mounted
still
a
black
vapor
the
young
man
with
spectacles
said
dyson
the
end
