the
adventures
of
bobby
coon
bobby
coon
has
a
bad
dream
some
dreams
are
good
and
some
are
bad
some
dreams
are
light
and
airy
some
dreams
i
think
are
woven
by
the
worst
bind
of
a
fairy
are
such
queer
things
so
very
real
when
all
the
time
they
are
unreal
that
sometimes
i
think
they
must
be
the
work
of
fairies
happy
dreams
the
work
of
good
fairies
and
bad
dreams
the
work
of
bad
fairies
i
guess
you
had
both
kinds
i
know
i
have
many
times
however
bobby
coon
says
that
fairies
have
nothing
to
do
with
dreams
bobby
ought
to
know
for
be
spends
most
of
the
winter
asleep
and
it
is
only
when
you
are
asleep
that
you
have
real
dreams
bobby
had
kept
awake
as
long
as
there
was
anything
to
eat
but
when
jack
frost
froze
everything
bard
and
rough
brother
north
wind
brought
the
that
covered
the
green
forest
with
snow
bobby
climbed
into
his
warm
bed
inside
the
big
hollow
chestnut
tree
which
he
called
his
curled
up
comfortably
and
went
to
sleep
he
did
care
a
hair
of
his
ringed
tail
how
cold
it
was
or
how
brother
north
wind
howled
and
shrieked
and
blustered
he
was
so
fat
that
it
made
him
wheeze
and
puff
whenever
he
tried
to
hurry
during
the
last
few
days
he
was
abroad
and
this
fat
helped
to
keep
him
warm
while
he
slept
and
also
kept
him
from
waking
from
hunger
illustration
bobby
did
sleep
right
straight
through
the
winter
as
does
johnny
chuck
once
in
a
great
while
he
would
wake
up
especially
if
the
weather
had
turned
rather
warm
he
would
yawn
a
few
times
and
then
crawl
up
to
his
doorway
and
peep
out
to
see
how
things
were
looking
outside
sometimes
he
would
climb
down
from
his
home
and
take
a
little
walk
for
exercise
but
he
never
went
far
and
soon
returned
for
another
long
nap
as
it
began
to
get
towards
the
end
of
winter
his
naps
were
shorter
he
was
no
longer
fat
in
fact
his
stomach
complained
a
great
deal
of
being
empty
perhaps
you
know
what
it
is
like
to
have
a
stomach
complain
that
way
it
is
very
disturbing
it
gave
bobby
no
peace
while
he
was
awake
and
when
he
was
asleep
it
gave
him
bad
dreams
bobby
knew
very
well
that
no
fairies
had
anything
to
do
with
those
dreams
they
came
from
a
bothersome
empty
complaining
stomach
and
nothing
else
one
day
bobby
had
the
worst
dream
of
all
he
had
prowled
around
a
little
the
night
before
but
had
found
nothing
wherewith
to
satisfy
his
bothersome
stomach
so
he
had
gone
back
to
bed
very
much
out
of
sorts
and
almost
as
soon
as
he
was
asleep
he
had
begun
to
dream
at
first
the
dreams
were
not
so
very
bad
though
bad
enough
they
were
mostly
of
delicious
things
to
eat
which
always
disappeared
just
as
he
was
about
to
taste
them
they
made
him
grunt
funny
little
grunts
and
snarl
funny
little
impatient
snarls
in
his
sleep
you
know
but
at
last
he
began
to
have
a
really
truly
bad
dream
it
was
one
of
the
worst
dreams
bobby
ever
had
had
he
dreamed
that
he
was
walking
through
the
green
forest
minding
his
own
affairs
when
he
met
a
great
giant
being
afraid
of
the
great
giant
he
ran
with
all
his
might
and
hid
in
a
hollow
log
no
sooner
was
he
inside
that
hollow
log
than
up
came
the
great
giant
and
began
to
beat
on
that
hollow
log
with
a
great
club
every
blow
made
a
terrible
noise
inside
that
hollow
log
it
was
like
being
inside
a
drum
with
some
one
beating
it
it
filled
ears
with
a
dreadful
roaring
it
made
his
head
ache
as
if
it
would
split
it
sent
cold
shivers
all
over
him
it
filled
him
with
dreadful
fear
and
despair
yes
indeed
it
was
a
bad
dream
a
very
very
bad
dream
ii
bobby
bites
his
own
tail
oh
tell
me
some
one
if
you
will
am
i
awake
or
dreaming
still
cried
bobby
coon
to
no
one
in
particular
because
no
one
was
there
to
hear
him
bobby
was
in
a
dreadful
state
of
mind
he
could
tell
for
the
life
of
him
whether
he
was
awake
or
asleep
and
dreaming
and
i
can
not
think
of
a
much
worse
state
of
mind
than
that
can
you
there
was
that
dreadful
dream
bobby
had
had
the
dream
of
the
dreadful
giant
who
had
chased
him
into
a
hollow
log
and
then
beat
on
that
log
with
a
great
club
frightening
bobby
almost
to
death
filling
his
ears
with
a
terrible
roaring
sound
that
made
his
head
ache
and
sending
cold
shivers
all
over
him
bobby
was
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
to
rush
out
of
that
hollow
log
in
spite
of
the
dreadful
giant
all
in
his
dream
you
know
when
suddenly
his
eyes
flew
open
and
there
he
was
safe
in
his
bed
in
the
hollow
chestnut
tree
which
he
called
his
own
bobby
gave
a
happy
little
sigh
of
relief
it
seemed
so
good
to
find
that
dreadful
experience
only
a
dream
phew
he
exclaimed
that
was
a
bad
bad
dream
and
then
right
on
top
of
that
he
gave
a
little
squeal
of
fear
there
was
that
awful
pounding
again
was
he
still
dreaming
was
he
awake
for
the
life
of
him
bobby
could
tell
there
was
that
same
dreadful
pounding
he
had
heard
in
the
hollow
log
but
he
was
in
the
hollow
log
he
was
safe
at
home
in
his
own
warm
bed
had
he
somehow
reached
home
without
knowing
it
in
the
strange
way
that
things
are
done
in
dreams
and
had
the
dreadful
giant
followed
him
that
must
be
it
it
must
be
that
he
was
still
dreaming
he
wished
that
he
would
wake
up
bobby
closed
his
eyes
as
tightly
as
he
knew
how
for
a
few
minutes
pound
pound
pound
sounded
the
dreadful
blows
then
he
opened
his
eyes
surely
this
was
his
hollow
tree
and
certainly
he
felt
very
much
awake
there
was
the
sunlight
peeping
in
at
his
doorway
high
overhead
yet
still
those
dreadful
blows
sounded
pound
pound
pound
his
head
ached
still
harder
than
ever
and
with
every
blow
he
jumped
and
a
cold
shiver
ran
over
him
from
the
roots
of
his
tail
to
the
tip
of
his
nose
never
in
all
his
life
had
bobby
known
such
a
feeling
is
this
i
or
is
it
i
he
whimpered
am
i
dreaming
and
think
i
awake
or
am
i
awake
and
still
dreaming
i
know
what
i
do
i
bite
my
tail
and
if
i
feel
it
i
know
that
i
must
be
so
bobby
took
the
tip
of
his
tail
in
his
mouth
and
bit
it
gently
then
he
wondered
if
he
really
did
feel
it
or
just
seemed
to
feel
it
so
he
bit
it
again
and
this
time
he
bit
harder
ouch
cried
bobby
that
hurt
i
must
be
awake
i
sure
i
awake
but
if
i
awake
what
dreadful
thing
is
happening
is
there
a
real
giant
outside
pounding
on
my
tree
then
bobby
noticed
something
else
with
every
blow
his
house
seemed
to
tremble
at
first
he
thought
he
imagined
it
but
when
he
put
his
hands
against
the
wall
he
felt
it
tremble
it
gave
him
a
horrid
sinking
feeling
inside
he
was
sure
now
that
he
was
awake
very
much
awake
he
was
sure
too
that
something
dreadful
was
happening
to
his
hollow
tree
and
he
could
imagine
what
it
could
be
and
what
is
more
he
was
afraid
to
climb
up
to
his
doorway
and
look
out
to
see
iii
bobby
dreadful
fright
poor
bobby
coon
now
he
was
sure
that
he
was
really
and
truly
awake
he
almost
wished
that
he
had
tried
to
find
out
it
would
have
been
some
little
comfort
to
have
been
able
to
keep
his
first
feeling
that
maybe
it
was
all
a
bad
dream
but
now
that
he
knew
positively
he
was
awake
he
knew
that
this
terrible
pounding
which
at
first
had
been
part
of
that
bad
dream
was
also
real
the
truth
is
he
could
no
longer
doubt
that
something
terrible
was
happening
to
his
house
the
big
hollow
he
had
lived
in
so
long
with
every
blow
and
the
blows
followed
each
other
so
fast
that
he
could
count
them
the
big
tree
trembled
and
bobby
trembled
with
it
what
could
it
mean
what
could
be
going
on
outside
he
wanted
to
climb
up
to
his
doorway
and
look
out
but
somehow
he
did
dare
to
he
was
afraid
of
what
he
might
see
yes
sir
bobby
coon
was
afraid
to
climb
up
to
his
doorway
and
look
out
for
fear
he
might
see
something
that
would
frighten
him
more
than
he
was
already
frightened
though
how
he
could
possibly
have
been
any
more
frightened
i
do
know
yet
all
the
time
it
did
seem
to
him
that
he
could
stay
where
he
was
another
minute
no
sir
it
did
he
was
too
frightened
to
go
and
too
frightened
to
stay
now
can
you
think
of
anything
worse
than
that
the
tree
trembled
more
and
more
and
by
and
by
it
began
to
do
more
than
tremble
with
a
dreadful
a
very
dreadful
sinking
of
his
heart
bobby
felt
his
house
begin
to
sway
that
is
move
a
little
from
side
to
side
a
new
fear
drove
everything
else
out
of
his
head
the
fear
that
his
house
might
be
going
to
fall
he
could
believe
that
this
could
be
true
yet
he
had
the
feeling
that
it
was
so
he
could
get
rid
of
it
he
had
lived
in
that
house
a
long
long
time
and
never
in
all
that
long
long
time
had
he
once
had
such
a
feeling
as
now
possessed
him
many
a
time
had
rough
brother
north
wind
used
all
his
strength
against
that
big
sometimes
he
had
made
it
tremble
ever
so
little
but
that
was
all
and
bobby
curled
up
in
his
snug
bed
had
laughed
at
rough
brother
north
wind
he
just
could
imagine
anything
really
happening
to
his
tree
but
something
happening
now
there
was
the
smallest
doubt
about
it
the
great
old
tree
shivered
and
shook
with
every
blow
at
last
bobby
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
just
to
know
what
was
happening
and
what
it
all
meant
with
his
teeth
chattering
with
fright
he
crawled
up
to
his
doorway
and
looked
down
badly
frightened
as
he
was
what
he
saw
frightened
him
still
more
it
frightened
him
so
that
he
let
go
his
hold
and
tumbled
down
to
his
bed
of
course
that
did
hurt
him
because
it
was
soft
and
in
a
minute
he
was
scrambling
up
to
his
doorway
again
what
shall
i
do
what
i
do
whimpered
bobby
coon
as
he
looked
down
with
frightened
eyes
i
ca
run
and
i
ca
stay
what
can
i
do
what
can
i
do
bobby
coon
was
horribly
frightened
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
he
was
horribly
frightened
have
you
guessed
what
it
was
that
he
saw
well
it
was
farmer
brown
and
farmer
brown
boy
chopping
down
the
big
which
had
been
bobby
home
for
so
long
and
looking
on
was
bowser
the
hound
iv
browser
finds
someone
at
home
that
bobby
coon
knew
what
it
was
that
had
frightened
him
so
he
felt
no
better
than
before
in
fact
he
felt
worse
before
he
had
imagined
all
sorts
of
dreadful
things
but
nothing
that
he
had
imagined
was
as
bad
as
what
he
now
knew
to
be
a
fact
his
house
the
big
hollow
in
which
he
had
lived
so
long
and
in
which
he
had
gone
to
sleep
so
happily
at
the
beginning
of
winter
was
being
cut
down
by
farmer
brown
boy
and
farmer
brown
himself
and
bowser
the
hound
was
looking
on
there
was
no
other
tree
near
enough
to
jump
to
the
only
way
out
was
down
right
where
those
keen
axes
were
at
work
and
where
bowser
sat
watching
what
chance
was
there
for
him
none
not
the
least
chance
in
the
world
at
least
that
is
the
way
bobby
felt
about
it
that
was
because
he
did
know
farmer
brown
and
farmer
brown
boy
you
see
all
this
time
that
bobby
coon
had
been
having
such
a
dreadful
such
a
very
dreadful
time
farmer
brown
and
farmer
brown
boy
and
bowser
the
hound
had
known
nothing
at
all
about
it
bobby
coon
once
entered
the
heads
of
any
of
them
none
of
them
knew
that
the
big
was
bobby
home
if
farmer
brown
boy
had
known
it
i
suspect
that
he
would
have
found
some
good
excuse
for
not
cutting
it
but
he
did
and
so
he
swung
his
axe
with
a
will
for
he
wanted
to
show
his
father
that
he
could
do
a
man
work
why
were
they
cutting
down
that
big
well
you
see
that
tree
was
practically
dead
so
farmer
brown
had
decided
that
it
could
be
of
use
in
no
way
now
save
as
wood
for
the
fires
at
home
if
it
were
cut
down
the
young
trees
springing
up
around
it
would
have
a
better
chance
to
grow
it
would
be
better
to
cut
it
now
than
to
allow
it
to
stand
growing
weaker
all
the
time
until
at
last
it
should
fall
in
some
great
storm
and
perhaps
break
down
some
of
the
young
trees
about
it
now
if
bobby
coon
had
known
farmer
brown
and
farmer
brown
boy
as
tommy
tit
the
chickadee
knew
them
and
as
happy
jack
squirrel
knew
them
and
as
some
others
knew
them
he
would
have
climbed
right
straight
down
that
tree
without
the
teeniest
weeniest
bit
of
fear
of
them
he
would
have
known
that
he
was
perfectly
safe
but
he
did
know
them
and
so
he
felt
both
helpless
and
hopeless
and
this
is
a
very
dreadful
feeling
indeed
for
a
little
while
he
peeped
out
of
his
doorway
watching
the
keen
axes
and
the
flying
yellow
chips
then
he
crept
miserably
back
to
bed
to
wait
for
the
worst
he
just
did
know
what
else
to
do
by
and
by
there
was
a
dreadful
crack
and
another
and
another
farmer
brown
shouted
so
did
farmer
brown
boy
bowser
the
hound
barked
excitedly
slowly
the
big
tree
began
to
lean
over
then
it
moved
faster
and
faster
and
bobby
coon
felt
giddy
and
sick
he
felt
very
sick
indeed
then
with
a
frightful
crash
the
tree
struck
the
ground
and
for
a
few
minutes
bobby
know
anything
at
all
no
sir
he
did
know
a
single
thing
you
see
when
the
tree
hit
the
ground
bobby
was
thrown
against
the
side
of
his
house
so
hard
that
all
the
wind
was
knocked
from
his
body
and
all
his
senses
were
knocked
from
his
head
when
after
a
little
they
returned
to
him
bobby
discovered
that
the
tree
had
fallen
in
such
a
way
that
the
hole
which
had
been
his
doorway
was
partly
closed
he
was
a
prisoner
in
his
own
house
he
did
mind
this
so
much
as
you
might
expect
he
began
to
hope
ever
so
little
he
began
to
hope
that
farmer
brown
and
his
boy
would
find
that
hollow
and
after
awhile
they
would
go
away
and
then
bowser
the
hound
upset
all
hope
he
came
over
to
the
fallen
tree
and
began
to
sniff
along
the
trunk
when
he
reached
the
partly
closed
hole
which
was
bobby
doorway
he
began
to
whine
and
bark
excitedly
he
would
stick
his
nose
in
as
far
as
he
could
sniff
then
lift
his
head
and
bark
after
that
he
would
scratch
frantically
at
the
hole
hello
exclaimed
farmer
brown
boy
bowser
has
found
some
one
at
home
i
wonder
who
it
can
bobby
coon
shows
fight
who
for
his
home
doth
bravely
fight
is
doing
what
he
knows
is
right
a
coward
he
the
world
would
say
should
he
turn
tail
and
run
away
coon
could
run
away
if
he
wanted
to
i
suspect
that
he
would
have
run
only
too
gladly
if
there
had
been
the
least
chance
to
but
there
he
was
a
prisoner
in
his
own
house
he
could
get
out
if
he
wanted
to
and
he
did
want
to
just
then
because
he
knew
by
the
sound
of
bowser
the
hound
deep
sniffs
at
his
doorway
followed
by
his
eager
barks
that
bowser
had
discovered
that
he
bobby
was
at
home
he
knew
that
bowser
could
get
in
and
so
he
was
very
well
content
to
stay
where
he
was
but
presently
bobby
heard
the
voice
of
fanner
brown
boy
and
though
bobby
did
understand
what
farmer
brown
boy
said
his
heart
sank
way
down
to
his
toes
just
the
same
at
least
that
is
the
way
it
felt
to
bobby
you
see
he
knew
by
the
sound
of
that
voice
even
though
he
could
understand
the
words
that
farmer
brown
boy
had
understood
bowser
and
now
knew
that
there
was
some
one
at
home
in
that
hollow
tree
as
to
that
bobby
was
quite
right
while
farmer
brown
boy
understand
what
bowser
was
saying
as
he
whined
and
yelped
he
did
understand
perfectly
what
bowser
meant
who
is
it
bowser
old
fellow
is
it
a
squirrel
or
whitefoot
the
wood
mouse
or
that
sly
old
scamp
unc
billy
possum
asked
farmer
boy
bow
wow
wow
replied
bowser
dancing
about
between
sniffs
at
doorway
i
do
know
what
that
means
but
i
going
to
find
out
bowser
laughed
farmer
brown
boy
picking
up
his
axe
bow
wow
bow
wow
wow
wow
replied
bowser
more
excited
than
ever
first
farmer
brown
boy
had
farmer
brown
bold
bowser
away
from
the
opening
then
with
his
axe
he
thumped
all
along
the
hollow
part
of
the
tree
hoping
that
this
would
frighten
whoever
was
inside
so
that
they
would
try
to
run
out
but
bobby
could
get
out
because
as
you
know
his
doorway
was
partly
closed
and
he
would
have
even
it
he
could
he
felt
safer
right
where
he
was
so
farmer
brown
boy
thumped
in
vain
when
he
found
that
this
was
useless
he
drove
the
keen
edge
of
his
axe
in
right
at
the
edge
of
the
hole
which
was
bobby
doorway
farmer
brown
joined
with
his
axe
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
slit
out
a
long
strip
which
reached
clear
to
where
bobby
was
crouching
and
let
the
light
pour
in
so
that
he
had
to
blink
and
for
a
minute
or
two
had
hard
work
to
see
at
all
right
away
bowser
discovered
him
and
growling
savagely
tried
to
get
at
him
but
the
opening
was
wide
enough
for
bowser
to
get
more
than
his
nose
in
and
this
bobby
promptly
seized
in
his
sharp
teeth
let
go
let
go
yelled
bowser
growled
bobby
and
tried
to
sink
his
teeth
deeper
bowser
yelled
and
howled
and
shook
his
head
and
pulled
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
so
that
at
last
bobby
had
to
let
go
farmer
brown
boy
hurried
up
to
look
in
what
he
saw
was
a
mouthful
of
sharp
teeth
snapping
at
him
bobby
coon
might
have
been
very
much
afraid
but
he
did
show
it
no
sir
he
did
show
it
what
he
did
show
was
that
he
meant
to
fight
for
his
life
liberty
and
home
he
was
very
fierce
looking
was
bobby
coon
as
farmer
brown
boy
peeped
in
at
him
vi
something
is
wrong
with
bobby
coon
brown
boy
chuckled
as
he
peered
in
at
bobby
coon
and
watched
bobby
show
his
teeth
and
listened
to
his
snarls
and
growls
it
was
very
plain
that
bobby
intended
to
fight
for
his
life
it
might
be
an
entirely
hopeless
fight
but
he
would
fight
just
the
same
bobby
said
farmer
brown
boy
you
certainly
are
a
plucky
little
rascal
i
know
just
what
you
think
you
think
that
my
father
and
i
cut
this
tree
down
just
to
get
you
and
you
think
that
we
and
bowser
the
hound
are
going
to
try
to
kill
you
you
are
all
wrong
bobby
all
wrong
if
we
had
known
that
this
tree
was
your
house
we
would
have
cut
it
down
no
sir
we
would
and
now
that
we
have
found
out
that
it
is
we
are
not
going
to
harm
so
much
as
a
hair
of
you
i
going
to
cut
this
opening
a
little
larger
so
that
you
can
get
out
easily
and
then
i
am
going
to
hold
on
to
bowser
and
give
you
a
chance
to
get
away
i
hope
you
know
of
some
other
hollow
tree
near
here
to
which
you
can
go
its
a
shame
bobby
that
we
did
know
about
this
it
certainly
is
and
ever
so
sorry
now
you
just
quit
your
snarling
and
growling
while
i
give
you
a
chance
to
get
but
bobby
continued
to
threaten
to
fight
whoever
came
near
you
see
he
could
understand
what
farmer
brown
boy
said
which
was
too
bad
because
it
would
have
lifted
a
great
load
from
his
mind
so
he
have
the
least
doubt
that
these
were
enemies
and
that
they
intended
to
kill
him
he
did
believe
he
had
the
least
chance
in
the
world
to
escape
but
he
bravely
intended
to
fight
the
very
best
he
could
just
the
same
and
this
shows
that
bobby
possessed
the
right
kind
of
a
spirit
it
shows
that
he
was
a
quitter
furthermore
though
no
one
knew
it
but
himself
bobby
had
been
badly
hurt
when
that
tree
fell
the
fact
is
one
of
bobby
legs
had
been
broken
yet
in
spite
of
this
he
meant
to
fight
yes
sir
in
spite
of
a
broken
leg
he
had
no
intention
of
giving
up
until
he
had
to
farmer
brown
boy
swung
his
axe
a
few
times
and
split
the
opening
in
the
hollow
tree
wider
so
that
bobby
would
have
no
trouble
in
getting
out
all
the
time
bobby
snapped
and
snarled
and
gritted
his
teeth
then
farmer
brown
boy
led
bowser
the
hound
off
to
one
side
and
held
him
farmer
brown
joined
them
and
then
they
waited
bobby
could
see
them
it
grew
very
still
there
in
the
green
forest
bobby
did
know
just
what
to
make
of
it
could
it
be
that
he
had
frightened
them
away
by
his
fierceness
after
awhile
he
began
to
think
that
this
was
so
he
waited
just
as
long
as
he
could
be
patient
and
then
poked
his
head
out
no
one
was
to
be
seen
for
farmer
brown
and
his
boy
and
bowser
the
hound
were
hidden
by
a
little
clump
of
slowly
and
painfully
bobby
climbed
out
that
broken
leg
hurt
dreadfully
it
was
one
of
his
front
legs
and
of
course
he
had
to
hold
that
paw
up
that
meant
that
he
had
to
walk
on
three
legs
this
was
bad
enough
but
when
he
started
to
climb
a
tree
he
could
with
a
broken
leg
there
would
be
no
more
climbing
for
bobby
coon
it
was
useless
for
him
to
look
for
another
hollow
tree
all
he
could
do
was
to
look
for
a
hollow
log
into
which
he
could
crawl
illustration
poor
bobby
coon
what
should
he
do
what
he
do
for
the
first
time
his
splendid
courage
deserted
him
you
see
he
thought
he
was
all
alone
there
and
that
no
one
saw
him
so
he
just
crouched
right
down
there
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
he
had
started
to
climb
and
whimpered
he
was
frightened
and
very
very
miserable
was
bobby
coon
and
he
was
in
great
pain
vii
bobby
has
a
strange
journey
its
funny
how
you
often
find
that
trouble
mostly
in
your
mind
a
fact
more
than
three
fourths
of
the
troubles
that
worry
people
are
not
real
troubles
at
all
they
are
all
in
the
mind
they
are
things
that
people
are
afraid
are
going
to
happen
and
worry
about
until
they
are
sure
they
will
happen
and
then
they
do
not
happen
at
all
very
very
often
things
that
seem
bad
turn
out
to
be
blessings
all
of
us
do
a
great
deal
of
worrying
for
nothing
i
know
i
do
bobby
coon
did
when
he
took
his
strange
journey
which
i
am
going
to
tell
you
about
farmer
brown
and
farmer
brown
boy
and
bowser
the
hound
had
watched
bobby
crawl
out
of
his
ruined
house
and
start
off
to
seek
a
new
home
of
course
they
had
seen
right
away
that
something
was
wrong
with
bobby
for
he
walked
on
three
legs
and
held
the
fourth
one
up
the
poor
little
chap
murmured
farmer
brown
boy
pityingly
that
leg
must
have
been
hurt
when
the
tree
fell
i
hope
it
is
badly
hurt
we
wait
a
few
minutes
and
see
what
he
so
they
waited
in
their
and
watched
bobby
they
saw
him
go
to
the
foot
of
a
tree
as
if
to
climb
it
they
saw
him
try
and
fail
because
he
could
climb
with
only
three
legs
and
they
saw
him
crouch
down
then
that
farmer
brown
boy
was
sure
that
bobby
hurt
was
really
serious
we
ca
let
that
little
fellow
go
to
suffer
and
perhaps
die
said
farmer
brown
boy
and
ran
forward
while
farmer
brown
held
bowser
bobby
heard
him
coming
and
promptly
faced
about
ready
to
fight
bravely
when
he
got
near
enough
farmer
brown
boy
threw
his
coat
over
bobby
and
then
in
spite
of
bobby
frantic
struggles
gathered
him
up
and
wrapped
the
coat
about
him
so
that
he
could
neither
bite
nor
scratch
bobby
was
quite
helpless
i
going
to
take
him
home
and
when
i
made
him
quite
comfortable
i
come
back
cried
farmer
brown
boy
all
right
replied
farmer
brown
with
a
kindly
twinkle
in
his
eyes
so
farmer
brown
boy
started
for
home
carrying
bobby
as
gently
as
he
could
of
course
bobby
could
see
where
he
was
being
taken
because
that
coat
was
over
his
head
and
of
course
he
had
understood
a
word
that
farmer
brown
boy
had
said
but
bobby
could
imagine
all
sorts
of
dreadful
things
and
he
did
he
was
sure
that
when
this
journey
ended
the
very
worst
that
could
happen
happen
he
was
quite
hopeless
was
bobby
coon
he
kept
still
because
he
had
to
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
all
the
time
he
wondered
where
he
was
being
taken
he
was
sure
that
never
again
would
he
see
the
green
forest
his
broken
leg
pained
him
dreadfully
but
fear
of
what
would
happen
when
this
strange
journey
ended
made
him
almost
forget
the
pain
it
was
the
first
time
in
all
his
life
that
bobby
ever
had
journeyed
anywhere
save
on
his
own
four
feet
and
quite
aside
from
his
fear
it
gave
him
a
very
queer
feeling
he
kept
wishing
it
would
end
quickly
yet
at
the
same
time
he
did
want
it
to
end
because
of
what
he
was
sure
would
happen
then
so
through
the
green
forest
then
through
the
old
orchard
and
finally
across
the
barnyard
to
the
barn
bobby
coon
was
carried
it
was
the
strangest
journey
he
ever
had
known
and
it
was
the
most
terrible
though
it
need
have
been
if
only
he
could
have
known
the
truth
viii
farmer
brown
boy
plays
doctor
no
greater
joy
can
one
attain
than
helping
ease
another
pain
bobby
coon
his
broken
leg
pained
him
a
great
deal
of
course
broken
legs
and
arms
always
do
pain
they
hurt
dreadfully
when
they
are
broken
they
hurt
dreadfully
after
they
are
broken
and
they
hurt
while
they
are
mending
among
the
little
people
of
the
green
forest
and
the
green
meadows
a
broken
leg
or
arm
is
a
great
deal
worse
than
it
is
with
us
humans
we
know
how
to
fix
the
break
so
that
mother
nature
may
mend
it
and
make
the
leg
or
arm
as
good
as
ever
but
with
the
little
people
of
the
green
forest
and
the
green
meadows
nothing
of
this
sort
is
possible
and
very
very
often
a
broken
limb
means
an
early
death
you
see
such
a
break
will
not
mend
properly
and
the
little
sufferer
becomes
a
cripple
and
cripples
can
not
long
escape
their
enemies
so
though
he
did
know
it
at
the
time
it
was
a
very
lucky
thing
for
bobby
coon
that
farmer
brown
boy
discovered
that
broken
leg
and
wrapped
him
up
in
his
coat
and
took
him
home
bobby
did
think
it
was
lucky
oh
my
no
bobby
thought
it
was
just
the
other
way
about
you
see
he
did
know
farmer
brown
boy
except
by
sight
he
did
know
of
his
gentleness
and
tender
heart
all
he
knew
of
men
and
boys
was
that
most
of
them
seemed
to
delight
in
hunting
him
in
frightening
him
and
trying
to
kill
him
so
all
through
that
strange
journey
in
the
arms
of
armer
brown
boy
up
to
farmer
brown
barn
bobby
was
sure
absolutely
sure
that
he
was
being
taken
somewhere
to
be
killed
he
did
have
a
doubt
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
when
they
reached
the
barn
farmer
brown
boy
put
bobby
down
very
gently
but
fastened
him
in
the
coat
so
that
he
could
get
out
then
he
went
to
the
house
and
presently
returned
with
some
neat
strips
of
clean
white
cloth
then
he
took
out
his
knife
and
made
very
smooth
two
thin
flat
sticks
when
these
suited
him
he
tied
bobby
hind
legs
together
so
that
he
could
kick
with
them
then
he
placed
bobby
on
his
side
on
a
board
and
with
a
broad
strip
of
cloth
bound
him
to
it
in
such
a
way
that
bobby
could
move
all
the
time
he
talked
to
bobby
in
the
gentlest
of
voices
and
did
his
best
not
to
hurt
him
but
bobby
could
understand
and
to
be
wholly
helpless
not
to
be
able
to
kick
or
scratch
or
bite
was
the
most
dreadful
feeling
he
ever
had
known
he
was
sure
that
something
worse
was
about
to
happen
you
see
he
did
know
anything
about
doctors
and
so
of
course
he
could
know
that
farmer
brown
boy
was
playing
doctor
very
very
gently
farmer
brown
boy
felt
of
the
broken
leg
he
brought
the
broken
parts
together
and
when
he
was
sure
that
they
just
fitted
he
bound
them
in
place
on
one
of
the
thin
smooth
flat
sticks
with
one
of
the
strips
of
clean
white
cloth
then
he
put
the
other
smooth
flat
stick
above
the
break
and
wound
the
whole
about
with
strips
of
cloth
so
tightly
that
there
was
no
chance
for
those
two
sticks
to
slip
that
was
so
that
the
two
parts
of
the
broken
bone
in
the
leg
would
be
held
just
where
they
belonged
until
they
could
grow
together
when
it
was
done
to
suit
him
he
covered
the
outside
with
something
very
very
bitter
and
bad
tasting
this
was
to
keep
bobby
from
trying
to
tear
off
the
cloth
with
his
teeth
you
see
he
knew
that
if
that
leg
was
to
become
as
good
as
ever
it
was
it
must
stay
just
as
he
had
bound
it
until
old
mother
nature
could
heal
it
so
farmer
brown
boy
played
doctor
and
a
very
gentle
and
kindly
doctor
he
was
for
his
heart
was
full
of
pity
for
poor
bobby
coon
ix
bobby
is
made
much
of
there
nothing
like
a
stomach
full
to
make
the
world
seem
brighter
to
banish
worry
drive
out
fear
and
make
the
heart
feel
lighter
farmer
brown
boy
was
playing
doctor
and
doing
his
best
to
fix
bobby
coon
broken
leg
so
that
it
would
heal
and
be
as
good
as
ever
poor
bobby
was
wholly
in
despair
and
nothing
is
more
dreadful
than
to
be
wholly
in
despair
there
he
was
perfectly
helpless
for
farmer
brown
boy
had
bound
him
so
that
he
could
move
you
see
bobby
could
understand
what
it
all
meant
if
he
could
have
understood
farmer
brown
boy
it
would
have
been
very
different
but
he
could
and
so
his
mind
was
all
the
time
full
of
dreadful
fear
when
farmer
brown
boy
had
bound
that
broken
leg
so
that
it
would
be
held
firmly
in
place
to
heal
he
made
a
comfortable
bed
in
a
deep
box
out
of
which
bobby
could
possibly
climb
with
that
broken
leg
in
this
he
put
bobby
very
gently
after
taking
off
the
bands
with
which
he
had
been
bound
to
the
board
while
the
broken
leg
was
being
fixed
then
he
went
to
the
house
and
presently
returned
with
more
good
things
to
eat
than
bobby
had
seen
since
cold
weather
began
these
he
put
in
the
box
with
bobby
and
then
left
him
alone
now
at
first
bobby
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
taste
so
much
as
a
crumb
he
would
starve
rather
than
live
a
prisoner
which
was
what
he
felt
himself
to
be
but
his
stomach
was
empty
the
smell
of
those
good
things
tickled
his
nose
and
in
spite
of
himself
he
began
to
nibble
the
first
thing
he
knew
he
had
filled
his
stomach
the
first
good
meal
he
had
had
for
many
weeks
because
you
know
he
had
been
asleep
most
of
the
winter
right
away
bobby
felt
sleepy
a
full
stomach
you
know
almost
always
makes
one
feel
sleepy
then
too
bobby
was
quite
tired
out
with
the
fright
and
strange
experience
he
had
been
through
so
he
curled
up
and
in
no
time
at
all
he
had
forgotten
all
his
troubles
and
for
days
and
days
bobby
slept
most
of
the
time
you
see
he
was
finishing
out
that
long
winter
sleep
he
was
used
to
and
this
it
happens
was
the
very
best
thing
in
the
world
for
bobby
being
asleep
he
was
tempted
to
try
to
pull
off
that
bandage
around
the
broken
leg
and
so
the
leg
had
just
the
chance
it
needed
to
mend
every
day
farmer
brown
boy
visited
bobby
just
as
a
good
doctor
should
visit
a
patient
and
looked
carefully
at
the
bandaged
leg
to
make
sure
that
it
was
as
it
should
be
and
whenever
farmer
brown
boy
visited
bobby
he
took
some
goody
in
his
pocket
to
tempt
bobby
appetite
just
as
if
it
needed
tempting
bobby
would
wake
up
long
enough
to
eat
what
had
been
brought
and
then
would
go
to
sleep
again
quite
as
if
he
were
all
alone
as
the
weather
grew
warmer
bobby
grew
more
wakeful
of
course
he
had
plenty
of
time
in
which
to
remember
and
to
think
he
remembered
how
dreadfully
frightened
he
had
been
when
farmer
brown
boy
had
caught
him
and
brought
him
to
the
barn
all
because
he
had
not
really
known
farmer
brown
boy
now
everything
was
different
so
very
very
different
it
was
a
fact
an
actual
fact
that
bobby
had
learned
to
know
the
step
of
farmer
brown
boy
and
when
he
heard
it
coming
his
way
he
was
as
tickled
as
once
he
would
have
been
frightened
you
see
farmer
boy
was
very
very
good
to
him
and
made
so
much
of
him
that
i
am
afraid
he
was
quite
spoiling
bobby
kindness
had
driven
out
fear
from
mind
and
in
its
place
had
come
trust
it
will
do
it
every
time
if
given
a
chance
bobby
longs
for
the
green
forest
though
bobby
coon
was
made
a
great
deal
of
by
farmer
brown
boy
and
was
petted
and
stuffed
with
good
things
to
eat
until
it
was
a
wonder
that
he
was
made
sick
he
was
really
a
prisoner
excepting
when
farmer
brown
boy
played
with
him
in
the
house
he
was
fastened
by
a
long
chain
you
see
when
at
last
the
bandage
was
taken
off
and
the
leg
was
found
to
have
healed
bobby
was
kept
a
prisoner
that
he
might
get
the
full
use
of
that
leg
once
more
before
having
to
shift
for
himself
day
by
day
the
strength
came
back
to
that
leg
until
it
was
as
good
as
ever
it
had
been
and
still
bobby
was
kept
a
prisoner
the
truth
is
farmer
brown
boy
had
grown
so
fond
of
bobby
that
he
could
bear
to
think
of
parting
with
him
at
first
bobby
had
minded
in
the
least
it
was
fine
to
have
all
the
good
things
to
eat
he
wanted
without
the
trouble
of
hunting
for
them
things
he
never
had
had
before
and
never
could
have
in
the
green
forest
it
was
fine
to
have
a
warm
comfortable
bed
and
not
a
thing
in
the
world
to
worry
about
so
for
a
time
bobby
was
quite
content
to
be
a
prisoner
he
did
mind
that
chain
at
all
excepting
when
he
wanted
to
poke
his
inquisitive
little
nose
into
something
he
could
reach
but
as
sweet
mistress
spring
awakened
those
who
had
slept
the
long
winter
away
the
trees
and
flowers
and
insects
and
old
toad
and
johnny
chuck
and
striped
chipmunk
and
all
the
rest
and
as
one
after
another
the
birds
arrived
from
the
sunny
southland
and
bobby
heard
them
singing
and
twittering
and
watched
them
flying
about
a
great
longing
for
the
green
forest
crept
into
his
heart
at
first
he
did
really
know
what
it
was
that
he
wanted
it
simply
made
him
uneasy
he
could
keep
still
he
walked
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
at
the
length
of
his
chain
he
began
to
lose
his
appetite
then
one
day
farmer
brown
boy
brought
him
a
fish
for
his
dinner
and
all
in
a
flash
bobby
knew
what
it
was
he
wanted
he
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
green
forest
he
wanted
to
fish
for
himself
in
the
laughing
brook
he
wanted
to
climb
trees
he
wanted
to
visit
his
old
neighbors
and
see
what
they
were
doing
he
wanted
to
hunt
for
bugs
under
old
logs
and
around
old
stumps
he
wanted
to
hunt
for
nests
being
built
so
that
later
he
might
steal
the
eggs
from
them
yes
he
did
just
this
i
am
sorry
to
say
bobby
is
very
fond
of
eggs
and
he
considers
that
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
them
if
he
is
smart
enough
to
find
them
he
wanted
to
be
free
to
do
what
he
pleased
when
he
pleased
and
how
he
pleased
he
wanted
to
go
back
home
to
the
green
forest
farmer
brown
boy
has
been
very
good
to
me
and
i
believe
he
would
let
me
go
if
only
i
could
tell
him
what
i
want
thought
bobby
but
i
make
him
understand
what
i
say
any
more
than
i
can
understand
what
he
says
what
a
great
pity
it
is
that
we
do
all
speak
the
same
language
then
we
would
all
understand
each
other
and
i
do
believe
we
little
folks
of
the
green
forest
and
the
green
meadows
would
be
hunted
so
much
by
these
men
creatures
there
nothing
like
common
speech
to
make
folks
understand
one
another
i
know
farmer
brown
boy
would
let
me
go
if
he
only
knew
i
he
bobby
sat
down
where
he
could
look
over
towards
the
green
forest
and
sighed
and
sighed
and
all
the
longing
of
his
heart
crept
into
his
eyes
xi
the
happiest
coon
ever
as
jolly
sun
smiles
down
and
makes
the
land
all
bright
and
fair
so
happiness
within
the
heart
spreads
joy
and
gladness
everywhere
though
bobby
coon
could
speak
the
language
of
farmer
boy
and
so
tell
him
how
he
longed
to
be
free
and
go
back
to
the
green
forest
he
could
and
he
did
tell
him
in
another
way
just
what
was
in
his
heart
he
told
him
with
his
eyes
though
he
did
know
it
you
know
eyes
are
sometimes
called
the
windows
of
the
soul
this
means
simply
that
as
you
look
out
through
your
eyes
and
see
all
that
is
going
on
about
you
so
others
may
sometimes
look
right
in
your
eyes
and
see
what
is
going
on
within
your
mind
eyes
are
very
wonderful
things
and
a
great
deal
may
be
learned
from
them
eyes
will
tell
the
truth
when
a
tongue
is
busy
telling
a
wrong
story
i
guess
you
know
how
hard
it
is
when
you
have
done
wrong
to
look
mother
straight
in
the
try
to
make
her
believe
that
you
have
done
wrong
that
is
because
your
eyes
are
truthful
looking
straight
into
the
eyes
of
fierce
wild
animals
often
will
fill
them
with
fear
trainers
of
lions
and
other
dangerous
animals
know
this
and
do
it
a
great
deal
fear
will
show
in
the
eyes
when
it
shows
nowhere
else
it
is
the
same
with
happiness
and
contentment
so
it
is
with
sorrow
and
worry
just
as
a
thermometer
shows
just
how
warm
it
is
or
how
cold
it
is
so
the
eyes
show
our
feelings
so
when
bobby
coon
sat
down
and
gazed
towards
the
green
forest
and
wished
that
he
could
tell
farmer
brown
boy
how
he
wanted
to
go
back
there
a
look
of
longing
grew
and
grew
in
bobby
eyes
and
farmer
brown
boy
saw
it
what
is
more
he
understood
it
his
own
eyes
grew
soft
you
poor
little
rascal
said
he
i
believe
you
think
you
are
a
prisoner
and
that
you
want
to
go
back
home
well
i
guess
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
now
i
very
fond
of
you
bobby
yes
i
am
i
so
fond
of
you
that
i
hate
to
have
you
go
and
i
guess
that
kept
you
longer
than
was
necessary
that
leg
of
yours
looks
to
me
to
be
as
good
as
ever
so
i
really
have
an
excuse
for
keeping
you
any
longer
i
think
we
take
a
walk
this
if
bobby
could
have
understood
what
farmer
brown
boy
was
saying
it
would
have
made
him
feel
a
great
deal
better
but
he
did
understand
and
so
he
continued
to
stare
towards
the
green
forest
and
grow
more
and
more
homesick
after
dinner
farmer
brown
boy
came
out
and
took
off
the
collar
and
chain
and
picked
bobby
up
in
his
arms
this
time
bobby
did
have
his
eyes
covered
as
he
did
when
he
had
been
brought
from
the
green
forest
fear
no
longer
made
him
want
to
bite
and
scratch
through
the
old
orchard
straight
to
the
green
forest
they
went
and
bobby
began
to
grow
excited
what
was
going
to
happen
what
did
it
mean
through
the
green
forest
straight
to
the
place
where
bobby
great
hollow
tree
used
to
stand
went
farmer
brown
boy
when
they
got
there
he
smoothed
bobby
coat
and
patted
him
gently
then
he
put
him
down
on
the
ground
here
we
are
bobby
said
he
now
run
along
and
find
a
new
house
and
be
happy
i
hope
you
wo
forget
me
because
i
am
going
to
come
over
often
to
see
you
just
keep
out
of
mischief
and
above
all
keep
out
of
the
way
of
hunters
next
fall
they
shall
not
hunt
here
if
i
can
help
it
but
you
know
i
can
not
watch
all
the
time
bobby
and
take
care
of
bobby
did
say
because
he
did
know
how
but
a
great
joy
came
into
his
eyes
and
farmer
brown
boy
saw
it
and
understood
straight
off
among
the
trees
bobby
walked
once
he
looked
back
farmer
brown
boy
was
watching
him
and
waved
a
hand
he
was
good
to
me
he
certainly
was
good
to
me
thought
bobby
i
i
believe
i
really
am
very
fond
of
then
he
went
on
to
look
for
a
new
house
all
the
joy
of
the
springtime
was
in
his
heart
he
was
free
he
was
home
once
more
in
the
green
forest
he
no
longer
feared
farmer
brown
boy
i
the
happiest
coon
in
all
the
world
cried
bobby
xii
bobby
tries
the
wrong
house
home
again
home
again
happy
am
i
had
i
but
wings
i
most
surely
would
fly
sang
bobby
coon
as
he
wandered
about
in
the
green
forest
after
leaving
farmer
brown
boy
at
least
he
meant
it
for
singing
of
course
it
was
real
singing
for
bobby
coon
can
no
more
sing
than
he
can
fly
but
it
did
very
well
to
express
his
happiness
and
that
was
all
it
was
intended
to
do
bobby
was
happy
he
was
very
happy
indeed
indeed
he
could
remember
ever
having
been
quite
so
happy
you
see
he
never
before
had
understood
fully
what
freedom
means
no
one
can
fully
understand
what
a
wonderful
and
blessed
thing
freedom
is
until
they
have
lost
it
and
then
got
it
again
bobby
took
long
breaths
and
sniffed
and
sniffed
and
sniffed
and
sniffed
the
sweet
smells
of
early
spring
the
green
forest
was
full
of
them
and
never
had
they
seemed
so
good
to
bobby
he
climbed
a
tree
for
nothing
under
the
sun
but
to
know
what
it
felt
like
to
climb
once
more
then
he
climbed
down
to
earth
again
and
went
poking
around
among
the
leaves
just
for
the
fun
of
poking
around
he
rolled
over
and
over
from
sheer
joy
finally
he
brushed
himself
off
climbed
up
on
an
old
stump
and
sat
down
to
think
things
over
of
course
said
he
to
himself
the
first
thing
for
me
to
do
is
to
find
a
new
house
i
do
have
to
have
it
right
away
because
there
are
plenty
of
places
in
which
i
can
curl
up
for
a
nap
but
it
is
more
convenient
and
much
more
respectable
to
have
a
house
people
who
sleep
anywhere
and
have
no
homes
are
never
thought
much
of
by
their
friends
and
neighbors
without
a
home
i
can
have
no
there
a
certain
old
hollow
tree
i
always
did
like
the
looks
of
unc
billy
possum
used
to
live
there
but
maybe
he
has
moved
anyway
he
may
be
out
and
if
so
he
will
be
smarter
than
i
think
he
is
to
get
me
out
once
i
inside
i
believe
i
look
up
that
tree
right
bobby
scrambled
down
from
the
stump
and
started
down
the
lone
little
path
after
a
while
he
turned
off
the
lone
little
path
into
a
hollow
and
presently
came
to
the
tree
he
had
in
mind
it
was
straight
tall
and
big
high
up
was
a
doorway
plenty
big
enough
for
bobby
coon
he
sat
down
and
looked
up
the
longer
he
looked
the
better
that
tree
seemed
to
him
it
would
suit
for
a
house
there
were
marks
on
the
tree
made
by
claws
the
claws
of
une
billy
possum
some
of
them
looked
quite
fresh
looks
as
if
une
billy
is
still
living
here
thought
bobby
well
i
ca
help
it
if
he
is
if
that
tree
looks
as
good
inside
as
it
does
outside
i
am
afraid
unc
billy
and
i
will
have
a
falling
out
every
one
for
himself
in
the
green
forest
and
i
do
think
unc
billy
will
care
to
fight
me
i
bigger
and
considerably
stronger
than
he
so
if
he
there
i
guess
i
just
invite
him
to
move
now
of
course
this
was
at
all
right
of
bobby
coon
but
it
is
the
way
things
are
done
in
the
green
forest
and
the
people
who
live
there
are
used
to
it
the
strong
take
what
they
want
if
they
can
get
it
and
bobby
knew
that
unc
billy
possum
would
treat
happy
jack
squirrel
the
same
way
if
he
happened
to
want
happy
jack
house
so
he
climbed
up
the
tree
quite
sure
that
this
was
the
house
he
would
take
for
his
new
home
he
was
up
when
a
sharp
voice
spoke
have
yo
made
a
mistake
brer
coon
said
the
voice
this
your
bobby
stopped
and
looked
up
unc
billy
possum
was
grinning
down
at
him
from
his
doorway
bobby
grinned
back
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
like
to
move
and
as
i
looking
for
a
house
i
think
this
one
will
suit
me
very
well
said
he
and
grinned
again
for
he
knew
that
unc
billy
would
understand
just
what
he
meant
illustration
before
unc
billy
could
say
a
word
another
sharp
face
appeared
beside
his
own
and
a
voice
still
sharper
than
his
said
what
that
no
coon
doing
in
our
tree
what
this
talk
ah
hear
about
moving
nobody
gwine
to
move
that
ah
knows
bobby
had
forgotten
all
about
old
possum
and
now
as
he
saw
that
it
was
two
against
one
he
suddenly
changed
his
mind
excuse
me
said
he
i
guess
i
got
the
wrong
xiii
bobby
makes
another
mistake
bobby
coon
left
unc
billy
possum
hollow
tree
he
went
fishing
you
know
he
is
very
fond
of
fishing
all
night
long
he
fished
and
played
along
the
laughing
brook
and
when
at
last
jolly
round
red
sun
began
his
daily
climb
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
bobby
was
wet
tired
and
sleepy
but
he
was
happy
it
did
seem
so
good
to
be
wandering
about
at
his
own
sweet
will
in
the
beautiful
green
forest
once
more
it
struck
him
now
as
rather
a
joke
that
he
had
any
house
to
go
to
it
was
a
long
long
time
since
he
had
been
without
a
home
i
got
to
sleep
somewhere
said
bobby
rubbing
his
eyes
and
yawning
and
the
sooner
i
find
a
place
the
better
i
so
sleepy
now
i
can
hardly
keep
my
eyes
open
hello
there
a
great
big
log
over
there
if
it
is
hollow
it
will
be
just
the
place
for
he
marched
straight
over
to
the
old
log
it
was
big
very
big
and
to
bobby
great
joy
it
was
hollow
with
an
opening
at
one
end
he
was
just
going
to
crawl
in
when
peter
rabbit
popped
out
from
behind
a
tree
hello
bobby
coon
cried
peter
joyously
where
have
you
been
i
was
over
where
you
used
to
live
and
found
your
house
gone
and
i
was
afraid
something
dreadful
had
happened
to
you
what
did
happen
and
where
have
you
been
now
tired
and
sleepy
as
he
was
bobby
had
to
stop
and
talk
for
a
few
minutes
you
see
peter
was
the
first
of
his
friends
bobby
had
met
to
whom
he
could
tell
all
the
wonderful
things
that
had
happened
to
him
and
he
was
fairly
aching
to
tell
some
one
so
he
sat
down
and
told
peter
how
his
hollow
tree
had
been
cut
down
and
how
his
leg
had
been
broken
and
how
farmer
brown
boy
had
taken
him
home
and
fixed
that
leg
so
that
old
mother
nature
could
make
it
as
well
and
sound
as
ever
and
how
farmer
brown
boy
had
brought
him
back
to
the
green
forest
and
set
him
free
and
how
he
had
been
fishing
all
night
and
now
was
looking
for
a
place
to
get
a
wink
or
two
of
sleep
now
if
you
excuse
me
peter
i
going
to
turn
in
for
a
nap
bobby
ended
and
started
to
crawl
in
the
end
of
the
hollow
log
oh
cried
peter
oh
you
must
go
in
there
bobby
but
bobby
did
hear
him
or
if
he
did
he
did
heed
he
kept
right
on
and
disappeared
a
funny
look
crept
over
peter
face
and
presently
he
began
to
chuckle
i
think
i
wait
awhile
and
see
what
happens
said
he
inside
that
big
hollow
log
bobby
found
it
very
dry
and
warm
and
comfortable
there
was
a
bed
of
dry
leaves
there
and
it
looked
very
inviting
now
ordinarily
bobby
would
have
examined
the
inside
of
that
log
very
thoroughly
before
going
to
sleep
but
he
was
so
tired
and
sleepy
that
he
did
half
look
around
he
did
go
to
the
farther
end
at
all
he
just
dropped
right
down
midway
curled
up
and
in
no
time
at
all
was
fast
asleep
it
was
a
mistake
a
very
great
mistake
as
bobby
was
shortly
to
find
out
meanwhile
outside
sat
peter
rabbit
although
it
was
already
past
time
for
him
to
be
home
in
the
dear
old
xiv
bobby
finds
out
his
mistake
if
friend
of
yours
a
mistake
makes
nor
yet
has
found
it
out
i
pray
that
when
at
last
he
does
you
will
not
be
about
is
bad
enough
to
find
out
for
yourself
that
you
have
made
a
mistake
but
to
have
other
people
know
it
makes
you
feel
a
great
deal
worse
so
the
kindest
thing
that
any
one
can
do
when
they
know
a
friend
has
made
a
mistake
and
it
is
too
late
to
warn
them
is
to
appear
not
to
know
of
it
at
all
so
it
was
nice
at
all
of
peter
rabbit
to
hang
around
watching
that
old
hollow
log
into
which
bobby
coon
had
crawled
for
a
nap
presently
peter
long
ears
caught
sounds
from
inside
that
hollow
log
first
there
was
a
rattling
and
rustling
then
came
a
series
of
grunts
and
squeaks
these
were
followed
by
growls
and
snarls
the
latter
were
from
bobby
coon
he
was
insisting
that
he
was
going
to
stay
right
where
he
was
and
would
move
an
inch
for
any
one
peter
clapped
one
hand
over
his
mouth
to
keep
from
laughing
aloud
when
he
heard
that
and
he
fastened
his
eyes
very
big
and
round
with
expectation
on
the
opening
in
the
end
of
the
hollow
log
you
see
peter
knew
all
about
that
log
and
who
lived
there
that
is
what
he
had
tried
to
tell
bobby
coon
he
could
hear
bobby
declaring
i
wo
move
a
step
not
a
single
step
you
can
stay
right
where
you
are
until
i
finish
my
nap
if
you
come
any
nearer
i
peter
did
hear
the
rest
if
indeed
bobby
finished
what
he
had
started
to
say
you
see
bobby
was
interrupted
by
a
great
rattling
and
rustling
and
a
grunt
that
sounded
both
angry
and
very
once
more
bobby
growled
and
snarled
and
declared
he
would
move
a
step
but
peter
noticed
that
bobby
voice
seemed
to
come
from
nearer
the
open
end
of
the
log
than
before
again
there
was
a
grunt
and
a
rattling
and
rustling
then
out
of
the
end
of
the
old
log
backed
bobby
coon
still
growling
and
snarling
and
declaring
he
would
move
a
step
it
was
too
funny
for
peter
to
hold
in
any
longer
he
had
to
laugh
he
could
help
it
then
the
black
nose
and
little
dull
eyes
of
prickly
porky
the
porcupine
appeared
in
each
of
those
little
dull
eyes
there
was
just
a
wee
spark
of
anger
which
made
them
less
dull
than
usual
it
was
plain
that
prickly
porky
was
provoked
ill
as
soon
as
he
was
outside
he
made
the
thousand
little
spears
which
he
carries
hidden
in
his
coat
stand
on
end
and
made
a
quick
little
rush
towards
bobby
coon
bobby
turned
tail
and
ran
the
sight
of
those
little
spears
was
too
much
for
him
he
was
afraid
of
them
everybody
is
afraid
of
them
even
big
buster
bear
it
was
these
little
spears
brushing
against
the
inside
of
the
old
log
that
had
made
the
rattling
and
rustling
peter
had
heard
the
impudence
of
that
coon
to
walk
into
my
house
and
go
to
sleep
without
so
much
as
asking
if
he
might
and
then
telling
me
that
i
come
out
until
he
says
so
the
impudence
of
him
grunted
prickly
porky
rattling
his
thousand
little
spears
as
for
bobby
coon
he
realized
now
the
great
mistake
he
had
made
in
not
first
finding
out
whether
any
one
was
at
home
in
that
old
log
before
trying
to
take
a
nap
there
it
mortified
him
to
think
he
had
been
so
careless
as
to
make
such
a
mistake
and
it
mortified
him
still
more
to
know
that
peter
rabbit
had
seen
all
that
had
happened
xv
once
more
bobby
tries
to
sleep
did
you
ever
have
the
sandman
fill
your
eyes
all
full
of
sand
and
then
have
to
keep
them
open
when
there
was
no
bed
at
hand
you
have
had
that
happen
then
you
know
exactly
how
bobby
coon
felt
when
he
was
obliged
to
crawl
out
of
prickly
porky
bed
and
go
hunt
for
another
he
was
so
very
very
sleepy
that
he
felt
almost
as
if
he
could
go
to
sleep
standing
right
on
his
feet
this
was
because
he
had
been
up
all
night
and
awake
most
of
the
day
before
now
he
wished
that
instead
of
spending
the
night
in
fishing
and
playing
about
the
laughing
brook
he
had
hunted
for
a
house
to
be
sleepy
and
not
able
to
sleep
makes
bobby
cross
just
as
it
does
most
folks
so
as
he
hurried
away
from
the
neighborhood
of
prickly
porky
and
his
thousand
little
spears
he
was
in
a
bad
temper
of
course
he
knew
it
was
his
own
fault
that
he
was
in
such
a
fix
and
this
make
him
feel
a
bit
better
in
fact
it
made
him
feel
worse
it
usually
is
that
way
so
he
grumbled
to
himself
as
he
went
along
he
did
know
where
he
was
going
he
was
too
cross
and
sleepy
and
upset
to
do
any
thinking
so
he
went
along
aimlessly
looking
for
a
place
where
he
might
sleep
undisturbed
at
last
he
came
to
a
tall
stump
a
great
big
old
stump
that
had
stood
in
the
green
forest
for
years
and
years
bobby
climbed
to
the
top
of
it
it
was
hollow
just
as
he
had
hoped
indeed
it
was
just
a
shell
looking
down
bobby
saw
with
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
that
the
bottom
was
covered
with
a
great
mass
of
rotted
wood
it
would
make
a
very
comfortable
bed
moreover
it
was
plain
that
no
one
else
was
using
it
bobby
sighed
with
satisfaction
it
was
just
the
place
for
a
good
long
nap
he
could
sleep
there
all
day
in
perfect
comfort
it
would
do
for
a
home
because
the
top
was
open
to
the
sky
and
on
a
rainy
day
the
inside
of
that
stump
would
soon
be
a
very
wet
place
indeed
but
for
a
nice
long
nap
on
a
pleasant
day
it
would
be
hard
to
beat
bobby
sighed
again
looked
all
about
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
watching
him
and
then
climbed
down
inside
i
guess
muttered
bobby
as
he
curled
up
on
the
bed
of
rotted
wood
which
is
sometimes
called
punk
that
at
last
i
shall
be
allowed
to
sleep
in
peace
i
never
was
more
sleepy
in
all
my
he
yawned
two
or
three
times
changed
his
position
for
greater
comfort
closed
his
eyes
and
in
a
twinkling
was
asleep
now
though
he
thought
no
one
saw
him
go
into
that
old
stump
some
one
did
that
some
one
was
peter
rabbit
peter
had
followed
bobby
just
out
of
curiosity
he
had
hidden
behind
trees
so
as
to
keep
out
of
sight
so
he
had
seen
bobby
climb
the
stump
and
disappear
inside
i
guess
said
peter
that
this
time
he
will
sleep
in
peace
no
one
is
likely
to
find
him
there
unless
it
should
be
that
sammy
jay
or
blacky
the
crow
happens
to
fly
over
and
so
discover
him
they
would
give
him
a
bit
of
peace
if
they
should
hello
there
blacky
voice
now
and
he
seems
to
be
coming
this
way
i
think
i
will
hang
around
a
while
xvi
blacky
the
crow
discovers
bobby
blacky
the
crow
is
sharp
of
eye
he
dearly
loves
to
peek
and
pry
i
must
confess
alas
alack
blacky
the
crow
an
imp
in
black
is
true
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
blacky
the
crow
never
is
happier
than
when
he
is
teasing
some
one
and
making
them
uncomfortable
he
is
an
imp
of
mischief
is
blacky
whatever
business
he
has
on
hand
he
goes
about
it
with
one
eye
open
for
a
chance
to
have
fun
at
the
expense
of
some
one
else
and
there
is
little
that
those
sharp
eyes
of
his
miss
he
sees
all
that
there
is
to
see
yes
sir
you
may
trust
blacky
for
that
it
was
just
the
hard
luck
of
bobby
coon
that
no
sooner
was
he
asleep
in
that
hollow
stump
in
the
green
forest
than
along
came
blacky
the
crow
flying
above
the
on
his
way
to
his
nest
but
as
usual
watching
sharply
for
what
might
be
going
on
below
it
just
happened
that
he
flew
right
over
that
stump
so
that
he
could
look
right
down
inside
he
saw
bobby
coon
curled
up
there
asleep
yes
indeed
you
may
be
sure
he
saw
bobby
blacky
checked
himself
in
his
flight
and
hovered
for
an
instant
right
above
that
stump
mischief
fairly
danced
in
his
sharp
eyes
then
he
turned
and
silently
flew
down
and
alighted
on
the
edge
of
the
old
stump
for
a
few
minutes
he
sat
there
looking
down
at
bobby
coon
all
the
time
he
was
chuckling
to
himself
then
he
flew
to
the
top
of
a
tree
and
began
to
call
with
all
his
might
caw
caw
caw
caw
caw
he
called
caw
caw
almost
right
away
he
was
answered
and
presently
from
all
directions
dame
hurrying
his
friends
and
relatives
each
one
cawing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
asking
blacky
what
he
had
found
blacky
did
tell
them
until
the
last
one
came
hurrying
up
then
he
told
them
to
go
look
in
the
old
hollow
stump
one
after
another
they
flew
over
it
looking
down
and
one
after
another
they
shouted
with
glee
then
as
many
as
could
find
a
place
on
the
edge
of
the
old
stump
did
so
while
the
others
sat
about
in
the
trees
or
flew
back
and
forth
overhead
and
all
of
them
began
to
caw
as
hard
as
ever
they
could
such
a
racket
as
they
made
of
course
bobby
coon
could
sleep
certainly
not
no
one
could
have
slept
through
that
racket
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
up
he
saw
a
ring
of
black
heads
looking
down
at
him
and
mischief
fairly
dancing
in
the
sharp
eyes
watching
him
the
instant
it
was
known
that
he
was
awake
the
noise
redoubled
caw
caw
caw
caw
caw
bobby
drew
back
his
lips
and
snarled
and
at
that
his
tormentors
fairly
shrieked
with
glee
then
blacky
dropped
a
little
stick
down
on
bobby
another
crow
did
the
same
thing
bobby
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
started
to
climb
up
his
tormentors
took
to
the
air
and
screamed
louder
than
ever
bobby
stopped
what
was
the
use
of
going
up
where
they
could
get
at
him
they
would
pull
his
fur
and
make
him
most
uncomfortable
and
he
knew
he
could
catch
one
of
them
to
save
him
he
backed
down
and
sat
glaring
up
at
them
and
telling
them
what
dreadful
things
he
would
do
to
them
if
ever
he
should
catch
one
of
them
this
delighted
blacky
and
his
friends
more
than
ever
they
certainly
were
having
great
fun
finally
bobby
did
the
wisest
thing
possible
he
once
more
curled
up
and
took
no
notice
at
all
of
the
black
imps
of
course
he
could
go
to
sleep
with
such
a
racket
going
on
but
he
pretended
to
sleep
now
you
know
there
is
no
fun
in
trying
to
tease
one
who
wo
show
he
is
teased
after
a
while
blacky
and
his
friends
got
tired
of
screaming
they
had
had
their
fun
and
one
by
one
they
flew
about
their
business
until
at
last
the
green
forest
was
as
still
as
still
could
be
bobby
sighed
thankfully
and
once
more
fell
asleep
xvi
blacky
the
crow
discovers
bobby
rabbit
should
have
been
back
home
in
the
dear
old
long
ago
he
knew
that
peter
was
worrying
she
always
worries
when
peter
overstays
but
peter
was
not
giving
much
thought
to
peter
in
fact
i
am
afraid
he
was
not
giving
any
thought
to
her
you
see
he
was
too
full
of
curiosity
about
bobby
coon
and
what
might
happen
to
him
he
had
been
sorry
for
bobby
in
a
way
yet
it
had
seemed
like
a
great
joke
that
any
one
as
sleepy
as
bobby
was
should
be
able
to
sleep
so
i
am
afraid
peter
rather
enjoyed
the
excitement
when
finally
blacky
and
his
friends
grew
tired
and
went
about
their
business
peter
began
to
think
of
getting
back
to
the
dear
old
i
guess
bobby
will
sleep
in
peace
now
thought
peter
i
ca
think
of
anything
more
that
possibly
can
happen
to
disturb
him
poor
bobby
he
has
had
a
hard
time
getting
that
still
peter
hung
around
he
did
know
just
why
but
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
might
miss
something
if
he
left
and
you
know
peter
never
could
forgive
himself
if
he
missed
anything
worth
seeing
so
he
hung
around
for
some
time
after
blacky
and
his
friends
had
gone
about
their
business
at
last
he
had
just
about
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
better
be
starting
for
home
when
he
was
startled
by
the
snapping
of
a
little
twig
peeping
out
from
behind
a
big
tree
peter
stared
towards
the
place
from
which
that
sound
had
come
in
a
moment
he
saw
a
big
black
form
buster
bear
gasped
peter
it
the
first
time
i
have
seen
him
this
spring
my
how
thin
he
is
peter
looked
about
to
make
sure
that
the
way
was
clear
for
a
hasty
run
if
it
should
be
necessary
and
then
held
his
breath
as
buster
drew
near
buster
kept
stopping
to
look
and
listen
and
sniff
the
air
and
suddenly
peter
understood
he
heard
those
noisy
crows
and
he
has
come
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
thought
peter
which
was
just
exactly
the
case
buster
knew
that
it
was
just
about
this
place
that
blacky
and
his
friends
had
been
making
such
a
racket
and
his
greedy
little
eyes
searched
everywhere
for
some
sign
of
what
had
been
going
on
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
a
black
feather
at
the
foot
of
a
tall
old
stump
by
this
buster
knew
for
sure
that
he
had
found
the
place
where
blacky
and
his
friends
had
been
but
there
was
nothing
to
tell
him
why
they
had
been
there
buster
sat
up
and
blinked
thoughtfully
then
as
he
looked
at
the
old
stump
his
eyes
brightened
i
do
know
what
all
that
fuss
was
about
he
muttered
and
i
guess
i
never
will
know
but
i
glad
i
came
just
the
same
that
old
stump
looks
to
me
to
be
rotten
and
hollow
i
have
found
ant
nests
in
many
an
old
stump
like
that
and
beetles
and
grubs
i
just
see
what
this
one
buster
walked
over
to
the
old
stump
hooked
his
great
claws
into
a
crack
and
pulled
with
all
his
might
peter
rabbit
watching
held
his
breath
with
excitement
there
was
a
sharp
cracking
sound
and
then
the
whole
side
of
that
old
stump
gave
way
so
suddenly
that
buster
bear
fell
over
backwards
as
he
did
so
bobby
coon
rolled
out
half
awake
and
frightened
almost
out
of
his
wits
it
was
hard
to
say
which
was
the
most
surprised
of
those
two
cousins
buster
bear
or
bobby
coon
xviii
buster
bear
short
temper
it
such
a
very
foolish
thing
so
silly
and
so
heedless
to
lose
your
temper
when
you
know
it
is
so
wholly
needless
buster
bear
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
saw
his
cousin
bobby
coon
scrambling
to
his
feet
buster
straightway
lost
his
temper
it
was
a
foolish
thing
to
do
a
very
foolish
thing
to
do
there
really
was
the
least
excuse
in
the
world
for
it
and
yet
buster
must
be
blamed
too
much
you
see
he
was
really
himself
ordinarily
buster
is
one
of
the
people
in
all
the
green
forest
he
does
begin
to
be
as
as
ever
so
many
others
are
in
fact
he
at
all
but
just
now
buster
was
hungry
he
was
so
hungry
that
he
could
think
of
anything
but
his
stomach
and
how
empty
it
was
you
see
so
early
in
the
spring
there
was
very
little
for
him
to
eat
and
he
had
to
hunt
and
hunt
to
find
that
little
when
he
had
started
to
tear
open
that
tall
old
stump
he
had
hoped
that
inside
he
would
find
either
a
nest
of
ants
or
some
of
the
worms
and
insects
that
like
to
bury
themselves
in
rotting
wood
so
when
bobby
coon
came
rolling
out
buster
was
so
disappointed
that
he
quite
lost
his
temper
before
he
had
time
to
think
he
flew
into
a
rage
you
see
he
just
took
it
for
granted
that
bobby
coon
had
been
in
that
hollow
stump
for
the
very
same
purpose
that
he
had
torn
it
open
now
it
never
does
to
take
things
for
granted
you
know
and
i
know
that
bobby
coon
had
crawled
into
that
stump
only
to
sleep
buster
did
know
this
and
buster
did
stop
to
find
it
out
he
growled
a
terribly
deep
growl
that
made
all
of
peter
rabbit
hair
stand
on
end
you
know
peter
was
close
by
hiding
behind
a
big
tree
to
see
all
that
might
happen
then
buster
bear
started
for
his
cousin
bobby
coon
and
his
little
eyes
seemed
to
fairly
snap
fire
i
teach
you
to
steal
an
honest
bear
dinner
he
growled
in
his
deep
grumbly
rumbly
voice
now
this
was
fair
to
bobby
for
bobby
had
stolen
no
dinner
even
if
he
had
been
hunting
for
food
in
that
hollow
stump
he
would
have
done
no
injustice
to
buster
bear
but
buster
did
stop
to
think
of
this
you
pay
for
it
by
furnishing
me
a
dinner
yourself
growled
buster
but
i
your
cousin
cried
bobby
as
he
started
to
run
that
does
make
a
bit
of
difference
snapped
buster
i
hungry
enough
to
eat
my
own
brother
if
i
had
all
the
time
buster
was
scrambling
after
bobby
coon
and
bobby
was
running
for
his
life
now
big
as
he
is
buster
can
move
very
fast
when
he
is
in
a
hurry
especially
when
he
is
thin
and
lean
bobby
coon
squealed
with
fright
and
scrambled
up
a
big
tree
faster
than
he
ever
had
scrambled
up
a
tree
before
in
all
his
life
buster
growled
a
deep
grumbly
rumbly
growl
and
started
up
after
him
oh
oh
cried
bobby
coon
and
you
may
be
sure
he
was
very
much
awake
by
this
time
there
was
no
thought
of
sleep
in
bobby
head
as
he
scrambled
nearly
to
the
top
of
that
big
tree
peter
rabbit
stared
in
horror
surely
buster
bear
would
catch
bobby
now
xix
bobby
coon
gets
a
terrible
shaking
me
alone
i
never
done
you
any
harm
so
leave
me
alone
whimpered
bobby
coon
as
he
climbed
the
tall
tree
with
buster
bear
scrambling
up
after
him
and
growling
all
the
way
for
a
minute
or
two
bobby
wished
he
had
stayed
on
the
ground
you
see
he
had
forgotten
that
buster
bear
could
climb
quite
as
well
as
he
could
now
he
was
in
the
tree
and
buster
was
below
him
and
it
looked
very
much
as
if
bobby
had
trapped
himself
suddenly
he
remembered
that
buster
could
go
out
on
little
branches
as
he
could
because
buster
was
too
big
and
heavy
bobby
looked
about
him
and
fear
made
his
eyes
quick
to
see
one
branch
reached
over
almost
to
the
top
of
a
slender
young
tree
growing
near
if
he
could
get
over
into
that
tree
perhaps
he
could
get
back
to
the
ground
and
run
for
his
life
anyway
it
was
worth
trying
out
along
the
branch
went
bobby
as
far
as
he
could
and
then
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
he
jumped
for
the
slender
young
tree
it
was
a
good
jump
and
he
caught
hold
of
a
branch
of
the
young
tree
then
he
turned
to
see
what
buster
bear
was
about
illustration
now
there
is
nothing
slow
about
buster
bear
wits
the
moment
he
saw
bobby
run
out
on
that
branch
he
knew
just
what
was
in
bobby
mind
huh
grunted
buster
to
himself
if
he
thinks
he
can
catch
me
napping
with
such
an
old
trick
as
that
he
will
have
to
think
he
waited
only
long
enough
to
make
sure
that
bobby
would
jump
for
the
other
tree
and
then
buster
went
down
faster
than
he
had
come
up
you
see
he
just
dropped
for
the
last
half
of
the
distance
so
by
the
time
bobby
coon
was
down
the
slender
tree
buster
bear
was
at
the
foot
of
it
waiting
for
him
poor
bobby
at
first
he
thought
he
was
no
better
off
than
before
there
was
no
other
tree
he
could
reach
from
this
one
now
all
buster
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
climb
up
and
get
him
bobby
was
about
ready
to
give
up
in
despair
but
buster
did
climb
up
he
did
even
try
he
just
stood
there
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
growled
every
growl
made
at
shiver
of
fright
run
all
over
bobby
why
did
buster
hurry
up
and
get
him
all
in
a
flash
it
came
to
bobby
why
buster
did
he
did
because
he
could
that
was
the
reason
he
could
climb
that
tree
because
it
was
too
for
him
to
climb
he
is
such
a
big
fellow
that
he
has
to
have
a
tree
to
get
his
arms
around
once
more
bobby
began
to
hope
but
buster
bear
is
one
to
give
up
easily
no
sir
buster
give
up
until
he
has
tried
all
the
things
he
can
think
of
now
he
stood
up
and
took
hold
of
that
tree
almost
as
if
he
were
going
to
try
to
climb
it
at
first
bobby
thought
he
was
but
in
a
minute
he
found
out
his
mistake
buster
began
to
shake
that
tree
my
my
my
how
he
did
shake
it
he
was
trying
to
shake
bobby
coon
down
the
very
first
shake
caught
bobby
by
surprise
and
he
very
nearly
lost
his
hold
then
he
saw
what
buster
was
up
to
and
he
held
on
for
dear
life
he
held
on
with
arms
and
legs
and
teeth
back
and
forth
swung
that
tree
and
bobby
with
it
it
was
worse
very
much
worse
than
the
hardest
wind
bobby
ever
had
been
out
in
but
he
grimly
held
on
with
claws
and
teeth
and
over
and
over
he
said
to
himself
i
wo
let
go
i
let
go
i
wo
let
and
he
did
xx
peter
rabbit
saves
bobby
coon
there
are
heroes
who
are
heroes
first
in
thought
and
then
in
fact
others
are
made
into
heroes
quite
by
accident
in
fact
heroes
are
those
who
do
brave
deeds
knowing
all
the
time
just
what
they
are
about
what
risks
they
are
taking
what
will
happen
if
they
fail
and
yet
do
the
brave
deeds
just
the
same
the
other
kind
of
heroes
are
not
real
true
heroes
at
all
but
are
treated
as
if
they
were
and
are
made
just
as
much
of
as
if
they
were
they
are
the
ones
who
do
what
seem
to
be
brave
deeds
but
which
in
truth
have
been
planned
at
all
and
have
been
done
unintentionally
people
who
in
trying
to
save
their
own
lives
happen
to
save
the
lives
of
others
always
are
called
heroes
and
are
much
looked
up
to
and
made
of
when
in
truth
they
are
not
heroes
at
all
peter
rabbit
is
this
kind
of
a
hero
he
saved
bobby
coon
life
at
least
bobby
coon
is
kind
enough
to
say
he
did
anyway
he
made
it
possible
for
bobby
to
escape
from
angry
buster
bear
so
peter
is
called
a
hero
and
has
been
made
much
of
everybody
says
that
he
was
very
very
brave
but
right
down
in
his
own
heart
peter
knows
that
he
deserve
any
of
the
nice
things
said
about
him
true
he
did
save
bobby
coon
but
he
did
do
it
purposely
no
sir
perhaps
he
might
have
if
he
had
thought
of
it
but
he
did
think
of
it
what
he
did
the
result
of
thinking
and
planning
at
all
but
of
not
thinking
of
carelessness
and
heedlessness
if
you
please
but
it
made
a
hero
of
peter
in
the
eyes
of
his
friends
and
neighbors
just
the
same
you
see
it
was
this
way
when
buster
bear
began
to
shake
that
slender
young
tree
trying
to
shake
bobby
coon
out
of
it
peter
forgot
everything
but
his
desire
to
see
what
would
happen
from
where
he
crouched
behind
that
big
tree
he
clearly
see
bobby
coon
in
the
top
of
the
slender
young
tree
so
quite
forgetting
that
he
might
be
in
danger
himself
peter
hopped
out
from
behind
that
big
tree
to
try
to
find
a
place
where
he
could
see
better
in
his
curiosity
and
excitement
he
heedlessly
forgot
to
watch
his
steps
and
trod
on
a
dry
stick
it
broke
with
a
little
snap
now
no
one
in
all
the
green
forest
has
keener
ears
than
buster
bear
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
his
attention
was
all
on
bobby
coon
he
heard
that
little
snap
and
whirled
like
a
flash
to
see
what
had
made
it
there
sat
peter
rabbit
staring
with
all
his
might
without
pausing
an
instant
buster
sprang
for
peter
he
would
make
very
good
eating
as
buster
well
knew
and
a
rabbit
on
the
ground
was
better
than
a
coon
he
could
shake
out
of
a
tree
peter
dodged
just
in
time
and
with
a
squeal
of
fear
away
he
went
twisting
dodging
running
with
all
his
might
and
after
him
crashed
buster
bear
how
peter
did
wish
that
he
been
so
curious
but
had
gone
home
to
the
dear
old
when
he
should
have
he
was
too
frightened
to
know
when
buster
bear
gave
up
the
chase
but
kept
right
on
running
as
a
matter
of
fact
buster
chase
him
far
he
knew
that
peter
was
too
nimble
for
him
to
catch
in
a
race
so
presently
he
gave
it
up
and
hurried
back
bobby
coon
was
nowhere
in
sight
he
had
taken
the
chance
to
climb
down
from
that
tree
and
run
away
by
leading
buster
off
for
just
those
few
minutes
peter
had
saved
bobby
coon
and
though
he
had
done
it
purposely
he
got
the
credit
just
the
same
he
became
a
hero
this
is
a
funny
old
world
is
it
xxi
bobby
finds
a
home
at
last
very
instant
buster
bear
started
after
peter
rabbit
down
from
that
tree
scrambled
bobby
coon
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
scrambled
down
a
tree
faster
he
knew
that
buster
would
not
follow
peter
far
and
so
he
bobby
had
no
time
to
lose
he
would
get
just
as
far
from
that
place
as
he
could
before
buster
should
return
so
while
peter
rabbit
was
running
in
one
direction
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
bobby
coon
was
running
in
the
opposite
direction
and
his
black
feet
were
moving
astonishingly
fast
he
did
know
where
he
was
going
but
he
was
on
his
way
somewhere
anywhere
to
get
out
of
the
neighborhood
of
buster
bear
so
bobby
took
little
heed
of
where
he
was
going
but
ran
until
he
was
too
tired
to
run
any
more
his
heart
was
beating
and
he
was
breathing
so
hard
that
every
breath
was
a
gasp
and
hurt
he
just
had
to
stop
he
could
run
another
step
after
awhile
bobby
heart
stopped
going
and
he
once
more
breathed
easily
he
knew
that
he
had
escaped
he
was
safe
he
sighed
and
that
sigh
was
a
happy
little
sigh
then
he
grinned
he
was
thinking
of
how
hard
he
had
tried
to
get
a
chance
to
sleep
that
day
and
how
every
time
he
thought
he
had
found
a
bed
he
had
been
turned
out
of
it
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
closed
his
eyes
bobby
has
a
sense
of
fun
and
now
he
saw
the
funny
side
of
all
his
experiences
there
is
one
thing
sure
and
that
is
being
without
a
home
is
a
more
serious
matter
than
i
thought
it
was
said
he
i
thought
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
find
a
place
to
sleep
when
i
wanted
to
but
i
begun
to
think
that
it
is
about
the
hardest
thing
i
ever
tried
to
do
here
i
am
in
a
strange
part
of
the
green
forest
and
homeless
there
no
use
in
going
back
where
i
used
to
live
so
i
may
as
well
look
around
here
and
see
what
i
can
find
perhaps
there
is
an
empty
house
somewhere
near
most
anything
will
do
for
so
bobby
began
to
look
about
for
an
empty
house
now
of
course
he
had
in
mind
a
hollow
tree
or
log
he
always
had
lived
in
a
hollow
tree
and
so
he
preferred
one
now
but
he
soon
found
that
hollow
trees
were
few
and
far
between
in
that
part
of
the
green
forest
and
those
he
did
find
did
have
hollows
big
enough
for
him
the
same
thing
was
true
of
hollow
logs
he
was
getting
discouraged
when
he
came
to
a
ledge
of
rock
which
was
the
foundation
of
a
little
hill
deep
in
the
green
forest
in
this
ledge
of
rock
bobby
discovered
a
crack
big
enough
for
him
to
squeeze
into
just
out
of
curiosity
he
did
squeeze
into
it
and
then
he
discovered
that
after
a
little
it
grew
wider
and
formed
the
snuggest
little
cave
he
ever
had
seen
it
was
very
dry
and
comfortable
in
there
all
in
a
flash
it
came
to
bobby
that
the
only
thing
needed
to
make
this
the
snuggest
kind
of
a
house
was
a
bed
of
dry
leaves
and
these
were
easy
to
get
bobby
eyes
danced
i
found
my
new
home
he
declared
out
loud
it
ca
be
cut
down
as
my
old
home
was
buster
bear
ca
tear
it
open
with
his
great
claws
no
one
bigger
than
i
can
get
into
it
it
the
safest
and
best
house
in
all
the
green
forest
and
i
going
to
stay
right
right
then
and
there
bobby
coon
curled
up
for
that
sleep
he
so
much
needed
xxii
bobby
finds
he
has
a
neighbor
his
new
home
in
the
little
cave
in
the
ledge
of
rocks
deep
in
the
green
forest
bobby
coon
at
last
slept
peacefully
there
was
no
one
to
disturb
him
and
so
he
made
up
for
all
the
time
he
had
lost
he
slept
all
the
rest
of
that
day
and
when
he
awoke
jolly
round
red
sun
had
gone
to
bed
behind
the
purple
hills
and
mistress
moon
had
taken
his
place
in
the
sky
at
first
bobby
could
think
where
he
was
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
stared
hard
at
the
stone
walls
of
his
bedroom
and
wondered
where
he
was
and
how
he
came
to
be
there
then
little
by
little
he
remembered
all
that
had
happened
how
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
thinking
he
could
take
unc
billy
possum
home
away
from
him
how
he
had
heedlessly
crept
into
prickly
porky
house
for
a
nap
only
to
be
driven
out
by
prickly
porky
himself
how
he
had
found
a
splendid
hollow
stump
but
had
been
discovered
there
by
blacky
the
crow
and
afterward
by
buster
bear
how
buster
bear
had
chased
him
and
given
him
a
terrible
shaking
in
the
top
of
a
slender
young
tree
how
buster
had
stopped
to
chase
peter
rabbit
how
he
bobby
had
taken
this
chance
to
run
until
he
could
run
no
more
and
found
himself
in
a
strange
part
of
the
green
forest
how
he
had
looked
in
vain
for
a
hollow
tree
in
which
to
make
a
new
home
and
lastly
how
he
had
found
this
little
cave
in
the
ledge
of
rock
little
by
little
all
this
came
back
to
bobby
as
he
lay
stretching
and
yawning
at
last
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
began
to
examine
his
new
house
more
carefully
than
he
had
when
he
first
entered
the
more
he
studied
it
the
better
he
liked
it
having
no
one
else
to
talk
to
he
talked
to
himself
the
first
and
most
important
thing
to
look
for
in
a
house
is
safety
said
he
i
used
to
think
a
good
stout
hollow
tree
was
the
safest
place
in
the
world
but
i
was
mistaken
men
can
cut
hollow
trees
down
that
is
what
happened
to
my
old
house
but
it
ca
happen
here
no
sir
it
ca
possibly
happen
here
neither
can
buster
bear
tear
it
open
with
his
great
claws
and
the
entrance
is
so
narrow
that
no
one
of
whom
i
need
be
afraid
can
possibly
get
in
here
this
is
the
safest
place
ever
seen
the
next
most
important
thing
is
dryness
a
damp
house
is
bad
very
bad
it
is
uncomfortable
and
it
is
bad
for
the
health
this
place
is
perfectly
dry
it
will
be
warm
in
winter
and
cool
in
summer
i
imagine
a
more
comfortable
house
the
only
thing
lacking
is
a
good
bed
and
that
i
soon
make
on
the
whole
i
guess
the
finding
of
this
new
house
is
worth
all
i
went
through
now
i
think
i
go
out
and
get
acquainted
with
the
neighborhood
and
see
if
i
have
got
any
near
so
bobby
went
out
through
the
narrow
entrance
and
began
to
look
about
to
see
what
he
could
discover
i
think
said
he
that
i
follow
this
ledge
and
see
if
there
are
any
more
caves
like
mine
i
might
find
a
better
one
though
i
doubt
he
shuffled
along
light
of
heart
and
brimming
over
with
excitement
and
curiosity
you
know
it
always
is
great
fun
to
explore
a
strange
place
he
had
gone
but
a
little
way
when
he
came
to
a
sort
of
big
open
cave
in
the
rock
bobby
stopped
and
peered
in
almost
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
a
bed
it
was
a
big
bed
and
it
was
made
of
dry
leaves
and
little
branches
of
hemlock
it
was
a
very
good
bed
and
it
was
clear
that
some
one
had
been
sleeping
in
it
very
recently
bobby
eyes
grew
very
round
then
he
sniffed
that
one
sniff
was
enough
bobby
turned
and
ran
back
to
his
new
house
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
take
him
all
the
pleasure
he
had
taken
in
his
new
home
was
gone
he
had
discovered
that
his
nearest
neighbor
was
none
other
than
buster
bear
himself
xxiii
buster
bear
finds
bobby
coon
coon
was
back
in
his
new
house
in
the
little
cave
in
the
rocky
ledge
deep
in
the
green
forest
and
never
was
he
or
any
member
of
his
family
more
upset
you
see
he
had
started
out
in
high
spirits
to
see
what
was
to
be
seen
about
his
new
home
and
to
find
out
who
his
neighbors
might
be
and
he
had
much
more
than
started
when
he
discovered
that
his
nearest
neighbor
was
none
other
than
buster
bear
was
that
enough
to
upset
anybody
anyway
it
was
enough
to
upset
bobby
coon
for
only
a
few
hours
before
buster
bear
had
tried
to
catch
him
and
had
threatened
to
eat
him
so
all
desire
to
spend
the
night
looking
about
left
bobby
the
very
instant
he
found
buster
bear
home
in
that
very
same
rocky
ledge
in
which
his
own
new
home
was
what
a
dreadful
fix
what
a
dreadful
dreadful
fix
i
in
whined
bobby
here
i
found
the
best
home
i
ever
had
and
now
i
find
that
buster
bear
lives
almost
next
door
i
do
dare
stay
here
and
i
have
any
place
to
go
oh
dear
oh
dear
what
can
a
poor
little
fellow
like
me
do
i
wish
i
were
as
big
as
buster
bear
i
do
then
fight
him
i
would
i
fight
who
would
you
fight
demanded
a
great
deep
grumbly
rumbly
voice
from
outside
his
doorway
bobby
just
dropped
right
down
where
he
was
and
shook
with
fright
but
he
took
great
care
not
to
make
a
sound
not
the
teeniest
weeniest
sound
perhaps
buster
bear
did
know
who
it
was
he
had
overheard
perhaps
if
he
kept
perfectly
still
buster
would
think
he
had
been
mistaken
who
are
you
in
there
anyway
demanded
the
deep
grumbly
rumbly
voice
i
did
know
any
one
was
living
here
why
do
you
come
out
and
be
sociable
bobby
simply
shivered
and
kept
his
tongue
still
for
a
minute
or
two
there
was
no
sound
from
outside
then
there
were
three
long
sniffs
sniff
sniff
sniff
they
made
bobby
shiver
more
than
ever
oh
ho
so
it
you
bobby
coon
it
my
little
cousin
bobby
exclaimed
the
deep
grumbly
rumbly
voice
of
buster
bear
followed
by
a
chuckle
welcome
to
the
old
rock
ledge
bobby
welcome
to
the
old
rock
ledge
if
i
am
to
have
such
a
near
neighbor
i
glad
it
is
to
be
you
come
out
and
shake
hands
do
be
so
bashful
i
wo
hurt
at
that
bobby
pricked
up
his
ears
a
little
he
knew
that
buster
nose
had
told
him
all
he
wanted
to
know
and
that
there
was
no
use
to
pretend
any
longer
do
you
really
mean
that
cousin
buster
he
asked
in
a
faint
voice
certainly
i
mean
it
of
course
why
not
i
usually
mean
what
i
say
grumbled
buster
bear
that
just
the
trouble
replied
bobby
timidly
just
a
little
while
ago
you
tried
to
catch
me
and
said
that
you
would
eat
me
and
i
thought
you
meant
buster
bear
began
to
chuckle
and
then
to
laugh
and
his
laugh
was
deep
and
grumbly
rumbly
like
his
voice
that
so
bobby
that
so
said
he
but
that
was
when
my
stomach
was
so
empty
that
it
made
me
lose
my
temper
now
my
stomach
is
full
and
i
really
myself
you
know
you
do
need
to
be
afraid
of
me
when
i
am
myself
just
forget
that
little
affair
i
should
have
if
you
had
reminded
me
of
it
i
glad
you
decided
to
be
neighborly
you
could
make
your
home
in
a
safer
place
i
going
to
take
a
nap
now
come
over
and
see
me
when
you
feel
like
it
be
neighborly
cousin
bobby
be
with
this
buster
bear
went
shuffling
along
to
his
own
house
and
bed
as
for
bobby
coon
he
was
soon
in
the
best
of
spirits
again
he
decided
to
remain
right
there
and
he
is
there
this
very
minute
i
suspect
unless
he
is
out
getting
into
mischief
or
seeking
new
adventures
speaking
of
adventures
reminds
me
of
some
of
jimmy
skunk
it
will
take
a
whole
book
to
tell
you
of
them
so
i
am
going
to
devote
the
next
one
to
jimmy
and
his
doings
the
end
