preface
in
this
sad
hour
of
the
world
history
when
so
many
homes
have
been
broken
up
and
so
many
hearts
burdened
with
heavy
sorrows
it
is
comforting
to
think
of
the
many
heroic
souls
who
throughout
the
struggle
have
gone
about
their
daily
tasks
with
unfailing
courage
and
cheerfulness
and
by
so
doing
have
helped
to
carry
the
burdens
of
the
world
and
to
sustain
other
hearts
as
heavy
as
their
own
it
is
comforting
also
to
know
that
there
are
many
instances
of
happy
reunions
after
long
and
unspeakable
anxieties
adventures
and
trials
this
story
of
two
little
belgian
refugees
is
based
upon
the
actual
experience
of
two
belgian
children
and
the
incident
of
the
locket
is
quite
true
the
characters
of
the
and
the
mother
of
the
twins
have
also
their
living
originals
from
whose
courage
and
devotion
the

the
most
wonderful
part
the
belgian
twins
i
the
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
of
a
long
summer
day
in
belgium
father
van
hove
was
still
at
work
in
the
though
the
sun
hung
so
low
in
the
west
that
his
shadow
stretching
far
across
the
level
green
plain
reached
almost
to
the
little
house
on
the
edge
of
the
village
which
was
its
home
another
shadow
not
so
long
and
quite
a
little
broader
stretched
itself
beside
his
for
mother
van
hove
was
also
in
the
field
helping
her
husband
to
load
the
golden
sheaves
upon
an
old
blue
which
stood
near
by
them
were
also
two
short
fat
shadows
which
bobbed
briskly
about
over
the
green
meadow
as
their
owners
danced
among
the
or
carried
handfuls
of
fresh
grass
to
pier
the
patient
white
hitched
to
the
cart
these
gay
shadows
belonged
to
jan
and
marie
sometimes
called
by
their
parents
janke
and
mie
for
short
jan
and
marie
were
the
twin
son
and
daughter
of
father
and
mother
van
hove
and
though
they
were
but
eight
years
old
they
were
already
quite
used
to
helping
their
father
and
mother
with
the
work
of
their
little
farm
they
knew
how
to
feed
the
chickens
and
hunt
the
eggs
and
lead
pier
to
water
and
pull
weeds
in
the
garden
in
the
spring
they
had
even
helped
sow
the
wheat
and
barley
and
now
in
the
late
summer
they
were
helping
to
harvest
the
grain
the
children
had
been
in
the
field
since
sunrise
but
not
all
of
the
long
bright
day
had
been
given
to
labor
early
in
the
morning
their
father
pitchfork
had
uncovered
a
nest
of
field
mice
and
the
twins
had
made
another
nest
as
much
like
the
first
as
possible
to
put
the
homeless
field
babies
in
hoping
that
their
mother
would
find
them
again
and
resume
her
interrupted
housekeeping
then
they
had
played
for
a
long
time
in
the
tiny
canal
which
separated
the
from
the
meadow
where
bel
their
black
and
white
cow
was
pastured
there
was
also
fidel
the
dog
their
faithful
companion
and
friend
the
children
had
followed
him
on
many
an
excursion
among
the
willows
along
the
for
fidel
might
at
any
moment
come
upon
the
rabbit
or
water
rat
which
he
was
always
seeking
and
what
a
pity
it
would
be
for
jan
and
marie
to
miss
a
sight
like
that
when
the
sun
was
high
overhead
the
whole
family
and
fidel
also
had
rested
under
a
tree
by
the
little
river
and
jan
and
marie
had
shared
with
their
father
and
mother
the
bread
and
cheese
which
had
been
brought
from
home
for
their
noon
meal
then
they
had
taken
a
nap
in
the
shade
for
it
is
a
long
day
that
begins
and
ends
with
the
midsummer
sun
the
bees
hummed
so
drowsily
in
the
clover
that
mother
van
hove
also
took
forty
winks
while
father
van
hove
led
pier
to
the
river
for
a
drink
and
tied
him
where
he
could
enjoy
the
rich
meadow
grass
for
a
while
and
now
the
long
day
was
nearly
over
the
last
level
rays
of
the
disappearing
sun
glistened
on
the
red
roofs
of
the
village
and
the
windows
of
the
little
houses
gave
back
an
answering
flash
of
light
on
the
steeple
of
the
tiny
church
the
gilded
cross
shone
like
fire
against
the
gray
of
the
eastern
sky
the
village
clock
struck
seven
and
was
answered
faintly
by
the
sound
of
distant
chimes
from
the
cathedral
of
malines
miles
away
across
the
plain
for
some
time
father
van
hove
had
been
standing
on
top
of
the
load
catching
the
sheaves
which
mother
van
hove
tossed
up
to
him
and
stowing
them
away
in
the
which
was
already
heaped
high
with
the
golden
grain
as
the
clock
struck
he
paused
in
his
labor
took
off
his
hat
and
wiped
his
brow
he
listened
for
a
moment
to
the
music
of
the
bells
glanced
at
the
western
sky
already
rosy
with
promise
of
the
sunset
and
at
the
above
the
cross
on
the
then
he
looked
down
at
the
sheaves
of
wheat
still
standing
like
tiny
tents
across
the
field
it
no
use
mother
he
said
at
last
we
can
not
put
it
all
in
but
the
sky
gives
promise
of
a
fair
day
and
the
also
points
east
we
can
finish
in
one
more
load
let
us
go
home
now
the
clock
struck
seven
cried
i
counted
the
strokes
what
a
scholar
is
our
janke
laughed
his
mother
as
she
lifted
the
last
sheaf
of
wheat
on
her
fork
and
tossed
it
at
father
van
feet
he
can
count
seven
when
it
is
as
for
me
i
do
not
need
a
clock
i
can
tell
the
time
of
day
by
the
ache
in
my
bones
and
besides
that
there
is
bel
at
the
pasture
bars
waiting
to
be
milked
and
bellowing
to
call
me
i
do
need
a
clock
either
chimed
in
marie
patting
her
apron
tenderly
i
can
tell
time
by
my
stomach
it
a
hundred
years
since
we
ate
our
lunch
i
know
it
is
come
then
my
starvelings
said
mother
van
hove
pinching
fat
cheek
and
you
shall
save
your
strength
by
riding
home
on
the
load
here
ma
mie
up
you
go
she
swung
marie
into
the
air
as
she
spoke
father
van
hove
reached
down
from
his
perch
on
top
of
the
load
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
enthroned
her
upon
the
fragrant
grain
and
now
it
is
your
turn
my
janke
cried
mother
van
hove
and
you
shall
ride
on
the
back
of
old
pier
like
a
soldier
going
to
the
wars
she
lifted
jan
to
the
horse
back
while
father
van
hove
climbed
down
to
earth
once
more
and
took
up
the
reins
fidel
came
back
dripping
wet
from
the
river
shook
himself
and
fell
in
behind
the
wagon
u
u
cried
father
van
hove
to
old
pier
and
the
little
procession
moved
slowly
up
the
toward
the
shining
windows
of
their
house
the
home
of
the
van
hoves
lay
on
the
very
outskirts
of
the
little
hamlet
of
meer
beside
it
ran
a
yellow
ribbon
of
road
which
stretched
across
the
green
plain
clear
to
the
city
of
malines
as
they
turned
from
the
into
the
road
the
old
blue
cart
became
part
of
a
little
profession
of
similar
wagons
for
the
other
men
of
meer
were
also
late
in
coming
home
to
the
village
from
their
outlying
farms
neighbor
cried
father
van
hove
to
father
maes
whose
home
lay
beyond
his
in
the
village
how
are
your
crops
coming
on
never
better
answered
father
maes
i
have
more
wheat
to
the
acre
than
ever
before
so
have
i
thanks
be
to
the
good
god
answered
father
van
hove
the
winter
will
find
our
barns
full
this
year
yes
replied
father
maes
a
little
sadly
that
is
if
we
have
no
bad
luck
but
jules
verhulst
was
in
the
city
yesterday
and
heard
rumors
of
a
german
army
on
our
borders
it
is
very
likely
only
an
idle
tale
to
frighten
the
women
and
children
but
jules
says
there
are
men
also
who
believe
it
i
shall
believe
nothing
of
the
sort
said
father
van
hove
stoutly
are
we
not
safe
under
the
protection
of
our
treaty
no
no
neighbor
there
nothing
to
fear
belgium
is
neutral
ground
i
hope
you
may
be
right
answered
father
maes
cracking
his
whip
and
the
cart
moved
on
mother
van
hove
meanwhile
had
hastened
ahead
of
the
cart
to
stir
up
the
kitchen
fire
and
put
the
kettle
on
before
the
others
should
reach
home
and
when
father
van
hove
at
last
drove
into
the
farmyard
she
was
already
on
the
way
to
the
pasture
bars
with
her
on
her
arm
set
the
table
for
supper
ma
mie
she
called
back
and
do
not
let
the
pot
boil
over
jan
you
may
shut
up
the
fowls

have
already
gone
to
roost
and
what

i
do
mother
laughed
father
van
hove
you
she
called
back
you
may
unharness
pier
and
turn
him
out
in
the
pasture
for
the
night
and
i
wager
i
shall
be
back
with
a
full
before
you
even
so
much
as
fed
the
pig
let
alone
the
other
chores
men
are
so
slow
she
waved
her
hand
gayly
and
disappeared
behind
the
pasture
bars
as
she
spoke
hurry
now
my
man
said
father
van
hove
to
we
must
not
let
mother
beat
us
we
will
let
the
cart

right
there
near
the
barn
and
we
can
store
the
grain
away
to
make
room
for
a
new
load
i
will
let
you
lead
pier
to
the
pasture
while
i
feed
the
pig
myself
by
her
squeals
she
is
hungry
enough
to
eat
you
up
in
one
mouthful
ii
the
rumors
when
mother
van
hove
returned
from
the
pasture
fifteen
minutes
later
her
orders
had
all
been
carried
out
pier
was
in
the
pasture
the
hens
were
shut
up
for
the
night
and
the
pig
which
had
been
squealing
with
hunger
was
row
grunting
with
satisfaction
over
her
evening
meal
fidel
was
gnawing
a
bone
and
father
van
hove
was
already
washing
his
hands
at
the
pump
beside
the
kitchen
door
you
are
all
good
children
said
the
mother
as
she
set
down
her
brimming
pail
and
took
her
turn
at
the
and
the
soap
jan
and
marie
have
you
washed
your
hands
i
have
called
marie
from
the
kitchen
and
supper
is
ready
and
the
table
set
i
washed
my
hands
in
the
canal
this
morning
pleaded
wo
that
do
you
ate
your
lunch
this
noon
too
answered
his
mother
promptly
wo
that
do
why
do
you
need
to
eat
again
when
you
have
already
eaten
twice
today
because
i
am
hungry
again
answered
well
you
are
also
dirty
again
said
his
mother
as
she
put
the
soap
in
his
hands
and
wiped
her
own
on
the
clean
towel
which
marie
handed
her
from
the
door
she
cleaned
her
wooden
shoes
on
the
bundle
of
straw
which
lay
for
the
purpose
beside
the
kitchen
door
then
she
went
inside
and
took
her
place
opposite
father
van
hove
at
the
little
round
oaken
table
by
the
window
marie
was
already
in
her
chair
and
in
a
moment
jan
joined
them
with
a
beaming
smile
and
a
face
which
though
clean
in
the
middle
showed
a
gray
border
from
ear
to
ear
if
you
do
believe
i
clean
look
at
the
towel
he
said
holding
it
up
oh
my
heart
cried
his
mother
throwing
up
her
hands
i
declare
there
but
one
creature
in
all
god
world
that
cares
nothing
for
cleanliness
even
a
pig
has
some
manners
if
given
half
a
chance
but
boys
she
seized
the
grimy
towel
and
held
it
up
despairingly
for
father
van
hove
to
see
he
just
wet
his
face
and
wiped
all
the
dirt
off
on
the
towel
the
devil
himself
is
not
more
afraid
of
holy
water
than
jan
van
hove
is
of
water
of
any
kind
she
cried
go
and
wash
yourself
properly
janke
said
his
father
sternly
and
jan
disappeared
through
the
kitchen
door
sounds
of
vigorous
pumping
and
splashing
without
were
heard
in
the
kitchen
and
when
jan
appeared
once
more
he
was
allowed
to
take
his
place
at
the
with
the
family
father
van
hove
bowed
his
head
and
the
twins
and
their
mother
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
with
him
as
he
began
their
grace
before
meat
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
amen
prayed
father
van
hove
hail
mary
full
of
grace
then
as
the
prayer
continued
the
mother
and
children
with
folded
hands
and
bowed
heads
joined
in
the
petition
holy
mary
mother
of
god
pray
for
us
sinners
now
and
in
the
hour
of
our
death
amen
a
clatter
of
spoons
followed
the
grace
and
mother
van
hove
good
buttermilk
pap
was
not
long
in
disappearing
down
their
four
hungry
throats
the
long
day
in
the
open
air
had
made
the
children
so
sleepy
they
could
scarcely
keep
their
eyes
open
through
the
meal
come
my
children
said
their
mother
briskly
as
she
rose
from
the
table
pop
into
bed
both
of
you
as
fast
as
you
can
go
you
are
already
half
asleep
father
you
help
them
with
their
buttons
and
hear
them
say
their
prayers
while
i
wash
up
these
dishes
and
take
care
of
the
milk
she
took
a
candle
from
the
as
she
spoke
and
started
down
cellar
with
the
skimmer
when
she
came
back
into
the
kitchen
once
more
the
children
were
safely
tucked
in
bed
and
her
husband
was
seated
by
the
kitchen
door
with
his
chair
tipped
back
against
the
wall
smoking
his
evening
pipe
mother
van
hove
cleared
the
table
washed
the
dishes
and
brushed
the
crumbs
from
the
tiled
floor
then
she
spread
the
white
sand
once
more
under
the
table
and
in
a
wide
border
around
the
edge
of
the
room
and
hung
the
brush
outside
the
kitchen
door
father
van
hove
smoked
in
silence
as
she
moved
about
the
room
at
last
he
said
to
her
leonie
did
you
hear
what
our
neighbor
maes
said
as
we
were
talking
in
the
road
no
said
his
wife
i
was
hurrying
home
to
get
supper
maes
said
there
are
rumors
of
a
german
army
on
our
frontier
said
father
van
hove
his
wife
paused
in
front
of
him
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
who
brought
that
story
to
town
she
demanded
jules
verhulst
answered
her
husband
jules
verhulst
sniffed
mother
van
hove
with
disdain
he
knows
more
things
that
are
so
than
any
man
in
this
village
i
would
believe
anything
on
his
besides
the
whole
world
knows
that
all
the
powers
have
agreed
that
belgium
shall
be
neutral
ground
and
have
bound
themselves
solemnly
to
protect
that
neutrality
i
learned
that
in
school
and
so
did
you
yes
sighed
father
van
hove
i
learned
it
too
and
surely
no
nation
can
have
anything
against
us
we
have
given
no
one
cause
for
complaint
that
i
know
of
it
nonsense
said
his
wife
with
decision
belgium
is
safe
enough
so
far
as
that
goes
but
one
certainly
has
to
work
hard
here
just
to
make
ends
meet
and
get
food
for
all
the
hungry
mouths
they
say
it
is
different
in
america
there
you
work
less
and
get
more
and
are
farther
away
from
meddlesome
neighboring
countries
besides
i
sometimes
wish
we
had
gone
there
with
my
sister
she
and
her
husband
started
with
no
more
than
we
have
and
now
they
are
rich
at
least
they
were
when
i
last
heard
from
them
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
she
finished
well
said
father
van
hove
as
he
stood
up
and
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
it
may
be
that
they
have
more
money
and
less
work
but
lived
here
in
this
spot
ever
since
i
was
born
and
my
father
before
me
somehow
i
feel
i
could
never
take
root
in
any
other
soil
i
content
with
things
as
they
are
so
am
i
for
the
matter
of
that
said
mother
van
hove
cheerfully
as
she
put
fidel
outside
and
shut
the
door
for
the
night
then
taking
the
candle
from
the
once
more
she
led
the
way
to
the
inner
room
where
the
twins
were
already
soundly
sleeping
iii
the
alarm
for
some
time
the
little
village
of
meer
slept
quietly
in
the
moonlight
there
was
not
a
sound
to
break
the
stillness
except
once
when
mother
van
hove
old
rooster
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
waning
moon
through
the
window
of
the
and
crowed
lustily
thinking
it
was
the
sun
the
other
roosters
of
the
village
wiser
than
he
made
no
response
to
his
call
and
in
a
moment
he
too
returned
to
his
interrupted
slumbers
but
though
there
was
as
yet
no
sound
to
tell
of
their
approach
the
moon
looked
down
upon
three
horsemen
galloping
over
the
yellow
ribbon
of
road
from
malines
toward
the
little
village
soon
the
sound
of
the
horses
hoofs
beating
upon
the
hardened
earth
throbbed
through
the
village
itself
and
fidel
sat
up
on
the
kitchen
doorstep
pricked
up
his
ears
and
listened
he
heard
the
and
awakened
the
echoes
with
a
sharp
bark
mother
van
hove
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
another
dog
barked
and
another
and
now
she
too
heard
the
nearer
they
came
and
nearer
and
now
she
could
hear
a
voice
shouting
she
shook
her
husband
wake
up
she
whispered
in
his
ear
something
is
wrong
fidel
barks
and
i
hear
strange
noises
about
wake
up
fidel
is
crazy
said
father
van
hove
sleepily
he
thinks
some
weasel
is
after
the
chickens
very
likely
fidel
will
attend
to
it
go
to
sleep
he
sank
back
again
upon
his
pillows
but
his
wife
seized
his
arm
and
pulled
him
up
listen
she
said
oh
listen
weasels
do
not
ride
on
horseback
there
are
on
the
road
some
neighbor
returning
late
from
malines
said
father
van
hove
yawning
it
does
not
concern
us
but
his
wife
was
already
out
of
bed
and
at
the
window
the
horsemen
were
now
plainly
visible
riding
like
the
wind
and
as
they
whirled
by
the
houses
their
shout
thrilled
through
the
quiet
streets
of
the
village
burghers
awake
awake
awake
wide
awake
at
last
father
van
hove
sprang
out
of
bed
and
hastily
began
putting
down
his
clothes
his
wife
was
already
nearly
dressed
and
had
lighted
a
candle
other
lights
sparkled
from
the
windows
of
other
houses
suddenly
the
bell
in
the
began
to
ring
wildly
as
though
it
too
were
shaken
with
a
sudden
terror
it
must
be
a
fire
said
father
van
hove
still
fastening
her
clothing
his
wife
ran
out
of
the
door
and
looked
about
in
every
direction
i
see
no
fire
she
said
but
the
village
street
is
full
of
people
running
to
the
square
hurry
hurry
we
must
take
the
children
with
us
they
must
not
be
left
here
alone
she
ran
to
wake
the
children
as
she
spoke
and
helped
by
her
trembling
fingers
they
too
were
soon
dressed
and
the
four
ran
together
up
the
road
toward
the
village
church
the
bell
still
clanged
madly
from
the
steeple
and
the
vibrations
seemed
to
shake
the
very
flesh
of
the
trembling
children
as
they
clung
to
their
mother
hands
and
tried
to
keep
up
with
their
father
rapid
strides
they
found
all
the
village
gathered
in
front
of
the
little
on
its
steps
stood
the
burgomeister
and
the
village
priest
and
near
them
still
sitting
astride
his
steed
was
one
of
the
soldiers
who
had
brought
the
alarm
his
two
companions
were
already
far
beyond
meer
flying
over
the
road
to
arouse
the
villages
which
lay
farther
to
the
east
the
suddenly
ceased
its
metallic
clatter
and
while
its
deep
tones
still
throbbed
through
the
night
air
the
wondering
and
frightened
people
crowded
about
the
steps
in
breathless
suspense
the
burgomeister
raised
his
hand
even
in
the
moonlight
it
could
be
seen
that
he
was
pale
he
spoke
quickly
neighbors
he
said
there
is
bad
news
the
german
army
is
on
our
borders
it
is
necessary
for
every
man
of
military
age
and
training
to
join
the
colors
at
once
in
case
the
army
is
needed
for
defense
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
this
messenger
is
from
headquarters
he
will
tell
you
what
you
are
to
do
the
soldier
now
spoke
for
the
first
time
men
of
belgium
he
cried
your
services
are
needed
for
your
country
and
your
king
the
men
of
meer
are
to
report
at
once
to
the
army
headquarters
at
malines
do
not
stop
even
to
change
your
clothing
we
are
not
yet
at
war
and
our
good
king
albert
still
hopes
to
avert
it
by
an
armed
peace
but
the
neutrality
of
belgium
is
at
stake
and
we
must
be
ready
to
protect
it
at
any
cost
and
at
an
instant
notice
go
at
once
to
the
brussels
gate
of
malines
an
officer
will
meet
you
there
and
tell
you
what
to
do
i
must
ride
on
to
carry
the
alarm
to
putte
he
wheeled
his
horse
as
he
spoke
and
turning
in
his
saddle
lifted
his
sword
and
cried
vive
le
roi
vive
le
roi
vive
la
belgique
came
in
an
answering
shout
from
the
people
of
meer
and
he
was
gone
there
was
a
moment
of
stunned
silence
as
he
rode
away
then
a
sound
of
women
weeping
the
burgomeister
came
down
from
the
steps
of
the
said
farewell
to
his
wife
and
children
and
took
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
little
group
of
men
which
was
already
beginning
form
in
marching
order
the
priest
moved
about
among
his
people
with
words
of
comfort
father
van
hove
turned
to
his
wife
and
to
jan
and
marie
who
were
clinging
to
her
skirts
it
is
only
a
bad
dream
my
little
ones
he
said
patting
their
heads
tenderly
we
shall
wake
up
some
day
and
you
my
wife
do
not
despair
i
shall
soon
return
no
doubt
our
good
king
will
yet
save
us
from
war
you
must
finish
the
harvest
alone
but
fall
in
cried
the
voice
of
the
burgomeister
and
father
van
hove
kissed
his
wife
and
children
and
stepped
forward
mother
van
hove
bravely
checked
her
rising
sobs
we
shall
go
with
you
to
malines
at
any
rate
she
said
firmly
and
as
the
little
group
of
men
started
forward
along
the
yellow
road
she
and
many
more
women
and
children
of
the
village
marched
away
with
them
in
the
gray
twilight
which
precedes
the
coming
of
the
dawn
the
priest
went
with
his
people
praying
for
them
as
he
walked
in
a
voice
that
shook
with
feeling
the
sky
was
red
in
the
east
and
the
larks
were
already
singing
over
the
quiet
fields
when
the
men
of
meer
followed
by
their
wives
and
children
presented
themselves
at
the
brussels
gate
of
the
city
iv
for
king
for
law
and
liberty
at
the
gate
they
were
met
by
an
officer
who
at
once
took
command
of
the
company
there
was
only
a
moment
for
hasty
before
the
order
to
march
was
given
and
the
women
and
children
watched
the
little
column
stride
bravely
away
up
the
street
toward
the
armory
where
the
uniforms
and
arms
were
kept
they
followed
at
a
little
distance
and
took
up
their
station
across
the
street
from
the
great
doors
through
which
the
men
had
disappeared
there
was
little
talking
among
them
only
the
voice
of
the
priest
could
be
heard
now
and
then
as
he
said
a
few
words
to
one
and
another
of
the
waiting
women
it
was
still
so
early
in
the
morning
that
the
streets
of
the
city
were
not
yet
filled
with
people
going
to
work
only
those
like
themselves
concerned
with
the
sad
business
of
war
were
abroad
to
jan
and
marie
the
long
wait
seemed
endless
but
at
last
the
doors
of
the
armory
sprang
open
there
was
a
burst
of
martial
music
and
a
band
playing
the
national
hymn
appeared
for
king
for
law
and
liberty
thrilled
the
bugles
and
amidst
the
waving
of
flags
and
the
cheers
of
the
people
who
had
now
begun
to
fill
the
streets
a
regiment
of
soldiers
marched
away
toward
the
north
jan
and
marie
stood
with
their
mother
on
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
eagerly
scanning
every
face
as
the
soldiers
passed
and
at
last
jan
shouted
i
see
father
i
see
father
mother
van
hove
lifted
her
two
children
high
in
her
arms
for
him
to
see
but
father
van
hove
could
only
smile
a
brave
as
he
marched
swiftly
past
no
tears
my
children
cried
the
priest
let
them
see
no
tears
send
them
away
with
a
smile
and
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
raised
his
hand
in
blessing
as
the
troops
went
by
for
a
time
mother
van
hove
and
the
children
ran
along
the
sidewalk
trying
to
keep
pace
with
the
soldiers
but
their
quick
strides
were
too
much
for
the
twins
and
it
was
not
long
before
marie
said
breathlessly
my
legs
are
too
short
i
ca
run
so
fast
i
ca
too
gasped
jan
mother
van
hove
stopped
short
at
once
and
the
three
stood
still
hand
in
hand
and
watched
the
soldiers
until
they
turned
a
corner
and
disappeared
from
sight
through
the
antwerp
gate
of
the
city
they
were
quite
alone
for
the
other
women
and
children
had
gone
no
farther
than
the
armory
and
were
already
on
their
homeward
way
to
meer
now
for
the
first
time
mother
van
hove
gave
way
to
grief
and
jan
and
marie
wept
with
her
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
then
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
the
twins
too
on
her
apron
and
said
firmly
come
my
lambs
tears
will
not
bring
him
back
we
must
go
home
now
as
fast
as
we
can
there

marie

our
little
we
must
be
as
brave
as

even
though
we
can
not
fight
i
think
i
could
be
braver
if
i
had
some
breakfast
sobbed
janke
mother
van
hove
struck
her
hands
together
in
dismay
i
never
once
thought
of
food
she
cried
and
i
have
a
red
cent
with
me
we
can
not
buy
a
breakfast
we
must
just
go
hungry
until

often
go
hungry
my
little
ones
we
must
be
as
brave
as
they
come
now
i
will
be
the
captain
forward
march
jan
and
marie
stiffened
their
little
backs
as
she
gave
the
word
of
command
and
shoulder
to
shoulder
they
marched
down
the
street
toward
the
city
gate
to
the
martial
refrain
le
roi
la
loi
la
liberte
which
mother
van
hove
hummed
for
them
under
her
breath
it
was
a
long
way
back
to
the
little
and
when
at
last
the
three
weary
pilgrims
reached
it
they
were
met
by
an
indignant
chorus
of
protests
from
all
the
creatures
which
had
been
left
behind
bel
was
lowing
at
the
pasture
bars
the
pig
was
squealing
angrily
in
her
pen
the
rooster
had
crowed
himself
hoarse
and
fidel
patient
fidel
was
sitting
on
guard
at
the
back
door
mother
van
hove
flew
into
the
kitchen
the
moment
she
reached
the
house
and
in
two
minutes
jan
and
marie
were
seated
before
a
breakfast
of
bread
and
milk
then
she
fed
the
pig
let
out
the
hens
and
gave
fidel
a
bone
which
she
had
saved
for
him
from
the
soup
last
of
all
she
milked
the
cow
and
when
this
was
done
and
she
had
had
a
cup
of
coffee
herself
the
clock
in
the
steeple
struck
twelve
even
mother
van
hove
strength
was
not
equal
to
work
in
the
that
day
but
she
stowed
the
load
of
wheat
which
had
been
brought
home
the
night
before
in
the
barn
and
after
the
chores
were
done
at
night
she
and
the
twins
went
straight
to
bed
and
slept
as
only
the
very
weary
can
until
the
sun
streamed
into
their
windows
in
the
morning
v
doing
a
man
work
when
jan
and
marie
awoke
their
mother
bed
was
empty
she
gone
to
milk
the
cow
cried
marie

will
surprise
her

from
the
pasture

will
have
breakfast

said
jan
as
he
struggled
into
his
clothes
and
twisted
himself
nearly
in
two
trying
to
do
up
the
buttons
in
the
back
you
can
but
i
must
do
a
man

said
importantly

wheat
harvest

said
marie
you
will
spill
the
all
over

such
a
messy
boy
i
guess

do
it
just
as
well
as
you
can
make
coffee
said
jan
with
spirit
you
never
made
coffee
in
your
life
i
watched
mother

it
lots
of
times
said
marie
i
sure
i
can
do
it
just
the
same
way
all
right
let
see
you
do
it
then
said
and
he
strode
out
of
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
taking
as
long
steps
as
his
short
legs
would
permit
when
she
was
dressed
and
washed
marie
ran
to
the
pump
and
filled
the
kettle
then
she
stirred
the
embers
of
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
and
put
on
fresh
coal
she
set
the
kettle
on
to
boil
and
only
slopped
a
little
water
on
her
apron
in
doing
so
then
she
put
the
dishes
on
the
table
meanwhile
she
heard
no
sound
from
she
went
to
the
kitchen
door
and
looked
out
jan
had
already
let
out
the
fowls
and
was
just
in
the
act
of
feeding
the
pig
he
had
climbed
up
on
the
fence
around
the
and
by
dint
of
great
effort
had
succeeded
in
lifting
the
heavy
pail
of
feed
to
the
top
of
it
he
was
now
trying
to
let
it
down
on
the
other
side
and
pour
the
contents
into
the
trough
but
the
pig
was
greedy
and
the
moment
the
pail
came
within
reach
she
stuck
her
nose
and
her
fore
feet
into
it
this
added
weight
was
too
much
for
poor
jan
down
went
the
pail
with
a
crash
into
the
trough
and
jan
himself
tumbled
suddenly
forward
his
feet
flew
out
behind
and
he
was
left
hanging
head
down
like
a
jack
knife
over
the
fence
it
was
just
at
this
moment
that
marie
came
to
the
door
and
when
she
saw
jan
balancing
on
the
fence
and
kicking
out
wildly
with
his
feet
she
screamed
with
laughter
jan
was
screaming
too
but
with
pain
and
indignation
come
here
and
pick
me
off
this
fence
he
roared
it
cutting
me
in
two
oh
mother
mother
marie
ran
to
the
pigpen
as
fast
as
she
could
go
she
snatched
an
old
box
by
the
stable
as
she
ran
and
placing
it
against
the
fence
seized
one
of
jan
feet
which
were
still
waving
wildly
in
the
air
and
planted
it
firmly
on
the
box
oh
oh
laughed
marie
as
jan
reached
the
ground
once
more
if
you
could
only
have
seen
yourself
jan
you
would
have
laughed
too
instead
of
pouring
the
on
to
yourself
you
poured
yourself
on
to
the
i
do
see
anything
to
laugh
at
said
jan
with
dignity
it
might
have
happened
to
any
man
anyway
you
have
to
get
the
pail
again
said
marie
wiping
her
eyes
that
greedy
pig
will
bang
it
all
to
pieces
if
you
leave
it
in
the
pen
i
ca
reach
it
said
yes
you
can
said
marie
i
hold
your
legs
so
you
wo
fall
in
and
you
can
fish
for
it
with
a
stick
she
ran
for
a
stick
to
poke
with
while
jan
bravely
mounted
the
box
again
and
firmly
anchored
by
marie
grasp
upon
his
legs
he
soon
succeeded
in
rescuing
the
pail
anyway
i
guess
i
fed
the
pig
just
as
well
as
you
have
made
the
coffee
he
said
as
he
handed
it
over
to
marie
oh
my
sakes
cried
marie
i
forgot
all
about
the
coffee
and
she
ran
back
to
the
kitchen
to
find
that
the
kettle
had
boiled
over
and
put
the
fire
out
jan
stuck
hid
head
in
the
door
just
as
she
got
the
bellows
to
start
the
fire
again
what
did
i
tell
you
he
shouted
running
out
his
tongue
derisively
scat
said
marie
shaking
the
bellows
at
him
and
jan
sauntered
away
toward
the
pasture
with
pier
halter
over
his
arm
pier
had
been
eating
grass
for
two
nights
and
a
day
without
doing
any
work
and
it
took
jan
some
time
to
catch
him
and
put
the
halter
over
his
head
when
at
last
he
returned
from
the
pasture
red
and
tired
but
triumphant
leading
pier
marie
and
her
mother
had
already
finished
their
breakfast
look
what
a
man
we
have
cried
mother
van
hove
as
jan
appeared
he
has
caught
pier
all
by
himself
he
lifted
me
clear
off
my
feet
when
i
put
his
halter
on
said
jan
proudly
but
i
hung
on
and
he
had
to
come
marie
cried
her
mother
our
jan
has
earned
a
good
breakfast
cook
an
egg
for
him
while
i
hitch
pier
to
the
cart
then
while
he
and
i
work
in
the
field
you
can
put
the
house
in
order
there
is
only
one
more
load
to
bring
in
and
we
can
do
that
by
ourselves
by
noon
the
last
of
the
wheat
had
been
garnered
and
this
time
jan
drove
pier
home
while
his
mother
sat
on
the
load
in
the
afternoon
the
three
unloaded
the
wagon
and
stowed
the
grain
away
in
the
barn
to
be
threshed
and
when
the
long
day
work
was
over
and
they
had
eaten
their
simple
supper
of
bread
and
milk
mother
van
hove
and
the
children
went
together
down
the
village
street
to
see
their
neighbors
and
hear
the
news
if
there
should
be
any
there
were
no
daily
papers
in
meer
and
now
there
were
no
young
men
to
go
to
the
city
and
bring
back
the
gossip
of
the
day
as
there
had
used
to
be
the
women
with
their
babies
on
their
arms
stood
about
in
the
street
talking
quietly
and
sadly
among
themselves
on
the
doorsteps
a
few
old
men
lingered
together
over
their
pipes
already
the
bigger
boys
were
playing
soldier
with
paper
caps
on
their
heads
and
sticks
for
guns
the
smaller
children
were
shouting
and
chasing
each
other
through
the
little
street
of
the
village
jan
and
marie
joined
in
a
game
of
blindman
buff
while
mother
van
hove
stopped
with
the
group
of
women
if
we
only
knew
what
to
expect
sighed
the
burgomeister
wife
as
she
shifted
her
baby
from
one
arm
to
the
other
it
seems
as
if
we
should
know
better
what
to
do
in
a
day
or
two
i
shall
send
my
big
boy
leon
to
the
city
for
a
paper
it
is
hard
to
wait
quietly
and
know
nothing
our
good
king
and
queen
doubtless
know
everything
said
the
wife
of
boer
maes
they
will
do
better
for
us
than
we
could
do
for
ourselves
even
if
we
knew
all
that
they
do
and
there
are
our
own
brave
men
besides
added
mother
van
hove
we
must
not
forget
them
we
are
not
yet
at
war
i
pray
god
we
may
not
be
and
that
we
shall
soon
see
them
come
marching
home
again
to
tell
us
that
the
trouble
whatever
it
is
is
over
and
that
we
may
go
on
living
in
peace
as
we
did
before
it
seems
a
year
since
yesterday
said
the
burgomeister
wife
work
makes
the
time
pass
quickly
said
mother
van
hove
cheerfully
jan
and
i
got
in
the
last
of
our
wheat
he
helped
me
like
a
man
who
will
thresh
it
for
you
asked
the
wife
of
boer
maes
i
will
thresh
it
myself
if
need
be
said
mother
van
hove
with
spirit
my
good
man
shall
not
come
home
and
find
the
behind
if
i
can
help
it
and
with
these
brave
words
she
said
to
the
other
women
called
jan
and
marie
and
turned
once
more
down
the
street
toward
the
little
house
on
the
edge
of
the
village
far
across
the
peaceful
twilight
fields
came
the
sound
of
distant
bells
hark
said
mother
van
hove
to
the
twins
the
cathedral
bells
of
malines
and
they
are
playing
lion
of
flanders
three
lines
of
music
sang
the
bells
and
standing
upon
the
threshold
of
her
little
home
with
head
held
proudly
erect
mother
van
hove
lifted
her
voice
and
joined
the
words
to
the
melody
they
will
never
conquer
him
the
old
lion
of
flanders
so
long
as
he
has
claws
she
sang
and
the
twins
looking
up
into
her
brave
and
inspired
face
sang
too
vi
at
the
church
several
days
passed
quietly
by
in
the
little
village
of
meer
the
sun
shone
and
the
wind
blew
and
the
rains
fell
upon
the
peaceful
fields
just
as
if
nothing
whatever
had
happened
each
day
was
filled
to
the
brim
with
hard
work
with
the
help
of
the
twins
mother
van
hove
kept
the
garden
free
of
weeds
and
took
care
of
the
stock
she
even
threshed
the
wheat
herself
with
her
husband
flail
and
stored
the
grain
away
in
sacks
ready
for
the
mill
each
evening
when
the
work
was
done
the
three
went
down
the
village
street
together
one
evening
just
at
dusk
they
found
nearly
the
whole
village
gathered
in
front
of
the
house
next
to
the
church
leon
the
burgomeister
oldest
boy
had
been
to
malines
that
day
and
had
brought
back
a
paper
the
priest
was
reading
from
it
to
the
anxious
group
gathered
about
him
oh
my
children
he
was
saying
as
mother
van
hove
and
the
twins
joined
the
group
there
is
no
doubt
need
for
courage
but
where
is
there
a
belgian
lacking
in
that
even
julius
caesar
two
thousand
years
ago
found
that
out
the
bravest
of
all
are
the
belgians
he
said
then
and
it
is
none
the
less
true
the
germans
have
crossed
our
eastern
frontier
it
is
reported
that
they
are
already
burning
towns
and
killing
the
inhabitants
if
they
resist
god
knows
what
may
be
before
us
our
good
king
albert
has
asked
parliament
to
refuse
the
demands
of
the
germans
in
spite
of
their
solemn
treaty
with
us
they
demand
that
we
permit
them
to
cross
belgium
to
attack
france
to
this
our
brave
king
and
parliament
will
never
consent
no
true
belgian
would
wish
them
to
there
is
then
this
choice
either
to
submit
absolutely
to
the
invasion
of
our
country
or
to
defend
it
the
army
is
already
in
the
field
there
was
a
moment
of
heavy
silence
as
he
finished
speaking
then
the
voice
of
the
burgomeister
wife
was
heard
in
the
stillness
oh
mynheer
pastoor
she
said
to
the
priest
what
shall
we
do
there
is
no
place
to
go
to
we
have
no
refuge
god
is
our
refuge
and
strength
my
children
said
the
priest
lifting
his
eyes
to
heaven
we
have
no
other
you
must
stay
here
and
if
the
terrible
germans
come
hide
yourselves
away
as
best
you
can
until
they
have
passed
by
do
not
anger
them
by
resisting
bow
your
heads
to
the
storm
and
have
faith
in
god
that
it
may
soon
pass
over
he
turned
and
led
the
way
toward
the
little
church
as
he
spoke
come
he
said
let
us
pray
before
god
holy
altar
and
if
the
enemy
comes
seek
refuge
in
the
church
itself
surely
even
the
germans
will
respect
the
sanctuary
solemnly
the
people
filed
into
the
little
church
lighted
only
by
the
candles
on
the
altar
and
knelt
upon
the
hard
floor
the
priest
left
them
there
praying
silently
while
he
went
to
put
on
the
robes
of
his
offices
then
once
more
he
appeared
before
the
altar
and
led
the
kneeling
congregation
in
the
litany
from
war
and
pestilence
and
sudden
death
good
lord
deliver
us
he
prayed
at
last
and
all
the
people
responded
with
a
fervent
amen
that
night
when
she
put
her
children
to
bed
mother
van
hove
fastened
a
chain
with
a
locket
upon
it
about
marie
neck
listen
ma
mie
she
said
and
you
too
my
little
god
only
knows
what
may
be
before
us
this
locket
contains
my
picture
you
must
wear
it
always
about
your
neck
and
remember
that
your
mother
name
is
leonie
van
hove
and
your
father
name
is
georges
van
hove
if
by
any
chance
which
god
forbid
we
should
become
separated
from
one
another
keep
the
locket
on
your
neck
and
our
names
in
your
memory
until
we
meet
again
for
if
such
a
thing
should
happen
do
not
doubt
that
i
should
find
you
though
i
had
to
swim
the
sea
to
do
it
for
you
my
jan
i
have
no
locket
but
you
are
a
man
a
brave
man
now
you
must
take
care
of
yourself
and
your
sister
too
if
need
should
arise
and
above
all
remember
this
only
the
brave
are
safe
whatever
happens
you
must
remember
that
you
are
belgians
and
be
brave
the
children
clung
to
her
weeping
as
she
finished
there
there
she
said
soothingly
i
had
to
tell
you
this
so
you
would
be
ready
to
do
your
best
and
not
despair
whatever
might
happen
but
be
sure
my
lambs
nothing
shall
harm
you
if
i
can
help
it
and
nothing
shall
separate
us
from
one
another
if
god
so
wills
now
go
to
sleep
she
kissed
them
tenderly
and
quite
comforted
they
nestled
down
in
their
beds
and
soon
were
asleep
she
herself
slept
but
little
that
night
long
after
the
children
were
quiet
she
sat
alone
on
the
kitchen
step
in
the
darkness
with
fidel
by
her
side
and
listened
to
the
faint
sounds
of
distant
guns
and
watched
the
red
light
in
the
sky
which
told
her
of
the
burning
of
louvain
vii
the
tidal
wave
of
germans
the
next
morning
dawned
bright
and
clear
and
mother
van
hove
and
the
twins
went
about
their
work
as
usual
the
sunshine
was
so
bright
and
the
whole
countryside
looked
so
peaceful
and
fair
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
the
terrors
of
the
night
could
be
true
we
must
begin
to
gather
the
potatoes
said
mother
van
hove
after
breakfast
jan
you
get
the
fork
and
hoe
and
put
them
in
the
wagon
while
i
milk
the
cow
and
marie
puts
up
some
bread
and
cheese
for
us
to
take
to
the
field
she
started
across
the
road
to
the
pasture
with
fidel
at
her
heels
as
she
spoke
in
an
instant
she
was
back
again
her
eyes
wide
with
horror
look
look
she
cried
the
dazed
children
looked
toward
the
east
as
she
pointed
there
in
the
distance
advancing
like
a
great
tidal
wave
was
a
long
gray
line
of
soldiers
on
horseback
already
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
music
and
the
throb
of
drums
already
the
sun
glistened
upon
the
shining
helmets
and
the
cruel
points
of
bayonets
the
host
stretched
away
across
the
plain
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
behind
them
the
sky
was
thick
with
the
smoke
of
fires
the
church
the
church
cried
mother
van
hove
no
there
is
not
time
hide
in
here
my
darlings
quickly
quickly
she
tore
open
the
door
of
the
vegetable
cellar
as
she
spoke
and
thrust
jan
and
marie
inside
fidel
bolted
in
after
them
do
not
move
or
make
a
sound
until
all
is
quiet
again
she
cried
as
she
closed
the
door
there
was
not
room
for
her
too
in
the
cellar
and
if
there
had
been
mother
van
hove
would
not
have
taken
it
for
it
was
necessary
to
close
the
door
from
the
outside
this
she
did
hastily
throwing
some
straw
before
it
then
she
rushed
into
the
house
and
snatching
up
her
shining
flung
them
upon
the
straw
as
if
they
were
placed
there
to
be
sweetened
by
the
sun
no
one
would
think
to
look
under
a
pile
of
pans
for
hidden
belgians
she
felt
sure
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
hosts
and
now
she
could
hear
the
sound
of
singing
as
from
ten
thousand
brazen
throats
deutschland
deutschland
uber
alles
roared
the
mighty
chorus
and
in
another
moment
the
little
village
of
meer
was
submerged
in
the
terrible
gray
flood
at
last
after
what
seemed
to
the
imprisoned
children
like
a
year
of
darkness
and
dread
and
of
strange
terrifying
noises
of
all
kinds
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
and
marching
feet
died
away
in
the
distance
and
jan
ventured
to
push
open
the
door
of
the
cavern
a
crack
just
intending
to
peep
out
immediately
there
was
a
crash
of
falling
tinware
jan
quickly
drew
back
again
into
the
safe
darkness
and
waited
as
nothing
further
happened
he
peeped
out
again
this
time
fidel
springing
forward
flung
the
doors
wide
open
and
dashed
out
into
the
sunshine
with
a
joyous
bark
in
a
moment
more
jan
and
marie
also
crawled
out
of
their
after
him
for
an
instant
as
they
came
out
into
the
daylight
it
seemed
to
the
children
as
if
they
had
awakened
from
a
dreadful
dream
there
stood
the
farmhouse
just
as
before
with
the
kitchen
door
wide
open
and
the
sun
streaming
in
upon
the
sanded
floor
there
were
only
the
marks
of
many
feet
in
the
soft
earth
of
the
farmyard
an
empty
pigpen
and
a
few
chicken
feathers
blowing
about
the
hen
house
to
show
where
the
invaders
had
been
and
what
they
had
carried
away
with
them
jan
and
marie
followed
by
fidel
ran
through
the
house
from
the
front
door
which
opened
on
the
road
they
could
see
the
long
gray
line
sweeping
across
the
fields
toward
malines
the
storm
has
passed
cried
marie
sobbing
with
grief
just
as
mynheer
pastoor
said
it
would
mother
mother
where
are
you
they
ran
from
kitchen
to
bedroom
and
back
again
their
terror
increasing
at
every
step
as
no
voice
answered
their
call
they
searched
the
cellar
and
the
loft
they
looked
in
the
stable
and
barn
and
even
in
the
their
mother
was
nowhere
to
be
found
i
know
where
she
must
be
cried
jan
at
last
you
know
mynheer
pastoor
said
if
anything
happened
we
should
hide
in
the
church
led
by
this
hope
the
two
children
sped
hand
in
hand
toward
the
village
bel
is
gone
gasped
jan
as
they
passed
the
pasture
bars
pier
too
sobbed
marie
down
the
whole
length
of
the
deserted
village
street
they
flew
with
fidel
following
close
at
their
heels
when
they
came
to
the
little
church
they
burst
open
the
door
and
looked
in
the
cheerful
sun
streamed
through
the
windows
falling
in
brilliant
patches
of
light
upon
the
floor
but
the
church
was
silent
and
empty
it
was
some
time
before
they
could
realize
that
there
was
not
a
human
being
but
themselves
in
the
entire
village
all
the
others
had
been
driven
away
like
sheep
before
the
invading
army
when
at
last
the
terrible
truth
dawned
upon
them
the
two
frightened
children
sat
down
upon
the
church
steps
in
the
silence
and
clung
weeping
to
each
other
fidel
whined
and
licked
their
hands
as
though
he
too
understood
and
felt
their
loneliness
what
shall
we
do
what
shall
we
do
moaned
marie
there
nobody
to
tell
us
what
to
do
sobbed
we
must
just
do
the
best
we
can
by
ourselves
we
ca
stay
here
alone
said
marie
but
where
can
we
go
cried
there
no
place
for
us
to
go
to
for
a
few
minutes
the
two
children
wept
their
hearts
out
in
utter
despair
but
hope
always
comes
when
it
is
most
needed
and
soon
marie
raised
her
head
and
wiped
her
eyes
do
you
remember
what
mother
said
when
she
put
the
locket
on
my
neck
jan
she
asked
she
said
that
she
would
find
us
even
if
she
had
to
swim
the
sea
she
said
no
matter
what
happened
we
should
never
despair
and
here
we
are
despairing
as
hard
as
ever
we
can
jan
threw
up
his
chin
and
straightened
his
back
yes
he
said
swallowing
his
sobs
and
she
said
i
was
now
a
man
and
must
take
care
of
myself
and
you
what
shall
we
do
then
asked
marie
jan
thought
hard
for
a
moment
then
he
said
eat
it
must
be
late
and
we
have
not
had
a
mouthful
marie
stood
up
yes
said
she
we
must
eat
let
us
go
back
home
the
clock
in
the
steeple
struck
eleven
as
the
two
children
ran
once
more
through
the
deserted
street
and
began
a
search
for
food
in
their
empty
house
they
found
that
the
invaders
had
been
as
thorough
within
the
house
as
without
not
only
had
they
carried
away
the
grain
which
their
mother
had
worked
so
hard
to
thresh
but
they
had
cleaned
the
cupboard
as
well
the
hungry
children
found
nothing
but
a
few
crusts
of
bread
a
bit
of
cheese
and
some
milk
in
the
cellar
but
with
these
and
two
eggs
which
jan
knew
where
to
look
for
in
the
straw
in
the
barn
they
made
an
excellent
breakfast
they
gave
fidel
the
last
of
the
milk
and
then
much
refreshed
made
ready
to
start
upon
a
strange
and
lonely
journey
the
end
of
which
they
did
not
know
they
tied
their
best
clothes
in
a
bundle
which
jan
hung
upon
a
stick
over
his
shoulder
and
were
just
about
to
leave
the
house
when
marie
cried
out
suppose
mother
should
come
back
and
find
us
gone
we
must
leave
word
where
we
have
gone
so
she
will
know
where
to
look
for
us
of
course
jan
answered
capably
yes
but
how
persisted
marie
there
no
one
to
leave
word
with
this
was
a
hard
puzzle
but
jan
soon
found
a
way
out
we
must
write
a
note
and
pin
it
up
where
she
would
be
sure
to
find
it
he
said
the
very
thing
said
marie
they
found
a
bit
of
charcoal
and
a
piece
of
and
jan
was
all
ready
to
write
when
a
new
difficulty
presented
itself
what
shall
i
say
he
said
to
marie
we
do
know
where
we
are
going
we
do
know
the
way
to
any
place
but
malines
said
marie
so
have
to
go
there
i
suppose
how
do
you
spell
malines
asked
jan
charcoal
in
hand
oh
you
stupid
boy
cried
marie
of
course
jan
put
the
paper
down
on
the
kitchen
floor
and
got
down
before
it
on
his
hands
and
knees
he
had
not
yet
learned
to
write
but
he
managed
to
print
upon
it
in
great
staggering
letters
dear
mother
we
have
gone
to
malines
to
find
you
jan
and
marie
this
note
they
pinned
upon
the
inside
of
the
kitchen
door
now
we
are
ready
to
start
said
jan
and
calling
fidel
the
two
children
set
forth
they
took
a
short
cut
from
the
house
across
the
pasture
to
the
here
they
dug
a
few
potatoes
which
they
put
in
their
bundle
and
then
avoiding
the
road
slipped
down
to
the
river
and
following
the
stream
made
their
way
toward
malines
it
was
fortunate
for
them
that
screened
by
the
bushes
and
trees
which
fringed
the
bank
of
the
river
they
saw
but
little
of
the
ruin
and
devastation
left
in
the
wake
of
the
german
hosts
there
were
farmers
who
had
tried
to
defend
their
families
and
homes
from
the
invaders
burning
houses
and
barns
marked
the
places
where
they
had
lived
and
died
but
the
children
thinking
only
of
their
lost
mother
and
of
keeping
themselves
as
much
out
of
sight
as
possible
in
their
search
for
her
were
spared
most
of
these
horrors
their
progress
was
slow
for
the
bundle
was
heavy
and
the
river
path
less
direct
than
the
road
and
it
was
nightfall
before
the
two
little
waifs
with
fidel
at
their
heels
reached
the
brussels
gate
their
hearts
almost
stopped
beating
when
they
found
it
guarded
by
a
german
soldier
who
goes
there
demanded
the
guard
gruffly
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
little
figures
if
you
please
sir
it
jan
and
marie
said
jan
shaking
in
his
boots
and
fidel
too
said
marie
the
soldier
bent
down
and
looked
closely
at
the
two
little
faces
it
may
be
that
some
remembrance
of
other
little
faces
stirred
within
him
for
he
only
said
stiffly
pass
jan
and
marie
and
you
too
fidel
and
the
two
children
and
the
dog
hurried
through
the
gate
and
up
the
first
street
they
came
to
their
bundle
bumping
along
behind
them
as
they
ran
the
city
seemed
strangely
silent
and
deserted
except
for
the
soldiers
and
armed
guards
blocked
the
way
at
intervals
taught
by
fear
jan
and
marie
soon
learned
to
slip
quietly
along
under
cover
of
the
gathering
darkness
and
to
dodge
into
a
doorway
or
round
a
corner
when
they
came
too
near
one
of
the
stiff
helmeted
figures
at
last
after
an
hour
of
aimless
wandering
they
found
themselves
in
a
large
open
square
looking
up
at
the
tall
cathedral
spires
a
german
soldier
came
suddenly
out
of
the
shadows
and
the
frightened
children
scarcely
knowing
what
they
did
ran
up
the
cathedral
steps
and
flung
themselves
against
the
door
when
the
soldier
had
passed
by
they
reached
cautiously
up
and
by
dint
of
pulling
with
their
united
strength
succeeded
at
last
in
getting
the
door
open
they
thrust
their
bundle
inside
pushed
fidel
in
after
it
and
then
slipped
through
themselves
the
great
door
closed
behind
them
on
silent
hinges
and
they
were
alone
in
the
vast
stillness
of
the
cathedral
timidly
they
crept
toward
the
lights
of
the
altar
and
utterly
exhausted
slept
that
night
on
the
floor
near
the
statue
of
the
madonna
with
their
heads
pillowed
on
fidel
shaggy
side
viii
granny
and
the
eels
when
the
cathedral
bells
rang
the
next
morning
for
early
mass
the
children
were
still
sleeping
the
sleep
of
utter
exhaustion
it
was
not
until
the
bells
had
ceased
to
ring
and
the
door
opening
from
the
sacristy
near
their
resting
place
creaked
upon
its
hinges
that
even
fidel
was
aroused
true
to
his
watchdog
instincts
he
started
to
his
feet
with
a
low
growl
letting
the
heads
of
jan
and
marie
down
upon
the
floor
with
a
sudden
bump
for
an
instant
the
awakened
children
could
not
remember
where
they
were
or
what
had
happened
to
them
they
sat
up
and
rubbed
their
heads
but
the
habit
of
fear
was
already
so
strong
upon
them
that
they
made
no
sound
and
instantly
quieted
fidel
again
the
door
creaked
and
through
it
there
appeared
a
tall
figure
dressed
in
priestly
robes
the
children
were
so
near
that
had
they
thrust
their
hands
through
the
railing
of
the
communion
bank
behind
which
they
were
concealed
they
might
have
touched
him
as
he
passed
before
the
altar
of
the
virgin
and
presented
himself
in
front
of
the
high
altar
to
conduct
the
mass
his
head
as
he
passed
them
was
bowed
his
face
was
pale
and
thin
and
marked
with
lines
of
deep
sorrow
oh
whispered
marie
to
jan
it
must
be
the
cardinal
himself
mother
told
me
about
him
the
whisper
made
such
a
loud
sound
in
the
silence
of
the
great
cathedral
aisles
that
jan
was
afraid
to
reply
for
answer
he
only
laid
his
finger
upon
his
lips
and
crept
still
farther
back
into
the
shadow
fidel
seemed
to
know
that
dogs
were
not
allowed
in
church
and
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
be
quiet
too
for
he
crawled
back
with
the
children
into
the
sheltering
darkness
there
were
only
a
few
persons
in
the
cathedral
and
those
few
were
near
the
door
so
no
one
saw
the
children
as
they
knelt
with
folded
hands
and
bowed
heads
in
their
corner
reverently
following
the
service
as
the
cardinal
ate
the
sacred
wafer
and
drank
the
communion
wine
before
the
altar
later
they
were
to
know
his
face
as
the
bravest
and
best
beloved
in
all
belgium
next
to
those
of
the
king
and
queen
themselves
when
again
he
passed
the
kneeling
little
figures
on
his
return
to
the
sacristy
their
lonely
hearts
so
ached
for
care
and
protection
and
his
face
looked
so
kind
and
pitiful
that
they
almost
dared
to
make
their
presence
known
and
to
ask
for
the
help
they
sorely
needed
marie
bolder
than
jan
half
rose
as
he
passed
but
jan
pulled
her
back
and
in
another
instant
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
and
he
was
gone
oh
sobbed
marie
under
her
breath
he
looked
so
kind
he
might
have
helped
us
why
did
you
pull
me
back
how
could
we
let
him
see
fidel
and
tell
him
that
our
dog
had
slept
all
night
before
the
altar
answered
i
should
dare
he
is
a
great
prince
of
the
church
the
sound
of
scraping
chairs
told
them
that
the
little
congregation
had
risen
from
its
knees
and
was
passing
out
of
the
church
they
waited
until
every
one
had
disappeared
through
the
great
door
and
then
made
a
swift
flight
down
the
echoing
aisle
and
out
into
the
sunlight
for
a
moment
they
stood
hand
in
hand
upon
the
cathedral
steps
clasping
their
bundle
and
waiting
for
the
next
turn
of
fortune
wheel
the
bright
sunlight
of
the
summer
day
shining
on
the
open
square
almost
blinded
them
and
what
they
saw
in
the
square
when
their
eyes
had
become
used
to
it
did
not
comfort
them
everywhere
there
were
german
soldiers
with
their
terrible
bayonets
and
pointed
helmets
and
their
terrible
songs
everywhere
there
were
pale
and
desperate
belgians
fleeing
before
the
arrogant
german
invader
oh
jan
whispered
marie
clinging
to
him
there
are
so
many
people
how
shall
we
ever
find
mother
i
did
know
there
were
so
many
people
in
the
whole
world
it
is
likely
that
we
find
her
by
just
standing
here
anyway
answered
we
got
to
keep
going
till
we
get
somewhere
he
slung
the
bundle
on
his
shoulder
and
whistled
to
fidel
who
had
gone
down
the
steps
to
bark
at
a
homeless
cat
come
along
he
said
to
marie
and
once
more
the
little
pilgrims
took
up
their
journey
at
the
first
corner
they
paused
not
knowing
whether
to
go
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
which
way
said
marie
jan
stood
still
and
looked
first
in
one
direction
and
then
in
the
other
here
what
are
you
standing
here
for
make
way
for
your
betters
said
a
gruff
voice
behind
them
and
turning
the
children
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
a
german
officer
dressed
in
a
resplendent
uniform
and
accompanied
by
a
group
of
swaggering
young
soldiers
too
frightened
to
move
the
children
only
looked
up
at
him
and
did
not
stir
get
out
of
the
way
i
tell
you
roared
the
officer
turning
purple
with
rage
orderly
one
of
the
young
men
sprang
forward
he
seized
jan
by
the
arm
and
deftly
kicked
him
into
the
gutter
another
at
the
same
moment
laid
his
hands
on
marie
but
he
reckoned
without
fidel
faithful
fidel
who
knew
no
difference
between
german
and
belgian
but
knew
only
that
no
cruel
hand
should
touch
his
beloved
marie
while
he
was
there
to
defend
her
with
a
fierce
growl
he
sprang
at
the
young
orderly
and
buried
his
teeth
in
his
leg
howling
with
pain
the
orderly
dropped
marie
while
another
soldier
drew
his
sword
with
an
oath
and
made
a
thrust
at
fidel
fortunately
fidel
was
too
quick
for
him
he
let
go
his
hold
upon
the
leg
of
the
orderly
tearing
a
large
hole
in
his
uniform
as
he
did
so
and
flung
himself
directly
between
the
legs
of
the
other
soldier
who
was
lunging
at
him
with
the
sword
the
next
instant
the
surprised
german
found
himself
sprawling
upon
the
sidewalk
and
saw
fidel
who
had
escaped
without
a
scratch
dashing
wildly
up
the
street
after
jan
and
marie
beside
himself
with
rage
the
soldier
drew
a
revolver
and
fired
a
shot
which
barely
missed
fidel
and
buried
itself
in
the
doorstep
of
the
house
past
which
he
was
running
if
jan
and
marie
had
not
turned
a
corner
just
at
that
moment
and
if
fidel
had
not
followed
them
there
is
no
telling
what
might
have
happened
next
for
the
young
soldier
was
very
angry
indeed
perhaps
he
considered
it
beneath
his
dignity
to
run
after
them
and
perhaps
he
saw
that
jan
and
marie
could
both
run
like
the
wind
and
he
would
not
be
likely
to
catch
them
if
he
did
at
any
rate
he
did
not
follow
he
picked
himself
up
and
dusted
his
clothes
using
very
bad
language
as
he
did
so
and
followed
the
officer
and
his
companions
up
the
street
meanwhile
the
tired
children
ran
on
and
on
fear
lending
speed
to
their
weary
legs
round
behind
the
great
cathedral
they
sped
hoping
to
find
some
way
of
escape
from
the
terrors
of
the
town
but
their
way
was
blocked
by
the
smoking
ruins
of
a
section
of
the
city
which
the
germans
had
burned
in
the
night
and
there
was
no
way
to
get
out
in
that
direction
terrified
and
faint
with
hunger
they
turned
once
more
and
not
knowing
where
they
were
going
stumbled
at
last
upon
the
street
which
led
to
the
antwerp
gate
i
remember
this
place
cried
jan
with
something
like
joy
in
his
voice
do
you
remember
marie
it
where
we
stood
to
watch
the
soldiers
and
mother
sang
for
us
to
march
because
we
were
so
tired
and
hungry
i
tired
and
hungry
now
too
said
poor
marie
let
march
again
said
where
to
said
marie
that
the
way
father
went
when
he
marched
away
with
the
soldiers
said
jan
pointing
to
the
antwerp
gate
anything
is
better
than
staying
here
let
go
that
way
he
started
bravely
forward
once
more
marie
and
fidel
following
they
found
themselves
only
two
wretched
atoms
in
one
of
the
saddest
processions
in
history
for
there
were
many
other
people
as
unhappy
as
themselves
who
were
also
trying
to
escape
from
the
city
some
had
lived
in
the
section
which
was
now
burning
others
had
been
turned
out
of
their
homes
by
the
germans
and
all
were
hastening
along
carrying
babies
and
bundles
and
followed
by
groups
of
older
children
jan
and
marie
were
swept
along
with
the
hurrying
crowd
through
the
city
gate
and
beyond
along
the
river
road
which
led
to
antwerp
no
one
spoke
to
them
doubtless
they
were
supposed
to
belong
to
some
one
of
the
fleeing
families
and
it
was
at
least
comforting
to
the
children
to
be
near
people
of
whom
they
were
not
afraid
but
jan
and
marie
could
not
keep
pace
with
the
crowd
of
refugees
they
trudged
along
the
highway
at
their
best
speed
only
to
find
themselves
straggling
farther
and
farther
behind
they
were
half
a
mile
or
more
beyond
the
city
gate
when
they
overtook
a
queer
little
old
woman
who
was
plodding
steadily
along
wheeling
a
wheelbarrow
in
front
of
her
she
evidently
did
not
belong
among
the
refugees
for
she
was
making
no
effort
to
keep
up
with
them
she
had
bright
twinkling
black
eyes
and
hair
tucked
under
a
cap
her
face
was
as
brown
as
a
nut
and
full
of
wrinkles
but
it
shone
with
such
kindness
and
that
when
jan
and
marie
had
taken
one
look
at
her
they
could
not
help
walking
along
by
her
side
maybe
she
has
seen
mother
whispered
marie
to
let
ask
her
the
little
old
woman
smiled
down
at
them
as
they
joined
her
have
to
hurry
my
dears
or
you
wo
keep
up
with
your
folks
she
said
kindly
they
are
our
folks
said
they
are
said
the
little
old
woman
stopping
short
then
where
are
your
folks
we
have
any
not
just
now
said
you
see
our
father
is
a
soldier
and
our
mother
oh
have
you
seen
our
mother
she
lost
the
little
old
woman
gave
them
a
quick
pitying
glance
lost
is
she
she
said
well
now
i
ca
just
be
sure
whether
i
seen
her
or
not
not
knowing
what
she
looks
like
but
i
would
say
i
have
lots
of
folks
have
passed
this
way
how
did
she
get
lost
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
barrow
and
drew
the
children
to
her
side
come
now
she
said
tell
granny
all
about
it
i
seen
more
trouble
than
any
one
you
ever
saw
in
all
your
life
before
and
i
not
a
mite
afraid
of
it
either
comforted
already
the
children
poured
forth
their
story
you
poor
little
lambs
she
cried
when
they
had
finished
and
you
have
had
a
bite
to
eat
since
yesterday
mercy
on
us
you
can
never
find
your
mother
on
an
empty
stomach
she
rose
from
the
wheelbarrow
as
she
spoke
and
trundled
it
swiftly
from
the
road
to
the
bank
of
the
river
a
short
distance
away
here
in
a
sheltered
nook
hidden
from
the
highway
by
a
group
of
willows
she
stopped
we
camp
right
here
and
i
get
you
a
dinner
fit
for
a
king
or
a
duke
at
the
very
least
she
said
cheerily
look
what
i
have
in
my
wheelbarrow
she
took
a
basket
from
the
top
of
it
as
she
spoke
fidel
was
already
looking
in
with
his
tail
standing
straight
out
behind
his
ears
pointed
forward
and
the
hairs
bristling
on
the
back
of
his
neck
there
on
some
clean
white
sand
in
the
bottom
of
the
wheelbarrow
wriggled
a
fine
fat
eel
now
i
know
why
i
did
sell
that
eel
cried
granny
there
always
a
reason
for
everything
you
see
my
darlings
she
seized
the
eel
with
a
firm
hand
as
she
spoke
and
before
could
spell
your
name
backwards
she
had
skinned
and
dressed
it
and
had
given
the
remnants
to
poor
hungry
fidel
now
my
boy
she
said
gayly
to
jan
as
she
worked
you
get
together
some
twigs
and
dead
leaves
and
you
big
eyes
she
added
to
marie
find
some
stones
by
the
river
and
we
soon
have
such
a
stove
as
you
never
saw
before
and
a
fire
in
it
and
a
bit
of
fried
eel
to
fill
your
hungry
stomachs
immensely
cheered
the
children
flew
on
these
errands
then
marie
had
a
bright
thought
we
have
some
potatoes
in
our
bundle
she
said
well
now
cried
the
little
old
woman
would
you
think
they
had
just
followed
up
that
eel
on
purpose
we
put
them
to
roast
in
the
ashes
i
always
carry
a
pan
and
a
bit
of
fat
and
some
matches
about
with
me
when
i
take
my
eels
to
market
she
explained
as
she
whisked
these
things
out
of
the
basket
and
it
often
happens
that
i
cook
myself
a
bite
to
eat
on
my
way
home
especially
if
i
late
you
see
i
live
a
long
way
from
here
just
across
the
river
from
boom
and
getting
lazy
in
my
old
age
early
every
morning
i
walk
to
malines
with
my
barrow
full
of
fine
eels
and
sell
them
to
the
people
of
the
town
that
how
i
happen
to
be
so
rich
are
you
rich
asked
marie
wonderingly
she
had
brought
the
stones
from
the
river
and
now
she
untied
her
bundle
and
took
out
the
potatoes
jan
had
already
heaped
a
little
mound
of
sticks
and
twigs
near
by
and
soon
the
potatoes
were
cooking
in
the
ashes
and
a
most
appetizing
smell
of
frying
eel
filled
the
air
am
i
rich
repeated
the
old
woman
she
looked
surprised
that
any
one
could
ask
such
a
question
of
course
i
rich
have
i
got
two
eyes
in
my
head
and
a
tongue
too
and
it
lucky
indeed
that
it
that
way
about
for
if
i
had
but
one
eye
and
two
tongues
you
see
for
yourself
how
much
less
handy
that
would
be
and
i
two
legs
as
good
as
any
one
and
two
hands
to
help
myself
with
the
kaiser
himself
has
no
more
legs
and
arms
than
i
and
i
doubt
if
he
can
use
them
half
as
well
neither
has
he
a
stomach
the
more
and
as
for
his
heart
she
looked
cautiously
around
as
she
spoke
his
heart
i
be
bound
is
not
half
so
good
as
mine
if
it
were
he
could
not
find
it
in
it
to
do
all
the
cruel
things
he
doing
here
i
sure
of
that
for
a
moment
the
cheerfulness
of
her
face
clouded
over
but
she
saw
the
shadow
reflected
in
the
faces
of
jan
and
marie
and
at
once
spoke
more
gayly
bless
you
yes
i
rich
she
went
on
and
so
are
you
got
all
the
things
that
i
have
and
more
too
for
you
legs
and
arms
are
young
and
you
have
a
mother
to
look
for
not
every
one
has
that
you
may
depend
and
one
of
these
days
you
find
her
make
no
doubt
of
that
if
we
do
she
surely
find
us
anyway
said
she
said
she
would
indeed
and
she
will
said
the
old
woman
even
the
germans
stop
her
so
what
matter
is
it
if
you
both
have
to
look
a
bit
first
it
will
only
make
it
the
better
when
you
find
each
other
again
when
the
potatoes
were
done
the
little
old
woman
raked
them
out
of
the
ashes
with
a
stick
broke
them
open
sprinkled
a
bit
of
salt
on
them
from
the
wonderful
basket
and
then
handed
one
to
each
of
the
children
wrapped
in
a
plantain
leaf
so
they
should
not
burn
their
fingers
a
piece
of
the
eel
was
served
to
them
in
the
same
way
and
granny
beamed
with
satisfaction
as
she
watched
her
famished
guests
are
you
going
to
eat
too
asked
marie
with
her
mouth
full
bless
you
yes
said
granny
every
chance
i
get
you
just
watch
me
she
made
a
great
show
of
taking
a
piece
of
the
eel
as
she
spoke
but
if
any
one
had
been
watching
carefully
they
would
have
her
slyly
put
it
back
again
into
the
pan
and
the
children
never
knew
that
they
ate
her
share
and
their
own
too
when
they
had
eaten
every
scrap
of
the
eel
and
fidel
had
finished
the
bones
the
little
old
woman
rose
briskly
from
the
bank
washed
her
pan
in
the
river
packed
it
in
her
basket
again
and
led
the
way
up
the
path
to
the
highway
once
more
although
they
found
the
road
still
filled
with
the
flying
refugees
the
world
had
grown
suddenly
brighter
to
jan
and
marie
they
had
found
a
friend
and
they
were
fed
now
you
come
along
home
with
your
granny
said
the
little
old
woman
as
they
reached
the
antwerp
road
and
turned
northward
for
i
live
in
a
little
house
by
the
river
right
on
the
way
to
wherever
you
want
to
go
ix
off
for
antwerp
for
several
days
the
children
stayed
with
the
little
old
woman
in
her
tiny
cottage
on
the
edge
of
the
river
each
morning
they
crossed
the
bridge
and
stationed
themselves
by
the
antwerp
road
to
watch
the
swarm
of
belgians
as
they
hurried
through
boom
on
their
way
to
the
frontier
and
to
safety
in
holland
each
day
they
hoped
that
before
the
sun
went
down
they
should
see
their
mother
among
the
hurrying
multitudes
but
each
day
brought
a
fresh
disappointment
and
each
night
the
little
old
woman
comforted
them
with
fresh
hope
for
the
morrow
you
see
my
darlings
said
she
it
may
take
a
long
time
and
you
may
have
to
go
a
long
way
first
but
i
feel
in
my
bones
that
you
will
find
her
at
last
and
of
course
if
you
do
every
step
you
take
is
a
step
toward
her
no
matter
how
far
round
you
go
jan
and
marie
believed
every
word
that
granny
said
how
could
they
help
it
when
she
had
been
so
good
to
them
her
courage
and
faith
seemed
to
make
an
isle
of
safety
about
her
where
the
children
rested
in
perfect
trust
they
saw
that
neither
guns
nor
germans
nor
any
other
terror
could
frighten
granny
in
the
midst
of
a
thousand
alarms
she
calmly
went
her
accustomed
way
and
every
one
who
met
her
was
the
better
for
a
glimpse
of
the
brave
little
brown
face
under
its
snowy
cap
early
each
morning
she
rose
with
the
larks
covered
the
bottom
of
her
barrow
with
clean
white
sand
and
placed
in
it
the
live
eels
which
had
been
caught
for
her
and
brought
to
the
door
by
small
boys
who
lived
in
the
neighborhood
then
when
she
had
wakened
the
twins
and
the
three
had
had
their
breakfast
together
away
she
would
trudge
over
the
long
dusty
road
to
malines
wheeling
the
barrow
with
its
squirming
freight
in
front
of
her
jan
and
marie
helped
her
all
they
could
they
washed
the
dishes
and
swept
the
floor
of
the
tiny
cottage
and
made
everything
tidy
and
clean
before
they
went
to
take
up
their
stand
beside
the
antwerp
road
when
the
shadows
grew
long
in
the
afternoon
how
glad
they
were
to
see
the
sturdy
little
figure
come
trudging
home
again
then
they
would
run
to
meet
her
and
jan
would
take
the
wheelbarrow
from
her
tired
hands
and
wheel
it
for
her
over
the
bridge
to
the
little
cottage
under
the
willow
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
then
marie
work
was
to
clean
the
barrow
while
jan
pulled
weeds
in
the
tiny
garden
back
of
the
house
and
granny
got
supper
ready
was
the
best
of
all
for
every
pleasant
evening
they
ate
at
a
little
table
out
of
doors
under
the
willow
trees
one
evening
when
supper
had
been
cleared
away
they
sat
there
together
with
fidel
beside
them
while
granny
told
a
wonderful
tale
about
the
king
of
the
eels
who
lived
in
a
crystal
palace
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
you
ca
quite
see
the
palace
she
said
because
when
you
look
right
down
into
it
the
water
seems
muddy
but
sometimes
when
it
is
still
you
can
see
the
country
where
the
king
of
the
eels
lives
there
the
trees
all
grow
with
their
heads
down
and
the
sky
is
below
the
trees
you
see
the
sky
might
as
well
be
down
as
up
for
the
eels
they
are
like
us
just
obliged
to
crawl
around
on
the
ground
without
ever
being
able
to
go
up
or
down
at
all
the
sky
belongs
to
the
birds
and
the
sky
belongs
to
the
fishes
and
eels
and
i
am
not
sure
but
one
is
just
as
nice
as
the
other
marie
and
jan
went
to
the
river
and
getting
down
on
their
hands
and
knees
looked
into
the
water
we
ca
see
a
thing
they
cried
to
granny
you
are
looking
the
right
way
she
answered
look
across
it
toward
the
sunset
oh
oh
cried
marie
clasping
her
hands
i
see
it
i
see
the
sky
and
it
is
all
red
and
gold
i
told
you
so
replied
granny
triumphantly
lots
of
folks
ca
see
a
thing
in
the
river
but
the
mud
when
if
you
look
at
it
the
right
way
there
is
a
whole
lovely
world
in
it
now
the
palace
of
the
king
of
the
eels
is
right
over
in
that
direction
where
the
color
is
the
reddest
he
is
very
fond
of
red
is
the
king
of
the
eels
his
throne
is
all
made
of
rubies
and
he
makes
the
queen
tie
red
bows
on
the
tails
of
all
the
little
eels
jan
and
marie
were
still
looking
with
all
their
eyes
across
the
still
water
toward
the
sunset
and
trying
to
see
the
crystal
palace
of
the
eels
when
suddenly
from
behind
them
there
came
a
loud
they
jumped
and
granny
jumped
too
and
they
all
looked
around
to
see
where
the
sound
came
from
there
coming
slowly
toward
them
along
the
on
the
was
an
old
brown
mule
she
was
pulling
a
low
green
by
a
towline
and
a
small
boy
not
much
bigger
than
jan
was
driving
her
on
the
deck
of
the
boat
there
was
a
little
cabin
with
white
curtains
in
the
tiny
windows
and
two
red
geraniums
in
pots
standing
on
the
sills
from
a
clothesline
hitched
to
the
rigging
there
fluttered
a
row
of
little
shirts
and
seated
on
a
box
near
by
there
was
a
fat
friendly
looking
woman
with
two
small
children
playing
by
her
side
the
father
of
the
family
was
busy
with
the
tiller
there
come
the
de
smets
as
sure
as
you
live
cried
granny
rising
from
the
wheelbarrow
where
she
had
been
sitting
i
certainly
am
glad
to
see
them
and
she
started
at
once
down
the
river
to
meet
the
boat
with
jan
and
marie
and
fidel
all
following
ship
ahoy
she
cried
gayly
as
the
boat
drew
near
the
boy
who
was
driving
the
mule
grinned
shyly
the
woman
on
deck
lifted
her
eyes
from
her
sewing
smiled
and
waved
her
hand
at
granny
while
the
two
little
children
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
boat
and
held
out
their
arms
to
her
here
we
are
again
war
or
no
war
cried
mother
de
smet
as
the
boat
came
alongside
father
de
smet
left
the
tiller
and
threw
a
rope
ashore
whoa
cried
the
boy
driving
the
mule
the
mule
stopped
with
the
greatest
willingness
the
boy
caught
the
rope
and
lifted
the
great
loop
over
a
strong
post
on
the
and
the
old
woman
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
boat
was
in
port
soon
a
gangplank
was
slipped
from
the
boat
to
the
little
wooden
steps
on
the
bank
and
mother
de
smet
with
a
squirming
baby
under
each
arm
came
ashore
i
do
like
to
get
out
on
dry
land
and
shake
my
legs
a
bit
now
and
then
she
said
cheerfully
as
she
greeted
granny
on
the
boat
i
just
sit
still
and
grow
fat
i
shake
my
legs
for
a
matter
of
ten
miles
every
day
laughed
granny
that
how
i
keep
my
figure
mother
de
smet
set
the
babies
down
on
the
grass
where
they
immediately
began
to
tumble
about
like
a
pair
of
puppies
and
she
and
granny
talked
together
while
the
twins
went
to
watch
the
work
of
father
de
smet
and
the
boy
whose
name
was
joseph
i
do
know
whatever
the
country
is
coming
to
said
mother
de
smet
to
granny
the
germans
are
everywhere
and
they
are
taking
everything
that
they
can
lay
their
hands
on
i
doubt
if
we
ever
get
our
cargo
safe
to
antwerp
this
time
we
come
for
a
load
of
potatoes
but
i
am
very
much
afraid
it
is
going
to
be
our
last
trip
for
some
time
the
country
looks
quiet
enough
as
you
see
it
from
the
boat
but
the
things
that
are
happening
in
it
would
chill
your
blood
yes
sighed
granny
if
i
would
let
it
my
old
heart
would
break
over
the
sights
that
i
see
every
day
on
my
way
to
malines
but
a
broken
heart
wo
get
you
anywhere
maybe
a
stout
heart
will
who
are
the
children
you
have
with
you
asked
mother
de
smet
then
granny
told
her
how
she
had
found
jan
and
marie
and
all
the
rest
of
the
sad
story
mother
de
smet
wiped
her
eyes
and
blew
her
nose
very
hard
as
she
listened
i
would
let
them
wait
any
longer
by
the
antwerp
road
anyway
she
said
when
granny
had
finished
there
is
no
use
in
the
world
in
looking
for
their
mother
to
come
that
way
she
was
probably
driven
over
the
border
long
ago
you
just
leave
them
with
me
while
you
go
to
town
cheer
them
up
a
bit
to
play
with
joseph
and
the
babies
well
now
said
granny
if
that
is
just
like
your
good
heart
and
that
is
how
it
happened
that
when
she
trudged
off
with
her
barrow
the
next
morning
the
twins
ran
down
to
the
boat
and
spent
the
day
rolling
on
the
grass
with
the
babies
and
helping
father
de
smet
and
joseph
to
load
the
boat
with
bags
of
potatoes
which
had
been
brought
to
the
dock
in
the
night
by
neighboring
farmers
when
granny
came
trundling
her
barrow
home
in
the
late
afternoon
she
found
the
children
and
their
new
friends
already
on
the
best
of
terms
and
that
night
after
the
twins
were
in
bed
she
went
aboard
the
old
woman
and
talked
for
a
long
time
with
father
and
mother
de
smet
no
one
will
ever
know
just
what
they
said
to
each
other
but
it
must
be
that
they
talked
about
the
twins
for
when
the
children
awoke
the
next
morning
they
found
granny
standing
beside
their
bed
with
their
clothes
all
nicely
washed
and
ironed
in
her
hands
i
not
going
to
town
this
morning
with
my
eels
she
said
as
she
popped
them
out
of
bed
i
going
to
stay
at
home
and
see
you
off
on
your
journey
she
did
not
tell
them
that
things
had
grown
so
terrible
in
malines
that
even
she
felt
it
wise
to
stay
away
our
journey
cried
the
twins
in
astonishment
what
journey
to
antwerp
cried
granny
now
you
never
thought
a
chance
like
that
would
come
to
you
i
sure
but
some
people
are
born
lucky
you
see
the
de
smets
start
back
today
and
they
are
willing
to
take
you
along
with
them
but
we
do
want
to
leave
you
dear
dear
granny
cried
the
twins
throwing
their
arms
about
her
neck
and
i
do
want
you
to
go
either
my
lambs
said
granny
but
you
see
there
are
lots
of
things
to
think
of
in
the
first
place
of
course
you
want
to
go
on
hunting
for
your
mother
it
may
be
she
has
gone
over
the
border
for
the
germans
are
already
in
trenches
near
antwerp
and
our
army
is
nearer
still
to
antwerp
and
in
trenches
too
there
they
stay
father
de
smet
says
for
all
the
world
like
two
tigers
lying
ready
to
spring
at
each
other
throats
he
says
antwerp
is
so
strongly
fortified
that
the
germans
can
never
take
it
and
so
it
is
a
better
place
to
be
in
than
here
the
de
smets
will
see
that
you
are
left
in
safe
hands
and
i
sure
your
mother
would
want
you
to
go
the
children
considered
this
for
a
moment
in
silence
at
last
jan
said
do
you
think
father
de
smet
would
let
me
help
drive
the
mule
i
have
a
doubt
of
it
said
granny
but
what
about
fidel
our
dear
fidel
cried
marie
i
tell
you
what
i
do
said
granny
i
take
care
of
fidel
for
you
you
shall
leave
him
here
with
me
until
you
come
back
again
you
see
i
really
need
good
company
and
since
i
ca
have
you
i
know
you
would
be
glad
to
have
fidel
stay
here
to
protect
me
then
you
always
know
just
where
he
is
she
hurried
the
children
into
their
clothes
as
she
talked
gave
them
a
good
breakfast
and
before
they
had
time
to
think
much
about
what
was
happening
to
them
they
had
said
to
fidel
who
had
to
be
shut
in
the
cottage
to
keep
him
from
following
the
boat
and
were
safely
aboard
the
old
woman
and
slowly
moving
away
down
the
river
they
stood
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
listening
to
fidel
wild
barks
and
waving
their
hands
until
granny
kind
face
was
a
mere
round
speck
in
the
distance
x
on
the
when
they
could
no
longer
see
granny
nor
hear
fidel
the
children
sat
down
on
a
coil
of
rope
behind
the
cabin
and
felt
very
miserable
indeed
marie
was
just
turning
up
the
corner
of
her
apron
to
wipe
her
eyes
and
jan
was
looking
at
nothing
at
all
and
winking
very
hard
when
good
mother
de
smet
came
by
with
a
baby
waddling
along
on
each
side
of
her
she
gave
the
two
dismal
little
faces
a
quick
glance
and
then
said
kindly
jan
you
run
and
see
if
you
ca
help
father
with
the
tiller
and
marie
would
you
mind
playing
with
the
babies
while
i
put
on
the
and
fix
the
greens
for
dinner
they
are
beginning
to
climb
everywhere
now
and
i
am
afraid
they
will
fall
overboard
if
somebody
does
watch
them
every
minute
jan
clattered
at
once
across
the
deck
to
father
de
smet
and
marie
gladly
followed
his
wife
to
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
cabin
where
the
babies
had
room
to
roll
about
half
an
hour
later
when
mother
de
smet
went
back
to
get
some
potatoes
for
the
soup
she
found
jan
proudly
steering
the
boat
by
himself
oh
my
soul
she
cried
in
astonishment
what
a
clever
boy
you
must
be
to
learn
so
quickly
to
handle
the
tiller
where
is
father
de
smet
here
boomed
a
loud
voice
behind
her
and
father
de
smet
head
appeared
above
a
barrel
on
the
other
side
of
the
deck
i
trying
to
make
the
woman
look
as
if
she
had
no
cargo
aboard
if
the
germans
see
these
potatoes
they
never
let
us
get
them
to
antwerp
he
shouted
you
must
talk
so
loud
whispered
mother
de
smet
you
roar
like
a
foghorn
on
a
dark
night
the
germans
wo
have
any
trouble
in
finding
out
about
the
potatoes
if
you
shout
the
news
all
over
the
landscape
father
de
smet
looked
out
over
the
quiet
belgian
fields
there
nobody
about
that
i
can
see
he
said
but
i
roar
more
gently
next
time
there
was
a
bend
in
the
river
just
at
this
point
and
jan
looking
fearfully
about
to
see
if
he
could
see
any
germans
for
an
instant
forgot
all
about
the
tiller
there
was
a
jerk
on
the
and
a
bump
as
the
nose
of
the
old
woman
ran
into
the
netteke
the
mule
came
to
a
sudden
stop
and
mother
de
smet
sat
down
equally
suddenly
on
a
coil
of
rope
her
potatoes
spilled
over
the
deck
while
a
wail
from
the
front
of
the
boat
announced
that
one
of
the
babies
had
bumped
too
mother
de
smet
picked
herself
up
and
ran
to
see
what
was
the
matter
with
the
baby
while
father
de
smet
seized
a
long
pole
and
hurried
forward
joseph
left
the
mule
to
browse
upon
the
grass
beside
the
and
ran
back
to
the
boat
his
father
threw
him
a
pole
which
was
kept
for
such
emergencies
and
they
both
pushed
joseph
pushed
on
the
boat
and
his
father
pushed
against
the
meanwhile
poor
jan
stood
wretchedly
by
the
tiller
knowing
that
his
carelessness
had
caused
the
trouble
yet
not
knowing
what
to
do
to
help
never
mind
son
said
mother
de
smet
kindly
when
she
came
back
for
her
potatoes
and
saw
his
downcast
face
it
is
the
first
time
the
woman
has
stuck
her
nose
in
the
mud
and
with
older
people
than
you
at
the
tiller
too
we
soon
have
her
off
again
and
no
harm
done
the
boat
gave
a
little
lurch
toward
the
middle
of
the
stream
look
alive
there
mate
sang
out
father
de
smet
hard
aport
with
the
tiller
head
her
out
into
the
stream
joseph
flung
his
pole
to
his
father
and
rushed
back
to
netteke
pulled
her
patient
nose
out
of
a
delicious
bunch
of
thistles
and
started
her
up
the
jan
sprang
to
the
tiller
and
soon
the
old
woman
was
once
more
gliding
smoothly
over
the
quiet
water
toward
antwerp
when
father
de
smet
came
back
to
the
stern
of
the
boat
jan
expected
a
scolding
but
perhaps
it
seemed
to
the
skipper
that
jan
had
troubles
enough
already
for
he
only
said
mildly
stick
to
your
job
son
whatever
it
is
and
went
on
covering
his
potatoes
with
empty
boxes
and
pieces
of
sailcloth
jan
paid
such
strict
attention
to
the
tiller
after
that
that
he
did
not
even
forget
when
father
de
smet
pointed
out
a
burning
farmhouse
a
mile
or
so
from
the
river
and
said
grimly
the
germans
are
amusing
themselves
again
for
the
most
part
however
the
countryside
seemed
so
quiet
and
peaceful
that
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
such
dreadful
things
were
going
on
all
about
them
while
father
de
smet
eyes
under
their
bushy
brows
kept
close
watch
in
every
direction
he
said
little
about
his
fears
and
went
on
his
way
exactly
as
he
had
done
before
the
invasion
it
was
quite
early
in
the
morning
when
they
left
boom
and
by
ten
joseph
was
tired
of
trudging
along
beside
netteke
he
hailed
his
father
may
i
come
aboard
now
he
shouted
father
de
smet
looked
at
would
you
like
to
drive
the
mule
awhile
he
asked
oh
would
i
cried
have
you
ever
driven
a
mule
before
father
de
smet
asked
again
not
a
mule
exactly
jail
replied
but
i
drove
old
pier
up
from
the
field
with
a
load
of
wheat
all
by
myself
mother
sat
on
the
load
come
along
shouted
father
de
smet
to
joseph
and
in
a
moment
the
gangplank
was
out
and
jan
and
joseph
had
changed
places
may
i
go
too
asked
marie
timidly
of
father
de
smet
as
he
was
about
to
draw
in
the
plank
the
babies
are
both
asleep
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
father
de
smet
took
a
careful
look
in
every
direction
it
was
level
open
country
all
about
them
dotted
here
and
there
with
farmhouses
and
in
the
distance
the
spire
of
a
village
church
rose
above
the
clustering
houses
and
pointed
to
the
sky
yes
yes
child
go
ahead
said
father
de
smet
only
do
get
too
near
netteke
hind
legs
she
does
know
you
very
well
and
sometimes
she
forgets
her
manners
marie
skipped
over
the
gangplank
and
ran
along
the
to
jan
who
already
had
taken
up
netteke
reins
and
was
waiting
for
the
signal
to
start
joseph
took
his
place
at
the
tiller
and
again
the
old
woman
moved
slowly
down
the
stream
for
some
time
jan
and
marie
plodded
along
with
netteke
at
first
they
thought
it
good
fun
but
by
and
by
as
the
sun
grew
hot
driving
a
mule
on
a
did
not
seem
quite
so
pleasant
a
task
as
they
had
thought
it
would
be
i
tired
of
this
said
jan
at
last
to
marie
that
mule
is
so
slow
that
i
have
to
sight
her
by
something
to
be
sure
that
she
is
moving
at
all
i
been
measuring
by
that
farmhouse
across
the
river
for
a
long
time
and
she
has
crawled
up
to
it
yet
i
should
wonder
if
go
to
sleep
some
day
and
fall
into
the
river
and
never
wake
up
why
i
am
almost
asleep
myself
she
wake
up
fast
enough
when
it
time
to
eat
and
so
will
you
said
marie
with
profound
wisdom
let
see
if
we
ca
make
her
go
a
little
faster
anyway
said
jan
ignoring
marie
remark
i
know
what
i
do
he
went
on
chuckling
i
get
some
burrs
and
stick
them
in
her
tail
and
then
every
time
she
slaps
the
flies
off
she
make
herself
go
faster
marie
seized
jan
arm
you
do
nothing
of
the
kind
she
cried
father
de
smet
told
me
especially
to
keep
away
from
netteke
hind
legs
pooh
said
jan
he
did
tell
me
that
i
not
afraid
of
any
mule
alive
i
guess
if
i
can
harness
a
horse
and
drive
home
a
load
of
grain
from
the
field
there
is
much
i
ca
do
with
a
mule
to
prove
his
words
he
shouted
u
u
at
netteke
and
slapped
her
flank
with
a
long
branch
of
willow
now
netteke
was
a
proud
mule
and
she
was
used
to
being
slapped
father
de
smet
knew
her
ways
and
knew
also
that
her
steady
even
slow
pace
was
better
in
the
long
run
than
to
attempt
to
force
a
livelier
gait
and
netteke
was
well
aware
of
what
was
expected
of
her
she
resented
being
interfered
with
instead
of
going
forward
at
greater
speed
she
put
her
four
feet
together
laid
back
her
ears
gave
a
loud
and
stopped
u
u
shouted
jan
in
vain
netteke
would
not
move
marie
held
a
handful
of
fresh
grass
just
out
of
reach
of
her
mouth
but
netteke
was
really
offended
she
made
no
effort
to
get
it
she
simply
stayed
where
she
was
father
de
smet
stuck
his
head
over
the
side
of
the
boat
what
is
the
matter
he
shouted
oh
dear
said
jan
to
marie
i
hoped
he
would
notice
that
the
boat
was
moving
netteke
has
stopped
she
wo
go
at
all
i
think
she
run
down
marie
called
back
try
coaxing
her
cried
the
skipper
give
her
something
to
eat
hold
it
in
front
of
her
nose
i
have
answered
marie
but
she
wo
even
look
at
it
then
it
no
use
said
father
de
smet
mournfully
she
balked
and
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
we
just
have
to
wait
until
she
is
ready
to
go
again
when
she
has
made
up
her
mind
she
is
as
difficult
to
persuade
as
a
setting
hen
mother
de
smet
head
appeared
beside
her
husband
over
the
oh
dear
said
she
i
hoped
we
should
get
to
the
other
side
of
the
line
before
dark
but
if
netteke
set
she
set
and
we
must
just
make
the
best
of
it
it
lucky
it
we
eat
and
maybe
by
the
time
we
are
through
she
be
willing
to
start
father
de
smet
tossed
a
bucket
on
to
the
grass
give
her
a
good
drink
he
said
and
come
aboard
yourselves
jan
filled
the
bucket
from
the
river
and
set
it
down
before
netteke
but
she
was
in
no
mood
for
blandishments
she
kept
her
ears
back
and
would
not
touch
the
water
all
right
then
crosspatch
said
leaving
the
pail
in
front
of
her
he
went
back
to
the
boat
the
gangplank
was
put
out
and
he
and
marie
went
on
board
they
found
dinner
ready
in
the
tiny
cabin
and
because
it
was
so
small
and
stuffy
and
there
were
too
many
of
them
anyway
to
get
into
it
comfortably
they
each
took
a
bowl
of
soup
as
mother
de
smet
handed
it
to
them
and
sat
down
on
the
deck
in
front
of
the
cabin
to
eat
it
it
was
not
until
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
that
netteke
forgot
her
injuries
consented
to
eat
and
drink
and
indicated
her
willingness
to
move
on
toward
antwerp
xi
the
attack
joseph
and
his
father
were
both
on
the
when
at
last
netteke
decided
to
move
as
she
set
her
ears
forward
and
took
the
first
step
father
de
smet
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
now
why
could
you
have
done
that
long
ago
you
addlepated
old
fool
he
said
mildly
to
netteke
you
have
made
no
end
of
trouble
for
us
and
gained
nothing
for
yourself
now
i
am
afraid
we
sha
get
beyond
the
german
lines
before
dark
we
may
even
have
to
spend
the
night
in
dangerous
territory
and
all
because
you
just
as
mulish
as
as
a
mule
he
finished
helplessly
joseph
laughed
ca
you
think
of
anything
mulisher
than
a
mule
he
said
there
is
a
thing
answered
his
father
well
answered
joseph
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
other
things
beside
balky
mules
in
this
world
that
i
wish
had
never
been
made
there
are
spiders
and
rats
and
germans
they
are
all
pests
i
do
see
why
they
were
ever
born
father
de
smet
became
serious
at
once
son
he
said
sternly
do
ever
let
me
hear
you
say
such
a
thing
again
there
are
spiders
and
rats
and
balky
mules
and
germans
and
it
does
do
a
bit
of
good
to
waste
words
fussing
because
they
are
here
the
thing
to
do
is
to
deal
with
them
father
de
smet
was
so
much
in
earnest
that
he
boomed
these
words
out
in
quite
a
loud
voice
joseph
seized
his
hand
hush
he
whispered
father
de
smet
looked
up
there
standing
right
in
front
of
them
in
the
was
a
german
soldier
halt
shouted
the
soldier
but
netteke
was
now
just
as
much
bent
upon
going
as
she
had
been
before
upon
standing
still
she
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
the
command
but
walked
stolidly
along
the
directly
toward
the
soldier
halt
cried
the
soldier
again
but
netteke
had
had
no
military
training
and
she
simply
kept
on
in
one
more
step
she
would
have
come
down
upon
the
soldier
toes
if
he
had
not
moved
aside
just
in
time
he
was
very
angry
why
did
you
stop
your
miserable
old
mule
when
i
told
you
to
he
said
to
father
de
smet
it
a
balky
mule
replied
father
de
smet
mildly
and
very
obstinate
indeed
sneered
the
soldier
then
i
suppose
you
have
named
him
albert
after
your
king
no
answered
father
de
smet
i
think
too
much
of
my
king
to
name
my
mule
after
him
oh
ho
said
the
german
then
perhaps
you
have
named
him
for
the
kaiser
netteke
had
marched
steadily
along
during
this
conversation
and
they
were
now
past
the
soldier
no
father
de
smet
called
back
i
did
name
her
after
the
kaiser
i
think
too
much
of
my
mule
the
soldier
shook
his
fist
after
them
i
make
you
pay
well
for
your
impudence
he
shouted
you
and
i
will
meet
again
very
likely
muttered
father
de
smet
under
his
breath
he
was
now
more
than
ever
anxious
to
get
beyond
the
german
lines
before
dark
but
as
the
afternoon
passed
it
became
certain
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
do
it
the
shadows
grew
longer
and
longer
as
netteke
plodded
slowly
along
and
at
last
mother
de
smet
called
to
her
husband
over
the
boatside
i
think
we
shall
have
to
stop
soon
and
feed
the
mule
or
she
will
be
too
tired
to
get
us
across
the
line
at
all
i
believe
we
should
save
time
by
stopping
for
supper
besides
i
want
to
send
over
there
she
pointed
to
a
farmhouse
not
a
great
distance
from
the
river
and
get
some
milk
and
eggs
very
well
said
her
husband
we
stop
under
that
bunch
of
willows
the
bunch
of
willows
beside
the
river
which
he
pointed
out
proved
to
be
a
pleasant
sheltered
spot
with
grassy
banks
sloping
down
to
the
water
a
turn
in
the
river
enabled
them
to
draw
the
old
woman
up
into
their
shadows
and
because
the
trees
were
green
and
the
boat
was
green
the
reflections
in
the
water
were
also
green
and
for
this
reason
the
boat
seemed
very
well
hidden
from
view
i
do
believe
we
shall
be
noticed
here
said
father
de
smet
it
hot
on
the
boat
it
would
be
nice
to
take
the
babies
ashore
while
we
eat
said
mother
de
smet
running
out
the
gangplank
i
believe
we
have
supper
on
the
grass
you
hurry
along
and
get
the
milk
and
eggs
and
i
cook
some
onions
while
you
are
gone
jan
and
marie
ran
over
the
plank
at
once
and
mother
de
smet
soon
followed
with
the
babies
then
while
marie
watched
them
she
and
jan
brought
out
the
onions
and
a
pan
and
soon
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
smell
of
frying
onions
joseph
and
jan
slipped
the
bridle
over
netteke
collar
and
allowed
her
to
eat
the
rich
green
grass
at
the
river
edge
when
father
de
smet
returned
supper
was
nearly
ready
he
sniffed
appreciatively
as
he
appeared
under
the
trees
smells
good
he
said
as
he
held
out
the
milk
and
eggs
toward
his
wife
sie
haben
recht
you
are
right
said
a
loud
voice
right
behind
him
father
de
smet
was
so
startled
that
he
dropped
the
eggs
he
whirled
about
and
there
stood
the
german
soldier
who
had
told
netteke
to
halt
with
him
were
six
other
men
ha
i
told
you
we
should
meet
again
shouted
the
soldier
to
father
de
smet
and
it
was
certainly
thoughtful
of
you
to
provide
for
our
entertainment
comrades
fall
to
the
onions
were
still
cooking
over
a
little
blaze
of
twigs
aid
dry
leaves
but
mother
de
smet
was
no
longer
tending
them
the
instant
she
heard
the
gruff
voice
she
had
dropped
her
spoon
and
seizing
a
baby
under
each
arm
had
fled
up
the
gangplank
on
to
the
boat
marie
followed
at
top
speed
father
de
smet
faced
the
intruders
what
do
you
want
here
he
said
some
supper
first
said
the
soldier
gayly
helping
himself
to
some
onions
and
passing
the
pan
to
his
friends
then
perhaps
a
few
supplies
for
our
brave
army
there
is
no
hurry
after
supper
will
do
but
first
we
drink
a
health
to
the
kaiser
and
since
you
are
host
here
you
shall
propose
it
he
pointed
to
the
pail
of
milk
which
father
de
smet
still
held
now
he
shouted
lift
your
stein
and
say
der
kaiser
father
de
smet
looked
them
in
the
face
and
said
not
a
word
meanwhile
jan
and
joseph
to
mother
de
smet
great
alarm
had
not
followed
her
on
to
the
boat
instead
they
had
flown
to
netteke
who
was
partly
hidden
from
the
group
by
a
bunch
of
young
willows
near
the
edge
and
with
great
speed
and
presence
of
mind
had
slipped
her
bridle
over
her
head
and
gently
started
her
up
the
oh
murmured
joseph
suppose
she
should
balk
but
netteke
had
done
her
balking
for
the
day
and
having
been
refreshed
by
her
luncheon
of
green
grass
she
was
ready
to
move
on
the
river
had
now
quite
a
current
which
helped
them
and
while
the
soldiers
were
still
having
their
joke
with
father
de
smet
the
boat
moved
quietly
out
of
sight
as
she
felt
it
move
mother
de
smet
lifted
her
head
over
the
boat
rail
behind
which
she
and
the
children
were
hiding
and
raised
the
end
of
the
gangplank
so
that
it
would
make
no
noise
by
scraping
along
the
ground
she
was
beside
herself
with
anxiety
if
she
screamed
or
said
anything
to
the
boys
the
attention
of
the
soldiers
would
immediately
be
directed
toward
them
yet
if
they
should
by
any
miracle
succeed
in
getting
away
there
was
her
husband
left
alone
to
face
seven
enemies
she
wrung
her
hands
maybe
they
will
stop
to
eat
the
onions
she
groaned
to
herself
she
held
to
the
gangplank
and
murmured
prayers
to
all
the
saints
she
knew
while
jan
and
joseph
trotted
briskly
along
the
and
netteke
assisted
by
the
current
made
better
speed
than
she
had
at
any
time
during
the
day
meanwhile
his
captors
were
busy
with
father
de
smet
come
drink
to
the
kaiser
shouted
the
first
soldier
or
we
feed
you
to
the
fishes
we
want
our
supper
and
you
delay
us
still
father
de
smet
said
nothing
we
give
you
just
until
i
count
ten
said
the
soldier
pointing
his
gun
at
him
and
if
by
that
time
you
have
not
found
your
tongue
but
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
from
an
unexpected
quarter
a
shot
rang
out
it
struck
the
pail
of
milk
and
dashed
it
over
the
german
and
over
father
de
smet
too
another
shot
followed
and
the
right
arm
of
the
soldier
fell
helpless
to
his
side
one
of
his
companions
gave
a
howl
and
fell
to
the
ground
still
no
one
appeared
at
whom
the
germans
could
direct
their
fire
snipers
shouted
the
soldiers
instantly
lowering
their
guns
but
before
they
could
even
fire
in
the
direction
of
the
unseen
enemy
there
was
such
a
patter
of
bullets
about
them
that
they
turned
and
fled
father
de
smet
fled
too
he
leaped
over
the
and
tore
down
the
after
the
boat
as
he
overtook
it
mother
de
smet
ran
out
the
gang
plank
boys
shouted
father
de
smet
get
aboard
get
aboard
joseph
and
jan
instantly
stopped
the
mule
and
dropping
the
reins
raced
up
the
gangplank
almost
before
the
end
of
it
rested
safely
on
the
ground
father
de
smet
snatched
up
the
reins
on
went
the
boat
at
netteke
best
speed
which
seemed
no
better
than
a
pace
to
the
fleeing
family
sounds
of
the
skirmish
continued
to
reach
their
ears
even
when
they
had
gone
some
distance
down
the
river
and
it
was
not
until
twilight
had
deepened
into
dusk
and
they
were
hidden
in
its
shadows
that
they
dared
hope
the
danger
was
passed
it
was
after
ten
at
night
when
the
old
woman
at
last
approached
the
twinkling
lights
of
antwerp
and
they
knew
that
for
the
time
being
at
least
they
were
safe
they
wore
now
beyond
the
german
lines
in
country
still
held
by
the
belgians
here
in
a
suburb
of
the
city
father
de
smet
decided
to
dock
for
the
night
a
distant
clock
struck
eleven
as
the
hungry
but
thankful
family
gathered
upon
the
deck
of
the
old
woman
to
eat
a
meager
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
with
only
the
moon
to
light
their
repast
not
until
they
had
finished
did
father
de
smet
tell
them
all
that
had
happened
to
him
during
the
few
terrible
moments
when
he
was
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
they
overreached
themselves
he
said
they
meant
to
amuse
themselves
by
prolonging
my
misery
and
they
lingered
just
a
bit
too
long
he
turned
to
jan
and
joseph
you
were
brave
boys
if
you
had
not
started
the
boat
when
you
did
it
is
quite
likely
they
might
have
got
me
after
all
and
the
potatoes
too
i
am
proud
of
you
but
father
cried
joseph
who
could
have
fired
those
shots
we
did
see
a
soul
neither
did
i
answered
his
father
and
neither
did
the
germans
for
that
matter
there
was
no
one
in
sight
oh
cried
mother
de
smet
it
was
as
if
the
good
god
himself
intervened
to
save
you
as
i
figure
it
out
said
father
de
smet
we
must
have
stopped
very
near
the
trenches
and
our
own
men
must
have
seen
the
germans
attack
us
my
german
friend
had
evidently
been
following
us
up
meaning
to
get
everything
we
had
and
me
too
but
the
smell
of
the
onions
was
too
much
for
him
if
he
had
been
greedy
he
might
have
carried
out
his
plan
but
he
wanted
our
potatoes
and
our
supper
too
and
so
he
got
neither
he
chuckled
and
neither
did
the
kaiser
get
a
toast
from
me
instead
he
got
a
salute
from
the
belgians
he
crossed
himself
reverently
thank
god
for
our
soldiers
he
said
and
mother
de
smet
weeping
softly
murmured
a
devout
amen
little
did
jan
and
marie
dream
as
they
listened
that
this
blessing
rested
upon
their
own
father
and
that
he
had
been
one
of
the
belgian
soldiers
who
firing
from
the
trenches
had
delivered
them
from
the
hands
of
their
enemies
their
father
hidden
away
in
the
earth
like
a
fox
as
little
dreamed
that
he
had
helped
to
save
his
own
children
from
a
terrible
fate
xii
the
zeppelin
raid
when
the
twins
awoke
early
the
next
morning
they
found
that
father
and
mother
de
smet
had
been
stirring
much
earlier
still
and
that
the
old
woman
was
already
slipping
quietly
along
among
the
docks
of
antwerp
to
their
immense
surprise
they
were
being
towed
not
by
netteke
but
by
a
very
small
and
puffy
steam
tug
they
were
further
astonished
to
find
that
netteke
herself
was
on
board
the
old
woman
how
in
the
world
did
you
get
the
mule
on
to
the
boat
gasped
jan
when
he
saw
her
led
her
right
up
the
gangplank
just
like
folks
answered
father
de
smet
i
could
leave
her
behind
and
i
wanted
to
get
to
the
antwerp
docks
as
soon
as
possible
this
was
the
quickest
way
you
see
he
went
on
i
do
know
where
i
shall
be
going
next
but
i
know
it
wo
be
up
the
dyle
so
i
am
going
to
keep
netteke
right
where
i
can
use
her
any
minute
there
was
no
time
for
further
questions
for
father
de
smet
had
to
devote
his
attention
to
the
tiller
soon
they
were
safely
in
dock
and
father
de
smet
was
unloading
his
potatoes
and
selling
them
to
the
who
swarmed
about
the
boats
to
buy
the
produce
which
had
been
brought
in
from
the
country
there
he
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
as
he
delivered
the
last
of
his
cargo
to
a
purchaser
late
in
the
afternoon
that
load
is
safe
from
the
germans
anyway
how
did
you
find
things
up
the
dyle
asked
the
merchant
who
had
bought
the
potatoes
father
de
smet
shook
his
head
could
well
be
worse
he
said
i
not
going
to
risk
another
trip
the
germans
are
taking
everything
they
can
lay
their
hands
on
and
are
destroying
what
they
ca
seize
i
nearly
lost
this
load
and
my
life
into
the
bargain
if
it
had
been
that
without
knowing
it
we
stopped
so
near
the
belgian
line
of
trenches
that
they
could
fire
on
the
german
foragers
who
tried
to
take
our
cargo
i
should
have
been
here
to
tell
this
tale
god
only
knows
what
will
become
of
belgium
if
this
state
of
things
continues
groaned
the
merchant
food
must
come
from
somewhere
or
the
people
will
starve
true
enough
answered
father
de
smet
i
believe
i
try
a
trip
north
through
the
back
channels
of
the
scheldt
and
see
what
i
can
pick
up
do
give
up
anyway
urged
the
merchant
if
you
fellows
go
back
on
us
i
do
know
what
we
shall
do
we
depend
on
you
to
bring
supplies
from
somewhere
and
if
you
ca
get
them
in
belgium
you
have
to
go
up
into
holland
mother
de
smet
leaned
over
the
boatrail
and
spoke
to
the
two
men
who
were
standing
on
the
dock
you
better
believe
we
not
give
up
she
said
we
do
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
well
said
the
merchant
sadly
maybe
you
do
but
there
are
others
who
do
it
takes
a
stout
heart
to
have
faith
that
god
has
forgotten
belgium
these
days
it
easy
enough
to
have
faith
when
things
are
going
right
said
mother
de
smet
but
to
have
faith
when
things
are
going
wrong
is
so
easy
then
she
remembered
granny
but
a
sick
heart
wo
get
you
anywhere
and
maybe
a
stout
one
will
she
finished
that
a
good
word
said
the
merchant
it
was
said
by
as
good
a
woman
as
treads
answered
mother
de
smet
you
are
safe
while
you
stay
in
antwerp
anyway
said
the
merchant
as
he
turned
to
say
our
forts
are
the
strongest
in
the
world
and
the
germans
will
never
be
able
to
take
them
there
comfort
in
that
for
us
then
he
spoke
to
his
horses
and
turned
away
with
his
load
let
us
stay
right
here
said
mother
de
smet
to
her
husband
as
he
came
on
board
the
boat
we
are
all
in
need
of
rest
after
yesterday
and
in
antwerp
we
can
get
a
good
night
sleep
besides
it
is
so
late
in
the
day
that
we
could
get
out
of
town
before
dark
if
we
tried
following
this
plan
the
whole
family
went
to
bed
at
dusk
but
they
were
not
destined
to
enjoy
the
quiet
sleep
they
longed
for
the
night
was
warm
and
the
cabin
small
so
father
de
smet
and
joseph
as
well
as
the
twins
spread
bedding
on
the
deck
and
went
to
sleep
looking
up
at
the
stars
they
had
slept
for
some
hours
when
they
were
suddenly
aroused
by
the
sound
of
a
terrific
explosion
instantly
they
sprang
to
their
feet
wide
awake
and
mother
de
smet
came
rushing
from
the
cabin
with
the
babies
screaming
in
her
arms
what
is
it
now
what
is
it
she
cried
look
look
cried
jan
he
pointed
to
the
sky
there
blazing
with
light
like
a
great
misshapen
moon
was
a
giant
airship
moving
swiftly
over
the
city
as
it
sailed
along
streams
of
fire
fell
from
it
and
immediately
there
followed
the
terrible
thunder
of
bursting
bombs
when
it
passed
out
of
sight
it
seemed
as
if
the
voice
of
the
city
itself
must
rise
in
anguish
at
the
terrible
destruction
left
in
its
wake
just
what
that
destruction
was
father
de
smet
did
not
wish
to
see
this
is
a
good
place
to
get
away
from
he
said
to
the
frightened
group
cowering
on
the
deck
of
the
old
woman
after
the
bright
terror
had
disappeared
when
morning
came
he
lost
no
time
in
making
the
best
speed
he
could
away
from
the
doomed
city
of
antwerp
which
they
had
thought
so
safe
when
they
had
left
the
city
behind
them
and
the
boat
was
slowly
making
its
way
through
the
quiet
back
channels
of
the
scheldt
the
world
once
more
seemed
really
peaceful
to
the
wandering
children
their
way
lay
over
still
waters
and
beside
green
pastures
and
as
they
had
no
communication
with
the
stricken
regions
of
belgium
they
had
no
news
of
the
progress
of
the
war
until
some
days
later
the
boat
docked
at
rotterdam
and
it
became
necessary
to
decide
what
should
be
done
next
there
they
learned
that
they
had
barely
escaped
the
siege
of
antwerp
which
had
begun
with
the
zeppelin
raid
father
de
smet
was
now
obliged
to
confront
the
problem
of
what
to
do
with
his
own
family
for
since
antwerp
was
now
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
he
could
no
longer
earn
his
living
in
the
old
way
under
these
changed
conditions
he
could
not
take
care
of
jan
and
marie
so
one
sad
day
they
said
to
good
mother
de
smet
to
joseph
and
the
babies
and
went
with
father
de
smet
into
the
city
of
rotterdam
they
found
that
these
streets
were
also
full
of
belgian
refugees
and
here
too
they
watched
for
their
mother
in
order
to
keep
up
her
courage
marie
had
often
to
feel
of
the
locket
and
to
say
to
herself
she
will
find
us
she
will
find
us
and
jan
jan
had
many
times
to
say
to
himself
i
am
now
a
man
and
must
be
brave
or
he
would
have
cried
in
despair
but
help
was
nearer
than
they
supposed
already
england
had
begun
to
organize
for
the
relief
of
the
belgian
refugees
and
it
was
in
the
office
of
the
british
consul
at
rotterdam
that
father
de
smet
finally
took
leave
of
jan
and
marie
the
consul
took
them
that
night
to
his
own
home
and
after
a
careful
record
had
been
made
of
their
names
and
their
parents
names
and
all
the
facts
about
them
they
were
next
day
placed
upon
a
ship
in
company
with
many
other
homeless
belgians
and
sent
across
the
north
sea
to
england
xiii
refugees
if
i
were
to
tell
you
all
the
strange
new
sights
that
jan
and
marie
saw
and
all
the
things
they
did
in
england
it
would
make
this
book
so
big
you
could
not
hold
it
up
to
read
it
so
i
must
skip
all
about
the
great
house
in
the
southern
part
of
england
where
they
next
found
themselves
this
house
was
the
great
country
place
of
a
very
rich
man
and
when
the
war
broke
out
he
had
given
it
to
be
used
as
a
shelter
for
homeless
belgians
there
were
the
most
wonderful
woods
and
parks
on
the
estate
and
miles
of
beautiful
drives
there
were
great
gardens
and
stables
and
hothouses
and
the
house
was
much
bigger
and
finer
than
any
jan
and
marie
had
ever
seen
in
all
their
lives
it
seemed
to
them
as
if
they
had
suddenly
been
changed
into
a
prince
and
princess
by
some
fairy
wand
they
were
not
alone
in
all
this
splendor
other
lost
little
belgian
children
were
there
and
there
were
lost
parents
too
and
it
seemed
such
a
pity
that
the
lost
parents
and
the
lost
children
should
not
be
the
very
ones
that
belonged
together
so
that
every
one
could
be
happy
once
more
however
bad
as
it
was
it
was
so
much
better
than
anything
they
had
known
since
the
dreadful
first
night
of
the
alarm
that
jan
and
marie
became
almost
happy
again
at
night
they
and
the
other
homeless
children
slept
in
little
white
cots
set
all
in
a
row
in
a
great
picture
gallery
they
were
given
new
clothes
for
by
this
time
even
their
best
ones
were
quite
worn
out
and
every
day
they
had
plenty
of
good
plain
food
to
eat
every
day
more
belgians
came
and
still
more
until
not
only
the
big
house
but
the
stable
and
outbuildings
were
all
full
of
homeless
people
one
day
after
they
had
been
in
this
place
for
two
or
three
weeks
jan
and
marie
were
called
into
the
room
where
sat
the
lady
whose
home
they
were
in
it
was
like
an
office
and
there
were
several
other
persons
there
with
her
the
lady
spoke
to
them
jan
and
marie
she
said
how
would
you
like
to
go
to
live
with
a
dear
lady
in
america
who
would
love
you
and
take
care
of
you
so
you
need
never
be
lonely
and
sad
again
but
our
mother
gasped
marie
bursting
into
tears
we
have
not
found
her
you
will
not
lose
her
any
more
by
going
to
america
said
the
lady
for
you
see
we
shall
know
all
about
you
here
and
if
your
mother
comes
we
shall
be
able
to
tell
her
just
where
to
find
you
meanwhile
you
will
be
safe
and
well
cared
for
far
away
from
all
the
dreadful
things
that
are
happening
here
it
is
so
far
away
sobbed
marie
jan
said
nothing
he
was
busy
swallowing
lumps
in
his
own
throat
you
see
dears
the
lady
said
gently
you
can
be
together
there
for
this
woman
has
no
children
of
her
own
and
is
willing
to
take
both
of
you
that
does
not
often
happen
and
besides
she
is
a
belgian
i
know
you
will
find
a
good
home
with
her
you
sure
we
could
be
together
asked
yes
said
the
lady
because
said
jan
mother
said
i
must
take
care
of
marie
and
she
said
she
find
us
again
if
she
had
to
swim
the
sea
said
marie
feeling
of
her
locket
and
smiling
through
her
tears
she
wo
have
to
swim
said
the
lady
we
will
see
to
that
if
she
comes
here
she
shall
go
for
you
in
a
fine
big
ship
and
so
that
all
settled
she
kissed
their
woebegone
little
faces
you
are
going
to
start
she
said
the
good
captain
of
the
ship
has
promised
to
take
care
of
you
so
you
will
not
be
afraid
and
i
know
you
will
be
good
children
it
seemed
like
a
month
to
jan
and
marie
but
it
was
really
only
seven
days
later
that
they
stood
on
the
deck
of
the
good
ship
caspian
as
it
steamed
proudly
into
the
wonderful
harbor
of
new
york
it
was
dusk
and
already
the
lights
of
the
city
sparkled
like
a
sky
full
of
stars
dropped
down
to
earth
high
above
the
other
stars
shone
the
great
torch
of
liberty
enlightening
the
world
oh
gasped
marie
as
she
gazed
new
york
must
be
as
big
as
heaven
do
you
suppose
that
is
an
angel
holding
a
candle
to
light
us
in
just
then
the
captain
came
to
find
them
and
a
few
minutes
later
they
walked
with
him
down
the
gangplank
right
into
a
pair
of
outstretched
arms
the
arms
belonged
to
madame
dujardin
their
new
mother
i
should
have
known
them
the
moment
i
looked
at
them
even
if
they
had
been
with
the
captain
she
cried
to
her
husband
who
stood
smiling
by
her
side
poor
darlings
your
troubles
are
all
over
now
just
as
soon
as
captain
nichols
says
you
may
you
shall
come
with
us
and
oh
i
have
so
many
things
to
show
you
in
your
new
home
she
drew
them
with
her
to
a
quieter
part
of
the
dock
while
her
husband
talked
with
the
captain
and
then
when
they
had
bidden
him
they
were
bundled
into
a
waiting
motor
car
and
whirled
away
through
miles
of
brilliantly
lighted
streets
and
over
a
wonderful
bridge
and
on
and
on
until
they
came
to
green
lawns
and
houses
set
among
trees
and
shrubs
and
it
seemed
to
the
children
as
if
they
must
have
reached
the
very
end
of
the
world
at
last
the
car
stopped
before
a
house
standing
some
distance
back
from
the
street
in
a
large
yard
and
the
children
followed
their
new
friends
through
the
bright
doorway
of
their
house
madame
dujardin
helped
them
take
off
their
things
in
the
pleasant
hallway
where
an
open
fire
was
burning
and
later
when
they
were
washed
and
ready
she
led
the
way
to
a
cheerful
dining
room
where
there
was
a
pretty
table
set
for
four
there
were
flowers
on
the
table
and
they
had
chicken
for
supper
and
after
that
ice
cream
jan
and
marie
had
never
tasted
ice
cream
before
in
their
whole
lives
they
thought
they
should
like
america
very
much
after
supper
their
new
mother
took
them
upstairs
and
showed
them
two
little
rooms
with
a
bathroom
between
one
room
was
all
pink
and
white
with
a
dear
little
white
bed
in
it
and
she
said
to
marie
this
is
your
room
my
dear
the
other
room
was
all
in
blue
and
white
with
another
dear
little
white
bed
in
it
and
she
said
to
jan
this
is
your
room
my
dear
and
there
were
clean
white
on
the
beds
and
little
wrappers
with
gay
flowered
slippers
just
waiting
for
jan
and
marie
to
put
them
on
oh
i
believe
it
is
heaven
cried
marie
as
she
looked
about
the
pretty
room
then
she
touched
madame
dujardin
sleeve
timidly
is
it
all
true
she
said
sha
we
wake
up
and
have
to
go
somewhere
else
pretty
soon
no
dear
said
madame
dujardin
gently
you
are
going
to
stay
right
here
now
and
be
happy
it
will
be
a
very
nice
place
for
mother
to
find
us
in
said
she
will
come
pretty
soon
now
i
should
think
i
hope
she
may
said
madame
dujardin
tears
twinkling
in
her
eyes
i
sure
she
will
said
marie
you
see
everybody
is
looking
for
her
there
granny
and
mother
and
father
de
smet
and
joseph
and
the
people
in
rotterdam
and
the
people
in
england
too
and
then
besides
mother
is
looking
for
herself
of
course
she
said
she
would
surely
find
us
even
if
she
had
to
swim
the
sea
added
xiv
the
most
wonderful
part
and
now
comes
the
most
wonderful
part
of
the
story
madame
dujardin
prepared
a
bath
and
said
to
marie
you
may
have
the
first
turn
in
the
tub
because
you
a
girl
in
america
the
girls
have
the
best
of
everything
she
laughed
at
jan
as
she
spoke
i
will
help
you
undress
jan
you
may
get
ready
and
wait
for
your
turn
in
your
own
room
she
unbuttoned
marie
dress
slipped
off
her
clothes
and
held
up
the
gay
little
wrapper
for
her
to
put
her
arms
into
and
just
then
she
noticed
the
locket
on
her
neck
we
take
this
off
too
she
said
beginning
to
unclasp
it
but
marie
clung
to
it
with
both
hands
no
no
she
cried
mother
said
i
was
never
never
to
take
it
off
it
has
her
picture
in
it
may
i
see
it
dear
asked
madame
dujardin
i
should
like
to
know
what
your
mother
looks
like
marie
nestled
close
to
her
and
madame
dujardin
opened
the
locket
for
a
moment
she
gazed
at
the
picture
in
complete
silence
her
eyes
staring
at
it
like
two
blue
lights
then
she
burst
into
a
wild
fit
of
weeping
and
cried
out
leonie
leonie
it
is
not
possible
my
own
sister
children
she
clasped
the
bewildered
marie
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
over
and
over
again
she
ran
to
the
door
and
brought
in
jan
and
kissed
him
and
then
she
called
her
husband
when
he
came
in
and
saw
her
with
her
arms
around
both
children
at
once
holding
the
locket
in
her
hands
and
laughing
and
crying
both
together
he
too
was
bewildered
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
julie
he
cried
for
answer
she
pointed
to
the
face
in
the
locket
leonie
leonie
she
cried
they
are
my
own
sister
children
surely
the
hand
of
god
is
in
this
her
husband
looked
at
the
locket
so
it
is
so
it
is
he
said
in
astonishment
i
thought
at
first
you
had
gone
crazy
see
cried
his
wife
it
her
and
afterward
she
gave
me
those
very
beads
she
has
around
her
neck
i
have
them
yet
she
rushed
from
the
room
and
returned
in
a
moment
with
the
beads
in
her
hand
meanwhile
jan
and
marie
had
stood
still
too
astonished
to
do
more
than
stare
from
one
amazed
and
excited
face
to
the
other
as
their
new
father
and
mother
gazed
first
at
them
and
then
at
the
locket
and
last
at
the
beads
scarcely
daring
to
believe
the
testimony
of
their
own
eyes
to
think
cried
madame
dujardin
at
last
that
i
should
not
have
known
but
there
are
many
van
hoves
in
belgium
and
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
they
could
be
my
own
flesh
and
blood
it
is
years
since
i
have
heard
from
leonie
in
fact
i
hardly
knew
she
had
any
children
our
lives
have
been
so
different
oh
it
is
all
my
fault
she
cried
weeping
again
but
if
i
have
neglected
her
i
will
make
it
up
to
her
children
it
may
be
oh
it
is
just
possible
that
she
is
still
alive
and
that
she
may
yet
write
to
me
after
all
these
years
sorrow
sometimes
bridges
wide
streams
then
she
turned
more
quietly
to
the
children
you
see
dears
she
said
i
left
belgium
many
years
ago
and
came
with
your
uncle
to
this
country
we
were
poor
when
we
came
but
your
uncle
has
prospered
as
one
can
in
america
at
first
leonie
and
i
wrote
regularly
to
each
other
then
she
grew
more
and
more
busy
and
we
seemed
to
have
no
ties
in
common
so
that
at
last
we
lost
sight
of
each
other
altogether
she
opened
her
arms
to
marie
and
jan
as
she
spoke
and
held
them
for
some
time
in
a
close
embrace
finally
she
lifted
her
head
and
laughed
this
will
never
do
she
exclaimed
you
must
have
your
baths
even
if
you
are
my
own
dear
niece
and
nephew
the
water
must
be
perfectly
cold
by
this
time
she
went
into
the
bathroom
turned
on
more
hot
water
and
popped
marie
into
the
tub
in
half
an
hour
both
children
had
said
their
prayers
and
were
tucked
away
for
the
night
in
their
clean
white
beds
wonderful
days
followed
for
jan
and
marie
they
began
to
go
to
school
they
had
pretty
clothes
and
many
toys
and
began
to
make
friends
among
the
little
american
children
of
the
neighborhood
but
in
the
midst
of
these
new
joys
they
did
not
forget
their
mother
still
looking
for
them
or
their
father
now
fighting
as
they
supposed
in
the
cruel
trenches
of
belgium
but
at
last
there
came
a
day
when
aunt
julie
received
a
letter
with
a
foreign
postmark
she
opened
it
with
trembling
fingers
and
when
she
saw
that
it
began
my
dear
sister
julie
she
wept
so
for
joy
that
she
could
not
see
to
read
it
and
her
husband
had
to
read
it
for
her
this
was
the
letter
you
will
perhaps
wonder
at
hearing
from
me
after
the
long
years
of
silence
that
have
passed
but
i
have
never
doubted
the
goodness
of
your
heart
my
julie
nor
your
love
for
your
poor
leonie
even
though
our
paths
in
life
have
led
such
different
ways
and
now
i
must
tell
you
of
the
sorrows
which
have
broken
my
heart
georges
was
obliged
to
go
into
the
army
at
a
moment
notice
when
the
war
broke
out
a
few
days
later
the
germans
swept
through
meer
driving
the
people
before
them
like
chaff
before
the
wind
as
our
house
was
on
the
edge
of
the
village
i
was
the
first
to
see
them
coming
i
hid
the
children
in
the
vegetable
cellar
but
before
i
could
get
to
a
for
myself
they
swept
over
the
town
driving
every
man
woman
and
child
before
them
to
turn
back
then
was
impossible
and
it
was
only
after
weeks
of
hardship
and
danger
that
i
at
last
succeeded
in
struggling
through
the
territory
occupied
by
germans
to
the
empty
city
of
malines
and
the
deserted
village
where
we
had
been
so
happy
on
the
kitchen
door
of
our
home
i
found
a
paper
pinned
on
it
was
printed
dear
mother
we
have
gone
to
malines
to
find
you
jan
and
marie
since
then
i
have
searched
every
place
where
there
seemed
any
possibility
of
my
finding
my
dear
children
but
no
trace
of
them
can
i
find
then
through
friends
in
antwerp
i
learned
that
georges
had
been
wounded
and
was
in
a
hospital
there
and
i
went
at
once
to
find
him
he
had
lost
an
arm
in
the
fighting
before
antwerp
and
was
removed
to
holland
after
the
siege
began
here
we
have
remained
since
still
hoping
god
would
hear
our
prayers
and
give
us
news
of
our
dear
children
it
would
even
be
a
comfort
to
know
surely
of
their
death
and
if
i
could
know
that
they
were
alive
and
well
i
think
i
should
die
of
joy
georges
can
fight
no
more
our
home
is
lost
we
are
beggars
until
this
war
is
over
and
our
country
once
more
restored
to
us
i
am
now
at
work
in
a
factory
earning
what
keeps
body
and
soul
together
georges
must
soon
leave
the
hospital
then
god
knows
what
may
befall
us
how
i
wish
we
had
been
wise
like
you
my
julie
and
your
paul
and
that
we
had
gone
with
you
to
america
years
ago
i
might
then
have
my
children
with
me
in
comfort
if
you
get
this
letter
write
to
your
leonie
it
was
not
a
letter
that
went
back
that
very
day
it
was
a
cablegram
and
it
said
jan
and
marie
are
safe
with
me
am
sending
money
with
this
to
the
bank
of
holland
for
your
passage
to
america
come
at
once
julie
people
do
not
die
of
joy
or
i
am
sure
that
father
and
mother
van
hove
would
never
have
survived
the
reading
of
that
message
instead
it
put
such
new
strength
and
energy
into
their
weary
souls
and
bodies
that
two
days
later
they
were
on
their
way
to
england
and
a
week
later
still
they
stood
on
the
deck
of
the
arabia
as
it
steamed
into
new
york
harbor
jan
and
marie
with
uncle
paul
and
aunt
julie
met
them
at
the
dock
and
there
are
very
few
meetings
this
side
of
heaven
like
the
reunion
of
those
six
persons
on
that
day
the
story
of
that
first
evening
together
can
hardly
be
told
first
father
and
mother
van
hove
listened
to
jan
and
marie
as
they
told
of
their
wanderings
with
fidel
of
the
little
old
eel
woman
of
father
and
mother
de
smet
of
the
attack
by
germans
and
of
the
friends
they
found
in
holland
and
in
england
and
when
everybody
had
cried
a
good
deal
about
that
father
van
hove
told
what
had
happened
to
him
then
mother
van
hove
told
of
her
long
and
perilous
search
for
her
children
and
there
were
more
tears
of
thankfulness
and
joy
until
it
seemed
as
if
their
hearts
were
filled
to
the
brim
and
running
over
but
when
last
of
all
uncle
paul
told
of
the
plans
which
he
and
aunt
julie
had
made
for
the
family
they
found
there
was
room
in
their
hearts
for
still
more
joy
i
have
a
farm
in
the
country
said
uncle
paul
it
is
not
very
far
from
new
york
there
is
a
good
house
on
it
it
is
already
stocked
i
need
a
farmer
to
take
care
of
the
place
for
me
and
trustworthy
help
is
hard
to
get
here
if
you
will
manage
it
for
me
brother
georges
i
shall
have
no
further
anxiety
about
it
and
shall
expect
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
it
as
i
have
never
yet
been
able
to
do
leonie
shall
make
some
of
her
good
butter
for
our
city
table
and
the
children
here
he
pinched
marie
cheek
now
round
and
rosy
once
more
the
children
shall
pick
berries
and
help
on
the
farm
all
summer
in
winter
they
can
come
back
to
uncle
paul
and
aunt
julie
and
go
to
school
here
for
they
are
our
children
now
as
well
as
yours
father
van
hove
rose
stretched
out
his
one
hand
and
grasping
uncle
paul
tried
to
thank
him
but
his
voice
failed
do
say
a
word
old
man
said
uncle
paul
clasping
father
van
hove
hand
with
both
of
his
all
the
world
owes
a
debt
to
belgium
which
it
can
never
pay
her
courage
and
devotion
have
saved
the
rest
of
us
from
the
miseries
she
has
borne
so
bravely
if
you
got
your
just
deserts
you
get
much
more
than
i
can
ever
give
you
in
the
end
it
all
came
about
just
as
uncle
paul
had
said
and
the
van
hoves
are
living
in
comfort
and
happiness
on
that
farm
this
very
day
the
end
suggestions
to
teachers
american
children
who
have
been
giving
their
pennies
to
help
take
care
of
little
belgian
children
will
find
this
new
twins
book
one
of
the
most
appealing
that
perkins
has
ever
written
the
author
preface
states
the
sources
of
her
inspiration
as
usual
her
story
will
be
found
sympathetic
in
spirit
and
accurate
as
to
facts
at
the
present
day
books
are
constantly
issuing
from
the
press
which
will
assist
teachers
in
planning
their
own
preparation
for
the
class
reading
of
this
book
for
example
griffis
belgium
the
land
of
art
and
gibson
a
journal
from
our
legation
in
belgium
books
issued
in
past
years
which
tell
other
stories
of
exile
or
emigration
or
which
deal
with
european
countries
neighboring
belgium
also
have
their
place
in
the
teacher
reading
we
may
suggest
griffis
the
pilgrims
in
their
three
homes
and
brave
little
holland
and
history
of
medieval
and
modern
europe
sections
and
the
account
of
the
present
war
a
file
of
the
national
geographic
magazine
accessible
in
most
public
libraries
will
be
found
to
contain
many
articles
and
illustrations
which
will
be
invaluable
in
this
connection
picture
postcards
also
will
supply
a
wealth
of
appropriate
subjects
children
should
be
encouraged
to
bring
material
of
this
sort
to
school
once
the
historical
and
geographical
background
has
been
sketched
the
teacher
may
safely
trust
the
children
to
get
the
most
out
of
the
story
fifth
grade
pupils
can
read
it
without
preparation
pupils
in
the
fourth
grade
should
first
read
it
in
a
study
period
in
order
to
work
out
the
pronunciation
of
the
more
difficult
words
the
possibilities
for
dramatization
will
be
immediately
apparent
in
this
the
author
illustrations
will
as
in
all
the
twins
books
furnish
hints
as
to
scenes
and
action
they
may
likewise
be
used
as
the
subjects
of
both
oral
and
written
compositions
each
pupil
selecting
the
picture
most
interesting
to
him
and
retelling
its
story
in
his
own
words
the
illustrations
may
be
used
also
as
models
for
the
sketching
their
simple
style
renders
them
especially
suitable
for
this
use
