to
you
blue
wednesday
the
first
wednesday
in
every
month
was
a
perfectly
awful
day
a
day
to
be
awaited
with
dread
endured
with
courage
and
forgotten
with
haste
every
floor
must
be
spotless
every
chair
dustless
and
every
bed
without
a
wrinkle
squirming
little
orphans
must
be
scrubbed
and
combed
and
buttoned
into
freshly
starched
ginghams
and
all
reminded
of
their
manners
and
told
to
say
sir
sir
whenever
a
trustee
spoke
it
was
a
distressing
time
and
poor
jerusha
abbott
being
the
oldest
orphan
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
it
but
this
particular
first
wednesday
like
its
predecessors
finally
dragged
itself
to
a
close
jerusha
escaped
from
the
pantry
where
she
had
been
making
sandwiches
for
the
asylum
guests
and
turned
upstairs
to
accomplish
her
regular
work
her
special
care
was
room
f
where
eleven
little
tots
from
four
to
seven
occupied
eleven
little
cots
set
in
a
row
jerusha
assembled
her
charges
straightened
their
rumpled
frocks
wiped
their
noses
and
started
them
in
an
orderly
and
willing
line
towards
the
to
engage
themselves
for
a
blessed
half
hour
with
bread
and
milk
and
prune
pudding
then
she
dropped
down
on
the
window
seat
and
leaned
throbbing
temples
against
the
cool
glass
she
had
been
on
her
feet
since
five
that
morning
doing
everybody
bidding
scolded
and
hurried
by
a
nervous
matron
lippett
behind
the
scenes
did
not
always
maintain
that
calm
and
pompous
dignity
with
which
she
faced
an
audience
of
trustees
and
lady
visitors
jerusha
gazed
out
across
a
broad
stretch
of
frozen
lawn
beyond
the
tall
iron
paling
that
marked
the
confines
of
the
asylum
down
undulating
ridges
sprinkled
with
country
estates
to
the
spires
of
the
village
rising
from
the
midst
of
bare
trees
the
day
was
ended
quite
successfully
so
far
as
she
knew
the
trustees
and
the
visiting
committee
had
made
their
rounds
and
read
their
reports
and
drunk
their
tea
and
now
were
hurrying
home
to
their
own
cheerful
firesides
to
forget
their
bothersome
little
charges
for
another
month
jerusha
leaned
forward
watching
with
curiosity
and
a
touch
of
wistfulness
the
stream
of
carriages
and
automobiles
that
rolled
out
of
the
asylum
gates
in
imagination
she
followed
first
one
equipage
then
another
to
the
big
houses
dotted
along
the
hillside
she
pictured
herself
in
a
fur
coat
and
a
velvet
hat
trimmed
with
feathers
leaning
back
in
the
seat
and
nonchalantly
murmuring
to
the
driver
but
on
the
of
her
home
the
picture
grew
blurred
jerusha
had
an
imagination
an
imagination
lippett
told
her
that
would
get
her
into
trouble
if
she
did
take
care
but
keen
as
it
was
it
could
not
carry
her
beyond
the
front
porch
of
the
houses
she
would
enter
poor
eager
adventurous
little
jerusha
in
all
her
seventeen
years
had
never
stepped
inside
an
ordinary
house
she
could
not
picture
the
daily
routine
of
those
other
human
beings
who
carried
on
their
lives
undiscommoded
by
orphans
you
are
in
the
and
i
think
better
hurry
up
tommy
dillon
who
had
joined
the
choir
came
singing
up
the
stairs
and
down
the
corridor
his
chant
growing
louder
as
he
approached
room
jerusha
wrenched
herself
from
the
window
and
refaced
the
troubles
of
life
wants
me
she
cut
into
tommy
chant
with
a
note
of
sharp
anxiety
lippett
in
the
office
and
i
think
she
mad
tommy
piously
intoned
but
his
accent
was
not
entirely
malicious
even
the
most
hardened
little
orphan
felt
sympathy
for
an
erring
sister
who
was
summoned
to
the
office
to
face
an
annoyed
matron
and
tommy
liked
jerusha
even
if
she
did
sometimes
jerk
him
by
the
arm
and
nearly
scrub
his
nose
off
jerusha
went
without
comment
but
with
two
parallel
lines
on
her
brow
what
could
have
gone
wrong
she
wondered
were
the
sandwiches
not
thin
enough
were
there
shells
in
the
nut
cakes
had
a
lady
visitor
seen
the
hole
in
susie
hawthorn
stocking
had
o
horrors
one
of
the
cherubic
little
babes
in
her
own
room
f
a
trustee
the
long
lower
hall
had
not
been
lighted
and
as
she
came
downstairs
a
last
trustee
stood
on
the
point
of
departure
in
the
open
door
that
led
to
the
jerusha
caught
only
a
fleeting
impression
of
the
man
and
the
impression
consisted
entirely
of
tallness
he
was
waving
his
arm
towards
an
automobile
waiting
in
the
curved
drive
as
it
sprang
into
motion
and
approached
head
on
for
an
instant
the
glaring
headlights
threw
his
shadow
sharply
against
the
wall
inside
the
shadow
pictured
grotesquely
elongated
legs
and
arms
that
ran
along
the
floor
and
up
the
wall
of
the
corridor
it
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
huge
wavering
jerusha
anxious
frown
gave
place
to
quick
laughter
she
was
by
nature
a
sunny
soul
and
had
always
snatched
the
tiniest
excuse
to
be
amused
if
one
could
derive
any
sort
of
entertainment
out
of
the
oppressive
fact
of
a
trustee
it
was
something
unexpected
to
the
good
she
advanced
to
the
office
quite
cheered
by
the
tiny
episode
and
presented
a
smiling
face
to
lippett
to
her
surprise
the
matron
was
also
if
not
exactly
smiling
at
least
appreciably
affable
she
wore
an
expression
almost
as
pleasant
as
the
one
she
donned
for
visitors
down
jerusha
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
jerusha
dropped
into
the
nearest
chair
and
waited
with
a
touch
of
breathlessness
an
automobile
flashed
past
the
window
lippett
glanced
after
it
you
notice
the
gentleman
who
has
just
gone
saw
his
back
is
one
of
our
most
affluential
trustees
and
has
given
large
sums
of
money
towards
the
asylum
support
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
mention
his
name
he
expressly
stipulated
that
he
was
to
remain
unknown
jerusha
eyes
widened
slightly
she
was
not
accustomed
to
being
summoned
to
the
office
to
discuss
the
eccentricities
of
trustees
with
the
matron
gentleman
has
taken
an
interest
in
several
of
our
boys
you
remember
charles
benton
and
henry
freize
they
were
both
sent
through
college
by
er
this
trustee
and
both
have
repaid
with
hard
work
and
success
the
money
that
was
so
generously
expended
other
payment
the
gentleman
does
not
wish
heretofore
his
philanthropies
have
been
directed
solely
towards
the
boys
i
have
never
been
able
to
interest
him
in
the
slightest
degree
in
any
of
the
girls
in
the
institution
no
matter
how
deserving
he
does
not
i
may
tell
you
care
for
girls
jerusha
murmured
since
some
reply
seemed
to
be
expected
at
this
point
at
the
regular
meeting
the
question
of
your
future
was
brought
up
lippett
allowed
a
moment
of
silence
to
fall
then
resumed
in
a
slow
placid
manner
extremely
trying
to
her
hearer
suddenly
tightened
nerves
as
you
know
the
children
are
not
kept
after
they
are
sixteen
but
an
exception
was
made
in
your
case
you
had
finished
our
school
at
fourteen
and
having
done
so
well
in
your
studies
not
always
i
must
say
in
your
conduct
it
was
determined
to
let
you
go
on
in
the
village
high
school
now
you
are
finishing
that
and
of
course
the
asylum
can
not
be
responsible
any
longer
for
your
support
as
it
is
you
have
had
two
years
more
than
most
lippett
overlooked
the
fact
that
jerusha
had
worked
hard
for
her
board
during
those
two
years
that
the
convenience
of
the
asylum
had
come
first
and
her
education
second
that
on
days
like
the
present
she
was
kept
at
home
to
scrub
i
say
the
question
of
your
future
was
brought
up
and
your
record
was
discussed
thoroughly
discussed
lippett
brought
accusing
eyes
to
bear
upon
the
prisoner
in
the
dock
and
the
prisoner
looked
guilty
because
it
seemed
to
be
expected
not
because
she
could
remember
any
strikingly
black
pages
in
her
record
course
the
usual
disposition
of
one
in
your
place
would
be
to
put
you
in
a
position
where
you
could
begin
to
work
but
you
have
done
well
in
school
in
certain
branches
it
seems
that
your
work
in
english
has
even
been
brilliant
miss
pritchard
who
is
on
our
visiting
committee
is
also
on
the
school
board
she
has
been
talking
with
your
rhetoric
teacher
and
made
a
speech
in
your
favour
she
also
read
aloud
an
essay
that
you
had
written
entitled
blue
wednesday
jerusha
guilty
expression
this
time
was
not
assumed
seemed
to
me
that
you
showed
little
gratitude
in
holding
up
to
ridicule
the
institution
that
has
done
so
much
for
you
had
you
not
managed
to
be
funny
i
doubt
if
you
would
have
been
forgiven
but
fortunately
for
you
that
is
the
gentleman
who
has
just
gone
appears
to
have
an
immoderate
sense
of
humour
on
the
strength
of
that
impertinent
paper
he
has
offered
to
send
you
to
college
college
jerusha
eyes
grew
big
lippett
nodded
waited
to
discuss
the
terms
with
me
they
are
unusual
the
gentleman
i
may
say
is
erratic
he
believes
that
you
have
originality
and
he
is
planning
to
educate
you
to
become
a
writer
writer
jerusha
mind
was
numbed
she
could
only
repeat
lippett
words
is
his
wish
whether
anything
will
come
of
it
the
future
will
show
he
is
giving
you
a
very
liberal
allowance
almost
for
a
girl
who
has
never
had
any
experience
in
taking
care
of
money
too
liberal
but
he
planned
the
matter
in
detail
and
i
did
not
feel
free
to
make
any
suggestions
you
are
to
remain
here
through
the
summer
and
miss
pritchard
has
kindly
offered
to
superintend
your
outfit
your
board
and
tuition
will
be
paid
directly
to
the
college
and
you
will
receive
in
addition
during
the
four
years
you
are
there
an
allowance
of
dollars
a
month
this
will
enable
you
to
enter
on
the
same
standing
as
the
other
students
the
money
will
be
sent
to
you
by
the
gentleman
private
secretary
once
a
month
and
in
return
you
will
write
a
letter
of
acknowledgment
once
a
month
that
is
you
are
not
to
thank
him
for
the
money
he
does
care
to
have
that
mentioned
but
you
are
to
write
a
letter
telling
of
the
progress
in
your
studies
and
the
details
of
your
daily
life
just
such
a
letter
as
you
would
write
to
your
parents
if
they
were
living
letters
will
be
addressed
to
john
smith
and
will
be
sent
in
care
of
the
secretary
the
gentleman
name
is
not
john
smith
but
he
prefers
to
remain
unknown
to
you
he
will
never
be
anything
but
john
smith
his
reason
in
requiring
the
letters
is
that
he
thinks
nothing
so
fosters
facility
in
literary
expression
as
since
you
have
no
family
with
whom
to
correspond
he
desires
you
to
write
in
this
way
also
he
wishes
to
keep
track
of
your
progress
he
will
never
answer
your
letters
nor
in
the
slightest
particular
take
any
notice
of
them
he
detests
and
does
not
wish
you
to
become
a
burden
if
any
point
should
ever
arise
where
an
answer
would
seem
to
be
imperative
such
as
in
the
event
of
your
being
expelled
which
i
trust
will
not
occur
you
may
correspond
with
griggs
his
secretary
these
monthly
letters
are
absolutely
obligatory
on
your
part
they
are
the
only
payment
that
smith
requires
so
you
must
be
as
punctilious
in
sending
them
as
though
it
were
a
bill
that
you
were
paying
i
hope
that
they
will
always
be
respectful
in
tone
and
will
reflect
credit
on
your
training
you
must
remember
that
you
are
writing
to
a
trustee
of
the
john
grier
home
jerusha
eyes
longingly
sought
the
door
her
head
was
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
and
she
wished
only
to
escape
from
platitudes
and
think
she
rose
and
took
a
tentative
step
backwards
lippett
detained
her
with
a
gesture
it
was
an
oratorical
opportunity
not
to
be
slighted
trust
that
you
are
properly
grateful
for
this
very
rare
good
fortune
that
has
befallen
you
not
many
girls
in
your
position
ever
have
such
an
opportunity
to
rise
in
the
world
you
must
always
remember
yes
thank
you
i
think
if
that
all
i
must
go
and
sew
a
patch
on
freddie
perkins
trousers
the
door
closed
behind
her
and
lippett
watched
it
with
dropped
jaw
her
peroration
in
the
letters
of
miss
jerusha
abbott
to
smith
fergussen
hall
september
dear
here
i
am
i
travelled
yesterday
for
four
hours
in
a
train
it
a
funny
sensation
is
it
i
never
rode
in
one
before
college
is
the
biggest
most
bewildering
place
i
get
lost
whenever
i
leave
my
room
i
will
write
you
a
description
later
when
i
feeling
less
muddled
also
i
will
tell
you
about
my
lessons
classes
begin
until
monday
morning
and
this
is
saturday
night
but
i
wanted
to
write
a
letter
first
just
to
get
acquainted
it
seems
queer
to
be
writing
letters
to
somebody
you
do
know
it
seems
queer
for
me
to
be
writing
letters
at
all
i
never
written
more
than
three
or
four
in
my
life
so
please
overlook
it
if
these
are
not
a
model
kind
before
leaving
yesterday
morning
lippett
and
i
had
a
very
serious
talk
she
told
me
how
to
behave
all
the
rest
of
my
life
and
especially
how
to
behave
towards
the
kind
gentleman
who
is
doing
so
much
for
me
i
must
take
care
to
be
very
respectful
but
how
can
one
be
very
respectful
to
a
person
who
wishes
to
be
called
john
smith
why
could
you
have
picked
out
a
name
with
a
little
personality
i
might
as
well
write
letters
to
dear
or
dear
i
have
been
thinking
about
you
a
great
deal
this
summer
having
somebody
take
an
interest
in
me
after
all
these
years
makes
me
feel
as
though
i
had
found
a
sort
of
family
it
seems
as
though
i
belonged
to
somebody
now
and
it
a
very
comfortable
sensation
i
must
say
however
that
when
i
think
about
you
my
imagination
has
very
little
to
work
upon
there
are
just
three
things
that
i
know
i
you
are
tall
ii
you
are
rich
iii
you
hate
girls
i
suppose
i
might
call
you
dear
only
that
rather
insulting
to
me
or
dear
but
that
insulting
to
you
as
though
money
were
the
only
important
thing
about
you
besides
being
rich
is
such
a
very
external
quality
maybe
you
wo
stay
rich
all
your
life
lots
of
very
clever
men
get
smashed
up
in
wall
street
but
at
least
you
will
stay
tall
all
your
life
so
i
decided
to
call
you
dear
i
hope
you
wo
mind
it
just
a
private
pet
name
we
wo
tell
lippett
the
ten
bell
is
going
to
ring
in
two
minutes
our
day
is
divided
into
sections
by
bells
we
eat
and
sleep
and
study
by
bells
it
very
enlivening
i
feel
like
a
fire
horse
all
of
the
time
there
it
goes
lights
out
good
night
observe
with
what
precision
i
obey
rules
due
to
my
training
in
the
john
grier
home
yours
most
respectfully
jerusha
abbott
to
smith
october
dear
i
love
college
and
i
love
you
for
sending
me
i
very
very
happy
and
so
excited
every
moment
of
the
time
that
i
can
scarcely
sleep
you
ca
imagine
how
different
it
is
from
the
john
grier
home
i
never
dreamed
there
was
such
a
place
in
the
world
i
feeling
sorry
for
everybody
who
is
a
girl
and
who
ca
come
here
i
am
sure
the
college
you
attended
when
you
were
a
boy
could
have
been
so
nice
my
room
is
up
in
a
tower
that
used
to
be
the
contagious
ward
before
they
built
the
new
infirmary
there
are
three
other
girls
on
the
same
floor
of
the
tower
a
senior
who
wears
spectacles
and
is
always
asking
us
please
to
be
a
little
more
quiet
and
two
freshmen
named
sallie
mcbride
and
julia
rutledge
pendleton
sallie

red
hair
and
a
nose

friendly
julia

from
one
of
the
first
families
in
new
york
and
has
noticed
me
yet
they
room
together
and
the
senior
and
i
have
singles
usually
freshmen
ca
get
singles
they
are
very
scarce
but
i
got
one
without
even
asking
i
suppose
the
registrar
did
think
it
would
be
right
to
ask
a
properly
girl
to
room
with
a
foundling
you
see
there
are
advantages
my
room
is
on
the
corner
with
two
windows
and
a
view
after
you
lived
in
a
ward
for
eighteen
years
with
twenty
it
is
restful
to
be
alone
this
is
the
first
chance
i
ever
had
to
get
acquainted
with
jerusha
abbott
i
think
i
going
to
like
her
do
you
think
you
are
tuesday
they
are
organizing
the
freshman
team
and
there
just
a
chance
that
i
shall
get
in
it
i
little
of
course
but
terribly
quick
and
wiry
and
tough
while
the
others
are
hopping
about
in
the
air
i
can
dodge
under
their
feet
and
grab
the
ball
it
loads
of
fun
practising
out
in
the
athletic
field
in
the
afternoon
with
the
trees
all
red
and
yellow
and
the
air
full
of
the
smell
of
burning
leaves
and
everybody
laughing
and
shouting
these
are
the
happiest
girls
i
ever
saw
and
i
am
the
happiest
of
all
i
meant
to
write
a
long
letter
and
tell
you
all
the
things
i
learning
lippett
said
you
wanted
to
know
but
hour
has
just
rung
and
in
ten
minutes
i
due
at
the
athletic
field
in
gymnasium
clothes
do
you
hope
i
get
in
the
team
yours
always
jerusha
abbott
ps
sallie
mcbride
just
poked
her
head
in
at
my
door
this
is
what
she
said
so
homesick
that
i
simply
ca
stand
it
do
you
feel
that
way
i
smiled
a
little
and
said
no
i
thought
i
could
pull
through
at
least
homesickness
is
one
disease
that
i
escaped
i
never
heard
of
anybody
being
did
you
october
dear
did
you
ever
hear
of
michael
angelo
he
was
a
famous
artist
who
lived
in
italy
in
the
middle
ages
everybody
in
english
literature
seemed
to
know
about
him
and
the
whole
class
laughed
because
i
thought
he
was
an
archangel
he
sounds
like
an
archangel
does
he
the
trouble
with
college
is
that
you
are
expected
to
know
such
a
lot
of
things
you
never
learned
it
very
embarrassing
at
times
but
now
when
the
girls
talk
about
things
that
i
never
heard
of
i
just
keep
still
and
look
them
up
in
the
encyclopedia
i
made
an
awful
mistake
the
first
day
somebody
mentioned
maurice
maeterlinck
and
i
asked
if
she
was
a
freshman
that
joke
has
gone
all
over
college
but
anyway
i
just
as
bright
in
class
as
any
of
the
others
and
brighter
than
some
of
them
do
you
care
to
know
how
i
furnished
my
room
it
a
symphony
in
brown
and
yellow
the
wall
was
tinted
buff
and
i
bought
yellow
denim
curtains
and
cushions
and
a
mahogany
desk
second
hand
for
three
dollars
and
a
rattan
chair
and
a
brown
rug
with
an
ink
spot
in
the
middle
i
stand
the
chair
over
the
spot
the
windows
are
up
high
you
ca
look
out
from
an
ordinary
seat
but
i
unscrewed
the
from
the
back
of
the
bureau
upholstered
the
top
and
moved
it
up
against
the
window
it
just
the
right
height
for
a
window
seat
you
pull
out
the
drawers
like
steps
and
walk
up
very
comfortable
sallie
mcbride
helped
me
choose
the
things
at
the
senior
auction
she
has
lived
in
a
house
all
her
life
and
knows
about
furnishing
you
ca
imagine
what
fun
it
is
to
shop
and
pay
with
a
real
bill
and
get
some
change
when
you
never
had
more
than
a
few
cents
in
your
life
i
assure
you
daddy
dear
i
do
appreciate
that
allowance
sallie
is
the
most
entertaining
person
in
the
world
and
julia
rutledge
pendleton
the
least
so
it
queer
what
a
mixture
the
registrar
can
make
in
the
matter
of
sallie
thinks
everything
is
funny
even
flunking
and
julia
is
bored
at
everything
she
never
makes
the
slightest
effort
to
be
amiable
she
believes
that
if
you
are
a
pendleton
that
fact
alone
admits
you
to
heaven
without
any
further
examination
julia
and
i
were
born
to
be
enemies
and
now
i
suppose
you
been
waiting
very
impatiently
to
hear
what
i
am
learning
latin
second
punic

you
never

daddy
it
does
dreadful
things
to
your
liver
wednesday
dear
i
changed
my
name
i
still
in
the
catalogue
but
i
everywhere
else
it
really
too
bad
is
it
to
have
to
give
yourself
the
only
pet
name
you
ever
had
i
did
quite
make
up
the
judy
though
what
freddy
perkins
used
to
call
me
before
he
could
talk
plainly
i
wish
lippett
would
use
a
little
more
ingenuity
about
choosing
babies
names
she
gets
the
last
names
out
of
the
telephone
book
you
find
abbott
on
the
first
page
and
she
picks
the
christian
names
up
anywhere
she
got
jerusha
from
a
tombstone
i
always
hated
it
but
i
rather
like
judy
it
such
a
silly
name
it
belongs
to
the
kind
of
girl
i
not
a
sweet
little
thing
petted
and
spoiled
by
all
the
family
who
romps
her
way
through
life
without
any
cares
would
it
be
nice
to
be
like
that
whatever
faults
i
may
have
no
one
can
ever
accuse
me
of
having
been
spoiled
by
my
family
but
it
great
fun
to
pretend
i
been
in
the
future
please
always
address
me
as
judy
do
you
want
to
know
something
i
have
three
pairs
of
kid
gloves
had
kid
mittens
before
from
the
christmas
tree
but
never
real
kid
gloves
with
five
fingers
i
take
them
out
and
try
them
on
every
little
while
it
all
i
can
do
not
to
wear
them
to
classes
dinner
bell
goodbye
friday
what
do
you
think
daddy
the
english
instructor
said
that
my
last
paper
shows
an
unusual
amount
of
originality
she
did
truly
those
were
her
words
it
does
seem
possible
does
it
considering
the
eighteen
years
of
training
that
i
had
the
aim
of
the
john
grier
home
as
you
doubtless
know
and
heartily
approve
of
is
to
turn
the
orphans
into
twins
the
unusual
artistic
ability
which
i
exhibit
was
developed
at
an
early
age
through
drawing
chalk
pictures
of
lippett
on
the
woodshed
door
i
hope
that
i
do
hurt
your
feelings
when
i
criticize
the
home
of
my
youth
but
you
have
the
upper
hand
you
know
for
if
i
become
too
impertinent
you
can
always
stop
payment
of
your
cheques
that
is
a
very
polite
thing
to
say
but
you
ca
expect
me
to
have
any
manners
a
foundling
asylum
is
a
young
ladies
finishing
school
you
know
daddy
it
is
the
work
that
is
going
to
be
hard
in
college
it
the
play
half
the
time
i
do
know
what
the
girls
are
talking
about
their
jokes
seem
to
relate
to
a
past
that
every
one
but
me
has
shared
i
a
foreigner
in
the
world
and
i
do
understand
the
language
it
a
miserable
feeling
i
had
it
all
my
life
at
the
high
school
the
girls
would
stand
in
groups
and
just
look
at
me
i
was
queer
and
different
and
everybody
knew
it
i
could
feel
grier
home
written
on
my
face
and
then
a
few
charitable
ones
would
make
a
point
of
coming
up
and
saying
something
polite
i
hated
every
one
of
them
the
charitable
ones
most
of
all
nobody
here
knows
that
i
was
brought
up
in
an
asylum
i
told
sallie
mcbride
that
my
mother
and
father
were
dead
and
that
a
kind
old
gentleman
was
sending
me
to
college
which
is
entirely
true
so
far
as
it
goes
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
am
a
coward
but
i
do
want
to
be
like
the
other
girls
and
that
dreadful
home
looming
over
my
childhood
is
the
one
great
big
difference
if
i
can
turn
my
back
on
that
and
shut
out
the
remembrance
i
think
i
might
be
just
as
desirable
as
any
other
girl
i
do
believe
there
any
real
underneath
difference
do
you
anyway
sallie
mcbride
likes
me
yours
ever
judy
abbott
nee
jerusha
saturday
morning
i
just
been
reading
this
letter
over
and
it
sounds
pretty
but
ca
you
guess
that
i
have
a
special
topic
due
monday
morning
and
a
review
in
geometry
and
a
very
sneezy
cold
sunday
i
forgot
to
post
this
yesterday
so
i
will
add
an
indignant
postscript
we
had
a
bishop
this
morning
and
what
do
you
think
he
said
most
beneficent
promise
made
us
in
the
bible
is
this
the
poor
ye
have
always
with
you
they
were
put
here
in
order
to
keep
us
charitable
the
poor
please
observe
being
a
sort
of
useful
domestic
animal
if
i
had
grown
into
such
a
perfect
lady
i
should
have
gone
up
after
service
and
told
him
what
i
thought
october
dear
i
in
the
team
and
you
ought
to
see
the
bruise
on
my
left
shoulder
it
blue
and
mahogany
with
little
streaks
of
orange
julia
pendleton
tried
for
the
team
but
she
did
get
in
hooray
you
see
what
a
mean
disposition
i
have
college
gets
nicer
and
nicer
i
like
the
girls
and
the
teachers
and
the
classes
and
the
campus
and
the
things
to
eat
we
have
twice
a
week
and
we
never
have
mush
you
only
wanted
to
hear
from
me
once
a
month
did
you
and
been
peppering
you
with
letters
every
few
days
but
i
been
so
excited
about
all
these
new
adventures
that
i
must
talk
to
somebody
and
you
the
only
one
i
know
please
excuse
my
exuberance
settle
pretty
soon
if
my
letters
bore
you
you
can
always
toss
them
into
the
wastebasket
i
promise
not
to
write
another
till
the
middle
of
november
yours
most
loquaciously
judy
abbott
november
dear
listen
to
what
i
learned
the
area
of
the
convex
surface
of
the
frustum
of
a
regular
pyramid
is
half
the
product
of
the
sum
of
the
perimeters
of
its
bases
by
the
altitude
of
either
of
its
trapezoids
it
does
sound
true
but
it
is
i
can
prove
it
you
never
heard
about
my
clothes
have
you
daddy
six
dresses
all
new
and
beautiful
and
bought
for
me
not
handed
down
from
somebody
bigger
perhaps
you
do
realize
what
a
climax
that
marks
in
the
career
of
an
orphan
you
gave
them
to
me
and
i
am
very
very
very
much
obliged
it
a
fine
thing
to
be
educated
but
nothing
compared
to
the
dizzying
experience
of
owning
six
new
dresses
miss
pritchard
who
is
on
the
visiting
committee
picked
them
out
not
lippett
thank
goodness
i
have
an
evening
dress
pink
mull
over
silk
perfectly
beautiful
in
that
and
a
blue
church
dress
and
a
dinner
dress
of
red
veiling
with
oriental
trimming
makes
me
look
like
a
gipsy
and
another
of
challis
and
a
grey
street
suit
and
an
dress
for
classes
that
would
be
an
awfully
big
wardrobe
for
julia
rutledge
pendleton
perhaps
but
for
jerusha
abbott
oh
my
i
suppose
you
thinking
now
what
a
frivolous
shallow
little
beast
she
is
and
what
a
waste
of
money
to
educate
a
girl
but
daddy
if
you
been
dressed
in
checked
ginghams
all
your
life
you
appreciate
how
i
feel
and
when
i
started
to
the
high
school
i
entered
upon
another
period
even
worse
than
the
checked
ginghams
the
poor
box
you
ca
know
how
i
dreaded
appearing
in
school
in
those
miserable
dresses
i
was
perfectly
sure
to
be
put
down
in
class
next
to
the
girl
who
first
owned
my
dress
and
she
would
whisper
and
giggle
and
point
it
out
to
the
others
the
bitterness
of
wearing
your
clothes
eats
into
your
soul
if
i
wore
silk
stockings
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
do
believe
i
could
obliterate
the
scar
latest
war
bulletin
news
from
the
scene
of
action
at
the
fourth
watch
on
thursday
the
of
november
hannibal
routed
the
advance
guard
of
the
romans
and
led
the
carthaginian
forces
over
the
mountains
into
the
plains
of
casilinum
a
cohort
of
light
armed
numidians
engaged
the
infantry
of
quintus
fabius
maximus
two
battles
and
light
skirmishing
romans
repulsed
with
heavy
losses
i
have
the
honour
of
being
your
special
correspondent
from
the
front
abbott
ps
i
know
i
not
to
expect
any
letters
in
return
and
i
been
warned
not
to
bother
you
with
questions
but
tell
me
daddy
just
this
once
are
you
awfully
old
or
just
a
little
old
and
are
you
perfectly
bald
or
just
a
little
bald
it
is
very
difficult
thinking
about
you
in
the
abstract
like
a
theorem
in
geometry
given
a
tall
rich
man
who
hates
girls
but
is
very
generous
to
one
quite
impertinent
girl
what
does
he
look
like
december
dear
you
never
answered
my
question
and
it
was
very
important
are
you
bald
i
have
it
planned
exactly
what
you
look
like
very
satisfactorily
until
i
reach
the
top
of
your
head
and
then
i
am
stuck
i
ca
decide
whether
you
have
white
hair
or
black
hair
or
sort
of
sprinkly
grey
hair
or
maybe
none
at
all
here
is
your
portrait
but
the
problem
is
shall
i
add
some
hair
would
you
like
to
know
what
colour
your
eyes
are
they
grey
and
your
eyebrows
stick
out
like
a
porch
roof
beetling
they
called
in
novels
and
your
mouth
is
a
straight
line
with
a
tendency
to
turn
down
at
the
corners
oh
you
see
i
know
you
a
snappy
old
thing
with
a
temper
chapel
bell
i
have
a
new
unbreakable
rule
never
never
to
study
at
night
no
matter
how
many
written
reviews
are
coming
in
the
morning
instead
i
read
just
plain
books
i
have
to
you
know
because
there
are
eighteen
blank
years
behind
me
you
would
believe
daddy
what
an
abyss
of
ignorance
my
mind
is
i
am
just
realizing
the
depths
myself
the
things
that
most
girls
with
a
properly
assorted
family
and
a
home
and
friends
and
a
library
know
by
absorption
i
have
never
heard
of
for
example
i
never
read
mother
goose
or
david
copperfield
or
ivanhoe
or
cinderella
or
blue
beard
or
robinson
crusoe
or
jane
eyre
or
alice
in
wonderland
or
a
word
of
rudyard
kipling
i
did
know
that
henry
the
eighth
was
married
more
than
once
or
that
shelley
was
a
poet
i
did
know
that
people
used
to
be
monkeys
and
that
the
garden
of
eden
was
a
beautiful
myth
i
did
know
that
stood
for
robert
louis
stevenson
or
that
george
eliot
was
a
lady
i
had
never
seen
a
picture
of
the
lisa
and
it
true
but
you
wo
believe
it
i
had
never
heard
of
sherlock
holmes
now
i
know
all
of
these
things
and
a
lot
of
others
besides
but
you
can
see
how
much
i
need
to
catch
up
and
oh
but
it
fun
i
look
forward
all
day
to
evening
and
then
i
put
an
on
the
door
and
get
into
my
nice
red
bath
robe
and
furry
slippers
and
pile
all
the
cushions
behind
me
on
the
couch
and
light
the
brass
student
lamp
at
my
elbow
and
read
and
read
and
read
one
book
is
enough
i
have
four
going
at
once
just
now
they
tennyson
poems
and
vanity
fair
and
kipling
plain
tales
and
do
laugh
little
women
i
find
that
i
am
the
only
girl
in
college
who
was
brought
up
on
little
women
i
have
told
anybody
though
that
would
stamp
me
as
queer
i
just
quietly
went
and
bought
it
with
of
my
last
month
allowance
and
the
next
time
somebody
mentions
pickled
limes
i
know
what
she
is
talking
about
ten
bell
this
is
a
very
interrupted
letter
saturday
sir
i
have
the
honour
to
report
fresh
explorations
in
the
field
of
geometry
on
friday
last
we
abandoned
our
former
works
in
parallelopipeds
and
proceeded
to
truncated
prisms
we
are
finding
the
road
rough
and
very
uphill
sunday
the
christmas
holidays
begin
next
week
and
the
trunks
are
up
the
corridors
are
so
filled
up
that
you
can
hardly
get
through
and
everybody
is
so
bubbling
over
with
excitement
that
studying
is
getting
left
out
i
going
to
have
a
beautiful
time
in
vacation
another
freshman
who
lives
in
texas
staying
behind
and
we
are
planning
to
take
long
walks
and
if
there
any
ice
learn
to
skate
then
there
is
still
the
whole
library
to
be
read
and
three
empty
weeks
to
do
it
in
goodbye
daddy
i
hope
that
you
are
feeling
as
happy
as
i
am
yours
ever
judy
ps
do
forget
to
answer
my
question
if
you
do
want
the
trouble
of
writing
have
your
secretary
telegraph
he
can
just
say
smith
is
quite
bald
or
smith
is
not
bald
or
smith
has
white
hair
and
you
can
deduct
the
cents
out
of
my
allowance
goodbye
till
january
and
a
merry
christmas
towards
the
end
of
the
christmas
vacation
exact
date
unknown
dear
is
it
snowing
where
you
are
all
the
world
that
i
see
from
my
tower
is
draped
in
white
and
the
flakes
are
coming
down
as
big
as
it
late
afternoon
the
sun
is
just
setting
a
cold
yellow
colour
behind
some
colder
violet
hills
and
i
am
up
in
my
window
seat
using
the
last
light
to
write
to
you
your
five
gold
pieces
were
a
surprise
i
not
used
to
receiving
christmas
presents
you
have
already
given
me
such
lots
of
things
everything
i
have
you
know
that
i
do
quite
feel
that
i
deserve
extras
but
i
like
them
just
the
same
do
you
want
to
know
what
i
bought
with
my
money
i
a
silver
watch
in
a
leather
case
to
wear
on
my
wrist
and
get
me
to
recitations
in
time

matthew

iii
a

iv
a

my

is
cold
five
hundred
sheets
of
yellow
manuscript
paper
i
going
to
commence
being
an
author
pretty
soon
vi
a
dictionary
of
synonyms
to
enlarge
the
author
vocabulary
vii
i
do
much
like
to
confess
this
last
item
but
i
will
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
and
now
daddy
never
say
i
do
tell
all
it
was
a
very
low
motive
if
you
must
know
it
that
prompted
the
silk
stockings
julia
pendleton
comes
into
my
room
to
do
geometry
and
she
sits
on
the
couch
and
wears
silk
stockings
every
night
but
just
wait
as
soon
as
she
gets
back
from
vacation
i
shall
go
in
and
sit
on
her
couch
in
my
silk
stockings
you
see
daddy
the
miserable
creature
that
i
am
but
at
least
i
honest
and
you
knew
already
from
my
asylum
record
that
i
was
perfect
did
you
to
recapitulate
that
the
way
the
english
instructor
begins
every
other
sentence
i
am
very
much
obliged
for
my
seven
presents
pretending
to
myself
that
they
came
in
a
box
from
my
family
in
california
the
watch
is
from
father
the
rug
from
mother
the
hot
water
bottle
from
grandmother
who
is
always
worrying
for
fear
i
shall
catch
cold
in
this
climate
and
the
yellow
paper
from
my
little
brother
harry
my
sister
isabel
gave
me
the
silk
stockings
and
aunt
susan
the
matthew
arnold
poems
uncle
harry
little
harry
is
named
after
him
gave
me
the
dictionary
he
wanted
to
send
chocolates
but
i
insisted
on
synonyms
you
do
object
do
you
to
playing
the
part
of
a
composite
family
and
now
shall
i
tell
you
about
my
vacation
or
are
you
only
interested
in
my
education
as
such
i
hope
you
appreciate
the
delicate
shade
of
meaning
in
such
it
is
the
latest
addition
to
my
vocabulary
the
girl
from
texas
is
named
leonora
fenton
almost
as
funny
as
jerusha
is
it
i
like
her
but
not
so
much
as
sallie
mcbride
i
shall
never
like
any
one
so
much
as
sallie
except
you
i
must
always
like
you
the
best
of
all
because
you
my
whole
family
rolled
into
one
leonora
and
i
and
two
sophomores
have
walked
country
every
pleasant
day
and
explored
the
whole
neighbourhood
dressed
in
short
skirts
and
knit
jackets
and
caps
and
carrying
shiny
sticks
to
whack
things
with
once
we
walked
into
town
four
miles
and
stopped
at
a
restaurant
where
the
college
girls
go
for
dinner
broiled
lobster
cents
and
for
dessert
buckwheat
cakes
and
maple
syrup
cents
nourishing
and
cheap
it
was
such
a
lark
especially
for
me
because
it
was
so
awfully
different
from
the
asylum
i
feel
like
an
escaped
convict
every
time
i
leave
the
campus
before
i
thought
i
started
to
tell
the
others
what
an
experience
i
was
having
the
cat
was
almost
out
of
the
bag
when
i
grabbed
it
by
its
tail
and
pulled
it
back
it
awfully
hard
for
me
not
to
tell
everything
i
know
i
a
very
confiding
soul
by
nature
if
i
did
have
you
to
tell
things
to
i
burst
we
had
a
molasses
candy
pull
last
friday
evening
given
by
the
house
matron
of
fergussen
to
the
in
the
other
halls
there
were
of
us
altogether
freshmen
and
sophomores
and
juniors
and
seniors
all
united
in
amicable
accord
the
kitchen
is
huge
with
copper
pots
and
kettles
hanging
in
rows
on
the
stone
wall
the
littlest
casserole
among
them
about
the
size
of
a
wash
boiler
four
hundred
girls
live
in
fergussen
the
chef
in
a
white
cap
and
apron
fetched
out
other
white
caps
and
aprons
i
ca
imagine
where
he
got
so
many
and
we
all
turned
ourselves
into
cooks
it
was
great
fun
though
i
have
seen
better
candy
when
it
was
finally
finished
and
ourselves
and
the
kitchen
and
the
all
thoroughly
sticky
we
organized
a
procession
and
still
in
our
caps
and
aprons
each
carrying
a
big
fork
or
spoon
or
frying
pan
we
marched
through
the
empty
corridors
to
the
officers
parlour
where
professors
and
instructors
were
passing
a
tranquil
evening
we
serenaded
them
with
college
songs
and
offered
refreshments
they
accepted
politely
but
dubiously
we
left
them
sucking
chunks
of
molasses
candy
sticky
and
speechless
so
you
see
daddy
my
education
progresses
do
you
really
think
that
i
ought
to
be
an
artist
instead
of
an
author
vacation
will
be
over
in
two
days
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
the
girls
again
my
tower
is
just
a
trifle
lonely
when
nine
people
occupy
a
house
that
was
built
for
four
hundred
they
do
rattle
around
a
bit
eleven
pages
poor
daddy
you
must
be
tired
i
meant
this
to
be
just
a
short
little
note
but
when
i
get
started
i
seem
to
have
a
ready
pen
goodbye
and
thank
you
for
thinking
of
me
i
should
be
perfectly
happy
except
for
one
little
threatening
cloud
on
the
horizon
examinations
come
in
february
yours
with
love
judy
ps
maybe
it
is
proper
to
send
love
if
it
is
please
excuse
but
i
must
love
somebody
and
there
only
you
and
lippett
to
choose
between
so
you
see
you
have
to
put
up
with
it
daddy
dear
because
i
ca
love
her
on
the
eve
dear
you
should
see
the
way
this
college
is
studying
we
forgotten
we
ever
had
a
vacation
irregular
verbs
have
i
introduced
to
my
brain
in
the
past
four
days
i
only
hoping
they
stay
till
after
examinations
some
of
the
girls
sell
their
when
they
through
with
them
but
i
intend
to
keep
mine
then
after
i
graduated
i
shall
have
my
whole
education
in
a
row
in
the
bookcase
and
when
i
need
to
use
any
detail
i
can
turn
to
it
without
the
slightest
hesitation
so
much
easier
and
more
accurate
than
trying
to
keep
it
in
your
head
julia
pendleton
dropped
in
this
evening
to
pay
a
social
call
and
stayed
a
solid
hour
she
got
started
on
the
subject
of
family
and
i
could
switch
her
off
she
wanted
to
know
what
my
mother
maiden
name
was
did
you
ever
hear
such
an
impertinent
question
to
ask
of
a
person
from
a
foundling
asylum
i
did
have
the
courage
to
say
i
did
know
so
i
just
miserably
plumped
on
the
first
name
i
could
think
of
and
that
was
montgomery
then
she
wanted
to
know
whether
i
belonged
to
the
massachusetts
montgomerys
or
the
virginia
montgomerys
her
mother
was
a
rutherford
the
family
came
over
in
the
ark
and
were
connected
by
marriage
with
henry
the
viii
on
her
father
side
they
date
back
further
than
adam
on
the
topmost
branches
of
her
family
tree
there
a
superior
breed
of
monkeys
with
very
fine
silky
hair
and
extra
long
tails
i
meant
to
write
you
a
nice
cheerful
entertaining
letter
tonight
but
i
too
sleepy
and
scared
the
freshman
lot
is
not
a
happy
one
yours
about
to
be
examined
judy
abbott
sunday
dearest
i
have
some
awful
awful
awful
news
to
tell
you
but
i
wo
begin
with
it
i
try
to
get
you
in
a
good
humour
first
jerusha
abbott
has
commenced
to
be
an
author
a
poem
entitled
my
tower
appears
in
the
february
monthly
on
the
first
page
which
is
a
very
great
honour
for
a
freshman
my
english
instructor
stopped
me
on
the
way
out
from
chapel
last
night
and
said
it
was
a
charming
piece
of
work
except
for
the
sixth
line
which
had
too
many
feet
i
will
send
you
a
copy
in
case
you
care
to
read
it
let
me
see
if
i
ca
think
of
something
else
pleasant
oh
yes
learning
to
skate
and
can
glide
about
quite
respectably
all
by
myself
also
i
learned
how
to
slide
down
a
rope
from
the
roof
of
the
gymnasium
and
i
can
vault
a
bar
three
feet
and
six
inches
high
i
hope
shortly
to
pull
up
to
four
feet
we
had
a
very
inspiring
sermon
this
morning
preached
by
the
bishop
of
alabama
his
text
was
not
that
ye
be
not
judged
it
was
about
the
necessity
of
overlooking
mistakes
in
others
and
not
discouraging
people
by
harsh
judgments
i
wish
you
might
have
heard
it
this
is
the
sunniest
most
blinding
winter
afternoon
with
icicles
dripping
from
the
fir
trees
and
all
the
world
bending
under
a
weight
of
snow
except
me
and
i
bending
under
a
weight
of
sorrow
now
for
the
news
courage
judy
you
must
tell
are
you
surely
in
a
good
humour
i
failed
in
mathematics
and
latin
prose
i
am
tutoring
in
them
and
will
take
another
examination
next
month
i
sorry
if
you
disappointed
but
otherwise
i
do
care
a
bit
because
i
learned
such
a
lot
of
things
not
mentioned
in
the
catalogue
i
read
seventeen
novels
and
bushels
of
poetry
really
necessary
novels
like
vanity
fair
and
richard
feverel
and
alice
in
wonderland
also
emerson
essays
and
lockhart
life
of
scott
and
the
first
volume
of
gibbon
roman
empire
and
half
of
benvenuto
life
was
he
entertaining
he
used
to
saunter
out
and
casually
kill
a
man
before
breakfast
so
you
see
daddy
i
much
more
intelligent
than
if
i
just
stuck
to
latin
will
you
forgive
me
this
once
if
i
promise
never
to
fail
again
yours
in
sackcloth
judy
dear
this
is
an
extra
letter
in
the
middle
of
the
month
because
i
rather
lonely
tonight
it
awfully
stormy
all
the
lights
are
out
on
the
campus
but
i
drank
black
coffee
and
i
ca
go
to
sleep
i
had
a
supper
party
this
evening
consisting
of
sallie
and
julia
and
leonora
fenton
and
sardines
and
toasted
muffins
and
salad
and
fudge
and
coffee
julia
said
she
had
a
good
time
but
sallie
stayed
to
help
wash
the
dishes
i
might
very
usefully
put
some
time
on
latin
tonight
but
there
no
doubt
about
it
i
a
very
languid
latin
scholar
we
finished
livy
and
de
senectute
and
are
now
engaged
with
de
amicitia
pronounced
damn
icitia
should
you
mind
just
for
a
little
while
pretending
you
are
my
grandmother
sallie
has
one
and
julia
and
leonora
each
two
and
they
were
all
comparing
them
tonight
i
ca
think
of
anything
i
rather
have
it
such
a
respectable
relationship
so
if
you
really
object
when
i
went
into
town
yesterday
i
saw
the
sweetest
cap
of
cluny
lace
trimmed
with
lavender
ribbon
i
am
going
to
make
you
a
present
of
it
on
your
birthday
that
the
clock
in
the
chapel
tower
striking
twelve
i
believe
i
am
sleepy
after
all
good
night
granny
i
love
you
dearly
judy
the
ides
of
march
dear
i
am
studying
latin
prose
composition
i
have
been
studying
it
i
shall
be
studying
it
i
shall
be
about
to
have
been
studying
it
my
comes
the
hour
next
tuesday
and
i
am
going
to
pass
or
bust
so
you
may
expect
to
hear
from
me
next
whole
and
happy
and
free
from
conditions
or
in
fragments
i
will
write
a
respectable
letter
when
it
over
tonight
i
have
a
pressing
engagement
with
the
ablative
absolute
yours
in
evident
haste
j
a
march
smith
sir
you
never
answer
any
questions
you
never
show
the
slightest
interest
in
anything
i
do
you
are
probably
the
horridest
one
of
all
those
horrid
trustees
and
the
reason
you
are
educating
me
is
not
because
you
care
a
bit
about
me
but
from
a
sense
of
duty
i
do
know
a
single
thing
about
you
i
do
even
know
your
name
it
is
very
uninspiring
writing
to
a
thing
i
have
a
doubt
but
that
you
throw
my
letters
into
the
without
reading
them
hereafter
i
shall
write
only
about
work
my
in
latin
and
geometry
came
last
week
i
passed
them
both
and
am
now
free
from
conditions
yours
truly
jerusha
abbott
april
dear
i
am
a
beast
please
forget
about
that
dreadful
letter
i
sent
you
last
week
i
was
feeling
terribly
lonely
and
miserable
and
the
night
i
wrote
i
did
know
it
but
i
was
just
sickening
for
tonsillitis
and
grippe
and
lots
of
things
mixed
i
in
the
infirmary
now
and
have
been
here
for
six
days
this
is
the
first
time
they
would
let
me
sit
up
and
have
a
pen
and
paper
the
head
nurse
is
very
bossy
but
i
been
thinking
about
it
all
the
time
and
i
sha
get
well
until
you
forgive
me
here
is
a
picture
of
the
way
i
look
with
a
bandage
tied
around
my
head
in
rabbit
ears
does
that
arouse
your
sympathy
i
am
having
sublingual
gland
swelling
and
i
been
studying
physiology
all
the
year
without
ever
hearing
of
sublingual
glands
how
futile
a
thing
is
education
i
ca
write
any
more
i
get
rather
shaky
when
i
sit
up
too
long
please
forgive
me
for
being
impertinent
and
ungrateful
i
was
badly
brought
up
yours
with
love
judy
abbott
the
infirmary
april
dearest
yesterday
evening
just
towards
dark
when
i
was
sitting
up
in
bed
looking
out
at
the
rain
and
feeling
awfully
bored
with
life
in
a
great
institution
the
nurse
appeared
with
a
long
white
box
addressed
to
me
and
filled
with
the
loveliest
pink
rosebuds
and
much
nicer
still
it
contained
a
card
with
a
very
polite
message
written
in
a
funny
little
uphill
back
hand
but
one
which
shows
a
great
deal
of
character
thank
you
daddy
a
thousand
times
your
flowers
make
the
first
real
true
present
i
ever
received
in
my
life
if
you
want
to
know
what
a
baby
i
am
i
lay
down
and
cried
because
i
was
so
happy
now
that
i
am
sure
you
read
my
letters
i
make
them
much
more
interesting
so
they
be
worth
keeping
in
a
safe
with
red
tape
around
them
only
please
take
out
that
dreadful
one
and
burn
it
up
i
hate
to
think
that
you
ever
read
it
over
thank
you
for
making
a
very
sick
cross
miserable
freshman
cheerful
probably
you
have
lots
of
loving
family
and
friends
and
you
do
know
what
it
feels
like
to
be
alone
but
i
do
goodbye
i
promise
never
to
be
horrid
again
because
now
i
know
you
a
real
person
also
i
promise
never
to
bother
you
with
any
more
questions
do
you
still
hate
girls
yours
for
ever
judy
hour
monday
dear
i
hope
you
are
the
trustee
who
sat
on
the
toad
it
went
off
i
was
told
with
quite
a
pop
so
probably
he
was
a
fatter
trustee
do
you
remember
the
little
dugout
places
with
gratings
over
them
by
the
laundry
windows
in
the
john
grier
home
every
spring
when
the
hoptoad
season
opened
we
used
to
form
a
collection
of
toads
and
keep
them
in
those
window
holes
and
occasionally
they
would
spill
over
into
the
laundry
causing
a
very
pleasurable
commotion
on
wash
days
we
were
severely
punished
for
our
activities
in
this
direction
but
in
spite
of
all
discouragement
the
toads
would
collect
and
one
day
well
i
wo
bore
you
with
particulars
but
somehow
one
of
the
fattest
biggest
juciest
toads
got
into
one
of
those
big
leather
arm
chairs
in
the
trustees
room
and
that
afternoon
at
the
trustees
meeting
but
i
dare
say
you
were
there
and
recall
the
rest
looking
back
dispassionately
after
a
period
of
time
i
will
say
that
punishment
was
merited
and
if
i
remember
rightly
adequate
i
do
know
why
i
am
in
such
a
reminiscent
mood
except
that
spring
and
the
reappearance
of
toads
always
awakens
the
old
acquisitive
instinct
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
from
starting
a
collection
is
the
fact
that
no
rule
exists
against
it
after
chapel
thursday
what
do
you
think
is
my
favourite
book
just
now
i
mean
i
change
every
three
days
wuthering
heights
emily
bronte
was
quite
young
when
she
wrote
it
and
had
never
been
outside
of
haworth
churchyard
she
had
never
known
any
men
in
her
life
how
could
she
imagine
a
man
like
heathcliffe
i
could
do
it
and
i
quite
young
and
never
outside
the
john
grier
asylum
i
had
every
chance
in
the
world
sometimes
a
dreadful
fear
comes
over
me
that
i
not
a
genius
will
you
be
awfully
disappointed
daddy
if
i
do
turn
out
to
be
a
great
author
in
the
spring
when
everything
is
so
beautiful
and
green
and
budding
i
feel
like
turning
my
back
on
lessons
and
running
away
to
play
with
the
weather
there
are
such
lots
of
adventures
out
in
the
fields
it
much
more
entertaining
to
live
books
than
to
write
them
ow
that
was
a
shriek
which
brought
sallie
and
julia
and
for
a
disgusted
moment
the
senior
from
across
the
hall
it
was
caused
by
a
centipede
like
this
only
worse
just
as
i
had
finished
the
last
sentence
and
was
thinking
what
to
say
next
plump
it
fell
off
the
ceiling
and
landed
at
my
side
i
tipped
two
cups
off
the
tea
table
in
trying
to
get
away
sallie
whacked
it
with
the
back
of
my
hair
brush
which
i
shall
never
be
able
to
use
again
and
killed
the
front
end
but
the
rear
fifty
feet
ran
under
the
bureau
and
escaped
this
dormitory
owing
to
its
age
and
walls
is
full
of
centipedes
they
are
dreadful
creatures
i
rather
find
a
tiger
under
the
bed
friday
such
a
lot
of
troubles
i
did
hear
the
rising
bell
this
morning
then
i
broke
my
shoestring
while
i
was
hurrying
to
dress
and
dropped
my
collar
button
down
my
neck
i
was
late
for
breakfast
and
also
for
recitation
i
forgot
to
take
any
blotting
paper
and
my
fountain
pen
leaked
in
trigonometry
the
professor
and
i
had
a
disagreement
touching
a
little
matter
of
logarithms
on
looking
it
up
i
find
that
she
was
right
we
had
mutton
stew
and
for
lunch
hate
both
they
taste
like
the
asylum
the
post
brought
me
nothing
but
bills
though
i
must
say
that
i
never
do
get
anything
else
my
family
are
not
the
kind
that
write
in
english
class
this
afternoon
we
had
an
unexpected
written
lesson
this
was
it
i
asked
no
other
thing
no
other
was
denied
i
offered
being
for
it
the
mighty
merchant
smiled
brazil
he
twirled
a
button
without
a
glance
my
way
but
madam
is
there
nothing
else
that
we
can
show
today
that
is
a
poem
i
do
know
who
wrote
it
or
what
it
means
it
was
simply
printed
out
on
the
blackboard
when
we
arrived
and
we
were
ordered
to
comment
upon
it
when
i
read
the
first
verse
i
thought
i
had
an
idea
the
mighty
merchant
was
a
divinity
who
distributes
blessings
in
return
for
virtuous
deeds
but
when
i
got
to
the
second
verse
and
found
him
twirling
a
button
it
seemed
a
blasphemous
supposition
and
i
hastily
changed
my
mind
the
rest
of
the
class
was
in
the
same
predicament
and
there
we
sat
for
of
an
hour
with
blank
paper
and
equally
blank
minds
getting
an
education
is
an
awfully
wearing
process
but
this
did
end
the
day
there
worse
to
come
it
rained
so
we
could
play
golf
but
had
to
go
to
gymnasium
instead
the
girl
next
to
me
banged
my
elbow
with
an
indian
club
i
got
home
to
find
that
the
box
with
my
new
blue
spring
dress
had
come
and
the
skirt
was
so
tight
that
i
could
sit
down
friday
is
sweeping
day
and
the
maid
had
mixed
all
the
papers
on
my
desk
we
had
tombstone
for
dessert
milk
and
gelatin
flavoured
with
vanilla
we
were
kept
in
chapel
twenty
minutes
later
than
usual
to
listen
to
a
speech
about
womanly
women
and
then
just
as
i
was
settling
down
with
a
sigh
of
relief
to
the
portrait
of
a
lady
a
girl
named
ackerly
a
deadly
unintermittently
stupid
girl
who
sits
next
to
me
in
latin
because
her
name
begins
with
a
i
wish
lippett
had
named
me
zabriski
came
to
ask
if
monday
lesson
commenced
at
paragraph
or
and
stayed
one
hour
she
has
just
gone
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
discouraging
series
of
events
it
the
big
troubles
in
life
that
require
character
anybody
can
rise
to
a
crisis
and
face
a
crushing
tragedy
with
courage
but
to
meet
the
petty
hazards
of
the
day
with
a
laugh
i
really
think
that
requires
spirit
it
the
kind
of
character
that
i
am
going
to
develop
i
am
going
to
pretend
that
all
life
is
just
a
game
which
i
must
play
as
skilfully
and
fairly
as
i
can
if
i
lose
i
am
going
to
shrug
my
shoulders
and
laugh
also
if
i
win
anyway
i
am
going
to
be
a
sport
you
will
never
hear
me
complain
again
daddy
dear
because
julia
wears
silk
stockings
and
centipedes
drop
off
the
wall
yours
ever
judy
answer
soon
may
esq
dear
sir
i
am
in
receipt
of
a
letter
from
lippett

hopes
that
i
am
doing
well
in
deportment
and
studies
since
i
probably
have
no
place
to
go
this
summer
she
will
let
me
come
back
to
the
asylum
and
work
for
my
board
until
college
opens
i
hate
the
john
grier
home

je
vous
aime
beaucoup
judy
may
dear
did
you
ever
see
this
campus
that
is
merely
a
rhetorical
question
do
let
it
annoy
you
it
is
a
heavenly
spot
in
may
all
the
shrubs
are
in
blossom
and
the
trees
are
the
loveliest
young
green
even
the
old
pines
look
fresh
and
new
the
grass
is
dotted
with
yellow
dandelions
and
hundreds
of
girls
in
blue
and
white
and
pink
dresses
everybody
is
joyous
and
carefree
for
vacation
coming
and
with
that
to
look
forward
to
examinations
do
count
is
that
a
happy
frame
of
mind
to
be
in
and
oh
daddy
i
the
happiest
of
all
because
i
not
in
the
asylum
any
more
and
i
not
anybody
nursemaid
or
typewriter
or
bookkeeper
i
should
have
been
you
know
except
for
you
i
sorry
now
for
all
my
past
badnesses
i
sorry
i
was
ever
impertinent
to
lippett
i
sorry
i
ever
slapped
freddie
perkins
i
sorry
i
ever
filled
the
sugar
bowl
with
salt
i
sorry
i
ever
made
faces
behind
the
trustees
backs
i
going
to
be
good
and
sweet
and
kind
to
everybody
because
i
so
happy
and
this
summer
i
going
to
write
and
write
and
write
and
begin
to
be
a
great
author
is
that
an
exalted
stand
to
take
oh
i
developing
a
beautiful
character
it
droops
a
bit
under
cold
and
frost
but
it
does
grow
fast
when
the
sun
shines
that
the
way
with
everybody
i
do
agree
with
the
theory
that
adversity
and
sorrow
and
disappointment
develop
moral
strength
the
happy
people
are
the
ones
who
are
bubbling
over
with
kindliness
i
have
no
faith
in
misanthropes
fine
word
just
learned
it
you
are
not
a
misanthrope
are
you
daddy
i
started
to
tell
you
about
the
campus
i
wish
you
come
for
a
little
visit
and
let
me
walk
you
about
and
say
is
the
library
this
is
the
gas
plant
daddy
dear
the
gothic
building
on
your
left
is
the
gymnasium
and
the
tudor
romanesque
beside
it
is
the
new
infirmary
oh
i
fine
at
showing
people
about
i
done
it
all
my
life
at
the
asylum
and
i
been
doing
it
all
day
here
i
have
honestly
and
a
man
too
that
a
great
experience
i
never
talked
to
a
man
before
except
occasional
trustees
and
they
do
count
pardon
daddy
i
do
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
when
i
abuse
trustees
i
do
consider
that
you
really
belong
among
them
you
just
tumbled
on
to
the
board
by
chance
the
trustee
as
such
is
fat
and
pompous
and
benevolent
he
pats
one
on
the
head
and
wears
a
gold
watch
chain
that
looks
like
a
june
bug
but
is
meant
to
be
a
portrait
of
any
trustee
except
you
however
to
resume
i
have
been
walking
and
talking
and
having
tea
with
a
man
and
with
a
very
superior
man
with
jervis
pendleton
of
the
house
of
julia
her
uncle
in
short
in
long
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
he
as
tall
as
you
being
in
town
on
business
he
decided
to
run
out
to
the
college
and
call
on
his
niece
he
her
father
youngest
brother
but
she
know
him
very
intimately
it
seems
he
glanced
at
her
when
she
was
a
baby
decided
he
did
like
her
and
has
never
noticed
her
since
anyway
there
he
was
sitting
in
the
reception
room
very
proper
with
his
hat
and
stick
and
gloves
beside
him
and
julia
and
sallie
with
recitations
that
they
could
cut
so
julia
dashed
into
my
room
and
begged
me
to
walk
him
about
the
campus
and
then
deliver
him
to
her
when
the
seventh
hour
was
over
i
said
i
would
obligingly
but
unenthusiastically
because
i
do
care
much
for
pendletons
but
he
turned
out
to
be
a
sweet
lamb
he
a
real
human
being
not
a
pendleton
at
all
we
had
a
beautiful
time
i
longed
for
an
uncle
ever
since
do
you
mind
pretending
you
my
uncle
i
believe
superior
to
grandmothers
pendleton
reminded
me
a
little
of
you
daddy
as
you
were
twenty
years
ago
you
see
i
know
you
intimately
even
if
we
have
ever
met
he
tall
and
thinnish
with
a
dark
face
all
over
lines
and
the
funniest
underneath
smile
that
never
quite
comes
through
but
just
wrinkles
up
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
he
has
a
way
of
making
you
feel
right
off
as
though
you
known
him
a
long
time
he
very
companionable
we
walked
all
over
the
campus
from
the
quadrangle
to
the
athletic
grounds
then
he
said
he
felt
weak
and
must
have
some
tea
he
proposed
that
we
go
to
college
inn
it
just
off
the
campus
by
the
pine
walk
i
said
we
ought
to
go
back
for
julia
and
sallie
but
he
said
he
like
to
have
his
nieces
drink
too
much
tea
it
made
them
nervous
so
we
just
ran
away
and
had
tea
and
muffins
and
marmalade
and
and
cake
at
a
nice
little
table
out
on
the
balcony
the
inn
was
quite
conveniently
empty
this
being
the
end
of
the
month
and
allowances
low
we
had
the
jolliest
time
but
he
had
to
run
for
his
train
the
minute
he
got
back
and
he
barely
saw
julia
at
all
she
was
furious
with
me
for
taking
him
off
it
seems
he
an
unusually
rich
and
desirable
uncle
it
relieved
my
mind
to
find
he
was
rich
for
the
tea
and
things
cost
sixty
cents
apiece
this
morning
it
monday
now
three
boxes
of
chocolates
came
by
express
for
julia
and
sallie
and
me
what
do
you
think
of
that
to
be
getting
candy
from
a
man
i
begin
to
feel
like
a
girl
instead
of
a
foundling
i
wish
you
come
and
have
tea
some
day
and
let
me
see
if
i
like
you
but
would
it
be
dreadful
if
i
did
however
i
know
i
should
bien
i
make
you
my
compliments
je
ne
judy
ps
i
looked
in
the
glass
this
morning
and
found
a
perfectly
new
dimple
that
i
never
seen
before
it
very
curious
where
do
you
suppose
it
came
from
june
dear
happy
day
i
just
finished
my
last
examination
physiology
and
now
three
months
on
a
farm
i
do
know
what
kind
of
a
thing
a
farm
is
i
never
been
on
one
in
my
life
i
never
even
looked
at
one
except
from
the
car
window
but
i
know
i
going
to
love
it
and
i
going
to
love
being
free
i
am
not
used
even
yet
to
being
outside
the
john
grier
home
whenever
i
think
of
it
excited
little
thrills
chase
up
and
down
my
back
i
feel
as
though
i
must
run
faster
and
faster
and
keep
looking
over
my
shoulder
to
make
sure
that
lippett
is
after
me
with
her
arm
stretched
out
to
grab
me
back
i
do
have
to
mind
any
one
this
summer
do
i
your
nominal
authority
does
annoy
me
in
the
least
you
are
too
far
away
to
do
any
harm
lippett
is
dead
for
ever
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
the
semples
are
expected
to
overlook
my
moral
welfare
are
they
no
i
am
sure
not
i
am
entirely
grown
up
hooray

leave
you

trunk

boxes
of
teakettles
and
dishes

willow
farm
saturday
night
dearest
i
only
just
come
and
i
not
unpacked
but
i
ca
wait
to
tell
you
how
much
i
like
farms
this
is
a
heavenly
heavenly
heavenly
spot
the
house
is
square
like
this
and
old
a
hundred
years
or
so
it
has
a
veranda
on
the
side
which
i
ca
draw
and
a
sweet
porch
in
front
the
picture
really
does
do
it
justice
those
things
that
look
like
feather
dusters
are
maple
trees
and
the
prickly
ones
that
border
the
drive
are
murmuring
pines
and
hemlocks
it
stands
on
the
top
of
a
hill
and
looks
way
off
over
miles
of
green
meadows
to
another
line
of
hills
that
is
the
way
connecticut
goes
in
a
series
of
marcelle
waves
and
lock
willow
farm
is
just
on
the
crest
of
one
wave
the
barns
used
to
be
across
the
road
where
they
obstructed
the
view
but
a
kind
flash
of
lightning
came
from
heaven
and
burnt
them
down
the
people
are
and
semple
and
a
hired
girl
and
two
hired
men
the
hired
people
eat
in
the
kitchen
and
the
semples
and
judy
in
the
we
had
ham
and
eggs
and
biscuits
and
honey
and
and
pie
and
pickles
and
cheese
and
tea
for
supper
and
a
great
deal
of
conversation
i
have
never
been
so
entertaining
in
my
life
everything
i
say
appears
to
be
funny
i
suppose
it
is
because
i
never
been
in
the
country
before
and
my
questions
are
backed
by
an
ignorance
the
room
marked
with
a
cross
is
not
where
the
murder
was
committed
but
the
one
that
i
occupy
it
big
and
square
and
empty
with
adorable
furniture
and
windows
that
have
to
be
propped
up
on
sticks
and
green
shades
trimmed
with
gold
that
fall
down
if
you
touch
them
and
a
big
square
mahogany
table
i
going
to
spend
the
summer
with
my
elbows
spread
out
on
it
writing
a
novel
oh
daddy
i
so
excited
i
ca
wait
till
daylight
to
explore
it
now
and
i
am
about
to
blow
out
my
candle
and
try
to
go
to
sleep
we
rise
at
five
did
you
ever
know
such
fun
i
ca
believe
this
is
really
judy
you
and
the
good
lord
give
me
more
than
i
deserve
i
must
be
a
very
very
very
good
person
to
pay
i
going
to
be
you
see
good
night
judy
ps
you
should
hear
the
frogs
sing
and
the
little
pigs
squeal
and
you
should
see
the
new
moon
i
saw
it
over
my
right
shoulder
lock
willow
july
dear
how
did
your
secretary
come
to
know
about
lock
willow
that
is
a
rhetorical
question
i
am
awfully
curious
to
know
for
listen
to
this
jervis
pendleton
used
to
own
this
farm
but
now
he
has
given
it
to
semple
who
was
his
old
nurse
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
funny
coincidence
she
still
calls
him
jervie
and
talks
about
what
a
sweet
little
boy
he
used
to
be
she
has
one
of
his
baby
curls
put
away
in
a
box
and
it
is
red
or
at
least
reddish
since
she
discovered
that
i
know
him
i
have
risen
very
much
in
her
opinion
knowing
a
member
of
the
pendleton
family
is
the
best
introduction
one
can
have
at
lock
willow
and
the
cream
of
the
whole
family
is
master
jervis
i
am
pleased
to
say
that
julia
belongs
to
an
inferior
branch
the
farm
gets
more
and
more
entertaining
i
rode
on
a
hay
wagon
yesterday
we
have
three
big
pigs
and
nine
little
piglets
and
you
should
see
them
eat
they
are
pigs
we
oceans
of
little
baby
chickens
and
ducks
and
turkeys
and
guinea
fowls
you
must
be
mad
to
live
in
a
city
when
you
might
live
on
a
farm
it
is
my
daily
business
to
hunt
the
eggs
i
fell
off
a
beam
in
the
barn
loft
yesterday
while
i
was
trying
to
crawl
over
to
a
nest
that
the
black
hen
has
stolen
and
when
i
came
in
with
a
scratched
knee
semple
bound
it
up
with
murmuring
all
the
time
dear
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
master
jervie
fell
off
that
very
same
beam
and
scratched
this
very
same
knee
the
scenery
around
here
is
perfectly
beautiful
there
a
valley
and
a
river
and
a
lot
of
wooded
hills
and
way
in
the
distance
a
tall
blue
mountain
that
simply
melts
in
your
mouth
we
churn
twice
a
week
and
we
keep
the
cream
in
the
spring
house
which
is
made
of
stone
with
the
brook
running
underneath
some
of
the
farmers
around
here
have
a
separator
but
we
do
care
for
these
ideas
it
may
be
a
little
harder
to
separate
the
cream
in
pans
but
it
sufficiently
better
to
pay
we
have
six
calves
and
i
chosen
the
names
for
all
of
them
sylvia
because
she
was
born
in
the
woods
lesbia
after
the
lesbia
in
catullus
sallie
julia
a
spotted
nondescript
animal
judy
after
me
you
do
mind
do
you
daddy
he
pure
jersey
and
has
a
sweet
disposition
he
looks
like
this
you
can
see
how
appropriate
the
name
is
i
have
had
time
yet
to
begin
my
immortal
novel
the
farm
keeps
me
too
busy
yours
always
judy
ps
i
learned
to
make
doughnuts
ps
if
you
are
thinking
of
raising
chickens
let
me
recommend
buff
orpingtons
they
have
any
pin
feathers
ps
i
wish
i
could
send
you
a
pat
of
the
nice
fresh
butter
i
churned
yesterday
i
a
fine
ps
this
is
a
picture
of
miss
jerusha
abbott
the
future
great
author
driving
home
the
cows
sunday
dear
is
it
funny
i
started
to
write
to
you
yesterday
afternoon
but
as
far
as
i
got
was
the
heading
and
then
i
remembered
i
promised
to
pick
some
blackberries
for
supper
so
i
went
off
and
left
the
sheet
lying
on
the
table
and
when
i
came
back
today
what
do
you
think
i
found
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
page
a
real
true
i
picked
him
up
very
gently
by
one
leg
and
dropped
him
out
of
the
window
i
would
hurt
one
of
them
for
the
world
they
always
remind
me
of
you
we
hitched
up
the
spring
wagon
this
morning
and
drove
to
the
centre
to
church
it
a
sweet
little
white
frame
church
with
a
spire
and
three
doric
columns
in
front
or
maybe
ionic
i
always
get
them
mixed
a
nice
sleepy
sermon
with
everybody
drowsily
waving
fans
and
the
only
sound
aside
from
the
minister
the
buzzing
of
locusts
in
the
trees
outside
i
did
wake
up
till
i
found
myself
on
my
feet
singing
the
hymn
and
then
i
was
awfully
sorry
i
had
listened
to
the
sermon
i
should
like
to
know
more
of
the
psychology
of
a
man
who
would
pick
out
such
a
hymn
this
was
it
come
leave
your
sports
and
earthly
toys
and
join
me
in
celestial
joys
or
else
dear
friend
a
long
farewell
i
leave
you
now
to
sink
to
hell
i
find
that
it
is
safe
to
discuss
religion
with
the
semples
their
god
whom
they
have
inherited
intact
from
their
remote
puritan
ancestors
is
a
narrow
irrational
unjust
mean
revengeful
bigoted
person
thank
heaven
i
do
inherit
god
from
anybody
i
am
free
to
make
mine
up
as
i
wish
him
he
kind
and
sympathetic
and
imaginative
and
forgiving
and
understanding
and
he
has
a
sense
of
humour
i
like
the
semples
immensely
their
practice
is
so
superior
to
their
theory
they
are
better
than
their
own
god
i
told
them
so
and
they
are
horribly
troubled
they
think
i
am
blasphemous
and
i
think
they
are
we
dropped
theology
from
our
conversation
this
is
sunday
afternoon
amasai
hired
man
in
a
purple
tie
and
some
bright
yellow
buckskin
gloves
very
red
and
shaved
has
just
driven
off
with
carrie
hired
girl
in
a
big
hat
trimmed
with
red
roses
and
a
blue
muslin
dress
and
her
hair
curled
as
tight
as
it
will
curl
amasai
spent
all
the
morning
washing
the
buggy
and
carrie
stayed
home
from
church
ostensibly
to
cook
the
dinner
but
really
to
iron
the
muslin
dress
in
two
minutes
more
when
this
letter
is
finished
i
am
going
to
settle
down
to
a
book
which
i
found
in
the
attic
it
entitled
on
the
trail
and
sprawled
across
the
front
page
in
a
funny
hand
jervis
pendleton
if
this
book
should
ever
roam
box
its
ears
and
send
it
home
he
spent
the
summer
here
once
after
he
had
been
ill
when
he
was
about
eleven
years
old
and
he
left
on
the
trail
behind
it
looks
well
read
the
marks
of
his
grimy
little
hands
are
frequent
also
in
a
corner
of
the
attic
there
is
a
water
wheel
and
a
windmill
and
some
bows
and
arrows
semple
talks
so
constantly
about
him
that
i
begin
to
believe
he
really
lives
not
a
grown
man
with
a
silk
hat
and
walking
stick
but
a
nice
dirty
boy
who
clatters
up
the
stairs
with
an
awful
racket
and
leaves
the
screen
doors
open
and
is
always
asking
for
cookies
and
getting
them
too
if
i
know
mrs
semple
he
seems
to
have
been
an
adventurous
little
soul
and
brave
and
truthful
i
sorry
to
think
he
is
a
pendleton
he
was
meant
for
something
better
we
going
to
begin
threshing
oats
tomorrow
a
steam
engine
is
coming
and
three
extra
men
it
grieves
me
to
tell
you
that
buttercup
the
spotted
cow
with
one
horn
mother
of
lesbia
has
done
a
disgraceful
thing
she
got
into
the
orchard
friday
evening
and
ate
apples
under
the
trees
and
ate
and
ate
until
they
went
to
her
head
for
two
days
she
has
been
perfectly
dead
drunk
that
is
the
truth
i
am
telling
did
you
ever
hear
anything
so
scandalous
sir
i
remain
your
affectionate
orphan
judy
abbott
ps
indians
in
the
first
chapter
and
highwaymen
in
the
second
i
hold
my
breath
what
can
the
third
contain
hawk
leapt
twenty
feet
in
the
air
and
bit
the
dust
that
is
the
subject
of
the
frontispiece
are
judy
and
jervie
having
fun
september
dear
daddy
i
was
weighed
yesterday
on
the
flour
scales
in
the
general
store
at
the
comers
i
gained
nine
pounds
let
me
recommend
lock
willow
as
a
health
resort
yours
ever
judy
dear
behold
me
a
sophomore
i
came
up
last
friday
sorry
to
leave
lock
willow
but
glad
to
see
the
campus
again
it
is
a
pleasant
sensation
to
come
back
to
something
familiar
i
am
beginning
to
feel
at
home
in
college
and
in
command
of
the
situation
i
am
beginning
in
fact
to
feel
at
home
in
the
world
as
though
i
really
belonged
to
it
and
had
not
just
crept
in
on
sufferance
i
do
suppose
you
understand
in
the
least
what
i
am
trying
to
say
a
person
important
enough
to
be
a
trustee
ca
appreciate
the
feelings
of
a
person
unimportant
enough
to
be
a
foundling
and
now
daddy
listen
to
this
whom
do
you
think
i
am
rooming
with
sallie
mcbride
and
julia
rutledge
pendleton
it
the
truth
we
have
a
study
and
three
little
bedrooms
voila
sallie
and
i
decided
last
spring
that
we
should
like
to
room
together
and
julia
made
up
her
mind
to
stay
with
sallie
why
i
ca
imagine
for
they
are
not
a
bit
alike
but
the
pendletons
are
naturally
conservative
and
inimical
fine
word
to
change
anyway
here
we
are
think
of
jerusha
abbott
late
of
the
john
grier
home
for
orphans
rooming
with
a
pendleton
this
is
a
democratic
country
sallie
is
running
for
class
president
and
unless
all
signs
fail
she
is
going
to
be
elected
such
an
atmosphere
of
intrigue
you
should
see
what
politicians
we
are
oh
i
tell
you
daddy
when
we
women
get
our
rights
you
men
will
have
to
look
alive
in
order
to
keep
yours
election
comes
next
saturday
and
we
going
to
have
a
torchlight
procession
in
the
evening
no
matter
who
wins
i
am
beginning
chemistry
a
most
unusual
study
i
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
molecules
and
atoms
are
the
material
employed
but
i
be
in
a
position
to
discuss
them
more
definitely
next
month
i
am
also
taking
argumentation
and
logic
also
history
of
the
whole
world
also
plays
of
william
shakespeare
also
french
if
this
keeps
up
many
years
longer
i
shall
become
quite
intelligent
i
should
rather
have
elected
economics
than
french
but
i
did
dare
because
i
was
afraid
that
unless
i
french
the
professor
would
not
let
me
pass
as
it
was
i
just
managed
to
squeeze
through
the
june
examination
but
i
will
say
that
my
preparation
was
not
very
adequate
there
one
girl
in
the
class
who
chatters
away
in
french
as
fast
as
she
does
in
english
she
went
abroad
with
her
parents
when
she
was
a
child
and
spent
three
years
in
a
convent
school
you
can
imagine
how
bright
she
is
compared
with
the
rest
of
us
irregular
verbs
are
mere
playthings
i
wish
my
parents
had
chucked
me
into
a
french
convent
when
i
was
little
instead
of
a
foundling
asylum
oh
no
i
either
because
then
maybe
i
should
never
have
known
you
i
rather
know
you
than
french
goodbye
daddy
i
must
call
on
harriet
martin
now
and
having
discussed
the
chemical
situation
casually
drop
a
few
thoughts
on
the
subject
of
our
next
president
yours
in
politics
abbott
october
dear
supposing
the
swimming
tank
in
the
gymnasium
were
filled
full
of
lemon
jelly
could
a
person
trying
to
swim
manage
to
keep
on
top
or
would
he
sink
we
were
having
lemon
jelly
for
dessert
when
the
question
came
up
we
discussed
it
heatedly
for
half
an
hour
and
it
still
unsettled
sallie
thinks
that
she
could
swim
in
it
but
i
am
perfectly
sure
that
the
best
swimmer
in
the
world
would
sink
would
it
be
funny
to
be
drowned
in
lemon
jelly
two
other
problems
are
engaging
the
attention
of
our
table
what
shape
are
the
rooms
in
an
octagon
house
some
of
the
girls
insist
that
they
square
but
i
think
they
have
to
be
shaped
like
a
piece
of
pie
do
you
suppose
there
were
a
great
big
hollow
sphere
made
of
and
you
were
sitting
inside
where
would
it
stop
reflecting
your
face
and
begin
reflecting
your
back
the
more
one
thinks
about
this
problem
the
more
puzzling
it
becomes
you
can
see
with
what
deep
philosophical
reflection
we
engage
our
leisure
did
i
ever
tell
you
about
the
election
it
happened
three
weeks
ago
but
so
fast
do
we
live
that
three
weeks
is
ancient
history
sallie
was
elected
and
we
had
a
torchlight
parade
with
transparencies
saying
for
ever
and
a
band
consisting
of
fourteen
pieces
three
mouth
organs
and
eleven
combs
we
very
important
persons
now
in
julia
and
i
come
in
for
a
great
deal
of
reflected
glory
it
quite
a
social
strain
to
be
living
in
the
same
house
with
a
president
bonne
nuit
cher
daddy
acceptez

judy
november
dear
we
beat
the
freshmen
at
basket
ball
yesterday
of
course
pleased
but
oh
if
we
could
only
beat
the
juniors
i
be
willing
to
be
black
and
blue
all
over
and
stay
in
bed
a
week
in
a
compress
sallie
has
invited
me
to
spend
the
christmas
vacation
with
her
she
lives
in
worcester
massachusetts
was
it
nice
of
her
i
shall
love
to
go
i
never
been
in
a
private
family
in
my
life
except
at
lock
willow
and
the
semples
were
and
old
and
do
count
but
the
mcbrides
have
a
houseful
of
children
anyway
two
or
three
and
a
mother
and
father
and
grandmother
and
an
angora
cat
it
a
perfectly
complete
family
packing
your
trunk
and
going
away
is
more
fun
than
staying
behind
i
am
terribly
excited
at
the
prospect

photograph

leonora
fenton

light

laughing

sallie

the
tall

little
one

the
hair

across
her
face

really
more
beautiful

but

in
her
eyes
gate
worcester
december
dear
i
meant
to
write
to
you
before
and
thank
you
for
your
christmas
cheque
but
life
in
the
mcbride
household
is
very
absorbing
and
i
do
seem
able
to
find
two
consecutive
minutes
to
spend
at
a
desk
i
bought
a
new
gown
one
that
i
did
need
but
just
wanted
my
christmas
present
this
year
is
from
my
family
just
sent
love
i
been
having
the
most
beautiful
vacation
visiting
sallie
she
lives
in
a
big
brick
house
with
white
trimmings
set
back
from
the
street
exactly
the
kind
of
house
that
i
used
to
look
at
so
curiously
when
i
was
in
the
john
grier
home
and
wonder
what
it
could
be
like
inside
i
never
expected
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
but
here
i
am
everything
is
so
comfortable
and
restful
and
homelike
i
walk
from
room
to
room
and
drink
in
the
furnishings
it
is
the
most
perfect
house
for
children
to
be
brought
up
in
with
shadowy
nooks
for
hide
and
seek
and
open
fire
places
for
and
an
attic
to
romp
in
on
rainy
days
and
slippery
banisters
with
a
comfortable
flat
knob
at
the
bottom
and
a
great
big
sunny
kitchen
and
a
nice
fat
sunny
cook
who
has
lived
in
the
family
thirteen
years
and
always
saves
out
a
piece
of
dough
for
the
children
to
bake
just
the
sight
of
such
a
house
makes
you
want
to
be
a
child
all
over
again
and
as
for
families
i
never
dreamed
they
could
be
so
nice
sallie
has
a
father
and
mother
and
grandmother
and
the
sweetest
baby
sister
all
over
curls
and
a
brother
who
always
forgets
to
wipe
his
feet
and
a
big
brother
named
jimmie
who
is
a
junior
at
princeton
we
have
the
jolliest
times
at
the
table
everybody
laughs
and
jokes
and
talks
at
once
and
we
do
have
to
say
grace
beforehand
it
a
relief
not
having
to
thank
somebody
for
every
mouthful
you
eat
i
dare
say
i
blasphemous
but
you
be
too
if
you
offered
as
much
obligatory
thanks
as
i
have
such
a
lot
of
things
we
done
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
about
them
mcbride
owns
a
factory
and
christmas
eve
he
had
a
tree
for
the
employees
children
it
was
in
the
long
which
was
decorated
with
evergreens
and
holly
jimmie
mcbride
was
dressed
as
santa
claus
and
sallie
and
i
helped
him
distribute
the
presents
dear
me
daddy
but
it
was
a
funny
sensation
i
felt
as
benevolent
as
a
trustee
of
the
john
grier
home
i
kissed
one
sweet
sticky
little
boy
but
i
do
think
i
patted
any
of
them
on
the
head
and
two
days
after
christmas
they
gave
a
dance
at
their
own
house
for
me
it
was
the
first
really
true
ball
i
ever
attended
college
count
where
we
dance
with
girls
i
had
a
new
white
evening
gown
your
christmas
present
many
thanks
and
long
white
gloves
and
white
satin
slippers
the
only
drawback
to
my
perfect
utter
absolute
happiness
was
the
fact
that
lippett
could
see
me
leading
the
cotillion
with
jimmie
mcbride
tell
her
about
it
please
the
next
time
you
visit
the
yours
ever
judy
abbott
ps
would
you
be
terribly
displeased
daddy
if
i
did
turn
out
to
be
a
great
author
after
all
but
just
a
plain
girl
saturday
dear
daddy
we
started
to
walk
to
town
today
but
mercy
how
it
poured
i
like
winter
to
be
winter
with
snow
instead
of
rain
julia
desirable
uncle
called
again
this
afternoon
and
brought
a
box
of
chocolates
there
are
advantages
you
see
about
rooming
with
julia
our
innocent
prattle
appeared
to
amuse
him
and
he
waited
for
a
later
train
in
order
to
take
tea
in
the
study
we
had
an
awful
lot
of
trouble
getting
permission
it
hard
enough
entertaining
fathers
and
grandfathers
but
uncles
are
a
step
worse
and
as
for
brothers
and
cousins
they
are
next
to
impossible
julia
had
to
swear
that
he
was
her
uncle
before
a
notary
public
and
then
have
the
county
certificate
attached
do
i
know
a
lot
of
law
and
even
then
i
doubt
if
we
could
have
had
our
tea
if
the
dean
had
chanced
to
see
how
youngish
and
uncle
jervis
is
anyway
we
had
it
with
brown
bread
swiss
cheese
sandwiches
he
helped
make
them
and
then
ate
four
i
told
him
that
i
had
spent
last
summer
at
lock
willow
and
we
had
a
beautiful
gossipy
time
about
the
semples
and
the
horses
and
cows
and
chickens
all
the
horses
that
he
used
to
know
are
dead
except
grover
who
was
a
baby
colt
at
the
time
of
his
last
visit
and
poor
grove
now
is
so
old
he
can
just
limp
about
the
pasture
he
asked
if
they
still
kept
doughnuts
in
a
yellow
crock
with
a
blue
plate
over
it
on
the
bottom
shelf
of
the
pantry
and
they
do
he
wanted
to
know
if
there
was
still
a
woodchuck
hole
under
the
pile
of
rocks
in
the
night
pasture
and
there
is
amasai
caught
a
big
fat
grey
one
there
this
summer
the
of
the
one
master
jervis
caught
when
he
was
a
little
boy
i
called
him
jervie
to
his
face
but
he
did
appear
to
be
insulted
julia
says
she
has
never
seen
him
so
amiable
he
usually
pretty
unapproachable
but
julia
has
a
bit
of
tact
and
men
i
find
require
a
great
deal
they
purr
if
you
rub
them
the
right
way
and
spit
if
you
do
that
is
a
very
elegant
metaphor
i
mean
it
figuratively
we
reading
marie
bashkirtseff
journal
is
it
amazing
listen
to
this
night
i
was
seized
by
a
fit
of
despair
that
found
utterance
in
moans
and
that
finally
drove
me
to
throw
the
clock
into
the
sea
it
makes
me
almost
hope
i
not
a
genius
they
must
be
very
wearing
to
have
about
and
awfully
destructive
to
the
furniture
mercy
how
it
keeps
pouring
we
shall
have
to
swim
to
chapel
tonight
yours
ever
judy
dear
did
you
ever
have
a
sweet
baby
girl
who
was
stolen
from
the
cradle
in
infancy
maybe
i
am
she
if
we
were
in
a
novel
that
would
be
the
denouement
would
it
it
really
awfully
queer
not
to
know
what
one
is
sort
of
exciting
and
romantic
there
are
such
a
lot
of
possibilities
maybe
i
not
american
lots
of
people
are
i
may
be
straight
descended
from
the
ancient
romans
or
i
may
be
a
viking
daughter
or
i
may
be
the
child
of
a
russian
exile
and
belong
by
rights
in
a
siberian
prison
or
maybe
i
a
gipsy
i
think
perhaps
i
am
i
have
a
very
wandering
spirit
though
i
have
as
yet
had
much
chance
to
develop
it
do
you
know
about
that
one
scandalous
blot
in
my
career
the
time
i
ran
away
from
the
asylum
because
they
punished
me
for
stealing
cookies
it
down
in
the
books
free
for
any
trustee
to
read
but
really
daddy
what
could
you
expect
when
you
put
a
hungry
little
girl
in
the
pantry
scouring
knives
with
the
cookie
jar
at
her
elbow
and
go
off
and
leave
her
alone
and
then
suddenly
pop
in
again
would
you
expect
to
find
her
a
bit
crumby
and
then
when
you
jerk
her
by
the
elbow
and
box
her
ears
and
make
her
leave
the
table
when
the
pudding
comes
and
tell
all
the
other
children
that
it
because
she
a
thief
would
you
expect
her
to
run
away
i
only
ran
four
miles
they
caught
me
and
brought
me
back
and
every
day
for
a
week
i
was
tied
like
a
naughty
puppy
to
a
stake
in
the
back
yard
while
the
other
children
were
out
at
recess
oh
dear
there
the
chapel
bell
and
after
chapel
i
have
a
committee
meeting
i
sorry
because
i
meant
to
write
you
a
very
entertaining
letter
this
time
auf
wiedersehen
cher
daddy
pax
tibi
judy
ps
there
one
thing
i
perfectly
sure
of
i
not
a
chinaman
february
dear
jimmie
mcbride
has
sent
me
a
princeton
banner
as
big
as
one
end
of
the
room
i
am
very
grateful
to
him
for
remembering
me
but
i
do
know
what
on
earth
to
do
with
it
sallie
and
julia
wo
let
me
hang
it
up
our
room
this
year
is
furnished
in
red
and
you
can
imagine
what
an
effect
we
have
if
i
added
orange
and
black
but
it
such
nice
warm
thick
felt
i
hate
to
waste
it
would
it
be
very
improper
to
have
it
made
into
a
bath
robe
my
old
one
shrank
when
it
was
washed
i
entirely
omitted
of
late
telling
you
what
i
am
learning
but
though
you
might
not
imagine
it
from
my
letters
my
time
is
exclusively
occupied
with
study
it
a
very
bewildering
matter
to
get
educated
in
five
branches
at
once
test
of
true
scholarship
says
chemistry
professor
a
painstaking
passion
for
detail
careful
not
to
keep
your
eyes
glued
to
detail
says
history
professor
far
enough
away
to
get
a
perspective
of
the
whole
you
can
see
with
what
nicety
we
have
to
trim
our
sails
between
chemistry
and
history
i
like
the
historical
method
best
if
i
say
that
william
the
conqueror
came
over
in
and
columbus
discovered
america
in
or
or
whenever
it
was
that
a
mere
detail
that
the
professor
overlooks
it
gives
a
feeling
of
security
and
restfulness
to
the
history
recitation
that
is
entirely
lacking
in
chemistry
bell
i
must
go
to
the
laboratory
and
look
into
a
little
matter
of
acids
and
salts
and
alkalis
i
burned
a
hole
as
big
as
a
plate
in
the
front
of
my
chemistry
apron
with
hydrochloric
acid
if
the
theory
worked
i
ought
to
be
able
to
neutralize
that
hole
with
good
strong
ammonia
ought
i
examinations
next
week
but
who
afraid
yours
ever
judy
march
dear
there
is
a
march
wind
blowing
and
the
sky
is
filled
with
heavy
black
moving
clouds
the
crows
in
the
pine
trees
are
making
such
a
clamour
it
an
intoxicating
exhilarating
calling
noise
you
want
to
close
your
books
and
be
off
over
the
hills
to
race
with
the
wind
we
had
a
paper
chase
last
saturday
over
five
miles
of
squashy
country
the
fox
composed
of
three
girls
and
a
bushel
or
so
of
confetti
started
half
an
hour
before
the
hunters
i
was
one
of
the
eight
dropped
by
the
wayside
we
ended
nineteen
the
trail
led
over
a
hill
through
a
cornfield
and
into
a
swamp
where
we
had
to
leap
lightly
from
hummock
to
hummock
of
course
half
of
us
went
in
ankle
deep
we
kept
losing
the
trail
and
we
wasted
minutes
over
that
swamp
then
up
a
hill
through
some
woods
and
in
at
a
barn
window
the
barn
doors
were
all
locked
and
the
window
was
up
high
and
pretty
small
i
do
call
that
fair
do
you
but
we
did
go
through
we
circumnavigated
the
barn
and
picked
up
the
trail
where
it
issued
by
way
of
a
low
shed
roof
on
to
the
top
of
a
fence
the
fox
thought
he
had
us
there
but
we
fooled
him
then
straight
away
over
two
miles
of
rolling
meadow
and
awfully
hard
to
follow
for
the
confetti
was
getting
sparse
the
rule
is
that
it
must
be
at
the
most
six
feet
apart
but
they
were
the
longest
six
feet
i
ever
saw
finally
after
two
hours
of
steady
trotting
we
tracked
monsieur
fox
into
the
kitchen
of
crystal
spring
that
a
farm
where
the
girls
go
in
bob
sleighs
and
hay
wagons
for
chicken
and
waffle
suppers
and
we
found
the
three
foxes
placidly
eating
milk
and
honey
and
biscuits
they
had
thought
we
would
get
that
far
they
were
expecting
us
to
stick
in
the
barn
window
both
sides
insist
that
they
won
i
think
we
did
do
you
because
we
caught
them
before
they
got
back
to
the
campus
anyway
all
nineteen
of
us
settled
like
locusts
over
the
furniture
and
clamoured
for
honey
there
was
enough
to
go
round
but
mrs
crystal
spring
that
our
pet
name
for
her
she
by
rights
a
johnson
brought
up
a
jar
of
strawberry
jam
and
a
can
of
maple
syrup
just
made
last
week
and
three
loaves
of
brown
bread
we
did
get
back
to
college
till
six
half
an
hour
late
for
dinner
and
we
went
straight
in
without
dressing
and
with
perfectly
unimpaired
appetites
then
we
all
cut
evening
chapel
the
state
of
our
boots
being
enough
of
an
excuse
i
never
told
you
about
examinations
i
passed
everything
with
the
utmost
ease
i
know
the
secret
now
and
am
never
going
to
fail
again
i
sha
be
able
to
graduate
with
honours
though
because
of
that
beastly
latin
prose
and
geometry
freshman
year
but
i
do
care
wot
the
hodds
so
long
as
you
that
a
quotation
been
reading
the
english
classics
speaking
of
classics
have
you
ever
read
hamlet
if
you
have
do
it
right
off
it
perfectly
corking
i
been
hearing
about
shakespeare
all
my
life
but
i
had
no
idea
he
really
wrote
so
well
i
always
suspected
him
of
going
largely
on
his
reputation
i
have
a
beautiful
play
that
i
invented
a
long
time
ago
when
i
first
learned
to
read
i
put
myself
to
sleep
every
night
by
pretending
the
person
the
most
important
person
in
the
book
i
reading
at
the
moment
at
present
i
ophelia
and
such
a
sensible
ophelia
i
keep
hamlet
amused
all
the
time
and
pet
him
and
scold
him
and
make
him
wrap
up
his
throat
when
he
has
a
cold
i
entirely
cured
him
of
being
melancholy
the
king
and
queen
are
both
dead
an
accident
at
sea
no
funeral
necessary
so
hamlet
and
i
are
ruling
in
denmark
without
any
bother
we
have
the
kingdom
working
beautifully
he
takes
care
of
the
governing
and
i
look
after
the
charities
i
have
just
founded
some
orphan
asylums
if
you
or
any
of
the
other
trustees
would
like
to
visit
them
i
shall
be
pleased
to
show
you
through
i
think
you
might
find
a
great
many
helpful
suggestions
i
remain
sir
yours

graciously

ever
hear
of
anything
so
exciting
i
never
been
in
a
hotel
in
my
life
nor
in
a
theatre
except
once
when
the
catholic
church
had
a
festival
and
invited
the
orphans
but
that
was
a
real
play
and
it
does
count
and
what
do
you
think
we
going
to
see
hamlet
think
of
that
we
studied
it
for
four
weeks
in
shakespeare
class
and
i
know
it
by
heart
i
am
so
excited
over
all
these
prospects
that
i
can
scarcely
sleep
goodbye
daddy
this
is
a
very
entertaining
world
yours
ever
judy
ps
i
just
looked
at
the
calendar
it
the
another
postscript
i
saw
a
street
car
conductor
today
with
one
brown
eye
and
one
blue
would
he
make
a
nice
villain
for
a
detective
story
april
dear
mercy
is
new
york
big
worcester
is
nothing
to
it
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
actually
live
in
all
that
confusion
i
believe
that
i
shall
recover
for
months
from
the
bewildering
effect
of
two
days
of
it
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
all
the
amazing
things
seen
i
suppose
you
know
though
since
you
live
there
yourself
but
are
the
streets
entertaining
and
the
people
and
the
shops
i
never
saw
such
lovely
things
as
there
are
in
the
windows
it
makes
you
want
to
devote
your
life
to
wearing
clothes
sallie
and
julia
and
i
went
shopping
together
saturday
morning
julia
went
into
the
very
most
gorgeous
place
i
ever
saw
white
and
gold
walls
and
blue
carpets
and
blue
silk
curtains
and
gilt
chairs
a
perfectly
beautiful
lady
with
yellow
hair
and
a
long
black
silk
trailing
gown
came
to
meet
us
with
a
welcoming
smile
i
thought
we
were
paying
a
social
call
and
started
to
shake
hands
but
it
seems
we
were
only
buying
hats
at
least
julia
was
she
sat
down
in
front
of
a
mirror
and
tried
on
a
dozen
each
lovelier
than
the
last
and
bought
the
two
loveliest
of
all
i
ca
imagine
any
joy
in
life
greater
than
sitting
down
in
front
of
a
mirror
and
buying
any
hat
you
choose
without
having
first
to
consider
the
price
there
no
doubt
about
it
daddy
new
york
would
rapidly
undermine
this
fine
stoical
character
which
the
john
grier
home
so
patiently
built
up
and
after
we
finished
our
shopping
we
met
master
jervie
at
sherry
i
suppose
you
been
in
sherry
picture
that
then
picture
the
of
the
john
grier
home
with
its
tables
and
white
crockery
that
you
ca
break
and
knives
and
forks
and
fancy
the
way
i
felt
i
ate
my
fish
with
the
wrong
fork
but
the
waiter
very
kindly
gave
me
another
so
that
nobody
noticed
and
after
luncheon
we
went
to
the
theatre
it
was
dazzling
marvellous
unbelievable
i
dream
about
it
every
night
is
shakespeare
wonderful
hamlet
is
so
much
better
on
the
stage
than
when
we
analyze
it
in
class
i
appreciated
it
before
but
now
dear
me
i
think
if
you
do
mind
that
i
rather
be
an
actress
than
a
writer
would
you
like
me
to
leave
college
and
go
into
a
dramatic
school
and
then
i
send
you
a
box
for
all
my
performances
and
smile
at
you
across
the
footlights
only
wear
a
red
rose
in
your
buttonhole
please
so
i
surely
smile
at
the
right
man
it
would
be
an
awfully
embarrassing
mistake
if
i
picked
out
the
wrong
one
we
came
back
saturday
night
and
had
our
dinner
in
the
train
at
little
tables
with
pink
lamps
and
negro
waiters
i
never
heard
of
meals
being
served
in
trains
before
and
i
inadvertently
said
so
on
earth
were
you
brought
up
said
julia
to
me
a
village
said
i
meekly
to
julia
did
you
ever
travel
said
she
to
me
till
i
came
to
college
and
then
it
was
only
a
hundred
and
sixty
miles
and
we
did
eat
said
i
to
her
she
getting
quite
interested
in
me
because
i
say
such
funny
things
i
try
hard
not
to
but
they
do
pop
out
when
i
surprised
and
surprised
most
of
the
time
it
a
dizzying
experience
daddy
to
pass
eighteen
years
in
the
john
grier
home
and
then
suddenly
to
be
plunged
into
the
world
but
i
getting
acclimated
i
do
make
such
awful
mistakes
as
i
did
and
i
do
feel
uncomfortable
any
more
with
the
other
girls
i
used
to
squirm
whenever
people
looked
at
me
i
felt
as
though
they
saw
right
through
my
sham
new
clothes
to
the
checked
ginghams
underneath
but
i
not
letting
the
ginghams
bother
me
any
more
sufficient
unto
yesterday
is
the
evil
thereof
i
forgot
to
tell
you
about
our
flowers
master
jervie
gave
us
each
a
big
bunch
of
violets
and
was
that
sweet
of
him
i
never
used
to
care
much
for
men
judging
by
trustees
but
changing
my
mind
eleven
pages
this
is
a
letter
have
courage
i
going
to
stop
yours
always
judy
april
dear
here
your
cheque
for
fifty
dollars
thank
you
very
much
but
i
do
not
feel
that
i
can
keep
it
my
allowance
is
sufficient
to
afford
all
of
the
hats
that
i
need
i
am
sorry
that
i
wrote
all
that
silly
stuff
about
the
millinery
shop
it
just
that
i
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
however
i
was
begging
and
i
would
rather
not
accept
any
more
charity
than
i
have
to
sincerely
yours
jerusha
abbott
april
dearest
daddy
will
you
please
forgive
me
for
the
letter
i
wrote
you
yesterday
after
i
posted
it
i
was
sorry
and
tried
to
get
it
back
but
that
beastly
mail
clerk
would
give
it
back
to
me
it
the
middle
of
the
night
now
i
been
awake
for
hours
thinking
what
a
worm
i
am
what
a
worm
and
that
the
worst
i
can
say
i
closed
the
door
very
softly
into
the
study
so
as
not
to
wake
julia
and
sallie
and
am
sitting
up
in
bed
writing
to
you
on
paper
torn
out
of
my
history
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
am
sorry
i
was
so
impolite
about
your
cheque
i
know
you
meant
it
kindly
and
i
think
you
an
old
dear
to
take
so
much
trouble
for
such
a
silly
thing
as
a
hat
i
ought
to
have
returned
it
very
much
more
graciously
but
in
any
case
i
had
to
return
it
it
different
with
me
than
with
other
girls
they
can
take
things
naturally
from
people
they
have
fathers
and
brothers
and
aunts
and
uncles
but
i
ca
be
on
any
such
relations
with
any
one
i
like
to
pretend
that
you
belong
to
me
just
to
play
with
the
idea
but
of
course
i
know
you
do
i
alone
really
with
my
back
to
the
wall
fighting
the
world
and
i
get
sort
of
gaspy
when
i
think
about
it
i
put
it
out
of
my
mind
and
keep
on
pretending
but
do
you
see
daddy
i
ca
accept
any
more
money
than
i
have
to
because
some
day
i
shall
be
wanting
to
pay
it
back
and
even
as
great
an
author
as
i
intend
to
be
wo
be
able
to
face
a
perfectly
tremendous
debt
i
love
pretty
hats
and
things
but
i
must
mortgage
the
future
to
pay
for
them
you
forgive
me
wo
you
for
being
so
rude
i
have
an
awful
habit
of
writing
impulsively
when
i
first
think
things
and
then
posting
the
letter
beyond
recall
but
if
i
sometimes
seem
thoughtless
and
ungrateful
i
never
mean
it
in
my
heart
i
thank
you
always
for
the
life
and
freedom
and
independence
that
you
have
given
me
my
childhood
was
just
a
long
sullen
stretch
of
revolt
and
now
i
am
so
happy
every
moment
of
the
day
that
i
ca
believe
it
true
i
feel
like
a
heroine
in
a
it
a
quarter
past
two
i
going
to
tiptoe
out
to
post
this
off
now
you
receive
it
in
the
next
mail
after
the
other
so
you
wo
have
a
very
long
time
to
think
bad
of
me
good
night
daddy
i
love
you
always
judy
may
dear
field
day
last
saturday
it
was
a
very
spectacular
occasion
first
we
had
a
parade
of
all
the
classes
with
everybody
dressed
in
white
linen
the
seniors
carrying
blue
and
gold
japanese
umbrellas
and
the
juniors
white
and
yellow
banners
our
class
had
crimson
balloons
very
fetching
especially
as
they
were
always
getting
loose
and
floating
off
and
the
freshmen
wore
green
hats
with
long
streamers
also
we
had
a
band
in
blue
uniforms
hired
from
town
also
about
a
dozen
funny
people
like
clowns
in
a
circus
to
keep
the
spectators
entertained
between
events
julia
was
dressed
as
a
fat
country
man
with
a
linen
duster
and
whiskers
and
baggy
umbrella
patsy
moriarty
patrici
really
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
name
lippett
could
have
done
better
who
is
tall
and
thin
was
julia
wife
in
a
absurd
green
bonnet
over
one
ear
waves
of
laughter
followed
them
the
whole
length
of
the
course
julia
played
the
part
extremely
well
i
never
dreamed
that
a
pendleton
could
display
so
much
comedy
spirit
begging
master
jervie
pardon
i
consider
him
a
true
pendleton
though
any
more
than
i
consider
you
a
true
trustee
sallie
and
i
were
in
the
parade
because
we
were
entered
for
the
events
and
what
do
you
think
we
both
won
at
least
in
something
we
tried
for
the
running
broad
jump
and
lost
but
sallie
won
the
seven
feet
three
inches
and
i
won
the
sprint
eight
seconds
i
was
pretty
panting
at
the
end
but
it
was
great
fun
with
the
whole
class
waving
balloons
and
cheering
and
yelling
what
the
matter
with
judy
abbott
she
all
right
who
all
right
judy
that
daddy
is
true
fame
then
trotting
back
to
the
dressing
tent
and
being
rubbed
down
with
alcohol
and
having
a
lemon
to
suck
you
see
we
very
professional
it
a
fine
thing
to
win
an
event
for
your
class
because
the
class
that
wins
the
most
gets
the
athletic
cup
for
the
year
the
seniors
won
it
this
year
with
seven
events
to
their
credit
the
athletic
association
gave
a
dinner
in
the
gymnasium
to
all
of
the
winners
we
had
fried
crabs
and
chocolate
moulded
in
the
shape
of
basket
balls
i
sat
up
half
of
last
night
reading
jane
eyre
are
you
old
enough
daddy
to
remember
sixty
years
ago
and
if
so
did
people
talk
that
way
the
haughty
lady
blanche
says
to
the
footman
your
chattering
knave
and
do
my
bidding
rochester
talks
about
the
metal
welkin
when
he
means
the
sky
and
as
for
the
mad
woman
who
laughs
like
a
hyena
and
sets
fire
to
bed
curtains
and
tears
up
wedding
veils
and
bites
it
melodrama
of
the
purest
but
just
the
same
you
read
and
read
and
read
i
ca
see
how
any
girl
could
have
written
such
a
book
especially
any
girl
who
was
brought
up
in
a
churchyard
something
about
those
brontes
that
fascinates
me
their
books
their
lives
their
spirit
where
did
they
get
it
when
i
was
reading
about
little
jane
troubles
in
the
charity
school
i
got
so
angry
that
i
had
to
go
out
and
take
a
walk
i
understood
exactly
how
she
felt
having
known
lippett
i
could
see
brocklehurst
do
be
outraged
daddy
i
am
not
intimating
that
the
john
grier
home
was
like
the
lowood
institute
we
had
plenty
to
eat
and
plenty
to
wear
sufficient
water
to
wash
in
and
a
furnace
in
the
cellar
but
there
was
one
deadly
likeness
our
lives
were
absolutely
monotonous
and
uneventful
nothing
nice
ever
happened
except
on
sundays
and
even
that
was
regular
in
all
the
eighteen
years
i
was
there
i
only
had
one
adventure
when
the
woodshed
burned
we
had
to
get
up
in
the
night
and
dress
so
as
to
be
ready
in
case
the
house
should
catch
but
it
did
catch
and
we
went
back
to
bed
everybody
likes
a
few
surprises
it
a
perfectly
natural
human
craving
but
i
never
had
one
until
lippett
called
me
to
the
office
to
tell
me
that
john
smith
was
going
to
send
me
to
college
and
then
she
broke
the
news
so
gradually
that
it
just
barely
shocked
me
you
know
daddy
i
think
that
the
most
necessary
quality
for
any
person
to
have
is
imagination
it
makes
people
able
to
put
themselves
in
other
people
places
it
makes
them
kind
and
sympathetic
and
understanding
it
ought
to
be
cultivated
in
children
but
the
john
grier
home
instantly
stamped
out
the
slightest
flicker
that
appeared
duty
was
the
one
quality
that
was
encouraged
i
do
think
children
ought
to
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
it
odious
detestable
they
ought
to
do
everything
from
love
wait
until
you
see
the
orphan
asylum
that
i
am
going
to
be
the
head
of
it
my
favourite
play
at
night
before
i
go
to
sleep
i
plan
it
out
to
the
littlest
detail
the
meals
and
clothes
and
study
and
amusements
and
punishments
for
even
my
superior
orphans
are
sometimes
bad
but
anyway
they
are
going
to
be
happy
i
think
that
every
one
no
matter
how
many
troubles
he
may
have
when
he
grows
up
ought
to
have
a
happy
childhood
to
look
back
upon
and
if
i
ever
have
any
children
of
my
own
no
matter
how
unhappy
i
may
be
i
am
not
going
to
let
them
have
any
cares
until
they
grow
up
there
goes
the
chapel
bell
i
finish
this
letter
sometime
thursday
when
i
came
in
from
laboratory
this
afternoon
i
found
a
squirrel
sitting
on
the
tea
table
helping
himself
to
almonds
these
are
the
kind
of
callers
we
entertain
now
that
warm
weather
has
come
and
the
windows
stay
open
saturday
morning
perhaps
you
think
last
night
being
friday
with
no
classes
today
that
i
passed
a
nice
quiet
readable
evening
with
the
set
of
stevenson
that
i
bought
with
my
prize
money
but
if
so
you
never
attended
a
girls
college
daddy
dear
six
friends
dropped
in
to
make
fudge
and
one
of
them
dropped
the
fudge
while
it
was
still
liquid
right
in
the
middle
of
our
best
rug
we
shall
never
be
able
to
clean
up
the
mess
i
have
mentioned
any
lessons
of
late
but
we
are
still
having
them
every
day
it
sort
of
a
relief
though
to
get
away
from
them
and
discuss
life
in
the
large
rather
discussions
that
you
and
i
hold
but
that
your
own
fault
you
are
welcome
to
answer
back
any
time
you
choose
i
been
writing
this
letter
off
and
on
for
three
days
and
i
fear
by
now

judy

you
will

nice
thing
that

happened
the
mcbrides

asked

to
spend
the
summer
at
their

adirondacks
they
belong

a
sort
of

houses
made
of
logs
dotted
about
among
the
trees
and

take
long
walks
through
trails

other
camps
and
have
dances

going
to
have
a
college
friend
visiting
him
part
of
the
summer
so
you
see
we
shall
have
plenty
of
men
to
dance
with
was
it
sweet
of
mcbride
to
ask
me
it
appears
that
she
liked
me
when
i
was
there
for
christmas
please
excuse
this
being
short
it
is
a
real
letter
it
just
to
let
you
know
that
i
disposed
of
for
the
summer
yours
in
a
very
contented
frame
of
mind
judy
june
dear
your
secretary
man
has
just
written
to
me
saying
that
smith
prefers
that
i
should
not
accept
mcbride
invitation
but
should
return
to
lock
willow
the
same
as
last
summer
why
why
why
daddy
you
do
understand
about
it
mcbride
does
want
me
really
and
truly
i
not
the
least
bit
of
trouble
in
the
house
i
a
help
they
do
take
up
many
servants
and
sallie
an
i
can
do
lots
of
useful
things
it
a
fine
chance
for
me
to
learn
housekeeping
every
woman
ought
to
understand
it
and
i
only
know
there
are
any
girls
our
age
at
the
camp
and
mcbride
wants
me
for
a
companion
for
sallie
we
are
planning
to
do
a
lot
of
reading
together
we
are
going
to
read
all
of
the
books
for
next
english
and
sociology
the
professor
said
it
would
be
a
great
help
if
we
would
get
our
reading
finished
in
the
summer
and
it
so
much
easier
to
remember
it
if
we
read
together
and
talk
it
over
just
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
sallie
mother
is
an
education
she
the
most
interesting
entertaining
companionable
charming
woman
in
the
world
she
knows
everything
think
how
many
summers
i
spent
with
lippett
and
how
i
appreciate
the
contrast
you
need
be
afraid
that
i
be
crowding
them
for
their
house
is
made
of
rubber
when
they
have
a
lot
of
company
they
just
sprinkle
tents
about
in
the
woods
and
turn
the
boys
outside
it
going
to
be
such
a
nice
healthy
summer
exercising
out
of
doors
every
minute
jimmie
mcbride
is
going
to
teach
me
how
to
ride
horseback
and
paddle
a
canoe
and
how
to
shoot
and
oh
lots
of
things
i
ought
to
know
it
the
kind
of
nice
jolly
time
that
i
never
had
and
i
think
every
girl
deserves
it
once
in
her
life
of
course
i
do
exactly
as
you
say
but
please
please
let
me
go
daddy
i
never
wanted
anything
so
much
this
is
jerusha
abbott
the
future
great
author
writing
to
you
it
just
judy
a
girl
june
john
smith
sir
yours
of
the
inst
at
hand
in
compliance
with
the
instructions
received
through
your
secretary
i
leave
on
friday
next
to
spend
the
summer
at
lock
willow
farm
i
hope
always
to
remain
miss
jerusha
abbott
lock
willow
farm
august
dear
it
has
been
nearly
two
months
since
i
wrote
which
was
nice
of
me
i
know
but
i
have
loved
you
much
this
summer
you
see
i
being
frank
you
ca
imagine
how
disappointed
i
was
at
having
to
give
up
the
mcbrides
camp
of
course
i
know
that
you
my
guardian
and
that
i
have
to
regard
your
wishes
in
all
matters
but
i
could
see
any
reason
it
was
so
distinctly
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
me
if
i
had
been
daddy
and
you
had
been
judy
i
should
have
said
you
my
child
run
along
and
have
a
good
time
see
lots
of
new
people
and
learn
lots
of
new
things
live
out
of
doors
and
get
strong
and
well
and
rested
for
a
year
of
hard
work
but
not
at
all
just
a
curt
line
from
your
secretary
ordering
me
to
lock
willow
it
the
impersonality
of
your
commands
that
hurts
my
feelings
it
seems
as
though
if
you
felt
the
tiniest
little
bit
for
me
the
way
i
feel
for
you
you
sometimes
send
me
a
message
that
you
written
with
your
own
hand
instead
of
those
beastly
typewritten
secretary
notes
if
there
were
the
slightest
hint
that
you
cared
i
do
anything
on
earth
to
please
you
i
know
that
i
was
to
write
nice
long
detailed
letters
without
ever
expecting
any
answer
you
living
up
to
your
side
of
the
bargain
i
being
educated
and
i
suppose
you
thinking
i
not
living
up
to
mine
but
daddy
it
is
a
hard
bargain
it
is
really
i
so
awfully
lonely
you
are
the
only
person
i
have
to
care
for
and
you
are
so
shadowy
you
just
an
imaginary
man
that
i
made
up
and
probably
the
real
you
is
a
bit
like
my
imaginary
you
but
you
did
once
when
i
was
ill
in
the
infirmary
send
me
a
message
and
now
when
i
am
feeling
awfully
forgotten
i
get
out
your
card
and
read
it
over
i
do
think
i
am
telling
you
at
all
what
i
started
to
say
which
was
this
although
my
feelings
are
still
hurt
for
it
is
very
humiliating
to
be
picked
up
and
moved
about
by
an
arbitrary
peremptory
unreasonable
omnipotent
invisible
providence
still
when
a
man
has
been
as
kind
and
generous
and
thoughtful
as
you
have
heretofore
been
towards
me
i
suppose
he
has
a
right
to
be
an
arbitrary
peremptory
unreasonable
invisible
providence
if
he
chooses
and
so
i
forgive
you
and
be
cheerful
again
but
i
still
do
enjoy
getting
sallie
letters
about
the
good
times
they
are
having
in
camp
however
we
will
draw
a
veil
over
that
and
begin
again
i
been
writing
and
writing
this
summer
four
short
stories
finished
and
sent
to
four
different
magazines
so
you
see
i
trying
to
be
an
author
i
have
a
workroom
fixed
in
a
corner
of
the
attic
where
master
jervie
used
to
have
his
playroom
it
in
a
cool
breezy
corner
with
two
dormer
windows
and
shaded
by
a
maple
tree
with
a
family
of
red
squirrels
living
in
a
hole
i
write
a
nicer
letter
in
a
few
days
and
tell
you
all
the
farm
news
we
need
rain
yours
as
ever
judy
august
sir
i
address
you
from
the
second
crotch
in
the
willow
tree
by
the
pool
in
the
pasture
there
a
frog
croaking
underneath
a
locust
singing
overhead
and
two
little
downheads
darting
up
and
down
the
trunk
i
been
here
for
an
hour
it
a
very
comfortable
crotch
especially
after
being
upholstered
with
two
sofa
cushions
i
came
up
with
a
pen
and
tablet
hoping
to
write
an
immortal
short
story
but
been
having
a
dreadful
time
with
my
heroine
i
ca
make
her
behave
as
i
want
her
to
behave
so
i
abandoned
her
for
the
moment
and
am
writing
to
you
not
much
relief
though
for
i
ca
make
you
behave
as
i
want
you
to
either
if
you
are
in
that
dreadful
new
york
i
wish
i
could
send
you
some
of
this
lovely
breezy
sunshiny
outlook
the
country
is
heaven
after
a
week
of
rain
speaking
of
heaven
do
you
remember
kellogg
that
i
told
you
about
last
summer
the
minister
of
the
little
white
church
at
the
corners
well
the
poor
old
soul
is
dead
last
winter
of
pneumonia
i
went
half
a
dozen
times
to
hear
him
preach
and
got
very
well
acquainted
with
his
theology
he
believed
to
the
end
exactly
the
same
things
he
started
with
it
seems
to
me
that
a
man
who
can
think
straight
along
for
years
without
changing
a
single
idea
ought
to
be
kept
in
a
cabinet
as
a
curiosity
i
hope
he
is
enjoying
his
harp
and
golden
crown
he
was
so
perfectly
sure
of
finding
them
there
a
new
young
man
very
consequential
in
his
place
the
congregation
is
pretty
dubious
especially
the
faction
led
by
deacon
cummings
it
looks
as
though
there
was
going
to
be
an
awful
split
in
the
church
we
care
for
innovations
in
religion
in
this
neighbourhood
during
our
week
of
rain
i
sat
up
in
the
attic
and
had
an
orgy
of
reading
stevenson
mostly
he
himself
is
more
entertaining
than
any
of
the
characters
in
his
books
i
dare
say
he
made
himself
into
the
kind
of
hero
that
would
look
well
in
print
do
you
think
it
was
perfect
of
him
to
spend
all
the
ten
thousand
dollars
his
father
left
for
a
yacht
and
go
sailing
off
to
the
south
seas
he
lived
up
to
his
adventurous
creed
if
my
father
had
left
me
ten
thousand
dollars
do
it
too
the
thought
of
vailima
makes
me
wild
i
want
to
see
the
tropics
i
want
to
see
the
whole
world
i
am
going
to
be
a
great
author
or
artist
or
actress
or
playwright
or
whatever
sort
of
a
great
person
i
turn
out
to
be
i
have
a
terrible
wanderthirst
the
very
sight
of
a
map
makes
me
want
to
put
on
my
hat
and
take
an
umbrella
and
start
shall
see
before
i
die
the
palms
and
temples
of
the
south
thursday
evening
at
twilight
sitting
on
the
doorstep
very
hard
to
get
any
news
into
this
letter
judy
is
becoming
so
philosophical
of
late
that
she
wishes
to
discourse
largely
of
the
world
in
general
instead
of
descending
to
the
trivial
details
of
daily
life
but
if
you
must
have
news
here
it
is
our
nine
young
pigs
waded
across
the
brook
and
ran
away
last
tuesday
and
only
eight
came
back
we
do
want
to
accuse
anyone
unjustly
but
we
suspect
that
widow
dowd
has
one
more
than
she
ought
to
have
weaver
has
painted
his
barn
and
his
two
silos
a
bright
pumpkin
yellow
a
very
ugly
colour
but
he
says
it
will
wear
the
brewers
have
company
this
week
mrs
brewer
sister
and
two
nieces
from
ohio
one
of
our
rhode
island
reds
only
brought
off
three
chicks
out
of
fifteen
eggs
we
ca
imagine
what
was
the
trouble
rhode
island
reds
in
my
opinion
are
a
very
inferior
breed
i
prefer
buff
orpingtons
the
new
clerk
in
the
post
office
at
bonnyrigg
four
corners
drank
every
drop
of
jamaica
ginger
they
had
in
stock
seven
dollars
worth
before
he
was
discovered
old
ira
hatch
has
rheumatism
and
ca
work
any
more
he
never
saved
his
money
when
he
was
earning
good
wages
so
now
he
has
to
live
on
the
town
there
to
be
an
social
at
the
schoolhouse
next
saturday
evening
come
and
bring
your
families
i
have
a
new
hat
that
i
bought
for
cents
at
the
post
office
this
is
my
latest
portrait
on
my
way
to
rake
the
hay
it
getting
too
dark
to
see
anyway
the
news
is
all
used
up
good
night
judy
friday
good
morning
here
is
some
news
what
do
you
think
you
never
never
never
guess
who
coming
to
lock
willow
a
letter
to
semple
from
pendleton
he
motoring
through
the
berkshires
and
is
tired
and
wants
to
rest
on
a
nice
quiet
farm
if
he
climbs
out
at
her
doorstep
some
night
will
she
have
a
room
ready
for
him
maybe
he
stay
one
week
or
maybe
two
or
maybe
three
he
see
how
restful
it
is
when
he
gets
here
such
a
flutter
as
we
are
in
the
whole
house
is
being
cleaned
and
all
the
curtains
washed
i
am
driving
to
the
corners
this
morning
to
get
some
new
oilcloth
for
the
entry
and
two
cans
of
brown
floor
paint
for
the
hall
and
back
stairs
dowd
is
engaged
to
come
tomorrow
to
wash
the
windows
in
the
exigency
of
the
moment
we
waive
our
suspicions
in
regard
to
the
piglet
you
might
think
from
this
account
of
our
activities
that
the
house
was
not
already
immaculate
but
i
assure
you
it
was
whatever
semple
limitations
she
is
a
housekeeper
but
is
it
just
like
a
man
daddy
he
does
give
the
remotest
hint
as
to
whether
he
will
land
on
the
doorstep
today
or
two
weeks
from
today
we
shall
live
in
a
perpetual
breathlessness
until
he
comes
and
if
he
does
hurry
the
cleaning
may
all
have
to
be
done
over
again
there
amasai
waiting
below
with
the
buckboard
and
grover
i
drive
alone
but
if
you
could
see
old
grove
you
would
be
worried
as
to
my
safety
with
my
hand
on
my
heart
farewell
judy
ps
is
that
a
nice
ending
i
got
it
out
of
stevenson
letters
saturday
good
morning
again
i
did
get
this
enveloped
yesterday
before
the
postman
came
so
i
add
some
more
we
have
one
mail
a
day
at
twelve
rural
delivery
is
a
blessing
to
the
farmers
our
postman
not
only
delivers
letters
but
he
runs
errands
for
us
in
town
at
five
cents
an
errand
yesterday
he
brought
me
some
and
a
jar
of
cold
cream
i
sunburned
all
the
skin
off
my
nose
before
i
got
my
new
hat
and
a
blue
windsor
tie
and
a
bottle
of
blacking
all
for
ten
cents
that
was
an
unusual
bargain
owing
to
the
largeness
of
my
order
also
he
tells
us
what
is
happening
in
the
great
world
several
people
on
the
route
take
daily
papers
and
he
reads
them
as
he
jogs
along
and
repeats
the
news
to
the
ones
who
do
subscribe
so
in
case
a
war
breaks
out
between
the
united
states
and
japan
or
the
president
is
assassinated
or
rockefeller
leaves
a
million
dollars
to
the
john
grier
home
you
need
bother
to
write
i
hear
it
anyway
no
sign
yet
of
master
jervie
but
you
should
see
how
clean
our
house
is
and
with
what
anxiety
we
wipe
our
feet
before
we
step
in
i
hope
he
come
soon
i
am
longing
for
someone
to
talk
to
semple
to
tell
you
the
truth
gets
rather
monotonous
she
never
lets
ideas
interrupt
the
easy
flow
of
her
conversation
it
a
funny
thing
about
the
people
here
their
world
is
just
this
single
hilltop
they
are
not
a
bit
universal
if
you
know
what
i
mean
it
exactly
the
same
as
at
the
john
grier
home
our
ideas
there
were
bounded
by
the
four
sides
of
the
iron
fence
only
i
did
mind
it
so
much
because
i
was
younger
and
was
so
awfully
busy
by
the
time
i
got
all
my
beds
made
and
my
babies
faces
washed
and
had
gone
to
school
and
come
home
and
had
washed
their
faces
again
and
darned
their
stockings
and
mended
freddie
perkins
trousers
he
tore
them
every
day
of
his
life
and
learned
my
lessons
in
between
i
was
ready
to
go
to
bed
and
i
notice
any
lack
of
social
intercourse
but
after
two
years
in
a
conversational
college
i
do
miss
it
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
somebody
who
speaks
my
language
i
really
believe
i
finished
daddy
nothing
else
occurs
to
me
at
the
moment
i
try
to
write
a
longer
letter
next
time
yours
always
judy
ps
the
lettuce
has
done
at
all
well
this
year
it
was
so
dry
early
in
the
season
august
well
daddy
master
jervie
here
and
such
a
nice
time
as
having
at
least
i
am
and
i
think
he
is
too
he
has
been
here
ten
days
and
he
does
show
any
signs
of
going
the
way
semple
pampers
that
man
is
scandalous
if
she
indulged
him
as
much
when
he
was
a
baby
i
do
know
how
he
ever
turned
out
so
well
he
and
i
eat
at
a
little
table
set
on
the
side
porch
or
sometimes
under
the
trees
or
when
it
rains
or
is
cold
in
the
best
parlour
he
just
picks
out
the
spot
he
wants
to
eat
in
and
carrie
trots
after
him
with
the
table
then
if
it
has
been
an
awful
nuisance
and
she
has
had
to
carry
the
dishes
very
far
she
finds
a
dollar
under
the
sugar
bowl
he
is
an
awfully
companionable
sort
of
man
though
you
would
never
believe
it
to
see
him
casually
he
looks
at
first
glance
like
a
true
pendleton
but
he
is
in
the
least
he
is
just
as
simple
and
unaffected
and
sweet
as
he
can
be
that
seems
a
funny
way
to
describe
a
man
but
it
true
he
extremely
nice
with
the
farmers
around
here
he
meets
them
in
a
sort
of
fashion
that
disarms
them
immediately
they
were
very
suspicious
at
first
they
did
care
for
his
clothes
and
i
will
say
that
his
clothes
are
rather
amazing
he
wears
knickerbockers
and
pleated
jackets
and
white
flannels
and
riding
clothes
with
puffed
trousers
whenever
he
comes
down
in
anything
new
semple
beaming
with
pride
walks
around
and
views
him
from
every
angle
and
urges
him
to
be
careful
where
he
sits
down
she
is
so
afraid
he
will
pick
up
some
dust
it
bores
him
dreadfully
he
always
saying
to
her
along
lizzie
and
tend
to
your
work
you
ca
boss
me
any
longer
i
grown
up
it
awfully
funny
to
think
of
that
great
big
man
nearly
as
as
you
daddy
ever
sitting
in
semple
lap
and
having
his
face
washed
particularly
funny
when
you
see
her
lap
she
has
two
laps
now
and
three
chins
but
he
says
that
once
she
was
thin
and
wiry
and
spry
and
could
run
faster
than
he
such
a
lot
of
adventures
we
having
we
explored
the
country
for
miles
and
i
learned
to
fish
with
funny
little
flies
made
of
feathers
also
to
shoot
with
a
rifle
and
a
revolver
also
to
ride
horseback
there
an
astonishing
amount
of
life
in
old
grove
we
fed
him
on
oats
for
three
days
and
he
shied
at
a
calf
and
almost
ran
away
with
me
wednesday
we
climbed
sky
hill
monday
afternoon
that
a
mountain
near
here
not
an
awfully
high
mountain
perhaps
no
snow
on
the
summit
but
at
least
you
are
pretty
breathless
when
you
reach
the
top
the
lower
slopes
are
covered
with
woods
but
the
top
is
just
piled
rocks
and
open
moor
we
stayed
up
for
the
sunset
and
built
a
fire
and
cooked
our
supper
master
jervie
did
the
cooking
he
said
he
knew
how
better
than
me
and
he
did
too
because
he
used
to
camping
then
we
came
down
by
moonlight
and
when
we
reached
the
wood
trail
where
it
was
dark
by
the
light
of
an
electric
bulb
that
he
had
in
his
pocket
it
was
such
fun
he
laughed
and
joked
all
the
way
and
talked
about
interesting
things
he
read
all
the
books
i
ever
read
and
a
lot
of
others
besides
it
astonishing
how
many
different
things
he
knows
we
went
for
a
long
tramp
this
morning
and
got
caught
in
a
storm
our
clothes
were
drenched
before
we
reached
home
but
our
spirits
not
even
damp
you
should
have
seen
semple
face
when
we
dripped
into
her
kitchen
master
jervie
miss
judy
you
are
soaked
through
dear
dear
what
shall
i
do
that
nice
new
coat
is
perfectly
ruined
she
was
awfully
funny
you
would
have
thought
that
we
were
ten
years
old
and
she
a
distracted
mother
i
was
afraid
for
a
while
that
we
were
going
to
get
any
jam
for
tea
saturday
i
started
this
letter
ages
ago
but
i
have
had
a
second
to
finish
it
is
this
a
nice
thought
from
stevenson
the
world
is
so
full
of
a
number
of
things
i
am
sure
we
should
all
be
as
happy
as
kings
it
true
you
know
the
world
is
full
of
happiness
and
plenty
to
go
round
if
you
are
only
willing
to
take
the
kind
that
comes
your
way
the
whole
secret
is
in
being
pliable
in
the
country
especially
there
are
such
a
lot
of
entertaining
things
i
can
walk
over
everybody
land
and
look
at
everybody
view
and
dabble
in
everybody
brook
and
enjoy
it
just
as
much
as
though
i
owned
the
land
and
with
no
taxes
to
pay
it
sunday
night
now
about
eleven
and
i
am
supposed
to
be
getting
some
beauty
sleep
but
i
had
black
coffee
for
dinner
so
no
beauty
sleep
for
me
this
morning
said
semple
to
pendleton
with
a
very
determined
accent
have
to
leave
here
at
a
quarter
past
ten
in
order
to
get
to
church
by
eleven
well
lizzie
said
master
jervie
have
the
buggy
ready
and
if
i
not
dressed
just
go
on
without
waiting
wait
said
she
you
please
said
he
do
keep
the
horses
standing
too
long
then
while
she
was
dressing
he
told
carrie
to
pack
up
a
lunch
and
he
told
me
to
scramble
into
my
walking
clothes
and
we
slipped
out
the
back
way
and
went
fishing
it
discommoded
the
household
dreadfully
because
lock
willow
of
a
sunday
dines
at
two
but
he
ordered
dinner
at
seven
he
orders
meals
whenever
he
chooses
you
would
think
the
place
were
a
restaurant
and
that
kept
carrie
and
amasai
from
going
driving
but
he
said
it
was
all
the
better
because
it
was
proper
for
them
to
go
driving
without
a
chaperon
and
anyway
he
wanted
the
horses
himself
to
take
me
driving
did
you
ever
hear
anything
so
funny
and
poor
semple
believes
that
people
who
go
fishing
on
sundays
go
afterwards
to
a
sizzling
hot
hell
she
is
awfully
troubled
to
think
that
she
did
train
him
better
when
he
was
small
and
helpless
and
she
had
the
chance
besides
she
wished
to
show
him
off
in
church
anyway
we
had
our
fishing
he
caught
four
little
ones
and
we
cooked
them
on
a
for
lunch
they
kept
falling
off
our
spiked
sticks
into
the
fire
so
they
tasted
a
little
ashy
but
we
ate
them
we
got
home
at
four
and
went
driving
at
five
and
had
dinner
at
seven
and
at
ten
i
was
sent
to
bed
and
here
i
am
writing
to
you
i
am
getting
a
little
sleepy
though
good
night
here
is
a
picture
of
the
one
fish
i
caught
ship
ahoy
avast
belay
yo
ho
ho
and
a
bottle
of
rum
guess
what
reading
our
conversation
these
past
two
days
has
been
nautical
and
piratical
is
treasure
island
fun
did
you
ever
read
it
or
it
written
when
you
were
a
boy
stevenson
only
got
thirty
pounds
for
the
serial
rights
i
do
believe
it
pays
to
be
a
great
author
maybe
i
be
a
excuse
me
for
filling
my
letters
so
full
of
stevenson
my
mind
is
very
much
engaged
with
him
at
present
he
comprises
lock
willow
library
i
been
writing
this
letter
for
two
weeks
and
i
think
it
about
long
enough
never
say
daddy
that
i
do
give
details
i
wish
you
were
here
too
we
all
have
such
a
jolly
time
together
i
like
my
different
friends
to
know
each
other
i
wanted
to
ask
pendleton
if
he
knew
you
in
new
york
i
should
think
he
might
you
must
move
in
about
the
same
exalted
social
circles
and
you
are
both
interested
in
reforms
and
things
but
i
could
for
i
do
know
your
real
name
it
the
silliest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
not
to
know
your
name
lippett
warned
me
that
you
were
eccentric
i
should
think
so
affectionately
judy
ps
on
reading
this
over
i
find
that
it
is
all
stevenson
there
are
one
or
two
glancing
references
to
master
jervie
september
dear
daddy
he
has
gone
and
we
are
missing
him
when
you
get
accustomed
to
people
or
places
or
ways
of
living
and
then
have
them
snatched
away
it
does
leave
an
awfully
empty
gnawing
sort
of
sensation
i
finding
semple
conversation
pretty
unseasoned
food
college
opens
in
two
weeks
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
begin
work
again
i
have
worked
quite
a
lot
this
summer
though
six
short
stories
and
seven
poems
those
i
sent
to
the
magazines
all
came
back
with
the
most
courteous
promptitude
but
i
do
mind
it
good
practice
master
jervie
read
them
he
brought
in
the
post
so
i
could
help
his
knowing
and
he
said
they
were
dreadful
they
showed
that
i
have
the
slightest
idea
of
what
i
was
talking
about
master
jervie
does
let
politeness
interfere
with
truth
but
the
last
one
i
did
just
a
little
sketch
laid
in
college
he
said
was
bad
and
he
had
it
typewritten
and
i
sent
it
to
a
magazine
they
had
it
two
weeks
maybe
they
thinking
it
over
you
should
see
the
sky
there
the
queerest
light
over
everything
we
going
to
have
a
storm
it
commenced
just
that
moment
with
tremendously
big
drops
and
all
the
shutters
banging
i
had
to
run
to
close
the
windows
while
carrie
flew
to
the
attic
with
an
armful
of
milk
pans
to
put
under
the
places
where
the
roof
leaks
and
then
just
as
i
was
resuming
my
pen
i
remembered
that
i
left
a
cushion
and
rug
and
hat
and
matthew
arnold
poems
under
a
tree
in
the
orchard
so
i
dashed
out
to
get
them
all
quite
soaked
the
red
cover
of
the
poems
had
run
into
the
inside
dover
beach
in
the
future
will
be
washed
by
pink
waves
a
storm
is
awfully
disturbing
in
the
country
you
are
always
having
to
think
of
so
many
things
that
are
out
of
doors
and
getting
spoiled
thursday
daddy
daddy
what
do
you
think
the
postman
has
just
come
with
two
letters
my
story
is
accepted
alors
i
an
author
a
letter
from
the
college
secretary
i
to
have
a
scholarship
for
two
years
that
will
cover
board
and
tuition
it
was
founded
for
proficiency
in
english
with
general
excellency
in
other
lines
and
i
won
it
i
applied
for
it
before
i
left
but
i
did
have
an
idea
i
get
it
on
account
of
my
freshman
bad
work
in
maths
and
latin
but
it
seems
i
made
it
up
i
am
awfully
glad
daddy
because
now
i
wo
be
such
a
burden
to
you
the
monthly
allowance
will
be
all
need
and
maybe
i
can
earn
that
with
writing
or
tutoring
or
something
i
longing
to
go
back
and
begin
work
yours
ever
jerusha
abbott
author
of
when
the
sophomores
won
the
game
for
sale
at
all
news
stands
price
ten
cents
september
dear
back
at
college
again
and
an
upper
classman
our
study
is
better
than
ever
this
year
faces
the
south
with
two
huge
windows
and
oh
so
furnished
julia
with
an
unlimited
allowance
arrived
two
days
early
and
was
attacked
with
a
fever
for
settling
we
have
new
wall
paper
and
oriental
rugs
and
mahogany
chairs
not
painted
mahogany
which
made
us
sufficiently
happy
last
year
but
real
it
very
gorgeous
but
i
do
feel
as
though
i
belonged
in
it
nervous
all
the
time
for
fear
i
get
an
ink
spot
in
the
wrong
place
and
daddy
i
found
your
letter
waiting
for
me
pardon
i
mean
your
secretary
will
you
kindly
convey
to
me
a
comprehensible
reason
why
i
should
not
accept
that
scholarship
i
do
understand
your
objection
in
the
least
but
anyway
it
wo
do
the
slightest
good
for
you
to
object
for
i
already
accepted
it
and
i
am
not
going
to
change
that
sounds
a
little
impertinent
but
i
do
mean
it
so
i
suppose
you
feel
that
when
you
set
out
to
educate
me
you
like
to
finish
the
work
and
put
a
neat
period
in
the
shape
of
a
diploma
at
the
end
but
look
at
it
just
a
second
from
my
point
of
view
i
shall
owe
my
education
to
you
just
as
much
as
though
i
let
you
pay
for
the
whole
of
it
but
i
wo
be
quite
so
much
indebted
i
know
that
you
do
want
me
to
return
the
money
but
nevertheless
i
am
going
to
want
to
do
it
if
i
possibly
can
and
winning
this
scholarship
makes
it
so
much
easier
i
was
expecting
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
in
paying
my
debts
but
now
i
shall
only
have
to
spend
of
the
rest
of
it
i
hope
you
understand
my
position
and
wo
be
cross
the
allowance
i
shall
still
most
gratefully
accept
it
requires
an
allowance
to
live
up
to
julia
and
her
furniture
i
wish
that
she
had
been
reared
to
simpler
tastes
or
else
that
she
were
not
my
this
is
much
of
a
letter
i
meant
to
have
written
a
lot
but
been
hemming
four
window
curtains
and
three
portieres
i
glad
you
ca
see
the
length
of
the
stitches
and
polishing
a
brass
desk
set
with
tooth
powder
very
uphill
work
and
sawing
off
picture
wire
with
manicure
scissors
and
unpacking
four
boxes
of
books
and
putting
away
two
trunkfuls
of
clothes
it
does
seem
believable
that
jerusha
abbott
owns
two
trunks
full
of
clothes
but
she
does
and
welcoming
back
fifty
dear
friends
in
between
opening
day
is
a
joyous
occasion
good
night
daddy
dear
and
do
be
annoyed
because
your
chick
is
wanting
to
scratch
for
herself
she
growing
up
into
an
awfully
energetic
little
hen
with
a
very
determined
cluck
and
lots
of
beautiful
feathers
all
due
to
you
affectionately
judy
september
dear
daddy
are
you
still
harping
on
that
scholarship
i
never
knew
a
man
so
obstinate
and
stubborn
and
unreasonable
and
tenacious
and
and
as
you
you
prefer
that
i
should
not
be
accepting
favours
from
strangers
strangers
and
what
are
you
pray
is
there
anyone
in
the
world
that
i
know
less
i
should
recognize
you
if
i
met
you
in
the
street
now
you
see
if
you
had
been
a
sane
sensible
person
and
had
written
nice
cheering
fatherly
letters
to
your
little
judy
and
had
come
occasionally
and
patted
her
on
the
head
and
had
said
you
were
glad
she
was
such
a
good
girl
then
perhaps
she
would
have
flouted
you
in
your
old
age
but
would
have
obeyed
your
slightest
wish
like
the
dutiful
daughter
she
was
meant
to
be
strangers
indeed
you
live
in
a
glass
house
smith
and
besides
this
is
a
favour
it
like
a
prize
i
earned
it
by
hard
work
if
nobody
had
been
good
enough
in
english
the
committee
would
have
awarded
the
scholarship
some
years
they
do
also
but
what
the
use
of
arguing
with
a
man
you
belong
smith
to
a
sex
devoid
of
a
sense
of
logic
to
bring
a
man
into
line
there
are
just
two
methods
one
must
either
coax
or
be
disagreeable
i
scorn
to
coax
men
for
what
i
wish
therefore
i
must
be
disagreeable
i
refuse
sir
to
give
up
the
scholarship
and
if
you
make
any
more
fuss
i
wo
accept
the
monthly
allowance
either
but
will
wear
myself
into
a
nervous
wreck
tutoring
stupid
freshmen
that
is
my
ultimatum
and
listen
i
have
a
further
thought
since
you
are
so
afraid
that
by
taking
this
scholarship
i
am
depriving
someone
else
of
an
education
i
know
a
way
out
you
can
apply
the
money
that
you
would
have
spent
for
me
towards
educating
some
other
little
girl
from
the
john
grier
home
do
you
think
that
a
nice
idea
only
daddy
educate
the
new
girl
as
much
as
you
choose
but
please
do
like
her
any
better
than
me
i
trust
that
your
secretary
wo
be
hurt
because
i
pay
so
little
attention
to
the
suggestions
offered
in
his
letter
but
i
ca
help
it
if
he
is
he
a
spoiled
child
daddy
i
meekly
given
in
to
his
whims
heretofore
but
this
time
i
intend
to
be
firm
yours
with
a
mind
completely
and
irrevocably
and
jerusha
abbott
november
dear
i
started
down
town
today
to
buy
a
bottle
of
shoe
blacking
and
some
collars
and
the
material
for
a
new
blouse
and
a
jar
of
violet
cream
and
a
cake
of
castile
soap
all
very
necessary
i
could
be
happy
another
day
without
them
and
when
i
tried
to
pay
the
car
fare
i
found
that
i
had
left
my
purse
in
the
pocket
of
my
other
coat
so
i
had
to
get
out
and
take
the
next
car
and
was
late
for
gymnasium
it
a
dreadful
thing
to
have
no
memory
and
two
coats
julia
pendleton
has
invited
me
to
visit
her
for
the
christmas
holidays
how
does
that
strike
you
smith
fancy
jerusha
abbott
of
the
john
grier
home
sitting
at
the
tables
of
the
rich
i
do
know
why
julia
wants
me
she
seems
to
be
getting
quite
attached
to
me
of
late
i
should
to
tell
the
truth
very
much
prefer
going
to
sallie
but
julia
asked
me
first
so
if
i
go
anywhere
it
must
be
to
new
york
instead
of
to
worcester
i
rather
awed
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
pendletons
en
masse
and
also
i
have
to
get
a
lot
of
new
clothes
so
daddy
dear
if
you
write
that
you
would
prefer
having
me
remain
quietly
at
college
i
will
bow
to
your
wishes
with
my
usual
sweet
docility
i
engaged
at
odd
moments
with
the
life
and
letters
of
thomas
huxley
it
makes
nice
light
reading
to
pick
up
between
times
do
you
know
what
an
archaeopteryx
is
it
a
bird
and
a
stereognathus
not
sure
myself
but
i
think
it
a
missing
link
like
a
bird
with
teeth
or
a
lizard
with
wings
no
it
is
either
i
just
looked
in
the
book
it
a
mesozoic
mammal
i
elected
economics
this
year
very
illuminating
subject
when
i
finish
that
i
going
to
take
charity
and
reform
then
mr
trustee
i
know
just
how
an
orphan
asylum
ought
to
be
run
do
you
think
i
make
an
admirable
voter
if
i
had
my
rights
i
was
last
week
this
is
an
awfully
wasteful
country
to
throw
away
such
an
honest
educated
conscientious
intelligent
citizen
as
i
would
be
yours
always
judy
december
dear
thank
you
for
permission
to
visit
julia
i
take
it
that
silence
means
consent
such
a
social
whirl
as
we
been
having
the
founder
dance
came
last
week
this
was
the
first
year
that
any
of
us
could
attend
only
upper
classmen
being
allowed
i
invited
jimmie
mcbride
and
sallie
invited
his
at
princeton
who
visited
them
last
summer
at
their
camp
an
awfully
nice
man
with
red
hair
and
julia
invited
a
man
from
new
york
not
very
exciting
but
socially
irreproachable
he
is
connected
with
the
de
la
mater
chichesters
perhaps
that
means
something
to
you
it
illuminate
me
to
any
extent
however
our
guests
came
friday
afternoon
in
time
for
tea
in
the
senior
corridor
and
then
dashed
down
to
the
hotel
for
dinner
the
hotel
was
so
full
that
they
slept
in
rows
on
the
billiard
tables
they
say
jimmie
mcbride
says
that
the
next
time
he
is
bidden
to
a
social
event
in
this
college
he
is
going
to
bring
one
of
their
adirondack
tents
and
pitch
it
on
the
campus
at
they
came
back
for
the
president
reception
and
dance
our
functions
commence
early
we
had
the
men
cards
all
made
out
ahead
of
time
and
after
every
dance
we
leave
them
in
groups
under
the
letter
that
stood
for
their
names
so
that
they
could
be
readily
found
by
their
next
partners
jimmie
mcbride
for
example
would
stand
patiently
under
until
he
was
claimed
at
least
he
ought
to
have
stood
patiently
but
he
kept
wandering
off
and
getting
mixed
with
and
and
all
sorts
of
letters
i
found
him
a
very
difficult
guest
he
was
sulky
because
he
had
only
three
dances
with
me
he
said
he
was
bashful
about
dancing
with
girls
he
did
know
the
next
morning
we
had
a
glee
club
concert
and
who
do
you
think
wrote
the
funny
new
song
composed
for
the
occasion
it
the
truth
she
did
oh
i
tell
you
daddy
your
little
foundling
is
getting
to
be
quite
a
prominent
person
anyway
our
gay
two
days
were
great
fun
and
i
think
the
men
enjoyed
it
some
of
them
were
awfully
perturbed
at
first
at
the
prospect
of
facing
one
thousand
girls
but
they
got
acclimated
very
quickly
our
two
princeton
men
had
a
beautiful
time
at
least
they
politely
said
they
had
and
they
invited
us
to
their
dance
next
spring
accepted
so
please
do
object
daddy
dear
julia
and
sallie
and
i
all
had
new
dresses
do
you
want
to
hear
about
them
julia
was
cream
satin
and
gold
embroidery
and
she
wore
purple
orchids
it
was
a
dream
and
came
from
paris
and
cost
a
million
dollars
sallie
was
pale
blue
trimmed
with
persian
embroidery
and
went
beautifully
with
red
hair
it
did
cost
quite
a
million
but
was
just
as
effective
as
julia
mine
was
pale
pink
crepe
de
chine
trimmed
with
ecru
lace
and
rose
satin
and
i
carried
crimson
roses
which
mcb
sent
sallie
having
told
him
what
colour
to
get
and
we
all
had
satin
slippers
and
silk
stockings
and
chiffon
scarfs
to
match
you
must
be
deeply
impressed
by
these
millinery
details
one
ca
help
thinking
daddy
what
a
colourless
life
a
man
is
forced
to
lead
when
one
reflects
that
chiffon
and
venetian
point
and
hand
embroidery
and
irish
crochet
are
to
him
mere
empty
words
whereas
a
woman
whether
she
is
interested
in
babies
or
microbes
or
husbands
or
poetry
or
servants
or
parallelograms
or
gardens
or
plato
or
bridge
is
fundamentally
and
always
interested
in
clothes
it
the
one
touch
of
nature
that
makes
the
whole
world
kin
that
is
original
i
got
it
out
of
one
of
shakespeare
plays
however
to
resume
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
a
secret
that
lately
discovered
and
will
you
promise
not
to
think
me
vain
then
listen
i
pretty
i
am
really
i
be
an
awful
idiot
not
to
know
it
with
three
in
the
room
a
friend
ps
this
is
one
of
those
wicked
anonymous
letters
you
read
about
in
novels
december
dear
i
just
a
moment
because
i
must
attend
two
classes
pack
a
trunk
and
a
and
catch
the
train
but
i
could
go
without
sending
a
word
to
let
you
know
how
much
i
appreciate
my
christmas
box
i
love
the
furs
and
the
necklace
and
the
liberty
scarf
and
the
gloves
and
handkerchiefs
and
books
and
purse
and
most
of
all
i
love
you
but
daddy
you
have
no
business
to
spoil
me
this
way
i
only
human
and
a
girl
at
that
how
can
i
keep
my
mind
sternly
fixed
on
a
studious
career
when
you
deflect
me
with
such
worldly
frivolities
i
have
strong
suspicions
now
as
to
which
one
of
the
john
grier
trustees
used
to
give
the
christmas
tree
and
the
sunday
he
was
nameless
but
by
his
works
i
know
him
you
deserve
to
be
happy
for
all
the
good
things
you
do
goodbye
and
a
very
merry
christmas
yours
always
judy
ps
i
am
sending
a
slight
token
too
do
you
think
you
would
like
her
if
you
knew
her
january
i
meant
to
write
to
you
from
the
city
daddy
but
new
york
is
an
engrossing
place
i
had
an
interesting
and
illuminating
time
but
i
glad
i
belong
to
such
a
family
i
should
truly
rather
have
the
john
grier
home
for
a
background
whatever
the
drawbacks
of
my
bringing
up
there
was
at
least
no
pretence
about
it
i
know
now
what
people
mean
when
they
say
they
are
weighed
down
by
things
the
material
atmosphere
of
that
house
was
crushing
i
did
draw
a
deep
breath
until
i
was
on
an
express
train
coming
back
all
the
furniture
was
carved
and
upholstered
and
gorgeous
the
people
i
met
were
beautifully
dressed
and
and
but
it
the
truth
daddy
i
never
heard
one
word
of
real
talk
from
the
time
we
arrived
until
we
left
i
think
an
idea
ever
entered
the
front
door
pendleton
never
thinks
of
anything
but
jewels
and
dressmakers
and
social
engagements
she
did
seem
a
different
kind
of
mother
from
mcbride
if
i
ever
marry
and
have
a
family
i
going
to
make
them
as
exactly
like
the
mcbrides
as
i
can
not
for
all
the
money
in
the
world
would
i
ever
let
any
children
of
mine
develop
into
pendletons
maybe
it
is
polite
to
criticize
people
you
been
visiting
if
it
is
please
excuse
this
is
very
confidential
between
you
and
me
i
only
saw
master
jervie
once
when
he
called
at
tea
time
and
then
i
did
have
a
chance
to
speak
to
him
alone
it
was
really
disappointing
after
our
nice
time
last
summer
i
do
think
he
cares
much
for
his
relatives
and
i
am
sure
they
do
care
much
for
him
julia
mother
says
he
unbalanced
he
a
socialist
except
thank
heaven
he
does
let
his
hair
grow
and
wear
red
ties
she
imagine
where
he
picked
up
his
queer
ideas
the
family
have
been
church
of
england
for
generations
he
throws
away
his
money
on
every
sort
of
crazy
reform
instead
of
spending
it
on
such
sensible
things
as
yachts
and
automobiles
and
polo
ponies
he
does
buy
candy
with
it
though
he
sent
julia
and
me
each
a
box
for
christmas
you
know
i
think
i
be
a
socialist
too
you
would
mind
would
you
daddy
they
quite
different
from
anarchists
they
believe
in
blowing
people
up
probably
i
am
one
by
rights
i
belong
to
the
proletariat
i
have
determined
yet
just
which
kind
i
am
going
to
be
i
will
look
into
the
subject
over
sunday
and
declare
my
principles
in
my
next
i
seen
loads
of
theatres
and
hotels
and
beautiful
houses
my
mind
is
a
confused
jumble
of
onyx
and
gilding
and
mosaic
floors
and
palms
i
still
pretty
breathless
but
i
am
glad
to
get
back
to
college
and
my
books
i
believe
that
i
really
am
a
student
this
atmosphere
of
academic
calm
i
find
more
bracing
than
new
york
college
is
a
very
satisfying
sort
of
life
the
books
and
study
and
regular
classes
keep
you
alive
mentally
and
then
when
your
mind
gets
tired
you
have
the
gymnasium
and
outdoor
athletics
and
always
plenty
of
congenial
friends
who
are
thinking
about
the
same
things
you
are
we
spend
a
whole
evening
in
nothing
but
talk
talk
talk
and
go
to
bed
with
a
very
uplifted
feeling
as
though
we
had
settled
permanently
some
pressing
world
problems
and
filling
in
every
crevice
there
is
always
such
a
lot
of
nonsense
just
silly
jokes
about
the
little
things
that
come
up
but
very
satisfying
we
do
appreciate
our
own
witticisms
it
is
the
great
big
pleasures
that
count
the
most
it
making
a
great
deal
out
of
the
little
ones
i
discovered
the
true
secret
of
happiness
daddy
and
that
is
to
live
in
the
now
not
to
be
for
ever
regretting
the
past
or
anticipating
the
future
but
to
get
the
most
that
you
can
out
of
this
very
instant
it
like
farming
you
can
have
extensive
farming
and
intensive
farming
well
i
am
going
to
have
intensive
living
after
this
i
going
to
enjoy
every
second
and
going
to
know
i
enjoying
it
while
i
enjoying
it
most
people
live
they
just
race
they
are
trying
to
reach
some
goal
far
away
on
the
horizon
and
in
the
heat
of
the
going
they
get
so
breathless
and
panting
that
they
lose
all
sight
of
the
beautiful
tranquil
country
they
are
passing
through
and
then
the
first
thing
they
know
they
are
old
and
worn
out
and
it
does
make
any
difference
whether
reached
the
goal
or
not
i
decided
to
sit
down
by
the
way
and
pile
up
a
lot
of
little
happinesses
even
if
i
never
become
a
great
author
did
you
ever
know
such
a
philosopheress
as
i
am
developing
into
yours
ever
judy
ps
it
raining
cats
and
dogs
tonight
two
puppies
and
a
kitten
have
just
landed
on
the
dear
comrade
hooray
i
a
fabian
that
a
socialist
who
willing
to
wait
we
do
want
the
social
revolution
to
come
tomorrow
morning
it
would
be
too
upsetting
we
want
it
to
come
very
gradually
in
the
distant
future
when
we
shall
all
be
prepared
and
able
to
sustain
the
shock
in
the
meantime
we
must
be
getting
ready
by
instituting
industrial
educational
and
orphan
asylum
reforms
yours
with
fraternal
love
judy
monday
hour
february
dear
do
be
insulted
because
this
is
so
short
it
is
a
letter
just
a
line
to
say
that
i
going
to
write
a
letter
pretty
soon
when
examinations
are
over
it
is
not
only
necessary
that
i
pass
but
pass
well
i
have
a
scholarship
to
live
up
to
yours
studying
hard
j
a
march
dear
president
cuyler
made
a
speech
this
evening
about
the
modern
generation
being
flippant
and
superficial
he
says
that
we
are
losing
the
old
ideals
of
earnest
endeavour
and
true
scholarship
and
particularly
is
this
noticeable
in
our
disrespectful
attitude
towards
organized
authority
we
no
longer
pay
a
seemly
deference
to
our
superiors
i
came
away
from
chapel
very
sober
am
i
too
familiar
daddy
ought
i
to
treat
you
with
more
dignity
and
aloofness
yes
i
sure
i
ought
i
begin
again
my
dear
smith
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
i
passed
successfully
my
examinations
and
am
now
commencing
work
in
the
new
semester
i
am
leaving
chemistry
having
completed
the
course
in
qualitative
analysis
and
am
entering
upon
the
study
of
biology
i
approach
this
subject
with
some
hesitation
as
i
understand
that
we
dissect
angleworms
and
frogs
an
extremely
interesting
and
valuable
lecture
was
given
in
the
chapel
last
week
upon
roman
remains
in
southern
france
i
have
never
listened
to
a
more
illuminating
exposition
of
the
subject
we
are
reading
wordsworth
tintern
abbey
in
connection
with
our
course
in
english
literature
what
an
exquisite
work
it
is
and
how
adequately
it
embodies
his
conceptions
of
pantheism
the
romantic
movement
of
the
early
part
of
the
last
century
exemplified
in
the
works
of
such
poets
as
shelley
byron
keats
and
wordsworth
appeals
to
me
very
much
more
than
the
classical
period
that
preceded
it
speaking
of
poetry
have
you
ever
read
that
charming
little
thing
of
tennyson
called
locksley
hall
i
am
attending
gymnasium
very
regularly
of
late
a
proctor
system
has
been
devised
and
failure
to
comply
with
the
rules
causes
a
great
deal
of
inconvenience
the
gymnasium
is
equipped
with
a
very
beautiful
swimming
tank
of
cement
and
marble
the
gift
of
a
former
graduate
my
miss
mcbride
has
given
me
her
it
shrank
so
that
she
can
no
longer
wear
it
and
i
am
about
to
begin
swimming
lessons
we
had
delicious
pink
for
dessert
last
night
only
vegetable
dyes
are
used
in
colouring
the
food
the
college
is
very
much
opposed
both
from
aesthetic
and
hygienic
motives
to
the
use
of
aniline
dyes
the
weather
of
late
has
been
ideal
bright
sunshine
and
clouds
interspersed
with
a
few
welcome
i
and
my
companions
have
enjoyed
our
walks
to
and
from
classes
particularly
from
trusting
my
dear
smith
that
this
will
find
you
in
your
usual
good
health
i
remain
most
cordially
yours
jerusha
abbott
april
dear
daddy
spring
has
come
again
you
should
see
how
lovely
the
campus
is
i
think
you
might
come
and
look
at
it
for
yourself
master
jervie
dropped
in
again
last
friday
but
he
chose
a
most
unpropitious
time
for
sallie
and
julia
and
i
were
just
running
to
catch
a
train
and
where
do
you
think
we
were
going
to
princeton
to
attend
a
dance
and
a
ball
game
if
you
please
i
did
ask
you
if
i
might
go
because
i
had
a
feeling
that
your
secretary
would
say
no
but
it
was
entirely
regular
we
had
from
college
and
mcbride
chaperoned
us
we
had
a
charming
time
but
i
shall
have
to
omit
details
they
are
too
many
and
complicated
saturday
up
before
dawn
the
night
watchman
called
us
six
of
us
and
we
made
coffee
in
a
chafing
dish
you
never
saw
so
many
grounds
and
walked
two
miles
to
the
top
of
one
tree
hill
to
see
the
sun
rise
we
had
to
scramble
up
the
last
slope
the
sun
almost
beat
us
and
perhaps
you
think
we
did
bring
back
appetites
to
breakfast
dear
me
daddy
i
seem
to
have
a
very
ejaculatory
style
today
this
page
is
peppered
with
exclamations
i
meant
to
have
written
a
lot
about
the
budding
trees
and
the
new
cinder
path
in
the
athletic
field
and
the
awful
lesson
we
have
in
biology
for
tomorrow
and
the
new
canoes
on
the
lake
and
catherine
prentiss
who
has
pneumonia
and
prexy
angora
kitten
that
strayed
from
home
and
has
been
boarding
in
fergussen
hall
for
two
weeks
until
a
chambermaid
reported
it
and
about
my
three
new
dresses
white
and
pink
and
blue
polka
dots
with
a
hat
to
match
but
i
am
too
sleepy
i
am
always
making
this
an
excuse
am
i
not
but
a
girls
college
is
a
busy
place
and
we
do
get
tired
by
the
end
of
the
day
particularly
when
the
day
begins
at
dawn
affectionately
judy
may
dear
is
it
good
manners
when
you
get
into
a
car
just
to
stare
straight
ahead
and
not
see
anybody
else
a
very
beautiful
lady
in
a
very
beautiful
velvet
dress
got
into
the
car
today
and
without
the
slightest
expression
sat
for
fifteen
minutes
and
looked
at
a
sign
advertising
suspenders
it
does
seem
polite
to
ignore
everybody
else
as
though
you
were
the
only
important
person
present
anyway
you
miss
a
lot
while
she
was
absorbing
that
silly
sign
i
was
studying
a
whole
car
full
of
interesting
human
beings
the
accompanying
illustration
is
hereby
reproduced
for
the
first
time
it
looks
like
a
spider
on
the
end
of
a
string
but
it
is
at
all
it
a
picture
of
me
learning
to
swim
in
the
tank
in
the
gymnasium
the
instructor
hooks
a
rope
into
a
ring
in
the
back
of
my
belt
and
runs
it
through
a
pulley
in
the
ceiling
it
would
be
a
beautiful
system
if
one
had
perfect
confidence
in
the
probity
of
instructor
i
always
afraid
though
that
she
will
let
the
rope
get
slack
so
i
keep
one
anxious
eye
on
her
and
swim
with
the
other
and
with
this
divided
interest
i
do
not
make
the
progress
that
i
otherwise
might
very
miscellaneous
weather
we
having
of
late
it
was
raining
when
i
commenced
and
now
the
sun
is
shining
sallie
and
i
are
going
out
to
play
tennis
thereby
gaining
exemption
from
gym
a
week
later
i
should
have
finished
this
letter
long
ago
but
i
did
you
mind
do
you
daddy
if
i
not
very
regular
i
really
do
love
to
write
to
you
it
gives
me
such
a
respectable
feeling
of
having
some
family
would
you
like
me
to
tell
you
something
you
are
not
the
only
man
to
whom
i
write
letters
there
are
two
others
i
have
been
receiving
beautiful
long
letters
this
winter
from
master
jervie
with
typewritten
envelopes
so
julia
wo
recognize
the
writing
did
you
ever
hear
anything
so
shocking
and
every
week
or
so
a
very
scrawly
epistle
usually
on
yellow
tablet
paper
arrives
from
princeton
all
of
which
i
answer
with
promptness
so
you
see
i
am
not
so
different
from
other
girls
i
get
letters
too
did
i
tell
you
that
i
have
been
elected
a
member
of
the
senior
dramatic
club
very
recherche
organization
only
members
out
of
one
thousand
do
you
think
as
a
consistent
socialist
that
i
ought
to
belong
what
do
you
suppose
is
at
present
engaging
my
attention
in
sociology
i
am
writing
figurez
vous
a
paper
on
the
care
of
dependent
children
the
professor
shuffled
up
his
subjects
and
dealt
them
out
promiscuously
and
that
fell
to
me
drole
ca
pas
there
goes
the
gong
for
dinner
i
post
this
as
i
pass
the
box
affectionately
j
june
dear
daddy
very
busy
time
commencement
in
ten
days
examinations
tomorrow
lots
of
studying
lots
of
packing
and
the
outdoor
world
so
lovely
that
it
hurts
you
to
stay
inside
but
never
mind
vacation
coming
julia
is
going
abroad
this
summer
it
makes
the
fourth
time
no
doubt
about
it
daddy
goods
are
not
distributed
evenly
sallie
as
usual
goes
to
the
adirondacks
and
what
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
do
you
may
have
three
guesses
lock
willow
wrong
the
adirondacks
with
sallie
wrong
i
never
attempt
that
again
i
was
discouraged
last
year
ca
you
guess
anything
else
you
not
very
inventive
i
tell
you
daddy
if
you
promise
not
to
make
a
lot
of
objections
i
warn
your
secretary
in
advance
that
my
mind
is
made
up
i
am
going
to
spend
the
summer
at
the
seaside
with
a
charles
paterson
and
tutor
her
daughter
who
is
to
enter
college
in
the
autumn
i
met
her
through
the
mcbrides
and
she
is
a
very
charming
woman
i
am
to
give
lessons
in
english
and
latin
to
the
younger
daughter
too
but
i
shall
have
a
little
time
to
myself
and
i
shall
be
earning
fifty
dollars
a
month
does
that
impress
you
as
a
perfectly
exorbitant
amount
she
offered
it
i
should
have
blushed
to
ask
for
more
than
i
finish
at
magnolia
that
where
she
lives
the
first
of
september
and
shall
probably
spend
the
remaining
three
weeks
at
lock
willow
i
should
like
to
see
the
semples
again
and
all
the
friendly
animals
how
does
my
programme
strike
you
daddy
i
am
getting
quite
independent
you
see
you
have
put
me
on
my
feet
and
i
think
i
can
almost
walk
alone
by
now
princeton
commencement
and
our
examinations
exactly
coincide
which
is
an
awful
blow
sallie
and
i
did
so
want
to
get
away
in
time
for
it
but
of
course
that
is
utterly
impossible
goodbye
daddy
have
a
nice
summer
and
come
back
in
the
autumn
rested
and
ready
for
another
year
of
work
that
what
you
ought
to
be
writing
to
me
i
have
any
idea
what
you
do
in
the
summer
or
how
you
amuse
yourself
i
ca
visualize
your
surroundings
do
you
play
golf
or
hunt
or
ride
horseback
or
just
sit
in
the
sun
and
meditate
anyway
whatever
it
is
have
a
good
time
and
do
forget
judy
june
dear
daddy
this
is
the
hardest
letter
i
ever
wrote
but
i
have
decided
what
i
must
do
and
there
is
going
to
be
any
turning
back
it
is
very
sweet
and
generous
and
dear
of
you
to
wish
to
send
me
to
europe
this
summer
for
the
moment
i
was
intoxicated
by
the
idea
but
sober
second
thoughts
said
no
it
would
be
rather
illogical
of
me
to
refuse
to
take
your
money
for
college
and
then
use
it
instead
just
for
amusement
you
must
get
me
used
to
too
many
luxuries
one
does
miss
what
one
has
never
had
but
it
awfully
hard
going
without
things
after
one
has
commenced
thinking
they
are
his
hers
english
language
needs
another
pronoun
by
natural
right
living
with
sallie
and
julia
is
an
awful
strain
on
my
stoical
philosophy
they
have
both
had
things
from
the
time
they
were
babies
they
accept
happiness
as
a
matter
of
course
the
world
they
think
owes
them
everything
they
want
maybe
the
world
does
in
any
case
it
seems
to
acknowledge
the
debt
and
pay
up
but
as
for
me
it
owes
me
nothing
and
distinctly
told
me
so
in
the
beginning
i
have
no
right
to
borrow
on
credit
for
there
will
come
a
time
when
the
world
will
repudiate
my
claim
i
seem
to
be
floundering
in
a
sea
of
metaphor
but
i
hope
you
grasp
my
meaning
anyway
i
have
a
very
strong
feeling
that
the
only
honest
thing
for
me
to
do
is
to
teach
this
summer
and
begin
to
support
myself
magnolia
four
days
later
i
got
just
that
much
written
when
what
do
you
think
happened
the
maid
arrived
with
master
jervie
card
he
is
going
abroad
too
this
summer
not
with
julia
and
her
family
but
entirely
by
himself
i
told
him
that
you
had
invited
me
to
go
with
a
lady
who
is
chaperoning
a
party
of
girls
he
knows
about
you
daddy
that
is
he
knows
that
my
father
and
mother
are
dead
and
that
a
kind
gentleman
is
sending
me
to
college
i
simply
did
have
the
courage
to
tell
him
about
the
john
grier
home
and
all
the
rest
he
thinks
that
you
are
my
guardian
and
a
perfectly
legitimate
old
family
friend
i
have
never
told
him
that
i
did
know
you
that
would
seem
too
queer
anyway
he
insisted
on
my
going
to
europe
he
said
that
it
was
a
necessary
part
of
my
education
and
that
i
must
think
of
refusing
also
that
he
would
be
in
paris
at
the
same
time
and
that
we
would
run
away
from
the
chaperon
occasionally
and
have
dinner
together
at
nice
funny
foreign
restaurants
well
daddy
it
did
appeal
to
me
i
almost
weakened
if
he
had
been
so
dictatorial
maybe
i
should
have
entirely
weakened
i
can
be
enticed
step
by
step
but
i
wo
be
forced
he
said
i
was
a
silly
foolish
irrational
quixotic
idiotic
stubborn
child
those
are
a
few
of
his
abusive
adjectives
the
rest
escape
me
and
that
i
did
know
what
was
good
for
me
i
ought
to
let
older
people
judge
we
almost
quarrelled
i
am
not
sure
but
that
we
entirely
did
in
any
case
i
packed
my
trunk
fast
and
came
up
here
i
thought
better
see
my
bridges
in
flames
behind
me
before
i
finished
writing
to
you
they
are
entirely
reduced
to
ashes
now
here
i
am
at
cliff
top
the
name
of
paterson
cottage
with
my
trunk
unpacked
and
florence
the
little
one
already
struggling
with
first
declension
nouns
and
it
bids
fair
to
be
a
struggle
she
is
a
most
uncommonly
spoiled
child
i
shall
have
to
teach
her
first
how
to
study
she
has
never
in
her
life
concentrated
on
anything
more
difficult
than
soda
water
we
use
a
quiet
corner
of
the
cliffs
for
a
schoolroom
paterson
wishes
me
to
keep
them
out
of
doors
and
i
will
say
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
concentrate
with
the
blue
sea
before
me
and
ships
by
and
when
i
think
i
might
be
on
one
sailing
off
to
foreign
lands
but
i
wo
let
myself
think
of
anything
but
latin
grammar
the
prepositions
a
or
ab
absque
coram
cum
de
e
or
ex
prae
pro
sine
tenus
in
subter
sub
and
super
govern
the
ablative
so
you
see
daddy
i
am
already
plunged
into
work
with
my
eyes
persistently
set
against
temptation
do
be
cross
with
me
please
and
do
think
that
i
do
not
appreciate
your
kindness
for
i
do
always
always
the
only
way
i
can
ever
repay
you
is
by
turning
out
a
very
useful
citizen
are
women
citizens
i
do
suppose
they
are
anyway
a
very
useful
person
and
when
you
look
at
me
you
can
say
gave
that
very
useful
person
to
the
world
that
sounds
well
does
it
daddy
but
i
do
wish
to
mislead
you
the
feeling
often
comes
over
me
that
i
am
not
at
all
remarkable
it
is
fun
to
plan
a
career
but
in
all
probability
i
sha
turn
out
a
bit
different
from
any
other
ordinary
person
i
may
end
by
marrying
an
undertaker
and
being
an
inspiration
to
him
in
his
work
yours
ever
judy
august
dear
my
window
looks
out
on
the
loveliest
landscape
rather
nothing
but
water
and
rocks
the
summer
goes
i
spend
the
morning
with
latin
and
english
and
algebra
and
my
two
stupid
girls
i
do
know
how
marion
is
ever
going
to
get
into
college
or
stay
in
after
she
gets
there
and
as
for
florence
she
is
hopeless
but
oh
such
a
little
beauty
i
suppose
it
matters
in
the
least
whether
they
are
stupid
or
not
so
long
as
they
are
pretty
one
ca
help
thinking
though
how
their
conversation
will
bore
their
husbands
unless
they
are
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
stupid
husbands
i
suppose
that
quite
possible
the
world
seems
to
be
filled
with
stupid
men
i
met
a
number
this
summer
in
the
afternoon
we
take
a
walk
on
the
cliffs
or
swim
if
the
tide
is
right
i
can
swim
in
salt
water
with
the
utmost
ease
you
see
my
education
is
already
being
put
to
use
a
letter
comes
from
jervis
pendleton
in
paris
rather
a
short
concise
letter
i
not
quite
forgiven
yet
for
refusing
to
follow
his
advice
however
if
he
gets
back
in
time
he
will
see
me
for
a
few
days
at
lock
willow
before
college
opens
and
if
i
am
very
nice
and
sweet
and
docile
i
shall
i
am
led
to
infer
be
received
into
favour
again
also
a
letter
from
sallie
she
wants
me
to
come
to
their
camp
for
two
weeks
in
september
must
i
ask
your
permission
or
have
i
yet
arrived
at
the
place
where
i
can
do
as

please

am
sure
i
have
i

senior

little
healthful
recreation

want

want
to
see
sallie
i
want
to
see
sallie
brother
he
going
to
teach
me

my
chief
motive
which
is
mean

master
jervie
to
arrive
at
lock
willow
and
find
me

must
show
him

than
two

whole

happy
there
jimmie
calling
for

goodbye
sorry
to
have

why
are

persistent
about
not
wanting
me
to
play
a
little
when
i
worked
all
the
summer
i
deserve
two
weeks
you
are
awfully
however
i
love
you
still
daddy
in
spite
of
all
your
faults
judy
october
dear
back
at
college
and
a
senior
also
editor
of
the
monthly
it
seem
possible
does
it
that
so
sophisticated
a
person
just
four
years
ago
was
an
inmate
of
the
john
grier
home
we
do
arrive
fast
in
america
what
do
you
think
of
this
a
note
from
master
jervie
directed
to
lock
willow
and
forwarded
here
he
sorry
but
he
finds
that
he
ca
get
up
there
this
autumn
he
has
accepted
an
invitation
to
go
yachting
with
some
friends
hopes
i
had
a
nice
summer
and
am
enjoying
the
country
and
he
knew
all
the
time
that
i
was
with
the
mcbrides
for
julia
told
him
so
you
men
ought
to
leave
intrigue
to
women
you
have
a
light
enough
touch
julia
has
a
trunkful
of
the
most
ravishing
new
clothes
an
evening
gown
of
rainbow
liberty
crepe
that
would
be
fitting
raiment
for
the
angels
in
paradise
and
i
thought
that
my
own
clothes
this
year
were
unprecedentedly
is
there
such
a
word
beautiful
i
copied
paterson
wardrobe
with
the
aid
of
a
cheap
dressmaker
and
though
the
gowns
did
turn
out
quite
twins
of
the
originals
i
was
entirely
happy
until
julia
unpacked
but
now
i
live
to
see
paris
dear
daddy
are
you
glad
you
not
a
girl
i
suppose
you
think
that
the
fuss
we
make
over
clothes
is
too
absolutely
silly
it
is
no
doubt
about
it
but
it
entirely
your
fault
did
you
ever
hear
about
the
learned
herr
professor
who
regarded
unnecessary
adornment
with
contempt
and
favoured
sensible
utilitarian
clothes
for
women
his
wife
who
was
an
obliging
creature
adopted

you

girl
yours
ever
judy
ps
the
in
our
corridor
wears
blue
checked
gingham
aprons
i
am
going
to
get
her
some
brown
ones
instead
and
sink
the
blue
ones
in
the
bottom
of
the
lake
i
have
a
reminiscent
chill
every
time
i
look
at
them
november
dear
such
a
blight
has
fallen
over
my
literary
career
i
do
know
whether
to
tell
you
or
not
but
i
would
like
some
sympathy
silent
sympathy
please
do
the
wound
by
referring
to
it
in
your
next
letter
i
been
writing
a
book
all
last
winter
in
the
evenings
and
all
the
summer
when
i
was
teaching
latin
to
my
two
stupid
children
i
just
finished
it
before
college
opened
and
sent
it
to
a
publisher
he
kept
it
two
months
and
i
was
certain
he
was
going
to
take
it
but
yesterday
morning
an
express
parcel
came
thirty
cents
due
and
there
it
was
back
again
with
a
letter
from
the
publisher
a
very
nice
fatherly
letter
but
frank
he
said
he
saw
from
the
address
that
i
was
still
at
college
and
if
i
would
accept
some
advice
he
would
suggest
that
i
put
all
of
my
energy
into
my
lessons
and
wait
until
i
graduated
before
beginning
to
write
he
enclosed
his
reader
opinion
here
it
is
highly
improbable
characterization
exaggerated
conversation
unnatural
a
good
deal
of
humour
but
not
always
in
the
best
of
taste
tell
her
to
keep
on
trying
and
in
time
she
may
produce
a
real
book
not
on
the
whole
flattering
is
it
daddy
and
i
thought
i
was
making
a
notable
addition
to
american
literature
i
did
truly
i
was
planning
to
surprise
you
by
writing
a
great
novel
before
i
graduated
i
collected
the
material
for
it
while
i
was
at
julia
last
christmas
but
i
dare
say
the
editor
is
right
probably
two
weeks
was
not
enough
in
which
to
observe
the
manners
and
customs
of
a
great
city
i
took
it
walking
with
me
yesterday
afternoon
and
when
i
came
to
the
gas
house
i
went
in
and
asked
the
engineer
if
i
might
borrow
his
furnace
he
politely
opened
the
door
and
with
my
own
hands
i
chucked
it
in
i
felt
as
though
i
had
cremated
my
only
child
i
went
to
bed
last
night
utterly
dejected
i
thought
i
was
never
going
to
amount
to
anything
and
that
you
had
thrown
away
your
money
for
nothing
but
what
do
you
think
i
woke
up
this
morning
with
a
beautiful
new
plot
in
my
head
and
i
been
going
about
all
day
planning
my
characters
just
as
happy
as
i
could
be
no
one
can
ever
accuse
me
of
being
a
pessimist
if
i
had
a
husband
and
twelve
children
swallowed
by
an
earthquake
one
day
i
bob
up
smilingly
the
next
morning
and
commence
to
look
for
another
set
affectionately
judy
december
dear
i
dreamed
the
funniest
dream
last
night
i
thought
i
went
into
a
book
store
and
the
clerk
brought
me
a
new
book
named
the
life
and
letters
of
judy
abbott
i
could
see
it
perfectly
plainly
red
cloth
binding
with
a
picture
of
the
john
grier
home
on
the
cover
and
my
portrait
for
a
frontispiece
with
truly
yours
judy
abbott
written
below
but
just
as
i
was
turning
to
the
end
to
read
the
inscription
on
my
tombstone
i
woke
up
it
was
very
annoying
i
almost
found
out
whom
i
going
to
marry
and
when
i
going
to
die
do
you
think
it
would
be
interesting
if
you
really
could
read
the
story
of
your
life
written
perfectly
truthfully
by
an
omniscient
author
and
suppose
you
could
only
read
it
on
this
condition
that
you
would
never
forget
it
but
would
have
to
go
through
life
knowing
ahead
of
time
exactly
how
everything
you
did
would
turn
out
and
foreseeing
to
the
exact
hour
the
time
when
you
would
die
how
many
people
do
you
suppose
would
have
the
courage
to
read
it
then
or
how
many
could
suppress
their
curiosity
sufficiently
to
escape
from
reading
it
even
at
the
price
of
having
to
live
without
hope
and
without
surprises
life
is
monotonous
enough
at
best
you
have
to
eat
and
sleep
about
so
often
but
imagine
how
deadly
monotonous
it
would
be
if
nothing
unexpected
could
happen
between
meals
mercy
daddy
there
a
blot
but
i
on
the
third
page
and
i
ca
begin
a
new
sheet
i
going
on
with
biology
again
this
year
very
interesting
subject
we
studying
the
alimentary
system
at
present
you
should
see
how
sweet
a
of
the
duodenum
of
a
cat
is
under
the
microscope
also
we
arrived
at
philosophy
interesting
but
evanescent
i
prefer
biology
where
you
can
pin
the
subject
under
discussion
to
a
board
there
another
and
another
this
pen
is
weeping
copiously
please
excuse
its
tears
do
you
believe
in
free
will
i
do
unreservedly
i
do
agree
at
all
with
the
philosophers
who
think
that
every
action
is
the
absolutely
inevitable
and
automatic
resultant
of
an
aggregation
of
remote
causes
that
the
most
immoral
doctrine
i
ever
heard
nobody
would
be
to
blame
for
anything
if
a
man
believed
in
fatalism
he
would
naturally
just
sit
down
and
say
lord
will
be
done
and
continue
to
sit
until
he
fell
over
dead
i
believe
absolutely
in
my
own
free
will
and
my
own
power
to
accomplish
and
that
is
the
belief
that
moves
mountains
you
watch
me
become
a
great
author
i
have
four
chapters
of
my
new
book
finished
and
five
more
drafted
this
is
a
very
abstruse
letter
does
your
head
ache
daddy
i
think
we
stop
now
and
make
some
fudge
i
sorry
i
ca
send
you
a
piece
it
will
be
unusually
good
for
we
going
to
make
it
with
real
cream
and
three
butter
balls
yours
affectionately
judy
ps
we
having
fancy
dancing
in
gymnasium
class
you
can
see
by
the
accompanying
picture
how
much
we
look
like
a
real
ballet
the
one
at
the
end
accomplishing
a
graceful
pirouette
is
me
i
mean
i
december
my
dear
dear
daddy
have
you
any
sense
do
you
know
that
you
must
give
one
girl
seventeen
christmas
presents
i
a
socialist
please
remember
do
you
wish
to
turn
me
into
a
plutocrat
think
how
embarrassing
it
would
be
if
we
should
ever
quarrel
i
should
have
to
engage
a
to
return
your
gifts
i
am
sorry
that
the
necktie
i
sent
was
so
wobbly
i
knit
it
with
my
own
hands
as
you
doubtless
discovered
from
internal
evidence
you
will
have
to
wear
it
on
cold
days
and
keep
your
coat
buttoned
up
tight
thank
you
daddy
a
thousand
times
i
think
you
the
sweetest
man
that
ever
lived
and
the
foolishest
judy
here
a
clover
from
camp
mcbride
to
bring
you
good
luck
for
the
new
year
january
do
you
wish
to
do
something
daddy
that
will
ensure
your
eternal
salvation
there
is
a
family
here
who
are
in
awfully
desperate
straits
a
mother
and
father
and
four
visible
children
the
two
older
boys
have
disappeared
into
the
world
to
make
their
fortune
and
have
not
sent
any
of
it
back
the
father
worked
in
a
glass
factory
and
got
consumption
it
awfully
unhealthy
work
and
now
has
been
sent
away
to
a
hospital
that
took
all
their
savings
and
the
support
of
the
family
falls
upon
the
oldest
daughter
who
is
she
dressmakes
for
a
day
when
she
can
get
it
and
embroiders
centrepieces
in
the
evening
the
mother
is
very
strong
and
is
extremely
ineffectual
and
pious
she
sits
with
her
hands
folded
a
picture
of
patient
resignation
while
the
daughter
kills
herself
with
overwork
and
responsibility
and
worry
she
does
see
how
they
are
going
to
get
through
the
rest
of
the
winter
and
i
do
either
one
hundred
dollars
would
buy
some
coal
and
some
shoes
for
three
children
so
that
they
could
go
to
school
and
give
a
little
margin
so
that
she
worry
herself
to
death
when
a
few
days
pass
and
she
does
get
work
you
are
the
richest
man
i
know
do
you
suppose
you
could
spare
one
hundred
dollars
that
girl
deserves
help
a
lot
more
than
i
ever
did
i
would
ask
it
except
for
the
girl
i
do
care
much
what
happens
to
the
mother
she
is
such
a
the
way
people
are
for
ever
rolling
their
eyes
to
heaven
and
saying
it
all
for
the
best
when
they
are
perfectly
dead
sure
not
makes
me
enraged
humility
or
resignation
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
is
simply
impotent
inertia
i
for
a
more
militant
religion
we
are
getting
the
most
dreadful
lessons
in
philosophy
all
of
schopenhauer
for
tomorrow
the
professor
does
seem
to
realize
that
we
are
taking
any
other
subject
he
a
queer
old
duck
he
goes
about
with
his
head
in
the
clouds
and
blinks
dazedly
when
occasionally
he
strikes
solid
earth
he
tries
to
lighten
his
lectures
with
an
occasional
witticism
and
we
do
our
best
to
smile
but
i
assure
you
his
jokes
are
no
laughing
matter
he
spends
his
entire
time
between
classes
in
trying
to
figure
out
whether
matter
really
exists
or
whether
he
only
thinks
it
exists
i
sure
my
sewing
girl
has
any
doubt
but
that
it
exists
where
do
you
think
my
new
novel
is
in
the
i
can
see
myself
that
it
no
good
on
earth
and
when
a
loving
author
realizes
that
what
would
be
the
judgment
of
a
critical
public
later
i
address
you
daddy
from
a
bed
of
pain
for
two
days
i
been
laid
up
with
swollen
tonsils
i
can
just
swallow
hot
milk
and
that
is
all
were
your
parents
thinking
of
not
to
have
those
tonsils
out
when
you
were
a
baby
the
doctor
wished
to
know
i
sure
i
have
an
idea
but
i
doubt
if
they
were
thinking
much
about
me
yours
j
a
next
morning
i
just
read
this
over
before
sealing
it
i
do
know
why
i
cast
such
a
misty
atmosphere
over
life
i
hasten
to
assure
you
that
i
am
young
and
happy
and
exuberant
and
i
trust
you
are
the
same
youth
has
nothing
to
do
with
birthdays
only
with
alivedness
of
spirit
so
even
if
your
hair
is
grey
daddy
you
can
still
be
a
boy
affectionately
judy
dear
philanthropist
your
cheque
for
my
family
came
yesterday
thank
you
so
much
i
cut
gymnasium
and
took
it
down
to
them
right
after
luncheon
and
you
should
have
seen
the
girl
face
she
was
so
surprised
and
happy
and
relieved
that
she
looked
almost
young
and
she
only
is
it
pitiful
anyway
she
feels
now
as
though
all
the
good
things
were
coming
together
she
has
steady
work
ahead
for
two
months
someone
getting
married
and
there
a
trousseau
to
make
the
good
lord
cried
the
mother
when
she
grasped
the
fact
that
that
small
piece
of
paper
was
one
hundred
dollars
was
the
good
lord
at
all
said
i
was
smith
i
called
you
it
was
the
good
lord
who
put
it
in
his
mind
said
she
at
all
i
put
it
in
his
mind
myself
said
i
but
anyway
daddy
i
trust
the
good
lord
will
reward
you
suitably
you
deserve
ten
thousand
years
out
of
purgatory
yours
most
gratefully
judy
abbott
may
it
please
your
most
excellent
majesty
this
morning
i
did
eat
my
breakfast
upon
a
cold
turkey
pie
and
a
goose
and
i
did
send
for
a
cup
of
tee
a
china
drink
of
which
i
had
never
drank
before
do
be
nervous
daddy
i
have
lost
my
mind
i
merely
quoting
pepys
we
reading
him
in
connection
with
english
history
original
sources
sallie
and
julia
and
i
converse
now
in
the
language
of
listen
to
this
went
to
charing
cross
to
see
major
harrison
hanged
drawn
and
quartered
he
looking
as
cheerful
as
any
man
could
do
in
that
condition
and
this
with
my
lady
who
is
in
handsome
mourning
for
her
brother
who
died
yesterday
of
spotted
fever
seems
a
little
early
to
commence
entertaining
does
it
a
friend
of
pepys
devised
a
very
cunning
manner
whereby
the
king
might
pay
his
debts
out
of
the
sale
to
poor
people
of
old
decayed
provisions
what
do
you
a
reformer
think
of
that
i
do
believe
we
so
bad
today
as
the
newspapers
make
out
samuel
was
as
excited
about
his
clothes
as
any
girl
he
spent
five
times
as
much
on
dress
as
his
wife
that
appears
to
have
been
the
golden
age
of
husbands
is
this
a
touching
entry
you
see
he
really
was
honest
came
home
my
fine
camlett
cloak
with
gold
buttons
which
cost
me
much
money
and
i
pray
god
to
make
me
able
to
pay
for
it
excuse
me
for
being
so
full
of
pepys
i
writing
a
special
topic
on
him
what
do
you
think
daddy
the
association
has
abolished
the
ten
rule
we
can
keep
our
lights
all
night
if
we
choose
the
only
requirement
being
that
we
do
not
disturb
others
we
are
not
supposed
to
entertain
on
a
large
scale
the
result
is
a
beautiful
commentary
on
human
nature
now
that
we
may
stay
up
as
long
as
we
choose
we
no
longer
choose
our
heads
begin
to
nod
at
nine
and
by
the
pen
drops
from
our
nerveless
grasp
it
now
good
night
sunday
just
back
from
church
preacher
from
georgia
we
must
take
care
he
says
not
to
develop
our
intellects
at
the
expense
of
our
emotional
natures
but
methought
it
was
a
poor
dry
sermon
pepys
again
it
does
matter
what
part
of
the
united
states
or
canada
they
come
from
or
what
denomination
they
are
we
always
get
the
same
sermon
why
on
earth
do
they
go
to
men
colleges
and
urge
the
students
not
to
allow
their
manly
natures
to
be
crushed
out
by
too
much
mental
application
it
a
beautiful
day
frozen
and
icy
and
clear
as
soon
as
dinner
is
over
sallie
and
julia
and
marty
keene
and
eleanor
pratt
friends
of
mine
but
you
do
know
them
and
i
are
going
to
put
on
short
skirts
and
walk
country
to
crystal
spring
farm
and
have
a
fried
chicken
and
waffle
supper
and
then
have
mr
crystal
spring
drive
us
home
in
his
buckboard
we
are
supposed
to
be
inside
the
campus
at
seven
but
we
are
going
to
stretch
a
point
tonight
and
make
it
eight
farewell
kind
sir
i
have
the
honour
of
subscribing
myself
your
most
loyall
dutifull
faithfull
and
obedient
servant
abbott
march
fifth
dear
mr
trustee
tomorrow
is
the
first
wednesday
in
the
month
a
weary
day
for
the
john
grier
home
how
relieved
they
be
when
five
comes
and
you
pat
them
on
the
head
and
take
yourselves
off
did
you
individually
ever
pat
me
on
the
head
daddy
i
do
believe
so
my
memory
seems
to
be
concerned
only
with
fat
trustees
give
the
home
my
love
please
my
truly
love
i
have
quite
a
feeling
of
tenderness
for
it
as
i
look
back
through
a
haze
of
four
years
when
i
first
came
to
college
i
felt
quite
resentful
because
i
been
robbed
of
the
normal
kind
of
childhood
that
the
other
girls
had
had
but
now
i
do
feel
that
way
in
the
least
i
regard
it
as
a
very
unusual
adventure
it
gives
me
a
sort
of
vantage
point
from
which
to
stand
aside
and
look
at
life
emerging
full
grown
i
get
a
perspective
on
the
world
that
other
people
who
have
been
brought
up
in
the
thick
of
things
entirely
lack
i
know
lots
of
girls
julia
for
instance
who
never
know
that
they
are
happy
they
are
so
accustomed
to
the
feeling
that
their
senses
are
deadened
to
it
but
as
for
me
i
am
perfectly
sure
every
moment
of
my
life
that
i
am
happy
and
i
going
to
keep
on
being
no
matter
what
unpleasant
things
turn
up
i
going
to
regard
them
even
toothaches
as
interesting
experiences
and
be
glad
to
know
what
they
feel
like
sky
above
me
i
a
heart
for
any
fate
however
daddy
do
take
this
new
affection
for
the
too
literally
if
i
have
five
children
like
rousseau
i
sha
leave
them
on
the
steps
of
a
foundling
asylum
in
order
to
insure
their
being
brought
up
simply
give
my
kindest
regards
to
lippett
that
i
think
is
truthful
love
would
be
a
little
strong
and
do
forget
to
tell
her
what
a
beautiful
nature
i
developed
affectionately
judy
lock
willow
april
dear
daddy
do
you
observe
the
postmark
sallie
and
i
are
embellishing
lock
willow
with
our
presence
during
the
easter
vacation
we
decided
that
the
best
thing
we
could
do
with
our
ten
days
was
to
come
where
it
is
quiet
our
nerves
had
got
to
the
point
where
they
would
stand
another
meal
in
fergussen
dining
in
a
room
with
four
hundred
girls
is
an
ordeal
when
you
are
tired
there
is
so
much
noise
that
you
ca
hear
the
girls
across
the
table
speak
unless
they
make
their
hands
into
a
megaphone
and
shout
that
is
the
truth
we
are
tramping
over
the
hills
and
reading
and
writing
and
having
a
nice
restful
time
we
climbed
to
the
top
of
hill
this
morning
where
master
jervie
and
i
once
cooked
supper
it
does
seem
possible
that
it
was
nearly
two
years
ago
i
could
still
see
the
place
where
the
smoke
of
our
fire
blackened
the
rock
it
is
funny
how
certain
places
get
connected
with
certain
people
and
you
never
go
back
without
thinking
of
them
i
was
quite
lonely
without
him
for
two
minutes
what
do
you
think
is
my
latest
activity
daddy
you
will
begin
to
believe
that
i
am
incorrigible
i
am
writing
a
book
i
started
it
three
weeks
ago
and
am
eating
it
up
in
chunks
i
caught
the
secret
master
jervie
and
that
editor
man
were
right
you
are
most
convincing
when
you
write
about
the
things
you
know
and
this
time
it
is
about
something
that
i
do
know
exhaustively
guess
where
it
laid
in
the
john
grier
home
and
it
good
daddy
i
actually
believe
it
is
just
about
the
tiny
little
things
that
happened
every
day
i
a
realist
now
i
abandoned
romanticism
i
shall
go
back
to
it
later
though
when
my
own
adventurous
future
begins
this
new
book
is
going
to
get
itself
finished
and
published
you
see
if
it
does
if
you
just
want
a
thing
hard
enough
and
keep
on
trying
you
do
get
it
in
the
end
i
been
trying
for
four
years
to
get
a
letter
from
you
and
i
have
given
up
hope
yet
goodbye
daddy
dear
i
like
to
call
you
daddy
dear
it
so
alliterative
affectionately
judy
ps
i
forgot
to
tell
you
the
farm
news
but
it
very
distressing
skip
this
postscript
if
you
do
want
your
sensibilities
all
wrought
up
poor
old
grove
is
dead
he
got
so
that
he
could
chew
and
they
had
to
shoot
him
nine
chickens
were
killed
by
a
weasel
or
a
skunk
or
a
rat
last
week
one
of
the
cows
is
sick
and
we
had
to
have
the
veterinary
surgeon
out
from
bonnyrigg
four
corners
amasai
stayed
up
all
night
to
give
her
linseed
oil
and
whisky
but
we
have
an
awful
suspicion
that
the
poor
sick
cow
got
nothing
but
linseed
oil
sentimental
tommy
the
cat
has
disappeared
we
are
afraid
he
has
been
caught
in
a
trap
there
are
lots
of
troubles
in
the
world
may
dear
this
is
going
to
be
extremely
short
because
my
shoulder
aches
at
the
sight
of
a
pen
lecture
notes
all
day
immortal
novel
all
evening
make
too
much
writing

weeks

wednesday

think
you
might
come
and
make
my
acquaintance

shall
hate
you
if
you

inviting
master
jervie
he
being
her
family
and
sallie
inviting
jimmie

being
her
family
but

do
want
her

june

educated
my
diploma

the
bottom
bureau
drawer
with
my
two
best
dresses
commencement
was
as

with
a
few
showers
at
vital
moments
thank
you
for
your
rosebuds
they
were
lovely
master
jervie
and
master
jimmie
both
gave
me
roses
too
but
i
left
theirs
in
the
bath
tub
and
carried
yours
in
the
class
procession
here
i
am
at
lock
willow
for
the
summer
for
ever
maybe
the
board
is
cheap
the
surroundings
quiet
and
conducive
to
a
literary
life
what
more
does
a
struggling
author
wish
i
am
mad
about
my
book
i
think
of
it
every
waking
moment
and
dream
of
it
at
night
all
i
want
is
peace
and
quiet
and
lots
of
time
to
work
interspersed
with
nourishing
meals
master
jervie
is
coming
up
for
a
week
or
so
in
august
and
jimmie
mcbride
is
going
to
drop
in
sometime
through
the
summer
connected
with
a
bond
house
now
and
goes
about
the
country
selling
bonds
to
banks
he
going
to
combine
the
national
at
the
corners
and
me
on
the
same
trip
you
see
that
lock
willow
is
entirely
lacking
in
society
i
be
expecting
to
have
you
come
motoring
through
only
i
know
now
that
that
is
hopeless
when
you
would
come
to
my
commencement
i
tore
you
from
my
heart
and
buried
you
for
ever
judy
abbott
july
dearest
is
it
fun
to
work
or
do
you
ever
do
it
it
especially
fun
when
your
kind
of
work
is
the
thing
you
rather
do
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
i
been
writing
as
fast
as
my
pen
would
go
every
day
this
summer
and
my
only
quarrel
with
life
is
that
the
days
long
enough
to
write
all
the
beautiful
and
valuable
and
entertaining
thoughts
i
thinking
i
finished
the
second
draft
of
my
book
and
am
going
to
begin
the
third
tomorrow
morning
at
seven
it
the
sweetest
book
you
ever
saw
it
is
truly
i
think
of
nothing
else
i
can
barely
wait
in
the
morning
to
dress
and
eat
before
beginning
then
i
write
and
write
and
write
till
suddenly
i
so
tired
that
i
limp
all
over
then
i
go
out
with
colin
the
new
sheep
dog
and
romp
through
the
fields
and
get
a
fresh
supply
of
ideas
for
the
next
day
it
the
most
beautiful
book
you
ever
saw
oh
pardon
i
said
that
before
you
do
think
me
conceited
do
you
daddy
dear
i
not
really
only
just
now
i
in
the
enthusiastic
stage
maybe
later
on
i
get
cold
and
critical
and
sniffy
no
i
sure
i
wo
this
time
i
written
a
real
book
just
wait
till
you
see
it
i
try
for
a
minute
to
talk
about
something
else
i
never
told
you
did
i
that
amasai
and
carrie
got
married
last
may
they
are
still
working
here
but
so
far
as
i
can
see
it
has
spoiled
them
both
she
used
to
laugh
when
he
tramped
in
mud
or
dropped
ashes
on
the
floor
but
now
you
should
hear
her
scold
and
she
does
curl
her
hair
any
longer
amasai
who
used
to
be
so
obliging
about
beating
rugs
and
carrying
wood
grumbles
if
you
suggest
such
a
thing
also
his
neckties
are
quite
dingy
black
and
brown
where
they
used
to
be
scarlet
and
purple
i
determined
never
to
marry
it
a
deteriorating
process
evidently
there
is
much
of
any
farm
news
the
animals
are
all
in
the
best
of
health
the
pigs
are
unusually
fat
the
cows
seem
contented
and
the
hens
are
laying
well
are
you
interested
in
poultry
if
so
let
me
recommend
that
invaluable
little
work
eggs
per
hen
per
year
i
am
thinking
of
starting
an
incubator
next
spring
and
raising
broilers
you
see
i
settled
at
lock
willow
permanently
i
have
decided
to
stay
until
i
written
novels
like
anthony
trollope
mother
then
i
shall
have
completed
my
life
work
and
can
retire
and
travel
james
mcbride
spent
last
sunday
with
us
fried
chicken
and
for
dinner
both
of
which
he
appeared
to
appreciate
i
was
awfully
glad
to
see
him
he
brought
a
momentary
reminder
that
the
world
at
large
exists
poor
jimmie
is
having
a
hard
time
peddling
his
bonds
the
national
at
the
corners
would
have
anything
to
do
with
them
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
pay
six
per
cent
interest
and
sometimes
seven
i
think
he
end
up
by
going
home
to
worcester
and
taking
a
job
in
his
father
factory
he
too
open
and
confiding
and
ever
to
make
a
successful
financier
but
to
be
the
manager
of
a
flourishing
overall
factory
is
a
very
desirable
position
do
you
think
just
now
he
turns
up
his
nose
at
overalls
but
come
to
them
i
hope
you
appreciate
the
fact
that
this
is
a
long
letter
from
a
person
with
writer
cramp
but
i
still
love
you
daddy
dear
and
i
very
happy
with
beautiful
scenery
all
about
and
lots
to
eat
and
a
comfortable
bed
and
a
ream
of
blank
paper
and
a
pint
of
ink
what
more
does
one
want
in
the
world
yours
as
always
judy
ps
the
postman
arrives
with
some
more
news
we
are
to
expect
master
jervie
on
friday
next
to
spend
a
week
that
a
very
pleasant
prospect
only
i
am
afraid
my
poor
book
will
suffer
master
jervie
is
very
demanding
august
dear
where
are
you
i
wonder
i
never
know
what
part
of
the
world
you
are
in
but
i
hope
you
not
in
new
york
during
this
awful
weather
i
hope
you
on
a
mountain
peak
but
not
in
switzerland
somewhere
nearer
looking
at
the
snow
and
thinking
about
me
please
be
thinking
about
me
i
quite
lonely
and
i
want
to
be
thought
about
oh
daddy
i
wish
i
knew
you
then
when
we
were
unhappy
we
could
cheer
each
other
up
i
do
think
i
can
stand
much
more
of
lock
willow
i
thinking
of
moving
sallie
is
going
to
do
settlement
work
in
boston
next
winter
do
you
think
it
would
be
nice
for
me
to
go
with
her
then
we
could
have
a
studio
together
i
would
write
while
she
settled
and
we
could
be
together
in
the
evenings
evenings
are
very
long
when
there
no
one
but
the
semples
and
carrie
and
amasai
to
talk
to
i
know
in
advance
that
you
wo
like
my
studio
idea
i
can
read
your
secretary
letter
now
jerusha
abbott
madam
smith
prefers
that
you
remain
at
lock
willow
truly
h
griggs
i
hate
your
secretary
i
am
certain
that
a
man
named
elmer
griggs
must
be
horrid
but
truly
daddy
i
think
i
shall
have
to
go
to
boston
i
ca
stay
here
if
something
does
happen
soon
i
shall
throw
myself
into
the
silo
pit
out
of
sheer
desperation
mercy
but
it
hot
all
the
grass
is
burnt
up
and
the
brooks
are
dry
and
the
roads
are
dusty
it
has
rained
for
weeks
and
weeks
this
letter
sounds
as
though
i
had
hydrophobia
but
i
have
i
just
want
some
family
goodbye
my
dearest
daddy
i
wish
i
knew
you
judy
lock
willow
september
dear
daddy
something
has
happened
and
i
need
advice
i
need
it
from
you
and
from
nobody
else
in
the
world
would
it
be
possible
for
me
to
see
you
it
so
much
easier
to
talk
than
to
write
and
i
afraid
your
secretary
might
open
the
letter
judy
ps
i
very
unhappy
lock
willow
october
dear
your
note
written
in
your
own
hand
and
a
pretty
wobbly
hand
came
this
morning
i
am
so
sorry
that
you
have
been
ill
i
would
have
bothered
you
with
my
affairs
if
i
had
known
yes
i
will
tell
you
the
trouble
but
it
sort
of
complicated
to
write
and
very
private
please
do
keep
this
letter
but
burn
it
before
i
begin
here
a
cheque
for
one
thousand
dollars
it
seems
funny
does
it
for
me
to
be
sending
a
cheque
to
you
where
do
you
think
i
got
it
i
sold
my
story
daddy
it
going
to
be
published
serially
in
seven
parts
and
then
in
a
book
you
might
think
i
be
wild
with
joy
but
i
not
i
entirely
apathetic
of
course
i
glad
to
begin
paying
you
i
owe
you
over
two
thousand
more
it
coming
in
instalments
now
do
be
horrid
please
about
taking
it
because
it
makes
me
happy
to
return
it
i
owe
you
a
great
deal
more
than
the
mere
money
and
the
rest
i
will
continue
to
pay
all
my
life
in
gratitude
and
affection
and
now
daddy
about
the
other
thing
please
give
me
your
most
worldly
advice
whether
you
think
i
like
it
or
not
you
know
that
i
always
had
a
very
special
feeling
towards
you
you
sort
of
represented
my
whole
family
but
you
wo
mind
will
you
if
i
tell
you
that
i
have
a
very
much
more
special
feeling
for
another
man
you
can
probably
guess
without
much
trouble
who
he
is
i
suspect
that
my
letters
have
been
very
full
of
master
jervie
for
a
very
long
time
i
wish
i
could
make
you
understand
what
he
is
like
and
how
entirely
companionable
we
are
we
think
the
same
about
everything
i
am
afraid
i
have
a
tendency
to
make
over
my
ideas
to
match
his
but
he
is
almost
always
right
he
ought
to
be
you
know
for
he
has
fourteen
start
of
me
in
other
ways
though
he
just
an
overgrown
boy
and
he
does
need
looking
after
he
has
any
sense
about
wearing
rubbers
when
it
rains
he
and
i
always
think
the
same
things
are
funny
and
that
is
such
a
lot
it
dreadful
when
two
people
senses
of
humour
are
antagonistic
i
do
believe
there
any
bridging
that
gulf
and
he
is
oh
well
he
is
just
himself
and
i
miss
him
and
miss
him
and
miss
him
the
whole
world
seems
empty
and
aching
i
hate
the
moonlight
because
it
beautiful
and
he
is
here
to
see
it
with
me
but
maybe
you
loved
somebody
too
and
you
know
if
you
have
i
do
need
to
explain
if
you
have
i
ca
explain
anyway
that
the
way
i
feel
and
i
refused
to
marry
him
i
did
tell
him
why
i
was
just
dumb
and
miserable
i
could
think
of
anything
to
say
and
now
he
has
gone
away
imagining
that
i
want
to
marry
jimmie
mcbride
i
do
in
the
least
i
would
think
of
marrying
jimmie
he
is
grown
up
enough
but
master
jervie
and
i
got
into
a
dreadful
muddle
of
misunderstanding
and
we
both
hurt
each
other
feelings
the
reason
i
sent
him
away
was
not
because
i
care
for
him
but
because
i
cared
for
him
so
much
i
was
afraid
he
would
regret
it
in
the
future
and
i
could
stand
that
it
seem
right
for
a
person
of
my
lack
of
antecedents
to
marry
into
any
such
family
as
his
i
never
told
him
about
the
orphan
asylum
and
i
hated
to
explain
that
i
did
know
who
i
was
i
may
be
dreadful
you
know
and
his
family
are
proud
and
i
proud
too
also
i
felt
sort
of
bound
to
you
after
having
been
educated
to
be
a
writer
i
must
at
least
try
to
be
one
it
would
scarcely
be
fair
to
accept
your
education
and
then
go
off
and
not
use
it
but
now
that
i
am
going
to
be
able
to
pay
back
the
money
i
feel
that
i
have
partially
discharged
that
debt
besides
i
suppose
i
could
keep
on
being
a
writer
even
if
i
did
marry
the
two
professions
are
not
necessarily
exclusive
i
been
thinking
very
hard
about
it
of
course
he
is
a
socialist
and
he
has
unconventional
ideas
maybe
he
would
mind
marrying
into
the
proletariat
so
much
as
some
men
might
perhaps
when
two
people
are
exactly
in
accord
and
always
happy
when
together
and
lonely
when
apart
they
ought
not
to
let
anything
in
the
world
stand
between
them
of
course
i
want
to
believe
that
but
i
like
to
get
your
unemotional
opinion
you
probably
belong
to
a
family
also
and
will
look
at
it
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
and
not
just
a
sympathetic
human
point
of
view
so
you
see
how
brave
i
am
to
lay
it
before
you
suppose
i
go
to
him
and
explain
that
the
trouble
is
jimmie
but
is
the
john
grier
home
would
that
be
a
dreadful
thing
for
me
to
do
it
would
take
a
great
deal
of
courage
i
almost
rather
be
miserable
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
happened
nearly
two
months
ago
i
have
heard
a
word
from
him
since
he
was
here
i
was
just
getting
sort
of
acclimated
to
the
feeling
of
a
broken
heart
when
a
letter
came
from
julia
that
stirred
me
all
up
again
she
said
very
casually
that
jervis
had
been
caught
out
all
night
in
a
storm
when
he
was
hunting
in
canada
and
had
been
ill
ever
since
with
pneumonia
and
i
never
knew
it
i
was
feeling
hurt
because
he
had
just
disappeared
into
blankness
without
a
word
i
think
he
pretty
unhappy
and
i
know
i
am
what
seems
to
you
the
right
thing
for
me
to
do
judy
october
dearest
yes
certainly
i
come
at
four
next
wednesday
afternoon
of
course
i
can
find
the
way
i
been
in
new
york
three
times
and
am
not
quite
a
baby
i
ca
believe
that
i
am
really
going
to
see
you
i
been
just
thinking
you
so
long
that
it
hardly
seems
as
though
you
are
a
tangible
person
you
are
awfully
good
daddy
to
bother
yourself
with
me
when
not
strong
take
care
and
do
catch
cold
these
fall
rains
are
very
damp
affectionately
judy
ps
i
just
had
an
awful
thought
have
you
a
butler
i
afraid
of
butlers
and
if
one
opens
the
door
i
shall
faint
upon
the
step
what
can
i
say
to
him
you
did
tell
me
your
name
shall
i
ask
for
smith
thursday
morning
my
very
dearest
did
you
sleep
last
night
i
did
not
a
single
wink
i
was
too
amazed
and
excited
and
bewildered
and
happy
i
do
believe
i
ever
shall
sleep
again
or
eat
either
but
i
hope
you
slept
you
must
you
know
because
then
you
will
get
well
faster
and
can
come
to
me
dear
man
i
ca
bear
to
think
how
ill
you
been
and
all
the
time
i
never
knew
it
when
the
doctor
came
down
yesterday
to
put
me
in
the
cab
he
told
me
that
for
three
days
they
gave
you
up
oh
dearest
if
that
had
happened
the
light
would
have
gone
out
of
the
world
for
me
i
suppose
that
some
day
in
the
far
future
one
of
us
must
leave
the
other
but
at
least
we
shall
have
had
our
happiness
and
there
will
be
memories
to
live
with
i
meant
to
cheer
you
up
and
instead
i
have
to
cheer
myself
for
in
spite
of
being
happier
than
i
ever
dreamed
i
could
be
i
also
soberer
the
fear
that
something
may
happen
rests
like
a
shadow
on
my
heart
always
before
i
could
be
frivolous
and
and
unconcerned
because
i
had
nothing
precious
to
lose
but
now
i
shall
have
a
great
big
worry
all
the
rest
of
my
life
whenever
you
are
away
from
me
i
shall
be
thinking
of
all
the
automobiles
that
can
run
over
you
or
the
that
can
fall
on
your
head
or
the
dreadful
squirmy
germs
that
you
may
be
swallowing
my
peace
of
mind
is
gone
for
ever
but
anyway
i
never
cared
much
for
just
plain
peace
please
get
well
fast
fast
fast
i
want
to
have
you
close
by
where
i
can
touch
you
and
make
sure
you
are
tangible
such
a
little
half
hour
we
had
together
i
afraid
maybe
i
dreamed
it
if
i
were
only
a
member
of
your
family
a
very
distant
fourth
cousin
then
i
could
come
and
visit
you
every
day
and
read
aloud
and
plump
up
your
pillow
and
smooth
out
those
two
little
wrinkles
in
your
forehead
and
make
the
corners
of
your
mouth
turn
up
in
a
nice
cheerful
smile
but
you
are
cheerful
again
are
you
you
were
yesterday
before
i
left
the
doctor
said
i
must
be
a
good
nurse
that
you
looked
ten
years
younger
i
hope
that
being
in
love
does
make
every
one
ten
years
younger
will
you
still
care
for
me
darling
if
i
turn
out
to
be
only
eleven
yesterday
was
the
most
wonderful
day
that
could
ever
happen
if
i
live
to
be
i
shall
never
forget
the
tiniest
detail
the
girl
that
left
lock
willow
at
dawn
was
a
very
different
person
from
the
one
who
came
back
at
night
semple
called
me
at
four
i
started
wide
awake
in
the
darkness
and
the
first
thought
that
popped
into
my
head
was
am
going
to
see
i
ate
breakfast
in
the
kitchen
by
and
then
drove
the
five
miles
to
the
station
through
the
most
glorious
october
colouring
the
sun
came
up
on
the
way
and
the
swamp
maples
and
dogwood
glowed
crimson
and
orange
and
the
stone
walls
and
cornfields
sparkled
with
hoar
frost
the
air
was
keen
and
clear
and
full
of
promise
i
knew
something
was
going
to
happen
all
the
way
in
the
train
the
rails
kept
singing
going
to
see
it
made
me
feel
secure
i
had
such
faith
in
daddy
ability
to
set
things
right
and
i
knew
that
somewhere
another
man
dearer
than
daddy
was
wanting
to
see
me
and
somehow
i
had
a
feeling
that
before
the
journey
ended
i
should
meet
him
too
and
you
see
when
i
came
to
the
house
on
madison
avenue
it
looked
so
big
and
brown
and
forbidding
that
i
did
dare
go
in
so
i
walked
around
the
block
to
get
up
my
courage
but
i
need
have
been
a
bit
afraid
your
butler
is
such
a
nice
fatherly
old
man
that
he
made
me
feel
at
home
at
once
this
miss
abbott
he
said
to
me
and
i
said
so
i
did
have
to
ask
for
smith
after
all
he
told
me
to
wait
in
the
it
was
a
very
sombre
magnificent
man
sort
of
room
i
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
big
upholstered
chair
and
kept
saying
to
myself
going
to
see
i
going
to
see
then
presently
the
man
came
back
and
asked
me
please
to
step
up
to
the
library
i
was
so
excited
that
really
and
truly
my
feet
would
hardly
take
me
up
outside
the
door
he
turned
and
whispered
been
very
ill
miss
this
is
the
first
day
he
been
allowed
to
sit
up
not
stay
long
enough
to
excite
him
i
knew
from
the
way
he
said
it
that
he
loved
you
and
i
think
he
an
old
dear
then
he
knocked
and
said
abbott
and
i
went
in
and
the
door
closed
behind
me
it
was
so
dim
coming
in
from
the
brightly
lighted
hall
that
for
a
moment
i
could
scarcely
make
out
anything
then
i
saw
a
big
easy
chair
before
the
fire
and
a
shining
tea
table
with
a
smaller
chair
beside
it
and
i
realized
that
a
man
was
sitting
in
the
big
chair
propped
up
by
pillows
with
a
rug
over
his
knees
before
i
could
stop
him
he
rose
rather
shakily
and
steadied
himself
by
the
back
of
the
chair
and
just
looked
at
me
without
a
word
and
then
and
then
i
saw
it
was
you
but
even
with
that
i
did
understand
i
thought
daddy
had
had
you
come
there
to
meet
me
or
a
surprise
then
you
laughed
and
held
out
your
hand
and
said
little
judy
could
you
guess
that
i
was
in
an
instant
it
flashed
over
me
oh
but
i
have
been
stupid
a
hundred
little
things
might
have
told
me
if
i
had
had
any
wits
i
would
make
a
very
good
detective
would
i
daddy
jervie
what
must
i
call
you
just
plain
jervie
sounds
disrespectful
and
i
be
disrespectful
to
you
it
was
a
very
sweet
half
hour
before
your
doctor
came
and
sent
me
away
i
was
so
dazed
when
i
got
to
the
station
that
i
almost
took
a
train
for
st
louis
and
you
were
pretty
dazed
too
you
forgot
to
give
me
any
tea
but
we
both
very
very
happy
are
we
i
drove
back
to
lock
willow
in
the
dark
but
oh
how
the
stars
were
shining
and
this
morning
i
been
out
with
colin
visiting
all
the
places
that
you
and
i
went
to
together
and
remembering
what
you
said
and
how
you
looked
the
woods
today
are
burnished
bronze
and
the
air
is
full
of
frost
it
climbing
weather
i
wish
you
were
here
to
climb
the
hills
with
me
i
am
missing
you
dreadfully
jervie
dear
but
it
a
happy
kind
of
missing
we
be
together
soon
we
belong
to
each
other
now
really
and
truly
no
does
it
seem
queer
for
me
to
belong
to
someone
at
last
it
seems
very
very
sweet
and
i
shall
never
let
you
be
sorry
for
a
single
instant
yours
for
ever
and
ever
judy
ps
this
is
the
first
i
ever
wrote

it
funny
