it
is
only
the
path
of
pure
simplicity
which
guards
and
preserves
the
spirit
to
hazleton
mirkil
dorothy
and
joseph
i
very
late
indeed
in
may
but
early
in
the
morning
laurel
ammidon
lay
in
bed
considering
two
widely
different
aspects
of
chairs
the
day
before
she
had
been
eleven
and
the
comparative
maturity
of
that
age
had
filled
her
with
a
moving
disdain
for
certain
fanciful
thoughts
which
had
given
her
extreme
youth
a
decidedly
novel
if
not
an
actually
adventurous
setting
until
yesterday
almost
she
had
regarded
the
various
chairs
of
the
house
as
beings
endowed
with
life
and
character
she
had
held
conversations
with
some
and
with
a
careless
exterior
not
warranted
by
an
inner
dread
avoided
others
in
gloomy
dusks
all
this
now
she
contemptuously
discarded
chairs
were
chairs
things
to
sit
on
wood
and
stuffed
cushions
yet
she
was
slightly
melancholy
at
losing
such
a
satisfactory
lot
of
reliable
familiars
unlike
older
people
victims
of
the
most
disconcerting
moods
and
mysterious
changes
chairs
could
always
be
counted
on
to
remain
secure
in
their
individual
peculiarities
she
could
see
by
her
fireplace
the
elaborately
carved
teakwood
chair
that
her
grandfather
had
brought
home
from
china
which
had
never
varied
from
the
state
of
a
brown
and
rather
benevolent
dragon
its
claws
were
always
claws
the
grinning
fretted
mouth
was
perpetually
fixed
for
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
a
mild
rumble
of
complaint
the
severe
waxed
hickory
beyond
with
the
broad
arm
for
writing
a
source
of
special
pride
had
been
an
accommodating
and
precise
old
gentleman
the
spindling
gold
chairs
in
the
drawingroom
were
supercilious
creatures
at
a
king
ball
the
graceful
impressive
formality
of
the
heppelwhites
in
the
dining
room
belonged
to
the
loveliest
of
boston
ladies
those
with
difficult
haircloth
seats
in
the
parlor
were
deacons
others
in
the
breakfast
room
talkative
and
unpretentious
while
the
deep
before
the
library
fire
was
a
ship
there
were
mahogany
stools
dwarfs
of
dark
tricks
angry
things
in
the
hall
below
and
a
terrifying
shape
of
gleaming
red
that
without
question
stirred
hatefully
and
reached
out
curved
and
dripping
hands
anyhow
such
they
had
all
seemed
but
lately
she
had
felt
a
growing
secrecy
about
it
an
increasing
dread
of
being
laughed
at
and
now
definitely
eleven
she
recognized
the
necessity
of
dropping
such
pretense
even
with
herself
they
were
just
chairs
she
rerepeated
there
was
an
end
of
that
the
tall
clock
with
the
brass
face
outside
her
door
after
a
premonitory
whirring
loudly
and
firmly
struck
seven
and
laurel
wondered
whether
her
sisters
in
the
room
open
from
hers
were
awake
she
listened
attentively
but
there
was
no
sound
of
movement
she
made
a
noise
in
her
throat
that
might
at
once
have
appeared
accidental
and
been
successful
in
its
purpose
of
arousing
them
but
there
was
no
response
she
would
have
gone
in
and
frankly
waked
janet
who
was
not
yet
thirteen
and
reasonable
but
experience
had
shown
her
that
camilla
reposing
in
the
eminence
and
security
of
two
years
more
would
permit
no
such
light
freedom
with
her
slumbers
sidsall
who
had
been
given
a
big
room
for
herself
on
the
other
side
of
their
parents
would
greet
anyone
cheerfully
no
matter
how
tightly
she
might
have
been
asleep
and
sidsall
the
oldest
of
them
all
was
nearly
sixteen
and
had
stayed
for
part
of
their
cousin
lucy
saltonstone
dance
where
no
less
a
person
than
roger
brevard
had
asked
her
for
a
quadrille
laurel
thoughts
grew
so
active
that
she
was
unable
to
remain
any
longer
in
bed
she
freed
herself
from
the
enveloping
linen
and
crossed
the
room
to
a
window
through
which
the
sun
was
pouring
in
a
sharp
bright
angle
she
had
never
known
the
world
to
smell
so
delightful
it
was
one
of
the
notable
mays
in
which
the
lilacs
blossomed
and
she
stood
responding
with
a
sparkling
life
to
the
brilliant
scented
morning
the
perfume
of
the
lilacs
mingled
with
the
faintly
pungent
odor
of
box
wet
with
dew
she
could
see
looking
back
across
a
smooth
green
corner
of
the
lawn
next
door
the
enclosure
of
their
own
back
yard
divided
from
the
garden
by
a
white
lattice
fence
and
row
of
prim
grayish
poplars
at
the
farther
wall
her
grandfather
in
a
wide
palm
leaf
hat
was
stirring
about
his
pear
trees
tapping
the
ground
and
poking
among
the
branches
with
his
ivory
headed
cane
laurel
exuberantly
performed
her
morning
toilet
half
careless
in
her
soaring
spirits
of
the
possible
effect
of
numerous
small
ringings
of
pitcher
on
basin
the
clatter
of
drawers
upon
camilla
yesterday
she
had
worn
a
dress
of
light
wool
delaine
but
this
morning
she
decided
largely
summer
had
practically
come
and
on
her
own
authority
she
got
an
affair
of
thin
pineapple
cloth
out
of
the
yellow
camphorwood
chest
she
hurriedly
finished
weaving
her
heavy
chestnut
hair
into
two
gleaming
plaits
fastened
a
muslin
guimpe
at
the
back
and
slipped
into
her
dress
here
however
she
twisted
her
face
into
an
expression
of
annoyance
her
years
were
affronted
by
the
length
of
pantalets
that
hung
below
her
skirt
such
a
show
of
their
narrow
ruffles
might
do
for
a
very
small
girl
but
not
for
one
of
eleven
and
she
caught
them
up
until
only
the
merest
fulled
edge
was
visible
then
she
made
a
buoyant
descent
to
the
lower
hall
left
the
house
by
a
side
door
to
the
bricked
walk
and
an
arched
gate
into
the
yard
and
joined
her
grandfather
six
bells
in
the
morning
watch
he
announced
consulting
a
thick
gold
timepiece
head
pump
rigged
and
deck
swabbed
down
secure
in
her
knowledge
of
the
correct
answers
for
these
sudden
interrogations
laurel
impatiently
replied
yes
sir
scuttle
butt
filled
yes
sir
she
frowned
and
dug
a
heel
in
the
soft
ground
then
splice
the
keel
and
heave
the
galley
overboard
this
last
she
recognized
as
a
sally
of
humor
and
contrived
a
fleeting
perfunctory
smile
her
grandfather
turned
once
more
to
the
pears
see
the
buds
on
those
ashton
towns
he
commented
laurel
gazed
critically
the
varnished
red
buds
were
bursting
with
white
blossom
the
new
leaves
unrolling
tender
green
and
sticky
but
the
jargonelles
he
drew
in
his
lips
doubtfully
she
studied
him
with
the
profound
interest
his
sheer
being
always
invoked
she
was
absorbed
in
his
surprising
large
roundness
of
body
like
an
enormous
pudding
in
the
deliberate
care
with
which
he
moved
and
planted
his
feet
but
most
of
all
by
the
fact
that
when
he
was
angry
his
face
got
quite
purple
the
color
of
her
mother
paletot
or
a
hamburg
grape
they
crossed
the
yard
to
where
the
vines
of
the
latter
and
of
white
chasselas
laurel
was
familiar
with
these
names
from
frequent
horticultural
questionings
had
been
laid
down
in
cold
frames
for
later
transplanting
and
from
them
the
old
man
her
palm
tightly
held
in
his
trod
ponderously
to
the
currant
bushes
massed
against
the
closed
arcade
of
the
stables
the
wood
and
coal
and
store
houses
across
the
rear
of
the
place
at
last
with
frequent
disconcerting
mutterings
and
explosive
breaths
he
finished
his
inspection
and
turned
toward
the
house
laurel
conscious
of
her
own
superiority
of
apparel
surveyed
her
companion
in
a
frowning
attitude
exactly
caught
from
her
mother
he
had
on
that
mussy
suit
of
yellow
chinese
silk
and
there
was
a
spot
on
the
waistcoat
straining
at
its
pearl
buttons
she
wondered
maintaining
the
silent
mimicry
of
elder
remonstrance
why
he
would
wear
those
untidy
old
things
when
his
chests
were
heaped
with
snowy
white
linen
and
english
broadcloths
it
was
very
improper
in
an
ammidon
particularly
in
one
who
had
been
captain
of
so
many
big
ships
and
in
court
dress
with
a
cocked
hat
met
the
emperor
of
russia
they
did
not
retrace
laurel
steps
but
passed
through
a
narrow
wicket
to
the
garden
that
lay
directly
behind
the
house
the
enclosure
was
full
of
and
pouring
sunlight
the
lilac
trees
on
either
side
of
the
against
the
gallery
of
the
stable
were
blurred
with
their
new
lavender
flowering
the
thorned
glossy
foliage
of
the
hedge
of
june
roses
on
briggs
street
glittered
with
diamonds
of
water
and
the
rockery
in
the
far
corner
showed
a
quiver
of
arbutus
among
its
strange
and
lacy
ferns
and
mosses
laurel
sniffed
the
fragrant
air
filled
with
a
tumult
of
energy
every
instinct
longed
to
skip
she
thought
of
jouncing
as
high
as
the
poplars
right
over
the
house
and
into
washington
square
beyond
miss
fidget
her
grandfather
exclaimed
exasperated
releasing
her
hand
you
like
holding
on
to
a
stormy
petrel
i
do
think
that
very
nice
she
replied
god
bless
me
he
said
turning
upon
her
his
steady
blue
gaze
what
have
we
got
here
all
dressed
up
to
go
ashore
she
sharply
elevated
a
shoulder
and
retorted
well
i
eleven
his
look
which
had
seemed
quite
fierce
grew
kindly
again
eleven
he
echoed
with
a
satisfactory
amazement
that
will
need
some
cumshaws
and
kisses
the
first
she
knew
was
a
word
of
pleasant
import
brought
from
the
east
and
meant
gifts
and
realizing
that
the
second
was
unavoidably
connected
with
it
she
philosophically
held
up
her
face
lifting
her
over
his
expanse
of
stomach
he
kissed
her
loudly
she
did
object
really
or
rather
she
would
at
all
but
for
a
strong
odor
of
manilla
cheroots
and
the
medford
rum
he
took
at
stated
periods
after
this
they
moved
on
through
the
bay
window
of
the
that
opened
on
the
garden
where
a
woman
was
brushing
with
a
nodding
feather
duster
under
the
white
arch
that
framed
the
main
stairway
and
turned
aside
to
where
breakfast
was
being
laid
laurel
saw
that
her
father
was
already
seated
at
the
table
intent
upon
the
tall
thickly
printed
sheet
of
the
salem
he
paused
to
meet
her
dutiful
lips
then
with
a
good
morning
father
returned
to
his
reading
camilla
entered
at
laurel
heels
and
the
latter
in
a
delight
slightly
tempered
by
doubt
saw
that
she
had
been
before
her
sister
in
a
suitable
dress
for
such
a
warm
day
camilla
still
wore
her
dark
merino
and
she
gazed
with
mingled
surprise
and
annoyance
at
laurel
airy
garb
did
mother
say
you
might
put
that
on
she
demanded
because
if
she
did
i
expect
you
will
have
to
go
right
up
from
breakfast
and
change
it
is
a
dress
at
all
for
so
early
in
the
morning
why
i
believe
one
of
your
very
best
the
look
of
critical
disapproval
suddenly
became
doubly
accusing
laurel
ammidon
wherever
are
your
pantalets
i
too
big
to
have
pantalets
hanging
down
over
my
shoetops
she
replied
defiantly
and
so
i
just
hitched
them
up
you
can
still
see
the
frill
janet
had
come
into
the
room
and
stood
behind
her
do
you
notice
camilla
she
advised
she
not
really
grown
up
they
turned
at
the
appearance
of
their
mother
dear
me
camilla
the
latter
observed
you
are
getting
too
particular
for
any
comfort
what
has
upset
you
now
look
at
laurel
camilla
replied
that
all
you
need
to
do
think
she
went
to
dances
instead
of
sidsall
laurel
painfully
avoided
her
mother
comprehensive
glance
very
beautiful
the
elder
said
in
a
tone
of
palpable
pleasure
laurel
advanced
her
lower
lip
ever
so
slightly
in
the
direction
of
camilla
but
you
have
taken
a
great
deal
into
your
own
hands
she
shifted
apparently
to
another
topic
there
will
be
no
lessons
for
i
have
to
send
miss
gomes
into
boston
at
this
announcement
laurel
was
flooded
with
a
joy
that
obviously
belonged
to
her
former
less
dignified
state
however
her
mother
continued
addressing
her
since
you
have
dressed
yourself
like
a
lady
i
shall
expect
you
to
behave
appropriately
no
soiled
or
torn
skirts
and
an
hour
at
your
piano
scales
instead
of
a
half
laurel
anticipation
of
pleasure
ebbed
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
she
would
have
to
move
with
the
greatest
caution
all
day
and
spend
a
whole
hour
at
the
piano
it
was
the
room
to
which
she
objected
rather
than
the
practicing
a
depressing
sort
of
place
where
she
was
careful
not
to
move
anything
out
of
the
stiff
and
threatening
order
in
which
it
belonged
the
chairdeacons
in
particular
were
severely
watchful
but
that
now
she
had
determined
to
ignore
she
turned
to
johnnycakes
honey
and
milk
only
half
hearing
in
her
preoccupation
with
the
injustice
that
had
overtaken
her
the
conversation
about
the
table
her
gaze
strayed
over
the
walls
of
the
breakfast
room
where
water
color
drawings
of
vessels
half
models
of
ships
on
teakwood
or
spanish
mahogany
boards
filled
every
possible
space
some
her
grandfather
had
sailed
in
as
second
and
then
first
mate
of
others
he
had
been
master
and
the
rest
she
knew
were
owned
by
ammidon
ammidon
and
saltonstone
her
grandfather
father
and
uncle
just
opposite
her
was
the
at
anchor
in
table
bay
the
sails
all
furled
except
the
which
hung
in
the
gear
a
gig
manned
by
six
sailors
in
tarpaulin
hats
with
an
officer
in
the
stern
sheets
swung
with
dripping
oars
across
the
dark
water
of
the
foreground
on
the
left
an
inky
ship
was
standing
in
close
hauled
on
the
port
tack
with
all
her
canvas
set
it
was
lighter
about
the
and
at
the
back
a
mountain
with
a
flat
top
showing
at
once
why
it
was
called
table
bay
rose
against
an
overcast
sky
laurel
knew
a
great
deal
about
the
for
instance
that
she
had
been
a
barque
of
two
hundred
and
nine
tons
because
it
had
been
her
grandfather
first
command
and
he
never
tired
of
narrating
every
detail
of
that
memorable
voyage
laurel
could
repeat
most
of
these
particulars
they
sailed
on
the
tenth
of
april
in
and
were
four
and
a
half
months
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
twenty
days
later
on
the
rocky
island
of
paul
grandfather
had
a
fight
with
a
monster
seal
a
sailor
took
the
scurvy
and
dosed
with
niter
and
vinegar
was
stowed
in
the
longboat
but
he
died
and
was
buried
at
sea
in
the
doldrums
then
with
a
cargo
of
sumatra
pepper
they
made
corregidor
island
and
manilla
bay
where
the
old
spanish
fort
stood
at
the
mouth
of
the
pasig
the
barque
the
final
cargo
of
hemp
and
indigo
and
sugar
in
the
hold
set
sail
again
for
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
returned
by
way
of
falmouth
in
england
and
rotterdam
home
the
other
drawings
were
hardly
less
familiar
ships
barques
brigs
and
topsail
schooners
the
skillful
work
of
salmon
anton
roux
and
chinnery
there
was
the
becalmed
off
marseilles
her
sails
hanging
idly
from
the
yards
and
stays
her
hull
with
painted
ports
and
carved
bow
and
stern
mirrored
in
the
level
sea
there
was
the
running
through
the
northeast
trades
with
royals
and
all
her
weather
studding
sails
set
farther
along
the
in
heavy
weather
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
being
driven
hard
across
the
agulhas
bank
under
topsails
reefed
courses
the
staysail
and
spanker
with
the
westerly
current
breaking
in
an
ugly
cross
sea
but
as
her
grandfather
always
explained
setting
the
ship
thirty
or
forty
miles
to
windward
in
a
day
she
lingered
finally
over
the
running
her
easting
down
far
to
the
southward
with
square
yards
under
a
maintop
sail
foresail
and
forestaysail
dead
before
a
gale
and
gigantic
long
seas
hurling
the
ship
on
in
the
bleak
watery
desolation
laurel
was
closely
concerned
in
all
these
one
cause
for
this
was
the
fact
that
her
grandfather
so
often
selected
her
as
the
audience
for
his
memories
and
stories
during
which
his
manner
was
completely
that
of
one
navigator
to
another
and
a
second
flourished
in
the
knowledge
that
camilla
affected
to
disdain
the
sea
and
any
of
its
connections
sidsall
appeared
and
took
her
place
with
a
collective
greeting
while
laurel
coming
out
of
her
abstraction
realized
that
they
were
discussing
the
subject
in
which
nearly
every
conversation
now
began
or
ended
the
solemn
speculation
of
why
her
uncle
gerrit
ammidon
master
of
the
ship
was
so
long
overdue
from
china
laurel
heard
this
from
two
angles
or
otherwise
when
her
grandfather
was
or
was
not
present
the
tone
of
the
first
far
more
encouraging
than
that
of
the
latter
her
father
was
speaking
my
opinion
is
that
he
was
unexpectedly
held
up
at
shanghai
it
a
new
port
for
us
and
captain
verney
tells
me
very
difficult
to
make
after
woosung
you
have
to
get
hold
of
two
bamboo
poles
stuck
up
on
the
bank
a
hundred
feet
apart
as
a
leading
mark
and
with
these
in
range
steer
for
the
bar
the
channel
is
very
narrow
and
he
says
the
would
have
to
wait
for
high
water
perhaps
for
the
spring
tide
she
may
have
got
ashore
strained
and
sprung
a
leak
and
had
to
discharge
her
cargo
for
repairs
that
never
gerrit
the
elder
replied
positively
there
is
a
better
master
afloat
he
can
smell
shoal
water
i
was
certain
we
hear
from
him
when
the
was
back
from
calcutta
do
you
suppose
william
that
he
took
the
about
the
horn
and
laurel
wondered
at
the
unmannerly
way
in
which
he
gulped
his
coffee
he
might
have
driven
into
the
antarctic
winter
he
proceeded
my
deck
was
swept
and
all
the
boats
stove
off
the
falklands
in
april
gerrit
got
a
ship
the
other
asserted
not
a
hermaphrodite
brig
built
like
a
butter
box
you
find
that
i
am
right
and
that
he
has
been
tied
up
in
port
i
made
eight
hundred
per
cent
on
a
first
cargo
for
my
owners
the
elder
retorted
then
there
was
trading
yes
and
sailing
too
no
chronometers
with
confounded
rates
of
variation
and
other
fancy
parlor
instruments
to
read
your
position
from
when
i
first
navigated
it
was
with
an
astrolabe
and
the
moon
a
master
knew
his
lead
latitude
and
lookout
then
eight
hundred
barrels
of
flour
and
pine
boards
to
rio
and
back
with
coffee
and
hides
for
salem
he
continued
then
out
to
gibraltar
and
brazil
with
wine
and
on
in
ballast
for
calcutta
tahiti
and
morea
the
sandwich
islands
and
the
feejees
sandalwood
and
tortoise
shell
and
beche
de
mer
sea
horses
teeth
and
saltpeter
for
the
chinese
government
i
do
want
to
hear
about
your
bills
of
exchange
and
kegs
of
spanish
dollars
and
solid
cargoes
of
tea
run
back
direct
why
with
your
canton
and
india
agents
and
sight
drafts
the
china
service
is
like
dealing
with
a
boston
store
laurel
saw
that
her
father
was
assuming
the
expression
of
restrained
annoyance
habitual
when
the
elder
contrasted
old
shipping
ways
with
new
unfortunately
he
said
the
patient
chinaman
will
no
longer
exchange
silks
and
lacquer
and
teas
for
boiled
sea
slugs
he
has
learned
to
demand
something
of
value
why
damn
it
william
the
other
exploded
nothing
more
valuable
to
a
chinese
than
his
belly
they
give
eighteen
hundred
dollars
a
pecul
for
birds
nests
any
day
as
for
your
insinuation
that
we
used
to
diddle
them
i
never
ran
opium
up
from
india
to
rot
their
souls
and
when
the
chinese
government
tried
to
stop
it
there
the
british
commercial
interests
forcing
it
on
them
with
cannon
in
look
at
the
pepper
we
brought
into
salem
he
was
laurel
realized
with
intense
interest
growing
beautifully
empurpled
lay
right
off
the
beach
at
mukka
and
did
business
with
the
dato
himself
we
forded
the
bags
on
the
crew
backs
across
a
river
with
muskets
served
in
case
the
bloody
heathen
drew
their
creeses
when
we
made
sail
everything
was
running
over
with
pepper
the
boats
and
forecastle
and
cabins
and
between
decks
well
father
the
heroic
times
are
done
of
course
i
ca
say
that
sorry
i
should
like
to
finance
a
voyage
that
reached
out
to
three
years
and
depended
on
the
captain
picking
up
six
or
seven
cargoes
the
old
man
rose
and
muttering
a
plainly
uncomplimentary
period
about
the
resemblance
of
modern
ship
owners
to
clerks
walked
with
his
heavy
careful
tread
from
the
room
you
are
so
foolish
to
argue
and
excite
him
william
wife
told
him
laurel
regarded
her
with
a
passionate
admiration
for
the
shining
hair
turning
smoothly
about
her
brow
and
drawn
over
her
ears
to
the
low
coil
in
the
back
for
her
brown
barége
dress
with
velvet
leaves
and
blue
and
tightest
of
long
sleeves
and
high
collar
and
because
generally
she
was
a
mother
to
be
owned
and
viewed
with
pride
she
met
laurel
gaze
with
a
little
friendly
nod
and
said
do
forget
about
your
clothes
and
i
think
you
ought
to
finish
the
practicing
before
dinner
so
you
be
free
for
a
walk
with
your
grandfather
in
the
afternoon
soon
after
laurel
stood
in
the
hall
viewing
with
disfavor
the
light
dress
she
had
put
on
so
gayly
at
rising
in
spite
of
her
sense
of
increasing
age
she
had
a
strong
desire
to
play
in
the
yard
and
climb
about
in
the
woodhouse
already
the
business
of
being
grown
up
began
to
pall
upon
her
the
outlook
dreary
that
included
nothing
but
a
whole
hour
at
the
piano
an
endless
care
of
her
skirts
and
the
slowest
kind
of
walk
through
washington
square
and
down
to
derby
wharf
where
no
matter
in
which
direction
and
for
what
purpose
they
started
forth
her
grandfather
way
invariably
led
janet
joined
her
and
they
stood
irresolutely
balancing
on
alternate
slippers
did
you
notice
the
former
volunteered
mother
is
letting
camilla
have
lots
of
starch
in
her
petticoats
so
that
they
stand
right
out
like
crinoline
was
she
hateful
this
morning
laurel
heard
a
slight
sound
at
her
back
and
wheeling
saw
her
grandfather
looking
out
from
the
library
door
a
swift
premonition
of
possible
additional
misfortune
seized
her
moving
toward
the
side
entrance
she
said
to
janet
we
better
be
going
right
away
it
was
however
too
late
well
little
girls
he
remarked
benevolently
since
miss
gomes
has
left
for
the
day
it
would
be
as
well
if
i
heard
your
geography
lesson
i
do
think
mother
intended
for
us
to
study
today
laurel
replied
making
a
face
of
appeal
for
janet
support
but
the
latter
remained
solidly
and
silently
neutral
what
what
the
elder
mildly
exploded
mutiny
in
the
forecastle
get
right
up
here
in
the
break
of
the
or
i
harry
you
he
stood
aside
while
laurel
and
janet
filed
into
the
library
geography
was
the
only
subject
their
grandfather
proposed
for
his
instruction
and
the
lesson
she
knew
might
take
any
one
of
several
directions
he
sometimes
heard
it
with
the
precision
of
miss
gomes
herself
he
might
substitute
for
the
regular
questions
such
queries
drawn
from
his
wide
voyages
as
he
thought
to
be
of
infinitely
greater
use
and
interest
or
better
still
he
frequently
gave
them
the
benefit
of
long
reminiscences
through
which
they
sat
blinking
in
a
mechanical
attention
or
slightly
wriggling
with
minds
far
away
from
the
old
man
periods
full
of
outlandish
names
and
places
and
when
he
got
excited
shocking
swears
he
turned
the
the
one
which
laurel
had
thought
of
as
a
ship
away
from
the
fireplace
now
covered
with
a
green
slatted
blind
for
the
summer
and
they
drew
forward
two
of
the
heavy
chairs
with
shining
claw
feet
that
stood
against
the
wall
smiley
geography
a
book
no
larger
than
the
shipmaster
hand
was
found
and
opened
to
hindoostan
or
india
within
the
ganges
there
was
a
dark
surprising
picture
of
hindoos
doing
penance
under
the
banyan
tree
and
a
confusing
view
of
the
himaleh
mountains
stuff
he
proceeded
gazing
with
disfavor
at
the
illustrations
this
ought
to
be
written
by
men
who
have
seen
the
world
and
know
its
tides
and
landmarks
do
you
suppose
he
demanded
heatedly
of
janet
that
the
fellow
who
put
this
together
ever
took
a
ship
through
the
formosa
channel
against
the
northeast
monsoon
no
sir
janet
replied
hastily
here
are
climate
and
face
of
the
country
and
religion
he
located
these
items
with
a
blunt
finger
but
i
ca
find
exports
i
lay
he
know
a
bengal
chintz
from
a
bundle
handkerchief
i
do
think
it
says
anything
about
exports
laurel
volunteered
we
have
the
boundaries
and
bilge
he
interrupted
sharply
i
did
fetch
boundaries
back
in
the
did
i
he
thrust
the
offending
volume
into
a
crevice
of
his
chair
laurel
he
added
what
is
the
outport
of
st
petersburg
cronstadt
she
answered
after
a
violent
searching
of
her
memory
and
for
manilla
he
turned
to
janet
i
ca
think
she
admitted
laurel
cavite
the
latter
pronounced
out
of
a
racking
mental
effort
just
so
and
he
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
the
port
for
boston
i
do
believe
we
had
that
she
said
firmly
his
gaze
fastened
on
her
so
intently
that
she
blushed
into
her
lap
do
believe
we
had
it
he
echoed
why
confound
it
he
paused
and
regarded
her
with
a
new
doubt
laurel
he
demanded
what
is
an
outport
she
had
a
distinct
feeling
of
justifiable
injury
a
recognized
part
of
the
present
system
of
examination
was
its
strict
limitation
to
questions
made
familiar
by
constant
repetition
and
this
last
was
entirely
new
she
was
sure
of
several
kinds
of
ports
one
they
had
after
dinner
another
indicated
a
certain
side
of
a
vessel
and
still
a
third
was
salem
but
an
outport
cronstadt
cavite
what
it
really
meant
what
they
were
had
escaped
her
she
decided
to
risk
an
opinion
an
outport
she
said
slowly
is
a
a
part
of
a
ship
that
much
seemed
safe
i
expect
it
the
place
where
they
throw
things
like
potato
peels
through
you
suppose
what
he
cried
breathing
quite
hard
a
place
where
they
he
broke
off
and
you
jeremy
ammidon
granddaughter
by
heaven
it
would
make
a
coolie
laugh
it
like
william
who
never
would
go
to
sea
to
have
four
daughters
in
place
of
a
son
i
done
with
you
go
tinker
on
the
piano
they
got
down
from
their
chairs
and
departed
with
an
only
half
concealed
eagerness
do
you
think
he
means
it
janet
asked
hopefully
and
he
never
have
any
geography
again
no
i
do
laurel
told
her
shortly
she
was
inwardly
ruffled
and
further
annoyed
at
janet
placid
acceptance
of
whatever
the
day
brought
along
janet
was
a
stick
she
turned
away
and
found
herself
facing
the
parlor
and
the
memory
of
the
impending
hour
of
practice
well
it
had
to
be
done
before
dinner
and
she
went
forward
with
dragging
feet
within
the
formal
shaded
space
of
the
chamber
she
stopped
to
speculate
on
the
varied
and
colorful
pictures
of
the
wall
paper
reaching
from
the
white
paneling
above
her
waist
to
the
deep
white
carving
at
the
ceiling
the
scene
which
absorbed
her
most
showed
elevated
above
a
smooth
stream
a
marble
pavilion
with
sweeping
steps
and
a
polite
company
about
a
reclining
gentleman
with
bare
arms
and
a
wreath
on
his
head
and
a
lady
in
flowing
robes
playing
pipes
to
the
right
in
deep
green
shadow
a
charmer
was
swinging
from
ropes
of
flowers
lovers
hid
behind
a
brown
mossy
trunk
while
on
the
left
against
a
weeping
willow
and
frowning
rock
four
serene
creatures
gathered
about
a
barge
with
a
gilded
prow
still
on
her
reluctant
progress
to
the
piano
she
stopped
to
examine
the
east
india
money
on
the
lowest
shelf
of
a
locked
corner
cupboard
there
was
a
tiresome
string
of
cash
with
a
rattan
twisted
through
their
square
holes
silver
customs
taels
and
mace
and
candareen
chinese
gold
leaf
and
fukien
dollars
coins
from
cochin
china
in
the
shape
of
india
ink
with
raised
edges
and
characters
old
carolus
hooked
dollars
sycee
silver
ingots
smooth
and
flat
above
but
roughly
oval
on
the
lower
surface
not
unlike
shoes
japanese
obangs
their
gold
stamped
and
beaten
out
almost
as
broad
as
a
hand
palm
mohurs
and
pieces
from
singapore
dutch
guilders
from
java
and
the
small
silver
and
gold
drops
of
siam
called
tical
she
arrived
finally
at
the
harplike
stool
of
the
piano
but
there
she
had
to
wait
until
the
clock
in
the
hall
above
struck
some
division
of
the
hour
for
her
guidance
and
she
rattled
the
brass
rings
that
formed
the
handles
of
drawers
on
either
side
of
the
keyboard
later
her
fingers
picking
a
precarious
way
through
bass
and
treble
she
heard
voice
at
the
door
the
latter
was
joined
by
their
mother
and
they
went
out
to
the
clatter
of
hoofs
the
thin
jingle
of
harness
chains
where
the
barouche
waited
for
them
in
the
street
once
camilla
obtruded
into
the
room
i
wonder
you
do
give
yourself
a
headache
she
remarked
i
never
heard
more
sounds
laurel
gathered
that
camilla
was
proud
of
this
expression
which
she
must
have
newly
caught
from
some
grown
person
she
considered
a
reply
but
nothing
sufficiently
crushing
occurring
she
ignored
the
other
in
a
difficult
transposition
of
her
hands
camilla
left
the
clock
above
struck
a
second
quarter
the
third
while
she
honestly
continued
her
efforts
up
until
the
first
actual
note
of
the
hour
thank
god
that
over
she
said
in
the
liberal
manner
of
a
shipmaster
now
only
the
walk
with
her
grandfather
remained
of
the
actively
tiresome
duties
of
the
day
after
dinner
the
sun
blazed
down
with
almost
the
heat
of
midsummer
and
laurel
felt
unexpectedly
indifferent
content
to
linger
in
the
house
only
too
soon
she
heard
inquiries
for
her
and
in
her
gaiter
boots
a
silk
bonnet
with
a
blue
scarf
tied
under
her
chin
and
flowing
over
a
shoulder
and
palm
leaf
cashmere
shawl
she
accompanied
the
old
man
across
pleasant
street
and
over
the
wide
green
square
to
the
arched
west
gate
with
its
gilt
eagle
and
essex
street
will
we
be
going
on
central
street
she
asked
no
reason
for
turning
down
there
he
replied
forgetful
of
the
gingerbread
shop
with
the
shaky
little
bell
inside
the
door
the
buttered
gingerbread
on
the
upper
shelf
for
three
cents
and
that
without
on
the
lower
for
two
she
gathered
her
hopes
now
about
webb
drugstore
where
her
grandfather
sometimes
stopped
for
a
talk
and
bought
her
rock
candy
gibraltars
or
blackjacks
it
was
too
hot
for
blackjacks
she
decided
and
with
opportunity
would
choose
the
cooling
peppermint
flavor
of
the
gibraltars
the
elms
on
essex
street
were
far
enough
in
leaf
to
cast
a
flickering
shade
in
the
faintly
salt
air
drifting
from
the
sea
and
they
progressed
so
slowly
that
laurel
was
able
to
study
the
contents
of
most
of
the
store
windows
they
passed
some
held
crewels
and
crimped
white
cakes
of
wax
gayly
colored
reticule
beads
with
a
wooden
spoon
for
a
penny
measure
and
strawberry
emery
balls
there
was
a
west
india
store
and
a
place
where
they
sold
oil
and
candles
another
had
charts
for
mariners
while
across
the
way
stood
the
east
india
marine
hall
here
her
grandfather
hesitated
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
go
over
and
join
the
masters
always
to
be
found
about
the
museum
but
in
the
end
he
continued
beyond
the
essex
house
with
its
iron
bow
and
lamp
over
the
entrance
past
cheapside
to
webb
drugstore
where
he
purchased
a
bag
of
peristaltic
lozenges
and
after
pretending
to
start
away
as
if
nothing
more
were
to
be
secured
there
the
gibraltars
they
were
returning
in
the
general
direction
of
derby
wharf
when
jeremy
ammidon
met
a
companion
of
past
days
at
sea
and
stopped
for
the
inevitable
conversational
exchange
the
latter
who
had
such
a
great
spreading
beard
that
laurel
could
determine
whether
or
not
he
wore
a
neck
scarf
said
barzil
dunsack
all
but
died
ha
the
other
exclaimed
laurel
wondered
at
the
indelicacy
in
speaking
about
old
captain
dunsack
to
her
grandfather
when
everyone
in
salem
knew
they
had
quarreled
years
ago
and
not
spoken
to
each
other
since
he
was
bad
off
he
persisted
a
cold
grappled
in
his
chest
and
went
into
lung
fever
barzil
looking
wasted
what
with
sickness
and
the
trouble
about
edward
at
a
nod
half
encouraging
he
added
it
appears
edward
left
heard
and
company
in
canton
and
took
ship
back
to
boston
he
there
now
for
what
i
know
never
sent
any
word
to
salem
or
his
father
looks
a
little
as
if
he
had
been
turned
out
of
his
berth
then
one
of
barzil
schooners
caught
the
edge
of
the
last
hurricane
off
the
great
bank
and
went
ashore
on
green
turtle
key
used
him
near
all
up
laurel
saw
that
her
grandfather
was
frowning
heavily
and
silently
moving
his
lips
the
other
left
them
standing
and
her
companion
brought
his
cane
down
sharply
boy
and
boy
he
said
barzil
was
a
good
man
looking
old
so
am
i
so
am
i
feet
almost
useless
laurel
he
addressed
her
i
want
you
to
go
right
on
home
i
got
to
stop
around
and
see
an
old
friend
who
has
been
sick
she
left
obediently
but
paused
once
to
gaze
back
incredulously
at
the
bulky
shape
of
her
grandfather
moving
toward
barzil
dunsack
that
quarrel
was
part
of
their
family
history
she
had
been
aware
of
it
as
long
as
she
had
of
the
solemn
clock
in
the
second
hall
and
not
very
far
back
perhaps
when
she
was
eight
it
had
taken
a
fresh
activity
of
discussion
around
the
person
of
her
uncle
gerrit
who
it
was
feared
might
now
be
drowned
at
sea
what
it
had
all
been
about
neither
she
nor
her
sisters
knew
for
not
only
was
the
subject
dropped
at
the
approach
of
any
of
them
but
they
were
forbidden
to
mention
it
at
home
she
was
unable
to
communicate
her
surprising
news
at
once
because
of
the
flood
of
talk
that
met
her
from
the
olive
wibird
and
lacy
her
cousin
were
engaged
with
sidsall
in
a
conversation
often
a
duet
and
sometimes
a
trio
laurel
took
a
seat
at
the
edge
of
the
chatter
and
followed
it
comprehensively
she
did
like
olive
wibird
who
would
greet
her
in
a
sugary
voice
but
elsewhere
olive
was
tremendously
admired
there
were
always
men
about
her
serenades
rising
from
the
lawn
beneath
her
window
and
laurel
herself
had
seen
olive
dressing
table
laden
with
bouquets
in
frilly
lace
paper
she
had
one
now
in
a
holder
of
with
a
gilt
chain
and
ring
her
wide
skirt
was
a
mass
of
knots
of
moss
roses
and
green
gauze
ribbons
while
a
silver
cord
ending
in
a
tassel
fell
forward
among
her
curls
lacy
saltonstone
almost
as
plainly
dressed
as
sidsall
was
as
usual
sitting
straighter
than
anyone
else
laurel
ever
saw
she
had
a
brown
face
with
a
finely
curved
nose
and
brown
eyes
and
her
voice
was
cool
and
decided
for
me
she
said
he
is
the
most
fascinating
person
in
salem
olive
wibird
made
a
swift
face
of
dissent
he
too
stiff
and
there
is
gray
in
his
hair
i
like
my
men
more
like
sparkling
hock
dancing
with
him
he
holds
you
as
if
you
were
glass
i
do
seem
to
remember
you
and
brevard
together
lacy
commented
he
has
asked
me
for
centuries
the
other
admitted
he
did
sidsall
though
as
we
all
remember
did
he
love
sidsall
cheeks
turned
bright
pink
laurel
dispassionately
wished
that
her
sister
would
make
such
a
show
of
herself
it
was
too
bad
that
sidsall
was
so
so
broad
and
well
looking
she
was
not
in
the
least
pale
or
interesting
and
had
neither
lacy
saltonstone
thin
gracefulness
nor
olive
popular
manner
it
was
very
noble
of
him
sidsall
agreed
but
he
was
extremely
engaged
lacy
assured
her
with
her
wide
slow
stare
he
told
me
that
you
were
like
apple
blossoms
that
might
please
sidsall
thought
laurel
but
she
personally
held
apple
blossoms
to
be
a
very
common
sort
of
flower
evidently
something
of
the
kind
had
occurred
to
olive
too
for
she
said
heaven
only
knows
what
men
will
admire
it
clear
they
do
like
a
prude
i
intend
to
have
a
good
time
until
i
get
married
but
what
if
you
love
in
vain
sidsall
interrupted
there
is
any
need
for
that
olive
told
her
when
i
see
a
man
i
want
i
going
to
get
him
it
easy
if
you
know
how
and
make
opportunities
i
always
have
one
garter
a
little
loose
laurel
her
sister
turned
i
certain
your
supper
is
ready
go
along
like
a
nice
child
in
her
room
a
woman
with
a
flat
worn
face
and
a
dusty
wisp
of
hair
across
her
neck
was
spreading
underlinen
ironed
into
beautiful
narrow
wisps
of
pleating
in
a
drawer
it
was
hodie
a
methodist
the
only
one
laurel
knew
and
the
latter
was
always
entranced
by
the
servant
religious
exclamations
doubts
and
audible
prayers
she
was
saying
something
now
about
pits
gauds
and
vanities
and
she
ended
a
short
profession
of
faith
with
an
amen
so
loud
and
sudden
that
laurel
although
she
was
waiting
for
it
jumped
it
was
past
seven
the
air
was
so
sweet
with
lilacs
that
they
seemed
to
be
blooming
in
her
room
and
the
sunlight
died
slowly
from
still
space
by
leaning
out
of
her
window
she
could
see
over
the
square
the
lamplighter
was
moving
along
its
wooden
fence
leaving
faint
twinkling
yellow
lights
and
there
were
little
gleams
from
the
windows
on
bath
street
beyond
the
gayety
of
her
morning
mood
was
replaced
by
a
dim
kind
of
wondering
her
thoughts
became
uncertain
like
the
objects
in
the
quivering
light
outside
the
palest
possible
star
shone
in
the
yellow
sky
she
had
to
look
hard
or
it
was
lost
janet
stirring
in
the
next
room
seemed
so
far
away
that
she
might
not
hear
her
laurel
no
matter
how
loudly
she
called
janet
she
cried
prompted
by
unreasoning
dread
you
to
yell
janet
complained
at
the
door
but
already
laurel
was
oblivious
of
her
she
had
seen
a
familiar
figure
slowly
crossing
washington
square
her
grandfather
coming
home
from
captain
dunsack
gracious
how
poky
he
was
she
was
glad
that
she
was
dragging
along
at
his
side
he
seemed
bigger
and
rounder
than
usual
she
heard
the
tap
of
his
cane
as
he
left
the
common
for
pleasant
street
then
his
feet
moved
and
stopped
moved
and
stopped
up
the
steps
of
their
house
she
was
sorry
now
that
she
had
known
what
an
outport
was
and
determined
to
ask
him
she
liked
his
stories
that
camilla
disdained
about
crews
and
hong
kong
and
the
stormy
cape
the
thought
of
cape
horn
brought
back
the
memory
of
her
uncle
gerrit
absent
in
the
ship
her
mental
pictures
of
him
were
not
clear
he
was
almost
always
at
sea
but
she
remembered
his
eyes
which
were
very
confusing
to
encounter
and
his
hair
parted
and
carelessly
brushing
the
bottoms
of
his
ears
laurel
recalled
hearing
that
gerrit
was
his
father
favorite
and
she
suddenly
understood
something
of
the
unhappiness
that
weighed
upon
the
old
man
she
hoped
desperately
that
janet
or
camilla
would
come
in
and
laugh
at
her
for
crying
in
bed
she
saw
that
the
room
was
rapidly
filling
with
dusk
only
yesterday
she
would
have
told
herself
that
the
dragon
in
the
teakwood
chair
was
stirring
but
now
laurel
could
see
that
it
never
moved
she
rocked
like
the
little
boats
that
crossed
the
harbor
or
came
in
from
the
ships
anchored
beyond
the
wharves
and
settled
into
a
sleep
like
a
great
placid
sea
flooding
the
world
of
her
home
and
the
lamplighter
and
her
grandfather
sorrowing
for
uncle
gerrit
ii
when
jeremy
ammidon
sent
his
granddaughter
home
alone
and
turned
toward
captain
dunsack
on
hardy
street
he
stopped
for
a
moment
to
approve
the
diminishing
sturdy
figure
all
william
children
though
they
were
girls
were
remarkably
handsome
with
glowing
red
cheeks
and
clear
eyes
tumbling
masses
of
hair
and
a
generous
vigor
of
body
he
sighed
at
laurel
superabundant
youth
and
moved
carefully
forward
he
was
very
heavy
and
his
progress
was
uncertain
his
thoughts
were
divided
between
the
present
and
the
past
barzil
dunsack
aged
and
ill
and
unfortunate
and
the
happening
long
ago
that
had
resulted
in
a
separation
of
years
after
a
close
youthful
companionship
it
had
occurred
while
barzil
was
master
of
the
brig
owned
by
billy
gray
and
he
jeremy
was
first
mate
in
the
exactness
with
which
he
recalled
every
detail
of
his
life
in
ships
he
remembered
that
at
the
time
they
were
off
bourbon
island
about
a
hundred
and
ten
miles
southwest
of
the
lie
de
france
the
was
close
hauled
and
while
barzil
was
giving
an
order
at
the
wheel
she
fetched
a
bad
lee
lurch
and
sent
him
in
a
heap
across
the
deck
striking
his
head
against
the
bumkin
bitts
he
had
got
up
dazed
but
not
apparently
seriously
injured
and
after
his
head
had
been
swabbed
and
bound
by
the
steward
he
returned
to
the
poop
there
however
his
conduct
had
been
so
peculiar
among
other
things
sending
down
the
watch
to
put
on
sunday
rig
against
a
possible
hail
by
the
lord
that
after
a
long
consultation
with
patterson
the
second
mate
and
the
boatswain
and
a
brief
announcement
to
the
crew
he
jeremy
ammidon
had
taken
command
in
their
interest
and
that
of
the
owner
barzil
had
made
difficulties
patterson
struck
up
a
leveled
pistol
in
the
master
hand
just
as
it
exploded
they
had
confined
him
in
charge
of
the
unhappy
steward
to
his
cabin
where
after
he
had
completely
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
blow
and
jeremy
had
been
upheld
by
the
authorities
at
table
bay
he
stubbornly
remained
until
the
had
been
warped
into
salem
from
the
moment
of
their
landing
they
had
not
exchanged
a
word
jeremy
was
surprised
to
find
himself
at
present
bound
toward
the
other
house
he
was
not
certain
that
barzil
would
even
see
him
but
he
muttered
the
thing
had
lasted
long
enough
they
were
too
old
for
such
foolishness
and
the
other
had
come
into
adverse
winds
now
when
he
should
be
lying
quietly
in
a
snug
harbor
he
had
never
paid
serious
attention
to
the
threatened
complication
two
or
three
years
before
when
gerrit
had
been
seen
repeatedly
with
kate
dunsack
irregularly
born
daughter
he
was
sorry
for
the
two
women
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
man
had
been
shipped
drunk
by
some
boarding
house
runner
anyhow
only
the
second
day
out
vollar
had
been
lost
overboard
from
the
yard
and
kate
child
born
outside
the
law
it
was
hard
he
told
himself
again
walking
down
orange
street
past
the
custom
house
to
derby
the
girl
nettie
vollar
they
had
adopted
the
father
name
was
attractive
in
a
decided
french
way
with
crisp
black
hair
a
pert
nose
and
dimple
and
why
good
heavens
or
two
years
old
if
she
was
a
week
how
time
did
run
it
was
nothing
extraordinary
if
gerrit
had
been
seen
a
time
or
two
with
her
on
the
street
or
even
if
he
had
called
at
the
dunsacks
barzil
and
his
quarrel
did
extend
to
all
the
members
of
their
families
and
as
for
the
dunsacks
being
common
that
was
nonsense
barzil
was
as
good
as
he
any
day
only
where
he
had
prospered
and
moved
up
into
a
showy
place
on
the
common
the
other
had
had
the
head
winds
through
no
fault
of
his
own
the
reputation
had
fastened
on
him
of
being
unlucky
in
his
cargoes
if
he
carried
tea
and
colonial
exports
to
say
antwerp
they
would
have
been
declared
contraband
while
he
was
at
sea
and
seized
on
the
docks
he
had
been
blown
in
an
impenetrable
fog
ashore
on
tierra
del
fuego
and
barely
making
cape
pembroke
had
been
obliged
to
beach
his
ship
a
total
loss
then
there
was
kate
trouble
barzil
was
a
rigorously
moral
and
religious
man
and
his
pain
at
that
last
must
have
been
heavy
jeremy
ammidon
mind
turned
to
gerrit
his
son
this
interest
in
nettie
vollar
if
it
had
existed
was
characteristic
of
the
boy
who
had
a
quick
heart
and
an
honest
disdain
for
the
muddling
narrow
ways
of
the
land
he
would
have
sought
her
out
simply
from
the
instinct
to
protest
against
the
smugness
of
salem
opinion
a
fine
sailor
and
a
master
at
a
great
one
to
carry
sail
yet
in
the
sixteen
years
of
his
commands
he
had
had
no
more
serious
accident
than
the
loss
of
a
mast
or
splitting
a
couple
of
courses
it
was
gerrit
ability
the
splendid
qualities
of
his
ship
that
made
jeremy
hope
he
would
still
come
sailing
into
the
harbor
with
some
narration
of
delay
and
danger
overcome
he
was
now
on
derby
street
in
a
region
of
rigging
and
sail
lofts
block
and
pump
makers
ships
stores
spar
yards
gilders
carvers
and
workers
in
metal
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
tar
and
new
canvas
and
the
flat
odor
that
rose
at
low
water
sailors
passed
yellow
powerful
scandinavians
and
dark
men
with
earrings
from
southern
latitudes
in
red
or
checked
shirts
blue
dungarees
and
glazed
black
hats
with
trailing
ribbons
or
in
cheap
and
clumsy
shore
clothes
there
was
a
scraping
of
fiddle
from
an
upper
window
the
sound
of
heavy
capering
feet
and
the
stale
laughter
of
harborside
women
on
hardy
street
he
continued
to
the
last
house
at
the
right
the
farther
side
of
which
gave
across
a
yard
of
uneven
bricks
straggling
bushes
and
aged
splitting
apple
trees
and
an
expanse
of
lush
grass
ending
abruptly
in
a
wooden
embankment
and
the
water
a
short
fence
turned
in
from
the
sidewalk
to
the
front
door
where
jeremy
knocked
a
long
pause
followed
in
which
he
became
first
impatient
and
then
irritable
and
he
was
lifting
his
hand
for
a
second
summons
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
he
was
facing
kate
vollar
there
was
only
a
faint
trace
of
surprise
on
her
apathetic
jeremy
ammidon
called
it
moonlike
countenance
as
if
her
overwhelming
mischance
had
robbed
her
features
of
all
further
expressions
of
interest
or
concern
i
heard
jeremy
said
in
a
voice
pitched
loud
enough
to
conceal
any
inward
uncertainty
that
your
father
had
been
sick
met
captain
rendell
on
essex
street
and
he
said
barzil
had
lung
fever
thought
i
see
if
there
was
any
truth
in
it
he
just
managed
to
stay
alive
kate
vollar
replied
gazing
at
him
with
her
stilled
gray
eyes
but
he
better
now
though
he
not
up
and
about
yet
shall
i
tell
him
that
that
you
are
here
yes
just
say
jeremy
ammidon
below
and
would
like
to
pass
a
greeting
with
him
he
followed
the
woman
in
and
entered
a
large
gloomy
chamber
while
she
mounted
the
stair
leading
directly
from
the
front
the
blackened
fireplace
gaping
uncovered
for
the
summer
the
woodwork
painted
yellow
with
an
artificial
graining
and
a
stiff
set
of
ebonized
chairs
their
dingy
crimson
plush
backs
protected
by
elaborate
thread
antimacassars
seemed
to
hold
and
reflect
the
misfortunes
of
their
owner
jeremy
picked
up
an
ostrich
egg
painted
with
a
clump
of
viciously
green
coconut
palms
and
a
cottony
surf
he
put
it
down
with
an
absent
smile
and
impatiently
fingered
a
volume
of
the
life
of
harriet
atwood
newell
she
was
one
of
the
missionaries
who
had
gone
out
on
the
with
augustine
heard
to
india
but
forbidden
to
land
there
had
died
not
long
after
on
the
île
de
france
houqua
was
a
damned
good
heathen
he
said
aloud
and
so
was
nasservanjee
he
left
the
table
and
proceeded
to
a
window
opening
upon
the
harbor
here
fretted
with
wharves
a
barque
was
fast
in
a
small
dock
newly
in
his
practiced
glance
saw
from
a
blue
water
voyage
africa
probably
her
standing
gear
was
in
a
perfection
and
beauty
of
order
that
spoke
of
long
tranquil
days
in
the
trades
and
that
no
mere
harbor
riggers
could
hope
to
accomplish
the
deck
was
burdened
with
the
ugly
confusion
of
unloading
jeremy
studied
the
jibs
stowed
in
harbor
covers
the
raking
masts
and
tapering
royal
poles
over
the
stolid
roofs
ordinarily
seeing
no
more
he
could
not
only
name
a
vessel
trading
out
of
salem
but
from
her
rig
recognize
anyone
of
a
score
of
masters
who
otherwise
unheralded
might
be
in
command
however
here
he
was
at
a
loss
and
he
thought
again
of
the
change
the
decline
that
had
overtaken
salem
shipping
the
celebrated
merchants
the
pennants
of
william
gray
he
reflected
had
flown
from
the
main
truck
of
fifteen
ships
seven
barques
thirteen
brigs
and
schooners
ammidon
ammidon
and
saltonstone
in
spite
of
his
vehement
protests
the
counsel
of
the
oldest
member
of
the
firm
were
moving
shipment
by
shipment
all
their
business
to
boston
listening
to
the
promptings
of
state
street
and
central
wharf
to
the
right
was
the
sagging
landing
from
which
barzil
schooners
sailed
trading
with
the
west
indies
and
back
of
it
and
of
his
house
stood
the
small
office
his
mind
had
turned
to
this
inconsiderable
commerce
when
kate
vollar
entered
and
told
him
that
her
father
would
see
him
barzil
dunsack
was
propped
up
in
bed
in
a
room
above
that
in
which
jeremy
had
been
waiting
he
totally
different
from
the
other
showed
his
age
in
sunken
dry
cheeks
a
forehead
like
an
arch
of
bone
and
a
thick
short
gray
beard
a
long
faded
lock
of
hair
had
been
hastily
brushed
forward
and
an
incongruously
bright
knitted
scarf
drawn
about
his
shoulders
jeremy
ammidon
concealed
his
dismay
not
only
at
barzil
wrecked
being
but
at
the
dismal
aspect
of
the
interior
the
worn
rugs
with
their
pieces
of
once
bright
material
frayed
and
loose
the
splitting
veneer
of
an
old
chest
of
drawers
and
blistered
mirror
above
a
dusty
iron
grate
you
have
got
in
among
the
rocks
he
exclaimed
still
they
tell
me
weathered
the
worst
copper
bound
and
oak
ribs
do
build
them
like
that
barzil
dunsack
eyes
were
bright
and
searching
behind
spectacles
and
he
studied
jeremy
without
replying
well
is
there
a
salute
in
you
the
latter
demanded
incensed
i
not
a
malay
proa
the
grim
shadow
of
a
smile
dawned
on
barzil
countenance
i
mind
one
hanging
on
our
quarter
by
formosa
he
returned
i
trained
a
cannon
aft
and
fired
a
shot
when
she
sheered
off
that
was
in
the
in
a
long
silence
enveloped
them
jeremy
mind
was
thronged
with
memories
of
ports
and
storms
mates
and
ships
and
logged
days
remember
oahu
like
it
was
when
we
first
made
it
he
queried
and
the
kanaka
girls
swimming
out
to
the
ship
with
hybiscus
flowers
in
their
hair
yes
and
the
anchorage
at
tahiti
with
the
swells
pounding
on
the
coral
reef
and
papeete
under
the
mountain
it
was
nice
there
in
the
afternoon
lying
off
the
beach
with
the
white
cottages
among
the
palms
and
orange
trees
and
the
band
playing
in
the
grove
by
government
house
captain
dunsack
frowned
at
the
trivial
character
of
these
memories
he
muttered
something
about
the
weight
of
the
lord
and
the
carnal
hearts
of
the
men
in
ships
jeremy
declared
stuff
he
wink
at
a
sailor
man
with
hardly
a
free
day
on
shore
it
was
bad
at
calcutta
either
with
an
awning
on
the
watching
the
carriages
and
syces
in
the
maidan
and
maybe
a
corpse
or
two
floating
about
the
gangway
from
the
burning
ghauts
a
mean
entrance
barzil
dunsack
asserted
i
do
know
a
worse
with
the
southwest
monsoon
in
the
bay
of
bengal
and
the
pilot
brigs
gone
from
the
sand
heads
that
where
heard
got
pounded
with
the
drawing
nineteen
feet
and
eighteen
on
the
bar
shook
the
reefs
out
of
his
topsails
laid
her
on
her
beam
ends
and
with
some
inches
saved
scraped
in
pick
up
the
three
juggernaut
pagodas
of
ganjam
jeremy
remarked
absently
shalt
have
no
other
god
jeremy
with
a
glint
in
his
eye
asked
was
your
last
consignment
of
west
india
molasses
marked
medford
you
always
were
a
scoffer
the
other
replied
unmoved
how
nettie
jeremy
ammidon
inquired
with
a
deliberate
show
of
interest
barzil
lips
tightened
i
have
seen
her
for
a
little
he
replied
she
been
visiting
at
ipswich
jeremy
added
a
good
girl
but
the
man
in
bed
made
no
further
comment
his
undimmed
gaze
was
fastened
upon
a
wall
his
mouth
folded
in
a
hard
line
on
a
harsh
and
deeply
seamed
countenance
an
able
man
pursued
by
bad
luck
nothing
been
heard
from
gerrit
jeremy
said
after
a
little
still
the
other
kept
silent
his
face
darkened
by
god
if
barzil
had
a
decent
word
for
the
fact
that
gerrit
was
seven
months
overdue
perhaps
lost
this
was
not
a
house
for
him
i
say
that
we
had
nothing
from
my
son
since
he
lay
in
the
pass
off
hong
kong
he
repeated
sharply
a
spasm
of
suffering
instantly
controlled
passed
over
barzil
face
gerrit
called
once
and
again
before
he
last
sailed
for
montevideo
he
finally
pronounced
i
stopped
it
and
he
left
in
a
temper
i
i
have
another
mortal
sin
here
like
kate
do
you
mean
that
gerrit
loose
jeremy
hotly
demanded
rising
a
more
honorable
boy
never
breathed
barzil
was
cold
i
told
him
not
to
come
back
he
repeated
it
would
only
lead
to
to
shamefulness
jeremy
shook
his
cane
toward
the
bed
i
may
be
a
scoffer
he
cried
but
i
would
hold
a
judgment
over
a
child
of
mine
i
not
so
damned
holy
that
i
can
look
down
on
a
misfortunate
girl
if
gerrit
did
come
to
see
nettie
and
the
boy
had
a
liking
for
her
why
you
drove
away
a
cursed
good
husband
and
if
you
think
for
a
minute
i
would
welcome
her
because
that
vollar
fell
off
a
yard
before
he
could
find
a
preacher
you
an
old
fool
nettie
must
bear
her
burden
far
better
be
dead
than
a
stumbling
block
well
i
rather
be
a
drunken
pierhead
jumper
on
the
waterloo
road
than
any
such
pious
blue
nose
i
tell
you
this
too
i
hate
to
ship
afore
the
mast
under
you
for
all
you
have
the
ensign
on
the
booby
hatch
with
prayers
read
sunday
morning
i
do
wonder
you
got
into
weather
have
no
word
for
a
creator
who
did
blow
in
your
eye
i
listen
to
no
blasphemy
captain
ammidon
barzil
dunsack
said
sternly
and
i
speak
my
mind
captain
dunsack
it
this
your
girls
are
a
long
sight
too
good
for
you
or
for
any
other
judgmatical
devil
dodger
he
stood
fuming
at
the
door
good
afternoon
to
you
barzil
dunsack
reclined
with
his
gaunt
bearded
head
sunk
forward
on
his
thin
chest
swathed
in
the
gay
worsted
wrap
his
wasted
hands
the
tendons
corded
with
pale
violet
veins
clenched
outside
the
checkered
quilt
beneath
which
his
body
made
scarcely
a
mark
outside
in
the
soft
glow
of
beginning
dusk
jeremy
blamed
himself
bitterly
for
his
anger
at
the
sick
man
he
had
gone
to
see
him
in
a
spirit
friendly
with
old
memories
forgetful
of
their
long
quarrel
in
the
stirred
emotions
of
the
past
days
of
youth
and
first
manhood
and
he
had
shouted
at
barzil
as
if
he
were
a
lubber
at
the
masthead
he
realized
that
in
order
to
be
in
time
for
supper
he
must
turn
toward
the
common
and
home
but
his
gaze
caught
the
spars
of
the
strange
barque
and
mechanically
he
made
his
way
over
a
narrow
grassy
passage
to
the
wharf
she
was
the
of
marblehead
and
he
recognized
from
a
glance
at
the
cargo
that
she
had
been
out
to
the
east
coast
of
africa
mozambique
and
zanzibar
aden
and
muscat
a
matted
frail
of
dates
swung
ponderously
in
air
there
were
baled
goatskins
and
sacks
of
mocha
coffee
sagging
baskets
of
reddish
unwashed
gum
copal
carried
in
bulk
and
a
mate
smoking
a
dutch
cigar
was
supervising
the
moving
of
elephant
tusks
in
a
milky
glimmer
of
ivory
ashore
there
was
a
vague
murmur
of
the
rising
tide
beyond
the
wharves
and
warehouses
the
water
was
faintly
rippled
in
silver
and
rose
and
a
ship
was
standing
into
the
harbor
with
all
her
canvas
spread
to
the
light
wind
he
turned
away
with
a
sigh
and
walked
slowly
up
toward
the
elms
of
pleasant
street
at
his
front
door
he
stopped
to
regard
the
polished
brass
plate
where
in
place
of
his
name
he
had
caused
to
be
engraved
the
words
java
head
they
held
for
him
coming
into
this
pleasant
dwelling
after
so
many
tumultuous
years
at
sea
the
symbol
of
the
safe
and
happy
end
of
an
arduous
voyage
just
as
the
high
black
rock
of
java
head
thrusting
up
over
the
horizon
promised
the
placidity
and
accomplishment
of
the
sunda
strait
whenever
he
noticed
the
plate
he
felt
again
the
relief
of
coasting
that
northerly
shore
he
saw
the
mate
forward
with
the
crew
passing
the
chains
through
the
hawse
pipes
and
shackling
them
to
the
anchors
the
island
rose
from
level
groves
of
shore
palms
to
lofty
blue
peaks
terraced
with
rice
and
kina
plantations
with
shining
streams
and
green
kananga
flowers
and
tamarinds
the
land
breeze
fragrant
with
clove
buds
and
cinnamon
came
off
to
the
ship
in
the
vaporous
dusk
and
in
the
blazing
sunlight
of
morning
the
anjer
sampans
swarmed
out
with
a
shrill
chatter
of
brilliant
birds
monkeys
and
naked
brown
humanity
piled
with
dark
green
oranges
and
limes
and
purple
mangosteen
in
the
last
few
years
particularly
with
gerrit
away
he
had
turned
more
and
more
from
the
surroundings
of
his
house
rather
it
had
become
william
house
to
an
inner
life
of
memories
his
own
active
life
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
infinitely
fuller
more
purposeful
and
various
than
that
of
present
existence
at
java
head
all
salem
had
been
different
he
had
a
certain
contempt
for
the
existence
of
his
son
william
and
the
latter
associates
and
friends
he
had
said
that
the
trading
now
done
in
ships
was
like
dealing
at
a
boston
store
and
the
merchants
reminded
him
of
storekeepers
the
old
days
when
a
voyage
was
a
public
affair
and
a
ship
manifest
posted
in
the
custom
house
on
which
anyone
might
write
himself
down
for
a
varying
part
of
the
responsibility
and
profit
had
given
place
to
closed
capital
the
passages
from
port
to
port
with
the
captain
as
often
as
not
his
own
supercargo
and
a
figure
of
importance
had
become
scheduled
affairs
in
which
a
master
was
subjected
to
any
countinghouse
clerk
with
an
order
from
the
firm
the
ships
themselves
were
fast
being
ruined
he
was
in
his
room
after
supper
seated
momentarily
on
a
day
bed
with
a
covering
of
white
siberian
fox
skins
and
he
pronounced
aloud
in
a
tone
of
satirical
contempt
the
single
word
clipper
nearly
everyone
in
the
shipping
business
seemed
to
have
been
touched
by
this
madness
for
the
ridiculous
ideas
of
an
experimental
griffiths
and
his
model
of
a
ship
with
the
bows
turned
inside
out
the
greatest
beam
aft
and
a
dead
rise
like
an
inverted
roof
that
the
the
initial
result
of
this
insanity
had
capsized
at
her
launching
had
been
due
to
some
freak
of
chance
just
as
her
miraculous
preservation
through
a
voyage
or
so
to
china
could
have
been
made
possible
only
by
continuously
mild
weather
even
if
the
had
been
fast
her
run
was
called
days
out
to
canton
and
home
in
it
was
absurd
to
suppose
that
there
had
been
the
usual
monsoon
and
if
she
did
come
in
a
little
ahead
of
vessels
built
on
a
solid
model
why
her
hold
had
no
cargo
capacity
worth
the
name
things
on
the
seas
were
going
to
the
devil
he
moved
down
to
the
library
where
he
lighted
a
cheroot
and
addressed
himself
to
the
but
his
restlessness
increased
the
paper
drooped
and
his
thoughts
turned
to
gerrit
as
a
small
boy
he
saw
him
leaving
home
for
the
first
time
to
go
to
the
school
at
andover
in
a
cloth
cap
with
a
glazed
peak
striped
long
pantaloons
and
blue
coat
and
waistcoat
later
at
the
high
desk
in
the
of
ammidon
ammidon
and
saltonstone
then
sailing
as
supercargo
on
one
of
the
company
ships
to
russia
and
liverpool
he
had
soon
dropped
such
clerking
for
seamen
duties
and
his
rise
to
mastership
had
been
rapid
rhoda
william
wife
entered
and
stood
before
him
accusingly
you
are
worrying
again
she
declared
in
here
all
by
yourself
it
really
seems
as
if
you
did
believe
in
our
interest
or
affection
i
have
a
feeling
and
you
know
they
are
always
right
that
gerrit
will
sail
into
the
harbor
any
day
now
he
had
always
liked
rhoda
a
large
handsome
woman
with
rich
coloring
her
countenance
somehow
reminded
him
of
an
apricot
and
fine
clothes
she
paused
studied
him
for
a
moment
and
then
asked
was
your
call
on
captain
dunsack
pleasant
it
ought
to
have
been
he
confided
but
i
got
mad
and
talked
like
a
dutch
uncle
and
barzil
went
off
on
a
holy
tack
about
nettie
vollar
jeremy
nodded
look
here
rhoda
he
demanded
did
gerrit
ever
say
anything
to
you
about
her
yes
she
told
him
gerrit
was
very
frank
did
he
like
the
girl
i
could
make
that
out
but
if
there
had
been
well
something
unusual
in
her
circumstances
i
think
he
would
never
have
noticed
her
gerrit
is
a
curious
mixture
a
very
impressionable
heart
and
a
contrary
stubborn
will
he
was
sorry
for
nettie
and
at
the
way
a
great
many
people
treated
her
threw
himself
into
opposition
nettie
father
made
him
very
mad
and
gerrit
pretty
well
damned
all
salem
before
he
left
in
the
he
was
excruciatingly
funny
you
know
gerrit
can
be
particularly
when
he
imitates
anybody
i
think
being
away
at
sea
a
great
deal
and
having
absolute
command
of
everything
give
men
a
different
view
of
things
from
ours
what
is
terribly
important
to
salem
hardly
touches
gerrit
it
all
silly
pretense
or
worse
to
him
i
would
mind
that
if
it
were
for
the
sense
of
humor
that
leads
him
into
the
wildest
extravagances
and
the
fact
that
he
act
on
his
feelings
you
know
i
devoted
to
him
but
i
give
a
sigh
of
relief
whenever
he
gets
away
on
his
ship
without
doing
any
one
of
the
hundred
insanities
he
threatens
gerrit
like
me
he
said
more
than
william
she
agreed
william
is
never
impetuous
and
often
impatient
with
his
brother
he
a
splendid
husband
but
gerrit
would
make
a
wonderful
lover
i
thankful
i
never
fell
into
his
affections
too
wearing
for
an
indolent
woman
you
been
a
great
comfort
and
pleasure
rhoda
he
told
her
i
only
wish
gerrit
could
marry
someone
like
you
but
who
would
give
him
sons
she
interrupted
it
just
as
you
say
about
him
and
i
always
been
uneasy
god
knows
what
he
wo
do
on
land
william
a
great
deal
happier
for
all
his
brother
humor
i
joke
william
but
he
very
satisfactory
and
solid
he
make
port
if
he
does
get
tied
up
with
newfangled
notions
why
it
stands
to
reason
that
a
ship
built
like
a
knife
would
double
up
in
the
seas
off
the
falklands
he
has
a
lot
of
confidence
in
mr
mckay
mckay
is
a
good
man
unsettled
the
is
a
fine
barque
and
his
packet
ships
are
as
seaworthy
as
any
but
his
indignation
increased
so
that
he
sputtered
and
rhoda
laughed
now
your
girls
he
added
fine
models
all
of
them
plenty
of
beam
work
in
any
kind
of
weather
that
very
complimentary
she
assured
him
rising
you
must
worry
about
gerrit
remember
my
predictions
never
fail
when
she
had
gone
his
mind
returned
to
storms
he
had
safely
weathered
the
gray
gales
of
cape
horn
black
hurricanes
and
the
explosive
tempests
in
eastern
straits
and
seas
he
took
from
the
drawer
of
a
bookcase
with
glass
doors
set
in
geometrical
pattern
a
thin
volume
bound
in
black
boards
a
paper
label
was
inscribed
in
a
small
carefully
formed
script
journal
of
my
intended
voyage
from
salem
to
the
east
indies
in
the
ship
he
opened
at
random

strong

shipped
a
very
heavy
sea
that
carried
away
the
bulwarks
on
the
larboard
quarter
and
stove
those
on
the
starboard
quarter
and
amidships
upper
cabin
filled
with
water
through
the
night
strong
gales
lightning
at
all
points
of
the
compass
the
memory
of
this
night
six
days
out
from
manilla
to
hong
kong
was
clearer
than
the
actuality
of
the
room
in
which
he
sat
an
old
man
with
his
activity
his
strength
his
manhood
far
behind
him
a
hulk
at
ten
split
the
mainsail
in
pieces
close
reefed

october
seventh
sunday
comes
in
with
strong
gales
and
a
heavy

both
officers
crippled
and
man
laid
up
through
the
night
the
same
leaking
badly
a
great
number
of
junks
in
sight
and
so
at
five
come
to
anchor
he
had
been
a
good
man
then
sixteen
days
on
the
without
going
below
insensible
to
ice
or
fever
or
weariness
he
had
been
autocratic
too
and
had
his
boy
servant
carrying
areca
nuts
chunam
and
tobacco
in
two
silk
bags
another
with
a
fan
and
a
third
holding
an
umbrella
such
things
were
all
over
now
he
understood
in
this
driving
age
his
mind
continually
returned
to
gerrit
to
dwell
on
the
vast
number
of
perils
held
in
store
by
the
sea
there
was
always
the
possibility
of
scurvy
an
entire
crew
rotting
alive
in
the
forecastle
and
the
ship
broached
to
dismasted
of
mutiny
the
sheer
smothering
finality
of
volcanic
waves
he
had
never
realized
until
now
in
the
misery
of
uncertainty
the
hellish
loneliness
of
a
shipmaster
at
sea
the
pride
of
duty
the
necessity
of
discipline
that
put
him
beyond
all
counsel
all
assistance
and
human
interdependence
jeremy
who
had
arrogantly
accepted
this
responsibility
without
a
question
through
so
many
long
years
and
voyages
now
dreaded
it
found
it
an
inhuman
burden
for
his
son
william
could
be
expected
to
appreciate
the
difficulties
of
his
brother
position
all
the
former
experience
had
been
got
when
with
james
saltonstone
and
a
party
of
salem
merchants
he
ventured
to
the
lighthouse
at
the
entrance
of
the
harbor
had
a
cold
collation
and
returned
with
the
pilot
or
in
the
custom
house
sloop
these
occasions
of
huzzas
and
salutes
and
speeches
were
supplemented
with
a
hasty
inspection
now
and
then
of
a
vessel
lying
still
at
the
wharf
with
sails
harbor
furled
william
guessed
little
of
the
long
effort
through
which
a
ship
won
from
the
first
of
those
moments
to
the
last
he
was
solely
concerned
with
the
returns
of
the
cargo
however
rhoda
was
right
and
this
mooning
would
bring
gerrit
into
port
he
turned
to
the
bookcase
where
a
squat
bottle
of
medford
rum
rested
beside
a
tumbler
after
a
drink
he
lighted
a
cheroot
and
smoking
vigorously
with
hands
clasped
behind
him
paced
back
and
forth
in
an
undeviating
line
between
the
door
to
the
hall
and
a
dark
polished
secretary
he
had
bought
in
london
while
he
was
walking
camilla
came
into
the
room
and
sedately
took
a
seat
on
one
of
the
formal
chairs
against
the
wall
i
guess
you
think
the
deck
of
a
ship
she
said
conversationally
he
regarded
her
with
a
faint
threatening
glint
of
humor
camilla
dignity
was
stupendous
particularly
now
when
he
observed
her
skirts
stood
out
in
a
thoroughly
grown
manner
he
liked
laurel
best
of
william
children
she
had
in
spite
of
her
confusion
in
regard
to
outports
a
surprising
grasp
upon
many
of
the
details
of
life
on
shipboard
and
a
largeness
of
manner
and
expression
entertaining
in
a
little
girl
sidsall
was
the
most
ingratiating
she
had
gerrit
direct
kindling
gaze
janet
showed
no
individuality
yet
beyond
an
entire
willingness
to
conform
to
outward
circumstance
while
pursuing
deeply
secret
speculations
within
but
camilla
impressed
the
entire
family
by
the
rigidity
of
her
correctness
in
personal
and
social
niceties
at
times
he
felt
she
would
be
a
nuisance
but
for
the
firm
hand
of
her
mother
and
his
own
contribution
to
their
by
an
occasional
sly
sally
it
might
be
that
he
admitted
if
it
were
for
the
facts
that
it
a
house
and
library
and
i
an
old
man
and
you
not
at
all
like
the
second
mate
i
should
hope
not
she
replied
decidedly
a
second
mate
anything
and
i
am
a
a
young
lady
anyhow
you
soon
be
out
at
dances
i
go
to
parties
now
that
is
mother
let
me
stay
at
the
coggswells
on
thursday
until
the
men
came
at
nine
for
sangaree
and
i
at
all
the
ballad
soirées
he
made
a
gesture
of
pretended
surprise
and
admiration
i
do
suppose
they
ever
have
a
good
chantey
with
the
stuff
they
play
he
queried
dear
me
no
dempster
sings
the
indian
lament
and
the
may
queen
that
a
cantata
and
it
in
three
parts
jeremy
began
to
hum
and
in
a
moment
was
intoning
in
a
loud
monotonous
voice
sweeping
a
hand
up
and
down
to
my
hero
bangedero
singing
hey
for
a
gay
hash
girl
i
do
think
that
very
nice
she
said
primly
what
do
you
mean
not
very
nice
he
demanded
incensed
nothing
finer
with
a
rousing
chanteyman
leading
it
and
the
watch
hauling
on
the
braces
you
never
hear
the
like
at
any
ballad
soirée
and
sweet
william
he
married
a
wife
jenny
cried
rose
marie
to
be
the
sweet
comfort
of
his
life
as
the
dew
flies
over
the
mulberry
tree
there
is
much
sense
to
it
she
observed
for
a
little
indignant
at
her
disparagement
of
such
noble
fragments
he
tramped
silently
back
and
forth
followed
by
a
cloud
of
smoke
from
the
cheroot
no
one
on
land
could
understand
the
absorbing
significance
of
every
detail
of
a
ship
life
only
gerrit
of
all
his
family
knew
the
chanteys
and
watches
the
anxiety
and
beauty
of
landfalls
the
blue
falklands
or
teneriffe
rising
above
the
clouds
the
hurried
making
and
taking
of
sail
in
the
squalls
of
the
doldrums
in
india
he
told
her
stopping
in
his
measured
course
female
children
are
given
to
the
crocodiles
her
mouth
parted
at
this
her
eyes
became
dilated
and
she
slipped
from
the
chair
that
perfectly
awfully
appalling
she
breathed
the
little
brown
girl
babies
oh
father
she
cried
as
william
ammidon
came
into
the
library
what
do
you
suppose
grandfather
says
that
in
india
female
children
are
crocodiles
words
failed
her
what
the
sense
in
frightening
the
child
father
william
remonstrated
i
wish
you
would
keep
those
horrors
for
the
old
heathen
of
the
marine
society
jeremy
had
a
lively
sense
of
guilt
he
had
been
betrayed
by
confounded
airs
and
pretensions
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
telling
the
girl
such
things
the
british
government
is
putting
a
stop
to
that
he
added
hastily
and
to
suttees
what
are
they
she
inquired
never
mind
camilla
her
father
interposed
go
up
with
your
mother
and
sisters
i
suppose
it
no
good
speaking
to
you
william
continued
but
my
family
is
not
a
crew
and
this
house
is
the
you
might
make
some
effort
to
realize
you
on
land
i
know
i
on
land
william
tell
that
any
day
from
a
sight
of
you
you
can
afford
to
listen
a
little
now
and
then
about
the
sea
that
where
all
you
have
came
from
it
the
same
with
near
everybody
in
salem
vessels
brought
them
and
vessels
kept
them
going
and
with
the
wharves
as
empty
as
they
were
this
afternoon
soon
there
wo
be
any
salem
to
talk
about
the
tide
turned
from
here
the
other
replied
with
the
increase
in
tonnage
and
the
importance
of
time
we
need
the
railway
and
docking
facility
of
the
larger
cities
boston
and
new
york
it
running
out
fast
enough
jeremy
agreed
and
there
a
lot
going
out
with
it
you
never
see
again
like
the
men
who
put
a
reef
in
england
in
you
are
always
sounding
the
same
strings
we
at
peace
with
the
world
now
and
a
good
thing
for
shipping
peace
the
elder
declared
hotly
you
and
the
democrats
may
call
it
that
but
it
a
damned
swindle
with
the
british
to
windward
of
you
and
hardly
a
sail
now
drawing
in
your
ropes
what
did
edmund
burke
tell
parliament
in
about
our
whalers
hey
why
that
from
davis
strait
to
the
antipodes
from
the
falklands
to
africa
we
outdrove
holland
france
and
england
after
the
laws
and
bounties
congress
passed
in
what
could
you
see
something
like
a
half
million
tonnage
gained
in
three
years
or
so
in
the
war
of
your
land
soldiers
were
a
pretty
show
with
the
capitol
burning
but
when
it
was
finished
the
privateers
had
sunk
over
nine
million
dollars
of
british
shipping
to
their
sixty
thousand
the
chesapeake
luggers
have
gone
out
with
the
tide
too
and
then
by
god
by
god
what
then
the
treaty
of
ghent
with
england
impressing
our
seamen
and
tying
our
ships
up
in
what
ports
she
chose
under
a
right
of
search
on
top
of
this
your
commissioners
repeal
the
ship
laws
and
the
british
allow
you
to
carry
only
native
cargoes
to
the
united
kingdom
with
a
part
of
the
customs
and
harbor
dues
off
but
in
spite
of
congress
and
political
sharks
we
went
out
to
india
and
china
direct
with
home
from
calcutta
in
days
and
the
east
indiamen
six
or
seven
months
on
the
shorter
run
to
england
i
can
show
you
what
the
london
said
about
that
it
in
my
desk
years
of
peace
and
the
shipping
interest
is
half
ruined
thousands
of
our
manufactures
are
seeking
redemption
in
foreign
lands
it
goes
on
to
tell
that
american
seamen
already
controlled
an
important
part
of
the
british
carrying
trade
to
the
east
indies
yet
your
precious
lawmakers
open
our
west
india
trade
to
great
britain
but
they
would
ask
the
privilege
to
carry
a
cargo
from
british
india
to
liverpool
or
canada
now
father
william
put
in
you
are
getting
excited
again
it
good
for
you
we
are
not
all
such
fools
as
you
make
out
look
at
the
masters
themselves
jeremy
continued
explosively
gentlemen
like
gerrit
from
harvard
university
and
not
beating
their
way
aft
with
a
belaying
pin
they
could
sail
a
ship
with
the
crew
of
a
britisher
with
her
clumsy
yellow
hemp
sails
and
belly
you
could
lose
a
dinghy
in
mind
i
do
say
the
english
handy
in
a
ship
and
that
they
would
clew
up
a
topsail
clean
at
the
edge
of
hell
what
we
are
on
the
seas
came
over
from
them
but
we
bettered
it
william
and
they
knew
it
and
naturally
enough
laid
out
to
sail
around
us
i
do
blame
england
but
i
do
our
god
damn
father
the
other
firmly
interrupted
you
are
shouting
as
if
you
were
on
the
in
a
gale
i
must
insist
on
your
quieting
down
you
burst
a
blood
vessel
maybe
i
am
jeremy
muttered
and
it
would
matter
much
if
i
did
when
i
see
a
nation
with
shipmasters
who
would
set
their
royals
when
others
hove
too
and
get
there
all
snarled
up
with
shore
lines
and
political
duffel
i
nigh
ready
to
burst
something
rhoda
said
that
you
were
at
the
dunsacks
this
afternoon
i
saw
edward
in
boston
yesterday
i
do
care
if
you
saw
the
flying
dutchman
the
other
asserted
breathing
stormily
it
curious
about
the
china
service
william
went
on
anyone
out
there
for
a
number
of
years
gets
to
look
chinese
edward
is
as
yellow
as
a
lemon
but
nothing
like
as
pleasant
a
color
thin
too
and
nervous
hands
crawling
all
over
themselves
never
still
for
a
moment
he
say
why
he
had
left
heard
and
company
and
i
did
quite
like
to
ask
edward
came
on
from
england
in
the
of
the
west
the
swallow
tail
line
i
did
ask
him
if
he
were
going
to
settle
in
salem
but
he
say
there
was
something
about
a
boston
house
it
seems
that
gerrit
carried
his
chest
and
things
from
canton
in
the
as
an
accommodation
suddenly
jeremy
felt
very
insecure
his
body
heavy
and
knees
weak
failing
he
stumbled
back
into
the
chair
by
the
fireplace
william
at
his
side
you
must
pay
some
attention
to
what
you
told
father
the
latter
said
anxiously
how
are
you
now
i
all
right
he
declared
testily
trying
to
brush
away
the
dimness
floating
before
his
eyes
shall
i
help
you
up
to
bed
i
go
to
bed
when
i
a
mind
to
jeremy
retorted
i
am
not
under
cover
yet
by
a
long
reach
to
establish
his
he
rose
and
moved
to
the
secretary
where
he
got
a
fresh
cheroot
and
lighted
it
with
slightly
trembling
fingers
he
grumbled
inarticulately
remembering
his
own
exploits
in
the
carrying
of
sail
and
record
runs
under
the
bluff
bows
of
the
honorable
john
company
itself
the
ebb
tide
he
thought
returning
to
william
figure
and
its
amplification
by
himself
so
much
that
had
been
good
sweeping
out
to
sea
never
to
return
long
overdue
once
more
he
shook
himself
free
of
numbing
dread
automatically
he
had
fallen
back
into
the
passage
from
the
secretary
to
the
hall
door
he
saw
that
he
had
worn
threadbare
a
narrow
strip
where
his
feet
had
so
often
pressed
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
see
about
a
fresh
case
of
cheroots
soon
primes
too
they
need
try
to
put
him
off
with
the
second
quality
he
was
put
off
a
great
deal
lately
people
pretended
to
be
listening
to
him
and
all
the
time
their
thoughts
were
somewhere
else
either
that
or
they
were
merely
politely
concealing
the
opinion
that
he
was
out
of
date
of
no
importance
his
family
were
always
providing
against
his
fatigue
or
excitement
at
the
countinghouse
the
gravest
problems
he
was
certain
were
withheld
from
him
at
the
occurrence
of
this
possibility
a
fresh
indignation
poured
through
his
brain
fuming
and
tramping
up
and
down
he
determined
that
he
would
show
any
of
the
clerks
who
did
attend
to
his
wishes
or
counsel
that
he
was
still
senior
partner
of
ammidon
ammidon
and
saltonstone
iii
the
evening
was
surprisingly
warm
and
still
with
an
intermittent
falling
of
rain
and
the
windows
were
open
in
the
room
where
rhoda
ammidon
sat
regarding
half
dismayed
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
of
a
dressing
table
a
few
minutes
before
she
had
discovered
her
first
gray
hair
it
was
not
only
the
mere
assault
upon
her
vanity
but
too
a
realization
far
deeper
here
was
the
stamp
of
time
the
mark
of
a
considerable
progress
toward
the
end
itself
her
emotions
were
various
but
curiously
enough
almost
the
first
had
been
a
wave
of
passionate
tenderness
for
william
and
her
little
girls
the
shock
of
finding
that
arresting
sign
was
now
giving
place
to
a
purely
feminine
reaction
she
considered
for
a
moment
the
purchase
of
a
bottle
of
hair
coloring
then
with
a
disdainful
gesture
dismissed
such
a
temporary
and
troublesome
measure
she
kept
an
undiminishing
pride
in
her
appearance
and
a
relentless
care
and
choice
in
the
details
of
her
dress
pleased
by
the
knowledge
that
the
attention
men
paid
her
showed
no
indication
yet
of
growing
perfunctory
she
had
been
much
admired
both
in
boston
and
london
through
her
youth
and
she
recalled
her
early
doubts
at
the
prospect
of
life
in
salem
but
she
realized
now
that
as
her
years
and
children
multiplied
she
was
by
imperceptible
degrees
returning
to
a
traditional
new
england
heritage
she
was
glad
however
that
william
wide
connections
lifted
him
above
a
purely
local
view
william
was
really
a
splendid
husband
rhoda
was
conscious
of
this
together
with
a
clear
recognition
of
his
faults
and
quite
aside
from
both
existed
her
unreasoning
affection
the
latter
vividly
dominated
her
shut
out
on
any
occasion
of
stress
all
else
but
for
the
most
part
she
held
him
in
an
attitude
of
mildly
amused
comprehension
gerrit
ammidon
she
had
seen
until
after
her
engagement
to
william
and
she
sometimes
thought
of
the
former
in
connection
with
marriage
gerrit
she
admitted
to
herself
was
a
far
more
romantic
figure
than
william
not
handsomer
william
ammidon
was
very
good
looking
but
more
arresting
with
his
hair
swinging
about
his
ears
and
intense
blue
gaze
an
exciting
man
she
decided
again
for
whom
one
would
eternally
put
on
the
loveliest
clothes
possible
a
man
to
make
you
almost
as
ravishingly
happy
as
miserable
and
therefore
disturbing
as
a
husband
at
this
her
mind
returned
to
her
gray
hair
and
the
fact
that
the
metal
backlog
of
the
kitchen
fire
which
supplied
the
house
with
hot
water
had
been
leaking
over
the
hearth
a
feeling
of
melancholy
possessed
her
at
the
turning
of
younger
visions
into
commonplace
necessities
but
she
dismissed
it
with
the
shadow
of
a
smile
it
was
absurd
for
a
woman
of
her
age
to
dwell
on
such
frivolous
things
yet
she
still
lingered
to
wonder
if
men
too
kept
intact
among
their
memories
the
radiant
image
of
their
youth
if
they
ever
thought
of
it
with
tenderness
and
extenuation
she
decided
in
the
negative
convinced
that
men
even
at
the
end
of
many
years
never
definitely
lost
connection
with
their
early
selves
there
was
always
a
trace
of
hopefulness
of
jaunty
vanity
sometimes
winning
and
sometimes
merely
ridiculous
attached
to
their
decline
rhoda
stirred
and
moved
to
a
window
gazing
vaguely
out
into
the
moist
blue
obscurity
sidsall
she
realized
was
maturing
with
a
disconcerting
rapidity
depths
were
opening
in
the
girl
being
at
which
she
her
mother
could
only
guess
it
was
exactly
as
if
a
crystal
through
and
through
which
she
had
gazed
had
suddenly
been
veiled
by
rosy
clouds
sidsall
had
a
charming
nature
direct
and
unsuspicious
and
generously
courageous
there
was
a
sound
at
the
door
and
william
entered
patently
ruffled
it
was
clear
that
he
had
had
another
disagreement
with
his
father
shameful
how
you
disturb
him
she
declared
look
here
rhoda
he
replied
vigorously
i
wo
continually
be
put
in
the
wrong
it
seems
as
if
i
had
no
affection
for
the
old
gentleman
i
always
have
the
difficult
thing
to
do
and
he
has
been
slightly
contemptuous
ever
since
i
was
a
boy
because
i
did
go
to
sea
the
truth
is
while
i
would
think
of
letting
him
know
he
a
tremendous
nuisance
pottering
about
the
countingrooms
with
his
stories
of
antediluvian
trading
voyages
and
worse
is
to
come
these
new
clipper
ships
and
passages
have
knocked
the
wind
out
of
the
old
slow
vessels
we
have
about
determined
to
reorganize
our
fleet
entirely
and
are
in
treaty
with
donald
mckay
for
an
extreme
clipper
type
of
twelve
hundred
tons
of
course
he
my
parent
but
i
wonder
at
saltonstone
patience
father
wo
hear
of
the
opium
trade
and
it
turning
over
thousand
per
cent
profits
we
are
privately
operating
two
fast
topsail
schooners
in
india
now
but
it
both
inconvenient
and
a
risk
they
ought
to
be
put
right
under
our
house
flag
for
credit
alone
it
is
all
bound
to
come
up
and
then
he
go
off
like
a
cannon
could
you
wait
till
he
dead
william
she
asked
it
wo
be
a
great
while
now
i
can
see
that
he
has
failed
dreadfully
from
this
worry
about
gerrit
five
years
will
make
all
the
difference
we
are
losing
tea
cargoes
every
month
to
these
ships
making
sensational
runs
i
do
talk
much
rhoda
about
well
my
family
but
i
am
as
upset
over
gerrit
as
anyone
else
except
for
a
tendency
to
carry
too
much
sail
there
not
a
better
shipmaster
out
of
new
england
not
only
that
he
my
brother
easy
to
like
gerrit
his
opinions
are
a
little
wild
and
an
exaggerated
sense
of
justice
gets
him
into
absurd
situations
yet
his
motives
are
the
purest
possible
perhaps
that
word
pure
describes
him
better
than
any
other
however
people
who
did
know
might
smile
as
a
man
rhoda
i
can
assert
that
he
is
surprisingly
that
a
wonderful
quality
she
agreed
why
anyone
should
smile
is
beyond
me
william
would
you
know
that
my
hair
is
turning
gray
do
i
look
a
lot
older
than
i
did
five
years
ago
he
studied
her
complacently
you
hardly
changed
since
i
married
you
he
asserted
a
great
deal
prettier
than
these
young
cramped
figgers
i
see
about
the
girls
too
are
just
like
you
good
armfuls
all
of
them
the
next
day
was
flawlessly
sunny
the
slightly
stirring
air
reminiscent
of
the
sea
and
the
lilacs
everywhere
were
masses
of
purple
and
white
bloom
stepping
down
from
her
carriage
on
the
morning
round
of
shopping
rhoda
encountered
nettie
vollar
leaving
one
of
the
stores
of
cheapside
why
nettie
she
exclaimed
kindly
it
been
the
longest
time
since
i
seen
you
it
is
just
no
use
asking
you
to
the
house
and
it
seems
with
nothing
to
do
i
never
have
a
minute
for
the
visits
i
like
to
make
nettie
she
thought
was
a
striking
girl
no
woman
with
her
stack
of
black
hair
dark
sparkling
eyes
and
red
spot
on
either
cheek
more
fetching
in
profile
than
full
face
her
nose
had
a
pert
angle
and
her
cleft
chin
was
enticingly
rounded
later
she
would
be
too
fat
but
now
her
body
was
ripely
perfect
i
do
go
anywhere
much
she
responded
in
a
voice
faintly
and
instinctively
antagonistic
i
do
like
kindness
in
people
but
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
contented
that
all
i
probably
ever
get
from
anybody
who
is
a
thing
in
the
world
ammidon
she
hesitated
then
continued
more
rapidly
her
gaze
lowered
have
you
had
any
word
about
captain
ammidon
yet
have
they
given
up
hope
of
the
we
had
no
news
rhoda
told
her
and
then
she
added
her
conviction
that
gerrit
would
return
safely
he
was
better
than
kind
nettie
vollar
said
i
sure
he
liked
me
ammidon
or
he
would
have
if
everything
had
been
spoiled
by
grandfather
he
thinks
i
a
dreadful
sin
you
know
a
punishment
on
mother
but
inside
of
me
i
do
feel
different
from
others
sometimes
i
i
wonder
that
i
do
actually
go
sinful
i
had
opportunities
and
being
good
has
offered
me
much
has
it
you
are
naturally
a
good
girl
nettie
rhoda
answered
simply
but
you
must
be
braver
than
ordinary
if
we
think
differently
from
salem
still
it
is
in
salem
we
must
live
i
keep
many
of
my
beliefs
secret
just
as
you
must
control
most
of
your
feelings
the
other
responded
with
a
hard
little
laugh
thank
you
though
you
are
more
like
gerrit
captain
ammidon
than
saltonstone
his
own
sister
i
hate
her
she
declared
i
hate
all
the
salem
women
so
superior
and
condescending
and
christian
they
always
have
a
silly
look
of
wonder
at
their
charity
in
speaking
to
me
when
they
do
they
act
as
if
it
just
a
privilege
for
me
to
be
in
their
church
i
rather
go
to
a
cotillion
at
hamilton
hall
any
day
of
course
you
would
rhoda
agreed
there
seemed
to
be
so
little
for
her
to
offer
or
say
that
she
was
relieved
when
they
parted
the
afternoon
grew
really
sultry
but
when
the
shadows
had
lengthened
she
encountered
jeremy
ammidon
wandering
aimlessly
about
the
hall
and
his
fine
palmetto
hat
and
wanghee
in
her
hand
urged
him
out
to
the
east
india
marine
society
it
much
too
beautiful
a
day
for
the
house
she
insisted
there
nothing
remarkable
about
it
he
returned
wind
too
light
and
variable
hardly
enough
to
hold
way
on
a
ship
there
were
the
stirring
strains
of
a
quickstep
without
at
the
door
they
saw
the
salem
cadets
preceded
by
flag
band
marching
in
columns
of
fours
into
washington
square
the
white
breeches
with
scarlet
coats
and
brass
buttons
made
a
gay
showing
on
the
green
common
the
sunlight
glittered
on
silver
braid
and
tassels
gilt
and
pompons
scaled
chin
straps
and
varnished
leather
the
old
man
face
grew
dark
at
the
brilliant
line
drawn
up
for
inspection
and
he
muttered
a
period
about
cursed
young
whigs
have
one
of
the
scoundrels
in
my
house
if
i
could
help
it
understand
william
he
too
damned
mild
for
my
idea
of
a
good
citizen
why
it
only
reasonable
that
a
country
got
to
be
run
like
a
ship
from
the
how
far
do
you
suppose
a
vessel
would
get
if
the
crew
hung
about
aft
and
chose
representatives
from
the
port
and
starboard
watches
and
galley
for
a
body
to
lay
the
course
and
make
sail
please
father
she
protested
laughing
do
go
along
into
the
sun
she
gently
pushed
him
toward
the
door
rhoda
realized
the
fact
that
william
was
more
than
half
whig
already
that
threatened
still
another
point
of
difference
of
departure
from
all
that
his
father
held
to
be
sacred
necessities
jeremy
like
most
of
the
older
shipmasters
was
a
bitter
federalist
an
upholder
of
a
strongly
centralized
autocratic
government
he
left
grumbling
and
the
staccato
commands
of
the
military
evolutions
on
the
common
rang
through
the
slumberous
afternoon
she
lingered
in
the
doorway
and
laurel
appeared
jigging
with
excitement
ca
i
get
nearer
she
begged
there
nothing
to
see
from
here
her
mother
replied
ask
camilla
to
take
you
over
to
the
square
camilla
appeared
indifferently
i
do
know
why
anyone
should
be
flustered
she
observed
it
is
like
the
fourth
of
july
with
a
concert
and
fireworks
as
they
were
going
sidsall
came
out
in
a
white
tarlatan
dress
worked
with
sprays
of
yellow
barley
her
face
glowing
with
color
and
sat
on
the
steps
positively
her
mother
said
looking
down
on
the
mass
of
bright
chestnut
hair
in
a
chenille
net
we
soon
have
to
have
you
up
in
braids
i
wish
i
might
she
responded
and
hodie
is
too
silly
i
get
her
to
lace
me
tightly
enough
she
says
such
things
are
engines
of
the
devil
it
still
a
little
soon
for
that
rhoda
broke
off
as
a
slight
erect
man
at
the
verge
of
middle
age
turned
in
from
pleasant
street
upon
them
roger
she
said
cordially
as
he
came
quickly
up
the
steps
he
greeted
her
lightly
and
bent
over
sidsall
with
an
extended
hand
the
apple
blossoms
i
see
are
here
rhoda
wondered
what
nonsense
roger
brevard
was
repeating
sidsall
face
was
hidden
from
view
but
then
roger
was
always
like
that
his
manner
was
never
at
a
loss
for
the
appropriate
gesture
he
had
a
great
many
points
in
common
with
her
she
thought
neither
had
been
born
in
salem
and
his
rightful
setting
was
in
the
best
metropolitan
he
had
been
here
for
a
dozen
years
now
in
charge
of
the
local
affairs
of
the
mongolian
marine
insurance
company
and
she
often
wondered
why
a
member
of
a
family
socially
notable
in
new
york
he
continued
in
a
city
a
position
of
comparative
unimportance
she
was
she
said
going
back
to
the
lawn
the
glare
of
pleasant
street
was
fatiguing
and
she
proceeded
through
the
house
with
the
surety
of
his
following
but
on
the
emerald
sod
there
was
no
sign
of
him
and
she
found
a
seat
in
a
basket
chair
by
the
willow
tree
beyond
she
waited
for
roger
with
a
small
but
growing
impatience
he
must
be
done
immediately
with
whatever
he
might
say
to
sidsall
and
she
wished
to
discuss
the
possibilities
of
a
rumor
that
president
polk
intended
to
visit
salem
there
would
be
a
collation
perhaps
a
military
ball
to
arrange
franklin
hall
would
be
the
better
place
for
the
latter
she
heard
a
faint
silvery
echo
of
laughter
sidsall
it
was
extremely
nice
of
course
in
roger
brevard
to
entertain
her
daughter
though
she
care
to
have
the
child
give
the
effect
of
receiving
men
yet
it
was
finally
sidsall
who
appeared
unaccompanied
in
the
window
she
came
forward
to
where
rhoda
sat
her
face
still
stirred
with
amusement
brevard
went
on
she
said
in
response
to
her
look
of
inquiry
that
rather
odd
the
latter
commented
almost
sharply
he
had
only
a
few
minutes
the
girl
explained
she
sank
into
a
seat
and
mood
of
abstraction
rhoda
studied
her
with
a
veiled
glance
hers
were
exceptional
children
they
had
given
her
scarcely
an
concern
and
she
must
see
that
in
the
unsettling
period
which
sidsall
was
now
entering
she
was
not
spoiled
perhaps
laurel
entertained
her
more
than
the
others
she
was
a
very
normal
little
girl
not
thoughtful
like
janet
and
without
exaggerated
poise
but
she
had
a
picturesque
imagination
and
her
companionship
with
her
grandfather
was
delightful
the
latter
addressed
her
quite
as
if
she
were
a
fellow
shipmaster
and
she
had
acquired
some
remarkable
sea
expressions
some
deplorable
and
others
enigmatic
only
questioned
about
the
order
of
her
room
she
had
said
that
it
was
all
square
by
the
lifts
and
braces
for
this
her
grandfather
had
given
her
a
gold
piece
there
was
she
knew
an
excellent
school
for
older
girls
at
lausanne
and
revolving
the
possibility
of
obtaining
for
sidsall
some
of
the
european
advantages
she
rhoda
had
enjoyed
the
following
afternoon
she
drove
to
the
cliffords
on
marlboro
street
for
a
consultation
with
madra
who
had
spent
a
number
of
seasons
on
lake
leman
in
a
cool
parlor
with
yellow
tibet
rugs
and
maroon
hangings
she
had
tea
while
madra
clifford
thin
and
imperious
with
a
settled
ill
health
like
white
powder
and
a
priceless
risajii
shawl
conversed
in
a
shrill
key
caroline
has
been
in
bed
for
a
week
that
vulgar
fisk
with
his
elbow
in
her
bosom
tried
five
times
to
extract
her
tooth
and
then
broke
it
to
the
roots
i
hear
there
is
a
galvanic
ring
for
rheumatism
the
pain
in
my
joints
is
excruciating
i
have
an
idea
my
bones
are
changing
into
chalk
the
right
knee
will
hardly
bend
the
darkly
colored
shawl
with
its
border
of
cypress
intensified
her
sunken
temples
and
the
pallid
lips
she
developed
the
subject
of
her
indisposition
sparing
no
detail
while
rhoda
ammidon
from
her
superabundance
of
half
pitied
the
other
and
was
half
revolted
at
the
mind
touched
too
by
bodily
ill
the
fortune
accumulated
by
the
hardy
clifford
men
flogged
out
of
crews
and
stained
by
the
blood
of
primitive
and
dull
savages
the
cliffords
were
notorious
for
their
brutal
driving
now
served
only
to
support
madra
debility
and
a
horde
of
unscrupulous
panderers
to
her
obsession
edward
dunsack
is
in
salem
she
continued
and
i
heard
he
has
the
most
peculiar
appearance
very
probably
the
result
of
the
unmentionable
practices
of
the
orient
father
liked
the
chinese
though
so
many
of
our
shipmasters
have
and
not
always
the
merchants
what
was
i
saying
oh
yes
edward
dunsack
i
understand
you
had
a
distinct
alarm
in
that
quarter
about
the
girl
and
gerrit
ammidon
but
i
forgot
to
say
how
glad
i
am
about
gerrit
you
must
have
been
horribly
worried
what
do
you
mean
rhoda
demanded
why
have
you
heard
the
nautilus
was
sighted
news
came
from
boston
she
ought
to
be
i
believe
i
suppose
william
has
been
too
concerned
to
get
you
word
at
home
rhoda
ammidon
rose
immediately
surprised
at
the
force
of
the
emotion
that
blurred
her
eyes
with
tears
gerrit
was
safe
possibly
they
had
been
told
at
java
head
now
but
she
must
be
there
with
jeremy
ammidon
surprises
even
as
joyful
as
this
were
a
great
strain
on
him
neglecting
the
object
of
her
visit
she
returned
at
once
to
pleasant
street
urging
the
coachman
to
an
undignified
haste
and
keeping
the
carriage
at
the
door
her
was
at
his
secretary
in
the
library
and
it
was
evident
that
he
had
heard
nothing
of
his
son
return
well
rhoda
he
said
swinging
about
what
a
bright
cheek
you
have
like
laurel
i
feel
bright
father
she
replied
with
a
nod
and
smile
after
this
none
of
you
will
be
able
to
laugh
at
my
predictions
you
see
a
feeling
is
often
more
correct
than
masculine
judgment
his
momentary
bewilderment
gave
place
to
a
painfully
strained
interrogation
yes
she
told
him
but
we
are
none
of
us
surprised
gerrit
is
almost
in
salem
harbor
she
moved
near
him
and
with
a
veiled
anxiety
laid
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
a
splendid
sailor
he
muttered
it
seemed
as
if
rhoda
could
really
hear
the
dull
rising
pounding
of
his
shaken
heart
but
his
excitement
subsided
gave
way
to
a
normal
concern
a
flood
of
vain
questions
and
preparation
to
go
down
to
the
wharf
in
the
midst
of
this
a
message
came
from
the
countinghouse
of
ammidon
ammidon
and
saltonstone
that
the
would
dock
within
an
hour
a
small
crowd
had
already
gathered
on
derby
wharf
when
rhoda
and
her
companion
made
their
way
past
the
warehouses
built
at
intervals
along
the
wharf
to
the
place
where
the
would
be
warped
in
the
wharfinger
saluted
them
william
ammidon
joined
his
wife
and
beyond
she
could
see
james
saltonstone
conversing
with
the
surveyor
of
the
port
the
afternoon
was
serene
a
faint
air
drew
in
from
the
sea
and
with
it
sweeping
slowly
inside
peach
point
was
the
tall
ship
with
her
canvas
towering
gold
in
the
western
sun
against
the
distance
of
sea
and
sky
as
rhoda
watched
she
saw
their
house
flag
a
white
field
checkered
in
blue
fluttering
from
the
main
royal
truck
the
royals
are
coming
in
jeremy
ammidon
exclaimed
gripping
arm
he
is
lowering
his
yards
and
hauling
up
the
courses
my
dear
there
nothing
on
god
earth
finer
than
a
ship
the
slipped
along
surprisingly
fast
rhoda
could
now
see
the
crew
moving
about
and
coiling
the
gear
look
father
there
gerrit
on
the
the
shipmaster
shorter
than
common
with
broad
assertive
shoulders
in
formal
black
was
easily
recognizable
a
woman
with
a
worn
flushed
face
pressed
by
jeremy
andrew
there
too
she
told
them
broadrick
the
mate
the
ship
moved
more
slowly
under
her
topsails
and
jibs
in
a
soundless
progress
with
the
ripples
falling
away
in
water
like
dark
green
glass
liquid
and
still
she
was
now
but
a
short
distance
from
the
end
of
the
wharf
broadrick
was
forward
between
the
knightheads
with
the
crew
ranged
to
the
starboard
and
at
the
braces
while
gerrit
ammidon
stood
with
one
hand
on
the
railing
and
the
other
holding
a
brass
speaking
trumpet
to
his
lips
let
go
your
port

and
after

broadrick
brace
the
fore
and
mizzen
yards
sharp
up
leave
the
main

fast
and
lay
the
main
topsail
to
the
mast
as
she
comes
to
the
wind

the

run
down
he
turned
to
the

a

sir
the
ship
answered
quickly
and
rounded
to
while
her
weather
fore
and
mizzen
yards
flew
forward
until
they
touched
the
starboard
backstays
and
the
men
hauled
in
the
slack
of
the
braces
with
the
main
yard
square
to
check
her
way
the
jibs
drooped
down
along
the
stays
broadrick
you
may
let
go
the
starboard
anchor
and
furl

the
mate
grasped
a
top
maul
and
struck
the
trigger
of
the
ring
stopper
a
clean
blow
the
anchor
splashed
into
the
water
with
a
rumbling
cable
and
the
was
home
gerrit
ammidon
walked
hurriedly
to
the
companionway
and
went
below
while
the
mate
continued
stand
by
to
let
go
your
topsail
halliards
and
man
the

sharper
with

sheets
and
unbend

the

in

at
a
rhythmic
shout
the
bunts
of
the
three
topsails
came
up
together
the
wind
had
died
away
and
the
flags
hung
listlessly
from
the
main
truck
and
spanker
gaff
the
water
of
the
harbor
was
unstirred
except
for
the
swirls
at
the
oar
blades
of
an
incoming
quarter
boat
and
the
warp
paying
out
at
her

the
voice
of
the

chantey
of
the
crew

at
the

to

subdued
the
times

low
oh
leave

johnny
leave
her
i
guess
it
time
for
us
to
go
oh
leave

johnny
leave
her
i
thought
i
heard
the
old
man
say
oh
leave

johnny
leave
her
we
will
get
our
pay
her
rhoda
ammidon
discovered
herself
leaning
forward
tensely
her
hands
shut
in
excitement
and
emotion
and
she
relaxed
with
a
happy
laugh
as
the
with
her
yards
exactly
square
and
rigging
taut
her
sides
and
figurehead
and
ports
bright
with
newly
laid
on
paint
moved
to
the
wharf
it
seemed
to
her
that
gerrit
descending
a
short
stage
from
the
deck
looked
markedly
older
than
when
he
had
last
sailed
yet
he
had
a
surprisingly
youthful
air
still
partly
she
thought
from
the
manner
in
which
he
wore
his
hair
falling
in
a
waving
thick
line
about
his
cheeks
his
mouth
was
at
once
fresh
and
severe
his
face
clean
shaven
and
his
eyes
if
possible
more
directly
blue
than
ever
i
take
the
ship
manifest
to
the
collector
he
said
greeting
them
and
impatiently
waving
aside
the
vendors
after
the
cook
slush
the
excited
women
and
runners
and
human
miscellany
crowding
forward
then
java
head
he
paused
speaking
over
his
shoulder
i
be
thankful
if
you
would
send
the
barouche
down
in
an
hour
or
so
driving
back
her
hand
on
jeremy
ammidon
knee
rhoda
wondered
at
gerrit
request
it
was
entirely
unlike
him
to
ride
in
the
barouche
rather
he
had
always
derided
it
in
the
terms
of
his
calling
however
unable
to
find
a
solution
for
her
surprise
she
listened
to
the
comments
and
speculations
i
suppose
william
first
question
will
be
about
the
cargo
and
of
course
i
hope
the
ship
has
done
well
but
i
just
glad
to
have
gerrit
back
i
am
for
a
fact
rhoda
we
all
are
she
assured
him
and
william
as
happy
as
any
you
be
misled
by
his
manner
father
i
hope
the
supper
will
be
good
and
please
you
gerrit
will
be
satisfied
with
anything
he
chuckled
probably
been
out
of
beans
even
for
a
month
did
you
notice
that
mast
and
yard
they
were
rigged
at
sea
gerrit
carried
them
away
it
hurts
him
to
take
in
a
sail
some
day
i
tell
him
he
drag
the
spars
out
of
his
ship
his
confounded
pride
will
founder
him
he
made
these
charges
lightly
with
a
palpable
underlying
pride
and
rhoda
knew
would
permit
no
one
else
to
criticize
his
son
she
found
her
daughters
in
a
state
of
gala
excitement
on
the
front
steps
uncle
gerrit
in
the
laurel
chanted
and
it
was
evident
that
camilla
herself
was
thrilled
they
all
went
up
to
put
on
holiday
dress
rhoda
turned
to
the
coachman
have
the
barouche
at
the
head
of
derby
wharf
in
an
hour
gerrit
unusual
demand
again
puzzled
her
a
fantastic
possibility
lodged
in
her
brain
perhaps
he
was
not
alone
she
pulled
the
bell
rope
for
her
maid
changed
into
black
moiré
with
cut
steel
bretelles
and
selected
the
peacock
coloring
of
a
shawl
she
found
her
husband
with
his
father
in
the
library
i
understand
it
a
splendid
cargo
william
remarked
jeremy
nodded
triumphantly
at
her
and
she
expressed
a
half
humorous
resentment
at
this
mercenary
display
he
ought
to
be
here
the
younger
man
declared
consulting
his
watch
as
he
spoke
rhoda
saw
the
barouche
draw
up
before
the
house
she
had
a
glimpse
of
a
figure
at
gerrit
ammidon
side
in
extravagantly
brilliant
satins
there
was
a
sibilant
whisper
of
rich
materials
in
the
hall
and
the
master
entered
the
library
with
a
pale
set
face
father
he
said
rhoda
and
william
allow
me
my
wife
taou
yuen
rhoda
ammidon
gave
an
uncontrollable
gasp
as
the
chinese
woman
sank
in
a
fluttering
prostration
of
color
at
jeremy
feet
he
ejaculated
god
bless
me
and
started
back
william
face
was
inscrutable
unguessed
lines
appeared
about
his
severe
mouth
her
own
sensation
was
one
of
incredulity
touched
with
mounting
anger
and
feeling
of
outrage
the
woman
rose
but
only
to
sink
again
before
william
she
was
on
her
knees
and
supported
by
her
hands
bent
forward
and
touched
her
forehead
to
the
floor
three
times
gerrit
laughed
shortly
she
was
to
shake
your
hands
we
went
over
and
over
it
on
shipboard
but
anything
less
than
the
was
too
casual
for
her
she
was
now
erect
with
a
freer
murmur
of
greeting
to
rhoda
the
latter
was
instantly
aware
of
one
certainty
chinese
she
might
be
she
was
but
no
less
absolutely
aristocratic
her
face
oval
and
slightly
flat
was
plastered
with
paint
on
paint
but
her
gesture
the
calm
scrutiny
of
enigmatic
black
eyes
under
delicately
arched
brows
exquisite
quiet
hands
were
all
under
the
most
admirable
instinctive
command
rhoda
said
i
see
that
i
am
to
welcome
you
for
gerrit
family
the
other
in
slow
lisping
english
replied
thank
you
greatly
i
am
humbled
to
the
earth
before
your
goodness
you
will
want
to
go
to
your
room
rhoda
continued
mechanically
it
was
only
prepared
for
one
but
i
send
a
servant
up
at
once
she
was
enraged
at
the
silent
stupidity
of
the
three
men
and
flashed
a
silent
command
at
her
husband
this
is
a
decided
surprise
the
latter
at
last
addressed
his
brother
nor
can
i
pretend
that
it
is
pleasant
jeremy
ammidon
gaze
wandered
blankly
from
gerrit
to
the
woman
then
back
to
his
son
never
before
had
rhoda
seen
such
lovely
clothes
a
long
gown
with
wide
sleeves
of
satin
embroidered
in
flower
petals
and
innumerable
minute
sapphire
and
orange
butterflies
a
short
sleeveless
jacket
of
sage
green
caught
with
looped
red
jade
buttons
and
threaded
with
silver
and
indigo
slippers
crusted
and
tasseled
with
pearls
her
hair
rose
from
the
back
in
a
smooth
burnished
loop
there
were
long
pins
of
pink
jade
carved
into
blossoms
a
quivering
decoration
of
gold
leaves
with
moonstones
in
glistening
drops
and
a
band
of
coral
lotus
buds
pierced
stone
bracelets
hung
about
her
delicate
wrists
fretted
crystal
balls
swung
from
the
lobes
of
her
ears
and
clasped
on
the
ends
of
several
fingers
were
long
pointed
filagrees
of
ivory
taou
yuen
gerrit
repeated
shortly
with
his
challenging
bright
gaze
that
means
peach
garden
my
wife
is
a
manchu
he
asserted
in
a
more
biting
tone
a
manchu
and
the
daughter
of
a
noble
thank
you
rhoda
particularly
but
i
have
always
counted
on
you
will
you
go
up
with
her
that
is
if
if
my
father
has
a
room
a
place
for
us
this
will
always
be
your
home
gerrit
jeremy
said
slowly
with
the
long
breath
of
a
diver
in
deep
waters
iv
in
the
room
that
had
been
his
since
early
maturity
gerrit
ammidon
gave
an
involuntary
sigh
of
relief
taou
yuen
his
wife
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
gazing
about
with
a
faint
and
polite
smile
her
eyes
rested
on
a
yellow
camphor
chest
one
of
the
set
brought
home
by
his
father
on
a
severe
high
range
of
drawers
made
of
sycamore
with
six
legs
on
her
brilliant
reflection
in
the
mirror
above
the
mantel
and
the
sleigh
bed
with
low
heavily
curved
ends
the
situation
below
however
brief
and
on
the
whole
reasonably
conducted
had
been
surprisingly
difficult
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
felt
no
necessity
to
apologize
for
his
marriage
he
had
known
that
taou
yuen
must
surprise
yes
shock
his
family
she
was
chinese
to
them
a
heathen
they
would
be
unable
to
comprehend
any
mitigating
dignity
of
rank
where
they
actually
suffer
he
realized
would
be
in
the
attitude
of
salem
the
stupid
gabble
the
censure
and
cold
pity
caused
by
his
wife
personally
he
regarded
these
with
the
contempt
he
felt
for
so
many
of
the
qualities
that
on
shore
bound
the
interests
of
everyone
into
a
single
common
concern
it
gave
him
pleasure
to
assault
the
authority
and
importance
of
such
public
prejudice
and
but
unavoidably
implicating
his
family
at
once
a
part
of
himself
and
salem
he
was
conscious
of
the
fact
that
he
had
laid
them
all
open
to
disagreeable
moments
he
was
sorry
for
this
and
his
regret
principally
materialized
by
his
father
hurt
confusion
had
unexpectedly
cast
a
shadow
on
a
scene
to
which
he
had
looked
forward
with
a
distinct
sense
of
comedy
where
the
realities
were
concerned
he
had
no
fear
of
taou
yuen
ability
to
justify
herself
completely
he
possessed
a
stupendous
admiration
for
her
he
watched
her
now
with
the
mingled
understanding
and
mystification
that
gave
his
life
with
her
such
a
decided
charm
her
gaze
had
fastened
on
the
above
the
drawers
she
must
be
wondering
if
she
would
have
to
paint
and
prepare
herself
for
him
here
openly
he
knew
that
she
considered
it
a
great
impropriety
for
her
face
to
be
seen
bare
all
the
elaborate
processes
of
her
morning
toilet
must
be
privately
conducted
he
recognized
this
but
had
no
idea
what
she
actually
thought
of
the
room
of
his
family
of
the
astonishing
situation
into
which
her
heart
had
betrayed
her
one
and
then
another
early
hope
he
saw
at
once
were
vain
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
in
america
in
salem
she
might
become
less
evidently
chinese
not
in
the
incongruous
horror
of
western
clothes
but
in
her
attitude
in
a
surrender
to
superficial
customs
he
had
pictured
her
as
merging
distinctively
into
the
local
scene
in
china
he
had
hoped
that
in
the
vicinity
of
washington
square
and
pleasant
street
she
would
appear
less
eastern
but
beyond
all
doubt
here
she
was
enormously
more
so
the
strange
repressed
surrounding
accentuated
every
detail
of
her
manchu
pomp
and
color
the
frank
splendor
of
her
satins
and
carved
jades
and
embroidery
her
immobile
striking
face
loaded
with
carmine
and
glinting
headdress
the
flawless
loveliness
of
hands
with
the
pointed
nail
protectors
were
in
his
room
infinitely
dramatized
the
other
less
secure
possibility
that
she
might
essentially
change
perished
silently
in
a
way
his
wish
had
been
a
presumption
that
a
member
of
the
oldest
and
most
subtle
civilization
existing
would
if
she
were
able
adopt
such
comparatively
crude
habits
of
life
and
thought
she
moved
slowly
up
to
the
bed
examining
it
curiously
and
again
he
understood
her
look
of
doubt
in
china
beds
were
called
or
stoves
from
the
fact
that
they
were
more
often
than
not
a
platform
of
brick
with
an
opening
beneath
for
hot
coals
she
fingered
the
ball
fringe
of
the
coverlet
and
then
turned
with
amazement
to
the
soft
pillow
a
hand
with
the
stone
bracelet
falling
back
from
her
smooth
wrist
rose
to
the
complicated
edifice
of
her
headdress
your
pillow
is
coming
along
from
the
ship
he
told
her
the
women
here
do
up
their
hair
every
morning
she
considered
this
with
geranium
lips
slightly
parted
on
flawless
teeth
and
nodded
slowly
the
westering
sun
striking
through
the
window
overlooking
the
common
illuminated
her
with
a
flat
gold
unreality
i
have
a
day
bed
brought
for
you
he
continued
realizing
that
as
the
result
of
fortunate
chance
she
understood
most
of
what
he
said
without
an
actual
command
of
the
individual
words
in
reply
she
sank
before
him
in
the
deep
manchu
gesture
with
one
knee
sweeping
the
floor
the
humility
of
her
posture
dignified
by
grace
he
touched
the
crystal
globe
of
an
earring
pinched
her
chin
in
the
half
light
manner
by
which
he
instinctively
expressed
his
affection
for
her
she
was
calm
and
pleased
taou
yuen
he
continued
you
miss
shanghai
with
the
wall
of
ten
gates
and
the
river
woosung
stuck
full
of
masts
you
never
think
salem
is
a
paradise
like
soochow
this
is
your
city
she
replied
slowly
choosing
the
words
your
ancestors
are
here
there
was
not
a
shade
of
regret
in
her
voice
or
manner
he
tried
once
more
and
as
vainly
as
ever
to
penetrate
the
veil
of
her
perfect
serenity
she
never
it
became
apparent
descended
from
the
most
inflexible
small
emotions
surface
gayety
of
mood
curiosity
the
faintest
possible
indication
of
contempt
he
had
learned
to
distinguish
the
fact
that
she
cared
enough
for
him
to
desert
every
familiar
circumstance
was
evident
but
beyond
these
he
was
powerless
to
reach
his
own
emotions
were
hardly
less
obscured
the
dominating
feeling
was
his
admiration
for
her
exquisite
worldly
wisdom
the
perfection
of
her
bodily
beauty
and
the
philosophy
which
bore
her
above
the
countless
trivialities
that
destroyed
the
dignity
of
western
minds
he
realized
that
her
paint
and
embroidery
covered
a
spirit
as
cold
and
tempered
as
fine
metal
she
was
totally
without
the
social
sentiment
of
his
own
world
but
she
was
equally
innocent
of
its
nauseous
hypocrisy
the
pretensions
of
a
piety
covering
commercial
dishonesty
obscenity
of
thought
and
spreading
scandal
the
injustice
he
saw
practiced
on
shore
had
always
turned
him
with
a
sense
of
relief
to
the
cleansing
challenge
of
the
sea
always
brought
in
contact
with
cunning
and
men
and
heartless
schemes
with
women
cheapened
by
a
conviction
of
the
indecency
of
life
he
was
in
a
state
of
hot
indignation
from
all
this
taou
yuen
offered
a
complete
escape
on
the
purely
feminine
side
she
was
a
constant
delight
the
last
possible
refinement
he
told
himself
of
instinct
and
effect
she
was
incapable
of
the
least
vulgarity
never
for
an
instant
did
she
flag
from
the
necessity
of
beauty
never
had
he
seen
her
too
weary
for
an
adornment
laborious
in
a
hundred
difficult
conventions
she
was
too
a
continuous
source
of
entertainment
even
as
his
wife
she
never
ceased
to
be
a
spectacle
his
consciousness
of
her
as
a
being
outside
himself
persisted
i
must
go
down
and
see
where
our
things
are
he
said
rising
in
the
hall
he
stopped
before
the
tall
clock
whose
striking
was
a
part
of
his
early
memories
below
the
house
seemed
empty
and
instead
of
turning
to
the
front
door
and
his
purpose
he
went
into
the
the
long
glass
doors
to
the
garden
were
open
and
the
interior
was
filled
with
the
scent
of
lilacs
the
room
itself
had
always
reminded
him
of
them
it
was
pale
in
color
cool
gilt
and
lavender
brocade
and
white
panels
nothing
had
been
moved
or
changed
the
inlaid
cylinder
fall
desk
with
its
garlands
of
painted
flowers
on
the
light
waxed
wood
stood
at
the
left
the
pole
screen
with
the
embroidered
bouquet
was
before
the
fire
blind
the
girandoles
scrolled
in
ormolu
and
hung
with
crystal
lusters
held
the
shimmer
of
golden
reflections
on
the
walls
he
had
remembered
the
at
java
head
as
a
place
of
enchanted
perfection
in
his
childhood
its
still
serenity
had
seemed
a
presentment
of
what
might
be
hoped
for
in
heaven
the
thought
of
the
room
as
it
was
now
open
but
a
little
dim
to
the
lilacs
and
warm
afternoon
had
haunted
him
as
the
measure
of
all
peace
and
serenity
in
moments
of
extreme
danger
his
ship
laboring
in
elemental
catastrophes
and
in
remote
seas
its
fragrance
had
touched
him
through
the
miasma
of
whampoa
reach
waiting
for
the
lighters
of
tea
to
float
down
from
canton
standing
off
in
the
thunder
squalls
of
the
night
for
the
morning
sea
breeze
to
take
him
into
rio
over
a
cognac
in
the
coffee
stalls
of
the
french
market
at
new
orleans
the
chanteys
ringing
from
the
cotton
gangs
along
the
levees
were
you
ever
down
in
mobile
bay
aye
aye
pump
away
as
he
left
the
room
he
saw
laurel
william
youngest
child
and
he
imprisoned
her
in
an
arm
you
have
asked
what
i
got
for
you
in
my
sea
chest
he
said
gerrit
was
very
fond
of
all
four
of
the
vigorous
girls
and
a
sense
of
injury
touched
him
at
laurel
reserved
manner
she
studied
him
with
a
wondering
uneasy
concern
this
he
realized
was
the
result
of
bring
home
taou
yuen
and
an
aggravated
impatience
a
growing
rebellion
seized
him
he
would
stay
with
his
wife
at
java
head
a
day
longer
than
necessary
and
if
anyone
in
his
family
or
outside
showed
the
slightest
disdain
he
could
retaliate
with
his
knowledge
of
local
pettiness
the
backbiting
enmities
and
secret
lapses
god
knew
he
did
want
trouble
all
he
asked
was
a
reasonable
liberty
the
semblance
anyhow
of
a
courtesy
toward
his
wife
whatever
might
be
said
would
be
of
no
moment
to
her
except
in
the
attitude
of
his
father
and
taou
yuen
indifference
furnished
a
splendid
example
for
himself
he
wondered
why
the
devil
he
was
continually
putting
his
fingers
in
affairs
that
could
concern
him
no
one
thanked
him
for
his
trouble
they
considered
him
something
of
a
fool
a
good
sailor
but
peculiar
the
damned
unexpected
twists
of
his
sense
of
the
absurd
too
got
him
into
constant
difficulty
his
father
was
standing
outside
the
principal
entrance
and
as
he
joined
him
on
the
steps
he
saw
two
men
from
the
carrying
his
desk
by
the
beckets
let
in
the
ends
the
wind
was
blowing
gently
up
pleasant
street
the
men
at
his
gesture
lifted
their
burden
up
the
steps
between
the
direction
of
the
wind
and
jeremy
ammidon
the
latter
rose
instantly
into
one
of
his
dark
rages
what
do
you
mean
you
damned
packetrats
coming
up
a
companionway
to
the
windward
of
me
i
have
no
whalers
habits
here
he
repeated
discontentedly
that
everything
on
sea
and
land
had
fallen
into
a
decline
others
followed
with
a
number
of
korean
boxes
strapped
and
locked
with
copper
and
wicker
baskets
a
man
in
charge
said
to
gerrit
ammidon
the
chest
was
left
for
dunsack
at
the
foot
of
hardy
street
sir
as
you
ordered
the
inspector
sent
it
off
complimentary
with
your
personal
things
gerrit
asked
he
did
stop
to
get
a
whiff
of
it
then
the
other
shook
his
head
edward
dunsack
asked
me
to
ship
it
here
and
explained
that
it
was
only
junk
he
was
bringing
home
but
what
it
amounts
to
is
about
a
case
of
patna
opium
he
lucky
they
turned
inside
william
was
in
the
library
and
gerrit
instinctively
followed
his
father
into
the
room
william
surveyed
him
with
a
moody
discontent
what
i
ca
understand
he
proceeded
is
why
you
call
it
a
marriage
why
you
brought
your
woman
here
to
us
to
rhoda
and
the
children
it
simple
enough
gerrit
replied
taou
yuen
is
my
wife
we
are
married
exactly
as
rhoda
and
you
are
she
is
not
my
woman
in
the
sense
you
mean
i
wo
allow
that
william
how
can
it
matter
what
you
will
or
will
not
allow
when
everyone
think
the
other
shipmasters
have
had
chinese
mistresses
before
yes
and
smuggled
them
into
salem
but
this
conduct
of
yours
is
beyond
speech
gerrit
ammidon
said
do
carry
this
too
far
anger
like
a
hot
cloud
oppressed
him
i
am
married
legally
and
if
anything
by
a
ceremony
less
preposterous
than
your
own
taou
yuen
is
not
open
to
any
man
or
woman
suspicions
i
am
overwhelmingly
indebted
to
her
but
she
not
your
race
william
ammidon
muttered
she
is
a
confucian
or
taoist
or
some
such
thing
you
unitarian
one
day
a
week
and
father
is
congregational
a
methodist
and
no
one
knows
what
i
am
gerrit
cried
good
god
what
does
all
that
matter
is
a
religion
a
religion
do
you
suppose
a
lord
worth
the
name
would
be
anything
but
entertained
by
such
spiteful
little
dogmas
a
sincere
greased
nigger
with
his
voodoo
must
be
as
good
as
any
of
us
that
is
too
strong
gerrit
jeremy
objected
you
get
nowhere
crying
down
christianity
if
i
could
find
it
the
younger
declared
bitterly
i
feel
differently
it
right
enough
in
the
bible
well
we
go
on
to
boston
this
is
your
home
his
father
repeated
naturally
william
all
of
us
have
been
disturbed
but
nothing
beyond
that
i
trust
we
are
a
loyal
family
what
you
done
ca
be
mended
with
hard
words
she
may
become
very
fashionable
gerrit
mockingly
told
his
brother
it
be
a
blow
to
camilla
jeremy
chuckled
some
rice
must
be
cooked
manchus
do
live
on
rice
gerrit
replied
they
do
bind
the
feet
either
nor
wear
the
common
chinese
clothes
rhoda
will
understand
better
again
in
his
room
he
found
his
wife
bending
over
a
gorgeous
heap
of
satins
bright
mazarines
and
ornaments
we
go
down
to
supper
soon
he
told
her
already
there
were
signs
of
her
presence
about
the
room
the
chest
of
drawers
was
covered
with
gold
and
jade
and
green
amber
painted
paper
fans
set
on
ivory
and
tortoise
shell
and
lacquer
fan
boxes
coral
hairpins
sandalwood
combs
silver
rouge
pots
and
rose
quartz
perfume
bottles
with
canary
silk
cords
and
tassels
on
a
familiar
table
was
her
pipe
wound
in
gilt
wire
and
the
flowered
satin
tobacco
case
an
old
coin
was
hanging
at
the
head
of
the
bed
a
charm
against
evil
spirits
and
on
a
stand
was
the
amethyst
image
of
the
goddess
of
mercy
taou
yuen
sank
on
the
floor
with
a
little
embarrassed
laugh
at
the
confusion
in
which
he
had
surprised
her
let
your
attitude
be
grave
he
quoted
from
the
book
of
rites
with
a
pretended
severity
her
amusement
rose
in
a
ripple
of
mirth
he
opened
his
desk
rearranging
the
disorder
brought
about
by
its
transportation
and
when
he
turned
she
was
prostrate
in
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
she
breathed
the
invocation
to
buddha
this
at
an
end
she
announced
now
i
am
grave
and
respectful
for
your
family
supper
gerrit
admitted
to
himself
promised
to
be
a
painful
occasion
conversation
rose
sporadically
and
quickly
died
in
glances
of
irrepressible
curiosity
directed
at
his
wife
she
on
the
contrary
showed
no
pointed
interest
in
her
surroundings
and
in
her
hesitating
slurred
english
answered
rhoda
few
questions
without
putting
any
in
return
camilla
preserved
a
frozen
silence
sidsall
was
pleasantly
conciliating
in
her
attitude
toward
the
novel
situation
janet
her
lips
moving
noiselessly
was
rapt
in
amazement
and
laurel
smiled
abashed
at
meeting
taou
yuen
eyes
the
recounting
of
his
delayed
return
offered
gerrit
a
welcome
relief
from
the
pervading
strain
there
no
tea
to
speak
of
at
shanghai
and
i
took
on
a
mixed
cargo
pongees
and
porcelain
and
matting
i
got
camphor
and
cassia
and
seven
hundred
peculs
of
ginger
then
i
decided
to
lay
a
course
to
manilla
for
some
of
the
cheroots
father
likes
the
weather
was
fine
i
had
a
good
cargo
and
well
we
pleasured
out
to
honolulu
i
was
riding
the
island
horses
and
shipping
oil
when
the
schooner
arrived
from
the
coast
with
the
news
of
the
gold
discovery
in
california
every
boat
in
the
harbor
was
loaded
to
the
trucks
crowded
with
passengers
at
their
weight
in
ginseng
and
laid
for
san
francisco
well
i
was
caught
with
the
rest
five
thousand
dollars
was
offered
me
to
carry
a
gentleman
and
his
attendant
two
others
would
pay
three
for
the
same
purpose
stowage
was
worth
what
you
asked
the
made
a
good
run
then
about
a
day
from
land
broadrick
told
me
that
there
would
be
a
seaman
on
the
ship
an
hour
after
we
anchored
they
were
all
crazy
with
gold
fever
he
said
i
could
see
too
that
they
were
excited
the
watch
hung
under
the
weather
rail
jabbering
like
parrots
an
uglier
crew
of
sea
lawyers
never
developed
there
was
one
thing
to
do
and
i
did
it
called
them
aft
and
gave
them
some
hot
scouse
they
shipped
for
salem
and
there
they
must
go
i
did
anchor
but
stood
off
the
harbor
was
crowded
with
deserted
vessels
like
some
hell
for
ships
and
sent
the
jolly
boat
in
with
the
passengers
and
a
couple
of
men
they
did
come
back
you
may
be
sure
the
consignment
for
san
francisco
i
carried
out
that
evening
for
i
made
sail
at
once
you
had
a
pretty
time
getting
a
way
on
her
jeremy
ammidon
remarked
i
did
gerrit
acknowledged
shortly
the
second
mate
ear
was
taken
loose
by
a
belaying
pin
that
flew
out
of
the
dark
like
a
gull
broadrick
had
a
bad
minute
in
the
port
forecastle
after
he
had
ordered
all
hands
on
deck
a
third
time
the
fine
weather
left
us
though
and
that
kept
the
crew
busy
we
carried
away
the
mast
and
yard
before
we
were
within
a
thousand
miles
of
the
latitude
of
the
horn
that
hit
us
like
a
cannon
ball
of
ice
you
know
what
it
is
at
its
worst
he
told
his
father
weeks
of
snow
and
hail
and
fog
and
gales
and
not
for
anything
can
you
keep
an
easting
god
knows
how
a
ship
lives
through
the
seas
but
she
does
she
does
and
you
lose
the
magellan
clouds
astern
the
old
man
nodded
gerrit
was
relieved
however
when
supper
ended
and
his
wife
formally
departed
for
her
room
immediately
slipping
a
hand
inside
rhoda
arm
he
conducted
her
to
the
i
like
you
to
know
more
about
it
he
said
directly
it
was
very
extraordinary
a
lú
kikwáng
was
a
high
official
of
the
canton
customs
and
when
shanghai
was
declared
an
open
port
in
they
made
him
hoppo
there
i
remembered
him
at
canton
a
dignified
old
duck
with
eighty
or
a
hundred
servants
to
keep
anyone
from
possibly
speaking
to
him
of
business
but
there
had
been
some
trouble
about
foreign
vessels
selling
saltpeter
illegally
and
he
knew
some
english
we
had
quite
a
friendly
little
consultation
yet
it
had
prepared
me
for
his
coming
off
to
the
at
shanghai
with
a
linguist
and
an
air
of
the
greatest
mystery
his
manner
was
beautiful
of
course
absolutely
tranquil
and
that
made
what
they
said
what
he
hoped
seem
even
wilder
than
it
was
his
son
it
appeared
had
married
and
was
accidentally
drowned
in
the
great
canal
hardly
a
month
after
the
ceremony
his
widow
belonged
then
to
the
husband
family
and
from
that
moment
her
had
had
nothing
but
bad
luck
he
had
been
robbed
his
best
stallion
died
there
had
been
a
flood
in
his
tea
which
not
only
spoiled
the
crop
but
filled
the
ground
with
silt
it
was
impossible
to
relate
his
calamities
he
consulted
a
necromancer
at
last
and
learned
that
it
was
all
caused
by
the
presence
of
taou
yuen
this
you
see
made
the
difficulty
as
it
a
frightful
disgrace
to
return
a
married
daughter
to
her
own
father
home
and
lú
had
grown
very
fond
of
her
she
was
extremely
clever
and
virtuous
he
said
the
other
thing
was
to
kill
her
or
force
her
to
commit
suicide
he
told
me
very
calmly
that
he
would
like
to
avoid
this
then
in
the
linguist
most
flowery
manner
they
went
on
with
what
lú
kikwáng
proposed
he
had
recognized
that
i
was
a
man
of
propriety
and
he
wondered
if
i
would
take
taou
yuen
away
to
america
with
me
very
secretly
though
there
would
be
an
uproar
if
it
were
known
that
a
manchu
woman
had
been
married
to
a
foreigner
i
could
see
her
first
in
his
garden
without
her
knowing
anything
about
it
it
needless
to
tell
you
that
i
went
with
them
that
afternoon
a
meeting
was
arranged
for
the
next
day
he
broke
off
sitting
forward
with
elbows
on
knees
gazing
fixedly
at
his
clasped
hands
you
make
that
very
clear
gerrit
his
replied
i
now
understand
the
past
almost
as
well
as
yourself
but
it
the
future
in
doubt
about
i
saw
immediately
that
your
wife
was
not
an
ordinary
woman
it
would
be
much
easier
if
she
were
certainly
you
do
intend
to
stay
here
at
java
head
but
that
is
immaterial
wherever
you
go
in
america
it
will
not
be
suitable
for
her
she
be
no
more
at
home
with
your
friends
than
you
with
hers
i
feel
terribly
sad
about
it
gerrit
you
were
as
selfish
as
only
a
man
can
be
you
are
unjust
rhoda
he
protested
taou
yuen
was
willing
to
come
she
had
read
about
other
countries
and
saw
a
great
deal
of
the
english
wife
of
a
rich
dutch
factor
at
shanghai
as
lú
kikwáng
said
wonderfully
intelligent
i
think
she
is
happy
too
rubbish
of
course
she
loves
you
i
am
not
talking
about
that
how
will
she
get
along
while
you
are
away
on
your
long
voyages
she
possibly
live
in
the
cabin
of
a
ship
and
do
you
suppose
she
be
contented
in
salem
with
you
absent
for
a
year
we
have
as
many
chances
of
success
as
any
other
marriage
he
asserted
the
whole
business
is
foolish
enough
that
opinion
might
do
for
a
single
shipmaster
with
only
a
month
or
two
out
of
the
year
on
land
when
you
were
free
gerrit
your
impatience
with
convention
was
refreshing
and
possible
but
ca
you
see
that
you
have
given
up
your
liberty
you
have
tied
your
hands
however
loudly
you
may
cry
out
against
society
now
you
are
a
part
of
us
foolish
or
not
find
that
your
wife
has
anchored
you
in
salem
boston
or
singapore
no
matter
where
you
go
people
will
reach
and
hurt
you
through
her
she
is
very
gorgeous
and
placid
superior
on
the
surface
but
the
heart
gerrit
that
is
made
of
jade
and
ivory
and
silk
i
bring
down
your
presents
he
told
her
avoiding
any
further
present
discussion
of
his
marriage
has
father
failed
do
you
think
his
tempers
are
vigorous
as
ever
he
seems
baggier
about
the
eyes
and
throat
he
is
just
as
quick
but
it
exhausts
him
more
things
would
be
much
better
if
he
were
only
content
to
let
william
manage
at
the
countinghouse
times
are
shifting
so
quickly
with
these
new
clipper
ships
and
direct
passages
and
political
changes
there
no
longer
any
doubt
about
the
clippers
gerrit
declared
the
california
gold
rush
will
attend
to
that
in
his
room
he
found
taou
yuen
in
soft
white
silk
worked
with
bamboo
leaves
on
the
day
bed
smoking
she
rose
immediately
as
he
entered
and
coming
close
to
him
ran
her
cool
fingers
through
his
hair
he
stood
gazing
out
at
the
dim
oil
flares
that
marked
the
confines
of
washington
square
considering
all
that
rhoda
had
said
strangely
enough
it
led
his
thoughts
away
from
his
wife
they
reverted
to
nettie
vollar
he
had
been
he
realized
very
nearly
in
love
with
her
what
he
meant
by
that
inaccurate
term
was
that
if
the
affair
had
continued
a
little
longer
he
would
have
insisted
on
marrying
her
nettie
was
not
indifferent
to
him
an
impersonal
feeling
had
attracted
him
to
her
a
resentment
of
her
treatment
by
the
larger
part
of
salem
particularly
the
oblique
admiration
of
the
men
his
supersensitiveness
to
any
form
of
injustice
had
driven
him
into
the
protest
of
calling
and
accompanying
her
with
an
exaggerated
politeness
about
the
streets
it
had
not
been
difficult
she
was
luxurious
a
very
vivid
woman
gerrit
however
had
made
a
point
of
repressing
any
response
to
that
aspect
of
their
intercourse
the
sheerest
necessity
for
the
preservation
of
his
disdain
she
had
cried
on
his
shoulder
in
his
arms
practically
he
had
acted
in
the
purely
fraternal
manner
but
the
thing
was
reaching
a
natural
conclusion
when
her
grandfather
barzil
dunsack
had
interfered
with
his
unsupportably
frank
accusations
and
command
the
had
been
ready
for
sea
and
his
gerrit
imperious
resentment
had
carried
him
out
of
the
dunsacks
house
to
shanghai
and
taou
yuen
without
another
word
to
nettie
how
strangely
life
progressed
without
chart
or
intelligent
observations
or
papers
he
heard
the
tap
of
his
wife
pipe
there
was
a
faint
sweetish
odor
of
drugged
tobacco
and
the
scent
of
cloves
in
which
she
saturated
herself
outside
was
salem
dim
and
without
perceptible
movement
the
clock
in
the
hall
struck
ten
taou
yuen
did
approach
him
again
nor
speak
her
perceptions
were
wonderfully
acute
the
sense
of
loneliness
that
sometimes
overtook
him
on
shore
deepened
a
feeling
of
impotence
as
if
he
had
suddenly
waked
lost
and
helpless
in
an
unfamiliar
planet
there
was
the
soft
whisper
of
his
wife
passage
across
the
room
in
the
lamplight
the
paint
on
her
cheeks
made
startling
unnatural
patches
of
paint
the
reflections
slid
over
the
liquid
black
mass
of
her
hair
died
in
the
lustrous
creamy
folds
of
her
garment
she
was
at
once
grotesque
and
impressive
like
a
figure
in
a
chinese
pantomime
watched
from
the
western
auditorium
of
his
inheritance
his
fondness
for
her
his
admiration
had
not
lessened
he
surveyed
his
position
the
presence
here
in
his
room
at
java
head
of
taou
yuen
with
amazement
all
the
small
culminating
episodes
lost
the
result
was
beyond
credence
his
thoughts
returned
to
rhoda
accusation
of
selfishness
the
disaster
implied
in
her
pity
for
his
wife
he
tried
again
to
analyze
his
marriage
discover
whatever
justification
security
it
possessed
was
his
admiration
for
taou
yuen
sufficient
provision
for
his
part
of
their
future
together
it
was
founded
largely
on
her
superiority
to
the
world
he
had
known
and
here
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
convince
himself
that
his
wedding
had
not
been
merely
the
result
of
romantic
accident
he
knew
that
the
sensual
had
had
almost
no
part
in
it
it
had
been
mental
an
act
of
pity
crystallizing
his
revolt
against
what
he
felt
to
be
the
impotence
of
christian
ethics
yet
this
was
not
sufficient
for
he
like
rhoda
had
found
under
his
wife
immobility
the
flux
of
immemorial
woman
no
it
was
enough
but
more
existed
he
was
certain
of
that
no
one
could
expect
him
now
to
experience
the
thrill
of
idealized
passion
that
was
the
sole
property
of
youth
what
feeling
he
had
had
for
nettie
he
was
obliged
to
return
to
her
from
the
fact
that
it
was
the
only
possible
comparison
had
come
from
very
much
the
same
source
as
the
other
the
old
impersonal
motives
the
danger
rhoda
pointed
out
had
been
admitted
when
his
marriage
made
impossible
the
continuation
of
that
aloof
position
he
doubted
that
it
could
change
him
so
utterly
the
thought
of
the
entertainment
his
wife
would
afford
him
in
salem
expanded
he
regretted
that
the
best
the
calling
and
comments
of
the
women
was
necessarily
lost
to
him
but
taou
yuen
would
repeat
a
great
deal
she
too
had
a
sly
sense
of
the
ridiculous
he
hoped
that
his
did
suppose
her
helpless
the
impenetrable
manchu
control
gave
her
a
pitiless
advantage
over
any
less
absolute
civilization
in
the
darkness
before
sleep
the
heavy
exotic
scents
in
the
room
oppressed
him
strangely
he
rose
early
and
quietly
dressing
went
out
into
the
garden
buds
on
the
june
roses
against
the
high
blank
fence
on
the
street
were
swelling
into
visible
crimson
there
were
the
stamping
of
horses
feet
on
the
cobbles
of
the
stable
inclosure
the
heavy
breathing
and
admonitions
of
the
coachman
wielding
a
currycomb
the
sunlight
streamed
down
through
pale
green
willow
and
tall
lilac
bushes
through
the
octagonal
latticed
summerhouse
and
across
the
vivid
sod
to
the
door
gerrit
turned
and
entered
the
farther
yard
where
his
father
was
inspecting
the
pear
trees
the
will
need
new
copper
sheathing
gerrit
said
pretty
well
stripped
forward
take
her
around
to
the
salem
marine
railway
at
the
foot
of
english
street
a
fine
ship
gerrit
with
a
proper
hull
i
tell
you
they
never
improve
on
the
french
lines
she
wo
go
into
the
wind
with
a
clipper
he
admitted
but
i
sail
her
on
a
fair
breeze
with
anything
afloat
if
you
come
to
that
his
father
asserted
nothing
handsomer
will
ever
be
seen
than
an
east
in
the
northeast
trades
with
the
captain
on
the
in
a
cocked
hat
and
sword
the
shoals
of
flying
fish
and
albacore
skittering
about
a
transom
as
high
and
carved
and
gilded
as
a
church
the
royal
pennant
at
the
mainmast
head
maybe
it
would
be
the
of
with
her
cannons
shining
and
the
midshipmen
running
about
yes
the
younger
man
returned
and
taking
in
her
light
sails
at
sunset
dropping
astern
like
an
island
the
john
company
ruining
british
shipping
jeremy
ammidon
muttered
one
of
his
favorite
pessimistic
complaints
what
did
you
say
her
name
was
he
demanded
abruptly
taou
yuen
taou
yuen
ammidon
the
elder
pronounced
experimentally
it
sound
right
the
two
wo
go
together
but
they
have
gerrit
declared
he
thought
impatiently
that
he
must
listen
to
a
repetition
of
rhoda
assertions
i
do
know
much
about
jeremy
proceeded
all
i
saw
when
i
was
younger
was
the
little
playing
mora
and
wailing
over
their
infernal
fiddles
something
about
the
moon
and
a
bowl
of
water
lilies
taou
yuen
did
not
come
down
to
breakfast
and
gerrit
stayed
away
from
their
room
until
her
toilet
must
be
finished
it
was
sunday
and
with
the
customary
preparation
for
church
under
way
william
said
i
suppose
you
will
go
down
to
the
ship
the
hidden
question
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
at
once
stirred
into
being
all
gerrit
perversity
no
he
replied
carelessly
we
go
with
you
this
morning
that
unheard
of
william
exclaimed
heatedly
a
woman
in
all
her
paint
and
perfume
and
outrageous
clothes
in
north
church
with
with
my
family
i
wo
have
it
do
you
understand
no
worse
than
what
you
see
there
every
week
gerrit
retorted
calmly
corsets
and
feathers
and
female
gimcracks
plenty
of
rouge
and
cologne
too
it
will
give
them
something
new
to
stare
at
and
whisper
about
william
ammidon
choked
on
his
anger
and
his
wife
laid
a
gloved
hand
on
his
arm
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
it
she
told
him
it
ca
hurt
anyone
she
is
gerrit
wife
you
see
above
the
shipmaster
said
to
taou
yuen
we
are
going
to
church
with
the
family
he
surveyed
her
clothes
with
a
faint
glimmer
of
amusement
she
had
he
saw
made
herself
especially
resplendent
as
a
manchu
the
long
gown
was
satin
with
black
bats
a
symbol
of
happiness
whirling
on
thickly
embroidered
silver
clouds
over
which
she
wore
a
sleeve
coat
fastened
with
white
jade
and
glittering
with
spangles
of
beaten
copper
her
slippers
were
pale
rose
and
fresh
apple
blossoms
which
she
had
had
brought
from
the
yard
made
a
headdress
fixed
with
long
silver
and
dull
red
ivory
pins
she
smiled
obediently
at
his
announcement
and
with
a
fan
of
peacock
silks
and
betel
nuts
in
a
pouch
like
a
tea
rose
hanging
by
a
cord
from
a
jade
button
she
signified
her
readiness
to
proceed
william
had
gone
on
foot
with
his
girls
jeremy
was
seldom
in
church
and
rhoda
taou
yuen
beside
her
with
gerrit
facing
them
followed
in
the
barouche
it
seemed
to
the
latter
that
they
were
almost
immediately
at
the
door
of
north
church
the
leisurely
congregation
filling
the
walk
stiffened
in
incredulous
amazement
as
gerrit
handed
his
wife
to
the
pavement
rhoda
went
promptly
forward
nodding
in
response
to
countless
stupefied
greetings
while
gerrit
ammidon
moved
on
at
taou
yuen
side
prepared
he
restrained
the
latter
from
a
prostration
in
the
hall
of
the
church
nothing
had
changed
the
umbrella
trough
still
bore
the
numbers
of
the
pews
the
stair
wound
gloomily
up
to
the
organ
loft
he
again
found
the
subdued
interior
the
maroon
upholstery
the
flat
gothic
squares
of
the
ceiling
and
dark
red
stone
walls
a
place
of
reposeful
charm
the
ammidons
had
two
of
the
box
pews
against
the
right
wall
his
brother
and
children
were
in
the
second
and
inside
the
other
small
inclosure
he
shut
the
gate
and
took
his
place
on
a
contracted
corner
bench
taou
yuen
sat
with
rhoda
against
the
back
of
the
pew
the
former
blazing
like
a
gorgeous
flower
on
the
shadowed
surface
of
a
pool
smiled
serenely
at
him
he
could
hear
the
hum
of
subdued
comment
running
like
ignited
powder
through
the
church
familiar
faces
turned
blankly
toward
him
or
nodded
in
patent
confusion
the
men
he
noted
expressed
a
single
rigid
condemnation
the
women
in
crisp
light
dresses
and
ribboned
bonnets
were
franker
in
their
curiosity
taou
yuen
was
a
loadstone
for
their
glances
as
the
service
progressed
her
face
grew
expressionless
fretted
sandalwood
bracelets
drooped
over
her
folded
hands
and
miniature
dragon
flies
quivered
on
the
gold
wires
of
her
earrings
the
sharp
perfumes
of
the
east
drifted
out
and
mingled
with
the
western
scents
of
extracts
and
powders
he
only
saw
that
she
was
politely
chewing
betel
nut
it
was
he
told
himself
reverting
to
his
critical
attitude
toward
salem
that
he
was
lacking
in
charity
toward
his
neighbors
or
that
he
felt
any
superiority
but
the
quality
that
signally
roused
his
antagonism
was
precisely
the
men
present
aspect
of
heavy
censure
and
boundless
propriety
their
stolid
attitude
of
justifying
the
spiritual
consummation
promised
by
the
sermon
and
hymns
the
long
night
watches
the
anxiety
of
the
sea
the
profound
mysteries
of
the
wheeling
stars
and
the
silence
of
the
ocean
at
dawns
had
given
him
he
dimly
realized
an
inarticulate
reverence
for
the
supreme
mystery
of
creation
he
was
unable
to
put
it
into
words
or
facile
prayer
but
it
was
the
guarded
foundation
of
most
that
he
was
and
it
bred
in
him
a
contempt
for
lesser
signs
the
religion
of
his
birth
the
faith
of
taou
yuen
the
fetishism
of
the
zanzibar
coast
he
had
regarded
as
equally
important
or
futile
the
mere
wash
of
the
immensity
of
beauty
the
inexorable
destiny
that
had
seemed
to
breathe
on
him
alone
at
the
stern
of
his
ship
he
lost
himself
now
in
the
keenness
of
his
remembered
emotion
the
church
faded
into
a
far
horizon
he
felt
the
slight
heave
of
the
ship
and
heard
the
creaking
of
the
wheel
as
the
steersman
shifted
his
hands
from
aloft
came
the
faint
slapping
of
the
bunt
lines
on
rigid
canvas
the
loose
hemp
slippers
of
the
crew
sounded
across
the
deck
the
water
whispered
alongside
the
ship
bell
was
struck
and
repeated
in
a
diminished
note
on
the
topgallant
forecastle
the
morning
rose
from
below
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
the
pure
air
freshened
his
thoughts
were
recalled
to
the
present
by
the
dogmatic
insistence
of
the
clergyman
voice
promising
heaven
threatening
hell
his
gaze
rested
on
the
chalky
debility
of
madra
clifford
the
service
over
the
aisle
past
the
ammidon
pews
was
filled
with
a
inquisitive
throng
rhoda
chose
to
wait
until
the
greater
part
was
past
and
then
she
followed
with
the
unmoved
taou
yuen
and
gerrit
this
is
my
brother
wife
he
heard
the
former
say
saltonstone
gerrit
sister
clifford
and
miss
vermeil
yes
from
shanghai
overdue
we
were
worried
of
course
taou
yuen
smiled
vigorously
and
flapped
the
vivid
fan
against
her
brilliant
colors
the
carved
jade
and
embroideries
silver
and
apple
blossoms
the
other
women
looked
colorless
in
wide
book
muslin
and
barége
with
short
veils
of
tulle
illusion
hanging
from
bonnets
of
rice
straw
and
glazed
crêpe
palpably
shocked
by
her
oriental
face
masked
in
paint
her
chinese
heathen
origin
yet
they
fingered
the
amazing
needlework
and
wondered
over
the
weight
of
her
satins
the
men
he
knew
gave
him
for
the
most
part
a
curt
greeting
they
glanced
more
covertly
at
his
wife
he
understood
exactly
what
thoughts
brought
out
this
condemnation
soiled
by
private
speculation
and
his
disdain
mounted
at
their
sleek
backs
and
glossy
tile
hats
supported
on
stiffly
bent
arms
after
dinner
he
walked
through
the
warm
sunny
emptiness
of
the
afternoon
to
derby
wharf
and
the
standing
on
the
wharf
smoking
a
cheroot
he
leaned
back
upon
his
cane
studying
the
ship
with
a
gaze
that
missed
no
detail
there
was
not
a
sound
from
the
water
across
the
harbor
peach
point
seemed
about
to
dissolve
in
a
faint
green
haze
a
strong
scent
of
mingled
spices
came
from
the
warehouses
there
was
the
splash
of
oars
in
the
basin
beyond
and
the
more
distant
peal
of
a
church
bell
at
the
sound
of
footfalls
behind
him
he
turned
and
saw
nettie
vollar
and
her
uncle
edward
dunsack
a
dark
color
rose
in
the
girl
cheek
and
her
hand
pulled
involuntarily
at
dunsack
arm
as
if
she
wished
to
retreat
gerrit
thought
that
she
had
aged
since
he
had
latest
met
her
mouth
with
its
full
slightly
drooping
lower
lip
had
lost
something
of
its
fresh
arch
her
eyes
though
they
still
preserved
their
black
sparkle
were
plainly
resentful
edward
dunsack
medium
tall
but
thin
almost
to
emaciation
had
a
riven
sallow
face
with
silvery
hair
and
eyes
with
contracted
pupils
well
nettie
gerrit
said
moving
forward
promptly
it
pleasant
to
see
you
again
her
hand
was
cold
and
still
dunsack
too
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
my
chest
the
latter
told
him
unmoved
by
gerrit
quizzical
gaze
glad
to
do
it
for
you
the
other
replied
it
came
ashore
with
my
personal
things
and
so
perhaps
saved
you
something
perhaps
dunsack
agreed
levelly
looking
down
at
the
cob
filling
of
the
wharf
nettie
vollar
said
you
came
home
married
i
hear
and
to
a
chinese
lady
gerrit
assented
you
certainly
know
her
and
like
her
too
taou
yuen
is
very
wise
and
without
the
prejudices
he
stopped
conscious
of
the
stupidity
of
his
attempted
kindness
nettie
looked
up
defiantly
biting
her
lip
a
familiar
trick
he
recalled
dunsack
interposed
you
will
find
that
the
chinese
have
none
of
your
little
sympathetic
tricks
no
foreigner
could
ever
grasp
the
depth
of
their
indifference
to
what
you
might
call
humanity
they
are
born
wise
as
you
say
but
weary
i
suppose
your
wife
plays
the
guitar
skillfully
and
sings
the
soochow
love
song
gerrit
ammidon
studied
him
with
somber
eyes
and
a
gathering
temper
it
was
however
impossible
to
decide
whether
the
implication
was
deliberately
insulting
he
would
have
any
canton
clerk
probably
saturated
with
opium
insinuate
that
his
affair
was
on
the
plane
of
that
of
a
drunken
sailor
my
wife
he
said
deliberately
is
a
manchu
lady
you
may
know
that
they
do
learn
dialect
songs
nor
ornament
tea
houses
very
remarkable
dunsack
returned
imperturbably
we
never
see
them
how
did
you
manage
a
and
did
you
send
the
hour
of
your
birth
to
the
calculator
of
destinies
then
there
is
so
much
to
remember
in
a
chinese
wedding
the
catties
of
tea
and
four
silver
ingots
the
earrings
and
red
and
green
silk
and
tao
priest
to
consult
the
gods
gerrit
heard
this
with
a
frowning
countenance
if
nettie
were
not
there
he
would
put
dunsack
forward
with
the
hypothetical
crew
to
which
he
belonged
he
felt
as
sorry
for
nettie
he
discovered
as
ever
it
moved
him
to
see
her
vivacity
of
life
her
appealingly
warm
color
slowly
dulled
by
salem
and
the
adventitious
circumstance
of
her
birth
what
a
dreary
existence
she
led
in
the
harsh
atmosphere
of
her
grandfather
and
the
solemn
house
on
hardy
street
at
one
time
he
had
fancied
that
he
might
change
it
when
now
here
was
taou
yuen
detached
and
superior
waiting
in
his
room
at
java
head
i
stopped
for
a
moment
to
look
at
the
ship
he
said
with
the
trace
of
an
ungracious
bow
and
must
get
back
the
sunlight
flung
a
warm
moted
veil
over
nettie
vollar
she
gave
him
a
startled
uncalculated
glance
of
almost
desperate
appeal
and
his
heart
responded
with
a
quickened
thud
edward
dunsack
was
sallow
and
enigmatic
with
thin
pinched
lips
v
the
stupid
bruiser
edward
dunsack
declared
in
a
thin
bitterness
that
startled
the
girl
at
his
side
the
low
sea
bully
he
was
gazing
at
the
resolute
back
of
captain
ammidon
a
surprising
hatred
filled
him
at
the
memory
of
the
other
intolerant
gaze
the
careless
contempt
of
his
words
he
thought
oddly
enough
of
the
delicate
and
ingenious
tortures
practiced
on
offenders
in
china
the
pleasant
mental
picture
followed
of
ammidon
bowed
in
a
wooden
collar
of
gerrit
ammidon
bambooed
sliced
slowly
choking
with
an
intense
sense
of
horror
he
caught
himself
dwelling
on
these
dripping
visions
his
hands
clasped
rigidly
a
sweat
stood
out
on
his
brow
in
a
realization
that
was
at
once
dread
and
a
about
him
lay
the
tranquil
salem
water
the
still
wharves
the
familiar
roofs
and
green
tree
tops
this
was
canton
he
told
himself
but
america
there
was
nettie
only
a
few
streets
away
was
his
house
his
own
home
all
solid
and
safe
and
reassuring
china
was
a
thing
of
the
past
its
insidious
secret
hold
broken
it
was
now
only
a
dream
of
evil
fascination
from
which
he
had
waked
to
the
reality
the
saving
substance
of
derby
wharf
it
his
domineering
manner
he
explained
the
outburst
to
nettie
all
shipmasters
have
it
as
if
the
world
were
a
vessel
they
damned
from
a
in
the
sky
i
never
could
put
up
with
them
he
is
very
kind
really
she
replied
looking
away
over
the
harbor
it
is
so
queer
marrying
a
chinese
woman
like
that
how
will
he
ever
get
along
with
her
or
be
happy
he
wo
edward
dunsack
asserted
leave
that
to
time
he
studied
her
attentively
was
it
anything
to
you
he
asked
it
might
have
been
she
acknowledged
listlessly
her
gaze
still
on
the
horizon
he
came
to
see
me
two
or
three
times
quite
differently
from
other
nice
men
and
took
me
to
a
concert
at
the
philharmonic
society
he
was
getting
to
like
me
i
could
tell
that
when
grandfather
interfered
i
see
dunsack
interrupted
with
the
immorality
of
the
supermoral
whatever
it
was
he
was
past
bearing
no
one
could
blame
gerrit
for
getting
into
a
fury
the
next
day
i
stood
almost
in
this
spot
it
was
late
afternoon
too
and
watched
the
sail
away
all
the
canvas
was
set
and
i
could
see
her
for
a
long
time
when
the
last
trace
had
gone
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
life
had
sunk
too
out
there
the
old
man
a
fool
he
said
bluntly
of
his
father
how
do
you
suppose
he
got
hold
of
a
manchu
he
shifted
his
thought
addressing
the
stillness
about
them
rather
than
his
companion
do
imagine
for
a
minute
that
you
are
superior
to
her
he
told
nettie
more
directly
there
is
nothing
more
remarkable
they
must
be
gorgeous
a
faint
color
stained
his
long
cheeks
what
incredible
luck
he
murmured
he
was
thinking
avidly
of
the
women
of
china
the
little
gay
girls
like
toys
the
momentary
glimpses
of
enameled
faces
in
hurrying
sedan
chairs
faces
of
ivory
stained
with
carmine
in
headdresses
a
sudden
impatience
at
nettie
vollar
obvious
person
and
clothes
expanded
to
a
detestation
of
an
atmosphere
he
had
but
a
minute
or
so
before
welcomed
as
an
escape
from
something
infinitely
worse
than
death
now
it
seemed
impossible
to
spend
a
life
in
salem
it
would
have
been
better
when
he
had
been
released
by
heard
and
company
to
have
taken
the
position
open
in
the
dutch
hong
he
was
in
a
continual
state
of
such
vacillation
as
if
he
were
the
seat
of
two
separate
and
antagonistic
personalities
rather
he
changed
the
figure
in
him
the
east
struggled
with
the
west
it
was
necessary
for
the
latter
to
triumph
the
difficulty
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
first
was
represented
by
an
actual
circumstance
while
the
other
was
only
a
dim
apprehension
a
weakened
allegiance
to
ties
never
strong
he
cursed
the
extraordinary
chance
that
against
every
probability
had
brought
the
chest
of
opium
safely
to
him
here
its
purchase
had
been
the
result
of
habit
evading
his
will
he
had
despatched
it
in
that
seesawing
contest
by
a
precarious
route
half
hoping
that
it
would
be
lost
or
seized
and
when
he
had
seen
the
chest
carried
down
hardy
street
to
his
door
a
species
of
terror
had
fastened
upon
him
a
premonition
of
an
evil
spirit
flickering
above
him
in
a
turning
of
oily
smoke
why
had
he
pitched
the
thing
into
the
water
at
the
foot
of
their
yard
there
was
time
still
he
would
take
the
balls
of
opium
and
dispose
of
them
secretly
a
sudden
energy
a
renewed
sense
of
strength
flooded
him
this
distaste
for
nettie
changed
into
a
pity
at
the
ill
luck
that
had
followed
her
she
did
deserve
it
generous
emotions
expanded
his
heart
he
dreamed
of
taking
hold
of
his
father
small
commerce
in
rum
and
sugar
with
the
west
indies
and
turning
it
into
a
concern
as
rich
and
powerful
as
ammidon
ammidon
and
saltonstone
why
not
they
too
would
have
a
big
white
house
on
washington
square
or
chestnut
street
with
servants
chinese
servants
and
horses
and
great
ships
sailing
in
laden
with
the
east
why
not
indeed
he
edward
dunsack
had
more
brains
than
jeremy
ammidon
that
stiff
old
man
with
a
face
the
color
of
a
damask
plum
his
niece
would
go
to
all
the
balls
at
franklin
and
hamilton
halls
the
injustice
of
her
position
overcome
by
an
impressively
increasing
fortune
abstractly
he
patted
her
shoulder
with
a
hand
as
long
and
gaunt
and
yellow
as
his
face
all
this
would
come
as
a
result
of
throwing
the
opium
into
the
harbor
it
was
as
good
as
accomplished
in
the
face
of
his
prospective
he
felt
already
the
equal
of
anyone
in
salem
if
gerrit
ammidon
had
married
a
manchu
lady
it
was
his
privilege
no
duty
to
call
and
put
his
experience
in
things
chinese
at
their
command
she
would
speak
only
a
little
if
any
english
no
one
here
understood
the
preparation
of
her
food
her
delicate
necessity
for
dishes
not
the
property
of
an
entire
household
a
hundred
such
details
of
which
the
infinitely
cruder
west
must
be
ignorant
he
thought
complacently
that
he
would
understand
her
better
than
anyone
else
in
salem
in
boston
in
america
far
better
than
her
husband
she
would
without
doubt
learn
to
depend
on
him
they
would
laugh
together
at
the
manners
and
people
about
them
ammidon
would
be
away
for
long
periods
on
the
china
his
dreams
broke
off
with
a
sardonic
laugh
a
repetition
of
the
tone
in
which
he
had
objurgated
the
such
visions
were
the
property
of
youth
and
he
was
and
nothing
more
than
a
discredited
clerk
who
had
fled
across
the
world
from
a
shadow
but
he
was
right
he
had
seen
white
men
who
had
caught
the
breath
of
china
accepting
just
such
opportunities
as
the
one
offered
to
him
after
his
dismissal
by
augustine
heard
at
the
dutch
hong
he
be
expected
to
talk
about
his
late
employer
such
situations
he
had
realized
in
a
rarely
illuminating
flash
were
only
temporary
a
descending
flight
these
men
resembled
the
fate
of
say
a
brig
sailing
into
the
china
sea
in
all
the
perfection
of
order
of
the
british
marine
at
perhaps
hong
kong
sold
to
a
native
firm
she
would
be
refitted
under
an
extravagant
flag
and
slowly
the
order
would
depart
until
in
a
slovenly
tangle
of
rigging
and
defilement
she
be
seen
yawing
on
secret
and
nauseous
errands
a
homely
chime
of
bells
was
repeated
from
the
town
a
ship
fast
strained
resinously
with
the
changing
tide
it
will
be
getting
on
toward
supper
nettie
told
him
they
walked
slowly
from
the
wharf
turned
silently
into
derby
street
and
hardy
on
their
way
home
beyond
the
inner
fence
of
the
garden
the
thick
uneven
sod
reaching
to
the
water
was
dark
and
cool
against
the
luminous
flush
of
evening
a
sound
of
frying
and
heavy
odor
came
from
the
kitchen
and
kate
vollar
voice
informed
them
that
the
meal
was
ready
barzil
dunsack
bowed
his
head
over
the
table
and
pronounced
a
grace
in
startlingly
resonant
tones
the
reverent
humility
of
his
words
oddly
emphasized
by
a
sort
of
angry
impatience
it
seemed
as
if
he
at
once
subjected
himself
to
his
god
and
expressed
a
certain
dissatisfaction
with
his
forbearance
edward
dunsack
was
plunged
in
the
thought
of
the
resolution
he
intended
to
fulfill
that
evening
the
throwing
away
of
the
opium
had
lost
a
part
of
its
symbolic
meaning
it
now
seemed
even
a
little
rash
when
he
could
find
an
immediate
highly
profitable
market
the
opium
had
cost
him
seven
hundred
dollars
in
china
but
he
must
he
realized
be
firm
afterwards
in
his
room
facing
away
from
the
street
over
darkening
yards
and
gables
and
foliage
he
stood
gazing
at
the
chest
of
mango
wood
that
held
the
drug
edward
dunsack
unlocked
and
lifted
the
lid
on
the
tray
before
him
were
twenty
balls
each
the
size
of
his
two
fists
wrapped
in
a
hard
skin
of
poppy
leaves
and
there
was
a
similar
number
beneath
it
was
obvious
that
he
carry
a
tray
through
the
house
and
he
took
out
two
balls
after
which
he
secured
the
remainder
he
walked
quickly
down
the
stair
and
through
the
close
turning
of
the
lower
hall
that
led
through
a
side
door
to
the
yard
a
pale
rectangle
of
lamplight
fell
from
the
sitting
room
window
over
a
brick
path
and
ground
tramped
bare
of
grass
a
clinking
of
dishes
sounded
in
the
kitchen
the
sod
was
damp
and
perhaps
eight
feet
below
the
wooden
buttress
of
the
land
the
water
showed
impenetrably
black
safely
there
he
passed
a
tense
hand
over
a
brow
suddenly
wet
he
was
shaking
as
if
in
the
grip
of
a
chill
his
condition
needed
drastic
measures
the
cold
heavy
opium
gave
out
its
tantalizing
odor
in
a
minute
it
would
be
disposed
of
and
he
would
go
for
more
he
calculated
that
this
necessitated
twenty
trips
at
the
present
rate
a
bag
might
serve
his
purpose
better
he
raised
an
arm
with
an
opium
ball
but
his
hand
remained
suspended
in
air
an
inarticulate
protest
seized
him
a
suffocating
sense
of
impending
loss
he
would
never
be
able
to
get
patna
opium
here
it
was
a
valuable
medical
property
his
nerves
shook
at
the
thought
of
its
delights
then
as
if
without
his
volition
and
against
every
intention
his
arm
described
a
short
arc
and
his
hand
was
empty
there
was
the
impact
of
a
solid
object
striking
the
water
a
faint
ripple
on
the
motionless
expanse
and
then
absolute
silence
he
was
aghast
at
his
wanton
act
the
irreparable
waste
of
a
precious
substance
and
cursed
in
a
low
audible
cantonese
whose
concern
was
it
if
he
did
very
occasionally
smoke
a
pistol
how
could
it
possibly
matter
the
dreams
about
a
great
foreign
commerce
a
white
house
like
the
ammidons
were
futile
it
was
too
late
he
could
expect
nothing
from
life
but
the
unspeakable
monotony
of
his
father
dwelling
the
bare
office
he
had
worked
hard
been
as
full
of
splendid
early
resolutions
as
anyone
and
he
was
blamable
if
chance
balked
his
ambition
a
soul
was
nothing
more
than
a
twisting
leaf
in
the
wind
of
fate
there
remained
only
to
take
what
escape
was
offered
golden
visions
luxury
beauty
beyond
all
earth
his
contrary
determination
seemed
of
less
actuality
than
the
imagined
echoing
of
the
splash
that
still
hung
in
his
brain
it
was
a
thing
far
away
belonging
to
another
time
another
man
like
the
memory
of
a
period
of
charming
ignorance
the
thought
of
it
wove
a
strand
of
melancholy
into
his
present
mature
realization
like
the
delicate
scent
of
blossoming
trees
borne
to
him
on
the
evening
air
barely
perceptible
and
then
lost
in
the
pungency
of
the
opium
the
latter
became
mystically
all
china
the
irresistible
fascination
that
had
gradually
possessed
his
imagination
dulling
the
associations
of
his
heredity
and
birth
calling
him
further
and
further
into
its
secretive
heart
he
returned
to
his
room
where
he
put
back
the
second
ball
in
the
tray
of
its
chest
an
extraordinary
weariness
hung
over
him
there
was
a
sense
of
leaden
weight
in
his
arms
and
feet
flashes
of
a
different
perception
pierced
his
apathy
a
voice
seemingly
outside
his
being
whispered
of
danger
evil
and
danger
a
twisting
leaf
he
told
himself
again
with
his
deep
fatalism
the
memory
of
gerrit
ammidon
crisp
blue
gaze
his
vigorous
gestures
and
speech
became
an
intolerable
affront
representing
the
far
lost
point
of
his
own
departure
his
contrary
feelings
met
and
grappled
in
his
mind
but
in
the
end
the
past
salem
was
always
defeated
weaker
more
faintly
perceived
in
a
great
many
essentials
he
told
himself
he
had
become
chinese
in
sympathy
and
fiber
the
lamp
threw
a
smooth
gleam
over
the
mango
wood
chest
and
he
bent
turning
the
key
in
the
ornamental
brass
lock
he
could
reconsider
the
disposal
of
the
opium
there
was
no
hurry
he
had
no
intention
of
becoming
a
victim
to
the
drug
that
would
be
an
inconceivable
stupidity
the
negation
of
all
the
philosophy
he
had
gained
very
occasionally
his
thoughts
swung
to
the
surprising
fact
of
ammidon
chinese
wife
if
as
he
had
first
suspected
she
were
a
common
woman
of
the
port
who
had
made
a
fool
of
the
dull
sailor
he
perceived
the
making
of
a
very
entertaining
comedy
there
would
be
the
keenest
irony
in
exposing
her
to
himself
before
the
complacent
ignorance
of
her
husband
he
knew
such
women
convicted
in
chinese
perhaps
before
the
entire
ammidon
family
not
a
muscle
of
her
face
would
betray
surprise
or
concern
she
might
try
to
murder
him
very
ingeniously
but
never
descend
to
the
intrigue
the
lies
of
a
western
woman
placed
in
the
same
position
she
stoically
accept
the
situation
these
visions
ran
rapidly
vividly
through
his
brain
he
was
accustomed
to
them
a
greater
part
of
his
waking
life
was
filled
with
such
pictures
infinitely
more
alluring
persuasive
than
the
disappointing
actuality
he
got
out
of
his
clothes
and
in
a
loose
gown
of
black
silk
sat
at
his
open
window
his
chin
sunk
in
the
palm
of
a
hand
his
face
set
against
the
night
the
next
morning
at
the
breakfast
table
he
listened
with
a
fleering
mouth
to
his
father
long
dogmatic
grace
before
meat
his
sister
sat
opposite
their
parent
her
gaze
lowered
in
a
perpetual
amazement
her
entire
person
stamped
with
a
stupid
humility
there
was
nothing
humble
however
in
nettie
the
crisp
french
coloring
positively
crackled
with
an
electric
energy
her
mouth
was
set
in
a
rebellious
red
blot
studying
her
edward
dunsack
saw
that
she
was
prettier
than
he
had
first
realized
on
his
return
to
salem
he
speculated
over
the
story
she
had
told
him
yesterday
about
gerrit
ammidon
attachment
what
an
incredible
idiot
their
father
had
been
edward
would
have
relished
gerrit
as
a
good
would
have
come
to
them
all
from
such
a
connection
if
he
had
been
in
america
at
the
time
no
such
error
would
have
been
permitted
with
his
counsel
nettie
would
have
caught
ammidon
beyond
any
escape
he
wondered
if
the
girl
had
actually
cared
for
the
shipmaster
or
if
the
affair
had
been
nothing
more
than
a
sop
to
her
wounded
pride
and
isolation
in
a
way
beyond
his
present
understanding
this
seemed
to
be
considerably
important
if
she
had
loved
him
no
one
could
predict
what
her
attitude
might
be
in
any
future
development
of
their
contact
but
if
her
pride
only
had
been
involved
injured
she
might
readily
be
an
instrument
for
his
own
obscure
purposes
the
office
where
barzil
dunsack
conducted
the
limited
affairs
of
his
west
india
trading
was
a
small
building
back
of
the
dwelling
there
was
a
high
desk
at
which
a
clerk
stood
or
balanced
on
a
stool
a
more
formal
secretary
against
the
length
of
the
wall
with
a
careful
model
of
a
full
ship
the
spars
and
standing
rigging
slack
and
the
whole
gray
with
dust
a
cupboard
opposite
a
dilapidated
chair
or
so
and
a
iron
stove
for
wood
a
window
looked
out
across
the
grass
to
the
harbor
and
another
opened
blankly
against
a
board
fence
there
edward
dunsack
made
a
column
of
entries
in
a
script
fine
and
regular
but
occasionally
showing
an
uncontrollably
tremulous
line
he
was
conscious
of
this
tendency
growing
through
the
past
year
and
he
surveyed
his
writing
with
a
feeling
of
angry
dismay
try
as
he
might
with
a
frowning
concentration
to
pen
the
words
and
numerals
firmly
presently
his
attention
would
slip
his
hand
waver
ever
so
slightly
and
a
sudden
stricken
appearance
of
old
age
fasten
on
the
characters
by
heaven
he
throw
all
that
stinking
stuff
away
outside
the
day
was
immaculate
the
expanse
of
the
water
was
like
celestial
silk
such
sails
as
he
saw
resembled
white
clouds
the
early
morning
bird
song
had
subsided
but
a
persistent
robin
was
whistling
from
the
grass
by
the
open
door
the
petals
of
a
magnolia
were
slowly
shifting
obliquely
to
the
ground
he
could
hear
the
stir
of
derby
street
he
was
inexpressibly
weary
of
the
struggle
always
racking
his
being
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
the
midst
of
a
serene
world
he
was
tormented
by
some
inimicable
and
fatal
power
he
fastened
his
thoughts
on
commonplace
happier
objects
on
the
page
under
his
hand
the
entries
of
medford
rum
and
sugar
cane
and
molasses
and
the
infinitely
larger
affairs
of
ammidon
ammidon
and
saltonstone
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
call
on
jeremy
ammidon
family
the
latter
had
signified
by
his
visit
the
desire
to
end
the
misunderstanding
between
them
he
was
as
well
born
as
gerrit
ammidon
only
ill
chance
had
made
them
seem
differently
situated
anyhow
unlike
canton
mere
exterior
position
had
comparatively
little
weight
in
salem
the
shipmasters
the
more
important
merchants
arrogated
a
certain
superiority
to
themselves
but
it
broke
down
before
the
inborn
democracy
of
the
local
spirit
that
afternoon
he
decided
he
be
in
pleasant
street
and
later
he
dressed
with
the
most
meticulous
care
a
growing
doubt
seized
him
as
he
mounted
the
outside
steps
of
the
ammidons
impressive
house
but
he
crushed
it
down
and
firmly
rapped
with
the
polished
knocker
on
the
opened
door
the
family
a
servant
told
him
was
in
the
garden
and
he
followed
through
a
large
hall
into
a
formal
and
green
space
beyond
he
was
again
uncertain
before
the
number
of
people
grouped
about
a
summerhouse
and
apparently
watching
his
approach
with
cold
surprise
but
gerrit
ammidon
stepped
forward
and
greeted
him
with
an
adequately
level
civility
you
know
my
father
he
said
and
jeremy
ammidon
his
heavy
body
in
linen
above
which
his
face
was
dusky
put
out
an
abrupt
hand
there
was
a
brevard
a
slender
unconcerned
person
in
very
fashionable
but
restrained
clothes
william
ammidon
wife
a
large
woman
in
india
muslin
handsome
enough
edward
dunsack
conceded
in
the
obvious
american
sense
a
daughter
of
william
a
girl
blooming
into
womanhood
far
too
vigorous
and
brightly
colored
for
his
taste
and
gerrit
wife
the
latter
had
been
hidden
from
him
at
first
and
he
saw
her
suddenly
completely
his
surprise
caused
him
to
stand
in
an
awkward
suspense
never
had
he
imagined
that
a
woman
even
a
manchu
could
be
so
beautiful
he
recognized
in
a
score
of
unmistakable
details
that
she
was
of
irreproachably
high
birth
her
satins
were
embroidered
with
the
symbols
of
nobility
and
matrimonial
felicity
the
gold
fingernail
guards
the
jade
and
flowering
pearls
her
earrings
and
tasseled
tobacco
pouch
and
ivory
fan
were
all
in
the
most
superlative
manner
a
deep
pleasurable
excitement
filled
him
as
he
made
his
greeting
in
correct
chinese
the
long
delicate
oval
of
her
face
showed
no
emotion
at
the
sound
of
her
native
speech
and
she
returned
his
periods
in
a
slowly
chosen
mechanical
english
edward
dunsack
thought
that
as
he
spoke
an
expression
of
distaste
stamped
gerrit
features
however
he
was
left
in
no
doubt
my
wife
the
other
instructed
him
prefers
to
speak
english
that
is
the
only
way
she
has
of
picking
it
up
a
contempt
filled
dunsack
which
he
was
barely
able
to
keep
from
his
voice
and
manner
he
nodded
shortly
and
subsided
into
a
study
of
taou
yuen
so
open
that
she
must
have
become
aware
of
his
interest
seated
on
the
bench
that
circled
the
interior
of
the
latticed
summerhouse
she
moved
so
that
he
could
no
longer
see
her
face
brevard
was
beside
her
talking
in
a
low
amused
voice
there
was
a
ringing
peal
of
laughter
from
sidsall
ammidon
and
a
faint
infinitely
ripple
from
taou
yuen
the
brilliant
patch
of
her
gown
made
an
extraordinary
effect
in
the
salem
garden
edward
dunsack
recognized
the
scents
that
stirred
from
her
more
eastern
and
disturbing
even
than
opium
there
was
a
subtle
natural
odor
of
musk
the
perfumes
of
henna
and
clove
blossoms
and
santal
a
curious
double
feeling
possessed
him
in
the
split
consciousness
of
which
he
was
capable
he
had
the
sensation
of
having
come
in
the
suave
afternoon
garden
on
overwhelming
disaster
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
enraged
by
the
play
of
fate
that
had
given
such
a
woman
to
gerrit
ammidon
and
denied
him
with
his
special
appreciation
of
oriental
charm
the
slightest
satisfaction
a
more
general
hatred
of
gerrit
tightened
to
a
consuming
resentment
of
the
other
blind
fortune
one
thing
was
unmistakably
borne
upon
him
in
spite
of
the
courtesy
he
was
meeting
it
was
clear
that
he
could
not
hope
to
become
a
customary
visitor
at
the
ammidons
he
was
put
definitely
outside
the
community
of
interests
in
which
brevard
easily
entered
william
ammidon
joined
them
and
something
like
astonishment
at
dunsack
presence
was
visible
on
his
complacent
face
he
remained
however
in
a
stubborn
resistance
to
small
adverse
signs
in
the
hope
of
gaining
some
additional
facts
about
taou
yuen
she
had
been
he
learned
a
widow
and
gerrit
had
married
her
with
her
consent
although
the
latter
was
a
rich
official
he
wanted
to
ask
a
thousand
questions
but
he
knew
that
even
if
the
ammidons
were
too
dense
to
grasp
his
curiosity
taou
yuen
herself
would
comprehend
his
impoliteness
nowhere
else
could
be
found
the
wisdom
and
poise
of
a
manchu
lady
jeremy
ammidon
in
a
lawn
chair
a
smoking
cheroot
in
his
fingers
asked
him
about
affairs
of
chinese
government
and
commerce
as
the
old
man
talked
he
flushed
darkly
with
quick
indignation
the
english
have
made
our
political
diplomats
look
like
stuffed
gulls
he
declared
look
at
their
orders
in
council
and
the
british
prize
courts
he
proceeded
waving
his
cheroot
stop
an
american
vessel
anywhere
and
pretend
to
find
a
deserting
english
sailor
with
the
treaty
of
ghent
and
commissioners
and
a
congress
that
would
know
a
ship
from
a
bread
barge
the
country
going
to
hell
on
greased
ways
i
said
it
a
thousand
times
and
any
man
not
a
complete
ass
knows
that
you
ca
run
a
government
without
a
strong
head
locofocos
he
muttered
edward
dunsack
listened
to
this
tirade
with
an
air
of
polite
attention
which
hid
completely
the
fact
that
he
heard
or
comprehended
scarcely
a
word
his
thoughts
were
filled
by
the
fragrant
vision
of
taou
yuen
already
he
was
deep
in
the
problem
of
how
to
see
her
again
it
would
be
excessively
difficult
eastern
women
never
if
they
could
avoid
it
walked
and
they
were
he
knew
entirely
without
the
necessity
that
drove
the
women
of
salem
into
a
ceaseless
round
of
calling
and
gossip
it
was
probable
that
except
to
ride
she
would
leave
the
house
and
grounds
he
cursed
the
chance
quarrel
that
had
set
a
customary
void
between
the
houses
of
dunsack
and
ammidon
the
unfortunate
affair
of
his
sister
and
vollar
inescapably
adding
to
the
permanency
of
the
breach
he
particularly
cursed
nettie
there
however
his
mind
took
up
the
twisted
thread
of
the
vague
possibility
that
the
latter
might
be
useful
to
him
he
was
amazed
at
the
way
in
which
his
premonitions
fitted
into
the
pattern
of
situations
yet
to
be
materialized
edward
dunsack
turned
from
his
contemplation
of
taou
yuen
to
a
careful
consideration
of
gerrit
ammidon
the
latter
had
a
countenance
which
showed
strong
easily
summoned
emotions
it
was
an
intolerant
face
dunsack
judged
and
yet
sentimental
and
it
was
surprisingly
young
guileless
at
the
same
time
it
was
unusually
determined
an
affair
of
uncomplicated
surfaces
direct
gaze
marked
bone
he
questioned
sharply
irritably
the
length
to
which
his
projections
had
reached
what
were
they
all
about
the
answer
was
presented
by
the
glittering
figure
of
the
manchu
she
had
risen
and
was
standing
in
the
entrance
of
the
summerhouse
he
thought
with
a
jerking
pulse
of
oriental
similes
she
was
a
a
green
slip
of
willow
an
ambrosial
moon
a
mustard
flower
her
teeth
were
white
buds
her
breasts
blanched
almonds
his
entire
life
in
china
had
been
a
preparation
for
the
realization
of
the
present
moment
the
sense
of
danger
of
anger
at
gerrit
ammidon
perished
before
the
supreme
emotion
called
up
by
taou
yuen
he
wanted
to
embrace
her
feet
to
cling
to
her
odorous
hands
such
hands
as
were
never
formed
out
of
china
like
petals
of
coral
not
only
her
bodily
charm
intoxicated
him
but
the
thought
of
her
subtle
mind
added
its
attraction
its
shadows
never
to
be
pierced
by
the
blunted
western
instinct
the
knowledge
of
pleasures
like
perfumes
the
calm
blend
of
the
eight
diagrams
of
confucius
the
stoicism
of
the
buddhistic
soul
revolving
perpetually
in
the
urn
of
fate
and
of
the
aloof
tao
of
brevard
left
with
an
easy
familiarity
already
planning
a
return
that
filled
edward
dunsack
with
resentful
envy
the
sun
had
disappeared
behind
the
house
long
cool
shadows
swept
down
the
garden
it
was
past
time
for
him
to
go
a
reluctance
to
move
from
the
magic
of
taou
yuen
possessed
him
he
was
unable
to
think
how
when
he
would
next
see
her
he
raged
at
the
prohibition
against
speaking
chinese
that
ability
should
give
him
an
overwhelming
advantage
of
gerrit
ammidon
this
was
of
course
the
reason
that
he
had
been
virtually
commanded
to
limit
himself
to
english
many
of
the
forms
of
extreme
chinese
courtesy
were
impossible
to
express
in
another
language
finally
he
rose
in
departing
he
emphasized
the
importance
of
jeremy
ammidon
taou
yuen
should
recognize
and
applaud
that
he
saw
that
she
was
watching
him
obliquely
her
lips
in
repose
her
hands
still
among
the
satin
draperies
an
american
would
have
betrayed
something
of
her
reaction
to
him
he
could
have
discovered
a
trace
an
indication
of
her
thoughts
but
the
manchu
face
was
as
inscrutable
as
porcelain
william
ammidon
nodded
the
old
man
responded
to
his
with
a
degree
of
warmness
gerrit
at
least
smiled
in
a
not
unfriendly
manner
edward
dunsack
bowed
to
taou
yuen
and
she
gravely
inclined
her
head
he
had
a
last
glimpse
of
her
glowing
in
the
green
light
of
the
inclosure
of
and
poplars
emerald
sod
and
tangled
lilac
trees
at
the
supper
table
his
sister
appearance
in
somber
untidy
black
barége
nettie
unrestrained
gestures
and
speech
the
coarse
red
cloth
and
plain
boiled
fare
all
added
to
a
discontent
that
he
could
scarcely
restrain
with
the
utmost
discrimination
in
delicate
shades
of
beauty
and
luxury
he
was
yet
condemned
to
spend
his
days
in
surroundings
hardly
raised
above
squalor
incongruous
as
it
was
he
could
yet
imagine
taou
yuen
moving
with
a
certain
appropriateness
about
the
ammidons
spacious
grounds
and
house
but
he
was
absolutely
unable
to
picture
her
here
on
hardy
street
all
the
vivid
scenes
that
continually
formed
and
shifted
in
his
mind
gathered
about
gerrit
ammidon
wife
he
used
this
phrase
in
a
contemptuously
satirical
manner
it
was
impossible
for
ammidon
actually
to
marry
a
manchu
such
racial
mating
he
told
himself
could
not
be
consummated
there
were
too
many
deep
antipathies
of
flesh
and
spirit
the
man
was
too
too
stupidly
normal
sooner
or
later
he
would
swing
back
to
his
own
with
him
edward
dunsack
it
was
different
he
always
had
an
inner
kinship
with
china
at
first
sight
its
streets
and
sounds
odors
and
ways
had
seemed
familiar
admirable
the
realization
of
this
when
his
place
with
heard
and
company
collapsed
had
sent
him
back
to
america
in
a
strange
dread
he
remembered
how
the
vague
fear
had
followed
him
to
derby
wharf
now
he
laughed
at
it
welcoming
every
chinese
instinct
he
had
they
seemed
to
throw
a
bridge
across
enormous
difficulties
bringing
him
finally
to
taou
yuen
he
lingered
at
the
table
after
supper
his
head
sunk
on
his
chest
revolving
the
various
aspects
of
his
position
one
thing
was
definite
he
must
have
taou
yuen
it
was
unthinkable
that
she
should
continue
with
gerrit
ammidon
it
needed
skillful
planning
tortuous
execution
but
in
the
end
he
get
his
desire
he
had
no
doubt
of
that
it
was
necessary
if
she
opposed
him
she
would
discover
that
he
too
could
be
subtle
oriental
yes
dangerous
none
of
the
stupid
inhibitions
that
for
example
bound
his
father
interfered
with
the
free
exercise
of
his
personal
wishes
he
was
beyond
primitive
morality
an
ecstasy
of
contemplation
ravished
his
senses
goodness
uncle
edward
nettie
exclaimed
you
scared
me
you
looked
so
like
a
chinee
there
are
no
such
people
he
retorted
sharply
exasperated
by
the
vulgar
error
she
was
undismayed
and
when
in
reply
to
the
question
she
learned
that
he
had
been
at
the
ammidons
her
surprise
increased
his
irritation
he
saw
from
her
manner
that
his
calling
there
had
been
at
least
unexpected
nettie
interrupted
the
preparation
of
the
table
for
breakfast
and
dropped
into
a
chair
beyond
him
her
hands
the
sleeves
were
rolled
back
to
her
elbows
clasped
before
her
you
must
tell
me
everything
she
declared
eagerly
what
is
she
like
do
they
seem
happy
did
he
hold
her
hand
do
chinese
women
kiss
is
she
tall
or
i
ca
remember
a
question
out
of
your
rattle
he
interrupted
her
he
was
about
to
give
expression
to
his
admiration
for
taou
yuen
when
he
stopped
with
tight
lips
here
perhaps
was
the
lever
by
which
so
much
was
to
be
shifted
she
chinese
he
said
indifferently
and
that
means
yellow
nettie
made
a
gesture
of
distaste
they
seem
to
get
along
well
enough
of
course
it
ridiculous
to
call
it
a
marriage
and
it
seems
to
me
very
questionable
to
impose
it
on
the
ammidons
as
that
the
thing
is
how
long
will
it
last
how
soon
will
he
get
tired
of
her
and
send
her
back
to
canton
nettie
vollar
closed
her
eyes
her
hands
were
rigid
the
lamplight
streaming
up
over
her
face
showed
him
that
it
was
tense
and
pale
and
answered
a
question
her
feeling
for
gerrit
ammidon
had
been
more
than
a
mere
hurt
pride
in
addition
to
that
he
saw
beyond
any
doubt
the
proof
of
its
existence
still
this
complicated
his
problem
inspired
only
by
a
resentment
that
he
might
fan
into
hatred
she
would
be
far
more
pliable
than
in
the
grip
of
a
genuine
affection
for
gerrit
ammidon
he
understood
the
processes
of
the
former
a
flexible
and
useful
steel
but
no
one
could
predict
the
vagaries
the
absurd
of
love
well
he
have
to
work
with
what
offered
that
he
realized
was
the
strength
of
his
philosophy
he
accepted
promptly
without
vain
regret
the
means
that
lay
at
his
hand
ammidon
seems
worn
he
said
generally
they
were
in
the
garden
and
i
had
a
few
words
privately
with
him
nettie
glanced
swiftly
across
the
table
her
lips
moved
but
she
repressed
the
obvious
question
trembling
on
them
he
showed
i
think
he
continued
carefully
a
very
improper
interest
in
you
how
he
asked
if
you
were
well
and
happy
i
most
certainly
told
him
for
any
number
of
reasons
for
pride
alone
that
you
were
then
you
told
a
lie
she
cried
in
a
tone
so
hard
that
it
surprised
him
of
course
he
went
on
smoothly
i
know
that
you
are
not
almost
all
your
circumstances
prohibit
that
but
i
do
intend
to
circulate
it
in
salem
opinion
here
may
have
forced
you
into
a
long
loneliness
but
i
sha
give
anyone
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
it
and
after
all
you
have
your
grandfather
mostly
to
blame
you
would
have
been
married
to
gerrit
ammidon
now
if
he
had
interfered
you
would
have
been
walking
about
the
ammidons
garden
with
your
hand
on
his
arm
in
place
of
that
chinese
prostitute
i
do
see
why
you
should
make
me
so
miserable
she
declared
i
care
anything
about
the
garden
it
is
that
why
do
you
suppose
he
brought
such
a
woman
home
pique
he
told
her
he
could
care
for
her
in
the
way
he
might
for
well
you
as
i
said
he
drop
her
on
his
next
voyage
to
the
east
he
will
leave
her
and
probably
never
come
back
to
salem
again
i
hear
that
ammidon
ammidon
and
saltonstone
are
planning
a
new
policy
bigger
ships
clippers
in
the
china
and
california
trade
and
that
means
removal
to
boston
their
facilities
here
are
no
longer
suitable
she
moved
her
chin
fell
upon
her
hands
propped
up
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
apparently
edward
dunsack
was
gazing
at
the
wall
beyond
her
her
breast
gave
a
single
sharp
heave
when
nettie
looked
up
her
face
was
flushed
i
wish
that
i
were
really
a
bad
woman
she
spoke
in
a
low
vibrant
voice
what
is
bad
and
what
is
good
he
still
seemed
to
ignore
her
considering
a
question
that
had
no
personal
bearing
in
one
country
a
thing
is
thought
wrong
and
in
another
it
is
the
highest
virtue
in
one
age
this
or
that
is
condemned
when
turn
the
calendar
and
everyone
is
praising
it
he
became
confidential
the
image
of
kindness
i
tell
you
what
i
think
is
wicked
he
pronounced
leaning
toward
her
and
that
is
the
way
you
two
were
kept
apart
unchristian
is
what
i
call
it
gerrit
does
care
she
said
how
do
you
know
he
demanded
i
can
not
agree
with
you
i
do
find
a
great
deal
in
him
to
admire
he
is
too
simple
and
transparent
but
there
no
doubt
of
this
he
is
faithful
one
idea
one
affection
is
all
his
head
will
hold
that
a
beautiful
trait
a
palpable
wistfulness
settled
over
her
it
greatly
admired
he
agreed
although
not
by
me
i
believe
in
taking
what
is
yours
what
you
need
from
life
i
suppose
that
i
have
been
away
from
proprieties
so
long
that
they
have
lost
their
importance
they
seem
to
me
of
no
greater
weight
than
barriers
of
straw
but
of
course
that
might
suit
you
probably
living
in
salem
as
you
have
its
opinion
is
valuable
salem
she
exclaimed
bitterly
what
has
it
ever
been
to
me
but
an
unfair
judgment
i
owe
salem
no
consideration
i
ca
see
that
i
owe
any
to
life
i
do
want
to
insist
on
that
he
proceeded
deliberately
the
tragedy
of
your
position
is
that
married
to
ammidon
everything
in
the
past
would
have
been
overlooked
forgotten
even
now
he
stopped
with
a
gesture
indicating
the
presence
still
of
large
possibilities
god
what
a
vacillating
fool
the
girl
was
he
could
say
no
more
at
present
and
he
rose
leaving
the
room
with
nettie
staring
dully
across
the
table
he
went
outside
to
the
grass
fronting
on
the
harbor
here
last
night
he
had
thrown
the
opium
into
the
water
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
lived
through
a
complete
existence
since
then
the
presence
of
taou
yuen
had
created
a
new
world
he
thought
she
walked
to
him
through
the
gloom
he
saw
her
slender
body
grow
brighter
as
she
approached
he
heard
her
speak
in
a
low
native
murmur
their
hands
caught
in
an
eager
tangle
he
put
aside
momentarily
the
problem
of
the
difficulties
of
going
again
to
the
ammidons
for
an
easier
one
the
bringing
of
gerrit
ammidon
here
he
was
confident
that
thrown
together
on
the
still
rim
of
the
water
at
evening
the
emotion
born
between
his
niece
and
the
shipmaster
and
prematurely
choked
would
revive
he
had
no
means
of
knowing
present
exact
feeling
for
nettie
he
was
counting
only
on
a
general
theory
of
men
and
nature
at
large
he
was
already
convinced
from
very
wide
knowledge
experience
that
the
other
could
not
form
a
permanent
attachment
to
the
manchu
and
nettie
great
difference
together
with
the
romance
of
her
unhappy
position
must
have
a
potent
effect
on
the
fellow
evident
sentimentality
a
dank
air
rose
from
the
water
like
the
smell
of
death
and
with
an
uncontrollable
shiver
he
turned
back
toward
the
house
in
his
room
edward
dunsack
recalled
that
he
had
promised
himself
to
throw
away
the
remainder
of
the
opium
on
this
and
succeeding
nights
in
view
of
that
his
movements
were
inexplicable
he
got
out
from
a
locked
chest
the
a
heavy
tube
of
dark
wood
inlaid
with
silver
ideograms
and
diminutive
earthen
cup
at
one
end
then
he
produced
a
small
brass
lamp
brushes
long
needles
and
a
metal
rod
taking
off
his
clothes
and
in
the
somber
black
folds
of
the
silk
robe
he
made
various
minutely
careful
preparations
finally
extended
on
his
bed
he
dipped
the
end
of
the
rod
into
opium
the
color
of
tar
kept
it
for
a
bubbling
moment
near
the
blaze
of
the
lamp
and
then
crowded
the
drug
into
the
pipe
he
held
the
bowl
to
the
flame
and
drew
in
a
long
deep
inhalation
a
second
followed
and
the
pipe
was
empty
he
repeated
this
until
he
had
smoked
a
mace
a
vivacious
and
brilliant
state
of
being
flooded
him
he
felt
capable
of
profoundly
witty
conversation
and
laughed
at
the
solemn
absurdities
of
the
ammidons
at
his
father
attempting
to
call
down
a
blessing
out
of
the
empty
sky
upon
their
food
at
his
sister
lugubrious
countenance
the
childish
emotions
of
nettie
what
a
nonsensical
strutting
business
life
was
the
confines
of
his
room
were
lost
in
an
amber
radiance
that
filled
all
space
it
was
at
once
a
light
and
a
perfume
and
charged
with
a
sense
of
impending
rapture
a
sparkling
crimson
shape
floated
down
from
infinite
skies
taou
yuen
she
wore
a
bridal
costume
cunningly
embroidered
with
the
phoenix
a
hood
of
thin
gold
plate
and
a
band
of
red
silk
about
her
brow
bore
the
eight
copper
figures
of
the
beings
who
are
immortal
her
hair
was
ornamented
by
the
pure
green
jade
pins
of
summer
her
hanging
wrists
were
heavy
with
virgin
silver
while
her
face
was
like
the
desirous
august
moon
flushed
in
low
vapors
he
raised
his
bony
arms
the
wide
silk
sleeves
falling
back
his
emaciated
yellow
hands
from
under
his
dark
eyelids
there
was
a
glitter
of
vision
like
the
sheen
on
mica
taou
yuen
floated
nearer
edward
dunsack
woke
suddenly
at
the
darkest
ebb
of
night
and
started
hurriedly
to
his
feet
a
sickening
vertigo
a
whirling
head
sent
him
lurching
across
the
room
he
came
in
contact
with
a
chest
of
drawers
and
clung
to
it
with
the
feeling
that
his
legs
were
shriveling
beneath
him
his
consciousness
slowly
returned
and
with
it
a
pain
like
ruthless
tearing
fingers
searched
his
body
the
rectangle
of
the
open
window
only
less
dark
than
the
room
promised
a
relief
from
the
strangled
effort
of
his
breathing
and
he
fell
across
the
ledge
lifting
his
face
to
a
starless
and
unstirring
heat
waves
of
complete
physical
exhaustion
passed
over
him
an
utter
horror
fastened
on
his
brain
oh
god
he
said
with
numb
lips
we
thank
thee
for
this
thy
daily
blessing
he
broke
off
with
an
effort
that
was
his
father
pronouncing
a
grace
oh
god
he
said
again
when
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
the
darkness
he
saw
the
blank
placidity
of
a
buddha
carved
from
gray
stone
tears
ran
over
his
sunken
cheeks
salt
and
warm
like
blood
vi
the
night
was
so
oppressive
continuing
such
an
unusually
sultry
period
for
the
season
that
sidsall
ordinarily
impervious
to
the
effects
of
weather
was
unable
to
sleep
although
the
door
between
her
room
and
her
parents
was
shut
she
heard
her
father
his
step
at
once
quick
and
firm
was
easily
recognizable
moving
about
beyond
her
restlessness
increased
and
she
got
up
crossing
the
floor
to
the
window
open
on
the
garden
where
she
knelt
the
thick
plait
of
her
hair
across
her
cheek
and
shoulder
with
her
arms
propped
on
the
ledge
the
depths
of
sky
were
hidden
in
a
darkness
like
night
made
visible
and
in
place
of
moving
air
there
were
slow
waves
of
perfume
now
from
the
lilacs
and
now
from
the
opening
hedge
of
june
roses
her
brain
was
filled
by
a
multitude
of
minor
images
and
speculations
but
fixed
at
their
back
was
the
presence
of
roger
brevard
she
approved
of
him
absolutely
he
had
exactly
the
formal
manner
that
gave
her
a
pleasant
sense
of
delicate
importance
and
his
clothes
were
beautiful
a
sprig
of
rose
geranium
in
a
buttonhole
and
his
gloves
and
boots
immaculate
she
liked
rather
slight
graceful
men
she
thought
with
the
quiet
voices
of
a
polite
ancestry
naturally
olive
wibird
preferred
less
restrained
companions
although
heaven
knew
that
olive
appeared
to
make
all
kinds
welcome
olive
opinion
of
roger
brevard
would
have
been
very
different
if
he
had
asked
her
to
dance
sidsall
recalled
the
quadrille
he
had
led
her
through
at
lacy
party
he
had
been
a
perfect
partner
at
once
light
and
firm
he
had
been
a
habitual
caller
at
java
head
before
that
occasion
and
had
come
in
the
same
manner
since
that
is
casually
viewed
his
visits
seemed
the
same
but
in
reality
there
were
some
small
yet
significant
differences
they
were
all
held
in
his
attitude
of
the
afternoon
when
he
had
stayed
talking
exclusively
to
her
on
the
steps
she
could
say
just
what
the
change
was
when
she
attempted
to
examine
it
her
thoughts
became
confused
and
turned
to
a
hundred
absurd
considerations
such
as
at
present
the
loveliness
of
the
night
the
scents
of
the
flowers
were
overwhelming
he
got
on
too
better
than
almost
anyone
else
with
her
uncle
gerrit
manchu
wife
she
had
watched
them
together
until
it
had
dawned
on
her
that
the
two
had
some
important
qualities
in
common
they
both
appeared
to
stand
a
little
aside
from
the
world
as
if
they
were
against
the
wall
at
a
cotillion
she
thought
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
precisely
what
roger
brevard
never
did
it
was
true
in
the
mysterious
way
of
so
much
now
that
came
from
ideas
over
which
she
had
no
control
the
subject
of
uncle
gerrit
wife
she
had
not
yet
been
told
or
decided
for
herself
what
to
call
her
was
inexhaustibly
enthralling
but
before
she
was
again
fairly
launched
in
it
she
paused
to
wonder
at
the
presence
of
the
dreadful
dunsack
man
on
their
lawn
his
hollow
yellow
cheeks
and
staring
brown
eyes
which
somehow
made
her
think
of
pain
his
restless
hands
and
speech
all
repelled
her
violently
taou
taou
yuen
liked
him
either
when
after
the
longest
time
he
had
gone
she
replied
to
a
short
comment
from
her
sidsall
father
rotten
wood
can
not
be
carved
some
one
else
had
mentioned
opium
she
had
intended
to
ask
more
particularly
about
this
but
it
slipped
from
her
mind
she
remembered
that
her
grandfather
made
one
of
his
familiar
exclamations
peppered
with
an
appalling
word
he
was
really
very
embarrassing
and
she
was
glad
that
roger
brevard
had
left
it
was
a
bad
example
for
laurel
too
who
copied
him
and
only
that
morning
said
my
god
to
miss
gomes
her
mind
swung
back
to
the
consideration
of
the
manchu
the
latter
was
the
fact
upon
which
camilla
was
so
insistent
that
in
this
case
a
manchu
was
a
noble
almost
a
princess
camilla
suffered
dreadfully
from
the
endless
questions
put
to
her
outside
their
house
about
uncle
gerrit
wife
she
had
more
than
once
wept
at
the
public
blot
laid
on
them
laurel
was
frankly
inquisitive
and
janet
as
puzzling
as
usual
the
clothes
of
course
were
enchanting
the
richness
of
the
materials
and
hand
embroidery
marvellous
her
jewelry
was
never
ending
it
did
seem
quite
like
clothing
in
the
sense
of
her
own
tarlatan
and
crinoline
her
waist
which
hodie
would
properly
lace
and
tulle
draping
there
was
a
certain
resemblance
to
the
dressing
in
van
amburgh
circus
but
in
spite
of
camilla
private
laments
every
inch
of
it
was
distinguished
the
layers
of
paint
upset
them
but
uncle
gerrit
had
explained
a
little
impatiently
that
it
was
a
manchu
custom
adding
that
the
world
be
all
measured
and
judged
by
salem
sidsall
liked
her
rather
than
not
she
decided
and
determined
to
make
an
effort
to
know
her
better
she
wanted
specially
to
discover
the
nature
of
the
bond
that
held
one
to
the
other
and
explore
in
safety
the
depths
of
love
she
could
not
help
feeling
that
her
uncle
affair
extraordinary
as
it
was
must
throw
light
on
the
whole
complicated
business
of
marriage
the
clock
in
the
hall
struck
an
indeterminate
half
hour
it
appeared
to
grow
lighter
outside
and
there
was
a
twittering
of
martins
from
the
stables
from
above
came
the
vigorous
harsh
cawing
of
crows
suddenly
sleepy
she
returned
to
bed
and
almost
immediately
the
room
was
flooded
with
sunlight
it
was
an
accepted
fact
now
that
taou
yuen
the
garden
of
peaches
stayed
in
her
room
until
long
after
breakfast
and
when
sidsall
rising
from
the
table
found
a
servant
taking
up
a
pot
of
hot
water
for
tea
she
secured
it
and
knocked
carefully
on
the
door
above
the
slurring
hesitating
voice
said
come
in
and
she
entered
with
a
diffidence
covered
by
a
cheerfully
polite
morning
greeting
she
found
the
other
in
crêpe
de
chine
pantaloons
wrapped
tightly
about
her
ankles
and
bound
over
quilted
muslin
socks
with
gay
brocaded
ribbons
and
a
short
floating
gown
of
gray
silk
worked
with
willow
leaves
her
hair
was
an
undisturbed
complication
of
lustrous
black
gold
bodkins
and
flowers
massed
on
either
side
and
her
face
without
paint
or
powder
was
as
smooth
as
ivory
and
the
color
of
very
pale
coffee
and
cream
sidsall
saw
that
she
was
at
her
toilet
and
she
put
down
the
pot
of
steaming
water
moving
toward
the
door
but
taou
yuen
with
a
charmingly
shy
gesture
begged
her
to
stay
she
swiftly
drew
a
cup
of
tea
from
silvery
leaves
filled
and
lighted
the
minute
bowl
of
her
tobacco
pipe
deeply
inhaled
the
smoke
then
returned
to
a
mirror
fascinated
sidsall
followed
every
motion
taou
yuen
polished
her
face
sharply
with
a
hot
damp
cloth
and
then
dipped
her
fingers
in
a
jar
that
held
a
sticky
amber
substance
honey
she
said
briefly
rubbing
it
into
her
cheeks
and
palms
next
she
attacked
her
eyebrows
and
skillfully
wielding
a
thin
silk
cord
left
arches
like
pencil
markings
at
times
she
interrupted
her
preparations
to
turn
to
sidsall
with
a
little
smile
so
engaging
that
the
girl
smiled
sympathetically
in
answer
there
were
a
gilt
paper
box
of
rice
powder
with
which
she
drenched
her
countenance
leaves
of
carmine
transferred
to
her
cheeks
with
a
wet
finger
and
a
silver
pot
of
rouge
from
which
she
coated
her
lips
as
she
gazed
approvingly
at
her
reflection
sidsall
said
it
very
beautiful
her
eyes
drawn
up
toward
her
temples
shone
gayly
and
close
to
sidsall
she
touched
the
latter
affectionately
on
the
cheek
the
cold
sharp
contact
of
the
long
curving
finger
guard
gave
the
girl
an
unpleasant
shock
it
seemed
lifeless
or
like
the
scratching
of
a
beetle
suddenly
the
woman
glittering
gaze
her
expressionless
face
stiff
with
paint
the
blaze
of
her
barbaric
colors
filled
sidsall
with
a
shrinking
that
was
almost
dread
she
was
even
more
oppressed
by
an
instinctive
feeling
of
what
she
could
express
to
herself
only
as
cruelty
hidden
under
the
other
scented
embroidery
at
the
same
time
her
curiosity
persisted
conquered
she
was
unable
however
to
think
of
any
possible
manner
of
introducing
the
new
subject
of
her
interest
love
and
was
forced
to
be
content
with
an
indifferent
opening
we
were
all
quite
surprised
when
dunsack
called
yesterday
she
said
he
is
in
the
least
a
friend
of
the
family
grandfather
went
to
sea
with
his
father
but
even
they
did
speak
for
years
in
salem
the
dunsacks
are
a
little
common
i
know
taou
yuen
replied
dunsack
a
long
time
in
canton
at
the
american
agents
china
is
bad
for
men
like
him
black
spirits
get
in
them
and
the
ten
sins
he
stared
at
you
in
the
rudest
way
he
never
saw
a
manchu
lady
before
in
china
the
dog
would
not
have
passed
by
the
first
gate
here
it
is
nothing
to
be
a
manchu
or
an
honorable
wife
it
is
all
like
the
tea
houses
and
rice
villages
men
walk
up
to
you
with
bold
eyes
i
tell
gerrit
and
he
laughs
i
stay
in
the
room
and
he
brings
me
shamefully
down
this
dunsack
comes
and
the
wise
old
man
talks
to
him
like
a
son
he
touches
your
mother
hand
he
sees
the
young
girls
like
white
candles
we
would
let
him
really
bother
us
sidsall
explained
probably
if
he
comes
again
we
all
be
out
taou
yuen
made
a
comment
in
chinese
a
bad
thought
is
a
secret
knife
she
continued
it
is
more
dangerous
than
the
anger
of
the
emperor
a
sickness
that
kills
with
the
stink
of
bodies
already
dead
this
seemed
rather
absurd
to
sidsall
she
considered
once
more
the
introduction
of
the
subject
of
her
new
concern
but
in
spite
of
taou
yuen
extravagant
appearance
there
was
a
quality
of
being
which
made
impossible
any
blunt
interrogation
she
had
a
decidedly
aloof
manner
her
mother
sidsall
recognized
and
the
older
women
they
knew
had
a
trace
of
this
but
in
the
manchu
it
was
carried
infinitely
further
a
most
autocratic
disdain
her
feeling
for
the
other
shifted
rapidly
from
attitude
to
attitude
she
watched
she
was
certain
these
same
sensations
come
over
her
aunt
caroline
saltonstone
clifford
and
wibird
who
called
on
gerrit
ammidon
wife
that
afternoon
they
were
sitting
with
their
crinoline
widespread
against
their
chairs
gazing
with
a
concerted
battery
of
curiosity
at
taou
yuen
shimmering
figure
in
the
screened
against
the
sun
wibird
sidsall
thought
a
woman
of
fat
and
faded
prettiness
with
wine
red
splotches
beneath
her
eyes
and
a
voice
that
went
on
and
on
in
the
relating
of
various
petty
emotional
disturbances
must
have
resembled
olive
as
a
girl
it
was
probable
then
that
olive
would
look
like
her
mother
when
in
turn
she
was
clifford
unseasonably
huddled
in
her
perpetual
shawl
more
than
ever
suggested
a
haggard
marble
in
somberly
rich
clothes
aunt
caroline
sat
with
complacent
hands
and
loud
inattentive
speech
taou
yuen
smiled
at
them
placidly
our
men
said
clifford
went
out
to
china
for
years
it
never
occurred
to
them
however
to
marry
a
chinese
woman
but
i
dare
say
they
did
see
the
right
sort
most
of
the
captains
like
china
taou
yuen
said
they
are
so
far
away
from
their
families
she
made
a
brief
philosophical
gesture
and
madra
clifford
studied
her
with
a
narrowed
gaze
it
would
be
the
same
she
continued
if
chinamen
came
to
america
wibird
shuddered
a
yellow
skin
she
cried
impetuously
i
ca
bide
the
thought
i
sure
we
be
tremendously
interested
saltonstone
hurriedly
put
in
if
you
tell
us
about
your
wedding
a
chinese
wedding
must
be
be
very
gay
with
firecrackers
and
my
marriage
with
captain
ammidon
was
not
beautiful
i
was
a
widow
and
he
foreign
the
manchu
wedding
is
very
nice
first
there
is
the
engagement
ceremony
i
sit
like
this
she
sank
gracefully
to
the
floor
on
the
bed
with
my
eyes
shut
and
if
i
am
noble
two
princesses
come
and
put
the
it
jade
and
means
all
joy
on
my
lap
two
little
silk
bags
hang
from
the
buttons
of
my
gown
with
gold
coins
and
two
gold
rings
on
my
fingers
must
be
marked
with
that
great
happiness
i
told
polygamy
is
an
active
practice
wibird
remarked
with
a
rising
interest
yes
taou
yuen
asked
one
man
a
lot
of
wives
the
emperor
has
a
great
many
and
some
manchus
take
a
second
and
third
you
think
that
is
wrong
here
who
knows
the
chinese
women
are
very
good
very
modest
the
four
books
for
girls
teach
perfect
submission
the
five
virtues
are
benevolence
righteousness
propriety
wisdom
sincerity
confucius
says
root
is
filial
piety
very
admirable
wibird
nodded
agitating
the
small
dyed
ostrich
plumes
tipped
with
marabou
of
her
bonnet
but
it
was
clear
to
sidsall
that
this
was
not
the
revelation
for
which
she
had
hoped
a
momentary
silence
the
edge
of
an
uneasiness
enveloped
the
visitors
what
lovely
satins
saltonstone
commented
please
i
have
a
box
full
you
will
let
me
give
you
some
indeed
yes
and
thank
you
wibird
growing
resentful
said
that
a
cousin
of
her
aunt
had
been
a
missionary
to
china
and
did
a
very
blessed
work
too
taou
yuen
smoothly
agreed
that
it
was
quite
possible
our
poor
have
a
great
many
wrong
and
lustful
ideas
she
acknowledged
they
tell
lies
and
beat
their
wives
and
gamble
the
higher
classes
too
the
mandarins
and
princes
use
the
people
for
their
own
security
and
rob
them
sometimes
the
law
is
not
honest
and
a
man
with
gold
gets
free
when
a
laborer
is
put
in
the
bamboo
cage
clifford
said
very
vigorously
ha
the
silence
returned
intensified
i
remember
the
manchu
went
on
this
will
amuse
you
my
who
was
in
the
canton
customs
told
me
that
some
boxes
of
bibles
came
out
from
america
with
other
objects
and
when
they
were
opened
at
the
mission
they
were
the
wrong
ones
and
filled
with
rum
there
was
not
however
any
marked
appreciation
of
this
on
the
part
of
the
salem
women
they
rose
to
leave
and
taou
yuen
sank
on
her
knee
she
gazed
without
a
trace
of
emotion
at
the
three
flooding
the
door
with
their
belled
skirts
they
are
the
same
everywhere
she
told
the
girl
the
latter
moved
out
into
the
garden
there
she
subconsciously
picked
a
rose
and
fastened
it
in
her
hair
her
thoughts
turned
to
roger
brevard
in
his
place
her
uncle
gerrit
came
out
through
the
window
the
usual
shadow
of
the
house
lengthening
with
afternoon
was
pleasantly
enveloping
and
they
walked
slowly
over
the
grass
a
flower
in
your
hair
he
said
and
by
yourself
you
have
been
thinking
about
true
love
she
blushed
vividly
at
this
unexpected
angle
on
her
mind
and
found
it
impossible
to
meet
his
keen
blue
eyes
love
must
be
a
remarkable
thing
she
raised
a
swift
glance
to
his
face
and
discovered
that
he
had
not
spoken
to
her
at
all
but
hat
in
hand
was
looking
away
with
an
expression
of
abstraction
i
mean
the
unreasonable
silly
divine
kind
he
specified
now
gazing
at
her
quizzically
as
if
lost
in
a
mood
over
which
he
had
no
control
the
sort
that
is
as
long
as
life
and
stronger
it
is
entirely
different
and
ages
older
than
the
reasonable
logical
love
all
proper
and
suitable
and
civilized
or
the
love
that
is
the
result
of
a
determination
the
result
of
a
determination
he
repeated
frowning
darkly
at
their
feet
sidsall
held
her
breath
thrilled
by
the
wealth
of
what
she
had
heard
fearful
of
diverting
what
might
be
yet
revealed
but
he
moved
away
abruptly
in
a
manner
that
enforced
solitude
and
stood
apparently
examining
the
rockery
her
brain
rang
with
the
splendid
phrase
love
as
long
as
life
and
stronger
it
seemed
to
clarify
and
state
so
much
of
her
lately
confused
being
hodie
artfully
drawn
into
the
consideration
of
earthly
affection
was
far
less
satisfactory
than
gerrit
ammidon
she
dwelt
on
the
treasure
beyond
moth
or
rust
lost
in
an
ecstasy
of
contemplation
expressed
in
her
customary
explosive
amens
at
the
same
time
she
admitted
that
lower
unions
were
blessed
of
god
and
recommended
sidsall
to
think
on
a
man
who
has
seen
the
light
and
by
no
means
a
sea
captain
sidsall
replied
cuttingly
i
think
you
must
forget
where
you
are
i
forget
nothing
hodie
stoutly
maintained
i
witness
before
anyone
she
settled
the
flounces
of
sidsall
skirt
with
a
deft
hand
walking
toward
the
saltonstones
for
tea
with
a
mulberry
silk
parasol
casting
a
shifting
glow
on
her
expanse
of
clear
madras
sidsall
wondered
at
the
sudden
change
of
almost
all
her
interests
and
preoccupations
it
was
very
disturbing
she
fell
into
daydreams
that
carried
her
fancy
away
on
a
search
that
was
a
longing
a
soft
confusion
of
opening
her
arms
to
mystery
this
varied
with
a
restless
melancholy
the
old
securities
of
her
life
were
hidden
in
a
mist
of
uncertainty
in
which
her
consciousness
was
troubled
by
nameless
pressures
something
within
her
held
almost
desperately
back
from
further
adventuring
but
all
the
time
a
latent
fascination
was
drawing
her
on
putting
aside
the
curtain
for
her
better
view
the
saltonstones
dwelling
on
chestnut
street
was
one
of
a
pair
a
large
solid
square
of
brick
with
two
identical
oval
white
porticoes
and
rows
of
windows
keyed
in
white
stone
within
the
staircase
swept
up
to
a
slender
pillared
opening
through
which
lacy
calmly
dressing
waved
a
deliberate
hand
saltonstone
was
seated
by
the
tall
gilt
framed
mirror
on
a
low
marble
stand
between
long
front
windows
as
usual
she
said
in
connection
with
her
daughter
lacy
as
cool
as
a
water
monkey
gets
it
from
james
they
would
hurry
if
she
searched
in
vain
for
an
expression
of
her
family
composure
now
i
am
an
impetuous
woman
she
promptly
exhibited
this
quality
in
the
vigor
with
which
she
met
the
wrong
canister
of
tea
brought
by
a
servant
she
did
intend
to
serve
padre
souchong
to
a
lot
of
people
who
apparently
confused
afternoon
tea
with
an
invitation
to
dinner
in
the
small
press
which
followed
sidsall
stopped
in
the
dining
room
with
lacy
and
olive
wibird
olive
was
still
discussing
men
he
sat
holding
my
hand
right
on
that
bench
by
your
hedge
sidsall
and
said
that
nothing
could
keep
him
from
coming
back
for
me
but
he
died
of
yellow
fever
in
batavia
she
left
in
the
company
of
a
beau
of
fifty
anyhow
with
a
glistening
bald
head
a
silly
smirking
bow
and
flood
of
compliments
lacy
moved
away
and
sidsall
found
herself
facing
roger
brevard
that
looks
remarkably
like
a
garden
he
said
waving
toward
an
open
door
the
sun
had
become
obscured
in
a
veil
of
cloud
drooping
until
it
almost
seemed
to
rest
on
the
bright
green
foliage
her
companion
mood
too
was
shadowed
i
thought
you
be
here
he
added
outside
and
looked
for
you
at
once
there
was
something
special
you
wanted
to
say
my
dear
child
he
replied
ca
you
guess
how
absolutely
refreshing
you
are
no
i
have
nothing
special
but
you
soon
get
used
to
men
around
with
no
more
reason
than
yourself
she
studied
this
seriously
and
as
its
complimentary
intent
emerged
a
corresponding
color
stained
her
cheeks
her
gaze
rested
on
him
for
the
fleetest
moment
possible
and
to
her
surprise
she
saw
that
he
was
frowning
i
came
here
just
to
see
you
no
he
corrected
his
period
only
to
see
you
his
manner
was
surprisingly
abrupt
and
disconcerting
i
can
quite
realize
he
went
on
that
i
should
say
any
of
this
yet
on
the
other
hand
it
is
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
i
have
been
listening
to
the
conventional
babble
of
teas
and
cotillions
for
so
long
that
you
are
like
a
breath
of
lost
youth
certainly
that
is
appropriate
i
think
he
told
her
that
you
are
the
youngest
thing
alive
then
he
laughed
so
young
that
i
have
annoyed
you
i
feel
a
great
deal
older
than
i
did
well
last
month
she
said
that
is
a
tragedy
she
felt
that
if
he
were
still
amused
at
her
she
was
furious
but
he
was
even
graver
than
before
to
tell
you
helps
hurry
the
charm
to
an
end
that
is
what
might
be
complained
against
me
yet
flowers
will
open
you
know
and
it
might
as
well
be
in
an
honest
sun
i
do
understand
she
admitted
troubled
why
it
means
sidsall
that
i
am
offering
you
an
experienced
hand
that
i
certain
i
can
do
you
more
good
than
harm
that
silly
she
interrupted
if
you
mean
that
we
might
be
friends
really
confidential
friends
it
would
help
me
awfully
but
then
it
so
you
have
to
overlook
that
he
answered
probably
all
that
i
can
give
you
experience
is
worth
the
smallest
of
your
feelings
probably
you
wo
need
me
for
an
instant
certainly
the
pleasure
will
be
mine
you
did
understand
she
told
him
with
dignity
it
the
other
way
round
i
am
not
a
particle
interesting
and
everyone
agrees
that
i
too
healthy
but
i
ca
help
it
if
my
cheeks
are
red
and
mother
wo
let
me
have
powder
it
was
obviously
impossible
to
explain
about
hodie
and
the
lacing
i
like
it
he
insisted
i
admit
that
i
am
unfashionable
there
i
think
we
hit
on
a
great
deal
to
share
privately
there
was
a
faint
patter
among
the
leaves
and
a
cold
drop
of
rain
fell
on
sidsall
arm
others
struck
roger
brevard
but
he
continued
without
apparently
noticing
them
you
must
understand
that
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
sometimes
although
they
wo
come
yet
there
are
things
a
a
friend
can
do
better
than
one
family
you
ask
me
sidsall
yes
she
said
solemnly
more
rain
struck
her
she
could
see
it
now
plainly
falling
between
them
roger
brevard
face
was
dark
the
frown
still
scarred
his
forehead
personally
she
was
happier
than
she
remembered
ever
being
before
and
she
wondered
at
his
severity
of
bearing
but
you
must
go
in
at
once
he
cried
suddenly
energetic
his
familiar
self
you
are
getting
wetter
every
minute
the
clouds
dissolved
into
a
late
sunlight
that
streamed
in
long
bars
through
the
canopies
of
elms
on
the
streets
from
her
windows
sidsall
saw
a
world
of
flashing
greenery
and
limpid
sky
usually
when
she
was
happy
she
sang
unimportant
bits
of
light
song
but
her
present
state
was
serious
and
inarticulate
the
indeterminate
questions
the
disturbing
vague
moods
of
the
past
days
somehow
combined
and
took
on
the
tangible
shape
of
roger
brevard
her
curiosity
about
love
was
resolved
into
a
sudden
inner
shrinking
from
its
possibilities
and
meaning
she
was
lost
in
her
aloofness
from
mundane
affairs
taou
yuen
in
whispering
silk
her
grandfather
rotund
tones
laurel
and
camilla
and
her
mother
were
distant
immaterial
in
the
evening
she
sat
on
the
front
steps
a
web
of
white
dreamily
intent
on
the
shimmering
sweep
of
washington
square
after
a
little
she
was
joined
by
gerrit
ammidon
he
wore
linen
trousers
and
a
short
blue
sea
jacket
and
the
wavering
delicately
lavender
trail
of
smoke
from
his
cheroot
was
like
her
floating
thoughts
already
he
said
i
am
full
of
getting
back
on
my
ship
she
smiled
at
him
absently
the
land
does
do
for
a
sailor
he
continued
they
are
always
into
trouble
on
shore
i
ca
say
why
it
should
be
so
but
it
is
if
not
one
kind
there
is
another
rum
and
such
varnish
for
the
able
seaman
and
and
complications
for
a
master
i
suppose
that
because
there
are
so
confounded
many
unexpected
currents
and
slants
of
wind
as
you
might
say
on
shipboard
everything
pretty
much
is
charted
a
thing
will
be
followed
more
or
less
by
a
fixed
consequence
the
waves
break
so
and
so
on
coral
or
rocks
or
sand
there
is
usually
the
sun
for
an
observation
a
good
man
knows
his
ship
how
many
points
she
hold
on
the
wind
how
a
cargo
must
be
stowed
when
to
take
in
the
light
canvas
you
can
give
the
man
at
the
wheel
a
course
and
turn
in
or
stay
on
deck
and
beat
your
way
through
hell
it
exact
you
know
but
on
shore
he
made
a
hopeless
gesture
there
are
no
regulations
he
observed
moodily
or
else
nobody
follows
them
collisions
all
the
time
sinkings
and
derelicts
drifting
round
awash
and
dismasted
but
they
are
everywhere
that
fellow
edward
dunsack
he
stopped
lost
in
speculation
then
he
seems
harmless
enough
he
resumed
even
pitiful
but
he
sticks
in
your
head
i
wish
i
never
brought
his
damned
chest
to
salem
a
fool
would
have
known
better
i
worse
a
childish
fool
a
derelict
he
said
again
you
are
smashing
over
a
swell
at
twelve
knots
or
more
everything
spread
when
in
a
hollow
there
it
is
squarely
across
your
bow
no
time
to
shift
the
wheel
and
a
ship
missing
perhaps
in
a
hundred
fathom
it
might
be
the
best
ship
afloat
the
best
master
and
stoutest
crew
but
in
a
minute
she
only
a
salty
tangle
he
laughed
uneasily
at
the
vividness
of
his
fancy
if
it
hard
for
us
what
must
it
be
for
taou
yuen
he
demanded
married
to
me
here
courage
for
you
he
tramped
down
the
steps
across
pleasant
street
with
his
bare
head
sunk
and
vanished
into
the
obscurity
of
the
square
she
caught
a
last
glimmer
of
white
trousers
a
faint
rapid
gleam
where
his
lighted
cheroot
described
the
arc
of
a
passionate
gesture
on
the
night
the
spring
like
the
full
buds
of
the
hedge
roses
in
the
garden
passed
swiftly
into
early
summer
the
flowers
against
the
house
showed
gay
perennial
colors
the
stocks
and
larkspur
and
snapdragons
succeeded
the
retreating
flood
of
the
lilacs
the
days
were
still
yellow
pools
of
heat
or
else
cooled
by
the
faintly
salt
sea
wind
drawing
down
the
elms
and
chestnuts
followed
by
nights
of
moonlight
they
seemed
to
sidsall
to
hold
everything
in
a
pause
she
saw
less
and
less
of
taou
yuen
who
now
scarcely
came
out
of
her
room
except
for
an
occasional
ride
in
the
barouche
with
ammidon
or
a
contemplative
hour
in
the
garden
usually
at
dusk
apparently
content
with
the
elaborate
rearrangement
of
her
headdress
she
sat
for
long
periods
gazing
out
over
washington
square
idle
except
for
the
regular
tap
of
her
pipe
emptying
the
ashes
of
the
minute
bowl
yet
sidsall
first
interest
in
her
had
almost
completely
shifted
to
gerrit
ammidon
he
evidently
preferred
her
company
to
that
of
the
other
members
of
his
family
and
they
often
took
short
largely
silent
walks
usually
down
to
the
salem
marine
railway
where
the
was
undergoing
repairs
his
protracted
silences
were
broken
by
the
sudden
vehement
protests
against
the
generally
muddled
aspect
of
affairs
or
longer
monologues
of
inner
questioning
and
search
he
almost
never
referred
to
her
or
made
her
part
of
a
conversation
she
was
free
to
dwell
on
her
own
emotions
while
he
with
a
corrugated
brow
went
on
in
his
tortuous
and
solitary
course
on
an
afternoon
when
they
had
walked
to
the
foot
of
briggs
street
and
were
gazing
out
over
the
tranquil
water
of
collins
cove
gerrit
ammidon
asked
abruptly
have
you
seen
nettie
vollar
lately
sidsall
was
unable
to
remember
exactly
when
that
had
been
she
rather
thought
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
in
lawrence
place
with
books
under
her
arm
which
she
was
probably
taking
from
the
athenaeum
for
her
grandfather
anyone
she
told
herself
privately
could
see
that
nettie
vollar
would
care
for
books
something
had
occurred
or
threatened
to
occur
between
her
uncle
and
nettie
what
it
was
she
had
never
been
told
but
she
realized
that
only
one
thing
could
really
happen
between
a
man
and
a
girl
they
must
have
been
in
love
in
the
interest
of
this
she
recalled
nettie
appearance
but
was
unable
to
discover
any
marked
attractions
the
elder
had
a
good
figure
rather
full
for
her
age
and
totally
different
from
her
own
square
solidity
her
hair
was
coarse
and
carelessly
arranged
her
clothes
noticeable
for
a
love
of
brightness
rather
than
care
in
the
spending
of
a
small
sum
gerrit
ammidon
had
the
strangest
tastes
he
was
standing
immobile
looking
across
the
cove
as
if
he
were
on
a
searching
for
a
hidden
land
his
legs
were
slightly
spread
firmly
planted
in
a
manner
to
defeat
any
sudden
lurching
she
grew
a
little
impatient
at
him
staring
like
a
block
at
nothing
at
all
she
felt
older
than
he
superior
in
the
knowledge
of
life
he
seemed
hardly
more
than
an
absurd
boy
sidsall
had
a
desire
to
shake
him
he
was
so
so
impracticable
do
you
think
we
better
be
going
she
asked
finally
gerrit
ammidon
turned
and
followed
her
obediently
there
were
lights
in
the
rope
walk
on
briggs
street
through
a
window
she
could
see
a
man
pacing
down
the
long
narrow
interior
laying
a
strand
of
hemp
from
the
burden
on
his
shoulders
it
made
her
shudder
to
think
of
the
monotonous
passage
forward
and
back
an
eternity
of
rope
yet
life
was
something
like
that
she
took
the
happenings
of
each
day
and
wove
them
into
a
strand
dark
and
bright
a
strand
she
realized
that
grew
stronger
as
it
lengthened
that
would
be
true
of
everyone
of
her
companion
and
grandfather
and
hodie
they
reached
the
house
as
the
family
were
gathering
in
the
dining
room
when
sidsall
found
roger
brevard
unexpectedly
staying
for
supper
she
met
his
direct
greeting
and
smile
with
a
warm
stir
of
pleasure
and
sat
in
a
happy
silence
listening
to
the
voices
about
the
table
her
uncle
had
brought
his
wife
down
and
the
candles
glittering
among
the
lusters
on
the
walls
spread
their
light
over
the
manchu
strange
vivid
figure
everything
about
life
was
so
confusing
sidsall
thought
the
night
flowed
in
at
the
open
windows
drenched
with
magic
here
were
candles
but
outside
were
stars
the
port
in
its
engraved
glass
decanter
seemed
to
burn
with
a
ruby
flame
bah
her
grandfather
was
exclaiming
i
put
a
thousand
dollars
on
gerrit
and
the
against
any
clipper
built
but
mind
in
all
weathers
voyage
by
voyage
william
ammidon
insisted
he
would
be
left
in
the
harbor
the
california
gold
deposits
later
a
crowd
slowly
collecting
recalled
the
fact
that
the
salem
band
was
to
play
that
night
in
the
square
oh
mother
look
laurel
cried
they
got
lamps
in
their
hats
small
wavering
flames
were
being
lighted
on
the
musicians
hats
there
were
melancholy
disconnected
hoots
from
bassoons
and
the
silver
clear
scale
of
a
bugle
ca
i
get
nearer
mother
laurel
implored
as
usual
ca
i
go
and
see
the
little
lamps
on
their
heads
sidsall
and
i
will
look
after
her
roger
brevard
put
in
and
almost
immediately
the
three
were
entering
washington
square
the
throng
was
thickest
directly
behind
the
band
radiating
in
thinning
numbers
to
the
wooden
boundary
fence
laurel
led
them
to
an
advantageous
position
where
they
could
watch
the
curious
effects
of
the
ring
of
lights
above
intent
faces
drawn
by
the
vigorous
blowing
of
instruments
the
leader
in
the
center
of
the
flickering
smoky
illumination
now
beat
with
his
arms
in
one
direction
now
in
another
a
second
selection
followed
and
a
third
during
which
in
surprising
pauses
the
band
shouted
a
concerted
hurrah
sidsall
was
infinitely
contented
how
splendidly
erect
and
calm
and
distinguished
roger
brevard
was
she
hated
younger
men
they
were
only
boys
who
kept
up
a
senseless
talk
about
college
humor
he
saw
instantly
that
the
people
were
crushing
her
skirts
and
firmly
conducted
them
out
of
the
crowd
it
was
nicer
here
beyond
the
wavering
dark
mass
a
waltz
flowed
about
her
so
tender
and
gracious
that
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
laurel
had
to
be
taken
home
and
clasping
brevard
hand
the
little
girl
talked
volubly
as
they
moved
away
and
so
she
said
i
told
her
to
keep
her
topsails
full
what
he
demanded
she
was
falling
off
you
know
losing
way
hell
hatches
laurel
sidsall
corrected
her
sharply
no
you
must
laugh
at
her
only
gerrit
ammidon
was
on
the
steps
the
other
men
were
in
the
library
her
mother
had
gone
up
with
janet
laurel
left
them
and
without
speech
they
walked
through
the
house
to
the
lawn
the
stars
had
apparently
retreated
to
new
infinities
of
distance
and
night
there
was
a
throb
of
music
so
faint
that
it
might
be
only
an
echoing
memory
roger
face
was
pale
and
strained
he
asked
have
you
forgotten
that
we
are
friends
no
she
returned
seriously
lifting
her
look
to
his
he
was
very
close
to
her
and
her
heart
beat
unsteadily
she
had
a
choking
premonition
of
what
was
about
to
occur
but
she
stood
without
the
slightest
attempt
to
prevent
his
kiss
it
affected
him
even
more
than
herself
for
he
stepped
back
sharply
with
his
hands
clenched
roger
was
silent
for
so
long
that
she
said
timidly
i
did
mind
so
much
thank
you
he
replied
almost
harshly
there
no
need
for
you
to
regret
it
no
need
no
need
but
if
it
were
only
a
year
more
we
all
grow
older
she
told
him
wisely
so
we
do
sidsall
and
we
change
but
you
should
stay
exactly
as
you
are
now
white
and
young
and
fragrant
never
the
fruit
but
always
the
blossom
and
always
a
night
in
early
summer
the
afterwards
is
an
indifferent
performance
i
do
understand
her
voice
was
shadowed
sidsall
for
a
moment
do
move
opening
petals
shy
pure
heart
loveliness
i
do
understand
she
repeated
but
the
trouble
had
vanished
she
even
smiled
at
him
she
was
filled
with
an
absolute
security
in
her
vision
of

why
she
had
no
need
to
question
it
was
an
instinct
beyond
search
and
above
knowledge
perhaps
she
thought
as
they
turned
toward
the
house
its
name
was
love
vii
the
days
to
nettie
vollar
seemed
to
be
both
unutterably
dull
and
colored
by
a
possibility
of
excitement
like
an
undercurrent
of
hardly
perceptible
fever
her
mother
it
was
true
took
on
herself
most
of
the
duties
of
barzil
dunsack
house
but
there
were
still
a
large
number
of
little
things
that
returned
unvaried
with
every
morning
noon
and
night
for
the
girl
attention
the
cause
of
any
impending
excitement
except
the
mere
presence
of
gerrit
ammidon
in
salem
now
surely
of
no
moment
to
her
she
was
unable
to
place
the
feeling
that
pervaded
her
most
was
the
heavy
conviction
that
her
life
was
a
complete
waste
she
had
the
sensation
of
being
condemned
to
stay
in
surroundings
in
a
service
that
never
for
a
moment
represented
her
desire
or
true
capabilities
her
family
as
she
had
grown
into
maturity
seemed
strange
her
place
there
an
unhappy
accident
at
her
brightest
periods
she
pictured
being
suddenly
arbitrarily
removed
into
happier
appropriate
regions
for
a
time
that
vision
had
assumed
the
tangible
shape
of
gerrit
ammidon
then
this
comfortable
figure
had
abruptly
left
her
to
an
infinitely
more
seldom
return
of
her
faint
indefinite
hope
through
the
inordinate
number
of
hours
when
she
was
potentially
alone
she
had
developed
a
strain
of
almost
painful
thought
out
of
keeping
with
the
whole
of
her
naturally
unreflective
being
in
moments
such
as
the
present
she
was
sitting
in
her
room
overlooking
hardy
street
on
its
landward
reach
she
followed
the
slow
turnings
of
her
mind
in
the
manner
of
a
child
spelling
out
a
sentence
two
things
seemed
to
her
of
the
first
importance
the
existence
into
which
she
had
been
forced
by
the
circumstance
of
her
birth
and
her
unknown
father
himself
unknown
that
is
except
for
vague
promptings
and
desires
which
for
need
of
a
better
reason
she
traced
to
his
personality
that
he
was
superior
in
that
he
had
had
a
distinct
measure
of
gentle
blood
she
was
assured
by
her
mother
on
one
of
the
rare
occasions
when
the
subject
was
touched
between
them
to
that
she
credited
the
greater
part
of
her
obscure
dissatisfaction
with
conditions
which
she
described
as
mean
the
latter
evidently
did
disturb
her
mother
or
grandfather
she
realized
that
the
silent
severity
of
the
old
man
had
crushed
what
spirit
her
mother
may
have
had
it
was
clear
that
the
elder
woman
had
been
very
pretty
with
wide
fluttering
eyes
which
made
you
think
of
gray
moths
and
delicately
colored
cheeks
but
all
that
had
been
crushed
too
she
was
meek
in
a
way
that
filled
her
daughter
with
determined
resentment
and
fear
the
resentment
sprang
from
the
silent
assertion
that
she
would
be
worn
down
like
that
the
fear
followed
the
realization
of
the
rigid
power
of
the
old
man
and
the
weight
of
all
that
held
her
powerless
to
escape
naturally
she
was
rather
cheerful
than
somber
an
involuntary
gayety
rose
from
her
in
the
drabbest
moments
she
even
defied
barzil
dunsack
with
ribbons
and
flowers
on
her
bonnet
the
prospect
from
her
window
offered
no
relief
from
the
interior
it
was
true
that
in
the
other
direction
she
could
catch
glimpses
of
the
harbor
by
leaning
out
she
could
get
the
comparatively
full
sweep
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
but
there
were
usually
things
ugly
and
restraining
between
her
and
the
freedom
of
the
horizon
her
favorite
place
had
been
at
the
edge
of
the
grass
above
the
tide
but
since
his
return
edward
dunsack
had
hit
upon
it
too
and
his
proximity
made
her
increasingly
uneasy
for
one
thing
he
talked
to
himself
out
loud
principally
in
chinese
and
the
sliding
unintelligible
tongue
accompanied
by
the
sight
of
his
gaunt
yellow
face
his
inattentive
fixed
eyes
gave
her
an
icy
shiver
it
was
almost
worse
when
he
conversed
with
her
in
a
palpable
effort
at
an
effect
of
sympathy
she
rose
and
wandered
finally
to
the
embankment
of
the
garden
the
water
shimmered
under
the
full
flood
of
afternoon
she
was
gazing
at
the
distance
in
an
aimless
manner
that
had
lately
fastened
on
her
when
she
heard
a
stirring
of
the
grass
behind
her
and
edward
dunsack
approached
he
was
livid
in
the
pitiless
light
and
seemed
terribly
fragile
a
thing
that
a
mere
clap
of
thunder
might
crumble
to
nothing
she
felt
that
she
could
sweep
him
away
with
a
broom
yet
at
the
same
time
there
were
startling
gleams
of
inner
violence
a
bitter
energy
an
effect
of
deepness
that
appalled
her
if
you
should
ask
me
he
declared
if
my
opinion
is
of
any
value
say
that
ammidon
owed
you
considerable
he
led
you
to
expect
something
better
than
his
running
away
without
a
word
i
have
an
explanation
out
of
him
of
course
if
he
had
come
back
married
this
affair
with
a
chinese
woman
is
that
it
would
be
all
over
but
somehow
with
things
as
they
are
i
ca
believe
that
it
is
do
you
expect
me
to
go
to
their
house
like
you
did
she
replied
resentfully
he
turned
such
a
malicious
face
on
her
that
instinctively
she
moved
back
for
a
moment
he
was
silent
his
meager
leaden
lips
drawn
tight
over
dark
teeth
in
a
dry
grin
his
fingers
like
curved
wires
then
relaxing
he
cursed
the
entire
house
of
ammidon
the
truth
is
he
ended
that
you
were
a
little
fool
you
had
everything
everything
in
your
hand
and
threw
it
away
his
gaze
strayed
from
her
to
the
surface
of
the
water
a
short
distance
from
the
land
threw
it
away
he
repeated
it
ca
be
got
in
this
country
either
he
was
she
thought
crazy
however
all
that
he
said
about
gerrit
lingered
in
her
mind
it
fanned
to
new
life
the
embers
of
her
rebellion
if
a
chance
should
come
she
would
let
gerrit
ammidon
know
something
of
the
wrong
he
had
done
her
as
her
uncle
had
pointed
out
the
chinese
woman
was
different
from
an
american
a
white
woman
their
entire
position
gerrit
and
her
own
was
peculiar
outside
ordinary
judgments
she
saw
him
occasionally
from
a
distance
as
she
must
continue
to
do
while
he
was
in
salem
since
no
opportunity
had
been
made
for
them
to
exchange
words
that
must
come
from
gerrit
her
mother
called
her
and
she
went
in
finding
the
elder
in
the
kitchen
i
ca
get
enough
heat
to
bake
she
worried
you
can
bear
your
hand
right
in
the
oven
your
grandfather
wo
have
his
sponge
biscuit
for
supper
nettie
declared
i
certainly
would
let
it
bother
me
just
tell
him
and
let
him
say
what
he
likes
her
mother
turned
palpably
startled
but
she
began
weakly
i
know
exactly
what
you
going
to
say
nettie
cut
in
he
has
it
every
night
and
he
expect
it
how
much
i
like
to
ask
have
you
been
expecting
all
your
life
and
getting
nothing
and
now
i
am
the
same
i
do
believe
we
as
wicked
as
grandfather
lets
on
and
certain
he
not
so
good
as
he
thinks
i
do
admit
we
are
going
to
hell
either
if
i
did
i
can
tell
you
i
be
different
i
have
a
good
time
like
some
other
girls
i
see
i
guess
it
would
be
good
anyhow
with
silk
flounces
four
yards
around
i
what
i
am
because
i
listen
to
him
i
do
pay
any
attention
to
the
pious
old
women
who
make
long
faces
at
us
you
must
talk
like
that
nettie
her
mother
protested
anxiously
it
has
a
right
hard
sound
your
grandfather
is
a
very
upright
religious
man
it
proper
for
those
who
sin
to
suffer
in
this
world
that
they
may
be
humble
for
the
next
i
do
want
to
be
humble
nettie
told
her
the
ammidons
humble
saltonstone
is
a
pain
deepened
visibly
on
the
pale
countenance
you
must
think
it
does
hurt
me
nettie
to
to
see
you
away
from
all
the
pleasure
it
tears
at
my
heart
dreadful
that
is
part
of
the
punishment
the
girl
made
a
vivid
gesture
but
you
sit
back
and
take
it
she
cried
you
talk
of
it
as
punishment
i
wo
i
wo
i
going
to
do
something
different
what
her
mother
demanded
terrified
i
do
know
nettie
admitted
but
if
i
had
it
to
do
over
i
kiss
gerrit
ammidon
as
soon
as
he
looked
for
it
nettie
do
you
do
you
think
he
wanted
to
marry
you
yes
she
answered
shortly
he
like
that
whatever
you
might
say
against
him
he
honest
her
mother
began
to
cry
large
slow
tears
that
rolled
out
of
her
eyes
without
a
sound
she
sat
with
lax
hopeless
hands
in
her
lap
of
cheap
worn
dress
stuff
nettie
vollar
felt
no
impulse
toward
crying
she
was
bright
with
anger
anger
at
what
barzil
dunsack
had
done
with
her
mother
at
the
harm
he
had
worked
in
her
you
are
a
saint
compared
to
uncle
edward
she
asserted
i
do
know
what
wrong
with
him
but
there
is
something
i
noticed
it
too
times
his
eyes
are
glazed
like
and
then
his
staring
at
you
like
a
cat
it
a
fact
he
does
eat
right
and
he
forgets
what
said
as
soon
as
a
body
speaks
might
he
have
some
chinese
disease
do
you
think
it
not
like
a
real
sickness
the
evening
in
the
dreary
sitting
room
with
only
the
reddish
illumination
of
one
lamp
was
almost
unendurable
her
grandfather
sat
with
broad
wasted
hands
gripping
his
shrunken
knees
his
eyes
gazing
stonily
out
above
a
nose
netted
with
fine
blue
veins
and
harsh
mouth
almost
concealed
by
the
curtain
of
beard
edward
rose
uneasily
and
returned
casting
a
swelling
and
diminishing
shadow
obscurely
unnatural
like
himself
over
the
faded
and
wall
paper
her
mother
was
bowed
speechless
nettie
wanted
to
scream
to
horrify
them
all
with
some
outrageous
remark
she
would
have
liked
to
knock
the
lamp
from
the
table
send
it
crashing
over
the
floor
and
see
the
flames
spread
out
consume
the
house
consume
she
stopped
horrified
at
her
thoughts
she
did
want
things
like
that
in
her
mind
she
continued
but
the
echo
of
dancing
of
music
of
the
salem
band
marching
up
essex
street
with
morse
playing
his
celebrated
silvery
fanfare
on
the
bugle
she
wanted
to
laugh
to
talk
yes
to
love
why
she
was
young
barely
and
here
she
was
in
a
house
like
the
old
cemetery
on
charter
street
before
they
went
to
bed
her
grandfather
would
read
out
from
the
bible
but
always
the
old
testament
finally
he
rose
and
secured
the
volume
bound
in
dusty
calf
its
pages
brown
along
the
edges
his
voice
rang
in
a
slow
emphasized
fervor
thou
not
procured
this
unto
thyself
in
that
thou
hast
forsaken
the
lord
thy
god
when
he
led
thee
by
the
way
now
what
hast
thou
to
do
in
the
way
of
egypt
to
drink
the
waters
of
sihor
or
what
hast
thou
to
do
in
the
way
of
assyria
to
drink
the
waters
of
the
river
own
wickedness
shall
correct
thee
and
thy
backslidings
shall
reprove
thee
know
therefore
and
see
that
it
is
an
evil
thing
and
bitter
that
thou
hast
forsaken
the
lord
thy
god
and
that
my
fear
is
not
in
thee
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
of
old
i
have
broken
thy
yoke
and
burst
thy
bonds
and
thou
saidst
i
will
not
transgress
when
upon
every
high
hill
and
under
every
green
tree
thou
wanderest
playing
the
harlot
i
had
planted
thee
a
noble
vine
wholly
a
right
seed
how
then
art
thou
turned
into
the
degenerate
plant
of
a
strange
vine
unto
me
though
thou
wash
thee
with
nitre
nettie
was
impressed
intimidated
in
spite
of
the
contrary
resolution
in
the
kitchen
the
words
seemed
to
burn
into
her
mother
herself
like
boiling
fat
from
a
pan
and
a
great
relief
flooded
her
when
she
could
escape
again
to
the
temporary
relief
of
her
room
it
was
hot
the
windows
were
up
and
she
made
no
light
that
might
attract
mosquitoes
or
force
her
to
draw
the
close
shades
she
stood
undressed
luxuriating
in
the
sense
of
freedom
of
body
she
was
richly
white
in
the
gloom
her
full
young
beauty
gave
her
a
feeling
of
contentment
and
strength
and
equally
a
great
loneliness
it
was
corrupt
a
degenerate
plant
she
thought
with
a
passionate
conviction
like
a
cry
she
determined
to
say
no
prayer
to
such
a
ruthless
being
yet
soon
after
in
her
coarse
nightgown
she
found
herself
kneeling
by
the
bed
with
hands
it
was
a
prayer
for
which
barzil
dunsack
would
have
had
nothing
but
condemnation
she
implored
the
dark
the
mystery
of
augustness
for
carnal
and
light
things
yes
for
waltzes
and
quadrilles
and
songs
and
pleasure
young
pleasure
all
the
aching
desires
of
her
health
and
spirit
and
nature
and
years
but
most
for
love
she
said
the
last
blindly
in
an
instinct
without
definition
with
the
feeling
that
it
was
the
key
the
door
to
everything
else
and
in
her
mind
rose
the
image
of
gerrit
ammidon
she
saw
his
firm
direct
countenance
the
frosty
blue
eyes
and
human
warmth
he
need
have
come
at
all
she
added
if
it
had
been
only
to
double
the
dreariness
of
her
existence
she
wondered
a
little
her
emotion
subsiding
at
the
interest
her
uncle
showed
in
her
affairs
it
was
like
what
else
she
had
gathered
of
him
and
she
searched
but
without
success
for
any
hidden
reason
he
might
have
he
actively
blackened
the
name
of
ammidon
while
he
was
lost
in
too
great
an
indifference
to
be
moved
by
any
but
extraordinary
pressures
everything
left
his
mind
as
her
mother
had
said
almost
immediately
suddenly
weary
she
gave
up
all
effort
at
understanding
a
wind
moved
in
from
the
sea
fluttering
the
light
curtains
and
brought
her
a
sense
of
coolness
and
release
it
came
from
the
immense
free
sweep
of
ocean
to
which
her
sinking
consciousness
turned
in
peaceful
recognition
and
surrender
altogether
in
the
days
that
followed
she
realized
a
greater
degree
of
mental
freedom
than
before
her
revolt
she
had
removed
herself
it
appeared
a
little
outside
the
family
almost
as
if
she
were
studying
them
calmly
through
a
window
a
large
part
of
the
terror
her
grandfather
had
possessed
for
her
had
disappeared
leaving
for
her
recognition
a
very
old
and
worn
man
she
was
sorry
for
her
mother
with
a
deep
affection
mixed
with
impatience
at
first
she
had
tried
to
put
something
of
her
own
revived
spirit
in
the
older
woman
but
it
was
like
pouring
water
into
a
cracked
glass
her
mother
was
too
utterly
broken
to
hold
any
resolution
whatever
nettie
feeling
for
edward
dunsack
became
an
instinctive
deep
distrust
it
was
almost
impossible
for
her
to
remain
when
as
he
so
often
did
now
he
approached
her
to
talk
about
the
injustice
of
her
mode
of
life
and
the
debt
gerrit
ammidon
owed
her
he
would
stand
with
his
fingers
twitching
talking
in
a
rapid
sharp
voice
blinking
continuously
against
any
light
brighter
than
that
of
a
shaded
room
or
dusk
he
seldom
left
the
office
or
went
out
through
the
day
his
place
at
the
dinner
table
was
far
more
often
empty
than
not
but
after
their
early
supper
in
the
long
late
june
twilights
he
had
an
inexhaustible
desire
for
her
to
stroll
with
him
she
occasionally
agreed
for
the
reason
that
they
invariably
passed
in
the
vicinity
of
washington
square
and
pleasant
street
and
saw
the
impressive
block
of
the
ammidon
mansion
however
they
never
met
any
of
its
inmates
once
they
had
walked
directly
by
the
entrance
some
girls
perhaps
a
woman
certainly
two
men
were
grouped
in
the
doorway
it
was
growing
dark
and
nettie
could
be
certain

dunsack
clearly
hesitated
before
the
bricks
leading
in
between
the
high
white
fence
posts
topped
with
carved
twisting
flames
and
in
a
sudden
agony
at
the
possibility
of
his
stopping
nettie
hurried
on
her
cheeks
flaming
and
her
heart
she
thought
thumping
in
her
throat
her
uncle
followed
her
there
was
a
trail
of
intimate
merriment
from
the
portico
a
man
voice
mingling
gayly
with
those
of
the
girls
that
was
the
brevard
who
in
the
mongolian
marine
insurance
company
edward
dunsack
informed
her
i
hear
he
a
great
hand
for
leading
cotillions
and
balls
the
balls
you
ought
to
take
part
in
on
and
on
he
went
with
the
familiar
recital
of
her
wrongs
it
carried
them
all
the
way
over
pleasant
and
essex
and
derby
streets
home
the
next
day
however
he
was
forced
to
go
about
the
town
and
returned
for
dinner
in
a
state
of
excitement
evident
to
anyone
he
ate
without
attention
whatever
was
before
him
and
extravagantly
pleasant
related
how
he
had
conversed
with
gerrit
ammidon
in
the
family
carriage
in
front
of
the
countinghouse
of
ammidon
ammidon
and
saltonstone
on
liberty
street
nettie
was
surprised
that
his
concern
was
caused
by
such
a
commonplace
event
the
women
of
china
words
failing
him
he
waved
a
thin
dry
hand
his
father
frowned
heavily
then
abruptly
as
if
he
had
been
snatched
out
of
his
chair
by
an
invisible
powerful
clutch
he
started
up
and
disappeared
the
afternoon
passed
the
full
and
nettie
bound
in
preparation
for
supper
for
redmond
the
virginia
oysterman
at
derby
wharf
stood
waiting
for
some
money
i
ca
think
where
i
left
my
reticule
her
mother
called
unless
it
in
edward
room
where
i
cleaned
this
morning
just
run
up
and
see
he
be
at
the
office
above
nettie
found
the
door
closed
but
it
opened
readily
as
she
turned
the
knob
she
went
in
without
hesitation
the
interior
she
naturally
thought
was
empty
and
then
with
an
unreasoning
cold
fear
she
saw
that
edward
dunsack
was
lying
on
the
bed
some
of
his
clothes
were
tumbled
on
the
floor
and
he
wore
his
black
chinese
gown
the
room
was
permeated
with
a
heavy
smooth
odor
on
a
stand
at
her
uncle
hand
was
a
curious
collection
of
strange
objects
a
little
brass
lamp
with
a
flickering
bluish
flame
a
black
and
silver
object
like
a
swollen
unnatural
pipe
stained
bodkins
a
lump
of
what
she
took
to
be
tar
her
attention
was
caught
by
edward
dunsack
face
it
had
fallen
back
with
his
pinched
chin
pointing
toward
the
ceiling
it
was
the
color
of
yellow
clay
and
through
his
eyelids
was
an
empty
glimmer
of
she
shrank
away
involuntarily
and
the
word
dead
formed
just
audibly
on
her
trembling
lips
in
an
instant
she
was
in
the
hall
calling
in
a
voice
her
icy
hands
at
her
throat
and
her
grandfather
mounted
the
stair
with
surprising
agility
followed
by
his
daughter
kate
uncle
edward
nettie
articulated
waving
toward
the
room
from
which
she
had
fled
the
two
women
followed
the
rigid
advance
of
barzil
dunsack
as
he
saw
the
figure
of
his
son
there
was
a
stabbing
gasp
of
his
breath
he
halted
for
a
moment
and
it
seemed
to
nettie
vollar
that
suddenly
his
determined
carriage
crumbled
his
shoulders
sagged
then
he
went
forward
the
bed
had
high
slender
posts
that
at
one
time
supported
a
canopy
but
now
they
were
bare
and
an
old
hand
held
to
one
as
he
bent
over
is
he
dead
the
older
woman
asked
barzil
dunsack
made
no
immediate
reply
his
gaze
turned
from
his
son
to
the
stand
the
fluttering
lamp
and
its
accessories
his
head
moved
slowly
in
the
act
of
sniffing
the
pungent
haze
swimming
in
the
interior
nettie
could
see
his
face
and
she
was
appalled
by
an
expression
grimmer
than
any
she
remembered
it
was
both
harsh
implacable
and
stricken
as
empty
of
blood
as
the
countenance
on
the
bed
the
hand
on
the
post
tightened
until
it
too
was
linen
white
she
drew
close
to
her
mother
side
putting
a
supporting
arm
about
the
soft
shaking
shoulders
no
said
barzil
dunsack
in
a
booming
voice
not
dead
and
yet
dead
forever
go
downstairs
he
commanded
they
backed
confused
to
the
door
if
edward
is
sick
kate
vollar
began
the
old
man
face
blazed
with
intolerable
pain
and
anger
woman
he
demanded
can
you
cure
what
god
has
smitten
his
eyes
alone
hard
and
bright
in
the
seamed
and
hairy
face
drove
them
out
into
the
hall
below
in
the
sitting
room
nettie
exclaimed
he
might
have
told
us
something
whatever
it
is
her
mother
returned
it
dreadful
bad
i
felt
that
all
along
about
edward
he
never
been
himself
this
last
time
mechanically
she
found
her
reticule
beside
the
painted
ostrich
egg
from
africa
you
have
to
get
the
oysters
anyhow
she
told
her
daughter
maintaining
the
inevitable
pressure
of
small
necessities
that
defied
all
tragedy
and
death
nettie
escaped
with
an
enormous
relief
into
the
sunny
normal
tranquility
of
the
afternoon
the
house
had
become
too
horrible
to
bear
and
even
on
the
thronged
length
of
derby
wharf
like
a
street
robbed
of
its
supports
and
thrust
out
into
the
harbor
she
was
followed
by
the
vision
of
edward
dunsack
peaked
clayey
face
she
got
the
oysters
and
in
an
overwhelming
reluctance
to
return
walked
out
to
the
end
of
the
wharf
where
a
ship
was
discharging
her
cargo
heavy
plaited
mats
of
cassia
with
a
delicate
scent
red
and
blue
slabs
of
marble
baskets
of
granular
cakes
of
gray
camphor
rough
brown
logs
of
teak
smooth
dull
yellow
rolls
of
gamboge
bags
with
sharp
conflicting
odors
baled
silks
and
half
chests
of
tea
wrapped
in
bamboos
and
matting
painted
with
the
ship
name
and
there
nettie
found
herself
beside
a
little
girl
clasping
the
hand
of
a
bulky
old
gentleman
in
pongee
and
a
palm
leaf
hat
and
following
every
operation
with
a
grave
critical
regard
i
guess
she
said
to
her
companion
it
only
the
cheap
sort
of
tea
a
late
picking
or
it
would
be
in
canisters
she
was
nettie
realized
the
youngest
ammidon
child
with
her
the
latter
looked
round
and
recognized
nettie
vollar
how
barzil
dunsack
he
asked
immediately
she
was
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
since
she
could
not
describe
the
subject
of
the
inquiry
as
all
right
nor
explain
their
unhappy
condition
intend
to
stop
in
jeremy
ammidon
continued
last
time
i
was
there
i
went
up
like
a
rocket
laurel
that
was
the
child
name
she
remembered
gazed
at
her
intently
i
was
saying
to
grandfather
she
repeated
precisely
that
this
was
really
much
of
a
cargo
nothing
like
the
one
uncle
gerrit
brought
back
in
the
nautilus
we
were
having
an
argument
about
salem
too
but
of
course
all
the
big
cargoes
are
going
into
boston
she
sturdily
confronted
the
flushed
old
man
you
william
all
over
again
he
asserted
almost
annoyed
both
their
expressions
grew
stubborn
in
a
manner
that
in
view
of
their
great
difference
in
age
and
experience
nettie
thought
quite
absurd
what
a
beautiful
dress
the
child
had
on
porto
rico
drawn
work
with
pale
yellow
ribbons
to
her
bonnet
i
wish
you
stay
here
a
minute
with
nettie
vollar
jeremy
told
her
while
i
see
the
wharfinger
he
went
unhurried
along
the
wharf
and
laurel
ammidon
drew
closer
to
her
she
not
much
of
a
ship
either
laurel
said
indicating
the
and
she
built
like
like
grandfather
they
different
now
i
went
to
new
york
to
see
the
launched
and
she
the
tallest
vessel
afloat
with
three
standing
skysail
yards
and
ringtail
and
water
sails
she
black
and
has
a
gilded
dragon
for
a
figurehead
and
although
she
went
out
in
a
gale
got
to
rio
in
days
i
talked
to
captain
waterman
too
he
commanded
the
you
know
how
the
child
ran
on
you
studied
a
lot
on
ships
nettie
commented
i
know
the
main
truck
from
a
jewel
block
laurel
replied
complacently
but
camilla
a
frightful
lubber
i
should
think
she
make
uncle
gerrit
sick
she
does
me
nettie
vollar
was
seized
by
the
temptation
to
question
laurel
about
gerrit
ammidon
about
his
wife
anything
that
touched
or
concerned
him
a
wave
of
emotion
swept
over
her
a
loneliness
and
a
desire
the
cause
of
which
she
would
not
face
she
wanted
to
take
laurel
hand
in
hers
and
with
the
old
ponderous
comfortable
gentleman
go
up
to
the
serenity
of
their
gardens
and
wide
happy
house
she
wanted
gerrit
ammidon
to
smile
at
her
with
his
eyes
blue
like
a
fair
sea
his
father
was
returning
laurel
again
grasped
the
large
hand
and
they
turned
to
leave
jeremy
ammidon
nodded
to
nettie
nothing
remained
for
her
but
the
place
on
hardy
street
then
she
saw
that
the
others
had
stopped
and
were
signaling
for
her
captain
dunsack
old
friend
the
elder
said
abruptly
stubborn
as
the
devil
no
worse
than
me
though
no
worse
than
me
confounded
proud
too
you
let
me
know
if
there
is
anything
that
is
if
you
need
he
paused
breathing
stormily
glaring
at
her
in
an
assumed
angry
impatience
thank
you
she
answered
but
there
nothing
what
most
shocked
her
on
the
return
home
was
the
manner
in
which
their
life
callously
continued
when
she
felt
it
should
have
been
shattered
by
their
suffering
in
edward
dunsack
room
yet
not
so
much
theirs
as
her
grandfather
he
took
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
the
grace
went
up
as
loudly
as
ever
above
their
heads
but
in
spite
of
that
she
saw
that
the
old
man
suddenly
looked
infinitely
spent
his
knife
slipped
insecurely
and
scraped
against
the
plate
in
fumbling
and
palsied
hands
all
at
once
she
had
a
feeling
of
gazing
straight
into
his
heart
and
finding
like
a
burning
ruby
hidden
in
earth
such
an
agony
beneath
his
schooled
exterior
that
she
choked
thinking
about
it
nettie
wondered
what
he
would
do
if
she
put
an
affectionate
arm
about
his
neck
and
told
him
of
their
sympathy
she
knew
now
that
her
uncle
edward
had
been
smoking
opium
and
that
it
was
a
worse
vice
more
hopeless
and
destructive
than
drink
but
she
was
certain
that
he
repel
her
he
looked
on
them
all
edward
dunsack
her
mother
and
herself
as
sinful
degenerate
plants
even
now
she
realized
there
was
no
weakening
of
his
spiritual
fibers
such
as
had
plainly
overtaken
his
physical
being
he
had
a
blasting
contempt
for
the
unrighteous
flesh
when
they
had
risen
from
the
table
edward
dunsack
appeared
and
sinking
weakly
into
a
chair
demanded
a
cup
of
tea
he
knew
nothing
of
their
discovery
of
the
fact
that
they
had
stood
above
his
revolting
insensibility
after
the
tea
he
seemed
to
revive
he
lighted
a
cheroot
and
said
something
about
going
out
it
was
possible
however
his
knees
sagged
walking
the
length
of
the
floor
in
the
sitting
room
he
fell
into
a
leaden
apathy
nettie
vollar
gaze
rested
on
the
volume
of
the
life
of
the
missionary
who
had
died
at
such
an
early
age
on
the
île
de
france
the
lamplight
spread
over
the
depressing
mustard
yellow
paint
of
the
woodwork
with
its
obviously
false
graining
and
deepened
the
blackness
of
the
fireplace
throughout
the
reading
of
the
scripture
edward
dunsack
never
shifted
his
slumped
position
his
face
with
smudged
closed
eyes
seemed
fixed
in
a
skeptical
smile
the
hollows
of
his
temples
were
green
the
reading
finished
old
barzil
said
i
wish
to
speak
to
edward
alone
the
latter
straightened
up
eh
he
exclaimed
what
he
resettled
his
stock
and
crossed
a
knee
with
a
show
of
ease
nettie
followed
her
mother
from
the
room
her
last
impression
was
that
of
a
startling
resemblance
between
the
young
man
and
old
her
uncle
face
was
as
ruined
as
the
other
between
father
and
son
i
wish
he
go
away
her
mother
surprisingly
asserted
i
wo
sleep
for
thinking
of
him
lying
there
like
a
corpse
he
not
nettie
replied
musing
something
is
holding
him
we
still
do
know
of
she
had
lately
begun
to
realize
a
great
many
things
of
which
only
a
month
before
she
had
not
been
aware
that
sudden
illuminating
grasp
of
old
barzil
inner
pain
of
her
mother
wasted
spirit
and
the
sense
that
some
unguessed
potent
motive
was
at
the
back
of
her
uncle
apparently
erratic
strolling
and
reiterations
nettie
stopped
to
wonder
a
little
at
the
change
in
herself
she
was
more
alive
more
included
there
were
no
reasons
that
she
could
see
why
this
should
be
so
never
had
the
present
the
entire
future
been
darker
with
her
deeper
consciousness
too
came
an
increased
shrinking
from
life
a
greater
capacity
for
injury
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
an
older
nettie
vollar
who
in
her
mirror
returned
the
questioning
in
the
resentful
black
eyes
no
further
mention
was
made
of
the
opium
no
hint
escaped
from
the
two
men
of
what
barzil
dunsack
had
said
to
his
son
after
the
evening
reading
of
the
bible
an
evidence
of
the
miserable
episode
was
visible
for
a
while
in
the
difficulty
of
any
attempted
general
conversation
then
that
died
away
and
everything
was
seemingly
as
it
had
been
before
but
the
rising
gayety
and
widespread
public
preparations
at
the
approach
of
the
fourth
of
july
made
her
existence
drabber
than
ever
there
was
too
unusual
planning
for
later
in
the
month
president
polk
was
to
be
in
salem
the
various
military
organizations
drilled
incessantly
the
salem
light
infantry
the
mechanic
light
infantry
the
salem
cadets
and
independents
and
a
squad
of
the
salem
artillery
might
be
seen
at
any
hour
of
the
morning
or
early
evening
smartly
marching
and
countermarching
led
by
flag
or
the
salem
band
strange
constructions
of
light
wood
climbed
in
washington
square
the
set
pieces
of
the
celebrated
pyrotechnist
secured
at
a
staggering
expense
preliminary
strings
of
firecrackers
were
exploded
by
impatient
boys
and
the
dawn
of
the
holiday
was
greeted
with
a
sustained
uproar
of
powder
all
this
was
communicated
to
nettie
in
the
form
of
a
determination
to
forget
the
dreariness
of
home
and
for
once
anyhow
be
a
part
of
the
careless
holiday
town
edward
dunsack
opened
the
day
by
deprecating
what
fireworks
salem
could
show
and
recalling
the
extravagant
art
of
china
in
that
particular
no
one
he
said
of
the
least
moment
would
be
abroad
in
the
rabble
and
he
intended
to
spend
the
day
over
the
invoice
of
a
schooner
returned
from
curaçao
she
was
glad
of
this
for
it
left
her
free
to
get
an
uninterrupted
pleasure
from
the
morning
parade
the
floats
and
fantasies
the
afternoon
drilling
in
washington
square
and
see
the
last
colored
disk
of
the
fireworks
maybe
she
told
herself
tying
the
becoming
ribbon
of
her
bonnet
beneath
a
round
chin
with
a
lurking
dimple
maybe
she
would
come
back
home
once
during
the
entire
day
she
ignored
in
the
rush
of
her
spirits
even
her
mother
lonely
labors
for
once
they
have
to
do
without
her
nettie
took
a
scarlet
merino
shawl
for
the
cooler
evening
shook
forward
the
little
black
curls
about
her
face
and
hurried
away
from
hardy
street
she
was
swept
along
in
the
crowd
on
essex
street
until
before
the
office
of
the
salem
she
found
a
place
that
commanded
the
parade
there
nettie
lost
all
memory
of
the
dreariness
that
pressed
upon
her
she
became
one
of
the
throng
applauding
the
members
of
the
east
india
marine
society
carrying
the
palanquin
from
the
museum
in
native
dress
or
stood
with
sentimental
tears
blurring
her
vision
the
parade
ended
and
currents
of
people
swept
toward
dinner
but
she
stopped
at
a
baker
and
got
a
paper
of
seed
cakes
made
in
the
shape
of
oak
leaves
and
sat
contentedly
eating
them
in
the
common
the
thought
of
gerritt
ammidon
with
all
the
other
deeper
aspects
of
her
life
was
thrust
into
the
back
of
her
consciousness
she
was
existing
as
she
breathed
without
will
the
instinctive
lighter
qualities
had
her
in
full
possession
she
felt
that
her
cheeks
were
glowing
and
hummed
the
refrains
of
the
music
she
had
heard
one
by
one
the
military
companies
marched
into
the
square
she
was
fascinated
by
the
tall
leather
helmets
and
silver
straps
under
severe
young
lips
the
newburyport
men
were
in
a
new
scarlet
uniform
that
was
the
boston
brass
band
it
was
painted
on
the
bass
drum
with
the
independents
there
were
the
beverly
taylor
guards
the
massed
onlookers
filled
the
broad
plain
the
drilling
and
countermarching
proceeded
and
the
afternoon
waned
at
the
disposal
of
the
spectacle
when
for
an
hour
or
two
washington
square
was
comparatively
deserted
when
the
sun
sank
lower
and
lower
over
the
roofs
of
brown
street
and
the
gold
haze
thickened
turning
to
blue
nettie
became
quieter
but
no
less
happy
the
time
sped
never
was
she
conscious
of
being
lonely
by
herself
in
a
multitude
composed
of
grouped
families
and
friends
it
was
all
such
a
beautiful
relief
to
the
other
constant
dwelling
on
somber
and
hopeless
facts
already
people
were
streaming
in
under
the
wooden
arched
gates
for
the
evening
display
already
she
could
see
a
star
in
the
green
east
the
fireworks
the
papers
said
were
to
be
in
two
parts
ending
with
a
bombardment
of
vera
cruz
five
hundred
feet
long
and
a
series
of
triumphant
arches
with
portraits
in
colored
lights
of
celebrated
americans
there
was
a
sudden
salute
of
artillery
and
a
flight
of
rockets
soared
upward
in
long
flaming
curves
dissolving
in
showers
of
liquid
emerald
and
ruby
and
silver
against
the
night
bengola
lights
casting
a
blue
glare
over
the
standing
mob
and
farther
house
fronts
were
followed
by
a
great
peruvian
cross
a
silvery
fountain
of
water
and
grand
representation
of
bunker
hill
monument
with
this
the
first
came
all
too
soon
to
an
end
and
nettie
was
folding
the
shawl
about
her
shoulders
when
almost
the
entire
ammidon
family
were
upon
her
in
an
instinctive
confusion
she
saw
william
ammidon
and
his
wife
with
their
daughters
the
old
man
jeremy
and
gerrit
they
stopped
before
her
in
an
assured
not
unkindly
inquisitiveness
the
girls
fresh
and
with
crisp
lovely
clothes
their
mother
in
a
smart
mantle
and
little
bonnet
with
knots
of
french
flowers
greeted
her
with
a
direct
question
tempered
by
a
smile
william
ammidon
smoking
was
unconcerned
while
gerrit
stayed
obscured
outside
the
group
whom
are
you
with
nettie
rhoda
ammidon
asked
and
when
she
admitted
that
she
was
alone
the
elder
with
visible
disapproval
asserted
that
wo
do
at
all
in
this
rough
assembly
i
must
see
that
you
are
taken
care
of
she
hesitated
with
a
slight
frown
on
her
handsome
brow
but
you
will
want
to
see
the
rest
of
the
fireworks
yes
what
you
must
do
is
to
come
over
to
our
steps
the
view
from
there
is
fairly
good
and
then
some
one
can
walk
home
with
you
they
moved
resolutely
forward
giving
nettie
vollar
no
opportunity
for
protest
the
expression
of
what
she
might
prefer
and
with
so
many
determined
minds
she
dropped
silently
into
their
progress
she
was
beside
rhoda
ammidon
the
girls
trooped
on
before
and
the
men
gerrit
ammidon
followed
her
peace
of
mind
had
been
broken
into
a
hundred
doubts
and
acute
questions
she
wished
that
she
had
declined
to
go
with
them
the
invitation
no
command
had
been
a
criticism
really
now
after
so
long
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
become
suddenly
responsible
for
her
the
happiness
of
the
day
sank
a
little
thoughts
of
her
mother
and
grandfather
and
uncle
edward
returned
but
at
the
same
time
she
realized
that
she
was
near
gerrit
once
more
this
made
a
confusion
of
her
emotions
that
hid
what
she
most
felt
about
him
it
was
a
proximity
that
meant
anything
however
it
had
been
utterly
different
when
he
came
to
see
her
before
his
marriage
yet
just
the
fact
of
his
being
close
behind
her
and
that
she
would
be
on
the
steps
at
the
ammidons
with
him
undoubtedly
had
a
power
to
stir
her
heart
it
brought
like
her
carefree
excursion
a
certain
momentary
glow
a
warmth
without
relation
to
what
had
gone
before
or
might
follow
there
was
the
same
quality
of
momentary
rest
refreshment
complete
and
isolated
as
a
jewel
in
a
ring
she
did
analyze
it
further
but
drifted
with
the
vigorous
chattering
tide
of
the
ammidons
they
arrived
at
the
impressive
entrance
open
on
a
high
dim
interior
jeremy
and
william
ammidon
went
in
rhoda
lingered
while
a
chair
was
brought
for
her
and
sidsall
and
camilla
laurel
and
janet
ranged
themselves
facing
the
square
gerrit
hung
silent
in
the
doorway
perhaps
taou
yuen
will
come
down
rhoda
ammidon
suggested
and
throat
was
pinched
at
the
possibility
of
seeing
gerrit
chinese
wife
but
he
answered
shortly
in
the
negative
taou
yuen
preferred
to
stay
in
her
room
the
view
from
her
window
was
better
than
this
the
latter
was
easily
possible
for
here
the
set
pieces
were
almost
unintelligible
an
impressive
beehive
could
be
seen
surrounded
by
swarming
golden
bees
a
pyramid
of
roman
candles
discharged
their
rushes
of
colored
balls
and
streamers
but
the
bombardment
of
vera
cruz
was
a
cause
of
bitter
complaint
to
the
children
the
fireworks
had
ceased
to
have
the
slightest
significance
for
nettie
she
was
luxuriating
in
the
suavity
of
the
ammidon
steps
and
company
it
seemed
to
her
that
an
actual
air
of
ease
rolled
out
over
her
from
within
seen
from
her
place
of
vantage
the
great
throng
in
the
square
was
without
feature
the
passersby
on
pleasant
street
as
edward
dunsack
and
herself
had
been
were
unimportant
the
massive
portico
and
dignified
fence
the
sense
of
spaciousness
and
gardens
and
lofty
formal
ceilings
the
feeling
of
fine
silks
and
round
clear
direct
voices
of
servants
for
everything
everyone
transcended
in
force
all
her
speculations
she
was
familiar
who
was
in
salem
with
the
meaning
of
the
house
name
java
head
it
was
more
quite
heaven
thoughts
of
gerrit
winged
in
and
out
of
her
mind
like
wayward
birds
she
turned
with
studied
caution
and
glanced
swiftly
but
intently
at
as
much
of
his
countenance
as
she
could
see
her
memory
vividly
supplied
the
rest
there
was
another
like
it
one
so
clear
and
compelling
to
read
in
the
world
the
past
in
which
he
had
had
a
part
seemed
like
an
impossibly
happy
dream
she
was
hardly
able
to
believe
that
he
had
been
in
their
sitting
room
walked
with
her
in
the
evening
to
the
grassy
edge
of
the
harbor
or
held
her
fingers
in
his
hard
cool
grasp
now
she
wondered
if
he
were
contented
she
could
quite
decide
from
glimpses
of
his
face
but
something
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
vision
disturbed
her
with
the
certainty
that
he
was
troubled
it
might
mean
unhappiness
but
she
was
sure
now
there
go
the
arches
a
young
voice
exclaimed
and
i
just
ca
see
anything
you
never
know
at
all
it
was
a
temple
of
eight
columns
oh
look
there
a
number
coming
out
fourth
seventeen
a
tide
of
hand
clapping
swept
over
the
dark
masses
no
laurel
continued
that
salem
it
washington
no
general
taylor
the
amazing
day
nettie
realized
was
over
the
people
flowed
back
through
the
gates
like
a
lake
breaking
in
streams
from
its
bank
there
was
a
stir
on
the
steps
looking
up
she
saw
that
the
stars
were
obscured
and
a
low
rumble
of
thunder
sounded
from
a
distance
a
flash
lit
the
horizon
now
she
must
go
back
return
to
hardy
street
to
her
bitter
grandfather
like
an
iron
statue
eaten
by
rust
and
storms
to
edward
dunsack
following
her
with
his
dragging
feet
and
thin
insinuating
voice
to
her
hopeless
mother
it
the
powder
she
heard
about
what
she
had
no
conception
rhoda
ammidon
turned
decidedly
to
her
it
was
nice
to
have
you
nettie
she
declared
but
we
must
see
about
getting
you
safely
home
the
carriage
would
be
best
since
it
threatening
rain
she
did
she
replied
want
to
give
them
so
much
bother
she
often
went
on
errands
after
supper
she
be
all
right
nonsense
ammidon
interrupted
impatiently
then
gerrit
advanced
from
the
doorway
i
walk
down
with
her
he
said
almost
roughly
no
need
to
take
the
horses
out
so
late
nettie
vollar
thought
that
his
mouth
tightened
in
protest
but
he
gave
them
no
chance
for
further
argument
he
descended
the
steps
with
a
quick
grinding
tread
and
she
was
forced
to
hurry
through
her
acknowledgments
in
order
to
overtake
him
the
night
at
once
absorbed
them
the
air
charged
with
the
fumes
of
gunpowder
and
rumbling
with
low
intermittent
thunder
was
oppressive
and
disturbing
gerrit
head
was
exactly
opposite
her
own
and
she
could
see
his
profile
pale
and
still
moving
on
a
changing
dark
background
he
walked
with
the
short
firm
stride
men
acquire
on
the
unsteady
decks
of
vessels
swinging
his
arms
but
slightly
neither
spoke
the
rain
nettie
saw
was
hanging
off
probably
it
would
not
reach
salem
washington
square
was
already
empty
except
for
a
small
obscure
stir
by
the
scaffolding
for
the
fireworks
a
murmur
of
young
voices
came
from
a
door
on
bath
street
such
minute
observations
filled
her
mind
beneath
their
surface
she
was
conscious
of
a
deep
a
fathomless
turmoil
it
was
a
curious
sensation
curious
because
she
could
tell
whether
it
was
happiness
or
misery
one
now
exactly
resembled
the
other
to
nettie
vollar
she
grasped
however
one
difference
it
was
happiness
now
the
misery
belonged
to
tomorrow
but
suddenly
that
last
unrealized
fact
at
once
immaterial
and
the
most
leaden
reality
of
all
lost
its
weight
the
greater
freedom
she
had
lately
grown
into
became
an
absolute
indifference
a
half
willful
and
half
automatic
shutting
of
her
eyes
to
everything
but
the
present
the
actuality
of
gerrit
ammidon
walking
by
her
side
she
wanted
him
to
speak
so
that
she
could
discover
his
thoughts
feelings
yet
she
was
reluctant
to
have
their
companionship
of
silence
broken
words
almost
all
the
possible
terms
she
could
imagine
would
only
emphasize
the
distance
between
them
she
was
thinking
of
one
now
a
word
he
had
never
pronounced
but
which
she
felt
had
been
however
obscurely
at
the
back
of
the
attention
he
had
paid
her
love
it
was
a
queer
thing
it
seemed
to
be
everyone
agreed
that
it
was
of
the
greatest
perhaps
the
first
importance
and
yet
all
sorts
of
other
considerations
some
insignificant
and
others
mean
and
more
yes
cowardly
held
it
in
check
drove
it
back
out
of
sight
as
you
might
hurriedly
shut
some
shabby
object
into
a
closet
at
the
arrival
of
visitors
how
have
you
been
he
demanded
in
the
abrupt
voice
of
the
expression
of
his
determination
to
see
her
home
well
enough
she
assured
him
if
he
meant
her
health
he
glanced
at
her
with
somber
eyes
not
altogether
he
admitted
it
included
your
family
things
generally
they
are
as
bad
as
possible
she
told
him
she
admitted
this
frankly
a
part
of
her
entire
surrender
to
the
moment
careless
of
how
it
might
affect
him
they
would
be
he
muttered
savagely
it
a
habit
here
the
here
she
knew
referred
to
life
on
shore
his
gloomy
attitude
toward
the
management
and
affairs
of
the
land
had
caused
her
a
great
deal
of
precious
laughter
he
had
revealed
a
most
astonishing
ignorance
of
necessities
that
she
had
understood
instinctively
when
hardly
more
than
a
child
and
this
simplicity
had
as
much
as
anything
brought
her
affection
for
him
to
life
at
the
same
time
she
in
particular
had
felt
the
justice
of
a
great
many
of
his
charges
but
no
one
could
reasonably
hope
for
the
sort
of
world
a
world
as
orderly
and
trim
as
that
of
a
narrow
ship
he
thought
should
be
brought
about
by
a
mere
command
nettie
wished
that
it
could
she
sighed
gazing
at
him
then
it
no
better
than
before
he
asked
adding
with
a
descriptive
gesture
the
town
and
people
i
hardly
speak
to
ten
in
a
year
outside
the
stores
and
like
that
of
course
they
nod
going
into
church
or
a
lady
i
mean
really
your
will
say
something
nice
even
do
what
you
saw
though
it
the
first
time
anything
like
that
has
happened
she
caught
a
repressed
bitter
oath
i
suppose
i
get
used
to
it
she
continued
no
i
wo
she
added
differently
never
never
never
if
you
were
a
man
now
he
said
with
an
incredible
stupidity
she
wondered
angrily
if
he
rather
have
her
a
man
there
had
been
a
time
nettie
reflected
when
such
a
possibility
would
have
stirred
him
to
violent
protest
and
this
brought
out
the
reflection
that
while
at
one
time
he
might
have
cared
for
her
now
perhaps
he
was
merely
sorry
for
her
unhappiness
yes
this
must
be
it
she
had
a
momentary
fatal
impulse
to
throw
back
at
him
scornfully
any
such
small
kindness
she
did
she
told
herself
want
condescending
sympathy
what
silenced
her
was
the
sudden
knowledge
that
she
did
she
wanted
anything
whatsoever
from
gerrit
ammidon
the
fact
that
he
had
a
chinese
wife
was
powerless
to
alter
her
feeling
in
the
smallest
degree
on
the
contrary
she
was
shocked
to
find
that
it
had
increased
immensely
it
was
growing
with
every
minute
she
wondered
drearily
if
her
stubborn
love
the
term
took
its
place
without
remark
in
the
procession
of
her
thoughts
for
gerrit
did
in
spite
of
her
protest
to
the
contrary
stamp
her
as
quite
bad
perhaps
her
grandfather
was
right
about
them
all
her
mother
and
uncle
edward
and
herself
and
they
were
wicked
lost
the
energy
with
which
she
had
combated
this
charge
now
faced
by
the
circumstance
of
her
realized
affection
for
a
man
married
to
some
one
else
even
chinese
wavered
all
the
cheerful
influences
of
the
day
rising
to
the
supreme
tranquil
hour
on
the
ammidon
porch
sank
to
dejection
it
was
like
the
flight
of
the
rockets
she
walked
listlessly
her
brain
was
numb
she
was
terribly
tired
gerrit
ammidon
head
was
bent
and
she
was
unable
to
see
his
expression
he
might
even
have
forgotten
by
the
token
of
his
progress
that
she
was
at
his
side
there
going
to
be
a
stir
in
ammidon
ammidon
and
saltonstone
he
said
presently
when
my
father
hears
of
the
new
program
everything
is
turning
to
the
fastest
california
runs
possible
william
and
james
saltonstone
want
me
to
take
command
of
a
clipper
but
i
find
i
like
my
father
nettie
all
my
experience
has
been
in
the
east
and
the
china
service
i
used
to
it
i
never
get
on
navigating
a
passenger
boat
a
packet
ship
from
boston
to
san
francisco
and
san
francisco
to
boston
the
other
in
my
blood
too
running
the
northeast
trades
to
brazil
and
coming
up
into
the
southwest
passage
winds
for
the
cape
of
good
hope
a
long
reach
nearly
to
australia
and
then
north
again
to
the
indian
ocean
and
southeast
trades
i
fit
for
that
for
long
voyages
a
sailor
and
all
it
means
but
battering
back
and
forward
round
the
horn
with
my
deck
cluttered
up
by
prospectors
and
shore
crews
the
mates
would
have
to
slam
into
the
rigging
his
exclamation
refused
every
face
of
such
a
possibility
she
understood
his
necessity
completely
and
the
brief
account
of
such
far
happy
journeys
safe
from
everything
that
salem
had
come
to
mean
for
her
filled
her
with
longing
i
beginning
to
see
he
took
up
again
the
that
i
am
to
blame
for
a
good
deal
that
i
found
fault
with
in
others
i
mean
that
i
a
different
variety
of
animal
and
naturally
no
judge
of
the
kinds
of
holes
they
live
in
or
the
way
their
affairs
are
managed
you
are
worlds
better
she
cried
he
turned
to
her
obviously
startled
and
she
held
for
a
long
breath
his
unguarded
intense
gaze
not
very
useful
i
am
afraid
he
replied
at
last
not
today
anyhow
i
belong
to
a
life
that
is
dying
nettie
mark
my
words
dying
if
not
already
dead
and
i
newfangled
to
my
father
it
goes
as
quickly
as
that
this
was
a
fresh
mood
to
all
her
knowledge
of
his
impatient
arrogance
and
one
that
sent
her
to
him
in
a
passionate
unperceived
emotion
they
had
arrived
at
her
home
and
were
waiting
aimless
and
silent
beyond
the
gate
to
the
yard
was
standing
open
and
nettie
saw
that
his
discovery
of
the
fact
had
occurred
at
the
identical
moment
of
her
own
she
made
an
involuntary
movement
forward
and
he
followed
her
through
to
the
blurred
tangle
of
bushes
and
bare
trodden
earth
mutely
they
turned
to
the
sod
spread
at
the
harbor
the
thunder
had
died
away
but
pale
sheets
of
reflected
lightning
hovered
at
short
intervals
low
in
the
sky
directly
above
them
stars
shone
again
the
window
of
the
sitting
room
still
bore
the
illumination
of
the
lamp
within
and
nettie
could
picture
her
mother
with
stained
and
rough
hands
loose
on
their
wrists
opposite
barzil
dunsack
gaunt
set
countenance
you
said
something
about
things
as
bad
as
possible
in
a
level
voice
she
told
him
about
her
discovery
of
edward
dunsack
unconscious
in
his
black
wrap
on
the
bed
i
thought
he
had
died
she
repeated
almost
monotonously
he
had
such
a
yellow
gone
look
but
that
ca
be
allowed
he
cried
you
must
see
it
indecent
worse
the
beast
will
have
to
be
removed
no
one
will
hear
of
his
staying
about
with
two
women
and
a
fanatical
old
man
she
was
afraid
that
he
would
go
into
the
house
at
once
and
appear
with
her
uncle
very
much
in
the
manner
of
a
dog
with
a
rat
her
sense
of
a
worldly
knowledge
a
philosophy
of
realization
far
deeper
than
his
own
returned
things
could
be
disposed
of
in
that
easy
manner
it
was
probable
that
they
could
be
disposed
of
righted
at
all
her
mother
with
her
help
must
continue
to
keep
barzil
home
there
was
no
other
place
for
edward
dunsack
to
go
he
wo
hurt
us
she
said
vaguely
it
principally
bad
for
him
then
at
first
i
did
know
you
get
used
to
so
much
he
gerrit
ammidon
would
have
it
he
asserted
in
a
heated
return
of
his
familiar
dictatorial
manner
the
fellow
would
be
out
of
there
it
was
a
damned
unendurable
outrage
she
smiled
softly
and
laid
a
momentary
hand
on
his
sleeve
nothing
gerrit
nothing
compared
to
the
rest
to
me
he
frowned
down
at
her
out
of
the
gloom
what
am
i
to
do
she
asked
he
again
cursed
salem
and
the
world
with
which
he
had
proclaimed
himself
out
of
date
and
sympathy
this
while
it
communicated
to
her
a
certain
warm
comfort
resolved
nothing
made
no
reply
to
her
question
offered
precisely
the
same
hopeless
outlook
of
yesterday
no
answer
from
gerrit
gerrit
married
was
possible
she
saw
that
i
not
fit
to
go
around
on
land
blubbering
and
setting
tongues
to
clapping
he
declared
i
ought
to
be
locked
in
my
cabin
when
the
in
port
and
let
out
only
after
sail
made
again
she
heard
a
slight
movement
in
the
grass
and
turning
sharply
caught
the
vague
outline
of
a
man
the
thin
unsubstantial
shape
of
edward
dunsack
he
vanished
immediately
gerrit
absorbed
in
bitter
thought
had
missed
him
strangely
her
uncle
only
filled
her
mind
with
the
image
of
china
the
china
that
had
ruined
him
and
which
too
in
the
form
of
a
woman
a
manchu
had
destroyed
the
hope
of
any
acceptable
existence
of
her
own
great
pretensions
and
idiotic
results
he
went
on
no
ballast
take
what
your
grandfather
said
to
me
nothing
in
that
unexpected
or
to
drive
a
man
off
yet
off
i
go
and
he
halted
oddly
just
as
her
breath
was
suspended
at
the
admittance
which
she
was
certain
must
follow
but
he
fell
into
another
glooming
silence
after
all
she
could
expect
him
to
continue
that
development
a
different
man
might
and
nettie
was
sure
of
her
refusal
to
listen
to
the
end
but
she
was
familiar
with
gerrit
unbending
conception
of
the
necessity
of
truth
alone
if
he
married
a
woman
yellow
black
anything
he
would
perform
the
obligation
to
the
entire
boundary
of
his
promise
good
and
bad
seemed
equally
united
against
her
little
flashes
of
resentment
struck
through
her
leaden
conviction
that
all
this
was
useless
i
must
be
of
some
use
to
you
but
nettie
realized
there
was
only
one
way
in
which
he
could
help
her
only
one
thing
she
wanted
could
take
from
him
she
was
terrified
at
the
completeness
with
which
love
had
possessed
her
making
every
other
fact
and
consideration
of
little
interest
or
importance
suddenly
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
being
swept
by
an
overwhelming
current
farther
and
farther
out
from
safety
into
a
bottomless
immensity
that
would
claim
her
life
yet
he
cried
if
i
lift
a
hand
here
in
salem
if
i
as
much
as
cross
the
street
to
speak
to
you
the
clapping
tongues
i
can
do
you
nothing
but
harm
though
rhoda
might
i
do
want
your
rhoda
she
interrupted
passionately
i
managed
without
them
all
up
to
now
he
raised
his
arms
in
a
hopeless
gesture
nothing
to
be
done
she
concluded
i
saw
that
all
along
that
is
this
last
time
it
late
he
muttered
absently
you
have
had
a
day
he
turned
mechanically
and
moved
away
from
the
indefinite
black
rim
of
the
harbor
the
lamp
in
the
sitting
room
had
been
extinguished
the
house
was
dark
a
brief
embarrassment
seized
her
as
he
stood
trying
vainly
to
find
something
confident
even
adequate
to
say
for
farewell
and
as
the
stir
of
his
footfalls
died
away
up
hardy
street
the
memory
of
his
last
futile
words
mocked
her
laboring
heart
she
turned
and
faced
edward
dunsack
advancing
from
an
obscurity
deeper
than
the
rest
he
murmured
approvingly
she
caught
words
of
commendation
and
unspeakable
reassurance
she
hurried
away
blindly
sick
to
the
inmost
depths
of
her
being
the
morning
when
she
had
tied
her
gay
bonnet
ribbons
and
started
out
with
the
scarlet
merino
shawl
on
her
arm
seemed
to
belong
to
a
long
long
time
ago
to
a
girl
the
popping
of
a
final
string
of
firecrackers
died
outside
viii
the
dejection
the
sense
of
a
difference
that
held
from
him
any
comprehension
of
the
vast
maze
of
shore
life
persisted
as
gerrit
ammidon
walked
toward
home
it
was
such
an
unusual
feeling
that
he
was
conscious
of
it
he
examined
and
speculated
upon
his
despondency
as
if
it
had
been
something
actually
before
him
the
result
of
this
was
a
still
increased
disturbance
he
did
like
such
strange
qualities
arbitrarily
forcing
their
way
into
his
being
he
had
the
navigator
necessity
for
a
clear
understanding
of
the
combined
elements
within
and
without
which
resulted
in
a
harmonious
or
at
least
predictable
movement
he
distrusted
all
fogs
in
a
manner
the
course
before
him
was
plain
married
to
taou
yuen
shipmaster
in
his
family
firm
he
had
simple
duties
to
perform
no
part
of
which
included
sailing
in
strange
or
dangerous
waters
yet
though
this
was
beyond
argument
he
was
still
troubled
by
a
great
number
of
unpleasant
conditions
of
mind
and
obscure
pressures
gradually
however
his
normal
indignation
returned
the
contempt
for
a
society
without
perceptible
justice
centered
principally
in
what
nettie
vollar
had
had
from
life
this
he
assured
himself
was
because
he
was
in
any
way
involved
with
her
but
because
it
was
such
a
flagrant
case
she
was
a
very
nice
girl
it
was
entirely
allowable
that
he
should
admit
that
as
a
fact
he
warmly
felt
that
he
was
her
friend
the
past
justified
no
insisted
on
that
at
least
he
wondered
exactly
how
fond
he
had
been
of
her
in
other
words
how
near
he
had
come
to
marrying
her
it
had
been
an
obvious
possibility
decidedly
but
the
desire
had
never
become
actual
no
his
feeling
for
her
had
never
broken
the
bounds
of
a
natural
liking
and
a
desire
to
secure
decent
treatment
for
her
the
last
had
been
vain
if
his
mental
searching
had
ended
there
it
would
have
presented
no
difficulties
created
no
fog
but
unfortunately
there
was
another
element
which
he
admitted
with
great
reluctance
an
inborn
discomfort
although
he
had
been
clear
about
what
had
actually
happened
with
nettie
there
was
reasonable
doubt
that
the
same
limitations
had
operated
with
her
briefly
she
had
missed
him
more
than
he
had
realized
he
explained
this
to
his
sense
of
innate
masculine
diffidence
by
the
loneliness
of
her
days
she
had
missed
him
within
whispered
that
she
still
did
women
he
remembered
hearing
were
like
that
in
the
light
the
possibility
of
this
he
saw
that
he
had
done
her
a
great
wrong
it
had
been
his
damned
headlong
ignorance
of
the
dangerous
quality
of
life
the
irresponsibility
of
a
child
with
gunpowder
with
all
this
in
his
mind
it
seemed
doubly
imperative
that
he
should
do
something
for
her
he
owed
her
he
was
forced
to
admit
more
than
a
mere
impersonal
consideration
his
thoughts
returned
unbidden
to
the
fact
that
she
she
had
liked
him
he
insisted
almost
angrily
on
the
past
tense
but
it
surprised
him
and
gave
him
a
perceptible
warm
glow
nettie
was
very
pleasing
he
inferred
that
she
was
a
creature
of
deep
emotions
affections
at
this
he
shook
himself
abruptly
such
things
were
not
permissible
gerrit
felt
a
swift
sense
of
shame
they
injured
nettie
his
mind
shifted
to
taou
yuen
he
found
her
asleep
on
the
day
bed
she
preferred
her
elaborate
headdress
resting
above
the
narrow
pillow
of
black
wicker
he
could
distinguish
her
face
pallid
in
the
blue
gloom
and
a
delicate
hand
he
was
flooded
with
the
intense
admiration
which
increasingly
formed
his
chief
thought
of
her
this
with
the
obvious
racial
difference
put
her
as
it
were
on
an
elevation
a
beautifully
lacquered
vase
above
his
own
blundering
person
she
was
calm
serious
and
good
in
the
absolute
western
definitions
of
those
terms
she
had
her
emotions
under
faultless
control
taou
yuen
should
be
an
ideal
wife
for
any
man
she
was
he
corrected
the
form
sharply
all
that
he
knew
of
her
was
admirable
the
part
which
constantly
baffled
him
did
touch
their
relationship
it
was
reasonable
to
expect
small
differences
between
her
and
salem
at
times
her
calm
chilled
him
by
a
swift
glimpse
of
utter
coldness
at
times
he
would
have
liked
her
gravity
to
melt
into
something
less
than
ivory
perfection
even
her
goodness
had
oppressed
him
the
last
had
the
human
quality
of
for
example
nettie
vollar
goodness
colored
by
rebellion
torn
by
doubt
and
yet
triumphing
if
he
only
understood
the
three
religions
of
china
if
he
were
an
intellectual
man
gerrit
realized
he
could
have
grasped
his
wife
more
fully
he
was
completely
ignorant
of
chinese
history
of
all
the
forces
that
had
united
to
form
taou
yuen
for
instance
he
was
unable
to
reconcile
her
elevated
spirit
with
the
absurd
superstitions
that
influenced
almost
her
every
act
the
enormous
number
of
lucky
and
unlucky
days
the
coin
hung
on
his
bed
the
yellow
charm
against
sickness
and
red
against
evil
spirits
only
yesterday
she
had
burnt
a
paper
form
representing
thunder
and
drunk
its
ashes
in
a
cup
of
tea
she
was
tremendously
in
earnest
about
the
evil
spirits
they
were
she
maintained
lurking
everywhere
in
all
shapes
and
degrees
of
harm
edward
dunsack
was
possessed
she
declared
but
he
had
pointed
out
that
opium
was
a
sufficient
explanation
of
anything
evil
in
him
and
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
look
for
a
more
fantastic
reason
he
lay
awake
for
a
comparatively
long
while
as
he
had
several
times
lately
divided
between
his
consciousness
and
the
regular
breathing
of
his
wife
if
the
past
had
brought
nettie
vollar
to
depend
on
him
in
some
slight
degree
taou
yuen
did
so
absolutely
except
for
him
she
was
lost
in
a
strange
world
yet
taou
yuen
did
seem
helpless
in
the
manner
of
nettie
he
had
once
before
thought
of
the
former
as
finely
tempered
metal
her
transcendent
resignation
with
its
consequent
lack
of
sympathetic
contact
with
the
imperfect
humanity
of
well
nettie
gave
taou
yuen
a
dangerous
freedom
from
all
that
bound
salem
in
comparative
safety
he
dressed
first
as
usual
in
the
morning
while
she
stirred
only
enough
to
get
her
pipe
and
tobacco
on
the
floor
at
her
side
outside
the
elms
were
losing
their
fresh
greenness
in
the
dusty
film
of
midsummer
the
square
held
an
ugly
litter
from
the
fireworks
of
last
evening
william
too
was
about
but
he
was
uncommunicative
his
brow
scored
in
a
frown
their
father
always
down
before
the
others
had
returned
from
the
inspection
of
his
trees
and
was
tramping
back
and
forth
in
the
library
the
elder
seemed
unrested
by
the
night
his
skin
as
rhoda
had
pointed
out
was
baggy
now
that
the
is
afloat
again
jeremy
ammidon
said
want
to
be
at
sea
examining
this
natural
conclusion
gerrit
was
surprised
startled
to
find
that
it
was
no
longer
true
for
the
first
time
in
his
memory
he
was
not
anxious
to
be
under
sail
this
of
course
was
caused
by
a
natural
perplexity
about
taou
yuen
comfort
and
happiness
i
do
know
what
the
firm
plans
are
for
me
he
answered
cautiously
there
is
some
talk
of
taking
me
out
of
the
china
trade
for
the
california
runs
i
should
like
that
jeremy
was
turning
at
his
secretary
and
he
stopped
to
pound
his
fist
on
its
narrow
ledge
it
that
damned
griffiths
again
and
his
cursed
jackknife
hull
he
exclaimed
the
dark
tide
suffused
his
countenance
gerrit
studied
him
thoughtfully
he
did
know
just
how
much
william
had
yet
told
their
father
about
the
sweeping
changes
taking
place
in
ammidon
ammidon
and
saltonstone
he
did
see
however
that
it
was
unwise
to
excite
the
old
gentleman
unduly
i
was
saying
only
yesterday
he
put
in
pacifically
that
you
and
myself
are
getting
to
be
old
models
he
broke
off
as
william
entered
the
library
the
latter
evidently
grasped
at
once
the
subject
of
their
discussion
for
he
went
on
in
a
firm
voice
somewhat
contradicted
by
a
restrained
but
palpable
anxiety
now
father
this
was
bound
to
come
up
and
you
must
sit
down
and
listen
quietly
the
elder
on
the
verge
of
a
tempestuous
reply
constrained
himself
to
a
painful
attention
it
useless
to
point
out
to
you
the
beneficial
changes
in
sea
carrying
for
you
are
certain
to
deny
their
good
and
drag
out
the
past
so
i
am
simply
forced
to
tell
you
that
after
careful
consideration
we
have
decided
to
line
the
firm
with
the
events
of
the
day
and
hold
our
place
in
the
growing
pressure
of
competition
this
may
sound
brutal
but
it
was
forced
on
us
by
the
attitude
you
have
adopted
shortly
this
is
what
we
intend
in
fact
are
doing
orders
have
been
placed
with
george
raynes
at
portsmouth
and
jackson
up
in
boston
for
clippers
of
a
thousand
and
twelve
hundred
tons
and
another
is
almost
ready
to
be
launched
from
curtis
chelsea
shipyard
it
to
be
necessary
to
call
your
attention
again
to
the
fact
that
the
has
brought
the
passage
from
hong
kong
to
something
like
three
months
the
profits
of
the
california
trade
will
be
enormous
and
depend
entirely
on
speed
i
admit
that
this
is
a
big
thing
it
will
cut
sharply
into
our
funds
something
like
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
but
if
you
will
be
patient
for
a
little
only
i
can
promise
that
you
see
astonishing
returns
at
the
same
time
we
have
no
intention
of
giving
up
china
and
india
but
we
limit
ourselves
more
closely
in
the
nature
of
the
cargoes
practically
nothing
but
tea
unbroken
from
canton
to
boston
be
glad
to
go
into
all
this
in
detail
at
the
countinghouse
where
we
have
the
statistics
and
specifications
to
gerrit
surprise
jeremy
ammidon
sat
quietly
at
the
end
of
speech
he
was
even
looking
at
them
but
had
his
gaze
bent
upon
the
floor
there
was
a
commanding
even
impressive
quality
in
his
silence
that
forced
the
respect
of
both
his
sons
more
it
made
gerrit
overwhelmingly
conscious
of
his
affection
his
deep
admiration
for
his
father
he
recalled
the
latter
memorable
voyage
in
the
little
the
barque
of
two
hundred
and
nine
tons
into
the
dangers
so
imminent
to
a
master
of
uncomprehended
waters
and
thousands
of
miles
with
for
the
most
part
only
the
sheerest
dead
reckoning
jeremy
ammidon
said
finally
if
it
done
it
done
i
used
to
think
there
were
two
ammidons
in
the
firm
not
to
mention
gerrit
but
it
seems
there
only
one
a
man
who
has
never
been
to
sea
he
rose
and
marched
slower
and
more
ponderous
than
ever
before
to
the
cupboard
where
he
kept
the
square
bottle
of
medford
rum
there
with
trembling
hands
he
poured
himself
out
a
measure
he
shut
the
glass
door
but
stood
for
an
oppressive
space
with
his
back
to
the
room
seeing
that
old
vision
of
struggle
or
accomplishment
i
suppose
i
been
a
damned
nuisance
about
the
countinghouse
for
a
long
time
he
pronounced
turning
william
rose
you
made
it
he
said
it
you
god
forgive
me
if
i
have
been
impatient
or
forgetful
of
all
we
owe
you
there
was
a
stir
of
skirts
in
the
doorway
and
rhoda
entered
breakfast
she
stopped
and
with
a
quick
glance
at
her
husband
and
gerrit
went
at
once
to
jeremy
ammidon
they
been
bothering
you
again
she
declared
and
turned
an
expression
of
bright
anger
on
the
younger
men
ah
how
hard
and
hateful
and
blind
you
are
she
cried
william
with
a
hopeless
gesture
walked
from
the
room
gerrit
moved
to
a
window
facing
the
square
but
he
saw
nothing
of
its
sultry
expanse
he
was
remembering
how
as
a
child
his
mother
already
dead
a
nurse
had
held
him
up
on
derby
wharf
to
see
his
father
sweep
into
port
from
the
long
voyage
to
the
east
he
caught
again
the
resonant
voice
as
if
sounding
from
a
hold
of
ribbed
oak
the
tremendous
vigor
of
the
arm
that
swept
him
up
to
a
bearded
face
he
could
bring
himself
to
move
now
and
see
an
old
haggard
man
clinging
with
tremulous
emotion
and
tears
to
the
sympathy
the
strength
of
a
woman
later
in
the
morning
to
his
immense
relief
jeremy
ammidon
regained
a
surprising
amount
of
composure
at
first
determined
never
to
return
to
liberty
street
toward
noon
gerrit
found
him
in
the
hall
with
his
broad
hat
and
wanghee
i
just
have
a
slant
at
those
specifications
he
remarked
like
as
not
they
left
off
the
hatch
coamings
gerrit
suggested
since
it
so
hot
why
do
you
have
the
carriage
round
the
other
voiced
his
customary
disparagement
of
that
vehicle
if
i
see
that
i
going
to
be
late
for
dinner
he
added
i
get
one
of
the
young
men
to
fetch
me
something
i
do
want
to
give
rhoda
any
trouble
still
on
the
steps
he
lingered
gazing
pridefully
up
at
the
bulk
of
the
house
he
had
built
his
eyes
rested
on
the
brass
plate
engraved
with
the
words
java
head
on
the
dignified
white
door
a
lot
of
talk
when
i
had
that
done
he
commented
people
said
they
never
heard
of
it
ought
to
have
my
name
there
for
convenience
if
nothing
else
they
did
know
it
would
take
a
sailor
for
that
do
forget
to
tell
rhoda
not
to
wait
if
i
late
all
those
girls
of
hers
get
hungry
i
expect
william
consulted
laurel
about
this
new
move
he
ended
with
a
gleam
of
humor
she
a
great
hand
for
a
clipper
since
she
talked
to
captain
waterman
he
was
down
the
steps
starting
deliberately
across
the
street
there
was
a
last
mutter
of
doubt
the
bulky
slow
figure
in
yellow
chinese
silk
moved
away
and
gerrit
returned
to
the
shadowed
tranquillity
of
the
library
more
than
any
other
place
in
the
house
it
bore
the
impression
of
his
father
he
wandered
about
the
room
lost
in
its
associations
stopped
in
front
of
the
tall
narrow
walnut
bookcase
and
took
out
one
of
the
small
company
of
jeremy
ammidon
logs
reading
disconnectedly
in
the
precise
script

he
returned
the
log
to
its
resting
place
with
a
quiet
smile
at
the
last
period
it
was
all
incredibly
simple
a
lost
simplicity
of
navigation
and
a
lost
innocent
wonder
at
the
mare
atlanticum
of
old
fable
neither
william
nor
jeremy
ammidon
was
present
for
dinner
they
were
gerrit
concluded
submerged
in
the
effort
to
bring
the
changing
activities
of
the
firm
into
the
latter
comprehension
his
foot
was
on
the
stair
leading
up
to
his
wife
when
there
was
a
violent
knocking
on
the
front
door
it
sounded
with
a
startling
abruptness
in
the
shut
hall
and
gerrit
instinctively
answered
without
waiting
for
a
servant
the
flushed
and
breathless
young
man
before
him
was
evidently
perturbed
by
his
appearance
he
stammered
captain
ammidon
you
you
must
come
down
to
the
countinghouse
at
once
please
his
thoughts
directed
upon
his
father
gathered
into
a
chilling
certainty
captain
jeremy
is
sick
he
demanded
instantly
the
hesitation
of
the
other
seemed
to
confirm
an
infinitely
greater
calamity
dead
he
asked
again
in
a
flooding
misery
of
apprehension
the
clerk
nodded
in
a
second
like
he
continued
all
we
know
they
were
talking
in
william
ammidon
room
one
of
the
boys
was
out
that
minute
getting
the
old
gentleman
some
lunch
when
we
heard
a
fall
it
was
quite
plain
and
saltonstone
that
will
do
gerrit
cut
him
short
he
turned
into
the
house
rapidly
considering
what
must
follow
he
go
certainly
but
first
he
must
warn
rhoda
she
would
have
the
girls
to
prepare
rhoda
had
always
been
exceptionally
considerate
and
fond
of
jeremy
ammidon
he
found
her
at
the
entrance
to
her
room
and
said
my
father
is
dead
her
warm
color
sank
and
tears
filled
her
eyes
hurrying
over
bath
street
to
liberty
his
grief
was
held
in
check
by
the
pressing
actualities
of
the
moment
he
had
time
however
to
feel
glad
that
he
had
spent
the
morning
largely
in
warm
thoughts
of
the
dead
man
he
passed
rapidly
into
the
entrance
of
the
establishment
of
ammidon
ammidon
and
saltonstone
immediately
on
the
right
there
was
an
open
railed
enclosure
of
desks
in
the
center
of
which
a
group
of
clerks
watched
him
with
mingled
respect
and
curiosity
as
he
continued
to
the
inner
shut
space
it
was
a
large
light
room
with
windows
on
charter
street
william
expansive
desk
with
its
inked
green
baize
was
on
the
left
and
under
a
number
of
framed
sere
ships
letters
and
privateersmen
bonds
of
the
war
of
gerrit
saw
the
heavy
body
extended
on
a
broad
wooden
bench
a
familiar
orange
bombay
handkerchief
spread
over
the
face
never
in
all
the
memory
of
his
brother
had
william
ammidon
been
so
stricken
as
he
entered
james
saltonstone
left
studying
a
list
hastily
scribbled
on
a
half
sheet
of
the
firm
writing
paper
he
nodded
silently
to
gerrit
who
advanced
to
the
covered
face
and
lifted
the
handkerchief
there
were
still
traces
of
congestion
but
a
marblelike
pallor
had
taken
the
place
of
the
familiar
ruddy
color
something
of
the
heaviness
of
his
old
age
the
blurring
thickness
of
long
inactivity
had
vanished
giving
his
still
countenance
an
expression
of
vigor
resolution
contradicted
by
an
arm
trailing
like
the
loose
end
of
a
heavy
rope
on
the
floor
william
with
a
clenched
hand
on
his
desk
spoke
with
difficulty
you
must
know
this
gerrit
and
then
i
ask
you
never
to
allude
to
it
again
it
might
be
argued
that
that
james
and
i
killed
him
but
absolutely
without
intention
by
accident
gerrit
i
loved
him
more
than
i
took
time
to
know
well
you
may
or
may
not
have
heard
that
we
own
two
topsail
schooners
in
the
opium
trade
between
india
ningpo
and
amoy
but
you
do
know
how
father
detested
anything
to
do
with
the
drug
we
said
nothing
to
him
about
this
it
seemed
necessary
no
permissible
but
when
we
were
coming
to
a
peaceable
understanding
about
the
new
contracts
he
stumbled
over
one
of
the
schooner
manifests
mislaid
you
see
a
clerk
it
swept
him
to
his
feet
in
a
rage
he
could
speak
and
and
he
had
walked
it
was
hot
gerrit
ammidon
made
no
answer
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
he
was
shaken
by
a
burning
anger
at
the
cupidity
the
ugly
commercial
grasping
to
which
his
father
had
been
sacrificed
a
gulf
opened
between
him
and
his
brother
and
james
saltonstone
he
was
as
different
from
them
as
the
sea
was
from
the
land
as
the
deck
of
the
was
from
this
dry
building
with
its
stifling
papers
and
greed
he
might
be
in
the
service
of
the
firm
gerrit
was
not
incorporated
in
the
partnership
he
might
carry
their
cargoes
for
the
multiplication
of
the
profit
but
his
essential
service
and
responsibility
his
life
were
addressed
to
another
and
infinitely
higher
and
more
difficult
consummation
than
the
stowed
kegs
of
spanish
dollars
the
bills
of
sale
this
was
composed
of
the
struggle
with
the
immeasurable
elements
of
the
seas
and
winds
the
safety
of
lives
the
endless
trying
of
his
endurance
and
will
and
luck
now
he
spoke
with
a
perceptible
bitterness
you
can
have
your
way
without
interference
without
his
mixing
up
your
papers
or
making
the
blunders
of
a
slow
sort
of
honesty
i
am
under
no
obligation
to
your
judgment
or
opinion
william
replied
stiffly
there
are
always
complications
you
will
never
penetrate
nor
carry
at
present
your
assistance
is
more
necessary
than
any
display
of
temper
the
funeral
gathered
and
ebbed
in
a
long
procession
of
carriages
through
a
sultry
noon
the
services
at
the
grave
concluded
by
the
symbolic
dropping
of
the
earth
on
jeremy
ammidon
coffin
lowered
into
the
deep
narrow
clay
pit
the
large
varied
throng
lingered
for
a
breath
as
if
unable
to
take
their
attention
from
the
raw
opening
that
had
absorbed
the
shipmaster
and
then
there
was
a
determined
and
reassuring
commonplace
murmur
a
hurrying
away
into
the
vital
warmth
of
the
day
the
evening
was
the
loveliest
summer
and
the
garden
of
java
head
could
afford
a
slow
moon
disentangled
itself
from
the
indigo
foliage
at
the
back
of
the
stable
and
soared
with
an
increasing
brilliancy
bathing
the
sod
and
summerhouse
and
poplars
the
metallic
box
borders
and
spiked
flower
beds
in
a
crystal
clearness
the
ammidons
sat
about
the
willow
rhoda
with
a
hand
affectionately
on
her
husband
arm
the
children
laurel
and
janet
staying
without
remark
long
past
their
accustomed
hours
for
bed
still
and
white
under
the
blanching
moon
gerrit
intently
studied
his
wife
taou
yuen
in
a
concentrated
manner
she
too
was
in
white
the
chinese
mark
of
sorrow
suddenly
in
the
face
of
his
suffering
and
memories
she
had
appeared
startlingly
remote
as
if
from
standing
close
beside
him
she
were
moving
farther
and
farther
away
the
image
was
made
profoundly
disconcerting
by
the
fact
that
they
acted
without
their
own
accord
it
took
the
aspect
of
a
purely
arbitrary
phenomenon
over
which
they
had
no
control
at
the
same
time
nettie
vollar
was
surprisingly
near
actual
he
could
see
every
line
and
shading
of
her
vivid
face
he
felt
the
warm
impact
of
her
instant
sympathy
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
barzil
dunsack
at
the
funeral
but
the
other
was
immediately
hidden
by
the
crowd
and
gerrit
had
been
unable
to
discover
whether
his
son
and
daughter
or
nettie
had
accompanied
him
his
thoughts
turned
in
a
score
of
associations
and
questions
to
nettie
but
when
he
found
himself
trying
to
picture
her
exact
employment
at
the
present
moment
he
was
angrily
aroused
he
had
he
realized
considered
nothing
else
for
the
past
hour
and
his
preoccupation
was
growing
more
intense
personal
he
stirred
abruptly
and
fixed
his
mind
on
the
imminent
changes
from
his
father
death
first
the
possibility
would
develop
of
his
becoming
a
member
of
the
firm
but
to
this
he
silently
declared
he
would
not
agree
his
gaze
rested
with
a
faint
underlying
animosity
on
william
seated
upright
in
a
somber
absorption
and
a
disparagement
of
the
latter
activities
and
scale
of
values
gerrit
saw
that
there
must
be
a
pacific
legal
knot
to
untangle
the
division
of
jeremy
estate
would
require
time
he
had
somewhere
heard
that
such
affairs
often
dragged
on
for
a
year
and
now
he
was
again
in
a
fever
of
impatience
to
be
away
safe
at
sea
he
added
the
more
portentous
word
with
the
vague
that
it
was
only
the
customary
expression
of
his
notable
ignorance
of
land
but
it
echoed
with
an
ominous
special
insistence
in
his
mind
the
he
recalled
was
once
more
afloat
repaired
and
a
plan
occurred
to
him
that
seemed
to
dispose
of
all
his
difficulties
even
of
the
distasteful
possibility
of
the
california
clipper
service
he
could
take
the
ship
as
part
of
his
inheritance
and
though
ostensibly
sailing
her
in
the
interest
of
the
firm
make
such
voyages
and
ports
carry
such
cargoes
as
his
independence
dictated
the
with
a
cargo
out
of
tin
and
dyes
and
cotton
manufactures
and
forty
or
fifty
thousand
trade
dollars
would
represent
a
sum
of
nearly
two
hundred
thousand
but
as
a
family
they
were
very
rich
he
have
more
than
that
and
bank
the
remainder
intact
to
the
credit
of
his
wife
there
were
many
practical
aspects
of
his
marriage
that
he
had
not
stopped
to
weigh
in
its
precipitant
consummation
the
problem
pointed
out
by
rhoda
of
his
absence
from
taou
yuen
on
cruise
could
not
be
solved
with
the
facility
he
had
taken
for
granted
it
was
as
impossible
to
leave
her
happily
here
he
was
aware
of
her
growing
impatience
with
western
habit
as
it
would
be
for
him
to
become
a
contented
part
of
chinese
home
life
and
not
only
was
she
uncomfortably
cramped
and
sick
on
shipboard
but
he
doubted
whether
he
could
persuade
his
crews
to
sail
with
her
superstitious
able
seamen
balked
at
the
presence
of
even
a
normal
wife
aft
and
a
chinese
would
be
regarded
as
a
sign
of
certain
disaster
he
would
have
to
establish
her
somewhere
in
the
east
indies
and
he
viewed
with
a
new
dislike
all
such
tropical
settings
his
entire
life
threatened
to
become
an
affair
of
damnable
palm
trees
and
oriental
stenches
gerrit
ammidon
broke
into
a
cold
sweat
at
the
realization
of
the
far
more
direct
implication
that
had
taken
substance
in
his
mind
the
thing
was
going
entirely
too
far
he
wondered
irritably
at
the
obscure
cause
for
such
violent
inner
agitations
rhoda
ammidon
with
a
dim
smile
rose
gathering
her
daughters
about
her
and
departed
in
a
pale
cloud
of
muslin
taou
yuen
with
her
murmuring
formal
politeness
moved
away
too
leaving
the
brothers
together
whatever
sympathetic
intercourse
they
might
otherwise
have
had
whatever
shared
memories
of
their
boyhood
and
their
father
were
made
impossible
by
william
admission
of
the
immediate
cause
of
the
elder
death
the
saltonstones
are
going
into
boston
this
fall
william
said
abruptly
it
is
necessary
for
one
of
us
to
live
there
and
caroline
has
always
had
a
hankering
for
wider
society
rhoda
i
was
surprised
to
learn
wishes
to
remain
here
at
java
head
for
a
year
or
so
anyway
she
has
a
very
real
affection
for
the
place
but
i
tell
her
when
the
girls
are
older
boston
or
perhaps
new
york
will
give
them
far
greater
opportunities
sidsall
stranger
still
was
in
tears
at
the
whole
thing
she
seemed
ridiculously
upset
about
leaving
the
vision
of
nettie
vollar
persisted
bright
and
disturbing
once
he
was
at
sea
gerrit
told
himself
on
the
circumscribed
freedom
of
his
he
would
lose
the
unsettling
fever
burning
at
that
instant
in
his
veins
but
the
memory
of
long
solitary
passages
with
nothing
to
distract
his
mind
through
week
upon
week
after
the
ship
took
the
trades
when
hour
upon
hour
his
thoughts
turned
inward
on
themselves
and
reviewed
every
past
act
and
feeling
made
doubtful
even
that
old
release
the
trouble
was
that
he
instinctively
avoided
any
square
facing
of
the
difficulty
that
had
multiplied
with
such
amazing
rapidity
like
a
banyan
tree
about
the
present
and
the
shadowed
future
this
he
was
forced
to
admit
but
grimly
added
that
there
could
be
only
one
answer
to
whatever
he
might
lay
bare
the
adherence
to
the
single
fundamental
duty
of
which
he
never
lost
sight
no
port
was
gained
by
changing
blindly
from
course
to
course
that
way
lay
the
reefs
a
man
could
but
keep
steadily
by
the
compass
that
at
least
was
all
he
could
see
propose
for
himself
being
rather
limited
and
lacking
the
resources
which
others
of
greater
knowledge
so
confidently
explored
after
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
he
mounted
the
dignified
staircase
with
the
sweeping
railing
of
red
narra
wood
and
high
palladian
window
at
the
turn
to
his
wife
in
their
room
he
was
bathed
in
a
cold
sweat
of
dismay
at
a
sudden
detached
view
of
taou
yuen
in
her
complete
manchu
mourning
for
his
father
an
unhemmed
garment
of
coarse
white
hemp
hung
in
ravelings
about
slippers
of
sackcloth
what
had
been
an
elaborate
headdress
was
hidden
under
a
binding
of
the
bleached
hemp
she
wore
no
paint
nor
flowers
her
pins
and
earrings
were
pasted
with
dough
and
her
expression
was
drugged
with
the
contemplative
fervor
of
what
had
evidently
been
a
religious
ceremonial
for
the
wise
old
man
for
your
father
she
said
she
was
exhausted
and
sank
onto
the
day
bed
but
almost
immediately
her
hand
reached
out
in
the
direction
of
her
pipe
and
she
smiled
faintly
at
him
he
clenched
his
sinewy
hands
the
muscles
of
his
jaw
knotted
as
he
gazed
steadily
at
the
woman
the
manchu
woman
he
had
of
his
own
free
accord
married
it
sickened
him
that
for
the
drawing
of
a
breath
he
had
regarded
taou
yuen
with
such
appalling
injustice
injustice
the
evil
he
hated
and
condemned
more
than
any
other
what
in
the
name
of
god
was
he
made
of
that
he
could
sink
so
low
we
leave
here
soon
he
declared
abruptly
the
will
be
ready
for
sea
almost
any
time
he
could
recognize
from
his
slight
knowledge
of
her
that
taou
yuen
welcomed
the
news
shanghai
she
asked
he
nodded
it
came
over
him
that
he
was
no
longer
young
his
father
had
retired
from
the
sea
within
a
few
years
of
his
own
present
age
and
built
java
head
the
house
that
was
to
be
a
final
harbor
of
unalloyed
happiness
no
such
prospect
awaited
him
he
had
one
of
the
premonitions
that
were
more
certain
than
the
most
solid
realities
as
long
as
he
lived
he
must
sail
in
ships
struggling
with
winds
and
calms
with
currents
and
cockling
and
placid
seas
well
that
was
natural
inevitable
what
he
would
have
chosen
at
the
same
time
he
dwelt
with
a
sensation
of
loneliness
on
the
green
garden
and
filled
in
june
with
the
scent
of
lilacs
on
rhoda
surrounded
by
her
girls
when
the
question
of
the
division
of
jeremy
amnudon
estate
came
up
he
was
as
he
had
foreseen
urged
to
become
a
partner
of
the
firm
and
when
that
failed
told
that
it
was
his
vested
duty
to
continue
in
his
present
capacity
as
a
shipmaster
in
all
their
interests
he
was
seated
with
saltonstone
and
william
in
the
countinghouse
and
he
could
tell
from
his
brother
impatience
that
the
other
considered
him
hardly
more
than
a
stubborn
fool
before
the
mast
of
the
facts
of
actual
life
his
gaze
above
their
heads
rested
on
the
framed
pass
of
the
ship
one
of
his
father
last
commands
over
the
bench
where
he
had
lain
dead
it
was
given
by
the
president
james
monroe
in
its
white
paper
seal
embossed
on
the
stained
parchment
it
had
an
engraving
of
a
lighthouse
and
spired
town
on
the
dark
water
edge
and
above
a
picture
of
a
ship
with
everything
drawing
in
a
fair
wind
the
upper
sails
torn
off
on
a
dotted
wavering
line
for
the
purpose
of
identification
with
its
stub
no
he
told
them
quietly
i
go
my
own
way
as
i
said
with
the
if
that
can
be
arranged
he
rose
with
a
nod
of
finality
and
james
saltonstone
remarked
jeremy
to
the
life
gerrit
replied
not
ask
anything
better
through
the
evening
he
heard
little
but
the
discussion
of
mr
approaching
visit
to
salem
the
president
was
to
leave
the
train
at
the
beverly
depot
at
three
and
be
fetched
with
secretary
buchanan
and
marshal
barnes
in
a
barouche
with
six
horses
and
met
at
the
outskirts
of
salem
by
the
city
authorities
there
would
be
a
beverly
cavalcade
the
city
guard
was
ordered
to
muster
at
the
armory
while
an
evening
parade
at
five
and
the
military
ball
in
franklin
hall
were
to
follow
but
when
the
day
and
occasion
actually
arrived
it
was
spoiled
by
a
succession
of
unforeseen
mishaps
the
train
was
late
and
the
presidential
party
in
a
fever
of
haste
the
procession
hurrying
through
the
massed
children
and
throngs
of
chestnut
street
gave
a
perfunctory
attention
to
the
salutes
and
short
address
of
the
mayor
the
reply
hardly
more
than
a
few
introductory
phrases
cut
short
the
barouche
was
sent
plunging
over
its
route
with
the
secretary
crying
drive
on
drive
on
and
marshal
barnes
swearing
and
expectorating
in
callous
profusion
some
of
the
crowd
the
ammidons
heard
had
been
knocked
down
and
injured
in
the
of
the
rush
gerrit
countenance
showed
his
contempt
of
what
he
held
to
be
a
characteristically
ludicrous
farce
after
all
his
wishes
in
regard
to
the
had
been
easy
of
execution
the
ship
was
now
his
he
was
already
contracting
for
a
cargo
he
had
been
to
see
broadrick
his
first
mate
and
the
latter
was
assembling
the
chief
members
of
the
crew
as
always
at
the
prospect
of
sailing
he
was
unsettled
concerned
with
countless
details
of
departure
like
a
vessel
straining
at
her
last
anchor
seated
in
the
library
with
taou
yuen
he
had
called
her
aside
from
her
fixed
passage
to
their
room
from
the
garden
he
was
recounting
his
main
plans
for
the
near
future
when
he
became
aware
of
an
arrival
on
the
steps
outside
he
heard
a
servant
voice
and
immediately
after
the
woman
appeared
in
the
doorway
but
she
was
forced
aside
by
edward
dunsack
gerrit
quick
resentment
flared
at
such
an
unmannered
intrusion
and
he
moved
ungraciously
forward
the
servant
explained
impotently
i
told
him
i
would
see
yes
gerrit
ammidon
demanded
dunsack
bowed
ceremoniously
to
taou
yuen
then
he
faced
the
other
on
the
verge
of
speech
he
hesitated
as
if
an
unexpected
development
made
inadequate
whatever
he
had
been
prepared
to
say
then
with
a
sudden
decision
he
hurried
into
an
emotional
jumble
of
words
i
can
tell
you
in
a
breath
nettie
was
badly
hurt
in
that
cursed
rabble
yesterday
it
looks
as
if
she
was
actually
struck
by
one
of
the
horses
she
was
unconscious
and
then
delirious
now
she
is
in
her
right
mind
but
very
weak
and
since
she
wished
to
see
you
i
volunteered
to
put
our
pride
in
my
pocket
and
carry
her
message
an
instant
numbing
pain
compressed
gerrit
heart
he
felt
that
in
an
involuntary
exclamation
he
had
clearly
shown
the
depth
of
his
dismay
damn
the
fellow
why
had
he
burst
out
in
this
public
indecent
manner
the
situation
he
had
plausibly
created
the
thing
he
managed
to
insinuate
was
an
insult
to
them
all
to
his
wife
taou
yuen
coldly
composed
beyond
himself
and
to
nettie
he
stood
with
his
level
gaze
fixed
in
an
enraged
perplexity
on
edward
dunsack
sallow
countenance
deep
sunk
on
its
bony
structure
conscious
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
satisfactory
or
even
coherent
reply
something
was
said
about
this
afternoon
the
other
added
that
period
gerrit
realized
was
nearly
over
but
above
every
other
consideration
rose
the
knowledge
that
he
would
have
to
see
nettie
vollar
badly
injured
as
she
desired
the
common
humanity
of
that
necessity
left
him
no
choice
he
turned
to
taou
yuen
with
a
brief
formal
explanation
a
friend
their
families
had
been
associated
for
years
had
been
hurt
and
sent
for
him
return
immediately
he
paused
in
the
act
of
leaving
at
the
door
of
the
library
waiting
for
edward
dunsack
to
join
him
but
the
other
had
resolutely
turned
his
back
upon
gerrit
he
showed
no
indication
of
departure
gerrit
ammidon
was
at
the
point
of
an
exasperated
direction
but
that
in
the
light
of
dunsack
purpose
there
appeared
ridiculously
abrupt
and
confident
of
his
wife
supreme
ability
to
control
any
situation
he
continued
without
further
hesitation
to
the
street
hurrying
in
a
mounting
anxiety
toward
the
dunsacks
dwelling
on
his
conduct
in
the
library
at
the
sudden
announcement
of
nettie
accident
he
felt
that
he
had
acted
in
a
precipitant
if
not
actually
confused
way
as
a
fact
it
had
all
been
largely
mechanical
his
oppression
his
dread
for
nettie
had
made
everything
else
dim
to
see
and
faint
to
hear
dunsack
grimacing
face
the
immobile
figure
of
his
wife
the
familiar
sweep
of
the
room
had
been
things
of
no
more
substance
than
a
cloud
between
him
and
the
only
other
reality
existing
he
had
no
memory
for
instance
of
having
stopped
to
secure
his
hat
but
he
found
it
swinging
characteristically
in
a
hand
and
now
even
the
semblance
of
reasonable
speech
and
conduct
he
had
managed
to
command
vanished
before
a
panic
that
all
but
forced
him
into
a
run
the
main
door
of
barzil
dunsack
house
was
open
on
the
narrow
somber
region
within
he
knocked
sharply
against
the
wood
at
the
side
and
was
immediately
answered
by
the
appearance
of
kate
vollar
this
is
a
great
kindness
captain
ammidon
she
told
him
in
her
negative
voice
come
in
here
please
he
looked
hastily
about
the
formal
space
into
which
she
led
him
expecting
to
see
nettie
prostrate
but
she
was
not
there
how
is
she
he
demanded
impatiently
nettie
her
mother
turned
as
if
surprised
by
an
unexpected
twist
of
the
situation
oh
why
she
mend
all
right
the
doctor
says
but
it
will
be
slow
her
arm
had
an
ugly
slithering
break
and
she
suffers
with
it
all
the
time
a
pause
followed
in
which
she
met
his
interrogation
with
a
growing
mystification
i
suppose
edward
told
you
she
ventured
finally
the
sense
of
being
at
a
loss
was
swiftly
communicated
to
him
your
brother
said
nettie
wanted
to
see
me
he
returned
bluntly
now
however
could
edward
do
a
thing
like
that
she
cried
in
deep
distress
why
there
no
truth
to
it
i
asked
him
myself
to
see
if
you
kindly
stop
and
give
me
some
advice
what
put
it
in
my
head
was
that
once
your
father
offered
he
told
nettie
to
let
him
know
if
there
was
anything
to
be
done
edward
dunsack
is
just
right
in
his
head
gerrit
was
filled
with
a
mingling
sense
of
disappointment
relief
that
nettie
was
no
worse
and
the
uncomfortable
conviction
that
he
had
behaved
like
an
hysterical
fool
he
too
but
angrily
wondered
why
dunsack
had
invented
such
an
apparently
pointless
lie
probably
kate
vollar
was
right
and
her
brother
wits
soaked
in
opium
had
wandered
into
a
realm
of
insane
fabrications
he
composed
himself
the
first
feeling
blotting
out
his
other
emotions
to
meet
the
deprecating
interrogation
before
him
i
should
be
glad
to
do
what
i
could
in
my
father
place
in
a
way
she
continued
it
about
edward
when
he
came
back
from
china
and
decided
to
stay
in
salem
his
father
turned
all
the
books
over
to
him
he
was
to
tend
to
everything
in
the
way
of
accounts
and
shipments
and
he
said
he
would
make
us
all
rich
in
a
year
or
so
but
instead
he
has
neglected
the
clerking
until
we
ca
tell
what
going
or
coming
edward
has
has
quite
been
himself
lately
she
paused
and
gerrit
nodded
shortly
now
we
not
wealthy
captain
ammidon
we
never
got
more
than
just
enough
from
our
west
india
trade
but
in
the
last
couple
of
months
with
edward
like
he
is
and
father
too
old
for
columns
of
figuring
he
dreadful
forgetful
now
not
a
dollar
was
made
the
schooners
are
slow
behind
the
times
i
guess
we
had
to
scrape
yet
it
been
something
they
both
awful
hard
to
do
with
she
stopped
hopelessly
you
must
get
a
reliable
man
in
charge
some
one
who
knows
the
west
india
shipping
should
go
over
your
entire
property
decide
what
is
necessary
then
borrow
the
money
we
can
find
that
without
trouble
i
make
only
one
condition
that
is
the
complete
restraint
of
your
brother
it
is
known
that
he
has
the
opium
habit
he
is
a
dangerous
he
stopped
at
the
echo
of
a
thin
persistent
tapping
from
above
nettie
kate
vollar
said
the
way
she
calls
me
i
ask
you
to
excuse
me
for
a
minute
when
she
returned
her
face
bore
an
unaccustomed
flush
nettie
heard
you
in
the
hall
or
through
the
stovepipe
she
spoke
doubtfully
she
like
to
see
you
but
i
do
know
if
it
would
be
right
with
her
in
bed
still
i
promised
i
tell
you
he
rose
promptly
the
woman
stood
aside
at
the
upper
door
and
he
at
once
saw
nettie
lying
with
her
vigorous
black
hair
sprawling
in
a
thick
twist
across
the
pillow
her
face
was
pinched
it
seemed
thin
and
the
brilliancy
and
size
of
her
eyes
were
exaggerated
one
arm
clumsy
and
inanimate
in
splints
was
extended
over
the
cotton
spread
but
with
the
other
hand
she
was
feverishly
busy
with
her
appearance
she
smiled
a
wan
tremulous
movement
that
again
shut
the
pain
like
a
leaden
casket
about
his
heart
do
go
away
mother
nettie
directed
kate
vollar
hovering
behind
them
your
fidgeting
will
make
me
scream
with
an
incoherent
murmur
she
vanished
from
the
room
the
girl
motioned
toward
a
chair
and
gerrit
drew
it
forward
to
a
table
that
bore
water
and
a
small
glass
bowl
partly
covered
by
a
sheet
of
paper
holding
a
number
of
symmetrical
pills
opium
nettie
told
him
following
his
gaze
i
cried
dreadfully
with
the
hurt
at
first
it
dear
and
edward
made
those
from
some
he
had
you
know
i
watched
him
roll
them
right
here
it
was
wonderful
how
quickly
he
did
it
each
exactly
alike
two
grains
she
told
him
the
circumstances
of
her
accident
while
he
sat
with
his
eyes
steadily
on
her
face
his
hands
folded
he
was
quiet
without
visible
emotion
or
speech
but
there
was
an
utter
tumult
a
tumult
like
the
spiral
of
a
hurricane
within
him
rebellious
feelings
tyrannical
desires
and
thoughts
swept
through
him
in
waves
of
heat
and
cold
nettie
voice
grew
weak
the
shadows
deepened
under
her
eyes
for
a
little
they
closed
and
but
for
the
faint
stir
of
the
coverlet
over
her
heart
she
was
so
pallid
so
still
that
she
might
have
been
dead
moved
by
an
uncontrollable
fear
he
bent
toward
her
and
touched
her
hand
her
gaze
slowly
widened
and
turning
over
her
palm
she
weakly
grasped
his
fingers
a
great
sigh
of
contentment
fluttered
from
her
dry
lips
gerrit
she
whispered
barely
audible
he
leaned
forward
blinded
by
his
passion
for
her
he
admitted
this
in
an
honest
that
he
had
refused
recognition
until
now
tender
and
reassuring
words
wild
declarations
and
plans
for
the
future
crowded
for
expression
nothing
else
before
the
immensity
of
desire
that
possessed
him
was
of
the
slightest
concern
but
not
a
syllable
was
spoken
a
sharp
line
was
ploughed
between
his
brows
his
breath
came
in
short
choked
gusts
he
was
utterly
the
vessel
of
his
longing
and
yet
an
ultimate
basic
consideration
lost
in
the
pounding
of
his
veins
still
restrained
him
i
love
you
gerrit
nettie
said
i
never
stop
till
i
die
her
face
and
voice
were
almost
tranquil
she
seemed
to
speak
from
a
plane
above
the
ordinary
necessities
of
common
existence
as
if
her
pain
burning
out
her
color
and
vigor
and
emotions
had
given
her
the
privilege
of
truth
curiously
enough
when
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
had
expressed
what
should
have
sent
him
into
a
single
consuming
flame
he
grew
at
once
completely
calm
he
too
for
the
moment
reached
her
state
of
freedom
from
earth
and
flesh
i
love
you
nettie
he
replied
simply
however
he
speedily
dropped
back
into
the
sphere
of
actual
responsibilities
he
saw
all
the
difficulties
and
hovering
insidious
shadows
in
which
they
might
be
lost
this
in
turn
was
pushed
aside
by
the
incredulous
realization
that
nettie
life
and
his
had
been
spoiled
by
a
thing
no
more
important
than
a
momentary
flare
of
temper
if
as
might
have
happened
he
had
overlooked
barzil
dunsack
ridiculous
tirade
if
he
had
turned
into
the
yard
where
nettie
was
standing
instead
of
tramping
away
up
hardy
street
everything
would
have
been
well
it
was
unjust
he
cried
inwardly
for
such
infinite
consequences
to
proceed
from
unthinking
anger
a
great
or
tragic
result
should
spring
from
great
or
tragic
causes
the
suffering
and
price
measured
by
the
error
he
could
see
that
nettie
was
patiently
waiting
for
him
to
solve
the
whole
miserable
problem
of
their
future
she
had
an
expression
of
relief
which
seemed
to
take
a
happy
issue
for
granted
none
was
possible
a
baffled
rage
cut
his
speech
into
quick
brutal
words
flung
like
shot
against
her
hope
i
love
you
he
repeated
yes
but
what
can
that
do
for
us
now
i
had
my
chance
and
i
let
it
go
i
married
i
be
married
probably
till
i
die
perhaps
that
would
stop
a
man
more
intelligent
it
might
be
just
that
than
i
am
perhaps
he
go
right
after
his
love
or
happiness
wherever
or
however
it
offered
there
are
men
too
who
have
the
habit
of
a
number
of
women
that
is
understood
to
be
a
custom
with
sailors
it
has
never
been
with
me
as
i
say
maybe
i
am
too
stupid
what
in
the
name
of
all
the
heavens
would
i
do
with
taou
yuen
he
demanded
i
ca
desert
her
here
in
america
leave
her
with
william
i
brought
her
thousands
of
miles
away
from
her
home
from
all
she
knows
and
is
if
i
took
her
back
and
dropped
her
in
china
it
would
be
murder
an
expression
of
unalloyed
dreariness
overspread
nettie
features
i
wish
i
had
been
killed
right
out
she
said
the
starkness
of
the
words
of
the
reality
they
spoke
flowed
over
him
like
icy
water
he
felt
that
he
was
sinking
strangling
in
a
sea
grimmer
than
any
about
cape
horn
he
was
continually
appalled
by
the
realization
that
there
was
no
escape
no
smallest
glimmer
leading
from
the
pit
into
which
they
had
stumbled
he
had
the
sensation
of
wanting
enormously
to
go
with
nettie
but
was
fast
in
chains
that
were
locked
on
him
by
a
power
greater
than
his
will
it
no
good
his
voice
was
flat
i
do
believe
i
see
you
again
nettie
articulated
now
the
is
near
ready
to
sail
i
ca
stand
it
she
sobbed
that
last
time
you
went
out
the
harbor
just
about
ended
me
but
this
is
worse
worse
worse
i
i
take
all
the
opium
no
you
wo
he
asserted
standing
confident
that
her
spirit
was
too
normal
too
vitally
healthy
for
that
his
gaze
wandered
about
the
room
her
clothes
were
neatly
piled
and
covered
by
a
skirt
on
a
chair
the
mirror
on
her
chest
of
drawers
was
broken
a
corner
missing
there
was
a
total
absence
of
the
delicate
toilet
adjuncts
of
rhoda
and
taou
yuen
only
a
small
paper
of
powder
a
comb
and
brush
and
the
washstand
with
a
couple
of
coarse
towels
what
dresses
she
had
were
hung
behind
a
ridiculously
inadequate
drapery
she
had
so
little
with
which
to
accomplish
what
for
a
girl
was
so
much
his
emotion
had
retreated
leaving
him
heavy
of
movement
the
moment
had
come
for
his
departure
gerrit
stood
by
the
bed
nettie
turned
away
from
him
her
face
was
buried
in
the
pillow
the
uppermost
free
shoulder
shook
he
said
there
was
no
answer
and
he
patiently
repeated
the
short
tragic
phrase
still
there
was
no
sound
from
nettie
there
would
be
none
even
the
impulse
to
touch
her
had
died
died
he
thought
with
a
great
many
feelings
and
hopes
he
once
had
a
fleet
surprise
invaded
him
at
the
absence
of
any
impulse
now
to
protest
or
indulge
in
wild
passionate
terms
he
was
surprised
too
at
the
fact
that
he
was
about
to
leave
nettie
the
whole
termination
of
the
affair
was
bathed
in
an
atmosphere
of
stale
calm
like
the
air
in
a
ship
hold
gerrit
ammidon
gazed
steadily
at
her
averted
head
at
the
generous
line
of
her
body
under
the
coverlet
then
neither
hasty
nor
hesitating
in
his
walk
he
left
the
room
kate
vollar
met
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
you
understood
she
said
that
i
only
bothered
you
because
your
father
because
i
was
so
put
on
you
were
quite
right
he
replied
in
a
measured
voice
it
will
all
be
attended
to
with
the
agreement
i
mentioned
how
they
take
it
i
do
know
in
some
positions
he
told
her
certain
persons
are
without
any
choice
the
facts
are
too
great
for
them
i
said
nothing
to
nettie
of
edward
dunsack
reason
for
my
coming
he
added
significantly
out
in
the
street
he
stopped
facing
toward
java
head
and
evening
but
with
a
quiver
of
his
lips
the
vertical
bitter
line
between
his
drawn
brows
he
turned
and
marched
slowly
his
head
sunk
to
where
the
was
berthed
ix
seated
in
the
library
placidly
waiting
for
edward
dunsack
to
go
taou
yuen
studied
him
briefly
a
long
or
thoughtful
survey
was
unnecessary
the
opium
was
rapidly
mastering
him
that
fact
absorbed
all
the
rest
she
had
an
immeasurable
contempt
for
such
physical
and
moral
weakness
all
the
three
religions
fused
in
her
overwhelmingly
condemned
her
philosophy
the
practical
side
of
teaching
emphasized
the
utter
futility
of
surrender
to
the
five
senses
at
the
same
time
he
was
the
subject
of
some
interest
he
was
an
american
who
had
lived
in
china
and
not
only
on
the
fringe
of
the
treaty
ports
he
had
penetrated
to
some
extent
into
the
spirit
the
life
of
things
chinese
while
she
taou
yuen
was
amazingly
married
to
gerrit
ammidon
was
a
manchu
here
in
america
absolutely
immobile
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
she
considered
these
facts
each
in
relation
to
the
other
there
was
wisdom
hidden
in
them
for
her
if
dunsack
had
retained
the
ordinary
blustering
western
commercial
mind
his
knowledge
of
china
confined
to
the
tea
houses
and
streets
he
would
probably
be
prosperous
and
strong
the
wisdom
lay
in
this
that
here
she
must
remain
manchu
chinese
any
attempt
to
become
a
part
of
this
incomprehensible
country
any
effort
to
involve
herself
in
its
mysterious
acts
or
thought
would
be
disastrous
she
must
remain
calm
unassertive
let
the
eternal
tao
take
its
way
edward
dunsack
looked
actually
comic
he
was
staring
rudely
with
a
foolish
air
of
flattery
and
breathing
in
labored
gasps
like
a
coolie
who
had
run
miles
with
a
heavy
palanquin
then
her
mind
hardly
reacting
from
immediate
objects
returned
to
the
contemplation
of
the
deeper
significance
of
her
presence
here
bent
in
on
itself
her
thought
twisted
like
a
moonflower
vine
about
the
solid
fact
of
gerrit
she
realized
of
course
that
he
must
have
had
the
past
of
any
healthy
honorable
man
of
his
age
and
that
it
would
have
included
at
least
one
woman
however
when
even
the
present
was
an
almost
complete
puzzle
his
past
had
been
so
lost
to
her
that
she
had
not
considered
it
until
now
you
must
overlook
my
unceremonious
speech
edward
dunsack
proceeded
in
creditable
chinese
it
was
clumsy
but
i
was
deeply
affected
it
is
my
niece
you
see
who
was
hurt
and
who
has
a
very
sad
history
then
there
are
some
special
circumstances
i
have
to
explain
a
great
deal
before
you
could
understand
why
she
sent
for
your
husband
and
why
he
left
so
hurriedly
there
is
nothing
you
need
tell
me
taou
yuen
replied
in
her
slow
careful
english
manchu
eyes
can
see
as
well
as
american
a
thousand
times
better
he
too
returned
to
his
native
speech
it
is
delightful
to
talk
to
a
truly
civilized
being
all
that
would
have
to
be
shouted
at
the
women
of
salem
is
unnecessary
now
you
see
you
understand
the
heart
of
a
man
i
understand
you
she
said
impersonally
i
wonder
if
you
do
he
speculated
you
ought
to
see
what
how
much
i
think
of
you
my
brain
holds
nothing
else
he
declared
in
a
low
intense
voice
drawing
nearer
to
her
she
had
a
momentary
purely
feminine
shrinking
from
his
emaciated
shaking
frame
the
burning
eyes
in
a
face
dead
like
a
citron
then
her
placidity
returned
the
assurance
that
it
was
all
ordained
that
his
gestures
the
pumping
of
his
diseased
heart
had
no
more
individual
significance
than
the
movements
of
a
mechanical
figure
operated
by
strings
here
the
strings
of
supreme
fate
she
even
smiled
slightly
a
smile
not
the
mark
of
approval
or
humor
but
an
expression
of
absolute
composure
it
drove
him
at
once
into
febrile
excitement
at
least
i
understand
you
he
cried
far
more
than
you
suppose
you
ca
impress
me
with
your
air
of
a
gautama
i
know
the
freedom
of
your
country
it
does
shock
you
to
realize
that
your
husband
has
gone
to
see
a
woman
he
loved
perhaps
loves
still
and
you
are
not
disturbed
at
my
speaking
like
this
here
she
knew
regarding
him
no
more
than
a
shrilling
locust
was
the
center
about
which
for
a
moment
blindly
her
thoughts
of
gerrit
and
herself
had
revolved
his
past
a
woman
he
loved
but
it
did
in
the
least
upset
her
present
peace
of
mind
her
confidence
in
gerrit
there
was
a
sharp
distinction
between
the
eternal
the
divine
tao
that
which
is
and
must
prevail
and
the
personal
tao
subject
to
rebellion
and
all
the
evil
of
yin
and
she
felt
that
her
husband
tao
was
good
out
of
this
she
remarked
negligently
after
all
you
are
more
ignorant
of
china
than
i
thought
but
of
course
you
saw
only
the
common
and
low
side
you
have
not
heard
of
the
books
girls
are
taught
from
sacred
edict
and
of
the
heart
you
do
know
even
the
first
rule
of
book
of
rites
your
face
and
attitude
be
grave
and
thoughtful
and
the
second
your
steps
be
deliberate
and
regular
she
paused
conveying
by
her
manner
that
he
was
already
vanishing
and
that
she
was
relieved
that
would
do
well
enough
if
you
were
a
scholar
or
a
bonze
he
retorted
but
such
innocence
in
a
fashionable
woman
is
a
pretense
if
you
are
so
pure
how
can
you
explain
your
gold
and
bracelets
and
pins
all
the
marks
of
your
worldly
rank
taught
and
high
but
proud
brings
about
its
own
misfortune
he
was
so
close
to
her
now
that
she
caught
a
faint
sickly
reek
from
his
body
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
see
his
identity
his
reason
vanish
replaced
by
madness
in
his
staring
eyes
i
worship
you
he
murmured
opium
she
spoke
disdainfully
your
own
tobacco
is
drugged
he
asserted
but
that
not
important
i
tell
you
i
worship
you
the
most
beautiful
person
in
the
world
these
fools
in
salem
even
your
husband
ca
realize
of
your
perfection
they
ca
venerate
you
as
i
do
and
now
that
ammidon
has
gone
back
to
the
first
we
are
free
too
you
are
a
liar
she
said
with
an
unexpected
colloquial
ease
a
darker
color
stained
his
dry
cheeks
you
saw
him
he
replied
did
he
get
pale
or
did
he
and
did
he
or
not
rush
from
the
room
like
a
man
in
a
fever
i
tell
you
it
no
use
pretending
with
me
say
what
you
please
i
know
how
delicate
your
senses
are
i
tell
you
this
too
written
in
our
progression
that
we
should
meet
here
yes
and
be
a
great
deal
to
each
other
it
was
written
in
the
beginning
and
we
had
been
drawing
together
through
a
million
cycles
before
gerrit
ammidon
stumbled
across
you
taou
yuen
was
surprised
by
a
sudden
conviction
that
a
part
of
this
at
least
was
so
no
living
thing
however
minute
escaped
from
the
weariness
of
movement
either
ending
in
final
and
blessed
suspension
or
condemned
to
struggle
on
and
on
through
countless
lives
of
tormenting
passion
all
had
this
dignity
of
hope
or
despair
all
she
encountered
were
humble
impressive
or
debased
in
the
working
of
the
mighty
law
she
had
been
guilty
as
this
american
had
pointed
out
of
dangerous
and
wrong
pride
and
she
accepted
her
lesson
willingly
there
was
however
an
annoying
conflict
between
edward
dunsack
the
example
the
impersonal
and
edward
dunsack
making
violent
profession
of
his
unspeakable
desire
for
her
even
the
word
seemed
to
soil
her
but
there
was
no
other
he
went
recklessly
on
trying
to
increase
his
advantage
we
made
to
be
together
if
we
are
it
is
because
of
some
great
wickedness
of
mine
if
we
are
then
perhaps
i
am
lost
but
it
is
allowed
to
resist
evil
at
least
as
far
as
staying
out
of
its
touch
is
resistance
nothing
can
keep
you
from
me
he
declared
another
short
step
and
his
knees
would
be
brushing
her
gown
a
stronger
wave
of
dislike
shrinking
anger
drowned
her
logical
and
higher
resignation
it
is
time
for
you
to
go
she
said
her
voice
still
even
never
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
feel
his
hot
quivering
touch
and
all
her
philosophy
dropping
from
her
she
rose
quickly
if
this
were
china
she
told
him
in
a
cold
fury
you
be
cut
up
with
knives
in
the
where
i
could
look
on
but
even
here
i
can
ring
for
a
servant
and
when
captain
ammidon
comes
back
he
know
what
to
say
to
you
she
could
see
that
the
last
affected
him
he
hesitated
drew
back
his
hanging
fingers
clasping
and
unclasping
that
she
thought
relieved
would
dispose
of
him
then
it
was
clear
that
his
insanity
persisted
even
in
the
face
of
the
considerable
threat
of
gerrit
hot
pride
and
violent
tempers
it
our
destiny
he
repeated
firmly
in
his
borrowed
faith
at
once
a
little
terrifying
and
a
little
ridiculous
in
the
alien
mold
his
lips
twitched
and
his
bony
forehead
glistened
in
a
fine
sweat
now
thoroughly
roused
she
laughed
at
him
in
open
contempt
diseased
she
cried
take
your
sores
away
dog
licked
by
dogs
bowl
of
filth
she
was
speaking
in
chinese
in
words
of
one
syllable
like
the
biting
of
a
hair
whip
edward
dunsack
gasped
as
if
actual
blows
cut
him
he
stood
with
one
hand
half
raised
appalled
at
the
sudden
vicious
rush
of
her
anger
a
leaden
pallor
took
the
place
of
his
normal
sallow
coloring
and
it
was
evident
that
he
had
difficulty
in
withstanding
the
pressure
of
his
laboring
heart
he
stood
between
her
and
the
door
and
she
had
a
premonition
that
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
to
avoid
him
or
escape
she
could
however
call
and
some
one
there
were
a
score
of
people
about
the
house
must
certainly
appear
at
that
moment
she
saw
a
deep
change
sweep
over
his
countenance
taking
place
in
his
every
fiber
there
was
an
inner
wrenching
of
edward
dunsack
being
a
blurring
and
infusion
of
blood
in
his
eyes
a
breath
longer
and
more
agonized
than
any
before
and
she
was
looking
closely
into
the
face
of
an
overwhelming
hatred
for
a
moment
she
realized
he
had
even
considered
killing
her
with
his
flickering
hands
then
that
impulse
subsided
before
a
sidelong
expression
of
cunning
with
all
your
manchu
attitudes
he
mocked
her
yes
your
aristocratic
pretense
of
mourning
and
marks
of
rank
you
are
no
different
from
the
little
pleasure
girls
your
vocabulary
and
mind
are
the
same
i
was
a
fool
for
a
while
i
saw
nothing
but
your
satins
and
painted
face
i
forgot
you
were
yellow
i
had
forgotten
that
all
china
yellow
yellow
yellow
yellow
and
never
can
be
white
i
shut
my
eyes
to
it
and
it
dragged
me
down
into
its
slime
his
voice
was
hysterical
with
an
agony
of
rending
spiritual
torment
and
hopeless
grief
it
poisoned
me
little
by
little
with
the
smell
of
its
rivers
and
the
cursed
smell
of
its
pleasures
then
the
opium
a
year
after
i
had
lost
my
position
everything
and
when
i
came
over
here
it
followed
me
in
my
own
blood
even
then
i
might
have
broken
away
i
almost
had
when
gerrit
ammidon
brought
you
to
salem
you
came
at
a
time
when
i
was
fighting
hardest
to
throw
it
all
off
you
see
you
fascinated
me
you
were
all
that
was
most
alluring
of
china
and
i
wanted
you
so
badly
it
all
came
back
so
that
i
went
to
the
opium
to
find
you
progression
she
said
ironically
perhaps
he
muttered
who
knows
i
finished
for
this
life
anyhow
you
did
that
i
ca
even
keep
the
books
for
my
father
penny
trade
his
hands
crept
rigidly
toward
her
if
they
touched
her
she
would
be
degraded
for
ever
yet
she
was
incapable
of
flight
her
throat
refused
the
cry
which
she
had
been
debating
alternate
waves
of
revulsion
and
stoical
resignation
passed
over
her
with
chills
of
acute
terror
yet
she
managed
to
preserve
an
unstirred
exterior
and
that
she
observed
began
to
influence
him
his
loathing
was
as
great
as
ever
but
his
vision
that
had
been
fixed
in
a
blaze
of
fury
broke
avoided
her
direct
scrutiny
her
appearance
of
unconcern
there
was
a
sound
of
quick
light
feet
in
the
hall
the
bright
voice
of
one
of
gerrit
nieces
edward
dunsack
fell
into
a
profound
abstraction
he
turned
and
walked
away
from
her
standing
with
his
back
to
the
room
at
a
window
that
opened
upon
the
broad
green
park
he
was
so
weak
that
he
was
forced
to
support
himself
with
a
hand
on
the
wall
taou
yuen
was
motionless
for
a
perceptible
space
and
then
moved
toward
the
door
in
a
dignified
composure
all
this
had
come
from
the
utter
impropriety
of
the
life
in
america
dunsack
glanced
at
her
as
she
withdrew
and
for
a
moment
she
saw
his
fine
profile
sharp
and
dark
against
the
window
his
lips
stirred
but
she
heard
no
sound
then
she
was
on
the
stair
mounting
to
her
room
there
mechanically
she
filled
her
pipe
but
doing
this
she
noticed
that
her
hands
were
trembling
how
lamentably
she
had
failed
in
the
preservation
the
assertion
of
her
superiority
not
as
a
manchu
but
in
the
deeper
the
only
true
sense
of
the
word
in
submission
requite
hatred
with
virtue
she
spoke
admonition
aloud
and
in
the
customary
devious
channel
of
her
mental
processes
her
thoughts
returned
to
her
early
life
her
girlhood
so
marred
by
sickness
that
the
emperor
had
surrendered
his
customary
proprietary
right
in
the
daughters
of
manchu
nobles
surrounding
the
fact
of
her
early
suffering
which
had
kept
her
out
of
the
active
gayety
of
brothers
and
sisters
she
remembered
in
the
clearest
detail
her
father
house
in
the
north
the
later
residences
in
canton
and
shanghai
even
the
delightful
river
gardens
of
the
summer
place
at
soochow
were
less
vivid
inside
the
massive
tiled
stone
wall
the
rooms
there
were
a
hundred
at
least
faced
in
squares
on
the
inner
courtyard
and
were
connected
by
glass
enclosed
verandas
the
reception
houses
of
the
front
court
the
deeply
carved
wooden
platform
with
its
scarlet
covering
were
of
the
greatest
elegance
they
were
always
astir
with
the
numerous
secretaries
the
chinese
writers
and
messengers
the
and
chair
coolies
the
servants
and
blind
musicians
with
the
old
songs
millet
in
and
kuan
go
to
the
the
side
door
to
the
women
apartments
however
opened
into
a
retreat
where
her
father
concubine
he
had
but
one
trailed
like
a
bird
of
paradise
and
there
was
the
constant
musical
drip
of
a
fountain
in
an
old
granite
basin
there
during
the
years
when
she
was
lame
taou
yuen
mostly
stayed
she
had
been
dropped
from
a
palanquin
in
her
sixth
year
sharp
pains
soon
after
burned
in
her
hip
and
the
corresponding
leg
had
perceptibly
shortened
a
great
many
remedies
were
tried
in
vain
burning
with
charcoal
the
application
of
black
plasters
sweating
acupuncture
sticking
long
needles
into
the
afflicted
part
the
doctors
declared
that
the
five
elements
of
her
body
the
metal
wood
water
fire
and
earth
were
hopelessly
out
of
equilibrium
her
mother
had
then
called
necromancers
and
devil
charmers
lucky
and
unlucky
days
were
explored
strange
rites
were
conducted
before
her
terrified
eyes
screwed
into
the
determination
to
show
no
alarm
a
year
perhaps
after
they
had
become
resigned
to
her
injury
her
father
always
a
man
of
the
most
liberal
ideas
had
suddenly
brought
into
the
garden
to
see
her
an
english
doctor
passing
through
china
against
the
wailing
protests
of
the
women
the
englishman
had
been
given
authority
to
treat
her
and
he
had
caused
to
be
made
a
thin
steel
brace
clasping
taou
yuen
waist
and
extending
in
a
rigid
band
down
the
length
of
her
injured
leg
after
putting
a
high
shoe
on
her
other
foot
he
had
commanded
them
to
keep
the
brace
on
her
for
two
years
it
was
through
that
period
of
comparative
inactivity
that
she
acquired
a
habit
of
reading
and
thought
a
certain
grasp
of
philosophical
attitude
common
to
the
higher
masculine
chinese
mind
but
rare
among
their
women
she
had
for
instance
later
read
laotze
and
been
impressed
by
his
tranquil
elevation
above
the
petty
ills
and
concerns
of
life
and
the
flesh
her
father
like
all
the
ruling
class
regarded
taoism
which
had
indeed
degenerated
into
a
mass
of
nonsense
about
the
transmutation
of
base
metals
into
gold
and
the
elixir
of
life
with
contempt
but
this
seemed
to
her
no
depreciation
of
the
greatly
eminent
one
or
his
philosophy
of
the
two
taoes
the
household
or
at
least
the
family
worshipped
in
the
form
of
confucius
his
precepts
and
admonitions
the
sacred
or
filial
submission
the
tablets
and
ancestral
piety
were
a
part
of
her
blood
as
was
the
infinitely
fainter
infusion
of
buddhism
yet
in
her
intellectual
brooding
it
was
to
the
that
she
returned
she
paused
to
recall
that
the
brace
at
last
removed
she
was
practically
completely
recovered
but
the
bent
the
bracing
given
her
mind
had
remained
the
colorful
pageant
of
her
first
marriage
the
smaller
but
splendidly
appointed
house
of
her
husband
he
was
extremely
intelligent
and
had
honorably
passed
the
examination
for
licentiate
one
of
only
two
hundred
successful
bachelors
out
of
twenty
thousand
and
the
period
following
his
accidental
drowning
wheeled
quickly
through
her
brain
only
gerrit
ammidon
was
left
she
loved
him
taou
yuen
realized
for
a
quality
entirely
independent
of
race
he
had
more
than
anyone
else
she
knew
the
virtues
of
simplicity
and
purity
announced
by
as
the
marks
of
the
true
man
we
must
become
like
little
children
the
old
master
had
written
she
had
seen
this
at
once
in
the
amazing
interview
sanctioned
by
her
most
women
of
her
class
even
widows
would
have
perished
with
shame
at
being
exposed
to
a
foreigner
but
lu
kikwang
had
expressed
her
difference
from
them
in
the
terms
of
his
proposal
his
words
had
been
finely
better
although
the
truth
was
that
her
curiosity
had
always
mastered
the
other
and
more
prudent
instincts
yet
that
alone
would
not
have
prostrated
her
before
gerrit
ammidon
death
was
not
unthinkable
nor
carried
her
into
his
strange
terrifying
ship
and
stranger
life
the
love
had
been
born
almost
simultaneously
with
her
first
recognition
of
his
character
now
her
passion
for
him
was
close
and
jealous
a
constant
shifting
between
such
humanity
and
the
calm
detachment
which
prefigured
heaven
was
what
most
convinced
her
of
the
truths
of
all
this
took
body
at
the
announcement
of
edward
dunsack
about
gerrit
and
his
niece
certainly
he
might
have
had
an
affair
that
she
dismissed
but
the
insinuated
permanence
of
this
other
affection
was
serious
she
would
not
have
believed
dunsack
for
an
instant
but
as
he
had
pointed
out
gerrit
had
undoubtedly
been
upset
he
had
turned
pale
and
hurried
away
impolitely
it
was
by
such
apparently
slight
indications
that
the
great
inner
currents
of
life
were
discovered
the
fact
that
chinese
officials
had
more
than
one
wife
or
to
speak
correctly
concubines
in
addition
had
no
bearing
with
gerrit
such
was
not
the
custom
with
american
men
it
represented
for
him
yes
dishonor
she
laboriously
recalled
his
every
attitude
since
they
had
landed
in
america
and
was
obliged
to
admit
that
he
had
changed
he
was
less
gay
and
though
his
manner
was
always
considerate
she
recognized
a
growing
impatience
beneath
his
darker
calm
her
philosophy
was
again
torn
in
shreds
by
sharp
feminine
emotions
she
was
filled
with
jealousy
and
hatred
and
hurt
pride
the
clearest
expression
of
his
possible
discontent
had
marked
his
face
when
he
had
suddenly
come
into
their
room
and
saw
her
rising
from
a
prayer
for
his
father
gerrit
lips
had
been
compressed
almost
disdainful
at
that
moment
she
knew
unerringly
he
found
her
ugly
of
course
it
had
been
the
hideous
garments
of
mourning
she
must
wear
the
unhemmed
sackcloth
and
dull
slippers
bind
her
headdress
and
cover
her
pins
with
paste
for
a
hundred
days
and
then
a
second
mourning
of
black
or
dark
blue
and
no
flowers
for
three
years
it
might
well
be
that
by
then
gerrit
blind
to
these
proprieties
would
find
her
unendurable
suddenly
in
the
tremendous
difficulty
of
holding
him
against
an
entire
world
his
own
and
of
which
she
was
supremely
ignorant
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
needed
every
possible
means
every
coral
blossom
and
gold
filament
and
finger
of
paint
the
cunning
intoxication
of
subtle
dress
and
color
and
perfume
with
a
leaden
sense
of
guilt
but
in
a
fever
of
impatience
of
haste
she
stripped
off
the
coarse
hemp
for
her
most
elaborate
satins
her
santal
and
clover
and
carmine
when
gerrit
came
in
it
had
grown
dark
with
night
and
he
explained
that
he
had
been
busy
inspecting
the
spars
she
lighted
a
lamp
then
another
all
she
could
find
and
studied
him
unobtrusively
she
was
shocked
at
the
worn
expression
of
his
face
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
aged
in
the
few
hours
since
he
had
left
the
library
he
was
uneasy
silent
and
secretly
dismayed
she
saw
that
he
was
indifferent
to
her
changed
appearance
too
taou
yuen
debated
the
wisdom
of
telling
him
about
the
painful
scene
with
edward
dunsack
against
her
original
intent
she
decided
in
the
negative
she
informed
herself
that
the
reason
for
this
was
a
wish
to
preserve
him
now
that
they
were
practically
at
the
day
of
departure
from
an
unpleasant
duty
but
there
was
an
underlying
dimly
apprehended
and
far
different
motive
she
was
afraid
that
it
would
blow
into
flame
a
situation
that
might
otherwise
be
avoided
bring
to
life
a
past
naturally
dying
or
dead
she
saw
that
he
was
scarcely
aware
of
her
presence
in
the
room
perhaps
in
his
life
a
period
of
resentment
followed
you
are
dull
she
declared
and
i
am
going
down
to
the
garden
for
entertainment
gerrit
nodded
he
would
he
told
her
be
along
shortly
below
she
found
roger
brevard
with
the
oldest
ammidon
girl
and
her
mother
roger
brevard
she
had
discovered
was
in
love
with
sidsall
the
latter
it
developed
was
to
leave
shortly
for
a
party
brevard
was
not
going
and
when
gerrit
walked
across
the
grass
with
her
daughter
the
man
dropped
into
an
easy
conversation
with
taou
yuen
she
had
a
feeling
which
she
had
tried
in
vain
to
lose
of
the
vulgarity
the
impropriety
of
this
yet
she
recognized
that
there
was
none
of
the
former
in
roger
brevard
he
resembled
quite
a
little
her
dead
husband
and
for
that
reason
she
was
more
at
ease
with
him
in
spite
of
such
unaccustomed
familiarity
than
with
anyone
else
in
salem
but
gerrit
he
was
she
admitted
condescendingly
almost
as
cultivated
as
the
ordinary
chinese
gentleman
many
of
his
thoughts
where
she
could
understand
their
expression
might
have
come
from
a
study
of
the
sacred
kings
at
the
same
time
her
feminine
perception
realized
that
he
had
a
genuine
liking
for
her
you
be
delighted
to
leave
salem
he
said
leaning
forward
and
studying
her
that
would
not
be
polite
she
answered
formally
you
have
been
so
good
but
it
will
give
me
pleasure
to
see
shanghai
again
anyone
is
happier
with
customs
he
understands
and
prefers
he
added
indeed
i
choose
some
of
your
manners
rather
than
ours
you
see
you
have
been
at
the
business
of
civilization
so
much
longer
than
the
rest
of
us
our
history
begins
two
thousand
years
before
your
christ
she
told
him
our
language
has
been
spoken
without
change
for
centuries
as
you
call
them
but
such
facts
are
nothing
i
would
rather
hear
your
non
nonsense
she
stumbled
over
the
word
do
you
mean
that
what
we
call
nonsense
is
really
the
most
important
perhaps
she
replied
devotion
to
the
old
and
dead
is
greatly
necessary
yet
you
smile
at
it
i
did
mean
that
but
moons
and
lovers
and
music
he
cried
in
protest
we
terribly
serious
about
those
i
hear
nothing
but
talk
about
cargoes
and
sales
and
money
we
keep
the
other
under
our
hats
he
instructed
her
she
was
completely
mystified
and
he
explained
in
china
she
remarked
tentatively
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
love
two
women
at
once
maybe
one
a
little
more
than
the
other
but
he
can
be
kind
and
just
and
affectionate
to
them
both
tell
me
is
is
that
possible
with
an
american
no
he
spoke
emphatically
we
can
love
in
the
way
you
mean
only
one
perhaps
only
once
i
would
swear
to
that
but
there
are
simply
no
exceptions
to
the
first
men
are
unfaithful
yes
but
at
a
cost
to
themselves
or
because
they
are
incapable
of
restraint
to
be
unfaithful
in
anything
is
to
fail
is
it
you
can
lie
to
yourself
as
effectively
as
to
anybody
else
she
fixed
a
painful
attention
upon
him
but
lost
at
least
a
half
of
his
meaning
however
one
fact
was
clearer
than
ever
that
edward
dunsack
had
said
an
evil
thing
about
her
husband
it
seems
he
went
on
that
even
spiritual
concerns
can
be
the
result
of
long
custom
if
he
was
trying
to
find
an
excuse
for
chinese
habit
she
immediately
disposed
of
it
no
she
said
you
are
upside
down
the
spirit
is
first
the
eternal
tao
everywhere
alike
but
the
personal
spirit
is
different
in
you
and
in
us
a
sudden
dejection
seized
her
now
the
difference
seemed
vaster
than
anything
she
had
in
common
with
gerrit
a
wave
of
oppressive
nostalgia
of
confusion
and
dread
submerged
her
in
a
faintly
thunderous
darkness
she
felt
everywhere
about
her
the
presence
of
evil
and
threatening
shades
the
approach
of
her
husband
his
heavy
settling
into
a
chair
did
nothing
to
lighten
her
apprehension
how
soon
do
we
go
she
asked
faintly
in
two
weeks
with
nothing
unexpected
he
responded
without
interest
or
pleasure
it
flashed
through
her
mind
that
he
was
depressed
at
leaving
salem
that
other
woman
his
present
indifference
was
very
far
from
the
manner
in
which
he
had
first
discussed
their
leaving
yet
even
that
she
recalled
in
the
light
of
her
present
sensitiveness
had
been
unnaturally
abrupt
and
clothed
in
a
great
many
words
she
told
herself
arbitrarily
that
edward
dunsack
had
lied
for
the
purpose
which
his
conduct
afterward
made
clear
but
her
very
feeling
was
proof
that
she
believed
he
had
spoken
the
truth
she
was
a
victim
of
an
uneasy
curiosity
to
see
she
made
a
violent
mental
effort
and
recaptured
the
name
nettie
vollar
of
course
the
latter
had
been
the
deliberate
cause
of
whatever
wickedness
had
threatened
at
the
return
of
gerrit
with
her
taou
yuen
she
had
however
no
doubt
of
the
extent
of
this
gerrit
was
upright
faithful
to
the
necessity
roger
brevard
had
explained
all
that
assaulted
her
happiness
was
on
an
incorporate
plane
or
anyhow
in
a
procession
of
consequences
extending
far
back
and
forward
of
their
present
lives
but
she
recognized
she
had
no
excuse
nor
opportunity
to
see
nettie
vollar
ammidon
when
she
heard
of
the
accident
had
at
once
declared
her
intention
of
going
to
the
dunsacks
house
still
that
promised
no
chance
of
satisfying
her
own
desire
the
least
politeness
in
the
world
prohibited
her
from
going
baldly
in
and
demanding
to
see
the
woman
she
could
all
at
once
make
convincing
a
sympathy
or
impersonal
interest
entirely
contradictory
to
her
insistent
indifference
the
best
she
could
hope
was
for
them
to
sail
away
as
quickly
as
possible
when
on
the
other
side
of
the
seas
gerrit
would
probably
return
to
the
simplicity
of
being
she
had
adored
then
a
trivial
and
yet
serious
fear
occurred
to
her
perhaps
here
among
all
these
women
he
no
longer
held
her
beautiful
the
word
was
his
own
or
it
had
been
his
he
had
not
repeated
it
she
realized
twice
since
they
had
been
in
salem
personally
she
found
the
american
women
entirely
undistinguished
and
dressed
in
grotesquely
ugly
and
cheap
clothes
not
unlike
paper
lanterns
bobbing
along
the
ground
their
faces
were
shamelessly
bare
of
paint
and
their
manners
would
have
disgraced
the
lowest
servant
in
a
chinese
courtyard
this
was
natural
from
any
consideration
of
the
hideous
or
inappropriate
things
that
surrounded
them
and
from
the
complete
lack
of
what
she
could
distinguish
as
either
discipline
or
reverence
yet
gerrit
a
part
of
this
would
be
unable
to
share
her
attitude
she
had
heard
him
praise
the
appearance
of
women
so
insipid
that
she
had
turned
expecting
vainly
an
ironic
smile
roger
brevard
rose
and
made
his
bow
the
only
satisfactory
approach
to
a
courteous
gesture
she
had
met
outside
gerrit
occasional
effort
since
leaving
shanghai
he
stirred
muttered
a
perfunctory
phrase
and
sank
back
into
obscurity
little
quirks
of
unfamiliar
disturbing
feeling
ran
through
taou
yuen
her
mind
it
seemed
had
become
a
thing
of
no
importance
all
that
at
one
time
had
so
largely
ordered
her
life
was
superseded
by
these
illogical
emotions
spreading
apparently
from
her
heart
the
truth
was
she
told
herself
that
with
all
her
reading
and
philosophy
she
had
had
little
or
no
experience
of
actuality
the
injury
to
her
hip
and
quiet
life
in
the
gray
garden
at
canton
her
protected
existence
in
the
women
apartments
whatever
she
might
have
learned
from
them
neglected
because
of
the
general
silliness
of
their
chatter
the
formal
early
marriage
had
all
combined
for
the
preservation
of
her
ignorance
she
regarded
herself
now
with
distrust
nothing
could
have
been
more
unpleasant
than
the
failure
of
her
will
this
swamping
of
her
equanimity
she
never
lost
for
a
moment
the
image
of
superiority
that
should
be
her
perfect
example
the
that
was
the
way
of
heaven
but
her
comprehension
was
like
a
figure
ruthlessly
dragged
about
by
an
overpowering
unreflective
force
a
sharp
hatred
of
nettie
vollar
seared
her
mind
and
perished
in
a
miserable
sense
of
weakness
against
the
dark
charged
with
a
confusion
of
the
ten
thousand
things
she
stared
wearily
and
wakeful
she
reminded
herself
again
that
gerrit
would
soon
be
gone
from
salem
alone
with
her
on
the
long
voyage
to
china
but
he
return
to
america
come
back
to
salem
and
she
knew
that
he
would
never
bring
her
westward
again
a
period
of
depression
followed
which
seemed
to
have
no
immediate
connection
with
gerrit
she
had
an
indefinable
feeling
of
struggling
in
vain
against
adversity
of
opposition
to
an
implacable
power
for
a
short
while
after
she
rose
in
the
morning
it
appeared
that
she
had
regained
her
her
reason
and
a
consequent
happy
relief
irradiated
her
but
when
gerrit
came
up
after
she
had
finished
her
toilet
and
she
saw
from
his
haggard
face
that
he
too
must
have
been
awake
tormented
through
the
night
a
passion
of
bitterness
enveloped
her
at
which
all
that
had
gone
before
turned
pale
she
could
scarcely
restrain
herself
from
a
noisy
wailing
accusation
and
stood
regarding
him
with
a
tense
unnatural
grimace
the
result
of
her
effort
to
preserve
propriety
she
told
herself
at
the
tempest
of
vulgar
phrases
storming
through
her
consciousness
that
what
edward
dunsack
had
said
about
her
being
no
better
than
the
tea
house
girls
was
true
and
she
was
aghast
at
the
inner
treachery
capable
of
such
not
a
quivering
word
however
escaped
she
managed
a
commonplace
phrase
and
turned
aside
in
a
trivial
pretext
of
occupation
i
am
going
into
boston
with
captain
dunsack
on
business
connected
with
his
schooners
the
girl
grandfather
very
well
she
spoke
placidly
and
with
a
tempestuous
heart
watched
him
stride
quickly
about
the
park
she
settled
herself
in
a
long
motionless
contemplation
fastening
her
mind
upon
the
most
elevated
and
revered
ideas
conceivable
she
saw
the
eternal
tao
flowing
like
a
great
green
river
of
souls
smooth
and
mighty
and
resistless
and
she
willed
that
she
too
might
become
a
part
of
that
desirable
safe
in
surrender
men
striving
to
create
a
tao
for
personal
ends
beat
out
their
lives
in
vain
it
was
the
figure
of
the
river
developing
like
floating
on
a
deliberate
tide
or
struggling
impotently
against
it
later
a
message
came
up
from
ammidon
she
hoped
that
taou
yuen
would
drive
with
her
that
afternoon
she
dressed
with
the
most
particular
care
in
blue
and
dark
greens
her
shoulders
thick
with
embroidered
garlands
and
silver
her
piled
hair
ornamented
in
glittering
silver
leaves
and
garnets
she
went
down
when
she
heard
the
horses
on
the
street
below
but
the
barouche
was
empty
except
for
the
coachman
ammidon
left
a
half
hour
ago
a
servant
told
her
and
sent
the
carriage
back
for
you
they
moved
forward
going
she
saw
into
a
part
of
the
town
where
they
seldom
drove
the
narrow
crowded
way
by
the
wharves
and
turning
shortly
into
a
street
that
ended
abruptly
at
the
water
drew
up
before
a
dingy
house
on
her
right
the
door
was
open
and
they
waited
confident
that
ammidon
would
hear
the
clatter
of
hoofs
and
come
out
but
a
far
different
appeared
she
gazed
for
a
silent
space
at
taou
yuen
seated
above
her
as
if
confused
by
the
glittering
magnificence
it
was
probable
that
gerrit
brother
wife
had
come
there
on
an
errand
of
charity
for
the
woman
was
poor
dingy
like
the
house
with
a
face
drawn
by
suffering
and
material
struggle
of
course
you
captain
ammidon
wife
she
said
and
you
are
here
after
william
ammidon
well
she
gone
but
she
left
a
message
for
you
she
will
be
at
henry
whipple
the
bookseller
after
she
saw
nettie
she
went
right
off
to
send
her
some
things
would
wait
for
the
carriage
a
determined
body
taou
yuen
leaned
out
to
command
the
coachman
to
drive
on
but
the
other
plainly
bent
on
making
the
most
of
a
rare
opportunity
for
such
a
conversation
continued
talking
in
her
low
resigned
way
i
was
glad
to
have
her
too
nettie
gets
pretty
fretful
up
there
with
nobody
but
me
really
she
has
been
so
well
either
since
here
she
stopped
abruptly
recommenced
i
like
to
see
a
person
myself
of
ammidon
kind
i
been
alone
all
day
father
gone
to
boston
and
edward
away
i
do
know
where
taou
yuen
curiosity
to
see
nettie
vollar
returned
infinitely
multiplied
here
miraculously
was
an
opportunity
for
her
to
study
the
woman
who
was
beyond
any
doubt
an
important
part
of
gerrit
past
present
it
might
be
his
future
the
men
were
gone
she
got
resolutely
down
from
the
barouche
take
me
up
to
your
daughter
she
directed
quietly
why
that
very
kind
but
i
do
know
yes
certainly
mind
these
stairs
with
your
satin
skirt
i
do
always
get
around
to
the
whole
house
taou
yuen
saw
at
once
that
nettie
vollar
was
far
sicker
than
she
had
realized
her
head
lay
on
the
pillow
absolutely
spent
her
brow
damply
plastered
with
hair
and
her
eyes
enlarged
and
dull
taou
yuen
drew
a
chair
forward
and
sat
beside
a
table
with
a
glass
bowl
of
small
dark
pills
which
from
a
just
perceptible
odor
she
recognized
as
opium
she
looked
intently
coldly
at
the
prostrate
figure
a
flush
like
match
flames
burned
in
nettie
vollar
cheeks
and
she
said
in
a
voice
at
once
weak
and
sharp
you
her
taou
yuen
nodded
slowly
disdainfully
oh
how
could
he
the
other
exclaimed
in
what
sounded
like
the
thin
echo
of
a
passionate
cry
i
knew
you
were
chinese
but
i
never
realized
it
till
this
minute
as
gerrit
ammidon
wife
had
feared
she
was
totally
unable
to
judge
a
single
quality
or
feature
of
the
girl
before
her
she
looked
exactly
like
all
the
others
she
had
seen
in
salem
in
order
to
realize
her
she
needed
gerrit
eyes
gerrit
birth
then
one
fact
crept
insidiously
into
her
consciousness
here
in
a
way
was
another
being
who
had
gerrit
childlike
simplicity
that
was
the
most
terrifying
discovery
she
could
have
made
taou
yuen
felt
the
return
of
the
hateful
irresistible
emotions
which
had
destroyed
her
she
wanted
to
hurt
nettie
vollar
in
every
possible
way
to
mock
her
with
the
fact
that
she
had
lost
gerrit
perhaps
never
to
see
him
again
she
wanted
to
tell
her
that
she
taou
yuen
entirely
understood
her
hopes
efforts
and
that
they
were
vain
an
utter
possessed
her
at
the
same
time
a
feeling
of
imminent
danger
as
if
she
were
walking
with
willfully
shut
eyes
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
above
a
black
fatal
void
not
a
trace
of
this
appeared
on
her
schooled
countenance
and
once
more
she
completely
restrained
any
defiling
speech
she
deliberately
shifted
her
point
of
view
to
another
possible
aspect
of
all
that
confronted
her
it
might
be
that
this
woman
was
a
specter
a
bent
on
gerrit
destruction
such
a
thing
often
happened
how
much
better
if
nettie
vollar
had
been
killed
she
studied
her
with
a
renewed
interest
a
fresh
question
perhaps
the
other
would
die
as
it
was
she
was
extremely
weak
her
spirit
taou
yuen
saw
lay
listlessly
in
a
listless
body
nettie
vollar
slightly
moved
her
injured
arm
and
that
little
effort
exhausted
her
for
a
moment
her
eyes
closed
her
face
was
as
white
as
salt
a
further
almost
philosophical
consideration
engaged
taou
mind
this
extraordinary
occasion
her
being
with
the
other
alone
nettie
vollar
fragility
were
it
might
be
all
a
part
of
the
working
of
the
righteous
in
the
light
of
this
then
she
had
been
brought
here
for
a
purpose
the
ending
of
a
menace
to
her
husband
she
hesitated
for
a
breath
if
it
were
the
opposite
malignant
there
was
no
bottom
to
the
infamy
into
which
she
might
fall
it
was
a
tremendous
question
the
actual
execution
of
the
practical
suggestion
from
either
source
was
extremely
easy
she
had
but
to
lean
forward
draw
her
heavy
sleeve
across
the
strained
face
hold
it
there
for
a
little
and
nettie
vollar
would
have
died
of
of
any
one
of
a
number
of
reasonable
causes
she
taou
yuen
would
call
politely
distressed
for
the
mother
very
regrettable
gerrit
free
perhaps
she
had
no
shrinking
from
the
act
itself
nothing
that
might
have
been
called
pity
a
few
more
or
less
years
in
a
single
life
were
beneath
serious
consideration
it
was
the
lives
to
come
the
lingering
doubt
of
which
power
led
her
on
which
restrained
and
filled
her
mind
a
flicker
of
rage
darted
through
her
calm
questioning
her
mental
processes
again
faded
with
her
right
arm
across
the
supine
body
and
enveloping
the
face
in
her
left
sleeve
a
single
twist
and
nettie
vollar
would
choke
in
a
cloud
of
thick
satin
made
gay
with
unfading
flowers
and
the
embroidered
symbol
of
long
life
she
felt
her
body
grow
rigid
with
purpose
when
the
sound
of
a
footfall
below
held
her
motionless
in
an
unreasoning
dread
it
was
not
heavy
yet
she
was
certain
that
it
was
not
the
woman
a
blur
of
voices
drifted
up
to
her
the
dejected
feminine
tone
and
a
thin
querulous
demand
surprise
taou
yuen
turned
cold
as
stone
the
sensation
of
oppressive
danger
increased
until
it
seemed
as
if
she
and
not
nettie
vollar
were
strangling
there
was
a
profound
stillness
then
a
shuffling
tread
on
the
stair
and
edward
dunsack
entered
entered
but
stood
without
advancing
his
back
against
a
closed
door
even
since
yesterday
he
had
noticeably
wasted
there
were
muscles
of
his
face
that
twitched
continuously
his
hands
it
seemed
to
her
writhed
like
worms
he
said
nothing
but
stared
at
her
with
a
fixed
glittering
vision
all
his
one
time
worship
it
had
been
so
much
was
devoured
in
the
hatred
born
in
the
ammidon
library
frozen
with
apprehension
she
sat
without
movement
her
face
she
felt
as
still
as
a
lacquered
mask
to
her
astonishment
she
had
forgotten
nettie
vollar
existence
a
shaken
voice
from
the
bed
demanded
uncle
edward
what
come
over
you
do
you
see
ammidon
oh
her
speech
rose
in
a
choked
exclamation
edward
dunsack
had
turned
the
key
and
was
crossing
the
room
with
a
dark
twisted
face
his
eyes
stark
and
demented
taou
yuen
swung
round
toward
the
advancing
figure
heard
a
long
fluttering
breath
behind
her
perhaps
nettie
vollar
had
died
of
fright
the
terror
in
her
own
brain
dried
up
before
an
overwhelming
realization
she
had
betrayed
herself
to
the
principle
of
evil
she
was
lost
her
thoughts
were
at
once
incredibly
rapid
and
entirely
vivid
logical
edward
dunsack
ruined
in
china
herself
blinded
confused
destroyed
in
america
yesterday
she
had
held
him
powerless
with
the
mere
potency
of
her
righteousness
but
now
she
had
no
strength
there
was
a
loathsome
murmur
from
his
dusty
lips
he
intended
to
kill
her
to
mar
and
spoil
her
throat
a
degradation
forbidden
by
confucius
an
eternal
disfigurement
this
filled
her
with
a
renewed
energy
of
horror
here
there
was
none
but
a
feeble
woman
to
hear
her
if
she
called
she
rose
mechanically
a
hand
on
the
table
taou
yuen
saw
nettie
vollar
deathly
pallid
face
rolled
awkwardly
from
the
pillow
and
the
bowl
of
opium
there
were
twenty
or
more
pills
without
hesitation
even
with
a
sense
of
relief
she
swept
the
contents
of
the
bowl
into
her
palm
the
effort
of
swallowing
so
many
hard
particles
was
almost
convulsive
and
followed
with
a
nauseous
spasm
exhausted
by
mental
effort
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
a
dullness
like
smoke
settled
over
her
the
figure
of
edward
dunsack
retreated
to
an
infinite
distance
the
smoke
moved
in
a
great
steady
volume
the
eternal
and
changeless
tao
without
labor
or
desires
without
hatred
requited
with
virtue
attracting
all
honor
mounting
higher
and
higher
from
the
consuming
passions
the
seething
black
lives
of
her
immeasurable
fall
x
although
the
late
afternoon
was
at
an
hour
when
derby
street
should
have
been
filled
by
a
throng
in
the
slackening
of
the
waterside
employments
roger
brevard
found
it
noticeably
empty
in
this
he
suddenly
recognized
that
the
street
was
like
the
countingroom
of
the
mongolian
marine
insurance
company
the
heart
of
salem
greatness
they
were
weaker
stilled
in
a
decline
that
yet
was
not
evident
in
the
impressive
body
of
the
town
when
he
had
first
taken
charge
of
this
branch
both
salem
and
it
had
been
of
sufficient
moment
to
attract
him
from
new
york
the
company
was
insuring
boston
and
new
york
vessels
the
captains
had
thronged
its
broad
window
commanding
peters
and
essex
streets
now
only
an
occasional
shipmaster
holding
the
old
traditions
and
habits
or
else
retired
sat
in
the
comfortable
armchairs
with
leather
cushions
drawn
up
at
the
coal
hearth
or
expansive
in
white
through
the
summer
his
mind
shifted
to
a
consideration
of
these
facts
in
relation
to
himself
whether
the
same
thing
overtaking
the
place
and
marine
insurance
had
not
settled
upon
him
too
as
he
made
his
way
from
central
wharf
where
he
had
vainly
gone
for
prospective
business
his
inquiry
was
reaching
a
depressing
certainty
when
passing
and
gazing
down
hardy
street
he
saw
the
ammidon
barouche
standing
in
front
of
the
dunsacks
roger
brevard
stopped
the
ammidon
men
he
knew
seldom
drove
about
salem
he
had
heard
of
nettie
vollar
accident
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
rhoda
was
within
if
this
were
so
her
visit
limited
to
a
charitable
impulse
would
be
short
and
thinking
of
the
pleasure
of
driving
with
her
he
turned
into
the
side
way
as
he
approached
the
coachman
met
him
with
an
evident
impatience
no
sir
he
replied
to
brevard
inquiry
but
we
were
to
get
ammidon
at
the
bookstore
captain
gerrit
called
here
for
her
but
she
went
inside
unexpected
all
of
an
hour
ago
i
do
like
to
ask
for
the
lady
but
what
may
be
said
later
i
ca
think
he
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
when
a
woman
whom
brevard
recognized
as
kate
vollar
appeared
at
the
door
oh
mr
brevard
she
exclaimed
with
an
unnaturally
pallid
and
apprehensive
face
i
glad
to
find
you
please
come
upstairs
with
me
why
i
do
know
but
i
all
in
a
tremble
ammidon
went
to
see
nettie
then
edward
came
in
and
when
he
heard
who
was
there
he
acted
as
if
he
were
struck
dumb
and
went
up
like
a
person
afflicted
i
waited
the
longest
while
and
then
followed
them
and
knocked
why
the
door
was
shut
i
never
tell
you
but
they
did
answer
any
of
them
she
declared
with
clasped
straining
hands
three
in
the
room
and
not
a
sound
please
her
voice
was
suddenly
suffocated
by
dread
certainly
quarles
he
addressed
the
coachman
i
get
you
to
come
along
if
there
is
a
lock
to
break
it
will
need
a
heavier
shoulder
than
mine
mounting
the
narrow
somber
stair
followed
by
the
man
and
kate
vollar
he
wondered
vainly
what
might
have
happened
obscurely
some
of
the
fear
was
communicated
to
him
brevard
knocked
abruptly
on
the
door
indicated
but
there
was
no
answering
voice
or
movement
he
tried
the
latch
as
nettie
mother
had
found
it
was
fastened
quarles
roger
brevard
said
curtly
the
coachman
stepped
forward
braced
himself
for
the
shove
he
directed
against
the
wooden
barrier
and
the
door
swept
splintering
inward
roger
advanced
first
and
a
grim
confusion
touched
him
with
cold
horror
taou
yuen
was
half
seated
and
half
lying
across
a
table
beside
the
bed
he
could
see
her
face
but
her
body
was
utterly
lax
nettie
vollar
too
was
in
a
dreadful
waxen
similitude
of
death
with
lead
colored
lips
and
fixed
sightless
eyes
a
slight
extraordinary
sound
rose
behind
him
and
whirling
brevard
discovered
that
it
was
edward
dunsack
giggling
he
was
silent
immediately
under
the
other
scrutiny
and
an
expression
of
stubborn
and
malicious
caution
pinched
his
wasted
sardonic
countenance
brevard
turned
to
the
greater
necessity
of
the
women
and
moved
taou
yuen
so
that
he
could
see
her
features
it
was
evident
that
she
was
not
as
he
had
first
thought
dead
her
breathing
was
slow
and
deep
and
harsh
her
pulse
deliberate
and
full
she
was
warm
too
but
her
face
was
suffused
by
an
unnatural
blueness
and
the
pupils
of
her
inert
eyes
were
barely
discernible
he
shook
her
with
an
unceremonious
vigor
but
there
was
no
answering
energy
she
fell
across
his
arm
in
a
sheer
weight
of
body
he
moved
back
in
a
momentary
uncontrollable
repulsion
when
kate
vollar
threw
herself
past
him
onto
the
bed
nettie
she
cried
nettie
nettie
brevard
was
chilled
by
the
possibility
of
an
unutterable
tragedy
when
with
a
faint
suffusion
of
color
the
girl
gave
a
gasping
sigh
her
voice
stirred
in
a
terror
shaken
whisper
uncle
edward
do
why
do
oh
she
pressed
her
face
with
a
long
shudder
into
the
pillow
whatever
was
it
her
mother
began
wildly
brevard
caught
her
shoulder
not
now
he
directed
you
come
downstairs
with
me
we
must
have
help
at
once
and
your
daughter
quiet
however
he
was
in
a
quandary
he
could
trust
the
woman
here
he
would
have
to
go
immediately
for
assistance
and
yet
it
was
impossible
to
leave
nettie
vollar
and
gerrit
wife
alone
you
will
have
to
wait
in
the
room
he
decided
turning
to
quarles
edward
dunsack
was
wavering
against
a
wall
brevard
went
swiftly
up
to
him
we
need
you
he
said
shortly
dunsack
maintained
his
silence
and
air
of
stubborn
cunning
but
when
the
other
man
clasped
his
incredibly
thin
arm
he
went
willingly
followed
by
kate
vollar
below
there
he
sat
obediently
his
judicious
detachment
broken
by
a
repetition
of
the
thin
shocking
snigger
you
must
be
responsible
for
your
brother
roger
brevard
told
the
quivering
woman
i
be
back
immediately
now
that
you
know
safe
you
must
control
yourself
no
one
should
go
up
keep
everybody
out
till
you
hear
from
me
or
the
doctor
or
captain
ammidon
what
an
inexplicable
accident
or
crime
he
thought
hurriedly
approaching
the
countinghouse
of
ammidon
ammidon
and
saltonstone
the
first
and
nearest
of
the
places
to
which
he
must
go
he
could
remember
no
mark
of
what
had
overcome
taou
yuen
how
was
dunsack
who
was
now
clearly
demented
implicated
what
racking
thing
had
nettie
vollar
seen
in
the
subsequent
exclamatory
rush
even
on
the
following
morning
when
roger
brevard
learned
that
poisoned
by
opium
undoubtedly
taken
by
herself
gerrit
ammidon
wife
had
died
without
regaining
consciousness
the
greater
part
of
the
tragedy
became
little
clearer
no
statement
could
be
had
from
edward
dunsack
other
than
a
meaningless
array
of
precautionary
phrases
and
returning
in
a
sliding
gait
toward
hardy
street
he
was
put
under
a
temporary
restraint
nettie
vollar
brevard
heard
had
relapsed
from
her
injury
into
a
second
critical
collapse
yet
he
told
himself
entering
the
room
that
was
his
home
in
cane
large
square
house
on
chestnut
street
that
the
manchu
still
absorbed
his
speculations
it
was
a
pleasant
room
and
a
pleasant
house
with
a
dignified
portico
and
his
tall
windows
back
on
the
right
of
the
second
floor
opened
on
the
length
of
the
napiers
garden
brevard
sat
looking
out
over
a
dim
leafiness
of
evening
and
tried
to
discipline
his
thoughts
into
order
and
coherence
any
dignity
of
death
had
been
soiled
by
the
ugly
mystery
of
the
aspects
surrounding
the
end
of
taou
yuen
he
had
liked
her
extremely
well
agreeing
with
rhoda
ammidon
that
probably
they
had
never
been
permitted
to
know
a
more
aristocratic
breeding
or
greater
degrees
of
purely
worldly
and
mental
and
personal
charm
than
those
of
gerrit
wife
his
mind
grew
more
philosophical
and
a
perception
yet
without
base
in
facts
convinced
him
that
taou
yuen
had
been
killed
by
america
it
was
a
fantastic
thought
and
he
attempted
to
dismiss
it
waiting
for
more
secure
knowledge
but
it
persisted
she
had
been
killed
by
unfamiliar
circumstances
tradition
emotions
in
some
manner
but
how
he
was
unable
to
disentangle
from
the
pressures
of
mere
curiosity
and
conjecture
nettie
vollar
or
rather
gerrit
old
passing
affair
with
nettie
had
entered
into
the
unhappy
occurrence
after
an
hour
vain
search
he
gave
up
all
effort
to
pierce
the
darkness
until
he
had
actual
knowledge
if
he
ever
had
he
was
forced
to
add
silently
it
was
possible
that
the
secret
might
be
entirely
guarded
from
the
public
even
from
the
closer
part
he
had
played
and
his
familiarity
with
the
ammidon
family
he
was
an
inmate
of
their
inner
garden
with
its
lilac
trees
and
hedged
roses
in
season
the
pungent
beds
of
flowers
and
box
the
moonshade
of
the
poplars
roger
brevard
turned
from
the
consideration
of
taou
yuen
to
the
even
more
insistent
claim
of
his
increasing
affection
for
sidsall
he
stopped
again
both
to
lament
and
delight
in
her
youth
another
year
and
he
would
have
unhesitatingly
announced
his
feeling
as
love
to
them
all
it
was
that
he
admitted
to
himself
almost
shyly
the
obvious
thing
was
for
him
to
wait
through
the
year
or
more
until
the
ammidons
would
hear
of
a
proposal
and
then
urge
his
desire
he
could
see
her
quite
often
meanwhile
yes
that
was
the
sensible
course
even
in
the
face
of
his
own
multiplying
years
they
were
more
than
sidsall
yet
he
added
in
he
was
not
definitely
snared
in
middle
age
he
was
still
elastic
in
body
and
youthful
but
for
graying
hair
in
appearance
his
birth
was
eligible
from
every
social
consideration
and
though
he
was
not
rich
he
had
enough
independently
to
assure
the
safety
of
his
wife
future
this
did
not
come
entirely
or
now
even
in
the
larger
part
from
the
mongolian
marine
insurance
company
but
took
the
form
of
a
comparatively
small
but
secure
private
income
he
paused
to
wonder
if
it
had
not
been
that
latter
fact
which
had
prevented
his
being
successful
successful
that
was
in
william
ammidon
meaning
of
the
word
he
had
not
made
money
nor
a
position
of
importance
among
men
of
affairs
such
safety
he
decided
was
a
dangerous
possession
judged
by
the
standards
he
was
now
considering
a
few
thousand
a
year
for
life
struck
at
the
root
of
activity
it
induced
a
critical
detached
attitude
toward
life
overemphasized
the
importance
of
the
cut
of
a
trouser
and
the
validity
of
pedigree
it
was
a
mistake
to
dance
noticeably
well
drifting
together
with
almost
everyone
else
he
had
reached
his
present
position
past
forty
by
imperceptible
degrees
obscurely
influenced
by
the
play
of
what
he
intrinsically
was
on
circumstances
or
accident
or
fate
although
he
had
never
done
so
before
he
compared
himself
with
gerrit
ammidon
the
other
refusal
to
accept
a
partnership
in
the
family
firm
or
command
a
california
clipper
was
known
gerrit
and
himself
were
alike
in
that
they
apprehended
the
values
of
life
more
clearly
than
did
the
ordinary
mind
or
heart
but
in
retaliation
the
world
they
differed
from
curtly
brushed
them
aside
roger
brevard
could
not
see
that
they
had
made
the
least
mark
on
the
callous
normal
cruelty
or
the
aesthetic
and
spiritual
blindness
of
the
existence
they
shared
but
it
was
always
possible
that
something
bigger
than
their
grasp
of
justice
or
beauty
was
afoot
he
turned
from
the
darkened
prospect
of
the
window
and
his
thoughts
to
the
room
without
a
light
he
removed
his
formal
street
clothes
hanging
the
coat
and
waistcoat
folding
the
trousers
in
a
drawer
with
exact
care
changing
his
light
boots
for
fiber
slippers
he
set
the
former
in
the
row
of
footgear
drawn
up
like
a
military
review
against
the
wall
though
it
was
quite
obscure
now
and
no
one
would
see
him
he
paused
to
brush
his
slightly
disarranged
hair
before
tying
the
cord
of
his
chamber
robe
he
resumed
his
seat
the
year
he
reverted
to
sidsall
would
pass
but
try
as
he
might
he
had
no
feeling
of
security
in
the
future
however
near
it
was
the
present
this
sidsall
that
filled
him
with
a
tyrannical
and
bitter
longing
she
was
unbelievably
beautiful
now
against
the
faintness
of
his
hope
his
patience
he
saw
the
whole
slow
process
of
the
disintegration
of
marine
insurance
and
with
it
his
own
fatuous
insensibility
to
the
decline
that
decline
with
its
exact
counterpart
in
himself
salem
and
he
were
getting
dusty
together
he
straightened
up
vigorously
in
his
chair
this
would
never
do
he
must
wind
up
his
affairs
here
and
return
to
new
york
the
tranquil
backwater
had
overpowered
him
for
a
time
but
again
awake
he
would
strike
out
strongly
with
sidsall
endless
doubt
and
hope
fluctuated
within
him
voices
rose
from
the
napier
garden
and
from
a
tree
sounded
the
whirring
of
the
first
locust
he
had
noticed
that
summer
on
a
noon
following
he
saw
the
passage
of
the
three
or
four
carriages
that
constituted
the
funeral
cortège
of
taou
yuen
entirely
private
interment
she
would
be
buried
of
course
by
christian
service
here
were
none
of
the
elaborate
confucian
rites
and
ceremonial
yet
from
what
taou
yuen
had
occasionally
indicated
confucius
the
buddha
were
all
more
alike
than
different
they
all
vainly
preached
humility
purity
the
subjugation
of
the
flesh
he
stopped
later
in
the
charter
street
cemetery
and
found
her
grave
the
headstone
marked
taou
yuen
a
manchurian
lady
the
wife
of
gerrit
ammidon
esq
and
the
dates
he
saw
naturally
but
little
of
the
ammidons
a
glimpse
of
rhoda
in
the
carriage
and
william
on
charter
street
the
ready
for
sea
continued
in
her
berth
at
phillips
wharf
fragments
of
news
came
to
him
quoted
and
grotesquely
exaggerated
and
even
malicious
reports
of
the
tragedy
at
the
dunsacks
standing
at
his
high
desk
in
the
countingroom
of
the
mongolian
marine
insurance
company
taou
glittering
passage
through
salem
already
seemed
to
him
a
fable
a
dream
even
sidsall
robustly
near
by
had
an
aspect
of
unreality
in
the
tender
fabric
of
his
visions
captain
rendell
his
spade
beard
at
the
verge
of
filmed
old
eyes
who
was
seated
at
the
window
rose
with
difficulty
for
a
moment
he
swayed
on
insecure
legs
then
barely
gathering
the
necessary
power
moved
out
into
the
street
later
when
roger
brevard
was
turning
the
key
on
the
insurance
company
for
the
day
lacy
saltonstone
stopped
to
speak
in
her
charming
slow
manner
mother
of
course
is
in
a
whirl
with
captain
ammidon
about
to
marry
that
nettie
vollar
since
she
is
recovering
after
all
and
our
moving
to
boston
you
see
i
there
so
often
it
will
make
really
very
little
difference
to
me
sidsall
is
the
lucky
one
though
you
never
know
it
from
seeing
her
i
thought
you
have
heard
why
to
lausanne
a
tremendously
impressive
school
for
a
year
they
have
promised
her
london
afterward
i
would
call
that
a
promise
but
actually
sidsall
does
she
want
to
go
he
asked
mechanically
all
the
emotions
that
had
chimed
through
his
being
suddenly
clashing
in
a
discordant
misery
he
bowed
absently
and
hastening
to
his
room
softly
closed
the
door
and
sat
without
supper
late
into
the
evening
lost
in
a
bitterness
that
continually
poisoned
the
resolutions
formed
out
of
his
overwhelming
need
he
was
aghast
at
the
inner
violence
that
destroyed
the
long
tranquility
of
his
existence
the
clenched
hands
and
spoken
words
lost
in
the
shadows
over
the
napiers
garden
he
wanted
sidsall
with
a
breathless
tyranny
infinitely
sharper
than
any
pang
of
youth
she
was
life
itself
she
did
want
to
go
lacy
had
made
that
clear
and
he
told
himself
that
her
reluctance
could
only
must
proceed
from
one
cause
that
she
cared
for
him
as
he
dwelt
on
this
the
one
alleviating
possibility
he
became
certain
of
its
truth
he
would
find
her
at
once
and
in
spite
of
rhoda
and
william
ammidon
explain
that
his
whole
hope
lay
in
marrying
her
with
an
utter
contempt
at
all
the
small
orderly
habits
which
he
now
saw
were
the
expression
of
a
confirmed
dry
preciseness
he
left
his
clothes
in
a
disorderly
heap
such
a
feeling
as
sidsall
and
his
he
repeated
from
the
oppressive
expanse
of
his
black
walnut
bed
was
above
ordinary
precautions
and
observance
then
unable
to
dismiss
the
thought
of
how
crumpled
his
trousers
would
be
in
the
morning
oppressed
by
the
picture
of
the
tumbled
garments
he
finally
rose
and
in
the
dark
relaid
them
in
the
familiar
smooth
array
in
the
morning
his
disturbance
resolved
into
what
seemed
a
very
decided
and
reasonable
attitude
he
would
see
rhoda
that
day
and
explain
his
feeling
and
establish
what
rights
and
agreement
he
could
he
was
willing
to
admit
that
sidsall
was
perhaps
too
young
for
an
immediate
decision
so
wide
in
results
the
ache
the
hunger
for
happiness
sharpened
by
vague
premonitions
of
mischance
began
again
to
pound
in
his
heart
at
the
ammidons
it
was
clear
immediately
that
rhoda
manner
toward
him
had
changed
it
had
become
more
social
even
voluble
and
restrained
she
conversed
brightly
about
trivial
happenings
while
he
sat
listening
gravely
silent
but
it
was
evident
that
she
soon
became
aware
of
his
difference
and
her
voice
grew
sharper
almost
antagonistic
they
were
in
the
formal
parlor
a
significant
detail
in
itself
and
roger
brevard
saw
william
pass
the
door
well
he
would
soon
have
to
go
he
must
speak
about
sidsall
now
it
promised
to
be
unexpectedly
difficult
but
the
words
were
forming
when
she
came
into
the
room
there
were
faint
shadows
under
her
eyes
the
unmistakable
marks
of
tears
an
overwhelming
passion
for
her
choked
at
his
throat
she
came
directly
up
to
him
ignoring
her
mother
did
you
hear
that
they
want
me
to
go
away
she
asked
he
nodded
it
that
i
came
to
see
your
mother
about
they
know
i
do
want
to
she
continued
i
explained
it
to
them
very
carefully
my
dear
sidsall
rhoda
ammidon
cut
in
we
ca
have
this
what
roger
has
to
say
must
be
for
me
and
your
father
the
girl
smiled
at
her
and
turned
again
to
roger
brevard
do
you
want
me
to
go
no
he
cried
all
his
planning
lost
in
uncontrollable
rebellion
then
i
do
think
i
shall
william
entered
and
stood
at
his
wife
shoulder
you
wo
insist
sidsall
faced
them
quietly
ridiculous
her
father
replied
brevard
realized
that
he
must
support
the
girl
bravery
of
spirit
how
adorable
she
was
but
before
the
overwhelming
superior
position
of
the
elder
ammidons
their
weight
of
propriety
and
authority
his
determination
wavered
to
be
quite
frank
the
other
man
proceeded
since
it
has
been
forced
on
us
sidsall
imagines
herself
in
love
with
you
brevard
i
do
need
to
remind
you
how
unsuitable
and
preposterous
that
is
she
too
young
to
know
the
meaning
of
love
besides
my
dear
fellow
you
a
quarter
century
her
elder
we
want
sidsall
to
go
to
london
like
her
mother
have
her
cotillions
before
she
settles
into
marriage
they
ca
understand
roger
sidsall
touched
his
hand
we
sorry
to
disappoint
them
you
ought
to
be
made
to
leave
the
room
william
fumed
that
is
necessary
rhoda
told
him
i
am
sure
roger
understands
perfectly
how
impossible
it
is
you
must
be
hurt
she
turned
to
him
if
i
admit
that
we
have
very
different
plans
at
least
a
man
nearer
sidsall
age
the
girl
lifted
a
confident
face
to
him
you
want
to
marry
me
you
she
asked
more
than
any
other
conceivable
joy
but
he
said
this
silently
his
courage
slowly
ebbed
before
the
parental
displeasure
viewing
him
coldly
then
sidsall
paused
expectantly
a
touch
of
impatience
even
invaded
her
manner
please
tell
them
roger
why
i
have
to
put
up
with
this
is
beyond
me
william
ammidon
expostulated
with
his
wife
it
shameless
roger
brevard
winced
he
tried
to
say
something
about
hope
and
the
future
but
it
was
so
weak
a
palpable
retreat
leaving
sidsall
alone
and
unsupported
that
the
words
perished
unfinished
the
girl
studied
him
suddenly
startled
and
her
confidence
ebbed
he
turned
away
crushed
by
convention
filled
with
shame
and
a
sense
of
a
stillness
followed
of
unendurable
length
in
which
he
found
his
attention
resting
on
the
diversified
shapes
of
the
east
india
money
in
a
corner
cabinet
it
was
sidsall
who
finally
spoke
slowly
and
clearly
forgive
me
he
recognized
that
she
was
addressing
her
mother
and
father
from
a
whisper
of
skirts
he
realized
that
she
was
leaving
the
room
without
the
will
necessary
for
a
last
glimpse
he
stood
with
his
head
bowed
by
an
appalling
sensation
of
weariness
and
years
in
a
flash
of
roger
brevard
knew
that
he
would
never
as
he
had
hoped
leave
salem
he
was
an
abstemious
man
one
of
a
family
of
long
lives
and
he
would
linger
here
increasingly
unimportant
for
a
great
while
an
old
man
in
new
epochs
isolated
among
strange
people
and
prejudices
whatever
the
cause
the
small
safety
or
an
inward
flaw
he
had
never
been
part
of
the
corporate
sweating
humanity
where
in
the
war
of
spirit
and
flesh
the
vital
rewards
and
accomplishments
were
found
soon
after
he
passed
gerrit
and
nettie
vollar
driving
in
the
direction
of
the
harbor
she
was
lying
back
wanly
in
the
ammidon
barouche
but
her
companion
face
was
set
directly
ahead
his
expression
of
general
disdain
strongly
marked
a
vigorous
hand
roger
noted
was
clasped
about
nettie
supine
palm
she
saw
him
standing
on
the
sidewalk
and
bowed
slightly
but
the
shipmaster
plainly
overlooked
him
together
with
the
rest
of
salem
the
end
of
summer
was
imminent
in
a
whirl
of
yellow
leaves
and
chill
gray
wind
there
was
a
ringing
of
bugles
through
the
morning
the
strains
of
military
quicksteps
rhythmic
tramping
feet
and
the
irregular
fulmination
of
salutes
that
it
was
already
the
day
of
the
annual
fall
review
seemed
incredible
to
roger
brevard
he
was
indifferent
to
the
activities
of
the
common
but
when
he
heard
that
the
was
sailing
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
he
left
his
inconsequential
affairs
for
phillips
wharf
a
small
number
were
waiting
on
the
solid
reach
the
wharfinger
office
at
its
head
and
a
stone
warehouse
blocking
the
end
where
the
lay
with
her
bowsprit
pointing
outward
the
harbor
was
slaty
cold
and
there
was
a
continuous
slapping
of
small
waves
on
the
shore
darkening
clouds
hung
low
in
the
west
out
of
which
the
wind
cut
in
flaws
across
the
open
the
town
so
lately
folded
in
lush
greenery
showed
a
dun
lift
of
roofs
and
stripping
branches
tossing
against
an
ashy
sky
close
beside
roger
stood
barzil
dunsack
his
beard
blowing
with
kate
vollar
in
a
bright
red
shawl
her
skirts
whipping
uneasily
against
her
father
legs
beyond
were
the
ammidons
william
and
rhoda
in
a
deep
furred
wrap
and
their
daughters
rhoda
waved
for
him
to
join
them
but
he
declined
with
a
gesture
of
acknowledgment
the
deck
of
the
was
above
his
vision
but
he
could
see
most
of
the
stir
of
departure
the
peremptory
voice
of
the
mate
rose
from
the
bow
minor
directions
were
issued
by
the
second
mate
aft
a
seaman
was
aloft
on
the
yard
and
another
stood
at
the
stage
rising
sharply
from
the
wharf
gerrit
and
his
wife
had
not
yet
arrived
and
the
pilot
making
a
leisurely
appearance
stopped
to
exchange
remarks
with
the
ammidons
he
climbed
on
board
the
ship
and
roger
could
see
his
head
and
shoulders
moving
toward
the
poop
and
mounting
the
ladder
the
wind
grew
higher
shriller
every
moment
it
was
thrashing
among
the
stays
and
braces
the
man
aloft
a
small
movement
against
the
clouds
swayed
in
its
force
there
was
a
faint
clatter
of
hoofs
from
derby
street
brevard
had
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
an
arriving
carriage
and
gerrit
supporting
nettie
ammidon
advanced
over
the
wharf
the
shipmaster
walked
slowly
the
woman
clinging
almost
dragging
at
his
erect
strength
they
went
close
by
roger
nettie
pale
face
her
large
shining
dark
eyes
were
filled
with
placid
surrender
her
companion
spoke
in
a
low
grave
tone
and
she
looked
up
at
him
in
a
tired
and
happy
acquiescence
the
two
families
joined
and
there
was
a
confused
determined
gayety
of
farewell
and
good
wishes
out
of
it
finally
emerged
the
captain
of
the
and
the
slight
figure
upon
his
arm
he
wore
a
beaver
hat
and
as
they
mounted
the
stage
he
was
forced
to
hold
it
on
with
his
free
hand
when
the
was
reached
they
disappeared
into
the
cabin
broadrick
the
pilot
called
you
can
get
in
those
bow
fasts
send
a
hawser
to
the
end
of
the
wharf
i
going
to
warp
out
there
was
a
harsh
answering
clatter
as
the
mooring
chain
that
held
the
bow
of
the
was
secured
and
a
group
of
sailors
went
smartly
forward
with
a
hemp
cable
to
the
end
of
the
wharf
seaward
thrust
the
lay
on
the
eastern
side
with
the
wind
beating
over
the
starboard
quarter
and
there
was
little
difficulty
in
getting
under
way
strain
was
kept
on
the
stern
and
breast
fasts
while
the
mate
directed
ship
your
capstan
bars
the
capstan
turned
and
the
moved
forward
to
the
beat
of
song
low
lands
low
lands
hurrah
my
john
i
thought
i
heard
the
old
man
say
low
lands
low
lands
hurrah
my
john
we
get
some
rum
hurrah
my
john
then
shake
her
vast
heaving
broadrick
shouted
the
intimate
spectators
on
phillips
wharf
moved
out
with
the
ship
gerrit
ammidon
was
now
visible
on
the
with
the
pilot
he
walked
to
the
port
railing
aft
and
stood
gazing
somberly
back
at
salem
the
stovepipe
hat
was
not
yet
discarded
and
the
hand
firmly
holding
its
brim
resembled
a
final
gesture
of
contempt
the
pilot
approached
him
there
was
a
brief
exchange
of
words
and
the
former
sharply
ordered
stand
by
to
run
up
your
jib
and
staysail
broadrick
put
two
good
men
at
the
sheets
and
see
that
those
sails
do
slat
to
pieces
on
the
wharf
there
take
that
stern
fast
out
to
the
last
ringbolt
second
mate
get
your
fenders
aboard
the
wind
increased
in
a
violence
tipped
with
stinging
rain
give
her
the
jib
and
she
heeled
slightly
and
gathered
steerage
way
roger
brevard
involuntarily
waved
a
parting
salutation
an
extraordinary
emotion
swept
over
him
a
ship
bound
to
the
east
always
stirred
his
imagination
and
sense
of
beauty
but
the
departure
of
the
had
a
special
significance
it
was
the
beginning
yes
and
the
end
of
almost
the
whole
sweep
of
human
suffering
and
despair
of
longing
and
hope
and
passion
and
a
reward
let
go
the
stern
fast
steady
your
helm
there
steady
sir
a
mere
gust
of
song
was
distinguishable
against
the
blast
of
storm
under
the
lee
of
the
stone
warehouse
on
the
solidity
of
the
wharf
the
land
roger
brevard
watched
the
while
one
by
one
the
topsails
were
sheeted
home
and
the
yards
mastheaded
a
gale
by
night
somebody
said
the
ship
driving
with
surprising
speed
toward
the
open
sea
was
now
apparently
no
more
than
a
fragile
shell
on
the
immensity
of
the
stark
horizon
the
light
faded
the
days
were
growing
shorter
alone
brevard
followed
the
others
moving
away
kate
vollar
red
shawl
suddenly
streamed
out
and
was
secured
by
a
wasted
hand
just
that
way
he
thought
the
color
and
vividness
of
his
existence
had
been
withdrawn
the
end
