james
arrives
i

a
week
from
today
i
shall
be
james
orlebar
cloyster
it
is
just
three
years
since
i
first
met
james
we
made
each
acquaintance
at
seven
on
the
morning
of
the
of
july
in
the
middle
of
fermain
bay
about
fifty
yards
from
the
shore
fermain
bay
is
in
guernsey
my
home
had
been
with
my
mother
for
many
years
at
martin
in
that
island
there
we
two
lived
our
uneventful
lives
until
fate
brought
one
whom
when
first
i
set
my
eyes
on
him
i
knew
i
loved
perhaps
it
is
indiscreet
of
me
to
write
that
down
but
what
does
it
matter
it
is
for
no
one
reading
but
my
own
james
my
is
peeping
slyly
over
my
shoulder
as
i
write
on
the
contrary
my
door
is
locked
and
james
is
i
believe
in
the
of
his
hotel
at
peter
port
at
that
time
it
had
become
my
habit
to
begin
my
day
by
rising
before
breakfast
and
taking
a
swim
in
fermain
bay
which
lies
across
the
road
in
front
of
our
cottage
the
practice
i
have
since
abandoned
it
was
good
for
the
complexion
and
generally
healthy
i
had
kept
it
up
moreover
because
i
had
somehow
cherished
an
unreasonable
but
persistent
presentiment
that
some
day
somebody
james
as
it
turned
out
would
cross
the
pathway
of
my
maiden
existence
i
told
myself
that
i
must
be
ready
for
him
it
would
never
do
for
him
to
arrive
and
find
no
one
to
meet
him
on
the
of
july
i
started
off
as
usual
i
wore
a
short
tweed
skirt
brown
stockings
my
ankles
were
and
are
good
a
calico
blouse
and
a
red
ponto
barked
at
my
heels
in
one
hand
i
carried
my
blue
twill
in
the
other
a
miniature
alpenstock
the
sun
had
risen
sufficiently
to
scatter
the
slight
mist
of
the
summer
morning
and
a
few
flecked
clouds
were
edged
with
a
slender
frame
of
red
gold
leisurely
and
with
my
presentiment
strong
upon
me
i
descended
the
steep
cliffside
to
the
cave
on
the
left
of
the
bay
where
guarded
by
the
faithful
ponto
i
was
accustomed
to
disrobe
and
soon
afterwards
i
came
out
my
dark
hair
over
my
shoulders
and
blue
twill
over
a
portion
of
the
rest
of
me
to
climb
out
to
the
point
of
the
projecting
rocks
so
that
i
might
dive
gracefully
and
safely
into
the
still
blue
water
i
was
a
good
swimmer
i
reached
the
ridge
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bay
without
fatigue
not
changing
from
a
powerful
i
then
sat
for
a
while
at
the
water
edge
to
rest
and
to
drink
in
the
thrilling
glory
of
what
my
heart
persisted
in
telling
me
was
the
morning
of
my
life
and
then
i
saw
him
not
distinctly
for
he
was
rowing
a
dinghy
in
my
direction
and
consequently
had
his
back
to
me
in
the
stress
of
my
emotions
and
an
aggravation
of
modesty
i
dived
again
with
an
intensity
like
that
of
a
captured
conger
i
yearned
to
be
hidden
by
the
water
i
could
watch
him
as
i
swam
for
strictly
speaking
he
was
in
my
way
though
a
little
farther
out
to
sea
than
i
intended
to
go
as
i
drew
near
i
noticed
that
he
wore
an
odd
garment
like
a
he
had
stopped
rowing
i
turned
upon
my
back
for
a
moment
rest
and
as
i
did
so
heard
a
cry
i
resumed
my
former
attitude
and
brushed
the
salt
water
from
my
eyes
the
dinghy
was
wobbling
unsteadily
the
was
in
the
bows
and
he
my
was
in
the
water
only
for
a
second
i
saw
him
then
he
sank
how
i
blessed
the
muscular
development
of
my
arms
i
reached
him
as
he
came
to
the
surface
that
twice
he
remarked
contemplatively
as
i
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
be
brave
i
said
excitedly
i
can
save
you
i
should
be
most
awfully
obliged
he
said
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
i
say
he
remonstrated
you
not
going
to
drag
me
along
by
the
roots
of
my
hair
are
you
the
natural
timidity
of
man
is
i
find
attractive
i
helped
him
to
the
boat
and
he
climbed
in
i
trod
water
clinging
with
one
hand
to
the
stern
allow
me
he
said
bending
down
no
thank
you
i
replied
not
really
thank
you
very
much
but
i
think
i
will
stay
where
i
am
but
you
may
get
cramp
by
the
way
i
really
frightfully
obliged
to
you
for
saving
my
life
i
mean
a
perfect
stranger
i
afraid
quite
spoiled
your
dip
not
at
all
i
said
politely
did
you
get
cramp
a
twinge
it
was
awfully
kind
of
you
not
at
all
then
there
was
a
rather
awkward
silence
is
this
your
first
visit
to
guernsey
i
asked
yes
i
arrived
yesterday
it
a
delightful
place
do
you
live
here
yes
that
white
cottage
you
can
just
see
through
the
trees
i
suppose
i
could
give
you
a
tow
anywhere
no
thank
you
very
much
i
will
swim
back
another
constrained
silence
are
you
ever
in
london
miss
goodwin
oh
yes
we
generally
go
over
in
the
winter
cloyster
really
how
jolly
do
you
go
to
the
theatre
much
oh
yes
we
saw
nearly
everything
last
time
we
were
over
there
was
a
third
silence
i
saw
a
remark
about
the
weather
trembling
on
his
lip
and
as
i
was
beginning
to
feel
the
chill
of
the
water
a
little
i
determined
to
put
a
temporary
end
to
the
conversation
i
think
i
will
be
swimming
back
now
i
said
you
quite
sure
i
ca
give
you
a
tow
quite
thanks
perhaps
you
would
care
to
come
to
breakfast
with
us
cloyster
i
know
my
mother
would
be
glad
to
see
you
it
is
very
kind
of
you
i
should
be
delighted
shall
we
meet
on
the
beach
i
swam
off
to
my
cave
to
dress
breakfast
was
a
success
for
my
mother
was
a
philosopher
she
said
very
little
but
what
she
did
say
was
magnificent
in
her
youth
she
had
moved
in
literary
circles
and
now
found
her
daily
pleasure
in
the
works
of
schopenhauer
kant
and
other
germans
her
lightest
reading
was
and
occasionally
she
would
drop
into
ibsen
and
maeterlinck
the
asparagus
of
her
philosophic
banquet
her
chosen
mode
of
thought
far
from
leaving
her
inhuman
or
intolerant
gave
her
a
social
distinction
which
i
had
inherited
from
her
i
could
if
i
had
wished
it
have
attended
with
success
the
the
and
the
dances
to
which
i
was
frequently
invited
but
i
always
refused
nature
was
my
hostess
nature
which
provided
me
with
balmy
zephyrs
that
were
more
comforting
than
buttered
toast
which
set
the
race
of
the
waves
to
the
ridges
of
fermain
where
arose
no
shrill
heated
voice
crying
love
forty
which
decked
foliage
in
more
splendid
sheen
than
anything
the
local
costumier
could
achieve
and
whose
poplars
swayed
more
rhythmically
than
the
dancers
of
the
assembly
rooms
the
constraint
which
had
been
upon
us
during
our
former
conversation
vanished
at
breakfast
we
were
both
hungry
and
we
had
a
common
topic
we
related
our
story
of
the
sea
in
alternate
sentences
we
ate
and
we
talked
turn
and
turn
about
my
mother
listened
to
her
the
affair
compared
with
the
tremendous
subjects
to
which
she
was
accustomed
to
direct
her
mind
was
broad
farce
james
took
it
with
an
air
of
restrained
amusement
i
seriously
tentatively
i
diverged
from
this
subject
towards
other
and
wider
fields
impressions
of
guernsey
which
drew
from
him
his
address
at
the
peter
port
hotel
the
horrors
of
the
sea
passage
from
weymouth
which
extorted
a
comment
on
the
limitations
of
england
england
london
kensington
south
kensington
the
yes
yes
extraordinary
curious
coincidence
excursus
on
smallness
of
world
queer
old
gentleman
he
is
indeed
quite
one
of
the
old
school
oh
quite
still
wears
that
beaver
hat
does
he
really
yes
ha
ha
yes
here
the
humanising
influence
of
the
teutonic
school
of
philosophic
analysis
was
demonstrated
by
my
mother
action
cloyster
she
said
must
reconcile
himself
to
exchanging
his
comfortable
rooms
at
the
peter
port
i
particularly
dislike
hotel
life
goodwin
for
the
shelter
of
our
cottage
he
accepted
he
was
then
warned
that
i
was
chef
at
the
cottage
mother
gave
him
a
chance
to
change
his
mind
something
was
said
about
my
saving
life
and
destroying
digestion
he
went
to
collect
his
things
in
an
ecstasy
of
merriment
at
this
point
i
committed
an
indiscretion
which
can
only
be
excused
by
the
magnitude
of
the
occasion
my
mother
had
retired
to
her
favourite
where
by
a
de
on
the
part
of
the
carpenter
a
system
of
low
adjustable
bookcases
had
been
craftily
constructed
in
such
a
way
that
when
she
sat
in
her
they
jutted
in
a
semicircle
towards
her
hand
james
whom
i
had
escorted
down
the
garden
path
had
left
me
at
the
little
wooden
gate
and
had
gone
swinging
down
the
road
i
shielded
from
outside
observation
if
any
by
a
line
of
lilacs
gazed
rapturously
at
his
retreating
form
the
sun
was
high
in
the
sky
now
it
was
a
perfect
summer
day
birds
were
singing
their
notes
blended
with
the
gentle
murmur
of
the
sea
on
the
beach
below
every
fibre
of
my
body
was
thrilling
with
the
magic
of
the
morning
through
the
kindly
branches
of
the
lilac
i
watched
him
and
then
as
though
in
obedience
to
the
primaeval
call
of
that
july
sunshine
i
stood
on
tiptoe
and
blew
him
a
kiss
i
realised
in
an
instant
what
i
had
done
fool
that
i
had
been
the
i
was
rigid
with
discomfiture
my
mother
eyes
were
on
the
book
she
held
and
yet
a
faint
smile
seemed
to
hover
round
her
lips
i
walked
in
silence
to
where
she
sat
at
the
open
window
she
looked
up
her
smile
was
more
pronounced
margie
she
said
yes
mother
the
hedonism
of
voltaire
is
the
indictment
of
an
honest
bore
yes
mother
she
then
resumed
her
book
chapter
james
sets
out
miss
margaret
goodwin
narrative
continued
those
august
days
have
there
been
any
like
them
before
i
realise
with
difficulty
that
the
future
holds
in
store
for
me
others
as
golden
the
island
was
crammed
with
trippers
they
streamed
in
by
every
boat
but
james
and
i
were
infinitely
alone
i
loved
him
from
the
first
from
the
moment
when
he
had
rowed
out
of
the
unknown
into
my
life
clad
in
a
i
like
to
think
that
he
loved
me
from
that
moment
too
but
if
he
did
the
knowledge
that
he
did
came
to
him
only
after
a
certain
delay
it
was
my
privilege
to
watch
this
knowledge
steal
gradually
but
surely
upon
him
we
were
always
together
and
as
the
days
passed
by
he
spoke
freely
of
himself
and
his
affairs
obeying
unconsciously
the
rudder
of
my
tactful
inquisitiveness
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
i
knew
as
much
about
him
as
he
did
himself
it
seemed
that
a
guardian
an
impersonal
sort
of
business
man
with
a
small
but
impossible
family
was
the
most
commanding
figure
in
his
private
life
as
for
his
finances
sovereigns
the
remnant
of
a
larger
sum
which
had
paid
for
his
education
at
cambridge
stood
between
him
and
the
necessity
of
offering
for
hire
a
sketchy
acquaintance
with
general
literature
and
a
third
class
in
the
classical
tripos
he
had
come
to
guernsey
to
learn
by
personal
observation
what
chances
tomato
growing
held
out
to
a
young
man
in
a
hurry
to
get
rich
tomato
growing
i
echoed
dubiously
and
then
to
hide
a
sense
of
bathos
people
made
it
pay
of
course
they
work
very
hard
said
james
without
much
enthusiasm
but
i
fancy
i
added
the
life
is
not
at
all
unpleasant
at
this
point
embarrassment
seemed
to
engulf
james
he
blushed
swallowed
once
or
twice
in
a
somewhat
convulsive
manner
and
stammered
then
he
made
his
confession
guiltily
i
was
not
to
suppose
that
his
aims
ceased
with
the
attainment
of
a
the
nurture
of
a
wholesome
vegetable
occupied
neither
the
whole
of
his
ambitions
nor
even
the
greater
part
of
them
to
write
the
agony
with
which
he
throatily
confessed
it
to
be
swept
into
the
maelstrom
of
literary
journalism
to
be
with
the
unslumbering
forces
of
fleet
street
those
were
the
real
objectives
of
james
orlebar
cloyster
of
course
i
mean
he
said
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
bit
of
a
struggle
at
first
if
you
see
what
i
mean
what
i
mean
to
say
is
rejected
manuscripts
and
so
on
but
still
after
a
bit
once
get
a
footing
you
know
i
should
like
to
have
a
dash
at
it
i
mean
i
think
i
could
do
something
you
know
of
course
you
could
i
said
i
mean
lots
of
men
have
do
you
know
there
plenty
of
room
at
the
top
i
said
he
seemed
struck
with
this
remark
it
encouraged
him
he
had
had
his
opportunity
of
talking
thus
of
himself
during
our
long
rambles
out
of
doors
they
were
a
series
of
excursions
which
he
was
accustomed
to
describe
as
hunting
expeditions
for
the
stocking
of
our
larder
thus
james
would
announce
at
breakfast
that
prawns
were
the
quarry
and
the
foreshore
round
cobo
bay
the
and
to
cobo
accordingly
we
would
set
out
this
area
extends
along
the
coast
on
the
other
side
of
peter
port
where
two
halts
had
to
be
made
one
at
madame
garnier
the
confectioners
the
other
at
the
library
to
get
fiction
which
i
never
read
then
came
a
journey
on
the
top
of
the
antediluvian
a
sort
of
on
rails
and
then
a
whole
summer
afternoon
among
the
prawns
cobo
is
an
expanse
of
shingle
dotted
with
seaweed
and
rocks
and
guernsey
is
a
place
where
one
can
take
off
one
shoes
and
stockings
on
the
slightest
pretext
we
waded
hither
and
thither
with
the
warm
brine
lapping
unchecked
over
our
bare
legs
we
did
not
use
our
nets
very
industriously
it
is
true
but
our
tongues
were
seldom
still
the
slow
walk
home
was
a
thing
to
be
looked
forward
to
ah
those
memorable
homecomings
in
the
quiet
solemnity
of
that
hour
when
a
weary
sun
stoops
one
can
fancy
with
a
sigh
of
pleasure
to
sink
into
the
bosom
of
the
sea
was
agreeably
varied
by
and
sports
which
james
in
his
capacity
of
head
forester
included
in
his
venery
for
an
early
start
had
to
be
made
usually
between
six
and
seven
the
chase
took
us
inland
until
after
walking
through
the
fragrant
earthy
lanes
we
turned
aside
into
dewy
meadows
where
each
blade
of
grass
sparkled
with
a
gem
of
purest
water
again
the
necessity
of
going
barefoot
breakfast
was
late
on
these
mornings
my
mother
whiling
away
the
hours
of
waiting
with
a
volume
of
diogenes
laertius
in
the
she
would
generally
open
the
meal
with
the
remark
that
anaximander
held
the
primary
cause
of
all
things
to
be
the
infinite
or
that
it
was
a
favourite
expression
of
theophrastus
that
time
was
the
most
valuable
thing
a
man
could
spend
when
breakfast
was
announced
one
of
the
covers
concealed
the
mushrooms
which
under
my
superintendence
james
had
done
his
best
to
devil
a
quiet
day
followed
devoted
to
sedentary
recreation
after
the
labours
of
the
run
the
period
which
i
have
tried
to
sketch
above
may
be
called
the
period
of
whatever
else
love
does
for
a
woman
it
makes
her
an
actress
so
we
were
merely
excellent
friends
till
james
eyes
were
opened
when
that
happened
he
abruptly
discarded
i
on
the
other
hand
played
it
the
more
vigorously
the
situation
was
mine
our
day
run
became
the
merest
shadow
of
a
formality
the
office
of
head
forester
lapsed
into
an
absolute
sinecure
love
was
with
us
triumphant
and
no
longer
to
be
skirted
round
by
me
fresh
electric
glorious
in
james
we
talked
we
must
have
talked
we
moved
our
limbs
performed
their
ordinary
daily
movements
but
a
golden
haze
hangs
over
that
second
period
when
by
the
strongest
effort
of
will
i
can
let
my
mind
stand
by
those
perfect
moments
i
seem
to
hear
our
voices
low
and
measured
and
there
are
silences
fond
in
themselves
and
yet
more
fondly
interrupted
by
unspoken
messages
from
our
eyes
what
we
really
said
what
we
actually
did
where
precisely
we
two
went
i
do
not
know
we
were
together
and
the
blur
of
love
was
about
us
always
the
blur
it
is
not
that
memory
can
not
conjure
up
the
scene
again
it
is
not
that
the
scene
is
clouded
by
the
of
a
dream
no
it
is
because
the
dream
is
brought
to
me
by
will
and
not
by
sleep
the
blur
recurs
because
the
blur
was
there
a
love
vast
as
ours
is
penalised
as
it
were
by
this
blur
which
is
the
of
infinity
in
mighty
distances
whether
from
earth
to
heaven
whether
from
gerrard
to
glasgow
there
is
always
that
awful
that
disintegrating
blur
a
third
period
succeeded
i
may
call
it
the
affectionately
practical
period
instantly
the
blur
vanishes
we
were
at
our
proper
distance
from
the
essence
of
things
and
though
infinity
is
something
one
yearns
for
passionately
one
normal
condition
has
its
meed
of
comfort
i
remember
once
hearing
a
man
in
a
government
office
say
that
the
pleasantest
moment
of
his
annual
holiday
was
when
his
train
rolled
back
into
paddington
station
and
he
was
a
man
too
of
a
naturally
lazy
disposition
it
was
about
the
middle
of
this
third
period
during
a
ramble
that
the
idea
occurred
to
us
first
to
me
then
after
reflection
to
james
that
mother
ought
to
be
informed
how
matters
stood
between
us
we
went
into
the
house
and
interviewed
her
she
was
in
the
reading
a
translation
of
of
athenaeus
good
morning
she
said
looking
at
her
watch
it
is
a
little
past
our
usual
breakfast
time
margie
i
think
we
have
been
looking
for
mushrooms
mother
every
investigation
says
athenaeus
which
is
guided
by
principles
of
nature
fixes
its
ultimate
aim
entirely
on
gratifying
the
stomach
have
you
found
any
mushrooms
heaps
goodwin
said
james
mother
i
said
we
want
to
tell
you
something
the
fact
is
goodwin
we
are
engaged
my
mother
liked
james
margie
she
once
said
to
me
there
is
good
in
cloyster
he
is
not
for
ever
offering
to
pass
me
things
time
had
not
caused
her
to
modify
this
opinion
she
received
our
news
calmly
and
inquired
into
james
means
and
prospects
james
had
forty
pounds
and
some
odd
silver
i
had
nothing
the
of
my
mother
contribution
to
our
conference
was
wait
you
are
both
young
she
said
she
then
kissed
me
smiled
contemplatively
at
james
and
resumed
her
book
when
we
were
alone
my
darling
said
james
we
must
wait
tomorrow
i
catch
the
boat
for
weymouth
i
shall
go
straight
to
london
my
first
manuscript
shall
be
in
an
editor
hands
on
wednesday
morning
i
will
go
but
i
will
come
back
i
put
my
arms
round
his
neck
my
love
i
said
i
trust
you
go
always
remember
that
i
know
you
will
succeed
i
kissed
him
and
when
you
have
succeeded
come
back
chapter
a
harmless
deception
miss
margaret
goodwin
narrative
continued
they
say
that
everyone
is
capable
of
one
novel
and
in
my
opinion
most
people
could
write
one
play
whether
i
wrote
mine
in
an
inspiration
of
despair
i
can
not
say
i
wrote
it
three
years
had
passed
and
james
was
still
haggling
with
those
who
buy
men
brains
his
earnings
were
enough
just
to
keep
his
head
above
water
but
not
enough
to
make
us
two
one
perhaps
because
everything
is
clear
and
easy
for
us
now
i
am
gradually
losing
a
proper
appreciation
of
his
struggle
that
should
never
be
he
did
not
win
but
he
did
not
lose
which
means
nearly
as
much
for
it
is
almost
less
difficult
to
win
than
not
to
lose
so
my
mother
has
told
me
in
modern
journalistic
london
and
i
know
that
he
would
have
won
the
fact
that
he
continued
the
fight
as
he
did
was
in
itself
a
pledge
of
ultimate
victory
what
he
went
through
while
trying
with
his
pen
to
make
a
living
for
himself
and
me
i
learned
from
his
letters
london
he
wrote
is
not
paved
with
gold
but
in
literary
fields
there
are
nuggets
to
be
had
by
the
lightest
scratching
and
those
nuggets
are
plays
a
successful
play
gives
you
money
and
a
name
automatically
what
the
ordinary
writer
makes
in
a
year
the
successful
dramatist
receives
without
labour
in
a
fortnight
he
went
on
to
deplore
his
total
lack
of
dramatic
intuition
some
men
he
said
have
some
of
the
qualifications
while
falling
short
of
the
others
they
have
a
sense
of
situation
without
the
necessary
tricks
of
technique
or
they
sacrifice
plot
to
atmosphere
or
atmosphere
to
plot
i
worse
luck
have
not
one
single
qualification
the
nursing
of
a
climax
the
tremendous
omissions
in
the
dialogue
the
knack
of
stage
characterisation
all
these
things
are
in
some
inexplicable
way
outside
me
it
was
this
letter
that
set
me
thinking
ever
since
james
had
left
the
island
i
had
been
chafing
at
the
helplessness
of
my
position
while
he
toiled
in
london
what
was
i
doing
nothing
i
suppose
i
helped
him
in
a
way
the
thought
of
me
would
be
with
him
always
spurring
him
on
to
work
that
the
time
of
our
separation
might
be
less
but
it
was
not
enough
i
wanted
to
be
something
and
it
was
during
these
restless
weeks
that
i
wrote
my
play
i
think
nothing
will
ever
erase
from
my
mind
the
moment
when
the
central
idea
of
girl
who
came
to
me
it
was
a
boisterous
october
evening
the
wind
had
been
rising
all
day
now
the
branches
of
the
lilac
were
dancing
in
the
rush
of
the
storm
and
far
out
in
the
bay
one
could
see
the
white
crests
of
the
waves
gleaming
through
the
growing
darkness
we
had
just
finished
tea
the
lamp
was
lit
in
our
little
and
on
the
sofa
so
placed
that
the
light
fell
over
her
left
shoulder
in
the
manner
recommended
by
oculists
sat
my
mother
with
schopenhauer
of
ponto
slept
on
the
rug
something
in
the
unruffled
peace
of
the
scene
tore
at
my
nerves
i
have
seldom
felt
so
restless
it
may
have
been
the
storm
that
made
me
so
i
think
myself
that
it
was
james
letter
the
boat
had
been
late
that
morning
owing
to
the
weather
and
i
had
not
received
the
letter
till
after
lunch
i
listened
to
the
howl
of
the
wind
and
longed
to
be
out
in
it
my
mother
looked
at
me
over
her
book
you
are
restless
margie
she
said
there
is
a
volume
of
marcus
aurelius
on
the
table
beside
you
if
you
care
to
read
no
thank
you
mother
i
said
i
think
i
shall
go
for
a
walk
wrap
up
well
my
dear
she
replied
she
then
resumed
her
book
i
went
out
of
our
little
garden
and
stood
on
the
cliff
the
wind
flew
at
me
like
some
wild
thing
spray
stung
my
face
i
was
filled
with
a
wild
exhilaration
and
then
the
idea
came
to
me
the
simplest
most
dramatic
idea
quaint
whimsical
with
just
that
suggestion
of
pathos
blended
with
it
which
makes
the
fortunes
of
a
play
the
central
idea
to
be
brief
of
girl
who
of
my
maenad
tramp
along
the
with
my
brain
afire
and
my
return
draggled
and
dripping
an
hour
late
for
dinner
of
my
writing
and
of
my
tears
and
black
depression
of
the
pens
i
wore
out
and
the
quires
of
paper
i
spoiled
and
finally
of
the
ecstasy
of
the
day
when
the
piece
began
to
move
and
the
characters
to
live
i
need
not
speak
anyone
who
has
ever
written
will
know
the
sensations
james
must
have
gone
through
a
hundred
times
what
i
went
through
once
at
last
at
long
last
the
play
was
finished
for
two
days
i
gloated
alone
over
the
great
pile
of
manuscript
then
i
went
to
my
mother
my
diffidence
was
exquisite
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
tell
her
the
nature
of
my
request
when
i
spoke
to
her
after
lunch
at
last
she
understood
that
i
had
written
a
play
and
wished
to
read
it
to
her
she
took
me
to
the
with
gentle
solicitude
and
waited
for
me
to
proceed
at
first
she
encouraged
me
for
i
faltered
over
my
opening
words
but
as
i
warmed
to
my
work
and
as
my
embarrassment
left
me
she
no
longer
spoke
her
eyes
were
fixed
intently
upon
the
blue
space
beyond
the
lilac
i
read
on
and
on
till
at
length
my
voice
trailed
over
the
last
line
rose
gallantly
at
the
last
fence
the
single
word
and
abruptly
broke
the
strain
had
been
too
much
for
me
tenderly
my
mother
drew
me
to
the
sofa
and
quietly
with
closed
eyelids
i
lay
there
until
in
the
soft
cool
of
the
evening
i
asked
for
her
verdict
seeing
as
she
did
instantly
that
it
would
be
more
dangerous
to
deny
my
request
than
to
accede
to
it
she
spoke
that
there
is
an
absence
my
dear
margie
of
any
relationship
with
life
that
not
a
single
character
is
in
any
degree
human
that
passion
and
virtue
and
vice
and
real
feeling
are
wanting
this
surprises
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
i
had
expected
to
listen
to
a
natural
ordinary
unactable
episode
arranged
more
or
less
in
steichomuthics
there
is
no
work
so
scholarly
and
engaging
as
the
amateur
but
in
your
play
i
am
amazed
to
find
the
touch
of
the
professional
and
experienced
playwright
yes
my
dear
you
have
proved
that
you
happen
to
possess
the
quality
one
that
is
most
difficult
to
acquire
of
surrounding
a
situation
which
is
improbable
enough
to
be
convincing
with
that
absurdly
mechanical
conversation
which
the
public
demands
as
your
mother
i
am
disappointed
i
had
hoped
for
originality
as
your
literary
i
stifle
my
maternal
feelings
and
congratulate
you
unreservedly
i
thanked
my
mother
effusively
i
think
i
cried
a
little
she
said
affectionately
that
the
hour
had
been
one
of
great
interest
to
her
and
she
added
that
she
would
be
glad
to
be
consulted
with
regard
to
the
steps
i
contemplated
taking
in
my
literary
future
she
then
resumed
her
book
i
went
to
my
room
and
the
last
letter
i
had
had
from
james
barrel
club
covent
garden
my
darling
margie
i
am
writing
this
line
simply
and
solely
for
the
selfish
pleasure
i
gain
from
the
act
of
writing
to
you
i
know
everything
will
come
right
some
time
or
other
but
at
present
i
am
suffering
from
a
bad
attack
of
the
blues
i
am
like
a
general
who
has
planned
out
a
brilliant
attack
and
realises
that
he
must
fail
for
want
of
sufficient
troops
to
carry
a
position
on
the
taking
of
which
the
whole
success
of
the
assault
depends
briefly
my
position
is
like
this
my
name
is
pretty
well
known
in
a
small
sort
of
way
among
editors
and
the
like
as
that
of
a
man
who
can
turn
out
fairly
good
stuff
besides
this
i
have
many
influential
friends
you
see
where
this
brings
me
i
am
in
the
middle
of
my
attacking
movement
and
i
have
not
been
beaten
back
but
the
key
to
the
enemy
position
is
still
uncaptured
you
know
what
this
key
is
from
my
other
letters
it
the
stage
ah
margie
one
acting
play
only
one
it
would
mean
everything
apart
from
the
actual
triumph
and
the
direct
profits
it
would
bring
so
much
with
it
the
enemy
flank
would
be
turned
and
the
rest
of
the
battle
would
become
a
mere
rout
i
should
have
an
accepted
position
in
the
literary
world
which
would
convert
all
the
other
avenues
to
wealth
on
which
i
have
my
eye
instantly
into
royal
roads
obstacles
would
vanish
the
fact
that
i
was
a
successful
playwright
would
make
the
acceptance
of
the
sort
of
work
i
am
doing
now
inevitable
and
i
should
get
paid
ten
times
as
well
for
it
and
it
would
mean
well
you
know
what
it
would
mean
do
you
darling
margie
tell
me
again
that
i
have
your
love
that
the
waiting
is
not
too
hard
that
you
believe
in
me
dearest
it
will
come
right
in
the
end
nothing
can
prevent
that
love
and
the
will
of
a
man
have
always
beaten
time
and
fate
write
to
me
dear
your
devoted
how
utterly
free
from
thought
of
self
his
magnificent
loyalty
forgot
the
dreadful
tension
of
his
own
great
battle
and
pictured
only
the
tedium
of
waiting
which
it
was
my
part
to
endure
i
finished
my
letter
to
james
very
late
that
night
it
was
a
very
long
and
explanatory
letter
and
it
enclosed
my
play
the
main
point
i
aimed
at
was
not
to
damp
his
spirits
he
would
i
knew
well
see
that
the
play
was
suitable
for
staging
he
would
in
short
see
that
i
an
inexperienced
girl
had
done
what
he
a
trained
professional
writer
had
failed
to
do
lest
therefore
his
pique
should
kill
admiration
and
pleasure
when
he
received
my
work
i
wrote
as
one
begging
a
favour
here
i
said
we
have
the
means
to
achieve
all
we
want
do
not
oh
do
not
criticise
i
have
written
down
the
words
but
the
conception
is
yours
the
play
was
inspired
by
you
but
for
you
i
should
never
have
begun
it
take
my
play
james
take
it
as
your
own
for
yours
it
is
put
your
name
to
it
and
produce
it
if
you
love
me
under
your
own
signature
if
this
hurts
your
pride
i
will
word
my
request
differently
you
alone
are
able
to
manage
the
business
side
of
the
production
you
know
the
right
men
to
go
to
to
approach
them
on
behalf
of
a
stranger
work
is
far
less
likely
to
lead
to
success
i
have
assumed
you
will
see
that
the
play
is
certain
to
be
produced
but
that
will
only
be
so
if
you
adopt
it
as
your
own
claim
the
authorship
and
all
will
be
well
much
more
i
wrote
to
james
in
the
same
strain
and
my
reward
came
next
day
in
the
shape
of
a
telegram
accept
cloyster
of
the
play
and
its
reception
by
the
public
there
is
no
need
to
speak
the
criticisms
were
all
favourable
neither
the
praise
of
the
critics
nor
the
applause
of
the
public
aroused
any
trace
of
jealousy
in
james
their
unanimous
note
of
praise
has
been
a
source
of
pride
to
him
he
is
proud
ah
joy
that
i
am
to
be
his
wife
i
have
blotted
the
last
page
of
this
commonplace
of
mine
the
moon
has
come
out
from
behind
a
cloud
and
the
whole
bay
is
one
vast
sheet
of
silver
i
could
sit
here
at
my
bedroom
window
and
look
at
it
all
night
but
then
i
should
be
sure
to
oversleep
myself
and
be
late
for
breakfast
i
shall
read
what
i
have
written
once
more
and
then
i
shall
go

the
invasion
of
bohemia
it
is
curious
to
reflect
that
my
marriage
which
takes
place
today
week
destroys
once
and
for
all
my
life
ambition
i
have
never
won
through
to
the
goal
i
longed
for
and
now
i
never
shall
ever
since
i
can
remember
i
have
yearned
to
be
known
as
a
bohemian
that
was
my
ambition
i
have
ceased
to
struggle
now
married
bohemians
live
in
oakley
street
king
road
chelsea
we
are
to
rent
a
house
in
halkett
place
three
years
have
passed
since
the
excellent
but
unsteady
steamship
brought
me
from
guernsey
to
southampton
it
was
a
sleepy
hot
and
sticky
wreck
that
answered
to
the
name
of
james
orlebar
cloyster
that
morning
but
i
had
my
first
youth
and
forty
pounds
so
that
soap
and
water
followed
by
coffee
and
an
omelette
soon
restored
me
the
journey
to
waterloo
gave
me
opportunity
for
tobacco
and
reflection
what
chiefly
exercised
me
i
remember
was
the
problem
whether
it
was
possible
to
be
a
bohemian
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
in
love
bohemia
i
looked
on
as
a
region
where
one
became
inevitably
entangled
with
women
of
unquestionable
charm
but
doubtful
morality
there
were
supper
parties
festive
gatherings
in
the
old
studio
babette
lucille
the
artists
ball
were
these
things
possible
for
a
man
with
an
honest
earnest
affection
the
problem
engaged
me
tensely
till
my
ticket
was
collected
at
vauxhall
just
there
the
solution
came
i
would
be
a
bohemian
but
a
misogynist
people
would
say
dear
old
jimmy
cloyster
how
he
hates
women
it
would
add
to
my
character
a
pleasant
touch
of
dignity
and
reserve
which
would
rather
accentuate
my
otherwise
irresponsible
way
of
living
little
did
the
good
bohemians
of
the
metropolis
know
how
keen
a
recruit
the
boat
train
was
bringing
to
them
as
a
i
selected
a
cheap
and
dingy
hotel
in
york
street
and
from
this
base
i
determined
to
locate
my
proper
sphere
chelsea
was
the
first
place
that
occurred
to
me
there
was
wood
of
course
but
that
was
such
a
long
way
off
chelsea
was
comparatively
near
to
the
heart
of
things
and
i
had
heard
that
one
might
find
there
artistic
people
whose
saturnalian
existence
was
redolent
of
that
exquisite
gaiety
which
so
attracted
my
own
casual
temperament
sallying
out
next
morning
into
the
brilliant
sunshine
and
the
dusty
rattle
of
york
street
i
felt
a
sense
of
elation
at
the
thought
that
the
time
for
action
had
come
i
was
in
london
london
the
home
of
the
fragrant
and
the
hooligan
london
the
battlefield
of
the
literary
aspirant
since
caxton
invented
the
printing
press
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
walked
firmly
across
westminster
bridge
that
margie
gazed
at
me
with
the
lovelight
in
her
eyes
and
that
a
species
of
amorous
telepathy
from
guernsey
was
girding
me
for
the
fight
manresa
road
i
had
once
heard
mentioned
as
being
the
heart
of
bohemian
chelsea
to
manresa
road
accordingly
i
went
by
way
of
park
buckingham
palace
road
and
lower
sloane
street
thence
to
sloane
square
here
i
paused
for
i
knew
that
i
had
reached
the
last
outpost
of
respectable
inartistic
london
how
sudden
i
soliloquised
is
the
change
here
i
am
in
sloane
square
regular
and
unimaginative
while
a
few
hundred
yards
away
king
road
leads
me
into
the
very
midst
of
genius
starvation
and
possibly
free
love
sloane
square
indeed
gave
me
the
impression
not
so
much
of
a
suburb
as
of
the
suburban
portion
of
a
great
london
railway
terminus
it
was
positively
pretty
people
were
shopping
with
comparative
leisure
omnibus
horses
were
being
rubbed
down
and
watered
on
the
west
side
of
the
square
out
of
the
way
of
the
main
stream
of
traffic
a
postman
clearing
the
at
the
office
stopped
his
work
momentarily
to
read
the
contents
of
a
postcard
for
the
moment
i
understood
feelings
on
the
brink
of
the
rubicon
and
the
emotions
of
cortes
when
with
eagle
eyes
he
stared
at
the
pacific
i
was
on
the
threshold
of
great
events
behind
me
was
orthodox
london
before
me
the
unknown
it
was
distinctly
a
caesarian
glance
full
of
deliberate
revolt
that
i
bestowed
upon
the
street
called
sloane
that
clean
orderly
thoroughfare
which
leads
to
knightsbridge
and
thence
either
to
the
respectabilities
of
kensington
or
the
plush
of
piccadilly
setting
my
hat
at
a
wild
angle
i
stepped
with
a
touch
of
along
the
king
road
to
meet
the
charming
impoverished
artists
whom
our
country
refuses
to
recognise
my
first
glimpse
of
the
manresa
road
was
i
confess
a
complete
disappointment
never
was
bohemianism
more
handicapped
by
its
setting
than
that
of
chelsea
if
the
manresa
road
was
to
be
taken
as
a
criterion
along
the
uninviting
uniformity
of
this
street
no
trace
of
unorthodoxy
was
to
be
seen
there
came
no
merry
roystering
laughter
from
attic
windows
no
talented
figures
of
idle
geniuses
fetched
pints
of
beer
from
the
at
the
corner
no
one
dressed
in
an
ancient
ulster
and
a
battered
straw
hat
and
puffing
enormous
clouds
of
blue
smoke
from
a
treasured
clay
pipe
gazed
philosophically
into
space
from
a
doorway
in
point
of
fact
save
for
a
most
conventional
i
was
alone
in
the
street
then
the
explanation
flashed
upon
me
i
had
been
seen
approaching
the
word
had
been
passed
round
a
stranger
the
clique
resents
intrusion
it
lies
hid
these
gay
fellows
see
me
all
the
time
and
are
secretly
amused
but
they
do
not
know
with
whom
they
have
to
deal
i
have
come
to
join
them
and
join
them
i
will
i
am
not
easily
beaten
i
will
outlast
them
the
joke
shall
be
eventually
against
them
at
some
eccentric
supper
i
shall
chaff
them
about
how
they
tried
to
elude
me
and
failed
the
hours
passed
still
no
bohemians
i
began
to
grow
hungry
i
sprang
on
to
a
passing
it
took
me
to
victoria
i
lunched
at
the
shakespeare
hotel
smoked
a
pipe
and
went
out
into
the
sunlight
again
it
had
occurred
to
me
that
night
was
perhaps
the
best
time
for
trapping
my
shy
quarry
possibly
the
revels
did
not
begin
in
manresa
road
till
darkness
had
fallen
i
spent
the
afternoon
and
evening
in
the
park
dined
at
lyons
popular
café
it
must
be
remembered
that
i
was
not
yet
a
bohemian
and
consequently
owed
no
deference
to
the
traditions
of
the
order
and
returned
at
nine
to
the
manresa
road
once
more
i
drew
blank
a
played
airs
in
the
middle
of
the
road
but
it
played
to
an
invisible
audience
no
bearded
men
danced
around
it
shouting
merry
jests
to
one
another
solitude
reigned
i
wait
the
duel
continues
what
grim
determination
what
perseverance
can
these
bohemians
put
into
a
mad
jest
i
find
myself
thinking
how
much
better
it
would
be
were
they
to
apply
to
their
art
the
same
earnestness
and
fixity
of
purpose
which
they
squander
on
a
practical
joke
evening
fell
blinds
began
to
be
drawn
down
lamps
were
lit
behind
them
one
by
one
despair
was
gnawing
at
my
heart
but
still
i
waited
then
just
as
i
was
about
to
retire
defeated
i
was
arrested
by
the
appearance
of
a
house
numbered
at
the
window
sat
a
man
he
was
writing
i
could
see
his
profile
his
long
untidy
hair
i
understood
in
a
moment
this
was
no
ordinary
writer
he
was
one
of
those
bohemians
whose
wit
had
been
exercised
upon
me
so
successfully
he
was
a
literary
man
and
though
he
enjoyed
the
sport
as
much
as
any
of
the
others
he
was
under
the
absolute
necessity
of
writing
his
copy
up
to
time
unobserved
by
his
gay
comrades
he
had
slipped
away
to
his
work
they
were
still
watching
me
but
he
probably
owing
to
a
contract
with
some
journal
was
obliged
to
give
up
his
share
in
their
merriment
and
toil
with
his
pen
his
pen
fascinated
me
i
leaned
against
the
railings
of
the
house
opposite
enthralled
ever
and
anon
he
seemed
to
be
consulting
one
or
other
of
the
books
of
reference
piled
up
on
each
side
of
him
doubtless
he
was
preparing
a
scholarly
column
for
a
daily
paper
presently
a
printer
devil
would
arrive
clamouring
for
his
copy
i
knew
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
that
happened
i
had
read
about
it
in
novels
how
unerring
is
instinct
if
properly
cultivated
hardly
had
the
clocks
struck
twelve
when
the
emissaries
there
were
two
of
them
which
showed
the
importance
of
their
errand
walked
briskly
to
no
and
knocked
at
the
door
the
writer
heard
the
knock
he
rose
hurriedly
and
began
to
collect
his
papers
meanwhile
the
knocking
had
been
answered
from
within
by
the
shooting
of
bolts
noises
that
were
followed
by
the
apparition
of
a
female
head
a
few
brief
questions
and
the
emissaries
entered
a
pause
the
litterateur
is
warning
the
menials
that
their
charge
is
sacred
that
the
sheets
he
has
produced
are
impossible
to
replace
high
words
abrupt
of
the
front
door
struggling
humanity
projected
on
to
the
pavement
three
persons
my
scribe
in
the
middle
an
emissary
on
either
side
stagger
strangely
past
me
the
scribe
enters
the
purple
night
only
under
the
stony
compulsion
of
the
emissaries
what
does
this
mean
i
have
it
the
emissaries
have
become
they
dare
not
face
the
responsibility
of
conveying
the
priceless
copy
to
fleet
street
they
have
completely
lost
their
nerve
they
insist
upon
the
author
accompanying
them
to
see
with
his
own
eyes
that
all
is
well
they
do
not
wish
posterity
to
hand
their
names
down
to
eternal
infamy
as
the
men
who
lost
blank
manuscript
so
greatly
against
his
will
he
is
dragged
off
my
vigil
is
rewarded
no
harbours
a
bohemian
let
it
be
inhabited
also
by
me
i
stepped
across
and
rang
the
bell
the
answer
was
a
piercing
scream
ah
ha
i
said
to
myself
complacently
there
are
more
bohemians
than
one
then
in
this
house
the
female
head
again
appeared
not
another
oh
sir
say
there
ai
another
wanted
said
the
head
in
a
passionate
cockney
accent
that
is
precisely
what
there
is
i
replied
i
want
what
for
for
something
moderate
well
that
a
comfort
in
a
wiy
which
of
is
it
you
want
the
back
i
have
no
doubt
the
back
would
do
quite
well
my
words
had
a
curious
effect
she
scrutinised
me
suspiciously
ho
she
said
with
a
sniff
you
do
seem
to
care
much
which
it
is
you
get
i
do
i
said
not
particularly
look
she
exclaimed
you
jest
it
see
i
do
want
none
of
your
here
and
what
more
i
wo
i
believe
you
a
copper
at
all
i
not
far
from
it
then
what
mean
coming
saying
you
want
my
back
but
i
do
or
any
other
room
if
that
is
occupied
why
did
yer
siy
so
you
pawdon
me
sir
if
i
said
anything
i
thought
but
my
mistake
not
at
all
can
you
let
me
have
a
room
i
notice
that
the
gentleman
whom
i
have
just
seen
she
cut
me
short
i
was
about
to
explain
that
i
was
a
bohemian
too
gorn
for
a
stroll
sir
i
expec
him
back
every
moment
forgot
latchkey
thet
why
i
sitting
up
for
driver
my
name
is
sir
that
my
name
and
well
known
in
the
driver
spoke
earnestly
but
breathlessly
i
do
not
contemplate
asking
you
driver
to
give
me
the
apartments
already
engaged
by
the
literary
gentleman
yes
sir
she
interpolated
that
wot
wos
i
mean
is
a
literary
gent
but
have
you
not
another
room
vacant
the
back
sir
very
comfortable
nice
room
sir
shady
in
the
morning
and
gets
the
setting
sun
had
the
meteorological
conditions
been
adverse
to
the
point
of
malignancy
i
should
have
closed
with
her
terms
simple
agreements
were
ratified
then
and
there
by
the
light
of
a
candle
in
the
passage
and
i
left
the
house
promising
to
come
in
in
the
course
of
the
following
afternoon
chapter
i
evacuate
bohemia
james
orlebar
cloister
narrative
continued
the
three
weeks
which
i
spent
at
no
mark
an
epoch
in
my
life
it
was
during
that
period
that
i
came
nearest
to
realising
my
ambition
to
be
a
bohemian
and
at
the
end
of
the
third
week
for
reasons
which
i
shall
state
i
deserted
bohemia
firmly
and
with
no
longing
lingering
glance
behind
and
settled
down
to
the
prosaic
task
of
grubbing
earnestly
for
money
the
back
had
a
cupboard
of
a
bedroom
leading
out
of
it
even
i
desirous
as
i
was
of
seeing
romance
in
everything
could
not
call
my
lodgings
anything
but
dingy
dark
and
commonplace
they
were
just
like
a
million
other
of
london
mean
lodgings
the
window
looked
out
over
a
sea
of
backyards
bounded
by
tall
depressing
houses
and
intersected
by
a
cats
club
social
musical
and
pugilistic
used
to
meet
on
the
wall
to
the
right
of
my
window
one
or
two
dissipated
trees
gave
the
finishing
touch
of
gloom
to
the
scene
nor
was
the
interior
of
the
room
more
cheerful
the
furniture
had
been
put
in
during
the
reign
of
george
iii
and
last
dusted
in
that
of
william
and
mary
a
black
sofa
ran
along
one
wall
there
was
a
deal
table
a
chair
and
a
rickety
bookcase
it
was
a
room
for
a
realist
to
write
in
and
my
style
such
as
it
was
was
bright
and
optimistic
once
in
i
set
about
the
task
of
ornamenting
my
abode
with
much
vigour
i
had
my
own
ideas
of
mural
decoration
i
papered
the
walls
with
editorial
rejection
forms
of
which
i
was
beginning
to
have
a
representative
collection
properly
arranged
these
look
very
striking
there
is
a
good
deal
of
variety
about
them
the
ones
i
liked
best
were
those
which
i
received
at
the
rate
of
three
a
week
bearing
a
very
pleasing
picture
in
green
of
the
publishing
offices
at
the
top
of
the
sheet
of
scattered
about
in
sufficient
quantities
these
lend
an
air
of
distinction
to
a
room
also
supplies
a
taking
line
in
rejection
forms
i
never
cared
for
very
much
neat
i
grant
you
but
to
my
mind
too
cold
i
like
a
touch
of
colour
in
a
rejection
form
in
addition
to
these
i
purchased
from
the
grocer
at
the
corner
a
collection
of
pictorial
advertisements
what
i
had
really
wanted
was
the
theatrical
poster
printed
and
signed
by
artists
but
the
grocer
did
keep
them
and
i
was
impatient
to
create
my
proper
atmosphere
my
next
step
was
to
buy
a
corncob
pipe
and
a
quantity
of
rank
tobacco
i
hated
both
and
kept
them
more
as
ornaments
than
for
use
then
having
hacked
my
table
about
with
a
knife
and
battered
it
with
a
poker
till
it
might
have
been
the
table
of
a
shaggy
and
unrecognised
genius
i
settled
down
to
work
i
was
not
a
brilliant
success
i
had
that
little
knowledge
which
is
held
to
be
such
a
dangerous
thing
i
had
not
plunged
into
the
literary
profession
without
learning
a
few
facts
about
it
i
had
read
nearly
every
journalistic
novel
and
hints
on
writing
for
the
papers
book
that
had
ever
been
published
in
theory
i
knew
all
that
there
was
to
be
known
about
writing
now
all
my
authorities
were
very
strong
on
one
point
write
they
said
very
loud
and
clear
not
what
like
but
what
editors
like
i
smiled
to
myself
when
i
started
i
felt
that
i
had
stolen
a
march
on
my
rivals
all
round
me
i
said
to
myself
are
young
authors
bombarding
editors
with
essays
on
lucretius
translations
of
martial
and
disquisitions
on
ionic
comedy
i
know
too
much
for
that
i
work
on
a
different
plan
study
the
papers
and
see
what
they
want
said
my
authorities
i
studied
the
papers
some
wanted
one
thing
apparently
others
another
there
was
one
group
of
three
papers
whose
needs
seemed
to
coincide
and
i
could
see
an
article
rejected
by
one
paper
being
taken
by
another
this
offered
me
a
number
of
chances
instead
of
one
i
could
back
my
mss
to
win
or
for
a
place
i
began
a
serious
siege
of
these
three
papers
by
the
end
of
the
second
week
i
had
had
curious
freaks
of
eccentric
testators
singular
scenes
in
court
actors
who
have
died
on
the
stage
curious
scenes
in
church
and
seven
others
rejected
by
all
three
somehow
this
sort
of
writing
is
not
so
easy
as
it
looks
a
man
who
was
on
the
staff
of
a
weekly
once
told
me
that
he
had
had
two
thousand
of
these
articles
printed
since
he
started
poor
devil
he
had
the
knack
i
could
never
get
it
i
sent
up
in
all
in
the
first
year
of
my
literary
life
and
only
two
stuck
i
got
fifteen
shillings
from
one
periodical
for
men
who
have
missed
their
own
weddings
and
later
a
guinea
from
the
same
for
single
day
marriages
that
paper
has
a
penchant
for
the
yet
when
i
sent
it
my
duchesses
who
have
married
dustmen
it
came
back
by
the
early
post
next
day
that
was
to
me
the
worst
part
of
those
grey
days
i
had
my
victories
but
they
were
always
followed
by
a
series
of
defeats
i
would
have
a
manuscript
accepted
by
an
editor
hullo
i
would
say
here
the
man
at
last
the
let
the
thing
go
on
i
would
send
him
off
another
manuscript
he
would
take
it
victory
by
jove
then
back
would
come
my
third
effort
with
the
curtest
of
refusals
i
always
imagined
editors
in
those
days
to
be
pettish
whimsical
men
who
amused
themselves
by
taking
up
a
beginner
and
then
wearying
of
the
sport
dropped
him
back
into
the
slime
from
which
they
had
picked
him
in
the
intervals
of
articles
i
wrote
short
stories
again
for
the
same
three
papers
as
before
i
studied
these
papers
carefully
to
see
what
they
wanted
then
worked
out
a
mechanical
plot
invariably
with
a
quarrel
in
the
first
part
an
accident
and
a
rescue
in
the
middle
and
a
reconciliation
at
the
end
told
it
in
a
style
that
makes
me
hot
all
over
when
i
think
of
it
and
sent
it
up
enclosing
a
stamped
addressed
envelope
in
case
of
rejection
a
very
useful
precaution
as
it
always
turned
out
it
was
the
little
knowledge
to
which
i
have
referred
above
which
kept
my
walls
so
thickly
covered
with
rejection
forms
i
was
in
precisely
the
same
condition
as
a
man
who
has
been
taught
the
rudiments
of
boxing
i
knew
just
enough
to
hamper
me
and
not
enough
to
do
me
any
good
if
i
had
simply
blundered
straight
at
my
work
and
written
just
what
occurred
to
me
in
my
own
style
i
should
have
done
much
better
i
have
a
sense
of
humour
i
deliberately
stifled
it
for
it
i
substituted
a
grisly
kind
of
playfulness
my
hero
called
my
heroine
little
woman
and
the
concluding
passage
where
he
kissed
her
was
written
in
a
sly
roguish
vein
for
which
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
atone
in
the
next
world
only
the
editor
of
the
hatch
could
have
accepted
work
like
mine
yet
i
toiled
on
it
was
about
the
middle
of
my
third
week
at
no
that
i
definitely
decided
to
throw
over
my
authorities
and
work
by
the
light
of
my
own
intelligence
nearly
all
my
authorities
had
been
very
severe
on
the
practice
of
it
was
they
asserted
what
all
young
beginners
tried
to
do
and
it
was
the
one
thing
editors
would
never
look
at
in
the
first
ardour
of
my
revolt
i
determined
to
do
a
set
of
verses
it
happened
that
the
weather
had
been
very
bad
for
the
last
few
days
after
a
month
and
a
half
of
sunshine
the
rain
had
suddenly
begun
to
fall
i
took
this
as
my
topic
it
was
raining
at
the
time
i
wrote
a
satirical
poem
full
of
quaint
rhymes
i
had
always
had
rather
a
turn
for
serious
verse
it
struck
me
that
the
rain
might
be
treated
poetically
as
well
as
satirically
that
night
i
sent
off
two
sets
of
verses
to
a
daily
and
an
evening
paper
next
day
both
were
in
print
with
my
initials
to
them
i
began
to
see
light
verse
is
the
thing
i
said
i
will
reorganise
my
campaign
first
the
skirmishers
then
the
real
attack
i
will
peg
along
with
verses
till
somebody
begins
to
take
my
stories
and
articles
i
felt
easier
in
my
mind
than
i
had
felt
for
some
time
a
story
came
back
by
the
nine
post
from
a
monthly
magazine
to
which
i
had
sent
it
from
mere
bravado
but
the
thing
did
not
depress
me
i
got
out
my
and
began
to
fasten
the
rejection
form
to
the
wall
whistling
a
lively
air
as
i
did
so
while
i
was
engaged
in
this
occupation
there
was
a
testy
rap
at
the
door
and
driver
appeared
she
eyed
my
manoeuvres
with
the
rejection
form
with
a
severe
frown
after
a
preliminary
sniff
she
embarked
upon
a
rapid
lecture
on
what
she
called
my
irregular
and
untidy
habits
i
had
turned
her
back
she
declared
into
a
sech
a
litter
she
said
but
i
protested
this
is
a
bohemian
house
is
it
not
she
appeared
so
shocked
indeed
so
infuriated
that
i
dared
not
give
her
time
to
answer
the
gentleman
below
he
not
very
tidy
i
added
diplomatically
wot
gent
below
said
driver
i
reminded
her
of
the
night
of
my
arrival
oh
she
said
shaken
well
not
come
back
driver
i
said
sternly
you
said
he
gone
out
for
a
stroll
i
refuse
to
believe
that
any
man
would
stroll
for
three
weeks
so
i
did
say
it
was
the
defiant
reply
i
said
it
so
as
you
should
be
put
off
coming
you
looked
a
steady
young
feller
and
i
wanted
a
let
wish
i
told
you
the
truth
if
it
you
what
is
the
truth
was
a
wrong
wos
writing
begging
letters
to
parties
as
was
a
bit
soft
that
wos
little
gime
but
wos
a
bit
too
clever
one
day
and
the
coppers
got
now
you
know
driver
paused
after
this
outburst
and
allowed
her
eye
to
wander
slowly
and
ominously
round
my
walls
i
was
deeply
moved
my
one
link
with
bohemia
had
turned
out
a
fraud
driver
voice
roused
me
from
my
meditations
i
must
arst
you
to
be
good
enough
if
please
kindly
to
remove
those
there
bits
of
paper
she
pointed
to
the
rejection
forms
i
hesitated
i
felt
that
it
was
a
thing
that
ought
to
be
broken
gently
the
fact
is
driver
i
said
and
no
one
can
regret
it
more
deeply
than
i
do
the
fact
is
they
stuck
on
with
glue
two
minutes
later
i
had
received
my
marching
orders
and
the
room
was
still
echoing
with
the
slam
of
the
door
as
it
closed
behind
the
indignant
form
of
my
landlady
chapter
the
orb
james
orlebar
cloyster
narrative
continued
the
problem
of
lodgings
in
london
is
an
easy
one
to
a
man
with
an
adequate
supply
of
money
in
his
pocket
the
only
difficulty
is
to
select
the
most
suitable
to
single
out
from
the
eager
crowd
the
ideal
landlady
evicted
from
no
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
better
abandon
bohemia
postpone
my
connection
with
that
land
of
for
the
moment
while
i
provided
myself
with
the
means
of
paying
rent
and
buying
dinners
farther
down
the
king
road
there
were
comfortable
rooms
to
be
had
for
a
moderate
sum
per
week
they
were
prosaic
but
inexpensive
i
chose
walpole
street
a
fairly
large
room
was
vacant
at
no
i
took
it
and
settled
down
seriously
to
make
my
writing
pay
there
were
advantages
in
walpole
street
which
manresa
road
had
lacked
for
one
thing
there
was
more
air
and
it
smelt
less
than
the
manresa
road
air
walpole
street
is
bounded
by
burton
court
where
the
household
brigade
plays
cricket
and
the
breezes
from
the
river
come
to
it
without
much
interruption
there
was
also
more
quiet
no
is
the
last
house
in
the
street
and
even
when
i
sat
with
my
window
open
the
noise
of
traffic
from
the
king
road
was
faint
and
rather
pleasant
it
was
an
excellent
spot
for
a
man
who
meant
to
work
except
for
a
certain
difficulty
in
getting
my
landlady
and
her
daughters
out
of
the
room
when
they
came
to
clear
away
my
meals
and
talk
about
the
better
days
they
had
seen
and
a
few
imbroglios
with
the
eight
cats
which
infested
the
house
it
was
the
best
spot
i
think
that
i
could
have
chosen
living
a
life
ruled
by
the
strictest
economy
i
gradually
forged
ahead
verse
light
and
serious
continued
my
long
suit
i
generally
managed
to
place
two
of
each
brand
a
week
and
that
meant
two
guineas
sometimes
more
one
particularly
pleasing
thing
about
this
was
that
there
was
no
delay
as
there
was
with
my
prose
i
would
write
a
set
of
verses
for
a
daily
paper
after
tea
walk
to
fleet
street
with
them
at
six
thus
getting
a
little
exercise
leave
them
at
the
office
and
i
would
see
them
in
print
in
the
next
morning
issue
payment
was
equally
prompt
the
rule
was
send
in
your
bill
before
five
on
wednesday
and
call
for
payment
on
friday
at
seven
thus
i
had
always
enough
money
to
keep
me
going
during
the
week
in
addition
to
verses
i
kept
turning
out
a
great
quantity
of
prose
fiction
and
otherwise
but
without
much
success
the
visits
of
the
postmen
were
the
big
events
of
the
day
at
that
time
before
i
had
been
in
walpole
street
a
week
i
could
tell
by
ear
the
difference
between
a
rejected
manuscript
and
an
ordinary
letter
there
is
a
certain
solid
about
the
fall
of
the
former
which
not
even
a
long
envelope
full
of
proofs
can
imitate
successfully
i
worked
extraordinarily
hard
at
that
time
all
day
sometimes
the
thought
of
margie
waiting
in
guernsey
kept
me
writing
when
i
should
have
done
better
to
have
taken
a
rest
my
earnings
were
small
in
proportion
to
my
labour
the
guineas
i
made
except
from
verse
were
like
the
ounce
of
gold
to
the
ton
of
ore
i
no
longer
papered
the
walls
with
rejection
forms
but
this
was
from
choice
not
from
necessity
i
had
plenty
of
material
had
i
cared
to
use
it
i
made
a
little
money
of
course
my
takings
for
the
first
month
amounted
to
i
notched
double
figures
in
the
next
with
then
i
dropped
to
it
was
not
starvation
but
it
was
still
more
unlike
matrimony
but
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
month
there
happened
to
me
what
looking
back
i
consider
to
be
the
greatest
piece
of
good
fortune
of
my
life
i
received
a
literary
introduction
some
authorities
scoff
at
literary
introductions
they
say
that
editors
read
everything
whether
they
know
the
author
or
not
so
they
do
and
if
the
work
is
not
good
a
letter
to
the
editor
from
a
man
who
once
met
his
cousin
at
a
is
not
likely
to
induce
him
to
print
it
there
is
no
journalistic
ring
in
the
sense
in
which
the
word
is
generally
used
but
there
are
undoubtedly
a
certain
number
of
men
who
know
the
ropes
and
can
act
as
pilots
in
a
strange
sea
and
an
introduction
brings
one
into
touch
with
them
there
is
a
world
of
difference
between
contributing
blindly
work
which
seems
suitable
to
the
style
of
a
paper
and
sending
in
matter
designed
to
attract
the
editor
personally
macrae
whose
pupil
i
had
been
at
cambridge
was
the
author
of
my
letter
of
introduction
at
gabriel
macrae
had
been
a
man
for
whom
i
entertained
awe
and
respect
likes
and
dislikes
in
connection
with
one
tutor
seemed
outside
the
question
only
a
chance
episode
had
shown
me
that
my
tutor
was
a
mortal
with
a
mortal
limitations
we
were
bicycling
together
one
day
along
the
trumpington
road
when
a
form
appeared
coming
to
meet
us
my
tutor
speech
grew
more
and
more
halting
as
the
form
came
nearer
at
last
he
stopped
talking
altogether
and
wobbled
in
his
saddle
the
man
bowed
to
him
and
as
if
he
had
won
through
some
fiery
ordeal
he
shot
ahead
like
a
gay
professional
rider
when
i
drew
level
with
him
he
said
that
cloyster
is
my
tailor
macrae
was
typical
of
the
university
don
who
is
scotch
he
had
married
the
senior
historian
of
newnham
he
lived
and
still
lives
by
proxy
his
publishers
order
his
existence
his
honeymoon
had
been
placed
at
the
disposal
of
these
gentlemen
and
they
had
allotted
to
that
period
an
edition
of
aristotle
ethics
aristotle
accordingly
received
the
most
scholarly
attention
from
the
recently
united
couple
somewhere
on
the
slopes
of
mount
parnassus
all
the
reviews
were
satisfactory
in
my
third
year
at
gabriel
it
was
popularly
supposed
that
master
pericles
aeschylus
macrae
infant
son
was
turned
to
correct
my
latin
prose
though
my
iambics
were
withheld
from
him
at
the
request
of
the
family
doctor
the
letter
which
pericles
aeschylus
father
had
addressed
to
me
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
surprises
i
have
ever
had
it
ran
as
follows
gabriel
college
my
dear
cloyster
the
divergence
of
our
duties
and
pleasures
during
your
residence
here
caused
us
to
see
but
little
of
each
other
would
it
had
been
otherwise
and
too
often
our
intercourse
had
on
my
side
a
distinctly
professional
flavour
your
attitude
towards
your
religious
obligations
was
i
fear
something
to
seek
indeed
the
line
deorum
cultor
et
might
have
been
directly
inspired
by
your
views
on
the
keeping
of
chapels
on
the
other
hand
your
contributions
to
our
musical
festivities
had
the
true
aristophanes
i
hear
you
are
devoting
yourself
to
literature
and
i
beg
that
you
will
avail
yourself
of
the
enclosed
note
which
is
addressed
to
a
personal
friend
of
mine
believe
me
david
ossian
the
enclosure
bore
this
inscription
charles
fermin
offices
of
the
strand
london
i
had
received
the
letter
at
breakfast
i
took
a
cab
and
drove
straight
to
the
a
painted
hand
marked
editorial
indicated
a
flight
of
stairs
at
the
top
of
these
i
was
confronted
by
a
glass
door
beyond
which
entrenched
behind
a
desk
sat
a
youth
a
smaller
boy
in
the
background
talked
into
a
telephone
both
were
giggling
on
seeing
me
the
slightly
larger
of
the
two
advanced
with
a
attempt
at
solemnity
though
unable
to
resist
a
parthian
shaft
at
his
companion
who
was
seized
on
the
instant
with
a
paroxysm
of
suppressed
hysteria
my
letter
was
taken
down
a
mysterious
stone
passage
after
some
waiting
the
messenger
returned
with
the
request
that
i
would
come
back
at
eleven
as
fermin
would
be
very
busy
till
then
i
went
out
into
the
strand
and
sought
a
neighbouring
hostelry
it
was
essential
that
i
should
be
brilliant
at
the
coming
interview
if
only
spirituously
brilliant
and
i
wished
to
remove
a
sensation
of
stomachic
emptiness
such
as
i
had
been
wont
to
feel
at
school
when
approaching
the
headmaster
study
at
eleven
i
returned
and
asked
again
for
fermin
and
presently
he
appeared
a
tall
thin
man
who
gave
one
the
impression
of
being
in
a
hurry
i
knew
him
by
reputation
as
a
famous
he
had
been
president
of
the
some
years
back
he
looked
as
if
at
any
moment
he
might
dash
off
in
any
direction
at
pace
we
shook
hands
and
i
tried
to
look
intelligent
sorry
to
have
to
keep
you
waiting
he
said
as
we
walked
to
his
club
but
we
are
always
rather
busy
between
ten
and
eleven
putting
the
column
through
gresham
and
i
do
your
way
you
know
the
last
copy
has
to
be
down
by
ten
we
arrived
at
the
club
and
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
lower
macrae
says
that
you
are
going
in
for
writing
of
course
i
do
anything
i
can
but
it
is
easy
to
help
a
man
as
it
happens
though
i
can
put
you
in
the
way
of
something
if
it
your
style
of
work
do
you
ever
do
verse
i
felt
like
a
batsman
who
sees
a
slow
sailing
through
the
air
it
the
only
thing
i
can
get
taken
i
said
i
had
quite
a
lot
in
the
and
occasional
bits
in
other
papers
he
seemed
relieved
oh
that
all
right
then
he
said
you
know
your
way
perhaps
you
care
to
come
in
and
do
that
for
a
bit
it
only
holiday
work
but
it
last
five
weeks
and
if
you
do
it
all
right
i
can
get
you
the
whole
of
the
holiday
work
on
the
column
that
comes
to
a
good
lot
in
the
year
we
always
taking
odd
days
off
can
you
come
up
at
a
moment
notice
easily
i
said
then
you
see
if
you
did
that
you
would
drop
into
the
next
vacancy
on
the
column
there
no
saying
when
one
may
occur
it
like
the
general
election
it
may
happen
tomorrow
or
not
for
years
still
you
be
on
the
spot
in
case
it
awfully
good
of
you
not
at
all
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
rather
in
difficulties
about
getting
a
holiday
man
i
off
to
scotland
the
day
after
tomorrow
and
i
had
to
find
a
sub
well
then
will
you
come
in
on
monday
all
right
you
had
no
experience
of
newspaper
work
have
you
no
well
all
the
work
at
the
done
between
nine
and
eleven
you
must
be
there
at
nine
sharp
literally
sharp
i
mean
not
and
you
better
do
some
stuff
overnight
for
the
first
week
or
so
you
find
working
in
the
office
difficult
till
you
get
used
to
it
of
course
though
you
always
have
gresham
there
so
there
no
need
to
get
worried
he
can
fill
the
column
himself
if
he
pushed
four
or
five
really
good
paragraphs
a
day
and
an
occasional
set
of
verses
are
all
he
want
from
you
i
see
on
monday
then
nine
sharp
i
walked
home
along
piccadilly
with
almost
a
stride
at
last
i
was
in
the
inner
circle
an
cart
passed
me
i
nodded
cheerfully
to
the
driver
he
was
one
of
chapter
julian
eversleigh
james
orlebar
cloyster
narrative
continued
i
determined
to
celebrate
the
occasion
by
dining
out
going
to
a
theatre
and
having
supper
afterwards
none
of
which
things
were
ordinarily
within
my
means
i
had
not
been
to
a
theatre
since
i
had
arrived
in
town
and
except
on
saturday
nights
i
always
cooked
my
own
dinner
a
process
which
was
cheap
and
which
appealed
to
the
passion
for
bohemianism
which
i
had
not
wholly
cast
out
of
me
the
morning
paper
informed
me
that
there
were
eleven
musical
comedies
three
shakespeare
plays
a
blank
verse
drama
and
two
comedies
last
weeks
for
me
to
choose
from
i
bought
a
stall
at
the
briggs
theatre
stanley
briggs
who
afterwards
came
to
bulk
large
in
my
small
world
was
playing
there
in
a
musical
comedy
which
had
had
even
more
than
the
customary
success
london
by
night
had
always
had
an
immense
fascination
for
me
coming
out
of
the
restaurant
after
supper
i
felt
no
inclination
to
return
to
my
lodgings
and
end
the
greatest
night
of
my
life
tamely
with
a
book
and
a
pipe
here
was
i
a
young
man
fortified
by
an
excellent
supper
in
the
heart
of
stevenson
london
why
should
i
have
no
new
arabian
night
adventure
i
would
stroll
about
for
half
an
hour
and
give
london
a
chance
of
living
up
to
its
reputation
i
walked
slowly
along
piccadilly
and
turned
up
rupert
street
a
magic
name
prince
florizel
of
bohemia
had
ended
his
days
there
in
his
tobacconist
divan
gilbert
policeman
forth
had
been
discovered
there
by
the
men
of
london
at
the
end
of
his
long
wanderings
through
soho
probably
if
the
truth
were
known
rudolf
rassendyl
had
spent
part
of
his
time
there
it
could
not
be
that
rupert
street
would
send
me
empty
away
my
confidence
was
not
abused
turning
into
rupert
court
a
dark
and
suggestive
passage
some
short
distance
up
the
street
on
the
right
i
found
a
curious
little
comedy
being
played
a
door
gave
on
to
the
deserted
passageway
and
on
each
side
of
it
stood
a
man
the
lurcher
type
of
man
that
is
bred
of
london
streets
the
door
opened
inwards
another
man
stepped
out
the
hands
of
one
of
the
lurchers
flew
to
the
newcomer
mouth
the
hands
of
the
other
lurcher
flew
to
the
newcomer
pockets
at
that
moment
i
advanced
the
lurchers
vanished
noiselessly
and
instantaneously
their
victim
held
out
his
hand
come
in
wo
you
he
said
smiling
sleepily
at
me
i
followed
him
in
murmuring
something
about
caught
in
the
act
he
repeated
the
phrase
as
we
went
upstairs
in
the
act
yes
they
are
ingenious
creatures
let
me
introduce
myself
my
name
is
julian
eversleigh
sit
down
wo
you
excuse
me
for
a
moment
he
crossed
to
a
julian
eversleigh
inhabited
a
single
room
of
irregular
shape
it
was
small
and
situated
immediately
under
the
roof
one
side
had
a
window
which
overlooked
rupert
court
the
view
from
it
was
however
restricted
because
the
window
was
inset
so
that
the
walls
projecting
on
either
side
prevented
one
seeing
more
than
a
yard
or
two
of
the
court
the
room
contained
a
hammock
a
large
tin
bath
propped
up
against
the
wall
a
big
wardrobe
a
couple
of
bookcases
a
deal
at
which
the
proprietor
was
now
sitting
with
a
pen
in
his
mouth
gazing
at
the
ceiling
and
a
formation
of
rugs
and
cube
sugar
boxes
the
owner
of
this
mixed
lot
of
furniture
wore
a
very
faded
blue
serge
suit
the
trousers
baggy
at
the
knees
and
the
coat
threadbare
at
the
elbows
he
had
the
odd
expression
which
green
eyes
combined
with
red
hair
give
a
man
caught
in
the
act
he
was
murmuring
caught
in
the
act
the
phrase
seemed
to
fascinate
him
i
had
established
myself
on
the
divan
and
was
puffing
at
a
cigar
which
i
had
bought
by
way
of
setting
the
on
my
extravagance
before
he
got
up
from
his
writing
those
fellows
he
said
producing
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
a
syphon
from
one
of
the
lower
drawers
of
the
wardrobe
did
me
a
double
service
they
introduced
me
to
you
say
when
and
they
gave
me
when
an
idea
but
how
did
it
happen
i
asked
quite
simple
he
answered
you
see
my
friends
when
they
call
on
me
late
at
night
ca
get
in
by
knocking
at
the
front
door
it
is
a
and
is
locked
early
vancott
my
landlord
is
a
baker
and
as
he
has
to
be
up
making
muffins
somewhere
about
five
in
the
morning
we
all
have
our
troubles
he
does
not
stop
up
late
so
people
who
want
me
go
into
the
court
and
see
whether
my
lamp
is
burning
by
the
window
if
it
is
they
stand
below
and
shout
till
i
open
the
door
into
the
court
that
what
happened
tonight
i
heard
my
name
called
went
down
and
walked
into
the
arms
of
the
enterprising
gentlemen
whom
you
chanced
to
notice
they
must
have
been
very
hungry
for
even
if
they
had
carried
the
job
through
they
could
not
have
expected
to
make
their
fortunes
in
point
of
fact
they
would
have
cleared
but
when
you
hungry
you
can
see
no
further
than
the
pit
of
your
stomach
do
you
know
i
almost
sympathise
with
the
poor
brutes
people
sometimes
say
to
me
are
you
i
have
often
half
a
mind
to
reply
have
been
hungry
my
stars
be
hungry
once
and
you
educated
if
you
do
die
of
it
for
a
lifetime
this
sort
of
talk
from
a
stranger
might
have
been
the
prelude
to
an
appeal
for
financial
assistance
he
dissipated
that
thought
do
be
uneasy
he
said
you
have
not
been
lured
up
here
by
the
ruse
of
a
clever
borrower
i
can
do
a
bit
of
touching
when
in
the
mood
mind
you
but
you
safe
you
are
here
because
i
see
that
you
are
a
pleasant
fellow
thank
you
i
said
besides
he
continued
i
am
not
hungry
at
present
in
fact
i
shall
never
be
hungry
again
you
lucky
i
remarked
i
am
i
am
the
fortunate
possessor
of
the
knack
of
writing
advertisements
indeed
i
said
feeling
awkward
for
i
saw
that
i
ought
to
be
impressed
ah
he
said
laughing
outright
you
not
impressed
in
the
least
really
but
i
ask
you
to
consider
what
advertisements
mean
first
they
are
the
of
every
newspaper
every
periodical
and
every
book
every
book
practically
yes
most
books
contain
some
latent
support
of
a
fashion
in
clothes
or
food
or
drink
or
of
some
pleasant
spot
or
phase
of
benevolence
or
vice
all
of
which
form
the
interest
of
one
or
other
of
the
sections
of
society
which
sections
require
publicity
at
all
costs
for
their
respective
interests
i
was
about
to
probe
searchingly
into
so
optimistic
a
view
of
modern
authorship
but
he
stalled
me
off
by
proceeding
rapidly
with
his
discourse
apart
however
from
the
less
obvious
modes
of
advertising
agree
that
this
is
the
age
of
all
ages
for
the
man
who
can
write
puffs
wine
needs
no
bush
has
become
a
trade
paradox
by
appearances
a
commercial
platitude
the
man
who
is
ambitious
and
industrious
turns
his
trick
of
writing
into
purely
literary
channels
and
becomes
a
novelist
the
man
who
is
not
ambitious
and
not
industrious
and
who
does
not
relish
the
prospect
of
becoming
a
loafer
in
strand
writes
advertisements
the
area
is
always
growing
it
a
tom
tiddler
ground
it
is
simply
a
question
of
picking
up
the
gold
and
silver
the
industrious
man
picks
up
as
much
as
he
wants
personally
i
am
easily
content
an
occasional
nugget
satisfies
me
here
tonight
nugget
for
instance
i
took
the
paper
he
handed
to
me
it
bore
the
words
caught
in
the
act
caught
in
the
act
of
drinking
skeffington
sloe
gin
a
man
will
always
present
a
happy
and
smiling
appearance
skeffington
sloe
gin
adds
a
crowning
pleasure
to
prosperity
and
is
a
consolation
in
adversity
of
all
grocers
skeffington
he
said
pay
me
well
i
worth
money
to
them
and
they
know
it
at
present
they
are
giving
me
a
retainer
to
keep
my
work
exclusively
for
them
the
stuff
they
have
put
on
the
market
is
neither
better
nor
worse
than
the
average
sloe
gin
but
my
advertisements
have
given
it
a
tremendous
vogue
it
is
the
only
brand
that
grocers
stock
since
i
made
the
firm
issue
a
weekly
paper
called
poultry
free
to
all
country
customers
the
consumption
of
sloe
gin
has
been
enormous
among
agriculturists
my
idea
too
of
supplying
suburban
buyers
gratis
with
a
small
skeleton
illustrations
and
four
coloured
chalks
has
made
the
drink
popular
with
children
you
must
have
seen
the
poster
i
designed
there
a
reduced
copy
behind
you
the
father
of
a
family
is
unwrapping
a
bottle
of
skeffington
sloe
gin
his
little
ones
crowd
round
him
laughing
and
clapping
their
hands
the
man

is
seen
peeping
roguishly
in
through
the
door
beneath
is
the
popular
ai
mother
going
to
none
you
a
genius
i
cried
hardly
that
he
said
at
least
i
have
no
infinite
capacity
for
taking
pains
i
am
one
of
nature
slackers
despite
my
talent
for
drawing
up
advertisements
i
am
often
in
great
straits
owing
to
my
natural
inertia
and
a
passionate
love
of
sleep
i
sleep
on
the
slightest
provocation
or
excuse
i
will
back
myself
to
sleep
against
anyone
in
the
world
no
age
weight
or
colour
barred
you
i
should
say
are
of
a
different
temperament
more
energetic
the
get
on
or
get
out
sort
of
thing
the
young
hustler
rather
i
replied
briskly
i
am
in
love
so
am
i
said
julian
eversleigh
hopelessly
however
give
us
a
match
after
that
we
confirmed
our
friendship
by
smoking
a
number
of
pipes
together
chapter
the
column
james
orlebar
cloyster
narrative
continued
after
the
first
week
on
your
way
on
the
offered
hardly
any
difficulty
the
source
of
material
was
the
morning
papers
which
were
placed
in
a
pile
on
our
table
at
nine
the
halfpenny
papers
were
our
principal
support
gresham
and
i
each
took
one
and
picked
it
clean
we
attended
first
to
the
subject
of
the
day
this
was
generally
good
for
two
or
three
paragraphs
of
verbal
fooling
there
was
a
sort
of
tradition
that
the
first
paragraphs
should
be
topical
the
rest
might
be
topical
or
not
as
occasion
served
the
column
usually
opened
with
a
pun
gresham
invention
gresham
was
a
man
of
unparalleled
energy
and
ingenuity
he
had
created
several
of
the
typical
characters
who
appeared
from
time
to
time
in
on
your
way
as
for
instance
jenkinson
our
malaprop
and
jones
junior
our
howler
manufacturing
schoolboy
he
was
also
a
stout
apostle
of
a
mode
of
expression
which
he
called
funny
language
thus
instead
of
writing
boldly
there
is
a
rumour
that
i
was
taught
to
say
it
has
got
about
that
this
sounds
funnier
in
print
so
gresham
said
i
could
never
see
it
myself
gresham
had
a
way
of
seizing
on
any
bizarre
incident
reported
in
the
morning
papers
enfolding
it
in
funny
language
adding
a
pun
and
thus
making
it
his
own
he
had
a
cunning
mastery
of
periphrasis
and
a
telling
command
of
adverbs
here
is
an
illustration
an
account
was
given
one
morning
by
the
central
news
of
the
breaking
into
of
a
house
at
johnsonville
by
a
negro
who
had
stolen
a
quantity
of
greenbacks
the
thief
escaping
across
some
fields
was
attacked
by
a
cow
which
after
severely
injuring
the
negro
ate
the
greenbacks
gresham
unacknowledged
version
of
the
episode
ran
as
follows
the
sleepy
god
had
got
the
stranglehold
on
john
denville
when
caesar
bones
a
coloured
gentleman
entered
john
house
at
johnsonville
about
midnight
did
the
nocturnal
caller
disturb
his
slumbering
host
no
caesar
bones
has
the
finer
feelings
but
as
he
was
noiselessly
retiring
what
did
he
see
why
a
pile
of
greenbacks
which
john
had
thoughtlessly
put
away
in
a
safe
to
prevent
the
story
being
cut
out
by
the
editor
who
revised
all
the
proofs
of
the
column
with
the
words
too
long
scribbled
against
it
gresham
continued
his
tale
in
another
paragraph
am
berry
insecure
murmured
the
visitor
to
himself
transplanting
the
notes
in
a
neighbourly
way
into
his
pocket
mark
the
sequel
the
noble
caesar
met
on
his
homeward
path
an
irritable
cudster
the
encounter
was
brief
caesar
went
weak
in
the
second
round
and
took
the
count
in
the
third
elated
by
her
triumph
and
hungry
from
her
exertions
the
horned
quadruped
nosed
the
wad
of
paper
money
and
daringly
devoured
it
caesar
has
told
the
court
that
if
he
is
convicted
of
felony
he
will
arraign
the
owner
of
the
bovine
on
a
charge
of
receiving
stolen
goods
the
owner
merely
ejaculates
male
on
his
day
gresham
could
write
the
column
and
have
a
hundred
lines
over
by
ten
i
too
found
plenty
of
copy
as
a
rule
though
i
continued
my
practice
of
doing
a
few
paragraphs
overnight
but
every
now
and
then
fearful
days
would
come
when
the
papers
were
empty
of
material
for
our
purposes
and
when
two
out
of
every
paragraphs
which
we
did
succeed
in
hammering
out
were
returned
deleted
on
the
editor
proof
the
tension
at
these
times
used
to
be
acute
the
head
printer
would
send
up
a
relay
of
small
and
grubby
boys
to
remind
us
that
on
your
way
was
fifty
lines
short
at
ten
he
would
come
in
person
and
be
plaintive
gresham
the
old
hand
applied
to
such
occasions
desperate
remedies
he
would
manufacture
out
of
even
the
most
pointless
item
of
news
two
paragraphs
by
adding
to
his
first
the
words
this
reminds
us
of
punch
famous
story
he
would
then
go
through
the
bound
volumes
of
we
had
about
a
dozen
in
the
room
with
lightning
speed
until
he
chanced
upon
a
more
or
less
appropriate
tag
those
were
mornings
when
verses
would
be
padded
out
from
three
stanzas
to
five
gresham
turning
them
out
under
fifteen
minutes
he
had
a
wonderful
facility
for
verse
as
a
last
expedient
one
fell
back
upon
a
standing
column
a
collection
of
alleged
jests
which
had
been
set
up
years
ago
to
meet
the
worst
emergencies
it
was
however
considered
a
confession
of
weakness
and
a
degradation
to
use
this
column
we
had
also
in
our
drawer
a
book
of
american
witticisms
published
in
new
york
to
cut
one
out
preface
it
with
a
good
american
story
comes
to
hand
and
pin
it
on
a
slip
was
a
pleasing
variation
of
the
usual
mode
of
constructing
a
paragraph
gresham
and
i
each
had
our
favourite
method
personally
i
had
always
a
partiality
for
dealing
with
buffers
the
brakes
refused
to
act
and
the
train
struck
the
buffers
at
the
end
of
the
platform
invariably
suggested
that
if
elderly
gentlemen
would
abstain
from
loitering
on
railway
platforms
they
would
not
get
hurt
in
this
way
gresham
had
a
similar
liking
for
turns
the
performance
at
the
frivoli
music
hall
was
in
full
swing
when
the
scenery
was
noticed
to
be
on
fire
the
audience
got
a
turn
an
extra
turn
julian
eversleigh
to
whom
i
told
my
experiences
on
the
said
he
admired
the
spirit
with
which
i
entered
into
my
duties
he
said
moreover
that
i
had
a
future
before
me
not
only
as
a
journalist
but
as
a
writer
nor
indeed
could
i
help
seeing
for
myself
that
i
was
getting
on
i
was
making
a
fair
income
now
and
had
every
prospect
of
making
a
much
better
one
my
market
was
not
restricted
verses
articles
and
fiction
from
my
pen
were
being
accepted
with
moderate
regularity
by
many
of
the
minor
periodicals
my
scope
was
growing
distinctly
wider
i
found
too
that
my
work
seemed
to
meet
with
a
good
deal
more
success
when
i
sent
it
in
from
the
with
a
letter
to
the
editor
on
notepaper
altogether
my
five
weeks
on
the
were
invaluable
to
me
i
ought
to
have
paid
rather
than
have
taken
payment
for
working
on
the
column
by
the
time
fermin
came
back
from
scotland
to
turn
me
out
i
was
a
professional
i
had
learned
the
art
of
writing
against
time
i
had
learned
to
ignore
noise
which
for
a
writer
in
london
is
the
most
valuable
quality
of
all
every
day
at
the
i
had
had
to
turn
out
my
stuff
with
the
hum
of
the
strand
traffic
in
my
ears
varied
by
an
occasional
the
whistling
of
popular
songs
by
the
printers
whose
window
faced
ours
and
the
clatter
of
a
typewriter
in
the
next
room
often
i
had
to
turn
out
a
paragraph
or
a
verse
while
listening
and
making
appropriate
replies
to
some
other
member
of
the
staff
who
had
wandered
into
our
room
to
pass
the
time
of
day
or
read
out
a
bit
of
his
own
stuff
which
had
happened
to
please
him
particularly
all
this
gave
me
a
power
of
concentration
without
which
writing
is
difficult
in
this
city
of
noises
the
friendship
i
formed
with
gresham
too
besides
being
pleasant
was
of
infinite
service
to
me
he
knew
all
about
the
game
i
followed
his
advice
and
prospered
his
encouragement
was
as
valuable
as
his
advice
he
was
my
pilot
and
saw
me
at
great
trouble
to
himself
through
the
dangerous
waters
i
foresaw
that
the
future
held
out
positive
hope
that
my
marriage
with
margaret
would
become
possible
and
yet
pausing
in
the
midst
of
my
i
suffered
a
sense
of
revulsion
i
had
been
brought
up
to
believe
that
the
only
adjective
that
could
be
coupled
with
the
noun
journalism
was
precarious
was
i
not
as
gresham
would
have
said
solving
an
addition
sum
in
infantile
poultry
before
their
mother
the
feathered
denizen
of
the
farmyard
had
lured
them
from
their
shell
was
i
not
mistaking
a
flash
in
the
pan
for
a
genuine
success
these
thoughts
numbed
my
fingers
in
the
act
of
writing
to
margaret
instead
therefore
of
the
jubilant
letter
i
had
intended
to
send
her
i
wrote
one
of
quite
a
different
tone
i
mentioned
the
arduous
nature
of
my
work
i
referred
to
the
struggle
in
which
i
was
engaged
i
indicated
cleverly
that
i
was
a
man
of
extraordinary
courage
battling
with
fate
i
implied
that
i
made
just
enough
to
live
on
it
would
have
been
cruel
to
arouse
expectations
which
might
never
be
fulfilled
in
this
letter
accordingly
and
in
subsequent
letters
i
rather
went
to
the
opposite
extreme
out
of
pure
regard
for
margaret
i
painted
my
case
unnecessarily
black
considerations
of
a
similar
nature
prompted
me
to
keep
on
my
lodging
in
walpole
street
i
had
two
rooms
instead
of
one
but
they
were
furnished
severely
and
with
nothing
but
the
barest
necessaries
i
told
myself
through
it
all
that
i
loved
margaret
as
dearly
as
ever
yet
there
were
moments
and
they
seemed
to
come
more
frequently
as
the
days
went
on
when
i
found
myself
wondering
did
i
really
want
to
give
up
all
this
the
untidiness
the
scratch
meals
the
nights
with
julian
and
when
i
was
honest
i
answered
no
somehow
margaret
seemed
out
of
place
in
this
new
world
of
mine
chapter
new
year
eve
james
orlebar
cloyster
narrative
continued
the
morning
of
new
year
eve
was
a
memorable
one
for
me
my
first
novel
was
accepted
not
an
ambitious
volume
it
was
rather
short
and
the
plot
was
not
obtrusive
the
sporting
gentlemen
who
accepted
it
however
prodder
and
way
seemed
pleased
with
it
though
when
i
suggested
a
sum
in
cash
in
advance
of
royalties
they
displayed
a
most
embarrassing
coyness
and
also
as
events
turned
out
good
sense
i
carried
the
good
news
to
julian
whom
i
found
as
usual
asleep
in
his
hammock
i
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
calling
on
him
after
my
work
he
was
generally
sleepy
when
i
arrived
at
eleven
and
while
we
talked
i
used
to
make
his
breakfast
act
as
a
sort
of
early
lunch
for
myself
he
said
that
the
people
of
the
house
had
begun
by
trying
to
make
the
arrival
of
his
breakfast
coincide
with
the
completion
of
his
toilet
that
this
had
proved
so
irksome
that
they
had
struck
and
that
finally
it
had
been
agreed
on
both
sides
that
the
meal
should
be
put
in
his
room
at
eleven
whether
he
was
dressed
or
not
he
said
that
he
often
saw
his
breakfast
come
in
and
would
drowsily
determine
to
consume
it
hot
but
he
had
never
had
the
energy
to
do
so
once
indeed
he
had
mistaken
the
time
and
had
confidently
expected
that
the
morning
of
a
hot
breakfast
had
come
at
last
he
was
dressed
by
nine
and
had
sat
for
two
hours
gloating
over
the
prospect
of
steaming
coffee
and
frizzling
bacon
on
that
particular
morning
however
there
had
been
some
domestic
tragedy
the
firing
of
a
chimney
or
the
illness
of
a
cook
and
at
eleven
not
breakfast
but
an
apology
for
its
absence
had
been
brought
to
him
this
embittered
julian
he
gave
up
the
unequal
contest
and
he
has
frequently
confessed
to
me
that
cold
breakfast
is
an
acquired
yet
not
unpleasant
taste
he
woke
up
when
i
came
in
and
after
hearing
my
news
and
congratulating
me
began
to
open
the
letters
that
lay
on
the
table
at
his
side
one
of
the
envelopes
had
skeffington
trade
mark
stamped
upon
it
and
contained
a
and
a
sheet
closely
on
both
sides
half
a
second
jimmy
said
he
and
began
to
read
i
poured
myself
out
a
cup
of
cold
coffee
and
avoiding
the
bacon
and
eggs
which
lay
embalmed
in
frozen
grease
began
to
lunch
off
bread
and
marmalade
i
do
it
he
burst
out
when
he
had
finished
it
a
sweat
a
fearful
sweat
but
skeffington
have
written
urging
me
to
undertake
a
rather
original
advertising
scheme
they
very
pressing
and
they
enclosed
a
tenner
in
advance
they
want
me
to
do
them
a
tragedy
in
four
acts
i
sent
them
the
scenario
last
week
i
sketched
out
a
skeleton
plot
in
which
the
hero
is
addicted
to
a
strictly
moderate
use
of
sloe
gin
his
wife
adopts
every
conceivable
measure
to
wean
him
from
this
harmless
even
praiseworthy
indulgence
at
the
end
of
the
second
act
she
thinks
she
has
cured
him
he
has
promised
to
gratify
what
he
regards
as
merely
a
capricious
whim
on
her
part
will
give
yes
i
will
give
it
up
darling
george
she
falls
on
his
neck
over
her
shoulder
he
winks
at
the
audience
who
realise
that
there
is
more
to
come
curtain
in
act
the
husband
is
seen
sitting
alone
in
his
study
his
wife
has
gone
to
a
party
the
man
searches
in
a
cupboard
for
something
to
read
instead
of
a
novel
however
he
lights
on
a
bottle
of
skeffington
sloe
gin
instantly
the
old
overwhelming
craving
returns
he
hesitates
what
does
it
matter
she
will
never
know
he
gulps
down
glass
after
glass
he
sinks
into
an
intoxicated
stupor
his
wife
enters
curtain
again
act
the
draught
of
nectar
tasted
in
the
former
act
after
a
period
of
enforced
abstinence
has
produced
a
deadly
reaction
the
husband
who
previously
improved
his
health
his
temper
and
his
intellect
by
a
strictly
moderate
use
of
skeffington
sloe
gin
has
now
become
a
ghastly
dipsomaniac
his
wife
realising
too
late
the
awful
effect
of
her
idiotic
antagonism
to
skeffington
experiences
the
keenest
pangs
of
despair
she
drinks
laudanum
and
the
tragedy
is
complete
fine
i
said
finishing
the
coffee
in
a
deferential
postscript
said
julian
skeffington
suggest
an
alternative
ending
that
the
wife
should
drink
not
laudanum
but
sloe
gin
and
grow
under
its
benign
influence
resigned
to
the
fate
she
has
brought
on
her
husband
and
herself
resignation
gives
way
to
hope
she
devotes
her
life
to
the
care
of
the
inebriate
man
and
by
way
of
pathetic
retribution
she
lives
precisely
long
enough
to
nurse
him
back
to
sanity
which
finale
do
you
prefer
yours
i
said
thank
you
said
julian
considerably
gratified
so
do
i
terser
more
dramatic
and
altogether
a
better
advertisement
skeffington
make
jolly
good
sloe
gin
but
they
ca
arouse
pity
and
terror
yes
i
do
it
but
first
let
me
spend
the
tenner
i
taking
a
holiday
too
today
i
said
how
can
we
amuse
ourselves
julian
had
opened
the
last
of
his
letters
he
held
up
two
cards
tickets
for
covent
garden
ball
tonight
he
said
why
not
come
sure
to
be
a
good
one
i
should
like
to
i
said
thanks
julian
dropped
from
his
hammock
and
began
to
get
his
bath
ready
we
arranged
to
dine
early
at
the
maison
suisse
in
rupert
street
one
franc
plus
twopence
for
and
go
on
to
the
gallery
of
a
first
night
i
was
to
dress
for
covent
garden
at
julian
after
the
theatre
because
white
waistcoats
and
the
franc
did
go
well
together
when
i
dined
out
i
usually
went
to
the
maison
suisse
i
shall
never
have
the
chance
of
going
again
even
if
as
a
married
man
i
were
allowed
to
do
so
for
it
has
been
pulled
down
to
make
room
for
the
hicks
theatre
in
shaftesbury
avenue
when
i
did
not
dine
there
i
attended
a
quaint
survival
of
last
century
in
glasshouse
street
tall
boxes
wooden
tables
without
panelled
walls
an
excellent
menu
of
chops
steaks
fried
eggs
sausages
and
other
british
products
once
the
resort
of
bucks
and
macaronis
ford
i
found
frequented
by
a
strange
assortment
of
individuals
some
of
whom
resembled
bookmakers
touts
others
clerks
of
an
inexplicably
rustic
type
who
these
people
really
were
i
never
discovered
i
generally
have
supper
at
pepolo
said
julian
as
we
left
the
theatre
before
a
covent
garden
ball
shall
we
go
on
there
there
are
two
entrances
to
pepolo
restaurant
one
leading
to
the
ground
floor
the
other
to
the
brasserie
in
the
basement
i
liked
to
spend
an
hour
or
so
there
occasionally
smoking
and
watching
the
crowd
every
sixth
visit
on
an
average
i
would
happen
upon
somebody
interesting
among
the
ordinary
throng
of
medical
students
and
clerks
old
fellows
who
remembered
cremorne
a
mahogany
derelict
who
had
spent
his
youth
on
the
sea
when
liners
were
and
the
apprentices
terrorised
by
bullying
mates
and
the
rollers
of
the
bay
lay
howling
in
the
scuppers
and
prayed
to
be
thrown
overboard
he
told
me
of
one
voyage
on
which
the
malay
cook
went
mad
and
escaping
into
the
ratlines
shot
down
a
dozen
of
the
crew
before
he
himself
was
sniped
the
supper
tables
are
separated
from
the
brasserie
by
a
line
of
stucco
arches
and
as
it
was
now
a
quarter
to
twelve
the
place
was
full
at
a
first
glance
it
seemed
that
there
were
no
empty
supper
tables
presently
however
we
saw
one
laid
for
four
at
which
only
one
man
was
sitting
hullo
said
julian
there
malim
let
go
and
see
if
we
can
push
into
his
table
well
malim
how

cloyster
malim
had
a
lofty
expression
i
should
have
put
him
down
as
a
scholarly
recluse
his
first
words
upset
this
view
somewhat
coming
to
covent
garden
he
said
genially

kit

said
julian

said
malim
plenty
of
room
we
better
order
our
food
and
not
wait
for
her
we
took
our
places
and
looked
round
us
the
hum
of
conversation
was
persistent
it
rose
above
the
clatter
of
the
supper
tables
and
the
sudden
bursts
of
laughter
it
was
now
five
minutes
to
twelve
all
at
once
those
nearest
the
door
sprang
to
their
feet
a
girl
in
scarlet
and
black
had
come
in
ah

kit
at
last
said
malim
they
cheering
her
said
julian
as
he
spoke

tentative
murmur
of
a
cheer

caught
up
by
everyone

upon
chairs
and
tables
hullo
hullo
hullo

kit
reaching

kiddie
when

me

shy
she
was
laughing
like
a
child
she
leaned
across
the
table
put
her
arms
round
malim
neck
and
kissed
him
she
glanced
at
us
malim
smiled
quietly
but
said

continued
someone
had
told
me
that
the
glory
of
covent
garden
ball
had
departed
it
may
be
so
yet
the
floor
with
its
strange
conglomeration
of
artists
callow
university
men
shady
and
raucous
military
infants
had
an
atmosphere
of
more
than
meretricious
gaiety
the
close
of
an
old
year
and
the
birth
of
a
new
one
touch
the
toughest
the
band
was
working
away
with
a
strident
brassiness
which
filled
the
room
with
noise
the
women
dresses
were
a
shriek
of
colour
the
vulgarity
of
the
scene
was
so
immense
as
to
be
almost
admirable
it
was
certainly
interesting
watching
his
opportunity
julian
presently
drew
me
aside
into
the
malim
he
said
has
paid
you
a
great
compliment
really
i
said
rather
surprised
for
julian
acquaintance
had
done
nothing
more
to
my
knowledge
than
give
me
a
cigar
and
a
he
introduced
you
to
his
wife
very
good
of
him
i
sure
you
do
understand
you
see
kit
for
what
she
is
a
pretty
creature
bred
in
the
gutter
but
malim
well
he
in
the
foreign
office
and
is
secretary
to
sir
george
grant
then
what
in
heaven
name
i
cried
induced
him
to
marry
my
dear
jimmy
said
julian
adroitly
avoiding
the
arm
of
an
exuberant
lady
impersonating
winter
and
making
fair
practice
with
her
detachable
icicles
it
was
kit
or
no
one
just
consider
malim
position
which
was
that
of
thousands
of
other
men
of
his
type
they
are
the
cleverest
men
of
their
schools
they
are
the
intellectual
stars
of
their
varsities
i
was
at
oxford
with
malim
he
was
a
sort
of
tin
god
and
all
that
just
like
all
the
rest
of
them
they
get
what
is
looked
upon
as
a
splendid
appointment
under
government
they
come
to
london
hire
comfortable
chambers
or
a
flat
go
off
to
their
office
in
the
morning
leave
it
in
the
evening
and
are
given
a
salary
which
increases
by
regular
gradations
from
an
initial
two
hundred
a
year
say
that
a
man
begins
this
kind
of
work
at
what
are
his
matrimonial
prospects
his
office
work
occupies
his
entire
attention
the
idea
that
government
clerks
do
work
is
a
fiction
preserved
merely
for
the
writers
of
burlesque
from
the
moment
he
wakes
in
the
morning
until
dinner
his
leisure
extends
roughly
speaking
from
until
twelve
the
man
whom
i
am
discussing
and
of
whom
malim
is
a
type
is
as
i
have
already
proved
intellectual
he
has
therefore
ambitions
the
more
intellectual
he
is
the
more
he
loathes
the
stupid
routine
of
his
daily
task
thus
his
leisure
is
his
most
valuable
possession
there
are
books
he
wants
to
read
those
which
he
liked
in
the
days
previous
to
his
slavery
and
new
ones
which
he
sees
published
every
day
there
are
plays
he
wants
to
see
performed
and
there
are
subjects
on
which
he
would
like
to
write
would
give
his
left
hand
to
write
if
the
loss
of
that
limb
would
disqualify
him
for
his
post
where
is
his
social
chance
it
surely
exists
only
in
the
utter
abandonment
of
his
personal
projects
and
to
go
out
when
one
is
tied
to
the
clock
is
a
poor
sort
of
game
but
suppose
he
seek
the
society
of
what
friends
he
can
muster
in
london
is
he
made
much
of
fussed
over
not
a
bit
of
it
brainless
subalterns
ridiculous
midshipmen
have
in
the
eyes
of
the
girl
whom
he
has
come
to
see
a
reputation
that
he
can
never
win
they
in
the
service
they
so
dashing
they
so
charmingly
extravagant
they
so
tremendous
in
face
of
an
emergency
that
their
conversational
limitations
of
yes
and
no
are
hailed
as
brilliant
flights
of
genius
their
inane
anecdotes
their
pointless
observations
are
positively
courted
it
is
they
who
retire
to
the
conservatory
with
the
divine
violet
whose
face
is
like
the
venus
of
milo
whose
hair
one
hears
reaches
to
her
knees
whose
eyes
are
like
blue
saucers
and
whose
complexion
is
a
pink
poem
it
is
jane
the
stumpy
the
jane
who
wears
glasses
and
has
all
the
virtues
which
are
supposed
to
go
with
indigestion
big
hands
and
an
enormous
waist
jane
i
repeat
who
is
told
off
to
talk
to
a
man
like
malim
if
on
the
other
hand
he
and
his
fellows
refuse
to
put
on
evening
clothes
and
be
bored
to
death
of
an
evening
who
can
blame
them
if
they
deliberately
find
enough
satisfaction
for
their
needs
in
the
company
of
a
circle
of
men
friends
and
the
casual
pleasures
of
the
town
selfishness
is
the
last
epithet
with
which
their
behaviour
can
be
charged
unselfishness
has
been
their
curse
no
sane
person
would
of
his
own
accord
become
the
automaton
that
a
government
office
requires
pressure
on
the
part
of
relations
of
parents
has
been
brought
to
bear
on
them
the
steady
employment
the
graduated
income
the
pension
that
fatal
pension
has
been
danced
by
their
fathers
and
their
mothers
and
their
uncle
johns
before
their
eyes
appeals
have
been
made
to
them
on
filial
not
to
say
religious
grounds
threats
would
have
availed
nothing
but
appeals
downright
tearful
appeals
from
mamma
husky
appeals
from
papa
that
is
what
has
made
escape
impossible
a
huge
act
of
unselfishness
has
been
compelled
a
lifetime
of
reactionary
egotism
is
inevitable
and
legitimate
i
was
wrong
when
i
said
malim
was
typical
he
has
to
the
good
an
ingenuity
which
assists
naturally
in
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
self
and
circumstance
a
year
or
two
ago
chance
brought
him
in
contact
with
kit
they
struck
up
a
friendship
he
became
an
habitué
at
the
fried
fish
shop
in
tottenham
court
road
whenever
we
questioned
his
taste
he
said
that
a
physician
recommended
fish
as
a
tonic
for
the
brain
but
it
was
not
his
brain
that
took
malim
to
the
fried
fish
shop
it
was
his
heart
he
loved
kit
and
presently
he
married
her
one
would
have
said
this
was
an
impossible
step
misery
for
malim
people
his
friends
himself
and
afterwards
for
kit
but
nature
has
endowed
both
malim
and
kit
with
extraordinary
commonsense
he
kept
to
his
flat
she
kept
to
her
job
in
the
fried
fish
shop
only
instead
of
living
in
she
was
able
to
retire
after
her
day
work
to
a
little
house
which
he
hired
for
her
in
the
hampstead
road
her
work
for
which
she
is
eminently
fitted
keeps
her
out
of
mischief
his
flat
gives
the
impression
to
his
family
and
the
head
of
his
department
that
he
is
still
a
bachelor
thus
all
goes
well
i
often
read
in
the
police
reports
i
said
of
persons
who
lead
double
lives
and
i
much
interested
in
malim
and
kit
bore
down
upon
us
we
rose
it
the
march
past
observed
the
former
come
upstairs
kiddie
said
kit
give
me
your
arm
at
four
we
were
in
wellington
street
it
was
a
fine
mild
morning
and
in
the
queer
light
of
the
false
dawn
we
betook
ourselves
to
the
old
hummums
for
breakfast
other
couples
had
done
the
same
the
steps
of
the
hummums
facing
the
market
harboured
already
a
waiting
crowd
the
doors
were
to
be
opened
at
five
we
also
found
places
on
the
stone
steps
the
market
was
alive
with
porters
who
hailed
our
appearance
with
every
profession
of
delight
early
hours
would
seem
to
lend
a
certain
acidity
to
their
badinage
a
more
personal
note
crept
into
their
facetious
comments
two
guardsmen
on
the
top
step
suddenly
displayed
in
return
a
very
creditable
gift
of
repartee
covent
garden
market
was
delighted
it
felt
the
stern
joy
which
warriors
feel
with
foemen
worthy
of
their
steel
it
suspended
its
juggling
feats
with
vegetable
baskets
and
devoted
itself
exclusively
to
the
task
of
silencing
our
guns
porters
costers
and
the
of
the
streets
crowded
in
a
semicircle
around
us
just
then
it
was
borne
in
on
us
how
small
our
number
was
a
solid
phalanx
of
the
toughest
customers
in
london
faced
us
behind
this
semicircle
a
line
of
carts
had
been
drawn
up
unseen
enemies
from
behind
this
laager
now
began
to
amuse
themselves
by
bombarding
us
with
the
product
of
the
market
garden
tomatoes
cauliflowers
and
potatoes
came
hurtling
into
our
midst
i
saw
julian
consulting
his
watch
five
minutes
more
he
said
i
had
noticed
some
minutes
back
that
the
ardour
of
the
attack
seemed
to
centre
round
one
man
in
particular
a
short
very
burly
man
in
a
costume
that
seemed
somehow
vaguely
nautical
his
face
wore
the
expression
of
one
cheerfully
conscious
of
being
well
on
the
road
to
intoxication
he
was
the
ringleader
it
was
he
who
threw
the
largest
cabbage
the
most
tomato
i
do
suppose
he
had
ever
enjoyed
himself
so
much
in
his
life
he
was
standing
now
on
a
cart
full
of
potatoes
and
firing
them
in
with
tremendous
force
kit
saw
him
too
why
there
that
blackguard
tom
she
cried
she
had
been
told
to
sit
down
behind
malim
for
safety
before
anyone
could
stop
her
or
had
guessed
her
intention
she
had
pushed
her
way
through
us
and
stepped
out
into
the
road
it
was
so
unexpected
that
there
was
an
involuntary
lull
in
the
proceedings
tom
she
pointed
an
accusing
finger
at
the
man
who
gaped
beerily
tom
who
pinched
farver
best
trousers
and
popped
them
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
a
moment
before
and
tom
had
been
the
pet
of
the
market
the
energetic
leader
the
champion
now
he
was
a
thing
of
derision
his
friends
took
up
the
question
keen
anxiety
was
expressed
on
all
sides
as
to
the
fate
of
father
trousers
he
was
requested
to
be
a
man
and
speak
up
the
uproar
died
away
as
it
was
seen
that
kit
had
not
yet
finished
cheese
it
some
of
yer
shouted
a
voice
the
lady
wants
to
orsk
him
somefin
else
tom
said
kit
who
was
sent
with
tuppence
to
buy
and
spent
it
on
beer
the
question
was
well
received
by
the
audience
tom
was
beaten
a
potato
vast
and
nobbly
fell
from
his
palsied
hand
he
was
speechless
then
he
began
to
stammer
just
you
stop
it
tom
shouted
kit
triumphantly
just
you
stop
it
you
stop
it
she
turned
towards
us
on
the
steps
and
taking
us
all
into
her
confidence
added
a
nice
thing
to
for
a
bruvver
anyway
then
she
rejoined
malim
amid
peals
of
laughter
from
both
armies
it
was
a
homeric
incident
only
a
attempt
was
made
to
renew
the
attack
and
when
the
door
of
the
hummums
at
last
opened
malim
observed
to
julian
and
me
as
we
squashed
our
way
in
that
if
a
man
wife
relations
were
always
as
opportune
as
kit
the
greatest
objection
to
them
would
be
removed
chapter
i
meet
the
rev
john
hatton
james
orlebar
cloyster
narrative
continued
i
saw
a
great
deal
of
malim
after
that
he
and
julian
became
my
two
chief
mainstays
when
i
felt
in
need
of
society
malim
was
a
man
of
delicate
literary
skill
a
genuine
lover
of
books
a
severe
critic
of
modern
fiction
our
tastes
were
in
the
main
identical
though
it
was
always
a
blow
to
me
that
he
could
see
nothing
humorous
in
george
ade
whose
fables
i
knew
nearly
by
heart
the
more
robust
type
of
humour
left
him
cold
in
all
other
respects
we
agreed
there
is
a
fascination
in
a
man
with
a
secret
it
gave
me
a
pleasant
feeling
of
being
behind
the
scenes
to
watch
malim
sitting
in
his
armchair
the
essence
of
everything
that
was
conventional
and
respectable
with
eton
and
oxford
written
all
over
him
and
to
think
that
he
was
married
all
the
while
to
an
employee
in
a
tottenham
court
road
shop
kit
never
appeared
in
the
flat
but
malim
went
nearly
every
evening
to
the
little
villa
sometimes
he
took
julian
and
myself
more
often
myself
alone
julian
being
ever
disinclined
to
move
far
from
his
hammock
the
more
i
saw
of
kit
the
more
thoroughly
i
realized
how
eminently
fitted
she
was
to
be
malim
wife
it
was
a
union
of
opposites
except
for
the
type
of
fiction
provided
by
penny
libraries
of
powerful
stories
kit
had
probably
not
read
more
than
half
a
dozen
books
in
her
life
grimm
fairy
stories
she
recollected
dimly
and
she
betrayed
a
surprising
acquaintance
with
at
least
three
of
novels
i
fancy
that
malim
appeared
to
her
as
a
sort
of
combination
of
fairy
prince
and
ouida
guardsman
he
exhibited
the
oxford
manner
at
times
rather
noticeably
kit
loved
it
till
i
saw
them
together
i
had
thought
kit
accent
and
her
incessant
mangling
of
the
king
english
would
have
jarred
upon
malim
but
i
soon
found
that
i
was
wrong
he
did
not
appear
to
notice
i
learned
from
kit
in
the
course
of
my
first
visit
to
the
villa
some
further
particulars
respecting
her
brother
tom
the
of
covent
garden
market
thomas
blake
it
seemed
was
the
proprietor
and
skipper
of
a
barge
a
pleasant
enough
fellow
when
sober
but
too
much
given
to
what
kit
described
as
his
drop
he
had
apparently
left
home
under
something
of
a
cloud
though
whether
this
had
anything
to
do
with
father
trousers
i
never
knew
kit
said
she
had
not
seen
him
for
some
years
though
each
had
known
the
other
address
it
seemed
that
the
blake
family
were
not
great
correspondents
have
you
ever
met
john
hatton
asked
malim
one
night
after
dinner
at
his
flat
john
hatton
i
answered
no
who
is
he
a
parson
a
very
good
fellow
you
ought
to
know
him
he
a
man
with
a
number
of
widely
different
interests
we
were
at
trinity
together
he
jumps
from
one
thing
to
another
but
he
frightfully
keen
about
whatever
he
does
someone
was
saying
that
he
was
running
a
boys
club
in
the
thickest
part
of
lambeth
there
might
be
copy
in
it
i
said
or
ideas
for
advertisements
for
julian
said
malim
anyway
introduce
you
to
him
have
you
ever
been
in
the
barrel
what
the
barrel
the
barrel
is
a
club
it
gets
the
name
from
the
fact
that
it
the
only
club
in
england
that
allows
and
indeed
urges
its
members
to
sit
on
a
barrel
john
hatton
is
sometimes
to
be
found
there
come
round
to
it
tomorrow
night
all
right
i
replied
where
is
it
a
hundred
and
york
street
covent
garden
first
floor
very
well
i
said
i
meet
you
there
at
twelve
i
come
sooner
because
i
got
a
story
to
write
twelve
had
just
struck
when
i
walked
up
york
street
looking
for
no
the
house
was
brilliantly
lighted
on
the
first
floor
the
street
door
opened
on
to
a
staircase
and
as
i
mounted
it
the
sound
of
a
piano
and
a
singing
voice
reached
me
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
caught
sight
of
a
waiter
loaded
with
glasses
i
called
to
him
cloyster
sir
yessir
i
find
out
whether
malim
can
see
you
sir
malim
came
out
to
me
hatton
not
here
he
said
but
come
in
there
a
smoking
concert
going
on
he
took
me
into
the
room
the
windows
of
which
i
had
seen
from
the
street
there
was
a
burst
of
cheering
as
we
entered
the
room
the
song
was
finished
and
there
was
a
movement
among
the
audience
it
the
interval
said
malim
men
surged
out
of
the
packed
front
room
into
the
passage
and
then
into
a
sort
of
bar
parlour
malim
and
i
also
made
our
way
there
that
the
fetish
of
the
club
said
malim
pointing
to
a
barrel
standing
on
end
and
i
introduce
you
to
the
man
who
is
sitting
on
it
he
little
michael
the
musical
critic
they
once
put
on
an
operetta
of
his
at
the
court
it
ran
about
two
nights
but
he
reckons
all
the
events
of
the
world
from
the
date
of
its
production
cloyster
mr
michael
the
musician
hopped
down
from
the
barrel
and
shook
hands
he
was
a
dapper
little
person
and
had
a
trick
of
punctuating
every
sentence
with
a
snigger
he
said
genially
is
this
your
first
visit
i
said
it
was
then
sit
on
the
barrel
we
are
the
only
club
in
london
who
can
offer
you
the
privilege
accordingly
i
sat
on
the
barrel
and
through
a
murmur
of
applause
i
could
hear
michael
telling
someone
that
he
first
seen
that
barrel
five
years
before
his
operetta
came
out
at
the
court
at
that
moment
a
venerable
figure
strode
with
dignity
into
the
bar
maundrell
said
malim
to
me
the
last
of
the
old
bohemians
an
old
actor
always
wears
the
steeple
hat
and
a
long
coat
with
skirts
the
survivor
of
the
days
of
kean
uttered
a
bellow
for
that
barrel
he
said
reminds
me
of
buckstone
days
at
the
haymarket
after
the
performance
we
used
to
meet
at
the
café
de
a
few
yards
from
the
theatre
our
secret
society
sat
there
what
was
the
society
called
mr
maundrell
asked
a
new
member
with
unusual
intrepidity
its
name
replied
the
actor
simply
i
shall
not
divulge
it
was
not
however
altogether
unconnected
with
the
pink
men
of
the
blue
mountains
we
used
to
sit
we
who
were
initiated
in
a
circle
we
met
to
discuss
the
business
of
the
society
oh
we
were
the
observed
of
all
observers
i
can
assure
you
our
society
was
extensive
it
had
its
offshoots
in
foreign
lands
well
we
at
these
meetings
used
to
sit
round
a
barrel
a
great
big
barrel
which
had
a
hole
in
the
top
the
barrel
was
not
merely
an
ornament
for
through
the
hole
in
the
top
we
threw
any
scraps
and
odds
and
ends
we
did
not
want
bits
of
tobacco
bread
marrow
bones
the
dregs
of
our
glasses
anything
and
everything
went
into
the
barrel
and
so
it
happened
as
the
barrel
became
fuller
and
fuller
strange
animals
made
their
appearance
animals
of
peculiar
shape
and
form
crawled
out
of
the
barrel
and
would
attempt
to
escape
across
the
floor
but
we
were
on
their
tracks
we
saw
them
we
headed
them
off
with
our
sticks
and
we
chased
them
back
again
to
the
place
where
they
had
been
born
and
bred
we
poked
them
in
sir
with
our
sticks
maundrell
emitted
a
placid
chuckle
at
this
reminiscence
a
good
many
members
of
this
club
whispered
malim
to
me
would
have
gone
back
into
that
barrel
a
bell
sounded
that
for
the
second
part
to
begin
said
malim
we
herded
back
along
the
passage
a
voice
cried
be
seated
please
gentlemen
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
was
a
table
for
the
chairman
and
the
committee
and
to
the
left
stood
a
piano
everyone
had
now
sat
down
except
the
chairman
who
was
apparently
not
in
the
room
there
was
a
pause
then
a
man
from
the
audience
whooped
sharply
and
clambered
over
the
table
and
into
the
place
of
the
chairman
he
tapped
twice
with
the
mallet
get
out
of
that
chair
yelled
various
voices
gentlemen
said
the
man
in
the
chair
a
howl
of
execration
went
up
and
simultaneously
the
door
was
flung
open
a
double
file
of
druids
came
chanting
into
the
room
the
druids
carried
in
with
them
a
small
portable
tree
which
they
proceeded
to
set
upright
the
chant
now
became
extremely
topical
each
druid
sang
a
verse
in
turn
while
his
fellow
druids
danced
a
stately
measure
round
the
tree
as
the
verse
was
being
sung
an
imitation
granite
altar
was
hastily
erected
the
man
in
the
chair
who
had
so
far
smoked
a
cigarette
in
silence
now
tapped
again
with
his
mallet
gentlemen
he
observed
the
druids
ended
their
song
abruptly
and
made
a
dash
at
the
occupant
of
the
chair
the
audience
stood
up
a
victim
for
our
ancient
rites
screamed
the
druids
falling
upon
the
man
and
dragging
him
towards
the
property
altar
the
victim
showed
every
sign
of
objection
to
early
english
rites
but
he
was
dislodged
and
after
being
dragged
struggling
across
the
table
subsided
quickly
on
the
floor
the
mob
surged
about
and
around
him
he
was
hidden
from
view
his
position
however
could
be
located
by
a
series
of
piercing
shrieks
the
door
again
opened
maundrell
the
real
chairman
of
the
evening
stood
on
the
threshold
chair
was
now
the
word
that
arose
on
every
side
and
at
this
signal
the
druids
disappeared
at
a
trot
past
the
impassive
maundrell
their
victim
followed
them
but
before
he
did
so
he
picked
up
his
trousers
which
were
lying
on
the
carpet
all
the
time
this
scene
had
been
going
on
i
fancied
i
recognised
the
man
in
the
chair
in
a
flash
i
remembered
it
was
dawkins
who
had
coached
first
trinity
and
whom
i
as
a
visitor
once
at
the
training
dinner
had
last
seen
going
through
the
ancient
and
honourable
process
of
at
the
hands
of
his
boat
come
on
said
malim
godfrey
lane
going
to
sing
a
patriotic
song
they
let
him
do
it
we
go
down
to
the
temple
and
find
john
hatton
we
left
the
barrel
at
about
one
it
was
a
typical
london
late
autumn
night
quiet
with
the
peace
of
a
humming
top
warm
with
the
heat
generated
from
mellow
asphalt
and
resinous
we
turned
from
bedford
street
eastwards
along
the
strand
between
one
and
two
the
strand
is
as
empty
as
it
ever
is
it
is
given
over
to
lurchers
and
policemen
fleet
street
reproduces
for
this
one
hour
the
sahara
when
i
knock
at
the
temple
gate
late
at
night
said
malim
and
am
admitted
by
the
night
porter
i
always
feel
a
pleasantly
archaic
touch
i
agreed
with
him
the
process
seemed
a
quaint
admixture
of
an
oxford
or
cambridge
college
gottingen
and
a
feudal
keep
and
after
the
gate
had
been
closed
behind
one
it
was
difficult
to
realise
that
within
a
few
yards
of
an
academic
system
of
lawns
and
buildings
full
of
living
traditions
and
associations
which
wainscoting
and
winding
stairs
engender
lay
the
modern
world
its
american
invaders
its
new
humour
its
women
clubs
its
long
firms
its
musical
comedies
its
park
lane
and
its
strand
with
the
hub
of
the
universe
projecting
from
the
roadway

englishmen
to
gloat
over
and
for
foreigners

harcourt
buildings
is
emblazoned
with
many
names
including
that
of
the
rev
john
hatton
the
oak
was
not
sported
and
our
rap
at
the
inner
door
was
immediately
answered
by
a
shout
of
come
in
as
we
opened
it
we
heard
a
peculiar
whirring
sound
road
skates
said
hatton
gracefully
circling
the
table
and
then
coming
to
a
standstill
i
was
introduced
i
very
glad
to
see
you
both
he
said
the
two
other
men
i
share
these
rooms
with
have
gone
away
so
i
killing
time
by
training
for
my
tour
abroad
it
trying
for
ankles
could
you
go
downstairs
on
them
said
malim
certainly
he
replied
i
do
so
now
and
when
we
down
have
a
little
practice
in
the
open
whereupon
he
skated
to
the
landing
scrambled
down
the
stairs
sped
up
middle
temple
lane
and
called
the
porter
to
let
us
out
into
fleet
street
he
struck
me
as
a
man
who
differed
in
some
respects
from
the
popular
conception
of
a
curate
i
race
you
to
ludgate
circus
and
back
said
the
clergyman
you
too
fast
said
malim
it
must
be
a
handicap
we
might
do
it
level
in
a
cab
said
i
for
i
saw
a
hansom
crawling
towards
us
done
said
the
rev
john
hatton
done
for
i
climbed
into
the
hansom
and
malim
about
to
follow
me
found
that
a
constable
to
whom
the
soil
of
the
city
had
given
spontaneous
birth
was
standing
at
his
shoulder
wot
the
game
inquired
the
officer
with
tender
solicitude
a
fine
night
perkins
remarked
hatton
a
fine
morning
beggin
your
pardon
sir
said
the
policeman
facetiously
he
seemed
to
be
an
acquaintance
of
the
skater
reliability
trials
continued
hatton
be
good
enough
to
start
us
perkins
very
good
sir
said
perkins
drive
to
ludgate
circus
and
back
and
beat
the
gentleman
on
the
skates
said
malim
to
our
driver
who
was
taking
the
race
as
though
he
assisted
at
such
events
in
the
course
of
his
daily
duty
hi
shall
say
you
ready
horf
we
shall
have
perkins
applying
to
the
jockey
club
for
ernest
willoughby
job
whispered
malim
are
you
ready
horf
hatton
was
first
off
the
mark
he
raced
down
the
incline
to
the
circus
at
a
tremendous
speed
he
was
just
in
sight
as
he
swung
laboriously
round
and
headed
for
home
but
meeting
him
on
our
outward
journey
we
noticed
that
the
upward
slope
was
distressing
him
shall
we
do
it
we
asked
yessir
said
our
driver
and
now
we
too
were
on
the
up
grade
we
went
up
the
hill
at
a
gallop
were
equal
with
hatton
at
fetter
lane
and
reached
the
temple
gate
yards
to
the
good
the
ancient
driver
of
a
had
been
the
witness
of
the
finish
he
gazed
with
displeasure
upon
us
this
a
nice
use
ter
put
fleet
street
to
i
do
think
he
said
coldly
this
sarcastic
rebuke
rather
damped
us
and
after
hatton
had
paid
malim
his
and
had
invited
me
to
visit
him
we
departed
queer
chap
hatton
said
malim
as
we
walked
up
the
strand
i
was
to
discover
at
no
distant
date
that
he
was
distinctly
a
man
i
have
met
a
good
many
clergymen
in
my
time
but
i
have
never
come
across
one
quite
like
the
rev
john
hatton
chapter
julian
learns
my
secret
james
orlebar
cloyster
narrative
continued
a
difficulty
in
the
life
of
a
literary
man
in
london
is
the
question
of
getting
systematic
exercise
at
school
and
college
i
had
been
accustomed
to
play
games
every
day
and
now
i
felt
the
change
acutely
it
was
through
this
that
i
first
became
really
intimate
with
john
hatton
and
incidentally
with
sidney
price
of
the
moon
assurance
company
i
happened
to
mention
my
trouble
one
night
in
hatton
rooms
i
had
been
there
frequently
since
my
first
visit
none
of
my
waistcoats
fit
i
remarked
my
dear
fellow
said
hatton
i
give
you
exercise
and
to
spare
that
is
to
say
if
you
can
box
i
not
a
champion
i
said
but
i
fond
of
it
i
should
mind
taking
up
boxing
again
there
nothing
like
it
for
exercise
quite
right
james
he
replied
and
exercise
as
i
often
tell
my
boys
is
essential
what
boys
i
asked
my
club
boys
said
hatton
they
belong
to
the
most
dingy
quarter
of
the
whole
of
london
south
lambeth
they
are
not
hooligans
they
are
not
so
interesting
as
that
they
represent
the
class
of
youth
that
is
a
stratum
or
two
above
hooliganism
frightful
weeds
they
lack
the
robust
animalism
of
the
class
below
them
and
they
lack
the
intelligence
of
the
class
above
them
the
fellows
at
my
club
are
mostly
mechanics
and
office
boys
they
have
nothing
approaching
a
sense
of
humour
or
the
instinct
of
sport
not
very
encouraging
i
said
nor
picturesque
said
hatton
and
that
is
why
they
been
so
neglected
there
is
romance
in
an
hooligan
it
interests
people
to
reform
him
but
to
the
outsider
my
boys
are
dull
i
find
them
so
but
then
i
know
them
boxing
lessons
are
just
what
they
want
in
fact
i
was
telling
sidney
price
an
insurance
clerk
who
lives
in
lambeth
and
helps
me
at
the
club
only
yesterday
how
much
i
wished
we
could
teach
them
to
use
the
gloves
i
take
it
on
then
hatton
if
you
like
i
said
it
ought
to
keep
me
in
form
i
found
that
it
did
i
ceased
to
be
aware
of
my
liver
that
winter
i
was
able
to
work
to
good
purpose
and
the
result
was
that
i
arrived
it
dawned
upon
me
at
last
that
the
precarious
idea
was
played
out
one
could
see
too
plainly
the
white
sheet
and
phosphorus
and
i
was
happy
happier
perhaps
than
i
had
ever
hoped
to
be
happier
in
a
sense
than
i
can
hope
to
be
again
i
had
congenial
work
and
what
is
more
i
had
congenial
friends
what
friends
they
were
julian
i
seem
to
see
him
now
sprawling
in
his
hammock
sucking
his
pipe
planning
an
advertisement
or
propounding
some
whimsical
theory
of
life
and
in
his
eyes
he
bears
the
pain
of
one
whose
love
and
life
are
spoilt
julian
no
longer
my
friend
kit
and
malim
what
evenings
are
suggested
by
those
names
evenings
alone
with
malim
at
his
flat
in
vernon
place
an
unimpeachable
dinner
a
hand
at
picquet
midnight
talk
with
the
blue
smoke
wreathing
round
our
heads
well
malim
and
i
are
unlikely
to
meet
again
in
vernon
place
nor
shall
we
foregather
at
the
little
house
in
the
hampstead
road
the
house
which
kit
enveloped
in
an
inimitable
air
of
domesticity
her
past
had
not
been
unconnected
with
the
minor
stage
she
could
play
on
the
piano
from
ear
and
sing
the
songs
of
the
street
with
a
charming
cockney
twang
but
there
was
nothing
of
the
stage
about
her
now
she
was
born
for
domesticity
and
as
the
wife
of
malim
she
wished
to
forget
all
that
had
gone
before
she
even
hesitated
to
give
us
her
wonderful
imitations
of
the
customers
at
the
fried
fish
shop
because
in
her
heart
she
did
not
think
such
impersonations
altogether
suitable
for
a
respectable
married
woman
it
was
malim
who
got
me
elected
to
the
barrel
club
i
take
it
that
i
shall
pay
few
more
visits
there
i
have
mentioned
at
this
point
the
love
of
my
old
friends
who
made
my
first
years
in
london
a
period
of
happiness
since
it
was
in
this
month
of
april
that
i
had
a
momentous
conversation
with
julian
about
margaret
he
had
come
to
walpole
street
to
use
my
typewriter
and
seemed
amazed
to
find
that
i
was
still
living
in
much
the
same
style
as
i
had
always
done
let
me
see
he
said
how
long
is
it
since
i
was
here
last
you
came
some
time
before
christmas
ah
yes
he
said
reminiscently
i
was
doing
a
lot
of
travelling
just
then
and
he
added
thoughtfully
what
a
curious
fellow
you
are
jimmy
here
are
you
making
he
glanced
at
me
oh
say
a
thousand
a
year
fifteen
hundred
a
year
and
you
live
in
precisely
the
same
shoddy
surroundings
as
you
did
when
your
manuscripts
were
responsible
for
an
extra
size
in
baskets
i
was
surprised
to
hear
that
you
were
still
in
walpole
street
i
supposed
that
at
any
rate
you
had
taken
the
whole
house
his
eyes
raked
the
little
from
the
sham
marble
mantelpiece
to
the
bamboo
cabinet
i
surveyed
it
too
and
suddenly
it
did
seem
unnecessarily
wretched
and
depressing
julian
looked
at
me
curiously
there
some
mystery
here
he
said
do
be
an
ass
julian
i
replied
weakly
it
no
good
denying
it
he
retorted
there
some
mystery
you
a
materialist
you
do
live
like
this
from
choice
if
you
were
to
follow
your
own
inclinations
you
do
things
in
the
best
style
you
could
run
to
you
be
in
jermyn
street
you
have
your
man
a
cottage
in
surrey
you
entertain
go
out
a
good
deal
you
certainly
give
up
these
dingy
quarters
my
friendship
for
you
deplores
a
mammoth
skeleton
in
your
cupboard
james
my
study
of
advertising
tells
me
that
this
paltry
existence
of
yours
does
not
adequately
push
your
name
before
the
public
you
losing
money
you
stop
julian
i
exclaimed
he
continued
stop
confound
you
stop
i
tell
you
come
he
said
laughing
i
must
force
your
confidence
but
i
help
feeling
it
odd
when
i
came
to
london
i
said
firmly
i
was
most
desperately
in
love
i
was
to
make
a
fortune
incidentally
my
name
marry
and
live
happily
ever
after
there
seemed
last
year
nothing
complex
about
that
programme
it
seemed
almost
too
simple
i
even
like
a
fool
thought
to
add
an
extra
touch
of
piquancy
to
it
by
endeavouring
to
be
a
bohemian
i
then
discovered
that
what
i
was
attempting
was
not
so
simple
as
i
had
imagined
to
begin
with
bohemians
diffuse
their
brains
in
every
direction
except
that
where
comes
from
i
found
too
that
unless
one
earns
one
has
to
sprint
very
fast
to
the
workhouse
door
to
prevent
oneself
starving
before
one
gets
there
so
i
dropped
bohemia
and
i
dropped
many
other
pleasant
fictions
as
well
i
took
to
examining
pavements
saw
how
hard
they
were
had
a
look
at
the
gutters
and
saw
how
broad
they
were
i
noticed
the
accumulation
of
dirt
on
the
house
fronts
the
actual
proportions
of
industrial
buildings
i
observed
closely
the
price
of
food
clothes
and
roofs
you
became
a
realist
yes
i
read
a
good
deal
of
gissing
about
then
and
it
scared
me
i
pitied
myself
and
after
that
came
pity
for
the
girl
i
loved
i
swore
that
i
would
never
let
her
come
to
my
side
in
the
ring
where
the
monster
poverty
and
i
were
fighting
if
you
been
there
you
been
in
hell
and
if
you
come
out
with
your
soul
alive
you
ca
tell
other
people
what
it
felt
like
they
could
understand
julian
nodded
i
understand
you
know
he
said
gravely
yes
you
been
there
i
said
well
you
seen
that
my
little
with
the
monster
was
short
and
sharp
it
was
one
of
the
affairs
our
pace
was
too
fast
for
that
we
went
at
it
both
hands
fighting
all
the
time
i
was
going
for
the
in
the
first
round
not
your
method
julian
no
said
julian
it
not
my
method
i
treat
the
monster
rather
as
a
wild
animal
than
as
a
hooligan
and
hearing
that
wild
animals
wo
do
more
than
sniff
at
you
if
you
lie
perfectly
still
i
adopted
that
ruse
towards
him
to
save
myself
the
trouble
of
a
conflict
but
the
effect
of
lying
perfectly
still
was
that
i
used
to
fall
asleep
and
that
works
satisfactorily
julian
i
said
i
detect
a
touch
of
envy
in
your
voice
you
try
to
keep
it
out
but
you
ca
wait
a
bit
though
i
have
finished
as
you
know
i
had
the
monster
down
in
less
than
no
time
i
said
to
myself
won
i
write
to
margaret
and
tell
her
so
do
you
know
i
had
actually
begun
to
write
the
letter
when
another
thought
struck
me
one
that
started
me
sweating
and
shaking
monster
i
said
again
to
myself
monster
is
devilish
cunning
perhaps
only
shamming
it
looks
as
if
he
were
beaten
suppose
it
only
a
feint
to
get
me
off
my
guard
suppose
he
just
wants
me
to
take
my
eyes
off
him
so
that
he
may
get
at
me
again
as
soon
as
i
begun
to
look
for
a
comfortable
chair
and
a
mantelpiece
to
rest
my
feet
on
i
told
myself
that
i
would
risk
bringing
margaret
over
i
did
dare
chance
her
being
with
me
if
ever
i
had
to
go
back
into
the
ring
so
i
kept
jumping
and
stamping
on
the
monster
the
referee
had
given
me
the
fight
and
had
gone
away
and
with
no
one
to
stop
me
i
kicked
the
life
out
of
him
no
you
did
interrupted
julian
excuse
me
i
sure
you
did
i
often
wake
up
and
hear
him
prowling
about
yes
but
there
a
separate
monster
set
apart
for
each
of
us
fate
who
arranges
the
programme
and
by
stress
of
business
fate
postpones
many
contests
so
late
that
before
they
can
take
place
the
man
has
died
those
who
die
before
their
fight
comes
on
are
called
rich
men
to
return
however
to
my
own
monster
i
was
at
last
convinced
that
he
was
dead
a
thousand
times
how
long
have
you
had
this
conviction
asked
julian
the
absolute
certainty
that
my
monster
has
ceased
to
exist
came
to
me
this
morning
whilst
i
brushed
my
hair
ah
said
julian
and
now
i
suppose
you
really
will
write
to
miss
margaret
he
paused
goodwin
to
miss
margaret
goodwin
he
repeated
look
here
julian
i
said
irritably
it
no
use
your
repeating
every
observation
i
make
as
though
you
were
massa
johnson
on
margate
sands
what
the
matter
i
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
i
confessed
julian
i
said
i
ca
write
to
her
you
need
neither
say
that
a
blackguard
nor
that
you
sorry
for
us
both
at
this
present
moment
i
no
more
affection
for
margaret
than
i
have
for
this
chair
when
precisely
i
left
off
caring
for
her
i
do
know
why
i
ever
thought
i
loved
her
i
do
know
either
but
ever
since
i
came
to
london
all
the
love
i
did
have
for
her
has
been
ebbing
away
every
day
had
you
met
many
people
before
you
met
her
asked
julian
slowly
no
one
that
counted
not
a
woman
that
counted
that
to
say
i
am
shy
with
women
i
can
talk
to
them
in
a
sort
of
way
but
i
never
seem
able
to
get
intimate
margaret
was
different
she
saved
my
life
and
we
spent
the
summer
in
guernsey
together
and
you
seriously
expected
not
to
fall
in
love
julian
laughed
my
dear
jimmy
you
ought
to
write
a
psychological
novel
possibly
but
in
the
meantime
what
am
i
to
do
julian
stood
up
she
in
love
with
you
i
suppose
yes
he
stood
looking
at
me
well
ca
you
speak
i
said
he
turned
away
shrugging
his
shoulders
one
got
one
own
right
and
one
own
wrong
he
grumbled
lighting
his
pipe
i
know
what
you
thinking
i
said
he
would
not
look
at
me
you
thinking
i
went
on
what
a
cad
i
am
not
to
have
written
that
letter
i
sat
down
resting
my
head
on
my
hands
after
all
love
and
liberty
they
both
very
sweet
i
thinking
said
julian
watching
the
smoke
from
his
pipe
abstractedly
that
you
will
probably
write
tonight
and
i
think
i
know
how
you
feeling
julian
i
said
must
it
be
tonight
why
the
letter
shall
go
but
must
it
be
tonight
julian
hesitated
no
he
said
but
you
made
up
your
mind
so
why
put
off
the
inevitable
i
ca
i
exclaimed
oh
i
really
ca
i
must
have
my
freedom
a
little
longer
you
must
give
it
up
some
day
it
be
all
the
harder
when
you
got
to
face
it
i
do
mind
that
a
little
more
freedom
just
a
little
and
then
tell
her
to
come
to
me
he
smoked
in
silence
surely
i
said
this
little
more
freedom
that
i
ask
is
a
small
thing
compared
with
the
sacrifice
i
have
promised
to
make
you
wo
let
her
know
it
a
sacrifice
of
course
not
she
shall
think
that
i
love
her
as
i
used
to
yes
you
ought
to
do
that
he
said
softly
poor
devil
he
added
am
i
too
selfish
i
asked
he
got
up
to
go
no
he
said
to
my
mind
you
entitled
to
a
breathing
space
before
you
give
up
all
that
you
love
best
but
a
risk
of
what
of
her
finding
out
by
some
other
means
than
yourself
and
before
your
letter
comes
that
the
letter
should
have
been
written
earlier
do
you
sign
all
your
stuff
with
your
own
name
yes
well
then
she
bound
to
see
how
you
getting
on
she
see
your
name
in
the
magazines
in
newspapers
and
in
books
she
know
you
do
write
for
nothing
and
she
make
calculations
i
was
staggered
you
mean
i
said
why
it
will
occur
to
her
before
long
that
your
statement
of
your
income
does
square
with
the
rest
of
the
evidence
and
she
wonder
why
you
pose
as
a
pauper
when
you
really
raking
in
the
money
with
both
hands
she
think
it
over
and
then
she
see
it
all
i
see
i
said
dully
well
you
taken
my
last
holiday
from
me
i
write
to
her
tonight
telling
her
the
truth
i
should
necessarily
wait
a
week
or
two
you
may
quite
possibly
hit
on
some
way
out
of
the
difficulty
i
bound
to
say
though
i
ca
see
one
myself
at
the
moment
nor
can
i
i
said
chapter
tom
blake
again
james
orlebar
cloyster
narrative
continued
hatton
club
boys
took
kindly
to
my
course
of
instruction
for
a
couple
of
months
indeed
it
seemed
that
another
golden
age
of
the
noble
art
was
approaching
and
that
the
rejuvenation
of
boxing
would
occur
beginning
at
carnation
hall
lambeth
then
the
thing
collapsed
like
a
punctured
tyre
at
first
of
course
they
fought
a
little
shy
but
when
i
had
them
up
in
line
and
had
shown
them
what
a
large
proportion
of
an
glove
is
padding
they
grew
more
at
ease
to
be
asked
suddenly
to
fight
three
rounds
with
one
of
your
friends
before
an
audience
also
of
your
friends
is
embarrassing
one
feels
hot
and
uncomfortable
boys
jibbed
nervously
as
a
preliminary
measure
therefore
i
drilled
them
in
a
class
at
and
the
left
lead
they
found
the
exercise
exhilarating
if
this
was
the
idea
they
seemed
to
say
let
the
thing
go
on
then
i
showed
them
how
to
be
highly
scientific
with
a
punch
ball
finally
i
sparred
lightly
with
them
myself
in
the
rough
they
were
impossible
boxers
after
their
initial
distrust
had
evaporated
under
my
gentle
handling
of
them
they
forgot
all
i
had
taught
them
about
position
and
guards
they
bored
in
heads
down
and
arms
going
like
semicircular
pistons
once
or
twice
i
had
to
stop
them
they
were
easily
steadied
they
hastened
to
adopt
a
certain
snakiness
of
attack
instead
of
the
frontal
method
which
had
left
them
so
exposed
they
began
to
cultivate
a
kind
of
negative
style
they
were
tremendously
impressed
by
the
superiority
of
science
over
strength
i
am
not
sure
that
i
did
not
harp
rather
too
much
on
the
scientific
note
perhaps
if
i
had
referred
to
it
less
the
ultimate
disaster
would
not
have
been
quite
so
appalling
on
the
other
hand
i
had
not
the
slightest
suspicion
that
they
would
so
exaggerate
my
meaning
when
i
was
remarking
on
the
worth
of
science
how
it
tells
and
how
it
causes
the
meagre
stripling
to
play
fast
and
loose
with
huge
brawny
ruffians
no
cowards
mark
you
and
hairy
as
to
their
chests
but
the
weeds
at
hatton
club
were
fascinated
by
my
homilies
on
science
the
simplicity
of
the
thing
appealed
to
them
irresistibly
they
caught
at
the
expression
science
and
regarded
it
as
the
hey
presto
of
a
friendly
conjurer
who
could
so
arrange
matters
for
them
that
powerful
opponents
would
fall
flat
involuntarily
at
the
sight
of
their
technically
correct
attitude
i
did
not
like
to
destroy
their
illusions
had
i
said
to
them
look
here
science
is
no
practical
use
to
you
unless
you
got
snub
noses
protruding
temples
nostrils
like
the
tubes
of
a
stomach
muscles
like
wheels
hands
like
legs
of
mutton
and
biceps
like
transatlantic
cables
had
i
said
that
they
would
have
voted
boxing
a
fraud
and
gone
away
to
quarrel
over
a
game
of
backgammon
which
was
precisely
what
i
wished
to
avoid
so
i
let
them
go
on
with
their
tapping
and
feinting
and
to
make
it
worse
they
overheard
sidney
price
trying
to
pay
me
a
compliment
price
was
the
insurance
clerk
who
had
attached
himself
to
hatton
and
had
proved
himself
to
be
of
real
service
in
many
ways
he
was
an
honest
man
but
he
could
not
box
he
came
down
to
the
hall
one
night
after
i
had
given
four
or
five
lessons
to
watch
the
boys
spar
of
course
to
the
uninitiated
eye
it
did
seem
as
though
they
were
neat
in
their
work
the
sight
was
very
different
from
the
absurd
exhibition
which
price
had
seen
on
the
night
i
started
with
them
he
might
easily
have
said
if
he
was
determined
to
compliment
me
that
they
had
improved
progressed
or
something
equally
adequate
and
innocuous
but
no
the
man
must
needs
be
effusive
positively
gushing
he
came
to
me
in
transports
wonderful
he
said
wonderful
what
wonderful
i
said
a
shade
irritably
their
style
he
said
loudly
so
that
they
could
all
hear
their
style
it
their
style
that
astonishes
me
i
hustled
him
away
as
soon
as
i
could
but
the
mischief
was
done
style
ran
through
hatton
club
boys
like
an
epidemic
carnation
hall
fairly
buzzed
with
style
an
apology
for
a
blow
which
landed
on
your
chest
with
the
delicacy
of
an
agag
among
butterflies
was
extolled
to
the
skies
because
it
was
a
stylish
blow
when
alf
joblin
a
recruit
sent
walter
greenway
sprawling
with
a
random
swing
on
the
mark
there
was
a
pained
shudder
not
only
walter
greenway
but
the
whole
club
explained
to
alf
that
the
swing
was
a
bad
swing
an
awful
violation
of
style
practically
a
crime
by
the
time
they
had
finished
explaining
alf
was
dazed
and
when
invited
by
walter
to
repeat
the
hit
with
a
view
to
his
being
further
impressed
with
its
want
of
style
did
so
in
such
fashion
that
walter
had
time
to
step
stylishly
aside
and
show
alf
how
futile
it
is
to
be
unscientific
to
the
club
this
episode
was
decently
buried
in
an
unremembered
past
to
me
however
it
was
significant
though
i
did
not
imagine
it
would
ever
have
the
tremendous
sequel
which
was
brought
about
by
the
coming
of
thomas
blake
fate
never
planned
a
coup
so
successfully
the
psychology
of
arrival
was
perfect
the
boxers
of
carnation
hall
had
worked
themselves
into
a
mental
condition
which
i
knew
was
as
ridiculous
as
it
was
dangerous
their
conceit
and
their
imagination
transformed
the
hall
into
a
kind
of
improved
national
sporting
club
they
went
about
with
an
air
of
subdued
but
tremendous
athleticism
they
affected
a
sort
of
nonchalance
they
adopted
an
odiously
patronising
attitude
towards
the
once
popular
game
of
backgammon
i
daresay
that
picture
is
not
yet
forgotten
where
a
british
general
a
man
of
blood
and
iron
is
portrayed
as
playing
with
a
baby
to
the
utter
neglect
of
a
table
full
of
important
military
dispatches
well
the
club
boys
to
a
boy
posed
as
generals
of
blood
and
iron
when
they
condescended
to
play
backgammon
they
did
it
but
they
let
you
see
that
they
did
not
regard
it
as
one
of
the
serious
things
of
life
also
knowing
that
each
other
hitting
was
so
scientific
as
to
be
harmless
they
would
sometimes
deliberately
put
their
eye
in
front
of
their
opponent
stylish
left
in
the
hope
that
the
blow
would
raise
a
bruise
it
hardly
ever
did
but
occasionally
oh
then
you
should
have
seen
the
look
on
their
faces
as
they
lounged
ostentatiously
about
the
place
in
a
word
they
were
above
themselves
they
sighed
for
fresh
worlds
to
conquer
and
thomas
blake
supplied
the
want
personally
i
did
not
see
his
actual
arrival
i
only
saw
his
handiwork
after
he
had
been
a
visitor
awhile
within
the
hall
but
to
avoid
unnecessary
verbiage
and
to
avail
myself
of
the
privilege
of
an
author
i
will
set
down
from
the
evidence
of
witnesses
the
main
points
of
the
episode
as
though
i
myself
had
been
present
at
his
entrance
he
did
not
strike
them
i
am
informed
as
a
particularly
big
man
he
was
a
shade
under
average
height
his
shoulders
seemed
to
them
not
so
much
broad
as
humpy
he
rolled
straight
in
from
the
street
on
a
wet
saturday
night
at
ten
minutes
to
nine
asking
for
free
tea
i
should
mention
that
on
certain
fridays
hatton
gave
a
free
meal
to
his
parishioners
on
the
understanding
that
it
was
rigidly
connected
with
a
short
address
the
preceding
friday
had
been
such
an
occasion
the
placards
announcing
the
tea
were
still
clinging
to
the
outer
railings
of
the
hall
when
i
said
that
blake
asked
for
free
tea
i
should
have
said
shouted
for
free
tea
he
cast
one
decisive
glance
at
hatton
placards
and
rolled
up
he
shot
into
the
gate
up
the
steps
down
the
passage
and
through
the
door
leading
into
the
big
hall
which
i
used
for
my
lessons
and
all
the
time
he
kept
shouting
for
free
tea
in
the
hall
the
members
of
my
class
were
collected
some
were
changing
their
clothes
others
already
changed
were
tapping
the
they
knew
that
i
always
came
punctually
at
nine
and
they
liked
to
be
ready
for
me
amongst
those
present
was
sidney
price
thomas
blake
brought
up
short
hiccuping
in
the
midst
of
them
gim
me
that
free
tea
he
said
sidney
price
whose
moral
fortitude
has
never
been
impeached
was
the
first
to
handle
the
situation
my
good
man
he
said
i
am
sorry
to
say
you
have
made
a
mistake
a
mistake
said
thomas
quickly
taking
him
up
a
mistake
oh
what
oh
my
errer
quite
so
said
price
diplomatically
an
error
thomas
blake
sat
down
on
the
floor
fumbled
for
a
short
pipe
and
said
seems
ter
me
i
sick
of
errers
sick
of
made
a
bloomer
this
mornin
this
way
here
he
took
into
his
confidence
the
group
which
had
gathered
uncertainly
round
him
my
wife
brother
wot
a
postman
owes
me
arf
a
bloomin
thick
a
bloke
and
ter
save
trouble
i
came
down
from
brentford
where
my
boat
lies
to
catch
on
rounds
lot
of
catchin
wanted
too
i
think
tracked
by
the
knocks
at
last
and
then
wot
think
said
did
know
nothing
about
no
ruddy
thick
and
would
i
kindly
cease
to
impede
a
public
servant
in
the
discharge
of
dooty
otherwise
the
perlice
that
mind
you
was
my
own
oh
he
a
nice
man
i
think
thomas
blake
nodded
his
head
as
one
who
though
pained
by
the
hollowness
of
life
is
resigned
to
it
and
proceeded
to
doze
the
crowd
gazed
at
him
and
murmured
sidney
price
however
stepped
forward
with
authority
you
better
be
going
he
said
and
he
gently
jogged
the
recumbent
boatman
elbow
leave
me
be
i
want
my
tea
was
the
muttered
and
lyrical
reply
hook
it
said
price
without
my
tea
asked
blake
opening
his
eyes
wide
it
was
yesterday
explained
price
brusquely
there
is
any
free
tea
tonight
the
effect
was
magical
a
very
sinister
expression
came
over
the
face
of
the
prostrate
one
and
he
slowly
clambered
to
his
feet
ho
he
said
disengaging
himself
from
his
coat
ho
there
ai
no
free
tea
ternight
ai
there
bills
stuck
on
them
railings
in
errer
i
suppose
another
bloomin
errer
seems
to
me
i
sick
of
errers
wot
i
says
is
on
all
of
yer
i
tom
blake
i
am
you
can
arst
them
down
at
brentford
kind
old
tom
blake
wot
would
hurt
a
fly
and
i
says
on
all
of
yer
and
i
knock
yer
insides
through
yer
backbones
sidney
price
spoke
again
his
words
were
honeyed
but
ineffectual
i
honest
old
tom
i
am
boomed
thomas
blake
and
i
ready
for
the
lot
of
yer
you
and
yer
free
tea
and
yer
errers
at
this
point
alf
joblin
detached
himself
from
the
hovering
crowd
and
said
to
price
he
must
be
cowed
i
knock
sense
into
the
drunken
brute
well
said
price
he
got
to
go
but
you
wo
hurt
him
alf
will
you
no
said
alf
i
wo
hurt
him
i
just
make
him
look
a
fool
this
is
where
science
comes
in
i
honest
old
tom
droned
the
boatman
if
you
have
it
said
alf
with
fine
aposiopesis
he
squared
up
to
him
now
alf
joblin
like
the
other
pugilists
of
my
class
habitually
refrained
from
delivering
any
sort
of
attack
until
he
was
well
assured
that
he
had
seen
an
orthodox
opening
a
large
part
of
every
round
between
hatton
boys
was
devoted
to
stealthy
circular
movements
signifying
nothing
but
thomas
blake
had
not
had
the
advantage
of
scientific
tuition
he
came
banging
in
with
a
sweeping
right
alf
stopped
him
with
his
left
again
blake
swung
his
right
and
again
he
took
alf
stopping
blow
without
a
blink
then
he
went
straight
in
right
and
left
in
quick
succession
the
force
of
the
right
was
broken
by
alf
guard
but
the
left
got
home
on
the
mark
and
alf
wind
left
him
suddenly
he
sat
down
on
the
floor
to
say
that
this
tragedy
in
less
than
five
seconds
produced
dismay
among
the
onlookers
would
be
incorrect
they
were
not
dismayed
they
were
amused
they
thought
that
alf
had
laid
himself
open
to
chaff
whether
he
had
slipped
or
lost
his
head
they
did
not
know
but
as
for
thinking
that
alf
with
all
his
scientific
knowledge
was
not
more
than
a
match
for
this
ignorant
intoxicated
boatman
such
a
reflection
never
entered
their
heads
what
is
more
each
separate
member
of
the
audience
was
convinced
that
he
individually
was
the
proper
person
to
illustrate
the
efficacy
of
style
versus
untutored
savagery
as
soon
therefore
as
alf
joblin
went
writhing
to
the
floor
and
thomas
blake
voice
was
raised
afresh
in
a
universal
challenge
walter
greenway
stepped
briskly
forward
and
as
soon
as
walter
guard
had
been
smashed
down
by
a
most
unconventional
attack
and
walter
himself
had
been
knocked
senseless
by
a
swing
on
the
side
of
the
jaw
bill
shale
leaped
gaily
forth
to
take
his
place
and
so
it
happened
that
when
i
entered
the
building
at
nine
it
was
as
though
a
devastating
tornado
had
swept
down
every
club
boy
sparing
only
sidney
price
who
was
preparing
miserably
to
meet
his
fate
to
me
standing
in
the
doorway
the
situation
was
plain
at
the
first
glance
only
by
a
big
effort
could
i
prevent
myself
laughing
outright
it
was
impossible
to
check
a
grin
thomas
blake
saw
me
hullo
i
said
what
all
this
he
stared
at
me
he
said
another
of
is
it
i
honest
old
tom
blake
am
and
wot
i
say
is
why
honest
mr
blake
i
interrupted
call
me
a
liar
then
said
he
go
on
you
do
it
call
it
me
then
and
let
see
he
began
to
shuffle
towards
me
who
pinched
his
father
trousers
and
popped
them
i
inquired
genially
he
stopped
and
blinked
eh
he
said
weakly
and
who
i
continued
when
sent
with
twopence
to
buy
squandered
it
on
beer
his
jaw
dropped
as
it
had
dropped
in
covent
garden
it
must
be
very
unpleasant
to
have
one
past
continually
rising
up
to
confront
one
look
he
said
a
conciliatory
note
in
his
voice
you
and
pals
mister
ai
we
say
we
pals
of
course
we
are
you
and
me
do
want
no
fuss
of
course
we
do
then
look
here
this
is
it
is
you
come
along
with
me
and
a
drop
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
my
class
would
require
any
instruction
in
boxing
that
evening
in
addition
to
that
which
blake
had
given
them
so
i
went
with
him
over
the
moisture
as
he
facetiously
described
it
he
grew
friendliness
itself
he
did
not
ask
after
kit
but
gave
his
opinion
of
her
gratuitously
according
to
him
she
was
unkind
to
her
relations
crool
he
said
a
girl
in
fact
who
made
no
allowances
for
a
man
and
was
to
sauce
and
the
nasty
snack
we
parted
the
best
of
friends
any
time
you
on
the
cut
he
said
gripping
my
hand
with
painful
fervour
you
look
out
for
tom
blake
mister
tom
blake
of
the
and
no
ceremony
jest
drop
in
on
me
and
the
missis
goo
night
at
the
moment
of
writing
tom
blake
is
rapidly
acquiring
an
assured
position
in
the
heart
of
the
british
public
this
incident
in
his
career
should
interest
his
numerous
admirers
the
world
knows
little
of
its
greatest
men
chapter
julian
idea
james
orlebar
cloyster
narrative
continued
i
had
been
relating
on
the
morning
after
the
blake
affair
the
stirring
episode
of
the
previous
night
to
julian
he
agreed
with
me
that
it
was
curious
that
our
of
covent
garden
market
should
have
crossed
my
path
again
but
i
noticed
that
though
he
listened
intently
enough
he
lay
flat
on
his
back
in
his
hammock
not
looking
at
me
but
blinking
at
the
ceiling
and
when
i
had
finished
he
turned
his
face
towards
the
wall
which
was
unusual
since
i
generally
lunched
on
his
breakfast
as
i
was
doing
then
to
the
accompaniment
of
quite
a
flow
of
languid
abuse
i
was
in
particularly
high
spirits
that
morning
for
i
fancied
that
i
had
found
a
way
out
of
my
difficulty
about
margaret
that
subject
being
uppermost
in
my
mind
i
guessed
at
once
what
julian
trouble
was
i
think
you
like
to
know
julian
i
said
whether
i
written
to
guernsey
well
it
all
right
i
said
you
told
her
to
come
no
but
i
able
to
take
my
respite
without
wounding
her
that
as
good
as
writing
is
it
we
agreed
on
that
yes
that
was
the
idea
if
you
could
find
a
way
of
keeping
her
from
knowing
how
well
you
were
getting
on
with
your
writing
you
were
to
take
it
what
your
idea
i
hit
on
a
very
simple
way
out
of
the
difficulty
i
said
it
came
to
me
only
this
morning
all
i
need
do
is
to
sign
my
stuff
with
a
pseudonym
you
only
thought
of
that
this
morning
yes
why
my
dear
chap
i
thought
of
it
as
soon
as
you
told
me
of
the
fix
you
were
in
you
might
have
suggested
it
julian
slid
to
the
floor
drained
the
almost
empty
teapot
rescued
the
last
kidney
and
began
his
breakfast
i
would
have
suggested
it
he
said
if
the
idea
had
been
worth
anything
what
what
wrong
with
it
my
dear
man
it
too
risky
it
not
as
though
you
kept
to
one
form
of
literary
work
you
so
confoundedly
versatile
let
suppose
you
did
sign
your
work
with
a
de
say
george
chandos
all
right
george
chandos
well
how
long
would
it
be
do
you
think
before
paragraphs
appeared
announcing
to
the
public
not
only
of
england
but
of
the
channel
islands
that
george
chandos
was
really
jimmy
cloyster
what
rot
i
said
why
the
deuce
should
they
want
to
write
paragraphs
about
me
i
not
a
celebrity
you
talking
through
your
hat
julian
julian
lit
his
pipe
not
at
all
he
said
count
the
number
of
people
who
must
necessarily
be
in
the
secret
from
the
beginning
there
are
your
publishers
prodder
and
way
then
there
are
the
editors
of
the
magazine
which
publishes
your
society
dialogue
bilge
and
of
all
the
newspapers
other
than
the
in
which
your
serious
verse
appears
my
dear
jimmy
the
news
that
you
and
george
chandos
were
the
same
man
would
go
up
and
down
fleet
street
and
into
the
barrel
like
wildfire
and
after
that
the
paragraphs
i
saw
the
truth
of
his
reasoning
before
he
had
finished
speaking
once
more
my
spirits
fell
to
the
point
where
they
had
been
before
i
hit
upon
what
i
thought
was
such
a
bright
scheme
julian
pipe
had
gone
out
while
he
was
talking
he
lit
it
again
and
spoke
through
the
smoke
the
weak
point
of
your
idea
of
course
is
that
you
and
george
chandos
are
a
single
individual
but
why
should
the
editors
know
that
why
should
i
simply
send
in
my
stuff
typed
by
post
and
never
appear
myself
at
all
my
dear
jimmy
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
that
would
work
it
would
do
all
right
for
a
bit
then
one
morning
chandos
i
should
be
glad
if
you
could
make
it
convenient
to
call
here
some
time
between
tuesday
and
yours
faithfully
editor
of
sooner
or
later
a
man
who
writes
at
all
regularly
for
the
papers
is
bound
to
meet
the
editors
of
them
a
successful
author
ca
conduct
all
his
business
through
the
post
of
course
if
you
chucked
london
and
went
to
live
in
the
country
i
could
i
said
i
simply
could
do
it
london
got
into
my
bones
it
does
said
julian
i
like
the
country
but
i
could
live
there
besides
i
believe
i
could
write
there
not
for
long
all
my
ideas
would
go
julian
nodded
just
so
he
said
then
exit
george
chandos
my
scheme
is
worthless
you
think
then
as
you
state
it
yes
you
mean
i
prompted
quickly
clutching
at
something
in
his
tone
which
seemed
to
suggest
that
he
did
not
consider
the
matter
entirely
hopeless
i
mean
this
the
weak
spot
in
your
idea
as
i
told
you
is
that
you
and
george
chandos
have
the
same
body
now
if
you
could
manage
to
provide
george
with
separate
flesh
and
blood
of
his
own
there
no
reason
by
jove
you
hit
it
go
on
listen
here
is
my
rough
draft
of
what
i
think
might
be
a
sound
working
system
how
many
divisions
does
your
work
fall
into
not
counting
the
i
reflected
well
of
course
i
do
a
certain
amount
of
odd
work
but
lately
rather
narrowed
it
down
and
concentrated
my
output
it
seemed
to
me
a
better
plan
than
sowing
stuff
indiscriminately
through
all
the
papers
in
london
well
how
many
stunts
have
you
got
there
your
serious
verse
one
and
your
society
stuff
two
any
more
novels
and
short
stories
class
them
together
three
any
more
no
that
all
very
well
then
what
you
must
do
is
to
look
about
you
and
pick
carefully
three
men
on
whom
you
can
rely
divide
your
signed
stuff
between
these
three
men
they
will
receive
your
copy
sign
it
with
their
own
names
and
see
that
it
gets
to
wherever
you
want
to
send
it
as
far
as
the
editorial
world
is
concerned
and
as
far
as
the
public
is
concerned
they
will
become
actually
the
authors
of
the
manuscripts
which
you
have
prepared
for
them
to
sign
they
will
forward
you
the
cheques
when
they
arrive
and
keep
accounts
to
which
you
will
have
access
i
suppose
you
will
have
to
pay
them
a
commission
on
a
scale
to
be
fixed
by
mutual
arrangement
as
regards
your
unsigned
work
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
your
doing
that
yourself
your
way
i
mean
whenever
there
any
holiday
work
going
general
articles
and
light
verse
i
say
though
half
a
moment
why
what
i
thought
of
a
difficulty
the
editors
who
have
been
taking
your
stuff
hitherto
may
have
a
respect
for
the
name
of
james
orlebar
cloyster
which
they
may
not
extend
to
the
name
of
john
smith
or
george
chandos
or
whoever
it
is
i
mean
it
quite
likely
the
withdrawal
of
the
name
will
lead
to
the
rejection
of
the
manuscript
oh
no
that
all
right
i
said
it
the
stuff
they
want
not
the
name
i
do
say
that
names
do
matter
they
do
but
only
if
big
names
kipling
might
get
a
story
rejected
if
he
sent
it
in
under
a
false
name
which
they
have
taken
otherwise
just
because
he
was
kipling
what
they
want
from
me
is
the
goods
i
can
shove
any
label
on
them
i
like
the
editor
will
read
my
ghosts
stuff
see
it
what
he
wants
and
put
it
in
he
may
say
rather
like
cloyster
style
but
he
certainly
add
it
what
i
want
you
can
scratch
that
difficulty
julian
any
more
i
think
not
of
course
there
the
objection
that
you
lose
any
celebrity
you
might
have
got
no
one
say
cloyster
i
enjoyed
your
last
book
so
much
and
no
one
say
do
you
cloyster
how
interesting
what
have
you
written
you
must
send
me
a
copy
that
true
in
any
case
it
celebrity
against
the
respite
obscurity
against
miss
goodwin
while
the
system
is
in
operation
you
will
be
free
but
inglorious
you
choose
freedom
all
right
then
pass
the
matches
chapter
the
first
ghost
james
orlebar
cloyster
narrative
continued
such
was
the
suggestion
julian
made
and
i
praised
its
ingenuity
little
thinking
how
bitterly
i
should
come
to
curse
it
in
the
future
i
was
immediately
all
anxiety
to
set
the
scheme
working
will
you
be
one
of
my
three
middlemen

i
asked
he
shook
his
head
thanks
he
said
it
very
good
of
you
but
i
dare
encroach
further
on
my
hours
of
leisure
skeffington
sloe
gin
has
already
become
an
incubus
i
could
not
move
him
from
this
decision
it
is
not
everybody
who
in
a
moment
of
emergency
can
put
his
hand
on
three
men
of
his
acquaintance
capable
of
carrying
through
a
more
or
less
delicate
business
for
him
certainly
i
found
a
difficulty
in
making
my
selection
i
ran
over
the
list
of
my
friends
in
my
mind
then
i
was
compelled
to
take
pencil
and
paper
and
settle
down
seriously
to
what
i
now
saw
would
be
a
task
of
some
difficulty
after
half
an
hour
i
read
through
my
list
and
could
not
help
smiling
i
had
indeed
a
mixed
lot
of
acquaintances
first
came
julian
and
malim
the
two
pillars
of
my
world
i
scratched
them
out
julian
had
been
asked
and
had
refused
and
as
for
malim
i
shrank
from
exposing
my
absurd
compositions
to
his
critical
eye
a
man
who
could
deal
so
trenchantly
over
a
pipe
and
a
with
established
reputations
would
hardly
take
kindly
to
seeing
my
work
in
print
under
his
name
i
wished
it
had
been
possible
to
secure
him
but
i
did
not
disguise
it
from
myself
that
it
was
not
the
rest
of
the
list
was
made
up
of
members
of
the
barrel
club
impossible
because
of
their
inherent
tendency
to
break
out
into
personal
paragraphs
writers
like
fermin
and
gresham
above
me
on
the
literary
ladder
and
consequently
unapproachable
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
certain
college
friends
who
had
vanished
into
space
as
men
do
on
coming
down
from
the
leaving
no
address
john
hatton
sidney
price
and
tom
blake
there
were
only
three
men
in
that
list
to
whom
i
felt
i
could
take
my
suggestion
hatton
was
one
price
was
another
and
blake
was
the
third
hatton
should
have
my
fiction
price
my
society
stuff
blake
my
serious
verse
that
evening
i
went
off
to
the
temple
to
sound
hatton
on
the
subject
of
signing
my
third
book
the
wretched
sale
of
my
first
two
had
acted
as
something
of
a
check
to
my
enthusiasm
for
i
had
paused
to
take
stock
of
my
position
my
first
two
novels
had
i
found
on
them
too
much
of
the
tone
in
them
to
be
popular
that
is
the
mistake
a
man
falls
into
through
being
at
cambridge
or
oxford
he
fancies
unconsciously
that
the
world
is
peopled
with
undergraduates
he
forgets
that
what
appeals
to
an
undergraduate
public
may
be
greek
to
the
outside
reader
and
unfortunately
not
compulsory
greek
the
reviewers
had
dealt
kindly
with
my
two
books
this
pleasant
little
squib
full
of
quiet
humour
should
amuse
all
who
remember
their
undergraduate
days
but
the
great
heart
of
the
public
had
remained
untouched
as
had
the
great
purse
of
the
public
i
had
determined
to
adopt
a
different
style
and
now
my
third
book
was
ready
it
was
called
it
was
with
the
tale
of
god
and
there
was
a
piquant
admixture
of
love
religion
and
eastern
scenery
which
seemed
to
point
to
a
record
number
of
editions
i
took
the
of
this
book
with
me
to
the
temple
hatton
was
in
i
flung
it
was
on
the
table
and
sat
down
what
this
inquired
hatton
fingering
the
parcel
if
it
the
corpse
of
a
murdered
editor
i
think
it
only
fair
to
let
you
know
that
i
have
a
prejudice
against
having
my
rooms
used
as
a
cemetery
go
and
throw
him
into
the
river
it
anything
but
a
corpse
it
the
most
lively
bit
of
writing
ever
done
there
enough
fire
in
that
book
to
singe
your
tablecloth
you
are
going
to
read
it
to
me
out
loud
he
said
anxiously
no
have
i
got
to
read
it
when
you
gone
not
unless
you
wish
to
then
why
if
i
may
ask
do
you
carry
about
a
parcel
which
i
should
say
weighs
anything
between
one
and
two
tons
simply
to
use
it
as
a
temporary
table
ornament
is
it
the
sandow
system
no
i
said
it
like
this
and
suddenly
it
dawned
on
me
that
it
was
not
going
to
be
particularly
easy
to
explain
to
hatton
just
what
it
was
that
i
wanted
him
to
do
i
made
the
thing
clear
at
last
suppressing
of
course
my
reasons
for
the
move
when
he
had
grasped
my
meaning
he
looked
at
me
rather
curiously
does
it
strike
you
he
said
that
what
you
propose
is
slightly
dishonourable
you
mean
that
i
have
come
deliberately
to
insult
you
hatton
our
conversation
seems
to
be
getting
difficult
unless
you
grant
that
honour
is
not
one
immovable
intangible
landmark
fixed
for
humanity
but
that
it
is
a
commodity
we
all
carry
with
us
in
varying
forms
personally
i
believe
that
as
a
help
to
identification
would
be
as
useful
as
fingerprints
good
you
agree
with
me
now
you
may
have
a
different
view
but
in
my
opinion
if
i
were
to
pose
as
the
writer
of
your
books
and
gained
credit
for
a
literary
skill
i
laughed
you
wo
get
credit
for
literary
skill
out
of
the
sort
of
books
i
want
you
to
put
your
name
to
they
potboilers
you
need
worry
about
fame
you
be
a
martyr
not
a
hero
you
may
be
right
you
wrote
the
book
but
in
any
case
i
should
be
more
of
a
charlatan
than
i
care
about
you
wo
do
it
i
said
i
sorry
it
would
have
been
a
great
convenience
to
me
on
the
other
hand
continued
hatton
ignoring
my
remark
there
are
arguments
in
favour
of
such
a
scheme
as
you
suggest
stout
fellow
i
said
encouragingly
to
examine
the
matter
in
its
er
financial
to
suppose
for
a
moment
briefly
what
do
i
get
out
of
it
ten
per
cent
he
looked
thoughtful
the
end
shall
justify
the
means
he
said
the
money
you
pay
me
can
do
something
to
help
the
awful
the
continual
poverty
of
lambeth
yes
james
cloyster
i
will
sign
whatever
you
send
me
good
for
you
i
said
and
i
shall
come
better
out
of
the
transaction
than
you
no
one
would
credit
the
way
that
man
a
clergyman
too
haggled
over
terms
he
ended
by
squeezing
fifteen
per
cent
out
of
me
chapter
the
second
ghost
james
orlebar
cloyster
narrative
continued
the
reasons
which
had
led
me
to
select
sidney
price
as
the
sponsor
of
my
society
dialogues
will
be
immediately
apparent
to
those
who
have
read
them
they
were
just
the
sort
of
things
you
would
expect
an
insurance
clerk
to
write
the
humour
was
thin
the
satire
as
cheap
as
the
papers
in
which
they
appeared
and
the
vulgarity
in
exactly
the
right
quantity
for
a
public
that
ate
it
by
the
pound
and
asked
for
more
every
thing
pointed
to
sidney
price
as
the
man
it
was
my
intention
to
allow
each
of
my
three
ghosts
to
imagine
that
he
was
alone
in
the
business
so
i
did
not
get
price
address
from
hatton
who
might
have
wondered
why
i
wanted
it
and
had
suspicions
i
applied
to
the
doorkeeper
at
carnation
hall
and
on
the
following
evening
i
rang
the
bell
of
the
hollyhocks
belmont
park
road
brixton
whilst
i
was
waiting
on
the
step
i
was
able
to
get
a
view
through
the
slats
of
the
venetian
blind
of
the
front
i
could
scarcely
restrain
a
cry
of
pure
aesthetic
delight
at
what
i
saw
within
price
was
sitting
on
a
sofa
with
an
arm
round
the
waist
of
a
rather
girl
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
it
was
edwin
and
angelina
in
real
life
up
till
then
i
had
suffered
much
discomfort
from
the
illustrated
record
of
their
adventures
in
the
comic
papers
is
there
really
i
had
often
asked
myself
a
body
of
men
so
gifted
that
they
can
construct
the
impossible
details
of
the
lives
of
nonexistent
types
purely
from
imagination
if
such
creative
genius
as
theirs
is
unrecognized
and
ignored
what
hope
of
recognition
is
there
for
one
own
work
the
thought
had
frequently
saddened
me
but
here
at
last
they
were
edwin
and
angelina
in
the
flesh
i
took
the
gallant
sidney
for
a
stroll
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
belmont
park
road
poor
angelina
he
came
as
he
expressed
it
like
a
bird
give
him
a
sec
to
slip
on
a
pair
of
boots
he
said
and
he
would
be
with
me
in
two
ticks
he
was
so
busy
getting
his
hat
and
stick
from
the
stand
in
the
passage
that
he
quite
forgot
to
tell
the
lady
that
he
was
going
out
and
as
we
left
i
saw
her
with
the
tail
of
my
eye
sitting
stolidly
on
the
sofa
still
wearing
patiently
the
expression
of
her
portraits
the
task
of
explaining
was
easier
than
it
had
been
with
hatton
sorry
to
drag
you
out
price
i
said
as
we
went
down
the
steps
do
mention
it
cloyster
he
said
norah
wo
mind
a
bit
of
a
sit
by
herself
looked
in
to
have
a
chat
or
is
there
anything
i
can
do
it
like
this
i
said
you
know
i
write
a
good
deal
yes
well
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
go
on
turning
out
quantities
of
stuff
under
my
own
name
there
a
danger
of
the
public
getting
tired
of
me
he
nodded
now
i
with
you
there
mind
you
he
said
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
some
chaps
say
i
say
you
can
stands
to
reason
a
chap
ca
go
on
writing
and
writing
without
making
a
bloomer
every
now
and
then
what
he
wants
is
to
take
his
time
over
it
look
at
all
the
real
swells
spencer
marie
corelli
and
what
not
you
do
find
them
pushing
it
out
every
day
of
the
year
they
wait
a
bit
and
have
a
look
round
and
then
they
start
again
when
they
ready
stands
to
reason
that
the
only
way
quite
right
i
said
but
the
difficulty
if
you
live
by
writing
is
that
you
must
turn
out
a
good
deal
or
you
do
make
enough
to
live
on
i
got
to
go
on
getting
stuff
published
but
i
do
want
people
to
be
always
seeing
my
name
about
you
mean
adopt
a
de
that
the
sort
of
idea
but
i
going
to
vary
it
a
little
and
i
explained
my
plan
but
why
me
he
asked
when
he
had
understood
the
scheme
what
made
you
think
of
me
the
fact
is
my
dear
fellow
i
said
this
writing
is
a
game
where
personality
counts
to
an
enormous
extent
the
man
who
signs
my
society
dialogues
will
probably
come
into
personal
contact
with
the
editors
of
the
papers
in
which
they
appear
he
will
be
asked
to
call
at
their
offices
so
you
see
i
must
have
a
man
who
looks
as
if
he
had
written
the
stuff
i
see
he
said
complacently
dressy
sort
of
chap
chap
who
looks
as
if
he
knew
a
thing
or
two
yes
i
could
get
alf
joblin
for
instance
we
laughed
together
at
the
notion
poor
old
alf
said
sidney
price
now
you
probably
know
a
good
deal
about
society
said
sidney
they
a
hot
lot
my
saw
walls
of
three
times
gives
it
pretty
straight
that
does
of
too
chase
me
used
to
think
some
of
us
chaps
in
the
were
a
bit
but
we
are
in
it
not
in
the
same
street
chaps
i
mean
who
call
a
girl
behind
the
bar
by
her
christian
name
as
soon
as
look
at
you
one
chap
i
knew
used
to
give
the
girl
at
the
of
the
he
went
to
bottles
of
scent
bottles
of
it
regular
you
are
tottie
he
used
to
say
another
little
donation
from
yours
truly
kissed
her
once
slap
in
front
of
everybody
saw
him
do
it
but
bless
you
they
think
nothing
of
that
in
the
smart
set
ever
read
good
man
there
a
book
my
stars
lets
you
see
what
goes
on
scorchers
they
are
that
just
what
my
dialogues
point
out
i
can
count
on
you
then
he
said
i
could
he
was
an
intelligent
young
man
and
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
all
would
be
well
he
would
carry
the
job
through
on
the
strict
he
closely
willingly
with
my
offer
of
ten
per
cent
thus
affording
a
striking
contrast
to
the
grasping
hatton
he
assured
me
he
had
found
literary
chaps
not
half
bad
had
occasionally
had
an
idea
of
writing
a
bit
himself
we
parted
on
good
terms
and
i
was
pleased
to
think
that
i
was
placing
my
dialogues
of
mayfair
and
my
london
and
country
house
tales
in
really
competent
and
appreciative
hands
chapter
the
third
ghost
james
orlebar
cloyster
narrative
continued
there
only
remained
now
my
serious
verse
of
which
i
turned
out
an
enormous
quantity
it
won
a
ready
acceptance
in
many
quarters
notably
the
stephen
already
i
was
beginning
to
oust
from
their
positions
on
that
excellent
journal
the
old
crusted
poetesses
who
had
supplied
it
from
its
foundation
with
verse
the
prices
they
paid
on
the
were
in
excellent
taste
in
the
musical
world
too
i
was
making
way
rapidly
lyrics
of
the
type
streamed
from
my
pen
sleep
whilst
i
sing
love
had
brought
me
in
an
astonishing
amount
of
money
in
spite
of
the
it
was
on
the
adults
hummed
it
infants
crooned
it
in
their
cots
comic
men
at
opened
their
turns
by
remarking
soothingly
to
the
conductor
of
the
orchestra
i
going
to
sing
now
so
you
go
to
sleep
love
in
a
word
while
the
boom
lasted
it
was
a
little
to
me
thomas
blake
was
as
obviously
the
man
for
me
here
as
sidney
price
had
been
in
the
case
of
my
society
dialogues
the
public
would
find
something
infinitely
piquant
in
the
thought
that
its
most
sentimental
ditties
were
given
to
it
by
the
steerer
of
a
canal
barge
he
would
be
greeted
as
the
modern
burns
people
would
ask
him
how
he
thought
of
his
poems
and
he
would
say
and
they
would
hail
him
as
delightfully
original
in
the
case
of
thomas
blake
i
saw
my
earnings
going
up
with
a
bound
his
personality
would
be
a
noble
advertisement
he
was
aboard
the
or
on
the
cut
so
i
was
informed
by
kit
which
information
was
not
luminous
to
me
further
inquiries
however
led
me
to
the
bridge
at
brentford
whence
starts
that
almost
unknown
system
of
inland
navigation
which
extends
to
manchester
and
birmingham
here
i
accosted
at
a
venture
a
ruminative
bargee
tom
blake
he
repeated
reflectively
oh
been
off
this
three
hours
on
a
trip
to
braunston
he
tie
up
tonight
at
the
shovel
where
the
shovel
past
cowley
the
shovel
is
this
was
spoken
in
a
tired
drawl
which
was
evidently
meant
to
preclude
further
to
clinch
things
he
slouched
away
waving
me
in
an
abstracted
manner
to
the
towpath
i
took
the
hint
it
was
now
three
in
the
afternoon
judging
by
the
pace
of
the
barges
i
had
seen
i
should
catch
blake
easily
before
nightfall
i
set
out
briskly
an
hour
walking
brought
me
to
hanwell
and
i
was
glad
to
see
a
regular
chain
of
locks
which
must
have
considerably
delayed
the
and
the
afternoon
wore
on
i
went
steadily
forward
making
inquiries
as
to
thomas
whereabouts
from
the
boats
which
met
me
and
always
hearing
that
he
was
still
ahead
footsore
and
hungry
i
overtook
him
at
cowley
the
two
boats
were
in
the
lock
thomas
and
a
lady
presumably
his
wife
were
ashore
on
the
raised
cabin
cover
was
a
baby
two
boys
were
respectively
at
the
and
tillers
the
lady
was
attending
to
the
horse
the
water
in
the
lock
rose
gradually
to
a
higher
level
hold
them
tillers
straight
yelled
thomas
at
which
point
i
saluted
him
he
was
a
little
blank
at
first
but
when
i
reminded
him
of
our
last
meeting
his
face
lit
up
at
once
why
you
the
mister
wot
nuppie
came
in
a
shrill
scream
from
the
lady
with
the
horse
nuppie
yes
ada
answered
the
boy
on
the
liz
ai
tied
to
the
can
want
to
be
drownded
did
i
tell
you
to
be
sure
and
tie
her
up
tight
so
i
did
ada
she
untied
herself
again
yes
she
she
albert
this
appeal
for
corroboration
was
directed
to
the
other
small
boy
on
the
it
failed
signally
no
you
did
not
tie
liz
to
the
chimney
you
know
you
never
nuppie
wait
till
we
get
out
of
this
lock
said
nuppie
earnestly
the
water
pouring
in
from
the
northern
sluice
was
forcing
the
tillers
violently
against
the
southern
sluice
gates
if
them
boys
said
tom
blake
in
an
overwrought
voice
lets
them
tillers
go
round
it
all
up
with
my
pair
o
boats
lem
me
do
it
you
the
rest
of
the
sentence
was
mercifully
lost
in
the
thump
with
which
thomas
feet
bounded
on
the
he
made
liz
fast
to
the
circular
foot
of
iron
chimney
projecting
from
the
boards
then
jumping
back
to
the
land
he
said
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
lazy
little
brats
an
they
their
tea
too
clear
of
the
locks
i
walked
with
thomas
and
his
ancient
horse
trying
to
explain
what
i
wanted
done
but
it
was
not
until
we
had
tied
up
for
the
night
had
had
beer
at
the
shovel
and
nuppie
and
albert
being
safely
asleep
in
the
second
cabin
had
met
at
supper
that
my
instructions
had
been
fully
grasped
thomas
himself
was
inclined
to
be
diffident
and
had
it
not
been
for
ada
would
i
think
have
let
my
offer
slide
she
was
enthusiastic
it
was
she
who
told
me
of
the
cottage
they
had
at
fenny
stratford
which
they
used
as
headquarters
whilst
waiting
for
a
cargo
that
can
be
used
as
a
permanent
address
i
said
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
write
your
name
at
the
end
of
each
typewritten
sheet
enclose
it
in
the
stamped
envelope
which
i
will
send
you
and
send
it
by
post
when
the
cheques
come
sign
them
on
the
back
and
forward
them
to
me
for
every
ten
pounds
you
forward
me
i
give
you
one
for
yourself
in
any
difficulty
simply
write
to
me
here
my
own
address
and
i
see
you
through
it
we
ca
go
to
prison
for
it
can
we
mister
asked
ada
suddenly
after
a
pause
no
i
said
there
nothing
dishonest
in
what
i
propose
oh
she
did
so
much
mean
that
said
thomas
thoughtfully
they
gave
me
a
shakedown
for
the
night
in
the
cargo
just
before
turning
in
i
said
casually
if
anyone
except
me
cashed
the
cheques
by
mistake
he
go
to
prison
quick
yes
mister
came
back
thomas
voice
again
a
shade
thoughtfully
modulated
chapter
eva
eversleigh
james
orlebar
cloyster
narrative
continued
with
my
system
thus
in
full
swing
i
experienced
the
intoxication
of
assured
freedom
to
say
i
was
elated
does
not
describe
it
i
walked
on
air
this
was
my
state
of
mind
when
i
determined
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
i
had
known
them
in
my
college
days
but
since
i
had
been
engaged
in
literature
i
had
sedulously
avoided
them
because
i
remembered
that
margaret
had
once
told
me
they
were
her
friends
but
now
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
fear
them
on
that
account
and
thinking
that
the
solid
comfort
of
their
house
in
kensington
would
be
far
from
disagreeable
thither
one
afternoon
in
spring
i
made
my
way
it
is
wonderful
how
friendly
convention
is
to
art
when
art
does
not
appear
to
want
to
borrow
money
no
kensington
lane
is
the
stronghold
of
british
respectability
it
is
more
respectable
than
the
most
respectable
suburb
its
attitude
to
mayfair
is
that
of
a
mother
to
a
daughter
who
has
gone
on
the
stage
and
made
a
success
kensington
lane
is
almost
tolerant
of
mayfair
but
not
quite
it
admits
the
success
but
shakes
its
head
took
an
early
opportunity
of
drawing
me
aside
and
began
gently
to
pump
me
after
i
had
responded
with
sufficient
docility
to
her
leads
she
reiterated
her
delight
at
seeing
me
again
i
had
concluded
my
replies
with
the
words
i
am
a
struggling
journalist
mrs
cresswell
i
accompanied
the
phrase
with
a
which
she
took
to
mean
as
i
intended
she
should
that
i
was
amusing
myself
by
dabbling
in
literature
backed
by
a
small
but
adequate
private
income
oh
come
james
she
said
smiling
approvingly
you
know
you
will
make
a
quite
too
dreadfully
clever
success
how
dare
you
try
to
deceive
me
like
that
a
struggling
journalist
indeed
but
i
knew
she
liked
that
struggling
journalist
immensely
she
would
couple
me
and
my
own
epithet
together
before
her
friends
she
would
enjoy
unconsciously
an
imperceptible
but
exquisite
sensation
of
patronage
by
having
me
at
her
house
even
if
she
discussed
me
with
margaret
i
was
safe
for
margaret
would
give
an
altogether
different
interpretation
of
the
smile
with
which
i
described
myself
as
struggling
my
smile
would
be
mentally
catalogued
by
her
as
brave
for
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
as
suddenly
as
my
name
had
achieved
a
little
publicity
just
so
suddenly
had
it
utterly
disappeared
towards
the
end
of
may
it
happened
that
julian
dropped
into
my
rooms
about
three
and
found
me
gazing
critically
at
a
i
seen
you
he
remarked
rather
often
in
that
lately
it
perhaps
losing
its
first
gloss
i
answered
inspecting
my
hat
closely
i
cared
not
a
bit
for
julian
sneers
for
the
smell
of
the
of
kensington
had
laid
hold
of
my
soul
and
i
was
resolved
to
make
the
most
of
the
respite
which
my
system
gave
me
what
salon
is
to
have
the
honour
today
he
asked
spreading
himself
on
my
sofa
i
going
to
the
i
replied
julian
slowly
sat
up
ah
he
said
conversationally
i
been
asked
to
meet
their
niece
a
miss
eversleigh
whom
invited
to
stop
with
them
funny
by
the
way
that
her
name
should
be
the
same
as
yours
not
particularly
said
julian
shortly
she
my
cousin
my
cousin
eva
this
was
startling
there
was
a
pause
presently
julian
said
do
you
know
jimmy
that
if
i
were
not
the
philosopher
i
am
i
curse
this
awful
indolence
of
mine
i
saw
it
in
a
flash
and
went
up
to
him
holding
out
my
hand
in
sympathy
thanks
he
said
gripping
it
but
do
speak
of
it
i
could
endure
that
even
from
you
james
it
too
hard
for
talking
if
it
was
only
myself
whose
life
i
spoilt
if
it
was
only
myself
he
broke
off
and
then
hers
too
she
true
as
steel
i
had
heard
no
more
bitter
cry
than
that
i
began
to
busy
myself
amongst
some
manuscripts
to
give
julian
time
to
compose
himself
and
so
an
hour
passed
at
a
quarter
past
four
i
got
up
to
go
out
julian
lay
recumbent
it
seemed
terrible
to
leave
him
brooding
alone
over
his
misery
a
closer
inspection
however
showed
me
he
was
asleep
meanwhile
eva
eversleigh
and
i
became
firm
friends
of
her
person
i
need
simply
say
that
it
was
the
most
beautiful
that
nature
ever
created
pressed
as
to
details
i
should
add
that
she
was
dark
had
brown
hair
very
big
blue
eyes
a
nose
and
a
rather
wide
mouth
julian
had
said
she
was
true
as
steel
therefore
i
felt
no
diffidence
in
manoeuvring
myself
into
her
society
on
every
conceivable
occasion
sometimes
she
spoke
to
me
of
julian
whom
i
admitted
i
knew
and
with
feminine
courage
she
hid
her
hopeless
affection
for
her
cousin
under
the
cloak
of
ingenuous
levity
she
laughed
nearly
every
time
his
name
was
mentioned
about
this
time
the
gave
a
dance
i
looked
forward
to
it
with
almost
painful
pleasure
i
had
not
been
to
a
dance
since
my
last
at
cambridge
also
no
kensington
lane
had
completely
usurped
the
position
i
had
previously
assigned
to
paradise
to
waltz
with
julian
cousin
that
was
the
ambition
which
now
dwarfed
my
former
hankering
for
the
fame
of
authorship
or
a
habitation
in
bohemia
goodwin
once
said
that
happiness
consists
in
anticipating
an
impossible
future
be
that
as
it
may
i
certainly
thought
my
sensations
were
pleasant
enough
when
at
length
my
hansom
pulled
up
jerkily
beside
the
steps
of
no
kensington
lane
as
i
paid
the
fare
i
could
hear
the
murmur
from
within
of
a
waltz
tune
and
i
kept
repeating
to
myself
that
eva
had
promised
me
the
privilege
of
taking
her
in
to
supper
and
had
given
me
the
last
two
waltzes
and
the
first
two
extras
i
went
to
pay
my
to
my
hostess
she
was
supinely
gamesome
ah
she
said
showing
her
excellent
teeth
genius
attendant
at
the
revels
of
terpsichore
where
beauty
i
responded
cutting
it
as
though
mutton
thick
teaches
the
humblest
visitor
the
reigning
muse
art
you
may
have
this
one
if
you
like
said
simply
supper
came
at
last
and
with
supper
eva
i
must
now
write
it
down
that
she
was
not
a
type
of
english
beauty
she
was
not
i
mean
queenly
impassive
tonight
for
instance
her
eyes
were
as
i
had
never
seen
them
there
danced
in
them
the
merriest
glitter
which
was
more
than
a
mere
glorification
of
the
ordinary
merry
glitter
which
scores
of
girls
possess
at
every
ball
to
begin
with
there
was
a
diabolical
abandon
in
eva
glitter
which
raised
it
instantly
above
the
common
herd
and
behind
it
all
was
that
very
misty
mist
i
do
know
whether
all
men
have
seen
that
mist
but
i
am
sure
that
no
man
has
seen
it
more
than
once
and
from
what
i
seen
of
the
average
man
i
doubt
if
most
of
them
have
ever
seen
it
at
all
well
there
it
was
for
me
to
see
in
eva
eversleigh
eyes
that
night
at
supper
it
made
me
think
of
things
unspeakable
i
felt
a
rush
of
classic
aestheticism
arcadia
helen
of
troy
the
happy
valleys
of
the
early
greeks
supper
i
believe
i
gave
her
oyster
but
i
was
far
away
deep
deep
deep
in
eva
eyes
i
saw
a
craft
sighting
a
cloudless
azure
sky
the
dark
blue
symplegades
heard
in
my
ears
the
jargon
loud
and
near
me
of
the
sailors
and
faintly
the
distance
of
the
sea
rose
intermittently
the
sound
of
at
the
clashing
rocks
as
we
sat
there
she
smiled
across
the
table
at
me
with
such
perfect
friendliness
it
seemed
as
though
a
magic
barrier
separated
our
two
selves
from
all
the
chattering
rustling
crowd
around
us
when
she
spoke
a
little
quiver
of
feeling
blended
adorably
with
the
low
sweet
tones
of
her
voice
we
talked
indeed
of
trifles
but
with
just
that
charming
hint
of
intimacy
which
men
friends
have
who
may
have
known
one
another
from
birth
and
may
know
one
another
for
a
lifetime
but
never
become
bores
never
change
only
when
it
comes
between
a
woman
and
a
man
it
is
incomparably
finer
it
is
the
talk
of
course
of
lovers
who
have
not
realised
they
are
in
love
the
two
last
waltzes
i
murmured
when
parting
with
her
she
nodded
i
roamed
the
rooms
awaiting
them
she
danced
those
two
last
waltzes
with
strangers
the
thing
was
utterly
beyond
me
at
the
time
looking
back
i
am
still
amazed
to
what
lengths
deliberate
coquetry
can
go
she
actually
took
pains
to
elude
me
and
gave
those
waltzes
to
strangers
from
being
comfortably
rocked
in
the
dark
blue
waters
of
a
grecian
sea
i
was
suddenly
transported
to
the
realities
of
the
ballroom
my
theoretical
love
for
eva
was
now
a
substantial
truth
i
was
in
an
agony
of
desire
in
a
frenzy
of
jealousy
i
wanted
to
hurl
the
two
strangers
to
opposite
corners
of
the
ballroom
but
civilisation
forbade
it
i
was
now
in
an
altogether
indescribable
state
of
nerves
and
suspense
had
she
definitely
and
for
some
unfathomable
reason
decided
to
cut
me
the
first
extra
drew
languorously
to
a
close
couples
swept
from
the
room
to
the
grounds
the
gallery
or
the
conservatory
i
tried
to
steady
my
whirling
head
with
a
cigarette
and
a
in
the
the
orchestra
like
a
train
starting
tentatively
on
a
long
run
launched
itself
mildly
into
the
preliminary
bars
of
i
sought
the
ballroom
blinded
by
my
feelings
pulling
myself
together
with
an
effort
i
saw
her
standing
alone
it
struck
me
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
clothed
in
cream
her
skin
gleamed
shining
white
she
stood
erect
her
arms
by
her
sides
behind
her
was
a
huge
black
velvet
of
many
folds
supported
by
two
dull
brazen
columns
as
i
advanced
towards
her
two
or
three
men
bowed
and
spoke
to
her
she
smiled
and
dismissed
them
and
still
smiling
pleasantly
her
glance
traversed
the
crowd
and
rested
upon
me
i
was
drawing
now
quite
near
her
eyes
met
mine
nor
did
she
avert
them
and
stooping
a
little
to
address
her
i
heard
her
sigh
you
tired
i
said
forgetting
my
two
last
dances
forgetting
everything
but
that
i
loved
her
perhaps
i
am
she
said
taking
my
arm
we
turned
in
silence
to
the
and
found
ourselves
in
the
hall
the
doors
were
opened
some
servants
were
there
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
i
chanced
to
see
a
yellow
light
find
out
if
that
cab
engaged
i
said
to
a
footman
the
cool
air
i
said
to
eva
the
cab
is
not
engaged
sir
said
the
footman
returning
yes
said
eva
in
answer
to
my
glance
drive
to
the
corner
of
sloane
street
by
way
of
the
park
i
told
the
driver
i
have
said
that
i
had
forgotten
everything
except
that
i
loved
her
could
it
help
remembrance
now
that
we
two
sped
alone
through
empty
streets
her
warm
palpitating
body
touching
mine
julian
his
friendship
for
me
his
love
for
eva
margaret
and
her
love
for
me
my
own
honour
these
things
were
blotted
from
my
brain
eva
i
murmured
and
i
took
her
hand
eva
her
wonderful
eyes
met
mine
the
mist
in
them
seemed
to
turn
to
dew
my
darling
she
whispered
very
low
and
the
road
being
deserted

drew
her
face
to
mine
and
kissed

is
any
man
really
honourable
i
wonder
hundreds
thousands
go
triumphantly
through
life
with
that
reputation
but
how
far
is
this
due
to
absence
of
temptation
life
which
is
like
cricket
in
so
many
ways
resembles
the
game
in
this
also
a
batsman
makes
a
century
and
having
made
it
is
bowled
by
a
ball
which
he
is
utterly
unable
to
play
what
if
that
ball
had
come
at
the
beginning
of
his
innings
instead
of
at
the
end
of
it
men
go
through
life
without
a
stain
on
their
honour
i
wonder
if
it
simply
means
that
they
had
the
luck
not
to
have
the
good
ball
bowled
to
them
early
in
their
innings
to
take
my
own
case
i
had
always
considered
myself
a
man
of
honour
i
had
a
code
that
was
rigid
compared
with
that
of
a
large
number
of
men
in
theory
i
should
never
have
swerved
from
it
i
was
fully
prepared
to
carry
out
my
promise
and
marry
margaret
at
the
expense
of
my
happiness
until
i
met
eva
i
would
have
done
anything
to
avoid
injuring
julian
my
friend
until
i
met
eva
eva
was
my
temptation
and
i
fell
nothing
in
the
world
mattered
so
that
she
was
mine
i
ought
to
have
had
a
revulsion
of
feeling
as
i
walked
back
to
my
rooms
in
walpole
street
the
dance
was
over
the
music
had
ceased
the
dawn
was
chill
and
at
a
point
midway
between
kensington
lane
and
the
brompton
oratory
i
had
proposed
to
eversleigh
cousin
his
eva
true
as
steel
and
had
been
accepted
yet
i
had
no
remorse
i
did
not
even
try
to
justify
my
behaviour
to
julian
or
to
margaret
or
for
she
must
suffer
too
to
who
i
knew
well
was
socially
ambitious
for
her
niece
to
all
these
things
i
was
indifferent
i
repeated
softly
to
myself
we
love
each
other
from
this
state
of
coma
however
i
was
aroused
by
the
appearance
of
my
i
saw
in
fact
that
my
room
was
illuminated
remembering
that
i
had
been
careful
to
put
out
my
lamp
before
i
left
i
feared
as
i
opened
the
hall
door
a
troublesome
encounter
with
a
mad
housebreaker
mad
for
no
room
such
as
mine
could
attract
a
burglar
who
has
even
the
slightest
pretensions
to
sanity
it
was
not
a
burglar
it
was
julian
eversleigh
and
he
was
lying
asleep
on
my
sofa
there
was
nothing
peculiar
in
this
i
roused
him
julian
i
said
i
glad
you
back
he
said
sitting
up
i
some
news
for
you
so
have
i
said
i
for
i
had
resolved
to
tell
him
what
i
had
done
hear
mine
first
it
urgent
miss
margaret
goodwin
has
been
here
my
heart
seemed
to
leap
today
i
cried
yes
i
had
called
to
see
you
and
was
waiting
a
little
while
on
the
chance
of
your
coming
in
when
i
happened
to
look
out
of
the
window
a
girl
was
coming
down
the
street
looking
at
the
numbers
of
the
houses
she
stopped
here
intuition
told
me
she
was
miss
goodwin
while
she
was
ringing
the
bell
i
did
all
i
could
to
increase
the
shabby
squalor
of
your
room
she
was
shown
in
here
and
i
introduced
myself
as
your
friend
we
chatted
i
drew
an
agonising
picture
of
your
struggle
for
existence
you
were
brave
talented
and
unsuccessful
though
you
went
often
hungry
you
had
a
plucky
smile
upon
your
lips
it
was
a
meritorious
bit
of
work
miss
goodwin
cried
a
good
deal
she
is
charming
i
was
so
sorry
for
her
that
i
laid
it
on
all
the
thicker
where
is
she
now
nearing
guernsey
she
gone
gone
i
said
without
seeing
me
i
do
understand
you
do
understand
how
she
loves
you
james
but
she
gone
gone
without
a
word
she
has
gone
because
she
loved
you
so
she
had
intended
to
stay
with
the
she
knows
them
it
seems
they
did
know
she
was
coming
she
did
know
herself
until
this
morning
she
happened
to
be
walking
on
the
quay
at
peter
port
the
boat
was
on
the
point
of
starting
for
england
a
wave
of
affection
swept
over
miss
goodwin
she
felt
she
must
see
you
scribbling
a
note
which
she
despatched
to
her
mother
she
went
aboard
she
came
straight
here
then
when
i
had
finished
with
her
when
i
had
lied
consistently
about
you
for
an
hour
she
told
me
she
must
return
must
not
see
james
she
said
have
torn
my
heart
i
should
break
down
and
she
said
speaking
i
think
half
to
herself
courage
is
so
noble
so
different
from
mine
and
i
must
not
impose
a
needless
strain
upon
it
you
shall
not
see
me
weep
for
you
and
then
she
went
away
julian
voice
broke
he
was
genuinely
affected
by
his
own
recital
for
my
part
i
saw
that
i
had
bludgeon
work
to
do
it
is
childish
to
grumble
at
the
part
fate
forces
one
to
play
sympathetic
or
otherwise
one
can
only
enact
one
to
the
utmost
of
one
ability
mine
was
now
essentially
unsympathetic
but
i
was
determined
that
it
should
be
adequately
played
i
went
to
the
fireplace
and
poked
the
fire
into
a
blaze
then
throwing
my
hat
on
the
table
and
lighting
a
cigarette
i
regarded
julian
cynically
you
a
nice
sort
of
person
are
you
i
said
what
do
you
mean
asked
julian
startled
as
i
had
meant
that
he
should
be
by
the
question
i
laughed
are
you
just
a
little
transparent
my
dear
julian
he
stared
blankly
i
took
up
a
position
in
front
of
the
fire
disloyalty
i
said
tolerantly
where
a
woman
is
concerned
is
in
the
eyes
of
some
people
almost
a
negative
virtue
i
do
know
what
on
earth
you
talking
about
do
you
i
was
sorry
for
him
all
the
time
in
a
curiously
impersonal
way
i
could
realise
the
depths
to
which
i
was
sinking
in
putting
this
insult
upon
him
but
my
better
feelings
were
gagged
and
bound
that
night
the
one
thought
uppermost
in
my
mind
was
that
i
must
tell
julian
of
eva
and
that
by
his
story
of
margaret
he
had
given
me
an
opening
for
making
my
confession
with
the
minimum
of
discomfort
to
myself
it
was
pitiful
to
see
the
first
shaft
of
my
insinuation
slowly
sink
into
him
i
could
see
by
the
look
in
his
eyes
that
he
had
grasped
my
meaning
jimmy
he
gasped
you
ca
think
are
you
joking
i
am
not
surprised
at
your
asking
that
question
i
replied
pleasantly
you
know
how
tolerant
i
am
but
i
not
joking
not
that
i
blame
you
my
dear
fellow
margaret
is
or
used
to
be
very
you
seem
to
be
in
earnest
he
said
in
a
dazed
way
my
dear
fellow
i
said
i
have
a
certain
amount
of
intuition
you
spend
an
hour
here
alone
with
margaret
she
is
young
and
very
pretty
you
are
placed
immediately
on
terms
of
intimacy
by
the
fact
that
you
have
in
myself
a
subject
of
mutual
interest
that
breaks
the
ice
you
are
at
but
your
main
sympathies
are
identical
also
you
have
a
strong
objective
sympathy
for
margaret
i
think
we
may
presuppose
that
this
second
sympathy
is
stronger
than
the
first
it
pivots
on
a
woman
not
on
a
man
and
on
a
woman
who
is
present
not
on
a
man
who
is
absent
you
see
my
meaning
at
any
rate
the
solid
fact
remains
that
she
stayed
an
hour
with
you
whom
she
had
met
for
the
first
time
today
and
did
not
feel
equal
to
meeting
me
whom
she
has
loved
for
two
years
if
you
want
me
to
explain
myself
further
i
have
no
objection
to
doing
so
i
mean
that
you
made
love
to
her
i
watched
him
narrowly
to
see
how
he
would
take
it
the
dazed
expression
deepened
on
his
face
you
are
apparently
sane
he
said
very
wearily
you
seem
to
be
sober
i
am
both
i
said
there
was
a
pause
it
no
use
for
me
he
began
evidently
collecting
his
thoughts
with
a
strong
effort
to
say
your
charge
is
preposterous
i
do
suppose
mere
denial
would
convince
you
i
can
only
say
instead
that
the
charge
is
too
wild
to
be
replied
to
except
in
one
way
which
is
this
employ
for
a
moment
your
own
standard
of
right
and
wrong
i
know
your
love
story
and
you
know
mine
miss
eversleigh
my
cousin
is
to
me
what
miss
goodwin
is
to
you
true
as
steel
my
loyalty
and
my
friendship
for
you
are
the
same
as
your
loyalty
and
your
friendship
for
me
well
well
if
i
have
spent
an
hour
with
miss
goodwin
you
have
spent
more
than
an
hour
with
my
cousin
what
right
have
you
to
suspect
me
more
than
i
have
to
suspect
you
judge
me
by
your
own
standard
i
do
i
said
and
i
find
myself
still
suspecting
you
he
stared
i
do
understand
you
perhaps
you
will
when
you
have
heard
the
piece
of
news
which
i
mentioned
earlier
in
our
conversation
that
i
had
for
you
well
i
proposed
to
your
cousin
at
the
dance
tonight
and
she
accepted
me
the
news
had
a
surprising
effect
on
julian
first
he
blinked
then
he
craned
his
head
forward
in
the
manner
of
a
deaf
man
listening
with
difficulty
then
he
left
the
room
without
a
word
he
had
not
been
gone
two
minutes
when
there
were
three
short
sharp
taps
at
my
window
julian
returned
impossible
yet
who
else
could
have
called
on
me
at
that
hour
i
went
to
the
front
door
and
opened
it
on
the
steps
stood
the
rev
john
hatton
beside
him
sidney
price
and
lurking
in
the
background
tom
blake
of
the
and
end
of
james
orlebar
cloister
narrative
sidney
price
narrative
chapter
a
ghostly
gathering
norah
perkins
is
a
peach
and
i
do
care
who
knows
it
but
all
the
same
there
no
need
to
tell
her
every
little
detail
of
a
man
past
life
not
that
i
been
a
don
far
from
it
costs
a
bit
too
much
that
game
you
simply
ca
do
it
on
sixty
quid
a
year
paid
monthly
and
that
all
there
is
about
it
not
but
what
i
often
think
of
going
it
a
bit
when
things
are
slack
at
the
office
and
my
pal
in
the
new
business
department
is
out
for
lunch
it
the
loneliness
makes
you
think
of
going
a
regular
plunger
more
than
once
when
tommy
milner
has
been
there
to
talk
to
i
tell
you
i
half
a
mind
to
take
out
some
girl
or
other
to
tea
at
the
cabin
i
have
straight
yet
somehow
when
the
assist
cash
comes
round
with
the
wicker
tray
on
the
and
gives
you
the
envelope
price
and
you
take
out
the
five
sovereigns
well
somehow
there
such
a
lot
of
other
things
which
you
do
want
to
buy
but
have
just
got
to
tommy
milner
said
the
other
day
and
i
quite
agree
with
him
when
i
took
my
clean
handkerchief
out
last
fortnight
he
said
i
could
help
totting
up
what
a
lot
i
spend
on
trifles
that
it
there
you
got
it
in
a
nutshell
washing
bootlaces
trifles
in
fact
where
the
coin
goes
only
the
other
morning
i
bust
my
braces
i
was
late
already
and
pinning
them
together
all
but
lost
me
the
only
it
was
a
bit
behind
time
it
struck
me
then
as
i
ran
to
the
station
that
the
average
person
would
never
count
braces
an
expense
trifles
that
what
it
is
no
i
may
have
smoked
a
cig
too
much
and
been
so
chippy
next
day
that
i
had
to
go
out
and
get
a
cup
of
tea
at
the
or
i
may
now
and
again
have
gone
up
west
of
an
evening
for
a
bit
of
a
look
round
but
beyond
that
i
never
been
really
what
you
call
vicious
very
likely
it
been
my
friendship
for
hatton
that
curbed
me
breaking
out
as
i
sometimes
imagined
myself
doing
when
i
been
alone
in
the
new
business
room
though
i
must
say
in
common
honesty
to
myself
that
there
always
been
the
fear
of
getting
the
sack
from
the
moon
the
moon
is
like
some
other
insurance
companies
i
could
mention
which
take
anyone
your
refs
must
be
or
you
do
stand
an
earthly
simply
not
an
earthly
besides
the
moon
is
an
insurance
company
at
all
it
an
company
of
course
now
chucked
the
moon
shot
the
moon
as
tommy
milner
who
the
office
comic
put
it
and
taken
to
literature
i
could
do
pretty
well
what
i
liked
if
it
were
for
norah
which
brings
me
back
to
what
i
was
saying
just
now
that
i
not
sure
whether
i
shall
tell
her
the
past
i
may
and
i
may
not
i
have
to
think
it
over
anyway
i
going
to
write
it
down
first
and
see
how
it
looks
if
it
all
right
it
can
go
into
my
autobiography
if
it
is
then
i
shall
lie
low
about
it
that
the
posish
it
all
started
from
my
friendship
with
hatton
the
rev
hatton
if
it
had
have
been
for
that
man
i
should
still
be
working
out
rates
of
percentage
for
the
moon
and
listening
to
tommy
milner
witticisms
of
course
i
cut
him
now
a
literary
man
a
man
who
supplies
the
with
two
columns
of
social
interludes
at
a
salary
i
not
going
to
mention
in
case
norah
gets
to
hear
of
it
and
wants
to
lash
out
a
man
whose
society
novels
are
competed
for
by
every
publisher
in
london
and
new
york
well
can
a
man
in
that
position
be
expected
to
keep
up
with
an
impudent
little
like
tommy
milner
it
ca
be
done
i
first
met
the
reverend
on
the
top
of
box
hill
one
saturday
afternoon
bike
had
punctured
and
the
reverend
gave
me
the
loan
of
his
cyclists
repairing
outfit
we
had
our
tea
together
watercress
and
two
sorts
of
jam
one
bob
per
head
he
issued
an
invite
to
his
diggings
in
the
temple
cocoa
and
cigs
of
an
evening
regular
pally
him
and
me
was
then
he
got
into
the
way
of
taking
me
down
to
a
boys
club
that
he
had
started
terrors
they
were
so
to
put
it
fair
terrors
but
they
all
thought
a
lot
of
the
reverend
and
so
did
consequently
it
was
all
right
the
next
link
in
the
chain
was
a
chap
called
cloyster
james
orlebar
cloyster
the
reverend
brought
him
down
to
teach
boxing
for
my
own
part
i
do
fancy
anything
in
the
way
of
brutality
the
club
so
i
thought
had
got
on
very
nicely
with
more
intellectual
pursuits
draughts
chess
bagatelle
and
but
the
rev
wanted
boxing
and
boxing
it
had
to
be
not
that
it
would
have
done
for
him
or
me
to
have
mixed
ourselves
up
in
it
he
had
his
congregation
to
consider
and
i
am
often
on
duty
at
the
downstairs
counter
before
the
very
heart
of
the
public
a
black
eye
or
a
missing
tooth
would
have
done
at
all
for
either
of
us
being
as
we
were
in
a
sense
officials
but
cloyster
never
seemed
to
realise
this
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
cloyster
was
not
my
idea
of
a
gentleman
he
had
no
tact
the
next
link
was
a
confirmed
dipsomaniac
a
terrible
phrase
unavoidable
though
a
very
evil
man
is
tom
blake
yet
out
of
evil
cometh
good
and
it
was
tom
blake
who
indirectly
stopped
the
boxing
lessons
the
club
boys
never
wore
the
gloves
after
drunken
visit
i
shall
never
no
positively
never
forget
that
night
in
june
when
matters
came
to
a
head
in
shaftesbury
avenue
oh
i
say
it
was
a
bit
hot
very
warm
each
successive
phase
is
limned
indelibly
that
the
sort
of
literary
style
i
got
if
wanted
on
the
tablets
of
my
memory
i
been
up
west
and
who
should
i
run
across
in
oxford
street
but
my
old
friend
charlie
cookson
very
good
company
is
charlie
cookson
see
him
at
a
shilling
hop
at
the
holborn
he
pretty
much
all
there
all
the
time
follower
of
course
purely
as
an
amateur
of
the
late
dan
leno
king
of
comedians
good
penetrating
voice
writes
his
own
bits
you
know
what
i
mean
the
funny
observations
on
motors
and
marriage
marked
spoken
in
the
fellows
often
tell
him
he
make
a
mint
of
money
in
the
halls
and
there
a
rumour
flying
round
among
us
who
knew
him
in
the
moon
that
he
was
seen
coming
out
of
a
bedford
street
variety
agency
the
other
day
well
i
met
charlie
at
something
after
ten
directly
he
spotted
me
he
was
at
his
antics
standing
stock
still
on
the
pavement
in
a
crouching
attitude
and
grasping
his
umbrella
like
a
tomahawk
his
always
but
he
the
sort
of
fellow
who
does
care
a
blow
what
he
does
chronic
in
that
respect
absolutely
the
could
think
what
he
was
up
to
that
what
he
said
he
did
straight
only
it
i
thought
it
was
going
a
bit
too
far
in
a
public
place
so
to
show
him
i
just
said
good
evening
cookson
how
are
you
this
evening
with
all
his
entertaining
ways
he
sometimes
slow
at
taking
a
hint
no
tact
if
you
see
what
i
mean
in
this
case
for
instance
he
answered
at
the
top
of
his
voice
bolly
golly
yah
and
pretended
to
scalp
me
with
his
umbrella
i
immediately
ducked
and
somehow
knocked
my
bowler
against
his
elbow
he
caught
it
as
it
was
falling
off
my
head
then
he
said
indian
brave
give
little
pale
face
chief
his
hat
this
was
really
too
much
and
i
felt
relieved
when
a
policeman
told
us
to
move
on
charlie
said
come
and
have
two
of
something
well
we
stayed
chatting
over
our
drinks
in
fact
i
was
well
into
my
second
lemon
and
dash
at
the
stockwood
hotel
until
nearly
eleven
at
five
to
charlie
said
because
he
was
living
in
and
i
walked
out
into
the
charing
cross
road
meaning
to
turn
down
shaftesbury
avenue
so
as
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
outside
the
oxford
there
was
a
bit
of
a
crowd
i
asked
a
man
standing
outside
a
tobacconist
what
the
trouble
was
says
he
wo
go
away
without
kissing
the
girl
that
sang

was
the
reply

i
had
gone
out
of
curiosity
to
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
and
before
i
knew
what
had
happened
i
found
myself
close
to
the
centre
of
it
a
large
man
in
dirty
corduroys
stood
with
his
back
to
me
his
shape
seemed
strangely
familiar
still
singing
and
swaying
to
horrible
angles
all
over
the
shop
he
slowly
pivoted
round
in
a
moment
i
recognised
the
bleary
features
of
tom
blake
at
the
same
time
he
recognised
me
he
stretched
out
a
long
arm
and
seized
me
by
the
shoulder
oh
he
sobbed
i
thought
i
no
friend
in
the
wide
world
except
but
now
i
got
yew
it
orlright
yus
yus
orlright
a
murmur
almost
a
cheer
it
was
circulated
among
the
crowd
but
a
policeman
stepped
up
to
me
now
then
said
the
policeman
wot
all
this
about
yew

the
wuns
she

shouted
blake
ho

blake

blake

we
bosum
fren
ai
we
old
dear
said
blake
linking
his
arm
in
mine
and
dragging
me
away
with
him
behind
us
the
policeman
was
shunting
the
spectators
oh
it
was
excessively
displeasing
to
any
man
of
culture
i
can
assure
you
how
we
got
along
shaftesbury
i
do
know
it
a
subject
i
do
not
care
to
think
about
by
leaning
heavily
on
my
shoulder
and
using
me
so
to
speak
as
ballast
drunken
blake
just
managed
to
make
progress
i
can
not
say
unostentatiously
but
at
any
rate
not
so
noticeably
as
to
be
taken
into
custody
i
did
know
mind
you
where
we
were
going
to
and
i
did
know
when
we
were
going
to
stop
in
this
frightful
manner
of
progression
we
had
actually
gained
sight
of
piccadilly
circus
when
all
of
a
sudden
a
voice
hissed
in
my
ear
sidney
price
i
am
disappointed
in
you
hissed
mind
you
i
tell
you
i
jumped
thought
i
bitten
my
tongue
off
at
first
if
drunken
blake
had
been
clutching
me
so
tight
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
bowled
me
over
clean
it
startled
blake
a
goodish
bit
too
all
along
the
avenue
he
been
making
just
a
quiet
sort
of
snivelling
noise
crikey
if
he
did
speak
up
quite
perky
o
my
fren
he
says
so
drunk
and
yet
so
young
meaning
me
if
you
please
it
was
too
thick
you
blighter
i
says
you
blighter
you
talk
to
me
like
that
let
go
of
my
arm
and
see
me
knock
you
down
i
must
have
been
a
bit
excited
you
see
to
say
that
then
i
looked
round
to
see
who
the
other
individual
was
you
hardly
credit
me
when
i
tell
you
it
was
the
reverend
but
it
was
honest
truth
it
was
the
rev
john
hatton
and
no
error
his
face
fairly
frightened
me
simply
blazing
red
fair
scarlet
he
kept
by
the
side
of
us
and
let
me
have
it
all
he
could
i
thought
you
knew
better
price
that
what
he
said
i
thought
you
knew
better
here
are
you
a
friend
of
mine
a
member
of
the
club
a
man
i
trusted
going
about
the
streets
of
london
in
a
bestial
state
of
disgusting
intoxication
that
enough
in
itself
but
you
done
worse
than
that
you
lured
poor
blake
into
intemperance
yes
with
all
your
advantages
of
education
and
you
deliberately
set
to
work
to
put
temptation
in
the
way
of
poor
weak
blake
drunkenness
is
blake
besetting
sin
and
you
blake
had
been
silently
wagging
his
head
as
pleased
as
punch
at
being
called
hardworking
but
here
he
shoved
in
his
oar
dare
yer
he
burst
out
i
ai
never
tasted
a
drop
o
beer
in
my
natural
born
an
bred
teetotal
that
wot
i
was
and
do
yew
forget
it
neither
blake
said
the
reverend
that
not
the
truth
call
me
a
drunkard
do
yer
replied
blake
go
on
say
it
again
say
i
a
blarsted
liar
wo
yer
orlright
then
i
shall
run
away
and
with
that
he
wrenched
himself
away
from
me
and
set
off
towards
the
circus
he
was
trying
to
run
but
his
advance
took
the
form
of
sweeps
all
over
the
pavement
he
had
circled
off
so
unexpectedly
that
he
had
gained
some
fifty
yards
before
we
realised
what
was
happening
we
must
stop
him
said
the
reverend
as
i
intoxicated
i
said
coldly
being
a
bit
fed
up
with
things
i
should
recommend
you
stopping
him
mr
hatton
i
done
you
an
injustice
said
the
reverend
you
have
said
blake
was
now
nearing
a
policeman
stop
him
we
both
shouted
starting
to
run
forward
the
policeman
brought
blake
to
a
standstill
friend
of
yours
said
the
constable
when
we
got
up
to
him
yes
said
the
reverend
you
ought
to
look
after
him
better
said
the
constable
well
really
i
like
that
said
the
reverend
but
he
caught
my
eye
and
began
laughing
our
best
plan
he
said
is
to
get
a
and
go
down
to
the
temple
there
some
supper
there
what
do
you
say
i
on
i
said
and
to
the
temple
we
accordingly
journeyed
tom
blake
was
sleepy
and
immobile
we
spread
him
without
hindrance
on
a
sofa
where
he
snored
peacefully
whilst
the
reverend
brought
eggs
and
a
slab
of
bacon
out
of
a
cupboard
in
the
kitchen
he
also
brought
a
and
a
bowl
of
fat
is
your
cooking
anything
extra
good
he
asked
no
hatton
i
answered
rather
stiff
i
never
cooked
anything
in
my
life
i
may
not
be
in
a
very
high
position
in
the
moon
but
i
never
descended
to
menial
work
yet
for
about
five
minutes
after
that
the
reverend
was
too
busy
to
speak
then
he
said
without
turning
his
head
away
from
the
hissing
pan
i
wish
you
do
me
a
favour
price
certainly
i
said
look
in
the
cupboard
and
see
whether
there
are
any
knives
forks
plates
and
a
loaf
and
a
bit
of
butter
will
you
i
looked
and
sure
enough
they
were
there
yes
they
all
here
i
called
to
him
and
is
there
a
tray
yes
there
a
tray
now
it
a
funny
thing
that
my
laundress
he
shouted
back
bring
in
breakfast
things
for
more
than
one
on
that
particular
tray
she
always
complaining
it
too
small
and
says
i
ought
to
buy
a
bigger
one
nonsense
i
exclaimed
she
quite
wrong
about
that
you
watch
what
i
can
carry
in
one
load
and
i
packed
the
tray
with
everything
he
had
mentioned
what
price
that
i
said
putting
the
whole
boiling
on
the
table
the
reverend
began
to
roar
with
laughter
it
ridiculous
he
chuckled
i
shall
tell
her
it
ridiculous
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
shortly
after
we
had
supper
previously
having
aroused
blake
the
drunken
fellow
seemed
completely
restored
by
his
repose
he
ate
more
than
his
share
of
the
eggs
and
bacon
and
drank
five
cups
of
tea
then
he
stretched
himself
lit
a
clay
pipe
and
offered
us
his
tobacco
box
from
which
the
reverend
filled
his
briar
i
remained
true
to
my
packet
of
queen
of
the
harem
i
shall
think
twice
before
chucking
up
cig
smoking
as
long
as
queen
of
the
harem
do
go
above
per
ten
we
were
sitting
there
smoking
in
front
of
the
fire
it
was
a
shade
parky
for
the
time
of
year
and
not
talking
a
great
deal
when
the
reverend
said
to
blake
things
are
looking
up
on
the
canal
they
tom
no
said
blake
things
ai
lookin
up
on
the
canal

a
little
house

the
reverend
to
spend
when
you
feel
like
it

said
the
other
i
ai
got
no
property
to
spend
ah
said
the
reverend
cheesing
it
and
sucking
his
pipe
dessay
yer
think
i
free
with
the
rhino
said
blake
after
a
while
i
was
only
wondering
said
the
reverend
blake
stared
first
at
the
reverend
and
then
at
me
ever
remember
a
party
of
the
name
of
cloyster
james
orlebar
cloyster
he
inquired
yes
we
both
said
a
good
man
said
blake

giving
you
money
asked
the
reverend
put
me
into
the
way
of
earning
it
it
the
sorfest
job
ever
i
struck
told
me
not
to
say
nothin
and
i
said
as
i
would
but
it
ai
fair
to
cloyster
not
keeping
of
it
dark
ai
yew
do
know
what
a
noble
that
man
got
an
if
you
were
of
i
could
have
told
you
but
as
you
are
fren
of
as
all
fren
of
i
take
it
on
myself
to
tell
you
wot
that
man
is
giving
me
money
for
blowed
if
shall
his
bloomin
light
under
a
blanky
bushel
any
longer
and
then
he
explained
that
for
putting
his
name
to
a
sheet
or
two
of
paper
and
addressing
a
few
envelopes
he
was
getting
more
money
than
he
knew
what
to
do
with
mind
you
he
said
i
play
it
fair
i
only
take
wot
he
says
i
to
take
the
rest
goes
to
my
old
missus
sees
to
all
that
part
of
it
she
quicker
at
figures
nor
wot
i
am
while
he
was
speaking
i
could
hardly
contain
myself
the
reverend
was
listening
so
carefully
to
every
word
that
i
kept
myself
from
interrupting
but
when
he
got
it
off
his
chest
i
clutched
the
reverend
arm
and
said
what
it
mean
ca
say
said
he
knitting
his
brows
is
he
straight
i
said
all
on
the
jump
i
hope
so
so
you
do
think
there
a
doubt
of
it
i
suppose
not
but
surely
it
very
unselfish
of
you
to
be
so
concerned
over
blake
business
blake
business
be
jiggered
i
said
it
my
business
too
doing
for
mister
james
orlebar
cloyster
exactly
what
blake
doing
and
i
making
money
you
do
understand
on
the
contrary
i
just
beginning
to
understand
you
see
i
doing
for
james
orlebar
cloyster
exactly
the
same
service
as
you
and
blake
and
i
getting
money
from
him
too
chapter
one
in
the
eye
sidney
price
narrative
continued
serpose
i
ought
ter
let
on
that
it
ai
it
from
tom
blake
seemed
to
me
that
if
one
of
the
three
gave
the
show
away
to
the
other
two
the
compact
made
by
each
of
the
other
two
came
to
an
end
automatically
from
myself
the
reason
i
have
broken
my
promise
of
secrecy
is
this
that
determined
we
three
shall
make
a
united
demand
for
a
higher
rate
of
payment
you
of
course
have
your
own
uses
for
the
money
i
need
mine
for
those
humanitarian
objects
for
which
my
whole
life
is
lived
from
the
reverend
wot
said
blake
more
coin
wot
might
thought
o
that
before
i
with
you
sir
said
i
we
entitled
to
a
higher
rate
make
a
memo
to
that
effect
no
no
said
the
reverend
we
can
do
better
than
that
we
three
should
have
a
personal
interview
with
cloyster
and
tell
him
our
decision
when
i
asked
now
at
once
we
are
here
together
and
i
see
no
reason
to
prevent
our
arranging
the
matter
within
the
hour
but
he
be
asleep
i
objected
he
wo
be
asleep
much
longer
yus
roust
outer
bed
that
wot
i
say
wot
for
more
coin
it
was
now
two
in
the
morning
i
missed
the
back
to
brixton
slap
bang
pop
hours
ago
so
i
thought
i
might
just
as
well
make
a
night
of
it
we
jumped
into
our
overcoats
and
hats
and
hurried
to
fleet
street
we
walked
towards
the
strand
until
we
found
a
we
then
drove
to
no
walpole
street
the
clocks
struck
three
as
the
reverend
paid
the
cab
hullo
said
he
why
there
a
light
in
cloyster
he
ca
have
gone
to
bed
yet
his
late
hours
save
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
he
went
up
the
two
or
three
steps
which
led
to
the
front
door
a
glance
at
tom
blake
showed
me
that
the
was
alarmed
he
looked
solemn
and
did
not
speak
i
felt
funny
too
like
when
i
first
handed
round
the
in
our
parish
church
sort
of
empty
feeling
but
the
reverend
was
all
there
spry
and
he
leaned
over
the
area
railing
and
gave
three
short
sharp
taps
on
the
ground
floor
window
with
his
behind
the
lighted
blind
appeared
the
shadow
of
a
man
figure
it
he
it
him
came
respectively
and
simultaneously
from
the
reverend
and
myself
after
a
bit
of
waiting
the
latch
clicked
and
the
door
opened
the
door
was
opened
by
cloyster
himself
he
was
in
evening
dress
and
hysterics
i
thought
i
had
heard
a
rummy
sound
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
could
account
for
it
at
the
time
must
have
been
him
laughing
at
the
sight
of
us
he
tried
to
pull
himself
together
he
half
succeeded
after
a
bit
and
asked
us
to
come
in
to
say
his
room
was
plainly
furnished
does
express
it
the
apartment
was
like
a
prison
cell
i
never
been
in
gaol
of
course
but
i
read
convict
when
it
ran
in
a
serial
the
fire
was
out
the
chairs
were
hard
and
the
whole
thing
was
uncomfortable
never
struck
such
a
shoddy
place
in
my
natural
ever
since
i
called
on
a
man
i
know
slightly
who
was
in
the
hand
of
blood
travelling
company
no
b
delighted
to
see
you
i
sure
said
cloyster
in
fact
i
was
just
going
to
sit
down
and
write
to
you
really
said
the
reverend
well
we
come
of
our
own
accord
and
we
come
to
talk
business
then
turning
to
blake
and
me
he
added
may
i
state
our
case
most
certainly
sir
i
answered
and
blake
gave
a
nod
briefly
then
said
the
reverend
our
mission
is
this
that
we
three
want
our
contracts
revised
what
contracts
said
cloyster
our
contracts
connected
with
your
manuscripts
since
when
have
the
several
matters
of
business
which
i
arranged
privately
with
each
of
you
become
public
tonight
it
was
quite
unavoidable
we
met
by
chance
we
are
not
to
blame
tom
blake
was
yes
he
looks
as
if
he
had
been
our
amended
offer
is
half
profits
more
coin
murmured
blake
huskily
wot
i
regret
that
you
had
your
journey
for
nothing
you
refuse
absolutely
my
dear
cloyster
i
had
expected
you
to
take
this
attitude
but
surely
it
childish
of
you
you
are
bound
to
accede
why
not
do
so
at
once
bound
to
accede
i
do
follow
you
yes
bound
the
present
system
which
you
are
working
is
one
you
can
not
afford
to
destroy
that
is
clear
because
had
it
not
been
so
you
would
never
have
initiated
it
i
do
not
know
for
what
reason
you
were
forced
to
employ
this
system
but
i
do
know
that
powerful
circumstances
must
have
compelled
you
to
do
so
you
are
entirely
in
our
hands
i
said
just
now
i
was
delighted
to
see
you
and
that
i
had
intended
to
ask
you
to
come
to
me
one
by
one
of
course
for
i
had
no
idea
that
the
promise
of
secrecy
which
you
gave
me
had
been
broken
the
reverend
shrugged
his
shoulders
do
you
know
why
i
wanted
to
see
you
no
to
tell
you
that
i
had
decided
to
abandon
my
system
to
notify
you
that
you
would
in
future
receive
no
more
of
my
work
there
was
a
dead
silence
i
think
i
go
home
to
bed
said
the
reverend
blake
and
myself
followed
him
out
cloyster
thanked
us
all
warmly
for
the
excellent
way
in
which
we
had
helped
him
he
said
that
he
was
now
engaged
to
be
married
and
had
to
save
every
penny
otherwise
i
should
have
tried
to
meet
you
in
this
affair
of
the
he
added
that
we
had
omitted
to
congratulate
him
on
his
engagement
his
words
came
faintly
to
our
ears
as
we
tramped
down
walpole
street
nor
did
we
as
far
as
i
can
remember
give
back
any
direct
reply
tell
you
what
it
was
just
like
reminded
me
of
it
even
at
the
time
that
picture
of
napoleon
coming
back
from
moscow
the
reverend
was
napoleon
and
we
were
the
generals
and
if
there
were
three
humpier
men
walking
the
streets
of
london
at
that
moment
i
should
have
liked
to
have
seen
them
chapter
in
the
soup
sidney
price
narrative
continued
they
give
you
a
small
bonus
at
the
moon
if
you
get
through
a
quarter
without
being
late
which
just
shows
the
sort
of
scale
on
which
the
moon
does
things
cookson
down
at
the
oxford
street
emporium
gets
fined
regular
when
he
late
shilling
the
first
hour
and
twopence
every
five
minutes
after
i
known
gentlemen
in
banks
railway
companies
dry
goods
and
woollen
offices
the
indian
trade
jute
tea
every
manner
of
shop
but
they
all
say
the
same
thing
we
are
ruled
by
fear
it
fear
that
drags
them
out
of
bed
in
the
morning
it
fear
that
makes
them
bolt
or
even
miss
their
sausages
it
fear
that
makes
them
run
to
catch
their
train
but
the
moon
method
is
of
a
different
standard
the
moon
does
not
intimidate
no
it
entwines
itself
round
it
insinuates
itself
into
the
hearts
of
its
employees
it
suggests
in
fact
that
we
should
not
be
late
by
offering
us
this
small
bonus
no
insurance
office
and
up
to
the
time
of
writing
no
other
assurance
office
has
been
able
to
boast
as
much
the
same
cause
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
moon
high
reputation
both
inside
and
outside
it
does
things
in
a
big
way
it
spacious
the
moon
timing
system
is
great
too
great
in
its
simplicity
the
regulation
says
you
got
to
be
in
the
office
by
ten
suppose
you
arrive
with
ten
minutes
to
spare
you
go
into
the
outer
office
there
only
one
entrance
the
big
one
in
threadneedle
street
and
find
on
the
side
of
the
circular
counter
a
ledger
the
ledger
is
open
there
is
and
a
quill
pen
beside
it
everyone
name
is
written
in
alphabetical
order
on
the
one
side
of
the
ledger
and
on
the
other
side
there
is
a
blank
page
ruled
down
the
middle
with
a
red
line
having
made
your
appearance
at
ten
to
ten
you
put
your
initials
in
a
line
with
your
name
on
the
page
opposite
and
to
the
left
of
the
division
if
on
the
other
hand
you
missed
your
train
and
do
turn
up
till
ten
minutes
ten
you
got
to
initial
your
name
on
the
other
side
of
the
red
line
in
the
space
on
the
right
of
the
line
a
thick
black
dash
has
been
drawn
by
leach
the
cashier
he
does
this
on
the
last
stroke
of
ten
it
makes
the
page
look
neat
he
says
which
is
quite
right
and
proper
i
see
his
point
of
view
entirely
the
ledger
must
look
decent
in
an
office
like
the
moon
tommy
milner
agrees
with
me
he
says
that
not
only
does
it
look
better
but
it
prevents
unfortunate
mistakes
on
the
part
of
those
who
come
in
late
they
might
forget
and
initial
the
wrong
side
after
ten
the
book
goes
into
leach
private
partition
and
got
to
go
in
there
to
sign
it
was
there
when
i
came
into
the
office
on
the
morning
after
we
been
to
talk
business
with
cloyster
it
had
been
there
about
an
hour
and
a
half
lost
your
bonus
price
my
boy
said
genial
leach
and
the
general
manager
fennell
who
had
stepped
out
of
his
own
room
close
by
heard
him
say
it
i
do
not
imagine
that
price
is
greatly
perturbed
on
that
account
he
will
no
doubt
shortly
be
forsaking
us
for
literature
what
commerce
loses
art
gains
said
the
he
may
have
meant
to
be
funny
or
he
may
not
some
of
those
standing
near
took
him
one
way
others
the
other
some
gravely
bowed
their
heads
others
burst
into
guffaws
the
often
puzzled
his
staff
in
that
way
all
were
anxious
to
do
the
right
thing
by
him
but
he
made
it
so
difficult
to
tell
what
the
right
thing
was
but
as
i
went
down
the
basement
stairs
to
change
my
coat
in
the
clerks
i
understood
from
the
words
how
humiliating
my
position
was
i
had
always
been
a
booky
sort
of
person
at
home
it
had
been
a
standing
joke
that
when
a
boy
i
would
sooner
spend
a
penny
on
than
liquorice
and
it
was
true
not
that
i
disliked
liquorice
i
liked
better
though
so
the
thing
had
gone
on
i
advanced
from
to
hall
caine
and
guy
boothby
and
since
i
had
joined
the
moon
i
had
actually
gone
a
buster
and
bought
in
the
golden
treasury
series
added
to
which
i
had
recently
composed
a
little
lyric
for
a
singer
at
the
moon
annual
smoking
concert
the
lines
were
topical
and
were
descriptive
of
our
complete
compensation
policy
tommy
milner
was
the
vocalist
he
sang
my
composition
to
a
hymn
tune
the
refrain
went
come
and
buy
a
if
you
want
from
the
accidents
which
come
please
plank
down
your
premium
life
is
you
agree
when
you
got
a
the
throne
room
of
the
holborn
fairly
rocked
with
applause
well
it
was
shortly
afterwards
that
i
had
received
a
visit
from
cloyster
the
visit
which
ended
in
my
agreeing
to
sign
whatever
manuscripts
he
sent
me
and
forward
him
all
cheques
for
a
consideration
of
ten
per
cent
softest
job
ever
a
man
had
easy
money
kudos
i
had
almost
too
much
of
it
which
takes
me
back
to
the
remark
about
my
leaving
the
office
since
he
bought
that
big
house
at
park
he
done
a
lot
of
entertaining
at
the
restaurants
his
always
cropping
up
in
the
here
and
there
column
and
naturally
he
a
subscriber
to
the
the
has
everything
of
the
best
and
plenty
of
it
you
do
see
the
with
memo
forms
tucked
round
his
cuffs
he
wears
a
clean
shirt
every
morning
of
his
life
all
people
have
their
little
eccentricities
and
the
the
smartest
goeyest
personalest
weekly
is
never
missing
from
his
every
week
it
there
regular
as
clockwork
that
what
started
my
literary
reputation
among
the
fellows
at
the
moon
cloyster
was
contributing
a
series
of
short
dialogues
to
the
called
in
town
these
on
publication
bore
my
own
signature
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
happened
to
see
the
showing
the
first
of
the
series
to
leach
in
his
private
room
i
kept
it
by
me
and
i
do
wonder
the
news
created
a
bit
of
a
furore
this
was
it
in
town
by
sidney
price
no
the
secrecy
of
the
ballet
you
are
standing
under
the
shelter
of
the
criterion
awning
it
is
of
a
summer
morning
it
is
pouring
in
torrents
a
quick
and
sudden
rain
storm
it
wo
last
long
and
it
does
mean
any
harm
but
what
sport
to
it
is
death
to
you
you
were
touring
the
circus
in
a
new
hat
brand
new
spot
your
tame
cabby
had
a
token
spied
the
cri
awning
dashed
at
it
but
it
leaks
not
so
much
as
the
sky
though
just
enough
however
to
do
your
hat
no
good
you
mention
this
to
friendly

i
know
you
perfectly
gorell
barnes
said
friendly
creature
drop
it
what
the
good
of
the
secrecy
of
the
ballet
if
people
are
going
to
remember
every
single
thing
about
you
at
this
point
the
rain
stops
by
an
adroit
flanking
movement
you
get
away
without
having
to
buy
her
a
lunch
everyone
congratulated
me
always
knew
he
had
it
in
him
found
his
vocation
a
distinctly
clever
head
reaping
in
the
shekels
that
was
the
worst
part
the
moon
to
a
man
was
bent
on
finding
out
how
much
sidney
price
makes
out
of
his
bits
in
the
papers
some
dropped
hints
the
leach
and
the
men
at
the
counter
others
like
tommy
milner
asked
slap
out
you
may
be
sure
i
did
tell
them
a
fixed
sum
but
it
was
hopeless
to
say
i
was
getting
the
small
sum
which
my
ten
per
cent
commission
worked
out
at
on
the
other
hand
i
dared
not
pretend
i
was
being
paid
at
the
usual
rates
i
should
have
gone
broke
in
hours
you
have
no
idea
how
constantly
i
was
given
the
opportunity
of
lending
five
shillings
to
important
members
of
the
moon
staff
it
struck
me
then
and
i
have
found
out
for
certain
since
that
there
is
a
popular
anxiety
to
borrow
from
a
man
who
earns
money
by
writing
the
earnings
of
a
successful
writer
are
to
the
common
intelligence
something
he
ought
not
really
to
have
and
anyone
in
default
of
abstracting
his
income
may
fall
back
upon
taking
up
his
time
it
did
no
doubt
appear
that
i
was
coining
the
ready
besides
the
and
key
of
the
were
printing
my
signed
contributions
in
weekly
series
too
had
announced
on
its
placards
a
story
in
dialogue
by
sidney
price
this
then
was
my
position
on
the
morning
when
i
was
late
at
the
moon
and
lost
my
bonus
whilst
i
went
up
in
the
lift
to
the
new
business
room
and
whilst
i
was
entering
the
names
and
addresses
of
inquirers
in
the
proposal
book
i
was
trying
to
gather
courage
to
meet
what
was
in
store
for
the
future
held
this
that
my
name
would
disappear
from
the
papers
as
suddenly
as
it
had
arrived
there
people
would
want
to
know
why
i
had
given
up
writing
written
himself
out
no
staying
power
as
as
a
barnum
monstrosity
these
would
be
the
remarks
which
would
herald
ridicule
and
possibly
pity
and
i
should
be
in
just
the
same
beastly
fix
at
the
hollyhocks
as
i
was
at
the
moon
what
would
my
people
say
what
would
norah
say
there
was
another
reason
too
why
a
stoppage
of
the
ten
per
cent
cheques
would
be
a
whack
in
the
eye
you
see
i
had
been
doing
myself
well
on
them
uncommonly
well
i
had
ordered
as
a
present
to
my
parents
new
furniture
for
the
i
had
pressed
my
father
to
have
a
small
greenhouse
put
up
at
my
expense
he
had
always
wanted
one
but
had
never
been
able
to
run
to
it
and
i
had
taken
norah
about
a
good
deal
our
weekly
visit
to
a
matinée
upper
circle
and
ices
followed
by
tea
at
the
cabin
or
lyons
popular
had
become
an
institution
we
had
gone
occasionally
to
a
ball
at
the
town
hall
what
would
norah
say
when
all
this
ended
abruptly
without
any
explanation
there
was
no
getting
away
from
it
sidney
price
was
in
the
soup
chapter
norah
wins
home
sidney
price
narrative
continued
my
signed
work
had
run
out
for
two
weeks
nothing
had
been
printed
over
my
signature
so
far
no
comment
had
been
raised
but
it
was
only
a
question
of
days
but
then
one
afternoon
it
all
came
right
it
was
like
this
i
was
sitting
eating
my
lunch
at
eliza
in
birchin
lane
twenty
minutes
was
the
official
allowance
for
the
meal
and
i
took
my
twenty
minutes
at
two
the
stephen
was
lying
near
me
i
picked
it
up
anything
to
distract
my
thoughts
from
the
trouble
to
come
that
was
how
i
felt
reading
mechanically
the
front
page
i
saw
a
poem
and
started
violently
this
was
the
poem
a
cry
hands
at
the
tiller
to
steer
a
star
in
the
murky
sky
water
and
waste
of
mere
whither
and
why
sting
of
absorbent
night
journey
of
weal
or
woe
and
overhead
the
light
we
go
we
go
darkness
a
mortal
part
mortals
of
whom
we
are
come
to
a
mortal
heart
immortal
star
rummy
very
rummy
i
exclaimed
the
poem
was
dated
yesterday
had
cloyster
then
continued
to
work
his
system
with
thomas
blake
to
the
exclusion
of
the
reverend
and
myself
still
worrying
over
the
thing
i
turned
over
the
pages
of
the
paper
until
i
chanced
to
see
the
following
paragraph
literary
gossip
few
will
be
surprised
to
learn
that
the
rev
john
hatton
intends
to
publish
another
novel
in
the
immediate
future
first
book
it
was
created
little
less
than
a
furore
the
work
on
which
he
is
now
engaged
which
will
bear
the
title
of
browns
of
is
a
tender
sketch
of
english
domesticity
this
new
vein
of
hatton
will
doubtless
be
distinguished
by
the
naturalness
of
dialogue
and
sanity
of
characterisation
of
his
first
novel
prodder
and
way
are
to
publish
it
in
the
autumn
he
running
the
reverend
again
is
he
said
i
to
myself
and
the
only
one
left
out
it
a
bit
thick
that
night
i
wrote
to
blake
and
to
the
reverend
asking
whether
they
had
been
taken
on
afresh
and
if
so
could
i
get
a
look
in
as
things
were
pretty
serious
the
reverend
reply
arrived
first
the
temple
as
you
have
seen
i
am
hard
at
work
at
my
new
novel
the
leisure
of
a
novelist
is
so
scanty
that
i
know
you
forgive
my
writing
only
a
line
i
am
in
no
way
associated
with
james
orlebar
cloyster
nor
do
i
wish
to
be
rather
i
would
forget
his
very
existence
you
are
aware
of
the
interests
which
i
have
at
heart
social
reform
the
education
of
the
submerged
the
physical
needs
of
the
young
there
is
no
necessity
for
me
to
enumerate
my
ideals
further
to
get
quick
returns
from
philanthropy
to
put
remedial
organisation
into
speedy
working
order
wants
capital
system
was
one
way
of
obtaining
some
of
it
but
when
that
failed
i
had
to
look
out
for
another
i
glad
i
helped
in
the
system
for
it
made
me
realise
how
large
an
income
a
novelist
can
obtain
i
glad
it
failed
because
its
failure
suggested
that
i
should
try
to
get
for
myself
those
vast
sums
which
i
had
been
getting
for
the
selfish
purse
of
an
already
wealthy
man
unconsciously
he
has
played
into
my
hands
i
read
his
books
before
i
signed
them
and
i
find
that
i
have
thoroughly
absorbed
those
tricks
of
his
of
style
and
construction
which
opened
the
public
coffers
to
him
browns
of
will
eclipse
anything
that
cloyster
has
previously
done
for
this
reason
that
it
will
cloyster
it
is
cloyster
with
improvements
in
thus
abducting
his
public
i
shall
feel
no
compunction
his
serious
verse
and
his
society
dialogues
bring
him
in
so
much
that
he
can
not
be
in
danger
of
financial
embarrassment
sincerely
john
now
this
letter
set
my
brain
buzzing
like
the
engine
of
a
stationary
vanguard
i
too
had
been
in
the
habit
of
reading
dialogues
before
i
signed
and
sent
them
off
i
had
often
thought
to
myself
also
that
they
could
take
much
writing
that
it
was
all
a
knack
and
the
more
i
read
of
them
the
more
transparent
the
knack
appeared
to
me
to
be
just
for
a
lark
i
sat
down
that
very
evening
and
had
a
go
at
one
taking
the
park
for
my
scene
i
made
two
or
three
theatrical
celebrities
whose
names
i
had
seen
in
the
newspapers
talk
about
a
horse
race
at
least
one
talked
about
a
horse
race
and
the
others
thought
she
was
gassing
about
a
new
musical
comedy
the
name
of
the
play
being
the
same
as
the
name
of
the
horse
the
oriental
belle
a
very
amusing
muddle
with
lots
of
and
heaps
of
adverbial
explanation
in
small
print
such
as
miss
adeline
genée
with
the
faint
incipient
blush
which
adair
uses
to
test
her
rouge
imperial
that
sort
of
thing
i
had
it
typed
and
i
said
price
my
boy
there
more
cloyster
in
this
than
ever
cloyster
could
have
put
into
it
and
the
editor
of
the
printed
it
next
issue
as
a
matter
of
course
i
say
as
a
matter
of
course
with
intention
because
the
fellows
at
the
moon
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
too
you
see
when
it
first
appeared
i
left
the
copy
about
the
desk
in
the
new
business
room
hoping
tommy
milner
or
some
of
them
would
rush
up
and
congratulate
me
but
they
did
they
simply
said
do
litter
the
place
up
old
man
keep
your
papers
if
you
bring
here
in
your
locker
downstairs
one
of
them
say
i
fancy
something
about
its
not
being
quite
up
to
my
usual
they
did
know
it
was
my
maiden
effort
at
original
composition
and
i
could
tell
them
it
was
galling
you
admit
however
i
quickly
forgot
my
own
troubles
in
wondering
what
cloyster
was
doing
no
editor
i
foresaw
would
accept
his
society
stuff
as
long
as
mine
was
in
the
market
they
would
pay
for
cloyster
whilst
they
were
offered
the
refusal
of
was
likely
you
must
understand
i
was
in
my
conscience
about
the
affair
i
had
in
a
manner
of
speaking
pinched
cloyster
job
but
then
i
argued
to
myself
he
was
earning
quite
as
much
as
was
good
for
any
one
man
by
his
serious
verse
and
at
that
very
minute
our
slavey
little
ethelbertina
knocked
at
my
bedroom
door
and
gave
me
a
postcard
it
was
addressed
to
me
in
thick
straggly
writing
and
was
so
covered
with
that
a
bertillon
expert
would
have
gone
straight
off
his
nut
at
the
sight
of
it
my
usbend
began
the
postcard
as
received
yourn
e
as
no
truk
wif
the
other
man
e
is
a
pots
imself
an
e
can
do
a
job
of
potry
as
orfen
as
e
a
mine
to
your
obegent
servent
ada
blake
me
an
is
ole
ant
do
is
writin
up
for
im
so
then
i
saw
how
that
cry
thing
in
the
had
come
there
you
heard
me
give
my
opinion
about
telling
norah
my
past
life
well
you
agree
with
me
now
that
there
practically
nothing
to
tell
her
there
of
course
little
miss
richards
the
waitress
in
the
of
the
piccadilly
cabin
her
i
mean
with
the
fuzzy
golden
hair
done
low
you
often
exchanged
good
evening
with
her
i
sure
her
hair
done
low
she
used
to
make
rather
a
point
of
telling
me
that
why
i
do
know
especially
as
it
was
always
tidy
and
well
off
her
shoulders
and
then
there
was
the
haughty
lady
who
sold
programmes
in
the
haymarket
amphitheatre
but
she
got
the
sack
so
cookson
informs
me
therefore
as
i
shall
tell
norah
plainly
that
i
disapprove
of
the
cabin
the
past
can
hatch
no
egg
of
discord
in
the
shape
of
the
glove
the
only
thing
that
i
can
think
of
as
needing
suppression
is
the
part
i
played
in
cloyster
system
there
no
doubt
that
the
reverend
blake
and
i
have
between
us
put
a
fairly
considerable
spoke
in
cloyster
literary
wheel
but
what
am
i
to
do
to
begin
with
it
no
use
my
telling
norah
about
the
affair
because
it
would
do
her
no
good
and
might
tend
possibly
to
lessen
her
valuation
of
my
capabilities
at
present
my
dialogues
dazzle
her
and
once
your
is
dazzled
the
basis
of
matrimonial
happiness
is
assured
again
looking
at
it
from
cloyster
point
of
view
what
good
would
it
be
to
him
if
i
were
to
stop
writing
both
the
editor
and
the
public
have
realised
by
now
that
his
work
is
only
he
can
never
hope
to
get
a
tenth
of
his
original
prices
even
if
his
work
is
accepted
which
it
wo
be
for
directly
i
leave
his
market
clear
someone
else
will
collar
it
slap
off
besides
i
no
right
to
stop
my
dialogues
my
duty
to
norah
is
greater
than
my
duty
to
cloyster
unless
i
continue
to
be
paid
by
literature
i
shall
not
be
able
to
marry
norah
until
three
years
next
quarter
the
moon
has
passed
a
rule
about
it
and
an
official
who
marries
on
an
income
not
larger
than
eighty
pounds
per
annum
is
liable
to
dismissal
without
notice
norah
mother
would
let
her
wait
three
years
and
though
fellows
have
been
known
to
have
had
a
couple
of
kids
at
the
time
of
their
official
marriage
i
personally
could
stand
the
wear
and
tear
of
that
business
it
could
be
done
end
of
sidney
price
julian
eversleigh
narrative
chapter
the
transposition
of
sentiment
it
is
all
very
very
queer
i
do
not
understand
it
at
all
it
makes
me
sleepy
to
think
about
it
a
month
ago
i
hated
eva
tomorrow
i
marry
her
by
special
licence
now
what
this
my
brain
is
not
working
properly
i
am
becoming
jerky
i
tried
to
work
the
thing
out
algebraically
i
wrote
it
down
as
an
equation
thus
hatred
denoted
by
x
eva
reverse
of
hatred
y
eva
one
month
z
from
which
we
get
x
eva
y
eva
z
and
if
anybody
can
tell
me
what
that
means
if
it
means
anything
which
i
doubt
i
shall
be
grateful
as
i
said
before
my
brain
is
not
working
properly
there
is
no
doubt
that
my
temperament
has
changed
and
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
a
month
ago
i
was
soured
cynical
i
did
brush
my
hair
and
i
slept
too
much
i
talked
a
good
deal
about
life
now
i
am
blithe
and
optimistic
i
use
pomade
part
in
the
middle
and
sleep
eight
hours
and
no
more
i
have
not
made
an
epigram
for
days
it
is
all
very
queer
i
took
a
new
attitude
towards
life
at
about
a
quarter
to
three
on
the
morning
after
the
dance
i
had
waited
for
james
in
his
rooms
he
had
been
to
the
dance
examine
me
for
a
moment
as
i
wait
there
i
had
been
james
friend
for
more
than
two
years
and
a
half
i
had
watched
his
career
from
the
start
i
knew
him
before
he
had
located
exactly
the
short
cut
to
fortune
our
friendship
embraced
the
whole
period
of
his
sudden
extraordinary
success
had
not
envy
by
that
time
been
dead
in
me
it
might
have
been
pain
to
me
to
watch
him
accomplish
unswervingly
with
his
effortless
genius
the
things
i
had
once
dreamt
i
too
would
laboriously
achieve
but
i
grudged
him
nothing
rather
i
had
pleasure
in
those
triumphs
of
my
friend
there
was
no
confidence
we
had
withheld
from
one
another
when
he
told
me
of
his
relations
with
margaret
goodwin
he
had
counted
on
my
sympathy
as
naturally
as
he
had
requested
and
received
my
advice
to
no
living
soul
save
james
would
i
have
confessed
my
own
tragedy
my
hopeless
love
for
eva
it
is
inconceivable
that
i
should
have
misjudged
a
man
so
utterly
as
i
misjudged
james
that
is
the
latent
factor
at
the
root
of
my
problem
the
innate
rottenness
the
cardiac
villainy
of
james
orlebar
cloyster
in
a
measure
it
was
my
own
hand
that
laid
the
train
which
eventually
blew
james
hidden
smoulder
of
fire
into
the
blazing
beacon
of
wickedness
in
which
my
friend
satanic
soul
is
visible
in
all
its
lurid
nakedness
i
remember
well
that
evening
mild
with
the
prelude
of
spring
when
i
evolved
for
james
benefit
the
system
it
was
a
device
which
was
to
preserve
my
friend
liberty
and
at
the
same
time
to
preserve
my
friend
honour
how
perfect
in
its
irony
margaret
goodwin
mark
you
was
not
to
know
he
could
afford
to
marry
her
and
my
system
was
an
instrument
to
hide
from
her
the
truth
he
employed
that
system
it
gave
him
the
holiday
he
asked
for
he
went
into
society
among
his
acquaintances
were
the
and
at
their
house
he
met
eva
whether
his
determination
to
treat
eva
as
he
had
treated
margaret
came
to
him
instantly
or
by
degrees
i
do
not
know
inwardly
he
may
have
had
his
scheme
matured
in
embryo
but
outwardly
he
was
still
the
accomplished
hypocrite
he
was
the
soul
of
honour
outwardly
he
was
the
essence
of
sympathetic
tact
as
far
as
his
specious
exterior
went
then
came
the
of
may
on
that
date
the
first
of
james
orlebar
cloyster
masks
was
removed
i
had
breakfasted
earlier
than
usual
so
that
by
the
time
i
had
walked
from
rupert
court
to
walpole
street
it
was
not
yet
four
james
was
out
i
thought
i
would
wait
for
him
i
stood
at
his
window
then
i
saw
margaret
goodwin
what
features
what
a
complexion
and
james
i
murmured
is
actually
giving
this
the
miss
in
baulk
i
discovered
at
that
instant
that
i
did
not
know
james
he
was
a
fool
in
a
few
hours
i
was
to
discover
he
was
a
villain
too
she
came
in
and
i
introduced
myself
to
her
i
almost
forget
what
pretext
i
manufactured
but
i
remember
i
persuaded
her
to
go
back
to
guernsey
that
very
day
i
think
i
said
that
james
was
spending
friday
till
monday
in
the
country
and
had
left
no
address
i
was
determined
that
they
should
not
meet
she
was
far
too
good
for
a
man
who
obviously
did
not
appreciate
her
in
the
least
we
had
a
very
pleasant
chat
she
was
charming
at
first
she
was
apt
to
touch
on
james
a
shade
too
frequently
but
before
long
i
succeeded
in
diverting
our
conversation
into
less
uninteresting
topics
she
talked
of
guernsey
i
of
london
i
said
i
felt
i
had
known
her
all
my
life
she
said
that
one
had
undeniably
one
affinities
i
said
might
i
think
of
her
as
she
said
it
was
rather
unconventional
but
that
she
could
not
control
my
thoughts
i
said
there
you
are
wrong
margaret
she
said
oh
what
are
you
saying
mr
eversleigh
i
said
i
was
thinking
out
loud
on
the
doorstep
she
said
well
yes
julian
you
may
write
to
me
sometimes
but
i
wo
promise
to
answer
angel
the
next
thing
that
awakened
me
was
the
coming
of
james
after
i
had
given
him
a
suitable
version
of
margaret
visit
he
told
me
he
was
engaged
to
eva
that
was
an
astounding
thing
but
what
was
more
astounding
was
that
james
had
somehow
got
wind
of
the
real
spirit
of
my
interview
with
margaret
i
have
called
james
orlebar
cloyster
a
fool
i
have
called
him
a
villain
i
will
never
cease
to
call
him
a
genius
for
by
some
marvellous
capacity
for
introspection
by
some
incredible
projection
of
his
own
mind
into
other
people
matters
he
was
able
to
tax
me
to
my
face
with
an
attempt
to
win
his
former
affections
i
tried
to
choke
him
off
i
used
every
ounce
of
bluff
i
possessed
in
vain
i
left
walpole
street
in
a
state
approaching
mental
revolution
my
exact
feelings
towards
james
were
too
intricate
to
be
defined
in
a
single
word
not
so
my
feelings
towards
eva
hate
supplied
the
lacuna
in
her
case
thus
the
month
began
the
next
point
of
importance
is
my
interview
with
she
had
known
all
along
how
matters
stood
in
regard
to
eva
and
myself
she
had
not
been
hostile
to
me
on
that
account
she
had
only
pointed
out
that
as
i
could
do
nothing
towards
supporting
eva
i
had
better
keep
away
when
my
cousin
was
in
london
that
was
many
years
ago
since
then
we
had
seldom
met
latterly
not
at
all
invitations
still
arrived
from
her
but
her
afternoon
parties
clashed
with
my
pipe
and
as
for
her
evening
receptions
well
by
the
time
i
had
pieced
together
the
various
component
parts
of
my
dress
clothes
i
found
myself
ready
for
bed
that
is
to
say
more
ready
for
bed
than
i
usually
am
i
went
to
in
a
very
bitter
mood
i
was
bent
on
trouble
i
come
to
congratulate
eva
i
said
sighed
i
was
afraid
of
this
she
said
the
announcement
was
the
more
pleasant
i
went
on
because
james
has
been
a
bosom
friend
of
mine
i
afraid
you
are
going
to
be
extremely
disagreeable
about
your
cousin
engagement
she
said
i
am
i
answered
her
very
disagreeable
i
intend
to
shadow
the
young
couple
to
be
constantly
meeting
them
calling
attention
to
them
james
will
most
likely
have
to
try
to
assault
me
that
may
mean
a
black
eye
for
dear
james
it
will
certainly
mean
the
police
court
their
engagement
will
be
in
short
a
succession
of
hideous
a
series
of
laughable
scenes
julian
said
hitherto
you
have
acted
manfully
toward
eva
you
have
been
brave
have
you
no
regard
for
eva
none
i
said
nor
for
mr
cloyster
not
a
scrap
but
why
are
you
behaving
in
this
appallingly
selfish
way
this
was
a
facer
i
could
quite
explain
to
her
how
things
really
were
so
i
said
never
you
mind
selfish
or
not
i
out
for
trouble
that
night
i
had
a
letter
from
her
she
said
that
in
order
to
avoid
all
unpleasantness
eva
engagement
would
be
of
the
briefest
nature
possible
that
the
marriage
was
fixed
for
the
twelfth
of
next
month
that
the
wedding
would
be
a
very
quiet
one
and
that
until
the
day
of
the
wedding
eva
would
not
be
in
london
it
amused
me
to
find
how
thoroughly
i
had
terrified
how
excellently
i
must
have
acted
for
of
course
i
had
not
meant
a
word
i
had
said
to
that
good
lady
in
the
days
preceding
the
twelfth
of
june
i
confess
i
rather
softened
to
james
the
was
established
between
us
he
told
me
how
irresistible
eva
had
been
that
night
mentioned
how
completely
she
had
carried
him
away
had
she
not
carried
me
away
in
precisely
the
same
manner
once
upon
a
time
he
swore
he
loved
her
as
dearly
as
i
ca
call
to
mind
the
simile
he
employed
though
it
was
masterly
and
impressive
i
even
hinted
that
the
threats
i
had
used
in
the
presence
of
were
not
serious
he
thanked
me
but
said
i
had
frightened
her
to
such
good
purpose
that
the
date
would
now
have
to
stand
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
he
added
that
i
have
called
in
all
my
work
i
shall
want
every
penny
i
make
the
expenses
of
an
engaged
man
are
i
send
her
a
lot
of
flowers
every
morning
you
no
conception
how
much
a
few
orchids
cost
then
whenever
i
go
to
see
her
i
take
her
some
little
present
a
umbrella
a
bicycle
lamp
or
a
patent
i
indebted
to
you
julian
positively
indebted
to
you
for
cutting
short
our
engagement
i
now
go
on
to
point
two
the
morning
of
the
twelfth
of
june
hurried
footsteps
on
my
staircase
a
loud
tapping
at
my
door
the
church
clock
chiming
twelve
the
agitated
weeping
figure
of
approaching
my
hammock
a
telegram
thrust
into
my
hand
hysterical
exclamation
you
infamous
monster
you
you
are
at
the
bottom
of
this
all
very
disconcerting
all
fortunately
very
unusual
my
eyes
were
leaden
with
slumber
but
i
forced
myself
to
decipher
the
following
message
which
had
been
telegraphed
to
west
kensington
lane
wedding
must
be
cloyster
i
had
no
hand
in
this
i
cried
but
i
added
enthusiastically
it
serves
eva
jolly
well
right
chapter
a
chat
with
james
julian
eversleigh
narrative
continued
seemed
somehow
to
drift
away
after
that
apparently
i
went
to
sleep
again
and
she
did
wait
when
i
woke
it
was
getting
on
for
two
i
breakfasted
with
that
magnificent
telegram
propped
up
against
the
teapot
had
a
bath
dressed
and
shortly
before
five
was
well
on
my
way
to
walpole
street
the
more
i
thought
over
the
thing
the
more
it
puzzled
me
why
had
james
done
this
why
should
he
wish
to
treat
eva
in
this
manner
i
was
delighted
that
he
had
done
so
but
why
had
he
a
very
unexpected
person
james
james
was
lying
back
in
his
shabby
old
armchair
smoking
a
pipe
there
was
tea
on
the
table
the
room
seemed
more
dishevelled
than
ever
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
say
which
presented
the
sorrier
spectacle
the
room
or
its
owner
he
looked
up
as
i
came
in
and
nodded
listlessly
i
poured
myself
out
a
cup
of
tea
and
took
a
muffin
both
were
cold
and
clammy
i
went
to
the
bell
what
are
you
doing
asked
james
only
going
to
ring
for
some
more
tea
i
said
no
do
do
that
i
go
down
and
ask
for
it
you
do
mind
using
my
cup
do
you
he
went
out
of
the
room
and
reappeared
with
a
jug
of
hot
water
you
see
he
explained
if
blankley
brings
in
another
cup
charge
for
two
teas
instead
of
one
it
did
occur
to
me
i
said
sorry
it
sounds
mean
mumbled
james
not
at
all
i
said
you
quite
right
not
to
plunge
into
reckless
extravagance
james
blushed
slightly
a
feat
of
which
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
he
was
capable
the
fact
is
he
began
i
interrupted
him
never
mind
about
that
i
said
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
the
meaning
of
this
and
i
shoved
the
telegraph
form
under
his
nose
just
as
had
shoved
it
under
mine
it
means
that
i
done
he
said
i
do
understand
i
explain
i
have
postponed
my
marriage
for
the
same
reason
that
i
refused
you
a
clean
cup
because
i
can
not
afford
luxuries
it
may
be
my
dulness
but
still
i
do
follow
you
what
exactly
are
you
driving
at
i
done
for
i
on
the
rocks
i
a
pauper
a
what
a
pauper
i
laughed
the
man
was
splendid
there
was
no
other
word
for
it
and
shall
i
tell
you
something
else
that
you
are
i
said
you
are
a
low
sneaking
liar
you
are
playing
it
low
down
on
eva
he
laughed
this
time
it
irritated
me
unspeakably
do
try
to
work
off
the
hollow
mirthless
laugh
dodge
on
me
i
said
because
it
wo
do
you
a
blackguard
and
you
know
it
i
tell
you
i
done
for
i
barely
a
penny
in
the
world
rot
i
said
do
try
that
on
me
you
let
eva
down
plop
and
jolly
glad
but
all
the
same
you
a
skunk
nothing
can
alter
that
why
do
you
marry
the
girl
i
ca
he
said
it
would
be
too
dishonourable
dishonourable
yes
i
have
got
enough
money
i
could
ask
her
to
share
my
poverty
with
me
i
love
her
too
dearly
i
was
nearly
sick
the
beast
spoke
in
a
sort
of
hushed
voice
as
if
he
were
the
hero
in
a
melodrama
the
expression
on
his
face
made
me
feel
homicidal
oh
drop
it
i
said
poverty
good
lord
is
two
thousand
a
year
enough
to
start
on
but
i
have
got
two
thousand
a
year
oh
i
do
pretend
to
give
the
figures
to
a
shilling
you
do
understand
all
i
have
to
live
on
is
my
holiday
work
at
the
what
oh
yes
and
i
doing
some
lyrics
for
briggs
for
the
second
edition
of
belle
of
that
keep
me
going
for
a
bit
but
absolutely
out
of
the
question
to
think
of
marrying
anyone
if
i
can
keep
my
own
head
above
water
till
the
next
vacancy
occurs
at
the
i
shall
be
lucky
you
mad
i
not
though
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
soon
if
this
sort
of
thing
goes
on
i
tell
you
you
are
mad
otherwise
you
have
called
in
your
work
and
saved
yourself
having
to
pay
those
commissions
to
hatton
and
the
others
as
it
is
i
believe
they
somehow
done
you
out
of
your
cheques
and
the
shock
of
it
has
affected
your
brain
my
dear
julian
it
a
good
suggestion
that
about
calling
in
my
work
but
it
comes
a
little
late
i
called
it
in
weeks
ago
my
irritation
increased
what
is
the
use
of
lying
like
that
i
said
angrily
you
do
seem
to
credit
me
with
any
sense
at
all
do
you
think
i
never
read
the
papers
and
magazines
you
ca
have
called
in
your
work
the
still
being
printed
over
the
signatures
of
sidney
price
tom
blake
and
the
rev
john
hatton
i
caught
sight
of
a
lying
on
the
floor
beside
his
chair
i
picked
it
up
here
you
are
i
said
page
short
story
mary
mistake
by
sidney
price
how
about
that
that
it
julian
he
said
dismally
that
just
it
those
three
devils
have
pinched
my
job
they
learned
the
trick
of
the
thing
through
reading
my
stuff
and
now
they
turning
it
out
for
themselves
they
cut
me
out
my
market
gone
the
editors
and
publishers
wo
look
at
me
i
have
had
eleven
printed
rejection
forms
this
week
one
editor
wrote
and
said
that
he
did
not
want
that
why
i
sent
the
wire
let
see
those
rejection
forms
you
ca
they
burnt
they
got
on
my
nerves
and
i
burnt
them
oh
i
said
they
burnt
are
they
he
got
up
and
began
to
pace
the
room
but
i
sha
give
up
julian
he
cried
with
a
sickening
return
of
the
melodrama
hero
manner
i
sha
give
up
i
shall
still
persevere
the
fight
will
be
terrible
often
i
shall
feel
on
the
point
of
despair
yet
i
shall
win
through
i
feel
it
julian
i
have
the
grit
in
me
to
do
it
and
meanwhile
he
lowered
his
voice
and
seemed
surprised
that
the
orchestra
did
not
strike
up
the
slow
music
meanwhile
i
shall
ask
eva
to
wait
to
wait
the
colossal
the
napoleonic
impudence
of
the
man
i
have
known
men
who
seemed
literally
to
exude
gall
but
never
one
so
overflowing
with
it
as
james
orlebar
cloyster
as
i
looked
at
him
standing
there
and
uttering
that
great
speech
i
admired
him
i
ceased
to
wonder
at
his
success
in
life
i
shook
my
head
i
ca
do
it
i
said
regretfully
i
simply
can
not
begin
to
say
what
i
think
of
you
the
english
language
is
equal
to
it
i
can
not
coin
a
new
phraseology
to
meet
the
situation
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
are
unique
what
do
you
mean
absolutely
unique
though
i
had
hoped
you
would
have
known
me
better
than
to
believe
that
i
would
swallow
the
ludicrous
yarn
prepared
do
you
ever
stop
and
ask
yourself
on
these
occasions
if
it
good
enough
you
do
believe
me
my
dear
james
i
protested
believe
you
i
swear
it
all
true
every
word
of
it
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
been
behind
the
scenes
i
not
simply
an
ordinary
member
of
the
audience
i
know
how
the
illusion
is
produced
i
seen
the
strings
pulled
why
dash
it
showed
you
how
to
pull
them
i
never
came
across
a
finer
example
of
seething
the
kid
in
its
mother
milk
i
put
you
up
to
the
system
and
you
turn
round
and
try
to
take
me
in
with
it
yes
you
a
wonder
james
you
do
mean
to
say
you
think
do
be
an
ass
james
of
course
i
do
you
had
the
brazen
audacity
to
attempt
to
work
off
on
eva
the
game
you
played
on
margaret
but
you
made
a
mistake
you
forgotten
to
count
me
i
paused
and
ate
a
muffin
james
watched
me
with
fascinated
eyes
you
i
resumed
ethically
i
despise
eva
personally
i
detest
it
seems
therefore
that
i
may
expect
to
extract
a
certain
amount
of
amusement
from
the
situation
the
fun
will
be
inaugurated
by
your
telling
eva
that
she
may
have
to
wait
five
years
you
will
state
also
the
amount
of
your
present
income
suppose
i
decline
you
wo
you
think
not
i
am
sure
what
would
you
do
if
i
declined
i
should
call
upon
and
give
her
a
quarter
of
an
hour
entertainment
by
telling
her
of
the
system
and
explaining
to
her
in
detail
the
exact
method
of
its
working
and
the
reason
why
you
set
it
going
having
amused
in
this
manner
i
should
make
similar
revelations
to
eva
it
would
not
be
pleasant
for
you
subsequently
i
suppose
but
we
all
have
our
troubles
that
would
be
yours
he
hesitated
as
if
they
believe
it
he
said
weakly
i
think
they
would
they
laugh
at
you
they
think
you
were
mad
not
when
i
produced
john
hatton
sidney
price
and
tom
blake
in
a
solid
phalanx
and
asked
them
to
corroborate
me
they
would
do
it
he
said
snatching
at
a
straw
they
give
themselves
away
hatton
might
hesitate
to
but
tom
blake
would
do
it
like
a
shot
as
i
did
not
know
tom
blake
a
moment
reflection
might
have
told
james
that
this
was
bluff
but
i
had
gathered
a
certain
knowledge
of
the
bargee
character
from
james
conversation
and
i
knew
that
he
was
a
drunken
indiscreet
sort
of
person
who
might
be
expected
to
reveal
everything
in
circumstances
such
as
i
had
described
so
i
risked
the
shot
and
it
went
home
james
opposition
collapsed
i
shall
then
administering
the
de
arrange
a
meeting
between
the
and
old
mrs
goodwin
thank
you
said
james
but
do
bother
on
second
thoughts
i
will
tell
eva
about
my
income
and
the
five
years
wait
thanks
i
said
it
very
good
of
you
and
i
retired
chuckling
to
rupert
street
chapter
in
a
hansom
julian
eversleigh
narrative
continued
i
spent
a
pleasant
week
in
my
hammock
awaiting
developments
at
the
end
of
the
week
came
a
letter
from
eva
she
wrote
dear
you
have
been
to
see
us
for
ages
is
kensington
lane
beyond
the
pale
affectionate
you
vixen
i
thought
yes
i
come
and
see
you
fast
enough
it
will
give
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
see
you
crushed
and
humiliated
i
collected
my
evening
clothes
from
a
man
of
the
name
of
attenborough
whom
i
employ
to
take
care
of
them
when
they
are
not
likely
to
be
wanted
found
a
white
shirt
which
looked
presentable
after
a
little
pruning
of
the
cuffs
with
a
razor
and
drove
to
the
in
time
for
dinner
there
was
a
certain
atmosphere
of
unrest
about
the
house
i
attributed
this
at
first
to
the
effects
of
the
james
orlebar
cloyster
but
discovered
that
it
was
in
reality
due
to
the
fact
that
eva
was
going
out
to
a
ball
that
night
she
was
having
dinner
sent
up
to
her
room
they
told
me
and
would
be
down
presently
there
was
a
good
deal
of
flitting
about
going
on
maids
on
mysterious
errands
shot
up
and
down
stairs
old
looking
rather
wry
was
taking
cover
in
his
study
when
i
arrived
was
in
the
before
eva
came
down
i
got
a
word
alone
with
her
i
had
a
nice
letter
from
james
she
said
and
he
has
done
all
he
can
to
put
things
straight
with
us
ah
said
i
that
telegram
he
tells
me
was
the
outcome
of
a
sudden
panic
dear
me
i
said
it
seems
that
he
made
some
most
ghastly
mistake
about
his
finances
what
exactly
happened
i
ca
quite
understand
but
the
gist
of
it
is
he
thought
he
was
quite
well
off
whereas
really
his
income
is
infinitesimal
how
odd
i
remarked
it
sounds
odd
in
fact
i
could
scarcely
believe
it
until
i
got
his
letter
of
explanation
i
show
it
to
you
here
it
is
i
read
james
orlebar
cloyster
letter
with
care
it
was
not
particularly
long
but
i
wish
i
had
a
copy
of
it
for
it
is
the
finest
work
in
an
imaginative
vein
that
has
ever
been
penned
masterly
i
exclaimed
involuntarily
yes
is
it
she
echoed
enables
one
to
grasp
thoroughly
how
the
mistake
managed
to
occur
has
eva
seen
it
yes
i
notice
he
mentions
five
years
as
being
about
the
period
yes
it
rather
a
long
engagement
but
of
course
she
wait
she
loves
him
so
eva
now
entered
the
room
when
i
caught
sight
of
her
i
remembered
i
had
pictured
her
crushed
and
humiliated
i
had
expected
to
gloat
over
a
certain
dewiness
of
her
eyes
a
patient
drooping
of
her
lips
i
will
say
plainly
there
was
nothing
of
that
kind
about
eva
tonight
she
had
decided
to
go
to
the
ball
as
peter
pan
the
costume
had
rather
scandalised
old
a
venerable
tory
who
rarely
spoke
except
to
grumble
even
who
had
lately
been
elected
to
the
serfs
was
inclined
to
deprecate
it
but
i
was
sure
eva
had
chosen
the
better
part
the
dress
suited
her
to
perfection
her
legs
are
the
legs
of
a
boy
as
i
looked
at
her
with
concentrated
hatred
i
realised
i
had
never
seen
a
human
soul
so
radiant
so
brimming
with
so
altogether
to
be
desired
why
julian
is
it
you
this
good
of
you
it
was
evident
that
the
past
was
to
be
waived
i
took
my
cue
thanks
eva
i
said
it
suits
you
admirably
events
at
this
point
move
quickly
another
card
of
invitation
is
produced
would
i
care
to
use
it
and
take
eva
to
the
ball
but
i
not
in
fancy
dress
overruled
fancy
dress
not
an
essential
crowds
of
men
there
in
ordinary
evening
clothes
so
we
drove
off
we
hardly
exchanged
a
syllable
no
one
has
much
to
say
just
before
a
dance
i
looked
at
eva
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
trying
to
discover
just
what
it
was
in
her
that
attracted
men
i
knew
her
charm
though
i
flattered
myself
that
i
was
proof
against
it
i
wanted
to
analyse
it
her
photograph
is
on
the
table
before
me
as
i
write
i
look
at
it
critically
she
is
not
what
i
should
describe
as
exactly
a
type
of
english
beauty
you
know
the
sort
of
beauty
i
mean
queenly
statuesque
a
daughter
of
the
gods
divinely
fair
her
charm
is
not
in
her
features
it
is
in
her
expression
tonight
for
instance
as
we
drove
to
the
ball
there
sparkled
in
her
eyes
a
light
such
as
i
had
never
seen
in
them
before
every
girl
is
animated
at
a
ball
but
this
was
more
than
mere
animation
there
was
a
latent
devilry
about
her
and
behind
the
sparkle
and
the
glitter
a
film
a
mist
as
it
were
which
lent
almost
a
pathos
to
her
appearance
the
effect
it
had
on
me
was
to
make
me
tend
to
forget
that
i
hated
her
we
arrive
i
mutter
something
about
having
the
pleasure
eva
says
i
can
have
the
last
two
waltzes
here
comes
a
hiatus
i
am
told
that
i
was
seen
dancing
was
observed
to
eat
an
excellent
supper
and
was
noticed
in
the
with
a
cigarette
in
my
mouth
at
last
the
first
of
my
two
waltzes
the
eton
boating
song
one
of
my
favourites
i
threaded
my
way
through
the
room
in
search
of
her
she
was
in
neither
of
the
doorways
i
cast
my
eyes
about
the
room
her
costume
was
so
distinctive
that
i
could
hardly
fail
to
see
her
i
did
see
her
she
was
dancing
my
waltz
with
another
man
the
thing
seemed
to
numb
my
faculties
i
stood
in
the
doorway
gaping
i
could
understand
it
the
illogical
nature
of
my
position
did
not
strike
me
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
as
i
hated
the
girl
so
much
it
was
much
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
that
i
should
see
as
little
of
her
as
possible
my
hatred
was
entirely
concentrated
on
the
bounder
who
had
stolen
my
dance
he
was
a
small
little
beast
and
it
maddened
me
to
see
that
he
danced
better
than
i
could
ever
have
done
as
they
whirled
past
me
she
smiled
at
him
i
rushed
to
the
whether
she
gave
my
other
waltz
to
the
same
man
or
whether
she
chose
some
other
partner
or
sat
alone
waiting
for
me
i
do
not
know
when
i
returned
to
the
ballroom
the
last
waltz
was
over
and
the
orchestra
was
beginning
softly
to
play
the
first
extra
it
was
tout
passe
an
air
that
has
always
had
the
power
to
thrill
me
my
heart
gave
a
bound
standing
in
the
doorway
just
in
front
of
me
was
eva
i
drew
back
two
or
three
men
came
up
and
asked
her
for
the
dance
she
sent
them
away
and
my
heart
leaped
as
they
went
she
was
standing
with
her
back
towards
me
now
she
turned
our
eyes
met
we
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
one
another
then
i
heard
her
give
a
little
sigh
and
instantly
i
forgot
everything
my
hatred
my
two
lost
dances
the
blighter
everything
everything
but
that
i
loved
her
tired
eva
i
said
perhaps
i
am
she
replied
yes
i
am
julian
give
me
this
one
i
whispered
we
sit
it
out
very
well
it
so
hot
in
here
we
go
and
sit
it
out
in
a
hansom
shall
we
i
get
my
cloak
i
waited
numbed
by
her
absence
her
cloak
was
pale
pink
we
walked
out
together
into
the
starry
night
a
few
yards
off
stood
a
hansom
drive
to
the
corner
of
sloane
street
i
said
to
the
man
by
way
of
the
park
the
night
was
very
still
i
have
said
that
i
had
forgotten
everything
except
that
i
loved
her
could
i
remember
now
now
as
we
drove
together
through
the
empty
streets
alone
her
warm
palpitating
body
touching
mine
james
and
his
awful
predicament
which
would
last
till
eva
gave
him
up
eva
callous
treatment
of
my
former
love
for
her
my
own
affection
for
margaret
my
these
things
had
become
suddenly
of
no
account
eva
i
murmured
and
i
took
her
hand
eva
her
wonderful
eyes
met
mine
the
mist
in
them
seemed
to
turn
to
dew
my
darling
she
whispered
very
low
the
road
was
deserted
we
were
alone
i
drew
her
face
to
mine
and
kissed
her
my
love
for
her
grows
daily
old
has
introduced
me
to
a
big
firm
of
linoleum
manufacturers
i
am
taking
over
their
huge
system
of
advertising
next
week
my
salary
will
be
enormous
it
almost
frightens
me
old
cresswell
tells
me
that
he
had
had
the
job
in
his
mind
for
me
for
some
time
and
had
indeed
mentioned
to
his
wife
and
eva
at
lunch
that
day
that
he
intended
to
write
to
me
about
it
i
am
more
grateful
to
him
than
i
can
ever
make
him
understand
eva
i
know
cares
nothing
for
money
she
told
me
so
but
it
is
a
comfort
to
feel
that
i
can
keep
her
almost
in
luxury
i
have
given
up
my
rooms
in
rupert
street
i
sleep
in
a
bed
i
do
sandow
exercises
i
am
always
down

resumed

chapter
a
rift
in
the
clouds
o
perfidy
of
woman
o
feminine
inconstancy
that
is
the
only
allusion
i
shall
permit
to
escape
me
on
the
subject
of
eva
eversleigh
engagement
to
that
scoundrel
julian
i
had
the
news
by
telegraph
and
the
heavens
darkened
above
me
whilst
the
solid
earth
rocked
below
i
had
been
trapped
into
dishonour
and
even
the
bait
had
been
withheld
from
me
but
it
was
not
the
loss
of
eva
that
troubled
me
most
it
should
have
outweighed
all
my
other
misfortunes
and
made
them
seem
of
no
account
but
it
did
not
man
is
essentially
a
materialist
the
prospect
of
an
empty
stomach
is
more
serious
to
him
than
a
broken
heart
a
broken
heart
is
the
luxury
of
the
what
troubled
me
more
than
all
other
things
at
this
juncture
was
the
thought
that
i
was
face
to
face
with
starvation
and
that
only
the
grimmest
of
fights
could
enable
me
to
avoid
it
i
quaked
at
the
prospect
the
early
struggles
of
the
writer
to
keep
his
head
above
water
form
an
experience
which
does
not
bear
repetition
the
hopeless
feeling
of
chipping
a
little
niche
for
oneself
out
of
the
solid
rock
with
a
nib
is
a
nightmare
even
in
times
of
prosperity
i
remembered
the
grey
days
of
my
literary
apprenticeship
and
i
shivered
at
the
thought
that
i
must
go
through
them
again
i
examined
my
position
dispassionately
over
a
cup
of
coffee
at
groom
in
fleet
street
groom
was
a
recognised
when
i
was
doing
on
your
way
one
or
two
of
us
used
to
go
down
fleet
street
for
coffee
after
the
morning
work
with
the
regularity
of
machines
it
formed
a
recognised
break
in
the
day
i
thought
things
over
how
did
i
stand
holiday
work
at
the
would
begin
very
shortly
so
that
i
should
get
a
good
start
in
my
race
fermin
would
be
going
away
in
a
few
weeks
then
gresham
and
after
that
fane
the
man
who
did
the
people
and
things
column
with
luck
i
ought
to
get
a
clear
fifteen
weeks
of
regular
work
it
would
just
save
me
in
fifteen
weeks
i
ought
to
have
got
going
again
the
difficulty
was
that
i
had
dropped
out
editors
had
forgotten
my
work
john
hatton
they
knew
and
sidney
price
they
knew
but
who
was
james
orlebar
cloyster
there
would
be
much
creaking
of
joints
and
wobbling
of
wheels
before
my
triumphal
car
could
gather
speed
again
but
with
a
regular
salary
coming
in
week
by
week
from
the
i
could
endure
this
i
became
almost
cheerful
it
is
an
exhilarating
sensation
having
back
against
the
wall
then
there
was
briggs
the
actor
the
very
thought
of
him
was
a
tonic
a
born
fighter
with
the
energy
of
six
men
he
was
an
ideal
model
for
me
if
i
could
work
with
a
sixth
of
his
dash
and
pluck
i
should
be
safe
he
was
giving
me
work
he
might
give
me
more
the
new
edition
of
the
of
was
due
in
another
fortnight
my
lyrics
would
be
used
and
i
should
get
paid
for
them
add
this
to
my
salary
and
i
should
be
a
man
of
substance
i
glared
over
my
at
an
imaginary
john
hatton
you
thought
you
done
me
did
you
i
said
to
him
by
gad
i
have
the
laugh
of
you
all
yet
i
was
shaking
my
fist
at
him
when
the
door
opened
i
hurriedly
tilted
back
my
chair
and
looked
out
of
the
window
hullo
cloyster
i
looked
round
it
was
fermin
just
the
man
i
wanted
to
see
he
seemed
depressed
even
embarrassed
how
the
column
i
asked
oh
all
right
he
said
awkwardly
i
wanted
to
see
you
about
that
i
was
going
to
write
to
you
oh
yes
i
said
of
course
about
the
holiday
work
when
are
you
off
i
was
thinking
of
starting
next
week
good
sorry
to
lose
you
of
course
but
he
shuffled
his
feet
you
doing
pretty
well
now
at
the
game
are
you
cloyster
he
said
it
was
not
to
my
interests
to
cry
myself
down
so
i
said
that
i
was
doing
quite
decently
he
seemed
relieved
you
making
quite
a
good
income
i
suppose
i
mean
no
difficulty
about
placing
your
stuff
editors
squeal
for
it
because
otherwise
what
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
might
have
been
something
of
a
blow
but
it
wo
affect
you
much
if
you
doing
plenty
of
work
elsewhere
a
cold
hand
seemed
laid
upon
my
heart
my
mind
leaped
to
what
he
meant
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
holiday
work
my
do
you
remember
writing
a
par
about
stickney
the
man
you
know
ragging
him
when
he
got
his
peerage
yes
it
was
one
of
the
best
paragraphs
i
had
ever
done
a
thing
full
of
point
and
sting
i
had
been
editing
on
your
way
that
day
fermin
being
on
a
holiday
and
gresham
ill
and
i
had
put
the
paragraph
conspicuously
at
the
top
of
the
column
well
said
fermin
i
afraid
there
was
rather
trouble
about
it
hamilton
came
into
our
room
yesterday
and
asked
if
i
should
be
seeing
you
i
said
i
thought
i
should
tell
him
said
hamilton
that
paragraph
of
his
about
stickney
has
only
cost
us
five
hundred
pounds
that
all
and
he
went
out
again
apparently
stickney
was
on
the
point
of
advertising
largely
with
the
and
had
backed
out
in
a
huff
today
i
went
to
see
him
about
my
holiday
and
he
wanted
to
know
who
was
coming
in
to
do
my
work
i
mentioned
you
and
he
absolutely
refused
to
have
you
in
i
awfully
sorry
about
it
i
was
silent
the
shock
was
too
great
instead
of
drifting
easily
into
my
struggle
on
a
comfortable
weekly
salary
i
should
have
to
start
the
fighting
at
once
i
wanted
to
get
away
somewhere
by
myself
and
grapple
with
the
position
i
said
to
fermin
retaining
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
treat
the
thing
lightly
and
walked
swiftly
along
the
restless
strand
marvelling
at
what
i
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
fortune
the
deceiver
of
margaret
deceived
by
eva
a
pauper
i
covered
the
distance
between
groom
and
walpole
street
in
sombre
meditation
in
a
sort
of
dull
panic
i
sat
down
immediately
on
my
arrival
and
tried
to
work
i
told
myself
that
i
must
turn
out
something
that
it
would
be
madness
to
waste
a
moment
i
sat
and
chewed
my
pen
from
two
till
five
but
not
a
page
of
printable
stuff
could
i
turn
out
looking
back
at
myself
at
that
moment
i
am
not
surprised
that
my
ideas
did
not
flow
it
would
have
been
a
wonderful
triumph
of
strength
of
mind
if
i
had
been
able
to
write
after
all
that
had
happened
johnson
has
laid
it
down
that
a
man
can
write
at
any
time
if
he
sets
himself
to
it
earnestly
but
mine
were
exceptional
circumstances
my
life
happiness
and
my
means
for
supporting
life
at
all
happy
or
otherwise
had
been
swept
away
in
a
single
morning
and
i
found
myself
utterly
unable
to
pen
a
coherent
sentence
at
five
i
gave
up
the
struggle
and
rang
for
tea
while
i
was
having
tea
there
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
and
my
landlady
brought
in
a
large
parcel
i
recognised
the
writing
on
the
label
the
hand
was
margaret
i
wondered
in
an
impersonal
sort
of
way
what
margaret
could
be
sending
to
me
from
the
feel
of
it
the
contents
were
paper
it
amuses
me
now
to
think
that
it
was
a
good
before
i
took
the
trouble
to
cut
the
string
fortune
and
happiness
were
waiting
for
me
in
that
parcel
and
i
would
not
bother
to
open
it
i
sat
in
my
chair
smoking
and
thinking
and
occasionally
cast
a
gloomy
eye
at
the
parcel
but
i
did
not
open
it
then
my
pipe
went
out
and
i
found
that
i
had
no
matches
in
my
pocket
there
were
some
at
the
farther
end
of
the
mantelpiece
i
had
to
get
up
to
reach
them
and
once
up
i
found
myself
filled
with
a
sufficient
amount
of
energy
to
take
a
knife
from
the
table
and
cut
the
string
languidly
i
undid
the
brown
paper
the
contents
were
a
pile
of
typewritten
pages
and
a
letter
it
was
the
letter
over
which
my
glassy
eyes
travelled
first
my
own
dear
brave
old
darling
james
it
began
and
its
purport
was
that
she
had
written
a
play
and
wished
me
to
put
my
name
to
it
and
hawk
it
round
to
pass
off
as
my
work
her
own
amateurish
effort
at
playwriting
ludicrous
and
so
immoral
too
i
had
always
imagined
that
margaret
had
a
perfectly
flawless
sense
of
honesty
yet
here
she
was
asking
me
deliberately
to
impose
on
the
credulity
of
some
poor
trusting
theatrical
manager
the
dreadful
disillusionment
of
it
shocked
me
most
men
would
have
salved
their
wounded
susceptibilities
by
putting
a
match
to
the
manuscript
without
further
thought
or
investigation
but
i
have
ever
been
haunted
by
a
somewhat
conscience
and
i
sat
down
there
and
then
to
read
the
stupid
stuff
at
seven
i
was
still
reading
my
dinner
was
brought
in
i
bolted
it
with
margaret
play
propped
up
against
the
potato
dish
i
read
on
and
on
i
could
not
leave
it
incredible
as
it
would
appear
from
anyone
but
me
i
solemnly
assure
you
that
the
typewritten
nonsense
i
read
that
evening
was
nothing
else
than
girl
who
chapter
briggs
to
the
rescue
james
orlebar
cloyster
narrative
continued
i
finished
the
last
page
and
i
laid
down
the
typescript
reverently
the
thing
amazed
me
unable
as
i
was
to
turn
out
a
good
acting
play
of
my
own
i
was
nevertheless
sufficiently
gifted
with
an
appreciation
of
the
dramatic
to
be
able
to
recognise
such
a
play
when
i
saw
it
there
were
situations
in
margaret
comedy
which
would
grip
a
london
audience
and
force
laughter
and
tears
from
it
well
the
public
side
of
that
idiotic
play
is
history
everyone
knows
how
many
nights
it
ran
and
the
press
from
time
to
time
tells
its
readers
what
were
the
profits
from
it
that
accrued
to
the
author
i
turned
to
margaret
letter
and
the
last
page
she
put
the
thing
very
well
very
sensibly
as
i
read
my
scruples
began
to
vanish
after
all
was
it
so
very
immoral
this
little
deception
that
she
proposed
i
have
written
down
the
words
she
said
but
the
conception
is
yours
the
play
was
inspired
by
you
but
for
you
i
should
never
have
begun
it
well
if
she
put
it
like
that
you
alone
are
able
to
manage
the
business
side
of
the
production
you
know
the
right
men
to
go
to
to
approach
them
on
behalf
of
a
work
is
far
less
likely
to
lead
to
success
true
true
i
have
assumed
you
will
see
that
the
play
is
certain
to
be
produced
but
that
will
only
be
so
if
you
adopt
it
as
your
own
there
was
sense
in
this
claim
the
authorship
and
all
will
be
well
i
will
i
said
i
packed
up
the
play
in
its
brown
paper
and
rushed
from
the
house
at
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
king
road
i
stopped
to
send
a
telegram
it
consisted
of
the
words
accept
cloyster
then
i
took
a
cab
from
the
rank
at
sloane
square
and
told
the
man
to
drive
to
the
of
the
briggs
theatre
in
shaftesbury
avenue
the
in
sloane
square
is
really
a
home
for
superannuated
horses
it
is
a
sort
of
equine
athenaeum
no
horse
is
ever
seen
there
till
it
has
passed
well
into
the
sere
and
yellow
a
sloane
square
may
be
distinguished
by
the
dignity
of
its
movements
it
is
happiest
when
walking
the
animal
which
had
the
privilege
of
making
history
by
conveying
me
and
girl
who
to
the
briggs
theatre
was
asthmatic
and
i
think
sickening
for
the
botts
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
cool
my
brain
and
think
out
a
plan
of
campaign
stanley
briggs
whom
i
proposed
to
try
first
was
the
one
man
i
should
have
liked
to
see
in
the
part
of
james
the
hero
of
the
piece
the
part
might
have
been
written
round
him
there
was
the
objection
of
course
that
girl
who
was
not
a
musical
comedy
but
i
knew
he
would
consider
a
straight
play
and
put
it
on
if
it
suited
him
i
was
confident
that
girl
who
would
be
just
what
he
wanted
the
problem
was
how
to
get
him
to
himself
for
a
sufficient
space
of
time
when
a
man
is
doing
the
work
of
half
a
dozen
he
is
likely
to
get
on
in
the
world
but
he
has
as
a
rule
little
leisure
for
conversation
my
octogenarian
came
to
a
standstill
at
last
at
the
and
seemed
relieved
at
having
won
safely
through
a
strenuous
bit
of
work
i
went
through
in
search
of
my
man
his
was
the
first
place
i
drew
i
knew
that
he
was
not
due
on
the
stage
for
another
ten
minutes
richard
belsey
his
valet
was
tidying
up
the
room
as
i
entered
briggs
anywhere
about
richard
i
asked
down
on
the
side
sir
i
think
there
a
new
song
in
tonight
for
briggs
and
he
gone
to
listen
how
it
goes
which
side
do
you
know
sir
i
think
i
went
downstairs
and
through
the
into
the
wings
the
corner
was
packed
standing
room
only
and
the
overflow
reached
nearly
to
the
doors
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
was
roomy
compared
with
the
wings
on
the
night
of
a
new
song
everybody
who
had
the
least
excuse
for
being
out
of
his
or
her
at
that
moment
was
peering
through
odd
chinks
in
the
scenery
principals
children
and
other
theatrical
fauna
waited
in
a
solid
mass
for
the
arrival
of
the
the
atmosphere
behind
the
scenes
has
always
had
the
effect
of
making
me
feel
as
if
my
boots
were
number
fourteens
and
my
hands
if
anything
larger
directly
i
have
passed
the
i
shuffle
like
one
oppressed
with
a
guilty
conscience
outside
i
may
have
been
composed
even
jaunty
inside
i
am
hangdog
beads
of
perspiration
form
on
my
brow
my
collar
tightens
my
boots
begin
to
squeak
i
smile
vacuously
i
shuffled
smiling
vacuously
and
clutching
the
of
girl
who
to
the
corner
i
caught
the
eye
of
a
tall
lady
in
and
said
good
evening
huskily
my
voice
is
always
husky
behind
the
scenes
elsewhere
it
is
like
some
beautiful
bell
a
piercing
whisper
of
came
from
somewhere
close
at
hand
this
sort
of
thing
does
not
help
bright
and
sparkling
conversation
i
and
passed
on
at
the
back
of
the
corner
timothy
prince
the
comedian
was
filling
in
the
time
before
the
next
entrance
by
waltzing
with
one
of
the
he
suspended
the
operation
to
greet
me
hullo
dear
heart
he
said
how
goes
it
seen
briggs
anywhere
i
asked
round
on
the
prompt
side
i
think
he
was
here
a
second
ago
but
he
dashed
off
at
this
moment
the
was
given
and
a
considerable
section
of
the
multitude
passed
on
to
the
stage
locomotion
being
rendered
easier
i
hurried
round
to
the
prompt
side
but
when
i
arrived
there
were
no
signs
of
the
missing
man
seen
briggs
anywhere
i
asked
here
a
moment
ago
said
one
of
the
carpenters
he
went
out
after
miss
lewin
song
began
i
think
he
gone
round
the
other
side
i
dashed
round
to
the
corner
again
he
had
just
left
taking
up
the
trail
i
went
to
his
once
more
you
just
too
late
sir
said
richard
he
was
here
a
moment
ago
i
decided
to
wait
i
wonder
if
he
be
back
soon
he
probably
downstairs
his
call
is
in
another
two
minutes
i
went
downstairs
and
waited
on
the
prompt
side
sir
boyle
bird
was
sedentary
compared
with
this
elusive
man
presently
he
appeared
hullo
dear
old
boy
he
said
welcome
to
elsmore
come
and
see
me
before
you
go
will
you
i
got
an
idea
for
a
song
i
say
i
said
as
he
flitted
past
can
i
tell
me
later
on
and
he
sprang
on
to
the
stage
by
the
time
i
had
worked
my
way
at
the
end
of
the
performance
through
the
crowd
of
visitors
who
were
waiting
to
see
him
in
his
i
found
that
he
had
just
three
minutes
in
which
to
get
to
the
savoy
to
keep
an
urgent
appointment
he
explained
that
he
was
just
dashing
off
i
shall
be
at
the
theatre
all
tomorrow
morning
though
he
said
come
round
about
twelve
will
you
there
was
a
rehearsal
at
eleven
next
morning
when
i
got
to
the
theatre
i
found
him
on
the
stage
he
was
superintending
the
chorus
talking
to
one
man
about
a
song
and
to
two
others
about
motors
and
dictating
letters
to
his
secretary
taking
advantage
of
this
spell
of
comparative
idleness
i
advanced
with
the
typescript
hullo
old
boy
he
said
just
a
minute
sit
down
wo
you
have
a
cigar
i
sat
down
on
the
act
one
sofa
and
he
resumed
his
conversations

said

a
quarter
of
an
hour
he

ready

me
i
wish

a
shot
at
it
old

soon

was
wondering

mind
glancing

a
part
in
it
that
would
just
suit
you
what
is
it
musical
comedy
no
ordinary
comedy
i
should
mind
putting
on
a
comedy
soon
i
must
have
a
look
at
it
come
and
have
a
bit
of
lunch
one
of
the
firemen
came
up
carrying
a
card
hullo
what
this
oh
confound
the
feller
he
always
coming
here
look
here
tell
him
that
i
just
gone
out
to
lunch
but
can
see
him
at
three
come
along
old
boy
he
began
to
read
the
play
over
the
coffee
and
cigars
he
read
it
straight
through
as
i
had
done
what
rot
he
said
as
he
turned
the
last
page
is
it
i
exclaimed
enthusiastically
but
wo
it
go
go
he
shouted
with
such
energy
that
several
lunchers
spun
round
in
their
chairs
and
a
rand
magnate
who
was
eating
peas
at
the
next
table
started
and
cut
his
mouth
go
it
the
limit
this
is
just
the
sort
of
thing
to
get
right
at
them
it
hit
them
where
they
live
what
made
you
think
of
that
drivel
at
the
end
of
act
two
genius
i
suppose
what
do
you
think
of
james
as
a
part
for
you
top
hole
good
lord
i
have
congratulated
you
consider
it
done
thanks
we
drained
our
liqueur
glasses
to
girl
who
and
to
ourselves
briggs
after
a
lifetime
spent
in
doing
three
things
at
once
is
not
a
man
who
lets
a
great
deal
of
grass
grow
under
his
feet
before
i
left
him
that
night
the
ideal
cast
of
the
play
had
been
jotted
down
and
much
of
the
actual
cast
settled
rehearsals
were
in
full
swing
within
a
week
and
the
play
was
produced
within
ten
days
of
the
demise
of
its
predecessor
meanwhile
the
satisfactory
sum
which
i
received
in
advance
of
royalties
was
sufficient
to
remove
any
regrets
as
to
the
loss
of
the
holiday
work
with
girl
who
in
active
rehearsal
on
your
way
lost
in
importance
chapter
my
triumph
james
orlebar
cloyster
narrative
continued
on
the
morning
of
the
day
for
which
the
production
had
been
fixed
it
dawned
upon
me
that
i
had
to
meet
goodwin
and
margaret
at
waterloo
all
through
the
busy
days
of
rehearsal
even
on
those
awful
days
when
everything
went
wrong
and
actresses
breaking
down
sobbed
in
the
wings
and
refused
to
be
comforted
i
had
dimly
recognised
the
fact
that
when
i
met
margaret
i
should
have
to
be
honest
with
her
plans
for
evasion
had
been
by
my
inventive
faculties
only
to
be
discarded
unpolished
on
account
of
the
insistent
claims
of
the
endless
rehearsals
to
have
concocted
a
story
with
which
to
persuade
margaret
that
i
stood
to
lose
money
if
the
play
succeeded
would
have
been
a
clear
day
work
and
i
had
no
clear
days
but
this
was
not
all
there
was
another
reason
somehow
my
sentiments
with
regard
to
her
were
changing
again
it
was
as
if
i
were
awaking
from
some
dream
i
felt
as
if
my
eyes
had
been
blindfolded
to
prevent
me
seeing
margaret
as
she
really
was
and
that
now
the
bandage
had
been
removed
as
the
day
of
production
drew
nearer
and
the
play
began
to
take
shape
i
caught
myself
sincerely
admiring
the
girl
who
could
hit
off
first
shot
the
exact
shade
of
drivel
which
the
london
stage
required
what
culture
what
excessive
she
must
have
how
absurdly
how
impossibly
melodramatic
how
maudlinly
sentimental
how
improbable
in
fact
how
altogether
womanly
she
must
have
grown
womanly
that
did
it
i
felt
that
she
was
womanly
and
it
came
about
that
it
was
my
margaret
of
the
cobo
shrimping
journeys
that
i
was
prepared
to
welcome
as
i
drove
that
morning
to
waterloo
station
and
so
when
the
train
rolled
in
and
the
goodwins
alighted
and
margaret
kissed
me
by
an
extraordinarily
lucky
chance
i
found
that
i
loved
her
more
dearly
than
ever
that
is
still
fresh
in
my
memory
goodwin
margaret
and
myself
occupied
the
stage
box
and
in
various
parts
of
the
house
i
could
see
the
familiar
faces
of
those
whom
i
had
invited
as
my
guests
i
felt
it
was
the
supreme
event
of
my
life
it
was
moment
and
surely
i
should
have
spoilt
it
all
unless
my
friends
had
been
sitting
near
me
eva
and
julian
were
with
and
in
the
box
opposite
us
to
the
barrel
club
i
had
sent
the
first
row
of
the
dress
circle
it
was
expensive
but
worth
it
hatton
and
sidney
price
were
in
the
stalls
tom
blake
had
preferred
a
free
pass
to
the
gallery
kit
and
malim
were
at
the
back
of
the
upper
circle
this
was
malim
told
me
kit
own
choice
one
by
one
the
members
of
the
orchestra
took
their
places
for
the
overture
and
it
was
to
the
appropriate
strains
of
land
of
hope
and
glory
that
the
curtain
rose
on
the
first
act
of
my
play
the
first
act
i
should
mention
though
it
is
no
doubt
superfluous
to
do
so
is
bright
and
suggestive
but
ends
on
a
clear
firm
note
of
pathos
that
is
why
as
soon
as
the
lights
went
up
i
levelled
my
glasses
at
the
eyes
of
the
critics
certainly
in
two
cases
and
i
think
in
a
third
i
caught
the
glint
of
one
critic
was
blowing
his
nose
another
sobbed
like
a
child
and
i
had
a
hurried
vision
of
a
third
staggering
out
to
the
foyer
with
his
hand
to
his
eyes
margaret
was
removing
her
own
tears
with
a
handkerchief
goodwin
unmoved
face
may
have
hidden
a
lacerated
soul
but
she
did
not
betray
herself
hers
may
have
been
the
thoughts
that
lie
too
deep
for
tears
at
any
rate
she
did
not
weep
instead
she
drew
from
her
reticule
the
fragmentary
writings
of
an
early
portuguese
author
these
she
perused
during
the
present
and
succeeding
pressing
margaret
hand
i
walked
round
to
the
box
to
see
what
effect
the
act
had
had
on
them
one
glance
at
their
faces
was
enough
they
were
long
and
hard
this
is
a
real
compliment
i
said
to
myself
for
the
whole
party
cut
me
dead
i
withdrew
delighted
they
had
come
of
course
to
assist
at
my
failure
i
had
often
observed
to
julian
how
curiously
lacking
i
was
in
dramatic
instinct
and
julian
had
predicted
to
eva
and
her
aunt
and
uncle
a
glorious
fiasco
they
were
furious
at
their
hopes
being
so
egregiously
disappointed
had
they
dreamt
of
a
success
they
would
have
declined
to
be
present
indeed
through
act
two
i
saw
them
creeping
away
into
the
night
the
barrel
club
i
discovered
in
the
bar
as
i
approached
i
heard
michael
declare
that
there
not
been
such
an
act
produced
since
his
show
was
put
on
at
he
was
interrupted
by
old
maundrell
asserting
that
the
business
arranged
for
valet
reminded
him
of
a
story
about
leopold
lewis
they
too
added
their
quota
to
my
cup
of
pleasure
by
being
distinctly
frigid
ascending
to
the
gallery
i
found
another
compliment
awaiting
me
tom
blake
was
fast
asleep
the
quality
of
blake
intellect
was
in
inverse
ratio
to
that
of
goodwin
neither
of
them
appreciated
the
stuff
that
suited
so
well
the
tastes
of
the
million
and
it
was
consequently
quite
consistent
that
while
goodwin
dozed
in
spirit
tom
blake
should
snore
in
reality
with
hatton
and
price
i
did
not
come
into
contact
i
noticed
however
that
they
wore
an
expression
of
relief
at
the
enthusiastic
reception
my
play
had
received
but
an
encounter
with
kit
and
malim
was
altogether
charming
they
had
had
some
slight
quarrel
on
the
way
to
the
theatre
and
had
found
a
means
of
reconciliation
in
their
mutual
emotion
at
the
pathos
of
the
first
act
finale
they
were
now
sitting
hand
in
hand
telling
each
other
how
sorry
they
were
they
congratulated
me
warmly
a
couple
of
hours
more
and
the
curtain
had
fallen
the
roar
the
frenzied
scene
the
picture
of
a
vast
audience
with
excitement
how
it
all
comes
back
to
me
and
now
as
i
sit
in
this
quiet
of
a
peter
port
hotel
i
hear
again
the
shout
of
author
i
see
myself
again
stepping
forward
from
the
wings
that
short
appearance
of
mine
that
brief
speech
behind
the
footlights
fixed
my
