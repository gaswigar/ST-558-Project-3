little
lord
fauntleroy

burnett
i
cedric
himself
knew
nothing
whatever
about
it
it
had
never
been
even
mentioned
to
him
he
knew
that
his
papa
had
been
an
englishman
because
his
mamma
had
told
him
so
but
then
his
papa
had
died
when
he
was
so
little
a
boy
that
he
could
not
remember
very
much
about
him
except
that
he
was
big
and
had
blue
eyes
and
a
long
mustache
and
that
it
was
a
splendid
thing
to
be
carried
around
the
room
on
his
shoulder
since
his
papa
death
cedric
had
found
out
that
it
was
best
not
to
talk
to
his
mamma
about
him
when
his
father
was
ill
cedric
had
been
sent
away
and
when
he
had
returned
everything
was
over
and
his
mother
who
had
been
very
ill
too
was
only
just
beginning
to
sit
in
her
chair
by
the
window
she
was
pale
and
thin
and
all
the
dimples
had
gone
from
her
pretty
face
and
her
eyes
looked
large
and
mournful
and
she
was
dressed
in
black
dearest
said
cedric
his
papa
had
called
her
that
always
and
so
the
little
boy
had
learned
to
say
it
dearest
is
my
papa
better
he
felt
her
arms
tremble
and
so
he
turned
his
curly
head
and
looked
in
her
face
there
was
something
in
it
that
made
him
feel
that
he
was
going
to
cry
dearest
he
said
is
he
well
then
suddenly
his
loving
little
heart
told
him
that
he
better
put
both
his
arms
around
her
neck
and
kiss
her
again
and
again
and
keep
his
soft
cheek
close
to
hers
and
he
did
so
and
she
laid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
and
cried
bitterly
holding
him
as
if
she
could
never
let
him
go
again
yes
he
is
well
she
sobbed
he
is
quite
quite
well
but
we
we
have
no
one
left
but
each
other
no
one
at
then
little
as
he
was
he
understood
that
his
big
handsome
young
papa
would
not
come
back
any
more
that
he
was
dead
as
he
had
heard
of
other
people
being
although
he
could
not
comprehend
exactly
what
strange
thing
had
brought
all
this
sadness
about
it
was
because
his
mamma
always
cried
when
he
spoke
of
his
papa
that
he
secretly
made
up
his
mind
it
was
better
not
to
speak
of
him
very
often
to
her
and
he
found
out
too
that
it
was
better
not
to
let
her
sit
still
and
look
into
the
fire
or
out
of
the
window
without
moving
or
talking
he
and
his
mamma
knew
very
few
people
and
lived
what
might
have
been
thought
very
lonely
lives
although
cedric
did
not
know
it
was
lonely
until
he
grew
older
and
heard
why
it
was
they
had
no
visitors
then
he
was
told
that
his
mamma
was
an
orphan
and
quite
alone
in
the
world
when
his
papa
had
married
her
she
was
very
pretty
and
had
been
living
as
companion
to
a
rich
old
lady
who
was
not
kind
to
her
and
one
day
captain
cedric
errol
who
was
calling
at
the
house
saw
her
run
up
the
stairs
with
tears
on
her
eyelashes
and
she
looked
so
sweet
and
innocent
and
sorrowful
that
the
captain
could
not
forget
her
and
after
many
strange
things
had
happened
they
knew
each
other
well
and
loved
each
other
dearly
and
were
married
although
their
marriage
brought
them
the
of
several
persons
the
one
who
was
most
angry
of
all
however
was
the
captain
father
who
lived
in
england
and
was
a
very
rich
and
important
old
nobleman
with
a
very
bad
temper
and
a
very
violent
dislike
to
america
and
americans
he
had
two
sons
older
than
captain
cedric
and
it
was
the
law
that
the
elder
of
these
sons
should
inherit
the
family
title
and
estates
which
were
very
rich
and
splendid
if
the
eldest
son
died
the
next
one
would
be
heir
so
though
he
was
a
member
of
such
a
great
family
there
was
little
chance
that
captain
cedric
would
be
very
rich
himself
but
it
so
happened
that
nature
had
given
to
the
youngest
son
gifts
which
she
had
not
bestowed
upon
his
elder
brothers
he
had
a
beautiful
face
and
a
fine
strong
graceful
figure
he
had
a
bright
smile
and
a
sweet
gay
voice
he
was
brave
and
generous
and
had
the
kindest
heart
in
the
world
and
seemed
to
have
the
power
to
make
every
one
love
him
and
it
was
not
so
with
his
elder
brothers
neither
of
them
was
handsome
or
very
kind
or
clever
when
they
were
boys
at
eton
they
were
not
popular
when
they
were
at
college
they
cared
nothing
for
study
and
wasted
both
time
and
money
and
made
few
real
friends
the
old
earl
their
father
was
constantly
disappointed
and
humiliated
by
them
his
heir
was
no
honor
to
his
noble
name
and
did
not
promise
to
end
in
being
anything
but
a
selfish
wasteful
insignificant
man
with
no
manly
or
noble
qualities
it
was
very
bitter
the
old
earl
thought
that
the
son
who
was
only
third
and
would
have
only
a
very
small
fortune
should
be
the
one
who
had
all
the
gifts
and
all
the
charms
and
all
the
strength
and
beauty
sometimes
he
almost
hated
the
handsome
young
man
because
he
seemed
to
have
the
good
things
which
should
have
gone
with
the
stately
title
and
the
magnificent
estates
and
yet
in
the
depths
of
his
proud
stubborn
old
heart
he
could
not
help
caring
very
much
for
his
youngest
son
it
was
in
one
of
his
fits
of
petulance
that
he
sent
him
off
to
travel
in
america
he
thought
he
would
send
him
away
for
a
while
so
that
he
should
not
be
made
angry
by
constantly
contrasting
him
with
his
brothers
who
were
at
that
time
giving
him
a
great
deal
of
trouble
by
their
wild
ways
but
after
about
six
months
he
began
to
feel
lonely
and
longed
in
secret
to
see
his
son
again
so
he
wrote
to
captain
cedric
and
ordered
him
home
the
letter
he
wrote
crossed
on
its
way
a
letter
the
captain
had
just
written
to
his
father
telling
of
his
love
for
the
pretty
american
girl
and
of
his
intended
marriage
and
when
the
earl
received
that
letter
he
was
furiously
angry
bad
as
his
temper
was
he
had
never
given
way
to
it
in
his
life
as
he
gave
way
to
it
when
he
read
the
captain
letter
his
valet
who
was
in
the
room
when
it
came
thought
his
lordship
would
have
a
fit
of
apoplexy
he
was
so
wild
with
anger
for
an
hour
he
raged
like
a
tiger
and
then
he
sat
down
and
wrote
to
his
son
and
ordered
him
never
to
come
near
his
old
home
nor
to
write
to
his
father
or
brothers
again
he
told
him
he
might
live
as
he
pleased
and
die
where
he
pleased
that
he
should
be
cut
off
from
his
family
forever
and
that
he
need
never
expect
help
from
his
father
as
long
as
he
lived
the
captain
was
very
sad
when
he
read
the
letter
he
was
very
fond
of
england
and
he
dearly
loved
the
beautiful
home
where
he
had
been
born
he
had
even
loved
his
old
father
and
had
sympathized
with
him
in
his
disappointments
but
he
knew
he
need
expect
no
kindness
from
him
in
the
future
at
first
he
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
he
had
not
been
brought
up
to
work
and
had
no
business
experience
but
he
had
courage
and
plenty
of
determination
so
he
sold
his
commission
in
the
english
army
and
after
some
trouble
found
a
situation
in
new
york
and
married
the
change
from
his
old
life
in
england
was
very
great
but
he
was
young
and
happy
and
he
hoped
that
hard
work
would
do
great
things
for
him
in
the
future
he
had
a
small
house
on
a
quiet
street
and
his
little
boy
was
born
there
and
everything
was
so
gay
and
cheerful
in
a
simple
way
that
he
was
never
sorry
for
a
moment
that
he
had
married
the
rich
old
lady
pretty
companion
just
because
she
was
so
sweet
and
he
loved
her
and
she
loved
him
she
was
very
sweet
indeed
and
her
little
boy
was
like
both
her
and
his
father
though
he
was
born
in
so
quiet
and
cheap
a
little
home
it
seemed
as
if
there
never
had
been
a
more
fortunate
baby
in
the
first
place
he
was
always
well
and
so
he
never
gave
any
one
trouble
in
the
second
place
he
had
so
sweet
a
temper
and
ways
so
charming
that
he
was
a
pleasure
to
every
one
and
in
the
third
place
he
was
so
beautiful
to
look
at
that
he
was
quite
a
picture
instead
of
being
a
baby
he
started
in
life
with
a
quantity
of
soft
fine
hair
which
curled
up
at
the
ends
and
went
into
loose
rings
by
the
time
he
was
six
months
old
he
had
big
brown
eyes
and
long
eyelashes
and
a
darling
little
face
he
had
so
strong
a
back
and
such
splendid
sturdy
legs
that
at
nine
months
he
learned
suddenly
to
walk
his
manners
were
so
good
for
a
baby
that
it
was
delightful
to
make
his
acquaintance
he
seemed
to
feel
that
every
one
was
his
friend
and
when
any
one
spoke
to
him
when
he
was
in
his
carriage
in
the
street
he
would
give
the
stranger
one
sweet
serious
look
with
the
brown
eyes
and
then
follow
it
with
a
lovely
friendly
smile
and
the
consequence
was
that
there
was
not
a
person
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
quiet
street
where
he
lived
even
to
the
groceryman
at
the
corner
who
was
considered
the
crossest
creature
alive
who
was
not
pleased
to
see
him
and
speak
to
him
and
every
month
of
his
life
he
grew
handsomer
and
more
interesting
when
he
was
old
enough
to
walk
out
with
his
nurse
dragging
a
small
wagon
and
wearing
a
short
white
kilt
skirt
and
a
big
white
hat
set
back
on
his
curly
yellow
hair
he
was
so
handsome
and
strong
and
rosy
that
he
attracted
every
one
attention
and
his
nurse
would
come
home
and
tell
his
mamma
stories
of
the
ladies
who
had
stopped
their
carriages
to
look
at
and
speak
to
him
and
of
how
pleased
they
were
when
he
talked
to
them
in
his
cheerful
little
way
as
if
he
had
known
them
always
his
greatest
charm
was
this
cheerful
fearless
quaint
little
way
of
making
friends
with
people
i
think
it
arose
from
his
having
a
very
confiding
nature
and
a
kind
little
heart
that
sympathized
with
every
one
and
wished
to
make
every
one
as
comfortable
as
he
liked
to
be
himself
it
made
him
very
quick
to
understand
the
feelings
of
those
about
him
perhaps
this
had
grown
on
him
too
because
he
had
lived
so
much
with
his
father
and
mother
who
were
always
loving
and
considerate
and
tender
and
he
had
never
heard
an
unkind
or
uncourteous
word
spoken
at
home
he
had
always
been
loved
and
caressed
and
treated
tenderly
and
so
his
childish
soul
was
full
of
kindness
and
innocent
warm
feeling
he
had
always
heard
his
mamma
called
by
pretty
loving
names
and
so
he
used
them
himself
when
he
spoke
to
her
he
had
always
seen
that
his
papa
watched
over
her
and
took
great
care
of
her
and
so
he
learned
too
to
be
careful
of
her
so
when
he
knew
his
papa
would
come
back
no
more
and
saw
how
very
sad
his
mamma
was
there
gradually
came
into
his
kind
little
heart
the
thought
that
he
must
do
what
he
could
to
make
her
happy
he
was
not
much
more
than
a
baby
but
that
thought
was
in
his
mind
whenever
he
climbed
upon
her
knee
and
kissed
her
and
put
his
curly
head
on
her
neck
and
when
he
brought
his
toys
and
to
show
her
and
when
he
curled
up
quietly
by
her
side
as
she
used
to
lie
on
the
sofa
he
was
not
old
enough
to
know
of
anything
else
to
do
so
he
did
what
he
could
and
was
more
of
a
comfort
to
her
than
he
could
have
understood
oh
mary
he
heard
her
say
once
to
her
old
servant
i
am
sure
he
is
trying
to
help
me
in
his
innocent
way
i
know
he
is
he
looks
at
me
sometimes
with
a
loving
wondering
little
look
as
if
he
were
sorry
for
me
and
then
he
will
come
and
pet
me
or
show
me
something
he
is
such
a
little
man
i
really
think
he
as
he
grew
older
he
had
a
great
many
quaint
little
ways
which
amused
and
interested
people
greatly
he
was
so
much
of
a
companion
for
his
mother
that
she
scarcely
cared
for
any
other
they
used
to
walk
together
and
talk
together
and
play
together
when
he
was
quite
a
little
fellow
he
learned
to
read
and
after
that
he
used
to
lie
on
the
in
the
evening
and
read
aloud
sometimes
stories
and
sometimes
big
books
such
as
older
people
read
and
sometimes
even
the
newspaper
and
often
at
such
times
mary
in
the
kitchen
would
hear
errol
laughing
with
delight
at
the
quaint
things
he
said
and
indade
said
mary
to
the
groceryman

born
and
after
his
father
death

nurse
and
everything
else
she
was
proud
of
his
graceful
strong
little
body
and
his
pretty
manners
and
especially
proud
of
the
bright
curly
hair
which
waved
over
his
forehead
and
fell
in
charming
on
his
shoulders

willing
to

and

he
cedric
did
not
know
that
he
looked
like
a
young
lord
he
did
not
know
what
a
lord
was
his
greatest
friend
was
the
groceryman
at
the
corner
the
cross
groceryman
who
was
never
cross
to
him
his
name
was
hobbs
and
cedric
admired
and
respected
him
very
much
he
thought
him
a
very
rich
and
powerful
person
he
had
so
many
things
in
his
store
prunes
and
figs
and
oranges
and
biscuits
and
he
had
a
horse
and
wagon
cedric
was
fond
of
the
milkman
and
the
baker
and
the
but
he
liked
hobbs
best
of
all
and
was
on
terms
of
such
intimacy
with
him
that
he
went
to
see
him
every
day
and
often
sat
with
him
quite
a
long
time
discussing
the
topics
of
the
hour
it
was
quite
surprising
how
many
things
they
found
to
talk
about
the
fourth
of
july
for
instance
when
they
began
to
talk
about
the
fourth
of
july
there
really
seemed
no
end
to
it
hobbs
had
a
very
bad
opinion
of
the
british
and
he
told
the
whole
story
of
the
revolution
relating
very
wonderful
and
patriotic
stories
about
the
villainy
of
the
enemy
and
the
bravery
of
the
revolutionary
heroes
and
he
even
generously
repeated
part
of
the
declaration
of
independence
cedric
was
so
excited
that
his
eyes
shone
and
his
cheeks
were
red
and
his
curls
were
all
rubbed
and
tumbled
into
a
yellow
mop
he
could
hardly
wait
to
eat
his
dinner
after
he
went
home
he
was
so
anxious
to
tell
his
mamma
it
was
perhaps
hobbs
who
gave
him
his
first
interest
in
politics
hobbs
was
fond
of
reading
the
newspapers
and
so
cedric
heard
a
great
deal
about
what
was
going
on
in
washington
and
hobbs
would
tell
him
whether
the
president
was
doing
his
duty
or
not
and
once
when
there
was
an
election
he
found
it
all
quite
grand
and
probably
but
for
hobbs
and
cedric
the
country
might
have
been
wrecked
hobbs
took
him
to
see
a
great
torchlight
procession
and
many
of
the
men
who
carried
torches
remembered
afterward
a
stout
man
who
stood
near
a
and
held
on
his
shoulder
a
handsome
little
shouting
boy
who
waved
his
cap
in
the
air
it
was
not
long
after
this
election
when
cedric
was
between
seven
and
eight
years
old
that
the
very
strange
thing
happened
which
made
so
wonderful
a
change
in
his
life
it
was
quite
curious
too
that
the
day
it
happened
he
had
been
talking
to
hobbs
about
england
and
the
queen
and
hobbs
had
said
some
very
severe
things
about
the
aristocracy
being
specially
indignant
against
earls
and
marquises
it
had
been
a
hot
morning
and
after
playing
soldiers
with
some
friends
of
his
cedric
had
gone
into
the
store
to
rest
and
had
found
hobbs
looking
very
fierce
over
a
piece
of
the
illustrated
london
news
which
contained
a
picture
of
some
court
ceremony
ah
he
said
that
the
way
they
go
on
now
but
they
get
enough
of
it
some
day
when
those
they
trod
on
rise
and
blow
up
earls
and
marquises
and
all
it
coming
and
they
may
look
out
for
it
cedric
had
perched
himself
as
usual
on
the
high
stool
and
pushed
his
hat
back
and
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
in
delicate
compliment
to
hobbs
did
you
ever
know
many
marquises
hobbs
cedric
inquired
or
earls
no
answered
hobbs
with
indignation
i
guess
not
i
like
to
catch
one
of
inside
here
that
all
i
have
no
grasping
tyrants
sittin
on
my
and
he
was
so
proud
of
the
sentiment
that
he
looked
around
proudly
and
mopped
his
forehead
perhaps
they
would
be
earls
if
they
knew
any
better
said
cedric
feeling
some
vague
sympathy
for
their
unhappy
condition
would
they
said
hobbs
they
just
glory
in
it
it
in
they
a
bad
they
were
in
the
midst
of
their
conversation
when
mary
appeared
cedric
thought
she
had
come
to
buy
some
sugar
perhaps
but
she
had
not
she
looked
almost
pale
and
as
if
she
were
excited
about
something
come
home
darlint
she
said
the
misthress
is
wantin
cedric
slipped
down
from
his
stool
does
she
want
me
to
go
out
with
her
mary
he
asked
hobbs
i
see
you
he
was
surprised
to
see
mary
staring
at
him
in
a
dumfounded
fashion
and
he
wondered
why
she
kept
shaking
her
head
what
the
matter
mary
he
said
is
it
the
hot
weather
no
said
mary
but
there
strange
things
happenin
to
has
the
sun
given
dearest
a
headache
he
inquired
anxiously
but
it
was
not
that
when
he
reached
his
own
house
there
was
a
coupe
standing
before
the
door
and
some
one
was
in
the
little
parlor
talking
to
his
mamma
mary
hurried
him
upstairs
and
put
on
his
best
summer
suit
of
flannel
with
the
red
scarf
around
his
waist
and
combed
out
his
curly
locks
lords
is
it
he
heard
her
say
an
the
nobility
an
gintry
och
bad
cess
to
them
lords
indade
worse
it
was
really
very
puzzling
but
he
felt
sure
his
mamma
would
tell
him
what
all
the
excitement
meant
so
he
allowed
mary
to
bemoan
herself
without
asking
many
questions
when
he
was
dressed
he
ran
downstairs
and
went
into
the
parlor
a
tall
thin
old
gentleman
with
a
sharp
face
was
sitting
in
an
his
mother
was
standing
near
by
with
a
pale
face
and
he
saw
that
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
oh
ceddie
she
cried
out
and
ran
to
her
little
boy
and
caught
him
in
her
arms
and
kissed
him
in
a
frightened
troubled
way
oh
ceddie
darling
the
tall
old
gentleman
rose
from
his
chair
and
looked
at
cedric
with
his
sharp
eyes
he
rubbed
his
thin
chin
with
his
bony
hand
as
he
looked
he
seemed
not
at
all
displeased
and
so
he
said
at
last
slowly
and
so
this
is
little
lord
ii
there
was
never
a
more
amazed
little
boy
than
cedric
during
the
week
that
followed
there
was
never
so
strange
or
so
unreal
a
week
in
the
first
place
the
story
his
mamma
told
him
was
a
very
curious
one
he
was
obliged
to
hear
it
two
or
three
times
before
he
could
understand
it
he
could
not
imagine
what
hobbs
would
think
of
it
it
began
with
earls
his
grandpapa
whom
he
had
never
seen
was
an
earl
and
his
eldest
uncle
if
he
had
not
been
killed
by
a
fall
from
his
horse
would
have
been
an
earl
too
in
time
and
after
his
death
his
other
uncle
would
have
been
an
earl
if
he
had
not
died
suddenly
in
rome
of
a
fever
after
that
his
own
papa
if
he
had
lived
would
have
been
an
earl
but
since
they
all
had
died
and
only
cedric
was
left
it
appeared
that
he
was
to
be
an
earl
after
his
grandpapa
death
and
for
the
present
he
was
lord
fauntleroy
he
turned
quite
pale
when
he
was
first
told
of
it
oh
dearest
he
said
i
should
rather
not
be
an
earl
none
of
the
boys
are
earls
ca
i
not
be
one
but
it
seemed
to
be
unavoidable
and
when
that
evening
they
sat
together
by
the
open
window
looking
out
into
the
shabby
street
he
and
his
mother
had
a
long
talk
about
it
cedric
sat
on
his
footstool
clasping
one
knee
in
his
favorite
attitude
and
wearing
a
bewildered
little
face
rather
red
from
the
exertion
of
thinking
his
grandfather
had
sent
for
him
to
come
to
england
and
his
mamma
thought
he
must
go
because
she
said
looking
out
of
the
window
with
sorrowful
eyes
i
know
your
papa
would
wish
it
to
be
so
ceddie
he
loved
his
home
very
much
and
there
are
many
things
to
be
thought
of
that
a
little
boy
quite
understand
i
should
be
a
selfish
little
mother
if
i
did
not
send
you
when
you
are
a
man
you
will
see
ceddie
shook
his
head
mournfully
i
shall
be
very
sorry
to
leave
hobbs
he
said
i
afraid
miss
me
and
i
shall
miss
him
and
i
shall
miss
them
when
havisham
who
was
the
family
lawyer
of
the
earl
of
dorincourt
and
who
had
been
sent
by
him
to
bring
lord
fauntleroy
to
england
came
the
next
day
cedric
heard
many
things
but
somehow
it
did
not
console
him
to
hear
that
he
was
to
be
a
very
rich
man
when
he
grew
up
and
that
he
would
have
castles
here
and
castles
there
and
great
parks
and
deep
mines
and
grand
estates
and
tenantry
he
was
troubled
about
his
friend
hobbs
and
he
went
to
see
him
at
the
store
soon
after
breakfast
in
great
anxiety
of
mind
he
found
him
reading
the
morning
paper
and
he
approached
him
with
a
grave
demeanor
he
really
felt
it
would
be
a
great
shock
to
hobbs
to
hear
what
had
befallen
him
and
on
his
way
to
the
store
he
had
been
thinking
how
it
would
be
best
to
break
the
news
hello
said
hobbs
mornin
said
cedric
he
did
not
climb
up
on
the
high
stool
as
usual
but
sat
down
on
a
and
clasped
his
knee
and
was
so
silent
for
a
few
moments
that
hobbs
finally
looked
up
inquiringly
over
the
top
of
his
newspaper
hello
he
said
again
cedric
gathered
all
his
strength
of
mind
together
mr
hobbs
he
said
do
you
remember
what
we
were
talking
about
yesterday
morning
well
replied
hobbs
seems
to
me
it
was
yes
said
cedric
but
just
when
mary
came
for
me
you
know
hobbs
rubbed
the
back
of
his
head
we
was
mentioning
queen
victoria
and
the
yes
said
cedric
rather
hesitatingly
and
and
earls
do
you
know
why
yes
returned
hobbs
we
did
touch
up
a
little
so
cedric
flushed
up
to
the
curly
bang
on
his
forehead
nothing
so
embarrassing
as
this
had
ever
happened
to
him
in
his
life
he
was
a
little
afraid
that
it
might
be
a
trifle
embarrassing
to
hobbs
too
you
said
he
proceeded
that
you
would
have
them
sitting
on
your
so
i
did
returned
hobbs
stoutly
and
i
meant
it
let
try
it
that
all
mr
hobbs
said
cedric
one
is
sitting
on
this
box
now
hobbs
almost
jumped
out
of
his
chair
what
he
exclaimed
yes
cedric
announced
with
due
modesty
am
one
or
i
am
going
to
be
i
wo
deceive
hobbs
looked
agitated
he
rose
up
suddenly
and
went
to
look
at
the
thermometer
the
mercury
got
into
your
head
he
exclaimed
turning
back
to
examine
his
young
friend
countenance
it
is
a
hot
day
how
do
you
feel
got
any
pain
when
did
you
begin
to
feel
that
way
he
put
his
big
hand
on
the
little
boy
hair
this
was
more
embarrassing
than
ever
thank
you
said
ceddie
i
all
right
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
my
head
i
sorry
to
say
it
true
hobbs
that
was
what
mary
came
to
take
me
home
for
havisham
was
telling
my
mamma
and
he
is
a
hobbs
sank
into
his
chair
and
mopped
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
one
of
us
has
got
a
sunstroke
he
exclaimed
no
returned
cedric
we
have
we
shall
have
to
make
the
best
of
it
hobbs
havisham
came
all
the
way
from
england
to
tell
us
about
it
my
grandpapa
sent
hobbs
stared
wildly
at
the
innocent
serious
little
face
before
him
who
is
your
grandfather
he
asked
cedric
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
carefully
drew
out
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
something
was
written
in
his
own
round
irregular
hand
i
could
easily
remember
it
so
i
wrote
it
down
on
this
he
said
and
he
read
aloud
slowly
arthur
molyneux
errol
earl
of
dorincourt
that
is
his
name
and
he
lives
in
a
castle
in
two
or
three
castles
i
think
and
my
papa
who
died
was
his
youngest
son
and
i
should
have
been
a
lord
or
an
earl
if
my
papa
had
died
and
my
papa
would
have
been
an
earl
if
his
two
brothers
had
died
but
they
all
died
and
there
is
no
one
but
me
no
boy
and
so
i
have
to
be
one
and
my
grandpapa
has
sent
for
me
to
come
to
hobbs
seemed
to
grow
hotter
and
hotter
he
mopped
his
forehead
and
his
bald
spot
and
breathed
hard
he
began
to
see
that
something
very
remarkable
had
happened
but
when
he
looked
at
the
little
boy
sitting
on
the
with
the
innocent
anxious
expression
in
his
childish
eyes
and
saw
that
he
was
not
changed
at
all
but
was
simply
as
he
had
been
the
day
before
just
a
handsome
cheerful
brave
little
fellow
in
a
blue
suit
and
red
all
this
information
about
the
nobility
bewildered
him
he
was
all
the
more
bewildered
because
cedric
gave
it
with
such
ingenuous
simplicity
and
plainly
without
realizing
himself
how
stupendous
it
was
wha
what
did
you
say
your
name
was
hobbs
inquired
it
cedric
errol
lord
fauntleroy
answered
cedric
that
was
what
havisham
called
me
he
said
when
i
went
into
the
room
so
this
is
little
lord
fauntleroy
well
said
hobbs
i
be
jiggered
this
was
an
exclamation
he
always
used
when
he
was
very
much
astonished
or
excited
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
just
at
that
puzzling
moment
cedric
felt
it
to
be
quite
a
proper
and
suitable
ejaculation
his
respect
and
affection
for
hobbs
were
so
great
that
he
admired
and
approved
of
all
his
remarks
he
had
not
seen
enough
of
society
as
yet
to
make
him
realize
that
sometimes
hobbs
was
not
quite
conventional
he
knew
of
course
that
he
was
different
from
his
mamma
but
then
his
mamma
was
a
lady
and
he
had
an
idea
that
ladies
were
always
different
from
gentlemen
he
looked
at
hobbs
wistfully
england
is
a
long
way
off
is
it
he
asked
it
across
the
atlantic
ocean
hobbs
answered
that
the
worst
of
it
said
cedric
perhaps
i
shall
not
see
you
again
for
a
long
time
i
do
like
to
think
of
that
the
best
of
friends
must
part
said
hobbs
well
said
cedric
we
have
been
friends
for
a
great
many
years
have
we
ever
since
you
was
born
hobbs
answered
you
was
about
six
weeks
old
when
you
was
first
walked
out
on
this
ah
remarked
cedric
with
a
sigh
i
never
thought
i
should
have
to
be
an
earl
then
you
think
said
hobbs
there
no
getting
out
of
it
i
afraid
not
answered
cedric
my
mamma
says
that
my
papa
would
wish
me
to
do
it
but
if
i
have
to
be
an
earl
there
one
thing
i
can
do
i
can
try
to
be
a
good
one
i
not
going
to
be
a
tyrant
and
if
there
is
ever
to
be
another
war
with
america
i
shall
try
to
stop
his
conversation
with
hobbs
was
a
long
and
serious
one
once
having
got
over
the
first
shock
hobbs
was
not
so
rancorous
as
might
have
been
expected
he
endeavored
to
resign
himself
to
the
situation
and
before
the
interview
was
at
an
end
he
had
asked
a
great
many
questions
as
cedric
could
answer
but
few
of
them
he
endeavored
to
answer
them
himself
and
being
fairly
launched
on
the
subject
of
earls
and
marquises
and
lordly
estates
explained
many
things
in
a
way
which
would
probably
have
astonished
havisham
could
that
gentleman
have
heard
it
but
then
there
were
many
things
which
astonished
havisham
he
had
spent
all
his
life
in
england
and
was
not
accustomed
to
american
people
and
american
habits
he
had
been
connected
professionally
with
the
family
of
the
earl
of
dorincourt
for
nearly
forty
years
and
he
knew
all
about
its
grand
estates
and
its
great
wealth
and
importance
and
in
a
cold
way
he
felt
an
interest
in
this
little
boy
who
in
the
future
was
to
be
the
master
and
owner
of
them
all
the
future
earl
of
dorincourt
he
had
known
all
about
the
old
earl
disappointment
in
his
elder
sons
and
all
about
his
fierce
rage
at
captain
american
marriage
and
he
knew
how
he
still
hated
the
gentle
little
widow
and
would
not
speak
of
her
except
with
bitter
and
cruel
words
he
insisted
that
she
was
only
a
common
american
girl
who
had
entrapped
his
son
into
marrying
her
because
she
knew
he
was
an
earl
son
the
old
lawyer
himself
had
more
than
half
believed
this
was
all
true
he
had
seen
a
great
many
selfish
mercenary
people
in
his
life
and
he
had
not
a
good
opinion
of
americans
when
he
had
been
driven
into
the
cheap
street
and
his
coupe
had
stopped
before
the
cheap
small
house
he
had
felt
actually
shocked
it
seemed
really
quite
dreadful
to
think
that
the
future
owner
of
dorincourt
castle
and
wyndham
towers
and
chorlworth
and
all
the
other
stately
splendors
should
have
been
born
and
brought
up
in
an
insignificant
house
in
a
street
with
a
sort
of
at
the
corner
he
wondered
what
kind
of
a
child
he
would
be
and
what
kind
of
a
mother
he
had
he
rather
shrank
from
seeing
them
both
he
had
a
sort
of
pride
in
the
noble
family
whose
legal
affairs
he
had
conducted
so
long
and
it
would
have
annoyed
him
very
much
to
have
found
himself
obliged
to
manage
a
woman
who
would
seem
to
him
a
vulgar
person
with
no
respect
for
her
dead
husband
country
and
the
dignity
of
his
name
it
was
a
very
old
name
and
a
very
splendid
one
and
havisham
had
a
great
respect
for
it
himself
though
he
was
only
a
cold
keen
old
lawyer
when
mary
handed
him
into
the
small
parlor
he
looked
around
it
critically
it
was
plainly
furnished
but
it
had
a
look
there
were
no
cheap
common
ornaments
and
no
cheap
gaudy
pictures
the
few
adornments
on
the
walls
were
in
good
taste
and
about
the
room
were
many
pretty
things
which
a
woman
hand
might
have
made
not
at
all
bad
so
far
he
had
said
to
himself
but
perhaps
the
captain
taste
but
when
errol
came
into
the
room
he
began
to
think
she
herself
might
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
if
he
had
not
been
quite
a
and
stiff
old
gentleman
he
would
probably
have
started
when
he
saw
her
she
looked
in
the
simple
black
dress
fitting
closely
to
her
slender
figure
more
like
a
young
girl
than
the
mother
of
a
boy
of
seven
she
had
a
pretty
sorrowful
young
face
and
a
very
tender
innocent
look
in
her
large
brown
eyes
the
sorrowful
look
that
had
never
quite
left
her
face
since
her
husband
had
died
cedric
was
used
to
seeing
it
there
the
only
times
he
had
ever
seen
it
fade
out
had
been
when
he
was
playing
with
her
or
talking
to
her
and
had
said
some
thing
or
used
some
long
word
he
had
picked
up
out
of
the
newspapers
or
in
his
conversations
with
hobbs
he
was
fond
of
using
long
words
and
he
was
always
pleased
when
they
made
her
laugh
though
he
could
not
understand
why
they
were
laughable
they
were
quite
serious
matters
with
him
the
experience
taught
him
to
read
people
characters
very
shrewdly
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
cedric
mother
he
knew
that
the
old
earl
had
made
a
great
mistake
in
thinking
her
a
vulgar
mercenary
woman
havisham
had
never
been
married
he
had
never
even
been
in
love
but
he
divined
that
this
pretty
young
creature
with
the
sweet
voice
and
sad
eyes
had
married
captain
errol
only
because
she
loved
him
with
all
her
affectionate
heart
and
that
she
had
never
once
thought
it
an
advantage
that
he
was
an
earl
son
and
he
saw
he
should
have
no
trouble
with
her
and
he
began
to
feel
that
perhaps
little
lord
fauntleroy
might
not
be
such
a
trial
to
his
noble
family
after
all
the
captain
had
been
a
handsome
fellow
and
the
young
mother
was
very
pretty
and
perhaps
the
boy
might
be
well
enough
to
look
at
when
he
first
told
errol
what
he
had
come
for
she
turned
very
pale
oh
she
said
will
he
have
to
be
taken
away
from
me
we
love
each
other
so
much
he
is
such
a
happiness
to
me
he
is
all
i
have
i
have
tried
to
be
a
good
mother
to
and
her
sweet
young
voice
trembled
and
the
tears
rushed
into
her
eyes
you
do
not
know
what
he
has
been
to
me
she
said
the
lawyer
cleared
his
throat
i
am
obliged
to
tell
you
he
said
that
the
earl
of
dorincourt
is
not
is
not
very
friendly
toward
you
he
is
an
old
man
and
his
prejudices
are
very
strong
he
has
always
especially
disliked
america
and
americans
and
was
very
much
enraged
by
his
son
marriage
i
am
sorry
to
be
the
bearer
of
so
unpleasant
a
communication
but
he
is
very
fixed
in
his
determination
not
to
see
you
his
plan
is
that
lord
fauntleroy
shall
be
educated
under
his
own
supervision
that
he
shall
live
with
him
the
earl
is
attached
to
dorincourt
castle
and
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
there
he
is
a
victim
to
inflammatory
gout
and
is
not
fond
of
london
lord
fauntleroy
will
therefore
be
likely
to
live
chiefly
at
dorincourt
the
earl
offers
you
as
a
home
court
lodge
which
is
situated
pleasantly
and
is
not
very
far
from
the
castle
he
also
offers
you
a
suitable
income
lord
fauntleroy
will
be
permitted
to
visit
you
the
only
stipulation
is
that
you
shall
not
visit
him
or
enter
the
park
gates
you
see
you
will
not
be
really
separated
from
your
son
and
i
assure
you
madam
the
terms
are
not
so
harsh
as
as
they
might
have
been
the
advantage
of
such
surroundings
and
education
as
lord
fauntleroy
will
have
i
am
sure
you
must
see
will
be
very
he
felt
a
little
uneasy
lest
she
should
begin
to
cry
or
make
a
scene
as
he
knew
some
women
would
have
done
it
embarrassed
and
annoyed
him
to
see
women
cry
but
she
did
not
she
went
to
the
window
and
stood
with
her
face
turned
away
for
a
few
moments
and
he
saw
she
was
trying
to
steady
herself
captain
errol
was
very
fond
of
dorincourt
she
said
at
last
he
loved
england
and
everything
english
it
was
always
a
grief
to
him
that
he
was
parted
from
his
home
he
was
proud
of
his
home
and
of
his
name
he
would
wish
i
know
he
would
wish
that
his
son
should
know
the
beautiful
old
places
and
be
brought
up
in
such
a
way
as
would
be
suitable
to
his
future
then
she
came
back
to
the
table
and
stood
looking
up
at
havisham
very
gently
my
husband
would
wish
it
she
said
it
will
be
best
for
my
little
boy
i
know
i
am
sure
the
earl
would
not
be
so
unkind
as
to
try
to
teach
him
not
to
love
me
and
i
know
even
if
he
tried
that
my
little
boy
is
too
much
like
his
father
to
be
harmed
he
has
a
warm
faithful
nature
and
a
true
heart
he
would
love
me
even
if
he
did
not
see
me
and
so
long
as
we
may
see
each
other
i
ought
not
to
suffer
very
she
thinks
very
little
of
herself
the
lawyer
thought
she
does
not
make
any
terms
for
madam
he
said
aloud
i
respect
your
consideration
for
your
son
he
will
thank
you
for
it
when
he
is
a
man
i
assure
you
lord
fauntleroy
will
be
most
carefully
guarded
and
every
effort
will
be
used
to
insure
his
happiness
the
earl
of
dorincourt
will
be
as
anxious
for
his
comfort
and
as
you
yourself
could
i
hope
said
the
tender
little
mother
in
a
rather
broken
voice
that
his
grandfather
will
love
ceddie
the
little
boy
has
a
very
affectionate
nature
and
he
has
always
been
havisham
cleared
his
throat
again
he
could
not
quite
imagine
the
gouty
old
earl
loving
any
one
very
much
but
he
knew
it
would
be
to
his
interest
to
be
kind
in
his
irritable
way
to
the
child
who
was
to
be
his
heir
he
knew
too
that
if
ceddie
were
at
all
a
credit
to
his
name
his
grandfather
would
be
proud
of
him
lord
fauntleroy
will
be
comfortable
i
am
sure
he
replied
it
was
with
a
view
to
his
happiness
that
the
earl
desired
that
you
should
be
near
enough
to
him
to
see
him
he
did
not
think
it
would
be
discreet
to
repeat
the
exact
words
the
earl
had
used
which
were
in
fact
neither
polite
nor
amiable
havisham
preferred
to
express
his
noble
patron
offer
in
smoother
and
more
courteous
language
he
had
another
slight
shock
when
errol
asked
mary
to
find
her
little
boy
and
bring
him
to
her
and
mary
told
her
where
he
was
sure
i
foind
him
aisy
enough
she
said
for
it
wid
hobbs
he
is
this
minnit
settin
on
his
high
shtool
by
the
counther
talkin
pollytics
most
loikely
or
hisself
among
the
soap
candles
an
pertaties
as
sinsible
an
shwate
as
ye
mr
hobbs
has
known
him
all
his
life
errol
said
to
the
lawyer
he
is
very
kind
to
ceddie
and
there
is
a
great
friendship
between
remembering
the
glimpse
he
had
caught
of
the
store
as
he
passed
it
and
having
a
recollection
of
the
barrels
of
potatoes
and
apples
and
the
various
odds
and
ends
havisham
felt
his
doubts
arise
again
in
england
gentlemen
sons
did
not
make
friends
of
grocerymen
and
it
seemed
to
him
a
rather
singular
proceeding
it
would
be
very
awkward
if
the
child
had
bad
manners
and
a
disposition
to
like
low
company
one
of
the
bitterest
humiliations
of
the
old
earl
life
had
been
that
his
two
elder
sons
had
been
fond
of
low
company
could
it
be
he
thought
that
this
boy
shared
their
bad
qualities
instead
of
his
father
good
qualities
he
was
thinking
uneasily
about
this
as
he
talked
to
errol
until
the
child
came
into
the
room
when
the
door
opened
he
actually
hesitated
a
moment
before
looking
at
cedric
it
would
perhaps
have
seemed
very
queer
to
a
great
many
people
who
knew
him
if
they
could
have
known
the
curious
sensations
that
passed
through
havisham
when
he
looked
down
at
the
boy
who
ran
into
his
mother
arms
he
experienced
a
revulsion
of
feeling
which
was
quite
exciting
he
recognized
in
an
instant
that
here
was
one
of
the
finest
and
handsomest
little
fellows
he
had
ever
seen
his
beauty
was
something
unusual
he
had
a
strong
lithe
graceful
little
body
and
a
manly
little
face
he
held
his
childish
head
up
and
carried
himself
with
a
brave
air
he
was
so
like
his
father
that
it
was
really
startling
he
had
his
father
golden
hair
and
his
brown
eyes
but
there
was
nothing
sorrowful
or
timid
in
them
they
were
innocently
fearless
eyes
he
looked
as
if
he
had
never
feared
or
doubted
anything
in
his
life
he
is
the
and
handsomest
little
fellow
i
ever
saw
was
what
havisham
thought
what
he
said
aloud
was
simply
and
so
this
is
little
lord
and
after
this
the
more
he
saw
of
little
lord
fauntleroy
the
more
of
a
surprise
he
found
him
he
knew
very
little
about
children
though
he
had
seen
plenty
of
them
in
england
fine
handsome
rosy
girls
and
boys
who
were
strictly
taken
care
of
by
their
tutors
and
governesses
and
who
were
sometimes
shy
and
sometimes
a
trifle
boisterous
but
never
very
interesting
to
a
ceremonious
rigid
old
lawyer
perhaps
his
personal
interest
in
little
lord
fauntleroy
fortunes
made
him
notice
ceddie
more
than
he
had
noticed
other
children
but
however
that
was
he
certainly
found
himself
noticing
him
a
great
deal
cedric
did
not
know
he
was
being
observed
and
he
only
behaved
himself
in
his
ordinary
manner
he
shook
hands
with
havisham
in
his
friendly
way
when
they
were
introduced
to
each
other
and
he
answered
all
his
questions
with
the
unhesitating
readiness
with
which
he
answered
hobbs
he
was
neither
shy
nor
bold
and
when
havisham
was
talking
to
his
mother
the
lawyer
noticed
that
he
listened
to
the
conversation
with
as
much
interest
as
if
he
had
been
quite
grown
up
he
seems
to
be
a
very
mature
little
fellow
havisham
said
to
the
mother
i
think
he
is
in
some
things
she
answered
he
has
always
been
very
quick
to
learn
and
he
has
lived
a
great
deal
with
grownup
people
he
has
a
funny
little
habit
of
using
long
words
and
expressions
he
has
read
in
books
or
has
heard
others
use
but
he
is
very
fond
of
childish
play
i
think
he
is
rather
clever
but
he
is
a
very
boyish
little
boy
the
next
time
havisham
met
him
he
saw
that
this
last
was
quite
true
as
his
coupe
turned
the
corner
he
caught
sight
of
a
group
of
small
boys
who
were
evidently
much
excited
two
of
them
were
about
to
run
a
race
and
one
of
them
was
his
young
lordship
and
he
was
shouting
and
making
as
much
noise
as
the
noisiest
of
his
companions
he
stood
side
by
side
with
another
boy
one
little
red
leg
advanced
a
step
one
to
make
ready
yelled
the
starter
two
to
be
steady
three
and
away
havisham
found
himself
leaning
out
of
the
window
of
his
coupe
with
a
curious
feeling
of
interest
he
really
never
remembered
having
seen
anything
quite
like
the
way
in
which
his
lordship
lordly
little
red
legs
flew
up
behind
his
knickerbockers
and
tore
over
the
ground
as
he
shot
out
in
the
race
at
the
signal
word
he
shut
his
small
hands
and
set
his
face
against
the
wind
his
bright
hair
streamed
out
behind
hooray
ced
errol
all
the
boys
shouted
dancing
and
shrieking
with
excitement
hooray
billy
williams
hooray
ceddie
hooray
billy
hooray
i
really
believe
he
is
going
to
win
said
havisham
the
way
in
which
the
red
legs
flew
and
flashed
up
and
down
the
shrieks
of
the
boys
the
wild
efforts
of
billy
williams
whose
brown
legs
were
not
to
be
despised
as
they
followed
closely
in
the
rear
of
the
red
legs
made
him
feel
some
excitement
i
really
i
really
ca
help
hoping
he
will
win
he
said
with
an
apologetic
sort
of
cough
at
that
moment
the
wildest
yell
of
all
went
up
from
the
dancing
hopping
boys
with
one
last
frantic
leap
the
future
earl
of
dorincourt
had
reached
the
at
the
end
of
the
block
and
touched
it
just
two
seconds
before
billy
williams
flung
himself
at
it
panting
three
cheers
for
ceddie
errol
yelled
the
little
boys
hooray
for
ceddie
errol
havisham
drew
his
head
in
at
the
window
of
his
coupe
and
leaned
back
with
a
dry
smile
bravo
lord
fauntleroy
he
said
as
his
carriage
stopped
before
the
door
of
errol
house
the
victor
and
the
vanquished
were
coming
toward
it
attended
by
the
clamoring
crew
cedric
walked
by
billy
williams
and
was
speaking
to
him
his
elated
little
face
was
very
red
his
curls
clung
to
his
hot
moist
forehead
his
hands
were
in
his
pockets
you
see
he
was
saying
evidently
with
the
intention
of
making
defeat
easy
for
his
unsuccessful
rival
i
guess
i
won
because
my
legs
are
a
little
longer
than
yours
i
guess
that
was
it
you
see
i
three
days
older
than
you
and
that
gives
me
a
i
three
days
and
this
view
of
the
case
seemed
to
cheer
billy
williams
so
much
that
he
began
to
smile
on
the
world
again
and
felt
able
to
swagger
a
little
almost
as
if
he
had
won
the
race
instead
of
losing
it
somehow
ceddie
errol
had
a
way
of
making
people
feel
comfortable
even
in
the
first
flush
of
his
triumphs
he
remembered
that
the
person
who
was
beaten
might
not
feel
so
gay
as
he
did
and
might
like
to
think
that
he
might
have
been
the
winner
under
different
circumstances
that
morning
havisham
had
quite
a
long
conversation
with
the
winner
of
the
race
a
conversation
which
made
him
smile
his
dry
smile
and
rub
his
chin
with
his
bony
hand
several
times
errol
had
been
called
out
of
the
parlor
and
the
lawyer
and
cedric
were
left
together
at
first
havisham
wondered
what
he
should
say
to
his
small
companion
he
had
an
idea
that
perhaps
it
would
be
best
to
say
several
things
which
might
prepare
cedric
for
meeting
his
grandfather
and
perhaps
for
the
great
change
that
was
to
come
to
him
he
could
see
that
cedric
had
not
the
least
idea
of
the
sort
of
thing
he
was
to
see
when
he
reached
england
or
of
the
sort
of
home
that
waited
for
him
there
he
did
not
even
know
yet
that
his
mother
was
not
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
him
they
had
thought
it
best
to
let
him
get
over
the
first
shock
before
telling
him
havisham
sat
in
an
on
one
side
of
the
open
window
on
the
other
side
was
another
still
larger
chair
and
cedric
sat
in
that
and
looked
at
havisham
he
sat
well
back
in
the
depths
of
his
big
seat
his
curly
head
against
the
cushioned
back
his
legs
crossed
and
his
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
pockets
in
a
quite
way
he
had
been
watching
havisham
very
steadily
when
his
mamma
had
been
in
the
room
and
after
she
was
gone
he
still
looked
at
him
in
respectful
thoughtfulness
there
was
a
short
silence
after
errol
went
out
and
cedric
seemed
to
be
studying
havisham
and
havisham
was
certainly
studying
cedric
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
as
to
what
an
elderly
gentleman
should
say
to
a
little
boy
who
won
races
and
wore
short
knickerbockers
and
red
stockings
on
legs
which
were
not
long
enough
to
hang
over
a
big
chair
when
he
sat
well
back
in
it
but
cedric
relieved
him
by
suddenly
beginning
the
conversation
himself
do
you
know
he
said
i
do
know
what
an
earl
is
do
you
said
havisham
no
replied
ceddie
and
i
think
when
a
boy
is
going
to
be
one
he
ought
to
know
do
you
well
yes
answered
havisham
would
you
mind
said
ceddie
respectfully
would
you
mind
it
to
me
sometimes
when
he
used
his
long
words
he
did
not
pronounce
them
quite
correctly
what
made
him
an
earl
a
king
or
queen
in
the
first
place
said
havisham
generally
he
is
made
an
earl
because
he
has
done
some
service
to
his
sovereign
or
some
great
oh
said
cedric
that
like
the
is
it
said
havisham
is
that
why
your
presidents
are
elected
yes
answered
ceddie
cheerfully
when
a
man
is
very
good
and
knows
a
great
deal
he
is
elected
president
they
have
processions
and
bands
and
everybody
makes
speeches
i
used
to
think
i
might
perhaps
be
a
president
but
i
never
thought
of
being
an
earl
i
did
know
about
earls
he
said
rather
hastily
lest
havisham
might
feel
it
impolite
in
him
not
to
have
wished
to
be
one
if
i
known
about
them
i
dare
say
i
should
have
thought
i
should
like
to
be
it
is
rather
different
from
being
a
president
said
havisham
is
it
asked
cedric
how
are
there
no
processions
havisham
crossed
his
own
legs
and
put
the
tips
of
his
fingers
carefully
together
he
thought
perhaps
the
time
had
come
to
explain
matters
rather
more
clearly
an
earl
is
is
a
very
important
person
he
began
so
is
a
president
put
in
ceddie
the
processions
are
five
miles
long
and
they
shoot
up
rockets
and
the
band
plays
hobbs
took
me
to
see
an
earl
havisham
went
on
feeling
rather
uncertain
of
his
ground
is
frequently
of
very
ancient
lineage
what
that
asked
ceddie
of
very
old
family
extremely
ah
said
cedric
thrusting
his
hands
deeper
into
his
pockets
i
suppose
that
is
the
way
with
the
near
the
park
i
dare
say
she
is
of
ancient
she
is
so
old
it
would
surprise
you
how
she
can
stand
up
she
a
hundred
i
should
think
and
yet
she
is
out
there
when
it
rains
even
i
sorry
for
her
and
so
are
the
other
boys
billy
williams
once
had
nearly
a
dollar
and
i
asked
him
to
buy
five
cents
worth
of
apples
from
her
every
day
until
he
had
spent
it
all
that
made
twenty
days
and
he
grew
tired
of
apples
after
a
week
but
then
it
was
quite
fortunate
a
gentleman
gave
me
fifty
cents
and
i
bought
apples
from
her
instead
you
feel
sorry
for
any
one
that
so
poor
and
has
such
ancient
she
says
hers
has
gone
into
her
bones
and
the
rain
makes
it
havisham
felt
rather
at
a
loss
as
he
looked
at
his
innocent
serious
little
face
i
am
afraid
you
did
not
quite
understand
me
he
explained
when
i
said
lineage
i
did
not
mean
old
age
i
meant
that
the
name
of
such
a
family
has
been
known
in
the
world
a
long
time
perhaps
for
hundreds
of
years
persons
bearing
that
name
have
been
known
and
spoken
of
in
the
history
of
their
like
george
washington
said
ceddie
i
heard
of
him
ever
since
i
was
born
and
he
was
known
about
long
before
that
hobbs
says
he
will
never
be
forgotten
that
because
of
the
declaration
of
independence
you
know
and
the
fourth
of
july
you
see
he
was
a
very
brave
the
first
earl
of
dorincourt
said
havisham
solemnly
was
created
an
earl
four
hundred
years
well
well
said
ceddie
that
was
a
long
time
ago
did
you
tell
dearest
that
it
would
her
very
much
we
tell
her
when
she
comes
in
she
always
likes
to
hear
things
what
else
does
an
earl
do
besides
being
created
a
great
many
of
them
have
helped
to
govern
england
some
of
them
have
been
brave
men
and
have
fought
in
great
battles
in
the
old
i
should
like
to
do
that
myself
said
cedric
my
papa
was
a
soldier
and
he
was
a
very
brave
man
as
brave
as
george
washington
perhaps
that
was
because
he
would
have
been
an
earl
if
he
had
died
i
am
glad
earls
are
brave
that
a
great
to
be
a
brave
man
once
i
used
to
be
rather
afraid
of
things
in
the
dark
you
know
but
when
i
thought
about
the
soldiers
in
the
revolution
and
george
washington
it
cured
there
is
another
advantage
in
being
an
earl
sometimes
said
havisham
slowly
and
he
fixed
his
shrewd
eyes
on
the
little
boy
with
a
rather
curious
expression
some
earls
have
a
great
deal
of
he
was
curious
because
he
wondered
if
his
young
friend
knew
what
the
power
of
money
was
that
a
good
thing
to
have
said
ceddie
innocently
i
wish
i
had
a
great
deal
of
do
you
said
havisham
and
why
well
explained
cedric
there
are
so
many
things
a
person
can
do
with
money
you
see
there
the
if
i
were
very
rich
i
should
buy
her
a
little
tent
to
put
her
stall
in
and
a
little
stove
and
then
i
should
give
her
a
dollar
every
morning
it
rained
so
that
she
could
afford
to
stay
at
home
and
then
oh
i
give
her
a
shawl
and
you
see
her
bones
would
feel
so
badly
her
bones
are
not
like
our
bones
they
hurt
her
when
she
moves
it
very
painful
when
your
bones
hurt
you
if
i
were
rich
enough
to
do
all
those
things
for
her
i
guess
her
bones
would
be
all
ahem
said
havisham
and
what
else
would
you
do
if
you
were
rich
oh
i
do
a
great
many
things
of
course
i
should
buy
dearest
all
sorts
of
beautiful
things
and
fans
and
gold
thimbles
and
rings
and
an
encyclopedia
and
a
carriage
so
that
she
need
have
to
wait
for
the
if
she
liked
pink
silk
dresses
i
should
buy
her
some
but
she
likes
black
best
but
i
take
her
to
the
big
stores
and
tell
her
to
look
and
choose
for
herself
and
then
dick
who
is
dick
asked
havisham
dick
is
a
said
his
young
lordship
quite
warming
up
in
his
interest
in
plans
so
exciting
he
is
one
of
the
nicest
you
ever
knew
he
stands
at
the
corner
of
a
street
known
him
for
years
once
when
i
was
very
little
i
was
walking
out
with
dearest
and
she
bought
me
a
beautiful
ball
that
bounced
and
i
was
carrying
it
and
it
bounced
into
the
middle
of
the
street
where
the
carriages
and
horses
were
and
i
was
so
disappointed
i
began
to
cry
i
was
very
little
i
had
kilts
on
and
dick
was
blacking
a
man
shoes
and
he
said
and
he
ran
in
between
the
horses
and
caught
the
ball
for
me
and
wiped
it
off
with
his
coat
and
gave
it
to
me
and
said
all
right
young
un
so
dearest
admired
him
very
much
and
so
did
i
and
ever
since
then
when
we
go
we
talk
to
him
he
says
and
i
say
and
then
we
talk
a
little
and
he
tells
me
how
trade
is
it
been
bad
and
what
would
you
like
to
do
for
him
inquired
the
lawyer
rubbing
his
chin
and
smiling
a
queer
smile
well
said
lord
fauntleroy
settling
himself
in
his
chair
with
a
business
air
i
buy
jake
and
who
is
jake
havisham
asked
he
dick
partner
and
he
is
the
worst
partner
a
fellow
could
have
dick
says
so
he
is
a
credit
to
the
business
and
he
is
square
he
cheats
and
that
makes
dick
mad
it
would
make
you
mad
you
know
if
you
were
blacking
boots
as
hard
as
you
could
and
being
square
all
the
time
and
your
partner
was
square
at
all
people
like
dick
but
they
like
jake
and
so
sometimes
they
do
come
twice
so
if
i
were
rich
i
buy
jake
out
and
get
dick
a
sign
he
says
a
sign
goes
a
long
way
and
i
get
him
some
new
clothes
and
new
brushes
and
start
him
out
fair
he
says
all
he
wants
is
to
start
out
there
could
have
been
nothing
more
confiding
and
innocent
than
the
way
in
which
his
small
lordship
told
his
little
story
quoting
his
friend
dick
bits
of
slang
in
the
most
candid
good
faith
he
seemed
to
feel
not
a
shade
of
a
doubt
that
his
elderly
companion
would
be
just
as
interested
as
he
was
himself
and
in
truth
havisham
was
beginning
to
be
greatly
interested
but
perhaps
not
quite
so
much
in
dick
and
the
as
in
this
kind
little
lordling
whose
curly
head
was
so
busy
under
its
yellow
thatch
with
plans
for
his
friends
and
who
seemed
somehow
to
have
forgotten
himself
altogether
is
there
anything
he
began
what
would
you
get
for
yourself
if
you
were
rich
lots
of
things
answered
lord
fauntleroy
briskly
but
first
i
give
mary
some
money
for
bridget
that
her
sister
with
twelve
children
and
a
husband
out
of
work
she
comes
here
and
cries
and
dearest
gives
her
things
in
a
basket
and
then
she
cries
again
and
says
be
on
yez
for
a
beautiful
lady
and
i
think
hobbs
would
like
a
gold
watch
and
chain
to
remember
me
by
and
a
meerschaum
pipe
and
then
i
like
to
get
up
a
a
company
exclaimed
havisham
like
a
republican
rally
explained
cedric
becoming
quite
excited
i
have
torches
and
uniforms
and
things
for
all
the
boys
and
myself
too
and
we
march
you
know
and
drill
that
what
i
should
like
for
myself
if
i
were
the
door
opened
and
errol
came
in
i
am
sorry
to
have
been
obliged
to
leave
you
so
long
she
said
to
havisham
but
a
poor
woman
who
is
in
great
trouble
came
to
see
this
young
gentleman
said
havisham
has
been
telling
me
about
some
of
his
friends
and
what
he
would
do
for
them
if
he
were
bridget
is
one
of
his
friends
said
errol
and
it
is
bridget
to
whom
i
have
been
talking
in
the
kitchen
she
is
in
great
trouble
now
because
her
husband
has
rheumatic
cedric
slipped
down
out
of
his
big
chair
i
think
i
go
and
see
her
he
said
and
ask
her
how
he
is
he
a
nice
man
when
he
is
well
i
obliged
to
him
because
he
once
made
me
a
sword
out
of
wood
he
a
very
talented
he
ran
out
of
the
room
and
havisham
rose
from
his
chair
he
seemed
to
have
something
in
his
mind
which
he
wished
to
speak
of
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
looking
down
at
errol
before
i
left
dorincourt
castle
i
had
an
interview
with
the
earl
in
which
he
gave
me
some
instructions
he
is
desirous
that
his
grandson
should
look
forward
with
some
pleasure
to
his
future
life
in
england
and
also
to
his
acquaintance
with
himself
he
said
that
i
must
let
his
lordship
know
that
the
change
in
his
life
would
bring
him
money
and
the
pleasures
children
enjoy
if
he
expressed
any
wishes
i
was
to
gratify
them
and
to
tell
him
that
his
had
given
him
what
he
wished
i
am
aware
that
the
earl
did
not
expect
anything
quite
like
this
but
if
it
would
give
lord
fauntleroy
pleasure
to
assist
this
poor
woman
i
should
feel
that
the
earl
would
be
displeased
if
he
were
not
for
the
second
time
he
did
not
repeat
the
earl
exact
words
his
lordship
had
indeed
said
make
the
lad
understand
that
i
can
give
him
anything
he
wants
let
him
know
what
it
is
to
be
the
grandson
of
the
earl
of
dorincourt
buy
him
everything
he
takes
a
fancy
to
let
him
have
money
in
his
pockets
and
tell
him
his
grandfather
put
it
his
motives
were
far
from
being
good
and
if
he
had
been
dealing
with
a
nature
less
affectionate
and
than
little
lord
fauntleroy
great
harm
might
have
been
done
and
cedric
mother
was
too
gentle
to
suspect
any
harm
she
thought
that
perhaps
this
meant
that
a
lonely
unhappy
old
man
whose
children
were
dead
wished
to
be
kind
to
her
little
boy
and
win
his
love
and
confidence
and
it
pleased
her
very
much
to
think
that
ceddie
would
be
able
to
help
bridget
it
made
her
happier
to
know
that
the
very
first
result
of
the
strange
fortune
which
had
befallen
her
little
boy
was
that
he
could
do
kind
things
for
those
who
needed
kindness
quite
a
warm
color
bloomed
on
her
pretty
young
face
oh
she
said
that
was
very
kind
of
the
earl
cedric
will
be
so
glad
he
has
always
been
fond
of
bridget
and
michael
they
are
quite
deserving
i
have
often
wished
i
had
been
able
to
help
them
more
michael
is
a
man
when
he
is
well
but
he
has
been
ill
a
long
time
and
needs
expensive
medicines
and
warm
clothing
and
nourishing
food
he
and
bridget
will
not
be
wasteful
of
what
is
given
havisham
put
his
thin
hand
in
his
breast
pocket
and
drew
forth
a
large
there
was
a
queer
look
in
his
keen
face
the
truth
was
he
was
wondering
what
the
earl
of
dorincourt
would
say
when
he
was
told
what
was
the
first
wish
of
his
grandson
that
had
been
granted
he
wondered
what
the
cross
worldly
selfish
old
nobleman
would
think
of
it
i
do
not
know
that
you
have
realized
he
said
that
the
earl
of
dorincourt
is
an
exceedingly
rich
man
he
can
afford
to
gratify
any
caprice
i
think
it
would
please
him
to
know
that
lord
fauntleroy
had
been
indulged
in
any
fancy
if
you
will
call
him
back
and
allow
me
i
shall
give
him
five
pounds
for
these
that
would
be
dollars
exclaimed
errol
it
will
seem
like
wealth
to
them
i
can
scarcely
believe
that
it
is
it
is
quite
true
said
havisham
with
his
dry
smile
a
great
change
has
taken
place
in
your
son
life
a
great
deal
of
power
will
lie
in
his
oh
cried
his
mother
and
he
is
such
a
little
boy
a
very
little
boy
how
can
i
teach
him
to
use
it
well
it
makes
me
half
afraid
my
pretty
little
ceddie
the
lawyer
slightly
cleared
his
throat
it
touched
his
worldly
hard
old
heart
to
see
the
tender
timid
look
in
her
brown
eyes
i
think
madam
he
said
that
if
i
may
judge
from
my
interview
with
lord
fauntleroy
this
morning
the
next
earl
of
dorincourt
will
think
for
others
as
well
as
for
his
noble
self
he
is
only
a
child
yet
but
i
think
he
may
be
then
his
mother
went
for
cedric
and
brought
him
back
into
the
parlor
havisham
heard
him
talking
before
he
entered
the
room
it
rheumatism
he
was
saying
and
that
a
kind
of
rheumatism
that
dreadful
and
he
thinks
about
the
rent
not
being
paid
and
bridget
says
that
makes
the
worse
and
pat
could
get
a
place
in
a
store
if
he
had
some
his
little
face
looked
quite
anxious
when
he
came
in
he
was
very
sorry
for
bridget
dearest
said
you
wanted
me
he
said
to
havisham
i
been
talking
to
havisham
looked
down
at
him
a
moment
he
felt
a
little
awkward
and
undecided
as
cedric
mother
had
said
he
was
a
very
little
boy
the
earl
of
dorincourt
he
began
and
then
he
glanced
involuntarily
at
errol
little
lord
fauntleroy
mother
suddenly
kneeled
down
by
him
and
put
both
her
tender
arms
around
his
childish
body
ceddie
she
said
the
earl
is
your
grandpapa
your
own
papa
father
he
is
very
very
kind
and
he
loves
you
and
wishes
you
to
love
him
because
the
sons
who
were
his
little
boys
are
dead
he
wishes
you
to
be
happy
and
to
make
other
people
happy
he
is
very
rich
and
he
wishes
you
to
have
everything
you
would
like
to
have
he
told
havisham
so
and
gave
him
a
great
deal
of
money
for
you
you
can
give
some
to
bridget
now
enough
to
pay
her
rent
and
buy
michael
everything
is
that
fine
ceddie
is
he
good
and
she
kissed
the
child
on
his
round
cheek
where
the
bright
color
suddenly
flashed
up
in
his
excited
amazement
he
looked
from
his
mother
to
havisham
can
i
have
it
now
he
cried
can
i
give
it
to
her
this
minute
just
havisham
handed
him
the
money
it
was
in
fresh
clean
greenbacks
and
made
a
neat
roll
ceddie
flew
out
of
the
room
with
it
bridget
they
heard
him
shout
as
he
tore
into
the
kitchen
bridget
wait
a
minute
here
some
money
it
for
you
and
you
can
pay
the
rent
my
grandpapa
gave
it
to
me
it
for
you
and
michael
oh
master
ceddie
cried
bridget
in
an
voice
dollars
is
here
where
be
the
misthress
i
think
i
shall
have
to
go
and
explain
it
to
her
errol
said
so
she
too
went
out
of
the
room
and
havisham
was
left
alone
for
a
while
he
went
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
into
the
street
reflectively
he
was
thinking
of
the
old
earl
of
dorincourt
sitting
in
his
great
splendid
gloomy
library
at
the
castle
gouty
and
lonely
surrounded
by
grandeur
and
luxury
but
not
really
loved
by
any
one
because
in
all
his
long
life
he
had
never
really
loved
any
one
but
himself
he
had
been
selfish
and
and
arrogant
and
passionate
he
had
cared
so
much
for
the
earl
of
dorincourt
and
his
pleasures
that
there
had
been
no
time
for
him
to
think
of
other
people
all
his
wealth
and
power
all
the
benefits
from
his
noble
name
and
high
rank
had
seemed
to
him
to
be
things
only
to
be
used
to
amuse
and
give
pleasure
to
the
earl
of
dorincourt
and
now
that
he
was
an
old
man
all
this
excitement
and
had
only
brought
him
ill
health
and
irritability
and
a
dislike
of
the
world
which
certainly
disliked
him
in
spite
of
all
his
splendor
there
was
never
a
more
unpopular
old
nobleman
than
the
earl
of
dorincourt
and
there
could
scarcely
have
been
a
more
lonely
one
he
could
fill
his
castle
with
guests
if
he
chose
he
could
give
great
dinners
and
splendid
hunting
parties
but
he
knew
that
in
secret
the
people
who
would
accept
his
invitations
were
afraid
of
his
frowning
old
face
and
sarcastic
biting
speeches
he
had
a
cruel
tongue
and
a
bitter
nature
and
he
took
pleasure
in
sneering
at
people
and
making
them
feel
uncomfortable
when
he
had
the
power
to
do
so
because
they
were
sensitive
or
proud
or
timid
havisham
knew
his
hard
fierce
ways
by
heart
and
he
was
thinking
of
him
as
he
looked
out
of
the
window
into
the
narrow
quiet
street
and
there
rose
in
his
mind
in
sharp
contrast
the
picture
of
the
cheery
handsome
little
fellow
sitting
in
the
big
chair
and
telling
his
story
of
his
friends
dick
and
the
in
his
generous
innocent
honest
way
and
he
thought
of
the
immense
income
the
beautiful
majestic
estates
the
wealth
and
power
for
good
or
evil
which
in
the
course
of
time
would
lie
in
the
small
chubby
hands
little
lord
fauntleroy
thrust
so
deep
into
his
pockets
it
will
make
a
great
difference
he
said
to
himself
it
will
make
a
great
cedric
and
his
mother
came
back
soon
after
cedric
was
in
high
spirits
he
sat
down
in
his
own
chair
between
his
mother
and
the
lawyer
and
fell
into
one
of
his
quaint
attitudes
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
he
was
glowing
with
enjoyment
of
bridget
relief
and
rapture
she
cried
he
said
she
said
she
was
crying
for
joy
i
never
saw
any
one
cry
for
joy
before
my
grandpapa
must
be
a
very
good
man
i
know
he
was
so
good
a
man
it
more
more
agreeabler
to
be
an
earl
than
i
thought
it
was
i
almost
glad
i
almost
quite
glad
i
going
to
be
iii
cedric
good
opinion
of
the
advantages
of
being
an
earl
increased
greatly
during
the
next
week
it
seemed
almost
impossible
for
him
to
realize
that
there
was
scarcely
anything
he
might
wish
to
do
which
he
could
not
do
easily
in
fact
i
think
it
may
be
said
that
he
did
not
fully
realize
it
at
all
but
at
least
he
understood
after
a
few
conversations
with
havisham
that
he
could
gratify
all
his
nearest
wishes
and
he
proceeded
to
gratify
them
with
a
simplicity
and
delight
which
caused
havisham
much
diversion
in
the
week
before
they
sailed
for
england
he
did
many
curious
things
the
lawyer
long
after
remembered
the
morning
they
went
together
to
pay
a
visit
to
dick
and
the
afternoon
they
so
amazed
the
of
ancient
lineage
by
stopping
before
her
stall
and
telling
her
she
was
to
have
a
tent
and
a
stove
and
a
shawl
and
a
sum
of
money
which
seemed
to
her
quite
wonderful
for
i
have
to
go
to
england
and
be
a
lord
explained
cedric
and
i
should
like
to
have
your
bones
on
my
mind
every
time
it
rained
my
own
bones
never
hurt
so
i
think
i
do
know
how
painful
a
person
bones
can
be
but
i
sympathized
with
you
a
great
deal
and
i
hope
you
be
she
a
very
good
he
said
to
havisham
as
they
walked
away
leaving
the
proprietress
of
the
stall
almost
gasping
for
breath
and
not
at
all
believing
in
her
great
fortune
once
when
i
fell
down
and
cut
my
knee
she
gave
me
an
apple
for
nothing
i
always
remembered
her
for
it
you
know
you
always
remember
people
who
are
kind
to
it
had
never
occurred
to
his
honest
simple
little
mind
that
there
were
people
who
could
forget
kindnesses
the
interview
with
dick
was
quite
exciting
dick
had
just
been
having
a
great
deal
of
trouble
with
jake
and
was
in
low
spirits
when
they
saw
him
his
amazement
when
cedric
calmly
announced
that
they
had
come
to
give
him
what
seemed
a
very
great
thing
to
him
and
would
set
all
his
troubles
right
almost
struck
him
dumb
lord
fauntleroy
manner
of
announcing
the
object
of
his
visit
was
very
simple
and
unceremonious
havisham
was
much
impressed
by
its
directness
as
he
stood
by
and
listened
the
statement
that
his
old
friend
had
become
a
lord
and
was
in
danger
of
being
an
earl
if
he
lived
long
enough
caused
dick
to
so
open
his
eyes
and
mouth
and
start
that
his
cap
fell
off
when
he
picked
it
up
he
uttered
a
rather
singular
exclamation
havisham
thought
it
singular
but
cedric
had
heard
it
before
i
soy
he
said
what
yer
givin
us
this
plainly
embarrassed
his
lordship
a
little
but
he
bore
himself
bravely
everybody
thinks
it
not
true
at
first
he
said
mr
hobbs
thought
i
had
a
sunstroke
i
did
think
i
was
going
to
like
it
myself
but
i
like
it
better
now
i
used
to
it
the
one
who
is
the
earl
now
he
my
grandpapa
and
he
wants
me
to
do
anything
i
like
he
very
kind
if
he
is
an
earl
and
he
sent
me
a
lot
of
money
by
havisham
and
brought
some
to
you
to
buy
jake
and
the
end
of
the
matter
was
that
dick
actually
bought
jake
out
and
found
himself
the
possessor
of
the
business
and
some
new
brushes
and
a
most
astonishing
sign
and
outfit
he
could
not
believe
in
his
good
luck
any
more
easily
than
the
of
ancient
lineage
could
believe
in
hers
he
walked
about
like
a
in
a
dream
he
stared
at
his
young
benefactor
and
felt
as
if
he
might
wake
up
at
any
moment
he
scarcely
seemed
to
realize
anything
until
cedric
put
out
his
hand
to
shake
hands
with
him
before
going
away
well
he
said
and
though
he
tried
to
speak
steadily
there
was
a
little
tremble
in
his
voice
and
he
winked
his
big
brown
eyes
and
i
hope
trade
be
good
i
sorry
i
going
away
to
leave
you
but
perhaps
i
shall
come
back
again
when
i
an
earl
and
i
wish
you
write
to
me
because
we
were
always
good
friends
and
if
you
write
to
me
here
where
you
must
send
your
and
he
gave
him
a
slip
of
paper
and
my
name
is
cedric
errol
any
more
it
lord
fauntleroy
and
and
dick
winked
his
eyes
also
and
yet
they
looked
rather
moist
about
the
lashes
he
was
not
an
educated
and
he
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
tell
what
he
felt
just
then
if
he
had
tried
perhaps
that
was
why
he
did
try
and
only
winked
his
eyes
and
swallowed
a
lump
in
his
throat
i
wish
ye
was
goin
away
he
said
in
a
husky
voice
then
he
winked
his
eyes
again
then
he
looked
at
havisham
and
touched
his
cap
thanky
sir
fur
bringin
him
down
here
an
fur
wot
ye
done
he
he
a
queer
little
feller
he
added
i
allers
thort
a
heap
of
him
he
such
a
game
little
feller
an
an
such
a
queer
little
and
when
they
turned
away
he
stood
and
looked
after
them
in
a
dazed
kind
of
way
and
there
was
still
a
mist
in
his
eyes
and
a
lump
in
his
throat
as
he
watched
the
gallant
little
figure
marching
gayly
along
by
the
side
of
its
tall
rigid
escort
until
the
day
of
his
departure
his
lordship
spent
as
much
time
as
possible
with
hobbs
in
the
store
gloom
had
settled
upon
hobbs
he
was
much
depressed
in
spirits
when
his
young
friend
brought
to
him
in
triumph
the
parting
gift
of
a
gold
watch
and
chain
hobbs
found
it
difficult
to
acknowledge
it
properly
he
laid
the
case
on
his
stout
knee
and
blew
his
nose
violently
several
times
there
something
written
on
it
said
cedric
inside
the
case
i
told
the
man
myself
what
to
say
his
oldest
friend
lord
fauntleroy
to
hobbs
when
this
you
see
remember
me
i
do
want
you
to
forget
hobbs
blew
his
nose
very
loudly
again
i
forget
you
he
said
speaking
a
trifle
huskily
as
dick
had
spoken
nor
do
you
go
and
forget
me
when
you
get
among
the
british
i
should
forget
you
whoever
i
was
among
answered
his
lordship
i
spent
my
happiest
hours
with
you
at
least
some
of
my
happiest
hours
i
hope
you
come
to
see
me
sometime
i
sure
my
grandpapa
would
be
very
much
pleased
perhaps
he
write
and
ask
you
when
i
tell
him
about
you
you
you
would
mind
his
being
an
earl
would
you
i
mean
you
would
stay
away
just
because
he
was
one
if
he
invited
you
to
come
i
come
to
see
you
replied
hobbs
graciously
so
it
seemed
to
be
agreed
that
if
he
received
a
pressing
invitation
from
the
earl
to
come
and
spend
a
few
months
at
dorincourt
castle
he
was
to
lay
aside
his
republican
prejudices
and
pack
his
valise
at
once
at
last
all
the
preparations
were
complete
the
day
came
when
the
trunks
were
taken
to
the
steamer
and
the
hour
arrived
when
the
carriage
stood
at
the
door
then
a
curious
feeling
of
loneliness
came
upon
the
little
boy
his
mamma
had
been
shut
up
in
her
room
for
some
time
when
she
came
down
the
stairs
her
eyes
looked
large
and
wet
and
her
sweet
mouth
was
trembling
cedric
went
to
her
and
she
bent
down
to
him
and
he
put
his
arms
around
her
and
they
kissed
each
other
he
knew
something
made
them
both
sorry
though
he
scarcely
knew
what
it
was
but
one
tender
little
thought
rose
to
his
lips
we
liked
this
little
house
dearest
did
we
he
said
we
always
will
like
it
wo
we
yes
yes
she
answered
in
a
low
sweet
voice
yes
and
then
they
went
into
the
carriage
and
cedric
sat
very
close
to
her
and
as
she
looked
back
out
of
the
window
he
looked
at
her
and
stroked
her
hand
and
held
it
close
and
then
it
seemed
almost
directly
they
were
on
the
steamer
in
the
midst
of
the
wildest
bustle
and
confusion
carriages
were
driving
down
and
leaving
passengers
passengers
were
getting
into
a
state
of
excitement
about
baggage
which
had
not
arrived
and
threatened
to
be
too
late
big
trunks
and
cases
were
being
bumped
down
and
dragged
about
sailors
were
uncoiling
ropes
and
hurrying
to
and
fro
officers
were
giving
orders
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
children
and
nurses
were
coming
on
board
some
were
laughing
and
looked
gay
some
were
silent
and
sad
here
and
there
two
or
three
were
crying
and
touching
their
eyes
with
their
handkerchiefs
cedric
found
something
to
interest
him
on
every
side
he
looked
at
the
piles
of
rope
at
the
furled
sails
at
the
tall
tall
masts
which
seemed
almost
to
touch
the
hot
blue
sky
he
began
to
make
plans
for
conversing
with
the
sailors
and
gaining
some
information
on
the
subject
of
pirates
it
was
just
at
the
very
last
when
he
was
standing
leaning
on
the
railing
of
the
upper
deck
and
watching
the
final
preparations
enjoying
the
excitement
and
the
shouts
of
the
sailors
and
wharfmen
that
his
attention
was
called
to
a
slight
bustle
in
one
of
the
groups
not
far
from
him
some
one
was
hurriedly
forcing
his
way
through
this
group
and
coming
toward
him
it
was
a
boy
with
something
red
in
his
hand
it
was
dick
he
came
up
to
cedric
quite
breathless
i
run
all
the
way
he
said
i
come
down
to
see
ye
off
been
prime
i
bought
this
for
ye
out
o
what
i
made
yesterday
ye
kin
wear
it
when
ye
get
among
the
swells
i
lost
the
paper
when
i
was
to
get
through
them
fellers
downstairs
they
did
want
to
let
me
up
it
a
he
poured
it
all
forth
as
if
in
one
sentence
a
bell
rang
and
he
made
a
leap
away
before
cedric
had
time
to
speak
he
panted
wear
it
when
ye
get
among
the
and
he
darted
off
and
was
gone
a
few
seconds
later
they
saw
him
struggle
through
the
crowd
on
the
lower
deck
and
rush
on
shore
just
before
the
was
drawn
in
he
stood
on
the
wharf
and
waved
his
cap
cedric
held
the
handkerchief
in
his
hand
it
was
of
bright
red
silk
ornamented
with
purple
horseshoes
and
horses
heads
there
was
a
great
straining
and
creaking
and
confusion
the
people
on
the
wharf
began
to
shout
to
their
friends
and
the
people
on
the
steamer
shouted
back
old
fellow
every
one
seemed
to
be
saying
do
forget
us
write
when
you
get
to
liverpool
little
lord
fauntleroy
leaned
forward
and
waved
the
red
handkerchief
dick
he
shouted
lustily
thank
you
dick
and
the
big
steamer
moved
away
and
the
people
cheered
again
and
cedric
mother
drew
the
veil
over
her
eyes
and
on
the
shore
there
was
left
great
confusion
but
dick
saw
nothing
save
that
bright
childish
face
and
the
bright
hair
that
the
sun
shone
on
and
the
breeze
lifted
and
he
heard
nothing
but
the
hearty
childish
voice
calling
dick
as
little
lord
fauntleroy
steamed
slowly
away
from
the
home
of
his
birth
to
the
unknown
land
of
his
ancestors
iv
it
was
during
the
voyage
that
cedric
mother
told
him
that
his
home
was
not
to
be
hers
and
when
he
first
understood
it
his
grief
was
so
great
that
havisham
saw
that
the
earl
had
been
wise
in
making
the
arrangements
that
his
mother
should
be
quite
near
him
and
see
him
often
for
it
was
very
plain
he
could
not
have
borne
the
separation
otherwise
but
his
mother
managed
the
little
fellow
so
sweetly
and
lovingly
and
made
him
feel
that
she
would
be
so
near
him
that
after
a
while
he
ceased
to
be
oppressed
by
the
fear
of
any
real
parting
my
house
is
not
far
from
the
castle
ceddie
she
repeated
each
time
the
subject
was
referred
to
a
very
little
way
from
yours
and
you
can
always
run
in
and
see
me
every
day
and
you
will
have
so
many
things
to
tell
me
and
we
shall
be
so
happy
together
it
is
a
beautiful
place
your
papa
has
often
told
me
about
it
he
loved
it
very
much
and
you
will
love
it
i
should
love
it
better
if
you
were
there
his
small
lordship
said
with
a
heavy
little
sigh
he
could
not
but
feel
puzzled
by
so
strange
a
state
of
affairs
which
could
put
his
dearest
in
one
house
and
himself
in
another
the
fact
was
that
errol
had
thought
it
better
not
to
tell
him
why
this
plan
had
been
made
i
should
prefer
he
should
not
be
told
she
said
to
havisham
he
would
not
really
understand
he
would
only
be
shocked
and
hurt
and
i
feel
sure
that
his
feeling
for
the
earl
will
be
a
more
natural
and
affectionate
one
if
he
does
not
know
that
his
grandfather
dislikes
me
so
bitterly
he
has
never
seen
hatred
or
hardness
and
it
would
be
a
great
blow
to
him
to
find
out
that
any
one
could
hate
me
he
is
so
loving
himself
and
i
am
so
dear
to
him
it
is
better
for
him
that
he
should
not
be
told
until
he
is
much
older
and
it
is
far
better
for
the
earl
it
would
make
a
barrier
between
them
even
though
ceddie
is
such
a
so
cedric
only
knew
that
there
was
some
mysterious
reason
for
the
arrangement
some
reason
which
he
was
not
old
enough
to
understand
but
which
would
be
explained
when
he
was
older
he
was
puzzled
but
after
all
it
was
not
the
reason
he
cared
about
so
much
and
after
many
talks
with
his
mother
in
which
she
comforted
him
and
placed
before
him
the
bright
side
of
the
picture
the
dark
side
of
it
gradually
began
to
fade
out
though
now
and
then
havisham
saw
him
sitting
in
some
queer
little
attitude
watching
the
sea
with
a
very
grave
face
and
more
than
once
he
heard
an
unchildish
sigh
rise
to
his
lips
i
do
like
it
he
said
once
as
he
was
having
one
of
his
almost
venerable
talks
with
the
lawyer
you
do
know
how
much
i
do
like
it
but
there
are
a
great
many
troubles
in
this
world
and
you
have
to
bear
them
mary
says
so
and
i
heard
hobbs
say
it
too
and
dearest
wants
me
to
like
to
live
with
my
grandpapa
because
you
see
all
his
children
are
dead
and
that
very
mournful
it
makes
you
sorry
for
a
man
when
all
his
children
have
died
and
one
was
killed
one
of
the
things
which
always
delighted
the
people
who
made
the
acquaintance
of
his
young
lordship
was
the
sage
little
air
he
wore
at
times
when
he
gave
himself
up
to
conversation
combined
with
his
occasionally
elderly
remarks
and
the
extreme
innocence
and
seriousness
of
his
round
childish
face
it
was
irresistible
he
was
such
a
handsome
blooming
little
fellow
that
when
he
sat
down
and
nursed
his
knee
with
his
chubby
hands
and
conversed
with
much
gravity
he
was
a
source
of
great
entertainment
to
his
hearers
gradually
havisham
had
begun
to
derive
a
great
deal
of
private
pleasure
and
amusement
from
his
society
and
so
you
are
going
to
try
to
like
the
earl
he
said
yes
answered
his
lordship
he
my
relation
and
of
course
you
have
to
like
your
relations
and
besides
he
been
very
kind
to
me
when
a
person
does
so
many
things
for
you
and
wants
you
to
have
everything
you
wish
for
of
course
you
like
him
if
he
was
your
relation
but
when
he
your
relation
and
does
that
why
you
very
fond
of
do
you
think
suggested
havisham
that
he
will
be
fond
of
you
well
said
cedric
i
think
he
will
because
you
see
i
his
relation
too
and
i
his
boy
little
boy
besides
and
well
you
see
of
course
he
must
be
fond
of
me
now
or
he
would
want
me
to
have
everything
that
i
like
and
he
would
have
sent
you
for
oh
remarked
the
lawyer
that
it
is
it
yes
said
cedric
that
it
do
you
think
that
it
too
of
course
a
man
would
be
fond
of
his
the
people
who
had
been
seasick
had
no
sooner
recovered
from
their
seasickness
and
come
on
deck
to
recline
in
their
and
enjoy
themselves
than
every
one
seemed
to
know
the
romantic
story
of
little
lord
fauntleroy
and
every
one
took
an
interest
in
the
little
fellow
who
ran
about
the
ship
or
walked
with
his
mother
or
the
tall
thin
old
lawyer
or
talked
to
the
sailors
every
one
liked
him
he
made
friends
everywhere
he
was
ever
ready
to
make
friends
when
the
gentlemen
walked
up
and
down
the
deck
and
let
him
walk
with
them
he
stepped
out
with
a
manly
sturdy
little
tramp
and
answered
all
their
jokes
with
much
gay
enjoyment
when
the
ladies
talked
to
him
there
was
always
laughter
in
the
group
of
which
he
was
the
center
when
he
played
with
the
children
there
was
always
magnificent
fun
on
hand
among
the
sailors
he
had
the
heartiest
friends
he
heard
miraculous
stories
about
pirates
and
shipwrecks
and
desert
islands
he
learned
to
splice
ropes
and
rig
toy
ships
and
gained
an
amount
of
information
concerning
and
quite
surprising
his
conversation
had
indeed
quite
a
nautical
flavor
at
times
and
on
one
occasion
he
raised
a
shout
of
laughter
in
a
group
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
were
sitting
on
deck
wrapped
in
shawls
and
overcoats
by
saying
sweetly
and
with
a
very
engaging
expression
shiver
my
timbers
but
it
a
cold
day
it
surprised
him
when
they
laughed
he
had
picked
up
this
remark
from
an
elderly
naval
man
of
the
name
of
jerry
who
told
him
stories
in
which
it
occurred
frequently
to
judge
from
his
stories
of
his
own
adventures
jerry
had
made
some
two
or
three
thousand
voyages
and
had
been
invariably
shipwrecked
on
each
occasion
on
an
island
densely
populated
with
bloodthirsty
cannibals
judging
also
by
these
same
exciting
adventures
he
had
been
partially
roasted
and
eaten
frequently
and
had
been
scalped
some
fifteen
or
twenty
times
that
is
why
he
is
so
bald
explained
lord
fauntleroy
to
his
mamma
after
you
have
been
scalped
several
times
the
hair
never
grows
again
jerry
never
grew
again
after
that
last
time
when
the
king
of
the
parromachaweekins
did
it
with
the
knife
made
out
of
the
skull
of
the
chief
of
the
wopslemumpkies
he
says
it
was
one
of
the
most
serious
times
he
ever
had
he
was
so
frightened
that
his
hair
stood
right
straight
up
when
the
king
flourished
his
knife
and
it
never
would
lie
down
and
the
king
wears
it
that
way
now
and
it
looks
something
like
a
i
never
heard
anything
like
the
asperiences
jerry
has
had
i
should
so
like
to
tell
hobbs
about
them
sometimes
when
the
weather
was
very
disagreeable
and
people
were
kept
below
decks
in
the
saloon
a
party
of
his
friends
would
persuade
him
to
tell
them
some
of
these
asperiences
of
jerry
and
as
he
sat
relating
them
with
great
delight
and
fervor
there
was
certainly
no
more
popular
voyager
on
any
ocean
steamer
crossing
the
atlantic
than
little
lord
fauntleroy
he
was
always
innocently
and
ready
to
do
his
small
best
to
add
to
the
general
entertainment
and
there
was
a
charm
in
the
very
unconsciousness
of
his
own
childish
importance
jerry
stories
them
very
much
he
said
to
his
mamma
for
my
part
you
must
excuse
me
dearest
but
sometimes
i
should
have
thought
they
could
be
all
quite
true
if
they
had
happened
to
jerry
himself
but
as
they
all
happened
to
jerry
well
it
very
strange
you
know
and
perhaps
sometimes
he
may
forget
and
be
a
little
mistaken
as
he
been
scalped
so
often
being
scalped
a
great
many
times
might
make
a
person
it
was
eleven
days
after
he
had
said
to
his
friend
dick
before
he
reached
liverpool
and
it
was
on
the
night
of
the
twelfth
day
that
the
carriage
in
which
he
and
his
mother
and
havisham
had
driven
from
the
station
stopped
before
the
gates
of
court
lodge
they
could
not
see
much
of
the
house
in
the
darkness
cedric
only
saw
that
there
was
a
under
great
arching
trees
and
after
the
carriage
had
rolled
down
this
a
short
distance
he
saw
an
open
door
and
a
stream
of
bright
light
coming
through
it
mary
had
come
with
them
to
attend
her
mistress
and
she
had
reached
the
house
before
them
when
cedric
jumped
out
of
the
carriage
he
saw
one
or
two
servants
standing
in
the
wide
bright
hall
and
mary
stood
in
the
lord
fauntleroy
sprang
at
her
with
a
gay
little
shout
did
you
get
here
mary
he
said
here
mary
dearest
and
he
kissed
the
maid
on
her
rough
red
cheek
i
am
glad
you
are
here
mary
errol
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
it
is
such
a
comfort
to
me
to
see
you
it
takes
the
strangeness
and
she
held
out
her
little
hand
which
mary
squeezed
encouragingly
she
knew
how
this
first
strangeness
must
feel
to
this
little
mother
who
had
left
her
own
land
and
was
about
to
give
up
her
child
the
english
servants
looked
with
curiosity
at
both
the
boy
and
his
mother
they
had
heard
all
sorts
of
rumors
about
them
both
they
knew
how
angry
the
old
earl
had
been
and
why
errol
was
to
live
at
the
lodge
and
her
little
boy
at
the
castle
they
knew
all
about
the
great
fortune
he
was
to
inherit
and
about
the
savage
old
grandfather
and
his
gout
and
his
tempers
he
have
no
easy
time
of
it
poor
little
chap
they
had
said
among
themselves
but
they
did
not
know
what
sort
of
a
little
lord
had
come
among
them
they
did
not
quite
understand
the
character
of
the
next
earl
of
dorincourt
he
pulled
off
his
overcoat
quite
as
if
he
were
used
to
doing
things
for
himself
and
began
to
look
about
him
he
looked
about
the
broad
hall
at
the
pictures
and
stags
antlers
and
curious
things
that
ornamented
it
they
seemed
curious
to
him
because
he
had
never
seen
such
things
before
in
a
private
house
dearest
he
said
this
is
a
very
pretty
house
is
it
i
am
glad
you
are
going
to
live
here
it
quite
a
large
it
was
quite
a
large
house
compared
to
the
one
in
the
shabby
new
york
street
and
it
was
very
pretty
and
cheerful
mary
led
them
upstairs
to
a
bright
bedroom
where
a
fire
was
burning
and
a
large
persian
cat
was
sleeping
luxuriously
on
the
white
fur
it
was
the
up
at

felly
niver
sthipped
in
when
they
were
ready
they
went
downstairs
into
another
big
bright
room
its
ceiling
was
low
and
the
furniture
was
heavy
and
beautifully
carved
the
chairs
were
deep
and
had
high
massive
backs
and
there
were
queer
shelves
and
cabinets
with
strange
pretty
ornaments
on
them
there
was
a
great
before
the
fire
and
an
on
each
side
of
it
the
stately
white
cat
had
responded
to
lord
fauntleroy
stroking
and
followed
him
downstairs
and
when
he
threw
himself
down
upon
the
rug
she
curled
herself
up
grandly
beside
him
as
if
she
intended
to
make
friends
cedric
was
so
pleased
that
he
put
his
head
down
by
hers
and
lay
stroking
her
not
noticing
what
his
mother
and
havisham
were
saying
they
were
indeed
speaking
in
a
rather
low
tone
errol
looked
a
little
pale
and
agitated
he
need
not
go
she
said
he
will
stay
with
me
yes
answered
havisham
in
the
same
low
tone
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
him
to
go
i
myself
will
go
to
the
castle
as
soon
as
we
have
dined
and
inform
the
earl
of
our
errol
glanced
down
at
cedric
he
was
lying
in
a
graceful
careless
attitude
upon
the
skin
the
fire
shone
on
his
handsome
flushed
little
face
and
on
the
tumbled
curly
hair
spread
out
on
the
rug
the
big
cat
was
purring
in
drowsy
content
she
liked
the
caressing
touch
of
the
kind
little
hand
on
her
fur
errol
smiled
faintly
his
lordship
does
not
know
all
that
he
is
taking
from
me
she
said
rather
sadly
then
she
looked
at
the
lawyer
will
you
tell
him
if
you
please
she
said
that
i
should
rather
not
have
the
money
the
money
havisham
exclaimed
you
can
not
mean
the
income
he
proposed
to
settle
upon
you
yes
she
answered
quite
simply
i
think
i
should
rather
not
have
it
i
am
obliged
to
accept
the
house
and
i
thank
him
for
it
because
it
makes
it
possible
for
me
to
be
near
my
child
but
i
have
a
little
money
of
my
own
enough
to
live
simply
upon
and
i
should
rather
not
take
the
other
as
he
dislikes
me
so
much
i
should
feel
a
little
as
if
i
were
selling
cedric
to
him
i
am
giving
him
up
only
because
i
love
him
enough
to
forget
myself
for
his
good
and
because
his
father
would
wish
it
to
be
havisham
rubbed
his
chin
this
is
very
strange
he
said
he
will
be
very
angry
he
understand
i
think
he
will
understand
it
after
he
thinks
it
over
she
said
i
do
not
really
need
the
money
and
why
should
i
accept
luxuries
from
the
man
who
hates
me
so
much
that
he
takes
my
little
boy
from
me
his
child
havisham
looked
reflective
for
a
few
moments
i
will
deliver
your
message
he
said
afterward
and
then
the
dinner
was
brought
in
and
they
sat
down
together
the
big
cat
taking
a
seat
on
a
chair
near
cedric
and
purring
majestically
throughout
the
meal
when
later
in
the
evening
havisham
presented
himself
at
the
castle
he
was
taken
at
once
to
the
earl
he
found
him
sitting
by
the
fire
in
a
luxurious
his
foot
on
a
he
looked
at
the
lawyer
sharply
from
under
his
shaggy
eyebrows
but
havisham
could
see
that
in
spite
of
his
pretense
at
calmness
he
was
nervous
and
secretly
excited
well
he
said
well
havisham
come
back
have
you
what
the
news
lord
fauntleroy
and
his
mother
are
at
court
lodge
replied
havisham
they
bore
the
voyage
very
well
and
are
in
excellent
the
earl
made
a
sound
and
moved
his
hand
restlessly
glad
to
hear
it
he
said
brusquely
so
far
so
good
make
yourself
comfortable
have
a
glass
of
wine
and
settle
down
what
else
his
lordship
remains
with
his
mother
i
will
bring
him
to
the
the
earl
elbow
was
resting
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
he
put
his
hand
up
and
shielded
his
eyes
with
it
well
he
said
go
on
you
know
i
told
you
not
to
write
to
me
about
the
matter
and
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
what
kind
of
a
lad
is
he
i
do
care
about
the
mother
what
sort
of
a
lad
is
he
havisham
drank
a
little
of
the
glass
of
port
he
had
poured
out
for
himself
and
sat
holding
it
in
his
hand
it
is
rather
difficult
to
judge
of
the
character
of
a
child
of
seven
he
said
cautiously
the
earl
prejudices
were
very
intense
he
looked
up
quickly
and
uttered
a
rough
word
a
fool
is
he
he
exclaimed
or
a
clumsy
cub
his
american
blood
tells
does
it
i
do
not
think
it
has
injured
him
my
lord
replied
the
lawyer
in
his
dry
deliberate
fashion
i
do
know
much
about
children
but
i
thought
him
rather
a
fine
his
manner
of
speech
was
always
deliberate
and
unenthusiastic
but
he
made
it
a
trifle
more
so
than
usual
he
had
a
shrewd
fancy
that
it
would
be
better
that
the
earl
should
judge
for
himself
and
be
quite
unprepared
for
his
first
interview
with
his
grandson
healthy
and
asked
my
lord
apparently
very
healthy
and
quite
replied
the
lawyer
and
well
enough
to
look
at
demanded
the
earl
a
very
slight
smile
touched
havisham
thin
lips
there
rose
up
before
his
mind
eye
the
picture
he
had
left
at
court
lodge
the
beautiful
graceful
child
body
lying
upon
the
in
careless
comfort
the
bright
tumbled
hair
spread
on
the
rug
the
bright
rosy
boy
face
rather
a
handsome
boy
i
think
my
lord
as
boys
go
he
said
though
i
am
scarcely
a
judge
perhaps
but
you
will
find
him
somewhat
different
from
most
english
children
i
dare
i
have
a
doubt
of
that
snarled
the
earl
a
twinge
of
gout
seizing
him
a
lot
of
impudent
little
beggars
those
american
children
heard
that
often
it
is
not
exactly
impudence
in
his
case
said
havisham
i
can
scarcely
describe
what
the
difference
is
he
has
lived
more
with
older
people
than
with
children
and
the
difference
seems
to
be
a
mixture
of
maturity
and
american
impudence
protested
the
earl
i
heard
of
it
before
they
call
it
precocity
and
freedom
beastly
impudent
bad
manners
what
it
is
havisham
drank
some
more
port
he
seldom
argued
with
his
lordly
patron
never
when
his
lordly
patron
noble
leg
was
inflamed
by
gout
at
such
times
it
was
always
better
to
leave
him
alone
so
there
was
a
silence
of
a
few
moments
it
was
havisham
who
broke
it
i
have
a
message
to
deliver
from
errol
he
remarked
i
do
want
any
of
her
messages
growled
his
lordship
the
less
i
hear
of
her
the
this
is
a
rather
important
one
explained
the
lawyer
she
prefers
not
to
accept
the
income
you
proposed
to
settle
on
the
earl
started
visibly
what
that
he
cried
out
what
that
havisham
repeated
his
words
she
says
it
is
not
necessary
and
that
as
the
relations
between
you
are
not
friendly
not
friendly
ejaculated
my
lord
savagely
i
should
say
they
were
not
friendly
i
hate
to
think
of
her
a
mercenary
american
i
do
wish
to
see
my
lord
said
havisham
you
can
scarcely
call
her
mercenary
she
has
asked
for
nothing
she
does
not
accept
the
money
you
offer
all
done
for
effect
snapped
his
noble
lordship
she
wants
to
wheedle
me
into
seeing
her
she
thinks
i
shall
admire
her
spirit
i
do
admire
it
it
only
american
independence
i
wo
have
her
living
like
a
beggar
at
my
park
gates
as
she
the
boy
mother
she
has
a
position
to
keep
up
and
she
shall
keep
it
up
she
shall
have
the
money
whether
she
likes
it
or
not
she
wo
spend
it
said
havisham
i
do
care
whether
she
spends
it
or
not
blustered
my
lord
she
shall
have
it
sent
to
her
she
tell
people
that
she
has
to
live
like
a
pauper
because
i
have
done
nothing
for
her
she
wants
to
give
the
boy
a
bad
opinion
of
me
i
suppose
she
has
poisoned
his
mind
against
me
already
no
said
havisham
i
have
another
message
which
will
prove
to
you
that
she
has
not
done
i
do
want
to
hear
it
panted
the
earl
out
of
breath
with
anger
and
excitement
and
gout
but
havisham
delivered
it
she
asks
you
not
to
let
lord
fauntleroy
hear
anything
which
would
lead
him
to
understand
that
you
separate
him
from
her
because
of
your
prejudice
against
her
he
is
very
fond
of
her
and
she
is
convinced
that
it
would
cause
a
barrier
to
exist
between
you
she
says
he
would
not
comprehend
it
and
it
might
make
him
fear
you
in
some
measure
or
at
least
cause
him
to
feel
less
affection
for
you
she
has
told
him
that
he
is
too
young
to
understand
the
reason
but
shall
hear
it
when
he
is
older
she
wishes
that
there
should
be
no
shadow
on
your
first
the
earl
sank
back
into
his
chair
his
fierce
old
eyes
gleamed
under
his
beetling
brows
come
now
he
said
still
breathlessly
come
now
you
do
mean
the
mother
has
told
him
not
one
word
my
lord
replied
the
lawyer
coolly
that
i
can
assure
you
the
child
is
prepared
to
believe
you
the
most
amiable
and
affectionate
of
grandparents
nothing
absolutely
nothing
has
been
said
to
him
to
give
him
the
slightest
doubt
of
your
perfection
and
as
i
carried
out
your
commands
in
every
detail
while
in
new
york
he
certainly
regards
you
as
a
wonder
of
he
does
eh
said
the
earl
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
said
havisham
that
lord
fauntleroy
impressions
of
you
will
depend
entirely
upon
yourself
and
if
you
will
pardon
the
liberty
i
take
in
making
the
suggestion
i
think
you
will
succeed
better
with
him
if
you
take
the
precaution
not
to
speak
slightingly
of
his
pooh
pooh
said
the
earl
the
youngster
is
only
seven
years
old
he
has
spent
those
seven
years
at
his
mother
side
returned
havisham
and
she
has
all
his
v
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
carriage
containing
little
lord
fauntleroy
and
havisham
drove
up
the
long
avenue
which
led
to
the
castle
the
earl
had
given
orders
that
his
grandson
should
arrive
in
time
to
dine
with
him
and
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself
he
had
also
ordered
that
the
child
should
be
sent
alone
into
the
room
in
which
he
intended
to
receive
him
as
the
carriage
rolled
up
the
avenue
lord
fauntleroy
sat
leaning
comfortably
against
the
luxurious
cushions
and
regarded
the
prospect
with
great
interest
he
was
in
fact
interested
in
everything
he
saw
he
had
been
interested
in
the
carriage
with
its
large
splendid
horses
and
their
glittering
harness
he
had
been
interested
in
the
tall
coachman
and
footman
with
their
resplendent
livery
and
he
had
been
especially
interested
in
the
coronet
on
the
panels
and
had
struck
up
an
acquaintance
with
the
footman
for
the
purpose
of
inquiring
what
it
meant
when
the
carriage
reached
the
great
gates
of
the
park
he
looked
out
of
the
window
to
get
a
good
view
of
the
huge
stone
lions
ornamenting
the
entrance
the
gates
were
opened
by
a
motherly
woman
who
came
out
of
a
pretty
lodge
two
children
ran
out
of
the
door
of
the
house
and
stood
looking
with
round
eyes
at
the
little
boy
in
the
carriage
who
looked
at
them
also
their
mother
stood
courtesying
and
smiling
and
the
children
on
receiving
a
sign
from
her
made
bobbing
little
courtesies
too
does
she
know
me
asked
lord
fauntleroy
i
think
she
must
think
she
knows
and
he
took
off
his
black
velvet
cap
to
her
and
smiled
how
do
you
do
he
said
brightly
the
woman
seemed
pleased
he
thought
the
smile
broadened
on
her
rosy
face
and
a
kind
look
came
into
her
blue
eyes
god
bless
your
lordship
she
said
god
bless
your
pretty
face
good
luck
and
happiness
to
your
lordship
welcome
to
you
lord
fauntleroy
waved
his
cap
and
nodded
to
her
again
as
the
carriage
rolled
by
her
i
like
that
woman
he
said
she
looks
as
if
she
liked
boys
i
should
like
to
come
here
and
play
with
her
children
i
wonder
if
she
has
enough
to
make
up
a
company
havisham
did
not
tell
him
that
he
would
scarcely
be
allowed
to
make
playmates
of
the
children
the
lawyer
thought
there
was
time
enough
for
giving
him
that
information
the
carriage
rolled
on
and
on
between
the
great
beautiful
trees
which
grew
on
each
side
of
the
avenue
and
stretched
their
broad
swaying
branches
in
an
arch
across
it
cedric
had
never
seen
such
trees
they
were
so
grand
and
stately
and
their
branches
grew
so
low
down
on
their
huge
trunks
he
did
not
then
know
that
dorincourt
castle
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
in
all
england
that
its
park
was
one
of
the
broadest
and
finest
and
its
trees
and
avenue
almost
without
rivals
but
he
did
know
that
it
was
all
very
beautiful
he
liked
the
big
trees
with
the
late
afternoon
sunlight
striking
golden
lances
through
them
he
liked
the
perfect
stillness
which
rested
on
everything
he
felt
a
great
strange
pleasure
in
the
beauty
of
which
he
caught
glimpses
under
and
between
the
sweeping
boughs
the
great
beautiful
spaces
of
the
park
with
still
other
trees
standing
sometimes
stately
and
alone
and
sometimes
in
groups
now
and
then
they
passed
places
where
tall
ferns
grew
in
masses
and
again
and
again
the
ground
was
azure
with
the
bluebells
swaying
in
the
soft
breeze
several
times
he
started
up
with
a
laugh
of
delight
as
a
rabbit
leaped
up
from
under
the
greenery
and
scudded
away
with
a
twinkle
of
short
white
tail
behind
it
once
a
covey
of
partridges
rose
with
a
sudden
whir
and
flew
away
and
then
he
shouted
and
clapped
his
hands
it
a
beautiful
place
is
it
he
said
to
havisham
i
never
saw
such
a
beautiful
place
it
prettier
even
than
central
he
was
rather
puzzled
by
the
length
of
time
they
were
on
their
way
how
far
is
it
he
said
at
length
from
the
gate
to
the
front
door
it
is
between
three
and
four
miles
answered
the
lawyer
that
a
long
way
for
a
person
to
live
from
his
gate
remarked
his
lordship
every
few
minutes
he
saw
something
new
to
wonder
at
and
admire
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
deer
some
couched
in
the
grass
some
standing
with
their
pretty
antlered
heads
turned
with
a
air
toward
the
avenue
as
the
carriage
wheels
disturbed
them
he
was
enchanted
has
there
been
a
circus
he
cried
or
do
they
live
here
always
whose
are
they
they
live
here
havisham
told
him
they
belong
to
the
earl
your
it
was
not
long
after
this
that
they
saw
the
castle
it
rose
up
before
them
stately
and
beautiful
and
gray
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
casting
dazzling
lights
on
its
many
windows
it
had
turrets
and
battlements
and
towers
a
great
deal
of
ivy
grew
upon
its
walls
all
the
broad
open
space
about
it
was
laid
out
in
terraces
and
lawns
and
beds
of
brilliant
flowers
it
the
most
beautiful
place
i
ever
saw
said
cedric
his
round
face
flushing
with
pleasure
it
reminds
any
one
of
a
king
palace
i
saw
a
picture
of
one
once
in
a
he
saw
the
great
thrown
open
and
many
servants
standing
in
two
lines
looking
at
him
he
wondered
why
they
were
standing
there
and
admired
their
liveries
very
much
he
did
not
know
that
they
were
there
to
do
honor
to
the
little
boy
to
whom
all
this
splendor
would
one
day
belong
the
beautiful
castle
like
the
fairy
king
palace
the
magnificent
park
the
grand
old
trees
the
dells
full
of
ferns
and
bluebells
where
the
hares
and
rabbits
played
the
dappled
deer
couching
in
the
deep
grass
it
was
only
a
couple
of
weeks
since
he
had
sat
with
hobbs
among
the
potatoes
and
canned
peaches
with
his
legs
dangling
from
the
high
stool
it
would
not
have
been
possible
for
him
to
realize
that
he
had
very
much
to
do
with
all
this
grandeur
at
the
head
of
the
line
of
servants
there
stood
an
elderly
woman
in
a
rich
plain
black
silk
gown
she
had
gray
hair
and
wore
a
cap
as
he
entered
the
hall
she
stood
nearer
than
the
rest
and
the
child
thought
from
the
look
in
her
eyes
that
she
was
going
to
speak
to
him
havisham
who
held
his
hand
paused
a
moment
this
is
lord
fauntleroy
mellon
he
said
lord
fauntleroy
this
is
mellon
who
is
the
cedric
gave
her
his
hand
his
eyes
lighting
up
was
it
you
who
sent
the
cat
he
said
i
much
obliged
to
you
mellon
handsome
old
face
looked
as
pleased
as
the
face
of
the
wife
had
done
i
should
know
his
lordship
anywhere
she
said
to
havisham
he
has
the
captain
face
and
way
it
a
great
day
this
cedric
wondered
why
it
was
a
great
day
he
looked
at
mellon
curiously
it
seemed
to
him
for
a
moment
as
if
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
yet
it
was
evident
she
was
not
unhappy
she
smiled
down
on
him
the
cat
left
two
beautiful
kittens
here
she
said
they
shall
be
sent
up
to
your
lordship
havisham
said
a
few
words
to
her
in
a
low
voice
in
the
library
sir
mellon
replied
his
lordship
is
to
be
taken
there
a
few
minutes
later
the
very
tall
footman
in
livery
who
had
escorted
cedric
to
the
library
door
opened
it
and
announced
lord
fauntleroy
my
lord
in
quite
a
majestic
tone
if
he
was
only
a
footman
he
felt
it
was
rather
a
grand
occasion
when
the
heir
came
home
to
his
own
land
and
possessions
and
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
old
earl
whose
place
and
title
he
was
to
take
cedric
crossed
the
threshold
into
the
room
it
was
a
very
large
and
splendid
room
with
massive
carven
furniture
in
it
and
shelves
upon
shelves
of
books
the
furniture
was
so
dark
and
the
draperies
so
heavy
the
windows
were
so
deep
and
it
seemed
such
a
distance
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
that
since
the
sun
had
gone
down
the
effect
of
it
all
was
rather
gloomy
for
a
moment
cedric
thought
there
was
nobody
in
the
room
but
soon
he
saw
that
by
the
fire
burning
on
the
wide
hearth
there
was
a
large
and
that
in
that
chair
some
one
was
sitting
some
one
who
did
not
at
first
turn
to
look
at
him
but
he
had
attracted
attention
in
one
quarter
at
least
on
the
floor
by
the
lay
a
dog
a
huge
tawny
mastiff
with
body
and
limbs
almost
as
big
as
a
lion
and
this
great
creature
rose
majestically
and
slowly
and
marched
toward
the
little
fellow
with
a
heavy
step
then
the
person
in
the
chair
spoke
dougal
he
called
come
back
but
there
was
no
more
fear
in
little
lord
fauntleroy
heart
than
there
was
unkindness
he
had
been
a
brave
little
fellow
all
his
life
he
put
his
hand
on
the
big
dog
collar
in
the
most
natural
way
in
the
world
and
they
strayed
forward
together
dougal
sniffing
as
he
went
and
then
the
earl
looked
up
what
cedric
saw
was
a
large
old
man
with
shaggy
white
hair
and
eyebrows
and
a
nose
like
an
eagle
beak
between
his
deep
fierce
eyes
what
the
earl
saw
was
a
graceful
childish
figure
in
a
black
velvet
suit
with
a
lace
collar
and
with
waving
about
the
handsome
manly
little
face
whose
eyes
met
his
with
a
look
of
innocent
if
the
castle
was
like
the
palace
in
a
fairy
story
it
must
be
owned
that
little
lord
fauntleroy
was
himself
rather
like
a
small
copy
of
the
fairy
prince
though
he
was
not
at
all
aware
of
the
fact
and
perhaps
was
rather
a
sturdy
young
model
of
a
fairy
but
there
was
a
sudden
glow
of
triumph
and
exultation
in
the
fiery
old
earl
heart
as
he
saw
what
a
strong
beautiful
boy
this
grandson
was
and
how
unhesitatingly
he
looked
up
as
he
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
big
dog
neck
it
pleased
the
grim
old
nobleman
that
the
child
should
show
no
shyness
or
fear
either
of
the
dog
or
of
himself
cedric
looked
at
him
just
as
he
had
looked
at
the
woman
at
the
lodge
and
at
the
housekeeper
and
came
quite
close
to
him
are
you
the
earl
he
said
i
your
grandson
you
know
that
havisham
brought
i
lord
he
held
out
his
hand
because
he
thought
it
must
be
the
polite
and
proper
thing
to
do
even
with
earls
i
hope
you
are
very
well
he
continued
with
the
utmost
friendliness
i
very
glad
to
see
the
earl
shook
hands
with
him
with
a
curious
gleam
in
his
eyes
just
at
first
he
was
so
astonished
that
he
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
he
stared
at
the
picturesque
little
apparition
from
under
his
shaggy
brows
and
took
it
all
in
from
head
to
foot
glad
to
see
me
are
you
he
said
yes
answered
lord
fauntleroy
there
was
a
chair
near
him
and
he
sat
down
on
it
it
was
a
rather
tall
chair
and
his
feet
did
not
touch
the
floor
when
he
had
settled
himself
in
it
but
he
seemed
to
be
quite
comfortable
as
he
sat
there
and
regarded
his
august
relative
intently
but
modestly
i
kept
wondering
what
you
would
look
like
he
remarked
i
used
to
lie
in
my
berth
in
the
ship
and
wonder
if
you
would
be
anything
like
my
am
i
asked
the
earl
well
cedric
replied
i
was
very
young
when
he
died
and
i
may
not
remember
exactly
how
he
looked
but
i
do
think
you
are
like
you
are
disappointed
i
suppose
suggested
his
grandfather
oh
no
responded
cedric
politely
of
course
you
would
like
any
one
to
look
like
your
father
but
of
course
you
would
enjoy
the
way
your
grandfather
looked
even
if
he
was
like
your
father
you
know
how
it
is
yourself
about
admiring
your
the
earl
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
stared
he
could
not
be
said
to
know
how
it
was
about
admiring
his
relations
he
had
employed
most
of
his
noble
leisure
in
quarreling
violently
with
them
in
turning
them
out
of
his
house
and
applying
abusive
epithets
to
them
and
they
all
hated
him
cordially
any
boy
would
love
his
grandfather
continued
lord
fauntleroy
especially
one
that
had
been
as
kind
to
him
as
you
have
another
queer
gleam
came
into
the
old
nobleman
eyes
oh
he
said
i
have
been
kind
to
you
have
i
yes
answered
lord
fauntleroy
brightly
i
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
about
bridget
and
the
and
bridget
exclaimed
the
earl
dick
the
yes
explained
cedric
the
ones
you
gave
me
all
that
money
for
the
money
you
told
havisham
to
give
me
if
i
wanted
ha
ejaculated
his
lordship
that
it
is
it
the
money
you
were
to
spend
as
you
liked
what
did
you
buy
with
it
i
should
like
to
hear
something
about
he
drew
his
shaggy
eyebrows
together
and
looked
at
the
child
sharply
he
was
secretly
curious
to
know
in
what
way
the
lad
had
indulged
himself
oh
said
lord
fauntleroy
perhaps
you
did
know
about
dick
and
the
and
bridget
i
forgot
you
lived
such
a
long
way
off
from
them
they
were
particular
friends
of
mine
and
you
see
michael
had
the
fever
who
michael
asked
the
earl
michael
is
bridget
husband
and
they
were
in
great
trouble
when
a
man
is
sick
and
ca
work
and
has
twelve
children
you
know
how
it
is
and
michael
has
always
been
a
sober
man
and
bridget
used
to
come
to
our
house
and
cry
and
the
evening
havisham
was
there
she
was
in
the
kitchen
crying
because
they
had
almost
nothing
to
eat
and
could
pay
the
rent
and
i
went
in
to
see
her
and
havisham
sent
for
me
and
he
said
you
had
given
him
some
money
for
me
and
i
ran
as
fast
as
i
could
into
the
kitchen
and
gave
it
to
bridget
and
that
made
it
all
right
and
bridget
could
scarcely
believe
her
eyes
that
why
i
so
obliged
to
oh
said
the
earl
in
his
deep
voice
that
was
one
of
the
things
you
did
for
yourself
was
it
what
else
dougal
had
been
sitting
by
the
tall
chair
the
great
dog
had
taken
its
place
there
when
cedric
sat
down
several
times
it
had
turned
and
looked
up
at
the
boy
as
if
interested
in
the
conversation
dougal
was
a
solemn
dog
who
seemed
to
feel
altogether
too
big
to
take
responsibilities
lightly
the
old
earl
who
knew
the
dog
well
had
watched
it
with
secret
interest
dougal
was
not
a
dog
whose
habit
it
was
to
make
acquaintances
rashly
and
the
earl
wondered
somewhat
to
see
how
quietly
the
brute
sat
under
the
touch
of
the
childish
hand
and
just
at
this
moment
the
big
dog
gave
little
lord
fauntleroy
one
more
look
of
dignified
scrutiny
and
deliberately
laid
its
huge
head
on
the
boy
knee
the
small
hand
went
on
stroking
this
new
friend
as
cedric
answered
well
there
was
dick
he
said
you
like
dick
he
so
this
was
an
americanism
the
earl
was
not
prepared
for
what
does
that
mean
he
inquired
lord
fauntleroy
paused
a
moment
to
reflect
he
was
not
very
sure
himself
what
it
meant
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
as
meaning
something
very
creditable
because
dick
had
been
fond
of
using
it
i
think
it
means
that
he
would
cheat
any
one
he
exclaimed
or
hit
a
boy
who
was
under
his
size
and
that
he
blacks
people
boots
very
well
and
makes
them
shine
as
much
as
he
can
he
a
perfessional
and
he
one
of
your
acquaintances
is
he
said
the
earl
he
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
replied
his
grandson
not
quite
as
old
as
hobbs
but
quite
old
he
gave
me
a
present
just
before
the
ship
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
drew
forth
a
neatly
folded
red
object
and
opened
it
with
an
air
of
affectionate
pride
it
was
the
red
silk
handkerchief
with
the
large
purple
and
heads
on
it
he
gave
me
this
said
his
young
lordship
i
shall
keep
it
always
you
can
wear
it
round
your
neck
or
keep
it
in
your
pocket
he
bought
it
with
the
first
money
he
earned
after
i
bought
jake
out
and
gave
him
the
new
brushes
it
a
keepsake
i
put
some
poetry
in
hobbs
watch
it
was
this
you
see
remember
me
when
this
i
see
i
shall
always
remember
the
sensations
of
the
right
honorable
the
earl
of
dorincourt
could
scarcely
be
described
he
was
not
an
old
nobleman
who
was
very
easily
bewildered
because
he
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
but
here
was
something
he
found
so
novel
that
it
almost
took
his
lordly
breath
away
and
caused
him
some
singular
emotions
he
had
never
cared
for
children
he
had
been
so
occupied
with
his
own
pleasures
that
he
had
never
had
time
to
care
for
them
his
own
sons
had
not
interested
him
when
they
were
very
young
though
sometimes
he
remembered
having
thought
father
a
handsome
and
strong
little
fellow
he
had
been
so
selfish
himself
that
he
had
missed
the
pleasure
of
seeing
unselfishness
in
others
and
he
had
not
known
how
tender
and
faithful
and
affectionate
a
little
child
can
be
and
how
innocent
and
unconscious
are
its
simple
generous
impulses
a
boy
had
always
seemed
to
him
a
most
objectionable
little
animal
selfish
and
greedy
and
boisterous
when
not
under
strict
restraint
his
own
two
eldest
sons
had
given
their
tutors
constant
trouble
and
annoyance
and
of
the
younger
one
he
fancied
he
had
heard
few
complaints
because
the
boy
was
of
no
particular
importance
it
had
never
once
occurred
to
him
that
he
should
like
his
grandson
he
had
sent
for
the
little
cedric
because
his
pride
impelled
him
to
do
so
if
the
boy
was
to
take
his
place
in
the
future
he
did
not
wish
his
name
to
be
made
ridiculous
by
descending
to
an
uneducated
boor
he
had
been
convinced
the
boy
would
be
a
clownish
fellow
if
he
were
brought
up
in
america
he
had
no
feeling
of
affection
for
the
lad
his
only
hope
was
that
he
should
find
him
decently
and
with
a
respectable
share
of
sense
he
had
been
so
disappointed
in
his
other
sons
and
had
been
made
so
furious
by
captain
errol
american
marriage
that
he
had
never
once
thought
that
anything
creditable
could
come
of
it
when
the
footman
had
announced
lord
fauntleroy
he
had
almost
dreaded
to
look
at
the
boy
lest
he
should
find
him
all
that
he
had
feared
it
was
because
of
this
feeling
that
he
had
ordered
that
the
child
should
be
sent
to
him
alone
his
pride
could
not
endure
that
others
should
see
his
disappointment
if
he
was
to
be
disappointed
his
proud
stubborn
old
heart
therefore
had
leaped
within
him
when
the
boy
came
forward
with
his
graceful
easy
carriage
his
fearless
hand
on
the
big
dog
neck
even
in
the
moments
when
he
had
hoped
the
most
the
earl
had
never
hoped
that
his
grandson
would
look
like
that
it
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
true
that
this
should
be
the
boy
he
had
dreaded
to
see
the
child
of
the
woman
he
so
disliked
this
little
fellow
with
so
much
beauty
and
such
a
brave
childish
grace
the
earl
stern
composure
was
quite
shaken
by
this
startling
surprise
and
then
their
talk
began
and
he
was
still
more
curiously
moved
and
more
and
more
puzzled
in
the
first
place
he
was
so
used
to
seeing
people
rather
afraid
and
embarrassed
before
him
that
he
had
expected
nothing
else
but
that
his
grandson
would
be
timid
or
shy
but
cedric
was
no
more
afraid
of
the
earl
than
he
had
been
of
dougal
he
was
not
bold
he
was
only
innocently
friendly
and
he
was
not
conscious
that
there
could
be
any
reason
why
he
should
be
awkward
or
afraid
the
earl
could
not
help
seeing
that
the
little
boy
took
him
for
a
friend
and
treated
him
as
one
without
having
any
doubt
of
him
at
all
it
was
quite
plain
as
the
little
fellow
sat
there
in
his
tall
chair
and
talked
in
his
friendly
way
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
this
large
old
man
could
be
anything
but
kind
to
him
and
rather
pleased
to
see
him
there
and
it
was
plain
too
that
in
his
childish
way
he
wished
to
please
and
interest
his
grandfather
cross
and
and
worldly
as
the
old
earl
was
he
could
not
help
feeling
a
secret
and
novel
pleasure
in
this
very
confidence
after
all
it
was
not
disagreeable
to
meet
some
one
who
did
not
distrust
him
or
shrink
from
him
or
seem
to
detect
the
ugly
part
of
his
nature
some
one
who
looked
at
him
with
clear
unsuspecting
eyes
if
it
was
only
a
little
boy
in
a
black
velvet
suit
so
the
old
man
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
led
his
young
companion
on
to
telling
him
still
more
of
himself
and
with
that
odd
gleam
in
his
eyes
watched
the
little
fellow
as
he
talked
lord
fauntleroy
was
quite
willing
to
answer
all
his
questions
and
chatted
on
in
his
genial
little
way
quite
composedly
he
told
him
all
about
dick
and
jake
and
the
and
hobbs
he
described
the
republican
rally
in
all
the
glory
of
its
banners
and
transparencies
torches
and
rockets
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
he
reached
the
fourth
of
july
and
the
revolution
and
was
just
becoming
enthusiastic
when
he
suddenly
recollected
something
and
stopped
very
abruptly
what
is
the
matter
demanded
his
grandfather
why
do
you
go
on
lord
fauntleroy
moved
rather
uneasily
in
his
chair
it
was
evident
to
the
earl
that
he
was
embarrassed
by
the
thought
which
had
just
occurred
to
him
i
was
just
thinking
that
perhaps
you
might
like
it
he
replied
perhaps
some
one
belonging
to
you
might
have
been
there
i
forgot
you
were
an
you
can
go
on
said
my
lord
no
one
belonging
to
me
was
there
you
forgot
you
were
an
englishman
oh
no
said
cedric
quickly
i
an
american
you
are
an
englishman
said
the
earl
grimly
your
father
was
an
it
amused
him
a
little
to
say
this
but
it
did
not
amuse
cedric
the
lad
had
never
thought
of
such
a
development
as
this
he
felt
himself
grow
quite
hot
up
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
i
was
born
in
america
he
protested
you
have
to
be
an
american
if
you
are
born
in
america
i
beg
your
pardon
with
serious
politeness
and
delicacy
for
contradicting
you
hobbs
told
me
if
there
were
another
war
you
know
i
should
have
to
to
be
an
the
earl
gave
a
grim
half
laugh
it
was
short
and
grim
but
it
was
a
laugh
you
would
would
you
he
said
he
hated
america
and
americans
but
it
amused
him
to
see
how
serious
and
interested
this
small
patriot
was
he
thought
that
so
good
an
american
might
make
a
rather
good
englishman
when
he
was
a
man
they
had
not
time
to
go
very
deep
into
the
revolution
again
and
indeed
lord
fauntleroy
felt
some
delicacy
about
returning
to
the
subject
before
dinner
was
announced
cedric
left
his
chair
and
went
to
his
noble
kinsman
he
looked
down
at
his
gouty
foot
would
you
like
me
to
help
you
he
said
politely
you
could
lean
on
me
you
know
once
when
hobbs
hurt
his
foot
with
a
rolling
on
it
he
used
to
lean
on
the
big
footman
almost
periled
his
reputation
and
his
situation
by
smiling
he
was
an
aristocratic
footman
who
had
always
lived
in
the
best
of
noble
families
and
he
had
never
smiled
indeed
he
would
have
felt
himself
a
disgraced
and
vulgar
footman
if
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
led
by
any
circumstance
whatever
into
such
an
indiscretion
as
a
smile
but
he
had
a
very
narrow
escape
he
only
just
saved
himself
by
staring
straight
over
the
earl
head
at
a
very
ugly
picture
the
earl
looked
his
valiant
young
relative
over
from
head
to
foot
do
you
think
you
could
do
it
he
asked
gruffly
i
think
i
could
said
cedric
i
strong
i
seven
you
know
you
could
lean
on
your
stick
on
one
side
and
on
me
on
the
other
dick
says
i
a
good
deal
of
muscle
for
a
boy
that
only
he
shut
his
hand
and
moved
it
upward
to
his
shoulder
so
that
the
earl
might
see
the
muscle
dick
had
kindly
approved
of
and
his
face
was
so
grave
and
earnest
that
the
footman
found
it
necessary
to
look
very
hard
indeed
at
the
ugly
picture
well
said
the
earl
you
may
cedric
gave
him
his
stick
and
began
to
assist
him
to
rise
usually
the
footman
did
this
and
was
violently
sworn
at
when
his
lordship
had
an
extra
twinge
of
gout
the
earl
was
not
a
very
polite
person
as
a
rule
and
many
a
time
the
huge
footmen
about
him
quaked
inside
their
imposing
liveries
but
this
evening
he
did
not
swear
though
his
gouty
foot
gave
him
more
twinges
than
one
he
chose
to
try
an
experiment
he
got
up
slowly
and
put
his
hand
on
the
small
shoulder
presented
to
him
with
so
much
courage
little
lord
fauntleroy
made
a
careful
step
forward
looking
down
at
the
gouty
foot
just
lean
on
me
he
said
with
encouraging
good
cheer
i
walk
very
if
the
earl
had
been
supported
by
the
footman
he
would
have
rested
less
on
his
stick
and
more
on
his
assistant
arm
and
yet
it
was
part
of
his
experiment
to
let
his
grandson
feel
his
burden
as
no
light
weight
it
was
quite
a
heavy
weight
indeed
and
after
a
few
steps
his
young
lordship
face
grew
quite
hot
and
his
heart
beat
rather
fast
but
he
braced
himself
sturdily
remembering
his
muscle
and
dick
approval
of
it
do
be
afraid
of
leaning
on
me
he
panted
i
all
right
if
if
it
is
a
very
long
it
was
not
really
very
far
to
the
but
it
seemed
rather
a
long
way
to
cedric
before
they
reached
the
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
the
hand
on
his
shoulder
seemed
to
grow
heavier
at
every
step
and
his
face
grew
redder
and
hotter
and
his
breath
shorter
but
he
never
thought
of
giving
up
he
stiffened
his
childish
muscles
held
his
head
erect
and
encouraged
the
earl
as
he
limped
along
does
your
foot
hurt
you
very
much
when
you
stand
on
it
he
asked
did
you
ever
put
it
in
hot
water
and
mustard
hobbs
used
to
put
his
in
hot
water
arnica
is
a
very
nice
thing
they
tell
the
big
dog
stalked
slowly
beside
them
and
the
big
footman
followed
several
times
he
looked
very
queer
as
he
watched
the
little
figure
making
the
very
most
of
all
its
strength
and
bearing
its
burden
with
such
the
earl
too
looked
rather
queer
once
as
he
glanced
sidewise
down
at
the
flushed
little
face
when
they
entered
the
room
where
they
were
to
dine
cedric
saw
it
was
a
very
large
and
imposing
one
and
that
the
footman
who
stood
behind
the
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
stared
very
hard
as
they
came
in
but
they
reached
the
chair
at
last
the
hand
was
removed
from
his
shoulder
and
the
earl
was
fairly
seated
cedric
took
out
dick
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
forehead
it
a
warm
night
is
it
he
said
perhaps
you
need
a
fire
because
because
of
your
foot
but
it
seems
just
a
little
warm
to
his
delicate
consideration
for
his
noble
relative
feelings
was
such
that
he
did
not
wish
to
seem
to
intimate
that
any
of
his
surroundings
were
unnecessary
you
have
been
doing
some
rather
hard
work
said
the
earl
oh
no
said
lord
fauntleroy
it
was
exactly
hard
but
i
got
a
little
warm
a
person
will
get
warm
in
summer
and
he
rubbed
his
damp
curls
rather
vigorously
with
the
gorgeous
handkerchief
his
own
chair
was
placed
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
opposite
his
grandfather
it
was
a
chair
with
arms
and
intended
for
a
much
larger
individual
than
himself
indeed
everything
he
had
seen
so
far
the
great
rooms
with
their
high
ceilings
the
massive
furniture
the
big
footman
the
big
dog
the
earl
himself
were
all
of
proportions
calculated
to
make
this
little
lad
feel
that
he
was
very
small
indeed
but
that
did
not
trouble
him
he
had
never
thought
himself
very
large
or
important
and
he
was
quite
willing
to
accommodate
himself
even
to
circumstances
which
rather
overpowered
him
perhaps
he
had
never
looked
so
little
a
fellow
as
when
seated
now
in
his
great
chair
at
the
end
of
the
table
notwithstanding
his
solitary
existence
the
earl
chose
to
live
in
some
state
he
was
fond
of
his
dinner
and
he
dined
in
a
formal
style
cedric
looked
at
him
across
a
glitter
of
splendid
glass
and
plate
which
to
his
unaccustomed
eyes
seemed
quite
dazzling
a
stranger
looking
on
might
well
have
smiled
at
the
picture
the
great
stately
room
the
big
liveried
servants
the
bright
lights
the
glittering
silver
and
glass
the
old
nobleman
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
the
very
small
boy
at
the
foot
dinner
was
usually
a
very
serious
matter
with
the
earl
and
it
was
a
very
serious
matter
with
the
cook
if
his
lordship
was
not
pleased
or
had
an
indifferent
appetite
however
his
appetite
seemed
a
trifle
better
than
usual
perhaps
because
he
had
something
to
think
of
beside
the
flavor
of
the
entrees
and
the
management
of
the
gravies
his
grandson
gave
him
something
to
think
of
he
kept
looking
at
him
across
the
table
he
did
not
say
very
much
himself
but
he
managed
to
make
the
boy
talk
he
had
never
imagined
that
he
could
be
entertained
by
hearing
a
child
talk
but
lord
fauntleroy
at
once
puzzled
and
amused
him
and
he
kept
remembering
how
he
had
let
the
childish
shoulder
feel
his
weight
just
for
the
sake
of
trying
how
far
the
boy
courage
and
endurance
would
go
and
it
pleased
him
to
know
that
his
grandson
had
not
quailed
and
had
not
seemed
to
think
even
for
a
moment
of
giving
up
what
he
had
undertaken
to
do
you
do
wear
your
coronet
all
the
time
remarked
lord
fauntleroy
respectfully
no
replied
the
earl
with
his
grim
smile
it
is
not
becoming
to
mr
hobbs
said
you
always
wore
it
said
cedric
but
after
he
thought
it
over
he
said
he
supposed
you
must
sometimes
take
it
off
to
put
your
hat
yes
said
the
earl
i
take
it
off
and
one
of
the
footmen
suddenly
turned
aside
and
gave
a
singular
little
cough
behind
his
hand
cedric
finished
his
dinner
first
and
then
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
took
a
survey
of
the
room
you
must
be
very
proud
of
your
house
he
said
it
such
a
beautiful
house
i
never
saw
anything
so
beautiful
but
of
course
as
i
only
seven
i
have
seen
and
you
think
i
must
be
proud
of
it
do
you
said
the
earl
i
should
think
any
one
would
be
proud
of
it
replied
lord
fauntleroy
i
should
be
proud
of
it
if
it
were
my
house
everything
about
it
is
beautiful
and
the
park
and
those
trees
how
beautiful
they
are
and
how
the
leaves
rustle
then
he
paused
an
instant
and
looked
across
the
table
rather
wistfully
it
a
very
big
house
for
just
two
people
to
live
in
is
it
he
said
it
is
quite
large
enough
for
two
answered
the
earl
do
you
find
it
too
large
his
little
lordship
hesitated
a
moment
i
was
only
thinking
he
said
that
if
two
people
lived
in
it
who
were
not
very
good
companions
they
might
feel
lonely
do
you
think
i
shall
make
a
good
companion
inquired
the
earl
yes
replied
cedric
i
think
you
will
hobbs
and
i
were
great
friends
he
was
the
best
friend
i
had
except
the
earl
made
a
quick
movement
of
his
bushy
eyebrows
who
is
dearest
she
is
my
mother
said
lord
fauntleroy
in
a
rather
low
quiet
little
voice
perhaps
he
was
a
trifle
tired
as
his
was
nearing
and
perhaps
after
the
excitement
of
the
last
few
days
it
was
natural
he
should
be
tired
so
perhaps
too
the
feeling
of
weariness
brought
to
him
a
vague
sense
of
loneliness
in
the
remembrance
that
he
was
not
to
sleep
at
home
watched
over
by
the
loving
eyes
of
that
best
friend
of
his
they
had
always
been
best
friends
this
boy
and
his
young
mother
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
her
and
the
more
he
thought
of
her
the
less
was
he
inclined
to
talk
and
by
the
time
the
dinner
was
at
an
end
the
earl
saw
that
there
was
a
faint
shadow
on
his
face
but
cedric
bore
himself
with
excellent
courage
and
when
they
went
back
to
the
library
though
the
tall
footman
walked
on
one
side
of
his
master
the
hand
rested
on
his
grandson
shoulder
though
not
so
heavily
as
before
when
the
footman
left
them
alone
cedric
sat
down
upon
the
near
dougal
for
a
few
minutes
he
stroked
the
dog
ears
in
silence
and
looked
at
the
fire
the
earl
watched
him
the
boy
eyes
looked
wistful
and
thoughtful
and
once
or
twice
he
gave
a
little
sigh
the
earl
sat
still
and
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
grandson
fauntleroy
he
said
at
last
what
are
you
thinking
of
fauntleroy
looked
up
with
a
manful
effort
at
a
smile
i
was
thinking
about
dearest
he
said
and
and
i
think
i
better
get
up
and
walk
up
and
down
the
he
rose
up
and
put
his
hands
in
his
small
pockets
and
began
to
walk
to
and
fro
his
eyes
were
very
bright
and
his
lips
were
pressed
together
but
he
kept
his
head
up
and
walked
firmly
dougal
moved
lazily
and
looked
at
him
and
then
stood
up
he
walked
over
to
the
child
and
began
to
follow
him
uneasily
fauntleroy
drew
one
hand
from
his
pocket
and
laid
it
on
the
dog
head
he
a
very
nice
dog
he
said
he
my
friend
he
knows
how
i
how
do
you
feel
asked
the
earl
it
disturbed
him
to
see
the
struggle
the
little
fellow
was
having
with
his
first
feeling
of
homesickness
but
it
pleased
him
to
see
that
he
was
making
so
brave
an
effort
to
bear
it
well
he
liked
this
childish
courage
come
here
he
said
fauntleroy
went
to
him
i
never
was
away
from
my
own
house
before
said
the
boy
with
a
troubled
look
in
his
brown
eyes
it
makes
a
person
feel
a
strange
feeling
when
he
has
to
stay
all
night
in
another
person
castle
instead
of
in
his
own
house
but
dearest
is
not
very
far
away
from
me
she
told
me
to
remember
that
and
and
i
seven
and
i
can
look
at
the
picture
she
gave
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
brought
out
a
small
violet
case
this
is
it
he
said
you
see
you
press
this
spring
and
it
opens
and
she
is
in
there
he
had
come
close
to
the
earl
chair
and
as
he
drew
forth
the
little
case
he
leaned
against
the
arm
of
it
and
against
the
old
man
arm
too
as
confidingly
as
if
children
had
always
leaned
there
there
she
is
he
said
as
the
case
opened
and
he
looked
up
with
a
smile
the
earl
knitted
his
brows
he
did
not
wish
to
see
the
picture
but
he
looked
at
it
in
spite
of
himself
and
there
looked
up
at
him
from
it
such
a
pretty
young
face
a
face
so
like
the
child
at
his
side
that
it
quite
startled
him
i
suppose
you
think
you
are
very
fond
of
her
he
said
yes
answered
lord
fauntleroy
in
a
gentle
tone
and
with
simple
directness
i
do
think
so
and
i
think
it
true
you
see
hobbs
was
my
friend
and
dick
and
bridget
and
mary
and
michael
they
were
my
friends
too
but
dearest
well
she
is
my
close
friend
and
we
always
tell
each
other
everything
my
father
left
her
to
me
to
take
care
of
and
when
i
am
a
man
i
am
going
to
work
and
earn
money
for
what
do
you
think
of
doing
inquired
his
grandfather
his
young
lordship
slipped
down
upon
the
and
sat
there
with
the
picture
still
in
his
hand
he
seemed
to
be
reflecting
seriously
before
he
answered
i
did
think
perhaps
i
might
go
into
business
with
hobbs
he
said
but
i
should
like
to
be
a
we
send
you
to
the
house
of
lords
instead
said
his
grandfather
well
remarked
lord
fauntleroy
if
i
could
be
a
president
and
if
that
is
a
good
business
i
should
mind
the
grocery
business
is
dull
perhaps
he
was
weighing
the
matter
in
his
mind
for
he
sat
very
quiet
after
this
and
looked
at
the
fire
for
some
time
the
earl
did
not
speak
again
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
watched
him
a
great
many
strange
new
thoughts
passed
through
the
old
mind
dougal
had
stretched
himself
out
and
gone
to
sleep
with
his
head
on
his
huge
paws
there
was
a
long
silence
in
about
half
an
hour
time
havisham
was
ushered
in
the
great
room
was
very
still
when
he
entered
the
earl
was
still
leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
moved
as
havisham
approached
and
held
up
his
hand
in
a
gesture
of
warning
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
scarcely
intended
to
make
the
gesture
as
if
it
were
almost
involuntary
dougal
was
still
asleep
and
close
beside
the
great
dog
sleeping
also
with
his
curly
head
upon
his
arm
lay
little
lord
fauntleroy
vi
when
lord
fauntleroy
wakened
in
the
morning
he
had
not
wakened
at
all
when
he
had
been
carried
to
bed
the
night
before
the
first
sounds
he
was
conscious
of
were
the
crackling
of
a
wood
fire
and
the
murmur
of
voices
you
will
be
careful
dawson
not
to
say
anything
about
it
he
heard
some
one
say
he
does
not
know
why
she
is
not
to
be
with
him
and
the
reason
is
to
be
kept
from
if
them
his
lordship
orders
mem
another
voice
answered
have
to
be
kep
i
suppose
but
if
you
excuse
the
liberty
mem
as
it
between
ourselves
servant
or
no
servant
all
i
have
to
say
is
it
a
cruel
thing
parting
that
poor
pretty
young
widdered
from
her
own
flesh
and
blood
and
him
such
a
little
beauty
and
a
nobleman
born
james
and
thomas
mem
last
night
in
the
servants
hall
they
both
of
say
as
they
never
see
anythink
in
their
two
lives
nor
yet
no
other
gentleman
in
livery
like
that
little
fellow
ways
as
innercent
an
polite
an
interested
as
if
he
been
sitting
there
dining
with
his
best
friend
and
the
temper
of
a
angel
instead
of
one
if
you
excuse
me
mem
as
it
well
known
is
enough
to
curdle
your
blood
in
your
veins
at
times
and
as
to
looks
mem
when
we
was
rung
for
james
and
me
to
go
into
the
library
and
bring
him
upstairs
and
james
lifted
him
up
in
his
arms
what
with
his
little
innercent
face
all
red
and
rosy
and
his
little
head
on
james
shoulder
and
his
hair
hanging
down
all
curly
an
shinin
a
prettier
takiner
sight
never
wish
to
see
an
it
my
opinion
my
lord
was
blind
to
it
neither
for
he
looked
at
him
and
he
says
to
james
you
do
wake
him
he
cedric
moved
on
his
pillow
and
turned
over
opening
his
eyes
there
were
two
women
in
the
room
everything
was
bright
and
cheerful
with
chintz
there
was
a
fire
on
the
hearth
and
the
sunshine
was
streaming
in
through
the
windows
both
women
came
toward
him
and
he
saw
that
one
of
them
was
mellon
the
housekeeper
and
the
other
a
comfortable
woman
with
a
face
as
kind
and
as
a
face
could
be
my
lord
said
mellon
did
you
sleep
well
his
lordship
rubbed
his
eyes
and
smiled
he
said
i
did
know
i
was
you
were
carried
upstairs
when
you
were
asleep
said
the
housekeeper
this
is
your
bedroom
and
this
is
dawson
who
is
to
take
care
of
fauntleroy
sat
up
in
bed
and
held
out
his
hand
to
dawson
as
he
had
held
it
out
to
the
earl
how
do
you
do
he
said
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
coming
to
take
care
of
you
can
call
her
dawson
my
lord
said
the
housekeeper
with
a
smile
she
is
used
to
being
called
miss
dawson
or
dawson
inquired
his
lordship
just
dawson
my
lord
said
dawson
herself
beaming
all
over
neither
miss
nor
missis
bless
your
little
heart
will
you
get
up
now
and
let
dawson
dress
you
and
then
have
your
breakfast
in
the
nursery
i
learned
to
dress
myself
many
years
ago
thank
you
answered
fauntleroy
dearest
taught
me
is
my
mamma
we
had
only
mary
to
do
all
the
work
washing
and
all
and
so
of
course
it
would
do
to
give
her
so
much
trouble
i
can
take
my
bath
too
pretty
well
if
you
just
be
kind
enough
to
the
corners
after
i
dawson
and
the
housekeeper
exchanged
glances
dawson
will
do
anything
you
ask
her
to
said
mellon
that
i
will
bless
him
said
dawson
in
her
comforting
voice
he
shall
dress
himself
if
he
likes
and
i
stand
by
ready
to
help
him
if
he
wants
thank
you
responded
lord
fauntleroy
it
a
little
hard
sometimes
about
the
buttons
you
know
and
then
i
have
to
ask
he
thought
dawson
a
very
kind
woman
and
before
the
bath
and
the
dressing
were
finished
they
were
excellent
friends
and
he
had
found
out
a
great
deal
about
her
he
had
discovered
that
her
husband
had
been
a
soldier
and
had
been
killed
in
a
real
battle
and
that
her
son
was
a
sailor
and
was
away
on
a
long
cruise
and
that
he
had
seen
pirates
and
cannibals
and
chinese
people
and
turks
and
that
he
brought
home
strange
shells
and
pieces
of
coral
which
dawson
was
ready
to
show
at
any
moment
some
of
them
being
in
her
trunk
all
this
was
very
interesting
he
also
found
out
that
she
had
taken
care
of
little
children
all
her
life
and
that
she
had
just
come
from
a
great
house
in
another
part
of
england
where
she
had
been
taking
care
of
a
beautiful
little
girl
whose
name
was
lady
gwyneth
vaughn
and
she
is
a
sort
of
relation
of
your
lordship
said
dawson
and
perhaps
sometime
you
may
see
do
you
think
i
shall
said
fauntleroy
i
should
like
that
i
never
knew
any
little
girls
but
i
always
like
to
look
at
when
he
went
into
the
adjoining
room
to
take
his
breakfast
and
saw
what
a
great
room
it
was
and
found
there
was
another
adjoining
it
which
dawson
told
him
was
his
also
the
feeling
that
he
was
very
small
indeed
came
over
him
again
so
strongly
that
he
confided
it
to
dawson
as
he
sat
down
to
the
table
on
which
the
pretty
breakfast
service
was
arranged
i
am
a
very
little
boy
he
said
rather
wistfully
to
live
in
such
a
large
castle
and
have
so
many
big
rooms
do
you
think
so
oh
come
said
dawson
you
feel
just
a
little
strange
at
first
that
all
but
you
get
over
that
very
soon
and
then
you
like
it
here
it
such
a
beautiful
place
you
it
a
very
beautiful
place
of
course
said
fauntleroy
with
a
little
sigh
but
i
should
like
it
better
if
i
did
miss
dearest
so
i
always
had
my
breakfast
with
her
in
the
morning
and
put
the
sugar
and
cream
in
her
tea
for
her
and
handed
her
the
toast
that
made
it
very
sociable
of
oh
well
answered
dawson
comfortingly
you
know
you
can
see
her
every
day
and
there
no
knowing
how
much
you
have
to
tell
her
bless
you
wait
till
you
walked
about
a
bit
and
seen
things
the
dogs
and
the
stables
with
all
the
horses
in
them
there
one
of
them
i
know
you
like
to
see
is
there
exclaimed
fauntleroy
i
very
fond
of
horses
i
was
very
fond
of
jim
he
was
the
horse
that
belonged
to
hobbs
grocery
wagon
he
was
a
beautiful
horse
when
he
was
well
said
dawson
you
just
wait
till
you
seen
what
in
the
stables
and
deary
me
you
have
looked
even
into
the
very
next
room
yet
what
is
there
asked
fauntleroy
wait
until
you
had
your
breakfast
and
then
you
shall
see
said
dawson
at
this
he
naturally
began
to
grow
curious
and
he
applied
himself
assiduously
to
his
breakfast
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
must
be
something
worth
looking
at
in
the
next
room
dawson
had
such
a
consequential
mysterious
air
now
then
he
said
slipping
off
his
seat
a
few
minutes
later
had
enough
can
i
go
and
look
at
it
dawson
nodded
and
led
the
way
looking
more
mysterious
and
important
than
ever
he
began
to
be
very
much
interested
indeed
when
she
opened
the
door
of
the
room
he
stood
upon
the
threshold
and
looked
about
him
in
amazement
he
did
not
speak
he
only
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
stood
there
flushing
up
to
his
forehead
and
looking
in
he
flushed
up
because
he
was
so
surprised
and
for
the
moment
excited
to
see
such
a
place
was
enough
to
surprise
any
ordinary
boy
the
room
was
a
large
one
too
as
all
the
rooms
seemed
to
be
and
it
appeared
to
him
more
beautiful
than
the
rest
only
in
a
different
way
the
furniture
was
not
so
massive
and
antique
as
was
that
in
the
rooms
he
had
seen
downstairs
the
draperies
and
rugs
and
walls
were
brighter
there
were
shelves
full
of
books
and
on
the
tables
were
numbers
of
toys
beautiful
ingenious
things
such
as
he
had
looked
at
with
wonder
and
delight
through
the
shop
windows
in
new
york
it
looks
like
a
boy
room
he
said
at
last
catching
his
breath
a
little
whom
do
they
belong
to
go
and
look
at
them
said
dawson
they
belong
to
you
to
me
he
cried
to
me
why
do
they
belong
to
me
who
gave
them
to
me
and
he
sprang
forward
with
a
gay
little
shout
it
seemed
almost
too
much
to
be
believed
it
was
grandpapa
he
said
with
his
eyes
as
bright
as
stars
i
know
it
was
grandpapa
yes
it
was
his
lordship
said
dawson
and
if
you
will
be
a
nice
little
gentleman
and
not
fret
about
things
and
will
enjoy
yourself
and
be
happy
all
the
day
he
will
give
you
anything
you
ask
it
was
a
tremendously
exciting
morning
there
were
so
many
things
to
be
examined
so
many
experiments
to
be
tried
each
novelty
was
so
absorbing
that
he
could
scarcely
turn
from
it
to
look
at
the
next
and
it
was
so
curious
to
know
that
all
this
had
been
prepared
for
himself
alone
that
even
before
he
had
left
new
york
people
had
come
down
from
london
to
arrange
the
rooms
he
was
to
occupy
and
had
provided
the
books
and
playthings
most
likely
to
interest
him
did
you
ever
know
any
one
he
said
to
dawson
who
had
such
a
kind
grandfather
dawson
face
wore
an
uncertain
expression
for
a
moment
she
had
not
a
very
high
opinion
of
his
lordship
the
earl
she
had
not
been
in
the
house
many
days
but
she
had
been
there
long
enough
to
hear
the
old
nobleman
peculiarities
discussed
very
freely
in
the
servants
hall
an
of
all
the
wicious
savage
hold
fellows
it
was
ever
my
to
wear
livery
hunder
the
tallest
footman
had
said
the
wiolentest
and
wust
by
a
long
and
this
particular
footman
whose
name
was
thomas
had
also
repeated
to
his
companions
below
stairs
some
of
the
earl
remarks
to
havisham
when
they
had
been
discussing
these
very
preparations
give
him
his
own
way
and
fill
his
rooms
with
toys
my
lord
had
said
give
him
what
will
amuse
him
and
he
forget
about
his
mother
quickly
enough
amuse
him
and
fill
his
mind
with
other
things
and
we
shall
have
no
trouble
that
boy
so
perhaps
having
had
this
truly
amiable
object
in
view
it
did
not
please
him
so
very
much
to
find
it
did
not
seem
to
be
exactly
this
particular
boy
nature
the
earl
had
passed
a
bad
night
and
had
spent
the
morning
in
his
room
but
at
noon
after
he
had
lunched
he
sent
for
his
grandson
fauntleroy
answered
the
summons
at
once
he
came
down
the
broad
staircase
with
a
bounding
step
the
earl
heard
him
run
across
the
hall
and
then
the
door
opened
and
he
came
in
with
red
cheeks
and
sparkling
eyes
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
send
for
me
he
said
i
was
ready
a
long
time
ago
i
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
all
those
things
i
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
i
have
been
playing
with
them
all
the
oh
said
the
earl
you
like
them
do
you
i
like
them
so
much
well
i
could
tell
you
how
much
said
fauntleroy
his
face
glowing
with
delight
there
one
that
like
baseball
only
you
play
it
on
a
board
with
black
and
white
pegs
and
you
keep
your
score
with
some
counters
on
a
wire
i
tried
to
teach
dawson
but
she
could
quite
understand
it
just
at
first
you
see
she
never
played
baseball
being
a
lady
and
i
afraid
i
was
very
good
at
explaining
it
to
her
but
you
know
all
about
it
do
you
i
afraid
i
do
replied
the
earl
it
an
american
game
it
is
it
something
like
cricket
i
never
saw
cricket
said
fauntleroy
but
hobbs
took
me
several
times
to
see
baseball
it
a
splendid
game
you
get
so
excited
would
you
like
me
to
go
and
get
my
game
and
show
it
to
you
perhaps
it
would
amuse
you
and
make
you
forget
about
your
foot
does
your
foot
hurt
you
very
much
this
morning
more
than
i
enjoy
was
the
answer
then
perhaps
you
could
forget
it
said
the
little
fellow
anxiously
perhaps
it
would
bother
you
to
be
told
about
the
game
do
you
think
it
would
amuse
you
or
do
you
think
it
would
bother
you
go
and
get
it
said
the
earl
it
certainly
was
a
novel
entertainment
this
making
a
companion
of
a
child
who
offered
to
teach
him
to
play
games
but
the
very
novelty
of
it
amused
him
there
was
a
smile
lurking
about
the
earl
mouth
when
cedric
came
back
with
the
box
containing
the
game
in
his
arms
and
an
expression
of
the
most
eager
interest
on
his
face
may
i
pull
that
little
table
over
here
to
your
chair
he
asked
ring
for
thomas
said
the
earl
he
will
place
it
for
oh
i
can
do
it
myself
answered
fauntleroy
it
not
very
very
well
replied
his
grandfather
the
lurking
smile
deepened
on
the
old
man
face
as
he
watched
the
little
fellow
preparations
there
was
such
an
absorbed
interest
in
them
the
small
table
was
dragged
forward
and
placed
by
his
chair
and
the
game
taken
from
its
box
and
arranged
upon
it
it
very
interesting
when
you
once
begin
said
fauntleroy
you
see
the
black
pegs
can
be
your
side
and
the
white
ones
mine
they
men
you
know
and
once
round
the
field
is
a
home
run
and
counts
one
and
these
are
the
outs
and
here
is
the
first
base
and
that
the
second
and
that
the
third
and
that
the
home
he
entered
into
the
details
of
explanation
with
the
greatest
animation
he
showed
all
the
attitudes
of
pitcher
and
catcher
and
batter
in
the
real
game
and
gave
a
dramatic
description
of
a
wonderful
hot
ball
he
had
seen
caught
on
the
glorious
occasion
on
which
he
had
witnessed
a
match
in
company
with
hobbs
his
vigorous
graceful
little
body
his
eager
gestures
his
simple
enjoyment
of
it
all
were
pleasant
to
behold
when
at
last
the
explanations
and
illustrations
were
at
an
end
and
the
game
began
in
good
earnest
the
earl
still
found
himself
entertained
his
young
companion
was
wholly
absorbed
he
played
with
all
his
childish
heart
his
gay
little
laughs
when
he
made
a
good
throw
his
enthusiasm
over
a
home
run
his
impartial
delight
over
his
own
good
luck
and
his
opponent
would
have
given
a
flavor
to
any
game
if
a
week
before
any
one
had
told
the
earl
of
dorincourt
that
on
that
particular
morning
he
would
be
forgetting
his
gout
and
his
bad
temper
in
a
child
game
played
with
black
and
white
wooden
pegs
on
a
gayly
painted
board
with
a
small
boy
for
a
companion
he
would
without
doubt
have
made
himself
very
unpleasant
and
yet
he
certainly
had
forgotten
himself
when
the
door
opened
and
thomas
announced
a
visitor
the
visitor
in
question
who
was
an
elderly
gentleman
in
black
and
no
less
a
person
than
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
was
so
startled
by
the
amazing
scene
which
met
his
eye
that
he
almost
fell
back
a
pace
and
ran
some
risk
of
colliding
with
thomas
there
was
in
fact
no
part
of
his
duty
that
the
reverend
mordaunt
found
so
decidedly
unpleasant
as
that
part
which
compelled
him
to
call
upon
his
noble
patron
at
the
castle
his
noble
patron
indeed
usually
made
these
visits
as
disagreeable
as
it
lay
in
his
lordly
power
to
make
them
he
abhorred
churches
and
charities
and
flew
into
violent
rages
when
any
of
his
tenantry
took
the
liberty
of
being
poor
and
ill
and
needing
assistance
when
his
gout
was
at
its
worst
he
did
not
hesitate
to
announce
that
he
would
not
be
bored
and
irritated
by
being
told
stories
of
their
miserable
misfortunes
when
his
gout
troubled
him
less
and
he
was
in
a
somewhat
more
humane
frame
of
mind
he
would
perhaps
give
the
rector
some
money
after
having
bullied
him
in
the
most
painful
manner
and
berated
the
whole
parish
for
its
shiftlessness
and
imbecility
but
whatsoever
his
mood
he
never
failed
to
make
as
many
sarcastic
and
embarrassing
speeches
as
possible
and
to
cause
the
reverend
mordaunt
to
wish
it
were
proper
and
to
throw
something
heavy
at
him
during
all
the
years
in
which
mordaunt
had
been
in
charge
of
dorincourt
parish
the
rector
certainly
did
not
remember
having
seen
his
lordship
of
his
own
free
will
do
any
one
a
kindness
or
under
any
circumstances
whatever
show
that
he
thought
of
any
one
but
himself
he
had
called
to
speak
to
him
of
a
specially
pressing
case
and
as
he
had
walked
up
the
avenue
he
had
for
two
reasons
dreaded
his
visit
more
than
usual
in
the
first
place
he
knew
that
his
lordship
had
for
several
days
been
suffering
with
the
gout
and
had
been
in
so
villainous
a
humor
that
rumors
of
it
had
even
reached
the
village
carried
there
by
one
of
the
young
women
servants
to
her
sister
who
kept
a
little
shop
and
retailed
and
cotton
and
peppermints
and
gossip
as
a
means
of
earning
an
honest
living
what
dibble
did
not
know
about
the
castle
and
its
inmates
and
the
and
their
inmates
and
the
village
and
its
population
was
really
not
worth
being
talked
about
and
of
course
she
knew
everything
about
the
castle
because
her
sister
jane
shorts
was
one
of
the
upper
housemaids
and
was
very
friendly
and
intimate
with
thomas
and
the
way
his
lordship
do
go
on
said
dibble
over
the
counter
and
the
way
he
do
use
language
thomas
told
jane
herself
no
flesh
and
blood
as
is
in
livery
could
stand
for
throw
a
plate
of
toast
at
thomas
hisself
he
did
not
more
than
two
days
since
and
if
it
for
other
things
being
agreeable
and
the
society
below
stairs
most
genteel
warning
would
have
been
gave
within
a
hour
and
the
rector
had
heard
all
this
for
somehow
the
earl
was
a
favorite
black
sheep
in
the
cottages
and
and
his
bad
behavior
gave
many
a
good
woman
something
to
talk
about
when
she
had
company
to
tea
and
the
second
reason
was
even
worse
because
it
was
a
new
one
and
had
been
talked
about
with
the
most
excited
interest
who
did
not
know
of
the
old
nobleman
fury
when
his
handsome
son
the
captain
had
married
the
american
lady
who
did
not
know
how
cruelly
he
had
treated
the
captain
and
how
the
big
gay
young
man
who
was
the
only
member
of
the
grand
family
any
one
liked
had
died
in
a
foreign
land
poor
and
unforgiven
who
did
not
know
how
fiercely
his
lordship
had
hated
the
poor
young
creature
who
had
been
this
son
wife
and
how
he
had
hated
the
thought
of
her
child
and
never
meant
to
see
the
boy
until
his
two
sons
died
and
left
him
without
an
heir
and
then
who
did
not
know
that
he
had
looked
forward
without
any
affection
or
pleasure
to
his
grandson
coming
and
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
should
find
the
boy
a
vulgar
awkward
pert
american
lad
more
likely
to
disgrace
his
noble
name
than
to
honor
it
the
proud
angry
old
man
thought
he
had
kept
all
his
thoughts
secret
he
did
not
suppose
any
one
had
dared
to
guess
at
much
less
talk
over
what
he
felt
and
dreaded
but
his
servants
watched
him
and
read
his
face
and
his
and
fits
of
gloom
and
discussed
them
in
the
servants
hall
and
while
he
thought
himself
quite
secure
from
the
common
herd
thomas
was
telling
jane
and
the
cook
and
the
butler
and
the
housemaids
and
the
other
footmen
that
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
hold
man
was
wuss
than
usual
hover
the
capting
boy
hanticipatin
as
he
wo
be
no
credit
to
the
fambly
an
serve
him
right
added
thomas
hit
hown
fault
wot
can
he
iggspect
from
a
child
brought
up
in
pore
circumstances
in
that
there
low
hamerica
and
as
the
reverend
mordaunt
walked
under
the
great
trees
he
remembered
that
this
questionable
little
boy
had
arrived
at
the
castle
only
the
evening
before
and
that
there
were
nine
chances
to
one
that
his
lordship
worst
fears
were
realized
and
chances
to
one
that
if
the
poor
little
fellow
had
disappointed
him
the
earl
was
even
now
in
a
tearing
rage
and
ready
to
vent
all
his
rancor
on
the
first
person
who
called
which
it
appeared
probable
would
be
his
reverend
self
judge
then
of
his
amazement
when
as
thomas
opened
the
library
door
his
ears
were
greeted
by
a
delighted
ring
of
childish
laughter
that
two
out
shouted
an
excited
clear
little
voice
you
see
two
out
and
there
was
the
earl
chair
and
the
and
his
foot
on
it
and
by
him
a
small
table
and
a
game
on
it
and
quite
close
to
him
actually
leaning
against
his
arm
and
his
ungouty
knee
was
a
little
boy
with
face
glowing
and
eyes
dancing
with
excitement
it
two
out
the
little
stranger
cried
you
had
any
luck
that
time
had
you
and
then
they
both
recognized
at
once
that
some
one
had
come
in
the
earl
glanced
around
knitting
his
shaggy
eyebrows
as
he
had
a
trick
of
doing
and
when
he
saw
who
it
was
mordaunt
was
still
more
surprised
to
see
that
he
looked
even
less
disagreeable
than
usual
instead
of
more
so
in
fact
he
looked
almost
as
if
he
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
how
disagreeable
he
was
and
how
unpleasant
he
really
could
make
himself
when
he
tried
ah
he
said
in
his
harsh
voice
but
giving
his
hand
rather
graciously
mordaunt
i
found
a
new
employment
you
he
put
his
other
hand
on
cedric
shoulder
perhaps
deep
down
in
his
heart
there
was
a
stir
of
gratified
pride
that
it
was
such
an
heir
he
had
to
present
there
was
a
spark
of
something
like
pleasure
in
his
eyes
as
he
moved
the
boy
slightly
forward
this
is
the
new
lord
fauntleroy
he
said
fauntleroy
this
is
mordaunt
the
rector
of
the
fauntleroy
looked
up
at
the
gentleman
in
the
clerical
garments
and
gave
him
his
hand
i
am
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
sir
he
said
remembering
the
words
he
had
heard
hobbs
use
on
one
or
two
occasions
when
he
had
been
greeting
a
new
customer
with
ceremony
cedric
felt
quite
sure
that
one
ought
to
be
more
than
usually
polite
to
a
minister
mordaunt
held
the
small
hand
in
his
a
moment
as
he
looked
down
at
the
child
face
smiling
involuntarily
he
liked
the
little
fellow
from
that
instant
as
in
fact
people
always
did
like
him
and
it
was
not
the
boy
beauty
and
grace
which
most
appealed
to
him
it
was
the
simple
natural
kindliness
in
the
little
lad
which
made
any
words
he
uttered
however
quaint
and
unexpected
sound
pleasant
and
sincere
as
the
rector
looked
at
cedric
he
forgot
to
think
of
the
earl
at
all
nothing
in
the
world
is
so
strong
as
a
kind
heart
and
somehow
this
kind
little
heart
though
it
was
only
the
heart
of
a
child
seemed
to
clear
all
the
atmosphere
of
the
big
gloomy
room
and
make
it
brighter
i
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
lord
fauntleroy
said
the
rector
you
made
a
long
journey
to
come
to
us
a
great
many
people
will
be
glad
to
know
you
made
it
it
was
a
long
way
answered
fauntleroy
but
dearest
my
mother
was
with
me
and
i
was
lonely
of
course
you
are
never
lonely
if
your
mother
is
with
you
and
the
ship
was
take
a
chair
mordaunt
said
the
earl
mordaunt
sat
down
he
glanced
from
fauntleroy
to
the
earl
your
lordship
is
greatly
to
be
congratulated
he
said
warmly
but
the
earl
plainly
had
no
intention
of
showing
his
feelings
on
the
subject
he
is
like
his
father
he
said
rather
gruffly
let
us
hope
conduct
himself
more
and
then
he
added
well
what
is
it
this
morning
mordaunt
who
is
in
trouble
now
this
was
not
as
bad
as
mordaunt
had
expected
but
he
hesitated
a
second
before
he
began
it
is
higgins
he
said
higgins
of
edge
farm
he
has
been
very
unfortunate
he
was
ill
himself
last
autumn
and
his
children
had
scarlet
fever
i
ca
say
that
he
is
a
very
good
manager
but
he
has
had
and
of
course
he
is
behindhand
in
many
ways
he
is
in
trouble
about
his
rent
now
newick
tells
him
if
he
does
pay
it
he
must
leave
the
place
and
of
course
that
would
be
a
very
serious
matter
his
wife
is
ill
and
he
came
to
me
yesterday
to
beg
me
to
see
about
it
and
ask
you
for
time
he
thinks
if
you
would
give
him
time
he
could
catch
up
they
all
think
that
said
the
earl
looking
rather
black
fauntleroy
made
a
movement
forward
he
had
been
standing
between
his
grandfather
and
the
visitor
listening
with
all
his
might
he
had
begun
to
be
interested
in
higgins
at
once
he
wondered
how
many
children
there
were
and
if
the
scarlet
fever
had
hurt
them
very
much
his
eyes
were
wide
open
and
were
fixed
upon
mordaunt
with
intent
interest
as
that
gentleman
went
on
with
the
conversation
higgins
is
a
man
said
the
rector
making
an
effort
to
strengthen
his
plea
he
is
a
bad
enough
tenant
replied
his
lordship
and
he
is
always
behindhand
newick
tells
he
is
in
great
trouble
now
said
the
rector
he
is
very
fond
of
his
wife
and
children
and
if
the
farm
is
taken
from
him
they
may
literally
starve
he
can
not
give
them
the
nourishing
things
they
need
two
of
the
children
were
left
very
low
after
the
fever
and
the
doctor
orders
for
them
wine
and
luxuries
that
higgins
can
not
at
this
fauntleroy
moved
a
step
nearer
that
was
the
way
with
michael
he
said
the
earl
slightly
started
i
forgot
you
he
said
i
forgot
we
had
a
philanthropist
in
the
room
who
was
michael
and
the
gleam
of
queer
amusement
came
back
into
the
old
man
eyes
he
was
bridget
husband
who
had
the
fever
answered
fauntleroy
and
he
could
pay
the
rent
or
buy
wine
and
things
and
you
gave
me
that
money
to
help
the
earl
drew
his
brows
together
into
a
curious
frown
which
somehow
was
scarcely
grim
at
all
he
glanced
across
at
mordaunt
i
do
know
what
sort
of
landed
proprietor
he
will
make
he
said
i
told
havisham
the
boy
was
to
have
what
he
wanted
anything
he
wanted
and
what
he
wanted
it
seems
was
money
to
give
to
oh
but
they
were
beggars
said
fauntleroy
eagerly
michael
was
a
splendid
bricklayer
they
all
oh
said
the
earl
they
were
not
beggars
they
were
splendid
bricklayers
and
bootblacks
and
he
bent
his
gaze
on
the
boy
for
a
few
seconds
in
silence
the
fact
was
that
a
new
thought
was
coming
to
him
and
though
perhaps
it
was
not
prompted
by
the
noblest
emotions
it
was
not
a
bad
thought
come
here
he
said
at
last
fauntleroy
went
and
stood
as
near
to
him
as
possible
without
encroaching
on
the
gouty
foot
what
would
you
do
in
this
case
his
lordship
asked
it
must
be
confessed
that
mordaunt
experienced
for
the
moment
a
curious
sensation
being
a
man
of
great
thoughtfulness
and
having
spent
so
many
years
on
the
estate
of
dorincourt
knowing
the
tenantry
rich
and
poor
the
people
of
the
village
honest
and
industrious
dishonest
and
lazy
he
realized
very
strongly
what
power
for
good
or
evil
would
be
given
in
the
future
to
this
one
small
boy
standing
there
his
brown
eyes
wide
open
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
and
the
thought
came
to
him
also
that
a
great
deal
of
power
might
perhaps
through
the
caprice
of
a
proud
old
man
be
given
to
him
now
and
that
if
his
young
nature
were
not
a
simple
and
generous
one
it
might
be
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
not
only
for
others
but
for
himself
and
what
would
you
do
in
such
a
case
demanded
the
earl
fauntleroy
drew
a
little
nearer
and
laid
one
hand
on
his
knee
with
the
most
confiding
air
of
good
comradeship
if
i
were
very
rich
he
said
and
not
only
just
a
little
boy
i
should
let
him
stay
and
give
him
the
things
for
his
children
but
then
i
am
only
a
then
after
a
second
pause
in
which
his
face
brightened
visibly
you
can
do
anything
ca
you
he
said
humph
said
my
lord
staring
at
him
that
your
opinion
is
it
and
he
was
not
displeased
either
i
mean
you
can
give
any
one
anything
said
fauntleroy
who
newick
he
is
my
agent
answered
the
earl
and
some
of
my
tenants
are
not
of
are
you
going
to
write
him
a
letter
now
inquired
fauntleroy
shall
i
bring
you
the
pen
and
ink
i
can
take
the
game
off
this
it
plainly
had
not
for
an
instant
occurred
to
him
that
newick
would
be
allowed
to
do
his
worst
the
earl
paused
a
moment
still
looking
at
him
can
you
write
he
asked
yes
answered
cedric
but
not
very
move
the
things
from
the
table
commanded
my
lord
and
bring
the
pen
and
ink
and
a
sheet
of
paper
from
my
mordaunt
interest
began
to
increase
fauntleroy
did
as
he
was
told
very
deftly
in
a
few
moments
the
sheet
of
paper
the
big
inkstand
and
the
pen
were
ready
there
he
said
gayly
now
you
can
write
you
are
to
write
it
said
the
earl
i
exclaimed
fauntleroy
and
a
flush
overspread
his
forehead
will
it
do
if
i
write
it
i
do
always
spell
quite
right
when
i
have
a
dictionary
and
nobody
tells
it
will
do
answered
the
earl
higgins
will
not
complain
of
the
spelling
i
not
the
philanthropist
you
are
dip
your
pen
in
the
fauntleroy
took
up
the
pen
and
dipped
it
in
the
then
he
arranged
himself
in
position
leaning
on
the
table
now
he
inquired
what
must
i
say
you
may
say
is
not
to
be
interfered
with
for
the
present
and
sign
it
said
the
earl
fauntleroy
dipped
his
pen
in
the
ink
again
and
resting
his
arm
began
to
write
it
was
rather
a
slow
and
serious
process
but
he
gave
his
whole
soul
to
it
after
a
while
however
the
manuscript
was
complete
and
he
handed
it
to
his
grandfather
with
a
smile
slightly
tinged
with
anxiety
do
you
think
it
will
do
he
asked
the
earl
looked
at
it
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
twitched
a
little
yes
he
answered
higgins
will
find
it
entirely
and
he
handed
it
to
mordaunt
what
mordaunt
found
written
was
this
dear
newik
if
you
pleas
higins
is
not
to
be
intur
feared
with
for
the
present
and
oblige
yours
rispecferly
mr
hobbs
always
signed
his
letters
that
way
said
fauntleroy
and
i
thought
i
better
say
is
that
exactly
the
right
way
to
spell
it
not
exactly
the
way
it
is
spelled
in
the
dictionary
answered
the
earl
i
was
afraid
of
that
said
fauntleroy
i
ought
to
have
asked
you
see
that
the
way
with
words
of
more
than
one
syllable
you
have
to
look
in
the
dictionary
it
always
safest
i
write
it
over
and
write
it
over
again
he
did
making
quite
an
imposing
copy
and
taking
precautions
in
the
matter
of
spelling
by
consulting
the
earl
himself
spelling
is
a
curious
thing
he
said
it
so
often
different
from
what
you
expect
it
to
be
i
used
to
think
was
spelled
but
it
is
you
know
and
you
think
was
spelled
if
you
did
inquire
sometimes
it
almost
discourages
when
mordaunt
went
away
he
took
the
letter
with
him
and
he
took
something
else
with
him
also
namely
a
pleasanter
feeling
and
a
more
hopeful
one
than
he
had
ever
carried
home
with
him
down
that
avenue
on
any
previous
visit
he
had
made
at
dorincourt
castle
when
he
was
gone
fauntleroy
who
had
accompanied
him
to
the
door
went
back
to
his
grandfather
may
i
go
to
dearest
now
he
asked
i
think
she
will
be
waiting
for
the
earl
was
silent
a
moment
there
is
something
in
the
stable
for
you
to
see
first
he
said
ring
the
if
you
please
said
fauntleroy
with
his
quick
little
flush
i
very
much
obliged
but
i
think
i
better
see
it
she
will
be
expecting
me
all
the
very
well
answered
the
earl
we
will
order
the
then
he
added
dryly
it
a
fauntleroy
drew
a
long
breath
a
pony
he
exclaimed
whose
pony
is
it
yours
replied
the
earl
mine
cried
the
little
fellow
mine
like
the
things
upstairs
yes
said
his
grandfather
would
you
like
to
see
it
shall
i
order
it
to
be
brought
around
fauntleroy
cheeks
grew
redder
and
redder
i
never
thought
i
should
have
a
pony
he
said
i
never
thought
that
how
glad
dearest
will
be
you
give
me
everything
do
you
do
you
wish
to
see
it
inquired
the
earl
fauntleroy
drew
a
long
breath
i
want
to
see
it
he
said
i
want
to
see
it
so
much
i
can
hardly
wait
but
i
afraid
there
is
you
must
go
and
see
your
mother
this
afternoon
asked
the
earl
you
think
you
ca
put
it
off
why
said
fauntleroy
she
has
been
thinking
about
me
all
the
morning
and
i
have
been
thinking
about
her
oh
said
the
earl
you
have
have
you
ring
the
as
they
drove
down
the
avenue
under
the
arching
trees
he
was
rather
silent
but
fauntleroy
was
not
he
talked
about
the
pony
what
color
was
it
how
big
was
it
what
was
its
name
what
did
it
like
to
eat
best
how
old
was
it
how
early
in
the
morning
might
he
get
up
and
see
it
dearest
will
be
so
glad
he
kept
saying
she
will
be
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
being
so
kind
to
me
she
knows
i
always
liked
ponies
so
much
but
we
never
thought
i
should
have
one
there
was
a
little
boy
on
fifth
avenue
who
had
one
and
he
used
to
ride
out
every
morning
and
we
used
to
take
a
walk
past
his
house
to
see
he
leaned
back
against
the
cushions
and
regarded
the
earl
with
rapt
interest
for
a
few
minutes
and
in
entire
silence
i
think
you
must
be
the
best
person
in
the
world
he
burst
forth
at
last
you
are
always
doing
good
are
you
and
thinking
about
other
people
dearest
says
that
is
the
best
kind
of
goodness
not
to
think
about
yourself
but
to
think
about
other
people
that
is
just
the
way
you
are
is
it
his
lordship
was
so
dumfounded
to
find
himself
presented
in
such
agreeable
colors
that
he
did
not
know
exactly
what
to
say
he
felt
that
he
needed
time
for
reflection
to
see
each
of
his
ugly
selfish
motives
changed
into
a
good
and
generous
one
by
the
simplicity
of
a
child
was
a
singular
experience
fauntleroy
went
on
still
regarding
him
with
admiring
eyes
those
great
clear
innocent
eyes
you
make
so
many
people
happy
he
said
there
michael
and
bridget
and
their
ten
children
and
the
and
dick
and
hobbs
and
higgins
and
higgins
and
their
children
and
mordaunt
because
of
course
he
was
glad
and
dearest
and
me
about
the
pony
and
all
the
other
things
do
you
know
i
counted
it
up
on
my
fingers
and
in
my
mind
and
it
people
you
been
kind
to
that
a
good
many
and
i
was
the
person
who
was
kind
to
them
was
i
said
the
earl
why
yes
you
know
answered
fauntleroy
you
made
them
all
happy
do
you
know
with
some
delicate
hesitation
that
people
are
sometimes
mistaken
about
earls
when
they
do
know
them
hobbs
was
i
am
going
to
write
him
and
tell
him
about
what
was
hobbs
opinion
of
earls
asked
his
lordship
well
you
see
the
difficulty
was
replied
his
young
companion
that
he
did
know
any
and
he
only
read
about
them
in
books
he
thought
you
must
mind
it
that
they
were
gory
tyrants
and
he
said
he
would
have
them
hanging
around
his
store
but
if
he
known
you
i
sure
he
would
have
felt
quite
different
i
shall
tell
him
about
what
shall
you
tell
him
i
shall
tell
him
said
fauntleroy
glowing
with
enthusiasm
that
you
are
the
kindest
man
i
ever
heard
of
and
you
are
always
thinking
of
other
people
and
making
them
happy
and
and
i
hope
when
i
grow
up
i
shall
be
just
like
just
like
me
repeated
his
lordship
looking
at
the
little
kindling
face
and
a
dull
red
crept
up
under
his
withered
skin
and
he
suddenly
turned
his
eyes
away
and
looked
out
of
the
carriage
window
at
the
great
with
the
sun
shining
on
their
glossy
leaves
just
like
you
said
fauntleroy
adding
modestly
if
i
can
perhaps
i
not
good
enough
but
i
going
to
the
carriage
rolled
on
down
the
stately
avenue
under
the
beautiful
trees
through
the
spaces
of
green
shade
and
lanes
of
golden
sunlight
fauntleroy
saw
again
the
lovely
places
where
the
ferns
grew
high
and
the
bluebells
swayed
in
the
breeze
he
saw
the
deer
standing
or
lying
in
the
deep
grass
turn
their
large
startled
eyes
as
the
carriage
passed
and
caught
glimpses
of
the
brown
rabbits
as
they
scurried
away
he
heard
the
whir
of
the
partridges
and
the
calls
and
songs
of
the
birds
and
it
all
seemed
even
more
beautiful
to
him
than
before
all
his
heart
was
filled
with
pleasure
and
happiness
in
the
beauty
that
was
on
every
side
but
the
old
earl
saw
and
heard
very
different
things
though
he
was
apparently
looking
out
too
he
saw
a
long
life
in
which
there
had
been
neither
generous
deeds
nor
kind
thoughts
he
saw
years
in
which
a
man
who
had
been
young
and
strong
and
rich
and
powerful
had
used
his
youth
and
strength
and
wealth
and
power
only
to
please
himself
and
kill
time
as
the
days
and
years
succeeded
each
other
he
saw
this
man
when
the
time
had
been
killed
and
old
age
had
come
solitary
and
without
real
friends
in
the
midst
of
all
his
splendid
wealth
he
saw
people
who
disliked
or
feared
him
and
people
who
would
flatter
and
cringe
to
him
but
no
one
who
really
cared
whether
he
lived
or
died
unless
they
had
something
to
gain
or
lose
by
it
he
looked
out
on
the
broad
acres
which
belonged
to
him
and
he
knew
what
fauntleroy
did
not
how
far
they
extended
what
wealth
they
represented
and
how
many
people
had
homes
on
their
soil
and
he
knew
too
another
thing
fauntleroy
did
not
that
in
all
those
homes
humble
or
there
was
probably
not
one
person
however
much
he
envied
the
wealth
and
stately
name
and
power
and
however
willing
he
would
have
been
to
possess
them
who
would
for
an
instant
have
thought
of
calling
the
noble
owner
good
or
wishing
as
this
little
boy
had
to
be
like
him
and
it
was
not
exactly
pleasant
to
reflect
upon
even
for
a
cynical
worldly
old
man
who
had
been
sufficient
unto
himself
for
seventy
years
and
who
had
never
deigned
to
care
what
opinion
the
world
held
of
him
so
long
as
it
did
not
interfere
with
his
comfort
or
entertainment
and
the
fact
was
indeed
that
he
had
never
before
condescended
to
reflect
upon
it
at
all
and
he
only
did
so
now
because
a
child
had
believed
him
better
than
he
was
and
by
wishing
to
follow
in
his
illustrious
footsteps
and
imitate
his
example
had
suggested
to
him
the
curious
question
whether
he
was
exactly
the
person
to
take
as
a
model
fauntleroy
thought
the
earl
foot
must
be
hurting
him
his
brows
knitted
themselves
together
so
as
he
looked
out
at
the
park
and
thinking
this
the
considerate
little
fellow
tried
not
to
disturb
him
and
enjoyed
the
trees
and
the
ferns
and
the
deer
in
silence
but
at
last
the
carriage
having
passed
the
gates
and
bowled
through
the
green
lanes
for
a
short
distance
stopped
they
had
reached
court
lodge
and
fauntleroy
was
out
upon
the
ground
almost
before
the
big
footman
had
time
to
open
the
carriage
door
the
earl
wakened
from
his
reverie
with
a
start
what
he
said
are
we
here
yes
said
fauntleroy
let
me
give
you
your
stick
just
lean
on
me
when
you
get
i
am
not
going
to
get
out
replied
his
lordship
brusquely
not
not
to
see
dearest
exclaimed
fauntleroy
with
astonished
face
will
excuse
me
said
the
earl
dryly
go
to
her
and
tell
her
that
not
even
a
new
pony
would
keep
you
she
will
be
disappointed
said
fauntleroy
she
will
want
to
see
you
very
i
am
afraid
not
was
the
answer
the
carriage
will
call
for
you
as
we
come
tell
jeffries
to
drive
on
thomas
closed
the
carriage
door
and
after
a
puzzled
look
fauntleroy
ran
up
the
drive
the
earl
had
the
opportunity
as
havisham
once
had
of
seeing
a
pair
of
handsome
strong
little
legs
flash
over
the
ground
with
astonishing
rapidity
evidently
their
owner
had
no
intention
of
losing
any
time
the
carriage
rolled
slowly
away
but
his
lordship
did
not
at
once
lean
back
he
still
looked
out
through
a
space
in
the
trees
he
could
see
the
house
door
it
was
wide
open
the
little
figure
dashed
up
the
steps
another
figure
a
little
figure
too
slender
and
young
in
its
black
gown
ran
to
meet
it
it
seemed
as
if
they
flew
together
as
fauntleroy
leaped
into
his
mother
arms
hanging
about
her
neck
and
covering
her
sweet
young
face
with
kisses
vii
on
the
following
sunday
morning
mordaunt
had
a
large
congregation
indeed
he
could
scarcely
remember
any
sunday
on
which
the
church
had
been
so
crowded
people
appeared
upon
the
scene
who
seldom
did
him
the
honor
of
coming
to
hear
his
sermons
there
were
even
people
from
hazelton
which
was
the
next
parish
there
were
hearty
sunburned
farmers
stout
comfortable
wives
in
their
best
bonnets
and
most
gorgeous
shawls
and
half
a
dozen
children
or
so
to
each
family
the
doctor
wife
was
there
with
her
four
daughters
kimsey
and
kimsey
who
kept
the
shop
and
made
pills
and
did
up
powders
for
everybody
within
ten
miles
sat
in
their
pew
dibble
in
hers
miss
smiff
the
village
dressmaker
and
her
friend
miss
perkins
the
milliner
sat
in
theirs
the
doctor
young
man
was
present
and
the
druggist
apprentice
in
fact
almost
every
family
on
the
county
side
was
represented
in
one
way
or
another
in
the
course
of
the
preceding
week
many
wonderful
stories
had
been
told
of
little
lord
fauntleroy
dibble
had
been
kept
so
busy
attending
to
customers
who
came
in
to
buy
a
pennyworth
of
needles
or
a
of
tape
and
to
hear
what
she
had
to
relate
that
the
little
shop
bell
over
the
door
had
nearly
tinkled
itself
to
death
over
the
coming
and
going
dibble
knew
exactly
how
his
small
rooms
had
been
furnished
for
him
what
expensive
toys
had
been
bought
how
there
was
a
beautiful
brown
pony
awaiting
him
and
a
small
groom
to
attend
it
and
a
little
with
harness
and
she
could
tell
too
what
all
the
servants
had
said
when
they
had
caught
glimpses
of
the
child
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
and
how
every
female
below
stairs
had
said
it
was
a
shame
so
it
was
to
part
the
poor
pretty
dear
from
his
mother
and
had
all
declared
their
hearts
came
into
their
mouths
when
he
went
alone
into
the
library
to
see
his
grandfather
for
there
was
no
knowing
how
he
be
treated
and
his
lordship
temper
was
enough
to
fluster
them
with
old
heads
on
their
shoulders
let
alone
a
but
if
you
believe
me
jennifer
mum
dibble
had
said
fear
that
child
does
not
know
so
thomas
hisself
says
an
set
smile
he
did
an
talked
to
his
lordship
as
if
they
been
friends
ever
since
his
first
hour
an
the
earl
so
took
aback
thomas
says
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
listen
and
stare
from
under
his
eyebrows
it
thomas
opinion
bates
mum
that
bad
as
he
is
he
was
pleased
in
his
secret
soul
an
proud
too
for
a
handsomer
little
fellow
or
with
better
manners
though
so
thomas
says
he
never
wish
to
and
then
there
had
come
the
story
of
higgins
the
reverend
mordaunt
had
told
it
at
his
own
dinner
table
and
the
servants
who
had
heard
it
had
told
it
in
the
kitchen
and
from
there
it
had
spread
like
wildfire
and
on
when
higgins
had
appeared
in
town
he
had
been
questioned
on
every
side
and
newick
had
been
questioned
too
and
in
response
had
shown
to
two
or
three
people
the
note
signed
and
so
the
farmers
wives
had
found
plenty
to
talk
of
over
their
tea
and
their
shopping
and
they
had
done
the
subject
full
justice
and
made
the
most
of
it
and
on
sunday
they
had
either
walked
to
church
or
had
been
driven
in
their
gigs
by
their
husbands
who
were
perhaps
a
trifle
curious
themselves
about
the
new
little
lord
who
was
to
be
in
time
the
owner
of
the
soil
it
was
by
no
means
the
earl
habit
to
attend
church
but
he
chose
to
appear
on
this
first
sunday
it
was
his
whim
to
present
himself
in
the
huge
family
pew
with
fauntleroy
at
his
side
there
were
many
loiterers
in
the
churchyard
and
many
lingerers
in
the
lane
that
morning
there
were
groups
at
the
gates
and
in
the
porch
and
there
had
been
much
discussion
as
to
whether
my
lord
would
really
appear
or
not
when
this
discussion
was
at
its
height
one
good
woman
suddenly
uttered
an
exclamation
eh
she
said
that
must
be
the
mother
pretty
young
all
who
heard
turned
and
looked
at
the
slender
figure
in
black
coming
up
the
path
the
veil
was
thrown
back
from
her
face
and
they
could
see
how
fair
and
sweet
it
was
and
how
the
bright
hair
curled
as
softly
as
a
under
the
little
widow
cap
she
was
not
thinking
of
the
people
about
she
was
thinking
of
cedric
and
of
his
visits
to
her
and
his
joy
over
his
new
pony
on
which
he
had
actually
ridden
to
her
door
the
day
before
sitting
very
straight
and
looking
very
proud
and
happy
but
soon
she
could
not
help
being
attracted
by
the
fact
that
she
was
being
looked
at
and
that
her
arrival
had
created
some
sort
of
sensation
she
first
noticed
it
because
an
old
woman
in
a
red
cloak
made
a
bobbing
courtesy
to
her
and
then
another
did
the
same
thing
and
said
god
bless
you
my
lady
and
one
man
after
another
took
off
his
hat
as
she
passed
for
a
moment
she
did
not
understand
and
then
she
realized
that
it
was
because
she
was
little
lord
fauntleroy
mother
that
they
did
so
and
she
flushed
rather
shyly
and
smiled
and
bowed
too
and
said
thank
you
in
a
gentle
voice
to
the
old
woman
who
had
blessed
her
to
a
person
who
had
always
lived
in
a
bustling
crowded
american
city
this
simple
deference
was
very
novel
and
at
first
just
a
little
embarrassing
but
after
all
she
could
not
help
liking
and
being
touched
by
the
friendly
of
which
it
seemed
to
speak
she
had
scarcely
passed
through
the
stone
porch
into
the
church
before
the
great
event
of
the
day
happened
the
carriage
from
the
castle
with
its
handsome
horses
and
tall
liveried
servants
bowled
around
the
corner
and
down
the
green
lane
here
they
come
went
from
one
to
another
and
then
the
carriage
drew
up
and
thomas
stepped
down
and
opened
the
door
and
a
little
boy
dressed
in
black
velvet
and
with
a
splendid
mop
of
bright
waving
hair
jumped
out
every
man
woman
and
child
looked
curiously
upon
him
he
the
captain
over
again
said
those
of
the
who
remembered
his
father
he
the
captain
self
to
the
life
he
stood
there
in
the
sunlight
looking
up
at
the
earl
as
thomas
helped
that
nobleman
out
with
the
most
affectionate
interest
that
could
be
imagined
the
instant
he
could
help
he
put
out
his
hand
and
offered
his
shoulder
as
if
he
had
been
seven
feet
high
it
was
plain
enough
to
every
one
that
however
it
might
be
with
other
people
the
earl
of
dorincourt
struck
no
terror
into
the
breast
of
his
grandson
just
lean
on
me
they
heard
him
say
how
glad
the
people
are
to
see
you
and
how
well
they
all
seem
to
know
you
take
off
your
cap
fauntleroy
said
the
earl
they
are
bowing
to
to
me
cried
fauntleroy
whipping
off
his
cap
in
a
moment
baring
his
bright
head
to
the
crowd
and
turning
shining
puzzled
eyes
on
them
as
he
tried
to
bow
to
every
one
at
once
god
bless
your
lordship
said
the
courtesying
old
woman
who
had
spoken
to
his
mother
long
life
to
you
thank
you
said
fauntleroy
and
then
they
went
into
the
church
and
were
looked
at
there
on
their
way
up
the
aisle
to
the
square
and
curtained
pew
when
fauntleroy
was
fairly
seated
he
made
two
discoveries
which
pleased
him
the
first
that
across
the
church
where
he
could
look
at
her
his
mother
sat
and
smiled
at
him
the
second
that
at
one
end
of
the
pew
against
the
wall
knelt
two
quaint
figures
carven
in
stone
facing
each
other
as
they
kneeled
on
either
side
of
a
pillar
supporting
two
stone
missals
their
pointed
hands
folded
as
if
in
prayer
their
dress
very
antique
and
strange
on
the
tablet
by
them
was
written
something
of
which
he
could
only
read
the
curious
words
here
lyeth
ye
bodye
of
gregorye
arthure
fyrst
earle
of
dorincourt
allsoe
of
alisone
hildegarde
hys
may
i
whisper
inquired
his
lordship
devoured
by
curiosity
what
is
it
said
his
grandfather
who
are
they
some
of
your
ancestors
answered
the
earl
who
lived
a
few
hundred
years
perhaps
said
lord
fauntleroy
regarding
them
with
respect
perhaps
i
got
my
spelling
from
and
then
he
proceeded
to
find
his
place
in
the
church
service
when
the
music
began
he
stood
up
and
looked
across
at
his
mother
smiling
he
was
very
fond
of
music
and
his
mother
and
he
often
sang
together
so
he
joined
in
with
the
rest
his
pure
sweet
high
voice
rising
as
clear
as
the
song
of
a
bird
he
quite
forgot
himself
in
his
pleasure
in
it
the
earl
forgot
himself
a
little
too
as
he
sat
in
his
corner
of
the
pew
and
watched
the
boy
cedric
stood
with
the
big
psalter
open
in
his
hands
singing
with
all
his
childish
might
his
face
a
little
uplifted
happily
and
as
he
sang
a
long
ray
of
sunshine
crept
in
and
slanting
through
a
golden
pane
of
a
stained
glass
window
brightened
the
falling
hair
about
his
young
head
his
mother
as
she
looked
at
him
across
the
church
felt
a
thrill
pass
through
her
heart
and
a
prayer
rose
in
it
too
a
prayer
that
the
pure
simple
happiness
of
his
childish
soul
might
last
and
that
the
strange
great
fortune
which
had
fallen
to
him
might
bring
no
wrong
or
evil
with
it
there
were
many
soft
anxious
thoughts
in
her
tender
heart
in
those
new
days
oh
ceddie
she
had
said
to
him
the
evening
before
as
she
hung
over
him
in
saying
before
he
went
away
oh
ceddie
dear
i
wish
for
your
sake
i
was
very
clever
and
could
say
a
great
many
wise
things
but
only
be
good
dear
only
be
brave
only
be
kind
and
true
always
and
then
you
will
never
hurt
any
one
so
long
as
you
live
and
you
may
help
many
and
the
big
world
may
be
better
because
my
little
child
was
born
and
that
is
best
of
all
ceddie
it
is
better
than
everything
else
that
the
world
should
be
a
little
better
because
a
man
has
lived
even
ever
so
little
better
and
on
his
return
to
the
castle
fauntleroy
had
repeated
her
words
to
his
grandfather
and
i
thought
about
you
when
she
said
that
he
ended
and
i
told
her
that
was
the
way
the
world
was
because
you
had
lived
and
i
was
going
to
try
if
i
could
be
like
and
what
did
she
say
to
that
asked
his
lordship
a
trifle
uneasily
she
said
that
was
right
and
we
must
always
look
for
good
in
people
and
try
to
be
like
perhaps
it
was
this
the
old
man
remembered
as
he
glanced
through
the
divided
folds
of
the
red
curtain
of
his
pew
many
times
he
looked
over
the
people
heads
to
where
his
son
wife
sat
alone
and
he
saw
the
fair
face
the
unforgiven
dead
had
loved
and
the
eyes
which
were
so
like
those
of
the
child
at
his
side
but
what
his
thoughts
were
and
whether
they
were
hard
and
bitter
or
softened
a
little
it
would
have
been
hard
to
discover
as
they
came
out
of
church
many
of
those
who
had
attended
the
service
stood
waiting
to
see
them
pass
as
they
neared
the
gate
a
man
who
stood
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
made
a
step
forward
and
then
hesitated
he
was
a
farmer
with
a
careworn
face
well
higgins
said
the
earl
fauntleroy
turned
quickly
to
look
at
him
oh
he
exclaimed
is
it
higgins
yes
answered
the
earl
dryly
and
i
suppose
he
came
to
take
a
look
at
his
new
yes
my
lord
said
the
man
his
sunburned
face
reddening
mr
newick
told
me
his
young
lordship
was
kind
enough
to
speak
for
me
and
i
thought
i
like
to
say
a
word
of
thanks
if
i
might
be
perhaps
he
felt
some
wonder
when
he
saw
what
a
little
fellow
it
was
who
had
innocently
done
so
much
for
him
and
who
stood
there
looking
up
just
as
one
of
his
own
less
fortunate
children
might
have
done
apparently
not
realizing
his
own
importance
in
the
least
i
a
great
deal
to
thank
your
lordship
for
he
said
a
great
deal
i
oh
said
fauntleroy
i
only
wrote
the
letter
it
was
my
grandfather
who
did
it
but
you
know
how
he
is
about
always
being
good
to
everybody
is
higgins
well
now
higgins
looked
a
trifle
taken
aback
he
also
was
somewhat
startled
at
hearing
his
noble
landlord
presented
in
the
character
of
a
benevolent
being
full
of
engaging
qualities
i
well
yes
your
lordship
he
stammered
the
missus
is
better
since
the
trouble
was
took
off
her
mind
it
was
worrying
broke
her
i
glad
of
that
said
fauntleroy
my
grandfather
was
very
sorry
about
your
children
having
the
scarlet
fever
and
so
was
i
he
has
had
children
himself
i
his
son
little
boy
you
higgins
was
on
the
verge
of
being
he
felt
it
would
be
the
safer
and
more
discreet
plan
not
to
look
at
the
earl
as
it
had
been
well
known
that
his
fatherly
affection
for
his
sons
had
been
such
that
he
had
seen
them
about
twice
a
year
and
that
when
they
had
been
ill
he
had
promptly
departed
for
london
because
he
would
not
be
bored
with
doctors
and
nurses
it
was
a
little
trying
therefore
to
his
nerves
to
be
told
while
he
looked
on
his
eyes
gleaming
from
under
his
shaggy
eyebrows
that
he
felt
an
interest
in
scarlet
fever
you
see
higgins
broke
in
the
earl
with
a
fine
grim
smile
you
people
have
been
mistaken
in
me
lord
fauntleroy
understands
me
when
you
want
reliable
information
on
the
subject
of
my
character
apply
to
him
get
into
the
carriage
and
fauntleroy
jumped
in
and
the
carriage
rolled
away
down
the
green
lane
and
even
when
it
turned
the
corner
into
the
high
road
the
earl
was
still
grimly
smiling
viii
lord
dorincourt
had
occasion
to
wear
his
grim
smile
many
a
time
as
the
days
passed
by
indeed
as
his
acquaintance
with
his
grandson
progressed
he
wore
the
smile
so
often
that
there
were
moments
when
it
almost
lost
its
grimness
there
is
no
denying
that
before
lord
fauntleroy
had
appeared
on
the
scene
the
old
man
had
been
growing
very
tired
of
his
loneliness
and
his
gout
and
his
seventy
years
after
so
long
a
life
of
excitement
and
amusement
it
was
not
agreeable
to
sit
alone
even
in
the
most
splendid
room
with
one
foot
on
a
and
with
no
other
diversion
than
flying
into
a
rage
and
shouting
at
a
frightened
footman
who
hated
the
sight
of
him
the
old
earl
was
too
clever
a
man
not
to
know
perfectly
well
that
his
servants
detested
him
and
that
even
if
he
had
visitors
they
did
not
come
for
love
of
him
though
some
found
a
sort
of
amusement
in
his
sharp
sarcastic
talk
which
spared
no
one
so
long
as
he
had
been
strong
and
well
he
had
gone
from
one
place
to
another
pretending
to
amuse
himself
though
he
had
not
really
enjoyed
it
and
when
his
health
began
to
fail
he
felt
tired
of
everything
and
shut
himself
up
at
dorincourt
with
his
gout
and
his
newspapers
and
his
books
but
he
could
not
read
all
the
time
and
he
became
more
and
more
bored
as
he
called
it
he
hated
the
long
nights
and
days
and
he
grew
more
and
more
savage
and
irritable
and
then
fauntleroy
came
and
when
the
earl
saw
him
fortunately
for
the
little
fellow
the
secret
pride
of
the
grandfather
was
gratified
at
the
outset
if
cedric
had
been
a
less
handsome
little
fellow
the
old
man
might
have
taken
so
strong
a
dislike
to
him
that
he
would
not
have
given
himself
the
chance
to
see
his
grandson
finer
qualities
but
he
chose
to
think
that
cedric
beauty
and
fearless
spirit
were
the
results
of
the
dorincourt
blood
and
a
credit
to
the
dorincourt
rank
and
then
when
he
heard
the
lad
talk
and
saw
what
a
little
fellow
he
was
notwithstanding
his
boyish
ignorance
of
all
that
his
new
position
meant
the
old
earl
liked
his
grandson
more
and
actually
began
to
find
himself
rather
entertained
it
had
amused
him
to
give
into
those
childish
hands
the
power
to
bestow
a
benefit
on
poor
higgins
my
lord
cared
nothing
for
poor
higgins
but
it
pleased
him
a
little
to
think
that
his
grandson
would
be
talked
about
by
the
country
people
and
would
begin
to
be
popular
with
the
tenantry
even
in
his
childhood
then
it
had
gratified
him
to
drive
to
church
with
cedric
and
to
see
the
excitement
and
interest
caused
by
the
arrival
he
knew
how
the
people
would
speak
of
the
beauty
of
the
little
lad
of
his
fine
strong
straight
body
of
his
erect
bearing
his
handsome
face
and
his
bright
hair
and
how
they
would
say
as
the
earl
had
heard
one
woman
exclaim
to
another
that
the
boy
was
every
inch
a
my
lord
of
dorincourt
was
an
arrogant
old
man
proud
of
his
name
proud
of
his
rank
and
therefore
proud
to
show
the
world
that
at
last
the
house
of
dorincourt
had
an
heir
who
was
worthy
of
the
position
he
was
to
fill
the
morning
the
new
pony
had
been
tried
the
earl
had
been
so
pleased
that
he
had
almost
forgotten
his
gout
when
the
groom
had
brought
out
the
pretty
creature
which
arched
its
brown
glossy
neck
and
tossed
its
fine
head
in
the
sun
the
earl
had
sat
at
the
open
window
of
the
library
and
had
looked
on
while
fauntleroy
took
his
first
riding
lesson
he
wondered
if
the
boy
would
show
signs
of
timidity
it
was
not
a
very
small
pony
and
he
had
often
seen
children
lose
courage
in
making
their
first
essay
at
riding
fauntleroy
mounted
in
great
delight
he
had
never
been
on
a
pony
before
and
he
was
in
the
highest
spirits
wilkins
the
groom
led
the
animal
by
the
bridle
up
and
down
before
the
library
window
he
a
well
plucked
un
he
is
wilkins
remarked
in
the
stable
afterward
with
many
grins
it
were
no
trouble
to
put
him
up
an
a
old
un
would
ha
sat
any
straighter
when
he
were
up
he
ses
ses
he
to
me
he
ses
i
sitting
up
straight
they
sit
up
straight
at
the
circus
ses
he
an
i
ses
straight
as
a
arrer
your
lordship
an
he
laughs
as
pleased
as
could
be
an
he
ses
right
he
ses
tell
me
if
i
do
sit
up
straight
wilkins
but
sitting
up
straight
and
being
led
at
a
walk
were
not
altogether
and
completely
satisfactory
after
a
few
minutes
fauntleroy
spoke
to
his
grandfather
watching
him
from
the
window
ca
i
go
by
myself
he
asked
and
ca
i
go
faster
the
boy
on
fifth
avenue
used
to
trot
and
canter
do
you
think
you
could
trot
and
canter
said
the
earl
i
should
like
to
try
answered
fauntleroy
his
lordship
made
a
sign
to
wilkins
who
at
the
signal
brought
up
his
own
horse
and
mounted
it
and
took
fauntleroy
pony
by
the
now
said
the
earl
let
him
the
next
few
minutes
were
rather
exciting
to
the
small
equestrian
he
found
that
trotting
was
not
so
easy
as
walking
and
the
faster
the
pony
trotted
the
less
easy
it
was
it
a
deal
it
he
said
to
wilkins
it
no
my
lord
answered
wilkins
you
get
used
to
it
in
time
rise
in
your
i
all
the
said
fauntleroy
he
was
both
rising
and
falling
rather
uncomfortably
and
with
many
shakes
and
bounces
he
was
out
of
breath
and
his
face
grew
red
but
he
held
on
with
all
his
might
and
sat
as
straight
as
he
could
the
earl
could
see
that
from
his
window
when
the
riders
came
back
within
speaking
distance
after
they
had
been
hidden
by
the
trees
a
few
minutes
fauntleroy
hat
was
off
his
cheeks
were
like
poppies
and
his
lips
were
set
but
he
was
still
trotting
manfully
stop
a
minute
said
his
grandfather
where
your
hat
wilkins
touched
his
it
fell
off
your
lordship
he
said
with
evident
enjoyment
would
let
me
stop
to
pick
it
up
my
not
much
afraid
is
he
asked
the
earl
dryly
him
your
lordship
exclaimed
wilkins
i
should
say
as
he
knowed
what
it
meant
i
taught
young
to
ride
afore
an
i
never
see
one
stick
on
more
tired
said
the
earl
to
fauntleroy
want
to
get
off
it
jolts
you
more
than
you
think
it
will
admitted
his
young
lordship
frankly
and
it
tires
you
a
little
too
but
i
do
want
to
get
off
i
want
to
learn
how
as
soon
as
i
got
my
breath
i
want
to
go
back
for
the
the
cleverest
person
in
the
world
if
he
had
undertaken
to
teach
fauntleroy
how
to
please
the
old
man
who
watched
him
could
not
have
taught
him
anything
which
would
have
succeeded
better
as
the
pony
trotted
off
again
toward
the
avenue
a
faint
color
crept
up
in
the
fierce
old
face
and
the
eyes
under
the
shaggy
brows
gleamed
with
a
pleasure
such
as
his
lordship
had
scarcely
expected
to
know
again
and
he
sat
and
watched
quite
eagerly
until
the
sound
of
the
horses
hoofs
returned
when
they
did
come
which
was
after
some
time
they
came
at
a
faster
pace
fauntleroy
hat
was
still
off
wilkins
was
carrying
it
for
him
his
cheeks
were
redder
than
before
and
his
hair
was
flying
about
his
ears
but
he
came
at
quite
a
brisk
canter
there
he
panted
as
they
drew
up
i
i
did
do
it
as
well
as
the
boy
on
fifth
avenue
but
i
did
it
and
i
staid
on
he
and
wilkins
and
the
pony
were
close
friends
after
that
scarcely
a
day
passed
in
which
the
country
people
did
not
see
them
out
together
cantering
gayly
on
the
highroad
or
through
the
green
lanes
the
children
in
the
cottages
would
run
to
the
door
to
look
at
the
proud
little
brown
pony
with
the
gallant
little
figure
sitting
so
straight
in
the
saddle
and
the
young
lord
would
snatch
off
his
cap
and
swing
it
at
them
and
shout
hullo
in
a
very
unlordly
manner
though
with
great
heartiness
sometimes
he
would
stop
and
talk
with
the
children
and
once
wilkins
came
back
to
the
castle
with
a
story
of
how
fauntleroy
had
insisted
on
dismounting
near
the
village
school
so
that
a
boy
who
was
lame
and
tired
might
ride
home
on
his
pony
an
i
blessed
said
wilkins
in
telling
the
story
at
the
stables
i
blessed
if
he
hear
of
anything
else
he
would
let
me
get
down
because
he
said
the
boy
might
feel
comfortable
on
a
big
horse
an
ses
he
ses
he
boy
lame
and
i
not
and
i
want
to
talk
to
him
too
and
up
the
lad
has
to
get
and
my
lord
trudges
alongside
of
him
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
cap
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
talking
as
easy
as
you
please
and
when
we
come
to
the
cottage
an
the
boy
mother
come
out
all
in
a
taking
to
see
what
up
he
whips
off
his
cap
an
ses
he
brought
your
son
home
ses
he
his
leg
hurt
him
and
i
think
that
stick
is
enough
for
him
to
lean
on
and
i
going
to
ask
my
grandfather
to
have
a
pair
of
crutches
made
for
him
an
i
blessed
if
the
woman
was
struck
all
of
a
heap
as
well
she
might
be
i
thought
i
should
myself
when
the
earl
heard
the
story
he
was
not
angry
as
wilkins
had
been
half
afraid
that
he
would
be
on
the
contrary
he
laughed
outright
and
called
fauntleroy
up
to
him
and
made
him
tell
all
about
the
matter
from
beginning
to
end
and
then
he
laughed
again
and
actually
a
few
days
later
the
dorincourt
carriage
stopped
in
the
green
lane
before
the
cottage
where
the
lame
boy
lived
and
fauntleroy
jumped
out
and
walked
up
to
the
door
carrying
a
pair
of
strong
light
new
crutches
shouldered
like
a
gun
and
presented
them
to
hartle
the
lame
name
was
hartle
with
these
words
my
grandfather
compliments
and
if
you
please
these
are
for
your
boy
and
we
hope
he
will
get
i
said
your
compliments
he
explained
to
the
earl
when
he
returned
to
the
carriage
you
did
tell
me
to
but
i
thought
perhaps
you
forgot
that
was
right
was
it
and
the
earl
laughed
again
and
did
not
say
it
was
not
in
fact
the
two
were
becoming
more
intimate
every
day
and
every
day
fauntleroy
faith
in
his
lordship
benevolence
and
virtue
increased
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
his
grandfather
was
the
most
amiable
and
generous
of
elderly
gentlemen
certainly
he
himself
found
his
wishes
gratified
almost
before
they
were
uttered
and
such
gifts
and
pleasures
were
lavished
upon
him
that
he
was
sometimes
almost
bewildered
by
his
own
possessions
apparently
he
was
to
have
everything
he
wanted
and
to
do
everything
he
wished
to
do
and
though
this
would
certainly
not
have
been
a
very
wise
plan
to
pursue
with
all
small
boys
his
young
lordship
bore
it
amazingly
well
perhaps
notwithstanding
his
sweet
nature
he
might
have
been
somewhat
spoiled
by
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
hours
he
spent
with
his
mother
at
court
lodge
that
best
friend
of
his
watched
over
him
ever
closely
and
tenderly
the
two
had
many
long
talks
together
and
he
never
went
back
to
the
castle
with
her
kisses
on
his
cheeks
without
carrying
in
his
heart
some
simple
pure
words
worth
remembering
there
was
one
thing
it
is
true
which
puzzled
the
little
fellow
very
much
he
thought
over
the
mystery
of
it
much
oftener
than
any
one
supposed
even
his
mother
did
not
know
how
often
he
pondered
on
it
the
earl
for
a
long
time
never
suspected
that
he
did
so
at
all
but
being
quick
to
observe
the
little
boy
could
not
help
wondering
why
it
was
that
his
mother
and
grandfather
never
seemed
to
meet
he
had
noticed
that
they
never
did
meet
when
the
dorincourt
carriage
stopped
at
court
lodge
the
earl
never
alighted
and
on
the
rare
occasions
of
his
lordship
going
to
church
fauntleroy
was
always
left
to
speak
to
his
mother
in
the
porch
alone
or
perhaps
to
go
home
with
her
and
yet
every
day
fruit
and
flowers
were
sent
to
court
lodge
from
the
at
the
castle
but
the
one
virtuous
action
of
the
which
had
set
him
upon
the
pinnacle
of
perfection
in
cedric
eyes
was
what
he
had
done
soon
after
that
first
sunday
when
errol
had
walked
home
from
church
unattended
about
a
week
later
when
cedric
was
going
one
day
to
visit
his
mother
he
found
at
the
door
instead
of
the
large
carriage
and
prancing
pair
a
pretty
little
brougham
and
a
handsome
bay
horse
that
is
a
present
from
you
to
your
mother
the
earl
said
abruptly
she
can
not
go
walking
about
the
country
she
needs
a
carriage
the
man
who
drives
will
take
charge
of
it
it
is
a
present
from
fauntleroy
delight
could
but
feebly
express
itself
he
could
scarcely
contain
himself
until
he
reached
the
lodge
his
mother
was
gathering
roses
in
the
garden
he
flung
himself
out
of
the
little
brougham
and
flew
to
her
dearest
he
cried
could
you
believe
it
this
is
yours
he
says
it
is
a
present
from
me
it
is
your
own
carriage
to
drive
everywhere
in
he
was
so
happy
that
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
she
could
not
have
borne
to
spoil
his
pleasure
by
refusing
to
accept
the
gift
even
though
it
came
from
the
man
who
chose
to
consider
himself
her
enemy
she
was
obliged
to
step
into
the
carriage
roses
and
all
and
let
herself
be
taken
to
drive
while
fauntleroy
told
her
stories
of
his
goodness
and
amiability
they
were
such
innocent
stories
that
sometimes
she
could
not
help
laughing
a
little
and
then
she
would
draw
her
little
boy
closer
to
her
side
and
kiss
him
feeling
glad
that
he
could
see
only
good
in
the
old
man
who
had
so
few
friends
the
very
next
day
after
that
fauntleroy
wrote
to
hobbs
he
wrote
quite
a
long
letter
and
after
the
first
copy
was
written
he
brought
it
to
his
grandfather
to
be
inspected
because
he
said
it
so
uncertain
about
the
spelling
and
if
tell
me
the
mistakes
i
write
it
out
this
was
what
he
had
written
my
dear
mr
hobbs
i
want
to
tell
you
about
my
granfarther
he
is
the
best
earl
you
ever
new
it
is
a
mistake
about
earls
being
tirents
he
is
not
a
tirent
at
all
i
wish
you
new
him
you
would
be
good
friends
i
am
sure

his
foot
and
is
a
grate
sufrer
but
he
is
so
pashent
i
love
him
more
every
day
becaus
no
one
could
help
loving
an
earl
like
that
who
is
kind
to
every
one
in
this
world
i
wish
you
could
talk
to
him
he
knows
everything
in
the
world
you
can
ask
him
any
question
but
he
has
never
plaid
base
ball
he
has
given
me
a
pony
and
a
cart
and
my
mamma
a
bewtifle
cariage
and
i
have
three
rooms
and
toys
of
all
kinds
it
would
serprise
you

would
like
the
castle
and
the
park

is
such
a
large
castle
you
could
lose
yourself
wilkins
tells
me
wilkins
is
my
groom
he
says
there
is
a
dungon
under
the
castle
it
is
so
pretty
everything
in
the
park
would
serprise
you
there
are
such
big
trees
and
there
are
deers
and
rabbits
and
games
flying
about
in
the
cover
my
granfarther
is
very
rich
but
he
is
not
proud
and
orty
as
you
thought
earls
always
were
i
like
to
be
with
him
the
people
are
so
polite
and
kind
they
take
of
their
hats
to
you
and
the
women
make
curtsies
and
sometimes
say
god
bless
you
i
can
ride
now
but
at
first
it
shook
me
when
i
troted
my
granfarther
let
a
poor
man
stay
on
his
farm
when
he
could
not
pay
his
rent
and
mrs
mellon
went
to
take
wine
and
things
to
his
sick
children
i
should
like
to
see
you
and
i
wish
dearest
could
live
at
the
castle
but
i
am
very
happy
when
i
dont
miss
her
too
much
and
i
love
my
granfarther
every
one
does
plees
write
soon
your
afechshnet
old
frend
cedric
errol
p
s
no
one
is
in
the
dungon
my
granfarfher
never
had
any
one
langwishin
in
there
p
s
he
is
such
a
good
earl
he
reminds
me
of
you
he
is
a
unerversle
favrit
do
you
miss
your
mother
very
much
asked
the
earl
when
he
had
finished
reading
this
yes
said
fauntleroy
i
miss
her
all
the
he
went
and
stood
before
the
earl
and
put
his
hand
on
his
knee
looking
up
at
him
you
do
miss
her
do
you
he
said
i
do
know
her
answered
his
lordship
rather
crustily
i
know
that
said
fauntleroy
and
that
what
makes
me
wonder
she
told
me
not
to
ask
you
any
questions
and
and
i
wo
but
sometimes
i
ca
help
thinking
you
know
and
it
makes
me
all
puzzled
but
i
not
going
to
ask
any
questions
and
when
i
miss
her
very
much
i
go
and
look
out
of
my
window
to
where
i
see
her
light
shine
for
me
every
night
through
an
open
place
in
the
trees
it
is
a
long
way
off
but
she
puts
it
in
her
window
as
soon
as
it
is
dark
and
i
can
see
it
twinkle
far
away
and
i
know
what
it
what
does
it
say
asked
my
lord
it
says
god
keep
you
all
the
night
just
what
she
used
to
say
when
we
were
together
every
night
she
used
to
say
that
to
me
and
every
morning
she
said
bless
you
all
the
day
so
you
see
i
am
quite
safe
all
the
time
quite
i
have
no
doubt
said
his
lordship
dryly
and
he
drew
down
his
beetling
eyebrows
and
looked
at
the
little
boy
so
fixedly
and
so
long
that
fauntleroy
wondered
what
he
could
be
thinking
of
ix
the
fact
was
his
lordship
the
earl
of
dorincourt
thought
in
those
days
of
many
things
of
which
he
had
never
thought
before
and
all
his
thoughts
were
in
one
way
or
another
connected
with
his
grandson
his
pride
was
the
strongest
part
of
his
nature
and
the
boy
gratified
it
at
every
point
through
this
pride
he
began
to
find
a
new
interest
in
life
he
began
to
take
pleasure
in
showing
his
heir
to
the
world
the
world
had
known
of
his
disappointment
in
his
sons
so
there
was
an
agreeable
touch
of
triumph
in
exhibiting
this
new
lord
fauntleroy
who
could
disappoint
no
one
he
wished
the
child
to
appreciate
his
own
power
and
to
understand
the
splendor
of
his
position
he
wished
that
others
should
realize
it
too
he
made
plans
for
his
future
sometimes
in
secret
he
actually
found
himself
wishing
that
his
own
past
life
had
been
a
better
one
and
that
there
had
been
less
in
it
that
this
pure
childish
heart
would
shrink
from
if
it
knew
the
truth
it
was
not
agreeable
to
think
how
the
beautiful
innocent
face
would
look
if
its
owner
should
be
made
by
any
chance
to
understand
that
his
grandfather
had
been
called
for
many
a
year
the
wicked
earl
of
the
thought
even
made
him
feel
a
trifle
nervous
he
did
not
wish
the
boy
to
find
it
out
sometimes
in
this
new
interest
he
forgot
his
gout
and
after
a
while
his
doctor
was
surprised
to
find
his
noble
health
growing
better
than
he
had
expected
it
ever
would
be
again
perhaps
the
earl
grew
better
because
the
time
did
not
pass
so
slowly
for
him
and
he
had
something
to
think
of
beside
his
pains
and
infirmities
one
fine
morning
people
were
amazed
to
see
little
lord
fauntleroy
riding
his
pony
with
another
companion
than
wilkins
this
new
companion
rode
a
tall
powerful
gray
horse
and
was
no
other
than
the
earl
himself
it
was
in
fact
fauntleroy
who
had
suggested
this
plan
as
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
mounting
his
pony
he
had
said
rather
wistfully
to
his
grandfather
i
wish
you
were
going
with
me
when
i
go
away
i
feel
lonely
because
you
are
left
all
by
yourself
in
such
a
big
castle
i
wish
you
could
ride
and
the
greatest
excitement
had
been
aroused
in
the
stables
a
few
minutes
later
by
the
arrival
of
an
order
that
selim
was
to
be
saddled
for
the
earl
after
that
selim
was
saddled
almost
every
day
and
the
people
became
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
the
tall
gray
horse
carrying
the
tall
gray
old
man
with
his
handsome
fierce
eagle
face
by
the
side
of
the
brown
pony
which
bore
little
lord
fauntleroy
and
in
their
rides
together
through
the
green
lanes
and
pretty
country
roads
the
two
riders
became
more
intimate
than
ever
and
gradually
the
old
man
heard
a
great
deal
about
dearest
and
her
life
as
fauntleroy
trotted
by
the
big
horse
he
chatted
gayly
there
could
not
well
have
been
a
brighter
little
comrade
his
nature
was
so
happy
it
was
he
who
talked
the
most
the
earl
often
was
silent
listening
and
watching
the
joyous
glowing
face
sometimes
he
would
tell
his
young
companion
to
set
the
pony
off
at
a
gallop
and
when
the
little
fellow
dashed
off
sitting
so
straight
and
fearless
he
would
watch
him
with
a
gleam
of
pride
and
pleasure
in
his
eyes
and
when
after
such
a
dash
fauntleroy
came
back
waving
his
cap
with
a
laughing
shout
he
always
felt
that
he
and
his
grandfather
were
very
good
friends
indeed
one
thing
that
the
earl
discovered
was
that
his
son
wife
did
not
lead
an
idle
life
it
was
not
long
before
he
learned
that
the
poor
people
knew
her
very
well
indeed
when
there
was
sickness
or
sorrow
or
poverty
in
any
house
the
little
brougham
often
stood
before
the
door
do
you
know
said
fauntleroy
once
they
all
say
bless
you
when
they
see
her
and
the
children
are
glad
there
are
some
who
go
to
her
house
to
be
taught
to
sew
she
says
she
feels
so
rich
now
that
she
wants
to
help
the
poor
it
had
not
displeased
the
earl
to
find
that
the
mother
of
his
heir
had
a
beautiful
young
face
and
looked
as
much
like
a
lady
as
if
she
had
been
a
duchess
and
in
one
way
it
did
not
displease
him
to
know
that
she
was
popular
and
beloved
by
the
poor
and
yet
he
was
often
conscious
of
a
hard
jealous
pang
when
he
saw
how
she
filled
her
child
heart
and
how
the
boy
clung
to
her
as
his
best
beloved
the
old
man
would
have
desired
to
stand
first
himself
and
have
no
rival
that
same
morning
he
drew
up
his
horse
on
an
elevated
point
of
the
moor
over
which
they
rode
and
made
a
gesture
with
his
whip
over
the
broad
beautiful
landscape
spread
before
them
do
you
know
that
all
that
land
belongs
to
me
he
said
to
fauntleroy
does
it
answered
fauntleroy
how
much
it
is
to
belong
to
one
person
and
how
beautiful
do
you
know
that
some
day
it
will
all
belong
to
you
that
and
a
great
deal
more
to
me
exclaimed
fauntleroy
in
rather
an
voice
when
when
i
am
dead
his
grandfather
answered
then
i
do
want
it
said
fauntleroy
i
want
you
to
live
that
kind
answered
the
earl
in
his
dry
way
nevertheless
some
day
it
will
all
be
yours
some
day
you
will
be
the
earl
of
little
lord
fauntleroy
sat
very
still
in
his
saddle
for
a
few
moments
he
looked
over
the
broad
moors
the
green
farms
the
beautiful
copses
the
cottages
in
the
lanes
the
pretty
village
and
over
the
trees
to
where
the
turrets
of
the
great
castle
rose
gray
and
stately
then
he
gave
a
queer
little
sigh
what
are
you
thinking
of
asked
the
earl
i
am
thinking
replied
fauntleroy
what
a
little
boy
i
am
and
of
what
dearest
said
to
what
was
it
inquired
the
earl
she
said
that
perhaps
it
was
not
so
easy
to
be
very
rich
that
if
any
one
had
so
many
things
always
one
might
sometimes
forget
that
every
one
else
was
not
so
fortunate
and
that
one
who
is
rich
should
always
be
careful
and
try
to
remember
i
was
talking
to
her
about
how
good
you
were
and
she
said
that
was
such
a
good
thing
because
an
earl
had
so
much
power
and
if
he
cared
only
about
his
own
pleasure
and
never
thought
about
the
people
who
lived
on
his
lands
they
might
have
trouble
that
he
could
help
and
there
were
so
many
people
and
it
would
be
such
a
hard
thing
and
i
was
just
looking
at
all
those
houses
and
thinking
how
i
should
have
to
find
out
about
the
people
when
i
was
an
earl
how
did
you
find
out
about
them
as
his
lordship
knowledge
of
his
tenantry
consisted
in
finding
out
which
of
them
paid
their
rent
promptly
and
in
turning
out
those
who
did
not
this
was
rather
a
hard
question
newick
finds
out
for
me
he
said
and
he
pulled
his
great
gray
mustache
and
looked
at
his
small
questioner
rather
uneasily
we
will
go
home
now
he
added
and
when
you
are
an
earl
see
to
it
that
you
are
a
better
earl
than
i
have
been
he
was
very
silent
as
they
rode
home
he
felt
it
to
be
almost
incredible
that
he
who
had
never
really
loved
any
one
in
his
life
should
find
himself
growing
so
fond
of
this
little
fellow
as
without
doubt
he
was
at
first
he
had
only
been
pleased
and
proud
of
cedric
beauty
and
bravery
but
there
was
something
more
than
pride
in
his
feeling
now
he
laughed
a
grim
dry
laugh
all
to
himself
sometimes
when
he
thought
how
he
liked
to
have
the
boy
near
him
how
he
liked
to
hear
his
voice
and
how
in
secret
he
really
wished
to
be
liked
and
thought
well
of
by
his
small
grandson
i
an
old
fellow
in
my
dotage
and
i
have
nothing
else
to
think
of
he
would
say
to
himself
and
yet
he
knew
it
was
not
that
altogether
and
if
he
had
allowed
himself
to
admit
the
truth
he
would
perhaps
have
found
himself
obliged
to
own
that
the
very
things
which
attracted
him
in
spite
of
himself
were
the
qualities
he
had
never
possessed
the
frank
true
kindly
nature
the
affectionate
trustfulness
which
could
never
think
evil
it
was
only
about
a
week
after
that
ride
when
after
a
visit
to
his
mother
fauntleroy
came
into
the
library
with
a
troubled
thoughtful
face
he
sat
down
in
that
chair
in
which
he
had
sat
on
the
evening
of
his
arrival
and
for
a
while
he
looked
at
the
embers
on
the
hearth
the
earl
watched
him
in
silence
wondering
what
was
coming
it
was
evident
that
cedric
had
something
on
his
mind
at
last
he
looked
up
does
newick
know
all
about
the
people
he
asked
it
is
his
business
to
know
about
them
said
his
lordship
been
neglecting
it
has
he
contradictory
as
it
may
seem
there
was
nothing
which
entertained
and
edified
him
more
than
the
little
fellow
interest
in
his
tenantry
he
had
never
taken
any
interest
in
them
himself
but
it
pleased
him
well
enough
that
with
all
his
childish
habits
of
thought
and
in
the
midst
of
all
his
childish
amusements
and
high
spirits
there
should
be
such
a
quaint
seriousness
working
in
the
curly
head
there
is
a
place
said
fauntleroy
looking
up
at
him
with
eye
dearest
has
seen
it
it
is
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
the
houses
are
close
together
and
almost
falling
down
you
can
scarcely
breathe
and
the
people
are
so
poor
and
everything
is
dreadful
often
they
have
fever
and
the
children
die
and
it
makes
them
wicked
to
live
like
that
and
be
so
poor
and
miserable
it
is
worse
than
michael
and
bridget
the
rain
comes
in
at
the
roof
dearest
went
to
see
a
poor
woman
who
lived
there
she
would
not
let
me
come
near
her
until
she
had
changed
all
her
things
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
when
she
told
me
about
it
the
tears
had
come
into
his
own
eyes
but
he
smiled
through
them
i
told
her
you
did
know
and
i
would
tell
you
he
said
he
jumped
down
and
came
and
leaned
against
the
earl
chair
you
can
make
it
all
right
he
said
just
as
you
made
it
all
right
for
higgins
you
always
make
it
all
right
for
everybody
i
told
her
you
would
and
that
newick
must
have
forgotten
to
tell
the
earl
looked
down
at
the
hand
on
his
knee
newick
had
not
forgotten
to
tell
him
in
fact
newick
had
spoken
to
him
more
than
once
of
the
desperate
condition
of
the
end
of
the
village
known
as
earl
court
he
knew
all
about
the
miserable
cottages
and
the
bad
drainage
and
the
damp
walls
and
broken
windows
and
leaking
roofs
and
all
about
the
poverty
the
fever
and
the
misery
mordaunt
had
painted
it
all
to
him
in
the
strongest
words
he
could
use
and
his
lordship
had
used
violent
language
in
response
and
when
his
gout
had
been
at
the
worst
he
said
that
the
sooner
the
people
of
earl
court
died
and
were
buried
by
the
parish
the
better
it
would
be
and
there
was
an
end
of
the
matter
and
yet
as
he
looked
at
the
small
hand
on
his
knee
and
from
the
small
hand
to
the
honest
earnest
face
he
was
actually
a
little
ashamed
both
of
earl
court
and
himself
what
he
said
you
want
to
make
a
builder
of
model
cottages
of
me
do
you
and
he
positively
put
his
own
hand
upon
the
childish
one
and
stroked
it
those
must
be
pulled
down
said
fauntleroy
with
great
eagerness
dearest
says
so
let
us
let
us
go
and
have
them
pulled
down
the
people
will
be
so
glad
when
they
see
you
they
know
you
have
come
to
help
them
and
his
eyes
shone
like
stars
in
his
glowing
face
the
earl
rose
from
his
chair
and
put
his
hand
on
the
child
shoulder
let
us
go
out
and
take
our
walk
on
the
terrace
he
said
with
a
short
laugh
and
we
can
talk
it
and
though
he
laughed
two
or
three
times
again
as
they
walked
to
and
fro
on
the
broad
stone
terrace
where
they
walked
together
almost
every
fine
evening
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
something
which
did
not
displease
him
and
still
he
kept
his
hand
on
his
small
shoulder
x
the
truth
was
that
errol
had
found
a
great
many
sad
things
in
the
course
of
her
work
among
the
poor
of
the
little
village
that
appeared
so
picturesque
when
it
was
seen
from
the
everything
was
not
as
picturesque
when
seen
near
by
as
it
looked
from
a
distance
she
had
found
idleness
and
poverty
and
ignorance
where
there
should
have
been
comfort
and
industry
and
she
had
discovered
after
a
while
that
erleboro
was
considered
to
be
the
worst
village
in
that
part
of
the
country
mordaunt
had
told
her
a
great
many
of
his
difficulties
and
discouragements
and
she
had
found
out
a
great
deal
by
herself
the
agents
who
had
managed
the
property
had
always
been
chosen
to
please
the
earl
and
had
cared
nothing
for
the
degradation
and
wretchedness
of
the
poor
tenants
many
things
therefore
had
been
neglected
which
should
have
been
attended
to
and
matters
had
gone
from
bad
to
worse
as
to
earl
court
it
was
a
disgrace
with
its
dilapidated
houses
and
miserable
careless
sickly
people
when
first
errol
went
to
the
place
it
made
her
shudder
such
ugliness
and
slovenliness
and
want
seemed
worse
in
a
country
place
than
in
a
city
it
seemed
as
if
there
it
might
be
helped
and
as
she
looked
at
the
squalid
children
growing
up
in
the
midst
of
vice
and
brutal
indifference
she
thought
of
her
own
little
boy
spending
his
days
in
the
great
splendid
castle
guarded
and
served
like
a
young
prince
having
no
wish
ungratified
and
knowing
nothing
but
luxury
and
ease
and
beauty
and
a
bold
thought
came
in
her
wise
little
gradually
she
had
begun
to
see
as
had
others
that
it
had
been
her
boy
good
fortune
to
please
the
earl
very
much
and
that
he
would
scarcely
be
likely
to
be
denied
anything
for
which
he
expressed
a
desire
the
earl
would
give
him
anything
she
said
to
mordaunt
he
would
indulge
his
every
whim
why
should
not
that
indulgence
be
used
for
the
good
of
others
it
is
for
me
to
see
that
this
shall
come
to
she
knew
she
could
trust
the
kind
childish
heart
so
she
told
the
little
fellow
the
story
of
earl
court
feeling
sure
that
he
would
speak
of
it
to
his
grandfather
and
hoping
that
some
good
results
would
follow
and
strange
as
it
appeared
to
every
one
good
results
did
follow
the
fact
was
that
the
strongest
power
to
influence
the
earl
was
his
grandson
perfect
confidence
in
him
the
fact
that
cedric
always
believed
that
his
grandfather
was
going
to
do
what
was
right
and
generous
he
could
not
quite
make
up
his
mind
to
let
him
discover
that
he
had
no
inclination
to
be
generous
at
all
and
that
he
wanted
his
own
way
on
all
occasions
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong
it
was
such
a
novelty
to
be
regarded
with
admiration
as
a
benefactor
of
the
entire
human
race
and
the
soul
of
nobility
that
he
did
not
enjoy
the
idea
of
looking
into
the
affectionate
brown
eyes
and
saying
i
am
a
violent
selfish
old
rascal
i
never
did
a
generous
thing
in
my
life
and
i
care
about
earl
court
or
the
poor
people
or
something
which
would
amount
to
the
same
thing
he
actually
had
learned
to
be
fond
enough
of
that
small
boy
with
the
mop
of
yellow
to
feel
that
he
himself
would
prefer
to
be
guilty
of
an
amiable
action
now
and
then
and
so
though
he
laughed
at
himself
after
some
reflection
he
sent
for
newick
and
had
quite
a
long
interview
with
him
on
the
subject
of
the
court
and
it
was
decided
that
the
wretched
hovels
should
be
pulled
down
and
new
houses
should
be
built
it
is
lord
fauntleroy
who
insists
on
it
he
said
dryly
he
thinks
it
will
improve
the
property
you
can
tell
the
tenants
that
it
his
and
he
looked
down
at
his
small
lordship
who
was
lying
on
the
playing
with
dougal
the
great
dog
was
the
lad
constant
companion
and
followed
him
about
everywhere
stalking
solemnly
after
him
when
he
walked
and
trotting
majestically
behind
when
he
rode
or
drove
of
course
both
the
country
people
and
the
town
people
heard
of
the
proposed
improvement
at
first
many
of
them
would
not
believe
it
but
when
a
small
army
of
workmen
arrived
and
commenced
pulling
down
the
crazy
squalid
cottages
people
began
to
understand
that
little
lord
fauntleroy
had
done
them
a
good
turn
again
and
that
through
his
innocent
interference
the
scandal
of
earl
court
had
at
last
been
removed
if
he
had
only
known
how
they
talked
about
him
and
praised
him
everywhere
and
prophesied
great
things
for
him
when
he
grew
up
how
astonished
he
would
have
been
but
he
never
suspected
it
he
lived
his
simple
happy
child
life
frolicking
about
in
the
park
chasing
the
rabbits
to
their
burrows
lying
under
the
trees
on
the
grass
or
on
the
rug
in
the
library
reading
wonderful
books
and
talking
to
the
earl
about
them
and
then
telling
the
stories
again
to
his
mother
writing
long
letters
to
dick
and
hobbs
who
responded
in
characteristic
fashion
riding
out
at
his
grandfather
side
or
with
wilkins
as
escort
as
they
rode
through
the
market
town
he
used
to
see
the
people
turn
and
look
and
he
noticed
that
as
they
lifted
their
hats
their
faces
often
brightened
very
much
but
he
thought
it
was
all
because
his
grandfather
was
with
him
they
are
so
fond
of
you
he
once
said
looking
up
at
his
lordship
with
a
bright
smile
do
you
see
how
glad
they
are
when
they
see
you
i
hope
they
will
some
day
be
as
fond
of
me
it
must
be
nice
to
have
everybody
like
and
he
felt
quite
proud
to
be
the
grandson
of
so
greatly
admired
and
beloved
an
individual
when
the
cottages
were
being
built
the
lad
and
his
grandfather
used
to
ride
over
to
earl
court
together
to
look
at
them
and
fauntleroy
was
full
of
interest
he
would
dismount
from
his
pony
and
go
and
make
acquaintance
with
the
workmen
asking
them
questions
about
building
and
bricklaying
and
telling
them
things
about
america
after
two
or
three
such
conversations
he
was
able
to
enlighten
the
earl
on
the
subject
of
as
they
rode
home
i
always
like
to
know
about
things
like
those
he
said
because
you
never
know
what
you
are
coming
when
he
left
them
the
workmen
used
to
talk
him
over
among
themselves
and
laugh
at
his
odd
innocent
speeches
but
they
liked
him
and
liked
to
see
him
stand
among
them
talking
away
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
hat
pushed
back
on
his
curls
and
his
small
face
full
of
eagerness
he
a
rare
un
they
used
to
say
an
a
noice
little
outspoken
chap
too
not
much
o
th
bad
stock
in
and
they
would
go
home
and
tell
their
wives
about
him
and
the
women
would
tell
each
other
and
so
it
came
about
that
almost
every
one
talked
of
or
knew
some
story
of
little
lord
fauntleroy
and
gradually
almost
every
one
knew
that
the
wicked
earl
had
found
something
he
cared
for
at
last
something
which
had
touched
and
even
warmed
his
hard
bitter
old
heart
but
no
one
knew
quite
how
much
it
had
been
warmed
and
how
day
by
day
the
old
man
found
himself
caring
more
and
more
for
the
child
who
was
the
only
creature
that
had
ever
trusted
him
he
found
himself
looking
forward
to
the
time
when
cedric
would
be
a
young
man
strong
and
beautiful
with
life
all
before
him
but
having
still
that
kind
heart
and
the
power
to
make
friends
everywhere
and
the
earl
wondered
what
the
lad
would
do
and
how
he
would
use
his
gifts
often
as
he
watched
the
little
fellow
lying
upon
the
hearth
conning
some
big
book
the
light
shining
on
the
bright
young
head
his
old
eyes
would
gleam
and
his
cheek
would
flush
the
boy
can
do
anything
he
would
say
to
himself
anything
he
never
spoke
to
any
one
else
of
his
feeling
for
cedric
when
he
spoke
of
him
to
others
it
was
always
with
the
same
grim
smile
but
fauntleroy
soon
knew
that
his
grandfather
loved
him
and
always
liked
him
to
be
near
near
to
his
chair
if
they
were
in
the
library
opposite
to
him
at
table
or
by
his
side
when
he
rode
or
drove
or
took
his
evening
walk
on
the
broad
terrace
do
you
remember
cedric
said
once
looking
up
from
his
book
as
he
lay
on
the
rug
do
you
remember
what
i
said
to
you
that
first
night
about
our
being
good
companions
i
do
think
any
people
could
be
better
companions
than
we
are
do
you
we
are
pretty
good
companions
i
should
say
replied
his
lordship
come
fauntleroy
scrambled
up
and
went
to
him
is
there
anything
you
want
the
earl
asked
anything
you
have
not
the
little
fellow
brown
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
his
grandfather
with
a
rather
wistful
look
only
one
thing
he
answered
what
is
that
inquired
the
earl
fauntleroy
was
silent
a
second
he
had
not
thought
matters
over
to
himself
so
long
for
nothing
what
is
it
my
lord
repeated
fauntleroy
answered
it
is
dearest
he
said
the
old
earl
winced
a
little
but
you
see
her
almost
every
day
he
said
is
not
that
enough
i
used
to
see
her
all
the
time
said
fauntleroy
she
used
to
kiss
me
when
i
went
to
sleep
at
night
and
in
the
morning
she
was
always
there
and
we
could
tell
each
other
things
without
the
old
eyes
and
the
young
ones
looked
into
each
other
through
a
moment
of
silence
then
the
earl
knitted
his
brows
do
you
never
forget
about
your
mother
he
said
no
answered
fauntleroy
never
and
she
never
forgets
about
me
i
should
forget
about
you
you
know
if
i
did
live
with
you
i
should
think
about
you
all
the
upon
my
word
said
the
earl
after
looking
at
him
a
moment
longer
i
believe
you
would
the
jealous
pang
that
came
when
the
boy
spoke
so
of
his
mother
seemed
even
stronger
than
it
had
been
before
it
was
stronger
because
of
this
old
man
increasing
affection
for
the
boy
but
it
was
not
long
before
he
had
other
pangs
so
much
harder
to
face
that
he
almost
forgot
for
the
time
he
had
ever
hated
his
son
wife
at
all
and
in
a
strange
and
startling
way
it
happened
one
evening
just
before
the
earl
court
cottages
were
completed
there
was
a
grand
dinner
party
at
dorincourt
there
had
not
been
such
a
party
at
the
castle
for
a
long
time
a
few
days
before
it
took
place
sir
harry
lorridaile
and
lady
lorridaile
who
was
the
earl
only
sister
actually
came
for
a
visit
a
thing
which
caused
the
greatest
excitement
in
the
village
and
set
dibble
tinkling
madly
again
because
it
was
well
known
that
lady
lorridaile
had
only
been
to
dorincourt
once
since
her
marriage
years
before
she
was
a
handsome
old
lady
with
white
curls
and
dimpled
peachy
cheeks
and
she
was
as
good
as
gold
but
she
had
never
approved
of
her
brother
any
more
than
did
the
rest
of
the
world
and
having
a
strong
will
of
her
own
and
not
being
at
all
afraid
to
speak
her
mind
frankly
she
had
after
several
lively
quarrels
with
his
lordship
seen
very
little
of
him
since
her
young
days
she
had
heard
a
great
deal
of
him
that
was
not
pleasant
through
the
years
in
which
they
had
been
separated
she
had
heard
about
his
neglect
of
his
wife
and
of
the
poor
lady
death
and
of
his
indifference
to
his
children
and
of
the
two
weak
vicious
unprepossessing
elder
boys
who
had
been
no
credit
to
him
or
to
any
one
else
those
two
elder
sons
bevis
and
maurice
she
had
never
seen
but
once
there
had
come
to
lorridaile
park
a
tall
stalwart
beautiful
young
fellow
about
eighteen
years
old
who
had
told
her
that
he
was
her
nephew
cedric
errol
and
that
he
had
come
to
see
her
because
he
was
passing
near
the
place
and
wished
to
look
at
his
aunt
constantia
of
whom
he
had
heard
his
mother
speak
lady
lorridaile
kind
heart
had
warmed
through
and
through
at
the
sight
of
the
young
man
and
she
had
made
him
stay
with
her
a
week
and
petted
him
and
made
much
of
him
and
admired
him
immensely
he
was
so
spirited
a
lad
that
when
he
went
away
she
had
hoped
to
see
him
often
again
but
she
never
did
because
the
earl
had
been
in
a
bad
humor
when
he
went
back
to
dorincourt
and
had
forbidden
him
ever
to
go
to
lorridaile
park
again
but
lady
lorridaile
had
always
remembered
him
tenderly
and
though
she
feared
he
had
made
a
rash
marriage
in
america
she
had
been
very
angry
when
she
heard
how
he
had
been
cast
off
by
his
father
and
that
no
one
really
knew
where
or
how
he
lived
at
last
there
came
a
rumor
of
his
death
and
then
bevis
had
been
thrown
from
his
horse
and
killed
and
maurice
had
died
in
rome
of
the
fever
and
soon
after
came
the
story
of
the
american
child
who
was
to
be
found
and
brought
home
as
lord
fauntleroy
probably
to
be
ruined
as
the
others
were
she
said
to
her
husband
unless
his
mother
is
good
enough
and
has
a
will
of
her
own
to
help
her
to
take
care
of
but
when
she
heard
that
cedric
mother
had
been
parted
from
him
she
was
almost
too
indignant
for
words
it
is
disgraceful
harry
she
said
fancy
a
child
of
that
age
being
taken
from
his
mother
and
made
the
companion
of
a
man
like
my
brother
he
will
either
be
brutal
to
the
boy
or
indulge
him
until
he
is
a
little
monster
if
i
thought
it
would
do
any
good
to
write
it
would
constantia
said
sir
harry
i
know
it
would
she
answered
i
know
his
lordship
the
earl
of
dorincourt
too
well
but
it
is
not
only
the
poor
people
and
farmers
heard
about
little
lord
fauntleroy
others
knew
him
he
was
talked
about
so
much
and
there
were
so
many
stories
of
him
of
his
beauty
his
sweet
temper
his
popularity
and
his
growing
influence
over
the
earl
his
grandfather
that
rumors
of
him
reached
the
gentry
at
their
country
places
and
he
was
heard
of
in
more
than
one
county
of
england
people
talked
about
him
at
the
dinner
tables
ladies
pitied
his
young
mother
and
wondered
if
the
boy
were
as
handsome
as
he
was
said
to
be
and
men
who
knew
the
earl
and
his
habits
laughed
heartily
at
the
stories
of
the
little
fellow
belief
in
his
lordship
amiability
sir
thomas
asshe
of
asshawe
hall
being
in
erleboro
one
day
met
the
earl
and
his
grandson
riding
together
and
stopped
to
shake
hands
with
my
lord
and
congratulate
him
on
his
change
of
looks
and
on
his
recovery
from
the
gout
and
d
ye
know
he
said
when
he
spoke
of
the
incident
afterward
the
old
man
looked
as
proud
as
a
and
upon
my
word
i
do
wonder
for
a
handsomer
finer
lad
than
his
grandson
i
never
saw
as
straight
as
a
dart
and
sat
his
pony
like
a
young
trooper
and
so
by
degrees
lady
lorridaile
too
heard
of
the
child
she
heard
about
higgins
and
the
lame
boy
and
the
cottages
at
earl
court
and
a
score
of
other
things
and
she
began
to
wish
to
see
the
little
fellow
and
just
as
she
was
wondering
how
it
might
be
brought
about
to
her
utter
astonishment
she
received
a
letter
from
her
brother
inviting
her
to
come
with
her
husband
to
dorincourt
it
seems
incredible
she
exclaimed
i
have
heard
it
said
that
the
child
has
worked
miracles
and
i
begin
to
believe
it
they
say
my
brother
adores
the
boy
and
can
scarcely
endure
to
have
him
out
of
sight
and
he
is
so
proud
of
him
actually
i
believe
he
wants
to
show
him
to
and
she
accepted
the
invitation
at
once
when
she
reached
dorincourt
castle
with
sir
harry
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
she
went
to
her
room
at
once
before
seeing
her
brother
having
dressed
for
dinner
she
entered
the
the
earl
was
there
standing
near
the
fire
and
looking
very
tall
and
imposing
and
at
his
side
stood
a
little
boy
in
black
velvet
and
a
large
vandyke
collar
of
rich
lace
a
little
fellow
whose
round
bright
face
was
so
handsome
and
who
turned
upon
her
such
beautiful
candid
brown
eyes
that
she
almost
uttered
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
and
surprise
at
the
sight
as
she
shook
hands
with
the
earl
she
called
him
by
the
name
she
had
not
used
since
her
girlhood
what
molyneux
she
said
is
this
the
child
yes
constantia
answered
the
earl
this
is
the
boy
fauntleroy
this
is
your
lady
how
do
you
do
said
fauntleroy
lady
lorridaile
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulders
and
after
looking
down
into
his
upraised
face
a
few
seconds
kissed
him
warmly
i
am
your
aunt
constantia
she
said
and
i
loved
your
poor
papa
and
you
are
very
like
it
makes
me
glad
when
i
am
told
i
am
like
him
answered
fauntleroy
because
it
seems
as
if
every
one
liked
him
just
like
dearest
eszackly
aunt
constantia
adding
the
two
words
after
a
pause
lady
lorridaile
was
delighted
she
bent
and
kissed
him
again
and
from
that
moment
they
were
warm
friends
well
molyneux
she
said
aside
to
the
earl
afterward
it
could
not
possibly
be
better
than
this
i
think
not
answered
his
lordship
dryly
he
is
a
fine
little
fellow
we
are
great
friends
he
believes
me
to
be
the
most
charming
and
of
philanthropists
i
will
confess
to
you
constantia
as
you
would
find
it
out
if
i
did
not
that
i
am
in
some
slight
danger
of
becoming
rather
an
old
fool
about
what
does
his
mother
think
of
you
asked
lady
lorridaile
with
her
usual
straightforwardness
i
have
not
asked
her
answered
the
earl
slightly
scowling
well
said
lady
lorridaile
i
will
be
frank
with
you
at
the
outset
molyneux
and
tell
you
i
do
approve
of
your
course
and
that
it
is
my
intention
to
call
on
errol
as
soon
as
possible
so
if
you
wish
to
quarrel
with
me
you
had
better
mention
it
at
once
what
i
hear
of
the
young
creature
makes
me
quite
sure
that
her
child
owes
her
everything
we
were
told
even
at
lorridaile
park
that
your
poorer
tenants
adore
her
they
adore
him
said
the
earl
nodding
toward
fauntleroy
as
to
errol
you
find
her
a
pretty
little
woman
i
rather
in
debt
to
her
for
giving
some
of
her
beauty
to
the
boy
and
you
can
go
to
see
her
if
you
like
all
i
ask
is
that
she
will
remain
at
court
lodge
and
that
you
will
not
ask
me
to
go
and
see
her
and
he
scowled
a
little
again
but
he
does
hate
her
as
much
as
he
used
to
that
is
plain
enough
to
me
her
ladyship
said
to
sir
harry
afterward
and
he
is
a
changed
man
in
a
measure
and
incredible
as
it
may
seem
harry
it
is
my
opinion
that
he
is
being
made
into
a
human
being
through
nothing
more
nor
less
than
his
affection
for
that
innocent
affectionate
little
fellow
why
the
child
actually
loves
him
leans
on
his
chair
and
against
his
knee
his
own
children
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
nestling
up
to
a
the
very
next
day
she
went
to
call
upon
errol
when
she
returned
she
said
to
her
brother
molyneux
she
is
the
loveliest
little
woman
i
ever
saw
she
has
a
voice
like
a
silver
bell
and
you
may
thank
her
for
making
the
boy
what
he
is
she
has
given
him
more
than
her
beauty
and
you
make
a
great
mistake
in
not
persuading
her
to
come
and
take
charge
of
you
i
shall
invite
her
to
she
not
leave
the
boy
replied
the
earl
i
must
have
the
boy
too
said
lady
lorridaile
laughing
but
she
knew
fauntleroy
would
not
be
given
up
to
her
and
each
day
she
saw
more
clearly
how
closely
those
two
had
grown
to
each
other
and
how
all
the
proud
grim
old
man
ambition
and
hope
and
love
centered
themselves
in
the
child
and
how
the
warm
innocent
nature
returned
his
affection
with
most
perfect
trust
and
good
faith
she
knew
too
that
the
prime
reason
for
the
great
dinner
party
was
the
earl
secret
desire
to
show
the
world
his
grandson
and
heir
and
to
let
people
see
that
the
boy
who
had
been
so
much
spoken
of
and
described
was
even
a
finer
little
specimen
of
boyhood
than
rumor
had
made
him
bevis
and
maurice
were
such
a
bitter
humiliation
to
him
she
said
to
her
husband
every
one
knew
it
he
actually
hated
them
his
pride
has
full
sway
perhaps
there
was
not
one
person
who
accepted
the
invitation
without
feeling
some
curiosity
about
little
lord
fauntleroy
and
wondering
if
he
would
be
on
view
and
when
the
time
came
he
was
on
view
the
lad
has
good
manners
said
the
earl
he
will
be
in
no
way
children
are
usually
idiots
or
bores
mine
were
both
but
he
can
actually
answer
when
he
spoken
to
and
be
silent
when
he
is
not
he
is
never
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
be
silent
very
long
every
one
had
something
to
say
to
him
the
fact
was
they
wished
to
make
him
talk
the
ladies
petted
him
and
asked
him
questions
and
the
men
asked
him
questions
too
and
joked
with
him
as
the
men
on
the
steamer
had
done
when
he
crossed
the
atlantic
fauntleroy
did
not
quite
understand
why
they
laughed
so
sometimes
when
he
answered
them
but
he
was
so
used
to
seeing
people
amused
when
he
was
quite
serious
that
he
did
not
mind
he
thought
the
whole
evening
delightful
the
magnificent
rooms
were
so
brilliant
with
lights
there
were
so
many
flowers
the
gentlemen
seemed
so
gay
and
the
ladies
wore
such
beautiful
wonderful
dresses
and
such
sparkling
ornaments
in
their
hair
and
on
their
necks
there
was
one
young
lady
who
he
heard
them
say
had
just
come
down
from
london
where
she
had
spent
the
season
and
she
was
so
charming
that
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
from
her
she
was
a
rather
tall
young
lady
with
a
proud
little
head
and
very
soft
dark
hair
and
large
eyes
the
color
of
purple
pansies
and
the
color
on
her
cheeks
and
lips
was
like
that
of
a
rose
she
was
dressed
in
a
beautiful
white
dress
and
had
pearls
around
her
throat
there
was
one
strange
thing
about
this
young
lady
so
many
gentlemen
stood
near
her
and
seemed
anxious
to
please
her
that
fauntleroy
thought
she
must
be
something
like
a
princess
he
was
so
much
interested
in
her
that
without
knowing
it
he
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
her
and
at
last
she
turned
and
spoke
to
him
come
here
lord
fauntleroy
she
said
smiling
and
tell
me
why
you
look
at
me
i
was
thinking
how
beautiful
you
are
his
young
lordship
replied
then
all
the
gentlemen
laughed
outright
and
the
young
lady
laughed
a
little
too
and
the
rose
color
in
her
cheeks
brightened
ah
fauntleroy
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
had
laughed
most
heartily
make
the
most
of
your
time
when
you
are
older
you
will
not
have
the
courage
to
say
but
nobody
could
help
saying
it
said
fauntleroy
sweetly
could
you
help
it
do
you
think
she
is
pretty
too
we
are
not
allowed
to
say
what
we
think
said
the
gentleman
while
the
rest
laughed
more
than
ever
but
the
beautiful
young
lady
her
name
was
miss
vivian
herbert
put
out
her
hand
and
drew
cedric
to
her
side
looking
prettier
than
before
if
possible
lord
fauntleroy
shall
say
what
he
thinks
she
said
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
him
i
am
sure
he
thinks
what
he
and
she
kissed
him
on
his
cheek
i
think
you
are
prettier
than
any
one
i
ever
saw
said
fauntleroy
looking
at
her
with
innocent
admiring
eyes
except
dearest
of
course
i
could
think
any
one
quite
as
pretty
as
dearest
i
think
she
is
the
prettiest
person
in
the
i
am
sure
she
is
said
miss
vivian
herbert
and
she
laughed
and
kissed
his
cheek
again
she
kept
him
by
her
side
a
great
part
of
the
evening
and
the
group
of
which
they
were
the
center
was
very
gay
he
did
not
know
how
it
happened
but
before
long
he
was
telling
them
all
about
america
and
the
republican
rally
and
hobbs
and
dick
and
in
the
end
he
proudly
produced
from
his
pocket
dick
parting
gift
the
red
silk
handkerchief
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
because
it
was
a
party
he
said
i
thought
dick
would
like
me
to
wear
it
at
a
and
queer
as
the
big
flaming
spotted
thing
was
there
was
a
serious
affectionate
look
in
his
eyes
which
prevented
his
audience
from
laughing
very
much
you
see
i
like
it
he
said
because
dick
is
my
but
though
he
was
talked
to
so
much
as
the
earl
had
said
he
was
in
no
one
way
he
could
be
quiet
and
listen
when
others
talked
and
so
no
one
found
him
tiresome
a
slight
smile
crossed
more
than
one
face
when
several
times
he
went
and
stood
near
his
grandfather
chair
or
sat
on
a
stool
close
to
him
watching
him
and
absorbing
every
word
he
uttered
with
the
most
charmed
interest
once
he
stood
so
near
the
chair
arm
that
his
cheek
touched
the
earl
shoulder
and
his
lordship
detecting
the
general
smile
smiled
a
little
himself
he
knew
what
the
were
thinking
and
he
felt
some
secret
amusement
in
their
seeing
what
good
friends
he
was
with
this
youngster
who
might
have
been
expected
to
share
the
popular
opinion
of
him
havisham
had
been
expected
to
arrive
in
the
afternoon
but
strange
to
say
he
was
late
such
a
thing
had
really
never
been
known
to
happen
before
during
all
the
years
in
which
he
had
been
a
visitor
at
dorincourt
castle
he
was
so
late
that
the
guests
were
on
the
point
of
rising
to
go
in
to
dinner
when
he
arrived
when
he
approached
his
host
the
earl
regarded
him
with
amazement
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
hurried
or
agitated
his
dry
keen
old
face
was
actually
pale
i
was
detained
he
said
in
a
low
voice
to
the
earl
by
an
extraordinary
it
was
as
unlike
the
methodic
old
lawyer
to
be
agitated
by
anything
as
it
was
to
be
late
but
it
was
evident
that
he
had
been
disturbed
at
dinner
he
ate
scarcely
anything
and
two
or
three
times
when
he
was
spoken
to
he
started
as
if
his
thoughts
were
far
away
at
dessert
when
fauntleroy
came
in
he
looked
at
him
more
than
once
nervously
and
uneasily
fauntleroy
noted
the
look
and
wondered
at
it
he
and
havisham
were
on
friendly
terms
and
they
usually
exchanged
smiles
the
lawyer
seemed
to
have
forgotten
to
smile
that
evening
the
fact
was
he
forgot
everything
but
the
strange
and
painful
news
he
knew
he
must
tell
the
earl
before
the
night
was
over
the
strange
news
which
he
knew
would
be
so
terrible
a
shock
and
which
would
change
the
face
of
everything
as
he
looked
about
at
the
splendid
rooms
and
the
brilliant
company
at
the
people
gathered
together
he
knew
more
that
they
might
see
the
little
fellow
near
the
earl
chair
than
for
any
other
reason
as
he
looked
at
the
proud
old
man
and
at
little
lord
fauntleroy
smiling
at
his
side
he
really
felt
quite
shaken
notwithstanding
that
he
was
a
hardened
old
lawyer
what
a
blow
it
was
that
he
must
deal
them
he
did
not
exactly
know
how
the
long
superb
dinner
ended
he
sat
through
it
as
if
he
were
in
a
dream
and
several
times
he
saw
the
earl
glance
at
him
in
surprise
but
it
was
over
at
last
and
the
gentlemen
joined
the
ladies
in
the
they
found
fauntleroy
sitting
on
the
sofa
with
miss
vivian
herbert
the
great
beauty
of
the
last
london
season
they
had
been
looking
at
some
pictures
and
he
was
thanking
his
companion
as
the
door
opened
i
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
being
so
kind
to
me
he
was
saying
i
never
was
at
a
party
before
and
i
enjoyed
myself
so
much
he
had
enjoyed
himself
so
much
that
when
the
gentlemen
gathered
about
miss
herbert
again
and
began
to
talk
to
her
as
he
listened
and
tried
to
understand
their
laughing
speeches
his
eyelids
began
to
droop
they
drooped
until
they
covered
his
eyes
two
or
three
times
and
then
the
sound
of
miss
herbert
low
pretty
laugh
would
bring
him
back
and
he
would
open
them
again
for
about
two
seconds
he
was
quite
sure
he
was
not
going
to
sleep
but
there
was
a
large
yellow
satin
cushion
behind
him
and
his
head
sank
against
it
and
after
a
while
his
eyelids
drooped
for
the
last
time
they
did
not
even
quite
open
when
as
it
seemed
a
long
time
after
some
one
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
cheek
it
was
miss
vivian
herbert
who
was
going
away
and
she
spoke
to
him
softly
little
lord
fauntleroy
she
said
sleep
and
in
the
morning
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
tried
to
open
his
eyes
and
had
murmured
sleepily
i
so
glad
i
saw
you
you
are
so
pretty
he
only
had
a
very
faint
recollection
of
hearing
the
gentlemen
laugh
again
and
of
wondering
why
they
did
it
no
sooner
had
the
last
guest
left
the
room
than
havisham
turned
from
his
place
by
the
fire
and
stepped
nearer
the
sofa
where
he
stood
looking
down
at
the
sleeping
occupant
little
lord
fauntleroy
was
taking
his
ease
luxuriously
one
leg
crossed
the
other
and
swung
over
the
edge
of
the
sofa
one
arm
was
flung
easily
above
his
head
the
warm
flush
of
healthful
happy
childish
sleep
was
on
his
quiet
face
his
waving
tangle
of
bright
hair
strayed
over
the
yellow
satin
cushion
he
made
a
picture
well
worth
looking
at
as
havisham
looked
at
it
he
put
his
hand
up
and
rubbed
his
shaven
chin
with
a
harassed
countenance
well
havisham
said
the
earl
harsh
voice
behind
him
what
is
it
it
is
evident
something
has
happened
what
was
the
extraordinary
event
if
i
may
ask
havisham
turned
from
the
sofa
still
rubbing
his
chin
it
was
bad
news
he
answered
distressing
news
my
lord
the
worst
of
news
i
am
sorry
to
be
the
bearer
of
the
earl
had
been
uneasy
for
some
time
during
the
evening
as
he
glanced
at
havisham
and
when
he
was
uneasy
he
was
always
why
do
you
look
so
at
the
boy
he
exclaimed
irritably
you
have
been
looking
at
him
all
the
evening
as
if
see
here
now
why
should
you
look
at
the
boy
havisham
and
hang
over
him
like
some
bird
of
what
has
your
news
to
do
with
lord
fauntleroy
my
lord
said
havisham
i
will
waste
no
words
my
news
has
everything
to
do
with
lord
fauntleroy
and
if
we
are
to
believe
it
it
is
not
lord
fauntleroy
who
lies
sleeping
before
us
but
only
the
son
of
captain
errol
and
the
present
lord
fauntleroy
is
the
son
of
your
son
bevis
and
is
at
this
moment
in
a
in
the
earl
clutched
the
arms
of
his
chair
with
both
his
hands
until
the
veins
stood
out
upon
them
the
veins
stood
out
on
his
forehead
too
his
fierce
old
face
was
almost
livid
what
do
you
mean
he
cried
out
you
are
mad
whose
lie
is
this
if
it
is
a
lie
answered
havisham
it
is
painfully
like
the
truth
a
woman
came
to
my
chambers
this
morning
she
said
your
son
bevis
married
her
six
years
ago
in
london
she
showed
me
her
marriage
certificate
they
quarrelled
a
year
after
the
marriage
and
he
paid
her
to
keep
away
from
him
she
has
a
son
five
years
old
she
is
an
american
of
the
lower
classes
an
ignorant
person
and
until
lately
she
did
not
fully
understand
what
her
son
could
claim
she
consulted
a
lawyer
and
found
out
that
the
boy
was
really
lord
fauntleroy
and
the
heir
to
the
earldom
of
dorincourt
and
she
of
course
insists
on
his
claims
being
there
was
a
movement
of
the
curly
head
on
the
yellow
satin
cushion
a
soft
long
sleepy
sigh
came
from
the
parted
lips
and
the
little
boy
stirred
in
his
sleep
but
not
at
all
restlessly
or
uneasily
not
at
all
as
if
his
slumber
were
disturbed
by
the
fact
that
he
was
being
proved
a
small
impostor
and
that
he
was
not
lord
fauntleroy
at
all
and
never
would
be
the
earl
of
dorincourt
he
only
turned
his
rosy
face
more
on
its
side
as
if
to
enable
the
old
man
who
stared
at
it
so
solemnly
to
see
it
better
the
handsome
grim
old
face
was
ghastly
a
bitter
smile
fixed
itself
upon
it
i
should
refuse
to
believe
a
word
of
it
he
said
if
it
were
not
such
a
low
scoundrelly
piece
of
business
that
it
becomes
quite
possible
in
connection
with
the
name
of
my
son
bevis
it
is
quite
like
bevis
he
was
always
a
disgrace
to
us
always
a
weak
untruthful
vicious
young
brute
with
low
tastes
my
son
and
heir
bevis
lord
fauntleroy
the
woman
is
an
ignorant
vulgar
person
you
say
i
am
obliged
to
admit
that
she
can
scarcely
spell
her
own
name
answered
the
lawyer
she
is
absolutely
uneducated
and
openly
mercenary
she
cares
for
nothing
but
the
money
she
is
very
handsome
in
a
coarse
way
but
the
fastidious
old
lawyer
ceased
speaking
and
gave
a
sort
of
shudder
the
veins
on
the
old
earl
forehead
stood
out
like
purple
cords
something
else
stood
out
upon
it
too
cold
drops
of
moisture
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
swept
them
away
his
smile
grew
even
more
bitter
and
i
he
said
i
objected
to
to
the
other
woman
the
mother
of
this
child
pointing
to
the
sleeping
form
on
the
sofa
i
refused
to
recognize
her
and
yet
she
could
spell
her
own
name
i
suppose
this
is
suddenly
he
sprang
up
from
his
chair
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
fierce
and
terrible
words
poured
forth
from
his
lips
his
rage
and
hatred
and
cruel
disappointment
shook
him
as
a
storm
shakes
a
tree
his
violence
was
something
dreadful
to
see
and
yet
havisham
noticed
that
at
the
very
worst
of
his
wrath
he
never
seemed
to
forget
the
little
sleeping
figure
on
the
yellow
satin
cushion
and
that
he
never
once
spoke
loud
enough
to
awaken
it
i
might
have
known
it
he
said
they
were
a
disgrace
to
me
from
their
first
hour
i
hated
them
both
and
they
hated
me
bevis
was
the
worse
of
the
two
i
will
not
believe
this
yet
though
i
will
contend
against
it
to
the
last
but
it
is
like
bevis
it
is
like
him
and
then
he
raged
again
and
asked
questions
about
the
woman
about
her
proofs
and
pacing
the
room
turned
first
white
and
then
purple
in
his
repressed
fury
when
at
last
he
had
learned
all
there
was
to
be
told
and
knew
the
worst
havisham
looked
at
him
with
a
feeling
of
anxiety
he
looked
broken
and
haggard
and
changed
his
rages
had
always
been
bad
for
him
but
this
one
had
been
worse
than
the
rest
because
there
had
been
something
more
than
rage
in
it
he
came
slowly
back
to
the
sofa
at
last
and
stood
near
it
if
any
one
had
told
me
i
could
be
fond
of
a
child
he
said
his
harsh
voice
low
and
unsteady
i
should
not
have
believed
them
i
always
detested
children
my
own
more
than
the
rest
i
am
fond
of
this
one
he
is
fond
of
me
with
a
bitter
smile
i
am
not
popular
i
never
was
but
he
is
fond
of
me
he
never
was
afraid
of
me
he
always
trusted
me
he
would
have
filled
my
place
better
than
i
have
filled
it
i
know
that
he
would
have
been
an
honor
to
the
he
bent
down
and
stood
a
minute
or
so
looking
at
the
happy
sleeping
face
his
shaggy
eyebrows
were
knitted
fiercely
and
yet
somehow
he
did
not
seem
fierce
at
all
he
put
up
his
hand
pushed
the
bright
hair
back
from
the
forehead
and
then
turned
away
and
rang
the
bell
when
the
largest
footman
appeared
he
pointed
to
the
sofa
take
he
said
and
then
his
voice
changed
a
little
take
lord
fauntleroy
to
his
xi
when
hobbs
young
friend
left
him
to
go
to
dorincourt
castle
and
become
lord
fauntleroy
and
the
had
time
to
realize
that
the
atlantic
ocean
lay
between
himself
and
the
small
companion
who
had
spent
so
many
agreeable
hours
in
his
society
he
really
began
to
feel
very
lonely
indeed
the
fact
was
hobbs
was
not
a
clever
man
nor
even
a
bright
one
he
was
indeed
rather
a
slow
and
heavy
person
and
he
had
never
made
many
acquaintances
he
was
not
mentally
energetic
enough
to
know
how
to
amuse
himself
and
in
truth
he
never
did
anything
of
an
entertaining
nature
but
read
the
newspapers
and
add
up
his
accounts
it
was
not
very
easy
for
him
to
add
up
his
accounts
and
sometimes
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
bring
them
out
right
and
in
the
old
days
little
lord
fauntleroy
who
had
learned
how
to
add
up
quite
nicely
with
his
fingers
and
a
slate
and
pencil
had
sometimes
even
gone
to
the
length
of
trying
to
help
him
and
then
too
he
had
been
so
good
a
listener
and
had
taken
such
an
interest
in
what
the
newspaper
said
and
he
and
hobbs
had
held
such
long
conversations
about
the
revolution
and
the
british
and
the
elections
and
the
republican
party
that
it
was
no
wonder
his
going
left
a
blank
in
the
grocery
store
at
first
it
seemed
to
hobbs
that
cedric
was
not
really
far
away
and
would
come
back
again
that
some
day
he
would
look
up
from
his
paper
and
see
the
little
lad
standing
in
the
in
his
white
suit
and
red
stockings
and
with
his
straw
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
would
hear
him
say
in
his
cheerful
little
voice
hello
hobbs
this
is
a
hot
day
it
but
as
the
days
passed
on
and
this
did
not
happen
hobbs
felt
very
dull
and
uneasy
he
did
not
even
enjoy
his
newspaper
as
much
as
he
used
to
he
would
put
the
paper
down
on
his
knee
after
reading
it
and
sit
and
stare
at
the
high
stool
for
a
long
time
there
were
some
marks
on
the
long
legs
which
made
him
feel
quite
dejected
and
melancholy
they
were
marks
made
by
the
heels
of
the
next
earl
of
dorincourt
when
he
kicked
and
talked
at
the
same
time
it
seems
that
even
youthful
earls
kick
the
legs
of
things
they
sit
on
noble
blood
and
lofty
lineage
do
not
prevent
it
after
looking
at
those
marks
hobbs
would
take
out
his
gold
watch
and
open
it
and
stare
at
the
inscription
from
his
oldest
friend
lord
fauntleroy
to
hobbs
when
this
you
see
remember
and
after
staring
at
it
awhile
he
would
shut
it
up
with
a
loud
snap
and
sigh
and
get
up
and
go
and
stand
in
the
between
the
box
of
potatoes
and
the
barrel
of
apples
and
look
up
the
street
at
night
when
the
store
was
closed
he
would
light
his
pipe
and
walk
slowly
along
the
pavement
until
he
reached
the
house
where
cedric
had
lived
on
which
there
was
a
sign
that
read
this
house
to
let
and
he
would
stop
near
it
and
look
up
and
shake
his
head
and
puff
at
his
pipe
very
hard
and
after
a
while
walk
mournfully
back
again
this
went
on
for
two
or
three
weeks
before
any
new
idea
came
to
him
being
slow
and
ponderous
it
always
took
him
a
long
time
to
reach
a
new
idea
as
a
rule
he
did
not
like
new
ideas
but
preferred
old
ones
after
two
or
three
weeks
however
during
which
instead
of
getting
better
matters
really
grew
worse
a
novel
plan
slowly
and
deliberately
dawned
upon
him
he
would
go
to
see
dick
he
smoked
a
great
many
pipes
before
he
arrived
at
the
conclusion
but
finally
he
did
arrive
at
it
he
would
go
to
see
dick
he
knew
all
about
dick
cedric
had
told
him
and
his
idea
was
that
perhaps
dick
might
be
some
comfort
to
him
in
the
way
of
talking
things
over
so
one
day
when
dick
was
very
hard
at
work
blacking
a
customer
boots
a
short
stout
man
with
a
heavy
face
and
a
bald
head
stopped
on
the
pavement
and
stared
for
two
or
three
minutes
at
the
bootblack
sign
which
read
professor
dick
tipton
ca
be
he
stared
at
it
so
long
that
dick
began
to
take
a
lively
interest
in
him
and
when
he
had
put
the
finishing
touch
to
his
customer
boots
he
said
want
a
shine
sir
the
stout
man
came
forward
deliberately
and
put
his
foot
on
the
rest
yes
he
said
then
when
dick
fell
to
work
the
stout
man
looked
from
dick
to
the
sign
and
from
the
sign
to
dick
where
did
you
get
that
he
asked
from
a
friend
o
mine
said
dick
a
little
feller
he
guv
me
the
whole
outfit
he
was
the
best
little
feller
ye
ever
saw
he
in
england
now
gone
to
be
one
o
them
lord
lord
asked
hobbs
with
ponderous
slowness
lord
fauntleroy
goin
to
be
earl
of
dorincourt
dick
almost
dropped
his
brush
why
boss
he
exclaimed
d
ye
know
him
yerself
i
known
him
answered
hobbs
wiping
his
warm
forehead
ever
since
he
was
born
we
was
lifetime
acquaintances
that
what
we
it
really
made
him
feel
quite
agitated
to
speak
of
it
he
pulled
the
splendid
gold
watch
out
of
his
pocket
and
opened
it
and
showed
the
inside
of
the
case
to
dick
this
you
see
remember
me
he
read
that
was
his
parting
keepsake
to
me
do
want
you
to
forget
me
those
was
his
words
ha
remembered
him
he
went
on
shaking
his
head
if
he
had
given
me
a
thing
an
i
had
seen
hide
nor
hair
on
him
again
he
was
a
companion
as
any
man
would
he
was
the
nicest
little
feller
i
ever
see
said
dick
an
as
to
sand
i
never
seen
so
much
sand
to
a
little
feller
i
thought
a
heap
o
him
i
did
an
we
was
friends
too
we
was
sort
o
chums
from
the
fust
that
little
young
un
an
me
i
grabbed
his
ball
from
under
a
stage
fur
him
an
he
never
forgot
it
an
he
come
down
here
he
would
with
his
mother
or
his
nuss
and
he
holler
dick
at
me
as
friendly
as
if
he
was
six
feet
high
when
he
war
knee
high
to
a
grasshopper
and
was
dressed
in
gal
he
was
a
gay
little
chap
and
when
you
was
down
on
your
luck
it
did
you
good
to
talk
to
that
so
said
hobbs
it
was
a
pity
to
make
a
earl
out
of
him
he
would
have
shone
in
the
grocery
business
or
dry
goods
either
he
would
have
shone
and
he
shook
his
head
with
deeper
regret
than
ever
it
proved
that
they
had
so
much
to
say
to
each
other
that
it
was
not
possible
to
say
it
all
at
one
time
and
so
it
was
agreed
that
the
next
night
dick
should
make
a
visit
to
the
store
and
keep
hobbs
company
the
plan
pleased
dick
well
enough
he
had
been
a
street
waif
nearly
all
his
life
but
he
had
never
been
a
bad
boy
and
he
had
always
had
a
private
yearning
for
a
more
respectable
kind
of
existence
since
he
had
been
in
business
for
himself
he
had
made
enough
money
to
enable
him
to
sleep
under
a
roof
instead
of
out
in
the
streets
and
he
had
begun
to
hope
he
might
reach
even
a
higher
plane
in
time
so
to
be
invited
to
call
on
a
stout
respectable
man
who
owned
a
corner
store
and
even
had
a
horse
and
wagon
seemed
to
him
quite
an
event
do
you
know
anything
about
earls
and
castles
hobbs
inquired
like
to
know
more
of
the
there
a
story
about
some
on
in
the
penny
story
gazette
said
dick
it
called
the
of
a
coronet
or
the
revenge
of
the
countess
may
it
a
boss
thing
too
some
of
us
boys
takin
it
to
bring
it
up
when
you
come
said
hobbs
an
i
pay
for
it
bring
all
you
can
find
that
have
any
earls
in
if
there
are
earls
markises
do
or
dooks
though
he
never
made
mention
of
any
dooks
or
markises
we
did
go
over
coronets
a
little
but
i
never
happened
to
see
any
i
guess
they
do
keep
tiffany
have
if
anybody
did
said
dick
but
i
do
know
as
i
know
one
if
i
saw
hobbs
did
not
explain
that
he
would
not
have
known
one
if
he
saw
it
he
merely
shook
his
head
ponderously
i
there
is
very
little
call
for
he
said
and
that
ended
the
matter
this
was
the
beginning
of
quite
a
substantial
friendship
when
dick
went
up
to
the
store
hobbs
received
him
with
great
hospitality
he
gave
him
a
chair
tilted
against
the
door
near
a
barrel
of
apples
and
after
his
young
visitor
was
seated
he
made
a
jerk
at
them
with
the
hand
in
which
he
held
his
pipe
saying
help
then
he
looked
at
the
story
papers
and
after
that
they
read
and
discussed
the
british
aristocracy
and
hobbs
smoked
his
pipe
very
hard
and
shook
his
head
a
great
deal
he
shook
it
most
when
he
pointed
out
the
high
stool
with
the
marks
on
its
legs
there
his
very
kicks
he
said
impressively
his
very
kicks
i
sit
and
look
at
by
the
hour
this
is
a
world
of
ups
an
it
a
world
of
downs
why
he
set
there
an
eat
crackers
out
of
a
box
an
apples
out
of
a
barrel
an
pitch
his
cores
into
the
street
an
now
he
a
lord
in
a
castle
them
a
lord
kicks
they
be
a
kicks
some
day
sometimes
i
says
to
myself
says
i
i
be
jiggered
he
seemed
to
derive
a
great
deal
of
comfort
from
his
reflections
and
dick
visit
before
dick
went
home
they
had
a
supper
in
the
small
they
had
crackers
and
cheese
and
sardines
and
other
canned
things
out
of
the
store
and
hobbs
solemnly
opened
two
bottles
of
ginger
ale
and
pouring
out
two
glasses
proposed
a
toast
here
to
him
he
said
lifting
his
glass
an
may
he
teach
a
lesson
earls
an
markises
an
dooks
an
all
after
that
night
the
two
saw
each
other
often
and
hobbs
was
much
more
comfortable
and
less
desolate
they
read
the
penny
story
gazette
and
many
other
interesting
things
and
gained
a
knowledge
of
the
habits
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
which
would
have
surprised
those
despised
classes
if
they
had
realized
it
one
day
hobbs
made
a
pilgrimage
to
a
book
store
down
town
for
the
express
purpose
of
adding
to
their
library
he
went
to
the
clerk
and
leaned
over
the
counter
to
speak
to
him
i
want
he
said
a
book
about
what
exclaimed
the
clerk
a
book
repeated
the
about
i
afraid
said
the
clerk
looking
rather
queer
that
we
what
you
have
said
hobbs
anxiously
well
say
markises
then
or
i
know
of
no
such
book
answered
the
clerk
hobbs
was
much
disturbed
he
looked
down
on
the
floor
then
he
looked
up
none
about
female
earls
he
inquired
i
afraid
not
said
the
clerk
with
a
smile
well
exclaimed
hobbs
i
be
jiggered
he
was
just
going
out
of
the
store
when
the
clerk
called
him
back
and
asked
him
if
a
story
in
which
the
nobility
were
chief
characters
would
do
hobbs
said
it
would
if
he
could
not
get
an
entire
volume
devoted
to
earls
so
the
clerk
sold
him
a
book
called
the
tower
of
london
written
by
harrison
ainsworth
and
he
carried
it
home
when
dick
came
they
began
to
read
it
it
was
a
very
wonderful
and
exciting
book
and
the
scene
was
laid
in
the
reign
of
the
famous
english
queen
who
is
called
by
some
people
bloody
mary
and
as
hobbs
heard
of
queen
mary
deeds
and
the
habit
she
had
of
chopping
people
heads
off
putting
them
to
the
torture
and
burning
them
alive
he
became
very
much
excited
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
stared
at
dick
and
at
last
he
was
obliged
to
mop
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
with
his
red
pocket
handkerchief
why
he
ai
safe
he
said
he
ai
safe
if
the
women
folks
can
sit
up
on
their
thrones
an
give
the
word
for
things
like
that
to
be
done
who
to
know
what
happening
to
him
this
very
minute
he
no
more
safe
than
nothing
just
let
a
woman
like
that
get
mad
an
no
safe
well
said
dick
though
he
looked
rather
anxious
himself
ye
see
this
un
is
the
one
that
bossin
things
now
i
know
her
victory
an
this
un
here
in
the
book
her
name
so
it
is
said
hobbs
still
mopping
his
forehead
so
it
is
the
newspapers
are
not
sayin
anything
about
any
racks
or
but
still
it
does
seem
as
if
was
safe
for
him
over
there
with
those
queer
folks
why
they
tell
me
they
do
keep
the
fourth
o
july
he
was
privately
uneasy
for
several
days
and
it
was
not
until
he
received
fauntleroy
letter
and
had
read
it
several
times
both
to
himself
and
to
dick
and
had
also
read
the
letter
dick
got
about
the
same
time
that
he
became
composed
again
but
they
both
found
great
pleasure
in
their
letters
they
read
and
them
and
talked
them
over
and
enjoyed
every
word
of
them
and
they
spent
days
over
the
answers
they
sent
and
read
them
over
almost
as
often
as
the
letters
they
had
received
it
was
rather
a
labor
for
dick
to
write
his
all
his
knowledge
of
reading
and
writing
he
had
gained
during
a
few
months
when
he
had
lived
with
his
elder
brother
and
had
gone
to
a
but
being
a
sharp
boy
he
had
made
the
most
of
that
brief
education
and
had
spelled
out
things
in
newspapers
since
then
and
practiced
writing
with
bits
of
chalk
on
pavements
or
walls
or
fences
he
told
hobbs
all
about
his
life
and
about
his
elder
brother
who
had
been
rather
good
to
him
after
their
mother
died
when
dick
was
quite
a
little
fellow
their
father
had
died
some
time
before
the
brother
name
was
ben
and
he
had
taken
care
of
dick
as
well
as
he
could
until
the
boy
was
old
enough
to
sell
newspapers
and
run
errands
they
had
lived
together
and
as
he
grew
older
ben
had
managed
to
get
along
until
he
had
quite
a
decent
place
in
a
store
and
then
exclaimed
dick
with
disgust
blest
if
he
did
go
marry
a
gal

going
out
west

written
once
or
twice
to
dick
ben
luck

he
had
wandered
from

to
place
but
at
last
he
had
settled
on
a
ranch
in
california
where
he
was
at
work
at
the
time
when
dick
became
acquainted
with
hobbs
that
gal
said
dick
one
day
she
took
all
the
grit
out
o
him
i
could
help
feelin
sorry
for
him
they
were
sitting
in
the
store
together
and
hobbs
was
filling
his
pipe
he
ought
to
married
he
said
solemnly
as
he
rose
to
get
a
match
women
i
never
could
see
any
use
in
as
he
took
the
match
from
its
box
he
stopped
and
looked
down
on
the
counter
why
he
said
if
here
is
a
letter
i
did
see
it
before
the
postman
must
have
laid
it
down
when
i
was
noticin
or
the
newspaper
slipped
over
he
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
it
carefully
it
from
him
he
exclaimed
that
the
very
one
it
from
he
forgot
his
pipe
altogether
he
went
back
to
his
chair
quite
excited
and
took
his
and
opened
the
envelope
i
wonder
what
news
there
is
this
time
he
said
and
then
he
unfolded
the
letter
and
read
as

dearest
i
have
been
asking
wilkins
about
grooming
horses
preaps
i
might
be
a
groom
or
a
coachman
the
lady
brought
her
little
boy
to
the
castle
and
my
grandfarther
and
havisham
talked
to
her
i
think
she
was
angry
she
talked
loud
and
my
grandfarther
was
angry
too
i
never
saw
him
angry
before
i
wish
it
did
not
make
them
all
mad
i
thort
i
would
tell
you
and
dick
right
away
becaus
you
would
be
intrusted
so
no
more
at
present
with
love
from
your
old
frend
cedric
errol
not
lord
fauntleroy
hobbs
fell
back
in
his
chair
the
letter
dropped
on
his
knee
his
slipped
to
the
floor
and
so
did
the
envelope
well
he
ejaculated
i
am
jiggered
he
was
so
dumfounded
that
he
actually
changed
his
exclamation
it
had
always
been
his
habit
to
say
i
will
be
jiggered
but
this
time
he
said
i
am
perhaps
he
really
was
jiggered
there
is
no
knowing
well
said
dick
the
whole
thing
bust
up
has
it
bust
said
hobbs
it
my
opinion
it
a
job
o
the
british
ristycrats
to
rob
him
of
his
rights
because
he
an
american
they
had
a
spite
agin
us
ever
since
the
revolution
an
takin
it
out
on
him
i
told
you
he
was
safe
an
see
happened
like
as
not
the
whole
got
together
to
rob
him
of
his
lawful
he
was
very
much
agitated
he
had
not
approved
of
the
change
in
his
young
friend
circumstances
at
first
but
lately
he
had
become
more
reconciled
to
it
and
after
the
receipt
of
cedric
letter
he
had
perhaps
even
felt
some
secret
pride
in
his
young
friend
magnificence
he
might
not
have
a
good
opinion
of
earls
but
he
knew
that
even
in
america
money
was
considered
rather
an
agreeable
thing
and
if
all
the
wealth
and
grandeur
were
to
go
with
the
title
it
must
be
rather
hard
to
lose
it
they
trying
to
rob
him
he
said
that
what
they
doing
and
folks
that
have
money
ought
to
look
after
and
he
kept
dick
with
him
until
quite
a
late
hour
to
talk
it
over
and
when
that
young
man
left
he
went
with
him
to
the
corner
of
the
street
and
on
his
way
back
he
stopped
opposite
the
empty
house
for
some
time
staring
at
the
to
let
and
smoking
his
pipe
in
much
disturbance
of
mind
xii
a
very
few
days
after
the
dinner
party
at
the
castle
almost
everybody
in
england
who
read
the
newspapers
at
all
knew
the
romantic
story
of
what
had
happened
at
dorincourt
it
made
a
very
interesting
story
when
it
was
told
with
all
the
details
there
was
the
little
american
boy
who
had
been
brought
to
england
to
be
lord
fauntleroy
and
who
was
said
to
be
so
fine
and
handsome
a
little
fellow
and
to
have
already
made
people
fond
of
him
there
was
the
old
earl
his
grandfather
who
was
so
proud
of
his
heir
there
was
the
pretty
young
mother
who
had
never
been
forgiven
for
marrying
captain
errol
and
there
was
the
strange
marriage
of
bevis
the
dead
lord
fauntleroy
and
the
strange
wife
of
whom
no
one
knew
anything
suddenly
appearing
with
her
son
and
saying
that
he
was
the
real
lord
fauntleroy
and
must
have
his
rights
all
these
things
were
talked
about
and
written
about
and
caused
a
tremendous
sensation
and
then
there
came
the
rumor
that
the
earl
of
dorincourt
was
not
satisfied
with
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
and
would
perhaps
contest
the
claim
by
law
and
the
matter
might
end
with
a
wonderful
trial
there
never
had
been
such
excitement
before
in
the
county
in
which
erleboro
was
situated
on
people
stood
in
groups
and
talked
and
wondered
what
would
be
done
the
farmers
wives
invited
one
another
to
tea
that
they
might
tell
one
another
all
they
had
heard
and
all
they
thought
and
all
they
thought
other
people
thought
they
related
wonderful
anecdotes
about
the
earl
rage
and
his
determination
not
to
acknowledge
the
new
lord
fauntleroy
and
his
hatred
of
the
woman
who
was
the
claimant
mother
but
of
course
it
was
dibble
who
could
tell
the
most
and
who
was
more
in
demand
than
ever
an
a
bad
lookout
it
is
she
said
an
if
you
were
to
ask
me
i
should
say
as
it
was
a
judgment
on
him
for
the
way
he
treated
that
sweet
young
as
he
parted
from
her
child
for
he
got
that
fond
of
him
an
that
set
on
him
an
that
proud
of
him
as
he
drove
mad
by
what
happened
an
what
more
this
new
one
no
lady
as
his
little
lordship
ma
is
she
a
thing
as
thomas
says
no
gentleman
in
livery
bemean
hisself
to
be
gave
orders
by
and
let
her
come
into
the
house
he
says
an
he
goes
out
of
it
an
the
boy
do
no
more
compare
with
the
other
one
than
you
could
mention
an
mercy
knows
what
goin
to
come
of
it
all
where
it
to
end
an
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
when
jane
brought
the
in
fact
there
was
excitement
everywhere
at
the
castle
in
the
library
where
the
earl
and
havisham
sat
and
talked
in
the
servants
hall
where
thomas
and
the
butler
and
the
other
men
and
women
servants
gossiped
and
exclaimed
at
all
times
of
the
day
and
in
the
stables
where
wilkins
went
about
his
work
in
a
quite
depressed
state
of
mind
and
groomed
the
brown
pony
more
beautifully
than
ever
and
said
mournfully
to
the
coachman
that
he
never
taught
a
young
to
ride
as
took
to
it
more
or
was
a
one
than
he
was
he
was
a
one
as
it
were
some
pleasure
to
ride
but
in
the
midst
of
all
the
disturbance
there
was
one
person
who
was
quite
calm
and
untroubled
that
person
was
the
little
lord
fauntleroy
who
was
said
not
to
be
lord
fauntleroy
at
all
when
first
the
state
of
affairs
had
been
explained
to
him
he
had
felt
some
little
anxiousness
and
perplexity
it
is
true
but
its
foundation
was
not
in
baffled
ambition
while
the
earl
told
him
what
had
happened
he
had
sat
on
a
stool
holding
on
to
his
knee
as
he
so
often
did
when
he
was
listening
to
anything
interesting
and
by
the
time
the
story
was
finished
he
looked
quite
sober
it
makes
me
feel
very
queer
he
said
it
makes
me
feel
queer
the
earl
looked
at
the
boy
in
silence
it
made
him
feel
queer
too
queerer
than
he
had
ever
felt
in
his
whole
life
and
he
felt
more
queer
still
when
he
saw
that
there
was
a
troubled
expression
on
the
small
face
which
was
usually
so
happy
will
they
take
dearest
house
from
her
and
her
carriage
cedric
asked
in
a
rather
unsteady
anxious
little
voice
no
said
the
earl
decidedly
in
quite
a
loud
voice
in
fact
they
can
take
nothing
from
ah
said
cedric
with
evident
relief
ca
they
then
he
looked
up
at
his
grandfather
and
there
was
a
wistful
shade
in
his
eyes
and
they
looked
very
big
and
soft
that
other
boy
he
said
rather
tremulously
he
will
have
to
to
be
your
boy
now
as
i
was
wo
he
no
answered
the
earl
and
he
said
it
so
fiercely
and
loudly
that
cedric
quite
jumped
no
he
exclaimed
in
wonderment
wo
he
i
thought
he
stood
up
from
his
stool
quite
suddenly
shall
i
be
your
boy
even
if
i
not
going
to
be
an
earl
he
said
shall
i
be
your
boy
just
as
i
was
before
and
his
flushed
little
face
was
all
alight
with
eagerness
how
the
old
earl
did
look
at
him
from
head
to
foot
to
be
sure
how
his
great
shaggy
brows
did
draw
themselves
together
and
how
queerly
his
deep
eyes
shone
under
them
how
very
queerly
my
boy
he
said
and
if
you
believe
it
his
very
voice
was
queer
almost
shaky
and
a
little
broken
and
hoarse
not
at
all
what
you
would
expect
an
earl
voice
to
be
though
he
spoke
more
decidedly
and
peremptorily
even
than
before
yes
you
be
my
boy
as
long
as
i
live
and
by
george
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
you
were
the
only
boy
i
had
ever
cedric
face
turned
red
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
it
turned
red
with
relief
and
pleasure
he
put
both
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
and
looked
squarely
into
his
noble
relative
eyes
do
you
he
said
well
then
i
do
care
about
the
earl
part
at
all
i
do
care
whether
i
an
earl
or
not
i
thought
you
see
i
thought
the
one
that
was
going
to
be
the
earl
would
have
to
be
your
boy
too
and
and
i
could
be
that
was
what
made
me
feel
so
the
earl
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
drew
him
nearer
they
shall
take
nothing
from
you
that
i
can
hold
for
you
he
said
drawing
his
breath
hard
i
wo
believe
yet
that
they
can
take
anything
from
you
you
were
made
for
the
place
and
well
you
may
fill
it
still
but
whatever
comes
you
shall
have
all
that
i
can
give
you
all
it
scarcely
seemed
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
a
child
there
was
such
determination
in
his
face
and
voice
it
was
more
as
if
he
were
making
a
promise
to
himself
and
perhaps
he
was
he
had
never
before
known
how
deep
a
hold
upon
him
his
fondness
for
the
boy
and
his
pride
in
him
had
taken
he
had
never
seen
his
strength
and
good
qualities
and
beauty
as
he
seemed
to
see
them
now
to
his
obstinate
nature
it
seemed
impossible
more
than
impossible
to
give
up
what
he
had
so
set
his
heart
upon
and
he
had
determined
that
he
would
not
give
it
up
without
a
fierce
struggle
within
a
few
days
after
she
had
seen
havisham
the
woman
who
claimed
to
be
lady
fauntleroy
presented
herself
at
the
castle
and
brought
her
child
with
her
she
was
sent
away
the
earl
would
not
see
her
she
was
told
by
the
footman
at
the
door
his
lawyer
would
attend
to
her
case
it
was
thomas
who
gave
the
message
and
who
expressed
his
opinion
of
her
freely
afterward
in
the
servants
hall
he
hoped
he
said
as
he
had
wore
livery
in
famblies
long
enough
to
know
a
lady
when
he
see
one
an
if
that
was
a
lady
he
was
no
judge
o
the
one
at
the
lodge
added
thomas
loftily
or
no
she
one
o
the
right
sort
as
any
gentleman
reckinize
with
all
a
heye
i
remarked
it
myself
to
henery
when
fust
we
called
the
woman
drove
away
the
look
on
her
handsome
common
face
half
frightened
half
fierce
havisham
had
noticed
during
his
interviews
with
her
that
though
she
had
a
passionate
temper
and
a
coarse
insolent
manner
she
was
neither
so
clever
nor
so
bold
as
she
meant
to
be
she
seemed
sometimes
to
be
almost
overwhelmed
by
the
position
in
which
she
had
placed
herself
it
was
as
if
she
had
not
expected
to
meet
with
such
opposition
she
is
evidently
the
lawyer
said
to
errol
a
person
from
the
lower
walks
of
life
she
is
uneducated
and
untrained
in
everything
and
quite
unused
to
meeting
people
like
ourselves
on
any
terms
of
equality
she
does
not
know
what
to
do
her
visit
to
the
castle
quite
cowed
her
she
was
infuriated
but
she
was
cowed
the
earl
would
not
receive
her
but
i
advised
him
to
go
with
me
to
the
dorincourt
arms
where
she
is
staying
when
she
saw
him
enter
the
room
she
turned
white
though
she
flew
into
a
rage
at
once
and
threatened
and
demanded
in
one
the
fact
was
that
the
earl
had
stalked
into
the
room
and
stood
looking
like
a
venerable
aristocratic
giant
staring
at
the
woman
from
under
his
beetling
brows
and
not
condescending
a
word
he
simply
stared
at
her
taking
her
in
from
head
to
foot
as
if
she
were
some
repulsive
curiosity
he
let
her
talk
and
demand
until
she
was
tired
without
himself
uttering
a
word
and
then
he
said
you
say
you
are
my
eldest
son
wife
if
that
is
true
and
if
the
proof
you
offer
is
too
much
for
us
the
law
is
on
your
side
in
that
case
your
boy
is
lord
fauntleroy
the
matter
will
be
sifted
to
the
bottom
you
may
rest
assured
if
your
claims
are
proved
you
will
be
provided
for
i
want
to
see
nothing
of
either
you
or
the
child
so
long
as
i
live
the
place
will
unfortunately
have
enough
of
you
after
my
death
you
are
exactly
the
kind
of
person
i
should
have
expected
my
son
bevis
to
and
then
he
turned
his
back
upon
her
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
as
he
had
stalked
into
it
not
many
days
after
that
a
visitor
was
announced
to
errol
who
was
writing
in
her
little
morning
room
the
maid
who
brought
the
message
looked
rather
excited
her
eyes
were
quite
round
with
amazement
in
fact
and
being
young
and
inexperienced
she
regarded
her
mistress
with
nervous
sympathy
it
the
earl
hisself
she
said
in
tremulous
awe
when
errol
entered
the
a
very
tall
old
man
was
standing
on
the
rug
he
had
a
handsome
grim
old
face
with
an
aquiline
profile
a
long
white
mustache
and
an
obstinate
look
mrs
errol
i
believe
he
said
mrs
errol
she
answered
i
am
the
earl
of
dorincourt
he
said
he
paused
a
moment
almost
unconsciously
to
look
into
her
uplifted
eyes
they
were
so
like
the
big
affectionate
childish
eyes
he
had
seen
uplifted
to
his
own
so
often
every
day
during
the
last
few
months
that
they
gave
him
a
quite
curious
sensation
the
boy
is
very
like
you
he
said
abruptly
it
has
been
often
said
so
my
lord
she
replied
but
i
have
been
glad
to
think
him
like
his
father
as
lady
lorridaile
had
told
him
her
voice
was
very
sweet
and
her
manner
was
very
simple
and
dignified
she
did
not
seem
in
the
least
troubled
by
his
sudden
coming
yes
said
the
earl
he
is
like
my
son
he
put
his
hand
up
to
his
big
white
mustache
and
pulled
it
fiercely
do
you
know
he
said
why
i
have
come
here
i
have
seen
havisham
errol
began
and
he
has
told
me
of
the
claims
which
have
been
made
i
have
come
to
tell
you
said
the
earl
that
they
will
be
investigated
and
contested
if
a
contest
can
be
made
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
the
boy
shall
be
defended
with
all
the
power
of
the
law
his
rights
the
soft
voice
interrupted
him
he
must
have
nothing
that
is
not
his
by
right
even
if
the
law
can
give
it
to
him
she
said
unfortunately
the
law
can
not
said
the
earl
if
it
could
it
should
this
outrageous
woman
and
her
child
perhaps
she
cares
for
him
as
much
as
i
care
for
cedric
my
lord
said
little
errol
and
if
she
was
your
eldest
son
wife
her
son
is
lord
fauntleroy
and
mine
is
she
was
no
more
afraid
of
him
than
cedric
had
been
and
she
looked
at
him
just
as
cedric
would
have
looked
and
he
having
been
an
old
tyrant
all
his
life
was
privately
pleased
by
it
people
so
seldom
dared
to
differ
from
him
that
there
was
an
entertaining
novelty
in
it
i
suppose
he
said
scowling
slightly
that
you
would
much
prefer
that
he
should
not
be
the
earl
of
her
fair
young
face
flushed
it
is
a
very
magnificent
thing
to
be
the
earl
of
dorincourt
my
lord
she
said
i
know
that
but
i
care
most
that
he
should
be
what
his
father
was
brave
and
just
and
true
in
striking
contrast
to
what
his
grandfather
was
eh
said
his
lordship
sardonically
i
have
not
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
his
grandfather
replied
errol
but
i
know
my
little
boy
believes
she
stopped
short
a
moment
looking
quietly
into
his
face
and
then
she
added
i
know
that
cedric
loves
would
he
have
loved
me
said
the
earl
dryly
if
you
had
told
him
why
i
did
not
receive
you
at
the
castle
no
answered
errol
i
think
not
that
was
why
i
did
not
wish
him
to
well
said
my
lord
brusquely
there
are
few
women
who
would
not
have
told
he
suddenly
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
pulling
his
great
mustache
more
violently
than
ever
yes
he
is
fond
of
me
he
said
and
i
am
fond
of
him
i
ca
say
i
ever
was
fond
of
anything
before
i
am
fond
of
him
he
pleased
me
from
the
first
i
am
an
old
man
and
was
tired
of
my
life
he
has
given
me
something
to
live
for
i
am
proud
of
him
i
was
satisfied
to
think
of
his
taking
his
place
some
day
as
the
head
of
the
he
came
back
and
stood
before
errol
i
am
miserable
he
said
miserable
he
looked
as
if
he
was
even
his
pride
could
not
keep
his
voice
steady
or
his
hands
from
shaking
for
a
moment
it
almost
seemed
as
if
his
deep
fierce
eyes
had
tears
in
them
perhaps
it
is
because
i
am
miserable
that
i
have
come
to
you
he
said
quite
glaring
down
at
her
i
used
to
hate
you
i
have
been
jealous
of
you
this
wretched
disgraceful
business
has
changed
that
after
seeing
that
repulsive
woman
who
calls
herself
the
wife
of
my
son
bevis
i
actually
felt
it
would
be
a
relief
to
look
at
you
i
have
been
an
obstinate
old
fool
and
i
suppose
i
have
treated
you
badly
you
are
like
the
boy
and
the
boy
is
the
first
object
in
my
life
i
am
miserable
and
i
came
to
you
merely
because
you
are
like
the
boy
and
he
cares
for
you
and
i
care
for
him
treat
me
as
well
as
you
can
for
the
boy
he
said
it
all
in
his
harsh
voice
and
almost
roughly
but
somehow
he
seemed
so
broken
down
for
the
time
that
errol
was
touched
to
the
heart
she
got
up
and
moved
an
a
little
forward
i
wish
you
would
sit
down
she
said
in
a
soft
pretty
sympathetic
way
you
have
been
so
much
troubled
that
you
are
very
tired
and
you
need
all
your
it
was
just
as
new
to
him
to
be
spoken
to
and
cared
for
in
that
gentle
simple
way
as
it
was
to
be
contradicted
he
was
reminded
of
the
boy
again
and
he
actually
did
as
she
asked
him
perhaps
his
disappointment
and
wretchedness
were
good
discipline
for
him
if
he
had
not
been
wretched
he
might
have
continued
to
hate
her
but
just
at
present
he
found
her
a
little
soothing
almost
anything
would
have
seemed
pleasant
by
contrast
with
lady
fauntleroy
and
this
one
had
so
sweet
a
face
and
voice
and
a
pretty
dignity
when
she
spoke
or
moved
very
soon
through
the
quiet
magic
of
these
influences
he
began
to
feel
less
gloomy
and
then
he
talked
still
more
whatever
happens
he
said
the
boy
shall
be
provided
for
he
shall
be
taken
care
of
now
and
in
the
before
he
went
away
he
glanced
around
the
room
do
you
like
the
house
he
demanded
very
much
she
answered
this
is
a
cheerful
room
he
said
may
i
come
here
again
and
talk
this
matter
over
as
often
as
you
wish
my
lord
she
replied
and
then
he
went
out
to
his
carriage
and
drove
away
thomas
and
henry
almost
stricken
dumb
upon
the
box
at
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
xiii
of
course
as
soon
as
the
story
of
lord
fauntleroy
and
the
difficulties
of
the
earl
of
dorincourt
were
discussed
in
the
english
newspapers
they
were
discussed
in
the
american
newspapers
the
story
was
too
interesting
to
be
passed
over
lightly
and
it
was
talked
of
a
great
deal
there
were
so
many
versions
of
it
that
it
would
have
been
an
edifying
thing
to
buy
all
the
papers
and
compare
them
hobbs
read
so
much
about
it
that
he
became
quite
bewildered
one
paper
described
his
young
friend
cedric
as
an
infant
in
arms
another
as
a
young
man
at
oxford
winning
all
the
honors
and
distinguishing
himself
by
writing
greek
poems
one
said
he
was
engaged
to
a
young
lady
of
great
beauty
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
duke
another
said
he
had
just
been
married
the
only
thing
in
fact
which
was
not
said
was
that
he
was
a
little
boy
between
seven
and
eight
with
handsome
legs
and
curly
hair
one
said
he
was
no
relation
to
the
earl
of
dorincourt
at
all
but
was
a
small
impostor
who
had
sold
newspapers
and
slept
in
the
streets
of
new
york
before
his
mother
imposed
upon
the
family
lawyer
who
came
to
america
to
look
for
the
earl
heir
then
came
the
descriptions
of
the
new
lord
fauntleroy
and
his
mother
sometimes
she
was
a
gypsy
sometimes
an
actress
sometimes
a
beautiful
spaniard
but
it
was
always
agreed
that
the
earl
of
dorincourt
was
her
deadly
enemy
and
would
not
acknowledge
her
son
as
his
heir
if
he
could
help
it
and
as
there
seemed
to
be
some
slight
flaw
in
the
papers
she
had
produced
it
was
expected
that
there
would
be
a
long
trial
which
would
be
far
more
interesting
than
anything
ever
carried
into
court
before
hobbs
used
to
read
the
papers
until
his
head
was
in
a
whirl
and
in
the
evening
he
and
dick
would
talk
it
all
over
they
found
out
what
an
important
personage
an
earl
of
dorincourt
was
and
what
a
magnificent
income
he
possessed
and
how
many
estates
he
owned
and
how
stately
and
beautiful
was
the
castle
in
which
he
lived
and
the
more
they
learned
the
more
excited
they
became
seems
like
somethin
orter
be
done
said
hobbs
things
like
them
orter
be
held
on
to
earls
or
no
but
there
really
was
nothing
they
could
do
but
each
write
a
letter
to
cedric
containing
assurances
of
their
friendship
and
sympathy
they
wrote
those
letters
as
soon
as
they
could
after
receiving
the
news
and
after
having
written
them
they
handed
them
over
to
each
other
to
be
read
this
is
what
hobbs
read
in
dick
letter
dere

truly
silas
well
said
hobbs
he
pervided
for
between
us
if
he
aint
a
so
he
is
said
dick
i
ha
stood
by
him
blest
if
i
did
like
that
little
feller
the
very
next
morning
one
of
dick
customers
was
rather
surprised
he
was
a
young
lawyer
just
beginning
practice
as
poor
as
a
very
young
lawyer
can
possibly
be
but
a
bright
energetic
young
fellow
with
sharp
wit
and
a
good
temper
he
had
a
shabby
office
near
dick
stand
and
every
morning
dick
blacked
his
boots
for
him
and
quite
often
they
were
not
exactly
but
he
always
had
a
friendly
word
or
a
joke
for
dick
that
particular
morning
when
he
put
his
foot
on
the
rest
he
had
an
illustrated
paper
in
his
hand
an
enterprising
paper
with
pictures
in
it
of
conspicuous
people
and
things
he
had
just
finished
looking
it
over
and
when
the
last
boot
was
polished
he
handed
it
over
to
the
boy
here
a
paper
for
you
dick
he
said
you
can
look
it
over
when
you
drop
in
at
delmonico
for
your
breakfast
picture
of
an
english
castle
in
it
and
an
english
earl
fine
young
woman
too
lots
of
hair
though
she
seems
to
be
raising
rather
a
row
you
ought
to
become
familiar
with
the
nobility
and
gentry
dick
begin
on
the
right
honorable
the
earl
of
dorincourt
and
lady
fauntleroy
hello
i
say
what
the
matter
the
pictures
he
spoke
of
were
on
the
front
page
and
dick
was
staring
at
one
of
them
with
his
eyes
and
mouth
open
and
his
sharp
face
almost
pale
with
excitement
what
to
pay
dick
said
the
young
man
what
has
paralyzed
you
dick
really
did
look
as
if
something
tremendous
had
happened
he
pointed
to
the
picture
under
which
was
written
mother
of
claimant
lady
fauntleroy
it
was
the
picture
of
a
handsome
woman
with
large
eyes
and
heavy
braids
of
black
hair
wound
around
her
head
her
said
dick
my
i
know
her
better
i
know
you
the
young
man
began
to
laugh
where
did
you
meet
her
dick
he
said
at
newport
or
when
you
ran
over
to
paris
the
last
time
dick
actually
forgot
to
grin
he
began
to
gather
his
brushes
and
things
together
as
if
he
had
something
to
do
which
would
put
an
end
to
his
business
for
the
present
never
mind
he
said
i
know
her
an
i
struck
work
for
this
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
from
that
time
he
was
tearing
through
the
streets
on
his
way
to
hobbs
and
the
corner
store
hobbs
could
scarcely
believe
the
evidence
of
his
senses
when
he
looked
across
the
counter
and
saw
dick
rush
in
with
the
paper
in
his
hand
the
boy
was
out
of
breath
with
running
so
much
out
of
breath
in
fact
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
as
he
threw
the
paper
down
on
the
counter
hello
exclaimed
hobbs
hello
what
you
got
there
look
at
it
panted
dick
look
at
that
woman
in
the
picture

withering
scorn

his
seat

job

said

knowed
it
and
they
done
it
on
account
o
him
bein
a

cried
dick
with
disgust
she
done
it
that
who
done
it
she
was
allers
up
to
her
tricks
an
i
tell
yer
wot
come
to
me
the
minnit
i
saw
her
pictur
there
was
one
o
them
papers
we
saw
had
a
letter
in
it
that
said
somethin
her
boy
an
it
said
he
had
a
scar
on
his
chin

them
two
together
her
that
there
scar
why
that
there
boy
o
hers
aint
no
more
a
lord
than
i
am
it
boy
the
little
chap
she
hit
when
she
let
fly
that
plate
at
professor
dick
tipton
had
always
been
a
sharp
boy
and
earning
his
living
in
the
streets
of
a
big
city
had
made
him
still
sharper
he
had
learned
to
keep
his
eyes
open
and
his
wits
about
him
and
it
must
be
confessed
he
enjoyed
immensely
the
excitement
and
impatience
of
that
moment
if
little
lord
fauntleroy
could
only
have
looked
into
the
store
that
morning
he
would
certainly
have
been
interested
even
if
all
the
discussion
and
plans
had
been
intended
to
decide
the
fate
of
some
other
boy
than
himself
hobbs
was
almost
overwhelmed
by
his
sense
of
responsibility
and
dick
was
all
alive
and
full
of
energy
he
began
to
write
a
letter
to
ben
and
he
cut
out
the
picture
and
inclosed
it
to
him
and
hobbs
wrote
a
letter
to
cedric
and
one
to
the
earl
they
were
in
the
midst
of
this
when
a
new
idea
came
to
dick
say
he
said
the
feller
that
give
me
the
paper
he
a
lawyer
ax
him
what
we
better
do
lawyers
knows
it
hobbs
was
immensely
impressed
by
this
suggestion
and
dick
business
capacity
that
so
he
replied
this
here
calls
for
and
leaving
the
store
in
the
care
of
a
substitute
he
struggled
into
his
coat
and
marched
with
dick
and
the
two
presented
themselves
with
their
romantic
story
in
harrison
office
much
to
that
young
man
astonishment
if
he
had
not
been
a
very
young
lawyer
with
a
very
enterprising
mind
and
a
great
deal
of
spare
time
on
his
hands
he
might
not
have
been
so
readily
interested
in
what
they
had
to
say
for
it
all
certainly
sounded
very
wild
and
queer
but
he
chanced
to
want
something
to
do
very
much
and
he
chanced
to
know
dick
and
dick
chanced
to
say
his
say
in
a
very
sharp
telling
sort
of
way
and
said
hobbs
say
what
your
time
worth
a
hour
and
look
into
this
thing
thorough
and
i
pay
the
damage
silas
hobbs
corner
of
blank
street
vegetables
and
fancy
well
said
harrison
it
will
be
a
big
thing
if
it
turns
out
all
right
and
it
will
be
almost
as
big
a
thing
for
me
as
for
lord
fauntleroy
and
at
any
rate
no
harm
can
be
done
by
investigating
it
appears
there
has
been
some
dubiousness
about
the
child
the
woman
contradicted
herself
in
some
of
her
statements
about
his
age
and
aroused
suspicion
the
first
persons
to
be
written
to
are
dick
brother
and
the
earl
of
dorincourt
family
and
actually
before
the
sun
went
down
two
letters
had
been
written
and
sent
in
two
different
directions
one
speeding
out
of
new
york
harbor
on
a
mail
steamer
on
its
way
to
england
and
the
other
on
a
train
carrying
letters
and
passengers
bound
for
california
and
the
first
was
addressed
to
havisham
and
the
second
to
benjamin
tipton
and
after
the
store
was
closed
that
evening
hobbs
and
dick
sat
in
the
and
talked
together
until
midnight
xiv
it
is
astonishing
how
short
a
time
it
takes
for
very
wonderful
things
to
happen
it
had
taken
only
a
few
minutes
apparently
to
change
all
the
fortunes
of
the
little
boy
dangling
his
red
legs
from
the
high
stool
in
hobbs
store
and
to
transform
him
from
a
small
boy
living
the
simplest
life
in
a
quiet
street
into
an
english
nobleman
the
heir
to
an
earldom
and
magnificent
wealth
it
had
taken
only
a
few
minutes
apparently
to
change
him
from
an
english
nobleman
into
a
penniless
little
impostor
with
no
right
to
any
of
the
splendors
he
had
been
enjoying
and
surprising
as
it
may
appear
it
did
not
take
nearly
so
long
a
time
as
one
might
have
expected
to
alter
the
face
of
everything
again
and
to
give
back
to
him
all
that
he
had
been
in
danger
of
losing
it
took
the
less
time
because
after
all
the
woman
who
had
called
herself
lady
fauntleroy
was
not
nearly
so
clever
as
she
was
wicked
and
when
she
had
been
closely
pressed
by
havisham
questions
about
her
marriage
and
her
boy
she
had
made
one
or
two
blunders
which
had
caused
suspicion
to
be
awakened
and
then
she
had
lost
her
presence
of
mind
and
her
temper
and
in
her
excitement
and
anger
had
betrayed
herself
still
further
all
the
mistakes
she
made
were
about
her
child
there
seemed
no
doubt
that
she
had
been
married
to
bevis
lord
fauntleroy
and
had
quarreled
with
him
and
had
been
paid
to
keep
away
from
him
but
havisham
found
out
that
her
story
of
the
boy
being
born
in
a
certain
part
of
london
was
false
and
just
when
they
all
were
in
the
midst
of
the
commotion
caused
by
this
discovery
there
came
the
letter
from
the
young
lawyer
in
new
york
and
hobbs
letters
also
what
an
evening
it
was
when
those
letters
arrived
and
when
havisham
and
the
earl
sat
and
talked
their
plans
over
in
the
library
after
my
first
three
meetings
with
her
said
havisham
i
began
to
suspect
her
strongly
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
child
was
older
than
she
said
he
was
and
she
made
a
slip
in
speaking
of
the
date
of
his
birth
and
then
tried
to
patch
the
matter
up
the
story
these
letters
bring
fits
in
with
several
of
my
suspicions
our
best
plan
will
be
to
cable
at
once
for
these
two
tiptons
say
nothing
about
them
to
her
and
suddenly
confront
her
with
them
when
she
is
not
expecting
it
she
is
only
a
very
clumsy
plotter
after
all
my
opinion
is
that
she
will
be
frightened
out
of
her
wits
and
will
betray
herself
on
the
and
that
was
what
actually
happened
she
was
told
nothing
and
havisham
kept
her
from
suspecting
anything
by
continuing
to
have
interviews
with
her
in
which
he
assured
her
he
was
investigating
her
statements
and
she
really
began
to
feel
so
secure
that
her
spirits
rose
immensely
and
she
began
to
be
as
insolent
as
might
have
been
expected
but
one
fine
morning
as
she
sat
in
her
at
the
inn
called
the
dorincourt
arms
making
some
very
fine
plans
for
herself
havisham
was
announced
and
when
he
entered
he
was
followed
by
no
less
than
three
persons
one
was
a
boy
and
one
was
a
big
young
man
and
the
third
was
the
earl
of
dorincourt
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
actually
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
it
broke
from
her
before
she
had
time
to
check
it
she
had
thought
of
these
as
being
thousands
of
miles
away
when
she
had
ever
thought
of
them
at
all
which
she
had
scarcely
done
for
years
she
had
never
expected
to
see
them
again
it
must
be
confessed
that
dick
grinned
a
little
when
he
saw
her
hello
minna
he
said
the
big
young
man
who
was
ben
stood
still
a
minute
and
looked
at
her
do
you
know
her
havisham
asked
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
yes
said
ben
i
know
her
and
she
knows
and
he
turned
his
back
on
her
and
went
and
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
as
if
the
sight
of
her
was
hateful
to
him
as
indeed
it
was
then
the
woman
seeing
herself
so
baffled
and
exposed
lost
all
control
over
herself
and
flew
into
such
a
rage
as
ben
and
dick
had
often
seen
her
in
before
dick
grinned
a
trifle
more
as
he
watched
her
and
heard
the
names
she
called
them
all
and
the
violent
threats
she
made
but
ben
did
not
turn
to
look
at
her
i
can
swear
to
her
in
any
court
he
said
to
havisham
and
i
can
bring
a
dozen
others
who
will
her
father
is
a
respectable
sort
of
man
though
he
low
down
in
the
world
her
mother
was
just
like
herself
she
dead
but
he
alive
and
he
honest
enough
to
be
ashamed
of
her
he
tell
you
who
she
is
and
whether
she
married
me
or
then
he
clenched
his
hand
suddenly
and
turned
on
her
where
the
child
he
demanded
he
going
with
me
he
is
done
with
you
and
so
am
i
and
just
as
he
finished
saying
the
words
the
door
leading
into
the
bedroom
opened
a
little
and
the
boy
probably
attracted
by
the
sound
of
the
loud
voices
looked
in
he
was
not
a
handsome
boy
but
he
had
rather
a
nice
face
and
he
was
quite
like
ben
his
father
as
any
one
could
see
and
there
was
the
scar
on
his
chin
ben
walked
up
to
him
and
took
his
hand
and
his
own
was
trembling
yes
he
said
i
could
swear
to
him
too
tom
he
said
to
the
little
fellow
i
your
father
i
come
to
take
you
away
where
your
hat
the
boy
pointed
to
where
it
lay
on
a
chair
it
evidently
rather
pleased
him
to
hear
that
he
was
going
away
he
had
been
so
accustomed
to
queer
experiences
that
it
did
not
surprise
him
to
be
told
by
a
stranger
that
he
was
his
father
he
objected
so
much
to
the
woman
who
had
come
a
few
months
before
to
the
place
where
he
had
lived
since
his
babyhood
and
who
had
suddenly
announced
that
she
was
his
mother
that
he
was
quite
ready
for
a
change
ben
took
up
the
hat
and
marched
to
the
door
if
you
want
me
again
he
said
to
havisham
you
know
where
to
find
he
walked
out
of
the
room
holding
the
child
hand
and
not
looking
at
the
woman
once
she
was
fairly
raving
with
fury
and
the
earl
was
calmly
gazing
at
her
through
his
eyeglasses
which
he
had
quietly
placed
upon
his
aristocratic
eagle
nose
come
come
my
young
woman
said
havisham
this
wo
do
at
all
if
you
do
want
to
be
locked
up
you
really
must
behave
and
there
was
something
so
very
in
his
tones
that
probably
feeling
that
the
safest
thing
she
could
do
would
be
to
get
out
of
the
way
she
gave
him
one
savage
look
and
dashed
past
him
into
the
next
room
and
slammed
the
door
we
shall
have
no
more
trouble
with
her
said
havisham
and
he
was
right
for
that
very
night
she
left
the
dorincourt
arms
and
took
the
train
to
london
and
was
seen
no
more
when
the
earl
left
the
room
after
the
interview
he
went
at
once
to
his
carriage
to
court
lodge
he
said
to
thomas
to
court
lodge
said
thomas
to
the
coachman
as
he
mounted
the
box
an
you
may
depend
on
it
things
are
taking
a
uniggspected
when
the
carriage
stopped
at
court
lodge
cedric
was
in
the
with
his
mother
the
earl
came
in
without
being
announced
he
looked
an
inch
or
so
taller
and
a
great
many
years
younger
his
deep
eyes
flashed
where
he
said
is
lord
fauntleroy
errol
came
forward
a
flush
rising
to
her
cheek
is
it
lord
fauntleroy
she
asked
is
it
indeed
the
earl
put
out
his
hand
and
grasped
hers
yes
he
answered
it
then
he
put
his
other
hand
on
cedric
shoulder
fauntleroy
he
said
in
his
unceremonious
authoritative
way
ask
your
mother
when
she
will
come
to
us
at
the
fauntleroy
flung
his
arms
around
his
mother
neck
to
live
with
us
he
cried
to
live
with
us
always
the
earl
looked
at
errol
and
errol
looked
at
the
earl
his
lordship
was
entirely
in
earnest
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
waste
no
time
in
arranging
this
matter
he
had
begun
to
think
it
would
suit
him
to
make
friends
with
his
heir
mother
are
you
quite
sure
you
want
me
said
errol
with
her
soft
pretty
smile
quite
sure
he
said
bluntly
we
have
always
wanted
you
but
we
were
not
exactly
aware
of
it
we
hope
you
will
xv
ben
took
his
boy
and
went
back
to
his
cattle
ranch
in
california
and
he
returned
under
very
comfortable
circumstances
just
before
his
going
havisham
had
an
interview
with
him
in
which
the
lawyer
told
him
that
the
earl
of
dorincourt
wished
to
do
something
for
the
boy
who
might
have
turned
out
to
be
lord
fauntleroy
and
so
he
had
decided
that
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
invest
in
a
cattle
ranch
of
his
own
and
put
ben
in
charge
of
it
on
terms
which
would
make
it
pay
him
very
well
and
which
would
lay
a
foundation
for
his
son
future
and
so
when
ben
went
away
he
went
as
the
prospective
master
of
a
ranch
which
would
be
almost
as
good
as
his
own
and
might
easily
become
his
own
in
time
as
indeed
it
did
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
and
tom
the
boy
grew
up
on
it
into
a
fine
young
man
and
was
devotedly
fond
of
his
father
and
they
were
so
successful
and
happy
that
ben
used
to
say
that
tom
made
up
to
him
for
all
the
troubles
he
had
ever
had
but
dick
and
hobbs
who
had
actually
come
over
with
the
others
to
see
that
things
were
properly
looked
after
did
not
return
for
some
time
it
had
been
decided
at
the
outset
that
the
earl
would
provide
for
dick
and
would
see
that
he
received
a
solid
education
and
hobbs
had
decided
that
as
he
himself
had
left
a
reliable
substitute
in
charge
of
his
store
he
could
afford
to
wait
to
see
the
festivities
which
were
to
celebrate
lord
fauntleroy
eighth
birthday
all
the
tenantry
were
invited
and
there
were
to
be
feasting
and
dancing
and
games
in
the
park
and
bonfires
and
in
the
evening
just
like
the
fourth
of
july
said
lord
fauntleroy
it
seems
a
pity
my
birthday
was
on
the
fourth
does
it
for
then
we
could
keep
them
both
it
must
be
confessed
that
at
first
the
earl
and
hobbs
were
not
as
intimate
as
it
might
have
been
hoped
they
would
become
in
the
interests
of
the
british
aristocracy
the
fact
was
that
the
earl
had
known
very
few
and
hobbs
had
not
had
many
very
close
acquaintances
who
were
earls
and
so
in
their
rare
interviews
conversation
did
not
flourish
it
must
also
be
owned
that
hobbs
had
been
rather
overwhelmed
by
the
splendors
fauntleroy
felt
it
his
duty
to
show
him
the
entrance
gate
and
the
stone
lions
and
the
avenue
impressed
hobbs
somewhat
at
the
beginning
and
when
he
saw
the
castle
and
the
and
the
and
the
terraces
and
the
peacocks
and
the
dungeon
and
the
armor
and
the
great
staircase
and
the
stables
and
the
liveried
servants
he
really
was
quite
bewildered
but
it
was
the
picture
gallery
which
seemed
to
be
the
finishing
stroke
somethin
in
the
manner
of
a
museum
he
said
to
fauntleroy
when
he
was
led
into
the
great
beautiful
room
n
no
said
fauntleroy
rather
doubtfully
i
do
think
it
a
museum
my
grandfather
says
these
are
my
your
aunt
sisters
ejaculated
hobbs
all
of
your
he
must
have
had
a
family
did
he
raise
all
and
he
sank
into
a
seat
and
looked
around
him
with
quite
an
agitated
countenance
until
with
the
greatest
difficulty
lord
fauntleroy
managed
to
explain
that
the
walls
were
not
lined
entirely
with
the
portraits
of
the
progeny
of
his
he
found
it
necessary
in
fact
to
call
in
the
assistance
of
mellon
who
knew
all
about
the
pictures
and
could
tell
who
painted
them
and
when
and
who
added
romantic
stories
of
the
lords
and
ladies
who
were
the
originals
when
hobbs
once
understood
and
had
heard
some
of
these
stories
he
was
very
much
fascinated
and
liked
the
picture
gallery
almost
better
than
anything
else
and
he
would
often
walk
over
from
the
village
where
he
staid
at
the
dorincourt
arms
and
would
spend
half
an
hour
or
so
wandering
about
the
gallery
staring
at
the
painted
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
also
stared
at
him
and
shaking
his
head
nearly
all
the
time
and
they
was
all
earls
he
would
say
er
pretty
nigh
it
an
goin
to
be
one
of
an
own
it
all
privately
he
was
not
nearly
so
much
disgusted
with
earls
and
their
mode
of
life
as
he
had
expected
to
be
and
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
his
strictly
republican
principles
were
not
shaken
a
little
by
a
closer
acquaintance
with
castles
and
ancestors
and
all
the
rest
of
it
at
any
rate
one
day
he
uttered
a
very
remarkable
and
unexpected
sentiment
i
would
have
minded
bein
one
of
myself
he
said
which
was
really
a
great
concession
what
a
grand
day
it
was
when
little
lord
fauntleroy
birthday
arrived
and
how
his
young
lordship
enjoyed
it
how
beautiful
the
park
looked
filled
with
the
thronging
people
dressed
in
their
gayest
and
best
and
with
the
flags
flying
from
the
tents
and
the
top
of
the
castle
nobody
had
staid
away
who
could
possibly
come
because
everybody
was
really
glad
that
little
lord
fauntleroy
was
to
be
little
lord
fauntleroy
still
and
some
day
was
to
be
the
master
of
everything
every
one
wanted
to
have
a
look
at
him
and
at
his
pretty
kind
mother
who
had
made
so
many
friends
and
positively
every
one
liked
the
earl
rather
better
and
felt
more
amiably
toward
him
because
the
little
boy
loved
and
trusted
him
so
and
because
also
he
had
now
made
friends
with
and
behaved
respectfully
to
his
heir
mother
it
was
said
that
he
was
even
beginning
to
be
fond
of
her
too
and
that
between
his
young
lordship
and
his
young
lordship
mother
the
earl
might
be
changed
in
time
into
quite
a
old
nobleman
and
everybody
might
be
happier
and
better
off
what
scores
and
scores
of
people
there
were
under
the
trees
and
in
the
tents
and
on
the
lawns
farmers
and
farmers
wives
in
their
sunday
suits
and
bonnets
and
shawls
girls
and
their
sweethearts
children
frolicking
and
chasing
about
and
old
dames
in
red
cloaks
gossiping
together
at
the
castle
there
were
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
had
come
to
see
the
fun
and
to
congratulate
the
earl
and
to
meet
errol
lady
lorredaile
and
sir
harry
were
there
and
sir
thomas
asshe
and
his
daughters
and
havisham
of
course
and
then
beautiful
miss
vivian
herbert
with
the
loveliest
white
gown
and
lace
parasol
and
a
circle
of
gentlemen
to
take
care
of
her
though
she
evidently
liked
fauntleroy
better
than
all
of
them
put
together
and
when
he
saw
her
and
ran
to
her
and
put
his
arm
around
her
neck
she
put
her
arms
around
him
too
and
kissed
him
as
warmly
as
if
he
had
been
her
own
favorite
little
brother
and
she
said
dear
little
lord
fauntleroy
dear
little
boy
i
am
so
glad
i
am
so
glad
and
afterward
she
walked
about
the
grounds
with
him
and
let
him
show
her
everything
and
when
he
took
her
to
where
hobbs
and
dick
were
and
said
to
her
this
is
my
old
old
friend
hobbs
miss
herbert
and
this
is
my
other
old
friend
dick
i
told
them
how
pretty
you
were
and
i
told
them
they
should
see
you
if
you
came
to
my
birthday
she
shook
hands
with
them
both
and
stood
and
talked
to
them
in
her
prettiest
way
asking
them
about
america
and
their
voyage
and
their
life
since
they
had
been
in
england
while
fauntleroy
stood
by
looking
up
at
her
with
adoring
eyes
and
his
cheeks
quite
flushed
with
delight
because
he
saw
that
hobbs
and
dick
liked
her
so
much
well
said
dick
solemnly
afterward
she
the
daisiest
gal
i
ever
saw
she
well
she
just
a
daisy
that
what
she
is
no
mistake
everybody
looked
after
her
as
she
passed
and
every
one
looked
after
little
lord
fauntleroy
and
the
sun
shone
and
the
flags
fluttered
and
the
games
were
played
and
the
dances
danced
and
as
the
gayeties
went
on
and
the
joyous
afternoon
passed
his
little
lordship
was
simply
radiantly
happy
the
whole
world
seemed
beautiful
to
him
there
was
some
one
else
who
was
happy
too
an
old
man
who
though
he
had
been
rich
and
noble
all
his
life
had
not
often
been
very
honestly
happy
perhaps
indeed
i
shall
tell
you
that
i
think
it
was
because
he
was
rather
better
than
he
had
been
that
he
was
rather
happier
he
had
not
indeed
suddenly
become
as
good
as
fauntleroy
thought
him
but
at
least
he
had
begun
to
love
something
and
he
had
several
times
found
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
doing
the
kind
things
which
the
innocent
kind
little
heart
of
a
child
had
suggested
and
that
was
a
beginning
and
every
day
he
had
been
more
pleased
with
his
son
wife
it
was
true
as
the
people
said
that
he
was
beginning
to
like
her
too
he
liked
to
hear
her
sweet
voice
and
to
see
her
sweet
face
and
as
he
sat
in
his
he
used
to
watch
her
and
listen
as
she
talked
to
her
boy
and
he
heard
loving
gentle
words
which
were
new
to
him
and
he
began
to
see
why
the
little
fellow
who
had
lived
in
a
new
york
side
street
and
known
and
made
friends
with
was
still
so
and
manly
a
little
fellow
that
he
made
no
one
ashamed
of
him
even
when
fortune
changed
him
into
the
heir
to
an
english
earldom
living
in
an
english
castle
it
was
really
a
very
simple
thing
after
all
it
was
only
that
he
had
lived
near
a
kind
and
gentle
heart
and
had
been
taught
to
think
kind
thoughts
always
and
to
care
for
others
it
is
a
very
little
thing
perhaps
but
it
is
the
best
thing
of
all
he
knew
nothing
of
earls
and
castles
he
was
quite
ignorant
of
all
grand
and
splendid
things
but
he
was
always
lovable
because
he
was
simple
and
loving
to
be
so
is
like
being
born
a
king
as
the
old
earl
of
dorincourt
looked
at
him
that
day
moving
about
the
park
among
the
people
talking
to
those
he
knew
and
making
his
ready
little
bow
when
any
one
greeted
him
entertaining
his
friends
dick
and
hobbs
or
standing
near
his
mother
or
miss
herbert
listening
to
their
conversation
the
old
nobleman
was
very
well
satisfied
with
him
and
he
had
never
been
better
satisfied
than
he
was
when
they
went
down
to
the
biggest
tent
where
the
more
important
tenants
of
the
dorincourt
estate
were
sitting
down
to
the
grand
collation
of
the
day
they
were
drinking
toasts
and
after
they
had
drunk
the
health
of
the
earl
with
much
more
enthusiasm
than
his
name
had
ever
been
greeted
with
before
they
proposed
the
health
of
little
lord
and
if
there
had
ever
been
any
doubt
at
all
as
to
whether
his
lordship
was
popular
or
not
it
would
have
been
settled
that
instant
such
a
clamor
of
voices
and
such
a
rattle
of
glasses
and
applause
they
had
begun
to
like
him
so
much
those
people
that
they
forgot
to
feel
any
restraint
before
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
from
the
castle
who
had
come
to
see
them
they
made
quite
a
decent
uproar
and
one
or
two
motherly
women
looked
tenderly
at
the
little
fellow
where
he
stood
with
his
mother
on
one
side
and
the
earl
on
the
other
and
grew
quite
moist
about
the
eyes
and
said
to
one
another
god
bless
him
the
pretty
little
dear
little
lord
fauntleroy
was
delighted
he
stood
and
smiled
and
made
bows
and
flushed
rosy
red
with
pleasure
up
to
the
roots
of
his
bright
hair
is
it
because
they
like
me
dearest
he
said
to
his
mother
is
it
dearest
i
so
glad
and
then
the
earl
put
his
hand
on
the
child
shoulder
and
said
to
him
fauntleroy
say
to
them
that
you
thank
them
for
their
fauntleroy
gave
a
glance
up
at
him
and
then
at
his
mother
must
i
he
asked
just
a
trifle
shyly
and
she
smiled
and
so
did
miss
herbert
and
they
both
nodded
and
so
he
made
a
little
step
forward
and
everybody
looked
at
him
such
a
beautiful
innocent
little
fellow
he
was
too
with
his
brave
trustful
face
and
he
spoke
as
loudly
as
he
could
his
childish
voice
ringing
out
quite
clear
and
strong
i
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
he
said
and
i
hope
you
enjoy
my
birthday
because
i
enjoyed
it
so
much
and
i
very
glad
i
going
to
be
an
earl
i
did
think
at
first
i
should
like
it
but
now
i
do
and
i
love
this
place
so
and
i
think
it
is
beautiful
and
and
and
when
i
am
an
earl
i
am
going
to
try
to
be
as
good
as
my
and
amid
the
shouts
and
clamor
of
applause
he
stepped
back
with
a
little
sigh
of
relief
and
put
his
hand
into
the
earl
and
stood
close
to
him
smiling
and
leaning
against
his
side
and
that
would
be
the
very
end
of
my
story
but
i
must
add
one
curious
piece
of
information
which
is
that
hobbs
became
so
fascinated
with
high
life
and
was
so
reluctant
to
leave
his
young
friend
that
he
actually
sold
his
corner
store
in
new
york
and
settled
in
the
english
village
of
erlesboro
where
he
opened
a
shop
which
was
patronized
by
the
castle
and
consequently
was
a
great
success
and
though
he
and
the
earl
never
became
very
intimate
if
you
will
believe
me
that
man
hobbs
became
in
time
more
aristocratic
than
his
lordship
himself
and
he
read
the
court
news
every
morning
and
followed
all
the
doings
of
the
house
of
lords
and
about
ten
years
after
when
dick
who
had
finished
his
education
and
was
going
to
visit
his
brother
in
california
asked
the
good
grocer
if
he
did
not
wish
to
return
to
america
he
shook
his
head
seriously
not
to
live
there
he
said
not
to
live
there
i
want
to
be
near
him
an
sort
o
look
after
him
it
a
good
enough
country
for
them
young
an
stirrin
but
there
faults
in
it
there
not
an
auntsister
among
nor
an
earl
