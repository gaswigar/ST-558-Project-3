the
a
trio
and
quartette
by
robert
louis
stevenson
and
lloyde
osbourne
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
part
i
chapter
night
on
the
beach
throughout
the
island
world
of
the
pacific
scattered
men
of
many
european
races
and
from
almost
every
grade
of
society
carry
activity
and
disseminate
disease
some
prosper
some
vegetate
some
have
mounted
the
steps
of
thrones
and
owned
islands
and
navies
others
again
must
marry
for
a
livelihood
a
strapping
merry
dame
supports
them
in
sheer
idleness
and
dressed
like
natives
but
still
retaining
some
foreign
element
of
gait
or
attitude
still
perhaps
with
some
relic
such
as
a
single
of
the
officer
and
gentleman
they
sprawl
in
verandahs
and
entertain
an
island
audience
with
memoirs
of
the
and
there
are
still
others
less
pliable
less
capable
less
fortunate
perhaps
less
base
who
continue
even
in
these
isles
of
plenty
to
lack
bread
at
the
far
end
of
the
town
of
papeete
three
such
men
were
seated
on
the
beach
under
a
purao
tree
it
was
late
long
ago
the
band
had
broken
up
and
marched
musically
home
a
motley
troop
of
men
and
women
merchant
clerks
and
navy
officers
dancing
in
its
wake
arms
about
waist
and
crowned
with
garlands
long
ago
darkness
and
silence
had
gone
from
house
to
house
about
the
tiny
pagan
city
only
the
street
lamps
shone
on
making
a
halo
in
the
umbrageous
alleys
or
drawing
a
tremulous
image
on
the
waters
of
the
port
a
sound
of
snoring
ran
among
the
piles
of
lumber
by
the
government
pier
it
was
wafted
ashore
from
the
graceful
schooners
where
they
lay
moored
close
in
like
dinghies
and
their
crews
were
stretched
upon
the
deck
under
the
open
sky
or
huddled
in
a
rude
tent
amidst
the
disorder
of
merchandise
but
the
men
under
the
purao
had
no
thought
of
sleep
the
same
temperature
in
england
would
have
passed
without
remark
in
summer
but
it
was
bitter
cold
for
the
south
seas
inanimate
nature
knew
it
and
the
bottle
of
cocoanut
oil
stood
frozen
in
every
house
about
the
island
and
the
men
knew
it
and
shivered
they
wore
flimsy
cotton
clothes
the
same
they
had
sweated
in
by
day
and
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
tropic
showers
and
to
complete
their
evil
case
they
had
no
breakfast
to
mention
less
dinner
and
no
supper
at
all
in
the
telling
south
sea
phrase
these
three
men
were
on
the
beach
common
calamity
had
brought
them
acquainted
as
the
three
most
miserable
creatures
in
tahiti
and
beyond
their
misery
they
knew
next
to
nothing
of
each
other
not
even
their
true
names
for
each
had
made
a
long
apprenticeship
in
going
downward
and
each
at
some
stage
of
the
descent
had
been
shamed
into
the
adoption
of
an
alias
and
yet
not
one
of
them
had
figured
in
a
court
of
justice
two
were
men
of
kindly
virtues
and
one
as
he
sat
and
shivered
under
the
purao
had
a
tattered
virgil
in
his
pocket
certainly
if
money
could
have
been
raised
upon
the
book
robert
herrick
would
long
ago
have
sacrificed
that
last
possession
but
the
demand
for
literature
which
is
so
marked
a
feature
in
some
parts
of
the
south
seas
extends
not
so
far
as
the
dead
tongues
and
the
virgil
which
he
could
not
exchange
against
a
meal
had
often
consoled
him
in
his
hunger
he
would
study
it
as
he
lay
with
tightened
belt
on
the
floor
of
the
old
calaboose
seeking
favourite
passages
and
finding
new
ones
only
less
beautiful
because
they
lacked
the
consecration
of
remembrance
or
he
would
pause
on
random
country
walks
sit
on
the
path
side
gazing
over
the
sea
on
the
mountains
of
eimeo
and
dip
into
the
aeneid
seeking
sortes
and
if
the
oracle
as
is
the
way
of
oracles
replied
with
no
very
certain
nor
encouraging
voice
visions
of
england
at
least
would
throng
upon
the
exile
memory
the
busy
schoolroom
the
green
holidays
at
home
and
the
perennial
roar
of
london
and
the
fireside
and
the
white
head
of
his
father
for
it
is
the
destiny
of
those
grave
restrained
and
classic
writers
with
whom
we
make
enforced
and
often
painful
acquaintanceship
at
school
to
pass
into
the
blood
and
become
native
in
the
memory
so
that
a
phrase
of
virgil
speaks
not
so
much
of
mantua
or
augustus
but
of
english
places
and
the
student
own
irrevocable
youth
robert
herrick
was
the
son
of
an
intelligent
active
and
ambitious
man
small
partner
in
a
considerable
london
house
hopes
were
conceived
of
the
boy
he
was
sent
to
a
good
school
gained
there
an
oxford
scholarship
and
proceeded
in
course
to
the
western
university
with
all
his
talent
and
taste
and
he
had
much
of
both
robert
was
deficient
in
consistency
and
intellectual
manhood
wandered
in
bypaths
of
study
worked
at
music
or
at
metaphysics
when
he
should
have
been
at
greek
and
took
at
last
a
paltry
degree
almost
at
the
same
time
the
london
house
was
disastrously
wound
up
mr
herrick
must
begin
the
world
again
as
a
clerk
in
a
strange
office
and
robert
relinquish
his
ambitions
and
accept
with
gratitude
a
career
that
he
detested
and
despised
he
had
no
head
for
figures
no
interest
in
affairs
detested
the
constraint
of
hours
and
despised
the
aims
and
the
success
of
merchants
to
grow
rich
was
none
of
his
ambitions
rather
to
do
well
a
worse
or
a
more
bold
young
man
would
have
refused
the
destiny
perhaps
tried
his
future
with
his
pen
perhaps
enlisted
robert
more
prudent
possibly
more
timid
consented
to
embrace
that
way
of
life
in
which
he
could
most
readily
assist
his
family
but
he
did
so
with
a
mind
divided
fled
the
neighbourhood
of
former
comrades
and
chose
out
of
several
positions
placed
at
his
disposal
a
clerkship
in
new
york
his
career
thenceforth
was
one
of
unbroken
shame
he
did
not
drink
he
was
exactly
honest
he
was
never
rude
to
his
employers
yet
was
everywhere
discharged
bringing
no
interest
to
his
duties
he
brought
no
attention
his
day
was
a
tissue
of
things
neglected
and
things
done
amiss
and
from
place
to
place
and
from
town
to
town
he
carried
the
character
of
one
thoroughly
incompetent
no
man
can
bear
the
word
applied
to
him
without
some
flush
of
colour
as
indeed
there
is
none
other
that
so
emphatically
slams
in
a
man
face
the
door
of
and
to
herrick
who
was
conscious
of
talents
and
acquirements
who
looked
down
upon
those
humble
duties
in
which
he
was
found
wanting
the
pain
was
the
more
exquisite
early
in
his
fall
he
had
ceased
to
be
able
to
make
remittances
shortly
after
having
nothing
but
failure
to
communicate
he
ceased
writing
home
and
about
a
year
before
this
tale
begins
turned
suddenly
upon
the
streets
of
san
francisco
by
a
vulgar
and
infuriated
german
jew
he
had
broken
the
last
bonds
of
and
upon
a
sudden
impulse
changed
his
name
and
invested
his
last
dollar
in
a
passage
on
the
mail
brigantine
the
city
of
papeete
with
what
expectation
he
had
trimmed
his
flight
for
the
south
seas
herrick
perhaps
scarcely
knew
doubtless
there
were
fortunes
to
be
made
in
pearl
and
copra
doubtless
others
not
more
gifted
than
himself
had
climbed
in
the
island
world
to
be
queen
consorts
and
king
ministers
but
if
herrick
had
gone
there
with
any
manful
purpose
he
would
have
kept
his
father
name
the
alias
betrayed
his
moral
bankruptcy
he
had
struck
his
flag
he
entertained
no
hope
to
reinstate
himself
or
help
his
straitened
family
and
he
came
to
the
islands
where
he
knew
the
climate
to
be
soft
bread
cheap
and
manners
easy
a
skulker
from
life
battle
and
his
own
immediate
duty
failure
he
had
said
was
his
portion
let
it
be
a
pleasant
failure
it
is
fortunately
not
enough
to
say
will
be
base
herrick
continued
in
the
islands
his
career
of
failure
but
in
the
new
scene
and
under
the
new
name
he
suffered
no
less
sharply
than
before
a
place
was
got
it
was
lost
in
the
old
style
from
the
of
the
keepers
of
restaurants
he
fell
to
more
open
charity
upon
the
wayside
as
time
went
on
good
nature
became
weary
and
after
a
repulse
or
two
herrick
became
shy
there
were
women
enough
who
would
have
supported
a
far
worse
and
a
far
uglier
man
herrick
never
met
or
never
knew
them
or
if
he
did
both
some
manlier
feeling
would
revolt
and
he
preferred
starvation
drenched
with
rains
broiling
by
day
shivering
by
night
a
disused
and
ruinous
prison
for
a
bedroom
his
diet
begged
or
pilfered
out
of
rubbish
heaps
his
associates
two
creatures
equally
outcast
with
himself
he
had
drained
for
months
the
cup
of
penitence
he
had
known
what
it
was
to
be
resigned
what
it
was
to
break
forth
in
a
childish
fury
of
rebellion
against
fate
and
what
it
was
to
sink
into
the
coma
of
despair
the
time
had
changed
him
he
told
himself
no
longer
tales
of
an
easy
and
perhaps
agreeable
declension
he
read
his
nature
otherwise
he
had
proved
himself
incapable
of
rising
and
he
now
learned
by
experience
that
he
could
not
stoop
to
fall
something
that
was
scarcely
pride
or
strength
that
was
perhaps
only
refinement
withheld
him
from
capitulation
but
he
looked
on
upon
his
own
misfortune
with
a
growing
rage
and
sometimes
wondered
at
his
patience
it
was
now
the
fourth
month
completed
and
still
there
was
no
change
or
sign
of
change
the
moon
racing
through
a
world
of
flying
clouds
of
every
size
and
shape
and
density
some
black
as
ink
stains
some
delicate
as
lawn
threw
the
marvel
of
her
southern
brightness
over
the
same
lovely
and
detested
scene
the
island
mountains
crowned
with
the
perennial
island
cloud
the
embowered
city
studded
with
rare
lamps
the
masts
in
the
harbour
the
smooth
mirror
of
the
lagoon
and
the
mole
of
the
barrier
reef
on
which
the
breakers
whitened
the
moon
shone
too
with
sweeps
on
his
companions
on
the
stalwart
frame
of
the
american
who
called
himself
brown
and
was
known
to
be
a
master
mariner
in
some
disgrace
and
on
the
dwarfish
person
the
pale
eyes
and
toothless
smile
of
a
vulgar
and
cockney
clerk
here
was
society
for
robert
herrick
the
yankee
skipper
was
a
man
at
least
he
had
sterling
qualities
of
tenderness
and
resolution
he
was
one
whose
hand
you
could
take
without
a
blush
but
there
was
no
redeeming
grace
about
the
other
who
called
himself
sometimes
hay
and
sometimes
tomkins
and
laughed
at
the
discrepancy
who
had
been
employed
in
every
store
in
papeete
for
the
creature
was
able
in
his
way
who
had
been
discharged
from
each
in
turn
for
he
was
wholly
vile
who
had
alienated
all
his
old
employers
so
that
they
passed
him
in
the
street
as
if
he
were
a
dog
and
all
his
old
comrades
so
that
they
shunned
him
as
they
would
a
creditor
not
long
before
a
ship
from
peru
had
brought
an
influenza
and
it
now
raged
in
the
island
and
particularly
in
papeete
from
all
round
the
purao
arose
and
fell
a
dismal
sound
of
men
coughing
and
strangling
as
they
coughed
the
sick
natives
with
the
islander
impatience
of
a
touch
of
fever
had
crawled
from
their
houses
to
be
cool
and
squatting
on
the
shore
or
on
the
beached
canoes
painfully
expected
the
new
day
even
as
the
crowing
of
cocks
goes
about
the
country
in
the
night
from
farm
to
farm
accesses
of
coughing
arose
and
spread
and
died
in
the
distance
and
sprang
up
again
each
miserable
shiverer
caught
the
suggestion
from
his
neighbour
was
torn
for
some
minutes
by
that
cruel
ecstasy
and
left
spent
and
without
voice
or
courage
when
it
passed
if
a
man
had
pity
to
spend
papeete
beach
in
that
cold
night
and
in
that
infected
season
was
a
place
to
spend
it
on
and
of
all
the
sufferers
perhaps
the
least
deserving
but
surely
the
most
pitiable
was
the
london
clerk
he
was
used
to
another
life
to
houses
beds
nursing
and
the
dainties
of
the
sickroom
he
lay
there
now
in
the
cold
open
exposed
to
the
gusting
of
the
wind
and
with
an
empty
belly
he
was
besides
infirm
the
disease
shook
him
to
the
vitals
and
his
companions
watched
his
endurance
with
surprise
a
profound
commiseration
filled
them
and
contended
with
and
conquered
their
abhorrence
the
disgust
attendant
on
so
ugly
a
sickness
magnified
this
dislike
at
the
same
time
and
with
more
than
compensating
strength
shame
for
a
sentiment
so
inhuman
bound
them
the
more
straitly
to
his
service
and
even
the
evil
they
knew
of
him
swelled
their
solicitude
for
the
thought
of
death
is
always
the
least
supportable
when
it
draws
near
to
the
merely
sensual
and
selfish
sometimes
they
held
him
up
sometimes
with
mistaken
helpfulness
they
beat
him
between
the
shoulders
and
when
the
poor
wretch
lay
back
ghastly
and
spent
after
a
paroxysm
of
coughing
they
would
sometimes
peer
into
his
face
doubtfully
exploring
it
for
any
mark
of
life
there
is
no
one
but
has
some
virtue
that
of
the
clerk
was
courage
and
he
would
make
haste
to
reassure
them
in
a
pleasantry
not
always
decent
all
right
pals
he
gasped
once
is
the
thing
to
strengthen
the
muscles
of
the
larynx
you
take
the
cake
cried
the
captain
i
good
plucked
enough
pursued
the
sufferer
with
a
broken
utterance
it
do
seem
bloomin
hard
to
me
that
i
should
be
the
only
party
down
with
this
form
of
vice
and
the
only
one
to
do
the
funny
business
i
think
one
of
you
other
parties
might
wake
up
tell
a
fellow
something
trouble
is
we
nothing
to
tell
my
son
returned
the
captain
tell
you
if
you
like
what
i
was
thinking
said
herrick
us
anything
said
the
clerk
only
want
to
be
reminded
that
i
ai
dead
herrick
took
up
his
parable
lying
on
his
face
and
speaking
slowly
and
scarce
above
his
breath
not
like
a
man
who
has
anything
to
say
but
like
one
talking
against
time
i
was
thinking
this
he
began
was
thinking
i
lay
on
papeete
beach
one
night
all
moon
and
squalls
and
fellows
coughing
and
i
was
cold
and
hungry
and
down
in
the
mouth
and
was
about
ninety
years
of
age
and
had
spent
two
hundred
and
twenty
of
them
on
papeete
beach
and
i
was
thinking
i
wished
i
had
a
ring
to
rub
or
had
a
fairy
godmother
or
could
raise
beelzebub
and
i
was
trying
to
remember
how
you
did
it
i
knew
you
made
a
ring
of
skulls
for
i
had
seen
that
in
the
freischutz
and
that
you
took
off
your
coat
and
turned
up
your
sleeves
for
i
had
seen
formes
do
that
when
he
was
playing
kaspar
and
you
could
see
by
the
way
he
went
about
it
it
was
a
business
he
had
studied
and
that
you
ought
to
have
something
to
kick
up
a
smoke
and
a
bad
smell
i
dare
say
a
cigar
might
do
and
that
you
ought
to
say
the
lord
prayer
backwards
well
i
wondered
if
i
could
do
that
it
seemed
rather
a
feat
you
see
and
then
i
wondered
if
i
would
say
it
forward
and
i
thought
i
did
well
no
sooner
had
i
got
to
world
without
end
than
i
saw
a
man
in
a
pariu
and
with
a
mat
under
his
arm
come
along
the
beach
from
the
town
he
was
rather
a
old
party
and
he
limped
and
crippled
and
all
the
time
he
kept
coughing
at
first
i
did
cotton
to
his
looks
i
thought
and
then
i
got
sorry
for
the
old
soul
because
he
coughed
so
hard
i
remembered
that
we
had
some
of
that
cough
mixture
the
american
consul
gave
the
captain
for
hay
it
never
did
hay
a
of
service
but
i
thought
it
might
do
the
old
gentleman
business
for
him
and
stood
up
yorana
says
i
yorana
says
he
look
here
i
said
i
got
some
stuff
in
a
bottle
it
fix
your
cough
savvy
and
i
measure
you
a
tablespoonful
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
for
all
our
plate
is
at
the
so
i
thought
the
old
party
came
up
and
the
nearer
he
came
the
less
i
took
to
him
but
i
had
passed
my
word
you
see
is
this
bloomin
drivel
interrupted
the
clerk
like
the
rot
there
is
in
tracts
a
story
i
used
to
tell
them
to
the
kids
at
home
said
herrick
it
bores
you
i
drop
it
cut
along
returned
the
sick
man
irritably
better
than
nothing
continued
herrick
had
no
sooner
given
him
the
cough
mixture
than
he
seemed
to
straighten
up
and
change
and
i
saw
he
was
a
tahitian
after
all
but
some
kind
of
arab
and
had
a
long
beard
on
his
chin
one
good
turn
deserves
another
says
he
i
am
a
magician
out
of
the
arabian
nights
and
this
mat
that
i
have
under
my
arm
is
the
original
carpet
of
mohammed
ben
say
the
word
and
you
can
have
a
cruise
upon
the
you
do
mean
to
say
this
is
the
travelling
carpet
i
cried
you
bet
i
do
said
he
you
been
to
america
since
last
i
read
the
arabian
nights
said
i
a
little
suspicious
i
should
think
so
said
he
been
everywhere
a
man
with
a
carpet
like
this
is
going
to
moulder
in
a
well
that
struck
me
as
reasonable
all
right
i
said
and
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
i
can
get
on
that
carpet
and
go
straight
to
london
england
i
said
london
england
captain
because
he
seemed
to
have
been
so
long
in
your
part
of
the
world
in
the
crack
of
a
whip
said
he
i
figured
up
the
time
what
is
the
difference
between
papeete
and
london
captain
greenwich
and
point
venus
nine
hours
odd
minutes
and
seconds
replied
the
mariner
that
about
what
i
made
it
resumed
herrick
nine
hours
calling
this
three
in
the
morning
i
made
out
i
would
drop
into
london
about
noon
and
the
idea
tickled
me
immensely
there
only
one
bother
i
said
i
have
a
copper
cent
it
would
be
a
pity
to
go
to
london
and
not
buy
the
morning
o
said
he
you
realise
the
conveniences
of
this
carpet
you
see
this
pocket
only
got
to
stick
your
hand
in
and
you
pull
it
out
filled
with
was
iff
inquired
the
captain
was
what
it
was
cried
herrick
thought
they
seemed
unusually
big
and
i
remember
now
i
had
to
go
to
the
at
charing
cross
and
get
english
silver
you
went
there
said
the
clerk
did
you
do
bet
you
had
a
and
you
see
it
was
just
as
the
old
boy
said
like
the
cut
of
a
whip
said
herrick
one
minute
i
was
here
on
the
beach
at
three
in
the
morning
the
next
i
was
in
front
of
the
golden
cross
at
midday
at
first
i
was
dazzled
and
covered
my
eyes
and
there
did
seem
the
smallest
change
the
roar
of
the
strand
and
the
roar
of
the
reef
were
like
the
same
hark
to
it
now
and
you
can
hear
the
cabs
and
buses
rolling
and
the
streets
resound
and
then
at
last
i
could
look
about
and
there
was
the
old
place
and
no
mistake
with
the
statues
in
the
square
and
st
and
the
bobbies
and
the
sparrows
and
the
hacks
and
i
ca
tell
you
what
i
felt
like
i
felt
like
crying
i
believe
or
dancing
or
jumping
clean
over
the
nelson
column
i
was
like
a
fellow
caught
up
out
of
hell
and
flung
down
into
the
dandiest
part
of
heaven
then
i
spotted
for
a
hansom
with
a
spanking
horse
a
shilling
for
yourself
if
you
there
in
twenty
minutes
said
i
to
the
jarvey
he
went
a
good
pace
though
of
course
it
was
a
trifle
to
the
carpet
and
in
nineteen
minutes
and
a
half
i
was
at
the
door
door
asked
the
captain
a
house
i
know
of
returned
herrick
it
was
a
cried
the
clerk
only
these
were
not
his
words
did
you
take
the
carpet
there
instead
of
trundling
in
a
growler
did
want
to
startle
a
quiet
street
said
the
narrator
form
and
besides
it
was
a
hansom
and
what
did
you
do
next
inquired
the
captain
i
went
in
said
herrick
old
folks
asked
the
captain
about
it
said
the
other
chewing
a
grass
i
think
you
are
about
the
poorest
at
a
yarn
cried
the
clerk
it
like
ministering
children
i
can
tell
you
there
would
be
more
beer
and
skittles
about
my
little
jaunt
i
would
go
and
have
a
and
for
luck
then
i
would
get
a
big
ulster
with
astrakhan
fur
and
take
my
cane
and
do
the
down
piccadilly
then
i
would
go
to
a
restaurant
and
have
green
peas
and
a
bottle
of
fizz
and
a
chump
chop
oh
and
i
forgot
i
some
devilled
whitebait
first
and
green
gooseberry
tart
and
coffee
and
some
of
that
form
of
vice
in
big
bottles
with
a
seal
benedictine
that
the
nyme
then
i
drop
into
a
theatre
and
pal
on
with
some
chappies
and
do
the
dancing
rooms
and
bars
and
that
and
would
go
till
morning
till
daylight
doth
appear
and
the
next
day
i
have
muffin
and
fresh
butter
would
i
just
o
my
the
clerk
was
interrupted
by
a
fresh
attack
of
coughing
now
i
tell
you
what
i
would
do
said
the
captain
would
have
none
of
your
fancy
rigs
with
the
man
driving
from
the
mizzen
but
a
plain
hack
cab
of
the
highest
registered
tonnage
first
of
all
i
would
bring
up
at
the
market
and
get
a
turkey
and
a
then
i
go
to
a
wine
merchant
and
get
a
dozen
of
champagne
and
a
dozen
of
some
sweet
wine
rich
and
sticky
and
strong
something
in
the
port
or
madeira
line
the
best
in
the
store
then
bear
up
for
a
and
lay
out
twenty
dollars
in
assorted
toys
for
the
piccaninnies
and
then
to
a
confectioner
and
take
in
cakes
and
pies
and
fancy
bread
and
that
stuff
with
the
plums
in
it
and
then
to
a

buy
all
the
papers

the
picture

for
the
kids
and
all
the
story

the
old
girl
about
the
earl
discovering
himself
to

the
escape
of
the
lady
maude
from
the
private
madhouse
and
then
i
tell
the
fellow
to
drive

to
be
some
syrup
for
the
kids
suggested
herrick
like
syrup
syrup
for
the
kids
red
syrup
at
that
said
the
captain
those
things
they
pull
at
and
go
pop
and
have
measly
poetry
inside
and
then
i
tell
you
we
have
a
thanksgiving
day
and
christmas
tree
combined
great
scott
but
i
would
like
to
see
the
kids
i
guess
they
would
light
right
out
of
the
house
when
they
saw
daddy
driving
up
my
little
adar
the
captain
stopped
sharply
keep
it
up
said
the
clerk
damned
thing
is
i
do
know
if
they
ai
starving
cried
the
captain
ca
be
worse
off
than
we
are
and
that
one
comfort
returned
the
clerk
defy
the
devil
to
make
me
worse
off
it
seemed
as
if
the
devil
heard
him
the
light
of
the
moon
had
been
some
time
cut
off
and
they
had
talked
in
darkness
now
there
was
heard
a
roar
which
drew
impetuously
nearer
the
face
of
the
lagoon
was
seen
to
whiten
and
before
they
had
staggered
to
their
feet
a
squall
burst
in
rain
upon
the
outcasts
the
rage
and
volume
of
that
avalanche
one
must
have
lived
in
the
tropics
to
conceive
a
man
panted
in
its
assault
as
he
might
pant
under
a
and
the
world
seemed
whelmed
in
night
and
water
they
fled
groping
for
their
usual
shelter
it
might
be
almost
called
their
home
in
the
old
calaboose
came
drenched
into
its
empty
chambers
and
lay
down
three
sops
of
humanity
on
the
cold
coral
floors
and
presently
when
the
squall
was
overpast
the
others
could
hear
in
the
darkness
the
chattering
of
the
clerk
teeth
say
you
fellows
he
walled
god
sake
lie
up
and
try
to
warm
me
i
blymed
if
i
do
think
i
die
else
so
the
three
crept
together
into
one
wet
mass
and
lay
until
day
came
shivering
and
dozing
off
and
continually
to
wretchedness
by
the
coughing
of
the
clerk
chapter
morning
on
the
beach
the
three
letters
the
clouds
were
all
fled
the
beauty
of
the
tropic
day
was
spread
upon
papeete
and
the
wall
of
breaking
seas
upon
the
reef
and
the
palms
upon
the
islet
already
trembled
in
the
heat
a
french
was
going
out
homeward
bound
she
lay
in
the
middle
distance
of
the
port
an
ant
heap
for
activity
in
the
night
a
schooner
had
come
in
and
now
lay
far
out
hard
by
the
passage
and
the
yellow
flag
the
emblem
of
pestilence
flew
on
her
from
up
the
coast
a
long
procession
of
canoes
headed
round
the
point
and
towards
the
market
bright
as
a
scarf
with
the
clothing
of
the
natives
and
the
piles
of
fruit
but
not
even
the
beauty
and
the
welcome
warmth
of
the
morning
not
even
these
naval
movements
so
interesting
to
sailors
and
to
idlers
could
engage
the
attention
of
the
outcasts
they
were
still
cold
at
heart
their
mouths
sour
from
the
want
of
steep
their
steps
rambling
from
the
lack
of
food
and
they
strung
like
lame
geese
along
the
beach
in
a
disheartened
silence
it
was
towards
the
town
they
moved
towards
the
town
whence
smoke
arose
where
happier
folk
were
breakfasting
and
as
they
went
their
hungry
eyes
were
upon
all
sides
but
they
were
only
scouting
for
a
meal
a
small
and
dingy
schooner
lay
snug
against
the
quay
with
which
it
was
connected
by
a
plank
on
the
forward
deck
under
a
spot
of
awning
five
kanakas
who
made
up
the
crew
were
squatted
round
a
basin
of
fried
feis
and
drinking
coffee
from
tin
mugs
bells
knock
off
for
breakfast
cried
the
captain
with
a
miserable
heartiness
tried
this
craft
before
positively
my
first
appearance
guess
i
draw
a
bumper
house
he
came
close
up
to
where
the
plank
rested
on
the
grassy
quay
turned
his
back
upon
the
schooner
and
began
to
whistle
that
lively
air
irish
washerwoman
it
caught
the
ears
of
the
kanaka
seamen
like
a
preconcerted
signal
with
one
accord
they
looked
up
from
their
meal
and
crowded
to
the
ship
side
fei
in
hand
and
munching
as
they
looked
even
as
a
poor
brown
pyrenean
bear
dances
in
the
streets
of
english
towns
under
his
master
baton
even
so
but
with
how
much
more
of
spirit
and
precision
the
captain
footed
it
in
time
to
his
own
whistling
and
his
long
morning
shadow
capered
beyond
him
on
the
grass
the
kanakas
smiled
on
the
performance
herrick
looked
on
hunger
for
the
moment
conquering
all
sense
of
shame
and
a
little
farther
off
but
still
hard
by
the
clerk
was
torn
by
the
seven
devils
of
the
influenza
the
captain
stopped
suddenly
appeared
to
perceive
his
audience
for
the
first
time
and
represented
the
part
of
a
man
surprised
in
his
private
hour
of
pleasure
said
he
the
kanakas
clapped
hands
and
called
upon
him
to
go
on
sir
said
the
captain
eat
no
dance
savvy
old
man
returned
one
of
the
crew
no

the
captain
too

the
sailor
tome

plenty
fei
nutha
man
him
tome
too
guess
we
drop
right
in
observed
the
captain
and
he
and
his
companions
hastened
up
the
plank
they
were
welcomed
on
board
with
the
shaking
of
hands
place
was
made
for
them
about
the
basin
a
sticky
demijohn
of
molasses
was
added
to
the
feast
in
honour
of
company
and
an
accordion
brought
from
the
forecastle
and
significantly
laid
by
the
performer
side
said
he
lightly
touching
the
instrument
as
he
spoke
and
he
fell
to
on
a
long
savoury
fei
made
an
end
of
it
raised
his
mug
of
coffee
and
nodded
across
at
the
spokesman
of
the
crew
your
health
old
man
you
a
credit
to
the
south
pacific
said
he
with
the
unsightly
greed
of
hounds
they
glutted
themselves
with
the
hot
food
and
coffee
and
even
the
clerk
revived
and
the
colour
deepened
in
his
eyes
the
kettle
was
drained
the
basin
cleaned
their
entertainers
who
had
waited
on
their
wants
throughout
with
the
pleased
hospitality
of
polynesians
made
haste
to
bring
forward
a
dessert
of
island
tobacco
and
rolls
of
pandanus
leaf
to
serve
as
paper
and
presently
all
sat
about
the
dishes
puffing
like
indian
sachems
a
man
breakfast
every
day
he
do
know
what
it
is
observed
the
clerk
next
point
is
dinner
said
herrick
and
then
with
a
passionate
utterance
wish
to
god
i
was
a
kanaka
one
thing
sure
said
the
captain
about
desperate
rather
hang
than
rot
here
much
longer
and
with
the
word
he
took
the
accordion
and
struck
up
sweet
home
drop
that
cried
herrick
ca
stand
that
more
can
i
said
the
captain
got
to
play
something
though
got
to
pay
the
shot
my
son
and
he
struck
up
brown
body
in
a
fine
sweet
baritone
jim
of
carolina
came
next
the
bold
low
sweet
chariot
and
beautiful
land
followed
the
captain
was
paying
his
shot
with
usury
as
he
had
done
many
a
time
before
many
a
meal
had
he
bought
with
the
same
currency
from
the
natives
always
as
now
to
their
delight
he
was
in
the
middle
of
dollars
in
the
inside
pocket
singing
with
dogged
energy
for
the
task
went
sore
against
the
grain
when
a
sensation
was
suddenly
to
be
observed
among
the
crew
tom
harry
my
said
the
spokesman
pointing
and
the
three
beachcombers
following
his
indication
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
in
pyjama
trousers
and
a
white
jumper
approaching
briskly
from
the
town
tom
is
coming
tapena
tom
is
it
said
the
captain
pausing
in
his
music
do

to
place
the
brute
better

said
the
clerk
no
good
said
the
musician
deliberately
ca
most
generally

try
it
on
i
guess
music
has
charms
to
soothe
the
savage
tapena
boys
we
might
strike
it
rich
it
might
amount
to
iced
punch
in
the
cabin

said
the
clerk
him
something
captain
way
down
the
swannee
river

said
the
captain
and
he
struck
for
his
life
into
lang
syne
captain
tom
continued
to
approach
with
the
same
alacrity
no
change
was
to
be
perceived
in
his
bearded
face
as
he
came
swinging
up
the
plank
he
did
not
even
turn
his
eyes
on
the
performer
twa
hae
paidled
in
the
burn
frae
morning
tide
till
dine
went
the
song
captain
tom
had
a
parcel
under
his
arm
which
he
laid
on
the
house
roof
and
then
turning
suddenly
to
the
strangers
you
he
bellowed
off
out
of
that
the
clerk
and
herrick
stood
not
on
the
order
of
their
going
but
fled
incontinently
by
the
plank
the
performer
on
the
other
hand
flung
down
the
instrument
and
rose
to
his
full
height
slowly
that
you
say
he
said
half
a
mind
to
give
you
a
lesson
in
civility

more
of
your

the
captain
and
then
turning
to
the
crew
you
fellows
he
said
gentlemen
anyway
the
worst
nigger
among
you
would
look
better
upon
a
than
that
filthy
scotchman
captain
tom
scorned
to
reply
he
watched
with
a
hard
smile
the
departure
of
his
guests
and
as
soon
as
the
last
foot
was
off
the
plank
turned
to
the
hands
to
work
cargo
the
beachcombers
beat
their
inglorious
retreat
along
the
shore
herrick
first
his
face
dark
with
blood
his
knees
trembling
under
him
with
the
hysteria
of
rage
presently
under
the
same
purao
where
they
had
shivered
the
night
before
he
cast
himself
down
and
groaned
aloud
and
ground
his
face
into
the
sand
speak
to
me
do
speak
to
me
i
ca
stand
it
broke
from
him
the
other
two
stood
over
him
perplexed
ca
he
stand
now
said
the
clerk
he
a
meal
lickin
my
lips
herrick
reared
up
his
wild
eyes
and
burning
face
ca
beg
he
screamed
and
again
threw
himself
prone
thing
got
to
come
to
an
end
said
the
captain
with
an
intake
of
the
breath
like
signs
of
an
end
do
it
sneered
the
clerk
not
so
far
from
it
and
do
you
deceive
yourself
replied
the
captain
he
added
in
a
livelier
voice
fellows
hang
on
here
and
i
go
and
interview
my
representative
whereupon
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
set
off
at
a
swinging
sailor
walk
towards
papeete
it
was
some
half
hour
later
when
he
returned
the
clerk
was
dozing
with
his
back
against
the
tree
herrick
still
lay
where
he
had
flung
himself
nothing
showed
whether
he
slept
or
waked
boys
cried
the
captain
with
that
artificial
heartiness
of
his
which
was
at
times
so
painful
a
new
idea
and
he
produced
note
paper
stamped
envelopes
and
pencils
three
of
each
can
all
write
home
by
the
mail
brigantine
the
consul
says
i
can
come
over
to
his
place
and
ink
up
the
addresses
that
a
start
too
said
the
clerk
never
thought
of
that
was
that
yarning
last
night
about
going
home
that
put
me
up
to
it
said
the
captain
over
said
the
clerk
a
shy
and
he
retired
a
little
distance
to
the
shade
of
a
canoe
the
others
remained
under
the
purao
now
they
would
write
a
word
or
two
now
scribble
it
out
now
they
would
sit
biting
at
the
pencil
end
and
staring
seaward
now
their
eyes
would
rest
on
the
clerk
where
he
sat
propped
on
the
canoe
leering
and
coughing
his
pencil
racing
glibly
on
the
paper
ca
do
it
said
herrick
suddenly
have
got
the
heart
here
said
the
captain
speaking
with
unwonted
gravity
may
be
hard
to
write
and
to
write
lies
at
that
and
god
knows
it
is
but
the
square
thing
it
do
cost
anything
to
say
you
well
and
happy
and
sorry
you
ca
make
a
remittance
this
mail
and
if
you
do
tell
you
what
i
think
it
is
i
think
it
about
the
mark
of
being
a
brute
beast
easy
to
talk
said
herrick
do
seem
to
have
written
much
yourself
i
notice
do
you
bring
in
me
for
broke
from
the
captain
his
voice
was
indeed
scarce
raised
above
a
whisper
but
emotion
clanged
in
it
do
you
know
about
me
if
you
had
commanded
the
finest
barque
that
ever
sailed
from
portland
if
you
had
been
drunk
in
your
berth
when
she
struck
the
breakers
in
fourteen
island
group
and
had
had
the
wit
to
stay
there
and
drown
but
came
on
deck
and
given
drunken
orders
and
lost
six
lives
i
could
understand
your
talking
then
there
he
said
more
quietly
my
yarn
and
now
you
know
it
it
a
pretty
one
for
the
father
of
a
family
five
men
and
a
woman
murdered
yes
there
was
a
woman
on
board
and
had
no
business
to
be
either
guess
i
sent
her
to
hell
if
there
is
such
a
place
i
never
dared
go
home
again
and
the
wife
and
the
little
ones
went
to
england
to
her
father
place
i
do
know
what
come
to
them
he
added
with
a
bitter
shrug
you
captain
said
herrick
never
liked
you
better
they
shook
hands
short
and
hard
with
eyes
averted
tenderness
swelling
in
their
bosoms
boys
to
work
again
at
lying
said
the
captain
give
my
father
up
returned
herrick
with
a
writhen
smile
try
my
sweetheart
instead
for
a
change
of
evils
and
here
is
what
he
wrote
i
have
scratched
out
the
beginning
to
my
father
for
i
think
i
can
write
more
easily
to
you
this
is
my
last
farewell
to
all
the
last
you
will
ever
hear
or
see
of
an
unworthy
friend
and
son
i
have
failed
in
life
i
am
quite
broken
down
and
disgraced
i
pass
under
a
false
name
you
will
have
to
tell
my
father
that
with
all
your
kindness
it
is
my
own
fault
i
know
had
i
chosen
that
i
might
have
done
well
and
yet
i
swear
to
you
i
tried
to
choose
i
could
not
bear
that
you
should
think
i
did
not
try
for
i
loved
you
all
you
must
never
doubt
me
in
that
you
least
of
all
i
have
always
unceasingly
loved
but
what
was
my
love
worth
and
what
was
i
worth
i
had
not
the
manhood
of
a
common
clerk
i
could
not
work
to
earn
you
i
have
lost
you
now
and
for
your
sake
i
could
be
glad
of
it
when
you
first
came
to
my
father
house
do
you
remember
those
days
i
want
you
to
you
saw
the
best
of
me
then
all
that
was
good
in
me
do
you
remember
the
day
i
took
your
hand
and
would
not
let
it
go
and
the
day
on
battersea
bridge
when
we
were
looking
at
a
barge
and
i
began
to
tell
you
one
of
my
silly
stories
and
broke
off
to
say
i
loved
you
that
was
the
beginning
and
now
here
is
the
end
when
you
have
read
this
letter
you
will
go
round
and
kiss
them
all
my
father
and
mother
and
the
children
one
by
one
and
poor
uncle
and
tell
them
all
to
forget
me
and
forget
me
yourself
turn
the
key
in
the
door
let
no
thought
of
me
return
be
done
with
the
poor
ghost
that
pretended
he
was
a
man
and
stole
your
love
scorn
of
myself
grinds
in
me
as
i
write
i
should
tell
you
i
am
well
and
happy
and
want
for
nothing
i
do
not
exactly
make
money
or
i
should
send
a
remittance
but
i
am
well
cared
for
have
friends
live
in
a
beautiful
place
and
climate
such
as
we
have
dreamed
of
together
and
no
pity
need
be
wasted
on
me
in
such
places
you
understand
it
is
easy
to
live
and
live
well
but
often
hard
to
make
sixpence
in
money
explain
this
to
my
father
he
will
understand
i
have
no
more
to
say
only
linger
going
out
like
an
unwilling
guest
god
in
heaven
bless
you
think
of
me
to
the
last
here
on
a
bright
beach
the
sky
and
sea
immoderately
blue
and
the
great
breakers
roaring
outside
on
a
barrier
reef
where
a
little
isle
sits
green
with
palms
i
am
well
and
strong
it
is
a
more
pleasant
way
to
die
than
if
you
were
crowding
about
me
on
a
and
yet
i
am
dying
this
is
my
last
kiss
forgive
forget
the
unworthy
so
far
he
had
written
his
paper
was
all
filled
when
there
returned
a
memory
of
evenings
at
the
piano
and
that
song
the
masterpiece
of
love
in
which
so
many
have
found
the
expression
of
their
dearest
thoughts
o
wunder
he
added
more
was
not
required
he
knew
that
in
his
love
heart
the
context
would
spring
up
escorted
with
fair
images
and
harmony
of
how
all
through
life
her
name
should
tremble
in
his
ears
her
name
be
everywhere
repeated
in
the
sounds
of
nature
and
when
death
came
and
he
lay
dissolved
her
memory
lingered
and
thrilled
among
his
elements
o
wonder
once
from
the
ashes
of
my
heart
arose
a
blossom
herrick
and
the
captain
finished
their
letters
about
the
same
time
each
was
breathing
deep
and
their
eyes
met
and
were
averted
as
they
closed
the
envelopes
i
write
so
big
said
the
captain
gruffly
all
of
a
rush
when
it
did
come
here
said
herrick
could
have
done
with
a
ream
when
i
got
started
but
it
long
enough
for
all
the
good
i
had
to
say
they
were
still
at
the
addresses
when
the
clerk
strolled
up
smirking
and
twirling
his
envelope
like
a
man
well
pleased
he
looked
over
herrick
shoulder
he
said
ai
writing
am
though
said
herrick
lives
with
my
father
oh
i
see
what
you
mean
he
added
real
name
is
herrick
no
more
hay
they
had
both
used
the
same
alias
more
hay
than
yours
i
dare
say
bowled
in
the
middle
stump
laughed
the
clerk
name
if
you
want
to
know
everybody
has
a
false
nyme
in
the
pacific
lay
you
five
to
three
the
captain
i
have
too
replied
the
captain
i
never
told
my
own
since
the
day
i
tore
the
title
page
out
of
my
bowditch
and
flung
the
damned
thing
into
the
sea
but
i
tell
it
to
you
boys
john
davis
is
my
name
i
davis
of
the
sea
ranger
you
are
said
hush
what
was
she
a
pirate
or
a
slyver
was
the
fastest
barque
out
of
portland
maine
replied
the
captain
for
the
way
i
lost
her
i
might
as
well
have
bored
a
hole
in
her
side
with
an
auger
you
lost
her
did
you
said
the
clerk
she
was
insured
no
answer
being
returned
to
this
sally
huish
still
brimming
over
with
vanity
and
conversation
struck
into
another
subject
a
good
mind
to
read
you
my
letter
said
he
a
good
fist
with
a
pen
when
i
choose
and
this
is
a
prime
lark
she
was
a
barmaid
i
ran
across
in
northampton
she
was
a
spanking
fine
piece
no
end
of
style
and
we
cottoned
at
first
sight
like
parties
in
the
play
i
suppose
i
spent
the
chynge
of
a
fiver
on
that
girl
well
i
to
remember
her
nyme
so
i
wrote
to
her
and
told
her
i
had
got
rich
and
married
a
queen
in
the
hislands
and
lived
in
a
blooming
palace
such
a
sight
of
crammers
i
must
read
you
one
bit
about
my
opening
the
nigger
parliament
in
a
cocked
it
really
prime
the
captain
jumped
to
his
feet
what
you
did
with
the
paper
that
i
went
and
begged
for
you
he
roared
it
was
perhaps
lucky
for
huish
it
was
surely
in
the
end
unfortunate
for
all
that
he
was
seized
just
then
by
one
of
his
prostrating
accesses
of
cough
his
comrades
would
have
else
deserted
him
so
bitter
was
their
resentment
when
the
fit
had
passed
the
clerk
reached
out
his
hand
picked
up
the
letter
which
had
fallen
to
the
earth
and
tore
it
into
fragments
stamp
and
all
that
satisfy
you
he
asked
sullenly
say
no
more
about
it
replied
davis
chapter
the
old
calaboose
destiny
at
the
door
the
old
calaboose
in
which
the
waifs
had
so
long
harboured
is
a
low
rectangular
enclosure
of
building
at
the
corner
of
a
shady
western
avenue
and
a
little
townward
of
the
british
consulate
within
was
a
grassy
court
littered
with
wreckage
and
the
traces
of
vagrant
occupation
six
or
seven
cells
opened
from
the
court
the
doors
that
had
once
been
locked
on
mutinous
whalermen
rotting
before
them
in
the
grass
no
mark
remained
of
their
old
destination
except
the
rusty
bars
upon
the
windows
the
floor
of
one
of
the
cells
had
been
a
little
cleared
a
bucket
the
last
remaining
piece
of
furniture
of
the
three
caitiffs
stood
full
of
water
by
the
door
a
half
cocoanut
shell
beside
it
for
a
drinking
cup
and
on
some
ragged
ends
of
mat
huish
sprawled
asleep
his
mouth
open
his
face
deathly
the
glow
of
the
tropic
afternoon
the
green
of
sunbright
foliage
stared
into
that
shady
place
through
door
and
window
and
herrick
pacing
to
and
fro
on
the
coral
floor
sometimes
paused
and
laved
his
face
and
neck
with
tepid
water
from
the
bucket
his
long
arrears
of
suffering
the
night
vigil
the
insults
of
the
morning
and
the
harrowing
business
of
the
letter
had
strung
him
to
that
point
when
pain
is
almost
pleasure
time
shrinks
to
a
mere
point
and
death
and
life
appear
indifferent
to
and
fro
he
paced
like
a
caged
brute
his
mind
whirling
through
the
universe
of
thought
and
memory
his
eyes
as
he
went
skimming
the
legends
on
the
wall
the
crumbling
whitewash
was
all
full
of
them
tahitian
names
and
french
and
english
and
rude
sketches
of
ships
under
sail
and
men
at
fisticuffs
it
came
to
him
of
a
sudden
that
he
too
must
leave
upon
these
walls
the
memorial
of
his
passage
he
paused
before
a
clean
space
took
the
pencil
out
and
pondered
vanity
so
hard
to
dislodge
awoke
in
him
we
call
it
vanity
at
least
perhaps
unjustly
rather
it
was
the
bare
sense
of
his
existence
prompted
him
the
sense
of
his
life
the
one
thing
wonderful
to
which
he
scarce
clung
with
a
finger
from
his
jarred
nerves
there
came
a
strong
sentiment
of
coming
change
whether
good
or
ill
he
could
not
say
change
he
knew
no
more
change
with
inscrutable
veiled
face
approaching
noiseless
with
the
feeling
came
the
vision
of
a
concert
room
the
rich
hues
of
instruments
the
silent
audience
and
the
loud
voice
of
the
symphony
knocking
at
the
door
he
thought
drew
a
stave
on
the
plaster
and
wrote
in
the
famous
phrase
from
the
fifth
symphony
thought
he
will
know
that
i
loved
music
and
had
classical
tastes
they
he
i
suppose
the
unknown
kindred
spirit
that
shall
come
some
day
and
read
my
memor
querela
ha
he
shall
have
latin
too
and
he
added
terque
quaterque
beati
queis
ante
ora
patrum
he
turned
again
to
his
uneasy
pacing
but
now
with
an
irrational
and
supporting
sense
of
duty
done
he
had
dug
his
grave
that
morning
now
he
had
carved
his
epitaph
the
folds
of
the
toga
were
composed
why
should
he
delay
the
insignificant
trifle
that
remained
to
do
he
paused
and
looked
long
in
the
face
of
the
sleeping
huish
drinking
disenchantment
and
distaste
of
life
he
nauseated
himself
with
that
vile
countenance
could
the
thing
continue
what
bound
him
now
had
he
no
rights
only
the
obligation
to
go
on
without
discharge
or
furlough
bearing
the
unbearable
ich
trage
unertragliches
the
quotation
rose
in
his
mind
he
repeated
the
whole
piece
one
of
the
most
perfect
of
the
most
perfect
of
poets
and
a
phrase
struck
him
like
a
blow
du
stolzes
herz
a
hast
es
ja
gewolit
where
was
the
pride
of
his
heart
and
he
raged
against
himself
as
a
man
bites
on
a
sore
tooth
in
a
heady
sensuality
of
scorn
have
no
pride
i
have
no
heart
no
manhood
he
thought
why
should
i
prolong
a
life
more
shameful
than
the
gallows
or
why
should
i
have
fallen
to
it
no
pride
no
capacity
no
force
not
even
a
bandit
and
to
be
starving
here
with
worse
than
banditti
with
this
trivial
his
rage
against
his
comrade
rose
and
flooded
him
and
he
shook
a
trembling
fist
at
the
sleeper
a
swift
step
was
audible
the
captain
appeared
upon
the
threshold
of
the
cell
panting
and
flushed
and
with
a
foolish
face
of
happiness
in
his
arms
he
carried
a
loaf
of
bread
and
bottles
of
beer
the
pockets
of
his
coat
were
bulging
with
cigars
he
rolled
his
treasures
on
the
floor
grasped
herrick
by
both
hands
and
crowed
with
laughter
the
beer
he
shouted
the
beer
and
glory
hallelujah
repeated
huish
struggling
to
his
feet

cried
davis
and
plenty
of
it
any
number
of
persons
can
use
it
like
lyon
with
perfect
propriety
and
neatness
who
to
officiate
me
alone
for
that
said
the
clerk
he
knocked
the
necks
off
with
a
lump
of
coral
and
each
drank
in
succession
from
the
shell
a
weed
said
davis
all
in
the
bill
is
up
asked
herrick
the
captain
fell
suddenly
grave
coming
to
that
said
he

to
speak
with
herrick
here

hay
or
huish
or
whatever
your
name

purao

that
ai
the
ticket

son

captain

any
mistake
about
it
if
you
going
to
make
trouble
you
can
have
it
your
own
way
and
stop
right
here
only
get
the
thing
right
if
herrick
and
i
go

take
the
beer
savvy
i
do
want
to

my
oar
in

huish

right
enough

me
the
swipes
you
can
jaw
till
you
blue
in
the
face
for
what
i
care
i
do
think
it
the
friendly
touch
that
all
and
he
shambled
grumbling
out
of
the
cell
into
the
staring
sun
the
captain
watched
him
clear
of
the
courtyard
then
turned
to
herrick
is
it
asked
herrick
thickly
tell
you
said
davis
want
to
consult
you
it
a
chance
got
what
that
he
cried
pointing
to
the
music
on
the
wall
said
the
other
that
it
music
it
a
phrase
of
beethoven
i
was
writing
up
it
means
destiny
knocking
at
the
door
it
said
the
captain
rather
low
and
he
went
near
and
studied
the
inscription
this
french
he
asked
pointing
to
the
latin
it
just
means
i
should
have
been
luckier
if
i
had
died
at
horne
returned
herrick
impatiently
is
this
business
knocking
at
the
door
repeated
the
captain
and
then
looking
over
his
shoulder
mr
herrick
that
about
what
it
comes
to
he
added
do
you
mean
explain
yourself
said
herrick
but
the
captain
was
again
staring
at
the
music
how
long
ago
since
you
wrote
up
this
truck
he
asked
does
it
matter
exclaimed
herrick
dare
say
half
an
hour
god
it
strange
cried
davis
some
men
would
call
that
accidental
not
me
that
and
he
drew
his
thick
finger
under
the
music
what
i
call
providence
said
we
had
a
chance
said
herrick
sir
said
the
captain
wheeling
suddenly
face
to
face
with
his
companion
did
so
if
you
the
man
i
take
you
for
we
have
a
chance
do
know
what
you
take
me
for
was
the
reply
can
scarce
take
me
too
low
hands
mr
herrick
said
the
captain
know
you
you
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
spirit
i
did
want
to
speak
before
that
bummer
there
you
see
why
but
to
you
i
rip
it
right
out
i
got
a
ship
ship
cried
herrick
ship
schooner
we
saw
this
morning
off
the
passage

the
hospital
flag

hooker
said
davis
the
farallone
hundred
and
sixty
tons
register
out
of

sydney
in
california
champagne
captain
mate
and
one
hand
all
died
of
the
smallpox
same
as
they
had
round
in
the
paumotus
i
guess
captain
and
mate
were
the
only
white
men
all
the
hands
kanakas
seems
a
queer
kind
of
outfit
from
a
christian
port
three
of
them
left
and
a
cook
did
know
where
they
were
i
ca
think
where
they
were
either
if
you
come
to
that
wiseman
must
have
been
on
the
booze
i
guess
to
sail
the
course
he
did
however
there
he
was
dead
and
here
are
the
kanakas
as
good
as
lost
they
bummed
around
at
sea
like
the
babes
in
the
wood
and
tumbled
upon
tahiti
the
consul
here
took
charge
he
offered
the
berth
to
williams
williams
had
never
had
the
smallpox
and
backed
down
that
was
when
i
came
in
for
the
letter
paper
i
thought
there
was
something
up
when
the
consul
asked
me
to
look
in
again
but
i
never
let
on
to
you
fellows
so
you
not
be
disappointed
consul
tried
scared
of
smallpox
he
tried
capirati
that
corsican
and
leblue
or
whatever
his
name
is
would
lay
a
hand
on
it
all
too
fond
of
their
sweet
lives
last
of
all
when
there
was
nobody
else
left
to
offer
it
to
he
offers
it
to
me
brown
will
you
ship
captain
and
take
her
to

he

that
what

says
the
consul
and
you
can
count
yourself
damned
lucky
brown

he
and
he
said
it
pretty
too
however
that
all

i
ship
huish
before
the
mast
of

i
let
him

a
landsman

herrick

the
captain

rotting
on
the
beach

that
sort
old
man
and

shipmates

i
ca
refuse
said
herrick
knows
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
all
right
said
the
captain
it
ai
all
he
turned
aside
to
light
a
cigar
else
is
there
asked
the
other
with
a
pang
of
undefinable
alarm
coming
to
that
said
davis
and
then
paused
a
little
here
he
began
holding
out
his
cigar
between
his
finger
and
thumb
you
figure
up
what
this
amount
to
you
do
catch
on
well
we
get
two
months
advance
we
ca
get
away
from
papeete
our
creditors
would
let
us
go
for
less
it
take
us
along
about
two
months
to
get
to
sydney
and
when
we
get
there
i
just
want
to
put
it
to
you
squarely
what
the
better
are
we
off
the
beach
at
least
said
herrick
guess
there
a
beach
at
sydney
returned
the
captain
tell
you
one
thing
mr
herrick
i
do
mean
to
try
no
sir
sydney
will
never
see
me
out
plain
said
herrick
dutch
replied
the
captain
going
to
own
that
schooner
it
nothing
new
it
done
every
year
in
the
pacific
stephens
stole
a
schooner
the
other
day
did
he
hayes
and
pease
stole
vessels
all
the
time
and
it
the
making
of
the
crowd
of
us
see
here
you
think
of
that
cargo
champagne
why
it
like
as
if
it
was
put
up
on
purpose
in
peru
we
sell
that
liquor
off
at
the
and
the
schooner
after
it
if
we
can
find
a
fool
to
buy
her
and
then
light
out
for
the
mines
if
you
back
me
up
i
stake
my
life
i
carry
it
through
said
herrick
with
a
quailing
voice
do
it
desperate
returned
davis
got
a
chance
i
may
never
get
another
herrick
say
the
word
back
me
up
i
think
we
starved
together
long
enough
for
that
ca
do
it
i
sorry
i
ca
do
it
i
not
fallen
as
low
as
that
said
herrick
deadly
pale
did
you
say
this
morning
said
davis
you
could
beg
it
the
one
thing
or
the
other
my
son
but
this
is
the
jail
cried
herrick
tempt
me
it
the
jail
you
hear
what
the
skipper
said
on
board
that
schooner
pursued
the
captain
i
tell
you
he
talked
straight
the
french
have
let
us
alone
for
a
long
time
it
ca
last
longer
they
got
their
eye
on
us
and
as
sure
as
you
live
in
three
weeks
you
be
in
jail
whatever
you
do
i
read
it
in
the
consul
face
forget
captain
said
the
young
man
is
another
way
i
can
die
and
to
say
truth
i
think
i
should
have
died
three
years
ago
the
captain
folded
his
arms
and
looked
the
other
in
the
face
said
he
you
can
cut
your
throat
that
a
frozen
fact
much
good
may
it
do
you
and
where
do
i
come
in
the
light
of
a
strange
excitement
came
in
herrick
face
of
us
said
he
of
us
together
it
not
possible
you
can
enjoy
this
business
come
and
he
reached
out
a
timid
hand
few
strokes
in
the
lagoon
and
rest
tell
you
herrick
i
tempted
to
answer
you
the
way
the
man
does
in
the
bible
and
say
get
thee
behind
me
satan
said
the
captain
you
think
i
would
go
drown
myself
and
i
got
children
starving
enjoy
it
no
by
god
i
do
not
enjoy
it
but
it
the
row
i
got
to
hoe
and
i
hoe
it
till
i
drop
right
here
i
have
three
of
them
you
see
two
boys
and
the
one
girl
adar
the
trouble
is
that
you
are
not
a
parent
yourself
i
tell
you
herrick
i
love
you
the
man
broke
out
did
take
to
you
at
first
you
were
so
anglified
and
tony
but
i
love
you
now
it
a
man
that
loves
you
stands
here
and
wrestles
with
you
i
ca
go
to
sea
with
the
bummer
alone
it
not
possible
go
drown
yourself
and
there
goes
my
last
chance
the
last
chance
of
a
poor
miserable
beast
earning
a
crust
to
feed
his
family
i
ca
do
nothing
but
sail
ships
and
i
no
papers
and
here
i
get
a
chance
and
you
go
back
on
me
ah
you
no
family
and
that
where
the
trouble
is
have
indeed
said
herrick
i
know
said
the
captain
think
so
but
no
man
got
a
family
till
he
got
children
it
only
the
kids
count
something
about
the
little
shavers
i
ca
talk
of
them
and
if
you
thought
a
cent
about
this
father
that
i
hear
you
talk
of
or
that
sweetheart
you
were
writing
to
this
morning
you
would
feel
like
me
you
would
say
what
matters
laws
and
god
and
that
my
folks
are
hard
up
i
belong
to
them
i
get
them
bread
or
by
god
i
get
them
wealth
if
i
have
to
burn
down
london
for
it
that
what
you
would
say
and
i
tell
you
more
your
heart
is
saying
so
this
living
minute
i
can
see
it
in
your
face
you
thinking
here
poor
friendship
for
the
man
i
starved
along
of
and
as
for
the
girl
that
i
set
up
to
be
in
love
with
here
a
mighty
limp
kind
of
a
love
that
wo
carry
me
as
far
as
any
man
would
go
for
a
demijohn
of
whisky
there
not
much
romance
to
that
love
anyway
it
not
the
kind
they
carry
on
about
in
songbooks
but
what
the
good
of
my
carrying
on
talking
when
it
all
in
your
inside
as
plain
as
print
i
put
the
question
to
you
once
for
all
are
you
going
to
desert
me
in
my
hour
of
need
you
know
if
deserted
you
or
will
you
give
me
your
hand
and
try
a
fresh
deal
and
go
home
as
like
as
not
a
millionaire
say
no
and
god
pity
me
say
yes
and
i
make
the
little
ones
pray
for
you
every
night
on
their
bended
knees
god
bless
mr
herrick
that
what
they
say
one
after
the
other
the
old
girl
sitting
there
holding
stakes
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
the
damned
little
he
broke
off
do
often
rip
out
about
the
kids
he
said
when
i
do
there
something
fetches
loose
said
herrick
faintly
there
nothing
else
prophesy
if
you
like
said
the
captain
with
renewed
vigour
this
because
you
think
yourself
too
honest
and
before
a
month
out
you
be
jailed
for
a
i
give
you
the
word
fair
i
can
see
it
herrick
if
you
ca
you
breaking
down
do
think
if
you
refuse
this
chance
that
you
go
on
doing
the
evangelical
you
about
through
with
your
stock
and
before
you
know
where
you
are
you
be
right
out
on
the
other
side
no
it
either
this
for
you
or
else
it
caledonia
i
bet
you
never
were
there
and
saw
those
white
shaved
men
in
their
dust
clothes
and
straw
hats
prowling
around
in
gangs
in
the
lamplight
at
noumea
they
look
like
wolves
and
they
look
like
preachers
and
they
look
like
the
sick
hulsh
is
a
daisy
to
the
best
of
them
well
there
your
company
waiting
for
you
herrick
and
you
got
to
go
and
that
a
prophecy
and
as
the
man
stood
and
shook
through
his
great
stature
he
seemed
indeed
like
one
in
whom
the
spirit
of
divination
worked
and
might
utter
oracles
herrick
looked
at
him
and
looked
away
it
seemed
not
decent
to
spy
upon
such
agitation
and
the
young
man
courage
sank
talk
of
going
home
he
objected
could
never
do
that
could
said
the
other
brown
could
nor
mr
hay
that
shipped
mate
with
him
could
but
what
that
to
do
with
captain
davis
or
mr
herrick
you
galoot
hayes
had
these
wild
islands
where
he
used
to
call
came
the
next
fainter
objection
have
the
wild
islands
of
peru
retorted
davis
were
wild
enough
for
stephens
no
longer
agone
than
just
last
year
i
guess
they
be
wild
enough
for
us
the
crew
kanakas
come
i
see
you
right
old
man
i
see
you
stand
by
and
the
captain
once
more
offered
his
hand
it
your
own
way
then
said
herrick
do
it
a
strange
thing
for
my
father
son
but
i
do
it
i
stand
by
you
man
for
good
or
evil
bless
you
cried
the
captain
and
stood
silent
he
added
with
a
smile
believe
i
have
died
in
my
tracks
if
said
no
and
herrick
looking
at
the
man
half
believed
so
also
now
we
go
break
it
to
the
bummer
said
davis
wonder
how
he
take
it
said
herrick
jump
at
it
was
the
reply
chapter
the
yellow
flag
the
schooner
farallone
lay
well
out
in
the
jaws
of
the
pass
where
the
terrified
pilot
had
made
haste
to
bring
her
to
her
moorings
and
escape
seen
from
the
beach
through
the
thin
line
of
shipping
two
objects
stood
conspicuous
to
seaward
the
little
isle
on
the
one
hand
with
its
palms
and
the
guns
and
batteries
raised
forty
years
before
in
defence
of
queen
pomare
capital
the
outcast
farallone
upon
the
other
banished
to
the
threshold
of
the
port
rolling
there
to
her
scuppers
and
flaunting
the
as
she
rolled
a
few
sea
birds
screamed
and
cried
about
the
ship
and
within
easy
range
a
guard
boat
hung
off
and
on
and
glittered
with
the
weapons
of
marines
the
exuberant
daylight
and
the
blinding
heaven
of
the
tropics
picked
out
and
framed
the
pictures
a
neat
boat
manned
by
natives
in
uniform
and
steered
by
the
doctor
of
the
port
put
from
shore
towards
three
of
the
afternoon
and
pulled
smartly
for
the
schooner
the
were
heaped
with
sacks
of
flour
onions
and
potatoes
perched
among
which
was
huish
dressed
as
a
foremast
hand
a
heap
of
chests
and
cases
impeded
the
action
of
the
oarsmen
and
in
the
stern
by
the
left
hand
of
the
doctor
sat
herrick
dressed
in
a
fresh
rig
of
slops
his
brown
beard
trimmed
to
a
point
a
pile
of
paper
novels
on
his
lap
and
nursing
the
while
between
his
feet
a
chronometer
for
which
they
had
exchanged
that
of
the
farallone
long
since
run
down
and
the
rate
lost
they
passed
the
guard
boat
exchanging
hails
with
the
mate
in
charge
and
drew
near
at
last
to
the
forbidden
ship
not
a
cat
stirred
there
was
no
speech
of
man
and
the
sea
being
exceeding
high
outside
and
the
reef
close
to
where
the
schooner
lay
the
clamour
of
the
surf
hung
round
her
like
the
sound
of
battle
la
goelette
sang
out
the
doctor
with
his
best
voice
instantly
from
the
house
where
they
had
been
stowing
away
stores
first
davis
and
then
the
ragamuffin
swarthy
crew
made
their
appearance
hay
that
you
said
the
captain
leaning
on
the
rail
the
old
man
to
lay
her
alongside
as
if
she
was
eggs
there
a
hell
of
a
run
of
sea
here
and
his
boat
brittle
the
movement
of
the
schooner
was
at
that
time
more
than
usually
violent
now
she
heaved
her
side
as
high
as
a
deep
sea
steamer
and
showed
the
flashing
of
her
copper
now
she
swung
swiftly
toward
the
boat
until
her
scuppers
gurgled
hope
you
have
sea
legs
observed
the
doctor
will
require
them
indeed
to
board
the
farallone
in
that
exposed
position
where
she
lay
was
an
affair
of
some
dexterity
the
less
precious
goods
were
hoisted
roughly
in
the
chronometer
after
repeated
failures
was
passed
gently
and
successfully
from
hand
to
hand
and
there
remained
only
the
more
difficult
business
of
embarking
huish
even
that
piece
of
dead
weight
shipped
at
eighteen
dollars
and
described
by
the
captain
to
the
consul
as
an
invaluable
man
was
at
last
hauled
on
board
without
mishap
and
the
doctor
with
civil
salutations
took
his
leave
the
three
looked
at
each
other
and
davis
heaved
a
breath
of
relief
let
get
this
chronometer
fixed
said
he
and
led
the
way
into
the
house
it
was
a
fairly
spacious
place
two
staterooms
and
a
pantry
opened
from
the
main
cabin
the
bulkheads
were
painted
white
the
floor
laid
with
waxcloth
no
litter
no
sign
of
life
remained
for
the
effects
of
the
dead
men
had
been
disinfected
and
conveyed
on
shore
only
on
the
table
in
a
saucer
some
sulphur
burned
and
the
fumes
set
them
coughing
as
they
entered
the
captain
peered
into
the
starboard
stateroom
where
the
still
lay
tumbled
in
the
bunk
the
blanket
flung
back
as
they
had
flung
it
back
from
the
disfigured
corpse
before
its
burial
i
told
these
niggers
to
tumble
that
truck
overboard
grumbled
davis
they
were
afraid
to
lay
hands
on
it
well
they
hosed
the
place
out
that
as
much
as
can
be
expected
i
suppose
huish
lay
on
to
these
blankets
you
blooming
well
far
enough
first
said
huish
drawing
back
that
snapped
the
captain
tell
you
my
young
friend
i
think
you
make
a
mistake
i
captain
here
lot
i
care
returned
the
clerk
so
said
davis
you
berth
forward
with
the
niggers
walk
right
out
of
this
cabin
i
dessay
said
huish
any
green
in
my
eye
a
lark
a
lark
now
i
explain
this
business
and
you
see
once
for
all
just
precisely
how
much
lark
there
is
to
it
said
davis
captain
and
i
going
to
be
it
one
thing
of
three
first
you
take
my
orders
here
as
cabin
steward
in
which
case
you
mess
with
us
or
second
you
refuse
and
i
pack
you
forward
and
you
get
as
quick
as
the
word
said
or
third
and
last
i
signal
that
and
send
you
ashore
under
arrest
for
mutiny
of
course
i
would
blow
the
gaff
o
no
replied
the
jeering
huish
who
to
believe
you
my
son
inquired
the
captain
sir
there
ai
no
lark
about
my
captainising
enough
said
up
with
these
blankets
huish
was
no
fool
he
knew
when
he
was
beaten
and
he
was
no
coward
either
for
he
stepped
to
the
bunk
took
the
infected
fairly
in
his
arms
and
carried
them
out
of
the
house
without
a
check
or
tremor
was
waiting
for
the
chance
said
davis
to
herrick
need
do
the
same
with
you
because
you
understand
it
for
yourself
you
going
to
berth
here
asked
herrick
following
the
captain
into
the
stateroom
where
he
began
to
adjust
the
chronometer
in
its
place
at
the
much
replied
he
guess
i
berth
on
deck
i
do
know
as
afraid
but
i
no
immediate
use
for
confluent
smallpox
do
know
that
i
afraid
either
said
herrick
the
thought
of
these
two
men
sticks
in
my
throat
that
captain
and
mate
dying
here
one
opposite
to
the
other
it
grim
i
wonder
what
they
said
last
and
wishart
said
the
captain
mighty
small
potatoes
that
a
thing
a
fellow
figures
out
for
himself
one
way
and
the
real
business
goes
quite
another
perhaps
wiseman
said
here
old
man
fetch
up
the
gin
i
feeling
powerful
and
perhaps
wishart
said
oh
hell
that
grim
enough
said
herrick
so
it
is
said
davis
there
that
chronometer
fixed
and
now
it
about
time
to
up
anchor
and
clear
out
he
lit
a
cigar
and
stepped
on
deck
you
what
your
name
he
cried
to
one
of
the
hands
a
fellow
from
some
far
western
island
and
of
a
darkness
almost
approaching
to
the
african
day
replied
the
man
it
is
said
the
captain
know
we
had
ladies
on
board
well
sally
oblige
me
by
hauling
down
that
rag
there
i
do
the
same
for
you
another
time
he
watched
the
yellow
bunting
as
it
was
eased
past
the
and
handed
down
on
deck
float
no
more
on
this
ship
he
observed
the
people
aft
mr
hay
he
added
speaking
unnecessarily
loud
a
word
to
say
to
them
it
was
with
a
singular
sensation
that
herrick
prepared
for
the
first
time
to
address
a
crew
he
thanked
his
stars
indeed
that
they
were
natives
but
even
natives
he
reflected
might
be
critics
too
quick
for
such
a
novice
as
himself
they
might
perceive
some
lapse
from
that
precise
and
english
which
prevails
on
board
a
ship
it
was
even
possible
they
understood
no
other
and
he
racked
his
brain
and
overhauled
his
reminiscences
of
sea
romance
for
some
appropriate
words
men
tumble
aft
he
said
now
all
hands
aft
they
crowded
in
the
alleyway
like
sheep
they
are
sir
said
herrick
for
some
time
the
captain
continued
to
face
the
stern
then
turned
with
ferocious
suddenness
on
the
crew
and
seemed
to
enjoy
their
shrinking
he
said
twisting
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
toying
with
the
spokes
of
the
wheel
captain
brown
i
command
this
ship
this
is
mr
hay
first
officer
the
other
white
man

cabin
steward
but

his
trick

obeyed
smartly

there
shall
be
no
growling
about
the
kaikai
which
will
be
above
allowance

the
mate

and
tack
on
sir
to
every
order
i
give
you
if
you
smart
and
quick
make
this
ship
comfortable
for
all
hands
he
took
the
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
you
not
he
added
in
a
roaring
voice
make
it
a
floating
hell
now
mr
hay
we
pick
watches
if
you
please
right
said
herrick
will
please
use
sir
when
you
address
me
mr
hay
said
the
captain
take
the
lady
step
to
starboard
sally
and
then
he
whispered
in
herrick
ear
the
old
man
take
you
there
said
herrick
your
name
said
the
captain
that
you
say
oh
no
english
i
have
none
of
your
highway
gibberish
on
my
ship
call
you
old
uncle
ned
because
you
got
no
wool
on
the
top
of
your
head
just
the
place
where
the
wool
ought
to
grow
step
to
port
uncle
do
you
hear
mr
hay
has
picked
you
then
i
take
the
white
man
white

step
to
starboard
now
which
of
you
two
is
the
cook
you
then
mr
hay
takes
your
friend
in
the
blue
dungaree
step
to
port
dungaree
there
we
know
who
we
all
are
dungaree
uncle
ned
sally
day
white
man
and
cook
all
i
guess
and
now
mr
hay
we
up
anchor
if
you
please
heaven
sake
tell
me
some
of
the
words
whispered
herrick
an
hour
later
the
farallone
was
under
all
plain
sail
the
rudder
hard
and
the
cheerfully
clanking
windlass
had
brought
the
anchor
home
clear
sir
cried
herrick
from
the
bow
the
captain
met
her
with
the
wheel
as
she
bounded
like
a
stag
from
her
repose
trembling
and
bending
to
the
puffs
the
guard
boat
gave
a
parting
hail
the
wake
whitened
and
ran
out
the
farallone
was
under
weigh
her
berth
had
been
close
to
the
pass
even
as
she
forged
ahead
davis
slewed
her
for
the
channel
between
the
pier
ends
of
the
reef
the
breakers
sounding
and
whitening
to
either
hand
straight
through
the
narrow
band
of
blue
she
shot
to
seaward
and
the
captain
heart
exulted
as
he
felt
her
tremble
underfoot
and
looking
back
over
the
taffrail
beheld
the
roofs
of
papeete
changing
position
on
the
shore
and
the
island
mountains
rearing
higher
in
the
wake
but
they
were
not
yet
done
with
the
shore
and
the
horror
of
the
yellow
flag
about
midway
of
the
pass
there
was
a
cry
and
a
scurry
a
man
was
seen
to
leap
upon
the
rail
and
throwing
his
arms
over
his
head
to
stoop
and
plunge
into
the
sea
as
she
goes
the
captain
cried
relinquishing
the
wheel
to
huish
the
next
moment
he
was
forward
in
the
midst
of
the
kanakas
belaying
pin
in
hand
else
for
shore
he
cried
and
the
savage
trumpeting
of
his
voice
no
less
than
the
ready
weapon
in
his
hand
struck
fear
in
all
stupidly
they
stared
after
their
escaped
companion
whose
black
head
was
visible
upon
the
water
steering
for
the
land
and
the
schooner
meanwhile
slipt
like
a
racer
through
the
pass
and
met
the
long
sea
of
the
open
ocean
with
a
souse
of
spray
that
i
was
not
to
have
a
pistol
ready
exclaimed
davis
we
go
to
sea
we
ca
help
that
you
have
a
lame
watch
of
it
mr
hay
do
see
how
we
are
to
get
along
said
herrick
to
said
the
captain
more
tahiti
for
me
both
turned
instinctively
and
looked
astern
the
fair
island
was
unfolding
mountain
top
on
mountain
top
eimeo
on
the
port
board
lifted
her
splintered
pinnacles
and
still
the
schooner
raced
to
the
open
sea
cried
the
captain
with
a
gesture
morning
i
danced
for
my
breakfast
like
a
poodle
dog
chapter
the
cargo
of
champagne
the
ship
head
was
laid
to
clear
eimeo
to
the
north
and
the
captain
sat
down
in
the
cabin
with
a
chart
a
ruler
and
an
epitome
a
half
said
he
raising
his
face
from
his
labours
hay
you
have
to
watch
your
dead
reckoning
i
want
every
yard
she
makes
on
every
of
a
course
i
going
to
knock
a
hole
right
straight
through
the
paumotus
and
that
always
a
near
touch
now
if
this
south
east
trade
ever
blew
out
of
the
which
it
do
we
might
hope
to
lie
within
half
a
point
of
our
course
say
we
lie
within
a
point
of
it
that
just
about
weather
fakarava
yes
sir
that
what
we
got
to
do
if
we
tack
for
it
brings
us
through
this
slush
of
little
islands
in
the
cleanest
place
see
and
he
showed
where
his
ruler
intersected
the
labyrinth
of
the
dangerous
archipelago
wish
it
was
night
and
i
could
put
her
about
right
now
we
losing
time
and
easting
well
we
do
our
best
and
if
we
fetch
peru
we
bring
up
to
ecuador
all
one
i
guess
depreciated
dollars
down
and
no
questions
asked
a
remarkable
fine
institootion
the
south
american
don
tahiti
was
already
some
way
astern
the
diadem
rising
from
among
broken
mountains
eimeo
was
already
close
aboard
and
stood
black
and
strange
against
the
golden
splendour
of
the
west
when
the
captain
took
his
departure
from
the
two
islands
and
the
patent
log
was
set
some
twenty
minutes
later
sally
day
who
was
continually
leaving
the
wheel
to
peer
in
at
the
cabin
clock
announced
in
a
shrill
cry
and
the
cook
was
to
be
seen
carrying
the
soup
into
the
cabin
guess
i
sit
down
and
have
a
pick
with
you
said
davis
to
herrick
the
time
i
done
it
be
dark
and
we
clap
the
hooker
on
the
wind
for
south
america
in
the
cabin
at
one
corner
of
the
table
immediately
below
the
lamp
and
on
the
lee
side
of
a
bottle
of
champagne
sat
huish
this
where
did
that
come
from
asked
the
captain
fizz
and
it
came
from
the
if
you
want
to
know
said
huish
and
drained
his
mug
never
do
exclaimed
davis
the
merchant
seaman
horror
of
breaking
into
cargo
showing
incongruously
forth
on
board
that
stolen
ship
was
never
any
good
came
of
games
like
that
byby
said
huish
fellow
would
think
to
him
we
were
on
the
square
and
look
you
put
this
job
up
for
me
you
i
to
go
on
deck
and
steer
while
you
two
sit
and
guzzle
and
i
to
go
by
nickname
and
got
to
call
you
sir
and
well
you
look
here
my
bloke
i
have
fizz
ad
or
it
wo
wash
i
tell
you
that
and
you
know
mighty
well
you
ai
got
any
to
signal
now
davis
was
staggered
give
fifty
dollars
this
had
never
happened
he
said
weakly
it
you
see
returned
huish
some
devilish
good
the
rubicon
was
crossed
without
another
struggle
the
captain
filled
a
mug
and
drank
wish
it
was
beer
he
said
with
a
sigh
there
no
denying
the
genuine
stuff
and
cheap
at
the
money
now
huish
you
clear
out
and
take
your
wheel
the
little
wretch
had
gained
a
point
and
he
was
gay
ay
sir
said
he
and
left
the
others
to
their
meal
soup
exclaimed
the
captain
if
i
thought
i
should
taste
pea
soup
again
herrick
sat
inert
and
silent
it
was
impossible
after
these
months
of
hopeless
want
to
smell
the
rough
sea
victuals
without
lust
and
his
mouth
watered
with
desire
of
the
champagne
it
was
no
less
impossible
to
have
assisted
at
the
scene
between
huish
and
the
captain
and
not
to
perceive
with
sudden
bluntness
the
gulf
where
he
had
fallen
he
was
a
thief
among
thieves
he
said
it
to
himself
he
could
not
touch
the
soup
if
he
had
moved
at
all
it
must
have
been
to
leave
the
table
throw
himself
overboard
and
drown
an
honest
man
said
the
captain
look
sick
old
man
have
a
drop
of
this
the
champagne
creamed
and
bubbled
in
the
mug
its
bright
colour
its
lively
effervescence
seized
his
eye
is
too
late
to
hesitate
he
thought
his
hand
took
the
mug
instinctively
he
drank
with
unquenchable
pleasure
and
desire
of
more
drained
the
vessel
dry
and
set
it
down
with
sparkling
eyes
is
something
in
life
after
all
he
cried
had
forgot
what
it
was
like
yes
even
this
is
worth
while
wine
food
dry
clothes
why
they
worth
dying
worth
hanging
for
captain
tell
me
one
thing
why
are
all
the
poor
folk
it
up
said
the
captain
must
be
damned
good
cried
herrick
something
here
beyond
me
think
of
that
calaboose
suppose
we
were
sent
suddenly
back
he
shuddered
as
though
stung
by
a
convulsion
and
buried
his
face
in
his
clutching
hands
what
wrong
with
you
cried
the
captain
there
was
no
reply
only
herrick
shoulders
heaved
so
that
the
table
was
shaken
some
more
of
this
here
drink
this
i
order
you
to
do
start
crying
when
you
out
of
the
wood
not
crying
said
herrick
raising
his
face
and
showing
his
dry
eyes
worse
than
crying
it
the
horror
of
that
grave
that
escaped
from
now
you
tackle
your
soup
that
fix
you
said
davis
kindly
told
you
you
were
all
broken
up
you
could
have
stood
out
another
week
the
dreadful
part
of
it
cried
herrick
week
and
have
murdered
someone
for
a
dollar
god
and
i
know
that
and
i
still
living
it
some
beastly
dream
quietly
quietly
does
it
my
son
take
your
pea
soup
food
that
what
you
want
said
davis
the
soup
strengthened
and
quieted
herrick
nerves
another
glass
of
wine
and
a
piece
of
pickled
pork
and
fried
banana
completed
what
the
soup
began
and
he
was
able
once
more
to
look
the
captain
in

queer
kind
of
a
first
officer
cried
the
captain

mind

ship

babby

let

college

like

it
in
the
face
and
now
we
go
and
put
her
about
bring
the
slate
we
have
to
start
our
dead
reckoning
right
away
the
distance
run
since
the
departure
was
read
off
the
log
by
the
binnacle
light
and
entered
on
the
slate

the
captain

responded
herrick
clear
forward
asked
davis
clear
sir
cried
the
captain
in
your
slack
as
she
comes
he
called
to
huish
in
your
slack
put
your
back
into
it
keep
your
feet
out
of
the
coils
a
sudden
blow
sent
huish
flat
along
the
deck
and
the
captain
was
in
his
place
yourself
up
and
keep
the
wheel
hard
over
he
roared
wooden
fool
you
wanted
to
get
killed

guess

the
jib
he
cried
a
moment
later
and
then
to
huish
me
the
wheel
again
and
see
if
you
can
coil
that
sheet
but
huish
stood
and
looked
at
davis
with
an
evil
countenance
you
know
you
struck
me
said
he
you
know
i
saved
your
life
returned
the
other
not
deigning
to
look
at
him
his
eyes
travelling
instead
between
the
compass
and
the
sails
would
you
have
been
if
that
boom
had
swung
out
and
you
bundled
in
the
clack
no

we
have
no
more

the
mainsheet
seaport

you
did
i
lucky
for
you
i
did
said
huish
slowly
daresay
there
may
be
somethink
in
that
there
is
he
turned
his
back
elaborately
on
the
captain
and
entered
the
house
where
the
speedy
explosion
of
a
champagne
cork
showed
he
was
attending
to
his
comfort
herrick
came
aft
to
the
captain
is
she
doing
now
he
asked
and
by
a
half
said
davis
about
as
good
as
i
expected
the
hands
think
of
it
said
herrick
they
do
think
they
ai
paid
to
says
the
captain
was
something
wrong
was
there
not
between
you
and
herrick
paused
a
nasty
little
beast
that
a
biter
replied
the
captain
shaking
his
head
so
long
as
you
and
me
hang
in
it
do
matter
herrick
lay
down
in
the
weather
alleyway
the
night
was
cloudless
the
movement
of
the
ship
cradled
him
he
was
oppressed
besides
by
the
first
generous
meal
after
so
long
a
time
of
famine
and
he
was
recalled
from
deep
sleep
by
the
voice
of
davis
singing
out
bells
he
rose
stupidly
and
staggered
aft
where
the
captain
gave
him
the
wheel
the
wind
said
the
captain
comes
a
little
puffy
when
you
get
a
heavy
puff
steal
all
you
can
to
windward
but
keep
her
a
good
full
he
stepped
towards
the
house
paused
and
hailed
the
forecastle
such
a
thing
as
a
concertina
forward
said
he
for
you
uncle
ned
fetch
it
aft
will
you
the
schooner
steered
very
easy
and
herrick
watching
the
sails
was
overpowered
by
drowsiness
a
sharp
report
from
the
cabin
startled
him
a
third
bottle
had
been
opened
and
herrick
remembered
the
sea
ranger
and
fourteen
island
group
presently
the
notes
of
the
accordion
sounded
and
then
the
captain
voice
honey
with
our
pockets
full
of
money
we
will
trip
trip
trip
we
will
trip
it
on
the
quay
and
i
will
dance
with
kate
and
tom
will
dance
with
sall
when
we
all
back
from
south
amerikee
so
it
went
to
its
quaint
air
and
the
watch
below
lingered
and
listened
by
the
forward
door
and
uncle
ned
was
to
be
seen
in
the
moonlight
nodding
time
and
herrick
smiled
at
the
wheel
his
anxieties
a
while
forgotten
song
followed
song
another
cork
exploded
there
were
voices
raised
as
though
the
pair
in
the
cabin
were
in
disagreement
and
presently
it
seemed
the
breach
was
healed
for
it
was
now
the
voice
of
huish
that
struck
up
to
the
captain
accompaniment
in
a
balloon
boys
up
in
a
balloon
all
among
the
little
stars
and
round
about
the
moon
a
wave
of
nausea
overcame
herrick
at
the
wheel
he
wondered
why
the
air
the
words
which
were
yet
written
with
a
certain
knack
and
the
voice
and
accent
of
the
singer
should
all
jar
his
spirit
like
a
file
on
a
man
teeth
he
sickened
at
the
thought
of
his
two
comrades
drinking
away
their
reason
upon
stolen
wine
quarrelling
and
hiccupping
and
waking
up
while
the
doors
of
the
prison
yawned
for
them
in
the
near
future
i
have
sold
my
honour
for
nothing
he
thought
and
a
heat
of
rage
and
resolution
glowed
in
his
bosom
rage
against
his
comrades
resolution
to
carry
through
this
business
if
it
might
be
carried
pluck
profit
out
of
shame
since
the
shame
at
least
was
now
inevitable
and
come
home
home
from
south
america
how
did
the
song
go
his
pockets
full
of
money
honey
with
our
pockets
full
of
money
we
will
trip
trip
trip
we
will
trip
it
on
the
quay
so
the
words
ran
in
his
head
and
the
honey
took
on
visible
form
the
quay
rose
before
him
and
he
knew
it
for
the
lamplit
embankment
and
he
saw
the
lights
of
battersea
bridge
bestride
the
sullen
river
all
through
the
remainder
of
his
trick
he
stood
entranced
reviewing
the
past
he
had
been
always
true
to
his
love
but
not
always
sedulous
to
recall
her
in
the
growing
calamity
of
his
life
she
had
swum
more
distant
like
the
moon
in
mist
the
letter
of
farewell
the
dishonourable
hope
that
had
surprised
and
corrupted
him
in
his
distress
the
changed
scene
the
sea
the
night
and
the
music
all
stirred
him
to
the
roots
of
manhood
will
win
her
he
thought
and
ground
his
teeth
or
foul
what
matters
if
i
win
her
bell
matey
i
think
um
fo
bell
he
was
suddenly
recalled
by
these
words
in
the
voice
of
uncle
ned
in
at
the
clock
uncle
said
he
he
would
not
look
himself
from
horror
of
the
tipplers
past
matey
repeated
the
hawaiian
much
the
better
for
you
uncle
he
replied
and
he
gave
up
the
wheel
repeating
the
directions
as
he
had
received
them
he
took
two
steps
forward
and
remembered
his
dead
reckoning
has
she
been
heading
he
thought
and
he
flushed
from
head
to
foot
he
had
not
observed
or
had
forgotten
here
was
the
old
incompetence
the
slate
must
be
filled
up
by
guess
again
he
vowed
to
himself
in
silent
fury
again
it
shall
be
no
fault
of
mine
if
this
miscarry
and
for
the
remainder
of
his
watch
he
stood
close
by
uncle
ned
and
read
the
face
of
the
compass
as
perhaps
he
had
never
read
a
letter
from
his
sweetheart
all
the
time
and
spurring
him
to
the
more
attention
song
loud
talk
fleering
laughter
and
the
occasional
popping
of
a
cork
reached
his
ears
from
the
interior
of
the
house
and
when
the
port
watch
was
relieved
at
midnight
huish
and
the
captain
appeared
upon
the
with
flushed
faces
and
uneven
steps
the
former
laden
with
bottles
the
latter
with
two
tin
mugs
herrick
silently
passed
them
by
they
hailed
him
in
thick
voices
he
made
no
answer
they
cursed
him
for
a
churl
he
paid
no
heed
although
his
belly
quivered
with
disgust
and
rage
he
the
door
of
the
house
behind
him
and
cast
himself
on
a
locker
in
the
cabin
not
to
sleep
he
thought
rather
to
think
and
to
despair
yet
he
had
scarce
turned
twice
on
his
uneasy
bed
before
a
drunken
voice
hailed
him
in
the
ear
and
he
must
go
on
deck
again
to
stand
the
morning
watch
the
first
evening
set
the
model
for
those
that
were
to
follow
two
cases
of
champagne
scarce
lasted
the
hours
and
almost
the
whole
was
drunk
by
huish
and
the
captain
huish
seemed
to
thrive
on
the
excess
he
was
never
sober
yet
never
wholly
tipsy
the
food
and
the
sea
air
had
soon
healed
him
of
his
disease
and
he
began
to
lay
on
flesh
but
with
davis
things
went
worse
in
the
drooping
unbuttoned
figure
that
sprawled
all
day
upon
the
lockers
tippling
and
reading
novels
in
the
fool
who
made
of
the
evening
watch
a
public
carouse
on
the
it
would
have
been
hard
to
recognise
the
vigorous
seaman
of
papeete
roads
he
kept
himself
reasonably
well
in
hand
till
he
had
taken
the
sun
and
yawned
and
blotted
through
his
calculations
but
from
the
moment
he
rolled
up
the
chart
his
hours
were
passed
in
slavish
or
in
hoggish
slumber
every
other
branch
of
his
duty
was
neglected
except
maintaining
a
stern
discipline
about
the
dinner
table
again
and
again
herrick
would
hear
the
cook
called
aft
and
see
him
running
with
fresh
tins
or
carrying
away
again
a
meal
that
had
been
totally
condemned
and
the
more
the
captain
became
sunk
in
drunkenness
the
more
delicate
his
palate
showed
itself
once
in
the
forenoon
he
had
a
chair
rigged
over
the
rail
stripped
to
his
trousers
and
went
overboard
with
a
pot
of
paint
do
like
the
way
this
schooner
painted
said
he
i
taken
a
down
upon
her
name
but
he
tired
of
it
in
half
an
hour
and
the
schooner
went
on
her
way
with
an
incongruous
patch
of
colour
on
the
stern
and
the
word
farallone
part
obliterated
and
part
looking
through
he
refused
to
stand
either
the
middle
or
the
morning
watch
it
was
sailing
he
said
and
asked
with
a
laugh
ever
heard
of
the
old
man
standing
watch
himself
to
the
dead
reckoning
which
herrick
still
tried
to
keep
he
would
pay
not
the
least
attention
nor
afford
the
least
assistance
do
we
want
of
dead
reckoning
he
asked
get
the
sun
all
right
do
we
may
get
it
always
though
objected
herrick
you
told
me
yourself
you
were
sure
of
the
chronometer
there
ai
no
flies
in
the
chronometer
cried
davis
me
so
far
captain
said
herrick
stiffly
am
anxious
to
keep
this
reckoning
which
is
a
part
of
my
duty
i
do
not
know
what
to
allow
for
current
nor
how
to
allow
for
it
i
am
too
inexperienced
and
i
beg
of
you
to
help
me
discourage
zealous
officer
said
the
captain
unrolling
the
chart
again
for
herrick
had
taken
him
over
his
day
work
and
while
he
was
still
partly
sober
it
is
look
for
yourself
anything
from
west
to
west
and
anyways
from
five
to
miles
that
what
the
chart
says
i
guess
you
do
expect
to
get
on
ahead
of
your
own
britishers
am
trying
to
do
my
duty
captain
brown
said
herrick
with
a
dark
flush
i
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
that
i
do
enjoy
being
trifled
with
in
thunder
do
you
want
roared
davis
and
look
at
the
blamed
wake
if
you
trying
to
do
your
duty
why
do
you
go
and
do
it
i
guess
it
no
business
of
mine
to
go
and
stick
my
head
over
the
rump
i
guess
it
yours
and
i
tell
you
what
it
is
my
fine
fellow
i
trouble
you
not
to
come
the
dude
over
me
you
insolent
what
wrong
with
you
do
you
crowd
me
mr
herrick
esquire
herrick
tore
up
his
papers
threw
them
on
the
floor
and
left
the
cabin
turned
a
bloomin
swot
ai
he
sneered
huish
thinks
himself
too
good
for
his
company
that
what
ails
herrick
esquire
raged
the
captain
thinks
i
do
understand
when
he
comes
the
heavy
swell
wo
sit
down
with
us
wo
he
wo
say
a
civil
word
i
serve
the
son
of
a
gun
as
he
deserves
by
god
huish
show
him
whether
he
too
good
for
john
davis
with
the
names
cap
said
huish
who
was
always
the
more
sober
over
the
stones
my
boy
right
i
will
you
a
good
sort
huish
i
did
take
to
you
at
first
but
i
guess
you
right
enough
let
open
another
bottle
said
the
captain
and
that
day
perhaps
because
he
was
excited
by
the
quarrel
he
drank
more
recklessly
and
by
four
was
stretched
insensible
upon
the
locker
herrick
and
huish
supped
alone
one
after
the
other
opposite
his
flushed
and
snorting
body
and
if
the
sight
killed
herrick
hunger
the
isolation
weighed
so
heavily
on
the
clerk
spirit
that
he
was
scarce
risen
from
table
ere
he
was
currying
favour
with
his
former
comrade
herrick
was
at
the
wheel
when
he
approached
and
huish
leaned
confidentially
across
the
binnacle
say
old
chappie
he
said
and
me
do
seem
to
be
such
pals
somehow
herrick
gave
her
a
spoke
or
two
in
silence
his
eye
as
it
skirted
from
the
needle
to
the
luff
of
the
foresail
passed
the
man
by
without
speculation
but
huish
was
really
dull
a
thing
he
could
support
with
difficulty
having
no
resources
of
his
own
the
idea
of
a
private
talk
with
herrick
at
this
stage
of
their
relations
held
out
particular
inducements
to
a
person
of
his
character
drink
besides
as
it
renders
some
men
made
huish
callous
and
it
would
almost
have
required
a
blow
to
make
him
quit
his
purpose
business
ai
it
he
continued
on
the
lush
must
say
i
thought
you
gave
it
today
he
did
like
it
a
bit
took
on
hawful
after
you
were
says
i
on
easy
on
the
lush
i
says
was
right
and
you
know
it
give
a
chanst
i
uish
sezee
do
you
gim
me
no
more
of
your
jaw
or
knock
your
bloomin
eyes
well
wot
can
i
do
but
i
tell
you
i
do
like
it
it
looks
to
me
like
the
sea
rynger
over
again
still
herrick
was
silent
you
hear
me
speak
asked
huish
sharply
pleasant
you
away
from
that
binnacle
said
herrick
the
clerk
looked
at
him
long
and
straight
and
black
his
figure
seemed
to
writhe
like
that
of
a
snake
about
to
strike
then
he
turned
on
his
heel
went
back
to
the
cabin
and
opened
a
bottle
of
champagne
when
eight
bells
were
cried
he
slept
on
the
floor
beside
the
captain
on
the
locker
and
of
the
whole
starboard
watch
only
sally
day
appeared
upon
the
summons
the
mate
proposed
to
stand
the
watch
with
him
and
let
uncle
ned
lie
down
it
would
make
twelve
hours
on
deck
and
probably
sixteen
but
in
this
sailing
he
might
safely
sleep
between
his
tricks
of
wheel
leaving
orders
to
be
called
on
any
sign
of
squalls
so
far
he
could
trust
the
men
between
whom
and
himself
a
close
relation
had
sprung
up
with
uncle
ned
he
held
long
nocturnal
conversations
and
the
old
man
told
him
his
simple
and
hard
story
of
exile
suffering
and
injustice
among
cruel
whites
the
cook
when
he
found
herrick
messed
alone
produced
for
him
unexpected
and
sometimes
unpalatable
dainties
of
which
he
forced
himself
to
eat
and
one
day
when
he
was
forward
he
was
surprised
to
feel
a
caressing
hand
run
down
his
shoulder
and
to
hear
the
voice
of
sally
day
crooning
in
his
ear
gootch
man
he
turned
and
choking
down
a
sob
shook
hands
with
the
negrito
they
were
kindly
cheery
childish
souls
upon
the
sunday
each
brought
forth
his
separate
bible
for
they
were
all
men
of
alien
speech
even
to

sally
day
communicated
with
his
mates
in
english
only
each
read
or
made
believe
to
read
his
chapter
uncle
ned
with
spectacles
on
his
nose
and
they
would
all
join
together
in
the
singing
of
missionary
hymns
it
was
thus
a
cutting
reproof
to
compare
the
islanders
and
the
whites
aboard
the
farallone
shame
ran
in
herrick
blood
to
remember
what
employment
he
was
on
and
to
see
these
poor
souls
and
even
sally
day
the
child
of
cannibals
in
all
likelihood
a
cannibal
himself
so
faithful
to
what
they
knew
of
good
the
fact
that
he
was
held
in
grateful
favour
by
these
innocents
served
like
blinders
to
his
conscience
and
there
were
times
when
he
was
inclined
with
sally
day
to
call
himself
a
good
man
but
the
height
of
his
favour
was
only
now
to
appear
with
one
voice
the
crew
protested
ere
herrick
knew
what
they
were
doing
the
cook
was
aroused
and
came
a
willing
volunteer
all
hands
clustered
about
their
mate
with
expostulations
and
caresses
and
he
was
bidden
to
lie
down
and
take
his
customary
rest
without
alarm
tell
you
tlue
said
uncle
ned
sleep
evely
man
hae
he
do
all
light
evely
man
he
like
you
too
much
herrick
struggled
and
gave
way
choked
upon
some
trivial
words
of
gratitude
and
walked
to
the
side
of
the
house
against
which
he
leaned
struggling
with
emotion
uncle
ned
presently
followed
him
and
begged
him
to
lie
down
no
use
uncle
ned
he
replied
could
sleep
i
knocked
over
with
all
your
goodness
no
call
me
uncle
ned
no
mo
cried
the
old
man
my
name
my
name
taveeta
taveeta
king
of
islael
wat
for
he
call
that
hawaii
i
think
no
savvy
nothing
it
was
the
first
time
the
name
of
the
late
captain
had
been
mentioned
and
herrick
grasped
the
occasion
the
reader
shall
be
spared
uncle
unwieldy
dialect
and
learn
in
less
embarrassing
english
the
sum
of
what
he
now
communicated
the
ship
had
scarce
cleared
the
golden
gates
before
the
captain
and
mate
had
entered
on
a
career
of
drunkenness
which
was
scarcely
interrupted
by
their
malady
and
only
closed
by
death
for
days
and
weeks
they
had
encountered
neither
land
nor
ship
and
seeing
themselves
lost
on
the
huge
deep
with
their
insane
conductors
the
natives
had
drunk
deep
of
terror
at
length
they
made
a
low
island
and
went
in
and
wiseman
and
wishart
landed
in
the
boat
there
was
a
great
village
a
very
fine
village
and
plenty
kanakas
in
that
place
but
all
mighty
serious
and
from
every
here
and
there
in
the
back
parts
of
the
settlement
taveeta
heard
the
sounds
of
island
lamentation
no
savvy
talk
that
island
said
he
savvy
hear
um
cly
i
think
hum
too
many
people
die
here
but
upon
wiseman
and
wishart
the
significance
of
that
barbaric
keening
was
lost
full
of
bread
and
drink
they
rollicked
along
unconcerned
embraced
the
girls
who
had
scarce
energy
to
repel
them
took
up
and
joined
with
drunken
voices
in
the
death
wail
and
at
last
on
what
they
took
to
be
an
invitation
entered
under
the
roof
of
a
house
in
which
was
a
considerable
concourse
of
people
sitting
silent
they
stooped
below
the
eaves
flushed
and
laughing
within
a
minute
they
came
forth
again
with
changed
faces
and
silent
tongues
and
as
the
press
severed
to
make
way
for
them
taveeta
was
able
to
perceive
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
house
the
sick
man
raising
from
his
mat
a
head
already
defeatured
by
disease
the
two
tragic
triflers
fled
without
hesitation
for
their
boat
screaming
on
taveeta
to
make
haste
they
came
aboard
with
all
speed
of
oars
raised
anchor
and
crowded
sail
upon
the
ship
with
blows
and
curses
and
were
at
sea
again
and
again
drunk
before
sunset
a
week
after
and
the
last
of
the
two
had
been
committed
to
the
deep
herrick
asked
taveeta
where
that
island
was
and
he
replied
that
by
what
he
gathered
of
folks
talk
as
they
went
up
together
from
the
beach
he
supposed
it
must
be
one
of
the
paumotus
this
was
in
itself
probable
enough
for
the
dangerous
archipelago
had
been
swept
that
year
from
east
to
west
by
devastating
smallpox
but
herrick
thought
it
a
strange
course
to
lie
from
sydney
then
he
remembered
the
drink
they
not
surprised
when
they
made
the
island
he
asked
he
say
dam
what
this
was
the
reply
that
it
then
said
herrick
do
believe
they
knew
where
they
were
think
so
too
said
uncle
ned
think
no
savvy
this
one
betta
he
added
pointing
to
the
house
where
the
drunken
captain
slumbered
the
implied
last
touch
completed
herrick
picture
of
the
life
and
death
of
his
two
predecessors
of
their
prolonged
sordid
sodden
sensuality
as
they
sailed
they
knew
not
whither
on
their
last
cruise
he
held
but
a
twinkling
and
unsure
belief
in
any
future
state
the
thought
of
one
of
punishment
he
derided
yet
for
him
as
for
all
there
dwelt
a
horror
about
the
end
of
the
brutish
man
sickness
fell
upon
him
at
the
image
thus
called
up
and
when
he
compared
it
with
the
scene
in
which
himself
was
acting
and
considered
the
doom
that
seemed
to
brood
upon
the
schooner
a
horror
that
was
almost
superstitious
fell
upon
him
and
yet
the
strange
thing
was
he
did
not
falter
he
who
had
proved
his
incapacity
in
so
many
fields
being
now
falsely
placed
amid
duties
which
he
did
not
understand
without
help
and
it
might
be
said
without
countenance
had
hitherto
surpassed
expectation
and
even
the
shameful
misconduct
and
shocking
disclosures
of
that
night
seemed
but
to
nerve
and
strengthen
him
he
had
sold
his
honour
he
vowed
it
should
not
be
in
vain
shall
be
no
fault
of
mine
if
this
miscarry
he
repeated
and
in
his
heart
he
wondered
at
himself
living
rage
no
doubt
supported
him
no
doubt
also
the
sense
of
the
last
cast
of
the
ships
burned
of
all
doors
closed
but
one
which
is
so
strong
a
tonic
to
the
merely
weak
and
so
deadly
a
depressant
to
the
merely
cowardly
for
some
time
the
voyage
went
otherwise
well
they
weathered
fakarava
with
one
board
and
the
wind
holding
well
to
the
southward
and
blowing
fresh
they
passed
between
ranaka
and
ratiu
and
ran
some
days
by
under
the
lee
of
takume
and
honden
neither
of
which
they
made
in
about
degrees
south
and
between
and
degrees
west
it
fell
a
dead
calm
with
rather
a
heavy
sea
the
captain
refused
to
take
in
sail
the
helm
was
lashed
no
watch
was
set
and
the
farallone
rolled
and
banged
for
three
days
according
to
observation
in
almost
the
same
place
the
fourth
morning
a
little
before
day
a
breeze
sprang
up
and
rapidly
freshened
the
captain
had
drunk
hard
the
night
before
he
was
far
from
sober
when
he
was
roused
and
when
he
came
on
deck
for
the
first
time
at
eight
it
was
plain
he
had
already
drunk
deep
again
at
breakfast
herrick
avoided
his
eye
and
resigned
the
deck
with
indignation
to
a
man
more
than
over
by
the
loud
commands
of
the
captain
and
the
singing
out
of
fellows
at
the
ropes
he
could
judge
from
the
house
that
sail
was
being
crowded
on
the
ship
relinquished
his
breakfast
and
came
on
deck
again
to
find
the
main
and
the
jib
topsails
set
and
both
watches
and
the
cook
turned
out
to
hand
the
staysail
the
farallone
lay
already
far
over
the
sky
was
obscured
with
misty
scud
and
from
the
windward
an
ominous
squall
came
flying
up
broadening
and
blackening
as
it
rose
fear
thrilled
in
herrick
vitals
he
saw
death
hard
by
and
if
not
death
sure
ruin
for
if
the
farallone
lived
through
the
coming
squall
she
must
surely
be
dismasted
with
that
their
enterprise
was
at
an
end
and
they
themselves
bound
prisoners
to
the
very
evidence
of
their
crime
the
greatness
of
the
peril
and
his
own
alarm
sufficed
to
silence
him
pride
wrath
and
shame
raged
without
issue
in
his
mind
and
he
shut
his
teeth
and
folded
his
arms
close
the
captain
sat
in
the
boat
to
windward
bellowing
orders
and
insults
his
eyes
glazed
his
face
deeply
congested
a
bottle
set
between
his
knees
a
glass
in
his
hand
half
empty
his
back
was
to
the
squall
and
he
was
at
first
intent
upon
the
setting
of
the
sail
when
that
was
done
and
the
great
trapezium
of
canvas
had
begun
to
draw
and
to
trail
the
of
the
farallone
level
with
the
foam
he
laughed
out
an
empty
laugh
drained
his
glass
sprawled
back
among
the
lumber
in
the
boat
and
fetched
out
a
crumpled
novel
herrick
watched
him
and
his
indignation
glowed
red
hot
he
glanced
to
windward
where
the
squall
already
whitened
the
near
sea
and
heralded
its
coming
with
a
singular
and
dismal
sound
he
glanced
at
the
steersman
and
saw
him
clinging
to
the
spokes
with
a
face
of
a
sickly
blue
he
saw
the
crew
were
running
to
their
stations
without
orders
and
it
seemed
as
if
something
broke
in
his
brain
and
the
passion
of
anger
so
long
restrained
so
long
eaten
in
secret
burst
suddenly
loose
and
shook
him
like
a
sail
he
stepped
across
to
the
captain
and
smote
his
hand
heavily
on
the
drunkard
shoulder
brute
he
said
in
a
voice
that
tottered
behind
you
that
cried
davis
bounding
in
the
boat
and
upsetting
the
champagne
lost
the
sea
ranger
because
you
were
a
drunken
sot
said
herrick
you
going
to
lose
the
farallone
you
going
to
drown
here
the
same
way
as
you
drowned
others
and
be
damned
and
your
daughter
shall
walk
the
streets
and
your
sons
be
thieves
like
their
father
for
the
moment
the
words
struck
the
captain
white
and
foolish
god
he
cried
looking
at
herrick
as
upon
a
ghost
god
herrick
behind
you
then
reiterated
the
assailant
the
wretched
man
already
partly
sobered
did
as
he
was
told
and
in
the
same
breath
of
time
leaped
to
his
feet
staysail
he
trumpeted
the
hands
were
thrilling
for
the
order
and
the
great
sail
came
with
a
run
and
fell
half
overboard
among
the
racing
foam
let
the
be
he
said
again
but
before
it
was
well
uttered
the
squall
shouted
aloud
and
fell
in
a
solid
mass
of
wind
and
rain
commingled
on
the
farallone
and
she
stooped
under
the
blow
and
lay
like
a
thing
dead
from
the
mind
of
herrick
reason
fled
he
clung
in
the
weather
rigging
exulting
he
was
done
with
life
and
he
gloried
in
the
release
he
gloried
in
the
wild
noises
of
the
wind
and
the
choking
onslaught
of
the
rain
he
gloried
to
die
so
and
now
amid
this
coil
of
the
elements
and
meanwhile
in
the
waist
up
to
his
knees
in
water
so
low
the
schooner
lay
the
captain
was
hacking
at
the
foresheet
with
a
pocket
knife
it
was
a
question
of
seconds
for
the
farallone
drank
deep
of
the
encroaching
seas
but
the
hand
of
the
captain
had
the
advance
the
foresail
boom
tore
apart
the
last
strands
of
the
sheet
and
crashed
to
leeward
the
farallone
leaped
up
into
the
wind
and
righted
and
the
peak
and
throat
halyards
which
had
long
been
let
go
began
to
run
at
the
same
instant
for
some
ten
minutes
more
she
careered
under
the
impulse
of
the
squall
but
the
captain
was
now
master
of
himself
and
of
his
ship
and
all
danger
at
an
end
and
then
sudden
as
a
trick
change
upon
the
stage
the
squall
blew
by
the
wind
dropped
into
light
airs
the
sun
beamed
forth
again
upon
the
tattered
schooner
and
the
captain
having
secured
the
foresail
boom
and
set
a
couple
of
hands
to
the
pump
walked
aft
sober
a
little
pale
and
with
the
sodden
end
of
a
cigar
still
stuck
between
his
teeth
even
as
the
squall
had
found
it
herrick
followed
him
he
could
scarce
recall
the
violence
of
his
late
emotions
but
he
felt
there
was
a
scene
to
go
through
and
he
was
anxious
and
even
eager
to
go
through
with
it
the
captain
turning
at
the
house
end
met
him
face
to
face
and
averted
his
eyes
lost
the
two
and
the
he
gabbled
business
we
did
lose
any
sticks
i
guess
you
think
we
all
the
better
without
the
kites
not
what
i
thinking
said
herrick
in
a
voice
strangely
quiet
that
yet
echoed
confusion
in
the
captain
mind
know
that
he
cried
holding
up
his
hand
know
what
thinking
no
use
to
say
it
now
i
sober
have
to
say
it
though
returned
herrick
on
herrick

davis

would

huish

my
place
he
will
make
a
worthy
first
officer
to
your
captain
sir
he
smiled
bowed
and
turned
to
walk
forward
are
you
going
herrick
cried
the
captain
detaining
him
by
the
shoulder
berth
forward
with
the
men
sir
replied
herrick
with
the
same
hateful
smile
been
long
enough
aft
here

you
gentlemen

said
davis
you

too
quick
with
me
there
ai
nothing

but
the
drink

old
story

me
get
sober
once
and
then
you
see
he
pleaded
me
i
desire
to
see
no
more
of
you
said
herrick
the
captain
groaned
aloud

what
you
said
about
my
children
he
broke
out
rote
in
case
you
wish
me
to
say
it
you
again
asked
herrick
cried
the
captain
clapping
his
hands
to
his
ears
make
me
kill
a
man
i
care
for
herrick
if
you
see
me
put
glass
to
my
lips
again
till

give
you

through
me

back
on

i
always

the
right
of
it
drunk
or
sober
i
knew
that

oath

you
clever
enough
to

that
this
is
earnest
you

no
more
drinking
asked
herrick
by
you
nor
huish
that
you
wo
go
on
stealing
my
profits
and
drinking
my
champagne
that
i
gave
my
honour
for
and
that
you
attend
to
your
duties
and
stand
watch
and
watch
and
bear
your
proper
share
of
the
ship
work
instead
of
leaving
it
all
on
the
shoulders
of
a
landsman
and
making
yourself
the
butt
and
scoff
of
native
seamen
is
that
what
you
mean
if
it
is
be
so
good
as
to
say
it
categorically
put
these
things
in
a
way
hard
for
a
gentleman
to
swallow
said
the
captain
would
have
me
say
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
trust
me
this
once
i
do
the
square
thing
and
there
my
hand
on
it
i
try
it
once
said
herrick
me
again
more
now
interrupted
davis
more
old
man
enough
said
a
riling
tongue
when
your
back
up
herrick
just
be
glad
we
friends
again
the
same
as
what
i
am
and
go
tender
on
the
raws
i
see
as
you
do
repent
it
we
been
mighty
near
death
this
day
do
say
whose
fault
it
was
pretty
near
hell
too
i
guess
we
in
a
mighty
bad
line
of
life
us
two
and
ought
to
go
easy
with
each
other
he
was
maundering
yet
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
maundering
with
some
design
beating
about
the
bush
of
some
communication
that
he
feared
to
make
or
perhaps
only
talking
against
time
in
terror
of
what
herrick
might
say
next
but
herrick
had
now
spat
his
venom
his
was
a
kindly
nature
and
content
with
his
triumph
he
had
now
begun
to
pity
with
a
few
soothing
words
he
sought
to
conclude
the
interview
and
proposed
that
they
should
change
their
clothes
right
yet
said
davis
another
thing
i
want
to
tell
you
first
you
know
what
you
said
about
my
children
i
want
to
tell
you
why
it
hit
me
so
hard
i
kind
of
think
you
feel
bad
about
it
too
about
my
little
adar
you
had
ought
to
have
quite
said
that
but
of
course
i
know
you
did
know
she
she
dead
you
see
davis
cried
herrick
told
me
a
dozen
times
she
was
alive
clear
your
head
man
this
must
be
the
drink
sir
said
davis
dead
died
of
a
bowel
complaint
that
was
when
i
was
away
in
the
brig
oregon
she
lies
in
portland
maine
adar
only
daughter
of
captain
john
davis
and
mariar
his
wife
aged
i
had
a
doll
for
her
on
board
i
never
took
the
paper
that
doll
herrick
it
went
down
the
way
it
was
with
the
sea
ranger
that
day
i
was
damned
the
captain
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
horizon
he
talked
with
an
extraordinary
softness
but
a
complete
composure
and
herrick
looked
upon
him
with
something
that
was
almost
terror
think
i
crazy
neither
resumed
davis
all
the
cold
sense
that
i
know
what
to
do
with
but
i
guess
a
man
that
unhappy
like
a
child
and
this
is
a
kind
of
a
child
game
of
mine
i
never
could
act
up
to
the
truth
you
see
so
i
pretend
and
i
warn
you
square
as
soon
as
we
through
with
this
talk
i
start
in
again
with
the
pretending
only
you
see
she
ca
walk
no
streets
added
the
captain
even
make
out
to
live
and
get
that
doll
herrick
laid
a
tremulous
hand
upon
the
captain
shoulder
do
that
cried
davis
recoiling
from
the
touch
you
see
i
all
broken
up
the
way
it
is
come
along
then
come
along
old
man
you
can
put
your
trust
in
me
right
through
come
along
and
get
dry
clothes
they
entered
the
cabin
and
there
was
huish
on
his
knees
prising
open
a
case
of
champagne
there
cried
the
captain
more
of
that
no
more
drinking
on
this
ship
teetotal
you
inquired
agreeable
about
time
eh
bloomin
nearly
lost
another
ship
i
fancy
he
took
out
a
bottle
and
began
calmly
to
burst
the
wire
with
the
spike
of
a
corkscrew
you
hear
me
speak
cried
davis
suppose
i
do
you
speak
loud
enough
said
huish
trouble
is
that
i
do
care
herrick
plucked
the
captain
sleeve
him
free
now
he
said
had
all
we
want
this
morning
him
have
it
then
said
the
captain
his
last
by
this
time
the
wire
was
open
the
string
was
cut
the
head
of
glided
paper
was
torn
away
and
huish
waited
mug
in
hand
expecting
the
usual
explosion
it
did
not
follow
he
eased
the
cork
with
his
thumb
still
there
was
no
result
at
last
he
took
the
screw
and
drew
it
it
came
out
very
easy
and
with
scarce
a
sound
said
huish
a
bad
bottle
he
poured
some
of
the
wine
into
the
mug
it
was
colourless
and
still
he
smelt
and
tasted
it
wot
this
he
said
water
if
the
voice
of
trumpets
had
suddenly
sounded
about
the
ship
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
the
three
men
in
the
house
could
scarcely
have
been
more
stunned
than
by
this
incident
the
mug
passed
round
each
sipped
each
smelt
of
it
each
stared
at
the
bottle
in
its
glory
of
gold
paper
as
crusoe
may
have
stared
at
the
footprint
and
their
minds
were
swift
to
fix
upon
a
common
apprehension
the
difference
between
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
a
bottle
of
water
is
not
great
between
a
shipload
of
one
or
the
other
lay
the
whole
scale
from
riches
to
ruin
a
second
bottle
was
broached
there
were
two
cases
standing
ready
in
a
stateroom
these
two
were
brought
out
broken
open
and
tested
still
with
the
same
result
the
contents
were
still
colourless
and
tasteless
and
dead
as
the
rain
in
a
beached
said
huish
let
sample
the
hold
said
the
captain
mopping
his
brow
with
a
sweep
and
the
three
stalked
out
of
the
house
grim
and
all
hands
were
turned
out
two
kanakas
were
sent
below
another
stationed
at
a
purchase
and
davis
axe
in
hand
took
his
place
beside
the
coamings
you
going
to
let
the
men
know
whispered
herrick
the
men
said
davis
beyond
that
we
got
to
know
ourselves
three
cases
were
sent
on
deck
and
sampled
in
turn
from
each
bottle
as
the
captain
smashed
it
with
the
axe
the
champagne
ran
bubbling
and
creaming
deeper
ca
you
cried
davis
to
the
kanakas
in
the
hold
the
command
gave
the
signal
for
a
disastrous
change
case
after
case
came
up
bottle
after
bottle
was
burst
and
bled
mere
water
deeper
yet
and
they
came
upon
a
layer
where
there
was
scarcely
so
much
as
the
intention
to
deceive
where
the
cases
were
no
longer
branded
the
bottles
no
longer
wired
or
papered
where
the
fraud
was
manifest
and
stared
them
in
the
face
about
enough
of
this
foolery
said
davis
back
the
cases
in
the
hold
uncle
and
get
the
broken
crockery
overboard
come
with
me
he
added
to
his
and
led
the
way
back
into
the
cabin
chapter
the
partners
each
took
a
side
of
the
fixed
table
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
sat
down
at
it
together
but
now
all
sense
of
incongruity
all
memory
of
differences
was
quite
swept
away
by
the
presence
of
the
common
ruin
said
the
captain
after
a
pause
and
with
very
much
the
air
of
a
chairman
opening
a
sold
huish
broke
out
in
laughter
if
this
ai
the
old
rig
he
cried
dyvis
who
thought
he
had
got
up
so
bloomin
early
in
the
mornin
we
stolen
a
cargo
of
spring
water
oh
my
crikey
and
he
squirmed
with
mirth
the
captain
managed
to
screw
out
a
phantom
smile
old
man
destiny
again
said
he
to
herrick
this
time
i
guess
he
kicked
the
door
right
in
herrick
only
shook
his
head
lord
it
rich
laughed
huish
would
really
be
a
scrumptious
lark
if
it
to
somebody
else
and
wot
are
we
to
do
next
oh
my
eye
with
this
bloomin
schooner
too
the
trouble
said
davis
only
one
thing
certain
no
use
carting
this
old
glass
and
ballast
to
peru
no
sir
we
in
a
hole
my
and
the
merchand
cried
huish
man
that
made
this
shipment
he
get
the
news
by
the
mail
brigantine
and
he
think
of
course
we
making
straight
for
sydney
he
be
a
sick
merchant
said
the
captain
thing
this
explains
the
kanaka
crew
if
you
going
to
lose
a
ship
i
would
ask
no
better
myself
than
a
kanaka
crew
but
there
one
thing
it
explain
it
do
explain
why
she
came
down
tahiti
ways
to
lose
her
you
byby
said
huish
lot
you
know
said
the
captain
wants
to
lose
a
schooner
they
want
to
lose
her
on
her
course
you
skeericks
you
seem
to
think
underwriters
have
got
enough
sense
to
come
in
out
of
the
rain
said
herrick
can
tell
you
i
am
afraid
why
she
came
so
far
to
the
eastward
i
had
it
of
uncle
ned
it
seems
these
two
unhappy
devils
wiseman
and
wishart
were
drunk
on
the
champagne
from
the
beginning
and
died
drunk
at
the
end
the
captain
looked
on
the
table
lay
in
their
two
bunks
or
sat
here
in
this
damned
house
he
pursued
with
rising
agitation
their
skins
with
the
accursed
stuff
till
sickness
took
them
as
they
sickened
and
the
fever
rose
they
drank
the
more
they
lay
here
howling
and
groaning
drunk
and
dying
all
in
one
they
did
know
where
they
were
they
did
care
they
did
even
take
the
sun
it
seems
take
the
sun
cried
the
captain
looking
up
billy
what
a
crowd
it
do
matter
to
joe
said
huish
are
wiseman
and
the
buffer
to
us
good
deal
too
says
the
captain
their
heirs
i
guess
is
a
great
inheritance
said
herrick
i
do
know
about
that
returned
davis
to
me
as
if
it
might
be
worse
worth
what
the
cargo
would
have
been
of
course
at
least
not
money
down
but
i
tell
you
what
it
appears
to
figure
up
to
appears
to
me
as
if
it
amounted
to
about
the
bottom
dollar
of
the
man
in
on
said
huish
a
fellow
time
this
umpire
my
sons
pursued
the
captain
who
seemed
to
have
recovered
his
assurance
and
wishart
were
to
be
paid
for
casting
away
this
old
schooner
and
its
cargo
we
going
to
cast
away
the
schooner
right
enough
and
i
make
it
my
private
business
to
see
that
we
get
paid
what
were
and
to
get
that
i
can
tell
but
and
went
into
this
business
themselves
they
were
on
the
crook
now
we
on
the
square
we
only
stumbled
into
it
and
that
merchant
has
just
got
to
squeal
and
i
the
man
to
see
that
he
squeals
good
no
sir
some
stuffing
to
this
farallone
racket
after
all
it
cap
cried
huish
forrard
there
your
style
for
the
money
blow
me
if
i
do
prefer
this
to
the
hother
do
not
understand
said
herrick
have
to
ask
you
to
excuse
me
i
do
not
understand
now
see
here
herrick
said
davis
going
to
have
a
word
with
you
anyway
upon
a
different
matter
and
it
good
that
huish
should
hear
it
too
we
done
with
this
boozing
business
and
we
ask
your
pardon
for
it
right
here
and
now
we
have
to
thank
you
for
all
you
did
for
us
while
we
were
making
hogs
of
ourselves
you
find
me
all
right
in
future
and
as
for
the
wine
which
i
grant
we
stole
from
you
i
take
stock
and
see
you
paid
for
it
that
good
enough
i
believe
but
what
i
want
to
point
out
to
you
is
this
the
old
game
was
a
risky
game
the
new
game
as
safe
as
running
a
vienna
bakery
we
just
put
this
farallone
before
the
wind
and
run
till
we
well
to
looard
of
our
port
of
departure
and
reasonably
well
up
with
some
other
place
where
they
have
an
american
consul
down
goes
the
farallone
and
to
her
a
day
or
so
in
the
boat
the
consul
packs
us
home
at
uncle
sam
expense
to
and
if
that
merchant
do
put
the
dollars
down
you
come
to
me
i
thought
began
herrick
and
then
broke
out
let
get
on
to
peru
if
you
going
to
peru
for
your
health
i
wo
say
no
replied
the
captain
for
what
other
blame
shadow
of
a
reason
you
should
want
to
go
there
gets
me
clear
we
do
want
to
go
there
with
this
cargo
i
do
know
as
old
bottles
is
a
lively
article
anywheres
leastways
i
go
my
bottom
cent
it
ai
peru
it
was
always
a
doubt
if
we
could
sell
the
schooner
i
never
rightly
hoped
to
and
now
sure
she
ai
worth
a
hill
of
beans
what
wrong
with
her
i
know
i
only
know
it
something
or
she
would
be
here
with
this
truck
in
her
inside
then
again
if
we
lose
her
and
land
in
peru
where
are
we
we
ca
declare
the
loss
or
how
did
we
get
to
peru
in
that
case
the
merchant
ca
touch
the
insurance
most
likely
he
go
bust
and
do
you
think
you
see
the
three
of
us
on
the
beach
of
callao
no
extradition
there
said
herrick
my
son
and
we
want
to
be
extraded
said
the
captain
our
point
we
want
to
have
a
consul
extrade
us
as
far
as
san
francisco
and
that
merchant
office
door
my
idea
is
that
samoa
would
be
found
an
eligible
business
centre
it
dead
before
the
wind
the
states
have
a
consul
there
and
steamers
call
so
we
could
skip
right
back
and
interview
the
merchant
said
herrick
will
take
us
for
ever
to
get
there
with
a
fair
wind
said
the
captain
trouble
about
the
log
eh
asked
huish
sir
said
davis
airs
and
baffling
winds
squalls
and
calms
five
miles
no
obs
pumps
attended
and
fill
in
the
barometer
and
thermometer
off
of
last
year
trip
saw
such
a
voyage
says
you
to
the
consul
i
was
going
to
run
short
he
stopped
in
mid
career
he
began
again
and
once
more
stopped
your
pardon
herrick
he
added
with
undisguised
humility
did
you
keep
the
run
of
the
stores
i
been
told
to
do
so
it
should
have
been
done
as
the
rest
was
done
to
the
best
of
my
little
ability
said
herrick
it
was
the
cook
helped
himself
to
what
he
pleased
davis
looked
at
the
table
drew
it
rather
fine
you
see
he
said
at
last
great
thing
was
to
clear
right
out
of
papeete
before
the
consul
could
think
better
of
it
tell
you
what
i
guess
i
take
stock
and
he
rose
from
table
and
disappeared
with
a
lamp
in
the
lazarette
another
screw
loose
observed
huish
man
said
herrick
with
a
sudden
gleam
of
animosity
is
still
your
watch
on
deck
and
surely
your
wheel
also
come
the
swell
do
you
ducky
said
huish
away
from
that
binnacle
surely
your
my
man
yah
he
lit
a
cigar
ostentatiously
and
strolled
into
the
waist
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
in
a
surprisingly
short
time
the
captain
reappeared
he
did
not
look
at
herrick
but
called
huish
back
and
sat
down
he
began
taken
stock
roughly
he
paused
as
if
for
somebody
to
help
him
out
and
none
doing
so
both
gazing
on
him
instead
with
manifest
anxiety
he
yet
more
heavily
resumed
it
fight
we
ca
do
it
that
the
bed
rock
i
as
sorry
as
what
you
can
be
and
sorrier
we
ca
look
near
samoa
i
do
know
as
we
could
get
to
peru
mean
asked
huish
brutally
ca
tell
myself
replied
the
captain
drew
it
fine
i
said
i
did
but
what
been
going
on
here
gets
me
appears
as
if
the
devil
had
been
around
that
cook
must
be
the
holiest
kind
of
fraud
only
twelve
days
too
seems
like
craziness
i
own
up
square
to
one
thing
i
seem
to
have
figured
too
fine
upon
the
flour
but
the
rest
my
land
i
never
understand
it
there
been
more
waste
on
this
twopenny
ship
than
what
there
is
to
an
atlantic
liner
he
stole
a
glance
at
his
companions
nothing
good
was
to
be
gleaned
from
their
dark
faces
and
he
had
recourse
to
rage
wait
till
i
interview
that
cook
he
roared
and
smote
the
table
with
his
fist
interview
the
son
of
a
gun
he
never
been
spoken
to
before
i
put
a
bead
upon
the
will
not
lay
a
finger
on
the
man
said
herrick
fault
is
yours
and
you
know
it
if
you
turn
a
savage
loose
in
your
you
know
what
to
expect
i
will
not
allow
the
man
to
be
molested
it
is
hard
to
say
how
davis
might
have
taken
this
defiance
but
he
was
diverted
to
a
fresh
assailant
drawled
huish
a
plummy
captain

you
a
blooming
captain

dyvis
do
me
i
dyngerous
davis
sat
like
one
bemused
it
might
even
have
been
doubted
if
he
heard
but
the
voice
of
the
clerk
rang
about
the
cabin
like
that
of
a
cormorant
among
the
ledges
of
the
cliff
will
do
huish
said
herrick
so

his
part

sneerin
snob

i
never

but

i
gave
as
good
let

bones
and

the

i

so
i
should
do
it
with
no
more
remorse
than
winking
take
care
take
care
you
little
cad
the
animosity
with
which
these
words
were
uttered
was
so
marked
in
itself
and
so
remarkable
in
the
man
who
uttered
them
that
huish
stared
and
even
the
humiliated
davis
reared
up
his
head
and
gazed
at
his
defender
as
for
herrick
the
successive
agitations
and
disappointments
of
the
day
had
left
him
wholly
reckless
he
was
conscious
of
a
pleasant
glow
an
agreeable
excitement
his
head
seemed
empty
his
eyeballs
burned
as
he
turned
them
his
throat
was
dry
as
a
biscuit
the
least
dangerous
man
by
nature
except
in
so
far
as
the
weak
are
always
dangerous
at
that
moment
he
was
ready
to
slay
or
to
be
slain
with
equal
unconcern
here
at
least
was
the
gage
thrown
down
and
battle
offered
he
who
should
speak
next
would
bring
the
matter
to
an
issue
there
and
then
all
knew
it
to
be
so
and
hung
back
and
for
many
seconds
by
the
cabin
clock
the
trio
sat
motionless
and
silent
then
came
an
interruption
welcome
as
the
flowers
in
may
ho
sang
out
a
voice
on
deck
a
weatha
bow
cried
davis
springing
to
his
feet
this
there
ai
no
land
here
and
as
men
may
run
from
the
chamber
of
a
murdered
corpse
the
three
ran
forth
out
of
the
house
and
left
their
quarrel
behind
them
undecided
the
sky
shaded
down
at
the
sea
level
to
the
white
of
opals
the
sea
itself
insolently
inkily
blue
drew
all
about
them
the
uncompromising
wheel
of
the
horizon
search
it
as
they
pleased
not
even
the
practisect
eye
of
captain
davis
could
descry
the
smallest
interruption
a
few
filmy
clouds
were
slowly
melting
overhead
and
about
the
schooner
as
around
the
only
point
of
interest
a
tropic
bird
white
as
a
snowflake
hung
and
circled
and
displayed
as
it
turned
the
long
vermilion
feather
of
its
tall
save
the
sea
and
the
heaven
that
was
all
sang
out
land
asked
davis
there
any
boy
playing
funny
dog
with
me
i
teach
him
skylarking
but
uncle
ned
contentedly
pointed
to
a
part
of
the
horizon
where
a
greenish
filmy
iridescence
could
be
discerned
floating
like
smoke
on
the
pale
heavens
davis
applied
his
glass
to
it
and
then
looked
at
the
kanaka
that
land
said
he
it
more
than
i
do
time
long
ago
said
uncle
ned
see
anaa
that
four
five
hours
befo
we
come
up
capena
he
say
sun
go
down
sun
go
up
again
he
say
lagoon
milla
what
asked
davis
sah
said
uncle
ned
ah
mirror
said
davis
see
reflection
from
the
lagoon
well
you
know
it
is
just
possible
though
it
strange
i
never
heard
of
it
here
let
look
at
the
chart
they
went
back
to
the
cabin
and
found
the
position
of
the
schooner
well
to
windward
of
the
archipelago
in
the
midst
of
a
white
field
of
paper
you
see
for
yourselves
said
davis
yet
i
do
know
said
herrick
somehow
think
there
something
in
it
i
tell
you
one
thing
too
captain
that
all
right
about
the
reflection
i
heard
it
in
papeete
up
that
findlay
then
said
davis
try
it
all
ways
an
island
would
come
amiss
the
way
we
fixed
the
bulky
volume
was
handed
up
to
him
as
is
the
way
with
findlay
and
he
turned
to
the
place
and
began
to
run
over
the
text
muttering
to
himself
and
turning
over
the
pages
with
a
wetted
finger
he
exclaimed
this
and
he
read
aloud
island
according
to
delille
this
island
which
from
private
interests
would
remain
unknown
lies
it
is
said
in
lat
degrees
long
degrees
in
addition
to
the
position
above
given
commander
matthews
scorpion
states
that
an
island
exists
in
lat
degrees
long
degrees
this
must
be
the
same
if
such
an
island
exists
which
is
very
doubtful
and
totally
disbelieved
in
by
south
sea
traders
said
huish
rather
in
the
conditional
mood
said
herrick
anything
you
please
cried
davis
there
it
is
that
our
place
and
do
you
make
any
mistake
from
private
interests
would
remain
unknown
read
herrick
over
his
shoulder
may
that
mean
should
mean
pearls
said
davis
pearling
island
the
government
do
know
about
that
sounds
like
real
estate
or
suppose
it
do
mean
anything
suppose
it
just
an
island
i
guess
we
could
fill
up
with
fish
and
cocoanuts
and
native
stuff
and
carry
out
the
samoa
scheme
hand
over
fist
how
long
did
he
say
it
was
before
they
raised
anaa
five
hours
i
think
or
five
said
herrick
davis
stepped
to
the
door
breeze
had
you
that
time
you
made
anaa
uncle
ned
said
he
or
seven
knots
was
the
reply
or
miles
said
davis
time
we
were
shortening
sail
then
if
it
is
an
island
we
do
want
to
be
butting
our
head
against
it
in
the
dark
and
if
it
is
an
island
we
can
get
through
it
just
as
well
by
daylight
ready
about
he
roared
and
the
schooner
head
was
laid
for
that
elusive
glimmer
in
the
sky
which
began
already
to
pale
in
lustre
and
diminish
in
size
as
the
stain
of
breath
vanishes
from
a
window
pane
at
the
same
time
she
was
reefed
close
down
part
ii
the
quartette
chapter
the
about
four
in
the
morning
as
the
captain
and
herrick
sat
together
on
the
rail
there
arose
from
the
midst
of
the
night
in
front
of
them
the
voice
of
breakers
each
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stared
and
listened
the
sound
was
continuous
like
the
passing
of
a
train
no
rise
or
fall
could
be
distinguished
minute
by
minute
the
ocean
heaved
with
an
equal
potency
against
the
invisible
isle
and
as
time
passed
and
herrick
waited
in
vain
for
any
vicissitude
in
the
volume
of
that
roaring
a
sense
of
the
eternal
weighed
upon
his
mind
to
the
expert
eye
the
isle
itself
was
to
be
inferred
from
a
certain
string
of
blots
along
the
starry
heaven
and
the
schooner
was
laid
to
and
anxiously
observed
till
daylight
there
was
little
or
no
morning
bank
a
brightening
came
in
the
east
then
a
wash
of
some
ineffable
faint
nameless
hue
between
crimson
and
silver
and
then
coals
of
fire
these
glimmered
a
while
on
the
sea
line
and
seemed
to
brighten
and
darken
and
spread
out
and
still
the
night
and
the
stars
reigned
undisturbed
it
was
as
though
a
spark
should
catch
and
glow
and
creep
along
the
foot
of
some
heavy
and
almost
incombustible
and
the
room
itself
be
scarce
menaced
yet
a
little
after
and
the
whole
east
glowed
with
gold
and
scarlet
and
the
hollow
of
heaven
was
filled
with
the
daylight
the
isle
the
undiscovered
the
scarce
now
lay
before
them
and
close
aboard
and
herrick
thought
that
never
in
his
dreams
had
he
beheld
anything
more
strange
and
delicate
the
beach
was
excellently
white
the
continuous
barrier
of
trees
inimitably
green
the
land
perhaps
ten
feet
high
the
trees
thirty
more
every
here
and
there
as
the
schooner
coasted
northward
the
wood
was
intermitted
and
he
could
see
clear
over
the
inconsiderable
strip
of
land
as
a
man
looks
over
a
wall
to
the
lagoon
within
and
clear
over
that
again
to
where
the
far
side
of
the
atoll
prolonged
its
pencilling
of
trees
against
the
morning
sky
he
tortured
himself
to
find
analogies
the
isle
was
like
the
rim
of
a
great
vessel
sunken
in
the
waters
it
was
like
the
embankment
of
an
annular
railway
grown
upon
with
wood
so
slender
it
seemed
amidst
the
outrageous
breakers
so
frail
and
pretty
he
would
scarce
have
wondered
to
see
it
sink
and
disappear
without
a
sound
and
the
waves
close
smoothly
over
its
descent
meanwhile
the
captain
was
in
the
glass
in
hand
his
eyes
in
every
quarter
spying
for
an
entrance
spying
for
signs
of
tenancy
but
the
isle
continued
to
unfold
itself
in
joints
and
to
run
out
in
indeterminate
capes
and
still
there
was
neither
house
nor
man
nor
the
smoke
of
fire
here
a
multitude
of
soared
and
twinkled
and
fished
in
the
blue
waters
and
there
and
for
miles
together
the
fringe
of
and
pandanus
extended
desolate
and
made
desirable
green
bowers
for
nobody
to
visit
and
the
silence
of
death
was
only
broken
by
the
throbbing
of
the
sea
the
airs
were
very
light
their
speed
was
small
the
heat
intense
the
decks
were
scorching
underfoot
the
sun
flamed
overhead
brazen
out
of
a
brazen
sky
the
pitch
bubbled
in
the
seams
and
the
brains
in
the
and
all
the
while
the
excitement
of
the
three
adventurers
glowed
about
their
bones
like
a
fever
they
whispered
and
nodded
and
pointed
and
put
mouth
to
ear
with
a
singular
instinct
of
secrecy
approaching
that
island
underhand
like
eavesdroppers
and
thieves
and
even
davis
from
the
gave
his
orders
mostly
by
gestures
the
hands
shared
in
this
mute
strain
like
dogs
without
comprehending
it
and
through
the
roar
of
so
many
miles
of
breakers
it
was
a
silent
ship
that
approached
an
empty
island
at
last
they
drew
near
to
the
break
in
that
interminable
gangway
a
spur
of
coral
sand
stood
forth
on
the
one
hand
on
the
other
a
high
and
thick
tuft
of
trees
cut
off
the
view
between
was
the
mouth
of
the
huge
laver
twice
a
day
the
ocean
crowded
in
that
narrow
entrance
and
was
heaped
between
these
frail
walls
twice
a
day
with
the
return
of
the
ebb
the
mighty
surplusage
of
water
must
struggle
to
escape
the
hour
in
which
the
farallone
came
there
was
the
hour
of
flood
the
sea
turned
as
with
the
instinct
of
the
homing
pigeon
for
the
vast
receptacle
swept
eddying
through
the
gates
was
transmuted
as
it
did
so
into
a
wonder
of
watery
and
silken
hues
and
brimmed
into
the
inland
sea
beyond
the
schooner
looked
up
and
was
caught
and
carried
away
by
the
influx
like
a
toy
she
skimmed
she
flew
a
momentary
shadow
touched
her
decks
from
the
trees
the
bottom
of
the
channel
showed
up
for
a
moment
and
was
in
a
moment
gone
the
next
she
floated
on
the
bosom
of
the
lagoon
and
below
in
the
transparent
chamber
of
waters
a
myriad
of
fishes
were
sporting
a
myriad
of
coral
diversified
the
floor
herrick
stood
transported
in
the
gratified
lust
of
his
eye
he
forgot
the
past
and
the
present
forgot
that
he
was
menaced
by
a
prison
on
the
one
hand
and
starvation
on
the
other
forgot
that
he
was
come
to
that
island
desperately
foraging
clutching
at
expedients
a
drove
of
fishes
painted
like
the
rainbow
and
billed
like
parrots
hovered
up
in
the
shadow
of
the
schooner
and
passed
clear
of
it
and
glinted
in
the
submarine
sun
they
were
beautiful
like
birds
and
their
silent
passage
impressed
him
like
a
strain
of
song
meanwhile
to
the
eye
of
davis
in
the
the
lagoon
continued
to
expand
its
empty
waters
and
the
long
succession
of
the
trees
to
be
paid
out
like
fishing
line
off
a
reel
and
still
there
was
no
mark
of
habitation
the
schooner
immediately
on
entering
had
been
kept
away
to
the
where
the
water
seemed
to
be
the
most
deep
and
she
was
now
skimming
past
the
tall
grove
of
trees
which
stood
on
that
side
of
the
channel
and
denied
further
view
of
the
whole
of
the
low
shores
of
the
island
only
this
bight
remained
to
be
revealed
and
suddenly
the
curtain
was
raised
they
began
to
open
out
a
haven
snugly
elbowed
there
and
beheld
with
an
astonishment
beyond
words
the
roofs
of
men
the
appearance
thus
disclosed
to
those
on
the
deck
of
the
farallone
was
not
that
of
a
city
rather
of
a
substantial
country
farm
with
its
attendant
hamlet
a
long
line
of
sheds
and
apart
upon
the
one
side
a
on
the
other
perhaps
a
dozen
native
huts
a
building
with
a
belfry
and
some
rude
offer
at
architectural
features
that
might
be
thought
to
mark
it
out
for
a
chapel
on
the
beach
in
front
some
heavy
boats
drawn
up
and
a
pile
of
timber
running
forth
into
the
burning
shallows
of
the
lagoon
from
a
flagstaff
at
the
pierhead
the
red
ensign
of
england
was
displayed
behind
about
and
over
the
same
tall
grove
of
palms
which
had
masked
the
settlement
in
the
beginning
prolonged
its
root
of
tumultuous
green
fans
and
turned
and
ruffled
overhead
and
sang
its
silver
song
all
day
in
the
wind
the
place
had
the
indescribable
but
unmistakable
appearance
of
being
in
commission
yet
there
breathed
from
it
a
sense
of
desertion
that
was
almost
poignant
no
human
figure
was
to
be
observed
going
to
and
fro
about
the
houses
and
there
was
no
sound
of
human
industry
or
enjoyment
only
on
the
top
of
the
beach
and
hard
by
the
flagstaff
a
woman
of
exorbitant
stature
and
as
white
as
snow
was
to
be
seen
beckoning
with
uplifted
arm
the
second
glance
identified
her
as
a
piece
of
naval
sculpture
the
of
a
ship
that
had
long
hovered
and
plunged
into
so
many
running
billows
and
was
now
brought
ashore
to
be
the
ensign
and
presiding
genius
of
that
empty
town
the
farallone
made
a
soldier
breeze
of
it
the
wind
besides
was
stronger
inside
than
without
under
the
lee
of
the
land
and
the
stolen
schooner
opened
out
successive
objects
with
the
swiftness
of
a
panorama
so
that
the
adventurers
stood
speechless
the
flag
spoke
for
itself
it
was
no
frayed
and
weathered
trophy
that
had
beaten
itself
to
pieces
on
the
post
flying
over
desolation
and
to
make
assurance
stronger
there
was
to
be
descried
in
the
deep
shade
of
the
verandah
a
glitter
of
crystal
and
the
fluttering
of
white
napery
if
the
at
the
pier
end
with
its
perpetual
gesture
and
its
leprous
whiteness
reigned
alone
in
that
hamlet
as
it
seemed
to
do
it
would
not
have
reigned
long
men
hands
had
been
busy
men
feet
stirring
there
within
the
circuit
of
the
clock
the
farallones
were
sure
of
it
their
eyes
dug
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
palms
for
some
one
hiding
if
intensity
of
looking
might
have
prevailed
they
would
have
pierced
the
walls
of
houses
and
there
came
to
them
in
these
pregnant
seconds
a
sense
of
being
watched
and
played
with
and
of
a
blow
impending
that
was
hardly
bearable
the
extreme
point
of
palms
they
had
just
passed
enclosed
a
creek
which
was
thus
hidden
up
to
the
last
moment
from
the
eyes
of
those
on
board
and
from
this
a
boat
put
suddenly
and
briskly
out
and
a
voice
hailed
ahoy
it
cried
in
for
the
pier
in
two
lengths
you
have
twenty
fathoms
water
and
good
holding
ground
the
boat
was
manned
with
a
couple
of
brown
oarsmen
in
scanty
kilts
of
blue
the
speaker
who
was
steering
wore
white
clothes
the
full
dress
of
the
tropics
a
wide
hat
shaded
his
face
but
it
could
be
seen
that
he
was
of
stalwart
size
and
his
voice
sounded
like
a
gentleman
so
much
could
be
made
out
it
was
plain
besides
that
the
farallone
had
been
descried
some
time
before
at
sea
and
the
inhabitants
were
prepared
for
its
reception
mechanically
the
orders
were
obeyed
and
the
ship
berthed
and
the
three
adventurers
gathered
aft
beside
the
house
and
waited
with
galloping
pulses
and
a
perfect
vacancy
of
mind
the
coming
of
the
stranger
who
might
mean
so
much
to
them
they
had
no
plan
no
story
prepared
there
was
no
time
to
make
one
they
were
caught
and
must
stand
their
chance
yet
this
anxiety
was
chequered
with
hope
the
island
being
undeclared
it
was
not
possible
the
man
could
hold
any
office
or
be
in
a
position
to
demand
their
papers
and
beyond
that
if
there
was
any
truth
in
findlay
as
it
now
seemed
there
should
be
he
was
the
representative
of
the
reasons
he
must
see
their
coming
with
a
profound
disappointment
and
perhaps
hope
whispered
he
would
be
willing
and
able
to
purchase
their
silence
the
boat
was
by
that
time
forging
alongside
and
they
were
able
at
last
to
see
what
manner
of
man
they
had
to
do
with
he
was
a
huge
fellow
six
feet
four
in
height
and
of
a
build
proportionately
strong
but
his
sinews
seemed
to
be
dissolved
in
a
listlessness
that
was
more
than
languor
it
was
only
the
eye
that
corrected
this
impression
an
eye
of
an
unusual
mingled
brilliancy
and
softness
sombre
as
coal
and
with
lights
that
outshone
the
topaz
an
eye
of
unimpaired
health
and
virility
an
eye
that
bid
you
beware
of
the
man
devastating
anger
a
complexion
naturally
dark
had
been
tanned
in
the
island
to
a
hue
hardly
distinguishable
from
that
of
a
tahitian
only
his
manners
and
movements
and
the
living
force
that
dwelt
in
him
like
fire
in
flint
betrayed
the
european
he
was
dressed
in
white
drill
exquisitely
made
his
scarf
and
tie
were
of
silks
on
the
thwart
beside
him
there
leaned
a
winchester
rifle
the
doctor
on
board
he
cried
as
he
came
up
symonds
i
mean
you
never
heard
of
him
nor
yet
of
the
trinity
hall
ah
he
did
not
look
surprised
seemed
rather
to
affect
it
in
politeness
but
his
eye
rested
on
each
of
the
three
white
men
in
succession
with
a
sudden
weight
of
curiosity
that
was
almost
savage
then
said
he
is
some
small
mistake
no
doubt
and
i
must
ask
you
to
what
i
am
indebted
for
this
pleasure
he
was
by
this
time
on
the
deck
but
he
had
the
art
to
be
quite
unapproachable
the
friendliest
vulgarian
three
parts
drunk
would
have
known
better
than
take
liberties
and
not
one
of
the
adventurers
so
much
as
offered
to
shake
hands
said
davis
suppose
you
may
call
it
an
accident
we
had
heard
of
your
island
and
read
that
thing
in
the
directory
about
the
private
reasons
you
see
so
when
we
saw
the
lagoon
reflected
in
the
sky
we
put
her
head
for
it
at
once
and
so
here
we
are
we
do
intrude
said
huish
the
stranger
looked
at
huish
with
an
air
of
faint
surprise
and
looked
pointedly
away
again
it
was
hard
to
be
more
offensive
in
dumb
show
may
suit
me
your
coming
here
he
said
own
schooner
is
overdue
and
i
may
put
something
in
your
way
in
the
meantime
are
you
open
to
a
charter
i
guess
so
said
davis
depends
name
is
attwater
continued
the
stranger
i
presume
are
the
captain
sir
i
am
the
captain
of
this
ship
captain
brown
was
the
reply
see
said
huish
begin
fair
skipper
on
deck
right
enough
but
not
below
below
we
all
equal
all
got
a
lay
in
the
adventure
when
it
comes
to
business
i
as
good
as
and
what
i
say
is
let
go
into
the
and
have
a
lush
and
talk
it
over
among
pals
we
some
prime
fizz
he
said
and
winked
the
presence
of
the
gentleman
lighted
up
like
a
candle
the
vulgarity
of
the
clerk
and
herrick
instinctively
as
one
shields
himself
from
pain
made
haste
to
interrupt
name
is
hay
said
he
introductions
are
going
we
shall
be
very
glad
if
you
will
step
inside
attwater
leaned
to
him
swiftly
man
said
he
merton
said
herrick
and
the
next
moment
blushed
scarlet
at
his
indiscretion
am
of
the
other
lot
said
attwater
hall
cambridge
i
called
my
schooner
after
the
old
shop
well
this
is
a
queer
place
and
company
for
us
to
meet
in
mr
hay
he
pursued
with
easy
incivility
to
the
others
do
you
bear
out
i
beg
this
gentleman
pardon
i
really
did
not
catch
his
name
name
is
sir
returned
the
clerk
and
blushed
in
turn
said
attwater
and
then
turning
again
to
herrick
you
bear
out
mr
whish
description
of
your
vintage
or
was
it
only
the
unaffected
poetry
of
his
own
nature
bubbling
up
herrick
was
embarrassed
the
silken
brutality
of
their
visitor
made
him
blush
that
he
should
be
accepted
as
an
equal
and
the
others
thus
pointedly
ignored
pleased
him
in
spite
of
himself
and
then
ran
through
his
veins
in
a
recoil
of
anger
do
know
he
said
only
california
it
good
enough
i
believe
attwater
seemed
to
make
up
his
mind
then
i
tell
you
what
you
three
gentlemen
come
ashore
this
evening
and
bring
a
basket
of
wine
with
you
i
try
and
find
the
food
he
said
by
the
by
here
is
a
question
i
should
have
asked
you
when
i
come
on
board
have
you
had
smallpox
no
said
herrick
the
schooner
had
it
from
attwater
said
herrick
it
is
a
dreadful
sickness
said
attwater
you
any
deaths
asked
huish
on
the
island
said
attwater
deaths
and
cases
out
of
souls
upon
the
that
a
strange
way
to
calculate
mr
hay
is
it
not
souls
i
never
say
it
but
it
startles
me
so
that
why
everything
deserted
said
huish
is
why
mr
whish
said
attwater
is
why
the
house
is
empty
and
the
graveyard
full
out
of
exclaimed
herrick
when
it
came
to
burying
or
did
you
bother
burying
said
attwater
there
was
one
day
at
least
when
we
gave
up
there
were
five
of
the
dead
that
morning
and
thirteen
of
the
dying
and
no
one
able
to
go
about
except
the
sexton
and
myself
we
held
a
council
of
war
took
the
empty
bottles
into
the
lagoon
and
buried
them
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
back
at
the
bright
water
so
you
come
to
dinner
then
shall
we
say
six
so
good
of
you
his
voice
in
uttering
these
conventional
phrases
fell
at
once
into
the
false
measure
of
society
and
herrick
unconsciously
followed
the
example
am
sure
we
shall
be
very
glad
he
said
six
thank
you
so
very
much
for
my
voice
has
been
tuned
to
the
note
of
the
gun
that
startles
the
deep
when
the
combat
begun
quoted
attwater
with
a
smile
which
instantly
gave
way
to
an
air
of
funereal
solemnity
shall
particularly
expect
mr
whish
he
continued
whish
i
trust
you
understand
the
invitation
believe
you
my
boy
replied
the
genial
huish
is
right
then
and
quite
understood
is
it
not
said
attwater
whish
and
captain
brown
at
without
fault
and
you
hay
at
four
sharp
and
he
called
his
boat
during
all
this
talk
a
load
of
thought
or
anxiety
had
weighed
upon
the
captain
there
was
no
part
for
which
nature
had
so
liberally
endowed
him
as
that
of
the
genial
ship
captain
but
today
he
was
silent
and
abstracted
those
who
knew
him
could
see
that
he
hearkened
close
to
every
syllable
and
seemed
to
ponder
and
try
it
in
balances
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
what
look
there
was
cold
attentive
and
sinister
as
of
a
man
maturing
plans
which
still
brooded
over
the
unconscious
guest
it
was
here
it
was
there
it
was
nowhere
it
was
now
so
little
that
herrick
chid
himself
for
an
idle
fancy
and
anon
it
was
so
gross
and
palpable
that
you
could
say
every
hair
on
the
man
head
talked
mischief
he
woke
up
now
as
with
a
start
were
talking
of
a
charter
said
he
i
said
attwater
let
talk
of
it
no
more
at
present
own
schooner
is
overdue
i
understand
continued
the
captain
understand
perfectly
captain
brown
said
attwater
days
overdue
at
noon
today
comes
and
goes
eh
plies
between
here
and
hinted
the
captain
every
four
months
three
trips
in
the
year
said
attwater
go
in
her
ever
asked
davis
one
stops
here
said
attwater
has
plenty
to
attend
to
here
do
you
cried
davis
how
long
long
o
lord
said
attwater
with
perfect
stern
gravity
it
does
not
seem
so
he
added
with
a
smile
i
dare
say
not
said
davis
i
suppose
not
not
with
all
your
gods
about
you
and
in
as
snug
a
berth
as
this
for
it
is
a
pretty
snug
berth
said
he
with
a
sweeping
look
spot
as
you
are
good
enough
to
indicate
is
not
entirely
intolerable
was
the
reply
i
suppose
said
davis
there
was
shell
said
attwater
is
a
considerable
big
beast
of
a
lagoon
sir
said
the
captain
there
a
was
the
fishing
would
you
call
the
fishing
anyways
good
do
know
that
i
would
call
it
anyways
anything
said
attwater
you
put
it
to
me
direct
were
pearls
too
said
davis
too
said
attwater
i
give
out
laughed
davis
and
his
laughter
rang
cracked
like
a
false
piece
you
not
going
to
tell
you
not
going
to
tell
and
there
an
end
to
it
can
be
no
reason
why
i
should
affect
the
least
degree
of
secrecy
about
my
island
returned
attwater
came
wholly
to
an
end
with
your
arrival
and
i
am
sure
at
any
rate
that
gentlemen
like
you
and
mr
whish
i
should
have
always
been
charmed
to
make
perfectly
at
home
the
point
on
which
we
are
now
differing
if
you
can
call
it
a
difference
is
one
of
times
and
seasons
i
have
some
information
which
you
think
i
might
impart
and
i
think
not
well
we
see
tonight
whish
he
stepped
into
his
boat
and
shoved
off
understood
then
said
he
captain
and
mr
whish
at
and
you
hay
at
four
precise
you
understand
that
hay
mind
i
take
no
denial
if
you
not
there
by
the
time
named
there
will
be
no
banquet
no
song
no
supper
mr
whish
white
birds
whisked
in
the
air
above
a
shoal
of
fishes
in
the
scarce
denser
medium
below
between
like
mahomet
coffin
the
boat
drew
away
briskly
on
the
surface
and
its
shadow
followed
it
over
the
glittering
floor
of
the
lagoon
attwater
looked
steadily
back
over
his
shoulders
as
he
sat
he
did
not
once
remove
his
eyes
from
the
farallone
and
the
group
on
her
beside
the
house
till
his
boat
ground
upon
the
pier
thence
with
an
agile
pace
he
hurried
ashore
and
they
saw
his
white
clothes
shining
in
the
chequered
dusk
of
the
grove
until
the
house
received
him
the
captain
with
a
gesture
and
a
speaking
countenance
called
the
adventurers
into
the
cabin
he
said
to
herrick
when
they
were
seated
one
good
job
at
least
he
taken
to
you
in
earnest
should
that
be
a
good
job
said
herrick
you
see
how
it
pans
out
presently
returned
davis
go
ashore
and
stand
in
with
him
that
all
you
get
lots
of
pointers
you
can
find
out
what
he
has
and
what
the
charter
is
and
who
the
fourth
man
for
there
four
of
them
and
we
only
three
suppose
i
do
what
next
cried
herrick
me
that
i
will
robert
herrick
said
the
captain
first
let
see
all
clear
i
guess
you
know
he
said
with
an
imperious
solemnity
guess
you
know
the
bottom
is
out
of
this
farallone
speculation
i
guess
you
know
it
right
out
and
if
this
old
island
had
been
turned
up
right
when
it
did
i
guess
you
know
where
you
and
i
and
huish
would
have
been
i
know
that
said
herrick
matter
who
to
blame
i
know
it
and
what
next
matter
who
to
blame
you
know
it
right
enough
said
the
captain
i
obliged
to
you
for
the
reminder
now
here
this
attwater
what
do
you
think
of
him
do
not
know
said
herrick
am
attracted
and
repelled
he
was
insufferably
rude
to
you
you
huish
said
the
captain
huish
sat
cleaning
a
favourite
briar
root
he
scarce
looked
up
from
that
engrossing
task
ast
me
what
i
think
of
him
he
said
a
day
comin
i
pray
gawd
when
i
can
tell
it
him
myself
means
the
same
as
what
i
do
said
davis
that
man
came
stepping
around
and
saying
look
here
i
attwater
and
you
knew
it
was
so
by
god
i
sized
him
right
straight
up
here
the
real
article
i
said
and
i
do
like
it
here
the
real
aristocrat
i
do
know
ye
do
i
god
damn
ye
did
god
make
ye
no
that
could
be
nothing
but
genuine
a
man
got
to
be
born
to
that
and
notice
smart
as
champagne
and
hard
as
nails
no
kind
of
a
fool
no
sir
not
a
pound
of
him
well
what
he
here
upon
this
beastly
island
for
i
said
he
not
here
collecting
eggs
he
a
palace
at
home
and
powdered
flunkies
and
if
he
do
stay
there
you
bet
he
knows
the
reason
why
follow
yes
i
you
said
huish
been
doing
good
business
here
then
continued
the
captain
ten
years
he
been
doing
a
great
business
it
pearl
and
shell
of
course
there
could
be
nothing
else
in
such
a
place
and
no
doubt
the
shell
goes
off
regularly
by
this
trinity
hall
and
the
money
for
it
straight
into
the
bank
so
that
no
use
to
us
but
what
else
is
there
is
there
nothing
else
he
would
be
likely
to
keep
here
is
there
nothing
else
he
would
be
bound
to
keep
here
yes
sir
the
pearls
first
because
they
too
valuable
to
trust
out
of
his
hands
second
because
pearls
want
a
lot
of
handling
and
matching
and
the
man
who
sells
his
pearls
as
they
come
in
one
here
one
there
instead
of
hanging
back
and
holding
up
well
that
man
a
fool
and
it
not
attwater
said
huish
it
is
not
proved
but
likely
proved
said
davis
bluntly
it
was
said
herrick
that
was
all
so
and
he
had
these
pearls
a
ten
years
collection
of
them
suppose
he
had
my
question
the
captain
drummed
with
his
thick
hands
on
the
board
in
front
of
him
he
looked
steadily
in
herrick
face
and
herrick
as
steadily
looked
upon
the
table
and
the
pattering
fingers
there
was
a
gentle
oscillation
of
the
anchored
ship
and
a
big
patch
of
sunlight
travelled
to
and
fro
between
the
one
and
the
other
me
herrick
burst
out
suddenly
you
better
hear
me
first
said
davis
me
and
understand
me
we
got
no
use
for
that
fellow
whatever
you
may
have
he
your
kind
he
not
ours
he
took
to
you
and
he
wiped
his
boots
on
me
and
huish
save
him
if
you
can
him
repeated
herrick
him
if
you
able
reiterated
davis
with
a
blow
of
his
clenched
fist
ashore
and
talk
him
smooth
and
if
you
get
him
and
his
pearls
aboard
i
spare
him
if
you
do
there
going
to
be
a
funeral
is
that
so
huish
does
that
suit
you
ai
a
forgiving
man
said
huish
i
not
the
sort
to
spoil
business
neither
bring
the
bloke
on
board
and
bring
his
pearls
along
with
him
and
you
can
have
it
your
own
way
maroon
him
where
you
like
i
agreeable
and
if
i
ca
cried
herrick
while
the
sweat
streamed
upon
his
face
talk
to
me
as
if
i
was
god
almighty
to
do
this
and
that
but
if
i
ca
son
said
the
captain
better
do
your
level
best
or
see
sights
yes
said
huish
crikey
yes
he
looked
across
at
herrick
with
a
toothless
smile
that
was
shocking
in
its
savagery
and
his
ear
caught
apparently
by
the
trivial
expression
he
had
used
broke
into
a
piece
of
the
chorus
of
a
comic
song
which
he
must
have
heard
twenty
years
before
in
london
meaningless
gibberish
that
in
that
hour
and
place
seemed
hateful
as
a
blasphemy
pikey
crikey
fikey
chillingawallaba
dory
the
captain
suffered
him
to
finish
his
face
was
unchanged
way
things
are
there
many
a
man
that
would
let
you
go
ashore
he
resumed
i
not
that
kind
i
know
you
never
go
back
on
me
herrick
or
if
you
choose
to
go
and
do
it
and
be
damned
he
cried
and
rose
abruptly
from
the
table
he
walked
out
of
the
house
and
as
he
reached
the
door
turned
and
called
huish
suddenly
and
violently
like
the
barking
of
a
dog
huish
followed
and
herrick
remained
alone
in
the
cabin
see
here
whispered
davis
know
that
man
if
you
open
your
mouth
to
him
again
you
ruin
all
chapter
better
acquaintance
the
boat
was
gone
again
and
already
to
the
farallone
before
herrick
turned
and
went
unwillingly
up
the
pier
from
the
crown
of
the
beach
the
confronted
him
with
what
seemed
irony
her
helmeted
head
tossed
back
her
formidable
arm
apparently
hurling
something
whether
shell
or
missile
in
the
direction
of
the
anchored
schooner
she
seemed
a
defiant
deity
from
the
island
coming
forth
to
its
threshold
with
a
rush
as
of
one
about
to
fly
and
perpetuated
in
that
dashing
attitude
herrick
looked
up
at
her
where
she
towered
above
him
head
and
shoulders
with
singular
feelings
of
curiosity
and
romance
and
suffered
his
mind
to
travel
to
and
fro
in
her
so
long
she
had
been
the
blind
conductress
of
a
ship
among
the
waves
so
long
she
had
stood
here
idle
in
the
violent
sun
that
yet
did
not
avail
to
blister
her
and
was
even
this
the
end
of
so
many
adventures
he
wondered
or
was
more
behind
and
he
could
have
found
in
his
heart
to
regret
that
she
was
not
a
goddess
nor
yet
he
a
pagan
that
he
might
have
bowed
down
before
her
in
that
hour
of
difficulty
when
he
now
went
forward
it
was
cool
with
the
shadow
of
many
palms
draughts
of
the
dying
breeze
swung
them
together
overhead
and
on
all
sides
with
a
swiftness
beyond
or
swallows
the
spots
of
sunshine
flitted
and
hovered
and
returned
underfoot
the
sand
was
fairly
solid
and
quite
level
and
herrick
steps
fell
there
noiseless
as
in
snow
it
bore
the
marks
of
having
been
once
weeded
like
a
garden
alley
at
home
but
the
pestilence
had
done
its
work
and
the
weeds
were
returning
the
buildings
of
the
settlement
showed
here
and
there
through
the
stems
of
the
colonnade
fresh
painted
trim
and
dandy
and
all
silent
as
the
grave
only
here
and
there
in
the
crypt
there
was
a
rustle
and
scurry
and
some
crowing
of
poultry
and
from
behind
the
house
with
the
verandahs
he
saw
smoke
arise
and
heard
the
crackling
of
a
fire
the
stone
houses
were
nearest
him
upon
his
right
the
first
was
locked
in
the
second
he
could
dimly
perceive
through
a
window
a
certain
accumulation
of
piled
in
the
far
end
the
third
which
stood
gaping
open
on
the
afternoon
seized
on
the
mind
of
herrick
with
its
multiplicity
and
disorder
of
romantic
things
therein
were
cables
windlasses
and
blocks
of
every
size
and
capacity
cabin
windows
and
ladders
rusty
tanks
a
companion
hutch
a
binnacle
with
its
brass
mountings
and
its
compass
idly
pointing
in
the
confusion
and
dusk
of
that
shed
to
a
forgotten
pole
ropes
anchors
harpoons
a
blubber
dipper
of
copper
green
with
years
a
steering
wheel
a
tool
chest
with
the
vessel
name
upon
the
top
the
asia
a
whole
of
sea
curios
gross
and
solid
heavy
to
lift
ill
to
break
bound
with
brass
and
shod
with
iron
two
wrecks
at
the
least
must
have
contributed
to
this
random
heap
of
lumber
and
as
herrick
looked
upon
it
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
two
ships
companies
were
there
on
guard
and
he
heard
the
tread
of
feet
and
whisperings
and
saw
with
the
tail
of
his
eye
the
commonplace
ghosts
of
sailor
men
this
was
not
merely
the
work
of
an
aroused
imagination
but
had
something
sensible
to
go
upon
sounds
of
a
stealthy
approach
were
no
doubt
audible
and
while
he
still
stood
staring
at
the
lumber
the
voice
of
his
host
sounded
suddenly
and
with
even
more
than
the
customary
softness
of
enunciation
from
behind
it
said
old
junk
and
does
mr
hay
find
a
parable
find
at
least
a
strong
impression
replied
herrick
turning
quickly
lest
he
might
be
able
to
catch
on
the
face
of
the
speaker
some
commentary
on
the
words
attwater
stood
in
the
doorway
which
he
almost
wholly
filled
his
hands
stretched
above
his
head
and
grasping
the
architrave
he
smiled
when
their
eyes
met
but
the
expression
was
inscrutable
a
powerful
impression
you
are
like
me
nothing
so
affecting
as
ships
said
he
ruins
of
an
empire
would
leave
me
frigid
when
a
bit
of
an
old
rail
that
an
old
shellback
leaned
on
in
the
middle
watch
would
bring
me
up
all
standing
but
come
let
see
some
more
of
the
island
it
all
sand
and
coral
and
palm
trees
but
there
a
kind
of
a
quaintness
in
the
place
find
it
heavenly
said
herrick
breathing
deep
with
head
bared
in
the
shadow
that
because
you
new
from
sea
said
attwater
dare
say
too
you
can
appreciate
what
one
calls
it
it
a
lovely
name
it
has
a
flavour
it
has
a
colour
it
has
a
ring
and
fall
to
it
it
like
its
author
it
half
christian
remember
your
first
view
of
the
island
and
how
it
only
woods
and
water
and
suppose
you
had
asked
somebody
for
the
name
and
he
had
answered
nemorosa
zacynthos
medio
apparet
fluctu
exclaimed
herrick
gods
yes
how
good
it
gets
upon
the
chart
the
skippers
will
make
nice
work
of
it
said
attwater
here
come
and
see
the
he
opened
a
door
and
herrick
saw
a
large
display
of
apparatus
neatly
ordered
pumps
and
pipes
and
the
leaded
boots
and
the
huge
snouted
helmets
shining
in
rows
along
the
wall
ten
complete
outfits
whole
eastern
half
of
my
lagoon
is
shallow
you
must
understand
said
attwater
we
were
able
to
get
in
the
dress
to
great
advantage
it
paid
beyond
belief
and
was
a
queer
sight
when
they
were
at
it
and
these
marine
monsters
tapping
the
nearest
of
the
helmets
appearing
and
reappearing
in
the
midst
of
the
lagoon
fond
of
parables
he
asked
abruptly
yes
said
herrick
i
saw
these
machines
come
up
dripping
and
go
down
again
and
come
up
dripping
and
go
down
again
and
all
the
while
the
fellow
inside
as
dry
as
toast
said
attwater
i
thought
we
all
wanted
a
dress
to
go
down
into
the
world
in
and
come
up
scatheless
what
do
you
think
the
name
was
he
inquired
said
herrick
but
i
mean
seriously
said
attwater
it
then
corrected
herrick
with
a
laugh
why
not
grace
why
not
god
grace
hay
asked
attwater
not
the
grace
of
your
maker
and
redeemer
he
who
died
for
you
he
who
upholds
you
he
whom
you
daily
crucify
afresh
there
is
nothing
here
striking
on
his
bosom
there
smiting
the
wall
nothing
there
stamping
but
god
grace
we
walk
upon
it
we
breathe
it
we
live
and
die
by
it
it
makes
the
nails
and
axles
of
the
universe
and
a
puppy
in
pyjamas
prefers
the
huge
dark
man
stood
over
against
herrick
by
the
line
of
the
divers
helmets
and
seemed
to
swell
and
glow
and
the
next
moment
the
life
had
gone
from
him
beg
your
pardon
said
he
see
you
do
believe
in
god
in
your
sense
i
am
afraid
said
herrick
never
argue
with
young
atheists
or
habitual
drunkards
said
attwater
flippantly
us
go
across
the
island
to
the
outer
beach
it
was
but
a
little
way
the
greatest
width
of
that
island
scarce
exceeding
a
furlong
and
they
walked
gently
herrick
was
like
one
in
a
dream
he
had
come
there
with
a
mind
divided
come
prepared
to
study
that
ambiguous
and
sneering
mask
drag
out
the
essential
man
from
underneath
and
act
accordingly
decision
being
till
then
postponed
iron
cruelty
an
iron
insensibility
to
the
suffering
of
others
the
uncompromising
pursuit
of
his
own
interests
cold
culture
manners
without
humanity
these
he
had
looked
for
these
he
still
thought
he
saw
but
to
find
the
whole
machine
thus
glow
with
the
reverberation
of
religious
zeal
surprised
him
beyond
words
and
he
laboured
in
vain
as
he
walked
to
piece
together
into
any
kind
of
whole
his
odds
and
ends
of
knowledge
to
adjust
again
into
any
kind
of
focus
with
itself
his
picture
of
the
man
beside
him
brought
you
here
to
the
south
seas
he
asked
presently
things
said
attwater
curiosity
romance
the
love
of
the
sea
and
it
will
surprise
you
to
hear
an
interest
in
missions
that
has
a
good
deal
declined
which
will
surprise
you
less
they
go
the
wrong
way
to
work
they
are
too
parsonish
too
much
of
the
old
wife
and
even
the
old
apple
wife
clothes
clothes
are
their
idea
but
clothes
are
not
christianity
any
more
than
they
are
the
sun
in
heaven
or
could
take
the
place
of
it
they
think
a
parsonage
with
roses
and
church
bells
and
nice
old
women
bobbing
in
the
lanes
are
part
and
parcel
of
religion
but
religion
is
a
savage
thing
like
the
universe
it
illuminates
savage
cold
and
bare
but
infinitely
strong
you
found
this
island
by
an
accident
said
herrick
you
did
said
attwater
since
then
i
have
had
a
business
and
a
colony
and
a
mission
of
my
own
i
was
a
man
of
the
world
before
i
was
a
christian
i
a
man
of
the
world
still
and
i
made
my
mission
pay
no
good
ever
came
of
coddling
a
man
has
to
stand
up
in
god
sight
and
work
up
to
his
weight
avoirdupois
then
i
talk
to
him
but
not
before
i
gave
these
beggars
what
they
wanted
a
judge
in
israel
the
bearer
of
the
sword
and
scourge
i
was
making
a
new
people
here
and
behold
the
angel
of
the
lord
smote
them
and
they
were
not
with
the
very
uttering
of
the
words
which
were
accompanied
by
a
gesture
they
came
forth
out
of
the
porch
of
the
palm
wood
by
the
margin
of
the
sea
and
full
in
front
of
the
sun
which
was
near
setting
before
them
the
surf
broke
slowly
all
around
with
an
air
of
imperfect
wooden
things
inspired
with
wicked
activity
the
crabs
trundled
and
scuttled
into
holes
on
the
right
whither
attwater
pointed
and
abruptly
turned
was
the
cemetery
of
the
island
a
field
of
broken
stones
from
the
bigness
of
a
child
hand
to
that
of
his
head
diversified
by
many
mounds
of
the
same
material
and
walled
by
a
rude
rectangular
enclosure
nothing
grew
there
but
a
shrub
or
two
with
some
white
flowers
nothing
but
the
number
of
the
mounds
and
their
disquieting
shape
indicated
the
presence
of
the
dead
rude
forefathers
of
the
hamlet
sleep
quoted
attwater
as
he
entered
by
the
open
gateway
into
that
unholy
close
to
coral
pebbles
to
pebbles
he
said
has
been
the
main
scene
of
my
activity
in
the
south
pacific
some
were
good
and
some
bad
and
the
majority
of
course
and
always
null
here
was
a
fellow
now
that
used
to
frisk
like
a
dog
if
you
had
called
him
he
came
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
if
you
had
not
and
he
came
unbidden
you
should
have
seen
the
deprecating
eye
and
the
little
intricate
dancing
step
well
his
trouble
is
over
now
he
has
lain
down
with
kings
and
councillors
the
rest
of
his
acts
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
that
fellow
was
from
penrhyn
like
all
the
penrhyn
islanders
he
was
ill
to
manage
heady
jealous
violent
the
man
with
the
nose
he
lies
here
quiet
enough
and
so
they
all
lie
and
darkness
was
the
burier
of
the
dead
he
stood
in
the
strong
glow
of
the
sunset
with
bowed
head
his
voice
sounded
now
sweet
and
now
bitter
with
the
varying
sense
loved
these
people
cried
herrick
strangely
touched
said
attwater
no
do
think
me
a
philanthropist
i
dislike
men
and
hate
women
if
i
like
the
islands
at
all
it
is
because
you
see
them
here
plucked
of
their
lendings
their
dead
birds
and
cocked
hats
their
petticoats
and
coloured
hose
here
was
one
i
liked
though
and
he
set
his
foot
upon
a
mound
was
a
fine
savage
fellow
he
had
a
dark
soul
yes
i
liked
this
one
i
am
fanciful
he
added
looking
hard
at
herrick
i
take
fads
i
like
you
herrick
turned
swiftly
and
looked
far
away
to
where
the
clouds
were
beginning
to
troop
together
and
amass
themselves
round
the
obsequies
of
day
one
can
like
me
he
said
are
wrong
there
said
the
other
a
man
usually
is
about
himself
you
are
attractive
very
attractive
is
not
me
said
herrick
one
can
like
me
if
you
knew
how
i
despised
myself
and
why
his
voice
rang
out
in
the
quiet
graveyard
knew
that
you
despised
yourself
said
attwater
saw
the
blood
come
into
your
face
today
when
you
remembered
oxford
and
i
could
have
blushed
for
you
myself
to
see
a
man
a
gentleman
with
these
two
vulgar
wolves
herrick
faced
him
with
a
thrill
he
repeated
said
wolves
and
vulgar
wolves
said
attwater
you
know
that
today
when
i
came
on
board
i
trembled
concealed
it
well
stammered
herrick
habit
of
mine
said
attwater
i
was
afraid
for
all
that
i
was
afraid
of
the
two
wolves
he
raised
his
hand
slowly
now
hay
you
poor
lost
puppy
what
do
you
do
with
the
two
wolves
do
i
do
i
do
do
anything
said
herrick
is
nothing
wrong
all
is
above
board
captain
brown
is
a
good
soul
he
is
a
he
is
the
phantom
voice
of
davis
called
in
his
ear
going
to
be
a
funeral
and
the
sweat
burst
forth
and
streamed
on
his
brow
is
a
family
man
he
resumed
again
swallowing
has
children
at
home
and
a
wife
a
very
nice
man

attwater
so
is
mr
whish
no
doubt
wo
go
so
far
as
that
said
herrick
do
not
like
huish
and
yet
he
has
his
merits
too
in
short
take
them
for
all
in
all
as
good
a
ship
company
as
one
would
ask
said
attwater
yes
said
herrick
then
we
approach
the
other
point
of
why
you
despise
yourself
said
attwater
we
not
all
despise
ourselves
cried
herrick
not
you
i
say
i
do
but
do
i
said
attwater
thing
i
know
at
least
i
never
gave
a
cry
like
yours
hay
it
came
from
a
bad
conscience
ah
man
that
poor
diving
dress
of
is
sadly
tattered
today
now
while
the
sun
sets
and
here
in
this
burying
place
of
brown
innocents
fall
on
your
knees
and
cast
your
sins
and
sorrows
on
the
redeemer
hay

the
other
strangling

god
sake

are
on
the
screws
said
attwater
god
i
will
bring
a
penitent
this
night
before
his
throne
come
come
to
the
he
waits
to
be
gracious
man
waits
to
be
gracious
he
spread
out
his
arms
like
a
crucifix
his
face
shone
with
the
brightness
of
a
seraph
in
his
voice
as
it
rose
to
the
last
word
the
tears
seemed
ready
herrick
made
a
vigorous
call
upon
himself
he
said
push
me
beyond
bearing
what
am
i
to
do
i
do
not
believe
it
is
living
truth
to
you
to
me
upon
my
conscience
only
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
form
of
words
under
heaven
by
which
i
can
lift
the
burthen
from
my
shoulders
i
must
stagger
on
to
the
end
with
the
pack
of
my
responsibility
i
can
not
shift
it
do
you
suppose
i
would
not
if
i
thought
i
could
i
can
not
can
not
can
not
and
let
that
suffice
the
rapture
was
all
gone
from
artwater
countenance
the
dark
apostle
had
disappeared
and
in
his
place
there
stood
an
easy
sneering
gentleman
who
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
it
was
pertly
done
and
the
blood
burned
in
herrick
face
do
you
mean
by
that
he
cried
shall
we
go
back
to
the
house
said
attwater
guests
will
soon
be
due
herrick
stood
his
ground
a
moment
with
clenched
fists
and
teeth
and
as
he
so
stood
the
fact
of
his
errand
there
slowly
swung
clear
in
front
of
him
like
the
moon
out
of
clouds
he
had
come
to
lure
that
man
on
board
he
was
failing
even
if
it
could
be
said
that
he
had
tried
he
was
sure
to
fail
now
and
knew
it
and
knew
it
was
better
so
and
what
was
to
be
next
with
a
groan
he
turned
to
follow
his
host
who
was
standing
with
polite
smile
and
instantly
and
somewhat
obsequiously
led
the
way
in
the
now
darkened
colonnade
of
palms
there
they
went
in
silence
the
earth
gave
up
richly
of
her
perfume
the
air
tasted
warm
and
aromatic
in
the
nostrils
and
from
a
great
way
forward
in
the
wood
the
brightness
of
lights
and
fire
marked
out
the
house
of
attwater
herrick
meanwhile
resolved
and
resisted
an
immense
temptation
to
go
up
to
touch
him
on
the
arm
and
breathe
a
word
in
his
ear
they
are
going
to
murder
you
there
would
be
one
life
saved
but
what
of
the
two
others
the
three
lives
went
up
and
down
before
him
like
buckets
in
a
well
or
like
the
scales
of
balances
it
had
come
to
a
choice
and
one
that
must
be
speedy
for
certain
invaluable
minutes
the
wheels
of
life
ran
before
him
and
he
could
still
divert
them
with
a
touch
to
the
one
side
or
the
other
still
choose
who
was
to
live
and
who
was
to
die
he
considered
the
men
attwater
intrigued
puzzled
dazzled
enchanted
and
revolted
him
alive
he
seemed
but
a
doubtful
good
and
the
thought
of
him
lying
dead
was
so
unwelcome
that
it
pursued
him
like
a
vision
with
every
circumstance
of
colour
and
sound
incessantly
he
had
before
him
the
image
of
that
great
mass
of
man
stricken
down
in
varying
attitudes
and
with
varying
wounds
fallen
prone
fallen
supine
fallen
on
his
side
or
clinging
to
a
doorpost
with
the
changing
face
and
the
relaxing
fingers
of
the
he
heard
the
click
of
the
trigger
the
thud
of
the
ball
the
cry
of
the
victim
he
saw
the
blood
flow
and
this
building
up
of
circumstance
was
like
a
consecration
of
the
man
till
he
seemed
to
walk
in
sacrificial
fillets
next
he
considered
davis
with
his
commonness
of
nature
his
indomitable
valour
and
mirth
in
the
old
days
of
their
starvation
the
endearing
blend
of
his
faults
and
virtues
the
sudden
shining
forth
of
a
tenderness
that
lay
too
deep
for
tears
his
children
adar
and
her
bowel
complaint
and
adar
doll
no
death
could
not
be
suffered
to
approach
that
head
even
in
fancy
with
a
general
heat
and
a
bracing
of
his
muscles
it
was
borne
in
on
herrick
that
adar
father
would
find
in
him
a
son
to
the
death
and
even
huish
showed
a
little
in
that
sacredness
by
the
tacit
adoption
of
daily
life
they
were
become
brothers
there
was
an
implied
bond
of
loyalty
in
their
cohabitation
of
the
ship
and
their
passed
miseries
to
which
herrick
must
be
a
little
true
or
wholly
dishonoured
horror
of
sudden
death
for
horror
of
sudden
death
there
was
here
no
hesitation
possible
it
must
be
attwater
and
no
sooner
was
the
thought
formed
which
was
a
sentence
than
his
whole
mind
of
man
ran
in
a
panic
to
the
other
side
and
when
he
looked
within
himself
he
was
aware
only
of
turbulence
and
inarticulate
outcry
in
all
this
there
was
no
thought
of
robert
herrick
he
had
complied
with
the
in
man
affairs
and
the
tide
had
carried
him
away
he
heard
already
the
roaring
of
the
maelstrom
that
must
hurry
him
under
and
in
his
bedevilled
and
dishonoured
soul
there
was
no
thought
of
self
for
how
long
he
walked
silent
by
his
companion
herrick
had
no
guess
the
clouds
rolled
suddenly
away
the
orgasm
was
over
he
found
himself
placid
with
the
placidity
of
despair
there
returned
to
him
the
power
of
commonplace
speech
and
he
heard
with
surprise
his
own
voice
say
a
lovely
evening
it
not
said
attwater
the
evenings
here
would
be
very
pleasant
if
one
had
anything
to
do
by
day
of
course
one
can
shoot
shoot
asked
herrick
i
am
what
you
would
call
a
fine
shot
said
attwater
is
faith
i
believe
my
balls
will
go
true
if
i
were
to
miss
once
it
would
spoil
me
for
nine
months
never
miss
then
said
herrick
unless
i
mean
to
said
attwater
to
miss
nicely
is
the
art
there
was
an
old
king
one
knew
in
the
western
islands
who
used
to
empty
a
winchester
all
round
a
man
and
stir
his
hair
or
nick
a
rag
out
of
his
clothes
with
every
ball
except
the
last
and
that
went
plump
between
the
eyes
it
was
pretty
practice
could
do
that
asked
herrick
with
a
sudden
chill
i
can
do
anything
returned
the
other
do
not
understand
what
must
be
must
they
were
now
come
near
to
the
back
part
of
the
house
one
of
the
men
was
engaged
about
the
cooking
fire
which
burned
with
the
clear
fierce
essential
radiance
of
cocoanut
shells
a
fragrance
of
strange
meats
was
in
the
air
all
round
in
the
verandahs
lamps
were
lighted
so
that
the
place
shone
abroad
in
the
dusk
of
the
trees
with
many
complicated
patterns
of
shadow
and
wash
your
hands
said
attwater
and
led
the
way
into
a
clean
matted
room
with
a
cot
bed
a
safe
or
shelf
or
two
of
books
in
a
glazed
case
and
an
iron
presently
he
cried
in
the
native
and
there
appeared
for
a
moment
in
the
doorway
a
plump
and
pretty
young
woman
with
a
clean
towel
cried
herrick
who
now
saw
for
the
first
time
the
fourth
survivor
of
the
pestilence
and
was
startled
by
the
recollection
of
the
captain
orders
said
attwater
whole
colony
lives
about
the
house
left
of
it
we
are
all
afraid
of
devils
if
you
please
and
taniera
and
she
sleep
in
the
front
parlour
and
the
other
boy
on
the
verandah
is
pretty
said
herrick
pretty
said
attwater
was
why
i
had
her
married
a
man
never
knows
when
he
may
be
inclined
to
be
a
fool
about
women
so
when
we
were
left
alone
i
had
the
pair
of
them
to
the
chapel
and
performed
the
ceremony
she
made
a
lot
of
fuss
i
do
not
take
at
all
the
romantic
view
of
marriage
he
explained
that
strikes
you
as
a
safeguard
asked
herrick
with
amazement
i
am
a
plain
man
and
very
literal
whom
god
hath
joined
together
are
the
words
i
fancy
so
one
married
them
and
respects
the
marriage
said
attwater
said
herrick
see
i
may
look
to
make
an
excellent
marriage
when
i
go
home
began
attwater
confidentially
am
rich
this
safe
alone
laying
his
hand
upon
it
be
a
moderate
fortune
when
i
have
the
time
to
place
the
pearls
upon
the
market
here
are
ten
years
accumulation
from
a
lagoon
where
i
have
had
as
many
as
ten
divers
going
all
day
long
and
i
went
further
than
people
usually
do
in
these
waters
for
i
rotted
a
lot
of
shell
and
did
splendidly
would
you
like
to
see
them
this
confirmation
of
the
captain
guess
hit
herrick
hard
and
he
contained
himself
with
difficulty
thank
you
i
think
not
said
he
do
not
care
for
pearls
i
am
very
indifferent
to
all
these
suggested
attwater
yet
i
believe
you
ought
to
cast
an
eye
on
my
collection
which
is
really
unique
and
which
oh
it
is
the
case
with
all
of
us
and
everything
about
us
hangs
by
a
hair
today
it
groweth
up
and
flourisheth
tomorrow
it
is
cut
down
and
cast
into
the
oven
today
it
is
here
and
together
in
this
safe
tomorrow
tonight
it
may
be
scattered
thou
fool
this
night
thy
soul
shall
be
required
of
thee
do
not
understand
you
said
herrick
said
attwater
seem
to
speak
in
riddles
said
herrick
unsteadily
do
not
understand
what
manner
of
man
you
are
nor
what
you
are
driving
at
attwater
stood
with
his
hands
upon
his
hips
and
his
head
bent
forward
am
a
fatalist
he
replied
just
now
if
you
insist
on
it
an
experimentalist
talking
of
which
by
the
bye
who
painted
out
the
schooner
name
he
said
with
mocking
softness
do
you
know
one
thinks
it
should
be
done
again
it
can
still
be
partly
read
and
whatever
is
worth
doing
is
surely
worth
doing
well
you
think
with
me
that
is
so
nice
well
shall
we
step
on
the
verandah
i
have
a
dry
sherry
that
i
would
like
your
opinion
of
herrick
followed
him
forth
to
where
under
the
light
of
the
hanging
lamps
the
table
shone
with
napery
and
crystal
followed
him
as
the
criminal
goes
with
the
hangman
or
the
sheep
with
the
butcher
took
the
sherry
mechanically
drank
it
and
spoke
mechanical
words
of
praise
the
object
of
his
terror
had
become
suddenly
inverted
till
then
he
had
seen
attwater
trussed
and
gagged
a
helpless
victim
and
had
longed
to
run
in
and
save
him
he
saw
him
now
tower
up
mysterious
and
menacing
the
angel
of
the
lord
wrath
armed
with
knowledge
and
threatening
judgment
he
set
down
his
glass
again
and
was
surprised
to
see
it
empty
go
always
armed
he
said
and
the
next
moment
could
have
plucked
his
tongue
out
said
attwater
have
been
through
a
mutiny
here
that
was
one
of
my
incidents
of
missionary
life
and
just
then
the
sound
of
voices
reached
them
and
looking
forth
from
the
verandah
they
saw
huish
and
the
captain
drawing
near
chapter
the
dinner
party
they
sat
down
to
an
island
dinner
remarkable
for
its
variety
and
excellence
turtle
soup
and
steak
fish
fowls
a
sucking
pig
a
cocoanut
salad
and
sprouting
cocoanut
roasted
for
dessert
not
a
tin
had
been
opened
and
save
for
the
oil
and
vinegar
in
the
salad
and
some
green
spears
of
onion
which
attwater
cultivated
and
plucked
with
his
own
hand
not
even
the
condiments
were
european
sherry
hock
and
claret
succeeded
each
other
and
the
farallone
champagne
brought
up
the
rear
with
the
dessert
it
was
plain
that
like
so
many
of
the
extremely
religious
in
the
days
before
teetotalism
attwater
had
a
dash
of
the
epicure
for
such
characters
it
is
softening
to
eat
well
doubly
so
to
have
designed
and
had
prepared
an
excellent
meal
for
others
and
the
manners
of
their
host
were
agreeably
mollified
in
consequence
a
cat
of
huge
growth
sat
on
his
shoulders
purring
and
occasionally
with
a
deft
paw
capturing
a
morsel
in
the
air
to
a
cat
he
might
be
likened
himself
as
he
lolled
at
the
head
of
his
table
dealing
out
attentions
and
innuendoes
and
using
the
velvet
and
the
claw
indifferently
and
both
huish
and
the
captain
fell
progressively
under
the
charm
of
his
hospitable
freedom
over
the
third
guest
the
incidents
of
the
dinner
may
be
said
to
have
passed
for
long
unheeded
herrick
accepted
all
that
was
offered
him
ate
and
drank
without
tasting
and
heard
without
comprehension
his
mind
was
singly
occupied
in
contemplating
the
horror
of
the
circumstances
in
which
he
sat
what
attwater
knew
what
the
captain
designed
from
which
side
treachery
was
to
be
first
expected
these
were
the
ground
of
his
thoughts
there
were
times
when
he
longed
to
throw
down
the
table
and
flee
into
the
night
and
even
that
was
debarred
him
to
do
anything
to
say
anything
to
move
at
all
were
only
to
precipitate
the
barbarous
tragedy
and
he
sat
spellbound
eating
with
white
lips
two
of
his
companions
observed
him
narrowly
attwater
with
raking
sidelong
glances
that
did
not
interrupt
his
talk
the
captain
with
a
heavy
and
anxious
consideration
i
must
say
this
sherry
is
a
really
prime
article
said
huish
much
does
it
stand
you
in
if
it
a
fair
question
hundred
and
twelve
shillings
in
london
and
the
freight
to
valparaiso
and
on
again
said
attwater
strikes
one
as
really
not
a
bad
fluid
and
twelve
murmured
the
clerk
relishing
the
wine
and
the
figures
in
a
common
ecstasy
my
glad
you
like
it
said
attwater
yourself
mr
whish
and
keep
the
bottle
by
you
friend
name
is
huish
and
not
whish
sit
said
the
captain
with
a
flush
beg
your
pardon
i
am
sure
huish
and
not
whish
certainly
said
attwater
was
about
to
say
that
i
have
still
eight
dozen
he
added
fixing
the
captain
with
his
eye
dozen
what
said
davis
was
the
reply
dozen
excellent
sherry
why
it
seems
almost
worth
it
in
itself
to
a
man
fond
of
wine
the
ambiguous
words
struck
home
to
guilty
consciences
and
huish
and
the
captain
sat
up
in
their
places
and
regarded
him
with
a
scare
what
said
davis
hundred
and
twelve
shillings
replied
attwater
the
captain
breathed
hard
for
a
moment
he
reached
out
far
and
wide
to
find
any
coherency
in
these
remarks
then
with
a
great
effort
changed
the
subject
allow
we
are
about
the
first
white
men
upon
this
island
sir
said
he
attwater
followed
him
at
once
and
with
entire
gravity
to
the
new
ground
and
dr
symonds
excepted
i
should
say
the
only
ones
he
returned
yet
who
can
tell
in
the
course
of
the
ages
someone
may
have
lived
here
and
we
sometimes
think
that
someone
must
the
cocoa
palms
grow
all
round
the
island
which
is
scarce
like
nature
planting
we
found
besides
when
we
landed
an
unmistakable
cairn
upon
the
beach
use
unknown
but
probably
erected
in
the
hope
of
gratifying
some
mumbo
jumbo
whose
very
name
is
forgotten
by
some
gentry
whose
very
bones
are
lost
then
the
island
witness
the
directory
has
been
twice
reported
and
since
my
tenancy
we
have
had
two
wrecks
both
derelict
the
rest
is
conjecture
symonds
is
your
partner
i
guess
said
davis
dear
fellow
symonds
how
he
would
regret
it
if
he
knew
you
had
been
here
said
attwater
on
the
trinity
ai
he
asked
huish
if
you
could
tell
me
where
the
trinity
was
you
would
confer
a
favour
mr
whish
was
the
reply
suppose
she
has
a
native
crew
said
davis
the
secret
has
been
kept
ten
years
one
would
suppose
she
had
replied
attwater
now
see
said
huish
have
everything
about
you
in
no
end
style
and
no
mistake
but
i
tell
you
it
would
do
for
me
too
much
of
the
old
rustic
bridge
by
the
mill
too
retired
by
give
me
the
sound
of
bow
bells
must
not
think
it
was
always
so
replied
attwater
was
once
a
busy
shore
although
now
hark
you
can
hear
the
solitude
i
find
it
stimulating
and
talking
of
the
sound
of
bells
kindly
follow
a
little
experiment
of
mine
in
silence
there
was
a
silver
bell
at
his
right
hand
to
call
the
servants
he
made
them
a
sign
to
stand
still
struck
the
bell
with
force
and
leaned
eagerly
forward
the
note
rose
clear
and
strong
it
rang
out
clear
and
far
into
the
night
and
over
the
deserted
island
it
died
into
the
distance
until
there
only
lingered
in
the
porches
of
the
ear
a
vibration
that
was
sound
no
longer
houses
empty
sea
solitary
beaches
said
attwater
yet
god
hears
the
bell
and
yet
we
sit
in
this
verandah
on
a
lighted
stage
with
all
heaven
for
spectators
and
you
call
that
solitude
there
followed
a
bar
of
silence
during
which
the
captain
sat
mesmerised
then
attwater
laughed
softly
are
the
diversions
of
a
lonely
man
he
resumed
possibly
not
in
good
taste
one
tells
oneself
these
little
fairy
tales
for
company
if
there
should
happen
to
be
anything
in
mr
hay
but
here
comes
the
claret
one
does
not
offer
you
lafitte
captain
because
i
believe
it
is
all
sold
to
the
railroad
dining
cars
in
your
great
country
but
this
is
of
a
good
year
and
mr
whish
will
give
me
news
of
it
a
queer
idea
of
yours
cried
the
captain
bursting
with
a
sigh
from
the
spell
that
had
bound
him
you
mean
to
tell
me
now
that
you
sit
here
evenings
and
ring
up
well
ring
on
the
angels
by
yourself
a
matter
of
historic
fact
and
since
you
put
it
directly
one
does
not
said
attwater
ring
a
bell
when
there
flows
out
from
oneself
and
everything
about
one
a
far
more
momentous
silence
the
least
beat
of
my
heart
and
the
least
thought
in
my
mind
echoing
into
eternity
for
ever
and
for
ever
and
for
ever
look
said
huish
down
the
lights
at
once
and
the
band
of
will
oblige
this
ai
a
spiritual
seance
about
mr
whish
i
beg
your
pardon
captain
huish
not
whish
of
course
said
attwater
as
the
boy
was
filling
huish
glass
the
bottle
escaped
from
his
hand
and
was
shattered
and
the
wine
spilt
on
the
verandah
floor
instant
grimness
as
of
death
appeared
on
the
face
of
attwater
he
smote
the
bell
imperiously
and
the
two
brown
natives
fell
into
the
attitude
of
attention
and
stood
mute
and
trembling
there
was
just
a
moment
of
silence
and
hard
looks
then
followed
a
few
savage
words
in
the
native
and
upon
a
gesture
of
dismissal
the
service
proceeded
as
before
none
of
the
party
had
as
yet
observed
upon
the
excellent
bearing
of
the
two
men
they
were
dark
undersized
and
well
set
up
stepped
softly
waited
deftly
brought
on
the
wines
and
dishes
at
a
look
and
their
eyes
attended
studiously
on
their
master
do
you
get
your
labour
from
anyway
asked
davis
where
not
answered
attwater
much
of
a
soft
job
i
suppose
said
the
captain
you
will
tell
me
where
getting
labour
is
said
attwater
with
a
shrug
of
course
in
our
case
as
we
could
name
no
destination
we
had
to
go
far
and
wide
and
do
the
best
we
could
we
have
gone
as
far
west
as
the
kingsmills
and
as
far
south
as
pity
symonds
here
he
is
full
of
yarns
that
was
his
part
to
collect
them
then
began
mine
which
was
the
educational
mean
to
run
them
said
davis
to
run
them
said
attwater
a
bit
said
davis
out
of
my
depth
how
was
this
do
you
mean
to
say
you
did
it
did
it
said
attwater
there
was
nobody
to
help
one
god
but
you
must
be
a
holy
terror
cried
the
captain
in
a
glow
of
admiration
does
one
best
said
attwater
now
said
davis
have
seen
a
lot
of
driving
in
my
time
and
been
counted
a
good
driver
myself
i
fought
my
way
third
mate
round
the
cape
horn
with
a
push
of
packet
rats
that
would
have
turned
the
devil
out
of
hell
and
shut
the
door
on
him
and
i
tell
you
this
racket
of
mr
attwater
takes
the
cake
in
a
ship
why
there
ai
nothing
to
it
you
got
the
law
with
you
that
what
does
it
but
put
me
down
on
this
blame
beach
alone
with
nothing
but
a
whip
and
a
mouthful
of
bad
words
and
ask
me
to
no
sir
it
not
good
enough
i
have
got
the
sand
for
that
cried
davis
the
law
behind
he
added
the
law
does
it
every
time
beak
ai
as
black
as
he
sometimes
pynted
observed
huish
humorously
one
got
the
law
after
a
fashion
said
attwater
had
to
be
a
number
of
things
it
was
sometimes
rather
a
bore
should
smile
said
davis
lively
i
should
think
dare
say
we
mean
the
same
thing
said
attwater
one
way
or
another
one
got
it
knocked
into
their
heads
that
they
must
work
and
they
did
until
the
lord
took
them
you
made
jump
said
huish
it
was
necessary
mr
whish
i
made
them
jump
said
attwater
bet
you
did
cried
the
captain
he
was
a
good
deal
flushed
but
not
so
much
with
wine
as
admiration
and
his
eyes
drank
in
the
huge
proportions
of
the
other
with
delight
bet
you
did
and
you
bet
that
i
can
see
you
doing
it
by
god
you
a
man
and
you
can
say
i
said
so
good
of
you
i
sure
said
attwater
you
did
you
ever
have
crime
here
asked
herrick
breaking
his
silence
with
a
pungent
voice
said
attwater
did
how
did
you
handle
that
sir
cried
the
eager
captain
you
see
it
was
a
queer
case
replied
attwater
was
a
case
that
would
have
puzzled
solomon
shall
i
tell
it
you
yes
the
captain
rapturously
accepted
drawled
attwater
is
what
it
was
i
dare
say
you
know
two
types
of
natives
which
may
be
called
the
obsequious
and
the
sullen
well
one
had
them
the
types
themselves
detected
in
the
fact
and
one
had
them
together
obsequiousness
ran
out
of
the
first
like
wine
out
of
a
bottle
sullenness
congested
in
the
second
obsequiousness
was
all
smiles
he
ran
to
catch
your
eye
he
loved
to
gabble
and
he
had
about
a
dozen
words
of
beach
english
and
an
veneer
of
christianity
sullens
was
industrious
a
big
bee
when
he
was
spoken
to
he
answered
with
a
black
look
and
a
shrug
of
one
shoulder
but
the
thing
would
be
done
i
do
give
him
to
you
for
a
model
of
manners
there
was
nothing
showy
about
sullens
but
he
was
strong
and
steady
and
ungraciously
obedient
now
sullens
got
into
trouble
no
matter
how
the
regulations
of
the
place
were
broken
and
he
was
punished
accordingly
without
effect
so
the
next
day
and
the
next
and
the
day
after
till
i
began
to
be
weary
of
the
business
and
sullens
i
am
afraid
particularly
so
there
came
a
day
when
he
was
in
fault
again
for
the
oh
perhaps
the
thirtieth
time
and
he
rolled
a
dull
eye
upon
me
with
a
spark
in
it
and
appeared
to
speak
now
the
regulations
of
the
place
are
formal
upon
one
point
we
allow
no
explanations
none
are
received
none
allowed
to
be
offered
so
one
stopped
him
instantly
but
made
a
note
of
the
circumstance
the
next
day
he
was
gone
from
the
settlement
there
could
be
nothing
more
annoying
if
the
labour
took
to
running
away
the
fishery
was
wrecked
there
are
sixty
miles
of
this
island
you
see
all
in
length
like
the
queen
highway
the
idea
of
pursuit
in
such
a
place
was
a
piece
of
childishness
which
one
did
not
entertain
two
days
later
i
made
a
discovery
it
came
in
upon
me
with
a
flash
that
sullens
had
been
unjustly
punished
from
beginning
to
end
and
the
real
culprit
throughout
had
been
obsequiousness
the
native
who
talks
like
the
woman
who
hesitates
is
lost
you
set
him
talking
and
lying
and
he
talks
and
lies
and
watches
your
face
to
see
if
he
has
pleased
you
till
at
last
out
comes
the
truth
it
came
out
of
obsequiousness
in
the
regular
course
i
said
nothing
to
him
i
dismissed
him
and
late
as
it
was
for
it
was
already
night
set
off
to
look
for
sullens
i
had
not
far
to
go
about
two
hundred
yards
up
the
island
the
moon
showed
him
to
me
he
was
hanging
in
a
cocoa
palm
i
not
botanist
enough
to
tell
you
how
but
it
the
way
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
these
natives
commit
suicide
his
tongue
was
out
poor
devil
and
the
birds
had
got
at
him
i
spare
you
details
he
was
an
ugly
sight
i
gave
the
business
six
good
hours
of
thinking
in
this
verandah
my
justice
had
been
made
a
fool
of
i
suppose
that
i
was
ever
angrier
next
day
i
had
the
conch
sounded
and
all
hands
out
before
sunrise
one
took
one
gun
and
led
the
way
with
obsequiousness
he
was
very
talkative
the
beggar
supposed
that
all
was
right
now
he
had
confessed
in
the
old
schoolboy
phrase
he
was
plainly
up
to
me
full
of
protestations
of
goodwill
and
good
behaviour
to
which
one
answered
one
really
ca
remember
what
presently
the
tree
came
in
sight
and
the
hanged
man
they
all
burst
out
lamenting
for
their
comrade
in
the
island
way
and
obsequiousness
was
the
loudest
of
the
mourners
he
was
quite
genuine
a
noxious
creature
without
any
consciousness
of
guilt
well
presently
to
make
a
long
story
short
one
told
him
to
go
up
the
tree
he
stared
a
bit
looked
at
one
with
a
trouble
in
his
eye
and
had
rather
a
sickly
smile
but
went
he
was
obedient
to
the
last
he
had
all
the
pretty
virtues
but
the
truth
was
not
in
him
so
soon
as
he
was
up
he
looked
down
and
there
was
the
rifle
covering
him
and
at
that
he
gave
a
whimper
like
a
dog
you
could
bear
a
pin
drop
no
more
keening
now
there
they
all
crouched
upon
the
ground
with
bulging
eyes
there
was
he
in
the
tree
top
the
colour
of
the
lead
and
between
was
the
dead
man
dancing
a
bit
in
the
air
he
was
obedient
to
the
last
recited
his
crime
recommended
his
soul
to
god
and
then
attwater
paused
and
herrick
who
had
been
listening
attentively
made
a
convulsive
movement
which
upset
his
glass
then
said
the
breathless
captain
said
attwater
came
to
ground
together
herrick
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
shriek
and
an
insensate
gesture
was
a
murder
he
screamed
murder
you
monstrous
being
murderer
and
hypocrite
murderer
and
hypocrite
murderer
and
hypocrite
he
repeated
and
his
tongue
stumbled
among
the
words
the
captain
was
by
him
in
a
moment
he
cried
yourself
here
do
be
a
blame
fool
herrick
struggled
in
his
embrace
like
a
frantic
child
and
suddenly
bowing
his
face
in
his
hands
choked
into
a
sob
the
first
of
many
which
now
convulsed
his
body
silently
and
now
jerked
from
him
indescribable
and
meaningless
sounds
friend
appears
remarked
attwater
sitting
unmoved
but
all
alert
at
table
must
be
the
wine
replied
the
captain
ai
no
drinking
man
you
see
i
i
think
i
take
him
away
a
walk
sober
him
up
i
guess
he
led
him
without
resistance
out
of
the
verandah
and
into
the
night
in
which
they
soon
melted
but
still
for
some
time
as
they
drew
away
his
comfortable
voice
was
to
be
heard
soothing
and
remonstrating
and
herrick
answering
at
intervals
with
the
mechanical
noises
of
hysteria
like
a
bloomin
poultry
yard
observed
huish
helping
himself
to
wine
of
which
he
spilled
a
good
deal
with
gentlemanly
ease
man
should
learn
to
beyave
at
table
he
added
bad
form
is
it
not
said
attwater
well
we
are
left
a
glass
of
wine
with
you
mr
whish
chapter
the
open
door
the
captain
and
herrick
meanwhile
turned
their
back
upon
the
lights
in
attwater
verandah
and
took
a
direction
towards
the
pier
and
the
beach
of
the
lagoon
the
isle
at
this
hour
with
its
smooth
floor
of
sand
the
pillared
roof
overhead
and
the
prevalent
illumination
of
the
lamps
wore
an
air
of
unreality
like
a
deserted
theatre
or
a
public
garden
at
midnight
a
man
looked
about
him
for
the
statues
and
tables
not
the
least
air
of
wind
was
stirring
among
the
palms
and
the
silence
was
emphasised
by
the
continuous
clamour
of
the
surf
from
the
seashore
as
it
might
be
of
traffic
in
the
next
street
still
talking
still
soothing
him
the
captain
hurried
his
patient
on
brought
him
at
last
to
the
and
leading
him
down
the
beach
laved
his
head
and
face
with
the
tepid
water
the
paroxysm
gradually
subsided
the
sobs
became
less
convulsive
and
then
ceased
by
an
odd
but
not
quite
unnatural
conjunction
the
captain
soothing
current
of
talk
died
away
at
the
same
time
and
by
proportional
steps
and
the
pair
remained
sunk
in
silence
the
lagoon
broke
at
their
feet
in
petty
wavelets
and
with
a
sound
as
delicate
as
a
whisper
stars
of
all
degrees
looked
down
on
their
own
images
in
that
vast
mirror
and
the
more
angry
colour
of
the
farallone
riding
lamp
burned
in
the
middle
distance
for
long
they
continued
to
gaze
on
the
scene
before
them
and
hearken
anxiously
to
the
rustle
and
tinkle
of
that
miniature
surf
or
the
more
distant
and
loud
reverberations
from
the
outer
coast
for
long
speech
was
denied
them
and
when
the
words
came
at
last
they
came
to
both
simultaneously
herrick
captain
was
beginning
but
herrick
turning
swiftly
towards
his
companion
bent
him
down
with
the
eager
cry
up
anchor
captain
and
to
sea
to
my
son
said
the
captain
anchor
easy
saying
but
where
to
sea
responded
herrick
sea
big
enough
to
sea
away
from
this
dreadful
island
and
that
oh
that
sinister
man
we
see
about
that
said
davis
brace
up
and
we
see
about
that
you
all
run
down
that
what
wrong
with
you
all
nerves
like
jemimar
you
got
to
brace
up
good
and
be
yourself
again
and
then
we
talk
sea
reiterated
herrick
sea
tonight
now
this
moment
ca
be
my
son
replied
the
captain
firmly
ship
of
mine
puts
to
sea
without
provisions
you
can
take
that
for
settled
do
seem
to
understand
said
herrick
whole
thing
is
over
i
tell
you
there
is
nothing
to
do
here
when
he
knows
all
that
man
there
with
the
cat
knows
all
ca
you
take
it
in
what
asked
the
captain
visibly
discomposed
he
received
us
like
a
perfect
gentleman
and
treated
us
real
handsome
until
you
began
with
your
foolery
and
i
must
say
i
seen
men
shot
for
less
and
nobody
sorry
what
more
do
you
expect
anyway
herrick
rocked
to
and
fro
upon
the
sand
shaking
his
head
us
he
said
was
guying
us
only
guying
us
it
all
good
for
was
one
queer
thing
to
be
sure
admitted
the
captain
with
a
misgiving
of
the
voice
about
the
sherry
damned
if
i
caught
on
to
that
say
herrick
you
did
give
me
away
give
you
away
repeated
herrick
with
weary
querulous
scorn
was
there
to
give
away
we
transparent
we
got
rascal
branded
on
us
detected
rascal
detected
rascal
why
before
he
came
on
board
there
was
the
name
painted
out
and
he
saw
the
whole
thing
he
made
sure
we
would
kill
him
there
and
then
and
stood
guying
you
and
huish
on
the
chance
he
calls
that
being
frightened
next
he
had
me
ashore
a
fine
time
i
had
the
two
wolves
he
calls
you
and
what
is
the
puppy
doing
with
the
two
wolves
he
asked
he
showed
me
his
pearls
he
said
they
might
be
dispersed
before
morning
and
all
hung
by
a
hair
and
smiled
as
he
said
it
such
a
smile
o
it
no
use
i
tell
you
he
knows
all
he
sees
through
all
we
only
make
him
laugh
with
our
pretences
he
looks
at
us
and
laughs
like
god
there
was
a
silence
davis
stood
with
contorted
brows
gazing
into
the
night
pearls
he
said
suddenly
showed
them
to
you
he
has
them
he
did
show
them
i
forgot
only
the
safe
they
were
in
said
herrick
you
never
get
them
two
words
to
say
to
that
said
the
captain
you
think
he
would
have
been
so
easy
at
table
unless
he
was
prepared
cried
herrick
servants
were
both
armed
he
was
armed
himself
he
always
is
he
told
me
you
will
never
deceive
his
vigilance
davis
i
know
it
it
all
up
all
up
there
nothing
for
it
nothing
to
be
done
all
gone
life
honour
love
oh
my
god
my
god
why
was
i
born
another
pause
followed
upon
this
outburst
the
captain
put
his
hands
to
his
brow
thing
he
broke
out
did
he
tell
you
all
this
seems
like
madness
to
me
herrick
shook
his
head
with
gloomy
iteration
would
understand
if
i
were
to
tell
you
said
he
guess
i
can
understand
any
blame
thing
that
you
can
tell
me
said
the
captain
then
he
a
fatalist
said
herrick
that
a
fatalist
said
davis
it
a
fellow
that
believes
a
lot
of
things
said
herrick
that
his
bullets
go
true
believes
that
all
falls
out
as
god
chooses
do
as
you
like
to
prevent
it
and
all
that
i
guess
i
believe
right
so
myself
said
davis
do
said
herrick
bet
i
do
says
davis
herrick
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
must
be
a
fool
said
he
and
he
leaned
his
head
upon
his
knees
the
captain
stood
biting
his
hands
one
thing
sure
he
said
at
last
must
get
huish
out
of
that
he
not
fit
to
hold
his
end
up
with
a
man
like
you
describe
and
he
turned
to
go
away
the
words
had
been
quite
simple
not
so
the
tone
and
the
other
was
quick
to
catch
it
he
cried
do
do
it
spare
me
and
do
do
it
spare
yourself
and
leave
it
alone
for
god
sake
for
your
children
sake
his
voice
rose
to
a
passionate
shrillness
another
moment
and
he
might
be
overheard
by
their
not
distant
victim
but
davis
turned
on
him
with
a
savage
oath
and
gesture
and
the
miserable
young
man
rolled
over
on
his
face
on
the
sand
and
lay
speechless
and
helpless
the
captain
meanwhile
set
out
rapidly
for
attwater
house
as
he
went
he
considered
with
himself
eagerly
his
thoughts
racing
the
man
had
understood
he
had
mocked
them
from
the
beginning
he
would
teach
him
to
make
a
mockery
of
john
davis
herrick
thought
him
a
god
give
him
a
second
to
aim
in
and
the
god
was
overthrown
he
chuckled
as
he
felt
the
butt
of
his
revolver
it
should
be
done
now
as
he
went
in
from
behind
it
was
difficult
to
get
there
from
across
the
table
no
the
captain
preferred
to
shoot
standing
so
as
you
could
be
sure
to
get
your
hand
upon
your
gun
the
best
would
be
to
summon
huish
and
when
attwater
stood
up
and
turned
ah
then
would
be
the
moment
wrapped
in
his
ardent
prefiguration
of
events
the
captain
posted
towards
the
house
with
his
head
down
up
halt
cried
the
voice
of
attwater
and
the
captain
before
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
had
obeyed
the
surprise
was
complete
and
irremediable
coming
on
the
top
crest
of
his
murderous
intentions
he
had
walked
straight
into
an
ambuscade
and
now
stood
with
his
hands
impotently
lifted
staring
at
the
verandah
the
party
was
now
broken
up
attwater
leaned
on
a
post
and
kept
davis
covered
with
a
winchester
one
of
the
servants
was
hard
by
with
a
second
at
the
port
arms
leaning
a
little
forward
with
eager
expectancy
in
the
open
space
at
the
head
of
the
stair
huish
was
partly
supported
by
the
other
native
his
face
wreathed
in
meaningless
smiles
his
mind
seemingly
sunk
in
the
contemplation
of
an
unlighted
cigar
said
attwater
seem
to
me
to
be
a
very
twopenny
pirate
the
captain
uttered
a
sound
in
his
throat
for
which
we
have
no
name
rage
choked
him
am
going
to
give
you
mr
whish
or
the
that
remains
of
him
continued
attwater
talks
a
great
deal
when
he
drinks
captain
davis
of
the
sea
ranger
but
i
have
quite
done
with
him
and
return
the
article
with
thanks
now
he
cried
sharply
false
movement
like
that
and
your
family
will
have
to
deplore
the
loss
of
an
invaluable
parent
keep
strictly
still
davis
attwater
said
a
word
in
the
native
his
eye
still
undeviatingly
fixed
on
the
captain
and
the
servant
thrust
huish
smartly
forward
from
the
brink
of
the
stair
with
an
extraordinary
simultaneous
dispersion
of
his
members
that
gentleman
bounded
forth
into
space
struck
the
earth
ricocheted
and
brought
up
with
his
arms
about
a
palm
his
mind
was
quite
a
stranger
to
these
events
the
expression
of
anguish
that
deformed
his
countenance
at
the
moment
of
the
leap
was
probably
mechanical
and
he
suffered
these
convulsions
in
silence
clung
to
the
tree
like
an
infant
and
seemed
by
his
dips
to
suppose
himself
engaged
in
the
pastime
of
bobbing
for
apples
a
more
finely
sympathetic
mind
or
a
more
observant
eye
might
have
remarked
a
little
in
front
of
him
on
the
sand
and
still
quite
beyond
reach
the
unlighted
cigar
is
your
whitechapel
carrion
said
attwater
now
you
might
very
well
ask
me
why
i
do
not
put
a
period
to
you
at
once
as
you
deserve
i
will
tell
you
why
davis
it
is
because
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
sea
ranger
and
the
people
you
drowned
or
the
farallone
and
the
champagne
that
you
stole
that
is
your
account
with
god
he
keeps
it
and
he
will
settle
it
when
the
clock
strikes
in
my
own
case
i
have
nothing
to
go
on
but
suspicion
and
i
do
not
kill
on
suspicion
not
even
vermin
like
you
but
understand
if
ever
i
see
any
of
you
again
it
is
another
matter
and
you
shall
eat
a
bullet
and
now
take
yourself
off
march
and
as
you
value
what
you
call
your
life
keep
your
hands
up
as
you
go
the
captain
remained
as
he
was
his
hands
up
his
mouth
open
mesmerised
with
fury
said
attwater
two
three
and
davis
turned
and
passed
slowly
away
but
even
as
he
went
he
was
meditating
a
prompt
offensive
return
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
he
had
leaped
behind
a
tree
and
was
crouching
there
pistol
in
hand
peering
from
either
side
of
his
place
of
ambush
with
bared
teeth
a
serpent
already
poised
to
strike
and
already
he
was
too
late
attwater
and
his
servants
had
disappeared
and
only
the
lamps
shone
on
the
deserted
table
and
the
bright
sand
about
the
house
and
threw
into
the
night
in
all
directions
the
strong
and
tall
shadows
of
the
palms
davis
ground
his
teeth
where
were
they
gone
the
cowards
to
what
hole
had
they
retreated
beyond
reach
it
was
in
vain
he
should
try
anything
he
single
and
with
a
revolver
against
three
persons
armed
with
winchesters
and
who
did
not
show
an
ear
out
of
any
of
the
apertures
of
that
lighted
and
silent
house
some
of
them
might
have
already
ducked
below
it
from
the
rear
and
be
drawing
a
bead
upon
him
at
that
moment
from
the
crypt
the
receptacle
of
empty
bottles
and
broken
crockery
no
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
bring
away
if
it
were
still
possible
his
shattered
and
demoralised
forces
he
said
along
lose
my
ciga
said
huish
reaching
vaguely
forward
the
captain
let
out
a
rasping
oath
right
along
here
said
he
all
righ
sleep
here
go
boar
replied
the
festive
one
you
do
come
and
come
now
by
the
living
god
i
shoot
you
cried
the
captain
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
sense
of
these
words
in
any
way
penetrated
to
the
mind
of
hulsh
rather
that
in
a
fresh
attempt
upon
the
cigar
he
overbalanced
himself
and
came
flying
erratically
forward
a
course
which
brought
him
within
reach
of
davis
you
walk
straight
said
the
captain
clutching
him
i
know
why
not
lose
my
ciga
replied
huish
the
captain
contained
fury
blazed
up
for
a
moment
he
twisted
huish
round
grasped
him
by
the
neck
of
the
coat
ran
him
in
front
of
him
to
the
pier
end
and
flung
him
savagely
forward
on
his
face
for
your
cigar
then
you
swine
said
he
and
blew
his
boat
call
till
the
pea
in
it
ceased
to
rattle
an
immediate
activity
responded
on
board
the
farallone
far
away
voices
and
soon
the
sound
of
oars
floated
along
the
surface
of
the
lagoon
and
at
the
same
time
from
nearer
hand
herrick
aroused
himself
and
strolled
languidly
up
he
bent
over
the
insignificant
figure
of
huish
where
it
grovelled
apparently
insensible
at
the
base
of
the
he
asked
he
not
dead
said
davis
attwater
asked
herrick
you
just
shut
your
head
replied
davis
can
do
that
i
fancy
and
by
god
i
show
you
how
i
stand
no
more
of
your
drivel
they
waited
accordingly
in
silence
till
the
boat
bumped
on
the
furthest
piers
then
raised
huish
head
and
heels
carried
him
down
the
gangway
and
flung
him
summarily
in
the
bottom
on
the
way
out
he
was
heard
murmuring
of
the
loss
of
his
cigar
and
after
he
had
been
handed
up
the
side
like
baggage
and
cast
down
in
the
alleyway
to
slumber
his
last
audible
expression
was
fl
attwa
this
the
expert
construed
into
fellow
attwater
with
so
much
innocence
had
this
great
spirit
issued
from
the
adventures
of
the
evening
the
captain
went
and
walked
in
the
waist
with
brief
irate
turns
herrick
leaned
his
arms
on
the
taffrail
the
crew
had
all
turned
in
the
ship
had
a
gentle
cradling
motion
at
times
a
block
piped
like
a
bird
on
shore
through
the
colonnade
of
palm
stems
attwater
house
was
to
be
seen
shining
steadily
with
many
lamps
and
there
was
nothing
else
visible
whether
in
the
heaven
above
or
in
the
lagoon
below
but
the
stars
and
their
reflections
it
might
have
been
minutes
or
it
might
have
been
hours
that
herrick
leaned
there
looking
in
the
glorified
water
and
drinking
peace
bath
of
stars
he
was
thinking
when
a
hand
was
laid
at
last
on
his
shoulder
said
the
captain
been
walking
off
my
trouble
a
sharp
jar
passed
through
the
young
man
but
he
neither
answered
nor
so
much
as
turned
his
head
guess
i
spoke
a
little
rough
to
you
on
shore
pursued
the
captain
fact
is
i
was
real
mad
but
now
it
over
and
you
and
me
have
to
turn
to
and
think
will
not
think
said
herrick
old
man
said
davis
kindly
wo
fight
you
know
got
to
brace
up
and
help
me
get
things
straight
you
not
going
back
on
a
friend
that
not
like
you
herrick
yes
it
is
said
herrick
come
said
the
captain
and
paused
as
if
quite
at
a
loss
here
he
cried
have
a
glass
of
champagne
i
wo
touch
it
so
that
show
you
if
i
in
earnest
but
it
just
the
for
you
it
put
an
edge
on
you
at
once
you
leave
me
alone
said
herrick
and
turned
away
the
captain
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
and
he
shook
him
off
and
turned
on
him
for
the
moment
like
a
demoniac
to
hell
in
your
own
way
he
cried
and
he
turned
away
again
this
time
unchecked
and
stepped
forward
to
where
the
boat
rocked
alongside
and
ground
occasionally
against
the
schooner
he
looked
about
him
a
corner
of
the
house
was
interposed
between
the
captain
and
himself
all
was
well
no
eye
must
see
him
in
that
last
act
he
slid
silently
into
the
boat
thence
silently
into
the
starry
water
instinctively
he
swam
a
little
it
would
be
time
enough
to
stop
by
and
by
the
shock
of
the
immersion
brightened
his
mind
immediately
the
events
of
the
ignoble
day
passed
before
him
in
a
frieze
of
pictures
and
he
thanked
gods
there
be
for
that
open
door
of
suicide
in
such
a
little
while
he
would
be
done
with
it
the
random
business
at
an
end
the
prodigal
son
come
home
a
very
bright
planet
shone
before
him
and
drew
a
trenchant
wake
along
the
water
he
took
that
for
his
line
and
followed
it
that
was
the
last
earthly
thing
that
he
should
look
upon
that
radiant
speck
which
he
had
soon
magnified
into
a
city
of
laputa
along
whose
terraces
there
walked
men
and
women
of
awful
and
benignant
features
who
viewed
him
with
distant
commiseration
these
imaginary
spectators
consoled
him
he
told
himself
their
talk
one
to
another
it
was
of
himself
and
his
sad
destiny
from
such
flights
of
fancy
he
was
aroused
by
the
growing
coldness
of
the
water
why
should
he
delay
here
where
he
was
now
let
him
drop
the
curtain
let
him
seek
the
ineffable
refuge
let
him
lie
down
with
all
races
and
generations
of
men
in
the
house
of
sleep
it
was
easy
to
say
easy
to
do
to
stop
swimming
there
was
no
mystery
in
that
if
he
could
do
it
could
he
and
he
could
not
he
knew
it
instantly
he
was
aware
instantly
of
an
opposition
in
his
members
unanimous
and
invincible
clinging
to
life
with
a
single
and
fixed
resolve
finger
by
finger
sinew
by
sinew
something
that
was
at
once
he
and
not
he
at
once
within
and
without
him
the
shutting
of
some
miniature
valve
in
his
brain
which
a
single
manly
thought
should
suffice
to
open
and
the
grasp
of
an
external
fate
ineluctable
as
gravity
to
any
man
there
may
come
at
times
a
consciousness
that
there
blows
through
all
the
articulations
of
his
body
the
wind
of
a
spirit
not
wholly
his
that
his
mind
rebels
that
another
girds
him
and
carries
him
whither
he
would
not
it
came
now
to
herrick
with
the
authority
of
a
revelation
there
was
no
escape
possible
the
open
door
was
closed
in
his
recreant
face
he
must
go
back
into
the
world
and
amongst
men
without
illusion
he
must
stagger
on
to
the
end
with
the
pack
of
his
responsibility
and
his
disgrace
until
a
cold
a
blow
a
merciful
chance
ball
or
the
more
merciful
hangman
should
dismiss
him
from
his
infamy
there
were
men
who
could
commit
suicide
there
were
men
who
could
not
and
he
was
one
who
could
not
for
perhaps
a
minute
there
raged
in
his
mind
the
coil
of
this
discovery
then
cheerless
certitude
followed
and
with
an
incredible
simplicity
of
submission
to
ascertained
fact
he
turned
round
and
struck
out
for
shore
there
was
a
courage
in
this
which
he
could
not
appreciate
the
ignobility
of
his
cowardice
wholly
occupying
him
a
strong
current
set
against
him
like
a
wind
in
his
face
he
contended
with
it
heavily
wearily
without
enthusiasm
but
with
substantial
advantage
marking
his
progress
the
while
without
pleasure
by
the
outline
of
the
trees
once
he
had
a
moment
of
hope
he
heard
to
the
southward
of
him
towards
the
centre
of
the
lagoon
the
wallowing
of
some
great
fish
doubtless
a
shark
and
paused
for
a
little
treading
water
might
not
this
be
the
hangman
he
thought
but
the
wallowing
died
away
mere
silence
succeeded
and
herrick
pushed
on
again
for
the
shore
raging
as
he
went
at
his
own
nature
ay
he
would
wait
for
the
shark
but
if
he
had
heard
him
coming
his
smile
was
tragic
he
could
have
spat
upon
himself
about
three
in
the
morning
chance
and
the
set
of
the
current
and
the
bias
of
his
own
body
so
decided
it
between
them
that
he
came
to
shore
upon
the
beach
in
front
of
attwater
there
he
sat
down
and
looked
forth
into
a
world
without
any
of
the
lights
of
hope
the
poor
diving
dress
of
was
sadly
tattered
with
the
fairy
tale
of
suicide
of
a
refuge
always
open
to
him
he
had
hitherto
beguiled
and
supported
himself
in
the
trials
of
life
and
behold
that
also
was
only
a
fairy
tale
that
also
was
with
the
consequences
of
his
acts
he
saw
himself
implacably
confronted
for
the
duration
of
life
stretched
upon
a
cross
and
nailed
there
with
the
iron
bolts
of
his
own
cowardice
he
had
no
tears
he
told
himself
no
stories
his
disgust
with
himself
was
so
complete
that
even
the
process
of
apologetic
mythology
had
ceased
he
was
like
a
man
cast
down
from
a
pillar
and
every
bone
broken
he
lay
there
and
admitted
the
facts
and
did
not
attempt
to
rise
dawn
began
to
break
over
the
far
side
of
the
atoll
the
sky
brightened
the
clouds
became
dyed
with
gorgeous
colours
the
shadows
of
the
night
lifted
and
suddenly
herrick
was
aware
that
the
lagoon
and
the
trees
wore
again
their
daylight
livery
and
he
saw
on
board
the
farallone
davis
extinguishing
the
lantern
and
smoke
rising
from
the
galley
davis
without
doubt
remarked
and
recognised
the
figure
on
the
beach
or
perhaps
hesitated
to
recognise
it
for
after
he
had
gazed
a
long
while
from
under
his
hand
he
went
into
the
house
and
fetched
a
glass
it
was
very
powerful
herrick
had
often
used
it
with
an
instinct
of
shame
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
what
brings
you
here
mr
or
mr
asked
the
voice
of
attwater
back
view
from
my
present
position
is
remarkably
fine
and
i
would
continue
to
present
it
we
can
get
on
very
nicely
as
we
are
and
if
you
were
to
turn
round
do
you
know
i
think
it
would
be
awkward
herrick
slowly
rose
to
his
feet
his
heart
throbbed
hard
a
hideous
excitement
shook
him
but
he
was
master
of
himself
slowly
he
turned
and
faced
attwater
and
the
muzzle
of
a
pointed
rifle
could
i
not
do
that
last
night
he
thought
why
do
you
fire
he
said
aloud
with
a
voice
that
trembled
attwater
slowly
put
his
gun
under
his
arm
then
his
hands
in
his
pockets
brings
you
here
he
repeated
do
know
said
herrick
and
then
with
a
cry
you
do
anything
with
me
you
armed
said
attwater
ask
for
the
form
sake
no
said
herrick
yes
i
am
too
and
he
flung
upon
the
beach
a
dripping
pistol
are
wet
said
attwater
i
am
wet
said
herrick
you
do
anything
with
me
attwater
read
his
face
attentively
would
depend
a
good
deal
upon
what
you
are
said
he
i
am
a
coward
said
herrick
is
very
little
to
be
done
with
that
said
attwater
yet
the
description
hardly
strikes
one
as
exhaustive
what
does
it
matter
cried
herrick
i
am
i
am
broken
crockery
i
am
a
burst
drum
the
whole
of
my
life
is
gone
to
water
i
have
nothing
left
that
i
believe
in
except
my
living
horror
of
myself
why
do
i
come
to
you
i
do
know
you
are
cold
cruel
hateful
and
i
hate
you
or
i
think
i
hate
you
but
you
are
an
honest
man
an
honest
gentleman
i
put
myself
helpless
in
your
hands
what
must
i
do
if
i
ca
do
anything
be
merciful
and
put
a
bullet
through
me
it
only
a
puppy
with
a
broken
leg
i
were
you
i
would
pick
up
that
pistol
come
up
to
the
house
and
put
on
some
dry
clothes
said
attwater
you
really
mean
it
said
herrick
know
they
we
they
but
you
know
all
know
quite
enough
said
attwater
up
to
the
house
and
the
captain
from
the
deck
of
the
farallone
saw
the
two
men
pass
together
under
the
shadow
of
the
grove
chapter
david
and
goliath
huish
had
bundled
himself
up
from
the
glare
of
the
day
his
face
to
the
house
his
knees
retracted
the
frail
bones
in
the
thin
tropical
raiment
seemed
scarce
more
considerable
than
a
fowl
and
davis
sitting
on
the
rail
with
his
arm
about
a
stay
contemplated
him
with
gloom
wondering
what
manner
of
counsel
that
insignificant
figure
should
contain
for
since
herrick
had
thrown
him
off
and
deserted
to
the
enemy
huish
alone
of
mankind
remained
to
him
to
be
a
helper
and
oracle
he
considered
their
position
with
a
sinking
heart
the
ship
was
a
stolen
ship
the
stores
either
from
initial
carelessness
or
ill
administration
during
the
voyage
were
insufficient
to
carry
them
to
any
port
except
back
to
papeete
and
there
retribution
waited
in
the
shape
of
a
gendarme
a
judge
with
a
hat
and
the
horror
of
distant
noumea
upon
that
side
there
was
no
glimmer
of
hope
here
at
the
island
the
dragon
was
roused
attwater
with
his
men
and
his
winchesters
watched
and
patrolled
the
house
let
him
who
dare
approach
it
what
else
was
then
left
but
to
sit
there
inactive
pacing
the
decks
until
the
trinity
hall
arrived
and
they
were
cast
into
irons
or
until
the
food
came
to
an
end
and
the
pangs
of
famine
succeeded
for
the
trinity
hall
davis
was
prepared
he
would
barricade
the
house
and
die
there
defending
it
like
a
rat
in
a
crevice
but
for
the
other
the
cruise
of
the
farallone
into
which
he
had
plunged
only
a
fortnight
before
with
such
golden
expectations
could
this
be
the
nightmare
end
of
it
the
ship
rotting
at
anchor
the
crew
stumbling
and
dying
in
the
scuppers
it
seemed
as
if
any
extreme
of
hazard
were
to
be
preferred
to
so
grisly
a
certainty
as
if
it
would
be
better
to
after
all
put
to
sea
at
a
venture
and
perhaps
perish
at
the
hands
of
cannibals
on
one
of
the
more
obscure
paumotus
his
eye
roved
swiftly
over
sea
and
sky
in
quest
of
any
promise
of
wind
but
the
fountains
of
the
trade
were
empty
where
it
had
run
yesterday
and
for
weeks
before
a
roaring
blue
river
charioting
clouds
silence
now
reigned
and
the
whole
height
of
the
atmosphere
stood
balanced
on
the
endless
ribbon
of
island
that
stretched
out
to
either
hand
of
him
its
array
of
golden
and
green
and
silvery
palms
not
the
most
volatile
frond
was
to
be
seen
stirring
they
drooped
to
their
stable
images
in
the
lagoon
like
things
carved
of
metal
and
already
their
long
line
began
to
reverberate
heat
there
was
no
escape
possible
that
day
none
probable
on
the
morrow
and
still
the
stores
were
running
out
then
came
over
davis
from
deep
down
in
the
roots
of
his
being
or
at
least
from
far
back
among
his
memories
of
childhood
and
innocence
a
wave
of
superstition
this
run
of
ill
luck
was
something
beyond
natural
the
chances
of
the
game
were
in
themselves
more
various
it
seemed
as
if
the
devil
must
serve
the
pieces
the
devil
he
heard
again
the
clear
note
of
attwater
bell
ringing
abroad
into
the
night
and
dying
away
how
if
god
briskly
he
averted
his
mind
attwater
that
was
the
point
attwater
had
food
and
a
treasure
of
pearls
escape
made
possible
in
the
present
riches
in
the
future
they
must
come
to
grips
with
attwater
the
man
must
die
a
smoky
heat
went
over
his
face
as
he
recalled
the
impotent
figure
he
had
made
last
night
and
the
contemptuous
speeches
he
must
bear
in
silence
rage
shame
and
the
love
of
life
all
pointed
the
one
way
and
only
invention
halted
how
to
reach
him
had
he
strength
enough
was
there
any
help
in
that
misbegotten
packet
of
bones
against
the
house
his
eyes
dwelled
upon
him
with
a
strange
avidity
as
though
he
would
read
into
his
soul
and
presently
the
sleeper
moved
stirred
uneasily
turned
suddenly
round
and
threw
him
a
blinking
look
davis
maintained
the
same
dark
stare
and
huish
looked
away
again
and
sat
up
i
an
on
me
said
he
believe
i
was
a
bit
swipey
last
night
that
said
the
captain
cried
huish
i
say
i
gone
too
you
said
the
captain
i
would
replied
huish
like
attwater
all
right
we
got
on
like
one
when
you
were
gone
and
ai
his
sherry
in
it
rather
it
like
spiers
and
ponds
amontillado
i
wish
i
a
drain
of
it
now
he
sighed
you
never
get
no
more
of
it
that
one
thing
said
davis
gravely
wot
wrong
with
you
dyvis
coppers
well
look
at
me
i
ai
grumpy
said
huish
as
plyful
as
a
i
am
said
davis
playful
i
own
that
and
you
were
playful
last
night
i
believe
and
a
damned
fine
performance
you
made
of
it
said
huish
this
wot
performance
i
tell
you
said
the
captain
getting
slowly
off
the
rail
and
he
did
at
full
length
with
every
wounding
epithet
and
absurd
detail
repeated
and
emphasised
he
had
his
own
vanity
and
huish
upon
the
grill
and
roasted
them
and
as
he
spoke
he
inflicted
and
endured
agonies
of
humiliation
it
was
a
plain
man
masterpiece
of
the
sardonic
do
you
think
of
it
said
he
when
he
had
done
and
looked
down
at
huish
flushed
and
serious
and
yet
jeering
tell
you
wot
it
is
was
the
reply
and
me
cut
a
pretty
dicky
figure
so
said
davis
pretty
measly
figure
by
god
and
by
god
i
want
to
see
that
man
at
my
knees
said
huish
to
get
him
there
it
cried
davis
to
get
hold
of
him
they
four
to
two
though
there
only
one
man
among
them
to
count
and
that
attwater
get
a
bead
on
attwater
and
the
others
would
cut
and
run
and
sing
out
like
frightened
poultry
and
old
man
herrick
would
come
round
with
his
hat
for
a
share
of
the
pearls
no
sir
it
how
to
get
hold
of
attwater
and
we
dare
even
go
ashore
he
would
shoot
us
in
the
boat
like
dogs
you
particular
about
having
him
dead
or
alive
asked
huish
want
to
see
him
dead
said
the
captain
well
said
huish
i
believe
i
do
a
bit
of
breakfast
and
he
turned
into
the
house
the
captain
doggedly
followed
him
this
he
asked
your
idea
anyway
you
let
me
alone
will
you
said
huish
opening
a
bottle
of
champagne
my
idea
soon
enough
wyte
till
i
pour
some
chain
on
my
coppers
he
drank
a
glass
off
and
affected
to
listen
said
he
it
fizz
like
fryin
i
declyre
a
glass
do
and
look
sociable
said
the
captain
with
emphasis
i
will
not
business
your
money
and
you
tykes
your
choice
my
little
man
returned
huish
rather
a
shyme
to
me
to
spoil
your
breakfast
for
really
ancient
he
finished
three
parts
of
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
nibbled
a
corner
of
biscuit
with
extreme
deliberation
the
captain
sitting
opposite
and
champing
the
bit
like
an
impatient
horse
then
huish
leaned
his
arms
on
the
table
and
looked
davis
in
the
face
you
ready
said
he
now
what
your
idea
said
davis
with
a
sigh
play
said
huish
yours
trouble
is
that
i
got
none
replied
davis
and
wandered
for
some
time
in
aimless
discussion
of
the
difficulties
in
their
path
and
useless
explanations
of
his
own
fiasco
done
said
huish
dry
up
right
here
replied
davis
then
said
huish
give
me
your
across
the
table
and
say
gawd
strike
me
dead
if
i
do
back
you
his
voice
was
hardly
raised
yet
it
thrilled
the
hearer
his
face
seemed
the
epitome
of
cunning
and
the
captain
recoiled
from
it
as
from
a
blow
for
said
he
said
huish
guarantee
demanded
and
he
continued
to
hold
out
his
hand
do
see
the
good
of
any
such
tomfoolery
said
the
other
do
though
returned
huish
gim
me
your
and
say
the
words
then
you
my
view
of
it
do
and
you
wo
the
captain
went
through
the
required
form
breathing
short
and
gazing
on
the
clerk
with
anguish
what
to
fear
he
knew
not
yet
he
feared
slavishly
what
was
to
fall
from
the
pale
lips
if
you
excuse
me
a
second
said
huish
go
and
fetch
the
byby
baby
said
davis
that
with
care
this
side
up
replied
the
clerk
with
a
wink
as
he
disappeared
he
returned
smiling
to
himself
and
carrying
in
his
hand
a
silk
handkerchief
the
long
stupid
wrinkles
ran
up
davis
brow
as
he
saw
it
what
should
it
contain
he
could
think
of
nothing
more
recondite
than
a
revolver
huish
resumed
his
seat
said
he
you
man
enough
to
take
charge
of
and
the
niggers
because
i
take
care
of
hattwater
cried
davis
ca

clerk

a
one
but
about

bloomin
boat

davis

bearer
mr
is
empowered
to
represent
you
armed
with
simple
expedient
mr
will
proceed
to
business
he
paused
like
one
who
had
finished
but
still
held
davis
with
his
eye
said
davis
you
see
you
big
returned
huish
knows
you

gun
in
your
pocket

anybody

eye

up

he
resumed
look

and
back
me
up
smart
if

do

go
again
and
nothink

the
captain
face

by
the
frenzied
effort
to
comprehend

he
cried
ca

venomous
triumph

the
captain
almost
in
a
whisper

davis
rose
and
took
a
turn
in
the
house
i
want

said
at
last
with
an
effort
you
back
at
the
wall

do
the
best
you

do
you
began
the
clerk
that
because
i
to
know
there
a
prejudice
against
it
it
considered
vulgar
vulgar
he
unrolled
the
handkerchief
and
showed
a
jar
vitriol
this
is
said
he
the
captain
stared
upon
him
with
a
whitening
face
is
the
stuff
he
pursued
holding
it
up
burn
to
the
bone
you
see
it

upon
like

bloomin
heyesight

huish

medicine

a
bottle

up

fuss

that
so
said
davis
do
seem
someways
reasonable
only
there
it
is
the
happlication
of
science

know
what
it
is
cried
davis
pacing
the
floor
there
i
draw
the
line
at
it
i
ca
put
a
finger
to
no
such
piggishness
too
damned
hateful

bit
o
lead
and

said
davis
something
here
inside
of
me
it
foolishness
i
dare
say
it
dam
foolishness
i
do
argue
i
just
draw
the
line
is
there
no
other
way
for
yourself
said
huish
ai
wedded
to
this
if
you
think
i
am
i
ai
ambitious
i
do
make
a
point
of
playin
the
lead
i
offer
to
that
all
and
if
you

me
better
by
gawd
i
goin
to
the
risk
cried
davis
you
ast
me
straight
i
should
say
it
was
a
case
of
seven
to
one
and
no
takers
said
huish
that
my
ducky
and
i
gyme
that
wot
i
am
gyme
all
through
the
captain
looked
at
him
huish
sat
there
preening
his
sinister
vanity
glorying
in
his
precedency
in
evil
and
the
villainous
courage
and
readiness
of
the
creature
shone
out
of
him
like
a
candle
from
a
lantern
dismay
and
a
kind
of
respect
seized
hold
on
davis
in
his
own
despite
until
that
moment
he
had
seen
the
clerk
always
hanging
back
always
listless
uninterested
and
openly
grumbling
at
a
word
of
anything
to
do
and
now
by
the
touch
of
an
enchanter
wand
he
beheld
him
sitting
girt
and
resolved
and
his
face
radiant
he
had
raised
the
devil
he
thought
and
asked
who
was
to
control
him
and
his
spirits
quailed
as
long
as
you
like
huish
was
going
on
do
see
any
green
in
my
eye
i
ai
afryde
of
attwater
i
ai
afryde
of
you
and
i
ai
afryde
of
words
you
want
to
kill
people
that
wot
you
want
but
you
want
to
do
it
in
kid
gloves
and
it
ca
be
done
that
murder
ai
genteel
it
ai
easy
it
ai
safe
and
it
tykes
a
man
to
do
it
the
man
began
the
captain
with
energy
and
then
stopped
and
remained
staring
at
him
with
corrugated
brows
hout
with
it
said
huish
you
anythink
else
to
put
up
is
there
any
other
chanst
to
try
the
captain
held
his
peace
you
are
then
said
huish
with
a
shrug
davis
fell
again
to
his
pacing
you
may
do
till
you
blue
in
the
mug
you
wo
find
anythink
else
said
huish
there
was
a
little
silence
the
captain
like
a
man
launched
on
a
swing
flying
dizzily
among
extremes
of
conjecture
and
refusal
see
he
said
suddenly
pausing
you
can
the
thing
be
done
it
it
ca
be
easy
i
get
within
twenty
foot
of
it
be
done
so
you
look
out
said
huish
and
his
tone
of
certainty
was
absolute
can
you
know
that
broke
from
the
captain
in
a
choked
cry
beast
i
believe
you
done
it
before
that
private
affyres
returned
huish
ai
a
talking
man
a
shock
of
repulsion
struck
and
shook
the
captain
a
scream
rose
almost
to
his
lips
had
he
uttered
it
he
might
have
cast
himself
at
the
same
moment
on
the
body
of
huish
might
have
picked
him
up
and
flung
him
down
and
wiped
the
cabin
with
him
in
a
frenzy
of
cruelty
that
seemed
half
moral
but
the
moment
passed
and
the
abortive
crisis
left
the
man
weaker
the
stakes
were
so
high
the
pearls
on
the
one
hand
starvation
and
shame
on
the
other
ten
years
of
pearls
the
imagination
of
davis
translated
them
into
a
new
glorified
existence
for
himself
and
his
family
the
seat
of
this
new
life
must
be
in
london
there
were
deadly
reasons
against
portland
maine
and
the
pictures
that
came
to
him
were
of
english
manners
he
saw
his
boys
marching
in
the
procession
of
a
school
with
gowns
on
an
usher
marshalling
them
and
reading
as
he
walked
in
a
great
book
he
was
installed
in
a
villa
the
name
rosemore
on
the
gateposts
in
a
chair
on
the
gravel
walk
he
seemed
to
sit
smoking
a
cigar
a
blue
ribbon
in
his
buttonhole
victor
over
himself
and
circumstances
and
the
malignity
of
bankers
he
saw
the
parlour
with
red
curtains
and
shells
on
the
mantelpiece
and
with
the
fine
inconsistency
of
visions
mixed
a
grog
at
the
mahogany
table
ere
he
turned
in
with
that
the
farallone
gave
one
of
the
aimless
and
nameless
movements
which
even
in
an
anchored
ship
and
even
in
the
most
profound
calm
remind
one
of
the
mobility
of
fluids
and
he
was
back
again
under
the
cover
of
the
house
the
fierce
daylight
besieging
it
all
round
and
glaring
in
the
chinks
and
the
clerk
in
a
rather
airy
attitude
awaiting
his
decision
he
began
to
walk
again
he
aspired
after
the
realisation
of
these
dreams
like
a
horse
nickering
for
water
the
lust
of
them
burned
in
his
inside
and
the
only
obstacle
was
attwater
who
had
insulted
him
from
the
first
he
gave
herrick
a
full
share
of
the
pearls
he
insisted
on
it
huish
opposed
him
and
he
trod
the
opposition
down
and
praised
himself
exceedingly
he
was
not
going
to
use
vitriol
himself
was
he
huish
keeper
it
was
a
pity
he
had
asked
but
after
all
he
saw
the
boys
again
in
the
school
procession
with
the
gowns
he
had
thought
to
be
so
long
since
and
at
the
same
time
the
incomparable
shame
of
the
last
evening
blazed
up
in
his
mind
it
your
own
way
he
said
hoarsely
i
knew
you
would
walk
up
said
huish
for
the
letter
paper
pens
and
ink
sit
down
and
i
dictyte
the
captain
took
a
seat
and
the
pen
looked
a
while
helplessly
at
the
paper
then
at
huish
the
swing
had
gone
the
other
way
there
was
a
blur
upon
his
eyes
a
dreadful
business
he
said
with
a
strong
twitch
of
his
shoulders
rather
a
start
no
doubt
said
huish
a
dip
of
ink
it
william
john
hattwater
sir
he
dictated
do
you
know
his
name
is
william
john
asked
davis
it
on
a
packing
case
said
huish
that
said
davis
there
another
thing
what
are
we
to
write
my
golly
cried
the
exasperated
huish
kind
of
man
do
you
call
yourself
i
goin
to
tell
you
wot
to
write
that
my
pitch
if
just
be
so
bloomin
condescendin
as
to
write
it
down
william
john
attwater
sir
he
reiterated
and
the
captain
at
last
beginning
half
mechanically
to
move
his
pen
the
dictation
proceeded
it
is
with
feelings
of
shyme
and
contrition
that
i
approach
you
after
the
yumiliatin
events
of
last
night
our
mr
has
left
the
ship
and
will
have
doubtless
communicated
to
you
the
nature
of
our
needless
to
these
are
no
longer
possible
fate
declyred
against
us
and
we
bow
the
well
awyre
as
i
am
of
the
just
suspicions
with
i
am
regarded
i
do
not
venture
to
solicit
the
fyvour
of
an
interview
for
myself
but
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
a
situytion
must
be
equally
pyneful
to
all
i
deputed
my
friend
and
partner
mr
huish
to
before
you
my
proposals
and
by
their
moderytion
will
i
trust
be
found
to
merit
your
attention
mr
huish
is
entirely
unarmed
i
swear
to
gawd
and
will
over
from
the
moment
he
begins
to
approach
you
i
am
your
fytheful
servant
john
davis
huish
read
the
letter
with
the
innocent
joy
of
amateurs
chuckled
gustfully
to
himself
and
reopened
it
more
than
once
after
it
was
folded
to
repeat
the
pleasure
davis
meanwhile
sitting
inert
and
heavily
frowning
of
a
sudden
he
rose
he
seemed
all
abroad
he
cried
it
be
it
too
much
it
damnation
god
would
never
forgive
it
and
wants
him
to
returned
huish
shrill
with
fury
were
damned
years
ago
for
the
sea
rynger
and
said
so
yourself
well
then
be
damned
for
something
else
and
your
tongue
the
captain
looked
at
him
mistily
he
pleaded
old
man
do
it
now
said
huish
give
you
my
ultimytum
go
or
you
are
i
do
mind
i
goin
to
see
that
man
and
chuck
this
vitriol
in
his
eyes
if
you
i
go
alone
the
niggers
will
likely
knock
me
on
the
and
a
fat
lot
you
be
the
better
but
there
one
thing
sure
i
no
more
of
your
moonin
mullygrubbin
rot
and
tyke
it
stryte
the
captain
took
it
with
a
blink
and
a
gulp
memory
with
phantom
voices
repeated
in
his
cars
something
similar
something
he
had
once
said
to
herrick
years
ago
it
seemed
gim
me
over
your
pistol
said
huish
to
see
all
clear
six
shots
and
mind
you
do
wyste
them
the
captain
like
a
man
in
a
nightmare
laid
down
his
revolver
on
the
table
and
huish
wiped
the
cartridges
and
oiled
the
works
it
was
close
on
noon
there
was
no
breath
of
wind
and
the
heat
was
scarce
bearable
when
the
two
men
came
on
deck
had
the
boat
manned
and
passed
down
one
after
another
into
the
a
white
shirt
at
the
end
of
an
oar
served
as
a
flag
of
truce
and
the
men
by
direction
and
to
give
it
the
better
chance
to
be
observed
pulled
with
extreme
slowness
the
isle
shook
before
them
like
a
place
incandescent
on
the
face
of
the
lagoon
blinding
copper
suns
no
bigger
than
sixpences
danced
and
stabbed
them
in
the
eyeballs
there
went
up
from
sand
and
sea
and
even
from
the
boat
a
glare
of
scathing
brightness
and
as
they
could
only
peer
abroad
from
between
closed
lashes
the
excess
of
light
seemed
to
be
changed
into
a
sinister
darkness
comparable
to
that
of
a
thundercloud
before
it
bursts
the
captain
had
come
upon
this
errand
for
any
one
of
a
dozen
reasons
the
last
of
which
was
desire
for
its
success
superstition
rules
all
men
and
gross
natures
like
that
of
davis
it
rules
utterly
for
murder
he
had
been
prepared
but
this
horror
of
the
medicine
in
the
bottle
went
beyond
him
and
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
parting
the
last
strands
that
united
him
to
god
the
boat
carried
him
on
to
reprobation
to
damnation
and
he
suffered
himself
to
be
carried
passively
consenting
silently
bidding
farewell
to
his
better
self
and
his
hopes
huish
sat
by
his
side
in
towering
spirits
that
were
not
wholly
genuine
perhaps
as
brave
a
man
as
ever
lived
brave
as
a
weasel
he
must
still
reassure
himself
with
the
tones
of
his
own
voice
he
must
play
his
part
to
exaggeration
he
must
herod
insult
all
that
was
respectable
and
brave
all
that
was
formidable
in
a
kind
of
desperate
wager
with
himself
but
it
said
he
i
call
it
nice
to
get
your
gruel
in
i
you
know
it
must
feel
peculiar
to
get
bowled
over
on
a
like
this
i
rather
it
on
a
cowld
and
frosty
morning
would
you
singing
we
go
round
the
mulberry
bush
on
a
cowld
and
frosty
spoken
give
you
my
word
i
thought
o
that
in
ten
year
used
to
sing
it
at
a
hinfant
school
in
wick
it
was
singing
this
is
the
way
the
tyler
does
the
tyler
spoken
bloomin
are
you
off
now
for
the
notion
of
a
future
styte
do
you
cotton
to
the
views
or
the
old
red
boguey
business
dry
up
said
the
captain
but
i
want
to
know
said
huish
within
the
of
practical
politics
for
you
and
me
my
boy
we
may
both
be
bowled
over
one
up
down
within
the
next
ten
minutes
it
would
be
rather
a
lark
now
if
you
only
skipped
across
came
up
smilin
side
and
a
hangel
met
you
with
a
and
under
his
wing
you
come
i
tyke
this
kind
the
captain
groaned
while
huish
was
thus
airing
and
exercising
his
bravado
the
man
at
his
side
was
actually
engaged
in
prayer
prayer
what
for
god
knows
but
out
of
his
inconsistent
illogical
and
agitated
spirit
a
stream
of
supplication
was
poured
forth
inarticulate
as
himself
earnest
as
death
and
judgment
gawd
seest
me
continued
huish
remember
i
had
that
written
in
my
bible
i
remember
the
bible
too
all
about
abinadab
and
parties
well
gawd
apostrophising
the
meridian
goin
to
see
a
rum
start
presently
i
promise
you
that
the
captain
bounded
have
no
blasphemy
he
cried
blasphemy
in
my
boat
right
cap
said
huish
to
oblige
any
other
topic
you
would
like
to
sudgest
the
rynegyge
the
lightnin
rod
shykespeare
or
the
musical
glasses
conversation
on
a
tap
put
a
penny
in
the
slot
and
they
are
he
cried
or
never
is
to
shoot
and
the
little
man
straightened
himself
into
an
alert
and
dashing
attitude
and
looked
steadily
at
the
enemy
but
the
captain
rose
half
up
in
the
boat
with
eyes
protruding
that
he
cried
wot
said
huish
blamed
things
said
the
captain
and
indeed
it
was
something
strange
herrick
and
attwater
both
armed
with
winchesters
had
appeared
out
of
the
grove
behind
the
and
to
either
hand
of
them
the
sun
glistened
upon
two
metallic
objects
locomotory
like
men
and
occupying
in
the
economy
of
these
creatures
the
places
of
heads
only
the
heads
were
faceless
to
davis
between
wind
and
water
his
mythology
appeared
to
have
come
alive
and
tophet
to
be
vomiting
demons
but
huish
was
not
mystified
a
moment
you
ninny
ca
you
see
he
said
they
are
said
davis
with
a
gasp
why
oh
i
see
it
for
armour
did
i
tell
you
said
huish
and
goliar
all
the
and
back
the
two
natives
for
they
it
was
that
were
equipped
in
this
unusual
panoply
of
war
spread
out
to
right
and
left
and
at
last
lay
down
in
the
shade
on
the
extreme
flank
of
the
position
even
now
that
the
mystery
was
explained
davis
was
hatefully
preoccupied
stared
at
the
flame
on
their
crests
and
forgot
and
then
remembered
with
a
smile
the
explanation
attwater
withdrew
again
into
the
grove
and
herrick
with
his
gun
under
his
arm
came
down
the
pier
alone
about
down
he
halted
and
hailed
the
boat
do
you
want
he
cried
tell
that
to
mr
attwater
replied
huish
stepping
briskly
on
the
ladder
do
tell
it
to
you
because
you
played
the
trucklin
sneak
here
a
letter
for
him
tyke
it
and
give
it
and
be
to
you
is
this
all
right
said
herrick
davis
raised
his
chin
glanced
swiftly
at
herrick
and
away
again
and
held
his
peace
the
glance
was
charged
with
some
deep
emotion
but
whether
of
hatred
or
of
fear
it
was
beyond
herrick
to
divine
he
said
give
the
letter
he
drew
a
score
with
his
foot
on
the
boards
of
the
gangway
i
bring
the
answer
do
move
a
step
past
this
and
he
returned
to
where
attwater
leaned
against
a
tree
and
gave
him
the
letter
attwater
glanced
it
through
does
that
mean
he
asked
passing
it
to
herrick
i
suppose
so
said
herrick
tell
him
to
come
on
said
attwater
is
a
fatalist
for
nothing
tell
him
to
come
on
and
to
look
out
herrick
returned
to
the
down
the
pier
the
clerk
was
waiting
with
davis
by
his
side
are
to
come
along
huish
said
herrick
bids
you
look
out
no
tricks
huish
walked
briskly
up
the
pier
and
paused
face
to
face
with
the
young
man
is
said
he
and
to
herrick
surprise
the
insignificant
face
before
him
flushed
suddenly
crimson
and
went
white
again
forward
said
herrick
pointing
your
hands
above
your
head
the
clerk
turned
away
from
him
and
towards
the
as
though
he
were
about
to
address
to
it
his
devotions
he
was
seen
to
heave
a
deep
breath
and
raised
his
arms
in
common
with
many
men
of
his
unhappy
physical
endowments
huish
hands
were
disproportionately
long
and
broad
and
the
palms
in
particular
enormous
a
jar
was
nothing
in
that
capacious
fist
the
next
moment
he
was
plodding
steadily
forward
on
his
mission
herrick
at
first
followed
then
a
noise
in
his
rear
startled
him
and
he
turned
about
to
find
davis
already
advanced
as
far
as
the
he
came
crouching
and
as
the
mesmerised
may
follow
the
mesmeriser
all
human
considerations
and
even
the
care
of
his
own
life
swallowed
up
in
one
abominable
and
burning
curiosity
cried
herrick
covering
him
with
his
rifle
what
are
you
doing
man
you
are
not
to
come
davis
instinctively
paused
and
regarded
him
with
a
dreadful
vacancy
of
eye
your
back
to
that
do
you
hear
me
and
stand
fast
said
herrick
the
captain
fetched
a
breath
stepped
back
against
the
and
instantly
redirected
his
glances
after
huish
there
was
a
hollow
place
of
the
sand
in
that
part
and
as
it
were
a
glade
among
the
cocoa
palms
in
which
the
direct
noonday
sun
blazed
intolerably
at
the
far
end
in
the
shadow
the
tall
figure
of
attwater
was
to
be
seen
leaning
on
a
tree
towards
him
with
his
hands
over
his
head
and
his
steps
smothered
in
the
sand
the
clerk
painfully
waded
the
surrounding
glare
threw
out
and
exaggerated
the
man
smallness
it
seemed
no
less
perilous
an
enterprise
this
that
he
was
gone
upon
than
for
a
whelp
to
besiege
a
citadel
mr
whish
that
will
do
cried
attwater
that
distance
and
keeping
your
hands
up
like
a
good
boy
you
can
very
well
put
me
in
possession
of
the
skipper
views
the
interval
betwixt
them
was
perhaps
forty
feet
and
huish
measured
it
with
his
eye
and
breathed
a
curse
he
was
already
distressed
with
labouring
in
the
loose
sand
and
his
arms
ached
bitterly
from
their
unnatural
position
in
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
the
jar
was
ready
and
his
heart
thrilled
and
his
voice
choked
as
he
began
to
speak
hattwater
said
he
do
know
if
ever
you
a
mother
can
set
your
mind
at
rest
i
had
returned
attwater
henceforth
if
i
might
venture
to
suggest
it
her
name
need
not
recur
in
our
communications
i
should
perhaps
tell
you
that
i
am
not
amenable
to
the
pathetic
am
sorry
sir
if
i
seemed
to
tresparse
on
your
private
feelin
said
the
clerk
cringing
and
stealing
a
step
least
sir
you
will
never
me
that
you
are
not
a
perfec
gentleman
i
know
a
gentleman
when
i
see
him
and
as
such
i
no
in
throwin
myself
on
your
merciful
consideration
it
is
lines
no
doubt
it
lines
to
have
to
hown
yourself
beat
it
lines
to
to
come
and
beg
to
you
for
charity
if
things
had
only
gone
right
the
whole
place
was
as
good
as
your
own
suggested
attwater
can
understand
the
feeling
are
judging
me
mr
attwater
said
the
clerk
god
knows
how
unjustly
thou
gawd
seest
me
was
the
tex
i
in
my
bible
my
father
wrote
it
in
with
own
upon
the
fly
leaft
am
sorry
i
have
to
beg
your
pardon
once
more
said
attwater
do
you
know
you
seem
to
me
to
be
a
trifle
nearer
which
is
entirely
outside
of
our
bargain
and
i
would
venture
to
suggest
that
you
take
one
two
three
steps
back
and
stay
there
the
devil
at
this
staggering
disappointment
looked
out
of
face
and
attwater
was
swift
to
suspect
he
frowned
he
stared
on
the
little
man
and
considered
why
should
he
be
creeping
nearer
the
next
moment
his
gun
was
at
his
shoulder
oblige
me
by
opening
your
hands
open
your
hands
wide
let
me
see
the
fingers
spread
you
dog
throw
down
that
thing
you
holding
he
roared
his
rage
and
certitude
increasing
together
and
then
at
almost
the
same
moment
the
indomitable
huish
decided
to
throw
and
attwater
pulled
the
trigger
there
was
scarce
the
difference
of
a
second
between
the
two
resolves
but
it
was
in
favour
of
the
man
with
the
rifle
and
the
jar
had
not
yet
left
the
clerk
hand
before
the
ball
shattered
both
for
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
wretch
was
in
hell
agonies
bathed
in
liquid
flames
a
screaming
bedlamite
and
then
a
second
and
more
merciful
bullet
stretched
him
dead
the
whole
thing
was
come
and
gone
in
a
breath
before
herrick
could
turn
about
before
davis
could
complete
his
cry
of
horror
the
clerk
lay
in
the
sand
sprawling
and
convulsed
attwater
ran
to
the
body
he
stooped
and
viewed
it
he
put
his
finger
in
the
vitriol
and
his
face
whitened
and
hardened
with
anger
davis
had
not
yet
moved
he
stood
astonished
with
his
back
to
the
his
hands
clutching
it
behind
him
his
body
inclined
forward
from
the
waist
attwater
turned
deliberately
and
covered
him
with
his
rifle
he
cried
in
a
voice
like
a
trumpet
give
you
sixty
seconds
to
make
your
peace
with
god
davis
looked
and
his
mind
awoke
he
did
not
dream
of
he
did
not
reach
for
his
pistol
he
drew
himself
up
instead
to
face
death
with
a
quivering
nostril
guess
i
not
trouble
the
old
man
he
said
the
job
i
was
on
i
guess
it
better
business
to
just
shut
my
face
attwater
fired
there
came
a
spasmodic
movement
of
the
victim
and
immediately
above
the
middle
of
his
forehead
a
black
hole
marred
the
whiteness
of
the
a
dreadful
pause
then
again
the
report
and
the
solid
sound
and
jar
of
the
bullet
in
the
wood
and
this
time
the
captain
had
felt
the
wind
of
it
along
his
cheek
a
third
shot
and
he
was
bleeding
from
one
ear
and
along
the
levelled
rifle
attwater
smiled
like
a
red
indian
the
cruel
game
of
which
he
was
the
puppet
was
now
clear
to
davis
three
times
he
had
drunk
of
death
and
he
must
look
to
drink
of
it
seven
times
more
before
he
was
despatched
he
held
up
his
hand
he
cried
take
your
sixty
seconds
said
attwater
the
captain
shut
his
eyes
tight
like
a
child
he
held
his
hands
up
at
last
with
a
tragic
and
ridiculous
gesture
god
for
christ
sake
look
after
my
two
kids
he
said
and
then
after
a
pause
and
a
falter
christ
sake
amen
and
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
down
the
rifle
with
a
quivering
mouth
do
keep
fooling
me
long
he
pleaded
all
your
prayer
asked
attwater
with
a
singular
ring
in
his
voice
so
said
davis
so
said
attwater
resting
the
butt
of
his
rifle
on
the
ground
that
done
is
your
peace
made
with
heaven
because
it
is
with
me
go
and
sin
no
more
sinful
father
and
remember
that
whatever
you
do
to
others
god
shall
visit
it
again
a
upon
your
innocents
the
wretched
davis
came
staggering
forward
from
his
place
against
the
fell
upon
his
knees
and
waved
his
hands
and
fainted
when
he
came
to
himself
again
his
head
was
on
attwater
arm
and
close
by
stood
one
of
the
men
in
divers
helmets
holding
a
bucket
of
water
from
which
his
late
executioner
now
laved
his
face
the
memory
of
that
dreadful
passage
returned
upon
him
in
a
clap
again
he
saw
huish
lying
dead
again
he
seemed
to
himself
to
totter
on
the
brink
of
an
unplumbed
eternity
with
trembling
hands
he
seized
hold
of
the
man
whom
he
had
come
to
slay
and
his
voice
broke
from
him
like
that
of
a
child
among
the
nightmares
of
fever
is
there
no
mercy
o
what
must
i
do
to
be
saved
thought
attwater
the
true
penitent
chapter
on
a
very
bright
hot
lusty
strongly
blowing
noon
a
fortnight
after
the
events
recorded
and
a
month
since
the
curtain
rose
upon
this
episode
a
man
might
have
been
spied
praying
on
the
sand
by
the
lagoon
beach
a
point
of
palm
trees
isolated
him
from
the
settlement
and
from
the
place
where
he
knelt
the
only
work
of
man
hand
that
interrupted
the
expanse
was
the
schooner
farallone
her
berth
quite
changed
and
rocking
at
anchor
some
two
miles
to
windward
in
the
midst
of
the
lagoon
the
noise
of
the
trade
ran
very
boisterous
in
all
parts
of
the
island
the
nearer
palm
trees
crashed
and
whistled
in
the
gusts
those
farther
off
contributed
a
humming
bass
like
the
roar
of
cities
and
yet
to
any
man
less
absorbed
there
must
have
risen
at
times
over
this
turmoil
of
the
winds
the
sharper
note
of
the
human
voice
from
the
settlement
there
all
was
activity
attwater
stripped
to
his
trousers
and
lending
a
strong
hand
of
help
was
directing
and
encouraging
five
kanakas
from
his
lively
voice
and
their
more
lively
efforts
it
was
to
be
gathered
that
some
sudden
and
joyful
emergency
had
set
them
in
this
bustle
and
the
union
jack
floated
once
more
on
its
staff
but
the
suppliant
on
the
beach
unconscious
of
their
voices
prayed
on
with
instancy
and
fervour
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
rose
and
fell
again
and
his
countenance
brightened
and
was
deformed
with
changing
moods
of
piety
and
terror
before
his
closed
eyes
the
skiff
had
been
for
some
time
tacking
towards
the
distant
and
deserted
farallone
and
presently
the
figure
of
herrick
might
have
been
observed
to
board
her
to
pass
for
a
while
into
the
house
thence
forward
to
the
forecastle
and
at
last
to
plunge
into
the
main
hatch
in
all
these
quarters
his
visit
was
followed
by
a
coil
of
smoke
and
he
had
scarce
entered
his
boat
again
and
shoved
off
before
flames
broke
forth
upon
the
schooner
they
burned
gaily
kerosene
had
not
been
spared
and
the
bellows
of
the
trade
incited
the
conflagration
about
half
way
on
the
return
voyage
when
herrick
looked
back
he
beheld
the
farallone
wrapped
to
the
topmasts
in
leaping
arms
of
fire
and
the
voluminous
smoke
pursuing
him
along
the
face
of
the
lagoon
in
one
hour
time
he
computed
the
waters
would
have
closed
over
the
stolen
ship
it
so
chanced
that
as
his
boat
flew
before
the
wind
with
much
vivacity
and
his
eyes
were
continually
busy
in
the
wake
measuring
the
progress
of
the
flames
he
found
himself
embayed
to
the
northward
of
the
point
of
palms
and
here
became
aware
at
the
same
time
of
the
figure
of
davis
immersed
in
his
devotion
an
exclamation
part
of
annoyance
part
of
amusement
broke
from
him
and
he
touched
the
helm
and
ran
the
prow
upon
the
beach
not
twenty
feet
from
the
unconscious
devotee
taking
the
painter
in
his
hand
he
landed
and
drew
near
and
stood
over
him
and
still
the
voluble
and
incoherent
stream
of
prayer
continued
unabated
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
overhear
the
suppliant
petitions
which
he
listened
to
some
while
in
a
very
mingled
mood
of
humour
and
pity
and
it
was
only
when
his
own
name
began
to
occur
and
to
be
conjoined
with
epithets
that
he
at
last
laid
his
hand
on
the
captain
shoulder
to
interrupt
the
exercise
said
he
i
want
you
to
look
at
the
farallone
the
captain
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
stood
gasping
and
staring
herrick
do
startle
a
man
like
that
he
said
do
seem
someways
rightly
myself
since
he
broke
off
did
you
say
anyway
o
the
farallone
and
he
looked
languidly
out
said
herrick
she
burns
and
you
may
guess
from
that
what
the
news
is
trinity
hall
i
guess
said
the
captain
same
said
herrick
half
an
hour
ago
and
coming
up
hand
over
fist
it
do
amount
to
a
hill
of
beans
said
the
captain
with
a
sigh
come
that
rank
ingratitude
cried
herrick
replied
the
captain
meditatively
may
just
see
the
way
that
i
view
it
in
but
i
rather
stay
here
upon
this
island
i
found
peace
here
peace
in
believing
yes
i
guess
this
island
is
about
good
enough
for
john
davis
never
heard
such
nonsense
cried
herrick
with
all
turning
out
in
your
favour
the
way
it
does
the
farallone
wiped
out
the
crew
disposed
of
a
sure
thing
for
your
wife
and
family
and
you
yourself
attwater
spoiled
darling
and
pet
penitent
mr
herrick
do
say
that
said
the
captain
gently
you
know
he
do
make
no
difference
between
us
but
o
why
not
be
one
of
us
why
not
come
to
jesus
right
away
and
let
meet
in
yon
beautiful
land
that
just
the
one
thing
wanted
just
say
lord
i
believe
help
thou
mine
unbelief
and
he
fold
you
in
his
arms
you
see
i
know
i
been
a
sinner
myself
