a
mysterious
visitor
lucile
tucker
slim
tapered
fingers
trembled
slightly
as
she
rested
them
against
a
bookcase
she
had
paused
to
steady
her
shaken
nerves
to
collect
her
wits
to
determine
what
her
next
move
should
be
who
can
it
be
her
madly
thumping
heart
kept
asking
her
and
indeed
who
besides
herself
could
be
in
the
book
stacks
at
this
hour
of
the
night
about
her
ranging
tier
on
tier
towering
from
floor
to
ceiling
were
books
thousands
on
thousands
of
books
the
two
floors
above
were
full
of
books
the
two
below
were
the
same
this
place
was
a
perfect
maze
of
books
it
was
one
of
the
sections
of
a
great
library
the
library
of
one
of
the
finest
universities
of
the
united
states
in
all
this
vast
city
of
books
she
had
thought
herself
quite
alone
it
was
a
ghostly
hour
midnight
in
the
towers
the
great
clock
had
slowly
struck
besides
the
striking
of
the
clock
there
had
been
but
a
single
sound
the
click
of
an
electric
light
snapped
on
there
had
instantly
gleamed
at
her
feet
a
single
ray
of
light
that
light
had
traveled
beneath
many
tiers
of
books
to
reach
her
she
thought
it
must
be
four
but
was
not
quite
sure
she
had
been
preparing
to
leave
the
maze
as
she
often
called
the
stacks
of
books
which
loomed
all
about
her
so
familiar
was
she
with
the
interior
of
this
building
that
she
needed
no
light
to
guide
her
to
her
right
was
a
spiral
stairway
which
like
an
auger
bored
its
way
to
the
ground
four
stories
below
straight
ahead
twenty
tiers
of
books
away
was
a
small
electric
elevator
used
only
for
lifting
or
lowering
piles
of
books
fourteen
tiers
back
was
a
straight
stairway
to
a
person
unfamiliar
with
it
the
stacks
presented
a
bewildering
labyrinth
but
to
lucile
they
were
an
open
book
she
had
intended
making
her
way
back
to
the
straight
stairway
which
led
to
the
door
by
which
she
must
leave
but
now
she
clutched
at
her
heart
as
she
asked
herself
once
more
who
can
it
be
and
what
does
he
want
only
one
thing
stood
out
clearly
in
her
bewildered
brain
since
she
was
connected
with
the
stacks
as
one
of
their
keepers
it
was
plainly
her
duty
to
discover
who
this
intruder
might
be
and
if
occasion
seemed
to
warrant
to
report
the
case
to
her
superiors
the
university
owned
many
rare
and
valuable
books
she
had
often
wondered
that
so
many
of
these
were
kept
not
in
vaults
but
in
open
shelves
her
heart
gave
a
new
bound
of
terror
as
she
remembered
that
some
of
these
the
most
valuable
of
all
were
at
the
very
spot
from
which
the
light
came
oh
shame
why
be
so
foolish
she
whispered
to
herself
suddenly
probably
some
professor
with
a
probably
but
what
the
use
i
got
to
find
out
with
that
she
began
moving
stealthily
along
the
narrow
passageway
which
lay
between
the
stacks
tiptoeing
along
with
her
heart
thumping
so
loudly
she
could
not
help
feeling
it
might
be
heard
she
advanced
step
by
step
until
she
stood
beside
the
end
of
the
stack
nearest
the
strange
intruder
there
for
a
few
seconds
she
stuck
the
last
ounce
of
courage
had
oozed
out
she
must
await
its
return
then
with
a
sudden
burst
of
courage
she
swung
round
the
corner
the
next
instant
she
was
obliged
to
exert
all
her
available
energy
to
suppress
a
laugh
standing
in
the
circle
of
light
was
not
some
burly
robber
but
a
child
a
very
small
and
innocent
looking
child
yet
a
second
glance
told
her
that
the
child
was
older
than
she
looked
her
face
showed
that
old
as
the
face
was
the
body
of
the
child
appeared
tiny
as
a
sparrow
a
green
velvet
blouse
of
some
strangely
foreign
weave
a
coarse
skirt
a
pair
of
heavy
shoes
unnoticeable
stockings
and
that
face
all
this
flashed
into
her
vision
for
a
second
then
all
was
darkness
the
light
had
been
snapped
out
the
action
was
so
sudden
and
unexpected
that
for
a
few
seconds
the
young
librarian
stood
where
she
was
motionless
wild
questions
raced
through
her
mind
who
was
the
child
what
was
she
doing
in
the
library
at
this
unearthly
hour
how
had
she
gotten
in
how
did
she
expect
to
get
out
she
had
a
vaguely
uneasy
feeling
that
the
child
carried
a
package
what
could
that
be
other
than
books
a
second
question
suddenly
disturbed
her
who
was
this
child
had
she
seen
her
before
she
felt
sure
she
had
but
where
where
all
this
questioning
took
but
seconds
the
next
turn
found
her
mind
focused
on
the
one
important
question
which
way
had
the
child
gone
as
if
in
answer
to
her
question
her
alert
ears
caught
the
soft
of
footsteps
she
going
on
to
my
right
she
whispered
to
herself
that
good
there
is
no
exit
in
that
direction
only
windows
and
an
impossible
drop
of
fifty
feet
i
tiptoe
along
throw
on
the
general
switch
catch
her
at
that
end
and
find
out
why
she
is
here
probably
accepting
a
dare
or
going
through
with
some
childish
prank
hastily
she
tiptoed
down
the
aisle
between
the
stacks
then
turning
to
her
left
she
put
out
her
hand
touched
a
switch
and
released
a
flood
of
light
at
first
its
brightness
blinded
her
the
next
instant
she
stared
about
her
in
astonishment
the
place
was
empty
deserted
as
a
tomb
she
whispered
and
so
it
was
not
a
trace
of
the
child
was
to
be
seen
as
if
i
had
seen
her
at
all
she
murmured
i
do
believe
in
ghosts
but
where
have
i
seen
that
face
before
you
never
forget
it
once
you
seen
it
and
i
have
seen
it
but
where
meditatively
she
walked
to
the
dummy
elevator
which
carried
books
up
and
down
she
started
as
her
glance
fell
upon
it
the
carrier
had
been
on
this
floor
when
she
left
it
not
fifteen
minutes
before
now
it
was
gone
the
button
that
released
it
was
pressed
in
for
the
ground
floor
she
could
have
she
murmured
the
compartment
is
over
two
feet
square
she
stared
again
then
she
pressed
the
button
for
the
return
of
the
elevator
the
car
moved
silently
upward
to
stop
at
her
door
there
was
nothing
about
it
to
show
that
it
had
been
used
for
unusual
purposes
and
yet
she
might
have
she
mused
she
was
so
tiny
she
might
have
pressed
herself
into
it
and
ridden
down
suddenly
she
switched
off
the
lights
and
hurried
to
a
window
did
she
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
retreating
figure
at
the
far
side
of
the
campus
she
could
not
be
sure
the
lights
were
flickering
uncertain
well
she
shook
herself
then
shivered
i
guess
that
about
all
of
that
ought
to
report
it
but
i
wo
they
only
laugh
at
me
again
she
shivered
then
turning
tiptoed
down
the
narrow
passageway
to
carry
out
her
original
intention
of
going
out
of
the
building
by
way
of
the
back
stairs
her
room
was
only
a
half
block
away
in
a
dormitory
on
the
corner
of
the
campus
nearest
the
library
having
reached
the
dormitory
she
went
to
her
room
and
began
disrobing
for
the
night
in
the
bed
near
her
own
wrapped
in
profound
sleep
lay
her
roommate
she
wished
to
waken
her
to
tell
her
of
the
strange
event
of
the
night
for
a
moment
she
stood
with
the
name
florence
quivering
on
her
lips
the
word
died
unspoken
no
use
to
trouble
her
she
decided
she
been
working
hard
lately
and
needs
the
sleep
at
last
clad
in
her
dream
robes
with
her
abundant
hair
streaming
down
her
back
and
her
white
arms
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
she
sat
down
by
the
open
window
to
think
and
dream
it
was
a
wonderful
picture
that
lay
spread
out
before
her
a
vista
of
magnificent
gothic
structures
of
gray
sandstone
framed
in
lawns
of
perfectly
kept
green
sidewalks
wound
here
there
everywhere
swarming
with
students
during
the
waking
hours
they
were
silent
now
her
bosom
swelled
with
a
strange
inexpressible
emotion
as
she
realized
that
she
a
mere
girl
was
a
part
of
it
all
like
her
roommate
she
was
one
of
the
thousands
of
girls
who
attend
the
splendid
universities
of
our
land
with
little
money
of
humble
parentage
they
are
yet
given
an
opportunity
to
make
their
way
toward
a
higher
and
broader
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
life
through
study
in
the
university
the
thought
that
this
university
was
possessed
of
fifty
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
property
yet
had
time
and
patience
to
make
a
place
for
her
both
awed
and
inspired
her
the
very
thought
of
her
position
sobered
her
four
hours
each
week
day
she
worked
in
the
stacks
at
the
library
books
that
had
been
read
and
returned
came
down
to
her
and
by
her
hands
were
placed
in
their
particular
niches
of
the
labyrinth
of
stacks
the
work
was
not
work
to
her
but
recreation
play
she
was
a
lover
of
books
just
to
touch
them
was
a
delight
to
handle
them
to
work
with
them
to
keep
them
in
their
places
accessible
to
all
this
was
joy
indeed
yet
this
work
which
was
play
to
her
went
far
toward
paying
her
way
in
the
university
and
at
this
thought
her
brow
clouded
she
recalled
once
more
the
occurrence
of
a
short
time
before
and
the
strange
little
face
among
the
stacks
she
knew
that
she
ought
to
tell
the
head
of
her
section
of
the
library
downers
of
the
incident
should
anything
happen
should
some
book
be
missing
she
would
then
be
free
from
suspicion
should
suspicion
fall
upon
her
she
might
be
deprived
of
her
position
and
from
lack
of
funds
be
obliged
to
give
up
her
cherished
dream
a
university
education
but
i
do
want
to
tell
she
whispered
to
the
library
tower
which
like
some
kindly
old
gentleman
seemed
to
be
accusing
her
i
do
want
to
hardly
had
she
said
this
than
she
realized
that
there
was
a
stronger
reason
than
her
fear
of
derision
that
held
her
back
from
telling
it
the
face
she
told
herself
that
poor
little
kiddie
face
it
was
beautiful
no
not
quite
that
but
appealing
frankly
fearlessly
appealing
if
i
saw
her
take
a
book
i
could
believe
that
she
meant
to
steal
it
or
at
least
that
it
was
she
who
willed
it
but
she
laughed
a
low
laugh
throwing
back
her
head
until
her
hair
danced
over
her
white
shoulders
like
a
golden
shower
why
borrow
trouble
she
probably
took
nothing
it
was
but
a
childish
prank
at
that
she
threw
back
the
covers
of
her
bed
thrust
her
feet
deep
down
beneath
them
and
lay
down
to
rest
was
sunday
no
work
no
study
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
to
think
she
believed
that
she
had
dismissed
the
scene
in
the
library
from
her
mind
yet
even
as
she
fell
asleep
something
seemed
to
tell
her
that
she
was
mistaken
that
the
child
had
really
stolen
a
book
that
there
were
breakers
ahead
and
that
something
whispered
truth
for
this
little
incident
was
but
the
beginning
of
a
series
of
adventures
such
as
a
college
girl
seldom
is
called
upon
to
experience
being
ignorant
of
all
this
she
fell
asleep
to
dream
sweet
dreams
while
the
moon
out
of
a
cloudless
sky
beaming
down
upon
the
faultless
campus
seemed
at
times
to
take
one
look
in
at
her
open
window
chapter
ii
elusive
shakespeare
the
sun
had
been
up
for
more
than
an
hour
when
on
the
following
morning
lucile
lifted
her
head
sleepily
and
looked
at
the
clock
sunday
morning
i
glad
she
exclaimed
as
she
leaped
out
of
bed
and
raced
away
for
a
cold
shower
as
she
dressed
she
experienced
a
sensation
of
something
unfinished
and
at
the
same
time
a
desire
to
hide
something
to
defend
someone
at
first
she
could
not
understand
what
it
all
meant
then
like
a
flash
the
occurrence
of
the
previous
night
flashed
upon
her
oh
that
she
breathed
she
was
surprised
to
find
that
her
desire
to
shield
the
child
had
gained
tremendously
in
strength
while
she
slept
perhaps
there
are
forces
we
know
nothing
of
which
work
on
the
inner
hidden
chambers
of
our
mind
while
we
sleep
and
having
worked
there
leave
impressions
which
determine
our
very
destinies
lucile
was
not
enough
of
a
philosopher
to
reason
this
all
out
she
merely
knew
that
she
did
not
want
to
tell
anyone
of
the
strange
incident
no
not
even
her
roommate
and
in
the
end
that
was
just
what
happened
she
told
no
one
when
she
went
back
to
her
work
on
monday
night
a
whole
busy
day
had
passed
in
the
library
thousands
of
books
had
shot
up
the
dummy
elevator
to
have
their
cards
stamped
and
to
be
given
out
thousands
had
been
returned
to
their
places
on
their
shelves
was
a
single
book
missing
were
two
or
three
missing
lucile
had
no
way
of
knowing
every
book
that
had
gone
out
had
been
recorded
but
to
look
over
these
records
then
to
check
back
and
see
if
others
were
missing
would
be
the
work
of
weeks
she
could
only
await
developments
she
was
surprised
at
the
speed
with
which
these
developments
came
downers
the
superintendent
was
noted
for
his
exact
knowledge
regarding
the
whereabouts
of
the
books
which
were
under
his
care
she
had
not
been
working
an
hour
when
a
quiet
voice
spoke
to
her
and
with
a
little
start
she
turned
to
face
her
superior
miss
tucker
the
librarian
smiled
do
you
chance
to
have
any
knowledge
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
first
volume
of
our
early
edition
of
shakespeare
why
no
the
girl
replied
quickly
why
er
there
was
a
catch
in
her
throat
is
it
gone
downers
nodded
as
he
replied
seems
temporarily
so
to
be
misplaced
no
doubt
will
show
up
later
he
was
still
smiling
but
there
were
wrinkles
in
his
usually
placid
brow
i
missed
it
just
now
he
went
on
strange
too
i
saw
it
there
only
saturday
the
set
was
to
be
removed
from
the
library
to
be
placed
in
the
noyes
museum
considered
too
valuable
to
be
kept
in
the
library
very
early
edition
you
know
strange
he
puzzled
it
could
not
have
been
taken
out
on
the
car
as
it
was
used
only
in
the
reference
reading
room
it
not
there
i
just
phoned
however
it
will
turn
up
do
worry
about
it
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
was
gone
lucile
stared
after
him
she
wanted
to
call
him
back
to
tell
him
that
it
was
not
all
right
that
it
would
not
turn
up
that
the
strangely
quaint
little
person
she
had
seen
in
the
library
at
midnight
had
carried
it
away
yet
she
said
not
a
word
merely
allowed
him
to
pass
away
it
was
as
if
there
was
a
hand
over
her
mouth
forbidding
her
to
speak
there
ca
be
a
bit
of
doubt
about
it
she
told
herself
that
girl
was
standing
right
by
the
shelf
where
the
ancient
shakespeare
was
kept
she
took
it
i
wonder
why
i
wonder
if
she
come
back
why
of
course
she
will
for
the
other
volume
or
to
return
the
one
she
has
perhaps
two
volumes
were
too
heavy
for
those
slim
shoulders
come
back
and
then
she
sha
escape
me
i
catch
her
in
the
act
then
i
find
out
the
reason
why
so
great
was
her
faith
in
this
bit
of
reasoning
that
she
resolved
that
without
telling
a
single
person
about
the
affair
she
would
set
a
watch
that
very
night
for
the
mysterious
child
and
the
elusive
shakespeare
she
must
solve
the
puzzle
that
night
as
she
sat
in
the
darkened
library
listening
waiting
she
allowed
her
mind
to
recall
in
a
dim
and
dreamy
way
the
face
and
form
of
the
mysterious
child
as
she
dreamed
thus
there
suddenly
flashed
into
the
foreground
from
the
deepest
depths
of
her
memory
the
time
and
circumstance
on
which
she
had
first
seen
that
child
she
saw
it
all
as
in
a
dream
the
girl
had
been
dressed
just
as
she
was
saturday
at
midnight
she
had
entered
the
stacks
that
had
been
a
month
before
she
had
appeared
leading
an
exceedingly
old
man
bent
with
the
weight
of
years
leaning
upon
a
cane
all
but
blind
the
old
man
had
moved
with
a
strangely
youthful
eagerness
he
had
been
allowed
to
enter
the
stacks
only
by
special
request
he
was
an
aged
frenchman
a
lover
of
books
he
wished
to
come
near
the
books
to
sense
them
to
see
them
with
his
eyes
to
touch
them
with
his
faltering
hands
so
the
little
girl
had
guided
him
forward
from
time
to
time
he
had
asked
that
he
be
allowed
to
handle
certain
volumes
he
had
touched
each
with
a
reverent
hand
his
touch
had
resembled
a
caress
some
few
he
had
opened
and
had
felt
along
the
covers
i
wonder
why
he
did
that
lucile
had
thought
to
herself
she
paused
a
sudden
thought
had
flashed
into
her
mind
at
the
risk
of
missing
her
quarry
she
groped
her
way
to
the
shelf
where
the
companion
to
the
stolen
volume
lay
and
took
it
down
slowly
she
ran
her
fingers
over
the
inner
part
of
the
cover
yes
she
whispered
there
is
something
she
dared
not
flash
on
the
light
to
do
so
might
betray
her
presence
in
the
building
she
would
see
replacing
the
volume
in
its
accustomed
niche
she
again
tiptoed
to
her
post
of
waiting
as
she
thought
of
it
now
she
began
to
realize
what
a
large
part
her
unconscious
memory
had
played
in
her
longing
to
shield
the
child
she
had
seen
the
child
render
a
service
to
a
feeble
and
all
but
helpless
old
man
her
memory
had
been
trying
to
tell
her
of
this
but
had
only
now
broken
through
into
her
wakeful
mind
lucile
was
aroused
by
the
thought
i
must
save
her
she
told
herself
i
must
i
must
even
with
this
resolve
came
a
perplexing
problem
why
had
the
child
taken
the
book
had
she
done
so
at
the
old
man
direction
that
seemed
incredible
could
an
old
man
tottering
to
his
grave
revealing
in
spite
of
his
shabby
clothing
a
more
than
common
intellect
and
a
breeding
above
the
average
stoop
to
theft
the
theft
of
a
book
and
could
he
above
all
induce
an
innocent
child
to
join
him
in
the
deed
it
was
unthinkable
that
man
she
thought
to
herself
why
he
had
a
noble
bearing
like
a
soldier
almost
certainly
like
a
gentleman
he
reminded
me
of
that
great
old
general
of
his
own
nation
who
said
to
his
men
when
the
enemy
were
all
but
upon
paris
must
not
pass
could
he
stoop
to
stealing
these
problems
remained
all
unsolved
for
on
that
night
no
slightest
footfall
was
heard
in
the
silent
labyrinth
the
next
night
was
the
same
and
the
next
lucile
was
growing
weary
with
her
vigil
she
had
told
florence
nothing
yet
she
had
surprised
her
roommate
often
looking
at
her
in
a
way
which
said
why
are
you
out
so
late
every
night
why
do
you
share
things
with
your
pal
and
she
wanted
to
but
something
held
her
back
thursday
night
came
with
a
raging
torrent
of
rain
it
was
not
her
night
at
the
library
she
would
gladly
have
remained
in
her
cozy
room
wrapped
in
a
kimono
studying
yet
as
the
chimes
pealed
out
the
notes
of
auld
lang
syne
telling
that
the
hour
of
ten
had
arrived
she
hurried
into
her
rubbers
and
ulster
to
face
the
tempest
wild
streaks
of
lightning
faced
her
at
the
threshold
a
gust
of
wind
seized
her
and
hurried
her
along
for
an
instant
then
in
a
wild
freakish
turn
all
but
threw
her
upon
the
pavement
a
deluge
of
rain
seeming
to
extinguish
the
very
street
light
beat
down
upon
her
how
foolish
i
am
she
muttered
she
would
not
come
on
a
night
like
this
and
yet
she
did
come
lucile
had
not
been
in
her
hiding
place
more
than
a
half
hour
when
she
caught
the
familiar
of
footsteps
this
time
she
shall
not
escape
me
she
whispered
as
with
bated
breath
and
cushioned
footstep
she
tiptoed
toward
the
spot
where
the
remaining
shakespeare
rested
now
she
was
three
stacks
away
as
she
paused
to
listen
she
knew
the
child
was
at
the
same
distance
in
the
opposite
direction
she
moved
one
stack
nearer
then
listened
again
she
heard
nothing
what
had
happened
the
child
had
paused
had
she
heard
lucile
first
impulse
was
to
snap
on
a
light
she
hesitated
and
in
hesitating
lost
there
came
a
sudden
glare
of
light
a
child
face
was
framed
in
it
a
puzzled
frightened
face
a
slender
hand
went
out
and
up
a
book
came
down
the
light
went
out
and
all
this
happened
with
such
incredible
speed
that
lucile
stood
glued
to
her
tracks
through
it
all
she
leaped
toward
the
dummy
elevator
only
to
hear
the
faint
click
which
told
that
it
was
descending
she
could
not
stop
it
the
child
was
gone
she
dashed
to
a
window
which
was
on
the
elevated
station
side
a
few
seconds
of
waiting
and
the
lightning
rewarded
her
in
the
midst
of
a
blinding
flash
she
caught
sight
of
a
tiny
figure
crossing
a
broad
stretch
of
green
the
next
instant
with
rubbers
in
one
hand
and
ulster
in
the
other
she
dashed
down
the
stairs
i
get
her
yet
she
breathed
she
belongs
down
town
she
take
the
elevated
there
is
a
car
in
seven
minutes
i
make
it
too
then
we
shall
see
chapter
iii
the
gargoyle
down
a
long
stretch
of
sidewalk
across
a
sunken
patch
of
green
where
the
water
was
to
her
ankles
down
a
street
through
pools
of
black
water
where
sewers
were
choked
lucile
dashed
with
no
thought
for
health
or
safety
she
exposed
herself
to
the
blinding
tempest
and
dashed
before
skidding
autos
to
arrive
at
last
panting
at
the
foot
of
the
rusted
iron
stairs
that
led
to
the
elevated
railway
platform
pausing
only
long
enough
to
catch
her
breath
and
arrange
her
garments
that
the
child
might
not
be
frightened
away
by
her
appearance
she
hurried
up
the
stairs
the
train
came
thundering
in
there
was
just
time
to
thrust
a
dime
through
the
wicker
window
and
to
bound
for
the
door
catching
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
the
dripping
figure
of
the
child
she
made
a
dash
for
that
car
and
made
it
a
moment
later
with
her
ulster
thrown
over
on
the
seat
beside
her
she
found
herself
facing
the
child
sitting
there
curled
up
in
a
corner
as
she
now
was
hugging
a
bulky
package
wrapped
in
oilcloth
the
child
seemed
older
and
tinier
than
ever
how
could
she
do
it
was
lucile
unspoken
question
as
she
watched
the
water
oozing
from
her
shoes
to
to
the
floor
below
with
the
question
came
a
blind
resolve
to
see
the
thing
through
to
the
end
this
child
was
not
the
real
culprit
cost
what
it
might
she
would
find
who
was
behind
her
strange
actions
there
is
no
place
in
all
the
world
where
a
thunderstorm
seems
more
terrible
than
in
the
deserted
streets
in
the
heart
of
a
great
city
at
night
echoing
and
between
the
towering
walls
of
buildings
the
thunder
seems
to
be
speaking
to
the
universe
flashing
from
a
thousand
windows
to
ten
thousand
others
the
lightning
seems
to
be
searching
the
haunts
and
homes
of
men
the
whole
wild
fury
of
it
seems
but
the
voice
of
nature
defying
man
in
his
great
stronghold
the
city
it
is
as
if
in
thundering
tones
she
would
tell
him
that
great
as
he
may
imagine
himself
he
is
not
a
law
unto
himself
and
can
never
be
into
the
heart
of
a
great
city
on
a
night
like
this
the
elevated
train
carried
lucile
and
the
child
on
the
face
of
the
child
thief
as
she
undoubtedly
was
and
with
the
stolen
goods
in
her
possession
there
flashed
not
one
tremor
not
a
falling
of
an
eyelash
which
might
be
thought
of
as
a
sign
of
fear
of
laws
of
nature
man
or
god
was
she
hardened
or
completely
innocent
of
guilt
who
at
that
moment
could
tell
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
a
more
desolate
spot
than
that
in
which
the
car
discharged
its
two
passengers
as
lucile
eye
saw
the
sea
of
dreary
tenements
and
tumbledown
cottages
that
like
cattle
left
out
in
the
storm
hovered
beside
the
elevated
tracks
she
shivered
and
was
tempted
to
turn
back
yet
she
went
on
a
half
block
from
the
station
she
passed
a
policeman
again
she
hesitated
the
child
was
but
a
half
block
before
her
she
suspected
nothing
it
would
be
so
easy
to
say
to
the
policeman
stop
that
child
she
is
a
thief
she
has
stolen
property
concealed
beneath
her
cape
the
law
would
then
take
its
course
and
lucile
hands
would
be
free
yet
something
urged
her
past
the
policeman
down
a
narrow
street
round
a
corner
up
a
second
street
down
a
third
still
narrower
and
up
to
the
door
of
the
smallest
shabbiest
cottage
of
the
whole
lot
the
child
had
entered
here
lucile
paused
to
consider
and
while
considering
caught
the
gleam
of
light
through
a
torn
window
shade
the
cottage
was
one
story
and
a
garret
the
window
was
within
her
range
of
vision
after
a
glance
from
left
to
right
she
stepped
beneath
the
porch
which
gave
her
an
opportunity
to
peer
through
the
opening
here
deep
in
the
shadows
she
might
look
on
at
the
scene
within
without
herself
being
observed
by
those
within
or
by
on
the
street
the
picture
which
came
to
her
through
the
hole
in
the
shade
was
so
different
from
that
which
one
might
expect
that
she
barely
suppressed
a
gasp
in
the
room
which
was
scrupulously
clean
and
tidy
there
were
but
two
persons
the
child
and
the
old
man
who
had
visited
the
library
through
the
grate
of
a
small
stove
a
fire
gleamed
before
this
fire
all
unabashed
the
child
stripped
the
clothing
from
her
meager
body
then
stood
chafing
her
limbs
which
were
purple
with
cold
the
old
man
appeared
all
absorbed
in
his
inspection
of
the
book
just
placed
in
his
hands
lucile
was
not
surprised
to
recognize
it
as
the
second
shakespeare
from
turning
it
over
and
over
he
paused
to
open
it
and
peer
at
its
inside
cover
not
satisfied
with
this
he
ran
his
finger
over
the
upper
outside
corner
it
was
then
that
lucile
saw
for
the
first
time
the
thing
she
had
felt
while
in
the
library
in
the
dark
a
small
square
of
paper
yellow
with
age
was
in
that
corner
and
in
its
center
was
a
picture
of
a
gargoyle
a
strange
looking
creation
was
this
gargoyle
it
was
with
such
as
these
the
ancients
were
wont
to
decorate
their
mansions
with
a
savage
face
that
was
half
man
and
half
lion
he
possessed
the
paws
of
a
beast
and
the
wings
of
a
great
bird
about
two
sides
of
this
picture
was
a
letter
so
that
was
it
she
breathed
the
next
moment
her
attention
was
attracted
by
a
set
of
shelves
these
ran
across
one
entire
end
of
the
room
and
save
for
a
single
foot
of
space
were
entirely
filled
with
books
the
striking
fact
to
be
noted
was
that
if
one
were
able
to
judge
from
the
appearance
of
their
books
they
must
all
of
them
be
of
great
age
a
miser
of
books
she
breathed
searching
these
shelves
she
felt
sure
she
located
the
other
missing
volume
of
shakespeare
this
decision
was
confirmed
at
last
as
the
tottering
old
man
made
his
way
to
the
shelf
and
filled
some
two
inches
of
the
remaining
vacant
by
placing
the
book
beside
its
mate
after
this
he
stood
there
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
two
books
the
expression
on
his
face
was
startling
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
it
appeared
to
prove
her
charge
of
book
miser
to
be
false
this
was
not
the
look
of
a
shylock
more
like
a
father
glorying
over
the
return
of
a
child
she
told
herself
as
she
stood
there
puzzling
over
this
the
room
went
suddenly
dark
the
occupants
of
the
house
had
doubtless
gone
to
another
part
of
the
cottage
to
retire
for
the
night
she
was
left
with
two
alternatives
to
call
a
policeman
and
have
the
place
raided
or
to
return
quietly
to
the
university
and
think
the
thing
through
she
chose
the
latter
course
after
discovering
the
number
of
the
house
and
fixing
certain
landmarks
in
her
mind
she
returned
to
the
elevated
station
they
not
dispose
of
the
books
that
certain
she
told
herself
the
course
to
be
taken
in
the
future
will
come
to
me
stealing
silently
into
her
room
on
her
return
she
was
surprised
to
find
her
roommate
awake
robed
in
a
kimono
and
pacing
the
floor
why
florence
she
breathed
why
yourself
florence
turned
upon
her
where
you
been
in
all
this
storm
five
minutes
more
and
i
should
have
called
the
matron
she
would
have
notified
the
police
and
then
things
would
have
been
fine
grand
can
you
see
it
in
the
morning
papers
mysteriously
disappears
from
university
dormitory
in
storm
no
trace
of
her
yet
found
roommate
says
no
cause
for
suicide
oh
gasped
lucile
you
would
have
what
else
could
i
do
how
was
i
to
know
what
had
happened
you
breathed
a
word
you
florence
sat
down
upon
her
bed
dug
her
bare
toes
into
the
rug
and
stared
at
her
roommate
for
once
in
her
life
strong
dependable
imperturbable
florence
was
excited
i
know
said
lucile
removing
her
watersoaked
dress
and
stockings
and
chafing
her
benumbed
feet
i
i
guess
i
should
have
told
you
about
it
but
it
was
something
i
was
quite
sure
you
would
understand
so
i
did
that
all
but
now
now
i
got
to
tell
someone
or
i
burst
and
i
rather
tell
you
than
anyone
else
i
know
thanks
florence
smiled
just
for
that
i
help
you
into
dry
clothes
then
you
can
tell
me
in
comfort
the
clock
struck
three
and
the
girls
were
still
deep
in
the
discussion
of
the
mystery
one
thing
is
important
said
florence
that
is
the
value
of
the
shakespeare
perhaps
it
not
worth
so
terribly
much
after
all
perhaps
not
lucile
wrinkled
her
brow
but
i
am
awfully
afraid
it
is
let
see
who
could
tell
me
oh
i
know
frank
morrow
who
frank
morrow
he
the
best
authority
on
old
books
there
is
in
the
united
states
he
right
here
in
this
city
got
a
cute
little
shop
on
the
fifteenth
floor
of
the
marshal
annex
building
he
an
old
friend
of
my
father
he
tell
me
anything
i
need
to
know
about
books
all
right
you
better
see
him
or
i
mean
and
now
for
three
winks
florence
threw
off
her
kimono
and
leaped
into
bed
lucile
followed
her
example
and
the
next
instant
the
room
was
dark
chapter
iv
what
the
gargoyle
might
tell
frank
morrow
was
the
type
of
man
any
girl
might
be
glad
to
claim
as
a
friend
he
had
passed
his
birthday
and
for
years
he
had
been
a
dealer
in
old
books
yet
he
was
neither
stooped
nor
a
man
of
broad
shoulders
and
robust
frame
he
delighted
as
much
in
a
low
morning
score
at
golf
as
he
did
in
the
discovery
of
a
rare
old
book
his
hair
was
white
but
his
cheeks
retained
much
of
their
ruddy
glow
his
quiet
smile
gave
to
all
who
visited
his
shop
a
feeling
of
genuine
welcome
which
they
did
not
soon
forget
his
shop
like
himself
reflected
the
new
era
which
has
dawned
in
the
old
book
business
men
have
come
to
realize
that
age
lends
worth
to
books
that
possessed
real
worth
in
the
beginning
and
they
are
coming
to
house
them
well
on
one
of
the
upper
floors
of
a
modern
business
block
frank
morrow
shop
was
flooded
with
sunshine
and
fresh
air
a
potted
plant
bloomed
on
his
desk
the
books
arranged
neatly
without
a
painful
effort
at
order
presented
the
appearance
of
some
rich
gentleman
library
a
darker
corner
a
room
by
itself
to
the
right
and
back
suggested
privacy
and
seclusion
and
here
frank
morrow
finds
were
kept
many
of
them
were
richly
bound
and
autographed
the
wise
and
the
rich
of
the
world
passed
through
frank
morrow
shop
for
in
his
brain
there
rested
knowledge
which
no
other
living
man
could
impart
did
a
bishop
wish
to
purchase
an
book
for
his
ecclesiastical
library
he
came
to
frank
morrow
to
ask
where
it
might
be
found
did
the
prince
of
the
steel
market
wish
a
folio
edition
of
audubon
birds
of
america
he
came
to
frank
and
somewhere
in
boston
new
york
philadelphia
frank
found
it
for
him
authors
came
to
him
and
artists
as
well
not
so
much
for
what
he
could
find
for
them
as
for
what
he
might
impart
in
the
way
of
genial
friendship
and
the
lore
of
books
it
was
to
this
man
and
this
shop
that
lucile
made
her
way
next
morning
she
was
not
prepared
to
confide
in
him
to
the
extent
of
telling
him
the
whole
story
of
her
mystery
for
she
did
not
know
him
well
he
was
her
father
friend
that
was
all
she
did
wish
to
tell
him
that
she
was
in
trouble
and
to
ask
his
opinion
of
the
probable
value
of
the
set
of
shakespeare
which
had
been
removed
from
the
university
library
well
now
he
smiled
as
he
adjusted
his
glasses
after
she
had
asked
her
question
i
be
glad
to
help
you
if
i
can
but
i
not
sure
that
i
can
there
are
shakespeares
and
other
shakespeares
i
do
know
the
university
set
did
buy
it
for
them
probably
a
donation
from
some
rich
man
it
might
be
a
folio
edition
in
that
case
well
he
paused
and
smiled
again
i
trust
you
have
burned
this
shakespeare
by
mistake
nor
had
it
stolen
from
your
room
or
anything
like
that
no
oh
no
not
nothing
like
that
exclaimed
lucile
well
as
i
was
about
to
say
i
found
a
very
nice
folio
edition
for
a
rich
friend
of
mine
not
so
very
long
ago
the
sale
of
it
i
think
was
the
record
for
this
city
it
cost
him
eighteen
thousand
dollars
lucile
gasped
then
sat
staring
at
him
in
astonishment
eighteen
thousand
dollars
she
managed
to
murmur
at
last
of
course
you
understand
that
was
a
folio
edition
very
rare
there
are
other
old
editions
that
are
cheaper
much
cheaper
i
i
hope
so
murmured
lucile
would
you
like
to
see
some
old
books
and
get
a
notion
of
their
value
he
asked
indeed
i
would
step
in
here
he
led
the
way
into
the
mysterious
dark
room
there
he
switched
on
a
light
to
reveal
walls
packed
with
books
here
a
little
thing
he
smiled
taking
down
a
volume
which
would
fit
comfortably
into
a
man
coat
pocket
walton
compleat
angler
it
a
first
edition
bound
in
temporary
binding
vellum
what
would
you
say
it
was
worth
i
i
could
guess
please
do
make
me
lucile
pleaded
sixteen
hundred
dollars
again
lucile
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
that
little
book
you
see
he
said
motioning
her
a
seat
rare
books
like
many
other
rare
things
derive
their
value
from
their
scarcity
the
first
edition
of
this
book
was
very
small
being
small
and
comparatively
cheap
the
larger
number
of
the
books
were
worn
out
destroyed
or
lost
so
the
remaining
books
have
come
to
possess
great
value
the
story
he
came
to
an
abrupt
pause
arrested
by
a
look
of
astonishment
on
the
girl
face
as
she
gazed
at
the
book
he
held
why
what
he
began
that
lucile
pointed
to
a
raised
monogram
in
the
upper
inside
cover
of
the
book
a
private
mark
explained
morrow
many
rich
men
and
men
of
noble
birth
in
the
past
had
private
marks
which
they
put
in
their
books
the
custom
seems
to
be
as
old
as
books
themselves
men
do
it
still
let
see
what
is
that
one
an
embossed
around
two
sides
of
the
picture
of
a
gargoyle
said
lucile
in
as
steady
a
tone
as
she
could
command
ah
yes
a
very
unusual
one
in
all
my
experience
i
have
seen
but
five
books
with
that
mark
in
them
all
have
passed
through
my
hands
during
the
past
two
years
and
yet
this
mark
is
a
very
old
one
see
how
yellow
the
paper
is
probably
some
foreign
library
many
rare
books
came
across
the
sea
during
the
war
i
believe
he
paused
to
reflect
then
said
with
a
tone
of
certainty
yes
i
know
that
mark
was
in
the
folio
edition
of
shakespeare
which
i
sold
last
year
his
words
caught
lucile
breath
for
the
moment
she
could
neither
move
nor
speak
the
thought
that
the
set
of
shakespeare
taken
from
the
library
might
be
the
very
set
sold
to
the
rich
man
and
worth
eighteen
thousand
dollars
struck
her
dumb
fortunately
the
dealer
did
not
notice
her
distress
but
pointing
to
the
bookmark
went
on
if
that
gargoyle
could
talk
now
if
it
could
tell
its
story
and
the
story
of
the
book
it
marks
what
a
yarn
it
might
spin
for
instance
his
eyes
half
closed
as
the
theme
gripped
him
this
mark
is
unmistakably
continental
french
or
german
french
i
say
from
the
form
of
the
and
the
type
of
gargoyle
many
men
of
wealth
and
of
noble
birth
on
the
continent
have
had
large
collections
of
books
printed
in
english
this
little
book
with
the
gargoyle
on
the
inside
of
its
cover
is
a
hundred
years
old
it
a
young
book
as
ancient
books
go
yet
what
things
have
happened
in
its
day
it
has
seen
wars
and
bloodshed
the
library
in
which
it
has
reposed
may
have
been
the
plotting
place
of
kings
knights
and
dukes
or
of
rebels
and
regicides
it
may
have
witnessed
domestic
tragedies
what
great
man
may
have
contemplated
the
destruction
of
his
wife
what
noble
lady
may
have
whispered
in
its
presence
of
some
secret
love
what
youths
and
maids
may
have
slipped
away
into
its
quiet
corner
to
utter
murmurs
of
eternal
devotion
it
may
have
been
stolen
been
carried
away
as
booty
in
war
been
pawned
with
its
mates
to
secure
a
nobleman
ransom
oh
i
tell
you
he
smiled
as
he
read
the
interest
in
her
face
there
is
romance
in
old
books
thrilling
romance
whole
libraries
have
been
stolen
and
secretly
disposed
of
chests
of
books
have
been
captured
by
pirates
here
is
a
book
a
copy
of
marco
polo
travels
a
first
edition
copy
which
tradition
tells
us
was
once
owned
by
the
renowned
pirate
captain
kidd
i
am
told
he
was
fond
of
reading
however
that
may
be
there
certainly
were
men
of
learning
among
his
crew
there
never
was
a
successful
gang
of
thieves
that
did
not
have
at
least
one
college
man
in
it
he
chuckled
at
his
own
witticism
and
lucile
smiled
with
him
well
he
said
rising
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
for
you
at
any
time
drop
in
and
ask
me
i
am
always
at
the
service
of
fair
young
ladies
one
never
grows
too
old
for
that
besides
your
father
was
my
very
good
friend
lucile
thanked
him
took
a
last
look
at
the
pocket
volume
worth
sixteen
hundred
dollars
made
a
mental
note
of
the
form
of
its
gargoyle
then
handed
it
to
him
and
left
the
room
she
little
dreamed
how
soon
and
under
what
strange
circumstances
she
would
see
that
book
again
she
left
the
shop
of
frank
morrow
in
a
strange
state
of
mind
she
felt
that
she
should
turn
the
facts
in
her
possession
over
to
the
officials
of
the
library
and
allow
them
to
deal
with
the
child
and
the
old
man
yet
there
was
something
mysterious
about
it
all
that
collector
of
books
doubtless
worth
a
fortune
in
surroundings
which
betokened
poverty
the
strange
book
mark
the
look
on
the
old
man
face
as
he
fingered
the
volume
of
shakespeare
how
explain
all
these
if
the
university
authorities
or
the
police
handled
the
case
would
they
take
time
to
solve
these
mysteries
to
handle
the
case
in
such
a
way
as
would
not
hasten
the
death
of
this
feeble
old
man
nor
blight
the
future
of
this
strange
child
she
feared
not
life
the
life
of
a
child
is
of
greater
importance
than
is
an
ancient
volume
she
told
herself
at
last
and
with
the
help
of
florence
and
perhaps
of
frank
morrow
i
will
solve
the
mystery
myself
yes
even
if
it
costs
me
my
position
and
my
hope
for
an
education
she
paused
to
stamp
the
pavement
then
hurried
away
toward
the
university
chapter
v
the
lunch
box
but
lucile
exclaimed
florence
after
she
had
heard
the
latest
development
in
the
mystery
if
the
books
are
worth
all
that
money
how
dare
you
take
the
risk
of
leaving
things
as
they
are
for
a
single
hour
we
do
know
that
they
are
that
identical
edition
but
you
say
the
gargoyle
was
there
yes
but
that
does
prove
anything
there
might
have
been
a
whole
family
of
gargoyle
libraries
for
all
we
know
besides
what
if
it
is
what
are
two
books
compared
to
the
marring
of
a
human
life
what
right
has
a
university
or
anyone
else
for
that
matter
to
have
books
worth
thousands
of
dollars
books
are
just
tools
or
playthings
that
all
they
are
men
use
them
to
shape
their
intellects
just
as
a
carpenter
uses
a
plane
or
they
use
them
for
amusement
what
would
be
the
sense
of
having
a
wood
plane
worth
eighteen
thousand
dollars
when
a
five
dollar
one
would
do
just
as
good
work
but
what
do
you
mean
to
do
about
it
asked
florence
i
going
down
there
by
that
mysterious
cottage
and
watch
what
happens
and
you
are
going
with
me
we
go
as
many
nights
as
we
have
to
if
it
necessary
we
walk
in
upon
our
mysterious
friends
and
make
them
tell
why
they
took
the
books
maybe
they
wo
tell
but
they
give
them
back
to
us
and
unless
i
mistaken
that
will
at
least
be
better
for
the
girl
than
dragging
her
into
court
oh
all
right
laughed
florence
rising
and
throwing
back
her
shoulders
i
suppose
you
taking
me
along
as
a
sort
of
bodyguard
i
do
mind
life
been
a
trifle
dull
of
late
a
little
adventure
go
so
bad
and
since
it
is
endured
in
what
you
choose
to
consider
a
righteous
cause
it
all
the
better
but
please
let
make
it
short
i
do
love
to
sleep
had
she
known
what
the
nature
of
their
adventure
was
to
be
she
might
at
least
have
paused
to
consider
but
since
the
things
we
do
know
hurt
us
she
set
to
work
planning
this
their
first
nightly
escapade
reared
as
they
had
been
in
the
far
west
and
the
great
white
north
the
two
girls
had
been
accustomed
to
wildernesses
of
mountains
forest
and
vast
expanses
of
ice
and
snow
one
might
fancy
that
for
them
even
at
night
a
great
city
would
possess
no
terrors
this
was
not
true
the
quiet
life
at
the
university
eight
miles
from
the
heart
of
the
city
had
done
little
to
rid
them
of
their
terror
of
city
streets
at
night
to
them
every
street
was
a
canyon
the
end
of
each
alley
an
entrance
to
a
den
where
beasts
of
prey
might
lurk
not
a
footfall
sounded
behind
them
but
sent
terror
to
their
hearts
lucile
had
gone
on
that
first
adventure
alone
in
the
rain
on
sudden
impulse
the
second
was
premeditated
they
coolly
plotted
the
return
to
the
narrow
street
where
the
mysterious
cottage
stood
nothing
short
of
a
desire
to
serve
someone
younger
and
weaker
than
herself
could
have
induced
lucile
to
return
to
that
region
the
very
thought
of
which
sent
a
cold
shiver
running
down
her
spine
as
for
florence
she
was
a
devoted
chum
of
lucile
it
was
enough
that
lucile
wished
her
to
go
other
interests
might
develop
later
for
the
present
this
was
enough
so
on
the
following
night
a
night
dark
and
cloudy
but
with
no
rain
they
stole
forth
from
the
hall
to
make
their
way
down
town
they
had
decided
that
they
would
go
to
the
window
of
the
torn
shade
and
see
what
they
might
discover
but
on
arriving
at
the
scene
decided
that
there
was
too
much
chance
of
detection
we
just
walk
up
and
down
the
street
suggested
lucile
if
she
comes
out
we
follow
her
and
see
what
happens
she
may
go
back
to
the
university
for
more
books
you
do
think
she
dare
whispered
florence
she
returned
once
why
not
again
there
are
no
more
shakespeares
but
there
are
other
books
yes
they
fell
into
silence
the
streets
were
dark
it
grew
cold
it
was
a
cheerless
task
now
and
again
a
person
passed
them
two
of
them
were
men
noisy
and
drunken
i
i
do
like
it
shivered
lucile
but
what
else
is
there
to
do
go
in
and
tell
them
they
have
our
books
and
must
give
them
up
that
would
solve
anything
it
would
get
our
books
back
yes
but
suddenly
lucile
paused
to
place
a
hand
on
her
companion
arm
a
slight
figure
had
emerged
from
the
cottage
it
the
child
she
whispered
we
must
not
seem
to
follow
let
cross
the
street
they
expected
the
child
to
enter
the
elevated
station
as
she
had
done
before
but
this
she
did
not
do
walking
at
a
rapid
pace
she
led
them
directly
toward
the
very
heart
of
the
city
after
covering
five
blocks
she
began
to
slow
down
getting
tired
was
florence
comment
more
people
here
we
could
catch
up
with
her
and
not
be
suspected
this
they
did
much
to
their
surprise
they
found
the
child
dressed
in
the
cheap
blue
calico
of
a
working
woman
daughter
what
that
for
whispered
lucile
disguise
florence
whispered
she
going
into
some
office
building
see
she
is
carrying
a
pressed
paper
lunch
box
she
get
in
anywhere
with
that
just
tell
them
she
bringing
a
hot
midnight
lunch
to
her
mother
it
strange
she
mused
when
you
think
of
it
how
many
people
work
while
we
sleep
every
morning
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
swarm
to
their
work
or
their
shopping
in
the
heart
of
the
city
and
they
find
all
the
carpets
swept
desks
and
tables
dusted
floors
and
stairs
scrubbed
and
i
bet
that
not
one
in
a
hundred
of
them
ever
pauses
to
wonder
how
it
all
comes
about
not
one
in
a
thousand
gives
a
passing
thought
to
the
poor
women
who
toil
on
hands
and
knees
with
rag
and
brush
during
the
dark
hours
of
night
that
everything
may
be
spick
and
span
in
the
morning
i
tell
you
lucile
we
ought
to
be
thankful
that
we
young
and
that
opportunities
lie
before
us
i
tell
you
she
was
stopped
by
a
grip
on
her
arm
wha
where
has
she
gone
stammered
lucille
she
vanished
and
she
was
not
twenty
feet
before
us
a
second
ago
the
two
girls
stood
staring
at
each
other
in
astonishment
the
child
had
disappeared
well
said
lucile
ruefully
i
guess
that
about
ends
this
adventure
i
guess
so
admitted
florence
the
lights
of
an
drug
store
burned
brightly
across
the
street
that
calls
for
hot
chocolate
said
florence
it
what
i
get
for
moralizing
if
i
had
been
going
on
at
such
a
rate
we
would
have
kept
sight
of
her
they
lingered
for
some
time
over
hot
chocolate
and
wafers
they
were
waiting
for
a
surface
car
to
carry
them
home
when
on
hearing
low
but
excited
words
they
turned
about
to
behold
to
their
vast
astonishment
their
little
mystery
child
being
led
along
by
the
collar
of
her
dress
the
person
dragging
her
forward
was
an
evil
looking
woman
who
appeared
slightly
the
worse
for
drink
so
that
the
trick
they
heard
her
snarl
so
you
would
run
away
such
an
ungratefulness
after
all
we
done
for
you
now
you
shall
beg
harder
than
ever
no
i
wo
beg
the
girl
answered
in
a
small
but
determined
voice
and
i
sha
steal
either
you
can
kill
me
first
well
we
see
my
fine
lady
growled
the
woman
all
this
time
the
child
was
being
dragged
forward
as
she
came
opposite
the
two
girls
the
woman
gave
a
harder
tug
than
before
and
the
girl
almost
fell
something
dropped
to
the
sidewalk
but
the
woman
did
not
notice
it
and
the
child
evidently
did
not
care
for
they
passed
on
lucile
stooped
and
picked
it
up
it
was
the
paper
lunch
box
they
had
seen
the
child
carrying
earlier
in
the
evening
something
in
it
she
said
shaking
it
lucile
said
florence
in
a
tense
whisper
are
we
going
to
let
that
beast
of
a
woman
get
that
child
she
does
belong
to
her
or
if
she
does
she
ought
to
i
good
for
a
fight
lucile
face
blanched
here
in
this
city
wilderness
she
breathed
anywhere
for
the
good
of
a
child
come
on
florence
was
away
after
the
woman
and
child
at
a
rapid
rate
we
get
the
child
free
then
we
get
out
breathed
florence
we
do
want
any
publicity
fortune
favored
their
plan
the
woman
still
dragging
the
child
who
was
by
now
silently
weeping
hurried
into
a
narrow
dismal
alley
suddenly
as
she
looked
about
at
sound
of
a
footstep
behind
her
she
was
seized
in
two
vises
and
hurled
by
some
mechanism
of
steel
and
bronze
a
dozen
feet
in
air
to
land
in
an
alley
doorway
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
her
nor
was
it
far
from
the
truth
for
florence
months
of
gymnasium
work
had
turned
her
muscles
into
things
of
steel
and
bronze
it
was
she
who
had
seized
the
woman
it
was
all
done
so
swiftly
that
the
woman
had
no
time
to
cry
out
when
she
rose
to
her
feet
the
alley
was
deserted
the
child
had
fled
in
one
direction
while
the
two
girls
had
stepped
quietly
out
into
the
street
in
the
other
direction
and
apparently
quite
unperturbed
were
waiting
for
a
car
look
said
lucile
i
still
got
it
it
the
child
lunch
basket
there
something
in
it
there
our
car
said
florence
in
a
relieved
tone
the
next
moment
they
were
rattling
homeward
we
solved
no
mystery
murmured
lucile
sleepily
added
one
more
to
the
rest
smiled
florence
but
now
i
interested
we
must
see
it
through
did
you
hear
what
the
child
said
that
she
rather
die
than
steal
wonder
what
she
calls
the
taking
of
our
shakespeare
that
part
of
our
problem
continued
in
our
next
smiled
lucile
she
set
the
dilapidated
lunch
box
which
she
had
picked
up
in
the
street
after
the
child
had
dropped
it
in
the
corner
beneath
the
cloak
rack
before
she
fell
asleep
she
thought
of
it
and
wondered
what
had
been
thumping
round
inside
of
it
probably
just
an
old
sandwich
she
told
herself
anyway
too
weary
to
get
up
and
look
now
i
look
in
the
morning
one
other
thought
entered
her
consciousness
before
she
fell
asleep
or
was
it
a
thought
perhaps
just
one
or
two
mental
pictures
the
buildings
the
street
the
electric
signs
that
had
encountered
her
gaze
as
they
first
saw
the
child
and
the
woman
passed
before
her
eye
then
almost
instantly
the
picture
of
the
street
on
which
the
building
in
which
frank
morrow
book
shop
was
located
flashed
before
her
that
queer
she
murmured
i
do
believe
they
were
the
same
and
indeed
she
thought
dreamily
why
should
they
not
be
they
are
both
down
in
the
heart
of
the
city
and
i
am
forever
losing
my
sense
of
location
down
there
at
that
she
fell
asleep
chapter
vi
one
can
never
tell
when
lucile
awoke
in
the
morning
she
remembered
the
occurrence
of
the
night
before
as
some
sort
of
bad
dream
it
seemed
inconceivable
that
she
and
florence
a
couple
of
should
have
thrown
themselves
upon
a
woman
in
the
heart
of
the
city
on
a
street
with
which
they
were
totally
unfamiliar
had
they
done
this
to
free
a
child
about
whom
they
knew
nothing
save
that
she
had
stolen
two
valuable
books
did
we
she
asked
sleepily
did
we
what
smiled
florence
drawing
the
comb
through
her
hair
did
we
rescue
that
child
from
that
woman
i
guess
we
did
why
did
we
do
it
that
what
i
been
wondering
lucile
sat
up
in
bed
and
thought
for
a
moment
she
gazed
out
of
the
window
at
the
lovely
green
and
the
magnificent
gothic
architecture
spread
out
before
her
she
thought
of
the
wretched
alleys
and
tenements
which
would
greet
the
eye
of
that
mysterious
child
when
she
awoke
anyway
she
told
herself
we
saved
her
from
something
even
worse
i
do
believe
we
sent
her
back
to
her
little
old
tottering
man
i
do
think
she
loves
him
though
who
he
is
her
grandfather
or
what
i
have
the
faintest
notion
anyway
i
glad
we
did
it
she
said
did
what
panted
florence
who
by
this
time
was
going
through
her
morning
exercises
saved
the
child
yes
so
am
i
the
lunch
box
remained
in
its
place
in
the
dark
corner
when
they
went
to
breakfast
both
girls
had
completely
forgotten
it
had
lucile
dreamed
what
it
contained
she
would
not
have
passed
it
up
for
a
thousand
breakfasts
since
she
did
she
stepped
out
into
the
bright
morning
sunshine
and
drinking
in
deep
breaths
of
god
fresh
air
gave
thanks
that
she
was
alive
the
day
passed
as
all
schooldays
pass
with
study
lectures
laboratory
work
then
dinner
as
evening
comes
in
the
evening
paper
an
advertisement
in
the
lost
strayed
or
stolen
column
caught
her
eye
it
read
reward
will
pay
reward
for
the
return
of
small
copy
of
the
compleat
angler
which
disappeared
from
the
morrow
book
shop
on
november
it
was
signed
by
frank
morrow
why
that
strange
she
murmured
i
do
believe
that
was
the
book
he
showed
me
only
yesterday
the
little
first
edition
which
was
worth
sixteen
hundred
dollars
how
strange
a
queer
sinking
sensation
came
over
her
i
i
wonder
if
she
could
have
taken
it
she
whispered
that
child
no
no
she
whispered
emphatically
after
a
moment
thought
and
yet
there
was
the
gargoyle
bookmark
in
the
inside
cover
the
same
as
in
our
shakespeare
how
strange
it
might
be
and
yet
one
can
never
tell
that
evening
was
lucile
regular
period
at
the
library
so
much
as
she
should
have
liked
delving
more
deeply
into
the
mystery
which
had
all
but
taken
possession
of
her
she
was
obliged
to
bend
over
a
desk
checking
off
books
working
with
her
was
harry
brock
a
fellow
student
harry
was
the
kind
of
fellow
one
speaks
of
oftenest
as
a
nice
boy
clean
carefully
dressed
studious
energetic
and
accurate
he
set
an
example
which
was
hard
to
follow
he
had
taken
a
brotherly
interest
in
lucile
from
the
start
and
had
helped
her
over
many
hard
places
in
the
library
until
she
learned
her
duties
shortly
after
she
had
come
in
he
paused
by
her
desk
and
said
in
a
quiet
tone
do
you
know
i
worried
about
the
disappearance
of
that
set
of
shakespeare
sort
of
gives
our
section
a
long
black
mark
ca
see
where
it
disappeared
to
lucile
drew
in
a
long
breath
what
was
he
driving
at
did
he
suspect
did
he
if
i
was
so
sure
our
records
were
perfect
he
broke
in
on
her
mental
questioning
i
say
it
was
tucked
away
somewhere
and
would
turn
up
but
we
all
been
careful
it
just
ca
be
here
he
paused
as
if
in
reflection
then
said
suddenly
do
you
think
one
would
ever
be
justified
in
protecting
a
person
whom
he
knew
had
stolen
something
lucile
started
what
did
he
mean
did
he
suspect
something
had
he
perhaps
seen
her
enter
the
library
on
one
of
those
nights
of
her
watching
did
he
suspect
her
for
a
second
the
color
rushed
flaming
to
her
cheeks
but
fortunately
he
was
looking
away
the
next
second
she
was
her
usual
calm
self
why
yes
she
said
steadily
i
think
one
might
if
one
felt
that
there
were
circumstances
about
the
apparent
theft
which
were
not
clearly
understood
you
know
she
said
as
a
sudden
inspiration
seized
her
we
just
finished
reading
victor
hugo
story
of
jean
valjean
in
french
translating
a
great
story
a
little
each
day
bit
by
bit
is
such
a
wonderful
way
of
doing
it
and
that
is
the
greatest
story
that
ever
was
written
have
you
read
it
he
nodded
well
then
you
remember
how
that
poor
fellow
stole
a
loaf
of
bread
to
feed
his
sister
hungry
children
and
how
without
trying
to
find
out
about
things
and
be
just
they
put
him
in
prison
then
because
he
tried
to
get
out
they
kept
him
there
years
and
years
then
when
they
at
last
let
him
out
in
spite
of
it
all
after
he
had
come
into
contact
with
a
beautiful
unselfish
old
man
he
became
one
of
the
most
wonderful
characters
the
world
may
hope
to
know
just
think
how
wonderful
his
earlier
years
wasted
in
prison
might
have
been
if
someone
had
only
tried
a
little
to
understand
you
good
smiled
harry
when
i
get
arrested
i
have
you
for
my
lawyer
lucile
once
more
quite
herself
laughed
heartily
then
she
suddenly
sobered
if
i
were
you
she
said
in
a
low
tone
i
should
worry
too
much
about
that
set
of
shakespeare
someway
i
have
an
idea
that
it
will
show
up
in
its
own
good
time
harry
shot
her
a
quick
look
then
as
he
turned
to
walk
away
said
in
a
tone
of
forced
lightness
oh
all
right
the
following
night
they
were
free
to
return
to
the
scene
of
the
mystery
the
cottage
on
dreary
tyler
street
where
the
old
man
and
the
strange
child
lived
a
light
shone
out
of
the
window
with
the
torn
shade
as
they
loitered
along
in
front
of
the
place
as
before
much
to
their
surprise
not
ten
minutes
had
passed
when
the
child
stole
forth
we
were
just
in
time
breathed
florence
dressed
just
as
she
was
on
the
first
night
i
saw
her
lucile
whispered
as
the
child
passed
them
she
making
for
the
elevated
station
this
time
said
florence
as
they
hurried
along
after
her
that
means
a
long
trip
and
you
are
tired
why
do
you
let
me
follow
her
alone
why
i
lucile
cut
her
speech
short
to
grip
her
companion
arm
florence
she
whispered
excitedly
did
you
hear
a
footstep
behind
us
why
yes
i
florence
hesitated
lucile
broke
in
there
was
one
i
am
sure
of
it
and
just
now
as
i
looked
about
there
was
no
one
in
sight
you
do
think
someone
could
suspect
be
shadowing
us
of
course
not
it
might
be
that
woman
who
tried
to
carry
the
child
away
i
think
not
that
was
in
another
part
of
the
city
probably
just
nothing
at
all
yes
yes
there
it
is
now
i
hear
it
look
about
quick
no
one
in
sight
said
florence
it
your
nerves
you
better
go
home
and
get
a
good
night
sleep
they
parted
hurriedly
at
the
station
florence
swung
onto
the
train
boarded
by
the
child
a
train
which
she
knew
would
carry
her
to
the
north
side
directly
away
from
the
university
probably
be
morning
before
i
get
in
she
grumbled
to
herself
what
a
wild
chase
yet
as
she
stole
a
glance
now
and
then
at
the
child
who
all
unconscious
of
her
scrutiny
sat
curled
up
in
the
corner
of
a
seat
she
felt
that
after
all
she
was
worth
the
effort
being
made
for
her
whosoever
saveth
a
soul
from
destruction
she
whispered
to
herself
as
the
train
rattled
on
over
the
river
on
its
way
north
in
the
meantime
lucile
had
boarded
a
car
she
was
not
a
little
troubled
by
the
thought
of
those
footsteps
behind
them
on
the
sidewalk
she
knew
it
was
not
her
nerves
someone
following
us
she
whispered
to
herself
i
wonder
who
and
why
she
puzzled
over
it
all
the
way
home
was
puzzling
over
it
still
when
she
left
her
car
at
the
university
somewhat
to
her
surprise
she
saw
harry
brock
leave
the
same
train
he
appeared
almost
to
be
avoiding
her
but
when
she
called
to
him
he
turned
about
and
smiled
so
glad
to
have
someone
to
walk
those
five
lonely
blocks
with
she
smiled
pleasure
mutual
he
murmured
but
he
seemed
ill
at
ease
lucile
glanced
at
him
curiously
he
ca
think
i
got
a
crush
on
him
she
told
herself
our
friendship
had
too
much
of
the
ordinary
in
it
for
that
i
wonder
what
is
the
matter
with
him
conversation
on
the
way
to
the
university
grounds
rambled
along
over
commonplaces
each
studiously
avoided
any
reference
to
the
mystery
of
the
missing
books
lucile
was
distinctly
relieved
as
he
left
her
at
the
dormitory
door
well
she
heaved
a
sigh
whatever
could
have
come
over
him
he
has
always
been
so
frank
and
fine
i
wonder
if
he
suspects
but
no
how
could
he
as
she
hung
her
wrap
in
the
corner
of
her
room
her
eye
fell
upon
the
lunch
box
her
hand
half
reached
for
it
then
she
drew
it
back
and
flung
herself
into
a
chair
she
murmured
i
so
tired
fifteen
minutes
later
she
was
in
her
bed
fast
asleep
dreaming
of
her
pal
and
in
that
dream
she
saw
her
rattling
on
and
on
and
on
forever
through
the
night
chapter
vii
the
vanishing
portland
chart
florence
was
not
rattling
on
and
on
through
the
night
as
lucile
dreamed
some
two
miles
from
the
heart
of
the
city
her
journey
on
the
elevated
came
to
a
halt
the
child
left
the
car
and
went
bounding
down
the
steps
not
many
moments
passed
before
florence
realized
that
her
destination
was
a
famous
library
the
newburg
before
she
knew
it
the
massive
structure
of
gray
sandstone
loomed
up
before
her
and
before
she
could
realize
what
was
happening
the
child
had
darted
through
the
door
and
lost
herself
in
the
labyrinth
of
halls
stairways
and
passageways
which
led
to
hundreds
of
rooms
where
books
were
stacked
or
where
huge
oak
tables
invited
one
to
pause
and
read
she
gone
florence
gasped
now
how
shall
i
find
her
walking
with
all
the
speed
that
proper
conduct
in
such
a
spacious
and
dignified
hostelry
of
books
would
allow
she
passed
from
room
to
room
from
floor
to
floor
until
footsore
and
weary
without
the
least
notion
of
the
kind
of
room
she
was
in
or
whether
she
was
welcome
or
not
she
at
last
threw
herself
into
a
chair
to
rest
she
escaped
me
she
sighed
and
i
promised
to
keep
in
touch
with
her
what
a
mess
but
the
child
a
witch
who
could
be
expected
to
keep
up
with
her
are
you
interested
in
the
exhibit
it
was
the
tone
of
a
trained
librarian
that
interrupted
her
train
of
thought
the
question
startled
her
the
er
she
stammered
why
yes
very
much
what
the
exhibit
might
be
she
had
not
the
remotest
notion
ah
yes
the
lady
sighed
portland
charts
are
indeed
interesting
perhaps
you
should
like
to
have
me
explain
some
of
them
to
you
portland
charts
that
did
sound
interesting
it
suggested
travel
if
there
was
any
one
thing
florence
was
interested
in
it
was
travel
why
yes
she
said
eagerly
i
would
the
most
ancient
ones
said
the
librarian
indicating
a
glass
case
are
here
here
you
see
one
that
was
made
in
some
time
before
columbus
sailed
for
america
these
maps
were
made
for
mariners
certain
men
took
it
up
as
a
life
work
the
making
of
portland
charts
it
is
really
very
wonderful
when
you
think
of
it
how
old
they
are
four
or
five
hundred
years
yet
the
coloring
is
as
perfect
as
if
they
were
done
but
yesterday
florence
listened
eagerly
this
was
indeed
interesting
you
see
smiled
the
librarian
in
those
days
nothing
much
was
known
of
what
is
now
the
new
world
but
from
time
to
time
ships
lost
at
sea
drifted
about
to
land
at
last
on
strange
shores
these
they
supposed
were
shores
of
islands
when
they
returned
they
related
their
experiences
and
a
new
island
was
stuck
somewhere
on
the
map
the
exact
location
could
not
be
discovered
so
they
might
make
a
mistake
of
a
thousand
or
more
miles
in
locating
them
but
that
did
really
matter
for
no
one
ever
went
to
them
again
what
a
time
to
dream
of
sighed
florence
what
an
age
of
mysteries
yes
was
it
but
there
are
mysteries
quite
as
wonderful
only
trouble
is
we
do
see
them
and
sometimes
we
do
see
them
but
ca
solve
them
florence
was
thinking
of
the
mystery
that
thus
far
was
her
property
and
her
chum
the
maps
were
sometimes
bound
in
thin
books
very
much
like
an
atlas
the
librarian
explained
here
is
one
that
is
very
rare
she
indicated
a
book
in
a
case
the
book
was
open
at
the
first
map
with
the
inside
of
the
front
cover
showing
florence
was
about
to
pass
it
with
a
glance
when
something
in
the
upper
outside
corner
of
the
cover
caught
and
held
her
attention
it
was
the
picture
of
a
gargoyle
with
a
letter
l
surrounding
two
sides
of
it
it
was
a
bookmark
and
though
she
had
not
seen
the
mark
in
the
missing
shakespeare
she
knew
from
lucile
description
of
it
that
this
must
be
an
exact
duplicate
probably
from
the
same
library
originally
she
thought
i
suppose
these
charts
are
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
she
ventured
oh
yes
a
great
deal
one
does
really
set
a
price
on
such
things
these
were
the
gift
of
a
rich
man
it
is
the
finest
collection
except
one
in
america
as
florence
turned
to
pass
on
she
was
startled
to
see
the
mysterious
child
who
had
escaped
from
her
sight
nearly
an
hour
before
standing
not
ten
feet
from
her
she
was
apparently
much
interested
in
the
cherubs
done
in
blue
ink
on
one
chart
and
used
to
indicate
the
prevailing
direction
of
the
winds
ah
now
i
have
you
she
sighed
there
is
but
one
door
to
this
room
i
will
watch
the
door
not
you
when
you
leave
the
room
i
will
follow
with
the
corner
of
an
eye
on
that
door
she
sauntered
from
case
to
case
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
then
seized
with
a
sudden
desire
to
examine
the
chart
book
with
the
gargoyle
in
the
corner
of
its
cover
she
drifted
toward
it
scarcely
could
she
believe
her
eyes
as
she
gave
the
case
a
glance
chart
book
was
consternation
seized
her
she
was
about
to
cry
out
when
the
thought
suddenly
came
to
her
that
the
book
had
probably
been
removed
by
the
librarian
the
next
moment
a
suggestion
that
the
ancient
map
book
and
the
presence
of
the
child
in
the
room
had
some
definite
connection
flashed
through
her
mind
hurriedly
her
eye
swept
the
room
the
child
was
gone
there
remained
now
not
one
particle
of
doubt
in
her
mind
she
took
it
she
whispered
i
wonder
why
instantly
her
mind
was
in
a
commotion
should
she
tell
what
she
knew
at
first
she
thought
she
ought
yet
deliberation
led
to
silence
for
after
all
what
did
she
know
she
had
not
seen
the
child
take
the
book
she
had
seen
her
in
the
room
that
was
all
and
now
the
librarian
sauntering
past
the
case
noted
the
loss
the
color
left
her
face
but
that
was
all
if
anything
her
actions
were
more
deliberate
than
before
gliding
to
a
desk
she
pressed
a
button
the
next
moment
a
man
appeared
she
spoke
a
few
words
her
tone
was
low
her
lips
steady
the
man
sauntered
by
the
case
glanced
about
the
room
then
walked
out
of
the
door
not
a
word
not
an
outcry
a
book
worth
thousands
had
vanished
yet
as
she
left
the
library
florence
felt
how
impossible
it
would
have
been
for
her
to
have
carried
that
book
with
her
she
passed
four
men
before
she
reached
the
outside
door
and
each
one
searched
her
from
head
to
foot
quite
as
thoroughly
as
an
might
have
done
all
the
same
she
breathed
as
she
reached
the
cool
damp
outer
air
of
night
the
bird
has
flown
your
portland
chart
book
is
gone
for
the
time
at
least
question
is
she
told
herself
what
am
i
going
to
do
about
it
chapter
viii
what
was
in
the
lunch
box
we
can
tell
whether
she
really
took
it
said
lucile
after
listening
to
florence
story
of
her
strange
experiences
in
the
portland
chart
room
of
the
famous
old
library
we
go
back
to
tyler
street
and
look
in
at
the
window
with
the
torn
shade
if
she
took
it
it
sure
to
be
in
the
empty
space
in
the
looks
like
he
was
trying
to
fill
that
space
he
awfully
particular
about
how
it
filled
laughed
florence
he
might
pick
up
enough
old
books
in
a
secondhand
store
to
fill
the
whole
space
and
not
spend
more
than
a
dollar
is
it
strange
mused
lucile
he
might
pack
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
old
books
in
a
space
two
feet
long
and
will
at
the
rate
he
going
the
greatest
mystery
after
all
is
the
gargoyle
in
the
corner
of
each
book
they
take
said
florence
wrinkling
her
brow
he
seems
to
be
sort
of
specializing
in
those
books
they
are
taken
probably
from
a
private
library
that
has
been
sold
and
scattered
that
is
strange
said
lucile
the
whole
affair
is
most
mysterious
and
by
the
way
she
smiled
i
have
never
taken
the
trouble
to
look
into
that
lunch
box
the
child
lost
on
the
street
the
night
we
rescued
her
from
that
strange
and
terrible
woman
there
might
possibly
be
some
clue
in
it
might
agreed
florence
now
that
the
thought
had
occurred
to
them
they
were
eager
to
inspect
the
box
lucile
fingers
trembled
as
they
unloosed
the
clasps
which
held
it
shut
and
well
they
might
have
trembled
for
as
it
was
thrown
open
it
revealed
a
small
book
done
in
a
temporary
binding
of
vellum
lucile
gave
it
one
glance
then
with
a
little
cry
of
surprise
dropped
it
as
if
it
were
on
fire
why
why
what
exclaimed
florence
in
astonishment
it
frank
morrow
book
walton
angler
the
first
edition
the
one
worth
sixteen
hundred
dollars
and
it
been
right
here
in
this
room
all
the
time
lucile
sank
into
a
chair
and
there
sat
staring
at
the
strangely
found
book
is
that
queer
said
florence
at
last
she
she
been
to
his
shop
got
into
the
building
just
the
way
you
said
she
would
by
posing
as
a
scrubwoman
child
and
had
made
a
safe
escape
when
that
woman
for
some
mysterious
reason
grabbed
her
and
tried
to
carry
her
off
looks
that
way
said
florence
and
i
guess
that
a
clear
enough
case
against
her
if
our
shakespeare
one
is
you
tell
frank
morrow
and
he
have
her
arrested
of
course
i
i
do
know
hesitated
lucile
i
really
no
surer
that
that
the
thing
to
do
than
i
was
before
there
is
something
so
very
strange
about
it
all
the
book
fell
open
in
her
hand
the
inside
of
the
front
cover
was
exposed
to
view
the
gargoyle
in
the
corner
stared
up
at
her
it
the
gargoyle
she
exclaimed
why
always
the
gargoyle
and
how
could
a
child
with
a
face
like
hers
consciously
commit
a
theft
for
a
time
they
sat
silently
staring
at
the
gargoyle
at
last
lucile
spoke
i
think
i
go
and
talk
with
frank
morrow
will
you
tell
him
all
about
it
i
i
do
know
florence
looked
puzzled
are
you
going
to
take
the
book
lucile
hesitated
no
she
said
after
a
moment
thought
i
think
i
why
what
florence
paused
took
one
look
at
her
roommate
face
then
went
about
the
business
of
gathering
up
material
for
a
class
lecture
sometimes
she
said
after
a
moment
i
think
you
are
as
big
a
riddle
as
the
mystery
you
are
trying
to
solve
why
lucile
exclaimed
i
am
only
trying
to
treat
everyone
fairly
which
ca
be
done
laughed
florence
there
is
an
old
proverb
which
runs
like
this
do
right
by
all
men
is
an
art
which
no
one
knows
lucile
approached
the
shop
of
frank
morrow
in
a
troubled
state
of
mind
she
had
frank
morrow
valuable
book
she
wished
to
play
fair
with
him
she
must
sooner
or
later
return
it
to
him
perhaps
even
at
this
moment
he
might
have
a
customer
for
the
book
time
lost
might
mean
a
sale
lost
yet
she
did
not
wish
to
return
it
not
at
this
time
she
did
not
wish
even
so
much
as
to
admit
that
she
had
the
book
in
her
possession
to
do
so
would
be
to
put
herself
in
a
position
which
required
further
explaining
the
book
had
been
carried
away
from
the
bookshop
probably
it
had
been
stolen
had
she
herself
taken
it
if
not
who
then
where
was
the
culprit
why
should
not
such
a
person
be
punished
these
were
some
of
the
questions
she
imagined
frank
morrow
asking
her
and
for
the
present
she
did
not
wish
to
answer
them
at
last
just
as
the
elevator
mounted
toward
the
upper
floors
she
thought
she
saw
a
way
out
anyway
i
try
it
she
told
herself
she
found
frank
morrow
alone
in
his
shop
he
glanced
up
at
her
from
over
an
ancient
volume
he
had
been
scanning
then
rose
to
bid
her
welcome
well
what
will
it
be
he
smiled
a
folio
edition
of
shakespeare
or
only
the
original
manuscript
of
one
of
his
plays
oh
she
smiled
back
are
there
really
original
manuscripts
of
shakespeare
plays
not
that
anyone
has
ever
discovered
but
my
young
lady
if
you
chance
to
come
across
one
i
pledge
to
sell
it
for
you
for
a
million
dollars
flat
and
not
charge
you
a
cent
commission
oh
breathed
lucile
that
would
be
marvelous
then
suddenly
she
remembered
her
reason
for
being
there
please
may
i
take
a
chair
she
asked
her
lips
aquiver
with
some
new
excitement
by
all
means
frank
morrow
himself
sank
into
a
chair
morrow
said
lucile
poising
on
the
very
edge
of
the
chair
while
she
clasped
and
unclasped
her
hands
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
i
know
exactly
where
your
book
is
the
one
worth
sixteen
hundred
dollars
the
compleat
angler
what
would
you
say
frank
morrow
let
a
paperweight
he
had
been
toying
with
crash
down
upon
the
top
of
his
desk
yet
as
he
turned
to
look
at
her
there
was
no
emotion
expressed
upon
his
face
a
whimsical
smile
that
was
all
i
say
you
were
a
fortunate
girl
you
probably
know
i
offered
a
hundred
dollar
reward
for
its
return
this
morning
i
doubled
that
lucile
breath
came
short
and
quick
she
had
completely
forgotten
the
reward
she
would
be
justly
entitled
to
it
and
what
would
two
hundred
dollars
mean
to
her
clothes
she
had
longed
for
but
could
not
afford
leisure
for
more
complete
devotion
to
her
studies
all
this
and
much
more
could
be
purchased
with
two
hundred
dollars
for
a
moment
she
wavered
what
was
the
use
the
whole
proposition
if
put
fairly
to
the
average
person
she
knew
would
sound
absurd
to
protect
two
persons
whom
you
have
never
met
nor
even
spoken
to
to
protect
them
when
to
all
appearances
they
were
committing
one
theft
after
another
with
no
excuse
which
at
the
moment
might
be
discovered
how
ridiculous
yet
even
as
she
wavered
she
saw
again
the
face
of
that
child
heard
again
the
shuffling
footstep
of
the
tottering
old
man
thought
of
the
gargoyle
mystery
then
resolved
to
stand
her
ground
i
do
know
exactly
where
your
book
is
she
said
steadily
but
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
for
the
present
i
did
not
wish
to
have
you
ask
me
where
it
was
what
would
you
say
why
he
smiled
as
before
i
would
say
that
this
was
a
great
old
world
full
of
many
mysteries
that
have
never
been
solved
i
should
say
that
a
mere
book
was
nothing
to
stand
between
good
friends
he
put
out
a
hand
to
clasp
hers
when
you
wish
to
tell
me
where
the
book
is
or
to
see
that
it
is
returned
drop
in
or
call
me
on
the
phone
the
reward
will
be
waiting
for
you
lucile
face
was
flushed
as
she
rose
to
go
she
wished
to
tell
him
all
yet
did
not
dare
but
but
you
might
have
a
customer
waiting
for
that
book
she
exclaimed
one
might
he
smiled
in
such
an
event
i
should
say
that
the
customer
would
be
obliged
to
continue
to
wait
lucile
moved
toward
the
door
and
as
she
did
so
she
barely
missed
bumping
into
an
immaculately
tailored
young
man
with
all
too
pink
cheeks
and
a
budding
moustache
i
beg
your
pardon
he
apologized
it
was
my
fault
said
lucile
much
confused
the
young
man
turned
to
frank
morrow
show
up
yet
he
asked
not
yet
well
i
let
you
know
if
it
does
yes
do
i
have
a
notion
i
know
where
there
another
copy
well
i
be
sorry
to
lose
the
sale
but
i
ca
promise
delivery
at
any
known
date
now
perhaps
not
at
all
perhaps
the
young
man
bowed
his
way
out
so
quickly
that
lucile
was
still
in
the
shop
that
smiled
frank
morrow
is
stanley
ramsey
a
son
of
one
of
our
richest
men
he
wanted
compleat
angler
he
turned
to
his
work
as
if
he
had
been
speaking
of
a
mere
trifle
lucile
was
overwhelmed
so
he
did
have
a
customer
who
was
impatient
of
waiting
and
might
seek
a
copy
elsewhere
why
this
frank
morrow
was
a
real
sport
she
found
herself
wanting
more
than
ever
to
tell
him
everything
and
to
assure
him
that
the
book
would
be
on
his
desk
in
two
hours
time
she
considered
but
again
the
face
of
the
child
framed
in
a
circle
of
light
came
before
her
again
on
the
street
at
night
in
the
clutches
of
a
vile
woman
she
heard
her
say
i
wo
steal
i
die
first
then
with
a
sigh
she
tiptoed
toward
the
door
by
the
way
frank
morrow
voice
startled
her
you
live
over
at
the
university
do
you
yes
mind
doing
me
a
favor
certainly
not
the
binderies
are
only
two
blocks
from
your
station
you
almost
pass
them
they
bind
books
by
hand
fine
books
you
know
i
have
two
very
valuable
books
which
must
be
bound
in
leather
i
hate
to
trust
them
to
an
ordinary
messenger
and
i
ca
take
them
myself
would
you
mind
taking
them
along
n
no
lucile
was
all
but
overcome
by
this
token
of
his
confidence
in
her
thanks
he
wrapped
the
two
books
carefully
and
handed
them
to
her
adding
as
he
did
so
ask
for
silver
himself
and
do
let
anyone
else
have
them
perhaps
he
suggested
as
an
afterthought
you
like
to
be
shown
through
the
bindery
it
rather
an
interesting
place
indeed
i
should
anything
that
has
to
do
with
books
interests
me
he
scribbled
a
note
on
a
bit
of
paper
that
let
you
through
he
smiled
and
no
thanks
due
good
turn
you
know
he
bowed
her
out
of
the
room
she
found
silver
to
be
a
brisk
person
with
a
polite
and
obliging
manner
it
was
with
a
deep
sense
of
relief
that
she
saw
the
books
safely
in
his
hands
she
had
seen
so
much
of
vanishing
books
these
last
few
days
that
she
feared
some
strange
magic
trick
might
spirit
them
from
her
before
they
reached
their
destination
the
note
requesting
that
she
be
taken
through
the
bindery
she
kept
for
another
time
she
must
hurry
back
to
the
university
now
it
will
be
a
real
treat
she
told
herself
there
are
few
really
famous
binderies
in
our
country
and
this
is
one
of
them
little
she
realized
as
she
left
the
long
low
building
which
housed
the
bindery
what
part
it
was
destined
to
play
in
the
mystery
she
was
attempting
to
unravel
she
returned
to
the
university
and
to
her
studies
that
night
she
and
florence
went
once
more
to
tyler
street
to
the
cottage
where
the
two
mysterious
persons
lived
and
there
the
skein
of
mystery
was
thrown
into
a
new
tangle
chapter
ix
shadowed
a
cold
fog
hung
low
over
the
city
as
the
two
girls
stole
forth
from
the
elevated
station
that
night
on
their
way
to
tyler
street
from
the
trestlework
of
the
elevated
there
came
a
steady
the
streets
reeked
with
damp
and
chill
the
electric
lamps
seemed
but
balls
of
light
suspended
in
space
said
florence
drawing
her
wraps
more
closely
about
her
what
a
night
sh
whispered
lucile
dragging
her
into
a
corner
there
someone
following
us
again
scarcely
had
she
spoken
the
words
when
a
man
with
collar
turned
up
and
cap
pulled
low
passed
within
four
feet
of
them
he
traveled
with
a
long
swinging
stride
lucile
fancied
that
she
recognized
that
stride
but
she
could
not
be
sure
also
for
the
moment
she
could
not
remember
who
the
person
was
who
walked
in
this
fashion
only
some
man
returning
to
his
home
said
florence
this
place
gets
on
your
nerves
perhaps
said
lucile
as
they
reached
the
street
before
the
cottage
of
many
mysteries
they
were
pleased
to
see
lights
streaming
from
the
rent
in
the
shade
at
least
we
shall
be
able
to
tell
whether
they
have
the
book
of
portland
charts
sighed
lucile
as
she
prepared
to
make
a
dash
for
the
shadows
now
she
breathed
there
no
one
in
sight
like
two
drifts
of
fog
they
glided
into
a
place
by
the
window
lucile
was
first
to
look
the
place
seemed
quite
familiar
to
her
indeed
at
first
glance
she
would
have
said
that
nothing
was
changed
the
old
man
sat
in
his
chair
half
in
a
doze
he
had
doubtless
drifted
into
the
sort
of
that
old
persons
often
indulge
in
the
child
too
sat
by
the
table
she
was
sewing
that
she
meant
to
go
out
later
was
proved
by
the
fact
that
her
coat
and
lay
on
a
chair
as
i
have
said
lucile
first
thought
was
that
nothing
had
changed
one
difference
however
did
not
escape
her
two
books
had
been
added
to
the
library
the
narrow
unfilled
space
had
been
narrowed
still
further
one
book
was
tall
too
tall
for
the
space
which
it
was
supposed
to
occupy
so
tall
that
it
leaned
a
little
to
the
right
the
other
book
did
not
appear
to
be
an
old
volume
on
the
contrary
its
back
was
bright
and
shiny
as
if
just
coming
from
the
press
it
was
highly
ornamented
with
figures
and
a
title
done
all
in
gold
these
fairly
flashed
in
the
lamplight
that
strange
she
whispered
to
herself
but
even
as
she
thought
it
she
realized
that
this
was
no
ordinary
publishers
binding
leather
she
told
herself
rich
leather
binding
and
i
should
wonder
if
the
letters
and
decorations
were
done
in
pure
gold
without
knowing
exactly
why
she
did
it
she
made
a
mental
note
of
every
figure
which
played
a
part
in
the
decorating
of
the
back
of
that
book
then
suddenly
remembering
her
companion
and
their
problem
she
touched
her
arm
as
she
whispered
look
is
that
tall
book
second
from
the
end
on
the
shelf
with
the
vacant
space
the
portland
chart
book
florence
pressed
her
face
to
the
glass
and
peered
for
the
first
time
into
the
room
of
mysteries
for
a
full
two
minutes
she
allowed
the
scene
to
be
photographed
on
the
sensitive
plates
of
her
brain
then
turning
slowly
away
she
whispered
yes
i
believe
it
is
they
were
just
thinking
of
seeking
a
place
of
greater
safety
when
a
footstep
sounded
on
the
pavement
close
at
hand
crouching
low
they
waited
the
stranger
passing
to
their
consternation
he
did
not
pass
but
turned
in
at
the
short
walk
which
led
up
to
the
cottage
crouching
still
lower
scarcely
breathing
they
waited
the
man
made
his
way
directly
to
the
door
after
apparently
fumbling
about
for
an
electric
button
he
suddenly
flashed
out
an
electric
torch
with
an
inaudible
gasp
florence
prepared
to
drag
her
companion
out
of
their
place
of
danger
but
to
their
intense
relief
the
man
flashed
the
light
off
then
gave
the
door
a
resounding
knock
that
one
flash
of
light
had
been
sufficient
to
reveal
to
lucile
the
features
of
his
face
she
recognized
it
instantly
in
her
surprise
she
gripped
her
companion
arm
until
she
was
ready
to
cry
out
with
pain
the
door
flew
open
the
man
entered
the
door
was
closed
look
whispered
lucile
pressing
florence
toward
the
spot
where
the
light
streamed
out
look
i
know
him
she
gave
florence
but
a
half
moment
then
dragging
her
from
the
place
of
vantage
pressed
her
own
face
to
the
glass
this
would
be
abominable
she
whispered
if
it
were
for
the
fact
that
we
are
trying
to
help
them
trying
to
find
a
way
out
the
man
a
very
young
man
with
a
slight
moustache
had
removed
his
coat
and
hat
and
had
taken
a
seat
he
was
talking
to
the
old
man
he
did
the
greater
part
of
the
talking
every
now
and
again
he
would
pause
and
the
old
man
would
shake
his
head
this
pantomime
was
kept
up
for
some
time
at
last
the
young
man
rose
and
walked
toward
the
bookshelves
the
old
man
half
rose
in
his
chair
as
if
to
detain
him
then
settled
back
again
the
young
man
eyes
roved
over
the
books
then
came
to
rest
suddenly
in
a
certain
spot
then
his
hand
went
out
the
old
man
sprang
to
his
feet
there
were
words
on
his
lips
what
they
were
the
girls
could
not
tell
smiling
with
the
grace
of
one
who
is
accustomed
to
have
what
he
desires
the
young
man
opened
the
book
to
glance
at
the
title
page
at
once
his
face
became
eager
he
glanced
hurriedly
through
the
book
he
turned
to
put
a
question
to
the
old
man
beside
him
the
old
man
nodded
instantly
the
young
man
hand
was
in
his
pocket
the
two
girls
shrank
back
in
fear
but
the
thing
he
took
from
his
pocket
was
a
small
book
apparently
a
check
book
speaking
he
held
the
check
book
toward
the
old
man
the
old
man
shook
his
head
this
touch
of
drama
was
repeated
three
times
then
with
a
disappointed
look
on
his
face
the
young
man
replaced
the
book
turned
to
the
chair
on
which
his
hat
and
coat
rested
put
them
on
said
good
night
to
the
old
man
bowed
to
the
child
and
was
gone
the
two
girls
after
stretching
their
cramped
limbs
made
their
way
safely
to
the
sidewalk
who
who
was
he
whispered
florence
through
chattering
teeth
stanley
ramsey
not
the
rich
ramsey
his
son
what
did
he
want
i
do
know
said
lucile
but
it
may
be
that
we
have
found
the
man
higher
up
the
real
criminal
it
may
be
that
this
rich
young
fellow
is
getting
them
to
steal
the
books
so
he
can
buy
them
cheap
lucile
told
of
the
incident
regarding
the
copy
of
the
compleat
angler
he
said
he
thought
he
knew
where
there
was
another
copy
do
you
see
he
may
have
gotten
the
girl
to
steal
it
and
now
he
comes
for
it
and
is
disappointed
because
they
have
got
it
for
him
it
might
be
said
florence
doubtfully
but
it
does
seem
probable
does
it
he
must
have
plenty
of
money
perhaps
his
father
does
give
him
a
large
allowance
then
again
perhaps
he
thinks
such
things
are
smart
they
say
that
some
rich
sons
are
that
way
there
something
that
happened
in
there
though
that
i
do
understand
he
hist
whispered
florence
dragging
her
into
a
slow
walk
here
comes
the
child
once
more
they
saw
the
slim
wisp
of
a
girl
steal
out
like
a
ghost
into
the
night
chapter
x
mysteries
of
the
sea
the
trail
over
which
the
mystery
child
led
them
that
night
revealed
nothing
indeed
she
eluded
them
escaping
the
moment
she
left
the
elevated
train
at
a
down
town
station
nothing
to
do
but
go
home
said
florence
in
a
disappointed
tone
oh
well
cheer
up
smiled
lucile
we
had
a
new
chapter
added
to
our
mystery
as
well
as
a
whole
new
character
who
promises
to
become
interesting
but
look
florence
she
whispered
suddenly
no
stare
just
glance
down
toward
the
end
of
the
platform
see
that
man
the
one
with
his
collar
turned
up
and
with
his
back
to
us
yes
that
the
man
who
passed
us
when
we
were
on
our
way
to
the
mystery
cottage
are
you
sure
ca
be
mistaken
same
coat
same
hat
same
everything
why
then
florence
checked
herself
a
moment
later
she
said
in
a
quiet
tone
of
voice
lucile
do
you
think
it
about
time
we
waded
ashore
came
clear
and
got
out
of
this
affair
turned
facts
over
to
the
authorities
and
allowed
them
to
take
their
course
lucile
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
she
shivered
all
over
and
whispered
tensely
no
no
not
quite
yet
we
may
get
in
over
our
necks
i
can
swim
ca
you
i
try
florence
laughed
and
there
for
the
time
the
matter
ended
lucile
worked
in
the
library
two
hours
the
next
day
one
fact
could
not
escape
her
attention
harry
brock
had
been
losing
a
lot
of
sleep
she
saw
him
rubbing
his
eyes
from
time
to
time
and
once
he
actually
nodded
over
his
records
been
studying
late
she
asked
in
friendly
sympathy
he
shot
her
a
quick
penetrating
glance
then
seeming
to
catch
himself
said
oh
yes
quite
a
bit
that
afternoon
finding
study
difficult
and
being
in
need
of
a
theme
for
a
special
article
to
be
written
for
english
she
decided
to
use
her
card
of
admittance
to
the
bindery
and
glean
the
material
for
the
theme
from
that
institution
she
could
scarcely
have
chosen
a
more
fitting
subject
for
there
are
few
places
more
interesting
than
a
famous
book
bindery
unfortunately
something
occurred
while
she
was
there
that
quite
drove
all
the
thoughts
of
her
theme
out
of
her
head
and
added
to
her
already
shoulders
an
increased
weight
of
responsibility
a
famous
bindery
is
a
place
of
many
wonders
the
stitching
machines
the
little
and
great
presses
the
glowing
fires
that
heat
irons
for
the
stamping
all
these
and
many
more
lend
an
air
of
industry
mystery
and
fine
endeavor
to
the
place
not
in
the
general
bindery
where
thousands
of
books
are
bound
each
day
did
lucile
find
her
chief
interest
however
it
was
when
she
had
been
shown
into
a
small
side
room
into
which
the
natural
sunlight
shone
through
a
broad
window
that
she
realized
that
she
had
reached
the
heart
of
the
place
this
said
the
young
man
attending
her
is
the
hand
bindery
few
books
are
bound
here
sometimes
not
more
than
six
a
year
but
they
are
handsomely
wonderfully
bound
kirkland
the
head
of
this
department
will
tell
you
all
about
it
i
hear
my
autophone
call
i
will
come
for
you
a
little
later
lucile
was
not
sorry
to
be
left
alone
in
such
a
room
it
was
a
place
of
rare
enchantment
seated
at
their
benches
bending
over
their
work
with
their
blue
fires
burning
before
them
were
three
skilled
workmen
they
were
more
than
workmen
they
were
artists
the
work
turned
out
by
them
rivaled
in
beauty
and
perfection
the
canvas
of
the
most
skilled
painter
they
wrought
in
inlaid
leather
and
gold
the
artist
in
crayon
and
oils
the
artist
uses
palette
knife
and
brush
their
steel
tools
were
fashioned
to
suit
their
art
ranged
along
one
side
of
the
room
was
a
long
rack
in
which
these
tools
were
kept
there
were
hundreds
of
them
and
each
tool
had
its
place
every
now
and
again
from
the
benches
there
came
a
hot
sizzling
sound
which
meant
that
one
of
these
tools
was
being
tested
after
having
been
heated
over
the
flame
seeing
her
looking
at
the
rack
of
tools
the
head
workman
a
man
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
keen
blue
eyes
turned
toward
her
would
you
like
to
have
me
tell
you
a
little
about
them
he
asked
indeed
i
should
those
tools
once
belonged
to
hans
wiemar
the
most
famous
man
ever
known
to
the
craft
after
he
died
i
bought
them
from
his
widow
he
once
spent
three
years
binding
a
single
book
it
was
to
be
presented
to
the
king
of
england
he
was
a
very
skillful
artisan
we
bind
some
pretty
fine
books
here
too
he
said
modestly
here
is
one
i
am
only
just
beginning
you
see
it
is
a
very
large
book
a
book
of
poetry
printed
in
the
original
german
i
shall
be
at
least
two
months
doing
it
the
last
one
i
had
was
much
smaller
but
it
was
to
have
taken
me
four
months
a
shadow
passed
over
his
face
did
did
you
finish
it
asked
lucile
a
tone
of
instinctive
sympathy
in
her
voice
it
was
an
ancient
french
book
done
in
the
oldest
french
type
it
was
called
of
the
sea
he
went
on
without
answering
her
question
this
was
the
tool
we
used
most
on
it
he
said
holding
out
the
edge
of
a
steel
tool
for
her
inspection
you
see
the
metal
is
heated
and
pressed
into
the
leather
in
just
the
right
way
then
gold
carat
gold
is
pressed
into
the
creases
that
are
left
and
we
have
a
figure
in
gold
as
a
result
this
one
you
see
is
in
the
form
of
an
ancient
sailing
ship
lucile
started
then
examined
the
tool
more
carefully
here
is
another
tool
we
used
it
represents
clouds
this
one
makes
the
water
you
see
we
use
appropriate
tools
the
book
was
about
ships
and
the
sea
written
before
the
time
of
columbus
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
said
slowly
a
look
of
pain
coming
into
his
fine
face
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
tell
you
the
book
was
stolen
stolen
from
my
bench
during
the
lunch
hour
lucile
started
violently
the
artist
stared
at
her
for
a
second
then
went
on
of
course
i
ca
be
held
responsible
yet
no
doubt
they
blame
me
in
a
way
the
book
was
very
valuable
worth
thousands
of
dollars
and
it
would
have
been
finished
in
two
days
he
bowed
his
head
as
if
in
silent
grief
please
lucile
lips
quivered
with
emotion
as
she
spoke
did
the
book
have
three
of
these
ancient
ship
designs
on
the
back
of
it
one
large
and
two
small
yes
and
was
it
done
in
dark
red
leather
with
the
decorations
all
in
gold
yes
yes
the
man
tones
were
eager
and
and
lucile
whispered
the
words
was
there
a
bookmark
in
the
upper
corner
of
the
inside
of
the
front
cover
yes
yes
yes
he
uttered
the
words
in
a
tense
whisper
how
can
you
know
so
much
about
the
book
please
pleaded
lucile
i
ca
tell
you
now
but
per
perhaps
i
can
help
you
i
will
take
you
to
our
president
to
mr
silver
please
please
no
not
now
please
let
me
go
now
i
must
think
i
will
come
back
truly
truly
i
will
with
the
instinct
of
a
born
gentleman
he
escorted
her
to
a
side
door
and
let
her
out
the
sunshine
as
she
emerged
seemed
unreal
to
her
everything
seemed
unreal
the
gargoyle
the
gargoyle
she
whispered
hoarsely
can
i
never
escape
it
can
i
go
no
place
without
discovering
that
books
marked
with
that
hated
haunting
sign
have
been
stolen
that
book
the
copy
of
of
the
sea
is
the
latest
acquirement
of
the
old
man
in
the
mystery
cottage
on
tyler
street
she
stole
it
the
child
stole
it
and
why
why
it
seems
that
i
should
tell
all
that
i
know
she
whispered
to
herself
that
it
is
my
duty
surely
the
thing
ca
go
on
she
bathed
her
flushed
cheeks
in
the
outer
air
and
yet
she
thought
more
calmly
there
are
the
old
man
the
child
there
something
back
of
it
all
the
gargoyle
secret
oh
if
only
one
knew
chapter
xi
lucile
shares
her
secret
as
lucile
returned
to
her
room
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
being
hedged
about
on
all
sides
by
friends
who
had
a
right
to
demand
that
she
reveal
the
secret
of
the
stolen
books
the
university
which
had
done
so
much
for
her
frank
morrow
her
father
friend
the
great
scientific
library
which
was
a
friend
to
all
and
now
this
splendid
artist
who
worked
in
leather
and
gold
they
all
appeared
to
be
reaching
out
their
hands
to
her
in
her
room
for
two
hours
she
paced
the
floor
then
she
came
to
a
decision
i
tell
one
of
them
tell
the
whole
story
and
leave
it
to
him
who
shall
it
be
the
answer
came
to
her
instantly
frank
morrow
yes
he
the
one
she
whispered
he
the
most
human
of
them
all
as
he
is
i
believe
he
can
understand
the
heart
of
a
child
and
and
of
a
girl
like
me
she
found
him
busy
with
some
customers
when
he
had
completed
the
sale
and
the
customers
had
gone
she
drew
her
chair
close
to
his
and
told
him
the
story
frankly
from
beginning
to
end
the
only
thing
she
left
out
was
the
fact
that
she
held
suspicions
against
the
young
millionaire
son
if
there
ground
for
suspicion
he
discover
it
she
told
herself
frank
morrow
listened
attentively
at
times
he
leaned
forward
with
the
light
on
his
face
that
one
sometimes
sees
upon
the
face
of
a
boy
who
is
hearing
a
good
story
of
pirates
and
the
sea
well
he
dampened
his
lips
as
she
finished
well
for
some
time
after
that
there
was
silence
in
the
room
a
silence
so
profound
that
the
ticking
of
frank
morrow
watch
sounded
loud
as
a
grandfather
clock
at
last
frank
morrow
wheeled
about
in
his
chair
and
spoke
you
know
miss
lucile
he
said
slowly
i
am
no
longer
a
child
except
in
spirit
i
have
read
a
great
deal
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
sitting
alone
in
this
chair
both
by
day
and
by
night
very
often
i
have
thought
of
us
of
the
whole
human
race
of
our
relation
to
the
world
to
the
being
who
created
us
and
to
one
another
i
have
come
to
think
of
life
like
this
he
said
his
eyes
kindling
it
may
seem
a
rather
gloomy
philosophy
of
life
but
when
you
think
of
it
it
a
mighty
friendly
one
i
think
of
the
whole
human
race
as
being
on
a
huge
raft
in
there
food
and
water
enough
for
everyone
if
all
of
us
are
saving
careful
and
kind
not
one
of
us
knows
how
we
came
on
the
raft
no
one
knows
whither
we
are
bound
from
time
to
time
we
hear
the
distant
waves
break
on
some
shore
but
what
shore
we
can
not
tell
the
earth
of
course
is
our
raft
and
the
rest
of
the
universe
our
sea
what
the
answer
to
all
this
just
this
much
since
we
are
so
situated
the
greatest
best
thing
the
thing
that
will
bring
us
the
greatest
amount
of
real
happiness
is
to
be
kind
to
all
especially
those
weaker
than
ourselves
just
as
we
would
if
we
were
adrift
on
a
raft
in
the
atlantic
without
all
this
philosophy
you
have
caught
the
spirit
of
the
thing
i
ca
advise
you
i
can
only
offer
to
assist
you
in
any
way
you
may
suggest
it
a
strange
case
the
old
man
is
doubtless
a
crank
many
book
collectors
are
it
may
be
however
that
there
is
some
stronger
hand
back
of
it
all
the
girl
appears
to
be
the
old
man
devoted
slave
and
is
too
young
truly
to
understand
right
from
wrong
i
should
say
however
that
she
is
clever
far
beyond
her
years
lucile
left
the
shop
strengthened
and
encouraged
she
had
not
found
a
solution
to
her
problem
but
had
been
told
by
one
much
older
and
wiser
than
she
that
she
was
not
going
at
the
affair
in
the
wrong
way
she
had
received
his
assurance
of
his
assistance
at
any
time
when
it
seemed
needed
that
night
a
strange
thing
happened
lucile
had
learned
by
repeated
experience
that
very
often
the
solution
of
life
perplexing
problems
comes
to
us
when
we
are
farthest
from
them
and
engaged
in
work
or
pursuit
of
pleasure
which
is
most
remote
from
them
someone
had
given
her
a
ticket
to
the
opera
being
a
lover
of
music
she
had
decided
to
abandon
her
work
and
the
pursuit
of
the
mystery
to
forget
herself
listening
to
outbursts
of
enchanting
song
the
outcome
had
been
all
that
she
might
hope
for
lost
in
the
great
swells
of
music
which
came
to
her
from
hundreds
of
voices
or
enchanted
by
the
range
and
beauty
of
a
single
voice
she
forgot
all
until
the
last
curtain
had
been
called
and
the
crowd
thronged
out
there
was
a
flush
on
her
cheek
and
new
light
in
her
eyes
as
she
felt
the
cool
outer
air
of
the
street
she
had
walked
two
blocks
to
her
station
and
was
about
to
mount
the
stairs
when
to
her
utter
astonishment
she
saw
the
mystery
child
dart
across
the
street
almost
by
instinct
she
went
in
full
pursuit
the
child
all
oblivious
of
her
presence
after
crossing
the
street
darted
down
an
alley
and
after
crossing
two
blocks
entered
one
of
those
dark
and
dingy
streets
which
so
often
flank
the
best
and
busiest
avenues
of
a
city
at
the
third
door
to
the
left
a
sort
of
half
basement
entrance
that
one
reached
by
descending
a
short
stairs
the
child
paused
and
fumbled
at
the
doorknob
lucile
was
just
in
time
to
get
a
view
of
the
interior
as
the
door
flew
open
the
next
instant
she
sprang
back
into
the
shadows
she
gripped
at
her
wildly
beating
heart
and
steadied
herself
against
the
wall
as
she
murmured
it
could
be
surely
surely
it
could
not
be
and
yet
she
was
convinced
that
her
eyes
had
not
deceived
her
the
person
who
had
opened
the
door
was
none
other
than
the
woman
who
had
treated
the
child
so
shamefully
and
had
dragged
her
along
the
street
and
now
the
child
had
come
to
the
door
of
the
den
which
this
woman
called
home
and
of
her
own
free
will
had
entered
the
place
and
shut
the
door
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
all
this
some
mysteries
are
long
in
solving
some
are
apparently
never
solved
some
scarcely
become
mysteries
before
their
solution
appears
this
mystery
was
of
the
latter
sort
plucking
up
all
the
courage
she
could
command
lucile
made
her
way
down
the
steps
and
crowding
herself
through
a
narrow
opening
succeeded
in
reaching
a
position
by
a
window
here
she
could
see
without
being
seen
and
could
catch
fragments
of
the
conversation
which
went
on
within
the
child
had
advanced
to
the
center
of
the
room
the
woman
and
a
man
worse
in
appearance
more
degraded
than
the
woman
stood
staring
at
her
there
was
something
heroic
about
the
tense
erect
bearing
of
the
child
like
joan
of
arc
lucile
thought
the
child
was
speaking
the
few
words
that
lucile
caught
sent
thrills
into
her
very
soul
the
child
was
telling
the
woman
that
she
had
had
a
book
which
belonged
to
her
friend
monsieur
le
bon
this
book
was
very
old
and
much
prized
by
him
she
had
had
it
with
her
that
other
night
in
a
lunch
box
the
woman
had
taken
it
she
had
come
for
it
it
must
be
given
back
as
the
child
finished
the
woman
burst
into
a
hoarse
laugh
then
she
launched
forth
in
a
tirade
of
abusive
language
she
did
not
admit
having
the
book
nor
yet
deny
it
she
was
too
intent
upon
abusing
the
child
and
the
old
man
who
had
befriended
her
for
that
at
last
she
sprang
at
the
child
the
child
darted
for
the
door
but
the
man
had
locked
and
bolted
it
there
followed
a
scramble
about
the
room
which
resulted
in
the
upsetting
of
chairs
and
the
knocking
of
kitchen
utensils
from
the
wall
at
last
the
child
now
fighting
and
sobbing
was
roped
to
the
high
post
of
an
ancient
bedstead
then
to
lucile
horror
she
saw
the
man
thrust
a
heavy
iron
poker
through
the
grate
of
the
stove
in
which
a
fire
burned
brightly
her
blood
ran
cold
chills
raced
up
her
spine
what
was
the
purpose
certainly
nothing
good
whatever
these
people
were
to
the
child
whatever
the
child
might
be
the
thing
must
be
stopped
the
child
had
at
least
done
one
heroic
deed
she
had
come
back
for
that
book
the
book
which
at
this
moment
rested
in
lucile
own
room
frank
morrow
book
she
had
come
for
it
knowing
what
she
must
face
and
had
come
not
through
fear
but
through
love
for
her
patriarchal
friend
monsieur
le
bon
somehow
she
must
be
saved
with
a
courage
born
of
despair
lucile
made
her
way
from
the
position
by
the
window
toward
the
door
as
she
did
so
she
thought
she
caught
a
movement
on
the
street
above
her
she
was
sure
that
a
second
later
she
heard
the
sound
of
lightly
running
footsteps
had
she
been
watched
from
above
what
was
to
come
of
that
there
was
no
time
to
form
an
answer
one
hand
was
on
the
knob
with
the
other
she
beat
the
door
the
door
swung
open
she
stepped
inside
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
door
shut
itself
behind
her
for
a
second
her
heart
stood
still
as
she
realized
that
the
man
was
behind
her
that
the
door
was
bolted
chapter
xii
the
trial
by
fire
the
moment
lucile
heard
the
lock
click
behind
her
she
knew
that
she
was
trapped
but
her
fighting
blood
was
up
even
had
the
door
been
wide
open
she
would
not
have
retreated
you
release
that
child
she
said
through
cold
set
lips
yes
you
tell
me
the
child
said
the
woman
with
an
attempt
at
sarcasm
you
who
are
so
brave
who
have
a
companion
who
is
like
an
ox
who
likes
to
beat
up
poor
women
on
the
street
you
say
the
child
you
say
that
and
the
child
she
is
my
own
stepdaughter
i
i
do
believe
it
said
lucile
stoutly
it
is
true
if
it
is
true
you
have
no
right
to
abuse
her
you
are
not
fit
to
be
any
child
mother
not
fit
the
woman
face
became
purple
with
rage
i
am
no
good
she
says
not
fit
she
advanced
threateningly
toward
lucile
now
now
she
stormed
we
have
you
where
we
want
you
now
we
shall
show
you
whether
or
not
we
can
do
as
we
please
with
the
child
that
was
so
very
kindly
given
to
us
she
made
a
move
toward
the
stove
from
which
the
handle
to
the
heavy
poker
protruded
by
this
time
the
end
must
be
red
hot
it
no
use
to
threaten
me
said
lucile
calmly
i
would
leave
the
room
if
i
might
if
i
did
it
would
be
to
bring
an
officer
i
mean
to
see
that
the
child
is
treated
as
a
human
being
and
not
as
a
dog
the
woman
face
once
more
became
purple
she
seemed
petrified
quite
unable
to
move
from
sheer
rage
but
the
man
a
person
with
a
perpetual
leer
in
one
corner
of
his
mouth
started
for
the
stove
with
a
quick
spring
lucile
reached
the
handle
of
the
poker
first
seizing
it
she
drew
it
white
hot
from
the
fire
the
man
sprang
back
in
fear
the
woman
gripped
the
rounds
of
a
heavy
chair
and
made
as
if
to
lift
it
for
a
blow
scarcely
realizing
that
she
was
imitating
her
hero
of
fiction
she
brought
the
glowing
iron
close
to
the
white
and
tender
flesh
of
her
forearm
you
think
you
can
frighten
me
she
smiled
you
think
you
can
do
something
to
me
which
will
cause
me
to
cease
to
attempt
to
protect
that
child
perhaps
you
would
torture
me
i
will
prove
to
you
that
you
can
not
frighten
me
what
i
have
been
doing
is
right
the
world
was
made
for
people
to
live
in
who
do
right
if
one
may
not
always
do
right
then
life
is
not
worth
living
the
fiery
weapon
came
closer
to
her
arm
the
woman
stared
at
her
as
if
fascinated
the
child
who
had
been
silently
struggling
at
her
bands
paused
in
astonishment
for
once
the
leer
on
the
man
lips
vanished
then
of
a
sudden
as
she
appeared
to
catch
the
meaning
of
it
all
the
child
gave
forth
a
piercing
scream
the
next
instant
there
came
a
loud
pounding
at
the
door
as
a
gruff
voice
thundered
here
you
in
there
open
up
the
woman
dropped
upon
the
bed
in
a
real
or
pretended
swoon
lucile
allowed
the
poker
to
drop
to
her
side
with
trembling
fingers
the
man
unloosed
the
door
and
the
next
instant
they
were
looking
into
the
faces
of
a
police
sergeant
and
two
other
officers
of
the
law
what
going
on
here
demanded
the
sergeant
suddenly
recovering
from
her
swoon
the
woman
sprang
to
her
feet
that
young
lady
she
pointed
an
accusing
finger
at
lucile
is
attempting
to
break
up
our
home
the
officer
looked
them
over
one
by
one
what
the
girl
tied
up
for
he
demanded
it
the
only
way
we
can
keep
her
home
said
the
woman
that
young
lady
been
enticing
her
away
her
and
an
old
wretch
of
a
man
your
daughter
my
adopted
daughter
what
about
it
little
one
the
officer
stepped
over
and
cutting
the
girl
bands
placed
a
hand
on
the
child
head
is
what
she
says
true
i
i
do
know
she
faltered
her
knees
trembled
so
she
could
scarcely
stand
i
never
saw
the
young
lady
until
now
but
i
i
think
she
is
wonderful
is
this
woman
your
stepmother
the
girl
hung
her
head
do
you
wish
to
stay
with
her
oh
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
no
no
no
oh
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
the
child
in
her
agony
of
fright
and
grief
threw
herself
face
down
upon
the
bed
the
officer
seating
himself
beside
her
smoothed
her
hair
with
his
huge
right
hand
until
she
was
quiet
then
bit
by
bit
got
from
her
the
story
of
her
experiences
in
this
great
american
city
lucile
listened
eagerly
as
the
little
girl
talked
falteringly
a
belgian
refugee
she
had
been
brought
to
the
united
states
during
the
war
and
because
this
unprincipled
pair
spoke
french
which
she
too
understood
the
but
misguided
people
who
had
her
in
charge
had
given
her
over
to
them
without
fully
looking
up
their
record
because
she
was
small
and
had
an
appealing
face
and
because
she
was
a
refugee
they
had
set
her
to
begging
on
the
street
and
had
more
than
once
asked
her
to
steal
having
been
brought
up
by
conscientious
parents
all
this
was
repulsive
to
her
so
one
day
she
had
run
away
she
had
wandered
the
streets
of
the
great
unfriendly
city
until
almost
at
the
point
of
starvation
she
had
been
taken
home
by
a
very
old
man
a
frenchman
french
she
said
but
not
like
these
she
pointed
a
finger
of
scorn
at
the
man
and
woman
a
french
gentleman
a
very
very
wonderful
man
she
had
lived
with
him
and
had
helped
him
all
she
could
then
one
night
as
she
was
on
an
errand
for
him
the
woman
her
stepmother
had
found
her
she
had
been
seized
and
dragged
along
the
street
but
by
some
strange
chance
she
did
not
at
all
understand
she
had
been
rescued
that
night
she
had
been
carrying
a
book
the
book
belonged
to
her
aged
benefactor
and
was
much
prized
by
him
thinking
that
her
foster
mother
had
the
book
she
had
dared
return
to
ask
for
it
she
proceeded
to
relate
what
had
happened
in
that
room
and
ended
with
a
plea
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
return
to
the
cottage
on
tyler
street
are
you
interested
in
this
child
the
officer
asked
lucile
i
surely
am
want
to
see
that
she
gets
safely
home
i
i
will
and
see
here
the
officer
turned
a
stern
face
on
the
others
if
you
interfere
with
this
child
in
the
future
we
got
enough
on
you
to
put
you
away
you
ai
fit
to
be
no
child
parents
far
as
i
can
tell
this
here
old
man
is
this
case
for
the
present
is
settled
out
of
court
see
he
motioned
to
his
subordinates
they
stood
at
attention
until
lucile
and
the
child
passed
out
then
followed
the
sergeant
saw
the
girl
and
the
child
safely
on
the
elevated
platform
then
tipping
his
hat
mumbled
good
luck
and
thank
y
miss
i
got
two
of
myself
an
if
anything
ever
happened
to
me
i
like
nothin
to
have
you
take
an
interest
in
something
rose
up
in
lucile
throat
and
choked
her
she
could
only
nod
her
thanks
the
next
instant
they
went
rattling
away
bound
for
the
mystery
cottage
on
tyler
street
for
once
lucile
felt
richly
repaid
for
all
the
doubt
perplexity
and
sleepless
hours
she
had
gone
through
it
all
very
strange
and
mysterious
she
told
herself
but
somehow
sometime
it
will
all
come
out
right
as
she
sat
there
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
she
suddenly
became
conscious
of
the
fact
that
the
child
at
her
side
was
silently
weeping
why
she
exclaimed
what
are
you
crying
for
you
are
going
back
to
your
cottage
and
to
your
kind
old
man
the
book
whispered
the
child
it
is
gone
i
can
never
return
it
a
sudden
impulse
seized
lucile
an
impulse
she
could
scarcely
resist
she
wanted
to
take
the
child
in
her
arms
and
say
dear
little
girl
i
have
the
book
in
my
room
i
will
bring
it
to
you
she
did
not
say
it
she
could
not
as
far
as
she
knew
the
old
man
had
no
right
to
the
book
it
belonged
to
frank
morrow
what
she
did
say
was
i
should
worry
any
more
about
it
if
i
were
you
i
am
sure
it
will
come
out
all
right
in
the
end
then
before
they
knew
it
they
were
off
the
elevated
train
and
walking
toward
tyler
street
and
lucile
was
saying
to
herself
i
wonder
what
next
the
two
made
their
way
to
the
door
of
the
dingy
old
cottage
chapter
xiii
in
the
mystery
room
at
night
much
to
her
surprise
just
when
she
had
expected
to
be
trudging
back
to
the
station
alone
lucile
found
herself
seated
by
a
table
in
the
mystery
room
she
was
sipping
a
delicious
cup
of
hot
chocolate
and
talking
to
the
mystery
child
and
her
mysterious
godfather
every
now
and
again
she
paused
to
catch
her
breath
it
was
hard
for
her
to
realize
that
she
was
in
the
mystery
room
of
the
mysterious
cottage
on
tyler
street
yet
there
she
certainly
was
the
child
had
invited
her
in
a
dim
strangely
tinted
light
cast
dark
shadows
over
everything
the
strange
furniture
took
on
grotesque
forms
the
titles
of
the
books
along
the
wall
gleamed
out
in
a
strange
manner
for
a
full
five
minutes
the
child
talked
to
the
old
man
in
french
he
exclaimed
now
and
then
but
other
than
that
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
when
she
had
finished
he
held
out
a
thin
bony
hand
to
lucile
and
said
in
perfect
english
accept
my
thanks
for
what
you
have
done
to
protect
this
poor
little
one
my
pretty
marie
you
are
a
brave
girl
and
should
have
a
reward
but
alas
i
have
little
to
give
save
my
books
and
they
are
an
inheritance
an
inheritance
thrice
removed
they
were
my
and
have
descended
direct
to
me
one
is
loath
to
part
with
such
treasure
there
is
no
need
for
any
reward
said
lucile
quickly
i
did
it
because
i
was
interested
in
the
child
but
with
a
sudden
inspiration
if
you
wish
to
do
me
a
favor
tell
me
the
story
of
your
life
the
man
gave
her
a
quick
look
you
are
so
so
old
she
hastened
to
add
and
so
venerable
so
so
like
general
joffre
your
life
must
have
been
a
wonderful
one
ah
yes
the
old
man
settled
back
in
his
chair
as
if
to
brush
a
mist
from
before
his
eyes
he
made
a
waving
motion
with
his
hand
ah
yes
it
has
been
quite
wonderful
that
is
i
may
say
it
once
was
i
was
born
near
a
little
town
named
gondrecourt
in
the
province
of
meuse
in
france
there
was
a
small
chateau
very
neat
and
beautiful
with
a
garden
behind
it
with
a
bit
of
woods
and
broad
acres
for
cattle
and
grain
all
that
was
my
father
it
afterwards
became
mine
in
one
room
of
the
chateau
were
many
many
ancient
volumes
some
in
french
some
in
english
for
my
father
was
a
scholar
as
also
he
educated
me
to
be
these
books
were
the
cream
of
many
generations
some
dating
back
before
the
time
of
columbus
lucile
thinking
of
the
book
of
ancient
portland
charts
allowed
her
gaze
for
a
second
to
stray
to
the
shelf
where
it
reposed
again
the
man
threw
her
a
questioning
look
but
once
more
went
on
with
his
narrative
of
his
life
in
france
of
all
the
treasures
of
field
garden
woods
or
chateau
the
ones
most
prized
by
me
were
those
ancient
books
so
year
after
year
i
guarded
them
well
guarded
them
until
an
old
man
in
possession
of
all
that
was
once
my
father
i
used
to
sit
of
an
evening
looking
off
at
the
fading
hills
at
eventide
with
one
of
those
books
in
my
lap
then
came
the
war
again
his
hand
went
up
to
dispel
the
imaginary
mist
the
war
took
my
two
sons
they
never
came
back
it
took
my
three
grandsons
we
gave
gladly
for
was
it
not
our
beloved
france
that
was
in
danger
they
too
never
returned
the
old
man
hand
trembled
as
he
brushed
away
the
imaginary
mist
i
borrowed
money
to
give
to
france
i
mortgaged
my
land
my
cattle
my
chateau
only
my
treasure
of
books
i
gave
no
man
a
chance
to
take
they
must
be
mine
until
i
died
they
of
all
the
treasures
i
must
keep
one
night
his
voice
grew
husky
one
night
there
came
a
terrible
explosion
the
earth
rocked
stones
of
the
castle
fell
all
about
the
yard
the
chateau
was
in
ruins
it
was
a
bomb
from
an
airplane
someway
the
library
was
not
touched
it
alone
was
safe
how
thankful
i
was
that
it
was
so
it
was
now
all
that
was
left
i
took
my
library
to
a
small
lodging
in
the
village
then
when
the
war
was
ended
i
packed
all
my
books
in
strong
boxes
and
started
for
paris
he
paused
his
head
sank
upon
his
breast
his
lips
quivered
it
was
as
if
he
were
enduring
over
again
some
great
sorrow
perhaps
he
said
after
a
long
time
one
is
foolish
to
grieve
over
what
some
would
say
is
a
trifle
compared
to
other
losses
but
one
comes
to
love
books
they
are
his
very
dear
friends
with
them
he
shares
his
great
pleasures
in
times
of
sorrow
they
console
him
ah
yes
how
wonderful
they
are
these
books
his
eyes
turned
toward
the
shelves
then
suddenly
his
voice
changed
he
hastened
on
he
seemed
to
desire
to
have
done
with
it
one
might
have
believed
that
there
was
something
he
was
keeping
back
which
he
was
afraid
his
lips
might
speak
i
came
to
america
he
said
hoarsely
and
here
i
am
in
your
great
city
alone
save
for
this
blessed
child
and
and
my
books
some
of
my
books
most
of
my
books
again
he
was
silent
the
room
fell
into
such
a
silence
that
the
very
breathing
of
the
old
man
sounded
out
like
the
exhaust
of
an
engine
somewhere
in
another
room
a
clock
ticked
it
was
ghostly
shaking
herself
free
from
the
spell
of
it
lucile
said
i
i
think
i
must
go
no
no
cried
the
old
man
not
until
you
have
seen
some
of
my
treasures
my
books
leading
her
to
the
shelves
he
took
down
volume
after
volume
he
placed
them
in
her
hands
with
all
the
care
of
a
salesman
displaying
rare
and
fragile
china
she
looked
at
the
outside
of
some
then
made
bold
to
open
the
covers
and
peep
within
they
were
all
beyond
doubt
very
old
and
valuable
but
one
fact
stood
out
in
her
mind
as
she
finally
bade
them
good
night
stood
out
as
if
embossed
upon
her
very
soul
in
the
inside
upper
corner
of
the
cover
of
every
volume
done
on
expensive
paper
there
was
the
same
gargoyle
the
same
letter
l
as
had
been
in
the
other
mysterious
volumes
the
gargoyle
secret
she
whispered
as
she
came
out
upon
the
dark
damp
streets
the
gargoyle
secret
i
wonder
what
it
is
then
she
started
as
if
in
fear
that
the
gargoyle
were
behind
her
about
to
spring
at
her
from
the
dark
chapter
xiv
a
strange
request
but
lucile
exclaimed
florence
in
an
excited
whisper
springing
up
in
her
bed
after
she
had
heard
lucile
story
how
did
the
police
know
that
something
was
going
wrong
in
that
house
how
did
they
come
to
be
right
there
when
you
needed
them
most
that
just
what
i
asked
the
sergeant
answered
lucile
and
he
just
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
tipped
it
off
which
meant
i
suppose
that
someone
reported
the
fact
to
police
headquarters
that
something
was
wrong
in
that
house
i
suppose
so
is
that
all
you
know
about
it
why
i
i
thought
i
heard
someone
hurrying
away
on
the
sidewalk
just
as
i
was
going
to
enter
you
do
suppose
oh
i
do
know
what
to
suppose
lucile
gave
a
short
hysterical
laugh
it
is
getting
to
be
much
too
complicated
for
me
i
ca
stand
it
much
longer
something
going
to
burst
i
think
all
the
time
that
someone
is
dogging
my
tracks
i
think
someone
must
suspect
me
of
being
in
league
with
this
old
man
and
the
child
but
if
they
did
why
should
they
call
the
police
for
your
protection
yes
why
why
a
whole
lot
of
whys
and
who
would
suspect
me
i
would
trust
frank
morrow
to
keep
faith
with
me
i
am
sure
he
trusts
me
fully
the
portland
chart
book
affair
i
was
not
in
at
all
the
bindery
would
scarcely
suspect
me
there
only
our
own
library
left
you
do
think
one
scarcely
knows
what
to
think
said
florence
wearily
we
sometimes
forget
that
we
are
but
two
poor
girls
who
are
more
or
less
dependent
on
the
university
for
our
support
while
we
secure
an
education
perhaps
you
should
have
confided
in
the
library
authorities
in
the
beginning
perhaps
but
it
too
late
now
i
must
see
the
thing
through
you
do
believe
the
old
frenchman
story
i
do
know
it
hard
to
doubt
it
he
seems
so
sincere
something
left
out
i
suppose
of
course
there
is
in
order
to
keep
from
starving
he
was
obliged
to
sell
some
of
his
books
then
being
heartbroken
over
the
loss
of
them
he
has
induced
the
child
to
steal
them
back
for
him
that
seems
sensible
enough
does
it
of
course
it
a
pity
that
he
should
have
been
forced
to
sell
them
but
they
were
in
a
way
a
luxury
we
all
are
obliged
to
give
up
some
luxuries
for
my
part
i
do
see
how
you
are
going
to
keep
him
out
of
jail
the
child
will
probably
come
clear
because
of
her
age
but
there
not
a
chance
in
a
million
of
saving
him
there
got
to
be
a
sometime
why
not
now
the
facts
we
have
in
our
possession
are
the
rightful
property
of
others
of
our
library
frank
morrow
the
scientific
library
of
the
bindery
why
not
pass
them
on
florence
was
sitting
bolt
upright
in
bed
she
pointed
her
finger
at
her
roommate
by
way
of
emphasis
but
tired
and
perplexed
as
she
was
lucile
never
flinched
your
logic
is
all
right
save
for
two
things
she
smiled
wearily
what
two
the
character
of
the
old
man
and
the
character
of
the
child
they
could
not
do
the
thing
you
suggest
no
not
for
far
greater
reward
not
in
a
thousand
years
she
beat
the
bed
with
her
hands
there
must
be
some
other
explanation
there
must
there
must
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
in
the
room
lucile
removed
her
street
garments
put
on
her
dream
robe
then
crept
into
bed
oh
she
sighed
i
forgot
to
tell
you
what
that
extraordinary
child
asked
me
to
do
what
she
said
she
had
an
errand
to
do
for
the
old
frenchman
that
it
would
take
her
a
long
way
from
home
and
she
was
afraid
to
go
alone
she
asked
me
if
i
would
go
with
her
what
did
you
tell
her
i
i
told
her
that
both
my
roommate
and
i
would
go
you
did
why
yes
well
said
florence
after
a
moment
thought
i
go
but
if
another
frightful
robbery
if
she
going
to
break
in
somewhere
and
carry
away
some
book
worth
thousands
of
dollars
i
not
in
on
it
i
i
drag
her
to
the
nearest
police
station
and
our
fine
little
mystery
will
end
right
there
oh
i
do
think
it
can
be
anything
like
that
said
lucile
sleepily
anyway
we
can
only
wait
and
see
with
that
she
turned
her
right
cheek
over
on
the
pillow
and
was
instantly
fast
asleep
chapter
xv
a
strange
journey
the
hours
of
the
following
day
dragged
as
if
on
leaden
wings
with
nerves
worn
to
single
strands
lucile
was
now
literally
living
on
excitement
the
fact
that
she
was
to
go
with
the
mystery
child
on
a
night
trip
which
held
promise
of
excitement
and
possible
adventure
in
it
went
far
toward
keeping
her
eyes
open
and
on
their
task
but
for
all
this
the
hours
dragged
at
the
library
she
was
startled
to
note
the
worn
and
haggard
look
on
harry
brock
face
she
wanted
to
ask
him
the
cause
of
it
and
to
offer
sympathy
but
he
appeared
to
actually
avoid
her
whenever
she
found
some
excuse
to
move
in
his
direction
he
at
once
found
one
for
moving
away
to
another
corner
of
the
library
whatever
can
be
the
matter
with
him
she
asked
herself
i
wonder
if
i
could
have
offended
him
in
any
way
i
should
hate
to
lose
his
friendship
night
came
at
last
and
with
it
the
elevated
station
and
tyler
street
with
her
usual
promptness
the
child
led
them
to
a
surface
car
they
rode
across
the
city
from
the
car
they
hurried
to
an
depot
of
a
steam
line
so
it
to
be
out
of
the
city
florence
whispered
to
lucile
i
counted
on
that
it
may
be
more
than
we
bargained
for
i
hope
not
shivered
lucile
i
been
all
warmed
up
over
this
trip
the
whole
day
through
and
now
when
we
are
actually
on
the
way
i
feel
cold
as
a
clam
and
sort
of
creepy
all
over
do
do
you
suppose
it
will
be
anything
very
dreadful
why
no
laughed
florence
far
as
feelings
go
mine
have
been
just
the
opposite
to
yours
i
did
want
to
go
and
felt
that
way
all
day
but
now
it
would
take
all
the
conductors
in
the
service
to
put
me
off
the
train
with
all
the
seriousness
of
a
the
child
purchased
tickets
for
them
all
and
now
gave
them
to
the
conductor
without
so
much
as
suggesting
their
destination
to
the
girls
i
do
know
where
i
going
but
i
on
my
way
whispered
florence
with
a
smile
seems
strange
does
it
said
lucile
sh
warned
florence
the
child
had
turned
a
smiling
face
toward
them
i
think
it
awfully
good
of
you
to
come
she
beamed
it
a
long
way
and
i
afraid
we
be
late
getting
home
but
you
wo
have
to
do
anything
not
really
just
go
along
with
me
it
a
dreadfully
lonesome
place
there
a
long
road
you
have
to
go
over
and
the
road
crosses
a
river
and
there
is
woods
on
both
sides
of
the
river
woods
are
awful
sort
of
spooky
at
night
do
you
think
so
florence
smiled
and
nodded
lucile
shivered
i
do
mind
the
city
the
child
went
on
not
any
of
it
there
are
always
people
everywhere
and
things
ca
be
spooky
there
but
right
out
on
the
roads
and
in
the
woods
and
on
beaches
where
the
water
goes
at
night
i
do
like
that
do
you
sometimes
i
do
said
florence
i
think
i
going
to
like
it
a
lot
oh
are
you
exclaimed
the
child
then
i
glad
because
it
was
awfully
nice
of
you
to
come
a
long
road
woods
and
a
river
florence
repeated
in
lucile
ear
wherever
can
we
be
going
i
supposed
we
would
get
off
at
one
of
the
suburbs
evidently
said
lucile
forcing
a
smile
we
are
in
for
a
night
of
it
i
going
to
catch
forty
winks
call
me
when
we
get
to
the
road
that
crosses
the
river
in
the
woods
she
bent
her
head
down
upon
one
hand
and
was
soon
fast
asleep
she
was
awakened
by
a
shake
from
florence
we
here
come
on
get
off
what
they
saw
on
alighting
was
not
reassuring
a
small
red
depot
a
narrow
irregular
platform
a
square
of
light
through
which
they
saw
a
young
man
with
a
green
shade
over
his
eyes
bending
before
a
table
filled
with
telegraph
instruments
this
was
all
they
saw
beyond
these
like
the
entrance
to
some
huge
magical
cave
the
darkness
loomed
at
them
the
child
appeared
to
know
the
way
even
in
the
dark
for
she
pulled
at
florence
sleeve
as
she
whispered
this
way
please
keep
close
to
me
there
was
not
the
least
danger
of
the
girls
failing
to
keep
close
for
once
they
had
passed
beyond
sight
of
that
friendly
square
of
light
and
the
figure
they
were
hopelessly
lost
true
the
darkness
shaded
off
a
trifle
as
their
eyes
became
more
accustomed
to
it
they
could
tell
that
they
were
going
down
a
badly
kept
sandy
road
they
could
see
the
dim
outline
of
trees
on
either
side
but
that
was
all
the
trees
seemed
a
wall
which
shut
them
in
on
either
side
trees
spooky
at
night
lucile
whispered
as
she
gripped
her
companion
arm
a
little
more
tightly
where
are
we
florence
whispered
i
could
guess
pretty
far
out
i
counted
five
stops
after
the
lights
of
the
city
disappeared
listen
what
is
it
water
rushing
along
somewhere
might
be
the
river
she
said
there
was
one
rivers
rush
like
that
in
the
mountains
but
not
here
must
be
the
lake
shore
hist
the
child
was
whispering
back
at
them
we
are
coming
to
the
bridge
a
very
long
bridge
and
spooky
i
think
we
better
tiptoe
across
it
but
we
must
run
the
gallopin
goblins
come
after
us
if
we
do
besides
there
an
old
rusty
sign
on
the
bridge
that
says
trotting
across
the
bridge
the
next
moment
they
felt
a
plank
surface
beneath
their
feet
and
knew
they
were
on
the
bridge
it
must
have
been
a
very
ancient
bridge
this
road
had
never
been
remodelled
to
fit
the
need
of
automobiles
the
planks
rattled
and
creaked
in
an
ominous
manner
in
spite
of
their
tiptoeing
i
wonder
how
much
more
there
is
of
it
florence
groaned
in
a
whisper
when
they
had
gone
on
tiptoes
for
what
seemed
an
endless
space
of
time
if
my
toes
do
break
i
sure
my
shoes
will
as
for
lucile
she
was
thinking
her
own
thoughts
she
was
telling
herself
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
this
night
performance
gave
promise
of
being
a
link
in
the
chain
of
circumstances
which
were
to
be
used
in
dragging
the
gargoyle
secret
from
its
lair
she
would
demand
that
the
child
turn
about
and
lead
them
straight
back
to
the
city
since
she
had
faith
that
somehow
the
mystery
was
to
be
solved
and
her
many
worries
and
perplexities
brought
to
an
end
she
tiptoed
doggedly
on
and
it
was
well
that
she
did
for
the
events
of
this
one
night
were
destined
to
bring
about
strange
and
astounding
revelations
she
was
not
to
see
the
light
of
day
again
before
the
gargoyle
secret
would
be
fully
revealed
but
had
she
known
the
series
of
thrilling
events
which
would
lead
up
to
that
triumphant
hour
she
would
have
shrunk
back
and
whispered
no
no
i
ca
go
all
that
way
often
and
often
we
find
this
true
in
life
we
face
seemingly
unbearable
situations
something
is
to
happen
to
us
we
are
to
go
somewhere
be
something
different
do
some
seemingly
undoable
thing
and
we
say
we
can
not
endure
it
yet
we
pass
through
it
as
through
a
fog
to
come
out
smiling
on
the
other
side
we
are
better
happier
and
stronger
for
the
experience
it
was
to
be
so
with
lucile
the
bridge
was
crossed
at
last
more
dark
and
silent
woods
came
to
flank
their
path
then
out
of
the
distance
there
loomed
great
bulks
of
darker
masses
mountains
i
say
they
were
whispered
lucile
if
it
were
for
the
fact
that
i
know
there
are
none
within
five
hundred
miles
for
a
time
they
trudged
along
in
silence
then
suddenly
florence
whispered
oh
i
know
dunes
sand
dunes
now
i
know
where
we
are
we
are
near
the
lake
shore
i
was
out
here
somewhere
for
a
week
last
summer
by
day
wonderful
regular
mountains
of
sand
that
has
been
washed
up
and
blown
up
from
the
bed
of
the
lake
some
of
them
are
hundreds
of
feet
above
the
level
of
the
lake
there
are
trees
growing
on
them
and
everything
but
what
are
we
doing
out
here
i
ca
guess
there
is
a
wonderful
beach
everywhere
and
cottages
here
and
there
but
it
too
late
for
summer
cottages
they
must
all
be
closed
yes
of
course
they
must
again
they
trudged
on
in
silence
now
they
left
the
road
to
strike
away
across
the
soft
yielding
surface
of
the
sand
they
sank
in
to
their
ankles
some
of
the
sand
got
into
their
shoes
and
hurt
their
feet
but
still
they
trudged
on
the
rush
of
waters
on
the
shore
grew
louder
i
love
it
florence
whispered
i
like
sleeping
where
i
can
hear
the
rush
of
water
i
slept
beside
the
arctic
ocean
the
behring
sea
and
the
pacific
i
slept
by
the
shore
of
this
old
lake
once
in
the
rocky
mountains
i
climbed
to
the
and
there
slept
for
five
nights
in
a
tent
where
all
night
long
you
could
hear
the
rush
of
icy
water
over
rocks
which
were
more
like
a
stony
stairway
than
the
bed
of
a
stream
it
was
grand
when
i
am
sleeping
where
i
can
hear
the
rush
of
water
i
sometimes
half
awaken
at
night
and
imagine
i
am
once
more
on
the
shore
of
the
arctic
or
in
a
tent
at
the
of
the
rockies
while
she
was
whispering
this
they
felt
the
sand
suddenly
harden
beneath
their
feet
and
knew
that
they
had
reached
the
beach
you
know
the
child
whispered
suddenly
and
mysteriously
back
at
them
i
do
like
beaches
at
night
i
lived
by
one
when
i
was
a
very
little
girl
there
was
a
very
very
old
woman
lived
there
too
she
told
me
many
terrible
stories
of
the
sea
and
do
you
know
once
she
told
me
something
that
has
made
me
afraid
to
be
by
the
shore
at
night
it
makes
it
spooky
she
suddenly
seized
lucile
arm
with
a
grip
that
hurt
while
she
whispered
that
why
i
wanted
you
to
come
she
told
me
she
went
on
that
old
woman
told
me
lucile
fancied
she
could
see
the
child
frightened
eyes
gleaming
out
of
the
night
about
the
men
who
were
lost
at
sea
brave
seamen
who
go
on
ships
and
brave
soldiers
too
their
bodies
get
washed
all
about
on
the
bottom
of
the
water
the
fishes
eat
them
and
by
and
by
they
are
all
gone
but
their
souls
ca
be
eaten
no
sir
no
one
can
eat
them
the
old
woman
told
me
that
the
child
paused
her
breath
was
coming
quick
her
grip
tightened
on
lucile
arm
as
she
whispered
and
sometimes
i
afraid
one
of
their
souls
will
get
washed
right
up
on
the
sand
at
night
that
what
frightens
me
so
what
do
you
think
it
would
look
like
what
do
you
would
it
be
all
yellow
and
fiery
like
a
glowworm
or
would
it
be
just
white
like
a
sheet
florence
whispered
lucile
with
a
shiver
tell
her
to
be
quiet
she
drive
me
mad
but
there
was
no
need
there
is
much
courage
to
be
gained
by
telling
our
secret
fears
to
others
the
child
had
apparently
relieved
her
soul
of
a
great
burden
for
she
tramped
on
once
more
in
silence
several
moments
had
passed
when
she
suddenly
paused
before
some
dark
object
which
stood
out
above
the
sand
a
boat
whispered
lucile
if
you
just
help
me
said
the
child
we
can
push
it
into
the
water
what
for
florence
asked
why
to
go
in
of
course
it
the
only
way
for
a
moment
the
two
girls
stood
there
undecided
then
florence
whispered
oh
come
on
it
not
rough
might
as
well
see
it
through
chapter
xvi
night
visitors
a
moment
later
they
were
listening
to
the
creak
of
rusty
oarlocks
and
the
almost
inaudible
of
the
oars
as
the
child
herself
sent
the
boat
out
from
the
beach
to
bring
it
half
about
and
skirt
the
shore
the
boat
was
some
sixteen
feet
long
a
craft
it
was
light
and
buoyant
but
for
all
that
with
three
persons
aboard
the
rowing
of
it
was
a
tax
on
the
strength
of
the
child
slender
arms
to
add
to
her
troubles
the
water
began
to
rubber
up
a
bit
small
waves
came
the
boat
side
once
a
bit
of
spray
broke
in
face
here
she
whispered
it
too
heavy
for
you
let
me
have
the
oars
then
you
tell
me
which
way
to
go
straight
ahead
only
not
too
close
in
there
a
wall
a
wall
lucile
thought
to
herself
sounds
like
a
prison
there
a
parole
camp
out
here
somewhere
it
ca
be
she
shuddered
no
of
course
not
what
would
that
old
man
and
child
have
to
do
with
prisons
then
suddenly
an
ugly
thought
forced
its
way
into
her
mind
perhaps
after
all
these
two
were
members
of
a
gang
of
robbers
perhaps
a
member
of
the
gang
had
been
in
prison
and
was
at
this
moment
in
the
parole
camp
what
if
this
turned
out
to
be
a
expedition
no
no
she
whispered
as
she
shook
herself
to
free
her
mind
of
the
thought
there
the
wall
whispered
florence
as
a
gray
bulk
loomed
up
to
the
right
of
them
they
passed
it
in
silence
to
lucile
they
seemed
like
marines
running
a
blockade
in
time
of
war
but
florence
was
busy
with
other
thoughts
that
wall
seemed
vaguely
familiar
to
her
it
was
as
if
she
had
seen
it
in
a
dream
yet
could
not
recall
the
details
of
the
dream
a
storm
was
brewing
off
in
the
west
now
and
then
a
distant
flash
of
lightning
lighted
up
the
surrounding
waters
of
a
sudden
one
of
these
more
brilliant
than
the
rest
lighted
up
the
shore
which
at
a
word
from
the
child
they
were
now
nearing
what
florence
saw
was
a
small
artificially
dredged
buoy
with
a
dock
and
large
boathouse
at
the
back
instantly
what
had
been
a
dream
became
a
reality
she
had
seen
that
wall
and
the
little
buoy
and
boathouse
as
well
only
the
summer
before
she
had
spent
two
nights
and
a
day
with
a
party
on
the
dunes
they
had
hired
a
motor
boat
and
had
skirted
the
shore
this
place
had
been
pointed
out
to
her
and
described
as
the
most
elaborate
and
beautiful
summer
cottage
on
the
shore
why
she
whispered
with
a
sigh
of
relief
this
is
the
summer
cottage
of
your
friend
stanley
ramsey
the
young
man
you
saw
at
frank
morrow
place
and
whom
we
saw
later
at
the
mystery
cottage
this
any
brigandish
thieving
expedition
it
is
merely
a
business
trip
probably
the
old
man
has
sold
him
one
of
his
books
lucile
first
reaction
to
this
news
was
intense
relief
this
was
not
a
expedition
in
fact
was
not
to
be
in
any
way
an
adventure
but
the
next
instant
doubt
came
what
would
that
young
man
be
doing
in
a
summer
cottage
at
this
time
of
year
she
demanded
all
the
cottages
must
have
been
closed
for
nearly
a
month
society
flies
back
to
the
city
in
september
besides
if
plain
business
why
all
this
slipping
in
at
the
lake
front
instead
of
passing
through
the
gate
florence
was
silent
at
that
she
had
no
answer
does
seem
strange
she
mused
there
a
very
high
fence
all
about
the
place
but
of
course
there
must
be
a
gate
the
next
instant
the
boat
grated
on
the
sandy
beach
and
they
were
all
climbing
out
lucile
shivered
as
she
caught
sight
of
a
large
low
rambling
building
which
lay
well
up
from
the
shore
what
next
she
whispered
to
herself
the
storm
was
still
rumbling
in
the
west
the
sky
to
the
east
was
clear
out
from
the
black
waters
of
the
lake
the
moon
was
rolling
its
light
suddenly
brightened
up
the
shore
the
girls
stared
about
them
up
from
the
beach
a
little
way
was
an
affair
which
resembled
an
indian
tepee
it
was
built
of
boards
and
covered
with
birch
bark
its
white
sides
glimmered
in
the
moonlight
through
the
shadows
of
trees
and
shrubbery
they
made
out
a
rustic
pavilion
and
beyond
that
the
cottage
which
was
built
in
rustic
fashion
as
befits
a
summer
residence
of
a
millionaire
although
little
short
of
a
mansion
would
you
like
to
see
the
inside
of
it
breathed
florence
always
wondered
what
such
a
place
was
like
yes
whispered
lucile
but
i
prefer
daylight
they
had
been
following
the
child
she
had
led
them
as
far
as
a
rustic
arbor
built
of
cedar
poles
with
the
bark
left
on
this
presented
itself
as
an
inviting
place
to
rest
you
stay
here
the
child
whispered
i
come
back
she
vanished
into
the
shadows
well
whispered
lucile
what
do
you
make
of
it
florence
asked
nothing
yet
is
someone
here
to
meet
her
or
is
she
entering
the
place
to
get
something
do
know
i
lucile
stopped
short
did
you
see
that
she
whispered
tensely
as
she
gripped
her
companion
arm
what
there
was
a
flash
of
light
in
the
right
wing
of
the
building
like
the
flicker
of
a
match
she
ca
have
reached
there
yet
no
do
you
think
we
should
warn
her
i
ca
help
thinking
she
going
to
break
into
the
place
if
she
is
she
should
be
caught
if
we
think
she
is
perhaps
we
should
notify
the
police
the
police
in
such
a
place
you
forget
that
we
are
many
miles
from
the
city
and
two
or
three
miles
from
even
a
railroad
station
guess
have
to
see
it
through
let
do
it
then
the
two
girls
rose
and
began
making
their
way
stealthily
in
the
direction
the
child
had
taken
now
and
again
they
paused
to
listen
once
they
heard
a
sound
like
the
creaking
of
a
door
lucile
caught
a
second
flash
of
light
they
paused
behind
two
pine
trees
not
ten
feet
from
the
side
entrance
the
wind
rustled
in
the
pine
trees
the
water
broke
ceaselessly
on
the
shore
otherwise
all
was
silence
creepy
whispered
lucile
ghostly
florence
shivered
i
believe
that
door
ajar
it
is
let
creep
up
close
the
next
moment
found
them
flattened
against
the
wall
beside
the
door
this
door
stood
half
open
suddenly
they
caught
a
flash
of
light
leaning
far
over
to
peer
within
they
saw
the
child
bent
over
before
a
huge
bookcase
the
room
half
illumined
by
her
flashlight
was
a
large
lounging
room
the
trimmings
were
rustic
and
massive
beamed
ceiling
and
heavy
beams
along
the
walls
were
flanked
by
a
huge
fireplace
at
the
back
the
furniture
was
in
keeping
massive
mission
oak
with
leather
cushions
on
chairs
what
a
wonderful
place
florence
whispered
what
would
one
give
to
have
it
for
a
study
the
child
had
taken
three
books
from
the
shelves
all
these
she
replaced
she
was
examining
the
fourth
when
lucile
whispered
that
the
one
she
has
come
for
why
the
light
fell
full
upon
the
inside
of
the
cover
i
saw
the
gargoyle
there
the
prediction
proved
a
true
one
for
after
carefully
closing
the
case
the
child
switched
off
the
light
scarcely
realizing
what
they
were
doing
the
girls
lingered
by
the
door
then
suddenly
lucile
realized
their
position
she
be
here
in
a
second
she
whispered
they
turned
but
not
quickly
enough
for
of
a
sudden
a
glare
of
light
from
a
powerful
electric
flashlight
blinded
them
while
a
masculine
voice
with
a
distinctly
youthful
ring
to
it
demanded
who
there
to
their
consternation
the
girls
felt
the
child
bump
into
them
as
she
backed
away
and
there
they
all
stood
framed
in
a
circle
of
light
the
glaring
light
with
darkness
behind
it
made
it
impossible
for
them
to
see
the
new
arrival
but
lucile
knew
instantly
from
the
voice
that
it
was
the
millionaire
son
for
a
full
moment
no
one
spoke
the
of
a
prodigious
clock
in
one
corner
of
the
room
sounded
out
like
the
ringing
of
a
curfew
oh
i
see
came
at
last
in
youthful
tones
from
the
corner
just
some
girls
and
pretty
ones
too
i
be
bound
came
to
borrow
a
book
did
you
who
let
you
in
i
wonder
but
never
mind
suppose
you
here
for
a
at
one
of
the
cottages
and
needed
some
reading
matter
rather
unconventional
way
of
getting
it
but
it
all
right
just
drop
it
in
the
mail
box
at
the
gate
when
you
done
with
it
the
girls
suddenly
became
conscious
of
the
fact
that
the
child
was
doing
her
best
to
push
them
out
of
the
door
yielding
to
her
backward
shoves
they
sank
away
into
the
shadows
and
scarcely
believing
their
senses
found
themselves
apparently
quite
free
to
go
their
way
that
breathed
florence
was
awful
decent
of
him
decent
lucile
exploded
it
it
was
grand
look
here
she
turned
almost
savagely
upon
the
child
you
did
intend
to
give
that
book
back
but
you
going
to
do
it
you
going
to
put
it
in
that
mail
box
oh
no
i
not
the
child
said
cheerfully
you
you
not
lucile
stammered
what
right
have
you
to
keep
it
what
right
has
he
it
does
not
belong
to
him
it
belongs
to
monsieur
le
bon
why
that
nonsense
that
lucile
broke
off
suddenly
look
she
exclaimed
the
boat
gone
it
was
all
too
true
they
had
reached
the
beach
where
they
had
left
the
boat
it
had
vanished
so
we
are
prisoners
after
all
florence
whispered
and
and
he
was
just
making
fun
of
us
he
knew
we
could
get
away
breathed
lucile
sinking
hopelessly
down
upon
the
sand
chapter
xvii
a
battle
in
the
night
oh
brace
up
exclaimed
florence
a
note
of
impatience
creeping
into
her
voice
we
get
out
of
this
place
some
way
perhaps
the
boat
taken
perhaps
it
has
she
stopped
to
stare
away
across
the
water
i
believe
it
out
there
away
down
the
beach
look
lucile
look
sharp
the
moon
had
gone
behind
a
small
cloud
as
it
came
out
they
could
see
clearly
the
dark
bulk
of
the
boat
dancing
on
the
water
which
was
by
now
roughening
up
before
the
rising
storm
it
out
there
exclaimed
florence
we
failed
to
pull
it
ashore
far
enough
there
is
a
side
sweep
to
the
waves
that
carried
it
out
we
must
get
it
yes
oh
yes
we
must
the
child
exclaimed
it
was
mine
it
was
borrowed
you
borrow
a
lot
of
things
exclaimed
florence
oh
no
indeed
not
many
not
hardly
any
at
all
but
florence
how
can
we
get
it
protested
lucile
i
a
strong
swimmer
i
swam
a
mile
once
the
boat
out
only
a
few
hundred
yards
it
will
be
easy
not
with
your
clothes
on
florence
did
not
answer
she
threw
a
glance
toward
the
cottage
all
was
dark
there
here
lucile
felt
a
garment
thrust
into
her
hands
then
another
and
another
florence
you
must
it
the
only
way
a
moment
later
florence
white
body
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
as
she
raced
away
down
the
beach
to
gain
the
point
nearest
the
boat
to
the
listening
ears
of
lucile
and
the
child
there
came
the
sound
of
a
splash
then
the
slow
plash
plash
plash
of
a
swimmer
strokes
florence
was
away
and
swimming
strong
but
the
wind
from
off
a
point
had
caught
the
boat
and
was
carrying
it
out
from
shore
driving
it
on
faster
than
she
knew
confident
of
her
ability
to
reach
the
goal
in
a
mere
breath
of
time
she
struck
out
at
once
with
the
splendid
swing
of
the
australian
crawl
trained
to
the
pink
of
perfection
her
every
muscle
in
condition
she
laughed
at
the
wavelets
that
lifted
her
up
only
to
drop
her
down
again
and
now
and
again
to
dash
a
saucy
handful
of
spray
in
her
face
she
laughed
and
even
hummed
a
snatch
of
an
old
sea
song
she
was
as
much
at
home
in
the
water
as
in
her
room
at
the
university
but
now
as
she
got
farther
from
the
shore
the
waves
grew
in
size
and
force
they
impeded
her
progress
the
shore
was
protected
by
a
rocky
point
farther
up
the
beach
she
was
rapidly
leaving
that
protection
throwing
herself
high
out
of
the
water
she
looked
for
the
boat
a
little
cry
of
consternation
escaped
her
lips
she
had
expected
to
find
it
close
at
hand
it
seemed
as
far
away
as
when
she
had
first
seen
it
it
the
wind
off
the
point
she
breathed
it
taking
it
out
to
sea
it
it
going
to
be
a
battle
a
real
scrap
once
more
she
struck
out
with
the
powerful
stroke
which
carries
one
far
but
draws
heavily
upon
his
emergency
fund
of
energy
for
three
full
moments
she
battled
the
waves
then
all
but
breathless
she
slipped
over
on
her
back
to
do
the
dead
man
float
just
for
a
few
seconds
got
to
save
my
strength
but
i
ca
waste
time
now
for
the
first
time
she
realized
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
she
would
lose
this
fight
the
realization
of
what
it
meant
if
she
did
lose
swept
over
her
and
left
her
cold
and
numb
to
go
back
was
impossible
the
wind
and
waves
were
too
strong
for
that
to
fail
to
reach
the
boat
meant
death
turning
back
again
into
swimming
position
she
struck
out
once
more
but
this
time
it
was
not
the
crawl
that
cost
too
much
with
an
easy
swing
which
taxed
the
reserve
forces
little
more
than
floating
she
set
her
teeth
hard
resolved
slowly
but
surely
to
win
her
way
to
the
boat
and
to
safety
moments
passed
long
agonizing
moments
lucile
on
the
shore
by
the
gleam
of
a
flare
of
lightning
caught
now
and
then
a
glimpse
of
the
swimmer
little
by
little
she
became
conscious
of
the
real
situation
when
it
dawned
upon
her
that
florence
was
in
real
peril
she
thought
of
rushing
to
the
cottage
and
calling
to
her
assistance
any
who
might
be
there
then
she
looked
at
the
bundle
of
clothing
in
her
arms
and
flushed
she
never
forgive
me
she
whispered
florence
still
battling
felt
the
spray
break
over
her
but
still
kept
on
the
even
swing
now
and
again
high
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
she
saw
the
boat
she
was
cheered
by
the
fact
that
each
time
it
appeared
to
loom
a
little
larger
gaining
she
whispered
fifty
yards
to
go
again
moments
passed
and
again
she
whispered
gaining
thirty
yards
a
third
time
she
whispered
twenty
yards
after
that
it
was
a
quiet
silent
battle
which
caused
her
very
senses
to
reel
indeed
at
times
she
appeared
conscious
of
only
one
thing
the
mechanical
swing
of
her
arms
the
kick
kick
of
her
feet
they
seemed
but
mechanical
attachments
run
by
some
electrical
power
when
at
last
the
boat
loomed
black
and
large
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
just
above
her
she
had
barely
enough
brain
energy
left
to
order
her
arms
into
a
new
motion
striking
upward
with
her
right
hand
she
gripped
the
craft
side
the
next
instant
with
a
superhuman
effort
without
overturning
it
she
threw
herself
into
the
boat
there
to
fall
panting
across
a
seat
wha
what
a
battle
she
gasped
but
i
won
i
won
for
two
minutes
she
lay
there
motionless
then
drawing
herself
stiffly
up
to
a
sitting
position
she
adjusted
the
oars
to
their
oarlocks
and
bending
forward
threw
all
her
magnificent
strength
into
the
business
of
battling
the
waves
and
bringing
the
boat
safely
ashore
there
are
few
crafts
more
capable
of
riding
a
stormy
sea
than
is
a
rowboat
light
as
a
cork
it
rides
the
waves
like
a
seagull
florence
was
not
long
in
finding
this
out
her
trip
ashore
was
one
of
joyous
triumph
she
had
fought
a
hard
physical
battle
and
won
this
was
her
hour
of
triumph
her
lips
thrilled
a
which
was
heard
with
delight
by
her
friends
on
land
her
bare
arms
worked
like
twin
levers
to
a
powerful
engine
as
she
brought
the
boat
around
and
shot
it
toward
shore
a
moment
for
rejoicing
two
for
dressing
then
they
all
three
tumbled
into
the
boat
to
make
the
tossing
trip
round
the
wall
to
shore
on
the
other
side
for
the
moment
the
book
tightly
pressed
under
the
child
arm
was
forgotten
florence
talked
of
swimming
and
rowing
she
talked
of
plans
for
a
possible
summer
outing
which
included
days
upon
the
water
and
weeks
within
the
forest
primeval
as
they
left
the
boat
on
the
beach
they
could
see
that
the
storm
was
passing
to
the
north
of
them
it
had
however
hidden
the
moon
the
path
through
the
forest
and
across
the
river
was
engulfed
in
darkness
once
more
the
child
prattled
of
haunts
spooks
and
goblins
but
for
once
lucile
nerves
were
not
disturbed
her
mind
had
gone
back
to
the
old
problems
the
mystery
of
the
gargoyle
and
all
the
knotty
questions
which
had
come
to
be
associated
with
it
this
night
a
new
mystery
had
thrust
its
head
up
out
of
the
dark
and
an
old
theory
had
been
exploded
she
had
thought
that
the
young
millionaire
son
might
be
in
league
with
the
old
man
and
the
child
in
carrying
away
and
disposing
of
old
and
valuable
books
but
here
was
the
child
coming
out
to
this
all
but
deserted
cottage
at
night
to
take
a
book
from
the
young
man
library
he
has
a
thing
in
the
world
to
do
with
it
she
told
herself
he
she
paused
in
her
perplexing
problem
to
grip
her
companion
arm
and
whisper
what
was
that
they
were
nearing
the
plank
bridge
she
felt
certain
that
she
heard
a
footstep
upon
it
but
now
as
she
listened
she
heard
nothing
but
the
onrush
of
distant
waters
just
your
nerves
answered
florence
it
was
not
i
was
not
thinking
of
the
child
foolish
chatter
i
was
thinking
of
our
problem
of
the
gargoyle
secret
someone
is
crossing
the
bridge
even
as
she
spoke
as
if
in
proof
of
her
declaration
there
came
a
faint
as
of
someone
moving
on
the
bridge
on
tiptoe
someone
is
shadowing
us
lucile
whispered
looks
that
way
who
is
it
someone
from
the
cottage
perhaps
watching
to
see
what
the
child
does
with
the
book
she
must
take
it
back
yes
she
must
it
might
be
and
here
even
florence
shuddered
it
might
be
that
someone
had
shadowed
us
all
the
way
from
the
city
the
one
who
followed
me
the
night
i
got
caught
in
that
wretched
house
and
other
times
yes
but
he
could
have
gone
all
the
way
not
up
to
the
cottage
he
could
get
through
the
fence
and
there
was
no
other
boat
well
anyway
whoever
it
is
we
must
go
on
wo
do
any
good
standing
here
shivering
once
more
they
pressed
into
the
dark
and
once
more
lucile
resumed
her
attempt
to
disentangle
the
many
problems
which
lay
before
her
chapter
xviii
frank
morrow
joins
in
the
hunt
that
she
had
reached
the
limit
of
her
resources
her
power
to
reason
and
to
endure
lucile
knew
right
well
to
go
on
as
she
had
been
day
after
day
each
day
adding
some
new
responsibility
to
her
already
overburdened
shoulders
was
to
invite
disaster
it
was
not
fair
to
others
the
set
of
shakespeare
the
volume
of
portland
charts
the
volume
from
the
bindery
and
this
book
just
taken
from
the
summer
home
of
the
millionaire
were
all
for
the
moment
in
the
hands
of
the
old
man
and
the
child
how
long
would
they
remain
there
no
one
could
tell
save
the
old
man
and
perhaps
the
child
that
she
had
had
no
part
whatever
in
the
taking
of
any
of
them
unless
her
accompanying
of
the
child
on
this
trip
might
be
called
taking
a
part
she
knew
quite
well
yet
one
is
responsible
for
what
one
knows
i
should
have
told
what
i
knew
about
the
set
of
shakespeare
in
the
beginning
she
chided
herself
then
there
would
have
been
no
other
problems
all
the
other
books
would
be
at
this
moment
in
their
proper
places
and
the
old
man
and
child
would
be
she
could
not
say
the
words
in
jail
it
was
too
terrible
to
contemplate
that
man
and
that
child
in
jail
and
yet
she
suddenly
remembered
the
child
declaration
that
she
would
not
return
the
book
to
the
summer
cottage
she
had
said
the
book
belonged
to
the
old
man
perhaps
after
all
it
did
she
had
seen
the
millionaire
son
in
the
mystery
room
talking
to
the
old
man
perhaps
after
all
he
had
borrowed
the
book
and
the
child
had
been
sent
for
it
there
was
some
consolation
in
that
thought
but
that
does
not
solve
any
of
the
other
problems
she
told
herself
and
besides
if
she
has
a
right
to
the
book
why
all
this
creeping
up
to
the
cottage
by
night
by
way
of
the
water
and
why
did
he
assume
that
she
was
borrowing
it
and
so
after
all
her
speculation
she
found
herself
just
where
she
had
left
off
the
tangle
was
no
less
a
tangle
than
before
question
is
she
whispered
to
herself
am
i
going
to
go
to
the
police
or
to
the
university
authorities
with
the
story
and
have
these
mysterious
people
arrested
or
am
i
not
they
reached
the
station
just
as
the
last
train
was
pulling
in
florence
and
the
child
had
climbed
aboard
and
lucile
had
her
hand
on
the
rail
when
she
saw
a
skulking
figure
emerge
from
the
shadows
of
the
station
the
person
whoever
he
might
be
darted
down
the
track
to
climb
upon
the
back
platform
just
as
the
train
pulled
out
that
lucile
told
herself
is
the
person
who
crossed
the
bridge
ahead
of
us
he
is
spying
on
us
i
wonder
who
he
is
and
what
he
knows
a
cold
chill
swept
over
her
as
if
a
winter
blast
had
passed
down
the
car
when
florence
had
been
told
of
what
lucile
had
seen
she
suggested
that
they
go
back
and
see
who
the
man
was
what
the
use
said
lucile
we
ca
prove
that
he
following
us
it
would
only
get
us
into
another
mess
and
goodness
knows
we
in
enough
now
so
with
the
mystery
child
curled
up
fast
asleep
in
a
seat
before
them
hugging
the
newly
acquired
book
as
though
it
were
a
doll
they
rattled
back
toward
the
city
in
spite
of
the
many
problems
perplexing
her
lucile
soon
fell
asleep
florence
remained
to
keep
vigil
over
her
companion
the
child
and
the
supposedly
valuable
book
they
saw
nothing
more
of
the
mysterious
person
who
had
apparently
been
following
them
arrived
at
the
city
they
were
confronted
with
the
problem
of
the
immediate
possession
of
the
latest
of
the
strangely
acquired
volumes
should
the
child
be
allowed
to
carry
it
to
the
mysterious
cottage
or
should
they
insist
on
taking
it
to
their
room
for
safe
keeping
they
talked
the
matter
over
in
whispers
just
before
arriving
at
their
station
if
you
attempt
to
make
her
give
it
up
florence
whispered
she
make
a
scene
she
just
that
sort
of
a
little
minx
i
suppose
so
said
lucile
wearily
might
as
well
let
her
keep
it
it
as
safe
as
any
of
the
books
are
at
that
cottage
and
really
it
not
as
much
our
business
as
you
keep
thinking
it
is
we
did
take
the
book
true
we
went
along
with
her
but
she
would
have
gone
anyway
we
not
the
guardians
of
all
the
musty
old
books
in
christendom
let
forget
at
least
this
one
and
let
that
rich
young
man
get
it
back
as
best
he
can
he
took
the
chance
in
allowing
her
to
take
it
away
lucile
did
not
entirely
agree
to
all
this
but
was
too
tired
to
resist
her
companion
logic
so
the
book
went
away
under
the
child
arm
after
a
very
few
hours
of
restless
sleep
lucile
awoke
with
one
resolve
firmly
implanted
in
her
mind
she
would
take
frank
morrow
book
back
to
him
and
place
it
in
his
hand
then
she
would
tell
him
the
part
of
the
story
that
he
did
not
already
know
after
that
she
would
attempt
to
follow
his
advice
in
the
matter
with
the
thin
volume
of
the
compleat
angler
in
the
pocket
of
her
coat
she
made
her
way
at
an
early
hour
to
his
shop
he
had
barely
opened
up
for
the
day
no
customers
were
yet
about
having
done
his
nine
holes
of
golf
before
coming
down
and
having
done
them
exceedingly
well
he
was
feeling
in
a
particularly
good
humor
well
my
young
friend
he
smiled
what
is
it
i
may
do
for
you
this
morning
why
why
he
exclaimed
turning
her
suddenly
about
to
the
light
you
been
losing
sleep
about
something
tut
tut
that
will
never
do
she
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
here
was
a
man
who
was
truly
a
dear
why
i
came
she
smiled
again
as
she
drew
the
valuable
book
from
her
pocket
to
return
your
book
and
to
tell
you
just
how
i
came
to
have
it
that
sounds
interesting
frank
morrow
rubbing
his
hands
together
as
one
does
who
is
anticipating
a
good
yarn
then
led
her
to
a
chair
fifteen
minutes
later
as
the
story
was
finished
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
gave
forth
a
merry
chuckle
as
he
gurgled
fine
oh
fine
that
the
best
little
mystery
story
i
heard
in
a
long
time
costing
me
two
hundred
dollars
but
i
do
begrudge
it
not
a
penny
of
it
the
yarn
really
worth
it
besides
i
shall
make
a
cool
hundred
on
the
book
still
which
is
so
bad
two
hundred
dollars
exclaimed
lucile
in
great
perplexity
yes
the
reward
for
the
return
of
the
book
now
that
the
mystery
is
closed
and
the
book
returned
i
shall
pay
it
to
you
of
course
oh
the
reward
she
said
slowly
yes
of
course
but
really
the
mystery
is
not
ended
it
has
only
just
begun
as
you
like
it
the
shopkeeper
smiled
back
as
matters
go
i
should
call
the
matter
closed
i
have
a
book
stolen
you
recover
it
and
are
able
to
tell
me
that
the
persons
who
stole
it
are
an
old
man
too
feeble
to
work
and
an
innocent
child
you
are
able
to
put
your
finger
on
them
and
to
say
are
the
persons
i
can
have
them
arrested
if
i
choose
i
too
am
an
old
man
not
so
old
as
your
frenchman
yet
old
enough
to
know
something
of
what
he
must
feel
with
the
pinch
of
age
and
poverty
dragging
at
the
tail
of
his
coat
i
happen
to
love
all
little
children
and
to
feel
their
suffering
quite
as
much
as
they
do
when
they
must
suffer
i
do
not
choose
to
have
those
two
people
arrested
that
ends
the
affair
does
it
not
you
have
your
reward
i
my
book
they
go
free
not
because
justice
says
they
should
but
because
a
soft
heart
of
an
old
man
says
they
must
he
smiled
and
brushed
his
eyes
with
the
back
of
his
hands
having
nothing
to
say
lucile
sat
there
in
silence
presently
frank
morrow
began
you
think
this
is
unusual
because
you
do
not
know
how
common
it
is
you
have
never
run
a
bookstore
you
would
perhaps
be
a
little
surprised
to
have
me
tell
you
that
almost
every
day
of
the
year
some
book
more
or
less
valuable
is
stolen
either
from
a
library
or
from
a
bookshop
it
is
done
i
suppose
because
it
seems
so
very
easy
here
is
a
little
volume
worth
we
will
say
ten
dollars
it
will
slip
easily
into
your
pocket
when
the
shopkeeper
is
not
looking
it
does
slip
in
then
again
when
he
is
not
paying
any
particular
attention
to
you
you
slip
out
upon
the
street
you
drink
in
a
few
breaths
of
fresh
air
cast
a
glance
to
right
and
left
of
you
then
walk
away
you
think
the
matter
is
closed
in
reality
it
has
just
begun
in
the
first
place
you
probably
did
not
take
the
book
so
you
might
have
it
for
your
library
collectors
of
rare
books
are
seldom
thieves
they
are
often
cranks
but
honest
cranks
more
books
are
stolen
by
students
than
by
any
other
class
of
people
they
have
a
better
knowledge
of
the
value
of
books
than
the
average
run
of
folks
and
they
more
often
need
the
money
to
be
obtained
from
the
sale
of
such
books
nothing
seems
easier
than
to
take
a
book
from
one
store
to
carry
it
to
another
store
six
or
eight
miles
away
and
sell
it
then
to
wash
your
hands
of
the
whole
matter
nothing
in
reality
is
harder
all
the
bookstore
keepers
of
every
large
city
are
bound
together
in
a
loosely
organized
society
for
mutual
protection
the
workings
of
their
railways
are
swifter
and
more
certain
than
the
united
states
secret
service
the
instant
i
discover
that
one
of
my
books
has
been
carried
off
i
sit
down
and
put
the
name
of
it
on
a
multigraph
this
prints
the
name
on
enough
post
cards
to
go
to
all
the
secondhand
bookshops
in
the
city
when
the
shopkeepers
get
these
cards
they
read
the
name
and
know
the
book
has
been
stolen
if
they
have
already
bought
it
they
start
a
search
for
the
person
who
sold
it
to
them
they
generally
locate
him
if
the
book
has
not
yet
been
disposed
of
every
shopkeeper
is
constantly
on
the
lookout
for
it
until
it
turns
up
so
he
smiled
you
see
how
easy
it
is
to
steal
books
and
yet
they
will
steal
them
he
went
on
why
he
smiled
reminiscently
not
so
long
ago
i
had
the
same
book
stolen
twice
within
the
week
did
you
find
out
who
it
was
in
both
cases
at
once
different
people
entirely
different
never
met
as
far
as
i
know
the
first
one
was
an
out
and
out
rascal
he
wanted
the
money
for
needless
luxuries
we
treated
him
rough
very
rough
the
other
was
a
sick
student
who
we
found
had
used
the
money
to
pay
carfare
to
his
home
i
did
not
even
trouble
to
find
out
where
his
home
was
just
paid
the
ten
dollars
to
the
man
who
had
purchased
the
book
from
him
and
charged
it
off
on
my
books
that
he
stroked
his
chin
thoughtfully
that
does
seem
like
common
sense
or
justice
either
yet
it
is
the
way
men
do
anyway
it
the
way
i
do
again
there
was
silence
but
lucile
hesitated
this
case
is
different
the
mystery
still
exists
why
does
monsieur
le
bon
want
the
books
he
has
not
sold
a
single
volume
something
must
be
done
about
the
books
from
the
university
the
scientific
library
and
the
bindery
that
true
said
frank
morrow
thoughtfully
there
are
angles
to
the
case
that
are
interesting
very
interesting
mind
if
i
smoke
lucile
shook
her
head
thanks
he
filled
and
lighted
his
pipe
mind
going
over
the
whole
story
again
no
not
a
bit
she
began
at
the
beginning
and
told
her
story
this
time
he
interrupted
her
often
and
it
seemed
that
as
he
asked
question
after
question
his
interest
grew
as
the
story
progressed
now
i
tell
you
what
to
do
he
held
up
a
finger
for
emphasis
as
she
concluded
he
leaned
far
forward
and
there
was
a
light
of
adventure
in
his
eye
i
tell
you
what
you
do
here
a
hundred
dollars
he
drew
a
roll
of
bills
from
his
pocket
you
take
this
money
and
buy
yourself
a
ticket
to
new
york
you
can
spare
the
at
least
when
you
get
to
new
york
go
to
burtnoe
book
store
and
ask
for
roderick
vining
he
sold
me
that
copy
of
compleat
angler
i
sent
out
a
bid
for
such
a
book
when
i
had
a
customer
for
it
and
he
was
one
of
two
who
responded
his
book
was
the
best
of
the
two
so
i
took
it
he
is
in
charge
of
fine
binding
in
the
biggest
book
store
in
his
city
they
deal
in
new
books
not
secondhand
ones
but
he
dabbles
in
rare
volumes
on
the
side
tell
him
that
i
want
to
know
where
he
got
the
book
take
the
book
along
to
show
you
are
the
real
goods
when
he
tells
you
where
then
find
that
person
if
you
can
and
ask
him
the
same
question
keep
going
until
you
discover
something
you
may
have
to
hunt
up
a
half
dozen
former
owners
but
sooner
or
later
you
will
come
to
an
end
to
the
place
where
that
book
crossed
the
sea
and
unless
i
miss
my
guess
that
mighty
important
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
send
you
wish
i
could
go
myself
he
said
after
a
moment
silence
it
will
be
an
interesting
hunt
and
may
even
be
a
trifle
dangerous
though
i
think
not
but
this
money
this
hundred
dollars
lucile
hesitated
fingering
the
bills
oh
that
he
smiled
that
the
last
of
my
profit
on
the
little
book
we
call
that
devoted
to
the
cause
of
science
or
lost
books
or
whatever
you
like
but
he
called
after
her
as
she
left
the
shop
be
sure
to
keep
your
fingers
tight
closed
around
the
little
book
this
lucile
was
destined
to
discover
was
not
so
easily
done
chapter
xix
lucile
solves
no
mystery
buried
deep
beneath
the
blankets
of
lower
car
bound
for
new
york
lucile
for
a
time
that
night
allowed
her
thoughts
to
swing
along
with
the
roll
of
the
century
limited
she
found
herself
puzzled
at
the
unexpected
turn
of
events
she
had
never
visited
new
york
and
she
welcomed
the
opportunity
there
was
more
to
be
learned
by
such
a
visit
brief
though
it
was
bound
to
be
than
in
a
whole
month
of
poring
over
books
but
why
was
she
going
what
did
frank
morrow
hope
to
prove
by
any
discoveries
she
might
make
regarding
the
former
ownership
of
the
book
she
carried
in
her
pocket
she
had
never
doubted
but
that
the
aged
frenchman
when
badly
in
need
of
funds
had
sold
the
book
to
some
american
that
he
should
have
repented
of
the
transaction
and
had
wished
the
book
back
in
his
library
seemed
natural
enough
lacking
funds
to
purchase
it
back
he
had
found
another
way
that
the
ends
justified
the
means
lucile
very
much
doubted
yet
there
was
something
to
be
said
for
this
old
man
because
of
his
extreme
age
it
might
be
that
he
had
reached
the
period
of
his
second
childhood
and
all
things
appeared
to
belong
to
him
but
here
she
told
herself
rising
to
a
sitting
posture
and
trying
to
stare
out
into
the
fleeing
darkness
here
we
suddenly
discover
that
the
book
came
from
new
york
what
is
one
to
make
of
that
very
simple
in
a
way
i
suppose
this
aged
frenchman
enters
america
by
way
of
new
york
he
needs
funds
to
pay
his
passage
and
the
freight
on
his
books
to
chicago
so
he
sells
one
or
two
books
to
procure
the
money
yet
i
doubt
if
that
would
be
frank
morrow
solution
of
the
problem
surely
he
would
not
sacrifice
a
hundred
dollars
to
send
me
to
new
york
merely
to
find
out
who
the
man
was
to
whom
the
old
frenchman
had
sold
the
book
he
must
think
there
is
more
to
it
than
that
and
perhaps
there
is
ho
well
she
sighed
as
she
settled
back
on
her
pillow
let
that
come
when
it
comes
i
am
going
to
see
new
york
she
spelled
it
out
and
that
is
a
grand
and
glorious
privilege
the
next
moment
the
swing
of
the
century
limited
as
it
over
the
rails
and
the
onward
rush
of
scenery
meant
nothing
to
her
she
was
fast
asleep
morning
found
her
much
refreshed
after
a
half
hour
in
the
washroom
and
another
in
the
diner
over
coffee
and
toast
she
felt
equal
to
the
facing
of
any
events
which
might
chance
to
cross
her
path
that
day
there
are
days
in
all
our
lives
that
are
but
blanks
they
pass
and
we
forget
them
forever
there
are
other
days
that
are
so
pressed
full
and
running
over
with
vivid
experience
that
every
hour
as
we
look
back
upon
it
seems
a
crowded
hour
such
days
we
never
forget
and
this
was
destined
to
be
such
a
day
in
the
life
of
lucile
precisely
at
nine
she
was
at
the
door
of
burtnoe
book
store
to
save
time
she
had
taken
a
taxi
the
clerk
who
unfastened
the
door
looked
at
her
curiously
when
she
asked
for
roderick
vining
she
was
directed
by
a
nod
to
the
back
corner
of
the
room
she
made
her
way
into
a
square
alcove
where
an
electric
light
shining
brightly
from
the
ceiling
brought
out
a
gleam
of
real
gold
from
the
backs
of
thousands
of
books
done
in
fine
bindings
bending
over
a
desk
telephone
was
the
form
of
a
tall
man
are
are
you
roderick
vining
she
faltered
at
the
same
time
drawing
the
compleat
angler
half
out
of
her
pocket
his
only
answer
was
to
hold
up
one
long
tapering
finger
as
a
signal
for
silence
someone
was
speaking
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
with
burning
cheeks
and
a
whispered
apology
the
girl
sank
back
into
the
shadows
her
courage
faltered
this
was
her
introduction
to
new
york
she
had
made
a
faux
pas
as
her
first
move
and
this
man
roderick
vining
was
no
ordinary
person
she
could
see
that
there
was
time
to
study
him
now
his
face
was
long
his
features
thin
but
his
forehead
was
high
he
impressed
her
seated
though
he
was
as
one
who
was
habitually
in
a
hurry
pressing
matters
were
without
doubt
constantly
upon
his
mind
now
he
was
speaking
she
could
not
avoid
hearing
what
he
was
saying
without
leaving
the
alcove
and
he
had
not
requested
her
to
do
that
why
yes
nelson
he
was
saying
we
can
get
the
set
for
you
of
course
you
understand
that
is
a
very
special
de
luxe
edition
only
three
hundred
sets
struck
off
then
the
plates
destroyed
the
cost
would
be
considerable
again
he
pressed
the
receiver
to
his
ear
why
i
should
say
three
thousand
dollars
not
less
certainly
all
right
madam
i
will
order
the
set
at
once
your
address
yes
certainly
i
have
it
thank
you
he
placed
the
receiver
on
its
hook
with
as
little
noise
as
if
it
had
been
padded
then
turned
to
lucile
pardon
me
you
wanted
to
see
me
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
frank
morrow
sent
me
here
to
ask
you
where
you
purchased
this
book
she
held
the
thin
volume
out
for
his
inspection
he
did
not
appear
to
look
at
it
at
all
instead
he
looked
her
squarely
in
the
eye
frank
morrow
sent
you
all
the
way
from
chicago
that
you
might
ask
me
that
question
how
extraordinary
why
did
he
not
wire
me
he
knows
i
would
tell
him
a
slight
frown
appeared
on
his
forehead
i
i
am
she
was
about
to
tell
him
that
she
was
to
ask
the
next
person
where
he
got
it
but
thinking
better
of
it
said
instead
that
is
only
part
of
my
mission
to
new
york
wo
you
please
look
at
the
book
and
answer
my
question
still
he
did
not
look
at
the
book
but
to
her
utter
astonishment
said
while
a
smile
illumined
his
face
i
bought
that
copy
of
compleat
angler
right
here
in
this
alcove
from
whom
she
half
whispered
from
old
dan
whitner
who
keeps
a
bookshop
back
on
walton
place
thank
you
she
murmured
much
relieved
here
was
no
mystery
one
bookshop
selling
a
book
to
another
there
was
more
to
it
she
must
follow
on
i
suppose
he
smiled
as
if
reading
her
thoughts
that
you
like
me
to
tell
you
where
dan
got
it
but
that
i
can
not
answer
you
must
ask
him
yourself
his
address
is
walton
place
it
is
ten
minutes
walk
from
here
three
blocks
to
your
right
as
you
leave
our
door
then
two
to
your
left
a
block
and
a
half
to
your
left
again
and
you
are
there
the
easy
to
read
just
whitner
books
dan
a
prince
of
a
chap
do
anything
for
a
girl
like
you
would
for
anyone
for
that
matter
ever
been
to
new
york
before
he
asked
suddenly
no
come
alone
yes
he
whistled
softly
to
himself
you
western
girls
will
be
the
death
of
us
when
there
some
place
that
needs
to
be
gone
to
we
go
to
it
she
smiled
half
defiantly
there
nothing
so
terrible
about
that
is
there
no
i
suppose
not
he
admitted
well
you
go
see
dan
he
tell
you
anything
he
knows
with
that
he
turned
to
his
work
lucile
however
was
not
ready
to
go
she
had
one
more
question
to
ask
even
though
it
might
be
another
faux
pas
would
you
would
you
mind
telling
me
how
you
knew
what
book
i
had
when
you
did
not
see
it
she
said
i
did
see
it
he
smiled
as
if
amused
i
did
see
it
when
you
expected
me
to
see
it
that
was
all
i
saw
it
long
before
saw
it
when
i
was
at
the
phone
it
a
habit
we
book
folks
have
of
doing
one
thing
with
our
ears
and
another
with
our
eyes
we
have
to
or
we
never
get
through
in
a
day
if
we
did
your
little
book
protruded
from
your
pocket
i
knew
you
were
going
to
say
something
about
it
perhaps
offer
to
sell
it
so
i
looked
at
it
simple
was
it
no
great
mystery
about
it
hope
your
other
mysteries
will
prove
as
simple
got
any
friends
in
new
york
no
he
shook
his
head
in
a
puzzled
manner
but
allowed
her
to
leave
the
room
without
further
comment
chapter
xx
that
was
the
man
dan
whitner
was
a
somewhat
shabby
likeness
of
roderick
vining
that
is
he
was
a
man
who
knew
a
great
deal
about
books
his
shelves
were
dusty
so
too
was
a
jacket
yes
he
remembered
the
book
quite
well
lucile
began
to
get
the
notion
that
once
one
of
these
book
wizards
set
eyes
upon
an
ancient
volume
he
never
forgot
it
strange
case
that
smiled
dan
as
he
looked
at
her
over
his
glasses
ah
here
is
where
i
learn
something
of
real
importance
was
the
mental
comment
you
see
dan
went
on
i
sometimes
have
dinner
with
a
very
good
friend
who
also
loves
books
the
reverend
edward
edwards
dinner
on
such
occasions
is
served
on
a
in
his
library
sort
of
makes
a
fellow
feel
at
home
do
you
know
well
one
of
these
evenings
when
the
good
doctor
had
an
exceptional
roast
of
mutton
and
a
hubbard
squash
just
in
from
the
farm
and
a
wee
bit
of
something
beside
he
had
me
over
while
we
waited
to
be
served
i
was
glancing
over
his
books
and
chanced
to
note
the
book
you
now
have
in
your
hand
see
i
said
to
him
jokingly
you
have
come
into
a
legacy
no
he
says
looking
up
surprised
should
you
think
that
i
pointed
to
this
little
copy
of
compleat
angler
and
said
them
as
are
very
rich
can
afford
to
possess
such
as
this
one
he
looked
at
me
in
surprise
then
smiled
as
he
said
did
pay
a
little
too
much
for
it
i
guess
but
the
print
was
rather
unusual
besides
a
great
book
i
do
mind
admitting
that
it
cost
me
fifteen
dollars
dollars
i
exploded
trimmed
did
i
he
smiled
back
you
know
the
old
saying
about
the
clergy
no
business
heads
on
them
so
we
let
it
stand
at
that
nothing
i
fairly
yelled
book
a
small
fortune
in
itself
one
of
those
rare
finds
why
i
venture
to
risk
six
hundred
dollars
on
it
myself
without
opening
the
covers
of
it
it
a
first
edition
or
i
not
a
book
seller
at
all
he
cried
in
high
glee
are
three
families
in
my
parish
who
are
in
dire
need
this
book
was
sent
no
doubt
to
assist
me
in
tiding
them
over
so
that
how
i
came
into
possession
of
the
book
i
sold
it
to
vining
at
burtnoe
as
you
no
doubt
know
but
exclaimed
lucile
breathlessly
feeling
that
the
scent
was
growing
fresher
all
the
while
from
whom
did
the
doctor
purchase
it
at
so
ridiculous
a
price
from
a
fool
bookstorekeeper
of
course
one
of
those
upstarts
who
know
nothing
at
all
about
books
who
handle
them
as
pure
merchandise
purchased
at
so
much
and
sold
for
forty
and
five
per
cent
more
regardless
of
actual
value
he
bought
it
to
help
out
some
ignorant
foreigner
a
spaniard
i
believe
he
paid
ten
dollars
and
had
been
terribly
pleased
within
himself
when
he
made
five
on
the
deal
who
was
he
lucile
asked
eagerly
and
where
was
his
shop
that
i
did
trouble
to
find
out
very
likely
he
out
of
business
by
now
such
shops
are
like
grass
in
autumn
soon
die
down
and
the
snow
covers
them
up
the
doctor
could
tell
you
though
i
give
you
his
address
and
you
may
go
and
ask
him
the
short
afternoon
was
near
spent
and
the
shades
of
night
were
already
falling
when
at
last
lucile
entered
the
shop
of
the
unfortunate
bookseller
who
had
not
realized
the
value
of
the
little
book
lunch
had
delayed
her
then
the
doctor
had
been
out
making
calls
and
had
kept
her
waiting
for
two
hours
the
little
shop
had
been
hard
to
find
but
here
at
last
she
was
a
pitiful
shop
it
was
possessing
but
a
few
hundred
volumes
and
presided
over
by
a
man
who
might
but
the
day
before
have
been
promoted
from
the
garbage
wagon
so
far
as
personal
appearance
was
concerned
indeed
as
lucile
looked
over
the
place
she
was
seized
with
the
crazy
notion
that
the
whole
place
books
shelves
and
proprietor
had
but
recently
climbed
down
from
the
junk
cart
and
yet
she
told
herself
it
was
from
this
very
heap
of
dusty
paper
and
cardboard
that
this
precious
bit
of
literature
which
i
have
in
my
pocket
was
salvaged
i
must
not
forget
that
i
believe
she
told
herself
with
an
excited
intake
of
breath
that
i
am
coming
close
to
the
end
of
my
search
all
day
i
have
been
descending
step
by
step
first
the
wonderful
burtnoe
book
store
with
all
its
magnificence
and
its
genius
of
a
bookman
then
dan
whitner
and
the
doctor
now
this
place
and
then
perhaps
whoever
the
person
is
who
sold
the
book
to
this
pitiful
specimen
of
a
bookseller
her
heart
skipped
a
beat
as
the
bookman
having
caught
sight
of
her
began
to
amble
in
her
direction
she
made
her
question
short
and
to
the
point
where
did
you
get
this
book
that
book
he
took
it
and
turned
it
over
in
his
hand
he
scratched
his
head
that
why
that
book
must
have
been
one
i
bought
with
a
lot
at
an
auction
sale
last
week
buy
it
no
no
exclaimed
lucile
seizing
the
book
it
not
your
book
it
is
mine
but
you
had
it
once
and
sold
it
what
i
wish
to
know
is
where
did
you
get
it
three
customers
were
thumbing
through
the
books
one
seated
at
a
table
turned
and
looked
up
his
face
impressed
the
girl
at
once
as
being
particularly
horrible
dark
featured
with
a
blue
birthmark
covering
half
his
chin
he
inspired
her
with
an
almost
uncontrollable
fear
we
we
she
faltered
may
we
not
step
back
under
the
light
where
you
can
see
the
book
better
the
shopkeeper
followed
her
in
stolid
silence
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
tell
him
the
whole
story
of
the
purchase
and
sale
of
the
book
before
he
recognized
it
as
having
once
been
on
his
shelves
oh
yes
he
exclaimed
at
last
made
five
dollars
on
her
thought
i
had
made
a
mistake
but
did
not
that
time
i
did
where
i
get
her
let
see
as
he
stood
there
attempting
to
recall
the
name
of
the
purchaser
lucile
gaze
strayed
to
an
opening
between
two
rows
of
books
instantly
her
eyes
were
caught
as
a
bird
by
a
serpent
as
she
found
herself
looking
into
a
pair
of
cruel
crafty
prying
eyes
they
vanished
instantly
but
left
her
with
a
cold
chill
running
up
her
spine
it
was
the
man
who
had
been
seated
at
the
table
but
why
had
he
been
spying
she
had
not
long
to
wait
before
a
possible
solution
was
given
her
i
know
exclaimed
the
shopkeeper
at
this
instant
i
bought
it
from
a
foreigner
bought
two
others
from
him
too
made
good
money
on
all
too
why
he
exclaimed
suddenly
he
was
in
here
when
you
came
had
another
book
under
his
arm
he
did
wanted
to
sell
it
i
judge
i
was
just
keeping
him
waiting
a
little
so
he
would
think
i
wanted
it
too
bad
if
they
think
you
want
their
books
bad
they
stick
for
a
big
price
his
voice
had
dropped
to
a
whisper
his
eyes
had
narrowed
to
what
was
meant
to
be
a
very
expression
may
be
here
yet
he
darted
around
the
stand
of
books
that
him
just
going
out
the
door
hey
you
he
shouted
after
the
man
paying
not
the
least
attention
the
person
passed
out
slamming
the
door
after
him
passing
rapidly
down
the
room
the
proprietor
poked
his
head
out
of
the
door
and
shouted
twice
after
listening
for
a
moment
he
backed
into
the
room
and
shut
the
door
gone
he
muttered
worse
luck
to
me
sometimes
we
wait
too
long
and
sometimes
not
long
enough
now
some
other
lucky
dog
will
get
that
book
in
the
meantime
lucile
had
glanced
about
the
shop
two
persons
were
reading
beneath
a
lamp
in
the
corner
neither
was
the
man
with
the
birthmark
it
was
natural
enough
to
conclude
that
it
was
he
who
had
left
the
room
did
he
have
a
birthmark
on
his
chin
this
man
you
bought
the
book
from
she
asked
as
the
proprietor
returned
yes
he
did
then
i
saw
him
here
a
moment
ago
when
is
he
likely
to
return
that
no
one
can
tell
perhaps
perhaps
never
he
has
not
been
here
before
in
three
months
did
you
wish
to
speak
with
him
lucile
shivered
well
perhaps
not
she
half
whispered
huh
grunted
the
proprietor
suddenly
what
this
must
be
the
book
he
brought
he
forgotten
it
now
he
is
sure
to
be
back
lucile
was
rather
of
the
opinion
that
he
would
not
soon
return
she
believed
that
there
had
been
some
trickery
about
the
affair
of
these
valuable
books
which
were
being
sold
to
the
cheapest
book
dealer
in
the
city
for
a
very
small
part
of
their
value
perhaps
they
were
stolen
she
told
herself
at
once
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
came
to
her
here
she
was
with
a
book
in
her
possession
which
had
been
but
recently
stolen
from
frank
morrow
book
shop
by
a
girl
and
now
circumstances
seemed
to
indicate
that
this
very
book
had
been
stolen
by
some
person
who
had
sold
it
to
this
bookmonger
who
had
passed
it
on
to
the
doctor
who
had
sold
it
to
dan
whitner
who
had
sold
it
to
roderick
vining
who
had
sold
it
to
frank
morrow
sounds
like
the
house
that
jack
built
she
whispered
to
herself
but
then
i
suppose
some
valuable
books
have
been
stolen
many
times
frank
morrow
said
one
of
his
had
been
stolen
twice
within
a
week
by
totally
different
persons
turning
to
the
shopkeeper
she
asked
if
she
might
see
the
book
that
had
been
left
behind
as
she
turned
back
the
cover
a
low
exclamation
escaped
her
lips
in
the
corner
of
that
cover
was
the
same
secret
mark
as
had
been
in
all
the
mystery
books
the
gargoyle
and
the
letter
hiding
her
surprise
as
best
she
could
she
handed
the
book
to
the
man
with
the
remark
of
course
you
can
not
sell
the
book
since
it
is
not
your
own
i
chance
it
i
give
you
ten
dollars
for
it
if
he
returns
and
demands
more
i
will
either
pay
the
price
or
return
the
book
i
give
you
my
address
done
he
exclaimed
i
do
think
you
ever
hear
from
me
i
give
him
seven
and
he
be
glad
enough
to
get
it
pretty
good
eh
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
gleefully
three
dollars
clean
profit
and
not
a
cent
invested
any
of
the
time
like
the
ancient
volume
on
fishing
this
newly
acquired
book
was
small
and
thin
so
without
examining
its
contents
she
thrust
it
beside
the
other
in
the
large
pocket
of
her
coat
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
done
it
she
whispered
to
herself
as
she
left
the
shop
but
if
i
had
he
have
sold
it
to
the
first
customer
it
evidence
in
the
case
and
besides
it
may
be
valuable
a
fog
hung
over
the
city
the
streets
were
dark
and
damp
here
and
there
a
yellow
light
struggled
to
pierce
the
denseness
of
the
gloom
as
she
turned
to
the
right
and
walked
down
the
street
not
knowing
for
the
moment
quite
what
else
to
do
she
fancied
that
a
shadow
darted
down
the
alley
to
her
left
too
dark
to
tell
might
have
been
a
dog
or
anything
she
murmured
yet
she
shivered
and
quickened
her
pace
she
was
in
a
great
dark
city
alone
and
she
was
going
where
that
she
did
not
know
the
day
adventures
had
left
her
high
and
dry
on
the
streets
of
a
city
as
a
boat
is
left
by
the
tide
on
the
sand
chapter
xxi
a
theft
in
the
night
there
is
no
feeling
of
desolation
so
complete
as
that
which
sweeps
over
one
who
is
utterly
alone
in
a
great
city
at
night
the
desert
the
arctic
wilderness
the
heart
of
the
forest
the
boundless
sea
all
these
have
their
terrors
but
for
downright
desolation
give
me
the
heart
of
a
strange
city
at
night
hardly
had
lucile
covered
two
blocks
on
her
journey
from
the
book
shop
when
this
feeling
of
utter
loneliness
engulfed
her
like
a
bank
of
fog
shuddering
she
paused
to
consider
and
as
she
did
so
fancied
she
caught
the
bulk
of
a
shadow
disappearing
into
a
doorway
to
the
right
of
her
where
am
i
and
where
am
i
to
go
she
asked
herself
in
a
wild
attempt
to
gather
her
scattered
senses
in
vain
she
endeavored
to
recall
the
name
of
the
street
she
was
on
at
that
moment
her
efforts
to
recall
the
route
she
had
taken
in
getting
there
were
quite
as
futile
wish
i
were
in
chicago
she
breathed
the
very
worst
of
it
is
better
than
this
there
at
least
i
have
friends
somewhere
here
i
have
none
anywhere
wish
florence
were
here
at
that
she
caught
herself
up
there
was
no
use
in
wishing
for
things
that
could
not
be
the
question
was
what
did
she
intend
to
do
was
she
to
seek
out
a
hotel
and
spend
the
night
there
to
resume
her
search
for
the
first
person
in
america
who
had
sold
the
ancient
copy
of
the
angler
or
was
she
to
take
the
first
train
back
to
chicago
she
had
a
feeling
that
she
had
seen
the
man
she
sought
and
that
weeks
of
search
might
not
reveal
him
again
yet
she
disliked
going
back
to
frank
morrow
with
so
little
to
show
for
his
hundred
dollars
invested
anyway
she
said
at
last
with
a
shudder
i
got
to
get
out
of
here
boo
it
seems
like
the
very
depths
of
the
slums
she
started
on
at
a
brisk
pace
having
gone
a
half
block
she
faced
about
suddenly
she
fancied
she
heard
footsteps
behind
her
she
saw
nothing
but
an
empty
street
nerves
she
told
herself
i
got
to
get
over
that
i
know
what
the
matter
with
me
though
i
have
eaten
for
hours
i
find
a
restaurant
pretty
soon
and
get
a
cup
of
coffee
there
is
a
strange
thing
about
our
great
cities
in
certain
sections
you
may
pass
a
half
dozen
coffee
shops
and
at
least
three
policemen
in
a
single
block
in
other
sections
you
may
go
an
entire
mile
without
seeing
either
evidently
eating
places
like
policemen
crave
company
of
their
own
kind
lucile
had
happened
upon
a
policeless
and
section
of
new
york
for
a
full
twenty
minutes
she
tramped
on
through
the
fog
growing
more
and
more
certain
at
every
step
that
she
was
being
followed
by
someone
and
not
coming
upon
a
single
person
or
shop
that
offered
her
either
food
or
protection
suddenly
she
found
herself
in
the
midst
of
a
throng
of
people
a
movie
theater
had
disgorged
this
throng
like
a
sudden
flood
of
water
they
surrounded
her
and
bore
her
on
they
poured
down
the
street
to
break
up
into
two
smaller
streams
one
of
which
flowed
on
down
the
street
and
the
other
into
a
hole
in
the
ground
having
been
caught
in
the
latter
stream
and
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
eager
for
companionship
of
whatever
sort
the
girl
allowed
herself
to
be
borne
along
and
down
into
the
hole
down
a
steep
flight
of
steps
she
was
half
carried
to
be
at
last
deposited
on
a
platform
alongside
of
which
in
due
time
a
train
of
electric
cars
came
rattling
in
the
subway
she
breathed
it
will
take
me
anywhere
providing
i
know
where
i
want
to
go
just
as
she
was
beginning
to
experience
a
sense
of
relief
from
contact
with
this
flowing
mass
of
humanity
she
was
given
a
sudden
shock
to
the
right
of
her
through
a
narrow
gap
in
the
throng
she
recognized
a
face
the
gap
closed
up
at
once
and
the
face
disappeared
but
the
image
of
it
remained
it
was
the
face
of
the
man
she
had
seen
in
the
shop
he
of
the
birthmark
on
his
chin
no
doubt
of
it
now
she
said
half
aloud
he
following
me
then
like
some
hunted
creature
of
the
wild
she
began
looking
about
her
for
a
way
of
escape
before
her
there
whizzed
a
train
the
moving
cars
came
to
a
halt
a
door
slid
open
she
leaped
within
the
next
instant
the
door
closed
and
she
was
borne
away
to
what
place
she
could
not
tell
all
she
knew
was
that
she
was
on
her
way
quite
confident
that
she
had
evaded
her
pursuer
she
settled
back
in
her
seat
to
fall
into
a
drowsy
stupor
how
far
she
rode
she
could
not
tell
having
at
last
been
roused
to
action
by
the
pangs
of
hunger
she
rose
and
left
the
car
only
hope
there
is
some
place
to
eat
near
she
sighed
again
she
found
herself
lost
in
a
jam
the
legitimate
theaters
were
disgorging
their
crowds
she
was
at
this
time
though
she
did
not
know
it
in
the
down
town
district
her
right
hand
was
disengaged
in
her
left
she
carried
a
small
leather
bag
as
she
struggled
through
the
throng
she
experienced
difficulty
in
retaining
her
hold
on
this
bag
of
a
sudden
she
felt
a
mighty
wrench
on
its
handle
and
the
next
instant
it
was
gone
there
could
be
no
mistaking
that
sudden
pull
it
had
been
torn
from
her
grasp
by
a
vandal
of
some
sort
as
she
turned
with
a
gasp
she
caught
sight
of
a
face
that
vanished
instantly
the
face
of
the
man
with
the
birthmark
on
his
chin
instantly
the
whole
situation
flashed
through
her
mind
this
man
had
been
following
her
to
regain
possession
of
one
or
both
of
the
books
which
at
this
moment
reposed
in
her
coat
pocket
he
had
made
the
mistake
of
thinking
these
books
were
in
the
bag
he
would
search
the
bag
and
then
she
reasoned
no
further
a
car
door
was
about
to
close
she
dashed
through
it
at
imminent
risk
of
being
caught
in
the
crush
of
its
swing
and
the
next
instant
the
car
whirled
away
missed
him
that
time
she
breathed
he
will
search
the
bag
when
he
discovers
his
mistake
it
will
be
too
late
the
bird
has
flown
as
to
the
bag
he
may
keep
it
it
contains
only
a
bit
of
a
pink
garment
which
i
can
afford
to
do
without
and
two
clean
handkerchiefs
fifteen
minutes
later
when
she
left
the
car
she
found
herself
in
a
very
much
calmer
state
of
mind
convinced
that
she
had
shaken
herself
free
from
her
undesirable
shadow
and
fully
convinced
also
that
nothing
now
remained
but
to
eat
a
belated
supper
and
board
the
next
train
for
her
home
city
she
went
about
the
business
of
finding
out
what
that
next
train
might
be
and
from
what
depot
it
left
fortunately
a
hotel
office
was
able
to
furnish
her
the
information
needed
and
to
call
a
taxi
a
half
hour
later
she
found
herself
enjoying
a
hot
lunch
in
the
depot
and
at
the
same
time
mentally
reveling
in
the
soft
comfort
of
lower
of
car
which
she
was
soon
to
occupy
chapter
xxii
many
mysteries
one
might
have
supposed
that
considering
she
was
now
late
into
the
night
of
the
most
exacting
and
exciting
day
of
her
whole
life
lucile
once
she
was
safely
stowed
away
in
her
berth
on
the
train
would
immediately
fall
asleep
this
however
was
not
the
case
her
active
brain
was
still
at
work
still
struggling
to
untangle
the
many
mysteries
that
during
the
past
weeks
had
woven
themselves
into
what
seemed
an
inseparable
tangle
so
after
a
half
hour
of
vain
attempt
to
sleep
she
sat
bolt
upright
in
her
berth
and
snapped
on
the
light
prepared
if
need
be
to
spend
the
few
remaining
hours
of
that
night
satisfying
the
demands
of
that
irreconcilable
mind
of
hers
the
train
had
already
started
the
heavy
green
curtains
which
hid
her
from
the
little
outside
world
about
her
waved
gently
to
and
fro
her
white
arms
and
shoulders
gleamed
in
the
light
her
hair
hung
tumbled
in
a
mass
about
her
as
the
train
took
a
curve
she
was
swung
against
the
hammock
in
which
her
heavy
coat
rested
her
bare
shoulder
touched
something
hard
the
books
she
said
wonder
what
my
new
acquirement
is
like
she
drew
the
new
book
from
her
pocket
and
brushing
her
hair
out
of
her
eyes
scanned
it
curiously
french
she
whispered
very
old
french
and
hard
to
read
as
she
thumbed
the
pages
she
saw
quaint
woodcuts
of
soldiers
and
officers
here
was
a
single
officer
seated
impressively
upon
a
horse
here
a
group
of
soldiers
scanning
the
horizon
and
there
a
whole
battalion
charging
a
very
ancient
fieldpiece
something
about
war
she
told
herself
that
about
all
i
can
make
out
she
was
ready
to
close
the
book
when
her
eye
was
caught
by
an
inscription
written
upon
the
fly
leaf
looks
sort
of
distinguished
she
told
herself
should
wonder
if
the
book
were
valuable
because
of
that
writing
if
for
nothing
else
in
this
surmise
she
was
more
right
than
she
knew
she
put
the
book
carefully
away
but
was
unable
to
banish
the
questions
which
the
sight
of
it
had
brought
up
automatically
her
mind
went
over
the
incidents
which
had
led
up
to
this
precise
moment
she
saw
the
child
in
the
university
library
saw
her
take
down
the
book
and
flee
saw
her
later
in
the
mystery
cottage
on
tyler
street
she
fought
again
the
battle
with
the
hardened
foster
mother
of
the
child
and
again
endured
the
torturing
moments
in
that
evil
woman
abode
she
thought
of
the
mysterious
person
who
had
followed
her
and
had
saved
her
from
unknown
terrors
by
notifying
the
police
had
that
person
been
the
same
as
he
who
had
followed
her
this
very
night
in
an
attempt
to
regain
possession
of
the
two
books
no
surely
not
she
could
not
conceive
of
his
doing
her
an
act
of
kindness
she
thought
of
the
person
who
had
followed
them
to
the
wall
of
the
summer
cottage
out
at
the
dunes
and
wondered
vaguely
if
he
could
have
been
the
same
person
who
had
followed
them
on
tyler
street
at
one
time
and
at
that
other
saved
her
from
the
clutches
of
the
foster
parents
she
wondered
who
he
could
be
was
he
a
detective
who
had
been
set
to
dog
her
trail
or
was
he
some
friend
the
latter
seemed
impossible
if
he
was
a
detective
how
had
she
escaped
him
on
this
trip
or
after
all
had
she
it
gave
her
a
little
thrill
to
think
that
perhaps
in
the
excitement
of
the
day
his
presence
near
her
had
not
been
noticed
and
that
he
might
at
this
very
moment
be
traveling
with
her
in
this
car
involuntarily
she
seized
the
green
curtains
and
tried
to
button
them
more
tightly
then
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
at
herself
but
how
she
asked
herself
is
all
this
tangle
to
be
straightened
out
take
that
one
little
book
compleat
angler
the
child
apparently
stole
it
from
frank
morrow
i
have
it
from
her
by
a
mere
accident
frank
morrow
has
it
from
one
new
york
book
shop
that
shop
from
another
the
other
from
a
theologian
he
from
a
third
book
shop
and
that
shop
more
than
likely
from
a
thief
for
if
he
would
attempt
to
steal
it
from
me
he
more
than
likely
stole
it
in
the
first
place
and
was
attempting
to
get
it
from
me
to
destroy
my
evidence
against
him
now
if
the
book
was
stolen
in
the
first
place
and
all
of
us
have
had
stolen
property
in
our
possession
in
the
form
of
this
book
what
going
to
happen
to
the
bunch
of
us
and
how
are
we
ever
to
square
ourselves
last
of
all
she
smiled
where
does
our
friend
the
aged
frenchman
the
godfather
of
that
precious
child
come
in
on
it
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
secret
mark
with
all
these
problems
stated
and
none
of
them
solved
she
at
last
found
a
drowsy
sensation
about
to
overcome
her
so
settling
back
upon
her
pillow
and
drawing
the
blankets
about
her
she
allowed
herself
to
drift
off
into
slumber
the
train
she
had
taken
was
not
as
speedy
as
the
one
which
had
taken
her
to
new
york
darkness
of
another
day
had
fallen
when
at
last
she
recognized
the
welcome
sound
of
the
train
rumbling
over
hollow
spaces
at
regular
intervals
and
knew
that
she
was
passing
over
the
streets
of
her
own
city
florence
would
be
there
to
meet
her
lucile
had
wired
her
the
time
of
her
arrival
it
certainly
would
seem
good
to
meet
someone
she
knew
once
more
as
the
train
at
last
rattled
into
the
heart
of
the
city
she
caught
an
unusual
red
glow
against
the
sky
fire
somewhere
she
told
herself
without
giving
it
much
thought
for
in
a
city
of
millions
one
thinks
little
of
a
single
blaze
it
was
only
after
she
and
florence
had
left
the
depot
that
she
noted
again
that
red
glow
with
a
start
the
first
indication
that
something
unusual
was
happening
in
that
section
of
the
city
was
the
large
amount
of
traffic
which
passed
the
street
car
they
had
taken
automobiles
trucks
and
delivery
cars
rattled
rapidly
past
them
that
strange
she
told
herself
the
street
is
usually
deserted
at
this
time
of
night
i
wonder
if
the
fire
could
be
over
this
way
but
surely
it
would
be
out
by
now
at
last
the
traffic
became
so
crowded
that
their
car
like
a
bit
of
debris
in
a
clogged
stream
was
caught
and
held
in
the
middle
of
it
all
what
the
trouble
she
asked
the
conductor
bad
fire
up
ahead
just
across
the
river
across
the
river
why
that
where
tyler
street
is
yes
in
that
direction
come
on
she
said
seizing
florence
by
the
arm
the
fire
down
toward
tyler
street
i
think
we
ought
to
try
to
get
to
the
cottage
if
we
can
what
could
that
child
and
the
old
frenchman
do
if
the
fire
reached
their
cottage
he
burn
rather
than
leave
his
books
and
the
child
leave
him
besides
there
are
the
books
that
belong
to
other
people
and
that
i
partly
responsible
for
for
fifteen
minutes
they
struggled
down
a
street
that
was
thronged
with
excited
people
one
would
believe
that
there
could
be
such
a
crowd
on
the
streets
at
this
hour
of
the
night
panted
florence
as
she
elbowed
her
way
forward
lucile
you
hang
to
my
waist
we
must
not
be
separated
they
came
to
a
dead
stop
at
last
at
the
end
of
the
river
bridge
a
rope
had
been
thrown
across
the
street
at
paces
of
ten
feet
this
rope
was
guarded
by
policemen
none
could
pass
save
the
firemen
the
fire
was
across
the
river
but
sent
forth
a
red
glare
that
was
startling
by
dint
of
ten
minutes
of
crawling
florence
succeeded
in
securing
for
them
a
position
against
the
rope
a
large
fire
in
a
city
at
night
is
a
grand
and
terrible
spectacle
this
fire
was
no
exception
indeed
it
was
destined
to
become
the
worst
fire
the
city
had
experienced
in
more
than
forty
years
starting
in
some
low
ancient
structures
that
lay
along
the
river
it
soon
climbed
to
a
series
of
brick
buildings
occupied
by
garment
makers
the
flames
like
red
dragons
tongues
darted
in
and
out
of
windows
with
a
great
burst
they
leaped
through
a
roof
to
mount
hundreds
of
feet
in
air
burning
fragments
all
ablaze
leaped
to
soar
away
in
the
hot
currents
of
air
the
firemen
all
but
powerless
fought
bravely
here
a
fire
tower
reared
itself
to
dizzy
heights
in
air
here
and
there
fire
hose
like
a
thousand
entwined
serpents
writhed
and
twisted
here
a
whole
battery
of
fire
engines
smoked
and
there
two
powerful
gasoline
driven
engines
kept
up
a
constant
heavy
throbbing
roofs
and
walls
crumbled
water
tanks
tottered
and
fell
steel
pillars
writhed
and
twisted
in
the
intense
heat
chimneys
came
crashing
in
heaps
the
fire
had
all
but
consumed
the
row
of
buildings
then
with
a
fresh
dash
of
air
from
the
lake
it
burst
forth
in
earnest
a
real
and
terrible
conflagration
lucile
as
she
stood
there
watching
it
felt
a
thousand
hitherto
unexperienced
emotions
sweep
over
her
but
at
last
she
came
to
rest
with
one
terrible
fact
bearing
down
upon
her
very
soul
tyler
street
was
just
beyond
this
conflagration
who
could
tell
when
the
fire
would
reach
the
mysterious
cottage
with
its
aged
occupant
she
thought
of
something
else
of
the
books
she
might
long
since
have
returned
to
their
rightful
owners
and
had
not
now
they
will
burn
and
i
will
never
be
able
to
explain
she
told
herself
somehow
i
must
get
through
in
her
excitement
she
lifted
the
rope
and
started
forward
a
heavy
hand
was
instantly
laid
on
her
shoulders
y
ca
go
over
there
i
must
y
ca
the
policeman
thrust
her
gently
back
behind
the
rope
and
drew
it
down
before
her
i
must
go
she
told
herself
oh
i
must
i
must
chapter
xxiii
inside
the
lines
come
on
lucile
said
pulling
at
florence
arm
we
got
to
get
there
it
must
be
done
for
everything
that
must
be
done
there
is
always
a
way
they
crowded
their
way
back
through
the
throng
which
was
hourly
growing
denser
it
was
distressing
to
catch
the
fragments
of
conversation
that
came
to
them
as
they
fought
their
way
back
tens
of
thousands
of
people
were
being
robbed
of
their
means
of
making
a
living
each
fresh
blaze
took
the
bread
from
the
mouths
of
hundreds
of
children
much
of
a
job
i
had
muttered
an
irish
mother
with
a
shawl
over
her
head
but
it
was
bread
bread
every
paper
every
record
of
my
business
for
the
past
ten
years
was
in
my
files
and
the
office
is
doomed
roared
a
business
man
it
doomed
and
they
let
me
through
there
not
one
of
them
all
that
needs
to
get
through
more
badly
than
i
said
lucile
with
a
lump
in
her
throat
surely
there
must
be
a
way
working
their
way
back
the
two
girls
hurried
four
blocks
along
wells
street
which
ran
parallel
to
the
river
then
turned
on
madison
to
fight
their
way
toward
a
second
bridge
perhaps
it
is
open
lucile
told
florence
her
hopes
were
again
they
faced
a
rope
and
a
line
of
policemen
it
just
must
be
done
said
lucile
setting
her
teeth
hard
as
they
again
backed
away
an
alley
offered
freer
passage
than
the
street
they
had
passed
down
this
but
a
short
way
when
they
came
upon
a
ladder
truck
which
had
been
backed
in
as
a
reserve
on
it
hung
the
long
rubber
coats
and
heavy
black
hats
of
the
firemen
instinctively
lucile
hand
went
out
for
a
coat
she
glanced
to
right
and
left
she
saw
no
one
the
next
instant
she
had
donned
that
coat
and
was
drawing
a
hat
down
solidly
over
her
hair
i
know
it
an
awful
thing
to
do
she
whispered
but
i
am
doing
it
for
them
not
for
myself
you
may
come
or
stay
it
really
my
battle
got
to
see
it
through
to
the
end
you
always
advised
against
going
further
but
i
ventured
now
it
do
or
die
florence
answer
was
to
put
out
a
hand
and
to
grasp
a
fireman
coat
the
next
moment
in
this
new
disguise
they
were
away
had
the
girls
happened
to
look
back
just
before
leaving
the
alley
they
might
have
surprised
a
man
in
the
act
of
doing
exactly
as
they
had
done
robing
himself
in
fireman
garb
dressed
as
they
now
were
they
found
the
passing
of
the
line
a
simple
matter
scores
of
fire
companies
and
hundreds
of
firemen
from
all
parts
of
the
city
had
been
called
upon
in
this
extreme
emergency
there
was
much
confusion
that
two
firemen
should
be
passing
forward
to
join
their
companies
did
not
seem
unusual
the
coats
and
hats
formed
a
complete
disguise
the
crossing
of
the
bridge
was
accomplished
on
the
run
they
reached
the
other
side
in
the
nick
of
time
for
just
as
they
leaped
upon
the
approach
the
great
cantilevers
began
to
rise
a
huge
freighter
which
had
been
disgorging
its
cargo
into
one
of
the
basements
that
line
the
river
had
been
endangered
by
the
fire
puffing
and
snarling
adding
its
bit
of
smoke
to
the
dense
lampblack
cloud
which
hung
over
the
city
a
tug
was
working
the
freighter
to
a
place
of
safety
we
have
to
stay
inside
now
we
here
panted
lucile
there
a
line
formed
along
the
other
approach
here
a
stair
leading
down
to
the
railway
tracks
we
can
follow
the
tracks
for
a
block
then
turn
west
again
there
be
no
line
there
it
too
close
to
the
fire
might
be
dangerous
florence
hung
back
ca
help
it
it
our
chance
lucile
was
halfway
down
the
stair
florence
followed
and
the
next
moment
they
were
racing
along
a
wall
beside
the
railway
track
a
switch
engine
racing
down
the
track
with
a
line
of
box
cars
one
ablaze
forced
them
to
flatten
themselves
against
the
wall
there
was
someone
following
them
the
studious
boy
in
a
fireman
uniform
he
barely
escaped
being
run
down
by
the
engine
but
when
it
had
passed
and
they
resumed
their
course
he
followed
them
darting
from
niche
to
niche
from
shadow
to
shadow
he
kept
some
distance
behind
them
up
here
panted
lucile
racing
upstairs
the
heat
was
increasing
the
climbing
of
those
stairs
seemed
to
double
its
intensity
cinders
were
falling
all
about
them
the
wind
has
shifted
florence
breathed
it
it
going
to
be
hard
lucile
did
not
reply
her
throat
was
parched
her
face
felt
as
if
it
were
on
fire
the
heavy
coat
and
hat
were
insufferable
yet
she
dared
not
cast
them
away
so
they
struggled
on
and
their
shadow
like
all
true
shadows
followed
look
oh
look
cried
florence
reeling
in
her
tracks
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
had
sent
the
fire
swooping
against
the
side
of
a
magnificent
building
of
concrete
and
steel
towering
aloft
sixteen
stories
it
covered
a
full
city
block
it
going
cried
lucile
as
she
heard
the
awful
crash
of
glass
and
saw
flames
bursting
from
the
windows
as
if
from
the
open
hearth
furnace
of
a
foundry
it
was
true
the
magnificent
mahogany
desks
from
which
great
executives
sent
out
orders
to
thousands
of
weary
tailors
made
quite
as
good
kindling
that
night
as
did
some
poor
washboard
and
they
were
given
quite
as
much
consideration
by
that
bad
master
fire
hurry
lucile
voice
was
hoarse
with
emotion
we
must
get
behind
it
out
of
the
path
of
the
wind
or
we
will
be
burned
to
a
cinder
catching
the
full
force
of
her
meaning
florence
seized
lucile
hand
and
together
they
rushed
forward
burning
cinders
rained
about
them
a
board
came
swooping
down
to
fall
in
their
very
path
twice
lucile
stumbled
and
fell
but
each
time
florence
had
her
on
her
feet
in
an
instant
courage
courage
she
whispered
only
a
few
feet
more
and
then
the
turn
after
what
seemed
an
age
they
reached
that
turn
and
found
themselves
in
a
place
where
a
breath
of
night
air
fanned
their
cheeks
buildings
lay
between
them
and
the
doomed
executive
building
the
firemen
were
plying
these
with
water
the
great
cement
structure
would
be
completely
emptied
of
its
contents
by
the
fire
but
it
would
stand
there
and
staring
like
an
egyptian
sphinx
it
may
form
a
which
will
protect
this
and
the
next
street
said
florence
hopefully
the
worst
may
be
over
chapter
xxiv
secrets
revealed
on
a
night
such
as
this
one
does
not
stand
on
formalities
there
was
a
light
burning
in
the
mystery
cottage
on
tyler
street
the
girls
entered
without
knocking
the
scene
which
struck
their
eyes
was
most
dramatic
on
a
long
low
couch
lay
the
aged
frenchman
beside
his
bed
her
hair
disheveled
her
garments
blackened
and
scorched
by
fire
knelt
the
child
she
was
silently
sobbing
the
man
for
all
one
could
see
might
be
dead
so
white
and
still
did
he
lie
yet
as
the
girls
still
dressed
in
great
coats
and
rubber
hats
stepped
into
the
room
his
eyes
opened
his
lips
moved
and
the
girls
heard
him
murmur
ah
the
firemen
now
my
books
will
burn
the
house
will
go
they
all
will
burn
but
like
montcalm
at
quebec
i
shall
not
live
to
see
my
defeat
no
no
no
the
child
sprang
to
her
feet
they
must
not
burn
they
shall
not
burn
calm
yourself
said
lucile
advancing
into
the
room
and
removing
her
coat
as
she
did
so
it
is
only
i
your
friend
lucile
the
fire
is
two
blocks
away
and
there
is
reason
to
hope
that
this
part
of
tyler
street
will
be
saved
the
huge
concrete
building
is
burning
out
from
within
but
is
standing
rugged
as
a
great
rock
it
is
your
protection
ah
then
i
shall
die
happy
breathed
the
man
no
no
no
almost
screamed
the
child
you
shall
not
die
hush
my
little
one
whispered
the
man
do
not
question
the
wisdom
of
the
almighty
my
hour
has
come
soon
i
shall
be
with
my
sires
and
with
my
sons
and
grandsons
with
all
the
brave
ones
who
have
so
nobly
defended
our
beloved
france
and
as
for
you
my
little
one
you
have
here
two
friends
and
all
my
books
it
is
in
the
tin
box
behind
the
books
my
will
i
have
no
living
kin
i
have
made
you
my
heir
the
books
are
worth
much
money
you
are
well
provided
for
your
friends
here
will
see
that
they
are
not
stolen
from
you
will
you
not
florence
and
lucile
too
touched
to
trust
themselves
to
speak
bowed
their
heads
as
for
myself
the
man
went
on
in
a
hoarse
whisper
i
have
but
one
regret
come
close
he
beckoned
to
lucile
come
very
close
i
have
something
more
to
tell
you
lucille
moved
close
to
him
something
seeming
to
say
to
her
now
you
are
to
hear
the
gargoyle
secret
not
many
days
ago
he
began
i
told
you
some
of
my
life
but
not
all
i
could
not
my
heart
was
too
sore
now
i
wish
to
tell
you
all
you
remember
that
i
said
i
took
my
books
to
paris
that
is
not
quite
true
i
started
with
all
of
them
but
not
all
arrived
one
box
of
them
the
most
precious
of
all
was
stolen
while
on
the
way
and
a
box
of
cheap
and
worthless
books
put
in
its
place
heartbroken
at
this
loss
i
traced
the
robbers
as
best
i
could
at
last
to
find
that
the
books
had
been
carried
overseas
to
america
i
came
to
america
they
had
been
sold
scattered
abroad
the
thief
eluded
me
but
the
books
i
could
trace
by
the
gargoyle
in
the
corner
and
by
the
descriptions
of
dealers
in
rare
books
i
located
many
of
them
those
who
had
them
had
paid
handsomely
for
them
they
would
not
believe
an
old
man
story
they
would
not
give
them
up
i
brought
suit
in
the
courts
it
was
no
use
no
one
would
believe
me
young
lady
the
old
man
voice
all
but
died
away
as
his
feeble
fingers
clutched
at
the
covers
young
lady
every
man
has
some
wish
which
he
hopes
to
fulfill
he
may
desire
to
become
rich
to
secure
power
to
write
a
book
to
paint
a
great
picture
there
is
always
something
as
for
me
i
wished
but
one
thing
a
very
little
thing
to
die
with
the
books
those
precious
volumes
i
had
inherited
the
foolish
wish
of
a
childish
old
man
perhaps
but
that
was
my
wish
the
war
has
taken
my
family
they
can
not
gather
by
my
bedside
i
have
only
my
books
and
thanks
to
this
child
he
attempted
to
place
his
hand
on
the
child
bowed
head
thanks
to
her
there
are
but
few
missing
at
this
the
last
moment
for
a
little
there
was
silence
in
the
room
then
the
whisper
began
again
this
time
more
faint
perhaps
it
was
wrong
the
way
i
taught
the
child
to
get
the
books
but
they
were
really
my
own
i
had
not
sold
one
of
them
they
were
all
my
own
she
knows
where
they
came
from
when
i
am
gone
if
that
is
the
way
of
america
they
may
all
be
returned
lucile
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
bent
over
the
dying
man
the
books
she
whispered
were
two
of
them
very
small
ones
the
expression
on
the
dying
man
face
grew
eager
as
he
answered
yes
yes
very
small
and
very
rare
one
was
a
book
about
fishing
and
the
other
ah
that
one
that
was
the
rarest
of
all
it
had
been
written
in
by
the
great
napoleon
and
had
been
presented
by
him
to
one
of
his
marshals
my
uncle
lucile
hand
came
out
from
behind
her
back
in
it
were
two
books
are
these
the
ones
she
asked
yes
yes
he
breathed
hoarsely
those
are
the
very
most
precious
ones
i
die
i
die
happy
for
a
second
the
glassy
eyes
stared
then
lighted
up
with
a
smile
that
was
beautiful
to
behold
ah
he
breathed
i
am
happy
now
happy
as
when
a
child
i
played
beneath
the
grapevines
in
my
own
beloved
france
those
were
his
last
words
a
moment
later
lucile
turned
to
lead
the
silently
weeping
child
into
another
room
as
she
did
so
she
encountered
a
figure
standing
with
bowed
head
it
was
the
studious
looking
boy
who
had
donned
the
fireman
coat
and
followed
them
harry
brock
she
whispered
how
did
you
come
here
i
came
in
very
much
the
same
manner
that
you
came
he
said
quietly
i
have
been
where
you
have
been
many
times
of
late
i
did
not
understand
but
i
thought
you
needed
protection
and
since
i
thought
of
myself
as
the
best
friend
you
had
among
the
men
at
the
university
i
took
that
task
upon
myself
i
have
been
in
this
room
unnoticed
for
some
time
i
heard
what
he
said
and
now
i
think
i
understand
please
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
and
and
to
thank
you
you
have
strengthened
my
faith
in
in
all
that
is
good
and
beautiful
he
stepped
awkwardly
aside
and
allowed
her
to
pass
chapter
xxv
better
days
there
was
no
time
for
explanations
that
night
the
fire
had
been
checked
the
cottage
and
the
rare
books
were
safe
but
there
were
many
other
things
to
be
attended
to
it
was
several
days
before
lucile
met
harry
brock
again
and
then
it
was
by
appointment
in
the
cozy
corner
tea
room
her
time
during
the
intervening
days
was
taken
up
with
affairs
relating
to
her
new
charge
the
child
refugee
marie
she
went
at
once
to
frank
morrow
for
advice
he
expressed
great
surprise
at
the
turn
events
had
taken
but
told
her
that
he
had
suspected
from
the
day
she
had
told
the
story
to
him
that
the
books
had
been
stolen
from
monsieur
le
bon
and
now
we
will
catch
the
thief
and
if
he
has
money
we
will
make
him
pay
he
declared
stoutly
he
made
good
his
declaration
through
the
loosely
joined
but
powerful
league
of
book
sellers
he
tracked
down
the
man
with
the
birthmark
on
his
chin
and
forced
him
to
admit
the
theft
of
the
case
of
valuable
books
as
for
money
with
which
to
make
restitution
like
most
of
his
kind
he
had
none
he
could
only
be
turned
over
to
the
tombs
to
work
out
his
atonement
the
books
taken
from
the
university
and
elsewhere
were
offered
back
to
the
last
purchasers
in
most
cases
they
returned
them
as
the
rightful
possession
to
be
sold
together
with
the
many
other
rare
books
which
had
been
left
to
marie
by
monsieur
le
bon
in
all
there
was
quite
a
tidy
sum
of
money
realized
from
the
sale
this
was
put
in
trust
for
marie
the
income
from
it
to
be
used
for
her
education
as
for
that
meeting
of
lucile
and
harry
in
the
tea
room
it
was
little
more
than
a
series
of
exclamations
on
the
part
of
one
or
the
other
of
them
as
they
related
their
part
in
the
mysterious
drama
and
you
followed
us
right
out
into
the
country
that
night
we
went
to
the
ramsey
cottage
lucile
exclaimed
yes
up
to
the
wall
harry
admitted
the
water
stopped
me
there
and
it
was
you
who
told
the
police
i
was
in
danger
when
that
terrible
man
and
woman
locked
me
in
harry
bowed
his
assent
he
related
how
night
after
night
without
understanding
their
strange
wanderings
he
had
followed
the
two
girls
about
as
a
sort
of
bodyguard
when
lucile
thought
how
many
sleepless
nights
it
had
cost
him
her
heart
was
too
full
for
words
she
tried
to
thank
him
her
lips
would
not
form
words
but
do
you
see
he
smiled
you
were
trying
to
help
someone
out
of
her
difficulties
and
i
was
trying
to
help
you
that
the
way
the
whole
world
needs
to
live
i
guess
if
we
are
all
to
be
happy
lucile
smiled
and
agreed
that
he
had
expressed
it
quite
correctly
but
down
deep
in
her
heart
she
knew
that
she
would
never
feel
quite
the
same
toward
any
of
her
other
fellow
students
as
she
did
toward
him
at
that
moment
and
so
their
ended
frank
morrow
insisted
on
the
girls
accepting
the
reward
there
were
two
other
rewards
which
had
been
offered
for
the
return
of
missing
books
so
in
the
end
lucile
and
florence
found
themselves
in
a
rather
better
financial
state
as
for
marie
she
was
taken
into
the
practice
school
of
the
university
by
special
arrangement
she
was
given
a
room
in
the
ladies
dormitory
it
was
close
to
that
of
her
good
friends
lucile
and
florence
so
she
was
never
lonely
and
in
this
atmosphere
which
was
the
world
she
was
meant
to
live
in
she
blossomed
out
like
a
flower
in
the
spring
sunshine
