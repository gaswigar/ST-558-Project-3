there
is
no
action
save
upon
a
balance
of
preface
to
the
first
edition
the
author
wishes
it
to
be
understood
that
erewhon
is
pronounced
as
a
word
of
three
syllables
all
short
thus
preface
to
second
edition
having
been
enabled
by
the
kindness
of
the
public
to
get
through
an
unusually
large
edition
of
erewhon
in
a
very
short
time
i
have
taken
the
opportunity
of
a
second
edition
to
make
some
necessary
corrections
and
to
add
a
few
passages
where
it
struck
me
that
they
would
be
appropriately
introduced
the
passages
are
few
and
it
is
my
fixed
intention
never
to
touch
the
work
again
i
may
perhaps
be
allowed
to
say
a
word
or
two
here
in
reference
to
the
coming
race
to
the
success
of
which
book
erewhon
has
been
very
generally
set
down
as
due
this
is
a
mistake
though
a
perfectly
natural
one
the
fact
is
that
erewhon
was
finished
with
the
exception
of
the
last
twenty
pages
and
a
sentence
or
two
inserted
from
time
to
time
here
and
there
throughout
the
book
before
the
first
advertisement
of
the
coming
race
appeared
a
friend
having
called
my
attention
to
one
of
the
first
of
these
advertisements
and
suggesting
that
it
probably
referred
to
a
work
of
similar
character
to
my
own
i
took
erewhon
to
a
firm
of
publishers
on
the
of
may
and
left
it
in
their
hands
for
consideration
i
then
went
abroad
and
on
learning
that
the
publishers
alluded
to
declined
the
i
let
it
alone
for
six
or
seven
months
and
being
in
an
part
of
italy
never
saw
a
single
review
of
the
coming
race
nor
a
copy
of
the
work
on
my
return
i
purposely
avoided
looking
into
it
until
i
had
sent
back
my
last
revises
to
the
printer
then
i
had
much
pleasure
in
reading
it
but
was
indeed
surprised
at
the
many
little
points
of
similarity
between
the
two
books
in
spite
of
their
entire
independence
to
one
another
i
regret
that
reviewers
have
in
some
cases
been
inclined
to
treat
the
chapters
on
machines
as
an
attempt
to
reduce
darwin
theory
to
an
absurdity
nothing
could
be
further
from
my
intention
and
few
things
would
be
more
distasteful
to
me
than
any
attempt
to
laugh
at
darwin
but
i
must
own
that
i
have
myself
to
thank
for
the
misconception
for
i
felt
sure
that
my
intention
would
be
missed
but
preferred
not
to
weaken
the
chapters
by
explanation
and
knew
very
well
that
darwin
theory
would
take
no
harm
the
only
question
in
my
mind
was
how
far
i
could
afford
to
be
misrepresented
as
laughing
at
that
for
which
i
have
the
most
profound
admiration
i
am
surprised
however
that
the
book
at
which
such
an
example
of
the
specious
misuse
of
analogy
would
seem
most
naturally
levelled
should
have
occurred
to
no
reviewer
neither
shall
i
mention
the
name
of
the
book
here
though
i
should
fancy
that
the
hint
given
will
suffice
i
have
been
held
by
some
whose
opinions
i
respect
to
have
denied
responsibility
for
their
actions
he
who
does
this
is
an
enemy
who
deserves
no
quarter
i
should
have
imagined
that
i
had
been
sufficiently
explicit
but
have
made
a
few
additions
to
the
chapter
on
malcontents
which
will
i
think
serve
to
render
further
mistake
impossible
an
anonymous
correspondent
by
the
presumably
a
clergyman
tells
me
that
in
quoting
from
the
latin
grammar
i
should
at
any
rate
have
done
so
correctly
and
that
i
should
have
written
agricolas
instead
of
agricolae
he
added
something
about
any
boy
in
the
fourth
form
which
i
shall
not
quote
but
which
made
me
very
uncomfortable
it
may
be
said
that
i
must
have
misquoted
from
design
from
ignorance
or
by
a
slip
of
the
pen
but
surely
in
these
days
it
will
be
recognised
as
harsh
to
assign
limits
to
the
boundlessness
of
truth
and
it
will
be
more
reasonably
assumed
that
each
of
the
three
possible
causes
of
misquotation
must
have
had
its
share
in
the
apparent
blunder
the
art
of
writing
things
that
shall
sound
right
and
yet
be
wrong
has
made
so
many
reputations
and
affords
comfort
to
such
a
large
number
of
readers
that
i
could
not
venture
to
neglect
it
the
latin
grammar
however
is
a
subject
on
which
some
of
the
younger
members
of
the
community
feel
strongly
so
i
have
now
written
agricolas
i
have
also
parted
with
the
word
infortuniam
though
not
without
regret
but
have
not
dared
to
meddle
with
other
similar
inaccuracies
for
the
inconsistencies
in
the
book
and
i
am
aware
that
there
are
not
a
few
i
must
ask
the
indulgence
of
the
reader
the
blame
however
lies
chiefly
with
the
erewhonians
themselves
for
they
were
really
a
very
difficult
people
to
understand
the
most
glaring
anomalies
seemed
to
afford
them
no
intellectual
inconvenience
neither
provided
they
did
not
actually
see
the
money
dropping
out
of
their
pockets
nor
suffer
immediate
physical
pain
would
they
listen
to
any
arguments
as
to
the
waste
of
money
and
happiness
which
their
folly
caused
them
but
this
had
an
effect
of
which
i
have
little
reason
to
complain
for
i
was
allowed
almost
to
call
them
to
their
faces
and
they
said
it
was
quite
true
but
that
it
did
not
matter
i
must
not
conclude
without
expressing
my
most
sincere
thanks
to
my
critics
and
to
the
public
for
the
leniency
and
consideration
with
which
they
have
treated
my
adventures
june
preface
to
the
revised
edition
my
publisher
wishes
me
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
genesis
of
the
work
a
revised
and
enlarged
edition
of
which
he
is
herewith
laying
before
the
public
i
therefore
place
on
record
as
much
as
i
can
remember
on
this
head
after
a
lapse
of
more
than
thirty
years
the
first
part
of
erewhon
written
was
an
article
headed
darwin
among
the
machines
and
signed
cellarius
it
was
written
in
the
upper
rangitata
district
of
the
canterbury
province
as
it
then
was
of
new
zealand
and
appeared
at
christchurch
in
the
press
newspaper
june
a
copy
of
this
article
is
indexed
under
my
books
in
the
british
museum
catalogue
in
passing
i
may
say
that
the
opening
chapters
of
erewhon
were
also
drawn
from
the
upper
rangitata
district
with
such
modifications
as
i
found
convenient
a
second
article
on
the
same
subject
as
the
one
just
referred
to
appeared
in
the
press
shortly
after
the
first
but
i
have
no
copy
it
treated
machines
from
a
different
point
of
view
and
was
the
basis
of
pp
of
the
present
edition
of
erewhon
this
view
ultimately
led
me
to
the
theory
i
put
forward
in
life
and
habit
published
in
november
i
have
put
a
bare
outline
of
this
theory
which
i
believe
to
be
quite
sound
into
the
mouth
of
an
erewhonian
philosopher
in
chapter
xxvii
of
this
book
in
i
rewrote
and
enlarged
darwin
among
the
machines
for
the
reasoner
a
paper
published
in
london
by
holyoake
it
appeared
july
under
the
heading
the
mechanical
creation
and
can
be
seen
in
the
british
museum
i
again
rewrote
and
enlarged
it
till
it
assumed
the
form
in
which
it
appeared
in
the
first
edition
of
erewhon
the
next
part
of
erewhon
that
i
wrote
was
the
world
of
the
unborn
a
preliminary
form
of
which
was
sent
to
holyoake
paper
but
as
i
can
not
find
it
among
those
copies
of
the
reasoner
that
are
in
the
british
museum
i
conclude
that
it
was
not
accepted
i
have
however
rather
a
strong
fancy
that
it
appeared
in
some
london
paper
of
the
same
character
as
the
reasoner
not
very
long
after
july
but
i
have
no
copy
i
also
wrote
about
this
time
the
substance
of
what
ultimately
became
the
musical
banks
and
the
trial
of
a
man
for
being
in
a
consumption
these
four
detached
papers
were
i
believe
all
that
was
written
of
erewhon
before
between
and
i
wrote
hardly
anything
being
hopeful
of
attaining
that
success
as
a
painter
which
it
has
not
been
vouchsafed
me
to
attain
but
in
the
autumn
of
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
get
occasionally
hung
at
royal
academy
exhibitions
my
friend
the
late
sir
then
broome
suggested
to
me
that
i
should
add
somewhat
to
the
articles
i
had
already
written
and
string
them
together
into
a
book
i
was
rather
fired
by
the
idea
but
as
i
only
worked
at
the
on
sundays
it
was
some
months
before
i
had
completed
it
i
see
from
my
second
preface
that
i
took
the
book
to
chapman
hall
may
and
on
their
rejection
of
it
under
the
advice
of
one
who
has
attained
the
highest
rank
among
living
writers
i
let
it
sleep
till
i
took
it
to
trubner
early
in
as
regards
its
rejection
by
chapman
hall
i
believe
their
reader
advised
them
quite
wisely
they
told
me
he
reported
that
it
was
a
philosophical
work
little
likely
to
be
popular
with
a
large
circle
of
readers
i
hope
that
if
i
had
been
their
reader
and
the
book
had
been
submitted
to
myself
i
should
have
advised
them
to
the
same
effect
erewhon
appeared
with
the
last
day
or
two
of
march
i
attribute
its
success
mainly
to
two
early
favourable
reviews
the
first
in
the
pall
mall
gazette
of
april
and
the
second
in
the
spectator
of
april
there
was
also
another
cause
i
was
complaining
once
to
a
friend
that
though
erewhon
had
met
with
such
a
warm
reception
my
subsequent
books
had
been
all
of
them
practically
born
he
said
you
forget
one
charm
that
had
but
which
none
of
your
other
books
can
have
i
asked
what
and
was
answered
the
sound
of
a
new
voice
and
of
an
unknown
voice
the
first
edition
of
erewhon
sold
in
about
three
weeks
i
had
not
taken
moulds
and
as
the
demand
was
strong
it
was
set
up
again
immediately
i
made
a
few
unimportant
alterations
and
additions
and
added
a
preface
of
which
i
can
not
say
that
i
am
particularly
proud
but
an
inexperienced
writer
with
a
head
somewhat
turned
by
unexpected
success
is
not
to
be
trusted
with
a
preface
i
made
a
few
further
very
trifling
alterations
before
moulds
were
taken
but
since
the
summer
of
as
new
editions
were
from
time
to
time
wanted
they
have
been
printed
from
stereos
then
made
having
now
i
fear
at
too
great
length
done
what
i
was
asked
to
do
i
should
like
to
add
a
few
words
on
my
own
account
i
am
still
fairly
well
satisfied
with
those
parts
of
erewhon
that
were
repeatedly
rewritten
but
from
those
that
had
only
a
single
writing
i
would
gladly
cut
out
some
forty
or
fifty
pages
if
i
could
this
however
may
not
be
for
the
copyright
will
probably
expire
in
a
little
over
twelve
years
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
revise
the
book
throughout
for
literary
inelegancies
of
which
i
found
many
more
than
i
had
expected
and
also
to
make
such
substantial
additions
as
should
secure
a
new
lease
of
life
at
any
rate
for
the
copyright
if
then
instead
of
cutting
out
say
fifty
pages
i
have
been
compelled
to
add
about
sixty
invita
minerva
the
blame
rests
neither
with
my
publisher
nor
with
me
but
with
the
copyright
laws
nevertheless
i
can
assure
the
reader
that
though
i
have
found
it
an
irksome
task
to
take
up
work
which
i
thought
i
had
got
rid
of
thirty
years
ago
and
much
of
which
i
am
ashamed
of
i
have
done
my
best
to
make
the
new
matter
savour
so
much
of
the
better
portions
of
the
old
that
none
but
the
best
critics
shall
perceive
at
what
places
the
gaps
of
between
thirty
and
forty
years
occur
lastly
if
my
readers
note
a
considerable
difference
between
the
literary
technique
of
erewhon
and
that
of
erewhon
revisited
i
would
remind
them
that
as
i
have
just
shown
erewhon
look
something
like
ten
years
in
writing
and
even
so
was
written
with
great
difficulty
while
erewhon
revisited
was
written
easily
between
november
and
the
end
of
april
there
is
no
central
idea
underlying
erewhon
whereas
the
attempt
to
realise
the
effect
of
a
single
supposed
great
miracle
dominates
the
whole
of
its
successor
in
erewhon
there
was
hardly
any
story
and
little
attempt
to
give
life
and
individuality
to
the
characters
i
hope
that
in
erewhon
revisited
both
these
defects
have
been
in
great
measure
avoided
erewhon
was
not
an
organic
whole
erewhon
revisited
may
fairly
claim
to
be
one
nevertheless
though
in
literary
workmanship
i
do
not
doubt
that
this
book
is
an
improvement
on
the
first
i
shall
be
agreeably
surprised
if
i
am
not
told
that
erewhon
with
all
its
faults
is
the
better
reading
of
the
two
samuel
butler
august
chapter
i
waste
lands
if
the
reader
will
excuse
me
i
will
say
nothing
of
my
antecedents
nor
of
the
circumstances
which
led
me
to
leave
my
native
country
the
narrative
would
be
tedious
to
him
and
painful
to
myself
suffice
it
that
when
i
left
home
it
was
with
the
intention
of
going
to
some
new
colony
and
either
finding
or
even
perhaps
purchasing
waste
crown
land
suitable
for
cattle
or
sheep
farming
by
which
means
i
thought
that
i
could
better
my
fortunes
more
rapidly
than
in
england
it
will
be
seen
that
i
did
not
succeed
in
my
design
and
that
however
much
i
may
have
met
with
that
was
new
and
strange
i
have
been
unable
to
reap
any
pecuniary
advantage
it
is
true
i
imagine
myself
to
have
made
a
discovery
which
if
i
can
be
the
first
to
profit
by
it
will
bring
me
a
recompense
beyond
all
money
computation
and
secure
me
a
position
such
as
has
not
been
attained
by
more
than
some
fifteen
or
sixteen
persons
since
the
creation
of
the
universe
but
to
this
end
i
must
possess
myself
of
a
considerable
sum
of
money
neither
do
i
know
how
to
get
it
except
by
interesting
the
public
in
my
story
and
inducing
the
charitable
to
come
forward
and
assist
me
with
this
hope
i
now
publish
my
adventures
but
i
do
so
with
great
reluctance
for
i
fear
that
my
story
will
be
doubted
unless
i
tell
the
whole
of
it
and
yet
i
dare
not
do
so
lest
others
with
more
means
than
mine
should
get
the
start
of
me
i
prefer
the
risk
of
being
doubted
to
that
of
being
anticipated
and
have
therefore
concealed
my
destination
on
leaving
england
as
also
the
point
from
which
i
began
my
more
serious
and
difficult
journey
my
chief
consolation
lies
in
the
fact
that
truth
bears
its
own
impress
and
that
my
story
will
carry
conviction
by
reason
of
the
internal
evidences
for
its
accuracy
no
one
who
is
himself
honest
will
doubt
my
being
so
i
reached
my
destination
in
one
of
the
last
months
of
but
i
dare
not
mention
the
season
lest
the
reader
should
gather
in
which
hemisphere
i
was
the
colony
was
one
which
had
not
been
opened
up
even
to
the
most
adventurous
settlers
for
more
than
eight
or
nine
years
having
been
previously
uninhabited
save
by
a
few
tribes
of
savages
who
frequented
the
seaboard
the
part
known
to
europeans
consisted
of
a
about
eight
hundred
miles
in
length
affording
three
or
four
good
harbours
and
a
tract
of
country
extending
inland
for
a
space
varying
from
two
to
three
hundred
miles
until
it
a
reached
the
offshoots
of
an
exceedingly
lofty
range
of
mountains
which
could
be
seen
from
far
out
upon
the
plains
and
were
covered
with
perpetual
snow
the
coast
was
perfectly
well
known
both
north
and
south
of
the
tract
to
which
i
have
alluded
but
in
neither
direction
was
there
a
single
harbour
for
five
hundred
miles
and
the
mountains
which
descended
almost
into
the
sea
were
covered
with
thick
timber
so
that
none
would
think
of
settling
with
this
bay
of
land
however
the
case
was
different
the
harbours
were
sufficient
the
country
was
timbered
but
not
too
heavily
it
was
admirably
suited
for
agriculture
it
also
contained
millions
on
millions
of
acres
of
the
most
beautifully
grassed
country
in
the
world
and
of
the
best
suited
for
all
manner
of
sheep
and
cattle
the
climate
was
temperate
and
very
healthy
there
were
no
wild
animals
nor
were
the
natives
dangerous
being
few
in
number
and
of
an
intelligent
tractable
disposition
it
may
be
readily
understood
that
when
once
europeans
set
foot
upon
this
territory
they
were
not
slow
to
take
advantage
of
its
capabilities
sheep
and
cattle
were
introduced
and
bred
with
extreme
rapidity
men
took
up
their
or
acres
of
country
going
inland
one
behind
the
other
till
in
a
few
years
there
was
not
an
acre
between
the
sea
and
the
front
ranges
which
was
not
taken
up
and
stations
either
for
sheep
or
cattle
were
spotted
about
at
intervals
of
some
twenty
or
thirty
miles
over
the
whole
country
the
front
ranges
stopped
the
tide
of
squatters
for
some
little
time
it
was
thought
that
there
was
too
much
snow
upon
them
for
too
many
months
in
the
year
that
the
sheep
would
get
lost
the
ground
being
too
difficult
for
shepherding
that
the
expense
of
getting
wool
down
to
the
ship
side
would
eat
up
the
farmer
profits
and
that
the
grass
was
too
rough
and
sour
for
sheep
to
thrive
upon
but
one
after
another
determined
to
try
the
experiment
and
it
was
wonderful
how
successfully
it
turned
out
men
pushed
farther
and
farther
into
the
mountains
and
found
a
very
considerable
tract
inside
the
front
range
between
it
and
another
which
was
loftier
still
though
even
this
was
not
the
highest
the
great
snowy
one
which
could
be
seen
from
out
upon
the
plains
this
second
range
however
seemed
to
mark
the
extreme
limits
of
pastoral
country
and
it
was
here
at
a
small
and
newly
founded
station
that
i
was
received
as
a
cadet
and
soon
regularly
employed
i
was
then
just
years
old
i
was
delighted
with
the
country
and
the
manner
of
life
it
was
my
daily
business
to
go
up
to
the
top
of
a
certain
high
mountain
and
down
one
of
its
spurs
on
to
the
flat
in
order
to
make
sure
that
no
sheep
had
crossed
their
boundaries
i
was
to
see
the
sheep
not
necessarily
close
at
hand
nor
to
get
them
in
a
single
mob
but
to
see
enough
of
them
here
and
there
to
feel
easy
that
nothing
had
gone
wrong
this
was
no
difficult
matter
for
there
were
not
above
eight
hundred
of
them
and
being
all
breeding
ewes
they
were
pretty
quiet
there
were
a
good
many
sheep
which
i
knew
as
two
or
three
black
ewes
and
a
black
lamb
or
two
and
several
others
which
had
some
distinguishing
mark
whereby
i
could
tell
them
i
would
try
and
see
all
these
and
if
they
were
all
there
and
the
mob
looked
large
enough
i
might
rest
assured
that
all
was
well
it
is
surprising
how
soon
the
eye
becomes
accustomed
to
missing
twenty
sheep
out
of
two
or
three
hundred
i
had
a
telescope
and
a
dog
and
would
take
bread
and
meat
and
tobacco
with
me
starting
with
early
dawn
it
would
be
night
before
i
could
complete
my
round
for
the
mountain
over
which
i
had
to
go
was
very
high
in
winter
it
was
covered
with
snow
and
the
sheep
needed
no
watching
from
above
if
i
were
to
see
sheep
dung
or
tracks
going
down
on
to
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
where
there
was
a
valley
with
a
stream
a
mere
de
i
was
to
follow
them
and
look
out
for
sheep
but
i
never
saw
any
the
sheep
always
descending
on
to
their
own
side
partly
from
habit
and
partly
because
there
was
abundance
of
good
sweet
feed
which
had
been
burnt
in
the
early
spring
just
before
i
came
and
was
now
deliciously
green
and
rich
while
that
on
the
other
side
had
never
been
burnt
and
was
rank
and
coarse
it
was
a
monotonous
life
but
it
was
very
healthy
and
one
does
not
much
mind
anything
when
one
is
well
the
country
was
the
grandest
that
can
be
imagined
how
often
have
i
sat
on
the
mountain
side
and
watched
the
waving
downs
with
the
two
white
specks
of
huts
in
the
distance
and
the
little
square
of
garden
behind
them
the
paddock
with
a
patch
of
bright
green
oats
above
the
huts
and
the
yards
and
down
on
the
flat
below
all
seen
as
through
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
so
clear
and
brilliant
was
the
air
or
as
upon
a
colossal
model
or
map
spread
out
beneath
me
beyond
the
downs
was
a
plain
going
down
to
a
river
of
great
size
on
the
farther
side
of
which
there
were
other
high
mountains
with
the
winter
snow
still
not
quite
melted
up
the
river
which
ran
winding
in
many
streams
over
a
bed
some
two
miles
broad
i
looked
upon
the
second
great
chain
and
could
see
a
narrow
gorge
where
the
river
retired
and
was
lost
i
knew
that
there
was
a
range
still
farther
back
but
except
from
one
place
near
the
very
top
of
my
own
mountain
no
part
of
it
was
visible
from
this
point
however
i
saw
whenever
there
were
no
clouds
a
single
peak
many
miles
away
and
i
should
think
about
as
high
as
any
mountain
in
the
world
never
shall
i
forget
the
utter
loneliness
of
the
prospect
only
the
little
homestead
giving
sign
of
human
handiwork
the
vastness
of
mountain
and
plain
of
river
and
sky
the
marvellous
atmospheric
effects
sometimes
black
mountains
against
a
white
sky
and
then
again
after
cold
weather
white
mountains
against
a
black
sky
sometimes
seen
through
breaks
and
swirls
of
cloud
and
sometimes
which
was
best
of
all
i
went
up
my
mountain
in
a
fog
and
then
got
above
the
mist
going
higher
and
higher
i
would
look
down
upon
a
sea
of
whiteness
through
which
would
be
thrust
innumerable
mountain
tops
that
looked
like
islands
i
am
there
now
as
i
write
i
fancy
that
i
can
see
the
downs
the
huts
the
plain
and
the
that
torrent
pathway
of
desolation
with
its
distant
roar
of
waters
oh
wonderful
wonderful
so
lonely
and
so
solemn
with
the
sad
grey
clouds
above
and
no
sound
save
a
lost
lamb
bleating
upon
the
mountain
side
as
though
its
little
heart
were
breaking
then
there
comes
some
lean
and
withered
old
ewe
with
deep
gruff
voice
and
unlovely
aspect
trotting
back
from
the
seductive
pasture
now
she
examines
this
gully
and
now
that
and
now
she
stands
listening
with
uplifted
head
that
she
may
hear
the
distant
wailing
and
obey
it
aha
they
see
and
rush
towards
each
other
alas
they
are
both
mistaken
the
ewe
is
not
the
lamb
ewe
they
are
neither
kin
nor
kind
to
one
another
and
part
in
coldness
each
must
cry
louder
and
wander
farther
yet
may
luck
be
with
them
both
that
they
may
find
their
own
at
nightfall
but
this
is
mere
dreaming
and
i
must
proceed
i
could
not
help
speculating
upon
what
might
lie
farther
up
the
river
and
behind
the
second
range
i
had
no
money
but
if
i
could
only
find
workable
country
i
might
stock
it
with
borrowed
capital
and
consider
myself
a
made
man
true
the
range
looked
so
vast
that
there
seemed
little
chance
of
getting
a
sufficient
road
through
it
or
over
it
but
no
one
had
yet
explored
it
and
it
is
wonderful
how
one
finds
that
one
can
make
a
path
into
all
sorts
of
places
and
even
get
a
road
for
which
from
a
distance
appear
inaccessible
the
river
was
so
great
that
it
must
drain
an
inner
tract
at
least
i
thought
so
and
though
every
one
said
it
would
be
madness
to
attempt
taking
sheep
farther
inland
i
knew
that
only
three
years
ago
the
same
cry
had
been
raised
against
the
country
which
my
master
flock
was
now
overrunning
i
could
not
keep
these
thoughts
out
of
my
head
as
i
would
rest
myself
upon
the
mountain
side
they
haunted
me
as
i
went
my
daily
rounds
and
grew
upon
me
from
hour
to
hour
till
i
resolved
that
after
shearing
i
would
remain
in
doubt
no
longer
but
saddle
my
horse
take
as
much
provision
with
me
as
i
could
and
go
and
see
for
myself
but
over
and
above
these
thoughts
came
that
of
the
great
range
itself
what
was
beyond
it
ah
who
could
say
there
was
no
one
in
the
whole
world
who
had
the
smallest
idea
save
those
who
were
themselves
on
the
other
side
of
it
if
indeed
there
was
any
one
at
all
could
i
hope
to
cross
it
this
would
be
the
highest
triumph
that
i
could
wish
for
but
it
was
too
much
to
think
of
yet
i
would
try
the
nearer
range
and
see
how
far
i
could
go
even
if
i
did
not
find
country
might
i
not
find
gold
or
diamonds
or
copper
or
silver
i
would
sometimes
lie
flat
down
to
drink
out
of
a
stream
and
could
see
little
yellow
specks
among
the
sand
were
these
gold
people
said
no
but
then
people
always
said
there
was
no
gold
until
it
was
found
to
be
abundant
there
was
plenty
of
slate
and
granite
which
i
had
always
understood
to
accompany
gold
and
even
though
it
was
not
found
in
paying
quantities
here
it
might
be
abundant
in
the
main
ranges
these
thoughts
filled
my
head
and
i
could
not
banish
them
chapter
ii
in
the
at
last
shearing
came
and
with
the
shearers
there
was
an
old
native
whom
they
had
nicknamed
chowbok
though
i
believe
his
real
name
was
kahabuka
he
was
a
sort
of
chief
of
the
natives
could
speak
a
little
english
and
was
a
great
favourite
with
the
missionaries
he
did
not
do
any
regular
work
with
the
shearers
but
pretended
to
help
in
the
yards
his
real
aim
being
to
get
the
grog
which
is
always
more
freely
circulated
at
he
did
not
get
much
for
he
was
apt
to
be
dangerous
when
drunk
and
very
little
would
make
him
so
still
he
did
get
it
occasionally
and
if
one
wanted
to
get
anything
out
of
him
it
was
the
best
bribe
to
offer
him
i
resolved
to
question
him
and
get
as
much
information
from
him
as
i
could
i
did
so
as
long
as
i
kept
to
questions
about
the
nearer
ranges
he
was
easy
to
get
on
with
he
had
never
been
there
but
there
were
traditions
among
his
tribe
to
the
effect
that
there
was
no
nothing
in
fact
but
stunted
timber
and
a
few
flats
it
was
very
difficult
to
reach
still
there
were
passes
one
of
them
up
our
own
river
though
not
directly
along
the
bed
the
gorge
of
which
was
not
practicable
he
had
never
seen
any
one
who
had
been
there
was
there
to
not
enough
on
this
side
but
when
i
came
to
the
main
range
his
manner
changed
at
once
he
became
uneasy
and
began
to
prevaricate
and
shuffle
in
a
very
few
minutes
i
could
see
that
of
this
too
there
existed
traditions
in
his
tribe
but
no
efforts
or
coaxing
could
get
a
word
from
him
about
them
at
last
i
hinted
about
grog
and
presently
he
feigned
consent
i
gave
it
him
but
as
soon
as
he
had
drunk
it
he
began
shamming
intoxication
and
then
went
to
sleep
or
pretended
to
do
so
letting
me
kick
him
pretty
hard
and
never
budging
i
was
angry
for
i
had
to
go
without
my
own
grog
and
had
got
nothing
out
of
him
so
the
next
day
i
determined
that
he
should
tell
me
before
i
gave
him
any
or
get
none
at
all
accordingly
when
night
came
and
the
shearers
had
knocked
off
work
and
had
their
supper
i
got
my
share
of
rum
in
a
tin
pannikin
and
made
a
sign
to
chowbok
to
follow
me
to
the
which
he
willingly
did
slipping
out
after
me
and
no
one
taking
any
notice
of
either
of
us
when
we
got
down
to
the
we
lit
a
tallow
candle
and
having
stuck
it
in
an
old
bottle
we
sat
down
upon
the
wool
bales
and
began
to
smoke
a
is
a
roomy
place
built
somewhat
on
the
same
plan
as
a
cathedral
with
aisles
on
either
side
full
of
pens
for
the
sheep
a
great
nave
at
the
upper
end
of
which
the
shearers
work
and
a
further
space
for
wool
sorters
and
packers
it
always
refreshed
me
with
a
semblance
of
antiquity
precious
in
a
new
country
though
i
very
well
knew
that
the
oldest
in
the
settlement
was
not
more
than
seven
years
old
while
this
was
only
two
chowbok
pretended
to
expect
his
grog
at
once
though
we
both
of
us
knew
very
well
what
the
other
was
after
and
that
we
were
each
playing
against
the
other
the
one
for
grog
the
other
for
information
we
had
a
hard
fight
for
more
than
two
hours
he
had
tried
to
put
me
off
with
lies
but
had
carried
no
conviction
during
the
whole
time
we
had
been
morally
wrestling
with
one
another
and
had
neither
of
us
apparently
gained
the
least
advantage
at
length
however
i
had
become
sure
that
he
would
give
in
ultimately
and
that
with
a
little
further
patience
i
should
get
his
story
out
of
him
as
upon
a
cold
day
in
winter
when
one
has
churned
as
i
had
often
had
to
do
and
churned
in
vain
and
the
butter
makes
no
sign
of
coming
at
last
one
tells
by
the
sound
that
the
cream
has
gone
to
sleep
and
then
upon
a
sudden
the
butter
comes
so
i
had
churned
at
chowbok
until
i
perceived
that
he
had
arrived
as
it
were
at
the
sleepy
stage
and
that
with
a
continuance
of
steady
quiet
pressure
the
day
was
mine
on
a
sudden
without
a
word
of
warning
he
rolled
two
bales
of
wool
his
strength
was
very
great
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
on
the
top
of
these
he
placed
another
crosswise
he
snatched
up
an
empty
threw
it
like
a
mantle
over
his
shoulders
jumped
upon
the
uppermost
bale
and
sat
upon
it
in
a
moment
his
whole
form
was
changed
his
high
shoulders
dropped
he
set
his
feet
close
together
heel
to
heel
and
toe
to
toe
he
laid
his
arms
and
hands
close
alongside
of
his
body
the
palms
following
his
thighs
he
held
his
head
high
but
quite
straight
and
his
eyes
stared
right
in
front
of
him
but
he
frowned
horribly
and
assumed
an
expression
of
face
that
was
positively
fiendish
at
the
best
of
times
chowbok
was
very
ugly
but
he
now
exceeded
all
conceivable
limits
of
the
hideous
his
mouth
extended
almost
from
ear
to
ear
grinning
horribly
and
showing
all
his
teeth
his
eyes
glared
though
they
remained
quite
fixed
and
his
forehead
was
contracted
with
a
most
malevolent
scowl
i
am
afraid
my
description
will
have
conveyed
only
the
ridiculous
side
of
his
appearance
but
the
ridiculous
and
the
sublime
are
near
and
the
grotesque
fiendishness
of
chowbok
face
approached
this
last
if
it
did
not
reach
it
i
tried
to
be
amused
but
i
felt
a
sort
of
creeping
at
the
roots
of
my
hair
and
over
my
whole
body
as
i
looked
and
wondered
what
he
could
possibly
be
intending
to
signify
he
continued
thus
for
about
a
minute
sitting
bolt
upright
as
stiff
as
a
stone
and
making
this
fearful
face
then
there
came
from
his
lips
a
low
moaning
like
the
wind
rising
and
falling
by
infinitely
small
gradations
till
it
became
almost
a
shriek
from
which
it
descended
and
died
away
after
that
he
jumped
down
from
the
bale
and
held
up
the
extended
fingers
of
both
his
hands
as
one
who
should
say
ten
though
i
did
not
then
understand
him
for
myself
i
was
with
astonishment
chowbok
rolled
the
bales
rapidly
into
their
place
and
stood
before
me
shuddering
as
in
great
fear
horror
was
written
upon
his
face
this
time
quite
involuntarily
as
though
the
natural
panic
of
one
who
had
committed
an
awful
crime
against
unknown
and
superhuman
agencies
he
nodded
his
head
and
gibbered
and
pointed
repeatedly
to
the
mountains
he
would
not
touch
the
grog
but
after
a
few
seconds
he
made
a
run
through
the
shed
door
into
the
moonlight
nor
did
he
reappear
till
next
day
at
time
when
he
turned
up
looking
very
sheepish
and
abject
in
his
civility
towards
myself
of
his
meaning
i
had
no
conception
how
could
i
all
i
could
feel
sure
of
was
that
he
had
a
meaning
which
was
true
and
awful
to
himself
it
was
enough
for
me
that
i
believed
him
to
have
given
me
the
best
he
had
and
all
he
had
this
kindled
my
imagination
more
than
if
he
had
told
me
intelligible
stories
by
the
hour
together
i
knew
not
what
the
great
snowy
ranges
might
conceal
but
i
could
no
longer
doubt
that
it
would
be
something
well
worth
discovering
i
kept
aloof
from
chowbok
for
the
next
few
days
and
showed
no
desire
to
question
him
further
when
i
spoke
to
him
i
called
him
kahabuka
which
gratified
him
greatly
he
seemed
to
have
become
afraid
of
me
and
acted
as
one
who
was
in
my
power
having
therefore
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
begin
exploring
as
soon
as
shearing
was
over
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
take
chowbok
with
me
so
i
told
him
that
i
meant
going
to
the
nearer
ranges
for
a
few
days
prospecting
and
that
he
was
to
come
too
i
made
him
promises
of
nightly
grog
and
held
out
the
chances
of
finding
gold
i
said
nothing
about
the
main
range
for
i
knew
it
would
frighten
him
i
would
get
him
as
far
up
our
own
river
as
i
could
and
trace
it
if
possible
to
its
source
i
would
then
either
go
on
by
myself
if
i
felt
my
courage
equal
to
the
attempt
or
return
with
chowbok
so
as
soon
as
ever
shearing
was
over
and
the
wool
sent
off
i
asked
leave
of
absence
and
obtained
it
also
i
bought
an
old
and
so
that
i
might
take
plenty
of
provisions
and
blankets
and
a
small
tent
i
was
to
ride
and
find
fords
over
the
river
chowbok
was
to
follow
and
lead
the
which
would
also
carry
him
over
the
fords
my
master
let
me
have
tea
and
sugar
ship
biscuits
tobacco
and
salt
mutton
with
two
or
three
bottles
of
good
brandy
for
as
the
wool
was
now
sent
down
abundance
of
provisions
would
come
up
with
the
empty
drays
everything
being
now
ready
all
the
hands
on
the
station
turned
out
to
see
us
off
and
we
started
on
our
journey
not
very
long
after
the
summer
solstice
of
chapter
iii
up
the
river
the
first
day
we
had
an
easy
time
following
up
the
great
flats
by
the
river
side
which
had
already
been
twice
burned
so
that
there
was
no
dense
undergrowth
to
check
us
though
the
ground
was
often
rough
and
we
had
to
go
a
good
deal
upon
the
towards
nightfall
we
had
made
a
matter
of
some
miles
and
camped
at
the
point
where
the
river
entered
upon
the
gorge
the
weather
was
delightfully
warm
considering
that
the
valley
in
which
we
were
encamped
must
have
been
at
least
two
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
the
was
here
about
a
mile
and
a
half
broad
and
entirely
covered
with
shingle
over
which
the
river
ran
in
many
winding
channels
looking
when
seen
from
above
like
a
tangled
skein
of
ribbon
and
glistening
in
the
sun
we
knew
that
it
was
liable
to
very
sudden
and
heavy
freshets
but
even
had
we
not
known
it
we
could
have
seen
it
by
the
snags
of
trees
which
must
have
been
carried
long
distances
and
by
the
mass
of
vegetable
and
mineral
which
was
banked
against
their
lower
side
showing
that
at
times
the
whole
bed
must
be
covered
with
a
roaring
torrent
many
feet
in
depth
and
of
ungovernable
fury
at
present
the
river
was
low
there
being
but
five
or
six
streams
too
deep
and
rapid
for
even
a
strong
man
to
ford
on
foot
but
to
be
crossed
safely
on
horseback
on
either
side
of
it
there
were
still
a
few
acres
of
flat
which
grew
wider
and
wider
down
the
river
till
they
became
the
large
plains
on
which
we
looked
from
my
hut
behind
us
rose
the
lowest
spurs
of
the
second
range
leading
abruptly
to
the
range
itself
and
at
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
began
the
gorge
where
the
river
narrowed
and
became
boisterous
and
terrible
the
beauty
of
the
scene
can
not
be
conveyed
in
language
the
one
side
of
the
valley
was
blue
with
evening
shadow
through
which
loomed
forest
and
precipice
hillside
and
mountain
top
and
the
other
was
still
brilliant
with
the
sunset
gold
the
wide
and
wasteful
river
with
its
ceaseless
rushing
the
beautiful
too
which
abounded
upon
the
islets
and
were
so
tame
that
we
could
come
close
up
to
them
the
ineffable
purity
of
the
air
the
solemn
peacefulness
of
the
untrodden
region
could
there
be
a
more
delightful
and
exhilarating
combination
we
set
about
making
our
camp
close
to
some
large
bush
which
came
down
from
the
mountains
on
to
the
flat
and
tethered
out
our
horses
upon
ground
as
free
as
we
could
find
it
from
anything
round
which
they
might
wind
the
rope
and
get
themselves
tied
up
we
dared
not
let
them
run
loose
lest
they
might
stray
down
the
river
home
again
we
then
gathered
wood
and
lit
the
fire
we
filled
a
tin
pannikin
with
water
and
set
it
against
the
hot
ashes
to
boil
when
the
water
boiled
we
threw
in
two
or
three
large
pinches
of
tea
and
let
them
brew
we
had
caught
half
a
dozen
young
ducks
in
the
course
of
the
day
an
easy
matter
for
the
old
birds
made
such
a
fuss
in
attempting
to
decoy
us
away
from
them
pretending
to
be
badly
hurt
as
they
say
the
plover
does
that
we
could
always
find
them
by
going
about
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
old
bird
till
we
heard
the
young
ones
crying
then
we
ran
them
down
for
they
could
not
fly
though
they
were
nearly
full
grown
chowbok
plucked
them
a
little
and
singed
them
a
good
deal
then
we
cut
them
up
and
boiled
them
in
another
pannikin
and
this
completed
our
preparations
when
we
had
done
supper
it
was
quite
dark
the
silence
and
freshness
of
the
night
the
occasional
sharp
cry
of
the
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
fire
the
subdued
rushing
of
the
river
the
sombre
forest
and
the
immediate
foreground
of
our
saddles
packs
and
blankets
made
a
picture
worthy
of
a
salvator
rosa
or
a
nicolas
poussin
i
call
it
to
mind
and
delight
in
it
now
but
i
did
not
notice
it
at
the
time
we
next
to
never
know
when
we
are
well
off
but
this
cuts
two
ways
for
if
we
did
we
should
perhaps
know
better
when
we
are
ill
off
also
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
there
are
as
many
ignorant
of
the
one
as
of
the
other
he
who
wrote
o
fortunatos
nimium
sua
si
bona
norint
agricolas
might
have
written
quite
as
truly
o
infortunatos
nimium
sua
si
mala
norint
and
there
are
few
of
us
who
are
not
protected
from
the
keenest
pain
by
our
inability
to
see
what
it
is
that
we
have
done
what
we
are
suffering
and
what
we
truly
are
let
us
be
grateful
to
the
mirror
for
revealing
to
us
our
appearance
only
we
found
as
soft
a
piece
of
ground
as
we
could
though
it
was
all
stony
and
having
collected
grass
and
so
disposed
of
ourselves
that
we
had
a
little
hollow
for
our
we
strapped
our
blankets
around
us
and
went
to
sleep
waking
in
the
night
i
saw
the
stars
overhead
and
the
moonlight
bright
upon
the
mountains
the
river
was
ever
rushing
i
heard
one
of
our
horses
neigh
to
its
companion
and
was
assured
that
they
were
still
at
hand
i
had
no
care
of
mind
or
body
save
that
i
had
doubtless
many
difficulties
to
overcome
there
came
upon
me
a
delicious
sense
of
peace
a
fulness
of
contentment
which
i
do
not
believe
can
be
felt
by
any
but
those
who
have
spent
days
consecutively
on
horseback
or
at
any
rate
in
the
open
air
next
morning
we
found
our
last
night
frozen
at
the
bottom
of
the
pannikins
though
it
was
not
nearly
the
beginning
of
autumn
we
breakfasted
as
we
had
supped
and
were
on
our
way
by
six
in
half
an
hour
we
had
entered
the
gorge
and
turning
round
a
corner
we
bade
farewell
to
the
last
sight
of
my
master
country
the
gorge
was
narrow
and
precipitous
the
river
was
now
only
a
few
yards
wide
and
roared
and
thundered
against
rocks
of
many
tons
in
weight
the
sound
was
deafening
for
there
was
a
great
volume
of
water
we
were
two
hours
in
making
less
than
a
mile
and
that
with
danger
sometimes
in
the
river
and
sometimes
on
the
rock
there
was
that
damp
black
smell
of
rocks
covered
with
slimy
vegetation
as
near
some
huge
waterfall
where
spray
is
ever
rising
the
air
was
clammy
and
cold
i
can
not
conceive
how
our
horses
managed
to
keep
their
footing
especially
the
one
with
the
pack
and
i
dreaded
the
having
to
return
almost
as
much
as
going
forward
i
suppose
this
lasted
three
miles
but
it
was
well
midday
when
the
gorge
got
a
little
wider
and
a
small
stream
came
into
it
from
a
tributary
valley
farther
progress
up
the
main
river
was
impossible
for
the
cliffs
descended
like
walls
so
we
went
up
the
side
stream
chowbok
seeming
to
think
that
here
must
be
the
pass
of
which
reports
existed
among
his
people
we
now
incurred
less
of
actual
danger
but
more
fatigue
and
it
was
only
after
infinite
trouble
owing
to
the
rocks
and
tangled
vegetation
that
we
got
ourselves
and
our
horses
upon
the
saddle
from
which
this
small
stream
descended
by
that
time
clouds
had
descended
upon
us
and
it
was
raining
heavily
moreover
it
was
six
and
we
were
tired
out
having
made
perhaps
six
miles
in
twelve
hours
on
the
saddle
there
was
some
coarse
grass
which
was
in
full
seed
and
therefore
very
nourishing
for
the
horses
also
abundance
of
anise
and
thistle
of
which
they
are
extravagantly
fond
so
we
turned
them
loose
and
prepared
to
camp
everything
was
soaking
wet
and
we
were
with
cold
indeed
we
were
very
uncomfortable
there
was
brushwood
about
but
we
could
get
no
fire
till
we
had
shaved
off
the
wet
outside
of
some
dead
branches
and
filled
our
pockets
with
the
dry
inside
chips
having
done
this
we
managed
to
start
a
fire
nor
did
we
allow
it
to
go
out
when
we
had
once
started
it
we
pitched
the
tent
and
by
nine
were
comparatively
warm
and
dry
next
morning
it
was
fine
we
broke
camp
and
after
advancing
a
short
distance
we
found
that
by
descending
over
ground
less
difficult
than
yesterday
we
should
come
again
upon
the
which
had
opened
out
above
the
gorge
but
it
was
plain
at
a
glance
that
there
was
no
available
sheep
country
nothing
but
a
few
flats
covered
with
scrub
on
either
side
the
river
and
mountains
which
were
perfectly
worthless
but
we
could
see
the
main
range
there
was
no
mistake
about
this
the
glaciers
were
tumbling
down
the
mountain
sides
like
cataracts
and
seemed
actually
to
descend
upon
the
there
could
be
no
serious
difficulty
in
reaching
them
by
following
up
the
river
which
was
wide
and
open
but
it
seemed
rather
an
objectless
thing
to
do
for
the
main
range
looked
hopeless
and
my
curiosity
about
the
nature
of
the
country
above
the
gorge
was
now
quite
satisfied
there
was
no
money
in
it
whatever
unless
there
should
be
minerals
of
which
i
saw
no
more
signs
than
lower
down
however
i
resolved
that
i
would
follow
the
river
up
and
not
return
until
i
was
compelled
to
do
so
i
would
go
up
every
branch
as
far
as
i
could
and
wash
well
for
gold
chowbok
liked
seeing
me
do
this
but
it
never
came
to
anything
for
we
did
not
even
find
the
colour
his
dislike
of
the
main
range
appeared
to
have
worn
off
and
he
made
no
objections
to
approaching
it
i
think
he
thought
there
was
no
danger
of
my
trying
to
cross
it
and
he
was
not
afraid
of
anything
on
this
side
besides
we
might
find
gold
but
the
fact
was
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
what
to
do
if
he
saw
me
getting
too
near
it
we
passed
three
weeks
in
exploring
and
never
did
i
find
time
go
more
quickly
the
weather
was
fine
though
the
nights
got
very
cold
we
followed
every
stream
but
one
and
always
found
it
lead
us
to
a
glacier
which
was
plainly
impassable
at
any
rate
without
a
larger
party
and
ropes
one
stream
remained
which
i
should
have
followed
up
already
had
not
chowbok
said
that
he
had
risen
early
one
morning
while
i
was
yet
asleep
and
after
going
up
it
for
three
or
four
miles
had
seen
that
it
was
impossible
to
go
farther
i
had
long
ago
discovered
that
he
was
a
great
liar
so
i
was
bent
on
going
up
myself
in
brief
i
did
so
so
far
from
being
impossible
it
was
quite
easy
travelling
and
after
five
or
six
miles
i
saw
a
saddle
at
the
end
of
it
which
though
covered
deep
in
snow
was
not
glaciered
and
which
did
verily
appear
to
be
part
of
the
main
range
itself
no
words
can
express
the
intensity
of
my
delight
my
blood
was
all
on
fire
with
hope
and
elation
but
on
looking
round
for
chowbok
who
was
behind
me
i
saw
to
my
surprise
and
anger
that
he
had
turned
back
and
was
going
down
the
valley
as
hard
as
he
could
he
had
left
me
chapter
iv
the
saddle
i
cooeyed
to
him
but
he
would
not
hear
i
ran
after
him
but
he
had
got
too
good
a
start
then
i
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
thought
the
matter
carefully
over
it
was
plain
that
chowbok
had
designedly
attempted
to
keep
me
from
going
up
this
valley
yet
he
had
shown
no
unwillingness
to
follow
me
anywhere
else
what
could
this
mean
unless
that
i
was
now
upon
the
route
by
which
alone
the
mysteries
of
the
great
ranges
could
be
revealed
what
then
should
i
do
go
back
at
the
very
moment
when
it
had
become
plain
that
i
was
on
the
right
scent
hardly
yet
to
proceed
alone
would
be
both
difficult
and
dangerous
it
would
be
bad
enough
to
return
to
my
master
run
and
pass
through
the
rocky
gorges
with
no
chance
of
help
from
another
should
i
get
into
a
difficulty
but
to
advance
for
any
considerable
distance
without
a
companion
would
be
next
door
to
madness
accidents
which
are
slight
when
there
is
another
at
hand
as
the
spraining
of
an
ankle
or
the
falling
into
some
place
whence
escape
would
be
easy
by
means
of
an
outstretched
hand
and
a
bit
of
rope
may
be
fatal
to
one
who
is
alone
the
more
i
pondered
the
less
i
liked
it
and
yet
the
less
could
i
make
up
my
mind
to
return
when
i
looked
at
the
saddle
at
the
head
of
the
valley
and
noted
the
comparative
ease
with
which
its
smooth
sweep
of
snow
might
be
surmounted
i
seemed
to
see
my
way
almost
from
my
present
position
to
the
very
top
after
much
thought
i
resolved
to
go
forward
until
i
should
come
to
some
place
which
was
really
dangerous
but
then
to
return
i
should
thus
i
hoped
at
any
rate
reach
the
top
of
the
saddle
and
satisfy
myself
as
to
what
might
be
on
the
other
side
i
had
no
time
to
lose
for
it
was
now
between
ten
and
eleven
in
the
morning
fortunately
i
was
well
equipped
for
on
leaving
the
camp
and
the
horses
at
the
lower
end
of
the
valley
i
had
provided
myself
according
to
my
custom
with
everything
that
i
was
likely
to
want
for
four
or
five
days
chowbok
had
carried
half
but
had
dropped
his
whole
swag
i
suppose
at
the
moment
of
his
taking
flight
for
i
came
upon
it
when
i
ran
after
him
i
had
therefore
his
provisions
as
well
as
my
own
accordingly
i
took
as
many
biscuits
as
i
thought
i
could
carry
and
also
some
tobacco
tea
and
a
few
matches
i
rolled
all
these
things
together
with
a
flask
nearly
full
of
brandy
which
i
had
kept
in
my
pocket
for
fear
lest
chowbok
should
get
hold
of
it
inside
my
blankets
and
strapped
them
very
tightly
making
the
whole
into
a
long
roll
of
some
seven
feet
in
length
and
six
inches
in
diameter
then
i
tied
the
two
ends
together
and
put
the
whole
round
my
neck
and
over
one
shoulder
this
is
the
easiest
way
of
carrying
a
heavy
swag
for
one
can
rest
self
by
shifting
the
burden
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
i
strapped
my
pannikin
and
a
small
axe
about
my
waist
and
thus
equipped
began
to
ascend
the
valley
angry
at
having
been
misled
by
chowbok
but
determined
not
to
return
till
i
was
compelled
to
do
so
i
crossed
and
recrossed
the
stream
several
times
without
difficulty
for
there
were
many
good
fords
at
one
i
was
at
the
foot
of
the
saddle
for
four
hours
i
mounted
the
last
two
on
the
snow
where
the
going
was
easier
by
five
i
was
within
ten
minutes
of
the
top
in
a
state
of
excitement
greater
i
think
than
i
had
ever
known
before
ten
minutes
more
and
the
cold
air
from
the
other
side
came
rushing
upon
me
a
glance
i
was
on
the
main
range
another
glance
there
was
an
awful
river
muddy
and
horribly
angry
roaring
over
an
immense
thousands
of
feet
below
me
it
went
round
to
the
westward
and
i
could
see
no
farther
up
the
valley
save
that
there
were
enormous
glaciers
which
must
extend
round
the
source
of
the
river
and
from
which
it
must
spring
another
glance
and
then
i
remained
motionless
there
was
an
easy
pass
in
the
mountains
directly
opposite
to
me
through
which
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
immeasurable
extent
of
blue
and
distant
plains
easy
yes
perfectly
easy
grassed
nearly
to
the
summit
which
was
as
it
were
an
open
path
between
two
glaciers
from
which
an
inconsiderable
stream
came
tumbling
down
over
rough
but
very
possible
hillsides
till
it
got
down
to
the
level
of
the
great
river
and
formed
a
flat
where
there
was
grass
and
a
small
bush
of
stunted
timber
almost
before
i
could
believe
my
eyes
a
cloud
had
come
up
from
the
valley
on
the
other
side
and
the
plains
were
hidden
what
wonderful
luck
was
mine
had
i
arrived
five
minutes
later
the
cloud
would
have
been
over
the
pass
and
i
should
not
have
known
of
its
existence
now
that
the
cloud
was
there
i
began
to
doubt
my
memory
and
to
be
uncertain
whether
it
had
been
more
than
a
blue
line
of
distant
vapour
that
had
filled
up
the
opening
i
could
only
be
certain
of
this
much
namely
that
the
river
in
the
valley
below
must
be
the
one
next
to
the
northward
of
that
which
flowed
past
my
master
station
of
this
there
could
be
no
doubt
could
i
however
imagine
that
my
luck
should
have
led
me
up
a
wrong
river
in
search
of
a
pass
and
yet
brought
me
to
the
spot
where
i
could
detect
the
one
weak
place
in
the
fortifications
of
a
more
northern
basin
this
was
too
improbable
but
even
as
i
doubted
there
came
a
rent
in
the
cloud
opposite
and
a
second
time
i
saw
blue
lines
of
heaving
downs
growing
gradually
fainter
and
retiring
into
a
far
space
of
plain
it
was
substantial
there
had
been
no
mistake
whatsoever
i
had
hardly
made
myself
perfectly
sure
of
this
ere
the
rent
in
the
clouds
joined
up
again
and
i
could
see
nothing
more
what
then
should
i
do
the
night
would
be
upon
me
shortly
and
i
was
already
chilled
with
standing
still
after
the
exertion
of
climbing
to
stay
where
i
was
would
be
impossible
i
must
either
go
backwards
or
forwards
i
found
a
rock
which
gave
me
shelter
from
the
evening
wind
and
took
a
good
pull
at
the
brandy
flask
which
immediately
warmed
and
encouraged
me
i
asked
myself
could
i
descend
upon
the
beneath
me
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
precipices
might
prevent
my
doing
so
if
i
were
on
the
dare
i
cross
the
river
i
am
an
excellent
swimmer
yet
once
in
that
frightful
rush
of
waters
i
should
be
hurled
whithersoever
it
willed
absolutely
powerless
moreover
there
was
my
swag
i
should
perish
of
cold
and
hunger
if
i
left
it
but
i
should
certainly
be
drowned
if
i
attempted
to
carry
it
across
the
river
these
were
serious
considerations
but
the
hope
of
finding
an
immense
tract
of
available
sheep
country
which
i
was
determined
that
i
would
monopolise
as
far
as
i
possibly
could
sufficed
to
outweigh
them
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
felt
resolved
that
having
made
so
important
a
discovery
as
a
pass
into
a
country
which
was
probably
as
valuable
as
that
on
our
own
side
of
the
ranges
i
would
follow
it
up
and
ascertain
its
value
even
though
i
should
pay
the
penalty
of
failure
with
life
itself
the
more
i
thought
the
more
determined
i
became
either
to
win
fame
and
perhaps
fortune
by
entering
upon
this
unknown
world
or
give
up
life
in
the
attempt
in
fact
i
felt
that
life
would
be
no
longer
valuable
if
i
were
to
have
seen
so
great
a
prize
and
refused
to
grasp
at
the
possible
profits
therefrom
i
had
still
an
hour
of
good
daylight
during
which
i
might
begin
my
descent
on
to
some
suitable
but
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
at
first
i
got
along
rapidly
for
i
was
on
the
snow
and
sank
into
it
enough
to
save
me
from
falling
though
i
went
forward
straight
down
the
mountain
side
as
fast
as
i
could
but
there
was
less
snow
on
this
side
than
on
the
other
and
i
had
soon
done
with
it
getting
on
to
a
coomb
of
dangerous
and
very
stony
ground
where
a
slip
might
have
given
me
a
disastrous
fall
but
i
was
careful
with
all
my
speed
and
got
safely
to
the
bottom
where
there
were
patches
of
coarse
grass
and
an
attempt
here
and
there
at
brushwood
what
was
below
this
i
could
not
see
i
advanced
a
few
hundred
yards
farther
and
found
that
i
was
on
the
brink
of
a
frightful
precipice
which
no
one
in
his
senses
would
attempt
descending
i
bethought
me
however
to
try
the
creek
which
drained
the
coomb
and
see
whether
it
might
not
have
made
itself
a
smoother
way
in
a
few
minutes
i
found
myself
at
the
upper
end
of
a
chasm
in
the
rocks
something
like
twll
dhu
only
on
a
greatly
larger
scale
the
creek
had
found
its
way
into
it
and
had
worn
a
deep
channel
through
a
material
which
appeared
softer
than
that
upon
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
i
believe
it
must
have
been
a
different
geological
formation
though
i
regret
to
say
that
i
can
not
tell
what
it
was
i
looked
at
this
rift
in
great
doubt
then
i
went
a
little
way
on
either
side
of
it
and
found
myself
looking
over
the
edge
of
horrible
precipices
on
to
the
river
which
roared
some
four
or
five
thousand
feet
below
me
i
dared
not
think
of
getting
down
at
all
unless
i
committed
myself
to
the
rift
of
which
i
was
hopeful
when
i
reflected
that
the
rock
was
soft
and
that
the
water
might
have
worn
its
channel
tolerably
evenly
through
the
whole
extent
the
darkness
was
increasing
with
every
minute
but
i
should
have
twilight
for
another
so
i
went
into
the
chasm
though
by
no
means
without
fear
and
resolved
to
return
and
camp
and
try
some
other
path
next
day
should
i
come
to
any
serious
difficulty
in
about
five
minutes
i
had
completely
lost
my
head
the
side
of
the
rift
became
hundreds
of
feet
in
height
and
overhung
so
that
i
could
not
see
the
sky
it
was
full
of
rocks
and
i
had
many
falls
and
bruises
i
was
wet
through
from
falling
into
the
water
of
which
there
was
no
great
volume
but
it
had
such
force
that
i
could
do
nothing
against
it
once
i
had
to
leap
down
a
not
inconsiderable
waterfall
into
a
deep
pool
below
and
my
swag
was
so
heavy
that
i
was
very
nearly
drowned
i
had
indeed
a
escape
but
as
luck
would
have
it
providence
was
on
my
side
shortly
afterwards
i
began
to
fancy
that
the
rift
was
getting
wider
and
that
there
was
more
brushwood
presently
i
found
myself
on
an
open
grassy
slope
and
feeling
my
way
a
little
farther
along
the
stream
i
came
upon
a
flat
place
with
wood
where
i
could
camp
comfortably
which
was
well
for
it
was
now
quite
dark
my
first
care
was
for
my
matches
were
they
dry
the
outside
of
my
swag
had
got
completely
wet
but
on
undoing
the
blankets
i
found
things
warm
and
dry
within
how
thankful
i
was
i
lit
a
fire
and
was
grateful
for
its
warmth
and
company
i
made
myself
some
tea
and
ate
two
of
my
biscuits
my
brandy
i
did
not
touch
for
i
had
little
left
and
might
want
it
when
my
courage
failed
me
all
that
i
did
i
did
almost
mechanically
for
i
could
not
realise
my
situation
to
myself
beyond
knowing
that
i
was
alone
and
that
return
through
the
chasm
which
i
had
just
descended
would
be
impossible
it
is
a
dreadful
feeling
that
of
being
cut
off
from
all
one
kind
i
was
still
full
of
hope
and
built
golden
castles
for
myself
as
soon
as
i
was
warmed
with
food
and
fire
but
i
do
not
believe
that
any
man
could
long
retain
his
reason
in
such
solitude
unless
he
had
the
companionship
of
animals
one
begins
doubting
one
own
identity
i
remember
deriving
comfort
even
from
the
sight
of
my
blankets
and
the
sound
of
my
watch
ticking
things
which
seemed
to
link
me
to
other
people
but
the
screaming
of
the
frightened
me
as
also
a
chattering
bird
which
i
had
never
heard
before
and
which
seemed
to
laugh
at
me
though
i
soon
got
used
to
it
and
before
long
could
fancy
that
it
was
many
years
since
i
had
first
heard
it
i
took
off
my
clothes
and
wrapped
my
inside
blanket
about
me
till
my
things
were
dry
the
night
was
very
still
and
i
made
a
roaring
fire
so
i
soon
got
warm
and
at
last
could
put
my
clothes
on
again
then
i
strapped
my
blanket
round
me
and
went
to
sleep
as
near
the
fire
as
i
could
i
dreamed
that
there
was
an
organ
placed
in
my
master
the
faded
away
and
the
organ
seemed
to
grow
and
grow
amid
a
blaze
of
brilliant
light
till
it
became
like
a
golden
city
upon
the
side
of
a
mountain
with
rows
upon
rows
of
pipes
set
in
cliffs
and
precipices
one
above
the
other
and
in
mysterious
caverns
like
that
of
fingal
within
whose
depths
i
could
see
the
burnished
pillars
gleaming
in
the
front
there
was
a
flight
of
lofty
terraces
at
the
top
of
which
i
could
see
a
man
with
his
head
buried
forward
towards
a
and
his
body
swaying
from
side
to
side
amid
the
storm
of
huge
arpeggioed
harmonies
that
came
crashing
overhead
and
round
then
there
was
one
who
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
and
said
do
you
not
see
it
is
handel
but
i
had
hardly
apprehended
and
was
trying
to
scale
the
terraces
and
get
near
him
when
i
awoke
dazzled
with
the
vividness
and
distinctness
of
the
dream
a
piece
of
wood
had
burned
through
and
the
ends
had
fallen
into
the
ashes
with
a
blaze
this
i
supposed
had
both
given
me
my
dream
and
robbed
me
of
it
i
was
bitterly
disappointed
and
sitting
up
on
my
elbow
came
back
to
reality
and
my
strange
surroundings
as
best
i
could
i
was
thoroughly
aroused
moreover
i
felt
a
foreshadowing
as
though
my
attention
were
arrested
by
something
more
than
the
dream
although
no
sense
in
particular
was
as
yet
appealed
to
i
held
my
breath
and
waited
and
then
i
heard
was
it
fancy
nay
i
listened
again
and
again
and
i
hear
a
faint
and
extremely
distant
sound
of
music
like
that
of
an
aeolian
harp
borne
upon
the
wind
which
was
blowing
fresh
and
chill
from
the
opposite
mountains
the
roots
of
my
hair
thrilled
i
listened
but
the
wind
had
died
and
fancying
that
it
must
have
been
the
wind
itself
no
on
a
sudden
i
remembered
the
noise
which
chowbok
had
made
in
the
yes
it
was
that
thank
heaven
whatever
it
was
it
was
over
now
i
reasoned
with
myself
and
recovered
my
firmness
i
became
convinced
that
i
had
only
been
dreaming
more
vividly
than
usual
soon
i
began
even
to
laugh
and
think
what
a
fool
i
was
to
be
frightened
at
nothing
reminding
myself
that
even
if
i
were
to
come
to
a
bad
end
it
would
be
no
such
dreadful
matter
after
all
i
said
my
prayers
a
duty
which
i
had
too
often
neglected
and
in
a
little
time
fell
into
a
really
refreshing
sleep
which
lasted
till
broad
daylight
and
restored
me
i
rose
and
searching
among
the
embers
of
my
fire
i
found
a
few
live
coals
and
soon
had
a
blaze
again
i
got
breakfast
and
was
delighted
to
have
the
company
of
several
small
birds
which
hopped
about
me
and
perched
on
my
boots
and
hands
i
felt
comparatively
happy
but
i
can
assure
the
reader
that
i
had
had
a
far
worse
time
of
it
than
i
have
told
him
and
i
strongly
recommend
him
to
remain
in
europe
if
he
can
or
at
any
rate
in
some
country
which
has
been
explored
and
settled
rather
than
go
into
places
where
others
have
not
been
before
him
exploring
is
delightful
to
look
forward
to
and
back
upon
but
it
is
not
comfortable
at
the
time
unless
it
be
of
such
an
easy
nature
as
not
to
deserve
the
name
chapter
v
the
river
and
the
range
my
next
business
was
to
descend
upon
the
river
i
had
lost
sight
of
the
pass
which
i
had
seen
from
the
saddle
but
had
made
such
notes
of
it
that
i
could
not
fail
to
find
it
i
was
bruised
and
stiff
and
my
boots
had
begun
to
give
for
i
had
been
going
on
rough
ground
for
more
than
three
weeks
but
as
the
day
wore
on
and
i
found
myself
descending
without
serious
difficulty
i
became
easier
in
a
couple
of
hours
i
got
among
pine
forests
where
there
was
little
undergrowth
and
descended
quickly
till
i
reached
the
edge
of
another
precipice
which
gave
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
though
i
eventually
managed
to
avoid
it
by
about
three
or
four
i
found
myself
on
the
from
calculations
which
i
made
as
to
the
height
of
the
valley
on
the
other
side
the
saddle
over
which
i
had
come
i
concluded
that
the
saddle
itself
could
not
be
less
than
nine
thousand
feet
high
and
i
should
think
that
the
on
to
which
i
now
descended
was
three
thousand
feet
above
the
the
water
had
a
terrific
current
with
a
fall
of
not
less
than
forty
to
fifty
feet
per
mile
it
was
certainly
the
river
next
to
the
northward
of
that
which
flowed
past
my
master
run
and
would
have
to
go
through
an
impassable
gorge
as
is
commonly
the
case
with
the
rivers
of
that
country
before
it
came
upon
known
parts
it
was
reckoned
to
be
nearly
two
thousand
feet
above
the
where
it
came
out
of
the
gorge
on
to
the
plains
as
soon
as
i
got
to
the
river
side
i
liked
it
even
less
than
i
thought
i
should
it
was
muddy
being
near
its
parent
glaciers
the
stream
was
wide
rapid
and
rough
and
i
could
hear
the
smaller
stones
knocking
against
each
other
under
the
rage
of
the
waters
as
upon
a
seashore
fording
was
out
of
the
question
i
could
not
swim
and
carry
my
swag
and
i
dared
not
leave
my
swag
behind
me
my
only
chance
was
to
make
a
small
raft
and
that
would
be
difficult
to
make
and
not
at
all
safe
when
it
was
made
not
for
one
man
in
such
a
current
as
it
was
too
late
to
do
much
that
afternoon
i
spent
the
rest
of
it
in
going
up
and
down
the
river
side
and
seeing
where
i
should
find
the
most
favourable
crossing
then
i
camped
early
and
had
a
quiet
comfortable
night
with
no
more
music
for
which
i
was
thankful
as
it
had
haunted
me
all
day
although
i
perfectly
well
knew
that
it
had
been
nothing
but
my
own
fancy
brought
on
by
the
reminiscence
of
what
i
had
heard
from
chowbok
and
by
the
of
the
preceding
evening
next
day
i
began
gathering
the
dry
bloom
stalks
of
a
kind
of
flag
or
looking
plant
which
was
abundant
and
whose
leaves
when
torn
into
strips
were
as
strong
as
the
strongest
string
i
brought
them
to
the
waterside
and
fell
to
making
myself
a
kind
of
rough
platform
which
should
suffice
for
myself
and
my
swag
if
i
could
only
stick
to
it
the
stalks
were
ten
or
twelve
feet
long
and
very
strong
but
light
and
hollow
i
made
my
raft
entirely
of
them
binding
bundles
of
them
at
right
angles
to
each
other
neatly
and
strongly
with
strips
from
the
leaves
of
the
same
plant
and
tying
other
rods
across
it
took
me
all
day
till
nearly
four
to
finish
the
raft
but
i
had
still
enough
daylight
for
crossing
and
resolved
on
doing
so
at
once
i
had
selected
a
place
where
the
river
was
broad
and
comparatively
still
some
seventy
or
eighty
yards
above
a
furious
rapid
at
this
spot
i
had
built
my
raft
i
now
launched
it
made
my
swag
fast
to
the
middle
and
got
on
to
it
myself
keeping
in
my
hand
one
of
the
longest
blossom
stalks
so
that
i
might
punt
myself
across
as
long
as
the
water
was
shallow
enough
to
let
me
do
so
i
got
on
pretty
well
for
twenty
or
thirty
yards
from
the
shore
but
even
in
this
short
space
i
nearly
upset
my
raft
by
shifting
too
rapidly
from
one
side
to
the
other
the
water
then
became
much
deeper
and
i
leaned
over
so
far
in
order
to
get
the
bloom
rod
to
the
bottom
that
i
had
to
stay
still
leaning
on
the
rod
for
a
few
seconds
then
when
i
lifted
up
the
rod
from
the
ground
the
current
was
too
much
for
me
and
i
found
myself
being
carried
down
the
rapid
everything
in
a
second
flew
past
me
and
i
had
no
more
control
over
the
raft
neither
can
i
remember
anything
except
hurry
and
noise
and
waters
which
in
the
end
upset
me
but
it
all
came
right
and
i
found
myself
near
the
shore
not
more
than
up
to
my
knees
in
water
and
pulling
my
raft
to
land
fortunately
upon
the
left
bank
of
the
river
which
was
the
one
i
wanted
when
i
had
landed
i
found
that
i
was
about
a
mile
or
perhaps
a
little
less
below
the
point
from
which
i
started
my
swag
was
wet
upon
the
outside
and
i
was
myself
dripping
but
i
had
gained
my
point
and
knew
that
my
difficulties
were
for
a
time
over
i
then
lit
my
fire
and
dried
myself
having
done
so
i
caught
some
of
the
young
ducks
and
which
were
abundant
on
and
near
the
so
that
i
had
not
only
a
good
meal
of
which
i
was
in
great
want
having
had
an
insufficient
diet
from
the
time
that
chowbok
left
me
but
was
also
well
provided
for
the
morrow
i
thought
of
chowbok
and
felt
how
useful
he
had
been
to
me
and
in
how
many
ways
i
was
the
loser
by
his
absence
having
now
to
do
all
sorts
of
things
for
myself
which
he
had
hitherto
done
for
me
and
could
do
infinitely
better
than
i
could
moreover
i
had
set
my
heart
upon
making
him
a
real
convert
to
the
christian
religion
which
he
had
already
embraced
outwardly
though
i
can
not
think
that
it
had
taken
deep
root
in
his
impenetrably
stupid
nature
i
used
to
catechise
him
by
our
camp
fire
and
explain
to
him
the
mysteries
of
the
trinity
and
of
original
sin
with
which
i
was
myself
familiar
having
been
the
grandson
of
an
archdeacon
by
my
mother
side
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
my
father
was
a
clergyman
of
the
english
church
i
was
therefore
sufficiently
qualified
for
the
task
and
was
the
more
inclined
to
it
over
and
above
my
real
desire
to
save
the
unhappy
creature
from
an
eternity
of
torture
by
recollecting
the
promise
of
james
that
if
any
one
converted
a
sinner
which
chowbok
surely
was
he
should
hide
a
multitude
of
sins
i
reflected
therefore
that
the
conversion
of
chowbok
might
in
some
degree
compensate
for
irregularities
and
in
my
own
previous
life
the
remembrance
of
which
had
been
more
than
once
unpleasant
to
me
during
my
recent
experiences
indeed
on
one
occasion
i
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
baptize
him
as
well
as
i
could
having
ascertained
that
he
had
certainly
not
been
both
christened
and
baptized
and
gathering
from
his
telling
me
that
he
had
received
the
name
william
from
the
missionary
that
it
was
probably
the
rite
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
i
thought
it
great
carelessness
on
the
part
of
the
missionary
to
have
omitted
the
second
and
certainly
more
important
ceremony
which
i
have
always
understood
precedes
christening
both
in
the
case
of
infants
and
of
adult
converts
and
when
i
thought
of
the
risks
we
were
both
incurring
i
determined
that
there
should
be
no
further
delay
fortunately
it
was
not
yet
twelve
so
i
baptized
him
at
once
from
one
of
the
pannikins
the
only
vessels
i
had
reverently
and
i
trust
efficiently
i
then
set
myself
to
work
to
instruct
him
in
the
deeper
mysteries
of
our
belief
and
to
make
him
not
only
in
name
but
in
heart
a
christian
it
is
true
that
i
might
not
have
succeeded
for
chowbok
was
very
hard
to
teach
indeed
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
that
i
baptized
him
he
tried
for
the
twentieth
time
to
steal
the
brandy
which
made
me
rather
unhappy
as
to
whether
i
could
have
baptized
him
rightly
he
had
a
book
more
than
twenty
years
old
which
had
been
given
him
by
the
missionaries
but
the
only
thing
in
it
which
had
taken
any
living
hold
upon
him
was
the
title
of
adelaide
the
queen
dowager
which
he
would
repeat
whenever
strongly
moved
or
touched
and
which
did
really
seem
to
have
some
deep
spiritual
significance
to
him
though
he
could
never
completely
separate
her
individuality
from
that
of
mary
magdalene
whose
name
had
also
fascinated
him
though
in
a
less
degree
he
was
indeed
stony
ground
but
by
digging
about
him
i
might
have
at
any
rate
deprived
him
of
all
faith
in
the
religion
of
his
tribe
which
would
have
been
half
way
towards
making
him
a
sincere
christian
and
now
all
this
was
cut
off
from
me
and
i
could
neither
be
of
further
spiritual
assistance
to
him
nor
he
of
bodily
profit
to
myself
besides
any
company
was
better
than
being
quite
alone
i
got
very
melancholy
as
these
reflections
crossed
me
but
when
i
had
boiled
the
ducks
and
eaten
them
i
was
much
better
i
had
a
little
tea
left
and
about
a
pound
of
tobacco
which
should
last
me
for
another
fortnight
with
moderate
smoking
i
had
also
eight
ship
biscuits
and
most
precious
of
all
about
six
ounces
of
brandy
which
i
presently
reduced
to
four
for
the
night
was
cold
i
rose
with
early
dawn
and
in
an
hour
i
was
on
my
way
feeling
strange
not
to
say
weak
from
the
burden
of
solitude
but
full
of
hope
when
i
considered
how
many
dangers
i
had
overcome
and
that
this
day
should
see
me
at
the
summit
of
the
dividing
range
after
a
slow
but
steady
climb
of
between
three
and
four
hours
during
which
i
met
with
no
serious
hindrance
i
found
myself
upon
a
tableland
and
close
to
a
glacier
which
i
recognised
as
marking
the
summit
of
the
pass
above
it
towered
a
succession
of
rugged
precipices
and
snowy
mountain
sides
the
solitude
was
greater
than
i
could
bear
the
mountain
upon
my
master
was
a
crowded
thoroughfare
in
comparison
with
this
sombre
sullen
place
the
air
moreover
was
dark
and
heavy
which
made
the
loneliness
even
more
oppressive
there
was
an
inky
gloom
over
all
that
was
not
covered
with
snow
and
ice
grass
there
was
none
each
moment
i
felt
increasing
upon
me
that
dreadful
doubt
as
to
my
own
identity
as
to
the
continuity
of
my
past
and
present
existence
which
is
the
first
sign
of
that
distraction
which
comes
on
those
who
have
lost
themselves
in
the
bush
i
had
fought
against
this
feeling
hitherto
and
had
conquered
it
but
the
intense
silence
and
gloom
of
this
rocky
wilderness
were
too
much
for
me
and
i
felt
that
my
power
of
collecting
myself
was
beginning
to
be
impaired
i
rested
for
a
little
while
and
then
advanced
over
very
rough
ground
until
i
reached
the
lower
end
of
the
glacier
then
i
saw
another
glacier
descending
from
the
eastern
side
into
a
small
lake
i
passed
along
the
western
side
of
the
lake
where
the
ground
was
easier
and
when
i
had
got
about
half
way
i
expected
that
i
should
see
the
plains
which
i
had
already
seen
from
the
opposite
mountains
but
it
was
not
to
be
so
for
the
clouds
rolled
up
to
the
very
summit
of
the
pass
though
they
did
not
overlip
it
on
to
the
side
from
which
i
had
come
i
therefore
soon
found
myself
enshrouded
by
a
cold
thin
vapour
which
prevented
my
seeing
more
than
a
very
few
yards
in
front
of
me
then
i
came
upon
a
large
patch
of
old
snow
in
which
i
could
distinctly
trace
the
tracks
of
goats
and
in
one
place
as
it
seemed
to
me
there
had
been
a
dog
following
them
had
i
lighted
upon
a
land
of
shepherds
the
ground
where
not
covered
with
snow
was
so
poor
and
stony
and
there
was
so
little
herbage
that
i
could
see
no
sign
of
a
path
or
regular
but
i
could
not
help
feeling
rather
uneasy
as
i
wondered
what
sort
of
a
reception
i
might
meet
with
if
i
were
to
come
suddenly
upon
inhabitants
i
was
thinking
of
this
and
proceeding
cautiously
through
the
mist
when
i
began
to
fancy
that
i
saw
some
objects
darker
than
the
cloud
looming
in
front
of
me
a
few
steps
brought
me
nearer
and
a
shudder
of
unutterable
horror
ran
through
me
when
i
saw
a
circle
of
gigantic
forms
many
times
higher
than
myself
upstanding
grim
and
grey
through
the
veil
of
cloud
before
me
i
suppose
i
must
have
fainted
for
i
found
myself
some
time
afterwards
sitting
upon
the
ground
sick
and
deadly
cold
there
were
the
figures
quite
still
and
silent
seen
vaguely
through
the
thick
gloom
but
in
human
shape
indisputably
a
sudden
thought
occurred
to
me
which
would
have
doubtless
struck
me
at
once
had
i
not
been
prepossessed
with
forebodings
at
the
time
that
i
first
saw
the
figures
and
had
not
the
cloud
concealed
them
from
me
i
mean
that
they
were
not
living
beings
but
statues
i
determined
that
i
would
count
fifty
slowly
and
was
sure
that
the
objects
were
not
alive
if
during
that
time
i
could
detect
no
sign
of
motion
how
thankful
was
i
when
i
came
to
the
end
of
my
fifty
and
there
had
been
no
movement
i
counted
a
second
time
but
again
all
was
still
i
then
advanced
timidly
forward
and
in
another
moment
i
saw
that
my
surmise
was
correct
i
had
come
upon
a
sort
of
stonehenge
of
rude
and
barbaric
figures
seated
as
chowbok
had
sat
when
i
questioned
him
in
the
and
with
the
same
superhumanly
malevolent
expression
upon
their
faces
they
had
been
all
seated
but
two
had
fallen
they
were
barbarous
neither
egyptian
nor
assyrian
nor
japanese
different
from
any
of
these
and
yet
akin
to
all
they
were
six
or
seven
times
larger
than
life
of
great
antiquity
worn
and
lichen
grown
they
were
ten
in
number
there
was
snow
upon
their
heads
and
wherever
snow
could
lodge
each
statue
had
been
built
of
four
or
five
enormous
blocks
but
how
these
had
been
raised
and
put
together
is
known
to
those
alone
who
raised
them
each
was
terrible
after
a
different
kind
one
was
raging
furiously
as
in
pain
and
great
despair
another
was
lean
and
cadaverous
with
famine
another
cruel
and
idiotic
but
with
the
silliest
simper
that
can
be
conceived
this
one
had
fallen
and
looked
exquisitely
ludicrous
in
his
fall
the
mouths
of
all
were
more
or
less
open
and
as
i
looked
at
them
from
behind
i
saw
that
their
heads
had
been
hollowed
i
was
sick
and
shivering
with
cold
solitude
had
unmanned
me
already
and
i
was
utterly
unfit
to
have
come
upon
such
an
assembly
of
fiends
in
such
a
dreadful
wilderness
and
without
preparation
i
would
have
given
everything
i
had
in
the
world
to
have
been
back
at
my
master
station
but
that
was
not
to
be
thought
of
my
head
was
failing
and
i
felt
sure
that
i
could
never
get
back
alive
then
came
a
gust
of
howling
wind
accompanied
with
a
moan
from
one
of
the
statues
above
me
i
clasped
my
hands
in
fear
i
felt
like
a
rat
caught
in
a
trap
as
though
i
would
have
turned
and
bitten
at
whatever
thing
was
nearest
me
the
wildness
of
the
wind
increased
the
moans
grew
shriller
coming
from
several
statues
and
swelling
into
a
chorus
i
almost
immediately
knew
what
it
was
but
the
sound
was
so
unearthly
that
this
was
but
little
consolation
the
inhuman
beings
into
whose
hearts
the
evil
one
had
put
it
to
conceive
these
statues
had
made
their
heads
into
a
sort
of
so
that
their
mouths
should
catch
the
wind
and
sound
with
its
blowing
it
was
horrible
however
brave
a
man
might
be
he
could
never
stand
such
a
concert
from
such
lips
and
in
such
a
place
i
heaped
every
invective
upon
them
that
my
tongue
could
utter
as
i
rushed
away
from
them
into
the
mist
and
even
after
i
had
lost
sight
of
them
and
turning
my
head
round
could
see
nothing
but
the
driving
behind
me
i
heard
their
ghostly
chanting
and
felt
as
though
one
of
them
would
rush
after
me
and
grip
me
in
his
hand
and
throttle
me
i
may
say
here
that
since
my
return
to
england
i
heard
a
friend
playing
some
chords
upon
the
organ
which
put
me
very
forcibly
in
mind
of
the
erewhonian
statues
for
erewhon
is
the
name
of
the
country
upon
which
i
was
now
entering
they
rose
most
vividly
to
my
recollection
the
moment
my
friend
began
they
are
as
follows
and
are
by
the
greatest
of
all
musicians
music
score
which
can
not
be
reproduced
chapter
vi
into
erewhon
and
now
i
found
myself
on
a
narrow
path
which
followed
a
small
watercourse
i
was
too
glad
to
have
an
easy
track
for
my
flight
to
lay
hold
of
the
full
significance
of
its
existence
the
thought
however
soon
presented
itself
to
me
that
i
must
be
in
an
inhabited
country
but
one
which
was
yet
unknown
what
then
was
to
be
my
fate
at
the
hands
of
its
inhabitants
should
i
be
taken
and
offered
up
as
a
to
those
hideous
guardians
of
the
pass
it
might
be
so
i
shuddered
at
the
thought
yet
the
horrors
of
solitude
had
now
fairly
possessed
me
and
so
dazed
was
i
and
chilled
and
woebegone
that
i
could
lay
hold
of
no
idea
firmly
amid
the
crowd
of
fancies
that
kept
wandering
in
upon
my
brain
i
hurried
onward
down
down
down
more
streams
came
in
then
there
was
a
bridge
a
few
pine
logs
thrown
over
the
water
but
they
gave
me
comfort
for
savages
do
not
make
bridges
then
i
had
a
treat
such
as
i
can
never
convey
on
paper
a
moment
perhaps
the
most
striking
and
unexpected
in
my
whole
life
the
one
i
think
that
with
some
three
or
four
exceptions
i
would
most
gladly
have
again
were
i
able
to
recall
it
i
got
below
the
level
of
the
clouds
into
a
burst
of
brilliant
evening
sunshine
i
was
facing
the
and
the
sun
was
full
upon
me
oh
how
its
light
cheered
me
but
what
i
saw
it
was
such
an
expanse
as
was
revealed
to
moses
when
he
stood
upon
the
summit
of
mount
sinai
and
beheld
that
promised
land
which
it
was
not
to
be
his
to
enter
the
beautiful
sunset
sky
was
crimson
and
gold
blue
silver
and
purple
exquisite
and
tranquillising
fading
away
therein
were
plains
on
which
i
could
see
many
a
town
and
city
with
buildings
that
had
lofty
steeples
and
rounded
domes
nearer
beneath
me
lay
ridge
behind
ridge
outline
behind
outline
sunlight
behind
shadow
and
shadow
behind
sunlight
gully
and
serrated
ravine
i
saw
large
pine
forests
and
the
glitter
of
a
noble
river
winding
its
way
upon
the
plains
also
many
villages
and
hamlets
some
of
them
quite
near
at
hand
and
it
was
on
these
that
i
pondered
most
i
sank
upon
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
a
large
tree
and
thought
what
i
had
best
do
but
i
could
not
collect
myself
i
was
quite
tired
out
and
presently
feeling
warmed
by
the
sun
and
quieted
i
fell
off
into
a
profound
sleep
i
was
awoke
by
the
sound
of
tinkling
bells
and
looking
up
i
saw
four
or
five
goats
feeding
near
me
as
soon
as
i
moved
the
creatures
turned
their
heads
towards
me
with
an
expression
of
infinite
wonder
they
did
not
run
away
but
stood
stock
still
and
looked
at
me
from
every
side
as
i
at
them
then
came
the
sound
of
chattering
and
laughter
and
there
approached
two
lovely
girls
of
about
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
old
dressed
each
in
a
sort
of
linen
gaberdine
with
a
girdle
round
the
waist
they
saw
me
i
sat
quite
still
and
looked
at
them
dazzled
with
their
extreme
beauty
for
a
moment
they
looked
at
me
and
at
each
other
in
great
amazement
then
they
gave
a
little
frightened
cry
and
ran
off
as
hard
as
they
could
so
that
that
said
i
to
myself
as
i
watched
them
scampering
i
knew
that
i
had
better
stay
where
i
was
and
meet
my
fate
whatever
it
was
to
be
and
even
if
there
were
a
better
course
i
had
no
strength
left
to
take
it
i
must
come
into
contact
with
the
inhabitants
sooner
or
later
and
it
might
as
well
be
sooner
better
not
to
seem
afraid
of
them
as
i
should
do
by
running
away
and
being
caught
with
a
hue
and
cry
or
next
day
so
i
remained
quite
still
and
waited
in
about
an
hour
i
heard
distant
voices
talking
excitedly
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
saw
the
two
girls
bringing
up
a
party
of
six
or
seven
men
well
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
and
pikes
there
was
nothing
for
it
so
i
remained
sitting
quite
still
even
after
they
had
seen
me
until
they
came
close
up
then
we
all
had
a
good
look
at
one
another
both
the
girls
and
the
men
were
very
dark
in
colour
but
not
more
so
than
the
south
italians
or
spaniards
the
men
wore
no
trousers
but
were
dressed
nearly
the
same
as
the
arabs
whom
i
have
seen
in
algeria
they
were
of
the
most
magnificent
presence
being
no
less
strong
and
handsome
than
the
women
were
beautiful
and
not
only
this
but
their
expression
was
courteous
and
benign
i
think
they
would
have
killed
me
at
once
if
i
had
made
the
slightest
show
of
violence
but
they
gave
me
no
impression
of
their
being
likely
to
hurt
me
so
long
as
i
was
quiet
i
am
not
much
given
to
liking
anybody
at
first
sight
but
these
people
impressed
me
much
more
favourably
than
i
should
have
thought
possible
so
that
i
could
not
fear
them
as
i
scanned
their
faces
one
after
another
they
were
all
powerful
men
i
might
have
been
a
match
for
any
one
of
them
singly
for
i
have
been
told
that
i
have
more
to
glory
in
the
flesh
than
in
any
other
respect
being
over
six
feet
and
proportionately
strong
but
any
two
could
have
soon
mastered
me
even
were
i
not
so
bereft
of
energy
by
my
recent
adventures
my
colour
seemed
to
surprise
them
most
for
i
have
light
hair
blue
eyes
and
a
fresh
complexion
they
could
not
understand
how
these
things
could
be
my
clothes
also
seemed
quite
beyond
them
their
eyes
kept
wandering
all
over
me
and
the
more
they
looked
the
less
they
seemed
able
to
make
me
out
at
last
i
raised
myself
upon
my
feet
and
leaning
upon
my
stick
i
spoke
whatever
came
into
my
head
to
the
man
who
seemed
foremost
among
them
i
spoke
in
english
though
i
was
very
sure
that
he
would
not
understand
i
said
that
i
had
no
idea
what
country
i
was
in
that
i
had
stumbled
upon
it
almost
by
accident
after
a
series
of
hairbreadth
escapes
and
that
i
trusted
they
would
not
allow
any
evil
to
overtake
me
now
that
i
was
completely
at
their
mercy
all
this
i
said
quietly
and
firmly
with
hardly
any
change
of
expression
they
could
not
understand
me
but
they
looked
approvingly
to
one
another
and
seemed
pleased
so
i
thought
that
i
showed
no
fear
nor
acknowledgment
of
inferiority
the
fact
being
that
i
was
exhausted
beyond
the
sense
of
fear
then
one
of
them
pointed
to
the
mountain
in
the
direction
of
the
statues
and
made
a
grimace
in
imitation
of
one
of
them
i
laughed
and
shuddered
expressively
whereon
they
all
burst
out
laughing
too
and
chattered
hard
to
one
another
i
could
make
out
nothing
of
what
they
said
but
i
think
they
thought
it
rather
a
good
joke
that
i
had
come
past
the
statues
then
one
among
them
came
forward
and
motioned
me
to
follow
which
i
did
without
hesitation
for
i
dared
not
thwart
them
moreover
i
liked
them
well
enough
and
felt
tolerably
sure
that
they
had
no
intention
of
hurting
me
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
got
to
a
small
hamlet
built
on
the
side
of
a
hill
with
a
narrow
street
and
houses
huddled
up
together
the
roofs
were
large
and
overhanging
some
few
windows
were
glazed
but
not
many
altogether
the
village
was
exceedingly
like
one
of
those
that
one
comes
upon
in
descending
the
less
known
passes
over
the
alps
on
to
lombardy
i
will
pass
over
the
excitement
which
my
arrival
caused
suffice
it
that
though
there
was
abundance
of
curiosity
there
was
no
rudeness
i
was
taken
to
the
principal
house
which
seemed
to
belong
to
the
people
who
had
captured
me
there
i
was
hospitably
entertained
and
a
supper
of
milk
and
goat
flesh
with
a
kind
of
oatcake
was
set
before
me
of
which
i
ate
heartily
but
all
the
time
i
was
eating
i
could
not
help
turning
my
eyes
upon
the
two
beautiful
girls
whom
i
had
first
seen
and
who
seemed
to
consider
me
as
their
lawful
prize
which
indeed
i
was
for
i
would
have
gone
through
fire
and
water
for
either
of
them
then
came
the
inevitable
surprise
at
seeing
me
smoke
which
i
will
spare
the
reader
but
i
noticed
that
when
they
saw
me
strike
a
match
there
was
a
hubbub
of
excitement
which
it
struck
me
was
not
altogether
unmixed
with
disapproval
why
i
could
not
guess
then
the
women
retired
and
i
was
left
alone
with
the
men
who
tried
to
talk
to
me
in
every
conceivable
way
but
we
could
come
to
no
understanding
except
that
i
was
quite
alone
and
had
come
from
a
long
way
over
the
mountains
in
the
course
of
time
they
grew
tired
and
i
very
sleepy
i
made
signs
as
though
i
would
sleep
on
the
floor
in
my
blankets
but
they
gave
me
one
of
their
bunks
with
plenty
of
dried
fern
and
grass
on
to
which
i
had
no
sooner
laid
myself
than
i
fell
fast
asleep
nor
did
i
awake
till
well
into
the
following
day
when
i
found
myself
in
the
hut
with
two
men
keeping
guard
over
me
and
an
old
woman
cooking
when
i
woke
the
men
seemed
pleased
and
spoke
to
me
as
though
bidding
me
good
morning
in
a
pleasant
tone
i
went
out
of
doors
to
wash
in
a
creek
which
ran
a
few
yards
from
the
house
my
hosts
were
as
engrossed
with
me
as
ever
they
never
took
their
eyes
off
me
following
every
action
that
i
did
no
matter
how
trifling
and
each
looking
towards
the
other
for
his
opinion
at
every
touch
and
turn
they
took
great
interest
in
my
ablutions
for
they
seemed
to
have
doubted
whether
i
was
in
all
respects
human
like
themselves
they
even
laid
hold
of
my
arms
and
overhauled
them
and
expressed
approval
when
they
saw
that
they
were
strong
and
muscular
they
now
examined
my
legs
and
especially
my
feet
when
they
desisted
they
nodded
approvingly
to
each
other
and
when
i
had
combed
and
brushed
my
hair
and
generally
made
myself
as
neat
and
well
arranged
as
circumstances
would
allow
i
could
see
that
their
respect
for
me
increased
greatly
and
that
they
were
by
no
means
sure
that
they
had
treated
me
with
sufficient
deference
a
matter
on
which
i
am
not
competent
to
decide
all
i
know
is
that
they
were
very
good
to
me
for
which
i
thanked
them
heartily
as
it
might
well
have
been
otherwise
for
my
own
part
i
liked
them
and
admired
them
for
their
quiet
and
dignified
ease
impressed
me
pleasurably
at
once
neither
did
their
manner
make
me
feel
as
though
i
were
personally
distasteful
to
them
only
that
i
was
a
thing
utterly
new
and
unlooked
for
which
they
could
not
comprehend
their
type
was
more
that
of
the
most
robust
italians
than
any
other
their
manners
also
were
eminently
italian
in
their
entire
unconsciousness
of
self
having
travelled
a
good
deal
in
italy
i
was
struck
with
little
gestures
of
the
hand
and
shoulders
which
constantly
reminded
me
of
that
country
my
feeling
was
that
my
wisest
plan
would
be
to
go
on
as
i
had
begun
and
be
simply
myself
for
better
or
worse
such
as
i
was
and
take
my
chance
accordingly
i
thought
of
these
things
while
they
were
waiting
for
me
to
have
done
washing
and
on
my
way
back
then
they
gave
me
breakfast
hot
bread
and
milk
and
fried
flesh
of
something
between
mutton
and
venison
their
ways
of
cooking
and
eating
were
european
though
they
had
only
a
skewer
for
a
fork
and
a
sort
of
butcher
knife
to
cut
with
the
more
i
looked
at
everything
in
the
house
the
more
i
was
struck
with
its
character
and
had
the
walls
only
been
pasted
over
with
extracts
from
the
london
and
i
could
have
almost
fancied
myself
in
a
shepherd
hut
upon
my
master
and
yet
everything
was
slightly
different
it
was
much
the
same
with
the
birds
and
flowers
on
the
other
side
as
compared
with
the
english
ones
on
my
arrival
i
had
been
pleased
at
noticing
that
nearly
all
the
plants
and
birds
were
very
like
common
english
ones
thus
there
was
a
robin
and
a
lark
and
a
wren
and
daisies
and
dandelions
not
quite
the
same
as
the
english
but
still
very
like
them
quite
like
enough
to
be
called
by
the
same
name
so
now
here
the
ways
of
these
two
men
and
the
things
they
had
in
the
house
were
all
very
nearly
the
same
as
in
europe
it
was
not
at
all
like
going
to
china
or
japan
where
everything
that
one
sees
is
strange
i
was
indeed
at
once
struck
with
the
primitive
character
of
their
appliances
for
they
seemed
to
be
some
five
or
six
hundred
years
behind
europe
in
their
inventions
but
this
is
the
case
in
many
an
italian
village
all
the
time
that
i
was
eating
my
breakfast
i
kept
speculating
as
to
what
family
of
mankind
they
could
belong
to
and
shortly
there
came
an
idea
into
my
head
which
brought
the
blood
into
my
cheeks
with
excitement
as
i
thought
of
it
was
it
possible
that
they
might
be
the
lost
ten
tribes
of
israel
of
whom
i
had
heard
both
my
grandfather
and
my
father
make
mention
as
existing
in
an
unknown
country
and
awaiting
a
final
return
to
palestine
was
it
possible
that
i
might
have
been
designed
by
providence
as
the
instrument
of
their
conversion
oh
what
a
thought
was
this
i
laid
down
my
skewer
and
gave
them
a
hasty
survey
there
was
nothing
of
a
jewish
type
about
them
their
noses
were
distinctly
grecian
and
their
lips
though
full
were
not
jewish
how
could
i
settle
this
question
i
knew
neither
greek
nor
hebrew
and
even
if
i
should
get
to
understand
the
language
here
spoken
i
should
be
unable
to
detect
the
roots
of
either
of
these
tongues
i
had
not
been
long
enough
among
them
to
ascertain
their
habits
but
they
did
not
give
me
the
impression
of
being
a
religious
people
this
too
was
natural
the
ten
tribes
had
been
always
lamentably
irreligious
but
could
i
not
make
them
change
to
restore
the
lost
ten
tribes
of
israel
to
a
knowledge
of
the
only
truth
here
would
be
indeed
an
immortal
crown
of
glory
my
heart
beat
fast
and
furious
as
i
entertained
the
thought
what
a
position
would
it
not
ensure
me
in
the
next
world
or
perhaps
even
in
this
what
folly
it
would
be
to
throw
such
a
chance
away
i
should
rank
next
to
the
apostles
if
not
as
high
as
they
certainly
above
the
minor
prophets
and
possibly
above
any
old
testament
writer
except
moses
and
isaiah
for
such
a
future
as
this
i
would
sacrifice
all
that
i
have
without
a
moment
hesitation
could
i
be
reasonably
assured
of
it
i
had
always
cordially
approved
of
missionary
efforts
and
had
at
times
contributed
my
mite
towards
their
support
and
extension
but
i
had
never
hitherto
felt
drawn
towards
becoming
a
missionary
myself
and
indeed
had
always
admired
and
envied
and
respected
them
more
than
i
had
exactly
liked
them
but
if
these
people
were
the
lost
ten
tribes
of
israel
the
case
would
be
widely
different
the
opening
was
too
excellent
to
be
lost
and
i
resolved
that
should
i
see
indications
which
appeared
to
confirm
my
impression
that
i
had
indeed
come
upon
the
missing
tribes
i
would
certainly
convert
them
i
may
here
mention
that
this
discovery
is
the
one
to
which
i
alluded
in
the
opening
pages
of
my
story
time
strengthened
the
impression
made
upon
me
at
first
and
though
i
remained
in
doubt
for
several
months
i
feel
now
no
longer
uncertain
when
i
had
done
eating
my
hosts
approached
and
pointed
down
the
valley
leading
to
their
own
country
as
though
wanting
to
show
that
i
must
go
with
them
at
the
same
time
they
laid
hold
of
my
arms
and
made
as
though
they
would
take
me
but
used
no
violence
i
laughed
and
motioned
my
hand
across
my
throat
pointing
down
the
valley
as
though
i
was
afraid
lest
i
should
be
killed
when
i
got
there
but
they
divined
me
at
once
and
shook
their
heads
with
much
decision
to
show
that
i
was
in
no
danger
their
manner
quite
reassured
me
and
in
half
an
hour
or
so
i
had
packed
up
my
swag
and
was
eager
for
the
forward
journey
feeling
wonderfully
strengthened
and
refreshed
by
good
food
and
sleep
while
my
hope
and
curiosity
were
aroused
to
their
very
utmost
by
the
extraordinary
position
in
which
i
found
myself
but
already
my
excitement
had
begun
to
cool
and
i
reflected
that
these
people
might
not
be
the
ten
tribes
after
all
in
which
case
i
could
not
but
regret
that
my
hopes
of
making
money
which
had
led
me
into
so
much
trouble
and
danger
were
almost
annihilated
by
the
fact
that
the
country
was
full
to
overflowing
with
a
people
who
had
probably
already
developed
its
more
available
resources
moreover
how
was
i
to
get
back
for
there
was
something
about
my
hosts
which
told
me
that
they
had
got
me
and
meant
to
keep
me
in
spite
of
all
their
goodness
chapter
vii
first
impressions
we
followed
an
alpine
path
for
some
four
miles
now
hundreds
of
feet
above
a
brawling
stream
which
descended
from
the
glaciers
and
now
nearly
alongside
it
the
morning
was
cold
and
somewhat
foggy
for
the
autumn
had
made
great
strides
latterly
sometimes
we
went
through
forests
of
pine
or
rather
yew
trees
though
they
looked
like
pine
and
i
remember
that
now
and
again
we
passed
a
little
wayside
shrine
wherein
there
would
be
a
statue
of
great
beauty
representing
some
figure
male
or
female
in
the
very
heyday
of
youth
strength
and
beauty
or
of
the
most
dignified
maturity
and
old
age
my
hosts
always
bowed
their
heads
as
they
passed
one
of
these
shrines
and
it
shocked
me
to
see
statues
that
had
no
apparent
object
beyond
the
chronicling
of
some
unusual
individual
excellence
or
beauty
receive
so
serious
a
homage
however
i
showed
no
sign
of
wonder
or
disapproval
for
i
remembered
that
to
be
all
things
to
all
men
was
one
of
the
injunctions
of
the
gentile
apostle
which
for
the
present
i
should
do
well
to
heed
shortly
after
passing
one
of
these
chapels
we
came
suddenly
upon
a
village
which
started
up
out
of
the
mist
and
i
was
alarmed
lest
i
should
be
made
an
object
of
curiosity
or
dislike
but
it
was
not
so
my
guides
spoke
to
many
in
passing
and
those
spoken
to
showed
much
amazement
my
guides
however
were
well
known
and
the
natural
politeness
of
the
people
prevented
them
from
putting
me
to
any
inconvenience
but
they
could
not
help
eyeing
me
nor
i
them
i
may
as
well
say
at
once
what
my
taught
me
namely
that
with
all
their
faults
and
extraordinary
obliquity
of
mental
vision
upon
many
subjects
they
are
the
very
people
that
i
ever
fell
in
with
the
village
was
just
like
the
one
we
had
left
only
rather
larger
the
streets
were
narrow
and
unpaved
but
very
fairly
clean
the
vine
grew
outside
many
of
the
houses
and
there
were
some
with
on
which
was
painted
a
bottle
and
a
glass
that
made
me
feel
much
at
home
even
on
this
ledge
of
human
society
there
was
a
stunted
growth
of
shoplets
which
had
taken
root
and
vegetated
somehow
though
as
in
an
air
mercantile
of
the
bleakest
it
was
here
as
hitherto
all
things
were
generically
the
same
as
in
europe
the
differences
being
of
species
only
and
i
was
amused
at
seeing
in
a
window
some
bottles
with
and
sweetmeats
for
children
as
at
home
but
the
was
in
plates
not
in
twisted
sticks
and
was
coloured
blue
glass
was
plentiful
in
the
better
houses
lastly
i
should
say
that
the
people
were
of
a
physical
beauty
which
was
simply
amazing
i
never
saw
anything
in
the
least
comparable
to
them
the
women
were
vigorous
and
had
a
most
majestic
gait
their
heads
being
set
upon
their
shoulders
with
a
grace
beyond
all
power
of
expression
each
feature
was
finished
eyelids
eyelashes
and
ears
being
almost
invariably
perfect
their
colour
was
equal
to
that
of
the
finest
italian
paintings
being
of
the
clearest
olive
and
yet
ruddy
with
a
glow
of
perfect
health
their
expression
was
divine
and
as
they
glanced
at
me
timidly
but
with
parted
lips
in
great
bewilderment
i
forgot
all
thoughts
of
their
conversion
in
feelings
that
were
far
more
earthly
i
was
dazzled
as
i
saw
one
after
the
other
of
whom
i
could
only
feel
that
each
was
the
loveliest
i
had
ever
seen
even
in
middle
age
they
were
still
comely
and
the
old
women
at
their
cottage
doors
had
a
dignity
not
to
say
majesty
of
their
own
the
men
were
as
handsome
as
the
women
beautiful
i
have
always
delighted
in
and
reverenced
beauty
but
i
felt
simply
abashed
in
the
presence
of
such
a
splendid
type
a
compound
of
all
that
is
best
in
egyptian
greek
and
italian
the
children
were
infinite
in
number
and
exceedingly
merry
i
need
hardly
say
that
they
came
in
for
their
full
share
of
the
prevailing
beauty
i
expressed
by
signs
my
admiration
and
pleasure
to
my
guides
and
they
were
greatly
pleased
i
should
add
that
all
seemed
to
take
a
pride
in
their
personal
appearance
and
that
even
the
poorest
and
none
seemed
rich
were
well
kempt
and
tidy
i
could
fill
many
pages
with
a
description
of
their
dress
and
the
ornaments
which
they
wore
and
a
hundred
details
which
struck
me
with
all
the
force
of
novelty
but
i
must
not
stay
to
do
so
when
we
had
got
past
the
village
the
fog
rose
and
revealed
magnificent
views
of
the
snowy
mountains
and
their
nearer
abutments
while
in
front
i
could
now
and
again
catch
glimpses
of
the
great
plains
which
i
had
surveyed
on
the
preceding
evening
the
country
was
highly
cultivated
every
ledge
being
planted
with
chestnuts
walnuts
and
from
which
the
apples
were
now
gathering
goats
were
abundant
also
a
kind
of
small
black
cattle
in
the
marshes
near
the
river
which
was
now
fast
widening
and
running
between
larger
flats
from
which
the
hills
receded
more
and
more
i
saw
a
few
sheep
with
rounded
noses
and
enormous
tails
dogs
were
there
in
plenty
and
very
english
but
i
saw
no
cats
nor
indeed
are
these
creatures
known
their
place
being
supplied
by
a
sort
of
small
terrier
in
about
four
hours
of
walking
from
the
time
we
started
and
after
passing
two
or
three
more
villages
we
came
upon
a
considerable
town
and
my
guides
made
many
attempts
to
make
me
understand
something
but
i
gathered
no
inkling
of
their
meaning
except
that
i
need
be
under
no
apprehension
of
danger
i
will
spare
the
reader
any
description
of
the
town
and
would
only
bid
him
think
of
domodossola
or
faido
suffice
it
that
i
found
myself
taken
before
the
chief
magistrate
and
by
his
orders
was
placed
in
an
apartment
with
two
other
people
who
were
the
first
i
had
seen
looking
anything
but
well
and
handsome
in
fact
one
of
them
was
plainly
very
much
out
of
health
and
coughed
violently
from
time
to
time
in
spite
of
manifest
efforts
to
suppress
it
the
other
looked
pale
and
ill
but
he
was
marvellously
and
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
was
the
matter
with
him
both
of
them
appeared
astonished
at
seeing
one
who
was
evidently
a
stranger
but
they
were
too
ill
to
come
up
to
me
and
form
conclusions
concerning
me
these
two
were
first
called
out
and
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
was
made
to
follow
them
which
i
did
in
some
fear
and
with
much
curiosity
the
chief
magistrate
was
a
man
with
white
hair
and
beard
and
a
face
of
great
sagacity
he
looked
me
all
over
for
about
five
minutes
letting
his
eyes
wander
from
the
crown
of
my
head
to
the
soles
of
my
feet
up
and
down
and
down
and
up
neither
did
his
mind
seem
in
the
least
clearer
when
he
had
done
looking
than
when
he
began
he
at
length
asked
me
a
single
short
question
which
i
supposed
meant
who
are
you
i
answered
in
english
quite
composedly
as
though
he
would
understand
me
and
endeavoured
to
be
my
very
most
natural
self
as
well
as
i
could
he
appeared
more
and
more
puzzled
and
then
retired
returning
with
two
others
much
like
himself
then
they
took
me
into
an
inner
room
and
the
two
fresh
arrivals
stripped
me
while
the
chief
looked
on
they
felt
my
pulse
they
looked
at
my
tongue
they
listened
at
my
chest
they
felt
all
my
muscles
and
at
the
end
of
each
operation
they
looked
at
the
chief
and
nodded
and
said
something
in
a
tone
quite
pleasant
as
though
i
were
all
right
they
even
pulled
down
my
eyelids
and
looked
i
suppose
to
see
if
they
were
bloodshot
but
it
was
not
so
at
length
they
gave
up
and
i
think
that
all
were
satisfied
of
my
being
in
the
most
perfect
health
and
very
robust
to
boot
at
last
the
old
magistrate
made
me
a
speech
of
about
five
minutes
long
which
the
other
two
appeared
to
think
greatly
to
the
point
but
from
which
i
gathered
nothing
as
soon
as
it
was
ended
they
proceeded
to
overhaul
my
swag
and
the
contents
of
my
pockets
this
gave
me
little
uneasiness
for
i
had
no
money
with
me
nor
anything
which
they
were
at
all
likely
to
want
or
which
i
cared
about
losing
at
least
i
fancied
so
but
i
soon
found
my
mistake
they
got
on
comfortably
at
first
though
they
were
much
puzzled
with
my
and
insisted
on
seeing
me
use
it
when
i
had
shown
them
what
i
did
with
it
they
were
astonished
but
not
displeased
and
seemed
to
like
the
smell
but
by
and
by
they
came
to
my
watch
which
i
had
hidden
away
in
the
inmost
pocket
that
i
had
and
had
forgotten
when
they
began
their
search
they
seemed
concerned
and
uneasy
as
soon
as
they
got
hold
of
it
they
then
made
me
open
it
and
show
the
works
and
when
i
had
done
so
they
gave
signs
of
very
grave
displeasure
which
disturbed
me
all
the
more
because
i
could
not
conceive
wherein
it
could
have
offended
them
i
remember
that
when
they
first
found
it
i
had
thought
of
paley
and
how
he
tells
us
that
a
savage
on
seeing
a
watch
would
at
once
conclude
that
it
was
designed
true
these
people
were
not
savages
but
i
none
the
less
felt
sure
that
this
was
the
conclusion
they
would
arrive
at
and
i
was
thinking
what
a
wonderfully
wise
man
archbishop
paley
must
have
been
when
i
was
aroused
by
a
look
of
horror
and
dismay
upon
the
face
of
the
magistrate
a
look
which
conveyed
to
me
the
impression
that
he
regarded
my
watch
not
as
having
been
designed
but
rather
as
the
designer
of
himself
and
of
the
universe
or
as
at
any
rate
one
of
the
great
first
causes
of
all
things
then
it
struck
me
that
this
view
was
quite
as
likely
to
be
taken
as
the
other
by
a
people
who
had
no
experience
of
european
civilisation
and
i
was
a
little
piqued
with
paley
for
having
led
me
so
much
astray
but
i
soon
discovered
that
i
had
misinterpreted
the
expression
on
the
magistrate
face
and
that
it
was
one
not
of
fear
but
hatred
he
spoke
to
me
solemnly
and
sternly
for
two
or
three
minutes
then
reflecting
that
this
was
of
no
use
he
caused
me
to
be
conducted
through
several
passages
into
a
large
room
which
i
afterwards
found
was
the
museum
of
the
town
and
wherein
i
beheld
a
sight
which
astonished
me
more
than
anything
that
i
had
yet
seen
it
was
filled
with
cases
containing
all
manner
of
curiosities
such
as
skeletons
stuffed
birds
and
animals
carvings
in
stone
whereof
i
saw
several
that
were
like
those
on
the
saddle
only
smaller
but
the
greater
part
of
the
room
was
occupied
by
broken
machinery
of
all
descriptions
the
larger
specimens
had
a
case
to
themselves
and
tickets
with
writing
on
them
in
a
character
which
i
could
not
understand
there
were
fragments
of
steam
engines
all
broken
and
rusted
among
them
i
saw
a
cylinder
and
piston
a
broken
and
part
of
a
crank
which
was
laid
on
the
ground
by
their
side
again
there
was
a
very
old
carriage
whose
wheels
in
spite
of
rust
and
decay
i
could
see
had
been
designed
originally
for
iron
rails
indeed
there
were
fragments
of
a
great
many
of
our
own
most
advanced
inventions
but
they
seemed
all
to
be
several
hundred
years
old
and
to
be
placed
where
they
were
not
for
instruction
but
curiosity
as
i
said
before
all
were
marred
and
broken
we
passed
many
cases
and
at
last
came
to
one
in
which
there
were
several
clocks
and
two
or
three
old
watches
here
the
magistrate
stopped
and
opening
the
case
began
comparing
my
watch
with
the
others
the
design
was
different
but
the
thing
was
clearly
the
same
on
this
he
turned
to
me
and
made
me
a
speech
in
a
severe
and
injured
tone
of
voice
pointing
repeatedly
to
the
watches
in
the
case
and
to
my
own
neither
did
he
seem
in
the
least
appeased
until
i
made
signs
to
him
that
he
had
better
take
my
watch
and
put
it
with
the
others
this
had
some
effect
in
calming
him
i
said
in
english
trusting
to
tone
and
manner
to
convey
my
meaning
that
i
was
exceedingly
sorry
if
i
had
been
found
to
have
anything
contraband
in
my
possession
that
i
had
had
no
intention
of
evading
the
ordinary
tolls
and
that
i
would
gladly
forfeit
the
watch
if
my
doing
so
would
atone
for
an
unintentional
violation
of
the
law
he
began
presently
to
relent
and
spoke
to
me
in
a
kinder
manner
i
think
he
saw
that
i
had
offended
without
knowledge
but
i
believe
the
chief
thing
that
brought
him
round
was
my
not
seeming
to
be
afraid
of
him
although
i
was
quite
respectful
this
and
my
having
light
hair
and
complexion
on
which
he
had
remarked
previously
by
signs
as
every
one
else
had
done
i
afterwards
found
that
it
was
reckoned
a
very
great
merit
to
have
fair
hair
this
being
a
thing
of
the
rarest
possible
occurrence
and
greatly
admired
and
envied
in
all
who
were
possessed
of
it
however
that
might
be
my
watch
was
taken
from
me
but
our
peace
was
made
and
i
was
conducted
back
to
the
room
where
i
had
been
examined
the
magistrate
then
made
me
another
speech
whereon
i
was
taken
to
a
building
hard
by
which
i
soon
discovered
to
be
the
common
prison
of
the
town
but
in
which
an
apartment
was
assigned
me
separate
from
the
other
prisoners
the
room
contained
a
bed
table
and
chairs
also
a
fireplace
and
a
there
was
another
door
which
opened
on
to
a
balcony
with
a
flight
of
steps
descending
into
a
walled
garden
of
some
size
the
man
who
conducted
me
into
this
room
made
signs
to
me
that
i
might
go
down
and
walk
in
the
garden
whenever
i
pleased
and
intimated
that
i
should
shortly
have
something
brought
me
to
eat
i
was
allowed
to
retain
my
blankets
and
the
few
things
which
i
had
wrapped
inside
them
but
it
was
plain
that
i
was
to
consider
myself
a
prisoner
for
how
long
a
period
i
could
not
by
any
means
determine
he
then
left
me
alone
chapter
viii
in
prison
and
now
for
the
first
time
my
courage
completely
failed
me
it
is
enough
to
say
that
i
was
penniless
and
a
prisoner
in
a
foreign
country
where
i
had
no
friend
nor
any
knowledge
of
the
customs
or
language
of
the
people
i
was
at
the
mercy
of
men
with
whom
i
had
little
in
common
and
yet
engrossed
as
i
was
with
my
extremely
difficult
and
doubtful
position
i
could
not
help
feeling
deeply
interested
in
the
people
among
whom
i
had
fallen
what
was
the
meaning
of
that
room
full
of
old
machinery
which
i
had
just
seen
and
of
the
displeasure
with
which
the
magistrate
had
regarded
my
watch
the
people
had
very
little
machinery
now
i
had
been
struck
with
this
over
and
over
again
though
i
had
not
been
more
than
hours
in
the
country
they
were
about
as
far
advanced
as
europeans
of
the
twelfth
or
thirteenth
century
certainly
not
more
so
and
yet
they
must
have
had
at
one
time
the
fullest
knowledge
of
our
own
most
recent
inventions
how
could
it
have
happened
that
having
been
once
so
far
in
advance
they
were
now
as
much
behind
us
it
was
evident
that
it
was
not
from
ignorance
they
knew
my
watch
as
a
watch
when
they
saw
it
and
the
care
with
which
the
broken
machines
were
preserved
and
ticketed
proved
that
they
had
not
lost
the
recollection
of
their
former
civilisation
the
more
i
thought
the
less
i
could
understand
it
but
at
last
i
concluded
that
they
must
have
worked
out
their
mines
of
coal
and
iron
till
either
none
were
left
or
so
few
that
the
use
of
these
metals
was
restricted
to
the
very
highest
nobility
this
was
the
only
solution
i
could
think
of
and
though
i
afterwards
found
how
entirely
mistaken
it
was
i
felt
quite
sure
then
that
it
must
be
the
right
one
i
had
hardly
arrived
at
this
opinion
for
above
four
or
five
minutes
when
the
door
opened
and
a
young
woman
made
her
appearance
with
a
tray
and
a
very
appetising
smell
of
dinner
i
gazed
upon
her
with
admiration
as
she
laid
a
cloth
and
set
a
dish
upon
the
table
as
i
beheld
her
i
felt
as
though
my
position
was
already
much
ameliorated
for
the
very
sight
of
her
carried
great
comfort
she
was
not
more
than
twenty
rather
above
the
middle
height
active
and
strong
but
yet
most
delicately
featured
her
lips
were
full
and
sweet
her
eyes
were
of
a
deep
hazel
and
fringed
with
long
and
springing
eyelashes
her
hair
was
neatly
braided
from
off
her
forehead
her
complexion
was
simply
exquisite
her
figure
as
robust
as
was
consistent
with
the
most
perfect
female
beauty
yet
not
more
so
her
hands
and
feet
might
have
served
as
models
to
a
sculptor
having
set
the
stew
upon
the
table
she
retired
with
a
glance
of
pity
whereon
remembering
pity
kinsman
i
decided
that
she
should
pity
me
a
little
more
she
returned
with
a
bottle
and
a
glass
and
found
me
sitting
on
the
bed
with
my
hands
over
my
face
looking
the
very
picture
of
abject
misery
and
like
all
pictures
rather
untruthful
as
i
watched
her
through
my
fingers
out
of
the
room
again
i
felt
sure
that
she
was
exceedingly
sorry
for
me
her
back
being
turned
i
set
to
work
and
ate
my
dinner
which
was
excellent
she
returned
in
about
an
hour
to
take
away
and
there
came
with
her
a
man
who
had
a
great
bunch
of
keys
at
his
waist
and
whose
manner
convinced
me
that
he
was
the
jailor
i
afterwards
found
that
he
was
father
to
the
beautiful
creature
who
had
brought
me
my
dinner
i
am
not
a
much
greater
hypocrite
than
other
people
and
do
what
i
would
i
could
not
look
so
very
miserable
i
had
already
recovered
from
my
dejection
and
felt
in
a
most
genial
humour
both
with
my
jailor
and
his
daughter
i
thanked
them
for
their
attention
towards
me
and
though
they
could
not
understand
they
looked
at
one
another
and
laughed
and
chattered
till
the
old
man
said
something
or
other
which
i
suppose
was
a
joke
for
the
girl
laughed
merrily
and
ran
away
leaving
her
father
to
take
away
the
dinner
things
then
i
had
another
visitor
who
was
not
so
prepossessing
and
who
seemed
to
have
a
great
idea
of
himself
and
a
small
one
of
me
he
brought
a
book
with
him
and
pens
and
paper
all
very
english
and
yet
neither
paper
nor
printing
nor
binding
nor
pen
nor
ink
were
quite
the
same
as
ours
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
was
to
teach
me
the
language
and
that
we
were
to
begin
at
once
this
delighted
me
both
because
i
should
be
more
comfortable
when
i
could
understand
and
make
myself
understood
and
because
i
supposed
that
the
authorities
would
hardly
teach
me
the
language
if
they
intended
any
cruel
usage
towards
me
afterwards
we
began
at
once
and
i
learnt
the
names
of
everything
in
the
room
and
also
the
numerals
and
personal
pronouns
i
found
to
my
sorrow
that
the
resemblance
to
european
things
which
i
had
so
frequently
observed
hitherto
did
not
hold
good
in
the
matter
of
language
for
i
could
detect
no
analogy
whatever
between
this
and
any
tongue
of
which
i
have
the
slightest
knowledge
a
thing
which
made
me
think
it
possible
that
i
might
be
learning
hebrew
i
must
detail
no
longer
from
this
time
my
days
were
spent
with
a
monotony
which
would
have
been
tedious
but
for
the
society
of
yram
the
jailor
daughter
who
had
taken
a
great
fancy
for
me
and
treated
me
with
the
utmost
kindness
the
man
came
every
day
to
teach
me
the
language
but
my
real
dictionary
and
grammar
were
yram
and
i
consulted
them
to
such
purpose
that
i
made
the
most
extraordinary
progress
being
able
at
the
end
of
a
month
to
understand
a
great
deal
of
the
conversation
which
i
overheard
between
yram
and
her
father
my
teacher
professed
himself
well
satisfied
and
said
he
should
make
a
favourable
report
of
me
to
the
authorities
i
then
questioned
him
as
to
what
would
probably
be
done
with
me
he
told
me
that
my
arrival
had
caused
great
excitement
throughout
the
country
and
that
i
was
to
be
detained
a
close
prisoner
until
the
receipt
of
advices
from
the
government
my
having
had
a
watch
he
said
was
the
only
damaging
feature
in
the
case
and
then
in
answer
to
my
asking
why
this
should
be
so
he
gave
me
a
long
story
of
which
with
my
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
language
i
could
make
nothing
whatever
except
that
it
was
a
very
heinous
offence
almost
as
bad
at
least
so
i
thought
i
understood
him
as
having
typhus
fever
but
he
said
he
thought
my
light
hair
would
save
me
i
was
allowed
to
walk
in
the
garden
there
was
a
high
wall
so
that
i
managed
to
play
a
sort
of
hand
fives
which
prevented
my
feeling
the
bad
effects
of
my
confinement
though
it
was
stupid
work
playing
alone
in
the
course
of
time
people
from
the
town
and
neighbourhood
began
to
pester
the
jailor
to
be
allowed
to
see
me
and
on
receiving
handsome
fees
he
let
them
do
so
the
people
were
good
to
me
almost
too
good
for
they
were
inclined
to
make
a
lion
of
me
which
i
hated
at
least
the
women
were
only
they
had
to
beware
of
yram
who
was
a
young
lady
of
a
jealous
temperament
and
kept
a
sharp
eye
both
on
me
and
on
my
lady
visitors
however
i
felt
so
kindly
towards
her
and
was
so
entirely
dependent
upon
her
for
almost
all
that
made
my
life
a
blessing
and
a
comfort
to
me
that
i
took
good
care
not
to
vex
her
and
we
remained
excellent
friends
the
men
were
far
less
inquisitive
and
would
not
i
believe
have
come
near
me
of
their
own
accord
but
the
women
made
them
come
as
escorts
i
was
delighted
with
their
handsome
mien
and
pleasant
genial
manners
my
food
was
plain
but
always
varied
and
wholesome
and
the
good
red
wine
was
admirable
i
had
found
a
sort
of
wort
in
the
garden
which
i
sweated
in
heaps
and
then
dried
obtaining
thus
a
substitute
for
tobacco
so
that
what
with
yram
the
language
visitors
fives
in
the
garden
smoking
and
bed
my
time
slipped
by
more
rapidly
and
pleasantly
than
might
have
been
expected
i
also
made
myself
a
small
flute
and
being
a
tolerable
player
amused
myself
at
times
with
playing
snatches
from
operas
and
airs
such
as
o
where
and
oh
where
and
home
sweet
home
this
was
of
great
advantage
to
me
for
the
people
of
the
country
were
ignorant
of
the
diatonic
scale
and
could
hardly
believe
their
ears
on
hearing
some
of
our
most
common
melodies
often
too
they
would
make
me
sing
and
i
could
at
any
time
make
yram
eyes
swim
with
tears
by
singing
wilkins
and
his
dinah
billy
taylor
the
ratcatcher
daughter
or
as
much
of
them
as
i
could
remember
i
had
one
or
two
discussions
with
them
because
i
never
would
sing
on
sunday
of
which
i
kept
count
in
my
except
chants
and
hymn
tunes
of
these
i
regret
to
say
that
i
had
forgotten
the
words
so
that
i
could
only
sing
the
tune
they
appeared
to
have
little
or
no
religious
feeling
and
to
have
never
so
much
as
heard
of
the
divine
institution
of
the
sabbath
so
they
ascribed
my
observance
of
it
to
a
fit
of
sulkiness
which
they
remarked
as
coming
over
me
upon
every
seventh
day
but
they
were
very
tolerant
and
one
of
them
said
to
me
quite
kindly
that
she
knew
how
impossible
it
was
to
help
being
sulky
at
times
only
she
thought
i
ought
to
see
some
one
if
it
became
more
serious
a
piece
of
advice
which
i
then
failed
to
understand
though
i
pretended
to
take
it
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
once
only
did
yram
treat
me
in
a
way
that
was
unkind
and
unreasonable
at
least
so
i
thought
it
at
the
time
it
happened
thus
i
had
been
playing
fives
in
the
garden
and
got
much
heated
although
the
day
was
cold
for
autumn
was
now
advancing
and
cold
harbour
as
the
name
of
the
town
in
which
my
prison
was
should
be
translated
stood
fully
feet
above
the
sea
i
had
played
without
my
coat
and
waistcoat
and
took
a
sharp
chill
on
resting
myself
too
long
in
the
open
air
without
protection
the
next
day
i
had
a
severe
cold
and
felt
really
poorly
being
little
used
even
to
the
lightest
ailments
and
thinking
that
it
would
be
rather
nice
to
be
petted
and
cossetted
by
yram
i
certainly
did
not
make
myself
out
to
be
any
better
than
i
was
in
fact
i
remember
that
i
made
the
worst
of
things
and
took
it
into
my
head
to
consider
myself
upon
the
sick
list
when
yram
brought
me
my
breakfast
i
complained
somewhat
dolefully
of
my
indisposition
expecting
the
sympathy
and
humouring
which
i
should
have
received
from
my
mother
and
sisters
at
home
not
a
bit
of
it
she
fired
up
in
an
instant
and
asked
me
what
i
meant
by
it
and
how
i
dared
to
presume
to
mention
such
a
thing
especially
when
i
considered
in
what
place
i
was
she
had
the
best
mind
to
tell
her
father
only
that
she
was
afraid
the
consequences
would
be
so
very
serious
for
me
her
manner
was
so
injured
and
decided
and
her
anger
so
evidently
unfeigned
that
i
forgot
my
cold
upon
the
spot
begging
her
by
all
means
to
tell
her
father
if
she
wished
to
do
so
and
telling
her
that
i
had
no
idea
of
being
shielded
by
her
from
anything
whatever
presently
mollifying
after
having
said
as
many
biting
things
as
i
could
i
asked
her
what
it
was
that
i
had
done
amiss
and
promised
amendment
as
soon
as
ever
i
became
aware
of
it
she
saw
that
i
was
really
ignorant
and
had
had
no
intention
of
being
rude
to
her
whereon
it
came
out
that
illness
of
any
sort
was
considered
in
erewhon
to
be
highly
criminal
and
immoral
and
that
i
was
liable
even
for
catching
cold
to
be
had
up
before
the
magistrates
and
imprisoned
for
a
considerable
period
an
announcement
which
struck
me
dumb
with
astonishment
i
followed
up
the
conversation
as
well
as
my
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
language
would
allow
and
caught
a
glimmering
of
her
position
with
regard
to
but
i
did
not
even
then
fully
comprehend
it
nor
had
i
as
yet
any
idea
of
the
other
extraordinary
perversions
of
thought
which
existed
among
the
erewhonians
but
with
which
i
was
soon
to
become
familiar
i
propose
therefore
to
make
no
mention
of
what
passed
between
us
on
this
occasion
save
that
we
were
reconciled
and
that
she
brought
me
surreptitiously
a
hot
glass
of
spirits
and
water
before
i
went
to
bed
as
also
a
pile
of
extra
blankets
and
that
next
morning
i
was
quite
well
i
never
remember
to
have
lost
a
cold
so
rapidly
this
little
affair
explained
much
which
had
hitherto
puzzled
me
it
seemed
that
the
two
men
who
were
examined
before
the
magistrates
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
in
the
country
had
been
given
in
charge
on
account
of
ill
health
and
were
both
condemned
to
a
long
term
of
imprisonment
with
hard
labour
they
were
now
expiating
their
offence
in
this
very
prison
and
their
exercise
ground
was
a
yard
separated
by
my
fives
wall
from
the
garden
in
which
i
walked
this
accounted
for
the
sounds
of
coughing
and
groaning
which
i
had
often
noticed
as
coming
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
it
was
high
and
i
had
not
dared
to
climb
it
for
fear
the
jailor
should
see
me
and
think
that
i
was
trying
to
escape
but
i
had
often
wondered
what
sort
of
people
they
could
be
on
the
other
side
and
had
resolved
on
asking
the
jailor
but
i
seldom
saw
him
and
yram
and
i
generally
found
other
things
to
talk
about
another
month
flew
by
during
which
i
made
such
progress
in
the
language
that
i
could
understand
all
that
was
said
to
me
and
express
myself
with
tolerable
fluency
my
instructor
professed
to
be
astonished
with
the
progress
i
had
made
i
was
careful
to
attribute
it
to
the
pains
he
had
taken
with
me
and
to
his
admirable
method
of
explaining
my
difficulties
so
we
became
excellent
friends
my
visitors
became
more
and
more
frequent
among
them
there
were
some
both
men
and
women
who
delighted
me
entirely
by
their
simplicity
unconsciousness
of
self
kindly
genial
manners
and
last
but
not
least
by
their
exquisite
beauty
there
came
others
less
but
still
comely
and
agreeable
people
while
some
were
snobs
pure
and
simple
at
the
end
of
the
third
month
the
jailor
and
my
instructor
came
together
to
visit
me
and
told
me
that
communications
had
been
received
from
the
government
to
the
effect
that
if
i
had
behaved
well
and
seemed
generally
reasonable
and
if
there
could
be
no
suspicion
at
all
about
my
bodily
health
and
vigour
and
if
my
hair
was
really
light
and
my
eyes
blue
and
complexion
fresh
i
was
to
be
sent
up
at
once
to
the
metropolis
in
order
that
the
king
and
queen
might
see
me
and
converse
with
me
but
that
when
i
arrived
there
i
should
be
set
at
liberty
and
a
suitable
allowance
would
be
made
me
my
teacher
also
told
me
that
one
of
the
leading
merchants
had
sent
me
an
invitation
to
repair
to
his
house
and
to
consider
myself
his
guest
for
as
long
a
time
as
i
chose
he
is
a
delightful
man
continued
the
interpreter
but
has
suffered
terribly
from
here
there
came
a
long
word
which
i
could
not
quite
catch
only
it
was
much
longer
than
kleptomania
and
has
but
lately
recovered
from
embezzling
a
large
sum
of
money
under
singularly
distressing
circumstances
but
he
has
quite
got
over
it
and
the
straighteners
say
that
he
has
made
a
really
wonderful
recovery
you
are
sure
to
like
him
chapter
ix
to
the
metropolis
with
the
above
words
the
good
man
left
the
room
before
i
had
time
to
express
my
astonishment
at
hearing
such
extraordinary
language
from
the
lips
of
one
who
seemed
to
be
a
reputable
member
of
society
embezzle
a
large
sum
of
money
under
singularly
distressing
circumstances
i
exclaimed
to
myself
and
ask
to
go
and
stay
with
him
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
compromise
myself
at
the
very
outset
in
the
eyes
of
all
decent
people
and
give
the
to
my
chances
of
either
converting
them
if
they
are
the
lost
tribes
of
israel
or
making
money
out
of
them
if
they
are
not
no
i
will
do
anything
rather
than
that
and
when
i
next
saw
my
teacher
i
told
him
that
i
did
not
at
all
like
the
sound
of
what
had
been
proposed
for
me
and
that
i
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
for
by
my
education
and
the
example
of
my
own
parents
and
i
trust
also
in
some
degree
from
inborn
instinct
i
have
a
very
genuine
dislike
for
all
unhandsome
dealings
in
money
matters
though
none
can
have
a
greater
regard
for
money
than
i
have
if
it
be
got
fairly
the
interpreter
was
much
surprised
by
my
answer
and
said
that
i
should
be
very
foolish
if
i
persisted
in
my
refusal
nosnibor
he
continued
is
a
man
of
at
least
for
their
way
of
reckoning
and
classifying
men
is
by
the
number
of
foot
pounds
which
they
have
money
enough
to
raise
or
more
roughly
by
their
and
keeps
a
capital
table
besides
his
two
daughters
are
among
the
most
beautiful
women
in
erewhon
when
i
heard
all
this
i
confess
that
i
was
much
shaken
and
inquired
whether
he
was
favourably
considered
in
the
best
society
certainly
was
the
answer
no
man
in
the
country
stands
higher
he
then
went
on
to
say
that
one
would
have
thought
from
my
manner
that
my
proposed
host
had
had
jaundice
or
pleurisy
or
been
generally
unfortunate
and
that
i
was
in
fear
of
infection
i
am
not
much
afraid
of
infection
said
i
impatiently
but
i
have
some
regard
for
my
character
and
if
i
know
a
man
to
be
an
embezzler
of
other
people
money
be
sure
of
it
i
will
give
him
as
wide
a
berth
as
i
can
if
he
were
ill
or
poor
ill
or
poor
interrupted
the
interpreter
with
a
face
of
great
alarm
so
that
your
notion
of
propriety
you
would
consort
with
the
basest
criminals
and
yet
deem
simple
embezzlement
a
bar
to
friendly
intercourse
i
can
not
understand
you
but
i
am
poor
myself
cried
i
you
were
said
he
and
you
were
liable
to
be
severely
punished
for
it
indeed
at
the
council
which
was
held
concerning
you
this
fact
was
very
nearly
consigning
you
to
what
i
should
myself
consider
a
chastisement
for
he
was
getting
angry
and
so
was
i
but
the
queen
was
so
inquisitive
and
wanted
so
much
to
see
you
that
she
petitioned
the
king
and
made
him
give
you
his
pardon
and
assign
you
a
pension
in
consideration
of
your
meritorious
complexion
it
is
lucky
for
you
that
he
has
not
heard
what
you
have
been
saying
now
or
he
would
be
sure
to
cancel
it
as
i
heard
these
words
my
heart
sank
within
me
i
felt
the
extreme
difficulty
of
my
position
and
how
wicked
i
should
be
in
running
counter
to
established
usage
i
remained
silent
for
several
minutes
and
then
said
that
i
should
be
happy
to
accept
the
embezzler
invitation
on
which
my
instructor
brightened
and
said
i
was
a
sensible
fellow
but
i
felt
very
uncomfortable
when
he
had
left
the
room
i
mused
over
the
conversation
which
had
just
taken
place
between
us
but
i
could
make
nothing
out
of
it
except
that
it
argued
an
even
greater
perversity
of
mental
vision
than
i
had
been
yet
prepared
for
and
this
made
me
wretched
for
i
can
not
bear
having
much
to
do
with
people
who
think
differently
from
myself
all
sorts
of
wandering
thoughts
kept
coming
into
my
head
i
thought
of
my
master
hut
and
my
seat
upon
the
mountain
side
where
i
had
first
conceived
the
insane
idea
of
exploring
what
years
and
years
seemed
to
have
passed
since
i
had
begun
my
journey
i
thought
of
my
adventures
in
the
gorge
and
on
the
journey
hither
and
of
chowbok
i
wondered
what
chowbok
told
them
about
me
when
he
got
back
he
had
done
well
in
going
back
chowbok
had
he
was
not
handsome
nay
he
was
hideous
and
it
would
have
gone
hardly
with
him
twilight
drew
on
and
rain
pattered
against
the
windows
never
yet
had
i
felt
so
unhappy
except
during
three
days
of
at
the
beginning
of
my
voyage
from
england
i
sat
musing
and
in
great
melancholy
until
yram
made
her
appearance
with
light
and
supper
she
too
poor
girl
was
miserable
for
she
had
heard
that
i
was
to
leave
them
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
i
was
to
remain
always
in
the
town
even
after
my
imprisonment
was
over
and
i
fancy
had
resolved
to
marry
me
though
i
had
never
so
much
as
hinted
at
her
doing
so
so
what
with
the
distressingly
strange
conversation
with
my
teacher
my
own
friendless
condition
and
yram
melancholy
i
felt
more
unhappy
than
i
can
describe
and
remained
so
till
i
got
to
bed
and
sleep
sealed
my
eyelids
on
awaking
next
morning
i
was
much
better
it
was
settled
that
i
was
to
make
my
start
in
a
conveyance
which
was
to
be
in
waiting
for
me
at
about
eleven
and
the
anticipation
of
change
put
me
in
good
spirits
which
even
the
tearful
face
of
yram
could
hardly
altogether
derange
i
kissed
her
again
and
again
assured
her
that
we
should
meet
hereafter
and
that
in
the
meanwhile
i
should
be
ever
mindful
of
her
kindness
i
gave
her
two
of
the
buttons
off
my
coat
and
a
lock
of
my
hair
as
a
keepsake
taking
a
goodly
curl
from
her
own
beautiful
head
in
return
and
so
having
said
a
hundred
times
till
i
was
fairly
overcome
with
her
great
sweetness
and
her
sorrow
i
tore
myself
away
from
her
and
got
to
the
caleche
which
was
in
waiting
how
thankful
i
was
when
it
was
all
over
and
i
was
driven
away
and
out
of
sight
would
that
i
could
have
felt
that
it
was
out
of
mind
also
pray
heaven
that
it
is
so
now
and
that
she
is
married
happily
among
her
own
people
and
has
forgotten
me
and
now
began
a
long
and
tedious
journey
with
which
i
should
hardly
trouble
the
reader
if
i
could
he
is
safe
however
for
the
simple
reason
that
i
was
blindfolded
during
the
greater
part
of
the
time
a
bandage
was
put
upon
my
eyes
every
morning
and
was
only
removed
at
night
when
i
reached
the
inn
at
which
we
were
to
pass
the
night
we
travelled
slowly
although
the
roads
were
good
we
drove
but
one
horse
which
took
us
our
day
journey
from
morning
till
evening
about
six
hours
exclusive
of
two
hours
rest
in
the
middle
of
the
day
i
do
not
suppose
we
made
above
thirty
or
miles
on
an
average
each
day
we
had
a
fresh
horse
as
i
have
said
already
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
country
i
only
know
that
it
was
level
and
that
several
times
we
had
to
cross
large
rivers
in
the
inns
were
clean
and
comfortable
in
one
or
two
of
the
larger
towns
they
were
quite
sumptuous
and
the
food
was
good
and
well
cooked
the
same
wonderful
health
and
grace
and
beauty
prevailed
everywhere
i
found
myself
an
object
of
great
interest
so
much
so
that
the
driver
told
me
he
had
to
keep
our
route
secret
and
at
times
to
go
to
places
that
were
not
directly
on
our
road
in
order
to
avoid
the
press
that
would
otherwise
have
awaited
us
every
evening
i
had
a
reception
and
grew
heartily
tired
of
having
to
say
the
same
things
over
and
over
again
in
answer
to
the
same
questions
but
it
was
impossible
to
be
angry
with
people
whose
manners
were
so
delightful
they
never
once
asked
after
my
health
or
even
whether
i
was
fatigued
with
my
journey
but
their
first
question
was
almost
invariably
an
inquiry
after
my
temper
the
of
which
astonished
me
till
i
became
used
to
it
one
day
being
tired
and
cold
and
weary
of
saying
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
i
turned
a
little
brusquely
on
my
questioner
and
said
that
i
was
exceedingly
cross
and
that
i
could
hardly
feel
in
a
worse
humour
with
myself
and
every
one
else
than
at
that
moment
to
my
surprise
i
was
met
with
the
kindest
expressions
of
condolence
and
heard
it
buzzed
about
the
room
that
i
was
in
an
ill
temper
whereon
people
began
to
give
me
nice
things
to
smell
and
to
eat
which
really
did
seem
to
have
some
mending
quality
about
them
for
i
soon
felt
pleased
and
was
at
once
congratulated
upon
being
better
the
next
morning
two
or
three
people
sent
their
servants
to
the
hotel
with
sweetmeats
and
inquiries
whether
i
had
quite
recovered
from
my
ill
humour
on
receiving
the
good
things
i
felt
in
half
a
mind
to
be
every
evening
but
i
disliked
the
condolences
and
the
inquiries
and
found
it
most
comfortable
to
keep
my
natural
temper
which
is
smooth
enough
generally
among
those
who
came
to
visit
me
were
some
who
had
received
a
liberal
education
at
the
colleges
of
unreason
and
taken
the
highest
degrees
in
hypothetics
which
are
their
principal
study
these
gentlemen
had
now
settled
down
to
various
employments
in
the
country
as
straighteners
managers
and
cashiers
of
the
musical
banks
priests
of
religion
or
what
not
and
carrying
their
education
with
them
they
diffused
a
leaven
of
culture
throughout
the
country
i
naturally
questioned
them
about
many
of
the
things
which
had
puzzled
me
since
my
arrival
i
inquired
what
was
the
object
and
meaning
of
the
statues
which
i
had
seen
upon
the
plateau
of
the
pass
i
was
told
that
they
dated
from
a
very
remote
period
and
that
there
were
several
other
such
groups
in
the
country
but
none
so
remarkable
as
the
one
which
i
had
seen
they
had
a
religious
origin
having
been
designed
to
propitiate
the
gods
of
deformity
and
disease
in
former
times
it
had
been
the
custom
to
make
expeditions
over
the
ranges
and
capture
the
ugliest
of
chowbok
ancestors
whom
they
could
find
in
order
to
sacrifice
them
in
the
presence
of
these
deities
and
thus
avert
ugliness
and
disease
from
the
erewhonians
themselves
it
had
been
whispered
but
my
informant
assured
me
untruly
that
centuries
ago
they
had
even
offered
up
some
of
their
own
people
who
were
ugly
or
out
of
health
in
order
to
make
examples
of
them
these
detestable
customs
however
had
been
long
discontinued
neither
was
there
any
present
observance
of
the
statues
i
had
the
curiosity
to
inquire
what
would
be
done
to
any
of
tribe
if
they
crossed
over
into
erewhon
i
was
told
that
nobody
knew
inasmuch
as
such
a
thing
had
not
happened
for
ages
they
would
be
too
ugly
to
be
allowed
to
go
at
large
but
not
so
much
so
as
to
be
criminally
liable
their
offence
in
having
come
would
be
a
moral
one
but
they
would
be
beyond
the
straightener
art
possibly
they
would
be
consigned
to
the
hospital
for
incurable
bores
and
made
to
work
at
being
bored
for
so
many
hours
a
day
by
the
erewhonian
inhabitants
of
the
hospital
who
are
extremely
impatient
of
one
another
boredom
but
would
soon
die
if
they
had
no
one
whom
they
might
bore
in
fact
that
they
would
be
kept
as
professional
borees
when
i
heard
this
it
occurred
to
me
that
some
rumours
of
its
substance
might
perhaps
have
become
current
among
chowbok
people
for
the
agony
of
his
fear
had
been
too
great
to
have
been
inspired
by
the
mere
dread
of
being
burnt
alive
before
the
statues
i
also
questioned
them
about
the
museum
of
old
machines
and
the
cause
of
the
apparent
retrogression
in
all
arts
sciences
and
inventions
i
learnt
that
about
four
hundred
years
previously
the
state
of
mechanical
knowledge
was
far
beyond
our
own
and
was
advancing
with
prodigious
rapidity
until
one
of
the
most
learned
professors
of
hypothetics
wrote
an
extraordinary
book
from
which
i
propose
to
give
extracts
later
on
proving
that
the
machines
were
ultimately
destined
to
supplant
the
race
of
man
and
to
become
instinct
with
a
vitality
as
different
from
and
superior
to
that
of
animals
as
animal
to
vegetable
life
so
convincing
was
his
reasoning
or
unreasoning
to
this
effect
that
he
carried
the
country
with
him
and
they
made
a
clean
sweep
of
all
machinery
that
had
not
been
in
use
for
more
than
two
hundred
and
years
which
period
was
arrived
at
after
a
series
of
compromises
and
strictly
forbade
all
further
improvements
and
inventions
under
pain
of
being
considered
in
the
eye
of
the
law
to
be
labouring
under
typhus
fever
which
they
regard
as
one
of
the
worst
of
all
crimes
this
is
the
only
case
in
which
they
have
confounded
mental
and
physical
diseases
and
they
do
it
even
here
as
by
an
avowed
legal
fiction
i
became
uneasy
when
i
remembered
about
my
watch
but
they
comforted
me
with
the
assurance
that
transgression
in
this
matter
was
now
so
unheard
of
that
the
law
could
afford
to
be
lenient
towards
an
utter
stranger
especially
towards
one
who
had
such
a
good
character
they
meant
physique
and
such
beautiful
light
hair
moreover
the
watch
was
a
real
curiosity
and
would
be
a
welcome
addition
to
the
metropolitan
collection
so
they
did
not
think
i
need
let
it
trouble
me
seriously
i
will
write
however
more
fully
upon
this
subject
when
i
deal
with
the
colleges
of
unreason
and
the
book
of
the
machines
in
about
a
month
from
the
time
of
our
starting
i
was
told
that
our
journey
was
nearly
over
the
bandage
was
now
dispensed
with
for
it
seemed
impossible
that
i
should
ever
be
able
to
find
my
way
back
without
being
captured
then
we
rolled
merrily
along
through
the
streets
of
a
handsome
town
and
got
on
to
a
long
broad
and
level
road
with
poplar
trees
on
either
side
the
road
was
raised
slightly
above
the
surrounding
country
and
had
formerly
been
a
railway
the
fields
on
either
side
were
in
the
highest
conceivable
cultivation
but
the
harvest
and
also
the
vintage
had
been
already
gathered
the
weather
had
got
cooler
more
rapidly
than
could
be
quite
accounted
for
by
the
progress
of
the
season
so
i
rather
thought
that
we
must
have
been
making
away
from
the
sun
and
were
some
degrees
farther
from
the
equator
than
when
we
started
even
here
the
vegetation
showed
that
the
climate
was
a
hot
one
yet
there
was
no
lack
of
vigour
among
the
people
on
the
contrary
they
were
a
very
hardy
race
and
capable
of
great
endurance
for
the
hundredth
time
i
thought
that
take
them
all
round
i
had
never
seen
their
equals
in
respect
of
physique
and
they
looked
as
as
they
were
robust
the
flowers
were
for
the
most
part
over
but
their
absence
was
in
some
measure
compensated
for
by
a
profusion
of
delicious
fruit
closely
resembling
the
figs
peaches
and
pears
of
italy
and
france
i
saw
no
wild
animals
but
birds
were
plentiful
and
much
as
in
europe
but
not
tame
as
they
had
been
on
the
other
side
the
ranges
they
were
shot
at
with
the
and
with
arrows
gunpowder
being
unknown
or
at
any
rate
not
in
use
we
were
now
nearing
the
metropolis
and
i
could
see
great
towers
and
fortifications
and
lofty
buildings
that
looked
like
palaces
i
began
to
be
nervous
as
to
my
reception
but
i
had
got
on
very
well
so
far
and
resolved
to
continue
upon
the
same
plan
as
hitherto
namely
to
behave
just
as
though
i
were
in
england
until
i
saw
that
i
was
making
a
blunder
and
then
to
say
nothing
till
i
could
gather
how
the
land
lay
we
drew
nearer
and
nearer
the
news
of
my
approach
had
got
abroad
and
there
was
a
great
crowd
collected
on
either
side
the
road
who
greeted
me
with
marks
of
most
respectful
curiosity
keeping
me
bowing
constantly
in
acknowledgement
from
side
to
side
when
we
were
about
a
mile
off
we
were
met
by
the
mayor
and
several
councillors
among
whom
was
a
venerable
old
man
who
was
introduced
to
me
by
the
mayor
for
so
i
suppose
i
should
call
him
as
the
gentleman
who
had
invited
me
to
his
house
i
bowed
deeply
and
told
him
how
grateful
i
felt
to
him
and
how
gladly
i
would
accept
his
hospitality
he
forbade
me
to
say
more
and
pointing
to
his
carriage
which
was
close
at
hand
he
motioned
me
to
a
seat
therein
i
again
bowed
profoundly
to
the
mayor
and
councillors
and
drove
off
with
my
entertainer
whose
name
was
senoj
nosnibor
after
about
half
a
mile
the
carriage
turned
off
the
main
road
and
we
drove
under
the
walls
of
the
town
till
we
reached
a
on
a
slight
eminence
and
just
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
this
was
senoj
nosnibor
house
and
nothing
can
be
imagined
finer
it
was
situated
near
the
magnificent
and
venerable
ruins
of
the
old
railway
station
which
formed
an
imposing
feature
from
the
gardens
of
the
house
the
grounds
some
ten
or
a
dozen
acres
in
extent
were
laid
out
in
terraced
gardens
one
above
the
other
with
flights
of
broad
steps
ascending
and
descending
the
declivity
of
the
garden
on
these
steps
there
were
statues
of
most
exquisite
workmanship
besides
the
statues
there
were
vases
filled
with
various
shrubs
that
were
new
to
me
and
on
either
side
the
flights
of
steps
there
were
rows
of
old
cypresses
and
cedars
with
grassy
alleys
between
them
then
came
choice
vineyards
and
orchards
of
in
full
bearing
the
house
itself
was
approached
by
a
and
round
it
was
a
corridor
on
to
which
rooms
opened
as
at
pompeii
in
the
middle
of
the
court
there
was
a
bath
and
a
fountain
having
passed
the
court
we
came
to
the
main
body
of
the
house
which
was
two
stories
in
height
the
rooms
were
large
and
lofty
perhaps
at
first
they
looked
rather
bare
of
furniture
but
in
hot
climates
people
generally
keep
their
rooms
more
bare
than
they
do
in
colder
ones
i
missed
also
the
sight
of
a
grand
piano
or
some
similar
instrument
there
being
no
means
of
producing
music
in
any
of
the
rooms
save
the
larger
where
there
were
half
a
dozen
large
bronze
gongs
which
the
ladies
used
occasionally
to
beat
about
at
random
it
was
not
pleasant
to
hear
them
but
i
have
heard
quite
as
unpleasant
music
both
before
and
since
nosnibor
took
me
through
several
spacious
rooms
till
we
reached
a
boudoir
where
were
his
wife
and
daughters
of
whom
i
had
heard
from
the
interpreter
nosnibor
was
about
forty
years
old
and
still
handsome
but
she
had
grown
very
stout
her
daughters
were
in
the
prime
of
youth
and
exquisitely
beautiful
i
gave
the
preference
almost
at
once
to
the
younger
whose
name
was
arowhena
for
the
elder
sister
was
haughty
while
the
younger
had
a
very
winning
manner
nosnibor
received
me
with
the
perfection
of
courtesy
so
that
i
must
have
indeed
been
shy
and
nervous
if
i
had
not
at
once
felt
welcome
scarcely
was
the
ceremony
of
my
introduction
well
completed
before
a
servant
announced
that
dinner
was
ready
in
the
next
room
i
was
exceedingly
hungry
and
the
dinner
was
beyond
all
praise
can
the
reader
wonder
that
i
began
to
consider
myself
in
excellent
quarters
that
man
embezzle
money
thought
i
to
myself
impossible
but
i
noticed
that
my
host
was
uneasy
during
the
whole
meal
and
that
he
ate
nothing
but
a
little
bread
and
milk
towards
the
end
of
dinner
there
came
a
tall
lean
man
with
a
black
beard
to
whom
nosnibor
and
the
whole
family
paid
great
attention
he
was
the
family
straightener
with
this
gentleman
nosnibor
retired
into
another
room
from
which
there
presently
proceeded
a
sound
of
weeping
and
wailing
i
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
but
in
a
few
minutes
i
got
to
know
for
a
certainty
that
they
came
from
nosnibor
himself
poor
papa
said
arowhena
as
she
helped
herself
composedly
to
the
salt
how
terribly
he
has
suffered
yes
answered
her
mother
but
i
think
he
is
quite
out
of
danger
now
then
they
went
on
to
explain
to
me
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
the
treatment
which
the
straightener
had
prescribed
and
how
successful
he
had
been
all
which
i
will
reserve
for
another
chapter
and
put
rather
in
the
form
of
a
general
summary
of
the
opinions
current
upon
these
subjects
than
in
the
exact
words
in
which
the
facts
were
delivered
to
me
the
reader
however
is
earnestly
requested
to
believe
that
both
in
this
next
chapter
and
in
those
that
follow
it
i
have
endeavoured
to
adhere
most
conscientiously
to
the
strictest
accuracy
and
that
i
have
never
willingly
misrepresented
though
i
may
have
sometimes
failed
to
understand
all
the
bearings
of
an
opinion
or
custom
chapter
x
current
opinions
this
is
what
i
gathered
that
in
that
country
if
a
man
falls
into
ill
health
or
catches
any
disorder
or
fails
bodily
in
any
way
before
he
is
seventy
years
old
he
is
tried
before
a
jury
of
his
countrymen
and
if
convicted
is
held
up
to
public
scorn
and
sentenced
more
or
less
severely
as
the
case
may
be
there
are
subdivisions
of
illnesses
into
crimes
and
misdemeanours
as
with
offences
amongst
ourselves
a
man
being
punished
very
heavily
for
serious
illness
while
failure
of
eyes
or
hearing
in
one
over
who
has
had
good
health
hitherto
is
dealt
with
by
fine
only
or
imprisonment
in
default
of
payment
but
if
a
man
forges
a
cheque
or
sets
his
house
on
fire
or
robs
with
violence
from
the
person
or
does
any
other
such
things
as
are
criminal
in
our
own
country
he
is
either
taken
to
a
hospital
and
most
carefully
tended
at
the
public
expense
or
if
he
is
in
good
circumstances
he
lets
it
be
known
to
all
his
friends
that
he
is
suffering
from
a
severe
fit
of
immorality
just
as
we
do
when
we
are
ill
and
they
come
and
visit
him
with
great
solicitude
and
inquire
with
interest
how
it
all
came
about
what
symptoms
first
showed
themselves
and
so
forth
questions
which
he
will
answer
with
perfect
unreserve
for
bad
conduct
though
considered
no
less
deplorable
than
illness
with
ourselves
and
as
unquestionably
indicating
something
seriously
wrong
with
the
individual
who
misbehaves
is
nevertheless
held
to
be
the
result
of
either
or
misfortune
the
strange
part
of
the
story
however
is
that
though
they
ascribe
moral
defects
to
the
effect
of
misfortune
either
in
character
or
surroundings
they
will
not
listen
to
the
plea
of
misfortune
in
cases
that
in
england
meet
with
sympathy
and
commiseration
only
ill
luck
of
any
kind
or
even
ill
treatment
at
the
hands
of
others
is
considered
an
offence
against
society
inasmuch
as
it
makes
people
uncomfortable
to
hear
of
it
loss
of
fortune
therefore
or
loss
of
some
dear
friend
on
whom
another
was
much
dependent
is
punished
hardly
less
severely
than
physical
delinquency
foreign
indeed
as
such
ideas
are
to
our
own
traces
of
somewhat
similar
opinions
can
be
found
even
in
england
if
a
person
has
an
abscess
the
medical
man
will
say
that
it
contains
peccant
matter
and
people
say
that
they
have
a
bad
arm
or
finger
or
that
they
are
very
bad
all
over
when
they
only
mean
diseased
among
foreign
nations
erewhonian
opinions
may
be
still
more
clearly
noted
the
mahommedans
for
example
to
this
day
send
their
female
prisoners
to
hospitals
and
the
new
zealand
maories
visit
any
misfortune
with
forcible
entry
into
the
house
of
the
offender
and
the
breaking
up
and
burning
of
all
his
goods
the
italians
again
use
the
same
word
for
disgrace
and
misfortune
i
once
heard
an
italian
lady
speak
of
a
young
friend
whom
she
described
as
endowed
with
every
virtue
under
heaven
ma
she
exclaimed
povero
disgraziato
ha
ammazzato
suo
zio
poor
unfortunate
fellow
he
has
murdered
his
uncle
on
mentioning
this
which
i
heard
when
taken
to
italy
as
a
boy
by
my
father
the
person
to
whom
i
told
it
showed
no
surprise
he
said
that
he
had
been
driven
for
two
or
three
years
in
a
certain
city
by
a
young
sicilian
cabdriver
of
prepossessing
manners
and
appearance
but
then
lost
sight
of
him
on
asking
what
had
become
of
him
he
was
told
that
he
was
in
prison
for
having
shot
at
his
father
with
intent
to
kill
him
happily
without
serious
result
some
years
later
my
informant
again
found
himself
warmly
accosted
by
the
prepossessing
young
cabdriver
ah
caro
signore
he
exclaimed
sono
cinque
anni
che
non
lo
vedo
tre
anni
di
militare
e
due
anni
di
disgrazia
my
dear
sir
it
is
five
years
since
i
saw
you
three
years
of
military
service
and
two
of
misfortune
during
which
last
the
poor
fellow
had
been
in
prison
of
moral
sense
he
showed
not
so
much
as
a
trace
he
and
his
father
were
now
on
excellent
terms
and
were
likely
to
remain
so
unless
either
of
them
should
again
have
the
misfortune
mortally
to
offend
the
other
in
the
following
chapter
i
will
give
a
few
examples
of
the
way
in
which
what
we
should
call
misfortune
hardship
or
disease
are
dealt
with
by
the
erewhonians
but
for
the
moment
will
return
to
their
treatment
of
cases
that
with
us
are
criminal
as
i
have
already
said
these
though
not
judicially
punishable
are
recognised
as
requiring
correction
accordingly
there
exists
a
class
of
men
trained
in
whom
they
call
straighteners
as
nearly
as
i
can
translate
a
word
which
literally
means
one
who
bends
back
the
crooked
these
men
practise
much
as
medical
men
in
england
and
receive
a
fee
on
every
visit
they
are
treated
with
the
same
unreserve
and
obeyed
as
readily
as
our
own
doctors
that
is
to
say
on
the
whole
sufficiently
because
people
know
that
it
is
their
interest
to
get
well
as
soon
as
they
can
and
that
they
will
not
be
scouted
as
they
would
be
if
their
bodies
were
out
of
order
even
though
they
may
have
to
undergo
a
very
painful
course
of
treatment
when
i
say
that
they
will
not
be
scouted
i
do
not
mean
that
an
erewhonian
will
suffer
no
social
inconvenience
in
consequence
we
will
say
of
having
committed
fraud
friends
will
fall
away
from
him
because
of
his
being
less
pleasant
company
just
as
we
ourselves
are
disinclined
to
make
companions
of
those
who
are
either
poor
or
poorly
no
one
with
any
sense
of
will
place
himself
on
an
equality
in
the
matter
of
affection
with
those
who
are
less
lucky
than
himself
in
birth
health
money
good
looks
capacity
or
anything
else
indeed
that
dislike
and
even
disgust
should
be
felt
by
the
fortunate
for
the
unfortunate
or
at
any
rate
for
those
who
have
been
discovered
to
have
met
with
any
of
the
more
serious
and
less
familiar
misfortunes
is
not
only
natural
but
desirable
for
any
society
whether
of
man
or
brute
the
fact
therefore
that
the
erewhonians
attach
none
of
that
guilt
to
crime
which
they
do
to
physical
ailments
does
not
prevent
the
more
selfish
among
them
from
neglecting
a
friend
who
has
robbed
a
bank
for
instance
till
he
has
fully
recovered
but
it
does
prevent
them
from
even
thinking
of
treating
criminals
with
that
contemptuous
tone
which
would
seem
to
say
i
if
i
were
you
should
be
a
better
man
than
you
are
a
tone
which
is
held
quite
reasonable
in
regard
to
physical
ailment
hence
though
they
conceal
ill
health
by
every
cunning
and
hypocrisy
and
artifice
which
they
can
devise
they
are
quite
open
about
the
most
flagrant
mental
diseases
should
they
happen
to
exist
which
to
do
the
people
justice
is
not
often
indeed
there
are
some
who
are
so
to
speak
spiritual
valetudinarians
and
who
make
themselves
exceedingly
ridiculous
by
their
nervous
supposition
that
they
are
wicked
while
they
are
very
tolerable
people
all
the
time
this
however
is
exceptional
and
on
the
whole
they
use
much
the
same
reserve
or
unreserve
about
the
state
of
their
moral
welfare
as
we
do
about
our
health
hence
all
the
ordinary
greetings
among
ourselves
such
as
how
do
you
do
and
the
like
are
considered
signs
of
gross
nor
do
the
politer
classes
tolerate
even
such
a
common
complimentary
remark
as
telling
a
man
that
he
is
looking
well
they
salute
each
other
with
i
hope
you
are
good
this
morning
or
i
hope
you
have
recovered
from
the
snappishness
from
which
you
were
suffering
when
i
last
saw
you
and
if
the
person
saluted
has
not
been
good
or
is
still
snappish
he
says
so
at
once
and
is
condoled
with
accordingly
indeed
the
straighteners
have
gone
so
far
as
to
give
names
from
the
hypothetical
language
as
taught
at
the
colleges
of
unreason
to
all
known
forms
of
mental
indisposition
and
to
classify
them
according
to
a
system
of
their
own
which
though
i
could
not
understand
it
seemed
to
work
well
in
practice
for
they
are
always
able
to
tell
a
man
what
is
the
matter
with
him
as
soon
as
they
have
heard
his
story
and
their
familiarity
with
the
long
names
assures
him
that
they
thoroughly
understand
his
case
the
reader
will
have
no
difficulty
in
believing
that
the
laws
regarding
ill
health
were
frequently
evaded
by
the
help
of
recognised
fictions
which
every
one
understood
but
which
it
would
be
considered
gross
breeding
to
even
seem
to
understand
thus
a
day
or
two
after
my
arrival
at
the
nosnibors
one
of
the
many
ladies
who
called
on
me
made
excuses
for
her
husband
only
sending
his
card
on
the
ground
that
when
going
through
the
public
that
morning
he
had
stolen
a
pair
of
socks
i
had
already
been
warned
that
i
should
never
show
surprise
so
i
merely
expressed
my
sympathy
and
said
that
though
i
had
only
been
in
the
capital
so
short
a
time
i
had
already
had
a
very
narrow
escape
from
stealing
a
and
that
though
i
had
resisted
temptation
so
far
i
was
sadly
afraid
that
if
i
saw
any
object
of
special
interest
that
was
neither
too
hot
nor
too
heavy
i
should
have
to
put
myself
in
the
straightener
hands
nosnibor
who
had
been
keeping
an
ear
on
all
that
i
had
been
saying
praised
me
when
the
lady
had
gone
nothing
she
said
could
have
been
more
polite
according
to
erewhonian
etiquette
she
then
explained
that
to
have
stolen
a
pair
of
socks
or
to
have
the
socks
in
more
colloquial
language
was
a
recognised
way
of
saying
that
the
person
in
question
was
slightly
indisposed
in
spite
of
all
this
they
have
a
keen
sense
of
the
enjoyment
consequent
upon
what
they
call
being
well
they
admire
mental
health
and
love
it
in
other
people
and
take
all
the
pains
they
can
consistently
with
their
other
duties
to
secure
it
for
themselves
they
have
an
extreme
dislike
to
marrying
into
what
they
consider
unhealthy
families
they
send
for
the
straightener
at
once
whenever
they
have
been
guilty
of
anything
seriously
flagitious
often
even
if
they
think
that
they
are
on
the
point
of
committing
it
and
though
his
remedies
are
sometimes
exceedingly
painful
involving
close
confinement
for
weeks
and
in
some
cases
the
most
cruel
physical
tortures
i
never
heard
of
a
reasonable
erewhonian
refusing
to
do
what
his
straightener
told
him
any
more
than
of
a
reasonable
englishman
refusing
to
undergo
even
the
most
frightful
operation
if
his
doctors
told
him
it
was
necessary
we
in
england
never
shrink
from
telling
our
doctor
what
is
the
matter
with
us
merely
through
the
fear
that
he
will
hurt
us
we
let
him
do
his
worst
upon
us
and
stand
it
without
a
murmur
because
we
are
not
scouted
for
being
ill
and
because
we
know
that
the
doctor
is
doing
his
best
to
cure
us
and
that
he
can
judge
of
our
case
better
than
we
can
but
we
should
conceal
all
illness
if
we
were
treated
as
the
erewhonians
are
when
they
have
anything
the
matter
with
them
we
should
do
the
same
as
with
moral
and
intellectual
diseases
we
should
feign
health
with
the
most
consummate
art
till
we
were
found
out
and
should
hate
a
single
flogging
given
in
the
way
of
mere
punishment
more
than
the
amputation
of
a
limb
if
it
were
kindly
and
courteously
performed
from
a
wish
to
help
us
out
of
our
difficulty
and
with
the
full
consciousness
on
the
part
of
the
doctor
that
it
was
only
by
an
accident
of
constitution
that
he
was
not
in
the
like
plight
himself
so
the
erewhonians
take
a
flogging
once
a
week
and
a
diet
of
bread
and
water
for
two
or
three
months
together
whenever
their
straightener
recommends
it
i
do
not
suppose
that
even
my
host
on
having
swindled
a
confiding
widow
out
of
the
whole
of
her
property
was
put
to
more
actual
suffering
than
a
man
will
readily
undergo
at
the
hands
of
an
english
doctor
and
yet
he
must
have
had
a
very
bad
time
of
it
the
sounds
i
heard
were
sufficient
to
show
that
his
pain
was
exquisite
but
he
never
shrank
from
undergoing
it
he
was
quite
sure
that
it
did
him
good
and
i
think
he
was
right
i
can
not
believe
that
that
man
will
ever
embezzle
money
again
he
may
but
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
he
does
so
during
my
confinement
in
prison
and
on
my
journey
i
had
already
discovered
a
great
deal
of
the
above
but
it
still
seemed
surpassingly
strange
and
i
was
in
constant
fear
of
committing
some
piece
of
rudeness
through
my
inability
to
look
at
things
from
the
same
as
my
neighbours
but
after
a
few
weeks
stay
with
the
nosnibors
i
got
to
understand
things
better
especially
on
having
heard
all
about
my
illness
of
which
he
told
me
fully
and
repeatedly
it
seemed
that
he
had
been
on
the
stock
exchange
of
the
city
for
many
years
and
had
amassed
enormous
wealth
without
exceeding
the
limits
of
what
was
generally
considered
justifiable
or
at
any
rate
permissible
dealing
but
at
length
on
several
occasions
he
had
become
aware
of
a
desire
to
make
money
by
fraudulent
representations
and
had
actually
dealt
with
two
or
three
sums
in
a
way
which
had
made
him
rather
uncomfortable
he
had
unfortunately
made
light
of
it
and
the
ailment
until
circumstances
eventually
presented
themselves
which
enabled
him
to
cheat
upon
a
very
considerable
scale
he
told
me
what
they
were
and
they
were
about
as
bad
as
anything
could
be
but
i
need
not
detail
them
he
seized
the
opportunity
and
became
aware
when
it
was
too
late
that
he
must
be
seriously
out
of
order
he
had
neglected
himself
too
long
he
drove
home
at
once
broke
the
news
to
his
wife
and
daughters
as
gently
as
he
could
and
sent
off
for
one
of
the
most
celebrated
straighteners
of
the
kingdom
to
a
consultation
with
the
family
practitioner
for
the
case
was
plainly
serious
on
the
arrival
of
the
straightener
he
told
his
story
and
expressed
his
fear
that
his
morals
must
be
permanently
impaired
the
eminent
man
reassured
him
with
a
few
cheering
words
and
then
proceeded
to
make
a
more
careful
diagnosis
of
the
case
he
inquired
concerning
nosnibor
parents
had
their
moral
health
been
good
he
was
answered
that
there
had
not
been
anything
seriously
amiss
with
them
but
that
his
maternal
grandfather
whom
he
was
supposed
to
resemble
somewhat
in
person
had
been
a
consummate
scoundrel
and
had
ended
his
days
in
a
hospital
while
a
brother
of
his
father
after
having
led
a
most
flagitious
life
for
many
years
had
been
at
last
cured
by
a
philosopher
of
a
new
school
which
as
far
as
i
could
understand
it
bore
much
the
same
relation
to
the
old
as
homoeopathy
to
allopathy
the
straightener
shook
his
head
at
this
and
laughingly
replied
that
the
cure
must
have
been
due
to
nature
after
a
few
more
questions
he
wrote
a
prescription
and
departed
i
saw
the
prescription
it
ordered
a
fine
to
the
state
of
double
the
money
embezzled
no
food
but
bread
and
milk
for
six
months
and
a
severe
flogging
once
a
month
for
twelve
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
no
part
of
the
fine
was
to
be
paid
to
the
poor
woman
whose
money
had
been
embezzled
but
on
inquiry
i
learned
that
she
would
have
been
prosecuted
in
the
misplaced
confidence
court
if
she
had
not
escaped
its
clutches
by
dying
shortly
after
she
had
discovered
her
loss
as
for
nosnibor
he
had
received
his
eleventh
flogging
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
i
saw
him
later
on
the
same
afternoon
and
he
was
still
twinged
but
there
had
been
no
escape
from
following
out
the
straightener
prescription
for
the
sanitary
laws
of
erewhon
are
very
rigorous
and
unless
the
straightener
was
satisfied
that
his
orders
had
been
obeyed
the
patient
would
have
been
taken
to
a
hospital
as
the
poor
are
and
would
have
been
much
worse
off
such
at
least
is
the
law
but
it
is
never
necessary
to
enforce
it
on
a
subsequent
occasion
i
was
present
at
an
interview
between
nosnibor
and
the
family
straightener
who
was
considered
competent
to
watch
the
completion
of
the
cure
i
was
struck
with
the
delicacy
with
which
he
avoided
even
the
remotest
semblance
of
inquiry
after
the
physical
of
his
patient
though
there
was
a
certain
yellowness
about
my
host
eyes
which
argued
a
bilious
habit
of
body
to
have
taken
notice
of
this
would
have
been
a
gross
breach
of
professional
etiquette
i
was
told
however
that
a
straightener
sometimes
thinks
it
right
to
glance
at
the
possibility
of
some
slight
physical
disorder
if
he
finds
it
important
in
order
to
assist
him
in
his
diagnosis
but
the
answers
which
he
gets
are
generally
untrue
or
evasive
and
he
forms
his
own
conclusions
upon
the
matter
as
well
as
he
can
sensible
men
have
been
known
to
say
that
the
straightener
should
in
strict
confidence
be
told
of
every
physical
ailment
that
is
likely
to
bear
upon
the
case
but
people
are
naturally
shy
of
doing
this
for
they
do
not
like
lowering
themselves
in
the
opinion
of
the
straightener
and
his
ignorance
of
medical
science
is
supreme
i
heard
of
one
lady
indeed
who
had
the
hardihood
to
confess
that
a
furious
outbreak
of
and
extravagant
fancies
for
which
she
was
seeking
advice
was
possibly
the
result
of
indisposition
you
should
resist
that
said
the
straightener
in
a
kind
but
grave
voice
we
can
do
nothing
for
the
bodies
of
our
patients
such
matters
are
beyond
our
province
and
i
desire
that
i
may
hear
no
further
particulars
the
lady
burst
into
tears
and
promised
faithfully
that
she
would
never
be
unwell
again
but
to
return
to
nosnibor
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
many
carriages
drove
up
with
callers
to
inquire
how
he
had
stood
his
flogging
it
had
been
very
severe
but
the
kind
inquiries
upon
every
side
gave
him
great
pleasure
and
he
assured
me
that
he
felt
almost
tempted
to
do
wrong
again
by
the
solicitude
with
which
his
friends
had
treated
him
during
his
recovery
in
this
i
need
hardly
say
that
he
was
not
serious
during
the
remainder
of
my
stay
in
the
country
nosnibor
was
constantly
attentive
to
his
business
and
largely
increased
his
already
great
possessions
but
i
never
heard
a
whisper
to
the
effect
of
his
having
been
indisposed
a
second
time
or
made
money
by
other
than
the
most
strictly
honourable
means
i
did
hear
afterwards
in
confidence
that
there
had
been
reason
to
believe
that
his
health
had
been
not
a
little
affected
by
the
straightener
treatment
but
his
friends
did
not
choose
to
be
upon
the
subject
and
on
his
return
to
his
affairs
it
was
by
common
consent
passed
over
as
hardly
criminal
in
one
who
was
otherwise
so
much
afflicted
for
they
regard
bodily
ailments
as
the
more
venial
in
proportion
as
they
have
been
produced
by
causes
independent
of
the
constitution
thus
if
a
person
ruin
his
health
by
excessive
indulgence
at
the
table
or
by
drinking
they
count
it
to
be
almost
a
part
of
the
mental
disease
which
brought
it
about
and
so
it
goes
for
little
but
they
have
no
mercy
on
such
illnesses
as
fevers
or
catarrhs
or
lung
diseases
which
to
us
appear
to
be
beyond
the
control
of
the
individual
they
are
only
more
lenient
towards
the
diseases
of
the
young
such
as
measles
which
they
think
to
be
like
sowing
one
wild
oats
and
look
over
them
as
pardonable
indiscretions
if
they
have
not
been
too
serious
and
if
they
are
atoned
for
by
complete
subsequent
recovery
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
the
office
of
straightener
is
one
which
requires
long
and
special
training
it
stands
to
reason
that
he
who
would
cure
a
moral
ailment
must
be
practically
acquainted
with
it
in
all
its
bearings
the
student
for
the
profession
of
straightener
is
required
to
set
apart
certain
seasons
for
the
practice
of
each
vice
in
turn
as
a
religious
duty
these
seasons
are
called
fasts
and
are
continued
by
the
student
until
he
finds
that
he
really
can
subdue
all
the
more
usual
vices
in
his
own
person
and
hence
can
advise
his
patients
from
the
results
of
his
own
experience
those
who
intend
to
be
specialists
rather
than
general
practitioners
devote
themselves
more
particularly
to
the
branch
in
which
their
practice
will
mainly
lie
some
students
have
been
obliged
to
continue
their
exercises
during
their
whole
lives
and
some
devoted
men
have
actually
died
as
martyrs
to
the
drink
or
gluttony
or
whatever
branch
of
vice
they
may
have
chosen
for
their
especial
study
the
greater
number
however
take
no
harm
by
the
excursions
into
the
various
departments
of
vice
which
it
is
incumbent
upon
them
to
study
for
the
erewhonians
hold
that
unalloyed
virtue
is
not
a
thing
to
be
immoderately
indulged
in
i
was
shown
more
than
one
case
in
which
the
real
or
supposed
virtues
of
parents
were
visited
upon
the
children
to
the
third
and
fourth
generation
the
straighteners
say
that
the
most
that
can
be
truly
said
for
virtue
is
that
there
is
a
considerable
balance
in
its
favour
and
that
it
is
on
the
whole
a
good
deal
better
to
be
on
its
side
than
against
it
but
they
urge
that
there
is
much
going
about
which
is
apt
to
let
people
in
very
badly
before
they
find
it
out
those
men
they
say
are
best
who
are
not
remarkable
either
for
vice
or
virtue
i
told
them
about
hogarth
idle
and
industrious
apprentices
but
they
did
not
seem
to
think
that
the
industrious
apprentice
was
a
very
nice
person
chapter
xi
some
erewhonian
trials
in
erewhon
as
in
other
countries
there
are
some
courts
of
justice
that
deal
with
special
subjects
misfortune
generally
as
i
have
above
explained
is
considered
more
or
less
criminal
but
it
admits
of
classification
and
a
court
is
assigned
to
each
of
the
main
heads
under
which
it
can
be
supposed
to
fall
not
very
long
after
i
had
reached
the
capital
i
strolled
into
the
personal
bereavement
court
and
was
much
both
interested
and
pained
by
listening
to
the
trial
of
a
man
who
was
accused
of
having
just
lost
a
wife
to
whom
he
had
been
tenderly
attached
and
who
had
left
him
with
three
little
children
of
whom
the
eldest
was
only
three
years
old
the
defence
which
the
prisoner
counsel
endeavoured
to
establish
was
that
the
prisoner
had
never
really
loved
his
wife
but
it
broke
down
completely
for
the
public
prosecutor
called
witness
after
witness
who
deposed
to
the
fact
that
the
couple
had
been
devoted
to
one
another
and
the
prisoner
repeatedly
wept
as
incidents
were
put
in
evidence
that
reminded
him
of
the
irreparable
nature
of
the
loss
he
had
sustained
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
after
very
little
deliberation
but
recommended
the
prisoner
to
mercy
on
the
ground
that
he
had
but
recently
insured
his
wife
life
for
a
considerable
sum
and
might
be
deemed
lucky
inasmuch
as
he
had
received
the
money
without
demur
from
the
insurance
company
though
he
had
only
paid
two
premiums
i
have
just
said
that
the
jury
found
the
prisoner
guilty
when
the
judge
passed
sentence
i
was
struck
with
the
way
in
which
the
counsel
was
rebuked
for
having
referred
to
a
work
in
which
the
guilt
of
such
misfortunes
as
the
prisoner
was
extenuated
to
a
degree
that
roused
the
indignation
of
the
court
we
shall
have
said
the
judge
these
crude
and
subversionary
books
from
time
to
time
until
it
is
recognised
as
an
axiom
of
morality
that
luck
is
the
only
fit
object
of
human
veneration
how
far
a
man
has
any
right
to
be
more
lucky
and
hence
more
venerable
than
his
neighbours
is
a
point
that
always
has
been
and
always
will
be
settled
proximately
by
a
kind
of
higgling
and
haggling
of
the
market
and
ultimately
by
brute
force
but
however
this
may
be
it
stands
to
reason
that
no
man
should
be
allowed
to
be
unlucky
to
more
than
a
very
moderate
extent
then
turning
to
the
prisoner
the
judge
continued
you
have
suffered
a
great
loss
nature
attaches
a
severe
penalty
to
such
offences
and
human
law
must
emphasise
the
decrees
of
nature
but
for
the
recommendation
of
the
jury
i
should
have
given
you
six
months
hard
labour
i
will
however
commute
your
sentence
to
one
of
three
months
with
the
option
of
a
fine
of
per
cent
of
the
money
you
have
received
from
the
insurance
company
the
prisoner
thanked
the
judge
and
said
that
as
he
had
no
one
to
look
after
his
children
if
he
was
sent
to
prison
he
would
embrace
the
option
mercifully
permitted
him
by
his
lordship
and
pay
the
sum
he
had
named
he
was
then
removed
from
the
dock
the
next
case
was
that
of
a
youth
barely
arrived
at
man
estate
who
was
charged
with
having
been
swindled
out
of
large
property
during
his
minority
by
his
guardian
who
was
also
one
of
his
nearest
relations
his
father
had
been
long
dead
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
his
offence
came
on
for
trial
in
the
personal
bereavement
court
the
lad
who
was
undefended
pleaded
that
he
was
young
inexperienced
greatly
in
awe
of
his
guardian
and
without
independent
professional
advice
young
man
said
the
judge
sternly
do
not
talk
nonsense
people
have
no
right
to
be
young
inexperienced
greatly
in
awe
of
their
guardians
and
without
independent
professional
advice
if
by
such
indiscretions
they
outrage
the
moral
sense
of
their
friends
they
must
expect
to
suffer
accordingly
he
then
ordered
the
prisoner
to
apologise
to
his
guardian
and
to
receive
twelve
strokes
with
a
but
i
shall
perhaps
best
convey
to
the
reader
an
idea
of
the
entire
perversion
of
thought
which
exists
among
this
extraordinary
people
by
describing
the
public
trial
of
a
man
who
was
accused
of
pulmonary
consumption
an
offence
which
was
punished
with
death
until
quite
recently
it
did
not
occur
till
i
had
been
some
months
in
the
country
and
i
am
deviating
from
chronological
order
in
giving
it
here
but
i
had
perhaps
better
do
so
in
order
that
i
may
exhaust
this
subject
before
proceeding
to
others
moreover
i
should
never
come
to
an
end
were
i
to
keep
to
a
strictly
narrative
form
and
detail
the
infinite
absurdities
with
which
i
daily
came
in
contact
the
prisoner
was
placed
in
the
dock
and
the
jury
were
sworn
much
as
in
europe
almost
all
our
own
modes
of
procedure
were
reproduced
even
to
the
requiring
the
prisoner
to
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty
he
pleaded
not
guilty
and
the
case
proceeded
the
evidence
for
the
prosecution
was
very
strong
but
i
must
do
the
court
the
justice
to
observe
that
the
trial
was
absolutely
impartial
counsel
for
the
prisoner
was
allowed
to
urge
everything
that
could
be
said
in
his
defence
the
line
taken
was
that
the
prisoner
was
simulating
consumption
in
order
to
defraud
an
insurance
company
from
which
he
was
about
to
buy
an
annuity
and
that
he
hoped
thus
to
obtain
it
on
more
advantageous
terms
if
this
could
have
been
shown
to
be
the
case
he
would
have
escaped
a
criminal
prosecution
and
been
sent
to
a
hospital
as
for
a
moral
ailment
the
view
however
was
one
which
could
not
be
reasonably
sustained
in
spite
of
all
the
ingenuity
and
eloquence
of
one
of
the
most
celebrated
advocates
of
the
country
the
case
was
only
too
clear
for
the
prisoner
was
almost
at
the
point
of
death
and
it
was
astonishing
that
he
had
not
been
tried
and
convicted
long
previously
his
coughing
was
incessant
during
the
whole
trial
and
it
was
all
that
the
two
jailors
in
charge
of
him
could
do
to
keep
him
on
his
legs
until
it
was
over
the
summing
up
of
the
judge
was
admirable
he
dwelt
upon
every
point
that
could
be
construed
in
favour
of
the
prisoner
but
as
he
proceeded
it
became
clear
that
the
evidence
was
too
convincing
to
admit
of
doubt
and
there
was
but
one
opinion
in
the
court
as
to
the
impending
verdict
when
the
jury
retired
from
the
box
they
were
absent
for
about
ten
minutes
and
on
their
return
the
foreman
pronounced
the
prisoner
guilty
there
was
a
faint
murmur
of
applause
but
it
was
instantly
repressed
the
judge
then
proceeded
to
pronounce
sentence
in
words
which
i
can
never
forget
and
which
i
copied
out
into
a
next
day
from
the
report
that
was
published
in
the
leading
newspaper
i
must
condense
it
somewhat
and
nothing
which
i
could
say
would
give
more
than
a
faint
idea
of
the
solemn
not
to
say
majestic
severity
with
which
it
was
delivered
the
sentence
was
as
follows
prisoner
at
the
bar
you
have
been
accused
of
the
great
crime
of
labouring
under
pulmonary
consumption
and
after
an
impartial
trial
before
a
jury
of
your
countrymen
you
have
been
found
guilty
against
the
justice
of
the
verdict
i
can
say
nothing
the
evidence
against
you
was
conclusive
and
it
only
remains
for
me
to
pass
such
a
sentence
upon
you
as
shall
satisfy
the
ends
of
the
law
that
sentence
must
be
a
very
severe
one
it
pains
me
much
to
see
one
who
is
yet
so
young
and
whose
prospects
in
life
were
otherwise
so
excellent
brought
to
this
distressing
condition
by
a
constitution
which
i
can
only
regard
as
radically
vicious
but
yours
is
no
case
for
compassion
this
is
not
your
first
offence
you
have
led
a
career
of
crime
and
have
only
profited
by
the
leniency
shown
you
upon
past
occasions
to
offend
yet
more
seriously
against
the
laws
and
institutions
of
your
country
you
were
convicted
of
aggravated
bronchitis
last
year
and
i
find
that
though
you
are
now
only
years
old
you
have
been
imprisoned
on
no
less
than
fourteen
occasions
for
illnesses
of
a
more
or
less
hateful
character
in
fact
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
you
have
spent
the
greater
part
of
your
life
in
a
jail
it
is
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
that
you
came
of
unhealthy
parents
and
had
a
severe
accident
in
your
childhood
which
permanently
undermined
your
constitution
excuses
such
as
these
are
the
ordinary
refuge
of
the
criminal
but
they
can
not
for
one
moment
be
listened
to
by
the
ear
of
justice
i
am
not
here
to
enter
upon
curious
metaphysical
questions
as
to
the
origin
of
this
or
that
questions
to
which
there
would
be
no
end
were
their
introduction
once
tolerated
and
which
would
result
in
throwing
the
only
guilt
on
the
tissues
of
the
primordial
cell
or
on
the
elementary
gases
there
is
no
question
of
how
you
came
to
be
wicked
but
only
this
namely
are
you
wicked
or
not
this
has
been
decided
in
the
affirmative
neither
can
i
hesitate
for
a
single
moment
to
say
that
it
has
been
decided
justly
you
are
a
bad
and
dangerous
person
and
stand
branded
in
the
eyes
of
your
with
one
of
the
most
heinous
known
offences
it
is
not
my
business
to
justify
the
law
the
law
may
in
some
cases
have
its
inevitable
hardships
and
i
may
feel
regret
at
times
that
i
have
not
the
option
of
passing
a
less
severe
sentence
than
i
am
compelled
to
do
but
yours
is
no
such
case
on
the
contrary
had
not
the
capital
punishment
for
consumption
been
abolished
i
should
certainly
inflict
it
now
it
is
intolerable
that
an
example
of
such
terrible
enormity
should
be
allowed
to
go
at
large
unpunished
your
presence
in
the
society
of
respectable
people
would
lead
the
less
to
think
more
lightly
of
all
forms
of
illness
neither
can
it
be
permitted
that
you
should
have
the
chance
of
corrupting
unborn
beings
who
might
hereafter
pester
you
the
unborn
must
not
be
allowed
to
come
near
you
and
this
not
so
much
for
their
protection
for
they
are
our
natural
enemies
as
for
our
own
for
since
they
will
not
be
utterly
gainsaid
it
must
be
seen
to
that
they
shall
be
quartered
upon
those
who
are
least
likely
to
corrupt
them
but
independently
of
this
consideration
and
independently
of
the
physical
guilt
which
attaches
itself
to
a
crime
so
great
as
yours
there
is
yet
another
reason
why
we
should
be
unable
to
show
you
mercy
even
if
we
were
inclined
to
do
so
i
refer
to
the
existence
of
a
class
of
men
who
lie
hidden
among
us
and
who
are
called
physicians
were
the
severity
of
the
law
or
the
current
feeling
of
the
country
to
be
relaxed
never
so
slightly
these
abandoned
persons
who
are
now
compelled
to
practise
secretly
and
who
can
be
consulted
only
at
the
greatest
risk
would
become
frequent
visitors
in
every
household
their
organisation
and
their
intimate
acquaintance
with
all
family
secrets
would
give
them
a
power
both
social
and
political
which
nothing
could
resist
the
head
of
the
household
would
become
subordinate
to
the
family
doctor
who
would
interfere
between
man
and
wife
between
master
and
servant
until
the
doctors
should
be
the
only
depositaries
of
power
in
the
nation
and
have
all
that
we
hold
precious
at
their
mercy
a
time
of
universal
dephysicalisation
would
ensue
of
all
kinds
would
abound
in
our
streets
and
advertise
in
all
our
newspapers
there
is
one
remedy
for
this
and
one
only
it
is
that
which
the
laws
of
this
country
have
long
received
and
acted
upon
and
consists
in
the
sternest
repression
of
all
diseases
whatsoever
as
soon
as
their
existence
is
made
manifest
to
the
eye
of
the
law
would
that
that
eye
were
far
more
piercing
than
it
is
but
i
will
enlarge
no
further
upon
things
that
are
themselves
so
obvious
you
may
say
that
it
is
not
your
fault
the
answer
is
ready
enough
at
hand
and
it
amounts
to
this
that
if
you
had
been
born
of
healthy
and
parents
and
been
well
taken
care
of
when
you
were
a
child
you
would
never
have
offended
against
the
laws
of
your
country
nor
found
yourself
in
your
present
disgraceful
position
if
you
tell
me
that
you
had
no
hand
in
your
parentage
and
education
and
that
it
is
therefore
unjust
to
lay
these
things
to
your
charge
i
answer
that
whether
your
being
in
a
consumption
is
your
fault
or
no
it
is
a
fault
in
you
and
it
is
my
duty
to
see
that
against
such
faults
as
this
the
commonwealth
shall
be
protected
you
may
say
that
it
is
your
misfortune
to
be
criminal
i
answer
that
it
is
your
crime
to
be
unfortunate
lastly
i
should
point
out
that
even
though
the
jury
had
acquitted
you
a
supposition
that
i
can
not
seriously
entertain
i
should
have
felt
it
my
duty
to
inflict
a
sentence
hardly
less
severe
than
that
which
i
must
pass
at
present
for
the
more
you
had
been
found
guiltless
of
the
crime
imputed
to
you
the
more
you
would
have
been
found
guilty
of
one
hardly
less
heinous
i
mean
the
crime
of
having
been
maligned
unjustly
i
do
not
hesitate
therefore
to
sentence
you
to
imprisonment
with
hard
labour
for
the
rest
of
your
miserable
existence
during
that
period
i
would
earnestly
entreat
you
to
repent
of
the
wrongs
you
have
done
already
and
to
entirely
reform
the
constitution
of
your
whole
body
i
entertain
but
little
hope
that
you
will
pay
attention
to
my
advice
you
are
already
far
too
abandoned
did
it
rest
with
myself
i
should
add
nothing
in
mitigation
of
the
sentence
which
i
have
passed
but
it
is
the
merciful
provision
of
the
law
that
even
the
most
hardened
criminal
shall
be
allowed
some
one
of
the
three
official
remedies
which
is
to
be
prescribed
at
the
time
of
his
conviction
i
shall
therefore
order
that
you
receive
two
tablespoonfuls
of
castor
oil
daily
until
the
pleasure
of
the
court
be
further
known
when
the
sentence
was
concluded
the
prisoner
acknowledged
in
a
few
scarcely
audible
words
that
he
was
justly
punished
and
that
he
had
had
a
fair
trial
he
was
then
removed
to
the
prison
from
which
he
was
never
to
return
there
was
a
second
attempt
at
applause
when
the
judge
had
finished
speaking
but
as
before
it
was
at
once
repressed
and
though
the
feeling
of
the
court
was
strongly
against
the
prisoner
there
was
no
show
of
any
violence
against
him
if
one
may
except
a
little
hooting
from
the
bystanders
when
he
was
being
removed
in
the
prisoners
van
indeed
nothing
struck
me
more
during
my
whole
sojourn
in
the
country
than
the
general
respect
for
law
and
order
chapter
xii
malcontents
i
confess
that
i
felt
rather
unhappy
when
i
got
home
and
thought
more
closely
over
the
trial
that
i
had
just
witnessed
for
the
time
i
was
carried
away
by
the
opinion
of
those
among
whom
i
was
they
had
no
misgivings
about
what
they
were
doing
there
did
not
seem
to
be
a
person
in
the
whole
court
who
had
the
smallest
doubt
but
that
all
was
exactly
as
it
should
be
this
universal
unsuspecting
confidence
was
imparted
by
sympathy
to
myself
in
spite
of
all
my
training
in
opinions
so
widely
different
so
it
is
with
most
of
us
that
which
we
observe
to
be
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
by
those
around
us
we
take
as
a
matter
of
course
ourselves
and
after
all
it
is
our
duty
to
do
this
save
upon
grave
occasion
but
when
i
was
alone
and
began
to
think
the
trial
over
it
certainly
did
strike
me
as
betraying
a
strange
and
untenable
position
had
the
judge
said
that
he
acknowledged
the
probable
truth
namely
that
the
prisoner
was
born
of
unhealthy
parents
or
had
been
starved
in
infancy
or
had
met
with
some
accidents
which
had
developed
consumption
and
had
he
then
gone
on
to
say
that
though
he
knew
all
this
and
bitterly
regretted
that
the
protection
of
society
obliged
him
to
inflict
additional
pain
on
one
who
had
suffered
so
much
already
yet
that
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
could
have
understood
the
position
however
mistaken
i
might
have
thought
it
the
judge
was
fully
persuaded
that
the
infliction
of
pain
upon
the
weak
and
sickly
was
the
only
means
of
preventing
weakness
and
sickliness
from
spreading
and
that
ten
times
the
suffering
now
inflicted
upon
the
accused
was
eventually
warded
off
from
others
by
the
present
apparent
severity
i
could
therefore
perfectly
understand
his
inflicting
whatever
pain
he
might
consider
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
so
bad
an
example
from
spreading
further
and
lowering
the
erewhonian
standard
but
it
seemed
almost
childish
to
tell
the
prisoner
that
he
could
have
been
in
good
health
if
he
had
been
more
fortunate
in
his
constitution
and
been
exposed
to
less
hardships
when
he
was
a
boy
i
write
with
great
diffidence
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
unfairness
in
punishing
people
for
their
misfortunes
or
rewarding
them
for
their
sheer
good
luck
it
is
the
normal
condition
of
human
life
that
this
should
be
done
and
no
person
will
complain
of
being
subjected
to
the
common
treatment
there
is
no
alternative
open
to
us
it
is
idle
to
say
that
men
are
not
responsible
for
their
misfortunes
what
is
responsibility
surely
to
be
responsible
means
to
be
liable
to
have
to
give
an
answer
should
it
be
demanded
and
all
things
which
live
are
responsible
for
their
lives
and
actions
should
society
see
fit
to
question
them
through
the
mouth
of
its
authorised
agent
what
is
the
offence
of
a
lamb
that
we
should
rear
it
and
tend
it
and
lull
it
into
security
for
the
express
purpose
of
killing
it
its
offence
is
the
misfortune
of
being
something
which
society
wants
to
eat
and
which
can
not
defend
itself
this
is
ample
who
shall
limit
the
right
of
society
except
society
itself
and
what
consideration
for
the
individual
is
tolerable
unless
society
be
the
gainer
thereby
wherefore
should
a
man
be
so
richly
rewarded
for
having
been
son
to
a
millionaire
were
it
not
clearly
provable
that
the
common
welfare
is
thus
better
furthered
we
can
not
seriously
detract
from
a
man
merit
in
having
been
the
son
of
a
rich
father
without
imperilling
our
own
tenure
of
things
which
we
do
not
wish
to
jeopardise
if
this
were
otherwise
we
should
not
let
him
keep
his
money
for
a
single
hour
we
would
have
it
ourselves
at
once
for
property
is
robbery
but
then
we
are
all
robbers
or
robbers
together
and
have
found
it
essential
to
organise
our
thieving
as
we
have
found
it
necessary
to
organise
our
lust
and
our
revenge
property
marriage
the
law
as
the
bed
to
the
river
so
rule
and
convention
to
the
instinct
and
woe
to
him
who
tampers
with
the
banks
while
the
flood
is
flowing
but
to
return
even
in
england
a
man
on
board
a
ship
with
yellow
fever
is
held
responsible
for
his
mischance
no
matter
what
his
being
kept
in
quarantine
may
cost
him
he
may
catch
the
fever
and
die
we
can
not
help
it
he
must
take
his
chance
as
other
people
do
but
surely
it
would
be
desperate
unkindness
to
add
contumely
to
our
unless
indeed
we
believe
that
contumely
is
one
of
our
best
means
of
again
take
the
case
of
maniacs
we
say
that
they
are
irresponsible
for
their
actions
but
we
take
good
care
or
ought
to
take
good
care
that
they
shall
answer
to
us
for
their
insanity
and
we
imprison
them
in
what
we
call
an
asylum
that
modern
sanctuary
if
we
do
not
like
their
answers
this
is
a
strange
kind
of
irresponsibility
what
we
ought
to
say
is
that
we
can
afford
to
be
satisfied
with
a
less
satisfactory
answer
from
a
lunatic
than
from
one
who
is
not
mad
because
lunacy
is
less
infectious
than
crime
we
kill
a
serpent
if
we
go
in
danger
by
it
simply
for
being
such
and
such
a
serpent
in
such
and
such
a
place
but
we
never
say
that
the
serpent
has
only
itself
to
blame
for
not
having
been
a
harmless
creature
its
crime
is
that
of
being
the
thing
which
it
is
but
this
is
a
capital
offence
and
we
are
right
in
killing
it
out
of
the
way
unless
we
think
it
more
danger
to
do
so
than
to
let
it
escape
nevertheless
we
pity
the
creature
even
though
we
kill
it
but
in
the
case
of
him
whose
trial
i
have
described
above
it
was
impossible
that
any
one
in
the
court
should
not
have
known
that
it
was
but
by
an
accident
of
birth
and
circumstances
that
he
was
not
himself
also
in
a
consumption
and
yet
none
thought
that
it
disgraced
them
to
hear
the
judge
give
vent
to
the
most
cruel
truisms
about
him
the
judge
himself
was
a
kind
and
thoughtful
person
he
was
a
man
of
magnificent
and
benign
presence
he
was
evidently
of
an
iron
constitution
and
his
face
wore
an
expression
of
the
maturest
wisdom
and
experience
yet
for
all
this
old
and
learned
as
he
was
he
could
not
see
things
which
one
would
have
thought
would
have
been
apparent
even
to
a
child
he
could
not
emancipate
himself
from
nay
it
did
not
even
occur
to
him
to
feel
the
bondage
of
the
ideas
in
which
he
had
been
born
and
bred
so
was
it
also
with
the
jury
and
bystanders
and
most
wonderful
of
all
so
was
it
even
with
the
prisoner
throughout
he
seemed
fully
impressed
with
the
notion
that
he
was
being
dealt
with
justly
he
saw
nothing
wanton
in
his
being
told
by
the
judge
that
he
was
to
be
punished
not
so
much
as
a
necessary
protection
to
society
although
this
was
not
entirely
lost
sight
of
as
because
he
had
not
been
better
born
and
bred
than
he
was
but
this
led
me
to
hope
that
he
suffered
less
than
he
would
have
done
if
he
had
seen
the
matter
in
the
same
light
that
i
did
and
after
all
justice
is
relative
i
may
here
mention
that
only
a
few
years
before
my
arrival
in
the
country
the
treatment
of
all
convicted
invalids
had
been
much
more
barbarous
than
now
for
no
physical
remedy
was
provided
and
prisoners
were
put
to
the
severest
labour
in
all
sorts
of
weather
so
that
most
of
them
soon
succumbed
to
the
extreme
hardships
which
they
suffered
this
was
supposed
to
be
beneficial
in
some
ways
inasmuch
as
it
put
the
country
to
less
expense
for
the
maintenance
of
its
criminal
class
but
the
growth
of
luxury
had
induced
a
relaxation
of
the
old
severity
and
a
sensitive
age
would
no
longer
tolerate
what
appeared
to
be
an
excess
of
rigour
even
towards
the
most
guilty
moreover
it
was
found
that
juries
were
less
willing
to
convict
and
justice
was
often
cheated
because
there
was
no
alternative
between
virtually
condemning
a
man
to
death
and
letting
him
go
free
it
was
also
held
that
the
country
paid
in
recommittals
for
its
for
those
who
had
been
imprisoned
even
for
trifling
ailments
were
often
permanently
disabled
by
their
imprisonment
and
when
a
man
had
been
once
convicted
it
was
probable
that
he
would
seldom
afterwards
be
off
the
hands
of
the
country
these
evils
had
long
been
apparent
and
recognised
yet
people
were
too
indolent
and
too
indifferent
to
suffering
not
their
own
to
bestir
themselves
about
putting
an
end
to
them
until
at
last
a
benevolent
reformer
devoted
his
whole
life
to
effecting
the
necessary
changes
he
divided
all
illnesses
into
three
classes
those
affecting
the
head
the
trunk
and
the
lower
limbs
and
obtained
an
enactment
that
all
diseases
of
the
head
whether
internal
or
external
should
be
treated
with
laudanum
those
of
the
body
with
and
those
of
the
lower
limbs
with
an
embrocation
of
strong
sulphuric
acid
and
water
it
may
be
said
that
the
classification
was
not
sufficiently
careful
and
that
the
remedies
were
ill
chosen
but
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
initiate
any
reform
and
it
was
necessary
to
familiarise
the
public
mind
with
the
principle
by
inserting
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
first
it
is
not
therefore
to
be
wondered
at
that
among
so
practical
a
people
there
should
still
be
some
room
for
improvement
the
mass
of
the
nation
are
well
pleased
with
existing
arrangements
and
believe
that
their
treatment
of
criminals
leaves
little
or
nothing
to
be
desired
but
there
is
an
energetic
minority
who
hold
what
are
considered
to
be
extreme
opinions
and
who
are
not
at
all
disposed
to
rest
contented
until
the
principle
lately
admitted
has
been
carried
further
i
was
at
some
pains
to
discover
the
opinions
of
these
men
and
their
reasons
for
entertaining
them
they
are
held
in
great
odium
by
the
generality
of
the
public
and
are
considered
as
subverters
of
all
morality
whatever
the
malcontents
on
the
other
hand
assert
that
illness
is
the
inevitable
result
of
certain
antecedent
causes
which
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
were
beyond
the
control
of
the
individual
and
that
therefore
a
man
is
only
guilty
for
being
in
a
consumption
in
the
same
way
as
rotten
fruit
is
guilty
for
having
gone
rotten
true
the
fruit
must
be
thrown
on
one
side
as
unfit
for
man
use
and
the
man
in
a
consumption
must
be
put
in
prison
for
the
protection
of
his
but
these
radicals
would
not
punish
him
further
than
by
loss
of
liberty
and
a
strict
surveillance
so
long
as
he
was
prevented
from
injuring
society
they
would
allow
him
to
make
himself
useful
by
supplying
whatever
of
society
wants
he
could
supply
if
he
succeeded
in
thus
earning
money
they
would
have
him
made
as
comfortable
in
prison
as
possible
and
would
in
no
way
interfere
with
his
liberty
more
than
was
necessary
to
prevent
him
from
escaping
or
from
becoming
more
severely
indisposed
within
the
prison
walls
but
they
would
deduct
from
his
earnings
the
expenses
of
his
board
lodging
surveillance
and
half
those
of
his
conviction
if
he
was
too
ill
to
do
anything
for
his
support
in
prison
they
would
allow
him
nothing
but
bread
and
water
and
very
little
of
that
they
say
that
society
is
foolish
in
refusing
to
allow
itself
to
be
benefited
by
a
man
merely
because
he
has
done
it
harm
hitherto
and
that
objection
to
the
labour
of
the
diseased
classes
is
only
protection
in
another
form
it
is
an
attempt
to
raise
the
natural
price
of
a
commodity
by
saying
that
such
and
such
persons
who
are
able
and
willing
to
produce
it
shall
not
do
so
whereby
every
one
has
to
pay
more
for
it
besides
so
long
as
a
man
has
not
been
actually
killed
he
is
our
creature
though
perhaps
a
very
unpleasant
one
it
is
in
a
great
degree
the
doing
of
others
that
he
is
what
he
is
or
in
other
words
the
society
which
now
condemns
him
is
partly
answerable
concerning
him
they
say
that
there
is
no
fear
of
any
increase
of
disease
under
these
circumstances
for
the
loss
of
liberty
the
surveillance
the
considerable
and
compulsory
deduction
from
the
prisoner
earnings
the
very
sparing
use
of
stimulants
of
which
they
would
allow
but
little
to
any
and
none
to
those
who
did
not
earn
them
the
enforced
celibacy
and
above
all
the
loss
of
reputation
among
friends
are
in
their
opinion
as
ample
safeguards
to
society
against
a
general
neglect
of
health
as
those
now
resorted
to
a
man
therefore
so
they
say
should
carry
his
profession
or
trade
into
prison
with
him
if
possible
if
not
he
must
earn
his
living
by
the
nearest
thing
to
it
that
he
can
but
if
he
be
a
gentleman
born
and
bred
to
no
profession
he
must
pick
oakum
or
write
art
criticisms
for
a
newspaper
these
people
say
further
that
the
greater
part
of
the
illness
which
exists
in
their
country
is
brought
about
by
the
insane
manner
in
which
it
is
treated
they
believe
that
illness
is
in
many
cases
just
as
curable
as
the
moral
diseases
which
they
see
daily
cured
around
them
but
that
a
great
reform
is
impossible
till
men
learn
to
take
a
juster
view
of
what
physical
obliquity
proceeds
from
men
will
hide
their
illnesses
as
long
as
they
are
scouted
on
its
becoming
known
that
they
are
ill
it
is
the
scouting
not
the
physic
which
produces
the
concealment
and
if
a
man
felt
that
the
news
of
his
being
in
would
be
received
by
his
neighbours
as
a
deplorable
fact
but
one
as
much
the
result
of
necessary
antecedent
causes
as
though
he
had
broken
into
a
jeweller
shop
and
stolen
a
valuable
diamond
necklace
as
a
fact
which
might
just
as
easily
have
happened
to
themselves
only
that
they
had
the
luck
to
be
better
born
or
reared
and
if
they
also
felt
that
they
would
not
be
made
more
uncomfortable
in
the
prison
than
the
protection
of
society
against
infection
and
the
proper
treatment
of
their
own
disease
actually
demanded
men
would
give
themselves
up
to
the
police
as
readily
on
perceiving
that
they
had
taken
as
they
go
now
to
the
straightener
when
they
feel
that
they
are
on
the
point
of
forging
a
will
or
running
away
with
somebody
else
wife
but
the
main
argument
on
which
they
rely
is
that
of
economy
for
they
know
that
they
will
sooner
gain
their
end
by
appealing
to
men
pockets
in
which
they
have
generally
something
of
their
own
than
to
their
heads
which
contain
for
the
most
part
little
but
borrowed
or
stolen
property
and
also
they
believe
it
to
be
the
readiest
test
and
the
one
which
has
most
to
show
for
itself
if
a
course
of
conduct
can
be
shown
to
cost
a
country
less
and
this
by
no
dishonourable
saving
and
with
no
indirectly
increased
expenditure
in
other
ways
they
hold
that
it
requires
a
good
deal
to
upset
the
arguments
in
favour
of
its
being
adopted
and
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
they
think
that
the
more
medicinal
and
humane
treatment
of
the
diseased
of
which
they
are
the
advocates
would
in
the
long
run
be
much
cheaper
to
the
country
but
i
did
not
gather
that
these
reformers
were
opposed
to
meeting
some
of
the
more
violent
forms
of
illness
with
the
or
with
death
for
they
saw
no
so
effectual
way
of
checking
them
they
would
therefore
both
flog
and
hang
but
they
would
do
so
pitifully
i
have
perhaps
dwelt
too
long
upon
opinions
which
can
have
no
possible
bearing
upon
our
own
but
i
have
not
said
the
tenth
part
of
what
these
reformers
urged
upon
me
i
feel
however
that
i
have
sufficiently
trespassed
upon
the
attention
of
the
reader
chapter
xiii
the
views
of
the
erewhonians
concerning
death
the
erewhonians
regard
death
with
less
abhorrence
than
disease
if
it
is
an
offence
at
all
it
is
one
beyond
the
reach
of
the
law
which
is
therefore
silent
on
the
subject
but
they
insist
that
the
greater
number
of
those
who
are
commonly
said
to
die
have
never
yet
been
born
not
at
least
into
that
unseen
world
which
is
alone
worthy
of
consideration
as
regards
this
unseen
world
i
understand
them
to
say
that
some
miscarry
in
respect
to
it
before
they
have
even
reached
the
seen
and
some
after
while
few
are
ever
truly
born
into
it
at
all
the
greater
part
of
all
the
men
and
women
over
the
whole
country
miscarrying
before
they
reach
it
and
they
say
that
this
does
not
matter
so
much
as
we
think
it
does
as
for
what
we
call
death
they
argue
that
too
much
has
been
made
of
it
the
mere
knowledge
that
we
shall
one
day
die
does
not
make
us
very
unhappy
no
one
thinks
that
he
or
she
will
escape
so
that
none
are
disappointed
we
do
not
care
greatly
even
though
we
know
that
we
have
not
long
to
live
the
only
thing
that
would
seriously
affect
us
would
be
the
knowing
or
rather
thinking
that
we
know
the
precise
moment
at
which
the
blow
will
fall
happily
no
one
can
ever
certainly
know
this
though
many
try
to
make
themselves
miserable
by
endeavouring
to
find
it
out
it
seems
as
though
there
were
some
power
somewhere
which
mercifully
stays
us
from
putting
that
sting
into
the
tail
of
death
which
we
would
put
there
if
we
could
and
which
ensures
that
though
death
must
always
be
a
bugbear
it
shall
never
under
any
conceivable
circumstances
be
more
than
a
bugbear
for
even
though
a
man
is
condemned
to
die
in
a
week
time
and
is
shut
up
in
a
prison
from
which
it
is
certain
that
he
can
not
escape
he
will
always
hope
that
a
reprieve
may
come
before
the
week
is
over
besides
the
prison
may
catch
fire
and
he
may
be
suffocated
not
with
a
rope
but
with
common
ordinary
smoke
or
he
may
be
struck
dead
by
lightning
while
exercising
in
the
prison
yards
when
the
morning
is
come
on
which
the
poor
wretch
is
to
be
hanged
he
may
choke
at
his
breakfast
or
die
from
failure
of
the
heart
action
before
the
drop
has
fallen
and
even
though
it
has
fallen
he
can
not
be
quite
certain
that
he
is
going
to
die
for
he
can
not
know
this
till
his
death
has
actually
taken
place
and
it
will
be
too
late
then
for
him
to
discover
that
he
was
going
to
die
at
the
appointed
hour
after
all
the
erewhonians
therefore
hold
that
death
like
life
is
an
affair
of
being
more
frightened
than
hurt
they
burn
their
dead
and
the
ashes
are
presently
scattered
over
any
piece
of
ground
which
the
deceased
may
himself
have
chosen
no
one
is
permitted
to
refuse
this
hospitality
to
the
dead
people
therefore
generally
choose
some
garden
or
orchard
which
they
may
have
known
and
been
fond
of
when
they
were
young
the
superstitious
hold
that
those
whose
ashes
are
scattered
over
any
land
become
its
jealous
guardians
from
that
time
forward
and
the
living
like
to
think
that
they
shall
become
identified
with
this
or
that
locality
where
they
have
once
been
happy
they
do
not
put
up
monuments
nor
write
epitaphs
for
their
dead
though
in
former
ages
their
practice
was
much
as
ours
but
they
have
a
custom
which
comes
to
much
the
same
thing
for
the
instinct
of
preserving
the
name
alive
after
the
death
of
the
body
seems
to
be
common
to
all
mankind
they
have
statues
of
themselves
made
while
they
are
still
alive
those
that
is
who
can
afford
it
and
write
inscriptions
under
them
which
are
often
quite
as
untruthful
as
are
our
own
epitaphs
only
in
another
way
for
they
do
not
hesitate
to
describe
themselves
as
victims
to
ill
temper
jealousy
covetousness
and
the
like
but
almost
always
lay
claim
to
personal
beauty
whether
they
have
it
or
not
and
often
to
the
possession
of
a
large
sum
in
the
funded
debt
of
the
country
if
a
person
is
ugly
he
does
not
sit
as
a
model
for
his
own
statue
although
it
bears
his
name
he
gets
the
handsomest
of
his
friends
to
sit
for
him
and
one
of
the
ways
of
paying
a
compliment
to
another
is
to
ask
him
to
sit
for
such
a
statue
women
generally
sit
for
their
own
statues
from
a
natural
disinclination
to
admit
the
superior
beauty
of
a
friend
but
they
expect
to
be
idealised
i
understood
that
the
multitude
of
these
statues
was
beginning
to
be
felt
as
an
encumbrance
in
almost
every
family
and
that
the
custom
would
probably
before
long
fall
into
desuetude
indeed
this
has
already
come
about
to
the
satisfaction
of
every
one
as
regards
the
statues
of
public
men
not
more
than
three
of
which
can
be
found
in
the
whole
capital
i
expressed
my
surprise
at
this
and
was
told
that
some
five
hundred
years
before
my
visit
the
city
had
been
so
overrun
with
these
pests
that
there
was
no
getting
about
and
people
were
worried
beyond
endurance
by
having
their
attention
called
at
every
touch
and
turn
to
something
which
when
they
had
attended
to
it
they
found
not
to
concern
them
most
of
these
statues
were
mere
attempts
to
do
for
some
man
or
woman
what
an
does
more
successfully
for
a
dog
or
bird
or
pike
they
were
generally
foisted
on
the
public
by
some
coterie
that
was
trying
to
exalt
itself
in
exalting
some
one
else
and
not
unfrequently
they
had
no
other
inception
than
desire
on
the
part
of
some
member
of
the
coterie
to
find
a
job
for
a
young
sculptor
to
whom
his
daughter
was
engaged
statues
so
begotten
could
never
be
anything
but
deformities
and
this
is
the
way
in
which
they
are
sure
to
be
begotten
as
soon
as
the
art
of
making
them
at
all
has
become
widely
practised
i
know
not
why
but
all
the
noblest
arts
hold
in
perfection
but
for
a
very
little
moment
they
soon
reach
a
height
from
which
they
begin
to
decline
and
when
they
have
begun
to
decline
it
is
a
pity
that
they
can
not
be
knocked
on
the
head
for
an
art
is
like
a
living
organism
better
dead
than
dying
there
is
no
way
of
making
an
aged
art
young
again
it
must
be
born
anew
and
grow
up
from
infancy
as
a
new
thing
working
out
its
own
salvation
from
effort
to
effort
in
all
fear
and
trembling
the
erewhonians
five
hundred
years
ago
understood
nothing
of
all
this
i
doubt
whether
they
even
do
so
now
they
wanted
to
get
the
nearest
thing
they
could
to
a
stuffed
man
whose
stuffing
should
not
grow
mouldy
they
should
have
had
some
such
an
establishment
as
our
madame
tussaud
where
the
figures
wear
real
clothes
and
are
painted
up
to
nature
such
an
institution
might
have
been
made
for
people
might
have
been
made
to
pay
before
going
in
as
it
was
they
had
let
their
poor
cold
grimy
colourless
heroes
and
heroines
loaf
about
in
squares
and
in
corners
of
streets
in
all
weathers
without
any
attempt
at
artistic
sanitation
for
there
was
no
provision
for
burying
their
dead
works
of
art
out
of
their
sight
no
drainage
so
to
speak
whereby
statues
that
had
been
sufficiently
assimilated
so
as
to
form
part
of
the
residuary
impression
of
the
country
might
be
carried
away
out
of
the
system
hence
they
put
them
up
with
a
light
heart
on
the
cackling
of
their
coteries
and
they
and
their
children
had
to
live
often
enough
with
some
wordy
windbag
whose
cowardice
had
cost
the
country
untold
loss
in
blood
and
money
at
last
the
evil
reached
such
a
pitch
that
the
people
rose
and
with
indiscriminate
fury
destroyed
good
and
bad
alike
most
of
what
was
destroyed
was
bad
but
some
few
works
were
good
and
the
sculptors
of
day
wring
their
hands
over
some
of
the
fragments
that
have
been
preserved
in
museums
up
and
down
the
country
for
a
couple
of
hundred
years
or
so
not
a
statue
was
made
from
one
end
of
the
kingdom
to
the
other
but
the
instinct
for
having
stuffed
men
and
women
was
so
strong
that
people
at
length
again
began
to
try
to
make
them
not
knowing
how
to
make
them
and
having
no
academics
to
mislead
them
the
earliest
sculptors
of
this
period
thought
things
out
for
themselves
and
again
produced
works
that
were
full
of
interest
so
that
in
three
or
four
generations
they
reached
a
perfection
hardly
if
at
all
inferior
to
that
of
several
hundred
years
earlier
on
this
the
same
evils
recurred
sculptors
obtained
high
prices
the
art
became
a
trade
schools
arose
which
professed
to
sell
the
holy
spirit
of
art
for
money
pupils
flocked
from
far
and
near
to
buy
it
in
the
hopes
of
selling
it
later
on
and
were
struck
purblind
as
a
punishment
for
the
sin
of
those
who
sent
them
before
long
a
second
iconoclastic
fury
would
infallibly
have
followed
but
for
the
prescience
of
a
statesman
who
succeeded
in
passing
an
act
to
the
effect
that
no
statue
of
any
public
man
or
woman
should
be
allowed
to
remain
unbroken
for
more
than
fifty
years
unless
at
the
end
of
that
time
a
jury
of
men
taken
at
random
from
the
street
pronounced
in
favour
of
its
being
allowed
a
second
fifty
years
of
life
every
fifty
years
this
reconsideration
was
to
be
repeated
and
unless
there
was
a
majority
of
eighteen
in
favour
of
the
retention
of
the
statue
it
was
to
be
destroyed
perhaps
a
simpler
plan
would
have
been
to
forbid
the
erection
of
a
statue
to
any
public
man
or
woman
till
he
or
she
had
been
dead
at
least
one
hundred
years
and
even
then
to
insist
on
reconsideration
of
the
claims
of
the
deceased
and
the
merit
of
the
statue
every
fifty
years
but
the
working
of
the
act
brought
about
results
that
on
the
whole
were
satisfactory
for
in
the
first
place
many
public
statues
that
would
have
been
voted
under
the
old
system
were
not
ordered
when
it
was
known
that
they
would
be
almost
certainly
broken
up
after
fifty
years
and
in
the
second
public
sculptors
knowing
their
work
to
be
so
ephemeral
scamped
it
to
an
extent
that
made
it
offensive
even
to
the
most
uncultured
eye
hence
before
long
subscribers
took
to
paying
the
sculptor
for
the
statue
of
their
dead
statesmen
on
condition
that
he
did
not
make
it
the
tribute
of
respect
was
thus
paid
to
the
deceased
the
public
sculptors
were
not
mulcted
and
the
rest
of
the
public
suffered
no
inconvenience
i
was
told
however
that
an
abuse
of
this
custom
is
growing
up
inasmuch
as
the
competition
for
the
commission
not
to
make
a
statue
is
so
keen
that
sculptors
have
been
known
to
return
a
considerable
part
of
the
purchase
money
to
the
subscribers
by
an
arrangement
made
with
them
beforehand
such
transactions
however
are
always
clandestine
a
small
inscription
is
let
into
the
pavement
where
the
public
statue
would
have
stood
which
informs
the
reader
that
such
a
statue
has
been
ordered
for
the
person
whoever
he
or
she
may
be
but
that
as
yet
the
sculptor
has
not
been
able
to
complete
it
there
has
been
no
act
to
repress
statues
that
are
intended
for
private
consumption
but
as
i
have
said
the
custom
is
falling
into
desuetude
returning
to
erewhonian
customs
in
connection
with
death
there
is
one
which
i
can
hardly
pass
over
when
any
one
dies
the
friends
of
the
family
write
no
letters
of
condolence
neither
do
they
attend
the
scattering
nor
wear
mourning
but
they
send
little
boxes
filled
with
artificial
tears
and
with
the
name
of
the
sender
painted
neatly
upon
the
outside
of
the
lid
the
tears
vary
in
number
from
two
to
fifteen
or
sixteen
according
to
degree
of
intimacy
or
relationship
and
people
sometimes
find
it
a
nice
point
of
etiquette
to
know
the
exact
number
which
they
ought
to
send
strange
as
it
may
appear
this
attention
is
highly
valued
and
its
omission
by
those
from
whom
it
might
be
expected
is
keenly
felt
these
tears
were
formerly
stuck
with
adhesive
plaster
to
the
cheeks
of
the
bereaved
and
were
worn
in
public
for
a
few
months
after
the
death
of
a
relative
they
were
then
banished
to
the
hat
or
bonnet
and
are
now
no
longer
worn
the
birth
of
a
child
is
looked
upon
as
a
painful
subject
on
which
it
is
kinder
not
to
touch
the
illness
of
the
mother
is
carefully
concealed
until
the
necessity
for
signing
the
of
which
hereafter
renders
further
secrecy
impossible
and
for
some
months
before
the
event
the
family
live
in
retirement
seeing
very
little
company
when
the
offence
is
over
and
done
with
it
is
condoned
by
the
common
want
of
logic
for
this
merciful
provision
of
nature
this
buffer
against
collisions
this
friction
which
upsets
our
calculations
but
without
which
existence
would
be
intolerable
this
crowning
glory
of
human
invention
whereby
we
can
be
blind
and
see
at
one
and
the
same
moment
this
blessed
inconsistency
exists
here
as
elsewhere
and
though
the
strictest
writers
on
morality
have
maintained
that
it
is
wicked
for
a
woman
to
have
children
at
all
inasmuch
as
it
is
wrong
to
be
out
of
health
that
good
may
come
yet
the
necessity
of
the
case
has
caused
a
general
feeling
in
favour
of
passing
over
such
events
in
silence
and
of
assuming
their
existence
except
in
such
flagrant
cases
as
force
themselves
on
the
public
notice
against
these
the
condemnation
of
society
is
inexorable
and
if
it
is
believed
that
the
illness
has
been
dangerous
and
protracted
it
is
almost
impossible
for
a
woman
to
recover
her
former
position
in
society
the
above
conventions
struck
me
as
arbitrary
and
cruel
but
they
put
a
stop
to
many
fancied
ailments
for
the
situation
so
far
from
being
considered
interesting
is
looked
upon
as
savouring
more
or
less
distinctly
of
a
very
reprehensible
condition
of
things
and
the
ladies
take
care
to
conceal
it
as
long
as
they
can
even
from
their
own
husbands
in
anticipation
of
a
severe
scolding
as
soon
as
the
misdemeanour
is
discovered
also
the
baby
is
kept
out
of
sight
except
on
the
day
of
signing
the
until
it
can
walk
and
talk
should
the
child
unhappily
die
a
coroner
inquest
is
inevitable
but
in
order
to
avoid
disgracing
a
family
which
may
have
been
hitherto
respected
it
is
almost
invariably
found
that
the
child
was
over
years
old
and
died
from
the
decay
of
nature
chapter
xiv
mahaina
i
continued
my
sojourn
with
the
nosnibors
in
a
few
days
nosnibor
had
recovered
from
his
flogging
and
was
looking
forward
with
glee
to
the
fact
that
the
next
would
be
the
last
i
did
not
think
that
there
seemed
any
occasion
even
for
this
but
he
said
it
was
better
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
he
would
make
up
the
dozen
he
now
went
to
his
business
as
usual
and
i
understood
that
he
was
never
more
prosperous
in
spite
of
his
heavy
fine
he
was
unable
to
give
me
much
of
his
time
during
the
day
for
he
was
one
of
those
valuable
men
who
are
paid
not
by
the
year
month
week
or
day
but
by
the
minute
his
wife
and
daughters
however
made
much
of
me
and
introduced
me
to
their
friends
who
came
in
shoals
to
call
upon
me
one
of
these
persons
was
a
lady
called
mahaina
zulora
the
elder
of
my
host
daughters
ran
up
to
her
and
embraced
her
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
at
the
same
time
inquiring
tenderly
after
her
poor
dipsomania
mahaina
answered
that
it
was
just
as
bad
as
ever
she
was
a
perfect
martyr
to
it
and
her
excellent
health
was
the
only
thing
which
consoled
her
under
her
affliction
then
the
other
ladies
joined
in
with
condolences
and
the
suggestions
which
they
had
ready
for
every
mental
malady
they
recommended
their
own
straightener
and
disparaged
mahaina
nosnibor
had
a
favourite
nostrum
but
i
could
catch
little
of
its
nature
i
heard
the
words
full
confidence
that
the
desire
to
drink
will
cease
when
the
formula
has
been
repeated
this
confidence
is
far
from
undervaluing
a
thorough
determination
never
to
touch
spirits
again
fail
too
often
formula
a
with
great
emphasis
prescribed
form
full
conviction
the
conversation
then
became
more
audible
and
was
carried
on
at
considerable
length
i
should
perplex
myself
and
the
reader
by
endeavouring
to
follow
the
ingenious
perversity
of
all
they
said
enough
that
in
the
course
of
time
the
visit
came
to
an
end
and
mahaina
took
her
leave
receiving
affectionate
embraces
from
all
the
ladies
i
had
remained
in
the
background
after
the
first
ceremony
of
introduction
for
i
did
not
like
the
looks
of
mahaina
and
the
conversation
displeased
me
when
she
left
the
room
i
had
some
consolation
in
the
remarks
called
forth
by
her
departure
at
first
they
fell
to
praising
her
very
demurely
she
was
all
this
that
and
the
other
till
i
disliked
her
more
and
more
at
every
word
and
inquired
how
it
was
that
the
straighteners
had
not
been
able
to
cure
her
as
they
had
cured
nosnibor
there
was
a
shade
of
significance
on
nosnibor
face
as
i
said
this
which
seemed
to
imply
that
she
did
not
consider
mahaina
case
to
be
quite
one
for
a
straightener
it
flashed
across
me
that
perhaps
the
poor
woman
did
not
drink
at
all
i
knew
that
i
ought
not
to
have
inquired
but
i
could
not
help
it
and
asked
point
blank
whether
she
did
or
not
we
can
none
of
us
judge
of
the
condition
of
other
people
said
nosnibor
in
a
gravely
charitable
tone
and
with
a
look
towards
zulora
oh
mamma
answered
zulora
pretending
to
be
half
angry
but
rejoiced
at
being
able
to
say
out
what
she
was
already
longing
to
insinuate
i
believe
a
word
of
it
it
all
indigestion
i
remember
staying
in
the
house
with
her
for
a
whole
month
last
summer
and
i
am
sure
she
never
once
touched
a
drop
of
wine
or
spirits
the
fact
is
mahaina
is
a
very
weakly
girl
and
she
pretends
to
get
tipsy
in
order
to
win
a
forbearance
from
her
friends
to
which
she
is
not
entitled
she
is
not
strong
enough
for
her
calisthenic
exercises
and
she
knows
she
would
be
made
to
do
them
unless
her
inability
was
referred
to
moral
causes
here
the
younger
sister
who
was
ever
sweet
and
kind
remarked
that
she
thought
mahaina
did
tipple
occasionally
i
also
think
she
added
that
she
sometimes
takes
poppy
juice
well
then
perhaps
she
does
drink
sometimes
said
zulora
but
she
would
make
us
all
think
that
she
does
it
much
oftener
in
order
to
hide
her
weakness
and
so
they
went
on
for
half
an
hour
and
more
bandying
about
the
question
as
to
how
far
their
late
visitor
intemperance
was
real
or
no
every
now
and
then
they
would
join
in
some
charitable
commonplace
and
would
pretend
to
be
all
of
one
mind
that
mahaina
was
a
person
whose
bodily
health
would
be
excellent
if
it
were
not
for
her
unfortunate
inability
to
refrain
from
excessive
drinking
but
as
soon
as
this
appeared
to
be
fairly
settled
they
began
to
be
uncomfortable
until
they
had
undone
their
work
and
left
some
serious
imputation
upon
her
constitution
at
last
seeing
that
the
debate
had
assumed
the
character
of
a
cyclone
or
circular
storm
going
round
and
round
and
round
and
round
till
one
could
never
say
where
it
began
nor
where
it
ended
i
made
some
apology
for
an
abrupt
departure
and
retired
to
my
own
room
here
at
least
i
was
alone
but
i
was
very
unhappy
i
had
fallen
upon
a
set
of
people
who
in
spite
of
their
high
civilisation
and
many
excellences
had
been
so
warped
by
the
mistaken
views
presented
to
them
during
childhood
from
generation
to
generation
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
how
they
could
ever
clear
themselves
was
there
nothing
which
i
could
say
to
make
them
feel
that
the
constitution
of
a
person
body
was
a
thing
over
which
he
or
she
had
had
at
any
rate
no
initial
control
whatever
while
the
mind
was
a
perfectly
different
thing
and
capable
of
being
created
anew
and
directed
according
to
the
pleasure
of
its
possessor
could
i
never
bring
them
to
see
that
while
habits
of
mind
and
character
were
entirely
independent
of
initial
mental
force
and
early
education
the
body
was
so
much
a
creature
of
parentage
and
circumstances
that
no
punishment
for
should
be
ever
tolerated
save
as
a
protection
from
contagion
and
that
even
where
punishment
was
inevitable
it
should
be
attended
with
compassion
surely
if
the
unfortunate
mahaina
were
to
feel
that
she
could
avow
her
bodily
weakness
without
fear
of
being
despised
for
her
infirmities
and
if
there
were
medical
men
to
whom
she
could
fairly
state
her
case
she
would
not
hesitate
about
doing
so
through
the
fear
of
taking
nasty
medicine
it
was
possible
that
her
malady
was
incurable
for
i
had
heard
enough
to
convince
me
that
her
dipsomania
was
only
a
pretence
and
that
she
was
temperate
in
all
her
habits
in
that
case
she
might
perhaps
be
justly
subject
to
annoyances
or
even
to
restraint
but
who
could
say
whether
she
was
curable
or
not
until
she
was
able
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
her
symptoms
instead
of
concealing
them
in
their
eagerness
to
stamp
out
disease
these
people
overshot
their
mark
for
people
had
become
so
clever
at
dissembling
they
painted
their
faces
with
such
consummate
skill
they
repaired
the
decay
of
time
and
the
effects
of
mischance
with
such
profound
dissimulation
that
it
was
really
impossible
to
say
whether
any
one
was
well
or
ill
till
after
an
intimate
acquaintance
of
months
or
years
even
then
the
shrewdest
were
constantly
mistaken
in
their
judgements
and
marriages
were
often
contracted
with
most
deplorable
results
owing
to
the
art
with
which
infirmity
had
been
concealed
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
first
step
towards
the
cure
of
disease
should
be
the
announcement
of
the
fact
to
a
person
near
relations
and
friends
if
any
one
had
a
headache
he
ought
to
be
permitted
within
reasonable
limits
to
say
so
at
once
and
to
retire
to
his
own
bedroom
and
take
a
pill
without
every
one
looking
grave
and
tears
being
shed
and
all
the
rest
of
it
as
it
was
even
upon
hearing
it
whispered
that
somebody
else
was
subject
to
headaches
a
whole
company
must
look
as
though
they
had
never
had
a
headache
in
their
lives
it
is
true
they
were
not
very
prevalent
for
the
people
were
the
healthiest
and
most
comely
imaginable
owing
to
the
severity
with
which
ill
health
was
treated
still
even
the
best
were
liable
to
be
out
of
sorts
sometimes
and
there
were
few
families
that
had
not
a
in
a
cupboard
somewhere
chapter
xv
the
musical
banks
on
my
return
to
the
i
found
that
the
mahaina
current
had
expended
itself
the
ladies
were
just
putting
away
their
work
and
preparing
to
go
out
i
asked
them
where
they
were
going
they
answered
with
a
certain
air
of
reserve
that
they
were
going
to
the
bank
to
get
some
money
now
i
had
already
collected
that
the
mercantile
affairs
of
the
erewhonians
were
conducted
on
a
totally
different
system
from
our
own
i
had
however
gathered
little
hitherto
except
that
they
had
two
distinct
commercial
systems
of
which
the
one
appealed
more
strongly
to
the
imagination
than
anything
to
which
we
are
accustomed
in
europe
inasmuch
as
the
banks
that
were
conducted
upon
this
system
were
decorated
in
the
most
profuse
fashion
and
all
mercantile
transactions
were
accompanied
with
music
so
that
they
were
called
musical
banks
though
the
music
was
hideous
to
a
european
ear
as
for
the
system
itself
i
never
understood
it
neither
can
i
do
so
now
they
have
a
code
in
connection
with
it
which
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
they
understand
but
no
foreigner
can
hope
to
do
so
one
rule
runs
into
and
against
another
as
in
a
most
complicated
grammar
or
as
in
chinese
pronunciation
wherein
i
am
told
that
the
slightest
change
in
accentuation
or
tone
of
voice
alters
the
meaning
of
a
whole
sentence
whatever
is
incoherent
in
my
description
must
be
referred
to
the
fact
of
my
never
having
attained
to
a
full
comprehension
of
the
subject
so
far
however
as
i
could
collect
anything
certain
i
gathered
that
they
have
two
distinct
currencies
each
under
the
control
of
its
own
banks
and
mercantile
codes
one
of
these
the
one
with
the
musical
banks
was
supposed
to
be
system
and
to
give
out
the
currency
in
which
all
monetary
transactions
should
be
carried
on
and
as
far
as
i
could
see
all
who
wished
to
be
considered
respectable
kept
a
larger
or
smaller
balance
at
these
banks
on
the
other
hand
if
there
is
one
thing
of
which
i
am
more
sure
than
another
it
is
that
the
amount
so
kept
had
no
direct
commercial
value
in
the
outside
world
i
am
sure
that
the
managers
and
cashiers
of
the
musical
banks
were
not
paid
in
their
own
currency
nosnibor
used
to
go
to
these
banks
or
rather
to
the
great
mother
bank
of
the
city
sometimes
but
not
very
often
he
was
a
pillar
of
one
of
the
other
kind
of
banks
though
he
appeared
to
hold
some
minor
office
also
in
the
musical
ones
the
ladies
generally
went
alone
as
indeed
was
the
case
in
most
families
except
on
state
occasions
i
had
long
wanted
to
know
more
of
this
strange
system
and
had
the
greatest
desire
to
accompany
my
hostess
and
her
daughters
i
had
seen
them
go
out
almost
every
morning
since
my
arrival
and
had
noticed
that
they
carried
their
purses
in
their
hands
not
exactly
ostentatiously
yet
just
so
as
that
those
who
met
them
should
see
whither
they
were
going
i
had
never
however
yet
been
asked
to
go
with
them
myself
it
is
not
easy
to
convey
a
person
manner
by
words
and
i
can
hardly
give
any
idea
of
the
peculiar
feeling
that
came
upon
me
when
i
saw
the
ladies
on
the
point
of
starting
for
the
bank
there
was
a
something
of
regret
a
something
as
though
they
would
wish
to
take
me
with
them
but
did
not
like
to
ask
me
and
yet
as
though
i
were
hardly
to
ask
to
be
taken
i
was
determined
however
to
bring
matters
to
an
issue
with
my
hostess
about
my
going
with
them
and
after
a
little
parleying
and
many
inquiries
as
to
whether
i
was
perfectly
sure
that
i
myself
wished
to
go
it
was
decided
that
i
might
do
so
we
passed
through
several
streets
of
more
or
less
considerable
houses
and
at
last
turning
round
a
corner
we
came
upon
a
large
piazza
at
the
end
of
which
was
a
magnificent
building
of
a
strange
but
noble
architecture
and
of
great
antiquity
it
did
not
open
directly
on
to
the
piazza
there
being
a
screen
through
which
was
an
archway
between
the
piazza
and
the
actual
precincts
of
the
bank
on
passing
under
the
archway
we
entered
upon
a
green
sward
round
which
there
ran
an
arcade
or
cloister
while
in
front
of
us
uprose
the
majestic
towers
of
the
bank
and
its
venerable
front
which
was
divided
into
three
deep
recesses
and
adorned
with
all
sorts
of
marbles
and
many
sculptures
on
either
side
there
were
beautiful
old
trees
wherein
the
birds
were
busy
by
the
hundred
and
a
number
of
quaint
but
substantial
houses
of
singularly
comfortable
appearance
they
were
situated
in
the
midst
of
orchards
and
gardens
and
gave
me
an
impression
of
great
peace
and
plenty
indeed
it
had
been
no
error
to
say
that
this
building
was
one
that
appealed
to
the
imagination
it
did
more
it
carried
both
imagination
and
judgement
by
storm
it
was
an
epic
in
stone
and
marble
and
so
powerful
was
the
effect
it
produced
on
me
that
as
i
beheld
it
i
was
charmed
and
melted
i
felt
more
conscious
of
the
existence
of
a
remote
past
one
knows
of
this
always
but
the
knowledge
is
never
so
living
as
in
the
actual
presence
of
some
witness
to
the
life
of
bygone
ages
i
felt
how
short
a
space
of
human
life
was
the
period
of
our
own
existence
i
was
more
impressed
with
my
own
littleness
and
much
more
inclinable
to
believe
that
the
people
whose
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
was
equal
to
the
upraising
of
so
serene
a
handiwork
were
hardly
likely
to
be
wrong
in
the
conclusions
they
might
come
to
upon
any
subject
my
feeling
certainly
was
that
the
currency
of
this
bank
must
be
the
right
one
we
crossed
the
sward
and
entered
the
building
if
the
outside
had
been
impressive
the
inside
was
even
more
so
it
was
very
lofty
and
divided
into
several
parts
by
walls
which
rested
upon
massive
pillars
the
windows
were
filled
with
stained
glass
descriptive
of
the
principal
commercial
incidents
of
the
bank
for
many
ages
in
a
remote
part
of
the
building
there
were
men
and
boys
singing
this
was
the
only
disturbing
feature
for
as
the
gamut
was
still
unknown
there
was
no
music
in
the
country
which
could
be
agreeable
to
a
european
ear
the
singers
seemed
to
have
derived
their
inspirations
from
the
songs
of
birds
and
the
wailing
of
the
wind
which
last
they
tried
to
imitate
in
melancholy
cadences
that
at
times
degenerated
into
a
howl
to
my
thinking
the
noise
was
hideous
but
it
produced
a
great
effect
upon
my
companions
who
professed
themselves
much
moved
as
soon
as
the
singing
was
over
the
ladies
requested
me
to
stay
where
i
was
while
they
went
inside
the
place
from
which
it
had
seemed
to
come
during
their
absence
certain
reflections
forced
themselves
upon
me
in
the
first
place
it
struck
me
as
strange
that
the
building
should
be
so
nearly
empty
i
was
almost
alone
and
the
few
besides
myself
had
been
led
by
curiosity
and
had
no
intention
of
doing
business
with
the
bank
but
there
might
be
more
inside
i
stole
up
to
the
curtain
and
ventured
to
draw
the
extreme
edge
of
it
on
one
side
no
there
was
hardly
any
one
there
i
saw
a
large
number
of
cashiers
all
at
their
desks
ready
to
pay
cheques
and
one
or
two
who
seemed
to
be
the
managing
partners
i
also
saw
my
hostess
and
her
daughters
and
two
or
three
other
ladies
also
three
or
four
old
women
and
the
boys
from
one
of
the
neighbouring
colleges
of
unreason
but
there
was
no
one
else
this
did
not
look
as
though
the
bank
was
doing
a
very
large
business
and
yet
i
had
always
been
told
that
every
one
in
the
city
dealt
with
this
establishment
i
can
not
describe
all
that
took
place
in
these
inner
precincts
for
a
person
in
a
black
gown
came
and
made
unpleasant
gestures
at
me
for
peeping
i
happened
to
have
in
my
pocket
one
of
the
musical
bank
pieces
which
had
been
given
me
by
nosnibor
so
i
tried
to
tip
him
with
it
but
having
seen
what
it
was
he
became
so
angry
that
i
had
to
give
him
a
piece
of
the
other
kind
of
money
to
pacify
him
when
i
had
done
this
he
became
civil
directly
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
i
ventured
to
take
a
second
look
and
saw
zulora
in
the
very
act
of
giving
a
piece
of
paper
which
looked
like
a
cheque
to
one
of
the
cashiers
he
did
not
examine
it
but
putting
his
hand
into
an
antique
coffer
hard
by
he
pulled
out
a
quantity
of
metal
pieces
apparently
at
random
and
handed
them
over
without
counting
them
neither
did
zulora
count
them
but
put
them
into
her
purse
and
went
back
to
her
seat
after
dropping
a
few
pieces
of
the
other
coinage
into
an
alms
box
that
stood
by
the
cashier
side
nosnibor
and
arowhena
then
did
likewise
but
a
little
later
they
gave
all
so
far
as
i
could
see
that
they
had
received
from
the
cashier
back
to
a
verger
who
i
have
no
doubt
put
it
back
into
the
coffer
from
which
it
had
been
taken
they
then
began
making
towards
the
curtain
whereon
i
let
it
drop
and
retreated
to
a
reasonable
distance
they
soon
joined
me
for
some
few
minutes
we
all
kept
silence
but
at
last
i
ventured
to
remark
that
the
bank
was
not
so
busy
as
it
probably
often
was
on
this
nosnibor
said
that
it
was
indeed
melancholy
to
see
what
little
heed
people
paid
to
the
most
precious
of
all
institutions
i
could
say
nothing
in
reply
but
i
have
ever
been
of
opinion
that
the
greater
part
of
mankind
do
approximately
know
where
they
get
that
which
does
them
good
nosnibor
went
on
to
say
that
i
must
not
think
there
was
any
want
of
confidence
in
the
bank
because
i
had
seen
so
few
people
there
the
heart
of
the
country
was
thoroughly
devoted
to
these
establishments
and
any
sign
of
their
being
in
danger
would
bring
in
support
from
the
most
unexpected
quarters
it
was
only
because
people
knew
them
to
be
so
very
safe
that
in
some
cases
as
she
lamented
to
say
in
nosnibor
they
felt
that
their
support
was
unnecessary
moreover
these
institutions
never
departed
from
the
safest
and
most
approved
banking
principles
thus
they
never
allowed
interest
on
deposit
a
thing
now
frequently
done
by
certain
bubble
companies
which
by
doing
an
illegitimate
trade
had
drawn
many
customers
away
and
even
the
shareholders
were
fewer
than
formerly
owing
to
the
innovations
of
these
unscrupulous
persons
for
the
musical
banks
paid
little
or
no
dividend
but
divided
their
profits
by
way
of
bonus
on
the
original
shares
once
in
every
thirty
thousand
years
and
as
it
was
now
only
two
thousand
years
since
there
had
been
one
of
these
distributions
people
felt
that
they
could
not
hope
for
another
in
their
own
time
and
preferred
investments
whereby
they
got
some
more
tangible
return
all
which
she
said
was
very
melancholy
to
think
of
having
made
these
last
admissions
she
returned
to
her
original
statement
namely
that
every
one
in
the
country
really
supported
these
banks
as
to
the
fewness
of
the
people
and
the
absence
of
the
she
pointed
out
to
me
with
some
justice
that
this
was
exactly
what
we
ought
to
expect
the
men
who
were
most
conversant
about
the
stability
of
human
institutions
such
as
the
lawyers
men
of
science
doctors
statesmen
painters
and
the
like
were
just
those
who
were
most
likely
to
be
misled
by
their
own
fancied
accomplishments
and
to
be
made
unduly
suspicious
by
their
licentious
desire
for
greater
present
return
which
was
at
the
root
of
of
the
opposition
by
their
vanity
which
would
prompt
them
to
affect
superiority
to
the
prejudices
of
the
vulgar
and
by
the
stings
of
their
own
conscience
which
was
constantly
upbraiding
them
in
the
most
cruel
manner
on
account
of
their
bodies
which
were
generally
diseased
let
a
person
intellect
she
continued
be
never
so
sound
unless
his
body
is
in
absolute
health
he
can
form
no
judgement
worth
having
on
matters
of
this
kind
the
body
is
everything
it
need
not
perhaps
be
such
a
strong
body
she
said
this
because
she
saw
that
i
was
thinking
of
the
old
and
folks
whom
i
had
seen
in
the
bank
but
it
must
be
in
perfect
health
in
this
case
the
less
active
strength
it
had
the
more
free
would
be
the
working
of
the
intellect
and
therefore
the
sounder
the
conclusion
the
people
then
whom
i
had
seen
at
the
bank
were
in
reality
the
very
ones
whose
opinions
were
most
worth
having
they
declared
its
advantages
to
be
incalculable
and
even
professed
to
consider
the
immediate
return
to
be
far
larger
than
they
were
entitled
to
and
so
she
ran
on
nor
did
she
leave
off
till
we
had
got
back
to
the
house
she
might
say
what
she
pleased
but
her
manner
carried
no
conviction
and
later
on
i
saw
signs
of
general
indifference
to
these
banks
that
were
not
to
be
mistaken
their
supporters
often
denied
it
but
the
denial
was
generally
so
couched
as
to
add
another
proof
of
its
existence
in
commercial
panics
and
in
times
of
general
distress
the
people
as
a
mass
did
not
so
much
as
even
think
of
turning
to
these
banks
a
few
might
do
so
some
from
habit
and
early
training
some
from
the
instinct
that
prompts
us
to
catch
at
any
straw
when
we
think
ourselves
drowning
but
few
from
a
genuine
belief
that
the
musical
banks
could
save
them
from
financial
ruin
if
they
were
unable
to
meet
their
engagements
in
the
other
kind
of
currency
in
conversation
with
one
of
the
musical
bank
managers
i
ventured
to
hint
this
as
plainly
as
politeness
would
allow
he
said
that
it
had
been
more
or
less
true
till
lately
but
that
now
they
had
put
fresh
stained
glass
windows
into
all
the
banks
in
the
country
and
repaired
the
buildings
and
enlarged
the
organs
the
presidents
moreover
had
taken
to
riding
in
omnibuses
and
talking
nicely
to
people
in
the
streets
and
to
remembering
the
ages
of
their
children
and
giving
them
things
when
they
were
naughty
so
that
all
would
henceforth
go
smoothly
but
have
you
done
anything
to
the
money
itself
said
i
timidly
it
is
not
necessary
he
rejoined
not
in
the
least
necessary
i
assure
you
and
yet
any
one
could
see
that
the
money
given
out
at
these
banks
was
not
that
with
which
people
bought
their
bread
meat
and
clothing
it
was
like
it
at
a
first
glance
and
was
stamped
with
designs
that
were
often
of
great
beauty
it
was
not
again
a
spurious
coinage
made
with
the
intention
that
it
should
be
mistaken
for
the
money
in
actual
use
it
was
more
like
a
toy
money
or
the
counters
used
for
certain
games
at
cards
for
notwithstanding
the
beauty
of
the
designs
the
material
on
which
they
were
stamped
was
as
nearly
valueless
as
possible
some
were
covered
with
tin
foil
but
the
greater
part
were
frankly
of
a
cheap
base
metal
the
exact
nature
of
which
i
was
not
able
to
determine
indeed
they
were
made
of
a
great
variety
of
metals
or
perhaps
more
accurately
alloys
some
of
which
were
hard
while
others
would
bend
easily
and
assume
almost
any
form
which
their
possessor
might
desire
at
the
moment
of
course
every
one
knew
that
their
commercial
value
was
but
all
those
who
wished
to
be
considered
respectable
thought
it
incumbent
upon
them
to
retain
a
few
coins
in
their
possession
and
to
let
them
be
seen
from
time
to
time
in
their
hands
and
purses
not
only
this
but
they
would
stick
to
it
that
the
current
coin
of
the
realm
was
dross
in
comparison
with
the
musical
bank
coinage
perhaps
however
the
strangest
thing
of
all
was
that
these
very
people
would
at
times
make
fun
in
small
ways
of
the
whole
system
indeed
there
was
hardly
any
insinuation
against
it
which
they
would
not
tolerate
and
even
applaud
in
their
daily
newspapers
if
written
anonymously
while
if
the
same
thing
were
said
without
ambiguity
to
their
faces
nominative
case
verb
and
accusative
being
all
in
their
right
places
and
doubt
impossible
they
would
consider
themselves
very
seriously
and
justly
outraged
and
accuse
the
speaker
of
being
unwell
i
never
could
understand
neither
can
i
quite
do
so
now
though
i
begin
to
see
better
what
they
mean
why
a
single
currency
should
not
suffice
them
it
would
seem
to
me
as
though
all
their
dealings
would
have
been
thus
greatly
simplified
but
i
was
met
with
a
look
of
horror
if
ever
i
dared
to
hint
at
it
even
those
who
to
my
certain
knowledge
kept
only
just
enough
money
at
the
musical
banks
to
swear
by
would
call
the
other
banks
where
their
securities
really
lay
cold
deadening
paralysing
and
the
like
i
noticed
another
thing
moreover
which
struck
me
greatly
i
was
taken
to
the
opening
of
one
of
these
banks
in
a
neighbouring
town
and
saw
a
large
assemblage
of
cashiers
and
managers
i
sat
opposite
them
and
scanned
their
faces
attentively
they
did
not
please
me
they
lacked
with
few
exceptions
the
true
erewhonian
frankness
and
an
equal
number
from
any
other
class
would
have
looked
happier
and
better
men
when
i
met
them
in
the
streets
they
did
not
seem
like
other
people
but
had
as
a
general
rule
a
cramped
expression
upon
their
faces
which
pained
and
depressed
me
those
who
came
from
the
country
were
better
they
seemed
to
have
lived
less
as
a
separate
class
and
to
be
freer
and
healthier
but
in
spite
of
my
seeing
not
a
few
whose
looks
were
benign
and
noble
i
could
not
help
asking
myself
concerning
the
greater
number
of
those
whom
i
met
whether
erewhon
would
be
a
better
country
if
their
expression
were
to
be
transferred
to
the
people
in
general
i
answered
myself
emphatically
no
the
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
high
ydgrunites
was
that
which
one
would
wish
to
diffuse
and
not
that
of
the
cashiers
a
man
expression
is
his
sacrament
it
is
the
outward
and
visible
sign
of
his
inward
and
spiritual
grace
or
want
of
grace
and
as
i
looked
at
the
a
majority
of
these
men
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
there
must
be
a
something
in
their
lives
which
had
stunted
their
natural
development
and
that
they
would
have
been
more
healthily
minded
in
any
other
profession
i
was
always
sorry
for
them
for
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
they
were
persons
they
were
in
the
main
very
poorly
paid
their
constitutions
were
as
a
rule
above
suspicion
and
there
were
recorded
numberless
instances
of
their
and
generosity
but
they
had
had
the
misfortune
to
have
been
betrayed
into
a
false
position
at
an
age
for
the
most
part
when
their
judgement
was
not
matured
and
after
having
been
kept
in
studied
ignorance
of
the
real
difficulties
of
the
system
but
this
did
not
make
their
position
the
less
a
false
one
and
its
bad
effects
upon
themselves
were
unmistakable
few
people
would
speak
quite
openly
and
freely
before
them
which
struck
me
as
a
very
bad
sign
when
they
were
in
the
room
every
one
would
talk
as
though
all
currency
save
that
of
the
musical
banks
should
be
abolished
and
yet
they
knew
perfectly
well
that
even
the
cashiers
themselves
hardly
used
the
musical
bank
money
more
than
other
people
it
was
expected
of
them
that
they
should
appear
to
do
so
but
this
was
all
the
less
thoughtful
of
them
did
not
seem
particularly
unhappy
but
many
were
plainly
sick
at
heart
though
perhaps
they
hardly
knew
it
and
would
not
have
owned
to
being
so
some
few
were
opponents
of
the
whole
system
but
these
were
liable
to
be
dismissed
from
their
employment
at
any
moment
and
this
rendered
them
very
careful
for
a
man
who
had
once
been
cashier
at
a
musical
bank
was
out
of
the
field
for
other
employment
and
was
generally
unfitted
for
it
by
reason
of
that
course
of
treatment
which
was
commonly
called
his
education
in
fact
it
was
a
career
from
which
retreat
was
virtually
impossible
and
into
which
young
men
were
generally
induced
to
enter
before
they
could
be
reasonably
expected
considering
their
training
to
have
formed
any
opinions
of
their
own
not
unfrequently
indeed
they
were
induced
by
what
we
in
england
should
call
undue
influence
concealment
and
fraud
few
indeed
were
those
who
had
the
courage
to
insist
on
seeing
both
sides
of
the
question
before
they
committed
themselves
to
what
was
practically
a
leap
in
the
dark
one
would
have
thought
that
caution
in
this
respect
was
an
elementary
principle
one
of
the
first
things
that
an
honourable
man
would
teach
his
boy
to
understand
but
in
practice
it
was
not
so
i
even
saw
cases
in
which
parents
bought
the
right
of
presenting
to
the
office
of
cashier
at
one
of
these
banks
with
the
fixed
determination
that
some
one
of
their
sons
perhaps
a
mere
child
should
fill
it
there
was
the
lad
himself
growing
up
with
every
promise
of
becoming
a
good
and
honourable
man
but
utterly
without
warning
concerning
the
iron
shoe
which
his
natural
protector
was
providing
for
him
who
could
say
that
the
whole
thing
would
not
end
in
a
lie
and
vain
chafing
to
escape
i
confess
that
there
were
few
things
in
erewhon
which
shocked
me
more
than
this
yet
we
do
something
not
so
very
different
from
this
even
in
england
and
as
regards
the
dual
commercial
system
all
countries
have
and
have
had
a
law
of
the
land
and
also
another
law
which
though
professedly
more
sacred
has
far
less
effect
on
their
daily
life
and
actions
it
seems
as
though
the
need
for
some
law
over
and
above
and
sometimes
even
conflicting
with
the
law
of
the
land
must
spring
from
something
that
lies
deep
down
in
man
nature
indeed
it
is
hard
to
think
that
man
could
ever
have
become
man
at
all
but
for
the
gradual
evolution
of
a
perception
that
though
this
world
looms
so
large
when
we
are
in
it
it
may
seem
a
little
thing
when
we
have
got
away
from
it
when
man
had
grown
to
the
perception
that
in
the
everlasting
not
of
nature
the
world
and
all
that
it
contains
including
man
is
at
the
same
time
both
seen
and
unseen
he
felt
the
need
of
two
rules
of
life
one
for
the
seen
and
the
other
for
the
unseen
side
of
things
for
the
laws
affecting
the
seen
world
he
claimed
the
sanction
of
seen
powers
for
the
unseen
of
which
he
knows
nothing
save
that
it
exists
and
is
powerful
he
appealed
to
the
unseen
power
of
which
again
he
knows
nothing
save
that
it
exists
and
is
powerful
to
which
he
gives
the
name
of
god
some
erewhonian
opinions
concerning
the
intelligence
of
the
unborn
embryo
that
i
regret
my
space
will
not
permit
me
to
lay
before
the
reader
have
led
me
to
conclude
that
the
erewhonian
musical
banks
and
perhaps
the
religious
systems
of
all
countries
are
now
more
or
less
of
an
attempt
to
uphold
the
unfathomable
and
unconscious
instinctive
wisdom
of
millions
of
past
generations
against
the
comparatively
shallow
consciously
reasoning
and
ephemeral
conclusions
drawn
from
that
of
the
last
thirty
or
forty
the
saving
feature
of
the
erewhonian
musical
bank
system
as
distinct
from
the
views
which
coexist
with
it
and
on
which
i
will
touch
later
was
that
while
it
bore
witness
to
the
existence
of
a
kingdom
that
is
not
of
this
world
it
made
no
attempt
to
pierce
the
veil
that
hides
it
from
human
eyes
it
is
here
that
almost
all
religions
go
wrong
their
priests
try
to
make
us
believe
that
they
know
more
about
the
unseen
world
than
those
whose
eyes
are
still
blinded
by
the
seen
can
ever
know
forgetting
that
while
to
deny
the
existence
of
an
unseen
kingdom
is
bad
to
pretend
that
we
know
more
about
it
than
its
bare
existence
is
no
better
this
chapter
is
already
longer
than
i
intended
but
i
should
like
to
say
that
in
spite
of
the
saving
feature
of
which
i
have
just
spoken
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
erewhonians
are
on
the
eve
of
some
great
change
in
their
religious
opinions
or
at
any
rate
in
that
part
of
them
which
finds
expression
through
their
musical
banks
so
far
as
i
could
see
fully
ninety
per
cent
of
the
population
of
the
metropolis
looked
upon
these
banks
with
something
not
far
removed
from
contempt
if
this
is
so
any
such
startling
event
as
is
sure
to
arise
sooner
or
later
may
serve
as
nucleus
to
a
new
order
of
things
that
will
be
more
in
harmony
with
both
the
heads
and
hearts
of
the
people
chapter
xvi
arowhena
the
reader
will
perhaps
have
learned
by
this
time
a
thing
which
i
had
myself
suspected
before
i
had
been
hours
in
house
i
mean
that
though
the
nosnibors
showed
me
every
attention
i
could
not
cordially
like
them
with
the
exception
of
arowhena
who
was
quite
different
from
the
rest
they
were
not
fair
samples
of
erewhonians
i
saw
many
families
with
whom
they
were
on
visiting
terms
whose
manners
charmed
me
more
than
i
know
how
to
say
but
i
never
could
get
over
my
original
prejudice
against
nosnibor
for
having
embezzled
the
money
nosnibor
too
was
a
very
worldly
woman
yet
to
hear
her
talk
one
would
have
thought
that
she
was
singularly
the
reverse
neither
could
i
endure
zulora
arowhena
however
was
perfection
she
it
was
who
ran
all
the
little
errands
for
her
mother
and
nosnibor
and
zulora
and
gave
those
thousand
proofs
of
sweetness
and
unselfishness
which
some
one
member
of
a
family
is
generally
required
to
give
all
day
long
it
was
arowhena
this
and
arowhena
that
but
she
never
seemed
to
know
that
she
was
being
put
upon
and
was
always
bright
and
willing
from
morning
till
evening
zulora
certainly
was
very
handsome
but
arowhena
was
infinitely
the
more
graceful
of
the
two
and
was
the
very
plus
of
youth
and
beauty
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
her
for
anything
that
i
could
say
would
fall
so
far
short
of
the
reality
as
only
to
mislead
the
reader
let
him
think
of
the
very
loveliest
that
he
can
imagine
and
he
will
still
be
below
the
truth
having
said
this
much
i
need
hardly
say
that
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
she
must
have
seen
what
i
felt
for
her
but
i
tried
my
hardest
not
to
let
it
appear
even
by
the
slightest
sign
i
had
many
reasons
for
this
i
had
no
idea
what
and
nosnibor
would
say
to
it
and
i
knew
that
arowhena
would
not
look
at
me
at
any
rate
not
yet
if
her
father
and
mother
disapproved
which
they
probably
would
considering
that
i
had
nothing
except
the
pension
of
about
a
pound
a
day
of
our
money
which
the
king
had
granted
me
i
did
not
yet
know
of
a
more
serious
obstacle
in
the
meantime
i
may
say
that
i
had
been
presented
at
court
and
was
told
that
my
reception
had
been
considered
as
singularly
gracious
indeed
i
had
several
interviews
both
with
the
king
and
queen
at
which
from
time
to
time
the
queen
got
everything
from
me
that
i
had
in
the
world
clothes
and
all
except
the
two
buttons
i
had
given
to
yram
the
loss
of
which
seemed
to
annoy
her
a
good
deal
i
was
presented
with
a
court
suit
and
her
majesty
had
my
old
clothes
put
upon
a
wooden
dummy
on
which
they
probably
remain
unless
they
have
been
removed
in
consequence
of
my
subsequent
downfall
his
majesty
manners
were
those
of
a
cultivated
english
gentleman
he
was
much
pleased
at
hearing
that
our
government
was
monarchical
and
that
the
mass
of
the
people
were
resolute
that
it
should
not
be
changed
indeed
i
was
so
much
encouraged
by
the
evident
pleasure
with
which
he
heard
me
that
i
ventured
to
quote
to
him
those
beautiful
lines
of
shakespeare
there
a
divinity
doth
hedge
a
king
rough
hew
him
how
we
may
but
i
was
sorry
i
had
done
so
afterwards
for
i
do
not
think
his
majesty
admired
the
lines
as
much
as
i
could
have
wished
there
is
no
occasion
for
me
to
dwell
further
upon
my
experience
of
the
court
but
i
ought
perhaps
to
allude
to
one
of
my
conversations
with
the
king
inasmuch
as
it
was
pregnant
with
the
most
important
consequences
he
had
been
asking
me
about
my
watch
and
enquiring
whether
such
dangerous
inventions
were
tolerated
in
the
country
from
which
i
came
i
owned
with
some
confusion
that
watches
were
not
uncommon
but
observing
the
gravity
which
came
over
his
majesty
face
i
presumed
to
say
that
they
were
fast
dying
out
and
that
we
had
few
if
any
other
mechanical
contrivances
of
which
he
was
likely
to
disapprove
upon
his
asking
me
to
name
some
of
our
most
advanced
machines
i
did
not
dare
to
tell
him
of
our
and
railroads
and
electric
telegraphs
and
was
puzzling
my
brains
to
think
what
i
could
say
when
of
all
things
in
the
world
balloons
suggested
themselves
and
i
gave
him
an
account
of
a
very
remarkable
ascent
which
was
made
some
years
ago
the
king
was
too
polite
to
contradict
but
i
felt
sure
that
he
did
not
believe
me
and
from
that
day
forward
though
he
always
showed
me
the
attention
which
was
due
to
my
genius
for
in
this
light
was
my
complexion
regarded
he
never
questioned
me
about
the
manners
and
customs
of
my
country
to
return
however
to
arowhena
i
soon
gathered
that
neither
nor
nosnibor
would
have
any
objection
to
my
marrying
into
the
family
a
physical
excellence
is
considered
in
erewhon
as
a
set
off
against
almost
any
other
disqualification
and
my
light
hair
was
sufficient
to
make
me
an
eligible
match
but
along
with
this
welcome
fact
i
gathered
another
which
filled
me
with
dismay
i
was
expected
to
marry
zulora
for
whom
i
had
already
conceived
a
great
aversion
at
first
i
hardly
noticed
the
little
hints
and
the
artifices
which
were
resorted
to
in
order
to
bring
us
together
but
after
a
time
they
became
too
plain
zulora
whether
she
was
in
love
with
me
or
not
was
bent
on
marrying
me
and
i
gathered
in
talking
with
a
young
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
who
frequently
visited
the
house
and
whom
i
greatly
disliked
that
it
was
considered
a
sacred
and
inviolable
rule
that
whoever
married
into
a
family
must
marry
the
eldest
daughter
at
that
time
unmarried
the
young
gentleman
urged
this
upon
me
so
frequently
that
i
at
last
saw
he
was
in
love
with
arowhena
himself
and
wanted
me
to
get
zulora
out
of
the
way
but
others
told
me
the
same
story
as
to
the
custom
of
the
country
and
i
saw
there
was
a
serious
difficulty
my
only
comfort
was
that
arowhena
snubbed
my
rival
and
would
not
look
at
him
neither
would
she
look
at
me
nevertheless
there
was
a
difference
in
the
manner
of
her
disregard
this
was
all
i
could
get
from
her
not
that
she
avoided
me
on
the
contrary
i
had
many
a
with
her
for
her
mother
and
sister
were
anxious
for
me
to
deposit
some
part
of
my
pension
in
the
musical
banks
this
being
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
their
goddess
ydgrun
of
whom
both
nosnibor
and
zulora
were
great
devotees
i
was
not
sure
whether
i
had
kept
my
secret
from
being
perceived
by
arowhena
herself
but
none
of
the
others
suspected
me
so
she
was
set
upon
me
to
get
me
to
open
an
account
at
any
rate
with
the
musical
banks
and
i
need
hardly
say
that
she
succeeded
but
i
did
not
yield
at
once
i
enjoyed
the
process
of
being
argued
with
too
keenly
to
lose
it
by
a
prompt
concession
besides
a
little
hesitation
rendered
the
concession
itself
more
valuable
it
was
in
the
course
of
conversations
on
this
subject
that
i
learned
the
more
defined
religious
opinions
of
the
erewhonians
that
coexist
with
the
musical
bank
system
but
are
not
recognised
by
those
curious
institutions
i
will
describe
them
as
briefly
as
possible
in
the
following
chapters
before
i
return
to
the
personal
adventures
of
arowhena
and
myself
they
were
idolaters
though
of
a
comparatively
enlightened
kind
but
here
as
in
other
things
there
was
a
discrepancy
between
their
professed
and
actual
belief
for
they
had
a
genuine
and
potent
faith
which
existed
without
recognition
alongside
of
their
idol
worship
the
gods
whom
they
worship
openly
are
personifications
of
human
qualities
as
justice
strength
hope
fear
love
the
people
think
that
prototypes
of
these
have
a
real
objective
existence
in
a
region
far
beyond
the
clouds
holding
as
did
the
ancients
that
they
are
like
men
and
women
both
in
body
and
passion
except
that
they
are
even
comelier
and
more
powerful
and
also
that
they
can
render
themselves
invisible
to
human
eyesight
they
are
capable
of
being
propitiated
by
mankind
and
of
coming
to
the
assistance
of
those
who
ask
their
aid
their
interest
in
human
affairs
is
keen
and
on
the
whole
beneficent
but
they
become
very
angry
if
neglected
and
punish
rather
the
first
they
come
upon
than
the
actual
person
who
has
offended
them
their
fury
being
blind
when
it
is
raised
though
never
raised
without
reason
they
will
not
punish
with
any
less
severity
when
people
sin
against
them
from
ignorance
and
without
the
chance
of
having
had
knowledge
they
will
take
no
excuses
of
this
kind
but
are
even
as
the
english
law
which
assumes
itself
to
be
known
to
every
one
thus
they
have
a
law
that
two
pieces
of
matter
may
not
occupy
the
same
space
at
the
same
moment
which
law
is
presided
over
and
administered
by
the
gods
of
time
and
space
jointly
so
that
if
a
flying
stone
and
a
head
attempt
to
outrage
these
gods
by
arrogating
a
right
which
they
do
not
possess
for
so
it
is
written
in
one
of
their
books
and
to
occupy
the
same
space
simultaneously
a
severe
punishment
sometimes
even
death
itself
is
sure
to
follow
without
any
regard
to
whether
the
stone
knew
that
the
man
head
was
there
or
the
head
the
stone
this
at
least
is
their
view
of
the
common
accidents
of
life
moreover
they
hold
their
deities
to
be
quite
regardless
of
motives
with
them
it
is
the
thing
done
which
is
everything
and
the
motive
goes
for
nothing
thus
they
hold
it
strictly
forbidden
for
a
man
to
go
without
common
air
in
his
lungs
for
more
than
a
very
few
minutes
and
if
by
any
chance
he
gets
into
the
water
the
is
very
angry
and
will
not
suffer
it
no
matter
whether
the
man
got
into
the
water
by
accident
or
on
purpose
whether
through
the
attempt
to
save
a
child
or
through
presumptuous
contempt
of
the
the
will
kill
him
unless
he
keeps
his
head
high
enough
out
of
the
water
and
thus
gives
the
his
due
this
with
regard
to
the
deities
who
manage
physical
affairs
over
and
above
these
they
personify
hope
fear
love
and
so
forth
giving
them
temples
and
priests
and
carving
likenesses
of
them
in
stone
which
they
verily
believe
to
be
faithful
representations
of
living
beings
who
are
only
not
human
in
being
more
than
human
if
any
one
denies
the
objective
existence
of
these
divinities
and
says
that
there
is
really
no
such
being
as
a
beautiful
woman
called
justice
with
her
eyes
blinded
and
a
pair
of
scales
positively
living
and
moving
in
a
remote
and
ethereal
region
but
that
justice
is
only
the
personified
expression
of
certain
modes
of
human
thought
and
action
they
say
that
he
denies
the
existence
of
justice
in
denying
her
personality
and
that
he
is
a
wanton
disturber
of
men
religious
convictions
they
detest
nothing
so
much
as
any
attempt
to
lead
them
to
higher
spiritual
conceptions
of
the
deities
whom
they
profess
to
worship
arowhena
and
i
had
a
pitched
battle
on
this
point
and
should
have
had
many
more
but
for
my
prudence
in
allowing
her
to
get
the
better
of
me
i
am
sure
that
in
her
heart
she
was
suspicious
of
her
own
position
for
she
returned
more
than
once
to
the
subject
can
you
not
see
i
had
exclaimed
that
the
fact
of
justice
being
admirable
will
not
be
affected
by
the
absence
of
a
belief
in
her
being
also
a
living
agent
can
you
really
think
that
men
will
be
one
whit
less
hopeful
because
they
no
longer
believe
that
hope
is
an
actual
person
she
shook
her
head
and
said
that
with
men
belief
in
the
personality
all
incentive
to
the
reverence
of
the
thing
itself
as
justice
or
hope
would
cease
men
from
that
hour
would
never
be
either
just
or
hopeful
again
i
could
not
move
her
nor
indeed
did
i
seriously
wish
to
do
so
she
deferred
to
me
in
most
things
but
she
never
shrank
from
maintaining
her
opinions
if
they
were
put
in
question
nor
does
she
to
this
day
abate
one
jot
of
her
belief
in
the
religion
of
her
childhood
though
in
compliance
with
my
repeated
entreaties
she
has
allowed
herself
to
be
baptized
into
the
english
church
she
has
however
made
a
gloss
upon
her
original
faith
to
the
effect
that
her
baby
and
i
are
the
only
human
beings
exempt
from
the
vengeance
of
the
deities
for
not
believing
in
their
personality
she
is
quite
clear
that
we
are
exempted
she
should
never
have
so
strong
a
conviction
of
it
otherwise
how
it
has
come
about
she
does
not
know
neither
does
she
wish
to
know
there
are
things
which
it
is
better
not
to
know
and
this
is
one
of
them
but
when
i
tell
her
that
i
believe
in
her
deities
as
much
as
she
does
and
that
it
is
a
difference
about
words
not
things
she
becomes
silent
with
a
slight
emphasis
i
own
that
she
very
nearly
conquered
me
once
for
she
asked
me
what
i
should
think
if
she
were
to
tell
me
that
my
god
whose
nature
and
attributes
i
had
been
explaining
to
her
was
but
the
expression
for
highest
conception
of
goodness
wisdom
and
power
that
in
order
to
generate
a
more
vivid
conception
of
so
great
and
glorious
a
thought
man
had
personified
it
and
called
it
by
a
name
that
it
was
an
unworthy
conception
of
the
deity
to
hold
him
personal
inasmuch
as
escape
from
human
contingencies
became
thus
impossible
that
the
real
thing
men
should
worship
was
the
divine
whereinsoever
they
could
find
it
that
god
was
but
man
way
of
expressing
his
sense
of
the
divine
that
as
justice
hope
wisdom
were
all
parts
of
goodness
so
god
was
the
expression
which
embraced
all
goodness
and
all
good
power
that
people
would
no
more
cease
to
love
god
on
ceasing
to
believe
in
his
objective
personality
than
they
had
ceased
to
love
justice
on
discovering
that
she
was
not
really
personal
nay
that
they
would
never
truly
love
him
till
they
saw
him
thus
she
said
all
this
in
her
artless
way
and
with
none
of
the
coherence
with
which
i
have
here
written
it
her
face
kindled
and
she
felt
sure
that
she
had
convinced
me
that
i
was
wrong
and
that
justice
was
a
living
person
indeed
i
did
wince
a
little
but
i
recovered
myself
immediately
and
pointed
out
to
her
that
we
had
books
whose
genuineness
was
beyond
all
possibility
of
doubt
as
they
were
certainly
none
of
them
less
than
years
old
that
in
these
there
were
the
most
authentic
accounts
of
men
who
had
been
spoken
to
by
the
deity
himself
and
of
one
prophet
who
had
been
allowed
to
see
the
back
parts
of
god
through
the
hand
that
was
laid
over
his
face
this
was
conclusive
and
i
spoke
with
such
solemnity
that
she
was
a
little
frightened
and
only
answered
that
they
too
had
their
books
in
which
their
ancestors
had
seen
the
gods
on
which
i
saw
that
further
argument
was
not
at
all
likely
to
convince
her
and
fearing
that
she
might
tell
her
mother
what
i
had
been
saying
and
that
i
might
lose
the
hold
upon
her
affections
which
i
was
beginning
to
feel
pretty
sure
that
i
was
obtaining
i
began
to
let
her
have
her
own
way
and
to
convince
me
neither
till
after
we
were
safely
married
did
i
show
the
cloven
hoof
again
nevertheless
her
remarks
have
haunted
me
and
i
have
since
met
with
many
very
godly
people
who
have
had
a
great
knowledge
of
divinity
but
no
sense
of
the
divine
and
again
i
have
seen
a
radiance
upon
the
face
of
those
who
were
worshipping
the
divine
either
in
art
or
nature
in
picture
or
statue
in
field
or
cloud
or
sea
in
man
woman
or
child
which
i
have
never
seen
kindled
by
any
talking
about
the
nature
and
attributes
of
god
mention
but
the
word
divinity
and
our
sense
of
the
divine
is
clouded
chapter
xvii
ydgrun
and
the
ydgrunites
in
spite
of
all
the
they
make
about
their
idols
and
the
temples
they
build
and
the
priests
and
priestesses
whom
they
support
i
could
never
think
that
their
professed
religion
was
more
than
but
they
had
another
which
they
carried
with
them
into
all
their
actions
and
although
no
one
from
the
outside
of
things
would
suspect
it
to
have
any
existence
at
all
it
was
in
reality
their
great
guide
the
compass
of
their
lives
so
that
there
were
very
few
things
which
they
ever
either
did
or
refrained
from
doing
without
reference
to
its
precepts
now
i
suspected
that
their
professed
faith
had
no
great
hold
upon
them
firstly
because
i
often
heard
the
priests
complain
of
the
prevailing
indifference
and
they
would
hardly
have
done
so
without
reason
secondly
because
of
the
show
which
was
made
for
there
was
none
of
this
about
the
worship
of
the
goddess
ydgrun
in
whom
they
really
did
believe
thirdly
because
though
the
priests
were
constantly
abusing
ydgrun
as
being
the
great
enemy
of
the
gods
it
was
well
known
that
she
had
no
more
devoted
worshippers
in
the
whole
country
than
these
very
persons
who
were
often
priests
of
ydgrun
rather
than
of
their
own
deities
neither
am
i
by
any
means
sure
that
these
were
not
the
best
of
the
priests
ydgrun
certainly
occupied
a
very
anomalous
position
she
was
held
to
be
both
omnipresent
and
omnipotent
but
she
was
not
an
elevated
conception
and
was
sometimes
both
cruel
and
absurd
even
her
most
devoted
worshippers
were
a
little
ashamed
of
her
and
served
her
more
with
heart
and
in
deed
than
with
their
tongues
theirs
was
no
lip
service
on
the
contrary
even
when
worshipping
her
most
devoutly
they
would
often
deny
her
take
her
all
in
all
however
she
was
a
beneficent
and
useful
deity
who
did
not
care
how
much
she
was
denied
so
long
as
she
was
obeyed
and
feared
and
who
kept
hundreds
of
thousands
in
those
paths
which
make
life
tolerably
happy
who
would
never
have
been
kept
there
otherwise
and
over
whom
a
higher
and
more
spiritual
ideal
would
have
had
no
power
i
greatly
doubt
whether
the
erewhonians
are
yet
prepared
for
any
better
religion
and
though
considering
my
gradually
strengthened
conviction
that
they
were
the
representatives
of
the
lost
tribes
of
israel
i
would
have
set
about
converting
them
at
all
hazards
had
i
seen
the
remotest
prospect
of
success
i
could
hardly
contemplate
the
displacement
of
ydgrun
as
the
great
central
object
of
their
regard
without
admitting
that
it
would
be
attended
with
frightful
consequences
in
fact
were
i
a
mere
philosopher
i
should
say
that
the
gradual
raising
of
the
popular
conception
of
ydgrun
would
be
the
greatest
spiritual
boon
which
could
be
conferred
upon
them
and
that
nothing
could
effect
this
except
example
i
generally
found
that
those
who
complained
most
loudly
that
ydgrun
was
not
high
enough
for
them
had
hardly
as
yet
come
up
to
the
ydgrun
standard
and
i
often
met
with
a
class
of
men
whom
i
called
to
myself
high
ydgrunites
the
rest
being
ydgrunites
and
low
ydgrunites
who
in
the
matter
of
human
conduct
and
the
affairs
of
life
appeared
to
me
to
have
got
about
as
far
as
it
is
in
the
right
nature
of
man
to
go
they
were
gentlemen
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
and
what
has
one
not
said
in
saying
this
they
seldom
spoke
of
ydgrun
or
even
alluded
to
her
but
would
never
run
counter
to
her
dictates
without
ample
reason
for
doing
so
in
such
cases
they
would
override
her
with
due
and
the
goddess
seldom
punished
them
for
they
are
brave
and
ydgrun
is
not
they
had
most
of
them
a
smattering
of
the
hypothetical
language
and
some
few
more
than
this
but
only
a
few
i
do
not
think
that
this
language
has
had
much
hand
in
making
them
what
they
are
but
rather
that
the
fact
of
their
being
generally
possessed
of
its
rudiments
was
one
great
reason
for
the
reverence
paid
to
the
hypothetical
language
itself
being
inured
from
youth
to
exercises
and
athletics
of
all
sorts
and
living
fearlessly
under
the
eye
of
their
peers
among
whom
there
exists
a
high
standard
of
courage
generosity
honour
and
every
good
and
manly
quality
what
wonder
that
they
should
have
become
so
to
speak
a
law
unto
themselves
and
while
taking
an
elevated
view
of
the
goddess
ydgrun
they
should
have
gradually
lost
all
faith
in
the
recognised
deities
of
the
country
these
they
do
not
openly
disregard
for
conformity
until
absolutely
intolerable
is
a
law
of
ydgrun
yet
they
have
no
real
belief
in
the
objective
existence
of
beings
which
so
readily
explain
themselves
as
abstractions
and
whose
personality
demands
a
materialism
which
it
baffles
the
imagination
to
realise
they
keep
their
opinions
however
greatly
to
themselves
inasmuch
as
most
of
their
countrymen
feel
strongly
about
the
gods
and
they
hold
it
wrong
to
give
pain
unless
for
some
greater
good
than
seems
likely
to
arise
from
their
plain
speaking
on
the
other
hand
surely
those
whose
own
minds
are
clear
about
any
given
matter
even
though
it
be
only
that
there
is
little
certainty
should
go
so
far
towards
imparting
that
clearness
to
others
as
to
say
openly
what
they
think
and
why
they
think
it
whenever
they
can
properly
do
so
for
they
may
be
sure
that
they
owe
their
own
clearness
almost
entirely
to
the
fact
that
others
have
done
this
by
them
after
all
they
may
be
mistaken
and
if
so
it
is
for
their
own
and
the
general
that
they
should
let
their
error
be
seen
as
distinctly
as
possible
so
that
it
may
be
more
easily
refuted
i
own
therefore
that
on
this
one
point
i
disapproved
of
the
practice
even
of
the
highest
ydgrunites
and
objected
to
it
all
the
more
because
i
knew
that
i
should
find
my
own
future
task
more
easy
if
the
high
ydgrunites
had
already
undermined
the
belief
which
is
supposed
to
prevail
at
present
in
other
respects
they
were
more
like
the
best
class
of
englishmen
than
any
whom
i
have
seen
in
other
countries
i
should
have
liked
to
have
persuaded
of
them
to
come
over
to
england
and
go
upon
the
stage
for
they
had
most
of
them
a
keen
sense
of
humour
and
a
taste
for
acting
they
would
be
of
great
use
to
us
the
example
of
a
real
gentleman
is
if
i
may
say
so
without
profanity
the
best
of
all
gospels
such
a
man
upon
the
stage
becomes
a
potent
humanising
influence
an
ideal
which
all
may
look
upon
for
a
shilling
i
always
liked
and
admired
these
men
and
although
i
could
not
help
deeply
regretting
their
certain
ultimate
perdition
for
they
had
no
sense
of
a
hereafter
and
their
only
religion
was
that
of
and
consideration
for
other
people
i
never
dared
to
take
so
great
a
liberty
with
them
as
to
attempt
to
put
them
in
possession
of
my
own
religious
convictions
in
spite
of
my
knowing
that
they
were
the
only
ones
which
could
make
them
really
good
and
happy
either
here
or
hereafter
i
did
try
sometimes
being
impelled
to
do
so
by
a
strong
sense
of
duty
and
by
my
deep
regret
that
so
much
that
was
admirable
should
be
doomed
to
ages
if
not
eternity
of
torture
but
the
words
stuck
in
my
throat
as
soon
as
i
began
whether
a
professional
missionary
might
have
a
better
chance
i
know
not
such
persons
must
doubtless
know
more
about
the
science
of
conversion
for
myself
i
could
only
be
thankful
that
i
was
in
the
right
path
and
was
obliged
to
let
others
take
their
chance
as
yet
if
the
plan
fails
by
which
i
propose
to
convert
them
myself
i
would
gladly
contribute
my
mite
towards
the
sending
two
or
three
trained
missionaries
who
have
been
known
as
successful
converters
of
jews
and
mahometans
but
such
have
seldom
much
to
glory
in
the
flesh
and
when
i
think
of
the
high
ydgrunites
and
of
the
figure
which
a
missionary
would
probably
cut
among
them
i
can
not
feel
sanguine
that
much
good
would
be
arrived
at
still
the
attempt
is
worth
making
and
the
worst
danger
to
the
missionaries
themselves
would
be
that
of
being
sent
to
the
hospital
where
chowbok
would
have
been
sent
had
he
come
with
me
into
erewhon
taking
then
their
religious
opinions
as
a
whole
i
must
own
that
the
erewhonians
are
superstitious
on
account
of
the
views
which
they
hold
of
their
professed
gods
and
their
entirely
anomalous
and
inexplicable
worship
of
ydgrun
a
worship
at
once
the
most
powerful
yet
most
devoid
of
formalism
that
i
ever
met
with
but
in
practice
things
worked
better
than
might
have
been
expected
and
the
conflicting
claims
of
ydgrun
and
the
gods
were
arranged
by
unwritten
compromises
for
the
most
part
in
ydgrun
favour
which
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
were
very
well
understood
i
could
not
conceive
why
they
should
not
openly
acknowledge
high
ydgrunism
and
discard
the
objective
personality
of
hope
justice
but
whenever
i
so
much
as
hinted
at
this
i
found
that
i
was
on
dangerous
ground
they
would
never
have
it
returning
constantly
to
the
assertion
that
ages
ago
the
divinities
were
frequently
seen
and
that
the
moment
their
personality
was
disbelieved
in
men
would
leave
off
practising
even
those
ordinary
virtues
which
the
common
experience
of
mankind
has
agreed
on
as
being
the
greatest
secret
of
happiness
who
ever
heard
they
asked
indignantly
of
such
things
as
kindly
training
a
good
example
and
an
enlightened
regard
to
one
own
welfare
being
able
to
keep
men
straight
in
my
hurry
forgetting
things
which
i
ought
to
have
remembered
i
answered
that
if
a
person
could
not
be
kept
straight
by
these
things
there
was
nothing
that
could
straighten
him
and
that
if
he
were
not
ruled
by
the
love
and
fear
of
men
whom
he
had
seen
neither
would
he
be
so
by
that
of
the
gods
whom
he
had
not
seen
at
one
time
indeed
i
came
upon
a
small
but
growing
sect
who
believed
after
a
fashion
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
they
taught
that
those
who
had
been
born
with
feeble
and
diseased
bodies
and
had
passed
their
lives
in
ailing
would
be
tortured
eternally
hereafter
but
that
those
who
had
been
born
strong
and
healthy
and
handsome
would
be
rewarded
for
ever
and
ever
of
moral
qualities
or
conduct
they
made
no
mention
bad
as
this
was
it
was
a
step
in
advance
inasmuch
as
they
did
hold
out
a
future
state
of
some
sort
and
i
was
shocked
to
find
that
for
the
most
part
they
met
with
opposition
on
the
score
that
their
doctrine
was
based
upon
no
sort
of
foundation
also
that
it
was
immoral
in
its
tendency
and
not
to
be
desired
by
any
reasonable
beings
when
i
asked
how
it
could
be
immoral
i
was
answered
that
if
firmly
held
it
would
lead
people
to
cheapen
this
present
life
making
it
appear
to
be
an
affair
of
only
secondary
importance
that
it
would
thus
distract
men
minds
from
the
perfecting
of
this
world
economy
and
was
an
impatient
cutting
so
to
speak
of
the
gordian
knot
of
life
problems
whereby
some
people
might
gain
present
satisfaction
to
themselves
at
the
cost
of
infinite
damage
to
others
that
the
doctrine
tended
to
encourage
the
poor
in
their
improvidence
and
in
a
debasing
acquiescence
in
ills
which
they
might
well
remedy
that
the
rewards
were
illusory
and
the
result
after
all
of
luck
whose
empire
should
be
bounded
by
the
grave
that
its
terrors
were
enervating
and
unjust
and
that
even
the
most
blessed
rising
would
be
but
the
disturbing
of
a
still
more
blessed
slumber
to
all
which
i
could
only
say
that
the
thing
had
been
actually
known
to
happen
and
that
there
were
several
instances
of
people
having
died
and
come
to
life
again
instances
which
no
man
in
his
senses
could
doubt
if
this
be
so
said
my
opponent
we
must
bear
it
as
best
we
may
i
then
translated
for
him
as
well
as
i
could
the
noble
speech
of
hamlet
in
which
he
says
that
it
is
the
fear
lest
worse
evils
may
befall
us
after
death
which
alone
prevents
us
from
rushing
into
death
arms
nonsense
he
answered
no
man
was
ever
yet
stopped
from
cutting
his
throat
by
any
such
fears
as
your
poet
ascribes
to
him
and
your
poet
probably
knew
this
perfectly
well
if
a
man
cuts
his
throat
he
is
at
bay
and
thinks
of
nothing
but
escape
no
matter
whither
provided
he
can
shuffle
off
his
present
no
men
are
kept
at
their
posts
not
by
the
fear
that
if
they
quit
them
they
may
quit
a
for
a
fire
but
by
the
hope
that
if
they
hold
on
the
fire
may
burn
less
fiercely
respect
to
quote
your
poet
makes
calamity
of
so
long
a
life
is
the
consideration
that
though
calamity
may
live
long
the
sufferer
may
live
longer
still
on
this
seeing
that
there
was
little
probability
of
our
coming
to
an
agreement
i
let
the
argument
drop
and
my
opponent
presently
left
me
with
as
much
disapprobation
as
he
could
show
without
being
overtly
rude
chapter
xviii
birth
formulae
i
heard
what
follows
not
from
arowhena
but
from
nosnibor
and
some
of
the
gentlemen
who
occasionally
dined
at
the
house
they
told
me
that
the
erewhonians
believe
in
and
not
only
this
of
which
i
will
write
more
fully
in
the
next
chapter
but
they
believe
that
it
is
of
their
own
free
act
and
deed
in
a
previous
state
that
they
come
to
be
born
into
this
world
at
all
they
hold
that
the
unborn
are
perpetually
plaguing
and
tormenting
the
married
of
both
sexes
fluttering
about
them
incessantly
and
giving
them
no
peace
either
of
mind
or
body
until
they
have
consented
to
take
them
under
their
protection
if
this
were
not
so
this
at
least
is
what
they
urge
it
would
be
a
monstrous
freedom
for
one
man
to
take
with
another
to
say
that
he
should
undergo
the
chances
and
changes
of
this
mortal
life
without
any
option
in
the
matter
no
man
would
have
any
right
to
get
married
at
all
inasmuch
as
he
can
never
tell
what
frightful
misery
his
doing
so
may
entail
forcibly
upon
a
being
who
can
not
be
unhappy
as
long
as
he
does
not
exist
they
feel
this
so
strongly
that
they
are
resolved
to
shift
the
blame
on
to
other
shoulders
and
have
fashioned
a
long
mythology
as
to
the
world
in
which
the
unborn
people
live
and
what
they
do
and
the
arts
and
machinations
to
which
they
have
recourse
in
order
to
get
themselves
into
our
own
world
but
of
this
more
anon
what
i
would
relate
here
is
their
manner
of
dealing
with
those
who
do
come
it
is
a
distinguishing
peculiarity
of
the
erewhonians
that
when
they
profess
themselves
to
be
quite
certain
about
any
matter
and
avow
it
as
a
base
on
which
they
are
to
build
a
system
of
practice
they
seldom
quite
believe
in
it
if
they
smell
a
rat
about
the
precincts
of
a
cherished
institution
they
will
always
stop
their
noses
to
it
if
they
can
this
is
what
most
of
them
did
in
this
matter
of
the
unborn
for
i
can
not
and
never
could
think
that
they
seriously
believed
in
their
mythology
concerning
they
did
and
they
did
not
they
did
not
know
themselves
what
they
believed
all
they
did
know
was
that
it
was
a
disease
not
to
believe
as
they
did
the
only
thing
of
which
they
were
quite
sure
was
that
it
was
the
pestering
of
the
unborn
which
caused
them
to
be
brought
into
this
world
and
that
they
would
not
have
been
here
if
they
would
have
only
let
peaceable
people
alone
it
would
be
hard
to
disprove
this
position
and
they
might
have
a
good
case
if
they
would
only
leave
it
as
it
stands
but
this
they
will
not
do
they
must
have
assurance
doubly
sure
they
must
have
the
written
word
of
the
child
itself
as
soon
as
it
is
born
giving
the
parents
indemnity
from
all
responsibility
on
the
score
of
its
birth
and
asserting
its
own
they
have
therefore
devised
something
which
they
call
a
birth
formula
a
document
which
varies
in
words
according
to
the
caution
of
parents
but
is
much
the
same
practically
in
all
cases
for
it
has
been
the
business
of
the
erewhonian
lawyers
during
many
ages
to
exercise
their
skill
in
perfecting
it
and
providing
for
every
contingency
these
formulae
are
printed
on
common
paper
at
a
moderate
cost
for
the
poor
but
the
rich
have
them
written
on
parchment
and
handsomely
bound
so
that
the
getting
up
of
a
person
birth
formula
is
a
test
of
his
social
position
they
commence
by
setting
forth
that
whereas
a
was
a
member
of
the
kingdom
of
the
unborn
where
he
was
well
provided
for
in
every
way
and
had
no
cause
of
discontent
he
did
of
his
own
wanton
depravity
and
restlessness
conceive
a
desire
to
enter
into
this
present
world
that
thereon
having
taken
the
necessary
steps
as
set
forth
in
laws
of
the
unborn
kingdom
he
did
with
malice
aforethought
set
himself
to
plague
and
pester
two
unfortunate
people
who
had
never
wronged
him
and
who
were
quite
contented
and
happy
until
he
conceived
this
base
design
against
their
peace
for
which
wrong
he
now
humbly
entreats
their
pardon
he
acknowledges
that
he
is
responsible
for
all
physical
blemishes
and
deficiencies
which
may
render
him
answerable
to
the
laws
of
his
country
that
his
parents
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
any
of
these
things
and
that
they
have
a
right
to
kill
him
at
once
if
they
be
so
minded
though
he
entreats
them
to
show
their
marvellous
goodness
and
clemency
by
sparing
his
life
if
they
will
do
this
he
promises
to
be
their
most
obedient
and
abject
creature
during
his
earlier
years
and
indeed
all
his
life
unless
they
should
see
fit
in
their
abundant
generosity
to
remit
some
portion
of
his
service
hereafter
and
so
the
formula
continues
going
sometimes
into
very
minute
details
according
to
the
fancies
of
family
lawyers
who
will
not
make
it
any
shorter
than
they
can
help
the
deed
being
thus
prepared
on
the
third
or
fourth
day
after
the
birth
of
the
child
or
as
they
call
it
the
final
importunity
the
friends
gather
together
and
there
is
a
feast
held
where
they
are
all
very
melancholy
as
a
general
rule
i
believe
quite
truly
so
and
make
presents
to
the
father
and
mother
of
the
child
in
order
to
console
them
for
the
injury
which
has
just
been
done
them
by
the
unborn
the
child
himself
is
brought
down
by
his
nurse
and
the
company
begin
to
rail
upon
him
upbraiding
him
for
his
impertinence
and
asking
him
what
amends
he
proposes
to
make
for
the
wrong
that
he
has
committed
and
how
he
can
look
for
care
and
nourishment
from
those
who
have
perhaps
already
been
injured
by
the
unborn
on
some
ten
or
twelve
occasions
for
they
say
of
people
with
large
families
that
they
have
suffered
terrible
injuries
from
the
unborn
till
at
last
when
this
has
been
carried
far
enough
some
one
suggests
the
formula
which
is
brought
out
and
solemnly
read
to
the
child
by
the
family
straightener
this
gentleman
is
always
invited
on
these
occasions
for
the
very
fact
of
intrusion
into
a
peaceful
family
shows
a
depravity
on
the
part
of
the
child
which
requires
his
professional
services
on
being
teased
by
the
reading
and
tweaked
by
the
nurse
the
child
will
commonly
begin
to
cry
which
is
reckoned
a
good
sign
as
showing
a
consciousness
of
guilt
he
is
thereon
asked
does
he
assent
to
the
formula
on
which
as
he
still
continues
crying
and
can
obviously
make
no
answer
some
one
of
the
friends
comes
forward
and
undertakes
to
sign
the
document
on
his
behalf
feeling
sure
so
he
says
that
the
child
would
do
it
if
he
only
knew
how
and
that
he
will
release
the
present
signer
from
his
engagement
on
arriving
at
maturity
the
friend
then
inscribes
the
signature
of
the
child
at
the
foot
of
the
parchment
which
is
held
to
bind
the
child
as
much
as
though
he
had
signed
it
himself
even
this
however
does
not
fully
content
them
for
they
feel
a
little
uneasy
until
they
have
got
the
child
own
signature
after
all
so
when
he
is
about
fourteen
these
good
people
partly
bribe
him
by
promises
of
greater
liberty
and
good
things
and
partly
intimidate
him
through
their
great
power
of
making
themselves
actively
unpleasant
to
him
so
that
though
there
is
a
show
of
freedom
made
there
is
really
none
they
also
use
the
offices
of
the
teachers
in
the
colleges
of
unreason
till
at
last
in
one
way
or
another
they
take
very
good
care
that
he
shall
sign
the
paper
by
which
he
professes
to
have
been
a
free
agent
in
coming
into
the
world
and
to
take
all
the
responsibility
of
having
done
so
on
to
his
own
shoulders
and
yet
though
this
document
is
obviously
the
most
important
which
any
one
can
sign
in
his
whole
life
they
will
have
him
do
so
at
an
age
when
neither
they
nor
the
law
will
for
many
a
year
allow
any
one
else
to
bind
him
to
the
smallest
obligation
no
matter
how
righteously
he
may
owe
it
because
they
hold
him
too
young
to
know
what
he
is
about
and
do
not
consider
it
fair
that
he
should
commit
himself
to
anything
that
may
prejudice
him
in
after
years
i
own
that
all
this
seemed
rather
hard
and
not
of
a
piece
with
the
many
admirable
institutions
existing
among
them
i
once
ventured
to
say
a
part
of
what
i
thought
about
it
to
one
of
the
professors
of
unreason
i
did
it
very
tenderly
but
his
justification
of
the
system
was
quite
out
of
my
comprehension
i
remember
asking
him
whether
he
did
not
think
it
would
do
harm
to
a
lad
principles
by
weakening
his
sense
of
the
sanctity
of
his
word
and
of
truth
generally
that
he
should
be
led
into
entering
upon
a
solemn
declaration
as
to
the
truth
of
things
about
which
all
that
he
can
certainly
know
is
that
he
knows
nothing
whether
in
fact
the
teachers
who
so
led
him
or
who
taught
anything
as
a
certainty
of
which
they
were
themselves
uncertain
were
not
earning
their
living
by
impairing
the
of
their
pupils
a
delicate
organisation
mostly
and
by
vitiating
one
of
their
most
sacred
instincts
the
professor
who
was
a
delightful
person
seemed
greatly
surprised
at
the
view
which
i
took
but
it
had
no
influence
with
him
whatsoever
no
one
he
answered
expected
that
the
boy
either
would
or
could
know
all
that
he
said
he
knew
but
the
world
was
full
of
compromises
and
there
was
hardly
any
affirmation
which
would
bear
being
interpreted
literally
human
language
was
too
gross
a
vehicle
of
thought
thought
being
incapable
of
absolute
translation
he
added
that
as
there
can
be
no
translation
from
one
language
into
another
which
shall
not
scant
the
meaning
somewhat
or
enlarge
upon
it
so
there
is
no
language
which
can
render
thought
without
a
jarring
and
a
harshness
somewhere
and
so
forth
all
of
which
seemed
to
come
to
this
in
the
end
that
it
was
the
custom
of
the
country
and
that
the
erewhonians
were
a
conservative
people
that
the
boy
would
have
to
begin
compromising
sooner
or
later
and
this
was
part
of
his
education
in
the
art
it
was
perhaps
to
be
regretted
that
compromise
should
be
as
necessary
as
it
was
still
it
was
necessary
and
the
sooner
the
boy
got
to
understand
it
the
better
for
himself
but
they
never
tell
this
to
the
boy
from
the
book
of
their
mythology
about
the
unborn
i
made
the
extracts
which
will
form
the
following
chapter
chapter
xix
the
world
of
the
unborn
the
erewhonians
say
that
we
are
drawn
through
life
backwards
or
again
that
we
go
onwards
into
the
future
as
into
a
dark
corridor
time
walks
beside
us
and
flings
back
shutters
as
we
advance
but
the
light
thus
given
often
dazzles
us
and
deepens
the
darkness
which
is
in
front
we
can
see
but
little
at
a
time
and
heed
that
little
far
less
than
our
apprehension
of
what
we
shall
see
next
ever
peering
curiously
through
the
glare
of
the
present
into
the
gloom
of
the
future
we
presage
the
leading
lines
of
that
which
is
before
us
by
faintly
reflected
lights
from
dull
mirrors
that
are
behind
and
stumble
on
as
we
may
till
the
door
opens
beneath
us
and
we
are
gone
they
say
at
other
times
that
the
future
and
the
past
are
as
a
panorama
upon
two
rollers
that
which
is
on
the
roller
of
the
future
unwraps
itself
on
to
the
roller
of
the
past
we
can
not
hasten
it
and
we
may
not
stay
it
we
must
see
all
that
is
unfolded
to
us
whether
it
be
good
or
ill
and
what
we
have
seen
once
we
may
see
again
no
more
it
is
ever
unwinding
and
being
wound
we
catch
it
in
transition
for
a
moment
and
call
it
present
our
flustered
senses
gather
what
impression
they
can
and
we
guess
at
what
is
coming
by
the
tenor
of
that
which
we
have
seen
the
same
hand
has
painted
the
whole
picture
and
the
incidents
vary
little
rivers
woods
plains
mountains
towns
and
peoples
love
sorrow
and
death
yet
the
interest
never
flags
and
we
look
hopefully
for
some
good
fortune
or
fearfully
lest
our
own
faces
be
shown
us
as
figuring
in
something
terrible
when
the
scene
is
past
we
think
we
know
it
though
there
is
so
much
to
see
and
so
little
time
to
see
it
that
our
conceit
of
knowledge
as
regards
the
past
is
for
the
most
part
poorly
founded
neither
do
we
care
about
it
greatly
save
in
so
far
as
it
may
affect
the
future
wherein
our
interest
mainly
lies
the
erewhonians
say
it
was
by
chance
only
that
the
earth
and
stars
and
all
the
heavenly
worlds
began
to
roll
from
east
to
west
and
not
from
west
to
east
and
in
like
manner
they
say
it
is
by
chance
that
man
is
drawn
through
life
with
his
face
to
the
past
instead
of
to
the
future
for
the
future
is
there
as
much
as
the
past
only
that
we
may
not
see
it
is
it
not
in
the
loins
of
the
past
and
must
not
the
past
alter
before
the
future
can
do
so
sometimes
again
they
say
that
there
was
a
race
of
men
tried
upon
the
earth
once
who
knew
the
future
better
than
the
past
but
that
they
died
in
a
twelvemonth
from
the
misery
which
their
knowledge
caused
them
and
if
any
were
to
be
born
too
prescient
now
he
would
be
culled
out
by
natural
selection
before
he
had
time
to
transmit
so
a
faculty
to
his
descendants
strange
fate
for
man
he
must
perish
if
he
get
that
which
he
must
perish
if
he
strive
not
after
if
he
strive
not
after
it
he
is
no
better
than
the
brutes
if
he
get
it
he
is
more
miserable
than
the
devils
having
waded
through
many
chapters
like
the
above
i
came
at
last
to
the
unborn
themselves
and
found
that
they
were
held
to
be
souls
pure
and
simple
having
no
actual
bodies
but
living
in
a
sort
of
gaseous
yet
more
or
less
anthropomorphic
existence
like
that
of
a
ghost
they
have
thus
neither
flesh
nor
blood
nor
warmth
nevertheless
they
are
supposed
to
have
local
habitations
and
cities
wherein
they
dwell
though
these
are
as
unsubstantial
as
their
inhabitants
they
are
even
thought
to
eat
and
drink
some
thin
ambrosial
sustenance
and
generally
to
be
capable
of
doing
whatever
mankind
can
do
only
after
a
visionary
ghostly
fashion
as
in
a
dream
on
the
other
hand
as
long
as
they
remain
where
they
are
they
never
die
the
only
form
of
death
in
the
unborn
world
being
the
leaving
it
for
our
own
they
are
believed
to
be
extremely
numerous
far
more
so
than
mankind
they
arrive
from
unknown
planets
full
grown
in
large
batches
at
a
time
but
they
can
only
leave
the
unborn
world
by
taking
the
steps
necessary
for
their
arrival
here
which
is
in
fact
by
suicide
they
ought
to
be
an
exceedingly
happy
people
for
they
have
no
extremes
of
good
or
ill
fortune
never
marrying
but
living
in
a
state
much
like
that
fabled
by
the
poets
as
the
primitive
condition
of
mankind
in
spite
of
this
however
they
are
incessantly
complaining
they
know
that
we
in
this
world
have
bodies
and
indeed
they
know
everything
else
about
us
for
they
move
among
us
whithersoever
they
will
and
can
read
our
thoughts
as
well
as
survey
our
actions
at
pleasure
one
would
think
that
this
should
be
enough
for
them
and
most
of
them
are
indeed
alive
to
the
desperate
risk
which
they
will
run
by
indulging
themselves
in
that
body
with
sensible
warm
motion
which
they
so
much
desire
nevertheless
there
are
some
to
whom
the
of
a
disembodied
existence
is
so
intolerable
that
they
will
venture
anything
for
a
change
so
they
resolve
to
quit
the
conditions
which
they
must
accept
are
so
uncertain
that
none
but
the
most
foolish
of
the
unborn
will
consent
to
them
and
it
is
from
these
and
these
only
that
our
own
ranks
are
recruited
when
they
have
finally
made
up
their
minds
to
leave
they
must
go
before
the
magistrate
of
the
nearest
town
and
sign
an
affidavit
of
their
desire
to
quit
their
then
existence
on
their
having
done
this
the
magistrate
reads
them
the
conditions
which
they
must
accept
and
which
are
so
long
that
i
can
only
extract
some
of
the
principal
points
which
are
mainly
the
following
first
they
must
take
a
potion
which
will
destroy
their
memory
and
sense
of
identity
they
must
go
into
the
world
helpless
and
without
a
will
of
their
own
they
must
draw
lots
for
their
dispositions
before
they
go
and
take
them
such
as
they
are
for
better
or
worse
neither
are
they
to
be
allowed
any
choice
in
the
matter
of
the
body
which
they
so
much
desire
they
are
simply
allotted
by
chance
and
without
appeal
to
two
people
whom
it
is
their
business
to
find
and
pester
until
they
adopt
them
who
these
are
to
be
whether
rich
or
poor
kind
or
unkind
healthy
or
diseased
there
is
no
knowing
they
have
in
fact
to
entrust
themselves
for
many
years
to
the
care
of
those
for
whose
good
constitution
and
good
sense
they
have
no
sort
of
guarantee
it
is
curious
to
read
the
lectures
which
the
wiser
heads
give
to
those
who
are
meditating
a
change
they
talk
with
them
as
we
talk
with
a
spendthrift
and
with
about
as
much
success
to
be
born
they
say
is
a
felony
it
is
a
capital
crime
for
which
sentence
may
be
executed
at
any
moment
after
the
commission
of
the
offence
you
may
perhaps
happen
to
live
for
some
seventy
or
eighty
years
but
what
is
that
compared
with
the
eternity
you
now
enjoy
and
even
though
the
sentence
were
commuted
and
you
were
allowed
to
live
on
for
ever
you
would
in
time
become
so
terribly
weary
of
life
that
execution
would
be
the
greatest
mercy
to
you
consider
the
infinite
risk
to
be
born
of
wicked
parents
and
trained
in
vice
to
be
born
of
silly
parents
and
trained
to
unrealities
of
parents
who
regard
you
as
a
sort
of
chattel
or
property
belonging
more
to
them
than
to
yourself
again
you
may
draw
utterly
unsympathetic
parents
who
will
never
be
able
to
understand
you
and
who
will
do
their
best
to
thwart
you
as
a
hen
when
she
has
hatched
a
duckling
and
then
call
you
ungrateful
because
you
do
not
love
them
or
again
you
may
draw
parents
who
look
upon
you
as
a
thing
to
be
cowed
while
it
is
still
young
lest
it
should
give
them
trouble
hereafter
by
having
wishes
and
feelings
of
its
own
in
later
life
when
you
have
been
finally
allowed
to
pass
muster
as
a
full
member
of
the
world
you
will
yourself
become
liable
to
the
pesterings
of
the
unborn
and
a
very
happy
life
you
may
be
led
in
consequence
for
we
solicit
so
strongly
that
a
few
only
nor
these
the
best
can
refuse
us
and
yet
not
to
refuse
is
much
the
same
as
going
into
partnership
with
different
people
about
whom
one
can
know
absolutely
nothing
beforehand
not
even
whether
one
is
going
into
partnership
with
men
or
women
nor
with
how
many
of
either
delude
not
yourself
with
thinking
that
you
will
be
wiser
than
your
parents
you
may
be
an
age
in
advance
of
those
whom
you
have
pestered
but
unless
you
are
one
of
the
great
ones
you
will
still
be
an
age
behind
those
who
will
in
their
turn
pester
you
imagine
what
it
must
be
to
have
an
unborn
quartered
upon
you
who
is
of
an
entirely
different
temperament
and
disposition
to
your
own
nay
such
who
will
not
love
you
though
you
have
stinted
yourself
in
a
thousand
ways
to
provide
for
their
comfort
and
who
will
forget
all
your
and
of
whom
you
may
never
be
sure
that
they
are
not
bearing
a
grudge
against
you
for
errors
of
judgement
into
which
you
may
have
fallen
though
you
had
hoped
that
such
had
been
long
since
atoned
for
ingratitude
such
as
this
is
not
uncommon
yet
fancy
what
it
must
be
to
bear
it
is
hard
upon
the
duckling
to
have
been
hatched
by
a
hen
but
is
it
not
also
hard
upon
the
hen
to
have
hatched
the
duckling
consider
it
again
we
pray
you
not
for
our
sake
but
for
your
own
your
initial
character
you
must
draw
by
lot
but
whatever
it
is
it
can
only
come
to
a
tolerably
successful
development
after
long
training
remember
that
over
that
training
you
will
have
no
control
it
is
possible
and
even
probable
that
whatever
you
may
get
in
after
life
which
is
of
real
pleasure
and
service
to
you
will
have
to
be
won
in
spite
of
rather
than
by
the
help
of
those
whom
you
are
now
about
to
pester
and
that
you
will
only
win
your
freedom
after
years
of
a
painful
struggle
in
which
it
will
be
hard
to
say
whether
you
have
suffered
most
injury
or
inflicted
it
remember
also
that
if
you
go
into
the
world
you
will
have
free
will
that
you
will
be
obliged
to
have
it
that
there
is
no
escaping
it
that
you
will
be
fettered
to
it
during
your
whole

and
must
on

do
that
which
on
the

you

no

whether
you

in

will
be

and
your

will
go
with
the
heavier
scale
how
it
shall
fall
will
depend
upon
the
kind
of
scales
which
you
may
have
drawn
at
birth
the
bias
which
they
will
have
obtained
by
use
and
the
weight
of
the
immediate
considerations
if
the
scales
were
good
to
start
with
and
if
they
have
not
been
outrageously
tampered
with
in
childhood
and
if
the
combinations
into
which
you
enter
are
average
ones
you
may
come
off
well
but
there
are
too
many
in
this
and
with
the
failure
of
any
one
of
them
your
misery
is
assured
reflect
on
this
and
remember
that
should
the
ill
come
upon
you
you
will
have
yourself
to
thank
for
it
is
your
own
choice
to
be
born
and
there
is
no
compulsion
in
the
matter
not
that
we
deny
the
existence
of
pleasures
among
mankind
there
is
a
certain
show
of
sundry
phases
of
contentment
which
may
even
amount
to
very
considerable
happiness
but
mark
how
they
are
distributed
over
a
man
life
belonging
all
the
keenest
of
them
to
the
fore
part
and
few
indeed
to
the
after
can
there
be
any
pleasure
worth
purchasing
with
the
miseries
of
a
decrepit
age
if
you
are
good
strong
and
handsome
you
have
a
fine
fortune
indeed
at
twenty
but
how
much
of
it
will
be
left
at
sixty
for
you
must
live
on
your
capital
there
is
no
investing
your
powers
so
that
you
may
get
a
small
annuity
of
life
for
ever
you
must
eat
up
your
principal
bit
by
bit
and
be
tortured
by
seeing
it
grow
continually
smaller
and
smaller
even
though
you
happen
to
escape
being
rudely
robbed
of
it
by
crime
or
casualty
remember
too
that
there
never
yet
was
a
man
of
forty
who
would
not
come
back
into
the
world
of
the
unborn
if
he
could
do
so
with
decency
and
honour
being
in
the
world
he
will
as
a
general
rule
stay
till
he
is
forced
to
go
but
do
you
think
that
he
would
consent
to
be
born
again
and
his
life
if
he
had
the
offer
of
doing
so
do
not
think
it
if
he
could
so
alter
the
past
as
that
he
should
never
have
come
into
being
at
all
do
you
not
think
that
he
would
do
it
very
gladly
what
was
it
that
one
of
their
own
poets
meant
if
it
was
not
this
when
he
cried
out
upon
the
day
in
which
he
was
born
and
the
night
in
which
it
was
said
there
is
a
man
child
conceived
now
he
says
should
have
lain
still
and
been
quiet
i
should
have
slept
then
had
i
been
at
rest
with
kings
and
counsellors
of
the
earth
which
built
desolate
places
for
themselves
or
with
princes
that
had
gold
who
filled
their
houses
with
silver
or
as
an
hidden
untimely
birth
i
had
not
been
as
infants
which
never
saw
light
there
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
be
very
sure
that
the
guilt
of
being
born
carries
this
punishment
at
times
to
all
men
but
how
can
they
ask
for
pity
or
complain
of
any
mischief
that
may
befall
them
having
entered
into
the
snare
one
word
more
and
we
have
done
if
any
faint
remembrance
as
of
a
dream
flit
in
some
puzzled
moment
across
your
brain
and
you
shall
feel
that
the
potion
which
is
to
be
given
you
shall
not
have
done
its
work
and
the
memory
of
this
existence
which
you
are
leaving
endeavours
vainly
to
return
we
say
in
such
a
moment
when
you
clutch
at
the
dream
but
it
eludes
your
grasp
and
you
watch
it
as
orpheus
watched
eurydice
gliding
back
again
into
the
twilight
kingdom
fly
fly
if
you
can
remember
the
advice
to
the
haven
of
your
present
and
immediate
duty
taking
shelter
incessantly
in
the
work
which
you
have
in
hand
this
much
you
may
perhaps
recall
and
this
if
you
will
imprint
it
deeply
upon
your
every
faculty
will
be
most
likely
to
bring
you
safely
and
honourably
home
through
the
trials
that
are
before
you
this
is
the
fashion
in
which
they
reason
with
those
who
would
be
for
leaving
them
but
it
is
seldom
that
they
do
much
good
for
none
but
the
unquiet
and
unreasonable
ever
think
of
being
born
and
those
who
are
foolish
enough
to
think
of
it
are
generally
foolish
enough
to
do
it
finding
therefore
that
they
can
do
no
more
the
friends
follow
weeping
to
the
courthouse
of
the
chief
magistrate
where
the
one
who
wishes
to
be
born
declares
solemnly
and
openly
that
he
accepts
the
conditions
attached
to
his
decision
on
this
he
is
presented
with
a
potion
which
immediately
destroys
his
memory
and
sense
of
identity
and
dissipates
the
thin
gaseous
tenement
which
he
has
inhabited
he
becomes
a
bare
vital
principle
not
to
be
perceived
by
human
senses
nor
to
be
by
any
chemical
test
appreciated
he
has
but
one
instinct
which
is
that
he
is
to
go
to
such
and
such
a
place
where
he
will
find
two
persons
whom
he
is
to
importune
till
they
consent
to
undertake
him
but
whether
he
is
to
find
these
persons
among
the
race
of
chowbok
or
the
erewhonians
themselves
is
not
for
him
to
choose
chapter
xx
what
they
mean
by
it
i
have
given
the
above
mythology
at
some
length
but
it
is
only
a
small
part
of
what
they
have
upon
the
subject
my
first
feeling
on
reading
it
was
that
any
amount
of
folly
on
the
part
of
the
unborn
in
coming
here
was
justified
by
a
desire
to
escape
from
such
intolerable
prosing
the
mythology
is
obviously
an
unfair
and
exaggerated
representation
of
life
and
things
and
had
its
authors
been
so
minded
they
could
have
easily
drawn
a
picture
which
would
err
as
much
on
the
bright
side
as
this
does
on
the
dark
no
erewhonian
believes
that
the
world
is
as
black
as
it
has
been
here
painted
but
it
is
one
of
their
peculiarities
that
they
very
often
do
not
believe
or
mean
things
which
they
profess
to
regard
as
indisputable
in
the
present
instance
their
professed
views
concerning
the
unborn
have
arisen
from
their
desire
to
prove
that
people
have
been
presented
with
the
gloomiest
possible
picture
of
their
own
prospects
before
they
came
here
otherwise
they
could
hardly
say
to
one
whom
they
are
going
to
punish
for
an
affection
of
the
heart
or
brain
that
it
is
all
his
own
doing
in
practice
they
modify
their
theory
to
a
considerable
extent
and
seldom
refer
to
the
birth
formula
except
in
extreme
cases
for
the
force
of
habit
or
what
not
gives
many
of
them
a
kindly
interest
even
in
creatures
who
have
so
much
wronged
them
as
the
unborn
have
done
and
though
a
man
generally
hates
the
unwelcome
little
stranger
for
the
first
twelve
months
he
is
apt
to
mollify
according
to
his
lights
as
time
goes
on
and
sometimes
he
will
become
inordinately
attached
to
the
beings
whom
he
is
pleased
to
call
his
children
of
course
according
to
erewhonian
premises
it
would
serve
people
right
to
be
punished
and
scouted
for
moral
and
intellectual
diseases
as
much
as
for
physical
and
i
can
not
to
this
day
understand
why
they
should
have
stopped
short
half
way
neither
again
can
i
understand
why
their
having
done
so
should
have
been
as
it
certainly
was
a
matter
of
so
much
concern
to
myself
what
could
it
matter
to
me
how
many
absurdities
the
erewhonians
might
adopt
nevertheless
i
longed
to
make
them
think
as
i
did
for
the
wish
to
spread
those
opinions
that
we
hold
conducive
to
our
own
welfare
is
so
deeply
rooted
in
the
english
character
that
few
of
us
can
escape
its
influence
but
let
this
pass
in
spite
of
not
a
few
modifications
in
practice
of
a
theory
which
is
itself
revolting
the
relations
between
children
and
parents
in
that
country
are
less
happy
than
in
europe
it
was
rarely
that
i
saw
cases
of
real
hearty
and
intense
affection
between
the
old
people
and
the
young
ones
here
and
there
i
did
so
and
was
quite
sure
that
the
children
even
at
the
age
of
twenty
were
fonder
of
their
parents
than
they
were
of
any
one
else
and
that
of
their
own
inclination
being
free
to
choose
what
company
they
would
they
would
often
choose
that
of
their
father
and
mother
the
straightener
carriage
was
rarely
seen
at
the
door
of
those
houses
i
saw
two
or
three
such
cases
during
the
time
that
i
remained
in
the
country
and
can
not
express
the
pleasure
which
i
derived
from
a
sight
suggestive
of
so
much
goodness
and
wisdom
and
forbearance
so
richly
rewarded
yet
i
firmly
believe
that
the
same
thing
would
happen
in
nine
families
out
of
ten
if
the
parents
were
merely
to
remember
how
they
felt
when
they
were
young
and
actually
to
behave
towards
their
children
as
they
would
have
had
their
own
parents
behave
towards
themselves
but
this
which
would
appear
to
be
so
simple
and
obvious
seems
also
to
be
a
thing
which
not
one
in
a
hundred
thousand
is
able
to
put
in
practice
it
is
only
the
very
great
and
good
who
have
any
living
faith
in
the
simplest
axioms
and
there
are
few
who
are
so
holy
as
to
feel
that
and
make
as
certainly
as
and
make
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
this
narrative
should
ever
fall
into
erewhonian
hands
it
will
be
said
that
what
i
have
written
about
the
relations
between
parents
and
children
being
seldom
satisfactory
is
an
infamous
perversion
of
facts
and
that
in
truth
there
are
few
young
people
who
do
not
feel
happier
in
the
society
of
their
nearest
relations
than
in
any
other
nosnibor
would
be
sure
to
say
this
yet
i
can
not
refrain
from
expressing
an
opinion
that
he
would
be
a
good
deal
embarrassed
if
his
deceased
parents
were
to
reappear
and
propose
to
pay
him
a
six
months
visit
i
doubt
whether
there
are
many
things
which
he
would
regard
as
a
greater
infliction
they
had
died
at
a
ripe
old
age
some
twenty
years
before
i
came
to
know
him
so
the
case
is
an
extreme
one
but
surely
if
they
had
treated
him
with
what
in
his
youth
he
had
felt
to
be
true
unselfishness
his
face
would
brighten
when
he
thought
of
them
to
the
end
of
his
life
in
the
one
or
two
cases
of
true
family
affection
which
i
met
with
i
am
sure
that
the
young
people
who
were
so
genuinely
fond
of
their
fathers
and
mothers
at
eighteen
would
at
sixty
be
perfectly
delighted
were
they
to
get
the
chance
of
welcoming
them
as
their
guests
there
is
nothing
which
could
please
them
better
except
perhaps
to
watch
the
happiness
of
their
own
children
and
grandchildren
this
is
how
things
should
be
it
is
not
an
impossible
ideal
it
is
one
which
actually
does
exist
in
some
few
cases
and
might
exist
in
almost
all
with
a
little
more
patience
and
forbearance
upon
the
parents
part
but
it
is
rare
at
present
so
rare
that
they
have
a
proverb
which
i
can
only
translate
in
a
very
roundabout
way
but
which
says
that
the
great
happiness
of
some
people
in
a
future
state
will
consist
in
watching
the
distress
of
their
parents
on
returning
to
eternal
companionship
with
their
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
whilst
compulsory
affection
is
the
idea
which
lies
at
the
root
of
their
word
for
the
deepest
anguish
there
is
no
talisman
in
the
word
parent
which
can
generate
miracles
of
affection
and
i
can
well
believe
that
my
own
child
might
find
it
less
of
a
calamity
to
lose
both
arowhena
and
myself
when
he
is
six
years
old
than
to
find
us
again
when
he
is
sixty
a
sentence
which
i
would
not
pen
did
i
not
feel
that
by
doing
so
i
was
giving
him
something
like
a
hostage
or
at
any
rate
putting
a
weapon
into
his
hands
against
me
should
my
selfishness
exceed
reasonable
limits
money
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
to
a
great
extent
if
the
parents
would
put
their
children
in
the
way
of
earning
a
competence
earlier
than
they
do
the
children
would
soon
become
and
independent
as
it
is
under
the
present
system
the
young
ones
get
old
enough
to
have
all
manner
of
legitimate
wants
that
is
if
they
have
any
go
about
them
before
they
have
learnt
the
means
of
earning
money
to
pay
for
them
hence
they
must
either
do
without
them
or
take
more
money
than
the
parents
can
be
expected
to
spare
this
is
due
chiefly
to
the
schools
of
unreason
where
a
boy
is
taught
upon
hypothetical
principles
as
i
will
explain
hereafter
spending
years
in
being
incapacitated
for
doing
this
that
or
the
other
he
hardly
knows
what
during
all
which
time
he
ought
to
have
been
actually
doing
the
thing
itself
beginning
at
the
lowest
grades
picking
it
up
through
actual
practice
and
rising
according
to
the
energy
which
is
in
him
these
schools
of
unreason
surprised
me
much
it
would
be
easy
to
fall
into
and
i
would
fain
believe
that
the
system
may
be
good
for
the
children
of
very
rich
parents
or
for
those
who
show
a
natural
instinct
to
acquire
hypothetical
lore
but
the
misery
was
that
their
required
all
people
with
any
pretence
to
respectability
to
send
their
children
to
some
one
or
other
of
these
schools
mulcting
them
of
years
of
money
it
astonished
me
to
see
what
sacrifices
the
parents
would
make
in
order
to
render
their
children
as
nearly
useless
as
possible
and
it
was
hard
to
say
whether
the
old
suffered
most
from
the
expense
which
they
were
thus
put
to
or
the
young
from
being
deliberately
swindled
in
some
of
the
most
important
branches
of
human
inquiry
and
directed
into
false
channels
or
left
to
drift
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
i
can
not
think
i
am
mistaken
in
believing
that
the
growing
tendency
to
limit
families
by
infanticide
an
evil
which
was
causing
general
alarm
throughout
the
country
was
almost
entirely
due
to
the
way
in
which
education
had
become
a
fetish
from
one
end
of
erewhon
to
the
other
granted
that
provision
should
be
made
whereby
every
child
should
be
taught
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
but
here
compulsory
education
should
end
and
the
child
should
begin
with
all
due
precautions
to
ensure
that
he
is
not
overworked
to
acquire
the
rudiments
of
that
art
whereby
he
is
to
earn
his
living
he
can
not
acquire
these
in
what
we
in
england
call
schools
of
technical
education
such
schools
are
cloister
life
as
against
the
rough
and
tumble
of
the
world
they
unfit
rather
than
fit
for
work
in
the
open
an
art
can
only
be
learned
in
the
workshop
of
those
who
are
winning
their
bread
by
it
boys
as
a
rule
hate
the
artificial
and
delight
in
the
actual
give
them
the
chance
of
earning
and
they
will
soon
earn
when
parents
find
that
their
children
instead
of
being
made
artificially
burdensome
will
early
begin
to
contribute
to
the
of
the
family
they
will
soon
leave
off
killing
them
and
will
seek
to
have
that
plenitude
of
offspring
which
they
now
avoid
as
things
are
the
state
lays
greater
burdens
on
parents
than
flesh
and
blood
can
bear
and
then
wrings
its
hands
over
an
evil
for
which
it
is
itself
mainly
responsible
with
the
less
classes
the
harm
was
not
so
great
for
among
these
at
about
ten
years
old
the
child
has
to
begin
doing
something
if
he
is
capable
he
makes
his
way
up
if
he
is
not
he
is
at
any
rate
not
made
more
incapable
by
what
his
friends
are
pleased
to
call
his
education
people
find
their
level
as
a
rule
and
though
they
unfortunately
sometimes
miss
it
it
is
in
the
main
true
that
those
who
have
valuable
qualities
are
perceived
to
have
them
and
can
sell
them
i
think
that
the
erewhonians
are
beginning
to
become
aware
of
these
things
for
there
was
much
talk
about
putting
a
tax
upon
all
parents
whose
children
were
not
earning
a
competence
according
to
their
degrees
by
the
time
they
were
twenty
years
old
i
am
sure
that
if
they
will
have
the
courage
to
carry
it
through
they
will
never
regret
it
for
the
parents
will
take
care
that
the
children
shall
begin
earning
money
which
means
doing
good
to
society
at
an
early
age
then
the
children
will
be
independent
early
and
they
will
not
press
on
the
parents
nor
the
parents
on
them
and
they
will
like
each
other
better
than
they
do
now
this
is
the
true
philanthropy
he
who
makes
a
colossal
fortune
in
the
hosiery
trade
and
by
his
energy
has
succeeded
in
reducing
the
price
of
woollen
goods
by
the
thousandth
part
of
a
penny
in
the
pound
this
man
is
worth
ten
professional
philanthropists
so
strongly
are
the
erewhonians
impressed
with
this
that
if
a
man
has
made
a
fortune
of
over
pounds
a
year
they
exempt
him
from
all
taxation
considering
him
as
a
work
of
art
and
too
precious
to
be
meddled
with
they
say
how
very
much
he
must
have
done
for
society
before
society
could
have
been
prevailed
upon
to
give
him
so
much
money
so
magnificent
an
organisation
overawes
them
they
regard
it
as
a
thing
dropped
from
heaven
money
they
say
is
the
symbol
of
duty
it
is
the
sacrament
of
having
done
for
mankind
that
which
mankind
wanted
mankind
may
not
be
a
very
good
judge
but
there
is
no
better
this
used
to
shock
me
at
first
when
i
remembered
that
it
had
been
said
on
high
authority
that
they
who
have
riches
shall
enter
hardly
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
the
influence
of
erewhon
had
made
me
begin
to
see
things
in
a
new
light
and
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
they
who
have
not
riches
shall
enter
more
hardly
still
people
oppose
money
to
culture
and
imply
that
if
a
man
has
spent
his
time
in
making
money
he
will
not
be
cultivated
fallacy
of
fallacies
as
though
there
could
be
a
greater
aid
to
culture
than
the
having
earned
an
honourable
independence
and
as
though
any
amount
of
culture
will
do
much
for
the
man
who
is
penniless
except
make
him
feel
his
position
more
deeply
the
young
man
who
was
told
to
sell
all
his
goods
and
give
to
the
poor
must
have
been
an
entirely
exceptional
person
if
the
advice
was
given
wisely
either
for
him
or
for
the
poor
how
much
more
often
does
it
happen
that
we
perceive
a
man
to
have
all
sorts
of
good
qualities
except
money
and
feel
that
his
real
duty
lies
in
getting
every
that
he
can
persuade
others
to
pay
him
for
his
services
and
becoming
rich
it
has
been
said
that
the
love
of
money
is
the
root
of
all
evil
the
want
of
money
is
so
quite
as
truly
the
above
may
sound
irreverent
but
it
is
conceived
in
a
spirit
of
the
most
utter
reverence
for
those
things
which
do
alone
deserve
it
that
is
for
the
things
which
are
which
mould
us
and
fashion
us
be
they
what
they
may
for
the
things
that
have
power
to
punish
us
and
which
will
punish
us
if
we
do
not
heed
them
for
our
masters
therefore
but
i
am
drifting
away
from
my
story
they
have
another
plan
about
which
they
are
making
a
great
noise
and
fuss
much
as
some
are
doing
with
women
rights
in
england
a
party
of
extreme
radicals
have
professed
themselves
unable
to
decide
upon
the
superiority
of
age
or
youth
at
present
all
goes
on
the
supposition
that
it
is
desirable
to
make
the
young
old
as
soon
as
possible
some
would
have
it
that
this
is
wrong
and
that
the
object
of
education
should
be
to
keep
the
old
young
as
long
as
possible
they
say
that
each
age
should
take
it
turn
in
turn
about
week
by
week
one
week
the
old
to
be
topsawyers
and
the
other
the
young
drawing
the
line
at
years
of
age
but
they
insist
that
the
young
should
be
allowed
to
inflict
corporal
chastisement
on
the
old
without
which
the
old
would
be
quite
incorrigible
in
any
european
country
this
would
be
out
of
the
question
but
it
is
not
so
there
for
the
straighteners
are
constantly
ordering
people
to
be
flogged
so
that
they
are
familiar
with
the
notion
i
do
not
suppose
that
the
idea
will
be
ever
acted
upon
but
its
having
been
even
mooted
is
enough
to
show
the
utter
perversion
of
the
erewhonian
mind
chapter
xxi
the
colleges
of
unreason
i
had
now
been
a
visitor
with
the
nosnibors
for
some
five
or
six
months
and
though
i
had
frequently
proposed
to
leave
them
and
take
apartments
of
my
own
they
would
not
hear
of
my
doing
so
i
suppose
they
thought
i
should
be
more
likely
to
fall
in
love
with
zulora
if
i
remained
but
it
was
my
affection
for
arowhena
that
kept
me
during
all
this
time
both
arowhena
and
myself
had
been
dreaming
and
drifting
towards
an
avowed
attachment
but
had
not
dared
to
face
the
real
difficulties
of
the
position
gradually
however
matters
came
to
a
crisis
in
spite
of
ourselves
and
we
got
to
see
the
true
state
of
the
case
all
too
clearly
one
evening
we
were
sitting
in
the
garden
and
i
had
been
trying
in
every
stupid
roundabout
way
to
get
her
to
say
that
she
should
be
at
any
rate
sorry
for
a
man
if
he
really
loved
a
woman
who
would
not
marry
him
i
had
been
stammering
and
blushing
and
been
as
silly
as
any
one
could
be
and
i
suppose
had
pained
her
by
fishing
for
pity
for
myself
in
such
a
transparent
way
and
saying
nothing
about
her
own
need
of
it
at
any
rate
she
turned
all
upon
me
with
a
sweet
sad
smile
and
said
sorry
i
am
sorry
for
myself
i
am
sorry
for
you
and
i
am
sorry
for
every
one
the
words
had
no
sooner
crossed
her
lips
than
she
bowed
her
head
gave
me
a
look
as
though
i
were
to
make
no
answer
and
left
me
the
words
were
few
and
simple
but
the
manner
with
which
they
were
uttered
was
ineffable
the
scales
fell
from
my
eyes
and
i
felt
that
i
had
no
right
to
try
and
induce
her
to
infringe
one
of
the
most
inviolable
customs
of
her
country
as
she
needs
must
do
if
she
were
to
marry
me
i
sat
for
a
long
while
thinking
and
when
i
remembered
the
sin
and
shame
and
misery
which
an
unrighteous
marriage
for
as
such
it
would
be
held
in
erewhon
would
entail
i
became
thoroughly
ashamed
of
myself
for
having
been
so
long
i
write
coldly
now
but
i
suffered
keenly
at
the
time
and
should
probably
retain
a
much
more
vivid
recollection
of
what
i
felt
had
not
all
ended
so
happily
as
for
giving
up
the
idea
of
marrying
arowhena
it
never
so
much
as
entered
my
head
to
do
so
the
solution
must
be
found
in
some
other
direction
than
this
the
idea
of
waiting
till
somebody
married
zulora
was
to
be
no
less
summarily
dismissed
to
marry
arowhena
at
once
in
erewhon
this
had
already
been
abandoned
there
remained
therefore
but
one
alternative
and
that
was
to
run
away
with
her
and
get
her
with
me
to
europe
where
there
would
be
no
bar
to
our
union
save
my
own
impecuniosity
a
matter
which
gave
me
no
uneasiness
to
this
obvious
and
simple
plan
i
could
see
but
two
objections
that
deserved
the
name
the
first
that
perhaps
arowhena
would
not
come
the
second
that
it
was
almost
impossible
for
me
to
escape
even
alone
for
the
king
had
himself
told
me
that
i
was
to
consider
myself
a
prisoner
on
parole
and
that
the
first
sign
of
my
endeavouring
to
escape
would
cause
me
to
be
sent
to
one
of
the
hospitals
for
incurables
besides
i
did
not
know
the
geography
of
the
country
and
even
were
i
to
try
and
find
my
way
back
i
should
be
discovered
long
before
i
had
reached
the
pass
over
which
i
had
come
how
then
could
i
hope
to
be
able
to
take
arowhena
with
me
for
days
and
days
i
turned
these
difficulties
over
in
my
mind
and
at
last
hit
upon
as
wild
a
plan
as
was
ever
suggested
by
extremity
this
was
to
meet
the
second
difficulty
the
first
gave
me
less
uneasiness
for
when
arowhena
and
i
next
met
after
our
interview
in
the
garden
i
could
see
that
she
had
suffered
not
less
acutely
than
myself
i
resolved
that
i
would
have
another
interview
with
her
the
last
for
the
present
that
i
would
then
leave
her
and
set
to
work
upon
maturing
my
plan
as
fast
as
possible
we
got
a
chance
of
being
alone
together
and
then
i
gave
myself
the
loose
rein
and
told
her
how
passionately
and
devotedly
i
loved
her
she
said
little
in
return
but
her
tears
which
i
could
not
refrain
from
answering
with
my
own
and
the
little
she
did
say
were
quite
enough
to
show
me
that
i
should
meet
with
no
obstacle
from
her
then
i
asked
her
whether
she
would
run
a
terrible
risk
which
we
should
share
in
common
if
in
case
of
success
i
could
take
her
to
my
own
people
to
the
home
of
my
mother
and
sisters
who
would
welcome
her
very
gladly
at
the
same
time
i
pointed
out
that
the
chances
of
failure
were
far
greater
than
those
of
success
and
that
the
probability
was
that
even
though
i
could
get
so
far
as
to
carry
my
design
into
execution
it
would
end
in
death
to
us
both
i
was
not
mistaken
in
her
she
said
that
she
believed
i
loved
her
as
much
as
she
loved
me
and
that
she
would
brave
anything
if
i
could
only
assure
her
that
what
i
proposed
would
not
be
thought
dishonourable
in
england
she
could
not
live
without
me
and
would
rather
die
with
me
than
alone
that
death
was
perhaps
the
best
for
us
both
that
i
must
plan
and
that
when
the
hour
came
i
was
to
send
for
her
and
trust
her
not
to
fail
me
and
so
after
many
tears
and
embraces
we
tore
ourselves
away
i
then
left
the
nosnibors
took
a
lodging
in
the
town
and
became
melancholy
to
my
heart
content
arowhena
and
i
used
to
see
each
other
sometimes
for
i
had
taken
to
going
regularly
to
the
musical
banks
but
nosnibor
and
zulora
both
treated
me
with
considerable
coldness
i
felt
sure
that
they
suspected
me
arowhena
looked
miserable
and
i
saw
that
her
purse
was
now
always
as
full
as
she
could
fill
it
with
the
musical
bank
money
much
fuller
than
of
old
then
the
horrible
thought
occurred
to
me
that
her
health
might
break
down
and
that
she
might
be
subjected
to
a
criminal
prosecution
oh
how
i
hated
erewhon
at
that
time
i
was
still
received
at
court
but
my
good
looks
were
beginning
to
fail
me
and
i
was
not
such
an
adept
at
concealing
the
effects
of
pain
as
the
erewhonians
are
i
could
see
that
my
friends
began
to
look
concerned
about
me
and
was
obliged
to
take
a
leaf
out
of
mahaina
book
and
pretend
to
have
developed
a
taste
for
drinking
i
even
consulted
a
straightener
as
though
this
were
so
and
submitted
to
much
discomfort
this
made
matters
better
for
a
time
but
i
could
see
that
my
friends
thought
less
highly
of
my
constitution
as
my
flesh
began
to
fall
away
i
was
told
that
the
poor
made
an
outcry
about
my
pension
and
i
saw
a
stinging
article
in
an
paper
in
which
the
writer
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
my
having
light
hair
reflected
little
credit
upon
me
inasmuch
as
i
had
been
reported
to
have
said
that
it
was
a
common
thing
in
the
country
from
which
i
came
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
nosnibor
himself
inspired
this
article
presently
it
came
round
to
me
that
the
king
had
begun
to
dwell
upon
my
having
been
possessed
of
a
watch
and
to
say
that
i
ought
to
be
treated
medicinally
for
having
told
him
a
lie
about
the
balloons
i
saw
misfortune
gathering
round
me
in
every
direction
and
felt
that
i
should
have
need
of
all
my
wits
and
a
good
many
more
if
i
was
to
steer
myself
and
arowhena
to
a
good
conclusion
there
were
some
who
continued
to
show
me
kindness
and
strange
to
say
i
received
the
most
from
the
very
persons
from
whom
i
should
have
least
expected
it
i
mean
from
the
cashiers
of
the
musical
banks
i
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
several
of
these
persons
and
now
that
i
frequented
their
bank
they
were
inclined
to
make
a
good
deal
of
me
one
of
them
seeing
that
i
was
thoroughly
out
of
health
though
of
course
he
pretended
not
to
notice
it
suggested
that
i
should
take
a
little
change
of
air
and
go
down
with
him
to
one
of
the
principal
towns
which
was
some
two
or
three
days
journey
from
the
metropolis
and
the
chief
seat
of
the
colleges
of
unreason
he
assured
me
that
i
should
be
delighted
with
what
i
saw
and
that
i
should
receive
a
most
hospitable
welcome
i
determined
therefore
to
accept
the
invitation
we
started
two
or
three
days
later
and
after
a
night
on
the
road
we
arrived
at
our
destination
towards
evening
it
was
now
full
spring
and
as
nearly
as
might
be
ten
months
since
i
had
started
with
chowbok
on
my
expedition
but
it
seemed
more
like
ten
years
the
trees
were
in
their
freshest
beauty
and
the
air
had
become
warm
without
being
oppressively
hot
after
having
lived
so
many
months
in
the
metropolis
the
sight
of
the
country
and
the
country
villages
through
which
we
passed
refreshed
me
greatly
but
i
could
not
forget
my
troubles
the
last
five
miles
or
so
were
the
most
beautiful
part
of
the
journey
for
the
country
became
more
undulating
and
the
woods
were
more
extensive
but
the
first
sight
of
the
city
of
the
colleges
itself
was
the
most
delightful
of
all
i
can
not
imagine
that
there
can
be
any
fairer
in
the
whole
world
and
i
expressed
my
pleasure
to
my
companion
and
thanked
him
for
having
brought
me
we
drove
to
an
inn
in
the
middle
of
the
town
and
then
while
it
was
still
light
my
friend
the
cashier
whose
name
was
thims
took
me
for
a
stroll
in
the
streets
and
in
the
of
the
principal
colleges
their
beauty
and
interest
were
extreme
it
was
impossible
to
see
them
without
being
attracted
towards
them
and
i
thought
to
myself
that
he
must
be
indeed
an
and
ungrateful
person
who
can
have
been
a
member
of
one
of
these
colleges
without
retaining
an
affectionate
feeling
towards
it
for
the
rest
of
his
life
all
my
misgivings
gave
way
at
once
when
i
saw
the
beauty
and
venerable
appearance
of
this
delightful
city
for
i
forgot
both
myself
and
arowhena
after
supper
thims
told
me
a
good
deal
about
the
system
of
education
which
is
here
practised
i
already
knew
a
part
of
what
i
heard
but
much
was
new
to
me
and
i
obtained
a
better
idea
of
the
erewhonian
position
than
i
had
done
hitherto
nevertheless
there
were
parts
of
the
scheme
of
which
i
could
not
comprehend
the
fitness
although
i
fully
admit
that
this
inability
was
probably
the
result
of
my
having
been
trained
so
very
differently
and
to
my
being
then
much
out
of
sorts
the
main
feature
in
their
system
is
the
prominence
which
they
give
to
a
study
which
i
can
only
translate
by
the
word
hypothetics
they
argue
thus
that
to
teach
a
boy
merely
the
nature
of
the
things
which
exist
in
the
world
around
him
and
about
which
he
will
have
to
be
conversant
during
his
whole
life
would
be
giving
him
but
a
narrow
and
shallow
conception
of
the
universe
which
it
is
urged
might
contain
all
manner
of
things
which
are
not
now
to
be
found
therein
to
open
his
eyes
to
these
possibilities
and
so
to
prepare
him
for
all
sorts
of
emergencies
is
the
object
of
this
system
of
hypothetics
to
imagine
a
set
of
utterly
strange
and
impossible
contingencies
and
require
the
youths
to
give
intelligent
answers
to
the
questions
that
arise
therefrom
is
reckoned
the
fittest
conceivable
way
of
preparing
them
for
the
actual
conduct
of
their
affairs
in
after
life
thus
they
are
taught
what
is
called
the
hypothetical
language
for
many
of
their
best
years
a
language
which
was
originally
composed
at
a
time
when
the
country
was
in
a
very
different
state
of
civilisation
to
what
it
is
at
present
a
state
which
has
long
since
disappeared
and
been
superseded
many
valuable
maxims
and
noble
thoughts
which
were
at
one
time
concealed
in
it
have
become
current
in
their
modern
literature
and
have
been
translated
over
and
over
again
into
the
language
now
spoken
surely
then
it
would
seem
enough
that
the
study
of
the
original
language
should
be
confined
to
the
few
whose
instincts
led
them
naturally
to
pursue
it
but
the
erewhonians
think
differently
the
store
they
set
by
this
hypothetical
language
can
hardly
be
believed
they
will
even
give
any
one
a
maintenance
for
life
if
he
attains
a
considerable
proficiency
in
the
study
of
it
nay
they
will
spend
years
in
learning
to
translate
some
of
their
own
good
poetry
into
the
hypothetical
language
to
do
so
with
fluency
being
reckoned
a
distinguishing
mark
of
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
be
flippant
but
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
wanton
waste
of
good
human
energy
that
men
should
spend
years
and
years
in
the
perfection
of
so
barren
an
exercise
when
their
own
civilisation
presented
problems
by
the
hundred
which
cried
aloud
for
solution
and
would
have
paid
the
solver
handsomely
but
people
know
their
own
affairs
best
if
the
youths
chose
it
for
themselves
i
should
have
wondered
less
but
they
do
not
choose
it
they
have
it
thrust
upon
them
and
for
the
most
part
are
disinclined
towards
it
i
can
only
say
that
all
i
heard
in
defence
of
the
system
was
insufficient
to
make
me
think
very
highly
of
its
advantages
the
arguments
in
favour
of
the
deliberate
development
of
the
unreasoning
faculties
were
much
more
cogent
but
here
they
depart
from
the
principles
on
which
they
justify
their
study
of
hypothetics
for
they
base
the
importance
which
they
assign
to
hypothetics
upon
the
fact
of
their
being
a
preparation
for
the
extraordinary
while
their
study
of
unreason
rests
upon
its
developing
those
faculties
which
are
required
for
the
daily
conduct
of
affairs
hence
their
professorships
of
inconsistency
and
evasion
in
both
of
which
studies
the
youths
are
examined
before
being
allowed
to
proceed
to
their
degree
in
hypothetics
the
more
earnest
and
conscientious
students
attain
to
a
proficiency
in
these
subjects
which
is
quite
surprising
there
is
hardly
any
inconsistency
so
glaring
but
they
soon
learn
to
defend
it
or
injunction
so
clear
that
they
can
not
find
some
pretext
for
disregarding
it
life
they
urge
would
be
intolerable
if
men
were
to
be
guided
in
all
they
did
by
reason
and
reason
only
reason
betrays
men
into
the
drawing
of
hard
and
fast
lines
and
to
the
defining
by
language
language
being
like
the
sun
which
rears
and
then
scorches
extremes
are
alone
logical
but
they
are
always
absurd
the
mean
is
illogical
but
an
illogical
mean
is
better
than
the
sheer
absurdity
of
an
extreme
there
are
no
follies
and
no
unreasonablenesses
so
great
as
those
which
can
apparently
be
irrefragably
defended
by
reason
itself
and
there
is
hardly
an
error
into
which
men
may
not
easily
be
led
if
they
base
their
conduct
upon
reason
only
reason
might
very
possibly
abolish
the
double
currency
it
might
even
attack
the
personality
of
hope
and
justice
besides
people
have
such
a
strong
natural
bias
towards
it
that
they
will
seek
it
for
themselves
and
act
upon
it
quite
as
much
as
or
more
than
is
good
for
them
there
is
no
need
of
encouraging
reason
with
unreason
the
case
is
different
she
is
the
natural
complement
of
reason
without
whose
existence
reason
itself
were
if
then
reason
would
be
were
there
no
such
thing
as
unreason
surely
it
follows
that
the
more
unreason
there
is
the
more
reason
there
must
be
also
hence
the
necessity
for
the
development
of
unreason
even
in
the
interests
of
reason
herself
the
professors
of
unreason
deny
that
they
undervalue
reason
none
can
be
more
convinced
than
they
are
that
if
the
double
currency
can
not
be
rigorously
deduced
as
a
necessary
consequence
of
human
reason
the
double
currency
should
cease
forthwith
but
they
say
that
it
must
be
deduced
from
no
narrow
and
exclusive
view
of
reason
which
should
deprive
that
admirable
faculty
of
the
of
its
own
existence
unreason
is
a
part
of
reason
it
must
therefore
be
allowed
its
full
share
in
stating
the
initial
conditions
chapter
xxii
the
colleges
of
unreason
continued
of
genius
they
make
no
account
for
they
say
that
every
one
is
a
genius
more
or
less
no
one
is
so
physically
sound
that
no
part
of
him
will
be
even
a
little
unsound
and
no
one
is
so
diseased
but
that
some
part
of
him
will
be
healthy
so
no
man
is
so
mentally
and
morally
sound
but
that
he
will
be
in
part
both
mad
and
wicked
and
no
man
is
so
mad
and
wicked
but
he
will
be
sensible
and
honourable
in
part
in
like
manner
there
is
no
genius
who
is
not
also
a
fool
and
no
fool
who
is
not
also
a
genius
when
i
talked
about
originality
and
genius
to
some
gentlemen
whom
i
met
at
a
supper
party
given
by
thims
in
my
honour
and
said
that
original
thought
ought
to
be
encouraged
i
had
to
eat
my
words
at
once
their
view
evidently
was
that
genius
was
like
offences
needs
must
that
it
come
but
woe
unto
that
man
through
whom
it
comes
a
man
business
they
hold
is
to
think
as
his
neighbours
do
for
heaven
help
him
if
he
thinks
good
what
they
count
bad
and
really
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
erewhonian
theory
differs
from
our
own
for
the
word
idiot
only
means
a
person
who
forms
his
opinions
for
himself
the
venerable
professor
of
worldly
wisdom
a
man
verging
on
eighty
but
still
hale
spoke
to
me
very
seriously
on
this
subject
in
consequence
of
the
few
words
that
i
had
imprudently
let
fall
in
defence
of
genius
he
was
one
of
those
who
carried
most
weight
in
the
university
and
had
the
reputation
of
having
done
more
perhaps
than
any
other
living
man
to
suppress
any
kind
of
originality
it
is
not
our
business
he
said
to
help
students
to
think
for
themselves
surely
this
is
the
very
last
thing
which
one
who
wishes
them
well
should
encourage
them
to
do
our
duty
is
to
ensure
that
they
shall
think
as
we
do
or
at
any
rate
as
we
hold
it
expedient
to
say
we
do
in
some
respects
however
he
was
thought
to
hold
somewhat
radical
opinions
for
he
was
president
of
the
society
for
the
suppression
of
useless
knowledge
and
for
the
completer
obliteration
of
the
past
as
regards
the
tests
that
a
youth
must
pass
before
he
can
get
a
degree
i
found
that
they
have
no
class
lists
and
discourage
anything
like
competition
among
the
students
this
indeed
they
regard
as
and
unneighbourly
the
examinations
are
conducted
by
way
of
papers
written
by
the
candidate
on
set
subjects
some
of
which
are
known
to
him
beforehand
while
others
are
devised
with
a
view
of
testing
his
general
capacity
and
my
friend
the
professor
of
worldly
wisdom
was
the
terror
of
the
greater
number
of
students
and
so
far
as
i
could
judge
he
very
well
might
be
for
he
had
taken
his
professorship
more
seriously
than
any
of
the
other
professors
had
done
i
heard
of
his
having
plucked
one
poor
fellow
for
want
of
sufficient
vagueness
in
his
saving
clauses
paper
another
was
sent
down
for
having
written
an
article
on
a
scientific
subject
without
having
made
free
enough
use
of
the
words
carefully
patiently
and
earnestly
one
man
was
refused
a
degree
for
being
too
often
and
too
seriously
in
the
right
while
a
few
days
before
i
came
a
whole
batch
had
been
plucked
for
insufficient
distrust
of
printed
matter
about
this
there
was
just
then
rather
a
ferment
for
it
seems
that
the
professor
had
written
an
article
in
the
leading
university
magazine
which
was
well
known
to
be
by
him
and
which
abounded
in
all
sorts
of
plausible
blunders
he
then
set
a
paper
which
afforded
the
examinees
an
opportunity
of
repeating
these
blunders
which
believing
the
article
to
be
by
their
own
examiner
they
of
course
did
the
professor
plucked
every
single
one
of
them
but
his
action
was
considered
to
have
been
not
quite
handsome
i
told
them
of
homer
noble
line
to
the
effect
that
a
man
should
strive
ever
to
be
foremost
and
in
all
things
to
outvie
his
peers
but
they
said
that
no
wonder
the
countries
in
which
such
a
detestable
maxim
was
held
in
admiration
were
always
flying
at
one
another
throats
why
asked
one
professor
should
a
man
want
to
be
better
than
his
neighbours
let
him
be
thankful
if
he
is
no
worse
i
ventured
feebly
to
say
that
i
did
not
see
how
progress
could
be
made
in
any
art
or
science
or
indeed
in
anything
at
all
without
more
or
less
and
hence
unamiability
of
course
it
can
not
said
the
professor
and
therefore
we
object
to
progress
after
which
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
later
on
however
a
young
professor
took
me
aside
and
said
he
did
not
think
i
quite
understood
their
views
about
progress
we
like
progress
he
said
but
it
must
commend
itself
to
the
common
sense
of
the
people
if
a
man
gets
to
know
more
than
his
neighbours
he
should
keep
his
knowledge
to
himself
till
he
has
sounded
them
and
seen
whether
they
agree
or
are
likely
to
agree
with
him
he
said
it
was
as
immoral
to
be
too
far
in
front
of
one
own
age
as
to
lag
too
far
behind
it
if
a
man
can
carry
his
neighbours
with
him
he
may
say
what
he
likes
but
if
not
what
insult
can
be
more
gratuitous
than
the
telling
them
what
they
do
not
want
to
know
a
man
should
remember
that
intellectual
is
one
of
the
most
insidious
and
disgraceful
forms
that
excess
can
take
granted
that
every
one
should
exceed
more
or
less
inasmuch
as
absolutely
perfect
sanity
would
drive
any
man
mad
the
moment
he
reached
it
but
he
was
now
warming
to
his
subject
and
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
how
i
should
get
rid
of
him
when
the
party
broke
up
and
though
i
promised
to
call
on
him
before
i
left
i
was
unfortunately
prevented
from
doing
so
i
have
now
said
enough
to
give
english
readers
some
idea
of
the
strange
views
which
the
erewhonians
hold
concerning
unreason
hypothetics
and
education
generally
in
many
respects
they
were
sensible
enough
but
i
could
not
get
over
the
hypothetics
especially
the
turning
their
own
good
poetry
into
the
hypothetical
language
in
the
course
of
my
stay
i
met
one
youth
who
told
me
that
for
fourteen
years
the
hypothetical
language
had
been
almost
the
only
thing
that
he
had
been
taught
although
he
had
never
to
his
credit
as
it
seemed
to
me
shown
the
slightest
proclivity
towards
it
while
he
had
been
endowed
with
not
inconsiderable
ability
for
several
other
branches
of
human
learning
he
assured
me
that
he
would
never
open
another
hypothetical
book
after
he
had
taken
his
degree
but
would
follow
out
the
bent
of
his
own
inclinations
this
was
well
enough
but
who
could
give
him
his
fourteen
years
back
again
i
sometimes
wondered
how
it
was
that
the
mischief
done
was
not
more
clearly
perceptible
and
that
the
young
men
and
women
grew
up
as
sensible
and
goodly
as
they
did
in
spite
of
the
attempts
almost
deliberately
made
to
warp
and
stunt
their
growth
some
doubtless
received
damage
from
which
they
suffered
to
their
life
end
but
many
seemed
little
or
none
the
worse
and
some
almost
the
better
the
reason
would
seem
to
be
that
the
natural
instinct
of
the
lads
in
most
cases
so
absolutely
rebelled
against
their
training
that
do
what
the
teachers
might
they
could
never
get
them
to
pay
serious
heed
to
it
the
consequence
was
that
the
boys
only
lost
their
time
and
not
so
much
of
this
as
might
have
been
expected
for
in
their
hours
of
leisure
they
were
actively
engaged
in
exercises
and
sports
which
developed
their
physical
nature
and
made
them
at
any
rate
strong
and
healthy
moreover
those
who
had
any
special
tastes
could
not
be
restrained
from
developing
them
they
would
learn
what
they
wanted
to
learn
and
liked
in
spite
of
obstacles
which
seemed
rather
to
urge
them
on
than
to
discourage
them
while
for
those
who
had
no
special
capacity
the
loss
of
time
was
of
comparatively
little
moment
but
in
spite
of
these
alleviations
of
the
mischief
i
am
sure
that
much
harm
was
done
to
the
children
of
the
wealthy
classes
by
the
system
which
passes
current
among
the
erewhonians
as
education
the
poorest
children
suffered
least
if
destruction
and
death
have
heard
the
sound
of
wisdom
to
a
certain
extent
poverty
has
done
so
also
and
yet
perhaps
after
all
it
is
better
for
a
country
that
its
seats
of
learning
should
do
more
to
suppress
mental
growth
than
to
encourage
it
were
it
not
for
a
certain
priggishness
which
these
places
infuse
into
so
great
a
number
of
their
genuine
work
would
become
dangerously
common
it
is
essential
that
by
far
the
greater
part
of
what
is
said
or
done
in
the
world
should
be
so
ephemeral
as
to
take
itself
away
quickly
it
should
keep
good
for
hours
or
even
twice
as
long
but
it
should
not
be
good
enough
a
week
hence
to
prevent
people
from
going
on
to
something
else
no
doubt
the
marvellous
development
of
journalism
in
england
as
also
the
fact
that
our
seats
of
learning
aim
rather
at
fostering
mediocrity
than
anything
higher
is
due
to
our
subconscious
recognition
of
the
fact
that
it
is
even
more
necessary
to
check
exuberance
of
mental
development
than
to
encourage
it
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
is
what
our
academic
bodies
do
and
they
do
it
the
more
effectually
because
they
do
it
only
subconsciously
they
think
they
are
advancing
healthy
mental
assimilation
and
digestion
whereas
in
reality
they
are
little
better
than
cancer
in
the
stomach
let
me
return
however
to
the
erewhonians
nothing
surprised
me
more
than
to
see
the
occasional
flashes
of
common
sense
with
which
one
branch
of
study
or
another
was
lit
up
while
not
a
single
ray
fell
upon
so
many
others
i
was
particularly
struck
with
this
on
strolling
into
the
art
school
of
the
university
here
i
found
that
the
course
of
study
was
divided
into
two
branches
the
practical
and
the
commercial
no
student
being
permitted
to
continue
his
studies
in
the
actual
practice
of
the
art
he
had
taken
up
unless
he
made
equal
progress
in
its
commercial
history
thus
those
who
were
studying
painting
were
examined
at
frequent
intervals
in
the
prices
which
all
the
leading
pictures
of
the
last
fifty
or
a
hundred
years
had
realised
and
in
the
fluctuations
in
their
values
when
as
often
happened
they
had
been
sold
and
resold
three
or
four
times
the
artist
they
contend
is
a
dealer
in
pictures
and
it
is
as
important
for
him
to
learn
how
to
adapt
his
wares
to
the
market
and
to
know
approximately
what
kind
of
a
picture
will
fetch
how
much
as
it
is
for
him
to
be
able
to
paint
the
picture
this
i
suppose
is
what
the
french
mean
by
laying
so
much
stress
upon
values
as
regards
the
city
itself
the
more
i
saw
the
more
enchanted
i
became
i
dare
not
trust
myself
with
any
description
of
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
different
colleges
and
their
walks
and
gardens
truly
in
these
things
alone
there
must
be
a
hallowing
and
refining
influence
which
is
in
itself
half
an
education
and
which
no
amount
of
error
can
wholly
spoil
i
was
introduced
to
many
of
the
professors
who
showed
me
every
hospitality
and
kindness
nevertheless
i
could
hardly
avoid
a
sort
of
suspicion
that
some
of
those
whom
i
was
taken
to
see
had
been
so
long
engrossed
in
their
own
study
of
hypothetics
that
they
had
become
the
exact
antitheses
of
the
athenians
in
the
days
of
paul
for
whereas
the
athenians
spent
their
lives
in
nothing
save
to
see
and
to
hear
some
new
thing
there
were
some
here
who
seemed
to
devote
themselves
to
the
avoidance
of
every
opinion
with
which
they
were
not
perfectly
familiar
and
regarded
their
own
brains
as
a
sort
of
sanctuary
to
which
if
an
opinion
had
once
resorted
none
other
was
to
attack
it
i
should
warn
the
reader
however
that
i
was
rarely
sure
what
the
men
whom
i
met
while
staying
with
thims
really
meant
for
there
was
no
getting
anything
out
of
them
if
they
scented
even
a
suspicion
that
they
might
be
what
they
call
giving
themselves
away
as
there
is
hardly
any
subject
on
which
this
suspicion
can
not
arise
i
found
it
difficult
to
get
definite
opinions
from
any
of
them
except
on
such
subjects
as
the
weather
eating
and
drinking
holiday
excursions
or
games
of
skill
if
they
can
not
wriggle
out
of
expressing
an
opinion
of
some
sort
they
will
commonly
retail
those
of
some
one
who
has
already
written
upon
the
subject
and
conclude
by
saying
that
though
they
quite
admit
that
there
is
an
element
of
truth
in
what
the
writer
has
said
there
are
many
points
on
which
they
are
unable
to
agree
with
him
which
these
points
were
i
invariably
found
myself
unable
to
determine
indeed
it
seemed
to
be
counted
the
perfection
of
scholarship
and
good
breeding
among
them
not
to
have
much
less
to
express
an
opinion
on
any
subject
on
which
it
might
prove
later
that
they
had
been
mistaken
the
art
of
sitting
gracefully
on
a
fence
has
never
i
should
think
been
brought
to
greater
perfection
than
at
the
erewhonian
colleges
of
unreason
even
when
wriggle
as
they
may
they
find
themselves
pinned
down
to
some
expression
of
definite
opinion
as
often
as
not
they
will
argue
in
support
of
what
they
perfectly
well
know
to
be
untrue
i
repeatedly
met
with
reviews
and
articles
even
in
their
best
journals
between
the
lines
of
which
i
had
little
difficulty
in
detecting
a
sense
exactly
contrary
to
the
one
ostensibly
put
forward
so
well
is
this
understood
that
a
man
must
be
a
mere
tyro
in
the
arts
of
erewhonian
polite
society
unless
he
instinctively
suspects
a
hidden
yea
in
every
nay
that
meets
him
granted
that
it
comes
to
much
the
same
in
the
end
for
it
does
not
matter
whether
yea
is
called
yea
or
nay
so
long
as
it
is
understood
which
it
is
to
be
but
our
own
more
direct
way
of
calling
a
spade
a
spade
rather
than
a
rake
with
the
intention
that
every
one
should
understand
it
as
a
spade
seems
more
satisfactory
on
the
other
hand
the
erewhonian
system
lends
itself
better
to
the
suppression
of
that
downrightness
which
it
seems
the
express
aim
of
erewhonian
philosophy
to
discountenance
however
this
may
be
the
disease
was
fatal
to
the
intelligence
of
those
infected
by
it
and
almost
every
one
at
the
colleges
of
unreason
had
caught
it
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
after
a
few
years
atrophy
of
the
opinions
invariably
supervened
and
the
sufferer
became
stone
dead
to
everything
except
the
more
superficial
aspects
of
those
material
objects
with
which
he
came
most
in
contact
the
expression
on
the
faces
of
these
people
was
repellent
they
did
not
however
seem
particularly
unhappy
for
they
none
of
them
had
the
faintest
idea
that
they
were
in
reality
more
dead
than
alive
no
cure
for
this
disgusting
disease
has
yet
been
discovered
it
was
during
my
stay
in
city
of
the
colleges
of
unreason
a
city
whose
erewhonian
name
is
so
cacophonous
that
i
refrain
from
giving
it
that
i
learned
the
particulars
of
the
revolution
which
had
ended
in
the
destruction
of
so
many
of
the
mechanical
inventions
which
were
formerly
in
common
use
thims
took
me
to
the
rooms
of
a
gentleman
who
had
a
great
reputation
for
learning
but
who
was
also
so
thims
told
me
rather
a
dangerous
person
inasmuch
as
he
had
attempted
to
introduce
an
adverb
into
the
hypothetical
language
he
had
heard
of
my
watch
and
been
exceedingly
anxious
to
see
me
for
he
was
accounted
the
most
learned
antiquary
in
erewhon
on
the
subject
of
mechanical
lore
we
fell
to
talking
upon
the
subject
and
when
i
left
he
gave
me
a
reprinted
copy
of
the
work
which
brought
the
revolution
about
it
had
taken
place
some
five
hundred
years
before
my
arrival
people
had
long
become
thoroughly
used
to
the
change
although
at
the
time
that
it
was
made
the
country
was
plunged
into
the
deepest
misery
and
a
reaction
which
followed
had
very
nearly
proved
successful
civil
war
raged
for
many
years
and
is
said
to
have
reduced
the
number
of
the
inhabitants
by
the
parties
were
styled
the
machinists
and
the
and
in
the
end
as
i
have
said
already
the
latter
got
the
victory
treating
their
opponents
with
such
unparalleled
severity
that
they
extirpated
every
trace
of
opposition
the
wonder
was
that
they
allowed
any
mechanical
appliances
to
remain
in
the
kingdom
neither
do
i
believe
that
they
would
have
done
so
had
not
the
professors
of
inconsistency
and
evasion
made
a
stand
against
the
carrying
of
the
new
principles
to
their
legitimate
conclusions
these
professors
moreover
insisted
that
during
the
struggle
the
should
use
every
known
improvement
in
the
art
of
war
and
several
new
weapons
offensive
and
defensive
were
invented
while
it
was
in
progress
i
was
surprised
at
there
remaining
so
many
mechanical
specimens
as
are
seen
in
the
museums
and
at
students
having
rediscovered
their
past
uses
so
completely
for
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
the
victors
wrecked
all
the
more
complicated
machines
and
burned
all
treatises
on
mechanics
and
all
engineers
workshops
thus
so
they
thought
cutting
the
mischief
out
root
and
branch
at
an
incalculable
cost
of
blood
and
treasure
certainly
they
had
not
spared
their
labour
but
work
of
this
description
can
never
be
perfectly
achieved
and
when
some
two
hundred
years
before
my
arrival
all
passion
upon
the
subject
had
cooled
down
and
no
one
save
a
lunatic
would
have
dreamed
of
reintroducing
forbidden
inventions
the
subject
came
to
be
regarded
as
a
curious
antiquarian
study
like
that
of
some
religious
practices
among
ourselves
then
came
the
careful
search
for
whatever
fragments
could
be
found
and
for
any
machines
that
might
have
been
hidden
away
and
also
numberless
treatises
were
written
showing
what
the
functions
of
each
rediscovered
machine
had
been
all
being
done
with
no
idea
of
using
such
machinery
again
but
with
the
feelings
of
an
english
antiquarian
concerning
druidical
monuments
or
flint
arrow
heads
on
my
return
to
the
metropolis
during
the
remaining
weeks
or
rather
days
of
my
sojourn
in
erewhon
i
made
a
in
english
of
the
work
which
brought
about
the
already
mentioned
revolution
my
ignorance
of
technical
terms
has
led
me
doubtless
into
many
errors
and
i
have
occasionally
where
i
found
translation
impossible
substituted
purely
english
names
and
ideas
for
the
original
erewhonian
ones
but
the
reader
may
rely
on
my
general
accuracy
i
have
thought
it
best
to
insert
my
translation
here
chapter
xxiii
the
book
of
the
machines
the
writer
commences
there
was
a
time
when
the
earth
was
to
all
appearance
utterly
destitute
both
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
and
when
according
to
the
opinion
of
our
best
philosophers
it
was
simply
a
hot
round
ball
with
a
crust
gradually
cooling
now
if
a
human
being
had
existed
while
the
earth
was
in
this
state
and
had
been
allowed
to
see
it
as
though
it
were
some
other
world
with
which
he
had
no
concern
and
if
at
the
same
time
he
were
entirely
ignorant
of
all
physical
science
would
he
not
have
pronounced
it
impossible
that
creatures
possessed
of
anything
like
consciousness
should
be
evolved
from
the
seeming
cinder
which
he
was
beholding
would
he
not
have
denied
that
it
contained
any
potentiality
of
consciousness
yet
in
the
course
of
time
consciousness
came
is
it
not
possible
then
that
there
may
be
even
yet
new
channels
dug
out
for
consciousness
though
we
can
detect
no
signs
of
them
at
present
again
consciousness
in
anything
like
the
present
acceptation
of
the
term
having
been
once
a
new
thing
a
thing
as
far
as
we
can
see
subsequent
even
to
an
individual
centre
of
action
and
to
a
reproductive
system
which
we
see
existing
in
plants
without
apparent
consciousness
why
may
not
there
arise
some
new
phase
of
mind
which
shall
be
as
different
from
all
present
known
phases
as
the
mind
of
animals
is
from
that
of
vegetables
it
would
be
absurd
to
attempt
to
define
such
a
mental
state
or
whatever
it
may
be
called
inasmuch
as
it
must
be
something
so
foreign
to
man
that
his
experience
can
give
him
no
help
towards
conceiving
its
nature
but
surely
when
we
reflect
upon
the
manifold
phases
of
life
and
consciousness
which
have
been
evolved
already
it
would
be
rash
to
say
that
no
others
can
be
developed
and
that
animal
life
is
the
end
of
all
things
there
was
a
time
when
fire
was
the
end
of
all
things
another
when
rocks
and
water
were
so
the
writer
after
enlarging
on
the
above
for
several
pages
proceeded
to
inquire
whether
traces
of
the
approach
of
such
a
new
phase
of
life
could
be
perceived
at
present
whether
we
could
see
any
tenements
preparing
which
might
in
a
remote
futurity
be
adapted
for
it
whether
in
fact
the
primordial
cell
of
such
a
kind
of
life
could
be
now
detected
upon
earth
in
the
course
of
his
work
he
answered
this
question
in
the
affirmative
and
pointed
to
the
higher
machines
there
is
no
security
to
quote
his
own
words
against
the
ultimate
development
of
mechanical
consciousness
in
the
fact
of
machines
possessing
little
consciousness
now
a
mollusc
has
not
much
consciousness
reflect
upon
the
extraordinary
advance
which
machines
have
made
during
the
last
few
hundred
years
and
note
how
slowly
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
are
advancing
the
more
highly
organised
machines
are
creatures
not
so
much
of
yesterday
as
of
the
last
five
minutes
so
to
speak
in
comparison
with
past
time
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
conscious
beings
have
existed
for
some
twenty
million
years
see
what
strides
machines
have
made
in
the
last
thousand
may
not
the
world
last
twenty
million
years
longer
if
so
what
will
they
not
in
the
end
become
is
it
not
safer
to
nip
the
mischief
in
the
bud
and
to
forbid
them
further
progress
but
who
can
say
that
the
vapour
engine
has
not
a
kind
of
consciousness
where
does
consciousness
begin
and
where
end
who
can
draw
the
line
who
can
draw
any
line
is
not
everything
interwoven
with
everything
is
not
machinery
linked
with
animal
life
in
an
infinite
variety
of
ways
the
shell
of
a
hen
egg
is
made
of
a
delicate
white
ware
and
is
a
machine
as
much
as
an
is
the
shell
is
a
device
for
holding
the
egg
as
much
as
the
for
holding
the
shell
both
are
phases
of
the
same
function
the
hen
makes
the
shell
in
her
inside
but
it
is
pure
pottery
she
makes
her
nest
outside
of
herself
for
convenience
sake
but
the
nest
is
not
more
of
a
machine
than
the
is
a
is
only
a
then
returning
to
consciousness
and
endeavouring
to
detect
its
earliest
manifestations
the
writer
continued
there
is
a
kind
of
plant
that
eats
organic
food
with
its
flowers
when
a
fly
settles
upon
the
blossom
the
petals
close
upon
it
and
hold
it
fast
till
the
plant
has
absorbed
the
insect
into
its
system
but
they
will
close
on
nothing
but
what
is
good
to
eat
of
a
drop
of
rain
or
a
piece
of
stick
they
will
take
no
notice
curious
that
so
unconscious
a
thing
should
have
such
a
keen
eye
to
its
own
interest
if
this
is
unconsciousness
where
is
the
use
of
consciousness
shall
we
say
that
the
plant
does
not
know
what
it
is
doing
merely
because
it
has
no
eyes
or
ears
or
brains
if
we
say
that
it
acts
mechanically
and
mechanically
only
shall
we
not
be
forced
to
admit
that
sundry
other
and
apparently
very
deliberate
actions
are
also
mechanical
if
it
seems
to
us
that
the
plant
kills
and
eats
a
fly
mechanically
may
it
not
seem
to
the
plant
that
a
man
must
kill
and
eat
a
sheep
mechanically
but
it
may
be
said
that
the
plant
is
void
of
reason
because
the
growth
of
a
plant
is
an
involuntary
growth
given
earth
air
and
due
temperature
the
plant
must
grow
it
is
like
a
clock
which
being
once
wound
up
will
go
till
it
is
stopped
or
run
down
it
is
like
the
wind
blowing
on
the
sails
of
a
ship
the
ship
must
go
when
the
wind
blows
it
but
can
a
healthy
boy
help
growing
if
he
have
good
meat
and
drink
and
clothing
can
anything
help
going
as
long
as
it
is
wound
up
or
go
on
after
it
is
run
down
is
there
not
a
winding
up
process
everywhere
even
a
potato
in
a
dark
cellar
has
a
certain
low
cunning
about
him
which
serves
him
in
excellent
stead
he
knows
perfectly
well
what
he
wants
and
how
to
get
it
he
sees
the
light
coming
from
the
cellar
window
and
sends
his
shoots
crawling
straight
thereto
they
will
crawl
along
the
floor
and
up
the
wall
and
out
at
the
cellar
window
if
there
be
a
little
earth
anywhere
on
the
journey
he
will
find
it
and
use
it
for
his
own
ends
what
deliberation
he
may
exercise
in
the
matter
of
his
roots
when
he
is
planted
in
the
earth
is
a
thing
unknown
to
us
but
we
can
imagine
him
saying
will
have
a
tuber
here
and
a
tuber
there
and
i
will
suck
whatsoever
advantage
i
can
from
all
my
surroundings
this
neighbour
i
will
overshadow
and
that
i
will
undermine
and
what
i
can
do
shall
be
the
limit
of
what
i
will
do
he
that
is
stronger
and
better
placed
than
i
shall
overcome
me
and
him
that
is
weaker
i
will
overcome
the
potato
says
these
things
by
doing
them
which
is
the
best
of
languages
what
is
consciousness
if
this
is
not
consciousness
we
find
it
difficult
to
sympathise
with
the
emotions
of
a
potato
so
we
do
with
those
of
an
oyster
neither
of
these
things
makes
a
noise
on
being
boiled
or
opened
and
noise
appeals
to
us
more
strongly
than
anything
else
because
we
make
so
much
about
our
own
sufferings
since
then
they
do
not
annoy
us
by
any
expression
of
pain
we
call
them
emotionless
and
so
mankind
they
are
but
mankind
is
not
everybody
if
it
be
urged
that
the
action
of
the
potato
is
chemical
and
mechanical
only
and
that
it
is
due
to
the
chemical
and
mechanical
effects
of
light
and
heat
the
answer
would
seem
to
lie
in
an
inquiry
whether
every
sensation
is
not
chemical
and
mechanical
in
its
operation
whether
those
things
which
we
deem
most
purely
spiritual
are
anything
but
disturbances
of
equilibrium
in
an
infinite
series
of
levers
beginning
with
those
that
are
too
small
for
microscopic
detection
and
going
up
to
the
human
arm
and
the
appliances
which
it
makes
use
of
whether
there
be
not
a
molecular
action
of
thought
whence
a
dynamical
theory
of
the
passions
shall
be
deducible
whether
strictly
speaking
we
should
not
ask
what
kind
of
levers
a
man
is
made
of
rather
than
what
is
his
temperament
how
are
they
balanced
how
much
of
such
and
such
will
it
take
to
weigh
them
down
so
as
to
make
him
do
so
and
so
the
writer
went
on
to
say
that
he
anticipated
a
time
when
it
would
be
possible
by
examining
a
single
hair
with
a
powerful
microscope
to
know
whether
its
owner
could
be
insulted
with
impunity
he
then
became
more
and
more
obscure
so
that
i
was
obliged
to
give
up
all
attempt
at
translation
neither
did
i
follow
the
drift
of
his
argument
on
coming
to
the
next
part
which
i
could
construe
i
found
that
he
had
changed
his
ground
either
he
proceeds
a
great
deal
of
action
that
has
been
called
purely
mechanical
and
unconscious
must
be
admitted
to
contain
more
elements
of
consciousness
than
has
been
allowed
hitherto
and
in
this
case
germs
of
consciousness
will
be
found
in
many
actions
of
the
higher
machines
or
assuming
the
theory
of
evolution
but
at
the
same
time
denying
the
consciousness
of
vegetable
and
crystalline
action
the
race
of
man
has
descended
from
things
which
had
no
consciousness
at
all
in
this
case
there
is
no
improbability
in
the
descent
of
conscious
and
more
than
conscious
machines
from
those
which
now
exist
except
that
which
is
suggested
by
the
apparent
absence
of
anything
like
a
reproductive
system
in
the
mechanical
kingdom
this
absence
however
is
only
apparent
as
i
shall
presently
show
do
not
let
me
be
misunderstood
as
living
in
fear
of
any
actually
existing
machine
there
is
probably
no
known
machine
which
is
more
than
a
prototype
of
future
mechanical
life
the
present
machines
are
to
the
future
as
the
early
saurians
to
man
the
largest
of
them
will
probably
greatly
diminish
in
size
some
of
the
lowest
vertebrate
attained
a
much
greater
bulk
than
has
descended
to
their
more
highly
organised
living
representatives
and
in
like
manner
a
diminution
in
the
size
of
machines
has
often
attended
their
development
and
progress
take
the
watch
for
example
examine
its
beautiful
structure
observe
the
intelligent
play
of
the
minute
members
which
compose
it
yet
this
little
creature
is
but
a
development
of
the
cumbrous
clocks
that
preceded
it
it
is
no
deterioration
from
them
a
day
may
come
when
clocks
which
certainly
at
the
present
time
are
not
diminishing
in
bulk
will
be
superseded
owing
to
the
universal
use
of
watches
in
which
case
they
will
become
as
extinct
as
ichthyosauri
while
the
watch
whose
tendency
has
for
some
years
been
to
decrease
in
size
rather
than
the
contrary
will
remain
the
only
existing
type
of
an
extinct
race
but
returning
to
the
argument
i
would
repeat
that
i
fear
none
of
the
existing
machines
what
i
fear
is
the
extraordinary
rapidity
with
which
they
are
becoming
something
very
different
to
what
they
are
at
present
no
class
of
beings
have
in
any
time
past
made
so
rapid
a
movement
forward
should
not
that
movement
be
jealously
watched
and
checked
while
we
can
still
check
it
and
is
it
not
necessary
for
this
end
to
destroy
the
more
advanced
of
the
machines
which
are
in
use
at
present
though
it
is
admitted
that
they
are
in
themselves
harmless
as
yet
the
machines
receive
their
impressions
through
the
agency
of
man
senses
one
travelling
machine
calls
to
another
in
a
shrill
accent
of
alarm
and
the
other
instantly
retires
but
it
is
through
the
ears
of
the
driver
that
the
voice
of
the
one
has
acted
upon
the
other
had
there
been
no
driver
the
callee
would
have
been
deaf
to
the
caller
there
was
a
time
when
it
must
have
seemed
highly
improbable
that
machines
should
learn
to
make
their
wants
known
by
sound
even
through
the
ears
of
man
may
we
not
conceive
then
that
a
day
will
come
when
those
ears
will
be
no
longer
needed
and
the
hearing
will
be
done
by
the
delicacy
of
the
machine
own
construction
when
its
language
shall
have
been
developed
from
the
cry
of
animals
to
a
speech
as
intricate
as
our
own
it
is
possible
that
by
that
time
children
will
learn
the
differential
calculus
as
they
learn
now
to
speak
from
their
mothers
and
nurses
or
that
they
may
talk
in
the
hypothetical
language
and
work
rule
of
three
sums
as
soon
as
they
are
born
but
this
is
not
probable
we
can
not
calculate
on
any
corresponding
advance
in
man
intellectual
or
physical
powers
which
shall
be
a
against
the
far
greater
development
which
seems
in
store
for
the
machines
some
people
may
say
that
man
moral
influence
will
suffice
to
rule
them
but
i
can
not
think
it
will
ever
be
safe
to
repose
much
trust
in
the
moral
sense
of
any
machine
again
might
not
the
glory
of
the
machines
consist
in
their
being
without
this
same
boasted
gift
of
language
it
has
been
said
by
one
writer
a
virtue
which
renders
us
agreeable
to
our
chapter
xxiv
the
machines
continued
but
other
questions
come
upon
us
what
is
a
man
eye
but
a
machine
for
the
little
creature
that
sits
behind
in
his
brain
to
look
through
a
dead
eye
is
nearly
as
good
as
a
living
one
for
some
time
after
the
man
is
dead
it
is
not
the
eye
that
can
not
see
but
the
restless
one
that
can
not
see
through
it
is
it
man
eyes
or
is
it
the
big
which
has
revealed
to
us
the
existence
of
worlds
beyond
worlds
into
infinity
what
has
made
man
familiar
with
the
scenery
of
the
moon
the
spots
on
the
sun
or
the
geography
of
the
planets
he
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
for
these
things
and
is
powerless
unless
he
tack
it
on
to
his
own
identity
and
make
it
part
and
parcel
of
himself
or
again
is
it
the
eye
or
the
little
which
has
shown
us
the
existence
of
infinitely
minute
organisms
which
swarm
unsuspected
around
us
and
take
man
vaunted
power
of
calculation
have
we
not
engines
which
can
do
all
manner
of
sums
more
quickly
and
correctly
than
we
can
what
prizeman
in
hypothetics
at
any
of
our
colleges
of
unreason
can
compare
with
some
of
these
machines
in
their
own
line
in
fact
wherever
precision
is
required
man
flies
to
the
machine
at
once
as
far
preferable
to
himself
our
never
drop
a
figure
nor
our
looms
a
stitch
the
machine
is
brisk
and
active
when
the
man
is
weary
it
is
and
collected
when
the
man
is
stupid
and
dull
it
needs
no
slumber
when
man
must
sleep
or
drop
ever
at
its
post
ever
ready
for
work
its
alacrity
never
flags
its
patience
never
gives
in
its
might
is
stronger
than
combined
hundreds
and
swifter
than
the
flight
of
birds
it
can
burrow
beneath
the
earth
and
walk
upon
the
largest
rivers
and
sink
not
this
is
the
green
tree
what
then
shall
be
done
in
the
dry
who
shall
say
that
a
man
does
see
or
hear
he
is
such
a
hive
and
swarm
of
parasites
that
it
is
doubtful
whether
his
body
is
not
more
theirs
than
his
and
whether
he
is
anything
but
another
kind
of
after
all
may
not
man
himself
become
a
sort
of
parasite
upon
the
machines
an
affectionate
aphid
it
is
said
by
some
that
our
blood
is
composed
of
infinite
living
agents
which
go
up
and
down
the
highways
and
byways
of
our
bodies
as
people
in
the
streets
of
a
city
when
we
look
down
from
a
high
place
upon
crowded
thoroughfares
is
it
possible
not
to
think
of
corpuscles
of
blood
travelling
through
veins
and
nourishing
the
heart
of
the
town
no
mention
shall
be
made
of
sewers
nor
of
the
hidden
nerves
which
serve
to
communicate
sensations
from
one
part
of
the
town
body
to
another
nor
of
the
yawning
jaws
of
the
railway
stations
whereby
the
circulation
is
carried
directly
into
the
heart
which
receive
the
venous
lines
and
disgorge
the
arterial
with
an
eternal
pulse
of
people
and
the
sleep
of
the
town
how
with
its
change
in
the
circulation
here
the
writer
became
again
so
hopelessly
obscure
that
i
was
obliged
to
miss
several
pages
he
resumed
it
can
be
answered
that
even
though
machines
should
hear
never
so
well
and
speak
never
so
wisely
they
will
still
always
do
the
one
or
the
other
for
our
advantage
not
their
own
that
man
will
be
the
ruling
spirit
and
the
machine
the
servant
that
as
soon
as
a
machine
fails
to
discharge
the
service
which
man
expects
from
it
it
is
doomed
to
extinction
that
the
machines
stand
to
man
simply
in
the
relation
of
lower
animals
the
engine
itself
being
only
a
more
economical
kind
of
horse
so
that
instead
of
being
likely
to
be
developed
into
a
higher
kind
of
life
than
man
they
owe
their
very
existence
and
progress
to
their
power
of
ministering
to
human
wants
and
must
therefore
both
now
and
ever
be
man
inferiors
this
is
all
very
well
but
the
servant
glides
by
imperceptible
approaches
into
the
master
and
we
have
come
to
such
a
pass
that
even
now
man
must
suffer
terribly
on
ceasing
to
benefit
the
machines
if
all
machines
were
to
be
annihilated
at
one
moment
so
that
not
a
knife
nor
lever
nor
rag
of
clothing
nor
anything
whatsoever
were
left
to
man
but
his
bare
body
alone
that
he
was
born
with
and
if
all
knowledge
of
mechanical
laws
were
taken
from
him
so
that
he
could
make
no
more
machines
and
all
food
destroyed
so
that
the
race
of
man
should
be
left
as
it
were
naked
upon
a
desert
island
we
should
become
extinct
in
six
weeks
a
few
miserable
individuals
might
linger
but
even
these
in
a
year
or
two
would
become
worse
than
monkeys
man
very
soul
is
due
to
the
machines
it
is
a
thing
he
thinks
as
he
thinks
and
feels
as
he
feels
through
the
work
that
machines
have
wrought
upon
him
and
their
existence
is
quite
as
much
a
qua
for
his
as
his
for
theirs
this
fact
precludes
us
from
proposing
the
complete
annihilation
of
machinery
but
surely
it
indicates
that
we
should
destroy
as
many
of
them
as
we
can
possibly
dispense
with
lest
they
should
tyrannise
over
us
even
more
completely
true
from
a
low
materialistic
point
of
view
it
would
seem
that
those
thrive
best
who
use
machinery
wherever
its
use
is
possible
with
profit
but
this
is
the
art
of
the
machines
they
serve
that
they
may
rule
they
bear
no
malice
towards
man
for
destroying
a
whole
race
of
them
provided
he
creates
a
better
instead
on
the
contrary
they
reward
him
liberally
for
having
hastened
their
development
it
is
for
neglecting
them
that
he
incurs
their
wrath
or
for
using
inferior
machines
or
for
not
making
sufficient
exertions
to
invent
new
ones
or
for
destroying
them
without
replacing
them
yet
these
are
the
very
things
we
ought
to
do
and
do
quickly
for
though
our
rebellion
against
their
infant
power
will
cause
infinite
suffering
what
will
not
things
come
to
if
that
rebellion
is
delayed
they
have
preyed
upon
man
grovelling
preference
for
his
material
over
his
spiritual
interests
and
have
betrayed
him
into
supplying
that
element
of
struggle
and
warfare
without
which
no
race
can
advance
the
lower
animals
progress
because
they
struggle
with
one
another
the
weaker
die
the
stronger
breed
and
transmit
their
strength
the
machines
being
of
themselves
unable
to
struggle
have
got
man
to
do
their
struggling
for
them
as
long
as
he
fulfils
this
function
duly
all
goes
well
with
him
at
least
he
thinks
so
but
the
moment
he
fails
to
do
his
best
for
the
advancement
of
machinery
by
encouraging
the
good
and
destroying
the
bad
he
is
left
behind
in
the
race
of
competition
and
this
means
that
he
will
be
made
uncomfortable
in
a
variety
of
ways
and
perhaps
die
so
that
even
now
the
machines
will
only
serve
on
condition
of
being
served
and
that
too
upon
their
own
terms
the
moment
their
terms
are
not
complied
with
they
jib
and
either
smash
both
themselves
and
all
whom
they
can
reach
or
turn
churlish
and
refuse
to
work
at
all
how
many
men
at
this
hour
are
living
in
a
state
of
bondage
to
the
machines
how
many
spend
their
whole
lives
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
in
tending
them
by
night
and
day
is
it
not
plain
that
the
machines
are
gaining
ground
upon
us
when
we
reflect
on
the
increasing
number
of
those
who
are
bound
down
to
them
as
slaves
and
of
those
who
devote
their
whole
souls
to
the
advancement
of
the
mechanical
kingdom
the
must
be
fed
with
food
and
consume
it
by
fire
even
as
man
consumes
it
it
supports
its
combustion
by
air
as
man
supports
it
it
has
a
pulse
and
circulation
as
man
has
it
may
be
granted
that
body
is
as
yet
the
more
versatile
of
the
two
but
then
man
body
is
an
older
thing
give
the
but
half
the
time
that
man
has
had
give
it
also
a
continuance
of
our
present
infatuation
and
what
may
it
not
ere
long
attain
to
there
are
certain
functions
indeed
of
the
which
will
probably
remain
unchanged
for
myriads
of
years
which
in
fact
will
perhaps
survive
when
the
use
of
vapour
has
been
superseded
the
piston
and
cylinder
the
beam
the
and
other
parts
of
the
machine
will
probably
be
permanent
just
as
we
see
that
man
and
many
of
the
lower
animals
share
like
modes
of
eating
drinking
and
sleeping
thus
they
have
hearts
which
beat
as
ours
veins
and
arteries
eyes
ears
and
noses
they
sigh
even
in
their
sleep
and
weep
and
yawn
they
are
affected
by
their
children
they
feel
pleasure
and
pain
hope
fear
anger
shame
they
have
memory
and
prescience
they
know
that
if
certain
things
happen
to
them
they
will
die
and
they
fear
death
as
much
as
we
do
they
communicate
their
thoughts
to
one
another
and
some
of
them
deliberately
act
in
concert
the
comparison
of
similarities
is
endless
i
only
make
it
because
some
may
say
that
since
the
is
not
likely
to
be
improved
in
the
main
particulars
it
is
unlikely
to
be
henceforward
extensively
modified
at
all
this
is
too
good
to
be
true
it
will
be
modified
and
suited
for
an
infinite
variety
of
purposes
as
much
as
man
has
been
modified
so
as
to
exceed
the
brutes
in
skill
in
the
meantime
the
stoker
is
almost
as
much
a
cook
for
his
engine
as
our
own
cooks
for
ourselves
consider
also
the
colliers
and
pitmen
and
coal
merchants
and
coal
trains
and
the
men
who
drive
them
and
the
ships
that
carry
coals
what
an
army
of
servants
do
the
machines
thus
employ
are
there
not
probably
more
men
engaged
in
tending
machinery
than
in
tending

not
machines
eat
as
it
were
by
mannery

we
not

creating
our
successors
in
the
supremacy
of
the

daily
adding
to
the
beauty
and
delicacy
of
their
organisation
daily
giving
them
greater
skill
and
supplying
more
and
more
of
that
power
which
will
be
better
than
any
intellect
what
a
new
thing
it
is
for
a
machine
to
feed
at
all
the
plough
the
spade
and
the
cart
must
eat
through
man
stomach
the
fuel
that
sets
them
going
must
burn
in
the
furnace
of
a
man
or
of
horses
man
must
consume
bread
and
meat
or
he
can
not
dig
the
bread
and
meat
are
the
fuel
which
drive
the
spade
if
a
plough
be
drawn
by
horses
the
power
is
supplied
by
grass
or
beans
or
oats
which
being
burnt
in
the
belly
of
the
cattle
give
the
power
of
working
without
this
fuel
the
work
would
cease
as
an
engine
would
stop
if
its
furnaces
were
to
go
out
a
man
of
science
has
demonstrated
no
animal
has
the
power
of
originating
mechanical
energy
but
that
all
the
work
done
in
its
life
by
any
animal
and
all
the
heat
that
has
been
emitted
from
it
and
the
heat
which
would
be
obtained
by
burning
the
combustible
matter
which
has
been
lost
from
its
body
during
life
and
by
burning
its
body
after
death
make
up
altogether
an
exact
equivalent
to
the
heat
which
would
be
obtained
by
burning
as
much
food
as
it
has
used
during
its
life
and
an
amount
of
fuel
which
would
generate
as
much
heat
as
its
body
if
burned
immediately
after
death
i
do
not
know
how
he
has
found
this
out
but
he
is
a
man
of
science
how
then
can
it
be
objected
against
the
future
vitality
of
the
machines
that
they
are
in
their
present
infancy
at
the
beck
and
call
of
beings
who
are
themselves
incapable
of
originating
mechanical
energy
the
main
point
however
to
be
observed
as
affording
cause
for
alarm
is
that
whereas
animals
were
formerly
the
only
stomachs
of
the
machines
there
are
now
many
which
have
stomachs
of
their
own
and
consume
their
food
themselves
this
is
a
great
step
towards
their
becoming
if
not
animate
yet
something
so
near
akin
to
it
as
not
to
differ
more
widely
from
our
own
life
than
animals
do
from
vegetables
and
though
man
should
remain
in
some
respects
the
higher
creature
is
not
this
in
accordance
with
the
practice
of
nature
which
allows
superiority
in
some
things
to
animals
which
have
on
the
whole
been
long
surpassed
has
she
not
allowed
the
ant
and
the
bee
to
retain
superiority
over
man
in
the
organisation
of
their
communities
and
social
arrangements
the
bird
in
traversing
the
air
the
fish
in
swimming
the
horse
in
strength
and
fleetness
and
the
dog
in
it
is
said
by
some
with
whom
i
have
conversed
upon
this
subject
that
the
machines
can
never
be
developed
into
animate
or
existences
inasmuch
as
they
have
no
reproductive
system
nor
seem
ever
likely
to
possess
one
if
this
be
taken
to
mean
that
they
can
not
marry
and
that
we
are
never
likely
to
see
a
fertile
union
between
two
engines
with
the
young
ones
playing
about
the
door
of
the
shed
however
greatly
we
might
desire
to
do
so
i
will
readily
grant
it
but
the
objection
is
not
a
very
profound
one
no
one
expects
that
all
the
features
of
the
now
existing
organisations
will
be
absolutely
repeated
in
an
entirely
new
class
of
life
the
reproductive
system
of
animals
differs
widely
from
that
of
plants
but
both
are
reproductive
systems
has
nature
exhausted
her
phases
of
this
power
surely
if
a
machine
is
able
to
reproduce
another
machine
systematically
we
may
say
that
it
has
a
reproductive
system
what
is
a
reproductive
system
if
it
be
not
a
system
for
reproduction
and
how
few
of
the
machines
are
there
which
have
not
been
produced
systematically
by
other
machines
but
it
is
man
that
makes
them
do
so
yes
but
is
it
not
insects
that
make
many
of
the
plants
reproductive
and
would
not
whole
families
of
plants
die
out
if
their
fertilisation
was
not
effected
by
a
class
of
agents
utterly
foreign
to
themselves
does
any
one
say
that
the
red
clover
has
no
reproductive
system
because
the
humble
bee
and
the
humble
bee
only
must
aid
and
abet
it
before
it
can
reproduce
no
one
the
humble
bee
is
a
part
of
the
reproductive
system
of
the
clover
each
one
of
ourselves
has
sprung
from
minute
animalcules
whose
entity
was
entirely
distinct
from
our
own
and
which
acted
after
their
kind
with
no
thought
or
heed
of
what
we
might
think
about
it
these
little
creatures
are
part
of
our
own
reproductive
system
then
why
not
we
part
of
that
of
the
machines
but
the
machines
which
reproduce
machinery
do
not
reproduce
machines
after
their
own
kind
a
thimble
may
be
made
by
machinery
but
it
was
not
made
by
neither
will
it
ever
make
a
thimble
here
again
if
we
turn
to
nature
we
shall
find
abundance
of
analogies
which
will
teach
us
that
a
reproductive
system
may
be
in
full
force
without
the
thing
produced
being
of
the
same
kind
as
that
which
produced
it
very
few
creatures
reproduce
after
their
own
kind
they
reproduce
something
which
has
the
potentiality
of
becoming
that
which
their
parents
were
thus
the
butterfly
lays
an
egg
which
egg
can
become
a
caterpillar
which
caterpillar
can
become
a
chrysalis
which
chrysalis
can
become
a
butterfly
and
though
i
freely
grant
that
the
machines
can
not
be
said
to
have
more
than
the
germ
of
a
true
reproductive
system
at
present
have
we
not
just
seen
that
they
have
only
recently
obtained
the
germs
of
a
mouth
and
stomach
and
may
not
some
stride
be
made
in
the
direction
of
true
reproduction
which
shall
be
as
great
as
that
which
has
been
recently
taken
in
the
direction
of
true
feeding
it
is
possible
that
the
system
when
developed
may
be
in
many
cases
a
vicarious
thing
certain
classes
of
machines
may
be
alone
fertile
while
the
rest
discharge
other
functions
in
the
mechanical
system
just
as
the
great
majority
of
ants
and
bees
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
continuation
of
their
species
but
get
food
and
store
it
without
thought
of
breeding
one
can
not
expect
the
parallel
to
be
complete
or
nearly
so
certainly
not
now
and
probably
never
but
is
there
not
enough
analogy
existing
at
the
present
moment
to
make
us
feel
seriously
uneasy
about
the
future
and
to
render
it
our
duty
to
check
the
evil
while
we
can
still
do
so
machines
can
within
certain
limits
beget
machines
of
any
class
no
matter
how
different
to
themselves
every
class
of
machines
will
probably
have
its
special
mechanical
breeders
and
all
the
higher
ones
will
owe
their
existence
to
a
large
number
of
parents
and
not
to
two
only
we
are
misled
by
considering
any
complicated
machine
as
a
single
thing
in
truth
it
is
a
city
or
society
each
member
of
which
was
bred
truly
after
its
kind
we
see
a
machine
as
a
whole
we
call
it
by
a
name
and
individualise
it
we
look
at
our
own
limbs
and
know
that
the
combination
forms
an
individual
which
springs
from
a
single
centre
of
reproductive
action
we
therefore
assume
that
there
can
be
no
reproductive
action
which
does
not
arise
from
a
single
centre
but
this
assumption
is
unscientific
and
the
bare
fact
that
no
was
ever
made
entirely
by
another
or
two
others
of
its
own
kind
is
not
sufficient
to
warrant
us
in
saying
that
have
no
reproductive
system
the
truth
is
that
each
part
of
every
is
bred
by
its
own
special
breeders
whose
function
it
is
to
breed
that
part
and
that
only
while
the
combination
of
the
parts
into
a
whole
forms
another
department
of
the
mechanical
reproductive
system
which
is
at
present
exceedingly
complex
and
difficult
to
see
in
its
entirety
complex
now
but
how
much
simpler
and
more
intelligibly
organised
may
it
not
become
in
another
hundred
thousand
years
or
in
twenty
thousand
for
man
at
present
believes
that
his
interest
lies
in
that
direction
he
spends
an
incalculable
amount
of
labour
and
time
and
thought
in
making
machines
breed
always
better
and
better
he
has
already
succeeded
in
effecting
much
that
at
one
time
appeared
impossible
and
there
seem
no
limits
to
the
results
of
accumulated
improvements
if
they
are
allowed
to
descend
with
modification
from
generation
to
generation
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
man
body
is
what
it
is
through
having
been
moulded
into
its
present
shape
by
the
chances
and
changes
of
many
millions
of
years
but
that
his
organisation
never
advanced
with
anything
like
the
rapidity
with
which
that
of
the
machines
is
advancing
this
is
the
most
alarming
feature
in
the
case
and
i
must
be
pardoned
for
insisting
on
it
so
frequently
chapter
xxv
the
machines
concluded
here
followed
a
very
long
and
untranslatable
digression
about
the
different
races
and
families
of
the
then
existing
machines
the
writer
attempted
to
support
his
theory
by
pointing
out
the
similarities
existing
between
many
machines
of
a
widely
different
character
which
served
to
show
descent
from
a
common
ancestor
he
divided
machines
into
their
genera
subgenera
species
varieties
subvarieties
and
so
forth
he
proved
the
existence
of
connecting
links
between
machines
that
seemed
to
have
very
little
in
common
and
showed
that
many
more
such
links
had
existed
but
had
now
perished
he
pointed
out
tendencies
to
reversion
and
the
presence
of
rudimentary
organs
which
existed
in
many
machines
feebly
developed
and
perfectly
useless
yet
serving
to
mark
descent
from
an
ancestor
to
whom
the
function
was
actually
useful
i
left
the
translation
of
this
part
of
the
treatise
which
by
the
way
was
far
longer
than
all
that
i
have
given
here
for
a
later
opportunity
unfortunately
i
left
erewhon
before
i
could
return
to
the
subject
and
though
i
saved
my
translation
and
other
papers
at
the
hazard
of
my
life
i
was
a
obliged
to
sacrifice
the
original
work
it
went
to
my
heart
to
do
so
but
i
thus
gained
ten
minutes
of
invaluable
time
without
which
both
arowhena
and
myself
must
have
certainly
perished
i
remember
one
incident
which
bears
upon
this
part
of
the
treatise
the
gentleman
who
gave
it
to
me
had
asked
to
see
my
he
examined
it
carefully
and
when
he
came
to
the
little
protuberance
at
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
he
seemed
much
delighted
and
exclaimed
that
it
must
be
rudimentary
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
sir
he
answered
this
organ
is
identical
with
the
rim
at
the
bottom
of
a
cup
it
is
but
another
form
of
the
same
function
its
purpose
must
have
been
to
keep
the
heat
of
the
pipe
from
marking
the
table
upon
which
it
rested
you
would
find
if
you
were
to
look
up
the
history
of
pipes
that
in
early
specimens
this
protuberance
was
of
a
different
shape
to
what
it
is
now
it
will
have
been
broad
at
the
bottom
and
flat
so
that
while
the
pipe
was
being
smoked
the
bowl
might
rest
upon
the
table
without
marking
it
use
and
disuse
must
have
come
into
play
and
reduced
the
function
to
its
present
rudimentary
condition
i
should
not
be
surprised
sir
he
continued
if
in
the
course
of
time
it
were
to
become
modified
still
farther
and
to
assume
the
form
of
an
ornamental
leaf
or
scroll
or
even
a
butterfly
while
in
some
cases
it
will
become
extinct
on
my
return
to
england
i
looked
up
the
point
and
found
that
my
friend
was
right
returning
however
to
the
treatise
my
translation
recommences
as
follows
may
we
not
fancy
that
if
in
the
remotest
geological
period
some
early
form
of
vegetable
life
had
been
endowed
with
the
power
of
reflecting
upon
the
dawning
life
of
animals
which
was
coming
into
existence
alongside
of
its
own
it
would
have
thought
itself
exceedingly
acute
if
it
had
surmised
that
animals
would
one
day
become
real
vegetables
yet
would
this
be
more
mistaken
than
it
would
be
on
our
part
to
imagine
that
because
the
life
of
machines
is
a
very
different
one
to
our
own
there
is
therefore
no
higher
possible
development
of
life
than
ours
or
that
because
mechanical
life
is
a
very
different
thing
from
ours
therefore
that
it
is
not
life
at
all
but
i
have
heard
it
said
that
this
is
so
and
that
the
engine
has
a
strength
of
its
own
surely
no
one
will
say
that
it
has
a
will
of
its
own
alas
if
we
look
more
closely
we
shall
find
that
this
does
not
make
against
the
supposition
that
the
is
one
of
the
germs
of
a
new
phase
of
life
what
is
there
in
this
whole
world
or
in
the
worlds
beyond
it
which
has
a
will
of
its
own
the
unknown
and
unknowable
only
a
man
is
the
resultant
and
exponent
of
all
the
forces
that
have
been
brought
to
bear
upon
him
whether
before
his
birth
or
afterwards
his
action
at
any
moment
depends
solely
upon
his
constitution
and
on
the
intensity
and
direction
of
the
various
agencies
to
which
he
is
and
has
been
subjected
some
of
these
will
counteract
each
other
but
as
he
is
by
nature
and
as
he
has
been
acted
on
and
is
now
acted
on
from
without
so
will
he
do
as
certainly
and
regularly
as
though
he
were
a
machine
we
do
not
generally
admit
this
because
we
do
not
know
the
whole
nature
of
any
one
nor
the
whole
of
the
forces
that
act
upon
him
we
see
but
a
part
and
being
thus
unable
to
generalise
human
conduct
except
very
roughly
we
deny
that
it
is
subject
to
any
fixed
laws
at
all
and
ascribe
much
both
of
a
man
character
and
actions
to
chance
or
luck
or
fortune
but
these
are
only
words
whereby
we
escape
the
admission
of
our
own
ignorance
and
a
little
reflection
will
teach
us
that
the
most
daring
flight
of
the
imagination
or
the
most
subtle
exercise
of
the
reason
is
as
much
the
thing
that
must
arise
and
the
only
thing
that
can
by
any
possibility
arise
at
the
moment
of
its
arising
as
the
falling
of
a
dead
leaf
when
the
wind
shakes
it
from
the
tree
for
the
future
depends
upon
the
present
and
the
present
whose
existence
is
only
one
of
those
minor
compromises
of
which
human
life
is
full
for
it
lives
only
on
sufferance
of
the
past
and
future
depends
upon
the
past
and
the
past
is
unalterable
the
only
reason
why
we
can
not
see
the
future
as
plainly
as
the
past
is
because
we
know
too
little
of
the
actual
past
and
actual
present
these
things
are
too
great
for
us
otherwise
the
future
in
its
minutest
details
would
lie
spread
out
before
our
eyes
and
we
should
lose
our
sense
of
time
present
by
reason
of
the
clearness
with
which
we
should
see
the
past
and
future
perhaps
we
should
not
be
even
able
to
distinguish
time
at
all
but
that
is
foreign
what
we
do
know
is
that
the
more
the
past
and
present
are
known
the
more
the
future
can
be
predicted
and
that
no
one
dreams
of
doubting
the
fixity
of
the
future
in
cases
where
he
is
fully
cognisant
of
both
past
and
present
and
has
had
experience
of
the
consequences
that
followed
from
such
a
past
and
such
a
present
on
previous
occasions
he
perfectly
well
knows
what
will
happen
and
will
stake
his
whole
fortune
thereon
and
this
is
a
great
blessing
for
it
is
the
foundation
on
which
morality
and
science
are
built
the
assurance
that
the
future
is
no
arbitrary
and
changeable
thing
but
that
like
futures
will
invariably
follow
like
presents
is
the
groundwork
on
which
we
lay
all
our
plans
the
faith
on
which
we
do
every
conscious
action
of
our
lives
if
this
were
not
so
we
should
be
without
a
guide
we
should
have
no
confidence
in
acting
and
hence
we
should
never
act
for
there
would
be
no
knowing
that
the
results
which
will
follow
now
will
be
the
same
as
those
which
followed
before
who
would
plough
or
sow
if
he
disbelieved
in
the
fixity
of
the
future
who
would
throw
water
on
a
blazing
house
if
the
action
of
water
upon
fire
were
uncertain
men
will
only
do
their
utmost
when
they
feel
certain
that
the
future
will
discover
itself
against
them
if
their
utmost
has
not
been
done
the
feeling
of
such
a
certainty
is
a
constituent
part
of
the
sum
of
the
forces
at
work
upon
them
and
will
act
most
powerfully
on
the
best
and
most
moral
men
those
who
are
most
firmly
persuaded
that
the
future
is
immutably
bound
up
with
the
present
in
which
their
work
is
lying
will
best
husband
their
present
and
till
it
with
the
greatest
care
the
future
must
be
a
lottery
to
those
who
think
that
the
same
combinations
can
sometimes
precede
one
set
of
results
and
sometimes
another
if
their
belief
is
sincere
they
will
speculate
instead
of
working
these
ought
to
be
the
immoral
men
the
others
have
the
strongest
spur
to
exertion
and
morality
if
their
belief
is
a
living
one
the
bearing
of
all
this
upon
the
machines
is
not
immediately
apparent
but
will
become
so
presently
in
the
meantime
i
must
deal
with
friends
who
tell
me
that
though
the
future
is
fixed
as
regards
inorganic
matter
and
in
some
respects
with
regard
to
man
yet
that
there
are
many
ways
in
which
it
can
not
be
considered
as
fixed
thus
they
say
that
fire
applied
to
dry
shavings
and
well
fed
with
oxygen
gas
will
always
produce
a
blaze
but
that
a
coward
brought
into
contact
with
a
terrifying
object
will
not
always
result
in
a
man
running
away
nevertheless
if
there
be
two
cowards
perfectly
similar
in
every
respect
and
if
they
be
subjected
in
a
perfectly
similar
way
to
two
terrifying
agents
which
are
themselves
perfectly
similar
there
are
few
who
will
not
expect
a
perfect
similarity
in
the
running
away
even
though
a
thousand
years
intervene
between
the
original
combination
and
its
being
repeated
the
apparently
greater
regularity
in
the
results
of
chemical
than
of
human
combinations
arises
from
our
inability
to
perceive
the
subtle
differences
in
human
combinations
combinations
which
are
never
identically
repeated
fire
we
know
and
shavings
we
know
but
no
two
men
ever
were
or
ever
will
be
exactly
alike
and
the
smallest
difference
may
change
the
whole
conditions
of
the
problem
our
registry
of
results
must
be
infinite
before
we
could
arrive
at
a
full
forecast
of
future
combinations
the
wonder
is
that
there
is
as
much
certainty
concerning
human
action
as
there
is
and
assuredly
the
older
we
grow
the
more
certain
we
feel
as
to
what
such
and
such
a
kind
of
person
will
do
in
given
circumstances
but
this
could
never
be
the
case
unless
human
conduct
were
under
the
influence
of
laws
with
the
working
of
which
we
become
more
and
more
familiar
through
experience
if
the
above
is
sound
it
follows
that
the
regularity
with
which
machinery
acts
is
no
proof
of
the
absence
of
vitality
or
at
least
of
germs
which
may
be
developed
into
a
new
phase
of
life
at
first
sight
it
would
indeed
appear
that
a
can
not
help
going
when
set
upon
a
line
of
rails
with
the
steam
up
and
the
machinery
in
full
play
whereas
the
man
whose
business
it
is
to
drive
it
can
help
doing
so
at
any
moment
that
he
pleases
so
that
the
first
has
no
spontaneity
and
is
not
possessed
of
any
sort
of
free
will
while
the
second
has
and
is
this
is
true
up
to
a
certain
point
the
driver
can
stop
the
engine
at
any
moment
that
he
pleases
but
he
can
only
please
to
do
so
at
certain
points
which
have
been
fixed
for
him
by
others
or
in
the
case
of
unexpected
obstructions
which
force
him
to
please
to
do
so
his
pleasure
is
not
spontaneous
there
is
an
unseen
choir
of
influences
around
him
which
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
act
in
any
other
way
than
one
it
is
known
beforehand
how
much
strength
must
be
given
to
these
influences
just
as
it
is
known
beforehand
how
much
coal
and
water
are
necessary
for
the
itself
and
curiously
enough
it
will
be
found
that
the
influences
brought
to
bear
upon
the
driver
are
of
the
same
kind
as
those
brought
to
bear
upon
the
engine
that
is
to
say
food
and
warmth
the
driver
is
obedient
to
his
masters
because
he
gets
food
and
warmth
from
them
and
if
these
are
withheld
or
given
in
insufficient
quantities
he
will
cease
to
drive
in
like
manner
the
engine
will
cease
to
work
if
it
is
insufficiently
fed
the
only
difference
is
that
the
man
is
conscious
about
his
wants
and
the
engine
beyond
refusing
to
work
does
not
seem
to
be
so
but
this
is
temporary
and
has
been
dealt
with
above
accordingly
the
requisite
strength
being
given
to
the
motives
that
are
to
drive
the
driver
there
has
never
or
hardly
ever
been
an
instance
of
a
man
stopping
his
engine
through
wantonness
but
such
a
case
might
occur
yes
and
it
might
occur
that
the
engine
should
break
down
but
if
the
train
is
stopped
from
some
trivial
motive
it
will
be
found
either
that
the
strength
of
the
necessary
influences
has
been
miscalculated
or
that
the
man
has
been
miscalculated
in
the
same
way
as
an
engine
may
break
down
from
an
unsuspected
flaw
but
even
in
such
a
case
there
will
have
been
no
spontaneity
the
action
will
have
had
its
true
parental
causes
spontaneity
is
only
a
term
for
man
ignorance
of
the
gods
is
there
then
no
spontaneity
on
the
part
of
those
who
drive
the
driver
here
followed
an
obscure
argument
upon
this
subject
which
i
have
thought
it
best
to
omit
the
writer
resumes
after
all
then
it
comes
to
this
that
the
difference
between
the
life
of
a
man
and
that
of
a
machine
is
one
rather
of
degree
than
of
kind
though
differences
in
kind
are
not
wanting
an
animal
has
more
provision
for
emergency
than
a
machine
the
machine
is
less
versatile
its
range
of
action
is
narrow
its
strength
and
accuracy
in
its
own
sphere
are
superhuman
but
it
shows
badly
in
a
dilemma
sometimes
when
its
normal
action
is
disturbed
it
will
lose
its
head
and
go
from
bad
to
worse
like
a
lunatic
in
a
raging
frenzy
but
here
again
we
are
met
by
the
same
consideration
as
before
namely
that
the
machines
are
still
in
their
infancy
they
are
mere
skeletons
without
muscles
and
flesh
for
how
many
emergencies
is
an
oyster
adapted
for
as
many
as
are
likely
to
happen
to
it
and
no
more
so
are
the
machines
and
so
is
man
himself
the
list
of
casualties
that
daily
occur
to
man
through
his
want
of
adaptability
is
probably
as
great
as
that
occurring
to
the
machines
and
every
day
gives
them
some
greater
provision
for
the
unforeseen
let
any
one
examine
the
wonderful
and
contrivances
which
are
now
incorporated
with
the
let
him
watch
the
way
in
which
it
supplies
itself
with
oil
in
which
it
indicates
its
wants
to
those
who
tend
it
in
which
by
the
governor
it
regulates
its
application
of
its
own
strength
let
him
look
at
that
of
inertia
and
momentum
the
or
at
the
buffers
on
a
railway
carriage
let
him
see
how
those
improvements
are
being
selected
for
perpetuity
which
contain
provision
against
the
emergencies
that
may
arise
to
harass
the
machines
and
then
let
him
think
of
a
hundred
thousand
years
and
the
accumulated
progress
which
they
will
bring
unless
man
can
be
awakened
to
a
sense
of
his
situation
and
of
the
doom
which
he
is
preparing
for
himself
the
misery
is
that
man
has
been
blind
so
long
already
in
his
reliance
upon
the
use
of
steam
he
has
been
betrayed
into
increasing
and
multiplying
to
withdraw
steam
power
suddenly
will
not
have
the
effect
of
reducing
us
to
the
state
in
which
we
were
before
its
introduction
there
will
be
a
general
and
time
of
anarchy
such
as
has
never
been
known
it
will
be
as
though
our
population
were
suddenly
doubled
with
no
additional
means
of
feeding
the
increased
number
the
air
we
breathe
is
hardly
more
necessary
for
our
animal
life
than
the
use
of
any
machine
on
the
strength
of
which
we
have
increased
our
numbers
is
to
our
civilisation
it
is
the
machines
which
act
upon
man
and
make
him
man
as
much
as
man
who
has
acted
upon
and
made
the
machines
but
we
must
choose
between
the
alternative
of
undergoing
much
present
suffering
or
seeing
ourselves
gradually
superseded
by
our
own
creatures
till
we
rank
no
higher
in
comparison
with
them
than
the
beasts
of
the
field
with
ourselves
herein
lies
our
danger
for
many
seem
inclined
to
acquiesce
in
so
dishonourable
a
future
they
say
that
although
man
should
become
to
the
machines
what
the
horse
and
dog
are
to
us
yet
that
he
will
continue
to
exist
and
will
probably
be
better
off
in
a
state
of
domestication
under
the
beneficent
rule
of
the
machines
than
in
his
present
wild
condition
we
treat
our
domestic
animals
with
much
kindness
we
give
them
whatever
we
believe
to
be
the
best
for
them
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
our
use
of
meat
has
increased
their
happiness
rather
than
detracted
from
it
in
like
manner
there
is
reason
to
hope
that
the
machines
will
use
us
kindly
for
their
existence
will
be
in
a
great
measure
dependent
upon
ours
they
will
rule
us
with
a
rod
of
iron
but
they
will
not
eat
us
they
will
not
only
require
our
services
in
the
reproduction
and
education
of
their
young
but
also
in
waiting
upon
them
as
servants
in
gathering
food
for
them
and
feeding
them
in
restoring
them
to
health
when
they
are
sick
and
in
either
burying
their
dead
or
working
up
their
deceased
members
into
new
forms
of
mechanical
existence
the
very
nature
of
the
motive
power
which
works
the
advancement
of
the
machines
precludes
the
possibility
of
man
life
being
rendered
miserable
as
well
as
enslaved
slaves
are
tolerably
happy
if
they
have
good
masters
and
the
revolution
will
not
occur
in
our
time
nor
hardly
in
ten
thousand
years
or
ten
times
that
is
it
wise
to
be
uneasy
about
a
contingency
which
is
so
remote
man
is
not
a
sentimental
animal
where
his
material
interests
are
concerned
and
though
here
and
there
some
ardent
soul
may
look
upon
himself
and
curse
his
fate
that
he
was
not
born
a
yet
the
mass
of
mankind
will
acquiesce
in
any
arrangement
which
gives
them
better
food
and
clothing
at
a
cheaper
rate
and
will
refrain
from
yielding
to
unreasonable
jealousy
merely
because
there
are
other
destinies
more
glorious
than
their
own
the
power
of
custom
is
enormous
and
so
gradual
will
be
the
change
that
man
sense
of
what
is
due
to
himself
will
be
at
no
time
rudely
shocked
our
bondage
will
steal
upon
us
noiselessly
and
by
imperceptible
approaches
nor
will
there
ever
be
such
a
clashing
of
desires
between
man
and
the
machines
as
will
lead
to
an
encounter
between
them
among
themselves
the
machines
will
war
eternally
but
they
will
still
require
man
as
the
being
through
whose
agency
the
struggle
will
be
principally
conducted
in
point
of
fact
there
is
no
occasion
for
anxiety
about
the
future
happiness
of
man
so
long
as
he
continues
to
be
in
any
way
profitable
to
the
machines
he
may
become
the
inferior
race
but
he
will
be
infinitely
better
off
than
he
is
now
is
it
not
then
both
absurd
and
unreasonable
to
be
envious
of
our
benefactors
and
should
we
not
be
guilty
of
consummate
folly
if
we
were
to
reject
advantages
which
we
can
not
obtain
otherwise
merely
because
they
involve
a
greater
gain
to
others
than
to
ourselves
with
those
who
can
argue
in
this
way
i
have
nothing
in
common
i
shrink
with
as
much
horror
from
believing
that
my
race
can
ever
be
superseded
or
surpassed
as
i
should
do
from
believing
that
even
at
the
remotest
period
my
ancestors
were
other
than
human
beings
could
i
believe
that
ten
hundred
thousand
years
ago
a
single
one
of
my
ancestors
was
another
kind
of
being
to
myself
i
should
lose
all
and
take
no
further
pleasure
or
interest
in
life
i
have
the
same
feeling
with
regard
to
my
descendants
and
believe
it
to
be
one
that
will
be
felt
so
generally
that
the
country
will
resolve
upon
putting
an
immediate
stop
to
all
further
mechanical
progress
and
upon
destroying
all
improvements
that
have
been
made
for
the
last
three
hundred
years
i
would
not
urge
more
than
this
we
may
trust
ourselves
to
deal
with
those
that
remain
and
though
i
should
prefer
to
have
seen
the
destruction
include
another
two
hundred
years
i
am
aware
of
the
necessity
for
compromising
and
would
so
far
sacrifice
my
own
individual
convictions
as
to
be
content
with
three
hundred
less
than
this
will
be
insufficient
this
was
the
conclusion
of
the
attack
which
led
to
the
destruction
of
machinery
throughout
erewhon
there
was
only
one
serious
attempt
to
answer
it
its
author
said
that
machines
were
to
be
regarded
as
a
part
of
man
own
physical
nature
being
really
nothing
but
limbs
man
he
said
was
a
machinate
mammal
the
lower
animals
keep
all
their
limbs
at
home
in
their
own
bodies
but
many
of
man
are
loose
and
lie
about
detached
now
here
and
now
there
in
various
parts
of
the
world
some
being
kept
always
handy
for
contingent
use
and
others
being
occasionally
hundreds
of
miles
away
a
machine
is
merely
a
supplementary
limb
this
is
the
be
all
and
end
all
of
machinery
we
do
not
use
our
own
limbs
other
than
as
machines
and
a
leg
is
only
a
much
better
wooden
leg
than
any
one
can
manufacture
observe
a
man
digging
with
a
spade
his
right
has
become
artificially
lengthened
and
his
hand
has
become
a
joint
the
handle
of
the
spade
is
like
the
knob
at
the
end
of
the
humerus
the
shaft
is
the
additional
bone
and
the
oblong
iron
plate
is
the
new
form
of
the
hand
which
enables
its
possessor
to
disturb
the
earth
in
a
way
to
which
his
original
hand
was
unequal
having
thus
modified
himself
not
as
other
animals
are
modified
by
circumstances
over
which
they
have
had
not
even
the
appearance
of
control
but
having
as
it
were
taken
forethought
and
added
a
cubit
to
his
stature
civilisation
began
to
dawn
upon
the
race
the
social
good
offices
the
genial
companionship
of
friends
the
art
of
unreason
and
all
those
habits
of
mind
which
most
elevate
man
above
the
lower
animals
in
the
course
of
time
ensued
thus
civilisation
and
mechanical
progress
advanced
hand
in
hand
each
developing
and
being
developed
by
the
other
the
earliest
accidental
use
of
the
stick
having
set
the
ball
rolling
and
the
prospect
of
advantage
keeping
it
in
motion
in
fact
machines
are
to
be
regarded
as
the
mode
of
development
by
which
human
organism
is
now
especially
advancing
every
past
invention
being
an
addition
to
the
resources
of
the
human
body
even
community
of
limbs
is
thus
rendered
possible
to
those
who
have
so
much
community
of
soul
as
to
own
money
enough
to
pay
a
railway
fare
for
a
train
is
only
a
foot
that
five
hundred
may
own
at
once
the
one
serious
danger
which
this
writer
apprehended
was
that
the
machines
would
so
equalise
men
powers
and
so
lessen
the
severity
of
competition
that
many
persons
of
inferior
physique
would
escape
detection
and
transmit
their
inferiority
to
their
descendants
he
feared
that
the
removal
of
the
present
pressure
might
cause
a
degeneracy
of
the
human
race
and
indeed
that
the
whole
body
might
become
purely
rudimentary
the
man
himself
being
nothing
but
soul
and
mechanism
an
intelligent
but
passionless
principle
of
mechanical
action
how
greatly
he
wrote
do
we
not
now
live
with
our
external
limbs
we
vary
our
physique
with
the
seasons
with
age
with
advancing
or
decreasing
wealth
if
it
is
wet
we
are
furnished
with
an
organ
commonly
called
an
umbrella
and
which
is
designed
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
our
clothes
or
our
skins
from
the
injurious
effects
of
rain
man
has
now
many
members
which
are
of
more
importance
to
him
than
a
good
deal
of
his
hair
or
at
any
rate
than
his
whiskers
his
memory
goes
in
his
he
becomes
more
and
more
complex
as
he
grows
older
he
will
then
be
seen
with
or
perhaps
with
artificial
teeth
and
hair
if
he
be
a
really
specimen
of
his
race
he
will
be
furnished
with
a
large
box
upon
wheels
two
horses
and
a
coachman
it
was
this
writer
who
originated
the
custom
of
classifying
men
by
their
and
who
divided
them
into
genera
species
varieties
and
subvarieties
giving
them
names
from
the
hypothetical
language
which
expressed
the
number
of
limbs
which
they
could
command
at
any
moment
he
showed
that
men
became
more
highly
and
delicately
organised
the
more
nearly
they
approached
the
summit
of
opulence
and
that
none
but
millionaires
possessed
the
full
complement
of
limbs
with
which
mankind
could
become
incorporate
those
mighty
organisms
he
continued
our
leading
bankers
and
merchants
speak
to
their
congeners
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
in
a
second
of
time
their
rich
and
subtle
souls
can
defy
all
material
impediment
whereas
the
souls
of
the
poor
are
clogged
and
hampered
by
matter
which
sticks
fast
about
them
as
treacle
to
the
wings
of
a
fly
or
as
one
struggling
in
a
quicksand
their
dull
ears
must
take
days
or
weeks
to
hear
what
another
would
tell
them
from
a
distance
instead
of
hearing
it
in
a
second
as
is
done
by
the
more
highly
organised
classes
who
shall
deny
that
one
who
can
tack
on
a
special
train
to
his
identity
and
go
wheresoever
he
will
whensoever
he
pleases
is
more
highly
organised
than
he
who
should
he
wish
for
the
same
power
might
wish
for
the
wings
of
a
bird
with
an
equal
chance
of
getting
them
and
whose
legs
are
his
only
means
of
locomotion
that
old
philosophic
enemy
matter
the
inherently
and
essentially
evil
still
hangs
about
the
neck
of
the
poor
and
strangles
him
but
to
the
rich
matter
is
immaterial
the
elaborate
organisation
of
his
system
has
freed
his
soul
this
is
the
secret
of
the
homage
which
we
see
rich
men
receive
from
those
who
are
poorer
than
themselves
it
would
be
a
grave
error
to
suppose
that
this
deference
proceeds
from
motives
which
we
need
be
ashamed
of
it
is
the
natural
respect
which
all
living
creatures
pay
to
those
whom
they
recognise
as
higher
than
themselves
in
the
scale
of
animal
life
and
is
analogous
to
the
veneration
which
a
dog
feels
for
man
among
savage
races
it
is
deemed
highly
honourable
to
be
the
possessor
of
a
gun
and
throughout
all
known
time
there
has
been
a
feeling
that
those
who
are
worth
most
are
the
worthiest
and
so
he
went
on
at
considerable
length
attempting
to
show
what
changes
in
the
distribution
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
throughout
the
kingdom
had
been
caused
by
this
and
that
of
man
inventions
and
in
what
way
each
was
connected
with
the
moral
and
intellectual
development
of
the
human
species
he
even
allotted
to
some
the
share
which
they
had
had
in
the
creation
and
modification
of
man
body
and
that
which
they
would
hereafter
have
in
its
destruction
but
the
other
writer
was
considered
to
have
the
best
of
it
and
in
the
end
succeeded
in
destroying
all
the
inventions
that
had
been
discovered
for
the
preceding
years
a
period
which
was
agreed
upon
by
all
parties
after
several
years
of
wrangling
as
to
whether
a
certain
kind
of
mangle
which
was
much
in
use
among
washerwomen
should
be
saved
or
no
it
was
at
last
ruled
to
be
dangerous
and
was
just
excluded
by
the
limit
of
years
then
came
the
reactionary
civil
wars
which
nearly
ruined
the
country
but
which
it
would
be
beyond
my
present
scope
to
describe
chapter
xxvi
the
views
of
an
erewhonian
prophet
concerning
the
rights
of
animals
it
will
be
seen
from
the
foregoing
chapters
that
the
erewhonians
are
a
meek
and
people
easily
led
by
the
nose
and
quick
to
offer
up
common
sense
at
the
shrine
of
logic
when
a
philosopher
arises
among
them
who
carries
them
away
through
his
reputation
for
especial
learning
or
by
convincing
them
that
their
existing
institutions
are
not
based
on
the
strictest
principles
of
morality
the
series
of
revolutions
on
which
i
shall
now
briefly
touch
shows
this
even
more
plainly
than
the
way
already
dealt
with
in
which
at
a
later
date
they
cut
their
throats
in
the
matter
of
machinery
for
if
the
second
of
the
two
reformers
of
whom
i
am
about
to
speak
had
had
his
way
or
rather
the
way
that
he
professed
to
have
the
whole
race
would
have
died
of
starvation
within
a
happily
common
sense
though
she
is
by
nature
the
gentlest
creature
living
when
she
feels
the
knife
at
her
throat
is
apt
to
develop
unexpected
powers
of
resistance
and
to
send
doctrinaires
flying
even
when
they
have
bound
her
down
and
think
they
have
her
at
their
mercy
what
happened
so
far
as
i
could
collect
it
from
the
best
authorities
was
as
follows
some
two
thousand
five
hundred
years
ago
the
erewhonians
were
still
uncivilised
and
lived
by
hunting
fishing
a
rude
system
of
agriculture
and
plundering
such
few
other
nations
as
they
had
not
yet
completely
conquered
they
had
no
schools
or
systems
of
philosophy
but
by
a
kind
of
did
that
which
was
right
in
their
own
eyes
and
in
those
of
their
neighbours
the
common
sense
therefore
of
the
public
being
as
yet
unvitiated
crime
and
disease
were
looked
upon
much
as
they
are
in
other
countries
but
with
the
gradual
advance
of
civilisation
and
increase
in
material
prosperity
people
began
to
ask
questions
about
things
that
they
had
hitherto
taken
as
matters
of
course
and
one
old
gentleman
who
had
great
influence
over
them
by
reason
of
the
sanctity
of
his
life
and
his
supposed
inspiration
by
an
unseen
power
whose
existence
was
now
beginning
to
be
felt
took
it
into
his
head
to
disquiet
himself
about
the
rights
of
animals
a
question
that
so
far
had
disturbed
nobody
all
prophets
are
more
or
less
fussy
and
this
old
gentleman
seems
to
have
been
one
of
the
more
fussy
ones
being
maintained
at
the
public
expense
he
had
ample
leisure
and
not
content
with
limiting
his
attention
to
the
rights
of
animals
he
wanted
to
reduce
right
and
wrong
to
rules
to
consider
the
foundations
of
duty
and
of
good
and
evil
and
otherwise
to
put
all
sorts
of
matters
on
a
logical
basis
which
people
whose
time
is
money
are
content
to
accept
on
no
basis
at
all
as
a
matter
of
course
the
basis
on
which
he
decided
that
duty
could
alone
rest
was
one
that
afforded
no
for
many
of
the
established
habits
of
the
people
these
he
assured
them
were
all
wrong
and
whenever
any
one
ventured
to
differ
from
him
he
referred
the
matter
to
the
unseen
power
with
which
he
alone
was
in
direct
communication
and
the
unseen
power
invariably
assured
him
that
he
was
right
as
regards
the
rights
of
animals
he
taught
as
follows
you
know
he
said
how
wicked
it
is
of
you
to
kill
one
another
once
upon
a
time
your
made
no
scruple
about
not
only
killing
but
also
eating
their
relations
no
one
would
now
go
back
to
such
detestable
practices
for
it
is
notorious
that
we
have
lived
much
more
happily
since
they
were
abandoned
from
this
increased
prosperity
we
may
confidently
deduce
the
maxim
that
we
should
not
kill
and
eat
our
i
have
consulted
the
higher
power
by
whom
you
know
that
i
am
inspired
and
he
has
assured
me
that
this
conclusion
is
irrefragable
now
it
can
not
be
denied
that
sheep
cattle
deer
birds
and
fishes
are
our
they
differ
from
us
in
some
respects
but
those
in
which
they
differ
are
few
and
secondary
while
those
that
they
have
in
common
with
us
are
many
and
essential
my
friends
if
it
was
wrong
of
you
to
kill
and
eat
your
it
is
wrong
also
to
kill
and
eat
fish
flesh
and
fowl
birds
beasts
and
fishes
have
as
full
a
right
to
live
as
long
as
they
can
unmolested
by
man
as
man
has
to
live
unmolested
by
his
neighbours
these
words
let
me
again
assure
you
are
not
mine
but
those
of
the
higher
power
which
inspires
me
i
grant
he
continued
that
animals
molest
one
another
and
that
some
of
them
go
so
far
as
to
molest
man
but
i
have
yet
to
learn
that
we
should
model
our
conduct
on
that
of
the
lower
animals
we
should
endeavour
rather
to
instruct
them
and
bring
them
to
a
better
mind
to
kill
a
tiger
for
example
who
has
lived
on
the
flesh
of
men
and
women
whom
he
has
killed
is
to
reduce
ourselves
to
the
level
of
the
tiger
and
is
unworthy
of
people
who
seek
to
be
guided
by
the
highest
principles
in
all
both
their
thoughts
and
actions
the
unseen
power
who
has
revealed
himself
to
me
alone
among
you
has
told
me
to
tell
you
that
you
ought
by
this
time
to
have
outgrown
the
barbarous
habits
of
your
ancestors
if
as
you
believe
you
know
better
than
they
you
should
do
better
he
commands
you
therefore
to
refrain
from
killing
any
living
being
for
the
sake
of
eating
it
the
only
animal
food
that
you
may
eat
is
the
flesh
of
any
birds
beasts
or
fishes
that
you
may
come
upon
as
having
died
a
natural
death
or
any
that
may
have
been
born
prematurely
or
so
deformed
that
it
is
a
mercy
to
put
them
out
of
their
pain
you
may
also
eat
all
such
animals
as
have
committed
suicide
as
regards
vegetables
you
may
eat
all
those
that
will
let
you
eat
them
with
impunity
so
wisely
and
so
well
did
the
old
prophet
argue
and
so
terrible
were
the
threats
he
hurled
at
those
who
should
disobey
him
that
in
the
end
he
carried
the
more
highly
educated
part
of
the
people
with
him
and
presently
the
poorer
classes
followed
suit
or
professed
to
do
so
having
seen
the
triumph
of
his
principles
he
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
and
no
doubt
entered
at
once
into
full
communion
with
that
unseen
power
whose
favour
he
had
already
so
enjoyed
he
had
not
however
been
dead
very
long
before
some
of
his
more
ardent
disciples
took
it
upon
them
to
better
the
instruction
of
their
master
the
old
prophet
had
allowed
the
use
of
eggs
and
milk
but
his
disciples
decided
that
to
eat
a
fresh
egg
was
to
destroy
a
potential
chicken
and
that
this
came
to
much
the
same
as
murdering
a
live
one
stale
eggs
if
it
was
quite
certain
that
they
were
too
far
gone
to
be
able
to
be
hatched
were
grudgingly
permitted
but
all
eggs
offered
for
sale
had
to
be
submitted
to
an
inspector
who
on
being
satisfied
that
they
were
addled
would
label
them
laid
not
less
than
three
months
from
the
date
whatever
it
might
happen
to
be
these
eggs
i
need
hardly
say
were
only
used
in
puddings
and
as
a
medicine
in
certain
cases
where
an
emetic
was
urgently
required
milk
was
forbidden
inasmuch
as
it
could
not
be
obtained
without
robbing
some
calf
of
its
natural
sustenance
and
thus
endangering
its
life
it
will
be
easily
believed
that
at
first
there
were
many
who
gave
the
new
rules
outward
observance
but
embraced
every
opportunity
of
indulging
secretly
in
those
to
which
they
had
been
accustomed
it
was
found
that
animals
were
continually
dying
natural
deaths
under
more
or
less
suspicious
circumstances
suicidal
mania
again
which
had
hitherto
been
confined
exclusively
to
donkeys
became
alarmingly
prevalent
even
among
such
for
the
most
part
creatures
as
sheep
and
cattle
it
was
astonishing
how
some
of
these
unfortunate
animals
would
scent
out
a
butcher
knife
if
there
was
one
within
a
mile
of
them
and
run
right
up
against
it
if
the
butcher
did
not
get
it
out
of
their
way
in
time
dogs
again
that
had
been
quite
as
regards
domestic
poultry
tame
rabbits
sucking
pigs
or
sheep
and
lambs
suddenly
took
to
breaking
beyond
the
control
of
their
masters
and
killing
anything
that
they
were
told
not
to
touch
it
was
held
that
any
animal
killed
by
a
dog
had
died
a
natural
death
for
it
was
the
dog
nature
to
kill
things
and
he
had
only
refrained
from
molesting
farmyard
creatures
hitherto
because
his
nature
had
been
tampered
with
unfortunately
the
more
these
unruly
tendencies
became
developed
the
more
the
common
people
seemed
to
delight
in
breeding
the
very
animals
that
would
put
temptation
in
the
dog
way
there
is
little
doubt
in
fact
that
they
were
deliberately
evading
the
law
but
whether
this
was
so
or
no
they
sold
or
ate
everything
their
dogs
had
killed
evasion
was
more
difficult
in
the
case
of
the
larger
animals
for
the
magistrates
could
not
wink
at
all
the
pretended
suicides
of
pigs
sheep
and
cattle
that
were
brought
before
them
sometimes
they
had
to
convict
and
a
few
convictions
had
a
very
terrorising
effect
whereas
in
the
case
of
animals
killed
by
a
dog
the
marks
of
the
dog
teeth
could
be
seen
and
it
was
practically
impossible
to
prove
malice
on
the
part
of
the
owner
of
the
dog
another
fertile
source
of
disobedience
to
the
law
was
furnished
by
a
decision
of
one
of
the
judges
that
raised
a
great
outcry
among
the
more
fervent
disciples
of
the
old
prophet
the
judge
held
that
it
was
lawful
to
kill
any
animal
in
and
that
such
conduct
was
so
natural
on
the
part
of
a
man
who
found
himself
attacked
that
the
attacking
creature
should
be
held
to
have
died
a
natural
death
the
high
vegetarians
had
indeed
good
reason
to
be
alarmed
for
hardly
had
this
decision
become
generally
known
before
a
number
of
animals
hitherto
harmless
took
to
attacking
their
owners
with
such
ferocity
that
it
became
necessary
to
put
them
to
a
natural
death
again
it
was
quite
common
at
that
time
to
see
the
carcase
of
a
calf
lamb
or
kid
exposed
for
sale
with
a
label
from
the
inspector
certifying
that
it
had
been
killed
in
sometimes
even
the
carcase
of
a
lamb
or
calf
was
exposed
as
warranted
when
it
presented
every
appearance
of
having
enjoyed
at
least
a
month
of
life
as
for
the
flesh
of
animals
that
had
died
a
natural
death
the
permission
to
eat
it
was
nugatory
for
it
was
generally
eaten
by
some
other
animal
before
man
got
hold
of
it
or
failing
this
it
was
often
poisonous
so
that
practically
people
were
forced
to
evade
the
law
by
some
of
the
means
above
spoken
of
or
to
become
vegetarians
this
last
alternative
was
so
little
to
the
taste
of
the
erewhonians
that
the
laws
against
killing
animals
were
falling
into
desuetude
and
would
very
likely
have
been
repealed
but
for
the
breaking
out
of
a
pestilence
which
was
ascribed
by
the
priests
and
prophets
of
the
day
to
the
lawlessness
of
the
people
in
the
matter
of
eating
forbidden
flesh
on
this
there
was
a
reaction
stringent
laws
were
passed
forbidding
the
use
of
meat
in
any
form
or
shape
and
permitting
no
food
but
grain
fruits
and
vegetables
to
be
sold
in
shops
and
markets
these
laws
were
enacted
about
two
hundred
years
after
the
death
of
the
old
prophet
who
had
first
unsettled
people
minds
about
the
rights
of
animals
but
they
had
hardly
been
passed
before
people
again
began
to
break
them
i
was
told
that
the
most
painful
consequence
of
all
this
folly
did
not
lie
in
the
fact
that
people
had
to
go
without
animal
food
many
nations
do
this
and
seem
none
the
worse
and
even
in
eating
countries
such
as
italy
spain
and
greece
the
poor
seldom
see
meat
from
year
end
to
year
end
the
mischief
lay
in
the
jar
which
undue
prohibition
gave
to
the
consciences
of
all
but
those
who
were
strong
enough
to
know
that
though
conscience
as
a
rule
boons
it
can
also
bane
the
awakened
conscience
of
an
individual
will
often
lead
him
to
do
things
in
haste
that
he
had
better
have
left
undone
but
the
conscience
of
a
nation
awakened
by
a
respectable
old
gentleman
who
has
an
unseen
power
up
his
sleeve
will
pave
hell
with
a
vengeance
young
people
were
told
that
it
was
a
sin
to
do
what
their
fathers
had
done
unhurt
for
centuries
those
moreover
who
preached
to
them
about
the
enormity
of
eating
meat
were
an
unattractive
academic
folk
and
though
they
all
but
the
bolder
youths
there
were
few
who
did
not
in
their
hearts
dislike
them
however
much
the
young
person
might
be
shielded
he
soon
got
to
know
that
men
and
women
of
the
world
often
far
nicer
people
than
the
prophets
who
preached
abstention
continually
spoke
sneeringly
of
the
new
doctrinaire
laws
and
were
believed
to
set
them
aside
in
secret
though
they
dared
not
do
so
openly
small
wonder
then
that
the
more
human
among
the
student
classes
were
provoked
by
the
not
precepts
of
their
rulers
into
questioning
much
that
they
would
otherwise
have
unhesitatingly
accepted
one
sad
story
is
on
record
about
a
young
man
of
promising
amiable
disposition
but
cursed
with
more
conscience
than
brains
who
had
been
told
by
his
doctor
for
as
i
have
above
said
disease
was
not
yet
held
to
be
criminal
that
he
ought
to
eat
meat
law
or
no
law
he
was
much
shocked
and
for
some
time
refused
to
comply
with
what
he
deemed
the
unrighteous
advice
given
him
by
his
doctor
at
last
however
finding
that
he
grew
weaker
and
weaker
he
stole
secretly
on
a
dark
night
into
one
of
those
dens
in
which
meat
was
surreptitiously
sold
and
bought
a
pound
of
prime
steak
he
took
it
home
cooked
it
in
his
bedroom
when
every
one
in
the
house
had
gone
to
rest
ate
it
and
though
he
could
hardly
sleep
for
remorse
and
shame
felt
so
much
better
next
morning
that
he
hardly
knew
himself
three
or
four
days
later
he
again
found
himself
irresistibly
drawn
to
this
same
den
again
he
bought
a
pound
of
steak
again
he
cooked
and
ate
it
and
again
in
spite
of
much
mental
torture
on
the
following
morning
felt
himself
a
different
man
to
cut
the
story
short
though
he
never
went
beyond
the
bounds
of
moderation
it
preyed
upon
his
mind
that
he
should
be
drifting
as
he
certainly
was
into
the
ranks
of
the
habitual
all
the
time
his
health
kept
on
improving
and
though
he
felt
sure
that
he
owed
this
to
the
beefsteaks
the
better
he
became
in
body
the
more
his
conscience
gave
him
no
rest
two
voices
were
for
ever
ringing
in
his
ears
the
one
saying
i
am
common
sense
and
nature
heed
me
and
i
will
reward
you
as
i
rewarded
your
fathers
before
you
but
the
other
voice
said
let
not
that
plausible
spirit
lure
you
to
your
ruin
i
am
duty
heed
me
and
i
will
reward
you
as
i
rewarded
your
fathers
before
you
sometimes
he
even
seemed
to
see
the
faces
of
the
speakers
common
sense
looked
so
easy
genial
and
serene
so
frank
and
fearless
that
do
what
he
might
he
could
not
mistrust
her
but
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
following
her
he
would
be
checked
by
the
austere
face
of
duty
so
grave
but
yet
so
kindly
and
it
cut
him
to
the
heart
that
from
time
to
time
he
should
see
her
turn
pitying
away
from
him
as
he
followed
after
her
rival
the
poor
boy
continually
thought
of
the
better
class
of
his
and
tried
to
model
his
conduct
on
what
he
thought
was
theirs
they
he
said
to
himself
eat
a
beefsteak
never
but
they
most
of
them
ate
one
now
and
again
unless
it
was
a
mutton
chop
that
tempted
them
and
they
used
him
for
a
model
much
as
he
did
them
he
they
would
say
to
themselves
eat
a
mutton
chop
never
one
night
however
he
was
followed
by
one
of
the
authorities
who
was
always
prowling
about
in
search
of
and
was
caught
coming
out
of
the
den
with
half
a
shoulder
of
mutton
concealed
about
his
person
on
this
even
though
he
had
not
been
put
in
prison
he
would
have
been
sent
away
with
his
prospects
in
life
irretrievably
ruined
he
therefore
hanged
himself
as
soon
as
he
got
home
chapter
xxvii
the
views
of
an
erewhonian
philosopher
concerning
the
rights
of
vegetables
let
me
leave
this
unhappy
story
and
return
to
the
course
of
events
among
the
erewhonians
at
large
no
matter
how
many
laws
they
passed
increasing
the
severity
of
the
punishments
inflicted
on
those
who
ate
meat
in
secret
the
people
found
means
of
setting
them
aside
as
fast
as
they
were
made
at
times
indeed
they
would
become
almost
obsolete
but
when
they
were
on
the
point
of
being
repealed
some
national
disaster
or
the
preaching
of
some
fanatic
would
reawaken
the
conscience
of
the
nation
and
people
were
imprisoned
by
the
thousand
for
illicitly
selling
and
buying
animal
food
about
six
or
seven
hundred
years
however
after
the
death
of
the
old
prophet
a
philosopher
appeared
who
though
he
did
not
claim
to
have
any
communication
with
an
unseen
power
laid
down
the
law
with
as
much
confidence
as
if
such
a
power
had
inspired
him
many
think
that
this
philosopher
did
not
believe
his
own
teaching
and
being
in
secret
a
great
had
no
other
end
in
view
than
reducing
the
prohibition
against
eating
animal
food
to
an
absurdity
greater
even
than
an
erewhonian
puritan
would
be
able
to
stand
those
who
take
this
view
hold
that
he
knew
how
impossible
it
would
be
to
get
the
nation
to
accept
legislation
that
it
held
to
be
sinful
he
knew
also
how
hopeless
it
would
be
to
convince
people
that
it
was
not
wicked
to
kill
a
sheep
and
eat
it
unless
he
could
show
them
that
they
must
either
sin
to
a
certain
extent
or
die
he
therefore
it
is
believed
made
the
monstrous
proposals
of
which
i
will
now
speak
he
began
by
paying
a
tribute
of
profound
respect
to
the
old
prophet
whose
advocacy
of
the
rights
of
animals
he
admitted
had
done
much
to
soften
the
national
character
and
enlarge
its
views
about
the
sanctity
of
life
in
general
but
he
urged
that
times
had
now
changed
the
lesson
of
which
the
country
had
stood
in
need
had
been
sufficiently
learnt
while
as
regards
vegetables
much
had
become
known
that
was
not
even
suspected
formerly
and
which
if
the
nation
was
to
persevere
in
that
strict
adherence
to
the
highest
moral
principles
which
had
been
the
secret
of
its
prosperity
hitherto
must
necessitate
a
radical
change
in
its
attitude
towards
them
it
was
indeed
true
that
much
was
now
known
that
had
not
been
suspected
formerly
for
the
people
had
had
no
foreign
enemies
and
being
both
and
inquisitive
into
the
mysteries
of
nature
had
made
extraordinary
progress
in
all
the
many
branches
of
art
and
science
in
the
chief
erewhonian
museum
i
was
shown
a
microscope
of
considerable
power
that
was
ascribed
by
the
authorities
to
a
date
much
about
that
of
the
philosopher
of
whom
i
am
now
speaking
and
was
even
supposed
by
some
to
have
been
the
instrument
with
which
he
had
actually
worked
this
philosopher
was
professor
of
botany
in
the
chief
seat
of
learning
then
in
erewhon
and
whether
with
the
help
of
the
microscope
still
preserved
or
with
another
had
arrived
at
a
conclusion
now
universally
accepted
among
ourselves
i
mean
that
all
both
animals
and
plants
have
had
a
common
ancestry
and
that
hence
the
second
should
be
deemed
as
much
alive
as
the
first
he
contended
therefore
that
animals
and
plants
were
cousins
and
would
have
been
seen
to
be
so
all
along
if
people
had
not
made
an
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
division
between
what
they
chose
to
call
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
he
declared
and
demonstrated
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
those
who
were
able
to
form
an
opinion
upon
the
subject
that
there
is
no
difference
appreciable
either
by
the
eye
or
by
any
other
test
between
a
germ
that
will
develop
into
an
oak
a
vine
a
rose
and
one
that
given
its
accustomed
surroundings
will
become
a
mouse
an
elephant
or
a
man
he
contended
that
the
course
of
any
germ
development
was
dictated
by
the
habits
of
the
germs
from
which
it
was
descended
and
of
whose
identity
it
had
once
formed
part
if
a
germ
found
itself
placed
as
the
germs
in
the
line
of
its
ancestry
were
placed
it
would
do
as
its
ancestors
had
done
and
grow
up
into
the
same
kind
of
organism
as
theirs
if
it
found
the
circumstances
only
a
little
different
it
would
make
shift
successfully
or
unsuccessfully
to
modify
its
development
accordingly
if
the
circumstances
were
widely
different
it
would
die
probably
without
an
effort
at
this
he
argued
applied
equally
to
the
germs
of
plants
and
of
animals
he
therefore
connected
all
both
animal
and
vegetable
development
with
intelligence
either
spent
and
now
unconscious
or
still
unspent
and
conscious
and
in
support
of
his
view
as
regards
vegetable
life
he
pointed
to
the
way
in
which
all
plants
have
adapted
themselves
to
their
habitual
environment
granting
that
vegetable
intelligence
at
first
sight
appears
to
differ
materially
from
animal
yet
he
urged
it
is
like
it
in
the
one
essential
fact
that
though
it
has
evidently
busied
itself
about
matters
that
are
vital
to
the
of
the
organism
that
possesses
it
it
has
never
shown
the
slightest
tendency
to
occupy
itself
with
anything
else
this
he
insisted
is
as
great
a
proof
of
intelligence
as
any
living
being
can
give
plants
said
he
show
no
sign
of
interesting
themselves
in
human
affairs
we
shall
never
get
a
rose
to
understand
that
five
times
seven
are
and
there
is
no
use
in
talking
to
an
oak
about
fluctuations
in
the
price
of
stocks
hence
we
say
that
the
oak
and
the
rose
are
unintelligent
and
on
finding
that
they
do
not
understand
our
business
conclude
that
they
do
not
understand
their
own
but
what
can
a
creature
who
talks
in
this
way
know
about
intelligence
which
shows
greater
signs
of
intelligence
he
or
the
rose
and
oak
and
when
we
call
plants
stupid
for
not
understanding
our
business
how
capable
do
we
show
ourselves
of
understanding
theirs
can
we
form
even
the
faintest
conception
of
the
way
in
which
a
seed
from
a
turns
earth
air
warmth
and
water
into
a
rose
where
does
it
get
its
colour
from
from
the
earth
air
yes
but
how
those
petals
of
such
ineffable
texture
that
hue
that
outvies
the
cheek
of
a
child
that
scent
again
look
at
earth
air
and
water
these
are
all
the
raw
material
that
the
rose
has
got
to
work
with
does
it
show
any
sign
of
want
of
intelligence
in
the
alchemy
with
which
it
turns
mud
into
what
chemist
can
do
anything
comparable
why
does
no
one
try
simply
because
every
one
knows
that
no
human
intelligence
is
equal
to
the
task
we
give
it
up
it
is
the
rose
department
let
the
rose
attend
to
it
and
be
dubbed
unintelligent
because
it
baffles
us
by
the
miracles
it
works
and
the
unconcerned
way
in
which
it
works
them
see
what
pains
again
plants
take
to
protect
themselves
against
their
enemies
they
scratch
cut
sting
make
bad
smells
secrete
the
most
dreadful
poisons
which
heaven
only
knows
how
they
contrive
to
make
cover
their
precious
seeds
with
spines
like
those
of
a
hedgehog
frighten
insects
with
delicate
nervous
systems
by
assuming
portentous
shapes
hide
themselves
grow
in
inaccessible
places
and
tell
lies
so
plausibly
as
to
deceive
even
their
subtlest
foes
they
lay
traps
smeared
with
to
catch
insects
and
persuade
them
to
drown
themselves
in
pitchers
which
they
have
made
of
their
leaves
and
fill
with
water
others
make
themselves
as
it
were
into
living
which
close
with
a
spring
on
any
insect
that
settles
upon
them
others
make
their
flowers
into
the
shape
of
a
certain
fly
that
is
a
great
pillager
of
honey
so
that
when
the
real
fly
comes
it
thinks
that
the
flowers
are
bespoke
and
goes
on
elsewhere
some
are
so
clever
as
even
to
overreach
themselves
like
the
which
gets
pulled
up
and
eaten
for
the
sake
of
that
pungency
with
which
it
protects
itself
against
underground
enemies
if
on
the
other
hand
they
think
that
any
insect
can
be
of
service
to
them
see
how
pretty
they
make
themselves
what
is
to
be
intelligent
if
to
know
how
to
do
what
one
wants
to
do
and
to
do
it
repeatedly
is
not
to
be
intelligent
some
say
that
the
seed
does
not
want
to
grow
into
a
why
then
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
reasonable
does
it
grow
likely
enough
it
is
unaware
of
the
want
that
is
spurring
it
on
to
action
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
a
human
embryo
knows
that
it
wants
to
grow
into
a
baby
or
a
baby
into
a
man
nothing
ever
shows
signs
of
knowing
what
it
is
either
wanting
or
doing
when
its
convictions
both
as
to
what
it
wants
and
how
to
get
it
have
been
settled
beyond
further
power
of
question
the
less
signs
living
creatures
give
of
knowing
what
they
do
provided
they
do
it
and
do
it
repeatedly
and
well
the
greater
proof
they
give
that
in
reality
they
know
how
to
do
it
and
have
done
it
already
on
an
infinite
number
of
past
occasions
some
one
may
say
he
continued
do
you
mean
by
talking
about
an
infinite
number
of
past
occasions
when
did
a
make
itself
into
a
on
any
past
occasion
i
answer
this
question
with
another
the
ever
form
part
of
the
identity
of
the
on
which
it
grew
who
can
say
that
it
did
not
again
i
ask
this
ever
linked
by
all
those
links
that
we
commonly
consider
as
constituting
personal
identity
with
the
seed
from
which
it
in
its
turn
grew
who
can
say
that
it
was
not
then
if
number
two
is
a
continuation
of
the
personality
of
its
parent
and
if
that
is
a
continuation
of
the
personality
of
the
from
which
it
sprang
number
two
must
also
be
a
continuation
of
the
personality
of
the
earlier
and
this
must
be
a
continuation
of
the
personality
of
the
preceding
and
so
back
and
back
hence
it
is
impossible
to
deny
continued
personality
between
any
existing
and
the
earliest
seed
that
can
be
called
a
at
all
the
answer
then
to
our
objector
is
not
far
to
seek
the
did
what
it
now
does
in
the
persons
of
its
ancestors
to
whom
it
has
been
so
linked
as
to
be
able
to
remember
what
those
ancestors
did
when
they
were
placed
as
the
now
is
each
stage
of
development
brings
back
the
recollection
of
the
course
taken
in
the
preceding
stage
and
the
development
has
been
so
often
repeated
that
all
doubt
and
with
all
doubt
all
consciousness
of
action
is
suspended
but
an
objector
may
still
say
that
the
linking
between
all
successive
generations
has
been
so
close
and
unbroken
that
each
one
of
them
may
be
conceived
as
able
to
remember
what
it
did
in
the
persons
of
its
ancestors
how
do
you
show
that
it
actually
did
remember
the
answer
is
the
action
which
each
generation
takes
an
action
which
repeats
all
the
phenomena
that
we
commonly
associate
with
memory
which
is
explicable
on
the
supposition
that
it
has
been
guided
by
memory
and
which
has
neither
been
explained
nor
seems
ever
likely
to
be
explained
on
any
other
theory
than
the
supposition
that
there
is
an
abiding
memory
between
successive
generations
will
any
one
bring
an
example
of
any
living
creature
whose
action
we
can
understand
performing
an
ineffably
difficult
and
intricate
action
time
after
time
with
invariable
success
and
yet
not
knowing
how
to
do
it
and
never
having
done
it
before
show
me
the
example
and
i
will
say
no
more
but
until
it
is
shown
me
i
shall
credit
action
where
i
can
not
watch
it
with
being
controlled
by
the
same
laws
as
when
it
is
within
our
ken
it
will
become
unconscious
as
soon
as
the
skill
that
directs
it
has
become
perfected
neither
therefore
nor
embryo
should
be
expected
to
show
signs
of
knowing
that
they
know
what
they
know
if
they
showed
such
signs
the
fact
of
their
knowing
what
they
want
and
how
to
get
it
might
more
reasonably
be
doubted
some
of
the
passages
already
given
in
chapter
xxiii
were
obviously
inspired
by
the
one
just
quoted
as
i
read
it
in
a
reprint
shown
me
by
a
professor
who
had
edited
much
of
the
early
literature
on
the
subject
i
could
not
but
remember
the
one
in
which
our
lord
tells
his
disciples
to
consider
the
lilies
of
the
field
who
neither
toil
nor
spin
but
whose
raiment
surpasses
even
that
of
solomon
in
all
his
glory
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
is
that
so
toil
not
perhaps
not
now
that
the
method
of
procedure
is
so
well
known
as
to
admit
of
no
further
question
but
it
is
not
likely
that
lilies
came
to
make
themselves
so
beautifully
without
having
ever
taken
any
pains
about
the
matter
neither
do
they
spin
not
with
a
but
is
there
no
textile
fabric
in
a
leaf
what
would
the
lilies
of
the
field
say
if
they
heard
one
of
us
declaring
that
they
neither
toil
nor
spin
they
would
say
i
take
it
much
what
we
should
if
we
were
to
hear
of
their
preaching
humility
on
the
text
of
solomons
and
saying
consider
the
solomons
in
all
their
glory
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
we
should
say
that
the
lilies
were
talking
about
things
that
they
did
not
understand
and
that
though
the
solomons
do
not
toil
nor
spin
yet
there
had
been
no
lack
of
either
toiling
or
spinning
before
they
came
to
be
arrayed
so
gorgeously
let
me
now
return
to
the
professor
i
have
said
enough
to
show
the
general
drift
of
the
arguments
on
which
he
relied
in
order
to
show
that
vegetables
are
only
animals
under
another
name
but
have
not
stated
his
case
in
anything
like
the
fullness
with
which
he
laid
it
before
the
public
the
conclusion
he
drew
or
pretended
to
draw
was
that
if
it
was
sinful
to
kill
and
eat
animals
it
was
not
less
sinful
to
do
the
like
by
vegetables
or
their
seeds
none
such
he
said
should
be
eaten
save
what
had
died
a
natural
death
such
as
fruit
that
was
lying
on
the
ground
and
about
to
rot
or
that
had
turned
yellow
in
late
autumn
these
and
other
like
garbage
he
declared
to
be
the
only
food
that
might
be
eaten
with
a
clear
conscience
even
so
the
eater
must
plant
the
pips
of
any
apples
or
pears
that
he
may
have
eaten
or
any
stones
and
the
like
or
he
would
come
near
to
incurring
the
guilt
of
infanticide
the
grain
of
cereals
according
to
him
was
out
of
the
question
for
every
such
grain
had
a
living
soul
as
much
as
man
had
and
had
as
good
a
right
as
man
to
possess
that
soul
in
peace
having
thus
driven
his
fellow
countrymen
into
a
corner
at
the
point
of
a
logical
bayonet
from
which
they
felt
that
there
was
no
escape
he
proposed
that
the
question
what
was
to
be
done
should
be
referred
to
an
oracle
in
which
the
whole
country
had
the
greatest
confidence
and
to
which
recourse
was
always
had
in
times
of
special
perplexity
it
was
whispered
that
a
near
relation
of
the
philosopher
was
to
the
priestess
who
delivered
the
oracle
and
the
puritan
party
declared
that
the
strangely
unequivocal
answer
of
the
oracle
was
obtained
by
backstairs
influence
but
whether
this
was
so
or
no
the
response
as
nearly
as
i
can
translate
it
was
as
follows
he
who
sins
aught
sins
more
than
he
ought
but
he
who
sins
nought
has
much
to
be
taught
beat
or
be
beaten
eat
or
be
eaten
be
killed
or
kill
choose
which
you
will
it
was
clear
that
this
response
sanctioned
at
any
rate
the
destruction
of
vegetable
life
when
wanted
as
food
by
man
and
so
forcibly
had
the
philosopher
shown
that
what
was
sauce
for
vegetables
was
so
also
for
animals
that
though
the
puritan
party
made
a
furious
outcry
the
acts
forbidding
the
use
of
meat
were
repealed
by
a
considerable
majority
thus
after
several
hundred
years
of
wandering
in
the
wilderness
of
philosophy
the
country
reached
the
conclusions
that
common
sense
had
long
since
arrived
at
even
the
puritans
after
a
vain
attempt
to
subsist
on
a
kind
of
jam
made
of
apples
and
yellow
cabbage
leaves
succumbed
to
the
inevitable
and
resigned
themselves
to
a
diet
of
roast
beef
and
mutton
with
all
the
usual
adjuncts
of
a
modern
one
would
have
thought
that
the
dance
they
had
been
led
by
the
old
prophet
and
that
still
madder
dance
which
the
professor
of
botany
had
gravely
but
as
i
believe
insidiously
proposed
to
lead
them
would
have
made
the
erewhonians
for
a
long
time
suspicious
of
prophets
whether
they
professed
to
have
communications
with
an
unseen
power
or
no
but
so
engrained
in
the
human
heart
is
the
desire
to
believe
that
some
people
really
do
know
what
they
say
they
know
and
can
thus
save
them
from
the
trouble
of
thinking
for
themselves
that
in
a
short
time
philosophers
and
faddists
became
more
powerful
than
ever
and
gradually
led
their
countrymen
to
accept
all
those
absurd
views
of
life
some
account
of
which
i
have
given
in
my
earlier
chapters
indeed
i
can
see
no
hope
for
the
erewhonians
till
they
have
got
to
understand
that
reason
uncorrected
by
instinct
is
as
bad
as
instinct
uncorrected
by
reason
chapter
xxviii
escape
though
busily
engaged
in
translating
the
extracts
given
in
the
last
five
chapters
i
was
also
laying
matters
in
train
for
my
escape
with
arowhena
and
indeed
it
was
high
time
for
i
received
an
intimation
from
one
of
the
cashiers
of
the
musical
banks
that
i
was
to
be
prosecuted
in
a
criminal
court
ostensibly
for
measles
but
really
for
having
owned
a
watch
and
attempted
the
reintroduction
of
machinery
i
asked
why
measles
and
was
told
that
there
was
a
fear
lest
extenuating
circumstances
should
prevent
a
jury
from
convicting
me
if
i
were
indicted
for
typhus
or
but
that
a
verdict
would
probably
be
obtained
for
measles
a
disease
which
could
be
sufficiently
punished
in
a
person
of
my
age
i
was
given
to
understand
that
unless
some
unexpected
change
should
come
over
the
mind
of
his
majesty
i
might
expect
the
blow
to
be
struck
within
a
very
few
days
my
plan
was
this
that
arowhena
and
i
should
escape
in
a
balloon
together
i
fear
that
the
reader
will
disbelieve
this
part
of
my
story
yet
in
no
other
have
i
endeavoured
to
adhere
more
conscientiously
to
facts
and
can
only
throw
myself
upon
his
charity
i
had
already
gained
the
ear
of
the
queen
and
had
so
worked
upon
her
curiosity
that
she
promised
to
get
leave
for
me
to
have
a
balloon
made
and
inflated
i
pointed
out
to
her
that
no
complicated
machinery
would
be
wanted
nothing
in
fact
but
a
large
quantity
of
oiled
silk
a
car
a
few
ropes
and
some
light
kind
of
gas
such
as
the
antiquarians
who
were
acquainted
with
the
means
employed
by
the
ancients
for
the
production
of
the
lighter
gases
could
easily
instruct
her
workmen
how
to
provide
her
eagerness
to
see
so
strange
a
sight
as
the
ascent
of
a
human
being
into
the
sky
overcame
any
scruples
of
conscience
that
she
might
have
otherwise
felt
and
she
set
the
antiquarians
about
showing
her
workmen
how
to
make
the
gas
and
sent
her
maids
to
buy
and
oil
a
very
large
quantity
of
silk
for
i
was
determined
that
the
balloon
should
be
a
big
one
even
before
she
began
to
try
and
gain
the
king
permission
this
however
she
now
set
herself
to
do
for
i
had
sent
her
word
that
my
prosecution
was
imminent
as
for
myself
i
need
hardly
say
that
i
knew
nothing
about
balloons
nor
did
i
see
my
way
to
smuggling
arowhena
into
the
car
nevertheless
knowing
that
we
had
no
other
chance
of
getting
away
from
erewhon
i
drew
inspiration
from
the
extremity
in
which
we
were
placed
and
made
a
pattern
from
which
the
queen
workmen
were
able
to
work
successfully
meanwhile
the
queen
set
about
making
the
car
and
it
was
with
the
attachments
of
this
to
the
balloon
that
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
i
doubt
indeed
whether
i
should
have
succeeded
here
but
for
the
great
intelligence
of
a
foreman
who
threw
himself
heart
and
soul
into
the
matter
and
often
both
foresaw
requirements
the
necessity
for
which
had
escaped
me
and
suggested
the
means
of
providing
for
them
it
happened
that
there
had
been
a
long
drought
during
the
latter
part
of
which
prayers
had
been
vainly
offered
up
in
all
the
temples
of
the
air
god
when
i
first
told
her
majesty
that
i
wanted
a
balloon
i
said
my
intention
was
to
go
up
into
the
sky
and
prevail
upon
the
air
god
by
means
of
a
personal
interview
i
own
that
this
proposition
bordered
on
the
idolatrous
but
i
have
long
since
repented
of
it
and
am
little
likely
ever
to
repeat
the
offence
moreover
the
deceit
serious
though
it
was
will
probably
lead
to
the
conversion
of
the
whole
country
when
the
queen
told
his
majesty
of
my
proposal
he
at
first
not
only
ridiculed
it
but
was
inclined
to
veto
it
being
however
a
very
uxorious
husband
he
at
length
consented
as
he
eventually
always
did
to
everything
on
which
the
queen
had
set
her
heart
he
yielded
all
the
more
readily
now
because
he
did
not
believe
in
the
possibility
of
my
ascent
he
was
convinced
that
even
though
the
balloon
should
mount
a
few
feet
into
the
air
it
would
collapse
immediately
whereon
i
should
fall
and
break
my
neck
and
he
should
be
rid
of
me
he
demonstrated
this
to
her
so
convincingly
that
she
was
alarmed
and
tried
to
talk
me
into
giving
up
the
idea
but
on
finding
that
i
persisted
in
my
wish
to
have
the
balloon
made
she
produced
an
order
from
the
king
to
the
effect
that
all
facilities
i
might
require
should
be
afforded
me
at
the
same
time
her
majesty
told
me
that
my
attempted
ascent
would
be
made
an
article
of
impeachment
against
me
in
case
i
did
not
succeed
in
prevailing
on
the
air
god
to
stop
the
drought
neither
king
nor
queen
had
any
idea
that
i
meant
going
right
away
if
i
could
get
the
wind
to
take
me
nor
had
he
any
conception
of
the
existence
of
a
certain
steady
upper
current
of
air
which
was
always
setting
in
one
direction
as
could
be
seen
by
the
shape
of
the
higher
clouds
which
pointed
invariably
from
to
i
had
myself
long
noticed
this
peculiarity
in
the
climate
and
attributed
it
i
believe
justly
to
a
which
was
constant
at
a
few
thousand
feet
above
the
earth
but
was
disturbed
by
local
influences
at
lower
elevations
my
next
business
was
to
break
the
plan
to
arowhena
and
to
devise
the
means
for
getting
her
into
the
car
i
felt
sure
that
she
would
come
with
me
but
had
made
up
my
mind
that
if
her
courage
failed
her
the
whole
thing
should
come
to
nothing
arowhena
and
i
had
been
in
constant
communication
through
her
maid
but
i
had
thought
it
best
not
to
tell
her
the
details
of
my
scheme
till
everything
was
settled
the
time
had
now
arrived
and
i
arranged
with
the
maid
that
i
should
be
admitted
by
a
private
door
into
nosnibor
garden
at
about
dusk
on
the
following
evening
i
came
at
the
appointed
time
the
girl
let
me
into
the
garden
and
bade
me
wait
in
a
secluded
alley
until
arowhena
should
come
it
was
now
early
summer
and
the
leaves
were
so
thick
upon
the
trees
that
even
though
some
one
else
had
entered
the
garden
i
could
have
easily
hidden
myself
the
night
was
one
of
extreme
beauty
the
sun
had
long
set
but
there
was
still
a
rosy
gleam
in
the
sky
over
the
ruins
of
the
railway
station
below
me
was
the
city
already
twinkling
with
lights
while
beyond
it
stretched
the
plains
for
many
a
league
until
they
blended
with
the
sky
i
just
noted
these
things
but
i
could
not
heed
them
i
could
heed
nothing
till
as
i
peered
into
the
darkness
of
the
alley
i
perceived
a
white
figure
gliding
swiftly
towards
me
i
bounded
towards
it
and
ere
thought
could
either
prompt
or
check
i
had
caught
arowhena
to
my
heart
and
covered
her
unresisting
cheek
with
kisses
so
overjoyed
were
we
that
we
knew
not
how
to
speak
indeed
i
do
not
know
when
we
should
have
found
words
and
come
to
our
senses
if
the
maid
had
not
gone
off
into
a
fit
of
hysterics
and
awakened
us
to
the
necessity
of
then
briefly
and
plainly
i
unfolded
what
i
proposed
i
showed
her
the
darkest
side
for
i
felt
sure
that
the
darker
the
prospect
the
more
likely
she
was
to
come
i
told
her
that
my
plan
would
probably
end
in
death
for
both
of
us
and
that
i
dared
not
press
it
that
at
a
word
from
her
it
should
be
abandoned
still
that
there
was
just
a
possibility
of
our
escaping
together
to
some
part
of
the
world
where
there
would
be
no
bar
to
our
getting
married
and
that
i
could
see
no
other
hope
she
made
no
resistance
not
a
sign
or
hint
of
doubt
or
hesitation
she
would
do
all
i
told
her
and
come
whenever
i
was
ready
so
i
bade
her
send
her
maid
to
meet
me
nightly
told
her
that
she
must
put
a
good
face
on
look
as
bright
and
happy
as
she
could
so
as
to
make
her
father
and
mother
and
zulora
think
that
she
was
forgetting
me
and
be
ready
at
a
moment
notice
to
come
to
the
queen
workshops
and
be
concealed
among
the
ballast
and
under
rugs
in
the
car
of
the
balloon
and
so
we
parted
i
hurried
my
preparations
forward
for
i
feared
rain
and
also
that
the
king
might
change
his
mind
but
the
weather
continued
dry
and
in
another
week
the
queen
workmen
had
finished
the
balloon
and
car
while
the
gas
was
ready
to
be
turned
on
into
the
balloon
at
any
moment
all
being
now
prepared
i
was
to
ascend
on
the
following
morning
i
had
stipulated
for
being
allowed
to
take
abundance
of
rugs
and
wrappings
as
protection
from
the
cold
of
the
upper
atmosphere
and
also
ten
or
a
dozen
bags
of
ballast
i
had
nearly
a
quarter
pension
in
hand
and
with
this
i
arowhena
maid
and
bribed
the
queen
foreman
who
would
i
believe
have
given
me
assistance
even
without
a
bribe
he
helped
me
to
secrete
food
and
wine
in
the
bags
of
ballast
and
on
the
morning
of
my
ascent
he
kept
the
other
workmen
out
of
the
way
while
i
got
arowhena
into
the
car
she
came
with
early
dawn
muffled
up
and
in
her
maid
dress
she
was
supposed
to
be
gone
to
an
early
performance
at
one
of
the
musical
banks
and
told
me
that
she
should
not
be
missed
till
breakfast
but
that
her
absence
must
then
be
discovered
i
arranged
the
ballast
about
her
so
that
it
should
conceal
her
as
she
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
car
and
covered
her
with
wrappings
although
it
still
wanted
some
hours
of
the
time
fixed
for
my
ascent
i
could
not
trust
myself
one
moment
from
the
car
so
i
got
into
it
at
once
and
watched
the
gradual
inflation
of
the
balloon
luggage
i
had
none
save
the
provisions
hidden
in
the
ballast
bags
the
books
of
mythology
and
the
treatises
on
the
machines
with
my
own
manuscript
diaries
and
translations
i
sat
quietly
and
awaited
the
hour
fixed
for
my
departure
quiet
outwardly
but
inwardly
i
was
in
an
agony
of
suspense
lest
absence
should
be
discovered
before
the
arrival
of
the
king
and
queen
who
were
to
witness
my
ascent
they
were
not
due
yet
for
another
two
hours
and
during
this
time
a
hundred
things
might
happen
any
one
of
which
would
undo
me
at
last
the
balloon
was
full
the
pipe
which
had
filled
it
was
removed
the
escape
of
the
gas
having
been
first
carefully
precluded
nothing
remained
to
hinder
the
balloon
from
ascending
but
the
hands
and
weight
of
those
who
were
holding
on
to
it
with
ropes
i
strained
my
eyes
for
the
coming
of
the
king
and
queen
but
could
see
no
sign
of
their
approach
i
looked
in
the
direction
of
nosnibor
house
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
disturbance
but
it
was
not
yet
breakfast
time
the
crowd
began
to
gather
they
were
aware
that
i
was
under
the
displeasure
of
the
court
but
i
could
detect
no
signs
of
my
being
unpopular
on
the
contrary
i
received
many
kindly
expressions
of
regard
and
encouragement
with
good
wishes
as
to
the
result
of
my
journey
i
was
speaking
to
one
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
and
telling
him
the
substance
of
what
i
intended
to
do
when
i
had
got
into
the
presence
of
the
air
god
what
he
thought
of
me
i
can
not
guess
for
i
am
sure
that
he
did
not
believe
in
the
objective
existence
of
the
air
god
nor
that
i
myself
believed
in
it
when
i
became
aware
of
a
small
crowd
of
people
running
as
fast
as
they
could
from
nosnibor
house
towards
the
queen
workshops
for
the
moment
my
pulse
ceased
beating
and
then
knowing
that
the
time
had
come
when
i
must
either
do
or
die
i
called
vehemently
to
those
who
were
holding
the
ropes
some
thirty
men
to
let
go
at
once
and
made
gestures
signifying
danger
and
that
there
would
be
mischief
if
they
held
on
longer
many
obeyed
the
rest
were
too
weak
to
hold
on
to
the
ropes
and
were
forced
to
let
them
go
on
this
the
balloon
bounded
suddenly
upwards
but
my
own
feeling
was
that
the
earth
had
dropped
off
from
me
and
was
sinking
fast
into
the
open
space
beneath
this
happened
at
the
very
moment
that
the
attention
of
the
crowd
was
divided
the
one
half
paying
heed
to
the
eager
gestures
of
those
coming
from
nosnibor
house
and
the
other
to
the
exclamations
from
myself
a
minute
more
and
arowhena
would
doubtless
have
been
discovered
but
before
that
minute
was
over
i
was
at
such
a
height
above
the
city
that
nothing
could
harm
me
and
every
second
both
the
town
and
the
crowd
became
smaller
and
more
confused
in
an
incredibly
short
time
i
could
see
little
but
a
vast
wall
of
blue
plains
rising
up
against
me
towards
whichever
side
i
looked
at
first
the
balloon
mounted
vertically
upwards
but
after
about
five
minutes
when
we
had
already
attained
a
very
great
elevation
i
fancied
that
the
objects
on
the
plain
beneath
began
to
move
from
under
me
i
did
not
feel
so
much
as
a
breath
of
wind
and
could
not
suppose
that
the
balloon
itself
was
travelling
i
was
therefore
wondering
what
this
strange
movement
of
fixed
objects
could
mean
when
it
struck
me
that
people
in
a
balloon
do
not
feel
the
wind
inasmuch
as
they
travel
with
it
and
offer
it
no
resistance
then
i
was
happy
in
thinking
that
i
must
now
have
reached
the
invariable
trade
wind
of
the
upper
air
and
that
i
should
be
very
possibly
wafted
for
hundreds
or
even
thousands
of
miles
far
from
erewhon
and
the
erewhonians
already
i
had
removed
the
wrappings
and
freed
arowhena
but
i
soon
covered
her
up
with
them
again
for
it
was
already
very
cold
and
she
was
half
stupefied
with
the
strangeness
of
her
position
and
now
began
a
time
and
delirious
of
which
i
do
not
suppose
that
i
shall
ever
recover
a
distinct
recollection
some
things
i
can
recall
as
that
we
were
ere
long
enveloped
in
vapour
which
froze
upon
my
moustache
and
whiskers
then
comes
a
memory
of
sitting
for
hours
and
hours
in
a
thick
fog
hearing
no
sound
but
my
own
breathing
and
arowhena
for
we
hardly
spoke
and
seeing
no
sight
but
the
car
beneath
us
and
beside
us
and
the
dark
balloon
above
perhaps
the
most
painful
feeling
when
the
earth
was
hidden
was
that
the
balloon
was
motionless
though
our
only
hope
lay
in
our
going
forward
with
an
extreme
of
speed
from
time
to
time
through
a
rift
in
the
clouds
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
earth
and
was
thankful
to
perceive
that
we
must
be
flying
forward
faster
than
in
an
express
train
but
no
sooner
was
the
rift
closed
than
the
old
conviction
of
our
being
stationary
returned
in
full
force
and
was
not
to
be
reasoned
with
there
was
another
feeling
also
which
was
nearly
as
bad
for
as
a
child
that
fears
it
has
gone
blind
in
a
long
tunnel
if
there
is
no
light
so
ere
the
earth
had
been
many
minutes
hidden
i
became
half
frightened
lest
we
might
not
have
broken
away
from
it
clean
and
for
ever
now
and
again
i
ate
and
gave
food
to
arowhena
but
by
as
regards
time
then
came
darkness
a
dreadful
dreary
time
without
even
the
moon
to
cheer
us
with
dawn
the
scene
was
changed
the
clouds
were
gone
and
morning
stars
were
shining
the
rising
of
the
splendid
sun
remains
still
impressed
upon
me
as
the
most
glorious
that
i
have
ever
seen
beneath
us
there
was
an
embossed
chain
of
mountains
with
snow
fresh
fallen
upon
them
but
we
were
far
above
them
we
both
of
us
felt
our
breathing
seriously
affected
but
i
would
not
allow
the
balloon
to
descend
a
single
inch
not
knowing
for
how
long
we
might
not
need
all
the
buoyancy
which
we
could
command
indeed
i
was
thankful
to
find
that
after
nearly
hours
we
were
still
at
so
great
a
height
above
the
earth
in
a
couple
of
hours
we
had
passed
the
ranges
which
must
have
been
some
hundred
and
fifty
miles
across
and
again
i
saw
a
tract
of
level
plain
extending
far
away
to
the
horizon
i
knew
not
where
we
were
and
dared
not
descend
lest
i
should
waste
the
power
of
the
balloon
but
i
was
half
hopeful
that
we
might
be
above
the
country
from
which
i
had
originally
started
i
looked
anxiously
for
any
sign
by
which
i
could
recognise
it
but
could
see
nothing
and
feared
that
we
might
be
above
some
distant
part
of
erewhon
or
a
country
inhabited
by
savages
while
i
was
still
in
doubt
the
balloon
was
again
wrapped
in
clouds
and
we
were
left
to
blank
space
and
to
conjectures
the
weary
time
dragged
on
how
i
longed
for
my
unhappy
watch
i
felt
as
though
not
even
time
was
moving
so
dumb
and
were
our
surroundings
sometimes
i
would
feel
my
pulse
and
count
its
beats
for
together
anything
to
mark
the
time
to
prove
that
it
was
there
and
to
assure
myself
that
we
were
within
the
blessed
range
of
its
influence
and
not
gone
adrift
into
the
timelessness
of
eternity
i
had
been
doing
this
for
the
twentieth
or
thirtieth
time
and
had
fallen
into
a
light
sleep
i
dreamed
wildly
of
a
journey
in
an
express
train
and
of
arriving
at
a
railway
station
where
the
air
was
full
of
the
sound
of
locomotive
engines
blowing
off
steam
with
a
horrible
and
tremendous
hissing
i
woke
frightened
and
uneasy
but
the
hissing
and
crashing
noises
pursued
me
now
that
i
was
awake
and
forced
me
to
own
that
they
were
real
what
they
were
i
knew
not
but
they
grew
gradually
fainter
and
fainter
and
after
a
time
were
lost
in
a
few
hours
the
clouds
broke
and
i
saw
beneath
me
that
which
made
the
chilled
blood
run
colder
in
my
veins
i
saw
the
sea
and
nothing
but
the
sea
in
the
main
black
but
flecked
with
white
heads
of
angry
waves
arowhena
was
sleeping
quietly
at
the
bottom
of
the
car
and
as
i
looked
at
her
sweet
and
saintly
beauty
i
groaned
and
cursed
myself
for
the
misery
into
which
i
had
brought
her
but
there
was
nothing
for
it
now
i
sat
and
waited
for
the
worst
and
presently
i
saw
signs
as
though
that
worst
were
soon
to
be
at
hand
for
the
balloon
had
begun
to
sink
on
first
seeing
the
sea
i
had
been
impressed
with
the
idea
that
we
must
have
been
falling
but
now
there
could
be
no
mistake
we
were
sinking
and
that
fast
i
threw
out
a
bag
of
ballast
and
for
a
time
we
rose
again
but
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
the
sinking
recommenced
and
i
threw
out
another
bag
then
the
battle
commenced
in
earnest
it
lasted
all
that
afternoon
and
through
the
night
until
the
following
evening
i
had
seen
never
a
sail
nor
a
sign
of
a
sail
though
i
had
half
blinded
myself
with
straining
my
eyes
incessantly
in
every
direction
we
had
parted
with
everything
but
the
clothes
which
we
had
upon
our
backs
food
and
water
were
gone
all
thrown
out
to
the
wheeling
albatrosses
in
order
to
save
us
a
few
hours
or
even
minutes
from
the
sea
i
did
not
throw
away
the
books
till
we
were
within
a
few
feet
of
the
water
and
clung
to
my
manuscripts
to
the
very
last
hope
there
seemed
none
whatever
yet
strangely
enough
we
were
neither
of
us
utterly
hopeless
and
even
when
the
evil
that
we
dreaded
was
upon
us
and
that
which
we
greatly
feared
had
come
we
sat
in
the
car
of
the
balloon
with
the
waters
up
to
our
middle
and
still
smiled
with
a
ghastly
hopefulness
to
one
another
he
who
has
crossed
the
gothard
will
remember
that
below
andermatt
there
is
one
of
those
alpine
gorges
which
reach
the
very
utmost
limits
of
the
sublime
and
terrible
the
feelings
of
the
traveller
have
become
more
and
more
highly
wrought
at
every
step
until
at
last
the
naked
and
overhanging
precipices
seem
to
close
above
his
head
as
he
crosses
a
bridge
hung
in
over
a
roaring
waterfall
and
enters
on
the
darkness
of
a
tunnel
hewn
out
of
the
rock
what
can
be
in
store
for
him
on
emerging
surely
something
even
wilder
and
more
desolate
than
that
which
he
has
seen
already
yet
his
imagination
is
paralysed
and
can
suggest
no
fancy
or
vision
of
anything
to
surpass
the
reality
which
he
had
just
witnessed
awed
and
breathless
he
advances
when
lo
the
light
of
the
afternoon
sun
welcomes
him
as
he
leaves
the
tunnel
and
behold
a
smiling
valley
a
babbling
brook
a
village
with
tall
belfries
and
meadows
of
brilliant
green
these
are
the
things
which
greet
him
and
he
smiles
to
himself
as
the
terror
passes
away
and
in
another
moment
is
forgotten
so
fared
it
now
with
ourselves
we
had
been
in
the
water
some
two
or
three
hours
and
the
night
had
come
upon
us
we
had
said
farewell
for
the
hundredth
time
and
had
resigned
ourselves
to
meet
the
end
indeed
i
was
myself
battling
with
a
drowsiness
from
which
it
was
only
too
probable
that
i
should
never
wake
when
suddenly
arowhena
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
and
pointed
to
a
light
and
to
a
dark
mass
which
was
bearing
right
upon
us
a
cry
for
help
loud
and
clear
and
shrill
broke
forth
from
both
of
us
at
once
and
in
another
five
minutes
we
were
carried
by
kind
and
tender
hands
on
to
the
deck
of
an
italian
vessel
chapter
xxix
conclusion
the
ship
was
the
bound
from
callao
to
genoa
she
had
carried
a
number
of
emigrants
to
rio
had
gone
thence
to
callao
where
she
had
taken
in
a
cargo
of
guano
and
was
now
on
her
way
home
the
captain
was
a
certain
giovanni
gianni
a
native
of
sestri
he
has
kindly
allowed
me
to
refer
to
him
in
case
the
truth
of
my
story
should
be
disputed
but
i
grieve
to
say
that
i
suffered
him
to
mislead
himself
in
some
important
particulars
i
should
add
that
when
we
were
picked
up
we
were
a
thousand
miles
from
land
as
soon
as
we
were
on
board
the
captain
began
questioning
us
about
the
siege
of
paris
from
which
city
he
had
assumed
that
we
must
have
come
notwithstanding
our
immense
distance
from
europe
as
may
be
supposed
i
had
not
heard
a
syllable
about
the
war
between
france
and
germany
and
was
too
ill
to
do
more
than
assent
to
all
that
he
chose
to
put
into
my
mouth
my
knowledge
of
italian
is
very
imperfect
and
i
gathered
little
from
anything
that
he
said
but
i
was
glad
to
conceal
the
true
point
of
our
departure
and
resolved
to
take
any
cue
that
he
chose
to
give
me
the
line
that
thus
suggested
itself
was
that
there
had
been
ten
or
twelve
others
in
the
balloon
that
i
was
an
english
milord
and
arowhena
a
russian
countess
that
all
the
others
had
been
drowned
and
that
the
despatches
which
we
had
carried
were
lost
i
came
afterwards
to
learn
that
this
story
would
not
have
been
credible
had
not
the
captain
been
for
some
weeks
at
sea
for
i
found
that
when
we
were
picked
up
the
germans
had
already
long
been
masters
of
paris
as
it
was
the
captain
settled
the
whole
story
for
me
and
i
was
well
content
in
a
few
days
we
sighted
an
english
vessel
bound
from
melbourne
to
london
with
wool
at
my
earnest
request
in
spite
of
stormy
weather
which
rendered
it
dangerous
for
a
boat
to
take
us
from
one
ship
to
the
other
the
captain
consented
to
signal
the
english
vessel
and
we
were
received
on
board
but
we
were
transferred
with
such
difficulty
that
no
communication
took
place
as
to
the
manner
of
our
being
found
i
did
indeed
hear
the
italian
mate
who
was
in
charge
of
the
boat
shout
out
something
in
french
to
the
effect
that
we
had
been
picked
up
from
a
balloon
but
the
noise
of
the
wind
was
so
great
and
the
captain
understood
so
little
french
that
he
caught
nothing
of
the
truth
and
it
was
assumed
that
we
were
two
persons
who
had
been
saved
from
shipwreck
when
the
captain
asked
me
in
what
ship
i
had
been
wrecked
i
said
that
a
party
of
us
had
been
carried
out
to
sea
in
a
by
a
strong
current
and
that
arowhena
whom
i
described
as
a
peruvian
lady
and
i
were
alone
saved
there
were
several
passengers
whose
goodness
towards
us
we
can
never
repay
i
grieve
to
think
that
they
can
not
fail
to
discover
that
we
did
not
take
them
fully
into
our
confidence
but
had
we
told
them
all
they
would
not
have
believed
us
and
i
was
determined
that
no
one
should
hear
of
erewhon
or
have
the
chance
of
getting
there
before
me
as
long
as
i
could
prevent
it
indeed
the
recollection
of
the
many
falsehoods
which
i
was
then
obliged
to
tell
would
render
my
life
miserable
were
i
not
sustained
by
the
consolations
of
my
religion
among
the
passengers
there
was
a
most
estimable
clergyman
by
whom
arowhena
and
i
were
married
within
a
very
few
days
of
our
coming
on
board
after
a
prosperous
voyage
of
about
two
months
we
sighted
the
land
end
and
in
another
week
we
were
landed
at
london
a
liberal
subscription
was
made
for
us
on
board
the
ship
so
that
we
found
ourselves
in
no
immediate
difficulty
about
money
i
accordingly
took
arowhena
down
into
somersetshire
where
my
mother
and
sisters
had
resided
when
i
last
heard
of
them
to
my
great
sorrow
i
found
that
my
mother
was
dead
and
that
her
death
had
been
accelerated
by
the
report
of
my
having
been
killed
which
had
been
brought
to
my
employer
station
by
chowbok
it
appeared
that
he
must
have
waited
for
a
few
days
to
see
whether
i
returned
that
he
then
considered
it
safe
to
assume
that
i
should
never
do
so
and
had
accordingly
made
up
a
story
about
my
having
fallen
into
a
whirlpool
of
seething
waters
while
coming
down
the
gorge
homeward
search
was
made
for
my
body
but
the
rascal
had
chosen
to
drown
me
in
a
place
where
there
would
be
no
chance
of
its
ever
being
recovered
my
sisters
were
both
married
but
neither
of
their
husbands
was
rich
no
one
seemed
overjoyed
on
my
return
and
i
soon
discovered
that
when
a
man
relations
have
once
mourned
for
him
as
dead
they
seldom
like
the
prospect
of
having
to
mourn
for
him
a
second
time
accordingly
i
returned
to
london
with
my
wife
and
through
the
assistance
of
an
old
friend
supported
myself
by
writing
good
little
stories
for
the
magazines
and
for
a
tract
society
i
was
well
paid
and
i
trust
that
i
may
not
be
considered
presumptuous
in
saying
that
some
of
the
most
popular
of
the
which
are
distributed
in
the
streets
and
which
are
to
be
found
in
the
of
the
railway
stations
have
proceeded
from
my
pen
during
the
time
that
i
could
spare
i
arranged
my
notes
and
diary
till
they
assumed
their
present
shape
there
remains
nothing
for
me
to
add
save
to
unfold
the
scheme
which
i
propose
for
the
conversion
of
erewhon
that
scheme
has
only
been
quite
recently
decided
upon
as
the
one
which
seems
most
likely
to
be
successful
it
will
be
seen
at
once
that
it
would
be
madness
for
me
to
go
with
ten
or
a
dozen
subordinate
missionaries
by
the
same
way
as
that
which
led
me
to
discover
erewhon
i
should
be
imprisoned
for
typhus
besides
being
handed
over
to
the
straighteners
for
having
run
away
with
arowhena
an
even
darker
fate
to
which
i
dare
hardly
again
allude
would
be
reserved
for
my
devoted
it
is
plain
therefore
that
some
other
way
must
be
found
for
getting
at
the
erewhonians
and
i
am
thankful
to
say
that
such
another
way
is
not
wanting
one
of
the
rivers
which
descends
from
the
snowy
mountains
and
passes
through
erewhon
is
known
to
be
navigable
for
several
hundred
miles
from
its
mouth
its
upper
waters
have
never
yet
been
explored
but
i
feel
little
doubt
that
it
will
be
found
possible
to
take
a
light
gunboat
for
we
must
protect
ourselves
to
the
outskirts
of
the
erewhonian
country
i
propose
therefore
that
one
of
those
associations
should
be
formed
in
which
the
risk
of
each
of
the
members
is
confined
to
the
amount
of
his
stake
in
the
concern
the
first
step
would
be
to
draw
up
a
prospectus
in
this
i
would
advise
that
no
mention
should
be
made
of
the
fact
that
the
erewhonians
are
the
lost
tribes
the
discovery
is
one
of
absorbing
interest
to
myself
but
it
is
of
a
sentimental
rather
than
commercial
value
and
business
is
business
the
capital
to
be
raised
should
not
be
less
than
fifty
thousand
pounds
and
might
be
either
in
five
or
ten
pound
shares
as
hereafter
determined
this
should
be
amply
sufficient
for
the
expenses
of
an
experimental
voyage
when
the
money
had
been
subscribed
it
would
be
our
duty
to
charter
a
steamer
of
some
twelve
or
fourteen
hundred
tons
burden
and
with
accommodation
for
a
cargo
of
steerage
passengers
she
should
carry
two
or
three
guns
in
case
of
her
being
attacked
by
savages
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
boats
of
considerable
size
should
be
also
provided
and
i
think
it
would
be
desirable
that
these
also
should
carry
two
or
three
pounders
the
ship
should
be
taken
up
the
river
as
far
as
was
considered
safe
and
a
picked
party
should
then
ascend
in
the
boats
the
presence
both
of
arowhena
and
myself
would
be
necessary
at
this
stage
inasmuch
as
our
knowledge
of
the
language
would
disarm
suspicion
and
facilitate
negotiations
we
should
begin
by
representing
the
advantages
afforded
to
labour
in
the
colony
of
queensland
and
point
out
to
the
erewhonians
that
by
emigrating
thither
they
would
be
able
to
amass
each
and
all
of
them
enormous
fortunes
a
fact
which
would
be
easily
provable
by
a
reference
to
statistics
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
very
great
number
might
be
thus
induced
to
come
back
with
us
in
the
larger
boats
and
that
we
could
fill
our
vessel
with
emigrants
in
three
or
four
journeys
should
we
be
attacked
our
course
would
be
even
simpler
for
the
erewhonians
have
no
gunpowder
and
would
be
so
surprised
with
its
effects
that
we
should
be
able
to
capture
as
many
as
we
chose
in
this
case
we
should
feel
able
to
engage
them
on
more
advantageous
terms
for
they
would
be
prisoners
of
war
but
even
though
we
were
to
meet
with
no
violence
i
doubt
not
that
a
cargo
of
seven
or
eight
hundred
erewhonians
could
be
induced
when
they
were
once
on
board
the
vessel
to
sign
an
agreement
which
should
be
mutually
advantageous
both
to
us
and
them
we
should
then
proceed
to
queensland
and
dispose
of
our
engagement
with
the
erewhonians
to
the
of
that
settlement
who
are
in
great
want
of
labour
it
is
believed
that
the
money
thus
realised
would
enable
us
to
declare
a
handsome
dividend
and
leave
a
considerable
balance
which
might
be
spent
in
repeating
our
operations
and
bringing
over
other
cargoes
of
erewhonians
with
fresh
consequent
profits
in
fact
we
could
go
backwards
and
forwards
as
long
as
there
was
a
demand
for
labour
in
queensland
or
indeed
in
any
other
christian
colony
for
the
supply
of
erewhonians
would
be
unlimited
and
they
could
be
packed
closely
and
fed
at
a
very
reasonable
cost
it
would
be
my
duty
and
arowhena
to
see
that
our
emigrants
should
be
boarded
and
lodged
in
the
households
of
religious
these
persons
would
give
them
the
benefit
of
that
instruction
whereof
they
stand
so
greatly
in
need
each
day
as
soon
as
they
could
be
spared
from
their
work
in
the
plantations
they
would
be
assembled
for
praise
and
be
thoroughly
grounded
in
the
church
catechism
while
the
whole
of
every
sabbath
should
be
devoted
to
singing
psalms
and
this
must
be
insisted
upon
both
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
any
uneasy
feeling
which
might
show
itself
either
in
queensland
or
in
the
mother
country
as
to
the
means
whereby
the
erewhonians
had
been
obtained
and
also
because
it
would
give
our
own
shareholders
the
comfort
of
reflecting
that
they
were
saving
souls
and
filling
their
own
pockets
at
one
and
the
same
moment
by
the
time
the
emigrants
had
got
too
old
for
work
they
would
have
become
thoroughly
instructed
in
religion
they
could
then
be
shipped
back
to
erewhon
and
carry
the
good
seed
with
them
i
can
see
no
hitch
nor
difficulty
about
the
matter
and
trust
that
this
book
will
sufficiently
advertise
the
scheme
to
insure
the
subscription
of
the
necessary
capital
as
soon
as
this
is
forthcoming
i
will
guarantee
that
i
convert
the
erewhonians
not
only
into
good
christians
but
into
a
source
of
considerable
profit
to
the
shareholders
i
should
add
that
i
can
not
claim
the
credit
for
having
originated
the
above
scheme
i
had
been
for
months
at
my
wit
end
forming
plan
after
plan
for
the
evangelisation
of
erewhon
when
by
one
of
those
special
interpositions
which
should
be
a
sufficient
answer
to
the
sceptic
and
make
even
the
most
confirmed
rationalist
irrational
my
eye
was
directed
to
the
following
paragraph
in
the
newspaper
of
one
of
the
first
days
in
january
polynesians
in
the
marquis
of
normanby
the
new
governor
of
queensland
has
completed
his
inspection
of
the
northern
districts
of
the
colony
it
is
stated
that
at
mackay
one
of
the
best
growing
districts
his
excellency
saw
a
good
deal
of
the
polynesians
in
the
course
of
a
speech
to
those
who
entertained
him
there
the
marquis
said
have
been
told
that
the
means
by
which
polynesians
were
obtained
were
not
legitimate
but
i
have
failed
to
perceive
this
in
so
far
at
least
as
queensland
is
concerned
and
if
one
can
judge
by
the
countenances
and
manners
of
the
polynesians
they
experience
no
regret
at
their
position
but
his
excellency
pointed
out
the
advantage
of
giving
them
religious
instruction
it
would
tend
to
set
at
rest
an
uneasy
feeling
which
at
present
existed
in
the
country
to
know
that
they
were
inclined
to
retain
the
polynesians
and
teach
them
religion
i
feel
that
comment
is
unnecessary
and
will
therefore
conclude
with
one
word
of
thanks
to
the
reader
who
may
have
had
the
patience
to
follow
me
through
my
adventures
without
losing
his
temper
but
with
two
for
any
who
may
write
at
once
to
the
secretary
of
the
erewhon
evangelisation
company
limited
at
the
address
which
shall
hereafter
be
advertised
and
request
to
have
his
name
put
down
as
a
shareholder
i
had
just
received
and
corrected
the
last
proof
of
the
foregoing
volume
and
was
walking
down
the
strand
from
temple
bar
to
charing
cross
when
on
passing
exeter
hall
i
saw
a
number
of
looking
people
crowding
into
the
building
with
faces
full
of
interested
and
complacent
anticipation
i
stopped
and
saw
an
announcement
that
a
missionary
meeting
was
to
be
held
forthwith
and
that
the
native
missionary
the
rev
william
habakkuk
from
the
colony
from
which
i
had
started
on
my
adventures
would
be
introduced
and
make
a
short
address
after
some
little
difficulty
i
obtained
admission
and
heard
two
or
three
speeches
which
were
prefatory
to
the
introduction
of
habakkuk
one
of
these
struck
me
as
perhaps
the
most
presumptuous
that
i
had
ever
heard
the
speaker
said
that
the
races
of
whom
habakkuk
was
a
specimen
were
in
all
probability
the
lost
ten
tribes
of
israel
i
dared
not
contradict
him
then
but
i
felt
angry
and
injured
at
hearing
the
speaker
jump
to
so
preposterous
a
conclusion
upon
such
insufficient
grounds
the
discovery
of
the
ten
tribes
was
mine
and
mine
only
i
was
still
in
the
very
height
of
indignation
when
there
was
a
murmur
of
expectation
in
the
hall
and
habakkuk
was
brought
forward
the
reader
may
judge
of
my
surprise
at
finding
that
he
was
none
other
than
my
old
friend
chowbok
my
jaw
dropped
and
my
eyes
almost
started
out
of
my
head
with
astonishment
the
poor
fellow
was
dreadfully
frightened
and
the
storm
of
applause
which
greeted
his
introduction
seemed
only
to
add
to
his
confusion
i
dare
not
trust
myself
to
report
his
speech
indeed
i
could
hardly
listen
to
it
for
i
was
nearly
choked
with
trying
to
suppress
my
feelings
i
am
sure
that
i
caught
the
words
adelaide
the
queen
dowager
and
i
thought
that
i
heard
mary
magdalene
shortly
afterwards
but
i
had
then
to
leave
the
hall
for
fear
of
being
turned
out
while
on
the
staircase
i
heard
another
burst
of
prolonged
and
rapturous
applause
so
i
suppose
the
audience
were
satisfied
the
feelings
that
came
uppermost
in
my
mind
were
hardly
of
a
very
solemn
character
but
i
thought
of
my
first
acquaintance
with
chowbok
of
the
scene
in
the
woodshed
of
the
innumerable
lies
he
had
told
me
of
his
repeated
attempts
upon
the
brandy
and
of
many
an
incident
which
i
have
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
dwell
upon
and
i
could
not
but
derive
some
satisfaction
from
the
hope
that
my
own
efforts
might
have
contributed
to
the
change
which
had
been
doubtless
wrought
upon
him
and
that
the
rite
which
i
had
performed
however
unprofessionally
on
that
wild
upland
had
not
been
wholly
without
effect
i
trust
that
what
i
have
written
about
him
in
the
earlier
part
of
my
book
may
not
be
libellous
and
that
it
may
do
him
no
harm
with
his
employers
he
was
then
unregenerate
i
must
certainly
find
him
out
and
have
a
talk
with
him
but
before
i
shall
have
time
to
do
so
these
pages
will
be
in
the
hands
of
the
public
at
the
last
moment
i
see
a
probability
of
a
complication
which
causes
me
much
uneasiness
please
subscribe
quickly
address
to
the
care
of
the
lord
mayor
whom
i
will
instruct
to
receive
names
and
subscriptions
for
me
until
i
can
organise
a
committee
footnotes

last
part

by
litolf
the
myth
above
alluded
to
exists
in
erewhon
with
changed
names
and
considerable
modifications
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
referring
to
the
story
as
familiar
to
ourselves
what
a
word
relation
is
how
little
it
predicates
yet
it
has

the
root
alluded
to
is
not
the
potato
of
our
own
gardens
but
a
plant
so
near
akin
to
it
that
i
have
ventured
to
translate
it
thus
apropos
of
its
intelligence
had
the
writer
known
butler
he
would
probably
have
said
he
knows
what
what
and
that
as
high
as
metaphysic
wit
can
fly
since
my
return
to
england
i
have
been
told
that
those
who
are
conversant
about
machines
use
many
terms
concerning
them
which
show
that
their
vitality
is
here
recognised
and
that
a
collection
of
expressions
in
use
among
those
who
attend
on
steam
engines
would
be
no
less
startling
than
instructive
i
am
also
informed
that
almost
all
machines
have
their
own
tricks
and
idiosyncrasies
that
they
know
their
drivers
and
keepers
and
that
they
will
play
pranks
upon
a
stranger
it
is
my
intention
on
a
future
occasion
to
bring
together
examples
both
of
the
expressions
in
common
use
among
mechanicians
and
of
any
extraordinary
exhibitions
of
mechanical
sagacity
and
eccentricity
that
i
can
meet
with
not
as
believing
in
the
erewhonian
professor
theory
but
from
the
interest
of
the
subject
