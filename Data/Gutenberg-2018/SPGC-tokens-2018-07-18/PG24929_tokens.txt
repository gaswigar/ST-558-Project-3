the
passing
of
john
millinborn
i
do
know
whether
there
a
law
that
stops
my
doing
this
jim
but
if
there
is
you
got
to
get
round
it
you
a
lawyer
and
you
know
the
game
you
my
pal
and
the
best
pal
i
had
jim
and
you
do
it
for
me
the
dying
man
looked
up
into
the
old
eyes
that
were
watching
him
with
such
compassion
and
read
their
acquiescence
no
greater
difference
could
be
imagined
than
existed
between
the
man
on
the
bed
and
the
slim
neat
figure
who
sat
by
his
side
john
millinborn
a
veritable
giant
in
frame
and
even
in
his
last
days
suggesting
the
enormous
strength
which
had
been
his
in
his
prime
had
been
an
outdoor
man
a
man
of
large
voice
and
large
capable
hands
james
kitson
had
been
a
student
from
his
youth
up
and
had
spent
his
manhood
in
musty
offices
stuffy
courts
surrounded
by
crackling
briefs
and
yet
between
these
two
men
the
millionaire
and
the
successful
solicitor
utterly
different
in
their
tastes
and
their
modes
of
life
was
a
friendship
deep
and
true
strange
that
death
should
take
the
strong
and
leave
the
weak
so
thought
james
kitson
as
he
watched
his
friend
i
do
what
can
be
done
john
you
leave
a
great
responsibility
upon
the
girl
a
million
and
a
half
of
money
the
sick
man
nodded
i
get
rid
of
a
greater
one
jim
when
my
father
died
he
left
a
hundred
thousand
between
us
my
sister
and
i
turned
my
share
into
a
million
but
that
is
by
the
way
because
she
was
a
fairly
rich
girl
and
a
wilful
girl
jim
she
broke
her
heart
because
they
knew
she
had
the
money
the
worst
men
were
attracted
to
her
and
she
chose
the
worst
of
the
worst
he
stopped
speaking
to
get
his
breath
she
married
a
plausible
villain
who
ruined
her
spent
every
sou
and
left
her
with
a
mountain
of
debt
and
a
baby
poor
grace
died
and
he
married
again
i
tried
to
get
the
baby
but
he
held
it
as
a
hostage
i
could
never
trace
the
child
after
it
was
two
years
old
it
was
only
a
month
ago
i
learnt
the
reason
the
man
was
an
international
swindler
and
was
wanted
by
the
police
he
was
arrested
in
paris
and
charged
in
his
true
name
the
name
he
had
married
in
was
false
when
he
came
out
of
prison
he
took
his
own
name
and
of
course
the
child
name
changed
too
the
lawyer
nodded
you
want
me
to
get
the
will
proved
and
begin
your
search
for
oliva
prédeaux
there
is
no
such
person
the
girl
name
you
know
and
i
have
told
you
where
she
is
living
you
find
nobody
who
knows
oliva
prédeaux
her
father
disappeared
when
she
was
six
he
probably
dead
and
her
stepmother
brought
her
up
without
knowing
her
relationship
to
me
then
she
died
and
the
girl
has
been
working
ever
since
she
was
fifteen
she
is
not
to
be
found
until
she
is
married
watch
her
jim
spend
all
the
money
you
wish
do
influence
her
unless
you
see
she
is
getting
the
wrong
kind
of
man
his
voice
which
had
grown
to
something
of
the
old
strength
suddenly
dropped
and
the
great
head
rolled
sideways
on
the
pillow
kitson
rose
and
crossed
to
the
door
it
opened
upon
a
spacious
through
the
big
open
windows
of
which
could
be
seen
the
broad
acres
of
the
sussex
weald
a
man
was
sitting
in
the
chin
in
hand
looking
across
to
the
chequered
fields
on
the
slope
of
the
downs
he
was
a
man
of
thirty
with
a
pointed
beard
and
he
rose
as
the
lawyer
stepped
quickly
into
the
room
anything
wrong
he
asked
i
think
he
has
fainted
will
you
go
to
him
doctor
the
young
man
passed
swiftly
and
noiselessly
to
the
bedside
and
made
a
brief
examination
from
a
shelf
near
the
head
of
the
bed
he
took
a
hypodermic
syringe
and
filled
it
from
a
small
bottle
baring
the
patient
side
he
slowly
injected
the
drug
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
the
unconscious
man
then
came
back
to
the
big
hall
where
james
kitson
was
waiting
well
the
doctor
shook
his
head
it
is
difficult
to
form
a
judgment
he
said
quietly
his
heart
is
all
gone
to
pieces
has
he
a
family
doctor
not
so
far
as
i
know
he
hated
doctors
and
has
never
been
ill
in
his
life
i
wonder
he
tolerated
you
van
heerden
smiled
he
could
help
himself
he
was
taken
ill
in
the
train
on
the
way
to
this
place
and
i
happened
to
be
a
he
asked
me
to
bring
him
here
and
i
have
been
here
ever
since
it
is
strange
he
added
that
so
rich
a
man
as
millinborn
had
no
servant
travelling
with
him
and
should
live
practically
alone
in
this
well
it
is
little
better
than
a
cottage
despite
his
anxiety
james
kitson
smiled
he
is
the
type
of
man
who
hates
ostentation
i
doubt
if
he
has
ever
spent
a
thousand
a
year
on
himself
all
his
life
do
you
think
it
is
wise
to
leave
him
the
doctor
spread
out
his
hands
i
can
do
nothing
he
refused
to
allow
me
to
send
for
a
specialist
and
i
think
he
was
right
nothing
can
be
done
for
him
still
he
walked
back
to
the
bedside
and
the
lawyer
came
behind
him
john
millinborn
seemed
to
be
in
an
uneasy
sleep
and
after
an
examination
by
the
doctor
the
two
men
walked
back
to
the
the
excitement
has
been
rather
much
for
him
i
suppose
he
has
been
making
his
will
yes
said
kitson
shortly
i
gathered
as
much
when
i
saw
you
bring
the
gardener
and
the
cook
in
to
witness
a
document
said
van
heerden
he
tapped
his
teeth
with
the
tip
of
his
fingers
a
nervous
trick
of
his
i
wish
i
had
some
strychnine
he
said
suddenly
i
ought
to
have
some
by
me
in
case
ca
you
send
a
servant
or
i
go
said
kitson
is
it
procurable
in
the
village
the
doctor
nodded
i
do
want
you
to
go
he
demurred
i
have
sent
the
car
to
eastbourne
to
get
a
few
things
i
can
not
buy
here
it
a
stiff
walk
to
the
village
and
yet
i
doubt
whether
the
chemist
would
supply
the
quantity
i
require
to
a
servant
even
with
my
prescription
you
see
he
smiled
i
am
a
stranger
here
i
go
with
pleasure
the
walk
will
do
me
good
said
the
lawyer
energetically
if
there
is
anything
we
can
do
to
prolong
my
poor
friend
life
the
doctor
sat
at
the
table
and
wrote
his
prescription
and
handed
it
to
the
other
with
an
apology
hill
lodge
john
millinborn
big
cottage
stood
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
and
the
way
to
the
village
was
steep
and
long
for
alfronston
lay
nearly
a
mile
away
down
the
slope
the
path
ran
through
a
plantation
of
young
ash
here
john
millinborn
had
preserved
a
few
pheasants
in
the
early
days
of
his
occupancy
of
the
lodge
on
the
hill
as
kitson
entered
one
side
of
the
plantation
he
heard
a
rustling
noise
as
though
somebody
were
moving
through
the
undergrowth
it
was
too
heavy
a
noise
for
a
bolting
rabbit
or
a
startled
bird
to
make
and
he
peered
into
the
thick
foliage
he
was
a
little
nearsighted
and
at
first
he
did
not
see
the
cause
of
the
commotion
then
i
suppose
i
trespassing
said
a
husky
voice
and
a
man
stepped
out
toward
him
the
stranger
carried
himself
with
a
certain
jauntiness
and
he
had
need
of
what
assistance
artifice
could
lend
him
for
he
was
singularly
unprepossessing
he
was
a
man
who
might
as
well
have
been
sixty
as
fifty
his
clothes
soiled
torn
and
greasy
were
of
good
cut
the
shirt
was
filthy
but
it
was
attached
to
a
frayed
collar
and
the
crumpled
cravat
was
ornamented
with
a
cameo
pin
but
it
was
the
face
which
attracted
kitson
attention
there
was
something
inherently
evil
in
that
puffed
face
in
the
dull
eyes
that
blinked
under
the
thick
black
eyebrows
the
lips
full
and
loose
parted
in
a
smile
as
the
lawyer
stepped
back
to
avoid
contact
with
the
unsavoury
visitor
i
suppose
i
trespassing
good
gad
me
trespassing
funny
very
funny
he
indulged
in
a
hoarse
wheezy
laugh
and
broke
suddenly
into
a
torrent
of
the
foulest
language
that
this
hardened
lawyer
had
ever
heard
pardon
pardon
he
said
stopping
as
suddenly
man
of
the
world
eh
you
understand
that
when
a
gentleman
has
grievances
he
fumbled
in
his
and
found
a
monocle
and
inserted
it
in
his
eye
there
was
an
obscenity
in
the
appearance
of
this
foul
wreck
of
a
man
which
made
the
lawyer
feel
physically
sick
trespassing
by
gad
he
went
back
to
his
first
conceit
and
his
voice
rasped
with
malignity
gad
if
i
had
my
way
with
people
i
slit
their
throats
i
would
sir
i
stick
pins
in
their
eyes
pins
boil
them
alive
hitherto
the
lawyer
had
not
spoken
but
now
his
repulsion
got
the
better
of
his
usually
equable
temper
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
sternly
you
on
private
property
take
your
beastliness
elsewhere
the
man
glared
at
him
and
laughed
trespassing
he
sneered
trespassing
very
good
your
servant
sir
he
swept
his
derby
hat
from
his
head
the
lawyer
saw
that
he
was
bald
and
turning
strutted
back
through
the
plantation
the
way
he
had
come
it
was
not
the
way
out
and
kitson
was
to
follow
and
see
the
man
off
the
estate
then
he
remembered
the
urgency
of
his
errand
and
continued
his
journey
to
the
village
on
his
way
back
he
looked
about
but
there
was
no
trace
of
the
unpleasant
intruder
who
was
he
he
wondered
some
broken
derelict
with
nothing
but
the
memory
of
former
vain
splendours
and
the
rags
of
old
fineries
nursing
a
dear
hatred
for
some
more
fortunate
fellow
nearly
an
hour
had
passed
before
he
again
panted
up
to
the
levelled
shelf
on
which
the
cottage
stood
the
doctor
was
sitting
at
the
window
as
kitson
passed
how
is
he
about
the
same
he
had
one
paroxysm
is
that
the
strychnine
i
tell
you
how
much
obliged
i
am
to
you
he
took
the
small
packet
and
placed
it
on
the
and
kitson
passed
into
the
house
honestly
doctor
what
do
you
think
of
his
chance
he
asked
van
heerden
shrugged
his
shoulders
honestly
i
do
not
think
he
will
recover
consciousness
heavens
the
lawyer
was
shocked
the
tragic
suddenness
of
it
all
stunned
him
he
had
thought
vaguely
that
days
even
weeks
might
pass
before
the
end
came
not
recover
consciousness
he
repeated
in
a
whisper
instinctively
he
was
drawn
to
the
room
where
his
friend
lay
and
the
doctor
followed
him
john
millinborn
lay
on
his
back
his
eyes
closed
his
face
a
ghastly
grey
his
big
hands
were
clutching
at
his
throat
his
shirt
was
torn
open
at
the
breast
the
two
windows
one
at
each
end
of
the
room
were
wide
and
a
gentle
breeze
blew
the
casement
curtains
the
lawyer
stooped
his
eyes
moist
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
burning
forehead
john
john
he
murmured
and
turned
away
blinded
with
tears
he
wiped
his
face
with
a
and
walked
to
the
window
staring
out
at
the
serene
loveliness
of
the
scene
over
the
weald
a
great
aeroplane
droned
to
the
sea
the
green
downs
were
dappled
white
with
grazing
flocks
and
beneath
the
windows
the
ordered
beds
blazed
and
flamed
with
flowers
crimson
and
gold
and
white
as
he
stood
there
the
man
he
had
met
in
the
plantation
came
to
his
mind
and
he
was
to
speak
to
the
doctor
of
the
incident
but
he
was
in
no
mood
for
the
description
and
the
speculation
which
would
follow
restlessly
he
paced
into
the
bedroom
the
sick
man
had
not
moved
and
again
the
lawyer
returned
he
thought
of
the
girl
that
girl
whose
name
and
relationship
with
john
millinborn
he
alone
knew
what
use
would
she
make
of
the
millions
which
all
unknown
to
her
she
would
soon
inherit
what
jim
jim
he
turned
swiftly
it
was
john
millinborn
voice
quick
come
the
doctor
had
leapt
into
the
room
and
made
his
way
to
the
bed
millinborn
was
sitting
up
and
as
the
lawyer
moved
swiftly
in
the
doctor
tracks
he
saw
his
wide
eyes
staring
jim
he
has
his
head
dropped
forward
on
his
breast
and
the
doctor
lowered
him
slowly
to
the
pillow
what
is
it
john
speak
to
me
old
man
i
afraid
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
said
the
doctor
as
he
drew
up
the
bedclothes
is
he
dead
whispered
the
lawyer
fearfully
no
but
he
beckoned
the
other
into
the
big
room
and
after
a
glance
at
the
motionless
figure
kitson
followed
there
something
very
strange
who
is
that
he
pointed
through
the
open
window
at
the
clumsy
figure
of
a
man
who
was
blundering
wildly
down
the
slope
which
led
to
the
plantation
kitson
recognized
the
man
immediately
it
was
the
uninvited
visitor
whom
he
had
met
in
the
plantation
but
there
was
something
in
the
haste
of
the
shabby
man
a
hint
of
terror
in
the
arms
that
made
the
lawyer
forget
his
tragic
environment
where
has
he
been
he
asked
who
is
he
the
doctor
face
was
white
and
drawn
as
though
he
too
sensed
some
horror
in
that
frantic
flight
kitson
walked
back
to
the
room
where
the
dying
man
lay
but
was
frozen
stiff
upon
the
threshold
doctor
doctor
the
doctor
followed
the
eyes
of
the
other
something
was
dripping
from
the
bed
to
the
floor
something
red
and
horrible
kitson
set
his
teeth
and
stepping
to
the
bedside
pulled
down
the
covers
he
stepped
back
with
a
cry
for
from
the
side
of
john
millinborn
protruded
the
ivory
handle
of
a
knife

occupied
one
of
the
four
shops
which
formed

floor

this

of
his
hobby
and
had
sold
the
block
to
a
syndicate
whose
management
on
more
occasions
than
one
had
been
the
subject
of
police
inquiry
they
had
then
fallen
into
the
hands
of
an
intelligent
woman
who
had
turned
out
the
undesirable
tenants
furnished
the
flats
plainly
but
comfortably
and
had
let
them
to
tenants
who
might
be
described
as
solvent
but
honest
krooman
chambers
had
gradually
rehabilitated
itself
in
the
eyes
of
the
neighbourhood
van
heerden
had
had
his
surgery
in
the
building
for
six
years
during
the
war
he
was
temporarily
under
suspicion
for
sympathies
with
the
enemy
but
no
proof
was
adduced
of
his
enmity
and
though
he
had
undoubtedly
been
born
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
border
at
cranenburg
which
is
the
prussian
frontier
station
on
the
line
his
name
was
undoubtedly
van
heerden
which
was
dutch
change
the
van
to
von
said
the
carping
critics
and
he
was
a
hun
and
undoubtedly
germany
was
full
of
von
heerens
and
von
heerdens
the
doctor
lived
down
criticism
lived
down
suspicion
and
got
together
a
remunerative
practice
he
had
the
largest
flat
in
the
building
one
room
of
which
was
fitted
up
as
a
laboratory
for
he
had
a
passion
for
research
the
mysterious
murder
of
john
millinborn
had
given
him
a
certain
advertisement
which
had
not
been
without
its
advantages
the
fact
that
he
had
been
in
attendance
on
the
millionaire
had
brought
him
a
larger
fame
his
theories
as
to
how
the
murder
had
been
committed
by
some
one
who
had
got
through
the
open
window
whilst
the
two
men
were
out
of
the
room
had
been
generally
accepted
for
the
police
had
found
footmarks
on
the
flowerbeds
over
which
the
murderer
must
have
passed
they
had
not
however
traced
the
personage
whom
kitson
had
seen
this
person
had
disappeared
as
mysteriously
as
he
had
arrived
three
months
after
the
murder
the
doctor
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
broad
which
led
to
the
flats
watching
the
stream
of
pedestrians
passing
it
was
six
in
the
evening
and
the
streets
were
alive
with
and
workers
on
their
way
home
from
business
he
smoked
a
cigarette
and
his
interest
was
perhaps
more
apparent
than
real
he
had
attended
his
last
surgery
case
and
the
door
of
the
shop
with
its
windows
had
been
locked
for
the
night
his
eyes
wandered
idly
to
the
oxford
street
end
of
the
thoroughfare
and
suddenly
he
started
a
girl
was
walking
toward
him
at
this
hour
there
was
very
little
wheeled
traffic
for
lattice
street
is
almost
a
and
she
had
taken
the
middle
of
the
road
she
was
dressed
with
that
effective
neatness
which
brings
the
wealthy
and
the
to
a
baffling
level
in
a
blue
serge
costume
of
severe
cut
a
plain
white
linen
and
a
small
hat
which
covered
but
did
not
hide
a
mass
of
hair
which
against
the
slanting
sunlight
at
her
back
lent
the
illusion
of
a
golden
nimbus
about
her
head
the
eyes
were
and
wise
with
the
wisdom
which
is
found
alike
in
those
who
have
suffered
and
those
who
have
watched
suffering
the
nose
was
straight
the
lips
scarlet
and
full
you
might
catalogue
every
feature
of
oliva
cresswell
and
yet
arrive
at
no
satisfactory
explanation
for
her
charm
not
in
the
clear
ivory
pallor
of
complexion
did
her
charm
lie
nor
in
the
trim
figure
with
its
promising
lines
nor
in
the
poise
of
head
nor
pride
of
carriage
nor
in
the
ready
laughter
that
came
to
those
quiet
eyes
in
no
one
particular
quality
of
attraction
did
she
excel
rather
was
her
charm
the
charm
of
the
perfect
agglomeration
of
all
those
characteristics
which
men
find
alluring
and
challenging
she
raised
her
hand
with
a
free
unaffected
gesture
and
greeted
the
doctor
with
a
flashing
smile
well
miss
cresswell
i
have
seen
you
for
quite
a
long
time
two
days
she
said
solemnly
but
i
suppose
doctors
who
know
all
the
secrets
of
nature
have
some
very
special
drug
to
sustain
them
in
trials
like
that
do
be
unkind
to
the
profession
he
laughed
and
do
be
sarcastic
to
one
so
young
by
the
way
i
have
never
asked
you
did
you
get
your
flat
changed
she
shook
her
head
and
frowned
miss
millit
says
she
can
not
move
me
abominable
he
said
and
was
annoyed
did
you
tell
her
about
beale
she
nodded
vigorously
i
said
to
her
says
i
she
had
a
trick
of
mimicry
and
dropped
easily
into
the
southern
english
accent
millit
are
you
aware
that
the
gentleman
who
lives
opposite
to
me
has
been
to
my
knowledge
consistently
drunk
for
two
months
ever
since
he
came
to
live
at
kroomans
he
annoy
you
says
she
people
always
annoy
me
says
i
beale
arrives
home
every
evening
in
a
condition
which
i
can
only
describe
as
deplorable
what
did
she
say
the
girl
made
a
little
grimace
and
became
serious
she
said
if
he
did
not
speak
to
me
or
interfere
with
me
or
frighten
me
it
was
none
of
my
business
or
something
to
that
effect
she
laughed
helplessly
really
the
flat
is
so
wonderful
and
so
cheap
that
one
can
not
afford
to
get
out
you
do
know
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
doctor
for
having
got
diggings
here
at
all
miss
millit
is
keen
on
single
young
ladies
she
sniffed
and
laughed
why
do
you
laugh
he
asked
i
was
thinking
how
queerly
you
and
i
met
the
circumstances
of
their
meeting
had
indeed
been
curious
she
was
employed
as
a
cashier
at
one
of
the
great
west
end
stores
he
had
made
some
sort
of
purchase
and
made
payment
in
a
note
which
had
proved
to
be
counterfeit
it
was
a
sad
moment
for
the
girl
when
the
forgery
was
discovered
for
she
had
to
make
up
the
loss
from
her
own
pocket
and
that
was
no
small
matter
then
the
miracle
had
happened
the
doctor
had
arrived
full
of
apologies
had
presented
his
card
and
explained
the
note
was
one
which
he
had
been
keeping
as
a
curiosity
it
has
been
passed
on
him
and
was
such
an
excellent
specimen
that
he
intended
having
it
framed
but
it
had
got
mixed
up
with
his
other
money
you
started
by
being
the
villain
of
the
piece
and
ended
by
being
my
good
fairy
she
said
i
should
never
have
known
there
was
a
vacancy
here
but
for
you
i
should
not
have
been
admitted
by
the
proper
miss
millit
but
for
the
terror
of
your
name
she
dropped
her
little
hand
lightly
on
his
shoulder
it
was
a
gesture
of
she
to
go
when
an
angry
exclamation
held
her
what
is
it
oh
i
see
no
she
drew
a
little
closer
to
the
doctor
side
and
watched
with
narrowing
lids
the
approaching
figure
why
does
he
do
it
oh
why
does
he
do
it
she
demanded
impatiently
how
can
a
man
be
so
weak
so
wretchedly
weak
there
nothing
justifies
that
that
was
apparently
trying
to
walk
the
opposite
kerb
as
though
it
were
a
save
for
a
certain
disorder
of
attire
a
protruding
necktie
and
a
muddy
hat
he
was
respectable
enough
he
was
young
and
under
other
conditions
passably
good
looking
but
with
his
fair
hair
streaming
over
his
forehead
and
his
hat
at
the
back
of
his
head
he
lacked
fascination
his
attempt
aided
by
a
used
as
a
to
keep
his
equilibrium
on
six
inches
of
kerbing
might
have
been
funny
to
a
less
sensitive
soul
than
oliva
he
slipped
recovered
himself
with
a
little
whoop
slipped
again
and
finally
gave
up
the
attempt
crossing
the
road
to
his
home
he
recognized
the
doctor
with
a
flourish
of
his
hat
glorious
weather
my
he
said
with
a
little
slur
in
his
voice
but
a
merry
smile
in
his
eye
simply
wonderful
weather
for
bacteria
trypanosomes
got
it
an
all
the
jolly
little
microbes
he
smiled
at
the
doctor
blandly
ignoring
the
other
significant
glance
at
the
girl
who
had
drawn
back
so
that
she
might
not
find
herself
included
in
the
conversation
i
goin
to
leave
you
doctor
he
went
on
goin
top
floor
away
from
the
evil
smells
of
science
an
fatal
lure
of
beauty
top
floor
jolly
stiff
climb
when
a
fellow
all
lit
up
like
the
hotel
doodledum
per
arduis
ad
astra
through
labour
to
the
stars
fine
motto
flying
corps
motto
my
motto
goo
night
off
came
his
hat
again
and
he
staggered
up
the
broad
stone
stairs
and
disappeared
round
a
turn
later
they
heard
his
door
slam
awful
and
yet
and
yet
echoed
the
doctor
i
thought
he
was
funny
i
nearly
laughed
but
how
terrible
he
so
young
and
he
has
had
a
decent
education
she
shook
her
head
sadly
presently
she
took
leave
of
the
doctor
and
made
her
way
upstairs
three
doors
opened
from
the
landing
numbers
and
she
glanced
a
little
apprehensively
at
no
as
she
passed
but
there
was
no
sound
or
sign
of
the
reveller
and
she
passed
into
no
and
closed
the
door
the
accommodation
consisted
of
two
rooms
a
a
a
and
a
tiny
kitchen
the
rent
was
remarkably
low
less
than
a
quarter
of
her
weekly
earnings
and
she
managed
to
live
comfortably
she
lit
the
and
put
on
the
kettle
and
began
to
lay
the
table
there
was
a
tin
of
something
in
the
diminutive
pantry
a
small
loaf
and
a
jug
of
milk
a
tomato
or
two
and
a
bottle
of
dressing
the
high
tea
to
which
she
sat
down
a
little
flushed
of
the
face
and
quite
happy
was
seasoned
with
content
she
thought
of
the
doctor
and
accounted
herself
lucky
to
have
so
good
a
friend
he
was
so
sensible
there
was
no
nonsense
about
him
he
never
tried
to
hold
her
hand
as
the
stupid
buyers
did
nor
make
clumsy
attempts
to
kiss
her
as
one
of
the
partners
had
done
the
doctor
was
different
from
them
all
she
could
not
imagine
him
sitting
by
the
side
of
a
girl
in
a
bus
pressing
her
foot
with
his
or
accosting
her
in
the
street
with
a
have
we
met
before
she
ate
her
meal
slowly
reading
the
evening
newspaper
and
dreaming
at
intervals
it
was
dusk
when
she
had
finished
and
she
switched
on
the
electric
light
there
was
a
meter
in
the
that
acted
eccentrically
sometimes
one
shilling
would
supply
light
for
a
week
at
other
times
after
two
days
the
lights
would
flicker
spasmodically
and
expire
she
remembered
that
it
was
a
perilous
long
time
since
she
had
bribed
the
meter
and
searched
her
purse
for
a
shilling
she
found
that
she
had
florins
and
sixpences
but
she
had
no
shillings
this
of
course
is
the
chronic
condition
of
all
users
of
the
and
she
accepted
the
discovery
with
the
calm
of
the
fatalist
she
considered
should
she
go
out
and
get
change
from
the
obliging
tobacconist
at
the
corner
or
should
she
take
a
chance
if
i
do
go
out
you
will
she
said
addressing
the
light
and
it
winked
ominously
she
opened
the
door
and
stepped
into
the
passage
and
as
she
did
so
the
lights
behind
her
went
out
there
was
one
small
lamp
on
the
landing
a
plutocratic
affair
independent
of
shilling
meters
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
walked
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
as
she
passed
no
she
noted
the
door
was
ajar
and
she
stopped
she
did
not
wish
to
risk
meeting
the
drunkard
and
she
turned
back
then
she
remembered
the
doctor
he
lived
in
no
usually
when
he
was
at
home
there
was
a
light
in
his
hall
which
showed
through
the
fanlight
now
however
the
place
was
in
darkness
she
saw
a
card
on
the
door
and
walking
closer
she
read
it
in
the
dim
light
back
at
wait
he
was
out
and
was
evidently
expecting
a
caller
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
risk
meeting
the
exuberant
beale
she
flew
down
the
stairs
and
gained
the
street
with
a
feeling
of
relief
the
obliging
tobacconist
who
was
loquacious
on
the
subject
of
germans
and
germany
detained
her
until
her
stock
of
patience
was
exhausted
but
at
last
she
made
her
escape
across
the
street
she
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
standing
in
the
dark
hallway
of
the
chambers
and
her
heart
sank
matilda
you
a
fool
she
said
to
herself
her
name
was
not
matilda
but
in
moments
of
she
was
wont
to
address
herself
as
such
she
walked
boldly
up
to
the
entrance
and
passed
through
the
man
she
saw
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
but
did
not
recognize
he
seemed
as
little
desirous
of
attracting
attention
as
she
she
thought
he
was
rather
stout
and
short
but
as
to
this
she
was
not
sure
she
raced
up
the
stairs
and
turned
on
the
landing
to
her
room
the
door
of
no
was
still
ajar
but
what
was
much
more
important
so
was
her
door
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
between
the
edge
of
the
door
and
the
jamb
there
was
a
good
two
inches
of
space
and
she
distinctly
remembered
not
only
closing
it
but
also
pushing
it
to
make
sure
that
it
was
fast
what
should
she
do
to
her
annoyance
she
felt
a
cold
little
feeling
inside
her
and
her
hands
were
trembling
if
the
lights
were
only
on
i
take
the
risk
she
thought
but
the
lights
were
not
on
and
it
was
necessary
to
pass
into
the
dark
interior
and
into
a
darker
a
room
which
is
notoriously
adaptable
for
murder
before
she
could
reach
the
meter
rubbish
matilda
she
scoffed
quaveringly
go
in
you
frightened
little
rabbit
you
forgot
to
shut
the
door
that
all
she
pushed
the
door
open
and
with
a
shiver
stepped
inside
then
a
sound
made
her
stop
dead
it
was
a
shuffle
and
a
creak
such
as
a
dog
might
make
if
he
brushed
against
the
chair
who
there
she
demanded
there
was
no
reply
who
there
she
took
one
step
forward
and
then
something
reached
out
at
her
a
big
hand
gripped
her
by
the
sleeve
of
her
blouse
and
she
heard
a
deep
breathing
she
bit
her
lips
to
stop
the
scream
that
arose
and
with
a
wrench
tore
herself
free
leaving
a
portion
of
a
sleeve
in
the
hands
of
the
unknown
she
darted
backward
slamming
the
door
behind
her
in
two
flying
strides
she
was
at
the
door
of
no
hammering
with
both
her
fists
drunk
or
sober
he
is
a
man
drunk
or
sober
he
is
a
man
she
muttered
incoherently
only
twice
she
beat
upon
the
door
when
it
opened
suddenly
and
beale
stood
in
the
doorway
what
is
it
she
hardly
noticed
his
tone
a
man
a
man
in
my
flat
she
gasped
and
showed
her
torn
sleeve
a
man
he
pushed
her
aside
and
made
for
the
door
the
key
he
said
quickly
with
trembling
fingers
she
extracted
it
from
her
pocket
one
moment
he
disappeared
into
his
own
flat
and
presently
came
out
holding
an
electric
torch
he
snapped
back
the
lock
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
and
then
to
her
amazement
he
slipped
a
revolver
from
his
with
his
foot
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
she
watched
him
vanish
into
the
gloomy
interior
presently
came
his
voice
sharp
and
menacing
hands
up
a
voice
jabbered
something
excitedly
and
then
she
heard
beale
speak
is
your
light
working
you
can
come
in
i
have
him
in
the
she
stepped
into
the
the
shilling
dropped
through
the
aperture
the
screw
grated
as
she
turned
it
and
the
lights
sprang
to
life
in
one
corner
of
the
room
was
a
man
a
sickly
looking
man
with
a
head
too
big
for
his
body
his
hands
were
above
his
head
his
lower
lip
trembled
in
terror
beale
was
searching
him
with
thoroughness
and
rapidity
no
gun
all
right
put
your
hands
down
now
turn
out
your
pockets
the
man
said
something
in
a
language
which
the
girl
could
not
understand
and
beale
replied
in
the
same
tongue
he
put
the
contents
first
of
one
pocket
then
of
the
other
upon
the
table
and
the
girl
watched
the
proceedings
with
open
eyes
hello
what
this
beale
picked
up
a
card
thereon
was
scribbled
a
figure
which
might
have
been
or
i
see
said
beale
now
the
other
pocket
you
understand
english
my
friend
stupidly
the
man
obeyed
a
leather
came
from
an
inside
pocket
and
this
beale
opened
therein
was
a
small
packet
which
resembled
the
familiar
wrapper
of
a
seidlitz
powder
beale
spoke
sharply
in
a
language
which
the
girl
realized
was
german
and
the
man
shook
his
head
he
said
something
which
sounded
like
no
good
several
times
i
going
to
leave
you
here
alone
for
awhile
said
beale
my
friend
and
i
are
going
downstairs
together
i
shall
not
be
long
they
went
out
of
the
flat
together
the
little
man
with
the
big
head
protesting
and
she
heard
their
footsteps
descending
the
stairs
presently
beale
came
up
alone
and
walked
into
the
and
then
the
strange
unaccountable
fact
dawned
on
her
he
was
perfectly
sober
his
eyes
were
clear
his
lips
firm
and
the
fair
hair
whose
tendencies
to
bedragglement
had
emphasized
his
disgrace
was
brushed
back
over
his
head
he
looked
at
her
so
earnestly
that
she
grew
embarrassed
miss
cresswell
he
said
quietly
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
do
me
a
great
favour
if
it
is
one
that
i
can
grant
you
may
be
sure
that
i
will
she
smiled
and
he
nodded
i
shall
not
ask
you
to
do
anything
that
is
impossible
in
spite
of
the
humorist
view
of
women
he
said
i
merely
want
you
to
tell
nobody
about
what
has
happened
nobody
she
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
but
the
doctor
not
even
the
doctor
he
said
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
i
ask
you
this
as
a
special
favour
word
of
honour
she
thought
a
moment
i
promise
she
said
i
to
tell
nobody
about
that
horrid
man
from
whom
you
so
kindly
saved
me
he
lifted
his
head
understand
this
miss
cresswell
please
he
said
i
do
want
you
to
be
under
any
misapprehension
about
that
man
he
was
just
as
scared
as
you
and
he
would
not
have
harmed
you
i
have
been
waiting
for
him
all
the
evening
waiting
for
him
he
nodded
again
where
in
the
doctor
flat
he
said
calmly
you
see
the
doctor
and
i
are
deadly
rivals
we
are
rival
scientists
and
i
was
waiting
for
the
hairy
man
to
steal
a
march
on
him
but
but
how
did
you
get
in
i
had
this
key
he
said
holding
up
a
small
key
remember
word
of
honour
the
man
whom
i
have
just
left
came
up
and
was
certain
whether
he
had
to
go
in
no
that
the
doctor
or
no
the
one
key
fits
both
doors
he
inserted
the
key
which
was
in
the
lock
of
her
door
and
it
turned
easily
and
this
is
what
i
was
waiting
for
it
was
the
best
the
poor
devil
could
do
he
lifted
the
paper
package
and
broke
the
seals
unfolding
the
paper
carefully
he
laid
it
on
the
table
revealing
a
teaspoonful
of
what
looked
like
fine
green
sawdust
what
is
it
she
whispered
fearfully
somehow
she
knew
that
she
was
in
the
presence
of
a
big
elementary
danger
something
gross
and
terrible
in
its
primitive
force
that
said
beale
choosing
his
words
nicely
that
is
a
passable
imitation
of
the
green
rust
or
as
it
is
to
me
the
green
terror
the
green
rust
what
is
the
green
rust
what
can
it
do
she
asked
in
bewilderment
i
hope
we
shall
never
know
he
said
and
in
his
clear
eyes
was
a
hint
of
terror
chapter
iii
punsonby
discharge
an
employee
oliva
cresswell
rose
with
the
final
despairing
buzz
of
her
alarm
clock
and
conquered
the
almost
irresistible
temptation
to
close
her
eyes
just
to
see
what
it
felt
like
her
first
impression
was
that
she
had
had
no
sleep
all
night
she
remembered
going
to
bed
at
one
and
turning
from
side
to
side
until
three
she
remembered
deciding
that
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
get
up
make
some
tea
and
watch
the
sun
rise
and
that
whilst
she
was
deciding
whether
such
a
step
was
romantic
or
just
silly
she
must
have
gone
to
sleep
still
four
hours
of
slumber
is
practically
no
slumber
to
a
healthy
girl
and
she
swung
her
legs
over
the
side
of
the
bed
and
spent
quite
five
minutes
in
a
fatuous
admiration
of
her
little
white
feet
with
an
effort
she
dragged
herself
to
the
and
let
the
tap
run
then
she
put
on
the
kettle
half
an
hour
later
she
was
feeling
well
but
unenthusiastic
when
she
became
fully
conscious
which
was
on
her
way
to
business
she
realized
she
was
worried
she
had
been
made
a
party
to
a
secret
without
her
wish
and
the
drunken
beale
that
youthful
profligate
had
really
forced
this
confidence
upon
her
only
and
this
she
recalled
with
a
start
which
sent
her
chin
jerking
upward
she
was
in
the
bus
at
the
time
and
the
conductor
thinking
she
was
signalling
him
to
stop
pulled
the
bell
only
beale
was
surprisingly
sober
and
masterful
for
one
so
weak
of
character
ought
she
to
tell
the
doctor
van
heerden
who
had
been
so
good
a
friend
of
hers
it
seemed
disloyal
it
was
disloyal
horribly
disloyal
to
him
to
hide
the
fact
that
beale
had
actually
been
in
the
doctor
room
at
night
but
was
it
a
coincidence
that
the
same
key
opened
her
door
and
the
doctor
if
it
were
so
it
was
an
embarrassing
coincidence
she
must
change
the
locks
without
delay
the
bus
set
her
down
at
the
corner
of
punsonby
great
block
is
one
of
the
most
successful
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
exclusive
in
london
and
oliva
had
indeed
been
fortunate
in
securing
her
present
position
for
employment
at
punsonby
was
almost
equal
to
government
employment
in
its
permanency
as
it
was
certainly
more
lucrative
in
its
pay
as
she
stepped
on
to
the
pavement
she
glanced
up
at
the
big
ornate
clock
she
was
in
good
time
she
said
to
herself
and
was
pushing
open
the
big
glass
door
through
which
employees
pass
to
the
various
departments
when
a
hand
touched
her
gently
on
the
arm
she
turned
in
surprise
to
face
beale
looking
particularly
smart
in
a
grey
suit
a
grey
felt
hat
and
a
large
bunch
of
violets
in
his
buttonhole
excuse
me
miss
cresswell
he
said
pleasantly
may
i
have
one
word
with
you
she
looked
at
him
doubtfully
i
rather
wish
you
had
chosen
another
time
and
another
place
beale
she
said
frankly
he
nodded
i
realize
it
is
rather
embarrassing
he
said
but
unfortunately
my
business
can
not
wait
i
am
a
business
man
you
know
he
smiled
in
spite
of
my
dissolute
habits
she
looked
at
him
closely
for
she
thought
she
detected
a
gentle
mockery
behind
his
words
but
he
was
not
smiling
now
i
wo
keep
you
more
than
two
minutes
he
went
on
but
in
that
two
minutes
i
have
a
great
deal
to
tell
you
i
wo
bore
you
with
the
story
of
my
life
this
time
she
saw
the
amusement
in
his
eyes
and
smiled
against
her
will
because
she
was
not
feeling
particularly
amused
i
have
a
business
in
the
city
of
london
he
said
and
again
i
would
ask
you
to
respect
my
confidence
i
am
a
wheat
expert
a
wheat
expert
she
repeated
with
a
puzzled
frown
it
a
queer
job
is
it
but
that
what
i
am
i
have
a
vacancy
in
my
office
for
a
confidential
secretary
it
is
a
nice
office
the
pay
is
good
the
hours
are
few
and
the
work
is
light
i
want
to
know
whether
you
will
accept
the
position
she
shook
her
head
regarding
him
with
a
new
interest
from
which
suspicion
was
not
altogether
absent
it
is
awfully
kind
of
you
beale
and
adds
another
to
the
debts
i
owe
you
she
said
but
i
have
no
desire
to
leave
punsonby
it
is
work
i
like
and
although
i
am
sure
you
are
not
interested
in
my
private
business
he
could
have
told
her
that
he
was
very
much
interested
in
her
private
business
but
he
refrained
i
do
not
mind
telling
you
that
i
am
earning
a
very
good
salary
and
i
have
no
intention
or
desire
to
change
my
situation
his
eyes
twinkled
ah
well
that
my
misfortune
he
said
there
are
only
two
things
i
can
say
the
first
is
that
if
you
work
for
me
you
will
neither
be
distressed
nor
annoyed
by
any
habits
of
mine
which
you
may
have
observed
and
which
may
perhaps
have
prejudiced
you
against
me
in
the
second
place
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
if
you
ever
leave
punsonby
you
will
give
me
the
first
offer
of
your
services
she
laughed
i
think
you
are
very
funny
beale
but
i
feel
sure
that
you
mean
what
you
say
and
that
you
would
confine
your
er
little
eccentricities
to
times
outside
of
business
hours
as
far
as
leaving
punsonby
is
concerned
i
promise
you
that
i
will
give
you
the
first
offer
of
my
invaluable
services
if
ever
i
leave
and
now
i
am
afraid
i
must
run
away
i
am
awfully
obliged
to
you
for
what
you
did
for
me
last
night
he
looked
at
her
steadily
in
the
eye
i
have
no
recollection
of
anything
that
happened
last
night
he
said
and
i
should
be
glad
if
your
memory
would
suffer
the
same
lapse
he
shook
hands
with
her
lifted
his
hat
and
turned
abruptly
away
and
she
looked
after
him
till
the
boom
of
the
clock
recalled
her
to
the
fact
that
the
head
of
the
firm
of
punsonby
was
a
stickler
for
punctuality
she
went
into
the
great
and
hung
up
her
coat
and
hat
as
she
turned
to
the
mirror
to
straighten
her
hair
she
came
face
to
face
with
a
tall
dark
girl
who
had
been
eyeing
her
thoughtfully
good
morning
said
oliva
and
there
was
in
her
tone
more
of
politeness
than
friendship
for
although
these
two
girls
had
occupied
the
same
office
for
more
than
a
year
there
was
between
them
an
incompatibility
which
no
length
of
acquaintance
could
remove
hilda
glaum
was
of
swiss
extraction
and
something
of
a
mystery
she
was
good
looking
in
a
sulky
saturnine
way
but
her
known
virtues
stopped
short
at
her
appearance
she
neither
invited
nor
gave
confidence
and
in
this
respect
suited
oliva
but
unlike
oliva
she
made
no
friends
entered
into
none
of
the
periodical
movements
amongst
the
girls
was
impervious
to
the
attractions
of
the
river
in
summer
and
of
the
proms
in
winter
neither
visited
nor
received
replied
the
girl
shortly
then
have
you
been
upstairs
no
why
oh
nothing
oliva
mounted
to
the
floor
where
her
little
office
was
she
and
hilda
dealt
with
the
registered
mail
extracted
and
checked
the
money
that
came
from
the
and
sent
on
the
orders
to
the
various
departments
three
sealed
bags
lay
on
her
desk
and
a
youth
from
the
postal
department
waited
to
receive
a
receipt
for
them
this
she
scribbled
after
comparing
the
numbers
attached
to
the
seals
with
those
inscribed
on
the
boy
for
some
reason
hilda
had
not
followed
her
and
she
was
alone
and
had
tumbled
the
contents
of
the
first
bag
on
to
her
desk
when
the
managing
director
of
punsonby
made
a
surprising
appearance
at
the
door
of
her
office
he
was
a
large
stout
and
man
bald
and
bearded
he
enjoyed
an
episcopal
manner
and
had
a
trick
of
pulling
back
his
head
when
he
asked
questions
as
though
he
desired
to
evade
the
full
force
of
the
answer
he
stood
in
the
doorway
and
beckoned
her
out
and
she
went
without
any
premonition
of
what
was
in
store
for
her
ah
miss
cresswell
he
said
i
ah
am
sorry
i
did
not
see
you
before
you
had
taken
off
your
coat
and
hat
will
you
come
to
my
office
certainly
white
said
the
girl
wondering
what
had
happened
he
led
the
way
with
his
majestic
stride
dangling
a
pair
of
by
their
cord
as
a
fastidious
person
might
carry
a
mouse
by
its
tail
and
ushered
her
into
his
office
sit
down
sit
down
miss
cresswell
he
said
and
seating
himself
at
his
desk
he
put
the
tips
of
his
fingers
together
and
looked
up
to
the
ceiling
for
inspiration
i
am
afraid
miss
cresswell
he
said
that
i
have
ah
an
unpleasant
task
an
unpleasant
task
mr
white
she
said
with
a
sinking
feeling
inside
her
he
nodded
i
have
to
tell
you
that
punsonby
no
longer
require
your
services
she
rose
to
her
feet
looking
down
at
him
with
wonder
and
consternation
not
require
my
services
she
said
slowly
do
you
mean
that
i
am
discharged
he
nodded
again
in
lieu
of
a
month
notice
i
will
give
you
a
cheque
for
a
salary
plus
the
unexpired
portion
of
this
week
salary
but
why
am
i
being
discharged
why
why
white
who
had
opened
his
eyes
for
a
moment
to
watch
the
effect
of
his
lightning
stroke
closed
them
again
it
is
not
the
practice
of
punsonby
to
give
any
reason
for
dispensing
with
the
services
of
its
employees
he
said
oracularly
it
is
sufficient
that
i
should
tell
you
that
hitherto
you
have
given
every
satisfaction
but
for
reasons
which
i
am
not
prepared
to
discuss
we
must
dispense
with
your
services
her
head
was
in
a
whirl
she
could
not
grasp
what
had
happened
for
five
years
she
had
worked
in
the
happiest
circumstances
in
this
great
store
where
everybody
had
been
kind
to
her
and
where
her
tasks
had
been
congenial
she
had
never
thought
of
going
elsewhere
she
regarded
herself
as
did
all
the
employees
as
a
fixture
do
i
understand
she
asked
that
i
am
to
leave
at
once
white
nodded
he
pushed
the
cheque
across
the
table
and
she
took
it
up
and
folded
it
mechanically
and
you
are
not
going
to
tell
me
why
white
shook
his
head
punsonby
do
nothing
without
a
good
reason
he
said
solemnly
feeling
that
whatever
happened
he
must
make
a
good
case
for
punsonby
and
that
whoever
was
to
blame
for
this
unhappy
incident
it
was
not
an
august
firm
which
paid
its
fourteen
per
cent
with
monotonous
regularity
we
lack
ah
definite
knowledge
to
proceed
any
further
in
this
matter
than
in
fact
than
we
have
proceeded
definite
knowledge
the
girl
was
all
the
more
bewildered
by
his
cumbersome
diplomacy
definite
knowledge
was
promised
but
has
not
in
fact
has
not
come
to
hand
it
is
all
very
unpleasant
very
unpleasant
and
he
shook
his
head
she
bowed
and
turning
walked
quickly
from
the
room
passed
to
the
lobby
where
her
coat
was
hung
put
on
her
hat
and
left
punsonby
for
ever
it
was
when
she
had
reached
the
street
that
with
a
shock
she
remembered
beale
words
and
she
stood
pinching
her
lip
thoughtfully
had
he
known
why
had
he
come
that
morning
hours
before
he
was
ordinarily
visible
if
the
common
gossip
of
krooman
mansions
be
worthy
of
credence
and
then
as
though
to
cap
the
amazing
events
of
the
morning
she
saw
him
he
was
standing
on
the
corner
of
the
street
leaning
on
his
cane
smoking
a
long
cigarette
through
a
much
longer
holder
and
he
seemed
wholly
absorbed
in
watching
a
linesman
perched
high
above
the
street
repairing
a
telegraph
wire
she
made
a
step
toward
him
but
stopped
he
was
so
evidently
engrossed
in
the
acrobatics
of
the
honest
workman
in
that
he
could
not
have
seen
her
and
she
turned
swiftly
and
walked
the
other
way
she
had
not
reached
the
end
of
the
block
before
he
was
at
her
side
you
are
going
home
early
miss
cresswell
he
smiled
she
turned
to
him
do
you
know
why
she
asked
i
do
know
why
unless
unless
what
unless
you
have
been
discharged
he
said
coolly
her
brows
knit
what
do
you
know
about
my
discharge
she
asked
such
things
are
possible
said
beale
did
you
know
i
was
going
to
be
discharged
she
asked
again
he
nodded
i
did
exactly
know
you
would
be
discharged
this
morning
but
i
had
an
idea
you
would
be
discharged
at
some
time
or
other
that
is
why
i
came
with
my
offer
which
of
course
i
wo
accept
she
snapped
which
of
course
you
have
accepted
he
said
quietly
believe
me
i
know
nothing
more
than
that
punsonby
have
been
prevailed
upon
to
discharge
you
what
reason
induced
them
to
take
that
step
honestly
i
do
know
but
why
did
you
think
so
he
was
grave
of
a
sudden
i
just
thought
so
he
said
i
am
not
going
to
be
mysterious
with
you
and
i
can
only
tell
you
that
i
had
reasons
to
believe
that
some
such
step
would
be
taken
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
wearily
it
is
quite
mysterious
enough
she
said
do
you
seriously
want
me
to
work
for
you
he
nodded
you
did
tell
me
your
city
address
that
is
why
i
came
back
he
said
then
you
knew
i
was
coming
out
i
knew
you
would
come
out
some
time
in
the
day
she
stared
at
him
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
would
have
waited
all
day
to
give
me
your
address
he
laughed
i
only
mean
this
he
replied
that
i
should
have
waited
all
day
it
was
a
helpless
laugh
which
echoed
his
my
address
is
lothbury
he
went
on
you
may
begin
work
this
afternoon
and
he
hesitated
and
she
repeated
and
i
think
it
would
be
wise
if
you
did
tell
your
friend
the
doctor
that
i
am
employing
you
he
was
examining
his
attentively
as
he
spoke
and
he
did
not
meet
her
eye
there
are
many
reasons
he
went
on
in
the
first
place
i
have
blotted
my
as
they
say
in
krooman
mansions
and
it
might
not
rebound
to
your
credit
you
should
have
thought
of
that
before
you
asked
me
to
come
to
you
she
said
i
thought
of
it
a
great
deal
he
replied
calmly
there
was
much
in
what
he
said
as
the
girl
recognized
she
blamed
herself
for
her
hasty
promise
but
somehow
the
events
of
the
previous
night
had
placed
him
on
a
different
footing
had
given
him
a
certain
indefinable
position
to
which
the
inebriate
beale
had
not
aspired
i
am
afraid
i
am
rather
bewildered
by
all
the
mystery
of
it
she
said
and
i
do
think
i
will
come
to
the
office
morning
at
what
hour
ten
he
said
i
will
be
there
to
explain
your
duties
your
salary
will
be
a
week
you
will
be
in
charge
of
the
office
to
which
i
very
seldom
go
by
the
way
and
your
work
will
be
preparing
statistical
returns
of
the
in
all
the
of
the
world
for
the
last
fifty
years
it
sounds
thrilling
she
said
and
a
quick
smile
flashed
across
his
face
it
is
much
more
thrilling
than
you
imagine
were
his
parting
words
she
reached
krooman
mansions
just
as
the
doctor
was
coming
out
and
he
looked
at
her
in
surprise
you
are
back
early
should
she
tell
him
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
he
had
been
a
good
friend
of
hers
and
she
felt
sure
of
his
sympathy
it
occurred
to
her
at
that
moment
that
beale
had
been
most
unsympathetic
and
had
not
expressed
one
word
of
regret
yes
i
been
discharged
she
exclaimed
discharged
impossible
she
nodded
to
prove
that
it
is
possible
it
has
happened
she
said
cheerfully
my
dear
girl
this
is
monstrous
what
excuse
did
they
give
none
this
was
said
with
a
lightness
of
tone
which
did
not
reflect
the
indignation
she
felt
at
heart
did
they
give
you
no
reason
they
gave
me
none
they
gave
me
my
month
cheque
and
just
told
me
to
go
off
and
off
i
came
like
the
i
am
but
it
is
monstrous
he
said
indignantly
i
will
go
and
see
them
i
know
one
of
the
heads
of
the
firm
at
least
he
is
a
patient
of
mine
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
she
replied
firmly
it
really
does
matter
what
are
you
going
to
do
by
jove
he
said
suddenly
what
a
splendid
idea
i
want
a
clinical
secretary
the
humour
of
it
got
the
better
of
her
and
she
laughed
in
his
face
what
is
the
joke
he
asked
oh
i
am
so
sorry
doctor
but
you
must
think
i
am
ungrateful
but
i
am
beginning
to
regard
myself
as
one
of
the
plums
in
the
labour
market
have
you
another
position
he
asked
quickly
i
have
just
accepted
one
she
said
and
he
did
not
disguise
his
disappointment
which
might
even
have
been
interpreted
were
oliva
more
conceited
into
absolute
chagrin
you
are
very
quick
said
he
and
his
voice
had
lost
some
of
its
enthusiasm
what
position
have
you
taken
i
am
going
into
an
office
in
the
city
she
said
that
will
be
dull
if
you
have
settled
it
in
your
mind
of
course
i
can
not
alter
your
decision
but
i
would
be
quite
willing
to
give
you
or
a
week
and
the
work
would
be
very
light
she
held
out
her
hand
and
there
was
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
london
is
simply
filled
with
people
who
want
to
give
me
a
week
for
work
which
is
very
light
really
i
am
awfully
grateful
to
you
doctor
she
felt
more
cheerful
as
she
mounted
the
stairs
than
she
thought
would
have
been
possible
had
such
a
position
been
forecast
and
had
she
to
speculate
upon
the
attitude
of
mind
with
which
she
would
meet
such
a
misfortune
punsonby
for
all
the
humiliation
of
her
dismissal
seemed
fairly
unimportant
some
day
she
would
discover
the
circumstances
which
had
decided
the
high
gods
who
presided
over
the
clothing
business
in
their
action
she
unlocked
the
door
and
passed
in
not
without
a
comprehensive
and
an
amused
glance
which
took
in
the
sober
front
doors
of
her
new
employer
and
her
employer
sarah
your
luck
in
she
said
as
she
banged
the
door
sarah
was
the
approving
version
of
matilda
if
the
wheezy
man
fires
you
be
sure
there
be
a
good
angel
waiting
on
the
doorstep
to
offer
you
a
week
for
the
office
once
a
day
it
occurred
to
her
that
it
would
be
wise
to
place
on
record
her
protest
against
her
summary
dismissal
and
she
went
to
the
little
where
she
kept
her
to
indite
the
epistle
whilst
she
thought
of
it
it
was
one
of
those
little
contraptions
where
the
desk
is
formed
by
a
hinged
flap
which
serves
when
not
in
use
to
close
the
desk
she
pulled
out
the
two
little
supports
inserted
the
key
in
the
lock
but
it
refused
to
turn
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
was
unlocked
she
had
distinctly
remembered
that
morning
locking
it
after
putting
away
the
bill
which
had
arrived
with
the
morning
post
she
pulled
down
the
flap
slowly
and
stared
in
amazement
at
the
little
which
it
hid
every
had
been
ransacked
and
the
contents
were
piled
up
in
a
confused
heap
the
two
tiny
drawers
in
which
she
kept
stamps
and
nibs
were
out
and
emptied
chapter
iv
the
letters
that
were
not
there
she
made
a
rapid
survey
of
the
documents
they
were
unimportant
and
consisted
mainly
of
letters
from
the
few
girl
friends
she
had
made
during
her
stay
at
punsonby
old
theatre
programmes
recipes
copied
from
newspapers
and
bunches
of
snapshots
taken
on
her
last
summer
excursion
she
arranged
the
things
in
some
sort
of
rough
order
and
made
an
inspection
of
her
bedroom
here
too
there
was
evidence
that
somebody
had
been
searching
the
room
the
drawers
of
her
were
open
and
though
the
contents
had
been
little
disturbed
it
was
clear
that
they
had
been
searched
she
made
another
discovery
the
window
of
the
bedroom
was
open
at
the
bottom
usually
it
was
open
down
from
the
top
and
was
fastened
in
that
position
by
a
patent
catch
this
precaution
was
necessary
because
the
window
looked
upon
a
narrow
iron
parapet
which
ran
along
the
building
and
communicated
with
the
she
looked
out
evidently
the
intruder
had
both
come
and
gone
this
way
and
as
evidently
her
return
had
disturbed
him
in
his
inspection
for
it
was
hardly
likely
he
would
leave
her
papers
and
bureau
in
that
state
of
confusion
she
made
a
brief
inspection
of
the
drawers
in
the
and
so
far
as
she
could
see
nothing
was
missing
she
went
back
to
the
mechanically
put
away
the
papers
little
and
letters
which
had
been
dragged
from
their
then
resting
her
elbow
on
the
desk
she
sat
chin
in
hand
her
pretty
forehead
wrinkled
in
a
frown
recalling
the
events
of
the
morning
who
had
searched
her
desk
what
did
they
hope
to
discover
she
had
no
illusions
that
this
was
the
work
of
a
common
thief
there
was
something
behind
all
this
something
sinister
and
terrifying
what
association
had
the
search
with
her
summary
dismissal
and
what
did
the
pompous
white
mean
when
he
talked
about
definite
knowledge
definite
knowledge
of
what
she
gave
it
up
with
a
shrug
she
was
not
as
much
alarmed
as
disturbed
life
was
grating
a
little
and
she
resented
this
departure
from
the
smooth
course
which
it
had
hitherto
run
she
resented
the
intrusion
of
beale
who
was
drunk
one
moment
and
sober
the
next
who
had
offices
in
the
city
which
he
did
not
visit
and
who
took
such
an
inordinate
interest
in
her
affairs
and
she
resented
him
all
the
more
because
in
some
indefinable
way
he
had
shaken
her
faith
no
not
shaken
her
faith
that
was
too
strong
a
term
he
had
pared
the
mild
romance
which
van
heerden
friendship
represented
she
got
up
from
the
table
and
paced
the
room
planning
her
day
she
would
go
out
to
lunch
and
indulge
in
the
dissipation
of
a
matinee
perhaps
she
would
stay
out
to
dinner
and
come
back
she
shivered
unconsciously
and
looked
round
the
room
somehow
she
did
not
look
forward
to
an
evening
spent
alone
in
her
flat
matilda
you
getting
maudlin
she
said
you
are
getting
romantic
too
you
are
reading
too
many
sensational
novels
and
seeing
too
many
sensational
films
she
walked
briskly
into
her
bedroom
unhooked
a
suit
from
the
wardrobe
and
laid
it
on
the
bed
at
that
moment
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
she
put
down
the
which
was
in
her
hand
walked
out
into
the
hall
opened
the
door
and
stepped
back
three
men
stood
in
the
passage
without
two
were
strangers
with
that
curious
official
look
which
the
policeman
can
never
wholly
eradicate
from
his
bearing
the
third
was
white
more
pompous
and
more
solemn
than
ever
miss
cresswell
asked
one
of
the
strangers
that
is
my
name
may
we
come
inside
i
want
to
see
you
she
led
the
way
to
her
little
white
followed
in
the
rear
your
name
is
oliva
cresswell
you
were
recently
employed
by
punsonby
limited
as
cashier
that
is
true
she
said
wondering
what
was
coming
next
certain
information
was
laid
against
you
said
the
spokesman
as
a
result
of
which
you
were
discharged
from
the
firm
this
morning
she
raised
her
eyebrows
in
indignant
surprise
information
laid
against
me
she
said
haughtily
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
a
charge
was
made
against
you
that
you
were
converting
money
belonging
to
the
firm
to
your
own
use
that
was
the
charge
i
believe
sir
he
turned
to
white
white
nodded
slowly
it
is
a
lie
it
is
an
outrageous
lie
cried
the
girl
turning
flaming
eyes
upon
the
stout
managing
director
of
punsonby
you
know
it
a
lie
white
thousands
of
pounds
have
passed
through
my
hands
and
i
have
never
oh
it
cruel
if
you
will
only
keep
calm
for
a
little
while
miss
said
the
man
who
was
not
unused
to
such
outbreaks
i
will
explain
that
at
the
moment
of
your
dismissal
there
was
no
evidence
against
you
no
definite
knowledge
of
your
offence
murmured
white
and
now
demanded
the
girl
now
we
have
information
miss
to
the
effect
that
three
registered
letters
containing
in
all
the
sum
of
fourteen
and
sevenpence
murmured
white
pounds
odd
said
the
detective
which
were
abstracted
by
you
yesterday
are
concealed
in
this
flat
in
the
bottom
drawer
of
your
bureau
murmured
white
that
is
the
definite
knowledge
which
has
come
to
us
it
is
a
great
pity
the
girl
stared
from
one
to
the
other
three
registered
envelopes
she
said
incredulously
in
this
flat
in
the
bottom
drawer
of
your
bureau
mumbled
white
who
stood
throughout
the
interview
with
his
eyes
closed
his
hands
clasped
in
front
of
him
a
picture
of
a
man
performing
a
most
painful
act
of
duty
i
have
a
warrant
began
the
detective
you
need
no
warrant
said
the
girl
quietly
you
are
at
liberty
to
search
this
flat
or
bring
a
woman
to
search
me
i
have
nothing
in
these
rooms
which
i
am
ashamed
that
you
should
see
the
detective
turned
to
his
companion
fred
he
said
just
have
a
look
over
that
is
it
locked
miss
she
had
closed
and
locked
the
secretaire
and
she
handed
the
man
the
key
the
detective
who
had
done
the
speaking
passed
into
the
bedroom
and
the
girl
heard
him
pulling
out
the
drawers
she
did
not
move
from
where
she
stood
confronting
her
late
employer
still
preserving
his
attitude
of
somnolent
detachment
white
she
asked
quietly
i
have
a
right
to
know
who
accused
me
of
stealing
from
your
firm
he
made
no
reply
even
a
criminal
has
a
right
to
that
you
know
she
said
recovering
some
of
her
poise
i
suppose
that
you
have
been
missing
things
for
quite
a
long
while
people
always
miss
things
for
quite
a
long
while
before
the
thief
is
discovered
according
to
the
sunday
papers
i
do
not
read
newspapers
published
on
the
lord
day
said
white
reproachfully
i
do
not
know
the
habits
of
the
criminal
classes
but
as
you
say
and
i
fear
i
must
convey
the
gist
of
your
speech
to
the
officers
of
the
law
money
has
been
missed
from
your
department
for
a
considerable
time
as
to
your
accuser
acting
as
ah
as
a
good
citizen
and
performing
the
duties
which
are
associated
with
i
can
not
reveal
his
her
or
their
name
she
was
eyeing
him
curiously
with
a
gleam
of
dormant
laughter
in
her
clear
eyes
then
she
heard
a
hurried
footstep
in
the
little
passage
and
remembered
that
the
door
had
been
left
open
and
she
looked
round
the
was
van
heerden
what
is
this
i
hear
he
demanded
fiercely
addressing
white
you
dare
accuse
miss
cresswell
of
theft
my
dear
doctor
began
white
it
is
an
outrage
said
the
doctor
it
is
disgraceful
white
i
will
vouch
for
miss
cresswell
with
my
life
the
girl
stopped
him
with
a
laugh
please
do
be
dramatic
doctor
it
really
a
stupid
mistake
i
did
know
you
knew
mr
white
it
is
a
disgraceful
mistake
said
the
doctor
violently
i
am
surprised
at
you
white
white
could
not
close
his
eyes
any
tighter
than
they
were
closed
he
passed
the
responsibility
for
the
situation
upon
an
invisible
providence
with
one
heaving
shrug
of
his
shoulders
it
is
awfully
kind
of
you
to
take
this
interest
doctor
said
the
girl
putting
out
her
hands
to
him
it
was
just
like
you
is
there
anything
i
can
do
he
asked
earnestly
you
can
depend
upon
me
to
the
last
shilling
if
any
trouble
arises
out
of
this
no
trouble
will
arise
out
of
it
she
said
white
thinks
that
i
have
stolen
money
and
that
that
money
is
hidden
in
the
flat
by
the
way
who
told
you
that
i
had
been
accused
for
a
moment
he
was
taken
aback
then
i
saw
the
police
officers
go
into
your
flat
i
recognized
them
and
as
they
were
accompanied
by
white
and
you
had
been
dismissed
this
morning
i
drew
my
own
conclusions
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
detective
came
back
from
the
bedroom
there
nothing
there
he
said
white
opened
his
eyes
to
their
fullest
extent
in
the
bottom
drawer
of
the
bureau
he
asked
incredulously
neither
in
the
bottom
drawer
nor
the
top
drawer
said
the
detective
have
you
found
anything
fred
nothing
said
the
other
man
have
a
look
behind
those
pictures
they
turned
up
the
corners
of
the
carpets
searched
her
one
little
bookcase
looked
under
the
tables
an
unnecessary
and
amusing
proceeding
in
the
girl
eyes
till
the
detective
explained
with
that
display
of
friendliness
which
all
policemen
show
to
suspected
persons
whom
they
do
not
at
heart
suspect
it
was
not
an
uncommon
process
for
criminals
to
tack
the
proceeds
of
robberies
to
the
underside
of
the
table
well
miss
said
the
detective
at
last
with
a
smile
i
hope
we
have
worried
you
very
much
what
do
you
intend
doing
sir
he
addressed
white
did
you
search
the
bottom
drawer
of
the
bureau
said
white
again
i
searched
the
bottom
drawer
of
the
bureau
the
top
drawer
and
the
middle
drawer
said
the
detective
patiently
i
searched
the
back
of
the
bureau
the
the
and
it
was
not
there
said
white
as
though
he
could
not
believe
his
ears
it
was
not
there
what
i
want
to
know
is
do
you
charge
this
young
lady
if
you
charge
her
of
course
you
take
all
the
responsibility
for
the
act
and
if
you
fail
to
convict
her
you
will
be
liable
to
an
action
for
false
arrest
i
know
i
know
i
know
said
white
with
remarkable
asperity
in
one
so
placid
no
i
do
not
charge
her
i
am
sorry
you
have
been
inconvenienced
he
turned
to
the
girl
in
his
most
majestic
manner
and
i
trust
that
you
bear
no
he
offered
a
large
and
flabby
hand
but
oliva
ignored
it
mind
you
do
trip
over
the
mat
as
you
go
out
she
said
the
passage
is
rather
dark
white
left
the
room
breathing
heavily
excuse
me
one
moment
said
the
doctor
in
a
low
voice
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
white
please
do
make
a
fuss
said
oliva
i
would
rather
the
matter
dropped
where
it
is
he
nodded
and
strode
out
after
the
managing
director
of
punsonby
they
made
a
little
group
of
four
can
i
see
you
in
my
flat
for
a
moment
mr
white
certainly
said
white
cheerfully
you
do
want
us
any
more
asked
the
detective
no
said
white
then
are
you
quite
sure
you
searched
the
bottom
drawer
of
the
bureau
perfectly
sure
said
the
detective
irritably
you
do
suppose
been
at
this
job
for
twenty
years
and
should
overlook
the
one
place
where
i
expected
to
find
the
letters
white
was
saved
the
labour
of
framing
a
suitable
retort
for
the
door
of
beale
flat
was
flung
open
and
beale
came
forth
his
grey
hat
was
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
he
stood
erect
with
the
aid
of
the
surveying
with
a
bland
and
inane
smile
the
little
knot
of
men
why
he
said
jovially
it
the
dear
old
doctor
and
if
my
eyes
deceive
me
it
the
jolly
old
archbishop
white
brindled
that
he
was
known
as
the
archbishop
in
the
intimate
circles
of
his
acquaintances
afforded
him
a
certain
satisfaction
that
a
perfect
stranger
and
a
perfectly
drunken
stranger
at
that
should
employ
a
nickname
which
was
for
the
use
of
a
privileged
few
distressed
him
and
said
the
swaying
man
by
the
door
peering
through
the
is
it
not
peterson
and
constable
fairbank
welcome
to
this
home
of
virtue
the
smiled
but
said
nothing
the
doctor
fingered
his
beard
indecisively
but
white
essayed
to
stride
past
his
chin
in
the
air
ignoring
the
greeting
but
beale
was
too
quick
for
him
he
lurched
forward
caught
the
lapels
of
the
other
immaculate
and
held
himself
erect
thereby
my
dear
old
whitey
he
said
i
do
know
you
sir
cried
white
will
you
please
unhand
me
do
know
me
whitey
why
you
astonishing
old
thing
he
slipped
his
arm
over
the
other
shoulder
in
an
attitude
of
affectionate
regard
do
know
old
beale
i
never
met
you
before
said
white
struggling
to
escape
bless
my
life
and
soul
said
beale
stepping
back
shocked
and
hurt
i
call
you
to
witnesh
peterson
and
amiable
constable
fairbank
and
learned
van
heerden
that
he
has
denied
me
and
it
has
come
to
this
he
said
bitterly
and
leaning
his
head
against
the
he
howled
like
a
dog
i
say
stop
your
fooling
beale
said
the
doctor
angrily
been
very
serious
business
here
and
i
should
thank
you
not
to
interfere
beale
wiped
imaginary
tears
from
his
eyes
grasped
unwilling
hand
and
shook
it
vigorously
staggered
back
to
his
flat
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
do
you
know
that
man
asked
the
doctor
turning
to
the
detective
i
seem
to
remember
his
face
said
the
sergeant
come
on
fred
good
morning
gentlemen
they
waited
till
the
officers
were
downstairs
and
out
of
sight
and
then
the
doctor
turned
to
the
other
and
in
a
different
tone
from
any
he
had
employed
said
come
into
my
room
for
a
moment
white
and
white
followed
him
obediently
they
shut
the
door
and
passed
into
the
study
with
its
rows
of
heavily
bound
books
its
long
table
covered
with
and
the
paraphernalia
of
medical
research
well
said
white
dropping
into
a
chair
what
happened
that
is
what
i
want
to
know
said
the
doctor
he
took
a
cigarette
from
a
box
on
the
table
and
lit
it
and
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
without
speaking
do
you
think
she
had
the
letters
and
hid
them
impossible
replied
the
doctor
briefly
white
grunted
took
a
cigar
from
a
long
leather
case
bit
off
the
end
savagely
and
reached
out
his
hand
for
a
match
schemes
of
mice
and
men
he
quoted
oh
shut
up
said
the
doctor
savagely
he
was
pacing
the
study
with
long
strides
he
stopped
at
one
end
of
the
room
staring
moodily
through
the
window
his
hands
thrust
in
his
pockets
i
wonder
what
happened
he
said
again
well
that
can
wait
now
just
tell
me
exactly
how
matters
stand
in
regard
to
you
and
punsonby
i
have
all
the
figures
here
said
white
as
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
inside
pocket
of
his
i
can
raise
by
debentures
and
hello
what
this
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
white
packet
fastened
about
by
a
rubber
band
this
he
slipped
off
and
gasped
for
in
his
hands
were
three
registered
letters
and
they
were
addressed
to
punsonby
and
each
had
been
slit
open
chapter
v
the
man
with
the
big
head
no
lothbury
is
a
block
of
business
offices
somewhat
unpretentious
in
their
approach
but
of
surprising
depth
and
importance
when
explored
oliva
cresswell
stood
for
awhile
in
the
great
lobby
inspecting
the
names
of
the
occupants
which
were
inscribed
on
porcelain
slips
in
two
big
frames
on
each
wall
of
the
vestibule
after
a
lengthy
search
she
discovered
the
name
of
the
beale
agency
under
the
heading
fourth
floor
and
made
her
way
to
the
elevator
beale
office
was
at
the
end
of
a
seemingly
interminable
corridor
and
consisted
as
she
was
to
find
of
an
outer
and
an
inner
chamber
the
outer
was
simply
furnished
with
a
table
two
chairs
and
a
railed
fence
bisected
with
a
little
wooden
gateway
a
boy
sat
at
one
table
engaged
in
laborious
exercise
on
a
typewriter
with
one
finger
of
one
hand
he
jumped
up
as
she
came
through
the
door
miss
cresswell
he
asked
beale
will
see
you
he
opened
the
and
led
the
way
to
a
door
marked
private
it
was
beale
who
opened
the
door
in
response
to
the
knock
come
in
miss
cresswell
he
said
cheerily
i
did
expect
you
for
half
an
hour
i
thought
i
start
well
she
smiled
she
had
had
many
misgivings
that
morning
and
had
spent
a
restless
night
debating
the
wisdom
of
engaging
herself
to
an
employer
whose
known
weakness
had
made
his
name
a
but
a
promise
was
a
promise
and
after
all
she
told
herself
her
promise
was
fulfilled
when
she
had
given
the
new
work
a
trial
here
is
your
desk
he
said
indicating
a
large
office
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
here
is
my
little
library
you
will
note
that
it
mainly
consists
of
agricultural
returns
and
reports
do
you
read
french
she
nodded
good
and
spanish
that
rather
too
much
to
expect
is
it
i
speak
and
read
spanish
very
well
she
said
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
lived
around
in
paris
lyons
and
barcelona
my
first
regular
work
the
first
i
was
paid
for
was
in
the
cable
office
in
barcelona
that
lucky
he
said
apparently
relieved
though
i
could
have
taught
you
the
few
words
that
it
is
necessary
you
should
know
to
understand
the
argentine
reports
what
i
particularly
want
you
to
discover
and
you
will
find
two
or
three
hundred
local
on
that
shelf
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
and
these
will
help
you
a
great
deal
is
the
exact
locations
of
all
the
big
districts
the
number
of
hectares
under
cultivation
in
normal
times
the
method
by
which
the
wheat
areas
are
divided
by
fences
roads
the
average
size
of
the
unbroken
blocks
of
wheatland
and
if
possible
the
width
of
the
roads
or
paths
which
divide
them
gracious
she
cried
in
dismay
it
sounds
a
monumental
business
but
i
think
you
will
find
it
simple
the
agricultural
department
of
the
united
states
government
for
instance
tabulate
all
those
facts
for
example
they
compel
farmers
in
certain
districts
to
keep
a
clear
space
between
each
lot
so
that
in
case
of
the
crops
being
fired
the
fire
may
be
isolated
canada
the
argentine
and
australia
have
other
methods
she
had
seated
herself
at
the
desk
and
was
jotting
down
a
note
of
her
duties
anything
more
she
asked
yes
i
want
the
names
of
the
towns
in
the
centre
of
the
areas
a
list
of
the
hotels
in
those
towns
the
you
will
find
up
to
date
and
these
will
inform
you
on
this
subject
particularly
do
i
want
hotels
noted
where
automobiles
can
be
hired
the
address
of
the
local
bank
and
the
name
of
the
manager
and
where
the
information
is
available
the
name
of
the
chief
constable
sheriff
or
chef
in
each
district
she
looked
up
at
him
her
pencil
poised
are
you
serious
of
course
i
do
all
this
but
somehow
it
reminds
me
of
a
story
i
once
read
i
know
it
said
beale
promptly
it
is
case
of
the
man
one
of
doyle
stories
about
a
man
who
to
keep
him
away
from
his
shop
was
employed
on
the
useless
task
of
copying
the
no
i
am
asking
you
to
do
serious
work
miss
cresswell
work
which
i
do
not
want
spoken
about
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
table
looking
down
at
her
and
if
his
eyes
were
smiling
it
was
because
that
was
their
natural
expression
she
had
never
seen
them
when
they
did
not
hold
the
ghost
of
some
joke
inwardly
enjoyed
but
her
instinct
told
her
that
he
was
very
much
in
earnest
and
that
the
task
he
had
set
her
was
one
which
had
reason
behind
it
take
the
districts
first
and
work
up
the
hotels
et
cetera
he
suggested
you
will
find
it
more
interesting
than
a
novel
those
little
books
he
pointed
to
the
crowded
shelf
by
the
window
will
carry
you
to
stations
and
ranches
and
farms
all
over
the
world
you
shall
be
wafted
through
manitoba
and
cross
the
united
states
from
new
england
to
california
you
will
know
sydney
and
melbourne
and
the
great
cornland
at
the
back
of
beyond
and
you
sit
in
cool
patios
and
sip
iced
drinks
with
señor
don
perfecto
de
cuba
who
has
ridden
in
from
his
rancio
to
inquire
the
price
of
may
wheat
or
maybe
you
just
amble
through
india
on
an
elephant
sleeping
in
bungalows
listening
to
the
howling
of
tigers
mosquitoes
now
i
know
you
laughing
at
me
she
smiled
not
altogether
he
said
quietly
then
is
there
any
question
like
to
ask
me
by
the
way
the
key
of
the
office
is
in
the
drawer
go
to
lunch
when
you
like
and
stay
away
as
long
as
you
like
your
cheque
will
be
paid
you
every
friday
morning
but
where
she
looked
round
the
room
where
do
you
work
i
do
work
he
said
promptly
you
do
the
work
and
i
get
the
honour
and
glory
when
i
come
in
i
will
sit
on
the
edge
of
your
desk
which
is
not
graceful
but
it
is
very
comfortable
there
is
one
question
i
meant
to
ask
you
you
said
you
were
in
a
cable
office
do
you
add
to
your
accomplishments
a
working
knowledge
of
the
morse
code
she
nodded
i
can
see
you
being
useful
if
you
need
me
he
jerked
his
head
toward
a
telephone
on
a
small
table
call
gerrard
and
where
is
that
she
asked
if
i
thought
you
were
anything
but
a
very
sane
young
lady
i
should
tell
you
that
it
is
the
number
of
my
favourite
bar
he
said
gravely
i
will
not
however
practise
that
harmless
deception
upon
you
again
she
saw
the
dancing
light
of
mischief
in
his
eyes
you
a
queer
man
she
said
and
i
will
not
make
myself
ridiculous
by
speaking
to
you
for
your
good
she
heard
his
soft
laughter
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
and
gathering
an
armful
of
the
she
settled
down
for
a
morning
work
which
proved
even
more
fascinating
than
his
fanciful
pictures
had
suggested
she
found
herself
wondering
to
what
use
all
this
information
she
extracted
could
be
put
was
beale
really
a
buyer
or
was
he
interested
in
the
sale
of
agricultural
machinery
why
should
he
want
to
know
that
jonas
scobbs
was
the
proprietor
of
scobbs
hotel
and
general
emporium
in
the
town
of
red
horse
valley
alberta
and
what
significance
attached
to
the
fact
that
he
had
an
automobile
for
hire
or
that
he
ran
a
coach
every
wednesday
to
regina
then
she
fell
to
speculating
upon
the
identity
and
appearance
of
this
man
who
bore
this
weird
name
of
scobbs
she
pictured
him
an
elderly
man
with
chin
whiskers
who
wore
his
pants
thrust
into
and
why
was
red
horse
valley
so
called
these
unexpected
and
to
her
hitherto
unknown
names
of
places
and
people
set
in
train
most
interesting
processions
of
thought
that
slid
through
the
noisy
jangle
of
traffic
and
coloured
the
drab
walls
of
all
that
was
visible
of
the
city
of
london
through
the
window
with
the
white
lights
and
purple
shadows
of
dream
prairies
when
she
looked
at
her
watch
being
impelled
to
that
act
by
the
indescribable
sensation
of
hunger
she
was
amazed
to
discover
that
it
was
three
she
jumped
up
and
went
to
the
outer
office
in
search
of
the
boy
who
she
faintly
remembered
had
erupted
into
her
presence
hours
before
with
a
request
which
she
had
granted
without
properly
hearing
he
was
not
in
evidence
evidently
his
petition
had
also
been
associated
with
the
gnawing
pangs
which
assail
boyhood
at
one
in
the
afternoon
she
was
turning
back
to
her
office
undecided
as
to
whether
she
should
remain
until
his
return
or
close
the
office
entirely
when
the
shuffle
of
feet
brought
her
round
the
outer
office
was
partitioned
from
the
entrance
by
a
long
fence
the
farther
end
of
which
was
hidden
by
a
screen
of
wood
and
frosted
glass
it
was
from
behind
that
screen
that
the
noise
came
and
she
remembered
that
she
had
noted
a
chair
there
evidently
a
place
where
callers
waited
who
is
there
she
asked
there
was
a
creak
as
the
visitor
rose
eggscuse
mattam
said
a
wheezy
voice
i
gall
to
for
mister
peale
is
it
he
shuffled
forward
into
view
a
small
man
with
a
dead
white
face
and
a
head
of
monstrous
size
she
was
bereft
of
speech
and
could
only
look
at
him
for
this
was
the
man
she
had
found
in
her
rooms
the
night
before
her
dismissal
the
man
who
carried
the
green
rust
evidently
he
did
not
recognize
her
mister
peale
he
tolt
me
i
must
gall
him
mit
der
telephone
but
der
nomber
she
vas
gone
oudt
of
mine
head
he
blinked
at
her
with
his
eyes
and
laid
a
big
hairy
hand
on
the
gate
you
must
you
must
come
in
she
said
breathlessly
i
will
call
beale
sit
sit
down
again
sch
he
said
obediently
and
shuffled
back
to
his
chair
dell
him
der
herr
brofessor
it
was
the
girl
took
up
the
telephone
receiver
with
a
shaking
hand
and
gave
the
number
it
was
beale
voice
that
answered
her
there
a
man
here
she
said
hurriedly
a
a
the
man
who
was
in
my
room
the
herr
professor
she
heard
his
exclamation
of
annoyance
i
sorry
and
if
she
could
judge
by
the
inflection
of
his
voice
his
sorrow
was
genuine
i
be
with
you
in
ten
minutes
he
quite
a
harmless
old
gentleman
hurry
please
she
heard
the
click
of
his
receiver
and
replaced
her
own
slowly
she
did
not
attempt
to
go
back
to
the
outer
office
but
waited
by
the
closed
door
she
recalled
the
night
the
terror
of
that
unknown
presence
in
her
darkened
flat
and
shuddered
then
beale
surprisingly
sober
had
come
in
and
he
and
the
burglar
had
gone
away
together
what
had
these
two
beale
and
the
herr
professor
in
common
she
heard
the
snap
of
the
outer
door
and
beale
voice
speaking
quickly
it
was
probably
german
she
had
never
acquired
the
language
and
hardly
recognized
it
though
the
guttural
zu
befel
herr
peale
was
distinct
she
heard
the
shuffle
of
the
man
feet
and
the
closing
of
the
outer
door
and
then
beale
came
in
and
his
face
was
troubled
i
ca
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
that
the
old
man
called
i
forgotten
that
he
was
likely
to
come
she
leant
against
the
table
both
hands
behind
her
beale
she
said
will
you
give
me
straightforward
answers
to
a
number
of
plain
questions
he
nodded
if
i
can
he
said
is
the
herr
professor
a
friend
of
yours
no
i
know
him
and
in
a
way
i
am
sorry
for
him
he
is
a
german
who
pretends
to
be
russian
immensely
poor
and
unprepossessing
to
a
painful
degree
but
a
very
clever
scientist
in
fact
a
truly
great
analytical
chemist
who
ought
to
be
holding
a
good
position
he
told
me
that
he
had
the
best
qualifications
and
i
quite
believe
him
but
that
his
physical
infirmities
his
very
freakishness
had
ruined
him
her
eyes
softened
with
pity
the
pity
of
the
strong
for
the
weak
of
the
beautiful
for
the
hideous
if
that
is
true
she
began
and
his
chin
went
up
i
beg
your
pardon
i
know
it
is
true
it
is
tragic
but
did
you
know
him
before
you
met
him
in
my
room
he
hesitated
i
knew
him
both
by
repute
and
by
sight
he
said
i
knew
the
work
he
was
engaged
on
and
i
guessed
why
he
was
engaged
but
i
had
never
spoken
to
him
thank
you
now
for
question
number
two
you
need
answer
unless
you
wish
i
sha
he
said
that
frank
anyway
now
tell
me
beale
what
is
all
this
mystery
about
what
is
the
green
rust
why
do
you
pretend
to
be
a
a
drunkard
when
you
not
one
it
needed
some
boldness
to
say
this
and
she
flushed
with
the
effort
to
shape
the
sentence
why
are
you
always
around
so
providentially
when
you
needed
and
here
she
smiled
as
he
thought
deliciously
why
were
you
round
yesterday
when
i
was
nearly
arrested
for
theft
he
was
back
on
the
edge
of
the
table
evidently
his
favourite
she
thought
and
he
ticked
her
questions
off
on
his
fingers
question
number
one
can
not
be
answered
question
number
two
why
do
i
pretend
to
be
a
a
drunkard
he
mimicked
her
audaciously
there
are
other
things
which
intoxicate
a
man
beside
love
and
beer
miss
cresswell
how
gross
she
protested
what
are
they
work
the
chase
scientific
research
and
the
first
spring
scent
of
the
hawthorn
he
said
solemnly
as
to
the
third
question
why
was
i
not
around
when
you
were
nearly
arrested
well
i
was
around
i
was
in
your
flat
when
you
came
in
and
escaped
along
the
fire
parapet
mr
beale
she
gasped
then
it
was
you
you
are
a
detective
i
turned
your
desk
and
upside
down
yes
it
was
i
he
said
without
shame
ignoring
the
latter
part
of
the
sentence
i
was
looking
for
something
you
were
looking
for
something
she
repeated
what
were
you
looking
for
three
registered
envelopes
which
were
planted
in
your
flat
yesterday
morning
he
said
and
what
more
i
found
she
put
her
hand
to
her
forehead
in
bewilderment
then
you
saved
you
from
a
cold
cold
prison
cell
have
you
had
any
lunch
why
you
starving
but
bread
and
butter
is
what
you
want
said
the
practical
beale
with
a
large
crisp
slice
of
chicken
and
stacks
of
various
vegetables

he
hustled

was
a
man
of

tastes
he
had
a
horror
of
extravagance

it

his
boast
that
he

never

his

punctiliously
paying

dined

in
solitary
state
for

lived
with
him
and
had
died
according
to
the
popularly
accepted
idea
of

for
he
was
a
frugal

it
seems
the
fate
of
apparently
rich
and
frugal
men
that
they
either
die
and
leave
their
hoardings
to
the
state
or
else

disentangles
their

not
discover
the
channel
through
which
their
hundreds
of
thousands
have
poured

if
astute
detectives
bring
back
the
defaulter
from
the
pleasant
life
which
the
southern
american
cities
offer
to
rich
idlers
he
is
hopelessly
vague
as
to
the
method
by
which
it
went
lassimus
white
was
the
managing
director
and
general
manager
of
punsonby
he
held
or
was
supposed
to
hold
a
third
of
the
shares
in
that
concern
shares
which
he
had
inherited
from
john
punsonby
his
uncle
and
the
founder
of
the
firm
he
drew
a
princely
salary
and
a
substantial
dividend
he
was
listed
as
a
debenture
holder
and
was
accounted
a
rich
man
but
white
was
not
rich
his
salary
and
his
dividends
were
absorbed
by
a
mysterious
agency
which
called
itself
the
union
jack
investment
and
mortgage
corporation
which
paid
premiums
on
white
heavy
life
insurance
and
collected
the
whole
or
nearly
the
whole
of
his
income
his
secret
well
guarded
as
it
was
need
be
no
secret
to
the
reader
white
who
had
never
touched
a
in
his
life
and
who
grew
apoplectic
at
the
sin
and
shame
of
playing
the
races
was
an
inveterate
gambler
his
passion
was
for
sunken
treasure
syndicates
formed
to
recover
golden
ingots
from
ships
of
the
spanish
armada
for
companies
that
set
forth
to
harness
the
of
the
sea
to
the
services
of

for

companies
that
discovered
radium
mines
in
the
ural
mountains
anything
which
promised
a
steady
three
hundred
per
cent
per
annum
on
an
initial
investment
had
an
irresistible
attraction
for
white
who
argued
that
some
day
something
would
really
fulfil
expectations
and
his
losses
would
be
recovered
in
the
meantime
he
was
in

corporation
licensed
and
registered
as
a
moneylender
according

and
being
in
the
hands
of
this
gentleman
was
much
less
satisfactory
and
infinitely
more
expensive
than
being
in
the
hands
of
the
bankruptcy
officials
in
the
evening
of
the
day
oliva
cresswell
had
started
working
for
her
new
employer
white
stalked
forth
from
his
gloomy
house
and
his
departure
was
watched
by
the
two
tough
females
who
kept
house
for
him
with
every
pleasure
he
strutted
eastward
swinging
his
umbrella
his
head
well
back
his
eyes
his
massive
waistcoat
curving
regally
his
silk
hat
was
pushed
back
from
his
forehead
and
the
he
carried
but
so
seldom
wore
swung
from
the
cord
he
held
before
him
in
that
manner
which
important
men
affect
he
had
often
been
mistaken
for
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
so
learned
and
detached
was
his
bearing
yet
no
speculation
upon
the
origin
of

or
the
function
of

his
mind
at
a
moment
of
great
stress
and
distraction
van

had
arisen
above
his
horizon
and
there
was
something
in
van
heerden
manner
which
inspired
confidence
and
respect
they
had
met
by
accident
at
a
meeting
held
to
liquidate
the
shining
strand
alluvial
gold
mining
company
a
concern
which
had
started
forth
in
the
happiest
circumstances
to
extract
the
fabulous
riches
which
had
been
discovered
by
an
american
philanthropist
he
is
now
selling
real
estate
by
correspondence
on
a
southern
pacific
island
van
heerden
was
not
a
shareholder
but
he
was
intensely
interested
in
the
kind
of
people
who
subscribe
for
shares
in
dreamland
gold
mines
white
had
attended
incognito
his
shares
were
held
in
the
name
of
his
lawyer
who
was
thinking
seriously
of
building
an
annex
to
hold
the
unprofitable
scrip
white
was
gratified
to
discover
a
kindred
soul
who
believed
in
this
kind
of
speculation
it
was
to
the
doctor
apartment
that
he
was
now
walking
that
gentleman
met
him
in
the
entrance
and
accompanied
him
to
his
room
there
was
a
light
in
the
fanlight
of
oliva
flat
for
she
had
brought
some
of
her
work
home
to
finish
but
beale
flat
was
dark
this
the
doctor
noted
before
he
closed
his
own
door
and
switched
on
the
light
well
white
have
you
made
up
your
mind
he
demanded
without
preliminary
i
ah
have
and
i
ah
have
not
said
the
cautious
adventurer
forty
thousand
is
a
lot
of
money
a
fortune
one
might
say
yes
a
fortune
have
you
raised
it
white
sniffed
his
objection
to
this
direct
examination
my
broker
has
very
kindly
realized
the
debentures
i
am
ah
somewhat
indebted
to
him
and
it
was
necessary
to
secure
his
permission
and
yes
i
have
the
money
at
my
bank
he
gazed
benignly
at
the
other
as
one
who
conferred
a
favour
by
the
mere
bestowal
of
his
confidences
first
doctor
forgive
me
if
i
am
a
little
cautious
first
i
say
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
know
a
little
more
about
your
remarkable
scheme
for
remarkable
i
am
sure
it
is
the
doctor
poured
out
a
whisky
and
soda
and
passed
the
glass
to
his
visitor
who
smilingly
waved
it
aside
wine
is
a
mocker
he
said
nothing
stronger
than
cider
has
ever
passed
my
lips
pray
do
not
be
offended
and
yet
i
seem
to
remember
that
you
held
shares
in
the
northern
saloon
trust
said
the
doctor
with
a
little
curl
of
his
bearded
lips
that
said
white
hastily
was
a
purely
commercial
ah
affair
in
business
one
must
exploit
even
the
ah
sins
and
weaknesses
of
our
fellows
as
to
my
scheme
said
the
doctor
changing
the
subject
i
afraid
i
must
ask
you
to
invest
in
the
dark
i
can
promise
you
that
you
will
get
your
capital
back
a
hundred
times
over
i
realize
that
you
have
heard
that
sort
of
thing
before
and
that
my
suggestion
has
all
the
appearance
of
a
confidence
trick
except
that
i
do
not
offer
you
even
the
substantial
security
of
a
gold
brick
i
may
not
use
your
money
i
believe
that
i
shall
not
on
the
other
hand
i
may
if
it
is
to
be
of
any
use
to
me
it
must
be
in
my
hands
very
soon
he
wandered
restlessly
about
the
room
as
he
spoke
and
jerked
his
sentences
out
now
to
white
face
now
over
his
shoulder
i
will
tell
you
this
he
went
on
my
scheme
within
the
narrow
interpretation
of
the
law
is
illegal
do
mistake
me
there
is
no
danger
to
those
who
invest
in
ignorance
i
will
bear
the
full
burden
of
responsibility
you
can
come
in
or
you
can
stay
out
but
if
you
come
in
i
shall
ask
you
never
to
mention
the
name
of
the
enterprise
to
a
living
soul
the
green
rust
syndicate
whispered
white
fearfully
what
ah
is
green
rust
i
have
offered
the
scheme
to
my
to
a
government
but
they
are
scared
of
touching
it
scared
by
jove
he
threw
up
his
arms
to
the
ceiling
and
his
voice
trembled
with
passion
germany
scared
and
there
was
a
time
when
europe
cringed
at
the
clank
of
the
prussian
sword
when
the
lightest
word
of
potsdam
set
ministries
trembling
in
petrograd
and
london
you
told
me
the
other
day
you
were
a
pacifist
during
the
war
and
that
you
sympathized
with
prussia
in
her
humiliation
i
am
a
prussian
why
should
i
deny
it
i
glory
in
the
religion
of
might
i
believe
it
were
better
that
the
old
civilization
were
stamped
into
the
mud
of
oblivion
than
that
prussian
kultur
should
be
swept
away
by
the
licentious
french
the
mercenary
english
british
murmured
white
and
the
yankees
but
i
making
a
fool
of
myself
with
an
effort
he
regained
his
calm
the
war
over
and
done
with
as
i
say
i
offered
my
government
my
secret
they
thought
it
good
but
could
not
help
me
they
were
afraid
that
the
league
would
come
to
learn
they
were
supporting
it
help
me
in
other
ways
innocent
ways
if
this
scheme
goes
through
they
will
put
the
full
resources
of
the
state
at
my
disposal
white
rose
groped
for
his
hat
and
cleared
his
throat
ah
van
heerden
you
may
be
sure
that
i
shall
ah
respect
your
confidence
with
your
very
natural
indignation
i
am
in
complete
sympathy
but
let
us
forget
ah
that
you
have
spoken
at
all
about
the
scheme
in
any
detail
especially
in
so
far
as
to
its
legality
or
otherwise
let
us
forget
sir
white
thrust
his
hand
into
the
bosom
of
his
coat
an
attitude
he
associated
with
the
subtle
rhetoric
of
statesmanship
let
us
forget
all
save
this
that
you
invite
me
to
subscribe
to
a
syndicate
for
ah
let
us
say
model
dwellings
for
the
working
classes
and
that
i
am
willing
to
subscribe
and
in
proof
of
my
willingness
will
send
you
by
the
night
post
a
cheque
for
that
amount
good
night
doctor
he
shook
hands
pulled
his
hat
down
upon
his
head
opened
the
door
and
ran
into
the
arms
of
a
man
whose
hand
was
at
that
moment
raised
to
press
the
electric
by
the
side
of
the
door
both
started
back
excuse
me
mumbled
white
and
hurried
down
the
stairs
van
heerden
glared
at
the
visitor
white
with
rage
come
in
you
fool
he
hissed
and
the
man
into
his
room
what
made
you
leave
scotland
scotland
i
hate
said
the
visitor
huskily
sticking
a
fellow
away
in
the
wilds
of
the
beastly
mountains
eh
that
not
playing
the
game
my
cheery
sportsman
when

the
most
absurd
position
for
a
man
of
my
parts
third
class
with
foul
and
common
people
i
like
to
rip
them
all
up
i
would
by
heavens
the
doctor
surveyed
the
coarse
face
the
loose
weak
mouth
at
the
vanity
of
the
dangling
monocle
and
pointed
to
the
decanter
you
did
wrong
to
come
he
said
i
have
arranged
your
passage
to
canada
next
week

said
the
man
tossing
down
a
drink
and
wiping
his
lips
with
a
not
handkerchief
curse
me
van
heerden
why
should
i
hide
and
fly
like
a
a
like
a
man
who
escaped
from
cayenne
suggested
the
doctor
or
like
a
man
who
is
wanted
by
the
police
of
three
countries
for
crimes
ranging
from
arson
to
wilful
murder
the
man
shuddered
all
fair
fights
my
dear
fellow
he
said
more
mildly
if
i
been
a
boastful
drunken
sot
you
would
have
heard
of
you
would
curse
you
i
was
mad
i
had
you
in
my
hand
like
that
he
closed
a
not
fist
under
van
heerden
nose
i
saw
it
all
all
i
saw
you
bullying
the
poor
devil
shaking
some
secret
out
of
him
i
saw
you
knife
him
hush
hissed
van
heerden
you
fool
people
can
hear
through
these
walls
but
there
are
no
windows
to
see
through
leered
the
man
and
i
he
came
out
of
his
to
denounce
you
by
jove
i
heard
him
shout
and
i
saw
you
run
in
and
lay
him
down
lay
him
down
lay
him
out
is
better
you
killed
him
to
shut
his
mouth
my
bonnie
doctor
van
heerden
face
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
but
the
hand
he
raised
to
his
lips
was
without
a
tremor
you
were
lucky
to
find
me
that
night
dear
lad
the
man
went
on
i
was
in
a
mind
to
split
on
you
you
have
no
cause
to
regret
my
finding
you

said
the
doctor
i
suppose

that
name

jackson
said
the
other
promptly

and
good
enough
for
anybody

and
done
me
well
i
wish

how
i
wish

van
heerden

life

in
eastbourne

you
to
london
whilst
the
police
were
searching
for
you
for
me
snarled
the
other
a
low
trick
by
the
everlasting
virtues
do
be
an
idiot
whose
word
would
they
have
taken
yours
or
mine
now
let
talk
on
thursday
next
you
sail
for
quebec
he
detailed
his
instructions
at
length
and
the
man
called
jackson
mellowed
by
repeated
visits
to
the
decanter
listened
and
even
approved
on
the
other
side
of
the
hallway
behind
the
closed
door
oliva
cresswell
her
covered
with
papers
and
books
was
working
hard
she
was
particularly
anxious
to
show
beale
a
sample
of
her
work
in
the
morning
and
was
making
a
fair
copy
of
what
she
had
described
to
him
that
afternoon
as
her
hotel
list
they
are
such
queer
names
she
said
there
is
one
called
scobbs
of
red
horse
valley
scobbs
he
had
laughed
strangely
enough
i
know
scobbs
who
is
quite
a
personage
in
that
part
of
the
world
he
owns
a
chain
of
hotels
in
western
canada
you
must
leave
him
out
even
had
she
wished
to
or
even
had
the
name
been
overlooked
once
she
could
not
have
escaped
it
for
jonas
scobbs
was
the
proprietor
of
scobbs
hotel
in
falling
star
city
of
the
bellevue
in
snakefence
of
the
palace
hotel
in
portage
after
awhile
it
began
to
lose
its
novelty
and
she
accepted
the
discovery
of
unsuspected
properties
of
scobbs
as
inevitable
she
filled
in
the
last
ruled
sheet
and
blotted
it
gathered
the
sheets
together
and
fastened
them
with
a
clip
she
yawned
as
she
rose
and
realized
that
her
previous
night
sleep
had
been
fitful
she
wondered
as
she
began
to
undress
if
she
would
dream
of
scobbs
or
no
she
did
want
to
dream
of
men
with
white
faces
and
the
thought
awoke
a
doubt
in
her
mind
had
she
bolted
the
door
of
the
flat
she
went
along
the
passage
in
her
stockinged
feet
shot
the
bolts
smoothly
and
was
aware
of
voices
outside
they
came
to
her
clearly
through
the
ventilator
above
the
fanlight
she
heard
the
doctor
say
something
and
then
a
voice
which
she
had
not
heard
before
do
worry
i
a
wonderful
memory
by
jove
the
murmur
of
the
doctor
did
not
reach
her
but
yes
yes
scobbs
hotel
red
horse
valley
know
the
place
well
good
night
dear
old
thing
a
door
banged
an
uncertain
footstep
died
away
in
the
well
of
the
stairs
below
and
she
was
left
to
recover
from
her
amazement
chapter
vii
plain
words
from
beale
oliva
cresswell
did
not
feel
at
all
sleepy
so
she
discovered
by
the
time
she
was
ready
for
bed
to
retire
in
that
condition
of
wakefulness
meant
another
sleepless
night
and
she
slipped
a
kimono
over
her
found
a
book
and
settled
into
the
big
under
the
light
for
the
reading
which
would
reduce
her
to
the
necessary
state
of
drowsiness
the
book
at
any
other
time
would
have
held
her
attention
but
now
she
found
her
thoughts
wandering
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
she
regarded
it
with
a
new
interest
was
the
young
man
who
had
so
strangely
intruded
himself
into
her
life
or
was
he
out
what
would
a
man
like
that
do
with
his
evenings
he
was
not
the
sort
of
person
who
could
find
any
pleasure
in
making
a
round
of
or
sitting
up
half
the
night
in
a
she
heard
a
dull
knock
and
it
came
from
the
wall
beale
was
at
home
then
he
had
pushed
a
chair
against
the
wall
or
he
was
knocking
in
nails
at
this
hour
of
the
night
thud
thud
thud
a
pause
thud
tap
thud
tap
the
dull
sound
was
as
if
made
by
a
fist
the
tap
by
a
it
was
repeated
suddenly
the
girl
jumped
up
with
a
little
laugh
he
was
signalling
to
her
and
had
sent
her
initials
she
tapped
three
times
with
her
finger
struck
once
with
the
flat
of
her
hand
and
tapped
again
she
had
sent
the
understood
message
presently
he
began
and
she
jotted
the
message
on
the
margin
of
her
book
most
urgent
do
use
soap
bring
it
to
office
she
smiled
faintly
she
expected
something
more
brilliant
in
the
way
of
humour
even
from
beale
she
tapped
acknowledged
and
went
to
bed
matilda
my
innocent
child
she
said
to
herself
as
she
snuggled
up
under
the
exchanging
midnight
signals
with
a
lodger
is
neither
proper
nor
she
had
agreed
with
herself
that
in
spite
of
the
latitude
she
was
allowed
in
the
matter
of
office
hours
that
she
would
put
in
an
appearance
punctually
at
ten
this
meant
rising
not
later
than
eight
for
she
had
her
little
household
to
put
in
order
before
she
left
it
was
the
postman
insistent
knocking
at
that
woke
her
from
a
dreamless
sleep
and
she
dragged
herself
into
her
and
went
to
the
door
parcel
miss
said
the
invisible
official
and
put
into
the
hand
that
came
round
the
edge
of
the
door
a
letter
and
a
small
package
she
brought
them
to
the
and
pulled
back
the
curtains
the
letter
was
and
was
on
the
of
a
firm
of
perfumers
it
was
addressed
to
miss
olivia
cresswell
and
ran
dear
madame
we
have
pleasure
in
sending
you
for
your
use
a
sample
cake
of
our
new
complexion
soap
which
we
trust
will
meet
with
your
approval
but
how
nice
she
said
and
wondered
why
she
had
been
singled
out
for
the
favour
she
opened
the
package
in
a
small
carton
carefully
wrapped
in
the
thinnest
of
paper
was
an
oval
tablet
of
soap
that
exhaled
a
delicate
fragrance
but
how
nice
she
said
again
and
put
the
gift
in
the
this
was
starting
the
day
well
a
small
enough
foundation
for
happiness
yet
one
which
every
woman
knows
for
happiness
is
made
up
of
small
and
acceptable
things
and
given
the
psychological
moment
a
bunch
of
primroses
has
a
greater
value
than
a
rope
of
pearls
in
her
bath
she
picked
up
the
soap
and
dropped
it
back
in
the
tidy
again
quickly
do
use
soap
bring
it
to
office
she
remembered
the
message
in
a
flash
beale
had
known
that
this
parcel
was
coming
then
and
his
most
urgent
warning
was
not
a
joke
she
dressed
quickly
made
a
poor
breakfast
and
was
at
the
office
ten
minutes
before
the
hour
she
found
her
employer
waiting
sitting
in
his
accustomed
place
on
the
edge
of
the
table
in
her
office
he
gave
her
a
little
nod
of
welcome
and
without
a
word
stretched
out
his
hand
the
soap
she
asked
he
nodded
she
opened
her
bag
good
he
said
i
see
you
have
kept
the
wrappings
and
that
i
presume
is
the
letter
which
accompanied
the
what
shall
i
say
gift
do
touch
it
with
your
bare
hand
he
said
quickly
handle
it
with
the
paper
he
pulled
his
gloves
from
his
pocket
and
slipped
them
on
then
took
the
cake
of
soap
in
his
hand
and
carried
it
to
the
light
smelt
it
and
returned
it
to
its
paper
now
let
me
see
the
letter
she
handed
it
to
him
and
he
read
it
from
brandan
the
perfumers
they
would
be
in
it
but
we
had
better
make
sure
he
walked
to
the
telephone
and
gave
a
number
and
the
girl
heard
him
speaking
in
a
low
tone
to
somebody
at
the
other
end
presently
he
put
down
the
receiver
and
walked
back
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
they
know
nothing
about
this
act
of
generosity
he
said
by
this
time
she
had
removed
her
coat
and
hat
and
hung
them
up
and
had
taken
her
place
at
her
desk
she
sat
with
her
elbows
on
the
her
chin
on
her
clasped
hands
looking
up
at
him
i
do
think
it
fair
that
things
should
be
kept
from
me
any
longer
she
said
many
mysterious
things
have
happened
in
the
past
few
days
and
since
they
have
all
directly
affected
me
i
think
i
am
entitled
to
some
sort
of
explanation
i
think
you
are
said
beale
with
a
twinkle
in
his
grey
eyes
but
i
am
not
prepared
to
explain
everything
just
yet
thus
much
i
will
tell
you
that
had
you
used
this
soap
this
morning
by
the
evening
you
would
have
been
covered
from
head
to
foot
in
a
rather
alarming
and
irritating
rash
she
gasped
but
who
dared
to
send
me
this
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
who
knows
but
first
let
me
ask
you
this
miss
cresswell
suppose
when
you
had
looked
at
yourself
in
the
glass
you
had
discovered
your
face
was
covered
with
red
blotches
and
on
further
examination
you
found
your
arms
and
indeed
the
whole
of
your
body
similarly
disfigured
what
would
you
have
done
she
thought
for
a
moment
why
of
course
i
should
have
sent
for
the
doctor
which
doctor
he
asked
carelessly
doctor
van
heerden
oh
she
looked
at
him
resentfully
you
suggest
that
doctor
van
heerden
sent
that
hideous
thing
to
me
i
do
suggest
anything
said
beale
coolly
i
merely
say
that
you
would
have
sent
for
a
doctor
and
that
that
doctor
would
have
been
doctor
van
heerden
i
say
further
that
he
would
have
come
to
you
and
been
very
sympathetic
and
would
have
ordered
you
to
remain
in
bed
for
four
or
five
days
i
think
too
he
said
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
and
speaking
slowly
as
though
he
were
working
out
the
possible
consequence
in
his
mind
that
he
would
have
given
you
some
very
palatable
medicine
what
are
you
insinuating
she
asked
quietly
he
did
not
reply
immediately
if
you
will
get
out
of
your
mind
the
idea
that
i
have
any
particular
grievance
against
doctor
van
heerden
that
i
regard
him
as
a
rival
a
business
rival
let
us
say
or
that
i
have
some
secret
grudge
against
him
and
if
in
place
of
that
suspicion
you
would
believe
that
i
am
serving
a
much
larger
interest
than
is
apparent
to
you
i
think
we
might
discuss
he
smiled
even
doctor
van
heerden
without
such
a
discussion
giving
offence
to
you
she
laughed
i
am
really
not
offended
i
am
rather
distressed
if
anything
she
said
knitting
her
brows
you
see
doctor
van
heerden
has
always
been
most
kind
to
me
beale
nodded
he
got
you
your
rooms
at
the
flats
he
replied
quietly
he
was
also
ready
to
give
you
employment
the
moment
you
were
providentially
discharged
from
punsonby
does
it
not
strike
you
miss
cresswell
that
every
kind
act
of
doctor
van
heerden
has
had
a
tendency
to
bring
you
together
into
closer
association
i
mean
does
it
not
appear
to
you
that
the
net
result
of
all
the
things
that
might
have
happened
to
you
in
the
past
few
days
would
have
been
to
make
you
more
and
more
dependent
upon
doctor
van
heerden
for
example
if
you
had
gone
into
his
employ
as
he
planned
that
you
should
planned
she
gasped
his
face
was
grave
now
and
the
laughter
had
gone
out
of
his
eyes
planned
he
said
quietly
you
were
discharged
from
punsonby
at
doctor
van
heerden
instigation
i
will
not
believe
it
that
will
not
make
it
any
less
the
fact
said
beale
you
were
nearly
arrested
again
at
doctor
van
heerden
instigation
he
was
waiting
for
you
when
you
came
back
from
punsonby
ready
to
offer
you
his
job
when
he
discovered
you
had
already
engaged
yourself
he
telephoned
to
white
instructing
him
to
have
you
arrested
so
that
you
might
be
disgraced
and
might
turn
to
him
your
one
loyal
friend
she
listened
speechless
she
could
only
stare
at
him
and
could
not
even
interrupt
him
for
her
shrewd
woman
instinct
told
her
so
convincingly
that
even
her
sense
of
loyalty
could
not
eject
the
doubt
which
assailed
her
mind
that
if
there
was
not
truth
in
what
he
was
saying
there
was
at
least
probability
i
suggest
even
more
beale
went
on
i
suggest
that
for
some
purpose
doctor
van
heerden
desires
to
secure
a
mental
physical
and
moral
ascendancy
over
you
in
other
words
he
wishes
to
enslave
you
to
his
will
she
looked
at
him
in
wonder
and
burst
into
a
peal
of
ringing
laughter
really
beale
you
are
too
absurd
she
said
are
i
he
smiled
it
sounds
like
something
out
of
a
melodrama
why
on
earth
should
he
want
to
secure
a
mental
ascendancy
over
me
do
you
suggest
she
flushed
i
suggest
nothing
any
longer
said
beale
slipping
off
from
the
end
of
the
table
i
merely
make
a
statement
of
fact
i
do
not
think
he
has
any
designs
on
you
within
the
conventional
meaning
of
that
phrase
indeed
i
think
he
wants
to
marry
you
what
do
you
think
about
that
she
had
recovered
something
of
her
poise
and
her
sense
of
humour
was
helping
her
out
of
a
situation
which
without
such
a
gift
might
have
been
an
embarrassing
one
i
think
you
have
been
seeing
too
many
plays
and
reading
too
many
exciting
books
beale
she
said
i
confess
i
have
never
regarded
doctor
van
heerden
as
a
possible
suitor
and
if
i
thought
he
was
i
should
be
immensely
flattered
but
may
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
are
other
ways
of
winning
a
girl
than
by
giving
her
they
laughed
together
all
right
he
said
swinging
up
his
hat
proceed
with
the
good
work
and
seek
out
the
various
domiciles
of
mr
scobbs
then
she
remembered
do
you
know
he
was
at
the
door
when
she
spoke
and
he
stopped
and
turned
the
name
of
scobbs
gives
me
a
cold
shiver
why
answer
me
this
she
said
why
should
i
who
have
never
heard
of
him
before
until
yesterday
hear
his
name
mentioned
by
a
perfect
stranger
the
smile
died
away
from
his
face
who
mentioned
him
no
it
is
idle
curiosity
he
said
in
face
of
her
derisive
finger
i
am
really
serious
who
mentioned
his
name
a
visitor
of
doctor
van
heerden
i
heard
them
talking
through
the
ventilator
when
i
was
bolting
my
door
a
visitor
to
doctor
van
heerden
and
he
mentioned
scobbs
of
red
horse
valley
he
said
half
to
himself
you
did
see
the
man
no
you
just
heard
him
no
names
were
mentioned
none
she
said
is
it
a
frightfully
important
matter
it
is
rather
he
replied
we
have
got
to
get
busy
and
with
this
cryptic
remark
he
left
her
the
day
passed
as
quickly
as
its
predecessor
the
tabulation
at
which
she
was
working
grew
until
by
the
evening
there
was
a
pile
of
sheets
in
the
cupboard
covered
with
her
fine
writing
she
might
have
done
more
but
for
the
search
she
had
to
make
for
a
missing
report
to
verify
one
of
her
facts
it
was
not
on
the
shelf
and
she
was
about
to
abandon
her
search
and
postpone
the
confirmation
till
she
saw
beale
when
she
noticed
a
cupboard
beneath
the
shelves
it
was
unlocked
and
she
opened
it
and
found
as
she
had
expected
that
it
was
full
of
books
amongst
which
was
the
missing
documentation
she
sought
with
a
view
to
future
contingencies
she
examined
the
contents
of
the
cupboard
and
was
arrested
by
a
thin
volume
which
bore
no
inscription
or
title
on
its
blank
cover
she
opened
it
and
on
the
title
page
read
the
millinborn
murder
the
author
name
was
not
given
and
the
contents
were
made
up
of
very
careful
analysis
of
evidence
given
by
the
various
witnesses
at
the
inquest
and
plans
and
diagrams
with
little
red
crosses
to
show
where
every
actor
in
that
tragedy
had
been
she
read
the
first
page
idly
and
turned
it
she
was
down
the
second
page
when
she
uttered
a
little
exclamation
for
a
familiar
name
was
there
the
name
of
van
heerden
fascinated
she
read
the
story
to
the
end
that
the
name
of
beale
would
occur
there
were
many
names
all
unknown
to
her
and
one
that
occurred
with
the
greatest
frequency
was
that
of
james
kitson
beale
did
not
appear
to
have
played
any
part
she
read
for
an
hour
sitting
on
the
floor
by
the
cupboard
she
reached
the
last
page
closed
the
book
and
slipped
it
back
in
the
cupboard
she
wondered
why
beale
had
preserved
this
record
and
whether
his
antagonism
to
the
doctor
was
founded
on
that
case
at
first
she
thought
she
identified
him
with
the
mysterious
man
who
had
appeared
in
the
plantation
before
the
murder
but
a
glance
back
at
the
description
of
the
stranger
dispelled
that
idea
for
all
the
reputation
he
had
beale
did
not
have
an
inflamed
swollen
countenance
colourless
bloodshot
eyes
nor
was
he
bald
she
was
annoyed
with
herself
that
she
had
allowed
her
work
to
be
interrupted
and
in
penance
decided
to
remain
on
until
six
instead
of
five
as
she
had
intended
besides
she
half
expected
that
beale
would
return
and
was
surprised
to
discover
that
she
was
disappointed
that
he
had
not
at
six
she
dismissed
the
boy
closed
and
locked
the
office
and
made
her
way
downstairs
into
the
crowded
street
to
her
surprise
she
heard
her
name
spoken
and
turned
to
face
van
heerden
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
for
nearly
an
hour
he
said
with
reproach
and
your
patients
are
probably
dying
like
flies
she
countered
it
was
in
her
mind
to
make
some
excuse
and
go
home
alone
but
curiosity
got
the
better
of
her
and
impelled
her
to
wait
to
discover
the
object
of
this
unexpected
visitation
how
did
you
know
where
i
was
working
she
asked
as
the
thought
occurred
to
her
he
laughed
it
was
a
very
simple
matter
i
was
on
my
way
to
a
patient
and
i
saw
you
coming
out
to
lunch
he
said
and
as
i
found
myself
in
the
neighbourhood
an
hour
ago
i
thought
i
would
wait
and
take
you
home
you
are
doing
a
very
foolish
thing
he
added
what
do
you
mean
in
stopping
to
talk
to
you
when
i
ought
to
be
on
my
way
home
to
tea
no
in
engaging
yourself
to
a
man
like
beale
you
know
the
reputation
he
has
my
dear
girl
i
was
shocked
when
i
discovered
who
your
employer
was
i
do
think
you
need
distress
yourself
on
my
account
doctor
she
said
quietly
really
beale
is
quite
pleasant
in
his
lucid
moments
she
smiled
to
herself
she
was
not
being
disloyal
to
her
employer
if
he
chose
to
encourage
suspicion
in
his
mode
of
life
he
must
abide
by
the
consequences
but
a
drunkard
faugh
the
exquisite
doctor
shivered
i
have
always
tried
to
be
a
friend
of
yours
miss
cresswell
and
i
hope
you
are
going
to
let
me
continue
to
be
and
my
advice
to
you
in
that
capacity
is
give
beale
notice
how
absurd
you
are
she
laughed
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
i
should
do
anything
of
the
sort
beale
has
treated
me
with
the
greatest
consideration
what
is
he
by
the
way
asked
the
doctor
he
an
agent
of
some
sort
said
the
girl
but
i
am
sure
you
want
me
to
discuss
his
business
and
now
i
must
go
doctor
if
you
will
excuse
me
one
moment
he
begged
i
have
a
cab
here
wo
you
come
and
have
tea
somewhere
where
is
somewhere
she
asked
the
grand
alliance
he
suggested
she
nodded
slowly

the
crime
of
the
grand
alliance
the
hotel
and
the
café
of
the
grand
alliance
was
london
newest
rendezvous
its
great
was
crowded
at
the
and
if
as
the
mysterious
beale
had
hinted
any
danger
was
to
be
apprehended
from
van
heerden
it
could
not
come
to
her
in
that
most
open
of
public
places
she
had
no
fear
but
that
eighth
sense
of
armed
caution
which
is
the
possession
of
every
girl
who
has
to
work
for
her
living
and
is
conscious
of
the
perils
which
await
her
on
every
side
reviewed
with
lightning
speed
all
the
possibilities
and
gave
her
the
passport
of
approval
it
was
later
than
she
had
thought
only
a
few
tables
were
occupied
but
he
had
evidently
reserved
one
for
immediately
on
his
appearance
the
waiter
with
a
smirk
led
him
to
one
of
the
alcoves
and
pulled
back
a
chair
for
the
girl
she
looked
round
as
she
stripped
her
gloves
the
place
was
not
unfamiliar
to
her
it
was
here
she
came
at
rare
intervals
when
her
finances
admitted
of
such
an
hilarious
recreation
to
find
comfort
for
jangled
nerves
to
sit
and
sip
her
tea
to
the
sound
of
violins
and
watch
the
happy
crowd
at
her
leisure
absorbing
something
of
the
happiness
they
diffused
the
was
a
spacious
marble
hall
a
big
circle
of
polished
pillars
supporting
the
dome
through
the
tinted
glass
of
which
the
light
was
filtered
in
soft
hues
upon
the
marble
floor
below
doctor
she
said
suddenly
remembering
i
have
been
reading
quite
a
lot
about
you
he
raised
his
eyebrows
about
me
she
nodded
smiling
mischievously
i
did
know
that
you
were
such
a
famous
person
i
have
been
reading
about
the
millinborn
murder
you
have
been
reading
about
the
millinborn
murder
he
said
steadily
looking
into
her
eyes
an
unpleasant
case
and
one
i
should
like
to
forget
i
thought
it
was
awfully
thrilling
she
said
it
read
like
a
detective
story
without
a
satisfactory
end
he
laughed
what
a
perfectly
gruesome
subject
for
talk
he
said
lightly
and
beckoned
the
you
are
keeping
us
waiting
jaques
doctor
it
will
be
but
a
few
minutes
pleaded
the
waiter
and
then
in
a
low
voice
which
was
not
so
low
that
it
did
not
reach
the
girl
we
have
had
some
trouble
this
afternoon
doctor
with
your
friend
my
friend
the
doctor
looked
up
sharply
whom
do
you
mean
with
mr
jackson
jackson
said
the
doctor
startled
i
thought
he
had
left
he
was
to
leave
this
morning
by
the
ten
train
but
he
had
a
we
recovered
him
with
brandy
and
he
was
too
well
for
this
afternoon
he
faint
again
where
is
he
now
asked
van
heerden
after
a
pause
in
his
room
monsieur
he
leave
for
ireland
this
he
tell
me
to
catch
the
mail
steamer
at
queenstown
do
let
him
know
i
am
here
said
the
doctor
he
turned
to
the
girl
with
a
shrug
a
dissolute
friend
of
mine
whom
i
am
sending
out
to
the
colonies
he
said
wo
you
go
and
see
him
she
asked
he
must
be
very
ill
if
he
faints
i
think
not
said
van
heerden
quietly
these
little
attacks
are
not
serious
he
had
one
in
my
room
the
other
night
it
is
a
result
of
and
six
months
in
canada
will
make
a
man
of
him
she
did
not
reply
with
difficulty
she
restrained
an
exclamation
so
that
was
the
man
who
had
been
in
the
doctor
room
and
who
was
going
to
red
horse
valley
she
would
have
dearly
loved
to
supplement
her
information
about
scobbs
proprietor
of
many
hotels
and
to
have
mystified
him
with
her
knowledge
of
western
canada
but
she
refrained
instead
she
took
up
the
conversation
where
he
had
tried
to
break
it
off
do
you
know
mr
kitson
kitson
oh
yes
you
mean
the
lawyer
man
he
replied
reluctantly
i
know
him
but
i
am
afraid
i
do
know
much
that
is
good
about
him
now
i
going
to
tell
you
miss
cresswell
he
leant
across
the
table
and
spoke
in
a
lower
tone
something
that
i
have
never
told
to
a
human
being
you
raised
the
question
of
the
millinborn
murder
my
view
is
that
kitson
the
lawyer
knew
much
more
about
that
murder
than
any
man
in
this
world
if
there
is
anybody
who
knows
more
it
is
beale
mr
beale
she
said
incredulously
beale
he
repeated
you
know
the
story
of
the
murder
you
say
you
have
read
it
millinborn
was
dying
and
i
had
left
the
room
with
kitson
when
somebody
entered
the
window
and
stabbed
john
millinborn
to
the
heart
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
that
murder
was
witnessed
by
this
very
man
i
am
sending
to
canada
he
persists
in
denying
that
he
saw
anything
but
later
he
may
change
his
tune
a
light
dawned
upon
her
then
jackson
is
the
man
who
was
seen
by
kitson
in
the
plantation
exactly
said
the
doctor
but
i
do
understand
she
said
perplexed
are
the
police
searching
for
jackson
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
in
the
interests
of
justice
that
they
should
find
him
he
said
gravely
i
place
the
utmost
reliance
on
him
i
am
sending
jackson
to
a
farm
in
ontario
kept
by
a
medical
friend
of
mine
who
has
made
a
hobby
of
dealing
with
dipsomaniacs
he
met
her
eyes
unfalteringly
van
heerden
she
said
slowly
you
are
sending
jackson
to
red
horse
valley
he
started
back
as
if
he
had
been
struck
in
the
face
and
for
a
moment
was
inarticulate
what
what
do
you
know
he
asked
incoherently
his
face
had
grown
white
his
eyes
tragic
with
fear
she
was
alarmed
at
the
effect
of
her
words
and
hastened
to
remove
the
impression
she
had
created
i
only
know
that
i
heard
jackson
through
the
ventilator
of
my
flat
saying
to
you
the
other
night
he
mentioned
red
horse
valley
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
was
master
of
himself
again
but
his
face
was
still
pale
oh
that
he
said
that
is
a
polite
fiction
jackson
knows
of
this
inebriates
home
in
ontario
and
i
had
to
provide
him
with
a
destination
he
will
go
no
farther
than
why
curse
my
life
if
it
is
the
doctor
at
the
sound
of
the
raucous
voice
both
looked
up
the
man
called
jackson
had
hailed
them
from
the
centre
of
the
hall
he
was
well
dressed
but
no
tailor
could
compensate
for
the
repulsiveness
of
that
puckered
and
swollen
face
those
malignant
eyes
which
peered
out
into
the
world
through
two
slits
he
was
wearing
his
suit
his
new
hat
was
in
his
hand
and
the
dome
of
his
head
glistened
baldly
i
cursed
if
this
is
amiable
of
you
doctor
he
did
not
look
at
the
girl
but
grinned
complacently
upon
her
angry
companion
here
i
am
he
threw
out
his
arms
with
an
extravagant
gesture
leaving
the
country
of
my
adoption
if
not
birth
without
one
solitary
soul
to
see
me
off
or
take
farewell
of
me
i
who
have
been
well
you
know
what
i
been
van
heerden
the
world
has
treated
me
very
badly
by
heaven
i
like
to
come
back
a
billionaire
and
ruin
all
of
i
like
to
cut
their
throats
and
amputate
limb
from
limb
i
would
like
be
silent
said
van
heerden
angrily
have
you
no
decency
do
you
not
realize
i
am
with
a
lady
pardon
the
man
called
jackson
leapt
up
from
the
chair
into
which
he
had
fallen
and
bowed
extravagantly
in
the
direction
of
the
girl
i
can
not
see
your
face
because
of
your
hat
my
dear
lady
he
said
gallantly
but
i
am
sure
my
friend
van
heerden
whose
taste
will
you
be
quiet
said
van
heerden
go
to
your
room
and
i
will
come
up
to
you
go
to
my
room
scoffed
the
other
by
jove
i
like
that
that
any
of
a
sawbones
should
tell
me
to
go
to
my
room
after
what
i
have
been
after
the
position
i
have
held
in
society
i
have
had
ambassadors
carriages
at
my
door
my
dear
fellow
princes
of
the
royal
blood
and
to
be
told
to
go
to
my
room
like
a
naughty
little
boy
too
much
then
behave
yourself
said
van
heerden
and
at
least
wait
until
i
am
free
before
you
approach
me
again
but
the
man
showed
no
inclination
to
move
rather
did
this
rebuff
stimulate
his
power
of
reminiscence
ignore
me
miss
i
have
not
your
name
but
i
am
sure
it
is
a
noble
one
he
said
you
see
before
you
one
who
in
his
time
has
been
a
squire
of
dames
by
jove
i
ca
remember
they
must
number
thousands
and
only
one
of
them
was
worth
two
sous
yes
he
shook
his
head
in
melancholy
only
one
of
by
jove
the
rest
were
he
snapped
his
fingers
that
for
the
girl
listened
against
her
will
jackson
and
van
heerden
voice
trembled
with
passion
will
you
go
or
must
i
force
you
to
go
jackson
rose
with
a
loud
laugh
evidently
i
am
he
said
with
heavy
sarcasm
he
held
out
a
swollen
hand
which
van
heerden
ignored
farewell
mademoiselle
he
thrust
the
hand
forward
so
that
she
could
not
miss
it
she
took
it
a
cold
flabby
thing
which
sent
a
shudder
of
loathing
through
her
frame
and
raised
her
face
to
his
for
the
first
time
he
let
the
hand
drop
he
was
staring
at
her
with
open
mouth
and
features
distorted
with
horror
you
he
croaked
she
shrunk
back
against
the
wall
of
the
alcove
but
he
made
no
movement
she
sensed
the
terror
and
agony
in
his
voice
you
he
gasped
mary
hang
you
go
roared
van
heerden
and
thrust
him
back
but
though
he
staggered
back
a
pace
under
the
weight
of
the
other
arm
his
eyes
did
not
leave
the
girl
face
and
she
fascinated
by
the
appeal
in
the
face
of
the
wreck
could
not
turn
hers
away
mary
he
whispered
what
is
your
other
name
with
an
effort
the
girl
recovered
herself
my
name
is
not
mary
she
said
quietly
my
name
is
oliva
cresswell
oliva
cresswell
he
repeated
oliva
cresswell
he
made
a
movement
toward
her
but
van
heerden
barred
his
way
she
heard
jackson
say
something
in
a
strangled
voice
and
heard
van
heerden
sharp
what
and
there
was
a
fierce
exchange
of
words
the
attention
of
the
few
people
in
the
had
been
attracted
to
the
unusual
spectacle
of
two
men
engaged
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
struggle
sit
down
sit
down
you
fool
sit
over
there
i
will
come
to
you
in
a
minute
can
you
swear
what
you
say
is
true
jackson
nodded
he
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
my
name
is
prédeaux
he
said
that
is
my
daughter
i
married
in
the
name
of
cresswell
my
daughter
he
repeated
how
wonderful
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
van
heerden
he
had
the
other
to
a
chair
near
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
rotunda
i
am
going
to
tell
her
said
the
wreck
what
are
you
doing
with
her
he
demanded
fiercely
that
is
no
business
of
yours
replied
van
heerden
sharply
no
business
of
mine
eh
i
show
you
it
some
business
of
mine
i
am
going
to
tell
her
all
i
know
about
you
i
have
been
a
rotter
and
worse
than
a
rotter
the
old
flippancy
had
gone
and
the
harsh
voice
was
vibrant
with
purpose
my
path
has
been
littered
with
the
wrecks
of
human
lives
he
said
bitterly
and
they
are
mostly
women
i
broke
the
heart
of
the
best
woman
in
the
world
and
i
am
going
to
see
that
you
do
break
the
heart
of
her
daughter
will
you
be
quiet
hissed
van
heerden
i
will
go
and
get
her
away
and
then
i
will
come
back
to
you
jackson
did
not
reply
he
sat
huddled
up
in
his
chair
muttering
to
himself
and
van
heerden
walked
quickly
back
to
the
girl
i
am
afraid
i
shall
have
to
let
you
go
back
by
yourself
he
is
having
one
of
his
fits
i
think
it
is
delirium
tremens
do
you
think
you
had
better
send
for
she
began
she
was
going
to
say
send
for
a
doctor
and
the
absurdity
of
the
request
struck
her
i
think
you
had
better
go
he
said
hastily
with
a
glance
at
the
man
who
was
struggling
to
his
feet
i
ca
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
that
we
had
this
scene
stop
it
was
jackson
voice
he
stood
swaying
between
the
chair
he
had
left
and
the
alcove
and
his
trembling
finger
was
pointing
at
them
stop
he
said
in
a
commanding
voice
stop
i
got
something
to
say
to
you
i
know
he
making
you
pay
for
the
green
rust
so
far
he
got
when
he
reeled
and
collapsed
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
the
doctor
sprang
forward
lifted
him
and
carried
him
to
the
chair
by
the
pillar
he
picked
up
the
overcoat
that
the
man
had
been
wearing
and
spread
it
over
him
it
a
nothing
to
be
alarmed
about
he
said
to
the
little
knot
of
people
from
the
tables
who
had
gathered
about
the
limp
figure
jaques
he
called
the
get
some
brandy
he
must
be
kept
warm
shall
i
ring
for
an
ambulance
it
is
not
necessary
said
van
heerden
he
will
recover
in
a
few
moments
just
leave
him
and
he
walked
back
to
the
alcove
who
is
he
asked
the
girl
and
her
voice
was
shaking
in
spite
of
herself
he
is
a
man
i
knew
in
his
better
days
said
van
heerden
and
now
i
think
you
must
go
i
would
rather
wait
to
see
if
he
recovers
she
said
with
some
obstinacy
i
want
you
to
go
he
said
earnestly
you
would
please
me
very
much
if
you
would
do
as
i
ask
there
the
waiter
she
interrupted
he
has
the
brandy
wo
you
give
it
to
him
it
was
the
doctor
who
in
the
presence
of
the
assembled
visitors
dissolved
a
white
pellet
in
the
brandy
before
he
forced
the
clenched
teeth
apart
and
poured
the
liquor
to
the
last
drop
down
the
throat
jackson
or
prédeaux
to
give
him
his
real
name
shuddered
as
he
drank
shuddered
again
a
few
seconds
later
and
then
went
suddenly
limp
the
doctor
bent
down
and
lifted
his
eyelid
i
am
afraid
he
is
dead
he
said
in
a
low
voice
dead
the
girl
stared
at
him
oh
no
not
dead
van
heerden
nodded
heart
failure
he
said
the
same
kind
of
heart
failure
that
killed
john
millinborn
said
a
voice
behind
him
the
cost
of
the
green
rust
is
totalling
up
doctor
the
girl
swung
round
beale
was
standing
at
her
elbow
but
his
steady
eyes
were
fixed
upon
van
heerden
chapter
ix
a
crime
against
the
world
what
do
you
mean
asked
van
heerden
i
merely
repeat
the
words
of
the
dead
man
answered
beale
heart
failure
he
picked
up
from
the
table
the
leather
case
which
the
doctor
had
taken
from
his
pocket
there
were
four
little
phials
and
one
of
these
was
uncorked
digitalis
he
read
that
should
kill
him
doctor
he
looked
at
van
heerden
thoughtfully
then
picked
up
the
phial
again
it
bore
the
label
of
a
firm
of
wholesale
chemists
and
the
seal
had
apparently
been
broken
for
the
first
time
when
van
heerden
opened
the
tiny
bottle
you
have
sent
for
the
police
beale
asked
the
agitated
manager
oui
directly
they
come
now
i
think
he
walked
to
the
vestibule
to
meet
three
men
in
plain
clothes
who
had
just
come
through
the
there
was
something
about
van
heerden
attitude
which
struck
beale
as
strange
he
was
standing
in
the
exact
spot
he
had
stood
when
the
detective
had
addressed
him
it
seemed
as
if
something
rooted
him
to
the
spot
he
did
not
move
even
when
the
ambulance
men
were
lifting
the
body
nor
when
the
police
were
taking
particulars
of
the
circumstances
of
the
death
and
beale
escorting
the
shaken
girl
up
the
broad
staircase
to
a
room
where
she
could
rest
and
recover
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
him
still
standing
his
head
bent
his
fingers
smoothing
his
beard
it
was
dreadful
dreadful
said
the
girl
with
a
shiver
i
have
never
seen
anybody
die
it
was
awful
beale
nodded
his
thoughts
were
set
on
the
doctor
why
had
he
stood
so
motionless
he
was
not
the
kind
of
man
to
be
shocked
by
so
normal
a
phenomenon
as
death
he
was
a
doctor
and
such
sights
were
common
to
him
what
was
the
reason
for
this
strange
paralysis
which
kept
him
chained
to
the
spot
even
after
the
body
had
been
removed
the
girl
was
talking
but
he
did
not
hear
her
he
knew
instinctively
that
in
van
heerden
curious
attitude
was
a
solution
of
death
excuse
me
a
moment
he
said
he
passed
with
rapid
strides
from
the
room
down
the
broad
stairway
and
into
the
van
heerden
had
gone
the
explanation
flashed
upon
him
and
he
hurried
to
the
spot
where
the
doctor
had
stood
on
the
tessellated
floor
was
a
little
patch
no
bigger
than
a
saucer
which
had
been
recently
washed
he
beckoned
the
manager
who
has
been
cleaning
this
tile
he
asked
the
manager
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
was
the
doctor
sare
so
eccentric
he
call
for
a
glass
of
water
and
he
dip
his
handkerchief
in
and
then
lift
up
his
foot
and
with
rapidity
incredible
he
wash
the
floor
with
his
handkerchief
fool
snapped
beale
oh
hopeless
fool
sare
said
the
startled
manager
it
all
right
barri
smiled
beale
ruefully
i
was
addressing
myself
oh
what
a
fool
i
been
he
went
down
on
his
knees
and
examined
the
floor
i
want
this
tile
do
let
anybody
touch
it
he
said
of
course
van
heerden
had
stood
because
under
his
foot
he
had
crushed
the
digitalis
tablet
he
had
taken
from
the
phial
and
for
which
he
had
substituted
something
more
deadly
had
he
moved
the
powdered
tablet
would
have
been
seen
it
was
simple
horribly
simple
he
walked
slowly
back
to
where
he
had
left
oliva
what
followed
seemed
ever
after
like
a
bad
dream
to
the
girl
she
was
stunned
by
the
tragedy
which
had
happened
under
her
eyes
and
could
offer
no
evidence
which
in
any
way
assisted
the
police
in
their
subsequent
investigation
the
sum
of
which
was
ably
set
forth
in
the
columns
of
the
the
tragedy
which
occurred
in
the
of
the
grand
alliance
hotel
yesterday
must
be
added
to
the
already
long
list
of
unravelled
mysteries
the
deceased
a
man
named
jackson
has
been
staying
at
the
hotel
for
a
week
and
was
on
the
point
of
departure
for
canada
at
the
last
moment
van
heerden
who
was
assisting
the
unfortunate
man
discovered
that
jackson
was
no
other
than
the
wanted
man
in
the
millinborn
murder
a
crime
which
most
of
our
readers
will
recall
van
heerden
stated
to
our
representative
that
the
man
had
represented
that
he
was
a
friend
of
the
late
john
millinborn
but
was
anxious
to
get
to
canada
he
had
produced
excellent
credentials
and
van
heerden
in
a
spirit
of
generosity
offered
to
assist
him
at
the
eleventh
hour
however
he
was
struck
with
the
likeness
the
man
bore
to
the
published
description
of
the
missing
man
in
the
millinborn
case
and
was
on
the
point
of
telegraphing
to
the
authorities
at
liverpool
when
he
discovered
that
jackson
had
missed
the
train
the
present
tragedy
points
to
suicide
the
man
it
will
be
remembered
collapsed
and
van
heerden
rendered
first
aid
administering
to
the
man
a
perfectly
harmless
drug
the
examination
reveals
the
presence
in
the
body
of
a
considerable
quantity
of
cyanide
of
potassium
and
the
police
theory
is
that
this
was
before
the
collapse
in
the
man
pocket
was
discovered
a
number
of
cyanide
tablets
am
satisfied
said
van
heerden
the
man
already
contemplated
the
deed
and
when
i
voiced
my
suspicions
in
the
he
decided
upon
the
action
the
presence
in
his
pocket
of
cyanide
one
of
the
deadliest
and
quickest
of
poisons
suggests
that
he
had
the
project
in
his
mind
i
did
not
see
his
action
or
of
course
i
should
have
stopped
him
oliva
cresswell
read
this
account
in
her
room
two
nights
following
the
tragedy
and
was
struck
by
certain
curious
inaccuracies
if
all
that
the
doctor
had
told
her
was
true
beale
read
the
account
smiled
across
the
table
grimly
to
the
bearded
superintendent
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
how
does
that
strike
you
for
ingenuity
he
said
pushing
the
paper
over
the
table
i
have
read
it
said
the
other
laconically
i
think
we
have
sufficient
evidence
to
arrest
van
heerden
the
tile
from
the
grand
alliance
shows
traces
of
digitalis
beale
shook
his
head
the
case
would
fall
he
said
what
evidence
have
you
we
did
not
confiscate
his
he
might
have
dropped
a
tablet
of
digitalis
by
accident
the
only
evidence
you
could
convict
van
heerden
on
is
proof
that
he
brought
with
him
cyanide
tablets
which
he
slipped
into
prédeaux
pocket
no
we
can
prove
nothing
what
is
your
theory
in
connection
with
the
crime
i
have
many
theories
said
beale
rising
and
pacing
the
room
and
one
certainty
i
am
satisfied
that
millinborn
was
killed
by
doctor
van
heerden
he
was
killed
because
during
the
absence
of
kitson
in
the
village
the
doctor
forced
from
the
dying
man
a
secret
which
up
till
then
he
had
jealously
preserved
when
kitson
returned
he
found
his
friend
as
he
thought
and
van
heerden
also
thought
that
john
millinborn
would
not
speak
again
to
his
surprise
millinborn
did
speak
and
van
heerden
fearful
of
having
his
villainy
exposed
stabbed
him
to
the
heart
under
the
pretext
of
assisting
him
to
lie
down
something
different
occurred
at
the
grand
alliance
hotel
a
man
swoons
immediately
he
is
picked
up
by
the
doctor
who
gives
him
a
harmless
drug
that
is
to
say
harmless
in
small
quantities
in
five
seconds
the
man
is
dead
at
the
inquest
we
find
he
has
been
poisoned
cyanide
is
found
in
his
pocket
and
who
is
this
man
obviously
the
identical
person
who
witnessed
the
murder
of
john
millinborn
and
whom
we
have
been
trying
to
find
ever
since
that
crime
van
heerden
wo
escape
the
third
time
his
presence
will
be
a
little
more
than
a
coincidence
said
the
superintendent
beale
laughed
there
will
be
no
third
time
he
said
shortly
van
heerden
is
not
a
fool
have
you
any
idea
what
the
secret
was
that
he
wanted
to
get
from
old
millinborn
asked
the
detective
beale
nodded
yes
i
know
pretty
well
he
said
and
in
course
of
time
you
will
know
too
the
detective
was
glancing
over
the
newspaper
account
i
see
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
whilst
of
unsound
mind
he
said
this
case
ought
to
injure
van
heerden
anyway
that
is
where
you
are
wrong
said
beale
stopping
in
his
stride
van
heerden
has
so
manoeuvred
the
pressmen
that
he
comes
out
with
an
enhanced
reputation
you
will
probably
find
articles
in
the
weekly
papers
written
and
signed
by
him
giving
his
views
on
the
indiscriminate
sale
of
poisons
he
will
move
in
a
glamour
of
romance
and
his
will
be
thronged
by
new
admirers
it
a
rum
case
said
the
superintendent
rising
and
if
you
mind
my
saying
so
beale
you
one
of
the
rummiest
men
that
figure
in
it
i
ca
quite
make
you
out
you
are
not
a
policeman
and
yet
we
have
orders
from
the
foreign
office
to
give
you
every
assistance
the
game
the
biggest
game
in
the
world
said
beale
promptly
a
game
which
if
it
succeeds
will
bring
misery
and
suffering
to
thousands
and
will
bring
great
businesses
tumbling
and
set
you
and
your
children
and
your
children
children
working
for
hundreds
of
years
to
pay
off
a
new
national
debt
man
alive
said
the
other
are
you
serious
beale
nodded
i
was
never
more
serious
in
my
life
he
said
that
is
why
i
want
the
police
to
be
too
inquisitive
in
regard
to
this
murder
of
jackson
whose
real
name
as
i
say
is
prédeaux
i
can
tell
you
this
chief
that
you
are
seeing
the
development
of
the
most
damnable
plot
that
has
ever
been
hatched
in
the
brain
of
the
worst
miscreant
that
history
knows
sit
down
again
do
you
know
what
happened
last
year
he
asked
last
year
said
the
superintendent
why
the
war
ended
last
year
the
war
ended
germany
was
beaten
and
had
to
accept
terms
humiliating
for
a
proud
nation
but
fortunately
for
her
prussia
was
not
proud
she
was
merely
arrogant
her
worst
blow
was
the
impoverishing
conditions
which
the
entente
powers
imposed
that
is
to
say
they
demanded
certain
concessions
of
territory
and
money
which
added
to
the
enormous
interest
of
war
stock
which
the
germans
had
to
pay
promised
to
cripple
prussia
for
a
hundred
years
well
said
the
detective
when
the
other
had
stopped
well
repeated
beale
with
a
hard
little
smile
germany
is
going
to
get
that
money
back
war
beale
laughed
no
nothing
so
foolish
as
war
germany
has
had
all
the
war
she
wants
oh
no
there
be
no
war
do
you
imagine
that
we
should
go
to
war
because
i
came
to
the
foreign
office
with
a
crazy
story
i
can
tell
you
this
that
officially
the
german
government
have
no
knowledge
of
this
plot
and
are
quite
willing
to
repudiate
those
people
who
are
engaged
in
it
indeed
if
the
truth
be
told
the
government
has
not
contributed
a
single
mark
to
bring
the
scheme
to
fruition
but
when
it
is
working
all
the
money
required
will
be
instantly
found
at
present
the
inventor
of
this
delightful
little
scheme
finds
himself
with
insufficient
capital
to
go
ahead
it
is
his
intention
to
secure
that
capital
there
are
many
ways
by
which
this
can
be
done
he
has
already
borrowed
from
white
of
punsonby
superintendent
mcnorton
whistled
there
are
other
ways
beale
went
on
and
he
is
at
liberty
to
try
them
all
except
one
the
day
he
secures
control
of
that
fortune
that
day
i
shoot
him
the
deuce
you
will
said
the
startled
mcnorton
the
deuce
i
will
repeated
beale
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
mcnorton
rose
do
go
said
beale
i
would
like
to
introduce
you
to
this
gentleman
he
opened
the
door
and
a
man
with
a
lean
ascetic
face
came
in
beale
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
led
the
way
to
the
kitson
i
should
like
you
to
know
superintendent
mcnorton
the
two
men
shook
hands
well
said
kitson
our
medical
friend
seems
to
have
got
away
with
it
he
sat
at
the
table
nervously
drumming
with
his
fingers
does
the
superintendent
know
everything
nearly
everything
replied
beale
nearly
everything
repeated
the
superintendent
with
a
smile
except
this
great
green
rust
business
there
i
admit
i
am
puzzled
even
i
know
nothing
about
that
said
kitson
looking
curiously
at
beale
i
suppose
one
of
these
days
you
will
tell
us
all
about
it
it
is
a
discovery
beale
happed
upon
whilst
he
was
engaged
in
protecting
miss
he
looked
at
beale
and
beale
nodded
miss
cresswell
said
kitson
the
lady
who
was
present
at
the
murder
of
jackson
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
take
you
into
our
confidence
the
more
so
since
the
necessity
for
secrecy
is
rapidly
passing
miss
oliva
cresswell
is
the
niece
of
john
millinborn
her
mother
married
a
scamp
who
called
himself
cresswell
but
whose
real
name
was
prédeaux
he
first
spent
every
penny
she
had
and
then
left
her
and
her
infant
child
prédeaux
cried
the
detective
why
you
told
me
that
was
real
name
jackson
or
prédeaux
was
her
father
said
kitson
it
was
believed
that
he
was
dead
but
after
john
millinborn
death
i
set
inquiries
on
foot
and
discovered
that
he
had
been
serving
a
life
sentence
in
cayenne
and
had
been
released
when
the
french
president
proclaimed
a
general
amnesty
at
the
close
of
the
war
he
was
evidently
on
his
way
to
see
john
millinborn
the
day
my
unhappy
friend
was
murdered
and
it
was
the
recognition
of
his
daughter
in
the
of
the
grand
alliance
which
produced
a
to
which
he
was
subject
but
how
could
he
recognize
the
daughter
had
he
seen
her
before
for
answer
kitson
took
from
his
pocket
a
leather
folder
and
opened
it
there
were
two
photographs
one
of
a
beautiful
woman
in
the
fashion
of
years
before
and
one
a
snapshot
of
a
girl
in
a
modern
costume
whom
mcnorton
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
as
oliva
cresswell
yes
he
said
they
might
be
the
same
person
that
the
mother
on
the
left
explained
kitson
the
resemblance
is
remarkable
when
jackson
saw
the
girl
he
called
her
mary
that
was
his
wife
name
millinborn
left
the
whole
of
his
fortune
to
miss
cresswell
but
he
placed
upon
me
a
solemn
charge
that
she
was
not
to
benefit
or
to
know
of
her
inheritance
until
she
was
married
he
had
a
horror
of
this
was
the
secret
which
van
heerden
surprised
i
fear
with
violence
from
poor
john
as
he
lay
dying
since
then
he
has
been
plotting
to
marry
the
girl
to
do
him
justice
i
believe
that
the
hound
has
no
other
wish
than
to
secure
her
money
his
acquaintance
with
white
who
is
on
the
verge
of
ruin
enabled
him
to
get
to
know
the
girl
he
persuaded
her
to
come
here
and
a
flat
was
found
for
her
partly
said
the
lawyer
dryly
because
this
block
of
flats
happens
to
be
her
own
property
and
the
lady
who
is
supposed
to
be
the
landlady
is
a
nominee
of
mine
and
i
suppose
that
explains
beale
smiled
the
inspector
that
explains
beale
said
kitson
whom
i
brought
from
new
york
especially
to
shadow
van
heerden
and
to
protect
the
girl
in
the
course
of
investigations
beale
has
made
another
discovery
the
particulars
of
which
i
do
not
know
there
was
a
little
pause
why
not
tell
the
girl
said
the
superintendent
kitson
shook
his
head
i
have
thought
it
out
and
to
tell
the
girl
would
be
tantamount
to
breaking
my
faith
with
john
millinborn
no
i
must
simply
shepherd
her
the
first
step
we
must
take
he
turned
to
beale
is
to
get
her
away
from
this
place
ca
you
shift
your
offices
to
say
new
york
beale
shook
his
head
i
can
and
i
ca
he
said
if
you
will
forgive
my
saying
so
the
matter
of
the
green
rust
is
of
infinitely
greater
importance
than
miss
cresswell
safety
james
kitson
frowned
i
do
like
to
hear
you
say
that
beale
i
do
like
hearing
myself
say
it
confessed
the
other
but
let
me
put
it
this
way
i
believe
by
staying
here
i
can
afford
her
greater
protection
and
at
the
same
time
put
a
spoke
in
the
wheel
of
van
heerden
larger
scheme
kitson
pinched
his
lips
thoughtfully
perhaps
you
are
right
he
said
now
i
want
to
see
this
young
lady
that
is
why
i
have
come
i
suppose
there
will
be
no
difficulty
none
at
all
i
think
said
beale
i
will
tell
her
that
you
are
interested
in
the
work
she
is
doing
i
might
introduce
you
as
scobbs
he
smiled
who
is
scobbs
he
is
a
proprietor
of
a
series
of
hotels
in
western
canada
and
is
i
should
imagine
a
most
praiseworthy
and
inoffensive
captain
of
minor
industry
but
miss
cresswell
is
rather
interested
in
him
he
laughed
she
found
the
name
occurring
in
canadian
and
was
struck
by
its
quaintness
scobbs
said
the
lawyer
slowly
i
seem
to
know
that
name
you
had
better
know
it
if
i
am
going
to
introduce
you
as
scobbs
himself
laughed
beale
shall
i
be
in
the
way
asked
the
superintendent
no
please
stay
said
beale
i
would
like
you
to
see
this
lady
we
may
want
your
official
assistance
one
of
these
days
to
get
her
out
of
a
scrape
beale
passed
out
of
the
flat
and
pressed
the
bell
of
the
door
next
to
his
there
was
no
response
he
pressed
it
again
after
an
interval
and
stepped
back
to
look
at
the
fanlight
no
light
showed
and
he
took
out
his
watch
it
was
nine
he
had
not
seen
the
girl
all
day
having
been
present
at
the
inquest
but
he
had
heard
her
door
close
two
hours
before
no
reply
came
to
his
second
ring
and
he
went
back
to
his
flat
she
out
he
said
i
do
quite
understand
it
i
particularly
requested
her
yesterday
not
to
go
out
after
dark
for
a
day
or
two
he
walked
into
his
bedroom
and
opened
the
window
the
light
of
day
was
still
in
the
sky
but
he
took
a
small
electric
lamp
to
guide
him
along
the
narrow
steel
balcony
which
connected
all
the
flats
with
the
he
found
her
window
closed
and
bolted
but
with
the
skill
of
a
professional
burglar
he
unfastened
the
catch
and
stepped
inside
the
room
was
in
darkness
he
switched
on
the
light
and
glanced
round
it
was
oliva
bedroom
and
her
workday
hat
and
coat
were
lying
on
the
bed
he
opened
the
long
cupboard
where
she
kept
her
limited
wardrobe
he
knew
because
it
was
his
business
to
know
every
dress
she
possessed
they
were
all
there
as
also
were
the
three
hats
which
she
kept
on
a
shelf
all
the
drawers
of
the
bureau
were
closed
and
there
was
no
sign
of
any
disorder
such
as
might
be
expected
if
she
had
changed
and
gone
out
he
opened
the
door
of
the
bedroom
and
walked
into
the
lighting
his
way
across
to
the
electric
switch
by
means
of
his
lamp
the
moment
the
light
flooded
the
room
he
realized
that
something
was
wrong
there
was
no
disorder
but
the
room
conveyed
in
some
indescribable
manner
a
suggestion
of
violence
an
object
on
the
floor
attracted
his
attention
and
he
stooped
and
picked
it
up
it
was
a
shoe
and
the
strap
which
had
held
it
in
place
was
broken
he
looked
at
it
slipped
it
in
his
pocket
and
passed
rapidly
through
the
other
rooms
to
the
little
kitchen
and
the
tiny
put
on
the
light
in
the
hall
and
made
a
careful
scrutiny
of
the
walls
and
the
floor
the
mat
was
twisted
out
of
its
place
and
on
the
left
side
of
the
wall
there
were
two
long
scratches
there
was
a
faint
sickly
odour
ether
he
noted
mentally
he
went
quickly
into
the
the
little
was
open
and
a
letter
was
lying
on
the
pad
and
it
was
addressed
to
him
and
ran
dear
beale
circumstances
beyond
my
control
make
it
necessary
for
me
to
leave
for
liverpool
that
was
all
it
was
obviously
half
finished
he
picked
it
up
folded
it
carefully
and
slipped
it
in
his
pocket
then
he
returned
to
the
hall
opened
the
door
and
passed
out
he
explained
briefly
what
had
happened
and
crossed
to
the
doctor
flat
and
rang
the
bell
chapter
x
a
fruitless
search
a
light
glowed
in
the
hall
the
door
was
opened
and
the
doctor
in
slippers
and
velvet
coat
stood
in
the
entrance
he
showed
no
resentment
nor
did
he
have
time
to
show
it
i
want
a
word
with
you
said
beale
twenty
if
you
wish
said
the
doctor
cheerfully
wo
you
come
in
beale
was
in
before
the
invitation
was
issued
and
followed
the
doctor
to
his
study
are
you
alone
he
asked
quite
alone
i
have
very
few
visitors
in
fact
my
last
visitor
was
that
unhappy
man
jackson
when
did
you
see
miss
cresswell
last
the
doctor
raised
his
eyebrows
by
what
right
he
began
cut
all
that
out
said
beale
roughly
when
did
you
see
miss
cresswell
last
i
have
not
seen
her
said
the
doctor
i
have
not
been
out
of
my
flat
since
i
came
back
from
the
inquest
i
should
like
to
search
your
flat
said
beale
policeman
eh
smiled
the
doctor
certainly
you
can
search
the
flat
if
you
have
a
warrant
i
have
no
warrant
but
i
shall
search
your
flat
the
doctor
face
went
dull
red
i
suppose
you
know
you
are
liable
to
an
action
for
trespass
i
know
all
about
that
said
beale
but
if
you
have
nothing
to
conceal
van
heerden
i
do
see
why
you
should
object
i
do
object
shrugged
the
doctor
search
by
all
means
where
would
you
like
to
start
here
he
pointed
to
three
upright
cases
which
stood
at
the
end
of
the
room
nearest
the
door
you
will
see
nothing
very
pleasant
here
they
are
anatomical
models
which
have
just
arrived
from
berlin
in
fact
i
have
been
trading
with
the
enemy
he
smiled
they
are
screwed
up
but
i
have
a
screwdriver
here
beale
hesitated
there
is
only
another
room
the
doctor
went
on
my
bedroom
but
you
will
not
find
her
there
beale
twisted
round
like
lightning
her
he
asked
who
said
her
i
gather
you
are
looking
for
miss
cresswell
said
the
doctor
coolly
you
are
searching
for
something
and
you
ask
me
when
i
saw
her
last
who
else
could
you
be
looking
for
quite
right
he
said
quietly
let
me
show
you
the
way
the
doctor
walked
ahead
and
turned
on
the
light
in
the
inner
bedroom
it
was
a
large
apartment
simply
furnished
with
a
small
steel
bed
a
hanging
wardrobe
and
a
beyond
that
was
his
beale
was
making
a
casual
survey
of
this
when
he
heard
the
door
of
the
bedroom
click
behind
him
he
turned
round
jumped
for
the
door
turned
the
handle
and
pulled
but
it
did
not
yield
as
he
did
so
he
thought
he
heard
a
mutter
of
voices
open
the
door
he
cried
hammering
on
the
panel
there
was
no
answer
then
mr
beale
his
blood
froze
at
the
wild
appeal
in
the
tone
for
it
was
the
voice
of
oliva
cresswell
and
it
came
from
the
room
he
had
quitted
he
smashed
at
the
panel
but
it
was
made
of
tough
oak
his
revolver
was
in
his
hand
and
the
muzzle
was
against
the
lock
when
the
handle
turned
and
the
door
opened
did
you
lock
yourself
in
smiled
the
doctor
looking
blandly
at
the
other
pale
face
where
is
the
girl
where
is
miss
cresswell
he
demanded
i
heard
her
voice
you
are
mad
my
friend
where
is
miss
cresswell
his
hand
dropped
on
the
other
shoulder
and
gripped
it
with
a
force
that
made
the
other
shrink
with
an
oath
the
doctor
flung
him
off
hang
you
you
madman
how
should
i
know
i
heard
her
voice
it
was
imagination
said
the
doctor
i
would
have
opened
the
door
to
you
before
but
i
had
walked
out
into
the
passage
and
had
rung
miss
cresswell
bell
i
found
the
door
open
i
suppose
you
had
been
in
i
just
shut
the
door
and
came
back
here
without
a
word
beale
thrust
him
aside
he
had
taken
one
step
to
the
door
when
he
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
room
had
been
the
three
long
anatomical
cases
now
there
were
only
two
one
had
gone
he
did
not
stop
to
question
the
man
he
bounded
through
the
door
and
raced
down
the
stairs
there
was
no
vehicle
in
sight
and
only
a
few
pedestrians
at
the
corner
of
the
street
he
found
a
policeman
who
had
witnessed
nothing
unusual
and
had
not
seen
any
conveyance
carrying
a
box
as
he
returned
slowly
to
the
entrance
of
krooman
mansions
something
made
him
look
up
the
doctor
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
smoking
a
cigar
found
her
he
asked
mockingly
beale
made
no
reply
he
came
up
the
stairs
walked
straight
through
the
open
door
of
the
doctor
flat
and
confronted
that
calm
man
as
he
leant
against
the
table
his
hands
gripping
the
edge
a
cigar
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
a
smile
of
quiet
amusement
on
his
bearded
lips
well
he
asked
did
you
find
her
i
did
not
find
her
but
i
am
satisfied
that
will
van
heerden
eyes
did
not
falter
i
am
beginning
to
think
beale
that
in
alcoholic
stimulants
has
turned
your
brain
he
said
mockingly
you
come
into
my
apartment
and
demand
with
an
heroic
gesture
where
i
am
concealing
a
beautiful
young
lady
in
whose
welfare
i
am
at
least
as
much
interested
as
you
since
that
lady
is
my
fiancée
and
is
going
to
be
my
wife
there
was
a
pause
she
is
going
to
be
your
wife
is
she
said
beale
softly
i
congratulate
you
if
i
can
not
congratulate
her
and
when
is
this
interesting
engagement
to
be
announced
it
is
announced
at
this
moment
said
the
doctor
the
lady
is
on
her
way
to
liverpool
where
she
will
stay
with
an
aunt
of
mine
you
need
not
trouble
to
ask
me
for
her
address
because
i
shall
not
give
it
to
you
i
see
said
beale
you
come
in
here
i
repeat
demanding
with
all
the
gesture
and
voice
of
melodrama
the
of
my
fiancée
he
enunciated
the
two
last
words
with
great
relish
you
ask
to
search
my
rooms
and
i
give
you
permission
you
lock
yourself
in
through
your
own
carelessness
and
when
i
release
you
you
have
a
revolver
in
your
hand
and
are
even
more
melodramatic
than
ever
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
you
are
a
clever
man
interrupted
beale
for
i
do
know
myself
you
were
going
to
say
or
you
think
that
i
have
some
sinister
purpose
in
concealing
this
lady
well
to
resume
my
narrative
and
to
show
you
your
conduct
from
my
point
of
view
i
no
sooner
release
you
than
you
stare
like
a
lunatic
at
my
anatomical
cases
and
dash
wildly
out
to
return
full
of
menace
in
your
tone
and
attitude
why
doctor
van
heerden
when
i
came
into
your
flat
there
were
three
anatomical
cases
at
the
end
of
that
room
when
i
came
out
there
were
two
what
happened
to
the
third
whilst
i
was
locked
in
the
room
doctor
van
heerden
shook
his
head
pityingly
i
am
afraid
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
you
are
not
right
in
your
head
he
said
and
nodded
toward
the
place
where
the
cases
stood
beale
followed
the
direction
of
his
head
and
gasped
for
there
were
three
cases
i
admit
that
i
deceived
you
when
i
said
they
contained
specimens
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
are
empty
said
the
doctor
if
you
like
to
inspect
them
you
can
you
may
find
some
clue
beale
wanted
no
invitation
he
walked
to
the
cases
one
by
one
and
sounded
them
their
lids
were
screwed
on
but
the
screws
were
dummies
he
found
in
the
side
of
each
a
minute
hole
under
the
cover
of
the
lid
and
taking
out
his
knife
he
pressed
in
the
bodkin
with
which
the
knife
was
equipped
and
with
a
click
the
lid
flew
open
the
box
was
empty
the
second
one
answered
the
same
test
and
was
also
empty
the
third
gave
no
better
result
he
flashed
his
lamp
on
the
bottom
of
the
box
but
there
was
no
trace
of
footmarks
are
you
satisfied
asked
the
doctor
far
from
satisfied
said
beale
and
with
no
other
word
he
walked
out
and
down
the
stairs
again
down
he
saw
something
lying
on
one
of
the
stairs
and
picked
it
up
it
was
a
shoe
the
fellow
of
that
which
he
had
in
his
pocket
and
it
had
not
been
there
when
he
came
up
oliva
cresswell
had
read
the
story
of
the
crime
in
the
had
folded
up
the
paper
with
a
little
shiver
and
was
at
her
tiny
when
a
knock
came
at
the
door
it
was
van
heerden
can
i
come
in
for
a
moment
he
asked
she
hesitated
i
sha
eat
you
he
smiled
but
i
am
so
distressed
by
what
has
happened
and
i
feel
that
an
explanation
is
due
to
you
i
should
trouble
about
that
she
smiled
but
if
you
want
to
come
in
please
do
she
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
left
the
light
burning
in
the
hall
she
did
not
ask
him
to
sit
down
you
have
seen
the
account
in
the
he
asked
she
nodded
and
i
suppose
you
are
rather
struck
with
the
discrepancy
between
what
i
told
you
and
what
i
told
the
reporters
but
i
feel
you
ought
to
know
that
i
had
a
very
special
reason
for
protecting
this
man
of
that
i
have
no
doubt
she
said
coldly
miss
cresswell
you
must
be
patient
and
kind
to
me
he
said
earnestly
i
have
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
and
i
have
run
very
considerable
dangers
in
order
to
save
you
to
save
me
she
repeated
in
surprise
miss
cresswell
he
asked
did
you
ever
know
your
father
she
shook
her
head
so
impressed
by
the
gravity
of
his
tone
that
she
did
not
cut
the
conversation
short
as
she
had
intended
no
she
said
i
was
a
girl
when
he
died
i
know
nothing
of
him
even
his
own
people
who
brought
him
up
never
spoke
of
him
are
you
sure
he
is
dead
he
asked
sure
i
have
never
doubted
it
why
do
you
ask
me
is
he
alive
he
nodded
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
will
be
rather
painful
he
said
your
father
was
a
notorious
swindler
he
paused
but
she
did
not
protest
in
her
life
she
had
heard
many
hints
which
did
not
redound
to
her
father
credit
and
she
had
purposely
refrained
from
pursuing
her
inquiries
some
time
ago
your
father
escaped
from
cayenne
he
is
you
will
be
surprised
to
know
a
french
subject
and
the
police
have
been
searching
for
him
for
twelve
months
including
our
friend
mr
beale
it
is
true
she
flamed
how
dare
you
suggest
i
am
merely
telling
you
the
facts
miss
cresswell
and
you
must
judge
them
for
yourself
said
the
doctor
your
father
robbed
a
bank
in
france
and
hid
the
money
in
england
because
they
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
send
for
you
the
police
have
been
watching
you
day
and
night
your
father
is
at
liverpool
i
had
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
he
is
dying
and
he
begs
you
to
go
to
him
she
sat
at
the
table
stunned
there
was
in
this
story
a
hideous
probability
her
first
inclination
was
to
consult
beale
but
instantly
she
saw
that
if
what
the
doctor
had
said
was
true
such
a
course
would
be
fatal
how
do
i
know
you
are
speaking
the
truth
she
asked
you
can
not
know
until
you
have
seen
your
father
he
said
it
is
a
very
simple
matter
he
took
from
his
pocket
an
envelope
and
laid
it
before
her
here
is
the
address
hope
street
i
advise
you
to
commit
it
to
memory
and
tear
it
up
after
all
what
possible
interest
could
i
have
in
your
going
to
liverpool
or
anywhere
else
for
the
matter
of
that
when
is
the
next
train
she
asked
one
leaves
in
an
hour
from
euston
she
thought
a
moment
i
go
she
said
decidedly
she
was
walking
back
to
her
room
to
put
on
her
coat
when
he
called
her
back
there
no
reason
in
the
world
why
you
should
not
write
to
beale
to
tell
him
where
you
have
gone
he
said
you
can
leave
a
note
with
me
and
i
will
deliver
it
she
hesitated
again
sat
down
at
her
desk
and
scribbled
the
few
lines
which
beale
had
found
then
she
twisted
round
in
her
chair
in
perplexity
i
do
understand
it
all
she
said
if
beale
is
on
the
track
of
my
father
surely
he
will
understand
from
this
letter
that
i
have
gone
to
meet
him
let
me
see
what
you
have
written
said
van
heerden
coolly
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
yes
that
enough
he
said
enough
quite
enough
you
see
my
idea
was
that
you
should
write
sufficient
to
put
him
off
the
track
i
do
understand
you
there
somebody
in
the
passage
she
said
suddenly
and
was
walking
to
the
door
leading
to
the
hall
when
he
intercepted
her
miss
cresswell
i
think
you
will
understand
me
when
i
tell
you
that
your
father
is
dead
that
the
story
i
have
told
you
about
beale
being
on
his
track
is
quite
untrue
and
that
it
is
necessary
for
a
purpose
which
i
will
not
disclose
to
you
that
you
should
be
my
wife
she
sprang
back
out
of
his
reach
white
as
death
instinctively
she
realized
that
she
was
in
some
terrible
danger
and
the
knowledge
turned
her
cold
your
wife
she
repeated
i
think
you
must
be
mad
doctor
on
the
contrary
i
am
perfectly
sane
i
would
have
asked
you
before
but
i
knew
that
you
would
refuse
me
had
our
friend
beale
not
interfered
the
course
of
true
love
might
have
run
a
little
more
smoothly
than
it
has
now
i
am
going
to
speak
plainly
to
you
miss
cresswell
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
marry
you
and
if
you
agree
i
shall
take
you
away
and
place
you
in
safe
keeping
i
will
marry
you
at
the
registrar
office
and
part
from
you
the
moment
the
ceremony
is
completed
i
will
agree
to
allow
you
a
thousand
a
year
and
i
will
promise
that
i
will
not
interfere
with
you
or
in
any
way
seek
your
society
her
courage
had
revived
during
this
recital
of
her
future
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
she
asked
contemptuously
fall
on
your
neck
and
thank
you
you
with
your
thousand
a
year
and
your
partings
no
doctor
if
you
are
sane
then
you
are
either
a
great
fool
or
a
great
scoundrel
i
would
never
dream
of
marrying
you
under
any
circumstances
and
now
i
think
you
had
better
go
this
time
he
did
not
stop
her
as
she
walked
to
the
door
and
flung
it
open
she
started
back
with
an
exclamation
of
fear
for
there
were
two
men
in
the
hall
what
do
you
so
far
she
got
when
the
doctor
arm
was
round
her
and
his
hand
was
pressed
against
her
mouth
one
of
the
men
was
carrying
what
looked
like
a
rubber
bottle
with
a
mouthpiece
she
struggled
but
the
doctor
held
her
in
a
grip
of
steel
she
was
thrown
to
the
ground
the
rubber
cap
of
the
bottle
was
pressed
over
her
face
there
came
a
rush
of
cold
air
heavily
charged
with
a
sickly
scent
and
she
felt
life
slipping
away
i
think
she
off
now
said
the
doctor
lifting
up
her
eyelid
see
if
the
coast
is
clear
gregory
and
open
the
door
of
my
flat
the
man
departed
the
doctor
lifted
the
unconscious
girl
in
his
arms
he
was
in
the
hall
when
he
felt
her
move
as
she
was
she
was
struggling
to
prevent
the
abduction
quick
the
door
he
gasped
he
carried
her
across
the
landing
into
his
room
and
the
door
closed
quietly
behind
him
chapter
xi
the
house
near
staines
oliva
cresswell
remembered
nothing
she
did
not
remember
being
thrust
limply
into
a
long
narrow
box
nor
hearing
beale
voice
nor
the
click
of
the
door
that
fastened
him
in
van
heerden
bedroom
if
she
cried
out
as
she
did
she
had
no
recollection
of
the
fact
carry
her
box
and
all
to
her
flat
the
door
is
open
whispered
van
heerden
to
the
two
men
who
had
made
their
lightning
disappearance
into
the
anatomical
cases
at
the
sound
of
beale
knock
what
shall
we
do
wait
till
i
come
to
you
hurry
they
crossed
the
landing
and
passed
through
the
open
door
of
flat
and
the
doctor
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
returned
in
time
to
release
the
savage
beale
he
watched
him
racing
down
the
stairs
darted
to
the
door
of
rooms
opened
it
and
went
in
in
ten
seconds
she
had
been
lifted
from
her
narrow
prison
and
laid
on
her
bed
the
box
had
been
returned
to
the
place
where
it
had
stood
in
the
doctor
study
and
the
men
had
returned
to
join
van
heerden
in
oliva
darkened
van
heerden
had
switched
on
the
light
in
the
girl
room
and
then
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
one
of
her
shoes
was
missing
quickly
he
slipped
off
the
remaining
shoe
you
wait
here
he
told
the
men
until
you
hear
beale
return
then
make
your
escape
on
your
way
down
leave
the
shoe
on
the
stairs
it
will
help
to
put
our
friend
off
the
trail
half
an
hour
after
the
discovery
of
the
shoe
on
the
stairs
beale
went
out
accompanied
by
his
visitors
the
doctor
watched
the
dark
figures
disappear
into
the
night
from
the
window
of
his
and
made
his
way
back
to
the
girl
flat
she
was
lying
where
he
had
left
her
feeling
dizzy
and
sick
her
eyes
closed
in
a
little
grimace
of
distaste
as
he
put
on
the
light
how
does
my
little
friend
feel
now
he
asked
coolly
she
made
no
reply
really
you
must
not
sulk
he
said
chidingly
and
you
must
get
used
to
being
polite
because
you
are
going
to
see
a
great
deal
of
me
you
had
better
get
up
and
put
your
coat
on
she
noticed
that
he
had
a
medicine
glass
in
his
hand
with
a
liquor
drink
this
he
said
she
pushed
it
away
come
drink
it
he
said
you
do
suppose
i
want
to
poison
you
do
you
i
do
even
want
to
drug
you
otherwise
it
would
have
been
simple
to
have
given
you
a
little
more
ether
drink
it
it
will
take
that
hazy
feeling
out
of
your
head
she
took
the
glass
with
an
unsteady
hand
and
swallowed
its
contents
it
was
bitter
and
hot
and
burnt
her
throat
but
its
effects
were
magical
in
three
minutes
her
mind
had
cleared
and
when
she
sat
up
she
could
do
so
without
her
head
swimming
you
will
now
put
on
your
coat
and
hat
pack
a
few
things
that
you
want
for
a
journey
and
come
along
with
me
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
she
said
i
advise
you
to
go
van
heerden
before
i
inform
the
police
of
your
outrageous
conduct
put
on
your
hat
and
coat
he
repeated
calmly
and
do
talk
nonsense
you
do
suppose
that
i
have
risked
all
that
i
have
risked
to
let
you
go
at
this
hour
van
heerden
she
said
if
you
have
any
spark
of
decency
or
manhood
you
will
leave
me
he
laughed
a
little
now
you
are
talking
like
a
heroine
of
lyceum
drama
he
said
any
appeal
you
might
make
miss
cresswell
is
a
waste
of
time
and
a
waste
of
breath
i
shall
have
no
hesitation
in
using
violence
of
the
most
unpleasant
character
unless
you
do
as
i
tell
you
his
voice
was
quiet
but
there
was
about
him
a
convincing
air
of
purpose
where
are
you
going
to
take
me
she
asked
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
a
place
of
safety
when
i
say
safety
he
added
i
mean
safety
for
me
you
yourself
need
fear
nothing
unless
you
act
foolishly
in
which
case
you
have
everything
to
fear
disabuse
your
mind
of
one
thought
miss
cresswell
he
said
and
that
is
that
i
am
in
love
with
you
and
that
there
is
any
quality
or
charm
in
your
admirable
person
which
would
prevent
my
cutting
your
throat
if
it
was
necessary
for
my
safety
i
am
not
a
brute
i
will
treat
you
decently
as
well
as
any
lady
could
wish
to
be
treated
if
you
do
not
cross
me
but
i
warn
you
that
if
in
the
street
you
call
for
help
or
attempt
to
escape
you
will
never
know
what
happened
to
you
she
stood
at
the
end
of
her
bed
one
hand
gripping
the
rail
her
white
teeth
showing
against
the
red
lower
lip
do
bite
your
lips
it
does
not
stimulate
thought
i
can
tell
you
that
as
a
medical
man
and
i
can
also
tell
you
that
this
is
not
the
moment
for
you
to
consider
plans
for
outwitting
me
get
your
coat
and
hat
on
his
voice
was
now
peremptory
and
she
obeyed
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
dressed
ready
for
the
street
he
led
the
way
out
and
holding
her
arm
lightly
they
passed
out
into
the
street
he
turned
sharply
to
the
left
the
girl
keeping
in
step
by
his
side
to
the
casual
observer
and
few
could
observe
them
in
the
gloom
of
the
thoroughfares
through
which
they
passed
they
were
a
couple
on
affectionate
terms
but
the
arm
locked
in
hers
was
the
arm
of
a
gaoler
and
once
when
they
stood
waiting
to
cross
busy
oxford
circus
and
she
had
seen
a
policeman
a
few
yards
away
and
had
cautiously
tried
to
slip
her
arm
from
his
she
found
her
wrist
gripped
with
a
hand
of
steel
at
the
marylebone
road
end
of
portland
place
a
car
was
waiting
and
the
doctor
opened
the
door
and
pushed
her
in
following
immediately
i
had
to
keep
the
car
some
distance
from
krooman
mansions
or
beale
would
have
spotted
it
immediately
he
said
in
an
easy
conversational
tone
where
are
you
taking
me
she
asked
to
a
highly
desirable
residence
in
the
thames
valley
he
said
in
the
days
when
i
thought
you
might
be
wooed
and
wed
as
the
saying
goes
i
thought
it
might
make
an
excellent
place
for
a
honeymoon
he
felt
her
shrink
from
him
please
do
be
distressed
i
am
rather
glad
that
matters
have
turned
out
as
they
have
i
do
not
like
women
very
much
and
i
should
have
been
inexpressibly
bored
if
i
had
to
keep
up
the
fiction
of
being
in
love
with
you
what
do
you
intend
doing
she
asked
you
can
not
hope
to
escape
from
beale
he
will
find
me
he
chuckled
as
a
beale
has
his
points
he
said
but
they
are
not
points
which
keep
me
awake
at
night
i
have
always
suspected
he
was
a
detective
and
of
course
it
was
he
who
planted
the
registered
envelopes
on
poor
old
white
that
was
clever
he
admitted
handsomely
but
beale
if
you
will
excuse
my
hurting
your
feelings
and
i
know
you
are
half
in
love
with
him
she
felt
her
face
go
hot
how
dare
you
she
flamed
do
be
silly
he
begged
i
dare
anything
in
these
circumstances
the
greater
outrage
includes
the
less
if
i
abdicate
you
i
feel
myself
entitled
to
tease
you
no
i
think
you
had
better
not
place
too
much
faith
in
beale
who
does
seem
to
be
a
member
of
the
regular
police
force
and
is
i
presume
one
of
those
amateur
gentlemen
who
figure
in
divorce
cases
she
did
not
reply
inwardly
she
was
boiling
and
she
recognized
with
a
little
feeling
of
dismay
that
it
was
not
so
much
the
indignity
which
he
was
offering
her
as
his
undisguised
contempt
for
the
genius
of
beale
which
enraged
her
they
had
left
the
town
and
were
spinning
through
the
country
when
she
spoke
again
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
what
you
intend
doing
he
had
fallen
into
a
reverie
and
it
was
evidently
a
pleasant
reverie
for
he
came
back
to
the
realities
of
life
with
an
air
of
reluctance
eh
oh
what
am
i
going
to
do
with
you
why
i
am
going
to
marry
you
suppose
i
refuse
you
wo
refuse
i
am
offering
you
the
easiest
way
out
when
you
are
married
to
me
your
danger
is
at
an
end
until
you
marry
me
your
hold
on
life
is
somewhat
precarious
but
why
do
you
insist
upon
this
she
asked
bewildered
if
you
love
me
what
is
there
in
marriage
for
you
there
are
plenty
of
women
who
would
be
delighted
to
have
you
why
should
you
want
to
marry
a
girl
without
any
influence
or
position
a
absolutely
penniless
it
a
whim
of
mine
he
said
lightly
and
it
a
whim
i
mean
to
gratify
suppose
i
refuse
at
the
last
moment
then
he
said
significantly
you
will
be
sorry
i
tell
you
no
harm
is
coming
to
you
if
you
are
sensible
if
you
are
not
sensible
imagine
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
you
and
that
will
be
the
least
i
will
treat
you
so
that
you
will
not
think
of
your
experience
let
alone
talk
of
it
there
was
a
cold
malignity
in
his
voice
that
made
her
shudder
for
a
moment
and
a
moment
only
she
was
beaten
down
by
the
horrible
hopelessness
of
her
situation
then
her
natural
courage
her
indomitable
overcame
fear
if
he
expected
an
outburst
of
anger
and
incoherent
reproach
or
if
he
expected
her
to
break
down
into
hysterical
supplication
he
was
disappointed
she
had
a
firm
grip
upon
herself
perfect
command
of
voice
and
words
i
suppose
you
are
one
of
those
clever
criminals
one
reads
about
she
said
prepared
for
all
emergencies
perfectly
capable
and
satisfied
that
there
is
nobody
quite
so
clever
as
themselves
very
likely
he
smiled
it
is
a
form
of
egotism
he
said
quietly
i
read
a
book
once
about
criminals
it
was
written
by
an
italian
and
he
said
that
was
the
chief
characteristic
of
them
all
vanity
and
they
always
do
such
clever
things
and
such
stupid
things
at
the
same
time
and
their
beautiful
plans
are
so
full
of
absurd
miscalculations
just
as
yours
are
just
as
mine
are
he
said
mockingly
just
as
yours
are
she
repeated
you
are
so
satisfied
that
because
you
are
educated
and
you
are
a
scientist
that
you
are
ever
so
much
more
clever
than
all
the
rest
of
the
world
go
on
he
said
i
like
to
hear
you
talking
your
analysis
is
nearly
perfect
and
certainly
there
is
a
lot
of
truth
in
what
you
say
she
held
down
the
surging
anger
which
almost
choked
her
and
retained
a
calm
level
sooner
or
later
she
would
find
the
joint
in
his
harness
i
suppose
you
have
everything
ready
my
staff
work
is
always
good
he
murmured
marriage
licence
parson
even
the
place
where
you
will
spend
your
solitary
honeymoon
after
signing
a
few
documents
she
turned
toward
him
slowly
against
the
window
of
the
big
limousine
his
head
was
faintly
outlined
and
she
imagined
the
smile
which
was
on
his
face
at
that
moment
so
that
is
it
she
said
i
must
sign
a
few
documents
saying
that
i
married
you
of
my
own
free
will
no
madam
he
said
the
circumstances
under
which
you
marry
me
require
no
justification
and
that
does
worry
me
in
the
slightest
what
documents
have
i
to
sign
she
asked
you
will
discover
in
time
said
he
here
is
the
house
unless
my
eyesight
has
gone
wrong
the
car
turned
from
the
road
seemed
to
plunge
into
a
high
hedge
though
in
reality
as
the
girl
saw
for
a
second
as
the
lamps
caught
the
stone
it
was
the
entrance
to
a
drive
and
presently
came
to
a
stop
before
a
big
rambling
house
van
heerden
jumped
down
and
assisted
her
to
alight
the
house
was
in
darkness
but
as
they
reached
the
door
it
was
opened
go
in
said
van
heerden
and
pushed
her
ahead
she
found
herself
in
an
hall
the
walls
panelled
of
oak
the
floor
made
of
closely
mortised
stone
flags
she
recognized
the
man
who
had
admitted
them
as
one
of
those
she
had
seen
in
her
flat
that
same
night
he
was
a
cadaverous
man
with
high
cheekbones
and
short
bristly
black
hair
and
a
tiny
black
moustache
i
wo
introduce
you
said
the
doctor
but
you
may
call
this
man
gregory
it
is
not
his
name
but
it
is
good
enough
the
man
smiled
furtively
and
eyed
her
furtively
took
up
the
candle
and
led
the
way
to
a
room
which
opened
off
the
hall
at
the
farther
end
this
is
the
said
van
heerden
it
is
chiefly
interesting
to
you
as
the
place
where
the
ceremony
will
be
performed
your
room
is
immediately
above
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
engage
a
maid
for
you
but
i
can
not
afford
to
observe
the
proprieties
or
consider
your
reputation
the
fact
is
i
know
no
woman
i
could
trust
to
perform
that
duty
and
you
will
have
to
look
after
yourself
he
led
the
way
upstairs
unlocked
a
door
and
passed
in
there
was
one
window
which
was
heavily
curtained
he
saw
her
glance
and
nodded
you
will
find
the
windows
barred
he
said
this
was
evidently
the
nursery
and
is
admirably
suited
to
my
purpose
in
addition
i
might
tell
you
that
the
house
is
a
very
old
one
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
walk
about
the
room
without
the
door
creaking
and
as
i
spend
most
of
my
time
in
the
below
you
will
find
it
extremely
difficult
even
to
make
preparations
for
escape
without
my
being
aware
of
the
fact
the
room
was
comfortably
furnished
a
small
fire
was
alight
in
the
tiny
grate
and
a
table
had
been
laid
on
which
were
displayed
sandwiches
a
thermos
flask
and
a
small
silver
basket
of
confectionery
there
was
a
door
by
the
big
bed
you
may
consider
yourself
fortunate
in
having
the
only
room
in
the
house
with
a
attached
he
said
you
english
people
are
rather
particular
about
that
kind
of
thing
and
you
german
people
are
she
said
coolly
german
he
laughed
so
you
guessed
that
did
you
guessed
it
it
was
her
turn
to
laugh
scornfully
is
the
fact
who
but
a
hun
his
face
went
a
dull
red
that
is
a
word
you
must
not
use
to
me
he
said
roughly
hang
your
arrogance
huns
we
who
gave
the
world
its
kultur
who
lead
in
every
department
of
science
art
and
literature
she
stared
at
him
in
amazement
you
are
joking
of
course
she
said
forgetting
her
danger
for
the
moment
in
face
of
this
extraordinary
phenomenon
if
you
are
a
german
and
i
suppose
you
are
and
an
educated
german
at
that
you
do
for
a
moment
imagine
you
gave
the
world
anything
why
the
germans
have
never
been
anything
but
exploiters
of
other
men
brains
from
dull
red
his
face
had
gone
white
his
lip
was
trembling
with
passion
and
when
he
spoke
he
could
scarcely
control
his
voice
we
were
of
all
people
ordained
by
god
to
save
the
world
through
the
german
spirit
so
far
he
got
when
she
burst
into
a
fit
of
uncontrollable
laughter
it
was
so
like
all
the
caricatures
of
german
character
she
had
read
or
seen
depicted
he
looked
at
her
his
face
distorted
with
rage
and
before
she
had
realized
what
had
happened
he
had
raised
his
hand
and
struck
her
across
the
mouth
she
staggered
back
speechless
to
her
had
happened
the
most
incredible
thing
in
the
world
more
incredible
than
her
abduction
more
incredible
than
all
the
villainies
known
or
suspected
in
this
man
he
stood
there
glowering
at
her
unrepentant
it
seemed
to
repeat
the
blow
he
had
struck
a
woman
and
was
not
overwhelmed
by
shame
all
her
views
of
men
and
things
all
her
conceptions
of
the
codes
which
govern
mankind
in
their
dealings
one
with
the
other
crumbled
away
if
he
had
fallen
on
his
knees
and
asked
her
pardon
if
he
had
shown
any
contrition
any
fear
any
shame
she
might
have
gone
back
to
her
old
standards
you
swine
cat
he
said
in
german
herr
gott
but
i
will
punish
you
if
you
laugh
at
me
she
was
staring
at
him
in
intense
curiosity
her
lip
was
bleeding
a
little
the
red
mark
of
his
fingers
showed
against
her
white
face
but
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
pain
or
the
shock
of
the
actual
blow
and
was
wholly
concerned
in
this
new
revelation
a
hun
she
said
but
she
seemed
to
be
speaking
to
herself
of
course
he
a
hun
they
do
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
never
believed
it
before
he
took
a
step
toward
her
but
she
did
not
flinch
and
he
turned
and
walked
quickly
from
the
room
locking
the
door
behind
him
chapter
xii
introducing
parson
homo
when
beale
left
krooman
mansions
with
his
two
companions
he
had
only
the
haziest
idea
as
to
where
he
should
begin
his
search
perhaps
the
personal
interest
he
had
in
his
client
an
interest
revealed
by
the
momentary
panic
into
which
her
disappearance
had
thrown
this
usually
collected
young
man
clouded
his
better
judgment
a
vague
discomfort
possessed
him
and
he
paused
irresolutely
at
the
corner
of
the
street
there
was
a
chance
that
she
might
still
be
concealed
in
the
building
but
a
greater
chance
that
if
he
followed
one
of
the
three
plans
which
were
rapidly
forming
in
his
mind
he
might
save
the
girl
from
whatever
danger
threatened
her
you
are
perfectly
sure
you
heard
her
voice
certain
replied
beale
shortly
just
as
i
am
sure
that
i
smelt
the
ether
she
may
have
been
using
it
for
some
other
purpose
women
put
these
drugs
to
all
sorts
of
weird
purposes
like
cleaning
gloves
and
that
may
be
interrupted
beale
but
i
was
mistaken
about
her
voice
i
am
not
subject
to
illusions
of
that
kind
he
whistled
a
man
who
had
been
lurking
in
the
shadow
of
a
building
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
crossed
to
him
fenson
said
beale
watch
these
flats
if
you
see
a
car
drive
up
just
go
along
and
stand
in
front
of
the
door
do
let
anybody
enter
that
car
or
carry
any
bundle
into
that
car
until
you
are
sure
that
miss
cresswell
is
not
one
of
the
party
or
the
bundle
if
necessary
you
can
pull
a
gun
i
know
it
is
done
in
london
he
smiled
at
superintendent
mcnorton
but
i
guess
you
got
to
let
me
do
a
little
go
all
the
way
said
the
superintendent
easily
that
will
do
fenson
you
know
miss
cresswell
sure
sir
said
the
man
and
melted
back
into
the
shadows
where
are
you
going
now
asked
kitson
i
am
going
to
interview
a
gentleman
who
will
probably
give
me
a
great
deal
of
information
about
van
heerden
other
residences
has
he
many
asked
kitson
in
surprise
beale
nodded
he
has
been
hiring
buildings
and
houses
for
the
past
three
months
he
said
quietly
and
he
has
been
so
clever
that
i
will
defy
you
to
trace
one
of
them
all
his
hiring
has
been
done
through
various
lawyers
he
has
employed
and
they
are
all
taken
in
fictitious
names
do
you
know
any
of
them
not
one
said
beale
with
a
baffled
little
laugh
did
i
tell
you
he
mighty
clever
i
got
track
of
two
of
them
but
they
were
the
only
two
where
the
sale
did
go
through
what
does
he
want
houses
for
we
shall
learn
one
of
these
days
said
beale
cryptically
i
can
tell
you
something
else
gentlemen
and
this
is
more
of
a
suspicion
than
a
certainty
that
there
is
not
a
crank
scientist
who
has
ever
gone
under
through
drink
or
crime
in
the
whole
of
this
country
aye
and
america
and
france
too
that
is
working
for
him
and
now
gentlemen
if
you
will
excuse
me
you
do
want
any
assistance
asked
the
superintendent
i
guess
not
said
beale
with
a
smile
i
guess
i
can
manage
the
herr
professor
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
thames
is
a
congested
and
thickly
populated
area
lying
between
the
waterloo
and
the
blackfriars
roads
here
old
houses
which
are
gauntly
picturesque
because
of
their
age
stand
with
great
blocks
of
model
dwellings
which
make
up
in
utility
all
that
they
lack
in
beauty
such
have
a
double
advantage
their
rent
is
low
and
they
are
close
to
the
centre
of
london
few
of
the
houses
are
occupied
by
one
family
and
indeed
it
is
the
exception
that
one
family
rents
in
its
entirety
so
much
as
a
floor
in
a
basement
room
in
one
of
those
houses
sat
two
men
as
unlike
one
another
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
the
room
itself
was
strangely
tidy
and
bare
of
anything
but
the
necessary
furniture
a
camp
bed
was
under
the
window
in
such
a
position
as
to
give
its
occupant
a
view
of
the
ankles
of
those
people
who
trod
the
pavement
of
the
little
street
a
faded
cretonne
curtain
hid
an
inner
and
probably
a
smaller
room
where
the
elder
of
the
men
slept
they
sat
on
either
side
of
a
table
a
kerosene
lamp
placed
exactly
in
the
centre
supplying
light
for
their
various
occupations
the
elder
of
the
two
was
bent
forward
over
a
microscope
his
big
hands
adjusting
the
focus
screw
presently
he
would
break
off
his
work
of
observation
and
jot
down
a
few
notes
in
crabbed
german
characters
his
big
head
his
squat
body
his
long
ungainly
arms
his
pale
face
with
its
little
wisp
of
beard
would
have
been
recognized
by
oliva
cresswell
for
this
was
professor
heyler
the
herr
professor
as
beale
called
him
the
man
sitting
opposite
was
cast
in
a
different
mould
he
was
tall
spare
almost
æsthetic
the
face
the
nose
and
chin
hinted
at
a
refinement
which
his
shabby
threadbare
suit
and
his
collarless
shirt
freakishly
accentuated
now
and
again
he
would
raise
his
eyes
from
the
book
he
was
reading
survey
the
absorbed
professor
with
a
speculative
glance
and
then
return
to
his
reading
they
had
sat
in
silence
for
the
greater
part
of
an
hour
when
tap
on
the
door
brought
the
reader
round
with
narrow
eyes
expecting
a
visitor
professor
he
asked
in
german
nein
nein
rambled
the
old
man
who
shall
visit
me
ah
yes
he
tapped
his
fat
forefinger
i
remember
the
fräulein
was
to
call
he
got
up
and
shuffling
to
the
door
slipped
back
the
bolt
and
turned
it
his
face
fell
when
he
saw
beale
and
the
man
at
the
table
rose
hope
i
am
not
disturbing
you
said
the
detective
i
thought
you
lived
alone
he
too
spoke
in
the
language
which
the
professor
understood
best
that
is
a
friend
of
mine
said
old
heyler
uncomfortably
we
live
together
i
did
not
think
you
knew
my
address
introduce
me
said
the
man
at
the
table
coolly
the
old
professor
looked
dubiously
from
one
to
the
other
it
is
my
friend
herr
homo
herr
homo
repeated
beale
offering
his
hand
my
name
is
beale
homo
shot
a
keen
glance
at
him
a
split
or
my
criminal
instincts
fail
me
he
said
pleasantly
enough
split
repeated
beale
puzzled
american
i
gather
from
your
accent
said
homo
pray
sit
down
is
the
phrase
employed
by
the
criminal
classes
to
describe
a
gentleman
who
in
your
country
is
known
as
a
cop
oh
a
detective
smiled
beale
no
in
the
sense
you
mean
i
am
not
a
detective
at
any
rate
i
have
not
come
on
business
so
i
gather
said
the
other
seating
himself
or
you
would
have
brought
one
of
the
fellows
with
you
here
again
you
must
pardon
the
slang
but
we
call
the
detective
the
fellow
to
distinguish
him
from
the
who
is
the
regular
cop
unless
you
should
be
under
any
misapprehension
beale
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
i
am
a
representative
of
the
criminal
classes
a
fact
which
our
learned
friend
he
nodded
toward
the
distressed
professor
never
ceases
to
deplore
and
he
smiled
blandly
they
had
dropped
into
english
and
the
professor
after
waiting
uncomfortably
for
the
visitor
to
explain
his
business
had
dropped
back
to
his
work
with
a
grunt
i
am
parson
homo
and
this
is
my
we
professional
criminals
must
have
somewhere
to
go
when
we
are
not
in
prison
you
know
the
voice
was
that
of
an
educated
man
its
modulation
the
confidence
and
the
perfect
poise
of
the
speaker
suggested
the
college
man
so
that
you
shall
not
be
shocked
by
revelations
i
must
tell
you
that
i
have
just
come
out
of
prison
i
am
by
way
of
being
a
professional
burglar
i
am
not
easily
shocked
said
beale
he
glanced
at
the
professor
i
see
said
parson
homo
rising
that
i
am
unfortunately
i
can
not
go
into
the
street
without
risking
arrest
in
this
country
you
know
there
is
a
law
which
is
called
the
prevention
of
crimes
act
which
empowers
the
unemployed
members
of
the
constabulary
who
find
time
hanging
on
their
hands
to
arrest
known
criminals
on
suspicion
if
they
are
seen
out
in
questionable
circumstances
and
as
all
circumstances
are
questionable
to
the
unimaginative
and
his
no
less
obtuse
friend
the
i
will
retire
to
the
bedroom
and
stuff
my
ears
with
you
need
smiled
beale
i
guess
the
professor
has
many
secrets
from
you
go
on
guessing
my
ingenious
friend
said
the
parson
smiling
with
his
eyes
my
own
secrets
i
am
willing
to
reveal
but
he
waved
his
hand
and
passed
behind
the
cretonne
curtain
and
the
old
man
looked
up
from
his
instrument
it
is
the
donovan
leichmann
body
that
i
search
for
he
said
solemnly
there
was
a
case
of
at
the
docks
and
the
herr
professor
of
the
tropical
school
so
kindly
let
me
have
a
little
blood
for
testing
professor
said
beale
sitting
down
in
the
place
which
parson
homo
had
vacated
and
leaning
across
the
table
are
you
still
working
for
van
heerden
the
old
man
rolled
his
big
head
from
side
to
side
in
an
agony
of
protest
of
the
learned
doctor
i
do
not
want
to
speak
he
said
to
me
he
has
been
most
kind
consider
herr
peale
i
was
starving
in
this
country
which
hates
germans
and
regard
as
a
mad
old
fool
and
an
ugly
old
devil
and
none
helped
me
until
the
learned
doctor
discovered
me
i
am
a
german
yes
yet
i
have
no
nationality
being
absorbed
in
the
larger
brotherhood
of
science
as
for
me
i
am
indifferent
whether
the
kaiser
or
the
socialists
live
in
potsdam
but
i
am
loyal
herr
peale
to
all
who
help
me
to
you
also
he
said
hastily
for
you
have
been
most
kind
and
once
when
in
foolishness
i
went
into
a
room
where
i
ought
not
to
have
been
you
saved
me
from
the
police
he
shrugged
his
massive
shoulders
again
i
am
grateful
but
must
i
not
also
be
grateful
to
the
learned
doctor
tell
me
this
professor
said
beale
where
can
i
find
the
learned
doctor
at
his
laboratory
where
else
asked
the
professor
where
else
repeated
beale
the
old
man
was
silent
it
is
forbidden
that
i
should
speak
he
said
the
herr
doctor
is
engaged
in
a
great
experiment
which
will
bring
him
fortune
if
i
betray
his
secrets
he
may
be
ruined
such
ingratitude
herr
peale
there
was
a
silence
the
old
professor
obviously
distressed
and
ill
at
ease
looking
anxiously
at
the
younger
man
suppose
i
tell
you
that
the
herr
doctor
is
engaged
in
a
dangerous
conspiracy
said
beale
and
that
you
yourself
are
running
a
considerable
risk
by
assisting
him
the
big
hands
were
outspread
in
despair
the
herr
doctor
has
many
enemies
mumbled
heyler
i
can
tell
you
nothing
herr
peale
tell
me
this
said
beale
is
there
any
place
you
know
of
where
the
doctor
may
have
taken
a
lady
the
young
lady
into
whose
room
you
went
the
night
i
found
you
a
young
lady
the
old
man
was
obviously
surprised
no
no
herr
peale
there
is
no
place
where
a
young
lady
could
go
ach
no
well
said
beale
after
a
pause
i
guess
i
can
do
no
more
with
you
professor
he
glanced
round
at
the
cretonne
recess
i
inconvenience
you
any
longer
mr
homo
the
curtains
were
pushed
aside
and
the
man
stepped
out
the
on
his
thin
lips
i
fear
you
have
had
a
disappointing
visit
he
said
pleasantly
and
it
is
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
to
ask
me
if
i
can
help
you
i
will
save
you
the
trouble
of
asking
i
ca
beale
laughed
you
are
a
bad
he
said
i
had
no
intention
of
asking
you
he
nodded
to
the
old
man
and
with
another
nod
to
his
companion
was
turning
when
a
rap
came
at
the
door
he
saw
the
two
men
exchange
glances
and
noted
in
the
face
of
the
professor
a
look
of
blank
dismay
the
knock
was
repeated
impatiently
permit
me
said
beale
and
stepped
to
the
door
wait
wait
stammered
the
professor
if
peale
will
permit
he
shuffled
forward
but
beale
had
turned
the
latch
and
opened
the
door
wide
standing
in
the
entrance
was
a
girl
whom
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
as
hilda
glaum
sometime
desk
companion
of
oliva
cresswell
his
back
was
to
the
light
and
she
did
not
recognize
him
why
did
you
not
open
more
quickly
she
asked
in
german
and
swung
the
heavy
bag
she
carried
into
the
room
every
moment
i
thought
i
should
be
intercepted
here
is
the
bag
it
will
be
called
for
it
was
then
that
she
saw
beale
for
the
first
time
and
her
face
went
white
who
who
are
you
she
asked
then
quickly
i
know
you
you
are
the
man
beale
the
drunken
man
she
looked
from
him
to
the
bag
at
her
feet
and
to
him
again
then
before
he
could
divine
her
intention
she
had
stooped
and
grasped
the
handle
of
the
bag
instantly
all
his
attention
was
riveted
upon
that
leather
case
and
its
secret
his
hand
shot
out
and
gripped
her
arm
but
she
wrenched
herself
free
in
doing
so
the
bag
was
carried
by
the
momentum
of
its
release
and
was
driven
heavily
against
the
wall
he
heard
a
shivering
crash
as
though
a
hundred
little
glasses
had
broken
simultaneously
before
he
could
reach
the
bag
she
snatched
it
up
leapt
through
the
open
door
and
slammed
it
to
behind
her
his
hand
was
on
the
latch
put
up
beale
put
up
said
a
voice
behind
him
right
above
your
head
beale
where
we
can
see
them
he
turned
slowly
his
hands
rising
mechanically
to
face
parson
homo
who
still
sat
at
the
table
but
he
had
discarded
his
greek
book
and
was
handling
a
revolver
the
muzzle
of
which
covered
the
detective
smells
rotten
does
it
said
homo
pleasantly
beale
too
had
sniffed
the
musty
odour
and
knew
that
it
came
from
the
bag
the
girl
had
wrenched
from
his
grasp
it
was
the
sickly
scent
of
the
green
rust
chapter
xiii
at
deans
folly
with
her
elbows
resting
on
the
broad
and
her
cheeks
against
the
cold
steel
bars
which
covered
the
window
oliva
cresswell
watched
the
mists
slowly
dissipate
in
the
gentle
warmth
of
the
morning
sun
she
had
spent
the
night
dozing
in
a
and
at
the
first
light
of
day
she
had
bathed
and
redressed
ready
for
any
emergency
she
had
not
heard
any
sound
during
the
night
and
she
guessed
that
van
heerden
had
returned
to
london
the
room
in
which
she
was
imprisoned
was
on
the
first
floor
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
the
view
she
had
of
the
grounds
was
restricted
to
a
glimpse
between
two
big
lilac
bushes
which
were
planted
almost
on
a
level
with
her
room
the
house
had
been
built
on
the
slope
of
a
gentle
rise
so
that
you
might
walk
from
the
window
on
to
the
grassy
lawn
at
the
back
of
the
house
but
for
two
important
obstacles
the
first
being
represented
by
the
bars
which
protected
the
window
and
the
second
by
a
deep
area
which
formed
a
trench
too
wide
to
jump
she
could
see
however
that
the
grounds
were
extensive
the
high
wall
which
apparently
separated
the
garden
from
the
road
was
a
hundred
yards
away
she
knew
it
must
be
the
road
because
of
a
little
brown
gate
which
from
time
to
time
she
saw
between
the
swaying
bushes
she
turned
wearily
from
the
window
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
she
was
not
afraid
irritated
would
be
a
better
word
to
describe
her
emotion
she
was
mystified
too
and
that
was
an
added
irritation
why
should
this
man
van
heerden
who
admittedly
did
not
love
her
who
indeed
loved
her
so
little
that
he
could
strike
her
and
show
no
signs
of
remorse
why
did
this
man
want
to
marry
her
if
he
wanted
to
marry
her
why
did
he
kidnap
her
there
was
another
question
too
which
she
had
debated
that
night
why
did
his
reference
to
the
american
detective
beale
so
greatly
embarrass
her
she
had
reached
the
point
where
even
such
tremendous
subjects
of
debate
had
become
less
interesting
than
the
answer
to
that
question
which
was
furnished
when
a
knock
came
to
her
door
and
a
gruff
voice
said
breakfast
she
unlocked
the
door
and
pulled
it
open
the
man
called
gregory
was
standing
on
the
landing
he
jerked
his
thumb
to
the
room
opposite
you
can
use
both
these
rooms
he
said
but
you
ca
come
downstairs
i
have
put
your
breakfast
in
there
she
followed
the
thumb
across
the
landing
and
found
herself
in
a
plainly
furnished
the
table
had
been
laid
with
a
respectable
breakfast
and
until
she
had
appeased
her
healthy
young
appetite
she
took
very
little
stock
of
her
surroundings
the
man
came
up
in
half
an
hour
to
clear
away
the
table
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
where
i
am
asked
oliva
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
anything
said
gregory
i
suppose
you
know
that
by
detaining
me
here
you
are
committing
a
very
serious
crime
tell
it
to
the
doctor
said
the
man
with
a
queer
little
smile
she
followed
him
out
to
the
landing
she
wanted
to
see
what
sort
of
guard
was
kept
and
what
possibilities
there
were
of
escape
somehow
it
seemed
easier
to
make
a
reconnaissance
now
under
his
very
eyes
than
it
had
been
in
the
night
when
in
every
shadow
had
lurked
a
menace
she
did
not
follow
him
far
however
he
put
down
the
tray
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
reaching
out
both
his
hands
drew
two
sliding
doors
from
the
wall
and
snapped
them
in
her
face
she
heard
the
click
of
a
door
and
knew
that
any
chance
of
escape
from
this
direction
was
hopeless
the
doors
had
slid
noiselessly
on
their
oiled
runners
and
had
formed
for
her
a
little
lobby
of
the
landing
she
guessed
that
the
sliding
doors
had
been
closed
after
van
heerden
departure
she
had
exhausted
all
the
possibilities
of
her
bedroom
and
now
began
an
inspection
of
the
other
like
its
fellow
the
windows
were
barred
there
was
a
bookshelf
crowded
with
old
volumes
mostly
on
matters
ecclesiastical
or
theological
she
looked
at
it
thoughtfully
now
if
i
were
clever
like
beale
she
said
aloud
i
could
deduce
quite
a
lot
from
this
room
a
distant
church
bell
began
to
clang
and
she
realized
with
a
start
that
the
day
was
sunday
she
looked
at
her
watch
and
was
amazed
to
see
it
was
nearly
eleven
she
must
have
slept
longer
than
she
had
thought
this
window
afforded
her
no
better
view
than
did
that
of
the
bedroom
except
that
she
could
see
the
gate
more
plainly
and
what
looked
to
be
the
end
of
a
brick
building
which
had
been
erected
against
the
wall
she
craned
her
neck
looking
left
and
right
but
the
bushes
had
been
carefully
planted
to
give
the
previous
occupants
of
these
two
rooms
greater
privacy
presently
the
bell
stopped
and
she
addressed
herself
again
to
an
examination
of
the
room
in
an
sloping
desk
she
found
a
few
sheets
of
paper
a
pen
and
a
bottle
with
thick
ink
there
were
also
two
telegraph
forms
and
these
gave
her
an
idea
she
went
back
to
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
paper
before
her
she
began
to
note
the
contents
of
the
apartment
i
am
trying
to
be
bealish
she
admitted
she
might
also
have
confessed
that
she
was
trying
to
keep
her
mind
off
her
possibly
perilous
position
and
that
though
she
was
not
afraid
she
had
a
fear
of
fear
a
case
full
of
very
dull
good
books
that
means
that
the
person
who
lived
here
before
was
very
she
walked
over
and
examined
the
titles
pulled
out
a
few
books
and
looked
at
their
title
pages
they
all
bore
the
same
name
b
stringer
she
uttered
an
exclamation
was
there
some
directory
of
clergymen
names
she
was
sure
this
was
a
clergyman
nobody
else
would
have
a
library
of
such
weighty
volumes
her
fingers
ran
along
the
shelves
and
presently
she
found
what
she
wanted
crocker
clergy
list
of
she
opened
the
book
and
presently
found
stringer
laurence
thomas
benjamin
vicar
of
upper
staines
deans
folly
upper
reach
village
near
staines
her
eyes
sparkled
instinctively
she
knew
that
she
had
located
her
prison
van
heerden
had
certainly
hired
the
house
furnished
probably
from
the
clergyman
or
his
widow
she
began
to
search
the
room
with
feverish
haste
near
the
window
was
a
cupboard
built
out
she
opened
it
and
found
that
it
was
a
small
service
lift
apparently
communicating
with
the
kitchen
in
a
corner
of
the
room
was
an
invalid
chair
on
wheels
she
sat
down
at
the
table
and
reconstructed
the
character
of
its
occupant
she
saw
an
invalid
clergyman
who
had
lived
permanently
in
this
part
of
the
house
he
was
probably
wheeled
from
his
bedroom
to
his
and
in
this
cheerless
chamber
had
spent
the
last
years
of
his
life
and
this
place
was
deans
folly
she
took
up
the
telegraph
form
and
after
a
few
minutes
deliberation
wrote
to
beale
krooman
mansions
she
scratched
that
out
remembering
that
he
had
a
telegraphic
address
and
substituted
belocity
london
she
thought
a
moment
then
wrote

that
looked
too
bold
and
she
added
cresswell
she
took
a
florin
from
her
bag
and
wrapped
it
up
in
the
telegraph
form
she
had
no
exact
idea
as
to
how
she
should
get
the
message
sent
to
the
telegraph
office
and
it
was
sunday
when
all
telegraph
offices
would
be
closed
nor
was
there
any
immediate
prospect
of
her
finding
a
messenger
she
supposed
that
tradesmen
came
to
the
house
and
that
the
kitchen
door
was
somewhere
under
her
window
but
tradesmen
do
not
call
on
sundays
she
held
the
little
package
irresolutely
in
her
hand
she
must
take
her
chance
would
be
monday
and
it
was
certain
somebody
would
call
with
this
assurance
she
tucked
the
message
into
her
blouse
she
was
in
no
mood
to
continue
her
inspection
of
the
room
and
it
was
only
because
in
looking
again
from
the
window
she
pulled
it
from
its
hook
that
she
saw
the
instrument
which
hung
between
the
window
and
the
service
lift
she
picked
it
up
a
thing
it
consisted
of
a
short
vulcanite
handle
from
which
extended
two
flat
steel
supports
terminating
in
vulcanite
the
handle
was
connected
by
a
green
cord
with
a
plug
in
the
wall
oliva
recognized
it
it
was
an
electrophone
one
of
those
instruments
by
which
people
can
listen
to
an
opera
a
theatrical
entertainment
or
a
sermon
of
course
it
was
a
church
it
was
a
very
common
practice
for
invalids
to
be
connected
up
with
their
favourite
pulpit
and
doubtless
the
rev
stringer
had
derived
considerable
comfort
from
this
invention
she
dusted
the
receiver
and
put
them
to
her
ears
she
heard
nothing
beneath
the
plug
was
a
little
switch
she
turned
this
over
and
instantly
her
ears
were
filled
with
a
strange
hollow
sound
the
sound
which
a
bad
gramophone
record
makes
then
she
realized
that
she
was
listening
to
a
congregation
singing
this
ceased
after
awhile
and
she
heard
a
cough
so
surprisingly
near
and
loud
that
she
started
of
course
the
transmitter
would
be
in
the
pulpit
she
thought
then
a
voice
spoke
clear
and
distinct
yet
with
that
drawl
which
is
the
peculiar
property
of
ministers
of
the
established
church
she
smiled
as
the
first
words
came
to
her
i
publish
the
banns
of
marriage
between
henry
colebrook
and
jane
maria
smith
both
of
this
parish
this
is
the
second
time
of
asking
a
pause
then
also
between
henry
victor
vanden
and
oliva
cresswell
prédeaux
both
of
this
parish
this
is
the
third
time
of
asking
if
any
of
you
know
cause
or
just
impediment
why
these
persons
should
not
be
joined
together
in
holy
matrimony
ye
are
to
declare
it
she
dropped
the
instrument
with
a
crash
and
stood
staring
down
at
it
she
had
been
listening
to
the
publication
of
her
own
vanden
was
van
heerden
oliva
cresswell
prédeaux
was
herself
the
strangeness
of
the
names
meant
nothing
she
guessed
rather
than
knew
that
the
false
name
would
not
be
any
insuperable
bar
to
the
ceremony
she
must
get
away
for
the
first
time
she
had
a
horrible
sense
of
being
trapped
and
for
a
few
seconds
she
must
have
lost
her
head
for
she
tugged
at
the
iron
bars
dashed
wildly
out
and
hammered
at
the
sliding
door
presently
her
reason
took
charge
she
heard
the
heavy
step
of
gregory
on
the
stairs
and
recovered
her
calm
by
the
time
he
had
unlocked
the
bar
and
pulled
the
doors
apart
what
do
you
want
he
asked
i
want
you
to
let
me
out
of
here
oh
is
that
all
he
said
sarcastically
and
for
the
second
time
that
day
slammed
the
door
in
her
face
she
waited
until
he
was
out
of
hearing
then
she
went
back
noiselessly
to
the
she
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
service
lift
and
tested
the
ropes
there
were
two
one
which
supported
the
lift
and
one
by
which
it
was
hauled
up
and
she
gathered
that
these
with
the
lift
itself
formed
an
endless
chain
gripping
both
ropes
firmly
she
crept
into
the
confined
space
of
the
cupboard
and
let
herself
down
hand
over
hand
she
had
about
twelve
feet
to
descend
before
she
reached
the
kitchen
entrance
of
the
elevator
she
squeezed
through
the
narrow
opening
and
found
herself
in
a
kitchen
it
was
empty
a
small
fire
glowed
in
the
grate
her
own
tray
with
all
the
crockery
unwashed
was
on
the
dresser
and
there
were
the
remnants
of
a
meal
at
one
end
of
the
plain
table
she
tiptoed
across
the
kitchen
to
the
door
it
was
bolted
top
and
bottom
and
locked
fortunately
the
key
was
in
the
lock
and
in
two
minutes
she
was
outside
in
a
small
courtyard
beneath
the
level
of
the
ground
one
end
of
the
courtyard
led
past
another
window
and
that
she
could
not
risk
to
her
right
was
a
flight
of
stone
steps
and
that
was
obviously
the
safer
way
she
found
herself
in
a
little
park
which
fortunately
for
her
was
plentifully
sprinkled
with
clumps
of
rhododendrons
and
she
crept
from
bush
to
bush
taking
care
to
keep
out
of
sight
of
the
house
she
had
the
telegram
and
the
money
in
her
hand
and
her
first
object
was
to
get
this
outside
it
took
her
twenty
minutes
to
reach
the
wall
it
was
too
high
to
scale
and
there
was
no
sign
of
a
ladder
the
only
way
out
was
the
little
brown
door
she
had
seen
from
her
bedroom
window
and
cautiously
she
made
her
way
back
flitting
from
bush
to
bush
until
she
came
to
the
place
where
a
clear
view
of
the
door
and
the
building
to
its
left
could
be
obtained
the
shed
she
had
seen
was
much
longer
than
she
had
expected
and
evidently
had
recently
been
built
its
black
face
was
punctured
at
intervals
with
square
windows
and
a
roughly
painted
door
to
the
left
of
the
brown
garden
gate
was
the
only
entrance
she
could
see
she
looked
for
a
key
but
without
hope
of
finding
one
she
must
take
her
chance
she
thought
and
a
quick
run
brought
her
from
the
cover
of
the
bushes
to
the
brown
portal
which
stood
between
her
and
liberty
with
trembling
hands
she
slid
back
the
bolts
and
turned
the
handle
her
heart
leapt
as
it
gave
a
little
evidently
it
had
not
been
used
for
years
and
she
found
it
was
only
held
fast
by
the
gravel
which
had
accumulated
beneath
it
eagerly
she
scraped
the
gravel
aside
with
her
foot
and
her
hand
was
on
the
knob
when
she
heard
a
muffled
voice
behind
her
she
turned
and
then
with
a
gasp
of
horror
fell
back
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
shed
was
a
thing
which
was
neither
man
nor
beast
it
was
covered
in
a
wrap
which
had
once
been
white
but
was
now
dappled
with
green
the
face
and
head
were
covered
with
rubber
two
green
staring
eyes
surveyed
her
and
a
great
nose
was
uplifted
as
in
amazement
she
was
paralysed
for
a
moment
for
the
beastliness
of
the
figure
was
appalling
then
realizing
that
it
was
merely
a
man
whose
face
was
hidden
by
a
hideous
mask
she
sprang
again
for
the
door
but
a
hand
gripped
her
arm
and
pulled
her
back
she
heard
a
cheerful
whistle
from
the
road
without
and
remembering
the
package
in
her
hand
she
flung
it
high
over
the
wall
and
heard
its
soft
thud
and
the
whistle
stop
then
as
the
hideous
figure
slipped
his
arm
about
her
and
pressed
a
musty
hand
over
her
mouth
she
fainted
chapter

beale
suggests
marriage
held
up
by
a
gunman
asked
james
kitson
incredulously
why
what
do
you
mean
it
does
sound
right
does
it
smiled
beale
especially
after
mcnorton
telling
us
the
other
day
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
gunman
in
england
do
you
remember
his
long
dissertation
on
the
criminals
of
this
little
old
country
he
laughed
but
a
gunman
protested
kitson
by
the
way
have
you
had
breakfast
hours
ago
replied
beale
but
do
let
me
interrupt
you
james
kitson
pulled
his
chair
to
the
table
and
unfolded
his
napkin
it
was
almost
at
this
hour
that
oliva
cresswell
had
performed
a
similar
act
you
are
not
interrupting
me
said
kitson
go
on
beale
was
frowning
down
at
deserted
piccadilly
which
palatial
suite
at
the
overlooked
eh
he
said
absently
oh
yes
the
gunman
a
sure
enough
gunman
he
related
in
a
few
words
his
experience
of
the
previous
night
this
man
homo
said
kitson
is
he
one
of
the
gang
beale
shook
his
head
i
do
think
so
he
may
be
one
of
van
heerden
ambassadors
ambassadors
i
will
explain
van
heerden
game
one
of
these
days
and
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
said
beale
no
i
do
think
that
parson
homo
is
being
any
more
than
a
gentle
knight
succouring
a
distressed
lady
whether
for
love
of
the
lady
out
of
respect
for
the
professor
or
from
a
general
sense
of
antagonism
to
all
detectives
i
can
only
speculate
anyway
he
held
me
until
the
lady
was
out
of
hearing
and
presumably
out
of
sight
and
then
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
go
i
just
sat
down
and
talked
and
a
more
amiable
and
cultured
gentleman
it
would
be
impossible
to
meet
kitson
looked
at
his
companion
through
narrowed
lids
why
that
not
like
you
beale
he
said
i
thought
you
were
too
hot
on
the
scent
to
waste
time
so
i
am
said
the
other
thrusting
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
that
just
what
i
am
he
turned
suddenly
to
the
older
man
kitson
i
got
to
know
a
little
more
about
john
millinborn
will
than
i
know
at
present
the
lawyer
looked
up
fixed
his
glasses
and
regarded
the
younger
man
with
a
troubled
look
i
sorry
to
jump
in
on
you
like
this
but
i
rattled
i
understand
much
about
the
english
law
though
i
know
that
marriages
are
as
easy
to
make
here
in
london
as
they
are
in
our
country
but
here
as
everywhere
else
it
is
fairly
difficult
to
force
a
girl
into
marriage
against
her
will
and
the
marriage
of
course
is
not
good
in
law
he
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
a
couch
dangling
his
hat
between
his
legs
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
with
a
nervous
little
laugh
here
i
telling
you
all
that
i
came
to
ask
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
said
kitson
with
a
smile
everybody
in
england
rushes
to
tea
and
i
hope
i
shall
get
you
in
the
habit
beale
shook
his
head
you
are
right
about
the
marriage
kitson
went
on
but
i
give
you
the
law
on
the
subject
a
marriage
can
only
be
solemnized
if
due
notice
is
given
by
the
parties
who
must
be
resident
in
the
district
where
it
is
to
take
place
three
weeks
is
the
period
of
notice
is
there
no
other
way
yes
by
paying
special
fees
and
offering
a
good
and
sufficient
reason
a
faculty
can
be
secured
from
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
or
rather
from
his
officials
authorizing
a
marriage
without
notice
it
is
called
a
special
licence
and
the
marriage
may
occur
at
any
hour
and
at
any
place
is
there
a
register
of
applications
asked
beale
quickly
i
thought
of
that
nodded
the
lawyer
yes
i
keeping
that
side
under
observation
it
is
difficult
because
officialdom
is
as
obliging
as
it
might
be
my
own
view
is
that
van
heerden
will
be
married
in
the
ordinary
way
that
is
to
say
by
giving
notice
to
secure
his
special
licence
he
would
be
obliged
to
give
his
own
name
and
be
vouched
for
he
can
be
married
in
the
ordinary
way
even
if
he
gives
a
false
name
which
in
all
probability
he
will
would
the
marriage
be
legal
if
it
was
in
a
false
name
absolutely
in
english
law
you
may
commit
an
offence
by
marrying
in
a
wrong
name
but
it
would
not
invalidate
the
marriage
stanford
beale
sat
studying
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
is
there
any
chance
of
two
special
licences
being
issued
to
marry
the
same
girl
he
asked
none
why
do
you
ask
beale
did
not
reply
immediately
something
homo
said
last
night
when
i
told
him
frankly
that
i
was
searching
for
miss
cresswell
said
he
the
lady
marrying
the
doctor
he
would
tell
me
more
but
he
gave
me
an
idea
to
make
sure
that
no
special
licence
is
issued
to
van
heerden
i
shall
apply
for
one
myself
the
lawyer
stared
at
him
to
marry
the
girl
he
gasped
but
stanford
beale
laughed
a
little
bitterly
say
do
get
up
in
the
air
kitson
i
only
thinking
of
miss
cresswell
a
special
licence
in
my
name
would
stop
one
of
van
paths
to
easy
money
tell
me
and
this
is
what
i
came
to
ask
you
under
millinborn
will
does
the
husband
benefit
directly
by
the
marriage
or
is
he
dependent
upon
what
his
wife
gives
him
he
benefits
directly
said
kitson
after
a
pause
on
his
marriage
he
receives
exactly
of
the
girl
fortune
that
was
idea
the
husband
independent
he
said
not
put
him
in
the
humiliating
position
of
dependence
on
his
wife
generosity
and
there
will
be
a
chance
of
happiness
for
them
both
i
see
of
course
van
heerden
knows
that
he
has
only
to
produce
a
marriage
certificate
to
scoop
in
two
and
a
half
million
dollars
that
is
half
a
million
in
english
money
this
is
the
secret
of
it
all
he
wants
money
immediately
and
under
the
terms
of
the
will
he
gets
it
said
kitson
if
he
came
to
me
with
proof
of
his
marriage
even
if
i
knew
that
he
had
coerced
the
girl
into
marriage
i
must
give
him
his
share
van
heerden
was
pretty
thorough
when
he
put
my
dying
friend
through
his
examination
his
face
hardened
heavens
give
every
penny
i
had
in
the
world
to
bring
that
fiend
to
the
gallows
beale
his
voice
shook
and
rising
abruptly
he
walked
to
the
window
presently
he
turned
i
think
there
is
something
in
your
idea
get
the
licence
i
will
and
marry
her
said
beale
quickly
marry
her
i
do
quite
understand
you
for
the
first
time
there
was
suspicion
in
his
voice
kitson
i
going
to
put
all
my
cards
on
the
table
said
beale
quietly
will
you
sit
down
a
moment
there
are
certain
facts
which
we
can
not
ignore
fact
one
is
that
oliva
cresswell
is
in
the
hands
of
a
man
who
is
absolutely
unscrupulous
but
has
no
other
object
in
view
than
marriage
her
beauty
her
charm
all
the
attractive
qualities
which
appeal
to
most
men
and
to
all
brutes
have
no
appeal
for
him
to
him
she
is
just
a
money
proposition
if
he
ca
marry
her
she
has
no
further
interest
for
him
i
see
that
agreed
the
lawyer
but
wait
please
if
we
knew
where
she
was
we
could
stop
the
marriage
and
indict
van
heerden
but
i
an
idea
that
we
sha
locate
her
until
it
is
too
late
or
nearly
too
late
i
ca
go
hunting
with
a
pack
of
policemen
i
must
play
a
lone
hand
or
nearly
a
lone
hand
when
i
find
her
i
must
be
in
a
position
to
marry
her
without
losing
a
moment
you
mean
to
marry
her
to
foil
van
heerden
and
after
to
dissolve
the
marriage
asked
the
lawyer
shaking
his
head
i
do
like
that
solution
beale
i
tell
you
frankly
i
do
like
it
you
a
good
man
and
i
have
every
faith
in
you
but
if
i
consented
even
though
i
were
confident
that
you
would
play
fair
which
i
am
i
should
feel
that
i
had
betrayed
john
millinborn
trust
it
is
because
it
is
you
my
son
he
said
kindly
enough
but
if
you
were
the
archangel
gabriel
i
kick
at
that
plan
marriage
is
a
difficult
business
to
get
out
of
once
you
are
in
it
especially
in
this
country
beale
did
not
interrupt
the
older
man
right
and
now
if
you
finished
i
tell
you
my
scheme
he
said
as
i
see
it
there
only
a
ghost
of
a
chance
of
our
saving
this
girl
from
marriage
i
done
my
best
and
we
mcnorton
and
i
have
taken
all
the
facts
before
a
judge
this
morning
we
got
a
special
interview
with
the
idea
of
securing
a
warrant
for
van
heerden
arrest
but
there
is
no
evidence
to
convict
him
on
any
single
charge
we
can
not
connect
him
with
the
disappearance
of
miss
cresswell
and
although
i
pointed
out
that
van
heerden
admits
that
he
knows
where
the
girl
is
the
judge
said
fairly
i
thought
that
there
was
no
law
which
compelled
a
man
to
divulge
the
address
of
his
fiancée
to
one
who
was
a
possible
rival
the
girl
is
of
an
age
when
she
can
do
as
she
wishes
and
as
i
understand
the
matter
you
have
no
legal
status
as
a
guardian
none
said
james
kitson
that
is
our
weak
point
i
am
merely
the
custodian
of
her
money
officially
i
am
supposed
to
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
oliva
cresswell
is
oliva
prédeaux
the
heiress
therefore
our
hands
are
tied
concluded
beale
quietly
do
you
see
that
my
plan
is
the
only
one
but
i
have
told
you
what
it
is
a
man
a
criminal
this
parson
homo
who
can
help
i
am
satisfied
that
he
does
not
know
where
the
girl
is
but
he
help
for
a
consideration
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
pulled
again
i
am
seeing
him
this
afternoon
kitson
frowned
the
gunman
how
can
he
help
you
i
will
tell
you
this
man
as
i
say
is
known
to
the
police
as
parson
homo
apparently
he
is
an
unfrocked
priest
one
who
has
gone
under
he
still
preserves
the
resemblance
to
a
gentleman
he
spoke
slowly
and
deliberately
in
decent
clothes
he
would
look
like
a
parson
i
propose
that
he
shall
marry
me
to
miss
cresswell
the
marriage
will
be
a
fake
but
neither
the
girl
nor
van
heerden
will
know
this
if
my
surmise
is
right
when
van
heerden
finds
she
is
married
he
will
take
no
further
steps
except
perhaps
he
smiled
to
make
her
a
widow
sooner
or
later
we
are
bound
to
get
him
under
lock
and
key
and
then
we
can
tell
miss
cresswell
the
truth
in
other
words
you
intend
breaking
the
law
and
committing
a
serious
offence
said
kitson
shaking
his
head
i
ca
be
a
party
to
that
besides
she
may
not
marry
you
i
see
that
danger
van
heerden
is
a
mighty
clever
fellow
he
may
be
married
before
i
trace
them
you
say
that
homo
does
know
about
the
girl
what
does
he
know
he
has
heard
of
van
heerden
he
has
heard
probably
from
the
girl
hilda
glaum
that
van
heerden
is
getting
married
the
underworld
do
not
get
their
news
out
of
special
editions
he
probably
knows
too
that
van
heerden
is
engaged
in
some
swindle
which
is
outside
the
parson
line
of
business
will
he
help
you
sure
beale
said
with
quiet
confidence
the
man
is
broke
and
desperate
the
police
watch
him
like
a
cat
and
would
get
him
sooner
or
later
mcnorton
told
me
that
much
i
have
offered
him
passage
to
australia
and
and
he
is
ready
to
jump
at
it
you
have
explained
the
scheme
i
had
to
confessed
beale
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
to
my
surprise
he
did
like
it
it
appears
that
even
a
crook
has
scruples
and
even
when
i
told
him
the
whole
of
my
plan
he
still
like
it
but
eventually
agreed
he
has
gone
to
whitechapel
to
get
the
necessary
kit
i
am
putting
him
up
in
my
flat
of
course
it
may
not
be
necessary
he
went
on
but
somehow
i
think
it
will
be
kitson
spread
out
his
hands
in
despair
i
shall
have
to
consent
he
said
the
whole
thing
was
a
mistake
from
the
beginning
i
trust
you
stanford
he
went
on
looking
the
other
in
the
eye
you
have
no
feeling
beyond
an
ordinary
professional
interest
in
this
young
lady
beale
dropped
his
eyes
if
i
said
that
kitson
i
should
be
telling
a
lie
he
said
quietly
i
have
a
very
deep
interest
in
miss
cresswell
but
that
is
not
going
to
make
any
difference
to
me
and
she
will
never
know
he
left
soon
after
this
and
went
back
to
his
rooms
at
four
he
received
a
visitor
parson
homo
cleanly
shaved
and
attired
in
a
black
coat
and
white
choker
seemed
more
real
to
the
detective
than
the
parson
homo
he
had
met
on
the
previous
night
you
look
the
part
all
right
said
beale
i
suppose
i
do
said
the
other
shortly
what
am
i
to
do
next
you
stay
here
i
have
made
up
a
bed
for
you
in
my
study
said
beale
i
would
like
to
know
a
little
more
of
this
before
i
go
any
further
homo
said
there
are
many
reasons
why
i
want
information
i
have
told
you
the
story
said
beale
patiently
and
i
am
going
to
say
right
here
that
i
do
not
intend
telling
you
any
more
you
carry
this
thing
through
and
i
pay
you
what
i
agreed
nobody
will
be
injured
by
your
deception
that
i
promise
you
that
does
worry
me
so
much
said
the
other
coolly
as
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
an
agitated
hurried
knock
and
beale
immediately
answered
it
it
was
mcnorton
and
from
force
of
habit
parson
homo
drew
back
into
the
shadows
all
right
parson
said
mcnorton
i
knew
you
were
here
what
do
you
make
of
this
he
turned
to
beale
and
laid
on
the
table
a
piece
of
paper
which
had
been
badly
crumpled
and
which
he
now
smoothed
out
it
was
the
top
half
of
a
telegraph
form
the
lower
half
had
been
torn
away
belocity
london
beale
read
aloud
that
you
interrupted
mcnorton
and
the
other
nodded
belocity
london
he
read
slowly
imprisoned
at
deans
at
this
point
the
remainder
of
the
message
had
been
torn
off
chapter
xv
the
good
herr
stardt
where
is
the
rest
said
beale
that
the
lot
replied
mcnorton
grimly
it
the
only
information
you
will
get
from
this
source
for
hours
but
i
do
understand
it
is
undoubtedly
miss
handwriting
and
is
as
undoubtedly
your
telegraphic
address
this
paper
he
went
on
was
taken
from
a
drunken
tramp
you
call
you
where
at
said
mcnorton
the
man
was
picked
up
in
the
street
fighting
drunk
and
taken
to
the
police
station
where
he
developed
delirium
tremens
apparently
he
has
been
on
the
jag
all
the
week
and
booze
finished
him
off
the
local
inspector
in
searching
him
found
this
piece
of
paper
in
his
pocket
and
connected
it
with
the
disappearance
of
miss
cresswell
the
matter
being
fresh
in
his
mind
as
only
this
morning
we
had
circulated
a
new
description
throughout
the
home
counties
he
got
me
on
the
and
sent
a
constable
up
to
town
with
the
paper
this
afternoon
h
said
beale
biting
his
lips
thoughtfully
she
evidently
gave
the
man
the
telegram
telling
him
to
dispatch
it
she
probably
gave
him
money
too
which
was
the
explanation
of
his
final
drunk
i
do
think
that
is
the
case
said
mcnorton
he
had
one
lucid
moment
at
the
station
when
he
was
as
to
where
he
got
the
money
to
get
drunk
and
he
affirmed
that
he
found
it
wrapped
up
in
a
piece
of
paper
that
sounds
true
to
me
she
either
dropped
it
from
a
car
or
threw
it
from
a
house
is
the
man
very
ill
pretty
bad
said
the
other
you
will
get
nothing
out
of
him
before
the
morning
the
doctors
had
to
dope
him
to
get
him
quiet
and
he
will
be
some
time
before
he
is
right
he
looked
up
at
the
other
occupant
of
the
room
well
parson
you
are
helping
beale
i
understand
yes
said
the
other
easily
returning
to
your
old
profession
i
see
said
mcnorton
parson
homo
drew
himself
up
a
little
stiffly
if
you
have
anything
against
me
you
can
pull
me
for
it
he
said
insolently
that
your
business
as
to
the
profession
i
followed
before
i
started
on
that
career
of
crime
which
brought
me
into
contact
with
the
crude
representatives
of
what
is
amusingly
called
law
is
entirely
my
affair
do
get
your
wool
off
parson
said
the
other
you
have
lost
your
sense
of
humour
that
where
you
are
wrong
said
homo
coolly
i
have
merely
lost
my
sense
of
decency
mcnorton
turned
to
the
other
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
am
imprisoned
at
deans
repeated
beale
what
have
you
in
this
country
there
are
a
dozen
of
them
replied
the
police
chief
deansgate
in
manchester
deanston
in
perth
deansboro
deans
abbey
i
been
looking
them
up
there
is
a
whole
crowd
of
them
are
there
any
near
kingston
none
replied
the
other
then
it
is
obviously
the
name
of
a
house
said
beale
i
have
noticed
that
in
england
you
are
in
the
habit
of
naming
rather
than
numbering
your
houses
especially
in
the
suburbs
he
looked
across
to
parson
homo
can
you
help
the
man
shook
his
head
if
i
were
a
vulgar
burglar
i
might
assist
you
he
said
but
my
branch
of
the
profession
does
not
take
me
to
the
suburbs
we
will
get
a
kingston
directory
and
go
through
it
said
mcnorton
we
have
one
on
the
file
at
scotland
yard
if
beale
suddenly
raised
his
hand
to
enjoin
silence
he
had
heard
a
familiar
step
in
the
corridor
outside
that
van
heerden
he
said
in
a
low
voice
he
has
been
out
all
the
morning
has
he
been
shadowed
asked
mcnorton
in
the
same
tone
my
man
lost
him
he
said
he
tiptoed
along
the
passage
and
stood
listening
behind
the
door
presently
he
heard
the
doctor
door
close
and
came
back
i
have
had
the
best
sleuth
in
america
trailing
him
he
said
and
he
has
slipped
him
every
time
anyway
said
mcnorton
this
telegram
disposes
of
the
idea
that
she
has
gone
to
liverpool
it
also
settles
the
question
as
to
whether
she
went
of
her
own
free
will
if
his
name
were
on
that
telegram
he
said
thoughtfully
i
would
take
a
risk
and
pull
him
in
i
will
give
you
something
bigger
to
pull
him
for
beale
said
once
i
have
placed
miss
cresswell
in
safety
the
green
rust
smiled
the
police
chief
the
green
rust
said
beale
but
he
did
not
smile
that
van
heerden
big
game
the
abduction
of
miss
cresswell
is
merely
a
means
to
an
end
he
wants
her
money
and
may
want
it
very
badly
the
more
urgent
is
his
need
the
sooner
that
marriage
takes
place
but
there
is
no
clergyman
in
england
who
would
marry
them
it
was
homo
who
interrupted
my
dear
friend
that
sort
of
thing
is
not
done
except
in
story
books
if
the
woman
refuses
her
consent
the
marriage
can
not
possibly
occur
as
i
understand
the
lady
is
not
likely
to
be
cowed
that
is
what
i
am
afraid
of
said
beale
she
is
all
pluck
he
stopped
for
he
had
heard
the
doctor
door
close
in
three
strides
he
had
crossed
the
hallway
and
was
in
the
corridor
confronting
his
suave
neighbour
van
heerden
carefully
attired
was
pulling
on
his
gloves
and
smiled
into
the
stern
face
of
his
rival
well
he
asked
pleasantly
any
news
of
miss
cresswell
if
i
had
any
news
of
miss
cresswell
you
would
not
be
here
said
beale
but
how
interesting
drawled
the
doctor
where
should
i
be
you
would
be
under
lock
and
key
my
friend
said
beale
the
doctor
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
softly
what
a
lover
he
said
and
how
reluctant
to
accept
his
dismissal
it
may
ease
your
mind
to
know
that
miss
cresswell
whom
i
hope
very
soon
to
call
van
heerden
is
perfectly
happy
and
is
very
annoyed
at
your
persistence
i
had
a
telegram
from
her
this
morning
begging
me
to
come
to
liverpool
at
the
earliest
opportunity
that
a
lie
said
beale
quietly
but
one
lie
more
or
less
i
suppose
does
count
a
thoroughly
immoral
view
to
take
said
the
doctor
with
much
severity
but
i
see
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
arguing
with
you
and
i
can
only
make
one
request
beale
said
nothing
but
stood
waiting
it
is
this
said
the
doctor
choosing
his
words
with
great
care
that
you
call
off
the
gentleman
who
has
been
dogging
my
footsteps
it
was
amusing
at
first
but
now
it
is
becoming
annoying
some
of
my
patients
have
complained
of
this
man
watching
their
houses
you
not
seen
a
patient
van
heerden
said
beale
and
anyway
i
guess
you
had
better
get
used
to
being
shadowed
it
is
your
first
experience
the
doctor
looked
at
him
under
lowered
lids
and
smiled
again
i
could
save
your
man
a
great
deal
of
trouble
he
said
and
myself
considerable
exertion
by
giving
him
a
list
of
the
places
where
i
intend
calling
he
will
find
that
out
for
himself
said
beale
i
wish
him
greater
success
than
he
has
had
replied
the
other
and
passed
on
descending
the
stairs
slowly
beale
went
back
to
his
flat
passed
to
his
bedroom
and
looked
down
into
the
street
he
made
a
signal
to
a
man
at
the
corner
and
received
an
almost
imperceptible
answer
then
he
returned
to
the
two
men
this
fellow
is
too
clever
for
us
i
am
afraid
and
london
with
its
tubes
its
underground
stations
and
is
a
pretty
difficult
proposition
i
suppose
your
man
lost
him
in
the
tube
said
mcnorton
there
are
two
ways
down
the
elevator
and
the
stairs
and
it
is
mighty
difficult
to
follow
a
man
unless
you
know
which
way
he
is
going
but
you
were
interrupted
at
an
interesting
moment
what
are
you
going
to
tell
us
about
the
green
rust
i
can
only
tell
you
this
said
beale
that
the
green
rust
is
the
greatest
conspiracy
against
the
civilized
world
that
has
ever
been
hatched
he
looked
sharply
at
homo
do
look
at
me
said
the
parson
i
know
nothing
about
it
unless
he
stopped
and
frowned
the
green
rust
he
repeated
is
that
old
man
heyler
secret
he
in
it
said
beale
shortly
is
it
a
swindle
of
some
kind
asked
the
parson
curiously
it
never
struck
me
that
heyler
was
that
kind
of
man
there
is
no
swindle
in
it
so
far
as
heyler
concerned
said
beale
it
is
something
bigger
than
a
swindle
a
telephone
bell
rang
and
he
took
up
the
receiver
and
listened
only
interjecting
a
query
or
two
then
he
hung
up
the
instrument
it
is
as
i
thought
he
said
the
doctor
slipped
again
had
a
car
waiting
for
him
in
oxford
street
and
when
he
saw
there
were
no
about
jumped
in
and
was
driven
eastward
did
you
get
the
number
of
the
car
asked
mcnorton
beale
smiled
that
not
much
use
he
said
he
probably
got
two
or
three
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
go
along
to
kingston
he
said
i
sha
be
able
to
come
with
you
said
mcnorton
i
have
a
meeting
with
the
commissioner
at
five
before
you
go
remarked
beale
you
might
put
your
signature
to
this
declaration
of
my
he
laid
on
the
table
a
blue
foolscap
blank
what
this
asked
the
surprised
mcnorton
an
application
for
a
special
licence
are
you
going
to
be
married
i
hope
so
said
the
other
cautiously
you
do
seem
very
cheerful
about
it
i
presume
you
want
me
to
testify
to
the
urgency
of
the
case
i
am
probably
perjuring

he
signed
his

with
a
flourish
when

the

circumstances

brought
to
your

mcnorton
said
the
detective
for
the
present
it
is
necessary
to
keep
my
plan
a
secret
has
it
anything
to
do
with
the
green
rust
asked
the
other
jokingly
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
green
rust
well

get
along
said
mcnorton
i
will
telephone
the
kingston
police
to
give

all
the
assistance
possible
but
i
am
afraid
you
will
learn
nothing
from
the
tramp
till
the
morning
and
perhaps
not
then
he
took
his
leave
soon
after
now
homo
it
is
up
to
you
and
me
said
beale

will
have
to
keep
close
to
me
after

yourself
at
home
here
until
i
come
back
one
moment
said
homo
as
beale
rose
and
gathered
up
his
hat
and
gloves
to
depart
before
you
go
i
want
you
to
understand
clearly
that
i
am
taking
on
this
job
because
it
offers
me
a
chance
that
i
have
had
since
i
fell
from
grace
if
you
will
excuse
the
that
i
understand
said
beale
i
may
be
doing
you
a
very
bad
turn
i
take
that
risk

beale
on
your
own
head

said

his
hard
face
creased
in
a
fleeting
smile
beale
car
was
waiting
but
his
departure
was
unexpectedly
delayed
as
he
passed
down
the
stairs
into
the
vestibule
he
saw
a
stranger
standing
near
the
door
reading
the
enamelled
affixed
to
the
wall
something
in
his
appearance
arrested
beale
the
man
was
well
dressed
in
the
sense
that
his
clothes
were
new
and
well
cut
but
the
pattern
of
the
cloth
no
less
than
the
startling
yellowness
of
the
boots
and
that
unmistakable
of
the
foreigner
the
shape
and
colour
of
the
cravat
stamped
him
as
being
neither
american
nor
british
can
i
be
of
any
assistance
asked
beale
are
you
looking
for
somebody
the
visitor
turned
a
pink
face
to
him
you
are
very
good
he
said
with
the
faint
trace
of
an
accent
i
understand
that
doctor
van
heerden
lives
here
yes
he
lives
here
said
beale
but
i
am
afraid
he
is
not
at
home
he
thought
it
might
be
a
patient
or
a
summons
to
a
patient
not
at
home
the
man
face
fell
but
how
unfortunate
could
you
tell
me
where
i
can
find
him
my
business
is
immediate
and
i
have
come
a
long
way
from
germany
guessed
beale
the
mail
train
was
due
at
charing
cross
half
an
hour
before
i
am
a
friend
of
doctor
van
heerden
and
possibly
i
can
assist
you
is
the
business
very
important
does
it
concern
he
hesitated
the
green
rust
he
spoke
the
last
sentence
in
german
and
the
man
started
and
looked
at
him
with
mingled
suspicion
and
uncertainty
it
is
a
matter
of
the
greatest
importance
he
repeated
it
is
of
vital
importance
he
spoke
in
german
about
the
green
rust
asked
beale
in
the
same
language
i
do
not
know
anything
of
the
green
rust
said
the
man
hurriedly
i
am
merely
the
bearer
of
a
communication
which
is
of
the
greatest
importance
he
repeated
the
words
the
greatest
importance
if
you
give
me
the
letter
said
beale
i
will
see
that
it
is
sent
on
to
him
and
he
held
out
his
hand
with
the
assurance
of
one
who
shared
the
dearest
secrets
of
the
doctor
the
stranger
hand
wandered
to
his
breast
pocket
but
came
back
empty
no
it
must
be
given
i
must
see
the
doctor
himself
he
said
he
does
not
expect
me
and
i
will
wait
beale
thought
quickly
well
perhaps
you
will
come
upstairs
to
my
flat
and
wait
he
said
genially
and
led
the
way
and
the
man
still
showing
evidence
of
uneasiness
was
ushered
into
his
room
where
the
sight
of
the
rev
parson
homo
tended
to
reassure
him
would
he
have
tea
he
would
not
have
tea
would
he
take
coffee
he
would
not
take
coffee
a
glass
of
wine
perhaps
no
he
did
not
drink
wine
nor
beer
nor
would
he
take
any
refreshment
whatever
my
man
thought
the
desperate
beale
i
either
chloroform
you
or
hit
you
on
the
head
with
the
poker
but
i
am
going
to
see
that
letter
as
if
divining
his
thought
but
placing
thereon
a
wrong
construction
the
man
said
i
should
avail
myself
of
your
kindness
to
deliver
my
letter
to
doctor
van
heerden
but
of
what
service
would
it
be
since
it
is
only
a
letter
introducing
me
to
the
good
doctor
oh
is
that
all
said
beale
disappointed
and
somehow
he
knew
the
man
spoke
the
truth
that
is
all
he
said
except
of
course
my
message
which
is
verbal
my
name
is
stardt
you
may
have
heard
the
doctor
speak
of
me
we
have
had
some
correspondence
yes
yes
i
remember
lied
beale
the
message
is
for
him
alone
of
course
as
you
will
understand
and
if
i
deliver
it
to
you
smiled
herr
stardt
you
should
not
understand
it
because
it
is

the
pawn
ticket
oliva
cresswell
awoke
to
consciousness
as
she
was
being
carried
up
the
stairs
of
the
house
she
may
have
recovered
sooner
for
she
retained
a
confused
impression
of
being
laid
down
amidst
waving
grasses
and
of
hearing
somebody
grunt
that
she
was
heavier
than
he
thought
also
she
remembered
as
dimly
the
presence
of
van
heerden
standing
over
her
and
he
was
wearing
a
long
grey
as
her
captor
kicked
open
the
door
of
her
room
she
scrambled
out
of
his
arms
and
leant
against
the
for
support
i
all
right
she
said
breathlessly
it
was
foolish
to
faint
but
but
you
frightened
me
the
man
grinned
and
seemed
about
to
speak
but
a
sharp
voice
from
the
landing
called
him
and
he
went
out
slamming
the
door
behind
him
she
crossed
to
the
bathed
her
face
in
cold
water
and
felt
better
though
she
was
still
a
little
giddy
then
she
sat
down
to
review
the
situation
and
in
that
review
two
figures
came
alternately
into
prominence
van
heerden
and
beale
she
was
an
eminently
sane
girl
she
had
had
the
beginnings
of
what
might
have
been
an
unusually
fine
education
had
it
not
been
interrupted
by
the
death
of
her
she
had
too
the
advantage
which
the
finished
young
lady
does
not
possess
of
having
grafted
to
the
wisdom
of
the
schools
the
sure
understanding
of
men
and
things
which
personal
contact
with
struggling
humanity
can
alone
give
to
us
the
great
problems
of
life
had
been
sprung
upon
her
with
all
their
hideous
realism
and
through
all
she
had
retained
her
poise
and
her
clear
vision
many
of
the
phenomena
represented
by
man
attitude
to
woman
she
could
understand
but
that
a
man
who
admittedly
did
not
love
her
and
had
no
other
apparent
desire
than
to
rid
himself
of
the
incubus
of
a
wife
as
soon
as
he
was
wed
should
wish
to
marry
her
was
incomprehensible
that
he
had
already
published
the
banns
of
her
marriage
left
her
gasping
at
his
audacity
strange
how
her
thoughts
leapt
all
the
events
of
the
morning
the
wild
rush
to
escape
the
struggle
with
the
hideously
masked
man
and
all
that
went
before
or
followed
and
went
back
to
the
night
before
somehow
she
knew
that
van
heerden
had
told
her
the
truth
and
that
there
was
behind
this
act
of
his
a
deeper
significance
than
she
could
grasp
she
remembered
what
he
had
said
about
beale
and
flushed
you
silly
matilda
she
said
to
herself
employing
the
term
of
address
which
she
reserved
for
moments
of
here
is
a
young
man
you
have
only
met
half
a
dozen
times
who
is
probably
a
very
nice
married
policeman
with
a
growing
family
and
you
are
going
hot
and
cold
at
the
suggestion
that
you
in
love
with
him
she
shook
her
head
reproachfully
and
yet
upon
beale
all
her
thoughts
were
centred
and
however
they
might
wander
it
was
to
beale
they
returned
she
could
analyse
that
buoyancy
which
had
asserted
itself
that
confidence
which
had
suddenly
become
a
mental
armour
which
repelled
every
terrifying
thought
to
this
faith
she
had
in
a
man
who
in
a
few
weeks
before
she
had
looked
upon
as
an
incorrigible
drunkard
she
had
time
for
thought
and
really
though
this
she
did
not
acknowledge
she
desperately
needed
the
occupation
of
that
thought
what
was
beale
business
why
did
he
employ
her
to
copy
out
this
list
of
american
and
canadian
statistics
why
did
he
want
to
know
all
these
hotels
their
proprietors
the
chief
of
the
police
and
the
like
she
wished
she
had
her
papers
and
books
so
that
she
might
go
on
extracting
that
interminable
list
what
would
van
heerden
do
now
would
her
attempted
escape
change
his
plans
how
would
he
overcome
the
difficulty
of
marrying
a
girl
who
was
certain
to
denounce
him
in
the
presence
of
so
independent
a
witness
as
a
clergyman
she
would
die
before
she
married
him
she
told
herself
she
could
not
rest
and
walked
about
the
room
examining
the
framed
prints
and
looking
at
the
books
and
occasionally
walking
to
the
glass
above
the
to
see
if
any
sign
was
left
of
the
red
mark
on
her
cheek
where
van
heerden
hand
had
fallen
this
exercise
gave
her
a
curious
satisfaction
and
when
she
saw
that
the
mark
had
subsided
and
was
blending
more
to
the
colour
of
her
skin
she
felt
disappointed
startled
she
analysed
this
curious
mental
attitude
and
again
came
to
beale
she
wanted
beale
to
see
the
place
she
wanted
beale
sympathy
she
wanted
beale
rage
she
was
sure
he
would
rage
she
laughed
to
herself
and
for
want
of
other
and
better
amusement
walked
to
the
drawers
in
the
and
examined
their
contents
they
were
empty
and
unlocked
save
one
which
refused
to
respond
to
her
tug
she
remembered
she
had
a
small
bunch
of
keys
in
her
bag
i
am
going
to
be
impertinent
forgive
the
liberty
she
said
as
she
felt
the
lock
give
to
the
first
attempt
she
pulled
the
drawer
open
it
contained
a
few
articles
of
feminine
attire
and
a
thick
black
leather
portfolio
she
lifted
this
out
laid
it
on
the
table
and
opened
it
it
was
filled
with
foolscap
written
on
the
cover
was
the
word
argentine
and
somehow
the
writing
was
familiar
to
her
it
was
a
bold
hand
obviously
feminine
where
have
i
seen
that
before
she
asked
and
knit
her
forehead
she
turned
the
first
leaf
and
read
alsigar
hotel
fournos
proprietor
miguel
porcorini
index
her
mouth
opened
in
astonishment
and
she
ran
down
the
list
she
took
out
another
folder
it
was
marked
canada
and
she
turned
the
leaves
rapidly
she
recognized
this
work
it
was
the
same
work
that
beale
had
given
to
her
a
list
of
the
hotels
their
proprietors
and
means
of
conveyance
but
there
was
no
reference
to
the
police
and
then
it
dawned
upon
her
an
unusually
long
description
produced
certain
characteristics
of
writing
which
she
recognized
hilda
glaum
she
said
i
wonder
what
this
means
she
examined
the
contents
of
the
drawer
again
and
some
of
them
puzzled
her
not
the
little
stack
of
handkerchiefs
the
folded
collars
and
the
like
if
hilda
glaum
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
deans
folly
and
used
this
room
it
was
natural
that
these
things
should
be
here
if
this
were
her
bureau
the
little
carton
of
nibs
and
the
spare
note
book
were
to
be
expected
it
was
the
steel
box
which
set
her
wondering
this
she
discovered
in
the
far
corner
of
the
drawer
if
she
could
have
imagined
anything
so
fantastic
she
might
have
believed
that
the
box
had
been
specially
made
to
hold
the
thing
it
contained
and
preserve
it
from
the
dangers
of
fire
the
lid
which
closed
with
a
spring
catch
released
by
the
pressure
of
a
tiny
button
was
perfectly
fitted
so
that
the
box
was
in
all
probability
she
opened
it
without
difficulty
the
sides
were
lined
with
what
seemed
to
be
at
first
sight
thick
cardboard
but
which
proved
on
closer
inspection
to
be
asbestos
she
opened
it
with
a
sense
of
eager
anticipation
but
her
face
fell
save
for
a
tiny
square
blue
envelope
at
the
bottom
the
box
was
empty
she
lifted
it
in
her
hand
to
shake
out
the
envelope
and
it
was
then
that
the
idea
occurred
to
her
that
the
box
had
been
made
for
the
envelope
which
refused
to
budge
until
she
lifted
one
end
with
a
hairpin
it
was
unsealed
and
she
slipped
in
her
finger
and
pulled
out
a
pawn
ticket
she
had
an
inclination
to
laugh
which
she
checked
she
examined
the
ticket
curiously
it
announced
the
fact
that
rosenblaum
of
commercial
road
london
had
advanced
ten
shillings
on
a
silver
hunter
watch
and
the
pledge
had
been
made
in
the
name
of
van
heerden
she
gazed
at
it
bewildered
he
was
not
a
man
who
needed
ten
shillings
or
ten
dollars
or
ten
pounds
why
should
he
pledge
a
watch
and
why
having
pledged
it
should
he
keep
the
ticket
with
such
care
oliva
hesitated
a
moment
then
slipped
the
ticket
from
its
cover
put
back
the
envelope
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
and
closed
the
lid
she
found
a
for
the
little
square
pasteboard
before
she
returned
the
box
and
portfolio
to
the
drawer
and
locked
it
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
hastily
she
replaced
the
key
in
her
bag
come
in
she
said
she
recognized
the
man
who
stood
in
the
doorway
as
he
who
had
carried
her
back
to
the
room
there
was
a
strangeness
in
his
bearing
which
made
her
uneasy
a
certain
subdued
hilarity
which
suggested
drunkenness
do
make
a
noise
he
whispered
with
a
stifled
chuckle
if
gregory
hears
he
raise
fire
she
saw
that
the
key
was
in
the
lock
on
the
outside
of
the
door
and
this
she
watched
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
withdraw
it
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
softly
my
name
is
bridgers
he
whispered
van
heerden
has
told
you
about
me
horace
bridgers
do
you
he
took
a
little
tortoiseshell
box
from
the
pocket
of
his
frayed
waistcoat
and
opened
it
with
a
little
kick
of
his
middle
finger
it
was
of
white
powder
that
glittered
in
a
stray
ray
of
sunlight
try
a
sniff
he
begged
eagerly
and
all
your
troubles
will
go
phutt
thank
you
no
she
shook
her
head
looking
at
him
with
a
perplexed
smile
i
do
know
what
it
is
it
the
white
terror
he
chuckled
again
better
than
the
green
not
so
horribly
musty
as
the
green
eh
i
not
in
the
mood
for
terrors
of
any
kind
she
said
with
a
she
wondered
why
he
had
come
and
had
a
momentary
hope
that
he
was
ignorant
of
van
heerden
character
all
right
he
stuffed
the
box
back
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
the
loser
you
never
find
heaven
on
earth
she
waited
all
the
time
he
was
speaking
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
on
the
for
some
interruption
from
below
he
would
stop
in
his
speech
to
turn
a
listening
ear
to
the
door
moreover
she
was
relieved
to
see
he
made
no
attempt
to
advance
any
farther
into
the
room
that
he
was
under
the
influence
of
some
drug
she
guessed
his
eyes
glittered
with
unnatural
brilliance
his
hands
discoloured
and
uncleanly
moved
nervously
and
were
never
still
i
bridgers
he
said
again
i
van
heerden
best
man
rather
a
come
down
for
the
best
analytical
chemist
that
the
school
ever
turned
out
eh
doing
odd
jobs
for
a
dirty
deutscher
he
walked
to
the
door
opened
it
and
listened
then
tiptoed
across
the
room
to
her
you
know
he
whispered
you
van
heerden
girl
what
is
the
game
what
is
she
stammered
what
is
the
game
what
is
it
all
about
i
tried
to
pump
gregory
and
milsom
but
they
mysterious
curse
all
mysteries
my
dear
what
is
the
game
why
are
they
sending
men
to
america
canada
australia
and
india
come
along
and
be
a
pal
tell
me
i
seen
the
office
i
know
all
about
it
thousands
of
sealed
envelopes
filled
with
steamship
tickets
and
money
thousands
of
telegraph
forms
already
addressed
you
do
fool
me
he
hissed
the
last
words
almost
in
her
face
why
is
he
employing
the
crocks
and
the
of
science
perrilli
maxon
boyd
heyler
and
me
if
the
game
square
why
does
he
take
the
new
men
from
the
schools
she
shook
her
head
being
by
now
less
interested
in
such
revelations
as
he
might
make
than
in
her
own
personal
comfort
for
his
attitude
was
grown
menacing
then
the
great
idea
came
to
her
evidently
this
man
knew
nothing
of
the
circumstances
under
which
she
had
come
to
the
house
to
him
she
was
a
wilful
but
willing
assistant
of
the
doctor
who
for
some
reason
or
other
it
had
been
necessary
to
place
under
restraint
i
will
tell
you
everything
if
you
will
take
me
back
to
my
home
she
said
i
can
not
give
you
proofs
here
she
saw
suspicion
gather
in
his
eyes
then
he
laughed
that
wo
wash
he
sneered
you
know
it
all
i
ca
leave
here
he
said
besides
you
told
me
last
time
that
there
was
nothing
i
used
to
watch
you
working
away
at
night
he
went
on
to
the
girl
amazement
i
sat
looking
at
you
for
hours
writing
and
writing
and
writing
she
understood
now
she
and
hilda
glaum
were
of
about
the
same
build
and
she
was
mistaken
for
hilda
by
this
bemused
man
who
had
in
all
probability
never
seen
the
other
girl
face
to
face
what
made
you
run
away
he
asked
suddenly
but
with
a
sudden
resolve
she
brought
him
back
to
the
subject
he
had
started
to
discuss
what
is
the
use
of
my
telling
you
she
asked
you
know
as
much
as
i
only
bits
he
replied
eagerly
but
i
do
know
van
heerden
game
i
know
why
he
marrying
this
other
girl
everybody
knows
that
when
is
the
wedding
what
other
girl
she
asked
cresswell
or
prédeaux
whatever
she
calls
herself
said
bridgers
carelessly
she
was
a
store
girl
was
she
but
she
tried
to
speak
calmly
why
do
you
think
he
wants
to
marry
her
he
laughed
softly
do
be
silly
he
said
you
ca
fool
me
everybody
knows
worth
a
million
worth
a
million
she
gasped
worth
a
million
he
smacked
his
lips
and
fumbled
for
the
little
box
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
try
a
sniff
you
know
what
it
feels
like
to
be
old
man
millinborn
heiress
there
was
a
sound
in
the
hall
below
and
he
turned
with
an
exaggerated
start
she
thought
it
theatrical
but
could
not
know
of
the
jangled
nerves
of
the
man
which
magnified
all
sound
to
an
intensity
which
was
almost
painful
he
opened
the
door
and
slid
out
and
did
not
close
the
door
behind
him
swiftly
she
followed
and
as
she
reached
the
landing
saw
his
head
disappear
down
the
stairs
she
was
in
a
blind
panic
a
thousand
formless
terrors
gripped
her
and
turned
her
resolute
soul
to
water
she
could
have
screamed
her
relief
when
she
saw
that
the
sliding
door
was
the
man
had
not
stopped
to
close
it
and
she
passed
through
and
down
the
first
flight
he
had
vanished
before
she
reached
the
landing
and
the
hall
below
was
empty
it
was
a
wide
hall
with
a
glass
door
between
her
and
the
open
portal
she
flew
down
the
stairs
pulled
open
the
door
and
ran
straight
into
van
heerden
arms
chapter
xvii
the
jew
of
cracow
if
there
were
committed
in
london
the
crime
of
the
century
a
crime
so
tremendous
that
the
names
of
the
chief
actors
in
this
grisly
drama
were
on
the
lips
of
every
man
woman
and
talkative
child
in
europe
you
might
walk
into
a
certain
department
of
scotland
yard
with
the
assurance
that
you
would
not
meet
within
the
confining
walls
of
that
bureau
any
police
officer
who
was
interested
in
the
slightest
or
who
indeed
had
even
heard
of
the
occurrence
save
by
accident
this
department
is
known
as
the
parley
voos
or
department
and
concerns
itself
only
in
suspicious
events
beyond
the
territorial
waters
of
great
britain
and
ireland
its
body
is
on
the
thames
embankment
but
its
soul
is
at
the
central
office
or
at
the
sûreté
or
even
at
the
yamen
of
the
police
minister
of
pekin
it
is
sublimely
ignorant
of
the
masters
of
crime
who
dwell
beneath
the
shadows
of
the
yard
but
it
could
tell
you
without
stopping
to
look
up
reference
not
only
the
names
of
the
known
gunmen
of
new
york
but
the
composition
of
almost
every
secret
society
in
china
a
pole
had
a
quarrel
with
a
jew
in
the
streets
of
cracow
and
they
quarrelled
over
the
only
matter
which
is
worthy
of
quarrel
in
that
part
of
poland
the
sum
in
dispute
was
the
comparatively
paltry
one
of
kronen
but
when
the
jew
was
taken
in
a
dying
condition
to
the
hospital
he
made
a
statement
which
was
so
curious
that
the
chief
of
police
in
cracow
sent
it
on
to
vienna
and
vienna
sent
it
to
berne
and
berne
scratched
its
chin
thoughtfully
and
sent
it
forward
to
paris
where
it
was
distributed
to
rio
de
janeiro
new
york
and
london
the
assistant
chief
of
the
department
came
out
of
his
room
and
drifted
aimlessly
into
the
uncomfortable
bureau
of
mcnorton
there
a
curious
yarn
through
from
cracow
he
said
which
might
interest
your
friend
beale
what
is
it
asked
mcnorton
who
invariably
found
the
stories
of
the
department
fascinating
but
profitless
a
man
was
murdered
said
the
man
lightly
as
though
that
were
the
least
important
feature
of
the
story
but
before
he
pegged
out
he
made
a
will
or
an
assignment
of
his
property
to
his
son
in
the
course
of
which
he
said
that
none
of
his
stocks
he
was
a
corn
factor
were
to
be
sold
under
one
thousand
kronen
a
bushel
that
about
corn
at
a
bushel
said
mcnorton
was
he
delirious
not
at
all
said
the
other
he
was
a
very
man
in
cracow
one
zibowski
who
during
the
late
war
was
principal
buying
agent
for
the
german
government
the
chief
of
the
police
at
cracow
apparently
asked
him
if
he
was
suffering
from
illusions
and
the
man
then
made
a
statement
that
the
german
government
had
an
option
on
all
the
grain
in
galicia
hungary
and
the
ukraine
at
a
lower
price
zibowski
held
out
for
better
terms
it
is
believed
that
he
was
working
with
a
member
of
the
german
government
who
made
a
fortune
in
the
war
out
of
army
contracts
in
fact
he
as
good
as
let
this
out
just
before
he
died
when
he
spoke
in
his
delirium
of
a
wonderful
invention
which
was
being
worked
on
behalf
of
the
german
government
an
invention
called
the
green
rust
mcnorton
whistled
is
that
all
he
said
that
all
said
the
man
i
seem
to
remember
that
beale
had
made
one
or
two
mysterious
references
to
the
rust
where
is
he
now
he
left
town
last
night
replied
mcnorton
can
you
get
in
touch
with
him
the
other
shook
his
head
i
suppose
you
are
sending
on
a
copy
of
this
communication
to
the
cabinet
he
said
it
may
be
rather
serious
whatever
the
scheme
is
it
is
being
worked
in
london
and
van
heerden
is
the
chief
operator
he
took
down
his
hat
and
went
out
in
search
of
kitson
whom
he
found
in
the
lobby
of
the
hotel
james
kitson
came
toward
him
eagerly
have
you
news
of
beale
he
was
at
kingston
this
morning
said
mcnorton
with
parson
homo
but
he
had
left
i
was
on
the
to
the
inspector
at
kingston
who
did
not
know
very
much
and
could
give
me
no
very
definite
news
as
to
whether
beale
had
made
his
discovery
he
interviewed
the
tramp
early
this
morning
but
apparently
extracted
very
little
that
was
helpful
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
came
to
you
to
ask
if
he
had
got
in
touch
with
you
kitson
shook
his
head
i
want
to
see
him
about
his
green
rust
scare
beale
has
gone
into
this
matter
said
the
superintendent
shaking
his
head
and
he
has
played
the
lone
game
a
little
too
long
is
it
very
serious
it
may
be
an
international
matter
replied
mcnorton
gravely
all
that
we
know
at
present
is
this
a
big
plot
is
on
foot
to
tamper
with
the
food
supplies
of
the
world
and
the
chief
plotter
is
van
heerden
beale
knows
more
about
the
matter
than
any
of
us
but
he
only
gives
us
occasional
glimpses
of
the
real
situation
i
have
been
digging
out
van
heerden
record
without
however
finding
anything
very
incriminating
up
to
a
point
he
seems
to
have
been
a
model
citizen
though
his
associates
were
not
always
of
the
best
he
has
been
seen
in
the
company
of
at
least
three
people
with
a
bad
history
milsom
a
doctor
convicted
of
murder
in
the
bridgers
an
american
chemist
with
two
convictions
for
illicit
trading
in
drugs
gregory
who
seems
to
be
his
factotum
and
general
assistant
convicted
in
manchester
for
saccharine
smuggling
and
a
girl
called
glaum
who
is
an
alien
charged
during
the
war
for
failing
to
register
but
against
van
heerden
nothing
he
has
travelled
a
great
deal
in
america
and
on
the
continent
he
was
in
spain
a
few
years
ago
and
was
suspected
of
being
associated
with
the
german
embassy
his
association
with
the
millinborn
murder
you
know
yes
i
know
that
said
james
kitson
bitterly
beale
will
have
to
tell
us
all
he
knows
mcnorton
went
on
and
probably
we
can
tell
him
something
he
does
know
namely
that
van
heerden
conducts
a
pretty
expensive
correspondence
by
cable
with
all
parts
of
the
world
something
has
happened
in
cracow
which
gives
a
value
to
all
beale
suspicions
briefly
he
related
the
gist
of
the
story
which
had
reached
him
that
morning
it
is
incredible
said
kitson
when
the
chief
had
finished
it
would
be
humanly
impossible
for
the
world
to
buy
at
that
price
and
there
is
no
reason
for
it
it
happens
that
i
am
interested
in
a
milling
corporation
and
i
know
that
the
world
crops
are
good
in
fact
the
harvest
will
be
well
above
the
average
i
should
say
that
the
cracow
jew
was
talking
in
delirium
but
mcnorton
smiled
indulgently
i
hope
you
right
he
said
i
hope
the
whole
thing
is
a
mare
nest
and
for
once
in
my
life
i
trust
that
the
police
clues
are
as
wrong
as
hell
but
anyway
van
heerden
is
cabling
mighty
freely
and
i
want
beale
but
beale
was
unreachable
a
visit
to
his
apartment
produced
no
results
the
foreign
gentleman
who
on
the
previous
day
had
called
on
van
heerden
had
been
seen
there
that
morning
but
he
too
had
vanished
and
none
of
mcnorton
watchers
had
been
able
to
pick
him
up
mcnorton
shifted
the
direction
of
his
search
and
dropped
into
the
palatial
establishment
of
punsonby
he
strolled
past
the
desk
which
had
once
held
oliva
cresswell
and
saw
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
a
stranger
in
her
place
and
by
her
side
the
darkly
taciturn
hilda
glaum
white
that
pompous
man
greeted
him
strangely
as
the
police
chief
came
into
the
private
office
white
turned
deadly
pale
and
became
of
a
sudden
bereft
of
speech
mcnorton
recognized
the
symptoms
from
long
acquaintance
with
the
characteristics
of
detected
criminals
and
wondered
how
deeply
this
pompous
man
was
committed
to
whatever
scheme
was
hatching
ah
ah
mr
mcnorton
stammered
white
shaking
like
a
leaf
wo
you
sit
down
please
to
what
to
what
he
swallowed
twice
before
he
could
get
the
words
out
to
what
am
i
indebted
just
called
in
to
look
you
up
said
mcnorton
genially
have
you
been
losing
any
more
registered
letters
lately
white
subsided
again
into
his
chair
yes
yes
no
i
mean
he
said
no
ah
thank
you
it
was
kind
of
you
to
call
inspector
superintendent
corrected
the
other
a
thousand
pardons
superintendent
said
white
hastily
no
sir
nothing
so
unfortunate
he
shot
a
look
at
the
police
officer
and
how
is
your
friend
doctor
van
heerden
white
twisted
uncomfortably
in
his
chair
again
his
look
of
nervousness
and
apprehension
ah
van
heerden
is
not
a
friend
of
mine
he
said
a
business
acquaintance
he
sighed
heavily
just
a
business
acquaintance
the
white
he
had
known
was
not
the
white
of
the
man
looked
older
his
face
was
more
heavily
lined
and
his
eyes
were
dark
with
weariness
i
suppose
he
a
pretty
shrewd
fellow
he
remarked
carelessly
you
are
interested
in
some
of
his
concerns
are
you
only
one
only
one
replied
white
sharply
and
i
wish
to
heaven
he
stopped
himself
and
you
wish
you
were
eh
again
the
older
man
wriggled
in
his
chair
doctor
van
heerden
is
very
clever
he
said
he
has
great
schemes
in
one
of
which
i
am
ah
financially
interested
that
is
all
i
have
put
money
into
his
ah
syndicate
without
of
course
knowing
the
nature
of
the
work
which
is
being
carried
out
that
i
would
impress
upon
you
you
are
a
trusting
investor
said
the
mcnorton
i
am
a
child
in
matters
of
finance
admitted
white
but
added
quickly
except
of
course
in
so
far
as
the
finance
of
punsonby
which
is
one
of
the
soundest
business
concerns
in
london
mcnorton
we
pay
our
dividends
regularly
and
our
balance
sheets
are
a
model
for
the
industrial
world
so
i
have
heard
said
mcnorton
dryly
i
am
interested
in
syndicates
too
by
the
way
what
is
doctor
van
heerden
scheme
white
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
have
the
slightest
idea
he
confessed
with
a
melancholy
smile
i
suppose
it
is
very
foolish
of
me
but
i
have
such
faith
in
the
genius
that
when
he
came
to
me
and
said
dear
white
i
want
you
to
invest
a
few
thousand
in
one
of
my
concerns
i
said
dear
doctor
here
is
my
cheque
do
bother
me
about
the
details
but
send
in
my
dividends
regularly
ha
ha
his
laugh
was
hollow
and
would
not
have
deceived
a
child
of
ten
so
you
invested
began
mcnorton
forty
thousand
gasped
white
how
did
you
know
he
went
a
trifle
paler
these
things
get
about
said
mcnorton
as
i
was
going
to
say
you
invested
without
troubling
to
discover
what
sort
of
work
the
syndicate
was
undertaking
i
am
not
speaking
now
as
a
police
officer
white
he
went
on
and
white
did
not
disguise
his
relief
but
as
an
old
acquaintance
of
yours
say
friend
said
the
fervent
white
i
have
always
regarded
you
mcnorton
as
a
friend
of
mine
let
me
see
how
long
have
we
known
one
another
i
think
the
first
time
we
met
was
when
punsonby
was
burgled
in
it
a
long
time
said
mcnorton
but
do
let
us
get
off
the
subject
of
your
investment
which
interests
me
as
a
friend
you
gave
doctor
van
heerden
all
this
money
without
even
troubling
to
discover
whether
his
enterprise
was
a
legal
one
i
am
not
suggesting
it
was
illegal
he
said
as
white
opened
his
mouth
to
protest
but
it
seems
strange
that
you
did
not
trouble
to
inquire
oh
of
course
i
inquired
naturally
i
inquired
mcnorton
said
white
eagerly
it
was
for
some
chemical
process
and
i
know
nothing
about
chemistry
i
do
mind
admitting
to
you
he
lowered
his
voice
though
there
was
no
necessity
that
i
regret
my
investment
very
much
we
business
men
have
many
calls
we
can
not
allow
our
money
to
be
tied
up
for
too
long
a
time
and
it
happens
ah
that
just
at
this
moment
i
should
be
very
glad
very
glad
indeed
to
liquidate
that
investment
mcnorton
nodded
he
knew
a
great
deal
more
about
white
financial
embarrassments
than
that
gentleman
gave
him
credit
for
he
knew
for
example
that
the
immaculate
managing
director
of
punsonby
was
in
the
hands
of
moneylenders
and
that
those
moneylenders
were
squeezing
him
he
suspected
that
all
was
not
well
with
punsonby
there
had
been
curious
rumours
in
the
city
amongst
the
bill
discounters
that
paper
left
much
to
be
desired
do
you
know
the
nationality
of
van
heerden
he
asked
dutch
replied
white
promptly
are
you
sure
of
this
i
would
stake
my
life
on
it
answered
the
heroic
white
as
i
came
through
to
your
office
i
saw
a
young
lady
at
the
desk
miss
glaum
i
think
her
name
is
is
she
dutch
too
miss
glaum
ah
well
miss
glaum
white
hesitated
a
very
nice
industrious
girl
and
a
friend
of
doctor
van
heerden
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
engaged
her
at
his
recommendation
you
see
i
was
under
an
obligation
to
the
doctor
he
had
ah
attended
me
in
my
illness
that
this
was
untrue
mcnorton
knew
white
was
one
of
those
financial
shuttlecocks
which
shrewd
moneylenders
toss
from
one
to
the
other
white
had
been
introduced
by
van
heerden
to
capital
in
a
moment
of
hectic
despair
and
had
responded
when
his
financial
horizon
was
clearer
by
pledging
his
credit
for
the
furtherance
of
van
heerden
scheme
of
course
you
know
that
as
a
shareholder
in
van
heerden
syndicate
you
can
not
escape
responsibility
for
the
purposes
to
which
your
money
is
put
he
said
as
he
rose
to
go
i
hope
you
get
your
money
back
do
you
think
there
is
any
doubt
demanded
white
in
consternation
there
is
always
a
doubt
about
getting
money
back
from
syndicates
said
mcnorton
cryptically
please
do
go
yet
white
passed
round
the
end
of
his
desk
and
intercepted
the
detective
with
unexpected
agility
taking
so
to
speak
the
door
out
of
his
hands
and
closing
it
i
am
alarmed
mcnorton
he
said
as
he
led
the
other
back
to
his
chair
i
wo
disguise
it
i
am
seriously
alarmed
by
what
you
have
said
it
is
not
the
thought
of
losing
the
money
oh
dear
no
punsonby
would
not
be
ruined
by
ah
a
paltry
it
is
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
so
the
sinister
suggestion
in
your
speech
inspector
superintendent
i
mean
is
it
possible
he
stood
squarely
in
front
of
mcnorton
his
hands
on
his
hips
his
eyeglass
dangling
from
his
fastidious
fingers
and
his
head
pulled
back
as
though
he
wished
to
avoid
contact
with
the
possibility
is
it
possible
that
in
my
ignorance
i
have
been
assisting
to
finance
a
scheme
which
is
ah
illegal
immoral
improper
and
contrary
ah
to
the
best
interests
of
the
common
weal
he
shook
his
head
as
though
he
were
unable
to
believe
his
own
words
everything
is
possible
in
finance
said
mcnorton
with
a
smile
i
am
not
saying
that
doctor
van
heerden
syndicate
is
an
iniquitous
one
i
have
not
even
seen
a
copy
of
his
articles
of
association
doubtless
you
could
oblige
me
in
that
respect
i
have
got
such
a
thing
denied
white
vigorously
the
syndicate
was
not
registered
it
was
so
to
speak
a
private
concern
but
the
exploitation
of
green
rust
suggested
the
superintendent
and
the
man
face
lost
the
last
vestige
of
colour
it
possessed
the
green
rust
he
faltered
i
have
heard
the
phrase
i
know
nothing
you
know
nothing
but
suspect
the
worst
said
mcnorton
now
i
am
going
to
speak
plainly
to
you
the
reason
you
know
nothing
about
this
syndicate
of
van
heerden
is
because
you
had
a
suspicion
that
it
was
being
formed
for
an
illegal
purpose
please
do
interrupt
me
you
know
nothing
because
you
did
not
want
to
know
i
doubt
even
whether
you
deceived
yourself
you
saw
a
chance
of
making
big
money
white
and
big
money
has
always
had
an
attraction
for
you
there
is
a
scheme
that
was
ever
hatched
in
a
back
alley
bar
that
you
dropped
money
over
and
you
saw
a
chance
here
more
tangible
than
any
that
had
been
presented
to
you
i
swear
to
you
began
white
the
time
has
not
come
for
you
to
swear
anything
said
mcnorton
sternly
there
is
only
one
place
where
a
man
need
take
his
oath
and
that
is
on
the
i
will
tell
you
this
frankly
that
we
are
as
much
in
the
dark
as
you
pretend
to
be
there
is
only
one
man
who
knows
or
guesses
the
secret
of
the
green
rust
and
that
man
is
beale
beale
you
have
met
the
gentleman
i
believe
i
hope
you
do
have
to
meet
him
again
the
green
rust
may
mean
little
it
may
mean
no
more
than
that
you
will
lose
your
money
and
i
should
imagine
that
is
the
least
which
will
happen
to
you
on
the
other
hand
white
i
do
not
disguise
from
you
the
fact
that
it
may
also
mean
your
death
at
the
hands
of
the
law
white
made
a
gurgling
noise
in
his
throat
and
held
on
to
the
desk
for
support
i
have
only
the
haziest
information
as
to
what
it
is
all
about
but
somehow
mcnorton
knit
his
brows
in
a
frown
and
was
speaking
half
to
himself
i
seem
to
feel
that
it
is
a
bad
business
a
damnably
bad
business
he
took
up
his
hat
from
the
table
and
walked
to
the
door
i
do
know
whether
to
say
au
revoir
or
he
said
with
twitching
lips
ah
is
a
very
good
word
said
white
in
an
heroic
attempt
to
imitate
the
other
good
humour
chapter

bridgers
breaks
loose
van
heerden
sat
by
the
side
of
the
big
bed
where
the
girl
lay
and
his
cold
blue
eyes
held
a
spark
of
amusement
you
look
very
foolish
he
said
oliva
cresswell
turned
her
head
sharply
so
as
to
remove
the
man
from
her
line
of
vision
more
than
this
she
could
not
do
for
her
hands
and
feet
were
strapped
and
on
the
pillow
near
her
head
was
a
big
saturated
with
water
which
had
been
employed
in
stifling
her
healthy
screams
which
marked
her
return
to
understanding
you
look
very
foolish
said
the
doctor
chewing
at
the
end
of
his
cigar
and
you
look
no
more
foolish
than
you
have
been
bridgers
let
you
out
eh
nice
man
bridgers
what
had
he
been
telling
you
she
turned
her
head
again
and
favoured
him
with
a
stare
then
she
looked
at
the
angry
red
mark
on
her
wrists
where
the
straps
chafed
how
she
said
but
this
time
he
smiled
you
will
not
make
me
lose
my
temper
again
he
mocked
her
you
may
call
me
hun
or
heinz
or
fritz
or
any
of
the
barbarous
and
vulgar
names
which
the
outside
world
employ
to
vilify
my
countrymen
but
nothing
you
say
will
distress
or
annoy
me
you
and
i
will
be
man
and
wife
this
is
not
germany
she
said
scornfully
you
can
not
make
a
woman
marry
you
against
her
will
this
is
the
land
of
the
free
he
interrupted
suavely
yes
i
know
those
lands
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
but
even
there
curious
things
happen
and
you
going
to
marry
me
you
will
say
to
the
sleek
english
clergyman
when
he
asks
you
whether
you
will
take
this
man
to
be
your
married
husband
to
love
and
cherish
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
say
i
shall
say
she
said
steadily
you
will
say
he
smiled
i
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
give
sufficient
time
to
you
so
that
i
might
persuade
you
to
act
sensibly
i
could
have
employed
arguments
which
i
think
would
have
convinced
you
that
there
are
worse
things
than
marriage
with
me
i
can
not
think
of
any
she
replied
coldly
then
you
are
singularly
dense
said
the
doctor
i
have
already
told
you
the
conditions
under
which
that
marriage
will
take
place
there
might
be
no
marriage
you
know
and
a
different
end
to
this
adventure
he
said
significantly
and
she
shivered
he
said
nothing
more
for
five
minutes
simply
sitting
biting
at
the
cigar
between
his
teeth
and
looking
at
her
blankly
as
though
his
thoughts
were
far
away
and
she
was
the
least
of
the
problems
which
confronted
him
i
know
it
is
absurd
to
ask
you
he
said
suddenly
but
i
presume
you
have
not
devoted
any
of
your
studies
to
the
question
of
capital
punishment
i
see
you
have
but
there
is
one
interesting
fact
about
the
execution
of
criminals
which
is
not
generally
known
to
the
public
and
it
is
that
in
many
countries
my
own
for
example
before
a
man
is
led
to
execution
he
is
doped
with
a
drug
which
i
will
call
does
that
interest
you
she
made
no
reply
and
he
laughed
quietly
it
should
interest
you
very
much
he
said
the
effect
of
bromocine
he
went
on
speaking
with
the
quiet
precision
of
one
who
was
lecturing
on
the
subject
to
an
interested
audience
is
peculiar
it
reduces
the
subject
to
a
condition
of
extreme
lassitude
so
that
really
nothing
matters
or
seems
to
matter
whilst
perfectly
conscious
the
subject
goes
obediently
to
his
death
behaves
normally
and
does
just
what
he
is
told
in
fact
it
destroys
the
will
why
do
you
tell
me
this
she
asked
a
sudden
fear
gripping
her
heart
he
in
his
chair
reached
out
his
hand
and
took
a
little
black
case
from
the
table
near
the
window
this
he
laid
on
the
bed
and
opened
and
she
watched
him
fascinated
he
took
a
tiny
bottle
containing
a
colourless
liquid
and
with
great
care
laid
it
on
the
coverlet
then
he
extracted
a
small
hypodermic
syringe
and
a
nozzle
he
uncorked
the
bottle
inserted
the
syringe
and
filled
it
then
he
screwed
on
the
needle
pressed
the
plunger
until
a
fine
jet
leapt
in
the
air
then
he
laid
it
carefully
back
in
the
case
you
say
you
will
not
marry
me
and
i
presume
that
you
would
make
a
scene
when
i
bring
in
the
good
english
parson
to
perform
the
ceremony
i
had
hoped
he
said
apologetically
to
have
given
you
a
wedding
with
all
the
pomp
and
circumstance
which
women
as
i
understand
love
failing
that
i
hoped
for
a
quiet
wedding
in
the
little
church
out
yonder
he
jerked
his
head
toward
the
window
but
now
i
am
afraid
that
i
must
ask
his
reverence
to
carry
out
the
ceremony
in
this
house
he
rose
leant
over
her
and
deftly
pulled
back
her
sleeve
if
you
scream
i
shall
smother
you
with
the
towel
he
said
this
hurt
you
very
much
as
i
was
going
to
say
you
will
be
married
here
because
you
are
in
a
delicate
state
of
health
and
you
will
say
she
winced
as
the
needle
punctured
the
skin
it
wo
hurt
you
for
very
long
he
said
calmly
you
will
say
i
repeat
because
i
shall
tell
you
to
say
suddenly
the
sharp
pricking
pain
in
her
arm
ceased
she
was
conscious
of
a
sensation
as
though
her
arm
was
being
blown
up
like
a
bicycle
tyre
but
it
was
not
unpleasant
he
withdrew
the
needle
and
kept
his
finger
pressed
upon
the
little
red
wound
where
it
had
gone
in
i
shall
do
this
to
you
again
he
said
and
you
will
not
feel
it
at
all
and
morning
and
you
will
not
care
very
much
what
happens
i
hope
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
give
you
a
dose
afternoon
i
shall
not
always
be
under
the
influence
of
this
drug
she
said
between
her
teeth
and
there
will
be
a
time
of
reckoning
for
you
van
heerden
by
which
time
he
said
calmly
i
shall
have
committed
a
crime
so
wonderful
and
so
enormous
that
the
mere
offence
of
a
noxious
drug
that
is
the
terminology
which
describes
the
offence
will
be
of
no
importance
and
hardly
worth
the
consideration
of
the
crown
officers
now
i
think
i
can
unfasten
you
he
loosened
and
removed
the
straps
at
her
wrists
and
about
her
feet
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
you
had
better
get
up
and
walk
about
he
said
or
you
will
be
stiff
i
am
really
being
very
kind
to
you
if
you
only
knew
it
i
am
too
big
to
be
vindictive
and
by
the
way
i
had
an
interesting
talk
with
your
friend
beale
this
afternoon
a
persistent
young
man
who
has
been
having
me
shadowed
all
day
he
laughed
quietly
if
i
had
to
go
back
to
the
surgery
for
the
bromocine
i
should
have
missed
our
very
interesting
conversation
that
young
man
is
very
much
in
love
with
you
he
looked
amusedly
at
the
growing
red
in
her
face
he
is
very
much
in
love
with
you
he
repeated
what
a
pity
what
a
thousand
pities
how
soon
will
this
drug
begin
to
act
she
asked
are
you
frightened
no
but
i
should
welcome
anything
which
made
me
oblivious
to
your
presence
you
are
not
exactly
a
pleasant
companion
she
said
with
a
return
to
the
old
tone
he
knew
so
well
content
yourself
little
person
he
said
with
simulated
affection
you
will
soon
be
rid
of
me
why
do
you
want
to
marry
me
i
can
tell
you
that
now
he
said
because
you
are
a
very
rich
woman
and
i
want
your
money
half
of
which
comes
to
me
on
my
marriage
then
the
man
spoke
the
truth
she
sat
up
suddenly
but
the
effort
made
her
head
swim
he
caught
her
by
the
shoulders
and
laid
her
gently
down
what
man
not
that
babbling
idiot
bridgers
he
said
something
but
instantly
recovered
his
keep
quiet
he
said
with
professional
sternness
yes
you
are
the
heiress
of
an
interesting
gentleman
named
john
millinborn
john
millinborn
she
gasped
the
man
who
was
murdered
the
man
who
was
killed
he
corrected
is
a
stupid
vulgar
word
yes
my
dear
you
are
his
heiress
he
was
your
uncle
and
he
left
you
something
over
six
million
dollars
that
is
to
say
he
left
us
that
colossal
sum
but
i
do
understand
what
does
it
mean
your
name
is
prédeaux
your
father
was
the
ruffian
i
know
i
know
she
cried
the
man
in
the
hotel
the
man
who
died
my
father
interesting
is
it
he
said
calmly
like
something
out
of
a
book
yes
my
dear
that
was
your
parent
a
dissolute
ruffian
whom
you
will
do
well
to
forget
i
heard
john
millinborn
tell
his
lawyer
that
your
mother
died
of
a
broken
heart
penniless
as
a
result
of
your
father
cruelty
and
unscrupulousness
and
i
should
imagine
that
that
was
the
truth
my
father
she
murmured
she
lay
her
face
as
white
as
the
pillow
her
eyes
closed
john
millinborn
left
a
fortune
for
you
and
i
think
that
you
might
as
well
know
the
truth
now
the
money
was
left
in
trust
you
were
not
to
know
that
you
were
an
heiress
until
you
were
married
he
was
afraid
of
some
ruining
your
young
life
as
prédeaux
ruined
your
mother
that
was
thoughtful
of
him
now
i
do
intend
ruining
your
life
i
intend
leaving
you
with
half
your
uncle
fortune
and
the
capacity
for
enjoying
all
that
life
can
hold
for
a
young
woman
i
not
do
it
i
not
do
it
i
not
do
it
she
muttered
he
rose
from
the
chair
and
bent
over
her
my
young
friend
you
are
going
to
sleep
he
said
to
himself
waited
a
little
longer
and
left
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
him
he
descended
to
the
hall
and
passed
into
the
big
beneath
the
girl
bedroom
the
room
had
two
occupants
a
stout
hairless
man
who
had
neither
hair
eyebrows
nor
vestige
of
beard
and
a
younger
man
hello
bridgers
said
van
heerden
addressing
the
latter
you
been
talking
well
who
does
snarled
the
man
he
pulled
the
tortoiseshell
box
from
his
pocket
opened
the
lid
and
took
a
pinch
from
its
contents
snuffling
the
powder
luxuriously
that
stuff
will
kill
you
one
of
these
days
said
van
heerden
it
will
make
him
growled
the
hairless
man
i
mind
people
who
take
cocaine
as
long
as
they
are
taking
it
it
between
dopes
that
they
get
on
my
nerves
milsom
speaks
like
a
christian
and
an
artist
said
bridgers
with
sudden
cheerfulness
if
i
did
dope
van
heerden
i
should
not
be
working
in
your
beastly
factory
but
would
probably
be
one
of
the
leading
analytical
chemists
in
america
but
i
go
back
to
do
my
chore
he
said
rising
i
suppose
i
get
a
little
commission
for
restoring
your
palpitating
bride
milsom
tells
me
that
it
is
she
i
thought
it
was
the
other
dame
the
dutch
girl
i
guess
i
was
a
bit
dopey
van
heerden
frowned
you
take
too
keen
an
interest
in
my
affairs
he
said
aw
you
getting
touchy
if
i
did
get
interested
in
something
go
mad
chuckled
bridgers
he
had
reached
that
stage
of
cocaine
intoxication
when
the
world
was
a
very
pleasant
place
indeed
and
full
of
subject
for
jocularity
this
place
is
getting
right
on
my
nerves
he
went
on
could
i
go
to
london
i
stagnating
here
why
some
of
the
stuff
i
cultivated
the
other
day
would
react
is
that
so
milsom
i
get
so
dull
in
this
hole
that
all
bugs
look
alike
to
me
van
heerden
glanced
at
the
man
who
was
addressed
as
milsom
and
the
latter
nodded
let
him
go
back
he
said
i
look
after
him
how
the
lady
asked
milsom
when
they
were
alone
the
other
made
a
gesture
and
milsom
nodded
it
good
stuff
he
said
i
used
to
give
it
to
lunatics
in
the
days
of
long
ago
van
heerden
did
not
ask
him
what
those
days
were
he
never
pryed
too
closely
into
the
early
lives
of
his
associates
but
milsom
history
was
public
property
four
years
before
he
had
completed
a
life
sentence
of
fifteen
years
for
a
crime
which
had
startled
the
world
in
how
are
things
generally
he
asked
van
heerden
shrugged
his
shoulders
for
the
first
time
i
am
getting
nervous
he
said
it
is
so
much
the
fear
of
beale
that
rattles
me
but
the
sordid
question
of
money
the
expenses
are
colossal
and
continuous
has
your
government
milsom
balked
at
the
word
have
your
friends
abroad
moved
in
the
matter
yet
van
heerden
shook
his
head
i
am
very
hopeful
there
he
said
i
have
been
watching
the
papers
very
closely
especially
the
agrarian
papers
and
unless
i
am
mistaken
there
is
a
decided
movement
in
the
direction
of
support
but
i
depend
on
that
the
marriage
must
go
through
white
is
getting
nervous
too
he
went
on
he
is
pestering
me
about
the
money
i
owe
him
or
rather
the
syndicate
owes
him
he
on
the
verge
of
ruin
milsom
made
a
little
grimace
then
he
squeal
he
said
those
kind
of
people
always
do
have
to
keep
him
quiet
you
say
the
marriage
is
coming
off
i
have
notified
the
parson
said
van
heerden
i
told
him
my
fiancée
is
too
ill
to
attend
the
church
and
the
ceremony
must
be
performed
here
milsom
nodded
he
had
risen
from
the
table
and
was
looking
out
upon
the
pleasant
garden
at
the
rear
of
the
house
a
man
could
do
worse
than
put
in
three
or
four
weeks
here
he
said
look
at
that
spread
of
green
he
pointed
to
an
expanse
of
waving
grasses
starred
with
the
blossoms
of
wild
flowers
i
was
never
a
lover
of
nature
said
van
heerden
carelessly
milsom
grunted
you
have
never
been
in
prison
he
said
cryptically
is
it
time
to
give
your
lady
another
dose
not
for
two
hours
said
van
heerden
i
will
play
you
at
piquet
the
cards
were
shuffled
and
the
hands
dealt
when
there
was
a
scamper
of
feet
in
the
hall
the
door
burst
open
and
a
man
ran
in
he
was
wearing
a
soiled
white
smock
and
his
face
was
distorted
with
terror
he
cried
that
imbecile
bridgers
what
wrong
van
heerden
sprang
to
his
feet
i
think
he
is
mad
he
is
dancing
about
the
grounds
singing
and
he
has
with
him
the
preparation
van
heerden
rapped
out
an
oath
and
leapt
through
the
door
the
doctor
at
his
heels
they
took
the
short
cut
and
ran
up
the
steps
leading
from
the
well
courtyard
and
bursting
through
the
bushes
came
within
sight
of
the
offender
but
he
was
not
dancing
now
he
was
standing
with
open
mouth
staring
stupidly
about
him
i
dropped
it
i
dropped
it
he
stammered
there
was
no
need
for
van
heerden
to
ask
what
he
had
dropped
for
the
green
lawn
which
had
excited
milsom
admiration
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
in
its
place
was
a
black
irregular
patch
of
earth
which
looked
as
though
it
had
been
blasted
in
the
furnaces
of
hell
and
the
air
was
filled
with
the
pungent
mustiness
of
decay
chapter
xix
oliva
is
willing
it
seemed
that
a
grey
curtain
of
mist
hung
before
oliva
eyes
it
was
a
curtain
spangled
with
tiny
globes
of
dazzling
light
which
grew
from
nothing
and
faded
to
nothing
whenever
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
one
of
these
it
straightway
became
two
and
three
and
then
an
unaccountable
quantity
she
felt
that
she
ought
to
see
faces
of
people
she
knew
for
one
half
of
her
brain
had
cleared
and
was
calmly
diagnosing
her
condition
but
doing
so
as
though
she
were
somebody
else
she
was
emerging
from
a
drugged
sleep
she
could
regard
herself
in
a
curious
impersonal
fashion
which
was
most
interesting
and
people
who
are
drugged
see
things
and
people
strange
mirages
of
the
mind
arise
and
stranger
illusions
are
suffered
yet
she
saw
nothing
save
this
silvery
grey
curtain
with
its
drifting
spots
of
light
and
heard
nothing
except
a
voice
saying
come
along
come
along
wake
up
a
hundred
a
thousand
times
this
monotonous
order
was
repeated
and
then
the
grey
curtain
faded
and
she
was
lying
on
the
bed
her
head
throbbing
her
eyes
hot
and
prickly
and
two
men
were
looking
down
at
her
one
of
them
a
big
barefaced
man
with
a
coarse
mouth
and
sunken
eyes
was
it
my
father
really
she
asked
drowsily
i
was
afraid
of
that
second
dose
you
gave
her
last
night
said
milsom
you
are
getting
a
condition
of
coma
and
that
the
last
thing
you
want
she
be
all
right
now
replied
van
heerden
but
his
face
was
troubled
the
dose
was
severe
yet
she
seemed
healthy
enough
to
stand
a
injection
milsom
shook
his
head
she
be
all
right
now
but
she
might
as
easily
have
died
he
said
i
should
repeat
the
dose
there
no
need
said
van
heerden
what
time
is
it
asked
the
girl
and
sat
up
she
felt
very
weak
and
weary
but
she
experienced
no
giddiness
it
is
twelve
you
have
been
sleeping
since
seven
last
night
let
me
see
if
you
can
stand
get
up
she
obeyed
meekly
she
had
no
desire
to
do
anything
but
what
she
was
told
her
mental
condition
was
one
of
complete
dependence
and
had
she
been
left
to
herself
she
would
have
been
content
to
lie
down
again
yet
she
felt
for
a
moment
a
most
intense
desire
to
propound
some
sort
of
plan
which
would
give
this
man
the
money
without
going
through
a
marriage
ceremony
that
desire
lasted
a
minute
and
was
succeeded
by
an
added
weariness
as
though
this
effort
at
independent
thought
had
added
a
new
burden
to
her
strength
she
knew
and
was
mildly
amazed
at
the
knowledge
that
she
was
under
the
influence
of
a
drug
which
was
destroying
her
will
yet
she
felt
no
particular
urge
to
make
a
fight
for
freedom
of
determination
freedom
of
determination
she
repeated
the
words
having
framed
her
thoughts
with
punctilious
exactness
and
remembered
that
that
was
a
great
war
phrase
which
one
was
constantly
discovering
in
the
newspapers
all
her
thoughts
were
like
this
they
had
the
form
of
marshalled
language
so
that
even
her
speculations
were
punctuated
walk
over
to
the
window
said
the
doctor
and
she
obeyed
though
her
knees
gave
way
with
every
step
she
took
now
come
back
good
all
right
she
looked
at
him
and
did
not
flinch
when
he
laid
his
two
hands
on
her
shoulders
you
are
going
to
be
married
this
afternoon
that
all
right
it
yes
she
said
that
is
all
right
and
you
say
when
i
tell
you
to
say
wo
you
yes
i
say
that
she
said
all
the
time
she
knew
that
this
was
monstrously
absurd
all
the
time
she
knew
that
she
did
not
wish
to
marry
this
man
fine
sentences
pompously
framed
slowly
formed
in
her
mind
such
as
this
outrage
will
not
go
unpunished
comma
and
you
will
suffer
for
this
comma
van
heerden
full
stop
but
the
effort
of
creating
the
protest
exhausted
her
so
that
she
could
not
utter
it
and
she
knew
that
the
words
were
stilted
and
artificial
and
the
of
her
brain
whispered
that
she
was
recalling
and
adapting
something
she
had
heard
at
the
theatre
she
wanted
to
do
the
easiest
thing
and
it
seemed
absurdly
easy
to
say
yes
you
will
stay
here
until
the
parson
comes
said
van
heerden
and
you
will
not
attempt
to
escape
will
you
no
i
wo
attempt
to
escape
she
said
lie
down
she
sat
on
the
bed
and
swung
her
feet
clear
of
the
ground
settling
herself
comfortably
she
do
said
van
heerden
satisfied
come
downstairs
milsom
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
so
they
left
her
lying
with
her
cheek
on
her
hand
more
absorbed
in
the
pattern
on
the
than
in
the
tremendous
events
which
threatened
well
what
the
trouble
asked
milsom
seating
himself
in
his
accustomed
place
by
the
table
this
said
van
heerden
and
threw
a
letter
across
to
him
it
came
by
one
of
my
scouts
this
morning
i
did
go
home
last
night
i
can
not
risk
being
shadowed
here
milsom
opened
the
letter
slowly
and
read
a
man
called
upon
you
yesterday
afternoon
and
has
made
several
calls
since
he
was
seen
by
beale
who
him
man
calls
himself
stardt
but
is
apparently
not
british
he
is
staying
at
saraband
hotel
berners
street
who
is
this
asked
milsom
i
dare
not
hope
replied
the
doctor
pacing
the
room
nervously
suppose
you
dared
what
form
would
your
hope
take
i
told
you
the
other
day
said
van
heerden
stopping
before
his
companion
that
i
had
asked
my
government
to
assist
me
hitherto
they
have
refused
that
is
why
i
am
so
desperately
anxious
to
get
this
marriage
through
i
must
have
money
the
paddington
place
costs
a
small
fortune
you
go
back
there
by
the
way
milsom
nodded
has
the
government
relented
he
asked
i
do
know
i
told
you
that
certain
significant
items
in
the
east
prussian
newspapers
seemed
to
hint
that
they
were
coming
to
my
assistance
they
have
sent
no
word
to
me
but
if
they
should
agree
they
would
send
their
agreement
by
messenger
and
you
think
this
may
be
the
man
it
is
likely
what
have
you
done
i
have
sent
gregory
up
to
see
the
man
if
he
is
what
i
hope
he
may
be
gregory
will
bring
him
here
i
have
given
him
the
password
what
difference
will
it
make
asked
milsom
you
are
on
to
a
big
fortune
anyway
fortune
the
eyes
of
van
heerden
sparkled
and
he
seemed
to
expand
at
the
splendour
of
the
vision
which
was
conjured
to
his
eyes
no
fortune
which
mortal
man
has
ever
possessed
will
be
comparable
all
the
riches
of
all
the
world
will
lie
at
my
feet
milliards
upon
milliards
in
fact
a
lot
of
money
said
the
practical
milsom
i
do
quite
see
how
you
are
going
to
do
it
you
have
taken
me
very
much
into
your
confidence
van
heerden
you
know
everything
milsom
chuckled
i
know
that
in
the
safe
of
my
office
you
have
a
thousand
sealed
envelopes
addressed
as
i
gather
to
all
the
scallywags
of
the
world
and
i
know
pretty
well
what
you
intend
doing
but
how
do
you
benefit
and
how
do
i
benefit
van
heerden
had
recovered
his
you
have
already
benefited
he
said
shortly
more
than
you
could
have
hoped
there
was
an
awkward
pause
then
milsom
asked
what
effect
is
it
going
to
have
upon
this
country
it
will
ruin
england
said
van
heerden
fervently
and
the
old
criminal
eyes
narrowed
he
said
again
and
there
was
a
note
in
his
voice
which
made
van
heerden
look
at
him
quickly
this
country
has
done
very
much
for
you
he
sneered
and
i
have
done
much
for
this
country
yet
countered
the
other
the
doctor
laughed
you
turning
into
a
patriot
in
your
old
age
he
said
something
like
that
said
milsom
easily
there
used
to
be
a
fellow
at
portland
you
have
probably
run
across
him
a
clever
crook
named
homo
who
used
to
be
a
parson
before
he
got
into
trouble
i
never
met
the
gentleman
and
talking
of
parsons
he
said
looking
at
his
watch
our
own
padre
is
late
but
i
interrupted
you
he
was
a
man
whose
tongue
i
loathed
and
he
hated
me
poisonously
said
milsom
with
a
little
grimace
but
he
used
to
say
that
patriotism
was
the
only
form
of
religion
which
survived
penal
servitude
and
i
suppose
that
the
case
i
hate
the
thought
of
putting
this
country
in
wrong
you
get
over
your
scruples
said
the
other
easily
you
are
putting
yourself
in
right
anyway
think
of
the
beautiful
time
you
going
to
have
my
friend
i
think
of
nothing
else
said
milsom
but
still
he
shook
his
head
van
heerden
had
taken
up
the
paper
he
had
brought
down
and
was
reading
it
and
milsom
noted
that
he
was
perusing
the
produce
columns
when
do
we
make
a
start
next
week
said
the
doctor
i
want
to
finish
up
the
paddington
factory
and
get
away
where
will
you
go
i
shall
go
to
the
continent
replied
van
heerden
folding
up
the
paper
and
laying
it
on
the
table
i
can
conduct
operations
from
there
with
greater
ease
gregory
goes
to
canada
mitchell
and
samps
have
already
organized
australia
and
our
three
men
in
india
will
have
ready
workers
what
about
the
states
that
has
an
organization
of
its
own
van
heerden
said
it
is
costing
me
a
lot
of
money
all
the
men
except
you
are
at
their
stations
waiting
for
the
word
you
will
take
the
canadian
supplies
with
you
do
i
take
bridgers
van
heerden
shook
his
head
i
ca
trust
that
fool
otherwise
he
would
be
an
ideal
assistant
for
you
your
work
is
simple
before
you
leave
i
will
give
you
a
sealed
envelope
containing
a
list
of
all
our
canadian
agents
you
will
also
find
two
code
sentences
one
of
which
means
operations
and
the
other
all
instructions
and
destroy
apparatus
will
the
latter
be
necessary
asked
milsom
it
may
be
though
it
is
very
unlikely
but
i
must
provide
against
all
contingencies
i
have
made
the
organization
as
simple
as
possible
i
have
a
chief
agent
in
every
country
and
on
receipt
of
my
message

the
chief
of

will
be
repeated
to
the
agents
who
also
have
a
copy
of
the
code

seems
too
easy
said
milsom
what
chance
is
there
of
detection
none
whatever
said
the
doctor
promptly
our
only
danger
for
the
moment
is
this
man
beale
but
he
knows
nothing
and
so
long
as
we
only
have
him
guessing
there
is
no
great
harm
done
and
anyway
he
much
longer
to
guess
it
seems
much
too
simple
said
milsom
shaking
his
head
van

heard
a
footfall
in
the
hall
stepped
quickly
to
the
door
and
opened
it
well

he
said

here
replied
the

and
waved
his
hand
to
a
figure
who
stood
behind
him
also
the
parson

coming
down
the
road

let
us
have
our
friend
in
the

with
his

moustache
and
his

stepped
into

heels
and
bowed

i
the

with
a
smile

nodded

open
the
envelope
and
read
the
half
a
dozen
lines
the
is
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
the
messenger
beamed
i
have
the
honour
to
convey
to
you
the
word
he
whispered
something
in
van
heerden
ear
and
milsom
who
did
not
understand
german
very
well
and
had
been
trying
to
pick
up
a
word
or
two
saw
the
look
of
exultation
that
came
to
the
doctor
face
he
leapt
back
and
threw
out
his
arms
and
his
strong
voice
rang
with
the
words
which
the
german
hymnal
has
made
famous
gott
sei
dank
durch
alle
welt
gott
sei
dank
durch
alle
welt
what

milsom

his
eyes
ablaze
the
government

with
me
behind
me
my
beautiful
country
oh
gott

dank
the
parson
warned
milsom
a
young
man
stood
looking
through
the
open
door
the
parson
yes
said
van
heerden
there
no
need
for
it
but
have
this
wedding
yes

have
it
come
in

he
was
almost
boyishly
jovial
milsom
had
never
seen
him
like
that
before
come
in
sir
i
am
sorry
to
hear
your
fiancée

the
curate

but
that
will
not
hinder
the
ceremony
i
go
myself
and
prepare
her
milsom
had
walked
round
the
table
to
the
window
and
it
was
he
who
checked
the
doctor
as
he
was
leaving
the
room
doctor
he
said
come
here
van
heerden
detected
a
strain
of
anxiety
in
the
other
voice
what
is
it
he
said
do
you
hear
somebody
speaking
they
stood
by
the
window
and
listened
intently
come
with
me
said
the
doctor
and
he
walked
noiselessly
and
ascended
the
stairs
followed
more
slowly
by
his
heavier
companion
chapter

the
marriage
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
deans
folly
a
was
halted
on
the
side
of
a
hill
overlooking
the
valley
in
which
van
heerden
house
was
set
that
the
house
said
beale
consulting
the
map
and
that
wall
that
runs
along
the
road
is
the
wall
the
tramp
described
you
seem
to
put
a
lot
of
faith
in
the
statement
of
a
man
suffering
from
delirium
tremens
said
parson
homo
dryly
he
was
not
suffering
from
delirium
tremens
this
morning
you
did
see
him
homo
shook
his
head
i
was
in
london
fixing
the
preliminaries
of
your
nuptials
he
said
sarcastically
it
may
be
the
house
he
admitted
where
is
the
entrance
there
a
road
midway
between
here
and
the
river
and
a
private
road
leading
off
said
beale
the
gate
i
presume
is
hidden
somewhere
in
those
bushes
he
raised
a
pair
of
and
focused
them
yes
the
gate
there
he
said
do
you
see
that
man
homo
took
the
glasses
and
looked
looks
like
a
watcher
he
said
and
if
it
is
your
friend
place
the
gate
will
be
locked
and
barred
why
do
you
get
a
warrant
beale
shook
his
head
he
get
wind
of
it
and
be
gone
no
our
way
in
is
over
the
wall
the
said
there
a
garden
door
somewhere
they
left
the
car
and
walked
down
the
hill
and
presently
came
to
a
corner
of
the
high
wall
which
surrounded
deans
folly
beale
passed
on
ahead
here
the
door
he
said
he
tried
it
gingerly
and
it
gave
a
little
it
clogged
and
you
wo
get
it
open
said
homo
it
the
wall
or
nothing
beale
looked
up
and
down
the
road
there
was
nobody
in
sight
and
he
made
a
leap
caught
the
top
of
the
wall
and
drew
himself
up
luckily
the
usual
de
was
absent
beneath
him
and
a
little
to
the
right
was
a
shed
built
against
the
wall
the
door
of
which
was
closed
he
signalled
homo
to
follow
and
dropped
to
the
ground
in
a
minute
both
men
were
sheltering
in
the
clump
of
bushes
where
on
the
previous
day
oliva
had
waited
before
making
a
dart
for
the
garden
door
there
been
a
fire
here
said
homo
in
a
low
voice
and
pointed
to
a
big
ugly
patch
of
black
amidst
the
green
beale
surveyed
it
carefully
then
wormed
his
way
through
the
bushes
until
he
was
within
reach
of
the
ruined
plot
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
pulled
in
a
handful
of
the
debris
examined
it
carefully
and
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket
you
are
greatly
interested
in
a
grass
fire
said
homo
curiously
yes
are
i
replied
beale
they
spent
the
next
hour
reconnoitring
the
ground
once
the
door
of
the
opened
two
men
came
out
and
walked
to
the
house
and
they
had
to
lie
motionless
until
after
a
seemingly
interminable
interval
they
returned
again
stopping
in
the
middle
of
the
black
patch
to
talk
beale
saw
one
pointing
to
the
ruin
and
the
other
shook
his
head
and
they
both
returned
to
the
shed
and
the
door
closed
behind
them
there
somebody
coming
down
the
main
drive
whispered
homo
they
were
now
near
the
house
and
from
where
they
lay
had
a
clear
view
of
fifty
yards
of
the
drive
it
a
brother
brush
said
homo
in
a
chuckling
whisper
a
what
asked
beale
a
parson
a
parson
he
focused
his
glasses
some
one
in
clerical
attire
accompanied
by
the
man
whom
beale
recognized
as
the
guard
of
the
gate
was
walking
quickly
down
the
drive
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
but
now
for
the
first
time
doubts
assailed
him
his
great
scheme
seemed
more
fantastic
and
its
difficulties
more
real
what
could
be
easier
than
to
spring
out
and
intercept
the
clergyman
but
would
that
save
the
girl
what
force
did
the
house
hold
he
had
to
deal
with
men
who
would
stop
short
at
nothing
to
achieve
their
purpose
and
in
particular
one
man
who
had
not
hesitated
at
murder
he
felt
his
heart
thumping
not
at
the
thought
of
danger
though
danger
he
knew
was
all
round
but
from
sheer
panic
that
he
himself
was
about
to
play
an
unworthy
part
whatever
fears
or
doubts
he
may
have
had
suddenly
fell
away
from
him
and
he
rose
to
his
knees
for
not
twenty
yards
away
at
a
window
her
hands
grasping
the
bars
her
apathetic
eyes
looking
listlessly
toward
where
he
crouched
was
oliva
cresswell
regardless
of
danger
he
broke
cover
and
ran
toward
her
miss
cresswell
he
called
she
looked
at
him
across
the
concrete
well
without
astonishment
and
without
interest
it
is
you
she
said
with
extraordinary
calm
he
stood
on
the
brink
of
the
well
hesitating
it
was
too
far
to
leap
and
he
remembered
that
behind
the
lilac
bush
he
had
seen
a
builder
plank
this
he
dragged
out
and
passed
it
across
the
chasm
leaning
the
other
end
upon
a
ledge
of
brickwork
which
butted
from
the
house
he
stepped
quickly
across
gripped
the
bars
and
found
a
foothold
on
the
ledge
the
girl
standing
watching
him
without
any
sign
of
interest
he
knew
something
was
wrong
he
could
not
even
guess
what
that
something
was
this
was
not
the
girl
he
knew
but
an
oliva
cresswell
from
whom
all
vitality
and
life
had
been
sapped
you
know
me
he
said
i
am
mr
beale
i
know
you
are
beale
she
replied
evenly
i
have
come
to
save
you
he
said
rapidly
will
you
trust
me
i
want
you
to
trust
me
he
said
earnestly
i
want
you
to
summon
every
atom
of
faith
you
have
in
human
nature
and
invest
it
in
me
will
you
do
this
for
me
i
will
do
this
for
you
she
said
like
a
child
repeating
a
lesson
i
i
want
you
to
marry
me
he
realized
as
he
said
these
words
in
what
his
fear
was
founded
he
knew
now
that
it
was
her
refusal
even
to
go
through
the
form
of
marriage
which
he
dared
not
face
the
truth
leapt
up
to
him
and
sent
the
blood
pulsing
through
his
head
that
behind
and
beyond
his
professional
care
for
her
he
loved
her
he
waited
with
bated
breath
expecting
her
amazement
her
indignation
her
distress
but
she
was
serene
and
untroubled
did
not
so
much
as
raise
her
eyelids
by
the
fraction
of
an
inch
as
she
answered
i
will
marry
you
he
tried
to
speak
but
could
only
mutter
a
hoarse
thank
you
he
turned
his
head
homo
stood
at
the
end
of
the
plank
and
he
beckoned
him
parson
homo
came
to
the
centre
of
the
frail
bridge
slipped
a
prayer
book
from
his
tail
pocket
and
opened
it
dearly
beloved
we
are
come
together
here
in
the
sight
of
god
to
join
together
this
man
and
this
woman
in
holy
matrimony
i
require
and
charge
you
both
as
ye
will
answer
at
the
dreadful
day
of
judgment
when
the
secret
of
all
hearts
shall
be
disclosed
that
if
either
of
you
know
any
impediment
why
ye
may
not
be
joined
together
in
matrimony
ye
do
now
confess
it
beale
lips
were
tight
pressed
the
girl
was
looking
serenely
upward
to
a
white
cloud
that
sailed
across
the
western
skies
homo
read
quickly
his
enunciation
beautifully
clear
and
beale
found
himself
wondering
when
last
this
man
had
performed
so
sacred
an
office
he
asked
the
inevitable
question
and
beale
answered
homo
hesitated
then
turned
to
the
girl
wilt
thou
have
this
man
to
be
thy
wedded
husband
to
live
together
after
god
ordinance
in
the
holy
estate
of
matrimony
wilt
thou
obey
him
and
serve
him
love
honour
and
keep
him
in
sickness
and
in
health
and
forsaking
all
others
keep
thee
only
unto
him
so
long
as
ye
both
shall
live
the
girl
did
not
immediately
answer
and
the
pause
was
painful
to
the
two
men
but
for
different
reasons
then
she
suddenly
withdrew
her
gaze
from
the
sky
and
looked
homo
straight
in
the
face
i
will
she
said
the
next
question
in
the
service
he
dispensed
with
he
placed
their
hands
together
and
together
repeating
his
words
they
plighted
their
troth
homo
leant
forward
and
again
joined
their
hands
and
a
note
of
unexpected
solemnity
vibrated
in
his
voice
when
he
spoke
those
whom
god
hath
joined
together
let
no
man
put
asunder
beale
drew
a
deep
breath
then
very
pretty
indeed
said
a
voice
the
detective
swung
across
the
window
to
bring
the
speaker
into
a
line
of
fire
put
down
your
gun
admirable
mr
beale
van
heerden
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
the
bulky
figure
of
milsom
filled
the
doorway
very
pretty
indeed
and
most
picturesque
said
van
heerden
i
like
to
interrupt
the
ceremony
perhaps
you
will
now
come
into
the
house
beale
and
i
will
explain
a
few
things
to
you
you
need
not
trouble
about
your
wife
she
will
not
be
harmed
beale
revolver
still
in
hand
made
his
way
to
the
door
and
was
admitted
you
had
better
come
along
homo
he
said
we
may
have
to
bluff
this
out
van
heerden
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
hall
and
invited
him
no
farther
you
are
perfectly
at
liberty
to
take
away
your
wife
said
van
heerden
she
will
probably
explain
to
you
that
i
have
treated
her
with
every
consideration
here
she
is
oliva
was
descending
the
stairs
with
slow
deliberate
steps
i
might
have
been
very
angry
with
you
van
heerden
went
on
with
that
insolent
drawl
of
his
happily
i
do
not
find
it
any
longer
necessary
to
marry
miss
cresswell
i
was
just
explaining
to
this
gentleman
he
pointed
to
the
pallid
young
curate
in
the
background
when
your
voices
reached
me
nevertheless
i
think
it
only
right
to
tell
you
that
your
marriage
is
not
a
legal
one
though
i
presume
you
are
provided
with
a
special
licence
why
is
it
illegal
asked
beale
he
wondered
if
parson
homo
had
been
recognized
in
the
first
place
because
it
was
not
conducted
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
said
van
heerden
it
was
homo
who
laughed
i
am
afraid
that
would
make
it
illegal
but
for
the
fact
that
you
witnessed
the
ceremony
by
your
own
confession
and
so
presumably
did
your
fat
friend
behind
you
milsom
scowled
you
were
always
a
bitter
dog
to
me
parson
he
said
but
i
can
give
you
a
reason
why
it
illegal
he
said
triumphantly
that
man
is
parson
homo
a
crook
who
was
kicked
out
of
the
church
fifteen
years
ago
i
worked
alongside
him
in
portland
homo
smiled
crookedly
you
are
right
up
to
a
certain
point
milsom
he
said
but
you
are
wrong
in
one
essential
by
a
curious
oversight
i
was
never
unfrocked
and
i
am
still
legally
a
priest
of
the
church
of
england
heavens
gasped
beale
then
this
marriage
is
legal
it
as
legal
as
it
can
possibly
be
said
parson
homo
complacently
chapter
xxi
beale
sees
white
in
a
sense
said
lawyer
kitson
it
is
a
tragedy
in
a
sense
it
is
a
comedy
the
most
fatal
comedy
of
errors
that
could
be
imagined
stanford
beale
sat
on
a
low
chair
his
head
in
his
hands
the
picture
of
dejection
i
do
mind
your
kicks
he
said
without
looking
up
you
ca
say
anything
worse
about
me
than
i
am
saying
about
myself
oh
i
been
a
fool
an
arrogant
mad
fool
kitson
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
under
his
tail
coat
his
perched
on
his
nose
looked
down
at
the
young
man
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
that
i
was
against
the
idea
from
the
beginning
because
that
is
unnecessary
i
ought
to
have
put
my
foot
down
and
stopped
it
i
heard
you
were
pretty
clever
with
a
gun
stanford
why
did
you
sail
in
and
rescue
the
girl
as
soon
as
you
found
where
she
was
i
do
think
there
would
have
been
a
ghost
of
a
chance
said
the
other
looking
up
i
am
not
finding
excuses
but
i
am
telling
you
what
i
know
there
were
four
or
five
men
in
the
house
and
they
were
all
pretty
tough
citizens
i
doubt
if
i
would
have
made
it
that
way
you
think
he
would
have
married
her
he
admitted
as
much
said
stanford
beale
the
parson
was
already
there
when
i
butted
in
what
steps
are
you
taking
to
deal
with
this
man
van
heerden
beale
laughed
helplessly
i
can
not
take
any
until
miss
cresswell
recovers
beale
murmured
kitson
and
the
other
went
red
i
guess
we
call
her
miss
cresswell
if
you
do
mind
he
said
sharply
see
here
kitson
you
need
make
things
worse
than
they
are
i
can
do
nothing
until
she
recovers
and
can
give
us
a
statement
as
to
what
happened
mcnorton
will
execute
the
warrant
just
as
soon
as
we
can
formulate
a
charge
in
fact
he
is
waiting
downstairs
in
the
hope
of
seeing
he
paused
miss
cresswell
what
does
the
doctor
say
she
sleeping
now
it
maddening
maddening
groaned
beale
and
yet
if
it
were
so
horrible
i
could
laugh
yesterday
i
was
waiting
for
a
to
come
out
of
delirium
tremens
i
am
waiting
for
miss
cresswell
to
recover
from
some
devilish
drug
i
made
a
failure
of
it
mr
kitson
i
afraid
you
have
said
the
other
dryly
what
do
you
intend
doing
but
does
it
occur
to
you
asked
kitson
slowly
that
this
lady
is
not
aware
that
she
has
married
you
and
that
we
got
to
break
the
news
to
her
that
the
part
i
do
like
and
you
can
bet
it
does
fill
me
with
rollicking
high
spirits
snapped
beale
it
a
most
awful
situation
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
the
other
again
what
are
you
going
to
do
replied
the
exasperated
beale
after
all
you
her
lawyer
and
you
her
husband
said
kitson
grimly
which
reminds
me
he
walked
to
his
desk
and
took
up
a
slip
of
paper
i
drew
this
out
against
your
coming
this
is
a
certified
cheque
for
that
is
nearly
two
million
dollars
which
i
am
authorized
to
hand
to
oliva
husband
on
the
day
of
her
wedding
beale
took
it
from
the
other
fingers
read
it
carefully
and
tore
it
into
little
pieces
after
which
conversation
flagged
after
awhile
beale
asked
what
do
i
have
to
do
to
get
a
divorce
well
said
the
lawyer
by
the
english
law
if
you
leave
your
wife
and
go
away
and
refuse
to
return
to
her
she
can
apply
to
a
judge
of
the
high
court
who
will
order
you
to
return
within
fourteen
days
i
come
back
in
fourteen
seconds
if
she
wanted
me
said
beale
fervently
you
hopeless
said
kitson
you
asked
how
you
could
get
a
divorce
i
presume
you
want
one
of
course
i
do
i
want
to
undo
the
whole
of
this
horrible
tangle
absurd
and
undignified
can
nothing
be
done
without
miss
cresswell
knowing
nothing
can
be
done
without
your
wife
knowledge
said
kitson
he
seemed
to
take
a
fiendish
pleasure
in
reminding
the
unhappy
young
man
of
his
misfortune
i
am
not
blaming
you
he
said
more
soberly
i
blame
myself
when
i
took
this
trust
from
poor
john
millinborn
i
never
realized
all
that
it
meant
or
all
the
responsibility
it
entailed
how
could
i
imagine
that
the
detective
i
employed
to
protect
the
girl
from
fortune
hunters
would
marry
her
i
am
not
complaining
he
said
hastily
seeing
the
wrath
rise
in
beale
face
it
is
very
unfortunate
and
you
are
as
much
the
victim
of
circumstances
as
i
but
unhappily
we
have
not
been
the
real
victims
i
suppose
said
beale
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
if
i
were
one
of
those
grand
little
mediæval
knights
or
one
of
those
gallant
gentlemen
one
reads
about
i
should
blow
my
brains
out
that
would
be
a
solution
said
kitson
but
we
should
still
have
to
explain
to
your
wife
that
she
was
a
widow
then
what
am
i
to
do
have
a
cigar
said
kitson
he
took
two
from
his
vest
pocket
and
handed
one
to
his
companion
and
his
shrewd
old
eyes
twinkled
it
years
and
years
since
i
read
a
romantic
story
he
said
and
i
have
followed
the
trend
of
modern
literature
very
closely
but
i
think
that
your
job
is
to
sail
in
and
make
the
lady
love
you
beale
jumped
to
his
feet
do
you
mean
that
pshaw
it
absurd
it
ridiculous
she
would
never
love
me
i
do
see
why
anybody
should
least
of
all
your
wife
said
kitson
but
it
would
certainly
simplify
matters
and
then
marry
her
all
over
again
said
kitson
sending
a
big
ring
of
smoke
into
the
air
there
no
law
against
it
you
can
marry
as
many
times
as
you
like
providing
you
marry
the
same
woman
but
suppose
suppose
she
loves
somebody
else
asked
beale
hoarsely
why
then
it
will
be
tough
on
you
said
kitson
but
tougher
on
her
your
business
is
to
see
that
she
does
love
somebody
else
but
how
a
look
of
infinite
weariness
passed
across
kitson
face
he
removed
his
glasses
and
put
them
carefully
into
their
case
really
as
a
detective
he
said
you
may
be
a
prize
exhibit
but
as
an
ordinary
human
being
you
would
even
get
a
consolation
prize
you
have
got
me
into
a
mess
and
you
have
got
to
get
me
out
john
millinborn
was
concerned
only
with
one
thing
the
happiness
of
his
niece
if
you
can
make
your
wife
stanford
beale
beale
groaned
if
you
can
make
your
good
lady
happy
said
the
remorseless
lawyer
my
trust
is
fulfilled
i
believe
you
are
a
white
man
beale
he
said
with
a
change
in
his
tone
and
that
her
money
means
nothing
to
you
i
may
not
be
able
to
give
a
young
man
advice
as
to
the
best
method
of
courting
his
wife
but
i
know
something
about
human
nature
and
if
you
are
not
straight
i
have
made
one
of
my
biggest
mistakes
my
advice
to
you
is
to
leave
her
alone
for
a
day
or
two
until
she
quite
recovered
you
have
plenty
to
occupy
your
mind
go
out
and
fix
van
heerden
but
not
for
his
treatment
of
the
girl
she
must
figure
in
a
case
of
that
kind
for
all
the
facts
will
come
out
you
think
you
have
another
charge
against
him
well
prove
it
that
man
killed
john
millinborn
and
i
believe
you
can
put
him
behind
bars
as
the
guardian
angel
of
oliva
cresswell
you
have
shown
certain
lamentable
deficiencies
the
smile
in
his
eyes
was
infectious
and
stanford
beale
smiled
in
sympathy
in
that
capacity
i
have
no
further
use
for
your
services
and
you
are
fired
but
you
can
consider
yourself
on
the
spot
to
settle
with
van
heerden
i
will
pay
all
the
expenses
of
the
chase
but
get
him
he
put
out
his
hand
and
stanford
gripped
it
you
a
great
man
sir
he
breathed
the
old
man
chuckled
and
you
may
even
be
a
great
detective
he
said
in
five
minutes
your
lassimus
white
will
be
here
you
suggested
i
should
send
for
him
who
is
he
by
the
way
the
managing
director
of
punsonby
a
friend
of
van
heerden
and
a
shareholder
in
his
great
adventure
but
he
knows
nothing
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
a
came
into
the
with
a
card
show
the
gentleman
up
said
kitson
it
is
our
friend
he
explained
and
he
may
know
a
great
deal
said
beale
white
stalked
into
the
room
dangling
his
glasses
with
the
one
hand
and
holding
his
shiny
silk
hat
with
the
other
he
invariably
carried
his
hat
as
though
it
were
a
rifle
he
were
shouldering
he
bowed
ceremoniously
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
ah
kitson
he
said
and
advanced
a
big
hand
i
received
your
note
and
am
as
you
will
observe
punctual
i
may
say
that
my
favourite
motto
is
is
the
politeness
of
princes
you
know
mr
beale
white
bowed
stiffly
i
have
ah
met
mr
beale
in
my
unregenerate
days
said
beale
cheerfully
but
i
am
quite
sober
now
i
am
delighted
to
learn
this
said
white
i
am
extremely
glad
to
learn
this
kitson
asked
you
to
come
white
but
really
it
is
i
who
want
to
see
you
said
beale
to
be
perfectly
frank
i
learnt
that
you
were
in
some
slight
difficulty
difficulty
white
bristled
me
sir
in
difficulty
the
head
of
the
firm
of
punsonby
whose
credit
stands
sir
as
a
model
of
sound
industrial
finance
oh
no
sir
beale
was
taken
aback
he
had
depended
upon
information
which
came
from
unimpeachable
sources
to
secure
the
of
this
pompous
windbag
i
sorry
he
said
i
understood
that
you
had
called
a
meeting
of
creditors
and
had
offered
to
sell
certain
shares
in
a
syndicate
which
i
had
hoped
to
take
off
your
hands
white
inclined
his
head
graciously
it
is
true
sir
he
said
that
i
asked
a
few
ah
wholesale
firms
to
meet
me
and
to
talk
over
things
it
is
also
true
that
i
ah
had
shares
which
had
ceased
to
interest
me
but
those
shares
are
sold
sold
has
van
heerden
bought
them
in
asked
beale
eagerly
and
white
nodded
doctor
van
heerden
a
remarkable
man
a
truly
remarkable
man
he
shook
his
head
as
if
he
could
not
bring
himself
and
never
would
bring
himself
to
understand
how
remarkable
a
man
the
doctor
was
doctor
van
heerden
has
repurchased
my
shares
and
they
have
made
me
a
very
handsome
profit
when
was
this
asked
beale
i
really
can
not
allow
myself
to
be
young
man
he
said
severely
by
your
accent
i
perceive
that
you
are
of
origin
but
i
can
not
allow
you
to
hustle
me
hustle
i
believe
is
the
word
the
firm
of
punsonby
forget
said
beale
tersely
punsonby
has
been
on
the
verge
of
collapse
for
eight
years
let
get
square
white
punsonby
is
a
one
man
company
and
you
that
man
its
balance
sheets
are
faked
its
reserves
are
its
sinking
fund
is
sir
i
tell
you
i
know
punsonby
i
had
the
best
accountants
in
london
working
out
your
position
and
i
know
you
live
from
hand
to
mouth
and
that
the
margin
between
your
business
and
bankruptcy
is
as
near
as
the
margin
between
you
and
prison
white
was
very
pale
but
that
is
my
business
and
i
dare
say
that
the
money
van
heerden
paid
you
this
morning
will
stave
off
your
creditors
anyway
i
not
running
a
pure
business
campaign
i
running
a
campaign
against
your
german
friend
van
heerden
a
german
said
the
virtuous
white
in
loud
astonishment
surely
not
a
holland
gentleman
he
a
german
and
you
know
it
you
been
financing
him
in
a
scheme
to
ruin
the
greater
part
of
europe
and
the
united
states
to
say
nothing
of
canada
south
america
india
and
australia
i
protest
against
such
an
inhuman
charge
said
white
solemnly
and
he
rose
i
can
not
stay
here
any
longer
if
you
go
i
lay
information
against
you
said
beale
i
in
dead
earnest
so
you
can
go
or
stay
first
of
all
i
want
to
know
in
what
form
you
received
the
money
by
cheque
replied
white
in
a
flurry
on
what
bank
the
london
branch
of
the
swedland
national
bank
a
secret
branch
of
the
dresdner
bank
said
beale
that
promising
has
doctor
van
heerden
ever
paid
you
money
before
by
now
white
was
the
most
tractable
of
witnesses
all
his
old
assurance
had
vanished
and
his
answers
were
almost
apologetic
in
tone
yes
beale
small
sums
on
what
bank
on
my
own
bank
good
again
have
you
ever
known
that
he
had
an
account
elsewhere
for
example
you
advanced
him
a
very
considerable
sum
of
money
was
your
cheque
cleared
through
the
swedland
national
bank
no
sir
through
my
own
bank
beale
fingered
his
chin
money
this
morning
and
he
took
his
loss
in
good
part
that
can
only
mean
one
thing
he
nodded
white
you
have
supplied
me
with
valuable
information
i
trust
i
have
said
nothing
which
may
ah
incriminate
one
who
has
invariably
treated
me
with
the
highest
respect
white
hastened
to
say
not
more
than
he
is
incriminated
smiled
stanford
one
more
question
you
know
that
van
heerden
is
engaged
in
some
sort
of
business
the
business
in
which
you
invested
your
money
where
are
his
factories
but
here
white
protested
he
could
offer
no
information
he
recalled
not
without
a
sinking
of
heart
a
similar
on
the
previous
day
at
the
hands
of
mcnorton
there
were
factories
van
heerden
had
hinted
as
much
but
as
to
where
they
were
located
well
confessed
white
he
had
the
slightest
idea
that
rubbish
said
beale
roughly
you
know
where
did
you
communicate
with
van
heerden
he
was
always
at
his
flat
and
you
only
came
there
twice
i
assure
you
began
white
alarmed
by
the
other
vehemence
assure
nothing
thundered
beale
your
policies
wo
sell
where
did
you
see
him
on
my
honour
let
keep
jokes
outside
of
the
argument
said
beale
truculently
where
did
you
see
him
believe
me
i
never
saw
him
if
i
had
a
message
to
send
my
cashier
ah
miss
glaum
an
admirable
young
lady
carried
it
for
me
hilda
glaum
beale
struck
his
palm
why
had
he
not
thought
of
hilda
glaum
before
that
about
all
i
want
to
ask
you
white
he
said
mildly
a
lucky
man
lucky
sir
white
recovered
his
hauteur
as
quickly
as
aggressiveness
passed
i
fail
to
perceive
my
fortune
i
fail
to
see
sir
where
luck
comes
in
you
have
your
money
back
said
beale
significantly
if
you
been
pressed
for
money
and
had
not
pressed
van
heerden
you
would
have
whistled
for
it
do
you
suggest
demanded
white
in
his
best
judicial
manner
do
you
suggest
in
the
presence
of
a
witness
with
a
due
appreciation
of
the
actionable
character
of
your
words
that
doctor
van
heerden
is
a
common
swindler
not
common
replied
beale
thank
goodness
chapter
xxii
hilda
glaum
leads
the
way
beale
had
a
long
consultation
with
mcnorton
at
scotland
yard
and
on
his
return
to
the
hotel
had
his
dinner
sent
up
to
kitson
private
room
and
dined
amidst
a
litter
of
open
newspapers
they
were
representative
journals
of
the
past
week
and
he
scanned
their
columns
carefully
now
and
again
he
would
cut
out
a
paragraph
and
in
one
case
half
a
column
kitson
who
was
dining
with
a
friend
in
the
restaurant
of
the
hotel
came
up
toward
nine
and
stood
looking
with
amusement
at
the
detective
silent
labours
you
making
a
deplorable
litter
in
my
room
he
said
but
i
suppose
there
is
something
very
mysterious
and
terrible
behind
it
all
do
you
mind
my
reading
your
cuttings
go
ahead
said
beale
without
raising
his
eyes
from
his
newspaper
kitson
took
up
a
slip
and
read
aloud
the
reserves
of
the
land
bank
of
the
ukraine
have
been
increased
by
ten
million
roubles
this
increase
has
very
considerably
eased
the
situation
in
southern
ukraine
and
in
galicia
where
there
has
been
considerable
unrest
amongst
the
peasants
due
to
the
high
cost
of
textiles
that
is
fascinating
news
said
kitson
sardonically
are
you
running
a
on
high
finance
no
said
the
other
shortly
the
land
bank
is
a
loan
bank
it
finances
peasant
proprietors
you
a
shareholder
asked
kitson
wonderingly
no
kitson
picked
up
another
cutting
it
was
a
telegraphic
dispatch
dated
from
berlin
as
evidence
of
the
healthy
industrial
tone
which
prevails
in
germany
and
the
rapidity
with
which
the
government
is
recovering
from
the
effects
of
the
war
i
may
instance
the
fact
that
an
order
has
been
placed
with
the
leipzieger
spoorwagen
gesselshaft
for
box
cars
the
order
has
been
placed
by
the
with
thirty
firms
and
the
first
delivery
is
due
in
six
weeks
that
exciting
said
kitson
but
why
cut
it
out
the
next
cutting
was
also
dated
berlin
and
announced
the
revival
of
the
war
purchase
council
of
the
old
belligerent
days
as
a
temporary
measure
it
is
not
intended
said
the
dispatch
to
invest
the
committee
with
all
its
old
functions
and
the
step
has
been
taken
in
view
of
the
bad
potato
crop
to
organize
distribution
what
the
joke
about
that
asked
kitson
now
puzzled
the
joke
is
that
there
is
no
potato
shortage
there
never
was
such
a
good
harvest
said
beale
i
keep
tag
of
these
things
and
i
know
the
had
an
article
from
its
berlin
correspondent
last
week
saying
that
potatoes
were
so
plentiful
that
they
were
a
drug
on
the
market
h
did
you
read
about
the
zeppelin
sheds
asked
beale
you
will
find
it
amongst
the

all
the
old

state

turned
into

wonderful

what
does
it
all
mean
asked
the
bewildered
lawyer
that
the
day
the
real
day
is
near
at
hand
said
beale
soberly
war
against
the
world
but
without
the
flash
of
a
bayonet
or
the
boom
of
a
cannon
a
war
fought
by
men
sitting
in
their
little
offices
and
pulling
the
strings
that
will
choke
you
and
me
kitson
i
am
going
after
van
heerden
i
may
catch
him
and
yet
fail
to
arrest
his
evil
work
that
a
funny
word
for
everyday
people
to
use
but
there
no
other
like
it
whether
i
catch
him
or
not
i
will
tell
you
the
story
of
the
plot
i
accidentally
discovered
the
british
government
thinks
that
i
have
got
on
the
track
of
a
big
thing
so
does
washington
and
i
having
all
the
help
i
want
it
a
queer
world
said
kitson
it
may
be
queerer
responded
beale
then
boldly
how
is
my
wife
your
well
i
like
your
nerve
gasped
kitson
i
thought
you
preferred
it
that
way
how
is
miss
cresswell
the
nurse
says
she
is
doing
famously
she
is
sleeping
now
but
she
woke
up
for
food
and
is
nearly
normal
she
did
not
ask
for
you
he
added
pointedly
beale
flushed
and
laughed
my
last
attempt
to
be
merry
he
said
i
suppose
that
she
will
be
well
but
not
receiving
visitors
kitson
was
careful
to
warn
him
you
will
keep
your
mind
off
oliva
and
keep
your
eye
fixed
on
van
heerden
if
you
are
wise
no
man
can
serve
two
masters
stanford
beale
looked
at
his
watch
it
is
the
hour
he
said
oracularly
and
got
up
i
leave
this
untidiness
for
your
man
to
clear
said
kitson
where
do
you
go
now
to
see
hilda
glaum
if
the
fates
are
kind
said
beale
i
going
to
put
up
a
bluff
believing
that
in
her
panic
she
will
lead
me
into
the
lion
den
with
the
idea
of
van
heerden
making
one
mouthful
of
me
got
to
take
that
risk
if
she
is
what
i
think
she
is
she
lay
a
trap
for
me
i
fall
for
it
but
i
going
to
get
next
to
van
heerden
kitson
accompanied
him
to
the
door
of
the
hotel
take
no
unnecessary
risks
he
said
at
parting
do
forget
that
you
a
married
man
that
one
of
the
things
i
want
to
forget
if
you
let
me
said
the
exasperated
young
man
outside
the
hotel
he
hailed
a
passing
taxi
and
was
soon
speeding
through
piccadilly
westward
he
turned
by
hyde
park
corner
skirted
the
grounds
of
buckingham
palace
and
plunged
into
the
maze
of
pimlico
he
pulled
up
before
a
house
in
a
blank
and
dreary
street
and
telling
the
cabman
to
wait
mounted
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
a
diminutive
maid
opened
the
door
is
miss
glaum
in
he
demanded
yes
sir
will
you
step
into
the
all
the
other
boarders
are
out
what
name
shall
i
say
tell
her
a
gentleman
from
krooman
mansions
he
answered
diplomatically
he
walked
into
the
tawdry
parlour
and
put
down
his
hat
and
stick
and
waited
presently
the
door
opened
and
the
girl
came
in
she
stopped
with
surprise
at
the
sight
of
him
and
her
surprise
deepened
to
suspicion
i
thought
she
began
and
checked
herself
you
thought
i
was
doctor
van
heerden
well
i
am
not
you
the
man
i
saw
at
heyler
she
said
glowering
at
him
yes
my
name
is
beale
oh
i
heard
about
you
you
get
nothing
by
prying
here
she
cried
i
shall
get
a
great
deal
by
prying
here
i
think
he
said
calmly
sit
down
miss
hilda
glaum
and
let
us
understand
one
another
you
are
a
friend
of
doctor
van
heerden
i
shall
answer
no
questions
she
snapped
perhaps
you
will
answer
this
question
he
said
why
did
doctor
van
heerden
secure
an
appointment
for
you
at
punsonby
and
why
when
you
were
there
did
you
steal
three
registered
envelopes
which
you
conveyed
to
the
doctor
her
face
went
red
and
white
that
a
lie
she
gasped
you
might
tell
a
judge
and
jury
that
and
then
they
would
believe
you
he
smiled
come
miss
glaum
let
us
be
absolutely
frank
with
one
another
i
am
telling
you
that
i
do
intend
bringing
your
action
to
the
notice
of
the
police
and
you
can
give
me
a
little
information
which
will
be
very
useful
to
me
it
a
lie
she
repeated
visibly
agitated
i
did
not
steal
anything
if
miss
cresswell
says
so
miss
cresswell
is
quite
ignorant
of
your
treachery
said
the
other
quietly
but
as
you
are
determined
to
deny
that
much
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
this
what
business
brings
you
to
doctor
van
heerden
flat
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
do
you
insinuate
i
insinuate
nothing
and
least
of
all
do
i
insinuate
that
you
have
any
love
affair
with
the
doctor
who
does
not
strike
me
as
that
kind
of
person
her
eyes
narrowed
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
her
natural
vanity
would
overcome
her
discretion
who
says
i
go
to
doctor
van
heerden
i
say
so
because
i
have
seen
you
surely
you
do
forget
that
i
live
opposite
the
amiable
doctor
i
am
not
going
to
discuss
my
business
or
his
she
said
and
i
care
what
you
threaten
me
with
or
what
you
do
i
will
do
something
more
than
threaten
you
he
said
ominously
you
will
not
fool
me
miss
glaum
and
the
sooner
you
realize
the
fact
the
better
i
am
going
all
the
way
with
you
if
you
give
me
any
trouble
and
if
you
do
answer
my
questions
i
might
tell
you
that
unless
this
interview
is
a
very
satisfactory
one
to
me
i
shall
not
only
arrest
doctor
van
heerden
but
i
shall
take
you
as
an
accomplice
you
ca
you
ca
she
almost
screamed
the
words
all
the
sullen
restraint
fell
away
from
her
and
she
was
electric
in
the
violence
of
her
protest
arrest
him
that
wonderful
man
arrest
me
you
dare
not
you
dare
not
i
shall
dare
do
lots
of
things
unless
you
tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
what
do
you
want
to
know
she
demanded
defiantly
i
want
to
know
the
most
likely
address
at
which
your
friend
the
doctor
can
be
found
the
fact
is
miss
glaum
the
game
is
up
we
know
all
about
the
green
rust
she
stepped
back
her
hand
raised
to
her
mouth
the
the
green
rust
she
gasped
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
doctor
van
heerden
is
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
against
this
state
he
has
disappeared
but
is
still
in
london
i
want
to
take
him
quietly
without
fuss
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
he
saw
doubt
rage
a
hint
of
fear
and
finally
a
steady
light
of
resolution
shining
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
calm
very
good
i
will
take
you
to
the
place
she
said
she
went
out
of
the
room
and
came
back
five
minutes
later
with
her
hat
and
coat
on
it
a
long
way
she
began
i
have
a
taxi
at
the
door
we
can
not
go
all
the
way
by
taxi
tell
the
man
to
drive
to
baker
street
she
said
she
spoke
no
word
during
the
journey
nor
was
beale
inclined
for
conversation
at
baker
street
station
they
stopped
and
the
cab
was
dismissed
together
they
walked
in
silence
turning
from
the
main
road
passing
the
central
station
and
plunging
into
a
labyrinth
of
streets
which
was
foreign
territory
to
the
american
it
seemed
that
he
had
passed
in
one
step
from
one
of
the
quarters
of
the
town
to
one
of
the
worst
one
minute
he
was
passing
through
a
sedate
square
lined
with
the
houses
of
the
another
minute
he
was
in
a
slum
the
place
is
at
the
end
of
this
street
she
said
they
came
to
what
seemed
to
be
a
there
was
a
blank
wall
with
one
door
and
a
pair
of
gates
the
girl
took
a
key
from
her
bag
opened
the
small
door
and
stepped
in
and
beale
followed
they
were
in
a
yard
littered
with
casks
on
two
sides
of
the
yard
ran
buildings
which
had
apparently
been
used
as
stables
she
locked
the
door
behind
her
walked
across
the
yard
to
the
corner
and
opened
another
door
there
are
fourteen
steps
down
she
said
have
you
a
light
of
any
kind
he
took
his
electric
torch
from
his
pocket
give
it
to
me
she
said
i
will
lead
the
way
what
is
this
place
he
asked
after
she
had
locked
the
door
it
used
to
be
a
wine
merchant
she
said
shortly
we
have
the
cellars
we
he
repeated
she
made
no
reply
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
was
a
short
passage
and
another
door
which
was
opened
and
apparently
the
same
key
fitted
them
all
or
else
as
beale
suspected
she
carried
a
pass
key
they
walked
through
and
again
she
closed
the
door
behind
them
another
he
said
as
her
light
flashed
upon
a
steel
door
a
dozen
paces
ahead
it
is
the
last
one
she
said
and
went
on
suddenly
the
light
was
extinguished
your
lamp
gone
wrong
he
heard
her
say
but
i
can
find
the
lock
he
heard
a
click
but
did
not
see
the
door
open
and
did
not
realize
what
had
happened
until
he
heard
a
click
again
the
light
was
suddenly
flashed
on
him
level
with
his
eyes
you
ca
see
me
said
a
mocking
voice
i
looking
at
you
through
the
little
did
you
see
the
clever
beale
and
i
am
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
he
heard
her
laugh
are
you
going
to
arrest
the
doctor
she
mocked
are
you
going
to
discover
the
secret
of
the
green
rust
ah
that
is
what
you
want
is
it
my
dear
little
friend
said
beale
smoothly
you
will
be
very
sensible
and
open
that
door
you
do
suppose
that
i
came
here
alone
i
was
shadowed
all
the
way
you
lie
she
said
coolly
why
did
i
dismiss
the
cab
and
make
you
walk
oh
clever
mr
beale
he
chuckled
though
he
was
in
no
chuckling
mood
what
a
sense
of
humour
he
said
admiringly
now
just
listen
to
me
he
made
one
stride
to
the
door
his
revolver
had
flicked
out
of
his
when
he
heard
the
snap
of
a
shutter
and
the
barrel
that
he
thrust
between
the
bars
met
steel
then
came
the
grind
of
bolts
and
he
pocketed
his
gun
so
that
that
he
said
then
he
walked
back
to
the
other
door
struck
a
match
and
examined
it
it
was
sheathed
with
iron
he
tapped
the
walls
with
his
stick
but
found
nothing
to
encourage
him
the
floor
was
solidly
flagged
the
low
roof
of
the
passage
was
vaulted
and
cased
with
stone
he
stopped
in
his
search
suddenly
and
listened
above
his
head
he
heard
a
light
patter
of
feet
and
smiled
it
was
his
boast
that
he
never
forgot
a
voice
or
a
footfall
that
my
little
friend
on
her
way
back
running
like
the
deuce
to
tell
the
doctor
he
said
i
have
something
under
an
hour
before
the
shooting
starts
chapter
xxiii
at
the
doctor
flat
van
heerden
did
not
hurry
his
departure
from
his
staines
house
he
spent
the
morning
following
oliva
marriage
in
town
transacting
certain
important
business
and
making
no
attempt
to
conceal
his
comings
and
goings
though
he
knew
that
he
was
shadowed
yet
he
was
well
aware
that
every
hour
that
passed
brought
danger
nearer
he
judged
and
rightly
that
his
peril
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
consequences
to
his
detention
of
oliva
cress
well
i
may
have
a
week
grace
he
said
to
milsom
and
in
the
space
of
a
week
i
can
do
all
that
i
want
he
spent
the
evening
superintending
the
dismantling
of
apparatus
in
the
shed
and
it
was
past
ten
on
tuesday
before
he
finished
it
was
not
until
he
was
seated
by
milsom
side
in
the
big
limousine
and
the
car
was
running
smoothly
through
kingston
that
he
made
any
further
reference
to
the
previous
afternoon
is
beale
content
he
asked
eh
milsom
dozing
in
the
corner
of
the
car
awoke
with
a
start
is
beale
content
with
his
prize
and
his
predicament
asked
van
heerden
well
i
guess
he
should
be
that
little
job
brings
him
a
million
he
should
worry
about
anything
further
but
van
heerden
shook
his
head
i
do
think
you
have
things
quite
right
milsom
he
said
beale
is
a
better
man
than
i
thought
and
knows
my
mind
a
little
too
well
he
was
astounded
when
homo
claimed
to
be
a
priest
i
never
saw
a
man
more
stunned
in
my
life
he
intended
the
marriage
as
a
bluff
to
keep
me
away
from
the
girl
he
analysed
the
situation
exactly
for
he
knew
i
was
after
her
money
and
that
she
as
a
woman
had
no
attraction
for
me
he
believed
and
there
he
was
justified
that
if
i
could
not
marry
her
i
had
no
interest
in
detaining
her
and
engaged
homo
to
follow
him
around
with
a
special
licence
he
timed
everything
too
well
for
my
comfort
milsom
shifted
round
and
peered
anxiously
at
his
companion
how
do
you
mean
he
asked
it
was
only
by
a
fluke
that
he
made
it
in
time
that
is
what
i
mean
it
is
the
fact
that
he
knew
that
every
second
was
vital
that
he
guessed
i
was
keen
on
a
quick
marriage
and
that
to
forestall
me
he
carried
his
as
he
thought
with
him
so
that
he
need
not
lose
a
minute
these
are
the
disturbing
factors
i
do
see
it
said
milsom
the
fellow
a
crook
all
these
yankee
detectives
are
grafters
he
saw
a
chance
of
a
big
rake
off
and
took
it
of
a
million
fortune
is
fine
commission
you
wrong
i
like
to
think
as
you
do
man
ca
you
see
that
his
every
action
proves
that
he
knows
all
about
the
green
rust
eh
milsom
sat
up
how
what
makes
you
say
that
it
clear
enough
he
has
already
some
idea
of
the
scheme
he
has
been
pumping
old
heyler
he
even
secured
a
sample
of
the
stuff
it
was
a
faulty
cultivation
but
it
might
have
been
enough
for
him
he
surmised
that
i
had
a
special
use
for
old
millinborn
money
and
why
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
it
the
silence
which
followed
lasted
several
minutes
does
anybody
except
beale
know
if
you
settled
him
we
should
have
to
finish
him
said
van
heerden
that
is
what
i
have
been
thinking
about
all
day
another
silence
well
why
not
asked
milsom
it
is
all
one
to
me
the
stake
is
worth
a
little
extra
risk
it
must
be
done
before
he
finds
the
paddington
place
that
is
the
danger
which
haunts
me
van
heerden
was
uneasy
and
he
had
lost
the
note
of
calm
assurance
which
ordinarily
characterized
his
speech
there
is
sufficient
evidence
there
to
spoil
everything
there
is
that
breathed
milsom
it
was
madness
to
go
on
you
have
all
the
stuff
you
want
you
could
have
closed
down
the
factory
a
week
ago
i
must
have
a
margin
of
safety
besides
how
could
i
do
anything
else
i
was
nearly
broke
and
any
sign
of
closing
down
would
have
brought
my
hungry
workers
to
krooman
mansions
that
true
agreed
the
other
i
had
to
stall
off
but
i
did
know
that
it
was
because
you
were
broke
it
seemed
to
me
just
a
natural
reluctance
to
part
with
good
money
further
conversation
was
arrested
by
the
sudden
stoppage
of
the
car
van
heerden
peered
through
the
window
ahead
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
red
lamp
it
is
all
right
he
said
this
must
be
putney
common
and
i
told
gregory
to
meet
me
with
any
news
a
man
came
into
the
rays
of
the
and
passed
to
the
door
well
asked
the
doctor
is
there
any
trouble
i
saw
the
green
lamp
on
the
bonnet
said
gregory
milsom
no
longer
wondered
how
the
man
had
recognized
the
car
from
the
score
of
others
which
pass
over
the
common
there
is
no
news
of
importance
where
is
beale
at
the
old
man
hotel
he
has
been
there
all
day
has
he
made
any
further
visits
to
the
police
he
was
at
scotland
yard
this
afternoon
and
the
young
lady
one
of
the
waiters
at
the
hotel
a
friend
of
mine
told
me
that
she
is
much
better
she
has
had
two
doctors
and
still
lives
said
the
cynical
milsom
that
makes
four
doctors
she
has
seen
in
two
days
van
heerden
leant
out
of
the
car
window
and
lowered
his
voice
the
fräulein
glaum
you
saw
her
yes
i
told
her
that
she
must
not
come
to
your
laboratory
again
until
you
sent
for
her
she
asked
when
you
leave
that
she
must
not
know
gregory
please
remember
he
withdrew
his
head
tapped
at
the
window
and
the
car
moved
on
there
another
problem
for
you
van
heerden
said
milsom
with
a
chuckle
what
demanded
the
other
sharply
hilda
glaum
i
only
seen
the
girl
twice
or
so
but
she
adores
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
her
van
heerden
lit
a
cigarette
and
in
the
play
of
the
flame
milsom
saw
him
smiling
she
comes
on
after
me
he
said
by
which
i
mean
that
i
have
a
place
for
her
in
my
country
but
not
not
the
sort
of
place
she
expects
finished
milsom
bluntly
you
may
have
trouble
there
bah
that
foolish
said
milsom
the
convict
establishments
of
england
are
filled
with
men
who
said
when
they
were
warned
against
jealous
women
if
he
went
on
if
you
could
eliminate
jealousy
from
the
human
outfit
you
have
half
the
prison
warders
of
england
unemployed
hilda
is
a
good
girl
said
the
other
complacently
she
is
also
a
good
german
girl
and
in
germany
women
know
their
place
in
the
system
she
will
be
satisfied
with
what
i
give
her
there
are
any
women
like
that
said
milsom
with
decision
and
the
subject
dropped
the
car
stopped
near
the
marble
arch
to
put
down
milsom
and
van
heerden
continued
his
journey
alone
reaching
his
apartments
a
little
before
midnight
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
car
a
man
strolled
across
the
street
it
was
beale
watcher
van
heerden
looked
round
with
a
smile
realizing
the
significance
of
this
nonchalant
figure
and
passed
through
the
lobby
and
up
the
stairs
he
had
left
his
lights
full
on
for
the
benefit
of
watchers
and
the
glowed
convincingly
through
the
fanlight
beale
flat
was
in
darkness
and
a
slip
of
paper
fastened
to
the
door
gave
his
address
the
doctor
let
himself
into
his
own
rooms
closed
the
door
switched
out
the
light
and
stepped
into
his
bureau
hello
he
said
angrily
what
are
you
doing
here
i
told
you
not
to
come
the
girl
who
was
sitting
at
the
table
and
who
now
rose
to
meet
him
was
breathless
and
he
read
trouble
in
her
face
he
could
have
read
pride
there
too
that
she
had
so
well
served
the
man
whom
she
idolized
as
a
god
i
got
him
i
got
him
julius
got
him
got
whom
he
asked
with
a
frown
beale
she
said
eagerly
the
great
beale
she
gurgled
with
hysterical
laughter
he
came
to
me
he
was
going
to
arrest
me
but
i
got
him
sit
down
he
said
firmly
and
try
to
be
coherent
hilda
who
came
to
you
beale
he
came
to
my
and
wanted
to
know
where
you
had
taken
oliva
cresswell
have
you
taken
her
she
asked
earnestly
go
on
he
said
he
came
to
me
full
of
arrogance
and
threats
he
was
going
to
have
me
arrested
julius
because
of
those
letters
which
i
gave
you
but
i
did
worry
about
myself
julius
it
was
all
for
you
that
i
thought
the
thought
that
you
my
dear
great
man
should
be
put
in
one
of
these
horrible
english
prisons
oh
julius
she
rose
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
he
stood
over
her
laid
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
pressed
her
back
now
now
you
must
tell
me
everything
this
is
very
serious
what
happened
then
he
wanted
me
to
take
him
to
one
of
the
places
one
of
what
places
he
asked
quickly
i
do
know
he
only
said
that
he
knew
that
you
had
other
houses
i
do
even
know
that
he
said
that
but
that
was
the
impression
that
he
gave
me
that
he
knew
you
were
to
be
found
somewhere
go
on
said
the
doctor
and
so
i
thought
and
i
thought
said
the
girl
her
hands
clasped
in
front
of
her
her
eyes
looking
up
into
his
and
i
prayed
god
would
give
me
some
idea
to
help
you
and
then
the
scheme
came
to
me
julius
i
said
i
would
lead
him
to
you
you
said
you
would
lead
him
to
me
he
said
steadily
and
where
did
you
lead
him
to
the
factory
in
paddington
she
said
there
he
stared
at
her
wait
wait
wait
she
said
oh
please
do
blame
me
i
took
him
into
the
passage
with
the
doors
i
borrowed
his
light
and
after
we
had
passed
and
locked
the
second
door
i
slipped
through
the
third
and
slammed
it
in
his
face
then
he
is
there
caught
oh
julius
did
i
do
well
please
do
be
angry
with
me
i
was
so
afraid
for
you
how
long
have
you
been
here
he
asked
not
ten
minutes
perhaps
five
minutes
i
do
know
i
have
no
knowledge
of
time
i
came
straight
back
to
see
you
he
stood
by
the
table
gnawing
his
finger
his
head
bowed
in
concentrated
thought
there
of
all
places
he
muttered
there
of
all
places
oh
julius
i
did
my
best
she
said
tearfully
he
looked
down
at
her
with
a
little
sneer
of
course
you
did
your
best
you
a
woman
and
you
have
brains
i
thought
you
thought
he
sneered
who
told
you
you
could
think
you
fool
do
you
know
it
was
a
bluff
that
he
could
no
more
arrest
me
than
i
could
arrest
him
do
you
realize
did
he
know
you
were
in
the
habit
of
coming
here
she
nodded
i
thought
so
said
van
heerden
with
a
bitter
laugh
he
knows
you
are
in
love
with
me
and
he
played
upon
your
fears
you
poor
little
fool
do
cry
or
i
shall
do
something
unpleasant
there
there
help
yourself
to
some
wine
you
find
it
in
the
tantalus
he
strode
up
and
down
the
room
there
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
settle
accounts
with
beale
he
said
grimly
do
you
think
he
was
watched
oh
no
no
julius
she
checked
her
sobs
i
was
so
careful
she
gave
him
a
description
of
the
journey
and
the
precautions
she
had
taken
well
perhaps
you
not
such
a
fool
after
all
he
unlocked
a
drawer
in
his
desk
and
took
out
a
browning
pistol
withdrew
the
magazine
from
the
butt
examined
and
replaced
it
and
slipped
back
the
cover
yes
i
think
i
must
settle
accounts
with
this
gentleman
but
i
want
to
use
this
he
added
thoughtfully
as
he
pushed
up
the
and
dropped
the
weapon
in
his
pocket
we
might
be
able
to
gas
him
anyway
you
can
do
no
more
good
or
harm
he
said
cynically
she
was
speechless
her
hands
clasped
tightly
at
her
breast
covered
a
damp
ball
of
handkerchief
and
her
face
was
upturned
to
his
now
dry
your
face
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
lightly
on
the
cheek
perhaps
what
you
have
done
is
the
best
after
all
who
knows
anyway
he
said
speaking
his
thoughts
aloud
beale
knows
about
the
green
rust
and
it
ca
be
very
long
before
i
have
to
go
to
earth
but
only
for
a
little
time
my
hilda
he
smiled
showing
his
white
teeth
but
it
was
not
a
pleasant
smile
only
for
a
little
time
and
then
he
threw
up
his
arms
we
shall
be
rich
beyond
the
dreams
of
frankfurt
you
will
succeed
i
know
you
will
succeed
julius
she
breathed
if
i
could
only
help
you
if
you
would
only
tell
me
what
you
are
doing
what
is
the
green
rust
is
it
some
wonderful
new
explosive
dry
your
face
and
go
home
he
said
shortly
you
will
find
a
detective
outside
the
door
watching
you
but
i
do
not
think
he
will
follow
you
he
dismissed
the
girl
and
followed
her
after
an
interval
of
time
striding
boldly
past
the
shadow
and
gaining
the
in
shaftesbury
avenue
without
so
far
as
he
could
see
being
followed
but
he
dismissed
the
cab
in
the
neighbourhood
of
baker
street
and
continued
his
journey
on
foot
he
opened
the
little
door
leading
into
the
yard
but
did
not
follow
the
same
direction
as
the
girl
had
led
stanford
beale
it
was
through
another
door
that
he
entered
the
vault
which
at
one
time
had
been
the
innocent
repository
of
bubbling
life
and
was
now
the
factory
where
men
worked
diligently
for
the
destruction
of
their
fellows
chapter
xxiv
the
green
rust
factory
stanford
beale
spent
a
thoughtful
three
minutes
in
the
darkness
of
the
cellar
passage
to
which
hilda
glaum
had
led
him
and
then
he
began
a
careful
search
of
his
pockets
he
carried
a
little
silver
which
had
fortunately
been
charged
with
petrol
that
afternoon
and
this
afforded
him
a
beam
of
adequate
means
to
take
note
of
his
surroundings
the
space
between
the
two
locked
doors
was
ten
feet
the
width
of
the
passage
three
the
height
about
seven
feet
the
roof
as
he
had
already
noted
was
vaulted
now
he
saw
that
along
the
centre
ran
a
strip
of
beading
there
had
evidently
been
an
electric
light
installation
here
probably
before
the
new
owners
took
possession
for
at
intervals
was
a
socket
for
an
electric
bulb
the
new
occupants
had
covered
these
and
the
rest
of
the
wall
with
whitewash
and
yet
the
beading
and
the
electric
fittings
looked
comparatively
new
one
wall
that
on
his
left
as
he
had
come
in
revealed
nothing
under
his
close
inspection
but
on
the
right
wall
midway
between
the
two
doors
there
had
been
a
notice
painted
in
white
letters
on
a
black
background
and
this
showed
faintly
through
the
thick
coating
of
distemper
which
had
been
applied
he
damped
a
handkerchief
with
his
tongue
and
rubbed
away
some
of
the
whitewash
where
the
letters
were
least
legible
and
read
aid
lter
ulance
t
aid
this
was
evidently
half
an
inscription
which
had
been
cut
off
exactly
in
the
middle
to
the
left
there
was
no
sign
of
lettering
he
puzzled
the
letters
for
a
few
moments
before
he
came
to
an
understanding
shelter
ambulance
and
first
aid
he
read
so
that
explained
the
new
electric
fittings
it
was
one
of
those
underground
cellars
which
had
been
ferreted
out
by
the
municipality
or
the
government
for
the
shelter
of
the
people
in
the
neighbourhood
during
in
the
great
war
evidently
there
was
extensive
accommodation
here
since
this
was
also
an
ambulance
post
faintly
discernible
beneath
the
letters
was
a
painted
white
hand
which
pointed
downward
what
had
happened
to
the
other
half
of
the
inscription
obviously
it
had
been
painted
on
the
door
leading
into
the
room
and
as
obviously
that
door
had
been
removed
and
had
been
bricked
up
in
the
light
of
this
discovery
he
made
a
more
careful
inspection
of
the
wall
to
the
left
for
the
space
of
four
feet
the
brickwork
was
new
he
tapped
it
it
sounded
hollow
pressing
his
back
against
the
opposite
wall
to
give
him
leverage
he
put
his
foot
against
the
new
brickwork
and
pushed
he
knew
that
the
class
of
workmanship
which
was
put
into
this
kind
of
job
was
not
of
the
best
that
only
one
layer
of
brick
was
applied
and
it
was
a
mechanical
fact
that
pressure
applied
to
the
centre
of
new
work
would
produce
a
collapse
at
the
first
push
he
felt
the
wall
sag
releasing
his
pressure
it
came
back
this
time
he
put
both
feet
against
the
wall
and
bracing
his
shoulders
he
put
every
ounce
of
strength
in
his
body
into
a
mighty
heave
the
next
second
he
was
lying
on
his
back
the
greater
part
of
the
wall
had
collapsed
he
was
curious
enough
to
examine
the
work
he
had
demolished
it
had
evidently
been
done
by
amateurs
and
the
whitewash
which
had
been
thickly
applied
to
the
passage
was
explained
a
current
of
fresh
air
came
to
meet
him
as
he
stepped
gingerly
across
the
debris
a
flight
of
six
stone
steps
led
down
to
a
small
room
containing
a
sink
and
a
water
supply
two
camp
beds
which
had
evidently
been
part
of
the
ambulance
equipment
and
which
the
new
owners
had
not
thought
necessary
to
remove
and
a
broken
chair
the
room
was
still
littered
with
the
paraphernalia
of
he
found
odd
ends
of
bandages
empty
medicine
bottles
and
a
broken
glass
measure
on
the
shelf
above
the
sink
what
interested
him
more
was
a
door
which
he
had
not
dared
to
hope
he
would
find
it
was
bolted
on
his
side
and
when
he
had
slid
this
back
he
discovered
to
his
relief
that
it
was
not
locked
he
opened
it
carefully
first
extinguishing
his
light
beyond
the
door
was
darkness
and
he
snapped
back
the
light
again
the
room
led
to
another
likewise
empty
there
were
a
number
of
shelves
a
few
old
a
score
of
empty
bottles
but
nothing
else
at
the
far
corner
was
yet
another
door
also
bolted
on
the
inside
evidently
van
heerden
did
not
intend
this
part
of
the
vault
to
be
used
he
looked
at
the
lock
and
found
it
was
broken
he
must
be
approaching
the
main
workroom
in
this
new
factory
and
it
was
necessary
to
proceed
with
caution
he
took
out
his
revolver
spun
the
cylinder
and
thrust
it
under
his
waistcoat
the
butt
ready
to
his
hand
the
drawing
of
the
bolts
was
a
long
business
he
could
not
afford
to
risk
detection
at
this
hour
and
could
only
move
them
by
a
fraction
of
an
inch
at
a
time
presently
his
work
was
done
and
he
pulled
the
door
cautiously
instantly
there
appeared
between
door
and
jamb
a
bright
green
line
of
light
he
dare
not
move
it
any
farther
for
he
heard
now
the
shuffle
of
feet
and
occasionally
the
sound
of
hollow
voices
muffled
and
indistinguishable
in
that
light
the
opening
of
the
door
would
be
seen
perhaps
by
a
dozen
pair
of
eyes
for
all
he
knew
every
man
in
that
room
might
be
facing
his
way
he
had
expected
to
hear
the
noise
of
machinery
but
beyond
the
strangled
voices
occasionally
the
click
of
glass
against
glass
and
the
of
slippered
feet
crossing
the
floor
he
heard
nothing
he
pulled
the
door
another
quarter
of
an
inch
and
glued
his
eye
to
the
crack
at
this
angle
he
could
only
see
one
of
the
walls
of
the
big
vault
and
the
end
of
a
long
which
stood
in
one
of
the
cornices
and
which
supplied
the
ghastly
light
but
presently
he
saw
something
which
filled
him
with
hope
against
the
wall
was
a
high
shadow
which
even
the
overhead
lamp
did
not
wholly
neutralize
it
was
an
irregular
shadow
such
as
a
stack
of
boxes
might
make
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
perhaps
beyond
his
range
of
vision
there
was
a
barricade
of
empty
cases
which
hid
the
door
from
the
rest
of
the
room
he
spent
nearly
of
an
hour
taking
a
bearing
based
upon
the
problematical
position
of
the
lights
the
height
and
density
of
the
box
screen
and
then
boldly
and
rapidly
opened
the
door
stepped
through
and
closed
it
behind
him
his
calculations
had
been
accurate
he
found
himself
in
a
room
the
extent
of
which
he
could
only
conjecture
what
however
interested
him
mostly
was
the
accuracy
of
his
calculation
that
the
door
was
hidden
an
l
stack
of
crates
was
piled
within
two
feet
of
the
ceiling
and
formed
a
little
lobby
to
anybody
entering
the
vault
the
way
beale
had
come
they
were
stacked
neatly
and
methodically
and
with
the
exception
of
two
larger
which
formed
the
corner
stone
the
barrier
was
made
of
a
large
number
of
small
boxes
about
ten
inches
square
there
was
a
small
evidently
used
by
the
person
whose
business
it
was
to
keep
this
stack
in
order
beale
lifted
it
noiselessly
planted
it
against
the
corner
and
mounted
cautiously
he
saw
a
large
broad
chamber
its
groined
roof
supported
by
six
squat
stone
pillars
light
came
not
only
from
mercurial
lamps
affixed
to
the
ceiling
but
from
others
suspended
above
the
three
rows
of
benches
which
ran
the
length
of
the
room
mercurial
lamps
do
not
give
a
green
light
as
he
knew
but
a
violet
light
and
the
green
effect
was
produced
by
shades
of
something
which
beale
thought
was
yellow
silk
but
which
he
afterwards
discovered
was
tinted
mica
at
intervals
along
the
benches
sat
figures
their
faces
hidden
behind
rubber
masks
their
hands
covered
with
gloves
in
front
of
each
man
was
a
small
microscope
under
a
glass
shade
a
pair
of
balances
and
a
rack
filled
with
shallow
porcelain
trays
evidently
the
work
on
which
they
were
engaged
did
not
endanger
their
eyesight
for
the
in
the
masks
were
innocent
of
protective
covering
a
circumstance
which
added
to
the
hideous
appearance
of
the
men
they
all
looked
alike
in
their
uniform
garb
but
one
figure
alone
beale
recognized
there
was
no
mistaking
the
stumpy
form
and
the
big
head
of
the
herr
professor
whose
appearance
in
oliva
cresswell
room
had
so
terrified
that
young
lady
he
had
expected
to
see
him
for
he
knew
that
this
old
german
and
had
been
roped
in
by
van
heerden
and
beale
who
pitied
the
old
man
had
been
engaged
for
a
fortnight
in
trying
to
worm
from
the
of
chemistry
at
the
university
of
heidelberg
the
location
of
van
heerden
secret
laboratory
his
efforts
had
been
unsuccessful
there
was
a
streak
of
loyalty
in
the
old
man
which
had
excited
an
irritable
admiration
in
the
detective
but
had
produced
nothing
more
beale
eyes
followed
the
benches
and
took
in
every
detail
some
of
the
men
were
evidently
engaged
in
tests
and
remained
all
the
time
with
their
eyes
glued
to
their
microscopes
others
were
looking
into
their
porcelain
trays
and
stirring
the
contents
with
glass
rods
now
and
again
transferring
something
to
a
glass
slide
which
was
placed
on
the
microscope
and
earnestly
examined
beale
was
conscious
of
a
faint
musty
odour
permeating
the
air
an
indescribable
earthy
smell
with
a
tang
to
it
which
made
the
delicate
membrane
of
the
nostrils
smart
and
ache
he
tied
his
handkerchief
over
his
nose
and
mouth
before
he
took
another
peep
only
part
of
the
room
was
visible
from
his
post
of
observation
what
was
going
on
immediately
beneath
the
far
side
of
the
screen
he
could
only
conjecture
but
he
saw
enough
to
convince
him
that
this
was
the
principal
factory
from
whence
van
heerden
was
distilling
the
poison
with
which
he
planned
death
some
of
the
workers
were
filling
and
sealing
small
with
the
contents
of
dishes
these
tubes
were
extraordinarily
delicate
of
structure
and
beale
saw
at
least
three
crumble
and
shiver
in
the
hands
of
the
fillers
every
bench
held
a
hundred
or
so
of
these
tubes
and
a
covered
for
heating
the
wax
the
work
went
on
methodically
with
very
little
conversation
between
the
masked
figures
he
saw
that
the
masks
covered
the
heads
of
the
chemists
so
that
not
a
vestige
of
hair
showed
and
only
occasionally
did
one
of
them
leave
his
seat
and
disappear
through
a
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
which
apparently
led
to
a
canteen
evidently
the
fumes
against
which
they
were
protected
were
not
virulent
for
some
of
the
men
stripped
their
masks
as
soon
as
they
left
their
benches
for
half
an
hour
he
watched
and
in
the
course
of
that
time
saw
the
process
of
filling
the
small
boxes
which
formed
his
barrier
and
with
the
sealed
tubes
he
observed
the
care
with
which
the
fragile
tubes
were
placed
in
their
beds
of
cotton
wool
and
had
a
glimpse
of
the
lined
interior
of
one
of
the
boxes
he
was
on
the
point
of
lifting
down
a
box
to
make
a
more
thorough
examination
when
he
heard
a
quavering
voice
beneath
him
what
you
do
here
eh
under
the
was
one
of
the
workers
who
had
slipped
noiselessly
round
the
corner
of
the
pile
and
now
stood
grotesque
and
menacing
his
uncovered
eyes
glowering
at
the
intruder
the
black
barrel
of
his
browning
pistol
covering
the
detective
heart
do
shoot
colonel
said
beale
softly
i
come
down
chapter
xxv
the
last
man
at
the
bench
after
all
it
was
for
the
best
van
heerden
could
almost
see
the
hand
of
providence
in
this
deliverance
of
his
enemy
into
his
power
there
must
be
a
settlement
with
beale
that
drunkard
who
had
so
deceived
him
at
first
van
heerden
could
admire
the
ingenuity
of
his
enemy
and
could
kill
him
he
was
a
man
whose
mental
poise
permitted
the
paradox
of
detached
attachments
at
first
he
had
regarded
stanford
beale
as
a
smart
police
officer
the
sort
of
man
whom
pinkerton
and
burns
turn
out
by
the
score
shrewd
assertive
indefatigable
such
men
piece
together
the
scattered
mosaics
of
humdrum
crimes
and
by
their
mechanical
patience
produce
for
the
satisfaction
of
courts
sufficient
of
the
piece
to
reveal
the
design
they
figure
in
divorce
suits
in
financial
swindles
and
occasionally
in
more
serious
cases
van
heerden
knew
instinctively
their
limitations
and
had
too
hastily
placed
beale
in
a
lower
category
than
he
deserved
van
heerden
came
to
his
workroom
by
way
of
the
buffet
which
he
had
established
for
the
use
of
his
employees
as
he
shut
the
steel
door
behind
him
he
saw
milsom
standing
at
the
rough
wooden
sideboard
which
served
as
bar
and
table
for
the
workers
this
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
said
milsom
and
then
quickly
as
he
read
the
other
face
anything
wrong
if
the
fact
that
the
cleverest
policeman
in
america
or
england
is
at
present
on
the
premises
can
be
so
described
then
everything
is
wrong
said
van
heerden
and
helped
himself
to
a
drink
here
in
the
laboratory
demanded
milsom
fear
in
his
eyes
what
do
you
mean
i
tell
you
said
the
other
and
gave
the
story
as
he
had
heard
it
from
hilda
glaum
he
in
the
old
passage
eh
said
milsom
thoughtfully
well
no
reason
why
he
should
get
out
alive
he
wo
said
the
other
was
he
followed
you
saw
nobody
outside
we
have
nothing
to
fear
on
that
score
he
working
on
his
own
milsom
grunted
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
him
gas
him
said
van
heerden
he
is
certain
to
have
a
gun
milsom
nodded
wait
until
the
men
have
gone
i
let
them
go
at
three
a
few
at
a
time
and
it
wants
half
an
hour
to
that
he
can
wait
he
safe
where
he
is
why
did
hilda
tell
me
i
never
even
saw
her
she
went
straight
up
from
the
old
passage
through
the
men
door
she
did
trust
you
probably
milsom
smiled
wryly
though
he
controlled
these
works
and
knew
half
the
doctor
secrets
he
suspected
that
the
quantity
of
van
heerden
trust
was
not
greatly
in
excess
of
his
girl
we
wait
he
said
again
there
no
hurry
and
anyway
i
want
to
see
you
about
old
man
heyler
von
heyler
i
thought
you
were
rid
of
him
said
van
heerden
in
surprise
that
is
the
old
fool
that
beale
has
been
after
he
has
been
trying
to
suck
him
dry
and
has
had
two
interviews
with
him
i
told
you
to
send
him
to
deans
folly
bridgers
would
have
taken
care
of
him
bridgers
can
look
after
nothing
said
milsom
his
eyes
roved
along
the
benches
and
stopped
at
a
worker
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
he
quiet
he
said
that
fellow
is
too
full
of
himself
for
my
liking
earlier
in
the
evening
before
i
arrived
he
pulled
a
gun
on
schultz
he
too
full
of
gunplay
that
fellow
excuse
the
idiom
but
i
was
in
the
same
tailor
shop
at
portland
gaol
as
ned
garrand
the
yankee
van
heerden
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
about
old
heyler
milsom
went
on
i
know
you
think
he
dangerous
so
i
kept
him
here
there
a
room
where
he
can
sleep
and
he
can
take
all
the
exercise
he
wants
at
night
but
the
old
fool
is
restless
he
been
asking
me
what
is
the
object
of
his
work
he
difficult
twice
he
has
nearly
betrayed
me
as
i
told
you
in
the
car
i
gave
him
some
experimental
work
to
do
and
he
brought
the
result
to
me
that
was
the
sample
which
fell
into
beale
hands
beale
is
certainly
a
danger
said
milsom
thoughtfully
van
heerden
made
a
move
toward
the
laboratory
but
milsom
big
hand
detained
him
one
minute
van
heerden
he
said
whilst
you
here
you
better
decide
when
do
we
start
dismantling
i
got
to
find
some
excuse
to
send
these
fellows
away
van
heerden
thought
in
two
days
he
said
that
will
give
you
time
to
clear
you
can
send
the
men
well
send
them
to
scotland
some
place
where
news
does
travel
tell
them
we
opening
a
new
factory
and
put
them
up
at
the
local
hotel
milsom
inclined
his
head
that
sounds
easy
he
said
i
could
take
charge
of
them
until
the
time
came
to
skip
one
can
get
a
boat
at
greenock
i
shall
miss
you
said
van
heerden
frankly
you
were
necessary
to
me
milsom
you
the
driving
force
i
wanted
and
the
only
man
of
my
class
and
calibre
i
can
ever
expect
to
meet
one
who
would
go
into
this
business
with
me
they
had
reached
the
big
vault
and
van
heerden
stood
regarding
the
scene
of
mental
activity
with
something
approaching
complacency
there
is
a
billion
in
process
of
creation
he
said
i
could
never
think
in
more
than
six
figures
said
milsom
and
it
is
only
under
your
cheering
influence
that
i
can
stretch
to
seven
i
am
going
to
live
in
the
argentine
van
heerden
a
house
on
a
hill
the
other
shivered
but
milsom
went
on
a
gorgeous
palace
of
a
house
alive
with
servants
a
string
band
a
perfectly
equipped
laboratory
where
i
can
indulge
my
passion
for
research
a
auto
wine
of
the
rarest
ah
van
heerden
looked
at
his
companion
curiously
that
appeals
to
you
does
it
for
me
the
control
of
finance
endless
schemes
of
fortune
endless
smashings
of
rivals
railways
ships
great
industries
juggled
and
shuffled
that
is
the
life
i
plan
fine
said
the
other
laconically
they
walked
to
a
bench
and
the
worker
looked
up
and
took
off
his
mask
he
was
an
old
man
and
grinned
toothlessly
at
van
heerden
good
evening
signor
doctor
he
said
in
italian
science
is
long
and
life
is
short
signor
he
chuckled
and
resuming
his
mask
returned
to
his
work
ignoring
the
two
men
as
though
they
had
no
existence
a
little
mad
old
castelli
said
milsom
that
his
one
little
piece
what
crooked
thing
has
he
done
none
that
i
know
said
the
other
carelessly
he
lost
his
wife
and
two
daughters
in
the
messina
earthquake
i
picked
him
up
cheap
he
a
useful
chemist
they
walked
from
bench
to
bench
but
van
heerden
eyes
continuously
strayed
to
the
door
behind
which
he
pictured
a
caged
stanford
beale
awaiting
his
doom
the
men
were
beginning
to
depart
now
one
by
one
they
covered
their
instruments
and
their
trays
slipped
off
their
masks
and
overalls
and
disappeared
through
the
door
upon
which
van
heerden
gaze
was
so
often
fixed
their
exit
however
would
not
take
them
near
beale
prison
a
few
paces
along
the
corridor
was
another
passage
leading
to
the
yard
above
and
it
was
by
this
way
that
hilda
glaum
had
sped
to
the
doctor
room
presently
all
were
gone
save
one
industrious
worker
who
sat
peering
through
the
of
his
microscope
immovable
that
our
friend
bridgers
said
milsom
he
all
lit
up
with
the
alkaloid
of
well
bridgers
nearly
finished
huh
grunted
the
man
without
turning
milsom
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
must
let
him
finish
what
he
doing
he
is
quite
oblivious
to
the
presence
of
anybody
when
he
has
these
fits
of
industry
by
the
way
the
passing
of
our
dear
enemy
he
jerked
his
head
to
the
passage
door
will
make
no
change
in
your
plans
how
you
have
no
great
anxiety
to
marry
the
widow
none
said
the
doctor
and
she
is
a
widow
yet
it
was
not
milsom
who
spoke
but
the
man
at
the
bench
the
industrious
worker
whose
eye
was
still
at
the
microscope
keep
your
comments
to
yourself
said
van
heerden
angrily
finish
your
work
and
get
out
i
finished
the
worker
rose
slowly
and
loosening
the
tapes
of
his
mask
pulled
it
off
my
name
is
beale
he
said
calmly
i
think
we
met
before
move
milsom
unless
you
want
to
save
i
a
fairly
quick
shot
when
i
annoyed
stanford
beale
pushed
back
the
microscope
and
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
bench
you
addressed
me
as
bridgers
he
said
you
will
find
bridgers
in
a
room
behind
that
stack
of
boxes
the
fact
is
he
surprised
me
spying
and
was
all
for
shooting
me
up
but
i
induced
him
to
come
into
my
private
office
so
to
speak
and
the
rest
was
easy
he
dopes
he
he
had
the
strength
of
a
rat
however
that
is
all
beside
the
point
van
heerden
what
have
you
to
say
against
my
arresting
you
out
of
hand
on
a
conspiracy
charge
van
heerden
smiled
contemptuously
there
are
many
things
i
can
say
he
said
in
the
first
place
you
have
no
authority
to
arrest
anybody
you
not
a
police
officer
but
only
an
american
amateur
american
yes
but
amateur
no
said
beale
gently
as
to
the
authority
why
i
guess
i
can
arrest
you
first
and
get
the
authority
after
on
what
charge
demanded
milsom
there
is
nothing
secret
about
this
place
except
doctor
van
heerden
association
with
it
a
professional
man
is
debarred
from
mixing
in
commercial
affairs
is
it
a
crime
to
run
a
he
looked
to
van
heerden
a
germicide
factory
said
van
heerden
promptly
suppose
i
know
the
character
of
this
laboratory
asked
beale
quietly
carry
that
kind
of
story
to
the
police
and
see
what
steps
they
will
take
said
van
heerden
scornfully
my
dear
beale
as
i
have
told
you
once
before
you
have
been
reading
too
much
exciting
detective
fiction
very
likely
he
said
but
anyhow
the
little
story
that
enthralls
me
just
now
is
called
the
green
terror
and
i
looking
to
you
to
supply
a
few
of
the
missing
pages
and
i
think
you
do
it
the
doctor
was
lighting
a
cigarette
and
he
looked
at
the
other
over
the
flaring
match
with
a
gleam
of
malicious
amusement
in
his
eyes
your
romantic
fancies
would
exasperate
me
but
for
your
evident
sincerity
having
stolen
my
bride
you
seem
anxious
to
steal
my
reputation

mockingly

off
the
bench
and
standing
hands
on
hips
before
the
doctor
would
take
a
bit
of
finding
i
tell
you
van
heerden
that
i
going
to
call
your
bluff
i
shall
place
this
factory
in
the
hands
of
the
police

i
am
going
to
call
in
the
greatest
scientists
in
england

to
prove
the

i
shall
make
against
you

he
held
up
between
his
forefinger
and
thumb
a
crystal
tube
filled
to
its
seal
with
something
that
looked
like
green
sawdust
the

the
sceptical
world
shall
know
the
hell
you
are
preparing
for
them
stanford
beale
voice
trembled
with
passion
and
his
face
was
dark
with
the
thought
of
a
crime
so
monstrous
that
even
the
outrageous
treatment
of
a
woman
who
was
more
to
him
than
all
the
world
was
for
the
moment
obliterated
from
his
mind
in
the
contemplation
of
the
danger
which
threatened
humanity
you
say
that
the
police
and
even
the
government
of
this
country
will
dismiss
my
charge
as
being
too
fantastic
for
belief
you
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
you
are
right
they
think
i
am
mad
but
i
will
convince
them
in
this

the
destruction
of
all
your
fondest
dreams

to
realize
those
dreams
you
have
murdered
two
men
for
these
you
killed

and
the

explosion

thunderously

chapter

the
secret
of
the
green
rust
a
dishevelled
figure
stood
by
the
boxes
revolver
in
hand
it
was
bridgers
the
man
he
had
left
strapped
and
bound
in
the
and
beale
cursed
the
folly
which
had
induced
him
to
leave
the
revolver
behind
i
fix
you
you
brute
screamed
bridgers
get
away
from
him
ah
beale
hand
flew
up
a
pencil
of
flame
quivered
and
again
the
vault
trembled
to
the
deafening
report
but
bridgers
had
dropped
to
cover
again
he
shot
this
time
with
unexpected
effect
the
bullet
struck
the
on
the
opposite
wall
and
all
the
lights
went
out
beale
was
still
holding
the
glass
tube
and
this
milsom
had
seen
quick
as
thought
he
hurled
himself
upon
the
detective
his
big
powerful
hands
gripped
the
other
wrist
and
wrenched
it
round
beale
set
his
teeth
and
manoeuvred
for
a
lock
grip
but
he
was
badly
placed
pressed
as
he
was
against
the
edge
of
the
bench
he
felt
van
heerden
fingers
clawing
at
his
hand
and
the
tube
was
torn
away
then
somebody
pulled
the
revolver
from
the
other
hand
and
there
was
a
scamper
of
feet
he
groped
his
way
through
the
blackness
and
ran
into
the
pile
of
boxes
a
bullet
whizzed
past
him
from
the
bridgers
but
that
was
a
risk
he
had
to
take
he
heard
the
squeak
of
an
opening
door
and
stumbled
blindly
in
its
direction
presently
he
found
it
he
had
watched
the
other
men
go
out
and
discovered
the
steps
two
minutes
later
he
was
in
the
street
there
was
no
sign
of
either
of
the
two
men
he
found
a
policeman
after
he
had
walked
half
a
mile
but
that
intelligent
officer
could
not
leave
his
beat
and
advised
him
to
go
to
the
police
station
it
was
an
excellent
suggestion
for
although
the
sergeant
on
duty
was
wholly
unresponsive
there
was
a
telephone
and
at
the
end
of
the
telephone
in
his
little
haymarket
flat
a
superintendent
mcnorton
the
mention
of
whose
very
name
galvanized
the
police
office
to
activity
i
have
found
the
factory
i
been
looking
for
mcnorton
said
beale
i
explain
the
whole
thing
to
you
in
the
morning
what
i
want
now
is
a
search
made
of
the
premises
we
ca
do
that
without
a
magistrate
warrant
said
voice
but
what
we
can
do
is
to
guard
the
premises
until
the
warrant
is
obtained
ask
the
station
sergeant
to
speak
on
the
by
the
way
how
is
miss
cresswell
better
i
hope
much
better
said
the
young
man
shortly
it
was
unbelievable
that
she
could
ever
fill
his
heart
with
the
ache
which
came
at
the
mention
of
her
name
he
made
way
for
the
station
sergeant
and
later
accompanied
four
men
back
to
the
laboratory
they
found
all
the
doors
closed
beale
scaled
the
wall
but
failed
to
find
a
way
in
he
rejoined
the
sergeant
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
what
is
the
name
of
this
street
he
asked
playbury
street
sir
this
used
to
be
henderson
wine
vaults
in
my
younger
days
beale
jotted
down
the
address
and
finding
a
taxi
drove
back
to
the
police
station
wearied
and
sick
at
heart
he
arrived
in
time
to
be
a
witness
to
a
curious
scene
in
the
centre
of
the
and
facing
the
sergeant
desk
was
a
man
of
middle
age
shabbily
dressed
but
bearing
the
indefinable
air
of
one
who
had
seen
better
days
the
grey
hair
was
carefully
brushed
from
the
familiar
face
and
gave
him
that
venerable
appearance
which
pale
eyes
and
a
pair
of
thin
straight
lips
curled
now
in
an
amused
smile
did
their
best
to
discount
by
his
side
stood
his
captor
a
station
detective
a
bored
and
apathetic
man
it
seems
the
prisoner
was
saying
as
stanford
beale
came
noiselessly
into
the
room
it
seems
that
under
this
detestable
system
of
police
espionage
a
fellow
may
not
even
take
a
walk
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
his
voice
was
that
of
an
educated
man
his
drawling
address
spoke
of
his
confidence
now
look
here
parson
said
the
station
sergeant
in
that
friendly
tone
which
the
police
adopt
when
dealing
with
their
pet
criminals
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
under
the
prevention
of
crimes
act
you
an
old
lag
are
liable
to
be
arrested
if
you
are
seen
in
any
suspicious
circumstances
you
ought
to
be
wandering
about
the
streets
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
if
you
do
why
you
must
kick
because
pinched
anything
found
on
him
smith
no
sergeant
he
was
just
mouching
round
so
i
pulled
him
in
where
are
you
living
now
parson
the
man
with
extravagant
care
searched
his
pockets
i
have
inadvertently
left
my
with
my
coiner
outfit
he
said
gravely
but
a
wire
addressed
to
the
doss
house
mine
street
paddington
will
find
me
but
i
do
think
i
should
try
at
this
moment
i
enjoy
the
protection
of
the
law
in
four
days
time
i
shall
be
on
the
ocean
why
mr
beale
beale
smiled
hullo
parson
i
thought
you
had
sailed
the
berths
are
all
taken
and
i
will
not
travel
to
australia
with
the
common
herd
he
turned
to
the
astonished
sergeant
can
i
go
beale
will
vouch
for
me
as
he
left
the
he
beckoned
the
detective
and
when
they
were
together
in
the
street
beale
found
that
all
the
parson
flippancy
had
departed
i
sorry
i
got
you
into
that
scrape
he
said
seriously
i
ought
to
have
been
unfrocked
but
i
was
sentenced
for
my
first
crime
under
an
assumed
name
i
was
not
attached
to
any
church
at
the
time
and
my
identity
has
never
been
discovered
beale
he
went
on
with
a
quizzical
smile
i
have
yet
to
commit
my
ideal
crime
the
murder
of
a
bishop
who
allows
a
curate
to
marry
a
wife
on
sixty
pounds
a
year
his
face
darkened
and
beale
found
himself
wondering
at
the
contents
of
the
tragic
years
behind
the
man
where
was
the
wife
but
my
private
grievances
against
the
world
will
not
interest
you
parson
homo
resumed
i
only
called
you
out
to
well
to
ask
your
pardon
it
was
my
own
fault
homo
said
beale
quietly
and
held
out
his
hand
good
luck
there
may
be
a
life
for
you
in
the
new
land
he
stood
till
the
figure
passed
out
of
sight
then
turned
wearily
toward
his
own
rooms
he
went
to
his
room
and
lay
down
on
his
bed
fully
dressed
he
was
aroused
from
a
troubled
sleep
by
the
jangle
of
the
it
was
mcnorton
come
down
to
scotland
house
and
see
the
he
said
he
is
very
anxious
to
hear
more
about
this
factory
he
tells
me
that
you
have
already
given
him
an
outline
of
the
plot
yes
i
give
you
details
i
be
with
you
in
half
an
hour
he
had
a
bath
and
changed
his
clothes
and
breakfastless
for
the
woman
who
waited
on
him
and
kept
his
flat
and
who
evidently
thought
his
absence
was
likely
to
be
a
long
one
had
not
arrived
he
drove
to
the
grim
grey
building
on
the
thames
embankment
a
police
veteran
was
waiting
for
him
and
mcnorton
was
in
the
office
you
look
fagged
said
the
commissioner
take
that
chair
and
you
look
hungry
too
have
you
breakfasted
beale
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
get
him
something
mcnorton
ring
that
bell
do
protest
my
good
fellow
i
had
exactly
the
same
kind
of
nights
as
you
had
and
i
know
that
it
is
grub
that
counts
more
than
sleep
he
gave
an
order
to
an
attendant
and
not
until
twenty
minutes
later
when
beale
had
finished
a
surprisingly
good
meal
in
the
room
did
the
commissioner
allow
the
story
to
be
told
now
i
ready
he
said
i
begin
at
the
beginning
said
stanford
beale
i
was
a
member
of
the
united
states
secret
service
until
after
the
war
when
at
the
request
of
kitson
who
is
known
to
you
i
came
to
europe
to
devote
all
my
time
to
watching
miss
cresswell
and
doctor
van
heerden
all
that
you
know
one
day
when
searching
the
doctor
rooms
in
his
absence
my
object
being
to
discover
some
evidence
in
relation
to
the
millinborn
murder
i
found
this
he
took
a
newspaper
cutting
from
his
and
laid
it
on
the
table
it
is
from
a
spanish
newspaper
and
i
will
translate
it
for
you
to
the
discretion
and
eminent
genius
of
alphonso
romanos
the
chief
medical
officer
of
vigo
the
farmers
of
the
district
have
been
spared
a
catastrophe
much
lamentable
i
am
translating
literally
monday
last
señor
don
marin
fernardey
of
la
linea
discovered
one
of
his
fields
of
corn
had
died
in
the
night
and
was
already
in
a
condition
of
rot
in
alarm
he
notified
the
chief
of
medicines
at
vigo
and
alphonso
romanos
with
that
zeal
and
alacrity
which
has
marked
his
acts
was
quickly
on
the
spot
accompanied
by
a
foreign
scientist
happily
the
learned
and
gentle
doctor
is
a
bacteriologist
superb
an
examination
of
the
dead
corn
which
already
emitted
unpleasant
odours
revealed
the
presence
of
a
new
disease
the
verde
orin
green
rust
by
his
orders
the
field
was
burnt
fortunately
the
area
was
small
and
dissociated
from
the
other
fields
of
señor
fernardey
by
wide
with
the
exception
of
two
small
pieces
of
the
infected
corn
carried
away
by
romanos
and
the
foreign
the
pest
was
incinerated
the
foreign
said
beale
was
doctor
van
heerden
the
date
was
when
the
doctor
was
taking
his
summer
holiday
and
i
have
had
no
difficulty
in
tracing
him
i
sent
one
of
my
men
to
vigo
to
interview
doctor
romanos
who
remembers
the
circumstances
perfectly
he
himself
had
thought
it
wisest
to
destroy
the
germ
after
carefully
noting
their
characteristics
and
he
expressed
the
anxious
hope
that
his
whilom
friend
van
heerden
had
done
the
same
van
heerden
of
course
did
nothing
of
the
sort
he
has
been
assiduously
cultivating
the
germs
in
his
laboratory
so
far
as
i
can
ascertain
from
professor
heyler
an
old
german
who
was
in
van
heerden
service
and
who
seems
a
fairly
honest
man
the
doctor
nearly
lost
the
culture
and
it
was
only
by
sending
out
small
quantities
to
various
seedy
scientists
and
getting
them
to
experiment
in
the
cultivation
of
the
germ
under
various
conditions
that
he
found
the
medium
in
which
they
best
flourish
it
is
i
believe
fermented
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
to
what
purpose
do
you
suggest
van
heerden
will
put
his
cultivations
asked
the
commissioner
i
am
coming
to
that
in
the
course
of
my
inquiries
and
searchings
i
found
that
he
was
collecting
very
accurate
data
concerning
the
great
wheatfields
of
the
world
from
the
particulars
he
was
preparing
i
formed
the
idea
that
he
intended
and
intends
sending
an
army
of
agents
all
over
the
world
who
at
a
given
signal
will
release
the
germs
in
the
growing
wheat
but
surely
a
few
germs
sprinkled
on
a
great
wheatfield
such
as
you
find
in
america
would
do
no
more
than
local
damage
beale
shook
his
head
he
said
soberly
if
i
broke
a
tube
of
that
stuff
in
the
corner
of
a
field
the
whole
field
would
be
rotten
in
hours
it
spreads
from
stalk
to
stalk
with
a
rapidity
that
is
amazing
one
germ
multiplies
itself
in
a
living
cornfield
a
billion
times
in
twelve
hours
it
would
not
only
be
possible
but
certain
that
twenty
of
van
heerden
agents
in
america
could
destroy
the
harvests
of
the
united
states
in
a
week
but
why
should
he
do
this
he
is
a
german
you
say
and
germans
do
not
engage
in
frightfulness
unless
they
see
a
dividend
at
the
end
of
it
there
is
a
dividend
a
dividend
of
millions
at
the
end
of
it
said
beale
graver
that
much
i
know
i
can
not
tell
you
any
more
yet
but
i
can
say
this
that
up
till
yesterday
van
heerden
was
carrying
on
the
work
without
the
aid
of
his
government
that
is
no
longer
the
case
there
is
now
a
big
syndicate
in
existence
to
finance
him
and
the
principal
shareholder
is
the
german
government
he
has
already
spent
thousands
money
he
has
borrowed
and
money
he
has
stolen
as
a
and
sheerly
to
secure
her
money
he
carried
off
john
millinborn
heiress
with
the
object
of
forcing
her
into
a
marriage
the
commissioner
chewed
the
end
of
his
cigar
this
is
a
state
matter
and
one
on
which
i
must
consult
the
home
office
you
tell
me
that
the
foreign
office
believe
your
story
of
course
i
do
too
he
added
quickly
though
it
sounds
wildly
improbable
wait
here
he
took
up
his
hat
and
went
out
it
is
going
to
be
a
difficult
business
to
convict
van
heerden
said
the
superintendent
when
his
chief
had
gone
you
see
in
the
english
courts
motive
must
be
proved
to
convict
before
a
jury
and
there
seems
no
motive
except
revenge
a
jury
would
take
a
lot
of
convincing
that
a
man
spent
thousands
of
pounds
to
avenge
a
wrong
done
to
his
country
beale
had
no
answer
to
this
at
the
back
of
his
mind
he
had
a
dim
idea
of
the
sheer
money
value
of
the
scheme
but
he
needed
other
evidence
than
he
possessed
the
commissioner
returned
soon
after
i
have
been
on
the
to
the
and
we
will
take
action
against
van
heerden
on
the
evidence
the
factory
offers
i
put
you
in
charge
of
the
case
mcnorton
you
have
the
already
good
he
shook
hands
with
beale
you
will
make
a
european
name
over
this
beale
he
said
i
hope
europe
will
have
nothing
more
to
talk
about
said
beale
they
passed
back
to
mcnorton
office
i
come
right
along
said
the
superintendent
he
was
taking
his
hat
from
a
peg
when
he
saw
a
closed
envelope
lying
on
his
desk
from
the
local
police
station
he
said
how
long
has
this
been
here
his
clerk
shook
his
head
i
ca
tell
you
sir
it
has
been
there
since
i
came
in
h
i
must
have
overlooked
it
perhaps
it
is
news
from
your
factory
he
tore
it
open
scanned
the
contents
and
swore
there
goes
your
evidence
beale
he
said
what
is
it
asked
beale
quickly
the
factory
was
burned
to
the
ground
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
he
said
the
fire
started
in
the
old

and
the
whole
building

collapsed
the

out
of
the
window

the
evidence
of

chapter

a
scheme
to
starve
the
world
there
is
a
menace
about
monday
morning
which
few
have
escaped
it
is
a
menace
which
in
one
guise
or
another
clouds
hundreds
of
millions
of
pillows
gives
to
the
golden
sunlight
which
filters
through
a
billion
panes
the
very
hues
and
character
of
jaundice
it
is
the
menace
of
factory
and
workshop
harsh
prisons
which
shut
men
and
women
from
the
green
fields
and
the
pleasant
the
menace
of
new
responsibilities
to
be
faced
and
new
difficulties
to
be
overcome
into
the
space
of
monday
morning
drain
the
dregs
of
last
week
commitments
to
gather
into
stagnant
pools
upon
the
desks
and
benches
of
toiling
and
scheming
humanity
it
is
the
end
of
the
holiday
the
foot
of
the
new
hill
whose
crest
is
saturday
night
and
whose
most
pleasant
outlook
is
the
sunday
to
come
men
go
to
their
work
reluctant
and
resentful
and
reach
out
for
the
support
which
the
brings
one
in
london
is
about
six
in
chicago
therefore
the
significance
of
shoals
of
cablegrams
which
lay
on
the
desks
of
certain
brokers
was
not
wholly
apparent
until
late
in
the
evening
and
was
not
thoroughly
understood
until
late
on
tuesday
morning
when
to
other
and
greater
shoals
of
cables
came
the
terse
from
the
board
of
trade
in
chicago
and
on
top
of
all
the
wirelessed
press
accounts
for
the
sensational
jump
in
wheat
wheat
soaring
said
one
headline
frantic
scenes
in
the
pit
said
another
wheat
reaches
famine
price
blared
a
third
beale
passing
through
to
whitehall
heard
the
shrill
call
of
the
newsboys
and
caught
the
word
wheat
he
snatched
a
paper
from
the
hands
of
a
boy
and
read
every
in
the
northern
hemisphere
was
in
a
condition
of
chaos
prices
were
jumping
to
a
figure
beyond
any
which
the
most
stringent
days
of
the
war
had
produced
he
slipped
into
a
telephone
booth
gave
a
treasury
number
and
mcnorton
answered
have
you
seen
the
papers
he
asked
no
but
i
heard
you
mean
about
the
wheat
boom
yes
the
game
has
started
where
are
you
wait
for
me
i
join
you
three
minutes
later
mcnorton
appeared
from
the
whitehall
end
of
scotland
yard
beale
hailed
a
cab
and
they
drove
to
the
hotel
together
warrants
have
been
issued
for
van
heerden
and
milsom
and
the
girl
glaum
he
said
i
expect
we
shall
find
the
nest
empty
but
i
have
sent
men
to
all
the
railway
stations
do
you
think
we
moved
too
late
everything
depends
on
the
system
that
van
heerden
has
adopted
replied
beale
he
is
the
sort
of
man
who
would
keep
everything
in
his
own
hands
if
he
has
done
that
and
we
catch
him
we
may
prevent
a
world
catastrophe
at
the
hotel
they
found
kitson
waiting
in
the
vestibule
well
he
asked
i
gather
that
you
lost
van
heerden
but
if
the
newspapers
mean
anything
his
hand
is
down
on
the
table
everybody
is
crazy
here
he
said
as
he
led
the
way
to
the
elevator
i
just
been
speaking
to
the
for
agriculture
all
europe
is
scared
now
what
is
the
story
he
asked
when
they
were
in
his
room
he
listened
attentively
and
did
not
interrupt
until
stanford
beale
had
finished
that
big
enough
he
said
i
owe
you
an
apology
much
as
i
was
interested
in
miss
cresswell
i
realize
that
her
fate
was
as
nothing
beside
the
greater
issue
what
does
it
mean
asked
mcnorton
the
wheat
panic
god
knows
it
may
mean
bread
at
a
guinea
a
pound
it
is
too
early
to
judge
the
door
was
opened
unceremoniously
and
a
man
strode
in
mcnorton
was
the
first
to
recognize
the
intruder
and
rose
to
his
feet
i
sorry
to
interrupt
you
said
lord
sevington
it
was
the
foreign
secretary
of
great
britain
himself
well
beale
the
fantastic
story
you
told
me
seems
in
a
fair
way
to
being
realized
this
is
kitson
introduced
stanford
and
the
statesman
bowed
i
sent
for
you
but
decided
i
could
wait
so
i
came
myself
ah
mcnorton
what
are
the
chances
of
catching
van
heerden
no
man
has
ever
escaped
from
this
country
once
his
identity
was
established
said
the
police
chief
hopefully
if
we
had
taken
beale
advice
we
should
have
the
gentleman
under
lock
and
key
said
the
foreign
minister
shaking
his
head
you
probably
know
that
beale
has
been
in
communication
with
the
foreign
office
for
some
time
he
said
addressing
kitson
i
did
not
know
admitted
the
lawyer
we
thought
it
was
one
of
those
brilliant
stories
which
the
american
newspaper
reporter
loves
smiled
the
minister
i
do
quite
get
the
commercial
end
of
it
said
kitson
how
does
van
heerden
benefit
by
destroying
the
crops
of
the
world
he
does
benefit
because
the
crops
wo
be
destroyed
said
the
minister
the
south
russian
crops
are
all
right
the
german
crops
are
intact
but
are
practically
all
mortgaged
to
the
german
government
the
government
this
morning
the
german
government
have
made
two
announcements
the
first
is
the
commandeering
of
all
the
standing
crops
and
at
the
same
time
the
taking
over
of
all
options
on
the
sale
of
wheat
great
granaries
are
being
established
all
over
germany
the
old
zeppelin
sheds
great
heavens
cried
kitson
and
stared
at
stanford
beale
that
was
the
reason
they
took
over
the
sheds
a
pretty
good
reason
too
said
beale
storage
is
everything
in
a
crisis
like
this
what
is
the
second
announcement
sir
they
prohibit
the
export
of
grain
said
lord
sevington
the
whole
of
germany
is
to
be
rationed
for
a
year
bread
is
to
be
supplied
by
the
government
free
of
all
cost
to
the
people
in
this
way
germany
handles
the
surpluses
for
us
to
buy
what
will
she
charge
what
she
wishes
if
van
heerden
scheme
goes
through
if
throughout
the
world
the
crops
are
destroyed
and
only
that
which
lies
under
germany
hand
is
spared
what
must
we
pay
every
penny
we
have
taken
from
germany
every
cent
of
her
war
costs
must
be
returned
to
her
in
exchange
for
wheat
impossible
why
impossible
there
is
no
limit
to
the
price
of
rarities
what
is
rarer
than
gold
is
more
costly
than
gold
you
who
are
in
the
room
are
the
only
people
in
the
world
who
know
the
secret
of
the
green
rust
and
i
can
speak
frankly
to
you
i
tell
you
that
we
must
either
buy
from
germany
or
make
war
on
germany
and
the
latter
course
is
impossible
and
if
it
were
possible
would
give
us
no
certainty
of
relief
we
shall
have
to
pay
britain
france
america
italy
we
shall
have
to
pay
we
shall
pay
in
gold
we
may
have
to
pay
in
battleships
and
material
our
stocks
of
corn
have
been
allowed
to
fall
and
we
have
less
than
a
supply
in
england
every
producing
country
in
the
world
will
stop
exporting
instantly
and
they
too
with
the
harvest
nearly
due
will
be
near
the
end
of
their
stocks
now
tell
me
beale
in
your
judgment
is
it
possible
to
save
the
crops
by
local
action
beale
shook
his
head
i
doubt
it
he
said
it
would
mean
the
mobilisation
of
millions
of
men
the
surrounding
of
all
and
even
then
i
doubt
if
your
protection
would
be
efficacious
you
could
send
the
stuff
into
the
fields
by
a
hundred
methods
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
catch
van
heerden
and
stifle
the
scheme
at
its
the
chief
of
the
foreign
ministry
strode
up
and
down
the
room
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
his
head
upon
his
breast
it
means
our
holding
out
for
twelve
months
he
said
can
we
do
it
it
means
more
than
that
sir
said
beale
quietly
lord
sevington
stopped
and
faced
him
more
than
that
what
do
you
mean
it
may
mean
a
cornless
world
for
a
generation
said
beale
i
have
consulted
the
best
authorities
and
they
agree
that
the
soil
will
be
infected
for
ten
years
the
four
men
looked
at
one
another
helplessly
why
said
sevington
in
awe
the
whole
social
and
industrial
fabric
of
the
world
would
crumble
into
dust
america
would
be
ruined
for
a
hundred
years
there
would
be
deaths
by
the
million
it
means
the
very
end
of
civilization
beale
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
little
group
sevington
with
his
hard
old
face
set
in
harsh
lines
a
stony
sphinx
of
a
man
showing
no
other
sign
of
his
emotions
than
a
mop
of
ruffled
hair
kitson
an
old
man
and
almost
as
hard
of
feature
yet
of
the
two
more
human
stood
with
pursed
lip
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
as
if
he
were
studying
the
geometrical
pattern
of
the
parquet
for
future
reference
mcnorton
big
and
expressionless
save
that
his
mouth
dropped
and
that
his
arms
were
tightly
folded
as
if
he
were
hugging
himself
in
a
sheer
ecstasy
of
pain
from
the
street
outside
came
the
roar
and
rumble
of
london
traffic
the
dull
murmur
of
countless
voices
and
the
shrill
whine
of
a
newsboy
men
and
women
were
buying
newspapers
and
seeing
no
more
in
the
scare
headlines
than
a
newspaper
sensation
they
might
read
further
and
grow
a
little
uncomfortable
but
for
the
moment
they
were
only
mildly
interested
and
the
majority
would
turn
to
the
back
page
for
the
list
of
arrivals
at
lingfield
it
is
unbelievable
said
kitson
i
have
exactly
the
same
feeling
i
had
on
august
that
sensation
of
unreality
his
voice
seemed
to
arouse
the
foreign
minister
from
the
meditation
into
which
he
had
fallen
and
he
started
beale
he
said
you
have
unlimited
authority
to
act
mcnorton
you
will
go
back
to
scotland
yard
and
ask
the
chief
commissioner
to
attend
at
the
office
of
the
privy
seal
beale
will
keep
in
touch
with
me
all
the
time
without
any
formal
he
made
his
exit
followed
by
superintendent
mcnorton
that
a
badly
rattled
man
said
kitson
shrewdly
the
government
may
fall
on
this
news
what
will
you
do
get
van
heerden
said
the
other
it
is
the
job
of
your
life
said
kitson
quietly
and
beale
knew
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
that
the
lawyer
did
not
exaggerate
van
heerden
had
disappeared
with
dramatic
suddenness
detectives
who
visited
his
flat
discovered
that
his
personal
belongings
had
been
removed
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
he
had
left
with
two
trunks
which
were
afterwards
found
in
a
of
a
london
railway
terminus
and
a
companion
who
was
identified
as
milsom
whether
the
car
had
gone
east
or
north
south
or
west
nobody
knew
in
the
early
editions
of
the
evening
newspapers
side
by
side
with
the
account
of
the
panic
scenes
on
was
the
notice

every

every

were
watched
by

the
one
photograph
of
van
heerden
in
existence
thousands
of
copies
of
an
excellent
snapshot
taken
by
one
of
assistants
were
distributed
by

to
every

at
two
hilda
glaum
was
arrested
and
conveyed
to
bow
street
she
showed
neither
surprise
nor
resentment
and
offered
no
information
as
to
van
heerden
whereabouts
throughout
the
afternoon
there
were
the
usual
crops
of
false
arrest
and
detention
of
perfectly
innocent
people
and
at
five
it
was
announced
that
all
telegraphic
communication
with
the
continent
and
with
the
western
hemisphere
was
suspended
until
further
notice
beale
came
back
from
barking
whither
he
had
gone
to
interview
a
choleric
commercial
traveller
who
bore
some
facial
resemblance
to
van
heerden
and
had
been
arrested
in
consequence
and
discovered
that
something
like
a
council
of
war
was
being
held
in
kitson
private
room
mcnorton
and
two
of
his
assistants
were
present
there
was
an
from
the
foreign
office
a
great
scientist
whose
services
had
been
called
upon
and
a
man
whom
he
recognized
as
a
member
of
the
committee
of
the
corn
exchange
he
shook
his
head
in
answer
to
mcnorton
inquiring
glance
and
would
have
taken
his
seat
at
the
table
but
kitson
who
had
risen
on
his
entrance
beckoned
him
to
the
window
we
can
do
without
you
for
a
little
while
beale
he
said
lowering
his
voice
there
somebody
there
he
jerked
his
head
to
a
door
which
led
to
another
room
of
his
suite
who
requires
an
explanation
and
i
think
your
time
will
be
so
fully
occupied
in
the
next
few
days
that
you
had
better
seize
this
opportunity
whilst
you
have
it
miss
cresswell
said
beale
in
despair
the
old
man
nodded
slowly
what
does
she
know
that
is
for
you
to
discover
said
kitson
gently
and
pushed
him
toward
the
door
with
a
quaking
heart
he
turned
the
knob
and
stepped
guiltily
into
the
presence
of
the
girl
who
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
was
his
wife
chapter
xxviii
the
coming
of
milsom
she
rose
to
meet
him
and
he
stood
spellbound
still
holding
the
handle
of
the
door
it
seemed
that
she
had
taken
on
new
qualities
a
new
and
an
ethereal
grace
at
the
very
thought
even
of
his
technical
possession
of
this
smiling
girl
who
came
forward
to
greet
him
his
heart
thumped
so
loudly
that
he
felt
she
must
hear
it
she
was
pale
and
there
were
dark
shadows
under
her
eyes
but
the
hand
that
gripped
his
was
firm
and
warm
and
living
i
have
to
thank
you
for
much
beale
she
said
kitson
has
told
me
that
i
owe
my
rescue
to
you
did
he
he
asked
awkwardly
and
wondered
what
else
kitson
had
told
her
i
am
trying
to
be
very
sensible
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
because
you
are
the
most
sensible
man
i
know
she
went
back
to
the
where
she
had
been
sitting
and
pointed
to
another
it
was
horribly
melodramatic
was
it
but
i
suppose
the
life
of
a
detective
is
full
of
melodrama
oh
brimming
over
he
said
if
you
keep
very
quiet
i
will
give
you
a
résumé
of
my
most
interesting
cases
he
said
making
a
pathetic
attempt
to
be
flippant
and
the
girl
detected
something
of
his
insincerity
you
have
had
a
trying
day
she
said
with
quick
sympathy
have
you
arrested
doctor
van
heerden
he
shook
his
head
i
am
glad
she
said
glad
she
nodded
before
he
is
arrested
she
spoke
with
some
hesitation
i
want
one
little
matter
cleared
up
i
asked
kitson
but
he
put
me
off
and
said
you
would
tell
me
everything
what
is
it
he
asked
steadily
she
got
up
and
went
to
her
bag
which
stood
upon
a
opened
it
and
took
out
something
which
she
laid
on
the
palm
of
her
hand
she
came
back
with
hand
extended
and
beale
looked
at
the
glittering
object
on
her
palm
and
was
speechless
do
you
see
that
she
asked
he
nodded
having
no
words
for
the
moment
for
that
was
a
thin
gold
ring
it
is
a
wedding
ring
she
said
and
i
found
it
on
my
finger
when
i
recovered
oh
said
beale
blankly
was
i
married
she
asked
he
made
two
or
three
ineffectual
attempts
to
speak
and
ended
by
nodding
i
feared
so
she
said
quietly
you
see
i
recollect
nothing
of
what
happened
the
last
thing
i
remembered
was
doctor
van
heerden
sitting
beside
me
and
putting
something
into
my
arm
it
hurt
a
little
but
not
very
much
and
i
remember
i
spoke
to
him
i
think
it
was
about
you
a
little
colour
came
to
her
face
or
perhaps
he
was
speaking
about
you
i
am
not
sure
she
said
hurriedly
i
know
that
you
came
into
it
somehow
and
that
is
all
i
can
recall
nothing
else
he
asked
dismally
nothing
she
said
try
try
try
to
remember
he
urged
her
he
realized
he
was
being
a
pitiable
coward
and
that
he
wanted
to
shift
the
responsibility
for
the
revelation
upon
her
she
smiled
and
shook
her
head
i
am
sorry
but
i
ca
remember
anything
now
you
are
going
to
tell
me
he
discovered
that
he
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
chair
and
that
he
was
more
nervous
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
so
i
am
going
to
tell
you
he
said
in
a
hollow
voice
of
course
tell
you
it
is
rather
difficult
you
understand
she
looked
at
him
kindly
i
know
it
must
be
difficult
for
a
man
like
you
to
speak
of
your
own
achievements
but
for
once
you
are
going
to
be
immodest
she
laughed
well
you
see
he
began
i
knew
van
heerden
wanted
to
marry
you
i
knew
that
all
along
i
guessed
he
wanted
to
marry
you
for
your
money
because
in
the
circumstances
there
was
nothing
else
he
could
want
to
marry
you
for
he
added
i
mean
he
corrected
himself
hastily
that
money
was
the
most
attractive
thing
to
him
this
does
sound
very
flattering
she
smiled
i
know
i
am
being
crude
but
you
will
forgive
me
when
you
learn
what
i
have
to
say
he
said
huskily
van
heerden
wanted
to
marry
you
and
he
married
me
she
said
and
i
am
going
to
break
that
marriage
as
soon
as
i
possibly
can
i
know
i
hope
so
said
stanford
beale
i
believe
it
is
difficult
but
i
will
do
all
i
possibly
can
believe
me
miss
cresswell
i
am
not
miss
cresswell
any
longer
she
said
with
a
wry
little
face
but
please
do
call
me
by
my
real
name
i
wo
he
said
fervently
you
knew
he
wanted
to
marry
me
for
my
money
and
not
for
my
beauty
or
my
accomplishments
she
said
and
so
you
followed
me
down
to
deans
folly
yes
yes
but
i
must
explain
i
know
it
will
sound
horrible
to
you
and
you
may
have
the
lowest
opinion
of
me
but
i
have
got
to
tell
you
he
saw
the
look
of
alarm
gather
in
her
eyes
and
plunged
into
his
story
i
thought
that
if
you
were
already
married
van
heerden
would
be
satisfied
and
take
no
further
steps
against
you
but
i
was
already
married
she
said
puzzled
wait
wait
please
he
begged
keep
that
in
your
mind
that
i
was
satisfied
van
heerden
wanted
you
for
your
money
and
that
if
you
were
already
married
or
even
if
you
were
and
he
thought
you
were
i
could
save
you
from
dangers
the
extent
of
which
even
i
do
not
know
and
there
was
a
man
named
homo
a
crook
he
had
been
a
parson
and
had
all
the
manner
and
style
of
his
profession
so
i
got
a
special
licence
in
my
own
name
you
she
said
breathlessly
a
marriage
licence
to
marry
me
he
nodded
and
i
took
homo
with
me
in
my
search
for
you
i
knew
that
i
should
have
a
very
small
margin
of
time
and
i
thought
if
homo
performed
the
ceremony
and
i
could
confront
van
heerden
with
the
accomplished
deed
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
laugh
oh
i
see
i
see
she
said
oh
how
splendid
and
you
went
through
this
mock
ceremony
where
was
i
you
were
at
the
window
he
said
miserably
but
how
lovely
and
you
were
outside
and
your
parson
with
the
funny
name
but
that
delicious
so
i
was
married
at
all
and
this
is
your
ring
she
picked
it
up
with
a
mocking
light
in
her
eyes
and
held
it
out
to
him
but
he
shook
his
head
you
were
married
he
said
in
a
voice
which
was
hardly
audible
married
how
homo
was
not
a
fake
he
was
a
real
clergyman
and
the
marriage
was
legal
they
looked
at
one
another
without
speaking
on
the
girl
part
there
was
nothing
but
pure
amazement
but
stanford
beale
read
horror
loathing
consternation
and
unforgiving
wrath
and
waited
as
the
criminal
waits
for
his
sentence
upon
her
next
words
so
i
am
really
married
to
you
she
said
wonderingly
you
will
never
forgive
me
i
know
he
did
not
look
at
her
now
my
own
excuse
is
that
i
did
what
i
did
because
i
wanted
to
save
you
i
might
have
sailed
in
with
a
gun
and
shot
them
up
i
might
have
waited
my
chance
and
broken
into
the
house
i
might
have
taken
a
risk
and
surrounded
the
place
with
police
but
that
would
have
meant
delay
i
did
do
the
normal
things
or
take
the
normal
view
i
could
with
you
he
did
not
see
the
momentary
tenderness
in
her
eyes
because
he
was
not
looking
at
her
and
went
on
that
the
whole
of
the
grisly
story
kitson
will
advise
you
as
to
what
steps
you
may
take
to
free
yourself
it
was
a
most
horrible
blunder
and
it
was
all
the
more
tragic
because
you
were
the
victim
you
of
all
the
persons
in
the
world
she
had
put
the
ring
down
and
now
she
took
it
up
again
and
examined
it
curiously
it
is
rather
quaint
is
it
she
asked
oh
very
he
thought
he
heard
a
sob
and
looked
up
she
was
laughing
at
first
silently
then
as
the
humour
of
the
thing
seized
her
her
laugh
rang
clear
and
he
caught
its
infection
it
funny
she
said
at
last
wiping
her
eyes
there
is
a
humorous
side
to
it
poor
mr
beale
i
deserve
a
little
pity
he
said
ruefully
why
she
asked
quickly
have
you
committed
bigamy
not
noticeably
so
he
answered
with
a
smile
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
it
rather
serious
when
one
thinks
of
it
seriously
so
i
am
stanford
beale
poor
beale
and
poor
i
do
hope
she
said
and
this
time
her
seriousness
was
genuine
that
i
have
not
upset
any
of
your
plans
too
much
oh
she
sat
down
suddenly
staring
at
him
it
would
be
awful
she
said
in
a
hushed
voice
and
i
would
never
forgive
myself
is
there
forgive
my
asking
the
question
but
i
suppose
with
a
flashing
smile
as
your
wife
i
am
entitled
to
your
confidence
is
there
somebody
you
are
going
to
marry
i
have
neither
committed
bigamy
nor
do
i
contemplate
it
said
beale
who
was
gradually
recovering
his
grip
of
the
situation
if
you
mean
am
i
engaged
to
somebody
in
fact
to
a
girl
he
said
recklessly
the
answer
is
in
the
negative
there
will
be
no
broken
hearts
on
my
side
of
the
family
i
have
no
desire
to
probe
your
wounded
heart
do
be
flippant
she
stopped
him
sternly
it
is
a
very
terrible
situation
beale
and
i
hardly
dare
to
think
of
it
i
realize
how
terrible
it
is
he
said
suddenly
bold
and
as
i
tell
you
i
will
do
everything
i
can
to
correct
my
blunder
does
kitson
know
she
asked
he
nodded
what
did
kitson
say
surely
he
gave
you
some
advice
he
said
began
stanford
and
went
red
the
girl
did
not
pursue
the
subject
come
let
us
talk
about
the
matter
like
rational
beings
she
said
cheerfully
i
have
got
over
my
first
inclination
to
swoon
you
must
curb
your
very
natural
desire
to
be
haughty
i
can
not
tell
you
what
we
can
do
yet
i
do
want
to
discuss
the
unpleasant
details
of
a
divorce
he
said
and
perhaps
you
will
let
me
have
a
few
days
before
we
decide
on
any
line
of
action
van
heerden
is
still
at
large
and
until
he
is
under
lock
and
key
and
this
immense
danger
which
threatens
the
world
is
removed
i
can
hardly
think
straight
kitson
has
told
me
about
van
heerden
she
said
quietly
is
it
rather
a
matter
for
the
english
police
to
deal
with
as
i
have
reason
to
know
she
shivered
slightly
doctor
van
heerden
is
a
man
without
any
fear
or
scruple
my
scruples
hardly
keep
me
awake
at
night
he
said
and
i
guess
not
going
to
let
up
on
van
heerden
i
look
upon
it
as
my
particular
job
is
it
she
hesitated
is
it
rather
dangerous
for
me
he
laughed
no
i
do
think
so
and
even
if
it
were
in
the
most
tragic
sense
of
the
word
dangerous
why
that
would
save
you
a
great
deal
of
unpleasantness
i
think
you
are
being
horrid
she
said
i
am
sorry
he
responded
quickly
i
was
fishing
for
a
little
pity
and
it
was
rather
cheap
and
theatrical
no
i
do
not
think
there
is
very
much
danger
van
heerden
is
going
to
keep
under
cover
and
he
is
after
something
bigger
than
my
young
life
is
milsom
with
him
he
is
the
weak
link
in
van
heerden
scheme
beale
said
somehow
van
heerden
does
strike
me
as
a
good
team
leader
and
what
little
i
have
seen
of
milsom
leads
me
to
the
belief
that
he
is
hardly
the
man
to
follow
the
doctor
lead
blindly
besides
it
is
always
easier
to
catch
two
men
than
one
he
laughed
that
is
an
old
detective
axiom
and
it
works
out
she
put
out
her
hand
it
a
tangled
business
is
it
she
said
i
mean
us
do
let
it
add
to
your
other
worries
forget
our
unfortunate
relationship
until
we
can
smooth
things
out
he
shook
her
hand
in
silence
and
now
i
am
coming
out
to
hear
all
that
you
clever
people
suggest
she
said
please
do
look
alarmed
i
have
been
talking
all
the
afternoon
and
have
been
narrating
my
sad
experience
such
as
i
remember
to
the
most
important
people
cabinet
ministers
and
police
commissioners
and
doctors
and
things
one
moment
he
said
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
stout
book
i
was
wondering
what
that
was
she
laughed
you
have
been
buying
me
he
nodded
and
held
the
volume
so
that
she
could
read
the
title
friend
in
need
by
beale
i
did
know
you
wrote
she
said
in
surprise
i
am
literary
and
even
worse
he
said
flippantly
i
see
you
have
a
shelf
of
books
here
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
put
it
with
the
others
but
may
i
see
it
he
shook
his
head
i
just
want
to
tell
you
all
you
have
said
about
van
heerden
is
true
he
is
a
most
dangerous
man
he
may
yet
be
dangerous
to
you
i
do
want
you
to
touch
that
little
book
unless
you
are
in
really
serious
trouble
will
you
promise
me
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
but
mr
beale
will
you
promise
me
he
said
again
of
course
i
promise
you
but
i
do
quite
understand
you
will
understand
he
said
he
opened
the
door
for
her
and
she
passed
out
ahead
of
him
kitson
came
to
meet
them
i
suppose
there
is
no
news
asked
stanford
none
said
the
other
except
high
political
news
there
has
been
an
exchange
of
notes
between
the
triple
alliance
and
the
german
government
all
communication
with
the
ukraine
is
cut
off
and
three
ships
have
been
sunk
in
the
bosphorus
so
cleverly
that
our
grain
ships
in
the
black
sea
are
isolated
that
bad
said
beale
he
walked
to
the
table
it
was
littered
with
maps
and
charts
and
printed
tabulations
mcnorton
got
up
and
joined
them
i
have
just
had
a
message
through
from
the
yard
he
said
carter
my
assistant
says
that
he
certain
van
heerden
has
not
left
london
has
the
girl
spoken
glaum
no
she
as
dumb
as
an
oyster
i
doubt
if
you
would
get
her
to
speak
even
if
you
put
her
through
the
third
degree
and
we
do
allow
that
so
i
am
told
said
beale
dryly
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
unlock
it
somebody
said
kitson
i
turned
the
key
the
nearest
person
was
the
member
of
the
corn
exchange
committee
and
he
clicked
back
the
lock
and
the
door
opened
to
admit
a
waiter
there
a
man
here
he
said
but
before
he
could
say
more
he
was
pushed
aside
and
a
dusty
dishevelled
figure
stepped
into
the
room
and
glanced
round
my
name
is
milsom
he
said
i
have
come
to
give
king
evidence
chapter
xxix
the
lost
code
i
milsom
said
the
man
in
the
doorway
again
his
clothes
were
grimed
and
dusty
his
collar
limp
and
soiled
there
were
two
days
growth
of
stubble
on
his
big
jaw
and
he
bore
himself
like
a
man
who
was
faint
from
lack
of
sleep
he
walked
unsteadily
to
the
table
and
fell
into
a
chair
where
is
van
heerden
asked
beale
but
milsom
shook
his
head
i
left
him
two
hours
ago
after
a
long
and
unprofitable
talk
on
patriotism
he
said
and
laughed
shortly
at
that
time
he
was
making
his
way
back
to
his
house
in
southwark
then
he
is
in
london
here
in
london
milsom
nodded
you
wo
find
him
he
said
brusquely
i
tell
you
i
left
him
after
a
talk
about
certain
patriotic
misgivings
on
my
part
look
he
lifted
his
right
hand
which
hitherto
he
had
kept
concealed
by
his
side
and
oliva
shut
her
eyes
and
felt
deathly
sick
right
index
digit
and
part
of
the
phalanges
shot
away
said
milsom
philosophically
that
was
my
but
he
shot
first
give
me
a
drink
they
brought
him
a
bottle
of
wine
and
he
drank
it
from
a
long
tumbler
in
two
great
breathless
gulps
you
closed
the
coast
to
him
he
said
you
shut
down
your
wires
and
cables
you
watching
the
roads
but
he
get
his
message
through
if
then
he
has
cabled
said
beale
eagerly
milsom
this
means
liberty
for
you
liberty
and
comfort
tell
us
the
truth
man
help
us
hold
off
this
horror
that
van
heerden
is
loosing
on
the
world
and
there
no
reward
too
great
for
you
milsom
eyes
narrowed
it
was
the
hope
of
reward
or
hope
of
pardon
that
made
me
break
with
van
heerden
he
said
in
his
slow
way
you
laugh
yourself
sick
if
i
told
you
it
was
it
was
the
knowledge
that
this
country
would
be
down
and
out
that
the
people
who
spoke
my
tongue
and
thought
more
or
less
as
i
thought
should
be
under
the
foot
of
the
beast
fevered
sentimentality
you
do
believe
that
i
believe
it
it
was
oliva
who
spoke
and
it
appeared
that
this
was
the
first
time
that
milsom
had
noticed
her
presence
for
his
eyes
opened
wider
you
oh
you
believe
it
do
you
and
he
nodded
but
why
is
van
heerden
waiting
asked
mcnorton
what
is
he
waiting
for
the
big
man
rolled
his
head
helplessly
from
side
to
side
and
the
hard
cackle
of
his
laughter
was
very
trying
to
men
whose
nerves
were
raw
and
on
edge
that
the
fatal
lunacy
of
it
i
think
it
must
be
a
national
characteristic
you
saw
it
in
the
war
again
and
again
a
wonderful
plan
brought
to
naught
by
some
piece
of
on
the
part
of
the
a
wild
hope
leapt
to
beale
heart
then
it
has
failed
the
rust
has
not
answered
but
milsom
shook
his
head
wearily
the
rust
is
all
that
he
thinks
and
then
some
he
said
no
it
that
it
is
in
the
work
of
organization
where
the
hitch
has
occurred
you
know
something
of
the
story
van
heerden
has
agents
in
every
country
in
the
world
he
has
spent
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
perfecting
his
working
plans
and
i
willing
to
admit
that
they
are
wellnigh
perfect
such
slight
mistakes
as
sending
men
to
south
africa
and
australia
where
the
crops
are
six
months
later
than
the
european
and
american
harvests
may
be
forgiven
because
the
german
thinks
longitudinally
and
north
and
south
are
the
two
points
of
the
compass
which
he
never
bothers
his
head
about
if
the
germans
had
been
a
seafaring
people
they
have
discovered
america
before
columbus
but
they
would
never
have
found
the
north
pole
or
rounded
the
cape
in
a
million
years
he
paused
and
they
saw
the
flicker
of
a
smile
in
his
weary
eyes
the
whole
scheme
is
under
van
heerden
hand
at
the
word
thousands
of
his
agents
begin
their
work
of
destruction
but
the
word
must
come
from
him
he
has
so
centralized
his
scheme
that
if
he
died
suddenly
without
that
word
being
uttered
the
work
of
years
would
come
to
naught
i
guess
he
is
suspicious
of
everybody
including
his
new
government
for
the
best
part
of
a
year
he
has
been
arranging
and
planning
with
the
assistance
of
a
girl
a
compatriot
of
his
he
has
reduced
all
things
to
order
in
every
country
is
a
principal
agent
who
possesses
a
copy
of
a
simple
code
at
the
proper
moment
van
heerden
would
cable
a
word
which
meant
busy
or
off
until
you
hear
from
me
or
scheme
for
this
year
and
collect
cultures
i
happen
to
be
in
the
meanings
of
the
code
words
because
van
heerden
has
so
often
drummed
them
into
me
what
are
the
code
words
i
coming
to
that
nodded
milsom
van
heerden
is
the
type
of
scientist
that
never
trusts
his
memory
you
find
that
kind
in
all
the
school
they
usually
spend
their
time
making
the
most
complete
and
detailed
notes
and
their
studies
are
packed
with
memoranda
yet
he
had
a
wonderful
memory
for
the
commonplace
things
for
example
in
the
plain
english
of
his
three
messages
he
was
word
perfect
he
could
tell
you
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
his
agents
but
when
it
came
to
scientific
data
his
mind
was
a
blank
until
he
consulted
his
authorities
it
seemed
that
once
he
made
a
note
his
mind
was
incapable
of
retaining
the
information
he
had
committed
to
paper
that
as
i
say
is
a
phenomenon
which
is
not
infrequently
met
with
amongst
men
of
science
and
he
had
committed
the
code
to
paper
asked
kitson
i
am
coming
to
that
after
the
fire
at
the
paddington
works
van
heerden
said
the
time
had
come
to
make
a
get
away
he
was
going
to
the
continent
i
was
to
sail
for
canada
you
go
he
said
will
give
you
the
code
but
i
am
afraid
that
i
can
not
do
that
until
after
ten
mcnorton
was
scribbling
notes
in
shorthand
and
carefully
circled
the
hour
we
went
back
to
his
flat
and
had
breakfast
together
it
was
then
about
five
he
packed
a
few
things
and
i
particularly
noticed
that
he
looked
very
carefully
at
the
interior
of
a
little
grip
which
he
had
brought
the
previous
night
from
staines
he
was
so
furtive
carrying
the
bag
to
the
light
of
the
window
that
i
supposed
he
was
consulting
his
code
and
i
wondered
why
he
should
defer
giving
me
the
information
until
ten
anyway
i
could
swear
he
took
something
from
the
bag
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
we
left
the
flat
soon
after
and
drove
to
a
railway
station
where
the
baggage
was
left
van
heerden
had
given
me
for
a
thousand
pounds
in
case
we
should
be
separated
and
i
went
on
to
the
house
in
south
london
you
need
ask
me
where
it
is
because
van
heerden
is
not
there
he
gulped
again
at
the
wine
at
eleven
van
heerden
came
back
resumed
milsom
and
if
ever
a
man
was
it
was
he
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
that
the
code
was
mislaid
mislaid
beale
was
staggered
here
was
farce
interpolated
into
tragedy
the
most
grotesque
the
most
unbelievable
farce
mislaid
said
milsom
he
did
not
say
as
much
but
i
gathered
from
the
few
disjointed
words
he
flung
at
me
that
the
code
was
not
irredeemably
lost
in
fact
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
he
knows
where
it
is
it
was
after
that
that
van
heerden
started
in
to
do
some
tall
cursing
of
me
my
country
my
decadent
race
and
the
like
things
have
been
strained
all
the
afternoon
they
reached
a
climax
he
wanted
me
to
help
him
in
a
burglary
and
burglary
is
not
my
forte
what
did
he
want
to
burgle
asked
mcnorton
with
professional
interest
ah
there
you
have
me
it
was
the
question
i
asked
and
he
refused
to
answer
i
was
to
put
myself
in
his
hands
and
there
was
to
be
some
shooting
if
as
he
thought
likely
a
caretaker
was
left
on
the
premises
to
be
entered
i
told
him
flat
we
were
sitting
on
wandsworth
common
at
the
time
that
he
could
leave
me
out
and
that
is
where
we
became
mutually
offensive
he
looked
at
his
maimed
hand
i
dressed
it
roughly
at
a
chemist
the
iodine
open
dressing
beautiful
but
it
is
antiseptic
he
shot
to
kill
too
there
no
doubt
about
that
a
very
perfect
little
gentleman
he
in
london
said
mcnorton
that
simplifies
matters
to
my
mind
it
complicates
rather
than
simplifies
said
beale
london
is
a
vast
proposition
can
you
give
us
any
idea
as
to
the
hour
the
burglary
was
planned
for
eleven
said
milsom
promptly
that
is
to
say
in
a
little
over
an
hour
time
and
you
have
no
idea
of
the
locality
somewhere
in
the
east
of
london
we
were
to
have
met
at
aldgate
i
do
understand
it
said
mcnorton
do
you
suggest
that
the
code
is
in
the
hands
of
somebody
who
is
not
willing
to
part
with
it
and
now
that
he
no
longer
needs
it
for
you
is
there
any
reason
why
he
should
wait
every
reason
replied
milsom
and
stanford
beale
nodded
in
agreement
it
was
not
only
for
me
he
wanted
it
he
as
good
as
told
me
that
unless
he
recovered
it
he
would
be
unable
to
communicate
with
his
men
what
do
you
think
he
do
he
get
bridgers
to
assist
him
bridgers
is
a
pretty
sore
man
and
the
doctor
knows
just
where
he
can
find
him
as
oliva
listened
an
idea
slowly
dawned
in
her
mind
that
she
might
supply
a
solution
to
the
mystery
of
the
missing
code
it
was
a
wildly
improbable
theory
she
held
but
even
so
slender
a
possibility
was
not
to
be
discarded
she
slipped
from
the
group
and
went
back
to
her
room
for
the
accommodation
of
his
ward
james
kitson
had
taken
the
adjoining
suite
to
his
own
and
had
secured
a
lady
maid
from
an
agency
for
the
girl
service
she
passed
through
the
to
her
own
bedroom
and
found
the
maid
putting
the
room
ready
for
the
night
minnie
she
said
throwing
a
quick
glance
about
the
apartment
where
did
you
put
the
clothes
i
took
off
when
i
came
here
miss
the
girl
opened
the
wardrobe
and
oliva
made
a
hurried
search
did
you
find
anything
a
little
ticket
the
girl
smiled
oh
yes
miss
it
was
in
your
stocking
oliva
laughed
i
suppose
you
thought
it
was
rather
queer
finding
that
sort
of
thing
in
a
girl
stocking
she
asked
but
the
maid
was
busily
opening
the
drawers
of
the
in
search
of
something
here
it
is
miss
she
held
a
small
square
ticket
in
her
hand
and
held
it
with
such
disapproving
primness
that
oliva
nearly
laughed
i
found
it
in
your
stocking
miss
she
said
again
quite
right
said
oliva
coolly
that
where
i
put
it
i
always
carry
my
pawn
tickets
in
my
stocking
the
admirable
minnie
sniffed
i
suppose
you
have
never
seen
such
a
thing
smiled
oliva
and
you
hardly
knew
what
it
was
the
lady
maid
turned
very
red
she
had
unfortunately
seen
many
such
certificates
of
penury
but
all
that
was
part
of
her
private
life
and
she
had
been
shocked
beyond
measure
to
be
confronted
with
this
evidence
of
impecuniosity
in
the
home
of
a
lady
who
represented
to
her
an
assured
income
and
comfortable
pickings
oliva
went
back
to
her
and
debated
the
matter
it
was
a
sense
of
diffidence
the
fear
of
making
herself
ridiculous
which
arrested
her
otherwise
she
might
have
flown
into
the
room
declaimed
her
preposterous
theories
and
leave
these
clever
men
to
work
out
the
details
she
opened
the
door
and
with
the
ticket
clenched
in
her
hand
stepped
into
the
room
if
they
had
missed
her
after
she
had
left
nobody
saw
her
return
they
were
sitting
in
a
group
about
the
table
firing
questions
at
the
big
unshaven
man
who
had
made
such
a
dramatic
entrance
to
the
conference
and
who
with
a
long
cigar
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
was
answering
readily
and
fluently
but
faced
with
the
tangible
workings
of
criminal
investigation
her
resolution
and
her
theories
shrank
to
she
clasped
the
ticket
in
her
hand
and
felt
for
a
pocket
but
the
dressmaker
had
not
provided
her
with
that
useful
appendage
so
she
turned
and
went
softly
back
to
her
room
praying
that
she
would
not
be
noticed
she
closed
the
door
gently
behind
her
and
turned
to
meet
a
man
in
who
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
light
overcoat
thrown
over
his
arm
his
silk
hat
tilted
back
from
his
forehead
a
picture
of
calm
assurance
do
move
said
van
heerden
and
do
scream
and
be
good
enough
to
hand
over
the
pawn
ticket
you
are
holding
in
your
hand
silently
she
obeyed
and
as
she
handed
the
little
pasteboard
across
the
table
which
separated
them
she
looked
past
him
to
the
bookshelf
behind
his
head
and
particularly
to
a
new
volume
which
bore
the
name
of
stanford
beale
chapter
xxx
the
watch
thanks
said
van
heerden
pocketing
the
ticket
it
is
of
no
use
to
me
now
for
i
can
not
wait
i
gather
that
you
have
not
disclosed
the
fact
that
this
ticket
is
in
your
possession
i
do
know
how
you
gather
that
she
said
lower
your
voice
he
hissed
menacingly
i
gather
as
much
because
beale
knew
the
ticket
would
not
be
in
my
possession
now
if
he
only
knew
if
he
only
had
a
hint
of
its
existence
i
fear
my
scheme
would
fail
as
it
is
it
will
succeed
and
now
he
said
with
a
smile
time
is
short
and
your
preparations
must
be
of
the
briefest
i
will
save
you
the
trouble
of
asking
questions
by
telling
you
that
i
am
going
to
take
you
along
with
me
i
certainly
can
not
afford
to
leave
you
get
your
coat
with
a
shrug
she
walked
past
him
to
the
bedroom
and
he
followed
are
we
going
far
she
asked
there
was
no
tremor
in
her
voice
and
she
felt
remarkably
that
you
will
discover
said
he
i
am
not
asking
out
of
idle
curiosity
but
i
want
to
know
whether
i
ought
to
take
a
bag
perhaps
it
would
be
better
he
said
she
carried
the
little
attaché
case
back
to
the
you
have
no
objection
to
my
taking
a
little
light
she
asked
contemptuously
i
am
afraid
you
are
not
a
very
entertaining
companion
van
heerden
excellent
girl
said
van
heerden
cheerfully
take
anything
you
like
she
slipped
a
book
from
the
shelf
and
nearly
betrayed
herself
by
an
involuntary
exclamation
as
she
felt
its
weight
you
are
not
very
original
in
your
methods
she
said
this
is
the
second
time
you
have
spirited
me
off
the
gaols
of
england
as
your
friend
milsom
will
tell
you
are
filled
with
criminals
who
departed
from
the
beaten
tracks
said
van
heerden
walk
out
into
the
corridor
and
turn
to
the
right
i
will
be
close
behind
you
a
little
way
along
you
will
discover
a
narrow
passage
which
leads
to
the
service
staircase
go
down
that
i
am
sure
you
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
will
kill
you
if
you
attempt
to
make
any
signal
or
scream
or
appeal
for
help
she
did
not
answer
it
was
because
of
this
knowledge
and
this
fear
which
was
part
of
her
youthful
equipment
for
violent
death
is
a
very
terrible
prospect
to
the
young
and
the
healthy
that
she
obeyed
him
at
all
they
walked
down
the
stone
stairs
through
an
untidy
lobby
redolent
of
cooking
food
into
the
street
without
challenge
and
without
attracting
undue
notice
van
heerden
car
was
waiting
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
she
thought
she
recognized
the
chauffeur
as
bridgers
once
more
we
ride
together
said
van
heerden
gaily
and
what
will
be
the
end
of
this
adventure
for
you
depends
entirely
upon
your
loyalty
what
are
you
opening
your
bag
for
he
asked
peering
in
the
dark
i
am
looking
for
a
handkerchief
said
oliva
i
am
afraid
i
am
going
to
cry
he
settled
himself
back
in
the
corner
of
the
car
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
accepting
her
explanation
sarcasm
was
wholly
wasted
on
van
heerden
well
gentlemen
said
milsom
i
do
think
there
anything
more
i
can
tell
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
i
take
the
responsibility
of
not
executing
the
warrant
said
mcnorton
you
will
accompany
one
of
my
men
to
his
home
and
you
will
be
under
police
supervision
that
no
new
experience
said
milsom
there
only
one
piece
of
advice
i
want
to
give
you
and
that
is
asked
beale
do
underrate
van
heerden
you
have
no
conception
of
his
nerve
there
is
a
man
of
us
here
he
said
whose
insurance
rate
would
go
up
to
ninety
per
cent
if
van
heerden
decided
to
get
him
i
do
profess
that
i
can
help
you
to
explain
his
strange
conduct
i
can
only
outline
the
psychology
of
it
but
how
and
where
he
has
hidden
his
code
and
what
circumstances
prevent
its
recovery
is
known
only
to
van
heerden
he
nodded
to
the
little
group
and
accompanied
by
mcnorton
left
the
room
there
goes
a
pretty
bad
man
said
kitson
or
i
am
no
judge
of
character
he
an
old
lag
is
he
beale
nodded
murder
he
said
laconically
he
lived
after
his
time
he
should
have
been
a
contemporary
of
the
borgias
a
poisoner
shuddered
one
of
the
i
remember
the
case
he
killed
his
nephew
and
defended
himself
on
the
plea
that
the
youth
was
a
degenerate
as
he
undoubtedly
was
he
might
have
got
that
defence
past
in
america
or
france
said
beale
but
unfortunately
there
was
a
business
end
to
the
matter
he
was
the
sole
heir
of
his
nephew
considerable
fortune
and
a
jury
from
the
society
of
eugenics
would
have
convicted
him
on
that
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
turned
his
eyes
to
kitson
i
presume
miss
cresswell
is
bored
and
has
retired
for
the
night
he
said
i
find
out
in
a
moment
said
kitson
did
you
speak
to
her
beale
nodded
and
his
eyes
twinkled
did
you
make
any
progress
i
broke
the
sad
news
to
her
if
that
what
you
mean
you
told
her
she
was
married
to
you
good
heavens
what
did
she
say
well
she
did
faint
i
do
think
she
the
fainting
kind
she
is
cursed
with
a
sense
of
humour
and
refused
even
to
take
a
tragic
view
that
bad
said
kitson
shaking
his
head
a
sense
of
humour
is
out
of
place
in
a
divorce
court
and
that
is
where
your
little
romance
is
going
to
end
my
friend
i
am
not
so
sure
said
beale
calmly
and
the
other
stared
at
him
you
have
promised
me
he
began
with
a
note
of
acerbity
in
his
voice
and
you
have
advised
me
said
beale
kitson
choked
down
something
which
he
was
going
to
say
but
which
he
evidently
thought
was
better
left
unsaid
wait
he
commanded
i
will
find
out
whether
miss
cresswell
he
emphasized
the
words
has
gone
to
bed
he
passed
through
the
door
to
oliva
and
was
gone
a
few
minutes
when
he
came
back
beale
saw
his
troubled
face
and
ran
forward
to
meet
him
she
not
there
said
kitson
not
in
her
room
neither
in
the
nor
the
bedroom
i
have
rung
for
her
maid
oh
here
you
are
prim
minnie
came
through
the
bedroom
door
where
is
your
mistress
i
thought
she
was
with
you
sir
what
is
this
said
beale
stooped
and
picked
up
a
white
kid
glove
she
surely
has
gone
out
he
said
in
consternation
that
not
a
lady
glove
sir
said
the
girl
that
is
a
gentleman
it
was
a
new
glove
and
turning
it
over
he
saw
stamped
inside
the
words
glebler
rotterdam
has
anybody
been
here
he
asked
not
to
my
knowledge
sir
the
young
lady
told
me
she
did
not
want
me
any
more
the
girl
hesitated
it
seemed
a
veritable
betrayal
of
her
mistress
to
disclose
such
a
sordid
matter
as
the
search
for
a
pawn
ticket
beale
noticed
the
hesitation
you
must
tell
me
everything
and
tell
me
quickly
he
said
well
sir
said
the
maid
the
lady
came
in
to
look
for
something
she
brought
with
her
when
she
came
here
i
remember
cried
kitson
she
told
me
she
had
brought
away
something
very
curious
from
van
heerden
house
and
made
me
guess
what
it
was
something
interrupted
our
talk
what
was
it
well
sir
said
the
maid
resigned
i
wo
tell
you
a
lie
sir
it
was
a
pawn
ticket
a
pawn
ticket
cried
kitson
and
beale
in
unison
are
you
sure
asked
the
latter
absolutely
sure
sir
but
she
could
have
brought
a
pawn
ticket
from
van
heerden
house
what
was
it
for
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
what
was
on
the
pawn
ticket
said
kitson
impatiently
what
article
had
been
pledged
again
the
girl
hesitated
to
betray
her
mistress
was
unpleasant
to
betray
herself
as
she
would
if
she
confessed
that
she
had
most
carefully
and
thoroughly
read
the
voucher
was
unthinkable
you
know
what
was
on
it
said
beale
in
his
best
third
degree
manner
now
do
keep
us
waiting
what
was
it
a
watch
sir
how
much
was
it
pledged
for
ten
shillings
sir
do
you
remember
the
name
in
a
foreign
name
sir
van
horden
van
heerden
said
beale
quickly
and
at
what
pawnbrokers
well
sir
said
the
girl
making
a
fight
for
her
reputation
i
only
glanced
at
the
ticket
and
i
only
noticed
yes
you
did
interrupted
beale
sharply
you
read
every
line
of
it
where
was
it
rosenblaum
of
commercial
road
blurted
the
girl
any
number
i
did
see
the
number
you
will
find
them
in
the
telephone
book
said
kitson
what
does
it
mean
but
beale
was
to
kitson
arriving
there
in
time
to
meet
mcnorton
who
had
handed
over
his
charge
to
his
subordinate
i
found
it
cried
beale
found
what
asked
kitson
the
code
where
how
asked
mcnorton
unless
i
am
altogether
wrong
the
code
is
contained
either
engraved
on
the
case
or
written
on
a
slip
of
paper
enclosed
within
the
case
of
a
watch
ca
you
see
it
all
plainly
now
van
heerden
neither
trusted
his
memory
nor
his
subordinates
he
had
his
simple
code
written
as
we
shall
find
upon
thin
paper
enclosed
in
the
case
of
a
hunter
watch
and
this
he
pledged
a
pawnbroker
is
the
safest
of
safe
deposits
searching
for
clues
suppose
the
police
had
detected
his
preparations
the
pledged
ticket
might
have
been
easily
overlooked
kitson
was
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
amazed
indignation
here
was
a
man
who
had
lost
his
wife
and
kitson
believed
that
this
young
detective
loved
the
girl
as
few
women
are
loved
but
in
the
passion
of
the
chase
in
the
production
of
a
new
problem
he
was
absorbed
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
considerations
in
the
greater
game
yet
he
did
beale
an
injustice
if
he
only
knew
for
the
thought
of
oliva
new
peril
ran
through
all
his
speculations
his
rapid
deductions
his
lightning
plans
miss
cresswell
found
the
ticket
and
probably
extracted
it
as
a
curiosity
these
things
are
kept
in
little
envelopes
are
they
mcnorton
the
police
chief
nodded
that
was
it
then
she
took
it
out
and
left
the
envelope
behind
and
van
heerden
did
not
discover
his
loss
until
he
went
to
find
the
voucher
to
give
milsom
the
code
do
you
remember
in
the
first
place
he
said
he
could
give
him
the
code
until
after
ten
which
is
probably
the
hour
the
pawnbrokers
open
for
business
mcnorton
nodded
again
then
do
you
remember
that
milsom
said
that
the
code
was
not
irredeemably
lost
and
that
van
heerden
knew
where
it
was
in
default
of
finding
the
ticket
he
decided
to
burgle
the
pawnbroker
and
that
burglary
is
going
through
but
he
could
have
obtained
a
duplicate
of
the
ticket
said
mcnorton
how
asked
beale
quickly
by
going
before
a
magistrate
and
swearing
an
affidavit
in
his
own
name
said
beale
you
see
he
could
do
that
it
would
mean
walking
into
the
lion
den
no
burglary
was
his
only
chance
but
what
of
oliva
said
kitson
impatiently
i
tell
you
beale
i
am
not
big
enough
or
stoical
enough
to
think
outside
of
that
safety
beale
swung
round
at
him
you
do
think
i
forgotten
that
do
you
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
do
think
that
has
been
out
of
my
mind
his
face
was
tense
and
drawn
i
think
i
believe
that
oliva
is
safe
he
said
quietly
i
believe
that
oliva
and
not
any
of
us
here
will
deliver
van
heerden
to
justice
are
you
mad
asked
kitson
in
astonishment
i
am
very
sane
come
here
he
gripped
the
old
lawyer
by
the
arm
and
led
him
back
to
the
room
look
he
said
and
pointed
what
do
you
mean
the
bookshelf
beale
nodded
half
an
hour
ago
i
gave
oliva
a
book
he
said
that
book
is
no
longer
there
but
in
the
name
of
heaven
how
can
a
book
save
her
demanded
the
exasperated
kitson
stanford
beale
did
not
answer
yes
yes
she
safe
i
know
she
safe
he
said
if
oliva
is
the
girl
i
think
she
is
then
i
see

finish
chapter
xxxi
a
corn
chandler
bill
the
church
bells
were
chiming
eleven
when
a
car
drew
up
before
a
gloomy
corner
shop
bearing
the
dingy
sign
of
the
pawnbroker
calling
and
beale
and
mcnorton
alighted
it
was
a
main
street
and
was
almost
deserted
beale
looked
up
at
the
windows
they
were
dark
he
knocked
at
the
of
the
shop
and
presently
the
two
men
were
joined
by
a
policeman
nobody
lives
here
sir
explained
the
officer
when
mcnorton
had
made
himself
known
old
rosenblaum
runs
the
business
and
lives
at
highgate
he
flashed
his
lamp
upon
the
door
and
tried
it
but
it
did
not
yield
a
nightfarer
who
had
been
in
the
shade
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
came
across
and
volunteered
information
he
had
seen
another
car
drive
up
and
a
gentleman
had
alighted
he
had
opened
the
door
with
a
key
and
gone
in
there
was
nothing
suspicious
about
him
he
was
quite
a
gentleman
and
was
in
the
constable
thought
it
was
one
of
the
partners
of
rosenblaum
in
convivial
and
resplendent
garb
he
had
been
in
the
house
ten
minutes
then
had
come
out
again
locking
the
door
behind
him
and
had
driven
off
just
before
beale
car
had
arrived
it
was
not
until
half
an
hour
later
that
an
agitated
little
man
brought
by
the
police
from
highgate
admitted
the
two
men
there
was
no
need
to
make
a
long
search
the
moment
the
light
was
switched
on
in
the
shop
beale
made
his
discovery
on
the
broad
counter
lay
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
little
heap
of
silver
coins
he
swept
the
money
aside
and
read
for
the
redemption
of
one
silver
hunter
it
was
signed
in
the
characteristic
handwriting
that
beale
knew
so
well
van
heerden
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
what
do
you
make
of
that
asked
mcnorton
beale
carried
the
paper
to
the
light
and
examined
it
and
mcnorton
went
on
he
a
pretty
cool
fellow
i
suppose
he
had
the
money
and
the
message
all
ready
for
our
benefit
beale
shook
his
head
on
the
contrary
he
said
this
was
done
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
a
piece
of
bravado
which
occurred
to
him
when
he
had
the
watch
look
at
this
paper
you
can
imagine
him
searching
his
pocket
for
a
piece
of
waste
paper
and
taking
the
first
that
came
to
his
hand
it
is
written
in
ink
with
the
pawnbroker
own
pen
the
inkwell
is
open
he
lifted
up
the
pen
the
nib
is
still
wet
he
said
mcnorton
took
the
paper
from
his
hands
it
was
a
bill
from
a
at
horsham
the
type
of
bill
that
was
sent
in
days
of
war
economy
which
folded
over
and
constituted
its
own
envelope
it
was
addressed
to
j
b
harden
esq
that
was
the
he
used
when
he
took
the
wine
vaults
at
paddington
explained
mcnorton
and
had
been
posted
about
a
week
before
attached
to
the
bottom
of
the
account
which
was
for
was
a
little
slip
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
account
had
probably
been
overlooked
beale
finger
traced
the
item
for
which
the
bill
was
rendered
and
mcnorton
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
curious
is
it
said
beale
as
he
folded
the
paper
and
put
it
away
in
his
pocket
how
these
very
clever
men
always
make
some
trifling
error
which
brings
them
to
justice
i
do
know
how
many
great
schemes
i
have
seen
brought
to
nothing
through
some
such
act
of
folly
as
this
some
piece
of
theatrical
bravado
which
benefited
the
criminal
nothing
at
all
good
gracious
said
mcnorton
wonderingly
of
course
that
what
he
is
going
to
do
i
never
thought
of
that
it
is
in
the
neighbourhood
of
horsham
we
must
look
for
him
and
i
think
if
we
can
get
one
of
the
billingham
out
of
bed
in
a
couple
of
hours
time
we
shall
do
a
good
night
work
they
went
outside
and
again
questioned
the
policeman
he
remembered
the
car
turning
round
and
going
back
the
way
it
had
come
it
had
probably
taken
one
of
the
innumerable
which
lead
from
the
main
thoroughfare
and
in
this
way
they
had
missed
it
i
want
to
go
to
the
office
first
said
beale
i
have
some
good
friends
on
that
paper
and
i
am
curious
to
know
how
bad
the
markets
are
the
night
cables
from
new
york
should
be
coming
in
by
now
in
his
heart
was
a
sickening
fear
which
he
dared
not
express
what
would
the
morrow
bring
forth
if
this
one
man
cupidity
and
hate
should
succeed
in
releasing
the
terror
upon
the
world
what
sort
of
a
world
would
it
leave
through
the
windows
of
the
car
he
could
see
the
placid
policemen
patrolling
the
streets
caught
a
glimpse
of
other
cars
brilliantly
illuminated
bearing
their
laughing
men
and
women
back
to
homes
who
were
ignorant
of
the
monstrous
danger
which
threatened
their
security
and
life
he
passed
the
façades
of
great
commercial
mansions
which
in
a
time
might
but
serve
to
conceal
the
stark
ruin
within
to
him
it
was
a
night
of
tremendous
tragedy
and
for
the
second
time
in
his
life
in
the
numbness
induced
by
the
greater
peril
and
the
greater
anxiety
he
failed
to
wince
at
the
thought
of
the
danger
in
which
oliva
stood
indeed
analysing
his
sensations
she
seemed
to
him
on
this
occasion
less
a
victim
than
a
and
he
found
a
strange
comfort
in
that
thought
of
partnership
the
buildings
blazed
with
light
when
the
car
drew
up
to
the
door
were
hurrying
through
the
the
two
great
elevators
were
running
up
and
down
without
pause
the
grey
editor
with
a
gruff
voice
threw
over
a
bundle
of
flimsies
here
are
the
market
reports
he
growled
they
are
not
very
encouraging
beale
read
them
and
whistled
and
the
editor
eyed
him
keenly
well
what
do
you
make
of
it
he
asked
the
detective
wheat
at
a
shilling
a
pound
already
god
knows
what
it
going
to
be
any
other
news
asked
beale
we
have
asked
germany
to
explain
why
she
has
prohibited
the
export
of
wheat
and
to
give
us
a
reason
for
the
stocks
she
holds
and
the
steps
she
has
taken
during
the
past
two
months
to
accumulate
reserves
an
ultimatum
not
exactly
an
ultimatum
there
nothing
to
go
to
war
about
the
government
has
mobilized
the
fleet
and
the
french
government
has
partially
mobilized
her
army
the
question
is
he
said
would
war
ease
the
situation
beale
shook
his
head
the
battle
will
not
be
fought
in
the
field
he
said
it
will
be
fought
right
here
in
london
in
all
your
great
towns
in
manchester
coventry
birmingham
cardiff
it
will
be
fought
in
new
york
and
in
a
thousand
townships
between
the
pacific
and
the
atlantic
and
if
the
german
scheme
comes
off
we
shall
be
beaten
before
a
shot
is
fired
what
does
it
mean
asked
the
editor
why
is
everybody
buying
wheat
so
frantically
there
is
no
shortage
the
harvests
in
the
united
states
and
canada
are
good
there
will
be
no
harvests
said
beale
solemnly
and
the
journalist
gaped
at
him
chapter
xxxii
the
end
of
van
heerden
van
heerden
expected
many
things
and
was
prepared
for
contingencies
beyond
the
imagination
of
the
normally
minded
but
he
was
not
prepared
to
find
in
oliva
cresswell
a
pleasant
when
a
man
takes
a
girl
against
her
will
from
a
pleasant
suite
at
the
best
hotel
in
london
compels
her
at
the
peril
of
death
to
accompany
him
on
a
ride
in
the
dead
of
the
night
and
when
his
offence
is
a
duplication
of
one
which
had
been
committed
less
than
a
week
before
he
not
unnaturally
anticipates
tears
supplications
or
in
the
alternative
a
frigid
and
unapproachable
silence
to
his
amazement
oliva
was
extraordinarily
cheerful
and
talkative
and
even
amusing
he
had
kept
bridgers
at
the
door
of
the
car
whilst
he
investigated
the
establishment
of
rosenblaum
and
had
returned
in
triumph
to
discover
that
the
girl
who
up
to
then
had
been
taciturn
and
uncommunicative
was
in
quite
an
amiable
mood
i
used
to
think
she
said
that
abductions
were
the
invention
of
sensational
writers
but
you
seem
to
make
a
practice
of
it
you
are
not
very
original
van
heerden
i
think
i
told
you
that
before
he
smiled
in
the
darkness
as
the
car
sped
smoothly
through
the
deserted
streets
i
must
plead
guilty
to
being
rather
unoriginal
he
said
but
i
promise
you
that
this
little
adventure
shall
not
end
as
did
the
last
it
can
hardly
do
that
she
laughed
i
can
only
be
married
once
whilst
beale
is
alive
i
forgot
you
were
married
he
said
suddenly
then
after
a
pause
i
suppose
you
will
divorce
him
why
she
asked
innocently
but
you
not
fond
of
that
fellow
are
you
passionately
she
said
calmly
he
is
my
ideal
the
reply
took
away
his
breath
and
certainly
silenced
him
how
is
this
adventure
to
end
she
demanded
are
you
going
to
maroon
me
on
a
desert
island
or
are
you
taking
me
to
germany
how
did
you
know
i
am
trying
to
get
to
germany
he
asked
sharply
oh
beale
thought
so
she
replied
in
a
tone
of
indifference
he
reckoned
that
he
would
catch
you
somewhere
near
the
coast
he
did
did
he
said
the
other
calmly
i
shall
deny
him
that
pleasure
i
do
intend
taking
you
to
germany
indeed
it
is
not
my
intention
to
detain
you
any
longer
than
is
necessary
for
which
i
am
truly
grateful
she
smiled
but
why
detain
me
at
all
that
is
a
stupid
question
to
ask
when
i
am
sure
you
have
no
doubt
in
your
mind
as
to
why
it
is
necessary
to
keep
you
close
to
me
until
i
have
finished
my
work
i
think
i
told
you
some
time
ago
he
went
on
that
i
had
a
great
scheme
the
other
day
you
called
me
a
hun
by
which
i
suppose
you
meant
that
i
was
a
german
it
is
perfectly
true
that
i
am
a
german
and
i
am
a
patriotic
german
to
me
even
in
these
days
of
his
degradation
the
kaiser
is
still
little
less
than
a
god
his
voice
quivered
a
little
and
the
girl
was
struck
dumb
with
wonder
that
a
man
of
such
intelligence
of
such
a
wide
outlook
of
such
modernity
should
hold
to
views
so
archaic
your
country
ruined
germany
you
have
sucked
us
dry
to
say
that
i
hate
england
and
hate
america
for
you
are
one
in
your
soulless
covetousness
is
to
express
my
feelings
mildly
but
what
is
your
scheme
she
asked
briefly
i
will
tell
you
miss
cresswell
that
you
may
understand
that
you
accompany
history
and
are
a
participant
in
world
politics
america
and
england
are
going
to
pay
they
are
going
to
buy
corn
from
my
country
at
the
price
that
germany
can
fix
it
will
be
a
price
he
cried
and
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
his
joy
which
will
ruin
the
people
more
effectively
than
they
ruined
germany
but
how
she
asked
bewildered
they
are
going
to
buy
corn
he
repeated
at
our
price
corn
which
is
stored
in
germany
but
what
nonsense
she
said
scornfully
i
do
know
very
much
about
harvests
and
things
of
that
kind
but
i
know
that
most
of
the
wheat
comes
from
america
and
from
russia
the
russian
wheat
will
be
in
german
granaries
he
said
softly
the
american
wheat
there
will
be
no
american
wheat
and
then
his
calmness
deserted
him
the
story
of
the
green
rust
burst
out
in
a
wild
flood
of
language
which
was
and
the
man
was
beside
himself
almost
mad
and
before
his
gesticulating
hands
she
shrank
back
into
the
corner
of
the
car
she
saw
his
silhouette
against
the
window
heard
the
roar
and
scream
of
his
voice
as
he
babbled
incoherently
of
his
wonderful
scheme
and
had
to
piece
together
as
best
she
could
his
disconnected
narrative
and
then
she
remembered
her
work
in
beale
office
the
careful
tabulation
of
american
farms
the
names
of
the
sheriffs
the
hotels
where
conveyances
might
be
secured
so
that
was
it
beale
had
discovered
the
plot
and
had
already
moved
to
counter
this
devilish
plan
and
she
remembered
the
man
who
had
come
to
her
room
in
mistake
for
van
heerden
and
the
phial
of
green
sawdust
he
carried
and
beale
look
of
horror
when
he
examined
it
and
suddenly
she
cried
with
such
vehemence
that
his
flood
of
talk
was
stopped
thank
god
oh
thank
god
what
what
do
you
mean
he
demanded
suspiciously
what
are
you
thanking
god
about
oh
nothing
nothing
she
was
her
eager
animated
self
tell
me
some
more
it
is
a
wonderful
story
it
is
true
is
it
not
true
he
laughed
harshly
you
shall
see
how
true
it
is
you
shall
see
the
world
lie
at
the
feet
of
german
science
the
word
will
go
forth
look
he
clicked
on
a
little
electric
light
and
held
out
his
hand
in
his
palm
lay
a
silver
watch
i
told
you
there
was
a
code
she
was
dimly
conscious
that
he
had
spoken
of
a
code
but
she
had
been
so
occupied
by
her
own
thoughts
that
she
had
not
caught
all
that
he
had
said
that
code
was
in
this
watch
look
he
pressed
a
knob
and
the
case
flew
open
pasted
to
the
inside
of
the
case
was
a
circular
piece
of
paper
covered
with
fine
writing
when
you
found
that
ticket
you
had
the
code
in
your
hands
he
chuckled
if
you
or
your
friends
had
the
sense
to
redeem
that
watch
i
could
not
have
sent
the
message
of
german
liberation
see
it
is
very
simple
he
pointed
with
his
finger
and
held
the
watch
to
the
roof
that
the
light
might
better
reveal
the
wording
this
word
means
it
will
go
to
all
my
chief
agents
they
will
transmit
it
by
telegram
to
hundreds
of
centres
by
thursday
morning
great
stretches
of
territory
where
the
golden
corn
was
waving
so
proudly
will
be
blackened
wastes
by
saturday
the
world
will
confront
its
sublime
catastrophe
but
why
have
you
three
words
she
asked
huskily
we
germans
provide
against
all
contingencies
he
said
we
leave
nothing
to
chance
we
are
not
gamblers
we
work
on
lines
of
scientific
accuracy
the
second
word
is
to
tell
my
agents
to
suspend
operations
until
they
hear
from
me
the
third
word
means
the
scheme
for
this
year
we
must
work
with
the
markets
a
more
favourable
opportunity
might
occur
with
so
grand
a
conception
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
obtain
the
maximum
results
for
our
labours
he
snapped
the
case
of
the
watch
and
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
turned
out
the
light
and
settled
himself
back
with
a
sigh
of
content
you
see
you
are
unimportant
he
said
you
are
a
beautiful
woman
and
to
many
men
you
would
be
most
desirable
to
me
you
are
just
a
woman
an
ordinary
amusing
beautiful
possessed
of
an
agile
mind
though
somewhat
frivolous
by
our
standards
many
of
my
who
do
not
think
like
i
do
would
take
you
it
is
my
intention
to
leave
you
just
as
soon
as
it
is
safe
to
do
so
unless
a
thought
struck
him
and
he
frowned
unless
she
repeated
with
a
sinking
heart
in
spite
of
her
assurance
bridgers
was
speaking
to
me
of
you
he
who
is
driving
he
nodded
to
the
dimly
outlined
shoulders
of
the
chauffeur
he
has
been
a
faithful
fellow
you
would
she
gasped
why
not
he
said
coolly
i
do
want
you
bridgers
thinks
that
you
are
beautiful
is
he
a
hun
too
she
asked
and
he
jerked
round
toward
her
if
bridgers
wants
you
he
shall
have
you
he
said
harshly
she
knew
she
had
made
a
mistake
there
was
no
sense
in
antagonizing
him
the
more
especially
so
since
she
had
not
yet
learnt
all
that
she
wanted
to
know
i
think
your
scheme
is
horrible
she
said
after
awhile
the
wheat
destruction
scheme
i
mean
not
bridgers
but
it
is
a
very
great
one
the
man
was
susceptible
to
flattery
for
he
became
genial
again
it
is
the
greatest
scheme
that
has
ever
been
known
to
science
it
is
the
most
colossal
crime
i
suppose
they
will
call
it
a
crime
that
has
ever
been
committed
but
how
are
you
going
to
get
your
code
word
away
the
telegraphs
are
in
the
hands
of
the
government
and
i
think
you
will
find
it
difficult
even
if
you
have
a
secret
wireless
wireless
bah
he
said
scornfully
i
never
expected
to
send
it
by
telegraph
with
or
without
wires
i
have
a
much
surer
way
fräulein
as
you
will
see
but
how
will
you
escape
she
asked
i
shall
leave
england
soon
after
daybreak
he
replied
with
assurance
by
aeroplane
a
will
land
on
my
sussex
farm
which
will
have
british
markings
indeed
it
is
already
in
england
and
i
and
my
good
bridgers
will
pass
your
coast
without
trouble
he
peered
out
of
the
window
this
is
horsham
i
think
he
said
as
they
swept
through
what
appeared
to
the
girl
to
be
a
square
that
little
building
on
the
left
is
the
railway
station
you
will
see
the
signal
lamps
in
a
moment
my
farm
is
about
five
miles
down
the
shoreham
road
he
was
in
an
excellent
temper
as
they
passed
through
the
old
town
and
mounted
the
hill
which
leads
to
shoreham
was
politeness
itself
when
the
car
had
turned
off
the
main
road
and
had
bumped
over
cart
tracks
to
the
door
of
a
large
building
this
is
your
last
escapade
miss
cresswell
or
beale
i
suppose
i
should
call
you
he
said
jovially
as
he
pushed
her
before
him
into
a
room
where
supper
had
been
laid
for
two
you
see
you
were
not
expected
but
you
shall
have
bridgers
it
will
be
daylight
in
two
hours
he
said
inconsequently
you
must
have
some
wine
she
shook
her
head
with
a
smile
and
he
laughed
as
if
the
implied
suspicion
of
her
refusal
was
the
best
joke
in
the
world
nein
nein
little
friend
he
said
i
shall
not
doctor
you
again
my
days
of
doctoring
have
passed
she
had
expected
to
find
the
farm
in
occupation
but
apparently
they
were
the
only
people
there
the
doctor
had
opened
the
door
himself
with
a
key
and
no
servant
had
appeared
nor
apparently
did
he
expect
them
to
appear
she
learnt
afterwards
that
there
were
two
farm
servants
an
old
man
and
his
wife
who
lived
in
a
cottage
on
the
estate
and
came
in
the
daytime
to
do
the
housework
and
prepare
a
cold
supper
against
their
master
coming
bridgers
did
not
make
his
appearance
apparently
he
was
staying
with
his
car
about
three
in
the
morning
when
the
first
streaks
of
grey
were
showing
in
the
sky
van
heerden
rose
to
go
in
search
of
his
assistant
until
then
he
had
not
ceased
to
talk
of
himself
of
his
scheme
of
his
great
plan
of
his
early
struggles
of
his
difficulties
in
persuading
members
of
his
government
to
afford
him
the
assistance
he
required
as
he
turned
to
the
door
she
checked
him
with
a
word
i
am
immensely
interested
she
said
but
still
you
have
not
told
me
how
you
intend
to
send
your
message
it
is
simple
he
said
and
beckoned
to
her
they
passed
out
of
the
house
into
the
chill
sweet
dawn
made
a
of
the
farm
and
came
to
a
courtyard
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
low
buildings
he
opened
a
door
to
reveal
another
door
covered
with
wire
netting
behold
he
laughed
pigeons
said
the
girl
the
dark
interior
of
the
shed
was
aflicker
with
white
wings
pigeons
repeated
van
heerden
closing
the
door
and
every
one
knows
his
way
back
to
germany
it
has
been
a
labour
of
love
collecting
them
and
they
are
all
british
he
said
with
a
laugh
there
i
will
give
the
british
credit
they
know
more
about
pigeons
than
we
germans
and
have
used
them
more
in
the
war
but
suppose
your
pigeon
is
shot
down
or
falls
by
the
way
she
asked
as
they
walked
slowly
back
to
the
house
i
shall
send
fifty
replied
van
heerden
calmly
each
will
carry
the
same
message
and
some
at
least
will
get
home
back
in
the
he
cleared
the
remains
of
the
supper
from
the
table
and
went
out
of
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
returning
with
a
small
pad
of
paper
and
she
saw
from
the
delicacy
with
which
he
handed
each
sheet
that
it
was
of
the
thinnest
texture
between
each
page
he
placed
a
carbon
and
began
to
write
printing
the
characters
there
was
only
one
word
on
each
tiny
sheet
when
this
was
written
he
detached
the
leaves
putting
them
aside
and
using
his
watch
as
a
and
wrote
another
batch
she
watched
him
fascinated
until
he
showed
signs
that
he
had
completed
his
task
then
she
lifted
the
little
valise
which
she
had
at
her
side
put
it
on
her
knees
opened
it
and
took
out
a
book
it
must
have
been
instinct
which
made
him
raise
his
eyes
to
her
what
have
you
got
there
he
asked
sharply
oh
a
book
she
said
with
an
attempt
at
carelessness
but
why
have
you
got
it
out
you
are
not
reading
he
leant
over
and
snatched
it
from
her
and
looked
at
the
title
friend
in
need
he
read
by
stanford
beale
by
stanford
beale
he
repeated
frowning
i
did
know
your
husband
wrote
books
she
made
no
reply
he
turned
back
the
cover
and
read
the
title
page
but
this
is
self
help
he
said
it
the
same
thing
she
replied
he
turned
another
page
or
two
then
stopped
for
he
had
come
to
a
place
where
the
centre
of
the
book
had
been
cut
right
out
the
leaves
had
been
glued
together
to
disguise
this
fact
and
what
was
apparently
a
book
was
in
reality
a
small
box
what
was
in
there
he
asked
springing
to
his
feet
this
she
said
do
move
van
heerden
the
little
hand
which
held
the
browning
was
firm
and
did
not
quiver
i
do
think
you
are
going
to
send
your
pigeons
off
this
morning
doctor
she
said
stand
back
from
the
table
she
leant
over
and
seized
the
little
heap
of
papers
and
the
watch
i
am
going
to
shoot
you
she
said
steadily
if
you
refuse
to
do
as
i
tell
you
because
if
i
do
shoot
you
you
will
kill
me
his
face
had
grown
old
and
grey
in
the
space
of
a
few
seconds
the
white
hands
he
raised
were
shaking
he
tried
to
speak
but
only
a
hoarse
murmur
came
then
his
face
went
blank
he
stared
at
the
pistol
then
stretched
out
his
hands
slowly
toward
it
stand
back
she
cried
he
jumped
at
her
and
she
pulled
the
trigger
but
nothing
happened
and
the
next
minute
she
was
struggling
in
his
arms
the
man
was
hysterical
with
fear
and
relief
and
was
giggling
and
cursing
in
the
same
breath
he
wrenched
the
pistol
from
her
hand
and
threw
it
on
the
table
you
fool
you
fool
he
shouted
the
you
did
put
it
down
she
could
have
wept
with
anger
and
mortification
beale
had
put
the
catch
of
the
weapon
at
safety
not
realizing
that
she
did
not
understand
the
mechanism
of
it
and
van
heerden
in
one
lightning
glance
had
seen
his
advantage
now
you
suffer
he
said
as
he
flung
her
in
a
chair
you
shall
suffer
i
tell
you
i
will
make
an
example
of
you
i
will
leave
your
husband
something
which
he
will
not
touch
he
was
shaking
in
every
limb
he
dashed
to
the
door
and
bellowed
bridgers
presently
she
heard
a
footstep
in
the
hall
come
my
friend
van
heerden
shouted
you
shall
have
your
wish
it
is
how
are
you
going
van
heerden
quietly
or
rough
he
spun
round
there
were
two
men
in
the
doorway
and
the
first
of
these
was
beale
it
no
use
your
shouting
for
bridgers
because
bridgers
is
on
the
way
to
the
jug
said
mcnorton
i
have
a
warrant
for
you
van
heerden
the
doctor
turned
with
a
howl
of
rage
snatched
up
the
pistol
which
lay
on
the
table
and
thumbed
down
the
beale
and
mcnorton
fired
together
so
that
it
seemed
like
a
single
shot
that
thundered
through
the
room
van
heerden
slid
forward
and
fell
sprawling
across
the
table
it
was
the
friday
morning
and
beale
stepped
briskly
through
the
vestibule
of
the
and
declining
the
elevator
went
up
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
he
burst
into
the
room
where
kitson
and
the
girl
were
standing
by
the
window
wheat
prices
are
tumbling
down
he
said
the
message
worked
thank
heaven
for
that
said
kitson
then
van
heerden
code
message
telling
his
gang
to
stop
operations
reached
its
destination
its
destinations
corrected
beale
cheerfully
i
released
thirty
pigeons
with
the
magic
word
the
agents
have
been
arrested
he
said
we
notified
the
government
authorities
and
there
was
a
sheriff
or
a
policeman
in
every
post
office
when
the
code
word
came
through
van
heerden
agents
saw
some
curious
telegraph
messengers
yesterday
kitson
nodded
and
turned
away
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
asked
the
girl
with
a
light
in
her
eyes
you
must
feel
quite
lost
without
this
great
quest
of
yours
there
are
others
said
stanford
beale
when
do
you
return
to
america
she
asked
he
fenced
the
question
but
she
brought
him
back
to
it
i
have
a
great
deal
of
business
to
do
in
london
before
i
go
he
said
like
what
she
asked
well
he
hesitated
i
have
some
legal
business
are
you
suing
somebody
she
asked
wilfully
dense
he
rubbed
his
head
in
perplexity
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
said
i
do
exactly
know
what
i
got
to
do
or
what
sort
of
figure
i
shall
cut
i
have
never
been
in
the
divorce
court
before
divorce
court
she
said
puzzled
are
you
giving
evidence
of
course
i
know
detectives
do
that
sort
of
thing
i
have
read
about
it
in
the
newspapers
it
must
be
rather
horrid
but
you
are
such
a
clever
detective
oh
by
the
way
you
never
told
me
how
you
found
me
it
was
a
very
simple
matter
he
said
relieved
to
change
the
subject
van
heerden
by
one
of
those
curious
lapses
which
the
best
of
criminals
make
left
a
message
at
the
pawnbroker
which
was
written
on
the
back
of
an
account
for
pigeon
food
sent
to
him
from
a
horsham
tradesman
i
knew
he
would
not
try
to
dispatch
his
message
by
the
ordinary
courses
and
i
suspected
all
along
that
he
had
established
a
the
bill
gave
me
all
the
information
i
wanted
it
took
us
a
long
time
to
find
the
tradesman
but
once
we
had
discovered
him
he
directed
us
to
the
farm
we
took
along
a
couple
of
local
policemen
and
arrested
bridgers
in
the
garage
she
shivered
it
was
horrible
was
it
she
said
he
nodded
it
was
rather
dreadful
but
it
might
have
been
very
much
worse
he
added
philosophically
but
how
wonderful
of
you
to
switch
yourself
from
the
crime
of
that
enthralling
character
to
a
commonplace
divorce
suit
this
is
commonplace
he
said
it
is
rather
a
curious
story
do
tell
me
she
made
a
place
for
him
on
the
and
he
sat
down
beside
her
it
is
a
story
of
a
mistake
and
a
blunder
he
said
the
plaintiff
a
very
worthy
young
man
passably
good
looking
was
a
man
of
my
profession
a
detective
engaged
in
protecting
the
interests
of
a
young
and
beautiful
girl
i
suppose
you
have
to
say
she
young
and
beautiful
or
the
story
would
be
interesting
she
said
it
is
not
necessary
to
lie
in
this
case
he
said
she
is
certainly
young
and
undoubtedly
beautiful
she
has
the
loveliest
eyes
go
on
she
said
hastily
the
detective
he
resumed
hereinafter
called
the
petitioner
desiring
to
protect
the
innocent
maiden
from
the
machinations
of
a
gentleman
no
longer
with
us
contracted
as
he
thought
a
fraudulent
marriage
with
this
unfortunate
girl
believing
thereby
he
could
choke
off
the
villain
who
was
pursuing
her
but
why
did
the
unfortunate
girl
marry
him
even
fraudulently
because
said
beale
the
villain
of
the
piece
had
drugged
her
and
she
did
know
what
she
was
doing
after
the
marriage
he
went
on
he
discovered
that
so
far
from
being
illegal
it
was
good
in
law
and
he
had
bound
this
wretched
female
please
do
be
rude
she
said
he
had
bound
this
wretched
female
to
him
for
life
being
a
perfect
gentleman
born
of
poor
but
american
parents
he
takes
the
first
opportunity
of
freeing
her
and
himself
she
murmured
as
to
the
poor
misguided
lad
he
said
firmly
you
need
feel
no
sympathy
he
had
behaved
disgracefully
how
she
asked
well
you
see
he
had
already
fallen
in
love
with
her
and
that
made
his
offence
all
the
greater
if
you
go
red
i
can
not
tell
you
this
story
because
it
embarrasses
me
i
have
gone
red
she
denied
indignantly
so
what
are
you
what
is
he
going
to
do
beale
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
is
going
to
work
for
a
divorce
but
why
she
demanded
what
has
she
done
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
what
do
you
mean
he
stammered
well
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
slightly
and
smiled
in
his
face
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
nothing
to
do
with
him
it
is
the
wretched
female
who
should
sue
for
a
divorce
not
the
handsome
detective
do
you
feel
faint
no
he
said
hoarsely
do
you
agree
with
me
i
agree
with
you
said
the
incoherent
beale
but
suppose
her
guardian
takes
the
necessary
steps
she
shook
her
head
the
guardian
can
do
nothing
unless
the
wretched
female
instructs
him
she
said
does
it
occur
to
you
that
even
the
best
of
drugs
wear
off
in
time
and
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
lady
was
not
as
unconscious
of
the
ceremony
as
she
pretends
of
course
she
said
hurriedly
she
did
not
realize
that
it
had
actually
happened
and
until
she
was
told
by
apollo
from
the
central
office
that
what
you
call
scotland
yard
in
new
york
is
it
that
the
ceremony
had
actually
occurred
she
was
under
the
impression
that
it
was
a
beautiful
dream
when
i
say
beautiful
she
amended
in
some
hurry
i
mean
not
unpleasant
then
what
am
i
to
do
said
the
helpless
beale
wait
till
i
divorce
you
said
oliva
and
turned
her
head
hurriedly
so
that
beale
only
kissed
the
tip
of
her
ear
the
end
