the

off

he
yelled
something
terrible
must
have
happened
or
marshal
crow
would
be
summoned
in
any
such
imperative
manner
as
this
in
the
centre
of
this
group
was
the
new
candidate
for
town
marshal
harry
squires
stepped
to
the
front
of
the
platform
when
they
appeared
on
the
street
together
he
altered
his
course
and
as
she
passed
him
the
flat
of
the
spade
landed
with
impelling
force
eight
or
ten
people
were
congregated
in
front
of
the
fry
house

veiled
lady
made
her
daily
excursions
in

big
car
yanking
open
the
he
plunged
headlong
into
the
softly
lighted
veranda
he
was
surrounded
by
conquerors

him

two
men
with
pistols
levelled
at
the
white
terrified
face

monkey
with
that
trunk
his
wife
was
now
standing
guard
over
it
on
the
porch
of
the
grand
view
hotel
these
smiling
complacent
women
formed
the
death
watch
that
was
to
witness
the
swift
inevitable
finish
of

sunlight

at
the
trial

was
shamelessly
complimentary
about

i
am
going
to
reveal
to
you
the
true
facts
in
the
case
of
our
late
lamented
friend
jake
miller
anderson
crow
detective
a
night
to
be
remembered
two
events
of
great
importance
took
place
in
tinkletown
on
the
night
of
may
the
first
occurring
at
ten
was
of
sufficient
consequence
to
rouse
the
entire
population
out
of
bed
thereby
creating
a
situation
almost
unique
which
allowed
every
one
in
town
to
participate
in
all
the
thrills
of
the
second
when
the
history
of
tinkletown
is
written
and
it
is
said
to
be
well
under
way
at
the
hands
of
that
estimable
authoress
miss
sue
becker
some
fifty
years
a
resident
of
the
town
and
the
of
one
of
its
founders
when
this
history
is
written
the
night
of
may
will
assert
itself
with
something
of
the
same
insistence
that
causes
the
world
to
refresh
its
memory
occasionally
by
looking
into
the
encyclopedia
to
determine
the
exact
date
of
the
fall
of
the
bastile
the
atop
the
town
hall
heralded
the
first
event
and
two
small
boys
gave
notice
of
the
second
smock
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
was
in
flames
and
with
a
high
wind
blowing
from
the
west
the
congregational
and
baptist
churches
the
high
school
pratt
photograph
gallery
and
the
two
houses
were
threatened
with
destruction
as
anderson
crow
now
deputy
marshal
of
the
town
declared
the
instant
he
arrived
at
the
scene
of
the
conflagration
nothing
but
the
most
heroic
and
indefatigable
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
volunteer
could
save
the
town
only
he
put
it
in
this
way
we
have
another
chicago
fire
here
sure
as
you
born
unless
it
rains
or
the
wind
changes
mighty
sudden
so
we
got
to
fight
hard
boys
crow
also
deputy
superintendent
of
the
was
late
in
getting
to
the
back
of
the
town
hall
so
late
that
the
and
manned
by
volunteers
who
had
waited
as
long
as
advisable
were
belabouring
the
fire
with
water
some
time
before
he
reached
the
this
irritated
crow
considerably
he
was
out
of
breath
when
he
got
to
the
elevator
or
some
one
would
have
heard
from
him
another
cause
of
annoyance
was
the
fact
that
his
rubber
coat
and
helmet
went
with
the
and
were
by
this
time
adorning
the
person
of
an
energetic
who
had
no
official
right
to
them
after
a
diligent
search
crow
located
his
regalia
and
commanded
the
wearer
one
patrick
murphy
to
hand
over
at
once
what
patrick
murphy
a
recent
arrival
at
tinkletown
said
in
response
to
this
demand
was
lost
in
the
roar
of
the
flames
so
anderson
put
his
hand
to
his
ear
and
shouted
what
say
patrick
repeated
his
remark
with
great
vigour
and
crow
apparently
catching
no
more
than
the
final
word
in
the
sentence
moved
hastily
away
but
not
before
agreeing
with
murphy
that
it
as
hot
as
the
place
he
mentioned
ed
higgins
the
man
was
in
charge
of
the
who
were
industriously
throwing
a
single
stream
of
water
from
the
into
the
vast
and
towering
conflagration
it
was
like
tossing
a
pint
of
water
into
the
atlantic
ocean
got
her
under
control
roared
anderson
bristling
up
to
ed
sure
shouted
ed
she
workin
beautiful
just
look
at
that
stream
you
i
mean
the
fire
bellowed
anderson
oh

thought

till

derned
warehouse

down
gee
whiz

long
as

anderson
answer
i

been
the
first
man

if
i
had
waited
nigh
onto
half
an
hour
trying
to
get

you
got
any
brains
ed
higgins
my
wife
been
chief
ever
since

was
elected
marshal
last
month
an
you
know
it
that
what
we
get
fer
lettin
the
women
vote
an
have
a
hand
in
the
affairs
of
the
nation
she
just
would
get
up
so
i
had
to
come
off
without
her
where
my
trumpet
we
got
to
get
this
fire
under
control
or
the
whole
town
will
go
gosh
if
it
only
rain
looked
a
little
like
rain
this
evenin
this
wind
may
be
bringin
up
a
storm
or
here
your
trumpet
crow
screeched
a
small
boy
bursting
through
the
crowd
half
of
the
inhabitants
of
tinkletown
stood
outside
of
the
rim
of
heat
and
watched
the
fire
while
the
other
half
in
all
stages
of
deshabille
remained
in
their
front
yards
training
the
garden
hose
on
the
roofs
and
sides
of
their
houses
and
yelling
to
every
speeding
to
telephone
to
the
commissioner
of
to
turn
on
more
pressure
among
his
other
offices
crow
was
commissioner
of
having
held
over
in
that
office
because
the
board
of
selectmen
forgot
to
appoint
any
one
else
in
his
place
after
the
last
election
and
while
a
great
many
citizens
carried
the
complaint
of
the
handlers
to
the
commissioner
it
is
doubtful
if
he
heard
them
above
the
combined
sound
of
his
own
voice
and
the
roar
of
the
flames
possessed
of
his
trumpet
the
redoubtable
crow
took
his
stand
beside
the
old
and
gave
orders
right
and
left
in
a
valiant
but
thoroughly
cracked
voice
now
we
git
her
out
panted
alf
reesling
the
town
drunkard
speaking
to
father
maloney
the
catholic
priest
who
was
taking
a
turn
with
him
at
the
pumping
apparatus
ed
all
right
but
it
takes
anderson
to
handle
a
fire
as
she
ought
to
be
handled
father
maloney
perspiring
copiously
and
breathing
with
great
difficulty
grunted
without
conviction
leetle
more
there
men
shouted
anderson
directing
his
command
to
the
futile
pumpers

to
get
water

to
that
winder
more
steam

bill
jackson

if
you
hit
her
a
fusillade
of
stones
left
the
hands
of
a
score
of
small
boys
and
clattered
against
the
walls
of
the
doomed
warehouse
some
of
them
coming
as
near
as
ten
feet
to
the
objective
two
of
them
being
so
wide
of
the
mark
that
simultaneous
ejaculations
of
surprise
and
pain
issued
from
the
lips
of
miss
spratt
and
professor
smith
both
of
the
high
school
the
heat
was
intense
blistering
reluctantly
the
crowd
awed
and
fascinated
by
the
greatest
blaze
it
had
ever
seen
not
even
excepting
the
burning
of
eliphalet
loop
in
edged
farther
and
farther
away
pursued
by
the
relentless
the
withdrew
in
good
order
obeying
the
instinct
of
somewhat
in
advance
of
the
command
of
their
superior
who
indeed
had
anticipated
such
a
man
oe
uvre
by
taking
a
position
from
which
he
could
the
retreat
by
the
time
the
fire
was
at
its
height
lighting
the
way
clear
to
heaven
according
to
miss
sue
becker
who
had
to
borrow
marshal
crow
pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper
from
mort
fryback
so
that
she
could
jot
down
the
beautiful
thought
before
it
perished
in
the
turmoil
of
frightfulness
more
men
roared
anderson
she
get
ahead
of
us
if
we
let
up
for
a
second
pump
pump
and
pump
they
did
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
stream
of
water
from
the
nozzle
in
the
hands
of
ed
higgins
and
petey
cicotte
was
now
falling
short
of
the
building
by
some
twenty
or
thirty
feet
serves
old
man
smock
right
declared
anderson
in
wrath
addressing
the
town
clerk
and
two
selectmen
who
by
virtue
of
office
retained
advantageous
positions
in
the
front
rank
of
spectators
if
he
done
as
i
told
him

paid
fer

extended
as
fer

harry
harry
squires
the
reporter
for

said
anderson
magnanimously
i

that
way

they

the
engine
and
every
foot
of
hose

much
by

dryly
i

says
there
were
fifty
thousand
bushels
of
wheat
in
the
bins
waiting
for
cars
to
take
it
down
to
new
york
every
bushel
of
it
was
going
abroad

of
an
idea

nut

the
fact

grain
was
to
go
to
the
allies
anderson
inquired
harry
the
harassed
marshal
scratched
his
head

set
on

ed
higgins
without
pausing

come
along
anderson
she
beginning
to
bulge
something
awful
anderson
crow
arose
to
the
occasion
lively
now
he
barked
through
the
trumpet
get
that
hose
and
engine
back
to
a
safe
place
ca
you
see
the
wall
about
ready
to
fall
everybody
fall
back
women
and
children
first
women
first
remember
down
the
road
fled
the
crowd
looking
over
its
collective
shoulders
so
to
speak
followed
by
the
venerable
fire
apparatus
and
the
still
more
venerable
harry
squires
in
his
account
of
the
fire
in
the
dilated
upon
the
fact
that
the
women
failed
to
retain
the
advantage
so
gallantly
extended
by
the
men
for
the
matter
of
about
ten
or
fifteen
yards
they
first
after
which
being
handicapped
by
petticoats
they
fell
ingloriously
behind
some
of
the
older
ones
maliciously
he
feared
impeded
the
progress
of
their
protectors
by
neglecting
to
get
out
of
the
way
in
time
with
the
result
that
at
least
two
men
were
severely
bruised
by
falling
over
them
the
case
of
uncle
dad
simms
being
a
particularly
sad
one
he
collided
with
the
portly
loop
and
failing
to
budge
her
suffered
the
temporary
loss
of
a
full
set
of
teeth
and
nearly
twenty
minutes
of
consciousness
squires
went
on
to
say
that
the
only
thing
that
saved
simms
from
being
run
over
and
killed
by
the
was
the
fact
that
the
latter
was
about
a
block
and
a
half
ahead
of
him
when
the
accident
occurred
sparks
soared
high
and
far
on
the
wind
scurrying
townward
across
the
barren
the
vast
canopy
was
red
with
the
glow
of
flying
embers
and
clouds
below
in
the
dusty
road
swarmed
the
long
procession
of
citizens
grim
stark
hemlocks
gleamed
in
the
weird
uncanny
light
that
turned
the
green
of
their
foliage
and
the
black
of
their
trunks
into
the
colour
of
the
rose
on
the
side
facing
the
fire
but
left
them
dark
and
forbidding
on
the
other
the
beyond
the
burning
warehouse
lining
the
railroad
spur
that
ventured
down
from
the
main
line
some
miles
away
and
terminated
at
smock
loomed
up
like
lofty
gibbets
in
the
ghastly
light
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
the
scene
of
the
conflagration
lay
the
homes
of
the
people
who
lived
on
the
rim
of
tinkletown
and
there
also
were
the
two
churches
and
the
houses
we
got
to
save
them
panted
anderson
and
then
in
hasty
apology
and
the
churches
too
you
got
to
save
my
studio

bawled

to
keep
pace
with
him
in
the
congested
line
halt
commanded
the
chief
not
because
tactics
called
for
such
an
action
but
because
he
was
beginning
to
feel
that
he
could
keep
up
with
the
engine
the
cavalcade
eased
down
to
a
walk
and
finally
came
to
a
halt
every
eye
was
riveted
on
the
burning
structure
which
now
stood
out
alone
in
all
its
grandeur
beyond
the
quarries
and
every
one
waited
in
breathless
suspense
for
the
collapse
of
the
towering
walls
a
shrill
boyish
voice
broke
out
above
the
subdued
chatter
of
the
crowd
where
crow
crow
where
are
you
sh
hissed
alf
reesling
glowering
upon
the
excited
boy
who
had
just
come
up
at
full
speed
from
the
direction
of
the
town
do
you
make
so
much
noise
the
walls
are
going
to
cave
in
an
where
mr
crow
panted
the
boy
a
lad
of
twelve
his
eyes
appeared
starting
from
his
head
a
second
boy
joined
him
and
he
was
trembling
so
violently
that
he
could
not
speak
at
all
all
he
could
do
was
to
point
at
the
lank
figure
of
the
old
town
marshal
some
distance
back
in
the
crowd
three
seconds
later
the
two
youngsters
had
the
ear
of
anderson
crow
and
between
them
they
poured
it
full
of
news
of
the
most
extraordinary
character
the
crowd
forgetting
the
imminent
crash
of
the
warehouse
wall
pressed
eagerly
forward
wait
a
second
wait
a
second
roared
anderson
one
at
a
time

protested
bud
and
there
might
have
been
something
more
sanguinary
than
mere
words
if
marshal
crow
had
not
interfered
none
o
that
now
what
the
matter
bud
somethin
turrible

happened

the
boy
if

yesterday

to
some
devilment

desperit
villains

cried
the
other
lad
seizing
his
opportunity
there
two
three
or
four
more
fellers
from
the
outside
come
up
an
busted
in
the
door
an
out
then
they
all
run
down
the
street
to
where
the
new
bank
is
me
an
bud
seen
some
of
climb
into
one
of
the
winders
of
the
bank
an
nen
we
struck
out
to
find
you
crow
we
thought
maybe
you
like
to
know
what
the
rest
of
roswell
narrative
was
lost
in
the
hullabaloo
of
command
and
action
the
fickle
populace
turned
its
back
on
the
burning
warehouse
and
swept
down
the
lane
in
quest
of
new
excitement
the
tottering
wall
came
down
with
a
crash
but
its
fall
was
unwitnessed
except
by
those
infirm
old
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
had
lagged
so
far
behind
in
the
first
rush
for
safety
that
they
were
still
in
ignorance
of
the
latest
calamity
it
was
a
pity
wrote
miss
sue
becker
in
her
diary
that
the
gods
crowded
so
much
into
a
single
night
when
there
were
three
hundred
and
more
perfectly
good
nights
available
the
story
of
the
two
boys
proved
not
only
to
be
true
but
also
woefully
lacking
in
exaggeration
the
and
the
looting
of
the
first
national
bank
of
tinkletown
turned
out
to
be
but
two
in
a
long
and
fairly
complete
list
of
disasters
investigation
revealed
an
astonishing
thoroughness
and
impartiality
on
the
part
of
the
bandits
the
safe
in
brubaker
drugstore
was
missing
with
something
like
nineteen
dollars
in
cash
lamson
store
had
been
entered
and
the
rifled
fryback
higgins
and
rush
applegate
were
visited
and
as
harry
squires
said
in
the
contents
noted
two
shoes
and
a
couple
of
inner
tubes
were
missing
from
universal
garage
and
ed
higgins
dog
was
slain
in
cold
blood
by
the
remorseless
ravagers
nobody
went
to
sleep
that
night
everybody
joined
in
the
search
for
the
robbers
citizens
hurried
home
after
the
first
alarm
and
did
their
part
by
looking
under
every
bed
in
their
houses
after
which
the
more
venturesome
visited
garrets
cellars
and
woodsheds
anderson
crow
after
organizing
a
large
posse
and
commandeering
several
automobiles
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
left
his
silver
watch
and
a
wallet
containing
eleven
dollars
under
his
pillow
he
drove
home
as
rapidly
as
possible
in
john
blosser
and
was
considerably
aggravated
to
find
his
wife
sound
asleep
he
awoke
her
with
some
rudeness
wake
up
eva
consarn
it
do
you
know
the
town
full
of
highwaymen
it
be
just
like
you
to
sleep

a
log
and
let

cried
his
wife
sitting
up
in
bed
and
staring
at
him
in
alarm
dozens
of
he
declared
pocketing
his
watch
and
wallet

and
help

new
york
on
business
an
he
never
brought
it
back
he
never
did
anderson
opinion
of
milt
cupples
was
smothered
in
a
violent
chorus
of
automobile
horns
crow
promptly
covered
her
head
with
the
and
let
out
a
muffled
shriek
it
only

was
moving
toward
the
front
gate
caroline
paraphrase
pursued
him
and
left
a
sting
what
is
home
without
a
father
followed
now
a
lengthy
and
at
times
acrimonious
argument
as
to
the
further
operations
of
the
marshal
posse
we
losing
valuable
time
protested
harry
squires
at
the
end
of
a
fertile
discussion
is
here
employed
instead
of
for
never
was
there
a
more
extensive
crop
of
ideas
raised
by
human
agency
we
ca
do
anything
till
we
find

which
way
the
derned
rascals

cried
harry
we
got
to
split
up
into
parties
and
follow
every
road
out
of
tinkletown
how
in
thunder
do
you
expect
me
to
lead
five
or
six
different
posses
demanded
anderson
yes
an
what
in
thunder
would
we
do
if
we
caught
up
with
if
we
did
have
anderson
with
us
said
alf
reesling
loyal
to
the
core
in
the
first
place
we
would
have
any
legal
right
to
capture
and
in
the
second
place
we
could
do
it
anyhow
by
this
time
there
were
a
dozen
shotguns
on
the
scene
to
say
nothing
of
a
most
impressive
collection
of
antiquated
revolvers
flobert
rifles
civil
war
muskets
and
baseball
bats
i
move
we
move
was
the
laconic
but
excellent
speech
of
henry
plumb
he
already
had
his
forefinger
on
the
trigger
of
his
second
the
motion
cried
out
ed
higgins
loudly
i
thought
i
told
you
to
go
an
to
that
fire
ed
higgins
said
anderson
in
some
surprise
an
extremely
noisy
put
an
end
to
the
discussion
for
the
time
being
and
it
was
too
late
to
renew
it
after
situate
jones
mongrel
pete
had
finished
with
otto
schultz
dachshund
bismarck
so
vociferous
was
the
chorus
put
up
by
the
other
dogs
that
no
one
noticed
the
approach
of
an
automobile
coming
down
the
boggs
city
pike
the
car
passed
at
full
speed
three
dogs
failed
to
get
out
of
the
way
in
time
and
as
a
result
the
list
of
casualties
was
increased
to
four
including
ed
previously
mentioned
black
and
tan
the
speeding
car
a
big
one
loaded
with
men
was
a
hundred
yards
away
and
going
like
the
wind
before
the
startled
group
regained
its
senses
there
they
go
yelled
harry
squires
exceedin
the
speed
limit
roared
anderson
they
ought
to
be
locked
up
fer
ten
days
an
fined
come
on
men
shouted
harry
after
that
the
gang
they
been
headed
off
at
boggs
city
or
something
like
that
did
anybody
ketch
the
number
of
that
car
shouted
anderson
i
trace
by
their
license
number
if
the
rest
of
the
speech
was
lost
in
the
rush
to
enter
the
waiting
automobiles
and
the
shouting
that
ensued
then
followed
a
period
of
frantic
cranking
after
which
came
the
hasty
backing
and
turning
of
cars
the
tooting
of
horns
and
the
panic
of
gears
loaded
to
the
gunnels
the
machines
finally
got
under
way
and
off
they
went
into
the
night
chortling
with
an
excitement
all
their
own
a
lone
figure
remained
standing
in
front
of
anderson
crow
gate
a
tall
lank
figure
without
coat
or
hat
one
suspender
supporting
a
pair
of
blue
trousers
the
other
hanging
limp
and
useless
he
wore
a
red
undershirt
and
carried
in
his
left
hand
the
trumpet
of
a
chieftain
well
i
be
issued
from
his
lips
as
the
last
of
the
cars
rattled
away
then
he
started
off
bravely
on
foot
in
the
wake
of
the
noisy
cavalcade
now
all
of
are
breakin
the
speed
laws
an
goin
to
cost
somethin
consarn
when
i
yank
up
justice
robb
tomorrow
sure
as
my
name
anderson
crow
presently
he
heard
a
car
approaching
from
behind
it
was
very
dark
in
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
the
lonely
highway
that
reached
down
into
the
valley
was
a
thing
of
the
imagination
rather
than
of
the
vision
profiting
by
the
catastrophes
that
attended
the
passing
of
the
big
anderson
hastily
leaped
to
the
side
of
the
road
a
couple
of
small
headlights
veered
around
a
curve
in
the
road
and
came
down
the
slight
grade
followed
naturally
and
somewhat
haltingly
by
an
automobile
whose
timorous
brakes
were
half
set
there
was
a
single
occupant
anderson
levelled
his
trumpet
at
the
driver
and
shouted
halt
came
in
a
shrill
agitated
voice
from
the
car
but
the
machine
gave
no
sign
of
halting
hey

say

do

grade
anderson
was
trotting
along
behind
tugging
at
one
of
the
how
do
you
shut
it
off
the
same
way
you
turned
it
on
goodness
what
a
fool
way
to
do
things
the
little
car
came
to
a
stop
on
the
rise
of
the
grade
and
anderson
just
in
time
to
avoid
being
bumped
into
as
it
started
back
again
released
it
deacon
rank

explained
crow
in
response
to

o

all

ai
i
the
marshal
of

she
broke
in
crossly
what

all
you

without
me
in
this
the
only
official
thing

town

so
anderson
got
up
beside
her
and
pulled
desperately
at
his
no
doubt
to
assist
the
words
that
were
struggling
to
escape
from
his
compressed
lips
after
considerable
the
decrepit
machine
began
to
climb
the
grade
presently
crow
found
his
voice
did
i
tell
you
to

an
you

anderson

silent
for
a
moment
well
if
i
may
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
madam
where

he
asked
with
deep
sarcasm
in
his
voice
you
leave
it
to
me
anderson
crow
i
know
what
i
am
doing
they
went
on
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
she
spoke
again
there
only
one
way
to
turn
around
and
i
taking
it
how

she
said
firmly
there
was
another
long
intense
silence
i
wonder
if
the
boys

got
that
fire
out
yet
mumbled
anderson
course
there

over
spilt
milk
in
due
time
they
came
to
fisher
lane
crow
made
a
very
sharp
but
triumphant
turn
and
the
second
leg
of
the
course
was
before
them
half
an
hour
later
the
valiant
machine
sneaked
out
of
the
narrow
byway
into
the
britton
pike
and
pointed
its
nose
homeward
let
her
out
a
little
eva
said
anderson
taking
a
long
breath
four
mile
to
town
an
oh

squeaked
the
driver
giving
the
wheel
a
perilous
twist
look
there
comes
a
car
behind
us
help
they
run
into
us
they
pull
off
to
the
side
of
the
road
no

side
gosh
hurry

eva
they
comin
like
greased
lightnin
look
out
not
too
fer
over
there
a
ditch
alongside
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
was
lost
in
the
wild
shriek
of
a
siren
shriek
after
shriek
succeeding
each
other
as
a
big
car
with
acetylene
lamps
roared
down
upon
them
like
a
mighty
whirlwind
it
swept
by
them
careening
perilously
on
the
sloping
edge
of
the
road
suddenly
the
grinding
of
brakes
assailed
the
ears
of
the
thanksgiving
crows
and
to
their
astonishment
the
big
machine
came
to
a
standstill
a
hundred
yards
or
more
down
the
road
crow
promptly
put
on
the
accelerator
and
but
for
a
vehement
warning
from
her
husband
would
have
gone
full
tilt
into
the
rear
end
of
the
mighty
stranger
she
managed
to
stop
the
little
car
when
its
faithful
nose
was
not
more
than
two
yards
from
the
little
red
light
ahead
hey
ford
called
out
a
man
who
had
arisen
in
the
tonneau
of
the
big
car
and
was
looking
back
at
them

three
or
four
voices
in
the
car
were
guilty
of
saying
things
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
well
where

demanded
the
spokesman

and
the
big

forward

began
anderson
wrathfully

anderson
you
let

alone
the
little
old
car
was
sailing
along
at
a
speed
that
caused
every
joint
to
rattle
with
joy
unconfined
to
anderson
amazement
and
to
a
certain
extent
consternation
crow
swung
into
the
over
which
the
big
car
was
now
whizzing
a
mile
or
so
ahead
here
where
you
going
barked
anderson
arising
from
the
seat
there
going
to
be
hell
to
pay
before
you
know
it
anderson
crow
said
she
her
voice
high
and
squeaky
was
that
you
said
gasped
her
husband
flopping
back
in
the
seat
he
could
believe
his
ears
illustration
wha

you
said
gasped
her
husband
flopping
back
in
the
i
learned
that
from
my
predecessor

somewhat
guiltily

a
million
times
but
i
ai
no
woman
i
set
still
do
you
want
to
fall
out
and
break
your
neck
and
anderson
sat
still
dazed
and
helpless
in
the
direful
presence
of
a
woman
who
to
his
utter
horror
had
gone
violently
insane
he
began
silently
but
urgently
to
pray
that
the
gasoline
would
give
out
when
he
would
find
himself
in
a
position
to
reason
with
her
gently
or
forcibly
as
the
situation
demanded
he
broke
into
a
profuse
and
chilly
perspiration
his
wife
crazy
his
wife
of
forty
years
his
old
comrade
he
was
aroused
from
these
horrifying
sickening
reflections
by
a
hoarse
but
imperative
word
coming
from
nowhere
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
road
ahead
halt
crow
put
on
the
brakes
who
goes
there
friends
faltered
crow
the
marshal
of
tinkletown
added
anderson
vastly
relieved
by
her
singularly
intelligent
answer
advance
and
give
the
countersign
all
right
what
is
it
inquired
crow
a
couple
of
officers
joined
the
sentry
at
this
moment
they
were
but
half
dressed
what
the
devil
the
meaning
of
all
this
exclaimed
one
of
them
planting
himself
beside
the
car
and
flashing
a
light
in
face
do
you
hayseeds
know
any
better
than
to
bust
into
a
military
camp
his
companion
interrupted
him

about
a
mile
above
here
and

mrs

side
of

a
little
distance
away

company
of
soldiers

lining

sharp
command
of
an
officer
rang
out
thank

cried
crow

said
anderson
nervously

said
the
top
sergeant
they
stop

let
me
whisper
something
to
you
mr
officer
said
crow
very
important
he
obligingly
held
up
an
ear
and
she
leaned
down
and
spoke
rapidly
earnestly
into
it
you
do
say
so
he
cried
out
excuse
and
off
he
dashed
calling
out
to
his
companion
to
follow
a
minute
later
the
most
extraordinary
activity
affected
the
group
of
soldiers
over
the
way
commands
were
now
issued
in
lowered
tones
and
men
marched
rapidly
away
dividing
into
squads
what
did
you
say
to
that
feller
demanded
anderson
i
told
him
who
those
men
are
anderson

up
if

it
is
worth
more
than
ten
dollars
while
a
men
were
dragging
the
car
into
position
as
a
barricade
crow
exclaimed
to
her
husband
that
old
skinflint
he
said
it
was
cheap
at
fifty
dollars
thank
goodness
i
but
anderson
was
hustling
her
out
of
the
car
in
the
distance
the
headlights
of
the
bandits
car
burst
into
view
as
it
swung
around
a
bend
in
the
road
soldiers
everywhere
they
seemed
to
have
sprung
out
of
the
ground
on
came
the
big
car
thundering
into
the
trap
sounded
a
couple
of
guns
blazed
into
the
air
as
the
car
flew
past
the
outposts
lights
flared
suddenly
in
the
path
of
bewildered
occupants
and
loud
imperative
commands
rang
out
on
the
air
into
the
gantlet
of
guns
the
big
car
rushed
the
man
at
the
wheel
bent
low
and
took
the
reckless
chance
of
getting
through
then
a
hundred
feet
ahead
his
lights
fell
upon
the
dauntless
abandoned
flivver
he
jerked
frantically
at

they
halted

glorious
spectacular
death
harry
squires
in
his
account
placed

all
alone
in
the
list
of
unidentified
dead
three
minutes
after
the
collision
brawny
soldiers
were
bending
over
the
figures
of
five
unconscious
men
and
crow
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
group
and
silent
they
coming
around
all
right
said
some
one
at
anderson
elbow
he
was
slowing
down
when
they
struck
but
there
no
hope
for
the
poor
old
flivver
anderson
found
his
voice
a
quavering
uncertain
voice
and
exclaimed

action
on
the
part
of
the
civic
authorities

very
much
alive
and

pompous
harangue

anderson
crow
sat
on
the
porch
of
the
ruminating
over
the
epidemic
that
had
assailed
tinkletown
with
singular
virulence
and
in
a
sense
enthusiasm
not
that
there
was
anything
sinister
or
loathsome
about
the
plague
far
from
it
he
reflected
because
it
had
broken
out
so
soon
after
his
bitter
comments
on
the
prolonged
absence
of
the
slightest
symptom
or
indication
that
a
case
was
even
remotely
probable
and
here
he
was
holding
in
his
hand
four
fresh
and
unmistakable
signs
that
the
contagion
was
spreading
in
short
he
had
just
received
and
opened
four
envelopes
addressed
to
and
a
crow
and
each
contained
an
invitation
to
a
wedding

commonly
known
as
the

on
the
top
step

constable
he
inquired
i
do
know
much
about

crow
gingerly
pulling
at
his
whiskers
so
fer
as
i
know
it
ai
been
violated
up
here
what
the
harm
anyway

said
anderson
the
driver
the
same
said
the
marshal
his
lips
tightening
he
had
once
tried
to
arrest
the
young
man
for
disturbing
the
peace
and
had
been
obliged
to
call
upon
the
crowd

and
he

patiently
he

a
good
deal
of
ignorance
on
the
part
of
alf
during
a
long
and
watchful
acquaintanceship
anyhow
said
the
town
drunkard
arising
in
some
haste

gittin
home

i
ai
too
late

considerable
celerity
too
late

an
oh

exclaimed
alf
hotly
anderson
inspected
him
closely
lem
me
smell
your
breath
alf
reesling
he
commanded
what
the
use
growled
alf
would
last
fer
years
would
it
well
you
talk
mighty
queer
said
the
marshal
unconvinced
he
could
imagine
such
a
thing
as
a
strictly
sober
man
telling
him
to
go
to
grass
he
was
the
most
important
man
in
tinkletown
further
discussion
was
prevented
by
the
approach
of
crow
daughter
susie
accompanied
by
a
tall
young
man
in
a
resplendent
checked
suit
and
a
dazzling
red
necktie
they
came
from
popular
drugstore
and
parlour
two
doors
below
hello
pop
said
susie
gaily
as
the
couple
sauntered
past
their
seniors
you
mr
crow
was
the
young
man
greeting
uttered
with
the
convulsive
earnestness
of
sudden
embarrassment
fine
day
ai
it
crow
said
that
it
was
and
then
both
he
and
alf
stopped
short
in
their
tracks
and
gazed
intently
at
the
backs
of
the
young
people
even
as
they
stared
a
fiery
redness
enveloped
the
ears
of
susie
companion
a
few
steps
farther
on
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
back
something
that
may
be
described
as
sheepish
defiance
marked
that
swift
involuntary
glance
reesling
broke
the
silence
there
was
a
worried
sympathetic
note
in
his
voice
got
on
his
sunday
clothes
anderson
and
this
is
only
wednesday
beats
the
dutch
do
it
i
wonder
began
crow
and
then
closed
his
lips
so
tightly
and
so
abruptly
that
his
sparse
chin
whiskers
stuck
out
almost
horizontally
he
started
off
briskly
in
the
wake
of
the
young
people
alf
forgetting
his
own
apprehensions
in
the
face
of
this
visible
manifestation
shuffled
along
a
few
paces
behind
miss
crow
and
her
companion
turned
the
corner
below
and
were
lost
to
view
by
gosh
said
alf
suddenly
increasing
his
speed
until
he
came
abreast
of
the
other
you
better
hurry
anderson
justice
robb
in
his
office
i
seen
his
feet
in
the
winder
a
little
while
ago
they
surely
ca
be
thinkin
of
crow
did
not
complete
the
sentence
why
not
demanded
alf
everybody
else
is
and
it
would
be
just
like
that
schultz
boy
to
do
it
without
an
invitation
ever
since
this
been
goin
on
them
schultzes
have
been
blowin
about
always
prepared
fer
anything

efficiency
what
they
always
up
to
people
i
bet
he
been
over
to
the
county
seat
an
got
a
license
to
anderson
interrupted
him
with
a
snort
he
put
his
hand
on
his
right
hip
pocket
where
something
bulged
ominously
and
quickened
his
pace
i
been
watchin
these
schultzes
fer
nearly
a
year
said
he
an
the
whole
caboodle
of
are
spies
they
turned
the
corner
susie
and
her
companion
were
on
the
point
of
disappearing
in
a
doorway
fifty
yards
down
sickle
street
anderson
slowed
up
he
removed
his
broad
felt
hat
with
the
gold
cord
around
it
and
mopped
his
forehead
that
the
gallery
he
said
a
little
out
of
breath
worse
an
more
of
it
said
alf
that
the
surest
sign
i
know
of
it
never
fails
mollie
an
me
had
taken
the
day
before
we
was
married
an
an
why
it
almost
the
same
as
a
certificat
anderson
now
you

on
alf
commanded
the
marshal
how
many
times
i
got
to
tell
you
not
to
loiter
aroun
the
streets
move
on
i
say
aw
now
anderson
i
have

an
that

up
on

telephone
pole
over
there

loiterin
if
you
need
any
evidence
that
schultz
boy

said
alf
generously
i
seen
him
commit
an
atrocity
last
week
what
was
it
he
give
that
little
griggs
girl
a
lift
in
his
butcher
wagon
said
alf
darkly
anderson
scowled
the
sooner
we
run
these
cussed
germans
out
o
town
the
better
off
we
be
alf
ambled
off
casting
many
glances
over
his
shoulder
and
the
marshal
crossed
the
street
and
entered
hawkins
undertaking
and
embalming
establishment
from
a
window
of
which
he
had
a
fair
view
of
the
studio
presently
susie
and
young
schultz
emerged
giggling
and
snickering
over
the
pink
objects
they
held
in
their
hands
they
sauntered
slowly
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
the
direction
of
main
street
hawkins
was
in
the
middle
of
one
of
his
funniest
stories
when
anderson
got
up
and
walked
out
hurriedly
the
undertaker
had
a
reputation
as
a
wit
he
was
the
life
of
the
community
he
radiated
optimism
even
when
most
depressingly
employed
and
here
he
was
telling
anderson
crow
a
story
he
had
heard
at
a
funeral
over
in
kirkville
when
up
jumps
his
listener
and
lights
out
without
so
much
as
a
word
hawkins
went
to
the
door
and
looked
out
expecting
to
see
a
fight
or
a
runaway
horse
or
a
german
airplane
all
he
saw
was
the
marshal
not
two
doors
away
peering
intently
into
a
while
from
across
the
street
two
young
people
regarded
him
with
visible
amusement
for
a
long
time
thereafter
the
undertaker
sat
in
his
office
and
stared
moodily
at
the
row
of
caskets
lining
the
opposite
wall
could
it
be
possible
that
he
was
losing
his
grip
miss
crow
and
otto
schultz
resumed
their
stroll
after
a
few
moments
and
the
marshal
following
their
movements
in
the
reflecting
waited
until
they
were
safely
around
the
corner
then
he
retraced
his
steps
quickly
passed
the
undertaker
place
and
turned
into
the
alley
beyond
three
minutes
later
he
entered
main
street
a
block
above
sickle
street
and
was
leaning
carelessly
against
the
indian
tobacco
sign
in
front
of
jackson
cigar
store
when
his
daughter
and
her
companion
bore
down
upon
his
left
flank
alf
reesling
was
a
few
paces
behind
them
as
they
came
within
earshot
young
schultz
was
saying
in
a
suspiciously
earnest
manner
you
better
come
in
and
have
anodder
sody
susie
just
then
their
gaze
fell
upon
crow
goodness
exclaimed
susie
startled
by
cheminy
fell
from
otto
mouth
he
blinked
a
couple
of
times
is
is
that
you
he
inquired
incredulously
you
mean
asked
anderson
with
considerable
asperity
sure
said
otto
halting
ca
you
see
it
me
demanded
crow
but
you
ain
here
said
the
perplexed
young
man
getting
pinker
all
the
time
you
aroundt
in
sickle
street
alf
called
out
anderson
look
here
a
minute
is
this
me
he
spoke
with
biting
sarcasm
reesling
regarded
him
with
some
anxiety
you
better
go
home
anderson
he
said
this
sun
is
a
derned
sight
you
think
did
we
see
you
a
minute
ago
around
in
sickle
street
pop
inquired
susie
looking
in
that
window
maybe
you
did
and
maybe
you
did
replied
crow
shrewdly
then
with
thinly
veiled
significance
i
purty
busy
lookin
into
a
good
many
things
nowadays
he
favoured
otto
with
a
penetrating
glance
ever
sence
the
declared
war
on
germany
otto
schultz
how
aboudt
that
sody
miss
susie
said
otto
in
a
pained
sort
of
voice
you
better
be
saving
your
money
otto
she
advised
with
such
firmness
that
her
father
looked
at
her
sharply
oh
spiffles
said
otto
getting
still
redder
crow
was
all
ears
alf
reesling
burned
his
fingers
on
a
match
he
held
too
long
in
the
hot
still
air
some
six
or
eight
inches
from
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
well
getting
married
is
no
joke
said
susie
shaking
her
pretty
head
solemnly
otto
took
a
deep
breath
you
bet
you
it
ain
he
said
with
feeling
that
seemed
to
give
him
courage
he
took
off
his
straw
hat
and
as
he
ran
his
finger
around
the
moist
he
blurted
out
i
mind
if
you
tell
your
fadder
susie
go
and
tell
him
tell
him
yourself
said
susie
as
i
was
saying
a
few
minutes
ago
said
otto
ingenuously
the
only
obchection
i
had
to
your
tellin
your
fadder
was
that
i
did
want
everybody
in
town
to
know
it
before
i
could
get
home
and
tell
my
mother
yet
do
go
away
alf
said
crow
darkly
i
need
you
as
a
witness
i
hereby
subpoena
you
as
a
witness
to
what
goin
to
happen
in
no
time
now
otto
schultz
spit
it
out
otto
disgorged
these
cyclonic
words
i
going
to

all

and

turned
upon

purty
derned
quick
said
anderson
and
pointed
his
long
trembling
forefinger
at
the
amazed
schultz
who
had
dropped
his
hat
and
was
stooping
over
to
retrieve
it
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
menacing
face
of
the
speaker
it
had
rolled
in
the
direction
of
alf
reesling
that
gentleman
obligingly
stopped
it
with
his
foot
after
removing
his
foot
he
undertook
to
return
the
hat
without
stooping
at
all
the
result
being
that
it
sped
past
otto
and
landed
in
the
middle
of
the
street
some
twenty
feet
away
so

think

run

in
fer

peace
young
feller
warned
anderson
observing
that
a
few
of
citizens
were
slowly
but
surely
surrendering
squatter
rights
to
chairs
and
on
the
shady
side
of
the
block
just
you

a
civil
tongue
in
you

answered
my
question
yet
insisted
otto
with
increased
vigour
here
your

said
alf
reesling
in
a
conciliatory
voice
he
was
brushing
the
article
with
the
sleeve
of
his
coat

horse

on
it
or
somethin
i
never

i
of

bellowed
otto

vote

at
the
last
that
ai
the
question
interrupted
anderson
sharply
the
question
is

the
girl
of
age
he
favoured
his
daughter
with
a
fiery
glance
otto
schultz
broad
flat
face
became
strangely
pinched
there
was
something
positively
apoplectic
in
the
hue
that
spread
over
it
oh
pop
shrieked
susie
a
peal
of
laughter
bursting
from
her
lips
instantly
however
her
two
hands
were
pressed
to
her
mouth
stifling
the
outburst
otto
gave
her
a
hurt
surprised
and
unmistakably
horrified
look
then
a
silly
grin
struggled
into
existence
maybe
she
don
tell
the
truth
aboud
her
age
yet
crow
he
said
huskily
women
always
lie
aboud
their
ages
maybe
she
lie
aboud
hers
anderson
flared
do
you
dare
say
my
daughter
lies
about
her
age
or
anything
else
he
roared
whose
daughter
gasped
otto
mine
but
she
ain
your
daughter
well
of
all
the
words
failed
crow
he
looked
helplessly
appealingly
at
alf
reesling
as
if
for
support
illustration
failed
reesling
rose
to
the
occasion
do
you
mean
to
insinuate
otto
schultz
that
he
began
as
he
started
to
remove
his
coat
by
this
time
susie
felt
it
was
safe
to
trust
herself
to
speech
she
removed
her
hands
from
her
mouth
and
cried
out
he
is
talking
about
me
pop
she
gasped
it

bumbelburg

said
otto
hastily
crow
still
being
speechless
alf
suspended
his
belligerent
preparations
and
cocking
one
eye
calculatingly
settled
the
matter
of
miss
bumbelburg
age
with
exasperating
accuracy
gertie
a
little
past
he
announced
born
in
march
just
back
o
where

used
to
be
the
marshal

his
composure
that
sufficient
he
said
accepting
alf

testimony
with
a
profound
air
of
dignity
there

otto
uncomfortably
then
he
added
with
considerable
acerbity

you

and
more
rambunctious
every

alf
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of

speakin
by
a

when

a
condition
said
otto
turning
from
the
unfortunate
alf
to
miss

that
so

crow
quickly

said
otto
triumphantly
i
can
say
it
as
good
as

yet
anderson
nudged
reesling
and
chuckled
that
the
way
to
spot
he
said
significantly
there
a
better
way
than
that
said
alf
how
that
alf
whispered
in
the
marshal
ear
anderson
shook
his
head
but
where
are
you
goin
to
get
the
weenywurst
alf
come
on
otto
said
susie
impatiently
i
have
an
engagement
they
moved
off
rapidly
passing
the
parlour
without
hesitating

that
said
alf
after
a
moment
she
said
she
was
engaged
that
night
anderson
crow
town

superintendent
of

of

of
the
truant
officer
member
of
the
american
detective
association
member
of
the
universal
detective
bureau
chairman
of
tinkletown
battlefield
society
lay
awake
until
nearly
nine
seeking
a
solution
to
the
astonishing
problem
that
confronted
tinkletown
and
its
environs
late
reports
received
by
telephone
just
before
retiring
ran
the
number
of
prospective
marriages
up
to
his
daughters
susie
and
caroline
the
latter
the
eldest
of
a
family
of
six
and
secretly
approaching
the
age
of
confided
to
him
that
they
had
had
eleven
and
three
proposals
respectively
a
singular
feature
of
the
craze
was
the
unanimity
of
impulse
affecting
men
between
the
ages
of
twenty
and
thirty
and
the
utter
absence
of
concentration
on
the
part
of
the
applicants
it
was
of
record
that
some
of
them
proposed
to
as
many
as
five
or
six
young
women
before
being
finally
accepted
rashness
appeared
to
be
the
watchword
the
matrimonial
stampede
swept
caution
and
consequences
into
a
general
heap
and
delivered
a
community
of
the
backwardness
that
threatened
to
become
a
menace
to
posterity
as
anderson
crow
lay
in
his
bed
he
tried
to
enumerate
on
his
fingers
the
young
men
who
remained
unpledged
starting
with
his
thumb
he
got
as
far
as
the
third
finger
of
his
left
hand
and
then
being
sleepy
and
the
effort
a
trying
one
he
lost
track
of
those
already
counted
and
had
to
begin
all
over
again
with
the
maddening
result
that
he
could
go
no
further
than
the
second
finger
one
of
the
eligibles
had
slipped
his
mind
completely
the
whole
situation
was
harrowing
fer
instance
he
ruminated
aloud
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
his
wife
was
sound
asleep
what
is
a
feller
like
newt
blossom
goin
to
keep
a
wife
on
i
like
to
know
he
hardly
keep
himself
in
tobaccer
as
it
is
an
as
fer
the
other
necessities
of
life
he
have
any
of
if
his
mother
was
such
a
dern
fool
about
him
the
idee
of
him
tryin
to
get
our
susie
to
marry
him
an
carrie
too
fer
that
matter
i
git
in
a
cold
sweat
every
time
i
think
of
it
he
shook
his
wife
vigorously
say
ma
he
said
yawning
i
just
thought
o
somethin
i
want
you
to
remember
in
the
mornin
wake
up
all
right
she
mumbled
sleepily
what
is
it
but
crow
was
now
fast
asleep
himself
early
the
next
morning
he
entered
the
kitchen
where
he
found
caroline
helping
her
mother
with
the
breakfast
crow
paused
in
the
act
of
paring
slices
from
a
side
of
bacon
she
eyed
her
husband
inimically
see
here
anderson
you
just
got
to
put
a
stop
to
all
this
foolishness
do
bother
me
ca
you
see
i
thinkin
said
he
well
it
time
you
did
somethin
more
than

that
smathers
boy
was
here
about
ten
minutes
ago
red
as
a
beet
askin
fer
susie
carrie
told
him

anderson
blinked
and
shook
his
head
he
said
i
guess

mind
outside
fer
a
couple
of
minutes
i
got
somethin
i
want
to
say
to
you
in
private
caroline
sat
down
and
laughed
unrestrainedly
well
by
geminy
crickets
gasped
anderson
aghast
then
he
added
anxiously
you
you
did
go
an
do
anything
foolish
did
you
carrie
not
unless
you
call
throwing
a
pail
of
cold
water
on
him
foolish
said
carrie
wiping
her
eyes
somethin
got
to
be
done
anderson
said
his
wife
compressing
her
lips
susie
came
in
at
that
juncture
she
was
the
apple
of
anderson
eye
the
prettiest
girl
in
town
crow
hurried
to
the
kitchen
door
go
back
upstairs
he
ordered
casting
a
swift
uneasy
glance
around
the
back
yard
what
the
matter
pop
crow
did
not
respond
his
keen
roving
eye
had
descried
a
motionless
figure
at
the
mouth
of
the
alley
caroline
explained
can
you
beat
it
cried
susie
inelegantly
but
with
a
very
proper
scorn
i
told
him
yesterday
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
trying
to
coax
fanny
burns
away
from
ed
foster
ed
foster
exclaimed
crow
sharply
turning
from
the
doorway
why
he
not
goin
to
be
married
till
after
the
war
an
that
a
long
ways
off
ed
around
in
his
uniform
an
says
the
national
guard
likely
to
be
called
any
day
now
he
that
one
of
the
arguments
joe
smathers
put
up
to
fanny
said
his
youngest
daughter
he
said
maybe
the
war
would
last
five
years
and
he
thought
she
was
a
fool
to
wait
that
long
what
more
he
said
if
ed
ever
does
get
to
france
he
likely
to
be
killed
or
fatally
wounded
and
then
where
would
she
be
anderson
suddenly
lifted
his
right
leg
and
slapped
it
with
great
force
by
the
great
jehoshaphat
he
shouted
i
got
it
i
solved
the
whole
derned
mystery
come
to
me
like
a
flash
of
all
the
cowardly
crow
interrupted
him
do
you
mean
to
say
anderson
crow
that
you
never
suspected
what
got
into
all
these
gay
lotharios
he
was
instantly
on
his
guard
what
are
you
talkin
about
ma
he
demanded
querulously
you
surely
ca
mean
to
insinuate
that
i
what
is
this
mystery
you
just
been
solvin
she
asked
relentlessly
he
met
this
with
a
calm
intolerance
nothin
much
just
simply
got
to
the
bottom
of
a
german
plot
to
stuff
the
young
men
of
america
so
full
of
weddin
cake
they
wo
be
able
to
git
into
the
trenches
that
all
my
goodness
exclaimed
crow
who
as
a
dutiful
wife
never
failed
to
be
impressed
by
her
husband
belated
discoveries
eggin
our
boys
into
gittin
married
so
they
ca
be
drafted
went
on
anderson
expanding
with
his
idea
it
a
general
plot
as
the
sayin
is
now
i
tell
you
somethin
else
shut
the
door
susie
like
as
not
some
spy
outside
this
very
minute

onto
he
lowered
his
voice
you
be
surprised
if
i
was
to
tell
you
that
the
whole
derned
plot
originated
right
here
in
tinkletown
would
you
well
exactly
what
i
goin
to
tell
you
started
right
here
and
spread
from
one
end
of
the
land
to
the
other
sort
of
headquarters
here
i
know
as
there
is
any
more
prominent
or
influential
germans
in
the
whole
united
states
than
adolph
schultz
the
butcher
on
main
street
and
heiney
wimpelmeyer
the
tanyard
man
and
ben
olson
the
contractor
and
ben
olson

swede
interrupted
carrie
he
to
be
a
swede
said
her
father
severely
do
try
to
tell
me
anything
carrie
i
guess
i
know
what
i
talkin
about
he
paused
to
mentally
repair
the
break
in
his
chain
of
thought
um
ah
what
i
talkin
about
about
the
swedes
said
carrie
snickering
breakfast
ready
pa
said
crow
call
the
boys
susie
how
are
you
going
to
stop
it
pop
inquired
susie
after
they
were
all
seated
never

anderson
if
they
set
on
doin
it
said
his
wife
you
bet
if
i
was
old
enough
i
would
be
gittin
married
said
hiram
in
a
somewhat
ambiguous
burst
of
patriotism
immediately
after
breakfast
crow
set
out
for
the
town
hall
he
was
deep
in
thought
his
whiskers
were
elevated
to
an
almost
unprecedented
level
so
tightly
was
his
jaw
set
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
preserve
the
honour
of
tinkletown
meeting
alf
reesling
in
front
of
the
post
office
he
unburdened
himself
in
a
flood
of
indignation
that
left
the
town
drunkard
soberer
than
he
had
been
in
years
despite
his
vaunted
abstemiousness
but
you
ca
slap
all
the
germans
in
jail
anderson
protested
alf
in
the
first
place
it
ai
legal
and
in
the
second
place
in
the
second
place
he
paused
and
scratched
his
head
evidently
to
some
purpose
for
suddenly
his
face
cleared
in
the
second
place
the
jail
ai
big
enough
that
ai
my
fault
said
the
marshal
grimly
we
got
to
nip
this
thing
in
the
bud
if
we
have
to
what
proof
have
you
got
that
the
germans
are
back
of
all
this
got
to
have
proof
you
know
gosh
alf
ai
you
got
any
sense
at
all
what
are
all
these
fellers
gittin
married
for
if
there
ai
somethin
behind
it
they
ai
they
gittin
married
because
every
blamed
one
of
is
a
slacker
said
alf
forcibly
a
what
slacker
they
do
want
to
fight
that
what
it
means
anderson
pondered
he
tugged
at
his
whiskers
they
do
want
to
fight
he
demanded
abruptly
nobody
said
alf
they
do
want
to
fight
the
said
crow
triumphantly
that
ought
to
settle
the
matter
alf
what
better
proof
do
you
want
than
that
that
shows
the
germans
are
back
of
the
whole
infernal
plot
they
are
corruptin
our
young
men
eggin
into
gittin
married
so
well
said
alf
there
only
one
way
to
put
a
stop
to
that
you
got
to
appeal
to
the
women
and
girls
of
this
here
town
you
simply
got
to
talk
to
like
a
dutch
uncle
anderson
these
boys
of
have
just
got
to
remain
single
fer
the
duration
of
the
war
that
puts
an
idee
in
my
head
said
anderson
i
put
up
an
official
notice
from
that
all
marriages
contracted
before
the
draft
are
fer
the
duration
of
the
war
only
how
that
thunderation
no
that
just
what
the
boys
would
like
anything
but
it
ai
what
the
would
like
it
is
reesling
was
silent
for
a
long
time
letting
the
idea
crystallize
so
to
speak
supposin
they
hear
about
it
in
said
he
doubtfully
but
still
dazzled
by
the
thought
president
wilson
do
know
this
town
on
the
map
said
anderson
a
most
surprising
admission
for
him
an
even
if
he
does
hear
about
it
he
back
me
up
you
bet
your
boots
on
that
even
if
i
am
a
republican
come
on
alf
let
step
around
to
the
office
shortly
before
noon
a
hastily
printed
poster
still
damp
and
smelling
of
ink
appeared
on
the
in
front
of
the
town
hall
a
few
minutes
later
a
similar
decoration
marred
the
façade
of
the
fairbanks
scales
in
front
of
higgins
feed
store
and
still
another
loomed
up
on

they
were
lured
by

of

as

of

put
in
place
the
rev

my

he
to

this

true
does
seem
a
little

it
said
anderson
guiltily
can
it
be
possible
that
the

has
issued
such
a
revolutionary

minute

said
the
marshal
taking
him
by
the
arm
and
furtively
glancing
over
his
own
shoulder
it
ai
true
not
a

word
of
it
now
wait
a

off

joined

he
adjusted
his
spectacles
and
peered
at
the
notice
well
well
bless
my
soul
he
exclaimed
staring
blankly
at
the
congregationalist
what
all
this
i
see
come
inside
said
anderson
hastily
alf
if

go

and

anderson
inquired
the
compositor
shifting
his
quid
certainly
said
the
marshal
later
on
the
marshal
left
the
town
hall
followed
by
several
smiling
gentlemen
of
the
cloth
justice
robb
and
the
editor
of
the
bless
your

said

solid
behind

said
the
rev
maltby
still
a
bit
shaken
we
can
simply
say
that
the
matter
is
news
to
us
eh
brothers
sure
said
father
maloney
we
can
do
that
much
for
the
good
of
the
country
indeed
if
i
closely
pressed
i
may
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
official
despatch
from
washington
this
is
no
time
to
deny
the
president
gentlemen
no
matter
who
issues
his
proclamation
he
added
the
last
with
a
whimsical
smile
and
a
wink
that
rather
shocked
his
methodist
brother
especially
when
the
whole
matter
is
vouched
for
by
our
respected
town
marshal
who
to
my
certain
knowledge
possesses
the
veracity
of
a
george

you
ever
been
caught

cherry
tree

anderson
promptly
father

beamed
there

he
exclaimed
heartily
i
told
ye
so
the
epitome
of
veracity
there
is
another
man
of
his
age
in
america
who
would
have
answered
no
to
that
question
with
no
one
in
a
position
to
contradict
him
the
editor
had
his
notebook
gentlemen
would
you
object
to
being
interviewed
on
this
important
message
from
washington
giving
your
views
on
the
situation

and
expedient
said
rev
maltby
rising
nobly
to
the
occasion
father
maloney
and
rev
downs
promptly
acquiesced
and
also
that

certificates

long
before
nightfall
the
sleepy
village
of
tinkletown
was
in
a
state
of
agitation
unsurpassed
by
anything
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
along
about
supper
time
one
could
have
heard
animated
arguments
rising
above
the
clear
stillness
of
the
air
penetrating
even
to
the
heaven
which
was
called
upon
to
witness
the
unswerving
fidelity
of
two
opposing
sexes
there
was
a
distinct
difference
however
in
the
duration
of
this
professed
fidelity
masculine
voices
pleaded
for
the
immediate
justification
of
undying
constancy
while
those
of
a
feminine
quality
preferred
a
prolongation
of
the
exquisite
agony
of
suspense
in
short
the
were
obdurate
they
insisted
on
waiting
even
to
the
end
of
time
for
the
realization
of
their
fondest
dearest
hopes
several
heartbroken
gentlemen
preferring
anything
to
procrastination
threatened
to
shoot
themselves

heartbroken
gentlemen
threatened
to
shoot
what
the

of
doing
that
argued
one
widow
of
a
practical
turn
of

you
can
save
funeral
expenses
by
letting
the

do

for
you
the
next
day
the
merchants
of
tinkletown
notably
the
five
and
ten
cent
store
and
fisher
queensware
store
did
a
thriving
business
from
one
end
of
the
town
to
the
other
came
people
returning
presents
that
fortunately
had
not
been
delivered
and
others
asking
to
have
their
accounts
credited
with
presents
already
received
of
the
weddings
announced
for
the
week
ending
june
only
one
took
place
otto
schultz
was
married
on
saturday
to
miss
bumbelburg
he
was
the
only
candidate
in
town
who
was
worth
suing
for
breach
of
promise
miss
bumbelburg
having
waited
many
years
for
her
chance
was
not
to
be
frightened
by
a
presidential
proclamation
the
duration
of
the
war
meant
nothing
to
her
she
had
unlimited
faith
in
the
kaiser
when
the
war
was
over
he
would
come
over
to
the
united
states
and
revoke
all
the
silly
old
laws
and
she
was
so
positive
about
it
that
after
a
rather
heated
interview
in
the
home
of
schultz
senior
that
gentleman
admitted
it
would
be
cheaper
for
her
to
come
and
live
with
them
after
the
wedding
than
to
present
her
with
the
thousand
dollars
she
demanded
in
case
otto
preferred
war
to
peace
crow
on
the
of
june
strode
proudly
efficiently
up
and
down
main
street
always
stopping
at
the
registration
booth
to
slap
former
fiancés
on
the
back
and
encourage
them
with
such
remarks
as
this

right

with

better
would

the
perfect
end
of
a
day
anderson
crow
gets
one
on
the
kaiser
a
long
bank
of
almost
clouds
hung
over
a
horizon
the
sun
of
a
warm
drowsy
september
day
was
going
to
bed
beyond
the
scallop
of
hills
suddenly
the
red
in
the
sky
as
if
fanned
by
an
angry
wind
blazed
into
a
rigid
flame
catching
the
base
of
the
cloud
it
turned
its
edges
into
fire
and
as
the
flame
burnt
itself
out
the
rich
yellow
of
gold
came
to
glorify
the
triumphant
cloud
the
nether
edge
seemed
to
dip
into
a
lake
the
shores
of
which
were
molten
gold
and
upon
whose
surface
craft
of
colours
lay
moored
for
the
coming
night
anderson
crow
marshal
of
tinkletown
leaned
upon
his
fence
and
listened
to
the
rhapsodic
comments
of
miss
sue
becker
on
the
passing
panorama
miss
becker
who
had
contributed
several
poems
to
the
columns
of
the
tinkletown
and
more
than
once
had
exhibited
encouraging
letters
from
the
editors
of
and
other
magazines
was
always
worth
listening
to
for
as
every
one
knows
she
was
the
first
and
so
far
as
revealed
the
only
literary
genius
ever
created
within
the
precincts
of
tinkletown
you
have
to
write
a
piece
about
it
sue
said
anderson
shifting
his
spare
frame
slightly
no
mortal
pen
crow
could
do
justice
to
the
grandeur
the
overpowering
splendour
of
that
vista
said
she
anderson
took
another
look
at
the
sunset
a
more
or
less
stealthy
one
it
must
be
confessed
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
sunsets
were
not
much
in
his
line
it
a
great
vister
he
acknowledged
i
do
know
as
i
can
think
of
a
word
that
will
rhyme
with
it
though
there
is
such
a
thing
as
blank
verse
crow
said
miss
becker
smiling
in
a
most
superior
way
crow
was
thinking
blister
would
be
bad
he
announced
something
about
the
vister
causin
a
blister
i
do
know
as
you
are
aware
of
the
fact
sue
but
i
wrote
poetry
when
i
was
a
young
feller
crow
got
all
tied
up
in
a
pink
ribbon
it
a
mighty
funny
thing
that
she
wo
even
show
to
anybody
oh
but
they
are
sacred
said
miss
becker
feelingly
as
she
looked
over
the
rims
of
her
spectacles
at
a
spot
in
the
sky
some
degrees
above
the
steeple
of
the
congregational
church
down
the
street
i
do
know
as
i
meant
to
be
sacred
at
the
time
said
he
but
there
was
anything
in
that
was
unfittin
for
a
young
lady
to
read
you
do
understand
what
could
be
more
sacred
than
the
outpourings
of
love
what
more
it
was
a
good
many
years
ago
crow
was
quick
to
explain
love
young
dream
chided
miss
becker
coyly
crow
twisted
his
sparse
grey
beard
with
unusual
tenderness
beats
all
do
it
sue
what
a
poet
do
when
he
tryin
to
raise
a
moustache
i
am
sure
i
do
know
said
miss
becker
stiffly
speakin
about
sunsets
said
he
hastily
after
a
quick
glance
at
her
shaded
upper
lip
how
your
pa
i
heard
he
had
a
sinkin
spell
yestiday
he
better
a
moment
later
with
fine
scorn
his
sun
has
set
yet
mr
crow
beats
all
how
he
hangs
on
do
it
last
birthday
spry
as
a
man
o
fifty
up
to
he
broke
off
to
devote
his
attention
to
a
couple
of
strangers
farther
down
the
street
two
men
who
approached
slowly
on
the
plank
sidewalk
pausing
every
now
and
then
to
peer
inquiringly
at
the
front
doors
of
houses
along
the
way
miss
sue
becker
whose
back
was
toward
the
strangers
allowed
her
poetic
mind
to
resume
its
interest
in
the
sunset
golden
cloudlets
float
upon
a
coral
what
did
you
say
mr
crow
ever
see
before
sue
hundreds
of
times
they
remind
me
of
the
daintiest
fleeciest
puffs
of
i
talkin
about
those
men
comin
up
the
street
said
the
old
town
marshal
sharply
miss
becker
abandoned
the
transient
sunset
for
something
more
durable
summers
had
passed
over
her
head
for
one
professedly
indifferent
to
the
opposite
sex
miss
becker
went
far
toward
dislocating
her
neck
when
anderson
crow
mentioned
the
approach
of
a
couple
of
strange
men
i
never
seen
either
of
them
before
crow
she
said
a
little
jump
in
her
voice
that
settles
it
said
anderson
putting
on
his
spectacles
settles
what
proves
they
ai
been
in
tinkletown
twenty
minutes
he
replied
much
too
promptly
to
suit
miss
becker
who
favoured
him
with
a
look
he
would
have
forgotten
in
a
long
time
if
he
had
had
eyes
in
the
back
of
his
head
they
must
be
lookin
for
some
one
he
went
on
squinting
narrowly
sue
see
you
tomorrer
i
suppose
i
not
going
yet
crow
she
said
moving
a
little
closer
to
the
fence
you
do
suppose
i
going
to
let
those
men
pursue
me
all
the
way
home
do
you
they
do
look
like
kidnappers
he
said
besides
it
ai
dark
enough
yet
just
what
do
you
mean
by
that
anderson
crow
she
snapped
what
do
i
mean
by
what
he
inquired
in
some
surprise
by
what
you
just
said
i
mean
you
perfectly
safe
as
long
as
it
daylight
he
retorted
what
else
could
i
mean
the
two
strangers
were
quite
near
by
this
time
near
enough
in
fact
to
cause
miss
becker
to
lower
her
voice
as
she
said
they
awfully
nice
looking
gentlemen
ai
they
evidently
crow
explanation
had
satisfied
her
for
she
was
smiling
with
considerable
vivacity
as
she
made
the
remark
up
to
that
instant
she
had
neglected
her
back
hair
now
she
gracefully
lingeringly
fingered
it
to
see
if
it
was
properly
in
place
in
doing
so
she
managed
to
drop
her
parasol
to
her
chagrin
marshal
crow
took
that
occasion
to
behave
in
a
most
incredible
manner
it
is
quite
probable
that
he
forgot
himself
in
any
case
he
picked
up
the
parasol
and
returned
it
to
her
snatching
it
in
fact
almost
from
beneath
the
foot
of
the
nearest
stranger
oh
thank
you
thank
you
kindly
crow
she
giggled
and
proceeded
to
let
it
slip
out
of
her
fingers
again
oh
how
stupid
how
perfectly
clumsy
did
i
hear
you
addressed
as
mr
crow
inquired
the
foremost
of
the
two
strangers
halting
abruptly
he
was
a
tall
florid
man
of
forty
or
thereabouts
with
a
deep
and
not
unpleasant
voice
his
companion
was
also
tall
but
very
gaunt
and
sallow
he
wore
huge
round
spectacles
hooked
over
his
ears
both
were
well
dressed
one
in
grey
flannel
the
other
in
blue
serge
you
did
said
the
town
marshal
straightening
up
you
dropped
your
umbrell
sue
he
added
yes
sir
my
name
crow
miss
becker
waited
a
few
seconds
and
then
picked
up
the
parasol
the
celebrated
anderson
crow
asked
the
man
with
the
glasses
opening
his
eyes
a
little
wider
illustration
the
celebrated
anderson
crow
asked
the
man
with
the
crow
suddenly
remembered
that
he
was
in
his
his
faded
blue
undress
he
called
it
hung
limp
and
neglected
on
the
more
or
less
he
admitted
wishing
to
goodness
he
had
on
his
best
pair
of
galluses
instead
of
the
ones
he
was
wearing
marshal
of
tinkletown
i
believe
said
the
florid
stranger
raising
his
eyebrows
slightly
excuse
me
said
anderson
conscious
of
a
certain
disparaging
note
in
the
speaker
voice
which
he
quite
naturally
laid
to
the
galluses
without
turning
his
back
toward
them
he
retrieved
his
coat
from
the
remembering
in
time
that
those
plaguey
suspenders
had
played
him
false
that
day
and
alf
reesling
had
volunteered
to
tie
a
knot
in
somewhere
in
the
back
i
could
fine
myself
five
dollars
fer
goin
without
my
uniform
said
he
as
he
slipped
an
arm
into
one
sleeve
it
one
of
my
rules
and
his
other
arm
went
in
not
without
a
slight
twinge
for
he
had
been
experiencing
a
touch
of
rheumatism
in
that
shoulder
yes
sir
i
the
marshal
o
tinkletown
he
added
indicating
the
bright
nickel
star
that
gleamed
resplendent
among
an
assortment
of
glittering
and
impressive
dangling
emblems
the
man
with
the
spectacles
peered
intently
at
the
collection
on
crow
breast
you
appear
to
be
almost
everything
else
as
well
crow
said
he
respectfully
well
i
guess
i
have
to
be
going
put
in
miss
becker
at
this
juncture
give
my
love
to
the
girls
mr
crow
she
moved
off
up
the
her
back
as
stiff
as
a
ramrod
any
one
with
half
an
eye
could
see
that
she
was
resolved
not
to
drop
the
parasol
again
no
savage
warrior
on
battle
bent
ever
gripped
his
club
with
greater
determination
so
long
was
all
that
marshal
crow
could
spare
the
time
to
say
yes
sir
he
went
on
making
a
fine
show
of
stifling
a
yawn
yes
sir
had
a
few
triflin
honours
in
my
day
you
gentlemen
lookin
fer
any
one
in
not
now
said
the
florid
one
we
found
him
the
spectacled
man
had
his
nose
quite
close
to
crow
badges
he
read
them
off
in
the
voice
and
manner
of
one
tremendously
impressed
grand
army
of
the
republic
sons
of
the
american
revolution
sons
of
veterans
tinkletown
battlefield
association
new
york
imperial
detective
association
bramble
county
detective
association
chief
of
fire
department
and
what
may
i
ask
is
the
little
round
button
at
the
top
the
marshal
was
astonished
do
you
know
what
that
is
it
does
appear
to
have
any
lettering
it
do
have
to
have
any
that
an
american
red
cross
button
so
it
is
so
it
is
cried
the
other
hastily
how
stupid
of
me
and
this
one
on
the
other
lapel
is
a
liberty
loan
button
one
hundred
dollars
is
what
it
represents
if
anybody
should
ast
you
i
recognized
it
at
once
sir
i
have
one
of
my
own
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
own
lapel
why
hang
it
all
i
forgot
to
remove
it
from
my
other
coat
this
morning
well
said
anderson
drily
there
to
be
some
advantage
in
havin
only
one
coat
mr
marshal
cut
in
the
larger
man
brusquely
we
came
to
see
you
in
regard
to
a
matter
of
great
importance
and
i
may
add
privacy
having
heard
of
your
reputation
for
cleverness
and
infallibility
as
everybody
in
the
land
has
heard
put
in
the
we
desire
your
in
an
undertaking
of
considerable
magnitude
quite
frankly
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
succeed
without
your
valuable
assistance
you
hold
on
if
you
tryin
to
get
me
to
subscribe
to
a
set
of
books
so
my
name
at
the
head
of
the
list
will
drag
other
suckers
into
not
at
all
sir
not
at
all
we
are
not
mr
marshal
well
what
are
ye
metallurgists
said
the
florid
one
i
see
i
see
said
anderson
who
did
see
at
all
you
started
off
just
like
a
er
a
salesman
my
name
is
bacon
george
washington
bacon
and
my
friend
bears
an
even
nobler
monicker
if
that
be
possible
he
is
abraham
lincoln
bonaparte
a
direct
descendant
of
both
of
those
illustrious
gentlemen
you
do
say
i
did
know
lincoln
was
any
connection
of
bonaparte
it
is
generally
known
the
descendant
informed
him
with
becoming
modesty
well
i
years
old
an
i
never
heard
gasped
bonaparte
incredulously
i
do
believe
it
you
ca
be
more
than
fifty
mr
crow
do
you
suppose
i
fought
in
the
union
army
before
i
was
born
demanded
crow
where
i
get
this
badge
lem
me
ast
you
an
you
do
think
the
citizens
of
this
here
town
would
elect
a
boy
to
the
responsible
position
of
town
marshal
do
you
why
gosh
snap
it
i
been
marshal
o
tinkletown
fer
forty
years
skippin
two
years
back
in
the
nineties
when
i
retired
in
favour
of
ed
higgins
owin
to
a
misunderstandin
concernin
my
health
an
it
is
incredible
sir
you
are
the
man
for
your
years
i
ever
seen
but
we
are
digressing
proceed
bacon
pardon
the
interruption
marshal
crow
had
drawn
himself
up
to
his
full
height
a
good
six
feet
and
expanding
under
the
influence
of
a
just
pride
his
chest
came
perilously
near
to
dislodging
a
couple
of
brass
buttons
his
keen
little
grey
eyes
snapped
brightly
in
their
deep
sockets
his
sparse
chin
whiskers
responding
to
the
occasion
bristled
noticeably
employing
his
thumb
and
forefinger
he
first
gave
his
beard
a
short
caress
after
which
he
drew
it
safely
out
of
line
and
expectorated
thinly
between
his
teeth
with
such
astounding
accuracy
that
both
of
the
strangers
stared
his
objective
was
a
narrow
slit
in
the
across
the
sidewalk
i
could
do
that
in
a
thousand
years
said
bacon
deeply
impressed
you
could
do
it
in
half
that
time
if
you
lived
in
tinkletown
was
anderson
cryptic
return
you
ought
to
see
ed
higgins
he
our
champeen
his
specialty
is
ed
hit
are
you
interested
in
metallurgy
mr
crow
broke
in
bacon
a
little
rudely
anderson
pondered
a
few
seconds
squinting
at
the
the
two
strangers
waited
his
reply
with
evident
concern
sometimes
i
am
an
sometimes
i
ai
said
he
at
last
very
seriously
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
shake
his
head
slowly
as
if
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
he
had
made
a
study
of
the
subject
and
had
not
been
able
to
arrive
at
a
definite
conclusion
good
exclaimed
bonaparte
that
proves
crow
that
you
are
a
man
of
very
great
discernment
very
great
discernment
indeed
crow
brightened
perceptibly
i
have
to
know
a
little
of
everything
in
my
line
of
work
mr
lincoln
bonaparte
made
no
attempt
to
correct
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
a
moment
or
two
he
was
in
some
doubt
himself
it
was
only
after
indulging
in
a
hasty
bit
of
mental
jugglery
that
he
decided
his
friend
possibly
have
introduced
him
as
bonaparte
abraham
lincoln
or
abraham
bonaparte
lincoln
he
wished
however
that
he
had
paid
a
little
closer
attention
when
george
washington
bacon
arranged
his
names
for
him
we
should
like
to
have
a
few
minutes
private
conversation
with
you
mr
marshal
said
bacon
lowering
his
voice
fire
away
gents
i
ahem
i
said
private
mr
crow
well
if
it
anything
you
do
want
the
birds
to
hear
i
guess
better
go
up
to
the
house
if
you
do
mind
that
woodpecker
up
yander
an
them
two
sparrers
out
there
in
the
road
i
guess
this
is
about
as
private
a
place
as
you
find
in
tinkletown
have
you
an
office
mr
crow
demanded
bacon
yes
but
it
ai
private
whenever
i
got
anything
private
to
to
er
even
about
i
allus
go
out
in
the
middle
of
the
street
shoot
ahead
nobody
hear
you
it
will
take
some
little
time
explained
bonaparte
anxiously
have
you
had
your
dinner
anderson
looked
at
him
keenly
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
bonaparte
means
supper
explained
bacon
he
is
a
bit
excited
mr
crow
he
be
agreed
anderson
glancing
at
his
watch
six
go
ahead
we
wo
be
interrupted
now
till
it
time
to
go
to
bed
the
two
strangers
in
tinkletown
drew
still
closer
so
close
indeed
that
the
town
marshal
having
had
his
pocket
picked
once
or
twice
at
the
county
fair
fell
back
a
little
from
the
fence
you
must
be
careful
to
show
no
sign
of
surprise
crow
said
bacon
what
i
am
about
to
say
to
you
may
startle
you
but
you
anderson
reassured
him
with
a
gesture
perceed
he
said
whereupon
the
spokesman
bacon
did
a
tale
unfold
that
caused
the
town
marshal
to
lie
awake
nearly
all
night
and
to
pop
out
of
bed
the
next
morning
fully
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
for
the
time
being
however
he
succeeded
so
admirably
in
simulating
indifference
that
the
men
themselves
were
not
only
surprised
but
a
trifle
disturbed
he
conducting
himself
at
all
as
they
had
expected
at
the
conclusion
of
this
serious
fifteen
minutes
recital
rendered
into
paragraphs
by
anderson
frequent
interruptions
the
eager
bonaparte
exclaimed
well
crow
does
it
completely
bowl
you
over
what
that
bowl
me
over
i
should
say
not
why
i
knowed
fer
i
tell
you
how
long
that
there
gold
up
yander
in
my
piece
of
timberland
on
crow
mountain
knowed
it
ever
since
i
was
a
boy
his
hearers
blinked
rapidly
for
a
few
seconds
really
murmured
bacon
do
you
mean
to
say
there
actually
gold
began
bonaparte
but
he
got
no
farther
whether
accidentally
or
otherwise
bacon
foot
came
sharply
into
contact
with
the
speaker
shin
and
the
question
terminated
in
a
pained
look
of
surprise
directed
with
some
intensity
and
a
great
deal
of
fortitude
at
nothing
in
particular
well
you
a
wonder
crow
said
bacon
hastily
i
am
immensely
relieved
that
you
know
of
its
existence
it
simplifies
matters
tremendously
it
has
been
there
all
the
time
and
you
never
known
just
how
to
go
about
getting
it
out
of
the
ground
is
that
the
case
mr
crow
exactly
said
crow
bacon
shot
a
significant
look
at
bonaparte
and
that
worthy
put
his
hand
suddenly
to
his
mouth
well
that
what
we
here
for
crow
to
get
that
gold
out
of
the
earth
if
our
estimates
are
correct
or
i
should
say
if
our
investigations
establish
the
fact
that
it
is
a
real
vein
and
not
merely
a
little
pocket
there
ought
to
be
a
million
dollars
in
that
piece
of
land
of
yours
now
let
me
see
just
how
much
land
do
you
own
up
there
mr
crow
i
own
derned
near
all
of
it
said
the
marshal
promptly
acres
i
should
say
nothing
but
timberland
i
assume
judging
from
what
we
have
been
able
to
observe
all
timber
never
been
cleared
purty
well
down
the
slope
and
it
is
about
five
miles
as
the
crow
flies
from
tinkletown
eh
i
ginerally
say
as
the
wild
goose
flies
said
crow
somewhat
curtly
well
you
have
heard
the
proposition
i
bring
from
my
employers
in
new
york
city
think
it
over
tonight
crow
then
we
will
meet
tomorrow
morning
at
your
office
to
complete
our
plans
i
shall
be
prepared
to
hand
you
a
draft
for
two
hundred
dollars
to
bind
the
bargain
what
time
do
you
reach
your
office
ginerally
between
six
and
a
my
god
muttered
bonaparte
we
will
be
there
at
said
bacon
firmly
good
evening
mr
crow
far
in
the
night
crow
peevishly
mumbled
to
her
bedfellow
what
ails

anderson
crow
go
to
sleep
never
mind

ca

i
say

ast
another
question
till
five
an
then
all
you
got
to
do
it
to
ast
me
if
i
awake
umph
said
crow
bacon
and
bonaparte
were
an
hour
and
forty
minutes
late
it
was
nearly
eight
when
the
two
gentlemen
came
hurrying
around
the
corner
into
sickle
street
piloted
by
alf
reesling
the
town
drunkard
a
long
cigar
propitiated
crow
and
after
reesling
and
other
citizens
had
been
given
to
understand
that
the
strangers
were
figuring
on
buying
all
the
timber
on
crow
mountain
the
three
principals
set
forth
in
anderson
buckboard
in
due
time
they
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
now
mountain
was
no
mountain
at
all
it
was
a
thickly
wooded
hill
that
had
achieved
eminence
by
happening
to
be
a
scant
fifty
feet
higher
than
the
knolls
surrounding
it
from
the
pastures
and
to
the
top
of
the
outstanding
pine
that
reared
its
blasted
tip
far
above
its
fellows
the
elevation
was
not
more
than
three
hundred
feet
nevertheless
it
was
the
loftiest
hill
in
all
that
region
and
capped
anderson
crow
agricultural
possessions
just
before
the
boggs
city
national
bank
at
the
county
seat
closed
that
afternoon
crow
appeared
at
the
window
he
deposited
two
hundred
dollars
in
currency
bacon
had
decided
that
a
draft
on
new
york
might
excite
undue
curiosity
if
people
were
to
get
wise
to
what
we
are
really
after
up
here
on
this
mountain
crow
said
he
it
would
play
hob
with
everything
if
it
gets
out
that
we
are
after
gold
why
the
price
of
land
would
be
so
high
we
could
lot
of
these
hayseeds
been
wantin
to
sell
fer
years
the
derned
rubes
broke
in
anderson
pityingly
well
you
get
me
do
you
keep
our
eyes
open
and
our
mouths
closed
and
we
will
be
millionaires
inside
of
a
year
or
two
at
the
outside
mum
the
word
as
the
feller
said
agreed
crow
and
of
course
you
see
the
advisability
of
having
our
articles
of
incorporation
filed
secretly
in
new
jersey
this
contract
we
have
signed
will
be
ratified
by
our
employers
in
new
york
and
the
regular
articles
drawn
up
at
once
wait
till
you
see
the
names
of
the
men
who
are
behind
this
enterprise
the
first
meeting
of
the
board
of
directors
will
bring
together
a
dozen
of
the
greatest
where
will
the
meetin
be
held
broke
in
anderson
somewhat
anxiously
new
york
city
of
course
it
would
surprise
me
in
the
least
to
see
you
elected
president
of
the
corporation
mr
crow
oh
i
i
ca
accept
the
honour
bacon
it
too
much
of
a
responsibility
besides
i
do
see
how
i
goin
to
be
able
to
get
away
from
tinkletown
this
fall
to
attend
the
meetin
the
county
fair
opens
next
week
at
boggs
city
an
the
second
week
in
october
there
to
be
a
baptist
revival
you
can
send
in
your
proxy
crow
explained
bacon
it
will
be
all
the
same
to
us
you
know
well
i
guess
i
better
said
anderson
thoughtfully
a
fortnight
went
by
crow
mountain
had
become
the
scene
of
sharp
but
stealthy
activity
anderson
went
about
the
streets
of
tinkletown
as
if
in
a
daze
acting
upon
the
stern
almost
offensive
advice
of
his
new
partners
he
did
not
go
near
the
mountain
after
the
first
couple
of
days
they
made
it
very
plain
to
him
that
depended
on
his
shrewdness
in
staying
away
from
the
mountain
altogether
the
tinkletown
in
reporting
the
vast
transaction
incorporated
an
interview
with
bacon
who
announced
that
the
syndicate
he
represented
had
in
mind
a
project
to
erect
a
huge
summer
hotel
on
top
of
the
most
beautiful
mountain
east
of
the
rockies
in
the
event
that
satisfactory
terms
could
be
arranged
with
crow
as
a
matter
of
fact
explained
bacon
he
had
been
instructed
to
make
certain
preliminary
investigations
in
regard
to
construction
and
so
forth
such
as
ascertaining
how
far
down
they
would
have
to
go
to
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
practically
all
of
the
syndicate
preparatory
work
on
crow
mountain
was
done
under
cover
of
night
that
were
said
to
have
been
driven
all
the
way
from
pittsburgh
on
account
of
the
dreadful
congestion
on
the
railroads
delivered
machinery
tools
drills
rods
bolts
rivets
and
thin
jangling
strips
of
structural
steel
marshal
crow
assuming
an
importance
he
did
not
feel
strutted
about
tinkletown
his
abstraction
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
accident
to
old
twiggers
he
was
dreamily
cogitating
at
the
time
she
was
run
down
by
schultz
and
as
the
catastrophe
took
place
almost
under
his
nose
more
than
one
citizen
called
him
names
he
would
forget
the
old
lady
had
her
spectacles
smashed
and
lost
a
dozen
eggs
in
the
confusion
moreover
ed
higgins
was
robbed
and
three
tramps
spent
as
much
as
half
a
day
on
main
street
before
anderson
took
any
notice
of
them
ordinarily
he
was
death
on
tramps
crime
as
harry
squires
put
it
in
a
caustic
editorial
in
the
was
rampant
in
tinkletown
it
was
getting
so
rampant
he
complained
that
it
safe
to
cross
the
street
especially
while
eggs
were
retailing
at
cents
a
dozen
it
remained
for
alf
reesling
the
town
drunkard
to
bring
order
out
of
chaos
not
that
he
seized
the
opportunity
to
go
on
a
spree
while
anderson
was
not
at
all
alf
loathed
intoxicating
liquors
he
did
not
drink
himself
and
he
had
a
horror
of
any
one
who
did
he
had
been
drunk
just
three
times
in
his
life
but
as
he
had
managed
to
crowd
the
three
exhibitions
into
the
space
of
one
week
some
twenty
years
before
tinkletown
elected
him
forthwith
for
life
to
the
office
of
town
sot
now
alf
had
a
grievance
he
finally
got
the
ear
of
marshal
crow
and
let
loose
in
a
way
that
startled
the
old
man
out
of
his
daze

bonyparte

eyed
him
sternly
for
a
moment
i
got
half
a
notion
to
run
you

alf
reesling

suddenly
affable
i

anderson
loftily
i

my
own
business
if

without
havin
a
charge
of

filed
him
lem
me
tell
you
that
git
out
o
my
way
alf
crow
pride
had
been
touched
the
shaft
of
criticism
had
gone
home
he
would
arrest
abraham
lincoln
bonaparte
no
matter
what
came
of
it
he
did
not
like
bonaparte
anyway
it
was
bonaparte
who
had
ordered
him
off
crow
mountain
his
own
mountain
mind
you
and
told
him
not
to
come
puttering
around
there
any
more
on
second
thoughts
he
accepted
the
nominal
town
sot
offer
to
make
affidavit
against
a
real
offender
but
declined
his
company
and
assistance
in
effecting
the
arrest
down
in
the
old
marshal
heart
lurked
the
fear
that
his
new
partners
would
put
up
such
strenuous
objections
to
the
arrest
that
he
would
have
to
give
way
to
them
it
was
this
misgiving
that
caused
him
to
make
the
trip
to
crow
mountain
instead
of
confronting
his
man
that
evening
at
the
hotel
or
in
the
street
in
the
presence
of
an
audience
arriving
at
the
half
a
mile
from
the
foot
of
mountain
he
encountered
two
men
tinkering
with
the
engine
of
a
big
automobile
they
stopped
him
and
inquired
if
there
was
a
garage
nearby
while
he
was
directing
them
to
pete
olsen
in
town
he
espied
two
more
men
reposing
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
farther
up
the
lane
as
he
drove
on
leaving
them
behind
he
found
himself
possessed
of
the
notion
that
the
two
men
were
strangely
nervous
and
impatient
he
decided
after
he
had
gone
a
half
mile
farther
that
they
had
as
a
acted
in
a
very
suspicious
manner
just
as
automobile
thieves
might
be
expected
to
act
in
the
presence
of
an
officer
of
the
law
he
made
up
his
mind
that
if
they
were
still
there
when
he
returned
with
his
prisoner
he
would
yank
up
for
investigation
he
went
through
the
motions
of
hitching
old
hip
and
jim
to
a
sapling
near
the
top
of
the
mountain
they
went
to
sleep
almost
instantly
in
the
little
clearing
off
to
the
left
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
away
marshal
crow
observed
several
men
at
work
constructing
a
shanty
closer
at
hand
almost
lost
to
view
among
the
pines
rose
the
thin
steel
tower
from
which
the
drill
was
to
be
operated
standing
out
among
the
were
the
long
of
steel
and
from
them
ran
the
guy
wires
to
the
ground
below
crow
had
never
seen
a
drill
before
but
he
had
been
told
by
bacon
that
this
was
the
newest
thing
on
the
market
the
marshal
started
off
in
the
direction
of
the
shanty
and
suddenly
a
most
astonishing
thing
happened
crow
disappeared
from
view
as
if
by
magic
illustration
marshal
started
off
in
the
direction
of
the
shanty
in
order
to
give
the
drill
as
wide
a
berth
as
possible
he
had
deployed
widely
to
the
left
of
the
path
making
his
way
somewhat
tortuously
through
a
rough
lot
of
underbrush
without
the
slightest
warning
the
earth
gave
way
beneath
him
and
down
he
shot
clawing
frantically
at
the
edges
of
a
hole
in
the
ground
taking
with
him
a
vast
amount
of
twigs
branches
and
a
of
sapling
poles
not
only
did
he
drop
a
good
twelve
feet
but
he
landed
squarely
upon
the
stooping
person
of
bacon
who
emitted
a
startling
sound
that
began
as
a
yell
and
ended
as
a
grunt
he
then
crumpled
up
and
spread
himself
out
flat
with
crow
draped
awkwardly
across
his
prostrate
form
for
the
time
being
bacon
was
as
still
as
the
grave
he
was
out
anderson
scrambled
to
his
feet
pawing
the
air
with
his
hands
his
eyes
tightly
shut
he
was
yelling
for
help
now
it
was
this
yelling
for
help
that
deceived
the
astonished
bonaparte
he
jumped
at
once
to
the
conclusion
that
the
marshal
was
calling
for
assistance
from
the
so
he
threw
up
his
hands
i
surrender
i
give
in
he
yelled
keep
them
off
do
let
them
get
at
me
illustration
i
i
surrender
i
give
in
he
anderson
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
he
found
himself
in
a
small
squat
room
lighted
by
a
lantern
which
stood
upon
a
crudely
made
table
in
the
corner
beyond
bonaparte
there
was
a
board
floor
well
littered
with
soil
and
shavings
in
another
corner
stood
a
singular
looking
contraption
not
unlike
a
dynamo
marshal
crow
bethought
himself
of
his
mission
although
the
breath
had
been
jarred
out
of
his
body
he
managed
to
say
explosively
i
i
got
a
warrant
for
your
arrest
come
along
now
do
resist
make
a
fuss
come
along
peaceably
i
i
come
crow
i
was
dragged
into
this
thing
against
my
will
in
himmel
gott
never
mind
what
you
got
exclaimed
anderson
sharply
you
come
along
with
me
or
you
get
something
that
is
is
he
dead
groaned
bonaparte
his
eyes
almost
starting
from
his
head
anderson
backed
away
from
the
sprawling
motionless
figure
on
the
floor
i
i
gosh
i
hope
not
i
i
was
as
much
surprised
as
anybody
say
you
see
if
he
breathin
we
got
to
git
him
out
o
this
place
right
away
an
send
for
a
doctor
the
good
lord
knows
i
did
intend
to
light
on
him
like
that
it
was
an
accident
i
swear
it
was
you
know
just
how
it
happened
an
you
stand
by
me
wo
you
if
just
then
a
loud
voice
came
from
above
hey
down
there
a
second
pause
then
we
got
you
dead
to
rights
so
no
monkey
business
come
up
out
o
that
or
we
pump
enough
lead
down
there
to
do
shoot
do
shoot
yelled
bonaparte
shrilly
tell
your
men
not
to
fire
mr
crow
tell
tell
cried
anderson
blankly
suddenly
he
sprang
to
his
companion
side
seizing
him
by
the
arm
he
whispered
hoarsely
by
gosh
i
thought
there
was
somethin
queer
about
that
gang
have
you
got
any
of
the
gold
here
i
recollect
that
feller
voice
plain
as
day
they
after
the
gold
they
heard
about
are
you
coming
up
roared
the
voice
from
the
outer
world
who
are
you
called
back
anderson
stoutly
oh
i
guess
you
recognize
united
states
marshals
when
you
see
come
on
now
abraham
lincoln
bonaparte
faced
marshal
crow
the
truth
dawning
upon
him
like
a
flash
you
damned
old
rube
he
snarled
and
forthwith
planted
his
fist
under
anderson
with
such
surprising
force
that
the
old
man
once
more
landed
heavily
on
the
prostrate
form
of
the
unfortunate
bacon
gosh
groaned
anderson
and
as
his
eyes
rolled
upward
he
saw
a
million
stars
chasing
each
other
around
the
ceiling
i
get
much
satisfaction
out
of
it
anyhow
he
heard
some
one
say
from
a
very
great
distance
sometime
afterward
he
was
dimly
aware
of
a
jumble
of
excited
voices
about
him
some
one
was
shouting
in
his
ear
he
opened
his
eyes
and
everything
looked
green
before
them
in
time
he
recognized
pine
trees
very
lofty
pine
trees
that
slowly
but
surely
shrank
in
size
as
he
gazed
wonderingly
at
them
there
were
a
lot
of
strange
men
surrounding
him
out
of
the
mass
he
finally
selected
a
face
that
grew
upon
him
it
was
the
face
of
alf
reesling
by
jinks
anderson
you
done
it
time
alf
cried
excitedly
i
told
you

way

jinks
i
knowed

get
le
lem
me
set
down
please
mumbled
anderson
and
the
two
men
who
supported
him
lowered
him
gently
to
the
ground
with
his
back
against
a
tree
trunk
come
here
alf
he
called
out
feebly
alf
shuffled
forward
who

men
whispered
anderson
detectives
detectives
replied
alf
united
states
detectives
what

anderson
who
had
done
a
good
deal
of
reading
in
his
time
i
started
out
after
you
on
my
wheel
andy
thinkin
maybe
you
have
trouble
down
the
road
i
met
up
with
these
fellers
in
a
big
automobile
they
stopped
me
an
said
i
could
go
up
the
hill
just
then
up

another
car
full
of
men

seemed
to
be
acquainted

till
after
they
hauled

the
what
ole
kaiser
bill
say
you
was
down
there
quite
a
little
spell
an
they
wo
let
me
go
down
what
does
a
wireless
plant
look
like
anderson
that
evening
marshal
crow
sat
on
the
porch
in
front
of
lamson
store
smoking
a
fine
cigar
presented
to
him
by
harry
squires
reporter
for
the
he
had
a
large
audience
indeed
he
was
obliged
to
raise
his
voice
considerably
in
order
to
reach
the
outer
rim
he
had
been
called
a
hero
a
fearless
officer
and
a
lot
of
other
pleasant
things
by
the
astonished
united
states
marshals
and
he
had
been
given
to
understand
that
he
would
hear
from
washington
before
long
bacon
kurt
von
poppenblitz
and
bonaparte
conrad
bloom
had
also
called
him
something
but
he
did
mind
his
erstwhile
partners
with
their
four
or
five
henchmen
were
now
well
on
their
way
to
limbo
and
crow
was
regaling
his
hearers
with
the
story
during
the
first
recital
this
being
either
the
ninth
or
tenth
alf
reesling
had
been
obliged
to
prompt
him
a
circumstance
readily
explainable
when
one
stops
to
consider
the
effect
of
the
murderous
blow
crow
had
received
said
anderson
they
fool
me
at
first
but
i
long
gittin
onto
i
used
to
sneak
up
there
and
investigate
now
an
finally
i
got
onto
the
fact
that
they
was
german
spies
i
got
positive
proof
of
it
i
ca
tell
you
just
what
it
is
government
business
then
i
finds
out
they
got
a
wireless
plant
all
in
order
an
ready
to
relay
messages
to
the
coast
o
maine
from
out
west
so
today
i
goes
over
to
justice
robb
and
gits
a
warrant
for
intoxication
that
was
to
make
it
legal
fer
me
to
bust
into
their
shanty
if
necessary
course
the
drunk
charge
was
only
a
blind
as
i
told
the
marshal
i
went
right
straight
to
that
underground
den
o
an
afore
they
knowed
what
was
up
i
leaped
down
on
fust
thing
i
done
was
to
put
the
big
and
dangerous
one
horse
de
combat
he
was
the
one
i
was
worried
about
i
knocked
him
flat
an
then
went
after
one
he
let
on
like
he
was
surrenderin
he
fooled
me
i
admit
i
do
know
anything
wireless
machinery
all
of
a
sudden
he
give
me
a
wireless
shock
out
o
nowhere
you
might
say
an
well
by
cracky
i
thought
it
was
all
over
i
realize
now
it
was
foolish
o
me
to
try
to
go
up
there
an
take
them
two
desperadoes
but
i
what
that
bud
crow
sent
me
to
tell
you
if
you
did
come
home
to
supper
this
minute
you
would
git
any
called
out
a
boy
from
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
that
the
second
wireless
shock
you
had
today
anderson
said
harry
squires
drily
and
slowly
closed
one
eye
the
best
man
wins
anderson
crow
meets
his
waterloo
and
his
marne
for
sixteen
consecutive
years
anderson
crow
had
been
the
marshal
of
tinkletown
a
hiatus
of
two
years
separated
this
period
of
service
from
another
which
according
to
persons
of
apparently
infallible
memory
ran
through
an
unbroken
stretch
of
years
uncle
gid
luce
stoutly
maintained
and
with
some
authority
that
anybody
who
said
years
was
either
mistaken
or
lying
he
knew
for
a
positive
fact
that
it
was
only
for
the
simple
reason
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
crow
dynasty
a
full
year
elapsed
before
anderson
could
be
convinced
that
he
actually
had
been
victorious
at
the
polls
over
his
venerable
predecessor
bunker
who
had
served
uninterruptedly
for
something
like
thirty
years
before
him
it
took
the
wisest
men
in
town
nearly
a
year
to
persuade
the
incredulous
bunker
that
he
had
been
defeated
and
also
to
prove
to
crow
that
he
had
been
elected
neither
one
of
would
believe
it
it
was
the
consensus
of
opinion
however
that
anderson
crow
had
served
all
told
years
the
aforesaid
hiatus
being
the
result
of
a
decision
on
his
part
to
permanently
abandon
public
life
in
order
to
carry
on
his
work
as
a
private
detective
ed
higgins
held
the
office
for
two
years
and
then
retired
claiming
that
there
any
sense
in
tinkletown
having
marshals
and
only
paying
for
one
and
as
the
salary
and
perquisites
were
too
meagre
to
warrant
a
division
and
the
duties
of
office
barely
sufficient
to
keep
man
awake
he
arrived
at
the
only
conclusion
possible
it
was
only
fair
that
he
should
split
even
with
anderson
after
thinking
it
over
for
some
time
he
decided
that
about
the
best
way
to
solve
the
problem
was
for
him
to
take
the
pay
and
allow
anderson
to
do
the
work
an
arrangement
that
was
eminently
satisfactory
to
the
entire
population
of
tinkletown
elections
were
held
biennially
every
two
years
in
the
spring
as
provided
by
statute
the
voters
of
tinkletown
unless
otherwise
engaged
ambled
up
to
the
polling
place
in
the
rear
of
undertaking
emporium
and
voted
not
only
for
anderson
crow
but
for
a
town
clerk
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
three
selectmen
no
one
ever
thought
of
voting
for
any
one
except
crow
once
and
only
once
was
there
an
opposition
candidate
for
the
office
of
town
marshal
it
is
on
record
that
he
did
not
receive
a
solitary
vote
republicans
and
democrats
voted
for
anderson
with
persistent
fidelity
and
while
there
were
notable
contests
for
the
other
offices
at
nearly
every
election
no
one
bothered
himself
about
the
the
regular
election
was
drawing
near
marshal
crow
was
mildly
concerned
not
about
himself
but
on
account
of
the
tremendous
battle
that
was
to
be
waged
for
the
office
of
town
clerk
henry
wimpelmeyer
the
proprietor
of
the
tanyard
had
come
out
for
the
office
and
was
spending
money
freely
the
incumbent
ezra
pounder
had
had
a
good
deal
of
sickness
in
his
family
during
the
winter
and
was
in
no
position
to
be
bountiful
moreover
ezra
was
further
handicapped
by
the
fact
that
nearly
every
voter
in
tinkletown
owed
money
to
henry
wimpelmeyer
inasmuch
as
it
was
just
the
other
way
round
with
ezra
it
may
be
seen
that
his
adversary
possessed
a
sickening
advantage
wimpelmeyer
could
afford
to
slap
every
one
on
the
back
and
jingle
his
pocketful
of
change
in
the
most
reckless
fashion
he
did
not
have
to
dodge
any
one
on
the
street
not
he
anderson
crow
was
a
strong
pounder
man
he
was
worried
henry
wimpelmeyer
had
openly
stated
that
if
he
were
elected
he
would
be
pleased
to
show
his
gratitude
to
his
friends
by
cancelling
every
obligation
due
him
he
was
planning
to
run
on
what
was
to
be
called
the
people
ticket
ezra
was
an
anderson
crow
republican
tinkletown
itself
was
largely
republican
the
democrats
never
had
a
chance
to
hold
office
except
when
there
was
a
democratic
president
at
washington
then
one
of
them
got
the
and
almost
immediately
began
to
show
signs
of
turning
republican
so
that
he
could
be
reasonably
certain
of
reappointment
at
the
end
of
his
four
years
anderson
crow
lay
awake
nights
trying
to
evolve
a
plan
by
which
henry
wimpelmeyer
astonishing
methods
could
be
overcome
that
frank
and
unchallenged
promise
to
cancel
all
debts
was
absolutely
certain
to
defeat
ezra
so
far
as
the
marshal
knew
no
one
owed
henry
more
than
five
dollars
in
most
cases
it
was
even
less
but
when
you
sat
down
and
figured
up
just
how
much
henry
would
ever
realize
in
hard
cash
on
these
accounts
even
if
he
waited
a
hundred
years
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
election
was
going
to
cost
him
a
dollar
for
example
alf
reesling
had
owed
him
a
dollar
and
cents
for
nearly
seven
years
alf
admitted
that
the
obligation
worried
him
a
great
deal
and
it
was
pretty
nearly
certain
that
he
would
jump
at
the
chance
to
be
relieved
other
items
henry
plumb
two
dollars
and
a
quarter
harvey
shortfork
ninety
cents
ben
pickett
a
rush
applegate
lum
gillespie
and
so
on
including
ezra
pounder
himself
who
owed
the
staggering
sum
of
eleven
dollars
and
cents
there
was
after
all
some
consolation
in
the
thought
that
ezra
would
be
benefited
to
that
extent
by
his
own
defeat
naturally
crow
gave
no
thought
to
his
own
candidacy
no
one
was
running
against
him
and
apparently
no
one
ever
would
therefore
crow
was
in
a
position
to
devote
his
apprehensions
exclusively
to
the
rest
of
the
ticket
and
to
ezra
pounder
in
particular
he
could
think
of
but
one
way
to
forestall
wimpelmeyer
and
that
was
by
digging
down
into
his
own
pocket
and
paying
in
cash
every
single
cent
that
the
electorate
of
tinkletown
owed
the
shylark
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
ascertain
almost
to
a
dollar
just
how
much
it
would
take
to
save
the
honour
of
tinkletown
finding
after
an
investigation
that
would
square
up
everything
and
leave
henry
high
and
dry
with
nothing
but
the
german
vote
to
depend
upon
there
were
exactly
eligible
voters
in
town
with
german
names
and
seven
of
them
professed
to
be
swiss
the
instant
the
united
states
went
into
the
war
crow
was
making
profound
calculation
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
when
alf
reesling
the
town
drunkard
came
scuttling
excitedly
around
the
corner
from
the
office
gee

gasped

full
ticket
las
night
over
at
odd
fellers
hall
anderson
submitted
himself
to
be
led
or
rather
dragged
around
the
corner
into
sickle
street
several
business
men
aroused
from
lassitude
allowed
their
chairs
to
come
down
with
a
thump
upon
divers
mercantile
porches
and
fell
in
behind
the
two
principal
citizens
of
tinkletown
something
terrible
must
have
happened
or
marshal
crow
would
be
summoned
in
any
such
imperative
manner
as
this

terrible
must
have
happened
or

such
imperative

what
up
anderson
called
out
mort
fryback
the
hardware
dealer
wavering
on
one
leg
while
he
reached
frantically
behind
him
for
his
crutch
mort
was
always
looking
for
excitement
he
had
had
any
to
speak
of
since
the
day
he
created
the
greatest
furor
the
town
had
experienced
in
years
by
losing
one
of
his
legs
under
an
extremely
heavy
kitchen
stove

there
a

half
a

away
jones
proprietor
of

produced

prepared
by
his
city
editor
harry

for
the
ensuing
issue
of
the
weekly
squires
himself
emerged
from
the
and
sarcastically
offered
his
condolences
to
anderson
crow
well
here
a
pretty
anderson
he
said
elevating
his
to
a
position
that
established
a
green
halo
over
a
perfectly
pink
pate
responded
anderson
with
unaccustomed
politeness
he
was
staring
hard
at
the
dirty
strip
of
paper
which
he
held
to
the
light
did
i
you
exclaimed
alf
reesling
triumphantly
there
she
is
right
before

reesling
employed
the
proper
gender
in
making
this
assertion
she
was
right
before
the
eyes
of
every
one
who
cared
to
look
anderson
slowly
read
off
the
ticket
his
voice
cracked
deplorably
as
he
pronounced
the
last
of
the
six

a
long
silence
followed
the
last
syllable
in

broken
at

by
marshal
crow
who
turned
upon
harry

and
demanded
what

been
sayin

declared
anderson
loudly
and
with
all
the
astuteness
of
the
experienced
politician
an
what

pursued
anderson
scornfully
i
that
whole
ticket
there
only
one
american
on
it
an
he

and
if
what
she
says
is
true
every
blessed
woman
in
tinkletown
is
going
to
vote
for
her
marshal
crow
sat
down
a
queer
dazed
look
in
his
eyes
by
gosh
i
i
never
thought
they
act
like
this
he
murmured
every
man
in
the
group
was
asking
the
same
question
in
the
back
of
his
startled
brain
has
wife
gone
an
got
mixed
up
in
this
scheme
of
minnie
without
sayin
anything
to
me
visions
of
feminine
supremacy
filled
the
mental
eye
of
a
suddenly
perturbed
constituency
the
realization
flashed
through
every
mind
that
if
the
women
of
tinkletown
stuck
solidly
together
there
was
the
ghost
of
a
chance
for
the
sex
that
had
been
in
the
saddle
since
the
world
began
an
unwitting
or
perhaps
a
designing
providence
had
populated
tinkletown
with
at
least
twenty
more
women
than
men
alf
reesling
was
the
first
to
speak
he
addressed
the
complacent
squires
i
know
one
woman
that
ai
goin
to
vote
for
minnie
stitzenberg
said
he
somewhat
fiercely
what
are
you
going
to
do
inquired
harry
mildly
kill
her
nothin
as
triflin
as
that
said
alf
i
goin
to
tell
my
wife
if
she
votes
for
minnie
i
pack
up
and
leave
her
minnie
sure
of

all
right
was
harry
comment
fully
ten
minutes
were
required
to
convince
the
marshal
that
minnie
stitzenberg
was
a
bona
fide
candidate
anderson
finally
arose
drew
himself
to
his
full
height
lifted
his
chin
and
faced
the
group
with
something
truly
martial
in
his
eye
feller
citizens
he
began
solemnly
the
time
has
come
for
us
men
to
stand
together
we
got
to
pertect
our
rights
we
got
to
let

well
up

the
time

preservin
humanity
an
civilization
an
all
the
women
an

we

i
ready
any
time
to
knuckle
under
to
a
man
that
i

but
i
if

willin
to
admit
that
minnie

that

sir
gentlemen
we
men
have
got
to
stand
together
hissed
mort
fryback
jerking
his
head
in
the
direction
of
main
street
with
one
accord
the
men
on
the
porch
turned
to
look
miss
minnie
stitzenberg
had
come
into
view
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
was
striding
manfully
in
their
direction
the
higgins
dog
trotted
proudly
confidently
a
few
feet
ahead
of
her
she
waved
a
friendly
hand
and
called
out
in
a
genial
but
ludicrous
effort
to
mimic
the
lordly
crow
move
on
there
now
do
loiter
a
little
later
the
agitated
town
marshal
flanked
by
the
town
drunkard
and
the
fryback
viewed
with
no
little
dismay
a
group
of
women
congregated
in
front
of
parr
drygoods
store
in
the
centre
of
this
group
was
the
new
candidate
for
town
marshal
alf
reesling
stopped
short
and
said
something
under
his
breath
his
wife
was
one
of
miss
stitzenberg
most
attentive
listeners
illustration
the
centre
of
this
group
was
the
new
candidate
for
town
marshal
crow
was
not
disheartened
he
knew
that
minnie
stitzenberg
could
not
defeat
him
at
the
polls
the
thing
that
rankled
was
the
fact
that
a
woman
had
been
selected
to
run
against
him
it
was
an
offence
to
his
dignity
the
leaders
of
the
people
party
made
it
quite
plain
that
they
did
not
consider
him
of
sufficient
importance
to
justify
anything
so
dignified
as
masculine
opposition
on
the
day
of
the
republican
convention
which
was
to
be
held
in
the
town
hall
in
the
evening
anderson
went
in
despair
and
humility
to
harry
squires
the
reporter
harry
he
said
i
been
thinkin
it
over
i
ca
run
a
woman
it
goes
the
grain
if
i
beat
her
i
never
be
able
to
look
anybody
in
the
face
an
if
she
beats
me
why
by
gosh
i
could
even
look
myself
in
the
face
so
i
goin
to
decline
the
nomination
tonight
he
was
rather
pathetic
and
harry
squires
was
touched
he
had
a
great
fondness
for
the
old
marshal
notwithstanding
his
habit
of
poking
fun
at
him
and
ridiculing
him
in
the
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
old
man
arm
and
there
was
genuine
warmth
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke
to
him
anderson
we
ca
allow
you
to
withdraw
it
would
be
the
vilest
thing
the
people
of
this
town
could
do
if
they
turned
you
out
of
office
after
all
these
years
of
faithful
service
we
ca
be
helped
harry
said
anderson
firmly
i
wo
run
a
woman
so
that
the
end
of
it
harry
looked
cautiously
around
and
then
leaning
a
little
closer
said
i
know
something
that
would
put
minnie
in
the
soup
clean
over
her
head
all
i
got
to
do
is
to
tell
what
i
know
about
hold
on
harry
broke
in
the
marshal
sternly
is
it
somethin
her
character
it
something
that
would
prevent
every
man
woman
and
child
in
tinkletown
from
voting
for
her
said
harry
somethin
demanded
anderson
perking
up
instantly
decidedly
a
word
from
me
and
wait
a
second
is
is
there
a
man
in
the
case
a
cried
harry
bless
your
soul
anderson
there
are
fifty
men
in
it
anderson
fell
back
a
step
or
two
for
a
moment
or
two
he
was
speechless
sakes
alive
for
goodness
sake
harry
are
you
sure
not
exactly
it
may
be
sixty
amended
harry
we
could
easily
find
out
just
how
many
never
mind
never
mind
cried
anderson
recovering
himself
if
as
bad
as
all
that
we
just
got
to
keep
still
about
it
i
would
allow
you
to
throw
mud
at
her
if
she
been
carryin
on
with
only
man
but
if
there
fifty
or
but
gosh
a
mighty
harry
it
ai
possible
a
woman
as
homely
as
minnie
why
it
a
woman
as
homely
as
she
is
simply
could
be
bad
no
matter
how
much
she
wanted
to
it
human
nature
she
hold
your
horses
anderson
broke
in
harry
after
a
perplexed
stare
i
guess
you
jumping
at
conclusions
i
did
say
there
ai
going
to
be
no
scandal
in
this
campaign
if
minnie
stitzenberg
german
or
no
german
has
been
it
is
the
kind
of
scandal
you
think
it
is
protested
harry
what
i
trying
to
tell
you
is
that
it
was
minnie
stitzenberg
who
got
that
guy
up
here
from
new
york
two
years
ago
to
sell
stock
in
the
salt
water
gold
company
and
stung
fifty
or
sixty
of
our
wisest
citizens
to
the
extent
of
thirty
dollars
apiece
i
happen
to
know
that
minnie
got
five
dollars
for
every
sucker
that
was
landed
that
guy
was
her
cousin
and
she
gave
him
a
list
of
the
easiest
marks
in
town
if
i
remember
correctly
you
were
one
of
them
anderson
she
got
something
like
two
hundred
dollars
for
giving
him
the
proper
steer
and
that
what
i
meant
when
i
said
there
were
fifty
or
sixty
men
in
the
case
well
i
be
and
do
you
know
what
she
did
with
her
gains
anderson
could
only
shake
his
head
she
went
up
to
boggs
city
and
took
singing
lessons
now
you
know
the
worst
the
marshal
found
his
voice
an
it
went
on
for
nearly
six
months
too
people
had
to
keep
their
windows
shut
so
they
could
hear
her
yellin
as
if
somebody
was
tryin
to
murder
her
an
when
i
went
to
her
an
respectfully
requested
her
to
quit
disturbin
the
peace
she
do
you
know
what
she
said
to
me
i
got
a
sneaking
idea
well
you
wrong
she
said
i
was
a
finicky
old
jackass
the
memory
of
it
brought
an
apoplectic
red
to
his
face
and
being
a
gentleman
you
could
deny
it
said
harry
soberly
what
that
i
mean
you
could
call
her
a
liar
what
did
you
say
i
looked
her
right
in
the
eyes
an
i
said
i
been
neutral
up
to
that
minute
but
from
then
on
i
be
derned
if
i
try
any
longer
by
gosh
i
guess
she
knowed
what
i
meant
all
right
well
as
i
was
saying
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
tell
the
voters
of
this
town
that
she
helped
put
up
that
job
on
them
and
anderson
held
up
his
hand
and
shook
his
head
resolutely
nope
i
through
i
not
goin
to
run
i
mean
to
withdraw
my
name
tonight
considering
the
matter
closed
he
sauntered
to
the
middle
of
the
street
where
he
held
up
his
hand
and
stopped
a
lame
and
venerable
ford
driven
or
as
squires
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
urged
by
deacon
rank
what
your
say
deacon
inquired
the
marshal
blandly
it
do
say
anything
snapped
the
deacon
anderson
saw
fit
to
indulge
in
sarcasm
well
by
gum
i
swore
your
old
machine
was
movin
is
it
possible
my
eyes
deceived
me
course
it
was
movin
movin
strictly
accordin
to
law
too
six
miles
an
hour
what
you
holdin
me
up
for
so
i
could
get
in
and
take
a
little
joy
ride
with
you
said
crow
affably
drop
me
at
the
post
office
will
you
he
stepped
up
beside
the
deacon
and
calmly
seated
himself
the
deacon
grumbled
a
hundred
yards
to
the
post
office
he
said
stoppin
me
like
this
an
an
makin
me
get
out
and
crank
the
car
besides
an
i
in
a
hurry
too
could
you
well
i
ai
in
no
hurry
if
i
was
do
you
suppose
i
walked
that
evening
the
town
hall
was
filled
with
discouraged
apprehensive
republicans
a
newly
enfranchised
women
occupied
front
seats
ed
higgins
confided
to
those
nearest
him
that
he
felt
as
though
he
was
in
church
and
alf
reesling
loudly
advised
the
convention
to
be
careful
as
there
were
ladies
present
hud
lamson
as
usual
was
the
chairman
of
the
convention
no
one
else
ever
had
a
chance
to
be
chairman
for
the
reason
that
hud
did
not
insist
upon
having
the
honour
thrust
upon
him
he
simply
it
following
the
usual
resolutions
condemning
the
democratic
party
to
perdition
and
at
the
same
time
eulogizing
the
democratic
administration
at
washington
ezra
pounder
was
nominated
by
acclamation
for
the
responsible
post
of
town
clerk
in
swift
succession
ed
higgins
abner
pickerell
and
situate
jones
were
chosen
for
selectmen
justice
robb
was
unanimously
chosen
to
succeed
himself
then
ensued
a
strange
significant
silence
a
silence
fraught
with
exceeding
gravity
and
the
portentous
suggestion
of
something
devastating
about
to
overtake
the
assemblage
some
one
in
the
back
of
the
hall
cleared
his
throat
and
instantly
with
one
accord
every
eye
was
turned
in
his
direction
it
was
as
if
he
were
clearing
the
way
for
action
harry
squires
the
perennial
secretary
of
all
conventions
held
by
all
parties
in
tinkletown
by
virtue
of
his
skill
with
the
pencil
arose
from
his
seat
and
stepped
to
the
front
of
the
platform
illustration
squires
stepped
to
the
front
of
the
order
called
out
marshal
crow
in
his
most
authoritative
voice
sweeping
the
convention
with
an
accusing
eye
chairman
fellow
republicans
and
voters
of
the
opposite
sex
began
harry
in
a
distinctly
lugubrious
tone
we
have
now
come
to
the
most
critical
moment
in
the
history
of
tinkletown
it
is
with
ineffable
sorrow
and
dismay
that
i
stand
before
you
this
evening
the
bearer
of
sad
tidings
on
the
other
hand
i
expect
to
derive
great
joy
in
offsetting
this
sad
news
later
on
in
my
humble
speech
i
am
now
gentlemen
and
ladies
speaking
of
our
most
noted
and
most
cherished
citizen
anderson
crow
known
to
you
all
i
believe
without
exception
i
at
this
juncture
up
jumped
alf
reesling
and
shouted
three
cheers
for
anderson
crow
and
three
cheers
were
given
with
a
vim
uncle
dad
simms
a
patriot
of
but
of
exceedingly
short
memory
took
the
convention
by
storm
by
crying
out
in
a
cracked
but
penetrating
voice
three
cheers
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
i
do
keer
if
he
is
a
democrat
come
on
now
men
three
cheers
for
president
cleveland
a
roar
of
laughter
went
up
and
uncle
dad
being
quite
deaf
followed
it
with
two
squeaky
cheers
all
by
himself
and
then
looked
about
in
triumph
alf
reesling
proposed
three
cheers
for
president
wilson
and
again
the
welkin
rang
having
established
a
success
as
a
promoter
of
enthusiasm
alf
mounted
a
chair
and
roared
now
let
give
three
cheers
for
general
pershing
an
the
boys
over
in
france
includin
the
four
noble
young
men
from
tinkletown
who
are
with
him
in
the
trenches
killin
the
botches
now
hip
hip
and
once
more
the
air
shivered
under
the
impact
of
vocal
enthusiasm
squires
held
up
his
hands
and
checked
what
might
have
become
a
habit
by
thanking
the
convention
for
the
timely
and
admirable
interruption
explaining
that
the
digression
had
given
him
an
opportunity
to
regain
command
of
his
emotions
it
is
however
with
pain
that
i
am
authorized
to
announce
not
only
to
the
glorious
republican
party
but
to
the
city
of
tinkletown
that
hold
on
alf
we
can
get
along
without
three
cheers
for
tinkletown
to
announce
that
the
name
of
anderson
crow
is
hereby
withdrawn
from
the
consideration
of
this
convention
for
the
er
the
nomination
for
town
marshal
crow
positively
declines
to
make
the
race
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
dilate
upon
the
manifold
virtues
and
accomplishments
of
our
distinguished
marshal
his
fame
extends
to
the
uttermost
corners
of
the
earth
for
nearly
half
a
century
he
has
kept
this
town
jogging
along
in
a
straight
and
narrow
path
and
i
for
one
and
i
feel
that
i
voice
the
sentiment
of
every
citizen
here
and
elsewhere
i
for
one
do
not
resent
the
frequent
reproaches
and
occasional
arrests
he
has
heaped
upon
me
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
it
was
all
for
the
good
of
the
community
and
i
am
proud
to
say
that
i
have
been
arrested
by
marshal
crow
more
times
than
i
have
fingers
and
toes
and
i
am
further
proud
to
add
that
on
not
a
single
occasion
did
marshal
crow
hesitate
to
admit
that
he
was
mistaken
gentlemen
it
takes
a
pretty
big
man
to
admit
that
he
is
mistaken
but
if
you
will
read
the
next
issue
of
the
you
will
see
that
i
can
write
about
him
much
more
eloquently
than
i
can
speak
he
has
positively
decided
not
to
be
a
candidate
for
while
we
are
thereby
plunged
into
grief
of
the
darkest
hue
i
am
here
to
tell
you
that
our
grief
is
mitigated
by
the
most
gorgeous
ray
of
light
that
ever
beamed
upon
the
human
race
it
is
my
pleasure
gentlemen
of
the
republican
party
and
ladies
of
the
same
sect
to
present
for
your
alf
reesling
voice
was
heard
in
plaintive
protest
he
spoke
to
his
elbow
neighbour
but
in
a
tone
audible
to
every
one
far
and
near
i
be
if
i
stand
for
that
it
an
insult
to
every
man
here
to
say
they
are
of
the
same
sex
we
give
the
vote
and
by
gosh
they
claim
our
sex
i
order
commanded
marshal
crow
the
orator
resumed
it
is
my
privilege
to
present
for
your
consideration
the
name
of
one
of
our
most
illustrious
citizens
for
the
honourable
office
of
town
marshal
a
name
that
is
a
household
word
second
only
to
that
of
the
present
incumbent
circumstances
over
which
we
have
no
control
although
we
did
have
it
up
to
a
short
time
ago
make
it
possible
for
me
to
present
to
you
a
name
that
will
go
down
in
history
as
one
of
the
grandest
since
the
bonny
days
of
good
queen
bess
gentlemen
and
at
the
same
time
ladies
i
have
the
honour
to
put
in
nomination
for
town
marshal
our
distinguished
fellow
voter
anderson
crow
a
silence
even
more
potential
than
the
one
preceding
peroration
ensued
it
was
broken
this
time
by
uncle
dad
simms
who
proceeded
to
further
glorify
his
deafness
by
squeaking
and
he
be
elected
too
you
bet
your
boots
we
do
want
no
woman
fer
eh
what
say
alf
and
alf
making
a
cup
of
his
hands
repeated
with
great
vigour
an
inch
or
so
from
uncle
dad
ear
the
timely
remark
that
had
caused
the
ancient
to
hesitate
it
is
not
necessary
to
quote
alf
but
uncle
dad
rejoinder
is
important
well
he
gasped
is
there
a
second
to
the
nomination
inquired
the
chairman
marshal
crow
arose
i
second
the
nomination
he
said
taking
a
sudden
tug
at
his
whiskers
before
we
take
a
ballot
chairman
i
want
to
say
right
here
an
now
that
crow
will
have
my
full
an
undivided
support
just
as
she
has
always
had
i
have
allus
maintained
that
a
woman
place
is
in
the
home
therefore
when
it
comes
time
fer
crow
to
assume
the
responsibilities
of
this
here
office
i
am
goin
to
see
to
it
that
she
home
an
tends
to
her
household
duties
i
am
goin
to
be
deputy
marshal
durin
her
term
of
office
without
pay
ladies
an
gentlemen
an
i
am
goin
to
lift
every
bit
o
the
work
her
shoulders
i
believe
in
equal
sufferin
if
she
do
the
share
o
the
work
i
do
the
man
an
nothin
could
be
fairer
than
that
between
us
we
give
the
city
o
tinkletown
the
best
administration
the
office
of
marshal
has
ever
had
my
wife
ai
here
tonight
to
accept
the
honour
you
are
goin
to
heap
on
her
but
i
think
i
can
safely
promise
she
consent
to
make
the
race
she
may
kick
like
a
bay
steer
at
first
but
when
she
sees
it
her
to
run
you
bet
she
do
it
it
a
case
of
woman
woman
feller
republicans
man
man
all
i
got
to
say
is
that
the
best
woman
bound
to
win
i
almost
forgot
to
say
that
if
the
voters
o
tinkletown
do
jump
at
the
chance
to
git
a
marshal
an
a
experienced
deputy
for
the
price
o
one
salary
it
because
there
more
derned
fools
in
the
town
than

thought
there
was
ed
higgins

to
his
feet
i
move
chairman
that

a
dissenting
vote

cried
out

chance
to

best
deputy

the
united
states
of
america
without
it
costin

red
cent
an
besides
that
we
get
the
best
cook
in
all
tinkletown
for

or

cried
out
one
of
the
women
bridling
a
little
and
i
want
to
say
to
you
ed
higgins
that
while
i
think

the
chairman
every
hand
went
up
then
a
rousing
cheer
was
given
for
the
next
marshal
of
tinkletown
followed
by
the
customary
mumbling
of
the
star
spangled
banner
three
full
days
were
devoted
by
anderson
and
the
leaders
of
the
republican
party
to
the
task
of
inducing
crow
to
make
the
race
against
minnie
stitzenberg
at

refused

did
intend
to
neglect
her
household
duties
for

offices
in

certainly
anderson
made
haste
to
assure
her
unofficially
course
he
went
on
with
profound
regard
for
the
ethics
involved
well
i
think
it
over
she
said
wearily
do
bother
me
now
you
two
ca
you
see
i
making
apple
butter
i
hope
you
will
consent
to
run
crow
put
in
the
wily
squires
if
only
for
the
sake
of
showing
minnie
stitzenberg
that
it
wo
do
her
any
good
to
be
saying
things
about
well
about
anybody
in
particular
he
concluded
very
lamely
has
that
woman
been
saying
things
about
me
demanded
crow
i
ought
to
have
sense
enough
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
said
harry
scowling
darkly
catching
the
astonished
look
on
anderson
face
he
hastily
suggested
that
they
beat
it
out
in
the
front
yard
anderson
halted
him
has
minnie
been
saying
anything
about
my
wife
harry
squires
harry
first
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
then
winked
not
that
i
know
of
he
said
chuckling
but
i
guess
it
safe
to
go
ahead
and
print
the
ticket
with
crow
name
on
it
never
in
all
its
sedentary
existence
had
tinkletown
experienced
a
livelier
campaign
if
you
vote
for
minnie
stitzenberg
i
never
speak
to
you
again
was
the
common
argument
of
the
crowites
and
do
you
ever
try
to
look
me
in
the
face
again
if
you
vote
for
that
old
crow
was
the
slogan
of
the
opposition
crow
conducted
her
own
campaign
anderson
discovered
to
his
great
dismay
that
his
meals
were
not
only
irregular
in
the
matter
of
time
but
frequently
did
not
materialize
at
all
his
wife
and
daughters
neglected
him
completely
on
three
separate
occasions
after
waiting
until
nearly
eight
for
his
supper
he
strolled
disconsolately
over
to
the
equally
abandoned
home
of
alf
reesling
i
a
mighty
poor
cook
confessed
alf
on
the
first
occasion
a
hungry
harassed
look
in
his
eyes
but
anything
starvin
ai
it
it
shore
is
said
anderson
with
feeling
i
ai
seen
a
petticoat
around
my
house
since
nine
this
mornin
lamented
alf
upsetting
a
pan
of
milk
while
trying
to
get
a
plate
of
cold
ham
out
of
the
icebox
it
terrible
lem
me

alf
i
peel

leaning
dejectedly
against
the

said
anderson

on

a
terrible
end
anderson
worse
than
hangin
they
say
only
four
days
more
sighed
anderson
clipping
off
a
hunk
of
bologna
my
wife
says
if
i
hold
out
till
after
election
she
wo
never
leave
the
kitchen
long
as
she
lives
that
what
mine
says
sherman
was
only
half
right
war
may
be
hell
for
men
but
by
gosh
women
are
hell
for
war
an
that
what
it
is
war
anderson
war
to
the
hilt
every
woman
in
town
got
her
knife
out
an
my
god
how
they
slashin
each
other
there
wo
be
a
whole
woman
left
well
i
be
satisfied
with
half
a
one
mused
anderson
a
faraway
look
in
his
eyes
the
day
before
the
election
crow
played
her
trump
card
she
had
treasured
an
open
boast
made
years
before
by
the
disappointed
old
maid
who
now
opposed
her
minnie
before
attaining
years
of
discretion
and
still
smarting
under
the
failures
of
youth
had
spitefully
announced
that
she
was
a
spinster
from
choice
with
great
scorn
she
had
stated
while
sitting
on
crow
porch
that
she
would
die
an
old
maid
a
hundred
times
over
sooner
than
marry
any
one
in
tinkletown
and
she
added
the
best
proof
that
she
meant
what
she
said
was
the
fact
that
nearly
every
man
in
town
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
before
he
asked
any
one
else
the
news
spread
like
wildfire
the
instant
crow
released
it
crow
veracity
was
not
a
thing
to
be
questioned
when
the
returns
were
all
in
crow
was
found
to
have
received
votes
women
included
out
of
a
total
of
cast
miss
stitzenberg
held
the
german
vote
solid
including
seven
from
her
own
sex
who
could
afford
to
disregard
the
slander
because
they
had
been
safely
married
in
germany
long
before
coming
to
tinkletown
the
day
after
the
new
marshal
induction
into
office
anderson
appeared
with
his
star
glittering
so
brightly
that
it
dazzled
the
eye
his
shoes
were
polished
his
clothes
brushed
and
shocking
to
relate
his
trousers
creased
in
all
his
career
as
marshal
he
had
never
gone
to
such
extremes
as
this
he
was
however
not
in
a
happy
frame
of
mind
his
customary
aplomb
was
missing
well
of
all
the
began
alf
reesling
then
before
anderson
could
put
in
a
word
of
warning
he
shouted
to
the
group
in
front
of
store
hey
look
at
the
dude
anderson
very
red
in
the
face
declined
a
seat
on
a
soap
box
if
i
knowed
she
was
goin
to
act
like
this
i
a
voted
her
myself
he
said
rather
wanly
she
started
in
bossin
me
the
very
minute
she
got
my
place
as
marshal
she
laid
down
the
law
to
me
an
by
crickety
she
says
if
i
goin
to
be
her
deputy
i
got
to
look
like
this
every
day
look
at
them
shoes
and
these
pants
no
i
set
down
i
do
dare
risk
the
creases
my
daughter
susie
put
in
i
was
up
this
mornin
vicious
lucius
lucius
fry
lived
up
back
of
the
on
the
outskirts
of
tinkletown
he
had
a
wife
two
children
and
a
horse
and
buggy
for
a
great
many
years
he
had
led
a
quiet
peaceful
even
suppressed
existence
being
a
rather
smallish
bony
sort
of
man
with
a
large
adam
apple
and
bow
legs
he
was
an
object
of
considerable
scorn
not
only
to
his
acquaintances
but
to
his
wife
and
children
and
after
a
fashion
to
his
horse
the
latter
paid
absolutely
no
attention
to
him
when
he
said
or
when
he
applied
the
gad
she
neither
obeyed
the
command
nor
resented
the
chastisement
she
jogged
along
in
her
own
sweet
way
quite
as
if
he
were
nowhere
in
the
vicinity
his
wife
abused
him
and
his
children
ignored
him
no
one
it
would
appear
had
the
slightest
use
or
respect
for
lucius
fry
he
was
by
profession
a
the
installation
of
a
system
in
tinkletown
had
made
him
a
in
name
only
for
a
matter
of
five
or
six
years
barring
the
last
six
months
he
had
been
in
the
employ
of
his
wife
she
took
in
washing
and
it
was
his
job
to
collect
and
deliver
the
wash
three
times
a
week
in
return
for
this
he
received
board
and
lodging
and
an
occasional
visit
to
the
theatre
one
of
his
daughters
clerked
in
the
store
and
the
other
aged
twelve
was
errand
girl
to
miss
angie
nixon
the
fashionable
dressmaker
lucius
had
married
very
much
above
him
so
to
speak
that
is
to
say
his
wife
was
something
like
nine
or
ten
inches
the
taller
of
the
two
when
they
appeared
on
the
street
together
which
was
seldom
you
could
see
him
only
if
you
chanced
to
be
on
side
of
her
fry
was
nearly
six
feet
tall
and
very
wide
but
lucius
was
not
much
over
five
feet
two
he
had
a
receding
chin
that
tried
to
secrete
itself
behind
a
scant
crop
of
whiskers
cultivated
by
him
with
two
purposes
in
view
first
to
provide
shelter
for
his
shrinking
chin
and
second
to
avoid
the
arduous
and
unnecessary
task
of
shaving
illustration
they
appeared
on
the
street
roughly
speaking
lucius
was
a
shiftless
creature
it
had
long
been
the
consensus
of
opinion
freely
expressed
throughout
tinkletown
that
he
did
not
amount
to
a
tinker
dam
however
that
may
be
some
six
or
seven
months
prior
to
the
incidents
about
to
be
related
fry
himself
wrought
a
tremendous
and
unbelievable
change
in
the
foregoing
opinion
almost
in
the
wink
of
an
eyelash
he
passed
through
a
process
of
transmogrification
that
not
only
bewildered
him
but
caused
the
entire
community
to
sit
up
and
take
notice
of
him
it
all
came
about
in
the
oddest
sort
of
way
for
a
number
of
years
lucius
had
been
in
the
habit
of
currying
the
old
grey
mare
on
saturday
mornings
away
back
in
his
mind
lurked
an
hereditary
respect
for
the
sabbath
he
wanted
old
peggy
to
be
as
clean
as
possible
on
sunday
observing
the
same
principle
no
doubt
that
induces
a
great
many
people
to
take
a
bath
on
saturday
night
moreover
he
changed
the
bedding
in
her
stall
on
saturdays
employing
a
pitchfork
and
a
spade
for
a
number
of
years
peggy
had
put
up
with
these
attentions
responding
amiably
to
his
directions
such
as
get
over
dern
ye
or
whoa
back
stan
still
ca
ye
and
so
on
one
saturday
morning
in
the
spring
of
the
year
peggy
happened
to
be
peevish
the
cause
of
her
peevishness
was
a
swarm
of
intensely
active
flies
fry
was
accustomed
to
an
occasional
swish
of
her
tail
across
his
face
he
even
welcomed
it
for
the
flies
bothered
him
almost
as
much
as
they
did
peggy
on
mornings
when
he
felt
unusually
tired
he
was
rather
grateful
to
peggy
for
including
him
in
the
sweep
of
her
tail
but
on
this
particular
morning
the
exasperated
nag
planted
one
of
her
hoofs
on
fry
toes
while
he
was
engaged
in
brushing
out
the
kinks
in
her
mane
fry
happened
to
be
in
the
stable
at
the
time
seeing
if
the
hens
had
mislaid
anything
in
the
hay
she
was
astonished
by
the
roar
of
a
mighty
oath
followed
almost
instantly
by
a
thunderous
thump
on
the
anatomy
of
the
family
horse
a
second
or
two
later
head
came
in
for
a
resounding
whack
and
the
stream
of
profanity
increased
to
a
torrent
springing
to
her
feet
the
surprised
lady
cast
a
startled
glance
over
the
manger
into
the
stall
her
husband
had
old
peggy
backed
up
against
the
partition
and
was
preparing
to
deliver
a
third
blow
with
the
spade
when
she
called
out
to
him
stop
it
you
little
fool
fry
attention
was
diverted
peggy
was
spared
the
impending
blow
instead
the
outraged
hostler
charged
around
the
partition
through
a
narrow
passage
and
into
the
presence
of
his
wife
he
hobbled
painfully
inarticulate
sounds
issued
from
his
compressed
lips
he
gripped
the
so
tightly
that
cords
stood
out
on
his
rather
formidable
forearms
fry
got
as
far
as
you
ugly
little
and
then
as
he
bore
down
upon
her
turned
to
flee
he
altered
his
course
and
as
she
passed
him
on
the
way
to
the
open
door
the
flat
of
the
spade
landed
with
impelling
force
upon
the
broadest
part
of
her
person
the
sound
was
not
so
hollow
as
that
which
resulted
from
the
wallop
on
peggy
ribs
but
its
echo
was
a
great
deal
more
indeed
fry
howl
could
have
been
heard
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
she
passed
through
the
door
into
the
barnyard
on
the
wing
as
it
were
illustration
altered
his
course
and
as
she
passed
him
the
flat
of
his
spade
landed
with
impelling
lucius
blindly
took
another
swing
at
her
with
the
spade
as
she
made
her
exit
missing
her
by
several
feet
he
spun
completely
around
several
times
with
the
momentum
then
not
to
be
deprived
of
the
full
measure
of
triumph
he
hurled
the
implement
after
her
retreating
figure
rage
improved
the
accuracy
as
well
as
the
force
of
his
effort
the
spade
caught
fry
below
the
waistline
and
for
nearly
a
month
thereafter
she
was
in
the
habit
of
repairing
with
female
visitors
to
an
upstairs
bedroom
where
she
proudly
revealed
to
them
the
extensive
welt
produced
by
her
husband
belated
return
to
power
not
completely
satisfied
however
he
set
out
in
pursuit
of
her
principally
on
one
foot
but
with
a
swiftness
that
surprised
both
of
them
overtaking
her
near
the
barnyard
gate
he
pulled
up
suddenly
realizing
the
peril
of
being
too
precipitate
he
was
rushing
into
disaster
she
was
likely
to
turn
and
snatch
the
offensive
away
from
him
but
just
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
turning
to
run
the
other
way
she
flopped
down
on
her
knees
and
began
begging
him
for
god
sake
to
spare
her
her
eyes
were
tightly
closed
and
her
arms
were
raised
to
shield
her
face
seizing
this
fine
opportunity
he
edged
around
in
front
of
her
took
the
most
careful
deliberate
aim
and
forthwith
planted
his
fist
solidly
upon
her
unprotected
nose
he
had
always
wanted
to
do
it
but
never
before
had
the
opportunity
presented
itself
he
could
remember
when
he
had
caught
her
with
her
eyes
closed
before
she
invariably
stayed
awake
longer
than
he
did
at
night
telling
him
the
same
thing
she
had
told
him
the
night
before
and
in
the
morning
she
kicked
him
out
of
bed
before
his
eyes
were
open
now
here
was
the
golden
chance
it
might
never
occur
again
so
he
swung
with
all
his
might
and
main
fry
involuntarily
arose
from
her
knees
balanced
on
her
heels
for
a
second
or
two
and
then
sat
down
some
distance
away
with
the
same
heels
in
the
air
then
and
there
lucius
fry
ceased
to
be
a
person
of
no
consequence
two
or
three
neighbours
bent
on
rescuing
fry
got
no
nearer
than
the
fence
lucius
still
hopping
around
on
one
foot
gathered
up
a
stick
of
in
each
hand
and
let
fly
at
them
with
such
determination
and
precision
that
they
decided
to
let
him
go
ahead
and
murder
her
when
fry
daughters
hurried
into
the
house
a
short
time
afterward
they
found
their
mother
dressing
and
bandaging
fry
foot
and
chokingly
inquiring
if
she
was
hurting
him
between
sentences
she
applied
a
wet
towel
to
a
prodigious
unrecognizable
object
that
had
once
been
her
nose
juliet
the
elder
planted
herself
in
front
of
her
father
and
passionately
inquired
if
it
was
true
that
he
had
dared
to
strike
her
mother
lucius
with
rare
forethought
had
provided
himself
with
a
stick
of
before
entering
the
house
he
now
held
it
in
his
right
hand
he
was
not
going
to
take
any
chances
on
his
wife
treachery
he
was
ready
for
the
slightest
sign
of
an
uprising
without
answering
his
daughter
question
he
took
a
firm
grip
on
the
stick
and
started
to
arise
from
his
chair
upsetting
the
pail
of
water
that
his
wife
had
been
using
fry
screeched
do
hit
her
do
kill
her
lucius
for
god
shut
up
snarled
lucius

goin
to
belt

life

we
but
if
she
tries
to
well
you
see
what
happen
young
lady
go
an
get
a
mop
and
clean
up
that
water
d
hear
me
beat
it
for
the
lord
sake
juliet
do
what
he
tells
you
begged
fry
an
do
it
said
fry
having
so
suddenly
and
unintentionally
gained
the
upper
hand
in
his
household
he
was
determined
if
possible
to
retain
it
temporarily
at
least
he
had
his
wife
scared
almost
to
death
and
so
submissive
that
he
could
think
of
half
enough
indignities
to
heap
upon
her
no
matter
how
hard
he
tried
and
his
disdainful
daughters
spoke
in
hushed
voices
and
got
up
every
morning
to
start
the
kitchen
fire
and
carried
in
the
wood
and
waited
on
him
first
at
meals
and
allowed
him
to
read
before
any
one
else
claimed
it
and
fed
the
chickens
and
behaved
as
daughters
ought
to
behave
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
but
as
long
as
it
really
appeared
to
be
true
he
could
afford
to
relax
for
an
instant
he
went
about
with
a
perpetual
scowl
and
swore
from
morning
till
night
every
other
week
he
went
out
to
the
stable
and
after
closing
the
doors
proceeded
to
belabour
an
old
saddle
with
a
pitchfork
handle
the
sounds
reaching
the
back
porch
of
the
house
caused
fry
to
cover
her
ears
and
moan
poor
old
peggy
my
gracious
he
he
kill
her
occasionally
he
threw
a
or
a
hatchet
or
something
else
at
his
wife
but
his
aim
was
singularly
bad
for
try
as
he
would
he
did
not
appear
to
come
closer
than
five
or
six
feet
to
her
with
any
of
the
missiles
once
in
a
while
he
displayed
the
most
appalling
desire
to
destroy
everything
in
sight
on
such
occasions
he
smashed
chairs
broke
up
the
crockery
or
tramped
all
over
the
garments
that
fry
had
just
hung
out
to
dry
by
mistake
he
once
picked
up
a
hot
and
then
he
swore
in
earnest
his
dutiful
wife
wrapped
his
hand
up
in
soda
and
called
the
a
nasty
old
thing
in
a
very
short
time
everybody
in
tinkletown
was
talking
about
lucius
fry
some
one
lying
with
a
little
more
enterprise
than
the
rest
started
the
report
that
he
had
gone
to
boggs
city
the
county
seat
and
had
thrashed
a
bartender
who
refused
to
sell
him
a
drink
this
report
grew
until
lucius
was
credited
with
having
polished
off
a
whole
full
of
men
without
so
much
as
sustaining
a
scratch
himself
when
lucius
appeared
on
main
street
men
who
had
never
noticed
him
before
went
out
of
their
way
to
be
polite
and
friendly
women
who
pitied
fry
looked
at
him
with
interest
and
called
him
under
their
breath
a
big
ugly
brute
children
stopped
playing
and
ran
when
they
saw
lucius
fry
approaching
harry
squires
editor
of
in
reporting
one
of
most
violent
eruptions
alluded
to
him
as
vicious
lucius
the
name
clung
to
the
little
man
it
was
some
time
before
the
general
public
could
utter
it
with
confidence
haste
was
not
conducive
to
accuracy
rash
assuredness
frequently
turned
fry
into
vooshious
lishius
or
lishius
vooshious
or
even
ooshious
fry
in
course
of
time
grew
to
be
very
proud
of
her
master
the
despot
of
gully
she
revealed
her
pride
every
time
she
fell
in
with
acquaintances
on
the
way
to
church
in
reply
to
an
question
as
to
why
fry
did
not
go
to
church
with
her
any
longer
she
invariably
gave
the
supercilious
reply
that
nowadays
when
she
requested
her
husband
to
go
to
church
he
told
her
to
go
to
hell
instead
and
that
was
the
kind
of
a
man
she
respected
she
said
not
one
of
your
henpecked
cowards
who
go
to
church
because
they
are
more
afraid
of
their
wives
than
they
are
of
the
devil
and
while
the
mountainous
fry
was
no
longer
able
to
thrash
her
husband
she
still
inspired
fear
among
churchgoers
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
she
frequently
asserted
that
she
could
lick
any
man
in
tinkletown
except
her
husband
and
moreover
if
any
officer
of
the
law
ever
attempted
to
arrest
lucius
for
what
he
did
to
her
she
beat
his
head
off
that
what
she
do
the
marshal
of
tinkletown
anderson
crow
on
three
separate
occasions
organized
a
posse
to
go
out
to
gully
to
arrest
lucius
on
the
complaint
of
neighbours
who
said
they
could
stand
hearing
his
howls
any
longer
on
each
of
these
occasions
the
marshal
got
as
far
as
the
fry
front
gate
backed
by
eight
or
ten
of
the
huskiest
men
in
town
there
they
were
intercepted
by
fry
who
told
them
that
lucius
was
upstairs
peaceably
reloading
his
shotgun
or
oiling
up
his
trusty
old
as
the
case
may
have
been
and
she
believe
he
would
like
to
be
disturbed
is
he
an
quiet
stella
marshal
crow
would
ask
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
fry
would
reply
then
i
guess
we
better
leave
him
alone
the
marshal
would
say
adding
but
if
he
ever
goes
on
the
rampage
again
just
you
send
for
me
stella
an
i
come
as
quick
as
i
can
and
the
wife
of
vicious
lucius
would
say
do
forget
to
bring
the
undertaker
with
you
when
you
come
anderson
you
wo
need
a
doctor
at
times
lucius
would
feel
his
courage
slipping
at
such
times
he
would
go
out
to
the
barn
and
jostle
old
peggy
around
in
the
stall
hoping
against
hope
but
without
the
desired
result
she
simply
step
on
his
foot
one
bitter
cold
night
just
before
christmas
a
group
of
foremost
citizens
sat
around
the
big
stove
in
lamson
store
outside
the
wind
was
blowing
a
gale
it
howled
and
shrieked
around
the
corners
of
the
building
banged
forgotten
slammed
suspended
signboards
with
relentless
fury
and
afforded
unlimited
food
for
reflection
reminiscence
and
prophecy
it
was
long
past
customary
hour
for
closing
the
store
but
with
rare
tact
the
loungers
permitted
him
to
do
most
of
the
talking
it
was
nice
and
warm
in
the
vicinity
of
the
stove
and
there
were
tubs
of
dried
apples
and
prunes
and
a
sack
of
hazel
nuts
within
easy
reach
i
never
forget
the
christmas
i
spent
out
in
nebraska
lamson
was
saying
he
was
probably
the
most
travelled
man
in
town
every
time
he
told
a
story
he
went
a
little
farther
west
harry
squires
disconcerted
him
on
one
occasion
by
asking
in
his
most
ironic
manner
if
he
did
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
settle
in
california
when
he
got
there
and
lamson
after
thinking
it
over
stopped
his
subscription
to
yes
sir
that
was
a
terrible
winter
i
do
know
as
i
ever
told
you
about
it
but
we
had
to
drive
miles
in
sleighs
to
get
a
tree
on
christmas
eve
i
mean
a
christmas
tree
the
thermometer
registered
below
zero
and
he
was
interrupted
by
the
opening
of
the
door
an
icy
draft
swept
down
the
length
of
the
store
shut
that
door
roared
out
marshal
crow
but
the
door
remained
open
whereupon
every
one
craned
his
neck
to
see
who
was
responsible
there
was
no
one
in
sight
that
funny
said
newt

latched
and
returned
to
his
place
near
the
stove
marshal
crow
during
his
absence
had
bettered
his
position
he
had
exchanged
a
seat
on
a
box
of
soap
for
the
chair
newt
had
been
occupying
as
i
was
sayin
resumed
lamson
the
thermometer
registered
again
the
door
flew
open
banging
against
a
barrel
of
sugar
with
one
accord
the
assembled
group
arose
and
peered
at
the
open
door
well
now

to
the
door
pulling
his
up
about
his
throat
as
he
encountered
the
furious
blast
of
the
wind
at
the
top
of
the
steps
leading
up
to
the
porch
stood
a
small
figure
wrapped
in
a
shawl
the
light
from
within
shone
full
upon
the
figure
it
was
that
of
a
young
girl
and
she
was
looking
intently
up
the
street
well
of
all

the
girl
entered
the
store
and
some
one
closed
the
door
she
was
shivering
and
not
altogether
from
the
cold
her
glance
darted
hither
and
thither
as
if
in
quest
of
a
more
enduring
protection
than
that
exemplified
by
the
surrounding
her
roll
that
barrel
of
sugar
over
against
the
door
she
ordered
quickly

the

in
a
somewhat
bellicose

he
all
pa
is

his
best
clothes
every
day
and
has
taken
to
smoking
cigarettes
instead

pipe
when
he
outside
the
house
ma
was
counting
up
the
other
day
just
to
see
how
much
the
cigarettes
cost
her
and
but
that
was
what
i
started
to
tell

i
i

street
day
before
yesterday
with
a
woman
said
alf
reesling
fat
sort
of
a
woman
with
a
pink
hat
on
that
banks
she
never

interrupted
the
marshal
confine
yourself
to
the
evidence
in
this
case
an
nothing
else
well
as
i
was
saying
pa
was
peaceful
and
quiet
cracking
nuts
on
the
flatiron
he
got
hold
of
a
tough
and
it
would
crack
very
easy
so
he
had
to
hit
it
as
hard
as
he
could
somehow
he
missed
it
and
smack
went
the
hammer
right
on
his
thumb
my
goodness
you
ought
to
have
heard
him
yell
he
hopped
up
and
began
dancing
around
the
kitchen
sucking
his
thumb
and
trying
to
swear
with
his
mouth
full
ma
says
this
is
all
she
said
ma
says
you
hit
your
finger
lucius
pa
let
fly
the
hammer
it
did
miss
her
head
a
foot
then
he
fired
the
flatiron
at
her
feet
ma
screamed
and
started
to
run
the
back
stairs
pa
knocked
over
the
kitchen
table
trying
to
head
her
off
she
stumbled
and
fell
down
on
her
hands
and
knees
then
while
he
was
looking
for
something
to
beat
her
brains
out
with
she
got
up
and
run
into
the
pantry
and
locked
the
door
juliet
was
squealing
her
head
off
pa
picked
up
the
hammer
and
started
her
juliet
made
a
break
for
the
stairs
and
pa
let
go
with
the
hammer
he
missed
her
but
he
knocked
a
big
hole
in
the
ceiling
then
he
grabbed
the
off
the
stove
and
threw
it
at
the
cat
he
got
some
of
the
boiling
water
on
his
legs
i
guess
because
he
grabbed
in
his
hands
and
yelled
like
an
indian
he
swore
he
kill
everybody
in
the
house
so
i
beat
it
he
was
hunting
for
the
flatiron
and
the
hammer
and
i
was
outside
before
he
noticed
me
i
grabbed
this
old
red
tablecloth
as
i
went
out
and
put
it
around
me
when
i
saw
a
light
in
your
store
lamson

knowed
crow

up
i
came
now
what

mr

the
marshal
pondered
you
say

in
the
pantry
she
was
unless
he
busted
the
door
down
and
julie

she
probably

by
this
time
there
ai
any
lock
on
the
attic
door
well
seems
to
me
they
perfectly
safe
till
morning
julie

attic
window
if

me

the
girl
promptly
i

up
to
my
house
said
alf
reesling
she
can
crawl
in
with
my
daughter
queenie
that
out
of
the
question
said
harry
squires
arising
and
looking
around
for
his
overcoat
we
will
need
you
alf
the
marshal
is
going
to
organize
a
posse
and
go
up
to
gully
and
capture
vicious
lucius
dead
or
alive
before
he
half
an
hour
older
what
that
demanded
the
marshal
startled
you
heard
what
i
said
get
into
your
overcoats
and
goloshes
gentlemen
the
marshal
instructs
me
to
say
that
we
will
be
leaving
here
in
five
minutes
well
i
be
oozed
from
marshal
crow
lips
he
was
staring
quite
hopelessly
at
harry
squires
is
that
a
fact
mr
crow
inquired
harry
fixing
him
with
a
most
disconcerting
look
anderson
indulged
in
a
short
fit
of
coughing
yes
he
said
after
recovering
himself
it
a
fact
but
i
like
to
know
how
you
got
onto
it
i
am
a
mental
telegrapher
crow
said
the
reporter
carefully
placing
a
hat
upon
reesling
head
there
your
hat
alf
now
be
sure
and
pick
out
a
good
coat
the
marshal
posse
eventually
resolved
itself
into
a
party
of
two
anderson
crow
and
harry
squires
elmer
pratt
remembered
that
his
youngest
child
had
the
croup
and
he
could
leave
her
situate
jones
complained
of
a
sudden
and
violent
attack
of
lumbago
newt
spratt
loudly
demanded
the
flaxseed
his
wife
had
asked
him
to
bring
home
so
that
she
could
make
a
poultice
for
a
terrible
toothache
she
was
enjoying
that
evening
alf
reesling
refused
to
desert
poor
little
elfie
and
two
other
gentlemen
succeeded
in
sneaking
out
the
back
way
while
the
marshal
view
was
obstructed
by
the
aforesaid
slackers
storekeeper
lamson
had
a
perfectly
sound
excuse
he
was
a
pacifist
however
he
was
willing
to
lend
his
revolver
to
the
marshal
and
a
pair
of
brass
knucks
to
harry
squires
approaching
gully
the
two
adventurers
observed
shadowy
forms
moving
about
in
the
darkness
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
they
paused
mostly
women
i
should
say
remarked
the
marshal
probably
hoping
that
lucius
is
a
widower
by
this
time
said
the
reporter
so
they
send
flowers
an
victuals
to
him
all
the
time
he
in
jail
said
anderson
you
go
down
an
talk
to
harry
while
i
sneak
around
the
back
way
and
reconnoitre
that
a
good
idea
said
harry
i
just
rush
in
through
the
front
door
and
he
make
a
break
to
escape
by
the
rear
so
you
be
right
there
to
head
him
off
come
to
think
of
it
said
anderson
hastily
maybe
we
better
see
if
he
out
in
the
front
yard
first
come
on
eight
or
ten
people
were
congregated
in
front
of
the
fry
house
conversing
in
a
hushed
excited
manner
the
marshal
and
his
companion
bore
down
upon
them
as
the
former
had
remarked
they
were
mostly
women
there
was
but
one
man
in
the
group
he
turned
out
to
be
no
other
than
vicious
lucius
himself

vicious

in
a
hurried
manner

was
wearing
an
overcoat
that
came
down
to
his
heels
and
a
derby
hat
that
rested
rather
firmly
upon

horror

corner
of
the
house
where

harry
squires
grasped
his
arm
and
led
him
toward
the
kitchen
door
fry
herself
admitted
them
she
looked
most
formidable
did
my
daughter
elfaretta
ask
you
to
come
here
and
interfere
with
my
private
affairs
anderson
crow
she
demanded
i
am
not
supposed
to
answer
questions
like
that
fry
said
anderson
with
dignity
i
am
pleased
to
inform
you
however
that
i
have
succeeded
in
arrestin
your
husband
an
i
intend
to
see
to
it
that
he
is
locked
up
fer
oh
my
goodness
groaned
the
gigantic
lady
dropping
suddenly
into
a
chair
and
lowering
her
face
into
her
apron
the
marshal
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
you
have
got
to
release
vicious
lucius
at
once
said
harry
squires
sternly
we
ca
afford
to
wreck
this
poor
little
woman
life
little
what
that
you
said
stammered
the
marshal
still
gazing
at
the
ponderous
bulk
in
the
chair
you
heard
what
i
said
wreck
this
poor
but
proud
lady
life
speak
up
fry
tell
the
good
marshal
all
about
it
whereupon
the
woebegone
fry
lifted
her
head
and
her
voice
in
lamentation
i
knew
it
could
last
i
might
knowed
something
would
turn
up
to
spoil
it
it
was
too
much
to
expect
oh
if
you
only
would
lock
him
up
crow
what
will
people
say
when
they
find
out
you
was
able
to
arrest
him
without
a
gang
o
men
to
help
you
oh
oh
oh
squires
interposed
a
suggestion
just
as
she
was
on
the
verge
of
sobs
i
dare
say
we
could
stage
a
perfectly
realistic
struggle
between
fry
and
crow
fry
could
trip
crow
up
all
in
play
you
know
and
then
i
could
rush
in
and
grab
fry
from
behind
while
he
was
letting
on
as
though
he
was
kicking
crow
in
the
face
the
spectators
would
i
wo
be
a
party
to
any
such
monkey
business
exclaimed
the
marshal
in
some
heat
what
do
you
take
me
for
if
i
arrest
lucius
fry
jest
simply
pick
him
up
by
the
and
that
just
it
cried
fry
he
would
fight
back
and
how
would
i
feel
if
you
carried
him
off
to
jail
as
if
he
was
a
and
i
was
beginning
to
feel
so
proud
and
happy
i
was
getting
so
i
could
look
those
cats
in
the
face
all
because
my
husband
was
the
best
little
daredevil
in
the
gully
they
used
to
pity
me
now
they
are
so
jealous
of
me
they
do
know
what
to
do
they
give
anything
if
they
had
a
husband
like
lucius
little
as
he
is
my
how
they
envy
me
and
how
i
have
been
looking
down
on
all
of
the
last
six
months
and
here
you
arrest
him
as
easy
as
if
he
was
a
little
girl
when
i
been
telling
everybody
there
was
anybody
living
that
could
take
my
man
to
jail
oh
i
i
wish
i
never
been
born
anderson
crow
was
puzzled
he
pulled
at
his
whiskers
in
the
most
helpless
way
and
stared
but
but
ai
you
afraid
to
live
with
him
he
mumbled
ai
you
afraid
he
lick
you
to
death
sometime
when
he
in
one
of
he
could
lick
me
if
i
was
chloroformed
blurted
out
fry
arising
suddenly
she
bared
a
huge
right
arm
see
that
well
that
as
big
as
his
leg
do
you
ever
get
it
in
your
head
that
i
ca
lick
lucius
fry
that
ai
the
point
i
can
do
it
but
i
would
do
it
for
anything
on
earth
i
want
to
be
proud
of
him
and
i
want
these
other
women
to
feel
sorry
for
me
because
i
got
a
for
a
husband
and
not
a
rabbit
where
is
he
mr
crow
he
out
there
waitin
fer
me
to
take
him
to
jail
that
is
he
he
wait
course
if
you
wo
make
any
affidavit
him
i
i
guess
there
no
sense
in
me
lockin
him
up
i
was
doin
it
as
a
er
as
a
sort
of
favour
to
him
anyhow
he
seemed
to
be
afraid
he
kill
some
of
them
women
that
hang
around
him
i
just
thought
he
act
that
way
i
wo
make
any
charge
against
him
i
want
him
to
stay
just
the
way
he
is
a
fine
upstanding
brutal
sort
of
feller
you
go
out
there
an
tell
him
to
come
in
here
i
want
to
go
down
on
my
knees
again
and
forgive
him
the
marshal
hesitated
he
was
between
two
fires
he
could
very
well
oblige
of
them
lucius
unquestionably
was
eager
to
go
to
jail
for
reasons
of
his
own
and
fry
was
just
as
eager
that
he
should
remain
at
large
the
marshal
scratched
his
head
i
feel
kinder
sorry
fer
him
he
mused
like
as
not
one
of
them
women
will
git
so
foolish
over
him
that
her
husband
will
take
it
into
his
head
to
get
a
divorce
an
he
paused
in
confusion
go
on

her

slapped
him
violently
on
the
back
that
just
what
i
want
she
cried
eagerly
i
be
the
proudest
woman
in
tinkletown
the
marshal
stared
harry
squires
covered
his
mouth
with
his
hand
well
of
all
the
gosh
his
ejaculation
was
cut
short
by
the
opening
of
the
kitchen
door
lucius
stood
outlined
in
the
aperture
he
was
clapping
his
arms
about
his
body
and
his
teeth
were
chattering
the
voluminous
sleeves
flapped
like
great
limp
wings
say
he
whined
i
ca
wait
out
there
all
night
in
this
kinder
weather
if
i
got
to
go
to

i
want
to

said
marshall
crow
uncomfortably
i
got
to
disperse
that
crowd
o
women
out
there
in
the
street
good
night
lucius
night
fry
if
you
ever
need
me
all
yer
got
to
do
is
just
send
word
lucius
followed
him
to
the
door
and
would
have
gone
out
into
the
night
with
him
if
the
marshal
had
not
deliberately
pushed
him
back
you
you
ai
goin
to
desert
me
are
you
whispered
lucius
fiercely
the
marshal
leaned
over
and
whispered
to
lucius
if
all
the
other
men
in
this
here
town
had
as
soft
a
snap
as
got
lucius
fry
they
hate
to
die
ever
because
they
know
they
never
git
back
into
heaven
the
veiled
lady
and
the
shadow
a
veiled
lady
is
not
in
ordinary
circumstances
an
object
of
concern
to
anybody
circumstances
however
are
sometimes
so
extraordinary
that
a
veiled
lady
becomes
an
object
of
concern
to
everybody
if
the
novelists
are
to
be
credited
an
abundantly
veiled
lady
is
more
than
a
source
of
interest
she
is
the
vital
central
figure
in
a
mystery
that
continues
from
week
to
week
or
month
to
month
as
the
case
may
be
until
the
last
chapter
is
reached
and
she
turns
out
to
be
the
person
you
thought
she
was
all
the
time
now
the
village
of
tinkletown
is
a
somnolent
sort
of
place
in
which
veils
are
worn
by
old
ladies
who
wish
to
enjoy
a
pleasant
snooze
during
the
sermon
without
being
caught
in
the
act
that
any
one
should
wear
a
veil
with
the
same
regularity
and
the
same
purpose
that
she
wears
the
dress
which
renders
the
remainder
of
her
person
invisible
is
a
circumstance
calculated
to
excite
the
curiosity
of
even
the
most
indifferent
observers
in
the
village
of
tinkletown
so
when
the
news
travelled
up
and
down
main
street
and
off
into
the
and
far
out
beyond
three
oaks
cemetery
to
the
new
division
known
as
oak
park
wherein
reside
four
lonely
pioneer
families
that
the
lady
who
rented
nixon
house
for
the
month
of
september
was
in
a
perpetual
state
of
obscurity
to
quote
harry
squires
the
reporter
the
residents
of
tinkletown
admitted
that
they
did
know
what
to
make
of
it
the
nixon
cottage
was
a
quaint
place
on
the
side
of
battle
hill
looking
down
upon
the
maples
of
sickle
street
the
grounds
were
rather
spacious
and
the
house
stood
well
back
from
the
street
establishing
an
aloofness
that
had
never
been
noticed
before
a
low
stone
wall
guarded
the
lawn
and
and
there
was
an
iron
gate
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
the
front
porch
was
partly
screened
by
dutchman
pipe
vines
with
the
advent
of
the
tenant
smart
japanese
made
their
appearance
and
from
that
day
on
no
prying
eye
no
matter
how
it
may
have
been
could
accomplish
anything
like
a
satisfactory
visit
to
the
regions
beyond
nixon
usually
rented
her
house
for
the
summer
months
the
summer
of
had
proved
an
unprofitable
season
for
her
it
was
and
the
people
who
lived
in
the
cities
proved
unduly
reluctant
to
venture
far
from
their
bases
of
supplies
consequently
nixon
and
her
daughter
angie
remained
in
occupancy
more
heartsick
than
ever
over
the
horrors
of
war
just
as
they
were
about
to
give
up
hope
the
unexpected
happened
joseph
singer
the
agent
offices
in
the
lamson
block
appeared
bright
and
early
one
morning
to
inquire
if
the
cottage
could
be
had
for
the
month
of
september
and
part
of
october
you
may
ask
any
price
you
like
abbie
he
said
the
letter
i
received
this
morning
was
written
on
the
paper
of
the
plaza
hotel
in
new
york
anybody
who
can
afford
to
put
up
at
the
plaza
which
is
right
on
central
park
and
also
on
fifth
avenue
ai
going
to
haggle
about
prices
the
party
wants
a
bathroom
with
hot
and
cold
water
and
electric
lights
well
you
got
all
these
improvements
and
i
got
to
have
references
said
nixon
firmly
i
guess
if
the
plaza
is
willing
to
rent
a
room
to
a
party
there
ought
to
be
any
question
as
to
the
respectability
of
the
said
party
said
singer
they
mighty
particular
in
them
new
york
hotels
well
you
write
and
tell
the
party
i
am
requested
to
telegraph
abbie
said
he
the
party
wants
to
know
right
away
as
the
result
of
this
conversation
and
a
subsequent
exchange
of
telegrams
the
party
arrived
in
tinkletown
on
the
first
day
of
september
singer
contentions
were
justified
by
the
manner
in
which
the
new
tenant
descended
upon
the
village
she
came
in
a
limousine
with
a
chauffeur
a
french
maid
a
french
poodle
and
what
all
of
the
ladies
in
tinkletown
unhesitatingly
described
as
a
french
gown
à
la
mode
miss
angie
nixon
who
had
never
been
nearer
to
paris
than
brattleboro
vermont
said
to
her
customers
that
from
what
she
had
seen
of
the
new
tenant
outfit
she
was
undoubtedly
from
the
tooleries
miss
angie
was
the
leading
dressmaker
of
tinkletown
if
she
had
said
the
lady
was
from
somaliland
the
statement
would
have
gone
unchallenged
the
same
day
a
man
cook
and
a
hired
girl
arrived
from
boggs
city
having
come
up
by
rail
from
new
york
the
tenant
was
a
tall
slender
lady
there
could
be
no
division
of
opinion
as
to
that
as
to
whether
she
was
young
or
only
no
one
was
in
a
position
to
asseverate
as
a
matter
of
fact
observers
would
have
been
justified
in
wondering
whether
she
was
black
or
white
she
was
never
abroad
without
the
thick
voluminous
veil
and
her
hands
were
never
ungloved
nixon
and
angie
described
her
voice
as
refined
and
elegant
and
she
spoke
english
as
well
as
anybody
not
excepting
professor
rank
of
the
high
school
by
the
end
of
her
first
week
in
the
nixon
cottage
there
was
a
person
in
tinkletown
exclusive
of
small
babies
who
had
not
advanced
a
theory
concerning
smith
the
new
tenant
on
one
point
all
agreed
she
was
the
most
person
ever
seen
in
tinkletown
she
resolutely
avoided
all
contact
with
her
neighbours
on
several
occasions
polite
and
cordial
citizens
had
bowed
and
mumbled
to
her
as
she
passed
in
the
automobile
but
there
is
no
record
of
a
single
instance
in
which
she
paid
the
slightest
heed
to
these
civilities
all
of
her
marketing
was
done
by
the
man
cook
and
while
he
was
able
to
speak
english
quite
fluently
when
objecting
to
the
quality
the
quantity
and
the
price
of
everything
he
was
singularly
unable
to
carry
on
a
conversation
in
that
language
when
invited
to
do
so
by
friendly
clerks
or
proprietors
as
for
the
french
chauffeur
his
knowledge
of
english
appeared
to
be
limited
to
an
explosive
sort
of
profanity
lum
gillespie
declared
on
the
third
day
after
smith
car
first
came
to
his
garage
for
live
storage
that
that
feller
francose
knew
more
english
than
all
the
irishmen
in
the
world
the
veiled
lady
did
a
good
many
surprising
things
in
the
first
place
she
had
been
in
the
nixon
cottage
not
more
than
an
hour
when
she
ordered
the
telephone
taken
out
not
merely
discontinued
but
taken
out
she
gave
no
reason
and
satisfied
the
by
making
the
local
manager
a
present
of
ten
dollars
she
kept
all
of
the
green
open
during
the
day
letting
the
sunshine
into
the
rooms
to
give
the
carpets
the
first
surprise
they
had
had
in
years
and
at
night
she
sat
out
on
the
porch
with
a
until
an
hour
when
many
of
the
residents
of
tinkletown
were
looking
out
of
their
windows
to
see
what
sort
of
a
day
it
was
going
to
be
she
paid
cash
for
everything
and
always
with
bright
crisp
banknotes
fresh
from
the
mint
she
slept
till
noon
she
went
out
every
afternoon
about
four
rain
or
shine
for
long
in
the
country
the
queerest
thing
about
her
was
that
she
never
went
near
the
movies
nearly
every
afternoon
directly
after
luncheon
they
called
it
dinner
in
tinkletown
she
appeared
in
the
back
yard
and
put
her
extraordinarily
barbered
dog
through
a
raft
of
tricks
always
paused
to
watch
the
performance
she
had
him
walking
first
on
his
hind
legs
then
on
his
front
legs
then
he
was
catching
a
which
she
tossed
every
which
way
just
as
a
woman
would
said
alf
reesling
and
when
he
catching
the
ball
he
was
turning
somersaults
or
waltzing
to
the
tune
she
whistled
or
playing
dead
the
poodle
name
was
snooks
the
venerable
town
marshal
anderson
crow
sat
in
front
of
store
one
hot
evening
about
a
week
after
the
advent
of
the
mystery
he
was
the
center
of
a
thoughtful
speculative
group
of
gentlemen
representing
the
first
families
of
tinkletown
among
those
present
were

and
two

note
the
shades
of
night

just
descended
some
of
the
gentlemen
had
already
yawned
three
or
four
times
there
ai
no
law
against
wearin
a
veil
said
the
marshal
reaching
out
just
in
time
to
pluck
a
nice
red
apple
before
lamson
clerk
could
make
up
his
mind
to
do
what
he
had
come
out
of
the
store
expressly
to
do
that
is
to
carry
inside
for
the
night
the
bushel
basket
containing
among
other
things
a
plainly
printed
placard
informing
the
public
that
no

apple
critically
for
a
moment
looking
for
a
suitable
place
to
begin
then
with
his
mouth
full
he
went
on
the
only
thing
i
got
her
is
that
she
settin
a
new
style
in
tinkletown
in
the
last
days
i
seen
one
of
our
fair
sex
lookin
at
veils
in
the
five
an
ten
cent
store
and
this
afternoon
i
saw
somebody
i
was
sure
was
sue
becker
walkin
up
maple
street
with
her
head
wrapped
up
in
something
as
green
as
grass
could
see
her
face
to
save
my
soul
but
i
recognized
her
feet
my
daughter
caroline
was
fixin
herself
up
before
the
last
night
seein
how
she
look
in
a
veil
she
said
it
wo
be
long
before
we
wo
any
of
us
be
able
to
recognize
our
own
wives
an
daughters
when
we
meet
on
the
street
my
girl
queenie
got
a
new
pink
one
said
alf
reesling
she
made
it
out
of
some
sort
of
stuff
she
wore
over
her
graduatin
dress
three
years
ago
maybe
she
got
a
bad
complexion
ventured
jones
who
my
girl
queenie
not
on
your
began
alf
bristling
i
mean
the
woman
up
at
nixon
explained
jones
hastily
harry
squires
had
taken
no
part
in
the
conversation
up
to
this
juncture
he
had
been
ruminating
his
inevitable
you
might
almost
say
his
indefatigable
pipe
had
gone
out
four
or
five
times
say
anderson
he
broke
in
abruptly
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
there
might
be
something
back
of
it
that
ought
to
be
investigated
the
flare
of
the
match
he
was
holding
over
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
revealed
an
eager
twinkle
in
his
eyes
there
you
go
talkin
foolishness
again
said
anderson
i
guess
there
ai
anything
back
of
it
a
face
an
she
got
a
right
to
have
a
face
ai
she
i
mean
the
for
wearing
a
veil
that
completely
obscures
her
face
the
they
say
she
never
takes
it
off
even
in
the
house
who
told
you
that
angie
nixon
she
says
she
believes
she
sleeps
in
it
how
does
she
deduce
that
demanded
anderson
idly
fingering
the
badge
of
the
new
york
detective
association
which
for
obvious
reasons
it
being
a
very
hot
night
was
attached
to
his
suspenders
she
deduced
it
through
a
keyhole
replied
squires
angie
was
up
at
the
cottage
last
night
to
get
something
she
had
left
in
an
upstairs
hall
closet
she
just
happened
to
stoop
over
to
pick
up
something
on
the
floor
right
in
front
of
smith
door
the
strangest
thing
occurred
she
said
it
could
occur
again
in
a
thousand
years
not
even
if
she
tried
to
do
it
her
left
ear
happened
to
stop
not
more
than
half
an
inch
from
the
keyhole
she
just
could
help
hearing
what
smith
said
to
her
maid
angie
says
she
said
plain
as
anything
could
blame
me
for
sitting
up
all
night
if
you
had
to
sleep
in
a
thing
like
this
she
did
hear
anything
more
because
she
hates
eavesdropping
besides
she
thought
she
heard
the
maid
walking
toward
the
door
now
what
do
you
make
of
that
mr
hawkshaw
if
you
do
stop
callin
me
hawkshaw
i
i
apologize
an
acute
case
of
lapsus
lingua
crow
but
was
that
remark
significant
i
am
a
friend
of
nixon
an
i
must
decline
to
criticize
her
beds
said
crow
rather
loftily
i
ai
ever
slept
in
one
of
but
i
do
it
any
time
before
i
set
up
all
night
granting
that
the
bed
was
all
right
then
is
it
pretty
clear
that
she
was
referring
to
something
else
the
veil
for
instance
sounds
reasonable
said
newt
spratt
and
then
after
due
reflection
mighty
reasonable
i
hate
to
sleep
in
a
veil
said
alf
reesling
it
bad
enough
to
try
to
sleep
with
a
mustard
poultice
on
your
jaw
like
i
did
last
winter
when
i
had
that
bad
toothache
doc
ellis
says
he
never
pulled
a
bigger
er
a
stubborner
tooth
in
all
his
experience
than
i
think
you
ought
to
investigate
the
veiled
lady
of
nixon
cottage
said
harry
squires
lowering
his
voice
and
glancing
over
his
shoulder
you
ca
tell
what
she
up
to
anderson
it
would
surprise
me
if
she
a
woman
with
a
past
she
may
be
using
that
veil
as
a
disguise
what
more
there
may
be
a
price
on
her
head
the
country
is
full
of
these
female
spies
working
tooth
and
nail
for
germany
suppose
she
should
turn
out
to
be
that
society
woman
the
new
york
papers
say
the
secret
service
men
are
chasing
all
over
the
country
and
ca
find
the
baroness
von
slipernitz
what
fer
kind
of
a
dog
is
that
you
got
ed
inquired
crow
calmly
ignoring
the
suggestion
higgins
new
dog
was
enjoying
a
short
nap
in
the
middle
of
the
sidewalk
after
an
apparently
fatiguing
effort
to
dislodge
something
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
left
ear
well
began
ed
eyeing
the
dog
doubtfully
all
i
know
about
him
is
that
he
a
black
dog
my
wife
has
been
sizin
him
up
for
a
day
or
two
figgerin
on
having
him
clipped
here
and
there
to
see
if
he
ca
be
made
to
look
as
respectable
as
that
dog
of
smith
hetty
adams
has
clipped
that
newfoundland
dog
of
hers
changed
him
something
terrible
when
i
come
across
them
on
the
street
today
i
declare
i
only
recognized
half
of
him
an
i
would
have
recognized
that
much
if
he
wagged
it
at
me
it
beats
all
what
women
will
do
to
keep
up
with
the
styles
i
seen
him
today
said
spratt
an
i
never
in
all
my
life
see
a
dog
that
looked
so
mortified
i
says
to
hetty
says
i
the
name
heaven
hetty
says
i
you
been
doin
to
shep
an
she
says
thank
you
newt
spratt
not
to
call
my
dog
shep
his
name
is
edgar
so
i
says
to
shep
here
edgar
that
a
good
dog
an
he
never
moved
then
i
says
shep
an
he
almost
jumped
out
of
his
hide
he
was
so
happy
to
find
somebody
that
knowed
who
he
was
your
granny
says
i
to
hetty
the
use
of
ruinin
a
good
dog
by
calling
him
edgar
an
hetty
says
here
edgar
come
here
i
say
but
edgar
he
never
paid
any
attention
to
her
he
just
kep
on
tryin
to
lick
my
hand
an
so
she
hit
him
a
clip
with
her
parysol
says

say

i

just
to
prove

to
her

an

so
shep
old
sport
an
what
do
you
think
that
poor
old
dog
done
he
got
right
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
tried
to
kiss
me
no
wonder
she
wants
to
call
him
edgar
said
harry
squires
just
the
kind
of
thing
an
edgar
sort
of
dog
would
do
i
was
just
going
to
say
said
crow
twisting
his
whiskers
reflectively
that
maybe
she
does
it
because
she
had
smallpox
or
been
terribly
scalded
or
is
or
something
like
that
squires
inwardly
rejoiced
he
knew
that
the
seed
had
been
planted
in
the
marshal
fertile
brain
that
it
would
thrive
in
the
night
and
sprout
on
the
morrow
he
saw
delectable
operations
ahead
he
was
fond
of
the
old
man
but
nothing
afforded
him
greater
entertainment
than
the
futile
but
vainglorious
efforts
of
anderson
crow
to
achieve
renown
as
a
detective
the
reporter
was
a
constant
thorn
in
the
side
of
crow
who
both
loved
and
feared
him
the
seldom
appeared
without
some
sarcastic
advice
to
the
marshal
of
tinkletown
but
an
adjoining
column
invariably
contained
something
of
a
complimentary
character
the
one
so
adroitly
offsetting
the
other
that
crow
never
knew
whether
he
was
afoot
or
horseback
to
quote
him
in
his
perplexity
harry
squires
had
worked
on
a
new
york
morning
paper
in
his
early
days
his
health
failing
him
he
was
compelled
to
abandon
what
might
have
become
a
really
brilliant
career
as
a
journalist
lean
sick
and
disheartened
he
came
to
bramble
county
to
spend
the
winter
with
an
old
aunt
who
lived
among
the
hills
above
the
village
of
tinkletown
that
was
twenty
years
ago
for
nineteen
years
he
had
filled
the
post
of
city
editor
on
the
he
always
maintained
that
the
most
excruciating
thing
he
had
ever
written
was
the
line
at
the
top
of
the
first
column
of
the
editorial
page
which
said
city
editor
harry
sylvester
squires
nothing
he
claimed
could
be
more
provocative
of
hilarity
than
that
in
his
capacity
as
city
editor
he
wrote
advertisements
personals
editorials
locals
and
practically
everything
else
in
the
paper
except
the
poetry
sent
in
by
miss
sue
becker
he
even
wrote
the
cable
and
telegraph
matter
always
ascribing
it
to
a
special
correspondent
of
the
in
addition
to
all
this
he
the
forms
corrected
proof
wrote
heads
stood
over
the
boy
who
ran
the
press
and
stood
over
him
when
he
was
running
the
press
took
all
the
blame
and
none
of
the
credit
for
things
that
appeared
in
the
paper
and
once
a
week
accepted
currency
to
the
amount
of
fifteen
dollars
as
an
honorarium
regarding
himself
as
permanently
buried
in
this
spot
on
the
earth
surface
he
had
the
grim
humour
to
write
his
own
obituary
and
publish
it
in
the
columns
of
the
he
began
it
by
saying
that
he
was
going
to
tell
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
about
the
deceased
he
had
written
hundreds
of
obituaries
during
his
career
as
city
editor
he
said
and
not
once
before
had
he
been
at
liberty
to
tell
the
truth
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
had
no
relations
to
stop
their
subscriptions
to
the
paper
he
felt
that
for
once
in
his
life
he
could
take
advantage
of
an
opportunity
to
write
exactly
as
he
felt
about
the
deceased
he
left
out
such
phrases
as
highly
esteemed
citizen
nobility
of
character
loss
to
the
community
soul
of
integrity
and
other
stock
expressions
at
the
end
he
begged
to
inform
his
friends
that
flowers
might
be
deposited
at
the
office
or
at
his
room
in
as
he
was
buried
in
both
places
buttonhole
bouquets
could
be
pinned
upon
him
any
day
by
simply
stopping
his
customary
funeral
procession
about
town
such
attentions
should
always
be
accompanied
by
gentle
words
or
exclamations
of
satisfaction
as
for
example
how
natural
you
look
or
you
owed
me
ten
dollars
but
i
forgive
you
or
it
a
pity
your
friends
allowed
you
to
to
be
laid
away
in
a
suit
of
clothes
like
that
or
i
do
believe
half
the
things
people
said
about
you
or
it
a
perfect
shame
you
do
feel
like
resting
in
peace
or
did
you
leave
anything
worth
mentioning
he
also
suggested
that
he
would
rest
much
easier
in
his
grave
if
a
slight
increase
in
salary
attended
the
obsequies
from
this
it
may
be
gathered
that
harry
squires
was
a
man
who
made
the
most
out
of
a
very
ordinary
situation
marshal
crow
suggestion
met
with
instant
response
on
the
other
hand
anderson
the
lady
may
be
as
beautiful
as
the
fabulous
houri
and
as
devilish
as
delilah
i
do
want
to
take
any
steps
in
the
matter
without
giving
you
your
chance
he
spoke
darkly
crow
pricked
up
his
ears
what
do
you
mean
by
that
as
a
newspaper
man
i
am
determined
to
clear
up
the
mystery
of
the
veiled
lady
if
you
persist
in
sitting
around
twiddling
your
thumbs
and
looking
like
a
primeval
goat
i
shall
send
to
new
york
and
engage
a
detective
to
work
on
the
case
exclusively
for
the
the
is
enterprising
we
intend
to
give
our
subscribers
the
news
no
matter
what
it
costs
if
you
the
marshal
swallowed
the
bait
hook
and
all
he
arose
from
his
chair
and
faced
squires
i
thank
you
harry
squires
to
keep
out
of
this
i
did
mean
to
say
a
word
about
it
to
you
or
anybody
else
until
i
had
gone
a
little
further
with
my
investigations
but
now
i
got
to
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
i
been
working
day
and
night
on
her
case
ever
since
she
came
to
town
never
mind
newt
do
ask
me
announce
the
result
of
my
investigations
at
the
proper
time
an
not
a
minute
sooner
now
i
guess
i
be
moseyin
along
it
gettin
purty
late
an
i
got
a
lot
of
work
to
do
before
midnight
he
started
down
the
steps
harry
squires
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
scratched
a
match
on
the
leg
of
his
trousers
by
the
time
he
raised
the
lighted
match
to
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
the
smile
had
left
his
lips
an
uneventful
week
passed
the
veiled
lady
made
her
daily
excursions
in
the
big
car
pursued
her
now
domestic
habits
retained
her
offensive
aloofness
played
games
with
the
astounding
snooks
suffered
no
ill
effects
whatsoever
from
the
inimical
glares
of
the
natives
and
above
all
she
continued
to
set
the
fashions
in
tinkletown
illustration
veiled
lady
made
her
daily
excursions
in
the
big
crow
stalked
the
streets
early
and
late
he
lurked
behind
the
corners
of
buildings
he
peered
sharply
from
the
of
telephone
poles
as
the
big
limousine
swept
haughtily
by
he
patrolled
the
nixon
neighbourhood
by
day
and
haunted
it
by
night
on
occasion
he
might
have
been
observed
in
the
act
of
scrutinizing
the
tracks
of
the
automobile
over
recently
sprinkled
streets
one
evening
just
after
dusk
after
a
sharp
encounter
with
harry
squires
who
bluntly
accused
him
of
loafing
on
the
job
he
sauntered
past
the
nixon
cottage
his
soul
was
full
of
bitterness
he
was
baffled
harry
squires
was
right
he
had
accomplished
nothing
and
what
was
worse
he
was
likely
to
accomplish
anything
he
sauntered
back
casting
furtive
glances
into
the
spacious
and
concluded
to
ease
his
restless
legs
by
leaning
against
a
tree
and
crossing
them
in
an
attitude
of
profound
nonchalance
the
tree
happened
to
be
almost
directly
in
front
of
the
nixon
gate
not
to
seem
actually
employed
in
shadowing
the
house
he
decided
to
pose
with
his
back
to
the
premises
facing
down
the
street
twisting
his
whiskers
in
a
most
pensive
manner
suddenly
a
low
musical
voice
said
good
evening
crow
looked
up
into
the
thick
foliage
of
the
elm
then
to
the
right
and
left
and
finally
in
the
direction
of
the
cottage
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
after
a
sudden
twist
of
the
neck
that
caused
him
to
wonder
whether
he
had
sprained
it
the
veiled
lady
was
standing
at
the
gate
in
the
gathering
darkness
her
figure
seemed
abnormally
tall
the
marshal
hastily
faced
about
and
stared
hard
at
the
mystery
evening
he
said
somewhat
uncertainly
then
he
lifted
his
hat
a
couple
of
inches
from
his
head
and
replaced
it
at
an
entirely
new
angle
pulling
the
rim
down
so
far
over
the
left
eye
that
the
right
eye
alone
was
visible
this
shift
of
the
hat
instantly
transformed
him
into
a
figure
of
speech
he
became
as
cunning
as
a
fox
people
in
tinkletown
had
come
to
recognize
this
as
an
unfailing
symptom
of
shrewdness
on
his
part
he
always
wore
his
hat
like
that
when
he
was
deep
in
the
process
of
ferreting
something
out
have
i
the
honour
of
addressing
anderson
crow
inquired
the
lady
you
have
said
he
succinctly
field
marshal
crow
or
is
it
town
marshal
i
am
quite
ignorant
about
titles
that
the
name
i
go
by
your
name
is
very
familiar
to
me
are
you
in
any
way
related
to
the
great
detective
this
was
unexpected
tribute
the
only
thing
he
could
think
up
to
say
was
i
him
and
then
apologetically
unless
some
one
been
usin
my
name
without
authority
are
you
actually
the
great
anderson
crow
do
you
know
i
have
always
thought
of
you
as
a
fictitious
character
like
are
you
really
do
i
look
upon
you
in
the
flesh
crow
was
momentarily
overwhelmed
oh
i
i
guess
i
not
much
different
from
other
men
i
not
half
as
important
as
folks
make
me
out
to
be
how
nice
and
modest
you
are
that
is
the
true
sign
of
greatness
crow
i
might
have
known
that
you
would
be
simple
simple
murmured
anderson
to
whom
the
word
had
but
one
meaning
he
thought
of
willie
jones
the
village
idiot
thou
art
a
jewel
observed
the
veiled
lady
will
you
pardon
a
somewhat
leading
question
mr
crow
lead
on
said
he
still
a
trifle
uncertain
of
himself
who
is
that
man
standing
against
the
tree
beside
you
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
who
is
is
my
what
your
companion
now
he
has
moved
over
behind
the
tree
anderson
shot
a
startled
look
over
his
shoulder
there
ai
any
man
behind
the
tree
i
all
alone
are
you
trying
to
make
sport
of
me
mr
crow
i
should
say
not
i
been
standin
here
fer
some
time
an
i
guess
know
if
anybody
was
do
you
think
i
am
blind
demanded
the
lady
quite
sharply
not
if
you
see
a
man
behind
this
tree
said
he
with
conviction
you
got
the
best
eyesight
of
anybody
i
ever
come
across
that
all
i
got
to
say
i
see
him
very
distinctly
anderson
obligingly
circled
the
tree
do
you
see
him
now
he
inquired
in
an
amused
tone
certainly
he
walked
around
the
tree
just
ahead
of
you
what
the
began
anderson
angrily
but
checked
the
words
in
time
you
are
mistaken
there
ai
no
one
here
me
is
he
one
of
your
subordinates
queried
the
woman
leaning
forward
in
the
attitude
of
one
peering
intently
must
be
a
shadow
you
seein
he
suggested
and
suddenly
was
conscious
of
the
queer
sensation
that
some
one
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
tree
that
it
she
exclaimed
eagerly
a
shadow
are
you
detectives
always
shadowing
some
one
yes
but
we
do
turn
into
shadows
to
do
it
we
just
there
he
is
standing
directly
behind
you
what
object
can
you
possibly
have
crow
in
lying
to
me
about
lying
gasped
anderson
after
a
swift
apprehensive
glance
over
his
shoulder
i
tellin
you
the
gospel
truth
maybe
that
confounded
veil
botherin
your
eyesight
take
it
off
an
you
see
there
no
one
ah
what
a
remarkable
leap
he
must
be
possessed
of
wings
crow
himself
moved
with
such
celerity
that
one
might
have
described
the
movement
as
a
leap
he
was
within
a
yard
of
her
when
he
next
spoke
his
back
was
toward
her
his
eyes
searching
the
darkness
from
which
he
had
sprung
good
lord
you
you
think
there
some
one
there
by
the
way
you
talk
he
leaped
from
behind
that
tree
to
this
one
over
here
it
must
be
thirty
feet
how
perfectly
amazing
by
this
time
the
good
marshal
was
noticeably
impressed
there
was
no
denying
the
fact
that
his
voice
shook
who
lying
he
cried
out
she
took
no
offence
instead
she
pointed
down
the
dark
sidewalk
it
seemed
to
him
that
her
arm
was
six
feet
long
he
was
fascinated
by
it
now
he
is
climbing
up
the
tree
just
like
a
squirrel
look
anderson
felt
the
cold
perspiration
starting
out
all
over
his
body
i
i
swear
i
ca
see
anybody
at
all
the
marshal
croaked
weakly
run
over
to
that
tree
and
look
up
crow
she
whispered
in
great
agitation
he
is
sitting
on
that
big
limb
looking
at
us
his
eyes
are
like
little
balls
of
fire
send
him
away
please
haltingly
the
marshal
edged
his
way
toward
the
tree
coming
to
its
base
he
peered
upward
he
saw
nothing
that
resembled
a
human
figure
be
careful
called
out
the
veiled
lady
he
is
about
to
swing
down
upon
your
head
hurry
there
did
you
feel
that
anderson
crow
made
a
flying
leap
for
safety
he
had
the
uncanny
feeling
that
his
hair
was
slowly
lifting
the
hat
from
his
head
feel
feel
what
he
gasped
he
swung
down
by
his
hands
and
kicked
at
you
i
was
sure
his
foot
struck
your
head
ah
there
he
goes
again
see
him
he
is
climbing
over
my
wall
no
he
is
running
along
the
top
of
it
like
the
wind
and
he
good
heavens
am
i
am
i
goin
blind
groaned
crow
his
eyes
bulging
now
he
has
disappeared
behind
the
rosebushes
down
in
the
corner
of
the
lot
he
must
be
the
same
man
i
have
seen
always
about
this
time
in
the
evening
if
he
is
one
of
your
men
crow
who
in
heaven
name
is
he
you
you
have
seen
him
before
murmured
the
marshal
reaching
up
to
make
sure
that
his
hat
was
still
in
place
four
or
five
times
last
night
he
climbed
up
and
stood
beside
that
big
chimney
up
there
silhouetted
against
the
sky
he
looked
very
tall
much
taller
than
any
ordinary
man
the
night
before
he
was
out
here
on
the
lawn
jumping
from
bush
to
bush
for
all
the
world
like
a
harlequin
once
he
actually
leaped
from
the
ground
up
to
the
roof
of
the
porch
as
easily
as
you
would
spring
where
are
you
going
mr
crow
i
i
thought
i
saw
him
runnin
down
the
street
just
now
said
anderson
crow
quickening
his
pace
after
a
parting
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
tall
lady
in
the
gateway
maybe
i
can
overtake
him
if
i
if
i
but
i
guess
i
better
hurry
he
seems
to
be
runnin
mighty
fast
he
was
twenty
feet
away
when
she
called
after
him
a
note
of
warning
in
her
voice
you
are
mistaken
he
is
following
you
he
is
right
at
your
heels
mr
crow
this
was
quite
enough
for
anderson
crow
he
broke
into
a
run
as
he
clattered
past
the
lower
end
of
the
garden
wall
a
low
horrifying
chuckle
fell
upon
his
ears
it
was
not
the
laugh
of
a
human
being
he
afterwards
described
it
as
the
chortle
of
a
hyena
hoarse
and
wild
and
full
of
ghoulish
glee
alf
reesling
house
was
two
blocks
down
the
street
reesling
was
getting
a
bit
of
fresh
air
in
his
front
yard
the
picket
gate
was
open
probably
to
let
in
the
air
and
he
was
leaning
upon
one
of
the
posts
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
almost
before
he
knew
what
had
happened
they
were
receding
anderson
swept
past
his
chin
up
his
legs
working
like
the
astonished
alf
recognized
his
friend
and
adviser
hey
he
shouted
it
was
a
physical
impossibility
for
anderson
to
slacken
his
speed
at
the
same
time
it
was
equally
impossible
for
him
to
increase
it
alf
scenting
excitement
set
out
at
top
speed
behind
him
shouting
all
the
time
pursued
and
pursuer
held
their
relative
positions
until
they
rounded
into
main
street
reaching
the
zone
of
light
and
safety
produced
by
and
open
doors
the
marshal
put
on
the
brakes
and
ventured
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
alf
lacking
the
incentive
that
spurred
anderson
lagged
some
distance
behind
a
second
glance
reassured
the
marshal
alf
was
lumbering
heavily
past
brubaker
drugstore
fully
revealed
observing
an
empty
chair
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
crow
directed
his
slowing
footsteps
toward
it
he
flopped
down
with
an
abruptness
that
almost
dismembered
it
he
was
fanning
himself
with
his
hat
when
alf
came
up
alf
leaned
against
the
wooden
indian
that
guarded
the
portals
presently
he
wheezed
wha
what
all
the
rumpus
instead
of
replying
crow
pressed
his
hand
to
his
heart
and
shook
his
head
take
your
time
advised
alf
sympathetically
whereupon
anderson
nodded
his
head
sim
jackson
ambled
to
the
front
door
and
mort
fryback
hobbled
across
the
street
from
his
hardware
store
lum
gillespie
dropped
the
hose
with
which
he
was
sousing
an
automobile
in
front
of
his
garage
and
approached
the
group
in
less
than
three
minutes
all
of
the
nighthawks
of
main
street
were
gathered
about
anderson
crow
convinced
that
something
unusual
was
in
the
air
despite
his
protests
suddenly
the
marshal
manner
changed
he
swept
the
considerable
group
with
an
appraising
eye
and
then
in
a
tone
of
authority
said
now
that
i
got
you
all
together
i
hereby
order
you
in
my
capacity
as
an
official
of
the
state
and
county

organized
into
a
posse

will
close
up
immejately
an
report
to
me
here
ready
for
active
work
shortly
after
ten
a
group
of
fifteen
or
eighteen
men
moved
silently
away
from
jackson
led
by
their
he
was
flanked
on
one
side
by
bill
kepsal
the
brawny
blacksmith
and
on
the
other
by
sim
jackson
who
happened
to
possess
a
revolver
after
the
posse
had
turned
into
the
unrelieved
shades
of
maple
street
crow
halted
every
few
yards
and
said
sh
he
had
related
a
portion
but
not
all
of
his
experiences
winding
up
with
the
statement
that
poor
smith
had
been
terribly
frightened
by
the
mysterious
prowler
and
that
it
was
their
duty
as
citizens
to
put
an
end
to
his
activities
if
possible
her
description
of
him
do
fit
anybody
livin
in
this
town
he
had
said
during
the
course
of
his
narrative
we
ai
got
anybody
who
jump
thirty
foot
or
who
shin
up
a
chimbly
like
a
squirrel

ghost

act
of

up
his
sleeves

as
good
as
it

come

now
no
time
to
waste
we
got

all
around
the
place
an
an
nab
him
if
he
shows
himself
again
all
you
fellers
have
got
to
do
is
to
obey
orders
at
the
corner
of
maple
and
sickle
streets
a
few
hundred
feet
from
the
nixon
cottage
the
cavalcade
received
a
whispered
order
to
halt
the
marshal
enjoining
the
utmost
stealth
instructed
his
men
where
to
place
themselves
about
the
grounds
they
were
soon
to
invest
from
various
approaches
after
stealing
over
the
stone
wall
they
were
to
crawl
forward
on
hands
and
knees
until
each
man
found
a
behind
a
bush
or
there
he
was
to
wait
and
watch
the
first
glimpse
of
the
mysterious
intruder
was
to
be
the
signal
for
a
shout
of
alarm
whereupon
the
whole
posse
was
to
close
in
upon
him
without
an
delay
in
course
of
time
the
posse
successfully
debouched
upon
the
lawn
and
occupied
crouching
positions
behind
various
objects
of
nature
the
minutes
slowly
consolidated
themselves
into
half
an
hour
they
were
pretty
well
started
on
the
way
toward
the
mark
and
still
no
sign
of
the
sprightly
stranger
lights
were
gleaming
behind
the
yellow
shades
of
the
downstairs
window
in
the
cottage
through
the
japanese
curtains
enveloping
the
veranda
a
dull
restricted
glow
forced
its
way
out
upon
the
bordering
suddenly
out
of
what
had
become
an
almost
sepulchral
silence
came
the
sound
of
a
woman
voice
the
words
she
uttered
were
so
startling
that
the
listeners
felt
the
flesh
on
their
bones
creep
but
would
poisoning
be
the
surer
and
quicker
way
slip
a
few
drops
of
prussic
acid
into
his
food
and
death
would
be
instantaneous
marshal
crow
clutched
bill
kepsal
arm
did
you
hear
that
he
whispered
she
had
spoken
in
hushed
quavering
tones
then
came
a
man
voice
from
the
porch
above
low
and
suppressed
why
not
wait
till
he
is
asleep
and
let
me
sneak
up
to
him
and
put
the
revolver
to
his
head
but
but
suppose
he
should
awake
and
he
never
open
his
eyes
again
believe
me
poison
is
always
sure
to
work
quickly
or
thoroughly
we
do
want
a
struggle

may
be
right

it
to

sooner

in
and
see
if
he
is
asleep
make
the
slightest
noise
he
he
must
never
know
stealthy
footsteps
as
of
one
tiptoeing
were
heard
by
the
listeners
below
the
porch
then
a
moment
later
the
sound
of
a
woman
sobbing
the
foregoing
conversation
was
distinctly
heard
by
at
least
half
of
marshal
crow
posse
three
of
the
watchers
crouching
not
far
from
anderson
crow
and
his
two
supporters
abruptly
left
their
and
started
swiftly
toward
the
front
gate
the
marshal
intercepted
them

whispered

about

lawn

from
bush
to
bush
advancing
upon
the
house
now
get
ready
sim
whispered
anderson
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
a
dull
smothered
report
as
of
one
striking
the
side
of
a
barrel
reached
the
ears
of
the
assembling
forces
then
a
sharp
agonized
cry
from
the
lady
in
the
veranda
too
late
cried
the
marshal
and
dashed
clumsily
up
the
front
steps
followed
by
four
or
five
of
his
henchmen
yanking
open
the
he
plunged
headlong
into
the
softly
lighted
veranda
behind
him
came
sim
jackson
brandishing
a
revolver
and
bill
kepsal
clutching
the
hammer
he
had
brought
from
his
forge
illustration
open
the
he
plunged
headlong
into
the
softly
lighted
they
stopped
short
a
woman
in
a
filmy
white
gown
cut
extremely
low
in
the
neck
confronted
them
an
expression
of
alarm
in
her
wide
dark
eyes
she
was
very
beautiful
they
had
never
seen
any
one
so
beautiful
so
striking
or
so
startlingly
dressed
she
had
just
arisen
from
the
comfortable
wicker
chair
beside
the
table
the
surface
of
which
was
littered
with
magazines
papers
and
documents
in
all
sorts
of
disorder
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
intrusion
she
demanded
recovering
her
composure
after
the
first
instant
of
alarm
crow
found
his
voice
surrender
peaceable
he
said
i
got

goose
cried
out
the
lady
and
forthwith
burst
into
a
merry
peal
of
laughter
the
marshal
stiffened
that
kind
of
talk
wo
he
began
and
then
broke
off
to
roar

your
laughin

wo

as
if
its
intention
was
to
connect
with
his
ears
my
god

anderson
the
old

genuine
his
distress
so
pitiful
that
the
heart
of
harry

touched

forward
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the

a
few
minutes
later
he
stood
beside
harry
squires
in
the
cellar
below
the
kitchen
there
was
a
smell
of
gunpowder
on
the
close
still
air
they
looked
down
upon
the
black
inanimate
form
of
the
french
poodle
there
hawkshaw
said
harry

marshal
crow
took
off
his
hat
with
the
rest
but
he
did
it
the
better
to
mop
his
forehead
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
there
ai
been
any
man
slew
in
this
house
he
inquired
slowly
up
to
the
hour
of
going
to
press
said
the
city
editor
of
the
no
human
remains
have
been
unearthed
then
where
in
thunder
is
the
feller
who

foolin
around

front
yard
the
last
i
saw
of
him
he
was
beating
it
down
the
street
about
two
hours
ago
and
you
were
giving
him
the
run
of
his
life
i
do
believe
the
rascal
will
ever
dare
come
around
here
again
the
chances
are
he
still
running
the
marshal
muttered
something
under
his
breath
and
shot
a
pleading
look
at
harry
yes
sir
continued
harry
solemnly
i
bet
my
head
he
never
be
seen
in
these
parts
again
if
he
had
got
such
a
start
of
me
said
anderson
regaining
much
of
his
aplomb
i
nabbed
him

as
you
alive
he
could
run
like
a
whitehead
i
never
seen
such
shall

go
upstairs

the
pressure
on

gentlemen
the

no
other
than
the
celebrated
actress
juliet
hildebrand

and
the

before

automobile
an
hour
or
so
ago
his
back
was
broken
i
merely
put
an
end
to
his
suffering
now
come
mister
snooks
inquired
anderson
quickly
well
that

one
of
the
mysteries
that
been
botherin
me
an
an

say
she
the
big
actress
whose
picture
we

in

the
honour

into

and
incidentally
to
enjoy
a
vacation
after
a
long
and
prosperous
season
in
new
york
do
you
mean
to
say

knowed
all
along

she
was
demanded
anderson

comin
up
here
to
see
her
every
night
or
so

harry
amiably
practisin
without
a
dicense
practising
what

jokes
roared
anderson
gleefully
and
slapped
him
on
the
back
again
the
marshal
slapped
the
culprit
back
yes

joke
on
me
i
admit
it
i

up
the
seegars

a

of

harry

miss
hildebrand
will
be
happy
to
have
you
partake
of
her
hold
on
a
minute
harry
broke
in
the
marshal
hastily
his
face
was
a
study
the
painfully
created
joviality
came
to
a
swift
and
uncomfortable
end
and
in
its
place
flashed
a
look
of
embarrassment
he
simply
could
face
the
smiling
miss
hildebrand
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
he
went
on
lowering
his
voice
and
glancing
furtively
over
his
shoulder
at
the
departing
members
of
his
posse
i
guess
i
go
out
the
back
way
seeing
the
surprised
harry
face
he
floundered
badly
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
concluded
with
the
perfectly
good
excuse
that
it
was
his
duty
to
lead
alf
reesling
the
town
drunkard
away
from
temptation
in
support
of
this
resolve
he
called
out
to
alf
come
here
alf
none
that
now
you
come
along
with
me
i
ai
goin
to
touch
anything

a
ham
sandwich
protested
alf
with
considerable
asperity
never
mind
you

tell
you
or
i
run
you
in
remember

a
wife
an
daughter

on
the
for
years
mr
marshal
i
think
you
can
trust
him
began
harry
but
anderson
checked
him
with
a
resolute
gesture
ca
take
any
chances
with
him
he
got
to
come
with
me
nonsense
exclaimed
harry
an
besides
said
anderson
a
man
in
my
position
ca
afford
to
be
seen
associatin
with
actresses
an
you
know
it
harry
squires
come
on
alf
the
astonishing
acts
of
anna
the
case
of
loop
loop
was
docketed
for
the
september
term
in
the
bramble
county
circuit
court
at
boggs
city
when
it
became
officially
known
in
tinkletown
through
the
columns
of
the
that
eliphalet
loop
had
brought
suit
for
divorce
against
his
wife
anna
the
town
experienced
a
convulsion
that
bore
symptoms
of
continuing
without
abatement
until
snow
fell
and
perhaps
depending
on
the
evidence
introduced
throughout
the
entire
winter
for
eliphalet
in
accusing
his
wife
was
obliged
to
state
in
his
bill
that
the
identity
and
whereabouts
of
said
were
at
present
unknown
to
complainant
as
loop
emphatically
some
said
spitefully
declined
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
loop
and
the
whole
of
tinkletown
as
well
speculation
took
such
an
impatient
attitude
toward
her
that
eliphalet
had
he
been
minded
to
do
so
could
have
made
use
of
any
one
of
three
hundred
names
in
a
village
boasting
an
adult
male
population
of
three
hundred
and
seventeen
husbands
who
had
been
in
the
habit
of
loafing
around
the
village
stores
for
a
couple
of
hours
after
supper
winter
and
summer
now
felt
constrained
to
remain
later
than
usual
for
fear
that
persons
outstaying
them
might
question
the
statement
that
they
were
going
home
and
many
a
wife
who
was
seldom
awake
after
nine
stayed
up
until
the
man
of
the
house
was
safely
inside
where
she
could
look
at
him
with
an
intentness
so
strange
that
he
began
to
develop
a
ferocious
hatred
for
loop
the
town
marshal
anderson
crow
encountering
the
lugubrious
eliphalet
in
front
of
brown
office
early
one
morning
several
weeks
after
the
filing
of
the
complaint
put
this
question
to

asperity
i

anderson
compressing
his
lips
fair
liff

stubbornly
i
wo
ask
her
you

a
wallop
over

head
with
a
like
i
did
when

asked
her
the
first
time
he
removed
his
straw
hat
see
that
doc
brown
had
to
take
seven
stitches
in
it
an
he
says
if
old
hawkins
the
undertaker

seen
it
first
i
would
have
had
to
send
for
a
doctor
at
all
you
ask
her
yourself
if

blamed
anxious
to

i

her
out
in
the
back
yard
just
i
left
she

down
in

so
i
sez
to
her
as
gentle
as
i
knowed
how
an
as
legally
as
possible
on
the
advice
of
my
lawyer
mornin
mrs

an
then
when

her
lookin
around
for
somethin
to
throw
at
me
i
knowed
it

tryin
to

so
i
sez
out
o
my
sight
you
old
cow
and
you
could
say
scat
she
was
out
o
my
sight
i
did
know
it
was
possible
for
me
to
be
so
spry
at
age
just
as
she
was
gettin
out
o
my
sight
by
me
gettin
around
the
corner
of
the
barn
i
heard
somethin
go
the
side
of
the
barn
but
i
do
know
what
it
was
sounded
like
a
anderson
looked
at
him
sorrowfully
well
you
ca
say
i
did
warn
you
liff
warn
me
about
what
advertisin
fer
a
wife
i
told
you
no
good
could
come
of
it
now
i
guess
you
agree
that
i
was
right
oh
shucks
anna
was
as
good
a
woman
as
i
ever
had
andy
crow
an
i
do
know
as
i
ever
had
a
better
worker
around
the
place
fer
two
years
she
he
choked
up
and
began
to
sniffle
there
ai
no
denyin
the
fact
she
lasted
any
of
agreed
anderson
i
do
just
exactly
remember
how
many
funerals
you
had
liff
but
say
just
out
o
curiosity
how
many
have
you
had
me
crow
had
a
dispute
about
it
last
evenin
it
cost
me
a
lot
o
money
anderson
a
turrible
lot
o
money
groaned
eliphalet
what
with
doctors
bills
an
coffins
nothin
absolutely
nothin
to
show
fer
it
no
children
no
but
an
tombstones
by
gosh
why
is
it
last
so
long
i
got
five
livin
this
minute
an
the
good
lord
knows
i
never
done
anything
to
encourage
i
lost
four
wives
an
not
a
single
it
do
seem
right
now
does
it
anderson
well
if
you
married
somebody
nearer
your
own
age
liff
you
might
stand
some
chance
of
their
mothers
but
you
been
women
anywheres
from
fifty
to
sixty
years
you
are
you
must
be
derned
near
eighty
if
you
git
too
old
they
allus
complainin
about
doin
the
work
around
the
house
and
garden
an
then
you
got
to
git
a
hired
girl
specially
the
washin
seems
to
me
it
be
cheaper
in
the
long
run
to
work
a
hired
girl
to
death
rather
than
a
wife
said
anderson
tartly
most
generally
it
is
agreed
loop
but
i
sorter
got
into
the
habit
of
marryin
hired
girls
figgerin
they
make
the
best
kind
of
wives
i
give
a
good
home
plenty
to
eat
an
his
eyes
roamed
aloft
as
if
searching
for
some
other
beneficence
and
finally
lighting
on
brown
found
something
to
clinch
his
argument
as
fine
a
funeral
as
any
woman
could
ask
fer
he
concluded
let
git
back
to
the
main
question
said
anderson
unfeelingly
he
did
have
much
use
for
eliphalet
what
fer
sort
of
lookin
feller
is
this
man
your
wife
been
carryin
on
with
well
began
loop
squinting
his
bleary
eyes
reflectively
i
never
seen
him
when
he
was
runnin
an
it
was
after
dark
besides
twice
i
seen
him
jump
out
of
one
of
our
back
winders
when
i
got
home
usual
from
first
time
i
made
out
he
was
a
burglar
an
hustled
in
to
see
if
he
had
took
anything
you
see
i
allus
keep
my
pocketbook
in
a
burey
drawer
in
our
bedroom
an
natcherly
as
it
was
our
bedroom
winder
he
jumped
out
of
i
well
natcherly
i
be
a
little
uneasy
would
i
specially
if
you
thought
your
wife
might
been
rendered
insensible
by
the
robber
said
anderson
natcherly
said
loop
quickly
course
i
thought
of
her
first
of
all
well
after
i
went
to
the
burey
an
found
the
pocketbook
all
safe
i
asked
anna
if
she
heard
anybody
tryin
to
get
in
through
the
winder
she
looked
kinder
fer
a
second
er
two
an
then
said
no
she
had
i
told
her
what
i
seen
and
she
said
i
must
be
drunk
er
somethin
she
been
in
the
room
all
the
time
havin
a
bite
of
somethin
to
eat
goin
to
bed
i
never
saw
anybody
that
could
eat
that
woman
anderson
she
allus
eatin
course
i
believed
her
time
there
was
a
plate
o
cold
ham
an
some
biscuits
an
oh
a
lot
of
other
victuals
on
the
washstand
with
only
one
knife
an
fork
her
mother
was
sound
asleep
in
her
room
upstairs
an
her
sister
gertie
who
come
to
visit
us
six
months
ago
an
is
still
visitin

eliphalet
loop
interposed
anderson
well
said
eliphalet
patiently
i
kinder
figered
i
might
been
mistaken
about
seein
him
that
first
time
but
when
the
same
thing
happened
on
the
night
i
went
over
to
set
up
with
jim
corpse
why
i
jest
natcherly
begin
to
think
it
was
kinder
funny
what
set
me
thinkin
ever
was
finding
a
man
hat
in
my
room
hangin
on
the
back
of
a
chair
thinks
i
that
mighty
funny
specially
as
the
hat
was
mine
what
kind
of
a
hat
was
it
questioned
anderson
taking
out
his
notebook
and
pencil
describe
it
carefully
liff
it
was
a
grey
fewdory
said
loop
the
one

as
nobody
claimed
it
explained
the
ingenuous
husband
of
anna
it
was
a
couple
of
sizes
too
big
fer
me
so
i
stuffed
some
paper
inside
the
i
allus
hate
to
have
a
hat
comin
down
on
my
ears
do
you
kinder
spreads
out
well
the
first
thing
we
got
to
do
liff
is
to
find
some
one
with
a
head
two
sizes
yours
said
anderson
giving
his
whiskers
a
slow
speculative
twist
that
ought
to
be
hard
to
do
said
eliphalet
without
hesitation
i
wear
a
five
an
most
everybody
i
know
wears
a
bigger
hat
than

do
that
makes
it
more
difficult

a
new
york

stamped
on
the

the
most
awful
you

said
anderson
sternly
well

ai

the
same
feller

but
last

man
streakin
through

he
was
carryin
a
bundle
an
was
all
stooped
over
i
yelled
at
him
to
stop
er
i
fire
that
seemed
to
make
him
run
a
little
faster
so
i
took
after
him
an
run
smack
into
anna
comin
round
the
corner
of
the
soon
as
i
got
my
breath
i
asked
her
what
in
tarnation
she
was
doin
out
at
that
time
o
night
well
go
on
what
did
she
say
demanded
anderson
as
loop
paused
to
wipe
his
forehead
she
she
insulted
me
said
loop
how
inquired
marshal
crow
sceptically
she
called
me
a
skunk
crow
was
silent
for
some
time
tugging
at
his
whiskers
he
stared
intently
at
the
upper
corner
of
brown
cottage
his
lip
twitched
slightly
presently
feeling
that
he
could
trust
his
voice
he
asked
why
do
you
offer
a
reward
liff
i
thought
of
doin
that
said
loop
but
a
trifle
if
you
offer
a
big
enough
reward
i
find
out
who
the
feller
is
said
anderson
course
you
understand
it
ai
my
duty
as
marshal
to
ferret
out
matrimonial
mysteries
i
have
to
tackle
it
in
my
capacity
as
a
private
detective
an
you
could
hardly
expect
me
to
do
all
this
extry
work
without
bein
paid
fer
it
loop
scratched
his
head
then
he
scratched
a
small
furrow
in
the
gravel
roadway
with
the
toe
of
one
of
his
boots
well
you
see
i
got
to
pay
a
lawyer
right
smart
of
a
fee
besides
anderson
interrupted
him
sternly
you
owe
it
to
your
to
clear
up
this
mystery
you
surely
do
think
it
is
fair
to
your
friends
do
you
loop
purty
nigh
every
man
in
town
is
suspicioned
an
that
ai
any
business
o
mine
snapped
eliphalet
showing
some
ire
if
they
feel
as
though
the
thing
ought
to
be
cleared
up
jest
fer
sakes
why
do
they
git
together
an
offer
a
reward
i
see
why
i
ought
to
pay
out
money
to
the
innocence
of
all
the
men
in
tinkletown
let
them
do
it
if
they
feel
that
way
about
it
i
got
no
objection
to
the
taxpayers
of
tinkletown
oppropriatin
a
sum
out
of
the
town
treasury
to
prove
they
innocent
why
do
you
take
it
up
with
the
selectmen
anderson
i
satisfied
to
leave
my
complaint
as
it
is
i
been
thinkin
it
over
an
i
believe
i
ruther
git
my
divorce
without
knowin
who
the
cause
of
it
the
way
it
is
now
i
on
friendly
terms
with
every
man
in
town
an
i
like
to
stay
that
way
it
would
be
mighty
onpleasant
to
meet
one
of
your
friends
on
the
street
not
be
able
to
speak
to
him
long
as
i
know
why
wait
a
minute
liff
loop
broke
in
anderson
sternly
do
say
anything
more
all
i
got
to
say
is
that
it
was
your
wife
insulted
when
she
called
you
a
skunk
good
mornin
sir
he
turned
and
strode
away
leaving
the
amazed
loop
standing
with
his
mouth
open
some
time
later
that
same
afternoon
eliphalet
succeeded
in
solving
the
problem
that
had
been
tantalizing
him
all
day
by
gum
he
bleated
addressing
the
high
heavens
what
a
blamed
old
fool
he
is
anybody
with
any
sense
at
all
knows
that
you
insult
a
skunk
briefly
loop
fifth
matrimonial
experience
had
been
in
the
strictest
sense
a
venture
after
four
discouraging
failures
in
the
effort
to
obtain
a
durable
wife
from
among
the
young
women
of
tinkletown
and
vicinity
he
had
resolved
to
go
farther
afield
for
his
fifth
so
he
advertised
through
a
new
york
matrimonial
bureau
for
the
sort
of
wife
he
might
reasonably
depend
upon
to
survive
the
rigours
of
climate
industry
and
thrift
he
made
it
quite
plain
that
the
lucky
applicant
would
have
to
be
a
robust
creature
white
sound
of
lung
and
limb
not
more
than
thirty
and
experienced
in
domestic
economy
nationality
no
object
loop
idea
of
the
meaning
of
domestic
economy
was
intensely
literal
also
she
would
have
to
pay
her
own
railroad
fare
to
boggs
city
no
matter
whence
she
came
the
same
to
be
refunded
in
case
she
proved
acceptable
he
described
himself
as
a
widower
of
means
young
in
spirit
though
somewhat
past
middle
age
of
attractive
personality
and
an
experienced
husband
the
present
loop
was
the
result
of
this
spirit
of
enterprise
on
his
part
she
came
from
hoboken
new
jersey
and
her
name
was
anna
petersen
before
it
was
altered
to
loop
she
more
than
fulfilled
the
requirements
as
loop
himself
proclaimed
there
was
a
robuster
woman
in
bramble
county
she
was
exceedingly
sound
of
lung
and
equally
sound
of
limb
what
pleased
him
more
than
anything
else
she
was
a
swede
he
had
always
heard
that
the
swedish
women
were
the
most
frugal
the
most
industrious
and
a
shade
more
amenable
to
male
authority
than
any
others
anna
was
a
towering
rather
overdeveloped
female
she
revealed
such
astonishing
propensities
for
work
that
she
had
been
a
bride
but
little
more
than
a
week
when
eliphalet
decided
that
he
could
dispense
with
the
services
of
a
hired
man
a
little
later
he
discovered
much
to
his
surprise
that
there
really
was
quite
enough
work
about
the
house
to
keep
her
occupied
all
the
time
and
so
he
allowed
her
to
take
over
some
of
the
chores
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
performing
such
as
feeding
the
horses
and
pigs
and
ultimately
to
chop
and
carry
in
the
firewood
wash
the
buckboard
milk
the
cows
and
in
spare
moments
to
weed
the
garden
he
began
to
regard
himself
as
the
most
fortunate
man
alive
anna
appeared
to
thrive
where
her
predecessors
had
withered
and
wasted
away
true
she
ate
considerably
more
than
any
of
them
but
he
was
willing
to
put
up
with
that
provided
she
did
go
so
far
to
eat
as
much
as
of
them
there
were
times
however
when
he
experienced
a
great
deal
of
uneasiness
on
that
score
the
fly
avoided
his
ointment
for
something
like
three
months
then
it
came
and
settled
and
bade
fair
to
remain
and
thrive
upon
the
fat
of
his
land
anna
mother
came
to
live
with
them
he
now
realized
that
he
had
been
extremely
shortsighted
he
should
have
stipulated
in
his
advertisement
that
none
except
motherless
young
women
need
apply
petersen
was
his
fifth
and
he
dolefully
found
himself
contending
with
the
paraphrase
like
mother
like
daughter
his
latest
proved
to
be
a
voracious
as
well
as
a
vociferous
eater
she
fell
little
short
of
anna
in
physical
proportions
but
his
wife
assured
him
that
it
would
be
no
time
at
all
before
she
have
her
as
plump
as
a
partridge
loop
undertook
the
experiment
of
a
joke
he
asked
her
if
was
the
swede
word
for
after
that
he
kept
his
jokes
to
himself
a
year
and
a
half
went
by
then
miss
gertie
petersen
came
up
from
hoboken
for
a
flying
visit
she
was
a
very
tall
and
lean
young
woman
loop
shuddered
the
process
of
developing
her
into
a
partridge
was
something
horrible
to
contemplate
but
anna
was
not
dismayed
she
insisted
that
the
country
air
would
do
her
sister
a
world
of
good
loop
was
a
pained
witness
to
the
filling
out
of
gertrude
but
something
told
him
that
it
was
the
country
air
that
was
doing
it
she
weighed
in
the
neighbourhood
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
when
she
flew
in
for
the
visit
at
the
end
of
six
months
she
strained
the
scales
at
two
hundred
and
twenty
there
was
a
good
deal
of
in
his
contention
that
if
all
this
additional
weight
was
country
air
have
to
be
pretty
securely
anchored
or
she
float
away
like
a
balloon
but
he
did
not
openly
complain
he
had
acquired
the
wisdom
of
the
vanquished
he
was
surrounded
by
conquerors
moreover
at
he
had
seen
his
wife
pick
up
a
squealing
shoat
with
one
hand
and
slit
its
throat
with
the
other
in
such
a
skilful
and
efficient
manner
that
gooseflesh
crept
out
all
over
his
body
when
he
thought
of
it
illustration
was
surrounded
by
and
during
those
long
solitary
nights
in
the
barn
he
thought
of
it
so
constantly
that
everything
else
including
the
encroachment
of
the
slipped
his
mind
completely
he
never
ceased
wondering
how
he
screwed
up
the
courage
to
institute
proceedings
against
anna
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
matter
had
been
vicariously
attended
to
by
his
lawyer
and
a
deputy
from
the
county
sheriff
office
marshal
crow
fell
into
a
state
of
profound
cogitation
after
leaving
loop
the
old
man
had
put
a
new
idea
into
his
head
late
in
the
afternoon
he
decided
to
call
a
meeting
of
citizens
at
the
town
hall
for
that
night
he
drafted
the
assistance
of
such
able
idlers
as
alf
reesling
newt
spratt
rush
applegate
henry
plumb
and
situate
jones
and
ordered
them
to
impress
upon
all
male
citizens
of
tinkletown
between
the
ages
of
and
the
importance
of
attending
this
meeting
ebenezer
january
the
barber
and
george
washington
smith
the
driver
were
the
only
two
men
in
town
whose
presence
was
not
considered
necessary
they
with
their
somewhat
extensive
families
represented
the
total
coloured
population
of
tinkletown
when
the
impromptu
gathering
was
called
to
order
that
night
by
ezra
pounder
the
town
clerk
acting
in
an
unofficial
capacity
there
were
nearly
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
present
including
january
and
smith
uncle
dad
simms
aged
was
present
occupying
a
front
seat
he
confessed
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
was
a
little
hard
o
hearin
this
was
a
most
gratifying
triumph
for
his
who
for
a
matter
of
twenty
years
had
almost
yelled
their
lungs
out
advising
him
to
get
an
only
to
have
him
say
what
in
thunder
are
you
whisperin
about
the
three
clergymen
of
the
town

in
an
appearance
and
elmer
pratt
the
photographer
brought
his
baby
explaining
that
it
was
night
to
take
care
of
her
he
assured
the
gentlemen
present
that
they
were
at
liberty
to
speak
as
freely
and
as
loudly
as
they
pleased
so
far
as
his
daughter
was
concerned
if
she
got
awake
and
started
to
yap
he
spank
the
daylights
out
of
her
and
if
that
did
shut
her
up
he
take
her
home
anderson
crow
wearing
all
his
decorations
occupied
a
chair
between
pounder
and
harry
squires
the
reporter
by
actual
count
there
were
seven
badges
ranging
across
his
chest
prominent
among
them
were
the
familiar
emblems
of
the
two
detective
associations
to
which
he
paid
annual
dues
besides
these
one
could
have
made
out
the
star
of
the
town
marshal
the
shield
of
the
fire
chief

of
the
grand
army
of

of

of
the
revolution
and
the
tinkletown
battlefield
association
harry
squires
at
the
request
of
crow
arose
and
stated
the
object
of
the
meeting
gentlemen
he
began
the
time
has
come
for
action
we
have
been
patient
long
enough
a
small
committee
of
citizens
got
together
today
and
acting
upon
the
suggestion
of
our
distinguished
marshal
decided
to
make
a
determined
effort
to
restore
peace
and
confidence
into
the
home
of
practically
every
gentleman
in
this
community
it
is
a
moral
certainty
that
all
of
us
ca
be
the
individual
in
loop
woodpile
but
it
is
also
more
or
less
an
immoral
certainty
that
loop
obstinately
refuses
to
vindicate
an
overwhelming
majority
of
the
citizens
of
this
town
the
situation
is
intolerable
we
are
in
a
painful
state
of
perplexity
one
of
us
gentlemen
appears
to
be
a
the
question
naturally
arises
which
one
of
us
is
it
nobody
answers
as
a
matter
of
fact
up
to
date
nobody
has
actually
the
charge
can
it
be
a
matter
of
false
pride
with
us
ahem
however
not
only
does
loop
decline
to
lift
the
shadow
of
doubt
but
loop
has
assumed
a
most
determined
and
uncharitable
attitude
toward
his
friends
and
neighbours
he
positively
refuses
to
come
to
our
rescue
we
have
put
up
with
loop
for
a
great
many
years
gentlemen
and
what
do
we
get
for
our
pains
nothing
gentlemen
nothing
except
loop
cheerful
wink
when
he
passes
us
on
the
street
our
esteemed
marshal
today
proposed
to
loop
that
he
offer
a
suitable
reward
for
the
apprehension
of
the
man
in
the
case
he
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
do
something
for
his
friends
and
acquaintances
what
does
loop
say
to
the
proposition
he
was
more
than
magnanimous
he
as
much
as
said
that
he
could
bear
the
idea
that
any
one
of
his
numerous
friends
was
innocent
now
while
loop
may
feel
that
he
is
being
extremely
generous
we
must
feel
otherwise
gentlemen
we
have
arrived
at
the
point
where
we
must
take
our
reputations
out
of
eliphalet
loop
hands
we
can
not
afford
to
let
him
trifle
with
them
any
longer
loop
refuses
to
employ
a
detective
therefore
it
is
up
to
us
to
secure
the
services
of
a
competent
experienced
sleuth
who
can
and
will
establish
our
innocence
it
will
cost
us
a
little
money
possibly
fifty
cents
apiece
but
what
is
that
compared
to
a
fair
name
i
am
confident
that
there
is
a
man
here
who
would
give
as
much
as
ten
dollars
even
if
he
had
to
steal
it
in
order
to
protect
his
honour
now
gentlemen
you
know
what
we
are
here
for
the
meeting
is
open
for
suggestions
and
discussion
he
sat
down
but
almost
instantly
arose
his
gaze
fixed
on
an
object
in
the
rear
of
the
hall
i
see
that
loop
has
just
come
in
perhaps
he
has
some
news
for
us
have
you
anything
to
say
mr
loop
loop
got
up
and
cleared
his
throat
nothin
said
he
except
that
i
as
willin
as
anybody
to
subscribe
fifty
cents
harry
squires
suddenly
put
his
hand
over
his
mouth
and
turned
to
marshal
crow
the
marshal
arose
this
ai
no
affair

him
on
his
head
he
might
accidently
squash
that
new
fewdory
hat
he
wearin
after
loop
unceremonious
departure
the
marshal
resumed
his
seat
and
fell
to
twisting
his
sparse
whiskers
what
is
your
opinion
crow
inquired
harry
squires
as
to
the
amount
we
would
have
to
pay
a
good
detective
to
tackle
the
job
crow
ran
a
calculating
eye
over
the
crowd
he
did
not
at
once
reply
finally
he
spoke
between
a
hundred
and
five
an
a
hundred
an
seven
dollars
he
said
it
might
run
as
high
as
hundred
and
ten
he
added
as
two
or
three
belated
citizens
entered
the
hall
can

get
a
goot
man

inquired
henry
wimpelmeyer
the
tanyard
man

or

without
lightin
a
lantern

said
crow
in
a
slightly
bellicose
tone
i
ai
so
sure
aboudt
dot
said
henry
eying
the
marshal
skeptically
he
had
had
it
in
for
marshal
crow
ever
since
that
official
compelled
him
to
hang
an
american
flag
in
front
of
his
tanyard
luckily
uncle
dad
simms
who
had
not
heard
a
word
of
the
foregoing
remarks
piped
up
this
ai
no
time
to
be
thinkin
of
unnecessary
improvements
what
with
peace
not
signed
yet
an
labor
an
material
so
high
i
do
see
that
there
any
call
for
a
new
roof
anyway
it
does
leak
a
little
once
in
a
while
we
all
got
umbrellas

approvingly
but
i
wish
you

chaw
tobacker
alf
he
added
rather
plaintively
order
commanded
marshal
crow
pounding
on
the
table
with
his
cane
now
let
us
git
down
to
business
most
of
us
have
got
to
be
home
before
nine
or
the
dickens
will
be
to
pay
all
those
in
favour
of
employin
a
detective
to
unearth
this
dark
mystery
raise
their
right
hands
just
a
moment
please
called
out
the
reverend
maltby
of
the
congregationalist
church
i
presume
i
am
safe
in
saying
that
father
maloney
the
reverend
downs
and
myself
are
hardly
to
be
regarded
as
interested
parties
he
was
interrupted
by
father
maloney
who
sprang
to
his
feet
and
shouted
in
his
most
jovial
voice
nonsense
my
dear
maltby
i
consider
it
a
great
honour
to
be
considered
in
the
list
of
suspects
nothing
could
give
me
more
pleasure
than
the
feeling
that
my
parishioners
trusted
me
sufficiently
to
take
me
to
their
hearts
and
say
is
one
of
us
i
should
consider
myself
very
badly
treated
if
they
were
to
leave
me
out
of
the
case
come
join
me
let
us
get
all
we
can
out
of
a
most
delicate
situation
what
do
you
say
friend
downs
the
methodist
minister
an
elderly
person
looked
a
trifle
dashed
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
heartily
declared
himself
as
with
father
maloney
whereupon
maltby
said
he
guessed
it
would
be
all
right
provided
squires
promised
not
to
publish
the
names
harry
squires
promptly
announced
that
he
intended
to
save
labour
and
space
by
stating
briefly
and
concisely
that
if
any
of
his
feminine
readers
cared
to
have
a
list
of
those
present
she
could
get
it
very
easily
and
alphabetically
by
consulting
the
the
outcome
of
the
meeting
may
be
recorded
in
a
very
few
words
although
a
great
many
were
required
in
its
achievement
virtually
everybody
including
the
coloured
gentry
had
something
to
say
on
the
subject
and
most
of
them
said
it
without
reservations
after
squires
had
announced
that
any
man
who
voted
in
the
negative
would
automatically
convict
himself
there
was
a
man
present
who
failed
to
subscribe
fifty
cents
toward
the
civic
honour
fund
it
was
found
on
computation
that
the
total
amount
was
one
hundred
nine
dollars
and
fifty
cents
marshal
crow
at
once
increased
his
contribution
to
one
dollar
declaring
it
would
be
mortifying
to
offer
a
reward
of
less
than
one
hundred
and
ten
dollars
to
any
decent
detective
january
and
smith
insisted
on
their
rights
as
citizens
to
join
in
the
movement
january
took
the
floor
and
vociferously
harangued
the
assemblage
at
some
length
on
certain
provisions
of
the
proclamation
of
emancipation
and
smith
said
that
this
was
no
time
to
draw
the
crow
consented
to
undertake
the
baffling
case
and
it
was
so
ordered
have
you
got
a
clue
whispered
alf
reesling
as
he
started
homeward
in
the
wake
of
the
preoccupied
sleuth
no
but
i
will
have
mornin
replied
anderson
and
he
never
uttered
truer
words
in
all
his
life
being
a
man
of
action
crow
began
operations
at
once
he
went
home
and
for
nearly
an
hour
worked
over
the
list
of
subscribers
to
the
fund
aided
by
his
wife
and
daughters
among
them
they
separated
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
at
least
twenty
per
cent
of
the
contributors
were
set
aside
in
a
separate
group
and
labelled
no
good
ten
per
cent
were
designated
as
fairly
good
and
the
remainder
as
good
it
must
not
be
assumed
that
the
division
had
anything
to
do
with
the
loop
mystery
crow
was
merely
figuring
out
who
would
pay
and
who
would
not
it
was
shortly
after
ten
when
he
started
in
a
roundabout
way
for
the
home
of
eliphalet
loop
the
more
direct
route
would
have
been
down
the
street
from
his
own
house
to
the
boggs
city
pike
first
turn
to
the
left
fifty
paces
straight
ahead
and
he
would
have
found
himself
at
eliphalet
front
gate
in
all
a
matter
of
half
a
mile
but
he
preferred
to
descend
upon
the
premises
from
an
unexpected
angle
so
he
approached
by
a
far
circuitous
way
and
arrived
at
the
gate
after
traversing
something
like
three
miles
of
wood
and
stealthily
following
the
fences
in
order
to
screen
his
movements
he
was
well
aware
that
loop
did
not
own
a
dog
on
account
of
the
expense
the
house
was
dark
crow
leaned
against
the
and
mopped
his
brow
then
he
blew
his
nose
it
was
his
custom
when
he
blew
his
nose
to
blow
it
with
tremendous
force
having
performed
these
highly
interesting
feats
he
restored
his
handkerchief
to
his
hip
pocket
he
remembered
quite
clearly
doing
all
these
things
afterwards
he
claimed
that
he
blew
his
nose
as
a
signal
in
any
case
it
to
be
a
signal
a
thinly
pleated
light
appeared
in
one
of
the
front
windows
of
the
house
narrow
little
streaks
one
above
the
other
shining
through
the
the
marshal
of
tinkletown
stared
he
craned
his
neck
a
chill
of
excitement
swept
over
him
was
he
about
to
witness
the
surreptitious
departure
of
the
unwelcome
guest
had
he
arrived
in
the
nick
of
time
and
what
in
the
world
was
he
to
do
if
the
fellow
had
a
revolver
fascinated
he
watched
one
of
the
blinds
slowly
swing
outward
he
held
his
breath
suddenly
it
dawned
on
him
that
the
visitor
was
still
and
not
on
the
point
of
departing
in
that
case
it
behooved
him
to
retire
to
a
less
exposed
spot
where
he
could
observe
the
fellow
without
being
observed
stooping
low
he
stole
across
the
road
and
wound
his
way
through
the
scraggly
hedgerow
and
into
the
brambles
beyond
just
as
he
was
settling
himself
down
for
his
vigil
a
most
astonishing
thing
occurred
a
hand
fell
heavily
upon
his
shoulder
and
something
cold
punched
him
in
the
back
of
the
neck
and
remained
fixed
in
that
spot
do
move
or
i
blow
your
brains
out
whispered
a
voice
in
his
ear
the
grip
on
his
shoulder
tightened
who
who
he
started
to
gasp
shut
up
hissed
the
voice
of
the
invisible
one
i
got

dead

your
hands

strangled
voice

swear

will
it
by
thunder
fell
from
the
lips
of
the
captor
it
was
an
exclamation
of
surprise
even
dismay
take
it
away
if
it
a
revolver
pleaded
anderson

the
case

the
house
if

him
between
us
he
wo
have
any
more
chance
than
a
snowball
in
look
there
he
is
sneaking
across
the
yard
by
golly
we
got
him
at
last
what
happened
in
the
next
fifteen
seconds
was
a
revelation
to
the
most
recent
addition
to
the
forces
of
the
international
society
of
sleuths
he
witnessed
the
quick
businesslike
methods
of
two
of
the
craftiest
men
in
the
craftiest
organization
in
the
world
the
united
states
secret
service
two
words
were
spoken
they
came
loud
and
imperative
from
a
point
near
the
house
hands
up
the
skulking
figure
in
the
yard
stopped
short
but
only
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
then
he
made
a
wild
spring
toward
the
front
gate
a
shot
rang
out
the
man
at
anderson
side
leaped
forward
through
the
hedge
crow
was
dimly
conscious
of
a
mishap
to
his
erstwhile
captor
he
heard
him
curse
as
he
went
sprawling
over
a
treacherous
vine
crow
did
not
waste
a
second
time
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
started
pellmell
for
home
with
rare
sagacity
he
avoided
the
highway
and
laid
his
course
well
inside
the
hedgerow
he
knew
where
he
could
strike
an
open
stretch
of
meadowland
and
he
headed
for
it
through
the
brambles
he
heard
shouts
behind
him
and
the
rush
of
feet
if
he
could
only
get
clear
of
the
cussed
bushes
that
was
his
thought
as
he
plunged
along
down
he
went
with
a
crash
as
the
marshal
tried
to
rise
a
huge
object
ploughed
through
the
hedge
beside
him
and
the
next
instant
he
was
knocked
flat
and
breathless
by
the
impact
of
this
hurtling
body
the
next
instant
two
swift
ruthless
figures
came
plunging
through
the
hedge
and
he
found
himself
embroiled
in
a
seething
of
panting
struggling
men
presently
crow
sat
up
the
steady
glare
of
a
revealed
a
picture
he
was
never
to
forget
a
single
figure
in
a
kneeling
position
hands
on
high
was
crying
do
shoot
do
shoot
over
him
stood
two
men
with
pistols
levelled
at
the
white
terrified
face
illustration
him
stood
two
men
with
pistols
levelled
at
the
white
terrified
anderson
to
his
dying
day
was
to
remember
those
bulging
eyes
the
flabby
and
unshaven
face
the
mouth
that
appeared
to
be
grinning
but
never
had
he
seen
such
an
unnatural
grin
stand
up
commanded
one
of
the
men
and
the
victim
struggled
to
his
feet
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
the
fellow
was
searched
and
run
back
there
pyke
and
see
that
the
woman
do
take
a
crack
at
us
with
a
shotgun
she
do
it
in
a
minute
as
his
companion
darted
back
into
the
roadway
the
speaker
turned
to
his
captive
where
your
gun
by
this
time
anderson
crow
was
on
his
feet
he
was
clutching
something
in
his
hand
he
looked
at
it
in
stark
astonishment
it
was
an
automatic
pistol
in
raising
himself
from
the
ground
his
hand
had
fallen
upon
it
i
do
know
said
the
captive
sullenly
then
his
gaze
fell
upon
the
gaunt
figure
of
anderson
crow
a
frightful
scowl
transfigured
his
face
crow
involuntarily
drew
back
a
step
and
reversed
the
pistol
in
his
hand
so
that
its
muzzle
was
pointing
at
the
enemy
instead
of
at
himself
between
imprecations
the
prisoner
managed
to
convey
the
fact
that
he
realized
for
the
first
time
that
it
was
a
human
being
and
not
a
log
that
had
brought
him
to
earth
crow
found
his
voice
and
some
of
his
wits
at
the
same
time
i
learn
you
not
to
go
rampagin
around
these
parts
concealed
weapons
you
scamp
i
got
your
gun
blast
ye
he
turned
triumphantly
to
the
surprised
man
i
took
it
away
from
him
soon
as
i
had
him
down
an
holy
mackerel
gasped
the
operative
did
did
you
head
him
off
and
and
down
him
you
well
i
be
hanged
i
sorter
knowed
he
strike
about
here
tryin
to
make
the
woods
up
yonder
so
i
hustled
down
here
to
head
him
off
while
you
fellers
never
mind
now
broke
in
the
other
tell
it
to
me
later
come
on
both
of
you
we
not
through
yet
he
urged
the
burly
captive
through
the
hedge
marshal
crow
followed
very
close
behind
they
found
a
terrified
excited
group
on
the
front
porch
three
sturdy
females
in
nightgowns
all
with
their
hands
up
below
revealed
by
the
light
streaming
through
the
open
door
stood
a
man
covering
them
with
a
revolver
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
later
crow
dug
the
shivering
eliphalet
loop
out
of
the
and
ordered
him
forthwith
to
join
his
family
in
the
kitchen
where
he
would
hear
something
to
his
advantage
the
happiest
man
in
bramble
county
was
eliphalet
loop
when
he
finally
grasped
the
truth
the
prisoner
turned
out
to
be
his
wife
first
husband
he
grasped
that
fact
some
little
time
before
he
realized
that
was
even
her
second
husband
owing
to
certain
fundamental
principles
in
law
and
a
fugitive
from
justice
the
man
was
an
escaped
convict
the
leader
of
a
gang
of
counterfeiters
and
he
was
serving
a
term
in
one
of
the
federal
prisons
when
he
succeeded
in
his
break
for
liberty
for
many
months
the
united
states
secret
service
operatives
had
been
combing
the
country
for
him
hot
and
cold
on
his
trail
but
always
until
now
finding
themselves
baffled
by
the
crafty
rogue
who
according
to
the
records
was
one
of
the
most
dangerous
desperate
criminals
alive
finally
they
got
track
of
his
wife
who
had
lived
for
a
time
in
hoboken
but
it
was
only
within
the
week
that
they
succeeded
in
locating
her
as
the
wife
of
eliphalet
loop
the
remainder
of
the
story
is
too
simple
to
bother
about
of
course
loop
said
one
of
the
men
you
can
prosecute
this
woman
for
bigamy
loop
shook
his
head
not
much
i
wo
take
no
chance
she
might
prove
that
she
was
ever
married
to
feller
an
then
where
would
i
be
no
sirree
you
take
her
along
an
lock

a
dangerous
character

next
evening

on
the
porch
in
front
of
lamson
store
his

paying
up
more
promptly
than
he
had
expected
practically
of
the
reward

in
his
coat
pockets
all
silver
but
as
heavy
as
lead
yes
sir
he
was
saying
in
a
rather
voice
for
the
outer
rim
of
the
crowd
was
some
distance
away
as
i
said
before
several
times
i
figgered
he
would
do
just
what
he
did
i
figgered
that
i
have
to
outfigger
him
he
is
one
of
the
slickest
individuals
i
have
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
an
one
of
the
most
desperit
i
er
where
was
i
at
alf
oh
yes
i
recollect
he
was
a
powerful
feller
fer
a
second

the
best
of

revolver
besides
but
i
hung
on
like

of
the
month

just
as

the
men
came
dashin
up
an
what

deacon
well
if
the
rest
of
the
crowd
ai
tired
o
hearin
the
story
i
do
mind
tellin
it
all
over
harry
squires
perched
on
the
railing
assured
him
that
the
crowd
would
mind
in
the
least
the
real
beauty
of
the
story
anderson
he
added
dryly
is
that
it
has
so
much
of
the
spice
of
life
in
it
what
that
i
mean
variety
no
questions
answered
reward
for
the
apprehension
or
capture
of
person
or
persons
who
successfully
stole
the
fashionable
bulldog
belonging
to
fryback
on
or
about
friday
of
last
week
n
said
dog
occasionally
answers
to
the
name
of
marmaduke
but
mostly
to
mike
an
additional
reward
of
three
dollars
cash
will
be
paid
for
the
return
of
said
dog
with
or
without
said
criminals
no
questions
asked
a
crow
marshal
of
tinkletown
the
foregoing
poster
fresh
from
the
press
of
the
printing
office
made
itself
conspicuous
at
no
less
than
a
dozen
points
in
the
village
of
tinkletown
on
a
blustery
february
morning
early
visitors
to
the
post
office
in
lamson
store
were
the
first
to
discover
it
tacked
neatly
on
the
bulletin
board
others
saw
it
in
front
of
the
town
hall
while
others
who
rarely
took
the
trouble
to
look
at
a
telephone
pole
before
leaning
against
it
found
themselves
gazing
with
interest
at
the
notice
that
covered
the
customary
admonition
post
no
bills
of
course
every
one
in
tinkletown
knew
and
had
known
for
the
matter
of
a
week
or
more
that
mort
fryback
bulldog
was
lost
strayed
or
stolen
but
this
was
the
first
glaring
intimation
that
mort
had
also
lost
his
mind
in
the
first
place
mike
as
he
was
familiarly
known
to
every
inhabitant
was
worth
more
than
a
dollar
and
a
half
when
he
was
in
his
prime
and
that
according
to
recollection
must
have
been
at
least
twelve
or
fifteen
years
prior
to
his
unexplained
disappearance
in
the
second
place
it
was
pretty
generally
understood
that
mike
recently
marmaduke
had
surreptitiously
taken
a
dose
of
prussic
acid
in
a
shed
back
of
kepsal
blacksmith
shop
and
was
now
enjoying
a
state
of
perfect
rejuvenation
in
the
happy
hunting
ground
alf
reesling
the
town
drunkard
after
having
scanned
four
of
the
notices
on
his
way
to
the
post
office
informed
a
group
of
citizens
in
front
of
brubaker
drugstore
that
anderson
crow
would
do
almost
anything
to
get
his
name
into
print
alf
and
the
town
marshal
had
had
one
of
their
periodical
fallings
out
and
for
the
moment
at
least
the
former
was
inclined
to
bitterness
to
begin
with
explained
alf
there
ai
a
dog
in
this
town
worth
stealin
to
say
nothin
of
three
dollars
you
ca
tell
me
that
mort
fryback
would
give
three
dollars
to
get
that
dog
back
not
even
if
he
was
alive
which
he
ai
if
you
believe
bill
kepsal
no
sir
it
just
because
anderson
wants
to
see
his
name
in
print
that
what
it
is
i
bet
if
you
was
to
ask
mort
if
he
has
agreed
to
pay
how
much
is
it
all
told
dollars
if
he
has
agreed
to
pay
all
that
money
for
he
order
you
out
of
his
store
fryback
told
my
wife
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
that
marmaduke
was
a
prize
bull
and
she
would
take
a
hundred
dollars
for
him
said
newt
spratt
seems
that
she
had
somebody
look
up
his
pedigree
and
he
turns
out
to
be
a
stepson
or
something
like
that
of
a
dog
that
won
first
prize
at
a
bench
show
whatever
that
is
in
new
york
city
ever
since
that
actress
woman
was
here
last
fall
that
friend
of
harry
squires
i
mean
every
derned
dog
in
town
has
turned
out
to
be
related
some
way
or
other
to
a
thoroughbred
animal
in
some
other
city
said
alf
why
even
that
mangy
shepherd
dog
of
deacon
rank
accordin
to
rank
is
a
direct
descendant
of
two
of
the
finest
boston
terriers
that
ever
came
out
of
boston
she
told
me
so
herself
but
of
course
i
could
ask
how
he
happened
to
look
so
much
like
a
shepherd
dog
and
so
little
like
his
parents
there
no
use
makin
poor
rank
any
more
miserable
than
she
already
is
she
certainly
do
get
any
fun
out
of
life
livin
with
the
deacon
from
one
year
end
to
the
other
yes
sir
just
because
that
actress
woman
paraded
around
here
for
a
month
or
so
last
fall
with
a
french
poodle
is
no
reason
far
as
i
can
see
why
all
the
women
in
town
should
begin
puttin
leashes
on
their
dogs
and
washin
and
trimmin
and
tying
red
ribbons
around
their
necks
yes
and
around
some
of
their
tails
too
i
never
forget
that
dog
of
angie
nixon
going
around
with
a
blue
bow
straight
up
behind
him
and
lookin
as
though
he
lost
something
and
got
dizzy
looking
for
it
and
mort
dog
mike
poor
old
mike
why
he
got
so
he
go
down
to
hawkins
undertakin
shop
every
time
he
could
get
a
minute
off
and
bark
till
lem
would
let
him
in
and
then
he
lay
down
in
a
corner
and
go
to
sleep
and
lem
always
swore
the
poor
dog
was
as
mad
as
a
hornet
when
he
woke
up
and
found
he
was
still
alive
what
puzzles
me
is
why
mort
fryback
offerin
this
reward
and
all
that
if
he
knows
the
dog
is
dead
it
costs
money
to
have
bills
like
this
printed
at
the
office
so
spoke
elmer
pratt
the
photographer
was
he
present
at
the
obsequies
no
he
was
said
alf
he
claims
now
that
he
do
know
anything
about
it
and
besides
bill
kepsal
says
he
beat
the
head
off
of
anybody
that
says
mike
passed
away
on
his
premises
including
mort
so
naturally
mort
denies
it
he
told
me
yesterday
he
would
deny
it
even
if
he
had
both
of
his
legs
but
what
chance
says
he
has
a
man
got
with
big
bill
kepsal
here
comes
anderson
now
said
spratt
his
gaze
fixed
on
an
approaching
figure
it
was
zero
weather
in
northern
new
york
state
and
the
ancient
marshal
of
tinkletown
was
garbed
accordingly
the
expansive
collar
of
his
ulster
was
turned
up
completely
obscuring
the
and
part
of
the
coonskin
cap
he
was
wearing
an
enormous
pair
of
arctics
covered
his
feet
his
grey
and
red
mittens
were
of
the
homemade
variety
a
muffler
of
the
same
material
enveloped
his
gaunt
neck
knotted
loosely
under
his
chin
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
his
whiskers
free
not
only
to
the
wind
but
to
the
vicissitudes
of
conversation
as
well
the
emblem
of
authority
a
bright
silver
star
gleamed
on
the
breast
of
his
ulster
he
stopped
when
he
reached
the
group
huddled
in
front
of
the
drugstore
and
glared
accusingly
at
alf
reesling
i
thought
i
told
you
to
keep
off
the
streets
he
said
ominously
did
i
tell
you
yesterday
i
run
you
in
if
i
caught
you
drunk
in
the
streets
again
yes
you
did
replied
alf
in
a
justifiably
bellicose
manner
but
i
still
stick
to
what
i
said
to
you
at
first
when
you
said
that
to
me
what
was
that
i
said
you
could
ketch
me
even
if
i
was
dead
drunk
and
unconscious
in
the
gutter
that
what
i
said
for
two
cents
i
show
you
said
anderson
well
go
ahead
just
add
two
cents
to
what
you
claim
i
already
owe
you
and
go
ahead
with
your
runnin
me
in
but
before
you
do
it
lem
me
warn
you
i
sue
you
for
false
arrest
and
then
where
you
be
i
got
five
witnesses
right
here
that
swear
i
ai
drunk
now
and
have
been
in
years
that
shows
just
how
drunk
you
are
said
anderson
triumphantly
far
as
i
can
see
there
are
only
four
men
here
do
you
call
yourself
a
man
what
say
i
mean
i
got
five
witnesses
includin
you
that
what
i
mean
gettin
sick
of
you
all
the
time
tellin
me
i
been
drinkin
again
when
you
know
i
ai
touched
a
drop
since
why
you
andy
crow
if
it
was
for
me
an
the
way
you
keep
on
talkin
about
me
you
would
have
any
excuse
at
all
fer
bein
town
marshal
you
that
do
now
interrupted
anderson
severely
you
have
said
them
very
words
to
me
a
thousand
times
alf
reesling
and
who
that
coming
out
of
the
post
office
the
group
gradually
turned
to
look
up
the
street
tinkletown
is
a
slow
place
its
inhabitants
do
everything
with
a
deliberation
that
suggests
the
profoundest
ennui
for
example
a
gentleman
of
tinkletown
rarely
raised
his
hat
on
meeting
a
lady
he
invariably
started
to
do
so
but
as
the
ladies
of
the
place
were
in
the
habit
of
moving
with
more
celerity
than
the
gentlemen
he
failed
on
most
occasions
to
complete
the
undertaking
what
the
sense
of
takin
your
hat
off
to
a
woman
he
would
argue
if
she
already
got
past
you
so
far
as
anybody
knew
there
was
a
woman
in
town
with
an
eye
in
the
back
of
her
head
looks
like
a
stranger
said
newt
spratt
it
certainly
does
agreed
anderson
yes
i
right
he
added
an
instant
later
the
object
of
interest
was
crossing
the
street
in
the
direction
of
the
grand
view
hotel
the
group
watched
him
with
mild
interest
in
front
of
the
frame
building
that
seemed
to
stagger
or
at
least
to
shrink
under
the
weight
of
its
own
importance
the
stranger
a
man
paused
to
glance
at
one
of
the
placards
heralding
the
misfortune
and
at
the
same
time
the
far
from
parsimonious
regard
of
the
lady
who
had
been
despoiled
of
a
fashionable
bulldog
having
perused
the
singularly
comprehensive
notice
he
deliberately
tore
it
down
folded
it
with
some
care
and
stuck
it
into
his
overcoat
pocket
then
he
entered
the
grand
view
hotel
well
i
be
exclaimed
marshal
crow
reesling
animosity
gave
way
to
civic
pride
by
jingo
anderson
he
cried
if
you
want
any
help
arrestin
that
scoundrel
call
on
me
comin
around
here
defacin
things
like
that
he
ought
to
go
to
jail
elmer
pratt
the
photographer
voiced
a
but
fruitless
criticism
if
you
paste
up
instead
of
tackin
up
people
could
take
down
like
that
i
told
you
if
you
got
any
complaints
to
make
about
me
elmer
you
better
make
to
the
town
board
and
not
to
alf
reesling
and
newt
spratt
interrupted
marshal
crow
testily
besides
i
do
paste
up
when
i
run
out
of
tacks
he
started
off
toward
the
grand
view
his
head
erect
his
whiskers
bristling
with
indignation
shall
we
go
with
you
anderson
inquired
alf
necessary
replied
the
marshal
but
you
might
go
over
and
wait
for
me
in
front
of
the
hotel
if
you
need
any
help
just
holler
said
alf
entering
the
office
of
the
grand
view
hotel
marshal
crow
looked
around
for
the
despoiler
save
for
the
presence
of
the
proprietress
bloomer
relict
of
the
founder
of
the
hostelry
the
room
was
quite
empty
bloomer
however
filled
it
rather
snugly
she
was
a
large
person
and
she
had
a
cold
in
the
head
which
made
her
feel
even
larger
she
was
now
engaged
in
sweeping
the
floor
mornin
jennie
was
anderson
greeting
where
the
feller
stoppin
here
bloomer
had
the
sniffles
he
gone
up
to
his
room
she
said
then
after
another
sniffle
why
i
want
to
see
him
well
his
room
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
to
your
right
anderson
twisted
his
whiskers
in
momentary
perplexity
might
be
better
if
you
asked
him
to
come
down
ask
him
yourself
she
said
i
do
want
to
see
him
marshal
crow
made
a
mental
reservation
to
yank
bloomer
up
before
justice
robb
the
next
time
she
left
the
garbage
can
standing
on
the
sidewalk
overnight
he
hesitated
about
going
up
to
the
guest
bedroom
it
was
quite
the
legal
thing
to
do
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
longer
he
hesitated
in
fact
while
he
was
about
it
he
thought
he
would
draw
a
chair
up
to
the
big
stove
and
sit
down
wo
you
take
off
your
overcoat
and
goloshes
inquired
the
landlady
but
in
a
far
from
hospitable
manner
how
long
has
this
feller
been
here
demanded
anderson
moving
his
left
foot
a
little
but
not
quite
far
enough
to
avoid
the
broom
last
night
what
his
name
and
where
he
from
go
and
look
at
the
register
and
then
you
know
as
much
as
i
do
a
public
register
nothing
secret
about
it
anderson
got
up
suddenly
i
guess
i
go
look
while
you
around
here
the
register
on
the
little
counter
in
the
corner
revealed
the
name
of
a
single
arrival
below
the
flowing
spencerian
hand
of
willie
spence
the
clerk
head
waiter
porter
and
of
the
grand
view
hotel
willie
because
of
his
proficiency
as
a
chirographer
always
wrote
the
date
line
in
the
register
he
was
strong
on
flourishes
but
somewhat
feeble
in
spelling
any
one
with
half
an
eye
could
see
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
a
date
line
that
read
febury
the
lone
name
written
in
a
tight
running
hand
with
total
disregard
for
the
elementary
formation
of
letters
might
have
been
almost
anything
that
occupied
less
than
two
inches
of
space
even
his
place
of
residence
was
a
matter
of
doubt
the
marshal
put
on
his
spectacles
and
studied
the
signature
as
far
as
he
could
make
out
the
man
name
was
something
like
winnumnn
millmmmln
it
was
a
name
that
baffled
him
the
longer
he
studied
it
the
worse
it
became
seems
to
me
jennie
if
i
was
runnin
this
hotel
i
have
willie
spence
register
for
the
guests
and
save
the
trouble
ca
you
make
it
out
course
i
can
he
replied
promptly
it
as
plain
as
day
to
me
but
i
bet
you
a
good
cigar
you
ca
make
it
out
she
fell
into
the
trap
all
right
i
take
you
up
it
george
f
fox
crow
stared
at
her
for
a
second
or
two
then
he
recovered
himself
you
right
he
said
what
kind
of
a
cigar
do
you
smoke
jennie
as
he
had
feared
she
promptly
named
the
cigar
she
had
in
stock
a
brand
and
then
coolly
announced
that
if
he
leave
a
dime
on
the
show
case
she
get
it
got
his
wife
with
him
i
see
remarked
anderson
yep
said
bloomer
what
his
business
i
asked
him
last
night
said
she
pausing
in
her
work
to
fix
anderson
with
a
rather
penetrating
look
he
said
he
was
a
trained
elephant
a
a
what
a
trained
elephant
you
do
say
so
and
his
wife
is
a
she
added
uneasily
anderson
blinked
rapidly
well
of
all
the
but
what
on
earth
he
doing
here
in
tinkletown
i
did
ask
any
more
questions
after
that
said
she
with
a
furtive
glance
up
the
stairway
i
give
a
good
deal
to
know
what
they
got
in
them
big
black
valises
they
brought
with
three
times
as
big
as
regular
valises
with
brass
trimmin
i
hope
she
aint
got
any
reptiles
in
marshal
crow
took
that
instant
to
consult
the
office
clock
by
ginger
he
exclaimed
with
some
sprightliness
i
got
to
be
movin
along
follerin
up
a
clue
in
that
dog
case
bloomer
anxious
gaze
was
bent
on
a
dark
corner
back
of
the
stairway
i
do
hope
if
she
got
any
snakes
in
them
valises
she
wo
let
get
loose
and
go
crawlin
all
over
the
place
i
crow
sent
a
quick
searching
look
about
the
office
as
he
strode
toward
the
door
ai
you
going
up
to
his
room
inquired
bloomer
not
just
now
replied
anderson
and
closed
the
door
quickly
behind
him
alf
reesling
and
his
companions
were
waiting
impatiently
on
the
sidewalk
they
were
actively
disappointed
when
the
marshal
emerged
was
he
too
much
fer
you
was
alf
scathing
inquiry
how
many
times
have
i
got
to
tell
you
alf
that
i
able
to
deduce
these
cases
without
your
assistance
now
this
is
a
big
case
and
you
leave
it
to
me
to
handle
when
i
get
ready
to
act
you
hear
something
that
will
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
hold
on
newt
do
ask
any
questions
do
i
was
going
to
ask
any
questions
snapped
newt
i
was
going
to
tell
you
something
you
was
eh
well
what
was
you
going
to
tell
me
mort
fryback
went
by
here
a
couple
of
minutes
ago
an
he
says
for
you
to
come
into
his
store
right
away
anderson
frowned
i
bet
he
confessed
who
him
what
he
got
to
confess
demanded
alf
never
mind
never
mind
said
the
marshal
quickly
i
step
in
and
see
him
now
leaving
his
reserves
standing
in
front
of
the
grand
view
crow
hurried
into
fryback
hardware
store
mort
was
pacing
or
strictly
speaking
stumping
back
and
forth
behind
the
cutlery
counter
his
brow
was
corrugated
with
anxiety
the
instant
he
saw
the
marshal
he
uttered
an
exclamation
that
might
have
been
construed
as
either
relief
dismay
or
wrath
it
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
inarticulate
and
therefore
extremely
difficult
to
classify
anderson
however
deduced
it
as
dismay
fryback
came
out
from
behind
the
counter
stumped
over
to
the
stove
in
which
there
was
a
crackling
fire
and
after
opening
the
isinglass
door
squirted
a
mouthful
of
tobacco
juice
upon
the
coals
whereupon
it
became
possible
for
him
to
articulate
i
been
lookin
everywhere
fer
you
said
he
somewhat
breathlessly
where
you
been
to
business
retorted
anderson
what
the
matter
fryback
took
the
precaution
to
ascertain
that
there
were
no
listeners
in
the
store
somebody
some
woman
you
bet
on
that
told
my
wife
last
night
that
i
poisoned
old
mike
well
you
did
did
you
of
course
i
did
that
is
i
hired
charlie
brubaker
to
do
it
but
she
says
i
did
it
with
my
own
hands
and
my
gosh
anderson
i
never
went
through
such
a
night
in
my
life
as
last
night
he
mopped
his
brow
you
think
i
was
a
murderer
course
i
denied
it
i
swore
he
dead
and
that
i
increase
the
reward
to
a
hundred
dollars
just
to
show
her
what
i
want
you
to
do
right
away
is
to
have
a
new
set
of
bills
printed
offerin
a
hundred
dollars
reward
for
that
dog
instead
of
three
it
the
only
chance
i
got
of
ever
being
able
to
live
in
my
own
house
again
the
marshal
eyed
him
reflectively
if
you
could
get
her
to
agree
to
let
you
offer
the
reward
for
mike
dead
or
alive
she
wants
him
alive
and
no
other
way
ca
you
buy
her
off
fryback
groaned
i
could
he
began
dismally
and
then
fell
to
chewing
with
great
vigour
what
would
it
cost
inquired
anderson
feelingly
an
automobile
replied
fryback
after
opening
and
closing
the
once
more
it
would
be
cheaper
you
see
to
offer
a
hundred
dollars
for
mike
he
explained
ingenuously
it
certainly
would
agreed
the
marshal
seein
as
you
would
have
to
pay
fer
anything
except
the
printin
of
the
notices
if
you
wanted
to
show
how
much
you
think
of
your
wife
and
how
anxious
you
are
to
please
her
you
could
go
as
high
as
a
thousand
dollars
mort
would
you
reely
anderson
sure
she
could
lord
it
over
all
these
women
includin
my
wife
been
sayin
mike
was
worth
fifty
cents
and
did
have
a
pedigree
any
longer
than
his
tail
why
if
she
wanted
to
go
on
lyin
about
the
value
of
that
old
dog
she
could
tell
people
she
had
been
offered
a
thousand
dollars
for
marmyduke
by
a
dog
collector
in
new
york
that
please
her
reflected
mort
course
this
thing
has
already
cost
me
quite
a
lot
of
money
outside
the
printin
i
had
to
give
bill
kepsal
a
receipt
in
full
fer
what
he
owes
me
and
that
young
brubaker
been
in
twice
to
price
stoves
he
says
if
he
get
a
good
one
fer
ten
dollars
he
take
it
and
his
heart
seems
to
be
set
on
that
regal
over
yonder
i
in
an
awful
fix
anderson
well
you
ca
say
i
did
advise
you
to
let
mike
die
a
natural
death
i
wish
to
goodness
i
had
lamented
mort
the
door
opened
at
that
juncture
and
in
walked
a
man
and
a
woman
the
former
was
carrying
a
square
black
valise
inadequately
described
by
bloomer
as
twice
the
natural
size
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
more
like
a
trunk
to
quote
no
less
an
authority
than
the
town
marshal
the
proprietor
of
the
hardware
store
was
at
a
glance
qualified
to
pass
an
opinion
on
the
personal
appearance
of
the
two
strangers
his
companion
attention
however
was
devoted
so
earnestly
to
the
big
black
valise
that
he
could
have
told
for
the
life
of
him
whether
the
customers
were
young
or
old
black
or
white
his
fascinated
gaze
was
riveted
upon
the
object
the
man
deposited
carefully
on
the
floor
near
the
door
you
are
a
locksmith
i
perceive
remarked
the
strange
man
addressing
mort
i
like
to
have
you
see
if
you
can
open
this
box
for
me
lost
or
mislaid
the
key
what
fer
sort
of
a
lock
is
it
asked
mort
approaching
hold

mort
called
out
crow
do
monkey
with
that
trunk
illustration
hold
on
mort
called
out
crow
do
monkey
with
that
trunk
the
two
strangers
turned
on
him
well
who
the
deuce
have
we
here
said
the
man
with
some
acerbity
oh
what
a
nice
old
policeman
cried
the
lady
fixing
the
marshal
with
a
pair
of
intensely
blue
eyes
crow
looked
at
her
in
amazement
could
any
one
as
pretty
as
dainty
and
as
as
she
be
engaged
in
the
awful
business
of
charming
snakes
before
we
go
any
further
mister
i
got
to
know
what
inside
that
box
said
anderson
firmly
what
the
matter
with
you
demanded
the
other
there
nothing
in
it
that
need
excite
the
law
my
good
man
this
is
our
town
marshal
anderson
crow
explained
mort
fryback
i
might
have
known
it
said
the
stranger
i
heard
a
good
deal
about
crow
well
what
the
answer
that
what
i
want
to
know
snapped
anderson
what
is
the
answer
what
kind
are
they
and
how
many
have
you
got
the
stranger
was
on
the
point
of
exploding
with
indignation
when
his
fair
companion
intervened
leave
it
to
me
george
dear
you
always
fly
into
such
a
temper
if
you
only
let
me
attend
to
the
small
things
while
you
look
out
for
the
big
ones
we
get
along
so
much
better
would
we
mr
crow
she
appealed
to
crow
so
abruptly
and
so
sweetly
that
he
said
he
guessed
so
before
he
could
check
himself
if
you
will
stay
here
until
we
find
a
key
that
will
fit
crow
you
will
see
with
your
own
eyes
what
will
make
them
pop
out
of
your
head
mort
you
keep
away
from
that
box
i
say
commanded
anderson
now
sure
of
his
ground
do
you
want
to
get
bit
oh
dear
me
they
wo
bite
you
cried
the
young
lady
i
promise
you
they
are
most
amiable
i
have
been
handling
them
for
several
weeks
and
her
husband
interrupted
her
he
revealed
symptoms
of
increasing
annoyance
see
here
let
get
busy
and
open
this
thing
they
got
to
be
fed
you
know
and
it
all
damned
poppycock
discussing
the
matter
any
longer
marshal
crow
held
up
his
hand
as
if
stopping
traffic
in
main
street
you
are
in
the
presence
of
the
law
wolf
he
began
the
young
woman
giggled
he
glared
at
her
my
name
is
fox
said
the
young
man
curtly
that
do
make
any
difference
retorted
the
marshal
mine
crow
and
i
represent
the
law
you
how
delicious
said
fox
so
like
that
cunning
poem
of
guy
wetmore
carryl
you
know
it
of
course
mr
crow
she
declaimed
blush
to
add
that
when
the
bird
took
in
the
situation
he
said
one
brief
emphatic
word
unfit
for
publication
the
fox
was
greatly
startled
but
he
only
sighed
and
answered
tut
do
be
silly
bess
said
her
husband
this
is
no
time
to
recite
poetry
i
do
see
any
sense
in
it
anyhow
said
marshal
crow
fryback
emerged
from
behind
the
cutlery
counter
whither
he
had
repaired
in
some
haste
when
it
became
evident
that
fox
was
likely
to
remain
for
some
time
he
was
wiping
his
lips
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
what
very
recently
might
have
been
mistaken
for
a
prodigious
swelling
in
his
cheek
had
strangely
subsided
why
should
i
fit
a
key
to
that
lock
andy
he
demanded
rather
hotly
what
right
have
you
got
to
interfere
with
my
business
the
marshal
lips
parted
to
utter
a
sharp
retort
but
the
words
failed
to
issue
young
fox
suddenly
stooped
over
and
peered
intently
at
several
heretofore
unnoticed
holes
at
one
end
of
the
black
box
these
holes
about
an
inch
in
diameter
formed
a
horizontal
row
much
to
crow
alarm
the
young
lady
pulled
off
her
glove
and
stuck
a
finger
into
one
of
the
little
apertures
and
apparently
wriggled
it
without
fear
or
trepidation
almost
instantly
there
was
an
ominous
rustling
inside
the
box
withdrawing
her
finger
she
called
out
please
look
the
invitation
was
unnecessary
crow
was
looking
for
all
he
was
worth
good
gracious
he
gasped
do
stir
up
like
that
next
thing
they
crawl
out
of
them
holes
and
why
you
poor
old
goose
she
said
but
not
disrespectfully
much
too
large
to
crawl
through
these
holes
i
wish
i
could
catch
hold
of
one
of
their
tails
and
look
she
held
her
finger
close
to
the
hole
and
a
long
thin
black
tongue
darted
through
and
began
to
writhe
about
in
a
most
malevolent
manner
for
gosh
sake
exclaimed
the
marshal
retreating
a
couple
of
steps
this
sudden
action
on
his
part
brought
a
venomous
oath
from
fryback
and
an
instant
apology
as
well
you
cuss
too
explained
the
blasphemer
to
the
lady
if
a
clumsy
elephant
stepped
on
the
only
good
foot
you
got
if
you
think
i
the
one
that
claims
to
be
an
elephant
began
anderson
cootchy
cootchy
cootchy
cooed
the
lady
addressing
the
row
of
holes
whereupon
the
rustling
in
the
interior
of
the
devilish
box
increased
to
a
turmoil
the
two
citizens
of
tinkletown
stared
at
the
three
little
circles
and
their
eyes
grew
wider
as
they
saw
that
one
of
them
was
now
completely
stopped
up
by
a
dark
ugly
object
that
bore
resemblance
to
nothing
they
had
ever
seen
before
a
wet
shiny
thing
that
was
alive
and
quivering
the
unnatural
fox
promptly
poked
her
finger
through
the
hole
and
rubbed
the
snout
of
what
must
have
been
a
instantly
to
their
horror
the
black
obstruction
went
through
a
process
of
splitting
and
several
deadly
fangs
were
revealed
once
more
the
wriggling
black
tongue
darted
out
to
caress
the
lady
unprotected
finger
oh
you
darling
cried
the
lady
please
locksmith
see
if
you
ca
find
a
key
that
will
fit
the
lock
marshal
crow
dragged
his
friend
toward
the
door
did
you
see
it
he
whispered
hoarsely
before
mort
could
answer
the
door
flew
open
and
in
rushed
bloomer
bareheaded
and
in
a
great
state
of
agitation
for
heaven
sake
anderson
hurry
up
and
come
with
me
she
cried
bring
a
pistol
and
mort
you
get
a
couple
of
axes
and
a
pitchfork
or
two
my
god
something
awful
is
loose
in
one
of
them
rooms
upstairs
the
most
terrible
racket
is
going
on
in
there
i
oh

she
caught

of
her
lodgers

them
anderson
lock
them
up
at
once
they
dangerous
people
they
ought
to
be
running
at
large
oh
that
awful
thing
it
sounds
like
it
was
twenty
feet
long
and
thrashing
all
over
the
room
oh
my
god
what
a
scare
i
had
oh

at
me

like

door
of
that
room
is
locked
but
goodness
knows
how
soon
it
will
be
crawlin
through
the
transom
at
that
instant
she
discovered
that
her
skirt
was
almost
touching
the
big
black
box
on
the
floor
emitting
a
sharp
squeal
she
gave
an
elephantine
leap
to
the
shelter
of
anderson
arms
almost
bowling
him
over
god
knows
what
she
got
in
that
valise
she
whimpered
fox
put
on
an
exceedingly
bold
front
realizing
that
he
was
cornered
he
adopted
a
lightly
boastful
air
what
we
got
in
this
valise
as
you
call
it
madam
is
worth
more
than
your
whole
blamed
hotel
keep
away
from
that
valise
warned
anderson
crow
addressing
fox
give
me
time
to
think
somethin
got
to
be
done
and
right
away
i
ca
take
any
chances
of
these
terrible
things
gettin
loose
drivin
our
citizens
out
of
town
the
first
thing
you
got
to
do
anderson
crow
shouted
bloomer
is
to
capture
the
reptile
that

in
my
hotel
that
what
you
got
to
do
she
turned
upon
the
pretty
fox
snake

that
a
nice
business
for
a
woman
to
be
in
do
come
near

i
am
not

of
coming
near

you
old
rip
said
fox
losing
her
temper
in
a
very
womanly
fashion
none
o
that
now
none
o
that
warned
the
town
marshal
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
your
head
young
woman
why
you
old
began
the
lady
but
her
husband
spared
the
marshal
a
whirlwind
of
revelations
by
taking
her
arm
and
leading
her
to
the
rear
of
the
store
where
for
some
minutes
they
were
in
close
and
earnest
conference
the
thing
to
do
said
mort
fryback
is
to
take
this
box
down
to
the
crick
an
drop
it
in
all
locked
and
everything
that
will
put
an
end
to
the
cussed
things
any
other
way
i
know
a
furious
commotion
took
place
inside
the
box
preventing
further
discussion
on
the
part
of
the
retreating
observers
it
was
as
if
a
dozen
huge
and
powerful
serpents
were
exerting
every
effort
to
escape
the
voice
of
fox
clear
as
a
bell
assailed
them
from
behind
they
hungry
poor
things
she
cried
perfectly
ravenous
that
settles
it
said
marshal
crow
we
got
to
git
rid
of
if
we
have
to
set
fire
to
your
store
mort
they
terrible
when

fed
fer
a
long
time
swaller
pigs
an
sheep
children
whole
they
say
fox
approached
he
was
now
very
polite
and
ingratiating
permit
me
he
observed
to
offer
a
solution
if
you
will
give
me
a
bunch
of
keys
my
friend
i
will
remove
the
case
to
my
room
and
open
it
if
possible
no
harm
will
come
to
anybody
and
in
one
hour
or
so
my
wife
and
i
will
be
on
our
way
my
automobile
is
in
your
local
garage

and
we
can
be
ready
to
start
as
soon
as
we
have
fed
and
aired
the
er
shall
we
say
contents
you
arrest
him
anderson
cried
bloomer
hold
him
till
i
estimate
the
damage
that
been
done
to
my
property
he
got
to
pay
fer
that
before
he
can
get
out
of
this
town
i
guess
you
better
step
over
to
the
calaboose
with
me
mister
said
anderson
firmly
and
you
too
this
here
lady
prefers
charges
against
you
an
it
my
duty
to
what
is
the
charge
madam
demanded
fox
lighting
a
cigarette
never
mind
said
the
marshal
we
attend
to
that
later
fryback
put
in
a
word
at
this
point
yes
but
who
going
to
take
charge
of
this
here
box
it
ca
stay
here
in
my
place
first
thing
you
know
the
derned
things
will
gnaw
a
hole
in
the
side
and
git
out
if
it
is
not
too
far
mr
officer
i
should
be
happy
to
carry
the
box
over
to
the
unless
of
course
some
one
else
will
volunteer
i
see
quite
a
number
of
citizens
looking
in
through
the
window
doubtless
some
of
them
might
how
long
after
a
man
been
on
a
bad
spree
is
he
likely
to
think
he
sees
snakes
demanded
anderson
struck
with
an
idea
the
time
varies
replied
fox
rather
startled
alf
ai
been
tight
in
a
good
many
years
mused
the
marshal
i
guess
it
would
be
safe
to
let
him
carry
do
you
think
so
mort
him
and
newt
spratt
said
mort
newt
always
braggin
about
not
being
afraid
of
anything
well
perhaps
it
would
be
just
as
well
not
to
tell
what
in
this
here
box
said
anderson
he
turned
to
the
pair
of
strangers
only
they
ai
going
to
carry
it
to
the
calaboose
they
going
to
carry
it
to
the
crick
an
throw
it
in
the
young
woman
uttered
a
cry
of
dismay
and
her
husband
uttered
something
distinctly
out
of
place
for
bloomer
again
told
him
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
after
a
few
whispered
words
in
the
ear
of
the
distracted
young
woman
fox
turned
to
the
others
i
tell
you
what
we
do
gentlemen
said
he
and
then
added
with
a
polite
bow
to
the
corpulent
bloomer
and
ladies
fox
and
i
had
planned
giving
a
little
exhibition
at
the
hotel
but
that
now
seems
to
be
out
of
the
question
kindly
bear
in
mind
that
we
are
not
visiting
your
little
city
on
pleasure
bent
we
are
here
strictly
for
business
as
a
rule
we
do
not
make
stands
but
we
have
been
attracted
to
your
charming
city
almost
against
our
will
although
i
may
add
it
was
at
the
earnest
invitation
of
one
of
your
most
important
denizens
i
should
say
citizens
you
will
agree
i
am
sure
that
it
would
hardly
pay
us
to
visit
a
place
like
this
unless
we
were
reasonably
assured
of
something
in
the
way
of
pecuniary
benefits
you
may
not
know
it
gentlemen
but
we
have
had
a
offer
of
one
hundred
dollars
and
that
is
to
be
sneezed
at
is
it
we
please
bear
with
me
hawk
i
shall
not
detain
you
my
name
is
crow
snapped
anderson
sorry
apologized
fox
i
fear
i
confused
you
with
the
celebrated
hawkshaw
the
detective
crow
turned
purple
that
what
harry
squires
the
reporter
on
the
calls
him
most
of
the
time
volunteered
mort
fryback
that
an
shellback
holmes
such
is
fame
said
fox
agreeably
well
to
get
right
down
to
cases
fox
and
i
propose
that
you
allow
us
to
give
our
little
exhibition
in
the
town
hall
if
you
have
one
and
not
much
roared
anderson
i
had
enough
of
this
talk
i
going
to
take
action
at
once
he
flung
open
the
front
door
and
addressed
the
group
in
front
of
the
store
now
increased
to
nearly
a
score
including
several
scattered
women
and
children
and
ed
higgins
dog
i
call
on
all
you
men
to
assist
me
in
surrounding
the
grand
view
hotel
there
is
dangerous
work
ahead
and
i
want
only
the
bravest
wait
a
second
newt
do
go
away
and
most
determined
men
in
town
to
volunteer
here
mort
you
hand
out
some
axes
an
pitchforks
an
crowbars
an
oh
for
heaven
sake
george
cried
fox
frantically
do
let
them
do
it
stop
them
but
the
stranger
motioned
for
her
to
be
silent
some
time
was
spent
in
explaining
the
situation
to
the
posse
and
in
stationing
a
group
of
the
hardiest
men
beneath
certain
windows
of
the
second
floor
back
during
this
arrangement
of
forces
three
of
the
bravest
men
in
tinkletown
had
to
go
to
the
post
office
for
some
very
important
letters
and
two
more
rushed
over
to
see
that
they
came
back
anderson
crow
marshalled
a
dozen
or
more
conscripts
in
main
street
preparatory
to
a
frontal
attack
on
the
suite
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
he
had
commandeered
a
shotgun
belonging
to
bill
kepsal
and
with
this
he
proposed
to
shoot
the
daylights
out
of
the
serpent
through
the
transom
if
it
had
crawled
under
the
bed
where
he
could
get
a
bead
on
it
in
the
meantime
fox
had
carried
the
big
black
box
out
of
store
and
his
wife
was
now
standing
guard
over
it
on
the
porch
of
the
grand
view
hotel
illustration
wife
was
now
standing
guard
over
it
on
the
porch
of
the
grand
view
marshal
crow
was
issuing
commands
right
and
left
and
the
squad
augmented
by
a
from
the
hardware
shop
was
about
to
enter
the
hotel
when
fox
uttered
an
excited
little
shriek
and
then
these
desolating
words
oh
george
i
found
it
i
got
the
key
it
was
away
down
in
my
muff
before
any
action
could
be
taken
to
restrain
the
impetuous
young
woman
she
was
inserting
the
key
in
the
lock
those
nearest
her
collided
violently
with
those
farther
away
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
mention
it
there
was
no
one
within
a
radius
of
fifty
feet
except
a
new
arrival
on
the
scene
to
the
intense
horror
of
mort
fryback
his
wife
emerged
from
the
grand
view
hotel
and
entered
the
danger
zone
hey
maude
he
bellowed
keep
away
from
that
for
the
love
of
he
clapped
his
hand
over
his
eyes
fryback
had
reached
the
side
of
the
eager
fox
just
as
that
lady
lifted
the
lid
of
the
box
now
fryback
was
mort
third
wife
according
to
longevity
statistics
she
was
much
too
young
to
die
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
little
more
than
a
bride
that
probably
accounts
for
the
mink
coat
and
muff
she
was
sporting
moreover
it
accounts
for
surprising
mendacity
and
even
more
amazing
humility
in
relation
to
the
of
mike
no
doubt
in
similar
circumstances
he
would
have
told
his
second
wife
who
died
when
she
was
pretty
well
along
in
years
that
he
show
her
who
was
boss
in
his
home
and
if
she
did
like
what
he
did
to
mike
she
could
lump
it
but
alas
between
a
vacillating
young
wife
who
has
you
under
her
thumb
and
a
constant
old
one
who
has
been
thoroughly
squashed
under
yours
for
a
great
many
years
there
is
a
world
of
difference
others
who
stared
in
horror
at
the
picture
on
the
porch
groaned
audibly
as
young
fox
looked
up
into
the
face
of
the
unsuspecting
victim
and
smiled
thus
encouraged
young
fryback
disdaining
death
smiled
in
return
and
stooped
over
to
look
into
the
depths
of
that
unspeakable
box
instead
of
starting
back
in
alarm
she
uttered
a
shrill
little
cry
of
delight
and
dropping
to
her
knees
plunged
both
hands
into
the
nest
of
wriggling
horrors
lucius
fry
who
had
hastily
set
up
the
and
was
now
balancing
himself
somewhat
precariously
at
the
top
of
it
let
out
a
lugubrious
howl
she
a
goner
he
announced
the
two
young
women
had
their
heads
close
together
and
were
conversing
marshal
crow
armed
with
the
double
barreled
shotgun
began
a
cautious
circuitous
advance
his
finger
on
the
trigger
he
stopped
short
when
about
twenty
feet
from
the
women
and
spasmodically
pulled
the
trigger
there
is
no
telling
what
might
have
happened
if
the
gun
had
been
loaded
fox
had
deliberately
overturned
the
box
and
out
scampered
three
sprightly
boston
terrier
puppies
ten
minutes
later
all
but
one
of
mort
fryback
farming
utensils
were
back
in
stock
the
missing
implement
a
hatchet
was
furtively
on
its
way
to
the
of
one
ebenezer
january
coloured
and
fryback
marshal
crow
and
the
amiable
foxes
discussed
the
points
of
the
frolicsome
puppies
in
the
rear
of
the
hardware
store
i
just
adore
this
one
fox
said
fryback
pointing
to
a
rugged
little
rascal
who
was
patiently
gnawing
at
fryback
do
you
really
recommend
him
as
the
best
of
the
lot
mr
fox
she
inquired
turning
her
shining
eyes
upon
the
gentleman
absolutely
said
fox
would
you
say
so
mr
crow
said
anderson
then
i
take
him
said
mort
wife
and
mort
not
only
sighed
but
wiped
a
fine
coat
of
moisture
from
his
brow
one
hundred
dollars
is
the
very
least
you
will
take
the
very
least
fryback
he
is
a
thoroughbred
you
know
my
kennels
are
famous
as
you
doubtless
noted
in
my
advertisement
in
and
and
i
can
personally
guarantee
every
pup
that
comes
out
of
them
in
your
letter
to
me
fryback
you
stated
that
only
the
best
i
had
on
hand
would
be
considered
the
mother
of
these
puppies
has
a
pedigree
a
yard
long
and
the
father
as
i
mentioned
before
is
stubbs
the
twelfth
nothing
more
need
be
said
the
mother
bonnie
bridget
you
have
just
seen
stubbs
the
twelfth
belongs
to
a
millionaire
in
albany
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
madam
extending
his
hand
on
having
secured
one
of
the
finest
dogs
in
america
and
you
also
fryback
on
having
a
wife
who
is
such
a
discriminating
judge
of
thoroughbreds
fryback
looked
a
trifle
startled
but
said
nothing
if
you
ever
come
to
our
town
crow
i
hope
you
will
look
us
up
broke
in
fox
our
place
is
about
two
miles
out
in
the
country
by
the
way
has
crow
a
good
dog
i
mean
one
that
she
can
be
proud
of
she
has
a
thoroughbred
setter
said
marshal
crow
compressing
his
lips
a
hundred
dollars
is
a
lot
of
money
fer
a
dog
murmured
fryback
he
met
his
wife
eye
for
a
second
and
then
added
but
of
course
my
wife
has
just
lost
one
that
was
worth
a
thousand
dollars
so
i
guess
it
ai
so
much
after
all
marmaduke
was
a
really
wonderful
dog
fox
vouchsafed
wife
assuming
a
sad
and
pensive
expression
i
am
sure
he
must
have
been
said
fox
one
hundred
dollars
is
very
cheap
sir
for
a
thoroughbred
boston
terrier
in
these
days
said
fox
is
that
so
mr
crow
cheap
as
dirt
said
anderson
mortimer
will
you
please
give
fox
the
money
said
fryback
and
by
the
way
crow
i
hope
you
take
down
all
those
reward
notices
at
once
i
would
know
what
to
do
with
marmaduke
now
even
if
some
one
did
bring
him
back
to
me
i
know
what
i
order
you
to
do
with
him
said
anderson
meeting
mort
melancholy
gaze
at
last
what
may
i
inquire
i
order
you
to
bury
him
said
the
town
marshal
speaking
in
his
capacity
as
chairman
of
the
board
of
health
fryback
looked
at
him
steadily
for
a
second
or
two
and
then
slowly
closed
an
eye
shades
of
the
garden
of
eden
it
was
often
that
marshal
crow
acknowledged
that
he
was
in
a
quandary
when
he
find
himself
in
that
rare
state
of
mind
he
invariably
went
to
harry
squires
the
editor
of
the
for
counsel
but
never
for
advice
he
had
in
the
course
of
a
protracted
career
as
preserver
of
the
peace
and
dignity
of
tinkletown
found
himself
confronted
by
seemingly
unsolvable
mysteries
but
he
always
had
succeeded
in
unravelling
them
one
way
or
another
to
his
own
complete
satisfaction
only
the
grossest
impudence
on
the
part
of
the
present
chronicler
would
permit
the
tiniest
implication
to
creep
into
this
or
any
other
chapter
of
his
remarkable
history
that
might
lead
the
reader
to
suspect
that
he
did
not
solve
them
to
the
complete
satisfaction
of
any
one
else
so
quite
obviously
the
point
is
not
one
to
be
debated
now
as
nearly
every
one
knows
tinkletown
is
a
temperance
place
there
is
no
saloon
there
unless
of
course
one
chooses
to
be
rather
nasty
about
brubaker
drugstore
away
back
in
the
seventies
soon
after
the
civil
war
in
fact
an
enterprising
but
misguided
individual
attempted
to
establish
a
at
the
corner
of
main
and
sickle
streets
he
opened
the
sunlight
bar
and
for
one
whole
day
and
night
revelled
in
the
conviction
that
he
had
found
a
silver
mine
the
male
population
of
tinkletown
augmented
by
a
swarm
of
inebriates
from
all
the
farms
within
a
radius
of
ten
miles
flocked
to
the
sunlight
bar
and
proceeded
to
get
gloriously
and
collectively
drunk
on
the
contents
of
the
two
kegs
of
lager
beer
that
constituted
an
experimental
stock
in
trade
the
next
morning
the
women
of
tinkletown
started
in
to
put
the
sunlight
bar
out
of
business
they
did
not
as
you
may
suspect
hurl
stones
at
the
place
neither
did
they
feloniously
enter
and
wreak
destruction
with
axes
hatchets
and
not
a
bit
of
it
they
were
peaceful
women
not
sanguinary
amazons
what
they
did
was
perfectly
simple
it
is
possible
even
probable
that
they
were
the
pioneer
pickets
of
our
benighted
land
at
any
rate
bright
and
early
on
the
second
day
of
the
sunlight
bar
the
ladies
of
tinkletown
brought
their
knitting
and
their
sewing
down
to
the
corner
of
main
and
sickle
streets
and
sat
themselves
down
in
front
of
the
shrinking
silver
mine
they
came
with
and
and
and
benches
too
and
instead
of
chanting
a
doleful
lay
they
chattered
in
a
blithe
and
merry
fashion
there
was
no
going
behind
the
fact
however
that
these
smiling
complacent
women
formed

smiling
complacent
women
formed
the
death
watch
that
was
to
witness
the
swift
inevitable
finish
of
the
sunlight
they
came
in
relays
and
they
stayed
until
the
lights
went
out
in
the
desolate
house
of
cheer
the
next
day
they
were
on
hand
again
and
the
next
and
still
the
next
fortunately
for
them
but
most
unluckily
for
the
proprietor
of
the
sunlight
bar
the
month
was
august
they
could
freeze
him
out
but
he
could
freeze
them
out
sheepish
husbands
and
sons
passed
them
by
usually
on
the
opposite
sidewalk
but
not
one
of
them
had
the
hardihood
to
extend
a
helping
hand
to
the
expiring
saloon
at
the
end
of
a
week
the
sunlight
bar
drew
its
last
breath
it
died
of
starvation
the
only
mourner
at
its
bier
was
the
bewildered
who
engaged
a
dray
to
haul
the
remains
to
boggs
city
the
county
seat
and
it
was
he
who
said
as
far
back
as
that
he
was
in
favour
of
taking
the
vote
away
from
the
men
and
giving
it
exclusively
to
the
women
tinkletown
according
to
the
sage
observations
of
uncle
dad
simms
was
rarely
affected
by
the
unsettling
problems
of
the
present
day
this
talk
about
labour
unrest
was
ridiculous
he
said
if
the
remainder
of
the
world
was
anything
like
tinkletown
labour
did
do
much
except
rest
it
was
getting
so
that
if
a
had
very
far
to
walk
to
git
to
his
job
he
had
to
step
along
purty
lively
if
he
wanted
to
arrive
there
in
plenty
of
time
to
eat
his
lunch
and
start
back
home
again
and
as
for
this
here
prohibition
question
he
did
take
any
stock
in
it
at
all
tinkletown
had
got
along
without
liquor
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
and
he
guessed
it
could
get
along
for
another
century
or
two
without
much
trouble
especially
as
it
was
only
ten
miles
to
boggs
city
where
you
could
get
all
you
wanted
to
drink
any
day
in
the
week
besides
he
argued
loudly
and
most
violently
being
so
deaf
that
he
had
to
strain
his
own
throat
in
order
to
hear
himself
there
was
anybody
in
tinkletown
except
alf
reesling
that
ever
wanted
a
drink
and
even
alf
would
take
it
when
you
offered
it
to
him
but
in
spite
of
uncle
dad
sage
conclusions
it
was
this
very
prohibition
question
that
was
disturbing
anderson
crow
he
sauntered
into
the
office
late
one
afternoon
in
may
and
planked
himself
down
in
a
chair
beside
the
editor
desk
there
was
a
troubled
look
in
his
eyes
which
gave
way
to
vexation
after
he
had
made
three
or
four
fruitless
efforts
to
divert
the
writer
attention
from
the
sheet
of
copy
paper
on
which
he
was
scribbling
furiously
how
do
you
spell
beverage
anderson
inquired
squires
abruptly
what
kind
of
beverage
demanded
crow
any
kind
just
so
it
intoxicating
never
mind
i
take
a
chance
and
spell
it
the
easiest
way
that
the
way
the
dictionary
spells
it
so
i
guess
it
all
right
well
sir
what
on
your
mind
besides
your
hat
i
mean
you
look
worried
i
am
worried
have
you
any
idee
as
to
the
size
of
the
apple
crop
in
this
neighbourhood
last
summer
and
fall
harry
not
the
least
well
sir
it
was
the
biggest
we
had
since
the
fall
pickin
what
the
idea
do
you
want
me
to
put
something
in
the
about
bramble
county
bumper
crop
of
pippins
no
i
just
want
to
ask
you
if
there
anything
in
this
new
prohibition
amendment
against
apple
cider
not
that
i
aware
of
well
do
you
know
it
impossible
to
buy
a
good
eatin
or
cookin
apple
in
this
town
today
harry
squires
you
do
say
so
in
spite
of
the
big
crop
last
fall
you
could
buy
all
you
wanted
last
week
by
the
bushel
or
peck
or
barrel
finest
juiciest
apples
you
ever
laid
your
eyes
on
well
i
do
like
apples
anyway
so
it
does
mean
much
in
my
life
anderson
was
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
contemplating
his
foot
with
singular
intentness
was
you
ever
drunk
on
hard
cider
he
inquired
at
last
transferring
his
gaze
to
the
rapidly
moving
hand
that
held
the
pencil
the
reporter
jabbed
a
period
or
full
stop
as
they
call
it
in
a
certain
form
of
literature
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
looked
up
with
sudden
interest
yes
he
said
with
considerable
force
i
never
forget
it
you
can
get
tighter
on
hard
cider
than
anything
else
i
know
of
well
there
you
are
exclaimed
the
marshal
banging
his
gnarled
fist
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
as
far
as
i
make
out
there
ai
no
law
cider
stayin
in
the
barrel
long
enough
to
get
good
and
hard
an
what
more
there
ai
no
law
sellin
cider
hard
or
sweet
is
there
i
get
your
point
anderson
and
i
also
get
your
deductions
concerning
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
all
the
apples
in
tinkletown
apparently
we
are
to
have
a
shortage
of
dried
apples
this
year
with
an
overflow
of
hard
cider
instead
by
george
it
interesting
to
say
the
least
looks
as
though
an
apple
orchard
is
likely
to
prove
more
valuable
than
a
gold
mine
does
it
yes
sir
if
you
got
trees
that
bear
in
the
fall
fall
apples
make
the
best
cider
they
ai
so
mushy
and
as
fer
the
feller
that
owns
a
why
it
he
ought
to
be
as
rich
as
crowsis
i
seem
to
recall
that
you
have
a
on
your
farm
on
mountain
and
a
whacking
good
orchard
too
are
you
thinking
of
resigning
as
marshal
of
tinkletown
what
say
i
see
you
not
went
on
harry
of
course
you
understand
you
very
well
manufacture
hard
cider
and
sell
it
and
still
retain
your
untarnished
reputation
as
a
defender
of
the
law
i
not
figurin
on
makin
hard
cider
said
anderson
with
some
irritation
you
do
hard
cider
harry
it
makes
itself
all
you
do
is
to
rack
the
apple
juice
off
into
a
barrel
or
something
with
a
little
yeast
added
and
then
leave
it
to
do
the
work
it
ferments
then
if
you
want
to
you
rack
it
off
again
an
bottle
it
an
well
gee
whiz
how
tight
you
get
on
it
if
you
ai
got
sense
enough
to
let
it
alone
but
i
ai
thinkin
about
what
i
goin
to
do
i
ai
to
do
anything
but
make
applebutter
out
of
my
orchard
an
maybe
a
little
fer
home
consumption
what
worryin
me
is
what
to
do
about
all
these
other
people
around
here
if
they
all
take
to
makin
cider
this
fall
or
even
sooner
an
if
they
bottle
or
cask
it
proper
we
have
enough
hard
cider
in
this
township
to
give
the
whole
state
of
new
york
the
delirium
trimmins
i
do
see
that
you
can
do
anything
anderson
said
squires
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
puffing
at
his
pipe
you
ca
keep
people
from
making
cider
you
know
and
you
ca
keep
from
drinking
it
besides
who
going
to
take
the
trouble
to
ascertain
whether
it
contains
of
one
percent
alcohol
what
interests
me
more
than
anything
else
is
the
possibility
of
this
township
becoming
in
spite
of
itself
an
to
my
certain
knowledge
it
has
been
up
to
now
the
barrenest
desert
on
god
green
earth
people
are
so
contrary
anderson
complained
for
the
last
fifty
years
the
citizens
of
this
town
and
its
suburbs
have
been
so
dead
set
liquor
that
if
a
man
went
up
to
boggs
city
an
got
a
little
tipsy
he
had
to
run
all
the
way
home
so
he
be
out
of
breath
when
he
got
there
nobody
ever
kept
a
bottle
of
whiskey
in
his
house
nobody
wanted
it
an
it
would
only
be
in
the
way
but
now
look
at
the
minute
the
government
says
they
ca
have
it
they
begin
things
around
in
their
cellars
so
to
make
room
fer
the
barrels
going
to
put
in
an
any
day
you
want
to
drive
out
in
the
country
you
see
farmers
an
hired
men
treatin
the
as
if
they
was
the
tenderest
plants
i
heard
this
mornin
that
henry
wimpelmeyer
is
to
put
in
a
at
his
tanyard
an
old
man
smock
turnin
his
grist
mill
into
an
an
everybody
is
hoardin
apples
harry
it
beats
the
dutch
it
up
to
you
to
frustrate
their
nefarious
schemes
hawkshaw
the
fair
name
of
the
commonwealth
must
be
preserved
i
use
the
word
advisedly
it
sounds
a
great
deal
better
than
now
do
you
want
me
to
begin
a
campaign
in
the
against
the
indiscriminate
and
mendacious
hardening
of
or
am
i
to
leave
the
situation
entirely
in
your
hands
marshal
crow
arose
the
fire
of
determination
was
in
his
ancient
eye
you
leave
it
to
me
said
he
and
strode
majestically
from
the
room
encountering
deacon
rank
in
front
of
the
office
he
chanced
this
somewhat
offensive
remark
say
deacon
what
this
i
hear
about
you
the
deacon
looked
distinctly
uneasy
you
can
always
hear
a
lot
of
things
about
me
that
are
true
he
said
i
ai
so
sure
about
that
said
anderson
eyeing
him
narrowly
hold
on
what
your
hurry
i
i
got
to
step
in
here
and
pay
my
subscription
to
the
said
the
deacon
well
that
something
nobody
believe
when
they
hear
about
it
said
anderson
it
be
mighty
hard
fer
the
proprieter
of
the
to
believe
it
after
all
these
years
times
have
been
so
hard
fer
the
last
couple
of
years
i
really
been
able
to
too
bad
about
you
broke
in
anderson
scornfully
everything
costs
so
much
in
these
days
protested
the
deacon
i
had
a
new
suit
of
clothes
fer
seven
or
eight
years
ca
afford
my
wife
was
sayin
only
last
night
she
needed
a
new
hat
somethin
she
can
wear
all
the
year
round
but
goodness
knows
this
ai
no
time
to
be
thinkin
of
hats
she
she
ai
had
a
new
hat
fer
ten
years
interrupted
anderson
no
wonder
the
pore
woman
ashamed
to
go
to
church
what
that
who
says
she
ashamed
to
go
to
church
anybody
that
says
my
wife
ashamed
to
go
to
church
is
a
is
a
well
he
tells
a
story
that
all
well
why
do
she
go
to
church
because
she
ashamed
of
her
hat
let
me
tell
you
that
anderson
crow
it
a
fine
hat
an
it
just
as
good
as
new
tryin
to
save
it
that
what
she
tryin
to
do
she
knows
it
got
to
last
her
five
or
six
years
more
an
how
in
tarnation
can
she
make
it
last
that
long
if
she
wears
it
all
the
time
use
a
little
common
sense
ca
you
besides
i
thank
you
not
to
stick
your
nose
in
my
family
affairs
any
what
that
you
got
in
your
pocket
demanded
anderson
indicating
the
bulging
sides
of
the
deacon
overcoat
none
of
your
business
now
do
you
get
hot
i
ask
you
again
civil
as
possible
what
you
got
in
your
pocket
i
a
respectable
citizen
of
this
here
town
and
i
wo
put
up
with
any
of
your
cussed
insinuations
snapped
the
deacon
you
act
as
if
i
stole
something
you
i
ai
accusin
you
of
stealin
anything
i
only
accusin
you
of
havin
something
in
your
pocket
no
harm
in
that
is
there
the
deacon
hesitated
for
a
minute
then
he
made
a
determined
effort
to
temporize
and
what
more
he
said
my
wife
hat
comin
back
into
style
before
long
anyhow
it
just
as
i
keep
on
tellin
her
the
styles
kinder
go
in
circles
an
if
she
waits
long
enough
they
get
back
to
the
kind
she
wearin
and
then
she
be
the
first
woman
in
tinkletown
to
have
the
very
style
in
hats
ahead
of
anybody
else
and
it
will
be
as
good
as
new
too
you
bet
after
the
way
been
savin
it
now
i
know
why
you
got
your
pockets
stuffed
full
of
things
eggs
maybe
or
nuts
or
whatever
it
is
you
got
in
it
because
you
tryin
to
save
a
piece
of
wrappin
paper
or
a
bag
or
the
wear
and
tear
on
a
basket
no
wonder
you
got
so
much
money
you
do
know
how
to
spend
it
and
as
for
me
gettin
a
new
suit
of
clothes
pursued
the
deacon
doggedly
if
times
do
get
better
the
chances
are
i
have
to
be
buried
in
the
suit
i
got
on
this
minute
i
never
knowed
times
to
be
so
hard
the
marshal
interrupted
him
you
go
in
an
pay
up
what
you
owe
fer
the
an
i
wait
here
till
you
come
out
deacon
rank
appeared
to
reflect
come
to
think
of
it
i
guess
i
stop
in
on
my
way
back
from
the
post
office
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
he
stopped
short
a
fixed
intent
look
in
his
sharp
little
eyes
his
gaze
was
directed
past
anderson
head
at
some
object
down
the
street
then
quite
abruptly
and
without
even
the
ceremony
of
a
hasty
he
bolted
into
the
office
slamming
the
door
in
the
face
well
i
be
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
astonished
crow
i
never
knowed
him
to
change
his
mind
so
quick
as
that
in
all
my
life
or
so
often
what
the
dickens
indignation
succeeded
wonder
at
this
instant
cutting
off
his
audible
reflections
snapping
his
jaws
together
he
laid
a
resolute
hand
on
the
doorknob
just
as
he
turned
it
and
was
on
the
point
of
stamping
in
after
the
deacon
his
eye
fell
upon
an
approaching
figure
the
figure
of
a
woman
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
hat
she
was
wearing
he
would
have
failed
to
recognize
her
at
once
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
hat
hi
called
out
the
wearer
of
the
too
familiar
object
marshal
crow
let
go
of
the
door
knob
and
stared
at
the
lady
in
sheer
stupefaction
rank
hat
was
perched
rakishly
at
a
perilous
angle
over
one
ear
a
subsequent
shifting
to
an
even
more
precarious
position
over
the
other
ear
as
the
result
of
a
swift
inaccurate
sweep
of
the
lady
hand
created
an
instant
impression
that
it
was
attached
to
her
drab
disordered
hair
by
means
of
a
but
absolutely
dependable
magnet
never
before
had
marshal
crow
seen
that
ancient
hat
so
much
as
the
fraction
of
an
inch
out
of
plumb
with
the
bridge
of
rank
undeviating
nose
she
approached
airily
her
forlorn
little
person
was
erect
even
soldierly
indeed
if
anything
she
was
a
shade
too
erect
at
times
at
such
times
she
appeared
to
be
in
some
danger
of
completely
forgetting
her
equilibrium
she
stepped
high
as
the
saying
is
and
without
her
usual
precision
in
a
word
the
meek
and
retiring
wife
of
deacon
rank
was
hilariously
drunk
pedestrians
far
and
near
stopped
stockstill
in
their
tracks
to
gaze
at
the
jaunty
drudge
storekeepers
peered
and
incredulous
from
windows
and
doors
if
you
suddenly
had
asked
any
one
of
them
when
the
world
was
coming
to
an
end
he
would
have
replied
without
the
slightest
hesitation
she
bore
down
upon
the
petrified
crow
is
zat
you
she
inquired
coming
to
an
uncertain
stop
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
where
oh
where
was
the
subdued
timorous
voice
of
sister
rank
whose
oh
whose
were
the
shrill
and
fearless
tones
that
issued
forth
from
the
lips
of
the
deacon
wife
for
the
lord
sake
lucy
wha
what
ails
you
gasped
the
horrified
marshal
nothing
ails
me
nev
fel
all
my
lipe
life
where
my
hush
hushban
she
brandished
her
right
hand
and
clutched
in
her
fingers
an
implement
that
caused
anderson
eyes
to
almost
start
from

states
where
my
hussam
marshal
crow
looked
hopelessly
at
the
witnesses
who
were
taking
in
the
scene
from
a
respectful
distance
obviously
it
was
his
duty
to
do
something
not
that
he
really
felt
that
the
deacon
head
should
not
be
cut
off
by
his
wife
but
that
it
was
hardly
the
proper
thing
for
her
to
do
it
in
public
virtually
every
man
in
tinkletown
had
declared
at
one
time
or
another
that
rank
ought
to
slit
the
old
skinflint
throat
or
poison
him
or
set
fire
to
him
or
something
of
the
sort
but
even
though
he
agreed
with
them
the
fact
still
remained
that
marshal
crow
considered
it
his
duty
to
protect
the
deacon
in
this
amazing
crisis
gim
me
that
hatchet
lucy

commanded
with
authority

zat
my

before
the
marshal
could
interfere
she
blazed
away
at
one
of
the
windows
in
the
office
there
was
a
crash
of
glass
she
was
now
but
the
startled
guardian
of
the
peace
was
slow
to
realize
it
he
was
still
trying
to
convince
himself
that
it
was
the
gentle
rank
who
stood
before
him
suddenly
to
his
intense
dismay
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
began
to
weep
and
wail
i
i
love
my
hussam

the
door
flew
open
and
harry
squires
strode
forth
what
the
devil
does
this
mean
my
god
rank
wha
what
the
matter
with
her
anderson
the
marshal
gazed
past
him
into
the
office
his
eyes
were
charged
with
apprehension
where
where
the
deacon
head
he
gulped
the
editor
did
not
hear
him
he
had
eyes
and
ears
only
for
the
mumbling
creature
who
dangled
limply
from
the
marshal
neck
her
face
was
hidden
but
her
hat
was
very
much
in
evidence
it
was
bobbing
up
and
down
on
the
back
of
her
head
let
get
her
into
the
office
he
exclaimed
this
is
dreadful
anderson
shocking
a
moment
later
the
door
closed
behind
the
trio
and
a
key
was
turned
in
the
lock
this
was
the
signal
for
a
general
advance
of
all
observers
headed
by
hawkins
the
undertaker
they
swarmed
up
the
steps
and
crowded
about
the
windows
the
thoughtful
squires
however
conducted
rank
to
the
and
the
crowd
was
cheated
bill
smith
the
printer
looked
up
from
his
case
and
pied
half
of
the
leading
editorial
he
proved
to
be
a
printer
of
the
old
school
after
a
soft
envious
whistle
he
remarked
my
god
i
give
a
month
pay
for
one
like
that
and
any
one
who
has
ever
come
in
contact
with
an
printer
will
know
precisely
what
he
meant
oh
my
poor
hussam
murmured
rank
my
poor
hussam
whass
i
have
endured
years
wiz
aller
chrissen
forcitude
of
where
is
my
poor
hussam
she
swept
the
floor
with
a
hazy
uncertain
look
not
observing
anything
that
looked
like
a
head
she
turned
a
bleary
accusing
eye
upon
bill
smith
the
printer
and
there
is
no
telling
what
she
might
have
said
to
him
if
harry
squires
had
not
intervened
sit
down
here
rank
do
your
husband
is
all
right
he
was
here
a
few
minutes
ago
and
which
way
did
he
go
bill
out
said
bill
laconically
jerking
his
head
in
the
direction
of
an
open
window
at
the
rear
didden
didden
i
cuttiz
off
demanded
rank
not
so
you
notice
it
said
bill
well
whose
did
i
nobody
my
dear

said
squires
soothingly
everything

all

on
my
hashet
i
gotter
cuttiz

never
ress
in
my
grave
till
i
cuttiz
off
presently
they
succeeded
in
quieting
her
she
sat
limply
in
an
brought
from
the
front
office
and
stared
pathetically
up
into
the
faces
of
the
three
perspiring
men
can
you
beat
it
spoke
harry
squires
to
the
beaddled
marshal
where
do
you
suppose
she
got
it
muttered
anderson
helplessly
maybe
she
had
a
toothache
or
something
and
took
a
little
brandy
not
a
bit
of
it
said
harry
she
been
hitting
old
man
rank
stock
of
hard
cider
that
what
she
been
doing
impossible
he
our
leadin
he
ai
got
any
hard
cider
he
intoxicatin
liquors
i
heard
him
say
it
a
hundred
times
well
just
ask
was
harry
rejoinder
crow
drew
a
stool
up
beside
the
unfortunate
lady
and
sat
down
what
have
you
been
drinking
lucy
he
asked
gently
patting
her
hand
you
a
liar
said
rank
quite
distinctly
this
was
an
additional
shock
to
anderson
the
amazing
potency
of
strong
drink
was
here
being
exemplified
as
never
before
in
the
history
of
time
a
sober
lucy
rank
would
no
more
have
called
any
one
a
liar
than
she
would
have
cursed
her
maker
such
an
expression
from
the
lips
of
the
meek
and
martyr
was
unbelievable
and
the
way
she
said
it
not
even
pat
murphy
the
driver
with
all
his
years
of
practice
could
have
said
it
with
greater
distinctness
not
even
pat
who
possessed
the
masculine
right
to
amplify
the
behest
with
expletives
not
supposed
to
be
uttered
except
in
the
presence
of
his
own
sex
she
be
swearing
next
said
bill
smith
after
a
short
silence
i
could
stand
he
went
on
taking
his
coat
from
a
peg
in
the
wall
squires
took
the
lady
in
hand
if
you
will
just
be
patient
for
a
little
while
rank
bill
will
go
out
and
find
your
husband
and
bring
him
here
at
once
in
the
meantime
i
will
see
that
your
hatchet
is
sharpened
up
and
put
in
order
for
the
sacrifice
go
on
bill
fetch
the
lady
husband
he
winked
at
the
departing
bill
we
got
to
humour
her
he
said
in
an
aside
to
anderson
these
jags
are
the
worst
in
the
world
the
saying
is
that
a
quart
of
hard
cider
would
start
a
fight
in
heaven
excuse
me
rank
while
i
fix
your
nice
new
hat
for
you
it
is
on
quite
straight
and
it
such
a
pretty
hat
is
it
rank
squinted
at
him
for
a
moment
in
doubtful
surprise
and
then
smiled
my
hussam
tol

said
she
shaking
her
finger
at

not
at

anderson
say

old
goat
he
whispered
the
last
and
the
marshal
responded
nobly
now
while
we
are
waiting
for
rank
perhaps
you
will
tell
us
just
why
you
want
to
cut
his
head
off
today

the
old
villain

up

afraid
to
be
left
alone
with
that
pore
helpless
little
woman
demanded
anderson
i
take
her
hatchet
away
with
me
if
that
what
you
afraid
of
if
you
been
attending
to
your
job
as
a
good
competent
official
of
this
benighted
town
the
poor
helpless
little
woman
would
be
in
the
condition
she
in
now
you
hold
on
there
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
this
shellback
holmes
a
dozen
people
in
this
town
have
been
buying
up
apples
and
grinding
them
and
making
cider
of
them
as
fast
as
they
could
cask
it
ever
since
last
january
making
it
right
under
your
nose
and
this
is
the
first
you
seen
of
it
there
enough
hard
cider
in
tinkletown
at
this
minute
to
pickle
an
army
see
those
bottles
over
there
under
bill
stool
well
old
deacon
rank
left
there
because
he
was
afraid
he
bust
when
he
made
his
exit
through
that
window
he
told
bill
smith
he
could
keep
them
if
he
would
assume
his
indebtedness
to
this
office
two
dollars
and
a
quarter
and
he
also
told
bill
that
he
could
guarantee
that
it
was
good
stuff
we
got
visible
proof
of
it
here
and
we
also
know
how
the
damned
old
rascal
went
about
testing
the
quality
of
his
wares
he
has
tried
it
out
on
the
most
highly
respected
ladies
in
town
that
what
he
done
and
why
because
it
was
the
way
to
do
it
he
did
have
to
waste
more
than
a
quart
on
the
whole
bunch
of
sure
fire
stuff
and
there
are
barrels
of
it
in
this
town
shellback
holmes
waiting
to
be
converted
into
song
now
the
first
thing

stopped
at
the
top
of
the
steps
and
swiftly
ran
his
eye
over
the
excited
throng
he
was
thinking
hard
and
quite
rapidly
for
him
all
the
while
the
crowd
was
shouting
questions
at
him
he
was
deliberately
counting

resolutely

they
advanced
chatting
volubly
and
with
faces
supposed
to
be
wholly
free
from
anxiety
the
merest
glance
however
would
have
penetrated

spotted
i
know
what
become
of
every
derned
apple
that
was
raised
in
this
township
last
year
dead
silence
followed
this
heroic
speech
citizens
looked
at
each
other
and
situate
jones
might
have
been
heard
to
mutter
something
about
an
providence
ed
higgins
lamely
explained
that
he
had
put
up
a
little
for
vinegar
but
anderson
merely
smiled
the
front
door
of
the
house
flew
open
and
several
of
the
first
ladies
of
tinkletown
crowded
into
view
an
invisible
choir
was
singing
the
doxology
hello
boys
called
out
jones
cheerily
come
right
in
zat
nice
old
deacon
been
waiting
for
him
for
nawful
long
time
said
pratt
wait
any
louder
i
mean
longer
you
had
it
right
the
first
time
said
her
husband
just
in
time
for
doxology
called
out
jones
then
we
all
going
down
town
to
hol
late
that
evening
marshal
crow
mounted
the
steps
leading
to
office
and
rang
the
bell
he
rang
it
five
or
six
times
without
getting
any
response
then
he
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
the
doctor
was
out
on
a
table
inside
the
door
lay
the
slate
on
which
people
left
word
for
him
to
come
to
their
houses
as
soon
as
he
returned
the
marshal
put
on
his
glasses
and
took
up
the
pencil
to
write
one
side
of
the
slate
was
already
filled
with
hurried
scribbling
he
squinted
and
with
difficulty
made
out
that
brown
was
wanted
immediately
at
the
homes
of
situate
jones
abbie
nixon
newton
spratt
mort
fryback
professor
rank
rev
maltby
and
joseph
singer
he
sighed
and
shook
his
head
sadly
then
he
moistened
a
finger
and
erased
the
second
name
on
the
list
that
of
abbie
nixon
husbands
first
he
muttered
in
justification
of
his
action
in
substituting
the
following
line
come
at
once
a
crow
marshal
of
tinkletown
compunction
prevailed
however
he
wrote
the
word
over
at
the
bottom
and
turning
the
slate
over
cleared
his
conscience
by
jotting
down
nixon
call
at
the
top
of
the
reverse
side
replacing
it
on
the
table
he
went
away
virtue
was
its
own
reward
in
this
instance
at
least
for
the
worthy
marshal
neglected
to
put
the
slate
down
as
he
had
found
it
nixon
call
alone
was
visible
he
set
out
to
find
harry
squires
that
urbane
gentleman
was
smoking
his
reportorial
in
the
rear
of
lamson
store
except
for
clerk
who
had
seized
the
rare
opportunity
to
delve
uninterruptedly
into
the
mysteries
of
the
latest
nick
carter
the
store
was
empty
the
usual
habitues
were
absent
did
you
get
her
home
inquired
anderson
in
a
low
cautious
tone
i
did
said
harry
see
anything
of
the
deacon
no
but
bill
smith
did
bill
saw
him
down
at
the
crick
an
hour
or
so
ago
knocking
in
the
heads
of
three
or
four
barrels
do
you
know
what
i
been
thinking
anderson
if
somebody
would
only
empty
a
barrel
or
so
of
olive
oil
into
smock
crick
before
morning
we
have
the
foundation
for
the
largest
supply
of
french
dressing
ever
created
in
the
history
of
the
world
crow
looked
scandalized
good
gosh
harry
ai
we
had
enough
scandal
in
this
here
town
today
without
addin
anything
french
to
it
the
only
moral
to
be
attached
to
this
story
lies
in
the
brief
statement
that
crow
indisposition
slight
in
duration
though
it
was
so
occupied
crow
attention
that
by
the
time
he
was
ready
to
begin
his
search
the
second
night
after
the
song
service
there
was
so
much
as
a
pint
of
hard
cider
to
be
found
in
tinkletown
this
condition
was
due
in
a
large
measure
no
doubt
to
the
fact
that
smock
creek
is
an
unusually
swift
little
stream
it
might
even
be
called
turbulent
jake
miller
hangs
himself
have
you
heard
the
latest
news
inquired
newt
spratt
speaking
in
a
hushed
voice
he
addressed
uncle
dad
simms
the
town
oldest
inhabitant
whom
he
met
face
to
face
at
the
corner
of
main
and
sickle
streets
one
fine
morning
in
may
now
any
one
in
tinkletown
would
tell
you
that
it
was
the
sheerest
folly
to
address
uncle
dad
in
a
hushed
voice
spratt
knew
this
as
well
as
he
knew
his
own
name
so
it
should
be
easy
to
understand
that
the
news
was
of
a
somewhat
nature
ordinarily
newt
was
a
jovial
soul
you
could
hear
him
farther
and
usually
longer
than
any
other
male
citizen
in
tinkletown
but
now
he
spoke
in
a
hushed
voice
uncle
dad
put
his
hand
up
to
his
left
ear
and
said
hey
this
seemed
to
bring
spratt
to
his
senses
he
started
violently
stared
hard
for
a
moment
at
the
octogenarian
and
then
strode
off
down
main
street
shaking
his
head
as
much
as
to
say
there
must
be
something
the
matter
with
me
nobody
ever
speaks
to
him
unless
he
to
and
uncle
dad
after
gazing
for
a
long
time
at
the
retreating
figure
resumed
his
shuffling
progress
up
main
street
pleasantly
satisfied
that
newt
had
gone
to
the
trouble
to
tell
him
it
was
a
nice
day
although
it
would
not
have
occurred
to
newt
in
his
dismal
state
of
mind
to
look
upon
the
day
as
a
nice
one
nevertheless
it
was
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
but
without
newt
knowledge
and
the
air
was
soft
and
balmy
and
laden
with
the
perfume
of
spring
birds
were
twittering
in
the
new
green
foliage
of
the
trees
but
newt
heard
them
not
dogs
frisked
in
the
sunshine
wagging
their
tongues
and
tails
but
newt
saw
them
not
hens
cackled
horses
whinnied
children
laughed
and
all
the
world
was
set
to
music
but
newt
was
not
a
happy
man
he
was
not
a
happy
man
for
the
simple
reason
that
everybody
else
in
town
had
heard
the
news
long
before
it
reached
him
for
or
more
he
had
been
putting
that
same
old
question
to
every
one
he
met
indeed
he
even
went
out
of
his
way
five
or
six
blocks
to
ring
the
front
door
bell
at
the
home
of
william
grimes
night
watchman
at
warehouse
rousing
him
from
a
sound
sleep
in
order
to
impart
the
news
to
him
only
to
have
bill
call
him
a
lot
of
hard
names
while
making
it
clear
that
he
had
heard
it
before
going
to
bed
for
the
day
the
more
newt
thought
of
it
the
more
he
realized
that
it
was
his
duty
to
go
back
and
look
up
uncle
dad
simms
even
though
it
meant
yelling
his
head
off
when
he
found
him
it
was
a
moral
certainty
that
the
only
person
in
tinkletown
who
heard
it
was
uncle
dad
and
he
would
take
a
lot
of
telling
the
would
not
be
out
till
the
following
day
for
at
least
twenty
hours
uncle
dad
would
remain
in
the
densest
ignorance
of
the
sensation
that
had
turned
tinkletown
completely
upside
down
somebody
ought
to
tell
him
somebody
ought
to
tell
poor
old
uncle
dad
simms
that
was
all
there
was
about
it
moved
by
a
sharp
thrill
of
benevolence
spratt
retraced
his
steps
an
eager
look
in
his
eyes
he
found
the
old
man
standing
in
the
broad
open
door
of
bill
kepsal
blacksmith
shop
the
blacksmith
assistant
was
banging
away
with
might
and
main
at
his
anvil
and
uncle
dad
wore
a
pleased
satisfied
smile
on
his
thin
old
lips
he
always
said
he
loved
to
stand
there
and
listen
to
the
faint
faraway
music
of
the
hammer
on
the
anvil
so
different
from
the
hammers
and
anvils
they
used
to
have
when
he
was
a
boy
when
they
were
so
blamed
noisy
you
could
hear
yourself
think
newt
took
him
by
the
arm
and
led
him
away
he
was
going
to
tell
him
the
news
but
he
was
going
to
tell
it
to
him
there
the
only
place
to
tell
uncle
dad
anything
was
over
in
the
town
hall
provided
it
was
unoccupied
and
thither
he
conducted
the
expectant
old
man
as
they
mounted
the
steps
leading
to
the
hall
uncle
dad
pleased
expression
developed
into
something
distinctly
audible
something
resembling
a
cackle
of
joy
spratt
favoured
him
with
a
sharp
apprehensive
glance
are
they
goin
to
hold
the
inquest
as
soon
as
all
this
shouted
uncle
dad
putting
his
lips
as
close
as
possible
to
newt
ear
newt
stopped
in
his
tracks
have
heard
it
he
bellowed
what
say
i
say
you
heard
speak
up
speak
up
complained
uncle
dad
you
need
be
afraid
of
hearin
you
newt
he
been
dead
for
six
or
eight
hours
my
god
groaned
newt
for
the
second
time
that
morning
he
left
uncle
dad
high
and
dry
and
started
swiftly
homeward
there
was
the
possible
but
remote
chance
that
his
wife
had
heard
the
news
and
if
she
had
heard
it
she
hear
from
him
he
let
her
know
what
kind
of
a
wife
she
was
never
within
memory
had
he
failed
to
be
the
first
person
in
tinkletown
to
hear
the
news
and
here
he
was
on
this
stupendous
occasion
the
last
of
them
all
and
why
because
he
had
taken
that
one
morning
to
perform
a
peculiarly
arduous
and
intensive
bit
of
hard
work
up
in
the
attic
of
his
wife
house
he
had
chosen
the
attic
because
spratt
rather
vehemently
had
refused
to
let
him
use
the
parlour
or
even
the
kitchen
and
all
the
time
that
he
was
up
in
the
attic
working
his
head
off
trying
to
teach
his
new
fox
terrier
pup
how
to
stand
on
its
hind
legs
and
jump
over
a
broom
stick
this
startling
piece
of
news
was
sweeping
from
one
end
of
tinkletown
to
the
other
never
said
newt
firmly
as
he
hurried
homeward
by
the
back
streets
never
would
he
do
another
day
work
in
his
life
if
this
was
to
be
the
result
of
honest
toil
and
what
more
he
had
even
received
a
single
word
of
praise
from
his
wife
when
he
descended
from
the
attic
and
triumphantly
told
her
what
he
had
accomplished
he
and
the
pup
between
them
after
three
hours
of
solid
painstaking
endeavour
spratt
had
merely
said
if
you
could
learn
that
pup
how
to
split
firewood
or
milk
a
cow
or
repair
the
picket
fence
or
something
like
that
you
might
be
worth
your
salt
newt
spratt
as
it
is
you
ai
as
newt
turned
gloomily
into
the
alley
leading
up
to
his
back
gate
he
espied
the
marshal
of
tinkletown
anderson
crow
leisurely
approaching
from
the
opposite
direction
crow
on
catching
sight
of
newt
hastily
removed
something
from
his
mouth
and
held
it
behind
his
back
perceiving
that
it
was
nobody
but
newt
spratt
he
restored
the
object
to
his
lips
and
began
puffing
away
at
it
but
not
until
he
had
sent
a
furtive
glance
over
his
shoulder
what
you
doin
back
here
inquired
newt
somewhat
offensively
as
the
two
drew
closer
together
lookin
fer
clues
anderson
again
removed
the
pipe
spat
accurately
over
the
hand
with
which
he
shielded
his
straggling
chin
whiskers
and
remarked
do
see
anything
wrong
with
this
here
pipe
newt
he
asked
gazing
rather
pensively
at
the
object
i
do
anything
wrong
with
it
said
newt
still
i
think
you
mighty
sensible
not
to
smoke
it
any
place
except
in
an
alley
why
do
you
get
a
new
one
they
only
cost
ten
cents
if
you
got
a
new
one
once
in
a
while
say
once
a
year
your
wife
would
order
you
out
of
the
house
every
time
you
light
it
she
do
order
me
out
of
the
house
when
i
light
it
retorted
anderson
why
i
never
light
it
till
i
get
two
or
three
blocks
away
from
home
the
subject
apparently
being
exhausted
the
two
lapsed
into
characteristic
silence
spratt
leaned
rather
wearily
against
his
own
back
fence
while
crow
accepted
the
support
of
a
telephone
pole
presently
the
former
started
to
say
something
about
the
weather
but
got
no
farther
than
the
first
two
or
three
words
when
an
astounding
conjecture
caused
him
to
break
off
abruptly
he
glanced
at
the
old
marshal
swallowed
hard
a
couple
of
times
and
then
hopefully
ventured
the
question
anything
new
anderson
the
marshal
responded
with
a
slow
almost
imperceptible
shake
of
the
head
he
was
gazing
reflectively
at
a
couple
of
english
sparrows
perched
on
one
of
the
telephone
wires
some
distance
down
the
line
newt
experienced
a
sudden
overwhelming
joy
caution
however
and
a
certain
fear
that
he
might
be
mistaken
advised
him
to
go
slow
there
remained
the
possibility
that
anderson
might
be
capable
of
simulation
where
the
body
he
inquired
casually
marshal
crow
gaze
deserted
the
sparrows
and
fixed
itself
on
ear
the
what
his
companion
exhaled
a
tremendous
breath
of
satisfaction
life
was
suddenly
worth
living
the
marshal
of
tinkletown
had
not
heard
the
news
the
marshal
well
by
gosh
exclaimed
the
revivified
spratt
where
have
you
been
at
that
my
business
snapped
anderson
all
i
got
to
say
is
that
you
ought
to
be
attendin
to
it
if
it
your
business
said
newt
loftily
you
the
marshal
of
this
here
town
ai
you
and
everybody
in
town
knows
that
jake
miller
is
dead
except
you
you
a
fine
marshal
there
was
withering
scorn
in
newt
voice
he
even
manifested
an
inclination
to
walk
off
and
leave
the
marshal
without
further
enlightenment
anderson
made
a
valiant
effort
to
conceal
his
astonishment
assuming
a
more
or
less
indifferent
air
he
calmly
remarked
i
knowed
jake
was
a
little
under
the
weather
but
i
did
think
it
was
serious
when
did
he
die
he
did
die
said
newt
he
hung
himself
what
that
gasped
anderson
his
jaw
sagging
hung
himself
some
time
last
night
went
on
newt
joyously
from
a
rafter
in
ed
higgins
livery
stable
with
a
clothesline
kicked
a
out
from
under
himself
why
even
uncle
dad
simms
has
heard
about
it
ed
found
him
when
he
went
out
to
wait
a
second
i
your
way
what
the
rush

been
dead
six
or
eight
hours

escape
he
down

your
pipe

it
any
if

my
way

crow
as
he
unlimbered
his
long
legs
and
made
for
the
mouth
of
the
alley
he
was
not
running
but
newt
being
an
undersized
individual
had
no
other
means
of
keeping
up
with
him
unless
he
obeyed
the
sardonic
behest
for
ten
or
fifteen
rods
spratt
jogged
faithfully
at
the
heels
of
the
leader
and
then
suddenly
remembered
that
it
was
a
long
way
to
undertaking
emporium
in
sickle
street
at
least
an
eighth
of
a
mile
as
the
crow
flies
and
as
he
already
had
had
a
hard
day
work
he
slowed
down
to
a
walk
and
then
to
a
standstill
he
concluded
to
wait
till
some
one
came
along
in
a
wagon
or
an
automobile
there
was
any
use
wasting
his
valuable
breath
in
running
much
better
to
save
it
for
future
use
in
the
meantime
by
standing
perfectly
still
he
could
ruminate
to
his
heart
content
marshal
crow
long
strides
soon
carried
him
to
the
corner
of
maple
street
where
he
made
a
sharp
turn
to
the
right
shooting
a
swift
look
over
his
shoulder
as
he
did
so
his
late
companion
was
leaning
against
a
tree
satisfied
that
he
had
completely
thrown
spratt
off
the
trail
anderson
took
a
short
cut
through
justice
of
the
peace
robb
front
and
back
yards
and
eventually
emerged
into
main
street
where
he
slackened
his
pace
to
a
dignified
saunter
he
caught
sight
of
alf
reesling
the
reformed
town
drunkard
holding
conversation
from
the
sidewalk
with
some
one
in
a
second
story
window
of
judy
boarding
house
half
a
block
away
hello
shouted
alf
discovering
the
marshal
here
he
comes
now
where
you
been
all
morning
andy
i
been
huntin
everywhere
for
you
something
horrible
has
happened
i
just
stopped
to
tell
judy
about
it
the
marshal
stopped
and
gazed
upon
alf
with
mild
interest
he
nodded
carelessly
to
in
the
upstairs
window
and
addressed
the
following
significant
remark
to
alf
i
guess
i
got
jake
motive
purty
well
established
alf
you
ask
me
what
i
unearthed
because
i
wo
tell
you
it
a
nice
day
ai
it
judy
before
could
affirm
or
deny
this
polite
bit
of
information
alf
cried
out
you
do
mean
to
say
you
about
it
the
rain
yesterday
and
day
before
has
brought
your
lilacs
out
splendid
judy
said
anderson
ignoring
him
i
was
up
to
your
house
before
eight
and
your
wife
said
gone
out
in
the
country
to
practise
your
new
decoration
day
speech
anderson
how
in
thunder
did
you
find
out
about
jake
marshal
crow
turned
upon
the
speaker
with
some
severity
see
here
alf
are
you
tryin
to
act
like
newt
spratt
that
was
a
deadly
insult
to
alf
what
do
you
mean
he
demanded
hotly
nothin
except
that
newt
had
the
same
kind
of
an
idee
in
his
head
that
you
seem
to
have
got
into
yours
next
time
you
see
newt
you
tell
him
i
been
laughin
myself
almost
sick
over
the
way
i
fooled
him
the
blamed
iggoramus
having
planted
a
seed
that
was
intended
to
bear
the
fruit
of
justification
the
venerable
marshal
decided
that
now
was
the
time
to
prepare
himself
against
anything
further
in
the
shape
of
surprise
so
he
linked
arms
with
alf
and
started
off
down
the
street
now
see
here
alf
he
began
somewhat
sternly
i
wo
stand
for
any
beatin
about
the
bush
from
you
you
got
to
tell
me
the
whole
truth
nothin
but
the
truth
and
if
your
story
hangs
together
and
agrees
with
what
i
already
worked
out
i
see
that
you
get
fair
treatment
and
alf
stopped
short
what
in
sassafras
are
you
talkin
about
what
story
begin
at
the
beginnin
and
tell
me
where
you
was
last
night
and
this
and
where
and
when
you
last
saw
jake
miller
the
marshal
manner
was
decidedly
accusative
although
tempered
by
sadness
something
in
his
voice
betrayed
a
great
and
illy
concealed
regret
that
this
friend
had
got
himself
so
seriously
entangled
in
the
jacob
miller
affair
where
was
i
last
night
and
this
morning
repeated
the
astonished
alf
percisely
said
anderson
tightening
his
grip
on
alf
arm
in
bed
said
alf
succinctly
come
now
warned
the
marshal
none
of
that
i
want
the
truth
out
of
you
when
did
you
last
see
jake
miller
and
what
was
he
doing
i
saw
him
about
half
an
hour
ago
and
he
was
doin
anything
i
mean
before
he
came
to
his
untimely
end
i
do
know
what
you
drivin
at
but
if
it
gives
you
any
satisfaction
i
say
that
the
last
time
i
saw
him
alive
was
yesterday
afternoon
about
four
he
was
unloadin
some
baled
hay
over
at
ed
and
that
all
how
was
he
actin
he
was
actin
like
a
man
unloadin
hay
did
he
appear
to
have
anything
on
his
mind
i
mean
anything
more
than
usual
could
say
did
he
look
pale
or
i
kinder
thought
afterwards
that
he
did
look
a
pale
sort
of
as
if
he
eat
something
that
did
agree
with
him
i
see
well
go
on
go
on
what
tellin
me
where
did
you
next
see
him
oh
there
was
a
lot
of
people
saw
him
after
i
did
why
do
you
ask
them
answer
my
question
i
did
see
him
again
until
about
half
past
seven
this
morning
he
was
hangin
from
a
rafter
in
ed
stable
my
god
it
was
awful
i
know
dream
about
jake
for
the
next
hundred
years
did
he
have
a
rope
around
his
neck
no
he
did
anderson
started
this
was
an
unexpected
reply
well
er
what
he
have
around
his
neck
a
halter
strap
you
you
sure
about
that
positive
i
see
so
far
your
story
jibes
with
the
facts
now
answer
me
this
question
when
and
where
did
you
help
jake
miller
write
that
note
of
farewell
what
gasped
alf
you
heard
me
i
did
help
him
write
any
note
you
did
nobody
helped
him
write
it
how
do
you
know
that
sir
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
jake
left
a
farewell
note
i
not
sayin
whether
he
did
or
not
you
do
mean
to
claim
that
he
did
leave
one
do
you
if
he
did
nobody
that
i
know
of
has
laid
eyes
on
it
anderson
smiled
mysteriously
well
we
drop
that
feature
of
the
case
temporarily
you
was
quite
a
friend
of
jake
miller
was
you
off
and
on
said
alf
same
as
you
was
he
added
quickly
what
reason
did
he
ever
give
you
for
wantin
to
take
his
own
life
think
carefully
now
and
nothing
but
the
truth
mind
you
the
only
thing
i
ever
heard
him
say
that
sounded
suspicious
was
when
he
told
a
crowd
of
us
at
lamson
one
night
that
if
this
here
prohibition
went
into
effect
he
like
to
have
some
one
telegraph
his
sister
in
buffalo
so
she
could
come
on
and
claim
his
remains
but
he
was
a
drinkin
man
alf
and
you
know
it
i
know
but
he
always
said
he
was
lookin
forward
to
the
day
when
he
could
afford
to
get
as
drunk
as
he
sometimes
thought
he
like
to
be
he
was
a
droll
sort
of
a
cuss
jake
was
he
claimed
he
been
savin
up
his
appetite
and
his
money
for
nearly
three
years
so
he
could
see
which
would
last
the
longest
in
a
finish
fight
was
you
present
when
he
was
cut
down
i
was
aha
that
what
i
tryin
to
get
at
who
cut
the
rope
it
was
a
rope
it
was
a
hitchin
strap
an
nobody
cut
it
come
to
think
of
it
it
was
a
perfectly
good
strap
so
two
or
three
of
us
held
jake
body
up
so
ed
higgins
could
untie
it
from
the
rafter
and
then
what
old
man
hawkins
and
doc
brown
said
he
been
dead
five
or
six
hours
i
see
what
did
doc
say
he
died
of
alf
stared
at
him
in
amazement
he
died
of
being
hung
to
a
rafter
marshal
crow
cleared
his
throat
and
was
ominously
silent
for
fifteen
or
twenty
paces
when
he
next
spoke
it
was
with
the
deepest
gravity
there
was
a
dark
significance
in
the
look
he
fixed
upon
alf
is
there
any
proof
that
jake
miller
was
dead
long
before
he
was
strung
up
to
that
rafter
what
that
gasped
alf
once
more
coming
to
a
sudden
stop
it
a
matter
i
ca
discuss
with
anybody
at
present
said
anderson
curtly
have
have
you
deduced
something
important
anderson
implored
alf
eagerly
is
there
evidence
of
foul
play
that
my
business
said
anderson
come
on
do
stand
there
with
your
mouth
open
like
that
he
still
over
at
hawkins
place
is
he
i
been
workin
on
the
quiet
all
by
myself
since
early
this
morning
an
i
do
know
just
what
been
happening
around
here
for
the
last
couple
of
hours
he
was
there
the
last
i
heard
of
him
said
alf
well
you
given
a
purty
good
account
of
yourself
alf
an
unless
something
turns
up
to
change
my
present
opinion
you
are
free
to
come
an
go
as
you
please
see
here
you
blamed
old
hayseed
what
do
you
mean
by
actin
as
if
i
had
anything
to
do
with
jake
mil
you
do
know
what
you
doing
when
you
drunk
alf
reesling
but
i
ai
been
drunk
for
years
you
blamed
old
that
remains
to
be
seen
interrupted
anderson
sternly
now
do
talk
any
more
i
want
to
think
having
obtained
certain
desirable
facts
in
connection
with
the
of
jacob
miller
marshal
crow
ventured
boldly
confidently
into
the
business
section
of
the
town
he
was
now
in
a
position
to
discuss
the
occurrence
with
equanimity
in
fact
with
indifference
moreover
he
could
account
for
his
physical
absence
from
the
centre
of
the
stage
so
to
speak
by
reminding
all
critics
that
he
was
mentally
on
the
job
long
before
ed
higgins
made
the
gruesome
discovery
in
other
words
it
served
his
purpose
to
lie
low
and
observe
from
obscurity
the
progress
of
events
now
tinkletown
had
not
experienced
the
shock
and
thrill
of
suicide
in
a
great
many
years
sundry
citizens
had
met
death
in
an
accidental
way
and
others
had
suddenly
died
of
old
age
but
no
one
had
intentionally
shuffled
off
since
jasper
wiggins
succeeded
in
completing
a
hitherto
unsuccessful
life
by
pulling
the
trigger
of
a
shotgun
with
his
big
toe
back
in
the
fall
of
the
horrendous
act
of
jacob
miller
therefore
created
a
sensation
tinkletown
was
agog
with
excitement
and
awe
everybody
was
talking
about
jake
he
was
by
all
odds
the
most
important
man
in
town
alive
he
had
been
perhaps
the
least
important
he
was
the
sort
of
citizen
you
always
think
of
last
when
trying
to
take
a
mental
census
of
the
people
you
know
by
sight
once
and
only
once
had
jake
seen
his
name
in
the
columns
of
the
and
he
was
so
impressed
that
he
cut
the
article
out
of
the
paper
and
pasted
it
under
the
of
his
best
hat
it
happened
to
be
the
obituary
notice
of
a
farmer
bearing
the
same
name
but
that
made
no
difference
to
jake
he
was
vicariously
honoured
by
having
his
name
in
print
and
in
rather
large
type
at
that
and
now
he
was
to
have
at
least
half
a
page
in
the
with
his
name
in
huge
black
letters
double
column
something
like
this
jake
miller
hangs
himself
column
after
column
of
jake
miller
and
he
not
there
to
rejoice
jake
miller
on
the
front
page
crowding
out
the
news
from
paris
and
washington
displacing
local
society
items
shoving
the
ordinary
obituaries
out
of
their
hallowed
corners
confiscating
space
that
belonged
to
the
lady
maccabees
and
other
lodges
supplanting
thoughtfully
prepared
matter
in
the
editorial
column
why
the
next
issue
of
the
would
be
a
jake
miller
number
from
beginning
to
end
and
jake
not
there
to
enjoy
it
all
jake
had
been
a
more
or
less
stationary
inhabitant
of
tinkletown
for
about
three
years
he
had
taken
up
his
residence
there
without
really
having
had
the
slightest
intention
or
desire
to
do
so
in
fact
he
would
have
been
safely
out
of
the
village
in
another
ten
minutes
if
abbie
nixon
had
missed
the
blackberry
pie
from
the
kitchen
window
sill
where
she
had
set
it
out
to
cool
and
even
then
he
might
have
got
away
if
he
had
had
a
handkerchief
or
something
with
which
to
remove
the
damning
stains
from
his
lips
and
chin
but
in
his
haste
he
used
the
back
of
his
hand
and
well
justice
of
the
peace
robb
sent
him
to
the
calaboose
for
thirty
days
and
that
how
jake
became
a
resident
of
tinkletown
at
the
trial
he
was
so
shamelessly
complimentary
about
nixon
pie
that
the
prosecuting
witness
came
very
near
to
perjuring
herself
in
order
to
show
her
appreciation
the
dignity
of
the
law
was
preserved
only
by
jake
unshaken
resolution
to
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
of
feloniously
eating
one
blackberry
pie
with
relish
nixon
was
so
impressed
by
jake
honesty
that
she
made
a
practice
of
sending
a
pie
to
him
every
during
the
period
of
his
incarceration
but
when
approached
by
two
or
three
citizens
with
the
proposal
that
she
join
with
them
in
providing
the
fellow
with
work
as
a
sort
of
community
she
refused
to
consider
the
matter
at
all
because
most
of
her
silver
had
come
down
from
her
grandmother
and
she
would
part
with
it
for
anything
in
the
world
illustration
the
trial
he
was
shamelessly
complimentary
about
nixon
for
one
who
had
never
laid
eyes
on
the
village
of
tinkletown
up
to
the
day
of
his
arrival
jake
miller
revealed
the
most
astonishing
sense
of
civic
pride
the
first
thing
he
did
after
being
safely
locked
up
was
to
whitewash
the
interior
of
his
residence
the
town
board
furnished
a
rather
thin
mixture
of
slaked
lime
and
water
borrowed
a
whitewash
brush
from
ebenezer
january
and
got
off
with
a
total
cost
of
about
cents
he
also
repaired
several
windows
in
the
calaboose
by
stuffing
newspapers
into
the
broken
panes
remodeled
the
entire
heating
system
with
a
little
stove
polish
put
two
or
three
locks
in
order
and
once
on
finding
that
it
was
possible
to
remove
a
grating
from
one
of
the
windows
crawled
out
of
his
place
of
confinement
and
mowed
the
grass
plot
in
front
of
the
jail
it
was
then
that
the
people
of
tinkletown
began
to
take
notice
of
him
a
few
of
the
more
enterprising
citizens
went
so
far
as
to
consult
justice
robb
about
extending
jake
sentence
indefinitely
claiming
that
it
was
at
all
likely
the
town
would
ever
see
another
prisoner
who
took
as
much
interest
in
keeping
the
jail
in
order
as
he
and
when
he
was
finally
released
he
obtained
a
job
with
ed
higgins
at
a
slight
increase
in
wages
over
what
he
had
been
receiving
while
in
durance
vile
he
was
a
man
with
a
large
adam
apple
and
a
retreating
chin
his
legs
were
so
warped
that
a
good
ten
inches
of
space
separated
the
knees
whence
he
came
and
why
he
was
content
to
abide
in
tinkletown
were
questions
he
always
answered
but
never
in
a
satisfactory
manner
even
the
hardiest
citizens
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
much
use
in
asking
questions
that
jake
could
answer
with
a
slow
and
baffling
wink
he
became
a
fixture
in
tinkletown
doing
odd
jobs
for
nearly
everybody
in
town
and
still
finding
ample
time
to
attend
to
his
duties
at
the
feed
yard
whenever
any
one
had
a
job
to
be
done
that
he
particularly
disliked
doing
himself
he
always
appealed
to
jake
and
jake
did
it
when
not
otherwise
employed
he
slept
in
the
once
inhabited
by
the
prize
stallion
caleb
the
second
now
deceased
and
you
would
have
been
surprised
to
see
what
a
tidy
place
he
made
of
it
by
tacking
up
two
or
three
anatomical
pictures
from
the
and
putting
in
a
folding
bed
or
more
strictly
speaking
a
bed
that
could
be
folded
it
consisted
of
three
discarded
horse
blankets
quite
a
snug
little
you
would
say
and
as
jake
himself
frequently
remarked
a
very
handy
stall
to
have
a
nightmare
in
twice
a
day
regularly
day
in
and
day
out
jake
inquired
at
the
post
office
for
mail
and
invariably
postmaster
lamson
without
looking
replied
nothing

a
singular
thing

the
afternoon
before

hung
himself
he
received
a
letter

rather
fat
one
postmarked

lamson
and
the
loafers
at
the
store
were
still
talking
about
the
extraordinary
event
when
the
former
closed
up
for
the
night
a
little
later
than
usual
and
while
they
were
talking
about
it
jake
was
getting
ready
to
hang
himself
marshal
crow
headed
straight
for
the
office
reesling
trailing
a
few
steps
behind
like
a
dog
at
heel
quite
a
crowd

gathered
in
front
of
hawkins
undertaking
emporium
across
the
street

finishing

long
and
graphic
account
of

suicide

looked
up
as
anderson
sauntered
into
the
back
office

crow

anderson
sat
down
he
pulled
at
his
sparse
chin
whiskers
for
a
moment
or
two
evidently
trying
to
release
something
verbal
failing
in
this
he
sank
back
in
the
chair
and
fixed
squires
with
a
pathetic
look
where

you
been

it
is

while
everybody

was
gazing
at
jake
and
wondering
how
long
he
been
hanging
there
i
with
my
nose
for
news
went
off
in
search
of
that
letter
i
might
have
spared
myself
the
trouble
for
the
last
thing
jake
did
before
ending
his
life
was
to
put
it
in
an
envelope
and
mail
it
to
me
he
also
enclosed
a
short
note
in
which
he
implored
me
to
do
the
right
thing
by
him
and
put
his
name
in
the
biggest
type
we
have
on
hand
that
just
what
i
intend
to
do
now
i
going

going
to
be
allowed
to
tell
about
it

ten
minutes
later
marshal
crow
strode
solemnly
out
of
the
office
and
debouched
upon
the
crowd
in
front
of
hawkins
several
erstwhile
admirers
snickered
he
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
them
instead
he
inquired
in
a
loud
authoritative
voice
if
any
one
had
seen
alf
reesling
i
standin
right
in
front
of
you
said
alf
i
deputize
you

remains
of

to
see
to
it
that
no
one
trespasses
within
fifty
feet
of
it
without
an
order
from
me
or
the
governor
of
new
york
you
will
what
the
devil
are
you
talkin
about
demanded
alf
there
ai
no
remains
around
here
named
camp
the
marshal
smiled
but
there
was
more
pity
than
mirth
in
the
effort
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
do
what
i
deputize
you
to
do
he
said
quietly
is
bill
kepsal
here
present
said
the
blacksmith
with
a
series
of
winks
that
almost
sufficed
to
take
in
the
whole
assemblage
i
deputize
you
william
kepsal
and
he
craned
his
neck
slightly
and
you
newton
spratt
out
there
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
to
act
as
guards
durin
the
night
until
relieved
by
deputy
reesling
at
seven
tomorrow
mornin
you
will
permit
no
one
to
approach
or
remove
the
body
of
moses
briscoe
from
its
present
place
of
confinement
until
further
orders
and
now
feller
citizens
i
must
request

the
crowd

move
an
inch
he
gone
plumb
crazy
said
rush
applegate
to
uncle

simms
and
he
made
such
a
special
effort
that
uncle
dad
heard
him
quite
distinctly
he
always
agreed
uncle
dad
what
he
crazy
about
this
time
come
on
home
anderson
said
alf
reesling
gently
maybe
if
you
took
a
dose
of
lem
me
talk
to
him
interrupted
elmer
pratt
the
photographer
i
had
an
uncle
once
that
in
an
asylum
and
i
used
to
keep
him
quiet
before
he
got
hopeless
by
lettin
on
that
he
really
george
washington
now
look
here
anderson
marshal
crow
held
up
his
hand
there
was
no
sign
of
resentment
in
his
voice
or
manner
as
he
addressed
the
grinning
crowd
i
do
blame
you
for
thinkin
that
man
in
there
is
jake
miller
i
thought
so
myself
until
a
couple
o
days
ago
that
when
i
first
begin
to
suspect
that
he
was
the
very
man
he
now
turns
out
to
be
gentlemen
if
the
individual
that
you
knew
as
jake
miller
had
took
his
own
life
last
night
i
would
have
had
him
behind
the
bars
today
sure
as
all
get
out
he
was
no
more
jake
miller
than
i
am
jake
miller
was
one
of
his
alibis
he
had
you
mean
aliases
interrupted
professor
rank
of
the
high
school
or
nom
de
plumes
added
willie
spence
the
chief
clerk
at
the
grand
view
hotel
one
of
the
most
inveterate
readers
in
town
to
willie
the
name
of
any
author
was
a
nom
de
plume
it
did
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
his
real
name
or
not
he
had
a
lot
of
names
besides
jake
miller
explained
anderson
loftily
and
he
did
have
to
go
to
high
school
to
get
he
added
as
an
afterthought
favouring
professor
rank
with
a
withering
look
now
disperse
all
of
you
go
on
now
willie
disperse
everybody
disperse
except
alf
reesling
you
stay
here
an
keep
watch
till
i
come
back
with
that
he
took
the
easiest
and
most
expeditious
way
of
dispersing
the
crowd
by
walking
briskly
off
in
the
direction
of
main
street
the
crowd
followed
or
more
strictly
speaking
accompanied
him
he
was
the
centre
of
a
drove
of
eager
inquirers
having
successfully
dispersed
the
crowd
in
front
of
hawkins
emporium
he
stopped
in
front
of
the
post
office
and
addressed
it
once
more
all
you
got
to
do
he
announced
taking
a
seat
on
the
porch
is
to
wait
till
the
comes
out
and
then
you
get
all
the
news
i
just
been
in
there
to
tell
harry
squires
about
my
discoveries
and
he
is
workin
his
head
off
now
gettin
it
all
in
shape
for
the
subscribers
to
the
paper
and
that
reminds
me
he
asked
me
to
do
him
a
favour
he
says
there
are
quite
a
number
of
cheap
skates
in
this
town
that
ai
regular
subscribers

the
that
why
ebenezer

says
he
engaged
ebenezer
to
whitewash
the
tomorrow
and
the
barber
shop
be
open
at
all
he
says
it
an
outrage
that
he
stopped
short
to
glare
in
speechless
amazement
at
a
familiar
figure
almost
under
his
nose
i
thought
i
told
you
to
stand
guard
back
there
alf
reesling
he
roared
aw

fifteen
minutes

declared
the
marshal
firmly

there
by
that
time
i
arrest
you
for
contempt
that
suits
me
said
alf
promptly
yes
sir
said
anderson
addressing
the
crowd
i
would
have
nabbed
him
today
if
he
had
gone
an
hung
himself
like
this
he
must
have
got
onto
the
fact
that
i
had
him
dead
to
rights
he
knowed
there
was
any
escape
for
him
no
chance
in
the
world
wait

at
once
and
do
ask
questions
an
say
abner

harry
squires
to

harry
wo
tell
you
a
thing
even
if
your
is
a
regular
subscriber
what
time
is
it
lum
on
being
informed
by
lum
gillespie
that
it
was
later
than
he
thought
marshal
crow
looked
at
his
own
watch
and
arose
in
some
haste
by
ginger
i
got
to
get
busy
i
still
got
to
see
if
i
can
find
that
letter
jake
received
yesterday
afternoon
i
would
be
surprised
if
the
contents
of
that
letter
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
his
hurryin
up
this
hangin
business
like
as
not
it
was
a
warnin
from
some
confederate
of
lettin
him
know
i
was
gettin
purty
hot
on
his
trail
mighty
hard
to
keep
these
things
from
leakin
out
when
you
workin
at
long
range
as
i
been
fer
some
time
my
investigations
have
been
carried
on
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
i
finally
got
narrowed
down
to
a
place
out
west
called
sandusky
ohio
an
i
was
just
on
the
point
of
telegraphin
to
the
police
out
there
that
i
had
their
man
when
this
thing
happens
he
was
assisted
in
his
search
for
the
letter
by
a
volunteer
organization
of
about
one
hundred
men
and
boys
the
search
was
a
most
diligent
one
much
to
the
disgust
of
ed
higgins
the
floor
of
jake
sleeping
apartment
was
yanked
up
by
willing
excited
citizens
the
was
ransacked
from
one
end
to
the
other
the
grain
bins
were
turned
inside
out
and
there
was
some
talk
of
ripping
off
a
section
of
the
roof
at
half
past
twelve
the
marshal
went
home
to
his
midday
meal
leaving
the
work
in
charge
of
lum
gillespie
the
garage
owner
whose
love
for
higgins
was
governed
entirely
by
the
fact
that
the
liveryman
business
interfered
considerably
with
his
own
prosperity
secure
in
the
seclusion
of
his
own
woodshed
marshal
crow
slyly
withdrew
jake
letter
from
an
inside
pocket
and
reread
it
with
great
care
later
on
having
fortified
himself
with
a
substantial
dinner
he
returned
to
the
hunt
advising
the
toilers
that
he
was
going
to
do
a
little
private
searching
based
on
a
deduction
that
had
come
to
him
while
he
was
at
home
he
ambled
off
in
the
direction
of
power
house
gulley
half
an
hour
later
he
reappeared
and
instructed
the
crowd
to
knock
off
work
he
had
found
the
letter
just
where
he
figured
he
would
find
it
i
do
see
why
in
thunder
you
did
figure
it
out
at
breakfast
instead
of
at
dinner
growled
ed
higgins
moodily
surveying
the
wreckage
i
a
notion
to
sue
you
for
damages
look
at
that
look
at
that
never
mind
ed
i
have
lum
an
the
rest
of
put
everything
back
in
order

as
they
found

to

well
from

distance
as

can
close
up
an
you
know
it
all
i
got
to
do
is
to
walk
to
the
corner
there
an
i
see
hawkins
place
as
plain
as
anything
i
could
see
it
from
right
here
if
it
was
fer
lamson
store
an
the
grand
view
hotel
the
marshal
gave
him
a
look
of
bitter
scorn
and
strode
away
the
crowd
straggled
along
behind
anderson
stopped
at
the
office
door
and
exposing
the
dirty
envelope
to
the
eager
gaze
of
the
crowd
advised
every
one
present
to
step
in
and
take
out
a
year
subscription
to
the
paper
then
he
disappeared
the
crowd
surged
forward
filling
the
outer
office
with
something
like
sardine
compactness
the
door
to
squires
private
office
however
closed
sharply
behind
crow
and
for
the
next
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
the
young
lady
bookkeeper
was
busy
taking
subscriptions
from
the
disappointed
throng
she
got
new
subscribers
and
definite
promises
from
a
large
number
of
citizens
who
were
considerably
in
arrears
you
see
it
all
in
your
paper
tomorrow
morning
said
anderson
coming
out
of
the
inner
office
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
consultation
with
the
editor
all
i
can
say
to
you
now
is
that
i
have
captured
one
of
the
most
desperate
criminals
in
the
country
he
has
been
wanted
for
nearly
three
years
for
a
diabolical
crime
it
makes
my
flesh
creep
to
think
of
him
being
loose
among
our
women
an
children
all
this
time
is
there
any
one
here
who
ai
subscribed
to
the
tinkletown
slept
fitfully
that
night
when
it
slept
at
all
the
sole
citizen
enjoying
a
peaceful
night
rest
was
jake
miller
a
singular
circumstance
connected
with
the
broken
rest
of
of
the
people
of
tinkletown
was
the
extraordinary
unanimity
with
which
jake
became
visible
to
them
the
instant
they
did
drop
off
to
sleep
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
the
appeared
with
its
gruesome
story
jake
was
in
very
large
type
but
not
much
larger
after
all
than
marshal
crow
the
whilom
squires
revelling
in
generosity
gave
anderson
all
the
credit
he
held
forth
at
great
length
on
the
achievements
of
the
redoubtable
marshal
winding
up
his
account
with
a
recommendation
that
a
movement
be
inaugurated
at
once
looking
to
the
erection
of
a
memorial
statue
to
the
famous
sleuth
the
concluding
sentence
of
this
bold
panegyric
was
as
follows
do
not
wait
till
he
is
dead
do
it
now
and
appended
in
parentheses
the
statement
that
the
would
head
the
list
of
subscribers
with
a
contribution
of
one
hundred
dollars
in
the
body
of
his
article
squires
printed
in
full
the
contents
of
the
letter
received
by
jacob
miller
on
the
afternoon
before
his
death
the
letter
which
had
been
recovered
after
the
most
diligent
and
acute
search
by
marshal
crow
at
the
bottom
of
an
abandoned
well
in
power
house
gulley
the
letter
which
so
completely
vindicated
the
theories
and
deductions
of
tinkletown
most
celebrated
son
jake
letter
was
from
his
brother
in
sandusky
it
warned
him
that
the
authorities
had
finally
located
him
in
tinkletown
and
that
officers
were
even
then
on
the
way
east
to
pinch
him
they
had
run
him
down
at
last
despite
the
various
aliases
under
which
he
had
sought
to
avoid
apprehension
brotherly
love
impelled
him
to
advise
jake
to
beat
it
as
quick
as
possible
moreover
he
went
on
to
state
that
if
they
got
him
he
swing
as
sure
as
hell
brotherly
interest
no
doubt
was
also
responsible
for
the
frank
admission
that
the
family
had
done
all
it
could
for
him
and
that
if
he
had
had
a
grain
of
sense
or
had
listened
to
his
friends
he
would
have
married
her
in
the
first
place
and
if
he
had
married
her
he
would
have
been
placed
in
a
position
where
he
had
to
beat
her
brains
out
not
that
she
did
deserve
to
have
her
brains
knocked
out
and
all
that
but
you
ca
go
around
doing
that
sort
of
thing
without
getting
into
trouble
about
it
in
short
jake
by
any
other
name
he
was
just
as
guilty
had
slain
his
wife
presumably
in
cold
blood
at
any
rate
squires
sustained
by
the
information
received
from
marshal
crow
who
had
gone
deeply
into
the
case
stated
in
cold
type
that
it
had
been
done
in
cold
blood
apparently
jake
had
decided
that
he
was
tired
of
dodging
the
inevitable
it
was
quite
clear
that
he
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
being
swung
for
his
diabolical
deed
the
account
also
stated
that
marshal
crow
had
at
once
advised
the
western
authorities
by
telegraph
that
he
had
their
man
but
regretted
to
state
the
scoundrel
had
anticipated
arrest
in
the
manner
now
so
well
known
to
the
readers
of
the
long
recognized
as
the
most
enterprising
newspaper
in
that
part
of
the
state
of
new
york
a
day
or
two
later
after
the
inquest
an
officer
arrived
from
sandusky
he
was
a
spectator
at
the
funeral
of
jake
miller
whom
he
readily
identified
as
the
slayer
of
camp
and
was
afterwards
a
most
interested
listener
to
the
recital
given
on
lamson
porch
by
marshal
crow
who
described
with
considerable
zest
and
surprising
fidelity
the
manifold
difficulties
he
had
experienced
in
running
the
criminal
to
earth
one
of
the
most
puzzling
cases
he
had
ever
been
called
upon
to
tackle
the
astonished
officer
walked
over
to
the
grand
view
hotel
with
harry
squires
from
time
to
time
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
in
a
thoroughly
puzzled
manner
i
do
mind
telling
you
squires
he
blurted
out
at
last
that
we
had
the
faintest
idea
that
this
fellow
camp
was
as
desperate
a
character
as
all
this
we
looked
upon
him
as
a
rather
harmless
guy
but
my
god
he
turns
out
to
be
one
of
the
slickest
crooks
in
the
united
states
no
wonder
he
managed
to
give
us
the
slip
all
these
years
it
only
goes
to
show
how
even
the
best
of
us
can
be
fooled
in
a
man
that
right
agreed
harry
it
certainly
does
show
how
you
can
be
fooled
in
a
man
when
i
get
back
home
and
tell
at
headquarters
what
a
slick
duck
he
was
they
throw
a
fit
why
by
gosh
we
all
thought
he
was
a
nut
a
plain
nut
far
be
it
from
me
said
harry
to
speak
ill
of
either
the
living
or
the
dead
it
a
wonder
he
did
up
and
blow
the
head
off
this
old
rube
when
he
found
he
was
about
to
be
cornered
harry
took
that
moment
to
relight
his
pipe
and
then
abruptly
said
good
night
to
the
gentleman
from
sandusky
as
he
rejoined
the
group
in
front
of
lamson
marshal
crow
was
saying
i
mighty
glad
harry
squires
had
sense
enough
not
to
say
in
the
that
as
soon
as
jake
miller
found
out
that
the
jig
was
up
he
took
the
law
in
his
own
hands
and
lynched
himself
the
end
