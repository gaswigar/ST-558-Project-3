his

permission
to
reprint
an
article
which
appeared
in
the
acquisitive
society
i
introductory
it
is
a
commonplace
that
the
characteristic
virtue
of
englishmen
is
their
power
of
sustained
practical
activity
and
their
characteristic
vice
a
reluctance
to
test
the
quality
of
that
activity
by
reference
to
principles
they
are
incurious
as
to
theory
take
fundamentals
for
granted
and
are
more
interested
in
the
state
of
the
roads
than
in
their
place
on
the
map
and
it
might
fairly
be
argued
that
in
ordinary
times
that
combination
of
intellectual
tameness
with
practical
energy
is
sufficiently
serviceable
to
explain
if
not
to
justify
the
equanimity
with
which
its
possessors
bear
the
criticism
of
more
mentally
adventurous
nations
it
is
the
mood
of
those
who
have
made
their
bargain
with
fate
and
are
content
to
take
what
it
offers
without
the
deal
it
leaves
the
mind
free
to
concentrate
undisturbed
upon
profitable
activities
because
it
is
not
distracted
by
a
taste
for
unprofitable
speculations
most
generations
it
might
be
said
walk
in
a
path
which
they
neither
make
nor
discover
but
accept
the
main
thing
is
that
they
should
march
the
blinkers
worn
by
englishmen
enable
them
to
trot
all
the
more
steadily
along
the
beaten
road
without
being
disturbed
by
curiosity
as
to
their
destination
but
if
the
medicine
of
the
constitution
ought
not
to
be
made
its
daily
food
neither
can
its
daily
food
be
made
its
medicine
there
are
times
which
are
not
ordinary
and
in
such
times
it
is
not
enough
to
follow
the
road
it
is
necessary
to
know
where
it
leads
and
if
it
leads
nowhere
to
follow
another
the
search
for
another
involves
reflection
which
is
uncongenial
to
the
bustling
people
who
describe
themselves
as
practical
because
they
take
things
as
they
are
and
leave
them
as
they
are
but
the
practical
thing
for
a
traveler
who
is
uncertain
of
his
path
is
not
to
proceed
with
the
utmost
rapidity
in
the
wrong
direction
it
is
to
consider
how
to
find
the
right
one
and
the
practical
thing
for
a
nation
which
has
stumbled
upon
one
of
the
of
history
is
not
to
behave
as
though
nothing
very
important
were
involved
as
if
it
did
not
matter
whether
it
turned
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
went
up
hill
or
down
dale
provided
that
it
continued
doing
with
a
little
more
energy
what
it
has
done
hitherto
but
to
consider
whether
what
it
has
done
hitherto
is
wise
and
if
it
is
not
wise
to
alter
it
when
the
broken
ends
of
its
industry
its
politics
its
social
organization
have
to
be
pieced
together
after
a
catastrophe
it
must
make
a
decision
for
it
makes
a
decision
even
if
it
refuses
to
decide
if
it
is
to
make
a
decision
which
will
wear
it
must
travel
beyond
the
philosophy
momentarily
in
favor
with
the
proprietors
of
its
newspapers
unless
it
is
to
move
with
the
energetic
futility
of
a
squirrel
in
a
revolving
cage
it
must
have
a
clear
apprehension
both
of
the
deficiency
of
what
is
and
of
the
character
of
what
ought
to
be
and
to
obtain
this
apprehension
it
must
appeal
to
some
standard
more
stable
than
the
momentary
exigencies
of
its
commerce
or
industry
or
social
life
and
judge
them
by
it
it
must
in
short
have
recourse
to
principles
such
considerations
are
perhaps
not
altogether
irrelevant
at
a
time
when
facts
have
forced
upon
englishmen
the
reconsideration
of
their
social
institutions
which
no
appeal
to
theory
could
induce
them
to
undertake
an
appeal
to
principles
is
the
condition
of
any
considerable
reconstruction
of
society
because
social
institutions
are
the
visible
expression
of
the
scale
of
moral
values
which
rules
the
minds
of
individuals
and
it
is
impossible
to
alter
institutions
without
altering
that
moral
valuation
parliament
industrial
organizations
the
whole
complex
machinery
through
which
society
expresses
itself
is
a
mill
which
grinds
only
what
is
put
into
it
and
when
nothing
is
put
into
it
grinds
air
there
are
many
of
course
who
desire
no
alteration
and
who
when
it
is
attempted
will
oppose
it
they
have
found
the
existing
economic
order
profitable
in
the
past
they
desire
only
such
changes
as
will
insure
that
it
is
equally
profitable
in
the
future

they
are
genuinely
unable
to
understand
why
their
countrymen
can
not
bask
happily
by
the
fire
which
warms
themselves
and
ask
like
the
french
when
everything
goes
so
happily
why
trouble
to
change
it
such
persons
are
to
be
pitied
for
they
lack
the
social
quality
which
is
proper
to
man
but
they
do
not
need
argument
for
heaven
has
denied
them
one
of
the
faculties
required
to
apprehend
it
there
are
others
however
who
are
conscious
of
the
desire
for
a
new
social
order
but
who
yet
do
not
grasp
the
implications
of
their
own
desire
men
may
genuinely
sympathize
with
the
demand
for
a
radical
change
they
may
be
conscious
of
social
evils
and
sincerely
anxious
to
remove
them
they
may
set
up
a
new
department
and
appoint
new
officials
and
invent
a
new
name
to
express
their
resolution
to
effect
something
more
drastic
than
reform
and
less
disturbing
than
revolution
but
unless
they
will
take
the
pains
not
only
to
act
but
to
reflect
they
end
by
effecting
nothing
for
they
deliver
themselves
bound
to
those
who
think
they
are
practical
because
they
take
their
philosophy
so
much
for
granted
as
to
be
unconscious
of
its
implications
and
directly
they
try
to
act
that
philosophy
itself
and
serves
as
an
overruling
force
which
presses
their
action
more
deeply
into
the
old
channels
unhappy
man
that
i
am
who
shall
deliver
me
from
the
body
of
this
death
when
they
desire
to
place
their
economic
life
on
a
better
foundation
they
repeat
like
parrots
the
word
productivity
because
that
is
the
word
that
rises
first
in
their
minds
regardless
of
the
fact
that
productivity
is
the
foundation
on
which
it
is
based
already
that
increased
productivity
is
the
one
characteristic
achievement
of
the
age
before
the
war
as
religion
was
of
the
middle
ages
or
art
of
classical
athens
and
that
it
is
precisely
in
the
century
which
has
seen
the
greatest
increase
in
productivity
since
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
that
economic
discontent
has
been
most
acute
when
they
are
touched
by
social
compunction
they
can
think
of
nothing
more
original
than
the
diminution
of
poverty
because
poverty
being
the
opposite
of
the
riches
which
they
value
most
seems
to
them
the
most
terrible
of
human
afflictions
they
do
not
understand
that
poverty
is
a
symptom
and
a
consequence
of
social
disorder
while
the
disorder
itself
is
something
at
once
more
fundamental
and
more
incorrigible
and
that
the
quality
in
their
social
life
which
causes
it
to
demoralize
a
few
by
excessive
riches
is
also
the
quality
which
causes
it
to
demoralize
many
by
excessive
poverty
but
increased
production
is
important
of
course
it
is
that
plenty
is
good
and
scarcity
evil
it
needs
no
ghost
from
the
graves
of
the
past
five
years
to
tell
us
that
but
plenty
depends
upon
effort
and
upon
moral
principles
and
moral
principles
are
what
the
prophets
of
this
dispensation
despise
so
the
world
continues
in
scarcity
because
it
is
too
grasping
and
too
to
seek
that
which
maketh
men
to
be
of
one
mind
in
a
house
the
schemes
for
social
reorganization
put
forward
by
its
commercial
teachers
are
abortive
because
they
endeavor
to
combine
incompatibles
and
if
they
disturb
everything
settle
nothing
they
are
like
a
man
who
when
he
finds
that
his
shoddy
boots
wear
badly
orders
a
pair
two
sizes
larger
instead
of
a
pair
of
good
leather
or
who
makes
up
for
putting
a
bad
sixpence
in
the
plate
on
sunday
by
putting
in
a
bad
shilling
the
next
and
when
their
fit
of
feverish
energy
has
spent
itself
and
there
is
nothing
to
show
for
it
except
disillusionment
they
cry
that
reform
is
impracticable
and
blame
human
nature
when
what
they
ought
to
blame
is
themselves
yet
all
the
time
the
principles
upon
which
industry
should
be
based
are
simple
however
difficult
it
may
be
to
apply
them
and
if
they
are
overlooked
it
is
not
because
they
are
difficult
but
because
they
are
elementary
they
are
simple
because
industry
is
simple
an
industry
when
all
is
said
is
in
its
essence
nothing
more
mysterious
than
a
body
of
men
associated
in
various
degrees
of
competition
and
to
win
their
living
by
providing
the
community
with
some
service
which
it
requires
organize
it
as
you
will
let
it
be
a
group
of
craftsmen
laboring
with
hammer
and
chisel
or
peasants
plowing
their
own
fields
or
armies
of
mechanics
of
a
hundred
different
trades
constructing
ships
which
are
miracles
of
complexity
with
machines
which
are
the
climax
of
centuries
of
invention
its
function
is
service
its
method
is
association
because
its
function
is
service
an
industry
as
a
whole
has
rights
and
duties
towards
the
community
the
abrogation
of
which
involves
privilege
because
its
method
is
association
the
different
parties
within
it
have
rights
and
duties
towards
each
other
and
the
neglect
or
perversion
of
these
involves
oppression
the
conditions
of
a
right
organization
of
industry
are
therefore
permanent
unchanging
and
capable
of
being
apprehended
by
the
most
elementary
intelligence
provided
it
will
read
the
nature
of
its
countrymen
in
the
large
outlines
of
history
not
in
the
bloodless
abstractions
of
experts
the
first
is
that
it
should
be
subordinated
to
the
community
in
such
a
way
as
to
render
the
best
service
technically
possible
that
those
who
render
no
service
should
not
be
paid
at
all
because
it
is
of
the
essence
of
a
function
that
it
should
find
its
meaning
in
the
satisfaction
not
of
itself
but
of
the
end
which
it
serves
the
second
is
that
its
direction
and
government
should
be
in
the
hands
of
persons
who
are
responsible
to
those
who
are
directed
and
governed
because
it
is
the
condition
of
economic
freedom
that
men
should
not
be
ruled
by
an
authority
which
they
can
not
control
the
industrial
problem
in
fact
is
a
problem
of
right
not
merely
of
material
misery
and
because
it
is
a
problem
of
right
it
is
most
acute
among
those
sections
of
the
working
classes
whose
material
misery
is
least
it
is
a
question
first
of
function
and
secondly
of
freedom
ii
rights
and
functions
a
function
may
be
defined
as
an
activity
which
embodies
and
expresses
the
idea
of
social
purpose
the
essence
of
it
is
that
the
agent
does
not
perform
it
merely
for
personal
gain
or
to
gratify
himself
but
recognizes
that
he
is
responsible
for
its
discharge
to
some
higher
authority
the
purpose
of
industry
is
obvious
it
is
to
supply
man
with
things
which
are
necessary
useful
or
beautiful
and
thus
to
bring
life
to
body
or
spirit
in
so
far
as
it
is
governed
by
this
end
it
is
among
the
most
important
of
human
activities
in
so
far
as
it
is
diverted
from
it
it
may
be
harmless
amusing
or
even
exhilarating
to
those
who
carry
it
on
but
it
possesses
no
more
social
significance
than
the
orderly
business
of
ants
and
bees
the
strutting
of
peacocks
or
the
struggles
of
carnivorous
animals
over
carrion
men
have
normally
appreciated
this
fact
however
unwilling
or
unable
they
may
have
been
to
act
upon
it
and
therefore
from
time
to
time
in
so
far
as
they
have
been
able
to
control
the
forces
of
violence
and
greed
they
have
adopted
various
expedients
for
emphasizing
the
social
quality
of
economic
activity
it
is
not
easy
however
to
emphasize
it
effectively
because
to
do
so
requires
a
constant
effort
of
will
against
which
egotistical
instincts
are
in
rebellion
and
because
if
that
will
is
to
prevail
it
must
be
embodied
in
some
social
and
political
organization
which
may
itself
become
so
arbitrary
tyrannical
and
corrupt
as
to
thwart
the
performance
of
function
instead
of
promoting
it
when
this
process
of
degeneration
has
gone
far
as
in
most
european
countries
it
had
by
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
indispensable
thing
is
to
break
the
dead
organization
up
and
to
clear
the
ground
in
the
course
of
doing
so
the
individual
is
emancipated
and
his
rights
are
enlarged
but
the
idea
of
social
purpose
is
discredited
by
the
discredit
justly
attaching
to
the
obsolete
order
in
which
it
is
embodied
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
in
the
new
industrial
societies
which
arose
on
the
ruins
of
the
old
rÃ©gime
the
dominant
note
should
have
been
the
insistence
upon
individual
rights
irrespective
of
any
social
purpose
to
which
their
exercise
contributed
the
economic
expansion
which
concentrated
population
on
the
was
in
essence
an
immense
movement
of
colonization
drifting
from
the
south
and
east
to
the
north
and
west
and
it
was
natural
that
in
those
regions
of
england
as
in
the
american
settlements
the
characteristic
philosophy
should
be
that
of
the
pioneer
and
the
mining
camp
the
change
of
social
quality
was
profound
but
in
england
at
least
it
was
gradual
and
the
industrial
revolution
though
catastrophic
in
its
effects
was
only
the
visible
climax
of
generations
of
subtle
moral
change
the
rise
of
modern
economic
relations
which
may
be
dated
in
england
from
the
latter
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
coincident
with
the
growth
of
a
political
theory
which
replaced
the
conception
of
purpose
by
that
of
mechanism
during
a
great
part
of
history
men
had
found
the
significance
of
their
social
order
in
its
relation
to
the
universal
purposes
of
religion
it
stood
as
one
rung
in
a
ladder
which
stretched
from
hell
to
paradise
and
the
classes
who
composed
it
were
the
hands
the
feet
the
head
of
a
corporate
body
which
was
itself
a
microcosm
imperfectly
reflecting
a
larger
universe
when
the
reformation
made
the
church
a
department
of
the
secular
government
it
undermined
the
already
enfeebled
spiritual
forces
which
had
erected
that
sublime
but
too
much
elaborated
synthesis
but
its
influence
remained
for
nearly
a
century
after
the
roots
which
fed
it
had
been
severed
it
was
the
atmosphere
into
which
men
were
born
and
from
which
however
practical
or
even
machiavellian
they
could
not
easily
disengage
their
spirits
nor
was
it
inconvenient
for
the
new
statecraft
to
see
the
weight
of
a
traditional
religious
sanction
added
to
its
own
concern
in
the
subordination
of
all
classes
and
interests
to
the
common
end
of
which
it
conceived
itself
and
during
the
greater
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
was
commonly
conceived
to
be
the
guardian
the
lines
of
the
social
structure
were
no
longer
supposed
to
reproduce
in
miniature
the
plan
of
a
universal
order
but
common
habits
common
traditions
and
beliefs
common
pressure
from
above
gave
them
a
unity
of
direction
which
restrained
the
forces
of
individual
variation
and
lateral
expansion
and
the
center
towards
which
they
converged
formerly
a
church
possessing
some
of
the
characteristics
of
a
state
was
now
a
state
that
had
clothed
itself
with
many
of
the
attributes
of
a
church
the
difference
between
the
england
of
shakespeare
still
visited
by
the
ghosts
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
england
which
merged
in
from
the
fierce
polemics
of
the
last
two
generations
was
a
difference
of
social
and
political
theory
even
more
than
of
constitutional
and
political
arrangements
not
only
the
facts
but
the
minds
which
appraised
them
were
profoundly
modified
the
essence
of
the
change
was
the
disappearance
of
the
idea
that
social
institutions
and
economic
activities
were
related
to
common
ends
which
gave
them
their
significance
and
which
served
as
their
criterion
in
the
eighteenth
century
both
the
state
and
the
church
had
abdicated
that
part
of
the
sphere
which
had
consisted
in
the
maintenance
of
a
common
body
of
social
ethics
what
was
left
of
it
was
repression
of
a
class
not
the
discipline
of
a
nation
opinion
ceased
to
regard
social
institutions
and
economic
activity
as
amenable
like
personal
conduct
to
moral
criteria
because
it
was
no
longer
influenced
by
the
spectacle
of
institutions
which
arbitrary
capricious
and
often
corrupt
in
their
practical
operation
had
been
the
outward
symbol
and
expression
of
the
subordination
of
life
to
purposes
transcending
private
interests
that
part
of
government
which
had
been
concerned
with
social
administration
if
it
did
not
end
became
at
least
obsolescent
for
such
democracy
as
had
existed
in
the
middle
ages
was
dead
and
the
democracy
of
the
revolution
was
not
yet
born
so
that
government
passed
into
the
lethargic
hand
of
classes
who
wielded
the
power
of
the
state
in
the
interests
of
an
irresponsible
aristocracy
and
the
church
was
even
more
remote
from
the
daily
life
of
mankind
than
the
state
philanthropy
abounded
but
religion
once
the
greatest
social
force
had
become
a
thing
as
private
and
individual
as
the
estate
of
the
squire
or
the
working
clothes
of
the
laborer
there
were
special
dispensations
and
occasional
interventions
like
the
acts
of
a
monarch
who
reprieved
a
criminal
or
signed
an
order
for
his
execution
but
what
was
familiar
and
human
and
lovable
what
was
christian
in
christianity
had
largely
disappeared
god
had
been
thrust
into
the
frigid
altitudes
of
infinite
space
there
was
a
limited
monarchy
in
heaven
as
well
as
upon
earth
providence
was
the
spectator
of
the
curious
machine
which
it
had
constructed
and
set
in
motion
but
the
operation
of
which
it
was
neither
able
nor
willing
to
control
like
the
occasional
intervention
of
the
crown
in
the
proceedings
of
parliament
its
wisdom
was
revealed
in
the
infrequency
of
its
interference
the
natural
consequence
of
the
abdication
of
authorities
which
had
stood
however
imperfectly
for
a
common
purpose
in
social
organization
was
the
gradual
disappearance
from
social
thought
of
the
idea
of
purpose
itself
its
place
in
the
eighteenth
century
was
taken
by
the
idea
of
mechanism
the
conception
of
men
as
united
to
each
other
and
of
all
mankind
as
united
to
god
by
mutual
obligations
arising
from
their
relation
to
a
common
end
which
vaguely
conceived
and
imperfectly
realized
had
been
the
keystone
holding
together
the
social
fabric
ceased
to
be
impressed
upon
men
minds
when
church
and
state
withdrew
from
the
center
of
social
life
to
its
circumference
what
remained
when
the
keystone
of
the
arch
was
removed
was
private
rights
and
private
interests
the
materials
of
a
society
rather
than
a
society
itself
these
rights
and
interests
were
the
natural
order
which
had
been
distorted
by
the
ambitions
of
kings
and
priests
and
which
emerged
when
the
artificial
disappeared
because
they
were
the
creation
not
of
man
but
of
nature
herself
they
had
been
regarded
in
the
past
as
relative
to
some
public
end
whether
religion
or
national
welfare
henceforward
they
were
thought
to
be
absolute
and
indefeasible
and
to
stand
by
their
own
virtue
they
were
the
ultimate
political
and
social
reality
and
since
they
were
the
ultimate
reality
they
were
not
subordinate
to
other
aspects
of
society
but
other
aspects
of
society
were
subordinate
to
them
the
state
could
not
encroach
upon
these
rights
for
the
state
existed
for
their
maintenance
they
determined
the
relation
of
classes
for
the
most
obvious
and
fundamental
of
all
rights
was
property
property
absolute
and
unconditioned
and
those
who
possessed
it
were
regarded
as
the
natural
governors
of
those
who
did
not
society
arose
from
their
exercise
through
the
contracts
of
individual
with
individual
it
fulfilled
its
object
in
so
far
as
by
maintaining
contractual
freedom
it
secured
full
scope
for
their
unfettered
exercise
it
failed
in
so
far
as
like
the
french
monarchy
it
overrode
them
by
the
use
of
an
arbitrary
authority
thus
conceived
society
assumed
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
great
company
in
which
political
power
and
the
receipt
of
dividends
were
justly
assigned
to
those
who
held
the
most
numerous
shares
the
currents
of
social
activity
did
not
converge
upon
common
ends
but
were
dispersed
through
a
multitude
of
channels
created
by
the
private
interests
of
the
individuals
who
composed
society
but
in
their
very
variety
and
spontaneity
in
the
very
absence
of
any
attempt
to
relate
them
to
a
larger
purpose
than
that
of
the
individual
lay
the
best
security
of
its
attainment
there
is
a
mysticism
of
reason
as
well
as
of
emotion
and
the
eighteenth
century
found
in
the
beneficence
of
natural
instincts
a
substitute
for
the
god
whom
it
had
expelled
from
contact
with
society
and
did
not
hesitate
to
identify
them
thus
god
and
nature
planned
the
general
frame
and
bade
and
social
be
the
same
the
result
of
such
ideas
in
the
world
of
practice
was
a
society
which
was
ruled
by
law
not
by
the
caprice
of
governments
but
which
recognized
no
moral
limitation
on
the
pursuit
by
individuals
of
their
economic
in
the
world
of
thought
it
was
a
political
philosophy
which
made
rights
the
foundation
of
the
social
order
and
which
considered
the
discharge
of
obligations
when
it
considered
it
at
all
as
emerging
by
an
inevitable
process
from
their
free
exercise
the
first
famous
exponent
of
this
philosophy
was
locke
in
whom
the
dominant
conception
is
the
indefeasibility
of
private
rights
not
the
harmony
between
private
rights
and
public
welfare
in
the
great
french
writers
who
prepared
the
way
for
the
revolution
while
believing
that
they
were
the
servants
of
an
enlightened
absolutism
there
is
an
almost
equal
emphasis
upon
the
sanctity
of
rights
and
upon
the
infallibility
of
the
alchemy
by
which
the
pursuit
of
private
ends
is
transmuted
into
the
attainment
of
public
good
though
their
writings
reveal
the
influence
of
the
conception
of
society
as
a
mechanism
which
afterwards
became
the
most
characteristic
note
of
the
english
individualism
what
the
french
revolution
burned
into
the
mind
of
europe
was
the
former
not
the
latter
in
england
the
idea
of
right
had
been
negative
and
defensive
a
barrier
to
the
encroachment
of
governments
the
french
leapt
to
the
attack
from
trenches
which
the
english
had
been
content
to
defend
and
in
france
the
idea
became
affirmative
and
militant
not
a
weapon
of
defense
but
a
principle
of
social
organization
the
attempt
to
refound
society
upon
rights
and
rights
springing
not
from
musty
charters
but
from
the
very
nature
of
man
himself
was
at
once
the
triumph
and
the
limitation
of
the
revolution
it
gave
it
the
enthusiasm
and
infectious
power
of
religion
what
happened
in
england
might
seem
at
first
sight
to
have
been
precisely
the
reverse
english
practical
men
whose
thoughts
were
pitched
in
a
lower
key
were
a
little
shocked
by
the
pomp
and
brilliance
of
that
tremendous
creed
they
had
scanty
sympathy
with
the
absolute
affirmations
of
france
what
captured
their
imagination
was
not
the
right
to
liberty
which
made
no
appeal
to
their
commercial
instincts
but
the
expediency
of
liberty
which
did
and
when
the
revolution
had
revealed
the
explosive
power
of
the
idea
of
natural
right
they
sought
some
less
menacing
formula
it
had
been
offered
them
first
by
adam
smith
and
his
precursors
who
showed
how
the
mechanism
of
economic
life
converted
as
with
an
invisible
hand
the
exercise
of
individual
rights
into
the
instrument
of
public
good
bentham
who
despised
metaphysical
subtleties
and
thought
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
as
absurd
as
any
other
dogmatic
religion
completed
the
new
orientation
by
supplying
the
final
criterion
of
political
institutions
in
the
principle
of
utility
henceforward
emphasis
was
transferred
from
the
right
of
the
individual
to
exercise
his
freedom
as
he
pleased
to
the
expediency
of
an
undisturbed
exercise
of
freedom
to
society
the
change
is
significant
it
is
the
difference
between
the
universal
and
equal
citizenship
of
france
with
its
five
million
peasant
proprietors
and
the
organized
inequality
of
england
established
solidly
upon
class
traditions
and
class
institutions
the
descent
from
hope
to
resignation
from
the
fire
and
passion
of
an
age
of
illimitable
vistas
to
the
monotonous
beat
of
the
factory
engine
from
turgot
and
condorcet
to
the
melancholy
mathematical
creed
of
bentham
and
ricardo
and
james
mill
mankind
has
at
least
this
superiority
over
its
philosophers
that
great
movements
spring
from
the
heart
and
embody
a
faith
not
the
nice
adjustments
of
the
hedonistic
calculus
so
in
the
name
of
the
rights
of
property
france
abolished
in
three
years
a
great
mass
of
property
rights
which
under
the
old
rÃ©gime
had
robbed
the
peasant
of
part
of
the
produce
of
his
labor
and
the
social
transformation
survived
a
whole
world
of
political
changes
in
england
the
glad
tidings
of
democracy
were
broken
too
discreetly
to
reach
the
ears
of
the
hind
in
the
furrow
or
the
shepherd
on
the
hill
there
were
political
changes
without
a
social
transformation
the
doctrine
of
utility
though
trenchant
in
the
sphere
of
politics
involved
no
considerable
interference
with
the
fundamentals
of
the
social
fabric
its
exponents
were
principally
concerned
with
the
removal
of
political
abuses
and
legal
anomalies
they
attacked
sinecures
and
pensions
and
the
criminal
code
and
the
procedure
of
the
law
courts
but
they
touched
only
the
surface
of
social
institutions
they
thought
it
a
monstrous
injustice
that
the
citizen
should
pay
of
his
income
in
taxation
to
an
idle
government
but
quite
reasonable
that
he
should
pay
of
it
in
rent
to
an
idle
landlord
the
difference
neverthelesss
was
one
of
emphasis
and
expression
not
of
principle
it
mattered
very
little
in
practice
whether
private
property
and
unfettered
economic
freedom
were
stated
as
in
france
to
be
natural
rights
or
whether
as
in
england
they
were
merely
assumed
once
for
all
to
be
expedient
in
either
case
they
were
taken
for
granted
as
the
fundamentals
upon
which
social
organization
was
to
be
based
and
about
which
no
further
argument
was
admissible
though
bentham
argued
that
rights
were
derived
from
utility
not
from
nature
he
did
not
push
his
analysis
so
far
as
to
argue
that
any
particular
right
was
relative
to
any
particular
function
and
thus
endorsed
indiscriminately
rights
which
were
not
accompanied
by
service
as
well
as
rights
which
were
while
eschewing
in
short
the
phraseology
of
natural
rights
the
english
utilitarians
retained
something
not
unlike
the
substance
of
them
for
they
assumed
that
private
property
in
land
and
the
private
ownership
of
capital
were
natural
institutions
and
gave
them
indeed
a
new
lease
of
life
by
proving
to
their
own
satisfaction
that
social
must
result
from
their
continued
exercise
their
negative
was
as
important
as
their
positive
teaching
it
was
a
conductor
which
diverted
the
lightning
behind
their
political
theory
behind
the
practical
conduct
which
as
always
continues
to
express
theory
long
after
it
has
been
discredited
in
the
world
of
thought
lay
the
acceptance
of
absolute
rights
to
property
and
to
economic
freedom
as
the
unquestioned
center
of
social
organization
the
result
of
that
attitude
was
momentous
the
motive
and
inspiration
of
the
liberal
movement
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
been
the
attack
on
privilege
but
the
creed
which
had
exorcised
the
specter
of
agrarian
feudalism
haunting
village
and
in
france
was
impotent
to
disarm
the
new
ogre
of
industrialism
which
was
stretching
its
limbs
in
the
north
of
england
when
shorn
of
its
splendors
and
illusions
liberalism
triumphed
in
england
in
it
carried
without
criticism
into
the
new
world
of
capitalist
industry
categories
of
private
property
and
freedom
of
contract
which
had
been
forged
in
the
simpler
economic
environment
of
the
era
in
england
these
categories
are
being
bent
and
twisted
till
they
are
no
longer
recognizable
and
will
in
time
be
made
harmless
in
america
where
necessity
compelled
the
crystallization
of
principles
in
a
constitution
they
have
the
rigidity
of
an
iron
jacket
the
magnificent
formulÃ¦
in
which
a
society
of
farmers
and
master
craftsmen
enshrined
its
philosophy
of
freedom
are
in
danger
of
becoming
fetters
used
by
an
business
aristocracy
to
bind
insurgent
movements
on
the
part
of
an
immigrant
and
proletariat
iii
the
acquisitive
society
this
doctrine
has
been
qualified
in
practice
by
particular
limitations
to
avert
particular
evils
and
to
meet
exceptional
emergencies
but
it
is
limited
in
special
cases
precisely
because
its
general
validity
is
regarded
as
beyond
controversy
and
up
to
the
eve
of
the
present
war
it
was
the
working
faith
of
modern
economic
civilization
what
it
implies
is
that
the
foundation
of
society
is
found
not
in
functions
but
in
rights
that
rights
are
not
deducible
from
the
discharge
of
functions
so
that
the
acquisition
of
wealth
and
the
enjoyment
of
property
are
contingent
upon
the
performances
of
services
but
that
the
individual
enters
the
world
equipped
with
rights
to
the
free
disposal
of
his
property
and
the
pursuit
of
his
economic
and
that
these
rights
are
anterior
to
and
independent
of
any
service
which
he
may
render
true
the
service
of
society
will
in
fact
it
is
assumed
result
from
their
exercise
but
it
is
not
the
primary
motive
and
criterion
of
industry
but
a
secondary
consequence
which
emerges
incidentally
through
the
exercise
of
rights
a
consequence
which
is
attained
indeed
in
practice
but
which
is
attained
without
being
sought
it
is
not
the
end
at
which
economic
activity
aims
or
the
standard
by
which
it
is
judged
but
a
as
is
a
of
the
manufacture
of
gas
whether
that
appears
or
not
it
is
not
proposed
that
the
rights
themselves
should
be
abdicated
for
they
are
regarded
not
as
a
conditional
trust
but
as
a
property
which
may
indeed
give
way
to
the
special
exigencies
of
extraordinary
emergencies
but
which
resumes
its
sway
when
the
emergency
is
over
and
in
normal
times
is
above
discussion
that
conception
is
written
large
over
the
history
of
the
nineteenth
century
both
in
england
and
in
america
the
doctrine
which
it
inherited
was
that
property
was
held
by
an
absolute
right
on
an
individual
basis
and
to
this
fundamental
it
added
another
which
can
be
traced
in
principle
far
back
into
history
but
which
grew
to
its
full
stature
only
after
the
rise
of
capitalist
industry
that
societies
act
both
unfairly
and
unwisely
when
they
limit
opportunities
of
economic
enterprise
hence
every
attempt
to
impose
obligations
as
a
condition
of
the
tenure
of
property
or
of
the
exercise
of
economic
activity
has
been
met
by
uncompromising
resistance
the
story
of
the
struggle
between
humanitarian
sentiment
and
the
theory
of
property
transmitted
from
the
eighteenth
century
is
familiar
no
one
has
forgotten
the
opposition
offered
in
the
name
of
the
rights
of
property
to
factory
legislation
to
housing
reform
to
interference
with
the
adulteration
of
goods
even
to
the
compulsory
sanitation
of
private
houses
may
i
not
do
what
i
like
with
my
own
was
the
answer
to
the
proposal
to
require
a
minimum
standard
of
safety
and
sanitation
from
the
owners
of
mills
and
houses
even
to
this
day
while
an
english
urban
landlord
can
cramp
or
distort
the
development
of
a
whole
city
by
withholding
land
except
at
fancy
prices
english
municipalities
are
without
adequate
powers
of
compulsory
purchase
and
must
either
pay
through
the
nose
or
see
thousands
of
their
members
overcrowded
the
whole
body
of
procedure
by
which
they
may
acquire
land
or
indeed
new
powers
of
any
kind
has
been
carefully
designed
by
lawyers
to
protect
owners
of
property
against
the
possibility
that
their
private
rights
may
be
subordinated
to
the
public
interest
because
their
rights
are
thought
to
be
primary
and
absolute
and
public
interests
secondary
and
contingent
no
one
needs
to
be
reminded
again
of
the
influence
of
the
same
doctrine
in
the
sphere
of
taxation
thus
the
income
tax
was
excused
as
a
temporary
measure
because
the
normal
society
was
conceived
to
be
one
in
which
the
individual
spent
his
whole
income
for
himself
and
owed
no
obligations
to
society
on
account
of
it
the
death
duties
were
denounced
as
robbery
because
they
implied
that
the
right
to
benefit
by
inheritance
was
conditional
upon
a
social
sanction
the
budget
of
created
a
storm
not
because
the
taxation
of
land
was
heavy
in
amount
the
were
trifling
but
because
it
was
felt
to
involve
the
doctrine
that
property
is
not
an
absolute
right
but
that
it
may
properly
be
accompanied
by
special
obligations
a
doctrine
which
if
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion
would
destroy
its
sanctity
by
making
ownership
no
longer
absolute
but
conditional
such
an
implication
seems
intolerable
to
an
influential
body
of
public
opinion
because
it
has
been
accustomed
to
regard
the
free
disposal
of
property
and
the
unlimited
exploitation
of
economic
opportunities
as
rights
which
are
absolute
and
unconditioned
on
the
whole
until
recently
this
opinion
had
few
antagonists
who
could
not
be
ignored
as
a
consequence
the
maintenance
of
property
rights
has
not
been
seriously
threatened
even
in
those
cases
in
which
it
is
evident
that
no
service
is
discharged
directly
or
indirectly
by
their
exercise
no
one
supposes
that
the
owner
of
urban
land
performs
owner
any
function
he
has
a
right
of
private
taxation
that
is
all
but
the
private
ownership
of
urban
land
is
as
secure
as
it
was
a
century
ago
and
lord
hugh
cecil
in
his
interesting
little
book
on
conservatism
declares
that
whether
private
property
is
mischievous
or
not
society
can
not
interfere
with
it
because
to
interfere
with
it
is
theft
and
theft
is
wicked
no
one
supposes
that
it
is
for
the
public
good
that
large
areas
of
land
should
be
used
for
parks
and
game
but
our
country
gentlemen
are
still
settled
heavily
upon
their
villages
and
still
slay
their
thousands
no
one
can
argue
that
a
monopolist
is
impelled
by
an
invisible
hand
to
serve
the
public
interest
but
over
a
considerable
field
of
industry
competition
as
the
recent
report
on
trusts
shows
has
been
replaced
by
combination
and
combinations
are
allowed
the
same
unfettered
freedom
as
individuals
in
the
exploitation
of
economic
opportunities
no
one
really
believes
that
the
production
of
coal
depends
upon
the
payment
of
mining
royalties
or
that
ships
will
not
go
to
and
fro
unless
can
earn
fifty
per
cent
upon
their
capital
but
coal
mines
or
rather
the
coal
miner
still
pay
royalties
and
still
make
fortunes
and
are
made
peers
at
the
very
moment
when
everybody
is
talking
about
the
importance
of
increasing
the
output
of
wealth
the
last
question
apparently
which
it
occurs
to
any
statesman
to
ask
is
why
wealth
should
be
squandered
on
futile
activities
and
in
expenditure
which
is
either
disproportionate
to
service
or
made
for
no
service
at
all
so
inveterate
indeed
has
become
the
practice
of
payment
in
virtue
of
property
rights
without
even
the
pretense
of
any
service
being
rendered
that
when
in
a
national
emergency
it
is
proposed
to
extract
oil
from
the
ground
the
government
actually
proposes
that
every
gallon
shall
pay
a
tax
to
landowners
who
never
even
suspected
its
existence
and
the
ingenuous
proprietors
are
full
of
pained
astonishment
at
any
one
questioning
whether
the
nation
is
under
moral
obligation
to
endow
them
further
such
rights
are
strictly
speaking
privileges
for
the
definition
of
a
privilege
is
a
right
to
which
no
corresponding
function
is
attached
the
enjoyment
of
property
and
the
direction
of
industry
are
considered
in
short
to
require
no
social
justification
because
they
are
regarded
as
rights
which
stand
by
their
own
virtue
not
functions
to
be
judged
by
the
success
with
which
they
contribute
to
a
social
purpose
that
doctrine
if
intellectually
discredited
is
still
the
practical
foundation
of
social
organization
how
slowly
it
yields
even
to
the
most
insistent
demonstration
of
its
inadequacy
is
shown
by
the
attitude
which
the
heads
of
the
business
world
have
adopted
to
the
restrictions
imposed
on
economic
activity
during
the
war
the
control
of
railways
mines
and
shipping
the
distribution
of
raw
materials
through
a
public
department
instead
of
through
competing
merchants
the
regulation
of
prices
the
attempts
to
check
profiteering
the
detailed
application
of
these
measures
may
have
been
effective
or
ineffective
wise
or
injudicious
it
is
evident
indeed
that
some
of
them
have
been
foolish
like
the
restriction
of
imports
when
the
world
has
five
years
destruction
to
repair
and
that
others
if
sound
in
conception
have
been
questionable
in
their
execution
if
they
were
attacked
on
the
ground
that
they
obstruct
the
efficient
performance
of
function
if
the
leaders
of
industry
came
forward
and
said
generally
as
some
to
their
honor
have
we
accept
your
policy
but
we
will
improve
its
execution
we
desire
payment
for
service
and
service
only
and
will
help
the
state
to
see
that
it
pays
for
nothing
else
there
might
be
controversy
as
to
the
facts
but
there
could
be
none
as
to
the
principle
in
reality
however
the
gravamen
of
the
charges
brought
against
these
restrictions
appears
generally
to
be
precisely
the
opposite
they
are
denounced
by
most
of
their
critics
not
because
they
limit
the
opportunity
of
service
but
because
they
diminish
the
opportunity
for
gain
not
because
they
prevent
the
trader
enriching
the
community
but
because
they
make
it
more
difficult
for
him
to
enrich
himself
not
in
short
because
they
have
failed
to
convert
economic
activity
into
a
social
function
but
because
they
have
come
too
near
succeeding
if
the
financial
adviser
to
the
coal
controller
may
be
trusted
the
shareholders
in
coal
mines
would
appear
to
have
done
fairly
well
during
the
war
but
the
proposal
to
limit
their
profits
to
per
ton
is
described
by
lord
gainford
as
sheer
robbery
and
confiscation
with
some
honorable
exceptions
what
is
demanded
is
that
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
the
directors
of
industry
should
be
free
to
handle
it
as
an
enterprise
conducted
for
their
own
convenience
or
advancement
instead
of
being
compelled
as
they
have
been
partially
compelled
during
the
war
to
subordinate
it
to
a
social
purpose
for
to
admit
that
the
criterion
of
commerce
and
industry
is
its
success
in
discharging
a
social
purpose
is
at
once
to
turn
property
and
economic
activity
from
rights
which
are
absolute
into
rights
which
are
contingent
and
derivative
because
it
is
to
affirm
that
they
are
relative
to
functions
and
that
they
may
justly
be
revoked
when
the
functions
are
not
performed
it
is
in
short
to
imply
that
property
and
economic
activity
exist
to
promote
the
ends
of
society
whereas
hitherto
society
has
been
regarded
in
the
world
of
business
as
existing
to
promote
them
to
those
who
hold
their
position
not
as
functionaries
but
by
virtue
of
their
success
in
making
industry
contribute
to
their
own
wealth
and
social
influence
such
a
reversal
of
means
and
ends
appears
little
less
than
a
revolution
for
it
means
that
they
must
justify
before
a
social
tribunal
rights
which
they
have
hitherto
taken
for
granted
as
part
of
an
order
which
is
above
criticism
during
the
greater
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
significance
of
the
opposition
between
the
two
principles
of
individual
rights
and
social
functions
was
masked
by
the
doctrine
of
the
inevitable
harmony
between
private
interests
and
public
good
competition
it
was
argued
was
an
effective
substitute
for
honesty
that
subsidiary
doctrine
has
fallen
to
pieces
under
criticism
few
now
would
profess
adherence
to
the
compound
of
economic
optimism
and
moral
bankruptcy
which
led
a
nineteenth
century
economist
to
say
greed
is
held
in
check
by
greed
and
the
desire
for
gain
sets
limits
to
itself
the
disposition
to
regard
individual
rights
as
the
center
and
pivot
of
society
is
still
however
the
most
powerful
element
in
political
thought
and
the
practical
foundation
of
industrial
organization
the
laborious
refutation
of
the
doctrine
that
private
and
public
interests
are
and
that
man
is
god
providence
which
was
the
excuse
of
the
last
century
for
its
worship
of
economic
egotism
has
achieved
in
fact
surprisingly
small
results
economic
egotism
is
still
worshiped
and
it
is
worshiped
because
that
doctrine
was
not
really
the
center
of
the
position
it
was
an
outwork
not
the
citadel
and
now
that
the
outwork
has
been
captured
the
citadel
is
still
to
win
what
gives
its
special
quality
and
character
its
toughness
and
cohesion
to
the
industrial
system
built
up
in
the
last
century
and
a
half
is
not
its
exploded
theory
of
economic
harmonies
it
is
the
doctrine
that
economic
rights
are
anterior
to
and
independent
of
economic
functions
that
they
stand
by
their
own
virtue
and
need
adduce
no
higher
credentials
the
practical
result
of
it
is
that
economic
rights
remain
whether
economic
functions
are
performed
or
not
they
remain
in
a
more
menacing
form
than
in
the
age
of
early
industrialism
for
those
who
control
industry
no
longer
compete
but
combine
and
the
rivalry
between
property
in
capital
and
property
in
land
has
long
since
ended
the
basis
of
the
new
conservatism
appears
to
be
a
determination
so
to
organize
society
both
by
political
and
economic
action
as
to
make
it
secure
against
every
attempt
to
extinguish
payments
which
are
made
not
for
service
but
because
the
owners
possess
a
right
to
extract
income
without
it
hence
the
fusion
of
the
two
traditional
parties
the
proposed
strengthening
of
the
second
chamber
the
return
to
protection
the
swift
conversion
of
rival
industrialists
to
the
advantages
of
monopoly
and
the
attempts
to
buy
off
with
concessions
the
more
influential
section
of
the
working
classes
revolutions
as
a
long
and
bitter
experience
reveals
are
apt
to
take
their
color
from
the
rÃ©gime
which
they
overthrow
is
it
any
wonder
that
the
creed
which
affirms
the
absolute
rights
of
property
should
sometimes
be
met
with
a
of
the
absolute
rights
of
labor
less
indeed
and
inhuman
but
almost
as
dogmatic
almost
as
intolerant
and
thoughtless
as
itself
a
society
which
aimed
at
making
the
acquisition
of
wealth
contingent
upon
the
discharge
of
social
obligations
which
sought
to
proportion
remuneration
to
service
and
denied
it
to
those
by
whom
no
service
was
performed
which
inquired
first
not
what
men
possess
but
what
they
can
make
or
create
or
achieve
might
be
called
a
functional
society
because
in
such
a
society
the
main
subject
of
social
emphasis
would
be
the
performance
of
functions
but
such
a
society
does
not
exist
even
as
a
remote
ideal
in
the
modern
world
though
something
like
it
has
hung
an
unrealized
theory
before
men
minds
in
the
past
modern
societies
aim
at
protecting
economic
rights
while
leaving
economic
functions
except
in
moments
of
abnormal
emergency
to
fulfil
themselves
the
motive
which
gives
color
and
quality
to
their
public
institutions
to
their
policy
and
political
thought
is
not
the
attempt
to
secure
the
fulfilment
of
tasks
undertaken
for
the
public
service
but
to
increase
the
opportunities
open
to
individuals
of
attaining
the
objects
which
they
conceive
to
be
advantageous
to
themselves
if
asked
the
end
or
criterion
of
social
organization
they
would
give
an
answer
reminiscent
of
the
formula
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
but
to
say
that
the
end
of
social
institutions
is
happiness
is
to
say
that
they
have
no
common
end
at
all
for
happiness
is
individual
and
to
make
happiness
the
object
of
society
is
to
resolve
society
itself
into
the
ambitions
of
numberless
individuals
each
directed
towards
the
attainment
of
some
personal
purpose
such
societies
may
be
called
acquisitive
societies
because
their
whole
tendency
and
interest
and
preoccupation
is
to
promote
the
acquisition
of
wealth
the
appeal
of
this
conception
must
be
powerful
for
it
has
laid
the
whole
modern
world
under
its
spell
since
england
first
revealed
the
possibilities
of
industrialism
it
has
gone
from
strength
to
strength
and
as
industrial
civilization
invades
countries
hitherto
remote
from
it
as
russia
and
japan
and
india
and
china
are
drawn
into
its
orbit
each
decade
sees
a
fresh
extension
of
its
influence
the
secret
of
its
triumph
is
obvious
it
is
an
invitation
to
men
to
use
the
powers
with
which
they
have
been
endowed
by
nature
or
society
by
skill
or
energy
or
relentless
egotism
or
mere
good
fortune
without
inquiring
whether
there
is
any
principle
by
which
their
exercise
should
be
limited
it
assumes
the
social
organization
which
determines
the
opportunities
which
different
classes
shall
in
fact
possess
and
concentrates
attention
upon
the
right
of
those
who
possess
or
can
acquire
power
to
make
the
fullest
use
of
it
for
their
own
by
fixing
men
minds
not
upon
the
discharge
of
social
obligations
which
restricts
their
energy
because
it
defines
the
goal
to
which
it
should
be
directed
but
upon
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
pursue
their
own
it
offers
unlimited
scope
for
the
acquisition
of
riches
and
therefore
gives
free
play
to
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
human
instincts
to
the
strong
it
promises
unfettered
freedom
for
the
exercise
of
their
strength
to
the
weak
the
hope
that
they
too
one
day
may
be
strong
before
the
eyes
of
both
it
suspends
a
golden
prize
which
not
all
can
attain
but
for
which
each
may
strive
the
enchanting
vision
of
infinite
expansion
it
assures
men
that
there
are
no
ends
other
than
their
ends
no
law
other
than
their
desires
no
limit
other
than
that
which
they
think
advisable
thus
it
makes
the
individual
the
center
of
his
own
universe
and
dissolves
moral
principles
into
a
choice
of
expediences
and
it
immensely
simplifies
the
problems
of
social
life
in
complex
communities
for
it
relieves
them
of
the
necessity
of
discriminating
between
different
types
of
economic
activity
and
different
sources
of
wealth
between
enterprise
and
avarice
energy
and
unscrupulous
greed
property
which
is
legitimate
and
property
which
is
theft
the
just
enjoyment
of
the
fruits
of
labor
and
the
idle
parasitism
of
birth
or
fortune
because
it
treats
all
economic
activities
as
standing
upon
the
same
level
and
suggests
that
excess
or
defect
waste
or
superfluity
require
no
conscious
effort
of
the
social
will
to
avert
them
but
are
corrected
almost
automatically
by
the
mechanical
play
of
economic
forces
under
the
impulse
of
such
ideas
men
do
not
become
religious
or
wise
or
artistic
for
religion
and
wisdom
and
art
imply
the
acceptance
of
limitations
but
they
become
powerful
and
rich
they
inherit
the
earth
and
change
the
face
of
nature
if
they
do
not
possess
their
own
souls
and
they
have
that
appearance
of
freedom
which
consists
in
the
absence
of
obstacles
between
opportunities
for
and
those
whom
birth
or
wealth
or
talent
or
good
fortune
has
placed
in
a
position
to
seize
them
it
is
not
difficult
either
for
individuals
or
for
societies
to
achieve
their
object
if
that
object
be
sufficiently
limited
and
immediate
and
if
they
are
not
distracted
from
its
pursuit
by
other
considerations
the
temper
which
dedicates
itself
to
the
cultivation
of
opportunities
and
leaves
obligations
to
take
care
of
themselves
is
set
upon
an
object
which
is
at
once
simple
and
practicable
the
eighteenth
century
defined
it
the
twentieth
century
has
very
largely
attained
it
or
if
it
has
not
attained
it
it
has
at
least
grasped
the
possibilities
of
its
attainment
the
national
output
of
wealth
per
head
of
population
is
estimated
to
have
been
approximately
in
unless
mankind
chooses
to
continue
the
sacrifice
of
prosperity
to
the
ambitions
and
terrors
of
nationalism
it
is
possible
that
by
the
year
it
may
be
doubled
iv
the
nemesis
of
industrialism
such
happiness
is
not
remote
from
achievement
in
the
course
of
achieving
it
however
the
world
has
been
confronted
by
a
group
of
unexpected
consequences
which
are
the
cause
of
its
as
the
obstruction
of
economic
opportunity
was
the
cause
of
social
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
these
consequences
are
not
as
is
often
suggested
accidental
but
flow
naturally
from
its
dominant
principle
so
that
there
is
a
sense
in
which
the
cause
of
its
perplexity
is
not
its
failure
but
the
quality
of
its
success
and
its
light
itself
a
kind
of
darkness
the
will
to
economic
power
if
it
is
sufficiently
brings
riches
but
if
it
is
it
destroys
the
moral
restraints
which
ought
to
condition
the
pursuit
of
riches
and
therefore
also
makes
the
pursuit
of
riches
meaningless
for
what
gives
meaning
to
economic
activity
as
to
any
other
activity
is
as
we
have
said
the
purpose
to
which
it
is
directed
but
the
faith
upon
which
our
economic
civilization
reposes
the
faith
that
riches
are
not
a
means
but
an
end
implies
that
all
economic
activity
is
equally
estimable
whether
it
is
subordinated
to
a
social
purpose
or
not
hence
it
divorces
gain
from
service
and
justifies
rewards
for
which
no
function
is
performed
or
which
are
out
of
all
proportion
to
it
wealth
in
modern
societies
is
distributed
according
to
opportunity
and
while
opportunity
depends
partly
upon
talent
and
energy
it
depends
still
more
upon
birth
social
position
access
to
education
and
inherited
wealth
in
a
word
upon
property
for
talent
and
energy
can
create
opportunity
but
property
need
only
wait
for
it
it
is
the
sleeping
partner
who
draws
the
dividends
which
the
firm
produces
the
residuary
legatee
who
always
claims
his
share
in
the
estate
because
rewards
are
divorced
from
services
so
that
what
is
prized
most
is
not
riches
obtained
in
return
for
labor
but
riches
the
economic
origin
of
which
being
regarded
as
sordid
is
concealed
two
results
follow
the
first
is
the
creation
of
a
class
of
pensioners
upon
industry
who
levy
toll
upon
its
product
but
contribute
nothing
to
its
increase
and
who
are
not
merely
tolerated
but
applauded
and
admired
and
protected
with
assiduous
care
as
though
the
secret
of
prosperity
resided
in
them
they
are
admired
because
in
the
absence
of
any
principle
of
discrimination
between
incomes
which
are
payment
for
functions
and
incomes
which
are
not
all
incomes
merely
because
they
represent
wealth
stand
on
the
same
level
of
appreciation
and
are
estimated
solely
by
their
magnitude
so
that
in
all
societies
which
have
accepted
industrialism
there
is
an
upper
layer
which
claims
the
enjoyment
of
social
life
while
it
repudiates
its
responsibilities
the
and
his
ways
how
familiar
they
were
in
england
before
the
war
a
public
school
and
then
club
life
in
oxford
and
cambridge
and
then
another
club
in
town
london
in
june
when
london
is
pleasant
the
moors
in
august
and
pheasants
in
october
cannes
in
december
and
hunting
in
february
and
march
and
a
whole
world
of
rising
bourgeoisie
eager
to
imitate
them
sedulous
to
make
their
expensive
watches
keep
time
with
this
preposterous
calendar
the
second
consequence
is
the
degradation
of
those
who
labor
but
who
do
not
by
their
labor
command
large
rewards
that
is
of
the
great
majority
of
mankind
and
this
degradation
follows
inevitably
from
the
refusal
of
men
to
give
the
purpose
of
industry
the
first
place
in
their
thought
about
it
when
they
do
that
when
their
minds
are
set
upon
the
fact
that
the
meaning
of
industry
is
the
service
of
man
all
who
labor
appear
to
them
honorable
because
all
who
labor
serve
and
the
distinction
which
separates
those
who
serve
from
those
who
merely
spend
is
so
crucial
and
fundamental
as
to
obliterate
all
minor
distinctions
based
on
differences
of
income
but
when
the
criterion
of
function
is
forgotten
the
only
criterion
which
remains
is
that
of
wealth
and
an
acquisitive
society
reverences
the
possession
of
wealth
as
a
functional
society
would
honor
even
in
the
person
of
the
humblest
and
most
laborious
craftsman
the
arts
of
creation
so
wealth
becomes
the
foundation
of
public
esteem
and
the
mass
of
men
who
labor
but
who
do
not
acquire
wealth
are
thought
to
be
vulgar
and
meaningless
and
insignificant
compared
with
the
few
who
acquire
wealth
by
good
fortune
or
by
the
skilful
use
of
economic
opportunities
they
come
to
be
regarded
not
as
the
ends
for
which
alone
it
is
worth
while
to
produce
wealth
at
all
but
as
the
instruments
of
its
acquisition
by
a
world
that
declines
to
be
soiled
by
contact
with
what
is
thought
to
be
the
dull
and
sordid
business
of
labor
they
are
not
happy
for
the
reward
of
all
but
the
very
mean
is
not
merely
money
but
the
esteem
of
their
and
they
know
they
are
not
esteemed
as
soldiers
for
example
are
esteemed
though
it
is
because
they
give
their
lives
to
making
civilization
that
there
is
a
civilization
which
it
is
worth
while
for
soldiers
to
defend
they
are
not
esteemed
because
the
admiration
of
society
is
directed
towards
those
who
get
not
towards
those
who
give
and
though
workmen
give
much
they
get
little
and
the
whom
they
support
are
not
happy
for
in
discarding
the
idea
of
function
which
sets
a
limit
to
the
acquisition
of
riches
they
have
also
discarded
the
principle
which
alone
give
riches
their
meaning
hence
unless
they
can
persuade
themselves
that
to
be
rich
is
in
itself
meritorious
they
may
bask
in
social
admiration
but
they
are
unable
to
esteem
themselves
for
they
have
abolished
the
principle
which
makes
activity
significant
and
therefore
estimable
they
are
indeed
more
truly
pitiable
than
some
of
those
who
envy
them
for
like
the
spirits
in
the
inferno
they
are
punished
by
the
attainment
of
their
desires
a
society
ruled
by
these
notions
is
necessarily
the
victim
of
an
irrational
inequality
to
escape
such
inequality
it
is
necessary
to
recognize
that
there
is
some
principle
which
ought
to
limit
the
gains
of
particular
classes
and
particular
individuals
because
gains
drawn
from
certain
sources
or
exceeding
certain
amounts
are
illegitimate
but
such
a
limitation
implies
a
standard
of
discrimination
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
assumption
that
each
man
has
a
right
to
what
he
can
get
irrespective
of
any
service
rendered
for
it
thus
privilege
which
was
to
have
been
exorcised
by
the
gospel
of
returns
in
a
new
guise
the
creature
no
longer
of
unequal
legal
rights
thwarting
the
natural
exercise
of
equal
powers
of
hand
and
brain
but
of
unequal
powers
springing
from
the
exercise
of
equal
rights
in
a
world
where
property
and
inherited
wealth
and
the
apparatus
of
class
institutions
have
made
opportunities
unequal
inequality
again
leads
to
the
of
production
for
since
the
demand
of
one
income
of
is
as
powerful
a
magnet
as
the
demand
of
incomes
of
it
diverts
energy
from
the
creation
of
wealth
to
the
multiplication
of
luxuries
so
that
for
example
while
of
the
people
of
england
are
overcrowded
a
considerable
part
of
them
are
engaged
not
in
supplying
that
deficiency
but
in
making
rich
hotels
luxurious
yachts
and
motorcars
like
that
used
by
the
secretary
of
state
for
war
with
an
interior
inlaid
with
silver
in
quartered
mahogany
and
upholstered
in
fawn
suede
and
morocco
which
was
recently
bought
by
a
suburban
capitalist
by
way
of
encouraging
useful
industries
and
rebuking
public
extravagance
with
an
example
of
private
economy
for
the
trifling
sum
of
thus
part
of
the
goods
which
are
annually
produced
and
which
are
called
wealth
is
strictly
speaking
waste
because
it
consists
of
articles
which
though
reckoned
as
part
of
the
income
of
the
nation
either
should
not
have
been
produced
until
other
articles
had
already
been
produced
in
sufficient
abundance
or
should
not
have
been
produced
at
all
and
some
part
of
the
population
is
employed
in
making
goods
which
no
man
can
make
with
happiness
or
indeed
without
loss
of
because
he
knows
that
they
had
much
better
not
be
made
and
that
his
life
is
wasted
in
making
them
everybody
recognizes
that
the
army
contractor
who
in
time
of
war
set
several
hundred
navvies
to
dig
an
artificial
lake
in
his
grounds
was
not
adding
to
but
subtracting
from
the
wealth
of
the
nation
but
in
time
of
peace
many
hundred
thousand
workmen
if
they
are
not
digging
ponds
are
doing
work
which
is
equally
foolish
and
wasteful
though
in
peace
as
in
war
there
is
important
work
which
is
waiting
to
be
done
and
which
is
neglected
it
is
neglected
because
while
the
effective
demand
of
the
mass
of
men
is
only
too
small
there
is
a
small
class
which
wears
several
men
clothes
eats
several
men
dinners
occupies
several
families
houses
and
lives
several
men
lives
as
long
as
a
minority
has
so
large
an
income
that
part
of
it
if
spent
at
all
must
be
spent
on
trivialities
so
long
will
part
of
the
human
energy
and
mechanical
equipment
of
the
nation
be
diverted
from
serious
work
which
enriches
it
to
making
trivialities
which
impoverishes
it
since
they
can
only
be
made
at
the
cost
of
not
making
other
things
and
if
the
peers
and
millionaires
who
are
now
preaching
the
duty
of
production
to
miners
and
dock
laborers
desire
that
more
wealth
not
more
waste
should
be
produced
the
simplest
way
in
which
they
can
achieve
their
aim
is
to
transfer
to
the
public
their
whole
incomes
over
say
a
year
in
order
that
it
may
be
spent
in
setting
to
work
not
gardeners
chauffeurs
domestic
servants
and
shopkeepers
in
the
west
end
of
london
but
builders
mechanics
and
teachers
so
to
those
who
clamor
as
many
now
do
produce
produce
one
simple
question
may
be
addressed
produce
what
food
clothing
art
knowledge
by
all
means
but
if
the
nation
is
scantily
furnished
with
these
things
had
it
not
better
stop
producing
a
good
many
others
which
fill
shop
windows
in
regent
street
if
it
desires
to
its
industries
with
machinery
and
its
railways
with
wagons
had
it
not
better
refrain
from
holding
exhibitions
designed
to
encourage
rich
men
to
themselves
with
what
can
be
more
childish
than
to
urge
the
necessity
that
productive
power
should
be
increased
if
part
of
the
productive
power
which
exists
already
is
misapplied
is
not
production
of
futilities
as
important
as
indeed
a
condition
of
production
of
things
of
moment
would
not
spend
less
on
private
luxuries
be
as
wise
a
cry
as
produce
more
yet
this
result
of
inequality
again
is
a
phenomenon
which
can
not
be
prevented
or
checked
or
even
recognized
by
a
society
which
excludes
the
idea
of
purpose
from
its
social
arrangements
and
industrial
activity
for
to
recognize
it
is
to
admit
that
there
is
a
principle
superior
to
the
mechanical
play
of
economic
forces
which
ought
to
determine
the
relative
importance
of
different
occupations
and
thus
to
abandon
the
view
that
all
riches
however
composed
are
an
end
and
that
all
economic
activity
is
equally
justifiable
the
rejection
of
the
idea
of
purpose
involves
another
consequence
which
every
one
laments
but
which
no
one
can
prevent
except
by
abandoning
the
belief
that
the
free
exercise
of
rights
is
the
main
interest
of
society
and
the
discharge
of
obligations
a
secondary
and
incidental
consequence
which
may
be
left
to
take
care
of
itself
it
is
that
social
life
is
turned
into
a
scene
of
fierce
antagonisms
and
that
a
considerable
part
of
industry
is
carried
on
in
the
intervals
of
a
disguised
social
war
the
idea
that
industrial
peace
can
be
secured
merely
by
the
exercise
of
tact
and
forbearance
is
based
on
the
idea
that
there
is
a
fundamental
identity
of
interest
between
the
different
groups
engaged
in
it
which
is
occasionally
interrupted
by
regrettable
misunderstandings
both
the
one
idea
and
the
other
are
an
illusion
the
disputes
which
matter
are
not
caused
by
a
misunderstanding
of
identity
of
interests
but
by
a
better
understanding
of
diversity
of
interests
though
a
formal
declaration
of
war
is
an
episode
the
conditions
which
issue
in
a
declaration
of
war
are
permanent
and
what
makes
them
permanent
is
the
conception
of
industry
which
also
makes
inequality
and
functionless
incomes
permanent
it
is
the
denial
that
industry
has
any
end
or
purpose
other
than
the
satisfaction
of
those
engaged
in
it
that
motive
produces
industrial
warfare
not
as
a
regrettable
incident
but
as
an
inevitable
result
it
produces
industrial
war
because
its
teaching
is
that
each
individual
or
group
has
a
right
to
what
they
can
get
and
denies
that
there
is
any
principle
other
than
the
mechanism
of
the
market
which
determines
what
they
ought
to
get
for
since
the
income
available
for
distribution
is
limited
and
since
therefore
when
certain
limits
have
been
passed
what
one
group
gains
another
group
must
lose
it
is
evident
that
if
the
relative
incomes
of
different
groups
are
not
to
be
determined
by
their
functions
there
is
no
method
other
than
mutual
which
is
left
to
determine
them
indeed
may
cause
them
to
refrain
from
using
their
full
strength
to
enforce
their
claims
and
in
so
far
as
this
happens
peace
is
secured
in
industry
as
men
have
attempted
to
secure
it
in
international
affairs
by
a
balance
of
power
but
the
maintenance
of
such
a
peace
is
contingent
upon
the
estimate
of
the
parties
to
it
that
they
have
more
to
lose
than
to
gain
by
an
overt
struggle
and
is
not
the
result
of
their
acceptance
of
any
standard
of
remuneration
as
an
equitable
settlement
of
their
claims
hence
it
is
precarious
insincere
and
short
it
is
without
finality
because
there
can
be
no
finality
in
the
mere
addition
of
increments
of
income
any
more
than
in
the
gratification
of
any
other
desire
for
material
goods
when
demands
are
conceded
the
old
struggle
recommences
upon
a
new
level
and
will
always
recommence
as
long
as
men
seek
to
end
it
merely
by
increasing
remuneration
not
by
finding
a
principle
upon
which
all
remuneration
whether
large
or
small
should
be
based
such
a
principle
is
offered
by
the
idea
of
function
because
its
application
would
eliminate
the
surpluses
which
are
the
subject
of
contention
and
would
make
it
evident
that
remuneration
is
based
upon
service
not
upon
chance
or
privilege
or
the
power
to
use
opportunities
to
drive
a
hard
bargain
but
the
idea
of
function
is
incompatible
with
the
doctrine
that
every
person
and
organization
have
an
unlimited
right
to
exploit
their
economic
opportunities
as
fully
as
they
please
which
is
the
working
faith
of
modern
industry
and
since
it
is
not
accepted
men
resign
themselves
to
the
settlement
of
the
issue
by
force
or
propose
that
the
state
should
supersede
the
force
of
private
associations
by
the
use
of
its
force
as
though
the
absence
of
a
principle
could
be
compensated
by
a
new
kind
of
machinery
yet
all
the
time
the
true
cause
of
industrial
warfare
is
as
simple
as
the
true
cause
of
international
warfare
it
is
that
if
men
recognize
no
law
superior
to
their
desires
then
they
must
fight
when
their
desires
collide
for
though
groups
or
nations
which
are
at
issue
with
each
other
may
be
willing
to
submit
to
a
principle
which
is
superior
to
them
both
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
submit
to
each
other
hence
the
idea
which
is
popular
with
rich
men
that
industrial
disputes
would
disappear
if
only
the
output
of
wealth
were
doubled
and
every
one
were
twice
as
well
off
not
only
is
refuted
by
all
practical
experience
but
is
in
its
very
nature
founded
upon
an
illusion
for
the
question
is
one
not
of
amounts
but
of
proportions
and
men
will
fight
to
be
paid
a
week
instead
of
as
readily
as
they
will
fight
to
be
paid
instead
of
as
long
as
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
be
paid
instead
of
and
as
long
as
other
men
who
do
not
work
are
paid
anything
at
all
if
miners
demanded
higher
wages
when
every
superfluous
charge
upon
had
been
eliminated
there
would
be
a
principle
with
which
to
meet
their
claim
the
principle
that
one
group
of
workers
ought
not
to
encroach
upon
the
livelihood
of
others
but
as
long
as
mineral
owners
extract
royalties
and
exceptionally
productive
mines
pay
thirty
per
cent
to
absentee
shareholders
there
is
no
valid
answer
to
a
demand
for
higher
wages
for
if
the
community
pays
anything
at
all
to
those
who
do
not
work
it
can
afford
to
pay
more
to
those
who
do
the
naÃ¯ve
complaint
that
workmen
are
never
satisfied
is
therefore
strictly
true
it
is
true
not
only
of
workmen
but
of
all
classes
in
a
society
which
conducts
its
affairs
on
the
principle
that
wealth
instead
of
being
proportioned
to
function
belongs
to
those
who
can
get
it
they
are
never
satisfied
nor
can
they
be
satisfied
for
as
long
as
they
make
that
principle
the
guide
of
their
individual
lives
and
of
their
social
order
nothing
short
of
infinity
could
bring
them
satisfaction
so
here
again
the
prevalent
insistence
upon
rights
and
prevalent
neglect
of
functions
brings
men
into
a
vicious
circle
which
they
can
not
escape
without
escaping
from
the
false
philosophy
which
dominates
them
but
it
does
something
more
it
makes
that
philosophy
itself
seem
plausible
and
exhilarating
and
a
rule
not
only
for
industry
in
which
it
had
its
birth
but
for
politics
and
culture
and
religion
and
the
whole
compass
of
social
life
the
possibility
that
one
aspect
of
human
life
may
be
so
exaggerated
as
to
overshadow
and
in
time
to
atrophy
every
other
has
been
made
familiar
to
englishmen
by
the
example
of
prussian
militarism
militarism
is
the
characteristic
not
of
an
army
but
of
a
society
its
essence
is
not
any
particular
quality
or
scale
of
military
preparation
but
a
state
of
mind
which
in
its
concentration
on
one
particular
element
in
social
life
ends
finally
by
exalting
it
until
it
becomes
the
arbiter
of
all
the
rest
the
purpose
for
which
military
forces
exist
is
forgotten
they
are
thought
to
stand
by
their
own
right
and
to
need
no
justification
instead
of
being
regarded
as
an
instrument
which
is
necessary
in
an
imperfect
world
they
are
elevated
into
an
object
of
superstitious
veneration
as
though
the
world
would
be
a
poor
insipid
place
without
them
so
that
political
institutions
and
social
arrangements
and
intellect
and
morality
and
religion
are
crushed
into
a
mold
made
to
fit
one
activity
which
in
a
sane
society
is
a
subordinate
activity
like
the
police
or
the
maintenance
of
prisons
or
the
cleansing
of
sewers
but
which
in
a
militarist
state
is
a
kind
of
mystical
epitome
of
society
itself
militarism
as
englishmen
see
plainly
enough
is
fetich
worship
it
is
the
prostration
of
men
souls
before
and
the
laceration
of
their
bodies
to
appease
an
idol
what
they
do
not
see
is
that
their
reverence
for
economic
activity
and
industry
and
what
is
called
business
is
also
fetich
worship
and
that
in
their
devotion
to
that
idol
they
torture
themselves
as
needlessly
and
indulge
in
the
same
meaningless
antics
as
the
prussians
did
in
their
worship
of
militarism
for
what
the
military
tradition
and
spirit
have
done
for
prussia
with
the
result
of
creating
militarism
the
commercial
tradition
and
spirit
have
done
for
england
with
the
result
of
creating
industrialism
industrialism
is
no
more
a
necessary
characteristic
of
an
economically
developed
society
than
militarism
is
a
necessary
characteristic
of
a
nation
which
maintains
military
forces
it
is
no
more
the
result
of
applying
science
to
industry
than
militarism
is
the
result
of
the
application
of
science
to
war
and
the
idea
that
it
is
something
inevitable
in
a
community
which
uses
coal
and
iron
and
machinery
so
far
from
being
the
truth
is
itself
a
product
of
the
perversion
of
mind
which
industrialism
produces
men
may
use
what
mechanical
instruments
they
please
and
be
none
the
worse
for
their
use
what
kills
their
souls
is
when
they
allow
their
instruments
to
use
the
essence
of
industrialism
in
short
is
not
any
particular
method
of
industry
but
a
particular
estimate
of
the
importance
of
industry
which
results
in
it
being
thought
the
only
thing
that
is
important
at
all
so
that
it
is
elevated
from
the
subordinate
place
which
it
should
occupy
among
human
interests
and
activities
into
being
the
standard
by
which
all
other
interests
and
activities
are
judged
when
a
cabinet
minister
declares
that
the
greatness
of
this
country
depends
upon
the
volume
of
its
exports
so
that
france
with
exports
comparatively
little
and
elizabethan
england
which
exported
next
to
nothing
are
presumably
to
be
pitied
as
altogether
inferior
civilizations
that
is
industrialism
it
is
the
confusion
of
one
minor
department
of
life
with
the
whole
of
life
when
manufacturers
cry
and
cut
themselves
with
knives
because
it
is
proposed
that
boys
and
girls
of
fourteen
shall
attend
school
for
eight
hours
a
week
and
the
president
of
the
board
of
education
is
so
gravely
impressed
by
their
apprehensions
that
he
at
once
allows
the
hours
to
be
reduced
to
seven
that
is
industrialism
it
is
fetich
worship
when
the
government
obtains
money
for
a
war
which
costs
a
day
by
closing
the
museums
which
cost
a
year
that
is
industrialism
it
is
a
contempt
for
all
interests
which
do
not
contribute
obviously
to
economic
activity
when
the
press
clamors
that
the
one
thing
needed
to
make
this
island
an
arcadia
is
productivity
and
more
productivity
and
yet
more
productivity
that
is
industrialism
it
is
the
confusion
of
means
with
ends
men
will
always
confuse
means
with
ends
if
they
are
without
any
clear
conception
that
it
is
the
ends
not
the
means
which
matter
if
they
allow
their
minds
to
slip
from
the
fact
that
it
is
the
social
purpose
of
industry
which
gives
it
meaning
and
makes
it
worth
while
to
carry
it
on
at
all
and
when
they
do
that
they
will
turn
their
whole
world
upside
down
because
they
do
not
see
the
poles
upon
which
it
ought
to
move
so
when
like
england
they
are
thoroughly
industrialized
they
behave
like
germany
which
was
thoroughly
militarized
they
talk
as
though
man
existed
for
industry
instead
of
industry
existing
for
man
as
the
prussians
talked
of
man
existing
for
war
they
resent
any
activity
which
is
not
colored
by
the
predominant
interest
because
it
seems
a
rival
to
it
so
they
destroy
religion
and
art
and
morality
which
can
not
exist
unless
they
are
disinterested
and
having
destroyed
these
which
are
the
end
for
the
sake
of
industry
which
is
a
means
they
make
their
industry
itself
what
they
make
their
cities
a
desert
of
unnatural
dreariness
which
only
forgetfulness
can
make
endurable
and
which
only
excitement
can
enable
them
to
forget
torn
by
suspicions
and
recriminations
avid
of
power
and
oblivious
of
duties
desiring
peace
but
unable
to
seek
peace
and
ensue
it
because
unwilling
to
surrender
the
creed
which
is
the
cause
of
war
to
what
can
one
compare
such
a
society
but
to
the
international
world
which
also
has
been
called
a
society
and
which
also
is
social
in
nothing
but
name
and
the
comparison
is
more
than
a
play
upon
words
it
is
an
analogy
which
has
its
roots
in
the
facts
of
history
it
is
not
a
chance
that
the
last
two
centuries
which
saw
the
new
growth
of
a
new
system
of
industry
saw
also
the
growth
of
the
system
of
international
politics
which
came
to
a
climax
in
the
period
from
to
both
the
one
and
the
other
are
the
expression
of
the
same
spirit
and
move
in
obedience
to
similar
laws
the
essence
of
the
former
was
the
repudiation
of
any
authority
superior
to
the
individual
reason
it
left
men
free
to
follow
their
own
interests
or
ambitions
or
appetites
untrammeled
by
subordination
to
any
common
center
of
allegiance
the
essence
of
the
latter
was
the
repudiation
of
any
authority
superior
to
the
sovereign
state
which
again
was
conceived
as
a
compact
unit
a
unit
which
would
lose
its
very
essence
if
it
lost
its
independence
of
other
states
just
as
the
one
emancipated
economic
activity
from
a
mesh
of
antiquated
traditions
so
the
other
emancipated
nations
from
arbitrary
subordination
to
alien
races
or
governments
and
turned
them
into
nationalities
with
a
right
to
work
out
their
own
destiny
nationalism
is
in
fact
the
counterpart
among
nations
of
what
individualism
is
within
them
it
has
similar
origins
and
tendencies
similar
triumphs
and
defects
for
nationalism
like
individualism
lays
its
emphasis
on
the
rights
of
separate
units
not
on
their
subordination
to
common
obligations
though
its
units
are
races
or
nations
not
individual
men
like
individualism
it
appeals
to
the
instincts
to
which
it
promises
opportunities
of
unlimited
expansion
like
individualism
it
is
a
force
of
immense
explosive
power
the
just
claims
of
which
must
be
conceded
before
it
is
possible
to
invoke
any
alternative
principle
to
control
its
operations
for
one
can
not
impose
a
supernational
authority
upon
irritated
or
discontented
or
oppressed
nationalities
any
more
than
one
can
subordinate
economic
motives
to
the
control
of
society
until
society
has
recognized
that
there
is
a
sphere
which
they
may
legitimately
occupy
and
like
individualism
if
pushed
to
its
logical
conclusion
it
is
for
as
nationalism
in
its
brilliant
youth
begins
as
a
claim
that
nations
because
they
are
spiritual
beings
shall
determine
themselves
and
passes
too
often
into
a
claim
that
they
shall
dominate
others
so
individualism
begins
by
asserting
the
right
of
men
to
make
of
their
own
lives
what
they
can
and
ends
by
condoning
the
subjection
of
the
majority
of
men
to
the
few
whom
good
fortune
or
special
opportunity
or
privilege
have
enabled
most
successfully
to
use
their
rights
they
rose
together
it
is
probable
that
if
ever
they
decline
they
will
decline
together
for
life
can
not
be
cut
in
compartments
in
the
long
run
the
world
reaps
in
war
what
it
sows
in
peace
and
to
expect
that
international
rivalry
can
be
exorcised
as
long
as
the
industrial
order
within
each
nation
is
such
as
to
give
success
to
those
whose
existence
is
a
struggle
for
is
a
dream
which
has
not
even
the
merit
of
being
beautiful
so
the
perversion
of
nationalism
is
imperialism
as
the
perversion
of
individualism
is
industrialism
and
the
perversion
comes
not
through
any
flaw
or
vice
in
human
nature
but
by
the
force
of
the
idea
because
the
principle
is
defective
and
reveals
its
defects
as
it
reveals
its
power
for
it
asserts
that
the
rights
of
nations
and
individuals
are
absolute
which
is
false
instead
of
asserting
that
they
are
absolute
in
their
own
sphere
but
that
their
sphere
itself
is
contingent
upon
the
part
which
they
play
in
the
community
of
nations
and
individuals
which
is
true
thus
it
constrains
them
to
a
career
of
indefinite
expansion
in
which
they
devour
continents
and
oceans
law
morality
and
religion
and
last
of
all
their
own
souls
in
an
attempt
to
attain
infinity
by
the
addition
to
themselves
of
all
that
is
finite
in
the
meantime
their
rivals
and
their
subjects
and
they
themselves
are
conscious
of
the
danger
of
opposing
forces
and
seek
to
purchase
security
and
to
avoid
a
collision
by
organizing
a
balance
of
power
but
the
balance
whether
in
international
politics
or
in
industry
is
unstable
because
it
reposes
not
on
the
common
recognition
of
a
principle
by
which
the
claims
of
nations
and
individuals
are
limited
but
on
an
attempt
to
find
an
equipoise
which
may
avoid
a
conflict
without
adjuring
the
assertion
of
unlimited
claims
no
such
equipoise
can
be
found
because
in
a
world
where
the
possibilities
of
increasing
military
or
industrial
power
are
illimitable
no
such
equipoise
can
exist
thus
as
long
as
men
move
on
this
plane
there
is
no
solution
they
can
obtain
peace
only
by
surrendering
the
claim
to
the
unfettered
exercise
of
their
rights
which
is
the
cause
of
war
what
we
have
been
witnessing
in
short
during
the
past
five
years
both
in
international
affairs
and
in
industry
is
the
breakdown
of
the
organization
of
society
on
the
basis
of
rights
divorced
from
obligations
sooner
or
later
the
collapse
was
inevitable
because
the
basis
was
too
narrow
for
a
right
is
simply
a
power
which
is
secured
by
legal
sanctions
a
capacity
as
the
lawyers
define
it
residing
in
one
man
of
controlling
with
the
assistance
of
the
state
the
action
of
others
and
a
right
should
not
be
absolute
for
the
same
reason
that
a
power
should
not
be
absolute
no
doubt
it
is
better
that
individuals
should
have
absolute
rights
than
that
the
state
or
the
government
should
have
them
and
it
was
the
reaction
against
the
abuses
of
absolute
power
by
the
state
which
led
in
the
eighteenth
century
to
the
declaration
of
the
absolute
rights
of
individuals
the
most
obvious
defense
against
the
assertion
of
one
extreme
was
the
assertion
of
the
other
because
governments
and
the
relics
of
feudalism
had
encroached
upon
the
property
of
individuals
it
was
affirmed
that
the
right
of
property
was
absolute
because
they
had
strangled
enterprise
it
was
affirmed
that
every
man
had
a
natural
right
to
conduct
his
business
as
he
pleased
but
in
reality
both
the
one
assertion
and
the
other
are
false
and
if
applied
to
practice
must
lead
to
disaster
the
state
has
no
absolute
rights
they
are
limited
by
its
commission
the
individual
has
no
absolute
rights
they
are
relative
to
the
function
which
he
performs
in
the
community
of
which
he
is
a
member
because
unless
they
are
so
limited
the
consequences
must
be
something
in
the
nature
of
private
war
all
rights
in
short
are
conditional
and
derivative
because
all
power
should
be
conditional
and
derivative
they
are
derived
from
the
end
or
purpose
of
the
society
in
which
they
exist
they
are
conditional
on
being
used
to
contribute
to
the
attainment
of
that
end
not
to
thwart
it
and
this
means
in
practice
that
if
society
is
to
be
healthy
men
must
regard
themselves
not
as
the
owners
of
rights
but
as
trustees
for
the
discharge
of
functions
and
the
instruments
of
a
social
purpose
v
property
and
creative
work
the
application
of
the
principle
that
society
should
be
organized
upon
the
basis
of
functions
is
not
recondite
but
simple
and
direct
it
offers
in
the
first
place
a
standard
for
discriminating
between
those
types
of
private
property
which
are
legitimate
and
those
which
are
not
during
the
last
century
and
a
half
political
thought
has
oscillated
between
two
conceptions
of
property
both
of
which
in
their
different
ways
are
extravagant
on
the
one
hand
the
practical
foundation
of
social
organization
has
been
the
doctrine
that
the
particular
forms
of
private
property
which
exist
at
any
moment
are
a
thing
sacred
and
inviolable
that
anything
may
properly
become
the
object
of
property
rights
and
that
when
it
does
the
title
to
it
is
absolute
and
unconditioned
the
modern
industrial
system
took
shape
in
an
age
when
this
theory
of
property
was
triumphant
the
american
constitution
and
the
french
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
both
treated
property
as
one
of
the
fundamental
rights
which
governments
exist
to
protect
the
english
revolution
of
undogmatic
and
reticent
though
it
was
had
in
effect
done
the
same
the
great
individualists
from
locke
to
turgot
adam
smith
and
bentham
all
repeated
in
different
language
a
similar
conception
though
what
gave
the
revolution
its
diabolical
character
in
the
eyes
of
the
english
upper
classes
was
its
treatment
of
property
the
dogma
of
the
sanctity
of
private
property
was
maintained
as
tenaciously
by
french
jacobins
as
by
english
tories
and
the
theory
that
property
is
an
absolute
which
is
held
by
many
modern
conservatives
is
identical
if
only
they
knew
it
with
that
not
only
of
the
men
of
but
of
the
convention
itself
on
the
other
hand
the
attack
has
been
almost
as
undiscriminating
as
the
defense
private
property
has
been
the
central
position
against
which
the
social
movement
of
the
last
hundred
years
has
directed
its
forces
the
criticism
of
it
has
ranged
from
an
imaginative
communism
in
the
most
elementary
and
personal
of
necessaries
to
prosaic
and
partially
realized
proposals
to
transfer
certain
kinds
of
property
from
private
to
public
ownership
or
to
limit
their
exploitation
by
restrictions
imposed
by
the
state
but
however
varying
in
emphasis
and
in
method
the
general
note
of
what
may
conveniently
be
called
the
socialist
criticism
of
property
is
what
the
word
socialism
itself
implies
its
essence
is
the
statement
that
the
economic
evils
of
society
are
primarily
due
to
the
unregulated
operation
under
modern
conditions
of
industrial
organization
of
the
institution
of
private
property
the
divergence
of
opinion
is
natural
since
in
most
discussions
of
property
the
opposing
theorists
have
usually
been
discussing
different
things
property
is
the
most
ambiguous
of
categories
it
covers
a
multitude
of
rights
which
have
nothing
in
common
except
that
they
are
exercised
by
persons

enforced
by
the
state
apart
from
these
formal
characteristics
they
vary
indefinitely
in
economic
character
in
social
effect
and
in
moral
justification
they
may
be
conditional
like
the
grant
of
patent
rights
or
absolute
like
the
ownership
of
ground
rents
terminable
like
copyright
or
permanent
like
a
freehold
as
comprehensive
as
sovereignty
or
as
restricted
as
an
easement
as
intimate
and
personal
as
the
ownership
of
clothes
and
books
or
as
remote
and
intangible
as
shares
in
a
gold
mine
or
rubber
plantation
it
is
idle
therefore
to
present
a
case
for
or
against
private
property
without
specifying
the
particular
forms
of
property
to
which
reference
is
made
and
the
journalist
who
says
that
private
property
is
the
foundation
of
civilization
agrees
with
proudhon
who
said
it
was
theft
in
this
respect
at
least
that
without
further
definition
the
words
of
both
are
meaningless
arguments
which
support
or
demolish
certain
kinds
of
property
may
have
no
application
to
others
considerations
which
are
conclusive
in
one
stage
of
economic
organization
may
be
almost
irrelevant
in
the
next
the
course
of
wisdom
is
neither
to
attack
private
property
in
general
nor
to
defend
it
in
general
for
things
are
not
similar
in
quality
merely
because
they
are
identical
in
name
it
is
to
discriminate
between
the
various
concrete
embodiments
of
what
in
itself
is
after
all
little
more
than
an
abstraction
the
origin
and
development
of
different
kinds
of
proprietary
rights
is
not
material
to
this
discussion
whatever
may
have
been
the
historical
process
by
which
they
have
been
established
and
recognized
the
of
private
property
traditional
in
england
is
that
which
sees
in
it
the
security
that
each
man
will
reap
where
he
has
sown
if
i
despair
of
enjoying
the
fruits
of

said
bentham
repeating
what
were
in
all
essentials
the
arguments

to

shall
not

labors
which

only
benefit

property
it
is
argued
is
a
moral
right
and
not
merely
a
legal
right
because
it
insures
that
the
producer
will
not
be
deprived
by
violence
of
the
result
of
his
efforts
the
period
from
which
that
doctrine
was
inherited
differed
from
our
own
in
three
obvious
but
significant
respects
property
in
land
and
in
the
simple
capital
used
in
most
industries
was
widely
distributed
before
the
rise
of
capitalist
agriculture
and
capitalist
industry
the
ownership
or
at
any
rate
the
secure
and
effective
occupation
of
land
and
tools
by
those
who
used
them
was
a
condition
precedent
to
effective
work
in
the
field
or
in
the
workshop
the
forces
which
threatened
property
were
the
fiscal
policy
of
governments
and
in
some
countries
for
example
france
the
decaying
relics
of
feudalism
the
interference
both
of
the
one
and
of
the
other
involved
the
sacrifice
of
those
who
carried
on
useful
labor
to
those
who
did
not
to
resist
them
was
to
protect
not
only
property
but
industry
which
was
indissolubly
connected
with
it
too
often
indeed
resistance
was
ineffective
accustomed
to
the
misery
of
the
rural
proprietor
in
france
voltaire
remarked
with
astonishment
that
in
england
the
peasant
may
be
rich
and
does
not
fear
to
increase
the
number
of
his
beasts
or
to
cover
his
roof
with
tiles
and
the
english
parliamentarians
and
the
french
philosophers
who
made
the
inviolability
of
property
rights
the
center
of
their
political
theory
when
they
defended
those
who
owned
were
incidentally
if
sometimes
unintentionally
defending
those
who
labored
they
were
protecting
the
yeoman
or
the
master
craftsman
or
the
merchant
from
seeing
the
fruits
of
his
toil
squandered
by
the
at
james
or
the
courtly
parasites
of
versailles
in
such
circumstances
the
doctrine
which
found
the
justification
of
private
property
in
the
fact
that
it
enabled
the
industrious
man
to
reap
where
he
had
sown
was
not
a
paradox
but
as
far
as
the
mass
of
the
population
was
concerned
almost
a
truism
property
was
defended
as
the
most
sacred
of
rights
but
it
was
defended
as
a
right
which
was
not
only
widely
exercised
but
which
was
indispensable
to
the
performance
of
the
active
function
of
providing
food
and
clothing
for
it
consisted
predominantly
of
one
of
two
types
land
or
tools
which
were
used
by
the
owner
for
the
purpose
of
production
and
personal
possessions
which
were
the
necessities
or
amenities
of
civilized
existence
the
former
had
its
in
the
fact
that
the
land
of
the
peasant
or
the
tools
of
the
craftsman
were
the
condition
of
his
rendering
the
economic
services
which
society
required
the
latter
because
furniture
and
clothes
are
indispensable
to
a
life
of
decency
and
comfort
the
proprietary
rights
and
of
course
they
were
numerous
which
had
their
source
not
in
work
but
in
predatory
force
were
protected
from
criticism
by
the
wide
distribution
of
some
kind
of
property
among
the
mass
of
the
population
and
in
england
at
least
the
cruder
of
them
were
gradually
whittled
down
when
property
in
land
and
what
simple
capital
existed
were
generally
diffused
among
all
classes
of
society
when
in
most
parts
of
england
the
typical
workman
was
not
a
laborer
but
a
peasant
or
small
master
who
could
point
to
the
strips
which
he
had
plowed
or
the
cloth
which
he
had
woven
when
the
greater
part
of
the
wealth
passing
at
death
consisted
of
land
household
furniture
and
a
stock
in
trade
which
was
hardly
distinguishable
from
it
the
moral
justification
of
the
title
to
property
was
it
was
obviously
what
theorists
said
that
it
was
and
plain
men
knew
it
to
be
the
labor
spent
in
producing
acquiring
and
administering
it
such
property
was
not
a
burden
upon
society
but
a
condition
of
its
health
and
efficiency
and
indeed
of
its
continued
existence
to
protect
it
was
to
maintain
the
organization
through
which
public
necessities
were
supplied
if
as
in
tudor
england
the
peasant
was
evicted
from
his
holding
to
make
room
for
sheep
or
crushed
as
in
eighteenth
century
france
by
arbitrary
taxation
and
seigneurial
dues
land
went
out
of
cultivation
and
the
whole
community
was
short
of
food
if
the
tools
of
the
carpenter
or
smith
were
seized
plows
were
not
repaired
or
horses
shod
hence
before
the
rise
of
a
commercial
civilization
it
was
the
mark
of
statesmanship
alike
in
the
england
of
the
tudors
and
in
the
france
of
henry
iv
to
cherish
the
small
even
to
the
point
of
offending
the
great
popular
sentiment
idealized
the
yeoman
the
joseph
of
the
country
who
keeps
the
poor
from
starving
not
merely
because
he
owned
property
but
because
he
worked
on
it
denounced
that
bringing
of
the
livings
of
many
into
the
hands
of
one
which
capitalist
societies
regard
with
equanimity
as
an
inevitable
and
apparently
a
laudable
result
of
economic
development
cursed
the
usurer
who
took
advantage
of
his
neighbor
necessities
to
live
without
labor
was
shocked
by
the
callous
indifference
to
public
welfare
shown
by
those
who
not
having
before
their
eyes
either
god
or
the
profit
and
advantage
of
the
realm
have
enclosed
with
hedges
and
dykes
towns
and
hamlets
and
was
sufficiently
powerful
to
compel
governments
to
intervene
to
prevent
the
laying
of
field
to
field
and
the
engrossing
of
looms
to
set
limits
in
short
to
the
scale
to
which
property
might
grow
when
bacon
who
commended
henry
vii
for
protecting
the
tenant
right
of
the
small
farmer
and
pleaded
in
the
house
of
commons
for
more
drastic
land
legislation
wrote
wealth
is
like
muck
it
is
not
good
but
if
it
be
spread
he
was
expressing
in
an
epigram
what
was
the
commonplace
of
every
writer
on
politics
from
fortescue
at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
to
harrington
in
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
the
modern
conservative
who
is
inclined
to
take
pied
de
la
the
vigorous
argument
in
which
lord
hugh
cecil
denounces
the
doctrine
that
the
maintenance
of
proprietary
rights
ought
to
be
contingent
upon
the
use
to
which
they
are
put
may
be
reminded
that
lord
hugh
own
theory
is
of
a
kind
to
make
his
ancestors
turn
in
their
graves
of
the
two
members
of
the
family
who
achieved
distinction
before
the
nineteenth
century
the
elder
advised
the
crown
to
prevent
landlords
evicting
tenants
and
actually
proposed
to
fix
a
pecuniary
maximum
to
the
property
which
different
classes
might
possess
while
the
younger
attacked
enclosing
in
parliament
and
carried
legislation
compelling
landlords
to
build
cottages
to
let
them
with
small
holdings
and
to
plow
up
pasture
william
and
robert
cecil
were
sagacious
and
responsible
men
and
their
view
that
the
protection
of
property
should
be
accompanied
by
the
enforcement
of
obligations
upon
its
owners
was
shared
by
most
of
their
contemporaries
the
idea
that
the
institution
of
private
property
involves
the
right
of
the
owner
to
use
it
or
refrain
from
using
it
in
such
a
way
as
he
may
please
and
that
its
principal
significance
is
to
supply
him
with
an
income
irrespective
of
any
duties
which
he
may
discharge
would
not
have
been
understood
by
most
public
men
of
that
age
and
if
understood
would
have
been
repudiated
with
indignation
by
the
more
reputable
among
them
they
found
the
meaning
of
property
in
the
public
purposes
to
which
it
contributed
whether
they
were
the
production
of
food
as
among
the
peasantry
or
the
management
of
public
affairs
as
among
the
gentry
and
hesitated
neither
to
maintain
those
kinds
of
property
which
met
these
obligations
nor
to
repress
those
uses
of
it
which
appeared
likely
to
conflict
with
them
property
was
to
be
an
aid
to
creative
work
not
an
alternative
to
it
the
patentee
was
secured
protection
for
a
new
invention
in
order
to
secure
him
the
fruits
of
his
own
brain
but
the
monopolist
who
grew
fat
on
the
industry
of
others
was
to
be
put
down
the
law
of
the
village
bound
the
peasant
to
use
his
land
not
as
he
himself
might
find
most
profitable
but
to
grow
the
corn
the
village
needed
long
after
political
changes
had
made
direct
interference
impracticable
even
the
higher
ranks
of
english
landowners
continued
to
discharge
however
capriciously
and
tyrannically
duties
which
were
vaguely
felt
to
be
the
contribution
which
they
made
to
the
public
service
in
virtue
of
their
estates
when
as
in
france
the
obligations
of
ownership
were
repudiated
almost
as
completely
as
they
have
been
by
the
owner
of
nemesis
came
in
an
onslaught
upon
the
position
of
a
which
had
retained
its
rights
and
abdicated
its
functions
property
reposed
in
short
not
merely
upon
convenience
or
the
appetite
for
gain
but
on
a
moral
principle
it
was
protected
not
only
for
the
sake
of
those
who
owned
but
for
the
sake
of
those
who
worked
and
of
those
for
whom
their
work
provided
it
was
protected
because
without
security
for
property
wealth
could
not
be
produced
or
the
business
of
society
carried
on
whatever
the
future
may
contain
the
past
has
shown
no
more
excellent
social
order
than
that
in
which
the
mass
of
the
people
were
the
masters
of
the
holdings
which
they
plowed
and
of
the
tools
with
which
they
worked
and
could
boast
with
the
english
freeholder
that
it
is
a
quietness
to
a
man
mind
to
live
upon
his
own
and
to
know
his
heir
certain
with
this
conception
of
property
and
its
practical
expression
in
social
institutions
those
who
urge
that
society
should
be
organized
on
the
basis
of
function
have
no
quarrel
it
is
in
agreement
with
their
own
doctrine
since
it
justifies
property
by
reference
to
the
services
which
it
enables
its
owner
to
perform
all
that
they
need
ask
is
that
it
should
be
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion
for
the
argument
has
evidently
more
than
one
edge
if
it
justifies
certain
types
of
property
it
condemns
others
and
in
the
conditions
of
modern
industrial
civilization
what
it
justifies
is
less
than
what
it
condemns
the
truth
is
indeed
that
this
theory
of
property
and
the
institutions
in
which
it
is
embodied
have
survived
into
an
age
in
which
the
whole
structure
of
society
is
radically
different
from
that
in
which
it
was
formulated
and
which
made
it
a
valid
argument
if
not
for
all
at
least
for
the
most
common
and
characteristic
kinds
of
property
it
is
not
merely
that
the
ownership
of
any
substantial
share
in
the
national
wealth
is
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
a
few
hundred
thousand
families
and
that
at
the
end
of
an
age
which
began
with
an
affirmation
of
the
rights
of
property
proprietary
rights
are
in
fact
far
from
being
widely
distributed
nor
is
it
merely
that
what
makes
property
insecure
is
not
the
arbitrary
taxation
of
unconstitutional
monarchies
or
the
privileges
of
an
idle
but
the
insatiable
expansion
and
aggregation
of
property
itself
which
menaces
with
absorption
all
property
less
than
the
greatest
the
small
master
the
little
shopkeeper
the
country
bank
and
has
turned
the
mass
of
mankind
into
a
proletariat
working
under
the
agents
and
for
the
profit
of
those
who
own
the
characteristic
fact
which
differentiates
most
modern
property
from
that
of
the
age
and
which
turns
against
it
the
very
reasoning
by
which
formerly
it
was
supported
is
that
in
modern
economic
conditions
ownership
is
not
active
but
passive
that
to
most
of
those
who
own
property
it
is
not
a
means
of
work
but
an
instrument
for
the
acquisition
of
gain
or
the
exercise
of
power
and
that
there
is
no
guarantee
that
gain
bears
any
relation
to
service
or
power
to
responsibility
for
property
which
can
be
regarded
as
a
condition
of
the
performance
of
function
like
the
tools
of
the
craftsman
or
the
holding
of
the
peasant
or
the
personal
possessions
which
contribute
to
a
life
of
health
and
efficiency
forms
an
insignificant
proportion
as
far
as
its
value
is
concerned
of
the
property
rights
existing
at
present
in
modern
industrial
societies
the
great
mass
of
property
consists
as
the
annual
review
of
wealth
passing
at
death
reveals
neither
of
personal
acquisitions
such
as
household
furniture
nor
of
the
owner
but
of
rights
of
various
kinds
such
as
royalties
and
above
all
of
course
shares
in
industrial
undertakings
which
yield
an
income
irrespective
of
any
personal
service
rendered
by
their
owners
ownership
and
use
are
normally
divorced
the
greater
part
of
modern
property
has
been
attenuated
to
a
pecuniary
lien
or
bond
on
the
product
of
industry
which
carries
with
it
a
right
to
payment
but
which
is
normally
valued
precisely
because
it
relieves
the
owner
from
any
obligation
to
perform
a
positive
or
constructive
function
such
property
may
be
called
passive
property
or
property
for
acquisition
for
exploitation
or
for
power
to
distinguish
it
from
the
property
which
is
actively
used
by
its
owner
for
the
conduct
of
his
profession
or
the
upkeep
of
his
household
to
the
lawyer
the
first
is
of
course
as
fully
property
as
the
second
it
is
questionable
however
whether
economists
shall
call
it
property
at
all
and
not
rather
as
hobson
has
suggested
improperty
since
it
is
not
identical
with
the
rights
which
secure
the
owner
the
produce
of
his
toil
but
is
opposite
of
them
a
classification
of
proprietary
rights
based
upon
this
difference
would
be
instructive
if
they
were
arranged
according
to
the
closeness
with
which
they
approximate
to
one
or
other
of
these
two
extremes
it
would
be
found
that
they
were
spread
along
a
line
stretching
from
property
which
is
obviously
the
payment
for
and
condition
of
personal
services
to
property
which
is
merely
a
right
to
payment
from
the
services
rendered
by
others
in
fact
a
private
tax
the
rough
order
which
would
emerge
if
all
details
and
qualification
were
omitted
might
be
something
as
follows
property
in
payments
made
for
personal
services
property
in
personal
possessions
necessary
to
health
and
comfort
property
in
land
and
tools
used
by
their
owners
property
in
copyright
and
patent
rights
owned
by
authors
and
inventors
property
in
pure
interest
including
much
agricultural
rent
property
in
profits
of
luck
and
good
fortune
property
in
monopoly
profits
property
in
urban
ground
rents
property
in
royalties
the
first
four
kinds
of
property
obviously
accompany
and
in
some

the
crucial
question
for
any
society
is
under
which
each
of
these
two
broad
groups
of
categories
the
greater
part
measured
in
value
of
the
proprietary
rights
which
it
maintains
are
at
any
given
moment
to
be
found
if
they
fall
in
the
first
group
creative
work
will
be
encouraged
and
idleness
will
be
depressed
if
they
fall
in
the
second
the
result
will
be
the
reverse
the
facts
vary
widely
from
age
to
age
and
from
country
to
country
nor
have
they
ever
been
fully
revealed
for
the
lords
of

jungle

not
hunt
by

it
is
probable
at
least
that
in
the
england
of
to
a
larger
proportion
of
the
existing
property
consisted
of
land
and
tools
used
by
their
owners
than
either
in
contemporary
france
where
feudal
dues
absorbed
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
peasants
income
or
than
in
the
england
of
to
where
the
new
capitalist
manufacturers
made
hundreds
per
cent
while
manual
workers
were
goaded
by
starvation
into
ineffectual
revolt
it
is
probable
that
in
the
nineteenth
century
thanks
to
the
revolution
france
and
england
changed
places
and
that
in
this
respect
not
only
ireland
but
the
british
dominions
resemble
the
former
rather
than
the
latter
the
transformation
can
be
studied
best
of
all
in
the
united
states
in
parts
of
which
the
population
of
peasant
proprietors
and
small
masters
of
the
early
nineteenth
century
were
replaced
in
three
generations
by
a
propertyless
proletariat
and
a
capitalist
plutocracy
the
abolition
of
the
economic
privileges
of
agrarian
feudalism
which
under
the
name
of
equality
was
the
driving
force
of
the
french
revolution
and
which
has
taken
place
in
one
form
or
another
in
all
countries
touched
by
its
influence
has
been
largely
since
by
the
growth
of
the
inequalities
springing
from
industrialism
in
england
the
general
effect
of
recent
economic
development
has
been
to
swell
proprietary
rights
which
entitle
the
owners
to
payment
without
work
and
to
diminish
those
which
can
properly
be
described
as
functional
the
expansion
of
the
former
and
the
process
by
which
the
simpler
forms
of
property
have
been
merged
in
them
are
movements
the
significance
of
which
it
is
hardly
possible
to
there
is
of
course
a
considerable
body
of
property
which
is
still
of
the
older
type
but
though
working
landlords
and
capitalists
who
manage
their
own
businesses
are
still
in
the
aggregate
a
numerous
body
the
organization
for
which
they
stand
is
not
that
which
is
most
representative
of
the
modern
economic
world
the
general
tendency
for
the
ownership
and
administration
of
property
to
be
separated
the
general
refinement
of
property
into
a
claim
on
goods
produced
by
an
unknown
worker
is
as
unmistakable
as
the
growth
of
capitalist
industry
and
urban
civilization
themselves
villages
are
turned
into
towns
and
property
in
land
changes
from
the
holding
worked
by
a
farmer
or
the
estate
administered
by
a
landlord
into
rents
which
are
advertised
and
bought
and
sold
like
any
other
investment
mines
are
opened
and
the
rights
of
the
landowner
are
converted
into
a
tribute
for
every
ton
of
coal
which
is
brought
to
the
surface
as
companies
take
the
place
of
the
individual
enterprise
which
was
typical
of
the
earlier
years
of
the
factory
system
organization
passes
from
the
employer
who
both
owns
and
manages
his
business
into
the
hands
of
salaried
officials
and
again
the
mass
of
is
swollen
by
the
multiplication
of
who
put
their
wealth
at
the
disposal
of
industry
but
who
have
no
other
connection
with
it
the
change
is
taking
place
in
our
day
most
conspicuously
perhaps
through
the
displacement
in
retail
trade
of
the
small
shopkeeper
by
the
multiple
store
and
the
substitution
in
manufacturing
industry
of
combines
and
amalgamations
for
separate
businesses
conducted
by
competing
employers
and
of
course
it
is
not
only
by
economic
development
that
such
claims
are
created
out
of
the
eater
came
forth
meat
and
out
of
the
strong
came
forth
sweetness
it
is
probable
that
war
which
in
barbarous
ages
used
to
be
blamed
as
destructive
of
property
has
recently
created
more
titles
to
property
than
almost
all
other
causes
put
together
infinitely
diverse
as
are
these
proprietary
rights
they
have
the
common
characteristic
of
being
so
entirely
separated
from
the
actual
objects
over
which
they
are
exercised
so
rarified
and
generalized
as
to
be
analogous
almost
to
a
form
of
currency
rather
than
to
the
property
which
is
so
closely
united
to
its
owner
as
to
seem
a
part
of
him
their
isolation
from
the
rough
environment
of
economic
life
where
the
material
objects
of
which
they
are
the
symbol
are
shaped
and
handled
is
their
charm
it
is
also
their
danger
the
hold
which
a
class
has
upon
the
future
depends
on
the
function
which
it
performs
what
nature
demands
is
work
few
working
aristocracies
however
tyrannical
have
fallen
few
functionless
aristocracies
have
survived
in
society
as
in
the
world
of
organic
life
atrophy
is
but
one
stage
removed
from
death
in
proportion
as
the
landowner
becomes
a
mere
and
industry
is
conducted
not
by
the
rude
energy
of
the
competing
employers
who
dominated
its
infancy
but
by
the
salaried
servants
of
shareholders
the
argument
for
private
property
which
reposes
on
the
impossibility
of
finding
any
organization
to
supersede
them
loses
its
application
for
they
are
already
superseded
whatever
may
be
the
justification
of
these
types
of
property
it
can
not
be
that
which
was
given
for
the
property
of
the
peasant
or
the
craftsman
it
can
not
be
that
they
are
necessary
in
order
to
secure
to
each
man
the
fruits
of
his
own
labor
for
if
a
legal
right
which
gives
a
year
to
a
mineral
owner
in
the
north
of
england
and
to
a
ground
landlord
in
london
secures
the
fruits
of
labor
at
all
the
fruits
are
the
proprietor
and
the
labor
that
of
some
one
else
property
has
no
more
insidious
enemies
than
those
anarchists
who
by
defending
all
forms
of
it
as
equally
valid
involve
the
institution
in
the
discredit
attaching
to
its
extravagances
in
reality
whatever
conclusion
may
be
drawn
from
the
fact
the
greater
part
of
modern
property
whether
like
mineral
rights
and
urban
it
is
merely
a
form
of
private
taxation
which
the
law
allows
certain
persons
to
levy
on
the
industry
of
others
or
whether
like
property
in
capital
it
consists
of
rights
to
payment
for
instruments
which
the
capitalist
can
not
himself
use
but
puts
at
the
disposal
of
those
who
can
has
as
its
essential
feature
that
it
confers
upon
its
owners
income
unaccompanied
by
personal
service
in
this
respect
the
ownership
of
land
and
the
ownership
of
capital
are
normally
similar
though
from
other
points
of
view
their
differences
are
important
to
the
economist
rent
and
interest
are
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
the
latter
though
it
is
often
accompanied
by
surplus
elements
which
are
merged
with
it
in
dividends
is
the
price
of
an
instrument
of
production
which
would
not
be
forthcoming
for
industry
if
the
price
were
not
paid
while
the
former
is
a
differential
surplus
which
does
not
affect
the
supply
to
the
business
community
and
the
solicitor
land
and
capital
are
equally
investments
between
which
since
they
possess
the
common
characteristic
of
yielding
income
without
labor
it
is
inequitable
to
discriminate
and
though
their
significance
as
economic
categories
may
be
different
their
effect
as
social
institutions
is
the
same
it
is
to
separate
property
from
creative
ability
and
to
divide
society
into
two
classes
of
which
one
has
its
primary
interest
in
passive
ownership
while
the
other
is
mainly
dependent
upon
active
work
hence
the
real
analogy
to
many
kinds
of
modern
property
is
not
the
simple
property
of
the
small
or
the
craftsman
still
less
the
household
goods
and
dear
domestic
amenities
which
is
what
the
word
suggests
to
the
guileless
minds
of
clerks
and
shopkeepers
and
which
stampede
them
into
displaying
the
ferocity
of
terrified
sheep
when
the
cry
is
raised
that
property
is
threatened
it
is
the
feudal
dues
which
robbed
the
french
peasant
of
part
of
his
produce
till
the
revolution
abolished
them
how
do
royalties
differ
from
and
et
they
are
similar
in
their
origin
and
similar
in
being
a
tax
levied
on
each
increment
of
wealth
which
labor
produces
how
do
urban
differ
from
the
payments
which
were
made
to
english
sinecurists
before
the
reform
bill
of
they
are
equally
tribute
paid
by
those
who
work
to
those
who
do
not
if
the
monopoly
profits
of
the
owner
of
whose
tenant
must
grind
corn
at
his
mill
and
make
wine
at
his
press
were
an
intolerable
oppression
what
is
the
sanctity
attaching
to
the
monopoly
profits
of
the
capitalists
who
as
the
report
of
the
government
committee
on
trusts
tells
us
in
soap
tobacco
wallpaper
salt
cement
and
in
the
textile
trades
are
in
a
position
to
control
output
and
prices
or
in
other
words
can
compel
the
consumer
to
buy
from
them
at
the
figure
they
fix
on
pain
of
not
buying
at
all
all
these
rights
royalties
monopoly
profits
are
property
the
criticism
most
fatal
to
them
is
not
that
of
socialists
it
is
contained
in
the
arguments
by
which
property
is
usually
defended
for
if
the
meaning
of
the
institution
is
to
encourage
industry
by
securing
that
the
worker
shall
receive
the
produce
of
his
toil
then
precisely
in
proportion
as
it
is
important
to
preserve
the
property
which
a
man
has
in
the
results
of
his
own
efforts
is
it
important
to
abolish
that
which
he
has
in
the
results
of
the
efforts
of
some
one
else
the
considerations
which
justify
ownership
as
a
function
are
those
which
condemn
it
as
a
tax
property
is
not
theft
but
a
good
deal
of
theft
becomes
property
the
owner
of
royalties
who
when
asked
why
he
should
be
paid
a
year
from
minerals
which
he
has
neither
discovered
nor
developed
nor
worked
but
only
owned
replies
but
it
property
may
feel
all
the
awe
which
his
language
suggests
but
in
reality
he
is
behaving
like
the
snake
which
sinks
into
its
background
by
pretending
that
it
is
the
dead
branch
of
a
tree
or
the
lunatic
who
tried
to
catch
rabbits
by
sitting
behind
a
hedge
and
making
a
noise
like
a
turnip
he
is
practising
protective
and
sometimes
aggressive
mimicry
his
sentiments
about
property
are
those
of
the
simple
toiler
who
fears
that
what
he
has
sown
another
may
reap
his
claim
is
to
be
allowed
to
continue
to
reap
what
another
has
sown
it
is
sometimes
suggested
that
the
less
attractive
characteristics
of
our
industrial
civilization
its
combination
of
luxury
and
squalor
its
class
divisions
and
class
warfare
are
accidental
maladjustments
which
are
not
rooted
in
the
center
of
its
being
but
are
excrescences
which
economic
progress
itself
may
in
time
be
expected
to
correct
that
agreeable
optimism
will
not
survive
an
examination
of
the
operation
of
the
institution
of
private
property
in
land
and
capital
in
industrialized
communities
in
countries
where
land
is
widely
distributed
in
france
or
in
ireland
its
effect
may
be
to
produce
a
general
diffusion
of
wealth
among
a
rural
middle
class
who
at
once
work
and
own
in
countries
where
the
development
of
industrial
organization
has
separated
the
ownership
of
property
and
the
performance
of
work
the
normal
effect
of
private
property
is
to
transfer
to
functionless
owners
the
surplus
arising
from
the
more
fertile
sites
the
better
machinery
the
more
elaborate
organization
no
clearer
exemplifications
of
this
law
of
rent
has
been
given
than
the
figures
supplied
to
the
coal
industry
commission
by
sir
arthur
lowes
dickenson
which
showed
that
in
a
given
quarter
the
costs
per
ton
of
producing
coal
varied
from
to
per
ton
and
the
profits
from
nil
to
the
distribution
in
dividends
to
shareholders
of
the
surplus
accruing
from
the
working
of
richer
and
more
accessible
seams
from
special
opportunities
and
access
to
markets
from
superior
machinery
management
and
organization
involves
the
establishment
of
privilege
as
a
national
institution
as
much
as
the
most
arbitrary
exactions
of
a
feudal
it
is
the
foundation
of
an
inequality
which
is
not
accidental
or
temporary
but
necessary
and
permanent
and
on
this
inequality
is
erected
the
whole
apparatus
of
class
institutions
which
make
not
only
the
income
but
the
housing
education
health
and
manners
indeed
the
very
physical
appearance
of
different
classes
of
englishmen
almost
as
different
from
each
other
as
though
the
minority
were
alien
settlers
established
amid
the
rude
civilization
of
a
race
of
impoverished
aborigines
so
the
justification
of
private
property
traditional
in
england
which
saw
in
it
the
security
that
each
man
would
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
own
labor
though
largely
applicable
to
the
age
in
which
it
was
formulated
has
undergone
the
fate
of
most
political
theories
it
has
been
refuted
not
by
the
doctrines
of
rival
philosophers
but
by
the
prosaic
course
of
economic
development
as
far
as
the
mass
of
mankind
are
concerned
the
need
which
private
property
other
than
personal
possessions
does
still
often
satisfy
though
imperfectly
and
precariously
is
the
need
for
security
to
the
small
investors
who
are
the
majority
of
though
owning
only
an
insignificant
fraction
of
the
property
in
existence
its
meaning
is
simple
it
is
not
wealth
or
power
or
even
leisure
from
work
it
is
safety
they
work
hard
they
save
a
little
money
for
old
age
or
for
sickness
or
for
their
children
they
invest
it
and
the
interest
stands
between
them
and
all
that
they
dread
most
their
savings
are
of
convenience
to
industry
the
income
from
them
is
convenient
to
themselves
why
they
ask
should
we
not
reap
in
old
age
the
advantage
of
energy
and
thrift
in
youth
and
this
hunger
for
security
is
so
imperious
that
those
who
suffer
most
from
the
abuses
of
property
as
well
as
those
who
if
they
could
profit
by
them
would
be
least
inclined
to
do
so
will
tolerate
and
even
defend
them
for
fear
lest
the
knife
which
trims
dead
matter
should
cut
into
the
quick
they
have
seen
too
many
men
drown
to
be
critical
of
dry
land
though
it
be
an
inhospitable
rock
they
are
haunted
by
the
nightmare
of
the
future
and
if
a
burglar
broke
it
would
welcome
a
burglar
this
need
for
security
is
fundamental
and
almost
the
gravest
indictment
of
our
civilization
is
that
the
mass
of
mankind
are
without
it
property
is
one
way
of
organizing
it
it
is
quite
comprehensible
therefore
that
the
instrument
should
be
confused
with
the
end
and
that
any
proposal
to
modify
it
should
create
dismay
in
the
past
human
beings
roads
bridges
and
ferries
civil
judicial
and
clerical
offices
and
commissions
in
the
army
have
all
been
private
property
whenever
it
was
proposed
to
abolish
the
rights
exercised
over
them
it
was
protested
that
their
removal
would
involve
the
destruction
of
an
institution
in
which
thrifty
men
had
invested
their
savings
and
on
which
they
depended
for
protection
amid
the
chances
of
life
and
for
comfort
in
old
age
in
fact
however
property
is
not
the
only
method
of
assuring
the
future
nor
when
it
is
the
way
selected
is
security
dependent
upon
the
maintenance
of
all
the
rights
which
are
at
present
normally
involved
in
ownership
in
so
far
as
its
psychological
foundation
is
the
necessity
for
securing
an
income
which
is
stable
and
certain
which
is
forthcoming
when
its
recipient
can
not
work
and
which
can
be
used
to
provide
for
those
who
can
not
provide
for
themselves
what
is
really
demanded
is
not
the
command
over
the
fluctuating
proceeds
of
some
particular
undertaking
which
accompanies
the
ownership
of
capital
but
the
security
which
is
offered
by
an
annuity
property
is
the
instrument
security
is
the
object
and
when
some
alternative
way
is
forthcoming
of
providing
the
latter
it
does
not
appear
in
practice
that
any
loss
of
confidence
or
freedom
or
independence
is
caused
by
the
absence
of
the
former
hence
not
only
the
manual
workers
who
since
the
rise
of
capitalism
have
rarely
in
england
been
able
to
accumulate
property
sufficient
to
act
as
a
guarantee
of
income
when
their
period
of
active
earning
is
past
but
also
the
middle
and
professional
classes
increasingly
seek
security
not
in
investment
but
in
insurance
against
sickness
and
death
in
the
purchase
of
annuities
or
in
what
is
in
effect
the
same
thing
the
accumulation
of
part
of
their
salary
towards
a
pension
which
is
paid
when
their
salary
ceases
the
professional
man
may
buy
shares
in
the
hope
of
making
a
profit
on
the
transaction
but
when
what
he
desires
to
buy
is
security
the
form
which
his
investment
takes
is
usually
one
kind
or
another
of
insurance
the
teacher
or
nurse
or
government
servant
looks
forward
to
a
pension
women
who
fifty
years
ago
would
have
been
regarded
as
dependent
almost
as
completely
as
if
femininity
were
an
incurable
disease
with
which
they
had
been
born
and
whose
fathers
unless
rich
men
would
have
been
tormented
with
anxiety
for
fear
lest
they
should
not
save
sufficient
to
provide
for
them
now
receive
an
education
support
themselves
in
professions
and
save
in
the
same
way
it
is
still
only
in
comparatively
few
cases
that
this
type
of
provision
is
made
almost
all
outside
government
employment
and
many
in
it
as
well
as
large
numbers
of
professional
men
have
nothing
to
fall
back
upon
in
sickness
or
old
age
but
that
does
not
alter
the
fact
that
when
it
is
made
it
meets
the
need
for
security
which
apart
of
course
from
personal
possessions
and
household
furniture
is
the
principal
meaning
of
property
to
by
far
the
largest
element
in
the
population
and
that
it
meets
it
more
completely
and
certainly
than
property
itself
nor
indeed
even
when
property
is
the
instrument
used
to
provide
for
the
future
is
such
provision
dependent
upon
the
maintenance
in
its
entirety
of
the
whole
body
of
rights
which
accompany
ownership
property
is
not
simple
but
complex
that
of
a
man
who
has
invested
his
savings
as
an
ordinary
shareholder
comprises
at
least
three
rights
the
right
to
interest
the
right
to
profits
the
right
to
control
in
so
far
as
what
is
desired
is
the
guarantee
for
the
maintenance
of
a
stable
income
not
the
acquisition
of
additional
wealth
without
labor
in
so
far
as
his
motive
is
not
gain
but
security
the
need
is
met
by
interest
on
capital
it
has
no
necessary
connection
either
with
the
right
to
residuary
profits
or
the
right
to
control
the
management
of
the
undertaking
from
which
the
profits
are
derived
both
of
which
are
vested
in
the
shareholder
if
all
that
were
desired
were
to
use
property
as
an
instrument
for
purchasing
security
the
obvious
course
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
investor
desiring
to
insure
his
future
the
safest
course
would
be
to
assimilate
his
position
as
far
as
possible
to
that
of
a
debenture
holder
or
mortgagee
who
obtains
the
stable
income
which
is
his
motive
for
investment
but
who
neither
incurs
the
risks
nor
receives
the
profits
of
the
speculator
to
insist
that
the
elaborate
apparatus
of
proprietary
rights
which
distributes
dividends
of
thirty
per
cent
to
the
shareholders
in
coats
and
several
thousands
a
year
to
the
owner
of
mineral
royalties
and
and
then
allows
them
to
transmit
the
bulk
of
gains
which
they
have
not
earned
to
descendants
who
in
their
turn
will
thus
be
relieved
from
the
necessity
of
earning
must
be
maintained
for
the
sake
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
the
vast
majority
of
whom
have
neither
and
would
gladly
part
with
them
all
for
a
safe
annuity
if
they
had
is
to
say
the
least
of
it
extravagantly
it
is
like
pitching
a
man
into
the
water
because
he
expresses
a
wish
for
a
bath
or
presenting
a
tiger
cub
to
a
householder
who
is
plagued
with
mice
on
the
ground
that
tigers
and
cats
both
belong
to
the
genus
the
tiger
hunts
for
itself
not
for
its
masters
and
when
game
is
scarce
will
hunt
them
the
classes
who
own
little
or
no
property
may
reverence
it
because
it
is
security
but
the
classes
who
own
much
prize
it
for
quite
different
reasons
and
laugh
in
their
sleeve
at
the
innocence
which
supposes
that
anything
as
vulgar
as
the
savings
of
the
have
except
at
elections
any
interest
for
them
they
prize
it
because
it
is
the
order
which
quarters
them
on
the
community
and
which
provides
for
the
maintenance
of
a
leisure
class
at
the
public
expense
possession
said
the
egoist
without
obligation
to
the
object
possessed
approaches
felicity
functionless
property
appears
natural
to
those
who
believe
that
society
should
be
organized
for
the
acquisition
of
private
wealth
and
attacks
upon
it
perverse
or
malicious
because
the
question
which
they
ask
of
any
institution
is
what
does
it
yield
and
such
property
yields
much
to
those
who
own
it
those
however
who
hold
that
social
unity
and
effective
work
are
possible
only
if
society
is
organized
and
wealth
distributed
on
the
basis
of
function
will
ask
of
an
institution
not
what
dividends
does
it
pay
but
what
service
does
it
perform
to
them
the
fact
that
much
property
yields
income
irrespective
of
any
service
which
is
performed
or
obligation
which
is
recognized
by
its
owners
will
appear
not
a
quality
but
a
vice
they
will
see
in
the
social
confusion
which
it
produces
payments
disproportionate
to
service
here
and
payments
without
any
service
at
all
there
and
dissatisfaction
everywhere
a
convincing
confirmation
of
their
argument
that
to
build
on
a
foundation
of
rights
and
of
rights
alone
is
to
build
on
a
quicksand
from
the
portentous
exaggeration
into
an
absolute
of
what
once
was
and
still
might
be
a
sane
and
social
institution
most
other
social
evils
follow
the
power
of
those
who
do
not
work
over
those
who
do
the
alternate
subservience
and
rebelliousness
of
those
who
work
towards
those
who
do
not
the
starving
of
science
and
thought
and
creative
effort
for
fear
that
expenditure
upon
them
should
impinge
on
the
comfort
of
the
sluggard
and
the
and
the
arrangement
of
society
in
most
of
its
subsidiary
activities
to
suit
the
convenience
not
of
those
who
work
usefully
but
of
those
who
spend
gaily
so
that
the
most
hideous
desolate
and
parsimonious
places
in
the
country
are
those
in
which
the
greatest
wealth
is
produced
the
clyde
valley
or
the
cotton
towns
of
lancashire
or
the
mining
villages
of
scotland
and
wales
and
the
gayest
and
most
luxurious
those
in
which
it
is
consumed
from
the
point
of
view
of
social
health
and
economic
efficiency
society
should
obtain
its
material
equipment
at
the
cheapest
price
possible
and
after
providing
for
depreciation
and
expansion
should
distribute
the
whole
product
to
its
working
members
and
their
dependents
what
happens
at
present
however
is
that
its
workers
are
hired
at
the
cheapest
price
which
the
market
as
modified
by
organization
allows
and
that
the
surplus
somewhat
diminished
by
taxation
is
distributed
to
the
owners
of
property
profits
may
vary
in
a
given
year
from
a
loss
to
per
cent
but
wages
are
fixed
at
a
level
which
will
enable
the
marginal
firm
to
continue
producing
one
year
with
another
and
the
surplus
even
when
due
partly
to
efficient
management
goes
neither
to
managers
nor
manual
workers
but
to
shareholders
the
meaning
of
the
process
becomes
startlingly
apparent
when
as
in
lancashire
large
blocks
of
capital
change
hands
at
a
period
of
abnormal
activity
the
existing
shareholders
receive
the
equivalent
of
the
capitalized
expectation
of
future
profits
the
workers
as
workers
do
not
participate
in
the
immense
increment
in
value
and
when
in
the
future
they
demand
an
advance
in
wages
they
will
be
met
by
the
answer
that
profits
which
before
the
transaction
would
have
been
reckoned
large
yield
shareholders
after
it
only
a
low
rate
of
interest
on
their
investment
the
truth
is
that
whereas
in
earlier
ages
the
protection
of
property
was
normally
the
protection
of
work
the
relationship
between
them
has
come
in
the
course
of
the
economic
development
of
the
last
two
centuries
to
be
very
nearly
reversed
the
two
elements
which
compose
civilization
are
active
effort
and
passive
property
the
labor
of
human
things
and
the
tools
which
human
beings
use
of
these
two
elements
those
who
supply
the
first
maintain
and
improve
it
those
who
own
the
second
normally
dictate
its
character
its
development
and
its
administration
hence
though
politically
free
the
mass
of
mankind
live
in
effect
under
rules
imposed
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
small
section
among
them
whose
primary
concern
is
ownership
from
this
subordination
of
creative
activity
to
passive
property
the
worker
who
depends
upon
his
brains
the
organizer
inventor
teacher
or
doctor
suffers
almost
as
much
embarrassment
as
the
craftsman
the
real
economic
cleavage
is
not
as
is
often
said
between
employers
and
employed
but
between
all
who
do
constructive
work
from
scientist
to
laborer
on
the
one
hand
and
all
whose
main
interest
is
the
preservation
of
existing
proprietary
rights
upon
the
other
irrespective
of
whether
they
contribute
to
constructive
work
or
not
if
therefore
under
the
modern
conditions
which
have
concentrated
any
substantial
share
of
property
in
the
hands
of
a
small
minority
of
the
population
the
world
is
to
be
governed
for
the
advantages
of
those
who
own
it
is
only
incidentally
and
by
accident
that
the
results
will
be
agreeable
to
those
who
work
in
practice
there
is
a
constant
collision
between
them
turned
into
another
channel
half
the
wealth
distributed
in
dividends
to
functionless
shareholders
could
secure
every
child
a
good
education
up
to
could
english
universities
and
since
more
efficient
production
is
important
could
equip
english
industries
for
more
efficient
production
half
the
ingenuity
now
applied
to
the
protection
of
property
could
have
made
most
industrial
diseases
as
rare
as
smallpox
and
most
english
cities
into
places
of
health
and
even
of
beauty
what
stands
in
the
way
is
the
doctrine
that
the
rights
of
property
are
absolute
irrespective
of
any
social
function
which
its
owners
may
perform
so
the
laws
which
are
most
stringently
enforced
are
still
the
laws
which
protect
property
though
the
protection
of
property
is
no
longer
likely
to
be
equivalent
to
the
protection
of
work
and
the
interests
which
govern
industry
and
predominate
in
public
affairs
are
proprietary
interests
a
may
poison
or
mangle
a
generation
of
operatives
but
his
brother
magistrates
will
let
him
off
with
a
caution
or
a
nominal
fine
to
poison
and
mangle
the
next
for
he
is
an
owner
of
property
a
landowner
may
draw
rents
from
slums
in
which
young
children
die
at
the
rate
of
per
but
he
will
be
none
the
less
welcome
in
polite
society
for
property
has
no
obligations
and
therefore
can
do
no
wrong
urban
land
may
be
held
from
the
market
on
the
outskirts
of
cities
in
which
human
beings
are
living
three
to
a
room
and
rural
land
may
be
used
for
sport
when
villagers
are
leaving
it
to
overcrowd
them
still
more
no
public
authority
intervenes
for
both
are
property
to
those
who
believe
that
institutions
which
repudiate
all
moral
significance
must
sooner
or
later
collapse
a
society
which
confuses
the
protection
of
property
with
the
preservation
of
its
functionless
perversions
will
appear
as
precarious
as
that
which
has
left
the
memorials
of
its
tasteless
frivolity
and
more
tasteless
ostentation
in
the
gardens
of
versailles
do
men
love
peace
they
will
see
the
greatest
enemy
of
social
unity
in
rights
which
involve
no
obligation
to
for
the
service
of
society
do
they
value
equality
property
rights
which
dispense
their
owners
from
the
common
human
necessity
of
labor
make
inequality
an
institution
permeating
every
corner
of
society
from
the
distribution
of
material
wealth
to
the
training
of
intellect
itself
do
they
desire
greater
industrial
efficiency
there
is
no
more
fatal
obstacle
to
efficiency
than
the
revelation
that
idleness
has
the
same
privileges
as
industry
and
that
for
every
additional
blow
with
the
pick
or
hammer
an
additional
profit
will
be
distributed
among
shareholders
who
wield
neither
indeed
functionless
property
is
the
greatest
enemy
of
legitimate
property
itself
it
is
the
parasite
which
kills
the
organism
that
produced
it
bad
money
drives
out
good
and
as
the
history
of
the
last
two
hundred
years
shows
when
property
for
acquisition
or
power
and
property
for
service
or
for
use
jostle
each
other
freely
in
the
market
without
restrictions
such
as
some
legal
systems
have
imposed
on
alienation
and
inheritance
the
latter
tends
normally
to
be
absorbed
by
the
former
because
it
has
less
resisting
power
thus
functionless
property
grows
and
as
it
grows
it
undermines
the
creative
energy
which
produced
property
and
which
in
earlier
ages
it
protected
it
can
not
unite
men
for
what
unites
them
is
the
bond
of
service
to
a
common
purpose
and
that
bond
it
repudiates
since
its
very
essence
is
the
maintenance
of
rights
irrespective
of
service
it
can
not
create
it
can
only
spend
so
that
the
number
of
scientists
inventors
artists
or
men
of
letters
who
have
sprung
in
the
course
of
the
last
century
from
hereditary
riches
can
be
numbered
on
one
hand
it
values
neither
culture
nor
beauty
but
only
the
power
which
belongs
to
wealth
and
the
ostentation
which
is
the
symbol
of
it
so
those
who
dread
these
qualities
energy
and
thought
and
the
creative
spirit
and
they
are
many
will
not
discriminate
as
we
have
tried
to
discriminate
between
different
types
and
kinds
of
property
in
order
that
they
may
preserve
those
which
are
legitimate
and
abolish
those
which
are
not
they
will
endeavor
to
preserve
all
private
property
even
in
its
most
degenerate
forms
and
those
who
value
those
things
will
try
to
promote
them
by
relieving
property
of
its
perversions
and
thus
enabling
it
to
return
to
its
true
nature
they
will
not
desire
to
establish
any
visionary
communism
for
they
will
realize
that
the
free
disposal
of
a
sufficiency
of
personal
possessions
is
the
condition
of
a
healthy
and
life
and
will
seek
to
distribute
more
widely
the
property
rights
which
make
them
the
privilege
of
a
minority
but
they
will
refuse
to
submit
to
the
naÃ¯ve
philosophy
which
would
treat
all
proprietary
rights
as
equal
in
sanctity
merely
because
they
are
identical
in
name
they
will
distinguish
sharply
between
property
which
is
used
by
its
owner
for
the
conduct
of
his
profession
or
the
upkeep
of
his
household
and
property
which
is
merely
a
claim
on
wealth
produced
by
another
labor
they
will
insist
that
property
is
moral
and
healthy
only
when
it
is
used
as
a
condition
not
of
idleness
but
of
activity
and
when
it
involves
the
discharge
of
definite
personal
obligations
they
will
endeavor
in
short
to
base
it
upon
the
principle
of
function
vi
the
functional
society
the
application
to
property
and
industry
of
the
principle
of
function
is
compatible
with
several
different
types
of
social
organization
and
is
as
unlikely
as
more
important
revelations
to
be
the
secret
of
those
who
cry
lo
here
and
lo
there
the
essential
thing
is
that
men
should
fix
their
minds
upon
the
idea
of
purpose
and
give
that
idea
over
all
subsidiary
issues
if
as
is
patent
the
purpose
of
industry
is
to
provide
the
material
foundation
of
a
good
social
life
then
any
measure
which
makes
that
provision
more
effective
so
long
as
it
does
not
conflict
with
some
still
more
important
purpose
is
wise
and
any
institution
which
thwarts
or
encumbers
it
is
foolish
it
is
foolish
for
example
to
cripple
education
as
it
is
crippled
in
england
for
the
sake
of
industry
for
one
of
the
uses
of
industry
is
to
provide
the
wealth
which
may
make
possible
better
education
it
is
foolish
to
maintain
property
rights
for
which
no
service
is
performed
for
payment
without
service
is
waste
and
if
it
is
true
as
statisticians
affirm
that
even
were
income
equally
divided
income
per
head
would
be
small
then
it
is
all
the
more
foolish
for
sailors
in
a
boat
have
no
room
for
passengers
and
it
is
all
the
more
important
that
none
of
the
small
national
income
should
be
misapplied
it
is
foolish
to
leave
the
direction
of
industry
in
the
hands
of
servants
of
private
who
themselves
know
nothing
about
it
but
its
balance
sheets
because
this
is
to
divert
it
from
the
performance
of
service
to
the
acquisition
of
gain
and
to
subordinate
those
who
do
creative
work
to
those
who
do
not
the
course
of
wisdom
in
the
affairs
of
industry
is
after
all
what
it
is
in
any
other
department
of
organized
life
it
is
to
consider
the
end
for
which
economic
activity
is
carried
on
and
then
to
adapt
economic
organization
to
it
it
is
to
pay
for
service
and
for
service
only
and
when
capital
is
hired
to
make
sure
that
it
is
hired
at
the
cheapest
possible
price
it
is
to
place
the
responsibility
for
organizing
industry
on
the
shoulders
of
those
who
work
and
use
not
of
those
who
own
because
production
is
the
business
of
the
producer
and
the
proper
person
to
see
that
he
discharges
his
business
is
the
consumer
for
whom
and
not
for
the
owner
of
property
it
ought
to
be
carried
on
above
all
it
is
to
insist
that
all
industries
shall
be
conducted
in
complete
publicity
as
to
costs
and
profits
because
publicity
ought
to
be
the
antiseptic
both
of
economic
and
political
abuses
and
no
man
can
have
confidence
in
his
neighbor
unless
both
work
in
the
light
as
far
as
property
is
concerned
such
a
policy
would
possess
two
edges
on
the
one
hand
it
would
aim
at
abolishing
those
forms
of
property
in
which
ownership
is
divorced
from
obligations
on
the
other
hand
it
would
seek
to
encourage
those
forms
of
economic
organization
under
which
the
worker
whether
owner
or
not
is
free
to
carry
on
his
work
without
sharing
its
control
or
its
profits
with
the
mere
thus
if
in
certain
spheres
it
involved
an
extension
of
public
ownership
it
would
in
others
foster
an
extension
of
private
property
for
it
is
not
private
ownership
but
private
ownership
divorced
from
work
which
is
corrupting
to
the
principle
of
industry
and
the
idea
of
some
socialists
that
private
property
in
land
or
capital
is
necessarily
mischievous
is
a
piece
of
scholastic
pedantry
as
absurd
as
that
of
those
conservatives
who
would
invest
all
property
with
some
kind
of
mysterious
sanctity
it
all
depends
what
sort
of
property
it
is
and
for
what
purpose
it
is
used
provided
that
the
state
retains
its
eminent
domain
and
controls
alienation
as
it
does
under
the
homestead
laws
of
the
dominions
with
sufficient
stringency
to
prevent
the
creation
of
a
class
of
functionless
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
encouraging
simultaneously
a
multiplication
of
peasant
farmers
and
small
masters
who
own
their
own
farms
or
shops
and
the
abolition
of
private
ownership
in
those
industries
unfortunately
the
most
conspicuous
in
which
the
private
owner
is
an
absentee
shareholder
indeed
the
second
reform
would
help
the
first
in
so
far
as
the
community
tolerates
functionless
property
it
makes
difficult
if
not
impossible
the
restoration
of
the
small
master
in
agriculture
or
in
industry
who
can
not
easily
hold
his
own
in
a
world
dominated
by
great
estates
or
capitalist
finance
in
so
far
as
it
abolishes
those
kinds
of
property
which
are
merely
parasitic
it
facilitates
the
restoration
of
the
small
in
those
kinds
of
industry
for
which
small
ownership
is
adapted
a
socialistic
policy
towards
the
former
is
not
antagonistic
to
the
distributive
state
but
in
modern
economic
conditions
a
necessary
preliminary
to
it
and
if
by
property
is
meant
the
personal
possessions
which
the
word
suggests
to
of
the
population
the
object
of
socialists
is
not
to
undermine
property
but
to
protect
and
increase
it
the
boundary
between
large
scale
and
small
scale
production
will
always
be
uncertain
and
fluctuating
depending
as
it
does
on
technical
conditions
which
can
not
be
foreseen
a
cheapening
of
electrical
power
for
example
might
result
in
the
decentralization
of
manufactures
as
steam
resulted
in
their
concentration
the
fundamental
issue
however
is
not
between
different
scales
of
ownership
but
between
ownership
of
different
kinds
not
between
the
large
farmer
or
master
and
the
small
but
between
property
which
is
used
for
work
and
property
which
yields
income
without
it
the
irish
landlord
was
abolished
not
because
he
owned
a
large
scale
but
because
he
was
an
owner
and
nothing
more
if
and
when
english
has
been
equally
attenuated
as
in
towns
it
already
has
been
it
will
deserve
to
meet
the
same
fate
once
the
issue
of
the
character
of
ownership
has
been
settled
the
question
of
the
size
of
the
economic
unit
can
be
left
to
settle
itself
the
first
step
then
towards
the
organization
of
economic
life
for
the
performance
of
function
is
to
abolish
those
types
of
private
property
in
return
for
which
no
function
is
performed
the
man
who
lives
by
owning
without
working
is
necessarily
supported
by
the
industry
of
some
one
else
and
is
therefore
too
expensive
a
luxury
to
be
encouraged
though
he
deserves
to
be
treated
with
the
leniency
which
ought
to
be
and
usually
is
not
shown
to
those
who
have
been
brought
up
from
infancy
to
any
other
disreputable
trade
indulgence
to
individuals
must
not
condone
the
institution
of
which
both
they
and
their
neighbors
are
the
victims
judged
by
this
standard
certain
kinds
of
property
are
obviously
the
rights
in
virtue
of
which
the
owner
of
the
surface
is
entitled
to
levy
a
tax
called
a
royalty
on
every
ton
of
coal
which
the
miner
brings
to
the
surface
to
levy
another
tax
called
a
on
every
ton
of
coal
transported
under
the
surface
of
his
land
though
its
amenity
and
value
may
be
quite
unaffected
to
distort
if
he
pleases
the
development
of
a
whole
district
by
refusing
access
to
the
minerals
except
upon
his
own
terms
and
to
cause
some
to
million
tons
to
be
wasted
in
barriers
between
different
properties
while
he
in
the
meantime
contributes
to
a
chorus
of
lamentation
over
the
wickedness
of
the
miners
in
not
producing
more
tons
of
coal
for
the
public
and
incidentally
more
private
taxes
for
himself
all
this
adds
an
agreeable
touch
of
humor
to
the
drab
quality
of
our
industrial
civilization
for
which
mineral
owners
deserve
perhaps
some
recognition
though
not
the
odd
a
year
which
is
paid
to
each
of
the
four
leading
players
or
the
a
year
which
is
distributed
among
the
crowd
the
alchemy
by
which
a
gentleman
who
has
never
seen
a
coal
mine
distills
the
contents
of
that
place
of
gloom
into
elegant
chambers
in
london
and
a
place
in
the
country
is
not
the
monopoly
of
royalty
owners
a
similar
feat
of
prestidigitation
is
performed
by
the
owner
of
urban
in
rural
districts
some
landlords
perhaps
many
landlords
are
partners
in
the
hazardous
and
difficult
business
of
agriculture
and
though
they
may
often
exercise
a
power
which
is
socially
excessive
the
position
which
they
hold
and
the
income
which
they
receive
are
in
part
at
last
a
return
for
the
functions
which
they
perform
the
ownership
of
urban
land
has
been
refined
till
of
that
crude
ore
only
the
pure
gold
is
left
it
is
the
perfect
sinecure
for
the
only
function
it
involves
is
that
of
collecting
its
profits
and
in
an
age
when
the
struggle
of
liberalism
against
sinecures
was
still
sufficiently
recent
to
stir
some
chords
of
memory
the
last
and
greatest
of
liberal
thinkers
drew
the
obvious
deduction
the
reasons
which
form
the
justification
of
property
in
land
wrote
mill
in
are
valid
only
in
so
far
as
the
proprietor
of
land
is
its
improver
in
no
sound
theory
of
private
property
was
it
ever
contemplated
that
the
proprietor
of
land
should
be
merely
a
sinecurist
quartered
on
it
urban
and
royalties
are
in
fact
as
the
prime
minister
in
his
unregenerate
days
suggested
a
tax
which
some
persons
are
permitted
by
the
law
to
levy
upon
the
industry
of
others
they
differ
from
public
taxation
only
in
that
their
amount
increases
in
proportion
not
to
the
nation
need
of
revenue
but
to
its
need
of
the
coal
and
space
on
which
they
are
levied
that
their
growth
inures
to
private
gain
not
to
public
benefit
and
that
if
the
proceeds
are
wasted
on
frivolous
expenditure
no
one
has
any
right
to
complain
because
the
arrangement
by
which
lord
smith
spends
wealth
produced
by
brown
on
objects
which
do
no
good
to
either
is
part
of
the
system
which
under
the
name
of
private
property
brown
as
well
as
lord
smith
have
learned
to
regard
as
essential
to
the
higher
welfare
of
mankind
but
if
we
accept
the
principle
of
function
we
shall
ask
what
is
the
of
this
arrangement
and
for
what
end
the
inhabitants
of
for
example
london
pay
a
year
to
their
ground
landlords
and
if
we
find
that
it
is
for
no
purpose
and
no
end
but
that
these
things
are
like
the
horseshoes
and
nails
which
the
city
of
london
presents
to
the
crown
on
account
of
land
in
the
parish
of
clement
danes
then
we
shall
not
deal
harshly
with
a
quaint
historical
survival
but
neither
shall
we
allow
it
to
distract
us
from
the
business
of
the
present
as
though
there
had
been
history
but
there
were
not
history
any
longer
we
shall
close
these
channels
through
which
wealth
leaks
away
by
resuming
the
ownership
of
minerals
and
of
urban
land
as
some
communities
in
the
british
dominions
and
on
the
continent
of
europe
have
resumed
it
already
we
shall
secure
that
such
large
accumulations
as
remain
change
hands
at
least
once
in
every
generation
by
increasing
our
taxes
on
inheritance
till
what
passes
to
the
heir
is
little
more
than
personal
possessions
not
the
right
to
a
tribute
from
industry
which
though
qualified
by
is
what
the
son
of
a
rich
man
inherits
we
shall
treat
mineral
owners
and
in
short
as
plato
would
have
treated
the
poets
whom
in
their
ability
to
make
something
out
of
nothing
and
to
bewitch
mankind
with
words
they
a
little
resemble
and
crown
them
with
flowers
and
usher
them
politely
out
of
the
state
vii
industry
as
a
profession
rights
without
functions
are
like
the
shades
in
homer
which
drank
blood
but
scattered
trembling
at
the
voice
of
a
man
to
extinguish
royalties
and
urban
is
merely
to
explode
a
superstition
it
needs
as
little
and
as
much
resolution
as
to
put
one
hand
through
any
other
ghost
in
all
industries
except
the
diminishing
number
in
which
the
capitalist
is
himself
the
manager
property
in
capital
is
almost
equally
passive
almost
but
not
quite
for
though
the
majority
of
its
owners
do
not
themselves
exercise
any
positive
function
they
appoint
those
who
do
it
is
true
of
course
that
the
question
of
how
capital
is
to
be
owned
is
distinct
from
the
question
of
how
it
is
to
be
administered
and
that
the
former
can
be
settled
without
prejudice
to
the
latter
to
infer
because
shareholders
own
capital
which
is
indispensable
to
industry
that
therefore
industry
is
dependent
upon
the
maintenance
of
capital
in
the
hands
of
shareholders
to
write
with
some
economists
as
though
if
private
property
in
capital
were
further
attenuated
or
abolished
altogether
the
constructive
energy
of
the
managers
who
may
own
capital
or
may
not
but
rarely
in
the
more
important
industries
own
more
than
a
small
fraction
of
it
must
necessarily
be
impaired
is
to
be
guilty
of
a
robust
and
to
ignore
the
most
obvious
facts
of
contemporary
industry
the
less
the
mere
capitalist
talks
about
the
necessity
for
the
consumer
of
an
efficient
organization
of
industry
the
better
for
whatever
the
future
of
industry
may
be
an
efficient
organization
is
likely
to
have
no
room
for
but
though
shareholders
do
not
govern
they
reign
at
least
to
the
extent
of
saying
once
a
year
roy
le
if
their
rights
are
pared
down
or
extinguished
the
necessity
for
some
organ
to
exercise
them
will
still
remain
and
the
question
of
the
ownership
of
capital
has
this
much
in
common
with
the
question
of
industrial
organization
that
the
problem
of
the
constitution
under
which
industry
is
to
be
conducted
is
common
to
both
that
constitution
must
be
sought
by
considering
how
industry
can
be
organized
to
express
most
perfectly
the
principle
of
purpose
the
application
to
industry
of
the
principle
of
purpose
is
simple
however
difficult
it
may
be
to
give
effect
to
it
it
is
to
turn
it
into
a
profession
a
profession
may
be
defined
most
simply
as
a
trade
which
is
organized
incompletely
no
doubt
but
genuinely
for
the
performance
of
function
it
is
not
simply
a
collection
of
individuals
who
get
a
living
for
themselves
by
the
same
kind
of
work
nor
is
it
merely
a
group
which
is
organized
exclusively
for
the
economic
protection
of
its
members
though
that
is
normally
among
its
purposes
it
is
a
body
of
men
who
carry
on
their
work
in
accordance
with
rules
designed
to
enforce
certain
standards
both
for
the
better
protection
of
its
members
and
for
the
better
service
of
the
public
the
standards
which
it
maintains
may
be
high
or
low
all
professions
have
some
rules
which
protect
the
interests
of
the
community
and
others
which
are
an
imposition
on
it
its
essence
is
that
it
assumes
certain
responsibilities
for
the
competence
of
its
members
or
the
quality
of
its
wares
and
that
it
deliberately
prohibits
certain
kinds
of
conduct
on
the
ground
that
though
they
may
be
profitable
to
the
individual
they
are
calculated
to
bring
into
disrepute
the
organization
to
which
he
belongs
while
some
of
its
rules
are
trade
union
regulations
designed
primarily
to
prevent
the
economic
standards
of
the
profession
being
lowered
by
unscrupulous
competition
others
have
as
their
main
object
to
secure
that
no
member
of
the
profession
shall
have
any
but
a
purely
professional
interest
in
his
work
by
excluding
the
incentive
of
speculative
profit
the
conception
implied
in
the
words
unprofessional
conduct
is
therefore
the
exact
opposite
of
the
theory
and
practice
which
assume
that
the
service
of
the
public
is
best
secured
by
the
unrestricted
pursuit
on
the
part
of
rival
traders
of
their
pecuniary
within
such
limits
as
the
law
allows
it
is
significant
that
at
the
time
when
the
professional
classes
had
deified
free
competition
as
the
arbiter
of
commerce
and
industry
they
did
not
dream
of
applying
it
to
the
occupations
in
which
they
themselves
were
primarily
interested
but
maintained
and
indeed
elaborated
machinery
through
which
a
professional
conscience
might
find
expression
the
rules
themselves
may
sometimes
appear
to
the
layman
arbitrary
and
but
their
object
is
clear
it
is
to
impose
on
the
profession
itself
the
obligation
of
maintaining
the
quality
of
the
service
and
to
prevent
its
common
purpose
being
frustrated
through
the
undue
influence
of
the
motive
of
pecuniary
gain
upon
the
necessities
or
cupidity
of
the
individual
the
difference
between
industry
as
it
exists
and
a
profession
is
then
simple
and
unmistakable
the
essence
of
the
former
is
that
its
only
criterion
is
the
financial
return
which
it
offers
to
its
shareholders
the
essence
of
the
latter
is
that
though
men
enter
it
for
the
sake
of
livelihood
the
measure
of
their
success
is
the
service
which
they
perform
not
the
gains
which
they
amass
they
may
as
in
the
case
of
a
successful
doctor
grow
rich
but
the
meaning
of
their
profession
both
for
themselves
and
for
the
public
is
not
that
they
make
money
but
that
they
make
health
or
safety
or
knowledge
or
good
government
or
good
law
they
depend
on
it
for
their
income
but
they
do
not
consider
that
any
conduct
which
increases
their
income
is
on
that
account
good
and
while
a
who
retires
with
half
a
million
is
counted
to
have
achieved
success
whether
the
boots
which
he
made
were
of
leather
or
brown
paper
a
civil
servant
who
did
the
same
would
be
impeached
so
if
they
are
doctors
they
recognize
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
conduct
which
can
not
be
practised
however
large
the
fee
offered
for
them
because
they
are
unprofessional
if
scholars
and
teachers
that
it
is
wrong
to
make
money
by
deliberately
deceiving
the
public
as
is
done
by
makers
of
patent
medicines
however
much
the
public
may
clamor
to
be
deceived
if
judges
or
public
servants
that
they
must
not
increase
their
incomes
by
selling
justice
for
money
if
soldiers
that
the
service
comes
first
and
their
private
inclinations
even
the
reasonable
preference
of
life
to
death
second
every
country
has
its
traitors
every
army
its
deserters
and
every
profession
its
blacklegs
to
idealize
the
professional
spirit
would
be
very
absurd
it
has
its
sordid
side
and
if
it
is
to
be
fostered
in
industry
safeguards
will
be
needed
to
check
its
excesses
but
there
is
all
the
difference
between
maintaining
a
standard
which
is
occasionally
abandoned
and
affirming
as
the
central
truth
of
existence
that
there
is
no
standard
to
maintain
the
meaning
of
a
profession
is
that
it
makes
the
traitors
the
exception
not
as
they
are
in
industry
the
rule
it
makes
them
the
exception
by
upholding
as
the
criterion
of
success
the
end
for
which
the
profession
whatever
it
may
be
is
carried
on
and
subordinating
the
inclination
appetites
and
ambitions
of
individuals
to
the
rules
of
an
organization
which
has
as
its
object
to
promote
the
performance
of
function
there
is
no
sharp
line
between
the
professions
and
the
industries
a
hundred
years
ago
the
trade
of
teaching
which
is
on
the
whole
an
honorable
public
service
was
rather
a
vulgar
speculation
upon
public
credulity
if
squeers
was
a
caricature
the
oxford
of
gibbon
and
adam
smith
was
a
solid
reality
no
local
authority
could
have
performed
of
the
duties
which
are
carried
out
by
a
modern
municipal
corporation
every
day
because
there
was
no
body
of
public
servants
to
perform
them
and
such
as
there
were
took
bribes
it
is
conceivable
at
least
that
some
branches
of
medicine
might
have
developed
on
the
lines
of
industrial
capitalism
with
hospitals
as
factories
doctors
hired
at
competitive
wages
as
their
hands
large
dividends
paid
to
shareholders
by
catering
for
the
rich
and
the
poor
who
do
not
offer
a
profitable
market
supplied
with
an
inferior
service
or
with
no
service
at
all
the
idea
that
there
is
some
mysterious
difference
between
making
munitions
of
war
and
firing
them
between
building
schools
and
teaching
in
them
when
built
between
providing
food
and
providing
health
which
makes
it
at
once
inevitable
and
laudable
that
the
former
should
be
carried
on
with
a
single
eye
to
pecuniary
gain
while
the
latter
are
conducted
by
professional
men
who
expect
to
be
paid
for
service
but
who
neither
watch
for
windfalls
nor
raise
their
fees
merely
because
there
are
more
sick
to
be
cured
more
children
to
be
taught
or
more
enemies
to
be
resisted
is
an
illusion
only
less
astonishing
than
that
the
leaders
of
industry
should
welcome
the
insult
as
an
honor
and
wear
their
humiliation
as
a
kind
of
halo
the
work
of
making
boots
or
building
a
house
is
in
itself
no
more
degrading
than
that
of
curing
the
sick
or
teaching
the
ignorant
it
is
as
necessary
and
therefore
as
honorable
it
should
be
at
least
equally
bound
by
rules
which
have
as
their
object
to
maintain
the
standards
of
professional
service
it
should
be
at
least
equally
free
from
the
vulgar
subordination
of
moral
standards
to
financial
interests
if
industry
is
to
be
organized
as
a
profession
two
changes
are
requisite
one
negative
and
one
positive
the
first
is
that
it
should
cease
to
be
conducted
by
the
agents
of
for
the
advantage
of
and
should
be
carried
on
instead
for
the
service
of
the
public
the
second
is
that
subject
to
rigorous
public
supervision
the
responsibility
for
the
maintenance
of
the
service
should
rest
upon
the
shoulders
of
those
from
organizer
and
scientist
to
laborer
by
whom
in
effect
the
work
is
conducted
the
first
change
is
necessary
because
the
conduct
of
industry
for
the
public
advantage
is
impossible
as
long
as
the
ultimate
authority
over
its
management
is
vested
in
those
whose
only
connection
with
it
and
interest
in
it
is
the
pursuit
of
gain
as
industry
is
at
present
organized
its
profits
and
its
control
belong
by
law
to
that
element
in
it
which
has
least
to
do
with
its
success
under
the
organization
which
has
become
normal
in
all
the
more
important
industries
except
agriculture
it
is
managed
by
the
salaried
agents
of
those
by
whom
the
property
is
owned
it
is
successful
if
it
returns
large
sums
to
shareholders
and
unsuccessful
if
it
does
not
if
an
opportunity
presents
itself
to
increase
dividends
by
practices
which
deteriorate
the
service
or
degrade
the
workers
the
officials
who
administer
industry
act
strictly
within
their
duty
if
they
seize
it
for
they
are
the
servants
of
their
employers
and
their
obligation
to
their
employers
is
to
provide
dividends
not
to
provide
service
but
the
owners
of
the
property
are
functionless
not
in
the
sense
of
course
that
the
tools
of
which
they
are
proprietors
are
not
useful
but
in
the
sense
that
since
work
and
ownership
are
increasingly
separated
the
efficient
use
of
the
tools
is
not
dependent
on
the
maintenance
of
the
proprietary
rights
exercised
over
them
of
course
there
are
many
managing
directors
who
both
own
capital
and
administer
the
business
but
it
is
none
the
less
the
case
that
most
shareholders
in
most
large
industries
are
normally
shareholders
and
nothing
more
nor
is
their
economic
interest
identical
as
is
sometimes
assumed
with
that
of
the
general
public
a
society
is
rich
when
material
goods
including
capital
are
cheap
and
human
beings
dear
indeed
the
word
riches
has
no
other
meaning
the
interest
of
those
who
own
the
property
used
in
industry
though
not
of
course
of
the
managers
who
administer
industry
and
who
themselves
are
servants
and
often
very
servants
at
that
is
that
their
capital
should
be
dear
and
human
beings
cheap
hence
if
the
industry
is
such
as
to
yield
a
considerable
return
or
if
one
unit
in
the
industry
owing
to
some
special
advantage
produces
more
cheaply
than
its
neighbors
while
selling
at
the
same
price
or
if
a
revival
of
trade
raises
prices
or
if
supplies
are
controlled
by
one
of
the
combines
which
are
now
the
rule
in
many
of
the
more
important
industries
the
resulting
surplus
normally
passes
neither
to
the
managers
nor
to
the
other
employees
nor
to
the
public
but
to
the
shareholders
such
an
arrangement
is
preposterous
in
the
literal
sense
of
being
the
reverse
of
that
which
would
be
established
by
considerations
of
equity
and
common
sense
and
gives
rise
among
other
things
to
what
is
called
the
struggle
between
labor
and
capital
the
phrase
is
apposite
since
it
is
as
absurd
as
the
relations
of
which
it
is
intended
to
be
a
description
to
deplore
or
to
advocate
harmony
between
labor
and
capital
is
as
rational
as
to
lament
the
bitterness
between
carpenters
and
hammers
or
to
promote
a
mission
for
restoring
amity
between
mankind
and
its
boots
the
only
significance
of
these
is
that
their
repetition
tends
to
muffle
their
inanity
even
to
the
point
of
persuading
sensible
men
that
capital
employs
labor
much
as
our
pagan
ancestors
imagined
that
the
other
pieces
of
wood
and
iron
which
they
deified
in
their
day
sent
their
crops
and
won
their
battles
when
men
have
gone
so
far
as
to
talk
as
though
their
idols
have
come
to
life
it
is
time
that
some
one
broke
them
labor
consists
of
persons
capital
of
things
the
only
use
of
things
is
to
be
applied
to
the
service
of
persons
the
business
of
persons
is
to
see
that
they
are
there
to
use
and
that
no
more
than
need
be
is
paid
for
using
them
thus
the
application
to
industry
of
the
principle
of
function
involves
an
alteration
of
proprietary
rights
because
those
rights
do
not
contribute
as
they
now
are
to
the
end
which
industry
exists
to
serve
what
gives
unity
to
any
activity
what
alone
can
reconcile
the
conflicting
claims
of
the
different
groups
engaged
in
it
is
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
carried
on
if
men
have
no
common
goal
it
is
no
wonder
that
they
should
fall
out
by
the
way
nor
are
they
likely
to
be
reconciled
by
a
redistribution
of
their
provisions
if
they
are
not
content
both
to
be
servants
one
or
other
must
be
master
and
it
is
idle
to
suppose
that
mastership
can
be
held
in
a
state
of
suspense
between
the
two
there
can
be
a
division
of
functions
between
different
grades
of
workers
or
between
worker
and
consumer
and
each
can
have
in
his
own
sphere
the
authority
needed
to
enable
him
to
fill
it
but
there
can
not
be
a
division
of
functions
between
the
worker
and
the
owner
who
is
owner
and
nothing
else
for
what
function
does
such
an
owner
perform
the
provision
of
capital
then
pay
him
the
sum
needed
to
secure
the
use
of
his
capital
but
neither
pay
him
more
nor
admit
him
to
a
position
of
authority
over
production
for
which
merely
as
an
owner
he
is
not
qualified
for
this
reason
while
an
equilibrium
between
worker
and
manager
is
possible
because
both
are
workers
that
which
it
is
sought
to
establish
between
worker
and
owner
is
not
it
is
like
the
proposal
of
the
germans
to
negotiate
with
belgium
from
brussels
their
proposals
may
be
excellent
but
it
is
not
evident
why
they
are
where
they
are
or
how
since
they
do
not
contribute
to
production
they
come
to
be
putting
forward
proposals
at
all
as
long
as
they
are
in
territory
where
they
have
no
business
to
be
their
excellence
as
individuals
will
be
overlooked
in
annoyance
at
the
system
which
puts
them
where
they
are
it
is
fortunate
indeed
if
nothing
worse
than
this
happens
for
one
way
of
solving
the
problem
of
the
conflict
of
rights
in
industry
is
not
to
base
rights
on
functions
as
we
propose
but
to
base
them
on
force
it
is
to
in
some
veiled
and
decorous
form
the
institution
of
slavery
by
making
labor
compulsory
in
nearly
all
countries
a
concerted
refusal
to
work
has
been
made
at
one
time
or
another
a
criminal
offense
there
are
parts
of
the
world
in
which
european
capitalists
unchecked
by
any
public
opinion
or
authority
independent
of
themselves
are
free
to
impose
almost
what
terms
they
please
upon
workmen
of
ignorant
and
helpless
races
in
those
districts
of
america
where
capitalism
still
retains
its
primitive
lawlessness
the
same
result
appears
to
be
produced
upon
immigrant
workmen
by
the
threat
of
violence
in
such
circumstances
the
conflict
of
rights
which
finds
expression
in
industrial
warfare
does
not
arise
because
the
rights
of
one
party
have
been
extinguished
the
simplicity
of
the
remedy
is
so
attractive
that
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
governments
of
industrial
nations
should
coquet
from
time
to
time
with
the
policy
of
compulsory
arbitration
after
all
it
is
pleaded
it
is
only
analogous
to
the
action
of
a
supernational
authority
which
should
use
its
common
force
to
prevent
the
outbreak
of
war
in
reality
compulsory
arbitration
is
the
opposite
of
any
policy
which
such
an
authority
could
pursue
either
with
justice
or
with
hope
of
success
for
it
takes
for
granted
the
stability
of
existing
relationships
and
intervenes
to
adjust
incidental
disputes
upon
the
assumption
that
their
equity
is
recognized
and
their
permanence
desired
in
industry
however
the
equity
of
existing
relationships
is
precisely
the
point
at
issue
a
league
of
nations
which
adjusted
between
a
subject
race
and
its
oppressors
between
slavs
and
magyars
or
the
inhabitants
of
what
was
once
prussian
poland
and
the
prussian
government
on
the
assumption
that
the
subordination
of
slavs
to
magyars
and
poles
to
prussians
was
part
of
an
unchangeable
order
would
rightly
be
resisted
by
all
those
who
think
liberty
more
precious
than
peace
a
state
which
in
the
name
of
peace
should
make
the
concerted
cessation
of
work
a
legal
offense
would
be
guilty
of
a
similar
betrayal
of
freedom
it
would
be
solving
the
conflict
of
rights
between
those
who
own
and
those
who
work
by
abolishing
the
rights
of
those
who
work
so
here
again
unless
we
are
prepared
to
some
form
of
forced
labor
we
reach
an
impasse
but
it
is
an
impasse
only
in
so
long
as
we
regard
the
proprietary
rights
of
those
who
own
the
capital
used
in
industry
as
absolute
and
an
end
in
themselves
if
instead
of
assuming
that
all
property
merely
because
it
is
property
is
equally
sacred
we
ask
what
is
the
for
which
capital
is
used
what
is
its
we
shall
realize
that
it
is
not
an
end
but
a
means
to
an
end
and
that
its
function
is
to
serve
and
assist
as
the
economists
tell
us
the
labor
of
human
beings
not
the
function
of
human
beings
to
serve
those
who
happen
to
own
it
and
from
this
truth
two
consequences
follow
the
first
is
that
since
capital
is
a
thing
which
ought
to
be
used
to
help
industry
as
a
man
may
use
a
bicycle
to
get
more
quickly
to
his
work
it
ought
when
it
is
employed
to
be
employed
on
the
cheapest
terms
possible
the
second
is
that
those
who
own
it
should
no
more
control
production
than
a
man
who
lets
a
house
controls
the
meals
which
shall
be
cooked
in
the
kitchen
or
the
man
who
lets
a
boat
the
speed
at
which
the
rowers
shall
pull
in
other
words
capital
should
always
be
got
at
cost
price
which
means
unless
the
state
finds
it
wise
as
it
very
well
may
to
own
the
capital
used
in
certain
industries
it
should
be
paid
the
lowest
interest
for
which
it
can
be
obtained
but
should
carry
no
right
either
to
residuary
dividends
or
to
the
control
of
industry
there
are
in
theory
five
ways
by
which
the
control
of
industry
by
the
agents
of
private
can
be
terminated
they
may
be
expropriated
without
compensation
they
may
voluntarily
surrender
it
they
may
be
frozen
out
by
action
on
the
part
of
the
working
which
itself
undertakes
such
functions
if
any
as
they
have
performed
and
makes
them
superfluous
by
conducting
production
without
their
assistance
their
proprietary
interest
may
be
limited
or
attenuated
to
such
a
degree
that
they
become
mere
who
are
guaranteed
a
fixed
payment
analogous
to
that
of
the
but
who
receive
no
profits
and
bear
no
responsibility
for
the
organization
of
industry
they
may
be
bought
out
the
first
alternative
is
exemplified
by
the
historical
confiscations
of
the
past
such
as
for
instance
by
the
seizure
of
ecclesiastical
property
by
the
ruling
classes
of
england
scotland
and
most
other
protestant
states
the
second
has
rarely
if
ever
been
tried
the
nearest
approach
to
it
perhaps
was
the
famous
abdication
of
august
the
third
is
the
method
apparently
contemplated
by
the
building
guilds
which
are
now
in
process
of
formation
in
great
britain
the
fourth
method
of
treating
the
capitalist
is
followed
by
the
movement
it
is
also
that
proposed
by
the
committee
of
employers
and
in
the
building
industry
over
which
foster
presided
and
which
proposed
that
employers
should
be
paid
a
fixed
salary
and
a
fixed
rate
of
interest
on
their
capital
but
that
all
surplus
profits
should
be
pooled
and
administered
by
a
central
body
representing
employers
and
workers
the
fifth
has
repeatedly
been
practised
by
municipalities
and
somewhat
less
often
by
national
governments
which
of
these
alternative
methods
of
removing
industry
from
the
control
of
the
is
adopted
is
a
matter
of
expediency
to
be
decided
in
each
particular
case
nationalization
therefore
which
is
sometimes
advanced
as
the
only
method
of
extinguishing
proprietary
rights
is
merely
one
species
of
a
considerable
genus
it
can
be
used
of
course
to
produce
the
desired
result
but
there
are
some
industries
at
any
rate
in
which
nationalization
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
bring
it
about
and
since
it
is
at
best
a
cumbrous
process
when
other
methods
are
possible
other
methods
should
be
used
nationalization
is
a
means
to
an
end
not
an
end
in
itself
properly
conceived
its
object
is
not
to
establish
state
management
of
industry
but
to
remove
the
dead
hand
of
private
ownership
when
the
private
owner
has
ceased
to
perform
any
positive
function
it
is
unfortunate
therefore
that
the
abolition
of
obstructive
property
rights
which
is
indispensable
should
have
been
identified
with
a
single
formula
which
may
be
applied
with
advantage
in
the
special
circumstances
of
some
industries
but
need
not
necessarily
be
applied
in
all
ownership
is
not
a
right
but
a
bundle
of
rights
and
it
is
possible
to
strip
them
off
piecemeal
as
well
as
to
strike
them
off
simultaneously
the
ownership
of
capital
involves
as
we
have
said
three
main
claims
the
right
to
interest
as
the
price
of
capital
the
right
to
profits
and
the
right
to
control
in
virtue
of
which
managers
and
workmen
are
the
servants
of
shareholders
these
rights
in
their
fullest
degree
are
not
the
invariable
accompaniment
of
ownership
nor
need
they
necessarily
the
ingenuity
of
financiers
long
ago
devised
methods
of
grading
stock
in
such
a
way
that
the
ownership
of
some
carries
full
control
while
that
of
others
does
not
that
some
bear
all
the
risk
and
are
entitled
to
all
the
profits
while
others
are
limited
in
respect
to
both
all
are
property
but
not
all
carry
proprietary
rights
of
the
same
degree
as
long
as
the
private
ownership
of
industrial
capital
remains
the
object
of
reformers
should
be
to
attenuate
its
influence
by
insisting
that
it
shall
be
paid
not
more
than
a
rate
of
interest
fixed
in
advance
and
that
it
should
carry
with
it
no
right
of
control
in
such
circumstances
the
position
of
the
ordinary
shareholder
would
approximate
to
that
of
the
owner
of
debentures
the
property
in
the
industry
would
be
converted
into
a
mortgage
on
its
profits
while
the
control
of
its
administration
and
all
profits
in
excess
of
the
minimum
would
remain
to
be
vested
elsewhere
so
of
course
would
the
risks
but
risks
are
of
two
kinds
those
of
the
individual
business
and
those
of
the
industry
the
former
are
much
heavier
than
the
latter
for
though
a
coal
mine
is
a
speculative
investment
coal
mining
is
not
and
as
long
as
each
business
is
managed
as
a
separate
unit
the
payments
made
to
shareholders
must
cover
both
if
the
ownership
of
capital
in
each
industry
were
unified
which
does
not
mean
centralized
those
risks
which
are
incidental
to
individual
competition
would
be
eliminated
and
the
credit
of
each
unit
would
be
that
of
the
whole
such
a
change
in
the
character
of
ownership
would
have
three
advantages
it
would
abolish
the
government
of
industry
by
property
it
would
end
the
payment
of
profits
to
functionless
shareholders
by
turning
them
into
creditors
paid
a
fixed
rate
of
interest
it
would
lay
the
only
possible
foundations
for
industrial
peace
by
making
it
possible
to
convert
industry
into
a
profession
carried
on
by
all
grades
of
workers
for
the
service
of
the
public
not
for
the
gain
of
those
who
own
capital
the
organization
which
it
would
produce
will
be
described
of
course
as
impracticable
it
is
interesting
therefore
to
find
it
is
that
which
experience
has
led
practical
men
to
suggest
as
a
remedy
for
the
disorders
of
one
of
the
most
important
of
national
industries
that
of
building
the
question
before
the
committee
of
employers
and
workmen
which
issued
last
august
a
report
upon
the
building
trade
was
scientific
management
and
the
reduction
of
costs
these
are
not
phrases
which
suggest
an
economic
revolution
but
it
is
something
little
short
of
a
revolution
that
the
signatories
of
the
report
propose
for
as
soon
as
they
came
to
grips
with
the
problem
they
found
that
it
was
impossible
to
handle
it
effectively
without
reconstituting
the
general
fabric
of
industrial
relationships
which
is
its
setting
why
is
the
service
supplied
by
the
industry
ineffective
partly
because
the
workers
do
not
give
their
full
energies
to
the
performance
of
their
part
in
production
why
do
they
not
give
their
best
energies
because
of
the
fear
of
unemployment
the
disinclination
of
the
operatives
to
make
unlimited
profit
for
private
employers
the
lack
of
interest
evinced
by
operatives
owing
to
their
in
control
inefficiency
both
managerial
and
operative
how
are
these
psychological
obstacles
to
efficiency
to
be
counteracted
by
increased
supervision
and
speeding
up
by
the
allurements
of
a
premium
bonus
system
or
the
other
devices
by
which
men
who
are
too
ingenious
to
have
imagination
or
moral
insight
would
bully
or
cajole
poor
human
nature
into
doing
what
if
only
the
systems
they
invent
would
let
it
it
desires
to
do
simple
duties
and
honest
work
not
at
all
by
turning
the
building
of
houses
into
what
teaching
now
is
and
squeers
thought
it
could
never
be
an
honorable
profession
we
believe
they
write
that
the
great
task
of
our
industrial
council
is
to
develop
an
entirely
new
system
of
industrial
control
by
the
members
of
the
industry
itself
the
actual
producers
whether
by
hand
or
brain
and
to
bring
them
into
with
the
state
as
the
central
representative
of
the
community
whom
they
are
organized
to
serve
instead
of
unlimited
profits
so
indispensable
as
an
incentive
to
efficiency
the
employer
is
to
be
paid
a
salary
for
his
services
as
manager
and
a
rate
of
interest
on
his
capital
which
is
to
be
both
fixed
and
unless
he
fails
to
earn
it
through
his
own
inefficiency
guaranteed
anything
in
excess
of
it
any
profits
in
fact
which
in
other
industries
are
distributed
as
dividends
to
shareholders
he
is
to
surrender
to
a
central
fund
to
be
administered
by
employers
and
workmen
for
the
benefit
of
the
industry
as
a
whole
instead
of
the
financial
standing
of
each
firm
being
treated
as
an
inscrutable
mystery
to
the
public
with
the
result
that
it
is
sometimes
a
mystery
to
itself
there
is
to
be
a
system
of
public
costing
and
audit
on
the
basis
of
which
the
industry
will
assume
a
collective
liability
for
those
firms
which
are
shown
to
be
competently
managed
instead
of
the
workers
being
dismissed
in
slack
times
to
struggle
along
as
best
they
can
they
are
to
be
maintained
from
a
fund
raised
by
a
levy
on
employers
and
administered
by
the
trade
unions
there
is
to
be
publicity
as
to
costs
and
profits
open
dealing
and
honest
work
and
mutual
helpfulness
instead
of
the
competition
which
the
nineteenth
century
regarded
as
an
efficient
substitute
for
them
capital
is
not
to
employ
labor
labor
which
includes
managerial
labor
is
to
employ
capital
and
to
employ
it
at
the
cheapest
rate
at
which
in
the
circumstances
of
the
trade
it
can
be
got
if
it
employs
it
so
successfully
that
there
is
a
surplus
when
it
has
been
fairly
paid
for
its
own
services
then
that
surplus
is
not
to
be
divided
among
shareholders
for
when
they
have
been
paid
interest
they
have
been
paid
their
due
it
is
to
be
used
to
equip
the
industry
to
provide
still
more
effective
service
in
the
future
so
here
we
have
the
majority
of
a
body
of
practical
men
who
care
nothing
for
socialist
theories
proposing
to
establish
organized
public
service
in
the
building
industry
recommending
in
short
that
their
industry
shall
be
turned
into
a
profession
and
they
do
it
it
will
be
observed
by
just
that
functional
organization
just
that
conversion
of
full
proprietary
rights
into
a
mortgage
secured
as
far
as
efficient
firms
are
concerned
on
the
industry
as
a
whole
just
that
transference
of
the
control
of
production
from
the
owner
of
capital
to
those
whose
business
is
production
which
we
saw
is
necessary
if
industry
is
to
be
organized
for
the
performance
of
service
not
for
the
pecuniary
advantage
of
those
who
hold
proprietary
rights
their
report
is
of
the
first
importance
as
offering
a
policy
for
attenuating
private
property
in
capital
in
the
important
group
of
industries
in
which
private
ownership
in
one
form
or
another
is
likely
for
some
considerable
time
to
continue
and
a
valuable
service
would
be
rendered
by
any
one
who
would
work
out
in
detail
the
application
of
its
principle
to
other
trades
not
of
course
that
this
is
the
only
way
or
in
highly
capitalized
industries
the
most
feasible
way
in
which
the
change
can
be
brought
about
had
the
movement
against
the
control
of
production
by
property
taken
place
before
the
rise
of
limited
companies
in
which
ownership
is
separated
from
management
the
transition
to
the
organization
of
industry
as
a
profession
might
also
have
taken
place
as
the
employers
and
workmen
in
the
building
trade
propose
that
it
should
by
limiting
the
rights
of
private
ownership
without
abolishing
it
but
that
is
not
what
has
actually
happened
and
therefore
the
proposals
of
the
building
trade
are
not
of
universal
application
it
is
possible
to
retain
private
ownership
in
building
and
in
industries
like
building
while
changing
its
character
precisely
because
in
building
the
employer
is
normally
not
merely
an
owner
but
something
else
as
well
he
is
a
manager
that
is
he
is
a
workman
and
because
he
is
a
workman
whose
interests
and
still
more
whose
professional
spirit
as
a
workman
may
often
outweigh
his
interests
and
merely
financial
spirit
as
an
owner
he
can
form
part
of
the
productive
organization
of
the
industry
after
his
rights
as
an
owner
have
been
trimmed
and
limited
but
that
dual
position
is
abnormal
and
in
the
highly
organized
industries
is
becoming
more
abnormal
every
year
in
coal
in
cotton
in
in
many
branches
of
engineering
the
owner
of
capital
is
not
as
he
is
in
building
an
organizer
or
manager
his
connection
with
the
industry
and
interest
in
it
is
purely
financial
he
is
an
owner
and
nothing
more
and
because
his
interest
is
merely
financial
so
that
his
concern
is
dividends
and
production
only
as
a
means
to
dividends
he
can
not
be
worked
into
an
organization
of
industry
which
vests
administration
in
a
body
representing
all
grades
of
producers
or
producers
and
consumers
together
for
he
has
no
purpose
in
common
with
them
so
that
while
joint
councils
between
workers
and
managers
may
succeed
joint
councils
between
workers
and
owners
or
agents
of
owners
like
most
of
the
whitley
councils
will
not
because
the
necessity
for
the
mere
owner
is
itself
one
of
the
points
in
dispute
the
master
builder
who
owns
the
capital
used
can
be
included
not
capitalist
but
builder
if
he
surrenders
some
of
the
rights
of
ownership
as
the
building
industry
committee
proposed
that
he
should
but
if
the
shareholder
in
a
colliery
or
a
shipyard
abdicates
the
control
and
unlimited
profits
to
which
capitalist
he
is
at
present
entitled
he
abdicates
everything
that
makes
him
what
he
is
and
has
no
other
standing
in
the
industry
he
can
not
share
like
the
master
builder
in
its
management
because
he
has
no
qualifications
which
would
enable
him
to
do
so
his
object
is
profit
and
if
industry
is
to
become
as
employers
and
workers
in
the
building
trade
propose
an
organized
public
service
then
its
subordination
to
the
shareholder
whose
object
is
profit
is
as
they
clearly
see
precisely
what
must
be
eliminated
the
master
builders
propose
to
give
it
up
they
can
do
so
because
they
have
their
place
in
the
industry
in
virtue
of
their
function
as
workmen
but
if
the
shareholder
gave
it
up
he
would
have
no
place
at
all
hence
in
coal
mining
where
ownership
and
management
are
sharply
separated
the
owners
will
not
admit
the
bare
possibility
of
any
system
in
which
the
control
of
the
administration
of
the
mines
is
shared
between
the
management
and
the
miners
i
am
authorized
to
state
on
behalf
of
the
mining
association
lord
gainford
the
chief
witness
on
behalf
of
the
informed
the
coal
commission
that
if
the
owners
are
not
to
be
left
complete
executive
control
they
will
decline
to
accept
the
responsibility
for
carrying
on
the
industry
so
the
blow
away
in
a
sentence
the
whole
body
of
plausible
which
rests
on
the
idea
that
while
private
ownership
remains
unaltered
industrial
harmony
can
be
produced
by
the
magic
formula
of
joint
control
and
they
are
right
the
representatives
of
workmen
and
shareholders
in
mining
and
in
other
industries
can
meet
and
negotiate
and
discuss
but
joint
administration
of
the
shareholders
property
by
a
body
representing
shareholders
and
workmen
is
impossible
because
there
is
no
purpose
in
common
between
them
for
the
only
purpose
which
could
unite
all
persons
engaged
in
industry
and
overrule
their
particular
and
divergent
interests
is
the
provision
of
service
and
the
object
of
shareholders
the
whole
significance
and
of
industry
to
them
is
not
the
provision
of
service
but
the
provision
of
dividends
in
industries
where
management
is
divorced
from
ownership
as
in
most
of
the
highly
organized
trades
it
is
there
is
no
obvious
halfway
house
therefore
between
the
retention
of
the
present
system
and
the
complete
extrusion
of
the
capitalist
from
the
control
of
production
the
change
in
the
character
of
ownership
which
is
necessary
in
order
that
coal
or
textiles
and
may
be
organized
as
professions
for
the
service
of
the
public
can
not
easily
spring
from
within
the
stroke
needed
to
liberate
them
from
the
control
of
the
must
come
from
without
in
theory
it
might
be
struck
by
action
on
the
part
of
organized
workers
who
would
abolish
residuary
profits
and
the
right
of
control
by
the
mere
procedure
of
refusing
to
work
as
long
as
they
were
maintained
on
the
historical
analogy
offered
by
peasants
who
have
destroyed
predatory
property
in
the
past
by
declining
to
pay
its
dues
and
admit
its
government
in
which
case
parliament
would
intervene
only
to
register
the
community
assent
to
the
in
practice
however
the
conditions
of
modern
industry
being
what
they
are
that
course
apart
from
its
other
disadvantages
is
so
unlikely
to
be
attempted
or
if
attempted
to
succeed
that
it
can
be
neglected
the
alternative
to
it
is
that
the
change
in
the
character
of
property
should
be
affected
by
legislation
in
virtue
of
which
the
rights
of
ownership
in
an
industry
are
bought
out
simultaneously
in
either
case
though
the
procedure
is
different
the
result
of
the
change
once
it
is
accomplished
is
the
same
private
property
in
capital
in
the
sense
of
the
right
to
profits
and
control
is
abolished
what
remains
of
it
is
at
most
a
mortgage
in
favor
of
the
previous
proprietors
a
dead
leaf
which
is
preserved
though
the
sap
of
industry
no
longer
feeds
it
as
long
as
it
is
not
thought
worth
while
to
strike
it
off
and
since
the
capital
needed
to
maintain
and
equip
a
modern
industry
could
not
be
provided
by
any
one
group
of
workers
even
were
it
desirable
on
other
grounds
that
they
should
step
completely
into
the
position
of
the
present
owners
the
complex
of
rights
which
constitutes
ownership
remains
to
be
shared
between
them
and
whatever
organ
may
act
on
behalf
of
the
general
community
the
former
for
example
may
be
the
heir
of
the
present
owners
as
far
as
the
control
of
the
routine
and
administration
of
industry
is
concerned
the
latter
may
succeed
to
their
right
to
dispose
of
residuary
profits
the
elements
composing
property
have
in
fact
to
be
disentangled
and
the
fact
that
under
the
common
name
of
ownership
several
different
powers
are
vested
in
identical
hands
must
not
be
allowed
to
obscure
the
probability
that
once
private
property
in
capital
has
been
abolished
it
may
be
expedient
to
those
powers
in
detail
as
well
as
to
transfer
them
the
essence
of
a
profession
is
as
we
have
suggested
that
its
members
organize
themselves
for
the
performance
of
function
it
is
essential
therefore
if
industry
is
to
be
professionalized
that
the
abolition
of
functionless
property
should
not
be
interpreted
to
imply
a
continuance
under
public
ownership
of
the
absence
of
responsibility
on
the
part
of
the
of
industry
which
is
the
normal
accompaniment
of
private
ownership
working
through
the
it
is
the
more
important
to
emphasize
that
point
because
such
an
implication
has
sometimes
been
conveyed
in
the
past
by
some
of
those
who
have
presented
the
case
for
some
such
change
in
the
character
of
ownership
as
has
been
urged
above
the
name
consecrated
by
custom
to
the
transformation
of
property
by
public
and
external
action
is
nationalization
but
nationalization
is
a
word
which
is
neither
very
felicitous
nor
free
from
ambiguity
properly
used
it
means
merely
ownership
by
a
body
representing
the
nation
but
it
has
come
in
practice
to
be
used
as
equivalent
to
a
particular
method
of
administration
under
which
officials
employed
by
the
state
step
into
the
position
of
the
present
directors
of
industry
and
exercise
all
the
power
which
they
exercised
so
those
who
desire
to
maintain
the
system
under
which
industry
is
carried
on
not
as
a
profession
serving
the
public
but
for
the
advantage
of
shareholders
attack
nationalization
on
the
ground
that
state
management
is
necessarily
inefficient
and
tremble
with
apprehension
whenever
they
post
a
letter
in
a
and
those
who
desire
to
change
it
reply
that
state
services
are
efficient
and
praise
god
whenever
they
use
a
telephone
as
though
either
private
or
public
administration
had
certain
peculiar
and
unalterable
characteristics
instead
of
depending
for
its
quality
like
an
army
or
railway
company
or
school
and
all
other
undertakings
public
and
private
alike
not
on
whether
those
who
conduct
it
are
private
officials
or
state
officials
but
on
whether
they
are
properly
trained
for
their
work
and
can
command
the
good
will
and
confidence
of
their
subordinates
the
arguments
on
both
sides
are
ingenious
but
in
reality
nearly
all
of
them
are
beside
the
point
the
merits
of
nationalization
do
not
stand
or
fall
with
the
efficiency
or
inefficiency
of
existing
state
departments
as
administrators
of
industry
for
nationalization
which
means
public
ownership
is
compatible
with
several
different
types
of
management
the
constitution
of
the
industry
may
be
unitary
as
is
for
example
that
of
the
or
it
may
be
federal
as
was
that
designed
by
justice
sankey
for
the
coal
industry
administration
may
be
centralized
or
decentralized
the
authorities
to
whom
it
is
intrusted
may
be
composed
of
representatives
of
the
consumers
or
of
representatives
of
professional
associations
or
of
state
officials
or
of
all
three
in
several
different
proportions
executive
work
may
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
civil
servants
trained
recruited
and
promoted
as
in
the
existing
state
departments
or
a
new
service
may
be
created
with
a
procedure
and
standards
of
its
own
it
may
be
subject
to
treasury
control
or
it
may
be
financially
autonomous
the
problem
is
in
fact
of
a
familiar
though
difficult
order
it
is
one
of
it
is
commonly
assumed
by
controversialists
that
the
organization
and
management
of
a
nationalized
industry
must
for
some
undefined
reason
be
similar
to
that
of
the
one
might
as
reasonably
suggest
that
the
pattern
exemplar
of
private
enterprise
must
be
the
steel
corporation
or
the
imperial
tobacco
company
the
administrative
systems
obtaining
in
a
society
which
has
nationalized
its
foundation
industries
will
in
fact
be
as
various
as
in
one
that
resigns
them
to
private
ownership
and
to
discuss
their
relative
advantages
without
defining
what
particular
type
of
each
is
the
subject
of
reference
is
as
unhelpful
as
to
approach
a
modern
political
problem
in
terms
of
the
aristotelian
classification
of
constitutions
the
highly
abstract
dialectics
as
to
enterprise
initiative
bureaucracy
red
tape
democratic
control
state
management
which
fill
the
press
of
countries
occupied
with
industrial
problems
really
belong
to
the
dark
ages
of
economic
thought
the
first
task
of
the
student
whatever
his
personal
conclusions
is
it
may
be
suggested
to
contribute
what
he
can
to
the
restoration
of
sanity
by
insisting
that
instead
of
the
argument
being
conducted
with
the
counters
of
a
highly
inflated
and
rapidly
depreciating
verbal
currency
the
exact
situation
in
so
far
as
is
possible
shall
be
stated
as
it
is
uncertainties
of
which
there
are
many
shall
be
treated
as
uncertain
and
the
precise
meaning
of
alternative
proposals
shall
be
strictly
defined
not
the
least
of
the
merits
of
justice
sankey
report
was
that
by
stating
in
great
detail
the
type
of
organization
which
he
recommended
for
the
coal
industry
he
imparted
a
new
precision
and
reality
into
the
whole
discussion
whether
his
conclusions
are
accepted
or
not
it
is
from
the
basis
of
clearly
defined
proposals
such
as
his
that
the
future
discussion
of
these
problems
must
proceed
it
may
not
find
a
solution
it
will
at
least
do
something
to
create
the
temper
in
which
alone
a
reasonable
solution
can
be
sought
nationalization
then
is
not
an
end
but
a
means
to
an
end
and
when
the
question
of
ownership
has
been
settled
the
question
of
administration
remains
for
solution
as
a
means
it
is
likely
to
be
indispensable
in
those
industries
in
which
the
rights
of
private
proprietors
can
not
easily
be
modified
without
the
action
of
the
state
just
as
the
purchase
of
land
by
county
councils
is
a
necessary
step
to
the
establishment
of
small
holders
when
landowners
will
not
voluntarily
part
with
their
property
for
the
purpose
but
the
object
in
purchasing
land
is
to
establish
small
holders
not
to
set
up
farms
administered
by
state
officials
and
the
object
of
nationalizing
mining
or
railways
or
the
manufacture
of
steel
should
not
be
to
establish
any
particular
form
of
state
management
but
to
release
those
who
do
constructive
work
from
the
control
of
those
whose
sole
interest
is
pecuniary
gain
in
order
that
they
may
be
free
to
apply
their
energies
to
the
true
purpose
of
industry
which
is
the
provision
of
service
not
the
provision
of
dividends
when
the
transference
of
property
has
taken
place
it
will
probably
be
found
that
the
necessary
provision
for
the
government
of
industry
will
involve
not
merely
the
freedom
of
the
producers
to
produce
but
the
creation
of
machinery
through
which
the
consumer
for
whom
he
produces
can
express
his
wishes
and
criticize
the
way
in
which
they
are
met
as
at
present
he
normally
can
not
but
that
is
the
second
stage
in
the
process
of
reorganizing
industry
for
the
performance
of
function
not
the
first
the
first
is
to
free
it
from
subordination
to
the
pecuniary
interests
of
the
owner
of
property
because
they
are
the
magnetic
pole
which
sets
all
the
compasses
wrong
and
which
causes
industry
however
swiftly
it
may
progress
to
progress
in
the
wrong
direction
nor
does
this
change
in
the
character
of
property
involve
a
breach
with
the
existing
order
so
sharp
as
to
be
impracticable
the
phraseology
of
political
controversy
continues
to
reproduce
the
conventional
antitheses
of
the
early
nineteenth
century
private
enterprise
and
public
ownership
are
still
contrasted
with
each
other
as
light
with
darkness
or
darkness
with
light
but
in
reality
behind
the
formal
shell
of
the
traditional
legal
system
the
elements
of
a
new
body
of
relationship
have
already
been
prepared
and
find
application
through
policies
devised
not
by
socialists
but
by
men
who
repeat
the
formulÃ¦
of
individualism
at
the
very
moment
when
they
are
undermining
it
the
act
in
america
the
act
establishing
a
ministry
of
transport
in
england
sir
arthur
scheme
for
the
organization
of
the
coal
mines
the
proposals
with
regard
to
the
coal
industry
of
the
british
government
itself
appear
to
have
the
common
characteristic
of
retaining
private
ownership
in
name
while
attenuating
it
in
fact
by
placing
its
operators
under
the
supervision
accompanied
sometimes
by
a
financial
guarantee
of
a
public
authority
schemes
of
this
general
character
appear
indeed
to
be
the
first
instinctive
reaction
produced
by
the
discovery
that
private
enterprise
is
no
longer
functioning
effectively
it
is
probable
that
they
possess
certain
merits
of
a
technical
order
analogous
to
those
associated
with
the
amalgamation
of
competing
firms
into
a
single
combination
it
is
questionable
however
whether
the
compromise
which
they
represent
is
permanently
tenable
what
after
all
it
may
be
asked
are
the
advantages
of
private
ownership
when
it
has
been
pared
down
to
the
point
which
policies
of
this
order
propose
may
not
the
owner
whose
rights
they
are
designed
to
protect
not
unreasonably
reply
to
their
authors
thank
you
for
nothing
individual
enterprise
has
its
merits
so
also
perhaps
has
public
ownership
but
by
the
time
these
schemes
have
done
with
it
not
much
remains
of
the
simple
and
obvious
system
of
natural
liberty
while
their
inventors
are
precluded
from
appealing
to
the
motives
which
are
emphasized
by
advocates
of
nationalization
it
is
one
thing
to
be
an
entrepreneur
with
a
world
of
adventure
and
unlimited
profits
if
they
can
be
achieved
before
one
it
is
quite
another
to
be
a
director
of
a
railway
company
or
coal
corporation
with
a
minimum
rate
of
profit
guaranteed
by
the
state
and
a
maximum
rate
of
profit
which
can
not
be
exceeded
hybrids
are
apt
to
be
sterile
it
may
be
questioned
whether
in
drawing
the
teeth
of
private
capitalism
this
type
of
compromise
does
not
draw
out
most
of
its
virtues
as
well
so
when
a
certain
stage
of
economic
development
has
been
reached
private
ownership
by
the
admission
of
its
defenders
can
no
longer
be
tolerated
in
the
only
form
in
which
it
is
free
to
display
the
characteristic
and
quite
genuine
advantages
for
the
sake
of
which
it
used
to
be
defended
and
as
step
by
step
it
is
whittled
down
by
tacit
concessions
to
the
practical
necessity
of
protecting
the
consumer
or
eliminating
waste
or
meeting
the
claims
of
the
workers
public
ownership
becomes
not
only
on
social
grounds
but
for
reasons
of
economic
efficiency
the
alternative
to
a
type
of
private
ownership
which
appears
to
carry
with
it
few
rights
of
ownership
and
to
be
singularly
devoid
of
privacy
inevitably
and
unfortunately
the
change
must
be
gradual
but
it
should
be
continuous
when
as
in
the
last
few
years
the
state
has
acquired
the
ownership
of
great
masses
of
industrial
capital
it
should
retain
it
instead
of
surrendering
it
to
private
capitalists
who
protest
at
once
that
it
will
be
managed
so
inefficiently
that
it
will
not
pay
and
managed
so
efficiently
that
it
will
undersell
them
when
estates
are
being
broken
up
and
sold
as
they
are
at
present
public
bodies
should
enter
the
market
and
acquire
them
most
important
of
all
the
ridiculous
barrier
inherited
from
an
age
in
which
municipal
corporations
were
corrupt
oligarchies
which
at
present
prevents
england
local
authorities
from
acquiring
property
in
land
and
industrial
capital
except
for
purposes
specified
by
act
of
parliament
should
be
abolished
and
they
should
be
free
to
undertake
such
services
as
the
citizens
may
desire
the
objection
to
public
ownership
in
so
far
as
it
is
intelligent
is
in
reality
largely
an
objection
to
but
the
remedy
for
is
not
the
maintenance
of
functionless
property
in
private
hands
but
the
decentralized
ownership
of
public
property
and
when
birmingham
and
manchester
and
leeds
are
the
little
republics
which
they
should
be
there
is
no
reason
to
anticipate
that
they
will
tremble
at
a
whisper
from
whitehall
these
things
should
be
done
steadily
and
continuously
quite
apart
from
the
special
cases
like
that
of
the
mines
and
railways
where
the
private
ownership
of
capital
is
stated
by
the
experts
to
have
been
responsible
for
intolerable
waste
or
the
manufacture
of
ornaments
transcriber
note
armaments
and
alcoholic
liquor
which
are
politically
and
socially
too
dangerous
to
be
left
in
private
hands
they
should
be
done
not
in
order
to
establish
a
single
form
of
bureaucratic
management
but
in
order
to
release
the
industry
from
the
domination
of
proprietary
interests
which
whatever
the
form
of
management
are
not
merely
troublesome
in
detail
but
vicious
in
principle
because
they
divert
it
from
the
performance
of
function
to
the
acquisition
of
gain
if
at
the
same
time
private
ownership
is
shaken
as
recently
it
has
been
by
action
on
the
part
of
particular
groups
of
workers
so
much
the
better
there
are
more
ways
of
killing
a
cat
than
drowning
it
in
cream
and
it
is
all
the
more
likely
to
choose
the
cream
if
they
are
explained
to
it
but
the
two
methods
are
complementary
not
alternative
and
the
attempt
to
found
rival
schools
on
an
imaginary
incompatibility
between
them
is
a
bad
case
of
the
which
afflicts

indeed
it

even
less
justification
than

and
one
motive
for
secrecy
is
to
prevent
it
those
who
conduct
industry
at
the
present
time
and
who
are
most
emphatic
that
as
the
duke
of

of
the
unreformed
house
of
commons
they
have
never
read

of
any

up

which
can
in
any
degree
satisfy
the
mind
that
the
method
of
conducting
it
can
in
any
way
be
improved
are
also
those
apparently
who
with
some
honorable
exceptions
are
most
reluctant
that
the
full
facts
about
it
should
be
known
and
it
is
crucial
that
they
should
be
known
it
is
crucial
not
only
because
in
the
present
ignorance
of
the
real
economic
situation
all
industrial
disagreements
tend
inevitably
to
be
battles
in
the
dark
in
which
ignorant
armies
clash
by
night
but
because
unless
there
is
complete
publicity
as
to
profits
and
costs
it
is
impossible
to
form
any
judgment
either
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
prices
which
are
charged
or
of
the
claims
to
remuneration
of
the

parties

no

first
and
no
light
at
all
upon
the
second
and
so
when
the
facts
come
out
the
public
is
aghast
at
revelations
which
show
that
industry
is
conducted
with
bewildering
financial
extravagance
if
the
full
facts
had
been
published
as
they
should
have
been

these
revelations
would
probably
not

have
been
an
antiseptic
and
there
would
have
been

over
while
the
profits
of
distributors
in
london
alone
amount
in
the
aggregate
to
over
and
the
movement
which
aims
not
at
profit
but
at
service
distributes
household
coal
at
a
cost
of
from
to
less
per
ton
than
is
charged
by
the
coal
trade
but
these
are
exceptions
they
may
be
it
is
possible
that
in
the
industries
in
which
as
the
recent
committee
on
trusts
has
told
us
powerful
combinations
or
consolidations
of
one
kind
or
another
are
in
a
position
effectively
to
control
output
and
prices
not
only
costs
are
cut
to
the
bare
minimum
but
profits
are
inconsiderable
but
then
why
insist
on
this
humiliating
tradition
of
secrecy
with
regard
to
them
when
every
one
who
uses
their
products
and
every
one
who
renders
honest
service
to
production
stands
to
gain
by
publicity
if
industry
is
to
become
a
profession
whatever
its
management
the
first
of
its
professional
rules
should
be
as
sir
john
mann
told
the
coal
commission
that
all
cards
should
be
placed
on
the
table
if
it
were
the
duty
of
a
public
department
to
publish
quarterly
exact
returns
as
to
costs
of
production
and
profits
in
all
the
firms
throughout
an
industry
the
gain
in
mere
productive
efficiency
which
should
appeal
to
our
enthusiasts
for
output
would
be
considerable
for
the
organization
whose
costs
were
least
would
become
the
standard
with
which
all
other
types
of
organization
would
be
compared
the
gain
in
which
is
also
absurd
though
it
may
seem
a
condition
of
efficiency
would
be
incalculable
for
industry
would
be
conducted
in
the
light
of
day
its
costs
necessary
or
unnecessary
the
distribution
of
the
return
to
it
reasonable
or
capricious
would
be
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
it
would
be
held
to
its
purpose
by
the
mere
impossibility
of
persuading
those
who
make
its
products
or
those
who
consume
them
to
acquiesce
as
they
acquiesce
now
in
expenditure
which
is
meaningless
because
it
has
contributed
nothing
to
the
service
which
the
industry
exists
to
perform
the
organization
of
industry
as
a
profession
does
not
involve
only
the
abolition
of
functionless
property
and
the
maintenance
of
publicity
as
the
indispensable
condition
of
a
standard
of
professional
honor
it
implies
also
that
those
who
perform
its
work
should
undertake
that
its
work
is
performed
effectively
it
means
that
they
should
not
merely
be
held
to
the
service
of
the
public
by
fear
of
personal
inconvenience
or
penalties
but
that
they
should
treat
the
discharge
of
professional
responsibilities
as
an
obligation
attaching
not
only
to
a
small
of
intellectuals
managers
or
bosses
who
perform
the
technical
work
of
business
management
but
as
implied
by
the
mere
entry
into
the
industry
and
as
resting
on
the
corporate
consent
and
initiative
of
the
rank
and
file
of
workers
it
is
precisely
indeed
in
the
degree
to
which
that
obligation
is
interpreted
as
attaching
to
all
workers
and
not
merely
to
a
select
class
that
the
difference
between
the
existing
industrial
order
collectivism
and
the
organization
of
industry
as
a
profession
resides
the
first
involves
the
utilization
of
human
beings
for
the
purpose
of
private
gain
the
second
their
utilization
for
the
purpose
of
public
service
the
third
the
association
in
the
service
of
the
public
of
their
professional
pride
solidarity
and
organization
the
difference
in
administrative
machinery
between
the
second
and
third
might
not
be
considerable
both
involve
the
drastic
limitation
or
transference
to
the
public
of
the
proprietary
rights
of
the
existing
owners
of
industrial
capital
both
would
necessitate
machinery
for
bringing
the
opinion
of
the
consumers
to
bear
upon
the
service
supplied
them
by
the
industry
the
difference
consists
in
the
manner
in
which
the
obligations
of
the
producer
to
the
public
are
conceived
he
may
either
be
the
executant
of
orders
transmitted
to
him
by
its
agents
or
he
may
through
his
organization
himself
take
a
positive
part
in
determining
what
those
orders
should
be
in
the
former
case
he
is
responsible
for
his
own
work
but
not
for
anything
else
if
he
hews
his
stint
of
coal
it
is
no
business
of
his
whether
the
pit
is
a
failure
if
he
puts
in
the
normal
number
of
rivets
he
disclaims
all
further
interest
in
the
price
or
the
of
the
ship
in
the
latter
his
function
embraces
something
more
than
the
performance
of
the
specialized
piece
of
work
allotted
to
him
it
includes
also
a
responsibility
for
the
success
of
the
undertaking
as
a
whole
and
since
responsibility
is
impossible
without
power
his
position
would
involve
at
least
so
much
power
as
is
needed
to
secure
that
he
can
affect
in
practice
the
conduct
of
the
industry
it
is
this
collective
liability
for
the
maintenance
of
a
certain
quality
of
service
which
is
indeed
the
distinguishing
feature
of
a
profession
it
is
compatible
with
several
different
kinds
of
government
or
indeed
when
the
unit
of
production
is
not
a
group
but
an
individual
with
hardly
any
government
at
all
what
it
does
involve
is
that
the
individual
merely
by
entering
the
profession
should
have
committed
himself
to
certain
obligations
in
respect
of
its
conduct
and
that
the
professional
organization
whatever
it
may
be
should
have
sufficient
power
to
enable
it
to
maintain
them
the
demand
for
the
participation
of
the
workers
in
the
control
of
industry
is
usually
advanced
in
the
name
of
the
producer
as
a
plea
for
economic
freedom
or
industrial
democracy
political
freedom
writes
the
final
report
of
the
united
states
commission
of
industrial
relations
which
was
presented
in
can
exist
only
where
there
is
industrial
freedom
there
are
now
within
the
body
of
our
republic
industrial
communities
which
are
virtually
principalities
oppressive
to
those
dependent
upon
them
for
a
livelihood
and
a
dreadful
menace
to
the
peace
and
welfare
of
the
nation
the
vanity
of
englishmen
may
soften
the
shadows
and
heighten
the
lights
but
the
concentration
of
authority
is
too
deeply
rooted
in
the
very
essence
of
capitalism
for
differences
in
the
degree
of
the
arbitrariness
with
which
it
is
exercised
to
be
other
than
trivial
the
control
of
a
large
works
does
in
fact
confer
a
kind
of
private
jurisdiction
in
matters
concerning
the
life
and
livelihood
of
the
workers
which
as
the
united
states
commission
suggests
may
properly
be
described
as
industrial
feudalism
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
how
the
traditional
liberties
of
englishmen
are
compatible
with
an
organization
of
industry
which
except
in
so
far
as
it
has
been
qualified
by
law
or
trade
unionism
permits
populations
almost
as
large
as
those
of
some
famous
cities
of
the
past
to
be
controlled
in
their
rising
up
and
lying
down
in
their
work
economic
opportunities
and
social
life
by
the
decisions
of
a
committee
of
directors
the
most
conservative
thinkers
recognize
that
the
present
organization
of
industry
is
intolerable
in
the
sacrifice
of
liberty
which
it
entails
upon
the
producer
but
each
effort
which
he
makes
to
emancipate
himself
is
met
by
a
protest
that
if
the
existing
system
is
incompatible
with
freedom
it
at
least
secures
efficient
service
and
that
efficient
service
is
threatened
by
movements
which
aim
at
placing
a
greater
measure
of
industrial
control
in
the
hands
of
the
workers
the
attempt
to
drive
a
wedge
between
the
producer
and
the
consumer
is
obviously
the
cue
of
all
the
interests
which
are
conscious
that
by
themselves
they
are
unable
to
hold
back
the
flood
it
is
natural
therefore
that
during
the
last
few
months
they
should
have
concentrated
their
efforts
upon
representing
that
every
advance
in
the
demands
and
in
the
power
of
any
particular
group
of
workers
is
a
new
imposition
upon
the
general
body
of
the
public
eminent
persons
who
are
not
obviously
producing
more
than
they
consume
explain
to
the
working
classes
that
unless
they
produce
more
they
must
consume
less
highly
syndicated
combinations
warn
the
public
against
the
menace
of
predatory
syndicalism
the
owners
of
mines
and
minerals
in
their
new
role
as
protectors
of
the
poor
lament
the
selfishness
of
the
miners
as
though
nothing
but
pure
philanthropy
had
hitherto
caused
profits
and
royalties
to
be
reluctantly
accepted
by
themselves
the
assumption
upon
which
this
body
of
argument
rests
is
simple
it
is
that
the
existing
organization
of
industry
is
the
safeguard
of
productive
efficiency
and
that
from
every
attempt
to
alter
it
the
workers
themselves
lose
more
as
consumers
than
they
can
gain
as
producers
the
world
has
been
drained
of
its
wealth
and
demands
abundance
of
goods
the
workers
demand
a
larger
income
greater
leisure
and
a
more
secure
and
dignified
status
these
two
demands
it
is
argued
are
contradictory
for
how
can
the
consumer
be
supplied
with
cheap
goods
if
as
a
worker
he
insists
on
higher
wages
and
shorter
hours
and
how
can
the
worker
secure
these
conditions
if
as
a
consumer
he
demands
cheap
goods
so
industry
it
is
thought
moves
in
a
vicious
circle
of
shorter
hours
and
higher
wages
and
less
production
which
in
time
must
mean
longer
hours
and
lower
wages
and
every
one
receives
less
because
every
one
demands
more
the
picture
is
plausible
but
it
is
fallacious
it
is
fallacious
not
merely
in
its
crude
assumption
that
a
rise
in
wages
necessarily
involves
an
increase
in
costs
but
for
another
and
more
fundamental
reason
in
reality
the
cause
of
economic
confusion
is
not
that
the
demands
of
producer
and
consumer
meet
in
blunt
opposition
for
if
they
did
their
incompatibility
when
they
were
incompatible
would
be
obvious
and
neither
could
deny
his
responsibility
to
the
other
however
much
he
might
seek
to
evade
it
it
is
that
they
do
not
but
that
as
industry
is
organized
what
the
worker
foregoes
the
general
body
of
consumers
does
not
necessarily
gain
and
what
the
consumer
pays
the
general
body
of
workers
does
not
necessarily
receive
if
the
circle
is
vicious
its
vice
is
not
that
it
is
closed
but
that
it
is
always
half
open
so
that
part
of
production
leaks
away
in
consumption
which
adds
nothing
to
productive
energies
and
that
the
producer
because
he
knows
this
does
not
fully
use
even
the
productive
energy
which
he
commands
it
is
the
consciousness
of
this
leak
which
sets
every
one
at
cross
purposes
no
conceivable
system
of
industrial
organization
can
secure
industrial
peace
if
by
peace
is
meant
a
complete
absence
of
disagreement
what
could
be
secured
would
be
that
disagreements
should
not
flare
up
into
a
beacon
of
class
warfare
if
every
member
of
a
group
puts
something
into
a
common
pool
on
condition
of
taking
something
out
they
may
still
quarrel
about
the
size
of
the
shares
as
children
quarrel
over
cake
but
if
the
total
is
known
and
the
claims
admitted
that
is
all
they
can
quarrel
about
and
since
they
all
stand
on
the
same
footing
any
one
who
holds
out
for
more
than
his
fellows
must
show
some
good
reason
why
he
should
get
it
but
in
industry
the
claims
are
not
all
admitted
for
those
who
put
nothing
in
demand
to
take
something
out
both
the
total
to
be
divided
and
the
proportion
in
which
the
division
takes
place
are
sedulously
concealed
and
those
who
preside
over
the
distribution
of
the
pool
and
control
what
is
paid
out
of
it
have
a
direct
interest
in
securing
as
large
a
share
as
possible
for
themselves
and
in
allotting
as
small
a
share
as
possible
to
others
if
one
contributor
takes
less
so
far
from
it
being
evident
that
the
gain
will
go
to
some
one
who
has
put
something
in
and
has
as
good
a
right
as
himself
it
may
go
to
some
one
who
has
put
in
nothing
and
has
no
right
at
all
if
another
claims
more
he
may
secure
it
without
plundering
a
at
the
expense
of
a
sleeping
partner
who
is
believed
to
plunder
both
in
practice
since
there
is
no
clear
principle
determining
what
they
ought
to
take
both
take
all
that
they
can
get
in
such
circumstances
denunciations
of
the
producer
for
exploiting
the
consumer
miss
the
mark
they
are
inevitably
regarded
as
an
economic
version
of
the
military
device
used
by
armies
which
advance
behind
a
screen
of
women
and
children
and
then
protest
at
the
brutality
of
the
enemy
in
shooting
they
are
interpreted
as
evidence
not
that
a
section
of
the
producers
are
exploiting
the
remainder
but
that
a
minority
of
which
is
in
opposition
to
both
can
use
its
economic
power
to
make
efforts
directed
against
those
who
consume
much
and
produce
little
rebound
on
those
who
consume
little
and
produce
much
and
the
grievance
of
which
the
press
makes
so
much
that
some
workers
may
be
taking
too
large
a
share
compared
with
others
is
masked
by
the
much
greater
grievance
of
which
it
says
nothing
whatever
that
some
idlers
take
any
share
at
all
the
abolition
of
payments
which
are
made
without
any
corresponding
economic
service
is
thus
one
of
the
indispensable
conditions
both
of
economic
efficiency
and
industrial
peace
because
their
existence
prevents
different
classes
of
workers
from
restraining
each
other
by
uniting
them
all
against
the
common
enemy
either
the
principle
of
industry
is
that
of
function
in
which
case
slack
work
is
only
less
immoral
than
no
work
at
all
or
it
is
that
of
grab
in
which
case
there
is
no
morality
in
the
matter
but
it
can
not
be
both
and
it
is
useless
either
for
or
for
governments
to
lament
the
mote
in
the
eye
of
the
trade
unions
as
long
as
by
insisting
on
the
maintenance
of
functionless
property
they
decline
to
remove
the
beam
in
their
own
the
truth
is
that
only
workers
can
prevent
the
abuse
of
power
by
workers
because
only
workers
are
recognized
as
possessing
any
title
to
have
their
claims
considered
and
the
first
step
to
preventing
the
exploitation
of
the
consumer
by
the
producer
is
simple
it
is
to
turn
all
men
into
producers
and
thus
to
remove
the
temptation
for
particular
groups
of
workers
to
force
their
claims
at
the
expense
of
the
public
by
removing
the
valid
excuse
that
such
gains
as
they
may
get
are
taken
from
those
who
at
present
have
no
right
to
them
because
they
are
disproportionate
to
service
or
obtained
for
no
service
at
all
indeed
if
work
were
the
only
title
to
payment
the
danger
of
the
community
being
exploited
by
highly
organized
groups
of
producers
would
largely
disappear
for
when
no
payments
were
made
to
there
would
be
no
debatable
ground
for
which
to
struggle
and
it
would
become
evident
that
if
any
one
group
of
producers
took
more
another
must
put
up
with
less
under
such
conditions
a
body
of
workers
who
used
their
strong
strategic
position
to
extort
extravagant
terms
for
themselves
at
the
expense
of
their
might
properly
be
described
as
exploiting
the
community
but
at
present
such
a
statement
is
meaningless
it
is
meaningless
because
before
the
community
can
be
exploited
the
community
must
exist
and
its
existence
in
the
sphere
of
economics
is
not
a
fact
but
only
an
aspiration
the
procedure
by
which
whenever
any
section
of
workers
advance
demands
which
are
regarded
as
inconvenient
by
their
masters
they
are
denounced
as
a
band
of
anarchists
who
are
preying
on
the
public
may
be
a
convenient
weapon
in
an
emergency
but
once
it
is
submitted
to
analysis
it
is
logically
it
has
been
applied
within
recent
years
to
the
postmen
to
the
engineers
to
the
policemen
to
the
miners
and
to
the
railway
men
a
population
with
their
dependents
of
some
eight
million
persons
and
in
the
case
of
the
last
two
the
whole
body
of
organized
labor
made
common
cause
with
those
of
whose
exorbitant
demands
it
was
alleged
to
be
the
victim
but
when
these
workers
and
their
sympathizers
are
deducted
what
is
the
community
which
remains
it
is
a
naÃ¯ve
arithmetic
which
produces
a
total
by
subtracting
one
by
one
all
the
items
which
compose
it
and
the
art
which
discovers
the
public
interest
by
eliminating
the
interests
of
successive
sections
of
the
public
smacks
of
the
rhetorician
rather
than
of
the
statesman
the
truth
is
that
at
present
it
is
idle
to
seek
to
resist
the
demands
of
any
group
of
workers
by
appeals
to
the
interests
of
society
because
as
long
as
the
economic
plane
alone
is
considered
there
is
not
one
society
but
two
which
dwell
together
in
uneasy
juxtaposition
like
sinbad
and
the
old
man
of
the
sea
but
which
in
spirit
in
ideals
and
in
economic
interest
are
worlds
asunder
there
is
the
society
of
those
who
live
by
labor
whatever
their
craft
or
profession
and
the
society
of
those
who
live
on
it
all
the
latter
can
not
command
the
sacrifices
or
the
loyalty
which
are
due
to
the
former
for
they
have
no
title
which
will
bear
inspection
the
instinct
to
ignore
that
tragic
division
instead
of
ending
it
is
amiable
and
sometimes
generous
but
it
is
a
sentimentality
which
is
like
the
morbid
optimism
of
the
consumptive
who
dares
not
admit
even
to
himself
the
virulence
of
his
disease
as
long
as
the
division
exists
the
general
body
of
workers
while
it
may
suffer
from
the
struggles
of
any
one
group
within
it
nevertheless
supports
them
by
its
sympathy
because
all
are
interested
in
the
results
of
the
contest
carried
on
by
each
different
sections
of
workers
will
exercise
mutual
restraint
only
when
the
termination
of
the
struggle
leaves
them
face
to
face
with
each
other
and
not
as
now
with
the
common
enemy
the
ideal
of
a
united
society
in
which
no
one
group
uses
its
power
to
encroach
upon
the
standards
of
another
is
in
short
unattainable
except
through
the
preliminary
abolition
of
functionless
property
those
to
whom
a
leisure
class
is
part
of
an
immutable
order
without
which
civilization
is
inconceivable
dare
not
admit
even
to
themselves
that
the
world
is
poorer
not
richer
because
of
its
existence
so
when
as
now
it
is
important
that
productive
energy
should
be
fully
used
they
stamp
and
cry
and
write
to
about
the
necessity
for
increased
production
though
all
the
time
they
themselves
their
way
of
life
and
expenditure
and
their
very
existence
as
a
leisure
class
are
among
the
causes
why
production
is
not
increased
in
all
their
economic
plans
they
make
one
reservation
that
however
necessitous
the
world
may
be
it
shall
still
support
them
but
men
who
work
do
not
make
that
reservation
nor
is
there
any
reason
why
they
should
and
appeals
to
them
to
produce
more
wealth
because
the
public
needs
it
usually
fall
upon
deaf
ears
even
when
such
appeals
are
not
involved
in
the
ignorance
and
misapprehensions
which
often
characterize
them
for
the
workman
is
not
the
servant
of
the
consumer
for
whose
sake
greater
production
is
demanded
but
of
shareholders
whose
primary
aim
is
dividends
and
to
whom
all
production
however
futile
or
frivolous
so
long
as
it
yields
dividends
is
the
same
it
is
useless
to
urge
that
he
should
produce
more
wealth
for
the
community
unless
at
the
same
time
he
is
assured
that
it
is
the
community
which
will
benefit
in
proportion
as
more
wealth
is
produced
if
every
unnecessary
charge
upon
had
been
eliminated
it
would
be
reasonable
that
the
miners
should
set
a
much
needed
example
by
refusing
to
extort
better
terms
for
themselves
at
the
expense
of
the
public
but
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
work
for
lower
wages
or
longer
hours
as
long
as
those
who
are
responsible
for
the
management
of
the
industry
conduct
it
with
the
extravagance
and
waste
stigmatized
by
the
most
eminent
official
witness
before
the
coal
commission
or
why
the
consumer
should
grumble
at
the
rapacity
of
the
miner
as
long
as
he
allows
himself
to
be
mulcted
by
swollen
profits
the
costs
of
an
ineffective
organization
and
unnecessary
payments
to
superfluous
middlemen
if
the
miner
or
any
other
workman
produces
more
he
has
no
guarantee
that
the
result
will
be
lower
prices
rather
than
higher
dividends
and
larger
royalties
any
more
than
as
a
workman
he
can
determine
the
quality
of
the
wares
which
his
employer
supplies
to
customers
or
the
price
at
which
they
are
sold
nor
as
long
as
he
is
directly
the
servant
of
a
company
and
only
indirectly
the
servant
of
the
community
can
any
such
guarantee
be
offered
him
it
can
be
offered
only
in
so
far
as
he
stands
in
an
immediate
and
direct
relation
to
the
public
for
whom
industry
is
carried
on
so
that
when
all
costs
have
been
met
any
surplus
will
pass
to
it
and
not
to
private
individuals
it
will
be
accepted
only
in
so
far
as
the
workers
in
each
industry
are
not
merely
servants
executing
orders
but
themselves
have
a
collective
responsibility
for
the
character
of
the
service
and
can
use
their
organizations
not
merely
to
protect
themselves
against
exploitation
but
to
make
positive
contributions
to
the
administration
and
development
of
their
industry

thus
it
is
not
only
for
the
sake
of
the
producers
on
whom
the
old
industrial
order
weighed
most
heavily
that
a
new
industrial

is
needed
it
is
needed
for
the
sake
of

the

order
prided
itself
most
and
which
is
flaunted
most
as
an
argument
against

the
ability
to
serve
them
effectively
is
itself
visibly
breaking
down
it
is
breaking
down
at
what
was
always
its
most
vulnerable
point
the
control
of
the
human
beings
whom
with
characteristic
indifference
to
all
but
their
economic
significance
it
distilled
for
its
own
purposes
into
an
abstraction
called
labor
the
first
symptom
of
its
collapse
is
what
the
first
symptom
of
economic
collapses
has
usually
been
in
the
past
the
failure
of
customary
stimuli
to
evoke
their
customary
response
in
human
effort
till
that
failure
is
recognized
and
industry
reorganized
so
that
new
stimuli
may
have
free
play
the
collapse
will
not
correct
itself
but
doubtless
with
spasmodic
revivals
and
flickerings
of
energy
will
continue
and
accelerate
the
cause
of
it
is
simple
it
is
that
those
whose
business
it
is
to
direct
economic
activity
are
increasingly
incapable
of
directing
the
men
upon
whom
economic
activity
depends
the
fault
is
not
that
of
individuals
but
of
a
system
of
industrialism
itself
during
the
greater
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
industry
was
driven
by
two
forces
hunger
and
fear
and
the
employer
commanded
them
both
he
could
grant
or
withhold
employment
as
he
pleased
if
men
revolted
against
his
terms
he
could
dismiss
them
and
if
they
were
dismissed
what
confronted
them
was
starvation
or
the
workhouse
authority
was
centralized
its
instruments
were
passive
the
one
thing
which
they
dreaded
was
unemployment
and
since
they
could
neither
prevent
its
occurrence
nor
do
more
than
a
little
to
mitigate
its
horrors
when
it
occurred
they
submitted
to
a
discipline
which
they
could
not
resist
and
industry
pursued
its
course
through
their
passive
acquiescence
in
a
power
which
could
crush
them
individually
if
they
attempted
to
oppose
it
that
system
might
be
lauded
as
efficient
or
denounced
as
inhuman
but
at
least
as
its
admirers
were
never
tired
of
pointing
out
it
worked
and
like
the
prussian
state
which
alike
in
its
virtues
and
deficiencies
it
not
a
little
resembled
as
long
as
it
worked
it
survived
denunciations
of
its
methods
as
a
strong
man
will
throw
off
a
disease
but
it
is
ceasing
to
have
even
the
qualities
of
its
defects
it
is
ceasing
to
be
efficient
it
no
longer
secures
the
output
of
wealth
which
it
offered
in
its
golden
prime
and
which
enabled
it
to
silence
criticism
by
an
imposing
spectacle
of
material
success
though
it
still
works
it
works
unevenly
amid
constant
friction
and
jolts
and
stoppages
without
the
confidence
of
the
public
and
without
full
confidence
even
in
itself
a
tyrant
who
must
intrigue
and
cajole
where
formerly
he
commanded
a
gaoler
who
if
not
yet
deprived
of
whip
dare
only
administer
moderate
chastisement
and
who
though
he
still
protests
that
he
alone
can
keep
the
treadmill
moving
and
get
the
corn
ground
is
compelled
to
surrender
so
much
of
his
authority
as
to
make
it
questionable
whether
he
is
worth
his
keep
for
the
instruments
through
which
capitalism
exercised
discipline
are
one
by
one
being
taken
from
it
it
can
not
pay
what
wages
it
likes
or
work
what
hours
it
likes
in
industries
the
power
of
arbitrary
dismissal
the
very
center
of
its
authority
is
being
shaken
because
men
will
no
longer
tolerate
a
system
which
makes
their
livelihood
dependent
on
the
caprices
of
an
individual
in
all
industries
alike
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
the
dread
of
starvation
can
no
longer
be
used
to
cow
dissatisfied
workers
into
submission
because
the
public
will
no
longer
allow
involuntary
unemployment
to
result
in
starvation
and
if
capitalism
is
losing
its
control
of
men
bodies
still
more
has
it
lost
its
command
of
their
minds
the
product
of
a
civilization
which
regarded
the
poor
as
instruments
at
worst
of
the
luxuries
at
best
of
the
virtues
of
the
rich
its
psychological
foundation
fifty
years
ago
was
an
ignorance
in
the
mass
of
mankind
which
led
them
to
reverence
as
wisdom
the
very
follies
of
their
masters
and
an
almost
animal
incapacity
for
responsibility
education
and
experience
have
destroyed
the
passivity
which
was
the
condition
of
the
perpetuation
of
industrial
government
in
the
hands
of
an
oligarchy
of
private
capitalists
the
workman
of
has
as
little
belief
in
the
intellectual
superiority
of
many
of
those
who
direct
industry
as
he
has
in
the
morality
of
the
system
it
appears
to
him
to
be
not
only
oppressive
but
wasteful
unintelligent
and
inefficient
in
the
light
of
his
own
experience
in
the
factory
and
the
mine
he
regards
the
claim
of
the
capitalist
to
be
the
guardian
of
public
interests
as
a
piece
of
sanctimonious
hypocrisy
for
he
sees
every
day
that
efficiency
is
sacrificed
to
shortsighted
financial
interests
and
while
as
a
man
he
is
outraged
by
the
inhumanity
of
the
industrial
order
as
a
professional
who
knows
the
difference
between
good
work
and
bad
he
has
a
growing
contempt
at
once
for
its
misplaced
parsimony
and
its
misplaced
extravagance
for
the
whole
apparatus
of
adulteration
advertisement
and
quackery
which
seems
inseparable
from
the
pursuit
of
profit
as
the
main
standard
of
industrial
success
so
capitalism
no
longer
secures
strenuous
work
by
fear
for
it
is
ceasing
to
be
formidable
and
it
can
not
secure
it
by
respect
for
it
has
ceased
to
be
respected
and
the
very
victories
by
which
it
seeks
to
reassert
its
waning
prestige
are
more
disastrous
than
defeats
employers
may
congratulate
themselves
that
they
have
maintained
intact
their
right
to
freedom
of
management
or
opposed
successfully
a
demand
for
public
ownership
or
broken
a
movement
for
higher
wages
and
shorter
hours
but
what
is
success
in
a
trade
dispute
or
in
a
political
struggle
is
often
a
defeat
in
the
workshop
the
workmen
may
have
lost
but
it
does
not
follow
that
their
employers
still
less
that
the
public
which
is
principally
composed
of
workmen
have
won
for
the
object
of
industry
is
to
produce
goods
and
to
produce
them
at
the
lowest
cost
in
human
effort
but
there
is
no
alchemy
which
will
secure
efficient
production
from
the
resentment
or
distrust
of
men
who
feel
contempt
for
the
order
under
which
they
work
it
is
a
commonplace
that
credit
is
the
foundation
of
industry
but
credit
is
a
matter
of
psychology
and
the
workman
has
his
psychology
as
well
as
the
capitalist
if
confidence
is
necessary
to
the
investment
of
capital
confidence
is
not
less
necessary
to
the
effective
performance
of
labor
by
men
whose
sole
livelihood
depends
upon
it
if
they
are
not
yet
strong
enough
to
impose
their
will
they
are
strong
enough
to
resist
when
their
masters
would
impose
theirs
they
may
work
rather
than
strike
but
they
will
work
to
escape
dismissal
not
for
the
greater
glory
of
a
system
in
which
they
do
not
believe
and
if
they
are
dismissed
those
who
take
their
place
will
do
the
same
that
this
is
one
cause
of
a
low
output
has
been
stated
both
by
employers
and
workers
in
the
building
industry
and
by
the
representatives
of
the
miners
before
the
coal
commission
it
was
reiterated
with
impressive
emphasis
by
justice
sankey
nor
is
it
seriously
contested
by
employers
themselves
what
else
indeed
do
their
repeated
denunciations
of
restriction
of
output
mean
except
that
they
have
failed
to
organize
industry
so
as
to
secure
the
efficient
service
which
it
is
their
special
function
to
provide
nor
is
it
appropriate
to
the
situation
to
indulge
in
denunciations
of
the
selfishness
of
the
working
classes
to
draw
an
indictment
against
a
whole
nation
is
a
procedure
which
is
as
impossible
in
industry
as
it
is
in
politics
institutions
must
be
adapted
to
human
nature
not
human
nature
to
institutions
if
the
effect
of
the
industrial
system
is
such
that
a
large
and
increasing
number
of
ordinary
men
and
women
find
that
it
offers
them
no
adequate
motive
for
economic
effort
it
is
mere
pedantry
to
denounce
men
and
women
instead
of
amending
the
system
thus
the
time
has
come
when
absolutism
in
industry
may
still
win
its
battles
but
loses
the
campaign
and
loses
it
on
the
very
ground
of
economic
efficiency
which
was
of
its
own
selection
in
the
period
of
transition
while
economic
activity
is
distracted
by
the
struggle
between
those
who
have
the
name
and
habit
of
power
but
no
longer
the
full
reality
of
it
and
those
who
are
daily
winning
more
of
the
reality
of
power
but
are
not
yet
its
recognized
repositories
it
is
the
consumer
who
suffers
he
has
neither
the
service
of
docile
obedience
nor
the
service
of
intelligent
for
slavery
will
work
as
long
as
the
slaves
will
let
it
and
freedom
will
work
when
men
have
learned
to
be
free
but
what
will
not
work
is
a
combination
of
the
two
so
the
public
goes
short
of
coal
not
only
because
of
the
technical
deficiencies
of
the
system
under
which
it
is
raised
and
distributed
but
because
the
system
itself
has
lost
its
driving
force
because
the
coal
owners
can
no
longer
persuade
the
miners
into
producing
more
dividends
for
them
and
more
royalties
for
the
owners
of
minerals
while
the
public
can
not
appeal
to
them
to
put
their
whole
power
into
serving
itself
because
it
has
chosen
that
they
should
be
the
servants
not
of
itself
but
of
shareholders
and
this
dilemma
is
not
as
some
suppose
temporary
the
aftermath
of
war
or
peculiar
to
the
coal
industry
as
though
the
miners
alone
were
the
children
of
sin
which
in
the
last
few
months
they
have
been
described
to
be
it
is
permanent
it
has
spread
far
and
as
sleeping
spirits
are
stirred
into
life
by
education
and
one
industry
after
another
develops
a
strong
corporate
consciousness
it
will
spread
further
nor
will
it
be
resolved
by
lamentations
or
menaces
or
denunciations
of
leaders
whose
only
significance
is
that
they
say
openly
what
plain
men
feel
privately
for
the
matter
at
bottom
is
one
of
psychology
what
has
happened
is
that
the
motives
on
which
the
industrial
system
relied
for
several
generations
to
secure
efficiency
secure
it
no
longer
and
it
is
as
impossible
to
restore
them
to
revive
by
mere
exhortation
the
complex
of
hopes
and
fears
and
ignorance
and
patient
credulity
and
passive
acquiescence
which
together
made
men
fifty
years
ago
plastic
instruments
in
the
hands
of
industrialism
as
to
restore
innocence
to
any
others
of
those
who
have
eaten
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
the
ideal
of
some
intelligent
and
respectable
business
men
the
restoration
of
the
golden
sixties
when
workmen
were
docile
and
confiding
and
trade
unions
were
still
half
illegal
and
foreign
competition
meant
english
competition
in
foreign
countries
and
prices
were
rising
a
little
and
not
rising
too
much
is
the
one
utopia
which
can
never
be
realized
the
king
may
walk
naked
as
long
as
his
courtiers
protest
that
he
is
clad
but
when
a
child
or
a
fool
has
broken
the
spell
a
tailor
is
more
important
than
all
their
admiration
if
the
public
which
suffers
from
the
slackening
of
economic
activity
desires
to
end
its
it
will
not
laud
as
admirable
and
the
operation
of
motives
which
are
plainly
ceasing
to
move
it
will
seek
to
liberate
new
motives
and
to
enlist
them
in
its
service
it
will
endeavor
to
find
an
alternative
to
incentives
which
were
always
degrading
to
those
who
used
them
as
much
as
to
those
upon
whom
they
were
used
and
which
now
are
adequate
incentives
no
longer
and
the
alternative
to
the
discipline
which
capitalism
exercised
through
its
instruments
of
unemployment
and
starvation
is
the
of
responsibility
and
professional
pride
so
the
demand
which
aims
at
stronger
organization
fuller
responsibility
larger
powers
for
the
sake
of
the
producer
as
a
condition
of
economic
liberty
the
demand
for
freedom
is
not
antithetic
to
the
demand
for
more
effective
work
and
increased
output
which
is
being
made
in
the
interests
of
the
consumer
it
is
complementary
to
it
as
the
insistence
by
a
body
of
professional
men
whether
doctors
or
university
teachers
on
the
maintenance
of
their
professional
independence
and
dignity
against
attempts
to
cheapen
the
service
is
not
hostile
to
an
efficient
service
but
in
the
long
run
a
condition
of
it
the
course
of
wisdom
for
the
consumer
would
be
to
hasten
so
far
as
he
can
the
transition
for
as
at
present
conducted
industry
is
working
against
the
grain
it
is
compassing
sea
and
land
in
its
efforts
to
overcome
by
ingenious
financial
and
technical
expedients
obstacles
which
should
never
have
existed
it
is
trying
to
produce
its
results
by
conquering
professional
feeling
instead
of
using
it
it
is
carrying
not
only
its
inevitable
economic
burdens
but
an
ever
increasing
load
of
ill
will
and
skepticism
it
has
in
fact
shot
the
bird
which
caused
the
wind
to
blow
and
goes
about
its
business
with
the
corpse
round
its
neck
compared
with
that
psychological
incubus
the
technical
deficiencies
of
industry
serious
though
they
often
are
are
a
bagatelle
and
the
business
men
who
preach
the
gospel
of
production
without
offering
any
plan
for
dealing
with
what
is
now
the
central
fact
in
the
economic
situation
resemble
a
christian
apologist
who
should
avoid
disturbing
the
equanimity
of
his
audience
by
carefully
omitting
all
reference
either
to
the
fall
of
man
or
the
scheme
of
salvation
if
it
is
desired
to
increase
the
output
of
wealth
it
is
not
a
paradox
but
the
statement
of
an
elementary
economic
truism
to
say
that
active
and
constructive
on
the
part
of
the
rank
and
file
of
workers
would
do
more
to
contribute
to
that
result
than
the
discovery
of
a
new
or
a
generation
of
scientific
invention
the
first
condition
of
enlisting
on
the
side
of
constructive
work
the
professional
feeling
which
is
now
apathetic
or
even
hostile
to
it
is
to
secure
that
when
it
is
given
its
results
accrue
to
the
public
not
to
the
owner
of
property
in
capital
in
land
or
in
other
resources
for
this
reason
the
attenuation
of
the
rights
at
present
involved
in
the
private
ownership
of
industrial
capital
or
their
complete
abolition
is
not
the
demand
of
idealogues
but
an
indispensable
element
in
a
policy
of
economic
efficiency
since
it
is
the
condition
of
the
most
effective
functioning
of
the
human
beings
upon
whom
though
like
other
truisms
it
is
often
forgotten
economic
efficiency
ultimately
depends
but
it
is
only
one
element
may
range
from
mere
acquiescence
to
a
vigilant
and
zealous
initiative
the
criterion
of
an
effective
system
of
administration
is
that
it
should
succeed
in
enlisting
in
the
conduct
of
industry
the
latent
forces
of
professional
pride
to
which
the
present
industrial
order
makes
little
appeal
and
which
indeed
capitalism
in
its
war
upon
trade
union
organization
endeavored
for
many
years
to
stamp
out
altogether
nor
does
the
efficacy
of
such
an
appeal
repose
upon
the
assumption
of
that
change
in
human
nature
which
is
the
triumphant
ad
advanced
by
those
who
are
least
satisfied
with
the
working
of
human
nature
as
it
is
what
it
does
involve
is
that
certain
elementary
facts
should
be
taken
into
account
instead
of
as
at
present
being
ignored
that
all
work
is
distasteful
and
that
every
man
desires
to
secure
the
largest
income
with
the
least
effort
may
be
as
axiomatic
as
it
is
assumed
to
be
but
in
practice
it
makes
all
the
difference
to
the
attitude
of
the
individual
whether
the
collective
sentiment
of
the
group
to
which
he
belongs
is
on
the
side
of
effort
or
against
it
and
what
standard
of
effort
it
sets
that
as
employers
complain
the
public
opinion
of
considerable
groups
of
workers
is
against
an
intensification
of
effort
as
long
as
part
of
its
result
is
increased
dividends
for
shareholders
is
no
doubt
as
far
as
mere
efficiency
is
concerned
the
gravest
indictment
of
the
existing
industrial
order
but
even
when
public
ownership
has
taken
the
place
of
private
capitalism
its
ability
to
command
effective
service
will
depend
ultimately
upon
its
success
in
securing
not
merely
that
professional
feeling
is
no
longer
an
opposing
force
but
that
it
is
actively
enlisted
upon
the
side
of
maintaining
the
highest
possible
standard
of
efficiency
which
can
reasonably
be
demanded
to
put
the
matter
concretely
while
the
existing
ownership
of
mines
is
a
positive
inducement
to
inefficient
work
public
ownership
administered
by
a
bureaucracy
if
it
would
remove
the
technical
deficiencies
emphasized
by
sir
richard
redmayne
as
inseparable
from
the
separate
administration
of
pits
by
different
companies
would
be
only
too
likely
to
miss
a
capital
advantage
which
a
different
type
of
administration
would
secure
it
would
lose
both
the
assistance
to
be
derived
from
the
technical
knowledge
of
practical
men
who
know
by
daily
experience
the
points
at
which
the
details
of
administration
can
be
improved
and
the
stimulus
to
efficiency
springing
from
the
corporate
pride
of
a
profession
which
is
responsible
for
maintaining
and
improving
the
character
of
its
service
professional
spirit
is
a
force
like
gravitation
which
in
itself
is
neither
good
nor
bad
but
which
the
engineer
uses
when
he
can
to
do
his
work
for
him
if
it
is
foolish
to
idealize
it
it
is
equally
shortsighted
to
neglect
it
in
what
are
described
as
the
services
it
has
always
been
recognized
that
de
is
the
foundation
of
efficiency
and
all
means
some
wise
and
some
mischievous
are
used
to
encourage
it
in
practice
indeed
the
power
upon
which
the
country
relied
as
its
main
safeguard
in
an
emergency
was
the
professional
zeal
of
the
navy
and
nothing
else
nor
is
that
spirit
peculiar
to
the
professions
which
are
concerned
with
war
it
is
a
matter
of
common
training
common
responsibilities
and
common
dangers
in
all
cases
where
difficult
and
disagreeable
work
is
to
be
done
the
force
which
elicits
it
is
normally
not
merely
money
but
the
public
opinion
and
tradition
of
the
little
society
in
which
the
individual
moves
and
in
the
esteem
of
which
he
finds
that
which
men
value
in
success
to
ignore
that
most
powerful
of
stimuli
as
it
is
ignored
and
then
to
lament
that
the
efforts
which
it
produces
are
not
forthcoming
is
the
climax
of
perversity
to
aim
at
eliminating
from
industry
the
growth
and
action
of
corporate
feeling
for
fear
lest
an
organized
body
of
producers
should
exploit
the
public
is
a
plausible
policy
but
it
is
it
is
to
pour
away
the
baby
with
the
bath
and
to
lower
the
quality
of
the
service
in
an
attempt
to
safeguard
it
a
wise
system
of
administration
would
recognize
that
professional
solidarity
can
do
much
of
its
work
for
it
more
effectively
than
it
can
do
it
itself
because
the
spirit
of
his
profession
is
part
of
the
individual
and
not
a
force
outside
him
and
would
make
it
its
object
to
enlist
that
temper
in
the
public
service
it
is
only
by
that
policy
indeed
that
the
elaboration
of
cumbrous
regulations
to
prevent
men
doing
what
they
should
not
with
the
incidental
result
of
sometimes
preventing
them
from
doing
what
they
should
it
is
only
by
that
policy
that
what
is
mechanical
and
obstructive
in
bureaucracy
can
be
averted
for
industry
can
not
run
without
laws
it
must
either
control
itself
by
professional
standards
or
it
must
be
controlled
by
officials
who
are
not
of
the
craft
and
who
however
zealous
and
can
hardly
have
the
feel
of
it
in
their
fingers
public
control
and
criticism
are
indispensable
but
they
should
not
be
too
detailed
or
they
defeat
themselves
it
would
be
better
that
once
fair
standards
have
been
established
the
professional
organization
should
check
offenses
against
prices
and
quality
than
that
it
should
be
necessary
for
the
state
to
do
so
the
alternative
to
minute
external
supervision
is
supervision
from
within
by
men
who
become
imbued
with
the
public
obligations
of
their
trade
in
the
very
process
of
learning
it
it
is
in
short
professional
in
industry
for
this
reason
collectivism
by
itself
is
too
simple
a
solution
its
failure
is
likely
to
be
that
of
other
rationalist
systems
dann
hat

die

leider
nur
das

if
industrial
reorganization
is
to
be
a
living
reality
and
not
merely
a
plan
upon
paper
its
aim
must
be
to
secure
not
only
that
industry
is
carried
on
for
the
service
of
the
public
but
that
it
shall
be
carried
on
with
the
active
of
the
organizations
of
producers
but
involves
responsibility
and
responsibility
involves
power
it
is
idle
to
expect
that
men
will
give
their
best
to
any
system
which
they
do
not
trust
or
that
they
will
trust
any
system
in
the
control
of
which
they
do
not
share
their
ability
to
carry
professional
obligations
depends
upon
the
power
which
they
possess
to
remove
the
obstacles
which
prevent
those
obligations
from
being
discharged
and
upon
their
willingness
when
they
possess
the
power
to
use
it
two
causes
appear
to
have
hampered
the
committees
which
were
established
in
connection
with
coal
mines
during
the
war
to
increase
the
output
of
coal
one
was
the
reluctance
of
some
of
them
to
discharge
the
invidious
task
of
imposing
penalties
for
absenteeism
on
their
the
other
was
the
exclusion
of
faults
of
management
from
the
control
of
many
committees
in
some
cases
all
went
well
till
they
demanded
that
if
the
miners
were
penalized
for
absenteeism
which
was
due
to
them
the
management
should
be
penalized
similarly
when
men
who
desired
to
work
were
sent
home
because
as
a
result
of
defective
organization
there
was
no
work
for
them
to
do
their
demand
was
resisted
as
interference
with
the
management
and
the
attempt
to
enforce
regularity
of
attendance
broke
down
nor
to
take
another
example
from
the
same
industry
is
it
to
be
expected
that
the
weight
of
the
miners
organization
will
be
thrown
on
to
the
side
of
greater
production
if
it
has
no
power
to
insist
on
the
removal
of
the
defects
of
equipment
and
organization
the
shortage
of
trams
rails
tubs
and
timber
the
creaming
of
the
pits
by
the
working
of
easily
got
coal
to
their
future
detriment
their
wasteful
layout
caused
by
the
vagaries
of
separate
ownership
by
which
at
present
the
output
is
reduced
the
public
can
not
have
it
both
ways
if
it
allows
workmen
to
be
treated
as
hands
it
can
not
claim
the
service
of
their
wills
and
their
brains
if
it
desires
them
to
show
the
zeal
of
skilled
professionals
it
must
secure
that
they
have
sufficient
power
to
allow
of
their
discharging
professional
responsibilities
in
order
that
workmen
may
abolish
any
restrictions
on
output
which
may
be
imposed
by
them
they
must
be
able
to
insist
on
the
abolition
of
the
restrictions
more
mischievous
because
more
effective
which
as
the
committee
on
trusts
has
recently
told
us
are
imposed
by
organizations
of
employers
in
order
that
the
miners
leaders
instead
of
merely
bargaining
as
to
wages
hours
and
working
conditions
may
be
able
to
appeal
to
their
members
to
increase
the
supply
of
coal
they
must
be
in
a
position
to
secure
the
removal
of
the
causes
of
low
output
which
are
due
to
the
deficiencies
of
the
management
and
which
are
a
far
more
serious
obstacle
than
any
reluctance
on
the
part
of
the
miner
if
the
workmen
in
the
building
trade
are
to
take
combined
action
to
accelerate
production
they
must
as
a
body
be
consulted
as
to
the
purpose
to
which
their
energy
is
to
be
applied
and
must
not
be
expected
to
build
fashionable
houses
when
what
are
required
are
cottages
to
house
families
which
are
at
present
living
with
three
persons
to
a
room
it
is
deplorable
indeed
that
any
human
beings
should
consent
to
degrade
themselves
by
producing
the
articles
which
a
considerable
number
of
workmen
turn
out
boots
which
are
partly
brown
paper
and
furniture
which
is
not
fit
to
use
the
revenge
of
outraged
humanity
is
certain
though
it
is
not
always
obvious
and
the
penalty
paid
by
the
consumer
for
tolerating
an
organization
of
industry
which
in
the
name
of
efficiency
destroyed
the
responsibility
of
the
workman
is
that
the
service
with
which
he
is
provided
is
not
even
efficient
he
has
always
paid
it
though
he
has
not
seen
it
in
quality
he
is
beginning
to
realize
that
he
is
likely
to
pay
it
in
quantity
as
well
if
the
public
is
to
get
efficient
service
it
can
get
it
only
from
human
beings
with
the
initiative
and
caprices
of
human
beings
it
will
get
it
in
short
in
so
far
as
it
treats
industry
as
a
responsible
profession
the
collective
responsibility
of
the
workers
for
the
maintenance
of
the
standards
of
their
profession
is
then
the
alternative
to
the
discipline
which
capitalism
exercised
in
the
past
and
which
is
now
breaking
down
it
involves
a
fundamental
change
in
the
position
both
of
employers
and
of
trade
unions
as
long
as
the
direction
of
industry
is
in
the
hands
of
or
their
agents
who
are
concerned
to
extract
from
it
the
maximum
profit
for
themselves
a
trade
union
is
necessarily
a
defensive
organization
absorbed
on
the
one
hand
in
the
struggle
to
resist
the
downward
thrust
of
capitalism
upon
the
workers
standard
of
life
and
denounced
on
the
other
if
it
presumes
to
interfere
with
management
even
when
management
is
most
obviously
inefficient
it
is
an
opposition
which
never
becomes
a
government
and
which
has
neither
the
will
nor
the
power
to
assume
responsibility
for
the
quality
of
the
service
offered
to
the
consumer
if
the
abolition
of
functionless
property
transferred
the
control
of
production
to
bodies
representing
those
who
perform
constructive
work
and
those
who
consume
the
goods
produced
the
relation
of
the
worker
to
the
public
would
no
longer
be
indirect
but
immediate
and
associations
which
are
now
purely
defensive
would
be
in
a
position
not
merely
to
criticize
and
oppose
but
to
advise
to
initiate
and
to
enforce
upon
their
own
members
the
obligations
of
the
craft
it
is
obvious
that
in
such
circumstances
the
service
offered
the
consumer
however
carefully
safeguarded
by
his
representation
on
the
authorities
controlling
each
industry
would
depend
primarily
upon
the
success
of
professional
organizations
in
finding
a
substitute
for
the
discipline
exercised
by
the
agents
of
it
would
be
necessary
for
them
to
maintain
by
their
own
action
the
zeal
efficiency
and
professional
pride
which
when
the
barbarous
weapons
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
been
discarded
would
be
the
only
guarantee
of
a
high
level
of
production
nor
once
this
new
function
has
been
made
possible
for
professional
organizations
is
there
any
extravagance
in
expecting
them
to
perform
it
with
reasonable
competence
how
far
economic
motives
are
balked
and
could
be
strengthened
by
a
different
type
of
industrial
organization
to
what
extent
and
under
what
conditions
it
is
possible
to
enlist
in
the
services
of
industry
motives
which
are
not
purely
economic
can
be
ascertained
only
after
a
study
of
the
psychology
of
work
which
has
not
yet
been
made
such
a
study
to
be
of
value
must
start
by
abandoning
the
conventional
assumptions
popularized
by
economic
textbooks
and
accepted
as
by
practical
men
that
the
motives
to
effort
are
simple
and
constant
in
character
like
the
pressure
of
steam
in
a
boiler
that
they
are
identical
throughout
all
ranges
of
economic
activity
from
the
stock
exchange
to
the
shunting
of
wagons
or
laying
of
bricks
and
that
they
can
be
elicited
and
strengthened
only
by
directly
economic
incentives
in
so
far
as
motives
in
industry
have
been
considered
hitherto
it
has
usually
been
done
by
writers
who
like
most
exponents
of
scientific
management
have
started
by
assuming
that
the
categories
of
business
psychology
could
be
offered
with
equal
success
to
all
classes
of
workers
and
to
all
types
of
productive
work
those
categories
appear
to
be
derived
from
a
simplified
analysis
of
the
mental
processes
of
the
company
promoter
financier
or
investor
and
their
validity
as
an
interpretation
of
the
motives
and
habits
which
determine
the
attitude
to
his
work
of
the
bricklayer
the
miner
the
dock
laborer
or
the
engineer
is
precisely
the
point
in
question
clearly
there
are
certain
types
of
industry
to
which
they
are
only
partially
relevant
it
can
hardly
be
assumed
for
example
that
the
degree
of
skill
and
energy
brought
to
his
work
by
a
surgeon
a
scientific
investigator
a
teacher
a
medical
officer
of
health
an
indian
civil
servant
and
a
peasant
proprietor
are
capable
of
being
expressed
precisely
and
to
the
same
degree
in
terms
of
the
economic
advantage
which
those
different
occupations
offer
obviously
those
who
pursue
them
are
influenced
to
some
considerable
though
uncertain
extent
by
economic
incentives
obviously
again
the
precise
character
of
each
process
or
step
in
the
exercise
of
their
respective
avocations
the
performance
of
an
operation
the
carrying
out
of
a
piece
of
investigation
the
selection
of
a
particular
type
of
educational
method
the
preparation
of
a
report
the
decision
of
a
case
or
the
care
of
live
stock
is
not
immediately
dependent
upon
an
exact
calculation
of
pecuniary
gain
or
loss
what
appears
to
be
the
case
is
that
in
certain
walks
of
life
while
the
occupation
is
chosen
after
a
consideration
of
its
economic
advantages
and
while
economic
reasons
exact
the
minimum
degree
of
activity
needed
to
avert
dismissal
from
it
or
failure
the
actual
level
of
energy
or
proficiency
displayed
depend
largely
upon
conditions
of
a
different
order
among
them
are
the
character
of
the
training
received
before
and
after
entering
the
occupation
the
customary
standard
of
effort
demanded
by
the
public
opinion
of
one
fellows
the
desire
for
the
esteem
of
the
small
circle
in
which
the
individual
moves
and
to
be
recognized
as
having
made
good
and
not
to
have
failed
interest
in
one
work
ranging
from
devotion
to
a
determination
to
do
justice
to
it
the
pride
of
the
craftsman
the
tradition
of
the
service
it
would
be
foolish
to
suggest
that
any
considerable
body
of
men
are
uninfluenced
by
economic
considerations
but
to
represent
them
as
amenable
to
such
incentives
only
is
to
give
a
quite
unreal
and
bookish
picture
of
the
actual
conditions
under
which
the
work
of
the
world
is
carried
on
how
large
a
part
such
considerations
play
varies
from
one
occupation
to
another
according
to
the
character
of
the
work
which
it
does
and
the
manner
in
which
it
is
organized
in
what
is
called
industry
calculations
of
pecuniary
gain
and
loss
are
more
powerful
than
in
most
of
the
professions
though
even
in
industry
they
are
more
constantly
present
to
the
minds
of
the
business
men
who
direct
it
than
to
those
of
the
managers
and
technicians
most
of
whom
are
paid
fixed
salaries
or
to
the
rank
and
file
of
in
the
professions
of
teaching
and
medicine
in
many
branches
of
the
public
service
the
necessary
qualities
are
secured
without
the
intervention
of
the
capitalist
employer
partly
by
pecuniary
incentives
partly
by
training
and
education
partly
by
the
acceptance
on
the
part
of
those
entering
them
of
the
traditional
obligations
of
their
profession
as
part
of
the
normal
framework
of
their
working
lives
but
this
difference
is
not
constant
and
unalterable
it
springs
from
the
manner
in
which
different
types
of
occupation
are
organized
on
the
training
which
they
offer
and
the
which
they
cultivate
among
their
members
the
psychology
of
a
vocation
can
in
fact
be
changed
new
motives
can
be
elicited
provided
steps
are
taken
to
allow
them
free
expression
it
is
as
feasible
to
turn
building
into
an
organized
profession
with
a
relatively
high
code
of
public
honor
as
it
was
to
do
the
same
for
medicine
or
teaching
the
truth
is
that
we
ought
radically
to
revise
the
presuppositions
as
to
human
motives
on
which
current
presentations
of
economic
theory
are
ordinarily
founded
and
in
terms
of
which
the
discussion
of
economic
question
is
usually
carried
on
the
assumption
that
the
stimulus
of
imminent
personal
want
is
either
the
only
spur
or
a
sufficient
spur
to
productive
effort
is
a
relic
of
a
crude
psychology
which
has
little
warrant
either
in
past
history
or
in
present
experience
it
derives
what
plausibility
it
possesses
from
a
confusion
between
work
in
the
sense
of
the
lowest
of
activity
needed
to
escape
actual
starvation
and
the
work
which
is
given
irrespective
of
the
fact
that
elementary
wants
may
already
have
been
satisfied
through
the
natural
disposition
of
ordinary
men
to
maintain
and
of
extraordinary
men
to
improve
upon
the
level
of
exertion
accepted
as
reasonable
by
the
public
opinion
of
the
group
of
which
they
are
members
it
is
the
old
difference
forgotten
by
society
as
often
as
it
is
learned
between
the
labor
of
the
free
man
and
that
of
the
slave
economic
fear
may
secure
the
minimum
effort
needed
to
escape
economic
penalties
what
however
has
made
progress
possible
in
the
past
and
what
it
may
be
suggested
matters
to
the
world
is
not
the
bare
minimum
which
is
required
to
avoid
actual
want
but
the
capacity
of
men
to
bring
to
bear
upon
their
tasks
a
degree
of
energy
which
while
it
can
be
stimulated
by
economic
incentives
yields
results
far
in
excess
of
any
which
are
necessary
merely
to
avoid
the
extremes
of
hunger
or
destitution
that
capacity
is
a
matter
of
training
tradition
and
habit
at
least
as
much
as
of
pecuniary
stimulus
and
the
ability
of
a
professional
association
representing
the
public
opinion
of
a
group
of
workers
to
raise
it
is
therefore
considerable
once
industry
has
been
liberated
from
its
subservience
to
the
interests
of
the
functionless
it
is
in
this
sphere
that
trade
unions
may
be
expected
increasingly
to
find
their
function
its
importance
both
for
the
general
interests
of
the
community
and
for
the
special
interests
of
particular
groups
of
workers
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
technical
knowledge
and
managerial
skill
are
likely
to
be
available
as
readily
for
a
committee
appointed
by
the
workers
in
an
industry
as
for
a
committee
appointed
as
now
by
the
shareholders
but
it
is
more
and
more
evident
that
the
crux
of
the
economic
situation
is
not
the
technical
deficiencies
of
industrial
organization
but
the
growing
inability
of
those
who
direct
industry
to
command
the
active
good
will
of
the
their
is
promised
by
the
conversion
of
industry
into
a
profession
serving
the
public
and
promised
as
far
as
can
be
judged
by
that
alone
nor
is
the
assumption
of
the
new
and
often
disagreeable
obligations
of
internal
discipline
and
public
responsibility
one
which
trade
unionism
can
afford
once
the
change
is
accomplished
to
shirk
however
alien
they
may
be
to
its
present
traditions
for
ultimately
if
by
slow
degrees
power
follows
the
ability
to
wield
it
authority
goes
with
function
the
workers
can
not
have
it
both
ways
they
must
choose
whether
to
assume
the
responsibility
for
industrial
discipline
and
become
free
or
to
repudiate
it
and
continue
to
be
serfs
if
organized
as
professional
bodies
they
can
provide
a
more
effective
service
than
that
which
is
now
with
increasing
difficulty
extorted
by
the
agents
of
capital
they
will
have
made
good
their
hold
upon
the
future
if
they
can
not
they
will
remain
among
the
less
calculable
instruments
of
production
which
many
of
them
are
the
instinct
of
mankind
warns
it
against
accepting
at
their
face
value
spiritual
demands
which
can
not
justify
themselves
by
practical
achievements
and
the
road
along
which
the
organized
workers
like
any
other
class
must
climb
to
power
starts
from
the
provision
of
a
more
effective
economic
service
than
their
masters
as
their
grip
upon
industry
becomes
increasingly
vacillating
and
uncertain
are
able
to
supply
x
the
position
of
the
brain
worker
the
conversion
of
industry
into
a
profession
will
involve
at
least
as
great
a
change
in
the
position
of
the
management
as
in
that
of
the
manual
workers
as
each
industry
is
organized
for
the
performance
of
function
the
employer
will
cease
to
be
a
profit
maker
and
become
what
in
so
far
as
he
holds
his
position
by
a
reputable
title
he
already
is
one
workman
among
others
in
some
industries
where
the
manager
is
a
capitalist
as
well
the
alteration
may
take
place
through
such
a
limitation
of
his
interest
as
a
capitalist
as
it
has
been
proposed
by
employers
and
workers
to
introduce
into
the
building
industry
in
others
where
the
whole
work
of
administration
rests
on
the
shoulders
of
salaried
managers
it
has
already
in
part
been
carried
out
the
economic
conditions
of
this
change
have
indeed
been
prepared
by
the
separation
of
ownership
from
management
and
by
the
growth
of
an
intellectual
proletariat
to
whom
the
scientific
and
managerial
work
of
industry
is
increasingly
intrusted
the
concentration
of
businesses
the
elaboration
of
organization
and
the
developments
springing
from
the
application
of
science
to
industry
have
resulted
in
the
multiplication
of
a
body
of
industrial
brain
workers
who
make
the
old
classifications
into
employers
and
workmen
which
is
still
current
in
common
speech
an
absurdly
misleading
description
of
the
industrial
system
as
it
exists
to
complete
the
transformation
all
that
is
needed
is
that
this
new
class
of
officials
who
fifty
years
ago
were
almost
unknown
should
recognize
that
they
like
the
manual
workers
are
the
victims
of
the
domination
of
property
and
that
both
professional
pride
and
economic
interest
require
that
they
should
throw
in
their
lot
with
the
rest
of
those
who
are
engaged
in
constructive
work
their
position
is
often
indeed
very
far
from
being
a
happy
one
many
of
them
like
some
mine
managers
are
miserably
paid
their
tenure
of
their
posts
is
sometimes
highly
insecure
their
opportunities
for
promotion
may
be
few
and
distributed
with
a
singular
capriciousness
they
see
the
prizes
of
industry
awarded
by
favoritism
or
by
the
nepotism
which
results
in
the
head
of
a
business
unloading
upon
it
a
family
of
sons
whom
it
would
be
economical
to
pay
to
keep
out
of
it
and
which
indignantly
denounced
on
the
rare
occasions
on
which
it
occurs
in
the
public
service
is
so
much
the
rule
in
private
industry
that
no
one
even
questions
its
propriety
during
the
war
they
have
found
that
while
the
organized
workers
have
secured
advances
their
own
salaries
have
often
remained
almost
stationary
because
they
have
been
too
genteel
to
take
part
in
trade
unionism
and
that
they
are
sometimes
paid
less
than
the
men
for
whose
work
they
are
supposed
to
be
responsible
regarded
by
the
workmen
as
the
of
the
masters
and
by
their
employers
as
one
section
among
the
rest
of
the
hands
they
have
the
odium
of
capitalism
without
its
power
or
its
profits
from
the
conversion
of
industry
into
a
profession
those
who
at
present
do
its
intellectual
work
have
as
much
to
gain
as
the
manual
workers
for
the
principle
of
function
for
which
we
have
pleaded
as
the
basis
of
industrial
organization
supplies
the
only
intelligible
standard
by
which
the
powers
and
duties
of
the
different
groups
engaged
in
industry
can
be
determined
at
the
present
time
no
such
standard
exists
the
social
order
of
the
era
of
which
faint
traces
have
survived
in
the
forms
of
academic
organization
was
marked
by
a
careful
grading
of
the
successive
stages
in
the
progress
from
apprentice
to
master
each
of
which
was
distinguished
by
clearly
defined
rights
and
duties
varying
from
grade
to
grade
and
together
forming
a
hierarchy
of
functions
the
industrial
system
which
developed
in
the
course
of
the
nineteenth
century
did
not
admit
any
principle
of
organization
other
than
the
convenience
of
the
individual
who
by
enterprise
skill
good
fortune
unscrupulous
energy
or
mere
nepotism
happened
at
any
moment
to
be
in
a
position
to
wield
economic
authority
his
powers
were
what
he
could
exercise
his
rights
were
what
at
any
time
he
could
assert
the
lancashire
of
the
fifties
was
like
the
cyclops
a
law
unto
himself
hence
since
subordination
and
discipline
are
indispensable
in
any
complex
undertaking
the
subordination
which
emerged
in
industry
was
that
of
servant
to
master
and
the
discipline
such
as
economic
strength
could
impose
upon
economic
weakness
the
alternative
to
the
allocation
of
power
by
the
struggle
of
individuals
for
is
its
allocation
according
to
function
that
each
group
in
the
complex
process
of
production
should
wield
so
much
authority
as
and
no
more
authority
than
is
needed
to
enable
it
to
perform
the
special
duties
for
which
it
is
responsible
an
organization
of
industry
based
on
this
principle
does
not
imply
the
merging
of
specialized
economic
functions
in
an
undifferentiated
industrial
democracy
or
the
obliteration
of
the
brain
workers
beneath
the
sheer
mass
of
artisans
and
laborers
but
it
is
incompatible
with
the
unlimited
exercise
of
economic
power
by
any
class
or
individual
it
would
have
as
its
fundamental
rule
that
the
only
powers
which
a
man
can
exercise
are
those
conferred
upon
him
in
virtue
of
his
office
there
would
be
subordination
but
it
would
be
profoundly
different
from
that
which
exists
for
it
would
not
be
the
subordination
of
one
man
to
another
but
of
all
men
to
the
purpose
for
which
industry
is
carried
on
there
would
be
authority
but
it
would
not
be
the
authority
of
the
individual
who
imposes
rules
in
virtue
of
his
economic
power
for
the
attainment
of
his
economic
advantage
it
would
be
the
authority
springing
from
the
necessity
of
combining
different
duties
to
attain
a
common
end
there
would
be
discipline
but
it
would
be
the
discipline
involved
in
pursuing
that
end
not
the
discipline
enforced
upon
one
man
for
the
convenience
or
profit
of
another
under
such
an
organization
of
industry
the
brain
worker
might
expect
as
never
before
to
come
to
his
own
he
would
be
estimated
and
promoted
by
his
capacity
not
by
his
means
he
would
be
less
likely
than
at
present
to
find
doors
closed
to
him
because
of
poverty
his
judges
would
be
his
colleagues
not
an
owner
of
property
intent
on
dividends
he
would
not
suffer
from
the
perversion
of
values
which
rates
the
talent
and
energy
by
which
wealth
is
created
lower
than
the
possession
of

at

the
coal
industry
is
concerned
the
question
of
security
and
salaries
need
hardly
be
discussed
the
greatest
admirer
of
the
present
system
would
not
argue
that
security
of
status
is
among
the
advantages
which
it
offers
to
its
employees
it
is
notorious
that
in
some
districts
at
least
managers
are
liable
to
be
dismissed
however
professionally
competent
they
may
be
if
they
express
in
public
views
which
are
not
approved
by
the
directors
of
their
company
indeed
the
criticism
which
is
normally
made
on
the
public
services
and
made
not
wholly
without
reason
is
that
the
security
which
they
offer
is
excessive
on
the
question
of
salaries
rather
more
than
of
the
colliery
companies
of
great
britain
themselves
supplied
figures
to
the
coal
industry
commission
if
their
returns
may
be
trusted
it
would
appear
that
are
paid
as
a
class
salaries
the
parsimony
of
which
is
the
more
surprising
in
view
of
the
emphasis
laid
and
quite
properly
laid
by
the
on
the
managers
responsibilities
the
service
of
the
state
does
not
normally
offer
and
ought
not
to
offer
financial
prizes
comparable
with
those
of
private
industry
but
it
is
improbable
had
the
mines
been
its
property
during
the
last
ten
years
that
more
than
the
managers
would
have
been
in
receipt
of
salaries
of
under
per
year
and
of
less
than
in
by
which
time
prices
had
more
than
doubled
and
the
aggregate
profits
of
the
of
which
the
greater
part
was
however
taken
by
the
state
in
taxation
had
amounted
in
five
years
to
it
would
be
misleading
to
suggest
that
the
salaries
paid
to
are
typical
of
private
industry
nor
need
it
be
denied
that
the
probable
effect
of
turning
an
industry
into
a
public
service
would
be
to
reduce
the
size
of
the
largest
prizes
at
present
offered
what
is
to
be
expected
is
that
the
lower
and
medium
salaries
would
be
raised
and
the
largest
somewhat
diminished
it
is
hardly
to
be
denied
at
any
rate
that
the
majority
of
brain
workers
in
industry
have
nothing
to
fear
on
financial
grounds
from
such
a
change
as
is
proposed
by
justice
sankey
under
the
normal
organization
of
industry
profits
it
can
not
be
too
often
insisted
do
not
go
to
them
but
to
shareholders
there
does
not
appear
to
be
any
reason
to
suppose
that
the
salaries
of
managers
in
the
mines
making
more
than
profit
a
ton
were
any
larger
than
those
making
under
the
financial
aspect
of
the
change
is
not
however
the
only
point
which
a
group
of
managers
or
technicians
have
to
consider
they
have
also
to
weigh
its
effect
on
their
professional
status
will
they
have
as
much
freedom
initiative
and
authority
in
the
service
of
the
community
as
under
private
ownership
how
that
question
is
answered
depends
upon
the
form
given
to
the
administrative
system
through
which
a
public
service
is
conducted
it
is
possible
to
conceive
an
arrangement
under
which
the
life
of
a
would
be
made
a
burden
to
him
by
perpetual
recalcitrance
on
the
part
of
the
men
at
the
pit
for
which
he
is
responsible
it
is
possible
to
conceive
one
under
which
he
would
be
hampered
to
the
point
of
paralysis
by
irritating
interference
from
a
bureaucracy
at
headquarters
in
the
past
some
managers
of
workshops
suffered
it
would
seem
from
the
former
many
officers
of
employment
exchanges
are
the
victims
unless
common
rumor
is
misleading
of
the
latter
it
is
quite
legitimate
indeed
it
is
indispensable
that
these
dangers
should
be
emphasized
the
problem
of
reorganizing
industry
is
as
has
been
said
above
a
problem
of
constitution
making
it
is
likely
to
be
handled
successfully
only
if
the
defects
to
which
different
types
of
constitutional
machinery
are
likely
to
be
liable
are
pointed
out
in
advance
once
however
these
dangers
are
realized
to
devise
precautions
against
them
appears
to
be
a
comparatively
simple
matter
if
justice
sankey
proposals
be
taken
as
a
concrete
example
of
the
position
which
would
be
occupied
by
the
managers
in
a
nationalized
industry
it
will
be
seen
that
they
do
not
involve
either
of
the
two
dangers
which
are
pointed
out
above
the
manager
will
it
is
true
work
with
a
local
mining
council
or
pit
committee
which
is
to
meet
fortnightly
or
oftener
if
need
be
to
advise
the
manager
on
all
questions
concerning
the
direction
and
safety
of
the
mine
and
if
the
manager
refuses
to
take
the
advice
of
the
local
mining
council
on
any
question
concerning
the
safety
and
health
of
the
mine
such
question
shall
be
referred
to
the
district
mining
council
it
is
true
also
that
once
such
a
local
mining
council
is
formally
established
the
manager
will
find
it
necessary
to
win
its
confidence
to
lead
by
persuasion
not
by
mere
driving
to
establish
in
short
the
same
relationships
of
comradeship
and
good
will
as
ought
to
exist
between
the
colleagues
in
any
common
undertaking
but
in
all
this
there
is
nothing
to
undermine
his
authority
unless
authority
be
understood
to
mean
an
arbitrary
power
which
no
man
is
fit
to
exercise
and
which
few
men
in
their
sober
moments
would
claim
the
manager
will
be
appointed
by
and
responsible
to
not
the
men
whose
work
he
supervises
but
the
district
mining
council
which
controls
all
the
pits
in
a
district
and
on
that
council
he
will
be
represented
nor
will
he
be
at
the
mercy
of
a
distant
clerkocracy
overwhelming
him
with
circulars
and
overriding
his
expert
knowledge
with
impracticable
mandates
devised
in
london
the
very
kernel
of
the
schemes
advanced
both
by
justice
sankey
and
by
the
miners
federation
is
decentralized
administration
within
the
framework
of
a
national
system
there
is
no
question
of
managing
the
industry
from
whitehall
the
characteristics
of
different
vary
so
widely
that
reliance
on
local
knowledge
and
experience
are
essential
and
it
is
to
local
knowledge
and
experience
that
it
is
proposed
to
intrust
the
administration
of
the
industry
the
constitution
which
is
recommended
is
in
short
not
unitary
but
federal
there
will
be
a
division
of
functions
and
power
between
central
authorities
and
district
authorities
the
former
will
lay
down
general
rules
as
to
those
matters
which
must
necessarily
be
dealt
with
on
a
national
basis
the
latter
will
administer
the
industry
within
their
own
districts
and
as
long
as
they
comply
with
those
rules
and
provide
their
quota
of
coal
will
possess
local
autonomy
and
will
follow
the
method
of
working
the
pits
which
they
think
best
suited
to
local
conditions
thus
interpreted
public
ownership
does
not
appear
to
confront
the
brain
worker
with
the
danger
of
unintelligent
interference
with
his
special
technique
of
which
he
is
quite
naturally
apprehensive
it
offers
him
indeed
far
larger
opportunities
of
professional
development
than
are
open
to
all
but
a
favored
few
when
the
considerations
of
productive
efficiency
which
it
is
his
special
to
promote
are
liable
to
be
overridden
by
financial
interests
operating
through
the
pressure
of
a
board
of
directors
who
desire
to
show
an
immediate
profit
to
their
shareholders
and
who
to
obtain
it
will
cream
the
pit
or
work
it
in
a
way
other
than
considerations
of
technical
efficiency
would
dictate
and
the
interest
of
the
community
in
securing
that
the
manager
professional
skill
is
liberated
for
the
service
of
the
public
is
as
great
as
his
own
for
the
economic
developments
of
the
last
thirty
years
have
made
the
managerial
and
technical
of
industry
the
repositories
of
public
responsibilities
of
quite
incalculable
importance
which
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
they
can
hardly
at
present
discharge
the
most
salient
characteristic
of
modern
industrial
organization
is
that
production
is
carried
on
under
the
general
direction
of
business
men
who
do
not
themselves
necessarily
know
anything
of
productive
processes
business
and
industry
tend
to
an
increasing
extent
to
form
two
compartments
which
though
united
within
the
same
economic
system
employ
different
types
of
evoke
different
qualities
and
recognize
different
standards
of
efficiency
and
workmanship
the
technical
and
managerial
staff
of
industry
is
of
course
as
amenable
as
other
men
to
economic
incentives
but
their
special
work
is
production
not
finance
and
provided
they
are
not
smarting
under
a
sense
of
economic
injustice
they
want
like
most
workmen
to
see
the
job
done
properly
the
business
men
who
ultimately
control
industry
are
concerned
with
the
promotion
and
capitalization
of
companies
with
competitive
selling
and
the
advertisement
of
wares
the
control
of
markets
the
securing
of
special
advantages
and
the
arrangement
of
pools
combines
and
monopolies
they
are
preoccupied
in
fact
with
financial
results
and
are
interested
in
the
actual
making
of
goods
only
in
so
far
as
financial
results
accrue
from
it
the
change
in
organization
which
has
to
a
considerable
degree
specialized
the
spheres
of
business
and
management
is
comparable
in
its
importance
to
that
which
separated
business
and
labor
a
century
and
a
half
ago
it
is
specially
momentous
for
the
consumer
as
long
as
the
functions
of
manager
technician
and
capitalist
were
combined
as
in
the
classical
era
of
the
factory
system
in
the
single
person
of
the
employer
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
assume
that
profits
and
productive
efficiency
ran
similarly
together
in
such
circumstances
the
ingenuity
with
which
economists
proved
that
in
obedience
to
the
law
of
substitution
he
would
choose
the
most
economical
process
machine
or
type
of
organization
wore
a
certain
plausibility
true
the
employer
might
even
so
adulterate
his
goods
or
exploit
the
labor
of
a
helpless
class
of
workers
but
as
long
as
the
person
directing
industry
was
himself
primarily
a
manager
he
could
hardly
have
the
training
ability
or
time
even
if
he
had
the
inclination
to
concentrate
special
attention
on
financial
gains
unconnected
with
or
opposed
to
progress
in
the
arts
of
production
and
there
was
some
justification
for
the
conventional
picture
which
represented
the
manufacturer
as
the
guardian
of
the
interests
of
the
consumer
with
the
drawing
apart
of
the
financial
and
technical
departments
of
industry
with
the
separation
of
business
from
production
the
link
which
bound
profits
to
productive
efficiency
is
tending
to
be
snapped
there
are
more
ways
than
formerly
of
securing
the
former
without
achieving
the
latter
and
when
it
is
pleaded
that
the
interests
of
the
captain
of
industry
stimulate
the
adoption
of
the
most
economical
methods
and
thus
secure
industrial
progress
it
is
necessary
to
ask
economical
for
whom
though
the
organization
of
industry
which
is
most
efficient
in
the
sense
of
offering
the
consumer
the
best
service
at
the
lowest
real
cost
may
be
that
which
is
most
profitable
to
the
firm
it
is
also
true
that
profits
are
constantly
made
in
ways
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
efficient
production
and
which
sometimes
indeed
impede
it
the
manner
in
which
business
may
find
that
the
methods
which
pay
itself
best
are
those
which
a
truly
scientific
management
would
condemn
may
be
illustrated
by
three
examples
in
the
first
place
the
whole
mass
of
profits
which
are
obtained
by
the
adroit
capitalization
of
a
new
business
or
the
reconstruction
of
one
which
already
exists
have
hardly
any
connection
with
production
at
all
when
for
instance
a
lancashire
cotton
mill
capitalized
at
is
bought
by
a
london
syndicate
which
it
with
a
capital
of
not
at
all
an
extravagant
case
what
exactly
has
happened
in
many
cases
the
equipment
of
the
mill
for
production
remains
after
the
process
what
it
was
before
it
it
is
however
valued
at
a
different
figure
because
it
is
anticipated
that
the
product
of
the
mill
will
sell
at
a
price
which
will
pay
a
reasonable
profit
not
only
upon
the
lower
but
upon
the
higher
capitalization
if
the
apparent
state
of
the
market
and
prospects
of
the
industry
are
such
that
the
public
can
be
induced
to
believe
this
the
promoters
of
the
reconstruction
find
it
worth
while
to
recapitalize
the
mill
on
the
new
basis
they
make
their
profit
not
as
manufacturers
but
as
financiers
they
do
not
in
any
way
add
to
the
productive
efficiency
of
the
firm
but
they
acquire
shares
which
will
entitle
them
to
an
increased
return
normally
if
the
market
is
favorable
they
part
with
the
greater
number
of
them
as
soon
as
they
are
acquired
but
whether
they
do
so
or
not
what
has
occurred
is
a
process
by
which
the
business
element
in
industry
obtains
the
right
to
a
larger
share
of
the
product
without
in
any
way
increasing
the
efficiency
of
the
service
which
is
offered
to
the
consumer
other
examples
of
the
manner
in
which
the
control
of
production
by
business
cuts
across
the
line
of
economic
progress
are
the
wastes
of
competitive
industry
and
the
profits
of
monopoly
it
is
well
known
that
the
price
paid
by
the
consumer
includes
marketing
costs
which
to
a
varying
but
to
a
large
extent
are
expenses
not
of
supplying
the
goods
but
of
supplying
them
under
conditions
involving
the
expenses
of
advertisement
and
competitive
distribution
for
the
individual
firm
such
expenses
which
enable
it
to
absorb
part
of
a
rival
trade
may
be
an
economy
to
the
consumer
of
milk
or
coal
to
take
two
flagrant
instances
they
are
pure
loss
nor
as
is
sometimes
assumed
are
such
wastes
confined
to
distribution
technical
reasons
are
stated
by
railway
managers
to
make
desirable
a
unification
of
railway
administration
and
by
mining
experts
of
mines
but
up
to
the
war
business
considerations
maintained
the
expensive
system
under
which
each
railway
company
was
operated
as
a
separate
system
and
still
prevent
collieries
even
collieries
in
the
same
district
from
being
administered
as
parts
of
a
single
organization
pits
are
drowned
out
by
water
because
companies
can
not
agree
to
apportion
between
them
the
costs
of
a
common
drainage
system
materials
are
bought
and
products
sold
separately
because
collieries
will
not
combine
small
coal
is
left
in
to
the
amount
of
millions
of
tons
because
the
most
economical
and
technically
efficient
working
of
the
seams
is
not
necessarily
that
which
yields
the
largest
profit
to
the
business
men
who
control
production
in
this
instance
the
wide
differences
in
economic
strength
which
exist
between
different
mines
discourage
the
unification
which
is
economically
desirable
naturally
the
directors
of
a
company
which
owns
a
good
thing
do
not
desire
to
merge
interests
with
a
company
working
coal
that
is
poor
in
quality
or
expensive
to
mine
when
as
increasingly
happens
in
other
industries
competitive
wastes
or
some
of
them
are
eliminated
by
combination
there
is
a
genuine
advance
in
technical
efficiency
which
must
be
set
to
the
credit
of
business
motives
in
that
event
however
the
divergence
between
business
interests
and
those
of
the
consumers
is
merely
pushed
one
stage
further
forward
it
arises
of
course
over
the
question
of
prices
if
any
one
is
disposed
to
think
that
this
picture
of
the
economic
waste
which
accompanies
the
domination
of
production
by
business
interests
is
overdrawn
he
may
be
invited
to
consider
the
criticisms
upon
the
system
passed
by
the
efficiency
engineers
who
are
increasingly
being
called
upon
to
advise
as
to
industrial
organization
and
equipment
the
higher
officers
of
the
corporation
writes
gantt
of
a
public
utility
company
established
in
america
during
the
war
have
all
without
exception
been
men
of
the
type
of
mind
who
have
made
their
success
through
financiering
buying
selling
etc
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
well
known
that
our
industrial
system
has
not
measured
up
as
we
had
expected
reason
for
its
falling
short
is
undoubtedly
that
the
men
directing
it
had
been
trained
in
a
business
system
operated
for
profits
and
did
not
understand
one
operated
solely
for
this
is
no
criticism
of
the
men
as
individuals
they
simply
did
not
know
the
job
and
what
is
worse
they
did
not
know
that
they
did
not
know
it
in
so
far
then
as
business
and
management
are
separated
the
latter
being
employed
under
the
direction
of
the
former
it
can
not
be
assumed
that
the
direction
of
industry
is
in
the
hands
of
persons
whose
primary
concern
is
productive
efficiency
that
a
considerable
degree
of
efficiency
will
result
incidentally
from
the
pursuit
of
business
profits
is
not
of
course
denied
what
seems
to
be
true
however
is
that
the
main
interest
of
those
directing
an
industry
which
has
reached
this
stage
of
development
is
given
to
financial
strategy
and
the
control
of
markets
because
the
gains
which
these
activities
offer
are
normally
so
much
larger
than
those
accruing
from
the
mere
improvement
of
the
processes
of
production
it
is
evident
however
that
it
is
precisely
that
improvement
which
is
the
main
interest
of
the
consumer
he
may
tolerate
large
profits
as
long
as
they
are
thought
to
be
the
symbol
of
efficient
production
but
what
he
is
concerned
with
is
the
supply
of
goods
not
the
value
of
shares
and
when
profits
appear
to
be
made
not
by
efficient
production
but
by
skilful
financiering
or
shrewd
commercial
tactics
they
no
longer
appear
meritorious
if
in
disgust
at
what
he
has
learned
to
call
profiteering
the
consumer
seeks
an
alternative
to
a
system
under
which
product
is
controlled
by
business
he
can
hardly
find
it
except
by
making
an
ally
of
the
managerial
and
technical
of
industry
they
organize
the
service
which
he
requires
they
are
relatively
little
implicated
either
by
material
interest
or
by
psychological
bias
in
the
financial
methods
which
he
distrusts
they
often
find
the
control
of
their
professions
by
business
men
who
are
primarily
financiers
irritating
in
the
obstruction
which
it
offers
to
technical
efficiency
as
well
as
sharp
and
in
the
treatment
of
salaries
both
on
public
and
professional
grounds
they
belong
to
a
group
which
ought
to
take
the
initiative
in
promoting
a
partnership
between
the
producers
and
the
public
they
can
offer
the
community
the
scientific
knowledge
and
specialized
ability
which
is
the
most
important
condition
of
progress
in
the
arts
of
production
it
can
offer
them
a
more
secure
and
dignified
status
larger
opportunities
for
the
exercise
of
their
special
talents
and
the
consciousness
that
they
are
giving
the
best
of
their
work
and
their
lives
not
to
enriching
a
handful
of
uninspiring
if
innocuous
shareholders
but
to
the
service
of
the
great
body
of
their
if
the
last
advantage
be
dismissed
as
a
phrase
if
medical
officers
of
health
directors
of
education
directors
of
the
wholesale
be
assumed
to
be
quite
uninfluenced
by
any
consciousness
of
social
service
the
first
two
at
any
rate
remain
and
they
are
considerable
it
is
this
gradual
disengagement
of
managerial
technique
from
financial
interests
which
would
appear
the
probable
line
along
which
the
employer
of
the
future
will
develop
the
substitution
throughout
industry
of
fixed
salaries
for
fluctuating
profits
would
in
itself
deprive
his
position
of
half
the
humiliating
atmosphere
of
predatory
enterprise
which
embarrasses
any
man
of
honor
who
finds
himself
when
he
has
been
paid
for
his
services
in
possession
of
a
surplus
for
which
there
is
no
assignable
reason
nor
once
large
incomes
from
profits
have
been
extinguished
need
his
salary
be
large
as
incomes
are
reckoned
it
is
said
that
among
the
barbarians
where
wealth
is
still
measured
by
cattle
great
chiefs
are
described
as
men
the
manager
of
a
great
enterprise
who
is
paid
a
year
might
similarly
be
described
as
a
man
since
he
receives
the
income
of
a
hundred
families
it
is
true
that
special
talent
is
worth
any
price
and
that
a
payment
of
a
year
to
the
head
of
a
business
with
a
turnover
of
millions
is
economically
a
bagatelle
but
economic
considerations
are
not
the
only
considerations
there
is
also
the
point
of
honor
and
the
truth
is
that
these
salaries
are
ungentlemanly
when
really
important
issues
are
at
stake
every
one
realizes
that
no
decent
man
can
stand
out
for
his
price
a
general
does
not
haggle
with
his
government
for
the
precise
pecuniary
equivalent
of
his
contribution
to
victory
a
sentry
who
gives
the
alarm
to
a
sleeping
battalion
does
not
spend
next
day
collecting
the
capital
value
of
the
lives
he
has
saved
he
is
paid
a
day
and
is
lucky
if
he
gets
it
the
commander
of
a
ship
does
not
cram
himself
and
his
belongings
into
the
boats
and
leave
the
crew
to
scramble
out
of
the
wreck
as
best
they
can
by
the
tradition
of
the
service
he
is
the
last
man
to
leave
there
is
no
reason
why
the
public
should
insult
manufacturers
and
men
of
business
by
treating
them
as
though
they
were
more
than
generals
and
more
extravagant
than
privates
to
say
that
they
are
worth
a
good
deal
more
than
even
the
exorbitant
salaries
which
a
few
of
them
get
is
often
true
but
it
is
beside
the
point
no
one
has
any
business
to
expect
to
be
paid
what
he
is
worth
for
what
he
is
worth
is
a
matter
between
his
own
soul
and
god
what
he
has
a
right
to
demand
and
what
it
concerns
his
to
see
that
he
gets
is
enough
to
enable
him
to
perform
his
work
when
industry
is
organized
on
a
basis
of
function
that
and
no
more
than
that
is
what
he
will
be
paid
to
do
the
managers
of
industry
justice
this
whining
for
more
money
is
a
vice
to
which
they
as
distinct
from
their
shareholders
are
not
particularly
prone
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
be
if
a
man
has
important
work
and
enough
leisure
and
income
to
enable
him
to
do
it
properly
he
is
in
possession
of
as
much
happiness
as
is
good
for
any
of
the
children
of
adam
the
coal
mines
department
supplied
the
following
figures
to
the
coal
industry
commission
vol
iii
app
they
relate
to
per
cent
of
the
collieries
of
the
united
kingdom
salary
including
bonus
and
number
of
managers
value
of
house
and
coal
or
less
to
to
to
to
to
and
over
xi
porro
unum
necessarium
so
the
organization
of
society
on
the
basis
of
function
instead
of
on
that
of
rights
implies
three
things
it
means
first
that
proprietary
rights
shall
be
maintained
when
they
are
accompanied
by
the
performance
of
service
and
abolished
when
they
are
not
it
means
second
that
the
producers
shall
stand
in
a
direct
relation
to
the
community
for
whom
production
is
carried
on
so
that
their
responsibility
to
it
may
be
obvious
and
unmistakable
not
lost
as
at
present
through
their
immediate
subordination
to
shareholders
whose
interest
is
not
service
but
gain
it
means
in
the
third
place
that
the
obligation
for
the
maintenance
of
the
service
shall
rest
upon
the
professional
organization
of
those
who
perform
it
and
that
subject
to
the
supervision
and
criticism
of
the
consumer
those
organizations
shall
exercise
so
much
voice
in
the
government
of
industry
as
may
be
needed
to
secure
that
the
obligation
is
discharged
it
is
obvious
indeed
that
no
change
of
system
or
machinery
can
avert
those
causes
of
social
which
consist
in
the
egotism
greed
or
quarrelsomeness
of
human
nature
what
it
can
do
is
to
create
an
environment
in
which
those
are
not
the
qualities
which
are
encouraged
it
can
not
secure
that
men
live
up
to
their
principles
what
it
can
do
is
to
establish
their
social
order
upon
principles
to
which
if
they
please
they
can
live
up
and
not
live
down
it
can
not
control
their
actions
it
can
offer
them
an
end
on
which
to
fix
their
minds
and
as
their
minds
are
so
in
the
long
run
and
with
exceptions
their
practical
activity
will
be
the
first
condition
of
the
right
organization
of
industry
is
then
the
intellectual
conversion
which
in
their
distrust
of
principles
englishmen
are
disposed
to
place
last
or
to
omit
altogether
it
is
that
emphasis
should
be
transferred
from
the
opportunities
which
it
offers
individuals
to
the
social
functions
which
it
performs
that
they
should
be
clear
as
to
its
end
and
should
judge
it
by
reference
to
that
end
not
by
incidental
consequences
which
are
foreign
to
it
however
brilliant
or
alluring
those
consequences
may
be
what
gives
its
meaning
to
any
activity
which
is
not
purely
automatic
is
its
purpose
it
is
because
the
purpose
of
industry
which
is
the
conquest
of
nature
for
the
service
of
man
is
neither
adequately
expressed
in
its
organization
nor
present
to
the
minds
of
those
engaged
in
it
because
it
is
not
regarded
as
a
function
but
as
an
opportunity
for
personal
gain
or
advancement
or
display
that
the
economic
life
of
modern
societies
is
in
a
perpetual
state
of
morbid
irritation
if
the
conditions
which
produce
that
unnatural
tension
are
to
be
removed
it
can
only
be
effected
by
the
growth
of
a
habit
of
mind
which
will
approach
questions
of
economic
organization
from
the
standpoint
of
the
purpose
which
it
exists
to
serve
and
which
will
apply
to
it
something
of
the
spirit
expressed
by
bacon
when
he
said
that
the
work
of
man
ought
to
be
carried
on
for
the
glory
of
god
and
the
relief
of
estate
viewed
from
that
angle
issues
which
are
insoluble
when
treated
on
the
basis
of
rights
may
be
found
more
susceptible
of
reasonable
treatment
for
a
purpose
is
in
the
first
place
a
principle
of
limitation
it
determines
the
end
for
which
and
therefore
the
limits
within
which
an
activity
is
to
be
carried
on
it
divided
what
is
worth
doing
from
what
is
not
and
settles
the
scale
upon
which
what
is
worth
doing
ought
to
be
done
it
is
in
the
second
place
a
principle
of
unity
because
it
supplies
a
common
end
to
which
efforts
can
be
directed
and
submits
interests
which
would
otherwise
conflict
to
the
judgment
of
an
object
it
is
in
the
third
place
a
principle
of
apportionment
or
distribution
it
assigns
to
the
different
parties
of
groups
engaged
in
a
common
undertaking
the
place
which
they
are
to
occupy
in
carrying
it
out
thus
it
establishes
order
not
upon
chance
or
power
but
upon
a
principle
and
bases
remuneration
not
upon
what
men
can
with
good
fortune
snatch
for
themselves
nor
upon
what
if
unlucky
they
can
be
induced
to
accept
but
upon
what
is
appropriate
to
their
function
no
more
and
no
less
so
that
those
who
perform
no
function
receive
no
payment
and
those
who
contribute
to
the
common
end
receive
honourable
payment
for
honourable
service

the
famous
lines
in
which
piccarda
explains
to
dante
the
order
of
paradise
are
a
description
of
a
complex
and
multiform
society
which
is
united
by
overmastering
devotion
to
a
common
end
by
that
end
all
stations
are
assigned
and
all
activities
are
valued
the
parts
derive
their
quality
from
their
place
in
the
system
and
are
so
permeated
by
the
unity
which
they
express
that
they
themselves
are
glad
to
be
forgotten
as
the
ribs
of
an
arch
carry
the
eye
from
the
floor
from
which
they
spring
to
the
vault
in
which
they
meet
and
interlace
such
a
combination
of
unity
and
diversity
is
possible
only
to
a
society
which
subordinates
its
activities
to
the
principle
of
purpose
for
what
that
principle
offers
is
not
merely
a
standard
for
determining
the
relations
of
different
classes
and
groups
of
producers
but
a
scale
of
moral
values
above
all
it
assigns
to
economic
activity
itself
its
proper
place
as
the
servant
not
the
master
of
society
the
burden
of
our
civilization
is
not
merely
as
many
suppose
that
the
product
of
industry
is
or
its
conduct
tyrannical
or
its
operation
interrupted
by
embittered
disagreements
it
is
that
industry
itself
has
come
to
hold
a
position
of
exclusive
predominance
among
human
interests
which
no
single
interest
and
least
of
all
the
provision
of
the
material
means
of
existence
is
fit
to
occupy
like
a
hypochondriac
who
is
so
absorbed
in
the
processes
of
his
own
digestion
that
he
goes
to
his
grave
before
he
has
begun
to
live
industrialized
communities
neglect
the
very
objects
for
which
it
is
worth
while
to
acquire
riches
in
their
feverish
preoccupation
with
the
means
by
which
riches
can
be
acquired
that
obsession
by
economic
issues
is
as
local
and
transitory
as
it
is
repulsive
and
disturbing
to
future
generations
it
will
appear
as
pitiable
as
the
obsession
of
the
seventeenth
century
by
religious
quarrels
appears
indeed
it
is
less
rational
since
the
object
with
which
it
is
concerned
is
less
important
and
it
is
a
poison
which
inflames
every
wound
and
turns
each
trivial
scratch
into
a
malignant
ulcer
society
will
not
solve
the
particular
problems
of
industry
which
afflict
it
until
that
poison
is
expelled
and
it
has
learned
to
see
industry
itself
in
the
right
perspective
if
it
is
to
do
that
it
must
rearrange
its
scale
of
values
it
must
regard
economic
interests
as
one
element
in
life
not
as
the
whole
of
life
it
must
persuade
its
members
to
renounce
the
opportunity
of
gains
which
accrue
without
any
corresponding
service
because
the
struggle
for
them
keeps
the
whole
community
in
a
fever
it
must
so
organize
industry
that
the
instrumental
character
of
economic
activity
is
emphasized
by
its
subordination
to
the
social
purpose
