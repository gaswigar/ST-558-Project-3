reported
crisply
and
barked
a

explosive
syllables

two

readers
amazing
stories
literally
clamored
for
a
sequel
to
the
famous
story
the
skylark
of
space
which
appeared
exactly
two
years
ago
except
that
skylark
three
is
more
thrilling
more
exciting
and
even
more
chockful
of
science
than
the
other
smith
tells
about
the
story
in
his
author
note
far
better

author
note
to
all
profound
thinkers
in
the
realms
of
science
who
may
chance
to
read
skylark
three
greetings
i
have
taken
certain
liberties
with
several
more
or
less
commonly
accepted
theories
but
i
assure
you
that
those
theories
have
not
been
violated
altogether
in
ignorance
some
of
them
i
myself
believe
sound
others
i
consider
unsound
still
others
are
out
of
my
line
so
that
i
am
not
well
enough
informed
upon
their
basic
mathematical
foundations
to
have
come
to
any
definite
conclusion
one
way
or
the
other
whether
or
not
i
consider
any
theory
sound
i
did
not
hesitate
to
disregard
it
if
its
literal
application
would
have
interfered
with
the
logical
development
of
the
story
in
the
skylark
of
space
garby
and
i
decided
after
some
discussion
to
allow
two
mathematical
impossibilities
to
stand
one
of
these
immediately
became
the
target
of
critics
from
maine
to
california
and
while
no
astronomer
has
as
yet
called
attention
to
the
other
i
would
not
be
surprised
to
hear
about
it
even
at
this
late
date
while
i
do
not
wish
it
understood
that
i
regard
any
of
the
major
features
of
this
story
as
likely
to
become
facts
in
the
near
future
indeed
it
has
been
my
aim
to
portray
the
highly
improbable
it
is
my
belief
that
there
is
no
mathematical
or
scientific
impossibility
to
be
found
in
skylark
three
in
fact
even
though
i
have
repeatedly
violated
theories
in
which
i
myself
believe
i
have
in
every
case
taken
great
pains
to
make
certain
that
the
most
rigid
mathematical
analysis
of
which
i
am
capable
has
failed
to
show
that
i
have
violated
any
known
and
proven
scientific
fact
by
fact
i
do
not
mean
the
kind
of
reasoning
based
upon
assumptions
later
shown
to
be
fallacious
by
which
it
was
proved
that
the
transatlantic
cable
and
the
airplane
were
scientifically
impossible
i
refer
to
definitely
known
phenomena
which
no
possible
future
development
can
change
i
refer
to
mathematical
proofs
whose
fundamental
equations
and
operations
involve
no
assumptions
and
contain
no
uncertainties
please
bear
in
mind
that
we
know
very
little
it
has
been
widely
believed
that
the
velocity
of
light
is
the
limiting
velocity
and
many
of
our
leading
authorities
hold
this
view
but
it
can
not
be
proved
and
is
by
no
means
universally
held
in
this
connection
it
would
appear
that
thompson
in
beyond
the
electron
shows
to
his
own
satisfaction
at
least
that
velocities
vastly
greater
than
that
of
light
are
not
only
possible
but
necessary
to
any
comprehensive
investigation
into
the
nature
of
the
electron
we
do
not
know
the
nature
of
light
neither
the
undulatory
theory
nor
the
quantum
theory
are
adequate
to
explain
all
observed
phenomena
and
they
seem
to
be
mutually
exclusive
since
it
would
seem
clear
by
definition
that
no
one
thing
can
be
at
the
same
time
continuous
and
discontinuous
we
know
nothing
of
the
ether
we
do
not
even
know
whether
or
not
it
exists
save
as
a
concept
of
our
own
extremely
limited
intelligence
we
are
in
total
ignorance
of
the
ultimate
structure
of
matter
and
of
the
arrangement
and
significance
of
those
larger
aggregations
of
matter
the
galaxies
we
do
not
know
nor
understand
nor
can
we
define
even
such
fundamental
necessities
as
time
and
space
why
prate
of
the
impossible

i
duquesne
goes
traveling
in
the
innermost
private
office
of
steel
brookings
and
duquesne
stared
at
each
other
across
the
massive
desk
duquesne
voice
was
cold
his
black
brows
were
drawn
together
get
this
brookings
and
get
it
straight
i
shoving
off
at
twelve
tonight
my
advice
to
you
is
to
lay
off
richard
seaton
absolutely
do
do
a
thing
hold
keep
on
holding
it
until
i
get
back
no
matter
how
long
that
may
be
duquesne
shot
out
in
an
icy
tone
i
am
very
much
surprised
at
your
change
of
front
doctor
you
are
the
last
man
i
would
have
expected
to
be
scared
off
after
one
engagement
do
be
any
more
of
a
fool
than
you
have
to
brookings
there
a
lot
of
difference
between
scared
and
knowing
when
you
are
simply
wasting
effort
as
you
remember
i
tried
to
abduct
seaton
by
picking
her
off
with
an
attractor
from
a
i
would
have
bet
that
nothing
could
have
stopped
me
well
when
they
located
me
probably
with
an
automatic
osnomian
and
heated
me
while
i
was
still
better
than
two
hundred
miles
up
i
knew
then
and
there
that
they
had
us
stopped
that
there
was
nothing
we
could
do
except
go
back
to
my
plan
abandon
the
abduction
idea
and
eventually
kill
them
all
since
my
plan
would
take
time
you
objected
to
it
and
sent
an
airplane
to
drop
a
bomb
on
them
airplane
bomb
and
all
simply
vanished
it
did
explode
you
remember
just
flashed
into
light
and
disappeared
with
scarcely
any
noise
then
you
pulled
several
more
of
your
fool
ideas
such
as
bombardment
and
so
on
none
of
them
worked
still
you
got
the
nerve
to
think
that
you
can
get
them
with
ordinary
gunmen
i
drawn
you
diagrams
and
shown
you
figures
i
told
you
in
great
detail
and
in
words
exactly
what
we
up
against
now
i
tell
you
again
that
they
if
you
had
the
brains
of
a
pinhead
you
would
know
that
anything
i
ca
do
with
a
ca
be
done
by
a
mob
of
ordinary
gangsters
i
telling
you
brookings
that
you
ca
do
it
my
way
is
absolutely
the
only
way
that
will
work
but
five
years
doctor
i
may
be
back
in
six
months
but
on
a
trip
of
this
kind
anything
can
happen
so
i
am
planning
on
being
gone
five
years
even
that
may
not
be
enough
i
am
carrying
supplies
for
ten
years
and
that
box
of
mine
in
the
vault
is
not
to
be
opened
until
ten
years
from
today
but
surely
we
shall
be
able
to
remove
the
obstructions
ourselves
in
a
few
weeks
we
always
have
oh
quit
kidding
yourself
brookings
this
is
no
time
for
idiocy
you
stand
just
as
much
chance
of
killing
seaton
please
doctor
please
do
talk
like
that
still
squeamish
eh
your
pussyfooting
always
did
give
me
an
acute
pain
i
for
direct
action
word
and
deed
first
last
and
all
the
time
i
repeat
you
have
exactly
as
much
chance
of
killing
richard
seaton
as
a
blind
kitten
has
how
do
you
arrive
at
that
conclusion
doctor
you
seem
very
fond
of
belittling
our
abilities
personally
i
think
that
we
shall
be
able
to
attain
our
objectives
within
a
few
weeks
certainly
long
before
you
can
possibly
return
from
such
an
extended
trip
as
you
have
in
mind
and
since
you
are
so
fond
of
frankness
i
will
say
that
i
think
that
seaton
has
you
buffaloed
as
you
call
it
of
these
wonderful
osnomian
things
i
am
assured
by
competent
authorities
are
scientifically
impossible
and
i
think
that
the
other
exists
only
in
your
own
imagination
seaton
was
lucky
in
that
the
airplane
bomb
was
defective
and
exploded
prematurely
and
your
got
hot
because
of
your
injudicious
speed
through
the
atmosphere
we
shall
have
everything
settled
by
the
time
you
get
back
if
you
have
i
make
you
a
present
of
the
controlling
interest
in
steel
and
buy
myself
a
chair
in
some
home
for
old
women
your
ignorance
and
unwillingness
to
believe
any
new
idea
do
not
change
the
facts
in
any
particular
even
before
they
went
to
osnome
seaton
was
hard
to
get
as
you
found
out
on
that
trip
he
learned
so
much
new
stuff
that
it
is
now
impossible
to
kill
him
by
any
ordinary
means
you
should
realize
that
fact
when
he
kills
every
gangster
you
send
against
him
at
all
events
be
very
careful
not
to
kill
his
wife
in
any
of
your
attacks
even
by
accident
until
after
you
have
killed
him
such
an
event
would
be
regrettable
certainly
in
that
it
would
remove
all
possibility
of
the
abduction
it
would
remove
more
than
that
remember
the
explosion
in
our
laboratory
that
blew
an
entire
mountain
into
impalpable
dust
draw
in
your
mind
a
nice
vivid
picture
of
one
ten
times
the
size
in
each
of
our
plants
and
in
this
building
i
know
that
you
are
fool
enough
to
go
ahead
with
your
own
ideas
in
spite
of
everything
i
said
and
since
i
do
not
yet
actually
control
steel
i
ca
forbid
you
to
officially
but
you
should
know
that
i
know
what
i
talking
about
and
i
say
again
that
you
going
to
make
an
utter
fool
of
yourself
just
because
you
believe
anything
possible
that
has
been
done
every
day
for
a
hundred
years
i
wish
that
i
could
make
you
understand
that
seaton
and
crane
have
got
something
that
we
have
but
for
the
good
of
our
plants
and
incidentally
for
your
own
please
remember
one
thing
anyway
for
if
you
forget
it
we
wo
have
a
plant
left
and
you
personally
will
be
blown
into
a
fine
red
mist
whatever
you
start
kill
seaton
first
and
be
absolutely
certain
that
he
is
definitely
completely
finally
and
totally
dead
before
you
touch
one
of
dorothy
seaton
red
hairs
as
long
as
you
only
attack
him
personally
he
wo
do
anything
but
kill
every
man
you
send
against
him
if
you
kill
her
while
he
still
alive
though
blooie
and
the
saturnine
scientist
waved
both
hands
in
an
expressive
pantomime
of
wholesale
destruction
probably
you
are
right
in
that
brookings
paled
slightly
yes
seaton
would
do
just
that
we
shall
be
very
careful
until
after
we
succeed
in
removing
him
do
worry
you
wo
succeed
i
shall
attend
to
that
detail
myself
as
soon
as
i
get
back
seaton
and
crane
and
their
families
the
directors
and
employees
of
their
plants
the
banks
that
by
any
possibility
may
harbor
their
notes
or
solutions
in
short
every
person
and
everything
standing
between
me
and
a
monopoly
of
all
shall
disappear
that
is
a
terrible
program
doctor
would
the
late
perkins
plan
of
an
abduction
such
as
i
have
in
mind
be
better
safer
and
quicker
yes
except
for
the
fact
that
it
will
not
work
i
talked
until
blue
in
the
face
i
proved
to
you
over
and
over
that
you
ca
abduct
her
now
without
first
killing
him
and
that
you
ca
even
touch
him
my
plan
is
the
only
one
that
will
work
seaton
is
the
only
one
who
learned
anything
i
learned
a
lot
myself
i
learned
one
thing
in
particular
only
four
other
inhabitants
of
either
earth
or
osnome
ever
had
even
an
inkling
of
it
and
they
died
with
their
brains
disintegrated
beyond
reading
that
thing
is
my
ace
in
the
hole
going
after
it
when
i
get
it
and
not
until
then
will
i
be
ready
to
take
the
offensive
you
intend
starting
open
war
upon
your
return
the
war
started
when
i
tried
to
pick
off
the
women
with
my
attractor
that
is
why
i
am
leaving
at
midnight
he
always
goes
to
bed
at
and
i
will
be
out
of
range
of
his
before
he
wakes
up
seaton
and
i
understand
each
other
perfectly
we
both
know
that
the
next
time
we
meet
one
of
us
is
going
to
be
resolved
into
his
component
atoms
perhaps
into
electrons
he
does
know
that
he
going
to
be
the
one
but
i
do
my
final
word
to
you
is
to
lay
off
if
you
do
you
and
your
authorities
are
going
to
learn
a
lot
you
do
not
care
to
inform
me
more
fully
as
to
your
destination
or
your
plans
i
do
not
goodbye

martin
crane
reclined
in
a
massive
chair
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
lightly
touching
those
of
his
left
listening
attentively
richard
seaton
strode
up
and
down
the
room
before
his
friend
his
unruly
brown
hair
on
end
speaking
savagely
between
teeth
clenched
upon
the
stem
of
his
reeking
battered
briar
brandishing
a
sheaf
of
papers
mart
we
stuck
stopped
dead
if
my
head
was
made
of
solid
blue
mush
i
have
had
a
way
figured
out
of
this
thing
before
now
but
i
ca
with
that
zone
of
force
the
skylark
would
have
everything
imaginable
without
it
we
exactly
where
we
were
before
that
zone
is
immense
man
terrific
its
possibilities
are
unthinkable
and
i
so
cussed
dumb
that
i
ca
find
out
how
to
use
it
intelligently
ca
use
it
at
all
for
that
matter
by
its
very
nature
it
is
impenetrable
to
any
form
of
matter
however
applied
and
this
calc
here
slapping
viciously
the
sheaf
of
papers
containing
his
calculations
shows
that
it
must
also
be
opaque
to
any
wave
whatever
propagated
through
air
or
through
ether
clear
down
to
cosmic
rays
behind
it
we
would
be
blind
and
helpless
so
we
ca
use
it
at
all
it
drives
me
frantic
think
of
a
barrier
of
pure
force
impalpable
immaterial
and
exerted
along
a
geometrical
surface
of
no
thickness
whatever
and
yet
actual
enough
to
stop
even
a
millikan
ray
that
travels
a
hundred
thousand
and
then
goes
through
feet
of
solid
lead
just
like
it
was
so
much
vacuum
that
what
we
up
against
however
i
going
to
try
out
that
model
mart
right
now
come
on
guy
snap
into
it
let
get
busy
you
are
getting
idiotic
again
dick
crane
rejoined
calmly
without
moving
you
know
even
better
than
i
do
that
you
are
playing
with
the
most
concentrated
essence
of
energy
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
that
zone
of
force
probably
can
be
generated
probably
nothing
barked
seaton
it
just
as
evident
a
fact
as
that
stool
kicking
the
unoffending
bit
of
furniture
across
the
room
as
he
spoke
if
let
me
shown
it
to
you
yesterday
undoubtedly
then
grant
that
it
is
impenetrable
to
all
matter
and
to
all
known
waves
suppose
that
it
should
prove
impenetrable
also
to
gravitation
and
to
magnetism
those
phenomena
probably
depend
upon
the
ether
but
we
know
nothing
fundamental
of
their
nature
nor
of
that
of
the
ether
therefore
your
calculations
comprehensive
though
they
are
can
not
predict
the
effect
upon
them
of
your
zone
of
force
suppose
that
that
zone
actually
does
set
up
a
barrier
in
the
ether
so
that
it
nullifies
gravitation
magnetism
and
all
allied
phenomena
so
that
the
the
attractors
and
repellers
can
not
work
through
it
then
what
as
well
as
showing
me
the
zone
of
force
you
might
well
have
shown
me
yourself
flying
off
into
space
unable
to
use
your
power
and
helpless
if
you
released
the
zone
no
we
must
know
more
of
the
fundamentals
before
you
try
even
a
experiment
oh
bugs
you
carrying
caution
to
extremes
mart
what
can
happen
even
if
gravitation
should
be
nullified
i
would
rise
only
slowly
heading
south
the
angle
of
our
latitude
that
degrees
away
from
the
perpendicular
i
could
shoot
off
on
a
tangent
as
some
of
these
have
been
claiming
inertia
would
make
me
keep
pace
approximately
with
the
earth
in
its
rotation
i
would
rise
slowly
only
as
fast
as
the
tangent
departs
from
the
curvature
of
the
earth
surface
i
have
figured
out
how
fast
that
is
but
it
must
be
pretty
slow
pretty
slow
crane
smiled
figure
it
out
all
right
but
i
bet
it
slower
than
the
rise
of
a
toy
balloon
seaton
threw
down
the
papers
and
picked
up
his
a
trigonometrical
duplex
you
concede
that
it
is
allowable
to
neglect
the
radial
component
of
the
orbital
velocity
of
the
earth
for
a
first
approximation
wo
you
or
shall
i
figure
that
in
too
you
may
ignore
that
factor
all
right
let
see
radius
of
rotation
here
in
washington
would
be
cosine
latitude
times
equatorial
radius
approximately
call
it
hundred
miles
angular
velocity
fifteen
degrees
an
hour
i
want
secant
fifteen
less
one
times
hundred
right
secant
equals
one
over
cosine
one
point
oh
three
five
then
point
oh
three
five
times
hundred
hundred
and
twelve
miles
first
hour
velocity
constant
with
respect
to
sun
accelerated
respecting
point
of
departure
ouch
you
win
mart
i
kinda
step
out
well
how
about
this
then
i
put
on
a
vacuum
suit
and
carry
rations
harness
outside
with
the
same
equipment
i
used
in
the
test
flights
before
we
built
i
the
new
stuff
and
a
coil
then
throw
on
the
zone
and
see
what
happens
there
ca
be
any
jar
in
taking
off
and
with
that
outfit
i
can
get
back
if
i
go
clear
to
jupiter
crane
sat
in
silence
his
keen
mind
considering
every
aspect
of
the
motions
possible
of
velocity
of
acceleration
of
inertia
he
already
knew
well
seaton
resourcefulness
in
crises
and
his
physical
and
mental
strength
as
far
as
i
can
see
that
might
be
safe
he
admitted
finally
and
we
really
should
know
something
about
it
besides
the
theory
fine
mart
let
get
busy
i
be
ready
in
five
minutes
yell
for
the
girls
will
you
they
break
us
off
at
the
ankles
if
we
pull
anything
new
without
letting
them
in
on
it
a
few
minutes
later
the
girls
strolled
out
into
crane
field
arms
around
each
other
dorothy
seaton
her
gorgeous
auburn
hair
framing
violet
eyes
and
vivid
coloring
margaret
crane
it
cold
dorothy
shivered
wrapping
her
coat
more
closely
about
her
this
must
be
the
coldest
day
washington
has
seen
for
years
it
is
cold
margaret
agreed
i
wonder
what
they
are
going
to
do
out
here
this
kind
of
weather
as
she
spoke
the
two
men
stepped
out
of
the
testing
shed
the
huge
structure
that
housed
their
skylark
ii
seaton
waddled
clumsily
wearing
as
he
did
a
crane
which
built
of
fur
canvas
metal
and
transparent
silica
braced
by
steel
netting
and
equipped
with
and
heaters
rendered
its
wearer
independent
of
outside
conditions
of
temperature
and
pressure
outside
this
suit
he
wore
a
heavy
harness
of
leather
buckled
about
his
body
shoulders
and
legs
attached
to
which
were
numerous
knobs
switches
dials
bakelite
cases
and
other
pieces
of
apparatus
carried
by
a
strong
aluminum
framework
in
turn
supported
by
the
harness
the
universal
bearing
of
a
small
rose
directly
above
his
helmet
what
do
you
think
you
going
to
do
in
that
thing
dickie
dorothy
called
then
knowing
that
he
could
not
hear
her
voice
she
turned
to
crane
what
are
you
letting
that
precious
husband
of
mine
do
now
martin
he
looks
as
though
he
were
up
to
something
while
she
was
speaking
seaton
had
snapped
the
release
of
his
face
plate
nothing
much
dottie
just
going
to
show
the
zone
of
force
mart
would
let
me
turn
it
on
unless
i
got
all
cocked
and
primed
for
a
year
journey
into
space
dot
what
is
that
zone
of
force
anyway
asked
margaret
oh
it
something
dick
got
into
his
head
during
that
awful
fight
they
had
on
osnome
he
has
thought
of
anything
else
since
we
got
back
you
know
how
the
attractors
and
repellers
work
well
he
found
out
something
funny
about
the
way
everything
acted
while
the
mardonalians
were
bombarding
them
with
a
certain
kind
of
a
he
finally
figured
out
the
exact
ray
that
did
it
and
found
out
that
if
it
is
made
strongly
enough
it
acts
as
if
a
repeller
and
attractor
were
working
together
only
so
much
stronger
that
nothing
can
get
through
the
boundary
either
way
in
fact
it
so
strong
that
it
cuts
anything
in
two
that
in
the
way
and
the
funny
thing
is
that
there
nothing
there
at
all
really
but
dick
says
that
the
forces
meeting
there
or
something
make
it
act
as
though
something
really
important
were
there
see
assented
margaret
doubtfully
just
as
crane
finished
the
final
adjustments
and
moved
toward
them
a
safe
distance
away
from
seaton
he
turned
and
waved
his
hand
instantly
seaton
disappeared
from
view
and
around
the
place
where
he
had
stood
there
appeared
a
shimmering
globe
some
twenty
feet
in
diameter
a
globe
apparently
a
perfect
spherical
mirror
which
darted
upward
and
toward
the
south
after
a
moment
the
globe
disappeared
and
seaton
was
again
seen
he
was
now
standing
upon
a
hemispherical
mass
of
earth
he
darted
back
toward
the
group
upon
the
ground
while
the
mass
of
earth
fell
with
a
crash
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
high
above
their
heads
the
mirror
again
encompassed
seaton
and
again
shot
upward
and
southward
five
times
this
maneuver
was
repeated
before
seaton
came
down
landing
easily
in
front
of
them
and
opening
his
helmet
it
just
what
we
thought
it
was
only
worse
he
reported
tersely
ca
do
a
thing
with
it
gravitation
wo
work
through
it
bars
wo
nothing
will
and
dark
folks
you
ai
never
seen
no
darkness
nor
heard
no
silence
it
scared
me
stiff
poor
little
boy
afraid
of
the
dark
exclaimed
dorothy
we
saw
absolute
blackness
in
space
not
like
this
you
did
i
just
saw
absolute
darkness
and
heard
absolute
silence
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
never
imagined
anything
like
it
come
on
up
with
me
and
i
show
it
to
you
no
you
wo
his
wife
shrieked
as
she
retreated
toward
crane
some
other
time
perhaps
seaton
removed
the
harness
and
glanced
at
the
spot
from
which
he
had
taken
off
where
now
appeared
a
hemispherical
hole
in
the
ground
let
see
what
kind
of
tracks
i
left
mart
and
the
two
men
bent
over
the
depression
they
saw
with
astonishment
that
the
cut
surface
was
perfectly
smooth
with
not
even
the
slightest
roughness
or
irregularity
visible
even
the
smallest
loose
grains
of
sand
had
been
sheared
in
two
along
a
mathematically
exact
hemispherical
surface
by
the
inconceivable
force
of
the
disintegrating
copper
bar
well
that
sure
wins
the
an
alarm
bell
sounded
without
a
glance
around
seaton
seized
dorothy
and
leaped
into
the
testing
shed
dropping
her
unceremoniously
to
the
floor
he
stared
through
the
telescope
sight
of
an
enormous
which
had
automatically
aligned
itself
upon
the
distant
point
of
liberation
of
energy
which
had
caused
the
alarm
to
sound
one
hand
upon
the
switch
his
face
was
hard
and
merciless
as
he
waited
to
make
sure
of
the
identity
of
the
approaching
before
he
released
the
frightful
power
of
his
generator
upon
it
i
been
expecting
duquesne
to
try
it
again
he
gritted
striving
to
make
out
the
visitor
yet
more
than
two
hundred
miles
distant
he
out
to
get
you
dot
and
this
time
i
not
just
going
to
warm
him
up
and
scare
him
away
as
i
did
last
time
this
time
that
misguided
going
to
get
frizzled
right
i
ca
locate
him
with
this
small
telescope
mart
line
him
up
in
the
big
one
and
give
me
the
word
will
you
i
see
him
dick
but
it
is
not
duquesne
ship
it
is
built
of
transparent
arenak
like
the
even
though
it
seems
impossible
i
believe
it
is
the
maybe
so
and
again
maybe
duquesne
built
it
or
stole
it
on
second
thought
though
i
do
believe
that
duquesne
would
be
fool
enough
to
tackle
us
again
in
the
same
way
but
i
taking
no
chances
it
is
the
i
can
see
dunark
and
sitar
myself
now
the
transparent
vessel
soon
neared
the
field
and
the
four
terrestrials
walked
out
to
greet
their
osnomian
friends
through
the
arenak
walls
they
recognized
dunark
kofedix
of
kondal
at
the
controls
and
saw
sitar
his
beautiful
young
queen
lying
in
one
of
the
seats
near
the
wall
she
attempted
a
friendly
greeting
but
her
face
was
strained
as
though
she
were
laboring
under
a
burden
too
great
for
her
to
bear
as
they
watched
dunark
slipped
a
helmet
over
his
head
and
one
over
sitar
pressed
a
button
to
open
one
of
the
doors
and
supported
her
toward
the
opening
they
must
come
out
dick
exclaimed
dorothy
in
dismay
freeze
to
death
in
five
minutes
without
any
clothes
on
yes
and
sitar
ca
stand
up
under
our
gravitation
either
i
doubt
if
dunark
can
for
long
and
seaton
dashed
toward
the
vessel
motioning
the
visitor
back
but
misunderstanding
the
signal
dunark
came
on
as
he
clambered
heavily
through
the
door
he
staggered
as
though
under
an
enormous
weight
and
sitar
collapsed
upon
the
frozen
ground
trying
to
help
her
over
her
dunark
struggled
his
green
skin
paling
to
a
yellowish
tinge
at
the
touch
of
the
bitter
and
unexpected
cold
seaton
leaped
forward
and
gathered
sitar
up
in
his
mighty
arms
as
though
she
were
a
child
illustration
to
help
her
half
kneeling
over
her
dunark
struggled
his
green
skin
paling
to
a
yellowish
tinge
at
the
touch
of
the
bitter
and
unexpected
help
dunark
back
in
mart
he
directed
crisply
hop
in
girls
got
to
take
these
folks
back
up
where
they
can
live
seaton
shut
the
door
and
as
everyone
lay
flat
in
the
seats
crane
who
had
taken
the
controls
applied
one
notch
of
power
and
the
huge
vessel
leaped
upward
miles
of
altitude
were
gained
before
crane
brought
the
cruiser
to
a
stop
and
locked
her
in
place
with
an
anchoring
attractor
there
he
remarked
calmly
gravitation
here
is
approximately
the
same
as
it
is
upon
osnome
yes
put
in
seaton
standing
up
and
shedding
clothing
in
all
directions
and
i
rise
to
remark
that
we
better
undress
as
far
as
the
law
allows
perhaps
farther
i
never
did
like
osnomian
ideas
of
comfortable
warmth
but
we
can
endure
it
by
peeling
down
to
bedrock
sitar
jumped
up
happily
completely
restored
and
the
three
women
threw
their
arms
around
each
other
what
a
horrible
terrible
frightful
world
exclaimed
sitar
her
eyes
widening
as
she
thought
of
her
first
experience
with
our
earth
much
as
i
love
you
i
shall
never
dare
try
to
visit
you
again
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
why
you
terrestrials
wear
what
you
call
nor
why
you
are
so
terribly
brutally
strong
now
i
really
know
i
will
feel
the
utterly
cold
and
savage
embrace
of
that
awful
earth
of
yours
as
long
as
i
live
oh
it
not
so
bad
sitar
seaton
who
was
shaking
both
of
hands
vigorously
assured
her
over
his
shoulder
all
depends
on
where
you
were
raised
we
like
it
that
way
and
osnome
gives
us
the
pip
but
you
poor
fish
turning
again
to
dunark
with
all
my
brains
inside
your
skull
you
should
have
known
what
you
were
letting
yourself
in
for
that
true
after
a
fashion
dunark
admitted
but
your
brain
told
me
that
washington
was
if
i
have
thought
to
recalculate
your
actual
fahrenheit
degrees
into
our
loro
but
that
figures
only
and
while
very
cold
we
could
have
endured
it
wait
a
minute
i
getting
it
you
have
what
you
call
this
then
must
be
your
right
right
the
first
time
that
the
way
your
brain
works
behind
my
pan
too
i
could
figure
anything
out
all
right
after
it
happened
but
hardly
ever
beforehand
so
i
guess
i
ca
blame
you
much
at
that
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
you
get
here
it
would
take
more
than
my
brains
you
ca
see
our
sun
from
anywhere
near
osnome
even
if
you
knew
exactly
where
to
look
for
it
easy
remember
those
wrecked
instruments
you
threw
out
of
when
we
built
having
every
minute
detail
of
the
configuration
of
seaton
brain
engraved
upon
his
own
dunark
spoke
english
in
seaton
own
characteristic
careless
fashion
only
when
thinking
deeply
or
discussing
abstruse
matter
did
seaton
employ
the
carefully
selected
and
precise
phrasing
which
he
knew
so
well
how
to
use
well
none
of
them
was
beyond
repair
and
the
juice
was
still
on
most
of
them
one
was
an
bearing
on
the
earth
we
simply
fixed
the
bearings
put
on
some
minor
improvements
and
here
we
are
let
us
all
sit
down
and
be
comfortable
he
continued
changing
into
the
kondalian
tongue
without
a
break
and
i
will
explain
why
we
have
come
we
are
in
most
desperate
need
of
two
things
which
you
alone
can
supply
salt
and
that
strange
metal
salt
i
know
you
have
in
great
abundance
but
i
know
that
you
have
very
little
of
the
metal
you
have
only
the
one
compass
upon
that
planet
that
all
one
is
all
we
set
on
it
however
we
got
close
to
half
a
ton
of
the
metal
on
hand
you
can
have
all
you
want
even
if
i
took
it
all
which
i
would
not
like
to
do
that
would
be
less
than
half
enough
we
must
have
at
least
one
of
your
tons
and
two
tons
would
be
better
two
tons
holy
cat
are
you
going
to
plate
a
fleet
of
battle
cruisers
more
than
that
we
must
plate
an
area
of
copper
of
some
ten
thousand
square
miles
in
fact
the
very
life
of
our
entire
race
depends
upon
it
it
this
way
he
continued
as
the
four
stared
at
him
in
wonder
shortly
after
you
left
osnome
we
were
invaded
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
third
planet
of
our
fourteenth
sun
luckily
for
us
they
landed
upon
mardonale
and
in
less
than
two
days
there
was
not
a
single
osnomian
left
alive
upon
that
half
of
the
planet
they
wiped
out
our
grand
fleet
in
one
brief
engagement
and
it
was
only
the
and
a
few
more
like
her
that
enabled
us
to
keep
them
from
crossing
the
ocean
even
with
our
full
force
of
these
vessels
we
can
not
defeat
them
our
regular
kondalian
weapons
were
useless
we
shot
explosive
copper
charges
against
them
of
such
size
as
to
cause
earthquakes
all
over
osnome
without
seriously
crippling
their
defenses
their
offensive
weapons
are
almost
irresistible
they
have
generators
that
burn
arenak
as
though
it
were
so
much
paper
and
a
series
of
deadly
frequencies
against
which
only
a
ray
screen
is
effective
and
even
that
does
not
stand
up
long
how
come
you
lasted
till
now
then
asked
seaton
they
have
nothing
like
the
and
no
knowledge
of
energy
therefore
their
are
of
the
rocket
type
and
for
that
reason
they
can
cross
only
at
the
exact
time
of
conjunction
or
whatever
you
call
it
no
not
conjunction
exactly
either
since
the
two
planets
do
not
revolve
around
the
same
sun
but
when
they
are
closest
together
our
solar
system
is
so
complex
you
know
that
unless
the
trips
are
timed
exactly
to
the
hour
the
vessels
will
not
be
able
to
land
upon
osnome
but
will
be
drawn
aside
and
be
lost
if
not
actually
drawn
into
the
vast
central
sun
although
it
may
not
have
occurred
to
you
a
little
reflection
will
show
that
the
inhabitants
of
all
the
central
planets
such
as
osnome
must
perforce
be
absolutely
ignorant
of
astronomy
and
of
all
the
wonders
of
outer
space
before
your
coming
we
knew
nothing
beyond
our
own
solar
system
and
very
little
of
that
we
knew
of
the
existence
of
only
such
of
the
closest
planets
as
were
brilliant
enough
to
be
seen
in
our
continuous
sunlight
and
they
were
few
immediately
after
your
coming
i
gave
your
knowledge
of
astronomy
to
a
group
of
our
foremost
physicists
and
mathematicians
and
they
have
been
working
ceaselessly
from
close
enough
so
that
observations
could
be
recalculated
to
osnome
and
yet
far
enough
away
to
afford
perfect
as
you
call
it
but
i
do
know
any
more
about
astronomy
than
a
pig
does
about
sunday
protested
seaton
your
knowledge
of
details
is
of
course
incomplete
conceded
dunark
but
the
detailed
knowledge
of
the
best
of
your
earthly
astronomers
would
not
help
us
a
great
deal
since
we
are
so
far
removed
from
you
in
space
you
however
have
a
very
clear
and
solid
knowledge
of
the
fundamentals
of
the
science
and
that
is
what
we
need
above
all
things
well
maybe
you
right
at
that
i
do
know
the
general
theory
of
the
motions
and
i
studied
some
celestial
mechanics
i
awfully
weak
on
advanced
theory
though
as
you
find
out
when
you
get
that
far
perhaps
but
since
our
enemies
have
no
knowledge
of
astronomy
whatever
it
is
not
surprising
that
their
can
be
launched
only
at
one
particularly
favorable
time
for
there
are
many
planets
and
satellites
of
which
they
can
know
nothing
to
throw
their
vessels
off
the
course
some
material
essential
to
the
operation
of
their
war
machinery
apparently
must
come
from
their
own
planet
for
they
have
ceased
attacking
have
dug
in
and
are
simply
holding
their
ground
it
may
be
that
they
had
not
anticipated
as
much
resistance
as
we
could
offer
with
and
energy
at
any
rate
they
have
apparently
saved
enough
of
that
material
to
enable
them
to
hold
out
until
the
next
conjunction
i
can
not
think
of
a
better
word
for
it
shall
occur
our
forces
are
attacking
constantly
with
all
the
armament
at
our
command
but
it
is
certain
that
if
the
next
conjunction
is
allowed
to
occur
it
means
the
end
of
the
entire
kondalian
nation
what
mean
the
next
conjunction
is
to
occur
interjected
seaton
nobody
can
stop
it
i
am
stopping
it
dunark
stated
quietly
grim
purpose
in
every
lineament
that
conjunction
shall
never
occur
that
is
why
i
must
have
the
vast
quantities
of
salt
and
we
are
building
abutments
of
arenak
upon
the
first
satellite
of
our
seventh
planet
and
upon
our
sixth
planet
itself
we
shall
cover
them
with
plated
active
copper
and
install
chronometers
to
throw
the
switches
at
precisely
the
right
moment
we
have
calculated
the
exact
times
places
and
magnitudes
of
the
forces
to
be
used
we
shall
throw
the
sixth
planet
some
distance
out
of
its
orbit
and
force
the
first
satellite
of
the
seventh
planet
clear
out
of
that
planet
influence
the
two
bodies
whose
motions
we
have
thus
changed
will
collide
in
such
a
way
that
the
resultant
body
will
meet
the
planet
of
our
enemies
in
collision
long
before
the
next
conjunction
the
two
bodies
will
be
of
almost
equal
masses
and
will
have
opposite
and
approximately
equal
velocities
hence
the
resultant
fused
or
gaseous
mass
will
be
practically
without
velocity
and
will
fall
directly
into
the
fourteenth
sun
would
it
be
easier
to
destroy
it
with
an
explosive
copper
bomb
easier
yes
but
much
more
dangerous
to
the
rest
of
our
solar
system
we
can
not
calculate
exactly
the
effect
of
the
collisions
we
are
planning
but
it
is
almost
certain
that
an
explosion
of
sufficient
violence
to
destroy
all
life
upon
the
planet
would
disturb
its
motion
sufficiently
to
endanger
the
entire
system
the
way
we
have
in
mind
will
simply
allow
the
planet
and
one
satellite
to
drop
out
quietly
the
other
planets
of
the
same
sun
will
soon
adjust
themselves
to
the
new
conditions
and
the
system
at
large
will
be
practically
unaffected
at
least
so
we
believe
seaton
eyes
narrowed
as
his
thoughts
turned
to
the
quantities
of
copper
and
x
required
and
to
the
engineering
features
of
the
project
crane
first
thought
was
of
the
mathematics
involved
in
a
computation
of
that
magnitude
and
character
dorothy
quick
reaction
was
one
of
pure
horror
he
ca
dick
he
must
it
would
be
too
ghastly
outrageous
it
unthinkable
it
it
it
simply
too
horrible
her
violet
eyes
flamed
and
margaret
joined
in
that
would
be
awful
martin
think
of
the
destruction
of
a
whole
planet
of
an
entire
world
with
all
its
inhabitants
it
makes
me
shudder
even
to
think
of
it
dunark
leaped
to
his
feet
ablaze
but
before
he
could
say
a
word
seaton
silenced
him
shut
up
dunark
pipe
down
do
say
anything
you
be
sorry
for
let
tell
close
your
mouth
i
tell
you
as
dunark
still
tried
to
get
a
word
in
i
tell
you
i
tell
and
when
i
tell
they
stay
told
now
listen
you
two
girls
you
going
off
and
both
full
of
little
red
ants
what
do
you
think
dunark
is
up
against
sherman
chirped
it
when
he
described
war
and
this
is
a
real
a
brand
totally
unknown
on
our
earth
it
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
to
destroy
a
population
the
only
question
is
which
population
is
to
be
destroyed
one
of
them
got
to
go
remember
those
folks
go
into
a
war
thoroughly
and
there
is
a
thought
even
remotely
resembling
our
conception
of
mercy
in
any
of
their
minds
on
either
side
if
plans
go
through
the
enemy
nation
will
be
wiped
out
that
is
horrible
of
course
but
on
the
other
hand
if
we
block
him
off
from
salt
and
the
entire
kondalian
nation
will
be
destroyed
just
as
thoroughly
and
efficiently
and
even
more
horribly
not
one
man
woman
or
child
would
be
spared
which
nation
do
you
want
saved
play
that
over
a
couple
of
times
on
your
adding
machine
dot
and
let
me
know
what
you
get
dorothy
taken
aback
opened
and
closed
her
mouth
twice
before
she
found
her
voice
but
dick
they
could
possibly
would
they
kill
them
all
dick
surely
they
would
they
surely
they
would
and
could
they
do
it
good
technique
in
those
parts
of
the
galaxy
dunark
has
just
told
us
of
how
they
killed
every
member
of
the
entire
race
of
mardonalians
in
forty
hours
kondal
would
go
the
same
way
do
kid
yourself
dimples
do

war
up
there
is
species
of
pink
tea
believe
me
half
of
my
brain
has
been
through
thirty
years
of
osnomian
warfare
and
i
know
precisely
what
talking
about
let
take
a
vote
personally
i
in
favor
of
osnome
mart
osnome
dottie
peggy
both
remained
silent
for
some
time
then
dorothy
turned
to
margaret
you
tell
him
peggy
we
both
feel
the
same
way
dick
you
know
that
we
would
want
the
kondalians
destroyed
but
the
other
is
so
such
a
well
such
an
utter
is
there
some
other
way
out
i
afraid
not
but
if
there
is
any
other
possible
way
out
i
do
my
da
to
help
find
it
he
promised
the
ayes
have
it
dunark
we
skip
over
to
that
planet
and
load
you
up
dunark
grasped
seaton
hand
thanks
dick
he
said
simply
but
before
you
help
me
farther
and
lest
i
might
be
in
some
degree
sailing
under
false
colors
i
must
tell
you
that
wearer
of
the
seven
disks
though
you
are
overlord
of
osnome
though
you
are
my
brain
brother
though
you
are
had
you
decided
against
me
nothing
but
my
death
could
have
kept
me
away
from
that
salt
and
your
compass
why
sure
assented
seaton
in
surprise
why
not
fair
enough
anybody
would
do
the
same
do
let
that
bother
you
how
is
your
supply
of
platinum
asked
dunark
mighty
low
we
had
about
decided
to
hop
over
there
after
some
i
want
some
of
your
textbooks
on
electricity
and
so
on
too
i
see
you
brought
a
load
of
platinum
with
you
yes
a
few
hundred
tons
we
also
brought
along
an
assortment
of
books
i
knew
you
would
be
interested
in
a
box
of
radium
a
few
small
bags
of
gems
of
various
kinds
and
some
of
our
fabrics
sitar
thought
your
karfediro
would
like
to
have
while
we
are
here
i
would
like
to
get
some
books
on
chemistry
and
some
other
things
we
get
you
the
congressional
library
if
you
want
it
and
anything
else
you
think
you
like
well
gang
let
go
places
and
do
things
what
to
do
mart
we
had
better
drop
back
to
earth
have
the
laborers
unload
the
platinum
and
load
on
the
salt
books
and
other
things
then
both
ships
will
go
to
the
planet
as
we
will
each
want
compasses
on
it
for
future
use
while
we
are
loading
i
should
like
to
begin
remodeling
our
instruments
to
make
them
something
like
these
with
permission
these
instruments
are
wonders
dick
vastly
ahead
of
anything
i
have
ever
seen
come
and
look
at
them
if
you
want
to
see
something
really
beautiful
coming
up
but
say
mart
while
i
think
of
it
we
must
forget
to
install
a
apparatus
on
this
boat
too
even
though
we
ca
use
it
intelligently
it
certainly
would
be
a
winner
as
a
defense
we
could
hurt
anybody
through
it
of
course
but
if
we
should
happen
to
be
getting
licked
anywhere
all
we
have
to
do
would
be
to
wrap
ourselves
up
in
it
they
could
touch
us
nothing
in
the
ether
spectrum
is
corkscrewy
enough
to
get
through
it
that
the
second
idea
you
had
since
i
known
you
dicky
dorothy
smiled
at
crane
do
you
think
he
should
be
allowed
to
run
at
large
martin
that
is
a
real
idea
we
may
need
it
you
never
can
tell
even
if
we
never
find
any
other
use
for
the
zone
of
force
that
one
is
amply
sufficient
to
justify
its
installation
yes
it
would
be
for
you
and
i
getting
to
be
a
regular
simon
myself
since
they
opened
up
on
us
what
about
those
instruments
the
three
men
gathered
around
the
and
dunark
explained
the
changes
he
had
made
and
to
such
men
as
seaton
and
crane
it
was
soon
evident
that
they
were
examining
an
installation
embodying
sheer
perfection
of
instrumental
control
a
system
which
only
those
wonder
the
osnomians
could
have
devised
the
new
were
housed
in
arenak
cases
after
setting
and
the
housings
were
then
exhausted
to
the
highest
attainable
vacuum
oscillation
was
set
up
by
means
of
one
carefully
standardized
electrical
impulse
instead
of
by
the
clumsy
seaton
had
used
the
bearings
built
of
arenak
and
osnomian
jewels
were
as
strong
as
the
axles
of
a
truck
and
yet
were
almost
perfectly
frictionless
i
like
them
myself
admitted
dunark
without
a
load
the
needles
will
rotate
freely
more
than
a
thousand
hours
on
the
primary
impulse
as
against
a
few
minutes
in
the
old
type
and
under
load
they
are
many
thousands
of
times
as
sensitive
you
a
blinding
flash
and
a
deafening
report
ace
declared
seaton
enthusiastically
that
compass
is
as
far
ahead
of
my
model
as
the
is
ahead
of
wright
first
glider
the
other
instruments
were
no
less
noteworthy
dunark
had
adopted
the
perkins
telephone
system
but
had
improved
it
until
it
was
scarcely
recognized
and
had
made
it
capable
of
almost
unlimited
range
even
the
guns
heavy
mounted
in
spherical
bearings
in
the
walls
were
aimed
and
fired
by
remote
control
from
the
board
he
had
devised
full
automatic
steering
controls
and
meters
and
recorders
for
acceleration
velocity
distance
and
he
had
perfected
a
system
of
periscopic
vision
which
enabled
the
pilot
to
see
the
entire
outside
surfaces
of
the
shell
and
to
look
toward
any
point
of
the
heavens
without
interference
this
kind
of
takes
my
eye
too
prince
seaton
said
as
he
seated
himself
swung
a
large
concave
disk
in
front
of
him
and
experimented
with
levers
and
dials
you
certainly
ca
call
this
thing
a
periscope
it
no
more
a
periscope
than
i
am
a
polyp
when
you
look
through
this
plate
it
better
than
looking
out
of
a
window
it
subtends
more
than
the
angle
of
vision
so
that
you
ca
see
anything
but
i
thought
for
a
second
i
was
going
to
fall
out
what
do
you
call
dunark
kraloto
that
would
be
in
english
or
rather
call
it
that
a
good
word
mart
take
a
look
if
you
want
to
see
a
set
of
perfect
lenses
and
prisms
crane
looked
into
the
visiplate
and
gasped
the
vessel
had
disappeared
he
was
looking
directly
down
upon
the
earth
below
him
no
trace
of
chromatic
spherical
or
astigmatic
aberration
he
reported
in
surprise
the
refracting
system
is
invisible
it
seems
as
though
nothing
intervenes
between
the
eye
and
the
object
you
perfected
all
these
things
since
we
left
osnome
dunark
you
are
in
a
class
by
yourself
i
could
not
even
copy
them
in
less
than
a
month
and
i
never
could
have
invented
them
i
did
not
do
it
alone
by
any
means
the
society
of
of
which
i
am
only
one
member
installed
and
tested
more
than
a
hundred
systems
this
one
represents
the
best
features
of
all
the
systems
tried
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
you
to
copy
them
i
brought
along
two
complete
duplicate
sets
for
the
as
well
as
a
dozen
or
so
of
the
compasses
i
thought
that
perhaps
these
particular
improvements
might
not
have
occurred
to
you
since
you
terrestrials
are
not
as
familiar
as
we
are
with
complex
instrumental
work
crane
and
seaton
spoke
together
that
was
thoughtful
of
you
dunark
and
we
appreciated
it
fully
that
puts
four
more
palms
on
your
de
ace
thanks
a
lot
say
dick
called
dorothy
from
her
seat
near
the
wall
if
going
down
to
the
ground
how
about
sitar
by
lying
down
and
not
doing
anything
and
by
staying
in
the
vessel
where
it
is
warm
she
will
be
all
right
for
the
short
time
we
must
stay
here
dunark
answered
for
his
wife
i
will
help
all
i
can
but
i
do
not
know
how
much
that
will
be
it
is
so
bad
lying
down
sitar
agreed
i
do
like
your
earth
a
bit
but
i
can
stand
it
a
little
while
anyway
i
stand
it
so
why
worry
about
it
cheered
seaton
and
as
for
you
dunark
you
pass
the
time
just
like
sitar
does
lying
down
if
you
do
much
chasing
around
down
there
where
we
live
you
apt
to
get
your
lights
and
liver
twisted
all
out
of
shape
so
you
stay
put
horizontal
we
got
men
enough
around
the
shop
to
eat
this
cargo
in
three
hours
let
alone
unload
it
while
they
unload
and
load
you
up
we
install
the
zone
apparatus
put
a
compass
on
you
put
one
of
yours
on
us
and
then
you
can
hop
back
up
here
where
you
comfortable
then
as
soon
as
we
can
get
the
ready
for
the
trip
we
jump
up
here
and
be
on
our
way
everything
clear
cut
the
rope
mart
let
the
old
bucket
drop
chapter
iii
skylark
two
sets
out
say
mart
i
just
got
conscious
it
never
occurred
to
me
until
just
now
as
dunark
left
that
i
as
good
an
as
dunark
is
the
same
one
in
fact
and
i
got
a
hunch
you
know
that
needle
on
duquesne
has
been
working
for
quite
a
while
well
i
do
believe
it
out
of
commission
at
all
i
think
he
gone
somewhere
so
far
away
that
it
ca
read
on
him
i
going
to
house
it
in
it
and
find
out
where
he
is
an
excellent
idea
he
has
even
you
worrying
and
as
for
myself
worrying
that
bird
is
simply
pulling
my
cork
i
so
scared
he
get
dottie
that
i
running
around
in
circles
and
biting
myself
in
the
small
of
the
back
he
got
a
hen
on
you
can
bet
your
shirt
on
that
what
gravels
me
is
he
aiming
at
the
girls
not
at
us
or
the
job
i
should
say
that
someone
had
aimed
at
you
fairly
accurately
judging
by
the
number
of
bullets
stopped
lately
by
that
arenak
armor
of
yours
i
wish
that
i
could
take
some
of
the
strain
but
they
are
centering
all
their
attacks
upon
you
yes
i
ca
stick
my
nose
outside
our
yard
without
somebody
throwing
lead
at
it
it
funny
too
you
more
important
to
the
than
i
am
you
should
know
why
they
are
not
afraid
of
me
while
my
spirit
is
willing
enough
it
was
your
skill
and
rapidity
with
a
pistol
that
frustrated
four
attempts
at
abduction
in
as
many
days
it
is
positively
uncanny
the
way
you
explode
into
action
with
all
my
practice
i
even
have
my
pistol
out
yesterday
until
it
was
all
over
and
besides
prescott
guards
we
had
four
policemen
with
us
detailed
to
us
because
of
the
number
of
gunmen
you
had
to
kill
before
that
it
ai
practice
so
much
mart
it
a
gift
i
always
been
fast
and
i
react
automatically
you
think
first
that
why
you
slow
those
cops
were
funny
they
did
know
what
it
was
all
about
until
it
was
all
over
all
but
calling
the
wagon
that
was
the
worst
yet
one
of
their
slugs
struck
directly
in
front
of
my
left
eye
it
was
kinda
funny
at
that
seeing
it
splash
and
i
thought
i
was
inside
a
boiler
in
a
riveting
shop
when
those
cut
loose
it
was
hectic
all
right
while
it
lasted
but
one
thing
i
tell
the
attentive
world
we
not
doing
all
the
worrying
very
few
if
any
of
the
gangsters
they
send
after
us
are
getting
back
wonder
what
they
think
when
they
shoot
at
us
and
we
do
drop
but
i
afraid
i
beginning
to
crack
mart
seaton
went
on
his
voice
becoming
grimly
earnest
i
do
like
anything
about
this
whole
mess
i
do
like
all
four
of
us
wearing
armor
all
the
time
i
do
like
living
constantly
under
guard
i
do
like
all
this
killing
and
this
constant
menace
of
losing
dorothy
if
i
let
her
out
of
my
sight
for
five
seconds
is
driving
me
mad
to
tell
you
the
real
truth
i
devilishly
afraid
that
they
figure
out
something
that
work
i
could
grab
off
two
women
or
kill
two
men
if
they
had
armor
and
guns
enough
to
stock
a
war
i
believe
that
duquesne
could
too
and
the
rest
of
that
bunch
are
imbeciles
either
by
any
means
i
wo
feel
safe
until
all
four
of
us
are
in
the
and
a
long
ways
from
here
i
sure
glad
we
pulling
out
and
i
do
intend
to
come
back
until
i
get
a
good
line
on
duquesne
he
the
bird
i
going
to
get
and
get
right
and
when
i
get
him
i
tell
the
world
he
stay
got
there
be
any
two
atoms
of
his
entire
carcass
left
in
the
same
township
i
meant
that
promise
when
i
gave
it
to
him
he
realizes
that
fully
he
knows
that
it
is
now
definitely
either
his
life
or
our
own
and
he
is
really
dangerous
when
he
took
steel
over
and
opened
war
upon
us
he
did
it
with
his
eyes
wide
open
with
his
ideas
he
must
have
a
monopoly
of
or
nothing
and
he
knows
the
only
possible
way
of
getting
it
however
you
and
i
both
know
that
he
would
not
let
either
one
of
us
live
even
though
we
surrendered
you
chirped
it
but
that
guy
going
to
find
he
started
something
unless
i
get
paralysis
of
the
intentions
well
how
about
turning
up
a
few
we
do
want
to
keep
dunark
waiting
too
long
there
is
very
little
to
do
beyond
installing
the
new
instruments
and
that
is
nearly
done
we
can
finish
pumping
out
the
compass
you
have
already
installed
every
weapon
of
offense
and
defense
known
to
either
earthly
or
osnomian
warfare
including
those
and
screens
you
moaned
so
about
not
having
during
the
battle
over
kondal
i
believe
that
we
have
on
board
every
article
for
which
either
of
us
has
been
able
to
imagine
even
the
slightest
use
yes
we
got
her
so
full
of
plunder
that
there
hardly
room
left
for
quarters
you
ai
figuring
on
taking
anybody
but
shiro
along
are
you
no
i
suppose
there
is
no
real
necessity
for
taking
even
him
but
he
wants
very
much
to
go
and
may
prove
himself
useful
i
say
he
be
useful
none
of
us
really
enjoys
polishing
brass
or
washing
dishes
and
besides
he
one
star
cook
and
an
housekeeper
the
installation
of
the
new
instruments
was
soon
completed
and
while
dorothy
and
margaret
made
preparations
for
departure
the
men
called
a
meeting
of
the
managing
directors
and
department
heads
of
the
engineers
the
chiefs
gave
brief
reports
in
turn
units
number
one
and
number
two
of
the
immense
new
central
plant
were
in
continuous
operation
number
three
was
almost
ready
to
cut
in
number
four
was
being
rushed
to
completion
number
five
was
well
under
way
the
research
laboratory
was
keeping
well
up
on
its
problems
troubles
were
less
than
had
been
anticipated
financially
it
was
a
gold
mine
with
no
expense
for
boilers
or
fuel
and
thus
with
a
relatively
small
investment
in
plant
and
a
very
small
operating
cost
they
were
selling
power
at
of
prevailing
rates
and
still
profits
were
almost
paying
for
all
new
construction
with
the
completion
of
number
five
rates
would
be
reduced
still
further
in
short
dad
everything
slick
remarked
seaton
to
vaneman
after
the
others
had
gone
yes
your
plan
of
getting
the
best
men
possible
paying
them
well
and
giving
them
complete
authority
and
sole
responsibility
has
worked
to
perfection
i
have
never
seen
an
undertaking
of
such
size
go
forward
so
smoothly
and
with
such
fine
that
the
way
we
wanted
it
we
the
directors
and
put
it
up
to
you
strictly
you
did
the
same
to
the
managers
everybody
knows
that
his
end
is
up
to
him
and
him
alone
so
he
digs
in
however
dick
while
everything
at
the
works
is
so
fine
when
is
this
other
thing
going
to
break
we
won
all
the
way
so
far
but
i
afraid
something
about
due
that
the
big
reason
i
want
to
get
dot
away
for
a
while
you
know
what
they
up
to
too
well
the
older
man
answered
dottie
or
crane
or
both
her
mother
she
is
telling
her
goodbye
now
and
i
agree
that
the
danger
here
is
greater
than
out
there
danger
out
there
with
the
old
can
fixed
the
way
she
is
now
dot
a
lot
safer
there
than
you
are
in
bed
your
house
might
fall
down
you
know
you
probably
right
son
i
know
you
and
i
know
martin
crane
together
and
in
the
i
believe
you
invincible
all
set
dick
asked
dorothy
appearing
in
the
doorway
all
set
you
got
the
dope
for
prescott
and
everybody
dad
we
may
be
back
in
six
months
or
we
may
see
something
to
investigate
and
be
gone
a
year
or
so
do
begin
to
lose
any
sleep
until
after
we
been
out
oh
say
three
years
we
make
it
a
point
to
be
back
by
then
farewells
were
said
the
party
embarked
and
shot
upward
seaton
flipped
a
phone
set
over
his
head
and
spoke
dunark
coming
out
heading
directly
for
no
better
stay
quite
a
ways
off
to
one
side
when
we
get
going
good
yes
accelerating
twenty
six
point
oh
oh
oh
yes
i
call
you
now
and
then
until
the
radio
waves
get
lost
to
check
the
course
with
you
after
that
keep
on
the
last
course
reverse
at
the
calculated
distance
and
by
the
time
we
pretty
well
slowed
down
we
feel
around
for
each
other
with
the
compasses
and
go
in
together
right
fine
so
long
in
order
that
the
two
vessels
should
keep
reasonably
close
together
it
had
been
agreed
that
each
should
be
held
at
an
acceleration
of
exactly
feet
per
second
positive
and
negative
this
figure
represented
a
compromise
between
the
gravitational
forces
of
the
two
worlds
upon
which
the
different
parties
lived
while
considerably
less
than
the
acceleration
of
gravitation
at
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
terrestrials
could
readily
accustom
themselves
to
it
and
it
was
not
enough
greater
than
that
of
osnome
to
hamper
seriously
the
activities
of
the
green
people
well
clear
of
the
earth
influence
seaton
assured
himself
that
everything
was
functioning
properly
then
stretched
to
his
full
height
wreathed
his
arms
over
his
head
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
folks
he
declared
this
is
the
first
time
i
felt
right
since
we
got
out
of
this
old
bottle
why
i
feel
so
good
a
cat
could
walk
up
to
me
and
scratch
me
right
in
the
eye
and
i
would
even
scratch
back
yowp
i
a
wild
siberian
catamount
and
this
is
my
night
to
howl
dorothy
laughed
a
gay
lilting
carol
have
i
always
told
you
he
had
cat
blood
in
him
peggy
just
like
all
tomcats
every
once
in
a
while
he
has
to
stretch
his
claws
and
yowl
but
go
ahead
dickie
i
like
it
this
is
the
first
uproar
you
made
in
weeks
i
believe
i
join
you
it
most
certainly
is
a
relief
to
get
this
load
off
our
minds
i
could
do
a
little
ladylike
yowling
myself
margaret
said
and
crane
lying
completely
at
ease
a
thin
spiral
of
smoke
curling
upward
from
his
cigarette
nodded
agreement
dick
yowling
is
quite
expressive
at
times
all
of
us
feel
the
same
way
but
some
of
us
are
unable
to
express
ourselves
quite
so
vividly
however
it
is
past
bedtime
and
we
should
organize
our
crew
shall
we
do
it
as
we
did
before
no
it
is
necessary
everything
is
automatic
the
bar
is
held
parallel
to
the
guiding
compass
and
signal
bells
ring
whenever
any
of
the
instruments
show
a
trace
of
abnormal
behavior
do
forget
that
there
is
at
least
one
meter
registering
and
recording
every
factor
of
our
flight
with
this
control
system
we
ca
get
into
any
such
jam
as
we
did
last
trip
surely
you
are
not
suggesting
that
we
run
all
night
with
no
one
at
the
controls
exactly
that
a
man
camping
at
this
board
is
painting
the
lily
and
gilding
fine
gold
awake
or
asleep
nobody
need
be
closer
to
it
than
is
necessary
to
hear
a
bell
if
one
should
ring
and
you
can
hear
them
all
over
the
ship
furthermore
i
bet
a
hat
we
wo
hear
a
signal
a
week
simply
as
added
precaution
though
i
run
lines
so
that
any
time
one
of
these
signals
lets
go
it
sounds
a
buzzer
on
the
head
of
our
bed
so
i
automatically
taking
the
night
shift
remember
mart
these
instruments
are
thousands
of
times
as
sensitive
as
the
keenest
human
senses
they
spot
trouble
long
before
we
could
even
if
we
were
looking
right
at
it
of
course
you
understand
these
instruments
much
better
than
i
do
as
yet
if
you
trust
them
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
do
the
same
goodnight
seaton
sat
down
and
dorothy
nestled
beside
him
her
head
snuggled
into
the
curve
of
his
shoulder
sleepy
heavens
no
i
could
sleep
now
lover
could
you
not
any
what
the
use
his
arm
tightened
around
her
apparently
motionless
to
its
passengers
the
cruiser
bored
serenely
on
into
space
with
velocity
there
was
not
the
faintest
sound
not
the
slightest
vibration
only
the
peculiar
violet
glow
surrounding
the
shining
copper
cylinder
in
its
massive
universal
bearing
gave
any
indication
of
the
thousands
of
kilowatts
being
generated
in
the
mighty
seaton
studied
it
thoughtfully
you
know
if
that
violet
aura
and
copper
bar
were
a
little
different
in
shade
and
tone
of
color
they
be
just
like
your
eyes
and
hair
he
remarked
finally
you
burn
me
up
dick
she
retorted
her
entrancing
low
chuckle
bubbling
through
her
words
you
do
say
the
weirdest
things
at
times
possibly
they
would
and
if
the
moon
were
made
of
different
stuff
than
it
is
and
had
a
different
color
it
might
be
green
cheese
too
what
say
we
go
over
and
look
at
the
stars
as
you
were
rufus
he
commanded
sternly
do
move
a
millimeter
you
a
drive
fit
right
where
you
are
i
get
you
any
stars
you
want
and
bring
them
right
in
here
to
you
what
constellation
would
you
like
i
get
you
the
southern
cross
we
never
see
it
in
washington
no
i
want
something
familiar
the
pleiades
or
the
big
dipper
no
get
me
canis
major
sirius
brightest
jewel
in
the
diadem
of
the
firmament
holds
sway
she
quoted
there
thought
i
forgotten
all
the
astronomy
you
ever
taught
me
did
you
think
you
can
find
it
sure
declination
about
minus
twenty
as
i
remember
it
and
right
ascension
between
six
and
seven
hours
let
see
where
would
that
be
from
our
course
he
thought
for
a
moment
manipulated
several
levers
and
dials
snapped
off
the
lights
and
swung
number
one
exterior
visiplate
around
directly
before
their
eyes
oh
oh
this
is
magnificent
dick
she
exclaimed
stupendous
it
seems
as
though
we
were
right
out
there
in
space
itself
and
not
in
here
at
all
it
it
just
too
perfectly
darn
wonderful
although
neither
of
them
was
unacquainted
with
interstellar
space
it
presents
a
spectacle
that
never
fails
to
awe
even
the
most
seasoned
observer
and
no
human
being
had
ever
before
viewed
the
wonders
of
space
from
such
a
coign
of
vantage
thus
the
two
fell
silent
and
awed
as
they
gazed
out
into
the
abysmal
depths
of
the
interstellar
void
the
darkness
of
earthly
night
is
ameliorated
by
scattered
by
the
atmosphere
the
stars
twinkle
and
scintillate
and
their
light
is
diffused
because
of
the
same
medium
but
here
what
a
contrast
they
saw
the
utter
absolute
darkness
of
the
complete
absence
of
all
light
and
upon
that
indescribable
blackness
they
beheld
superimposed
the
almost
unbearable
brilliance
of
enormous
suns
concentrated
into
mathematical
points
dimensionless
sirius
blazed
in
splendor
dominating
the
lesser
members
of
his
constellation
a
minute
but
intensely
brilliant
diamond
upon
a
field
of
black
velvet
his
refulgence
unmarred
by
any
trace
of
scintillation
or
distortion
as
seaton
slowly
shifted
the
field
of
vision
angling
toward
and
across
the
celestial
equator
and
the
ecliptic
they
beheld
in
turn
mighty
rigel
the
belt
headed
by
dazzlingly
red
betelguese
storied
aldebaran
the
friend
of
mariners
and
the
astronomically
constant
pleiades
seaton
arm
contracted
swinging
dorothy
into
his
embrace
their
lips
met
and
held
is
it
wonderful
lover
she
murmured
to
be
out
here
in
space
this
way
together
away
from
all
our
troubles
and
worries
i
am
so
happy
it
all
of
that
sweetheart
mine
i
almost
died
every
time
they
shot
at
you
suppose
your
armor
cracked
or
something
i
would
want
to
go
on
living
i
just
naturally
die
i
glad
it
did
and
i
twice
as
glad
that
they
did
succeed
in
grabbing
you
away
from
me
his
jaw
set
rigidly
his
gray
eyes
became
hard
as
tempered
drills
blackie
duquesne
has
something
coming
to
him
so
far
i
have
always
paid
my
debts
i
shall
settle
with
him
in
full
that
was
an
awfully
quick
change
of
subject
he
continued
his
voice
changing
instantly
into
a
lighter
vein
but
that
one
penalty
of
being
human
we
ca
live
in
high
altitudes
all
our
lives
if
we
could
there
would
be
no
thrill
in
ascending
them
so
often
yes
we
love
each
other
just
the
same
more
than
anybody
else
i
ever
heard
of
after
a
moment
she
eyed
him
shrewdly
and
continued
you
got
something
on
your
mind
besides
that
tangled
mop
of
hair
big
boy
tell
it
to
nothing
much
come
on
up
it
good
for
the
soul
you
ca
fool
your
own
wife
guy
i
know
your
little
winning
ways
too
well
let
me
finish
woman
i
was
about
to
bare
my
very
soul
to
resume
nothing
much
to
go
on
but
a
hunch
but
i
think
somewhere
out
here
in
the
great
open
spaces
where
men
are
sometimes
schemers
as
well
as
men
and
if
so
i
after
him
foot
horse
and
marines
that
object
compass
yes
you
see
i
built
that
thing
myself
and
i
know
darn
well
it
out
of
order
it
still
on
him
but
does
indicate
ergo
he
is
too
far
away
to
reach
and
with
his
weight
i
could
find
him
anywhere
up
to
about
one
and
a
half
if
he
wants
to
go
that
far
away
from
home
where
is
his
logical
destination
it
ca
be
anywhere
but
osnome
since
that
is
the
only
place
we
stopped
at
for
any
length
of
time
the
only
place
where
he
could
have
learned
anything
he
learned
something
or
found
something
useful
to
him
there
just
as
we
did
that
is
certain
since
he
is
not
the
type
of
man
to
do
anything
without
a
purpose
uncle
dudley
is
on
his
trail
and
will
be
able
to
locate
him
pretty
soon
when
will
you
get
that
new
exhausted
to
a
skillionth
of
a
whillimeter
or
something
whatever
it
is
i
thought
dunark
said
it
took
five
hundred
hours
of
pumping
to
get
it
where
he
wanted
it
it
did
him
but
while
the
osnomians
are
wonders
at
some
things
not
so
hot
at
others
you
see
i
got
three
pumps
on
that
job
in
series
first
a
a
then
backing
that
an
ordinary
pump
and
last
backing
both
the
others
a
oil
pump
in
less
than
fifty
hours
that
case
will
be
as
empty
as
a
flapper
skull
just
to
make
sure
of
cleaning
up
the
last
infinitesimal
traces
though
i
going
to
flash
a
getter
charge
of
tantalum
in
it
after
that
the
atmosphere
in
that
case
will
be
tenuous
take
my
word
for
it
a
j
am
chem
soc
i
have
to
most
of
that
contribution
to
science
being
over
my
head
like
a
circus

say
we
let
drift

for

sweet

chapter
iv
the
zone
of
force
is
tested
seaton
strode
into
the
control
room
with
a
small
oblong
box
in
his
hand
crane
was
seated
at
the
desk
poring
over
an
abstruse
mathematical
treatise
in
margaret
was
working
upon
a
bit
of
embroidery
dorothy
seated
upon
a
cushion
on
the
floor
with
one
foot
tucked
under
her
was
reading
her
hand
straying
from
time
to
time
to
a
box
of
chocolates
conveniently
near
well
this
is
a
peaceful
scene
too
bad
to
bust
it
up
just
finished
sealing
off
and
flashing
out
this
case
mart
going
to
see
if
she
read
want
to
take
a
look
he
placed
the
compass
upon
the
plane
table
so
that
its
final
bearing
could
be
read
upon
the
master
circles
controlled
by
the
gyroscopes
then
simultaneously
started
his
and
pressed
the
button
which
caused
a
minute
couple
to
be
applied
to
the
needle
instantly
the
needle
began
to
revolve
and
for
many
minutes
there
was
no
apparent
change
in
its
motion
in
either
the
primary
or
secondary
bearings
do
you
suppose
it
is
out
of
order
after
all
asked
crane
regretfully
i
do
think
so
seaton
pondered
you
see
they
were
designed
to
indicate
such
distances
on
such
small
objects
as
men
so
i
threw
a
million
ohms
in
series
with
the
impulse
that
cuts
down
the
free
rotation
to
less
than
half
an
hour
and
increases
the
sensitivity
to
the
limit
there
is
she
trying
to
quit
it
yes
it
is
settling
down
it
must
be
on
him
still
finally
the
needle
came
to
rest
when
it
had
done
so
seaton
calculated
the
distance
read
the
direction
and
made
a
reading
upon
osnome
he
there
all
right
bearings
agree
and
distances
check
to
within
a
which
is
as
close
as
we
can
hope
to
check
on
as
small
a
mass
as
a
man
well
that
that
nothing
to
do
about
it
until
after
we
get
there
one
sure
thing
mart
we
not
coming
straight
back
home
from
no
an
investigation
is
indicated
well
that
puts
me
out
of
a
job
what
to
do
do
want
to
study
like
you
ca
crochet
like
peg
darned
if
i
sit
on
a
pillow
and
eat
candy
like
that
titian
blonde
over
there
on
the
floor
i
know
what
i
build
me
a
mechanical
educator
and
teach
shiro
to
talk
english
instead
of
that
mess
of
language
he
indulges
in
how
that
be
mart
do
do
it
put
in
dorothy
positively
he
just
too
perfect
the
way
he
is
especially
do
do
it
if
he
talk
the
way
you
do
or
could
you
teach
him
to
talk
the
way
you
write
ouch
that
a
dirty
dig
however
seaton
i
am
able
and
willing
to
defend
my
customary
mode
of
speech
you
realize
that
the
spoken
word
is
ephemeral
whereas
the
thought
whose
nuances
have
once
been
expressed
in
imperishable
print
is
not
subject
to
revision
its
crudities
can
never
be
remodeled
into
more
subtle
more
gracious
shading
it
is
my
contention
that
due
to
these
inescapable
conditions
the
mental
effort
necessitated
by
the
employment
of
nice
distinctions
in
sense
and
meaning
of
words
and
a
slavish
adherence
to
the
dictates
of
the
more
precise
grammarians
should
be
reserved
for
the
print
he
broke
off
as
dorothy
in
one
lithe
motion
rose
and
hurled
her
pillow
at
his
head
choke
him
somebody
perhaps
you
had
better
build
it
dick
after
all
i
believe
that
he
would
like
it
dick
he
is
trying
hard
to
learn
and
the
continuous
use
of
a
dictionary
is
undoubtedly
a
nuisance
to
him
i
ask
him
shiro
you
have
call
sir
shiro
entered
the
room
from
his
galley
with
his
unfailing
bow
yes
how
you
like
to
learn
to
talk
english
like
crane
there
does
without
taking
lessons
shiro
smiled
doubtfully
unable
to
take
such
a
thought
seriously
yes
it
can
be
done
crane
assured
him
doctor
seaton
can
build
a
machine
which
will
teach
you
all
at
once
if
you
like
i
like
sir
enormously
yes
sir
i
years
study
and
pore
but
honorable
english
extraordinary
difference
from
nipponese
no
can
do
dictionary
useful
but
he
flipped
pages
dexterously
extremely
cumbrous
if
honorable
seaton
can
do
shall
be
extreme
gratification
he
bowed
again
smiled
and
went
out
i
do
just
that
little
thing
so
long
folks
i
going
up
to
the
shop
day
after
day
the
plunged
through
the
vast
emptiness
of
the
interstellar
reaches
at
the
end
of
each
second
she
was
traveling
exactly
feet
per
second
faster
than
she
had
been
at
its
beginning
and
as
day
after
day
passed
her
velocity
mounted
into
figures
which
became
meaningless
even
when
expressed
in
thousands
of
miles
per
second
still
she
seemed
stationary
to
her
occupants
and
only
different
from
a
vessel
motionless
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
in
that
objects
within
her
hull
had
lost
of
their
normal
weight
acceleration
too
had
its
effect
only
the
rapidity
with
which
the
closer
suns
and
their
planets
were
passed
gave
any
indication
of
the
frightful
speed
at
which
they
were
being
hurtled
along
by
the
inconceivable
power
of
that
disintegrating
copper
bar
when
the
vessel
was
nearly
to
x
the
bar
was
reversed
in
order
to
change
the
sign
of
their
acceleration
and
the
hollow
sphere
spun
through
an
angle
of
one
hundred
and
eighty
degrees
around
the
motionless
cage
which
housed
the
enormous
gyroscopes
still
apparently
motionless
and
exactly
as
she
had
been
before
the
was
now
actually
traveling
in
a
direction
which
seemed
down
and
with
a
velocity
which
was
being
constantly
decreased
by
the
amount
of
their
negative
acceleration
a
few
days
after
the
bar
had
been
reversed
seaton
announced
that
the
mechanical
educator
was
complete
and
brought
it
into
the
control
room
in
appearance
it
was
not
unlike
a
large
radio
set
but
it
was
infinitely
more
complex
it
possessed
numerous
tubes
and
cells
as
well
as
many
coils
of
peculiar
design
there
were
dozens
of
dials
and
knobs
and
a
multiple
set
of
how
can
a
thing
like
that
possibly
work
as
it
does
asked
crane
i
know
that
it
does
work
but
i
could
scarcely
believe
it
even
after
it
had
educated
me
that
is
nothing
like
the
one
dunark
used
dick
objected
dorothy
how
come
i
answer
you
first
dot
this
is
an
improved
model
it
has
quite
a
few
gadgets
of
my
own
in
it
now
mart
as
to
how
it
works
it
is
so
funny
after
you
understand
it
it
a
lot
like
radio
in
that
respect
it
operates
on
a
band
of
frequencies
lying
between
the
longest
light
and
heat
waves
and
the
shortest
radio
waves
this
thing
here
is
the
generator
of
those
waves
and
a
very
heavy
power
amplifier
the
headsets
are
stereoscopic
transmitters
taking
or
receiving
a
view
nearly
all
matter
is
transparent
to
those
waves
for
instance
bones
hair
and
so
on
however
cerebin
a
cerebroside
peculiar
to
the
thinking
structure
of
the
brain
is
opaque
to
them
dunark
not
knowing
chemistry
did
know
why
the
educator
worked
or
what
it
worked
on
he
found
out
by
experiment
that
it
did
work
just
as
we
found
out
about
electricity
this
model
or
view
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
is
converted
into
electricity
in
the
headsets
and
the
resulting
modulated
wave
goes
back
to
the
educator
there
it
is
heterodyned
with
another
wave
this
second
frequency
was
found
after
thousands
of
trials
and
is
i
believe
the
exact
frequency
existing
in
the
optic
nerves
themselves
and
sent
to
the
receiving
headset
modulated
as
it
is
and
producing
a
picture
after
rectification
in
the
receiver
it
reproduces
exactly
what
has
been
if
due
allowance
has
been
made
for
the
size
and
configuration
of
the
different
brains
involved
in
the
transfer
you
remember
a
sort
of
flash
a
sensation
of
seeing
something
when
the
educator
worked
on
you
well
you
did
see
it
just
as
though
it
had
been
transmitted
to
the
brain
by
the
optic
nerve
but
everything
came
at
once
so
the
impression
of
sight
was
confused
the
result
in
the
brain
however
was
clear
and
permanent
the
only
drawback
is
that
you
have
the
visual
memory
of
what
you
have
learned
and
that
sometimes
makes
it
hard
to
use
your
knowledge
you
do
know
whether
you
know
anything
about
a
certain
subject
or
not
until
after
you
go
digging
around
in
your
brain
looking
for
it
i
see
said
crane
and
dorothy
the
irrepressible
put
in
just
as
clear
as
so
much
mud
what
are
the
improvements
you
added
to
the
original
design
well
you
see
i
had
a
big
advantage
in
knowing
that
cerebrin
was
the
substance
involved
and
with
that
knowledge
i
could
carry
matters
considerably
farther
than
dunark
could
in
his
original
model
i
can
transfer
the
thoughts
of
somebody
else
to
a
third
party
or
to
a
record
dunark
machine
could
work
against
resistance
if
the
subject
willing
to
give
up
his
thoughts
he
could
get
them
this
one
can
take
them
away
by
force
in
fact
by
increasing
plate
and
grid
voltages
in
the
amplifier
i
can
pretty
nearly
burn
out
a
man
brain
yesterday
i
was
playing
with
it
transferring
a
section
of
my
own
brain
to
a
magnetized
tape
for
a
permanent
record
you
know
and
found
out
that
above
certain
rather
low
voltages
it
becomes
a
form
of
torture
that
would
make
the
best
efforts
of
the
old
inquisition
seem
like
a
petting
party
did
you
succeed
in
the
transfer
crane
was
intensely
interested
sure
push
the
button
for
shiro
and
we
start
something
put
your
head
against
this
screen
he
directed
when
shiro
had
come
in
smiling
and
bowing
as
usual
i
got
to
caliper
your
brains
to
do
a
good
job
the
calipering
done
he
adjusted
various
dials
and
clamped
the
electrodes
over
his
own
head
and
over
the
heads
of
crane
and
shiro
want
to
learn
japanese
while
we
at
it
mart
i
going
to
yes
please
i
tried
to
learn
it
while
i
was
in
japan
but
it
was
altogether
too
difficult
to
be
worth
while
seaton
threw
in
a
switch
opened
it
depressed
two
more
opened
them
and
threw
off
the
power
all
set
he
reported
crisply
and
barked
a
series
of
explosive
syllables
at
shiro
ending
upon
a
rising
note
yes
sir
answered
the
japanese
you
speak
nipponese
as
though
you
had
never
spoken
any
other
tongue
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
sir
that
i
may
now
discard
my
dictionary
how
about
you
two
girls
anything
you
want
to
learn
in
a
hurry
not
me
declared
dorothy
emphatically
that
machine
is
too
darn
weird
to
suit
me
besides
if
i
knew
as
much
about
science
as
you
do
probably
fight
about
it
i
do
not
believe
i
care
to
began
margaret
she
was
interrupted
by
the
penetrating
sound
of
an
alarm
bell
that
a
new
note
exclaimed
seaton
i
never
heard
that
note
before
he
stood
in
surprise
at
the
board
where
a
brilliant
purple
light
was
flashing
slowly
great
cat
that
a
purely
osnomian
kind
of
a
battleship
detector
shows
that
there
a
boatload
of
bad
news
around
here
somewhere
grab
the
visiplates
quick
folks
as
he
rang
shiro
bell
i
take
visiplate
area
one
dead
ahead
mart
take
number
two
dot
three
peg
four
shiro
five
look
sharp
nothing
in
front
see
anything
any
of
you
none
of
them
could
discover
anything
amiss
but
the
purple
light
continued
to
flash
and
the
bell
to
ring
seaton
cut
off
the
bell
we
almost
to
he
thought
aloud
ca
be
more
than
a
million
miles
or
so
and
we
almost
stopped
wonder
if
somebody
there
ahead
of
us
maybe
dunark
is
doing
this
though
i
call
him
and
see
he
threw
in
a
switch
and
said
one
word
dunark
here
came
the
voice
of
the
kofedix
from
the
speaker
are
you
generating
no
just
called
to
see
if
you
were
what
do
you
make
of
it
nothing
as
yet
better
close
up
yes
edge
over
this
way
and
i
come
over
to
meet
you
leave
your
negative
as
it
is
we
be
stopped
directly
whatever
it
is
it
dead
ahead
it
a
long
ways
off
yet
but
we
better
get
organized
talk
much
either
they
may
intercept
our
wave
narrow
as
it
is
better
yet
shut
off
your
radio
entirely
when
we
get
close
enough
together
we
use
the
you
may
not
know
that
you
know
it
but
you
do
turn
your
heaviest
searchlight
toward
me
i
do
the
same
there
was
a
click
as
dunark
power
was
shut
off
abruptly
and
seaton
grinned
as
he
cut
his
own
that
right
too
folks
in
osnomian
battles
we
always
used
a
when
we
could
hear
anything
and
that
was
most
of
the
time
i
know
it
as
well
as
i
know
english
now
that
i
am
reminded
of
the
fact
he
shifted
his
course
to
intercept
that
of
the
osnomian
vessel
after
a
time
the
watchers
picked
out
a
minute
point
of
light
moving
comparatively
rapidly
against
the
stars
and
knew
it
to
be
the
searchlight
of
the
soon
the
two
vessels
were
almost
side
by
side
moving
cautiously
forward
and
seaton
set
up
a
parabolic
reflector
focused
upon
a
coil
as
they
went
on
the
purple
light
continued
to
flash
more
and
more
rapidly
but
still
nothing
was
to
be
seen
take
number
six
visiplate
will
you
mart
it
telescopic
equivalent
to
a
refractor
i
tell
you
where
to
look
in
a
minute
this
reflector
increases
the
power
of
the
regular
indicator
he
studied
meters
and
adjusted
dials
set
on
nineteen
hours
minutes
and
two
hundred
degrees
he
too
far
away
yet
to
read
exactly
but
that
put
him
in
the
field
of
vision
is
this
radiation
harmful
asked
margaret
not
yet
it
too
weak
pretty
soon
we
may
be
able
to
feel
it
then
i
throw
out
a
screen
against
it
when
it
strong
enough
it
pretty
deadly
stuff
see
anything
mart
i
see
something
but
it
is
very
indistinct
it
is
moving
in
sharper
now
yes
it
is
a
shaped
like
a
dirigible
airship
see
it
yet
dunark
seaton
signaled
just
sighted
it
ready
to
attack
i
am
not
i
going
to
run
let
go
and
go
fast
dunark

yes
he

that
it

be

neither

all
in

about
it

grimly
you

at

twice

could
get
with

was
waiting
for
us

on
get
away
if
you
can
you
can
stand
a
higher
acceleration
than
we
can
we
hold
him
as
long
as
possible
i
would
if
it
would
do
any
good

it
wo
he
so
much
faster
than
we
are
that
he
could
catch
us
anyway
if
he
wanted
to
no
matter
how
much
of
a
start
we
had
and
it
looks
now
as
though
he
wanted
us
two
of
us
stand
a
lot
better
chance
than
one
of
licking
him
if
he
looking
for
trouble
spread
out
a
mile
or
two

pretend
this
is

a

enveloped
the

as
a
radiation
from

struck
the

screen
and
dissipated
its
force
harmlessly
in
the

instantly
seaton
threw
on
the
full
power
of
his
refrigerating
system
and
shot
in
the
master

that
actuated
the
complex
offensive
armament
of

dreadnought

an
intense
livid

bars
and
long
flashes
leaped
between

in
all
parts
of

the
passengers
felt
each
hair
striving
to
stand
on
end
as
the
very
air
became
more
and
more
highly
charged
and
this
was
but
the
slight
of
the
frightful
stream
of
destruction
being
hurled
at
the
other
now
scarcely
a
mile
away
seaton
stared
into
number
one
visiplate
manipulating
levers
and
dials
as
he
drove
the
hither
and
yon
dodging
frantically
the
while
the
automatic
focusing
devices
remained
centered
upon
the
enemy
and
the
enormous
generators
continued
to
pour
forth
their
deadly
frequencies
the
bars
glowed
more
fiercely
as
they
were
advanced
to
full
working
load
the
stranger
was
one
blaze
of
incandescent
ionization
but
she
still
fought
on
and
seaton
noticed
that
the
pyrometers
recording
the
temperature
of
the
shell
were
mounting
rapidly
in
spite
of
the
refrigerators
dunark
put
everything
you
got
upon
one
spot
right
on
the
end
of
his
nose
as
the
first
shell
struck
the
mark
seaton
concentrated
every
force
at
his
command
upon
the
designated
point
the
air
in
the
crackled
and
hissed
and
intense
violet
flames
leaped
from
the
bars
as
they
were
driven
almost
to
the
point
of
disruption
from
the
forward
end
of
the
strange
craft
there
erupted
prominence
after
prominence
of
searing
unbearable
flame
as
the
terrific
charges
of
explosive
copper
struck
the
mark
and
exploded
liberating
instantaneously
their
millions
upon
millions
of
of
energy
each
prominence
enveloped
all
three
of
the
fighting
vessels
and
extended
for
hundreds
of
miles
out
into
space
but
still
the
enemy
warship
continued
to
hurl
forth
solid
and
vibratory
destruction
a
brilliant
orange
light
flared
upon
the
panel
and
seaton
gasped
as
he
swung
his
visiplate
upon
his
defenses
which
he
had
supposed
impregnable
his
outer
screen
was
already
down
although
its
mighty
copper
generator
was
exerting
its
utmost
power
black
areas
had
already
appeared
and
were
spreading
rapidly
where
there
should
have
been
only
incandescent
radiance
and
the
inner
screen
was
even
now
radiating
far
into
the
and
was
certainly
doomed
knowing
as
he
did
the
stupendous
power
driving
those
screens
he
knew
that
there
were
superhuman
and
inconceivable
forces
being
directed
against
them
and
his
right
hand
flashed
to
the
switch
controlling
the
zone
of
force
fast
as
he
was
much
happened
in
the
mere
moment
that
passed
before
his
flying
hand
could
close
the
switch
in
the
last
infinitesimal
instant
of
time
before
the
zone
closed
in
a
gaping
black
hole
appeared
in
the
incandescence
of
the
inner
screen
and
a
small
portion
of
a
ray
of
energy
so
stupendous
as
to
be
palpable
struck
like
a
tangible
projectile
the
exposed
flank
of
the
instantly
the
refractory
arenak
turned
an
intense
dazzling
white
and
more
than
a
foot
of
the
skin
of
the
vessel
melted
away
like
snow
before
an
flame
melting
and
flying
away
in
molten
globes
and
sparkling
gases
the
refrigerating
coils
lining
the
hull
were
of
no
avail
against
the
concentrated
energy
of
that
titanic
thrust
as
seaton
shut
off
his
power
intense
darkness
and
utter
silence
closed
in
and
he
snapped
on
the
lights
they
take
one
trick
he
blazed
his
eyes
almost
emitting
sparks
and
leaped
for
the
generators
he
had
forgotten
the
efforts
of
the
zone
of
force
however
and
only
sprawled
grotesquely
in
the
air
until
he
floated
within
reach
of
a
line
hold
everything
dick
crane
snapped
as
seaton
bent
over
one
of
the
bars
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
going
to
put
as
heavy
bars
in
these
as
they
stand
and
go
out
and
get
that
bird
we
ca
lick
him
with
osnomian
rays
or
with
our
explosive
copper
but
i
can
carve
that
sausage
into
slices
with
a
zone
of
force
and
i
going
to
do
it
steady
old
man
take
it
easy
i
see
your
point
but
remember
that
you
must
release
the
zone
of
force
before
you
can
use
it
as
a
weapon
furthermore
you
must
discover
his
exact
location
and
must
get
close
enough
to
him
to
use
the
zone
as
a
weapon
all
without
its
protection
can
those
be
made
sufficiently
powerful
to
withstand
the
beam
they
employed
last
even
for
a
second
hm
m
never
thought
of
that
mart
seaton
replied
the
fire
dying
out
of
his
eyes
wonder
how
long
the
battle
lasted
eight
and
seconds
from
first
to
last
but
they
had
had
that
heavy
ray
in
action
only
a
fraction
of
one
second
when
you
cut
in
the
zone
of
force
either
they
underestimated
our
strength
at
first
or
else
it
required
about
eight
seconds
to
tune
in
their
heavy
generators
probably
the
former
but
we
to
do
something
man
we
ca
just
sit
here
and
twiddle
our
thumbs
why
and
why
not
that
course
seems
eminently
wise
and
proper
in
fact
at
the
present
time
is
distinctly
indicated
oh
you
full
of
little
red
ants
we
ca
do
a
thing
with
that
zone
on
and
you
say
just
sit
here
suppose
they
know
all
about
that
zone
of
force
suppose
they
can
crack
it
suppose
they
ram
us
i
shall
take
up
your
objections
in
order
crane
had
lighted
a
cigarette
and
was
smoking
meditatively
first
they
may
or
may
not
know
about
it
at
present
that
point
is
immaterial
second
whether
or
not
they
know
about
it
it
is
almost
a
certainty
that
they
can
not
crack
it
it
had
been
up
for
more
than
three
minutes
and
they
have
undoubtedly
concentrated
everything
possible
upon
us
during
that
time
it
is
still
standing
i
really
expected
it
to
go
down
in
the
first
few
seconds
but
now
that
it
has
held
this
long
it
will
in
all
probability
continue
to
hold
indefinitely
third
they
most
certainly
will
not
ram
us
for
several
reasons
they
probably
have
encountered
few
if
any
foreign
vessels
able
to
stand
against
them
for
a
minute
and
will
act
accordingly
then
too
it
is
probably
safe
to
assume
that
their
vessel
is
damaged
to
some
slight
extent
at
least
for
i
do
not
believe
that
any
possible
armament
could
withstand
the
forces
you
directed
against
them
and
escape
entirely
unscathed
finally
if
they
did
ram
us
what
would
happen
would
we
feel
the
shock
that
barrier
in
the
ether
seems
impervious
and
if
so
it
could
not
transmit
a
blow
i
do
not
see
exactly
how
it
would
affect
the
ship
dealing
the
blow
you
are
the
one
who
works
out
the
new
problems
in
unexplored
mathematics
some
time
you
must
take
a
few
months
off
and
work
it
out
yes
it
would
take
that
long
too
i
guess
but
you
right
he
hurt
us
that
using
the
old
bean
mart
i
was
going
off
again
darn
it
i
pipe
down
and
we
go
into
a
huddle
seaton
noticed
that
dorothy
face
was
white
and
that
she
was
fighting
for
drawing
himself
over
to
her
he
picked
her
up
in
a
tight
embrace
cheer
up
this
man
war
ai
started
yet
not
started
what
do
you
mean
have
you
and
martin
just
been
admitting
to
each
other
that
you
ca
do
anything
does
that
mean
that
we
are
beaten
beaten
us
how
do
you
get
that
way
not
on
your
sweet
young
life
he
ejaculated
and
the
surprise
on
his
face
was
so
manifest
that
she
recovered
instantly
we
just
dug
a
hole
and
pulled
the
hole
in
after
us
that
all
when
we
get
everything
doped
out
to
suit
us
we
snap
out
of
it
and
that
bird
think
he
been
petting
a
wildcat
mart
you
the
thinking
end
of
this
partnership
he
continued
thoughtfully
you
got
the
analytical
mind
and
the
judicial
disposition
and
can
think
circles
around
me
from
what
little
seen
of
those
folks
tell
me
who
what
and
where
they
are
i
getting
the
germ
of
an
idea
and
maybe
we
can
make
it
work
i
will
try
it
crane
paused
they
are
of
course
neither
from
the
earth
nor
from
osnome
it
is
also
evident
that
they
have
solved
the
secret
of
energy
their
vessels
are
not
propelled
as
ours
are
they
have
so
perfected
that
force
that
it
acts
upon
every
particle
of
the
structure
and
its
contents
how
do
you
figure
that
blurted
seaton
because
of
the
acceleration
they
can
stand
nothing
even
and
probably
nothing
living
could
endure
it
otherwise
right
yes
i
never
thought
of
that
furthermore
they
are
far
from
home
for
if
they
were
from
anywhere
nearby
the
osnomians
would
have
known
of
them
particularly
since
it
is
evident
from
the
size
of
the
vessel
that
it
is
not
a
recent
development
with
them
as
it
is
with
us
since
the
green
system
is
close
to
the
center
of
the
galaxy
it
seems
reasonable
as
a
working
hypothesis
to
assume
that
they
are
from
some
system
far
from
the
center
perhaps
close
to
the
outer
edge
they
are
very
evidently
of
a
high
degree
of
intelligence
they
are
also
highly
treacherous
and
merciless
why
asked
dorothy
who
was
listening
eagerly
i
deduce
those
characteristics
from
their
unprovoked
attack
upon
peaceful
ships
vastly
smaller
and
supposedly
of
inferior
armament
and
also
from
the
nature
of
that
attack
this
vessel
is
probably
a
scout
or
an
exploring
ship
since
it
seems
to
be
alone
it
is
not
altogether
beyond
the
bounds
of
reason
to
imagine
it
upon
a
voyage
of
discovery
in
search
of
new
planets
to
be
subjugated
and
colonized
that
a
sweet
picture
of
our
future
neighbors
but
i
guess
hitting
the
old
nail
on
the
head
at
that
if
these
deductions
are
anywhere
nearly
correct
they
are
terrible
neighbors
for
my
next
point
are
we
justified
in
assuming
that
they
do
or
do
not
know
about
the
zone
of
force
that
a
hard
one
knowing
what
they
evidently
do
know
it
hard
to
see
how
they
could
have
missed
it
and
yet
if
they
had
known
about
it
for
a
long
time
would
they
be
able
to
get
through
it
of
course
it
may
be
a
real
and
total
barrier
in
the
ether
in
that
case
they
know
that
they
could
do
a
thing
as
long
as
we
keep
it
on
take
your
choice
but
i
believe
that
they
know
about
it
and
know
more
than
we
do
that
it
is
a
total
barrier
set
up
in
the
ether
i
agree
with
you
and
we
shall
proceed
upon
that
assumption
they
know
then
that
neither
they
nor
we
can
do
anything
as
long
as
we
maintain
the
zone
that
it
is
a
stalemate
they
also
know
that
it
takes
an
enormous
amount
of
power
to
keep
the
zone
in
place
now
we
have
gone
as
far
as
we
can
go
upon
the
meager
data
we
have
considerably
farther
than
we
really
are
justified
in
going
we
must
now
try
to
come
to
some
conclusion
concerning
their
present
activities
if
our
ideas
as
to
their
natures
are
even
approximately
correct
they
are
waiting
probably
fairly
close
at
hand
until
we
shall
be
compelled
to
release
the
zone
no
matter
how
long
that
period
of
waiting
shall
be
they
know
of
course
from
our
small
size
that
we
can
not
carry
enough
copper
to
maintain
it
indefinitely
as
they
could
does
that
sound
reasonable
i
check
you
to
nineteen
decimal
places
mart
and
from
your
ideas
getting
surer
and
surer
that
we
can
pull
their
corks
i
can
get
into
action
in
a
hurry
when
i
have
to
and
my
idea
now
is
to
wait
until
they
relax
a
trifle
and
then
slip
a
fast
one
over
on
them
one
more
bubble
out
of
the
old
and
i
let
you
off
for
the
day
at
what
time
will
their
vigilance
be
at
lowest
ebb
that
a
poser
i
admit
but
the
answer
to
it
may
answer
everything
the
first
shot
will
of
course
be
the
best
chance
we
ever
have
yes
we
should
succeed
in
the
first
attempt
we
have
very
little
information
to
guide
us
in
answering
that
question
he
studied
the
problem
for
many
minutes
before
he
resumed
i
should
say
that
for
a
time
they
would
keep
all
their
rays
and
other
weapons
in
action
against
the
zone
of
force
expecting
us
to
release
it
immediately
then
knowing
that
they
were
wasting
power
uselessly
they
would
cease
attacking
but
would
be
very
watchful
with
every
eye
fastened
upon
us
and
with
every
weapon
ready
for
instant
use
after
this
period
of
vigilance
regular
ship
routine
would
be
resumed
half
the
force
probably
would
go
off
duty
for
if
they
are
even
remotely
like
any
organic
beings
with
which
we
are
familiar
they
require
sleep
or
its
equivalent
at
intervals
the
men
on
duty
the
normal
force
that
is
would
be
doubly
careful
for
a
time
then
habit
will
assert
itself
if
we
have
done
nothing
to
create
suspicion
and
their
watchfulness
will
relax
to
the
point
of
ordinary
careful
observation
toward
the
end
of
their
watch
because
of
the
strain
of
the
battle
and
because
of
the
unusually
long
period
of
duty
they
will
become
careless
and
their
vigilance
will
be
considerably
below
normal
but
the
exact
time
of
all
these
things
depends
entirely
upon
their
conception
of
time
concerning
which
we
have
no
information
whatever
though
it
is
purely
a
speculation
based
upon
earthly
and
osnomian
experience
i
should
say
that
after
twelve
or
thirteen
hours
would
come
the
time
for
us
to
make
the
attack
that
good
enough
for
me
fine
mart
and
thanks
you
probably
saved
the
lives
of
the
party
we
will
now
sleep
for
eleven

how
could
you
dorothy
exclaimed
chapter
v
first

the
next
twelve
hours
dragged
with
terrible
slowness
sleep
was
impossible
and
eating
was
difficult
even
though
all
knew
that
they
would
have
need
of
the
full
measure
of
their
strength
seaton
set
up
various
combinations
of
switching
devices
connected
to
electrical
timers
and
spent
hours
trying
with
all
his
marvelous
quickness
of
muscular
control
to
cut
shorter
and
ever
shorter
the
time
between
the
opening
and
the
closing
of
the
switch
at
last
he
arranged
a
powerful
device
so
that
one
impulse
would
both
open
and
close
the
switch
with
an
open
period
of
one
of
a
second
only
then
was
he
satisfied
a
thousandth
is
enough
to
give
us
a
look
around
due
to
persistence
of
vision
and
it
is
short
enough
so
that
they
wo
see
it
unless
they
have
a
recording
observer
on
us
even
if
they
still
have
rays
on
us
they
ca
possibly
neutralize
our
screens
in
that
short
an

all
right
gang
we
take
five
visiplates
and
cover
the
sphere
if
any
of
you
get

he
pressed
the
button
the
stars
flashed
in
the
black
void
for
an
instant
then
were
again
shut
out
here
he
is
dick
shrieked
margaret
right
here
he
covered
almost
half
the
visiplate
she
outlined
for
him
as
nearly
as
she
could
the
exact
position
of
the
object
she
had
seen
and
he
calculated
rapidly
fine
business
he
exulted
he
within
half
a
mile
of
us
on
perfect
i
thought
he
be
so
far
away
that
i
have
to
take
photographs
to
locate
him
he
has
a
single
ray
on
us
either
that
bird
goose
is
cooked
right
now
folks
unless
every
man
on
watch
has
his

right
on
the
controls
of

and
can
get
into
action
in

than

hang
on
gang
i
going
to
step
on
the
gas
after
making
sure
that
everyone
was
fastened
immovably
in
their
seats
he
strapped
himself
in
the
pilot
seat
then
set
the
bar
toward
the
strange
vessel
and
applied
fully
of
its
full
power
the
of
course
did
not
move
then
with
bewildering
rapidity
he
went
into
action
face
glued
to
the
visiplate
hands
moving
faster
than
the
eye
could
follow
the
left
closing
and
opening
the
switch
controlling
the
zone
of

the
right
swinging
the
steering

to
all
points
of
the

the
mighty
vessel
staggered
this
way
and
that
jerking
and
straining
terribly
as
the
zone
was
thrown
on
and
off
lurching
sickeningly
about
the
central
bearing
as
the
gigantic
power
of
the
driving
bar
was
exerted
now
in
one
direction
now
in
another
after
a
second
or
two
of
this
mad
gyration
seaton
shut
off
the
power
he
then
released
the
zone
after
assuring
himself
that
both
inner
and
outer
screens
were
operating
at
the
highest
possible
rating
there
that
hold
for
a
while
i
guess
this
battle
was
even
shorter
than
the
other
one
and
a
lot
more
decisive
let
turn
on
the
and
see
what
the
pieces
look
like
the
lights
revealed
that
the
zone
of
force
had
indeed
sliced
the
enemy
vessel
into
pieces
no
fragment
was
large
enough
to
be
navigable
or
dangerous
and
each
was
sharply
cut
as
though
sheared
from
its
neighbor
by
some
gigantic
curved
blade
dorothy
sobbed
with
relief
in
arms
as
crane
with
one
arm
around
his
wife
grasped
his
hand
that
was
flawless
dick
as
an
exhibition
of
perfect
and
instantaneous
timing
under
extreme
physical
difficulties
i
have
never
seen
its
equal
you
certainly
saved
all
our
lives
margaret
added
only
peg
seaton
protested
and
blushed
vividly
mart
did
most
of
it
you
know
i
have
gummed
up
everything
back
there
if
he
had
let
me
let
see
what
we
can
find
out
about
them
he
touched
the
lever
and
the
moved
slowly
toward
the
wreckage
the
scattered
fragments
of
which
were
beginning
to
move
toward
and
around
each
other
because
of
their
mutual
gravitational
forces
snapping
on
a
searchlight
he
swung
its
beam
around
and
as
it
settled
upon
one
of
the
larger
sections
he
saw
a
group
of
hooded
figures
some
of
them
upon
the
metal
others
floating
slowly
toward
it
through
space
poor
devils
they
did
have
a
chance
he
remarked
regretfully
however
it
was
either
they
or
we
look
out
sweet
spirits
of
niter
he
leaped
back
to
the
controls
and
the
others
were
hurled
bodily
to
the
floor
as
he
applied
the
power
for
at
a
signal
each
of
the
hooded
figures
had
leveled
a
tube
and
once
more
the
outer
screen
had
flamed
into
incandescence
as
the
leaped
away
seaton
focussed
an
attractor
upon
the
one
who
had
apparently
signaled
the
attack
rolling
the
vessel
over
in
a
short
loop
so
that
the
captive
was
hurled
off
into
space
upon
the
other
side
he
snatched
the
tube
from
the
figure
grasp
with
one
auxiliary
attractor
and
anchored
head
and
limbs
with
others
so
that
the
prisoner
could
scarcely
move
a
muscle
then
while
crane
and
the
women
scrambled
up
off
the
floor
and
hurried
to
the
visiplates
seaton
cut
in
rays
six
and
ray
six
the
softener
was
a
band
of
frequencies
extending
from
violet
far
up
into
the
when
driven
with
sufficient
power
this
ray
destroyed
eyesight
and
nervous
tissue
and
its
power
increased
still
further
actually
loosened
the
molecular
structure
of
matter
ray
was
operated
in
a
range
of
frequencies
far
below
the
visible
red
it
was
pure
heat
under
its
action
matter
became
hotter
and
hotter
as
long
as
it
was
applied
the
upper
limit
being
only
the
theoretical
maximum
of
temperature
ray
was
alternating
current
any
conductor
in
its
path
behaved
precisely
as
it
would
in
the
induction
furnace
which
can
boil
platinum
in
ten
seconds
these
three
rays
composed
the
beam
which
seaton
directed
upon
the
mass
of
metal
from
which
the
enemy
had
elected
to
continue
the
battle
and
behind
each
ray
instead
of
the
small
energy
at
the
command
of
its
osnomian
inventor
were
the
untold
millions
of
kilowatts
developed
by
a
bar
of
disintegrating
copper
there
ensued
a
brief
but
appalling
demonstration
of
the
terrible
effectiveness
of
those
osnomian
weapons
against
anything
not
protected
by
ray
screens
metal
and
men
if
men
they
were
literally
vanished
one
moment
they
were
outlined
starkly
in
the
beam
there
was
a
moment
of
searing
coruscating
blinding
light
the
next
moment
the
beam
bored
on
into
the
void
unimpeded
nothing
was
visible
save
an
occasional
tiny
flash
as
some
condensed
or
solidified
droplet
of
the
volatilized
metal
the
path
of
that
ravening
beam
we
see
if
there
any
more
of
them
loose
seaton
remarked
as
he
shut
off
the
force
and
probed
into
the
wreckage
with
a
searchlight
no
sign
of
life
or
of
activity
was
revealed
and
the
light
was
turned
upon
the
captive
he
was
held
motionless
in
the
invisible
grip
of
the
attractors
at
the
point
where
the
force
of
those
peculiar
magnets
was
exactly
balanced
by
the
outward
thrust
of
the
repellers
by
manipulating
the
attractor
holding
it
seaton
brought
the
strange
tubular
weapon
into
the
through
a
small
in
the
wall
and
examined
it
curiously
but
did
not
touch
it
i
never
heard
of
a
before
so
i
guess
i
wo
play
with
it
much
until
after
i
learn
something
about
it
so
you
have
taken
a
captive
asked
margaret
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
i
going
to
drag
him
in
here
and
read
his
mind
he
one
of
the
officers
of
that
ship
i
believe
and
i
going
to
find
out
how
to
build
one
exactly
like
it
this
old
can
is
now
as
obsolete
as
a
flivver
and
i
going
to
make
us
a
later
model
how
about
it
mart
do
we
want
something
really
if
we
going
to
keep
on
we
certainty
do
those
denizens
seem
to
be
particularly
venomous
and
we
will
not
be
safe
unless
we
have
the
most
powerful
and
most
efficient
possible
however
that
fellow
may
be
dangerous
even
now
in
fact
it
is
practically
certain
that
he
is
you
chirped
it
ace
i
much
rather
touch
a
pound
of
dry
nitrogen
iodide
i
got
him
so
that
he
ca
destroy
his
brain
until
after
we
read
it
though
so
there
no
particular
hurry
about
him
we
leave
him
out
there
for
a
while
to
waste
his
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
let
all
look
around
for
the
i
sure
hope
they
did
get
her
in
that
fracas
they
diffused
the
rays
of
eight
giant
searchlights
into
a
vertical
fan
and
with
it
swept
slowly
through
almost
a
before
anything
was
seen
then
there
was
revealed
a
cluster
of
cylindrical
objects
amid
a
mass
of
wreckage
which
crane
recognized
at
once
the
is
gone
dick
there
is
what
is
left
of
her
and
most
of
her
cargo
of
salt
in
jute
bags
as
he
spoke
a
series
of
green
flashes
played
upon
the
bags
and
seaton
yelled
in
relief
they
got
the
ship
all
right
but
dunark
and
sitar
got
away
still
with
their
salt
the
moved
over
to
the
wreck
and
seaton
relinquishing
the
controls
to
crane
donned
a
vacuum
suit
entered
the
main
and
snapped
on
the
motor
which
sealed
off
the
lock
pumped
the
air
into
a
and
opened
the
outside
door
he
threw
a
light
line
to
the
two
figures
and
pushed
himself
lightly
toward
them
he
then
talked
briefly
to
dunark
in
the
and
handed
the
end
of
the
line
to
sitar
who
held
it
while
the
two
men
explored
the
fragments
of
the
strange
vessel
gathering
up
various
things
of
interest
as
they
came
upon
them
back
in
the
dunark
and
sitar
let
their
pressure
decrease
gradually
to
that
of
the
terrestrial
vessel
and
removed
the
from
their
helmets
again
oh
karfedo
of
earth
we
thank
you
for
our
lives
dunark
began
gasping
for
breath
when
seaton
leaped
to
the
with
a
quick
apology
never
thought
of
the
effect
our
atmospheric
pressure
would
have
on
you
two
we
can
stand
yours
all
right
but
you
pretty
nearly
pass
out
on
ours
there
that
suit
you
better
did
you
throw
out
your
zone
of
force
yes
as
soon
as
i
saw
that
our
screens
were
not
going
to
hold
the
osnomians
labored
breathing
became
normal
as
the
increased
to
a
value
only
a
little
below
that
of
the
dense
atmosphere
of
their
native
planet
i
then
increased
the
power
of
the
screens
to
the
extreme
limit
and
opened
the
zone
for
a
moment
to
see
how
the
screens
would
hold
with
the
added
power
that
instant
was
enough
in
that
period
a
concentrated
beam
such
as
i
had
no
idea
could
ever
be
generated
went
through
the
outer
and
inner
screens
as
though
they
were
not
there
through
the
arenak
of
the
hull
through
the
entire
central
installation
and
through
the
hull
on
the
other
side
sitar
and
i
were
wearing
suits
say
mart
that
one
bet
we
overlooked
it
a
good
idea
too
those
strangers
wore
them
all
the
time
as
regular
equipment
apparently
next
time
we
get
into
a
jam
be
sure
we
do
it
they
might
come
in
handy
excuse
me
dunark
go
ahead
we
had
suits
on
so
as
soon
as
the
ray
was
shut
off
which
was
almost
instantly
i
phoned
the
crew
to
jump
and
we
leaped
out
through
the
hole
in
the
hull
the
air
rushing
out
gave
us
an
impetus
that
carried
us
many
miles
out
into
space
and
it
required
many
hours
for
the
slight
attraction
of
the
mass
here
to
draw
us
back
to
it
we
just
got
back
a
few
minutes
ago
that
is
probably
what
saved
us
as
they
destroyed
our
vessel
with
atomic
bombs
and
hunted
down
the
four
men
of
our
crew
who
stayed
comparatively
close
to
the
scene
they
rayed
you
for
about
an
hour
with
the
most
stupendous
beams
imaginable
no
such
generators
have
ever
been
considered
possible
of
construction
but
could
make
any
impression
upon
you
then
they
shut
off
their
power
and
stood
by
waiting
i
was
looking
at
you
when
you
released
your
zone
one
moment
it
was
there
and
the
next
the
stranger
had
been
cut
in
pieces
the
rest
you
know
we
sure
glad
you
two
got
away
dunark
well
mart
what
say
we
drag
that
guy
in
and
give
him
the
seaton
swung
the
attractors
holding
the
prisoner
until
they
were
in
line
with
the
main
then
reduced
the
power
of
the
repellers
as
he
approached
the
lock
various
controls
were
actuated
and
soon
the
stranger
stood
in
the
control
room
held
immovable
against
one
wall
while
crane
with
a
elephant
gun
stood
against
the
other
perhaps
you
girls
should
go
somewhere
else
suggested
crane
not
on
your
life
protested
dorothy
who
eyes
wide
and
flushed
with
excitement
stood
near
a
door
with
a
heavy
automatic
pistol
in
her
hand
i
would
miss
this
for
a
farm
got
him
solid
declared
seaton
after
a
careful
inspection
of
the
various
attractors
and
repellers
he
had
bearing
upon
the
prisoner
now
let
get
him
out
of
that
suit
no
better
read
his
air
first
temperature
and
pressure
might
analyze
it
too
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
person
of
the
stranger
since
he
was
encased
in
vacuum
armor
but
it
was
plainly
evident
that
he
was
very
short
and
immensely
broad
and
thick
by
means
of
hollow
needles
forced
through
the
material
of
the
suit
seaton
drew
off
a
sample
of
the
atmosphere
within
into
an
orsat
apparatus
while
crane
made
pressure
and
temperature
readings
temperature
one
hundred
ten
degrees
pressure
pounds
about
the
same
as
ours
is
now
that
we
have
stepped
it
up
to
keep
the
osnomians
from
suffering
seaton
soon
reported
that
the
atmosphere
was
quite
similar
to
that
of
the
except
that
it
was
much
higher
in
carbon
dioxide
and
carried
an
extremely
high
percentage
of
water
vapor
he
took
up
a
pair
of
heavy
shears
and
laid
the
suit
open
full
length
on
both
sides
knowing
that
the
powerful
attractors
would
hold
the
stranger
immovable
he
then
wrenched
off
the
helmet
and
cast
the
whole
suit
aside
revealing
the
enemy
officer
clad
in
a
tunic
of
scarlet
silk
he
was
less
than
five
feet
tall
his
legs
were
merely
blocks
fully
as
great
in
diameter
as
they
were
in
length
supporting
a
torso
of
herculean
dimensions
his
arms
were
as
large
as
a
strong
man
thigh
and
hung
almost
to
the
floor
his
astounding
shoulders
fully
a
yard
across
merged
into
and
supported
an
enormous
head
the
being
possessed
recognizable
nose
ears
and
mouth
and
the
great
domed
forehead
and
huge
cranium
bespoke
an
immense
and
a
highly
developed
brain
but
it
was
the
eyes
of
this
strange
creature
that
fixed
and
held
the
attention
large
they
were
and
black
the
dull
opaque
lusterless
black
of
platinum
sponge
the
pupils
were
a
brighter
black
and
in
them
flamed
ruby
lights
pitiless
mocking
cold
plainly
to
be
read
in
those
sinister
depths
were
the
untold
wisdom
of
unthinkable
age
sheer
ruthlessness
mighty
power
and
ferocity
unrelieved
his
baleful
gaze
swept
from
one
member
of
the
party
to
another
and
to
meet
the
glare
of
those
eyes
was
to
receive
a
tangible
physical
blow
it
was
actually
ponderable
force
that
of
embodied
hardness
and
of
ruthlessness
incarnate
generated
in
that
merciless
brain
and
hurled
forth
through
those
stygian
orbs
if
you
do
need
us
for
anything
dick
i
think
peggy
and
i
will
go
upstairs
dorothy
broke
the
long
silence
good
idea
dot
this
is
going
to
be
pretty
to
watch
or
to
do
either
for
that
matter
if
i
stay
here
another
minute
i
see
that
thing
as
long
as
i
live
and
i
might
be
very
goodbye
and
heartless
and
bloodthirsty
osnomian
though
she
was
sitar
had
gone
to
join
the
two
terrestrial
women
i
did
want
to
say
much
before
the
girls
but
i
want
to
check
a
couple
of
ideas
with
you
two
do
you
think
it
a
safe
bet
that
this
bird
reported
back
to
his
headquarters
i
have
been
thinking
that
very
thing
crane
spoke
gravely
and
dunark
nodded
agreement
any
race
capable
of
developing
such
a
vessel
as
this
would
almost
certainly
have
developed
systems
of
communication
in
proportion
that
the
way
i
doped
it
out
and
that
why
i
going
to
read
his
mind
if
i
have
to
burn
out
his
brain
to
do
it
we
got
to
know
how
far
away
from
home
he
is
whether
he
has
turned
in
any
report
about
us
and
all
about
it
also
i
going
to
get
the
plans
power
and
armament
of
their
most
modern
ships
if
he
knows
them
so
that
your
gang
dunark
can
build
us
one
like
them
because
the
next
boat
that
tackles
us
will
be
warned
and
we
wo
be
able
to
take
it
by
surprise
we
wo
stand
a
chance
in
the
with
a
ship
like
theirs
however
we
can
run
or
we
can
fight
if
we
have
to
any
other
ideas
fellows
as
neither
crane
nor
dunark
had
any
other
suggestions
to
offer
seaton
brought
out
the
mechanical
educator
watching
the
creature
eyes
narrowly
as
he
placed
one
headset
over
that
motionless
head
the
captive
sneered
in
pure
contempt
but
when
the
case
was
opened
and
the
array
of
tubes
and
transformers
was
revealed
that
expression
disappeared
and
when
he
added
a
stage
by
cutting
in
a
transformer
and
a
transmitting
tube
seaton
thought
that
he
saw
an
instantaneously
suppressed
flicker
of
doubt
or
fear
that
headset
thing
was
child
play
to
him
but
he
does
like
the
looks
of
this
other
stuff
at
all
i
do
blame
him
a
bit
i
like
to
be
on
the
receiving
end
of
this
myself
i
going
to
put
him
on
the
recorder
and
on
the
visualizer
seaton
continued
as
he
connected
spools
of
wire
and
tape
lamps
and
lenses
in
an
intricate
system
and
donned
a
headset
i
hate
to
have
much
of
that
brain
in
my
own
skull
afraid
i
bite
myself
i
just
going
to
look
on
and
when
i
see
anything
i
want
i
grab
it
and
put
it
into
my
own
brain
starting
off
easy
not
using
the
big
tube
he
closed
several
switches
lights
flashed
and
the
wires
and
tapes
began
to
feed
through
the
magnets
well
i
got
his
language
folks
he
seemed
to
want
me
to
have
it
it
got
a
lot
of
stuff
in
it
that
i
ca
understand
yet
though
so
guess
i
give
him
some
english
he
changed
several
connections
and
the
captive
spoke
in
a
profoundly
deep
bass
voice
you
may
as
well
discontinue
your
attempt
for
you
will
gain
no
information
from
me
that
machine
of
yours
was
out
of
date
with
us
thousands
of
years
ago
save
your
breath
or
talk
sense
said
seaton
coldly
i
gave
you
english
so
that
you
can
give
me
the
information
i
want
you
already
know
what
it
is
when
you
get
ready
to
talk
say
so
or
throw
it
on
the
screen
of
your
own
accord
if
you
do
i
put
on
enough
voltage
to
burn
your
brain
out
remember
i
can
read
your
dead
brain
as
well
as
though
it
were
alive
but
i
want
your
thoughts
as
well
as
your
knowledge
and
i
going
to
have
them
if
you
give
them
voluntarily
i
will
tinker
up
a
lifeboat
that
you
can
navigate
back
to
your
own
world
and
let
you
go
if
you
resist
i
intend
getting
them
anyway
and
you
shall
not
leave
this
vessel
alive
you
may
take
your
choice
you
are
childish
and
that
machine
is
impotent
against
my
will
i
could
have
defied
it
a
hundred
years
ago
when
i
was
barely
a
grown
man
know
you
american
that
we
supermen
of
the
fenachrone
are
as
far
above
any
of
the
other
and
lesser
breeds
of
beings
who
spawn
in
their
millions
in
their
countless
myriads
of
races
upon
the
numberless
planets
of
the
universe
as
you
are
above
the
inert
metal
from
which
this
your
ship
was
built
the
universe
is
ours
and
in
due
course
we
shall
take
it
just
as
in
due
course
i
shall
take
this
vessel
do
your
worst
i
shall
not
speak
the
creature
eyes
flamed
hurling
a
wave
of
hypnotic
command
through
seaton
eyes
and
deep
into
his
brain
seaton
very
senses
reeled
for
an
instant
under
the
impact
of
that
awful
mental
force
but
after
a
short
intensely
bitter
struggle
he
threw
off
the
spell
that
was
close
fellow
but
you
did
quite
ring
the
bell
he
said
grimly
staring
directly
into
those
unholy
eyes
i
may
rate
pretty
low
mentally
but
i
ca
be
hypnotized
into
turning
you
loose
also
i
can
give
you
cards
and
spades
in
certain
other
lines
which
i
am
about
to
demonstrate
being
superman
did
keep
the
rest
of
your
men
from
going
out
in
my
ray
and
being
a
superman
is
going
to
save
your
brain
i
am
not
depending
upon
my
intellectual
or
mental
force
i
got
an
ace
in
the
hole
in
the
shape
of
five
thousand
volts
to
apply
to
the
most
delicate
centers
of
your
brain
start
giving
me
what
i
want
and
start
quick
or
i
tear
it
out
of
you
the
giant
did
not
answer
merely
glared
defiance
and
bitter
hate
take
it
then
seaton
snapped
and
cut
in
the
stage
and
began
turning
dials
and
knobs
exploring
that
strange
mind
for
the
particular
area
in
which
he
was
most
interested
he
soon
found
it
and
cut
in
the
visualizer
the
stereographic
device
in
parallel
with
solon
own
brain
recorder
which
projected
a
picture
into
the
or
dark
space
of
the
cabinet
crane
and
dunark
tense
and
silent
looked
on
in
strained
suspense
as
minute
after
minute
the
silent
battle
of
wills
raged
upon
one
side
was
a
horrible
and
gigantic
brain
of
undreamed
of
power
upon
the
other
side
a
strong
man
fighting
for
all
that
life
holds
dear
wielding
against
that
monstrous
and
frightful
brain
a
weapon
wrought
of
electricity
applied
with
all
the
skill
that
earthly
and
osnomian
science
could
devise
seaton
crouched
over
the
amplifier
his
jaw
set
and
every
muscle
taut
his
eyes
leaping
from
one
meter
to
another
his
right
hand
slowly
turning
up
the
potentiometer
which
was
driving
more
and
ever
more
of
the
searing
torturing
output
of
his
tube
into
that
stubborn
brain
the
captive
was
standing
utterly
rigid
eyes
closed
every
sense
and
faculty
mustered
to
resist
that
cruelly
penetrant
attack
upon
the
very
innermost
recesses
of
his
mind
crane
and
dunark
scarcely
breathed
as
the
picture
in
the
visualizer
varied
from
a
blank
to
the
hazy
outlines
of
a
giant
it
faded
out
as
the
unknown
exerted
himself
to
withstand
that
poignant
inquisition
only
to
come
back
in
clearer
than
before
as
seaton
advanced
the
potentiometer
still
farther
finally
flesh
and
blood
could
no
longer
resist
that
lethal
probe
and
the
picture
became
sharp
and
clear
it
showed
the
captain
for
he
was
no
less
an
officer
than
the
commander
of
the
vessel
at
a
great
council
table
seated
together
with
many
other
officers
upon
very
low
enormously
strong
metal
stools
they
were
receiving
orders
from
their
emperor
orders
plainly
understood
by
crane
and
the
osnomian
alike
for
thought
needs
no
translation
gentlemen
of
the
navy
the
ruler
spoke
solemnly
our
preliminary
expedition
returned
some
time
ago
achieved
its
every
aim
and
we
are
now
ready
to
begin
fulfilling
our
destiny
the
conquest
of
the
universe
this
galaxy
comes
first
our
base
of
operations
will
be
the
largest
planet
of
that
group
of
brilliant
green
suns
for
they
can
be
seen
from
any
point
in
the
galaxy
and
are
almost
in
the
exact
center
of
it
our
astronomers
here
the
captain
thoughts
shifted
briefly
to
an
observatory
far
out
in
space
for
perfect
seeing
and
portrayed
a
reflecting
telescope
with
a
mirror
five
miles
in
diameter
capable
of
penetrating
unimaginable
myriads
of
into
space
have
tabulated
all
the
suns
planets
and
satellites
belonging
to
this
galaxy
and
each
of
you
has
been
given
a
complete
chart
and
assigned
a
certain
area
which
he
is
to
explore
remember
gentlemen
that
this
first
major
expedition
is
to
be
purely
one
of
exploration
the
one
of
conquest
will
set
out
after
you
have
returned
with
complete
information
you
will
each
report
by
torpedo
every
tenth
of
the
year
we
do
not
anticipate
any
serious
difficulty
as
we
are
of
course
the
highest
type
of
life
in
the
universe
nevertheless
in
the
unlikely
event
of
trouble
report
it
we
shall
do
the
rest
in
conclusion
i
warn
you
again
let
no
people
know
that
we
exist
make
no
conquests
and
destroy
all
who
by
any
chance
may
see
you
gentlemen
go
with
power
the
captain
embarked
in
a
small
airboat
and
was
shot
to
his
vessel
he
took
his
station
at
an
immense
control
board
and
the
warship
shot
off
instantly
with
unthinkable
velocity
and
with
not
the
slightest
physical
shock
at
this
point
seaton
made
the
captain
take
them
all
over
the
ship
they
noted
its
construction
its
its
controls
every
minute
detail
of
structure
operation
and
maintenance
was
taken
from
the
captain
mind
and
was
both
recorded
and
visualized
the
journey
seemed
to
be
a
very
long
one
but
finally
the
cluster
of
green
suns
became
visible
and
the
fenachrone
began
to
explore
the
solar
systems
in
the
area
assigned
to
that
particular
vessel
hardly
had
the
survey
started
however
when
the
two
globular
were
detected
and
located
the
captain
stopped
the
ship
briefly
then
attacked
they
watched
the
attack
and
saw
the
destruction
of
the
they
looked
on
while
the
captain
read
the
brain
of
one
of
dunark
crew
gleaning
from
it
all
the
facts
concerning
the
two
and
thought
with
him
that
the
two
absentees
from
the
would
drift
back
in
a
few
hours
and
would
be
disposed
of
in
due
course
they
learned
that
these
things
were
automatically
impressed
upon
the
torpedo
next
to
issue
as
was
every
detail
of
everything
that
happened
in
and
around
the
vessel
they
watched
him
impress
a
thought
of
his
own
upon
the
record
the
inhabitants
of
planet
three
of
sun
six
four
seven
three
pilarone
show
unusual
development
and
may
cause
trouble
as
they
have
already
brought
knowledge
of
the
metal
of
power
and
of
the
impenetrable
shield
to
the
central
system
which
is
to
be
our
base
recommend
volatilization
of
this
planet
by
vessel
sent
on
special
mission
they
saw
the
raying
of
the
they
sensed
him
issue
commands
ray
it
for
a
time
he
will
probably
open
the
shield
for
a
moment
as
the
other
one
did
then
after
a
time
skipped
over
by
the
mind
under
examination
cease
raying
no
use
wasting
power
he
must
open
eventually
as
he
runs
out
of
power
stand
by
and
destroy
him
when
he
opens
the
scene
shifted
the
captain
was
asleep
and
was
awakened
by
an
alarm
gong
only
to
find
himself
floating
in
a
mass
of
wreckage
making
his
way
to
the
fragment
of
his
vessel
containing
the
torpedo
port
he
released
the
messenger
which
flew
with
velocity
back
to
the
capital
city
of
the
fenachrone
carrying
with
it
a
record
of
everything
that
had
happened
that
what
i
want
thought
seaton
those
torpedoes
went
home
fast
i
want
to
know
how
far
they
have
to
go
and
how
long
it
take
them
to
get
there
you
know
what
distance
a
parsec
is
since
it
is
purely
a
mathematical
concept
and
you
must
have
a
watch
or
some
similar
instrument
with
which
we
can
translate
your
years
into
ours
i
want
to
have
to
kill
you
fellow
and
if
you
give
up
even
now
spare
you
i
get
it
anyway
you
know
and
you
also
know
that
a
few
hundred
volts
more
will
kill
you
they
saw
the
thought
received
and
saw
its
answer
you
shall
learn
no
more
this
is
the
most
important
of
all
and
i
shall
hold
it
to
disintegration
and
beyond
seaton
advanced
the
potentiometer
still
farther
and
the
brain
picture
waxed
and
waned
strengthened
and
faded
finally
however
it
was
revealed
by
flashes
that
the
torpedo
had
about
a
hundred
and
thousand
parsecs
to
go
and
that
it
would
take
of
a
year
to
make
the
journey
that
the
warships
which
would
come
in
answer
to
the
message
were
as
fast
as
the
torpedo
that
he
did
indeed
have
in
his
suit
a
watch
a
device
of
seven
dials
each
turning
ten
times
as
fast
as
its
successor
and
that
one
turn
of
the
slowest
dial
measured
one
year
of
his
time
seaton
instantly
threw
off
his
headset
and
opened
the
power
switch
grab
a
stopwatch
quick
mart
he
called
as
he
leaped
to
the
discarded
vacuum
suit
and
searched
out
the
peculiar
timepiece
they
noted
the
exact
time
consumed
by
one
complete
revolution
of
one
of
the
dials
and
calculated
rapidly
better
than
i
thought
exclaimed
seaton
that
makes
his
year
about
four
hundred
ten
of
our
days
that
gives
us
days
before
the
torpedo
gets
there
longer
than
i
dared
hope
we
got
to
fight
too
not
run
they
figure
on
getting
the
then
volatilizing
our
world
well
we
can
take
time
enough
to
grab
off
an
absolutely
complete
record
of
this
guy
brain
we
need
it
for
what
coming
and
going
to
get
it
if
i
have
to
kill
him
to
do
it
he
resumed
his
place
at
the
educator
turned
on
the
power
and
a
shadow
passed
over
his
face
poor
devil
he
conked
out
could
stand
the
gaff
he
remarked
however
that
makes
it
easy
to
get
what
we
want
and
we
have
had
to
kill
him
anyway
i
guess
bad
as
it
is
i
hate
to
bump
him
off
in
cold
blood
he
threaded
new
spools
into
the
machine
and
for
three
hours
mile
after
mile
of
tape
sped
between
the
magnets
as
seaton
explored
every
recess
of
that
monstrous
yet
stupendous
brain
well
that
that
he
declared
finally
as
the
last
bit
of
information
gleaned
and
recorded
upon
the
flying
tape
he
removed
the
body
of
the
fenachrone
captain
into
space
and
rayed
it
out
of
existence
now
what
to
do
how
can
we
get
this
salt
to
osnome
asked
dunark
whose
thoughts
were
never
far
from
that
store
of
the
precious
chemical
you
are
already
crowded
and
sitar
and
i
will
crowd
you
still
more
you
have
no
room
for
additional
cargo
and
yet
much
valuable
time
would
be
lost
in
going
to
osnome
for
another
vessel
yes
and
we
got
to
get
a
lot
of
too
guess
we
have
to
take
time
to
get
another
vessel
i
like
to
drag
in
the
pieces
of
that
ship
too
his
instruments
and
a
lot
of
the
parts
could
be
used
why
not
do
it
all
at
once
suggested
crane
we
can
start
that
whole
mass
toward
osnome
by
drawing
it
behind
us
until
such
a
velocity
has
been
attained
that
it
will
reach
there
at
the
desired
time
we
could
then
go
to
and
overtake
this
material
near
the
green
system
right
you
are
ace
that
a
sound
idea
but
say
dunark
it
be
good
technique
for
you
to
eat
our
food
for
any
length
of
time
while
we
figuring
this
out
you
better
hop
over
there
and
bring
over
enough
to
last
you
two
until
we
get
you
home
give
it
to
shiro
after
a
couple
of
lessons
you
find
he
be
as
good
as
any
of
your
cooks
faster
and
faster
the
flew
pulling
behind
her
the
mass
of
wreckage
held
by
every
available
attractor
when
the
calculated
velocity
had
been
attained
the
attractors
were
shut
off
and
the
vessel
darted
away
toward
that
planet
still
in
the
carboniferous
age
which
possessed
at
least
one
solid
ledge
of
metallic
x
the
rarest
of
all
earthly
metals
as
the
automatic
controls
held
the
cruiser
upon
her
course

sat
long
in
discussion
as
to
what
should
be
done
what
could
be
done
to
avert
the
threatened
destruction
of
all
the
civilization
of
the
galaxy
except
the
monstrous
and
unspeakable
culture
of
the
fenachrone
nearing
their
destination
seaton
rose
to
his
feet
well
folks
it
like
this
we
got
our
backs
to
the
wall
dunark
has
troubles
of
his
own
if
the
third
planet
does
get
him
the
fenachrone
will
and
the
third
planet
is
the
more
pressing
danger
that
lets
him
out
we
got
nearly
six
months
before
the
fenachrone
can
get
back
here
but
how
can
they
possibly
find
us
here
or
wherever
we
be
by
that
time
dick
asked
dorothy
the
battle
was
a
long
way
from
here
with
that
much
start
they
probably
could
find
us
seaton
replied
soberly
it
the
world
i
thinking
about
they
got
to
be
stopped
and
stopped
cold
and
we
got
only
six
months
to
do
it
in
got
the
best
tools
and
the
fastest
workmen
i
know
of
his
voice
died
away
in
thought
that
sort
of
thing
is
in
your
department
dick
crane
was
calm
and
judicial
as
always
i
will
of
course
do
anything
i
can
but
you
probably
have
a
plan
of
campaign
already
laid
out
after
a
fashion
we
got
to
find
out
how
to
work
through
this
zone
of
force
or
we
sunk
without
a
trace
even
with
rays
screens
and
ships
equal
to
theirs
we
could
keep
them
from
sending
a
vessel
to
destroy
the
earth
and
they
probably
get
us
too
eventually
they
got
a
lot
of
stuff
we
do
know
about
of
course
since
i
took
only
one
mind
while
he
was
a
very
able
man
he
did
know
all
that
all
the
rest
of
them
do
any
more
than
any
one
man
has
all
the
earthly
science
known
absolutely
our
only
chance
is
to
control
that
zone
it
the
only
thing
they
have
got
of
course
it
may
be
impossible
but
i
wo
believe
that
until
i
exhausted
a
lot
of
possibilities
dunark
can
you
spare
a
crew
to
build
us
a
duplicate
of
that
fenachrone
ship
besides
those
you
are
going
to
build
for
yourself
certainly
i
will
be
only
too
glad
to
do
so
well
then
while
dunark
is
doing
that
i
suggest
that
we
go
to
this
third
planet
abduct
a
few
of
their
leading
scientists
and
read
their
minds
then
do
the
same
visiting
every
other
highly
advanced
planet
we
can
locate
there
is
a
good
chance
that
by
combining
the
best
points
of
the
warfares
of
many
worlds
we
can
evolve
something
that
will
enable
us
to
turn
back
these
invaders
why
not
send
a
copper
torpedo
to
destroy
their
entire
planet
suggested
dunark
would
work
their
detecting
screens
would
locate
it
a
thousand
million
miles
off
in
space
and
they
would
ray
it
with
a
zone
of
force
that
would
get
through
their
screens
that
would
be
the
first
thing
do
you
see
every
thought
comes
back
to
that
zone
we
got
to
get
through
it
some
way
the
course
alarm
sounded
and
they
saw
that
a
planet
lay
directly
in
their
path
it
was
x
and
enough
negative
acceleration
was
applied
to
make
an
easy
landing
possible
is
it
going
to
be
a
long
slow
job
chopping
off
two
tons
of
that
metal
and
fighting
away
those
terrible
animals
besides
asked
margaret
it
take
about
a
millionth
of
a
second
peg
i
going
to
bite
it
off
with
the
zone
just
as
i
took
that
bite
out
of
our
field
the
rotation
of
the
planet
will
throw
us
away
from
the
surface
then
we
release
the
zone
and
drag
our
prey
off
with
us
see
the
descended
rapidly
toward
that
ledge
of
metal
to
which
the
object
compass
had
led
them
this
is
exactly
where
we
landed
before
margaret
commented
in
surprise
and
dorothy
added
yes
and
there
that
horrible
tree
that
ate
the
dinosaur
or
whatever
it
was
i
thought
you
blew
it
up
for
me
dick
i
did
dottie
blew
it
into
atoms
must
be
a
good
location
for
carnivorous
trees
and
they
must
grow
awfully
fast
too
as
to
its
being
the
same
place
peg
sure
it
is
that
what
object
compasses
are
for
everything
appeared
as
it
had
been
at
the
time
of
their
first
visit
the
rank
carboniferous
vegetation
intensely
vividly
green
was
motionless
in
the
still
hot
heavy
air
the
living
nightmares
inhabiting
that
primitive
world
were
lying
in
the
cooler
depths
of
the
jungle
sheltered
from
the
torrid
rays
of
that
strange
and
fervent
sun
how
about
it
dot
want
to
see
some
of
your
little
friends
again
if
you
do
i
give
them
a
shot
and
bring
them
out
heavens
no
i
saw
them
once
if
i
never
see
them
again
that
will
be
twenty
minutes
too
soon
all
right
we
grab
us
a
piece
of
this
ledge
and
beat
it
seaton
lowered
the
vessel
to
the
ledge
focussed
the
main
anchoring
attractor
upon
it
and
threw
on
the
zone
of
force
almost
immediately
he
released
the
zone
pointed
the
bar
parallel
to
the
compass
bearing
upon
osnome
and
slowly
applied
the
power
how
much
did
you
take
anyway
asked
dunark
in
amazement
it
looks
bigger
than
the
it
is
considerably
bigger
thought
we
might
as
well
take
enough
while
we
here
so
i
set
the
zone
for
a
radius
probably
of
the
order
of
magnitude
of
half
a
million
tons
since
the
stuff
weighs
more
than
half
a
ton
to
the
cubic
foot
however
we
can
handle
it
as
easily
as
we
could
a
smaller
bite
and
that
much
mass
will
help
us
hold
that
other
stuff
together
when
we
catch
up
with
it
the
voyage
to
osnome
was
uneventful
they
overtook
the
wreckage
true
to
schedule
as
they
were
approaching
the
green
system
and
attached
it
to
the
mass
of
metal
behind
them
by
means
of
attractors
where
we
land
this
junk
dunark
asked
seaton
as
osnome
grew
large
beneath
them
we
hold
this
lump
of
metal
and
the
fragment
of
the
ship
carrying
the
salt
and
we
be
able
to
hold
some
of
the
most
important
of
the
other
stuff
but
a
lot
of
it
is
bound
to
get
away
from
us
and
the
lord
help
anybody
who
under
it
when
it
comes
down
you
might
yell
for
help
and
say
you
might
ask
somebody
to
have
that
astronomical
data
ready
for
us
as
soon
as
we
land
the
parade
ground
will
be
empty
now
so
we
will
land
there
dunark
replied
we
should
be
able
to
land
everything
in
a
field
of
that
size
i
should
think
he
touched
the
sender
at
his
belt
and
in
the
general
code
notified
the
city
of
their
arrival
and
warned
everyone
to
keep
away
from
the
parade
ground
he
then
sent
several
messages
in
the
official
code
concluding
by
asking
that
one
or
two
come
out
and
help
lower
the
burden
to
the
ground
as
the
peculiar
pulsating
chatter
of
the
osnomian
telegraph
died
out
seaton
called
for
help
come
here
you
two
and
grab
some
of
these
attractors
i
need
about
twelve
hands
to
keep
this
plunder
in
the
straight
and
narrow
path
the
course
had
been
carefully
laid
with
allowance
for
the
various
velocities
and
forces
involved
to
follow
the
easiest
path
to
the
kondalian
parade
ground
the
hemisphere
of
x
and
the
fragment
of
the
which
bore
the
salt
were
held
immovably
in
place
by
the
main
attractor
and
one
auxiliary
and
many
other
auxiliaries
held
sections
of
the
fenachrone
vessel
however
the
resistance
of
the
air
seriously
affected
the
trajectory
of
many
of
the
irregularly
shaped
smaller
masses
of
metal
and
all
three
men
were
kept
busy
flicking
attractors
right
and
left
capturing
those
strays
which
threatened
to
veer
off
into
the
streets
or
upon
the
buildings
of
the
kondalian
capital
city
and
shifting
from
one
piece
to
another
so
that
none
should
fall
freely
two
of
the
appeared
as
if
by
magic
in
answer
to
dunark
call
and
their
attractors
aided
greatly
in
handling
the
unruly
collection
of
wreckage
a
few
of
the
smaller
sections
and
a
shower
of
debris
fell
clear
however
in
spite
of
all
efforts
and
their
approach
was
heralded
by
a
meteoric
display
unprecedented
in
that
world
of
continuous
daylight
as
the
three
vessels
with
their
cumbersome
convoy
dropped
down
into
the
lower
atmosphere
the
guns
of
the
city
roared
a
welcome
banners
and
pennons
waved
the
air
became
riotous
with
color
from
hundreds
of
projectors
and
odorous
with
a
bewildering
variety
of
scents
while
all
around
them
played
numberless
aircraft
of
all
descriptions
and
sizes
the
space
below
them
was
carefully
avoided
but
on
all
sides
and
above
them
the
air
was
so
full
that
it
seemed
marvelous
that
no
collision
occurred
tiny
helicopters
little
more
than
single
chairs
flying
about
beautiful
soaring
and
wheeling
immense
multiplane
liners
and
giant
helicopter
freighters
everything
in
the
air
found
occasion
to
fly
as
near
as
possible
to
the
skylark
in
order
to
dip
their
flags
in
salute
to
dunark
their
kofedix
and
to
seaton
the
wearer
of
the
seven
disks
their
revered
overlord
finally
the
freight
was
landed
without
serious
mishap
and
the
leaped
to
the
landing
dock
upon
the
palace
roof
where
the
royal
family
and
many
nobles
were
waiting
in
full
panoply
of
glittering
harness
dunark
and
sitar
disembarked
and
the
four
others
stepped
out
and
stood
at
attention
as
seaton
addressed
roban
the
karfedix
sir
we
greet
you
but
we
can
not
stop
even
for
a
moment
you
know
that
only
the
most
urgent
necessity
would
make
us
forego
the
pleasure
of
a
brief
rest
beneath
your
roof
the
kofedix
will
presently
give
you
the
measure
of
that
dire
need
we
shall
endeavor
to
return
soon
greetings
and
for
a
time
farewell
overlord
we
greet
you
and
trust
that
soon
we
may
entertain
you
and
profit
from
your
companionship
for
what
you
have
done
we
thank
you
may
the
great
first
cause
smile
upon
you
until
your
return
farewell
chapter
vi
the
peace
conference
here
a
chart
of
the
green
system
mart
with
all
the
motions
and
the
rest
of
the
dope
that
they
been
able
to
get
how
it
be
for
you
to
navigate
us
over
to
the
third
planet
of
the
fourteenth
sun
while
you
build
a
fenachrone
right
the
first
time
your
deducer
is
hitting
on
all
eight
as
usual
that
big
ray
is
hot
stuff
and
their
is
something
to
write
home
about
too
how
can
their
rays
be
any
hotter
than
ours
dick
dorothy
asked
curiously
i
thought
you
said
we
had
the
very
last
word
in
rays
i
thought
we
had
but
those
birds
we
met
back
there
spoke
a
couple
of
later
words
their
rays
work
on
an
entirely
different
system
than
the
one
we
use
they
generate
an
extremely
short
carrier
wave
like
the
millikan
cosmic
ray
by
recombining
some
of
the
electrons
and
protons
of
their
disintegrating
metal
and
upon
this
wave
they
impose
a
pure
heat
frequency
of
terrific
power
the
millikan
rays
will
penetrate
anything
except
a
special
ray
screen
or
a
zone
of
force
and
carry
with
them
somewhat
as
radio
frequencies
carry
sound
frequencies
the
heat
rays
which
volatilize
anything
they
touch
their
ray
screens
are
a
lot
better
than
ours
too
they
generate
the
entire
spectrum
it
a
sweet
system
and
when
we
revamp
ours
so
as
to
be
just
like
it
we
be
able
to
talk
turkey
to
those
folks
on
the
third
planet
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
build
it
asked
crane
who
dexterously
turning
the
pages
of
vega
handbuch
was
calculating
their
course
a
day
or
so
maybe
less
i
got
all
the
stuff
and
with
my
osnomian
tools
it
wo
take
long
if
you
find
you
get
there
before
i
get
done
you
have
to
loaf
a
while
kill
a
little
time
are
you
going
to
connect
the
power
plant
to
operate
on
the
entire
vessel
and
all
its
contents
no
ca
do
it
without
redesigning
the
whole
thing
and
that
hardly
worth
while
for
the
short
time
we
use
this
old
bus
building
those
generators
would
have
been
a
long
and
difficult
task
for
a
corps
of
earthly
mechanics
and
electricians
but
to
seaton
it
was
merely
a
job
the
shop
had
been
enlarged
and
had
been
filled
to
capacity
with
osnomian
machinery
machine
tools
that
were
capable
of
performing
automatically
and
with
the
utmost
precision
and
speed
any
conceivable
mechanical
operation
he
put
a
dozen
of
them
to
work
and
before
the
vessel
reached
its
destination
the
new
offensive
and
defensive
weapons
had
been
installed
and
thoroughly
tested
he
had
added
a
third
so
that
now
in
addition
to
the
hull
of
arenak
and
the
repellers
warding
off
any
material
projectile
the
skylark
was
also
protected
by
an
outer
an
intermediate
and
an
inner
each
driven
by
the
of
a
bar
and
each
covering
the
entire
spectrum
capable
of
neutralizing
any
dangerous
frequency
known
to
those
the
fenachrone
as
the
approached
the
planet
seaton
swung
number
six
visiplate
upon
it
and
directed
their
flight
toward
a
great
army
base
darting
down
upon
it
he
snatched
an
officer
into
the
airlock
closed
the
door
and
leaped
back
into
space
he
brought
the
captive
into
the
control
room
pinioned
by
auxiliary
attractors
and
relieved
him
of
his
weapons
he
then
rapidly
read
his
mind
encountering
no
noticeable
resistance
released
the
attractors
and
addressed
him
in
his
own
language
please
be
seated
lieutenant
seaton
said
courteously
motioning
him
to
one
of
the
seats
we
come
in
peace
please
pardon
my
discourtesy
in
handling
you
but
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
learn
your
language
and
thus
to
get
in
touch
with
your
commanding
officer
the
officer
overcome
with
astonishment
that
he
had
not
been
killed
instantly
sank
into
the
seat
indicated
without
a
reply
and
seaton
went
on
please
be
kind
enough
to
signal
your
commanding
officer
that
we
are
coming
down
at
once
for
a
peace
conference
by
the
way
i
can
read
your
signals
and
will
send
them
myself
if
necessary
the
stranger
worked
an
instrument
attached
to
his
harness
briefly
and
the
descended
slowly
toward
the
fortress
i
know
of
course
that
your
vessels
will
attack
seaton
remarked
as
he
noted
a
crafty
gleam
in
the
eyes
of
the
officer
i
intend
to
let
them
use
all
their
power
for
a
time
to
prove
to
them
the
impotence
of
their
weapons
after
that
i
shall
tell
you
what
to
say
to
them
do
you
think
this
is
altogether
safe
dick
asked
crane
as
they
saw
a
fleet
of
gigantic
airships
soaring
upward
to
meet
them
nothing
sure
but
death
and
taxes
returned
seaton
cheerfully
but
do
forget
that
we
got
fenachrone
armament
now
instead
of
osnomian
i
betting
that
they
ca
begin
to
drive
their
rays
through
even
our
outer
screen
and
even
if
our
outer
screen
should
begin
to
go
into
the
violet
i
do
think
it
will
even
go
out
goes
our
zone
of
force
and
we
automatically
go
up
where
no
possible
airship
can
reach
since
their
only
are
rocket
driven
and
of
practically
no
maneuverability
they
stand
a
big
chance
of
getting
to
us
anyway
we
must
get
in
touch
with
them
to
find
out
if
they
know
anything
we
do
and
this
is
the
only
way
i
know
of
to
do
it
besides
i
want
to
head
dunark
off
from
wrecking
this
world
they
exactly
the
same
kind
of
folks
he
is
you
notice
and
i
do
like
civil
war
any
suggestions
keep
an
eye
on
that
bird
then
mart
and
we
go
down
the
dropped
down
into
the
midst
of
the
fleet
which
instantly
turned
against
her
the
full
force
of
their
giant
guns
and
their
immense
ray
batteries
seaton
held
the
motionless
staring
into
his
visiplate
his
right
hand
grasping
the
the
outer
screen
is
even
getting
warm
he
exulted
after
a
moment
the
repellers
were
hurling
the
shells
back
long
before
they
reached
even
the
outer
screen
and
they
were
exploding
harmlessly
in
the
air
the
full
power
of
the
too
which
had
been
so
destructive
to
the
osnomian
defenses
were
only
sufficient
to
bring
the
outer
screen
to
a
dull
red
glow
after
fifteen
minutes
of
passive
acceptance
of
all
the
airships
could
do
seaton
spoke
to
the
captive
sir
please
signal
the
commanding
officer
of
vessel
that
i
am
going
to
cut
it
in
two
in
the
middle
have
him
remove
all
men
in
that
part
of
the
ship
to
the
ends
and
have
parachutes
in
readiness
as
i
do
not
wish
to
cause
any
loss
of
life
the
signal
was
sent
and
as
the
officer
was
already
daunted
by
the
fact
that
their
utmost
efforts
could
not
even
make
the
strangers
screens
radiate
it
was
obeyed
seaton
then
threw
on
the
frightful
power
of
the
fenachrone
the
defensive
screens
of
the
doomed
warship
flashed
once
a
sparkling
coruscating
display
of
incandescent
brilliance
and
in
the
same
instant
went
down
simultaneously
the
entire
midsection
of
the
vessel
exploded
into
light
and
disappeared
completely
volatilized
sir
please
signal
the
entire
fleet
to
cease
action
and
to
follow
me
down
if
they
do
not
do
so
i
will
destroy
the
rest
of
them
the
dropped
to
the
ground
followed
by
the
fleet
of
warships
who
settled
in
a
ring
about
her
inactive
but
ready
will
you
please
loan
me
your
sending
instrument
sir
seaton
asked
from
this
point
on
i
can
carry
on
negotiations
better
direct
than
through
you
the
lieutenant
found
his
voice
as
he
surrendered
the
instrument
sir
are
you
the
overlord
of
osnome
of
whom
we
have
heard
we
had
supposed
that
one
was
a
mythical
character
but
you
must
be
he
no
one
else
would
spare
lives
that
he
could
take
and
the
overlord
is
the
only
being
reputed
to
have
a
skin
the
color
of
yours
yes
lieutenant
i
am
the
overlord
and
i
have
decided
to
become
the
overlord
of
the
entire
green
system
as
well
as
of
osnome
he
then
sent
out
a
call
to
the
of
all
the
armies
of
the
planet
informing
him
that
he
was
coming
to
visit
him
at
once
and
the
tore
through
the
air
to
the
capital
city
no
sooner
had
the
earthly
vessel
alighted
upon
the
palace
grounds
than
she
was
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
warships
who
however
made
no
offensive
move
seaton
again
used
the
telegraph
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
planet
urvania
greetings
from
the
overlord
of
this
solar
system
i
invite
you
to
come
into
my
vessel
unarmed
and
alone
for
a
conference
i
come
in
peace
and
peace
or
war
as
you
decide
no
harm
shall
come
to
you
until
after
you
have
returned
to
your
own
command
think
well
before
you
reply
if
i
refuse
i
shall
destroy
one
of
the
vessels
surrounding
me
and
shall
continue
to
destroy
them
one
every
ten
seconds
until
you
agree
to
come
if
you
still
do
not
agree
i
shall
destroy
all
the
armed
forces
upon
this
planet
then
destroy
all
your
people
who
are
at
present
upon
osnome
i
wish
to
avoid
bloodshed
and
destruction
but
i
can
and
i
will
do
as
i
have
said
i
will
come
the
general
came
out
upon
the
field
unarmed
escorted
by
a
company
of
soldiers
a
hundred
feet
from
the
vessel
he
halted
the
guards
and
came
on
alone
erect
and
soldierly
seaton
met
him
at
the
door
and
invited
him
to
be
seated
what
can
you
have
to
say
to
me
the
general
demanded
disregarding
the
invitation
many
things
first
let
me
say
that
you
are
not
only
a
brave
man
you
are
a
wise
general
your
visit
to
me
proves
it
it
is
a
sign
of
weakness
but
i
believed
when
i
heard
those
reports
and
still
believe
that
a
refusal
would
have
resulted
in
a
heavy
loss
of
our
men
was
the
general
reply
it
would
have
said
seaton
i
repeat
that
your
act
was
not
weakness
but
wisdom
the
second
thing
i
have
to
say
is
that
i
had
not
planned
on
taking
any
active
part
in
the
management
of
things
either
upon
osnome
or
upon
this
planet
until
i
learned
of
a
catastrophe
that
is
threatening
all
the
civilization
in
this
galaxy
thus
threatening
my
own
distant
world
as
well
as
those
of
this
solar
system
third
only
by
superior
force
can
i
make
either
your
race
or
the
osnomians
listen
to
reason
sufficiently
to
unite
against
a
common
foe
you
have
been
reared
in
unreasoning
hatred
for
so
many
generations
that
your
minds
are
warped
for
that
reason
i
have
assumed
control
of
this
entire
system
and
shall
give
you
your
choice
between
with
us
or
being
rendered
incapable
of
molesting
us
while
our
attention
is
occupied
by
this
threatened
invasion
we
will
have
no
traffic
with
the
enemy
whatever
said
the
general
this
is
final
you
just
think
so
here
is
a
mathematical
statement
of
what
is
going
to
happen
to
your
world
unless
i
intervene
he
handed
the
general
a
drawing
of
dunark
plan
and
described
it
in
detail
that
is
the
answer
of
the
osnomians
to
your
invasion
of
their
planet
i
do
not
want
this
world
destroyed
but
if
you
refuse
to
make
common
cause
with
us
against
a
common
foe
it
may
be
necessary
have
you
forces
at
your
command
sufficient
to
frustrate
this
plan
no
but
i
can
not
really
believe
that
such
a
deflection
of
celestial
bodies
is
possible
possible
or
not
you
realize
that
i
could
not
yield
to
empty
threats
of
course
not
said
seaton
but
you
were
wise
enough
to
refuse
to
sacrifice
a
few
ships
and
men
in
a
useless
struggle
against
my
overwhelming
armament
therefore
you
are
certainly
wise
enough
to
refuse
to
sacrifice
your
entire
race
however
before
you
come
to
any
definite
conclusion
i
will
show
you
what
threatens
the
galaxy
he
handed
the
other
a
headset
and
ran
through
the
section
of
the
record
showing
the
plans
of
the
invaders
he
then
ran
a
few
sections
showing
the
irresistible
power
at
the
command
of
the
fenachrone
that
is
what
awaits
us
all
unless
we
combine
against
them
what
are
your
requirements
the
general
asked
i
request
immediate
withdrawal
of
all
your
armed
forces
now
upon
osnome
and
full
with
me
in
this
coming
war
against
the
invaders
in
return
i
will
give
you
the
secrets
i
have
just
given
the
osnomians
the
power
and
the
offensive
and
defensive
weapons
of
this
vessel
the
osnomians
are
now
building
vessels
such
as
this
one
asked
the
general
they
are
building
vessels
a
hundred
times
the
size
of
this
one
with
the
same
armament
for
myself
i
would
agree
to
your
terms
however
the
word
of
the
emperor
is
law
i
understand
replied
seaton
would
you
be
willing
to
seek
an
immediate
audience
with
him
i
would
suggest
that
both
you
and
he
accompany
me
and
we
shall
hold
a
peace
conference
with
the
osnomian
emperor
and
upon
this
vessel
we
shall
be
gone
less
than
a
day
i
shall
do
so
at
once
you
may
accompany
your
general
lieutenant
again
i
ask
pardon
for
my
necessary
rudeness
as
the
urvanian
officers
hurried
toward
the
palace
the
other
terrestrials
who
had
been
listening
in
from
another
room
entered
it
sounded
as
though
you
convinced
him
dick
but
that
language
is
nothing
like
kondalian
why
do
you
teach
it
to
us
teach
it
to
shiro
too
so
he
can
cook
for
and
talk
to
our
distinguished
guests
intelligently
if
they
going
back
with
us
as
he
connected
up
the
educator
seaton
explained
what
had
happened
and
concluded
i
want
to
stop
this
civil
war
keep
dunark
from
destroying
this
planet
preserve
osnome
for
osnomians
and
make
them
all
with
us
against
the
fenachrone
that
one
tall
order
since
these
folks
the
remotest
notion
of
anything
except
killing
a
company
of
soldiers
approached
and
dorothy
got
up
hastily
stick
around
folks
we
can
all
talk
to
them
i
believe
that
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
be
alone
crane
decided
after
a
moment
thought
they
are
used
to
autocratic
power
and
can
understand
nothing
but
control
the
girls
and
i
will
keep
out
of
it
that
might
be
better
at
that
and
seaton
went
to
the
door
to
welcome
the
guests
seaton
instructed
them
to
lie
flat
and
put
on
all
the
acceleration
they
could
bear
it
was
not
long
until
they
were
back
in
kondal
where
roban
the
karfedix
and
tarnan
the
karbix
accepted
seaton
invitation
and
entered
the
skylark
unarmed
back
out
in
space
the
vessel
stationary
seaton
introduced
the
emperors
and
to
each
other
introductions
which
were
acknowledged
almost
imperceptibly
he
then
gave
each
a
headset
and
ran
the
complete
record
of
the
fenachrone
brain
stop
shouted
roban
after
only
a
moment
would
you
the
overlord
of
osnome
reveal
such
secrets
as
this
to
the
of
osnome
i
would
i
have
taken
over
the
overlordship
of
the
entire
green
system
for
the
duration
of
this
emergency
and
i
do
not
want
two
of
its
planets
engaged
in
civil
war
the
record
finished
seaton
tried
for
some
time
to
bring
the
four
green
warriors
to
his
way
of
thinking
but
in
vain
roban
and
tarnan
remained
contemptuous
they
would
have
thrown
themselves
upon
him
but
for
the
knowledge
that
no
fifty
unarmed
men
of
the
green
race
could
have
overcome
his
strength
to
them
supernatural
the
two
urvanians
were
equally
obdurate
this
soft
had
given
them
everything
they
had
given
him
nothing
and
would
give
him
nothing
finally
seaton
rose
to
his
full
height
and
stared
at
them
in
turn
wrath
and
determination
blazing
in
his
eyes
i
have
brought
you
four
together
here
in
a
neutral
vessel
in
neutral
space
to
bring
about
peace
between
you
i
have
shown
you
the
benefits
to
be
derived
from
the
peaceful
pursuit
of
science
knowledge
and
power
instead
of
continuing
this
utter
economic
waste
of
continual
war
you
all
close
your
senses
to
reason
you
of
osnome
accuse
me
of
being
an
ingrate
and
a
traitor
you
of
urvania
consider
me
a
sentimental
weakling
who
may
safely
be
disregarded
all
because
i
think
the
welfare
of
the
numberless
peoples
of
the
universe
more
important
than
your
stubborn
selfish
vanity
think
what
you
please
if
brute
force
is
your
only
logic
know
now
that
i
can
and
will
use
brute
force
here
are
the
seven
disks
and
he
placed
the
bracelet
upon
roban
knee
if
you
four
leaders
are
enough
to
place
your
petty
enmity
before
the
good
of
all
civilization
i
am
done
with
you
forever
i
have
deliberately
given
urvanians
precisely
the
same
information
that
i
have
given
the
osnomians
no
more
and
no
less
i
have
given
neither
of
you
all
that
i
know
and
i
shall
know
much
more
than
i
do
now
before
the
time
of
the
conquest
shall
have
arrived
unless
you
four
men
here
and
now
renounce
this
war
and
agree
to
a
perpetual
peace
between
your
worlds
i
shall
leave
you
to
your
mutual
destruction
you
do
not
yet
realize
the
power
of
the
weapons
i
have
given
you
when
you
do
realize
it
you
will
know
that
mutual
destruction
is
inevitable
if
you
continue
this
internecine
war
i
shall
continue
upon
other
worlds
my
search
for
the
one
secret
standing
between
me
and
a
complete
mastery
of
power
that
i
shall
find
that
secret
i
am
confident
and
having
found
it
i
shall
without
your
aid
destroy
the
fenachrone
you
have
several
times
remarked
with
sneers
that
you
are
not
to
be
swayed
by
empty
threats
what
i
am
about
to
say
is
no
empty
threat
it
is
a
most
solemn
promise
given
by
one
who
has
both
the
will
and
the
power
to
fulfill
his
every
given
word
now
listen
carefully
to
this
my
final
utterance
if
you
continue
this
warfare
and
if
the
victor
should
not
be
utterly
destroyed
in
its
course
i
swear
as
i
stand
here
by
the
great
first
cause
that
i
shall
myself
wipe
out
every
trace
of
the
surviving
nation
as
soon
as
the
fenachrone
shall
have
been
obliterated
work
with
each
other
and
me
and
we
all
may
live
fight
on
and
both
your
nations
to
the
last
person
will
most
certainly
die
decide
now
which
it
is
to
be
i
have
spoken
roban
took
up
the
bracelet
and
clasped
it
again
about
seaton
arm
saying
you
are
more
than
ever
our
overlord
you
are
wiser
than
are
we
and
stronger
issue
your
commands
and
they
shall
be
obeyed
why
did
not
you
say
those
things
first
overlord
asked
the
urvanian
emperor
as
he
saluted
and
smiled
we
could
not
in
honor
submit
to
a
weakling
no
matter
what
the
fate
in
store
having
convinced
us
of
your
strength
there
can
be
no
disgrace
in
fighting
beneath
your
screens
an
armlet
of
seven
symbols
shall
be
cast
and
ready
for
you
when
you
next
visit
us
roban
of
osnome
you
are
my
brother
the
two
emperors
saluted
each
other
and
stared
eye
to
eye
for
a
long
moment
and
seaton
knew
that
the
perpetual
peace
had
been
signed
then
all
four
spoke
in
unison
overlord
we
await
your
commands
dunark
of
osnome
is
already
informed
as
to
what
osnome
is
to
do
say
to
him
that
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
him
to
build
the
vessel
for
me
the
urvanians
will
do
that
urvan
of
urvania
you
will
accompany
roban
to
osnome
where
you
two
will
order
instant
cessation
of
hostilities
osnome
has
many
ships
of
this
type
and
upon
some
of
them
you
will
return
your
every
soldier
and
engine
of
war
to
your
own
planet
as
soon
as
possible
you
will
build
for
me
a
vessel
like
that
of
the
fenachrone
except
that
it
shall
be
ten
times
as
large
in
every
dimension
and
except
that
every
instrument
control
and
weapon
is
to
be
left
out
left
out
it
shall
be
so
built
but
of
what
use
will
it
be
the
empty
spaces
shall
be
filled
after
i
have
returned
from
my
quest
you
will
build
this
vessel
of
dagal
you
will
also
instruct
the
osnomian
commander
in
the
manufacture
of
that
metal
which
is
so
much
more
resistant
than
their
arenak
but
overlord
we
have
i
have
just
brought
immense
stores
of
the
precious
chemical
and
of
the
metal
of
power
to
osnome
they
will
share
it
with
you
i
also
advise
you
to
build
for
yourselves
many
ships
like
those
of
the
fenachrone
with
which
to
do
battle
with
the
invaders
in
case
i
should
fail
in
my
quest
you
will
of
course
see
to
it
that
there
will
be
a
corps
of
your
most
efficient
mechanics
and
artisans
within
call
at
all
times
in
case
i
should
return
and
have
sudden
need
for
them
all
these
things
shall
be
done
the
conference
ended
the
four
nobles
were
quickly
landed
upon
osnome
and
once
more
the
traveled
out
into
her
element
the
total
vacuum
and
absolute
zero
of
the
outer
void
with
crane
at
the
controls
you
certainly
sounded
savage
dick
i
almost
thought
you
really
meant
it
dorothy
chuckled
i
did
mean
it
dot
those
fellows
are
mighty
keen
on
detecting
bluffs
if
i
had
meant
it
and
if
they
had
known
that
i
meant
it
never
have
got
away
with
it
but
you
have
meant
it
dick
you
would
have
destroyed
the
osnomians
surely
you
know
you
would
no
but
i
would
have
destroyed
what
was
left
of
the
urvanians
and
all
five
of
us
knew
exactly
how
it
would
have
turned
out
and
exactly
what
i
would
have
done
about
it
that
why
they
all
pulled
in
their
horns
i
do
know
what
would
have
happened
interjected
margaret
what
would
have
with
this
new
stuff
the
urvanians
would
have
wiped
the
osnomians
out
they
are
an
older
race
and
so
much
better
in
science
and
mechanics
that
the
osnomians
would
have
stood
much
chance
and
knew
it
incidentally
that
why
i
having
them
build
our
new
ship
they
put
a
lot
of
stuff
into
it
that
dunark
men
would
miss
maybe
some
stuff
that
even
the
fenachrone
have
got
however
though
it
might
seem
that
the
urvanians
had
all
the
best
of
it
urvan
knew
that
i
had
something
up
my
sleeve
besides
my
bare
arm
and
he
knew
that
i
clean
up
what
there
was
left
of
his
race
if
they
polished
off
the
osnomians
what
a
frightful
chance
you
were
taking
dick
gasped
dorothy
you
have
to
be
hard
to
handle
those
folks
and
believe
me
i
was
a
egg
right
then
they
have
such
a
peculiar
mental
and
moral
slant
that
we
can
hardly
understand
them
at
all
this
idea
of
is
so
new
to
them
that
it
actually
dazed
all
four
of
them
even
to
consider
it
do
you
suppose
they
will
fight
anyway
asked
crane
absolutely
not
both
nations
have
an
inflexible
code
of
honor
such
as
it
is
and
lying
is
against
both
codes
that
one
thing
i
like
about
them
i
sort
of
honest
myself
and
with
either
of
these
races
you
need
nothing
signed
or
guaranteed
what
next
dick
now
the
real
trouble
begins
mart
oil
up
the
massive
old
intellect
have
you
found
the
answer
to
the
problem
what
problem
asked
dorothy
you
did
tell
us
anything
about
a
problem
no
i
told
mart
i
want
the
best
physicist
in
this
entire
solar
system
and
since
there
are
only
one
hundred
and
planets
around
these
seventeen
suns
it
should
be
simple
to
yon
phenomenal
brain
in
fact
i
expect
to
hear
him
say
my
dear
watson
elementary
hardly
that
dick
but
i
have
found
out
a
few
things
there
are
some
eighty
planets
which
are
probably
habitable
for
beings
like
us
other
things
being
equal
it
seems
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
older
the
sun
the
longer
its
planets
have
been
habitable
and
therefore
the
older
and
more
intelligent
the
life
ha
it
was
elementary
says
sherlock
seaton
interrupted
you
heading
directly
at
that
largest
oldest
and
most
intelligent
planet
then
i
take
it
where
i
can
catch
me
my
physicist
not
directly
at
it
no
i
am
heading
for
the
place
where
it
will
be
when
we
reach
it
that
is
elementary
ouch
that
got
to
me
mart
right
where
i
live
i
be
good
but
you
are
getting
ahead
of
me
dick
it
is
not
as
simple
as
you
have
assumed
from
what
i
have
said
so
far
the
osnomian
astronomers
have
done
wonders
in
the
short
time
they
have
had
but
their
data
particularly
on
the
planets
of
the
outer
suns
is
as
yet
necessarily
very
incomplete
since
the
furthermost
outer
sun
is
probably
the
oldest
it
is
the
one
in
which
we
are
most
interested
it
has
seven
planets
four
of
which
are
probably
habitable
as
far
as
temperature
and
atmosphere
are
concerned
however
nothing
exact
is
yet
known
of
their
masses
motions
or
places
therefore
i
have
laid
our
course
to
intercept
the
closest
one
to
us
as
nearly
as
i
can
from
what
meager
data
we
have
if
it
should
prove
to
be
inhabited
by
intelligent
beings
they
can
probably
give
us
more
exact
information
concerning
their
neighboring
planets
that
is
the
best
i
can
do
that
a
darn
fine
best
old
top
narrowing
down
to
four
from
a
hundred
and
well
until
we
get
there
what
to
do
let
sing
us
a
song
to
keep
our
fearless
quartette
in
good
voice
before
you
do
anything
said
margaret
seriously
i
would
like
to
know
if
you
really
think
there
is
a
chance
of
defeating
those
monsters
in
all
seriousness
i
do
in
fact
i
am
quite
confident
of
it
if
we
had
two
years
i
know
that
we
could
lick
them
cold
and
by
stepping
on
the
gas
i
believe
we
can
get
the
dope
in
less
than
the
six
months
we
have
to
work
in
i
know
that
you
are
serious
dick
now
you
know
that
i
do
not
want
to
discourage
any
one
but
i
can
see
small
basis
for
optimism
crane
spoke
slowly
and
thoughtfully
i
hope
that
you
will
be
able
to
control
the
zone
of
force
but
you
are
not
studying
it
yourself
you
seem
to
be
certain
that
somewhere
in
this
system
there
is
a
race
who
already
knows
all
about
it
i
would
like
to
know
your
reasons
for
thinking
that
such
a
race
exists
they
may
not
be
upon
this
system
they
may
have
been
outsiders
as
we
are
but
i
have
reasons
for
believing
them
to
be
natives
of
this
system
since
they
were
green
you
are
as
familiar
with
osnomian
mythology
as
i
am
you
girls
in
particular
have
read
osnomian
legends
to
osnomian
children
for
hours
also
identically
the
same
legends
prevail
upon
urvania
i
read
them
in
that
lieutenant
brain
in
fact
i
looked
for
them
you
also
know
that
every
has
some
basis
however
tenuous
in
fact
now
dottie
tell
about
the
battle
of
the
gods
when
osnome
was
a
pup
the
gods
came
down
from
the
sky
dorothy
recited
they
were
green
as
were
men
they
wore
invisible
armor
of
polished
metal
which
appeared
and
disappeared
they
stayed
inside
the
armor
and
fought
outside
it
with
swords
and
lances
of
fire
men
who
fought
against
them
cut
them
through
and
through
with
swords
and
they
struck
the
men
with
lances
of
flame
so
that
they
were
stunned
so
the
gods
fought
in
days
long
gone
and
vanished
in
their
invisible
armor
and
that
enough
interrupted
seaton
the
little
girl
has
her
lesson
perfectly
get
it
mart
no
i
can
not
say
that
i
do
why
it
does
even
make
sense
exclaimed
margaret
all
right
i
elucidate
listen
and
seaton
voice
grew
tense
with
earnestness
visitors
came
down
out
of
space
they
were
green
they
wore
zones
of
force
which
they
flashed
on
and
off
they
stayed
inside
the
zones
and
projected
their
images
outside
and
used
rays
the
men
who
fought
against
the
images
cut
them
through
and
through
with
swords
but
could
not
harm
them
since
they
were
not
actual
substance
and
the
images
directed
rays
against
the
men
so
that
they
were
stunned
so
the
visitors
fought
in
days
long
gone
and
vanished
in
their
zones
of
force
how
does
that
sound
you
have
the
most
stupendous
imagination
the
world
has
ever
seen
but
there
may
be
some
slight
basis
of
fact
there
after
all
said
crane
slowly
i
convinced
of
it
for
one
reason
in
particular
notice
that
it
says
specifically
that
the
visitors
stunned
the
natives
now
that
thought
is
absolutely
foreign
to
all
osnomian
nature
when
they
strike
they
kill
and
always
have
now
if
that
myth
has
come
down
through
so
many
generations
without
having
that
changed
to
willing
to
bet
a
few
weeks
of
time
that
the
rest
of
it
came
down
fairly
straight
too
of
course
what
they
had
may
not
have
been
the
zone
of
force
as
we
know
it
but
it
must
have
been
a
ray
of
some
kind
and
believe
me
that
was
one
educated
ray
somebody
sure
had
something
even
back
in
those
days
and
if
they
had
anything
at
all
back
there
they
must
know
a
lot
by
now
that
why
i
want
to
look
up
but
suppose
they
want
to
kill
us
off
at
sight
objected
dorothy
they
might
be
able
to
do
it
might
they
sure
but
they
probably
would
want
to
any
more
than
you
would
step
on
an
ant
who
asked
you
to
help
him
move
a
twig
that
about
how
much
ahead
of
us
they
probably
are
of
course
we
struck
a
pure
mentality
once
who
came
darn
near
dematerializing
us
entirely
but
i
betting
that
these
folks
have
got
that
far
along
yet
by
the
way
i
got
a
hunch
about
those
pure
intellectuals
oh
tell
us
about
it
laughed
margaret
your
hunches
are
the
greatest
brainstorms
well
i
pumped
out
and
rejeweled
the
compass
we
put
on
that
funny
planet
as
a
last
resort
i
thought
we
might
maybe
visit
them
and
ask
that
bozo
we
had
the
argument
with
to
help
us
out
i
think
he
or
it
would
show
us
everything
about
the
zone
of
force
we
want
to
know
i
do
think
that
we
be
dematerialized
either
because
the
situation
would
give
him
something
more
to
think
about
for
another
thousand
cycles
and
thinking
seemed
to
be
his
main
object
in
life
however
to
get
back
to
the
subject
i
found
that
even
with
the
new
power
of
the
compass
the
entire
planet
was
still
out
of
reach
unless
dematerialized
it
that
means
about
ten
billion
as
an
absolute
minimum
think
about
that
for
a
minute
i
just
got
a
kind
of
a
hunch
that
maybe
they
do
belong
in
this
galaxy
at
all
that
they
might
be
from
some
other
galaxy
planet
and
all
just
riding
around
on
it
as
we
are
riding
in
the
is
the
idea
conceivable
to
a
sane
mind
or
not
not
decided
dorothy
promptly
we
better
go
to
bed
one
more
such
idea
in
progression
with
the
last
two
you
had
would
certainly
give
you
a
compound
fracture
of
the
skull

chapter
vii
duquesne
voyage
far
from
our
solar
system
a
slackened
its
terrific
acceleration
to
a
point
at
which
human
beings
could
walk
and
two
men
got
up
exercised
vigorously
to
restore
the
circulation
to
their
numbed
bodies
and
went
into
the
galley
to
prepare
their
meal
the
first
since
leaving
the
earth
some
eight
hours
or
more
before
because
of
the
long
and
arduous
journey
he
had
decided
upon
duquesne
had
had
to
abandon
his
custom
of
working
alone
and
had
studied
all
the
available
men
with
great
care
before
selecting
his
companion
and
relief
pilot
he
finally
had
chosen
baby
doll
loring
so
called
because
of
his
curly
yellow
hair
his
pink
and
white
complexion
his
guileless
blue
eyes
his
slight
form
of
rather
less
than
medium
height
but
never
did
outward
attributes
more
belie
the
inner
man
the
yellow
curls
covered
a
brain
agile
keen
and
hard
the
girlish
complexion
neither
paled
nor
reddened
under
stress
the
wide
blue
eyes
had
glanced
along
the
barrels
of
so
many
lethal
weapons
that
in
various
localities
the
noose
yawned
for
him
the
slender
body
was
built
of
rawhide
and
whalebone
and
responded
instantly
to
the
dictates
of
that
ruthless
brain
under
the
protection
of
steel
he
flourished
and
in
return
for
that
protection
he
performed
quietly
and
with
neatness
and
despatch
such
odd
jobs
as
were
in
his
line
with
which
he
was
commissioned
when
they
were
seated
at
an
excellent
breakfast
of
ham
and
eggs
buttered
toast
and
strong
aromatic
coffee
duquesne
broke
the
long
silence
do
you
want
to
know
where
we
are
i
say
we
were
a
long
way
from
home
by
the
way
this
elevator
of
yours
has
been
climbing
all
night
we
are
a
good
many
million
miles
from
the
earth
and
we
are
getting
farther
away
at
a
rate
that
would
have
to
be
measured
in
millions
of
miles
per
second
duquesne
watching
the
other
narrowly
as
he
made
this
startling
announcement
and
remembering
the
effect
of
a
similar
one
upon
perkins
saw
with
approval
that
the
in
midair
did
not
pause
or
waver
in
its
course
loring
noted
the
bouquet
of
his
beverage
and
took
an
appreciative
sip
before
he
replied
you
certainly
can
make
coffee
doctor
and
good
coffee
is
of
a
good
breakfast
as
to
where
we
are
that
all
right
with
me
i
can
stand
it
if
you
can
do
you
want
to
know
where
we
going
and
why
i
been
thinking
about
that
before
we
started
i
did
want
to
know
anything
because
what
a
man
does
know
he
ca
be
accused
of
spilling
in
case
of
a
leak
now
that
we
are
on
our
way
though
maybe
i
should
know
enough
about
things
to
act
intelligently
if
something
unforeseen
should
develop
if
you
rather
keep
it
dark
and
give
me
orders
when
necessary
that
all
right
with
me
too
it
your
party
you
know
i
brought
you
along
because
one
man
ca
stay
on
duty
hours
a
day
continuously
since
you
are
in
as
deep
as
you
can
get
and
since
this
trip
is
dangerous
you
should
know
everything
there
is
to
know
you
are
one
of
the
now
anyway
and
we
understand
each
other
thoroughly
i
believe
i
believe
so
back
in
the
bow
duquesne
applied
more
power
but
not
enough
to
render
movement
impossible
you
do
have
to
drive
her
as
hard
all
the
way
then
as
you
did
last
night
no
i
out
of
range
of
seaton
instrument
now
and
we
do
have
to
kill
ourselves
high
acceleration
is
punishment
for
anyone
and
we
must
keep
ourselves
fit
to
begin
with
i
suppose
that
you
are
curious
about
that
that
and
other
things
an
is
a
needle
of
copper
so
activated
that
it
points
always
toward
one
certain
object
after
being
once
set
upon
it
seaton
undoubtedly
has
one
upon
me
but
sensitive
as
they
are
they
ca
hold
on
a
mass
as
small
as
a
man
at
this
distance
that
was
why
we
left
at
midnight
after
he
had
gone
to
bed
so
that
we
be
out
of
range
before
he
woke
up
i
wanted
to
lose
him
as
he
might
interfere
if
he
knew
where
i
was
going
now
i
go
back
to
the
beginning
and
tell
you
the
whole
story
tersely
but
vividly
he
recounted
the
tale
of
the
interstellar
cruise
the
voyage
of
the
of
when
he
had
finished
loring
smoked
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
there
a
lot
of
stuff
there
that
hard
to
understand
all
at
once
do
you
mind
if
i
ask
a
few
foolish
questions
to
get
things
straightened
out
in
my
mind
go
ahead
ask
as
many
as
you
want
to
it
is
hard
to
understand
a
lot
of
that
osnomian
stuff
a
man
ca
get
it
all
at
once
osnome
is
so
far
away
how
are
you
going
to
find
it
with
one
of
the
i
mentioned
i
had
planned
on
navigating
from
notes
i
took
on
the
trip
back
to
the
earth
but
it
was
necessary
they
tried
to
keep
me
from
finding
out
anything
but
i
learned
all
about
the
compasses
built
a
few
of
them
in
their
own
shop
and
set
one
on
osnome
i
had
it
among
other
things
in
my
pocket
when
i
landed
in
fact
the
control
of
that
explosive
copper
bullet
is
the
only
thing
they
had
that
i
was
able
to
get
and
i
get
that
on
this
trip
what
is
that
arenak
armor
they
wearing
arenak
is
a
synthetic
metal
almost
perfectly
transparent
it
has
practically
the
same
refractive
index
as
air
therefore
it
is
to
all
intents
and
purposes
invisible
it
about
five
hundred
times
as
strong
as
steel
and
even
when
you
got
it
to
the
it
does
break
but
stretches
out
and
snaps
back
like
rubber
with
the
strength
unimpaired
it
the
most
wonderful
thing
i
saw
on
the
whole
trip
they
make
complete
suits
of
it
of
course
they
are
very
comfortable
but
since
they
are
only
a
tenth
of
an
inch
they
can
be
worn
and
a
tenth
of
an
inch
of
that
stuff
will
stop
a
bullet
stop
it
a
tenth
of
an
inch
of
arenak
is
harder
to
pierce
than
fifty
inches
of
our
hardest
toughest
armor
steel
a
projectile
could
get
through
it
it
hard
to
believe
but
nevertheless
it
a
fact
the
only
way
to
kill
seaton
with
a
gun
would
be
to
use
one
heavy
enough
so
that
the
shock
of
the
impact
would
kill
him
and
it
would
surprise
me
a
bit
if
he
had
his
armor
anchored
with
an
attractor
against
that
very
contingency
even
if
he
has
you
can
imagine
the
chance
of
getting
action
against
him
with
a
gun
of
that
size
yes
i
heard
that
he
is
fast
that
does
tell
half
of
it
you
know
that
i
handy
with
a
gun
myself
you
faster
than
i
am
and
that
saying
something
you
chain
lightning
well
seaton
is
at
least
that
much
faster
than
i
am
you
never
seen
him
work
i
have
on
that
osnomian
dock
he
shot
twice
before
i
started
and
shot
twice
to
my
once
from
then
on
i
must
have
been
shooting
a
quarter
of
a
second
after
he
had
his
side
all
cleaned
up
to
make
it
worse
i
missed
once
with
my
left
hand
he
did
there
absolutely
no
use
tackling
richard
seaton
without
an
osnomian
or
something
better
but
as
you
know
brookings
always
has
been
and
always
will
be
a
fool
he
wo
believe
anything
new
until
after
he
has
actually
been
shown
well
i
imagine
he
will
be
shown
plenty
by
this
evening
well
i
never
tackle
him
with
heat
how
does
he
get
that
way
he
naturally
fast
and
has
practiced
work
ever
since
he
was
a
kid
he
one
of
the
best
amateur
magicians
in
the
country
and
i
will
say
that
his
ability
along
that
line
has
come
in
handy
for
him
more
than
once
i
see
where
you
right
in
wanting
to
get
something
since
we
have
only
ordinary
weapons
and
they
have
all
that
stuff
this
trip
is
to
get
a
little
something
for
ourselves
i
take
it
exactly
and
you
know
enough
now
to
understand
what
we
are
out
here
to
get
for
ourselves
you
have
guessed
that
we
are
headed
for
osnome
i
suspected
it
however
if
you
were
going
only
to
osnome
you
would
have
gone
alone
so
i
also
suspect
that
that
only
half
of
it
i
have
no
idea
what
it
is
but
you
got
something
else
on
your
mind
you
right
i
knew
you
were
keen
when
i
was
on
osnome
i
found
out
something
that
only
four
other
men
all
dead
ever
knew
there
is
a
race
of
men
far
ahead
of
the
osnomians
in
science
particularly
in
warfare
they
live
a
long
way
beyond
osnome
it
is
my
plan
to
steal
an
osnomian
airship
and
mount
all
its
ray
screens
generators
guns
and
everything
else
upon
this
ship
or
else
convert
their
vessel
into
a
instead
of
using
their
ordinary
power
however
we
will
do
as
seaton
did
and
use
power
which
is
practically
infinite
then
we
have
everything
seaton
got
but
that
enough
i
want
enough
more
than
he
got
to
wipe
him
out
therefore
after
we
get
a
ship
armed
to
suit
us
we
visit
this
strange
planet
and
either
come
to
terms
with
them
or
else
steal
a
ship
from
them
then
we
have
their
stuff
and
that
of
the
osnomians
as
well
as
our
own
seaton
wo
last
long
after
that
do
you
mind
if
i
ask
how
you
got
that
dope
not
at
all
except
when
right
with
seaton
i
could
do
pretty
much
as
i
pleased
and
i
used
to
take
long
walks
for
exercise
the
osnomians
tired
very
easily
being
so
weak
and
because
of
the
light
gravity
of
the
planet
i
had
to
do
a
lot
of
work
or
walking
to
keep
in
any
kind
of
condition
at
all
i
learned
kondalian
quickly
and
got
so
friendly
with
the
guards
that
pretty
soon
they
quit
trying
to
keep
me
in
sight
but
waited
at
the
edge
of
the
palace
grounds
until
i
came
back
and
joined
them
well
on
one
trip
i
was
fifteen
miles
or
so
from
the
city
when
an
airship
crashed
down
in
a
woods
about
half
a
mile
from
me
it
was
in
an
uninhabited
district
and
nobody
else
saw
it
i
went
over
to
investigate
thinking
probably
i
could
find
out
something
useful
it
had
the
whole
front
end
cut
or
broken
off
and
that
made
me
curious
because
no
imaginable
fall
will
break
an
arenak
hull
i
walked
in
through
the
hole
and
saw
that
it
was
one
of
their
fighting
tenders
a
combination
warship
and
repair
shop
with
all
of
the
stuff
in
it
that
i
been
telling
you
about
the
generators
were
mostly
burned
out
and
the
propelling
and
lifting
motors
were
out
of
commission
i
prowled
around
getting
acquainted
with
it
and
found
a
lot
of
useful
instruments
and
best
of
all
one
of
dunark
new
mechanical
educators
with
complete
instructions
for
its
use
also
i
found
three
bodies
and
thought
try
it
out
just
a
minute
only
three
bodies
on
a
warship
and
what
good
could
a
mechanical
educator
do
you
if
the
men
were
all
dead
three
is
all
i
found
then
but
there
was
another
one
three
men
and
a
captain
compose
an
osnomian
crew
for
any
ordinary
vessel
everything
is
automatic
you
know
as
for
the
men
being
dead
that
does
make
any
difference
you
can
read
their
brains
just
the
same
if
they
been
dead
too
long
however
when
i
tried
to
read
theirs
i
found
only
blanks
their
brains
had
been
destroyed
so
that
nobody
could
read
them
that
did
look
funny
so
i
ransacked
the
ship
from
truck
to
keelson
and
finally
found
another
body
wearing
an
in
a
sort
of
closet
off
the
control
room
i
put
the
educator
on
it
this
is
getting
good
it
sounds
like
a
page
of
the
old
that
i
used
to
read
when
i
was
a
boy
you
know
it
really
surprising
that
brookings
did
believe
a
lot
of
this
stuff
as
i
have
said
a
lot
of
it
is
hard
to
understand
but
i
going
to
show
it
to
you
all
that
and
more
oh
i
believe
it
all
right
after
riding
in
this
boat
and
looking
out
of
the
windows
i
believe
anything
reading
a
dead
man
brain
is
steep
though
i
let
you
do
it
after
we
get
there
i
do
understand
exactly
how
it
works
myself
but
i
know
how
to
operate
one
well
i
found
out
that
this
man
brain
was
in
good
shape
and
i
got
a
shock
when
i
read
it
here
what
he
had
been
through
they
had
been
flying
very
high
on
their
way
to
the
front
when
their
ship
was
seized
by
an
invisible
force
and
thrown
upward
he
must
have
thought
faster
than
the
others
because
he
put
on
an
and
dived
into
this
locker
where
he
hid
under
a
pile
of
gear
fixing
things
so
that
he
could
see
out
through
the
transparent
arenak
of
the
wall
no
sooner
was
he
hidden
that
the
front
end
of
the
ship
went
up
in
a
blaze
of
light
in
spite
of
their
ray
screens
going
full
blast
they
were
up
so
high
by
that
time
that
when
the
bow
was
burned
off
the
other
three
fainted
from
lack
of
air
then
their
generators
went
out
and
pretty
soon
two
strangers
entered
they
were
wearing
vacuum
suits
and
were
very
short
and
stocky
giving
the
impression
of
enormous
strength
they
brought
an
educator
of
their
own
with
them
and
read
the
brains
of
the
three
men
then
they
dropped
the
ship
a
few
thousand
feet
and
revived
the
three
with
a
drink
of
something
out
of
a
flask
must
have
been
different
from
the
kind
handled
by
most
booties
i
know
then
the
stuff
we
been
getting
lately
would
make
a
man
more
unconscious
than
ever
some
powerful
drug
probably
but
the
osnomian
did
know
anything
about
it
after
the
men
were
revived
the
strangers
apparently
from
sheer
cruelty
and
love
of
torturing
their
victims
informed
them
in
the
osnomian
language
that
they
were
from
another
world
on
the
far
edge
of
the
galaxy
they
even
told
them
knowing
that
the
osnomians
knew
nothing
of
astronomy
exactly
where
they
were
from
then
they
went
on
to
say
that
they
wanted
the
entire
green
system
for
themselves
and
that
in
something
like
two
years
of
our
time
they
were
going
to
wipe
out
all
the
present
inhabitants
of
the
system
and
take
it
over
as
a
base
for
further
operations
after
that
they
amused
themselves
by
describing
exactly
the
kinds
of
death
and
destruction
they
were
going
to
use
they
described
most
of
it
in
great
detail
it
too
involved
to
tell
you
about
now
but
they
got
rays
generators
and
screens
that
even
the
osnomians
never
heard
of
and
of
course
they
got
energy
the
same
as
we
have
after
telling
them
all
this
and
watching
them
suffer
they
put
a
machine
on
their
heads
and
they
dropped
dead
probably
what
disintegrated
their
brains
then
they
looked
the
ship
over
rather
casually
as
though
they
did
see
anything
they
were
interested
in
crippled
the
motors
and
went
away
the
vessel
was
then
released
and
crashed
this
man
of
course
was
killed
by
the
fall
i
buried
the
men
i
did
want
anybody
else
reading
that
brain
hid
some
of
the
stuff
i
wanted
most
and
camouflaged
the
ship
so
that
i
fairly
sure
that
it
there
yet
i
decided
then
to
make
this
trip
i
see
loring
mind
was
grappling
with
these
new
and
strange
facts
that
news
is
staggering
doctor
think
of
it
everybody
thinks
our
own
world
is
everything
there
is
our
world
is
simply
a
grain
of
dust
in
the
universe
most
people
know
it
academically
but
very
few
ever
give
the
fact
any
actual
consideration
but
now
that
you
had
a
little
time
to
get
used
to
the
idea
of
there
being
other
worlds
and
some
of
them
as
far
ahead
of
us
in
science
as
we
are
ahead
of
the
monkeys
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
agree
with
you
that
we
got
their
stuff
said
loring
however
it
occurs
to
me
as
a
possibility
that
they
may
have
so
much
stuff
that
we
wo
be
able
to
make
the
approach
however
if
the
osnomian
fittings
we
going
to
get
are
as
good
as
you
say
they
are
i
think
that
two
such
men
as
you
and
i
can
get
at
least
a
lunch
while
any
other
crew
no
matter
who
they
are
are
getting
a
square
meal
i
like
your
style
loring
you
and
i
will
have
the
world
eating
out
of
our
hands
shortly
after
we
get
back
as
far
as
actual
procedure
over
there
is
concerned
of
course
i
have
made
any
definite
plans
have
to
size
up
the
situation
after
we
get
there
before
we
can
know
exactly
what
we
have
to
do
however
we
are
not
coming
back
you
said
something
chief
and
the
two
men
so
startlingly
unlike
physically
but
so
alike
inwardly
shook
hands
in
token
of
their
mutual
dedication
to
a
single
purpose
loring
was
then
instructed
in
the
simple
navigation
of
the
ship
of
space
and
thereafter
the
two
men
took
their
regular
shifts
at
the
controls
in
due
time
they
approached
osnome
and
duquesne
studied
the
planet
carefully
through
a
telescope
before
he
ventured
down
into
the
atmosphere
this
half
of
it
used
to
be
mardonale
i
suppose
it
all
kondal
now
no
there
a
war
on
down
there
yet
at
least
there
a
disturbance
of
some
kind
and
on
this
planet
that
means
war
what
are
you
looking
for
exactly
asked
loring
who
was
also
examining
the
terrain
with
a
telescope
they
got
some
spherical
like
seaton
i
know
they
had
one
and
they
probably
built
more
of
them
since
that
time
their
airships
ca
touch
us
but
those
cruisers
would
be
pure
poison
for
us
the
way
we
are
fixed
now
can
you
see
any
of
them
not
yet
too
far
away
to
make
out
details
they
certainly
having
a
hot
time
down
there
though
in
that
one
spot
they
dropped
lower
toward
the
stronghold
which
was
being
so
stubbornly
defended
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
third
planet
of
the
fourteenth
sun
and
so
savagely
attacked
by
the
kondalian
forces
there
we
can
see
what
they
doing
now
and
duquesne
anchored
the
vessel
with
an
attractor
i
want
to
see
if
they
got
many
of
those
in
action
and
you
will
want
to
see
what
war
is
like
when
it
is
fought
by
people
who
have
been
making
war
steadily
for
ten
thousand
years
poised
at
the
limit
of
clear
visibility
the
two
men
studied
the
incessant
battle
being
waged
beneath
them
they
saw
not
one
but
fully
a
thousand
of
the
globular
craft
high
in
the
air
and
grouped
in
a
great
circle
around
an
immense
fortification
upon
the
ground
below
they
saw
no
airships
in
the
line
of
battle
but
noticed
that
many
such
vessels
were
flying
to
and
from
the
front
apparently
carrying
supplies
the
fortress
was
an
immense
dome
of
some
glassy
transparent
material
partially
covered
with
slag
through
which
they
saw
that
the
central
space
was
occupied
by
orderly
groups
of
barracks
and
that
round
the
circumference
were
arranged
gigantic
generators
projectors
and
other
machinery
at
whose
purposes
they
could
not
even
guess
from
the
base
of
the
dome
a
apron
of
the
same
glassy
substance
spread
over
the
ground
and
above
this
apron
and
around
the
dome
were
thrown
the
mighty
defensive
visible
now
and
then
in
scintillating
violet
splendor
as
one
of
the
kondalian
projectors
sought
in
vain
for
an
opening
but
the
saw
with
surprise
that
the
main
attack
was
not
being
directed
at
the
dome
that
only
an
occasional
ray
was
thrown
against
it
in
order
to
make
the
defenders
keep
their
screens
up
continuously
the
edge
of
the
apron
was
bearing
the
brunt
of
that
vicious
and
attack
and
most
concerned
the
desperate
defense
for
miles
beyond
that
edge
and
as
deep
under
it
as
frightful
rays
and
enormous
charges
of
explosive
copper
could
penetrate
the
ground
was
one
seething
flaming
volcano
of
molten
and
incandescent
lava
lava
constantly
being
volatilized
by
the
unimaginable
heat
of
those
rays
and
being
hurled
for
miles
in
all
directions
by
the
inconceivable
power
of
those
explosive
copper
projectiles
the
heaviest
projectiles
that
could
be
used
without
endangering
the
planet
itself
being
directed
under
the
exposed
edge
of
that
unbreakable
apron
which
was
in
actuality
anchored
to
the
solid
core
of
the
planet
itself
lava
flowing
into
and
filling
up
the
vast
craters
caused
by
the
explosions
the
attack
seemed
fiercest
at
certain
points
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
apart
around
the
circle
and
after
a
time
the
watchers
perceived
that
at
those
points
under
the
edge
of
the
apron
in
that
indescribable
inferno
of
boiling
lava
destructive
rays
and
disintegrating
copper
there
were
enemy
machines
at
work
these
machines
were
strengthening
the
protecting
apron
and
extending
it
very
slowly
but
ever
wider
and
ever
deeper
as
the
ground
under
it
and
before
it
was
volatilized
or
hurled
away
by
the
awful
forces
of
the
kondalian
attack
so
much
destruction
had
already
been
wrought
that
the
edge
of
the
apron
and
its
molten
moat
were
already
fully
a
mile
below
the
normal
level
of
that
cratered
torn
and
tortured
plain
now
and
then
one
of
the
mechanical
moles
would
cease
its
labors
overcome
by
the
concentrated
fury
of
destruction
centered
upon
it
its
shattered
remnants
would
be
withdrawn
and
shortly
repaired
or
replaced
it
would
be
back
at
work
but
it
was
not
the
defenders
who
had
suffered
most
heavily
the
fortress
was
literally
ringed
about
with
the
shattered
remnants
of
airships
and
the
riddled
hulls
of
more
than
a
few
of
those
mighty
globular
cruisers
of
the
void
bore
mute
testimony
to
the
deadliness
and
efficiency
of
the
warfare
of
the
invaders
even
as
they
watched
one
of
the
spheres
unable
for
some
reason
to
maintain
its
screens
or
overcome
by
the
awful
forces
playing
upon
it
flared
from
white
into
and
through
the
violet
and
was
hurled
upward
as
though
shot
from
the
mouth
of
some
brobdingnagian
howitzer
a
door
opened
and
from
its
flaming
interior
four
figures
leaped
out
into
the
air
followed
by
a
puff
of
smoke
at
the
first
sign
of
trouble
the
ship
next
it
in
line
leaped
in
front
of
it
and
the
four
figures
floated
gently
to
the
ground
supported
by
friendly
attractors
and
protected
from
enemy
rays
by
the
bulk
and
by
the
screens
of
the
rescuing
vessel
two
great
airships
soared
upward
from
back
of
the
lines
and
hauled
the
disabled
vessel
to
the
ground
by
means
of
their
powerful
attractors
the
two
observers
saw
with
amazement
that
after
brief
attention
from
an
the
original
four
men
climbed
back
into
their
warship
and
she
again
shot
into
the
fray
apparently
as
good
as
ever
what
do
you
know
about
that
exclaimed
duquesne
that
gives
me
an
idea
loring
they
must
get
to
them
that
way
fairly
often
to
judge
by
the
teamwork
they
use
when
it
does
happen
how
about
waiting
until
they
disable
another
one
like
that
and
then
grabbing
it
while
its
in
the
air
deserted
and
unable
to
fight
back
one
of
those
ships
is
worth
a
thousand
of
this
one
even
if
we
had
everything
known
to
the
osnomians
that
a
real
idea
those
boats
certainly
are
brutes
for
punishment
agreed
loring
and
as
both
men
again
settled
down
to
watch
the
battle
he
went
on
so
this
is
war
out
this
way
you
right
seaton
with
half
this
stuff
could
whip
the
combined
armies
and
navies
of
the
world
i
do
blame
brookings
much
though
at
that
nobody
could
believe
half
of
this
unless
they
could
actually
see
it
as
we
are
doing
i
ca
understand
it
duquesne
frowned
as
he
considered
the
situation
the
attackers
are
kondalians
all
right
those
ships
are
developments
of
the
but
i
do
get
that
fort
at
all
wonder
if
it
can
be
the
strangers
already
do
think
so
they
are
due
for
a
couple
of
years
yet
and
i
do
think
the
kondalians
could
stand
against
them
a
minute
it
must
be
what
is
left
of
mardonale
although
i
never
heard
of
anything
like
that
probably
it
is
some
new
invention
they
dug
up
at
the
last
minute
that
it
i
guess
and
his
brow
cleared
it
could
be
anything
else
they
waited
long
for
the
incident
to
be
repeated
and
finally
their
patience
was
rewarded
when
the
next
vessel
was
disabled
and
hurled
upward
by
the
concentration
of
enemy
forces
duquesne
darted
down
seized
it
with
his
most
powerful
attractor
and
whisked
it
away
into
space
at
such
a
velocity
that
to
the
eyes
of
the
kordalians
it
simply
disappeared
he
took
the
disabled
warship
far
out
into
space
and
allowed
it
to
cool
off
for
a
long
time
before
deciding
that
it
was
safe
to
board
it
through
the
transparent
walls
they
could
see
no
sign
of
life
and
duquesne
donned
a
vacuum
suit
and
stepped
into
the
airlock
as
loring
held
the
steel
vessel
close
to
the
stranger
duquesne
leaped
lightly
through
the
open
door
into
the
interior
shutting
the
door
he
opened
an
auxiliary
adjusting
the
gauge
to
one
atmosphere
as
he
did
so
the
pressure
normal
he
divested
himself
of
the
suit
and
made
a
thorough
examination
of
the
vessel
he
then
signaled
loring
to
follow
him
and
soon
both
ships
were
over
kondal
so
high
as
to
be
invisible
from
the
ground
plunging
the
vessel
like
a
bullet
towards
the
grove
in
which
he
had
left
the
kondalian
airship
he
slowed
abruptly
just
in
time
to
make
a
safe
landing
as
he
stepped
out
upon
osnomian
soil
loring
landed
the
earthly
ship
hardly
less
skillfully
this
saves
us
a
lot
of
trouble
loring
this
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
finest
of
the
universe
and
just
about
ready
for
anything
how
did
they
get
to
it
one
of
the
screen
generators
apparently
weakened
a
trifle
probably
from
weeks
of
continuous
use
that
let
some
of
the
rays
come
through
everything
got
hot
and
the
crew
had
to
jump
or
roast
nothing
is
hurt
though
as
the
ship
was
thrown
up
and
out
of
range
before
the
arenak
melted
at
all
the
copper
repellers
are
gone
of
course
and
most
of
the
bars
that
were
in
use
are
melted
down
but
there
was
enough
of
the
main
bar
left
to
drive
the
ship
and
we
can
replace
the
melted
stuff
easily
enough
nothing
else
was
hurt
as
there
absolutely
nothing
in
the
structure
of
these
vessels
that
can
be
burned
even
the
insulation
in
the
coils
and
generators
has
a
higher
than
that
of
porcelain
and
not
all
the
copper
was
melted
either
some
of
these
storerooms
are
lined
with
two
feet
of
insulation
and
are
piled
full
of
bars
and
explosive
ammunition
what
was
the
smoke
we
saw
then
that
was
their
it
cooked
to
an
ash
and
their
water
was
all
boiled
away
through
the
those
rays
certainly
can
put
out
a
lot
of
heat
in
a
second
or
two
can
the
two
of
us
put
on
those
copper
this
ship
must
be
feet
in
diameter
yes
it
a
lot
bigger
than
the
was
it
one
of
their
latest
models
or
it
would
have
been
on
the
front
line
as
to
banding
on
the
repellers
that
easy
that
airship
is
half
full
of
machinery
that
can
do
everything
but
talk
i
know
how
to
use
most
of
it
from
seeing
it
in
use
and
we
can
figure
out
the
rest
in
that
unfrequented
spot
there
was
little
danger
of
detection
from
the
air
and
none
whatsoever
of
detection
from
the
ground
of
upon
osnome
there
is
none
nevertheless
the
two
men
camouflaged
the
vessels
so
that
they
were
visible
only
to
keen
and
direct
scrutiny
and
drove
their
task
through
to
completion
on
the
shortest
possible
time
the
copper
repellers
were
banded
on
and
much
additional
machinery
was
installed
in
the
already
shop
this
done
they
transferred
to
their
warship
food
water
bedding
instruments
and
everything
else
they
needed
or
wanted
from
their
own
ship
and
from
the
disabled
kondalian
airship
they
made
a
last
tour
of
inspection
to
be
sure
they
had
overlooked
nothing
useful
then
embarked
think
anybody
will
find
those
ships
they
could
get
a
good
line
on
what
we
done
probably
eventually
loring
so
we
better
destroy
them
we
better
take
a
short
hop
first
though
to
test
everything
out
since
you
not
familiar
with
the
controls
of
a
ship
of
this
type
you
need
practise
shoot
us
up
around
that
moon
over
there
and
bring
us
back
to
this
spot
she
a
boat
easy
like
a
bicycle
declared
loring
as
he
brought
the
vessel
lightly
to
a
landing
upon
their
return
we
can
burn
the
old
one
up
now
we
never
need
her
again
any
more
than
a
snake
needs
his
last
year
skin
she
good
all
right
those
two
hulks
must
be
put
out
of
existence
but
we
should
do
it
here
the
rays
would
set
the
woods
afire
and
the
metal
would
condense
all
around
we
do
want
to
leave
any
tracks
so
we
better
pull
them
out
into
space
to
destroy
them
we
could
turn
them
loose
and
as
you
never
worked
a
ray
it
be
good
practice
for
you
also
i
want
you
to
see
for
yourself
just
what
our
best
amounts
to
compared
with
arenak
when
they
towed
the
two
vessels
far
out
into
space
loring
put
into
practise
the
instruction
he
had
received
from
duquesne
concerning
the
complex
armament
of
their
vessel
he
swung
the
upon
the
kondalian
airship
pressed
the
connectors
of
the
softener
ray
the
heat
ray
and
the
induction
ray
and
threw
the
master
switch
almost
instantly
the
entire
hull
became
blinding
white
but
it
was
several
seconds
before
the
extremely
refractory
material
began
to
volatilize
though
the
metal
was
less
than
an
inch
think
it
retained
its
shape
and
strength
stubbornly
and
only
slowly
did
it
disappear
in
flaming
flaring
gusts
of
incandescent
gas
there
you
seen
what
an
inch
of
arenak
is
like
said
duquesne
when
the
destruction
was
complete
now
shine
it
on
that
armor
hull
of
our
old
bus
and
see
what
happens
loring
did
so
as
the
beam
touched
it
the
steel
disappeared
in
one
flare
of
radiance
as
he
swung
the
projector
in
one
flashing
arc
from
the
stem
to
the
stern
there
was
nothing
left
loring
swinging
the
beam
whistled
in
amazement
wow
what
a
difference
and
this
ship
of
ours
has
a
skin
of
arenak
six
feet
thick
yes
now
you
understand
why
i
did
want
to
argue
with
anybody
out
here
as
long
as
we
were
in
our
steel
ship
i
understand
all
right
but
i
ca
understand
the
power
of
these
rays
suppose
i
had
had
all
twenty
of
them
on
instead
of
only
three
in
that
case
i
think
that
we
could
have
whipped
even
the
short
thick
strangers
you
and
me
both
but
say
every
ship
got
to
have
a
name
this
new
one
of
ours
is
such
a
sweet
harmless
inoffensive
little
thing
we
better
name
her
the
had
we
duquesne
started
the
off
in
the
direction
of
the
solar
system
occupied
by
the
warlike
strangers
but
he
did
not
hurry
he
and
loring
practiced
incessantly
for
days
at
the
controls
darting
here
and
there
putting
on
terrific
acceleration
until
the
indicators
showed
a
velocity
of
hundreds
of
thousand
of
miles
per
second
then
reversing
the
acceleration
until
the
velocity
was
zero
they
studied
the
controls
and
alarm
system
until
each
knew
perfectly
every
instrument
every
tiny
light
and
the
tone
of
each
bell
they
practiced
with
the
rays
singly
and
in
combination
with
the
visiplates
and
with
the
many
levers
and
dials
until
each
was
so
familiar
with
the
complex
installation
that
his
handling
of
every
control
had
become
automatic
not
until
then
did
duquesne
give
the
word
to
start
out
in
earnest
toward
their
goal
at
an
unthinkable
distance
they
had
not
been
under
way
long
when
an
alarm
bell
sounded
its
warning
and
a
brilliant
green
light
began
flashing
upon
the
board
hm
m
duquesne
frowned
as
he
reversed
the
bar
outside
energy
detector
somebody
using
power
out
here
direction
about
dead
ahead
straight
down
let
see
if
we
can
see
anything
he
swung
number
six
the
telescopic
visiplate
into
connection
after
what
seemed
to
them
a
long
time
they
saw
a
sudden
sharp
flash
apparently
an
immense
distance
ahead
and
simultaneously
three
more
alarm
bells
rang
and
three
colored
lights
flashed
briefly
somebody
got
quite
a
jolt
then
three
rays
in
action
at
once
for
three
or
four
seconds
reported
duquesne
as
he
applied
still
more
negative
acceleration
i
like
to
know
what
this
is
all
about
he
exclaimed
after
a
time
as
they
saw
a
subdued
glow
which
lasted
a
minute
or
two
as
the
warning
light
was
flashing
more
and
more
slowly
and
with
diminishing
intensity
the
was
once
more
put
upon
her
course
as
she
proceeded
however
the
warnings
of
the
liberation
of
energy
grew
stronger
and
stronger
and
both
men
scanned
their
path
intensely
for
a
sight
of
the
source
of
the
disturbance
while
their
velocity
was
cut
to
only
a
few
hundred
miles
an
hour
suddenly
the
indicator
swerved
and
pointed
behind
them
showing
that
they
had
passed
the
object
whatever
it
was
duquesne
instantly
applied
power
and
snapped
on
a
small
searchlight
if
it
so
small
that
we
could
see
it
when
we
passed
it
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
we
be
able
to
find
it
with
a
light
after
some
search
they
saw
an
object
floating
in
a
vacuum
suit
shall
one
of
us
get
in
the
airlock
or
shall
we
bring
it
in
with
an
attractor
asked
loring
an
attractor
by
all
means
two
or
three
of
them
in
fact
to
whatever
it
is
never
take
any
chances
it
probably
an
osnomian
but
you
never
can
tell
it
may
be
one
of
those
other
people
we
know
they
were
around
here
a
few
weeks
ago
and
they
the
only
ones
i
know
of
that
have
power
besides
us
and
the
osnomians
that
no
osnomian
he
continued
as
the
stranger
was
drawn
into
the
airlock
he
big
enough
around
for
four
osnomians
and
very
short
we
take
no
chances
at
all
with
that
fellow
the
captive
was
brought
into
the
control
room
pinioned
head
hand
and
foot
with
attractors
and
repellers
before
duquesne
approached
him
he
then
read
the
temperature
and
pressure
of
the
stranger
and
allowed
the
surplus
air
to
escape
slowly
before
removing
the
suit
and
revealing
one
of
the
fenachrone
eyes
closed
unconscious
or
dead
duquesne
leaped
for
the
educator
and
handed
loring
a
headset
put
this
on
quick
he
may
be
only
unconscious
and
we
might
not
be
able
to
get
a
thing
from
him
if
he
were
awake
loring
donned
the
headset
still
staring
at
the
monstrous
form
with
amazement
not
unmixed
with
awe
while
duquesne
paying
no
attention
to
anything
except
the
knowledge
he
was
seeking
manipulated
the
controls
of
the
instrument
his
first
quest
was
for
the
weapons
and
armament
of
the
vessel
in
this
he
was
disappointed
as
he
learned
that
the
stranger
was
one
of
the
navigating
engineers
and
as
such
had
no
detailed
knowledge
of
the
matters
of
prime
importance
to
the
inquisitor
he
did
have
a
complete
knowledge
of
the
marvelous
fenachrone
propulsion
system
however
and
this
duquesne
carefully
transferred
to
his
own
brain
he
then
rapidly
explored
other
regions
of
that
fearsome
organ
of
thought
as
the
gigantic
and
inhuman
brain
was
spread
before
them
duquesne
and
loring
read
not
only
the
language
customs
and
culture
of
the
fenachrone
but
all
their
plans
for
the
future
as
well
as
the
events
of
the
past
plainly
in
his
mind
they
perceived
how
he
had
been
cast
adrift
in
the
emptiness
of
the
void
they
saw
the
fenachrone
cruiser
lying
in
wait
for
the
two
globular
vessels
looking
through
an
extraordinarily
powerful
telescope
with
the
eyes
of
their
prisoner
they
saw
them
approach
all
unsuspecting
duquesne
recognized
all
five
persons
in
the
and
dunark
and
sitar
in
the
kondal
such
was
that
unearthly
optical
instrument
and
so
clear
was
the
impression
upon
the
mind
before
him
they
saw
the
attack
and
the
battle
they
saw
the
throw
off
her
zone
of
force
and
attack
saw
this
one
survivor
standing
directly
in
line
with
a
huge
and
saw
the
spring
severed
by
the
zone
the
free
end
under
its
thousands
of
pounds
of
tension
had
struck
the
being
upon
the
side
of
the
head
and
the
force
of
the
blow
only
partially
blocked
by
the
heavy
helmet
had
hurled
him
out
through
the
yawning
gap
in
the
wall
and
hundreds
of
miles
out
into
space
suddenly
the
clear
view
of
the
brain
of
the
fenachrone
became
blurred
and
meaningless
and
the
flow
of
knowledge
ceased
the
prisoner
had
regained
consciousness
and
was
trying
with
all
his
gigantic
strength
to
break
from
those
intangible
bonds
that
held
him
so
powerful
were
the
forces
upon
him
however
that
only
a
few
twitching
muscles
gave
evidence
that
he
was
struggling
at
all
glancing
about
him
he
recognized
the
attractors
and
repellers
bearing
upon
him
ceased
his
efforts
to
escape
and
hurled
the
full
power
of
his
baleful
gaze
into
the
black
eyes
so
close
to
his
own
but
duquesne
mind
always
under
perfect
control
and
now
amply
reenforced
by
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
stranger
own
knowledge
and
power
did
not
waver
under
the
force
of
even
that
hypnotic
glare
it
is
useless
as
you
observe
he
said
coldly
in
the
stranger
own
tongue
and
sneered
you
are
perfectly
helpless
unlike
you
of
the
fenachrone
however
men
of
my
race
do
not
always
kill
strangers
at
sight
merely
because
they
are
strangers
i
will
spare
your
life
if
you
can
give
me
anything
of
enough
value
to
me
to
make
extra
time
and
trouble
worth
while
you
read
my
mind
while
i
could
not
resist
your
childish
efforts
i
will
have
no
traffic
whatever
with
you
who
have
destroyed
my
vessel
if
you
have
mentality
enough
to
understand
any
portion
of
my
mind
which
i
doubt
you
already
know
the
fate
in
store
for
you
do
with
me
what
you
will
this
from
the
stranger
duquesne
pondered
long
before
he
replied
considering
whether
it
was
to
his
advantage
to
inform
this
stranger
of
the
facts
finally
he
decided
sir
neither
i
nor
this
vessel
had
anything
to
do
with
the
destruction
of
your
warship
our
detectors
discovered
you
floating
in
empty
space
we
stopped
and
rescued
you
from
death
we
have
seen
nothing
else
save
what
we
saw
pictured
in
your
own
brain
i
know
that
in
common
with
all
of
your
race
you
possess
neither
conscience
nor
honor
as
we
understand
the
terms
an
automatic
liar
by
instinct
and
training
whenever
you
think
lies
will
best
serve
your
purpose
you
may
yet
have
intelligence
enough
to
recognize
simple
truth
when
you
hear
it
you
already
have
observed
that
we
are
of
the
same
race
as
those
who
destroyed
your
vessel
and
have
assumed
that
we
are
with
them
in
that
you
are
wrong
it
is
true
that
i
am
acquainted
with
those
others
but
they
are
my
enemies
i
am
here
to
kill
them
not
to
aid
them
you
have
already
helped
me
in
one
way
i
know
as
much
as
does
my
enemy
concerning
the
impenetrable
shield
of
force
if
i
will
return
you
unharmed
to
your
own
planet
will
you
assist
me
in
stealing
one
of
your
ships
of
space
so
that
i
may
destroy
that
the
fenachrone
paying
no
attention
to
duquesne
barbed
comments
concerning
his
honor
and
veracity
did
not
hesitate
an
instant
in
his
reply
i
will
not
we
supermen
of
the
fenachrone
will
allow
no
vessel
of
ours
with
its
secrets
unknown
to
any
others
of
the
universe
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
any
of
the
lesser
breeds
of
men
well
you
did
try
to
lie
that
time
anyway
said
duquesne
but
think
a
minute
seaton
my
enemy
already
has
one
of
your
vessels
think
he
is
too
much
of
a
fool
to
put
it
back
together
and
to
learn
its
every
secret
then
too
remember
that
i
have
your
mind
and
can
get
along
without
you
even
though
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
you
could
be
of
enough
help
to
me
so
that
i
would
save
your
life
in
exchange
for
that
help
also
remember
that
superman
though
you
may
be
your
mentality
can
not
cope
with
the
forces
i
have
bearing
upon
you
neither
will
your
being
a
superman
enable
your
body
to
retain
life
after
i
have
pushed
you
through
yonder
door
dressed
as
you
are
in
a
silken
tunic
i
have
the
normal
love
of
life
was
the
reply
but
some
things
can
not
be
done
even
with
life
at
stake
stealing
a
vessel
of
the
fenachrone
is
one
of
those
things
i
can
however
do
this
much
if
you
will
return
me
to
my
own
planet
you
two
shall
be
received
as
guests
aboard
one
of
our
vessels
and
shall
be
allowed
to
witness
the
vengeance
of
the
fenachrone
upon
your
enemy
then
you
shall
be
returned
to
your
vessel
and
allowed
to
depart
unharmed
now
you
are
lying
by
rote
i
know
just
what
you
do
said
duquesne
get
that
idea
out
of
your
head
right
now
the
attractors
now
holding
you
will
not
be
released
until
after
you
have
told
all
then
and
then
only
will
we
try
to
discover
a
way
of
returning
you
to
your
own
world
safely
and
yet
in
a
manner
which
will
in
no
way
jeopardize
my
own
safety
incidentally
i
warn
you
that
the
first
sign
of
an
attempt
to
play
false
with
me
in
any
way
will
mean
your
instant
death
the
prisoner
remained
silent
analyzing
every
feature
of
the
situation
and
duquesne
continued
coldly
here
something
else
for
you
to
think
about
if
you
are
unwilling
to
help
us
what
is
to
prevent
me
from
killing
you
and
then
hunting
up
seaton
and
making
peace
with
him
for
the
duration
of
this
forthcoming
war
with
the
fragments
of
your
vessel
which
he
has
with
my
knowledge
of
your
mind
reenforced
by
your
own
dead
brain
and
with
the
vast
resources
of
all
the
planets
of
the
green
system
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
plans
of
the
fenachrone
will
be
seriously
interfered
with
myriads
of
your
race
will
certainly
lose
their
lives
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
your
entire
race
would
be
destroyed
understand
that
i
care
nothing
for
the
green
system
you
are
welcome
to
it
if
you
do
as
i
ask
if
you
do
not
i
shall
warn
them
and
help
them
simply
to
protect
my
world
which
is
now
my
own
personal
property
in
return
for
our
armament
and
equipment
you
promise
not
to
warn
the
green
system
against
us
the
death
of
your
enemy
takes
first
place
in
your
mind
the
stranger
spoke
thoughtfully
in
that
i
understand
your
viewpoint
thoroughly
but
after
i
have
remodeled
your
into
ours
and
have
piloted
you
to
our
planet
what
assurance
have
i
that
you
will
liberate
me
as
you
have
said
none
whatever
i
have
made
and
am
asking
no
promises
since
i
can
not
expect
you
to
trust
me
any
more
than
i
can
trust
you
enough
of
this
argument
i
am
master
here
and
i
am
dictating
terms
we
can
get
along
without
you
therefore
you
must
decide
quickly
whether
you
would
rather
die
suddenly
and
surely
here
in
space
and
right
now
or
help
us
as
i
demand
and
live
until
you
get
back
home
enjoying
meanwhile
your
life
and
whatever
chance
you
think
you
may
have
of
being
liberated
within
the
atmosphere
of
your
own
planet
just
a
minute
chief
loring
said
in
english
his
back
to
the
prisoner
would
we
gain
more
by
killing
him
and
going
back
to
seaton
and
the
green
system
as
you
suggested
no
duquesne
also
turned
away
to
shield
his
features
from
the
gaze
of
the
fenachrone
that
was
pure
bluff
i
do
want
to
get
within
a
million
miles
of
seaton
until
after
we
have
the
armament
of
this
fellow
ships
i
could
make
peace
with
seaton
now
even
if
i
wanted
to
and
i
have
the
slightest
intention
of
trying
i
intend
killing
him
on
sight
here
what
we
going
to
do
first
we
get
what
we
came
after
then
we
find
the
and
blow
her
clear
out
of
space
and
take
over
the
pieces
of
that
fenachrone
ship
after
that
we
head
for
the
green
system
and
with
their
own
stuff
and
what
we
give
them
they
be
able
to
give
those
fiends
a
hot
reception
by
the
time
they
finally
destroy
the
osnomians
if
they
do
we
have
the
world
ready
for
them
he
turned
to
the
fenachrone
what
is
your
decision
i
submit
in
the
hope
that
you
will
keep
your
promise
since
there
is
no
alternative
but
death
and
the
awful
creature
still
loosely
held
by
the
attractors
and
carefully
watched
by
duquesne
and
loring
fairly
tore
into
the
task
of
rebuilding
the
osnomian
into
the
drive
of
the
fenachrone
for
he
well
knew
one
fact
that
duquesne
hurried
inspection
had
failed
to
glean
from
the
labyrinthine
intricacies
of
that
fearsome
brain
that
once
within
the
detector
screens
of
that
distant
solar
system
these
would
be
utterly
helpless
before
the
forces
which
would
inevitably
be
turned
upon
them
also
he
realized
that
time
was
precious
and
resolved
to
drive
the
so
unmercifully
that
she
would
overtake
that
fleeing
torpedo
now
many
hours
upon
its
way
the
torpedo
bearing
news
for
the
first
time
in
fenachrone
history
of
the
overwhelming
defeat
and
capture
of
one
of
its
mighty
engines
of
interstellar
war
in
a
very
short
time
considering
the
complexity
of
the
undertaking
the
conversion
of
the
was
done
and
the
repellers
already
supposed
the
ultimate
in
protection
were
reenforced
by
a
mass
of
activated
copper
effective
for
untold
millions
of
miles
their
monstrous
pilot
then
set
the
bar
and
advanced
both
levers
of
the
dual
power
control
out
to
the
extreme
limit
of
their
travel
there
was
no
sense
of
motion
or
of
acceleration
since
the
new
system
of
propulsion
acted
upon
every
molecule
of
matter
within
the
radius
of
activity
of
the
bar
which
had
been
set
to
include
the
entire
hull
the
passengers
felt
only
the
utter
lack
of
all
weight
and
the
other
peculiar
sensations
with
which
they
were
already
familiar
as
each
had
had
previous
experience
of
free
motion
in
space
but
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
apparent
motion
the
was
now
leaping
through
the
unfathomable
depths
of
interstellar
space
with
the
unthinkable
speed
of
five
times
the
velocity
of
light
chapter
viii
the
of
dasor
how
long
do
you
figure
it
going
to
take
us
to
get
there
mart
seaton
asked
from
a
corner
where
he
was
bending
over
his
about
three
days
at
this
acceleration
i
set
it
at
what
i
thought
the
safe
maximum
for
the
girls
should
we
increase
it
probably
not
three
days
is
bad
anyway
to
save
even
one
day
have
to
more
than
double
the
acceleration
and
none
of
us
could
do
anything
so
we
better
let
it
ride
how
you
making
it
peg
i
getting
used
to
weighing
a
ton
now
my
knees
buckled
only
once
this
morning
from
my
forgetting
to
watch
them
when
i
tried
to
walk
do
let
me
interfere
though
if
i
am
slowing
us
down
i
go
to
bed
and
stay
there
it
hardly
pay
said
seaton
we
can
use
the
time
to
good
advantage
look
here
mart
i
been
looking
over
this
stuff
i
got
out
of
their
ship
and
here
something
i
know
you
eat
up
they
refer
to
it
as
a
chart
but
it
and
almost
incredible
i
ca
say
that
i
understand
it
but
i
get
an
awful
kick
out
of
looking
at
it
been
studying
it
a
couple
of
hours
and
have
started
yet
i
found
our
solar
system
the
green
one
or
their
own
it
too
heavy
to
move
around
now
because
of
the
acceleration
we
using
come
on
over
here
and
give
it
a
look
the
chart
was
a
strip
of
some
material
or
film
apparently
miles
in
length
wound
upon
reels
at
each
end
of
the
machine
one
section
of
the
film
was
always
under
the
viewing
mechanism
an
optical
system
projecting
an
undistorted
image
into
a
visiplate
plate
somewhat
similar
to
their
own
and
at
the
touch
of
a
lever
a
small
atomic
motor
turned
the
reels
and
moved
the
film
through
the
projector
it
was
not
an
ordinary
it
was
the
eye
did
not
perceive
a
flat
surface
but
beheld
an
actual
extremely
narrow
wedge
of
space
as
seen
from
the
center
of
the
galaxy
each
of
the
closer
stars
was
seen
in
its
true
position
in
space
and
in
its
true
perspective
and
each
was
clearly
identified
by
number
in
the
background
were
faint
stars
and
nebulous
masses
of
light
too
distant
to
be
resolved
into
separate
stars
a
true
representation
of
the
actual
sky
as
both
men
stared
fascinated
into
the
visiplate
seaton
touched
the
lever
and
they
apparently
traveled
directly
along
the
center
line
of
that
wedge
as
they
proceeded
the
nearer
stars
grew
brighter
and
larger
soon
becoming
suns
with
their
planets
and
then
the
satellites
of
the
planets
plainly
visible
and
finally
passing
out
of
the
picture
behind
the
observers
the
fainter
stars
became
bright
grew
into
suns
and
solar
systems
and
were
passed
in
turn
the
chart
unrolled
and
the
nebulous
masses
of
light
were
approached
became
composed
of
faint
stars
which
developed
as
had
the
others
and
were
passed
finally
when
the
picture
filled
the
entire
visiplate
they
arrived
at
the
outermost
edge
of
the
galaxy
no
more
stars
were
visible
they
saw
empty
space
stretching
for
inconceivably
vast
distances
before
them
but
beyond
that
indescribable
and
incomprehensible
vacuum
they
saw
faint
lenticular
bodies
of
light
which
were
also
named
and
which
each
man
knew
to
be
other
galaxies
charted
and
named
by
the
almost
unlimited
power
of
the
fenachrone
astronomers
but
not
as
yet
explored
as
the
magic
scroll
unrolled
still
farther
they
found
themselves
back
in
the
center
of
the
galaxy
starting
outward
in
the
wedge
adjacent
to
the
one
which
they
had
just
traversed
seaton
cut
off
the
motor
and
wiped
his
forehead
would
that
break
you
off
at
the
ankles
mart
did
you
ever
conceive
the
possibility
of
such
a
thing
it
would
and
i
did
not
there
are
literally
miles
and
miles
of
film
in
each
of
those
reels
and
i
see
that
there
is
a
magazine
full
of
reels
in
the
cabinet
there
must
be
an
index
or
a
yeah
there
a
book
in
this
slot
here
said
seaton
but
we
know
any
of
their
names
or
numbers
wait
a
minute
how
did
he
report
our
earth
on
that
torpedo
planet
number
three
of
sun
six
four
something
pilarone
was
it
i
get
the
record
six
four
seven
three
pilarone
it
was
pilarone
let
see
seaton
studied
the
index
volume
reel
twenty
scene
i
translate
it
they
found
the
reel
and
scene
did
indeed
show
that
section
of
space
in
which
our
solar
system
is
seaton
stopped
the
chart
when
star
six
four
seven
three
was
at
its
closest
range
and
there
was
our
sun
with
its
nine
planets
and
their
many
satellites
accurately
shown
and
correctly
described
they
know
their
stuff
all
right
you
got
to
hand
it
to
been
straightening
out
that
brain
record
cutting
out
the
hazy
stretches
and
getting
his
knowledge
straightened
out
so
we
can
use
it
and
a
lot
of
this
kind
of
stuff
in
the
record
you
can
get
suppose
that
you
can
figure
out
exactly
where
he
comes
from
with
this
dope
and
with
his
brain
record
certainly
i
may
be
able
to
get
more
complete
information
upon
the
green
system
than
the
osnomians
have
which
will
be
very
useful
indeed
you
are
right
i
am
intensely
interested
in
this
material
and
if
you
do
not
care
particularly
about
studying
it
any
more
at
this
time
i
believe
that
i
should
begin
to
study
it
now
hop
to
it
i
going
to
study
that
record
some
more
no
human
brain
can
take
it
all
i
afraid
especially
all
at
once
but
i
going
to
kinda
peck
around
the
edges
and
get
me
some
dope
that
i
want
pretty
badly
we
got
a
lot
of
stuff
from
that
wampus
about
sixty
hours
out
dorothy
who
had
been
observing
the
planet
through
number
six
visiplate
called
seaton
away
from
the
fenachrone
upon
which
he
was
still
concentrating
come
here
a
minute
dickie
have
you
got
that
knowledge
all
packed
away
in
your
skull
yet
i
say
i
have
that
bird
brain
would
make
a
dozen
of
mine
and
it
was
loaded
until
the
scuppers
were
awash
i
just
nibbling
around
the
edges
yet
i
always
heard
that
the
capacity
of
even
the
human
brain
was
almost
infinite
is
that
true
asked
margaret
maybe
it
is
if
the
knowledge
were
built
up
gradually
over
generations
i
think
maybe
i
can
get
most
of
this
stuff
into
my
peanut
brain
so
i
can
use
it
but
it
going
to
be
an
awful
job
is
their
brain
really
as
far
ahead
of
ours
as
i
gathered
from
what
i
saw
of
it
asked
crane
it
sure
is
replied
seaton
as
far
as
knowledge
and
intelligence
are
concerned
but
they
have
nothing
else
in
common
with
us
they
belong
to
the
genus
at
all
really
instead
of
having
a
common
ancestor
with
the
anthropoids
as
they
say
we
had
they
evolved
from
a
genus
which
combined
the
worst
traits
of
the
cat
tribe
and
the
carnivorous
lizards
the
most
savage
and
bloodthirsty
branches
of
the
animal
kingdom
and
instead
of
getting
better
as
they
went
along
they
got
worse
in
that
respect
at
least
but
they
sure
do
know
something
when
you
get
a
month
or
so
to
spare
you
want
to
put
on
this
harness
and
grab
his
knowledge
being
very
careful
to
steer
clear
of
his
mental
traits
and
so
on
then
when
we
get
back
to
the
earth
we
simply
tear
it
apart
and
rebuild
it
you
know
what
i
mean
when
you
get
this
stuff
transplanted
into
your
own
skull
but
to
cut
out
the
lecture
what
on
your
mind
dottie
dimple
this
planet
martin
picked
out
is
all
wet
literally
the
visibility
is
fine
very
few
clouds
but
this
whole
half
of
it
is
solid
ocean
if
there
are
any
islands
even
they
mighty
small
all
four
looked
into
the
receiver
with
the
great
magnification
employed
the
planet
almost
filled
the
visiplate
there
were
a
few
fleecy
wisps
of
cloud
but
the
entire
surface
upon
which
they
gazed
was
one
sheet
of
the
now
familiar
deep
and
glorious
blue
peculiar
to
the
waters
of
that
cuprous
solar
system
with
no
markings
whatever
what
make
of
it
mart
that
water
all
right
solution
just
like
the
osnomian
and
urvanian
oceans
and
nothing
else
visible
how
big
would
an
island
have
to
be
for
us
to
see
it
from
here
so
much
depends
upon
the
contour
and
nature
of
the
island
that
it
is
hard
to
say
if
it
were
low
and
heavily
covered
with
their
vegetation
we
might
not
be
able
to
see
even
a
rather
large
one
whereas
if
it
were
hilly
and
bare
we
could
probably
see
one
only
a
few
miles
in
diameter
well
one
good
thing
anyway
we
approaching
it
from
the
central
sun
and
almost
in
line
with
their
own
sun
so
it
daylight
all
over
it
as
it
turns
and
as
we
get
closer
we
see
what
we
can
see
better
take
turns
watching
it
had
we
asked
seaton
it
was
decided
and
while
the
was
still
some
distance
away
several
small
islands
became
visible
and
the
period
of
rotation
of
the
planet
was
determined
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
fifty
hours
margaret
then
at
the
controls
picked
out
the
largest
island
visible
and
directed
the
bar
toward
it
as
they
dropped
down
close
to
their
objective
they
found
that
the
air
was
of
the
same
composition
as
that
of
osnome
but
had
a
pressure
of
centimeters
of
mercury
and
that
the
surface
gravity
of
the
planet
was
hundredths
that
of
the
earth
fine
business
exulted
seaton
just
about
like
home
but
i
do
see
much
of
any
place
to
land
without
getting
wet
do
you
those
reflectors
are
probably
solar
generators
and
they
cover
the
whole
island
except
for
that
lagoon
right
under
us
the
island
perhaps
ten
miles
long
and
half
that
in
width
was
entirely
covered
with
great
parabolic
reflectors
arranged
so
closely
together
that
little
could
be
seen
between
them
each
reflector
apparently
focussed
upon
an
object
in
the
center
a
helix
which
seemed
to
writhe
luridly
in
that
flaming
focus
glowing
with
a
nacreous
opalescent
green
light
well
nothing
much
to
see
there
let
go
down
remarked
seaton
as
he
shot
the
over
to
the
edge
of
the
island
and
down
to
the
surface
of
the
water
but
here
again
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
the
land
itself
the
wall
was
one
vertical
plate
of
seamless
metal
supporting
huge
metal
guides
between
which
floated
metal
pontoons
from
these
gigantic
floats
metal
girders
and
trusses
went
through
slots
in
the
wall
into
the
darkness
of
the
interior
close
scrutiny
revealed
that
the
large
floats
were
rising
steadily
although
very
slowly
while
smaller
floats
bobbed
up
and
down
upon
each
passing
wave
solar
generators
and
all
at
once
ejaculated
seaton
folks
i
going
to
take
a
look
at
that
if
i
have
to
drill
in
with
a
ray
illustration
some
power
plant
folks
i
going
to
take
a
look
at
that
they
circumnavigated
the
island
without
revealing
any
door
or
other
opening
the
entire
thirty
miles
was
one
stupendous
battery
of
the
generators
back
at
the
starting
point
the
hopped
over
the
structure
and
down
to
the
surface
of
the
small
central
lagoon
previously
noticed
close
to
the
water
it
was
seen
that
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
the
vessel
to
move
about
beneath
the
roof
of
reflectors
and
that
the
island
was
one
solid
stand
of
at
one
end
of
the
lagoon
was
an
open
metal
structure
the
only
building
visible
and
seaton
brought
the
up
to
it
and
through
the
huge
opening
for
door
there
was
none
the
interior
of
the
room
was
lighted
by
long
tubular
lights
running
around
in
front
of
the
walls
which
were
veritable
switchboards
row
after
row
and
tier
upon
tier
stood
the
instruments
plainly
electrical
meters
of
enormous
capacity
and
equally
plainly
in
full
operation
but
no
wiring
or
could
be
seen
before
each
row
of
instruments
there
was
a
narrow
walk
with
steps
leading
down
into
the
water
of
the
lagoon
every
part
of
the
great
room
was
plainly
visible
and
not
a
living
being
was
even
watching
that
vast
what
do
you
make
of
it
dick
asked
crane
slowly
no
wiring
tight
beam
transmission
the
fenachrone
do
it
with
two
separable
units
millions
and
millions
of
kilowatts
there
if
i
any
judge
absolutely
automatic
too
or
else
voice
died
away
or
else
what
asked
dorothy
just
a
hunch
i
would
wonder
if
hold
it
dicky
remember
i
had
to
put
you
to
bed
after
that
last
hunch
you
had
here
it
is
anyway
mart
what
would
be
the
logical
line
of
evolution
when
the
planet
has
become
so
old
that
all
the
land
has
been
eroded
to
a
level
below
that
of
the
ocean
you
picked
us
out
an
old
one
all
right
so
old
that
there
no
land
left
would
a
highly
civilized
people
revert
to
fish
that
seems
like
a
backward
move
to
me
but
what
other
answer
is
possible
probably
not
to
true
fishes
although
they
might
easily
develop
some
traits
i
do
not
believe
however
that
they
would
go
back
to
gills
or
to
cold
blood
what
you
two
saying
interrupted
margaret
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
think
live
here
instead
of
people
and
that
did
all
this
as
she
waved
her
hand
at
the
complicated
machinery
about
them
not
fish
exactly
no
crane
paused
in
thought
merely
a
people
who
have
adjusted
themselves
to
their
environment
through
conscious
or
natural
selection
we
had
a
talk
about
this
very
thing
in
our
first
trip
shortly
after
i
met
you
remember
i
commented
on
the
fact
that
there
must
be
life
throughout
the
universe
much
of
it
that
we
could
not
understand
and
you
replied
that
there
would
be
no
reason
to
suppose
them
awful
because
incomprehensible
that
may
be
the
case
here
well
i
going
to
find
out
declared
seaton
as
he
appeared
with
a
box
full
of
coils
tubes
and
other
apparatus
how
asked
dorothy
curiously
fix
me
up
a
detector
and
follow
up
one
of
those
beams
find
its
frequency
and
direction
first
you
know
then
pick
it
up
outside
and
follow
it
to
where
it
going
it
go
through
anything
of
course
but
i
can
trap
off
enough
of
it
to
follow
it
even
if
it
tight
enough
to
choke
itself
said
seaton
that
one
thing
i
got
from
that
brain
record
he
worked
deftly
and
rapidly
and
soon
was
rewarded
by
a
flaring
crimson
color
in
his
detector
when
it
was
located
in
one
certain
position
in
front
of
one
of
the
meters
noting
the
bearing
on
the
great
circles
he
then
moved
the
along
that
exact
line
over
the
reflectors
and
out
beyond
the
island
where
he
allowed
the
vessel
to
settle
directly
downwards
now
folks
if
i
done
this
just
right
we
get
a
red
flash
directly
as
he
spoke
the
detector
again
burst
into
crimson
light
and
he
set
the
bar
into
the
line
and
applied
a
little
power
keeping
the
light
at
its
reddest
while
the
other
three
looked
on
in
fascinated
interest
this
beam
is
on
something
that
moving
mart
ca
take
my
eyes
off
it
for
a
second
or
i
lose
it
entirely
see
where
we
going
will
you
we
are
about
to
strike
the
water
replied
crane
quietly
the
water
exclaimed
margaret
fair
enough
why
not
oh
that
right
i
forgot
that
the
is
as
good
a
submarine
as
she
is
an
airship
crane
pointed
number
six
visiplate
directly
into
the
line
of
flight
and
started
into
the
dark
water
mow
deep
are
we
mart
asked
seaton
after
a
time
only
about
a
hundred
feet
and
we
do
not
seem
to
be
getting
any
deeper
that
good
afraid
this
beam
might
be
going
to
a
station
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
through
the
ground
if
so
we
have
had
to
go
back
and
trace
another
we
can
follow
it
any
distance
under
water
but
not
through
rock
need
a
light
not
unless
we
go
deeper
for
two
hours
seaton
held
the
detector
upon
that
tight
beam
of
energy
traveling
at
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
the
highest
speed
he
could
use
and
still
hold
the
beam
i
like
to
be
up
above
watching
us
i
bet
we
making
the
water
boil
behind
us
remarked
dorothy
yeah
we
kicking
up
quite
a
wake
i
guess
it
sure
takes
power
to
drive
the
old
can
through
this
wetness
slow
down
commanded
crane
i
see
a
submarine
ahead
i
thought
it
might
be
a
whale
at
first
but
it
is
a
boat
and
it
is
what
we
are
aiming
for
you
are
constantly
swinging
with
it
keeping
it
exactly
in
the
line
seaton
reduced
the
power
and
swung
the
visiplate
over
in
front
of
him
whereupon
the
detector
lamp
went
out
it
a
relief
to
follow
something
i
can
see
instead
of
trying
to
guess
which
way
that
going
to
wiggle
next
lead
on
macduff
i
right
on
your
tail
the
fell
in
behind
the
submersible
craft
close
enough
to
keep
it
plainly
visible
in
the
telescopic
visiplate
finally
the
stranger
stopped
and
rose
to
the
surface
between
two
rows
of
submerged
pontoons
which
row
upon
row
extended
in
every
direction
as
far
as
the
telescope
could
reach
well
dot
we
where
we
going
wherever
that
is
what
do
you
suppose
it
is
it
looks
like
a
floating
isleport
like
what
it
told
about
in
that
magazine
you
read
so
much
maybe
but
if
so
they
ca
be
fish
answered
seaton
let
go
i
want
to
look
it
over
and
water
flew
in
all
directions
as
the
burst
out
of
the
ocean
and
leaped
into
the
air
far
above
what
was
in
truth
a
floating
city
rectangular
in
shape
it
appeared
to
be
about
six
miles
long
and
four
wide
it
was
roofed
with
solar
generators
like
those
covering
the
island
just
visited
but
the
machines
were
not
spaced
quite
so
closely
together
and
there
were
numerous
open
lagoons
the
water
around
the
entire
city
was
covered
with
from
their
great
height
the
visitors
could
see
an
occasional
submarine
moving
slowly
under
the
city
and
frequently
small
surface
craft
dashed
across
the
lagoons
as
they
watched
a
seaplane
with
short
thick
wings
curved
like
those
of
a
gull
rose
from
one
of
the
lagoons
and
shot
away
over
the
water
quite
a
place
remarked
seaton
as
he
swung
a
visiplate
upon
one
of
the
lagoons
submarines
speedboats
and
fast
seaplanes
fish
or
not
they
not
so
slow
i
going
to
grab
off
one
of
those
folks
and
see
how
much
they
know
wonder
if
they
peaceable
or
warlike
they
look
peaceable
but
you
know
the
proverb
crane
cautioned
his
impetuous
friend
yes
and
i
going
to
be
timid
like
a
mice
seaton
returned
as
the
dropped
rapidly
toward
a
lagoon
near
the
edge
of
the
island
you
ought
to
put
that
in
a
gag
book
dick
dorothy
chuckled
you
forget
all
about
being
timid
until
an
hour
afterwards
watch
me
if
they
even
point
a
finger
at
us
i
going
to
run
a
million
miles
a
minute
no
hostile
demonstration
was
made
as
they
dropped
lower
and
lower
however
and
seaton
with
one
hand
upon
the
switch
actuating
the
zone
of
force
slowly
lowered
the
vessel
down
past
the
reflectors
and
to
the
surface
of
the
water
through
the
visiplate
he
saw
the
crowd
of
people
coming
toward
them
some
swimming
in
the
lagoon
some
walking
along
narrow
runways
they
seemed
to
be
of
all
sizes
and
unarmed
i
believe
they
perfectly
peaceable
and
just
curious
mart
already
got
the
repellers
on
close
range
believe
i
cut
them
off
altogether
how
about
the
all
three
full
out
they
do
interfere
with
anything
solid
though
and
wo
hurt
anything
they
stop
any
ray
attack
and
this
arenak
hull
will
stop
anything
else
we
are
apt
to
get
there
watch
this
board
will
you
and
i
see
if
i
ca
negotiate
with
them
seaton
opened
the
door
as
he
did
so
a
number
of
the
smaller
beings
dived
headlong
into
the
water
and
a
submarine
rose
quietly
to
the
surface
less
than
fifty
feet
away
with
a
peculiar
tubular
weapon
and
a
huge
trained
upon
the
seaton
stood
motionless
his
right
hand
raised
in
the
universal
sign
of
peace
his
left
holding
at
his
hip
an
automatic
pistol
charged
with
shells
while
crane
at
the
controls
had
the
fenachrone
in
line
and
his
hand
lay
upon
the
switch
whose
closing
would
volatilize
the
submarine
and
cut
an
incandescent
path
of
destruction
through
the
city
lengthwise
after
a
moment
of
inaction
a
hatch
opened
a
man
stepped
out
upon
the
deck
of
the
submarine
and
the
two
tried
to
converse
but
with
no
success
seaton
then
brought
out
the
mechanical
educator
held
it
up
for
the
other
inspection
and
waved
an
invitation
to
come
aboard
instantly
the
other
dived
and
came
to
the
surface
immediately
below
seaton
who
assisted
him
into
the
tall
and
heavy
as
seaton
was
the
stranger
was
half
a
head
taller
and
almost
twice
as
heavy
his
thick
skin
was
of
the
characteristic
osnomian
green
and
his
eyes
were
the
usual
black
but
he
had
no
hair
whatever
his
shoulders
though
broad
and
enormously
strong
were
very
sloping
and
his
powerful
arms
were
little
more
than
half
as
long
as
would
have
been
expected
had
they
belonged
to
a
human
being
of
his
size
the
hands
and
feet
were
very
large
and
very
broad
and
the
fingers
and
toes
were
heavily
webbed
his
high
domed
forehead
appeared
even
higher
because
of
the
total
lack
of
hair
otherwise
his
features
were
regular
and
he
carried
himself
easily
and
gracefully
and
yet
with
the
dignity
of
one
accustomed
to
command
as
he
stepped
into
the
control
room
and
saluted
gravely
the
three
other
he
glanced
quickly
around
the
room
and
showed
unmistakable
pleasure
as
he
saw
the
of
the
cruiser
of
space
languages
were
soon
exchanged
and
the
stranger
spoke
in
a
bass
voice
vastly
deeper
than
seaton
own
in
the
name
of
our
city
and
planet
i
may
say
in
the
name
of
our
solar
system
for
you
are
very
evidently
from
one
other
than
our
green
system
i
greet
you
i
would
offer
you
refreshment
as
is
our
custom
but
i
fear
that
your
chemistry
is
but
ill
adapted
to
our
customary
fare
if
there
be
aught
in
which
we
can
be
of
assistance
to
you
our
resources
are
at
your
disposal
but
before
you
leave
us
i
shall
wish
to
ask
from
you
a
great
gift
sir
we
thank
you
we
are
in
search
of
knowledge
concerning
forces
which
we
can
not
as
yet
control
from
the
power
systems
you
employ
and
from
what
i
have
learned
of
the
composition
of
your
suns
and
planets
i
assume
you
have
none
of
the
metal
of
power
and
it
is
a
quantity
of
that
element
that
is
your
greatest
need
yes
power
is
our
only
lack
we
generate
all
we
can
with
the
materials
and
knowledge
at
our
disposal
but
we
never
have
enough
our
development
is
hindered
our
must
be
held
down
to
a
minimum
many
new
cities
which
we
need
can
not
be
built
and
many
new
projects
can
not
be
started
all
for
lack
of
power
for
one
gram
of
that
metal
i
see
plated
upon
that
copper
cylinder
of
whose
very
existence
no
scientist
upon
dasor
has
had
even
an
inkling
we
would
do
almost
anything
in
fact
if
all
else
failed
i
would
be
tempted
to
attack
you
did
i
not
know
that
our
utmost
power
could
not
penetrate
even
your
outer
screen
and
that
you
could
volatilize
the
entire
planet
if
you
so
desired
great
cat
in
his
surprise
seaton
lapsed
from
the
formal
language
he
had
been
employing
have
you
figured
us
all
out
already
from
a
standing
start
we
know
electricity
chemistry
physics
and
mathematics
fairly
well
you
see
our
race
is
many
millions
of
years
older
than
is
yours
you
the
man
i
been
looking
for
i
guess
said
seaton
we
have
enough
of
this
metal
with
us
so
that
we
can
spare
you
some
as
well
as
not
but
before
you
get
it
i
introduce
you
folks
this
is
sacner
carfon
chief
of
the
council
of
the
planet
dasor
they
saw
us
all
the
time
and
when
we
headed
for
this
the
sixth
city
he
came
over
from
the
capital
or
first
city
in
the
flagship
of
his
police
fleet
to
welcome
us
or
to
fight
us
as
we
pleased
carfon
this
is
martin
crane
or
say
better
than
introductions
put
on
the
headsets
everybody
and
get
acquainted
right
acquaintance
made
and
the
apparatus
put
away
seaton
went
to
one
of
the
and
brought
out
a
lump
of
x
weighing
about
a
hundred
pounds
there
enough
to
build
from
now
on
it
would
save
time
if
you
were
to
dismiss
your
submarine
with
you
to
pilot
us
we
can
take
you
back
to
the
first
city
a
lot
faster
than
your
vessel
can
travel
carfon
took
a
miniature
transmitter
from
a
pouch
under
his
arm
and
spoke
briefly
then
gave
seaton
the
course
in
a
few
minutes
the
first
city
was
reached
and
the
descended
rapidly
to
the
surface
of
a
lagoon
at
one
end
of
the
city
short
as
had
been
the
time
consumed
by
their
journey
from
the
sixth
city
they
found
a
curious
and
excited
crowd
awaiting
them
the
central
portion
of
the
lagoon
was
almost
covered
by
the
small
surface
craft
while
the
sides
separated
from
the
sidewalks
by
the
curbs
were
full
of
swimmers
the
peculiar
dasorian
equivalents
of
whistles
bells
and
gongs
were
making
a
deafening
uproar
and
the
crowd
was
yelling
and
cheering
in
much
the
same
fashion
as
do
earthly
crowds
upon
similar
occasions
seaton
stopped
the
and
took
his
wife
by
the
shoulder
swinging
her
around
in
front
of
the
visiplate
look
at
that
dot
talk
about
rapid
transit
they
could
give
the
new
york
subway
a
flying
start
and
beat
them
hands
down
dorothy
looked
into
the
visiplate
and
gasped
six
metal
pipes
one
above
the
other
ran
above
and
parallel
to
each
of
water
the
pipes
were
full
of
ocean
water
water
racing
along
at
fully
fifty
miles
an
hour
and
discharging
each
stream
a
small
waterfall
into
the
lagoon
each
pipe
was
lighted
in
the
interior
and
each
was
full
of
people
heads
almost
touching
feet
unconcernedly
being
borne
along
completely
immersed
in
that
mad
current
as
the
passenger
saw
daylight
and
felt
the
stream
begin
to
drop
he
righted
himself
apparently
selecting
an
objective
point
and
rode
the
current
down
into
the
ocean
a
few
quick
strokes
and
he
was
either
at
the
surface
or
upon
one
of
the
flights
of
stairs
leading
up
to
the
platform
many
of
the
travelers
did
not
even
move
as
they
left
the
orifice
if
they
happened
to
be
on
their
backs
they
entered
the
ocean
backward
and
did
not
bother
about
righting
themselves
or
about
selecting
a
destination
until
they
were
many
feet
below
the
surface
good
heavens
dick
they
kill
themselves
or
drown
not
these
birds
notice
their
skins
they
got
a
hide
like
a
walrus
and
a
terrific
layer
of
subcutaneous
fat
even
their
heads
are
protected
that
way
you
could
hardly
hit
one
of
them
enough
with
a
baseball
bat
to
hurt
him
and
as
for
drowning
they
can
a
fish
and
can
stay
under
water
almost
an
hour
without
coming
up
for
air
even
one
of
those
youngsters
can
swim
the
full
length
of
the
city
without
taking
a
breath
how
do
you
get
that
velocity
of
flow
carfon
asked
crane
by
means
of
pumps
these
channels
run
all
over
the
city
and
the
amount
of
water
running
in
each
tube
and
the
number
of
tubes
in
use
are
regulated
automatically
by
the
amount
of
traffic
when
any
section
of
tube
is
empty
of
people
no
water
flows
through
it
this
was
necessary
in
order
to
save
power
at
each
intersection
there
are
four
stand
pipes
and
automatic
that
regulate
the
volume
of
water
and
the
number
of
tubes
in
use
this
is
ordinarily
a
quiet
pool
as
it
is
in
a
residence
section
and
this
channel
our
channels
correspond
to
your
streets
you
know
has
only
six
tubes
each
way
if
you
will
look
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
you
will
see
the
intake
end
of
the
tubes
going
seaton
swung
the
visiplate
around
and
they
saw
six
stairways
each
crowded
with
people
leading
from
the
ocean
level
up
to
the
top
of
a
tall
metal
tower
as
the
passengers
reached
the
top
of
the
flight
they
were
catapulted
into
the
chamber
leading
to
the
tube
below
well
that
is
some
system
for
handling
people
exclaimed
seaton
what
the
capacity
of
the
system
when
running
full
pressure
six
tubes
will
handle
five
thousand
people
a
minute
it
is
only
very
rarely
on
such
occasions
as
this
that
they
are
ever
loaded
to
capacity
some
of
the
channels
in
the
middle
of
the
city
have
as
many
as
twenty
tubes
so
that
it
is
always
possible
to
go
from
one
end
of
the
city
to
the
other
in
less
than
ten
minutes
do
they
ever
jam
asked
dorothy
curiously
i
been
lost
more
than
once
in
the
new
york
subway
and
been
in
some
perfectly
frightful
jams
too
and
they
were
moving
ten
thousand
people
a
minute
either
no
jams
ever
have
occurred
the
tubes
are
perfectly
smooth
and
and
all
turns
and
intersections
are
rounded
the
controlling
machines
allow
only
so
many
persons
to
enter
any
tube
if
more
should
try
to
enter
than
can
be
carried
comfortably
the
surplus
passengers
are
slid
off
down
a
chute
to
the
or
sidewalks
and
may
either
wait
a
while
or
swim
to
the
next
intersection
that
looks
like
quite
a
jam
down
there
now
seaton
pointed
to
the
receiving
pool
which
was
now
one
solid
mass
except
for
the
space
kept
clear
by
the
six
mighty
streams
of
water
if
the
newcomers
ca
find
room
to
come
to
the
surface
they
swim
over
to
some
other
pool
carfon
shrugged
indifferently
my
residence
is
the
fifth
cubicle
on
the
right
side
of
this
channel
our
custom
demands
that
you
accept
the
hospitality
of
my
home
if
only
for
a
moment
and
only
for
a
beaker
of
distilled
water
any
ordinary
visitor
could
be
received
in
my
office
but
you
must
enter
my
home
seaton
steered
the
carefully
surrounded
as
she
was
by
a
tightly
packed
crowd
of
swimmers
to
the
indicated
dwelling
and
anchored
her
so
that
one
of
the
doors
was
close
to
a
flight
of
steps
leading
from
the
corner
of
the
building
down
into
the
water
carfon
stepped
out
opened
the
door
of
his
house
and
preceded
his
guests
within
the
room
was
large
and
square
and
built
of
a
synthetic
metal
as
was
the
entire
city
the
walls
were
tastefully
decorated
with
striking
geometrical
designs
in
metal
and
upon
the
floor
was
a
softly
woven
rug
three
doors
leading
into
other
rooms
could
be
seen
and
strange
pieces
of
furniture
stood
here
and
there
in
the
center
of
the
was
a
circular
opening
some
four
feet
in
diameter
and
there
only
a
few
inches
below
the
level
of
the
floor
was
the
surface
of
the
ocean
carfon
introduced
his
guests
to
his
wife
a
feminine
replica
of
himself
although
she
was
not
of
quite
such
heroic
proportions
i
do
suppose
that
seven
is
far
away
is
he
carfon
asked
of
the
woman
probably
he
is
outside
near
the
flying
ball
if
he
has
not
been
touching
it
ever
since
it
came
down
it
is
only
because
someone
stronger
than
he
pushed
him
aside
you
know
how
boys
are
turning
to
dorothy
with
a
smile
as
she
spoke
boy
nature
is
probably
universal
pardon
my
curiosity
but
why
asked
dorothy
as
she
returned
the
smile
he
is
the
two
thousand
three
hundred
and
sacner
carfon
in
direct
male
line
of
descent
she
explained
but
perhaps
six
has
not
explained
these
things
to
you
our
population
must
not
be
allowed
to
increase
therefore
each
couple
can
have
only
two
children
it
is
customary
for
the
boy
to
be
born
first
and
is
given
the
name
of
his
father
the
girl
is
younger
and
is
given
her
mother
name
that
will
now
be
changed
said
carfon
feelingly
these
visitors
have
given
us
the
secret
of
power
and
we
shall
be
able
to
build
new
cities
and
populate
dasor
as
she
should
he
populated
really
she
checked
herself
but
a
flame
leaped
to
her
eyes
and
her
voice
was
none
too
steady
as
she
addressed
the
visitors
for
that
we
dasorians
thank
you
more
than
words
can
express
perhaps
you
strangers
do
not
know
what
it
means
to
want
a
dozen
children
with
every
fiber
of
your
being
and
to
be
allowed
to
have
only
two
we
do
all
too
well
i
will
call
seven
she
pressed
a
button
and
up
out
of
the
opening
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
there
shot
a
boy
swimming
so
rapidly
that
he
scarcely
touched
the
coaming
as
he
came
to
his
feet
he
glanced
at
the
four
visitors
then
ran
up
to
seaton
and
crane
please
sirs
may
i
ride
just
a
little
short
ride
in
your
vessel
before
you
go
away
this
was
said
in
their
language
seven
boomed
carfon
sternly
and
the
exuberant
youth
subsided
pardon
me
sirs
but
i
was
so
excited
all
right
son
no
harm
done
at
all
you
bet
you
have
a
ride
in
the
if
your
parents
will
let
you
he
turned
to
carfon
i
not
so
far
beyond
that
stage
myself
that
i
not
in
sympathy
with
him
neither
are
you
unless
i
badly
mistaken
i
am
very
glad
that
you
feel
as
you
do
he
would
be
delighted
to
accompany
us
down
to
the
office
and
it
will
be
something
to
remember
all
the
rest
of
his
life
you
have
a
little
girl
too
dorothy
asked
the
woman
yes
would
you
like
to
see
her
she
is
asleep
now
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
the
proud
dasorian
mother
led
the
way
into
a
bedroom
a
bedroom
without
beds
for
dasorians
sleep
floating
in
thermostatically
controlled
tanks
buoyed
up
in
water
of
the
temperature
they
like
best
in
a
fashion
that
no
earthly
springs
and
mattresses
can
approach
in
a
small
tank
in
a
corner
reposed
a
baby
apparently
about
a
year
old
over
whom
dorothy
and
margaret
made
the
usual
feminine
ceremony
of
delight
and
approbation
back
in
the
living
room
after
an
animated
conversation
in
which
much
information
was
exchanged
concerning
the
two
planets
and
their
races
of
peoples
carfon
drew
six
metal
goblets
of
distilled
water
and
passed
them
around
standing
in
a
circle
the
six
touched
goblets
and
drank
they
then
embarked
and
while
crane
steered
the
slowly
along
the
channel
toward
the
offices
of
the
council
and
while
dorothy
and
margaret
showed
the
eager
seven
all
over
the
vessel
seaton
explained
to
carfon
the
danger
that
threatened
the
universe
what
he
had
done
and
what
he
was
attempting
to
do
doctor
seaton
i
wish
to
apologize
to
you
the
dasorian
said
when
seaton
had
done
since
you
are
evidently
still
land
animals
i
had
supposed
you
of
inferior
intelligence
it
is
true
that
your
younger
civilization
is
deficient
in
certain
respects
but
you
have
shown
a
depth
of
vision
a
sheer
power
of
imagination
and
grasp
that
no
member
of
our
older
civilization
could
approach
i
believe
that
you
are
right
in
your
conclusions
we
have
no
such
rays
nor
forces
upon
this
planet
and
never
have
had
but
the
sixth
planet
of
our
own
sun
has
less
than
fifty
of
your
years
ago
when
i
was
but
a
small
boy
such
a
projection
visited
my
father
it
offered
to
us
from
our
watery
planet
and
to
show
us
how
to
build
to
move
us
to
three
which
is
half
land
inhabited
by
lower
animals
and
he
did
accept
certainly
not
then
as
now
our
sole
lack
was
power
and
the
strangers
did
not
show
us
how
to
increase
our
supply
perhaps
they
had
more
power
than
we
perhaps
because
of
the
difficulty
of
communication
our
want
was
not
made
clear
to
them
but
of
course
we
did
not
want
to
move
to
three
and
we
had
already
had
for
hundreds
of
generations
we
have
never
been
able
to
reach
six
with
them
but
we
visited
three
long
ago
and
every
one
who
went
there
came
back
as
soon
as
he
could
we
detest
land
it
is
hard
barren
unfriendly
we
have
everything
here
upon
dasor
food
is
plentiful
synthetic
or
natural
as
we
prefer
our
watery
planet
supplies
our
every
need
and
wish
with
one
exception
and
now
that
we
are
assured
of
power
even
that
one
exception
vanishes
and
dasor
becomes
a
very
paradise
we
can
now
lead
our
natural
lives
work
and
play
to
our
fullest
capacity
we
would
not
trade
our
world
for
all
the
rest
of
the
universe
i
never
thought
of
it
in
that
way
but
you
right
at
that
seaton
conceded
you
are
ideally
suited
to
your
environment
but
how
do
i
get
to
planet
six
its
distance
is
terrific
even
as
cosmic
distances
go
you
wo
have
any
night
until
dasor
swings
outside
the
orbit
of
your
sun
and
until
then
six
will
be
invisible
even
to
our
most
powerful
telescope
i
do
not
know
myself
answered
carfon
but
i
will
send
out
a
call
for
the
chief
astronomer
he
will
meet
us
and
give
you
a
chart
and
the
exact
course
at
the
office
the
earthly
visitors
were
welcomed
formally
by
the
council
the
nine
men
in
control
of
the
entire
planet
the
ceremony
over
and
their
course
carefully
plotted
carfon
stood
at
the
door
of
the
a
moment
before
it
closed
we
thank
you
with
all
force
earthmen
for
what
you
have
done
for
us
this
day
please
remember
and
believe
that
this
is
no
idle
word
if
we
can
assist
you
in
any
way
in
this
conflict
which
is
to
come
the
resources
of
this
planet
are
at
your
disposal
we
join
osnome
and
the
other
planets
of
this
system
in
declaring
you
doctor
seaton
our
overlord
chapter
ix
the
welcome
to
norlamin
the
was
now
days
upon
her
way
toward
the
sixth
planet
seaton
gave
the
visiplates
and
the
instrument
board
his
customary
careful
scrutiny
and
rejoined
the
others
still
talking
about
the
human
fish
dottie
dimple
he
asked
as
he
stoked
his
villainous
pipe
peculiar
tribe
of
porpoises
but
i
strong
for
they
the
most
like
our
own
kind
of
folks
as
far
as
ideas
go
of
anybody
we
seen
yet
in
fact
they
more
like
us
than
a
lot
of
human
beings
we
all
know
i
like
them
immensely
you
could
like
any
other
way
their
size
terrible
dick
terrible
easy
as
i
am
i
ca
stand
for
any
such
joke
as
that
was
going
to
be
but
really
i
think
they
just
perfectly
fine
in
spite
of
their
being
so
carfon
is
just
simply
sweet
even
if
she
does
look
like
a
walrus
and
that
cute
little
seal
of
a
baby
was
just
too
perfectly
cunning
for
words
that
boy
seven
is
keen
as
mustard
too
he
should
be
put
in
crane
dryly
he
probably
has
as
much
intelligence
now
as
any
one
of
us
do
you
think
so
asked
margaret
he
acted
like
any
other
boy
but
he
did
seem
to
understand
things
remarkably
well
he
would
they
ahead
of
us
in
most
things
seaton
glanced
at
the
two
women
quizzically
and
turned
to
crane
and
as
for
their
being
bald
this
was
one
time
mart
when
those
two
phenomenal
heads
of
hair
our
two
little
are
so
proud
of
did
make
any
kind
of
hit
at
all
they
probably
regard
that
black
thatch
of
peg
and
dot
auburn
mop
as
relics
of
a
barbarous
and
prehistoric
age
about
as
we
would
regard
the
hirsute
hide
of
a
neanderthal
man
that
may
be
so
too
dorothy
replied
unconcernedly
but
we
planning
on
living
there
so
why
worry
about
it
i
like
them
anyway
and
i
believe
that
they
like
us
they
acted
that
way
but
say
mart
if
that
planet
is
so
old
that
all
their
land
area
has
been
eroded
away
how
come
they
got
so
much
water
left
and
they
got
quite
an
atmosphere
too
the
said
crane
while
greater
than
that
now
obtaining
upon
earth
was
probably
of
the
order
of
magnitude
of
three
meters
of
mercury
originally
as
to
the
erosion
they
might
have
had
more
water
to
begin
with
than
our
earth
had
yeah
that
account
for
it
all
right
said
dorothy
there
one
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
two
scientists
margaret
said
everywhere
we
gone
except
on
that
one
world
that
dick
thinks
is
a
wandering
planet
we
found
the
intelligent
life
quite
remarkably
like
human
beings
how
do
you
account
for
that
there
mart
is
one
for
the
massive
old
bean
to
concentrate
on
challenged
seaton
then
as
crane
considered
the
question
in
silence
for
some
time
he
went
on
i
answer
it
myself
then
by
asking
another
why
not
why
should
they
be
remember
man
is
the
highest
form
of
earthly
life
at
least
in
our
own
opinion
and
as
far
as
we
know
in
our
wanderings
we
have
picked
out
planets
quite
similar
to
our
own
in
point
of
atmosphere
and
temperature
and
within
narrow
limits
of
mass
as
well
it
stands
to
reason
that
under
such
similarity
of
conditions
there
would
be
a
certain
similarity
of
results
how
about
it
mart
reasonable
it
seems
plausible
in
a
way
conceded
crane
but
it
probably
is
not
universally
true
sure
not
could
be
hardly
no
doubt
we
could
find
a
lot
of
worlds
inhabited
by
all
kinds
of
intelligent
things
freaks
that
we
ca
even
begin
to
imagine
now
but
they
probably
would
be
occupying
planets
entirely
different
from
ours
in
some
essential
feature
of
atmosphere
temperature
or
mass
but
the
fenachrone
world
is
entirely
different
dorothy
argued
and
they
more
or
less
human
they
bipeds
anyway
with
recognizable
features
i
been
studying
that
record
with
you
you
know
and
their
world
has
so
much
more
mass
than
ours
that
their
gravitation
is
simply
frightful
that
much
difference
is
comparatively
slight
not
a
real
fundamental
difference
i
meant
a
hundred
or
so
times
either
way
greater
or
less
and
even
their
gravitation
has
modified
their
structure
a
lot
suppose
it
had
been
fifty
times
as
great
as
it
is
what
would
they
have
been
like
also
their
atmosphere
is
very
similar
to
ours
in
composition
and
their
temperature
is
bearable
it
is
my
opinion
that
atmosphere
and
temperature
have
more
to
do
with
evolution
than
anything
else
and
that
the
mass
of
the
planet
runs
a
poor
third
you
may
be
right
admitted
crane
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
arguing
from
insufficient
premises
sure
i
am
almost
no
premises
at
all
i
would
be
just
about
as
well
justified
in
deducing
the
structure
of
a
range
of
mountains
from
a
superficial
study
of
three
pebbles
picked
up
in
a
creek
near
them
however
we
can
get
an
idea
some
time
when
we
have
a
lot
of
time
how
remember
that
planet
we
struck
on
the
first
trip
that
had
an
atmosphere
composed
mostly
of
gaseous
chlorin
in
our
ignorance
we
assumed
that
life
there
was
impossible
and
did
stop
well
it
may
be
just
as
well
that
we
did
if
we
go
back
there
protected
as
we
are
with
our
rays
and
stuff
it
would
surprise
me
a
bit
to
find
life
there
and
lots
of
it
and
i
got
a
hunch
that
it
be
a
form
of
life
that
make
your
grandfather
whiskers
curl
right
up
into
a
ball
you
do
get
the
weirdest
ideas
dick
protested
dorothy
i
hope
you
are
planning
on
exploring
it
just
to
prove
your
point
never
thought
of
it
before
ca
do
it
now
anyway
got
our
hands
full
already
however
after
we
get
this
fenachrone
mess
cleaned
up
have
to
do
just
that
little
thing
wo
we
mart
as
that
intellectual
guy
said
while
he
was
insisting
upon
dematerializing
us
demands
it
by
all
means
we
should
be
in
a
position
to
make
contributions
to
science
in
fields
as
yet
untouched
most
assuredly
we
shall
investigate
those
points
then
they
go
alone
wo
they
peggy
absolutely
we
seen
some
pretty
middling
horrible
things
already
and
if
these
two
men
of
ours
call
the
frightful
things
we
have
seen
normal
and
are
planning
on
deliberately
hunting
up
things
that
even
they
will
consider
monstrous
you
and
i
most
certainly
shall
stay
at
home
yeah
you
say
it
easy
bounce
back
peg
you
struck
a
rubber
fence
rufus
you
little
fraud
you
know
you
would
let
me
go
to
the
corner
store
after
a
can
of
tobacco
without
insisting
on
tagging
along
you
a
began
dorothy
hotly
but
broke
off
in
amazement
and
gasped
for
heaven
sake
what
was
that
what
was
what
it
missed
me
it
went
right
through
you
it
was
a
kind
of
funny
little
cloud
like
smoke
or
something
it
came
right
through
the
ceiling
like
a
flash
went
right
through
you
and
on
down
through
the
floor
there
it
comes
back
again
before
their
staring
eyes
a
vague
nebulous
something
moved
rapidly
upward
through
the
floor
and
passed
upward
through
the
ceiling
dorothy
leaped
to
seaton
side
and
he
put
his
arm
around
her
reassuringly
right
folks
i
know
what
that
thing
is
well
shoot
it
quick
dorothy
implored
it
one
of
those
projections
from
where
we
heading
for
trying
to
get
our
range
and
it
the
most
welcome
sight
these
weary
old
eyes
have
rested
upon
for
full
many
a
long
and
dreary
moon
they
probably
located
us
from
our
rays
we
an
awful
long
ways
off
yet
though
and
going
like
a
streak
of
greased
lightning
so
they
having
trouble
in
holding
us
they
friendly
we
already
know
that
they
probably
want
to
talk
to
us
it
make
it
easier
for
them
if
we
shut
off
our
power
and
drift
at
constant
velocity
but
we
use
up
valuable
time
and
throw
our
calculations
all
out
of
whack
we
let
them
try
to
match
our
acceleration
if
they
can
do
that
they
good
the
apparition
reappeared
oscillating
back
and
forth
irregularly
passing
through
the
arenak
walls
through
the
furniture
and
the
instrument
boards
and
even
through
the
mighty
itself
as
though
nothing
was
there
eventually
however
it
remained
stationary
a
foot
or
so
above
the
floor
of
the
then
it
began
to
increase
in
density
until
apparently
a
man
stood
before
them
his
skin
like
that
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
planets
of
the
green
suns
was
green
he
was
tall
and
when
judged
by
earthly
standards
except
for
his
head
which
was
overly
large
and
which
was
particularly
massive
above
the
eyes
and
backward
from
the
ears
he
was
evidently
of
great
age
for
what
little
of
his
face
was
visible
was
seamed
and
wrinkled
and
his
long
thick
mane
of
hair
and
his
beard
were
a
dazzling
white
only
faintly
tinged
with
green
while
not
in
any
sense
transparent
nor
even
translucent
it
was
evident
that
the
apparition
before
them
was
not
composed
of
flesh
and
blood
he
looked
at
each
of
the
four
intensely
for
a
moment
then
pointed
toward
the
table
upon
which
stood
the
mechanical
educator
and
seaton
placed
it
in
front
of
the
peculiar
visitor
as
seaton
donned
a
headset
and
handed
one
to
the
stranger
the
latter
stared
at
him
impressing
upon
his
consciousness
that
he
was
to
be
given
a
knowledge
of
english
seaton
pressed
the
lever
receiving
as
he
did
so
a
sensation
of
an
unbroken
calm
a
serenity
profound
and
untroubled
and
the
projection
spoke
seaton
crane
and
ladies
welcome
to
norlamin
the
planet
toward
which
you
are
now
flying
we
have
been
awaiting
you
for
more
than
five
thousand
years
of
your
time
it
has
been
a
mathematical
certainty
it
has
been
graven
upon
the
very
sphere
itself
that
in
time
someone
would
come
to
us
from
without
this
system
bringing
a
portion
however
small
of
rovolon
of
the
metal
of
power
of
which
there
is
not
even
the
most
minute
trace
in
our
entire
solar
system
for
more
than
five
thousand
years
our
instruments
have
been
set
to
detect
the
vibrations
which
would
herald
the
advent
of
the
user
of
that
metal
now
you
have
come
and
i
perceive
that
you
have
vast
stores
of
it
being
yourselves
seekers
after
truth
you
will
share
it
with
us
gladly
as
we
will
instruct
you
in
many
things
you
wish
to
know
allow
me
to
operate
the
educator
i
would
gaze
into
your
minds
and
reveal
my
own
to
your
sight
but
first
i
must
tell
you
that
your
machine
is
too
rudimentary
to
work
at
all
well
and
with
your
permission
i
shall
make
certain
minor
alterations
seaton
nodded
permission
and
from
the
eyes
and
from
the
hands
of
the
figure
there
leaped
visible
streams
of
force
which
seized
the
transformers
coils
and
tubes
and
reformed
and
reconnected
them
under
seaton
bulging
eyes
into
an
entirely
different
mechanism
oh
i
see
he
gasped
say
what
are
you
anyway
pardon
me
in
my
eagerness
i
became
forgetful
i
am
orlon
the
first
of
astronomy
of
norlamin
in
my
observatory
upon
the
surface
of
the
planet
this
that
you
see
is
simply
my
projection
composed
of
forces
for
which
you
have
no
name
in
your
language
you
can
cut
it
off
if
you
wish
with
your
which
even
i
can
see
are
of
a
surprisingly
high
order
of
efficiency
there
this
educator
will
now
work
very
well
please
put
on
the
remodeled
headsets
all
four
of
you
they
did
so
and
the
rays
of
force
moved
levers
switches
and
dials
as
positively
as
human
hands
could
have
moved
them
and
with
infinitely
greater
speed
and
precision
as
the
dials
moved
each
brain
received
clearly
and
plainly
a
knowledge
of
the
customs
language
and
manners
of
the
inhabitants
of
norlamin
each
mind
became
suffused
with
a
vast
immeasurable
peace
calm
power
and
a
depth
and
breadth
of
mental
vision
theretofore
undreamed
of
looking
deep
into
his
mind
they
sensed
a
quiet
placid
certainty
beheld
power
and
knowledge
to
them
illimitable
perceived
depths
of
wisdom
to
them
unfathomable
then
from
his
mind
into
theirs
there
flowed
smoothly
a
mighty
stream
of
comprehension
of
cosmic
phenomena
they
hazily
saw
infinitely
small
units
grouped
into
planetary
formations
to
form
practically
dimensionless
particles
these
particles
in
turn
grouped
to
form
slightly
larger
ones
and
after
a
long
succession
of
such
grouping
they
knew
that
the
comparatively
gigantic
aggregates
which
then
held
their
attention
were
in
reality
electrons
and
protons
the
smallest
units
recognized
by
earthly
science
they
clearly
understood
the
combination
of
these
electrons
and
protons
into
atoms
they
perceived
plainly
the
way
in
which
atoms
build
up
molecules
and
comprehended
the
molecular
structure
of
matter
in
mathematical
thoughts
only
dimly
grasped
even
by
seaton
and
crane
were
laid
before
them
the
fundamental
laws
of
physics
of
electricity
of
gravitation
and
of
chemistry
they
saw
globular
aggregations
of
matter
the
suns
and
their
planets
comprising
solar
systems
saw
solar
systems
in
accordance
with
those
immutable
laws
grouped
into
galaxies
galaxies
in
turn
here
the
flow
was
suddenly
shut
off
as
though
a
valve
had
been
closed
and
the
astronomer
spoke
pardon
me
your
brains
should
be
stored
only
with
the
material
you
desire
most
and
can
use
to
the
best
advantage
for
your
mental
capacity
is
even
more
limited
than
my
own
please
understand
that
i
speak
in
no
derogatory
sense
it
is
only
that
your
race
has
many
thousands
of
generations
to
go
before
your
minds
should
be
stored
with
knowledge
indiscriminately
we
ourselves
have
not
yet
reached
that
stage
and
we
are
perhaps
millions
of
years
older
than
you
and
yet
he
continued
musingly
i
envy
you
knowledge
is
of
course
relative
and
i
can
know
little
time
and
space
have
yielded
not
an
iota
of
their
mystery
to
our
most
penetrant
minds
and
whether
we
delve
baffled
into
the
unknown
smallness
of
the
small
or
whether
we
peer
blind
and
helpless
into
the
unknown
largeness
of
the
large
it
is
the
same
infinity
is
comprehensible
only
to
the
infinite
one
the
force
directing
and
controlling
the
universe
and
the
unknowable
sphere
the
more
we
know
the
vaster
the
virgin
fields
of
investigation
open
to
us
and
the
more
infinitesimal
becomes
our
knowledge
but
i
am
perhaps
keeping
you
from
more
important
activities
as
you
approach
norlamin
more
nearly
i
shall
guide
you
to
my
observatory
i
am
glad
indeed
that
it
is
in
my
lifetime
that
you
have
come
to
us
and
i
await
anxiously
the
opportunity
of
greeting
you
in
the
flesh
the
years
remaining
to
me
of
this
cycle
of
existence
are
few
and
i
had
almost
ceased
hoping
to
witness
your
coming
the
projection
vanished
instantaneously
and
the
four
stared
at
each
other
in
an
incredulous
daze
of
astonishment
seaton
finally
broke
the
stunned
silence
well
i
be
kicked
to
death
by
little
red
spiders
he
ejaculated
mart
did
you
see
what
i
saw
or
did
i
get
tight
on
something
without
knowing
it
that
sure
burned
me
up
it
breaks
me
right
off
at
the
ankles
just
to
think
of
it
crane
walked
to
the
educator
in
silence
he
examined
it
felt
the
changed
coils
and
transformers
and
gently
shook
the
new
insulating
base
of
the
great
still
in
silence
he
turned
his
back
walked
around
the
instrument
board
read
the
meters
then
went
back
and
again
inspected
the
educator
it
was
real
and
not
a
higher
development
of
hypnotism
as
at
first
i
thought
it
must
be
he
reported
seriously
hypnotism
if
sufficiently
advanced
might
have
affected
us
in
that
fashion
even
to
teaching
us
all
a
strange
language
but
by
no
possibility
could
it
have
had
such
an
effect
upon
copper
steel
bakelite
and
glass
it
was
certainly
real
and
while
i
can
not
begin
to
understand
it
i
will
say
that
your
imagination
has
certainly
vindicated
itself
a
race
of
beings
who
can
do
such
things
as
that
can
do
almost
anything
you
have
been
right
from
the
start
then
you
can
beat
those
horrible
fenachrone
after
all
cried
dorothy
and
threw
herself
into
her
husband
arms
do
you
remember
dick
that
i
hailed
you
once
as
columbus
at
san
salvador
asked
margaret
unsteadily
from
crane
encircling
arm
what
could
a
man
be
called
who
from
the
sheer
depths
of
his
imagination
called
forth
the
means
of
saving
from
destruction
all
the
civilization
of
millions
of
entire
worlds
do
talk
that
way
please
folks
seaton
was
plainly
very
uncomfortable
he
blushed
intensely
the
burning
red
tide
rising
in
waves
up
to
his
hair
as
he
wriggled
in
embarrassment
like
any
schoolboy
mart
done
most
of
it
anyway
you
know
and
even
at
that
we
ai
out
of
the
woods
yet
by
rows
of
apple
trees
you
will
admit
will
you
not
that
we
can
see
our
way
out
of
the
woods
at
least
and
that
you
yourself
feel
rather
relieved
asked
crane
i
think
we
be
able
to
pull
their
corks
now
all
right
after
we
get
some
dope
it
a
cinch
they
either
got
the
stuff
we
need
or
know
how
to
get
it
and
if
that
zone
is
impenetrable
i
bet
they
be
able
to
dope
out
something
just
as
good
relieved
that
does
half
tell
it
guy
i
feel
as
if
i
had
just
pitched
off
the
old
man
of
the
sea
been
sitting
on
my
neck
what
say
you
girls
get
your
fiddle
and
guitar
and
we
sing
us
a
little
song
i
feel
kind
of
relieved
they
had
me
worried
some
it
the
first
time
i
felt
like
singing
since
we
cut
that
warship
up
dorothy
brought
out
her
fiddle
the
magnificent
stradivarius
formerly
crane
which
he
had
given
her
margaret
her
guitar
and
they
sang
one
rollicking
number
after
another
though
by
no
means
a
metropolitan
opera
quartette
their
voices
were
all
better
than
mediocre
and
they
had
sung
together
so
much
that
they
harmonized
readily
why
do
you
play
us
some
real
music
dottie
asked
margaret
after
a
time
you
have
practiced
for
ages
i
have
felt
like
playing
lately
but
i
do
now
and
dorothy
stood
up
and
swept
the
bow
over
the
strings
doctor
of
music
in
violin
an
accomplished
musician
playing
upon
one
of
the
finest
instruments
the
world
has
ever
known
she
was
lifted
out
of
herself
by
relief
from
the
dread
of
the
fenachrone
invasion
and
that
splendid
violin
expressed
every
subtle
nuance
of
her
thought
she
played
rhapsodies
and
paeans
and
solos
by
the
great
masters
she
played
vivacious
dances
then
traumerei
and
liebestraum
at
last
she
swept
into
the
immortal
meditation
and
as
the
last
note
died
away
seaton
held
out
his
arms
you
a
blinding
flash
and
a
deafening
report
dottie
dimple
and
i
love
you
he
declared
and
his
eyes
and
his
arms
spoke
volumes
that
his
light
utterance
had
left
unsaid
norlamin
close
enough
so
that
its
image
almost
filled
number
six
visiplate
the
four
wanderers
studied
it
with
interest
partially
obscured
by
clouds
and
with
its
polar
regions
two
glaring
caps
of
snow
they
would
be
green
in
a
few
months
when
the
planet
would
swing
inside
the
orbit
of
its
sun
around
the
vast
central
luminary
of
that
complex
solar
system
it
made
a
magnificent
picture
they
saw
sparkling
blue
oceans
and
huge
green
continents
of
unfamiliar
outlines
so
terrific
was
the
velocity
of
the
that
the
image
grew
larger
as
they
watched
it
and
soon
the
field
of
vision
could
not
contain
the
image
of
the
whole
disk
well
i
expect
orlon
be
showing
up
pretty
quick
now
remarked
seaton
and
it
was
not
long
until
the
projection
appeared
in
the
air
of
the
control
room
hail
terrestrials
he
greeted
them
with
your
permission
i
shall
direct
your
flight
permission
granted
the
figure
floated
across
the
room
to
the
board
and
the
rays
of
force
centered
the
visiplate
changed
the
direction
of
the
bar
a
trifle
decreased
slightly
their
negative
acceleration
and
directed
a
stream
of
force
upon
the
steering
mechanism
we
shall
alight
upon
the
grounds
of
my
observatory
upon
norlamin
in
seven
thousand
four
hundred
seconds
he
announced
presently
the
observatory
will
be
upon
the
dark
side
of
norlamin
when
we
arrive
but
i
have
a
force
operating
upon
the
steering
mechanism
which
will
guide
the
vessel
along
the
required
curved
path
i
shall
remain
with
you
until
we
land
and
we
may
converse
upon
any
topic
of
most
interest
to
you
we
got
a
topic
of
interest
all
right
that
what
we
came
out
here
for
but
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
you
about
it
i
show
you
he
brought
out
the
magnetic
brain
record
threaded
it
into
the
machine
and
handed
the
astronomer
a
orlon
put
it
on
touched
the
lever
and
for
an
hour
there
was
unbroken
silence
as
the
monstrous
brain
of
the
menace
was
studied
by
the
equally
capable
intellect
of
the
norlaminian
scientist
there
was
no
pause
in
the
motion
of
the
magnetic
tape
no
repetition
orlon
brain
absorbed
the
information
as
fast
as
it
could
be
sent
and
understood
that
frightful
mind
in
every
particular
as
the
end
of
the
tape
was
reached
and
the
awful
record
ended
a
shadow
passed
over
orlon
face
truly
a
depraved
evolution
it
is
sad
to
contemplate
such
a
perversion
of
a
really
excellent
brain
they
have
power
even
as
you
have
and
they
have
the
will
to
destroy
which
is
a
thing
that
i
can
not
understand
however
if
it
is
graven
upon
the
sphere
that
we
are
to
pass
it
means
only
that
upon
the
next
plane
we
shall
continue
our
searches
let
us
hope
with
better
tools
and
with
greater
understanding
than
we
now
possess
snapped
seaton
gravely
going
to
take
it
lying
down
without
putting
up
any
fight
at
all
what
can
we
do
violence
is
contrary
to
our
very
natures
no
man
of
norlamin
could
offer
any
but
passive
resistance
you
can
do
a
lot
if
you
will
put
on
that
headset
again
and
get
my
plan
offering
any
suggestions
your
far
abler
brain
may
suggest
as
the
human
scientist
poured
his
plan
of
battle
into
the
brain
of
the
astronomer
orlon
face
cleared
it
is
graven
upon
the
sphere
that
the
fenachrone
shall
pass
he
said
finally
what
you
ask
of
us
we
can
do
i
have
only
a
general
knowledge
of
rays
as
they
are
not
in
the
province
of
the
orlon
family
but
the
student
rovol
of
the
family
rovol
of
rays
has
all
present
knowledge
of
such
phenomena
tomorrow
i
will
bring
you
together
and
i
have
little
doubt
that
he
will
be
able
with
the
help
of
your
metal
of
power
to
solve
your
problem
i
do
quite
understand
what
you
said
about
a
whole
family
studying
one
subject
and
yet
having
only
one
student
in
it
said
dorothy
in
perplexity
a
little
explanation
is
perhaps
necessary
replied
orlon
first
you
must
know
that
every
man
of
norlamin
is
a
student
and
most
of
us
are
students
of
science
with
us
means
mental
effort
that
is
study
we
perform
no
physical
or
manual
labor
save
for
exercise
as
all
our
mechanical
work
is
done
by
forces
this
state
of
things
having
endured
for
many
thousands
of
years
it
long
ago
became
evident
that
specialization
was
necessary
in
order
to
avoid
duplication
of
effort
and
to
insure
complete
coverage
of
the
field
soon
afterward
it
was
discovered
that
very
little
progress
was
being
made
in
any
branch
because
so
much
was
known
that
it
took
practically
a
lifetime
to
review
that
which
had
already
been
accomplished
even
in
a
narrow
and
highly
specialized
field
many
points
were
studied
for
years
before
it
was
discovered
that
the
identical
work
had
been
done
before
and
either
forgotten
or
overlooked
to
remedy
this
condition
the
mechanical
educator
had
to
be
developed
once
it
was
perfected
a
new
system
was
begun
one
man
was
assigned
to
each
small
subdivision
of
scientific
endeavor
to
study
it
intensively
when
he
became
old
each
man
chose
a
successor
usually
a
son
and
transferred
his
own
knowledge
to
the
younger
student
he
also
made
a
complete
record
of
his
own
brain
in
much
the
same
way
as
you
have
recorded
the
brain
of
the
fenachrone
upon
your
metallic
tape
these
records
are
all
stored
in
a
great
central
library
as
permanent
references
all
these
things
being
true
now
a
young
person
may
need
only
finish
an
elementary
education
just
enough
to
learn
to
think
which
takes
only
about
or
thirty
years
and
then
he
is
ready
to
begin
actual
work
when
that
time
comes
he
receives
in
one
day
all
the
knowledge
of
his
specialty
which
has
been
accumulated
by
his
predecessors
during
many
thousands
of
years
of
intensive
study
whew
seaton
whistled
no
wonder
you
folks
know
something
with
that
start
i
believe
i
might
know
something
myself
as
an
astronomer
you
may
be
interested
in
this
and
stuff
or
do
you
know
all
about
that
already
no
the
fenachrone
are
far
ahead
of
us
in
that
subject
because
of
their
observatories
out
in
open
space
and
because
of
their
gigantic
reflectors
which
can
not
be
used
through
any
atmosphere
we
are
further
hampered
in
having
darkness
for
only
a
few
hours
at
a
time
and
only
in
the
winter
when
our
planet
is
outside
the
orbit
of
our
sun
around
the
great
central
sun
of
our
entire
system
however
with
the
rovolon
you
have
brought
us
we
shall
have
real
observatories
far
out
in
space
and
for
that
i
personally
will
be
indebted
to
you
more
than
i
can
ever
express
as
for
the
chart
i
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
examining
it
while
you
are
conferring
with
rovol
of
rays
how
many
families
are
working
on
rays
just
one
one
upon
each
kind
of
ray
that
is
each
of
the
ray
families
knows
a
great
deal
about
all
kinds
of
vibrations
of
the
ether
but
is
specializing
upon
one
narrow
field
take
for
instance
the
rays
you
are
most
interested
in
those
able
to
penetrate
a
zone
of
force
from
my
own
very
slight
and
general
knowledge
i
know
that
it
would
of
necessity
be
a
ray
of
the
fifth
order
these
rays
are
very
new
they
have
been
under
investigation
only
a
few
hundred
years
and
the
rovol
is
the
only
student
who
would
be
at
all
well
informed
upon
them
shall
i
explain
the
orders
of
rays
more
fully
than
i
did
by
means
of
the
educator
please
you
assumed
that
we
knew
more
than
we
do
so
a
little
explanation
would
help
all
ordinary
vibrations
that
is
all
molecular
and
material
ones
such
as
light
heat
electricity
radio
and
the
like
were
arbitrarily
called
waves
of
the
first
order
in
order
to
distinguish
them
from
waves
of
the
second
order
which
are
given
off
by
particles
of
the
second
order
which
you
know
as
protons
and
electrons
in
their
combination
to
form
atoms
your
scientist
millikan
discovered
these
rays
for
you
and
in
your
language
they
are
known
as
millikan
or
cosmic
rays
some
time
later
when
were
identified
the
rays
given
off
by
their
combination
into
electrons
or
by
the
disruption
of
electrons
were
called
rays
of
the
third
order
these
rays
are
most
interesting
and
most
useful
in
fact
they
do
all
our
mechanical
work
they
as
a
class
are
called
protelectricity
and
bear
the
same
relation
to
ordinary
electricity
that
electricity
does
to
torque
both
are
pure
energy
and
they
are
unlike
electricity
however
it
may
be
converted
into
many
different
forms
by
fields
of
force
in
a
way
comparable
to
that
in
which
white
light
is
resolved
into
colors
by
a
prism
or
rather
more
like
the
way
alternating
current
is
changed
to
direct
current
by
a
set
with
attendant
changes
in
properties
there
is
a
complete
spectrum
of
more
than
five
hundred
factors
each
as
different
from
the
others
as
red
is
different
from
green
continuing
farther
particles
of
the
fourth
order
give
rays
of
the
fourth
order
those
of
the
fifth
rays
of
the
fifth
order
rays
have
been
investigated
quite
thoroughly
but
only
mathematically
and
theoretically
as
they
are
of
excessively
short
and
are
capable
of
being
generated
only
by
the
breaking
down
of
matter
itself
into
the
corresponding
particles
however
it
has
been
shown
that
they
are
quite
similar
to
protelectricity
in
their
general
behavior
thus
the
power
that
propels
your
your
attractors
your
repellers
your
your
zone
of
force
all
these
things
are
simply
a
few
of
the
many
hundreds
of
of
the
fourth
order
all
of
which
you
doubtless
would
have
worked
out
for
yourselves
in
time
very
little
is
known
even
in
theory
of
the
rays
of
the
fifth
order
although
they
have
been
shown
to
exist
for
a
man
having
no
knowledge
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
rays
how
about
the
fifth
order
is
that
as
far
as
they
go
my
knowledge
is
slight
and
very
general
only
such
as
i
must
have
in
order
to
understand
my
own
subject
the
fifth
order
certainly
is
not
the
end
it
is
probably
scarcely
a
beginning
we
think
now
that
the
orders
extend
to
infinite
smallness
just
as
the
galaxies
are
grouped
into
larger
aggregations
which
are
probably
in
their
turn
only
tiny
units
in
a
scheme
infinitely
large
over
six
thousand
years
ago
the
last
third
order
rays
were
worked
out
and
certain
peculiarities
in
their
behavior
led
the
then
rovol
to
suspect
the
existence
of
the
fourth
order
successive
generations
of
the
rovol
proved
their
existence
determined
the
conditions
of
their
liberation
and
found
that
this
metal
of
power
was
the
only
catalyst
able
to
decompose
matter
and
thus
liberate
the
rays
this
metal
which
was
called
rovolon
after
the
rovol
was
first
described
upon
theoretical
grounds
and
later
was
found
by
spectroscopy
in
certain
stars
notably
in
one
star
only
eight
away
but
not
even
the
most
infinitesimal
trace
of
it
exists
in
our
entire
solar
system
since
these
discoveries
the
many
rovol
have
been
perfecting
the
theory
of
the
fourth
order
beginning
that
of
the
fifth
and
waiting
for
your
coming
the
present
rovol
like
myself
and
many
others
whose
work
is
almost
at
a
standstill
is
waiting
with
interest
to
greet
you
as
soon
as
the
can
be
landed
upon
our
planet
neither
your
nor
your
projections
could
get
you
any
rovolon
no
every
hundred
years
or
so
someone
develops
a
new
type
of
rocket
that
he
thinks
may
stand
a
slight
chance
of
making
the
journey
but
not
one
of
these
venturesome
youths
has
as
yet
returned
either
that
sun
has
no
planets
or
else
the
have
failed
our
projections
are
useless
as
they
can
be
driven
only
a
very
short
distance
upon
our
present
carrier
wave
with
a
carrier
of
the
fifth
order
we
could
drive
a
projection
to
any
point
in
the
galaxy
since
its
velocity
would
be
millions
of
times
that
of
light
and
the
power
necessary
reduced
accordingly
but
as
i
have
said
before
such
waves
can
not
be
generated
without
metal
rovolon
i
hate
to
break
this
up
i
like
to
listen
to
you
talk
for
a
week
but
we
going
to
land
pretty
quick
and
it
looks
as
though
we
were
going
to
land
pretty
hard
we
will
land
soon
but
not
hard
replied
orlon
confidently
and
the
landing
was
as
he
had
foretold
the
was
falling
with
an
velocity
but
so
fast
was
the
descent
that
it
seemed
to
the
watchers
as
though
they
must
crash
through
the
roof
of
the
huge
brilliantly
lighted
building
upon
which
they
were
dropping
and
bury
themselves
many
feet
in
the
ground
beneath
it
but
they
did
not
strike
the
observatory
so
incredibly
accurate
were
the
calculations
of
the
norlaminian
astronomer
and
so
inhumanly
precise
were
the
controls
he
had
set
upon
their
bar
that
as
they
touched
the
ground
after
barely
clearing
the
domed
roof
and
he
shut
off
their
power
the
passengers
felt
only
a
sudden
decrease
in
acceleration
like
that
following
the
coming
to
rest
of
a
rapidly
moving
elevator
after
it
has
completed
a
downward
journey
i
shall
join
you
in
person
very
shortly
orlon
said
and
the
projection
vanished
well
we
here
folks
on
another
new
world
not
quite
as
thrilling
as
the
first
one
was
is
it
and
seaton
stepped
toward
the
door
how
about
the
air
composition
density
gravity
temperature
and
so
on
asked
crane
perhaps
we
should
make
a
few
tests
did
you
get
that
on
the
educator
thought
you
did
gravity
a
little
less
than
air
composition
same
as
osnome
and
dasor
pressure
between
earth
and
osnome
temperature
like
osnome
most
of
the
time
but
fairly
comfortable
in
the
winter
snow
now
at
the
poles
but
this
observatory
is
only
ten
degrees
from
the
equator
they
do
wear
clothes
enough
to
flag
a
with
here
either
except
when
they
have
to
let
go
he
opened
the
door
and
the
four
travelers
stepped
out
upon
a
lawn
a
turf
whose
softness
would
shame
an
oriental
rug
the
landscape
was
illuminated
by
a
soft
and
mellow
yet
intense
green
light
which
emanated
from
no
visible
source
as
they
paused
and
glanced
about
them
they
saw
that
the
had
alighted
in
the
exact
center
of
a
circular
enclosure
a
hundred
yards
in
diameter
walled
by
row
upon
row
of
shrubbery
statuary
and
fountains
all
bathed
in
billows
of
light
at
only
one
point
was
the
circle
broken
there
the
walls
did
not
come
together
but
continued
on
to
border
a
lane
leading
up
to
the
massive
structure
of
marble
topped
by
its
enormous
glassy
dome
the
observatory
of
orlon
welcome
to
norlamin
terrestrials
the
deep
calm
voice
of
the
astronomer
greeted
them
and
orlon
in
the
flesh
shook
hands
cordially
in
the
american
fashion
with
each
of
them
in
turn
and
placed
around
each
neck
a
crystal
chain
from
which
depended
a
small
norlaminian
behind
him
there
stood
four
other
old
men
these
men
are
already
acquainted
with
each
of
you
but
you
do
not
as
yet
know
them
i
present
fodan
chief
of
the
five
of
norlamin
rovol
about
whom
you
know
astron
the
first
of
energy
satrazon
the
first
of
chemistry
orlon
fell
in
beside
seaton
and
the
party
turned
toward
the
observatory
as
they
walked
along
the
stared
held
by
the
unearthly
beauty
of
the
grounds
the
hedge
of
shrubbery
from
ten
to
twenty
feet
high
and
which
shut
out
all
sight
of
everything
outside
it
was
one
mass
of
vivid
green
and
flaring
crimson
leaves
each
leaf
and
twig
groomed
meticulously
into
its
precise
place
in
a
fantastic
geometrical
scheme
just
inside
this
boundary
there
stood
a
ring
of
statues
of
heroic
size
some
of
them
were
single
figures
of
men
and
women
some
were
busts
some
were
groups
in
natural
or
allegorical
poses
all
were
done
with
consummate
skill
and
feeling
between
the
statues
there
were
fountains
magnificent
bronze
and
glass
groups
of
the
strange
aquatic
denizens
of
this
strange
planet
bathed
in
geometrically
shaped
sprays
screens
and
columns
of
water
winding
around
between
the
statues
and
the
fountains
there
was
a
moving
scintillating
wall
and
upon
the
waters
and
upon
the
wall
there
played
torrents
of
color
cataracts
of
harmoniously
blended
light
reds
blues
yellows
greens
every
color
of
their
peculiar
green
spectrum
and
every
conceivable
combination
of
those
colors
writhed
and
flamed
in
ineffable
splendor
upon
those
deep
and
living
screens
of
falling
water
and
upon
that
shimmering
wall
as
they
entered
the
lane
seaton
saw
with
amazement
that
what
he
had
supposed
a
wall
now
close
at
hand
was
not
a
wall
at
all
it
was
composed
of
myriads
of
individual
sparkling
jewels
of
every
known
color
for
the
most
part
and
each
gem
apparently
entirely
unsupported
was
dashing
in
and
out
and
along
among
its
fellows
weaving
and
darting
here
and
there
flying
at
headlong
speed
along
an
extremely
tortuous
but
evidently
carefully
calculated
course
what
can
that
be
anyway
dick
whispered
dorothy
and
seaton
turned
to
his
guide
pardon
my
curiosity
orlon
but
would
you
mind
explaining
the
why
of
that
moving
wall
we
do
get
it
not
at
all
this
garden
has
been
the
private
retreat
of
the
family
of
orlon
for
many
thousands
of
years
and
women
of
our
house
have
been
beautifying
it
since
its
inception
you
may
have
observed
that
the
statuary
is
very
old
no
such
work
has
been
done
for
ages
modern
art
has
developed
along
the
lines
of
color
and
motion
hence
the
lighting
effects
and
the
tapestry
wall
each
gem
is
held
upon
the
end
of
a
minute
pencil
of
force
and
all
the
pencils
are
controlled
by
a
machine
which
has
a
key
for
every
jewel
in
the
wall
crane
the
methodical
stared
at
the
innumerable
flashing
jewels
and
asked
it
must
have
taken
a
prodigious
amount
of
time
to
complete
such
an
undertaking
it
is
far
from
complete
in
fact
it
is
scarcely
begun
it
was
started
only
about
four
hundred
years
ago
hundred
years
exclaimed
dorothy
do
you
live
that
long
how
long
will
it
take
to
finish
it
and
what
will
it
be
like
when
it
is
done
no
none
of
us
live
longer
than
about
one
hundred
and
sixty
years
at
about
that
age
most
of
us
decide
to
pass
when
this
tapestry
wall
is
finished
it
will
not
be
simply
form
and
color
as
it
is
now
it
will
be
a
portrayal
of
the
history
of
norlamin
from
the
first
cooling
of
the
planet
it
will
in
all
probability
require
thousands
of
years
for
its
completion
you
see
time
is
of
little
importance
to
us
and
workmanship
is
everything
my
companion
will
continue
working
upon
it
until
we
decide
to
pass
my
son
companion
may
continue
it
in
any
event
many
generations
of
the
women
of
the
orlon
will
work
upon
it
until
it
is
complete
when
it
is
done
it
will
be
a
thing
of
beauty
as
long
as
norlamin
shall
endure
but
suppose
that
your
son
wife
is
that
kind
of
an
artist
suppose
she
should
want
to
do
music
or
painting
or
something
else
asked
dorothy
curiously
that
is
quite
possible
for
fortunately
our
art
is
not
yet
entirely
intellectual
as
is
our
music
there
are
many
unfinished
artistic
projects
in
the
house
of
orlon
and
if
the
companion
of
my
son
should
not
find
one
to
her
liking
she
will
be
at
liberty
to
continue
anything
else
she
may
have
begun
or
to
start
an
entirely
new
project
of
her
own
you
have
a
family
then
asked
margaret
i
afraid
i
understand
things
very
well
when
you
gave
them
to
us
over
the
educator
i
sent
things
too
fast
for
you
not
knowing
that
your
educator
was
new
to
you
a
thing
with
which
you
were
not
thoroughly
familiar
i
will
therefore
explain
some
things
in
language
since
you
are
not
familiar
with
the
mechanism
of
thought
transference
the
five
a
body
do
what
governing
is
necessary
for
the
entire
planet
their
decrees
are
founded
upon
truth
and
are
therefore
the
law
population
is
regulated
according
to
the
needs
of
the
planet
and
since
much
work
is
now
in
progress
an
increase
in
population
was
recommended
by
the
five
my
companion
and
i
therefore
had
three
children
instead
of
the
customary
two
by
lot
it
fell
to
us
to
have
two
boys
and
one
girl
one
of
the
boys
will
assume
my
duties
when
i
pass
the
other
will
take
over
a
part
of
some
branch
of
science
that
has
grown
too
complex
for
one
man
to
handle
as
a
specialist
should
in
fact
he
has
already
chosen
his
specialty
and
been
accepted
for
it
he
is
to
be
the
nine
hundred
and
of
chemistry
the
student
of
the
asymmetric
carbon
atom
which
will
thus
be
his
specialty
from
this
time
henceforth
it
was
learned
long
ago
that
the
most
perfect
children
were
born
of
parents
in
the
full
prime
of
mental
life
that
is
at
one
hundred
years
of
age
therefore
with
us
each
generation
covers
one
hundred
years
the
first
years
of
a
child
life
are
spent
at
home
with
his
parents
during
which
time
he
acquires
his
elementary
education
in
the
common
schools
then
boys
and
girls
alike
move
to
the
country
of
youth
where
they
spend
another
years
there
they
develop
their
brains
and
initiative
by
conducting
any
researches
they
choose
most
of
us
at
that
age
solve
all
the
riddles
of
the
universe
only
to
discover
later
that
our
solutions
have
been
fallacious
however
much
really
excellent
work
is
done
in
the
country
of
youth
primarily
because
of
the
new
and
unprejudiced
viewpoints
of
the
virgin
minds
there
at
work
in
that
country
also
each
finds
his
life
companion
the
one
necessary
to
round
out
mere
existence
into
a
perfection
of
living
that
no
person
man
or
woman
can
ever
know
alone
i
need
not
speak
to
you
of
the
wonders
of
love
or
of
the
completion
and
fullness
of
life
that
it
brings
for
all
four
of
you
children
though
you
are
know
love
in
full
measure
at
fifty
years
of
age
the
man
now
mentally
mature
is
recalled
to
his
family
home
as
his
father
brain
is
now
losing
some
of
its
vigor
and
keenness
the
father
then
turns
over
his
work
to
the
son
by
means
of
the
educator
and
when
the
weight
of
the
accumulated
knowledge
of
a
hundred
thousand
generations
of
research
is
impressed
upon
the
son
brain
his
play
is
over
what
does
the
father
do
then
having
made
his
brain
record
about
which
i
have
told
you
he
and
his
companion
for
she
has
in
similar
fashion
turned
over
her
work
to
her
successor
retire
to
the
country
of
age
where
they
rest
and
relax
after
their
century
of
effort
they
do
whatever
they
care
to
do
for
as
long
as
they
please
to
do
it
finally
after
assuring
themselves
that
all
is
well
with
the
children
they
decide
that
they
are
ready
for
the
change
then
side
by
side
as
they
have
labored
they
pass
now
at
the
door
of
the
observatory
dorothy
paused
and
shrank
back
against
seaton
her
eyes
widening
as
she
stared
at
orlon
no
daughter
why
should
we
fear
the
change
he
answered
her
unspoken
question
calm
serenity
in
every
inflection
of
his
quiet
voice
the
is
unknowable
to
the
finite
mind
as
is
the
force
but
even
though
we
know
nothing
of
the
sublime
goal
toward
which
it
is
tending
any
person
ripe
for
the
change
can
and
of
course
does
liberate
the
so
that
its
progress
may
be
unimpeded
in
a
spacious
room
of
the
observatory
in
which
the
terrestrials
and
their
norlaminian
hosts
had
been
long
engaged
in
study
and
discussion
seaton
finally
rose
and
extended
a
hand
toward
his
wife
well
that
that
then
orlon
i
guess
we
been
thirty
hours
without
sleep
and
for
us
that
a
long
time
i
getting
so
dopey
i
ca
think
a
lick
we
better
go
back
to
the
and
turn
in
and
after
we
slept
nine
hours
or
so
i
go
over
to
laboratory
and
crane
come
back
here
to
you
you
need
not
return
to
your
vessel
said
orlon
i
know
that
its
somewhat
cramped
quarters
have
become
irksome
apartments
have
been
prepared
here
for
you
we
shall
have
a
meal
here
together
and
then
we
shall
retire
to
meet
again
tomorrow
as
he
spoke
a
tray
laden
with
appetizing
dishes
appeared
in
the
air
in
front
of
each
person
as
seaton
resumed
his
seat
the
tray
followed
him
remaining
always
in
the
most
convenient
position
crane
glanced
at
seaton
questioningly
and
satrazon
the
first
of
chemistry
answered
his
thought
before
he
could
voice
it
the
food
before
you
unlike
that
which
is
before
us
of
norlamin
is
wholesome
for
you
it
contains
no
copper
no
arsenic
no
heavy
metals
in
short
nothing
in
the
least
harmful
to
your
chemistry
it
is
balanced
as
to
carbohydrates
proteins
fats
and
sugars
and
contains
the
due
proportion
of
each
of
the
various
accessory
nutritional
factors
you
will
also
find
the
flavors
are
agreeable
to
each
of
you
synthetic
eh
you
got
us
analyzed
seaton
stated
rather
than
asked
as
with
knife
and
fork
he
attacked
the
thick
rare
and
beautifully
broiled
steak
which
with
its
mushrooms
and
other
delicate
trimmings
lay
upon
his
rigid
although
unsupported
tray
noticing
as
he
did
so
that
the
norlaminians
ate
with
tools
entirely
different
from
those
they
had
supplied
to
their
earthly
guests
entirely
synthetic
satrazon
made
answer
except
for
the
sodium
chloride
necessary
as
you
already
know
sodium
and
chlorin
are
very
rare
throughout
our
system
therefore
the
force
upon
the
took
from
your
vessel
the
amount
of
salt
required
for
the
formula
we
have
been
unable
to
synthesize
atoms
for
the
same
reason
that
the
labors
of
so
many
others
have
been
hindered
because
of
the
lack
of
rovolon
now
however
my
science
shall
progress
as
it
should
and
for
that
i
join
with
my
fellow
scientists
in
giving
you
thanks
for
the
service
you
have
rendered
us
we
thank
you
instead
replied
seaton
for
the
service
we
have
been
able
to
do
you
is
slight
indeed
compared
to
what
you
are
giving
us
in
return
but
it
seems
that
you
speak
quite
impersonally
of
the
force
upon
the
food
supply
did
you
yourself
direct
the
preparation
of
these
meats
and
vegetables
oh
no
i
merely
analyzed
your
tissues
surveyed
the
you
carried
discovered
your
individual
preferences
and
set
up
the
necessary
integrals
in
the
mechanism
the
forces
did
the
rest
and
will
continue
to
do
so
as
long
as
you
remain
upon
this
planet
fruit
salad
always
my
favorite
dish
dorothy
said
after
a
couple
of
bites
and
this
one
is
just
too
perfectly
divine
it
does
taste
like
any
other
fruit
i
ever
ate
either
i
think
it
must
be
the
same
ambrosia
that
the
old
pagan
gods
used
to
eat
if
all
you
did
was
to
set
up
the
integrals
how
do
you
know
what
you
are
going
to
have
for
the
next
meal
asked
crane
we
have
no
idea
what
the
form
flavor
or
consistency
of
any
dish
will
be
was
the
surprising
answer
we
know
only
that
the
flavor
will
be
agreeable
and
that
it
will
agree
with
the
form
and
consistency
of
the
substance
and
that
the
composition
will
be
chemically
you
see
all
the
details
of
flavor
form
texture
and
so
on
are
controlled
by
a
device
something
like
one
of
your
kaleidoscopes
the
integrals
render
impossible
any
unwholesome
unpleasant
or
unbalanced
combination
of
any
nature
and
everything
else
is
left
to
the
mechanism
which
operates
upon
pure
chance
some
system
i
rise
to
remark
and
seaton
with
the
others
resumed
his
vigorous
attack
upon
the
supper
the
meal
over
the
earthly
visitors
were
shown
to
their
rooms
and
fell
into
a
deep
dreamless
sleep
chapter
x
norlaminian
science
breakfast
over
seaton
watched
intently
as
his
tray
laden
with
empty
containers
floated
away
from
him
and
disappeared
into
an
opening
in
the
wall
how
do
you
do
it
orlon
he
asked
curiously
i
can
hardly
believe
it
even
after
seeing
it
done
each
tray
is
carried
upon
the
end
of
a
beam
or
rod
of
force
and
supported
rigidly
by
it
since
the
beam
is
tuned
to
the
individual
wave
of
the
instrument
you
wear
upon
your
chest
your
tray
is
of
course
placed
in
front
of
you
at
a
predetermined
distance
as
soon
as
the
sending
force
is
actuated
when
you
have
finished
your
meal
the
beam
is
shortened
thus
the
tray
is
drawn
back
to
the
food
laboratory
where
other
forces
cleanse
and
sterilize
the
various
utensils
and
place
them
in
readiness
for
the
next
meal
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
have
this
same
mechanism
place
your
meals
before
you
wherever
you
may
go
upon
this
planet
provided
only
that
a
clear
path
can
be
plotted
from
the
laboratory
to
your
person
thanks
but
it
would
pay
no
telling
where
we
be
besides
better
eat
in
the
most
of
the
time
to
keep
our
cook
well
i
see
rovol
got
his
boat
here
for
me
so
guess
better
turn
up
a
few
coming
along
dot
or
have
you
got
something
else
on
your
mind
i
going
to
leave
you
for
a
while
i
ca
really
understand
even
a
radio
and
just
thinking
about
those
funny
complicated
rays
and
things
you
are
going
after
makes
me
dizzy
in
the
head
orlon
is
going
to
take
us
over
to
the
country
of
youth
she
says
margaret
and
i
can
play
around
with
her
daughter
and
her
bunch
and
have
a
good
time
while
you
scientists
are
doing
your
stuff
all
right
till
tonight
and
seaton
stepped
out
into
the
grounds
where
the
first
of
rays
was
waiting
the
flier
was
a
craft
of
some
transparent
glassy
material
completely
enclosed
except
for
one
circular
opening
or
doorway
from
the
midsection
which
was
about
five
feet
in
diameter
and
provided
with
seats
capable
of
carrying
four
passengers
in
comfort
the
hull
tapered
down
smoothly
to
a
needle
point
at
each
end
as
seaton
entered
and
settled
himself
into
the
cushions
rovol
touched
a
lever
instantly
a
transparent
door
slid
across
the
opening
locking
itself
into
position
flush
with
the
surface
of
the
hull
and
the
flier
darted
into
the
air
and
away
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
silence
as
seaton
studied
the
terrain
beneath
them
fields
or
cities
there
were
none
the
land
was
covered
with
dense
forests
and
vast
meadows
with
here
and
there
great
buildings
surrounded
by
gracious
areas
rovol
finally
broke
the
silence
i
understand
your
problem
i
believe
since
orlon
has
transferred
to
me
all
the
thoughts
he
had
from
you
with
the
aid
of
the
rovolon
you
have
brought
us
i
am
confident
that
we
shall
be
able
to
work
out
a
satisfactory
solution
of
the
various
problems
involved
it
will
take
us
some
few
minutes
to
traverse
the
distance
to
my
laboratory
and
if
there
are
any
matters
upon
which
your
mind
is
not
quite
clear
i
shall
try
to
clarify
them
that
letting
me
down
easy
seaton
grinned
but
you
do
need
to
be
afraid
of
hurting
my
feelings
i
know
just
exactly
how
ignorant
and
dumb
i
am
compared
to
you
there
a
lot
of
things
i
do
get
at
all
first
and
nearest
this
airboat
it
has
no
at
all
i
assume
that
it
like
so
many
other
things
hereabouts
is
riding
on
the
end
of
a
rod
of
force
exactly
the
beam
is
generated
and
maintained
in
my
laboratory
all
that
is
here
in
the
flier
is
a
small
sender
for
remote
control
how
do
you
obtain
your
power
asked
seaton
solar
generators
and
tide
motors
i
know
that
all
your
work
is
done
by
protelectricity
but
orlon
did
not
inform
us
as
to
the
sources
we
have
not
used
such
inefficient
generators
for
many
thousands
of
years
long
ago
it
was
shown
by
research
that
these
rays
were
constantly
being
generated
in
abundance
in
outer
space
and
that
they
could
be
collected
upon
spherical
condensers
and
transmitted
without
loss
to
the
surface
of
the
planet
by
means
of
matched
and
synchronized
crystals
several
millions
of
these
condensers
have
been
built
and
thrown
out
to
become
tiny
satellites
of
norlamin
how
did
you
get
them
far
enough
out
the
first
ones
were
forced
out
to
the
required
distance
upon
beams
of
force
produced
by
the
conversion
of
electricity
which
was
in
turn
produced
from
turbines
solar
motors
and
tide
motors
with
a
few
of
them
out
however
it
was
easy
to
obtain
sufficient
power
to
send
out
more
and
now
whenever
one
of
us
requires
more
power
than
he
has
at
his
disposal
he
merely
sends
out
such
additional
collectors
as
he
needs
now
about
those
rays
which
will
penetrate
a
zone
of
force
i
am
told
that
they
are
not
ether
waves
at
all
they
are
not
ether
waves
the
fourth
order
rays
of
which
the
theory
has
been
completely
worked
out
are
the
shortest
vibrations
that
can
be
propagated
through
the
ether
for
the
ether
itself
is
not
a
continuous
medium
we
do
not
know
its
nature
exactly
but
it
is
an
actual
substance
and
is
composed
of
discrete
particles
of
the
fourth
order
now
the
zone
of
force
which
is
itself
a
phenomenon
sets
up
a
condition
of
stasis
in
the
particles
composing
the
ether
these
particles
are
relatively
so
coarse
that
rays
and
particles
of
the
fifth
order
will
pass
through
the
fixed
zone
without
retardation
therefore
if
there
is
anything
between
the
particles
of
the
ether
this
matter
is
being
debated
hotly
among
us
at
the
present
time
it
must
be
a
if
i
may
use
that
term
we
have
never
been
able
to
investigate
any
of
these
things
experimentally
not
even
such
a
coarse
aggregation
as
is
the
ether
but
now
having
rovolon
it
will
not
be
many
thousands
of
years
until
we
shall
have
extended
our
knowledge
many
orders
farther
in
both
directions
just
how
will
rovolon
help
you
it
will
enable
us
to
generate
a
force
of
the
ninth
magnitude
that
much
power
is
necessary
to
set
up
what
you
have
so
aptly
named
a
zone
of
force
and
will
give
us
a
source
of
fourth
fifth
and
probably
higher
orders
of
rays
which
if
they
are
generated
in
space
at
all
are
beyond
our
present
reach
the
zone
of
force
is
necessary
to
shield
certain
items
of
equipment
from
ether
vibrations
as
any
such
vibration
inside
the
controlling
fields
of
force
renders
observation
or
control
of
the
higher
orders
of
rays
impossible
hm
m
i
see
i
learning
something
seaton
replied
cordially
just
as
the
a
radio
set
is
the
more
perfect
must
be
its
shielding
yes
just
as
a
trace
of
any
gas
will
destroy
the
usefulness
of
your
most
sensitive
vacuum
tubes
and
just
as
imperfect
shielding
will
allow
interfering
waves
to
enter
sensitive
electrical
apparatus
in
that
same
fashion
will
even
the
slightest
ether
vibration
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
extremely
sensitive
fields
and
lenses
of
force
which
must
be
used
in
controlling
forces
of
the
higher
orders
you
have
tested
the
theory
of
the
fourth
order
yet
have
you
no
but
that
is
unnecessary
the
theory
of
the
fourth
order
is
not
really
theory
at
all
it
is
mathematical
fact
although
we
have
never
been
able
to
generate
them
we
know
exactly
the
forces
you
use
in
your
ship
of
space
and
we
can
tell
you
of
some
thousands
of
others
more
or
less
similar
and
also
highly
useful
forces
which
you
have
not
yet
discovered
but
are
allowing
to
go
to
waste
we
know
exactly
what
they
are
how
to
liberate
and
control
them
and
how
to
use
them
in
fact
in
the
work
which
we
are
to
begin
today
we
shall
use
but
little
ordinary
power
almost
all
our
work
will
be
done
by
forces
liberated
from
copper
by
means
of
the
rovolon
you
have
given
me
but
here
we
are
at
my
laboratory
you
already
know
that
the
best
way
to
learn
is
by
doing
and
we
shall
begin
at
once
the
flier
alighted
upon
a
lawn
quite
similar
to
the
one
before
the
observatory
of
orlon
and
the
scientist
led
his
earthly
guest
through
the
main
entrance
of
the
imposing
structure
of
marble
and
gleaming
metal
and
into
the
vast
room
that
was
his
laboratory
great
benches
lined
the
walls
and
there
were
hundreds
of
dials
meters
tubes
transformers
and
other
instruments
whose
uses
seaton
could
not
even
guess
rovol
first
donned
a
suit
of
transparent
flexible
material
of
a
deep
golden
color
instructing
seaton
to
do
the
same
explaining
that
much
of
the
work
would
be
with
dangerous
frequencies
and
with
high
pressures
and
that
the
suits
were
not
only
absolute
insulators
against
electricity
heat
and
sound
but
were
also
proof
against
any
harmful
radiations
as
each
helmet
was
equipped
with
radiophones
conversation
was
not
interfered
with
in
the
least
rovol
took
up
a
tiny
and
with
it
deftly
cut
off
a
bit
of
rovolon
almost
microscopic
in
size
this
he
placed
upon
a
great
block
of
burnished
copper
and
upon
it
played
a
force
as
he
manipulated
two
levers
two
more
beams
of
force
flattened
out
the
particle
of
metal
spread
it
out
over
the
copper
and
forced
it
into
the
surface
of
the
block
until
the
thin
coating
was
at
every
point
in
molecular
contact
with
the
copper
beneath
it
a
perfect
job
of
plating
and
one
done
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
he
then
cut
out
a
piece
of
the
treated
copper
the
size
of
a
pea
and
other
forces
rapidly
built
around
it
a
structure
of
coils
and
metallic
tubes
this
apparatus
he
suspended
in
the
air
at
the
extremity
of
a
small
beam
of
force
the
block
of
copper
was
next
cut
in
two
and
rovol
fingers
moved
rapidly
over
the
keys
of
a
machine
which
resembled
slightly
an
overgrown
and
exceedingly
complicated
machine
streams
and
pencils
of
force
flashed
and
crackled
and
seaton
saw
raw
materials
transformed
into
a
complete
in
its
center
the
lump
of
plated
copper
where
an
instant
before
there
had
been
only
empty
space
upon
the
massive
metal
bench
rovol
hands
moved
rapidly
from
keys
to
dials
and
back
and
suddenly
a
zone
of
force
as
large
as
a
basketball
appeared
around
the
apparatus
poised
in
the
air
but
it
fly
off
and
we
ca
stop
it
with
anything
seaton
protested
and
it
did
indeed
dart
rapidly
upward
the
old
man
shook
his
head
as
he
manipulated
still
more
controls
and
seaton
gasped
as
nine
stupendous
beams
of
force
hurled
themselves
upon
that
brilliant
spherical
mirror
of
pure
energy
seized
it
in
and
shaped
it
resistlessly
under
his
bulging
eyes
into
a
complex
geometrical
figure
of
precisely
the
desired
form
lurid
violet
light
filled
the
room
and
seaton
turned
towards
the
bar
that
mass
of
copper
was
shrinking
visibly
second
by
second
so
vast
were
the
forces
being
drawn
from
it
and
the
searing
blinding
light
would
have
been
intolerable
but
for
the
protective
of
his
helmet
tremendous
flashes
of
lightning
ripped
and
tore
from
the
of
the
bench
to
the
which
flared
at
temperature
under
the
incessant
impacts
knowing
that
this
was
but
an
infinitesimal
fraction
of
the
power
being
used
seaton
very
mind
staggered
as
he
strove
to
understand
the
magnitude
of
the
forces
at
work
upon
that
stubborn
sphere
of
energy
the
aged
scientist
used
no
tools
whatever
as
we
understand
the
term
his
laboratory
was
a
at
his
command
were
the
stupendous
forces
of
a
battery
of
planetoid
accumulators
and
added
to
these
were
the
forces
of
the
disintegrating
copper
bar
electricity
protelectricity
and
rays
under
millions
upon
millions
of
kilovolts
of
pressure
leaped
to
do
the
bidding
of
that
wonderful
brain
stored
with
the
accumulated
knowledge
of
countless
thousands
of
years
of
scientific
research
watching
the
ancient
physicist
work
seaton
compared
himself
to
a
schoolboy
mixing
chemicals
indiscriminately
and
ignorantly
with
no
knowledge
whatever
of
their
properties
occasionally
obtaining
a
reaction
by
pure
chance
whereas
he
had
worked
with
energy
schoolboy
fashion
the
master
craftsman
before
him
knew
every
reagent
every
reaction
and
worked
with
known
and
thoroughly
familiar
agencies
to
bring
about
his
exactly
predetermined
ends
just
as
calmly
certain
of
the
results
as
seaton
himself
would
have
been
in
his
own
laboratory
mixing
equivalent
quantities
of
solutions
of
barium
chloride
and
of
sulphuric
acid
to
obtain
a
precipitate
of
barium

after

hour
after

rovol
labored
on
oblivious
to
the
passage
of

in
his
zeal
of

the
while
carefully
instructing
seaton
who
watched
every

with
intense
interest
and
did
everything
possible
for
him
to
do
bit
by
bit
a
towering
structure
arose
in
the
middle
of
the
laboratory
a
metal
foundation
supported
a
massive
compound
bearing
which
in
turn
carried
a
tubular
network
of
latticed
metal
mounted
like
an
immense
telescope
near
the
upper
outer
end
of
this
openwork
tube
a
group
of
nine
forces
held
the
field
of
force
rigidly
in
place
in
its
axis
at
the
lower
extremity
were
mounted
seats
for
two
operators
and
the
control
panels
necessary
for
the
operation
of
the
intricate
system
of
forces
and
motors
which
would
actuate
and
control
that
gigantic
projector
immense

seats
circles
fully
forty
feet
in

graduated
with
incredible
delicacy
and
accuracy
into
decimal

of

and
each
driven
by
motors
through
and
connections
having
no
backlash
whatever
while
rovol
was
working
upon
one
of
the
last
instruments
to
be
installed
upon
the
controlling
panel
a
mellow
note
sounded
throughout
the
building
and
he
immediately
ceased
his
labors
and
opened
the
of
his
power
plants
you
have
done
well
youngster
he
congratulated
his
helper
as
he
began
to
take
off
his
protective
covering
without
your
aid
i
could
not
have
accomplished
nearly
this
much
during
one
period
of
labor
the
periods
of
exercise
and
of
relaxation
are
at
hand
let
us
return
to
the
house
of
orlon
where
we
all
shall
gather
to
relax
and
to
refresh
ourselves
for
the
labors
of
tomorrow
but
it
almost
done
protested
seaton
let
finish
it
up
and
shoot
a
little
juice
through
it
just
to
try
it
out
there
speaks
the
rashness
and
impatience
of
youth
rejoined
the
scientist
calmly
removing
the
younger
man
suit
and
leading
him
out
to
the
waiting
airboat
i
read
in
your
mind
that
you
are
often
guilty
of
laboring
continuously
until
your
brain
loses
its
keen
edge
learn
now
once
and
for
all
that
such
conduct
is
worse
than
foolish
it
is
criminal
we
have
labored
the
full
period
laboring
for
more
than
that
length
of
time
without
recuperation
results
in
a
loss
of
power
which
if
persisted
in
wreaks
permanent
injury
to
the
mind
and
by
it
you
gain
nothing
we
have
more
than
ample
time
to
do
that
which
must
be
done
the
projector
shall
be
completed
before
the
warning
torpedo
shall
have
reached
the
planet
of
the
fenachrone
therefore
is
unwarranted
as
for
testing
know
now
that
only
mechanisms
built
by
bunglers
require
testing
properly
built
machines
work
properly
but
i
have
liked
to
see
it
work
just
once
anyway
lamented
seaton
as
the
small
airship
tore
through
the
air
on
its
way
back
to
the
observatory
you
must
cultivate
calmness
my
son
and
the
art
of
relaxation
with
those
qualities
your
race
can
easily
double
its
present
span
of
useful
life
physical
exercise
to
maintain
the
bodily
tissues
at
their
best
and
mental
relaxation
following
mental
toil
these
things
are
the
secrets
of
a
long
and
productive
life
why
attempt
to
do
more
than
can
be
accomplished
efficiently
there
is
always
tomorrow
i
am
more
interested
in
that
which
we
are
now
building
than
you
can
possibly
be
since
many
generations
of
the
rovol
have
anticipated
its
construction
yet
i
realize
that
in
the
interest
of
our
welfare
and
for
the
progress
of
civilization
today
labors
must
not
be
prolonged
beyond
period
of
work
furthermore
you
yourself
realize
that
there
is
no
optimum
point
at
which
any
task
may
be
interrupted
short
of
final
completion
of
any
project
one
point
is
the
same
as
any
other
had
we
continued
we
would
have
wished
to
continue
still
farther
and
so
on
without
end
you
probably
right
at
that
the
impetuous
chemist
conceded
as
their
craft
came
to
earth
before
the
observatory
crane
and
orlon
were
already
in
the
common
room
as
were
the
scientists
seaton
already
knew
as
well
as
a
group
of
women
and
children
still
strangers
to
the
terrestrials
in
a
few
minutes
orlon
companion
a
dignified
woman
entered
accompanied
by

a
laughing
boisterous
group
of

from
the
country
of

introductions
over
seaton
turned
to
crane
how
every
little
thing
mart
very
well
indeed
we
are
building
an
observatory
in
space
or
rather
orlon
is
building
it
and
i
am
doing
what
little
i
can
to
help
him
in
a
few
days
we
shall
be
able
to
locate
the
system
of
the
fenachrone
how
is
your
work
progressing
smoother
than
a
kitten
ear
got
the

we
going
to
project
a
force
out
to
grab
us
some
dense

a
pretty
close
approach
to
pure
neutronium
nothing
dense
enough
around
here
even
in
the
core
of

we
going
out
to
a

major
get
some
material
of
the
proper
density
from
its
core
and
convert
our

into

then
we
can
really
get
busy
go
places
and
do
things

have
been
under

what
use
can
such
a
substance
be
to
you
ca
get
pure
neutronium
of
course
could
use
it
if
we
could
what
we
need
and
are
going
to
get
is
a
material
of
about
two
and
a
half
million
specific
gravity
got
to
have
it
for
lenses
and
controls
for
the
forces
those
rays
go
right
through
anything
less
dense
without
measurable
refraction
but
i
see
rovol
giving
me
a
nasty
look
he
my
boss
on
this
job
and
i
imagine
this
kind
of
talk
barred
during
the
period
of
relaxation
as
being
work
that
so
chief
you
know
that
it
is
barred
you
incorrigible
young
cub
answered
rovol
with
a
smile
all
right
boss
one
more
little
infraction
and
i
shut
up
like
a
clam
i
like
to
know
what
the
girls
have
been
doing
we
been
having
a
wonderful
time
dorothy
declared
we
been
designing
fabrics
and
ornaments
and
jewels
and
things
wait
you
see
fine
all
right
orlon
it
your
party
what
to
do
this
is
the
time
of
exercise
we
have
many
forms
most
of
which
are
unfamiliar
to
you
you
all
swim
however
and
as
that
is
one
of
the
best
of
exercises
i
suggest
that
we
all
swim
lead
us
to
it
seaton
exclaimed
then
his
voice
changed
abruptly
wait
a
minute
i
do
know
about
our
swimming
in
copper
sulphate
solution
we
swim
in
fresh
water
as
often
as
in
salt
and
the
pool
is
now
filled
with
distilled
water
the
terrestrials
quickly
donned
their
bathing
suits
and
all
went
through
the
observatory
and
down
a
winding
path
bordered
with
the
peculiarly
beautiful
scarlet
and
green
shrubbery
to
the
pool
an
artificial
lake
covering
a
hundred
acres
its
polished
metal
bottom
and
sides
strikingly
decorated
with
jewels
and
glittering
tiles
in
tasteful
yet
contrasting
inlaid
designs
any
desired
depth
of
water
was
available
and
plainly
marked
from
the
shallows
where
the
smallest
children
splashed
to
the
forty
feet
of
liquid
crystal
which
received
the
diver
who
cared
to
try
his
skill
from
one
of
the
many
flying
rings
and
catapults
which
rose
high
into
the
air
a
short
distance
away
from
the
entrance
orlon
and
the
others
of
the
older
generation
plunged
into
the
water
without
ado
and
struck
out
for
the
other
shore
using
a
fast
stroke
swimming
in
a
wide
circle
they
came
out
upon
the
apparatus
and
went
through
a
series
of
methodical
dives
and
gymnastic
performances
it
was
evident
that
they
swam
as
orlon
had
intimated
for
exercise
to
them
exercise
was
a
necessary
form
of
labor
labor
which
they
performed
thoroughly
and
well
but
nothing
to
call
forth
the
enthusiasm
they
displayed
in
their
chosen
fields
of
mental
effort
the
visitors
from
the
country
of
youth
however
locked
arms
and
sprang
to
surround
the
four
terrestrials
crying
let
do
a
group
dive
i
do
believe
that
i
can
swim
well
enough
to
enjoy
what
coming
whispered
margaret
to
crane
and
they
slipped
into
the
pool
and
turned
around
to
watch
seaton
and
dorothy
both
strong
swimmers
locked
arms
and
laughed
as
they
were
encircled
by
the
green
phalanx
and
swept
out
to
the
end
of
a
structure
and
upon
a
catapult
hold
tight
everybody
someone
yelled
and
interlaced
straining
arms
and
legs
held
the
green
and
white
bodies
in
one
motionless
group
as
a
gigantic
force
hurled
them
fifty
feet
into
the
air
and
out
over
the
deepest
part
of
the
pool
there
was
a
mighty
splash
and
a
miniature
tidal
wave
as
that
mass
of
humanity
struck
the
water
many
feet
they
went
down
before
the
cordon
was
broken
and
the
individual
units
came
to
the
surface
then
pandemonium
reigned
vigorous
informal
games
having
to
do
with
floating
and
sinking
balls
and
effigies
pushball
in
which
the
players
never
seemed
to
know
or
to
care
upon
which
side
they
were
playing
and
ducking
contests
a
green
mermaid
having
felt
the
incredible
power
of
seaton
arms
as
he
tossed
her
lightly
away
from
a
goal
he
was
temporarily
defending
put
both
her
small
hands
around
his
biceps
wonderingly
amazed
at
a
strength
unknown
and
impossible
upon
her
world
then
playfully
tried
to
push
him
under
failing
she
called
for
help
he
needed
a
good
ducking
for
ages
dorothy
cried
and
she
and
several
other
girls
threw
themselves
upon
him
over
and
around
him
the
lithe
forms
flashed
while
the
rest
of
the
young
people
splashed
water
impartially
over
all
the
combatants
and
cheered
them
on
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
the
signal
sounded
to
end
the
period
of
exercise
saved
by
the
bell
seaton
laughed
as
thoroughly
ducked
and
almost
half
drowned
he
was
allowed
to
swim
ashore
when
all
had
returned
to
the
common
room
of
the
observatory
and
had
seated
themselves
orlon
took
out
his
miniature
no
larger
than
a
fountain
pen
and
flashed
it
briefly
upon
one
of
the
hundreds
of
lenses
upon
the
wall
instantly
each
chair
converted
itself
into
a
divan
inviting
complete
repose
i
believe
that
you
of
earth
would
perhaps
enjoy
some
of
our
music
during
this
the
period
of
relaxation
and
repose
it
is
so
different
from
your
own
orlon
remarked
as
he
again
manipulated
his
tiny
every
light
was
extinguished
and
there
was
felt
a
profoundly
deep
vibration
a
note
so
low
as
to
be
palpable
rather
than
audible
and
simultaneously
the
utter
darkness
was
relieved
by
a
tinge
of
red
so
dark
as
to
be
barely
perceptible
while
a
peculiar
somber
fragrance
pervaded
the
atmosphere
the
music
rapidly
ran
the
gamut
to
the
limit
of
audibility
and
in
the
same
tempo
the
lights
traversed
the
visible
spectrum
and
disappeared
then
came
a
crashing
chord
and
a
vivid
flare
of
blended
light
ushering
in
an
indescribable
symphony
of
sound
and
color
accompanied
by
a
slower
succession
of
shifting
blending
odors
the
quality
of
tone
was
now
that
of
a
gigantic
orchestra
now
that
of
a
full
brass
band
now
that
of
a
single
unknown
instrument
as
though
the
composer
had
had
at
his
command
every
overtone
capable
of
being
produced
by
any
possible
instrument
and
with
them
had
woven
a
veritable
tapestry
of
melody
upon
an
incredibly
complex
loom
of
sound
as
went
the
harmony
so
the
play
of
light
accompanied
it
neither
music
nor
illumination
came
from
any
apparent
source
they
simply
pervaded
the
entire
room
when
the
music
was
fast
and
certain
passages
were
of
a
rapidity
impossible
for
any
human
fingers
to
attain
the
lights
flashed
in
vivid
tiny
pencils
intersecting
each
other
in
sharply
drawn
brilliant
figures
which
changed
with
dizzying
speed
when
the
tempo
was
slow
the
beams
were
soft
and
broad
blending
into
each
other
to
form
sinuous
indefinite
writhing
patterns
whose
very
vagueness
was
infinitely
soothing
what
do
you
think
of
it
mrs
seaton
orlon
asked
marvelous
breathed
dorothy
awed
i
never
imagined
anything
like
it
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
how
much
i
like
it
i
never
dreamed
of
such
absolute
perfection
of
execution
and
the
way
the
lighting
accompanies
the
theme
is
just
too
perfectly
wonderful
for
words
it
was
incredibly
brilliant
brilliant
yes
perfectly
executed
yes
but
i
notice
that
you
say
nothing
of
depth
of
feeling
or
of
emotional
appeal
dorothy
blushed
uncomfortably
and
started
to
say
something
but
orlon
silenced
her
and
continued
you
need
not
apologize
i
had
a
reason
for
speaking
as
i
did
for
in
you
i
recognize
a
real
musician
and
our
music
is
indeed
entirely
soulless
that
is
the
result
of
our
ancient
civilization
we
are
so
old
that
our
music
is
purely
intellectual
entirely
mechanical
instead
of
emotional
it
is
perfect
but
like
most
of
our
other
arts
it
is
almost
completely
without
feeling
but
your
statues
are
wonderful
as
i
told
you
those
statues
were
made
myriads
of
years
ago
at
that
time
we
also
had
real
music
but
unlike
statuary
music
at
that
time
could
not
be
preserved
for
posterity
that
is
another
thing
you
have
given
us
attend
at
one
end
of
the
room
as
upon
a
screen
the
four
terrestrials
saw
themselves
seated
in
the
of
the
they
saw
and
heard
margaret
take
up
her
guitar
and
strike
four
sonorous
chords
in
a
then
as
if
they
had
been
there
in
person
they
heard
themselves
sing
the
and
all
the
other
songs
they
had
sung
far
off
in
space
they
heard
margaret
suggest
that
dorothy
play
some
real
music
and
heard
seaton
comments
upon
the
quartette
in
that
youngster
you
were
entirely
wrong
said
orlon
stopping
the
reproduction
for
a
moment
the
entire
planet
was
listening
to
you
very
attentively
we
were
enjoying
it
as
no
music
has
been
enjoyed
for
thousands
of
years
the
whole
planet
gasped
margaret
were
you
broadcasting
it
how
could
you
easy
grinned
seaton
they
can
do
most
anything
with
these
rays
of
theirs
when
you
have
time
in
some
period
of
labor
we
would
appreciate
it
very
much
if
you
four
would
sing
for
us
again
would
give
us
more
of
your
vast
store
of
youthful
music
for
we
can
now
preserve
it
exactly
as
it
is
sung
but
much
as
we
enjoyed
the
quartette
seaton
it
was
your
work
upon
the
violin
that
took
us
by
storm
beginning
with
tomorrow
my
companion
intends
to
have
you
spend
as
many
periods
as
you
will
playing
for
our
records
we
shall
now
have
your
music
if
you
like
it
so
well
would
you
rather
i
play
you
something
i
had
played
before
that
is
labor
we
could
not
piffle
dorothy
interrupted
do
you
see
that
i
could
really
play
right
now
with
somebody
to
listen
who
really
enjoys
music
whereas
if
i
tried
to
play
in
front
of
a
record
i
be
perfectly
mechanical
dot
i
get
your
fiddle
keep
your
seat
son
instructed
orlon
as
the
case
containing
the
stradivarius
appeared
before
dorothy
borne
by
a
pencil
of
force
while
that
temperament
is
incomprehensible
to
every
one
of
us
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
the
artistic
mind
does
work
in
that
manner
we
listen
dorothy
swept
into
the
melody
in
f
and
as
the
poignantly
beautiful
strains
poured
forth
from
that
wonderful
violin
she
knew
that
she
had
her
audience
with
her
though
so
intellectual
that
they
themselves
were
incapable
of
producing
music
of
real
depth
of
feeling
they
could
understand
and
could
enjoy
such
music
with
an
appreciation
impossible
to
a
people
of
lesser
mental
attainments
and
their
profound
enjoyment
of
her
playing
burned
into
her
mind
by
the
telepathic
almost
hypnotic
power
of
the
norlaminian
mentality
raised
her
to
heights
of
power
she
had
never
before
attained
playing
as
one
inspired
she
went
through
one
tremendous
solo
after
another
holding
her
listeners
spellbound
urged
on
by
their
intense
feeling
to
carry
them
further
and
ever
further
into
the
realm
of
pure
emotional
harmony
the
bell
which
ordinarily
signaled
the
end
of
the
period
of
relaxation
did
not
sound
for
the
first
time
in
thousands
of
years
the
planet
of
norlamin
deserted
its
rigid
schedule
of
life
to
listen
to
one
pouring
out
her
very
soul
upon
her
incomparable
violin
the
final
note
of
memories
died
away
in
a
diminuendo
wail
and
the
musician
almost
collapsed
into
seaton
arms
the
profound
silence
more
impressive
far
than
any
possible
applause
was
soon
broken
by
dorothy
there
i
all
right
now
dick
i
was
about
out
of
control
for
a
minute
i
wish
they
could
have
had
that
on
a
recorder
i
never
be
able
to
play
like
that
again
if
i
live
to
be
a
thousand
years
old
it
is
on
record
daughter
every
note
and
every
inflection
is
preserved
precisely
as
you
played
it
orlon
assured
her
that
is
our
only
excuse
for
allowing
you
to
continue
as
you
did
almost
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
while
we
can
not
really
understand
an
artistic
mind
of
the
peculiar
type
to
which
yours
belongs
yet
we
realized
that
each
time
you
play
you
are
doing
something
that
no
one
not
even
yourself
can
ever
do
again
in
precisely
the
same
subtle
fashion
therefore
we
allowed
in
fact
encouraged
you
to
go
on
as
long
as
that
creative
impulse
should
endure
not
merely
for
our
pleasure
in
hearing
it
great
though
that
pleasure
was
but
in
the
hope
that
our
workers
in
music
could
by
a
careful
analysis
of
your
product
determine
quantitatively
the
exact
vibrations
or
overtones
which
make
the
difference
between
emotional
and
intellectual
music
chapter
xi
into
a
sun
as
rovol
and
seaton
approached
the
physics
laboratory
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
of
labor
another
small
airboat
occupied
by
one
man
drew
up
beside
them
and
followed
them
to
the
ground
the
stranger
another
ancient
greeted
rovol
cordially
and
was
introduced
to
seaton
as
caslor
the
first
of
mechanism
truly
this
is
a
high
point
in
the
course
of
norlaminian
science
my
young
friend
caslor
acknowledged
the
introduction
smilingly
you
have
enabled
us
to
put
into
practice
many
things
which
our
ancestors
studied
in
theory
for
many
a
wearisome
cycle
of
time
turning
to
rovol
he
went
on
i
understand
that
you
require
a
particularly
precise
directional
mechanism
i
know
well
that
it
must
indeed
be
one
of
exceeding
precision
and
delicacy
for
the
controls
you
yourself
have
built
are
able
to
hold
upon
any
point
however
moving
within
the
limits
of
our
immediate
solar
system
we
require
controls
a
million
times
as
delicate
as
any
i
have
constructed
said
rovol
therefore
i
have
called
your
surpassing
skill
into
it
is
senseless
for
me
to
attempt
a
task
in
which
i
would
be
doomed
to
failure
we
intend
to
send
out
a
projection
something
none
of
our
ancestors
ever
even
dreamed
of
which
with
its
inconceivable
velocity
of
propagation
will
enable
us
to
explore
any
region
in
the
galaxy
as
quickly
as
we
now
visit
our
closest
sister
planet
knowing
the
dimensions
of
this
our
galaxy
you
can
readily
understand
the
exact
degree
of
precision
required
to
hold
upon
a
point
at
its
outermost
edge
truly
a
problem
worthy
of
any
man
brain
caslor
replied
after
a
moment
thought
those
small
circles
pointing
to
the
hour
and
declination
circles
which
seaton
had
thought
the
ultimate
in
precise
measurement
of
angular
magnitudes
are
of
course
useless
i
shall
have
to
construct
large
and
accurate
circles
and
in
order
to
produce
the
slow
and
fast
motions
of
the
required
nature
without
creep
slip
play
or
backlash
i
shall
require
a
pure
torque
capable
of
being
increased
by
infinitesimal
increments
pure
torque
he
thought
deeply
for
a
time
then
went
on
no
or
chain
mechanism
can
be
built
of
sufficient
tightness
since
in
any
mechanism
there
is
some
freedom
of
motion
however
slight
and
for
this
purpose
the
director
must
have
no
freedom
of
motion
whatever
we
must
have
a
pure
torque
and
the
only
possible
force
answering
our
requirements
is
the
four
hundred
band
of
the
fourth
order
i
shall
therefore
be
compelled
to
develop
that
band
the
director
must
of
course
have
a
full
equatorial
mounting
with
circles
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
diameter
must
your
projector
tube
be
longer
than
that
for
correct
design
that
length
will
be
ample
the
mounting
must
be
capable
of
rotation
through
the
full
circle
of
arc
in
either
plane
and
must
be
driven
in
precisely
the
motion
required
to
neutralize
the
motion
of
our
planet
which
as
you
know
is
somewhat
irregular
additional
fast
and
slow
motions
must
of
course
be
provided
to
rotate
the
mechanism
upon
each
graduated
circle
at
the
will
of
the
operator
it
is
my
idea
to
make
the
outer
supporting
tube
quite
large
so
that
you
will
have
full
freedom
with
your
inner
or
projector
tube
proper
it
seems
to
me
that
dimensions
would
perhaps
be
as
good
as
any
perfectly
satisfactory
you
have
the
apparatus
well
in
mind
these
things
will
consume
some
time
how
soon
will
you
require
this
mechanism
asked
caslor
we
also
have
much
to
do
two
periods
of
labor
let
us
say
or
if
you
require
them
three
it
is
well
two
periods
will
be
ample
time
i
was
afraid
that
you
might
need
it
today
and
the
work
can
not
be
accomplished
in
one
period
of
labor
the
mounting
will
of
course
be
prepared
in
the
area
of
experiment
farewell
you
are
going
to
build
the
final
projector
here
then
seaton
asked
as
caslor
flier
disappeared
we
shall
build
it
here
then
transport
it
to
the
area
where
its
dirigible
housing
will
be
ready
to
receive
it
all
mechanisms
of
that
type
are
set
up
there
not
only
is
the
location
convenient
to
all
interested
but
there
are
to
be
found
all
necessary
tools
equipment
and
material
also
and
not
least
important
for
such
work
as
we
contemplate
the
entire
area
of
experiment
is
anchored
immovably
to
the
solid
crust
of
the
planet
so
that
there
can
be
not
even
the
slightest
vibration
to
affect
the
direction
of
our
beams
of
force
which
must
of
course
be
very
long
he
closed
the
master
switches
of
his
and
the
two
resumed
work
where
they
had
left
off
the
control
panel
was
soon
finished
rovol
then
plated
an
immense
cylinder
of
copper
and
placed
it
in
the
he
next
set
up
an
entirely
new
system
of
refractory
and
installed
additional
sealed
through
the
floor
and
extending
deep
into
the
ground
below
explaining
as
he
worked
you
see
son
we
must
lose
one
of
one
per
cent
of
our
total
energy
and
provision
must
be
made
for
its
dissipation
in
order
to
avoid
destruction
of
the
laboratory
these
resistances
are
the
simplest
means
of
disposing
of
the
wasted
power
i
get
you
but
say
how
about
disposing
of
it
when
we
get
the
thing
in
a
ship
out
in
space
we
picked
up
pretty
heavy
charges
in
the
so
heavy
that
i
had
to
hold
up
several
times
in
the
ionized
layer
of
an
atmosphere
while
they
faded
and
this
outfit
will
burn
up
tons
of
copper
where
the
old
ones
used
ounces
in
the
projected
we
shall
install
converters
to
utilize
all
the
energy
so
that
there
will
be
no
loss
whatever
since
such
converters
must
be
designed
and
built
especially
for
each
installation
and
since
they
require
a
high
degree
of
precision
it
is
not
worth
while
to
construct
them
for
a
purely
temporary
mechanism
such
as
this
one
the
walls
of
the
laboratory
were
opened
ventilating
blowers
were
built
and
refrigerating
coils
were
set
up
everywhere
even
in
the
tubular
structure
and
behind
the
visiplates
after
assuring
themselves
that
everything
combustible
had
been
removed
the
two
scientists
put
on
under
their
helmets
goggles
whose
protecting
lenses
could
be
built
up
to
any
desired
thickness
rovol
then
threw
a
switch
and
a
hemisphere
of
flaming
golden
radiance
surrounded
the
laboratory
and
extended
for
miles
upon
all
sides
i
get
most
of
the
stuff
you
pulled
so
far
but
why
such
a
light
asked
seaton
as
a
warning
this
entire
area
will
be
filled
with
dangerous
frequencies
and
that
light
is
a
warning
for
all
uninsulated
persons
to
give
our
theater
of
operations
a
wide
berth
i
see
what
next
all
that
remains
to
be
done
is
to
take
our
and
go
replied
rovol
as
he
took
from
a
cupboard
the
largest
faidon
that
seaton
had
ever
seen
oh
that
what
you
going
to
use
you
know
i
been
wondering
about
that
stuff
i
took
one
back
with
me
to
the
earth
to
experiment
on
i
gave
it
everything
i
could
think
of
and
could
touch
it
i
even
make
it
change
its
temperature
what
is
it
anyway
it
is
not
matter
at
all
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
it
is
almost
pure
crystallized
energy
you
have
of
course
noticed
that
it
looks
transparent
but
that
it
is
not
you
can
not
see
into
its
substance
a
millionth
of
a
micron
the
illusion
of
transparency
being
purely
a
surface
phenomenon
and
peculiar
to
this
one
form
of
substance
i
have
told
you
that
the
ether
is
a
substance
this
also
is
a
substance
but
it
is
crystalline
whereas
the
ether
is
probably
fluid
and
amorphous
you
might
call
this
faidon
crystallized
ether
without
being
far
wrong
but
it
should
weigh
tons
and
it
is
hardly
heavier
than
air
or
no
wait
a
minute
gravitation
is
also
a
phenomenon
so
it
might
not
weigh
anything
at
all
but
it
would
have
terrific
mass
or
would
it
not
having
protons
crystallized
ether
would
displace
fluid
ether
so
it
might
i
give
up
it
too
deep
for
me
said
seaton
its
theory
is
abstruse
and
i
can
not
explain
it
to
you
any
more
fully
than
i
have
until
after
we
have
given
you
a
knowledge
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
orders
pure
material
would
be
without
weight
and
without
mass
but
these
crystals
as
they
are
found
are
not
absolutely
pure
in
crystallizing
from
the
magma
they
entrapped
sufficient
numbers
of
particles
of
the
higher
orders
to
give
them
the
characteristics
which
you
have
observed
the
impurities
however
are
not
sufficient
in
quantity
to
offer
a
point
of
attack
to
any
ordinary
reagent
but
how
could
such
material
possibly
be
formed
it
could
be
formed
only
in
some
such
gigantic
cosmic
body
as
this
our
green
system
formed
incalculable
ages
ago
when
all
the
mass
comprising
it
existed
as
one
colossal
sun
picture
for
yourself
the
condition
in
the
center
of
that
sun
it
has
attained
the
theoretical
maximum
of
temperature
some
seventy
million
of
your
centigrade
degrees
the
electrons
have
been
stripped
from
the
protons
until
the
entire
central
core
is
one
solid
ball
of
neutronium
and
can
be
compressed
no
more
without
destruction
of
the
protons
themselves
still
the
pressure
increases
the
temperature
already
at
the
theoretical
maximum
can
no
longer
increase
what
happens
disruption
precisely
and
just
at
the
instant
of
disruption
during
the
very
instant
of
generation
of
the
frightful
forces
that
are
to
hurl
suns
planets
and
satellites
millions
of
miles
out
into
space
in
that
instant
of
time
as
a
result
of
those
unimaginable
temperatures
and
pressures
the
faidon
comes
into
being
it
can
be
formed
only
by
the
absolute
maximum
of
temperature
and
at
a
pressure
which
can
exist
only
momentarily
even
in
the
largest
conceivable
masses
then
how
can
you
make
a
lens
of
it
it
must
be
impossible
to
work
it
in
any
way
it
can
not
be
worked
in
any
ordinary
way
but
we
shall
take
this
crystal
into
the
depths
of
that
white
dwarf
star
into
a
region
in
which
obtain
pressures
and
temperatures
only
less
than
those
giving
it
birth
there
we
shall
play
forces
upon
it
which
under
those
conditions
will
be
able
to
work
it
quite
readily
hm
m
i
want
to
see
that
let
go
they
seated
themselves
at
the
panels
and
rovol
began
to
manipulate
keys
levers
and
dials
instantly
a
complex
structure
of
visible
force
rods
beams
and
flat
areas
of
flaming
scarlet
energy
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
tubular
network
why
red
merely
to
render
them
visible
one
can
not
work
well
with
invisible
tools
hence
i
have
imposed
a
colored
light
frequency
upon
the
invisible
frequencies
of
the
forces
we
will
have
an
assortment
of
colors
if
you
prefer
and
as
he
spoke
each
ray
assumed
a
different
color
so
that
the
end
of
the
projector
was
almost
lost
beneath
a
riot
of
color
the
structure
of
force
which
seaton
knew
was
the
secondary
projector
swung
around
as
if
sentient
and
a
lurid
green
ray
extended
itself
picked
up
the
faidon
and
lengthened
out
hurling
the
jewel
a
thousand
yards
out
through
the
open
side
of
the
laboratory
rovol
moved
more
controls
and
the
structure
again
righted
itself
swinging
back
into
perfect
alignment
with
the
tube
and
carrying
the
faidon
upon
its
extremity
a
thousand
yards
beyond
the
roof
of
the
laboratory
we
are
now
ready
to
start
our
projection
be
sure
your
suit
and
goggles
are
perfectly
tight
we
must
see
what
we
are
doing
so
the
must
be
heterodyned
upon
our
carrier
wave
therefore
the
laboratory
and
all
its
neighborhood
will
be
flooded
with
dangerous
frequencies
from
the
sun
we
are
to
visit
as
well
as
with
those
from
our
own
generators
chief
all
tight
here
you
say
it
ten
to
that
star
how
long
it
going
to
take
us
to
get
there
about
ten
minutes
we
could
travel
that
far
in
less
than
ten
seconds
but
for
the
fact
that
we
must
take
the
faidon
with
us
slight
as
is
its
mass
it
will
require
much
energy
in
its
acceleration
our
projections
of
course
have
no
mass
and
will
require
only
the
energy
of
propagation
illustration
into
the
visiplate
he
was
out
in
space
in
person
hurtling
through
space
at
a
pace
beside
which
the
best
effort
of
the
skylark
seemed
the
veriest
rovol
flicked
a
finger
a
massive
pair
of
plunger
switches
shot
into
their
sockets
and
seaton
seated
at
his
board
and
staring
into
his
visiplate
was
astounded
to
find
that
he
apparently
possessed
a
dual
personality
he
that
he
was
seated
motionless
in
the
chair
in
the
base
of
the
rigidly
anchored
primary
projector
and
by
taking
his
eyes
away
from
the
visiplate
before
him
he
could
see
that
nothing
in
the
laboratory
had
changed
except
that
the
pyrotechnic
display
from
the
was
of
unusual
intensity
yet
looking
into
the
visiplate
he
was
out
in
space
hurtling
through
space
at
a
pace
beside
which
the
best
effort
of
the
seemed
the
veriest
crawl
swinging
his
controls
to
look
backward
he
gasped
as
he
saw
so
stupendous
was
their
velocity
that
the
green
system
was
only
barely
discernible
as
a
faint
green
star
again
looking
forward
it
seemed
as
though
a
fierce
white
star
had
separated
from
the
immovable
firmament
and
was
now
so
close
to
the
structure
of
force
in
which
he
was
riding
that
it
was
already
showing
a
disk
perceptible
to
the
unaided
eye
a
few
moments
more
and
the
splendor
became
so
intense
that
the
watchers
began
to
build
up
layer
by
layer
the
protective
goggles
before
their
eyes
as
they
approached
still
closer
falling
with
their
unthinkable
velocity
into
that
incandescent
inferno
a
sight
was
revealed
to
their
eyes
such
as
man
had
never
before
been
privileged
to
gaze
upon
they
were
falling
into
a
white
dwarf
star
could
see
everything
visible
during
such
an
journey
and
would
live
to
remember
what
they
had
seen
they
saw
the
magnificent
spectacle
of
solar
prominences
shooting
hundreds
of
thousands
of
miles
into
space
and
directly
in
their
path
they
saw
an
immense
sunspot
a
combined
volcanic
eruption
and
cyclonic
storm
in
a
medium
of
blinding
incandescence
better
dodge
that
spot
had
we
ace
might
it
be
generating
interfering
frequencies
cried
seaton
it
is
undoubtedly
generating
rays
but
nothing
can
interfere
with
us
since
we
are
controlling
every
component
of
our
beam
from
norlamin
seaton
gripped
his
violently
and
involuntarily
drew
himself
together
into
the
smallest
possible
compass
as
with
their
awful
speed
unchecked
they
plunged
through
that
flaming
incandescent
photosphere
and
on
straight
down
into
the
unexplored
unimaginable
interior
of
that
frightful
and
searing
orb
through
the
protecting
goggles
now
a
full
four
inches
of
that
peculiar
golden
shielding
metal
seaton
could
see
the
structure
of
force
in
which
he
was
and
could
also
see
the
faidon
in
outline
as
transparent
diamonds
are
visible
in
equally
transparent
water
their
apparent
motion
slowed
rapidly
and
the
material
about
them
thickened
and
became
more
and
more
opaque
the
faidon
drew
back
toward
them
until
it
was
actually
touching
the
projector
and
eddy
currents
and
striae
became
visible
in
the
mass
about
them
as
their
progress
grew
slower
and
slower
something
gone
screwy
demanded
seaton
not
at
all
everything
is
working
perfectly
the
substance
is
now
so
dense
that
it
is
becoming
opaque
to
rays
of
the
fourth
order
so
that
we
are
now
partially
displacing
the
medium
instead
of
moving
through
it
without
friction
at
the
point
where
we
can
barely
see
to
work
that
is
when
the
rays
will
be
so
retarded
that
they
can
no
longer
carry
the
heterodyned
light
waves
without
complete
distortion
we
shall
stop
automatically
as
the
material
at
that
depth
will
have
the
required
density
to
refract
the
rays
to
the
correct
degree
how
can
our
foundations
stand
it
asked
seaton
this
stuff
must
be
a
hundred
times
as
dense
as
platinum
already
and
we
must
he
pushing
a
horrible
load
in
going
through
it
we
are
exerting
no
force
whatever
upon
our
foundations
nor
upon
norlamin
the
force
is
transmitted
without
loss
from
the
in
our
laboratory
to
this
secondary
projector
here
inside
the
star
where
it
is
liberated
in
the
correct
band
to
pull
us
through
the
mass
using
all
the
mass
ahead
of
us
as
anchorage
when
we
wish
to
return
we
shall
simply
change
the
pull
into
a
push
ah
we
are
now
at
a
standstill
now
comes
the
most
important
moment
of
the
entire
project
all
apparent
motion
had
ceased
and
seaton
could
see
only
dimly
the
outlines
of
the
faidon
now
directly
before
his
eyes
the
structure
of
force
slowly
warped
around
until
its
front
portion
held
the
faidon
as
in
a
vise
rovol
pressed
a
lever
and
behind
them
in
the
laboratory
four
enormous
plunger
switches
drove
home
a
plane
of
pure
energy
flaming
radiantly
even
in
the
indescribable
incandescence
of
the
core
of
that
seething
star
bisected
the
faidon
neatly
and
ten
gigantic
beams
five
upon
each
half
of
the
jewel
rapidly
molded
two
sections
of
a
hollow
lens
the
two
sections
were
then
brought
together
by
the
closing
of
the
jaws
of
the
mighty
vise
their
edges
in
exact
alignment
instantly
the
plane
and
the
beams
of
energy
became
transformed
into
two
terrific
opposing
tubes
of
force
vibrant
glowing
tubes
whose
edges
in
contact
coincided
with
the
almost
invisible
seam
between
the
two
halves
of
the
lens
like
a
welding
arc
raised
to
the
power
these
two
immeasurable
and
irresistible
forces
met
exactly
in
opposition
a
meeting
of
such
incredible
violence
that
seismic
disturbances
occurred
throughout
the
entire
mass
of
that
dense
star
sunspots
of
unprecedented
size
appeared
prominences
erupted
to
hundreds
of
times
their
normal
distances
and
although
the
two
scientists
deep
in
the
core
of
the
tormented
star
were
unaware
of
what
was
happening
upon
its
surface
convulsion
after
titanic
convulsion
wracked
the
mighty
globe
and
enormous
masses
of
molten
and
gaseous
material
were
riven
from
it
and
hurled
far
out
into
space
masses
which
would
in
time
become
planets
of
that
youthful
and
turbulent
luminary
seaton
felt
his
grow
hot
suddenly
it
became
icy
cold
and
knowing
that
rovol
had
energized
the
refrigerator
system
seaton
turned
away
from
the
fascinating
welding
operation
for
a
quick
look
around
the
laboratory
as
he
did
so
he
realized
rovol
vast
knowledge
and
understood
the
reason
for
the
new
system
of
and
as
well
as
the
necessity
for
the
scheme
of
refrigeration
even
through
the
practically
opaque
goggles
he
could
see
that
the
laboratory
was
one
mass
of
genuine
lightning
not
only
from
the
but
from
every
metallic
corner
and
protuberance
the
losses
from
the
disintegrating
bar
were
hurling
themselves
upon
the
flaring
and
the
very
air
of
the
room
renewed
second
by
second
though
it
was
by
the
powerful
blowers
was
beginning
to
take
on
the
pearly
luster
of
the
corona
the
bar
was
plainly
visible
a
scintillating
demon
of
pure
violet
radiance
and
a
momentary
spasm
of
fear
seized
him
as
he
saw
how
rapidly
that
great
mass
of
copper
was
shrinking
fear
that
their
power
would
be
exhausted
with
their
task
still
uncompleted
but
the
calculations
of
the
aged
physicist
had
been
accurate
the
lens
was
completed
with
some
hundreds
of
pounds
of
copper
to
spare
and
that
geometrical
form
with
its
precious
content
of
was
following
the
secondary
projector
back
toward
the
green
system
rovol
left
his
seat
discarded
his
armor
and
signaled
seaton
to
do
the
same
i
got
to
hand
it
to
you
ace
you
sure
are
a
blinding
flash
and
a
deafening
report
seaton
exclaimed
writhing
out
of
his
insulating
suit
i
feel
as
though
i
been
pulled
through
a
and
riveted
over
on
both
ends
how
big
a
lens
did
you
make
anyway
looked
as
though
it
would
hold
a
couple
of
liters
maybe
three
its
contents
are
almost
exactly
three
liters
hm
m
seven
and
a
half
million
kilograms
say
eight
thousand
tons
mass
i
say
to
put
into
a
gallon
jug
of
course
being
inside
the
faidon
it
wo
have
any
weight
but
it
have
all
its
full
quota
of
inertia
that
why
you
taking
so
long
to
bring
it
in
of
course
yes
the
projector
will
now
bring
it
here
into
the
laboratory
without
any
further
attention
from
us
the
period
of
labor
is
about
to
end
and
tomorrow
we
shall
find
the
lens
awaiting
us
when
we
arrive
to
begin
work
how
about
cooling
it
off
it
had
a
temperature
of
something
like
forty
million
degree
centigrade
before
you
started
working
on
it
and
when
you
got
done
with
it
it
was
hot
you
forgetting
again
son
remember
that
the
hot
dense
material
is
entirely
enclosed
in
an
envelope
impervious
to
all
vibrations
longer
than
those
of
the
fifth
order
you
could
put
your
hand
upon
it
now
without
receiving
any
sensation
either
of
heat
or
of
cold
yeah
that
right
too
i
noticed
that
i
could
take
a
faidon
right
out
of
an
electric
arc
and
it
would
even
be
warm
i
could
explain
why
it
was
but
i
see
now
so
that
stuff
inside
that
lens
will
always
stay
as
hot
as
it
is
right
now
zowie
here
hoping
she
never
explodes
well
there
the
bell
for
once
in
my
life
i
all
ready
to
quit
when
the
whistle
blows
and
arm
in
arm
the
young
terrestrial
chemist
and
the
aged
norlaminian
physicist
strolled
out
to
their
waiting
airboat
chapter
xii
flying
visits
via
projection
well
what
to
do
asked
seaton
as
he
and
rovol
entered
the
laboratory
tear
down
this
projector
and
tackle
the
big
job
i
see
the
lens
is
here
on
schedule
so
we
can
hop
right
into
it
we
shall
have
further
use
for
this
mechanism
we
shall
need
at
least
one
more
lens
of
this
dense
material
and
other
scientists
also
may
have
need
of
one
or
two
then
too
the
new
projector
must
be
so
large
that
it
can
not
be
erected
in
this
room
as
he
spoke
rovol
seated
himself
at
his
and
ran
his
fingers
lightly
over
the
keys
the
entire
wall
of
the
laboratory
disappeared
hundreds
of
beams
of
force
darted
here
and
there
seizing
and
working
raw
materials
and
in
the
portal
there
grew
up
to
amazement
a
keyboard
and
panel
installation
such
as
the
in
his
wildest
moments
had
never
imagined
bank
upon
bank
of
keys
row
upon
row
of
keys
pedals
and
stops
resembling
somewhat
those
of
the
console
of
a
gigantic
panel
upon
panel
of
meters
switches
and
dials
all
arranged
about
two
chairs
and
within
reach
of
their
occupants
whew
that
looks
like
the
combined
nightmares
of
a
whole
flock
of
linotype
operators
and
radio
hams
exclaimed
seaton
when
the
installation
was
complete
now
that
you
got
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
there
is
not
a
control
system
in
norlamin
adequate
for
the
task
we
face
since
the
problem
of
the
projection
of
rays
of
the
fifth
order
has
heretofore
been
of
only
academic
interest
therefore
it
becomes
necessary
to
construct
such
a
control
this
mechanism
will
i
am
confident
have
a
sufficiently
wide
range
of
application
to
perform
any
operation
we
shall
require
of
it
it
sure
looks
as
though
it
could
do
almost
anything
provided
the
man
behind
it
knows
how
to
play
a
tune
on
it
but
if
that
rumble
seat
is
for
me
you
better
count
me
out
right
now
i
followed
you
for
about
fifteen
seconds
then
lost
you
completely
and
now
i
sunk
without
a
trace
said
seaton
that
is
of
course
true
and
is
a
point
i
was
careless
enough
to
overlook
rovol
thought
for
a
moment
then
got
up
crossed
the
room
to
his
control
desk
and
continued
we
shall
dismantle
the
machine
and
rebuild
it
at
once
oh
no
too
much
work
protested
seaton
you
got
it
about
done
have
you
it
is
hardly
started
two
hundred
thousand
bands
of
force
must
be
linked
to
it
each
in
its
proper
place
and
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
understand
thoroughly
every
detail
of
this
entire
projector
rovol
answered
why
i
not
ashamed
to
admit
that
i
have
got
brains
enough
to
understand
a
thing
like
that
you
have
sufficient
brain
capacity
it
is
merely
undeveloped
there
are
two
reasons
why
you
must
be
as
familiar
with
the
operation
of
this
mechanism
as
you
are
with
the
operation
of
one
of
your
earthly
automobiles
the
first
is
that
a
similar
control
is
to
be
installed
in
your
new
since
by
its
use
you
can
attain
a
perfection
of
handling
impossible
by
any
other
system
the
second
and
more
important
reason
is
that
neither
i
nor
any
other
man
of
norlamin
could
compel
himself
by
any
force
of
will
to
direct
a
ray
that
would
take
away
the
life
of
any
while
rovol
was
speaking
he
reversed
his
rays
and
soon
the
component
parts
of
the
new
control
had
been
disassembled
and
piled
in
orderly
array
about
the
room
hm
m
never
thought
of
that
it
right
too
mused
seaton
you
going
to
get
it
into
my
thick
skull
with
an
educator
exactly
and
rovol
sent
a
beam
of
force
after
his
highly
developed
educational
mechanism
dials
and
electrodes
were
adjusted
connections
were
established
and
the
beams
and
pencils
of
force
began
to
reconstruct
the
great
central
controlling
device
but
this
time
instead
of
being
merely
a
bewildered
spectator
seaton
was
an
active
participant
in
the
work
as
each
key
and
meter
was
wrought
and
mounted
there
were
indelibly
impressed
upon
his
brain
the
exact
reason
for
and
function
of
the
part
and
later
when
the
control
itself
was
finished
and
the
seemingly
interminable
task
of
connecting
it
up
to
the
output
of
the
transformers
had
begun
he
had
a
complete
understanding
of
everything
with
which
he
was
working
and
understood
all
the
means
by
which
the
ends
he
had
so
long
desired
were
to
be
attained
for
to
the
ancient
scientist
the
tasks
he
was
then
performing
were
the
merest
routine
to
be
performed
in
reflex
fashion
and
he
devoted
most
of
his
attention
to
transferring
from
his
own
brain
to
that
of
his
young
assistant
as
much
of
his
stupendous
knowledge
as
the
smaller
brain
of
the
terrestrial
was
capable
of
absorbing
more
and
more
rapidly
as
the
work
progressed
the
mighty
flood
of
knowledge
poured
into
seaton
mind
after
an
hour
or
so
when
enough
connections
had
been
made
so
that
automatic
forces
could
be
so
directed
as
to
finish
the
job
rovol
and
seaton
left
the
laboratory
and
went
into
the
living
room
as
they
walked
the
educator
accompanied
them
borne
upon
its
beam
of
force
your
brain
is
behaving
very
nicely
indeed
said
rovol
much
better
than
i
would
have
thought
possible
from
its
size
in
fact
it
may
be
possible
for
me
to
transfer
to
you
all
the
knowledge
i
have
which
might
be
of
use
to
you
that
is
why
i
took
you
away
from
the
laboratory
what
do
you
think
of
the
idea
our
psychologists
have
always
maintained
that
none
of
us
ever
uses
more
than
a
minute
fraction
of
the
actual
capacity
of
his
brain
seaton
replied
after
a
moment
thought
if
you
think
you
can
give
me
even
a
percentage
of
your
knowledge
without
killing
me
go
to
it
i
for
it
strong
knowing
that
you
would
be
i
have
already
requested
drasnik
the
first
of
psychology
to
come
here
and
he
has
just
arrived
answered
rovol
and
as
he
spoke
that
personage
entered
the
room
when
the
facts
had
been
set
before
him
the
psychologist
nodded
his
head
that
is
quite
possible
he
said
with
enthusiasm
and
i
will
be
only
too
glad
to
assist
in
such
an
operation
but
listen
protested
seaton
you
probably
change
my
whole
personality
rovol
brain
is
three
times
the
size
of
mine
nothing
of
the
kind
drasnik
reproved
him
as
you
have
said
you
are
using
only
a
minute
portion
of
the
active
mass
of
your
brain
the
same
thing
is
true
with
us
many
millions
of
cycles
would
have
to
pass
before
we
would
be
able
to
fill
the
brains
we
now
have
then
why
are
your
brains
so
large
merely
a
provision
of
nature
that
no
possible
accession
of
knowledge
shall
find
her
storehouse
too
small
replied
drasnik
positively
ready
all
three
donned
the
headsets
and
a
wave
of
mental
force
swept
into
seaton
mind
a
wave
of
such
power
that
the
terrestrial
every
sense
wilted
under
the
impact
he
did
not
faint
he
did
not
lose
consciousness
he
simply
lost
all
control
of
every
nerve
and
fiber
as
his
entire
brain
passed
into
the
control
of
the
immense
mentality
of
the
first
of
psychology
and
became
a
purely
receptive
plastic
medium
upon
which
to
impress
the
knowledge
of
the
aged
physicist
hour
after
hour
the
transfer
continued
seaton
lying
limp
as
though
lifeless
the
two
norlaminians
tense
and
rigid
every
faculty
concentrated
upon
the
ignorant
virgin
brain
exposed
to
their
gaze
finally
the
operation
was
complete
and
seaton
released
from
the
weird
hypnotic
grip
of
that
stupendous
mind
gasped
shook
himself
and
writhed
to
his
feet
great
cat
he
exclaimed
his
eyes
wide
with
astonishment
i
have
believed
there
was
as
much
to
know
in
the
entire
universe
as
i
know
right
now
and
i
know
it
as
well
as
i
ever
knew
elementary
algebra
thanks
fellows
a
million
times
but
say
did
you
leave
any
open
spaces
for
more
in
one
way
i
seem
to
know
less
than
i
did
before
there
so
much
more
to
find
out
can
i
learn
anything
more
or
did
you
fill
me
up
to
capacity
the
psychologist
who
had
been
listening
to
the
exuberant
youth
with
undisguised
pleasure
spoke
calmly
the
mere
fact
that
you
appreciate
your
comparative
ignorance
shows
that
you
are
still
capable
of
learning
your
capacity
to
learn
is
greater
than
it
ever
was
before
even
though
the
waste
space
has
been
reduced
much
to
our
surprise
rovol
and
i
gave
you
all
of
his
knowledge
that
would
be
of
any
use
to
you
and
some
of
my
own
and
still
theoretically
you
can
add
to
it
more
than
nine
times
the
total
of
your
present
knowledge
the
psychologist
departed
and
rovol
and
seaton
returned
to
the
laboratory
where
the
forces
were
still
merrily
at
work
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
done
to
hasten
the
connecting
and
it
was
late
in
the
following
period
of
labor
before
they
could
begin
the
actual
construction
of
the
projector
once
started
however
it
progressed
with
amazing
rapidity
now
understanding
the
system
it
did
not
seem
strange
to
seaton
that
he
should
merely
actuate
a
certain
combination
of
forces
when
he
desired
a
certain
operation
performed
nor
did
it
seem
unusual
or
worthy
of
comment
that
one
flick
of
his
finger
over
that
switchboard
would
send
a
force
a
distance
of
hundreds
of
miles
to
a
factory
where
other
forces
were
busily
at
work
to
seize
a
hundred
of
transparent
purple
metal
that
were
to
form
the
backbone
of
the
projector
nor
did
it
seem
peculiar
that
the
same
force
with
no
further
instruction
should
bring
these
hundred
bars
back
to
him
in
a
high
loop
through
the
atmosphere
should
deposit
them
gently
in
a
convenient
space
near
the
site
of
operations
and
then
should
disappear
as
though
it
had
never
existed
with
such
tools
as
that
it
was
a
matter
of
only
a
few
hours
before
the
projector
was
done
a
task
that
would
have
required
years
of
planning
and
building
upon
earth
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
it
towered
above
their
heads
a
tubular
network
of
braced
and
latticed
bars
of
purple
metal
fifty
feet
in
diameter
at
the
base
and
tapering
smoothly
to
a
diameter
of
about
ten
feet
at
the
top
built
of
a
metal
thousands
of
times
as
strong
and
hard
as
steel
it
was
not
cumbersome
in
appearance
and
yet
was
strong
enough
to
be
absolutely
rigid
ten
enormous
supporting
forces
held
the
lens
of
neutronium
immovable
in
the
exact
center
of
the
upper
end
at
intervals
down
the
shaft
similar
forces
held
lenses
and
prisms
formed
from
zones
of
force
in
the
center
of
the
bottom
or
floor
of
the
towering
structure
was
the
double
controlling
system
with
a
universal
visiplate
facing
each
operator
well
rovol
that
that
remarked
seaton
as
the
last
connection
was
made
what
say
we
hop
in
and
give
the
baby
a
ride
over
to
the
area
of
experiment
caslor
must
have
the
mounting
done
and
we
got
time
enough
left
in
this
period
to
try
her
out
in
a
moment
i
am
setting
the
projector
to
go
out
to
the
dwarf
star
after
an
additional
supply
of
neutronium
seaton
knowing
from
the
data
of
their
first
journey
that
the
controls
could
be
so
set
as
to
duplicate
their
feat
in
every
particular
without
supervision
stepped
into
his
seat
in
the
new
controller
pressed
a
key
and
spoke
hi
dottie
what
on
your
mind
nothing
much
dorothy
clear
voice
answered
got
it
done
and
can
i
see
it
sure
sit
tight
and
i
send
a
boat
after
you
as
he
spoke
rovol
flier
darted
into
the
air
and
away
and
in
two
minutes
it
returned
slowing
abruptly
as
it
landed
dorothy
stepped
out
radiant
and
returned
seaton
enthusiastic
caresses
with
equal
fervor
before
she
spoke
lover
i
afraid
you
violated
all
known
speed
laws
getting
me
over
here
are
you
afraid
of
getting
pinched
nope
not
here
besides
i
did
want
to
keep
rovol
waiting
we
all
ready
to
go
hop
in
here
with
me
this
control
mine
rovol
entered
the
tube
took
his
place
and
waved
his
hand
hands
swept
over
the
keys
and
the
whole
gigantic
structure
wafted
into
the
air
still
upright
it
was
borne
upon
immense
rods
of
force
toward
the
area
of
experiment
which
was
soon
reached
covered
as
the
area
was
with
fantastic
equipment
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
their
destination
for
in
plain
sight
dominating
all
the
lesser
instruments
there
rose
a
stupendous
telescopic
mounting
with
an
enormous
hollow
tube
of
metallic
which
could
be
intended
for
nothing
else
than
their
projector
approaching
it
carefully
seaton
deftly
guided
the
projector
lengthwise
into
that
hollow
receptacle
and
anchored
it
in
the
exact
optical
axis
flashing
beams
of
force
made
short
work
of
welding
the
two
tubes
together
immovably
with
angles
and
lattices
of
the
same
purple
metal
the
terminals
of
the
motors
were
attached
to
the
controllers
and
everything
was
in
readiness
for
the
first
trial
what
special
instructions
do
we
need
to
run
it
if
any
seaton
asked
of
the
first
of
mechanism
who
had
lifted
himself
up
into
the
projector
very
little
this
motor
governs
the
hour
motion
that
one
the
right
ascension
the
potentiometers
regulate
the
degree
of
vernier
action
any
ratio
is
possible
from
direct
drive
up
to
more
than
a
hundred
million
complete
revolutions
of
that
graduated
dial
to
give
you
one
second
of
arc
plenty
fine
i
say
thanks
a
lot
ace
whither
away
rovol
any
choice
anywhere
you
please
son
since
this
is
merely
a
we
hop
over
and
tell
dunark
hello
the
tube
swung
around
into
line
with
that
distant
planet
and
seaton
stepped
down
hard
upon
a
pedal
instantly
they
seemed
infinite
myriads
of
miles
out
in
space
the
green
system
barely
visible
as
a
faint
green
star
behind
them
wow
that
ray
fast
exclaimed
the
pilot
ruefully
i
overshot
about
a
thousand
light
years
we
try
again
with
considerably
less
power
and
he
rearranged
and
reset
the
dials
and
meters
before
him
adjustment
after
adjustment
and
many
reductions
in
power
had
to
be
made
before
the
projection
ceased
leaping
millions
of
miles
at
a
touch
but
finally
the
operators
became
familiar
with
the
new
technique
and
the
ray
became
manageable
soon
they
were
hovering
above
what
had
been
mardonal
and
saw
that
all
signs
of
warfare
had
disappeared
slowly
turning
the
controls
seaton
flashed
the
projection
over
the
girdling
osnomian
sea
and
guided
it
through
the
impregnable
metal
walls
of
the
palace
into
the
throne
room
of
roban
where
they
saw
the
emperor
tarnan
the
karbix
and
dunark
in
close
conference
well
here
we
are
remarked
seaton
now
we
put
on
a
little
visibility
and
give
the
natives
a
treat
whispered
dorothy
they
hear
you
dick
we
intruding
shamefully
no
they
wo
hear
us
because
i
have
heterodyned
the
audio
in
on
the
wave
yet
and
as
for
intruding
that
exactly
what
we
came
over
here
for
he
imposed
the
audio
system
upon
the
inconceivably
high
frequency
of
their
carrier
wave
and
spoke
in
the
osnomian
tongue
greetings
roban
dunark
and
tarnan
from
seaton
all
three
jumped
to
their
feet
amazed
staring
about
the
empty
room
as
seaton
went
on
i
am
not
here
in
person
i
am
simply
sending
you
my
projection
just
a
moment
and
i
will
put
on
a
little
visibility
he
brought
more
forces
into
play
and
solid
images
of
force
appeared
in
the
great
hall
images
of
the
three
occupants
of
the
controller
introductions
and
greetings
over
seaton
spoke
briefly
and
to
the
point
we
got
everything
we
came
after
much
more
than
i
had
any
idea
we
could
get
you
need
have
no
more
fear
of
the
fenachrone
we
have
found
a
science
superior
to
theirs
but
much
remains
to
be
done
and
we
have
none
too
much
time
therefore
i
have
come
to
you
with
certain
requests
the
overlord
has
but
to
command
replied
roban
not
command
since
we
are
all
working
together
for
a
common
cause
in
the
name
of
that
cause
dunark
i
ask
you
to
come
to
me
at
once
accompanied
by
tarnan
and
any
others
you
may
select
you
will
be
piloted
by
a
ray
which
we
shall
set
upon
your
controls
upon
your
way
here
you
will
visit
the
first
city
of
dasor
another
planet
where
you
will
pick
up
sacner
carfon
who
will
be
awaiting
you
there
as
you
direct
so
it
shall
be
and
seaton
flashed
the
projector
to
the
neighboring
planet
of
urvania
there
he
found
that
the
gigantic
he
had
ordered
had
been
completed
and
requested
urvan
and
his
to
tow
it
to
norlamin
piloted
by
a
ray
he
then
jumped
to
dasor
there
interviewing
carfon
and
being
assured
of
the
full
of
the
well
that
that
folks
said
seaton
as
he
shut
off
the
power
we
ca
do
much
more
for
a
few
days
until
the
gang
gets
here
for
the
council
of
war
how
it
be
rovol
for
me
to
practice
with
this
outfit
while
you
are
finishing
up
the
odds
and
ends
you
want
to
clean
up
you
might
suggest
to
orlon
too
that
it
be
a
good
deed
for
him
to
pilot
those
folks
over
here
as
rovol
wafted
himself
to
the
ground
from
their
lofty
station
crane
and
margaret
appeared
and
were
lifted
up
to
the
place
formerly
occupied
by
the
physicist
how
tricks
mart
i
hear
you
quite
an
astronomer
said
seaton
yes
thanks
to
orlon
and
the
first
of
psychology
he
seemed
quite
interested
in
increasing
our
earthly
knowledge
i
certainly
know
much
more
than
i
had
ever
hoped
to
know
of
anything
yeah
you
can
pilot
us
to
the
fenachrone
system
now
without
any
trouble
you
also
absorbed
some
ethnology
and
kindred
sciences
what
think
with
dunark
and
urvan
do
we
know
enough
to
go
ahead
or
should
we
take
a
chance
on
holding
things
up
while
we
get
acquainted
with
some
of
the
other
peoples
of
these
planets
of
the
green
system
delay
is
dangerous
as
our
time
is
already
short
crane
replied
after
a
time
we
know
enough
i
believe
and
furthermore
any
additional
assistance
is
problematical
in
fact
it
is
more
than
doubtful
the
norlaminians
have
surveyed
the
system
rather
thoroughly
and
no
other
planet
seems
to
have
inhabitants
who
have
even
approached
the
development
attained
here
right
that
the
way
i
dope
it
exactly
we
wait
until
the
gang
assembles
then
go
over
the
top
in
the
meantime
i
called
you
over
to
take
a
ride
in
this
projector
it
a
darb
i
like
to
shoot
for
the
fenachrone
system
first
but
i
do
quite
dare
to
do
to
you
scoffed
margaret
how
come
cancel
the
change
it
to
not
to
why
because
while
they
ca
work
through
a
zone
of
force
some
of
their
real
scientists
and
they
have
lots
of
them
not
like
the
soldier
we
captured
may
well
be
able
to
detect
a
ray
even
if
they
ca
work
with
them
intelligently
and
if
they
detected
our
ray
put
them
on
guard
you
are
exactly
right
dick
agreed
crane
and
there
speaks
the
norlaminian
physicist
and
not
my
old
and
reckless
playmate
richard
seaton
oh
i
do
know
i
told
you
i
was
getting
timid
as
a
mouse
but
not
sit
here
twiddling
our
thumbs
let
go
places
and
do
things
whither
away
i
want
a
destination
a
good
ways
off
not
something
in
our
own
back
yard
go
back
home
of
course
stupe
put
in
dorothy
do
you
have
to
be
told
every
little
thing
sure
never
thought
of
that
and
seaton
after
a
moment
rapid
mental
arithmetic
swung
the
great
tube
around
rapidly
adjusted
a
few
dials
and
stepped
down
upon
a
pedal
there
was
a
fleeting
instant
of
unthinkable
velocity
then
they
found
themselves
poised
somewhere
in
space
well
wonder
how
far
i
missed
it
on
my
first
shot
seaton
crisp
voice
broke
the
stunned
silence
guess
that
our
sun
over
to
the
left
ai
it
mart
yes
you
were
about
right
for
distance
and
within
a
few
tenths
of
a
laterally
that
is
fairly
close
i
should
have
said
rotten
for
these
controls
except
for
the
effect
of
relative
proper
motions
which
i
ca
calculate
yet
for
lack
of
data
i
should
be
able
to
hit
a
gnat
right
in
the
left
eye
at
this
range
and
the
difference
in
proper
motions
could
have
thrown
me
off
more
than
a
few
hundred
feet
nope
i
was
too
anxious
hurried
too
much
on
the
settings
of
the
slow
verniers
i
snap
back
and
try
it
again
he
adjusted
the
verniers
very
carefully
and
again
threw
on
the
power
again
there
was
the
sensation
of
the
barest
perceptible
moment
of
unimaginable
speed
and
they
were
in
the
air
some
fifty
feet
above
the
ground
of
crane
field
almost
above
the
testing
shed
seaton
rapidly
adjusted
the
motors
until
they
were
perfectly
stationary
relative
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
you
are
improving
commended
crane
yeah
that
more
like
it
guess
maybe
i
can
learn
in
time
to
shoot
this
gun
well
let
go
down
they
dropped
through
the
roof
into
the
laboratory
where
maxwell
now
in
charge
of
the
place
was
watching
a
reaction
and
occasionally
taking
notes
hi
max
seaton
speaking
on
a
television
got
your
range
exactly
chief
apparently
i
can
hear
you
perfectly
but
ca
see
anything
maxwell
stared
about
the
empty
laboratory
you
will
in
a
minute
i
knew
i
had
you
but
did
want
to
scare
you
out
of
a
year
growth
and
seaton
thickened
the
image
until
they
were
plainly
visible
please
call
vaneman
on
the
phone
and
tell
him
you
in
touch
with
us
directed
seaton
as
soon
as
greetings
had
been
exchanged
better
yet
after
you
broken
it
to
them
gently
dot
can
talk
to
them
then
we
go
over
and
see
the
connection
established
dorothy
image
floated
up
to
the
telephone
and
apparently
spoke
mother
this
is
the
weirdest
thing
you
ever
imagined
we
not
really
here
at
all
you
know
we
actually
here
in
norlamin
no
i
mean
just
sending
a
kind
of
a
talking
picture
of
us
to
see
you
on
earth
here
oh
no
i
do
know
anything
about
it
it
like
a
talkie
sent
by
radio
only
worse
because
i
am
saying
this
myself
right
now
without
any
rehearsal
or
anything
we
did
want
to
burst
in
on
you
without
warning
because
you
be
sure
to
think
you
were
seeing
actual
ghosts
and
we
not
dead
the
least
bit
we
having
the
most
perfectly
gorgeous
time
you
ever
imagined
oh
i
so
excited
i
ca
explain
anything
even
if
i
knew
anything
about
it
to
explain
we
all
four
of
us
be
over
there
in
about
a
second
and
tell
you
all
about
it
indeed
it
was
even
less
than
a
second
vaneman
was
still
in
the
act
of
hanging
up
the
receiver
when
the
image
materialized
in
the
living
room
of
dorothy
girlhood
home
hello
mother
and
dad
seaton
voice
was
cheerful
but
i
thicken
this
up
so
you
can
see
us
better
in
a
minute
but
think
that
we
are
flesh
and
blood
you
see
simply
talking
pictures
of
ourselves
transmitted
by
radio
for
a
long
time
and
vaneman
chatted
with
the
four
visitors
from
so
far
away
in
space
while
seaton
gloried
in
the
working
of
that
marvelous
projector
well
our
time
about
up
seaton
finally
ended
the
visit
the
going
to
blow
in
five
minutes
and
they
do
like
overtime
work
here
where
we
are
we
drop
in
and
see
you
again
maybe
sometime
before
we
come
back
do
you
know
yet
when
you
are
coming
back
asked
vaneman
not
an
idea
in
the
world
mother
any
more
than
we
had
when
we
started
but
we
getting
along
fine
having
the
time
of
our
lives
and
are
learning
a
lot
besides
and
seaton
clicked
off
the
power
as
they
descended
from
the
projector
and
walked
toward
the
waiting
airboat
seaton
fell
in
beside
rovol
you
know
they
got
our
new
cruiser
built
of
dagal
and
are
bringing
it
over
here
dagal
good
stuff
but
it
is
as
good
as
your
purple
metal
inoson
which
is
the
theoretical
ultimate
in
strength
possible
for
any
material
possessing
molecular
structure
why
would
it
be
a
sound
idea
to
flash
it
into
inoson
when
it
gets
here
that
would
be
an
excellent
idea
and
we
shall
do
so
it
also
has
occurred
to
me
that
caslor
of
mechanism
astron
of
energy
satrazon
of
chemistry
myself
and
one
of
two
others
should
collaborate
in
installing
a
very
complete
projector
in
the
new
as
well
as
any
other
equipment
which
may
seem
desirable
the
security
of
the
universe
may
depend
upon
the
abilities
and
qualities
of
you
terrestrials
and
your
vessel
and
therefore
should
be
left
undone
which
it
is
possible
for
us
to
do
you
chirped
something
then
old
scout
thanks
you
might
do
that
while
i
attend
to
such
preliminaries
as
wiping
out
the
fenachrone
fleet
in
due
time
the
reinforcements
from
the
other
planets
arrived
and
the
mammoth
attracted
attention
even
before
it
landed
so
enormous
was
she
in
comparison
with
the
tiny
vessels
having
her
in
tow
resting
upon
the
ground
it
seemed
absurd
that
such
a
structure
could
possibly
move
under
her
own
power
for
two
miles
that
enormous
mass
of
metal
extended
over
the
and
while
it
was
very
narrow
for
its
length
still
its
fifteen
hundred
feet
of
diameter
dwarfed
everything
near
by
but
rovol
and
his
aged
smiled
happily
as
they
saw
it
erected
their
keyboards
and
set
to
work
with
a
will
meanwhile
a
group
had
gathered
about
a
conference
table
a
group
such
as
had
never
before
been
seen
together
upon
any
world
there
was
fodan
the
ancient
chief
of
the
five
of
norlamin
with
his
leonine
mane
and
flowing
beard
of
white
there
were
dunark
and
tarnan
of
osnome
and
urvan
of
urvania
and
keen
utterly
implacable
and
ruthless
in
war
there
was
sacner
carfon
twenty
three
forty
six
the
immense
hairless
dasorian
there
were
seaton
and
crane
representatives
of
our
own
earthly
civilization
seaton
opened
the
meeting
by
handing
each
man
a
headset
and
running
a
reel
showing
the
plans
of
the
fenachrone
not
only
as
he
had
secured
them
from
the
captain
of
the
marauding
vessel
but
also
everything
the
first
of
psychology
had
deduced
from
his
own
study
of
that
inhuman
brain
he
then
removed
the
reel
and
gave
them
the
tentative
plans
of
battle
headsets
removed
he
threw
the
meeting
open
for
discussion
and
discussion
there
was
in
plenty
each
man
had
ideas
which
were
thrown
upon
the
table
and
studied
for
the
most
part
calmly
and
dispassionately
the
conference
continued
until
only
one
point
was
left
upon
which
argument
waxed
so
hot
that
everyone
seemed
shouting
at
once
order
commanded
seaton
banging
his
fist
upon
the
table
osnome
and
urvania
wish
to
strike
without
warning
norlamin
and
dasor
insist
upon
a
formal
declaration
of
war
earth
has
the
deciding
vote
mart
how
do
we
vote
on
this
i
vote
for
formal
warning
for
two
reasons
one
of
which
i
believe
will
convince
even
dunark
first
because
it
is
the
fair
thing
to
do
which
reason
is
of
course
the
one
actuating
the
norlaminians
but
which
would
not
be
considered
by
osnome
nor
even
remotely
understood
by
the
fenachrone
second
i
am
certain
that
the
fenachrone
will
merely
be
enraged
by
the
warning
and
will
defy
us
then
what
will
they
do
you
have
already
said
that
you
have
been
able
to
locate
only
a
few
of
their
exploring
warships
as
soon
as
we
declare
war
upon
them
they
will
almost
certainly
send
out
torpedoes
to
every
one
of
their
ships
of
war
we
can
then
follow
the
torpedoes
with
our
rays
and
thus
will
be
enabled
to
find
and
to
destroy
their
vessels
that
settles
that
declared
the
chairman
as
a
shout
of
agreement
arose
we
shall
now
adjourn
to
the
projector
and
send
the
warning
i
have
a
ray
upon
the
torpedo
announcing
the
destruction
by
us
of
their
vessel
and
that
torpedo
will
arrive
at
its
destination
in
less
than
an
hour
it
seems
to
me
that
we
should
make
our
announcement
immediately
after
their
ruler
has
received
the
news
of
their
first
defeat
in
the
projector
where
they
were
joined
by
rovol
orlon
and
several
others
of
the
various
firsts
of
norlamin
they
flashed
out
to
the
flying
torpedo
and
seaton
grinned
at
crane
as
their
carrier
beam
went
through
the
detector
screens
of
the
fenachrone
without
setting
up
the
slightest
reaction
in
the
wake
of
that
speeding
messenger
they
flew
through
a
warm
foggy
dense
atmosphere
through
a
receiving
trap
in
the
wall
of
a
gigantic
conical
structure
and
on
into
the
telegraph
room
they
saw
the
operator
remove
spools
of
tape
from
the
torpedo
and
attach
them
to
a
magnetic
sender
heard
him
speak
pardon
your
majesty
we
have
just
received
a
emergency
torpedo
from
flagship
of
fleet
in
readiness
put
it
on
here
in
the
council
chamber
a
deep
voice
snapped
if
he
broadcasting
it
we
in
for
a
spell
of
hunting
seaton
remarked
nope
he
putting
it
on
a
tight
beam
that
fine
we
can
chase
it
up
and
with
a
narrow
detector
beam
he
traced
the
invisible
transmission
beam
into
the
council
room
this
place
seems
awfully
familiar
i
swear
i
seen
it
before
lots
of
times
seems
like
i
been
in
it
more
than
once
seaton
remarked
puzzled
as
he
looked
around
the
somber
room
with
its
dull
paneled
metal
walls
covered
with
charts
maps
screens
and
speakers
and
with
its
low
massive
furniture
oh
sure
i
familiar
with
it
from
studying
the
brain
of
that
fenachrone
captain
well
while
his
nibs
is
absorbing
the
bad
news
we
go
over
this
once
more
you
carfon
having
the
biggest
voice
of
any
of
us
ever
heard
uttering
intelligible
language
are
to
give
the
speech
you
know
about
what
to
say
when
i
say
ahead
do
your
stuff
now
everybody
else
listen
while
he
talking
i
got
to
have
audio
waves
heterodyned
both
ways
in
the
circuit
and
they
be
able
to
hear
any
noise
any
of
us
make
so
all
of
us
except
carfon
want
to
keep
absolutely
quiet
no
matter
what
happens
or
what
we
see
as
soon
as
he
done
i
cut
off
the
audio
sending
and
say
something
to
let
you
all
know
we
off
the
air
got
it
one
point
has
occurred
to
me
about
handling
the
warning
boomed
carfon
if
it
should
be
delivered
from
apparently
empty
air
directly
at
those
we
wish
to
address
it
would
give
the
enemy
an
insight
into
our
methods
which
might
be
undesirable
h
m
never
thought
of
that
it
sure
would
and
it
would
be
undesirable
agreed
seaton
let
see
we
can
get
away
from
that
by
broadcasting
it
they
have
a
very
complete
system
of
speakers
but
no
matter
how
many
speakers
a
man
may
have
he
always
has
one
on
the
general
wave
which
is
used
for
very
important
announcements
of
wide
interest
i
broadcast
you
on
that
wave
so
that
every
speaker
on
the
planet
will
be
energized
that
way
look
as
if
we
shooting
from
a
distance
you
might
talk
accordingly
if
we
have
a
minute
more
there
something
i
would
like
to
ask
dunark
broke
the
ensuing
silence
here
we
are
seeing
everything
that
is
happening
there
walls
planets
even
suns
do
not
bar
our
vision
because
of
the
carrier
wave
i
understand
that
partially
but
how
can
we
see
anything
there
i
always
thought
that
i
knew
something
about
rays
but
i
see
that
i
do
not
the
must
be
released
or
deheterodyned
close
to
the
object
viewed
with
nothing
opaque
to
light
intervening
they
must
then
be
reflected
from
the
object
seen
must
be
gathered
together
again
heterodyned
upon
the
carrier
and
retransmitted
back
to
us
and
there
is
neither
receiver
nor
transmitter
at
the
other
end
how
can
you
do
all
that
from
our
end
we
do
seaton
assured
him
at
the
other
end
there
are
all
the
things
you
mentioned
and
a
lot
more
besides
our
secondary
projector
out
there
is
composed
of
forces
visible
or
invisible
as
we
please
part
of
those
forces
comprise
the
receiving
viewing
and
sending
instruments
they
are
not
material
it
is
true
but
they
are
nevertheless
fully
as
actual
and
far
more
efficient
than
any
other
system
of
radio
television
or
telephone
in
existence
anywhere
else
it
is
force
you
know
that
makes
radio
or
television
work
the
actual
copper
insulation
and
other
matter
serve
only
to
guide
and
to
control
the
various
forces
employed
the
norlaminian
scientists
have
found
out
how
to
direct
and
control
pure
forces
without
using
the
cumbersome
and
hindering
material
substance
he
broke
off
as
the
record
from
the
torpedo
stopped
suddenly
and
the
operator
voice
came
through
a
speaker
general
fenimol
scoutship
patrolling
the
detector
zone
wishes
to
give
you
an
urgent
emergency
report
i
told
them
that
you
were
in
council
with
the
emperor
and
they
instructed
me
to
interrupt
it
no
matter
how
important
the
council
may
be
they
have
on
board
a
survivor
of
the
and
have
captured
and
killed
two
men
of
the
same
race
as
those
who
destroyed
our
vessel
they
say
that
you
will
want
their
report
without
an
instant
delay
we
do
barked
the
general
at
a
sign
from
his
ruler
put
it
on
here
run
the
rest
of
the
torpedo
report
immediately
afterward
in
the
projector
seaton
stared
at
crane
a
moment
then
a
light
of
understanding
spread
over
his
features
duquesne
of
course
i
bet
a
hat
no
other
terrestrial
is
this
far
from
home
i
ca
help
feeling
sorry
for
the
poor
devil
he
a
darn
good
man
gone
wrong
but
we
have
had
to
kill
him
ourselves
before
we
got
done
with
him
so
it
probably
as
well
they
got
him
pin
your
ears
back
everybody
and
watch
close
we
want
to
get
this
all
of
it
chapter
xiii
the
declaration
of
war
the
capital
city
of
the
fenachrone
lay
in
a
jungle
plain
surrounded
by
towering
hills
a
perfect
circle
of
immense
diameter
its
buildings
of
uniform
height
of
identical
design
and
constructed
of
the
same
dull
gray
translucent
metal
were
arranged
in
concentric
circles
like
the
annular
rings
seen
upon
the
stump
of
a
tree
between
each
ring
of
buildings
and
the
one
next
inside
it
there
were
lagoons
lawns
and
groves
lagoons
of
tepid
water
lawns
which
were
veritable
carpets
of
lush
rank
rushes
and
of
dank
mosses
groves
of
palms
gigantic
ferns
bamboos
and
numerous
tropical
growths
unknown
to
earthly
botany
at
the
very
edge
of
the
city
began
jungle
unrelieved
and
primeval
the
impenetrable
unconquerable
jungle
possible
only
to
such
meteorological
conditions
as
obtained
there
wind
there
was
none
nor
sunshine
only
occasionally
was
the
sun
of
that
reeking
world
visible
through
the
omnipresent
fog
a
pale
wan
disk
always
the
atmosphere
was
one
of
oppressive
hot
humid
vapor
in
the
exact
center
of
the
city
rose
an
immense
structure
a
terraced
cone
of
buildings
as
though
immense
disks
of
smaller
and
smaller
diameter
had
been
piled
one
upon
the
other
in
these
apartments
dwelt
the
nobility
and
the
high
officials
of
the
fenachrone
in
the
highest
disk
of
all
invisible
always
from
the
surface
of
the
planet
because
of
the
mist
were
the
apartments
of
the
emperor
of
that
monstrous
race
seated
upon
low
metal
stools
about
the
great
table
in
the
were
fenor
emperor
of
the
fenachrone
fenimol
his
and
the
full
council
of
eleven
of
the
planet
being
projected
in
the
air
before
them
was
a
moving
talking
picture
the
report
of
the
sole
survivor
of
the
warship
that
had
attacked
the
in
exact
accordance
with
the
facts
as
the
engineer
knew
them
the
details
of
the
battle
and
complete
information
concerning
the
conquerors
were
shown
as
vividly
as
though
the
scene
were
being
before
their
eyes
they
saw
the
captive
revive
in
the
and
heard
the
conversation
between
the
engineer
duquesne
and
loring
in
the
they
sped
for
days
and
weeks
with
velocity
toward
the
system
of
the
fenachrone
finally
power
reversed
they
approached
it
saw
the
planet
looming
large
and
passed
within
the
detector
screen
duquesne
tightened
the
controls
of
the
attractors
which
had
never
been
entirely
released
from
their
prisoner
thus
again
pinning
the
fenachrone
helplessly
against
the
wall
just
to
be
sure
you
do
try
to
start
something
he
explained
coldly
you
have
done
well
so
far
but
i
run
things
myself
from
now
on
so
that
you
ca
steer
us
into
a
trap
now
tell
me
exactly
how
to
go
about
getting
one
of
your
vessels
after
we
get
it
i
see
about
letting
you
go
fools
you
are
too
late
you
would
have
been
too
late
even
had
you
killed
me
out
there
in
space
and
had
fled
at
your
utmost
acceleration
did
you
but
know
it
you
are
as
dead
even
now
our
patrol
is
upon
you
duquesne
whirled
snarling
and
his
automatic
and
that
of
loring
were
leaping
out
when
an
awful
acceleration
threw
them
flat
upon
the
floor
a
magnetic
force
snatched
away
their
weapons
and
a
reduced
them
to
two
small
piles
of
gray
ash
immediately
thereafter
a
beam
of
force
from
the
patrolling
cruiser
neutralized
the
retractors
bearing
upon
the
captive
and
he
was
transferred
to
the
rescuing
vessel
the
emergency
report
ended
and
with
a
brief
torpedo
message
from
flagship
resumed
at
point
of
interruption
the
report
from
the
vessel
continued
the
story
of
its
own
destruction
but
added
little
in
the
already
complete
knowledge
of
the
disaster
fenor
of
the
fenachrone
leaped
up
from
the
table
his
terrible
eyes
glaring
venomously
teetering
in
berserk
rage
upon
his
legs
but
he
did
not
for
one
second
take
his
full
attention
from
the
report
until
it
had
been
completed
then
he
seized
the
nearest
object
which
happened
to
be
his
chair
and
with
all
his
enormous
strength
hurled
it
across
the
floor
where
it
lay
a
tattered
twisted
shapeless
mass
of
metal
thus
shall
we
treat
the
entire
race
of
the
accursed
beings
who
have
done
this
he
stormed
his
heavy
voice
reverberating
throughout
the
room
torture
dismemberment
and
annihilation
to
every
fenor
of
the
fenachrone
a
tremendous
voice
a
full
octave
lower
than
fenor
own
terrific
bass
and
of
volume
and
timbre
in
that
dense
atmosphere
boomed
from
the
speaker
its
deafening
roar
drowning
out
fenor
raging
voice
and
every
other
lesser
sound
fenor
of
the
fenachrone
i
know
that
you
hear
for
every
speaker
upon
your
reeking
planet
is
voicing
my
words
listen
well
for
this
warning
shall
not
be
repeated
i
am
speaking
by
and
with
the
authority
of
the
overlord
of
the
green
system
which
you
know
as
the
central
system
of
this
our
galaxy
upon
some
of
our
many
planets
there
are
those
who
wished
to
destroy
you
without
warning
and
out
of
hand
but
the
overlord
has
ruled
that
you
may
continue
to
live
provided
you
heed
these
his
commands
which
he
has
instructed
me
to
lay
upon
you
you
must
forthwith
abandon
forever
your
vainglorious
and
senseless
scheme
of
universal
conquest
you
must
immediately
withdraw
your
every
vessel
to
within
the
boundaries
of
your
solar
system
and
you
must
keep
them
there
henceforth
you
are
allowed
five
minutes
to
decide
whether
or
not
you
will
obey
these
commands
if
no
answer
has
been
received
at
the
end
of
the
calculated
time
the
overlord
will
know
that
you
have
defied
him
and
your
entire
race
shall
perish
utterly
well
he
knows
that
your
very
existence
is
an
affront
to
all
real
civilization
but
he
holds
that
even
such
vileness
incarnate
as
are
the
fenachrone
may
perchance
have
some
obscure
place
in
the
great
scheme
of
things
and
he
will
not
destroy
you
if
you
are
content
to
remain
in
your
proper
place
upon
your
own
dank
and
steaming
world
through
me
the
two
thousand
three
hundred
and
sacner
carfon
of
dasor
the
overlord
has
given
you
your
first
last
and
only
warning
heed
its
every
word
or
consider
it
the
formal
declaration
of
a
war
of
utter
and
complete
extinction
the
awful
voice
ceased
and
pandemonium
reigned
in
the
council
hall
obeying
a
common
impulse
each
fenachrone
leaped
to
his
feet
raised
his
huge
arms
aloft
and
roared
out
rage
and
defiance
fenor
snapped
a
command
and
the
others
fell
silent
as
he
began
howling
out
orders
operator

instantly
to

the
immediate
steps
are
taken
gentlemen
he
turned
to
the
council
his
rage
unabated
never
before
have
we
supermen
of
the
fenachrone
been
so
insulted
and
so
belittled
that
upstart
overlord
will
regret
that
warning
to
the
instant
of
his
death
which
shall
be
exquisitely
postponed
all
you
of
the
council
know
your
duties
in
such
a
time
as
this
you
are
excused
to
perform
them
general
fenimol
you
will
stay
with
me
we
shall
consider
together
such
other
details
as
require
attention
after
the
others
had
left
the
room
fenor
turned
to
the
general
have
you
any
immediate
suggestions
i
would
suggest
sending
at
once
for
ravindau
the
chief
of
the
laboratories
of
science
he
certainly
heard
the
warning
and
may
be
able
to
cast
some
light
upon
how
it
could
have
been
sent
and
from
what
point
it
came
the
emperor
spoke
into
another
sender
and
soon
the
scientist
entered
carrying
in
his
hand
a
small
instrument
upon
which
a
blue
light
blazed
do
not
talk
here
there
is
grave
danger
of
being
overheard
by
that
overlord
he
directed
tersely
and
led
the
way
into
a
compartment
of
his
private
laboratory
several
floors
below
it
may
interest
you
to
know
that
you
have
sealed
the
doom
of
our
planet
and
of
all
the
fenachrone
upon
it
ravindau
spoke
savagely
dare
you
speak
thus
to
me
your
sovereign
roared
fenor
i
dare
so
replied
the
other
coldly
when
all
the
civilization
of
a
planet
has
been
given
to
destruction
by
the
unreasoning
stupidity
and
insatiable
rapacity
of
its
royalty
allegiance
to
such
royalty
is
at
an
end
sit
down
he
thundered
as
fenor
sprang
to
his
feet
you
are
no
longer
in
your
surrounded
by
servile
guards
and
by
automatic
rays
you
are
in
my
laboratory
and
by
a
movement
of
my
finger
i
can
hurl
you
into
eternity
the
general
aware
now
that
the
warning
was
of
much
more
serious
import
than
he
had
suspected
broke
into
the
acrimonious
debate
never
mind
questions
of
royalty
he
snapped
the
safety
of
the
race
is
paramount
am
i
to
understand
that
the
situation
is
really
grave
it
is
worse
than
grave
it
is
desperate
the
only
hope
for
even
ultimate
triumph
is
for
as
many
of
us
as
possible
to
flee
instantly
clear
out
of
the
galaxy
in
the
hope
that
we
may
escape
the
certain
destruction
to
be
dealt
out
to
us
by
the
overlord
of
the
green
system
you
speak
folly
surely
returned
fenimol
our
science
is
must
be
superior
to
any
other
in
the
universe
so
thought
i
until
this
warning
came
in
and
i
had
an
opportunity
to
study
it
then
i
knew
that
we
are
opposed
by
a
science
immeasurably
higher
than
our
own
such
vermin
as
those
two
whom
one
of
our
smallest
scouts
captured
without
a
battle
vessel
and
all
in
what
respects
is
their
science
even
comparable
to
ours
not
those
vermin
no
the
one
who
calls
himself
the
overlord
that
one
is
our
master
he
can
penetrate
the
impenetrable
shield
of
force
and
can
operate
mechanisms
of
pure
force
behind
it
he
can
heterodyne
transmit
and
use
the
of
whose
very
existence
we
were
in
doubt
until
recently
while
that
warning
was
being
delivered
he
was
in
all
probability
watching
you
and
listening
to
you
face
to
face
you
in
your
ignorance
supposed
his
warning
borne
by
the
ether
and
thought
therefore
he
must
be
close
to
this
system
he
is
very
probably
at
home
in
the
central
system
and
is
at
this
moment
preparing
the
forces
he
intends
to
hurl
against
us
the
emperor
fell
back
into
his
seat
all
his
pomposity
gone
but
the
general
stiffened
eagerly
and
went
straight
to
the
point
how
do
you
know
these
things
largely
by
deduction
we
of
the
school
of
science
have
cautioned
you
repeatedly
to
postpone
the
day
of
conquest
until
we
should
have
mastered
the
secrets
of
and
of
unheeding
you
of
war
have
gone
ahead
with
your
plans
while
we
of
science
have
continued
to
study
we
know
a
little
of
the
which
we
use
every
day
and
practically
nothing
of
the
some
time
ago
i
developed
a
detector
for
which
come
to
us
from
outer
space
in
small
quantities
and
which
are
also
liberated
by
our
it
has
been
regarded
as
a
scientific
curiosity
only
but
this
day
it
proved
of
real
value
this
instrument
in
my
hand
is
such
a
detector
at
normal
impacts
of
its
light
is
blue
as
you
see
it
now
some
time
before
the
warning
sounded
it
turned
a
brilliant
red
indicating
that
an
intense
source
of
was
operating
in
the
neighborhood
by
plotting
lines
of
force
i
located
the
source
as
being
in
the
air
of
the
council
hall
almost
directly
above
the
table
of
state
therefore
the
carrier
wave
must
have
come
through
our
whole
system
of
screens
without
so
much
as
giving
an
alarm
that
fact
alone
proves
it
to
have
been
an
furthermore
it
carried
through
those
screens
and
released
in
the
council
room
a
system
of
forces
of
great
complexity
as
is
shown
by
their
ability
to
broadcast
from
those
pure
forces
without
material
aid
a
modulated
wave
in
the
exact
frequency
required
to
energize
our
general
speakers
as
soon
as
i
perceived
these
facts
i
threw
about
the
council
room
a
screen
of
force
entirely
impervious
to
anything
longer
than
the
warning
continued
and
i
then
knew
that
our
fears
were
only
too
well
grounded
that
there
is
in
this
galaxy
somewhere
a
race
vastly
superior
to
ours
in
science
and
that
our
destruction
is
a
matter
of
hours
perhaps
of
minutes
are
these
then
of
such
a
dangerous
character
asked
the
general
i
had
supposed
them
to
be
of
such
infinitely
high
frequency
that
they
could
be
of
no
practical
use
whatever
i
have
been
trying
for
years
to
learn
something
of
their
nature
but
beyond
working
out
a
method
for
their
detection
and
a
method
of
possible
analysis
that
may
or
may
not
succeed
i
can
do
nothing
with
them
it
is
perfectly
evident
however
that
they
lie
below
the
level
of
the
ether
and
therefore
have
a
velocity
of
propagation
infinitely
greater
than
that
of
light
you
may
see
for
yourself
then
that
to
a
science
able
to
guide
and
control
them
to
make
them
act
as
carrier
waves
for
any
other
desired
frequency
to
do
all
of
which
the
overlord
has
this
day
shown
himself
capable
they
should
theoretically
afford
weapons
before
which
our
every
defense
would
be
precisely
as
efficacious
as
so
much
vacuum
think
a
moment
you
know
that
we
know
nothing
fundamental
concerning
even
our
servants
the
if
we
really
knew
them
we
could
utilize
them
in
thousands
of
ways
as
yet
unknown
to
us
we
work
with
the
merest
handful
of
forces
empirically
while
it
is
practically
certain
that
the
enemy
has
at
his
command
the
entire
spectrum
visible
and
invisible
embracing
untold
thousands
of
bands
of
unknown
but
terrific
potentiality
but
he
spoke
of
a
calculated
time
necessary
before
our
answer
could
be
received
they
must
then
be
using
vibrations
in
the
ether
not
necessarily
not
even
probably
would
we
ourselves
reveal
unnecessarily
to
an
enemy
the
possession
of
such
rays
do
not
be
childish
no
fenimol
and
you
fenor
of
the
fenachrone
instant
and
headlong
flight
is
our
only
hope
of
present
salvation
and
of
ultimate
triumph
flight
to
a
far
distant
galaxy
since
upon
no
point
in
this
one
shall
we
be
safe
from
the
of
that
overlord
you
snivelling
coward
you
pusillanimous
bookworm
fenor
had
regained
his
customary
spirit
as
the
scientist
explained
upon
what
grounds
his
fears
were
based
upon
such
a
tenuous
fabric
of
evidence
would
you
have
such
a
people
as
ours
turn
tail
like
beaten
hounds
because
forsooth
you
detect
a
peculiar
vibration
in
the
air
will
you
have
it
that
we
are
to
be
invaded
and
destroyed
forthwith
by
a
race
of
supernatural
ability
bah
your
clan
has
delayed
the
day
of
conquest
from
year
to
year
i
more
than
half
believe
that
you
yourself
or
some
other
treacherous
poltroon
of
your
ignominious
breed
prepared
and
sent
that
warning
in
a
weak
and
attempt
to
frighten
us
into
again
postponing
the
day
of
conquest
know
now
spineless
weakling
that
the
time
is
ripe
and
that
the
fenachrone
in
their
might
are
about
to
strike
but
you
foul
traducer
of
your
emperor
shall
die
the
death
of
the
cur
you
are
the
hand
within
his
tunic
moved
and
a
vibrator
burst
into
operation
coward
i
may
be
and
pusillanimous
and
other
things
as
well
the
scientist
replied
stonily
but
unlike
you
i
am
not
a
fool
these
walls
this
very
atmosphere
are
fields
of
force
that
will
transmit
no
rays
directed
by
you
you
scion
of
a
depraved
and
obscene
house
arrogant
overbearing
rapacious
ignorant
your
brain
is
too
feeble
to
realize
that
you
are
clutching
at
the
universe
hundreds
of
years
before
the
time
has
come
you
by
your
overweening
pride
and
folly
have
doomed
our
beloved
planet
the
most
perfect
planet
in
the
galaxy
in
its
grateful
warmth
and
wonderful
dampness
and
fogginess
and
our
entire
race
to
certain
destruction
therefore
you
fool
and
dolt
that
you
are
shall
die
for
too
long
already
have
you
ruled
he
flicked
a
finger
and
the
body
of
the
monarch
shuddered
as
though
an
intolerable
current
of
electricity
had
traversed
it
collapsed
and
lay
still
it
was
necessary
to
destroy
this
that
was
our
ruler
ravindau
explained
to
the
general
i
have
long
known
that
you
are
not
in
favor
of
such
precipitate
action
in
the
conquest
hence
all
this
talking
upon
my
part
you
know
that
i
hold
the
honor
of
fenachrone
dear
and
that
all
my
plans
are
for
the
ultimate
triumph
of
our
race
yes
and
i
begin
to
suspect
that
those
plans
have
not
been
made
since
the
warning
was
received
my
plans
have
been
made
for
many
years
and
ever
since
an
immediate
conquest
was
decided
upon
i
have
been
assembling
and
organizing
the
means
to
put
them
into
effect
i
would
have
left
this
planet
in
any
event
shortly
after
the
departure
of
the
grand
fleet
upon
its
final
expedition
fenor
senseless
defiance
of
the
overlord
has
only
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
expedite
my
what
do
you
intend
to
do
i
have
a
vessel
twice
as
large
as
the
largest
warship
fenor
boasted
completely
provisioned
armed
and
powered
for
a
cruise
of
one
hundred
years
at
high
acceleration
it
is
hidden
in
a
remote
fastness
of
the
jungle
i
am
placing
in
that
vessel
a
group
of
the
finest
brainiest
most
highly
advanced
and
intelligent
of
our
men
and
women
with
their
children
we
shall
journey
at
our
highest
speed
to
a
certain
distant
galaxy
where
we
shall
seek
out
a
planet
similar
in
atmosphere
temperature
and
mass
to
the
one
upon
which
we
now
dwell
there
we
shall
multiply
and
continue
our
studies
and
from
that
planet
in
that
day
when
we
shall
have
attained
sufficient
knowledge
there
shall
descend
upon
the
central
system
of
this
galaxy
the
vengeance
of
the
fenachrone
that
vengeance
will
be
all
the
sweeter
for
the
fact
that
it
shall
have
been
delayed
but
how
about
libraries
apparatus
and
equipment
suppose
that
we
do
not
live
long
enough
to
perfect
that
knowledge
and
with
only
one
vessel
and
a
handful
of
men
we
could
not
cope
with
that
accursed
overlord
and
his
navies
of
the
void
libraries
are
aboard
so
are
much
apparatus
and
equipment
what
we
can
not
take
with
us
we
can
build
as
for
the
knowledge
i
mentioned
it
may
not
be
attained
in
your
lifetime
nor
in
mine
but
the
racial
memory
of
the
fenachrone
is
long
as
you
know
and
even
if
the
necessary
problems
are
not
solved
until
our
descendants
are
sufficiently
numerous
to
populate
an
entire
planet
yet
will
those
descendants
wreak
the
vengeance
of
the
fenachrone
upon
the
races
of
that
hated
one
the
overlord
before
they
go
on
with
the
conquest
of
the
universe
many
questions
will
arise
of
course
but
they
shall
be
solved
enough
time
passes
rapidly
and
all
too
long
have
i
talked
i
am
using
this
time
upon
you
because
in
my
organization
there
is
no
soldier
and
the
fenachrone
of
the
future
will
need
your
great
knowledge
of
warfare
are
you
going
with
us
yes
very
well
ravindau
led
the
general
through
a
door
and
into
an
airboat
lying
upon
the
terrace
outside
the
laboratory
drive
us
at
speed
to
your
home
where
we
shall
pick
up
your
family
fenimol
took
the
controls
and
laid
a
ray
to
his
home
a
ray
serving
a
double
purpose
it
held
the
vessel
upon
its
predetermined
course
through
that
thick
and
sticky
fog
and
also
rendered
collision
impossible
since
any
two
of
these
controller
rays
repelled
each
other
to
such
a
degree
that
no
two
vessels
could
take
paths
which
would
bring
them
together
some
such
provision
had
been
found
necessary
ages
ago
for
all
fenachrone
craft
were
provided
with
the
same
drive
to
which
any
comprehensible
distance
was
but
a
journey
of
a
few
moments
and
at
that
frightful
velocity
collision
meant
annihilation
i
understand
that
you
could
not
take
any
one
of
the
military
into
your
confidence
until
you
were
ready
to
put
your
plans
into
effect
the
general
conceded
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
get
ready
to
leave
you
have
said
that
haste
is
imperative
and
i
therefore
assume
that
you
have
already
warned
the
other
members
of
the
expedition
i
flashed
the
emergency
signal
before
i
joined
you
and
fenor
in
the
council
room
each
man
of
the
organization
has
received
that
signal
wherever
he
may
have
been
and
by
this
time
most
of
them
with
their
families
are
on
the
way
to
the
hidden
cruiser
we
shall
leave
this
planet
in
fifteen
minutes
from
now
at
most
i
dare
not
stay
an
instant
longer
than
is
absolutely
necessary
the
members
of
the
general
family
were
bundled
amazed
into
the
airboat
which
immediately
flew
along
a
ray
laid
by
ravindau
to
the
secret
rendezvous
in
a
remote
and
desolate
part
of
the
planet
concealed
in
the
depths
of
the
towering
jungle
growth
a
mammoth
was
receiving
her
complement
of
passengers
airboats
flying
at
their
terrific
velocity
through
the
heavy
steaming
fog
as
as
their
controller
rays
would
permit
flashed
signals
along
their
guiding
beams
dove
into
the
apparently
impenetrable
jungle
and
added
their
passengers
to
the
throng
pouring
into
the
great
vessel
as
the
minute
of
departure
drew
near
the
feeling
of
tension
aboard
the
cruiser
increased
and
vigilance
was
raised
to
the
maximum
none
of
the
passengers
had
been
allowed
senders
of
any
description
and
now
even
the
beams
guiding
the
airboats
were
cut
off
and
received
only
when
the
proper
code
signal
was
heard
the
doors
were
shut
no
one
was
allowed
outside
and
everything
was
held
in
readiness
for
instant
flight
at
the
least
alarm
finally
a
scientist
and
his
family
arrived
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
planet
the
last
members
of
the
organization
and
minutes
after
ravindau
had
flashed
his
signal
the
prow
of
that
mighty
reared
toward
the
perpendicular
poising
its
massive
length
at
the
predetermined
angle
there
it
halted
momentarily
then
disappeared
utterly
only
a
vast
column
of
tortured
and
shattered
vegetation
torn
from
the
ground
and
carried
for
miles
upward
into
the
air
by
the
vacuum
of
its
wake
remaining
to
indicate
the
path
taken
by
the
flying
projectile
hour
after
hour
the
fenachrone
vessel
bored
on
with
its
frightful
and
velocity
through
the
stars
but
it
was
not
until
the
last
star
had
been
passed
until
everything
before
them
was
entirely
devoid
of
light
and
until
the
galaxy
behind
them
began
to
take
on
a
lenticular
aspect
that
ravindau
would
consent
to
leave
the
controls
and
to
seek
his
rest
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
went
by
and
the
fenachrone
vessel
still
held
the
rate
of
motion
with
which
she
had
started
out
ravindau
and
fenimol
sat
in
the
control
cabin
staring
out
through
the
visiplates
abstracted
there
was
no
need
of
staring
and
they
were
not
really
looking
for
there
was
nothing
at
which
to
look
outside
the
transparent
metal
hull
of
that
monster
of
the
trackless
void
there
was
nothing
visible
the
galaxy
of
which
our
earth
is
an
infinitesimal
mote
the
galaxy
which
former
astronomers
considered
the
universe
was
so
far
behind
that
its
immeasurable
diameter
was
too
small
to
affect
the
vision
of
the
unaided
eye
other
galaxies
lay
at
even
greater
distances
away
on
either
side
the
galaxy
toward
which
they
were
making
their
stupendous
flight
was
as
yet
untold
millions
of
distant
nothing
was
visible
before
their
gaze
stretched
an
infinity
of
emptiness
no
stars
no
nebulæ
no
meteoric
matter
nor
even
the
smallest
particle
of
cosmic
dust
absolutely
empty
space
absolute
vacuum
and
absolute
zero
absolute
nothingness
a
concept
intrinsically
impossible
for
the
most
highly
trained
human
mind
to
grasp
conscienceless
and
heartless
monstrosities
though
they
both
were
by
heredity
and
training
the
immensity
of
the
appalling
lack
of
anything
tangible
oppressed
them
ravindau
was
stern
and
serious
fenimol
moody
finally
the
latter
spoke
it
would
be
endurable
if
we
knew
what
had
happened
or
if
we
ever
could
know
definitely
one
way
or
the
other
whether
all
this
was
necessary
we
shall
know
general
definitely
i
am
certain
in
my
own
mind
but
after
a
time
when
we
have
settled
upon
our
new
home
and
when
the
overlord
shall
have
relaxed
his
vigilance
you
shall
come
back
to
the
solar
system
of
the
fenachrone
in
this
vessel
or
a
similar
one
i
know
what
you
shall
find
but
the
trip
shall
be
made
and
you
shall
yourself
see
what
was
once
our
home
planet
a
seething
sun
second
only
in
brilliance
to
the
parent
sun
about
which
she
shall
still
be
revolving
are
we
safe
even
now
what
of
possible
pursuit
asked
fenimol
and
the
monstrous
wells
of
black
that
were
ravindau
eyes
almost
emitted
tangible
fires
as
he
made
reply
we
are
far
from
safe
but
we
grow
stronger
minute
by
minute
fifty
of
the
greatest
minds
our
world
has
ever
known
have
been
working
from
the
moment
of
our
departure
upon
a
line
of
investigation
suggested
to
me
by
certain
things
my
instruments
recorded
during
the
visit
of
the
overlord
i
can
not
say
anything
yet
even
to
you
except
that
the
day
of
conquest
may
not
be
so
far
in
the
future
as
we
have
supposed
chapter
xiv
interstellar
extermination
i
hate
to
leave
this
meeting
it
great
stuff
remarked
seaton
as
he
flashed
down
to
the
torpedo
room
at
fenor
command
to
send
recall
messages
to
all
outlying
vessels
but
this
machine
is
designed
to
let
me
be
in
more
than
two
places
at
once
wish
it
were
maybe
after
this
fracas
is
over
we
be
able
to
incorporate
something
like
that
into
it
the
chief
operator
touched
a
lever
and
the
chair
upon
which
he
sat
with
all
its
control
panels
slid
rapidly
across
the
floor
toward
an
apparently
blank
wall
as
he
reached
it
a
port
opened
a
metal
scroll
appeared
containing
the
numbers
and
last
reported
positions
of
all
fenachrone
vessels
outside
the
detector
zone
and
a
vast
magazine
of
torpedoes
came
up
through
the
floor
with
an
automatic
loader
to
place
a
torpedo
under
the
operator
hand
the
instant
its
predecessor
had
been
launched
get
peg
here
quick
mart
we
need
a
stenographer
till
she
gets
here
see
what
you
can
do
in
getting
those
first
numbers
before
they
roll
off
the
end
of
the
scroll
no
hold
it
as
you
were
i
got
controls
enough
to
put
the
whole
thing
on
a
recorder
so
we
can
study
it
at
our
leisure
haste
was
indeed
necessary
for
the
operator
worked
with
uncanny
quickness
of
hand
one
fleeting
glance
at
the
scroll
a
lightning
adjustment
of
dials
in
the
torpedo
a
touch
upon
a
tiny
button
and
a
messenger
was
upon
its
way
but
quick
as
he
was
seaton
flying
fingers
kept
up
with
him
and
before
each
torpedo
disappeared
through
the
ether
gate
there
was
fastened
upon
it
a
tracer
ray
that
would
never
leave
it
until
the
force
had
been
disconnected
at
the
gigantic
control
board
of
the
norlaminian
projector
one
flying
minute
passed
during
which
seventy
torpedoes
had
been
launched
before
seaton
spoke
wonder
how
many
ships
they
got
out
anyway
did
get
any
idea
from
the
anyway
rovol
it
might
be
a
sound
idea
for
you
to
install
me
some
more
tracer
rays
on
this
board
i
got
only
a
couple
of
hundred
and
that
may
not
be
enough
and
i
got
both
hands
full
rovol
seated
himself
beside
the
younger
man
like
one
organist
joining
another
at
the
console
of
a
tremendous
organ
seaton
nimble
fingers
would
flash
here
and
there
depressing
keys
and
manipulating
controls
until
he
had
exactly
the
required
combination
of
forces
centered
upon
the
torpedo
next
to
issue
he
then
would
press
a
tiny
switch
and
upon
a
panel
full
of
numbered
plungers
the
one
next
in
series
would
drive
home
transferring
to
itself
the
assembled
beam
and
releasing
the
keys
for
the
assembly
of
other
forces
rovol
fingers
were
also
flying
but
the
forces
he
directed
were
seizing
and
shaping
material
as
well
as
other
forces
the
norlaminian
physicist
set
up
one
integral
stepped
upon
a
pedal
and
a
new
stop
precisely
like
the
others
and
numbered
in
order
appeared
as
though
by
magic
upon
the
panel
at
seaton
left
hand
rovol
then
leaned
back
in
his
seat
but
the
stops
continued
to
appear
at
the
rate
of
exactly
seventy
per
minute
upon
the
panel
which
increased
in
width
sufficiently
to
accommodate
another
row
as
soon
as
a
row
was
completed
rovol
bent
a
quizzical
glance
upon
the
younger
scientist
who
blushed
a
fiery
red
rapidly
set
up
another
integral
then
also
leaned
back
in
his
place
while
his
face
burned
deeper
than
before
that
is
better
son
never
forget
that
it
is
a
waste
of
energy
to
do
the
same
thing
twice
with
your
hands
and
that
if
you
know
precisely
what
is
to
be
done
you
need
not
do
it
with
your
hands
at
all
forces
are
tireless
and
they
neither
slip
nor
make
mistakes
thanks
rovol
i
bet
this
lesson
will
make
it
stick
in
my
mind
too
you
are
not
thoroughly
accustomed
to
using
all
your
knowledge
as
yet
that
will
come
with
practice
however
and
in
a
few
weeks
you
will
be
as
thoroughly
at
home
with
forces
as
i
am
hope
so
chief
but
it
looks
like
a
tall
order
to
me
finally
the
last
torpedo
was
dispatched
the
tube
closed
and
seaton
moved
the
projection
back
up
into
the
council
chamber
finding
it
empty
well
the
conference
is
over
besides
we
got
more
important
fish
to
fry
war
has
been
declared
on
both
sides
and
we
got
to
get
busy
they
got
nine
hundred
and
six
vessels
out
and
every
one
of
them
has
got
to
go
to
davy
jones
locker
before
we
can
sleep
sound
of
nights
my
first
job
have
to
be
untangling
those
nine
oh
six
forces
getting
lines
on
each
one
of
them
and
seeing
if
i
can
project
straight
enough
to
find
the
ships
before
the
torpedoes
overtake
them
mart
you
and
orlon
the
astronomer
had
better
dope
out
the
last
reported
positions
of
each
of
those
vessels
so
we
know
about
where
to
hunt
for
them
rovol
you
might
send
out
a
detector
screen
a
few
light
years
in
diameter
to
be
sure
none
of
them
slips
a
fast
one
over
on
us
by
starting
it
right
here
and
expanding
it
gradually
you
can
be
sure
that
no
fenachrone
is
inside
it
then
we
find
a
hunk
of
copper
on
that
planet
somewhere
plate
it
with
some
of
their
own
metal
and
blow
them
into
kingdom
come
may
i
venture
a
suggestion
asked
drasnik
the
first
of
psychology
absolutely
nothing
you
said
so
far
has
been
idle
chatter
you
know
of
course
that
there
are
real
scientists
among
the
fenachrone
and
you
yourself
have
suggested
that
while
they
can
not
penetrate
the
zone
of
force
nor
use
rays
yet
they
might
know
about
them
in
theory
might
even
be
able
to
know
when
they
were
being
used
detect
them
in
other
words
let
us
assume
that
such
a
scientist
did
detect
your
rays
while
you
were
there
a
short
time
ago
what
would
he
do
search
me
i
bite
what
would
he
do
he
might
do
any
one
of
several
things
but
if
i
read
their
nature
aright
such
a
one
would
gather
up
a
few
men
and
women
as
many
as
he
could
and
migrate
to
another
planet
for
he
would
of
course
grasp
instantly
the
fact
that
you
had
used
rays
as
carrier
waves
and
would
be
able
to
deduce
your
ability
to
destroy
he
would
also
realize
that
in
the
brief
time
allowed
him
he
could
not
hope
to
learn
to
control
those
unknown
forces
and
with
his
terribly
savage
and
vengeful
nature
and
intense
pride
of
race
he
would
take
every
possible
step
both
to
perpetuate
his
race
and
to
obtain
revenge
am
i
right
seaton
swung
to
his
controls
savagely
and
manipulated
dials
and
keys
rapidly
right
as
rain
drasnik
there
i
thrown
around
them
a
detector
screen
that
they
ca
possibly
neutralize
anything
that
goes
out
through
it
will
have
a
tracer
slapped
onto
it
but
say
it
been
half
an
hour
since
war
was
declared
suppose
we
too
late
maybe
some
of
them
have
got
away
already
and
if
one
couple
of
has
beat
us
to
it
we
have
the
whole
thing
to
do
over
again
a
thousand
years
or
so
from
now
you
got
the
massive
intellect
drasnik
what
can
we
do
about
it
we
ca
throw
a
detector
screen
all
over
the
galaxy
i
would
suggest
that
since
you
have
now
guarded
against
further
exodus
it
is
necessary
to
destroy
the
planet
for
a
time
rovol
and
his
have
the
other
projector
nearly
done
let
them
project
me
to
the
world
of
the
fenachrone
where
i
shall
conduct
a
thorough
mental
investigation
by
the
time
you
have
taken
care
of
the
raiding
vessels
i
believe
that
i
shall
have
been
able
to
learn
everything
we
need
to
know
fine
hop
to
it
and
may
there
be
lots
of
bubbles
in
your
anybody
else
know
of
any
other
i
left
open
no
other
suggestions
were
made
and
each
man
bent
to
his
particular
task
crane
at
the
of
the
galaxy
and
orlon
at
the
fenachrone
operator
dispatching
scroll
rapidly
worked
out
the
approximate
positions
of
the
fenachrone
vessels
and
marked
them
with
tiny
green
lights
in
a
vast
model
of
the
galaxy
which
they
had
already
caused
forces
to
erect
in
the
air
of
the
projector
base
it
was
soon
learned
that
a
few
of
the
ships
were
exploring
quite
close
to
their
home
system
so
close
that
the
torpedoes
with
their
unthinkable
acceleration
would
reach
them
within
a
few
hours
ascertaining
the
of
the
tracer
ray
upon
the
torpedo
which
should
first
reach
its
destination
seaton
followed
it
from
the
stop
upon
his
panel
out
to
the
flying
messenger
now
moving
with
a
velocity
many
times
that
of
light
it
was
of
course
invisible
to
direct
vision
but
to
the
light
waves
heterodyned
upon
the
projector
rays
it
was
as
plainly
visible
as
though
it
were
stationary
lining
up
the
path
of
the
projectile
accurately
he
then
projected
himself
forward
in
that
exact
line
with
a
flat
thrown
out
for
half
a
light
year
upon
each
side
of
him
setting
the
controls
he
flashed
ahead
the
detector
stopping
him
the
instant
that
the
invisible
barrier
encountered
the
of
the
exploring
raider
an
oscillator
sounded
a
shrill
and
rising
note
and
seaton
slowly
shifted
his
controls
until
he
stood
in
the
control
room
of
the
enemy
vessel
the
fenachrone
ship
a
thousand
feet
long
and
more
than
a
hundred
feet
in
diameter
was
tearing
through
space
toward
a
brilliant
star
her
crew
were
at
battle
stations
her
navigating
officers
peering
intently
into
the
operating
visiplates
all
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
a
stranger
stood
in
their
very
midst
well
here
the
first
one
gang
said
seaton
i
hate
like
sin
to
do
this
it
altogether
too
much
like
pushing
baby
chickens
into
a
creek
to
suit
me
but
it
a
dirty
job
that
got
to
be
done
as
one
man
orlon
and
the
other
remaining
norlaminians
leaped
out
of
the
projector
and
floated
to
the
ground
below
i
expected
that
remarked
seaton
they
ca
even
think
of
a
thing
like
this
without
getting
the
blue
willies
i
do
blame
them
much
at
that
how
about
you
carfon
you
can
be
excused
if
you
like
i
want
to
watch
those
forces
at
work
i
do
not
enjoy
destruction
but
like
you
i
can
make
myself
endure
it
dunark
the
fierce
and
bloodthirsty
osnomian
prince
leaped
to
his
feet
his
eyes
flashing
that
one
thing
i
never
could
get
about
you
dick
he
exclaimed
in
english
how
a
man
with
your
brains
can
be
so
soft
so
sloppily
sentimental
gets
clear
past
me
you
remind
me
of
a
bowl
of
mush
you
wade
around
in
slush
clear
to
your
ears
faugh
it
their
lives
or
ours
tell
me
what
button
to
push
and
i
be
only
too
glad
to
push
it
i
wanted
to
blow
up
urvania
and
you
would
let
me
i
have
killed
an
enemy
for
ages
and
that
my
trade
cut
out
the
act
and
for
cat
sake
let
get
busy
dunark
that
tellin
but
it
all
right
with
me
be
glad
to
let
you
do
it
when
i
say
throw
in
that
plunger
there
number
seaton
manipulated
controls
until
two
electrodes
of
force
were
clamped
in
place
one
at
either
end
of
the
huge
of
the
enemy
vessel
adjusted
rheostats
and
forces
to
send
a
disintegrating
current
through
that
massive
copper
cylinder
and
gave
the
word
dunark
threw
in
the
switch
with
a
vicious
thrust
as
though
it
were
an
actual
sword
which
he
was
thrusting
through
the
vitals
of
one
of
the
awesome
crew
and
the
very
universe
exploded
around
them
exploded
into
one
mad
searing
coruscation
of
blinding
dazzling
light
as
the
gigantic
cylinder
of
copper
resolved
itself
instantaneously
into
the
pure
energy
from
which
its
metal
originally
had
come
into
being
seaton
and
dunark
staggered
back
from
the
visiplates
blinded
by
the
intolerable
glare
of
light
and
even
crane
working
at
his
model
of
the
galaxy
blinked
at
the
intensity
of
the
radiation
many
minutes
passed
before
the
two
men
could
see
through
their
tortured
eyes
zowie
that
was
fierce
exclaimed
seaton
when
a
perception
of
things
other
than
dizzy
spirals
and
balls
of
flame
assured
him
that
his
eyesight
was
not
permanently
gone
it
nothing
but
my
own
fool
carelessness
too
i
should
have
known
that
with
all
the
light
frequencies
in
heterodyne
for
visibility
enough
of
that
same
stuff
would
leak
through
to
make
strong
medicine
on
these
visiplates
for
i
knew
that
that
bar
weighed
a
hundred
tons
and
would
liberate
energy
enough
to
volatilize
our
earth
and
blow
the
clear
to
arcturus
how
you
coming
dunark
see
anything
yet
coming
along
now
i
guess
but
i
thought
for
a
few
minutes
been
bloody
well
jobbed
i
do
better
next
time
i
cut
out
the
visible
spectrum
before
the
flash
and
convert
and
reconvert
the
that
let
us
see
what
happens
without
the
direct
effect
of
the
glare
wo
burn
our
eyes
out
what
my
force
number
on
the
next
nearest
one
mart
seaton
fastened
a
detector
ray
upon
stop
of
the
panel
and
followed
its
beam
of
force
out
to
the
torpedo
hastening
upon
its
way
toward
the
next
doomed
cruiser
flashing
ahead
in
its
line
as
he
had
done
before
he
located
the
vessel
and
clamped
the
electrodes
of
force
upon
the
prodigious
driving
bar
again
as
dunark
drove
home
the
detonating
switch
there
was
a
frightful
explosion
and
a
wild
glare
of
frenzied
incandescence
far
out
in
that
desolate
region
of
interstellar
space
but
this
time
the
eyes
behind
the
visiplates
were
not
torn
by
the
high
frequencies
everything
that
happened
was
plainly
visible
one
instant
there
was
an
immense
boring
on
through
the
void
upon
its
horrid
mission
with
its
full
complement
of
the
hellish
fenachrone
performing
their
routine
tasks
the
next
instant
there
was
a
flash
of
light
extending
for
thousands
upon
untold
thousands
of
miles
in
every
direction
that
flare
of
light
vanished
as
rapidly
as
it
had
appeared
instantaneously
and
throughout
the
entire
neighborhood
of
the
place
where
the
fenachrone
cruiser
had
been
there
was
nothing
not
a
plate
nor
a
girder
not
a
fragment
not
the
most
minute
particle
nor
droplet
of
disrupted
metal
nor
of
condensed
vapor
so
terrific
so
incredibly
and
incomprehensibly
vast
were
the
forces
liberated
by
that
mass
of
copper
in
its
instantaneous
decomposition
that
every
atom
of
substance
in
that
great
vessel
had
gone
with
the
had
been
resolved
into
radiations
which
would
at
some
distant
time
and
in
some
solitude
unite
with
other
radiations
again
to
form
matter
and
thus
obey
nature
immutable
cyclic
law
thus
vessel
after
vessel
was
destroyed
of
that
haughty
fleet
which
until
now
had
never
suffered
a
reverse
and
a
little
green
light
in
the
galactic
model
winked
out
and
flashed
back
in
rosy
pink
as
each
menace
was
removed
in
a
few
hours
the
space
surrounding
the
system
of
the
fenachrone
was
clear
then
progress
slackened
as
it
became
harder
and
harder
to
locate
each
vessel
as
the
distance
between
it
and
its
torpedo
increased
time
after
time
seaton
would
stab
forward
with
his
detector
screen
extended
to
its
utmost
possible
spread
upon
the
most
carefully
plotted
prolongation
of
the
line
of
the
torpedo
flight
only
to
have
the
projection
flash
far
beyond
the
vessel
furthest
possible
position
without
a
reaction
from
the
screen
then
he
would
go
back
to
the
torpedo
make
a
minute
alteration
in
his
line
and
again
flash
forward
only
to
miss
it
again
finally
after
thirty
fruitless
attempts
to
bring
his
detector
screen
into
contact
with
the
nearest
fenachrone
ship
he
gave
up
the
attempt
rammed
his
battered
reeking
briar
full
of
the
rank
blend
that
was
his
favorite
smoke
and
strode
up
and
down
the
floor
of
the
projector
base
his
eyes
unseeing
his
hands
jammed
deep
into
his
pockets
his
jaw
thrust
forward
clamped
upon
the
stem
of
his
pipe
emitting
dense
blue
clouds
of
strangling
vapor
the
maestro
is
thinking
i
perceive
remarked
dorothy
sweetly
entering
the
projector
from
an
airboat
you
must
all
be
blind
i
guess
you
no
hear
the
bell
blow
what
i
come
after
you
it
time
to
eat
dot
never
miss
the
eats
thanks
and
seaton
put
his
problem
away
with
perceptible
effort
this
is
going
to
be
a
job
mart
he
went
back
to
it
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
in
the
airboat
flying
toward
home
i
can
nail
them
with
an
increasing
shift
in
azimuth
up
to
about
thirty
thousand
but
after
that
it
gets
awfully
hard
to
get
the
right
shift
and
up
around
a
hundred
thousand
it
seems
to
be
darn
near
impossible
gets
to
be
pure
guesswork
it
ca
be
the
controls
because
they
can
hold
a
point
rigidly
at
five
hundred
thousand
of
course
we
got
a
pretty
short
to
sight
on
but
the
shift
is
more
than
a
hundred
times
as
great
as
the
possible
error
in
backsight
could
account
for
and
there
apparently
nothing
either
regular
or
systematic
about
it
that
i
can
figure
out
but
i
do
know
space
is
curved
in
the
fourth
dimension
of
course
i
wonder
if
hm
m
he
fell
silent
and
crane
made
a
rapid
signal
to
dorothy
who
was
opening
her
mouth
to
say
something
she
shut
it
feeling
ridiculous
and
nothing
was
said
until
they
had
disembarked
at
their
destination
did
you
solve
the
puzzle
dickie
do
think
so
got
myself
in
deeper
than
ever
i
afraid
he
answered
then
went
on
thinking
aloud
rather
than
addressing
any
one
in
particular
space
is
curved
in
the
fourth
dimension
and
rays
with
their
velocity
may
not
follow
the
same
path
in
that
dimension
that
light
does
in
fact
they
do
not
if
that
path
is
to
be
plotted
it
requires
the
solution
of
five
simultaneous
equations
each
complete
and
general
and
each
of
the
fifth
degree
and
also
an
exponential
series
with
the
unknown
in
the
final
exponent
before
the
concept
can
be
derived
hm
m
no
use
we
struck
something
that
not
even
norlaminian
theory
can
handle
you
surprise
me
crane
said
i
supposed
that
they
had
everything
worked
out
not
on
stuff
it
new
you
know
it
begins
to
look
as
though
we
have
to
stick
around
until
every
one
of
those
torpedoes
gets
somewhere
near
its
hate
to
do
it
too
it
take
six
months
at
least
to
reach
the
vessels
clear
across
the
galaxy
i
put
it
up
to
the
gang
at
dinner
guess
they
let
me
talk
business
a
couple
of
minutes
overtime
especially
after
they
find
out
what
i
got
to
say
he
explained
the
phenomenon
to
an
interested
group
of
scientists
as
they
ate
rovol
to
seaton
surprise
was
elated
and
enthusiastic
wonderful
my
boy
he
breathed
marvelous
a
perfect
subject
for
years
after
year
of
deepest
study
and
the
most
profound
thought
perfect
but
what
can
we
about
it
asked
seaton
exasperated
we
want
to
hang
around
here
twiddling
our
thumbs
for
a
year
waiting
for
those
torpedoes
to
get
to
wherever
they
going
we
can
do
nothing
but
wait
and
study
that
problem
is
one
of
splendid
difficulty
as
you
yourself
realize
its
solution
may
well
be
a
matter
of
lifetimes
instead
of
years
but
what
is
a
year
more
or
less
you
can
destroy
the
fenachrone
eventually
so
be
content
but
content
is
just
exactly
what
i
declared
seaton
emphatically
i
want
to
do
it
and
do
it
perhaps
i
might
volunteer
a
suggestion
said
caslor
diffidently
and
as
both
rovol
and
seaton
looked
at
him
in
surprise
he
went
on
do
not
misunderstand
me
i
do
not
mean
concerning
the
mathematical
problem
in
discussion
about
which
i
am
entirely
ignorant
but
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
those
torpedoes
are
not
intelligent
entities
acting
upon
their
own
volition
and
steering
themselves
as
a
result
of
their
own
ordered
mental
processes
no
they
are
mechanisms
in
my
own
province
and
i
venture
to
say
with
the
utmost
confidence
that
they
are
guided
to
their
destinations
by
streamers
of
force
of
some
nature
emanating
from
the
vessels
upon
whose
tracks
they
are
holme
is
right
exclaimed
seaton
tapping
his
temple
with
an
admonitory
forefinger
ace
i
thought
maybe
i
quit
using
my
head
for
nothing
but
a
hatrack
now
but
i
guess
that
all
it
good
for
yet
thanks
a
lot
for
the
idea
that
gives
me
something
i
can
get
my
teeth
into
and
now
that
rovol
got
a
problem
to
work
on
for
the
next
century
or
so
everybody
happy
how
does
that
help
matters
asked
crane
in
wonder
of
course
it
is
not
surprising
that
no
lines
of
force
were
visible
but
i
thought
that
your
detectors
screens
would
have
found
them
if
any
such
guiding
beams
had
been
present
the
ordinary
bands
if
of
sufficient
power
yes
but
there
are
many
possible
tracer
rays
not
reactive
to
a
screen
such
as
i
was
using
it
was
very
light
and
weak
designed
for
terrific
velocity
and
for
instantaneous
automatic
arrest
when
in
contact
with
the
enormous
forces
of
a
power
bar
it
would
react
at
all
to
the
minute
energy
of
the
kind
of
beams
they
be
most
likely
to
use
for
that
work
caslor
certainly
right
they
steering
their
torpedoes
with
tracer
rays
of
almost
infinitesimal
power
amplified
in
the
torpedoes
themselves
that
the
way
i
do
it
myself
it
may
take
a
little
while
to
rig
up
the
apparatus
but
we
get
it
and
then
we
run
those
birds
ragged
so
fast
that
their
ankles
catch
fire
and
wo
need
the
correction
after
all
when
the
bell
announced
the
beginning
of
the
following
period
of
labor
seaton
and
his
were
in
the
area
of
experiment
waiting
and
the
work
was
soon
under
way
how
are
you
going
about
this
dick
asked
crane
going
to
examine
the
nose
of
one
of
those
torpedoes
first
and
see
what
it
actually
works
on
then
build
me
a
tracer
detector
that
pick
it
up
at
high
velocity
beats
the
band
does
it
that
neither
rovol
nor
i
who
should
have
thought
of
it
first
ever
did
see
anything
as
plain
as
that
that
those
things
are
following
a
ray
that
is
easily
explained
and
is
no
more
than
natural
both
of
you
were
not
only
devoting
all
your
thoughts
to
the
curvature
of
space
but
were
also
too
close
to
the
problem
like
the
man
in
the
woods
who
can
not
see
the
forest
because
of
the
trees
yeah
may
be
something
in
that
too
plain
enough
when
caslor
showed
it
to
us
said
seaton
while
he
was
talking
seaton
had
projected
himself
into
the
torpedo
he
had
lined
up
so
many
times
the
previous
day
with
the
automatic
motions
set
to
hold
him
stationary
in
the
tiny
instrument
compartment
of
the
craft
now
traveling
at
a
velocity
many
times
that
of
light
he
set
to
work
a
glance
located
the
detector
mechanism
a
set
of
coils
and
amplifiers
and
a
brief
study
made
plain
to
him
the
principles
underlying
the
directional
loop
finders
and
the
controls
which
guided
the
flying
shell
along
the
path
of
the
tracer
ray
he
then
built
a
detector
structure
of
pure
force
immediately
in
front
of
the
torpedo
and
varied
the
frequency
of
his
own
apparatus
until
a
meter
upon
one
of
the
panels
before
his
eyes
informed
him
that
his
detector
was
in
perfect
resonance
with
the
frequency
of
the
tracer
ray
he
then
moved
ahead
of
the
torpedo
along
the
guiding
ray
guiding
it
eh
dunark
congratulated
him
kinda
my
directors
out
there
are
quite
so
hot
though
i
a
trifle
shy
on
control
somewhere
so
much
so
that
if
i
put
on
anywhere
near
full
velocity
i
lose
the
ray
think
i
can
clear
that
up
with
a
little
experimenting
though
he
fingered
controls
lightly
depressed
a
few
more
keys
and
set
one
vernier
already
at
a
ratio
of
a
million
to
one
down
to
ten
million
he
then
stepped
up
his
velocity
and
found
that
the
guides
worked
well
up
to
a
speed
much
greater
than
any
ever
reached
by
fenachrone
vessels
or
torpedoes
but
failed
utterly
to
hold
the
ray
at
anything
approaching
the
full
velocity
possible
to
his
projector
after
hours
and
days
of
work
and
study
in
the
course
of
which
hundreds
of
the
fenachrone
vessels
were
destroyed
after
employing
all
the
resources
of
his
mind
now
stored
with
the
knowledge
of
rays
accumulated
by
hundreds
of
generations
of
research
specialists
in
rays
he
became
convinced
that
it
was
an
inherent
impossibility
to
trace
any
ether
wave
with
the
velocity
he
desired
ca
be
done
i
guess
mart
he
confessed
ruefully
you
see
it
works
fine
up
to
a
certain
point
but
beyond
that
nothing
doing
just
found
out
why
and
in
so
doing
i
think
i
made
a
contribution
to
science
at
velocities
well
below
that
of
light
are
shifted
a
minute
amount
you
know
at
the
velocity
of
light
and
up
to
a
velocity
not
even
approached
by
the
fenachrone
vessels
on
their
longest
trips
the
distortion
is
still
not
serious
no
matter
how
fast
we
want
to
travel
in
the
i
think
i
can
guarantee
that
we
will
still
be
able
to
see
things
that
is
to
be
expected
from
the
idea
that
the
apparent
velocity
of
any
ether
vibration
is
independent
of
the
velocity
of
either
source
or
receiver
however
that
relationship
fails
at
velocities
far
below
that
of
rays
at
only
a
very
small
fraction
of
that
speed
the
tracers
i
am
following
are
so
badly
distorted
that
they
disappear
altogether
and
i
have
to
distort
them
backwards
that
would
be
too
bad
but
when
i
get
up
to
about
one
per
cent
of
the
velocity
i
want
to
use
i
ca
calculate
a
force
that
will
operate
to
distort
them
back
into
recognizable
that
another
problem
for
rovol
to
chew
on
for
another
hundred
years
that
will
of
course
slow
up
the
work
of
clearing
the
galaxy
of
the
fenachrone
but
at
the
same
time
i
see
nothing
about
which
to
be
alarmed
crane
replied
you
are
working
very
much
faster
than
you
could
have
done
by
waiting
for
the
torpedoes
to
arrive
the
present
condition
is
very
satisfactory
i
should
say
and
he
waved
his
hand
at
the
galactic
model
in
nearly
of
whose
volume
the
green
lights
had
been
replaced
by
pink
ones
yeah
pretty
fair
as
far
as
that
goes
we
clean
up
in
ten
days
or
so
but
i
hate
to
be
licked
well
i
might
as
well
quit
sobbing
and
get
busy
in
due
time
the
nine
hundred
and
sixth
fenachrone
vessel
was
checked
off
on
the
model
and
the
two
terrestrials
went
in
search
of
drasnik
whom
they
found
in
his
study
summing
up
and
analyzing
a
mass
of
data
facts
and
ideas
which
were
being
projected
in
the
air
around
him
well
our
first
job
done
seaton
stated
what
do
you
know
that
you
feel
like
passing
around
my
investigation
is
practically
complete
replied
the
first
of
psychology
gravely
i
have
explored
many
fenachrone
minds
and
without
exception
i
have
found
them
chambers
of
horror
of
a
kind
unimaginable
to
one
of
us
however
you
are
not
interested
in
their
psychology
but
in
facts
bearing
upon
your
problem
while
such
facts
were
scarce
i
did
discover
a
few
interesting
items
i
spied
upon
them
in
public
and
in
their
most
private
haunts
i
analyzed
them
individually
and
collectively
and
from
the
few
known
facts
and
from
the
great
deal
of
guesswork
and
conjecture
there
available
to
me
i
have
formulated
a
theory
i
shall
first
give
you
the
known
facts
their
scientists
can
not
direct
nor
control
any
ray
not
propagated
through
ether
but
they
can
detect
one
such
frequency
or
band
of
frequencies
which
they
call
and
which
are
probably
the
rays
since
they
lie
in
the
first
level
below
the
ether
the
detector
proper
is
a
type
of
lamp
which
gives
a
blue
light
at
the
ordinary
intensity
of
such
rays
as
would
come
from
space
or
from
an
ordinary
power
plant
but
gives
a
red
light
under
strong
excitation
i
get
that
said
seaton
had
i
know
all
about
seaton
encouraged
drasnik
who
had
paused
with
a
questioning
glance
i
know
exactly
how
and
why
such
a
detector
works
we
gave
an
alarm
all
right
even
though
we
were
working
on
a
tight
beam
from
here
to
there
our
secondary
projector
there
was
radiating
enough
to
affect
every
such
detector
within
a
thousand
miles
drasnik
continued
another
significant
fact
is
that
a
great
many
persons
i
learned
of
some
five
hundred
and
there
were
probably
many
more
have
disappeared
without
explanation
and
without
leaving
a
trace
and
it
seems
that
they
disappeared
very
shortly
after
our
communication
was
delivered
one
of
these
was
fenor
the
emperor
his
family
remain
however
and
his
son
is
not
only
ruling
in
his
stead
but
is
carrying
out
his
father
policies
the
other
disappearances
are
all
alike
and
are
peculiar
in
certain
respects
first
every
man
who
vanished
belonged
to
the
party
of
postponement
the
minority
party
of
the
fenachrone
who
believe
that
the
time
for
the
conquest
has
not
yet
come
second
every
one
of
them
was
a
leader
in
thought
in
some
field
of
usefulness
and
every
such
field
is
represented
by
at
least
one
disappearance
even
the
army
as
general
fenimol
the
and
his
whole
family
are
among
the
absentees
third
and
most
remarkable
each
such
disappearance
included
an
entire
family
clear
down
to
children
and
however
young
another
fact
is
that
the
fenachrone
department
of
navigation
keeps
a
very
close
check
upon
all
vessels
particularly
vessels
capable
of
navigating
outer
space
every
vessel
built
must
be
registered
and
its
location
is
always
known
from
its
individual
tracer
ray
no
fenachrone
vessel
is
missing
i
also
sifted
a
mass
of
gossip
and
conjecture
some
of
which
may
bear
upon
the
subject
one
belief
is
that
all
the
persons
were
put
to
death
by
fenor
secret
service
and
that
the
emperor
was
assassinated
in
revenge
the
most
widespread
belief
however
is
that
they
have
fled
some
hold
that
they
are
in
hiding
in
some
remote
shelter
in
the
jungle
arguing
that
the
rigid
registration
of
all
vessels
renders
a
journey
of
any
great
length
impossible
and
that
the
detector
screens
would
have
given
warning
of
any
vessel
leaving
the
planet
others
think
that
persons
as
powerful
as
fenimol
and
ravindau
could
have
built
any
vessel
they
chose
with
neither
the
knowledge
nor
consent
of
the
department
of
navigation
or
that
they
could
have
stolen
a
navy
vessel
destroying
its
records
and
that
ravindau
certainly
could
have
so
neutralized
the
screens
that
they
would
have
given
no
alarm
these
believe
that
the
absent
ones
have
migrated
to
some
other
solar
system
or
to
some
other
planet
of
the
same
sun
one
old
general
loudly
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
cowardly
traitors
had
probably
fled
clear
out
of
the
galaxy
and
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
send
the
rest
of
the
party
of
postponement
after
them
there
in
brief
are
the
salient
points
of
my
investigation
in
so
far
as
it
concerns
your
immediate
problem
a
good
many
straws
pointing
this
way
and
that
commented
seaton
however
we
know
that
the
are
just
as
rabid
on
the
idea
of
conquering
the
universe
as
the
others
are
only
they
are
a
lot
more
cautious
and
wo
take
even
a
gambler
chance
of
a
defeat
but
formed
a
theory
what
is
it
drasnik
from
my
analysis
of
these
facts
and
conjectures
in
conjunction
with
certain
purely
psychological
indices
which
we
need
not
take
time
to
go
into
now
i
am
certain
that
they
have
left
their
solar
system
probably
in
an
immense
vessel
built
a
long
time
ago
and
held
in
readiness
for
just
such
an
emergency
i
am
not
certain
of
their
destination
but
it
is
my
opinion
that
they
have
left
this
galaxy
and
are
planning
upon
starting
anew
upon
some
suitable
planet
in
some
other
galaxy
from
which
at
some
future
date
the
conquest
of
the
universe
shall
proceed
as
it
was
originally
planned
great
balls
of
fire
blurted
seaton
they
could
not
in
a
million
years
he
thought
a
moment
then
continued
more
slowly
but
they
could
and
with
their
dispositions
they
probably
would
you
one
hundred
per
cent
right
drasnik
we
got
a
real
job
of
hunting
on
our
hands
now
and
thanks
a
lot
back
in
the
projector
seaton
prowled
about
in
brown
abstraction
his
villainous
pipe
poisoning
the
circumambient
air
while
crane
sat
quiet
and
as
always
waiting
for
the
nimble
brain
of
his
friend
to
find
a
way
over
around
or
through
the
obstacle
confronting
them
got
it
mart
seaton
yelled
darting
to
the
board
and
setting
up
one
integral
after
another
if
they
did
leave
the
planet
in
a
ship
be
able
to
watch
them
go
and
we
see
what
they
did
anyway
no
matter
what
it
was
how
they
been
gone
almost
a
month
already
protested
crane
we
know
within
half
an
hour
the
exact
time
of
their
departure
simply
go
out
the
distance
light
has
traveled
since
that
time
gather
in
the
rays
given
off
amplify
them
a
few
billion
times
and
take
a
look
at
whatever
went
on
but
we
have
no
idea
of
what
region
of
the
planet
to
study
or
whether
it
was
night
or
day
at
the
point
of
departure
when
they
left
we
get
the
council
room
and
trace
events
from
there
day
or
night
makes
no
difference
we
have
to
use
anyway
because
of
the
fog
and
that
almost
as
good
at
night
as
in
the
daytime
there
is
no
such
thing
as
absolute
darkness
upon
any
planet
anyway
and
we
got
power
enough
to
make
anything
visible
that
happened
there
night
or
day
mart
i
got
power
enough
here
to
see
and
to
photograph
the
actual
construction
of
the
pyramids
of
egypt
in
that
same
way
and
they
were
built
thousands
of
years
ago
heavens
what
astounding
possibilities
breathed
crane
why
you
could
yeah
i
could
do
a
lot
of
things
seaton
interrupted
him
rudely
but
right
now
we
got
other
fish
to
fry
i
just
got
the
city
we
visited
at
about
the
time
we
were
there
general
fenimol
who
disappeared
must
be
in
the
council
room
down
here
right
now
retard
our
projection
so
that
time
will
apparently
pass
more
quickly
and
we
duck
down
there
and
see
what
actually
did
happen
i
can
heterodyne
combine
and
recombine
just
as
though
we
were
watching
the
actual
scene
it
more
complicated
of
course
since
i
have
to
follow
it
and
amplify
it
too
but
it
works
out
all
right
this
is
unbelievable
dick
think
of
actually
seeing
something
that
really
happened
in
the
past
yeah
it
kinda
strong
all
right
as
dot
would
say
it
just
too
perfectly
darn
outrageous
but
we
doing
it
ai
we
i
know
just
how
and
why
when
we
get
some
time
i
shoot
the
method
into
your
brain
well
here
we
are
peering
into
the
visiplates
the
two
men
were
poised
above
the
immense
central
cone
of
the
capital
city
of
the
fenachrone
viewing
with
light
as
they
were
the
fog
presented
no
obstacle
and
the
indescribable
beauty
of
the
city
of
concentric
rings
and
the
wonderfully
luxuriant
jungle
growth
were
clearly
visible
they
plunged
down
into
the
council
chamber
and
saw
fenor
ravindau
and
fenimol
deep
in
conversation
with
all
the
other
feats
of
skill
and
sorcery
you
have
accomplished
why
do
you
reconstruct
their
speech
also
asked
crane
with
a
challenging
glance
well
old
doubting
thomas
it
might
not
be
absolutely
impossible
at
that
it
would
mean
two
projectors
however
due
to
the
difference
in
speed
of
and
theoretically
also
extend
to
an
infinite
distance
but
i
do
believe
that
any
possible
detector
and
amplifier
could
reconstruct
a
voice
more
than
an
hour
or
so
after
it
had
spoken
it
might
though
we
have
to
try
it
some
time
and
see
you
fairly
good
at
as
i
remember
it
get
as
much
of
it
as
you
can
will
you
as
though
they
were
watching
the
scene
itself
as
it
happened
which
in
a
sense
they
were
they
saw
everything
that
had
occurred
they
saw
fenor
die
saw
the
general
family
board
the
airboat
saw
the
orderly
embarkation
of
ravindau
organization
finally
they
saw
the
stupendous
of
the
first
cruiser
and
with
that
seaton
went
into
action
faster
and
faster
he
drove
that
beam
along
the
track
of
the
fugitive
until
a
speed
was
attained
beyond
which
his
detecting
converters
could
not
hold
the
they
were
following
for
many
minutes
seaton
stared
intently
into
the
visiplate
plotting
lines
and
calculating
forces
then
he
swung
around
to
crane
well
mart
noble
old
bean
solving
the
disappearances
was
easier
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
the
situation
as
regards
wiping
out
the
last
of
the
fenachrone
is
getting
no
better
fast
i
glean
from
the
instruments
that
they
are
heading
straight
out
into
space
away
from
the
galaxy
and
i
assume
that
they
are
using
their
utmost
acceleration
i
say
they
traveling
they
out
in
absolute
space
you
know
with
nothing
in
the
way
and
with
no
intention
of
reversing
their
power
or
slowing
down
they
must
had
absolute
top
acceleration
on
every
minute
since
they
left
anyway
they
so
far
out
already
that
i
could
hold
even
a
detector
on
them
let
alone
a
force
that
i
can
control
well
let
snap
into
it
fellow
on
our
way
just
a
minute
dick
take
it
easy
what
are
your
plans
plans
why
worry
about
plans
blow
up
that
planet
before
any
more
of
get
away
and
then
chase
that
boat
clear
to
andromeda
if
necessary
let
go
calm
down
and
be
reasonable
you
are
getting
hysterical
again
they
have
a
maximum
acceleration
of
five
times
the
velocity
of
light
so
have
we
exactly
since
we
adopted
their
own
drive
now
if
our
acceleration
is
the
same
as
theirs
and
they
have
a
month
start
how
long
will
it
take
us
to
catch
them
right
again
mart
i
sure
was
going
off
again
seaton
conceded
ruefully
after
a
moment
thought
they
always
be
going
a
million
or
so
times
as
fast
as
we
would
be
and
getting
further
ahead
of
us
in
geometrical
ratio
what
your
idea
i
agree
with
you
that
the
time
has
come
to
destroy
the
planet
of
fenachrone
as
for
pursuing
that
vessel
through
intergalactic
space
that
is
your
problem
you
must
figure
out
some
method
of
increasing
our
acceleration
highly
efficient
as
is
this
system
of
propulsion
it
seems
to
me
that
the
knowledge
of
the
norlaminians
should
be
able
to
improve
it
in
some
detail
even
a
slight
increase
in
acceleration
would
enable
us
to
overtake
them
eventually
hm
m
seaton
no
longer
impetuous
was
thinking
deeply
how
far
are
we
apt
to
have
to
go
until
we
get
close
enough
to
them
to
use
your
rays
say
half
a
million
but
surely
they
stop
some
time
of
course
but
not
necessarily
for
many
years
they
are
powered
and
provisioned
for
a
hundred
years
you
remember
and
are
going
to
distant
galaxy
such
a
one
as
ravindau
would
not
have
specified
a
galaxy
idly
and
the
very
closest
galaxies
are
so
far
away
that
even
the
fenachrone
astronomers
with
their
reflecting
mirrors
five
miles
in
diameter
could
form
only
the
very
roughest
approximations
of
the
true
distances
our
astronomers
are
all
wet
in
their
guesses
then
their
estimates
are
without
exception
far
below
the
true
values
they
are
not
even
of
the
correct
order
of
magnitude
well
then
let
mop
up
on
that
planet
then
we
go
places
and
do
things
seaton
had
already
located
the
magazines
in
which
the
power
bars
of
the
fenachrone
were
stored
and
it
was
a
short
task
to
erect
a
secondary
projector
of
force
in
the
fenachrone
atmosphere
working
out
of
that
projector
beams
of
force
seized
one
of
the
immense
cylinders
of
plated
copper
and
at
seaton
direction
transported
it
rapidly
to
one
of
the
poles
of
the
planet
where
electrodes
of
force
were
clamped
upon
it
in
a
similar
fashion
seventeen
more
of
the
frightful
bombs
were
placed
equidistant
over
the
surface
of
the
world
of
the
fenachrone
so
that
when
they
were
simultaneously
exploded
the
downward
forces
would
be
certain
to
meet
sufficient
resistance
to
assure
complete
demolition
of
the
entire
globe
everything
in
readiness
seaton
hand
went
to
the
plunger
switch
and
closed
upon
it
then
his
face
white
and
wet
he
dropped
his
hand
no
use
mart
i
ca
do
it
it
pulls
my
cork
i
know
darn
well
you
ca
either
i
yell
for
help
have
you
got
it
on
the
asked
dunark
calmly
as
he
shot
up
into
the
projector
in
reply
to
seaton
call
i
want
to
see
this
all
of
it
it
on
you
welcome
to
it
and
as
the
terrestrials
turned
away
the
whole
projector
base
was
illuminated
by
a
flare
of
intense
though
subdued
light
for
several
minutes
dunark
stared
into
the
visiplate
savage
satisfaction
in
every
line
of
his
fierce
green
face
as
he
surveyed
the
havoc
wrought
by
those
eighteen
enormous
charges
of
incredible
explosive
a
nice
job
of
dick
the
osnomian
prince
reported
turning
away
from
the
visiplate
it
made
a
sun
of
it
the
original
sun
is
now
quite
a
splendid
double
star
everything
was
volatized
clear
out
far
beyond
their
outermost
screen
it
had
to
be
done
of
course
it
was
either
them
or
else
all
the
rest
of
the
universe
season
said
jerkily
however
even
that
fact
make
it
go
down
easy
well
we
done
with
this
projector
from
now
on
it
strictly
up
to
us
and
let
beat
it
over
there
and
see
if
they
got
her
done
yet
they
were
due
to
finish
up
today
you
know
it
was
a
silent
group
who
embarked
in
the
little
airboat
half
way
to
their
destination
however
seaton
came
out
of
his
blue
mood
with
a
yell
mart
i
got
it
we
can
give
the
a
lot
more
acceleration
than
they
are
getting
and
wo
need
the
assistance
of
all
the
minds
of
norlamin
either
how
by
using
one
of
the
very
heavy
metals
for
fuel
the
intensity
of
the
power
liberated
is
a
function
of
atomic
weight
or
atomic
number
and
density
but
the
fact
of
liberation
depends
upon
atomic
configuration
a
fact
which
you
and
i
figured
out
long
ago
however
our
figuring
go
far
enough
it
could
we
did
know
anything
then
copper
happens
to
be
the
most
efficient
of
the
few
metals
which
can
be
decomposed
at
all
under
ordinary
excitation
that
is
by
using
an
ordinary
coil
such
as
we
and
the
fenachrone
both
use
but
by
using
special
exciters
sending
out
all
the
orders
of
rays
necessary
to
initiate
the
disruptive
processes
we
can
use
any
metal
we
want
to
osnome
has
unlimited
quantities
of
the
heaviest
metals
including
radium
and
uranium
of
course
we
ca
use
radium
and
live
but
we
can
and
will
use
uranium
and
that
will
give
us
something
like
four
times
the
acceleration
possible
with
copper
dunark
what
say
you
snap
over
there
and
smelt
us
a
cubic
mile
of
uranium
no
hold
it
i
put
a
flock
of
forces
on
the
job
they
do
it
quicker
and
i
make
deliver
the
goods
deliver
fast
too
believe
us
we
see
to
that
with
a
bar
the
uranium
bars
be
ready
to
load
tomorrow
and
we
have
enough
power
to
chase
those
birds
all
the
rest
of
our
lives
returning
to
the
projector
seaton
actuated
the
complex
system
of
forces
required
for
the
smelting
and
transportation
of
the
enormous
amount
of
metal
necessary
and
as
the
three
men
again
boarded
their
aerial
conveyance
the
in
the
projector
behind
them
flared
into
violet
incandescence
under
the
load
already
put
upon
it
by
the
new
uranium
mine
in
distant
osnome
the
lay
stretched
out
over
two
miles
of
country
exactly
as
they
had
last
seen
her
but
now
instead
of
being
the
cruiser
of
the
void
was
one
jointless
seamless
structure
of
sparkling
transparent
purple
inoson
entering
one
of
the
open
doors
they
stepped
into
an
elevator
and
were
whisked
upward
into
the
control
room
in
which
a
dozen
of
the
aged
students
of
norlamin
were
grouped
about
a
banked
and
tiered
mass
of
keyboards
which
seaton
knew
must
be
the
operating
mechanism
of
the
extraordinarily
complete
projector
he
had
been
promised
ah
youngsters
you
are
just
in
time
everything
is
complete
and
we
are
just
about
to
begin
loading
sorry
rovol
but
we
have
to
make
a
couple
of
changes
have
to
rebuild
the
exciter
or
build
another
one
and
seaton
rapidly
related
what
they
had
learned
and
what
they
had
decided
to
do
of
course
uranium
is
a
much
more
efficient
source
of
power
agreed
rovol
and
you
are
to
be
congratulated
for
thinking
of
it
it
perhaps
would
not
have
occurred
to
one
of
us
since
the
heavy
metals
of
that
highly
efficient
group
are
very
rare
here
building
a
new
exciter
for
uranium
is
a
simple
task
and
the
converters
for
the
will
of
course
require
no
change
since
their
action
depends
only
upon
the
frequency
of
the
emitted
losses
not
upon
their
magnitude
had
you
suspected
that
some
of
the
fenachrone
might
be
going
to
lead
us
a
chase
asked
dunark
curiously
we
have
not
given
the
matter
a
thought
my
son
the
chief
of
the
five
made
answer
as
your
years
increase
you
will
learn
not
to
anticipate
trouble
and
worry
had
we
thought
and
worried
over
the
matter
before
the
time
had
arrived
you
will
note
that
it
would
have
been
pain
wasted
for
our
young
friend
seaton
has
avoided
that
difficulty
in
a
truly
scholarly
fashion
all
set
then
rovol
asked
seaton
when
the
forces
flying
from
the
projector
had
built
the
compound
exciter
which
would
make
possible
the
disruption
of
the
atoms
of
uranium
the
metal
enough
of
it
to
fill
all
the
spare
space
in
the
hull
will
be
here
tomorrow
you
might
give
crane
and
me
the
method
of
operating
this
projector
which
i
see
is
vastly
more
complex
even
than
the
one
in
the
area
of
experiment
it
is
the
most
complete
thing
ever
seen
upon
norlamin
replied
rovol
with
a
smile
each
of
us
installed
everything
in
it
that
he
could
conceive
of
ever
being
of
the
slightest
use
and
since
our
combined
knowledge
covers
a
large
field
the
projector
is
accordingly
quite
comprehensive
multiple
headsets
were
donned
and
from
each
of
the
norlaminian
brains
there
poured
into
the
minds
of
the
two
terrestrials
a
complete
and
minute
knowledge
of
every
possible
application
of
the
stupendous
banked
in
all
its
massed
intricacy
before
them
well
that
some
outfit
exulted
seaton
in
pleased
astonishment
as
the
instructions
were
concluded
it
can
do
anything
but
lay
an
egg
and
i
not
a
darn
bit
sure
that
we
could
make
it
do
that
well
call
the
girls
and
show
them
around
this
thing
that
going
to
be
their
home
for
quite
a
while
while
they
were
waiting
dunark
led
seaton
aside
dick
will
you
need
me
on
this
trip
he
asked
of
course
i
knew
there
was
something
on
your
mind
when
you
did
send
me
home
when
you
let
urvan
carfon
and
the
others
go
back
no
we
going
it
alone
unless
you
want
to
come
along
i
did
want
you
to
stick
around
until
i
got
to
a
good
chance
to
talk
to
you
alone
now
will
be
a
good
a
time
as
any
you
and
i
have
traded
brains
and
besides
we
been
through
quite
a
lot
of
grief
together
here
and
there
i
want
to
apologize
to
you
for
not
passing
along
to
you
all
this
stuff
been
getting
here
in
fact
i
really
wish
i
did
have
to
have
it
myself
get
me
got
you
i
ahead
of
you
do
want
it
not
any
part
of
it
that
why
i
stayed
away
from
any
chance
of
learning
any
of
it
and
the
one
reason
why
i
am
going
back
home
instead
of
going
with
you
i
have
just
brains
enough
to
realize
that
neither
i
nor
any
other
man
of
my
race
should
have
it
by
the
time
we
grow
up
to
it
naturally
we
shall
be
able
to
handle
it
but
not
until
then
the
two
brain
brothers
grasped
hands
strongly
and
dunark
continued
in
a
lighter
vein
it
takes
all
kinds
of
people
to
make
a
world
you
know
and
all
kinds
of
races
except
the
fenachrone
to
make
a
universe
with
mardonale
gone
the
evolution
of
osnome
shall
progress
rapidly
and
while
we
may
not
reach
the
ultimate
goal
i
have
learned
enough
from
you
already
to
speed
up
our
progress
considerably
well
that
that
had
to
get
it
off
my
chest
although
i
knew
get
the
idea
all
right
here
are
the
girls
sitar
too
we
show
around
seaton
first
thought
was
for
the
very
brain
of
the
ship
the
precious
lens
of
neutronium
in
its
thin
envelope
of
the
eternal
jewel
without
which
the
beam
of
rays
could
not
be
directed
he
found
it
a
quarter
of
a
mile
back
from
the
prow
exactly
in
the
longitudinal
axis
of
the
hull
protected
from
any
possible
damage
by
bulkhead
after
massive
bulkhead
of
impregnable
inoson
satisfied
upon
that
point
he
went
in
search
of
the
others
who
were
exploring
their
vast
new
huge
as
she
was
there
was
no
waste
space
her
design
was
as
compact
as
that
of
a
fine
radio
set
the
living
quarters
were
grouped
closely
about
the
central
compartment
which
housed
the
power
plants
the
many
ray
generators
and
projectors
and
the
myriads
of
controls
of
the
marvelous
mechanism
for
the
projection
and
direction
of
rays
several
large
compartments
were
devoted
to
the
machinery
which
automatically
serviced
the
vessel
refrigerators
heaters
generators
and
purifiers
for
water
and
air
and
the
numberless
other
mechanisms
which
would
make
the
cruiser
a
comfortable
and
secure
home
as
well
as
an
invincible
battleship
in
the
heatless
lightless
airless
matterless
waste
of
illimitable
space
many
compartments
were
for
the
storage
of
and
these
were
even
then
being
filled
by
forces
under
the
able
direction
of
the
first
of
chemistry
all
the
comforts
of
home
even
to
the
labels
seaton
grinned
as
he
read
dole
no
upon
cans
of
pineapple
which
had
never
been
within
thousands
of
of
the
hawaiian
islands
and
saw
quarter
after
quarter

very
slowly
at
first
the
unimaginable
mass
of
the
vessel
floated
lightly
upward
crane
spoke
briefly
in
reply
and
the
little
group
of
earthly
wanderers
stepped
into
the
elevator
as
they
sped
upward
toward
the
control
room
door
after
door
shot
into
place
behind
them
establishing
a
manifold
seal
seaton
hand
played
over
the
controls
and
the
great
cruiser
of
the
void
tilted
slowly
upward
until
its
narrow
prow
pointed
almost
directly
into
the
zenith
then
very
slowly
at
first
the
unimaginable
mass
of
the
vessel
floated
lightly
upward
with
a
slowly
increasing
velocity
faster
and
faster
she
flew
out
beyond
measurable
atmosphere
out
beyond
the
outermost
limits
of
the
green
system
finally
in
interstellar
space
seaton
threw
out
detector
and
repelling
screens
anchored
himself
at
the
driving
console
with
a
force
set
the
power
control
at
molecular
so
that
the
propulsive
force
affected
alike
every
molecule
of
the
vessel
and
its
contents
and
all
sense
of
weight
and
acceleration
lost
he
threw
in
the
plunger
switch
which
released
every
iota
of
the
theoretically
possible
power
of
the
driving
mass
of
uranium
staring
intently
into
the
visiplate
he
corrected
their
course
from
time
to
time
by
minute
fractions
of
a
second
of
arc
then
satisfied
at
last
he
set
the
automatic
forces
which
would
guide
them
temporarily
out
of
their
course
around
any
obstacles
such
as
the
uncounted
thousands
of
solar
systems
lying
in
or
near
their
path
he
then
removed
the
restraining
forces
from
his
body
and
legs
and
with
a
small
pencil
of
force
wafted
himself
over
to
crane
and
the
two
women
well
bunch
he
stated
we
on
our
way
we
be
this
way
for
some
time
so
we
might
as
well
get
used
to
it
any
little
thing
you
want
to
talk
over
how
long
will
it
take
us
to
catch
asked
dorothy
traveling
this
way
is
half
as
much
fun
as
it
is
when
you
let
us
have
some
weight
to
hold
us
down
hard
to
tell
exactly
dottie
if
we
had
precisely
four
times
their
acceleration
and
had
started
from
the
same
place
we
would
of
course
overtake
them
in
just
the
number
of
days
they
had
the
start
of
us
since
the
distance
covered
at
any
constant
positive
acceleration
is
proportional
to
the
square
of
the
time
elapsed
however
there
are
several
complicating
factors
in
the
actual
situation
we
started
out
not
only
days
behind
them
but
also
a
matter
of
five
hundred
thousand
of
distance
it
will
take
us
quite
a
while
to
get
to
their
i
ca
tell
even
that
very
close
as
we
will
probably
have
to
reduce
this
acceleration
before
we
get
out
of
the
galaxy
in
order
to
give
detectors
and
repellers
time
to
act
on
stars
and
other
loose
impediments
powerful
as
those
screens
are
and
fast
as
they
work
there
is
a
limit
to
the
velocity
we
can
use
here
in
this
crowded
galaxy
outside
it
in
free
space
of
course
we
can
open
her
up
again
then
too
our
acceleration
is
not
exactly
four
times
theirs
only
three
point
nine
one
eight
six
on
the
other
hand
we
do
have
to
catch
them
to
go
to
work
on
them
we
can
operate
very
nicely
at
five
thousand
so
there
you
are
it
probably
be
somewhere
between
and
days
but
it
may
be
a
day
or
so
more
or
less
how
do
you
know
they
are
using
copper
asked
margaret
maybe
their
scientists
stored
up
some
uranium
and
know
how
to
use
it
nope
that
out
like
a
light
first
mart
and
i
saw
only
copper
bars
in
their
ship
second
copper
is
the
most
efficient
metal
found
in
quantity
upon
their
planet
third
even
if
they
had
uranium
or
any
metal
of
its
class
they
could
use
it
without
a
complete
knowledge
of
and
ability
to
handle
the
fourth
and
fifth
orders
of
rays
it
is
your
opinion
then
that
destroying
this
last
fenachrone
vessel
is
to
prove
as
simple
a
matter
as
did
the
destruction
of
the
others
crane
queried
pointedly
never
thought
about
it
from
that
angle
at
all
mart
still
the
thinker
of
the
outfit
ai
you
now
that
you
mention
it
though
we
may
find
that
the
last
of
the
mohicans
entirely
toothless
at
that
but
say
mart
how
come
i
as
wild
and
as
i
ever
was
rovol
a
slow
and
thoughtful
old
codger
and
with
his
accumulation
of
knowledge
it
looks
like
i
be
the
same
way
far
from
it
crane
replied
your
nature
and
mine
remain
unchanged
temperament
is
a
basic
trait
of
heredity
and
is
neither
affected
nor
acquired
by
increase
of
knowledge
you
acquired
knowledge
from
rovol
drasnik
and
others
as
did
i
but
you
are
still
the
flashing
genius
and
i
am
still
your
balance
wheel
as
for
fenachrone
toothlessness
now
that
you
have
considered
it
what
is
your
opinion
hard
to
say
they
did
know
how
to
control
the
fifth
order
rays
or
they
would
have
run
they
got
real
brains
though
and
have
something
like
seventy
days
to
work
on
the
problem
while
it
does
stand
to
reason
that
they
could
find
out
much
in
seventy
days
still
they
may
have
had
a
of
instruments
on
their
detectors
that
would
have
enabled
them
to
analyze
our
fields
and
thus
compute
the
structure
of
the
secondary
projector
we
used
there
if
so
it
take
them
long
to
find
out
enough
to
give
us
plenty
of
grief
but
i
do
really
believe
that
they
knew
enough
i
do
quite
know
what
to
think
they
may
be
easy
and
they
may
not
but
easy
or
hard
to
get
we
loaded
for
bear
and
i
plenty
sure
that
we
pull
their
corks
so
am
i
really
but
we
must
consider
every
contingency
we
know
that
they
had
at
least
a
detector
of
rays
and
if
they
did
have
an
analytical
detector
seaton
interrupted
they
probably
slap
a
ray
on
us
as
soon
as
we
stick
our
nose
out
of
the
galaxy
they
may
and
even
though
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
probability
of
them
actually
doing
it
it
will
be
well
to
be
armed
against
the
possibility
right
old
top
we
do
that
little
thing
uneventful
days
passed
and
true
to
seaton
calculations
the
awful
acceleration
with
which
they
had
started
out
could
not
be
maintained
a
few
days
before
the
edge
of
the
galaxy
was
reached
it
became
necessary
to
cut
off
the
molecular
drive
and
to
proceed
with
an
acceleration
equal
only
to
that
of
gravitation
at
the
surface
of
the
earth
tired
of
weightlessness
and
its
attendant
discomforts
to
everyday
life
the
travelers
enjoyed
the
interlude
immensely
but
it
was
all
too
short
too
soon
the
stars
thinned
out
ahead
of
needle
prow
as
soon
as
the
way
ahead
of
them
was
clear
seaton
again
put
on
the
maximum
power
of
his
terrific
bars
and
held
securely
at
the
console
set
up
a
long
and
involved
integral
ready
to
transfer
the
blended
and
assembled
forces
to
a
plunger
he
stayed
his
hand
thought
a
moment
and
turned
to
crane
want
some
advice
mart
i
thought
of
setting
up
three
or
four
courses
of
screen
on
the
board
a
detector
screen
on
the
outside
of
each
course
next
to
it
a
repeller
then
a
screen
then
a
zone
of
force
and
a
as
a
liner
then
with
them
all
set
up
on
the
board
but
not
out
throw
out
a
wide
detector
that
detector
would
react
upon
the
board
at
impact
with
anything
hostile
and
automatically
throw
out
the
courses
it
found
necessary
that
sounds
like
ample
protection
but
i
am
not
enough
of
a
to
pass
an
opinion
upon
what
point
are
you
doubtful
about
leaving
them
on
the
board
the
only
trouble
is
that
the
reaction
is
absolutely
instantaneous
even
rays
would
require
a
millionth
of
a
second
or
so
to
set
the
courses
now
if
they
were
using
ether
waves
that
would
be
lots
of
time
to
block
them
but
if
they
happen
to
have
stuff
it
get
here
the
same
time
our
own
would
and
it
just
barely
conceivable
that
they
might
give
us
a
nasty
jolt
before
the
defenses
went
out
nope
developing
a
cautious
streak
myself
now
when
i
take
time
to
do
it
we
got
lots
of
uranium
and
i
going
to
put
one
course
out
you
can
not
put
everything
out
can
you
not
quite
but
pretty
nearly
i
leave
a
hole
in
the
ether
screen
to
pass
visible
light
no
i
wo
either
you
folks
can
see
just
as
well
even
on
the
wall
plates
with
light
heterodyned
on
the
fifth
so
we
close
all
ether
bands
absolutely
all
we
have
to
leave
open
will
be
the
one
extremely
narrow
band
upon
which
our
projector
is
operating
and
i
protect
that
with
a
detector
screen
also
i
going
to
send
out
all
four
courses
instead
of
only
one
then
i
we
all
right
suppose
they
find
our
one
band
narrow
as
it
is
of
course
if
that
were
shut
off
automatically
by
the
detector
we
be
safe
but
would
we
not
be
out
of
control
not
necessarily
i
see
you
did
get
quite
all
this
stuff
over
the
educator
the
other
projector
worked
that
way
on
one
fixed
band
out
of
the
nine
thousand
odd
possible
but
this
one
is
an
an
improvement
invented
at
the
last
minute
its
carrier
wave
can
be
shifted
at
will
from
one
band
of
the
fifth
order
to
any
other
one
and
i
bet
a
hat
that
thing
the
fenachrone
have
got
any
other
suggestions
all
right
let
get
busy
a
single
light
detector
was
sent
out
ahead
of
four
courses
of
screen
then
seaton
fingers
again
played
over
the
keys
fabricating
a
detector
screen
so
tenuous
that
it
would
react
to
nothing
weaker
than
a
copper
power
bar
in
full
operation
and
with
so
nearly
absolute
zero
resistance
that
it
could
be
driven
at
the
full
velocity
of
his
then
while
crane
watched
the
instruments
closely
and
while
dorothy
and
margaret
watched
the
faces
of
their
husbands
with
only
mild
interest
seaton
drove
home
the
plunger
that
sent
that
prodigious
and
fan
ahead
of
them
with
a
velocity
unthinkable
millions
of
times
that
of
light
for
five
minutes
until
that
screen
had
gone
as
far
as
it
could
be
thrown
by
the
utmost
power
of
the
uranium
bar
the
two
men
stared
at
the
unresponsive
instruments
then
seaton
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
had
a
hunch
he
remarked
with
a
grin
they
did
wait
for
us
a
second
do
care
for
some
says
they
already
had
any
they
running
in
a
straight
line
with
full
power
on
and
do
intend
to
stop
or
slow
down
how
do
you
know
asked
dorothy
by
the
distance
how
far
away
are
they
i
know
by
what
i
did
find
out
with
that
screen
i
just
put
out
it
did
reach
them
and
it
went
so
far
that
the
distance
is
absolutely
meaningless
even
expressed
in
parsecs
well
a
stern
chase
is
proverbially
a
long
chase
and
i
guess
this
one
is
going
to
be
any
exception
every
eight
hours
seaton
launched
his
but
day
after
day
passed
and
the
instruments
remained
motionless
after
each
cast
of
that
gigantic
net
for
several
days
the
galaxy
behind
them
had
been
dwindling
from
a
mass
of
stars
down
to
a
huge
bright
lens
down
to
a
small
faint
lens
down
to
a
faintly
luminous
patch
at
the
previous
cast
of
the
detector
it
had
still
been
visible
as
a
point
of
light
in
the
highest
telescopic
power
of
the
visiplate
now
as
dorothy
and
seaton
alone
in
the
control
room
stared
into
that
visiplate
everything
was
blank
and
black
sheer
indescribable
blackness
the
utter
and
absolute
absence
of
everything
visible
or
tangible
this
is
awful
dick
it
just
too
darn
horrible
it
simply
scares
me
she
shuddered
as
she
drew
herself
to
him
and
he
swept
both
his
mighty
arms
around
her
in
a
embrace
right
darling
that
stuff
out
there
scare
anybody
i
scared
purple
myself
it
is
in
any
finite
mind
to
understand
anything
infinite
or
absolute
there
one
redeeming
feature
though
we
together
you
chirped
it
lover
dorothy
returned
his
caresses
with
all
her
fervor
and
enthusiasm
i
feel
lots
better
now
if
it
gets
to
you
that
way
too
i
know
it
perfectly
normal
i
was
beginning
to
think
maybe
i
was
yellow
or
something
but
maybe
you
kidding
me
she
held
him
off
at
arm
length
looking
deep
into
his
eyes
then
reassured
went
his
arms
nope
you
feel
it
too
and
her
glorious
auburn
head
found
its
natural
in
the
curve
of
his
mighty
shoulder
yellow
you
seaton
pressed
his
wife
closer
still
and
laughed
aloud
maybe
but
so
is
picric
acid
so
is
nitroglycerin
and
so
is
pure
gold
flatterer
her
low
entrancing
chuckle
bubbled
over
but
you
know
i
just
revel
in
it
i
kiss
you
for
that
it
awfully
lonesome
out
here
without
even
a
star
to
look
at
she
went
on
after
a
time
then
laughed
again
if
the
cranes
and
shiro
were
along
we
be
really
at
last
would
we
i
say
we
would
but
that
reminds
me
of
something
according
to
my
figures
we
might
have
been
able
to
detect
the
fenachrone
on
the
last
test
but
we
did
think
i
try
again
before
we
turn
in
once
more
he
flung
out
that
tenuous
net
of
force
and
as
it
reached
the
extreme
limit
of
its
travel
the
needle
of
the
flickered
slightly
barely
moving
off
its
zero
mark
whee
whoopee
he
yelled
mart
we
on
close
demanded
crane
hurrying
into
the
control
room
upon
his
beam
anything
but
barely
touched
current
something
less
than
a
thousandth
of
a
on
a
million
to
one
however
it
proves
our
ideas
are
the
next
day
was
running
on
eastern
standard
time
of
the
terrestrial
united
states
of
america
the
two
mathematicians
covered
sheet
after
sheet
of
paper
with
computations
and
curves
after
checking
and
rechecking
the
figures
seaton
shut
off
the
power
released
the
molecular
drive
and
applied
acceleration
of
point
six
oh
two
feet
per
second
and
five
human
beings
breathed
as
one
a
profound
sigh
of
relief
as
an
force
of
gravitation
was
restored
to
them
why
the
asked
dorothy
they
an
awful
long
ways
off
yet
are
they
why
not
hurry
up
and
catch
them
because
we
going
infinitely
faster
than
they
are
now
if
we
kept
up
full
acceleration
we
pass
them
so
fast
that
we
could
fight
them
at
all
this
way
we
still
be
going
a
lot
faster
than
they
are
when
we
get
close
to
them
but
not
enough
faster
to
keep
us
from
maneuvering
relatively
to
their
vessel
if
things
should
go
that
far
guess
take
another
reading
on
i
do
not
believe
that
i
should
crane
suggested
thoughtfully
after
all
they
may
have
perfected
their
instruments
and
yet
may
not
have
detected
that
extremely
light
touch
of
our
ray
last
night
if
so
why
put
them
on
guard
they
probably
on
guard
all
right
without
having
to
be
put
there
but
it
a
sound
idea
anyway
along
the
same
line
i
release
the
screens
with
the
fastest
possible
detector
on
guard
we
just
about
within
reach
of
a
light
ray
right
now
but
it
a
cinch
they
ca
send
anything
heavy
this
far
and
if
they
think
we
overconfident
so
much
the
better
there
he
continued
after
a
few
minutes
at
the
keyboard
all
set
if
they
put
a
detector
on
us
i
got
a
force
set
to
make
a
noise
like
a
new
york
city
fire
siren
if
pressed
i
reluctantly
admit
that
in
my
opinion
we
carrying
caution
to
a
point
ten
thousand
degrees
below
the
absolute
zero
of
sanity
i
bet
my
shirt
that
we
do
hear
a
yip
out
of
them
before
we
touch
off
furthermore
the
rest
of
his
sentence
was
lost
in
a
crescendo
bellow
of
sound
seaton
still
at
the
controls
shut
off
the
noise
studied
his
meters
carefully
and
turned
around
to
crane
with
a
grin
you
win
the
shirt
mart
i
give
it
to
you
next
wednesday
when
my
other
one
comes
back
from
the
laundry
it
a
detector
ray
coming
in
beautifully
on
band
fifty
right
in
the
middle
of
the
order
are
you
going
to
put
a
ray
on
asked
dorothy
in
surprise
nope
what
the
use
i
can
read
theirs
as
well
as
i
could
one
of
my
own
maybe
they
know
that
too
if
they
do
we
let
think
coming
along
as
innocent
as
mary
little
lamb
so
i
let
their
ray
stay
on
us
it
too
thin
to
carry
anything
and
if
they
thicken
it
up
much
i
got
an
axe
set
to
chop
it
off
seaton
whistled
a
merry
lilting
refrain
as
his
fingers
played
over
the
stops
and
keys
why
dick
you
seem
actually
pleased
about
it
margaret
was
plainly
ill
at
ease
sure
am
i
never
did
like
to
drown
baby
kittens
and
it
kinda
goes
against
the
grain
to
stab
a
guy
in
the
back
when
he
ai
even
looking
even
if
he
is
a
fenachrone
if
they
can
fight
back
some
i
get
mad
enough
to
blow
up
happy
but
suppose
they
fight
back
too
hard
they
ca
the
worst
that
can
possibly
happen
is
that
we
ca
lick
them
they
certainly
ca
lick
us
because
we
can
outrun
if
we
ca
get
alone
we
beat
it
back
to
norlamin
and
bring
up
i
am
not
so
sure
crane
spoke
slowly
there
is
i
believe
a
theoretical
possibility
that
rays
exist
would
an
extension
of
the
methods
of
detection
of
rays
reveal
them
sweet
spirits
of
niter
nobody
knows
anything
about
them
however
i
had
one
surprise
already
so
maybe
your
suggestion
as
crazy
as
it
sounds
we
got
three
or
four
days
yet
before
either
side
can
send
anything
except
on
the
sixth
so
i
find
out
what
i
can
do
he
flew
at
the
task
and
for
the
next
three
days
could
hardly
be
torn
from
it
for
rest
but
mart
he
finally
announced
they
exist
all
right
and
i
can
detect
look
here
and
he
pointed
to
a
tiny
receiver
upon
which
a
small
lamp
flared
in
brilliant
scarlet
light
are
they
sending
them
no
fortunately
they
coming
from
our
bar
see
it
shines
blue
when
i
put
a
grounded
shield
between
it
and
the
bar
and
stays
blue
when
i
attach
it
to
their
detector
ray
can
you
direct
them
not
a
chance
in
the
world
that
means
a
lifetime
probably
many
lifetimes
of
research
unless
somebody
uses
a
fairly
complete
pattern
of
them
close
enough
to
this
detector
so
that
i
can
analyze
it
good
deal
like
calculus
in
that
respect
it
took
thousands
of
years
to
get
it
in
the
first
place
but
it
easy
when
somebody
that
already
knows
it
shows
you
how
it
goes
the
fenachrone
learned
to
direct
rays
so
quickly
then
by
an
analysis
of
our
projector
there
our
secondary
projector
yes
they
must
have
had
some
neutronium
in
stock
too
but
it
would
have
been
funny
if
they
had
at
that
they
had
power
for
ages
silent
and
grim
he
seated
himself
at
the
console
and
for
an
hour
he
wove
an
intricate
pattern
of
forces
upon
the
inexhaustible
supply
of
keys
afforded
by
the
before
he
once
touched
a
plunger
what
are
you
doing
i
followed
you
for
a
few
hundred
steps
but
could
go
no
farther
merely
a
little
stuff
in
case
they
should
send
any
real
pattern
of
rays
this
will
analyze
it
record
the
complete
analysis
throw
out
a
screen
against
every
frequency
of
the
pattern
throw
on
the
molecular
drive
and
pull
us
back
toward
the
galaxy
at
full
acceleration
while
switching
the
frequency
of
our
carrier
wave
a
thousand
times
a
second
to
keep
them
from
shooting
a
hot
one
through
our
open
band
it
do
it
all
in
about
a
millionth
of
a
second
too
i
want
to
get
us
all
back
alive
if
possible
hm
shut
off
their
ray
they
know
we
tapped
onto
it
well
war
declared
now
we
see
what
we
can
see
transferring
the
assembled
beam
to
a
plunger
he
sent
out
a
secondary
projector
toward
the
fenachrone
vessel
as
fast
as
it
could
be
driven
close
behind
a
widespread
detector
net
he
soon
found
the
enemy
cruiser
but
so
immense
was
the
distance
that
it
was
impossible
to
hold
the
projection
anywhere
in
its
neighborhood
they
flashed
beyond
it
and
through
it
and
upon
all
sides
of
it
but
the
utmost
delicacy
of
the
controls
would
not
permit
of
holding
even
upon
the
immense
bulk
of
the
vessel
to
say
nothing
of
holding
upon
such
a
relatively
tiny
object
as
the
power
bar
as
they
flashed
repeatedly
through
the
warship
they
saw
piecemeal
and
sketchily
her
formidable
armament
and
the
hundreds
of
men
of
her
crew
each
man
at
battle
station
at
the
controls
of
some
frightful
engine
of
destruction
suddenly
they
were
cut
off
as
a
screen
closed
behind
them
the
felt
an
instant
of
unreasoning
terror
as
it
seemed
that
of
their
peculiar
dual
personalities
vanished
utterly
seaton
laughed
that
was
a
funny
sensation
was
it
it
just
means
that
climbed
a
tree
and
pulled
the
tree
up
after
them
i
do
not
like
the
odds
dick
crane
face
was
grave
they
have
many
hundreds
of
men
all
trained
and
we
are
only
two
yes
only
one
for
i
count
for
nothing
at
those
controls
all
the
better
mart
this
board
more
than
makes
up
the
difference
they
got
a
lot
of
stuff
of
course
but
they
have
got
anything
like
this
control
system
their
captain
got
to
issue
orders
whereas
i
got
everything
right
under
my
hands
not
so
uneven
as
they
think
within
battle
range
at
last
seaton
hurled
his
utmost
concentration
of
direct
forces
under
the
impact
of
which
three
courses
of
fenachrone
defensive
screen
flared
through
the
and
went
black
there
the
massed
direct
attack
was
stopped
at
what
cost
the
enemy
alone
knew
and
the
fenachrone
countered
instantly
and
in
a
manner
totally
unexpected
through
the
narrow
slit
in
the
screen
through
which
seaton
was
operating
in
the
bare
of
a
second
that
it
was
open
so
exactly
synchronized
and
timed
that
the
screens
did
not
even
glow
as
it
went
through
the
narrow
opening
a
gigantic
beam
of
heterodyned
force
struck
full
upon
the
bow
of
the
near
the
prow
and
the
stubborn
metal
instantly
flared
blinding
white
and
exploded
outward
in
puffs
of
incandescent
gas
under
the
awful
power
of
that
titanic
thrust
through
four
successive
skins
of
inoson
the
theoretical
ultimate
of
possible
strength
toughness
and
resistance
that
frightful
beam
drove
before
the
detector
closed
the
slit
and
the
impregnable
defensive
screens
driven
by
their
mighty
uranium
bars
flared
into
incandescent
defense
driven
as
they
were
they
held
and
the
fenachrone
finding
that
particular
attack
useless
shut
off
their
power
wow
they
sure
have
got
something
seaton
exclaimed
in
unfeigned
admiration
they
sure
gave
us
a
solid
kick
that
time
we
will
now
take
time
out
for
repairs
also
i
going
to
cut
our
slit
down
to
a
width
of
one
kilocycle
if
i
can
possibly
figure
out
a
way
of
working
on
that
narrow
a
band
and
i
going
to
step
up
our
shifting
speed
to
a
hundred
thousand
it
a
good
thing
they
built
this
ship
of
ours
in
a
lot
of
layers
if
that
go
through
the
interior
we
would
have
been
punctured
for
fair
you
might
weld
up
those
holes
mart
while
i
see
what
i
can
do
here
then
seaton
noticed
the
women
white
and
trembling
upon
a
seat
cheer
up
kids
you
ai
seen
nothing
yet
that
was
just
a
couple
of
little
preliminary
like
two
boxers
kinda
feeling
each
other
out
in
the
first
ten
seconds
of
the
first
round
preliminary
repeated
dorothy
looking
into
seaton
eyes
and
being
reassured
by
the
serene
confidence
she
read
there
but
they
hit
us
and
hurt
us
badly
why
there
a
hole
in
our
as
big
as
a
house
and
it
goes
through
four
or
five
layers
yes
but
we
not
hurt
a
bit
they
easily
fixed
and
we
lost
nothing
but
a
few
tons
of
inoson
and
uranium
we
got
lots
of
spare
metal
i
do
know
what
i
did
to
him
any
more
than
he
knows
what
he
did
to
us
but
i
bet
my
other
shirt
that
he
knows
he
been
nudged
repairs
completed
and
the
changes
made
in
the
method
of
projection
seaton
actuated
the
slit
and
peered
through
it
at
the
enemy
vessel
finding
their
screens
still
up
he
directed
a
attack
upon
them
with
four
bars
while
with
the
entire
massed
power
of
the
remaining
generators
concentrated
into
one
frequency
he
shifted
that
frequency
up
and
down
the
spectrum
probing
probing
ever
probing
with
that
gigantic
beam
of
intolerable
energy
feeling
for
some
crack
however
slight
into
which
he
could
insert
that
searing
sheet
of
concentrated
destruction
although
much
of
the
available
power
of
the
fenachrone
was
perforce
devoted
to
repelling
the
continuous
attack
of
the
terrestrials
they
maintained
an
equally
continuous
attack
offensive
and
in
spite
of
the
narrowness
of
the
open
slit
and
the
rapidity
with
which
that
slit
was
changing
from
frequency
to
frequency
enough
of
the
frightful
forces
came
through
to
keep
the
defensive
screens
radiating
far
into
the
violet
and
the
utmost
power
of
the
refrigerating
system
proving
absolutely
useless
against
the
concentrated
beams
being
employed
mass
after
mass
of
inoson
was
literally
blown
from
the
outer
and
secondary
skins
of
the
by
the
comparatively
tiny
jets
of
force
that
leaked
through
the
momentarily
open
slit
from
time
to
time
as
exact
synchronization
was
accidentally
obtained
seaton
grimly
watching
his
instruments
glanced
at
crane
who
calm
but
watchful
at
his
console
was
repairing
the
damage
as
fast
as
it
was
done
they
sending
more
stuff
mart
and
it
getting
hotter
to
handle
that
means
they
building
more
projectors
we
can
play
that
game
too
they
using
up
their
fuel
reserves
fast
but
we
bigger
than
they
are
carry
more
metal
and
it
more
efficient
metal
too
only
one
way
out
of
it
i
guess
what
say
we
put
in
enough
generators
to
smother
them
down
by
brute
force
no
matter
how
much
power
it
takes
why
do
you
use
some
of
those
awful
copper
shells
or
are
we
close
enough
yet
dorothy
low
voice
came
clearly
so
utterly
silent
was
that
frightful
combat
close
we
still
better
than
two
hundred
thousand
apart
there
may
have
been
battles
than
this
somewhere
in
the
universe
but
i
doubt
it
and
as
for
copper
even
if
we
could
get
it
to
them
it
be
just
like
so
many
candy
kisses
compared
to
the
stuff
both
using
dear
girl
there
are
fields
of
force
extending
for
thousands
of
miles
from
each
of
these
vessels
beside
which
the
exact
center
of
the
biggest
lightning
flash
you
ever
saw
would
be
a
dead
area
he
set
up
a
series
of
integrals
and
machine
after
machine
in
a
space
left
vacant
by
the
store
of
uranium
there
appeared
inside
the
fourth
skin
of
the
a
row
of
gigantic
generators
each
one
adding
its
hellish
output
to
the
already
inconceivable
stream
of
energy
being
directed
at
the
foe
as
that
frightful
flow
increased
by
leaps
and
bounds
the
intensity
of
the
fenachrone
attack
diminished
and
finally
it
ceased
altogether
as
every
iota
of
the
enemy
power
became
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
the
defenses
still
greater
grew
the
stream
of
force
from
the
and
now
that
the
attack
had
ceased
seaton
opened
the
slit
wider
and
stopped
its
shifting
in
order
still
further
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
his
terrible
weapon
face
set
in
a
fighting
mask
and
eyes
hard
as
gray
iron
deeper
and
deeper
he
drove
his
now
irresistible
forces
his
flying
fingers
were
upon
the
keys
of
his
console
his
keen
and
merciless
eyes
were
in
a
secondary
projector
near
the
now
doomed
ship
of
the
fenachrone
directing
masterfully
his
terrible
attack
as
the
output
of
his
generators
still
increased
seaton
began
to
compress
a
searing
hollow
sphere
of
seething
energy
upon
the
defensive
screens
of
the
fenachrone
course
after
course
of
the
heaviest
possible

sent
out

by
massed

flare
through

to
go
down
before
that
dreadful
that
irresistible
onslaught
finally
as
the
inexorable
sphere
still
contracted
the
utmost
efforts
of
the
defenders
could
not
keep
their
screens
away
from
their
own

and
simultaneously
the
prow
and
the
stern
of
the
fenachrone
cruiser
was
bared
to
that
awful
field
of
force
in
which
no
possible
substance
could
endure
for
even
the
most
infinitesimal
instant
of
time
there
was
a
sudden
cessation
of
all
resistance
and
those
titanic
forces
all
directed
inward
converged
upon
a
point
with
a
power
behind
which
there
was
the
inconceivable
energy
of
four
hundred
thousand
tons
of
uranium
being
disintegrated
at
the
highest
possible
rate
short
of
instant
disruption
in

instant

the
enormous
mass
of
in

the
vessel
every
atom
alike
of
structure
and
contents
also
exploded
into
pure
energy
at
the
touch
of
that
unimaginable
field
of
force
in
that
awful
moment
before
seaton
could
shut
off
his
power
it
seemed
to
him
that
space
itself
must
be
obliterated
by
the
very
concentration
of
the
unknowable
and
incalculable
forces
there
unleashed
must
be
swallowed
up
and
lost
in
the
utterly
indescribable
brilliance
of
the
field
of
radiance
driven
to
a
distance
of
millions
upon
incandescent
millions
of
miles
from
the
place
where
the
last
representatives
of
the
monstrous
civilization
of
the
fenachrone
had
made
their
last
stand
against
the
forces

universal
peace
epilogue
the
moving
talking
almost
living
picture
being
shown
simultaneously
in
all
the
viewing
areas
throughout
the
innumerable
planets
of
the
galaxy
faded
out
and
the
image
of
an
aged
norlaminian
appeared
and
spoke
in
the
galactic
language
as
is
customary
the
showing
of
this
picture
has
opened
the
celebration
of
our
great
galactic
holiday
civilization
day
as
you
all
know
it
portrays
the
events
leading
up
to
and
making
possible
the
formation
of
the
league
of
civilization
by
a
mere
handful
of
planets
the
league
now
embraces
all
of
this
the
first
galaxy
and
is
spreading
rapidly
throughout
the
universe
varied
are
the
physical
forms
and
varied
are
the
mentalities
of
our
almost
innumerable
races
of
beings
but
in
civilization
we
are
becoming
one
since
those
backward
people
who
will
not
with
us
are
rendered
impotent
to
impede
our
progress
among
the
more
enlightened
it
is
peculiarly
fitting
that
the
one
who
has
just
been
chosen
to
head
the
galactic
council
the
first
person
of
a
race
other
than
one
of
those
of
the
central
system
to
prove
himself
able
to
wield
justly
the
vast
powers
of
that
office
should
be
a
direct
descendant
of
two
of
the
revered
persons
whose
deeds
of
olden
times
we
have
just
witnessed
i
present
to
you
my
successor
as
chief
of
the
galactic
council
richard
ballinger
seaton
the
fourteen
hundred
of
earth
the
end
some
remarks
on
the
skylark
three
and
about
errors
a
compliment
to
smith
stories
amazing
stories
smith
in
his
foreword
to
skylark
three
mentions
two
errors
which
he
made
knowingly
i
think
i
can
recognize
the
astronomical
one
at
any
rate
of
course
the
acceleration
of
twice
miles
per
second
as
used
in
escaping
the
field
of
the
great
dud
star
as
told
in
skylark
of
space
was
impossible
nothing
could
withstand
that
strain
further
no
gravitational
field
could
be
that
intense
it
would
have
exactly
the
effect
smith
describes
and
allots
to
the
zone
of
force
in
skylark
three
it
would
make
a
hole
in
space
and
pull
the
hole
in
after
it
light
would
be
too
heavy
to
leave
the
planet
the
effect
on
space
would
be
so
great
as
to
curve
it
so
violently
as
to
shut
it
in
about
it
like
a
blanket
the
dud
would
be
both
invisible
and
unapproachable
the
astronomical
error
i
wonder
how
smith
solved
the
problem
of
three
or
more
bodies
osnome
is
a
planet
of
a
sun
in
a
group
of
seventeen
suns
is
it
not
the
gravitational
field
about
even
two
suns
is
so
exceedingly
complex
that
a
planet
could
take
up
an
orbit
only
such
that
one
sun
was
at
each
of
the
two
foci
of
the
ellipse
of
its
orbit
and
then
only
provided
the
suns
were
of
very
nearly
the
same
mass
and
stationary
which
in
turn
means
they
must
have
attraction
for
each
other
no
i
think
his
complex
system
of
seventeen
suns
would
not
be
so
good
for
planets
celestial
mechanics
wo
let
them
stay
there
and
i
really
do
see
why
it
was
necessary
to
have
so
complex
a
system
further
i
wonder
if
smith
considered
the
proposition
of
his
ammonia
cooling
plant
carefully
the
ammonia
cooling
plant
works
only
to
heat
not
to
remove
it
the
heat
is
removed
by
it
from
the
inside
of
an
icebox
for
instance
and
put
outside
which
is
what
is
wanted
however
it
must
have
some
place
to
dump
the
heat
in
the
fight
with
the
mardonalians
seaton
has
an
arenak
cylinder
on
his
compressor
and
runs
it
very
heavily
but
if
he
ca
get
the
heat
outside
the
ship
and
away
from
it
he
would
cool
the
machine
at
all
since
the
mardonalians
kept
the
outside
so
hot
and
the
story
says
the
was
accomplished
by
a
water
cooler
which
boiled
some
amount
of
water
too
if
it
would
absorb
all
the
heat
of
that
mardonalian
fleet
in
any
way
and
this
heat
was
then
merely
transferred
from
outside
to
inside
where
they
did
want
it
again
in
this
battle
to
protect
themselves
against
radiation
they
smear
themselves
with
paint
presumably
because
red
will
stop
personalty
i
have
picked
some
paint
if
any
were
handy
as
that
would
the
rays
red
would
affect
them
at
all
so
far
as
i
can
see
he
might
as
well
have
used
blue
what
he
wanted
was
a
complementary
color
of
and
i
do
believe
it
is
red
green
is
the
complement
of
red
green
light
wo
pass

smith
invited
knocks
with
that
foreword
of
his
i
hope
i
am
complying
as
an
interested
reader
and
a
hopeful
scientist
however
my
personal
opinion
has
always
been
that
skylark
of
space
was
the
best
story
of
scientifiction
ever
printed
without
exception
i
have
recently
changed
my
opinion
however
since
skylark
three
has
come
out
john
campbell
cambridge
mass
this
letter
from
a
fellow
author
is
an
excellent
comment
on
foreword
to
skylark
three
but
the
writer
of
this
letter
is
himself
inclined
to
deal
with
and
use
very
large
quantities
and
high
accelerations
and
velocities
in
his
stories
we
are
going
to
let
your
knocks
await
a
reply
from
smith
the
editor
does
not
desire
to
find
himself
between
the
upper
and
lower
millstones
represented
by
an
author
and
his
critic
but
you
certainly
make
amends
for
your
criticism
by
what
you
say
about
the
merit
of
the
skylark
stories

to
