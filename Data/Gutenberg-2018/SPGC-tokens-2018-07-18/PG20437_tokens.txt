the
frog
prince
in
the
olden
time
when
wishing
was
having
there
lived
a
king
whose
daughters
were
all
beautiful
but
the
youngest
was
so
exceedingly
beautiful
that
the
sun
himself
although
he
saw
her
very
often
was
enchanted
every
time
she
came
out
into
the
sunshine
near
the
castle
of
this
king
was
a
large
and
gloomy
forest
and
in
the
midst
stood
an
old
beneath
whose
branches
splashed
a
little
fountain
so
whenever
it
was
very
hot
the
king
youngest
daughter
ran
off
into
this
wood
and
sat
down
by
the
side
of
this
fountain
and
when
she
felt
dull
would
often
divert
herself
by
throwing
a
golden
ball
up
in
the
air
and
catching
it
and
this
was
her
favourite
amusement
now
one
day
it
happened
that
this
golden
ball
when
the
daughter
threw
it
into
the
air
did
not
fall
down
into
her
hand
but
on
the
grass
and
then
it
rolled
past
her
into
the
fountain
the
daughter
followed
the
ball
with
her
eyes
but
it
disappeared
beneath
the
water
which
was
so
deep
that
no
one
could
see
to
the
bottom
then
she
began
to
lament
and
to
cry
louder
and
louder
and
as
she
cried
a
voice
called
out
why
weepest
thou
o
king
daughter
thy
tears
would
melt
even
a
stone
to
pity
and
she
looked
around
to
the
spot
whence
the
voice
came
and
saw
a
frog
stretching
his
thick
ugly
head
out
of
the
water
ah
you
old
said
she
was
it
you
that
spoke
i
am
weeping
for
my
golden
ball
which
has
slipped
away
from
me
into
the
water
illustration
be
quiet
and
do
not
cry
answered
the
frog
i
can
give
thee
good
advice
but
what
wilt
thou
give
me
if
i
fetch
thy
plaything
up
again
what
will
you
have
dear
frog
said
she
my
dresses
my
pearls
and
jewels
or
the
golden
crown
which
i
wear
the
frog
answered
dresses
or
jewels
or
golden
crowns
are
not
for
me
but
if
thou
wilt
love
me
and
let
me
be
thy
companion
and
playfellow
and
sit
at
thy
table
and
eat
from
thy
little
golden
plate
and
drink
out
of
thy
cup
and
sleep
in
thy
little
bed
if
thou
wilt
promise
me
all
these
then
will
i
dive
down
and
fetch
up
thy
golden
ball
illustration
oh
i
will
promise
you
all
said
she
if
you
will
only
get
me
my
ball
but
she
thought
to
herself
what
is
the
silly
frog
chattering
about
let
him
remain
in
the
water
with
his
equals
he
can
not
mix
in
society
but
the
frog
as
soon
as
he
had
received
her
promise
drew
his
head
under
the
water
and
dived
down
presently
he
swam
up
again
with
the
ball
in
his
mouth
and
threw
it
on
the
grass
the
king
daughter
was
full
of
joy
when
she
again
saw
her
beautiful
plaything
and
taking
it
up
she
ran
off
immediately
stop
stop
cried
the
frog
take
me
with
thee
i
can
not
run
as
thou
canst
but
all
his
croaking
was
useless
although
it
was
loud
enough
the
king
daughter
did
not
hear
it
but
hastening
home
soon
forgot
the
poor
frog
who
was
obliged
to
leap
back
into
the
fountain
the
next
day
when
the
king
daughter
was
sitting
at
table
with
her
father
and
all
his
courtiers
and
was
eating
from
her
own
little
golden
plate
something
was
heard
coming
up
the
marble
stairs
and
when
it
arrived
at
the
top
it
knocked
at
the
door
and
a
voice
said
open
the
door
thou
youngest
daughter
of
the
king
so
she
rose
and
went
to
see
who
it
was
that
called
her
but
when
she
opened
the
door
and
caught
sight
of
the
frog
she
shut
it
again
with
great
vehemence
and
sat
down
at
the
table
looking
very
pale
but
the
king
perceived
that
her
heart
was
beating
violently
and
asked
her
whether
it
were
a
giant
who
had
come
to
fetch
her
away
who
stood
at
the
door
oh
no
answered
she
it
is
no
giant
but
an
ugly
frog
what
does
the
frog
want
with
you
said
the
king
oh
dear
father
when
i
was
sitting
yesterday
playing
by
the
fountain
my
golden
ball
fell
into
the
water
and
this
frog
fetched
it
up
again
because
i
cried
so
much
but
first
i
must
tell
you
he
pressed
me
so
much
that
i
promised
him
he
should
be
my
companion
i
never
thought
that
he
could
come
out
of
the
water
but
somehow
he
has
jumped
out
and
now
he
wants
to
come
in
here
at
that
moment
there
was
another
knock
and
a
voice
said
king
daughter
youngest
open
the
door
hast
thou
forgotten
thy
promises
made
at
the
fountain
so
clear
the
shade
king
daughter
youngest
open
the
door
then
the
king
said
what
you
have
promised
that
you
must
perform
go
and
let
him
in
so
the
king
daughter
went
and
opened
the
door
and
the
frog
hopped
in
after
her
right
up
to
her
chair
and
as
soon
as
she
was
seated
the
frog
said
take
me
up
but
she
hesitated
so
long
that
at
last
the
king
ordered
her
to
obey
and
as
soon
as
the
frog
sat
on
the
chair
he
jumped
on
to
the
table
and
said
now
push
thy
plate
near
me
that
we
may
eat
together
and
she
did
so
but
as
everyone
saw
very
unwillingly
the
frog
seemed
to
relish
his
dinner
much
but
every
bit
that
the
king
daughter
ate
nearly
choked
her
till
at
last
the
frog
said
i
have
satisfied
my
hunger
and
feel
very
tired
wilt
thou
carry
me
upstairs
now
into
thy
chamber
and
make
thy
bed
ready
that
we
may
sleep
together
at
this
speech
the
king
daughter
began
to
cry
for
she
was
afraid
of
the
cold
frog
and
dared
not
touch
him
and
besides
he
actually
wanted
to
sleep
in
her
own
beautiful
clean
bed
illustration
illustration
but
her
tears
only
made
the
king
very
angry
and
he
said
he
who
helped
you
in
the
time
of
your
trouble
must
not
now
be
despised
so
she
took
the
frog
up
with
two
fingers
and
put
him
in
a
corner
of
her
chamber
but
as
she
lay
in
her
bed
he
crept
up
to
it
and
said
i
am
so
very
tired
that
i
shall
sleep
well
do
take
me
up
or
i
will
tell
thy
father
this
speech
put
the
king
daughter
in
a
terrible
passion
and
catching
the
frog
up
she
threw
him
with
all
her
strength
against
the
wall
saying
now
will
you
be
quiet
you
ugly
frog
but
as
he
fell
he
was
changed
from
a
frog
into
a
handsome
prince
with
beautiful
eyes
who
after
a
little
while
became
with
her
consent
her
dear
companion
and
betrothed
then
he
told
her
how
he
had
been
transformed
by
an
evil
witch
and
that
no
one
but
herself
could
have
had
the
power
to
take
him
out
of
the
fountain
and
that
on
the
morrow
they
would
go
together
into
his
own
kingdom
illustration
illustration
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
the
sun
rose
a
carriage
drawn
by
eight
white
horses
with
ostrich
feathers
on
their
heads
and
golden
bridles
drove
up
to
the
door
of
the
palace
and
behind
the
carriage
stood
the
trusty
henry
the
servant
of
the
young
prince
when
his
master
was
changed
into
a
frog
trusty
henry
had
grieved
so
much
that
he
had
bound
three
iron
bands
round
his
heart
for
fear
it
should
break
with
grief
and
sorrow
but
now
that
the
carriage
was
ready
to
carry
the
young
prince
to
his
own
country
the
faithful
henry
helped
in
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
placed
himself
in
the
seat
behind
full
of
joy
at
his
master
release
they
had
not
proceeded
far
when
the
prince
heard
a
crack
as
if
something
had
broken
behind
the
carriage
so
he
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
asked
henry
what
was
broken
and
henry
answered
it
was
not
the
carriage
my
master
but
a
band
which
i
bound
round
my
heart
when
it
was
in
such
grief
because
you
were
changed
into
a
frog
twice
afterwards
on
the
journey
there
was
the
same
noise
and
each
time
the
prince
thought
that
it
was
some
part
of
the
carriage
that
had
given
way
but
it
was
only
the
breaking
of
the
bands
which
bound
the
heart
of
the
trusty
henry
who
was
thenceforward
free
and
happy
princess
once
upon
a
time
there
were
three
princesses
named
roussette
brunette
and
blondine
who
lived
in
retirement
with
their
mother
a
princess
who
had
lost
all
her
former
grandeur
one
day
an
old
woman
called
and
asked
for
a
dinner
as
this
princess
was
an
excellent
cook
after
the
meal
was
over
the
old
woman
who
was
a
fairy
promised
that
their
kindness
should
be
rewarded
and
immediately
disappeared
shortly
after
the
king
came
that
way
with
his
brother
and
the
lord
admiral
they
were
all
so
struck
with
the
beauty
of
the
three
princesses
that
the
king
married
the
youngest
blondine
his
brother
married
brunette
and
the
lord
admiral
married
roussette
the
good
fairy
who
had
brought
all
this
about
also
caused
the
young
queen
blondine
to
have
three
lovely
children
two
boys
and
a
girl
out
of
whose
hair
fell
fine
jewels
each
had
a
brilliant
star
on
the
forehead
and
a
rich
chain
of
gold
around
the
neck
at
the
same
time
brunette
her
sister
gave
birth
to
a
handsome
boy
now
the
young
queen
and
brunette
were
much
attached
to
each
other
but
roussette
was
jealous
of
both
and
the
old
queen
the
king
mother
hated
them
brunette
died
soon
after
the
birth
of
her
son
and
the
king
was
absent
on
a
warlike
expedition
so
roussette
joined
the
wicked
old
queen
in
forming
plans
to
injure
blondine
they
ordered
feintise
the
old
queen
to
strangle
the
queen
three
children
and
the
son
of
princess
brunette
and
bury
them
secretly
but
as
she
was
about
to
execute
this
wicked
order
she
was
so
struck
by
their
beauty
and
the
appearance
of
the
sparkling
stars
on
their
foreheads
that
she
shrank
from
the
deed
so
she
had
a
boat
brought
round
to
the
beach
and
put
the
four
babes
with
some
strings
of
jewels
into
a
cradle
which
she
placed
in
the
boat
and
then
set
it
adrift
the
boat
was
soon
far
out
at
sea
the
waves
rose
the
rain
poured
in
torrents
and
the
thunder
roared
feintise
could
not
doubt
that
the
boat
would
be
swamped
and
felt
relieved
by
the
thought
that
the
poor
little
innocents
would
perish
for
she
would
otherwise
always
be
haunted
by
the
fear
that
something
would
occur
to
betray
the
share
she
had
had
in
their
preservation
illustration
but
the
good
fairy
protected
them
and
after
floating
at
sea
for
seven
days
they
were
picked
up
by
a
corsair
he
was
so
struck
by
their
beauty
that
he
altered
his
course
and
took
them
home
to
his
wife
who
had
no
children
she
was
transported
with
joy
when
he
placed
them
in
her
hands
they
admired
together
the
wonderful
stars
the
chains
of
gold
that
could
not
be
taken
off
their
necks
and
their
long
ringlets
much
greater
was
the
woman
astonishment
when
she
combed
them
for
at
every
instant
there
rolled
out
of
their
hair
pearls
rubies
diamonds
and
emeralds
she
told
her
husband
of
it
who
was
not
less
surprised
than
herself
i
am
very
tired
said
he
of
a
corsair
life
and
if
the
locks
of
those
little
children
continue
to
supply
us
with
such
treasures
i
will
give
up
roaming
the
seas
the
corsair
wife
whose
name
was
corsine
was
enchanted
at
this
and
loved
the
four
infants
so
much
the
more
for
it
she
named
the
princess
her
eldest
brother
the
second
heureux
and
the
son
of
brunette
cheri
as
they
grew
older
the
corsair
applied
himself
seriously
to
their
education
as
he
felt
convinced
there
was
some
great
mystery
attached
to
their
birth
the
corsair
and
his
wife
had
never
told
the
story
of
the
four
children
who
passed
for
their
own
they
were
exceedingly
united
but
prince
cheri
entertained
for
princess
a
greater
affection
than
the
other
two
the
moment
she
expressed
a
wish
for
anything
he
would
attempt
even
impossibilities
to
gratify
her
one
day
overheard
the
corsair
and
his
wife
talking
when
i
fell
in
with
them
said
the
corsair
i
saw
nothing
that
could
give
me
any
idea
of
their
birth
i
suspect
said
corsine
that
cheri
is
not
their
brother
he
has
neither
star
nor
immediately
ran
and
told
this
to
the
three
princes
who
resolved
to
speak
to
the
corsair
and
his
wife
and
ask
them
to
let
them
set
out
to
discover
the
secret
of
their
birth
after
some
remonstrance
they
gained
their
consent
a
beautiful
vessel
was
prepared
and
the
young
princess
and
the
three
princes
set
out
they
determined
to
sail
to
the
very
spot
where
the
corsair
had
found
them
and
made
preparations
for
a
grand
sacrifice
to
the
fairies
for
their
protection
and
guidance
they
were
about
to
immolate
a
but
the
princess
saved
its
life
and
let
it
fly
at
this
moment
a
syren
issued
from
the
water
and
said
cease
your
anxiety
let
your
vessel
go
where
it
will
land
where
it
stops
the
vessel
now
sailed
more
quickly
suddenly
they
came
in
sight
of
a
city
so
beautiful
that
they
were
anxious
their
vessel
should
enter
the
port
their
wishes
were
accomplished
they
landed
and
the
shore
in
a
moment
was
crowded
with
people
who
had
observed
the
magnificence
of
their
ship
they
ran
and
told
the
king
the
news
and
as
the
grand
terrace
of
the
palace
looked
out
upon
the
he
speedily
repaired
thither
the
princes
hearing
the
people
say
there
is
the
king
looked
up
and
made
a
profound
obeisance
he
looked
earnestly
at
them
and
was
as
much
charmed
by
the
princess
beauty
as
by
the
handsome
mien
of
the
young
princes
he
ordered
his
equerry
to
offer
them
his
protection
and
everything
that
they
might
require
illustration
the
king
was
so
interested
about
these
four
children
that
he
went
into
the
chamber
of
the
queen
his
mother
to
tell
her
of
the
wonderful
stars
which
shone
upon
their
foreheads
and
everything
that
he
admired
in
them
she
was
thunderstruck
at
it
and
was
terribly
afraid
that
feintise
had
betrayed
her
and
sent
her
secretary
to
enquire
about
them
what
he
told
her
of
their
ages
confirmed
her
suspicions
she
sent
for
feintise
and
threatened
to
kill
her
feintise
half
dead
with
terror
confessed
all
but
promised
if
she
spared
her
that
she
would
still
find
means
to
do
away
with
them
the
queen
was
appeased
and
indeed
old
feintise
did
all
she
could
for
her
own
sake
taking
a
guitar
she
went
and
sat
down
opposite
the
princess
window
and
sang
a
song
which
thought
so
pretty
that
she
invited
her
into
her
chamber
my
fair
child
said
feintise
heaven
has
made
you
very
lovely
but
you
yet
want
one
thing
the
if
i
had
possessed
it
you
would
not
have
seen
a
white
hair
upon
my
head
nor
a
wrinkle
on
my
face
alas
i
knew
this
secret
too
late
my
charms
had
already
faded
but
where
shall
i
find
this
asked
it
is
in
the
luminous
forest
said
feintise
you
have
three
brothers
does
not
any
one
of
them
love
you
sufficiently
to
go
and
fetch
some
my
brothers
all
love
me
said
the
princess
but
there
is
one
of
them
who
would
not
refuse
me
anything
the
perfidious
old
woman
retired
delighted
at
having
been
so
successful
the
princes
returning
from
the
chase
found
engrossed
by
the
advice
of
feintise
her
anxiety
about
it
was
so
apparent
that
cheri
who
thought
of
nothing
but
pleasing
her
soon
found
out
the
cause
of
it
and
in
spite
of
her
entreaties
he
mounted
his
white
horse
and
set
out
in
search
of
the
when
arrived
and
the
princess
did
not
see
her
brother
cheri
she
could
neither
eat
nor
drink
and
desired
he
might
be
sought
for
everywhere
and
sent
messengers
to
find
him
and
bring
him
back
illustration
the
wicked
feintise
was
very
anxious
to
know
the
result
of
her
advice
and
when
she
heard
that
cheri
had
already
set
out
she
was
delighted
and
reported
to
the
all
that
had
passed
i
admit
madam
said
she
that
i
can
no
longer
doubt
that
they
are
the
same
four
children
but
one
of
the
princes
is
already
gone
to
seek
the
and
will
no
doubt
perish
in
the
attempt
and
i
shall
find
similar
means
to
do
away
with
all
of
them
the
plan
she
had
adopted
with
regard
to
prince
cheri
was
one
of
the
most
certain
for
the
was
not
easily
to
be
obtained
it
was
so
notorious
from
the
misfortunes
which
occurred
to
all
who
sought
it
that
every
one
knew
the
road
to
it
he
was
eight
days
without
taking
any
repose
but
in
the
woods
at
the
end
of
this
period
he
began
to
suffer
very
much
from
the
heat
but
it
was
not
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
he
did
not
know
the
cause
of
it
until
from
the
top
of
a
mountain
he
perceived
the
luminous
forest
all
the
trees
were
burning
without
being
consumed
and
casting
out
flames
to
such
a
distance
that
the
country
around
was
a
dry
desert
at
this
terrible
scene
he
descended
and
more
than
once
gave
himself
up
for
lost
as
he
approached
this
great
fire
he
was
ready
to
die
with
thirst
and
perceiving
a
spring
falling
into
a
marble
basin
he
alighted
from
his
horse
approached
it
and
stooped
to
take
up
some
water
in
the
little
golden
vase
which
he
had
brought
with
him
when
he
saw
a
drowning
in
the
fountain
cheri
took
pity
on
it
and
saved
it
my
lord
cheri
she
said
i
am
not
ungrateful
i
can
guide
you
to
the
which
without
me
you
could
never
obtain
as
it
rises
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
and
can
only
be
reached
by
going
underground
the
dove
then
flew
away
and
summoned
a
number
of
foxes
badgers
moles
snails
ants
and
all
sorts
of
creatures
that
burrow
in
the
earth
cheri
got
off
his
horse
at
the
entrance
of
the
subterranean
passage
they
made
for
him
and
groped
his
way
after
the
kind
dove
which
safely
conducted
him
to
the
fountain
the
prince
filled
his
golden
vase
and
returned
the
same
way
he
came
he
found
sorrowfully
seated
under
some
trees
but
when
she
saw
him
she
was
so
pleased
that
she
scarcely
knew
how
to
welcome
him
old
feintise
learned
from
her
spies
that
cheri
had
returned
and
that
the
princess
having
washed
her
face
with
the
had
become
more
lovely
than
ever
finding
this
she
lost
no
time
in
artfully
making
the
princess
sigh
for
the
wonderful
prince
cheri
again
found
her
unhappy
and
again
found
out
the
cause
and
once
more
set
out
on
his
white
horse
leaving
a
letter
for
illustration
in
the
meanwhile
the
king
did
not
forget
the
lovely
children
and
reproached
them
for
never
going
to
the
palace
they
excused
themselves
by
saying
that
their
brother
absence
prevented
them
prince
cheri
at
break
of
day
perceived
a
handsome
young
man
from
whom
he
learned
where
the
was
to
be
found
but
after
travelling
some
time
without
seeing
any
sign
of
it
he
saw
a
poor
fall
at
his
feet
almost
dead
he
took
pity
on
it
and
restored
it
when
it
said
handsome
cheri
you
are
destined
to
save
my
life
and
i
to
do
you
signal
service
you
are
come
to
seek
for
the
it
is
guarded
by
a
terrible
dragon
the
dove
then
led
him
to
a
place
where
he
found
a
suit
of
armour
all
of
glass
and
by
her
advice
he
put
it
on
and
boldly
went
to
meet
the
dragon
the
monster
came
bounding
along
fire
issuing
from
his
throat
but
when
he
saw
his
alarming
figure
multiplied
in
the
prince
mirrors
he
was
frightened
in
his
turn
he
stopped
and
looking
fiercely
at
the
prince
apparently
laden
with
dragons
he
took
flight
and
threw
himself
into
a
deep
chasm
the
prince
then
found
the
tree
which
was
surrounded
with
human
bones
and
breaking
off
an
apple
prepared
to
return
to
the
princess
she
had
never
slept
during
his
absence
and
ran
to
meet
him
eagerly
when
the
wicked
feintise
heard
the
sweet
singing
of
the
apple
her
grief
was
excessive
for
instead
of
doing
harm
to
these
lovely
children
she
only
did
them
good
by
her
perfidious
counsels
she
allowed
some
days
to
pass
by
without
showing
herself
and
then
once
more
made
the
princess
unhappy
by
saying
that
the
and
the
were
useless
without
the
little
green
bird
that
tells
everything
cheri
again
set
out
and
after
some
trouble
learnt
that
this
bird
was
to
be
found
on
the
top
of
a
frightful
rock
in
a
frozen
climate
at
length
at
dawn
of
day
he
perceived
the
rock
which
was
very
high
and
very
steep
and
upon
the
summit
of
it
was
the
bird
speaking
like
an
oracle
telling
wonderful
things
he
thought
that
with
a
little
dexterity
it
would
be
easy
to
catch
it
for
it
seemed
very
tame
he
got
off
his
horse
and
climbed
up
very
quietly
he
was
so
close
to
the
green
bird
that
he
thought
he
could
lay
hands
on
it
when
suddenly
the
rock
opened
and
he
fell
into
a
spacious
hall
and
became
as
motionless
as
a
statue
he
could
neither
stir
nor
utter
a
complaint
at
his
deplorable
situation
three
hundred
knights
who
had
made
the
same
attempt
were
in
the
same
state
to
look
at
each
other
was
the
only
thing
permitted
them
the
time
seemed
so
long
to
and
still
no
signs
of
her
beloved
cheri
that
she
fell
dangerously
ill
and
in
the
hopes
of
curing
her
resolved
to
seek
him
illustration
but
he
too
was
swallowed
up
by
the
rock
and
fell
into
the
great
hall
the
first
person
he
saw
was
cheri
but
he
could
not
speak
to
him
and
prince
heureux
following
soon
after
met
with
the
same
fate
as
the
other
two
when
feintise
was
aware
that
the
third
prince
was
gone
she
was
exceedingly
delighted
at
the
success
of
her
plan
and
when
inconsolable
at
finding
not
one
of
her
brothers
return
reproached
herself
for
their
loss
and
resolved
to
follow
them
she
was
quite
overjoyed
the
princess
was
disguised
as
a
cavalier
but
had
no
other
armour
than
her
helmet
she
was
dreadfully
cold
as
she
drew
near
the
rock
but
seeing
a
lying
on
the
snow
she
took
it
up
warmed
it
and
restored
it
to
life
and
the
dove
reviving
gaily
said
i
know
you
in
spite
of
your
disguise
follow
my
advice
when
you
arrive
at
the
rock
remain
at
the
bottom
and
begin
to
sing
the
sweetest
song
you
know
the
green
bird
will
listen
to
you
you
must
then
pretend
to
go
to
sleep
when
it
sees
me
it
will
come
down
to
peck
me
and
at
that
moment
you
will
be
able
to
seize
it
all
this
fell
out
as
the
dove
foretold
the
green
bird
begged
for
liberty
first
said
i
wish
that
thou
wouldst
restore
my
three
brothers
to
me
under
my
left
wing
there
is
a
red
feather
said
the
bird
pull
it
out
and
touch
the
rock
with
it
the
princess
hastened
to
do
as
she
was
instructed
the
rock
split
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
she
entered
with
a
victorious
air
the
hall
in
which
stood
the
three
princes
with
many
others
she
ran
towards
cheri
who
did
not
know
her
in
her
helmet
and
male
attire
and
could
neither
speak
nor
move
the
green
bird
then
told
the
princess
she
must
rub
the
eyes
and
mouth
of
all
those
she
wished
to
disenchant
with
the
red
feather
which
good
office
she
did
to
all
the
three
princes
and
hastened
to
present
themselves
to
the
king
and
when
showed
her
treasures
the
little
green
bird
told
him
that
the
princes
and
heureux
and
the
princess
were
his
children
and
that
prince
cheri
was
his
nephew
queen
blondine
who
had
mourned
for
them
all
these
years
embraced
them
and
the
wicked
and
old
feintise
were
justly
punished
and
the
king
who
thought
his
nephew
cheri
the
handsomest
man
at
court
consented
to
his
marriage
with
and
lastly
to
make
everyone
happy
the
king
sent
for
the
corsair
and
his
wife
who
gladly
came
illustration
aladdin
and
the
wonderful
lamp
aladdin
was
the
son
of
a
poor
tailor
in
an
eastern
city
he
was
a
spoiled
boy
and
loved
play
better
than
work
so
that
when
mustapha
his
father
died
he
was
not
able
to
earn
his
living
and
his
poor
mother
had
to
spin
cotton
all
day
long
to
procure
food
for
their
support
but
she
dearly
loved
her
son
knowing
that
he
had
a
good
heart
and
she
believed
that
as
he
grew
older
he
would
do
better
and
become
at
last
a
worthy
and
prosperous
man
one
day
when
aladdin
was
walking
outside
the
town
an
old
man
came
up
to
him
and
looking
very
hard
in
his
face
said
he
was
his
father
brother
and
had
long
been
away
in
a
distant
country
but
that
now
he
wished
to
help
his
nephew
to
get
on
he
then
put
a
ring
on
the
boy
finger
telling
him
that
no
harm
could
happen
to
him
so
long
as
he
wore
it
now
this
strange
man
was
no
uncle
of
aladdin
nor
was
he
related
at
all
to
him
but
he
was
a
wicked
magician
who
wanted
to
make
use
of
the
lad
services
as
we
shall
see
presently
illustration
the
old
man
led
aladdin
a
good
way
into
the
country
until
they
came
to
a
very
lonely
spot
between
two
lofty
black
mountains
here
he
lighted
a
fire
and
threw
into
it
some
gum
all
the
time
repeating
many
strange
words
the
ground
then
opened
just
before
them
and
a
stone
appeared
after
lifting
this
up
the
magician
told
aladdin
to
go
below
down
some
broken
steps
and
at
the
foot
of
these
he
would
find
three
halls
in
the
last
of
which
was
a
door
leading
to
a
garden
full
of
beautiful
trees
this
he
was
to
cross
and
after
mounting
some
more
steps
he
would
come
to
a
terrace
when
he
would
see
a
niche
in
which
there
was
a
lighted
lamp
he
was
then
to
take
the
lamp
put
out
the
light
empty
the
oil
and
bring
it
away
with
him
illustration
aladdin
found
all
the
magician
had
told
him
to
be
true
he
passed
quickly
but
cautiously
through
the
three
halls
so
as
not
even
to
touch
the
walls
with
his
clothes
as
the
magician
had
directed
he
took
the
lamp
from
the
niche
threw
out
the
oil
and
put
it
in
his
bosom
as
he
came
back
through
the
garden
his
eyes
were
dazzled
with
the
fruits
on
the
trees
shining
like
glass
many
of
these
he
plucked
and
put
in
his
pockets
and
then
returned
with
the
lamp
and
called
upon
his
uncle
to
help
him
up
the
broken
steps
give
me
the
lamp
said
the
old
man
angrily
not
till
i
get
out
safe
cried
the
boy
the
magician
in
a
passion
then
slammed
down
the
and
aladdin
was
shut
up
fast
enough
while
crying
bitterly
he
by
chance
rubbed
the
ring
and
a
figure
appeared
before
him
saying
i
am
your
slave
the
genius
of
the
ring
what
do
you
desire
illustration
aladdin
told
the
genius
of
the
ring
that
he
only
wanted
to
be
set
free
and
to
be
taken
back
to
his
mother
in
an
instant
he
found
himself
at
home
very
hungry
and
his
poor
mother
was
much
pleased
to
see
him
again
he
told
her
all
that
had
happened
she
then
felt
curious
to
look
at
the
lamp
he
had
brought
and
began
rubbing
it
to
make
it
shine
brighter
both
were
quite
amazed
at
seeing
rise
before
them
a
strange
figure
this
proved
to
be
the
genius
of
the
lamp
who
asked
for
their
commands
on
hearing
that
food
was
what
they
most
wanted
a
black
slave
instantly
entered
with
the
choicest
fare
upon
a
dainty
dish
of
silver
and
with
silver
plates
for
them
to
eat
from
aladdin
and
his
mother
feasted
upon
the
rich
fare
brought
to
them
and
sold
the
silver
dish
and
plates
on
the
produce
of
which
they
lived
happily
for
some
weeks
aladdin
was
now
able
to
dress
well
and
in
taking
his
usual
walk
he
one
day
chanced
to
see
the
sultan
daughter
coming
with
her
attendants
from
the
baths
he
was
so
much
struck
with
her
beauty
that
he
fell
in
love
with
her
at
once
and
told
his
mother
that
she
must
go
to
the
sultan
and
ask
him
to
give
the
princess
to
be
his
wife
the
poor
woman
said
he
must
be
crazy
but
her
son
not
only
knew
what
a
treasure
he
had
got
in
the
magic
lamp
but
he
had
also
found
how
valuable
were
the
shining
fruits
he
had
gathered
which
he
thought
at
the
time
to
be
only
coloured
glass
at
first
he
sent
a
bowlful
of
these
jewels
for
so
they
were
to
the
sultan
who
was
amazed
at
their
richness
and
said
to
aladdin
mother
your
son
shall
have
his
wish
if
he
can
send
me
in
a
week
forty
bowls
like
this
carried
by
twenty
white
and
twenty
black
slaves
handsomely
dressed
he
thought
by
this
to
keep
what
he
had
got
and
to
hear
no
more
of
aladdin
but
the
genius
of
the
lamp
soon
brought
the
bowls
of
jewels
and
the
slaves
and
aladdin
mother
went
with
them
to
the
sultan
illustration
the
sultan
was
overjoyed
at
receiving
these
rich
gifts
and
at
once
agreed
that
the
princess
bulbul
should
be
the
wife
of
aladdin
the
happy
youth
then
summoned
the
genius
of
the
lamp
to
assist
him
and
shortly
set
out
for
the
palace
he
was
dressed
in
a
handsome
suit
of
clothes
and
rode
a
beautiful
horse
by
his
side
marched
a
number
of
attendants
scattering
handfuls
of
gold
among
the
people
as
soon
as
they
were
married
aladdin
ordered
the
genius
of
the
lamp
to
build
in
the
course
of
a
night
a
most
superb
palace
and
there
the
young
couple
lived
quite
happily
for
some
time
one
day
when
aladdin
was
out
hunting
with
the
sultan
the
wicked
magician
who
had
heard
of
his
good
luck
and
wished
to
get
hold
of
the
magic
lamp
cried
out
in
the
streets
new
lamps
for
old
ones
a
silly
maid
in
the
palace
hearing
this
got
leave
of
the
princess
to
change
aladdin
old
lamp
which
she
had
seen
on
a
cornice
where
he
always
left
it
for
a
new
one
and
so
the
magician
got
possession
of
it
illustration
as
soon
as
the
magician
had
safely
got
the
lamp
he
caused
the
genius
to
remove
the
palace
and
bulbul
within
it
to
africa
aladdin
grief
was
very
great
and
so
was
the
rage
of
the
sultan
at
the
loss
of
the
princess
and
poor
aladdin
life
was
in
some
danger
for
the
sultan
threatened
to
kill
him
if
he
did
not
restore
his
daughter
in
three
days
aladdin
first
called
upon
the
genius
of
the
ring
to
help
him
but
all
he
could
do
was
to
take
him
to
africa
the
princess
was
rejoiced
to
see
him
again
but
was
very
sorry
to
find
that
she
had
been
the
cause
of
all
their
trouble
by
parting
with
the
wonderful
lamp
aladdin
however
consoled
her
and
told
her
that
he
had
thought
of
a
plan
for
getting
it
back
he
then
left
her
but
soon
returned
with
a
powerful
and
advised
