once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
village
shop
the
name
over
the
window
was
ginger
and
pickles
it
was
a
little
small
shop
just
the
right
size
for
dolls
lucinda
and
jane
always
bought
their
groceries
at
ginger
and
pickles
the
counter
inside
was
a
convenient
height
for
rabbits
ginger
and
pickles
sold
red
spotty
at
a
penny
three
farthings
they
also
sold
sugar
and
snuff
and
galoshes
in
fact
although
it
was
such
a
small
shop
it
sold
nearly
everything
except
a
few
things
that
you
want
in
a
hurry
like
bootlaces
and
mutton
chops
ginger
and
pickles
were
the
people
who
kept
the
shop
ginger
was
a
yellow
and
pickles
was
a
terrier
the
rabbits
were
always
a
little
bit
afraid
of
pickles
illustration
illustration
the
shop
was
also
patronized
by
mice
only
the
mice
were
rather
afraid
of
ginger
ginger
usually
requested
pickles
to
serve
them
because
he
said
it
made
his
mouth
water
i
can
not
bear
said
he
to
see
them
going
out
at
the
door
carrying
their
little
parcels
i
have
the
same
feeling
about
rats
replied
pickles
but
it
would
never
do
to
eat
our
own
customers
they
would
leave
us
and
go
to
tabitha
twitchit
on
the
contrary
they
would
go
nowhere
replied
ginger
gloomily
tabitha
twitchit
kept
the
only
other
shop
in
the
village
she
did
not
give
credit
illustration
illustration
ginger
and
pickles
gave
unlimited
credit
now
the
meaning
of
credit
is
this
when
a
customer
buys
a
bar
of
soap
instead
of
the
customer
pulling
out
a
purse
and
paying
for
it
she
says
she
will
pay
another
time
and
pickles
makes
a
low
bow
and
says
with
pleasure
madam
and
it
is
written
down
in
a
book
the
customers
come
again
and
again
and
buy
quantities
in
spite
of
being
afraid
of
ginger
and
pickles
but
there
is
no
money
in
what
is
called
the
till
illustration
illustration
the
customers
came
in
crowds
every
day
and
bought
quantities
especially
the
toffee
customers
but
there
was
always
no
money
they
never
paid
for
as
much
as
a
pennyworth
of
peppermints
but
the
sales
were
enormous
ten
times
as
large
as
tabitha
twitchit
illustration
as
there
was
always
no
money
ginger
and
pickles
were
obliged
to
eat
their
own
goods
pickles
ate
biscuits
and
ginger
ate
a
dried
haddock
they
ate
them
by
after
the
shop
was
closed
illustration
when
it
came
to
there
was
still
no
money
and
pickles
was
unable
to
buy
a
dog
licence
it
is
very
unpleasant
i
am
afraid
of
the
police
said
pickles
it
is
your
own
fault
for
being
a
terrier
do
not
require
a
licence
and
neither
does
kep
the
collie
dog
it
is
very
uncomfortable
i
am
afraid
i
shall
be
summoned
i
have
tried
in
vain
to
get
a
licence
upon
credit
at
the
post
office
said
pickles
the
place
is
full
of
policemen
i
met
one
as
i
was
coming
home
let
us
send
in
the
bill
again
to
samuel
whiskers
ginger

owes

sure
that

replied
ginger
illustration
ginger

pickles
retired
into
the
back
parlour
they
did
accounts
they
added
up
sums
and
sums
and
sums
samuel
whiskers
has
run
up
a
bill
as
long
as
his
tail
he
has
had
an
ounce

replied
ginger
illustration
illustration
after
a
time
they
heard
a
noise
in
the
shop
as
if
something
had
been
pushed
in
at
the
door
they
came
out
of
the
back
parlour
there
was
an
envelope
lying
on
the
counter
and
a
policeman
writing
in
a
pickles
nearly
had
a
fit
he
barked
and
he
barked
and
made
little
rushes
bite
him
pickles
bite
him
spluttered
ginger
behind
a
he
only
a
german
doll
the
policeman
went
on
writing
in
his
notebook
twice
he
put
his
pencil
in
his
mouth
and
once
he
dipped
it
in
the
treacle
pickles
barked
till
he
was
hoarse
but
still
the
policeman
took
no
notice
he
had
bead
eyes
and
his
helmet
was
sewed
on
with
stitches
illustration
at
length
on
his
last
little
rush
pickles
found
that
the
shop
was
empty
the
policeman
had
disappeared
but
the
envelope
remained
illustration
illustration
do
you
think
that
he
has
gone
to
fetch
a
real
live
policeman
i
am
afraid
it
is
a
summons
said
pickles
no
replied
ginger
who
had
opened
the
envelope
it
is
the
rates
and
taxes
this
is
the
last
straw
said
pickles
let
us
close
the
shop
they
put
up
the
shutters
and
left
but
they
have
not
removed
from
the
neighbourhood
in
fact
some
people
wish
they
had
gone
further
illustration
ginger
is
living
in
the
warren
i
do
not
know
what
occupation
he
pursues
he
looks
stout
and
comfortable
illustration
illustration
pickles
is
at
present
a
gamekeeper
illustration
the
closing
of
the
shop
caused
great
inconvenience
tabitha
twitchit
immediately
raised
the
price
of
everything
a
and
she
continued
to
refuse
to
give
credit
of
course
there
are
the
carts
the
butcher
the
and
timothy
baker
but
a
person
can
not
live
on
seed
wigs
and
and
not
even
when
the
is
as
good
as
timothy
illustration
after
a
time
john
dormouse
and
his
daughter
began
to
sell
peppermints
and
candles
but
they
did
not
keep
sixes
and
it
takes
five
mice
to
carry
one
seven
inch
candle
illustration
illustration
besides
the
candles
which
they
sell
behave
very
strangely
in
warm
weather
illustration
and
miss
dormouse
refused
to
take
back
the
ends
when
they
were
brought
back
to
her
with
complaints
and
when
john
dormouse
was
complained
to
he
stayed
in
bed
and
would
say
nothing
but
very
snug
which
is
not
the
way
to
carry
on
a
retail
business
illustration
illustration
so
everybody
was
pleased
when
sally
henny
penny
sent
out
a
printed
poster
to
say
that
she
was
going
to
the
shop
henny
opening
sale
grand
jumble
penny
penny
prices
come
buy
come
try
come
buy
the
poster
really
was
most
illustration
there
was
a
rush
upon
the
opening
day
the
shop
was
crammed
with
customers
and
there
were
crowds
of
mice
upon
the
biscuit
canisters
sally
henny
penny
gets
rather
flustered
when
she
tries
to
count
out
change
and
she
insists
on
being
paid
cash
but
she
is
quite
harmless
illustration
and
she
has
laid
in
a
remarkable
assortment
of
bargains
there
is
something
to
please
everybody
