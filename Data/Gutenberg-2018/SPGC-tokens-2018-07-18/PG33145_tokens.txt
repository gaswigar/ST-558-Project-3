come
out
of
the
kitchen
i
the
window
of
randolph
reed
office
was
almost
completely
covered
by
magnificent
gold
block
lettering
this
to
any
one
who
had
time
and
ability
to
read
it
and
the
former
was
more
common
in
the
community
than
the
latter
conveyed
the
information
that
reed
dealt
in
every
kind
of
real
estate
from
country
palaces
to
city
flats
the
last
item
was
put
in
more
for
the
sake
of
symmetry
than
accuracy
for
the
small
southern
town
contained
nothing
approaching
an
apartment
house
from
behind
this
pattern
of
gold
reed
peered
eagerly
one
autumn
afternoon
chewing
the
end
of
a
frayed
cigar
and
listening
for
the
sound
of
a
motor
he
was
a
stout
young
man
of
an
amiable
though
unreadable
countenance
but
like
many
people
of
a
heavy
build
he
was
capable
of
extreme
quickness
of
movement
this
was
never
more
clearly
shown
than
when
about
four
the
wished
for
sound
actually
reached
his
ears
a
motor
was
approaching
with
a
bound
reed
left
the
window
and
seated
at
his
desk
presented
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
appearance
of
a
young
american
business
man
calm
and
efficient
on
an
afternoon
of
unusual
business
pressure
he
laid
papers
in
piles
put
them
in
clips
and
took
them
out
snapped
rubber
bands
about
them
with
frenzied
haste
and
finally
seizing
a
pen
he
began
to
indite
those
and
thrilling
words
dear
sir
yours
of
the
instant
received
and
contents
when
the
motor
drew
up
before
his
door
it
was
an
english
car
all
green
and
nickel
it
moved
like
an
expert
skater
on
perfect
ice
as
it
stopped
the
chauffeur
dropped
from
his
place
beside
the
driver
the
driver
himself
removing
his
glasses
sprang
from
the
car
and
up
the
office
steps
slapping
the
pockets
of
his
coat
as
he
did
so
in
a
search
which
soon
appeared
to
be
for
cigarettes
and
matches
sorry
to
be
late
he
said
reed
who
had
looked
up
as
one
who
did
not
at
once
remember
in
his
vast
preoccupation
either
his
visitor
or
his
business
now
seemed
to
recall
everything
he
waved
the
newcomer
to
a
chair
with
a
splendid
gesture
doubtless
the
roads
he
began
roads
said
the
other
no
we
left
washington
later
than
i
intended
well
have
you
got
the
house
for
me
reed
offered
his
client
a
cigar
no
thank
you
prefer
my
cigarette
if
you
do
mind
reed
did
not
mind
in
the
least
the
real
estate
business
in
vestalia
was
never
brilliant
and
several
weeks
profits
might
easily
have
been
expended
in
one
friendly
smoke
his
client
was
a
man
under
thirty
of
a
type
that
used
to
be
considered
typically
american
that
is
to
say
modified
by
a
century
or
so
of
new
england
climate
and
conscience
his
ancestors
had
been
sailors
perhaps
and
years
of
exposure
had
tanned
their
skins
and
left
their
eyes
as
blue
as
ever
his
movements
had
the
gentleness
characteristic
of
men
who
are
much
with
horses
and
though
he
was
active
and
rather
lightly
built
he
never
was
sudden
or
jerky
in
any
gesture
something
of
this
same
quietness
might
be
detected
in
his
mental
attitude
people
sometimes
thought
him
hesitating
or
undecided
on
questions
about
which
his
mind
was
irrevocably
made
up
he
took
a
certain
friendly
interest
in
life
as
a
whole
and
would
listen
with
such
patience
to
an
expression
of
opinion
that
the
expresser
of
it
was
often
surprised
to
find
the
opinion
had
had
no
weight
with
him
whatsoever
he
stood
now
listening
with
the
politest
attention
to
reed
somewhat
flowery
description
of
the
charms
of
the
revelly
house
charms
which
crane
himself
had
examined
in
the
minutest
detail
never
before
exclaimed
the
real
estate
agent
in
a
magnificent
peroration
never
before
has
the
splendid
mansion
been
rented
ah
said
crane
with
a
smile
i
believe
you
there
never
been
offered
for
rent
corrected
the
real
estate
agent
with
a
cough
its
delightful
colonial
flavor
its
confounded
dilapidation
said
the
prospective
tenant
its
boxwood
garden
its
splendid
lawns
its
stables
accommodating
horses
yes
if
they
do
lean
up
against
the
sides
reed
frowned
if
he
remarked
with
a
touch
of
pride
you
do
not
want
the
house
the
young
man
of
the
motor
car
laughed
i
thought
we
had
settled
all
that
last
week
he
said
i
do
want
the
house
i
do
appreciate
its
beauties
i
do
not
consider
it
in
good
repair
and
i
continue
to
think
that
the
price
for
six
weeks
is
very
high
have
the
owners
come
down
reed
frowned
again
i
thought
i
made
it
clear
on
my
part
he
answered
that
and
revelly
are
beyond
the
reach
of
communication
they
are
on
their
way
to
madeira
before
they
left
they
set
the
price
on
their
house
and
i
can
only
follow
their
instructions
their
children
there
are
four
children
good
heavens
i
do
have
to
rent
them
with
the
house
do
i
exclaimed
the
other
frivolously
the
real
estate
agent
colored
probably
from
annoyance
no
crane
he
answered
proudly
you
do
not
as
far
as
i
know
have
to
do
anything
you
do
not
wish
to
do
what
i
was
about
to
say
was
that
the
children
have
no
authority
to
alter
the
price
determined
by
their
parents
to
my
mind
however
it
is
not
a
question
of
absolute
value
there
is
no
doubt
that
you
can
find
newer
and
more
conveniently
appointed
houses
in
the
hunting
district
certainly
cheaper
ones
if
price
be
such
an
object
but
the
revelly
family
one
of
the
most
aristocratic
families
south
of
mason
and
dixon
sir
would
not
be
induced
to
consider
renting
under
the
sum
originally
named
it
pretty
steep
said
the
young
man
but
his
mild
tone
already
betrayed
him
and
how
about
servants
ah
said
reed
looking
particularly
servants
that
has
been
the
great
difficulty
to
guarantee
domestic
service
that
will
satisfy
your
difficult
northern
standards
i
am
fussy
about
only
two
things
said
crane
cooking
and
boots
must
have
my
boots
properly
done
if
you
could
have
brought
your
own
valet
but
i
told
you
he
has
typhoid
fever
now
see
here
reed
there
really
is
any
use
wasting
my
time
and
yours
if
you
have
not
been
able
to
get
me
a
staff
of
servants
with
the
house
i
would
dream
of
taking
it
i
thought
we
had
made
that
clear
reed
waved
his
impatient
client
again
to
his
chair
there
are
at
this
moment
four
servants
yonder
in
the
back
office
waiting
to
be
interviewed
by
me
exclaimed
crane
looking
slightly
alarmed
reed
bowed
i
wish
first
however
he
went
on
to
say
a
word
or
two
about
them
i
obtained
them
with
the
greatest
difficulty
from
the
of
whom
you
have
doubtless
often
heard
never
in
my
life
said
crane
reed
raised
his
eyebrows
he
is
one
of
our
most
distinguished
citizens
his
collection
of
tapestry
his
villa
at
capri
ah
well
but
that
is
immaterial
the
family
is
now
abroad
and
has
in
consequence
consented
as
a
personal
favor
to
me
to
allow
you
to
take
over
four
of
their
servants
for
the
six
weeks
you
will
be
here
but
not
a
minute
longer
crane
leaned
back
and
blew
smoke
in
the
air
are
they
any
good
he
asked
you
must
judge
for
yourself
no
you
must
tell
me
the
butler
is
a
competent
person
the
skill
of
the
cook
is
a
proverb
but
we
had
better
have
them
come
in
and
speak
to
you
themselves
no
by
jove
cried
crane
springing
to
his
feet
i
do
think
i
could
stand
that
and
he
incontinently
rushed
from
the
office
to
the
motor
where
three
figures
on
the
back
seat
had
remained
immovable
during
his
absence
of
these
two
were
female
and
one
male
to
the
elder
of
the
women
crane
applied
hat
in
hand
wo
you
give
me
the
benefit
of
your
advice
falkener
he
said
the
agent
has
some
servants
for
me
the
wages
and
everything
like
that
have
all
been
arranged
but
would
you
mind
just
looking
them
over
for
me
and
telling
me
what
you
think
about
them
to
invite
falkener
to
give
her
advice
on
a
detail
of
household
management
was
like
inviting
a
duck
to
the
pond
she
stepped
with
a
dignity
from
the
car
she
was
a
commanding
woman
who
swam
through
life
borne
up
by
her
belief
in
her
own
infallibility
to
be
just
she
was
very
nearly
infallible
in
matters
of
comfort
and
domestic
arrangement
and
it
was
now
many
years
since
she
had
given
attention
to
anything
else
in
the
world
she
was
a
thorough
able
and
woman
of
now
she
moved
into
reed
office
with
and
dusters
floating
about
her
like
a
solid
wingless
victory
and
sat
down
in
randolph
reed
own
chair
it
was
part
of
her
philosophy
never
to
interview
a
social
inferior
until
she
herself
was
seated
with
a
slight
gesture
of
her
gloved
hand
she
indicated
that
the
servants
might
be
admitted
to
her
presence
the
door
to
the
back
office
opened
and
the
four
candidates
entered
the
first
was
the
butler
a
man
slightly
younger
in
years
than
most
of
those
careworn
functionaries
he
came
forward
with
a
quick
rapid
step
turning
his
feet
out
and
walking
on
his
toes
only
falkener
recognized
that
it
was
the
walk
of
a
perfect
butler
she
would
have
engaged
him
on
the
spot
but
when
she
noted
that
his
hair
was
parted
from
forehead
back
to
the
line
of
his
collar
and
brushed
slightly
forward
in
front
of
his
ears
she
experienced
a
feeling
of
envy
and
for
the
first
time
thought
with
dissatisfaction
of
the
paragon
she
had
left
in
charge
of
her
own
pantry
at
home
she
did
indeed
ask
him
a
question
or
two
just
to
assure
herself
of
his
english
intonation
which
it
must
be
owned
a
residence
in
the
south
had
slightly
influenced
and
then
with
a
start
she
passed
on
to
the
next
figure
the
cook
on
her
the
eyes
of
her
future
employer
had
already
been
fixed
since
the
door
first
opened
and
it
would
be
hardly
possible
to
exaggerate
the
effect
produced
by
her
appearance
she
might
have
stepped
from
a
keepsake
or
book
of
beauty
she
should
have
worn
eternally
a
crinoline
and
a
wreath
of
flowers
her
soft
eyes
her
little
bowed
mouth
her
slim
throat
should
have
been
the
subject
of
a
perpetual
steel
engraving
she
was
small
and
light
of
bone
and
her
hands
crossed
upon
her
check
apron
for
she
was
in
her
working
dress
were
so
little
and
soft
that
they
seemed
hardly
capable
of
lifting
a
pot
or
kettle
falkener
expressed
the
general
sentiment
exactly
when
she
gasped
and
you
are
the
cook
the
cook
whose
eyes
had
been
decorously
fixed
upon
the
floor
now
raised
them
and
sweeping
one
rapid
glance
across
both
her
employer
and
the
speaker
whispered
discreetly
yes
what
is
your
name
and
at
this
question
a
curious
thing
happened
the
butler
and
reed
answered
simultaneously
only
the
butler
said
jane
and
reed
with
equal
conviction
said
ellen
ignoring
this
seeming
contradiction
the
cook
fixed
her
glance
on
falkener
and
answered
my
name
is
it
was
impossible
for
even
as
conscientious
a
housekeeper
as
falkener
to
be
really
severe
with
so
gentle
a
creature
but
she
contrived
to
say
with
a
certain
sternness
i
should
like
to
see
your
references
oh
i
sure
that
will
be
all
right
falkener
said
crane
hastily
he
had
never
removed
his
eyes
from
the
face
of
his
future
cook
but
with
soft
gestures
of
those
ridiculous
hands
was
already
unfolding
a
paper
and
now
handed
it
to
falkener
that
lady
took
it
and
held
it
off
at
arm
length
while
she
read
it
and
who
she
asked
turning
to
reed
is
this
claudia
revelly
revelly
i
suppose
why
no
answered
reed
no
as
i
told
you
revelly
is
in
madeira
with
her
husband
this
is
one
of
the
miss
revellys
humph
replied
falkener
it
is
a
flattering
reference
but
in
my
time
the
word
was
spelled
with
only
one
the
cook
colored
slightly
and
flashed
a
glance
that
might
have
been
interpreted
as
reproachful
at
reed
who
said
hastily
ah
yes
quite
so
you
know
the
fact
is
our
southern
aristocracy
the
revellys
are
among
our
very
however
there
can
be
no
question
whatever
about
ability
you
will
i
can
assure
you
from
personal
experience
be
satisfied
with
her
cooking
humph
said
falkener
again
as
one
who
does
not
mean
to
commit
herself
we
shall
see
let
the
housemaid
come
a
little
forward
at
this
a
young
woman
advanced
she
bore
a
certain
resemblance
of
feature
to
the
butler
but
entirely
lacked
his
competent
alertness
this
young
woman
looks
to
me
sullen
falkener
observed
to
crane
hardly
modulating
her
clear
dry
tone
of
voice
crane
betrayed
his
embarrassment
he
wished
now
that
he
had
not
invited
his
elderly
friend
coöperation
oh
he
said
i
sure
it
will
be
all
right
it
must
be
a
trifle
annoying
to
be
looked
over
like
this
the
best
way
to
settle
this
sort
of
thing
is
at
the
start
replied
falkener
and
turning
to
the
housemaid
she
asked
her
her
name
lily
replied
the
young
woman
in
a
deep
voice
of
annoyance
lily
said
falkener
as
if
this
were
a
most
unsuitable
name
for
a
housemaid
and
she
looked
up
at
crane
to
confirm
her
opinion
but
he
was
again
looking
at
the
cook
and
did
not
notice
her
well
lily
continued
the
elder
lady
as
if
she
made
a
distinct
concession
in
making
use
of
such
a
name
at
all
in
addressing
a
servant
do
you
or
do
you
not
want
to
take
this
place
there
is
i
suppose
nothing
to
compel
you
to
take
it
if
you
do
not
want
but
now
is
the
time
to
say
so
lily
with
a
manner
that
did
seem
a
little
ungracious
replied
that
she
did
want
it
and
added
on
receiving
a
quick
glance
from
the
butler
smithfield
madame
well
then
said
falkener
becoming
more
condescending
we
shall
expect
a
more
pleasant
demeanor
from
you
a
spirit
of
coöperation
nothing
is
more
trying
for
yourself
or
your
fellow
servants
reed
moved
forward
and
whispered
in
falkener
ear
it
will
straighten
out
of
itself
my
dear
madame
nothing
but
a
little
embarrassment
a
like
yourself
you
understand
me
a
tremendous
impression
on
a
young
woman
of
this
sort
falkener
interrupted
him
what
is
the
name
of
the
boy
in
the
corner
she
asked
at
this
a
lad
of
perhaps
eighteen
sprang
forward
the
most
striking
items
of
his
costume
were
a
red
neckerchief
and
a
green
baize
apron
and
leggings
giving
to
his
appearance
a
slight
flavor
of
a
in
an
illustration
to
dickens
i
he
said
with
a
strong
cockney
accent
am
the
useful
boy
as
they
say
in
the
states
he
very
good
at
doing
boots
said
reed
boots
cried
the
boy
and
kissing
his
hand
he
waved
it
in
the
air
with
a
gesture
we
have
been
accustomed
to
think
of
as
continental
rather
than
british
a
boot
particularly
a
is
to
me
what
is
your
name
falkener
asked
and
this
time
the
severity
of
her
manner
was
unmistakable
it
did
not
however
dampen
the
enthusiasm
of
the
last
candidate
my
name
he
replied
is
brindlebury
pronounced
the
old
sussex
name
with
which
i
have
no
doubt
you
as
a
student
of
history
falkener
turned
to
crane
i
think
you
will
have
trouble
with
that
boy
she
said
he
is
inclined
to
be
impertinent
crane
looked
at
the
boy
over
her
head
and
the
boy
out
of
a
pair
of
twinkling
gray
eyes
looked
back
they
both
managed
to
look
away
again
before
a
smile
had
been
actually
exchanged
but
crane
found
himself
making
use
for
the
third
time
of
his
favorite
formula
oh
i
think
i
find
him
all
right
falkener
remembering
the
pitiable
weakness
of
men
again
waved
her
hand
they
may
go
now
she
said
to
reed
who
hastily
shepherded
the
four
back
again
into
the
back
office
when
they
were
alone
she
turned
to
crane
and
said
with
the
utmost
conviction
my
dear
burton
none
of
those
servants
will
do
except
the
butler
who
appears
to
be
a
thoroughly
competent
person
but
those
young
women
they
may
have
been
anything
did
you
not
observe
that
their
nails
had
been
manicured
crane
stammered
slightly
for
the
fact
had
not
escaped
him
in
connection
at
least
with
one
of
the
young
women
do
do
cooks
ever
manicure
their
nails
he
said
it
seems
rather
a
good
idea
to
me
reed
who
was
once
more
approaching
caught
these
last
words
ah
he
said
you
were
speaking
of
the
manicuring
of
nails
falkener
gave
him
a
severe
look
i
was
advising
crane
not
to
engage
any
one
but
the
butler
indeed
how
very
interesting
said
reed
your
judgment
in
the
matter
is
very
valuable
madame
i
know
but
perhaps
you
do
not
sufficiently
emphasize
the
difficulties
of
getting
any
servants
at
all
in
this
part
of
the
country
in
fact
i
could
not
undertake
if
these
are
not
engaged
well
i
could
said
the
lady
i
could
telegraph
to
new
york
to
my
own
intelligence
office
and
have
three
really
competent
people
here
by
evening
for
a
moment
reed
looked
profoundly
distressed
and
then
he
went
on
exactly
i
have
no
doubt
madame
but
what
i
was
about
to
say
was
that
i
could
not
undertake
to
rent
the
revelly
house
to
a
staff
of
unknown
northern
servants
you
see
these
two
young
women
have
been
practically
brought
up
in
the
household
of
an
old
family
friend
of
the
revellys
and
they
know
they
would
take
care
of
things
in
the
way
they
are
accustomed
to
of
course
of
course
very
natural
said
crane
i
quite
agree
willing
to
give
these
people
a
chance
of
course
falkener
i
do
know
as
much
about
these
things
as
you
do
but
it
only
for
a
few
weeks
and
as
for
their
nails
oh
i
can
explain
that
cried
reed
in
fact
i
should
have
done
so
at
the
start
it
an
idiosyncrasy
of
billington
he
insists
that
all
the
servants
in
the
house
should
be
manicured
particularly
those
who
wait
on
table
or
have
anything
to
do
with
touching
the
food
falkener
compressed
her
lips
till
they
were
nothing
but
a
seam
in
her
face
humph
she
said
again
and
without
another
word
she
turned
and
swept
out
of
the
office
left
alone
the
two
men
stood
silent
without
even
looking
at
each
other
and
finally
it
was
crane
who
observed
mildly
well
you
know
they
are
a
little
queer
in
some
ways
take
my
word
for
it
said
reed
earnestly
you
will
make
no
mistake
in
engaging
them
all
except
that
boy
but
you
can
manage
him
i
have
no
doubt
as
for
the
cook
you
will
be
surprised
her
cooking
is
famous
in
three
counties
i
assure
you
an
instant
later
the
lease
was
duly
signed
when
the
motor
was
safely
on
its
way
back
to
washington
falkener
gave
her
companions
on
the
back
seat
the
benefit
of
her
own
impression
one
was
her
daughter
a
muscular
girl
who
imagined
that
she
had
thoroughly
emancipated
herself
from
her
mother
dominance
because
she
had
established
a
different
field
of
interest
she
loved
sport
of
all
kinds
particularly
hunting
and
was
as
keen
and
competent
about
them
as
her
mother
was
about
household
management
the
two
respected
each
other
abilities
and
managed
to
lead
an
affectionate
life
in
common
the
man
on
the
back
seat
was
solon
tucker
crane
lawyer
by
inheritance
rather
than
by
choice
he
was
a
thin
erect
man
with
a
narrow
head
and
that
expression
of
mouth
at
once
hard
and
subtle
that
the
law
writes
on
so
many
men
faces
his
mind
was
excellently
clear
his
manner
reserved
and
his
invariable
presupposition
that
all
human
beings
except
himself
were
likely
to
make
fools
of
themselves
he
had
however
immense
respect
for
falkener
opinions
on
any
subject
except
law
on
which
he
respected
nobody
opinions
but
his
own
least
of
all
those
of
judges
and
he
believed
that
nothing
would
so
effectively
lighten
his
own
responsibilities
in
regard
to
crane
as
to
marry
him
to
falkener
daughter
an
idea
in
which
falkener
cordially
agreed
you
must
make
a
point
of
staying
with
him
solon
she
was
now
murmuring
into
that
gentleman
rather
large
ear
if
as
i
fear
he
actually
takes
this
house
you
have
never
seen
such
an
extraordinary
group
of
servants
except
the
butler
do
you
suppose
it
could
be
a
plot
a
blackmailing
scheme
of
some
sort
the
cook
well
my
dear
solon
a
pocket
venus
a
stage
ingénue
with
manicured
nails
he
was
determined
to
engage
her
from
the
first
it
seems
very
unsafe
to
me
a
bachelor
of
burton
means
you
must
stay
by
him
solon
in
fact
she
added
i
think
we
had
better
both
stay
by
him
poor
boy
he
has
no
idea
of
taking
care
of
himself
he
can
be
very
obstinate
said
his
lawyer
but
i
fancy
you
exaggerate
the
dangers
you
are
unaccustomed
to
any
but
the
very
highest
type
of
english
servant
they
are
probably
nothing
worse
than
incompetent
wait
till
you
see
the
cook
answered
falkener
portentously
tucker
looked
away
over
the
darkening
landscape
dear
me
he
thought
to
himself
what
a
mountain
she
makes
of
a
how
every
one
exaggerates
except
trained
minds
in
tucker
opinion
all
trained
minds
were
legal
ii
on
the
following
monday
late
in
the
afternoon
the
old
revelly
house
was
awaiting
its
new
master
already
hunters
ponies
carts
an
extra
motor
to
say
nothing
of
grooms
and
a
tremendous
head
coachman
had
arrived
and
were
making
the
stable
yards
resound
as
they
had
not
done
for
seventy
years
but
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
household
staff
they
were
all
to
be
boarded
by
the
coachman
wife
who
was
installed
in
the
gardener
cottage
the
house
with
its
tall
pillared
portico
and
flat
roofed
wings
lost
its
shabby
air
as
the
afternoon
light
grew
dimmer
and
by
six
when
crane
motor
drew
up
before
the
door
it
presented
nothing
but
a
dignified
and
spacious
mass
to
his
admiring
eyes
no
one
but
tucker
was
with
him
he
had
had
some
difficulty
in
avoiding
the
pressing
desire
of
the
two
falkener
ladies
to
be
with
him
at
the
start
and
help
him
as
they
put
it
get
everything
in
order
he
had
displayed
however
a
firmness
that
they
had
not
expected
he
had
been
more
embarrassed
than
he
cared
to
remember
by
falkener
assistance
in
the
real
estate
office
and
he
decided
to
begin
his
new
housekeeping
without
her
advice
he
would
indeed
have
dispensed
with
the
companionship
even
of
tucker
for
a
day
or
two
but
that
would
have
been
impossible
without
a
direct
refusal
and
burton
was
unwilling
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
so
true
and
loyal
a
friend
not
only
of
his
own
but
of
his
father
before
him
the
dignified
butler
and
the
irrepressible
boy
brindlebury
ran
down
the
steps
to
meet
them
and
certainly
they
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
their
treatment
bags
were
carried
up
and
unstrapped
baths
drawn
clothes
laid
out
with
the
most
praiseworthy
promptness
tucker
had
advocated
a
preliminary
tour
of
inspection
it
is
most
important
he
murmured
to
crane
to
give
these
people
the
idea
from
the
start
that
you
can
not
be
deceived
or
imposed
upon
but
crane
refused
even
to
consider
such
questions
until
he
had
had
a
bath
and
dinner
the
plan
of
the
old
house
was
very
simple
on
the
right
of
the
front
door
was
the
on
the
left
a
small
library
and
a
room
which
had
evidently
been
used
as
an
office
the
stairs
went
up
in
the
center
shallow
and
broad
winding
about
a
square
well
the
ran
across
the
back
of
the
house
when
tucker
came
down
dressed
for
dinner
he
found
crane
was
ahead
of
him
he
was
standing
in
the
bending
so
intently
over
something
on
a
table
that
tucker
who
was
not
entirely
without
curiosity
came
and
bent
over
it
too
and
even
the
butler
who
had
come
to
announce
dinner
craned
his
neck
in
that
direction
it
was
a
miniature
set
in
an
frame
of
gold
and
pearls
it
represented
a
young
woman
in
a
mauve
tulle
ball
dress
full
in
the
skirt
and
cut
off
the
shoulders
as
was
the
fashion
in
the
days
before
the
war
she
wore
a
wreath
of
fuchsias
one
of
which
trailing
down
just
touched
her
bare
shoulder
well
said
tucker
contemptuously
you
do
consider
that
a
work
of
art
do
you
burton
remained
as
one
entranced
it
reminds
me
of
some
one
i
know
he
answered
it
is
quite
obviously
a
fancy
picture
replied
tucker
who
was
something
of
a
connoisseur
look
at
those
upturned
eyes
and
that
hand
did
you
ever
see
a
live
woman
with
such
a
tiny
hand
yes
once
said
crane
but
his
guest
did
not
notice
him
the
sentimentality
of
the
art
of
that
period
tucker
continued
which
is
so
plainly
manifested
in
the
poetry
beg
pardon
sir
said
smithfield
the
soup
is
served
crane
reluctantly
tore
himself
from
the
picture
and
sat
down
at
table
and
such
is
the
materialism
of
our
day
that
he
was
evidently
immediately
compensated
by
jove
he
said
what
a
capital
purée
even
tucker
who
under
falkener
tuition
had
intended
to
find
the
food
uneatable
was
obliged
to
confess
its
merits
i
say
said
crane
to
smithfield
tell
the
cook
will
you
that
i
never
tasted
such
a
soup
not
out
of
paris
or
even
in
it
she
probably
never
heard
of
paris
put
in
tucker
smithfield
bowed
i
will
explain
your
meaning
to
her
sir
he
said
dinner
continued
on
the
same
high
plane
ending
with
two
perfect
cups
of
coffee
which
called
forth
such
eulogies
from
crane
that
tucker
said
finally
as
they
left
the
upon
my
word
burt
i
never
knew
you
cared
so
much
about
eating
i
love
art
tuck
said
the
other
slapping
his
friend
on
the
back
i
appreciate
perfection
i
worship
genius
tucker
began
to
feel
sincerely
distressed
indeed
he
lay
awake
for
hours
worrying
he
had
counted
from
falkener
description
on
finding
the
servants
so
incompetent
that
the
house
would
be
impossible
he
had
hoped
that
one
dinner
would
have
been
enough
to
send
crane
to
the
telegraph
office
of
his
own
accord
summoning
servants
from
the
north
he
had
almost
promised
falkener
that
when
she
and
her
daughter
arrived
the
next
afternoon
they
would
find
a
new
staff
expected
if
not
actually
installed
instead
he
would
have
to
greet
her
with
the
news
that
the
pocket
venus
with
the
polished
nails
had
turned
out
to
be
a
that
is
if
she
were
really
doing
the
cooking
perhaps
this
idea
occurred
to
tucker
shortly
before
dawn
perhaps
she
was
just
pretending
to
cook
perhaps
she
had
hired
some
excellent
old
black
mammy
to
do
the
real
work
that
should
be
easily
discoverable
he
determined
to
learn
the
truth
and
on
this
resolution
fell
asleep
the
consequence
was
that
he
came
down
to
breakfast
rather
cross
and
would
even
answer
crane
who
was
in
the
most
genial
temper
when
he
commented
favorably
on
the
omelette
in
fact
he
let
it
appear
that
this
constant
preoccupation
with
material
details
was
distasteful
to
him
crane
as
he
rose
from
the
table
turned
to
smithfield
will
you
tell
the
cook
i
like
to
see
her
he
said
i
expecting
some
ladies
to
stay
this
afternoon
and
i
want
to
make
things
comfortable
for
them
be
off
tuck
there
a
good
fellow
if
this
sort
of
thing
bores
you
but
wild
horses
would
not
at
that
moment
have
dragged
tucker
away
and
he
observed
that
he
supposed
there
was
no
objection
to
his
finishing
his
breakfast
where
he
was
smithfield
coughed
i
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
he
said
but
if
you
could
tell
me
what
it
is
you
want
i
would
tell
the
cook
she
has
a
peculiar
nature
has
sir
has
had
from
a
child
and
if
you
would
forgive
the
liberty
i
believe
it
would
be
best
for
you
not
to
interview
her
yourself
tucker
looked
up
quickly
why
what
do
you
mean
asked
crane
she
is
very
timid
sir
very
easily
affected
by
criticism
good
heavens
i
do
want
to
criticize
her
cried
crane
i
only
want
to
tell
her
how
highly
i
think
of
her
in
my
opinion
burton
tucker
began
when
an
incident
occurred
that
entirely
changed
the
situation
a
very
large
elderly
gray
cat
walked
into
the
room
with
the
step
of
one
who
has
always
been
welcome
and
approaching
tucker
chair
as
if
it
were
a
familiar
place
he
jumped
suddenly
upon
his
knee
and
began
to
purr
in
his
face
tucker
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
was
not
at
his
best
in
the
early
morning
later
in
the
day
he
might
have
borne
such
an
occurrence
with
more
calm
but
before
ten
he
was
like
a
man
without
armor
against
such
attacks
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
an
exclamation
and
drove
the
cat
ahead
of
him
from
the
room
returning
alone
an
instant
later
it
is
outrageous
he
said
when
he
returned
that
our
lives
are
to
be
rendered
miserable
by
that
filthy
beast
sit
down
tuck
said
burton
who
was
talking
about
wines
with
the
butler
my
life
is
not
rendered
in
the
least
miserable
the
champagne
smithfield
ought
to
go
on
the
ice
tucker
however
could
not
distract
his
mind
so
quickly
from
the
thought
of
the
outrage
to
which
he
had
just
been
subjected
i
must
really
ask
you
burton
he
said
before
you
go
on
with
your
orders
to
insist
that
that
animal
be
drowned
or
at
least
sent
out
of
the
house
oh
i
beg
sir
that
you
wo
do
that
broke
in
smithfield
the
cat
belongs
to
the
cook
and
i
really
could
not
say
sir
what
she
might
do
if
the
cat
were
put
out
of
the
house
we
seem
to
hear
a
vast
amount
about
what
this
cook
likes
and
like
said
tucker
dribbling
a
little
more
hot
milk
into
his
half
cup
of
coffee
the
house
i
believe
is
not
run
entirely
for
her
convenience
it
is
possible
that
crane
had
already
been
rendered
slightly
inimical
to
his
friend
point
of
view
but
he
was
saved
the
trouble
of
answering
him
for
at
this
moment
the
cook
herself
entered
the
room
in
what
no
one
present
doubted
for
an
instant
was
a
towering
rage
she
was
wearing
a
sky
blue
gingham
dress
her
eyes
were
shining
frightfully
and
her
cheeks
were
very
pink
at
the
sight
of
her
all
conversation
died
away
the
butler
approaching
her
attempted
to
draw
her
aside
murmuring
something
to
which
she
paid
no
attention
no
she
said
aloud
pulling
her
arm
away
from
his
restraining
hand
i
will
not
go
away
and
leave
it
to
you
i
will
not
stay
in
any
house
where
dumb
animals
are
least
of
all
my
own
dear
cat
it
is
as
most
of
us
know
to
our
cost
easier
to
be
pompous
than
dignified
when
one
feels
oneself
in
the
wrong
pooh
said
tucker
your
cat
was
not
she
had
no
business
in
the
he
was
kicked
said
the
cook
come
my
girl
returned
tucker
this
is
not
the
way
to
speak
to
your
employer
and
at
this
with
one
of
those
complete
changes
of
manner
so
disconcerting
in
the
weaker
sex
the
cook
turned
to
crane
and
said
with
the
most
melting
gentleness
i
sure
it
was
not
you
sir
i
am
sure
you
would
not
do
such
a
thing
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
was
disrespectful
but
perhaps
you
know
if
you
have
ever
loved
an
animal
how
you
feel
to
see
it
brutally
kicked
downstairs
preposterous
said
tucker
carefully
indicating
that
he
was
addressing
crane
alone
this
is
all
preposterous
tell
the
woman
to
keep
her
cat
where
it
belongs
and
we
have
no
more
trouble
it
has
troubled
me
tuck
answered
crane
cheerfully
but
i
am
curious
to
know
whether
or
not
you
did
kick
him
the
question
seems
to
be
do
you
allow
your
servants
to
be
insolent
or
not
crane
turned
to
the
cook
tucker
seems
unwilling
to
commit
himself
on
the
subject
of
the
kick
he
observed
have
you
any
reason
for
supposing
your
cat
was
kicked
yes
said
the
noise
the
scuffle
the
bad
language
and
the
way
willoughby
ran
into
the
kitchen
with
his
tail
as
big
as
a
fox
he
is
not
a
cat
to
make
a
fuss
about
nothing
i
can
tell
you
i
beg
your
pardon
said
crane
who
was
now
evidently
enjoying
himself
but
what
did
you
say
the
cat
name
is
willoughby
burton
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
willoughby
he
exclaimed
how
perfectly
delightful
now
you
must
own
tuck
prejudiced
as
you
are
that
that
the
best
cat
name
you
ever
heard
in
your
life
but
tucker
would
not
or
could
not
respond
to
this
overture
and
so
crane
looked
back
at
who
looked
at
him
and
said
oh
do
you
like
that
name
i
so
glad
sir
and
at
this
they
smiled
at
each
other
do
you
think
you
had
better
go
back
to
the
kitchen
said
the
butler
sternly
in
the
meantime
tucker
had
lighted
a
cigar
and
had
slightly
recovered
his
equanimity
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
now
said
in
a
deep
growling
voice
i
did
not
kick
the
creature
at
all
though
if
i
had
i
should
have
considered
myself
fully
justified
i
merely
assisted
its
progress
down
the
kitchen
stairs
with
a
sort
of
push
with
my
foot
it
was
a
kick
to
willoughby
said
the
cook
in
spite
of
a
quick
effort
on
smithfield
part
to
keep
her
quiet
o
tuck
cried
crane
it
takes
a
lawyer
does
it
to
distinguish
between
a
kick
and
an
assisting
push
with
the
foot
well
he
went
on
turning
to
her
i
think
it
not
too
much
to
ask
that
willoughby
be
kept
in
the
kitchen
hereafter
i
sure
he
has
no
wish
to
go
where
he
not
wanted
she
replied
proudly
and
at
this
instant
willoughby
entered
exactly
as
before
all
four
watched
him
in
a
sort
of
hypnotic
inactivity
as
before
he
walked
with
a
slow
firm
step
to
the
chair
in
which
tucker
sat
and
as
before
jumped
upon
his
knee
but
this
time
tucker
did
not
move
he
only
looked
at
willoughby
and
sneered
with
the
gesture
of
a
mother
rescuing
an
innocent
babe
from
massacre
sprang
forward
and
snatched
the
cat
up
in
her
arms
then
she
turned
on
her
heel
and
left
the
room
as
she
did
so
the
face
of
willoughby
over
her
shoulder
distinctly
grinned
at
the
discomfited
tucker
not
unnaturally
tucker
took
what
he
could
from
the
situation
if
i
were
you
burt
he
said
i
should
get
rid
of
that
young
woman
she
is
not
a
suitable
cook
for
a
bachelor
establishment
she
too
pretty
and
she
knows
it
well
she
would
have
sense
enough
to
cook
so
well
if
she
know
it
it
seems
to
me
she
trades
on
her
looks
when
she
comes
up
here
and
makes
a
scene
like
this
beg
pardon
sir
said
smithfield
with
a
slightly
heightened
color
is
a
very
good
respectable
girl
certainly
she
is
said
crane
rising
nothing
could
be
more
obvious
just
run
down
smithfield
and
ask
her
to
send
up
a
menu
for
dinner
then
as
the
man
left
the
room
he
added
to
his
friend
sorry
tuck
if
i
seem
lacking
in
respect
for
you
and
your
wishes
but
i
really
could
dismiss
such
a
good
cook
because
you
think
her
a
little
bit
too
she
is
a
lovely
little
creature
she
illustration
sprang
forward
and
snatched
the
cat
from
tucker
knee
she
does
know
her
place
crane
walked
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
for
a
minute
and
then
he
said
thoughtfully
if
ever
i
have
a
cat
i
shall
name
it
willoughby
have
a
cat
cried
tucker
i
thought
you
detested
the
animals
as
much
as
i
do
i
felt
rather
attracted
toward
this
one
said
crane
iii
his
household
cares
disposed
of
crane
went
off
to
the
stables
it
was
a
soft
hazy
autumn
morning
and
though
he
walked
along
whistling
his
heart
was
heavy
these
changes
in
background
always
depressed
him
his
mother
had
been
dead
about
two
years
and
at
times
like
this
he
particularly
missed
her
she
had
always
contrived
to
make
domestic
difficulties
not
only
unimportant
but
amusing
she
had
been
pretty
and
young
both
in
years
and
spirit
and
had
had
the
determining
influence
on
her
son
since
his
childhood
his
parents
had
married
early
and
imprudently
the
elder
crane
stung
by
some
words
of
his
wife
family
had
resolved
from
the
first
to
make
a
successful
career
for
himself
shrewd
hard
and
determined
he
had
not
missed
his
mark
burton
earliest
recollections
of
him
were
fleeting
glimpses
of
a
white
tired
silent
man
seldom
it
seemed
to
him
at
home
and
by
his
gracious
absences
giving
him
burton
a
sort
of
prior
claim
on
all
the
time
and
all
the
attention
of
his
mother
as
he
grew
older
and
his
father
fortune
actually
materialized
he
began
to
see
that
it
had
never
given
pleasure
to
his
mother
that
it
had
first
taken
her
husband
time
and
strength
away
and
had
then
changed
the
very
stuff
out
of
which
the
man
was
made
he
had
grown
to
love
not
only
the
game
but
the
rewards
of
the
game
and
burton
knew
now
that
very
early
his
mother
had
begun
deliberately
to
teach
him
the
supreme
importance
of
human
relationships
that
she
had
somehow
inculcated
in
him
a
contempt
not
perhaps
for
money
but
for
those
who
valued
money
under
her
tuition
he
had
absorbed
a
point
of
view
not
very
usual
among
either
rich
or
poor
namely
that
money
like
good
health
was
excellent
to
have
chiefly
because
when
you
had
it
you
did
not
have
to
think
about
it
both
her
lessons
were
valuable
to
a
young
man
left
at
with
a
large
fortune
but
the
second
the
high
delight
in
companionship
she
had
taught
him
through
her
own
delightful
personality
and
her
death
left
him
desperately
lonely
his
loneliness
made
him
as
one
of
his
friends
had
said
extremely
open
to
the
dangers
of
matrimony
while
on
the
other
hand
he
had
been
rendered
highly
fastidious
by
his
years
of
happy
intimacy
with
his
mother
her
wit
and
good
temper
he
might
have
found
in
another
woman
even
possibly
her
concentrated
interest
in
himself
but
her
fortunate
sense
of
proportion
her
knowledge
in
life
as
to
what
was
trivial
and
what
was
essential
he
found
strangely
lacking
in
all
his
other
friends
he
thought
now
how
amusing
she
would
have
been
about
the
manicured
maid
servants
and
how
if
he
and
she
had
been
breakfasting
together
they
would
have
amused
themselves
by
inventing
fantastic
explanations
instead
of
quarreling
and
sulking
at
each
other
as
he
and
tucker
had
done
tucker
had
been
his
father
lawyer
it
had
been
one
of
the
many
contradictions
in
crane
character
that
though
she
had
always
insisted
that
as
a
matter
of
loyalty
to
her
husband
tucker
should
be
retained
as
family
adviser
she
had
never
been
able
to
conceal
from
burton
even
when
he
was
still
a
boy
that
she
considered
the
lawyer
an
intensely
comic
character
she
used
to
contrive
to
throw
a
world
of
significance
into
her
pronunciation
of
his
name
solon
crane
could
still
hear
her
saying
it
as
if
she
were
indeed
addressing
the
original
lawgiver
and
it
was
largely
because
this
recollection
was
too
vivid
that
he
himself
had
taken
to
calling
his
counselor
by
his
last
name
he
sighed
as
he
thought
of
all
this
but
he
was
a
young
man
the
day
was
fine
and
his
horses
an
absorbing
interest
and
so
he
spent
a
very
happy
morning
passing
his
hand
along
doubtful
fetlocks
and
withers
and
consulting
with
his
head
man
on
all
the
infinity
of
detail
which
constitutes
the
chief
joy
of
so
many
sports
at
lunch
he
appeared
to
be
interested
in
nothing
but
the
selection
of
the
best
mount
for
miss
falkener
a
state
of
mind
which
tucker
considered
a
great
deal
more
suitable
than
his
former
frivolous
interest
in
cats
and
soon
after
lunch
was
over
he
went
off
for
a
ride
so
as
to
get
it
in
before
he
had
to
go
and
meet
his
new
guests
a
back
piazza
ran
past
the
windows
it
was
shady
and
contained
a
long
the
november
afternoon
was
warm
and
here
tucker
decided
to
rest
possibly
to
sleep
in
order
to
recuperate
from
a
disturbing
night
and
morning
he
contrived
to
make
himself
very
comfortable
with
a
sofa
pillow
and
extra
overcoat
he
slept
indeed
so
long
that
when
he
woke
the
light
was
beginning
to
fade
he
lay
quiet
a
few
moments
thinking
that
falkener
would
soon
arrive
and
revolving
the
best
and
most
encouraging
terms
in
which
he
could
describe
the
situation
to
her
when
he
became
aware
of
voices
his
piazza
was
immediately
above
the
kitchen
door
and
it
was
clear
that
some
one
had
just
entered
the
kitchen
from
outdoors
and
he
heard
a
voice
unmistakably
say
stranger
see
how
glad
willoughby
is
to
see
you
again
just
think
he
has
laid
eyes
on
you
for
all
of
three
days
tucker
could
not
catch
the
answer
which
was
made
in
a
deep
masculine
voice
but
it
was
easy
to
guess
its
import
from
the
reply
of
oh
i
glad
to
see
you
too
another
murmur
how
do
you
expect
me
to
show
it
a
murmur
do
be
absurd
ranny
and
she
added
quite
audibly
if
you
really
want
proof
i
give
it
to
you
i
was
just
thinking
i
needed
some
one
to
help
me
freeze
the
give
it
a
turn
or
two
will
you
like
a
dear
it
was
obvious
that
the
visitor
was
of
a
docile
nature
for
presently
the
faint
regular
squeak
of
an
freezer
was
heard
his
heart
was
not
wholly
in
his
work
however
for
soon
he
began
to
complain
tucker
gathered
that
the
freezer
was
set
outside
the
kitchen
door
and
that
the
visitor
now
had
to
raise
his
voice
slightly
in
order
to
be
heard
in
the
kitchen
for
both
speakers
were
audible
yes
said
the
visitor
that
the
way
you
are
you
expect
every
one
to
work
for
you
do
you
enjoy
working
for
me
ranny
you
always
said
it
was
the
one
thing
in
the
world
gave
you
pleasure
humph
returned
the
other
grimly
i
do
know
that
i
am
so
eager
to
freeze
crane
and
tucker
do
forget
him
who
the
deuce
is
tucker
the
listener
above
sat
up
and
leaned
forward
eagerly
tucker
said
is
our
guest
at
present
he
my
favorite
and
willoughby
he
has
what
you
might
call
a
virile
dominating
personality
please
do
turn
so
fast
or
you
ruin
the
dessert
how
did
you
ever
come
in
contact
with
tucker
i
should
like
to
know
does
he
come
into
the
kitchen
not
yet
how
did
you
see
him
at
all
owing
to
his
kicking
willoughby
down
the
stairs
and
you
mean
to
say
you
stood
for
that
why
my
dear
girl
if
any
one
had
told
me
cruel
perhaps
ranny
but
the
action
of
a
strong
man
i
think
it
a
great
mistake
said
the
masculine
voice
in
a
tone
of
profound
displeasure
for
a
girl
situated
as
you
are
to
have
anything
to
do
with
her
employer
and
his
guests
what
do
you
know
about
these
fellows
how
old
is
this
tucker
oh
about
forty
i
should
think
the
listener
eyes
brightened
by
ten
years
what
does
he
look
like
oh
people
are
so
difficult
to
describe
ranny
you
can
describe
them
all
right
when
you
try
well
tucker
excitement
became
intense
well
he
looks
like
the
husband
on
the
stage
with
a
dash
of
powder
above
the
ears
who
wins
the
weak
young
wife
back
again
in
the
last
act
with
a
long
deep
breath
tucker
rose
to
his
feet
he
felt
like
a
different
man
a
strong
dangerous
fellow
dear
girl
said
the
masculine
voice
below
him
you
not
going
to
let
this
man
make
love
to
you
oh
ranny
he
never
tried
he
much
too
dignified
and
reserved
but
if
he
did
try
you
would
not
let
him
you
if
any
one
ought
to
know
that
it
is
always
easy
to
prevent
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
that
you
always
prevented
me
as
often
as
you
wanted
to
often
but
not
as
often
as
that
there
ranny
do
get
on
with
the
that
terrible
old
woman
is
coming
to
stay
this
evening
with
her
daughter
and
you
may
be
sure
she
have
us
all
turned
out
if
everything
is
just
right
crane
is
supposed
to
be
engaged
to
the
daughter
said
the
male
voice
well
i
do
envy
him
his
what
do
you
think
of
crane
there
was
a
pause
at
first
tucker
feared
he
might
have
missed
the
answer
but
presently
the
question
was
repeated
i
asked
you
what
you
thought
of
crane
oh
i
seen
a
good
many
young
men
of
that
type
in
my
time
was
the
reply
how
strange
women
are
remarked
the
maker
who
had
now
once
again
settled
down
to
work
i
should
have
thought
crane
just
the
man
to
attract
women
well
built
a
splendid
horseman
would
you
say
asked
the
cook
tucker
had
been
putting
exactly
the
same
question
to
himself
but
the
speaker
did
not
intend
to
answer
it
he
went
on
with
his
own
train
of
thought
and
here
you
go
into
raptures
over
an
old
fellow
old
enough
to
be
your
father
should
you
say
i
went
into
raptures
you
talk
as
if
you
were
prepared
to
make
an
idol
of
the
man
a
pleasant
laugh
greeted
this
statement
tucker
grew
grave
he
did
not
feel
that
he
thoroughly
understood
the
cause
of
that
laugh
but
he
took
refuge
in
that
comfortable
and
theory
that
women
were
fond
unaccountable
creatures
particularly
when
deeply
moved
another
explanation
was
offered
by
the
man
below
i
believe
you
are
just
trying
to
tease
me
ranny
you
know
very
well
you
can
always
do
whatever
you
like
with
me
the
voice
deepened
with
emotion
oh
dear
me
no
i
ca
why
not
i
ca
keep
you
turning
steadily
at
that
crank
here
let
me
show
you
how
it
ought
to
be
done
tucker
knew
that
she
had
come
out
of
the
kitchen
by
leaning
over
the
railing
he
could
see
the
kitchen
door
he
leant
over
the
space
before
the
entrance
was
paved
in
large
square
flagstones
here
an
freezer
was
standing
and
over
it
bent
a
young
man
of
a
somewhat
solid
build
but
with
the
unmistakable
manner
and
bearing
of
a
gentleman
he
straightened
himself
as
came
out
and
watched
her
closely
as
she
grasped
the
handle
of
the
freezer
but
it
seemed
to
the
spectator
above
that
he
watched
her
with
other
emotions
than
the
sincere
wish
to
learn
the
correct
manner
of
freezing
tucker
looked
straight
down
upon
her
upon
the
part
in
her
light
brown
hair
upon
her
round
little
arms
for
her
sleeves
were
rolled
up
above
the
elbow
as
she
said
didactically
it
ought
to
be
a
steady
even
but
she
got
no
further
for
her
pupil
without
a
word
stooped
forward
and
gathering
her
into
his
arms
kissed
her
iv
there
was
no
doubt
whatsoever
in
the
mind
of
the
spectator
that
this
caress
provoked
or
unprovoked
was
not
agreeable
to
its
recipient
the
young
man
was
large
and
heavy
and
she
was
minute
and
probably
weak
but
the
violence
of
her
recoil
was
sufficient
to
free
her
within
a
second
strength
thought
tucker
as
the
strength
of
ten
and
he
hoped
it
was
for
the
reason
alleged
by
the
poet
she
stood
an
instant
looking
at
her
visitor
and
then
she
said
in
a
tone
that
no
dog
would
have
attempted
to
disobey
go
away
go
home
and
please
do
ever
come
back
tucker
was
deeply
moved
it
is
to
be
feared
that
he
forgot
falkener
forgot
his
plans
for
his
friend
protection
forgot
everything
except
that
he
had
just
heard
himself
described
as
a
hero
of
romance
by
a
girl
of
superlative
charms
and
that
that
girl
had
just
been
the
object
of
the
obviously
unwelcome
attentions
of
another
he
recognized
that
the
stern
but
sympathetic
husband
on
the
stage
would
instantly
have
come
to
the
rescue
of
the
weak
young
wife
in
any
similar
situation
and
he
determined
on
the
instant
to
do
so
but
he
found
a
slight
difficulty
in
making
up
his
mind
as
to
the
particular
epigram
with
which
he
should
enter
in
fact
he
could
think
of
nothing
except
ah
is
the
ready
and
that
obviously
do
while
however
he
hesitated
above
the
dialogue
below
rushed
on
unimpeded
the
truth
is
said
the
young
man
with
the
violence
of
one
who
feels
himself
at
least
partially
in
the
wrong
the
truth
is
you
are
a
cold
cruel
woman
who
thinks
of
nothing
but
her
own
amusement
you
do
care
anything
about
the
sufferings
of
others
and
in
my
opinion
lily
is
worth
ten
of
you
then
why
do
you
go
and
kiss
lily
because
lily
is
that
sort
she
would
stand
it
this
reply
not
unnaturally
angered
the
cook
and
do
you
mean
to
say
i
stand
it
i
ca
help
it
i
so
horribly
small
but
if
i
could
i
kill
you
randolph
and
as
it
is
i
hate
you
for
doing
it
hate
you
more
than
you
have
any
idea
you
know
very
well
it
your
own
fault
you
tempted
me
how
could
i
know
about
your
silly
lack
of
you
always
pretended
to
like
me
just
what
i
did
pretended
but
i
never
have
to
pretend
again
thank
heaven
i
do
really
like
you
and
i
never
did
not
since
we
were
children
you
be
sorry
for
saying
that
when
you
calmer
i
may
be
sorry
for
saying
it
but
i
think
it
as
long
as
i
live
i
pity
the
man
who
marries
you
my
girl
you
a
bitter
tongue
you
marry
me
if
you
could
i
would
not
you
would
not
if
you
were
the
last
woman
in
the
world
illustration

to
inspection
good
night
the
culprit
seized
his
hat
and
rushed
away
through
the
shadows
before
tucker
had
time
to
think
put
the
dignified
rebuke
that
he
had
intended
there
was
a
pause
he
was
conscious
that
an
opportunity
had
slipped
from
him
he
knew
now
what
he
ought
to
have
said
he
should
have
asked
the
young
fellow
who
was
clearly
a
gentleman
far
above
in
social
position
whether
that
was
the
way
he
would
have
treated
a
girl
in
his
own
mother
and
whether
he
considered
that
less
chivalry
was
due
to
a
working
girl
than
to
a
woman
of
leisure
though
his
great
opportunity
was
gone
he
decided
to
do
whatever
remained
after
a
short
hesitation
he
descended
a
flight
of
steps
at
one
end
of
the
piazza
the
kitchen
opened
before
him
large
and
cavernous
two
lamps
hardly
served
to
light
it
it
was
red
tiled
round
its
walls
hung
large
bright
copper
saucepans
and
on
shelves
of
oak
along
its
sides
were
rows
of
dark
blue
and
white
plates
and
dishes
tucker
was
prepared
to
find
the
cook
in
tears
in
which
case
he
had
a
perfectly
definite
idea
as
to
what
to
do
but
the
disconcerting
young
woman
was
moving
rapidly
about
the
kitchen
humming
to
herself
she
held
a
small
but
steaming
saucepan
in
her
hand
which
was
as
tucker
swiftly
reflected
a
much
better
weapon
than
the
handle
of
an
freezer
good
evening
he
said
graciously
good
evening
sir
she
did
not
even
look
in
his
direction
but
bent
over
a
cauldron
i
wished
to
speak
to
you
he
said
about
that
little
incident
of
this
morning
you
must
not
think
that
i
am
by
nature
cruel
or
indifferent
to
animals
on
the
contrary
i
am
a
life
member
in
the
society
for
prevention
of
cruelty
to
them
i
love
animals
and
as
if
to
prove
his
words
he
put
out
his
hand
and
gently
pulled
the
ears
of
willoughby
who
was
asleep
in
a
chair
cats
ears
are
extraordinarily
sensitive
and
willoughby
woke
up
and
withdrew
his
head
with
a
jerk
willoughby
mistress
on
the
other
hand
made
no
reply
whatsoever
indeed
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
be
sure
she
had
heard
how
different
she
is
thought
tucker
in
the
presence
of
a
man
she
really
respects
and
recognizes
as
her
superior
all
the
levity
and
coquetry
disappear
from
her
bearing
i
was
truly
sorry
he
went
on
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
range
to
have
been
the
occasion
you
had
better
be
careful
sir
she
said
still
without
looking
at
him
these
sauces
sometimes
boil
over
and
as
she
spoke
she
put
a
spoon
into
the
pan
and
the
next
instant
tucker
felt
a
small
but
burning
drop
fall
upon
his
hand
he
started
back
with
an
exclamation
i
am
truly
sorry
sir
she
said
to
have
been
the
occasion
he
glanced
at
her
sharply
was
she
conscious
of
repeating
his
own
phrase
she
seemed
to
be
wholly
absorbed
in
her
task
he
noticed
how
prettily
the
hair
grew
at
the
back
of
her
neck
how
small
and
well
shaped
were
her
ears
his
manner
became
even
more
protecting
i
am
an
older
man
than
your
employer
he
began
yes
indeed
sir
he
decided
not
to
notice
the
interruption
i
am
older
and
have
seen
more
of
life
i
understand
more
perhaps
of
the
difficulties
of
a
young
and
i
must
say
beautiful
woman
why
must
you
say
that
sir
her
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
his
because
it
is
the
truth
my
dear
child
he
again
approached
the
range
but
as
a
fountain
instantly
rose
from
the
sauce
he
retreated
and
continued
i
would
like
if
any
little
troubles
in
the
household
arise
to
know
that
you
look
upon
me
as
a
friend
both
you
and
willoughby
he
thought
it
not
amiss
to
introduce
the
comic
note
now
and
again
i
have
some
influence
with
crane
i
should
be
glad
to
do
you
a
good
turn
you
can
do
me
one
now
sir
pray
tell
me
what
it
is
you
can
go
away
and
let
me
get
the
dinner
you
want
me
to
go
the
kitchen
is
no
place
for
gentlemen
tucker
laughed
tolerantly
did
you
think
so
ten
minutes
ago
for
the
second
time
she
looked
in
his
direction
as
she
asked
quickly
what
do
you
mean
your
last
visitor
was
not
so
respectful
she
had
put
down
the
saucepan
now
and
so
he
approached
and
tried
to
take
her
hand
perhaps
this
is
as
good
a
time
as
any
other
to
describe
the
sensation
of
taking
hand
the
ordinary
mortal
put
out
an
ordinary
hand
and
touched
something
something
presumably
flesh
and
blood
but
so
light
so
soft
so
pliant
that
it
seemed
literally
to
melt
into
the
folds
of
his
palm
so
that
even
after
the
hand
had
been
withdrawn
and
in
this
instance
it
was
instantly
withdrawn
the
feeling
seemed
to
remain
and
tucker
found
himself
staring
at
his
own
fingers
to
see
if
they
did
not
still
bear
traces
of
that
remarkable
contact
it
was
just
at
this
moment
that
brindlebury
entered
the
kitchen
and
said
in
a
tone
which
no
one
could
have
considered
respectful
that
the
motor
was
coming
up
the
drive
tucker
was
more
apt
to
meet
an
awkward
situation
and
the
situation
was
slightly
awkward
by
an
additional
dignity
of
manner
rather
than
by
any
action
ah
he
now
observed
in
that
case
i
think
i
must
go
and
meet
it
i
think
i
would
if
i
were
you
replied
the
boy
and
added
to
the
cook
in
case
there
was
any
mistake
about
his
meaning
it
seems
to
me
there
are
too
many
men
in
this
kitchen
in
the
course
of
the
day
well
goodness
knows
they
not
here
to
please
me
said
tucker
who
understood
that
this
reply
had
to
be
made
wished
nevertheless
that
she
had
not
made
it
with
such
a
convincing
sincerity
of
manner
he
turned
and
left
the
kitchen
and
as
he
went
up
the
piazza
stairs
became
aware
that
the
boy
was
following
him
he
stood
still
at
the
top
therefore
and
asked
with
that
hectoring
tone
which
many
people
think
so
desirable
to
use
with
servants
what
this
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
the
boy
hardly
troubled
to
approximate
civility
as
he
answered
yes
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
that
is
my
sister
tucker
laughed
with
indulgent
good
humor
indeed
he
said
well
i
can
not
confess
brindlebury
to
taking
a
very
deep
interest
in
your
family
relations
it
this
much
interest
that
i
do
want
you
going
into
the
kitchen
to
talk
to
her
tut
tut
said
tucker
i
think
i
shall
have
to
report
you
to
your
employer
and
i
may
have
to
report
you
this
was
so
beyond
the
bounds
of
convention
that
tucker
thought
best
to
ignore
it
he
merely
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
into
the
house
where
in
the
hall
he
found
the
two
falkener
ladies
taking
off
their
coats
falkener
was
all
graciousness
she
was
engaged
in
unwinding
a
veil
from
her
face
and
as
she
freed
her
nose
from
its
meshes
she
said
briskly
and
how
is
the
housekeeping
going
how
is
your
staff
working
crane
got
them
into
the
where
tea
was
waiting
falkener
spoke
to
him
but
she
cast
a
secret
glance
of
question
at
tucker
under
most
circumstances
he
would
have
replied
by
raising
his
eyebrows
shrugging
his
shoulders
closing
his
eyes
or
conveying
in
some
manner
the
true
reply
to
her
demand
but
now
he
merely
looked
into
his
teacup
which
he
was
diligently
stirring
he
found
himself
uncertain
what
to
do
he
had
no
intention
of
mentioning
the
afternoon
incidents
to
crane
he
did
not
wish
he
told
himself
to
tell
on
a
poor
young
woman
and
perhaps
deprive
her
of
her
job
besides
it
is
very
difficult
to
tell
a
story
in
which
you
have
been
an
eavesdropper
and
tell
it
with
any
sort
of
flourish
and
satisfaction
the
geography
of
the
balcony
was
such
that
he
would
have
to
confess
either
to
having
leaned
as
far
over
the
rail
as
possible
or
else
to
having
been
in
the
kitchen
but
the
insolence
of
the
boy
brindlebury
put
a
new
face
on
the
matter
he
deserved
reproof
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
he
might
tell
in
a
mistaken
desire
to
protect
his
sister
from
annoyance
to
tell
any
of
this
to
falkener
was
to
put
a
weapon
in
her
hands
which
she
would
not
fail
to
use
to
get
out
of
the
house
within
hours
tucker
first
idea
was
that
he
did
not
wish
to
leave
the
house
but
as
he
sat
stirring
his
tea
another
thought
came
to
him
why
should
she
not
leave
why
should
she
not
become
his
own
cook
crane
after
all
only
offered
her
employment
for
a
few
weeks
whereas
he
he
decided
that
it
would
be
better
for
crane
to
get
rid
of
her
he
decided
as
he
put
it
to
himself
to
be
perfectly
open
with
his
friend
if
crane
turned
her
out
then
he
tucker
would
be
there
helpful
and
ready
like
the
competent
hero
of
the
drama
whom
she
herself
had
so
well
described
he
joined
but
little
in
the
conversation
round
the
and
falkener
watching
him
narrowly
feared
from
his
gravity
that
something
serious
had
happened
that
the
situation
was
worse
than
she
had
imagined
what
she
wondered
had
occurred
in
the
last
hours
what
had
those
evil
women
with
manicured
nails
accomplished
in
her
absence
she
manoeuvered
two
or
three
times
to
get
a
word
with
tucker
but
he
seemed
unconscious
of
her
efforts
when
at
last
they
all
agreed
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
tucker
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
his
host
arm
could
i
have
just
a
word
with
you
burt
he
said
crane
always
felt
like
a
naughty
child
when
his
friend
spoke
to
him
like
this
would
later
do
he
asked
i
want
to
get
a
bath
before
dinner
and
if
we
keep
it
waiting
we
may
spoil
some
of
those
wonderful
dishes
that
beauty
in
the
kitchen
is
preparing
for
us
it
is
about
her
i
want
to
speak
to
you
both
ladies
and
crane
turned
instantly
at
these
words
then
the
falkeners
with
a
strong
effort
of
left
the
room
and
the
two
men
were
alone
well
what
is
it
said
crane
rather
sharply
tucker
was
now
all
suavity
i
afraid
after
all
he
began
sitting
down
and
swinging
one
leg
over
the
other
that
you
wo
be
able
to
keep
that
young
person
afraid
falkener
was
right
women
know
these
things
at
a
glance
what
things
why
i
mean
that
in
spite
of
her
good
dinner
i
afraid
your
cook
burt
is
not
well
i
better
tell
you
just
what
is
in
my
mind
surely
if
you
can
said
his
host
and
client
i
went
out
for
a
little
while
about
dusk
on
the
back
piazza
which
you
know
is
just
above
the
kitchen
and
a
conversation
below
is
audible
there
at
first
i
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
murmur
of
voices
but
gradually
i
became
aware
that
some
one
was
making
love
to
who
was
it
asked
crane
that
wretched
boy
that
smug
butler
alas
no
said
tucker
if
it
had
been
one
of
the
other
servants
i
should
not
have
thought
it
much
harm
unhappily
it
was
a
young
gentleman
a
person
so
much
her
social
superior
well
my
dear
fellow
you
get
the
idea
no
one
you
knew
of
course
i
never
saw
him
before
how
did
you
see
him
at
all
this
was
the
question
that
tucker
had
been
anticipating
why
to
tell
you
the
truth
burt
he
said
when
i
realized
what
was
going
on
i
thought
it
my
duty
for
your
sake
to
find
out
i
looked
over
the
railing
and
just
at
the
psychological
moment
when
he
kissed
her
crane
was
tapping
a
cigarette
thoughtfully
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
did
not
at
once
answer
when
he
did
he
looked
up
with
a
smile
and
said
lucky
dog
is
what
i
say
tuck
i
do
think
answered
his
friend
that
that
is
quite
the
right
attitude
for
you
to
assume
what
do
you
think
i
should
do
dismiss
the
girl
another
pause
or
added
tucker
magnanimously
if
you
shrink
from
the
interview
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
do
it
for
you
crane
looked
up
no
thank
you
he
said
i
think
you
have
done
quite
enough
i
should
not
dream
of
imposing
upon
you
further
he
walked
to
the
bell
and
rang
it
smithfield
appeared
tell
the
cook
i
want
to
see
her
he
said
after
a
brief
absence
smithfield
returned
i
beg
pardon
sir
he
said
but
the
cook
says
if
she
leaves
dinner
now
it
will
be
spoiled
and
wo
after
dinner
do
crane
nodded
you
know
said
tucker
when
they
were
again
alone
it
is
not
always
necessary
to
tell
servants
why
you
are
dispensing
with
their
services
you
might
say
much
to
his
surprise
crane
interrupted
him
with
a
laugh
my
dear
tuck
he
said
you
do
really
suppose
do
you
that
i
am
going
to
dismiss
that
peerless
woman
just
because
you
saw
an
fellow
kiss
her
i
shall
administer
a
telling
rebuke
with
a
slight
sketch
of
my
notions
on
female
deportment
it
would
take
more
than
that
to
induce
me
to
send
her
away
indeed
i
was
thinking
of
taking
her
north
with
me
this
was
a
serious
suggestion
but
tucker
could
think
of
no
better
way
to
meet
it
than
to
raise
his
eyebrows
and
crane
went
off
whistling
to
dress
for
dinner
he
whistled
not
only
going
upstairs
but
he
whistled
in
his
bath
and
while
he
was
shaving
the
sound
annoyed
tucker
in
the
next
room
it
almost
seems
he
thought
as
if
he
were
glad
to
see
the
woman
again
on
any
terms
and
yet
he
tucker
knew
that
she
considered
crane
quite
a
commonplace
young
man
not
at
all
like
a
hero
in
the
third
act
the
way
crane
had
taken
his
suggestions
was
distressing
tucker
did
not
feel
that
he
thoroughly
understood
what
was
in
the
younger
man
mind
his
first
intention
to
tell
falkener
nothing
began
to
fade
it
would
have
been
all
very
well
if
burton
had
been
sensible
and
had
been
willing
to
send
the
cook
away
and
he
tucker
had
been
able
to
engage
her
to
ignore
the
whole
matter
to
falkener
indeed
it
would
have
been
hard
to
explain
it
but
of
course
if
burton
was
going
to
be
obstinate
about
it
falkener
aid
might
be
absolutely
necessary
after
all
he
thought
candor
is
the
best
policy
among
friends
he
dressed
quickly
and
was
not
mistaken
in
his
belief
that
falkener
would
have
done
the
same
she
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
they
had
a
clear
fifteen
minutes
before
dinner
now
tell
me
my
dear
solon
she
said
just
what
you
think
of
the
situation
i
think
badly
of
it
yes
said
falkener
not
yet
quite
appreciating
the
seriousness
of
his
tone
i
do
myself
that
idiotic
housemaid
lily
i
could
have
told
him
that
name
would
never
do
hooked
me
twice
wrong
and
left
my
daughter
dirty
boots
on
top
of
her
best
ah
if
incompetence
were
all
we
had
to
complain
of
the
cook
is
perfection
as
far
as
cooking
goes
but
in
other
respect
really
my
dear
falkener
i
am
in
doubt
whether
you
should
let
your
daughter
stay
in
this
house
at
least
until
burton
comes
to
his
senses
you
must
tell
me
just
what
you
mean
tucker
decided
to
tell
the
story
reluctantly
why
it
happened
this
afternoon
burton
was
away
with
his
horses
and
quite
by
accident
i
came
upon
his
pretty
cook
in
the
arms
of
a
strange
young
man
a
person
vastly
her
social
superior
one
of
the
young
landholders
of
the
neighborhood
i
should
say
seemed
to
assume
the
most
confident
right
to
be
in
burton
kitchen
a
man
he
may
know
in
the
hunting
field
may
have
to
dinner
i
do
know
who
he
is
but
certainly
a
gentleman
how
very
unpleasant
said
falkener
did
the
woman
take
in
that
you
had
detected
her
yes
and
seemed
quite
unabashed
and
now
i
suppose
you
are
hesitating
whether
or
not
to
tell
burton
tucker
was
naturally
cautious
and
what
would
you
advise
it
is
your
duty
to
tell
him
at
once
and
get
such
a
person
out
of
the
house
you
think
if
i
told
him
he
would
dismiss
her
i
am
confident
he
would
unless
unless
illustration
from
the
olivia
hears
of
her
critical
illness
unless
he
has
himself
some
interest
in
her
ah
said
tucker
with
a
deep
sigh
that
the
question
at
this
moment
miss
falkener
looking
very
handsome
in
a
dress
came
in
she
too
perhaps
had
expected
that
somebody
would
be
dressed
a
little
ahead
of
time
for
the
sake
of
a
few
minutes
private
talk
if
so
she
was
disappointed
ah
cora
said
her
mother
brightly
let
us
hear
how
the
piano
sounds
give
us
some
of
that
delightful
chopin
you
were
playing
last
evening
cora
to
show
her
independence
of
spirit
sat
down
and
began
to
play
ragtime
but
neither
of
her
auditors
noticed
the
difference
you
mean
whispered
falkener
that
you
have
reason
to
suppose
that
crane
himself
why
to
be
candid
my
dear
lady
replied
tucker
i
did
tell
him
you
may
have
noticed
i
seemed
a
trifle
abstracted
at
tea
time
i
was
considering
what
it
was
best
to
do
well
when
you
left
us
i
told
him
what
do
you
think
he
said
dog
that
was
all
just
dog
meaning
you
no
no
meaning
the
fellow
who
had
been
kissing
the
cook
dear
me
said
falkener
how
very
light
minded
it
shocked
me
to
have
him
take
it
like
that
and
he
would
not
hear
of
dismissing
her
he
intends
merely
to
reprove
her
so
he
says
but
what
reproof
is
possible
and
the
most
alarming
feature
of
the
whole
situation
is
that
to
my
opinion
he
is
looking
forward
to
the
interview
the
woman
must
be
sent
out
of
the
house
immediately
said
falkener
with
decision
i
wonder
if
higher
wages
would
tempt
her
i
see
your
idea
answered
tucker
you
think
i
ought
to
offer
a
position
i
would
do
more
than
that
to
save
burt
a
position
as
cook
you
mean
why
falkener
what
else
could
i
mean
oh
nothing
solon
i
only
thought
the
friends
were
still
explaining
away
the
little
misunderstanding
when
crane
came
down
and
dinner
was
announced
falkener
with
of
course
the
heartiest
wish
to
criticize
was
forced
to
admit
the
food
was
perfection
the
soup
so
clear
and
strong
the
fried
fish
so
dry
and
tender
even
the
cheese
soufflé
for
which
she
had
waited
most
hopefully
turned
out
to
be
beautifully
light
and
fluffy
having
come
to
curse
she
was
obliged
to
bless
and
her
praise
was
delightful
to
crane
yes
is
she
a
wonder
he
kept
saying
was
it
great
luck
to
find
any
one
like
that
in
a
place
such
as
this
tuck
here
keeps
trying
to
poison
my
mind
against
her
but
i
would
part
with
a
cook
like
that
even
if
she
were
a
messalina
falkener
who
could
on
the
instant
remember
who
messalina
was
attempted
to
look
as
if
she
thought
it
would
be
better
not
to
mention
such
people
in
the
presence
of
her
daughter
tuck
an
inhuman
old
creature
is
he
mrs
falkener
crane
went
on
i
do
believe
he
ever
had
a
natural
impulse
in
his
life
and
so
he
has
no
sympathy
with
the
impulses
of
others
tucker
smiled
quietly
it
came
to
him
that
just
so
the
iron
reserve
of
the
hero
was
often
misinterpreted
during
the
first
two
acts
by
more
frivolous
members
of
the
cast
as
they
rose
from
table
miss
falkener
said
it
such
a
lovely
night
such
a
moon
have
you
seen
it
mr
crane
well
i
saw
it
as
we
drove
over
from
the
station
returned
crane
a
trifle
absently
he
had
become
thoughtful
as
dinner
ended
do
you
think
said
cora
that
it
would
be
too
cold
to
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
i
should
like
to
see
the
old
box
and
the
cedars
by
moonlight
not
a
bit
let
go
out
i
have
something
to
do
first
but
it
take
me
ten
minutes
but
he
added
you
must
not
catch
cold
and
get
laid
up
and
miss
the
run
i
going
to
put
you
on
a
new
irish
mare
i
just
bought
and
they
found
themselves
talking
not
about
the
garden
but
the
stable
in
the
midst
of
it
smithfield
came
into
the
with
the
coffee
and
crane
said
to
him
in
a
low
tone
oh
smithfield
tell
the
cook
i
see
her
now
in
the
little
office
across
the
hall
smithfield
looked
graver
than
usual
beg
pardon
sir
he
said
but
the
cook
was
feeling
tired
and
has
gone
up
to
bed
sir
crane
was
just
helping
himself
to
sugar
she
cooked
this
coffee
did
she
he
said
yes
sir
she
ca
have
been
gone
very
long
then
about
five
minutes
sir
go
up
and
tell
her
to
come
down
said
crane
he
turned
again
to
miss
falkener
and
went
on
about
the
past
performances
of
the
irish
mare
but
it
was
quite
clear
to
all
who
heard
him
that
his
heart
was
no
longer
in
the
topic
smithfield
return
was
greeted
by
complete
silence
well
said
crane
sharply
beg
pardon
sir
said
smithfield
says
that
she
is
very
tired
and
that
if
the
morning
will
do
the
morning
will
not
do
answered
crane
with
a
promptness
unusual
in
him
go
up
and
tell
her
that
if
she
is
not
in
my
office
within
ten
minutes
i
come
up
myself
smithfield
bowed
and
withdrew
silence
again
descended
on
the
room
falkener
and
tucker
were
silent
because
they
both
felt
that
thus
their
faces
expressed
more
plainly
than
words
could
do
that
this
was
just
about
what
they
had
expected
but
cora
who
was
young
enough
to
understand
that
anger
may
be
a
form
of
interest
watched
him
with
a
strangely
wistful
expression
after
what
seemed
to
every
one
an
interminable
delay
smithfield
entered
again
he
looked
pale
and
graver
than
any
one
had
ever
seen
his
habitually
grave
countenance
is
in
your
office
now
sir
he
said
crane
rose
at
once
and
left
the
room
followed
by
smithfield
v
was
standing
in
the
office
with
her
hands
folded
and
an
expression
of
the
utmost
calm
upon
her
face
crane
came
in
quickly
and
would
have
shut
the
door
but
for
the
fact
that
smithfield
was
immediately
behind
him
beg
pardon
sir
he
said
firmly
sliding
into
the
room
but
i
must
look
to
the
fire
crane
frowned
the
fire
all
right
he
said
shortly
but
smithfield
was
not
to
be
put
off
his
duties
and
began
to
poke
the
logs
and
sweep
the
hearth
until
peremptorily
ordered
to
go
when
the
door
finally
closed
behind
him
crane
stood
silent
a
moment
with
his
hand
on
the
mantelpiece
the
whole
tone
of
the
interview
upon
which
it
now
occurred
to
him
he
had
rushed
somewhat
too
hastily
would
be
decided
by
whether
he
spoke
standing
up
or
sitting
down
his
feelings
were
for
the
first
his
intellect
for
the
latter
position
his
intellect
won
he
sat
down
in
a
deep
chair
and
crossed
his
legs
as
he
did
so
the
cook
eyes
which
had
hitherto
been
fixed
on
the
carpet
now
raised
themselves
to
the
level
of
his
neat
pumps
and
black
silk
socks
he
was
aware
of
this
but
did
not
allow
himself
to
be
disconcerted
i
suppose
you
can
guess
why
i
sent
for
you
he
said
the
dinner
was
not
satisfactory
sir
i
doubt
if
you
could
cook
an
unsatisfactory
dinner
if
you
tried
he
returned
no
the
trouble
is
over
something
that
happened
an
hour
or
so
before
dinner
you
did
not
approve
perhaps
of
that
gentleman
tucker
coming
into
the
kitchen
but
indeed
i
could
not
help
that
oh
said
crane
so
tucker
was
in
the
kitchen
was
he
yes
sir
until
brindlebury
told
him
the
motor
was
coming
with
the
ladies
no
said
crane
the
difficulty
is
over
a
former
visitor
of
yours
i
think
it
my
right
even
my
duty
to
prevent
anything
happening
in
this
house
of
which
i
disapprove
and
i
do
not
approve
of
strangers
coming
into
my
house
and
kissing
the
cook
he
looked
at
her
squarely
as
he
said
this
but
her
eyes
remained
fixed
on
his
feet
as
she
replied
docilely
yes
sir
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
speak
to
the
young
man
about
it
ah
returned
her
employer
as
one
now
going
over
familiar
ground
you
mean
to
imply
that
it
was
not
your
fault
she
did
not
directly
answer
this
question
she
said
i
suppose
in
your
class
of
life
a
gentleman
would
not
under
any
circumstances
kiss
a
young
lady
against
her
will
well
answered
crane
with
some
amusement
he
certainly
never
ought
to
do
so
and
by
the
way
one
of
the
points
about
this
incident
seems
to
be
that
the
young
man
in
question
had
the
appearance
of
being
a
gentleman
he
certainly
considers
himself
so
there
was
a
pause
then
crane
said
seriously
i
do
want
to
interfere
in
your
concerns
further
than
i
have
to
or
to
offer
you
advice
but
i
should
be
so
glad
to
have
you
offer
me
advice
sir
it
is
one
of
the
few
things
a
gentleman
may
offer
a
girl
in
my
position
and
she
accept
with
a
clear
conscience
for
the
first
time
crane
looked
at
her
with
suspicion
her
tone
and
look
were
demure
in
the
extreme
he
decided
to
go
on
well
then
he
said
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
have
a
gentleman
especially
such
an
impulsive
one
hanging
about
unless
you
are
engaged
to
him
with
the
consent
of
your
family
she
raised
her
chin
without
lifting
her
eyes
it
not
the
consent
of
our
families
that
lacking
she
remarked
oh
he
asked
you
to
marry
him
almost
every
day
sir
until
and
he
did
he
said
he
would
marry
me
if
i
were
the
last
woman
in
the
world
and
what
did
you
think
about
that
i
thought
it
was
true
sir
crane
laughed
aloud
at
this
direct
answer
and
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
you
were
right
he
said
but
at
the
same
time
i
ca
see
for
the
life
of
me
why
if
you
do
mean
to
marry
him
you
let
him
kiss
you
if
you
please
sir
it
not
always
possible
to
prevent
you
see
not
very
large
crane
looked
at
her
and
had
to
admit
that
the
feat
would
be
extremely
easy
she
hardly
came
to
one
shoulder
almost
any
man
hastily
putting
aside
this
train
of
thought
he
said
in
a
more
judicial
tone
you
know
your
own
affairs
best
is
the
young
man
able
to
support
you
yes
sir
very
comfortably
and
yet
you
do
consider
marrying
him
no
sir
i
do
love
him
matters
had
suddenly
become
rather
serious
you
would
rather
work
for
your
living
than
marry
a
man
you
do
love
crane
asked
almost
in
spite
of
himself
for
the
first
time
the
cook
looked
up
straight
at
him
as
she
answered
i
think
i
would
rather
die
sir
this
time
it
was
crane
eyes
that
dropped
fortunately
he
reflected
she
could
not
have
any
idea
how
sharply
her
remark
had
touched
his
own
inner
state
how
clearly
she
saw
that
it
was
wrong
to
do
just
what
he
was
contemplating
doing
to
marry
for
prudence
rather
than
for
love
he
found
himself
speculating
on
the
genesis
of
the
moral
sense
how
it
developed
in
difficulties
rather
than
in
ease
that
was
why
he
could
learn
something
on
the
subject
from
his
cook
here
was
a
girl
working
for
her
living
working
hard
and
long
for
wages
which
though
he
had
once
he
remembered
told
reed
they
seemed
excessive
now
appeared
to
him
the
merest
pittance
certainly
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
hardships
of
such
a
life
would
be
smoothed
away
by
this
suggested
marriage
and
yet
she
could
assert
clearly
that
she
would
rather
die
than
make
it
whereas
he
with
nothing
very
much
at
stake
had
actually
been
contemplating
for
several
months
the
making
of
just
such
a
marriage
he
was
interrupted
by
her
respectful
tones
will
that
be
all
sir
yes
he
answered
in
a
voice
that
lacked
finality
i
suppose
all
except
if
that
fellow
comes
bothering
you
any
more
let
me
know
and
i
tell
him
what
i
think
of
him
lifted
the
corner
of
her
mouth
in
a
terrible
smile
oh
she
said
i
do
think
he
come
bothering
any
more
you
very
optimistic
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
those
long
words
very
hopeful
i
meant
he
be
back
not
after
what
i
said
to
him
well
if
you
have
really
found
the
potent
thing
to
say
under
such
circumstances
you
a
true
benefactor
to
your
sex
she
looked
at
him
with
mild
confusion
i
afraid
i
do
rightly
understand
sir
he
smiled
it
was
my
way
of
asking
you
what
you
had
said
to
him
that
you
imagined
would
keep
him
from
coming
back
i
told
him
i
had
only
pretended
to
like
him
all
these
years
people
particularly
gentlemen
do
like
to
think
you
have
to
pretend
to
like
them
crane
laughed
aloud
wondering
if
the
girl
had
any
idea
how
amusing
she
was
in
the
pause
that
followed
the
sound
of
a
deep
masculine
voice
could
be
heard
suddenly
under
their
feet
the
office
was
immediately
above
the
servants
and
it
was
but
too
evident
that
a
visitor
had
just
entered
crane
looked
at
the
cook
questioningly
and
she
had
the
grace
to
color
why
did
you
ever
sir
she
said
there
he
is
this
very
moment
shall
i
go
down
and
forbid
him
the
house
asked
burton
and
though
he
spoke
in
fun
he
would
have
been
delighted
to
act
in
earnest
oh
no
sir
thank
you
she
answered
i
am
not
going
back
to
the
kitchen
this
reminded
her
employer
of
the
extreme
difficulty
he
had
experienced
in
seeing
his
cook
at
all
why
did
you
try
and
get
out
of
seeing
me
he
said
you
knew
about
what
i
had
to
say
i
suppose
i
had
a
notion
sir
and
were
you
afraid
at
this
question
the
cook
bent
her
head
until
a
shadow
fell
upon
it
but
crane
had
a
clear
impression
that
she
was
laughing
so
clear
that
he
said
and
may
i
ask
why
it
is
a
comic
idea
that
a
servant
should
be
afraid
of
her
employer
the
cook
now
raised
a
face
and
said
most
respectfully
no
sir
i
was
not
exactly
afraid
and
having
said
this
without
the
slightest
warning
she
burst
into
an
unmistakable
giggle
nobody
probably
enjoys
finding
that
the
idea
of
his
inspiring
terror
is
merely
ludicrous
crane
regarded
his
cook
with
a
sternness
that
was
not
entirely
false
she
still
struggling
to
regain
complete
gravity
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
said
civilly
oh
i
do
hope
you
excuse
my
laughing
sir
the
fact
is
that
it
was
not
i
who
tried
to
avoid
seeing
you
it
was
smithfield
idea
smithfield
cried
crane
yes
sir
he
had
the
notion
i
think
that
you
might
be
very
severe
with
me
sir
and
smithfield
is
peculiar
he
has
a
very
sensitive
nature
well
upon
my
word
cried
crane
springing
to
his
feet
that
is
exactly
what
smithfield
says
about
you
it
seems
to
me
i
have
a
damned
queer
houseful
of
servants
the
cook
edged
to
the
door
perhaps
it
seems
so
sir
she
said
will
that
be
all
for
yes
no
he
added
hastily
i
have
one
more
thing
to
say
to
you
and
it
this
do
make
the
mistake
of
fancying
that
i
have
taken
this
whole
incident
lightly
i
do
it
really
must
not
happen
again
understand
that
clearly
you
mean
if
that
gentleman
came
back
you
would
dismiss
me
sir
i
think
i
would
he
answered
even
if
it
were
my
fault
was
the
fault
entirely
his
ask
him
sir
you
know
much
more
about
it
than
he
does
was
the
fault
entirely
his
the
cook
wriggled
her
shoulders
crumpled
her
apron
and
seemed
unwilling
to
answer
a
direct
question
directly
at
last
an
idea
occurred
to
her
she
looked
up
brightly
it
was
the
sir
she
said
i
was
trying
to
teach
him
how
to
freeze
slowly
it
ought
to
be
done
like
this
and
bending
over
an
imaginary
freezer
she
imitated
with
her
absurdly
small
hand
the
suave
gentle
rotary
motion
essential
to
the
great
american
luxury
as
he
stood
looking
down
on
her
it
seemed
to
crane
extraordinarily
clear
how
it
had
all
happened
so
clear
indeed
that
for
a
second
it
almost
seemed
as
if
he
himself
were
in
the
place
of
the
culprit
whose
conduct
he
had
just
been
condemning
he
stepped
back
hastily
no
he
said
it
was
not
all
his
fault
of
that
you
have
convinced
me
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
the
door
will
that
be
all
sir
the
cook
you
know
has
to
get
up
so
very
early
in
the
morning
he
tried
to
counteract
the
feeling
of
pity
and
shame
that
swept
over
him
at
the
realization
that
this
young
and
delicate
creature
had
to
get
up
at
dawn
to
work
for
him
and
his
guests
the
effort
made
his
tone
rather
severe
as
he
said
yes
that
all
goodnight
good
night
sir
she
answered
with
her
unruffled
sweetness
and
was
gone
he
stood
still
a
moment
conscious
of
an
unusual
alertness
both
of
mind
and
emotion
and
that
very
alertness
made
him
aware
that
at
that
moment
there
was
a
man
in
his
kitchen
against
whom
he
felt
the
keenest
personal
animosity
crane
would
have
dearly
liked
to
go
down
and
turn
him
out
but
he
resisted
the
impulse
which
somehow
savored
of
tucker
in
his
mind
and
what
by
the
way
had
tucker
been
doing
in
the
kitchen
and
smithfield
why
had
smithfield
tried
to
interfere
with
his
seeing
the
cook
he
found
plenty
of
food
for
reflection
among
other
things
he
had
to
consider
his
return
to
the
looking
at
his
watch
he
observed
that
a
longer
time
had
elapsed
since
he
left
it
than
he
had
supposed
there
would
be
comments
there
would
be
attempted
jokes
from
tucker
well
that
would
be
easily
met
by
a
question
as
to
tucker
own
interest
in
the
culinary
art
falkener
methods
of
attack
were
not
subtle
either
but
cora
he
wished
cora
would
not
just
look
at
him
as
if
he
had
done
something
cruel
but
as
is
so
often
the
way
when
we
prepare
ourselves
for
one
situation
quite
another
one
turns
up
the
three
were
not
sitting
awaiting
his
return
the
was
empty
except
for
falkener
who
was
reading
when
he
entered
and
instead
of
betraying
a
conviction
that
he
had
been
too
long
away
she
looked
up
and
said
chattily
well
did
you
reduce
the
young
woman
to
order
that
is
a
good
deal
to
expect
from
an
unaided
male
is
it
said
burton
very
much
relieved
ah
it
depends
on
the
male
my
dear
burton
you
i
imagine
could
be
very
terrifying
if
you
wished
to
be
what
did
the
young
woman
do
weep
protest
declare
that
it
had
all
taken
place
quite
without
her
consent
burton
smiled
he
had
no
intention
whatsoever
of
sharing
his
recent
experiences
with
falkener
ah
he
said
i
see
you
know
your
own
sex
thoroughly
where
are
tuck
and
your
daughter
solon
is
taking
a
turn
on
the
piazza
he
hopes
it
will
make
him
sleep
better
and
cora
was
tired
and
has
gone
to
bed
falkener
sighed
cora
does
seem
very
well
to
me
i
sorry
to
hear
that
returned
crane
i
thought
she
was
looking
very
fit
this
evening
he
spoke
more
lightly
than
he
felt
however
for
something
portentous
in
falkener
tone
struck
him
with
alarm
sit
down
burton
said
she
sweeping
her
hand
toward
a
cushioned
stool
at
her
side
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
crane
found
himself
obeying
with
his
hands
between
his
knees
and
his
toes
turned
in
like
a
school
boy
who
has
forgotten
his
lesson
then
becoming
aware
of
this
pose
he
suddenly
changed
it
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
as
he
had
done
in
the
office
a
few
minutes
before
in
the
meantime
falkener
was
saying
the
truth
is
i
afraid
that
we
must
cut
our
visit
short
delightful
as
it
promises
to
be
oh
falkener
we
not
making
you
comfortable
what
is
it
no
burton
no
falkener
held
up
her
hand
you
are
making
us
perfectly
comfortable
at
least
in
all
essentials
and
who
minds
roughing
it
now
and
then
for
a
week
or
so
it
good
for
us
she
added
playfully
the
housemaid
is
not
but
no
matter
what
has
the
housemaid
done
asked
crane
with
what
semblance
of
interest
he
could
summon
but
as
he
spoke
his
heart
went
out
in
sympathy
to
every
hotel
and
keeper
in
the
world
good
heavens
he
thought
suppose
my
living
depended
on
my
pleasing
them
what
a
state
i
should
be
in
aloud
he
said
what
has
lily
been
doing
nothing
nothing
lily
means
well
i
sure
in
spite
of
her
lackadaisical
ways
it
is
quite
a
privilege
i
assure
you
to
be
waited
on
by
such
an
elegant
young
lady
she
hooked
me
up
wrong
twice
this
evening
and
when
i
not
unnaturally
objected
she
stuck
a
pin
in
me
oh
by
accident
i
sure
no
i
have
no
fault
to
find
with
lily
whatsoever
i
glad
to
hear
that
said
crane
punctuating
his
sentence
to
allow
himself
to
indulge
in
a
yawn
who
is
it
then
not
smithfield
or
the
boy
oh
i
should
never
have
anything
to
do
with
that
boy
said
falkener
bridling
oh
never
in
the
world
i
think
he
i
saw
him
stick
out
his
tongue
at
solon
this
evening
crane
laughed
though
he
knew
he
ought
not
to
did
solon
see
no
the
boy
contrived
it
so
that
solon
had
just
looked
away
well
then
perhaps
he
not
after
all
said
burton
it
occurs
to
me
that
perhaps
that
is
the
only
reply
to
a
good
deal
that
solon
says
i
devoted
to
solon
replied
falkener
drawing
herself
up
and
i
must
say
you
ought
to
i
am
i
am
said
crane
hastily
but
i
am
at
the
same
time
able
to
understand
why
brindlebury
possibly
is
but
come
falkener
if
it
is
these
servants
that
are
driving
you
away
what
is
it
i
do
know
how
to
explain
it
said
falkener
it
not
really
clear
to
me
myself
i
sure
i
do
want
to
be
unkind
or
to
hurt
any
one
feelings
least
of
all
yours
my
dear
burt
and
she
leaned
over
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
crane
gave
it
a
good
brisk
squeeze
and
returned
it
to
her
lap
as
if
it
were
too
dear
for
his
possessing
and
she
went
on
i
own
i
am
anxious
about
cora
she
is
very
deep
very
reserved
she
tells
me
nothing
but
she
is
not
happy
burton
i
sorry
for
that
said
crane
in
a
very
tone
he
got
up
and
went
to
a
table
where
the
cigarettes
were
the
profound
male
instinct
of
was
now
thoroughly
awake
and
he
knew
exactly
what
he
was
in
for
only
he
noted
that
if
he
had
had
this
interview
with
falkener
before
he
had
seen
the
cook
he
might
quite
easily
have
been
persuaded
that
in
the
absence
of
any
more
definite
vocation
he
had
been
created
to
make
cora
falkener
life
tolerable
to
her
as
it
was
he
saw
perfectly
that
altruism
was
no
sound
basis
for
matrimony
you
do
understand
what
it
is
to
be
a
mother
burt
crane
admitted
with
a
shake
of
his
head
that
he
did
but
i
have
an
instinct
that
this
is
not
the
best
place
for
cora
well
if
you
were
a
man
falkener
said
crane
i
should
say
that
that
instinct
was
the
result
of
being
poorly
valeted
it
must
be
a
bore
for
women
to
have
a
wretched
maid
like
lily
do
you
think
that
if
i
found
some
one
a
little
more
competent
that
you
and
cora
would
feel
you
could
put
in
at
least
a
week
or
so
with
us
the
hunting
is
really
going
to
be
good
and
cora
does
enjoy
hunting
falkener
refused
to
lighten
the
tone
of
the
conversation
she
shook
her
head
no
she
said
no
i
afraid
even
a
good
maid
would
not
help
in
fact
to
speak
plainly
my
dear
burton
but
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
tucker
came
in
his
hair
was
somewhat
rumpled
by
the
wind
his
hands
were
still
in
his
pockets
as
he
had
had
them
during
his
constitutional
on
the
front
porch
and
his
eyes
contracted
by
the
sudden
light
looked
almost
white
well
he
said
are
you
enjoying
this
musical
party
downstairs
all
three
listened
in
silence
and
could
hear
the
strains
of
home
sweet
home
coming
from
below
they
have
a
phonograph
and
they
are
singing
in
parts
said
tucker
as
if
this
somehow
made
it
worse
if
we
got
miss
falkener
down
we
might
do
something
ourselves
said
crane
but
there
was
nothing
frivolous
in
his
manner
when
he
rang
and
told
smithfield
there
was
too
much
noise
downstairs
smithfield
begged
pardon
and
had
not
a
notion
it
could
be
heard
upstairs
crane
said
the
boy
brindlebury
tenor
carried
some
distance
and
falkener
and
tucker
having
gone
he
added
that
the
house
could
be
shut
for
the
night
then
he
went
to
the
table
and
his
eye
fell
again
upon
the
miniature
in
the
pearl
frame
he
took
it
up
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
there
was
an
extraordinary
likeness
to
he
smiled
to
himself
how
very
charming
she
would
look
he
thought
in
a
mauve
ball
dress
raising
his
eyes
he
found
smithfield
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
he
did
not
thoroughly
like
vi
on
the
stroke
of
seven
the
next
morning
burton
came
downstairs
with
that
exactness
which
even
the
most
careless
man
can
display
in
regard
to
his
favorite
sport
the
rigors
of
the
season
being
over
the
meet
did
not
take
place
until
eight
cora
was
not
yet
ready
for
breakfast
and
crane
went
to
fill
his
cigarette
case
before
starting
the
was
still
dark
and
in
disorder
crane
lit
a
match
to
find
his
way
to
the
table
where
the
tobacco
was
kept
it
was
the
same
table
on
which
had
lain
the
miniature
of
the
lady
in
the
mauve
ball
dress
and
as
he
held
up
his
lighted
match
his
eyes
sought
once
more
that
enchanting
pearl
circle
the
flame
died
down
and
burned
his
fingers
before
his
eyes
had
encountered
what
they
were
looking
for
he
lit
a
second
match
and
then
a
candle
before
he
could
assure
himself
that
the
miniature
was
really
gone
he
sprang
into
the
hall
and
called
smithfield
with
a
violence
that
had
little
respect
for
late
sleepers
smithfield
came
hurrying
out
of
the
where
the
miniature
that
used
to
be
on
this
table
the
what
is
it
sir
the
miniature
a
picture
in
a
pearl
frame
smithfield
looked
thoughtful
and
what
was
it
a
picture
of
sir
of
a
lady
in
a
black
lace
cap
and
she
with
white
hair
sir
no
said
crane
she
was
young
and
lovely
in
a
ball
dress
and
a
wreath
you
must
remember
it
it
was
here
yesterday
smithfield
shook
his
head
blankly
no
sir
he
said
i
ca
rightly
say
that
i
remember
it
but
inquire
for
it
crane
swore
with
an
uncontrollable
irritation
irritation
at
smithfield
for
being
so
stupid
irritation
that
he
himself
had
been
so
careless
as
to
leave
the
picture
about
among
a
houseful
of
unknown
servants
he
was
not
distracted
even
by
the
sight
of
cora
coming
downstairs
looking
very
workmanlike
in
her
habit
with
her
hat
well
down
over
her
brows
and
her
boots
over
which
brindlebury
had
evidently
expended
himself
showing
off
her
slender
feet
they
breakfasted
alone
but
burton
mind
ran
on
the
loss
of
the
miniature
and
he
did
not
really
recover
his
temper
until
he
had
mounted
cora
found
all
the
straps
of
her
skirt
adjusted
her
stirrup
loosened
the
curb
for
her
and
finally
swung
himself
up
on
his
own
hunter
a
big
ugly
chestnut
the
meet
was
and
they
were
going
to
jog
quietly
over
to
it
they
took
a
short
cut
across
the
lawn
and
at
the
sight
of
the
turf
at
the
smell
of
the
fresh
clear
morning
the
horses
began
to
dance
as
spontaneously
as
children
will
at
the
sound
of
a
street
organ
crane
and
cora
glanced
at
each
other
and
laughed
at
this
exhibition
of
high
spirits
on
the
part
of
their
darlings
no
horseman
is
proof
against
the
pleasure
of
seeing
one
of
his
treasured
animals
well
shown
by
its
rider
and
the
irish
mare
had
never
looked
as
well
as
she
now
did
under
cora
skilful
management
he
told
her
so
praising
her
hands
her
appearance
her
understanding
of
the
mind
and
she
very
fittingly
replied
with
flattery
of
the
mare
and
of
crane
own
remarkable
powers
of
selection
they
were
getting
on
so
well
that
burton
found
himself
saying
earnestly
you
really
must
stay
on
as
long
as
i
do
cora
do
let
your
mother
take
you
away
as
she
wants
to
the
girl
surprise
actually
checked
the
mare
in
her
stride
my
mother
is
thinking
of
going
away
she
cried
well
of
course
he
wanted
her
to
stay
wanted
her
even
to
want
to
stay
but
somehow
he
did
not
want
her
to
be
so
much
terrified
at
the
thought
of
departure
did
not
want
her
black
eyes
to
open
upon
him
with
such
manifest
horror
at
the
bare
idea
of
departure
he
suggested
sending
the
horses
along
a
little
and
they
cantered
side
by
side
on
the
grass
at
the
roadside
crane
kept
casting
the
glances
of
a
lover
not
at
cora
but
at
the
black
mare
as
she
arched
her
neck
to
a
light
touch
on
the
curb
so
that
the
sunlight
ran
in
iridescent
colors
along
her
crest
presently
they
saw
two
horsemen
ahead
of
them
one
of
them
in
that
pink
that
to
hunting
eyes
makes
the
most
beautiful
piece
of
color
imaginable
against
the
autumn
fields
that
eliot
the
master
cried
crane
the
hounds
must
be
just
ahead
he
a
nice
old
fellow
let
join
him
i
ca
make
out
who
the
other
one
is
no
one
who
was
out
the
last
time
we
hunted
the
canter
had
given
cora
a
color
she
looked
straight
before
her
for
a
moment
and
then
she
said
i
think
i
recognize
that
other
man
who
is
it
some
one
i
should
like
you
to
know
burt
his
name
is
lefferts
the
lane
was
now
too
narrow
for
four
to
ride
abreast
crane
drew
eliot
to
his
side
he
wanted
to
ask
him
about
the
for
since
the
disappearance
of
the
miniature
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
investigate
the
references
of
his
staff
but
strange
to
say
eliot
had
never
heard
of
the
billingtons
of
their
collection
of
tapestry
or
their
villa
at
capri
he
wished
to
talk
of
the
revellys
a
great
loss
they
are
to
the
county
crane
though
of
course
we
gain
you
i
wonder
where
they
are
gone
north
i
heard
though
i
thought
i
saw
one
of
the
boys
out
the
morning
of
the
day
you
came
the
revellys
will
hunt
anything
from
a
to
a
thoroughbred
hard
up
you
know
glad
they
consented
to
rent
their
house
did
suppose
they
ever
would
too
proud
you
know
they
have
things
in
it
of
immense
value
portrait
of
the
grandfather
marshall
revelly
second
in
command
to
stonewall
jackson
at
one
time
i
like
to
have
you
know
them
paul
the
elder
brother
is
a
man
of
some
ability
may
make
his
mark
and
the
younger
daughter
miss
claudia
revelly
do
what
he
would
voice
changed
slightly
in
pronouncing
the
miss
claudia
is
one
of
our
great
beauties
the
recipient
of
a
great
deal
of
attention
why
sir
last
summer
when
daniel
williams
the
of
this
state
saw
miss
claudia
at
but
the
story
in
which
to
be
candid
crane
did
not
take
a
great
deal
of
interest
was
interrupted
by
cora
who
pushed
her
mare
forward
in
order
to
attract
crane
attention
and
to
introduce
him
to
her
companion
the
young
man
was
extraordinarily
his
eyes
were
a
strange
color
like
the
water
in
the
dock
of
a
city
ferry
his
skin
was
ivory
in
hue
and
as
smooth
as
a
woman
but
his
hands
and
a
certain
decisiveness
of
gesture
were
virile
in
the
extreme
we
ought
to
have
a
good
run
said
crane
in
order
to
say
something
if
any
run
can
be
good
answered
the
young
man
you
do
like
hunting
i
hate
anything
to
do
with
horses
answered
lefferts
plaintively
you
must
admit
they
are
particularly
unintelligent
animals
if
they
were
of
course
they
would
let
us
bully
them
and
ride
them
about
when
they
could
do
anything
they
wanted
with
us
no
i
only
do
it
because
she
he
nodded
toward
miss
falkener
makes
me
cora
looking
very
handsome
laughed
he
a
poet
she
said
is
that
why
he
has
to
hunt
asked
crane
and
he
wondered
if
poetry
had
anything
to
do
with
the
excellence
of
the
young
man
coat
and
boots
yes
poets
have
to
be
athletic
nowadays
it
the
fashion
and
a
very
good
one
too
there
are
other
forms
of
athletics
i
do
hate
nearly
as
much
lefferts
went
on
to
crane
swimming
for
instance
and
sailing
and
even
walking
is
so
bad
it
does
need
so
much
preparation
and
getting
up
early
in
the
morning
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
fortunately
i
know
what
best
for
him
said
cora
she
makes
me
think
she
does
said
the
poet
still
plaintively
crane
wanted
to
ask
cora
where
and
how
she
had
acquired
this
rather
agreeable
responsibility
but
he
had
no
opportunity
before
they
were
off
he
and
cora
started
together
less
perhaps
from
chivalry
on
part
than
because
of
his
desire
to
watch
the
performance
of
the
mare
but
in
the
course
of
the
run
they
became
separated
and
he
finally
jogged
home
alone
he
dismounted
in
the
and
stood
watching
one
of
the
grooms
loosening
the
while
he
and
the
head
man
discussed
the
excellent
conduct
of
his
own
horses
as
compared
with
the
really
pitiable
showing
of
other
people
and
debated
whether
the
wretched
deterioration
in
a
certain
canadian
bay
horse
ridden
that
day
by
the
master
of
hounds
was
owing
to
naturally
poor
conformation
on
the
part
of
the
horse
or
deplorable
lack
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
rider
in
the
midst
of
these
absorbing
topics
crane
suddenly
became
aware
that
smithfield
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
gateway
he
stopped
short
in
what
he
was
saying
you
wanted
to
speak
to
me
smithfield
when
you
finished
sir
crane
had
finished
he
said
and
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
house
with
the
butler
at
his
side
there
been
a
terrible
disturbance
at
the
house
sir
since
you
went
out
this
morning
oh
my
powers
cried
burton
what
has
been
happening
now
smithfield
was
stepping
along
throwing
out
his
feet
and
resting
on
the
ball
of
his
foot
with
the
walk
that
falkener
had
so
much
admired
well
sir
he
said
the
trouble
has
been
between
tucker
and
brindlebury
crane
groaned
i
do
defend
the
boy
sir
i
fear
he
forgot
his
place
look
here
smithfield
said
crane
candidly
now
what
is
the
matter
with
all
of
you
you
know
you
really
are
a
very
queer
lot
thus
appealed
to
smithfield
considered
well
sir
he
said
i
think
the
trouble
as
much
as
any
one
thing
is
the
trouble
is
that
we
young
and
servants
ought
to
be
young
they
should
be
strong
healthy
hard
working
but
not
young
for
youth
means
impulses
hopes
of
improvement
love
of
enjoyment
all
qualities
servants
must
not
have
the
man
spoke
entirely
without
bitterness
and
crane
turning
to
him
said
suddenly
smithfield
what
do
you
think
about
class
distinctions
for
the
first
time
smithfield
smiled
i
think
sir
he
said
that
if
they
were
done
away
with
i
should
lose
my
job
well
by
heaven
if
i
were
you
then
cried
crane
with
unusual
feeling
i
get
a
job
that
was
dependent
on
a
lie
for
if
i
believe
anything
it
is
that
all
these
dissimilarities
between
rich
and
poor
and
men
and
women
and
black
and
white
are
pretty
trivial
as
compared
with
their
similarities
it
my
opinion
we
are
all
very
much
alike
smithfield
and
crane
as
he
spoke
was
astonished
at
the
passion
for
democracy
that
stirred
within
him
that
sir
replied
smithfield
if
you
forgive
my
saying
it
is
the
attitude
toward
democracy
of
some
one
who
has
always
been
at
the
top
there
must
be
distinctions
must
there
sir
and
you
would
probably
say
that
the
ideal
distinction
was
along
the
line
of
merit
that
every
one
should
have
the
place
in
the
world
that
he
deserves
but
dear
me
sir
that
would
be
very
cruel
so
many
of
us
would
then
be
face
to
face
with
our
own
inferiority
now
as
things
are
i
can
think
that
it
only
outside
conditions
that
are
keeping
me
down
and
that
i
should
make
as
good
or
even
better
a
master
begging
your
pardon
than
you
sir
but
under
a
true
democracy
if
i
were
still
in
an
inferior
position
i
should
have
to
admit
i
belonged
there
which
i
do
admit
at
all
now
not
at
all
but
how
about
my
not
admitting
that
i
a
master
said
crane
in
one
sense
perhaps
you
are
not
sir
answered
smithfield
for
after
all
some
training
is
necessary
to
be
a
servant
particularly
a
butler
but
for
the
exercise
of
the
functions
of
the
higher
classes
no
training
at
all
seems
to
be
required
curious
is
it
sir
utterly
unskilled
labor
is
found
only
among
the
very
rich
and
the
very
poor
the
conversation
had
brought
them
to
the
house
without
the
case
of
brindlebury
having
been
further
discussed
suddenly
realizing
this
crane
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
now
what
is
it
that
happened
he
asked
smithfield
showed
some
embarrassment
i
afraid
sir
he
said
that
some
rather
hot
words
passed
in
fact
i
do
so
much
regret
it
sir
but
i
fear
brindlebury
actually
raised
his
hand
against
mr
tucker
it
was
a
triumph
of
that
not
a
muscle
of
burton
face
quivered
at
this
intelligence
if
that
is
true
he
said
the
boy
will
have
to
go
of
course
i
had
hoped
you
might
wish
to
hear
both
sides
sir
no
answered
crane
i
might
hear
what
brindlebury
had
to
say
or
i
might
understand
without
hearing
or
i
might
know
that
i
should
have
done
the
same
in
his
place
or
even
going
a
step
farther
i
might
think
him
right
to
have
done
it
but
the
fact
remains
that
i
ca
keep
a
servant
who
strikes
a
guest
of
mine
that
a
class
distinction
smithfield
but
there
it
is
smithfield
bowed
if
i
might
suggest
sir
perhaps
you
do
not
understand
rightly
how
tucker
nothing
like
that
smithfield
tell
the
boy
to
go
go
this
afternoon
pay
him
what
right
and
get
him
out
he
ran
up
the
steps
but
turned
and
added
with
a
smile
and
you
know
there
really
anything
you
could
tell
me
about
tucker
that
i
have
known
a
great
deal
longer
than
any
of
you
have
he
went
in
tucker
and
falkener
were
sitting
side
by
side
in
the
with
that
unmistakable
air
of
people
who
expect
and
have
a
right
to
expect
that
they
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
tell
their
troubles
the
only
revenge
that
crane
permitted
himself
if
indeed
revenge
can
be
used
to
describe
so
mild
a
punishment
was
that
he
continued
to
ignore
their
perfectly
obvious
grumpiness
well
he
said
you
look
cozy
hope
you
had
as
good
a
day
as
we
have
tucker
opened
his
mouth
to
say
we
have
not
but
crane
was
already
in
full
description
of
the
run
undaunted
by
the
fact
that
neither
of
his
listeners
if
they
were
indeed
listeners
could
be
induced
to
manifest
enough
interest
in
his
story
to
meet
his
eye
i
glad
some
one
has
enjoyed
the
day
said
tucker
as
crane
paused
to
light
a
cigarette
he
laid
an
unmistakable
emphasis
on
the
words
some
one
crane
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
thanks
tuck
he
said
i
believe
that
true
i
believe
you
are
glad
yes
we
had
a
good
day
three
foxes
and
your
daughter
falkener
went
like
a
bird
she
a
wonderful
horsewoman
not
only
looks
well
herself
but
makes
the
horse
look
well
too
at
this
falkener
manner
grew
distinctly
more
cheerful
and
she
asked
and
by
the
way
where
is
cora
tucker
annoyed
at
the
desertion
on
the
part
of
his
ally
pressed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
and
sighed
audibly
but
no
one
noticed
him
i
took
a
wrong
turn
in
search
of
a
short
cut
and
lost
the
rest
of
them
said
crane
but
she
be
back
directly
she
perfectly
safe
she
was
with
eliot
our
neighbor
and
a
fellow
named
lefferts
whom
she
seemed
to
know
lefferts
cried
falkener
that
man
here
o
burton
how
could
you
leave
my
daughter
in
such
company
o
solon
you
remember
i
told
you
about
that
man
tucker
nodded
shortly
he
was
going
to
take
any
interest
in
any
one
grievances
until
his
own
had
been
disposed
of
what
the
matter
with
lefferts
said
crane
he
staying
with
eliot
and
they
asked
us
all
over
to
lunch
sha
we
go
no
nowhere
that
that
young
man
is
cried
falkener
who
seemed
to
be
a
good
deal
excited
by
the
news
he
an
idler
a
waster
why
burton
she
ended
in
a
magnificent
climax
he
a
poet
so
cora
told
me
he
affects
to
be
devoted
to
cora
her
mother
went
on
bitterly
and
follows
her
about
everywhere
without
the
slightest
encouragement
on
her
part
i
can
assure
you
but
i
have
known
him
to
take
a
most
insolent
tone
about
her
the
very
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
he
was
sitting
beside
me
at
a
party
and
i
said
as
cora
came
across
the
room
with
that
magnificent
walk
of
hers
moves
like
a
ship
she
he
answered
rather
more
like
a
submarine
you
never
know
where
she
pop
up
next
yes
there
a
sort
of
practical
mystery
about
cora
very
suitable
to
modern
warfare
he
called
her
cora
behind
her
back
but
not
to
her
face
be
sure
and
very
soon
a
poem
of
his
appeared
in
one
of
the
magazines
my
love
comparing
her
to
a
submarine
i
thought
it
most
insulting
and
what
did
cora
think
asked
crane
she
hardly
read
the
thing
through
cora
is
far
too
sensible
to
pay
much
attention
to
poetry
but
poets
are
different
i
suppose
answered
crane
personally
he
was
pleased
with
the
submarine
simile
no
nor
poets
either
said
falkener
tartly
and
rising
she
hurried
away
to
see
if
by
some
fortunate
chance
her
errant
daughter
had
returned
without
letting
her
know
left
alone
crane
decided
to
give
his
friend
his
chance
well
tuck
he
said
you
look
in
fine
form
what
have
you
been
doing
since
i
went
away
i
have
not
had
a
very
agreeable
day
said
tucker
in
a
voice
so
low
and
deep
that
it
was
almost
a
growl
no
not
a
return
of
your
old
dyspepsia
i
hope
said
crane
tucker
shook
his
head
impatiently
at
breakfast
he
said
i
heard
from
falkener
who
had
heard
from
her
daughter
that
you
had
observed
the
loss
of
the
miniature
that
used
to
lie
on
this
table
such
things
can
not
be
taken
lightly
burton
the
owners
might
put
almost
any
price
on
an
article
of
that
kind
wretched
as
it
was
as
a
work
of
art
and
you
would
be
forced
to
pay
you
see
it
could
not
be
replaced
i
thought
it
my
duty
therefore
to
send
for
each
of
the
servants
and
question
them
on
the
subject
you
thought
it
your
duty
to
send
for
tuck
again
tucker
frowned
i
said
i
sent
for
all
of
the
servants
smithfield
displayed
to
my
mind
a
most
suspicious
ignorance
and
indifference
to
the
whole
subject
the
housemaid
was
so
hysterical
and
frightened
that
if
i
did
not
know
a
great
deal
of
such
cases
i
should
suspect
her
and
was
the
cook
frightened
said
crane
with
a
flicker
of
a
smile
no
tucker
explained
she
did
not
appear
to
be
frightened
but
then
i
may
tell
you
that
i
do
not
suspect
the
cook
of
complicity
in
the
theft
the
deuce
you
do
said
crane
he
found
himself
suddenly
annoyed
without
reason
that
tucker
should
have
been
interviewing
and
questioning
his
servants
during
his
absence
stirring
up
trouble
he
said
to
himself
and
perhaps
hurting
the
feelings
of
a
perfectly
good
cook
suppose
she
had
decided
to
leave
as
a
result
of
these
activities
of
solon
he
found
he
had
not
been
listening
to
the
account
his
friend
was
giving
of
the
conversation
until
he
heard
him
say
it
seems
had
never
been
in
this
room
before
she
was
very
much
interested
in
everything
i
saw
her
looking
at
that
splendid
portrait
of
general
revelly
and
she
asked
in
fact
she
made
me
give
her
quite
a
little
account
of
his
life
a
little
lecture
on
the
civil
war
eh
said
crane
his
tone
was
not
wholly
friendly
and
tucker
did
not
find
it
so
he
colored
really
burton
he
said
coldly
in
case
of
crime
or
of
theft
a
man
lawyer
is
usually
supposed
to
know
what
it
is
best
to
do
possibly
but
i
see
no
point
in
having
dragged
the
cook
into
it
i
see
even
less
point
in
treating
her
on
a
different
plane
from
any
of
the
other
servants
it
almost
seems
tuck
as
if
you
enjoyed
your
constant
interviews
with
her
that
is
just
i
regret
to
say
burton
what
i
was
thinking
about
you
it
seems
to
me
said
crane
that
this
discussion
is
not
leading
anywhere
and
might
as
well
end
one
moment
exclaimed
the
other
my
story
is
not
finished
when
it
came
to
be
the
turn
of
that
boy
brindlebury
in
whom
i
may
as
well
tell
you
i
have
no
confidence
whatever
his
manner
was
so
insolent
his
refusal
to
answer
my
questions
so
suspicious
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
your
burton
attempted
to
knock
me
down
and
i
had
of
course
to
put
him
out
of
the
room
the
situation
is
perfectly
simple
i
must
ask
you
either
to
dismiss
him
or
to
order
the
motor
to
take
me
to
the
train
there
was
a
short
pause
during
which
crane
very
deliberately
lit
a
cigarette
then
he
said
in
a
level
tone
the
boy
is
already
dismissed
he
is
out
of
the
house
at
this
moment
probably
as
to
the
other
alternative
the
ordering
the
motor
i
will
of
course
do
that
too
if
you
insist
but
tucker
did
not
insist
on
the
contrary
he
said
you
have
done
all
i
could
desire
more
indeed
for
you
have
evidently
decided
against
the
boy
before
you
even
heard
my
side
of
the
case
one
can
not
always
decide
these
cases
with
regard
for
eternal
justice
said
crane
before
tucker
could
inquire
just
what
was
meant
by
this
rather
disagreeable
pronouncement
smithfield
appeared
in
the
doorway
to
say
that
would
be
glad
if
she
might
speak
to
crane
for
a
moment
this
was
what
crane
had
dreaded
she
was
going
to
leave
his
anger
against
tucker
flared
up
again
but
he
said
with
apparent
calmness
that
might
come
in
tucker
should
see
for
himself
the
effect
of
his
meddling
tucker
suggested
in
a
sort
of
way
that
he
would
go
away
but
his
host
told
him
shortly
to
remain
entered
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
she
was
displeased
with
the
presence
of
a
third
party
she
made
a
little
bob
of
a
curtsy
and
started
for
the
door
i
come
back
when
you
alone
sir
no
said
crane
anything
you
have
to
say
can
be
said
before
mr
tucker
oh
of
course
sir
but
her
tone
lacked
conviction
i
wanted
to
speak
about
brindlebury
he
is
very
sorry
for
what
happened
sir
i
wish
you
could
see
your
way
i
ca
said
crane
glanced
at
tucker
under
her
i
know
sir
she
went
on
that
there
could
be
no
excuse
for
the
way
he
has
acted
but
if
any
excuse
was
possible
it
did
seem
she
hesitated
you
wish
to
say
interrupted
burton
who
now
felt
he
did
not
care
what
he
said
to
any
one
that
tucker
was
extremely
provoking
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
really
burton
observed
his
guest
i
do
think
that
that
is
the
way
to
speak
of
me
particularly
he
added
firmly
to
a
servant
it
sometimes
a
good
idea
to
speak
the
truth
even
to
servants
solon
returned
crane
you
are
provoking
and
no
one
knows
it
better
than
i
have
known
it
during
the
past
fifteen
minutes
but
your
powers
of
being
provoking
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
except
theoretically
the
boy
has
got
to
go
i
want
him
to
be
out
of
the
house
within
an
hour
that
all
there
is
to
the
whole
question
but
oh
sir
if
he
is
sorry
i
doubt
very
much
if
he
is
sorry
oh
why
sir
because
i
feel
sure
that
in
his
place
i
should
be
sorry
in
the
least
except
for
having
failed
if
he
did
fail
i
know
it
a
great
liberty
sir
but
i
do
wish
you
could
give
him
another
chance
her
look
was
extraordinarily
appealing
what
in
the
world
is
brindlebury
to
you
did
tucker
tell
you
sir
he
my
brother
no
he
did
tell
me
did
you
know
he
was
brother
solon
brin
told
him
himself
sir
she
was
a
little
overeager
tucker
frowned
yes
i
believe
the
boy
did
say
something
to
that
effect
i
own
i
was
not
much
interested
in
the
fact
and
i
ca
say
i
think
it
has
any
bearing
on
the
present
situation
crane
was
silent
for
an
instant
then
he
said
no
it
has
he
got
to
go
and
then
he
added
quite
clearly
and
looking
at
his
cook
very
directly
but
i
am
sorry
not
to
be
able
to
do
anything
that
you
ask
me
to
do
she
looked
back
at
him
for
an
instant
with
a
sort
of
imperishable
sweetness
and
then
went
sadly
out
of
the
room
between
crane
and
his
legal
adviser
no
further
words
were
exchanged
crane
went
and
took
out
one
of
the
motors
and
rushed
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
over
the
country
frightening
one
or
two
sedate
black
mules
the
only
other
travelers
on
the
roads
and
soothing
his
own
irritation
by
the
rapidity
of
the
motion
more
and
more
he
regretted
not
having
been
able
to
grant
the
favor
had
so
engagingly
asked
more
and
more
he
felt
inclined
to
believe
that
in
brindlebury
place
he
would
have
done
the
same
thing
more
and
more
did
he
feel
disposed
to
fasten
upon
tucker
all
the
disagreeableness
of
the
situation
vii
he
did
not
get
back
until
almost
dinner
time
the
meal
was
not
an
agreeable
one
though
part
of
the
performance
was
no
less
perfectly
achieved
than
usual
it
was
evident
that
there
had
been
a
scene
between
the
two
ladies
cora
eyes
were
distinctly
red
and
though
falkener
bore
no
such
evidence
she
looked
more
haggard
than
was
her
wont
tucker
was
still
feeling
somewhat
imposed
upon
smithfield
manner
suggested
a
dignified
rebuke
crane
felt
no
inclination
to
lighten
the
general
tone
and
altogether
the
occasion
was
dreary
in
the
extreme
as
soon
as
they
had
had
coffee
cora
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
drawing
burton
to
her
by
a
request
for
more
light
she
whispered
wo
you
take
me
out
in
the
garden
i
have
something
i
must
say
to
you
crane
acquiesced
it
was
a
splendid
misty
november
night
the
moonlight
was
of
that
color
which
so
often
represented
on
the
stage
is
seldom
seen
in
nature
the
moon
concealed
the
bareness
of
the
lent
a
suggestion
of
mystery
to
the
thickets
of
what
had
once
been
flowering
shrubs
and
made
the
columns
of
the
piazza
which
in
the
daytime
showed
themselves
most
plainly
to
be
but
wood
appear
almost
like
the
marble
portico
of
an
ionic
temple
the
air
was
so
still
that
from
the
stables
almost
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
one
of
the
horses
kicking
in
its
stall
and
the
tune
that
a
groom
was
rather
unskilfully
deducing
from
a
concertina
crane
whistled
the
air
softly
as
he
strolled
along
by
his
side
until
she
stopped
and
said
with
great
intensity
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
burton
i
not
happy
i
horribly
distressed
i
ought
not
to
say
what
i
going
to
say
at
least
the
general
idea
seems
to
be
that
girls
should
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
you
really
my
friend
a
friend
to
whom
i
can
speak
frankly
even
about
things
that
concern
me
you
make
no
mistake
there
cora
he
returned
he
was
what
is
considered
a
brave
man
with
calm
nerves
and
quick
judgment
physical
danger
had
a
certain
stimulating
effect
upon
him
morally
too
he
did
not
lack
courage
though
inclined
to
have
everything
as
pleasant
as
possible
he
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
to
make
himself
disagreeable
but
now
at
the
thought
of
what
miss
falkener
was
going
to
say
to
him
he
was
frankly
and
unmistakably
terrified
why
he
asked
himself
young
and
timid
girls
could
go
through
such
scenes
and
it
was
said
actually
enjoy
them
why
should
he
be
unreasoningly
terrified
terrified
with
the
same
instinctive
desire
to
run
away
that
some
people
feel
when
they
see
snakes
or
spiders
why
should
he
feel
as
if
prison
walls
were
closing
about
him
two
years
ago
when
you
and
i
first
began
to
see
each
other
miss
falkener
went
on
in
a
voice
that
she
kept
dropping
lower
and
lower
in
order
to
conceal
its
tremors
i
liked
you
at
once
burton
i
liked
you
very
much
but
aside
from
that
you
know
i
not
always
very
happy
with
my
mother
aside
from
liking
you
i
made
up
my
mind
in
the
most
mercenary
way
that
the
best
thing
i
could
do
was
to
marry
you
well
i
call
that
a
thoroughly
kind
thought
said
crane
smiling
at
her
as
a
martyr
might
make
a
little
joke
about
the
lions
it
was
kind
said
cora
it
was
just
selfish
i
supposed
i
would
be
able
to
make
you
happy
but
really
i
thought
very
little
about
you
in
the
matter
i
was
thinking
only
of
myself
but
i
been
well
repaid
for
it
she
stopped
almost
with
a
sob
and
while
she
was
silently
struggling
for
sufficient
to
continue
crane
became
aware
that
the
front
door
had
opened
letting
a
sudden
shaft
of
yellow
light
fall
upon
them
through
the
green
moonshine
and
that
tucker
had
come
out
on
the
piazza
he
was
looking
about
he
was
looking
for
them
not
a
sound
did
burton
make
but
if
concentration
of
thought
has
any
unseen
power
he
drew
tucker
gaze
to
them
burton
said
tucker
there
was
no
answer
burton
he
called
again
miss
falkener
raised
her
head
some
one
called
you
she
said
then
crane
figure
became
less
rigid
and
he
moved
a
step
forward
he
was
saved
for
the
time
at
least
want
me
tuck
he
said
solon
came
down
the
steps
carefully
he
had
reached
an
age
when
the
eye
does
not
quickly
adjust
itself
to
changes
of
light
yes
he
said
i
do
want
to
see
you
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question
did
you
or
did
you
not
assure
me
the
boy
brindlebury
had
left
the
house
i
did
so
assure
you
answered
crane
and
i
had
been
so
foolish
as
to
hope
we
had
heard
the
last
of
him
smithfield
told
me
before
dinner
that
he
left
early
in
the
afternoon
smithfield
lied
to
you
the
boy
is
in
bed
in
his
own
room
at
this
moment
how
do
you
know
go
and
see
for
yourself
crane
was
just
angry
enough
at
every
one
to
welcome
any
action
only
a
few
seconds
elapsed
before
he
was
in
the
servants
wing
of
the
house
all
the
doors
were
standing
open
disclosing
black
darkness
except
one
which
was
closed
and
under
this
a
bright
streak
was
visible
crane
flung
himself
upon
this
thinking
it
would
be
locked
but
evidently
brindlebury
had
not
thought
any
such
precaution
necessary
the
door
at
once
yielded
and
crane
entered
brindlebury
fully
dressed
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
on
the
bed
with
his
legs
crossed
in
the
air
a
cigarette
was
in
his
mouth
one
of
burton
cigarettes
a
was
at
his
elbow
and
he
was
engaged
in
the
perusal
of
a
new
novel
which
crane
had
received
the
day
before
and
had
strangely
missed
ever
since
on
the
floor
was
a
tray
empty
indeed
but
bearing
unmistakable
signs
of
having
been
well
filled
only
recently
crane
took
the
cigarette
from
brindlebury
mouth
and
the
book
from
his
hand
now
he
said
i
give
you
five
minutes
to
get
your
things
together
and
get
out
there
were
no
signs
that
packing
had
ever
been
contemplated
all
brindlebury
belongings
were
undisturbed
the
boy
looked
at
crane
he
would
like
to
have
answered
but
he
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
so
he
got
up
slowly
and
tried
to
smooth
his
hair
which
was
very
much
rumpled
i
not
positive
i
have
such
a
thing
as
a
bag
he
observed
at
length
but
a
little
search
revealed
one
in
the
closet
it
was
marked
b
revelly
a
token
of
respect
from
your
late
employer
i
suppose
said
crane
the
boy
did
not
answer
he
was
rather
sulkily
putting
on
his
clothes
he
was
not
a
neat
packer
a
and
some
pipe
tobacco
a
wet
sponge
and
some
clean
shirts
boots
and
pajamas
were
indiscriminately
mixed
the
five
minutes
unmarked
by
any
conversation
had
almost
elapsed
when
light
steps
were
heard
in
the
hallway
and
a
voice
exclaimed
did
you
have
a
good
dinner
honey
and
came
spinning
into
the
room
all
the
demureness
gone
from
her
manner
at
the
sight
of
her
employer
she
stopped
and
her
hand
went
up
to
her
mouth
with
a
gesture
expressive
of
the
utmost
horror
brindlebury
did
not
stop
packing
he
was
now
filling
in
the
corners
with
shaving
soap
and
socks
his
sister
turned
to
crane
oh
sir
she
wailed
we
acted
very
wrongly
replied
crane
that
really
does
go
it
was
a
good
manner
and
you
worked
it
well
but
it
is
now
if
you
will
forgive
my
saying
so
old
stuff
i
can
not
look
upon
you
as
a
foolishly
fond
sister
trying
to
protect
an
erring
brother
i
think
it
far
more
likely
that
you
are
the
organizer
of
this
efficient
little
plan
to
keep
him
here
unobserved
eating
my
food
reading
my
books
and
smoking
if
i
am
not
greatly
mistaken
my
cigarettes
oh
brin
do
you
take
crane
cigarettes
said
not
unless
i
out
of
my
own
said
her
brother
without
clearing
his
own
honesty
he
impugns
my
taste
said
crane
it
was
plain
that
was
going
to
make
another
effort
to
improve
the
situation
she
was
thinking
hard
at
last
she
began
illustration
at
the
sight
of
crane
stopped
with
a
gesture
of
the
utmost
horror
i
do
defend
what
we
done
sir
but
if
you
would
have
let
me
see
you
alone
this
afternoon
i
was
going
to
ask
that
brindlebury
might
stay
just
for
this
one
night
only
i
could
speak
before
tucker
i
so
afraid
of
him
there
you
go
again
said
burton
you
not
telling
the
truth
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
tucker
well
not
as
much
as
i
am
of
you
sir
said
crane
i
believe
you
are
a
very
naughty
girl
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
every
trace
of
ill
temper
had
left
him
i
know
what
you
mean
sir
said
the
cook
and
this
time
her
voice
had
a
certain
commonplace
tone
and
it
true
i
have
always
been
perfectly
honest
with
you
but
a
servant
ca
be
candid
and
open
sir
you
know
yourself
it
would
do
i
like
to
see
it
tried
returned
crane
well
i
honest
now
sir
she
went
on
in
asking
you
to
let
brin
stay
he
apologize
i
sure
i
will
not
said
the
boy
still
packing
but
his
sister
hardly
noticed
the
interruption
he
will
do
what
i
tell
him
when
he
comes
to
think
it
over
if
you
will
only
relent
do
you
think
you
are
just
a
little
hard
on
him
he
is
my
brother
and
it
would
make
me
so
happy
if
you
would
let
him
stay
the
desire
to
make
others
happy
is
not
a
crime
yet
crane
felt
nothing
but
shame
at
the
obvious
weakening
of
his
own
resolution
under
the
peculiarly
melting
voice
of
he
glanced
at
the
boy
he
thought
of
tucker
he
looked
long
at
who
knows
what
might
have
happened
if
his
eyes
which
he
decided
he
must
wrench
away
from
hers
had
not
suddenly
fallen
upon
a
small
object
lying
undisguised
on
brindlebury
it
was
the
pearl
set
miniature
all
three
saw
it
almost
at
the
same
instant
the
hands
of
all
went
out
toward
it
but
crane
reached
it
first
he
took
it
up
have
you
any
explanation
to
offer
brindlebury
he
said
i
can
explain
exclaimed
i
sure
you
can
crane
answered
the
only
question
is
shall
i
believe
your
explanation
he
took
it
because
it
reminded
him
of
me
that
the
only
reason
he
wanted
it
crane
looked
from
the
miniature
to
the
cook
he
knew
that
this
was
also
the
only
reason
why
he
himself
wanted
it
he
said
go
downstairs
and
order
the
motor
to
come
to
the
side
door
at
once
crane
you
not
going
to
have
brin
arrested
he
shook
his
head
i
ought
to
perhaps
but
i
am
not
going
to
i
going
to
take
him
in
the
motor
to
what
i
consider
a
safe
distance
and
drop
him
just
like
a
stray
cat
gasped
brindlebury
sister
cats
usually
come
back
said
the
boy
with
a
return
of
his
normal
spirits
cats
have
nine
lives
replied
crane
significantly
something
about
the
tone
of
this
remark
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
obediently
left
the
room
brindlebury
struggled
frantically
to
strap
his
bulging
bag
and
succeeded
only
with
the
assistance
of
crane
when
they
went
downstairs
the
motor
was
already
ticking
quietly
at
the
side
door
no
one
was
visible
except
who
was
wistfully
watching
it
brindlebury
got
in
and
set
his
bag
upright
between
his
knees
crane
got
in
and
had
actually
released
the
brake
when
looking
up
at
the
cook
still
standing
there
he
found
himself
saying
do
you
want
to
come
too
to
see
the
last
of
your
brother
of
course
she
did
she
looked
hastily
about
and
then
turned
toward
the
stairs
but
crane
stopped
her
no
he
said
do
go
up
there
a
coat
of
mine
there
in
the
coat
closet
take
that
immediately
she
reappeared
in
a
heavy
irish
frieze
overcoat
he
had
had
made
that
spring
in
new
bond
street
it
was
an
easy
fit
for
crane
it
enveloped
completely
the
collar
which
she
had
contrived
to
turn
up
as
she
put
the
coat
on
stood
level
with
the
top
of
her
head
the
hem
trailed
on
the
ground
and
the
sleeves
hung
limp
from
below
the
elbows
she
looked
like
a
very
small
kitten
wrapped
up
in
a
very
large
baby
blanket
but
she
did
not
allow
this
superfluity
of
cloth
to
hamper
her
movements
she
sprang
into
the
little
back
seat
and
they
started
after
about
half
an
hour
crane
stopped
the
car
they
were
now
in
the
outskirts
of
the
main
town
of
the
district
this
is
where
you
get
out
he
said
brindlebury
obeyed
smithfield
paid
you
your
wages
i
believe
and
burton
plunged
into
his
own
pocket
well
there
something
extra
at
this
a
trembling
might
have
been
seen
in
the
right
sleeve
of
the
frieze
coat
and
the
next
second
hand
emerged
from
the
cuff
and
crane
for
the
first
time
experienced
the
touch
of
her
fingers
she
pushed
his
hand
away
from
her
brother
do
take
that
money
brin
she
cried
brindlebury
hand
dropped
no
of
course
not
what
do
you
take
me
for
he
said
then
he
snatched
off
his
cap
and
kissed
his
sister
and
picking
up
his
bag
he
disappeared
into
the
darkness
there
was
a
moment
silence
between
the
other
two
before
crane
said
better
get
into
the
front
seat
you
be
more
comfortable
holding
up
her
coat
as
if
it
were
a
coronation
robe
stepped
in
sat
down
and
wrapped
it
carefully
about
her
knees
a
process
in
which
crane
by
the
greatest
effort
of
did
not
join
again
the
brake
squeaked
and
the
motor
moved
forward
a
great
deal
has
been
said
about
silence
as
a
method
of
spiritual
communion
but
few
of
us
in
social
situations
at
least
have
the
courage
of
these
convictions
most
hostesses
on
looking
about
a
silent
would
be
more
apt
to
think
that
they
were
watching
a
suspension
of
diplomatic
relations
rather
than
an
intercommunication
of
souls
but
there
are
moments
for
all
of
us
when
we
value
silence
as
highly
as
maeterlinck
himself
and
this
in
burton
opinion
was
one
of
them
the
moonlight
so
much
more
beautiful
and
affecting
than
he
had
found
it
earlier
in
the
evening
in
the
garden
the
smooth
quick
motion
the
damp
night
air
blowing
against
his
face
made
him
acutely
aware
of
the
presence
at
his
side
of
that
small
still
companion
he
felt
no
need
of
speech
nor
did
he
speculate
as
to
her
state
of
mind
he
drove
and
enjoyed
life
deeply
they
were
nearly
at
home
again
before
he
asked
why
was
it
you
did
not
wish
your
brother
to
take
what
i
offered
him
because
she
answered
in
a
tone
of
simplicity
and
sincerity
he
had
never
yet
heard
from
her
it
would
not
have
been
good
for
him
young
and
takes
things
too
easily
he
ought
not
to
have
money
he
does
not
work
for
i
am
glad
that
you
feel
like
that
he
said
i
was
afraid
you
refused
to
let
him
have
it
because
you
were
angry
at
me
for
sending
him
away
he
was
afraid
that
she
would
relapse
into
her
old
tone
of
mock
servility
and
assure
him
that
she
would
never
be
guilty
of
the
liberty
of
criticizing
her
employer
but
she
did
not
she
said
but
i
was
not
angry
at
you
i
should
not
have
respected
you
if
you
had
done
anything
else
he
answered
seriously
you
knew
that
i
was
sorry
not
to
do
what
you
asked
me
to
do
yes
i
knew
she
said
they
did
not
speak
again
they
left
the
car
at
the
garage
and
walked
to
the
house
there
had
been
failure
in
coöperation
for
smithfield
evidently
had
not
known
of
the
expedition
the
side
door
was
locked
and
so
was
the
front
door
i
suppose
i
better
ring
said
crane
reluctantly
somehow
he
was
not
eager
to
face
smithfield
cold
reproving
glance
no
follow
me
whispered
she
led
him
to
the
kitchen
entrance
and
pointed
to
a
window
i
do
believe
that
window
has
had
a
bolt
for
sixty
years
she
said
and
to
think
returned
crane
as
he
gently
raised
it
that
before
i
took
the
house
i
complained
of
its
being
out
of
repair
he
climbed
in
and
opened
the
kitchen
door
for
her
he
had
a
match
and
she
knew
the
whereabouts
of
a
candle
they
still
spoke
in
whispers
there
was
of
course
no
real
reason
why
they
were
so
eager
to
let
the
household
sleep
undisturbed
yet
they
were
obviously
united
in
the
resolution
to
make
no
unnecessary
sound
would
you
like
something
to
eat
breathed
a
good
idea
he
answered
she
divested
herself
of
his
coat
and
beckoned
him
to
the
they
had
entirely
ceased
to
be
master
and
servant
some
of
that
chicken
salad
you
had
for
dinner
she
murmured
if
any
of
it
came
down
i
dare
say
it
did
though
smithfield
so
fond
of
it
crane
laughed
you
mean
he
eats
in
the
pantry
she
nodded
all
butlers
do
and
smithfield
a
little
bit
greedy
though
never
guess
it
would
you
they
laughed
softly
over
smithfield
as
they
spread
out
their
simple
meal
on
the
kitchen
table
showed
a
faint
disposition
to
wait
upon
her
employer
but
it
was
easily
vanquished
by
his
assertion
that
he
would
eat
nothing
unless
she
sat
down
too
a
few
minutes
later
it
was
he
who
was
doing
whatever
work
was
to
be
done
and
she
sitting
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
watching
him
there
seemed
after
all
nothing
unnatural
in
this
new
relation
presently
willoughby
hearing
the
sound
of
dishes
or
smelling
the
chicken
salad
awoke
and
jumped
on
the
table
do
you
mind
him
asked
his
mistress
in
melting
tones
crane
did
mind
him
at
all
he
offered
the
cat
a
bit
of
chicken
willoughby
seemed
to
enjoy
it
chewing
it
with
quick
little
jerks
of
his
head
and
presently
he
raised
a
paw
and
deflected
a
fork
which
crane
was
carrying
to
his
own
mouth
even
this
crane
appeared
to
find
amusing
before
they
had
finished
the
kitchen
clock
behind
them
suddenly
and
discordantly
struck
once
burton
started
and
half
turned
his
head
but
she
stopped
him
let
guess
what
time
it
is
she
said
of
course
it
later
than
half
past
ten
it
might
be
half
past
eleven
or
even
half
past
twelve
it
could
be
one
but
certainly
not
half
past
they
looked
around
it
was
half
past
sprang
up
oh
how
dreadful
she
exclaimed
without
however
any
very
real
conviction
how
terribly
late
and
i
have
to
get
up
so
early
in
the
morning
it
makes
me
desperately
ashamed
said
crane
to
think
you
have
to
get
up
to
cook
for
all
of
us
and
that
i
can
sleep
just
as
late
as
i
want
to
she
laughed
if
you
have
anything
worse
to
worry
about
than
that
you
very
lucky
but
he
had
something
to
worry
about
and
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
he
began
to
worry
about
it
namely
the
painful
and
complicated
situation
of
a
man
who
has
fallen
in
love
with
his
cook
viii
falkener
never
came
down
to
breakfast
at
nine
to
the
minute
her
bell
tinkled
and
lily
staggered
up
to
her
room
bearing
a
tray
from
which
it
subsequently
appeared
many
essentials
had
been
forgotten
the
next
ten
minutes
were
spent
by
the
unfortunate
housemaid
in
trips
to
the
pantry
in
search
of
salt
powdered
sugar
or
a
cora
however
came
down
and
poured
out
coffee
for
the
two
men
she
looked
handsome
and
vigorous
in
this
occupation
and
crane
sitting
opposite
to
her
wondered
if
it
were
his
destiny
to
sit
so
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
watched
her
thin
white
hands
strong
as
steel
they
were
moving
about
among
the
cups
he
had
once
admired
them
intensely
but
now
he
knew
that
hands
did
not
have
to
be
so
firm
and
muscular
to
accomplish
wonderful
achievements
in
all
sorts
of
ways
at
ten
falkener
came
swimming
down
the
stairs
all
suavity
and
brightness
the
evening
before
while
crane
had
been
struggling
with
the
problem
of
brindlebury
misdeeds
she
and
tucker
had
had
another
council
of
war
a
new
attack
upon
the
cook
had
been
planned
which
they
felt
sure
would
bring
to
light
delinquencies
that
even
crane
could
not
overlook
come
burton
she
said
as
she
entered
the
are
you
ever
going
to
offer
to
show
me
the
kitchen
you
know
that
to
an
housekeeper
like
myself
it
is
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
whole
house
such
interest
crane
felt
inclined
to
answer
was
not
confined
to
housekeepers
her
suggestion
roused
conflicting
desires
in
him
the
desire
to
see
and
the
desire
to
protect
her
from
falkener
tuck
could
tell
us
all
about
it
he
said
slyly
tucker
who
was
reading
the
paper
pretended
not
to
hear
and
presently
crane
rang
the
bell
tell
the
cook
smithfield
he
said
that
falkener
and
i
are
coming
down
to
inspect
the
kitchen
in
about
ten
minutes
when
smithfield
had
gone
falkener
shook
her
finger
at
crane
that
was
a
mistake
my
dear
burton
she
said
a
great
mistake
take
them
unaware
whenever
you
can
it
is
the
only
way
to
protect
ourselves
against
the
unscrupulous
members
of
their
class
crane
said
tucker
without
looking
up
from
his
paper
wants
to
give
the
young
woman
plenty
of
time
to
smuggle
out
any
superfluous
young
man
who
may
be
visiting
her
at
the
moment
well
i
no
man
tuck
burton
replied
leaving
all
of
his
hearers
in
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
emphasized
the
word
i
tucker
laughed
sarcastically
no
my
dear
fellow
he
answered
your
best
friend
would
not
accuse
you
of
having
talents
along
the
detective
line
perhaps
not
replied
crane
and
by
the
way
did
i
tell
you
that
the
miniature
had
turned
up
all
right
tucker
face
fell
he
had
depended
a
good
deal
on
the
loss
of
the
miniature
as
a
lever
to
oust
the
whole
set
of
servants
no
he
said
where
was
it
discovered
oh
it
had
just
been
moved
answered
crane
it
was
lying
on
another
table
when
i
happened
to
notice
it
he
took
it
out
of
his
pocket
and
looked
at
it
i
think
now
i
keep
it
in
my
room
for
safety
you
approve
of
that
do
you
tuck
tucker
who
felt
that
in
some
way
he
was
being
deceived
would
not
answer
and
in
the
pause
falkener
rose
and
said
chattily
well
shall
we
be
off
coming
with
us
solon
no
i
not
returned
tucker
crossly
did
mean
to
offend
you
crane
answered
i
thought
you
liked
kitchens
too
downstairs
they
found
the
kitchen
empty
was
standing
just
outside
the
door
watching
willoughby
who
was
exciting
himself
most
unnecessarily
over
preparations
which
he
was
making
to
catch
a
bird
that
was
hopping
about
in
the
grass
near
by
the
great
cat
crouched
all
still
except
the
end
of
his
tail
which
twitched
ominously
then
he
rose
and
balancing
himself
almost
imperceptibly
on
his
four
paws
seemed
about
to
spring
then
abandoning
this
method
too
he
crept
a
little
nearer
to
his
victim
his
stomach
almost
touching
the
earth
and
then
the
whole
exhibition
was
ended
by
the
bird
who
having
accomplished
its
foraging
expedition
lightly
flew
away
leaving
willoughby
looking
as
foolish
as
a
cat
ever
does
look
stooped
and
patted
him
you
silly
dear
she
said
caressingly
it
was
willoughby
who
first
saw
crane
with
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
previous
evening
feast
of
chicken
from
the
salad
the
cat
ran
to
him
and
bumped
his
nose
repeatedly
against
crane
legs
in
token
of
fealty
and
gratitude
burton
felt
unduly
flattered
he
lifted
willoughby
who
instantly
made
himself
very
soft
and
heavy
in
his
arms
and
showed
every
disposition
to
settle
down
and
go
to
sleep
falkener
looked
at
him
sentimentally
how
all
animals
take
to
you
burton
at
first
sight
she
said
crane
bent
over
and
replaced
willoughby
slowly
on
the
ground
while
turned
her
head
away
for
an
instant
falkener
went
on
what
a
nice
bright
kitchen
you
have
a
good
range
though
how
bright
you
keep
your
copper
that
right
she
wandered
away
in
her
tour
of
inspection
see
burton
this
blue
plate
it
looks
to
me
as
if
it
might
have
value
and
this
oak
dresser
it
must
be
two
hundred
years
old
she
was
across
the
room
and
her
back
was
turned
crane
and
the
cook
stood
looking
at
each
other
how
charming
how
interesting
falkener
continued
and
you
would
not
believe
me
when
i
said
that
the
kitchen
was
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
house
i
did
not
disagree
with
that
said
crane
still
looking
at
oh
my
dear
boy
you
would
never
have
come
down
if
i
had
not
made
you
one
does
always
do
what
one
wants
to
do
said
crane
falkener
turned
the
kitchen
had
revealed
none
of
the
enormities
she
had
expected
not
even
a
man
hidden
in
the
kitchen
closet
the
door
of
which
she
had
hopefully
opened
but
one
chance
still
remained
the
in
her
time
she
had
known
many
incriminating
she
called
loudly
to
be
taken
to
it
it
this
way
madame
said
the
cook
falkener
drew
crane
aside
that
she
said
is
the
very
best
way
to
judge
of
a
cook
economical
powers
see
how
much
she
saves
of
the
dishes
that
come
from
the
upstairs
table
now
last
night
i
happened
to
notice
that
the
chicken
salad
went
downstairs
almost
untouched
for
the
first
time
in
years
burton
found
himself
coloring
oh
really
he
stammered
i
had
an
idea
that
we
had
eaten
quite
a
lot
of
it
no
returned
falkener
firmly
no
a
good
dish
went
down
let
us
go
and
see
crane
glanced
at
he
thought
she
had
overheard
they
reached
the
the
cook
lifted
the
lid
and
falkener
looked
in
the
first
sight
that
greeted
her
eyes
was
the
platter
that
had
borne
the
salad
she
had
liked
so
much
it
was
almost
empty
why
she
said
where
is
all
the
rest
of
that
excellent
salad
at
this
question
who
was
standing
beside
the
chest
gave
the
lid
a
slight
downward
impulsion
so
that
it
suddenly
closed
with
a
loud
heavy
report
within
half
an
inch
of
falkener
nose
that
lady
turned
to
burton
burton
she
said
with
the
majesty
of
which
she
was
at
times
capable
i
leave
it
to
you
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
impossible
young
woman
did
that
on
purpose
and
so
saying
she
swept
away
up
the
stairs
like
a
goddess
reascending
olympus
look
here
said
crane
i
do
stand
for
that
oh
sir
replied
the
culprit
with
a
return
to
an
earlier
manner
you
surely
do
think
i
had
anything
to
do
with
it
unhappily
i
was
watching
your
hand
at
the
time
and
i
know
that
you
had
completely
changed
her
method
oh
well
she
said
you
did
not
want
her
going
on
any
more
about
the
old
salad
did
you
i
do
want
the
end
of
my
guest
nose
taken
off
it
rather
a
long
nose
said
the
cook
dispassionately
i
am
seriously
displeased
at
this
the
cook
had
a
new
idea
she
extracted
a
very
small
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
and
unfolded
it
as
she
said
yes
indeed
sir
i
suppose
i
did
utterly
forget
my
place
but
rather
hard
on
a
poor
girl
one
day
you
treat
her
as
if
she
were
an
empress
and
the
next
just
as
if
she
were
mud
under
your
feet
she
pressed
the
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
you
know
i
never
treated
you
like
mud
under
my
feet
it
was
only
last
night
in
my
brother
room
she
went
on
tearfully
that
you
scolded
me
for
not
being
candid
and
now
at
the
very
first
candid
thing
i
do
you
turn
on
me
like
a
lion
at
this
point
crane
removed
her
hands
and
handkerchief
from
before
her
face
and
revealed
the
fact
which
he
already
suspected
that
she
was
smiling
all
the
time
what
a
dreadful
fraud
you
are
he
said
quite
seriously
no
crane
answered
briskly
tucking
away
her
handkerchief
now
that
its
usefulness
was
over
no
i
not
exactly
a
fraud
it
just
that
that
my
way
of
enjoying
myself
and
you
know
sometimes
i
think
other
people
enjoy
it
too
do
you
think
falkener
enjoys
it
i
was
thinking
of
falkener
replied
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eyes
burton
called
falkener
voice
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
crane
and
his
cook
drew
slightly
closer
together
as
if
against
a
common
enemy
do
you
suppose
she
can
have
heard
us
he
asked
i
think
she
perfectly
capable
of
trying
to
hear
crane
smiled
i
took
a
great
risk
when
i
advised
you
to
be
candid
burton
said
the
voice
again
merciful
powers
exclaimed
crane
she
calls
like
juliet
nurse
the
cook
laughed
but
you
must
be
prompter
than
juliet
was
what
do
you
know
about
shakespeare
moving
pictures
have
been
a
great
education
to
the
lower
classes
you
know
sir
he
moved
toward
the
stairs
but
turned
back
to
say
she
answered
you
that
we
shall
ever
meet
again
and
then
even
she
seemed
to
feel
that
she
had
committed
an
imprudence
and
she
dashed
away
to
the
kitchen
crane
ascended
the
stairs
slowly
for
he
was
trying
to
recall
the
lines
that
follow
juliet
pathetic
question
when
he
suddenly
became
aware
of
falkener
feet
planted
firmly
on
the
top
step
and
then
of
that
lady
whole
majestic
presence
he
pulled
himself
together
with
an
effort
do
you
suppose
that
girl
could
have
dropped
that
lid
on
purpose
he
asked
as
if
this
were
the
question
he
had
been
so
deeply
pondering
i
feel
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
returned
falkener
he
shook
his
head
it
seems
almost
incredible
he
answered
moving
swiftly
across
the
hall
toward
the
where
tucker
and
miss
falkener
were
visible
on
the
contrary
replied
the
elder
lady
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
in
keeping
with
the
whole
conduct
of
this
extraordinary
young
person
they
had
now
entered
the
room
and
she
included
tucker
and
her
daughter
in
an
account
of
the
incident
you
know
solon
and
you
too
cora
how
easy
i
am
on
servants
i
must
admit
every
one
will
confirm
it
that
my
own
servants
adore
me
they
adore
me
do
they
cora
no
wonder
i
see
to
their
comfort
they
have
their
own
bath
and
a
far
better
than
anything
i
had
myself
as
a
young
woman
but
in
return
i
do
demand
respect
absolute
respect
and
when
i
am
looking
into
an
examining
it
at
burton
special
request
to
have
that
young
minx
slam
down
the
lid
almost
catching
my
nose
solon
i
assure
you
almost
touching
my
nose
as
she
did
it
tucker
listened
attentively
tapping
his
on
his
left
palm
then
he
said
and
what
did
you
do
about
it
burton
crane
had
gone
to
the
bookcases
and
taken
down
a
volume
of
shakespeare
he
was
so
profoundly
immersed
that
tucker
had
to
repeat
his
question
this
is
what
he
was
reading
think
you
that
we
shall
ever
meet
again
i
doubt
it
not
and
all
our
woes
shall
serve
for
pleasant
converse
in
the
days
to
come
he
looked
up
vainly
trying
to
suppress
a
smile
what
did
i
do
about
what
tuck
about
your
cook
insulting
mrs
falkener
crane
replaced
the
volume
and
walked
to
the
window
oh
he
said
i
stayed
behind
a
moment
a
moment
said
falkener
with
something
that
would
have
been
a
snort
in
one
less
at
this
instant
crane
attention
was
attracted
by
a
figure
he
saw
crossing
the
grounds
and
he
decided
to
create
a
diversion
oh
look
he
exclaimed
do
come
and
see
the
housemaid
going
out
for
a
walk
did
you
ever
see
anything
smarter
than
she
looks
the
diversion
was
of
a
more
exciting
nature
than
he
had
intended
falkener
came
to
the
window
and
uttering
a
piercing
exclamation
she
cried
the
woman
has
on
cora
best
hat
not
really
said
crane
but
it
did
seem
to
him
he
remembered
having
seen
the
hat
before
it
is
it
is
falkener
went
on
in
some
excitement
call
her
back
at
once
solon
do
something
call
the
woman
back
tucker
thus
appealed
to
threw
open
the
window
and
with
an
extremely
creditable
volume
of
voice
he
roared
lily
the
girl
started
and
turned
he
beckoned
imperiously
she
approached
come
in
here
at
once
he
said
sternly
falkener
sank
into
a
chair
this
is
really
too
much
she
said
making
fluttering
gestures
with
her
hands
even
you
burton
will
admit
this
is
too
much
stand
by
me
solon
do
say
even
i
falkener
returned
crane
as
if
i
had
been
indifferent
to
your
comfort
do
be
so
excited
mother
said
cora
you
know
it
probably
is
my
hat
at
all
lily
has
probably
been
copying
mine
falkener
shook
her
head
i
should
know
a
diane
duruy
model
anywhere
she
said
at
this
moment
lily
entered
and
good
temper
did
not
beam
from
her
countenance
i
had
permission
from
smithfield
to
go
out
she
began
defiantly
smithfield
sent
me
over
to
look
up
a
boy
to
replace
brin
the
trouble
is
not
over
your
going
out
said
crane
illustration
cora
said
crane
is
that
your
hat
what
is
the
trouble
then
the
trouble
said
falkener
seeing
crane
hesitate
for
a
word
is
that
you
have
on
my
daughter
hat
your
daughter
hat
said
lily
contemptuously
nothing
of
the
kind
falkener
turned
to
tucker
this
is
intolerable
this
is
insufferable
she
cried
to
have
that
woman
standing
there
in
cora
hat
which
i
chose
myself
and
paid
dollars
for
at
a
sale
and
cheap
too
for
a
diane
duruy
model
to
stand
there
and
tell
me
i
do
know
the
hat
when
i
see
it
cora
said
crane
is
that
your
hat
why
yes
i
afraid
it
is
answered
cora
rather
reluctantly
lily
have
you
any
explanation
to
make
he
asked
none
at
all
replied
the
housemaid
looking
like
white
granite
cora
said
crane
you
did
not
by
any
chance
say
anything
that
could
have
led
lily
to
believe
you
meant
to
give
her
the
hat
miss
falkener
smiled
no
she
said
my
mother
would
not
encourage
such
a
generous
impulse
in
regard
to
a
french
hat
then
lily
said
burton
take
off
the
hat
and
give
it
back
to
miss
falkener
and
go
and
pack
your
things
and
be
out
of
the
house
in
an
hour
you
must
have
her
luggage
searched
said
tucker
give
the
hat
back
cried
falkener
what
good
will
that
do
do
you
suppose
that
i
would
ever
let
cora
put
it
on
her
head
again
after
that
woman
has
worn
it
she
may
as
well
keep
it
now
i
shall
answered
lily
it
mine
the
girl
determination
impressed
crane
more
than
it
did
the
others
though
even
he
could
not
see
any
of
escape
for
her
he
rang
the
bell
and
when
smithfield
appeared
he
said
smithfield
i
have
dismissed
lily
we
found
her
leaving
the
house
in
one
of
miss
falkener
hats
oh
begging
your
pardon
no
sir
said
smithfield
it
is
really
not
miss
falkener
hat
surely
lily
you
explained
it
i
do
care
to
speak
to
them
at
all
answered
lily
oh
that
no
way
to
speak
to
your
employers
my
girl
said
smithfield
the
explanation
is
this
sir
i
understand
those
great
french
houses
send
out
many
hats
alike
sir
and
this
one
was
given
to
lily
by
a
friend
by
to
be
exact
sir
she
thinking
it
a
trifle
youthful
for
herself
after
she
had
bought
it
and
i
ca
but
say
she
was
right
sir
she
being
a
lady
now
nearing
sixty
though
hardly
looking
the
first
evening
the
ladies
came
sir
when
lily
had
done
unpacking
their
things
she
mentioned
in
the
kitchen
that
miss
falkener
had
a
hat
similar
to
her
own
and
we
all
advised
her
sir
under
the
circumstances
not
to
wear
it
during
the
ladies
stay
as
being
more
suitable
and
respectful
and
she
agreed
not
to
but
young
women
when
they
have
pretty
things
dear
me
sir
they
do
like
to
wear
them
and
that
i
presume
is
why
she
put
on
the
hat
in
spite
of
our
warnings
and
i
sure
she
regrets
it
heartily
sir
i
do
said
lily
i
right
glad
i
did
tut
tut
said
smithfield
no
way
to
answer
no
way
to
answer
cora
crane
said
would
you
go
up
and
see
if
your
hat
is
in
your
room
cora
agreed
and
left
the
room
at
once
complete
silence
reigned
until
she
returned
she
was
carrying
in
her
hand
a
hat
the
exact
duplicate
of
that
which
the
housemaid
wore
they
looked
from
one
to
another
lily
triumph
was
complete
lily
said
crane
an
apology
seems
to
be
due
to
you
which
i
have
great
pleasure
in
offering
you
but
i
must
say
that
if
you
had
been
just
a
trifle
more
civil
the
whole
mistake
might
have
been
cleared
up
sooner
and
more
agreeably
i
think
it
outrageous
observed
falkener
rising
i
think
it
perfectly
outrageous
that
any
servant
should
own
a
hat
which
anywhere
but
at
a
special
sale
must
have
cost
sixty
or
seventy
dollars
and
now
i
tell
you
what
i
think
outrageous
said
lily
her
soft
southern
drawl
taking
on
a
certain
vigor
and
that
is
that
women
like
you
calling
themselves
ladies
should
be
free
to
browbeat
and
insult
servants
as
much
as
they
please
shut
up
lily
said
smithfield
but
she
paid
no
attention
no
she
said
no
one
knows
what
i
put
up
with
from
this
insolent
old
harridan
and
now
i
am
going
to
say
what
i
think
oh
no
lily
said
crane
taking
her
by
the
arm
you
really
are
not
we
all
sorry
for
the
incident
but
really
you
know
you
ca
be
allowed
to
talk
like
that
but
crane
drawled
lily
you
do
appreciate
what
a
dreadful
woman
she
is
no
one
could
who
did
not
have
to
hook
her
up
every
evening
between
smithfield
and
crane
she
was
hustled
out
of
the
room
alone
in
the
hall
crane
and
his
butler
held
a
consultation
she
got
to
go
smithfield
why
in
the
world
would
she
hold
her
tongue
poor
girl
i
felt
every
sympathy
with
her
oh
sir
exclaimed
smithfield
what
shall
we
do
and
i
really
ca
run
the
house
entirely
alone
sir
of
course
not
of
course
not
burton
answered
you
must
get
some
more
servants
get
as
many
as
you
please
black
white
or
red
but
for
heaven
sake
get
the
kind
that
wo
be
impertinent
to
mrs
falkener
smithfield
shook
his
head
that
a
kind
will
be
hard
to
find
sir
begging
your
pardon
he
observed
crane
thought
it
best
to
ignore
this
remark
i
tell
you
what
to
do
he
said
call
up
eliot
and
say
we
should
all
be
glad
to
accept
his
invitation
to
lunch
if
he
can
still
have
us
that
will
give
you
a
little
time
to
look
about
you
by
you
ought
to
be
able
to
find
some
one
he
waited
to
get
eliot
answer
before
he
returned
to
the
where
he
saw
that
tucker
and
falkener
had
had
a
long
comfortable
talk
about
their
grievances
and
their
own
general
righteousness
he
hated
to
break
into
the
calm
that
had
succeeded
by
announcing
that
they
were
all
going
out
to
lunch
burton
said
falkener
directing
a
stern
glance
at
her
daughter
i
explained
to
you
yesterday
that
was
an
invitation
i
did
not
care
to
accept
i
know
said
crane
but
my
household
is
now
so
that
it
seemed
a
question
of
lunching
out
or
getting
no
lunch
at
all
if
you
really
object
to
going
to
eliot
i
dare
say
they
could
give
you
something
cold
at
home
if
you
did
not
mind
that
you
will
come
you
cora
with
pleasure
answered
cora
crane
manner
was
unusually
decisive
and
falkener
saw
that
it
was
time
to
make
things
smooth
oh
no
she
said
no
if
you
are
all
going
i
shall
go
too
only
home
is
so
delightful
i
hate
the
thought
of
leaving
it
it
has
seemed
very
delightful
to
me
for
the
past
few
minutes
answered
burton
but
i
glad
if
you
enjoyed
it
ah
burton
my
dear
you
take
these
things
too
seriously
replied
falkener
a
little
trouble
with
the
servants
an
everyday
occurrence
in
a
woman
life
you
of
the
stronger
sex
must
not
let
it
worry
you
so
much
when
you
kept
house
as
many
years
as
i
have
you
learn
that
the
great
thing
is
to
be
firm
from
the
beginning
that
the
only
criticism
i
could
make
of
you
burt
a
little
weak
a
little
weak
tucker
here
rose
pressing
his
hand
over
his
eyes
i
think
if
you
do
mind
i
wo
go
he
said
i
a
slight
headache
oh
nothing
much
but
i
lunch
quietly
here
if
you
let
me
a
slice
of
cold
meat
and
a
glass
of
sherry
is
all
i
shall
require
if
crane
were
weak
he
did
not
look
so
at
this
moment
i
am
sorry
solon
he
answered
but
it
would
be
very
much
more
convenient
if
you
went
with
us
he
had
no
intention
of
leaving
tucker
alone
in
the
house
with
while
smithfield
was
scouring
the
countryside
for
fresh
servants
i
not
thinking
so
much
of
myself
said
tucker
but
of
you
i
fear
i
should
not
be
much
of
an
addition
to
the
party
but
i
think
of
you
tuck
answered
his
host
what
in
the
world
would
there
be
for
you
to
do
at
home
except
talk
to
the
cook
tucker
said
rather
ungraciously
that
of
course
he
would
go
if
crane
wished
him
to
but
that
crane
however
did
not
allow
him
to
finish
his
sentence
thank
you
he
said
briskly
that
will
be
delightful
we
shall
be
starting
at
twelve
ix
eliot
large
library
to
which
crane
and
his
party
were
led
on
their
arrival
looked
as
only
a
room
can
look
which
has
been
occupied
for
several
hours
by
a
number
of
idle
men
all
the
sofa
cushions
were
on
the
floor
all
the
newspapers
were
on
the
sofas
cigarette
ashes
were
everywhere
and
the
air
was
heavy
with
a
combination
of
wood
and
tobacco
smoke
everybody
hair
was
ruffled
as
if
they
had
all
been
sitting
on
the
back
of
their
heads
and
eliot
himself
now
standing
commandingly
on
the
was
saying
yes
and
he
did
not
have
a
sound
leg
when
he
bought
him
and
that
must
have
been
in
for
i
remember
it
was
the
last
year
i
went
to
melton
he
broke
off
reluctantly
to
greet
his
guests
lefferts
who
looked
peculiarly
neat
and
fresh
among
his
companions
approached
burton
who
was
beside
falkener
they
have
been
talking
for
three
hours
he
observed
about
a
splint
on
the
nigh
foreleg
of
a
gray
horse
that
does
belong
to
any
of
them
sit
down
falkener
and
let
us
have
a
little
rational
conversation
does
that
idea
attract
you
not
particularly
since
you
ask
me
replied
falkener
not
deigning
even
to
look
at
the
poet
but
sweeping
her
head
about
slowly
as
if
scanning
vast
horizons
the
rational
does
attract
you
lefferts
went
on
cheerfully
well
then
we
must
try
something
else
how
about
the
or
the
or
even
better
the
but
falkener
uttering
a
slight
exclamation
of
impatience
moved
away
lefferts
turned
to
crane
with
his
unruffled
smile
she
does
like
me
he
said
cora
he
added
very
slightly
raising
his
voice
so
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
miss
falkener
who
immediately
approached
them
cora
why
is
it
your
mother
hates
me
so
much
she
certainly
does
returned
cora
frankly
you
know
leonard
you
are
really
rather
stupid
with
her
you
always
begin
by
saying
things
she
does
understand
and
of
course
no
one
likes
that
lefferts
sighed
you
see
she
stimulates
me
so
tremendously
one
gets
used
to
just
merely
boring
or
depressing
one
friends
but
to
be
actively
hated
is
exciting
people
who
have
lived
through
blood
feuds
and
tong
wars
tell
you
that
there
is
no
excitement
comparable
to
it
i
feel
a
little
like
the
leader
of
a
tong
whenever
i
meet
falkener
cora
would
you
belong
to
my
tong
or
would
you
feel
loyalty
demanded
your
remaining
in
your
mother
they
went
in
to
luncheon
before
cora
was
obliged
to
answer
and
here
lefferts
contrived
to
sit
next
to
her
by
the
comparatively
simple
expedient
of
making
the
man
who
had
already
seated
himself
at
her
side
get
up
and
yield
him
the
place
crane
sitting
between
his
host
and
another
man
enjoyed
a
period
of
quiet
without
his
exactly
arranging
it
a
definite
plan
for
the
afternoon
was
growing
up
in
his
mind
a
plan
which
it
must
be
confessed
had
been
first
suggested
by
tucker
idea
of
staying
at
home
a
plan
based
on
a
vision
of
and
willoughby
holding
the
kitchen
in
solitary
state
crane
knew
that
luncheons
at
eliot
were
long
ceremonies
food
was
served
and
eaten
slowly
you
sat
a
long
time
over
coffee
and
cigars
and
at
the
smallest
encouragement
eliot
would
bring
out
his
madeira
and
after
that
you
were
unusually
lucky
if
you
escaped
a
visit
to
the
stables
and
that
meant
the
whole
afternoon
so
he
awaited
a
good
opportunity
after
lunch
was
over
when
tucker
under
pretense
of
reading
a
newspaper
had
sunk
into
a
comfortable
doze
and
falkener
while
carrying
on
a
fairly
connected
conversation
with
eliot
was
really
concentrated
on
preventing
lefferts
from
taking
cora
into
another
room
this
was
crane
chance
he
slipped
into
the
hall
found
his
coat
and
hat
unearthed
his
chauffeur
and
motor
and
drove
quickly
home
sending
back
the
car
at
once
to
wait
for
the
others
he
did
not
as
his
impulse
was
go
in
the
kitchen
way
he
did
not
want
to
do
anything
that
might
annoy
at
the
same
time
he
rebelled
at
the
notion
of
having
always
to
offer
an
excuse
for
seeing
her
as
if
he
were
so
superior
a
being
that
he
had
to
explain
how
he
could
stoop
to
the
level
of
her
society
he
wanted
to
say
frankly
that
he
had
come
home
because
he
wanted
more
than
anything
in
the
world
to
see
her
again
the
first
thing
he
noticed
as
he
went
up
the
steps
of
the
piazza
was
willoughby
sleeping
in
the
warm
afternoon
sun
then
he
was
aware
of
the
sound
of
a
victrola
playing
dance
music
the
stood
wide
open
he
looked
in
smithfield
and
were
dancing
though
no
dancer
himself
crane
had
never
been
aware
of
any
prejudice
on
the
subject
indeed
he
had
sometimes
thought
that
those
who
protested
were
more
dangerously
suggestive
than
the
dances
themselves
but
now
he
felt
a
wave
of
protest
sweep
over
him
the
closeness
the
identity
of
intention
seemed
to
him
an
intolerable
form
of
intimacy
the
two
were
quite
unconscious
of
his
presence
and
he
stood
there
for
several
minutes
stood
there
indeed
until
hair
fell
down
and
she
had
to
stop
to
rearrange
it
she
looked
very
pretty
as
she
stood
panting
and
putting
it
up
again
but
she
exerted
no
attraction
upon
crane
disgust
he
thought
was
all
he
now
felt
one
did
not
after
all
as
he
told
himself
enter
into
competition
with
one
own
butler
he
went
quietly
away
ordered
a
horse
and
went
for
a
long
ride
a
man
not
very
easily
moved
emotionally
he
had
never
experienced
the
sensation
of
jealousy
and
he
now
supposed
himself
to
have
reached
as
calm
a
judgment
as
any
in
his
life
everything
he
had
ever
heard
to
discredit
every
intimation
of
tucker
every
sneer
of
falkener
came
back
to
him
now
he
would
like
to
have
sent
for
her
and
in
the
most
scathing
terms
told
her
what
he
thought
of
her
an
interview
which
he
imagined
as
very
different
from
his
former
reproof
but
he
decided
it
would
be
simpler
and
more
dignified
never
to
notice
her
in
any
way
again
on
this
decision
he
at
last
turned
his
head
homeward
smithfield
let
him
in
as
calm
and
imperturbable
as
ever
your
afternoon
been
satisfactory
smithfield
inquired
his
employer
smithfield
stared
i
beg
pardon
sir
have
you
succeeded
in
finding
a
boy
to
replace
brindlebury
the
butler
face
cleared
oh
yes
i
believe
i
have
not
a
boy
exactly
quite
an
elderly
man
but
one
who
promises
to
do
sir
good
crane
turned
away
but
the
man
followed
him
miss
falkener
asked
me
to
tell
you
when
you
came
in
sir
that
she
would
be
glad
of
a
word
with
you
she
in
your
office
crane
stood
absolutely
still
for
a
second
or
two
and
as
he
stood
his
jaw
slowly
set
as
he
took
a
resolution
then
he
opened
the
door
of
his
office
and
went
in
two
personalities
sometimes
advance
to
a
meeting
with
intentions
as
opposite
as
those
of
two
trains
on
a
single
track
crane
and
cora
were
both
too
much
absorbed
in
their
own
aims
to
observe
the
signals
of
the
other
cora
began
crane
with
all
the
solemnity
of
which
the
two
syllables
were
capable
oh
burton
cried
the
girl
why
did
you
leave
eliot
like
that
it
has
worried
me
so
much
did
anything
happen
to
annoy
you
what
was
it
i
sent
the
car
right
back
for
you
it
was
the
car
i
wanted
crane
began
at
once
to
feel
guilty
the
form
of
egotism
hardest
to
eradicate
from
the
human
heart
i
sorry
if
i
seemed
rude
my
dear
cora
i
thought
you
were
settled
and
content
with
lefferts
i
did
not
suppose
any
one
would
notice
your
absence
oh
burt
he
became
aware
of
a
suppressed
excitement
an
imminent
outburst
of
some
sort
a
sudden
terror
swept
over
him
terror
of
the
future
of
the
deed
he
was
about
to
do
terror
even
of
this
strange
and
utterly
unknown
woman
whom
he
was
about
to
make
a
part
of
his
daily
life
as
long
as
days
existed
for
a
second
he
had
an
illusion
that
he
had
never
seen
never
spoken
to
her
before
and
as
he
struggled
against
this
queer
abnormality
he
heard
that
in
set
clear
and
not
terms
he
was
asking
her
to
marry
him
she
clasped
her
hands
together
oh
it
just
what
i
was
trying
to
prevent
to
prevent
burt
i
treated
you
so
badly
he
looked
at
her
without
expression
well
let
get
the
facts
before
we
decide
on
that
the
facts
cora
intimated
were
terrible
she
was
already
engaged
to
lefferts
she
nodded
tragically
crane
felt
a
strong
inclination
to
laugh
the
world
took
on
a
new
aspect
reality
returned
with
a
rush
and
with
it
a
strong
friendly
affection
for
cora
he
hardly
heard
her
long
and
passionate
she
knew
she
said
that
she
had
given
him
every
encouragement
well
the
truth
was
she
had
simply
made
up
her
mind
to
marry
him
nothing
would
have
pleased
her
mother
more
but
she
did
not
intend
to
shelter
herself
behind
obedience
to
her
mother
she
had
intended
to
do
it
for
her
own
ends
that
was
what
i
tried
to
tell
you
last
evening
in
the
garden
burt
i
deliberately
schemed
to
marry
you
but
you
must
think
i
did
not
like
and
admire
you
in
a
way
there
only
one
way
cora
this
sent
her
off
again
into
the
depths
of
she
had
no
excuse
to
offer
she
kept
protesting
and
offered
a
dozen
the
most
potent
being
her
uncertainty
of
crane
own
feelings
for
her
you
behaved
so
strangely
for
a
man
in
love
burt
she
wailed
i
was
never
sure
in
the
sense
you
mean
i
was
not
in
love
with
you
cora
and
yet
you
want
to
marry
me
in
your
own
words
i
liked
and
admired
you
but
i
was
not
in
love
the
humiliating
truth
is
my
dear
girl
that
i
was
so
fatuous
as
to
believe
that
you
were
fond
of
me
there
was
a
short
silence
and
then
cora
exclaimed
candidly
are
people
queer
here
i
have
been
worrying
myself
sick
over
my
treatment
of
you
and
now
that
i
find
you
are
not
made
unhappy
by
it
do
you
know
what
i
feel
disappointed
disappointed
somehow
that
you
love
me
crane
laughed
i
also
he
said
have
been
slightly
oppressed
by
the
responsibility
of
your
fancied
affection
and
i
too
am
conscious
of
a
certain
flatness
in
facing
the
truth
cora
hardly
listened
it
seems
so
queer
you
do
love
me
she
murmured
why
do
you
love
me
burt
at
this
they
both
laughed
and
went
on
presently
to
the
more
detailed
consideration
of
cora
affairs
she
and
lefferts
had
met
the
winter
before
she
had
not
liked
him
at
first
prejudiced
perhaps
by
the
fact
that
he
was
a
poet
and
that
he
pretended
to
dislike
all
the
things
she
cared
for
but
she
had
found
almost
at
once
that
he
understood
more
about
the
things
he
hated
than
most
men
did
about
their
favorite
topics
he
really
wonderful
burt
she
said
he
understands
everything
every
one
do
you
know
he
told
me
yesterday
that
i
need
worry
about
you
that
you
were
in
love
with
me
only
i
did
not
believe
him
he
said
confuses
you
my
dear
is
that
crane
is
undoubtedly
in
love
one
sees
that
clearly
enough
but
not
with
you
he
did
not
just
hit
it
there
though
answered
crane
in
a
rather
feeble
tone
cora
however
was
in
a
condition
of
mind
in
which
it
was
not
difficult
to
distract
her
and
she
continued
without
paying
any
further
attention
to
the
example
of
lefferts
extraordinary
insight
she
went
on
to
say
that
she
had
had
no
idea
that
she
was
in
love
until
one
day
when
she
found
herself
speaking
of
it
as
if
it
had
always
been
crane
asked
about
lefferts
worldly
prospects
which
turned
out
to
be
extremely
dark
had
he
a
profession
yes
such
a
strange
one
for
a
poet
he
was
an
expert
statistician
but
cora
sighed
there
did
not
seem
to
be
a
very
large
demand
for
his
abilities
among
the
many
minor
responsibilities
inherited
from
his
father
crane
remembered
a
statistical
publication
he
immediately
offered
its
editorship
to
lefferts
cora
answer
was
to
fling
her
arms
about
his
neck
oh
burt
she
said
you
really
are
an
angel
it
was
crane
idea
of
what
would
have
happened
if
falkener
had
entered
at
this
moment
which
she
did
not
that
made
him
ask
how
matters
stood
in
regard
to
her
she
does
know
answered
cora
and
i
do
think
she
even
suspects
and
i
such
a
coward
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
to
tell
her
every
time
i
see
leonard
he
asks
me
if
i
have
and
now
he
is
threatening
to
do
it
himself
and
that
you
know
burt
would
be
fatal
cora
said
crane
i
am
about
to
prove
that
i
am
no
fair
weather
friend
with
your
permission
i
will
tell
your
mother
no
permission
was
ever
more
easily
secured
it
was
now
five
an
hour
when
the
elder
lady
became
restless
if
not
served
with
a
little
tea
and
attention
crane
rang
and
ordered
tea
for
two
served
in
the
office
and
then
sent
smithfield
to
ask
falkener
if
he
might
have
a
word
with
her
she
and
her
daughter
passed
each
other
on
the
threshold
how
cozy
this
is
she
began
as
she
seated
herself
by
the
fire
smithfield
keeps
the
silver
bright
but
i
afraid
he
has
no
judgment
have
you
seen
the
man
he
has
engaged
instead
of
that
dreadful
boy
why
he
so
old
and
lame
he
can
hardly
get
up
and
down
stairs
he
never
do
burton
take
my
word
for
that
i
have
something
more
serious
to
say
to
you
than
the
discussion
of
domestic
matters
falkener
said
crane
and
for
one
of
the
few
times
in
her
life
falkener
forgot
that
the
house
contained
such
a
thing
as
servants
a
more
important
idea
took
possession
of
her
attention
burton
began
to
speak
about
romance
he
said
he
did
not
know
exactly
how
an
older
generation
than
his
looked
at
such
questions
for
his
own
part
he
regarded
himself
in
many
ways
as
a
practical
and
man
and
yet
more
and
more
he
found
himself
gravitating
to
the
belief
that
romance
love
the
drawing
together
for
mutual
strength
and
happiness
of
two
individuals
was
the
only
basis
for
individual
life
people
talked
of
the
modern
taste
for
luxury
to
his
mind
there
was
no
luxury
like
a
congenial
companion
no
hardship
like
having
to
go
through
life
without
it
love
did
falkener
believe
in
love
do
i
believe
in
love
my
dear
burt
she
cried
what
else
is
there
to
believe
in
no
girl
no
nice
girl
ever
marries
for
any
other
reason
oh
they
try
sometimes
to
be
mercenary
but
they
do
succeed
i
could
never
forgive
a
woman
for
considering
anything
else
i
thought
you
would
feel
like
that
said
crane
i
thought
cora
was
wrong
in
thinking
you
would
oppose
her
for
prudent
or
not
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
there
is
no
doubt
that
she
and
lefferts
are
in
love
the
blow
was
a
cruel
one
and
perhaps
cruelly
administered
falkener
even
in
the
first
instant
of
disaster
saw
and
took
the
only
way
out
love
yes
but
this
was
not
love
this
was
a
mere
infatuation
on
one
side
and
a
dark
and
wicked
plot
on
the
other
she
would
never
forgive
burton
never
for
being
a
party
to
this
scheme
to
throw
her
daughter
her
dear
cora
into
the
arms
of
this
adventurer
burton
who
had
always
professed
such
friendship
for
her
she
would
not
stay
another
moment
in
his
house
there
was
a
train
to
the
north
and
she
and
her
misguided
daughter
would
take
it
crane
began
to
see
why
cora
for
all
her
physical
courage
dreaded
a
disagreement
with
her
mother
he
himself
felt
as
if
an
avalanche
had
passed
over
him
leaving
him
alive
but
dazed
falkener
sat
with
her
handkerchief
pressed
to
her
eyes
not
so
much
to
wipe
away
her
tears
for
she
was
not
crying
but
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
her
perfidious
young
host
be
so
kind
she
directed
from
behind
this
veil
as
to
give
orders
for
the
packing
of
my
trunks
and
let
cora
know
that
we
are
leaving
immediately
burton
hesitated
i
am
afraid
since
the
housemaid
has
left
there
is
any
one
to
pack
for
you
falkener
he
said
wo
you
delay
your
going
until
i
ca
bear
to
have
you
leave
me
like
this
falkener
shook
her
head
call
solon
she
said
no
do
ask
me
to
stay
and
why
pray
the
cook
make
herself
useful
for
once
falkener
was
not
of
course
in
a
position
to
know
that
crane
would
not
at
the
moment
stoop
to
ask
any
favor
of
he
was
glad
of
an
excuse
to
escape
however
and
summon
solon
to
take
his
place
he
found
smithfield
in
the
hall
and
explained
to
him
that
the
ladies
were
called
suddenly
away
and
then
he
himself
walked
down
to
the
garage
to
arrange
for
their
departure
when
he
came
back
he
found
the
house
in
the
sort
of
turmoil
that
only
a
thoroughly
executive
woman
in
a
bad
temper
can
create
smithfield
cora
and
seemed
to
be
all
together
engaged
in
packing
solon
and
the
new
man
were
running
up
and
down
stairs
with
forgotten
books
and
coats
and
umbrellas
while
falkener
was
exercising
a
general
and
unflattering
supervision
of
every
one
activities
to
say
the
new
man
was
running
is
inaccurate
even
tucker
dignified
celerity
hardly
deserves
such
a
word
but
the
new
man
crippled
and
bent
as
he
was
attained
only
such
velocity
as
was
consistent
with
a
perfectly
stiff
left
leg
crane
really
felt
he
ought
to
interfere
on
his
behalf
when
he
saw
him
laboring
downstairs
with
heavy
bags
and
bundles
he
probably
would
have
done
so
had
not
his
mind
been
distracted
by
coming
unexpectedly
upon
a
little
scene
in
the
upper
hall
cora
was
trying
to
press
a
fee
into
the
hand
of
and
was
refusing
it
both
were
flushed
and
embarrassed
i
wanted
to
give
you
this
because
oh
i
could
really
i
not
done
any
oh
you
been
such
a
oh
no
miss
i
not
done
the
approach
of
crane
enabled
the
cook
to
escape
cora
turned
to
burton
she
worked
so
hard
and
she
would
take
a
tip
she
said
and
you
never
felt
anything
like
her
little
hands
burt
it
like
touching
a
bird
yes
i
know
said
crane
i
mean
they
look
so
i
want
just
a
word
with
you
cora
he
continued
rather
rapidly
i
afraid
i
done
you
much
good
except
that
your
mother
is
angrier
with
me
than
she
is
with
you
and
that
something
oh
i
do
care
now
it
over
she
answered
and
you
tell
len
this
evening
all
that
happened
and
where
to
write
to
me
and
we
shall
both
be
grateful
to
you
as
long
as
we
live
at
this
moment
falkener
in
hat
veil
and
wrap
swept
out
of
her
room
followed
by
smithfield
tucker
and
the
old
man
carrying
the
last
of
her
possessions
the
moment
of
departure
had
come
x
after
the
departure
of
the
ladies
tucker
and
crane
stood
an
instant
in
silence
on
the
piazza
solon
who
had
been
waked
from
his
customary
afternoon
nap
by
the
frantic
summons
of
falkener
was
still
a
little
confused
as
to
all
that
had
happened
and
had
gathered
nothing
clearly
except
that
burton
was
in
some
way
very
much
to
be
blamed
it
too
bad
he
observed
to
have
them
go
off
like
that
we
shall
miss
them
i
fear
crane
was
standing
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
watching
the
as
it
disappeared
down
the
drive
let
us
avoid
that
tuck
by
going
away
ourselves
you
mean
to
leave
here
why
not
the
experiment
has
not
struck
me
as
a
very
happy
one
our
servants
have
gone
our
guests
have
left
us
and
for
my
part
i
am
eager
to
be
off
as
well
the
time
had
come
then
when
was
to
be
friendless
and
out
of
a
job
the
third
act
was
here
anything
that
suits
you
pleases
me
burton
said
tucker
in
that
case
answered
crane
i
will
telephone
reed
to
come
over
at
once
and
make
arrangements
for
giving
up
the
house
we
ca
i
suppose
catch
that
night
train
but
with
luck
we
may
get
away
morning
you
seem
in
a
great
hurry
i
like
never
to
see
the
place
again
returned
burton
in
the
moment
of
silence
that
followed
this
heartfelt
exclamation
a
figure
came
briskly
around
the
corner
of
the
piazza
a
figure
discernible
in
the
light
shed
by
the
front
door
oh
come
here
said
crane
the
figure
betrayed
no
sign
of
having
heard
unless
a
slight
accentuation
in
its
limp
might
be
so
interpreted
what
your
name
shouted
burton
the
old
man
looked
up
yes
yes
he
said
in
a
high
shaking
voice
i
lame
you
right
there
sir
i
been
lame
these
twenty
years
and
carrying
down
all
them
trunks
has
put
sich
a
crick
in
my
back
as
never
was
i
asked
you
your
name
repeated
his
employer
when
i
came
why
this
afternoon
sir
it
was
your
butler
engaged
me
i
worked
at
the
hotel
here
once
and
smithfield
he
come
to
my
wife
and
says
he
says
he
knowing
her
since
he
was
a
little
boy
let
me
look
at
you
said
crane
sternly
but
the
elderly
man
still
talking
to
himself
retreated
into
the
shadow
and
then
tucker
was
surprised
to
hear
his
host
exclaim
with
violence
by
jove
the
young
devil
and
to
see
him
hurl
himself
off
the
piazza
at
its
highest
point
he
would
have
landed
actually
on
top
of
his
decrepit
servitor
had
not
the
old
man
developed
an
activity
utterly
unsuspected
by
tucker
which
enabled
him
to
get
away
down
the
avenue
with
a
speed
that
crane
could
not
surpass
well
well
what
are
we
coming
to
tucker
murmured
as
he
watched
them
dodge
and
double
around
trees
and
bushes
presently
they
passed
out
of
the
light
from
the
house
and
only
the
sound
of
their
feet
beating
on
the
hard
avenue
indicated
that
the
fugitive
had
taken
to
the
open
solon
was
still
peering
nervously
into
the
dark
when
at
last
his
host
returned
crane
was
breathing
hard
and
held
in
his
hand
a
small
furry
object
that
tucker
made
out
gradually
to
be
a
neat
gray
wig
oh
said
burton
still
panting
and
slapping
his
side
i
have
run
so
hard
since
i
was
in
college
but
i
should
have
got
him
if
it
been
for
his
superior
knowledge
of
the
ground
my
dear
burton
said
tucker
crossly
what
in
the
world
have
you
been
doing
what
have
i
been
doing
i
been
trying
to
catch
that
wretched
boy
brindlebury
but
it
as
well
i
did
i
dare
say
i
thought
his
limp
a
little
spectacular
this
afternoon
when
the
trunks
were
being
carried
down
but
his
deafness
the
young
fool
that
deafness
never
found
anywhere
but
on
the
comic
stage
was
too
much
for
me
he
runs
fast
say
that
for
him
he
led
me
through
a
bramble
hedge
backed
through
himself
that
when
i
got
his
wig
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
we
all
were
murdered
in
our
beds
said
tucker
that
right
tuck
said
crane
look
on
the
cheerful
side
come
with
me
now
while
i
speak
to
smithfield
i
want
to
know
what
he
has
to
say
for
himself
smithfield
looking
particularly
elegant
in
his
shirt
sleeves
a
costume
which
shows
off
a
slim
figure
to
great
advantage
was
rather
languidly
setting
the
for
two
that
is
to
say
he
was
rubbing
a
shaped
like
a
miniature
new
england
to
remove
the
faint
imprint
of
his
own
fingers
smithfield
said
crane
briskly
i
afraid
your
new
useful
man
going
to
be
very
useful
he
seems
to
me
too
old
smithfield
placed
the
glass
deliberately
upon
the
table
he
not
so
old
as
he
appears
sir
he
answered
only
his
next
birthday
a
married
man
no
sir
a
widower
of
many
years
his
wife
died
when
her
first
baby
was
born
that
present
chauffeur
that
how
i
happened
to
get
the
old
fellow
and
when
the
rheumatism
smithfield
said
crane
that
about
enough
put
down
that
glass
put
on
your
coat
and
hat
and
get
out
you
lying
to
me
and
you
been
lying
to
me
from
the
beginning
do
stay
to
pack
your
things
you
can
settle
all
that
with
reed
get
out
of
my
house
and
let
me
see
you
again
and
he
added
throwing
the
gray
wig
into
his
hands
there
a
souvenir
for
you
smithfield
without
the
least
change
of
expression
caught
the
wig
bowed
and
withdrew
and
now
tuck
crane
added
turning
to
his
lawyer
i
wish
you
would
go
and
telephone
reed
to
come
here
at
once
and
clear
this
whole
thing
up
tell
him
i
send
the
motor
for
him
as
soon
as
it
comes
back
it
now
observed
tucker
ask
him
to
dinner
then
said
crane
i
must
go
and
see
that
smithfield
really
gets
out
of
this
house
illustration
from
the
the
dinner
olivia
lefferts
tucker
weeks
and
crane
both
tasks
had
been
accomplished
when
at
about
eight
tucker
and
crane
again
met
in
the
hall
smithfield
had
been
actually
seen
off
the
place
tucker
had
telephoned
reed
and
despatched
the
motor
for
him
and
now
the
sound
of
an
approaching
car
was
heard
that
ca
be
reed
yet
said
tucker
there
has
been
time
crane
shook
his
head
it
is
the
sound
of
my
engine
either
he
answered
headlights
came
sweeping
up
the
drive
and
a
few
minutes
later
lefferts
in
full
evening
dress
entered
the
house
i
afraid
i
a
little
bit
late
he
said
but
i
missed
a
turn
for
an
instant
crane
regarded
him
blankly
then
he
remembered
that
once
ages
before
or
perhaps
no
earlier
than
that
very
afternoon
he
had
invited
lefferts
to
dinner
and
at
the
same
time
he
realized
what
had
not
heretofore
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
to
serve
dinner
except
who
had
in
all
probability
cooked
dinner
for
only
two
reed
might
be
there
at
any
minute
it
was
really
necessary
in
so
acute
a
domestic
crisis
to
put
pride
in
his
pocket
and
go
downstairs
and
speak
to
his
cook
he
put
his
hand
on
lefferts
shoulder
awfully
sorry
my
dear
fellow
he
said
that
things
are
not
quite
as
anticipated
tucker
will
tell
you
we
have
had
rather
a
stormy
afternoon
give
him
a
cigarette
and
a
cocktail
tuck
and
i
be
back
in
a
minute
he
disappeared
down
the
kitchen
stairs
with
what
different
feelings
he
said
to
himself
did
he
now
descend
those
stairs
but
when
he
was
actually
in
the
kitchen
when
willoughby
was
once
again
bounding
forward
to
greet
him
and
was
allowing
herself
that
slow
curved
smile
of
hers
he
was
surprised
and
disappointed
to
find
that
his
feelings
were
after
all
much
the
same
as
before
over
his
manner
however
he
was
still
master
and
that
was
cold
and
formal
in
the
extreme
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
he
began
but
she
interrupted
this
time
she
said
gaily
i
know
what
it
is
that
you
are
going
to
scold
about
i
am
not
going
to
scold
she
laughed
well
that
a
wonder
and
glancing
at
him
she
was
astonished
to
find
no
answering
smile
are
you
really
angry
at
me
she
asked
on
account
of
this
afternoon
this
afternoon
on
account
of
that
silly
plan
about
brindlebury
i
did
not
know
they
were
going
to
do
it
and
when
it
was
done
i
could
betray
them
could
i
crane
made
a
gesture
that
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
really
had
no
means
of
judging
what
his
cook
might
or
might
not
do
you
believe
me
do
you
believe
you
said
crane
i
have
considered
the
question
one
way
or
the
other
why
crane
said
whatever
has
come
over
you
that
you
should
speak
like
that
this
has
come
over
me
answered
crane
that
i
came
down
here
in
a
hurry
to
give
some
orders
and
not
to
discuss
the
question
of
veracity
the
figure
of
stiffened
she
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
back
and
what
are
your
orders
she
said
in
a
tone
of
direful
monotony
crane
as
has
been
stated
was
no
coward
and
even
if
he
had
been
anger
would
have
lent
him
courage
there
are
two
gentlemen
coming
to
dine
four
in
all
and
as
he
saw
slightly
beck
her
head
at
this
he
added
recklessly
as
smithfield
is
gone
you
will
have
to
serve
dinner
as
well
as
cook
it
no
replied
the
cook
no
indeed
certainly
not
i
was
engaged
to
cook
and
i
will
cook
to
the
very
best
of
my
abilities
but
i
was
not
engaged
to
be
a
maid
of
all
work
you
were
engaged
to
do
as
you
told
there
you
are
mistaken
you
will
serve
dinner
crane
i
will
not
the
problem
of
the
irresistible
force
and
the
immovable
body
seemed
about
to
be
demonstrated
they
looked
each
other
steadily
and
hostilely
in
the
eyes
we
seem
said
crane
to
be
dealing
with
the
eternal
problem
between
employer
and
employee
you
not
lazy
the
work
before
you
is
nothing
but
you
deliberately
choose
to
stand
on
your
rights
on
a
purely
technical
point
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
what
are
you
doing
then
i
making
myself
just
as
disagreeable
as
i
can
answered
of
course
i
should
have
been
delighted
to
do
anything
for
any
one
who
asked
me
politely
but
when
a
man
comes
into
my
kitchen
and
talks
about
giving
orders
and
my
doing
as
i
told
and
serving
dinner
why
my
answer
is
he
ought
to
have
thought
of
his
extra
guests
before
he
dismissed
my
brothers
your
brothers
cried
crane
do
you
mean
to
say
that
smithfield
is
your
brother
too
well
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
said
the
cook
crossly
but
it
happens
to
be
true
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
irresistible
force
the
problem
was
now
completely
resolved
o
he
cried
why
in
the
world
did
you
tell
me
so
before
i
ca
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
things
it
has
everything
he
answered
it
makes
me
see
how
wrong
i
have
been
how
rude
it
makes
me
want
to
apologize
for
everything
i
have
said
since
i
came
into
the
kitchen
it
makes
me
ask
you
most
humbly
if
you
wo
help
me
out
in
the
ridiculous
situation
in
which
i
find
myself
but
i
do
see
why
smithfield
being
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
explain
answered
burton
although
i
assure
you
it
can
and
shall
be
done
perhaps
this
evening
after
these
tiresome
men
have
gone
you
will
give
me
a
few
minutes
in
the
meantime
just
let
me
say
that
i
was
angry
at
you
however
wrongly
when
i
came
down
i
not
sure
but
that
i
still
angry
at
said
the
cook
but
she
smiled
as
she
said
it
you
have
every
right
to
be
and
no
reason
he
returned
and
you
are
going
to
be
an
angel
and
serve
dinner
are
you
i
said
i
would
if
asked
politely
though
how
in
the
world
i
shall
sit
still
and
let
you
wait
on
me
i
do
see
oh
said
if
you
never
have
anything
harder
to
do
than
that
you
are
very
different
from
most
of
your
sex
and
now
she
added
i
better
run
upstairs
and
put
two
more
places
at
the
table
for
already
if
i
come
back
later
in
the
evening
you
wo
turn
me
out
of
the
kitchen
she
was
already
on
her
way
upstairs
but
she
turned
with
a
smile
it
your
kitchen
sir
she
said
crane
followed
her
slowly
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
must
have
a
talk
with
lefferts
he
found
him
and
tucker
making
rather
heavy
weather
of
conversation
in
the
tucker
had
naturally
enough
determined
to
adopt
falkener
views
of
lefferts
he
had
conformed
with
crane
request
and
given
the
poet
a
cigarette
and
a
cocktail
but
he
had
attempted
no
explanation
beyond
an
unsatisfactory
statement
that
the
ladies
had
been
called
away
unexpectedly
nothing
serious
i
hope
lefferts
had
said
i
hope
not
tucker
had
returned
and
not
another
word
would
he
utter
on
the
subject
lefferts
was
therefore
glad
to
respond
to
crane
invitation
to
come
into
the
office
for
a
few
minutes
and
leave
tucker
to
the
contemplation
of
his
own
loyalty
left
alone
tucker
eager
ears
soon
detected
the
sound
of
dishes
in
the
and
he
knew
that
this
could
be
produced
by
the
hand
of
no
other
than
the
moment
seemed
to
have
been
especially
designed
for
his
purpose
and
he
decided
to
take
advantage
of
it
was
setting
the
table
with
far
more
energy
than
smithfield
had
displayed
in
fact
her
task
was
almost
finished
when
tucker
entered
and
advancing
to
the
mantelpiece
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
shelf
and
smiled
down
upon
her
benevolently
the
time
has
come
sooner
than
we
anticipated
when
i
can
be
of
assistance
to
you
he
said
yes
indeed
sir
she
returned
with
a
promptness
that
fifteen
years
before
would
have
made
his
heart
beat
faster
thank
you
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
the
sir
she
interrupted
flicking
a
napkin
in
their
direction
they
ought
to
be
filled
not
too
full
sir
that
quite
enough
it
is
a
tub
you
know
and
now
if
you
a
match
about
you
and
gentlemen
always
have
matches
i
believe
would
you
light
the
candles
and
then
yes
i
do
think
we
about
ready
now
tucker
who
could
not
very
well
refuse
such
trivial
services
when
he
was
offering
one
much
more
momentous
poured
a
little
water
from
the
ice
pitcher
into
the
glass
but
he
did
it
with
such
dignity
and
from
such
a
height
that
he
spilled
much
of
it
over
the
doilies
the
cook
did
not
reprove
him
directly
but
she
changed
the
doily
with
a
manner
that
seemed
to
suggest
that
another
time
she
would
do
the
job
herself
and
when
tucker
took
a
neat
gold
from
his
pocket
and
prepared
to
light
the
candles
she
coolly
took
the
whole
thing
out
of
his
hands
remarking
that
he
might
set
the
shades
on
fire
and
then
they
be
in
what
she
described
as
a
nice
way
observing
that
she
was
about
to
leave
the
room
he
put
himself
before
the
door
i
want
just
a
word
no
time
now
sir
perhaps
morning
will
be
too
late
you
must
know
this
evening
i
do
want
to
say
a
word
against
crane
young
men
who
have
always
had
everything
they
want
are
naturally
thoughtless
but
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
turned
out
at
a
moment
notice
turned
out
yes
crane
is
going
either
or
morning
did
he
tell
you
he
had
her
attention
now
she
looked
at
him
intently
crane
going
i
thought
he
had
the
house
for
six
weeks
so
he
had
but
he
bored
with
it
miss
falkener
has
gone
and
he
sees
no
reason
for
staying
on
he
be
off
either
at
midnight
or
in
the
morning
you
about
to
lose
your
place
she
stood
staring
before
her
so
blankly
that
it
grieved
him
to
see
her
so
deeply
concerned
about
the
loss
of
her
position
and
he
pressed
on
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
your
comfort
being
dependent
on
the
caprices
of
crane
or
any
one
come
to
me
this
is
no
life
for
you
with
your
youth
and
beauty
and
charm
i
could
offer
you
a
position
that
you
need
never
leave
never
unless
you
wanted
to
please
move
from
the
door
sir
not
until
you
heard
me
and
he
moved
toward
her
as
if
to
take
her
in
his
arms
at
some
previous
period
of
time
the
revellys
presided
over
by
a
less
elegant
functionary
than
smithfield
must
have
been
in
the
habit
of
summoning
the
family
to
meals
by
means
of
a
large
japanese
gong
that
now
stood
neglected
in
a
corner
to
this
sprang
and
beat
it
with
a
vigor
that
made
the
house
resound
the
next
instant
crane
burst
into
the
room
what
the
matter
he
exclaimed
and
added
fixing
his
eyes
on
his
lawyer
what
the
deuce
are
you
doing
here
tuck
i
said
tucker
was
giving
what
help
i
could
in
setting
the
table
like
hell
you
were
do
you
mean
you
doubt
what
i
say
you
bet
i
do
and
may
i
ask
what
you
do
think
i
was
doing
asked
tucker
i
think
you
were
making
love
to
the
cook
gentlemen
gentlemen
murmured
the
cook
wo
you
please
let
me
go
down
and
attend
to
the
dinner
the
chicken
will
be
terribly
overdone
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
the
request
well
said
tucker
i
certainly
would
turn
a
poor
girl
out
at
a
few
hours
notice
as
you
mean
to
do
who
says
i
mean
to
you
told
me
yourself
you
meant
to
leave
and
what
kind
of
a
job
were
you
offering
her
i
tell
you
i
was
trying
to
help
her
and
is
that
why
she
rang
the
gong
she
rang
presumably
because
dinner
was
ready
there
another
presumption
that
seems
to
me
more
probable
burton
i
shall
not
spend
another
night
under
your
roof
i
had
reached
the
same
conclusion
tucker
turned
with
great
dignity
the
trouble
is
he
said
that
you
have
not
the
faintest
idea
of
the
conduct
of
a
gentleman
and
with
this
he
walked
slowly
from
the
room
the
cook
did
not
now
seem
so
eager
to
get
back
to
the
kitchen
she
stood
twisting
a
napkin
in
her
hands
and
looking
at
the
floor
not
unaware
however
that
her
employer
was
looking
at
her
the
trouble
really
is
he
said
gently
that
you
are
too
intolerably
lovely
oh
sir
sir
oh
sir
you
say
that
as
if
every
man
you
knew
had
not
been
saying
the
same
thing
to
you
for
the
last
five
years
had
another
of
her
attacks
of
dangerous
candor
well
a
good
many
have
said
it
sir
she
whispered
but
it
never
sounded
to
me
as
it
did
when
you
said
it
and
after
this
she
had
the
grace
to
dart
through
the
door
and
downstairs
so
fast
that
he
could
hear
her
little
heels
clatter
on
each
step
as
she
went
in
the
hall
he
found
tucker
standing
under
a
lamp
studying
a
with
glasses
set
very
far
down
his
nose
opposite
lefferts
was
leaning
against
the
wall
his
arms
folded
and
the
expression
on
his
face
of
one
who
has
happened
unexpectedly
upon
a
very
good
moving
picture
show
seeing
crane
tucker
folded
up
his
and
removed
his
glasses
your
other
guest
has
just
arrived
he
observed
oh
is
reed
here
yes
said
lefferts
he
in
your
office
taking
off
his
coat
and
you
may
be
interested
to
know
added
tucker
with
a
biting
simplicity
that
had
impressed
many
juries
in
its
time
you
may
be
interested
to
know
that
he
is
the
man
i
found
kissing
last
week
what
reed
cried
crane
with
a
gesture
that
might
have
been
interpreted
as
ferocious
hearing
his
name
called
reed
came
hurrying
out
yes
he
said
advancing
with
outstretched
hand
here
i
am
sorry
to
be
late
but
i
was
ready
before
we
go
in
to
dinner
said
crane
shortly
tucker
and
reed
moved
first
toward
the
lefferts
drew
his
host
aside
just
one
moment
he
said
you
went
off
so
quickly
when
that
gong
rang
that
i
did
not
have
any
chance
to
tell
you
how
i
feel
about
your
generosity
it
makes
crane
grasped
his
hand
you
have
an
opportunity
this
very
moment
he
replied
to
repay
me
for
anything
i
ever
have
done
or
may
do
for
you
talk
my
dear
fellow
talk
at
dinner
do
nothing
but
talk
otherwise
i
shall
knock
those
two
heads
together
lefferts
smiled
i
doubt
if
you
get
much
sense
into
them
even
if
you
did
he
murmured
no
answered
burton
but
i
should
have
a
great
deal
of
enjoyment
in
doing
it
xi
they
sat
down
at
table
and
as
crane
looked
at
his
guests
he
had
little
hope
that
even
lefferts
cheerful
facility
could
save
the
situation
circumstances
would
be
too
much
against
him
even
the
poet
himself
could
hardly
be
at
his
best
having
just
arrived
in
the
hope
of
dining
with
his
to
find
she
had
been
spirited
away
by
an
irate
mother
this
in
itself
was
enough
to
put
a
pall
on
most
men
yet
of
the
three
guests
lefferts
seemed
by
far
the
most
hopeful
tucker
was
already
sullen
and
getting
more
sullen
every
moment
crane
knew
the
signs
of
his
lawyer
bearing
the
irritable
eye
that
would
meet
no
one
directly
the
tapping
fingers
the
lips
compressed
but
moving
tucker
was
one
of
those
people
cursed
by
anger
after
the
event
his
nature
slow
moving
or
overcontrolled
bore
him
past
the
real
moment
of
offense
without
explosion
but
with
the
crisis
over
his
resentment
began
to
gain
in
strength
and
to
grow
more
bitter
as
the
opportunity
for
action
receded
more
and
more
into
the
past
crane
knew
now
that
tucker
was
reviewing
every
phrase
that
had
passed
between
them
every
injury
real
or
fancied
that
he
had
ever
received
at
crane
hands
these
he
was
summoning
like
a
sort
of
phantom
army
to
fight
on
his
side
no
tucker
was
not
a
guest
from
whom
any
host
could
expect
much
genial
interchange
that
evening
reed
on
the
other
hand
was
too
unconscious
placid
confident
in
his
own
powers
to
arrange
any
little
domestic
difficulties
that
might
have
arisen
he
sat
down
unfolded
his
napkin
and
turned
to
lefferts
in
answer
to
the
inquiry
about
real
estate
which
lefferts
had
just
tactfully
addressed
to
him
the
great
charm
of
this
section
of
the
country
he
was
saying
is
that
from
the
time
of
its
earliest
settlement
it
has
been
in
the
hands
of
a
small
group
of
at
this
instant
entered
with
the
soup
reed
who
had
expected
to
see
smithfield
stopped
short
and
stared
at
her
with
an
astonishment
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
disguise
lefferts
following
the
direction
of
his
eyes
and
seeing
for
the
first
time
mistook
the
subject
of
reed
surprise
oh
he
said
as
the
girl
left
the
room
is
this
face
that
launched
a
thousand
ships
tucker
who
was
perhaps
not
as
familiar
with
the
elizabethan
dramatists
as
he
should
have
been
replied
shortly
that
this
was
the
cook
a
very
beautiful
little
person
said
lefferts
imagining
poor
fellow
that
he
was
now
on
safe
ground
i
own
said
tucker
that
i
have
never
been
able
to
take
much
interest
in
the
personal
appearance
of
servants
you
sometimes
behave
as
if
you
did
tuck
remarked
his
host
if
you
are
interested
in
beauty
observed
lefferts
i
do
see
how
you
can
eliminate
any
of
its
manifestations
particularly
according
to
social
classes
such
a
preoccupation
with
beauty
strikes
me
as
decadent
answered
tucker
crossly
indeed
how
delightful
lefferts
replied
what
exactly
is
your
definition
of
now
in
tucker
vocabulary
the
word
decadent
was
a
hate
word
it
signified
nothing
definite
except
that
he
disliked
the
person
to
whose
opinions
he
applied
it
he
had
several
others
of
the
same
sort
hysterical
and
being
those
most
often
in
use
this
being
so
he
really
could
define
the
word
and
so
he
pretended
not
to
hear
and
occupied
himself
flicking
an
imaginary
crumb
from
the
satin
lapel
of
his
coat
lefferts
who
had
no
wish
to
be
disagreeable
did
not
repeat
the
question
but
contented
himself
by
observing
that
he
had
never
tasted
such
delicious
soup
reed
shook
his
head
in
an
ecstasy
that
seemed
to
transcend
words
only
tucker
scowled
as
entered
at
this
moment
to
take
away
the
crane
who
was
growing
reckless
decided
to
let
her
share
the
compliment
the
gentlemen
enjoyed
the
soup
he
said
at
least
lefferts
and
reed
did
but
tucker
has
not
committed
himself
did
you
enjoy
the
soup
tuck
tucker
rapped
with
his
middle
finger
i
care
very
little
for
my
food
he
answered
well
said
crane
i
heard
of
hating
the
sin
and
loving
the
sinner
i
suppose
it
is
possible
to
hate
the
cooking
and
and
he
paused
i
did
not
say
i
hated
the
cooking
answered
tucker
i
only
say
i
am
not
interested
in
talking
about
it
all
the
time
all
right
said
burton
we
talk
about
something
else
and
you
shall
have
first
choice
of
a
topic
tuck
one
moment
before
we
begin
exclaimed
reed
i
must
ask
where
is
smithfield
crane
turned
to
him
smithfield
he
said
in
common
with
my
two
guests
the
housemaid
lily
and
the
boy
brindlebury
have
all
left
or
been
ejected
from
my
house
within
the
last
hours
you
mean
gasped
reed
that
you
and
tucker
and
the
cook
are
alone
in
the
house
i
regret
to
say
that
tucker
also
leaves
me
this
evening
but
but
began
reed
in
a
protest
too
earnest
to
find
words
on
the
instant
we
wo
discuss
the
matter
now
said
crane
i
have
several
things
to
talk
over
with
you
reed
after
dinner
in
the
meantime
he
added
looking
around
on
the
dreary
faces
of
all
but
lefferts
let
us
enjoy
ourselves
certainly
by
all
means
agreed
reed
but
i
would
just
like
to
ask
you
crane
you
ca
mean
you
do
intend
you
contemplate
oh
i
wo
trouble
you
with
my
immediate
plans
said
crane
and
added
turning
to
lefferts
my
experience
is
that
no
one
is
really
interested
in
any
one
else
plans
their
daily
routine
i
mean
and
small
domestic
complications
oh
come
i
do
know
about
that
answered
lefferts
on
whom
the
situation
was
beginning
vaguely
to
dawn
reed
struck
me
as
being
very
genuinely
interested
in
your
intentions
you
are
genuinely
interested
are
you
mr
reed
reed
was
interested
beyond
the
point
of
being
able
to
suspect
malice
yes
yes
he
said
eagerly
i
am
genuinely
sincerely
you
see
i
understand
what
would
be
said
in
a
community
like
this
what
would
be
thought
you
get
my
idea
i
own
i
do
answered
burton
suavely
but
i
will
say
this
much
that
in
deciding
my
conduct
i
have
usually
considered
my
own
opinion
rather
than
that
of
others
of
course
exactly
i
do
myself
said
reed
but
in
this
case
i
really
think
you
would
agree
with
me
if
i
could
make
myself
clear
doubtless
doubtless
answered
crane
and
seeing
that
was
again
in
the
room
he
went
on
what
is
it
exactly
that
we
are
talking
about
what
is
it
that
you
fear
reed
cast
an
agonized
look
at
the
cook
and
remained
speechless
but
tucker
with
more
experience
in
the
befogging
properties
of
language
rushed
to
his
assistance
it
perfectly
clear
what
he
means
he
said
reed
idea
is
that
in
a
small
community
like
this
the
conduct
of
every
individual
is
watched
scrutinized
and
discussed
however
humble
a
sphere
he
or
she
may
occupy
and
that
if
any
young
woman
should
find
herself
in
a
position
which
has
been
considered
a
compromising
one
by
every
author
and
dramatist
in
the
language
she
would
not
be
saved
from
the
inevitable
criticism
that
would
follow
by
the
mere
fact
that
but
here
something
very
unfortunate
happened
the
lip
of
the
pitcher
which
was
approaching
to
tucker
glass
suddenly
touched
his
shoulder
and
a
small
quantity
of
the
chilling
liquid
trickled
between
his
collar
and
his
neck
it
was
not
enough
to
be
called
a
stream
and
yet
it
was
distinctly
more
than
a
drop
it
was
sufficient
to
cut
short
his
sentence
oh
sir
i
so
sorry
she
cried
and
she
added
with
a
sort
of
wail
looking
at
crane
you
see
how
it
is
sir
i
not
used
to
waiting
on
table
i
think
she
waits
admirably
murmured
lefferts
aside
to
his
host
extremely
competent
i
call
it
said
crane
clearly
do
give
it
another
thought
see
he
added
glancing
at
tucker
face
which
was
distorted
with
anger
tucker
has
forgotten
it
already
oh
sir
how
kind
you
are
to
me
cried
the
cook
and
ran
hastily
into
the
pantry
from
which
a
sound
which
might
have
been
a
cough
was
instantly
heard
yours
is
a
strange
but
delightful
home
crane
observed
lefferts
i
do
really
recall
ever
having
experienced
anything
quite
like
it
you
refer
i
fancy
replied
crane
to
the
simple
peace
the
assured
confidence
that
that
something
unexpected
is
going
to
happen
within
the
next
ten
seconds
tucker
and
reed
both
absorbed
in
their
private
wrongs
were
for
an
instant
like
deaf
men
but
the
latter
having
now
dried
his
neck
and
as
much
of
his
collar
as
was
possible
showed
signs
of
coming
to
so
that
crane
included
both
in
the
conversation
lefferts
and
i
were
speaking
he
said
slightly
raising
his
voice
of
the
peculiar
atmosphere
that
makes
for
the
enjoyment
of
a
home
what
reed
do
you
think
is
most
essential
just
one
moment
crane
said
reed
i
want
to
say
a
word
more
of
that
other
subject
we
were
speaking
of
crane
seat
allowed
him
to
see
the
pantry
door
before
any
one
else
could
on
it
his
eyes
were
fixed
as
he
answered
thoughtfully
our
last
subject
now
let
me
see
what
was
that
it
was
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
fish
sir
said
a
gentle
voice
in
reed
ear
he
groaned
and
helped
himself
largely
and
in
silence
lefferts
who
was
really
pitied
his
distress
and
decided
to
change
the
topic
what
a
fine
old
house
this
is
he
said
glancing
around
the
room
who
does
it
belong
to
it
belongs
answered
tucker
to
a
family
named
revelly
a
family
who
held
a
highly
honored
position
in
the
history
of
our
country
until
they
took
the
wrong
side
in
war
in
this
part
of
the
country
sir
cried
reed
we
are
not
accustomed
to
thinking
it
the
wrong
side
tucker
bowed
slightly
i
believe
that
i
am
voicing
the
verdict
of
history
and
time
he
answered
it
was
in
remorse
perhaps
for
having
stirred
up
this
new
subject
of
dispute
that
lefferts
now
went
on
rapidly
too
rapidly
to
feel
his
way
well
this
present
generation
seems
to
be
an
amusing
lot
eliot
was
telling
me
about
them
last
night
he
says
one
of
the
girls
is
a
perfect
beauty
now
what
was
her
name
such
a
pretty
one
oh
yes
he
added
slightly
raising
his
voice
as
his
memory
gave
it
to
him
claudia
what
said
the
cook
nobody
spoke
to
you
said
crane
but
his
eyes
remained
fixed
on
her
long
and
meditatively
as
she
handed
the
sauce
for
the
fish
lefferts
continued
eliot
said
that
she
was
a
most
indiscriminating
fascinator
engaged
to
three
men
last
summer
to
his
knowledge
our
northern
girls
are
infants
compared
reed
suddenly
sprang
up
from
the
table
i
be
obliged
sir
he
said
if
you
tell
eliot
with
my
compliments
that
that
story
of
his
is
untrue
and
if
he
does
know
it
he
ought
to
i
do
blame
you
sir
a
stranger
for
repeating
all
you
hear
about
one
of
the
loveliest
young
ladies
in
the
country
but
i
do
blame
him
at
this
the
cook
approached
him
and
said
with
a
stern
civility
do
sit
down
and
eat
your
fish
sir
before
it
gets
cold
they
exchanged
a
long
and
bitter
glance
but
reed
sat
down
i
sure
you
believe
said
lefferts
that
i
sorry
to
have
said
anything
i
ought
not
particularly
about
any
friend
of
yours
reed
but
the
truth
is
i
thought
of
it
only
as
being
immensely
to
the
credit
of
the
young
lady
in
a
neighborhood
which
must
be
you
forgive
my
saying
rather
dull
if
you
not
fond
of
hunting
the
point
is
not
whether
it
is
to
her
credit
or
not
returned
reed
who
was
by
no
means
placated
the
point
is
that
it
is
not
true
probably
not
lefferts
agreed
only
he
added
after
a
thought
i
do
see
how
any
one
can
say
that
except
the
young
lady
herself
miss
claudia
revelly
answered
reed
is
one
of
the
most
respected
and
admired
young
ladies
in
the
state
i
may
say
in
the
whole
south
i
have
known
her
and
her
family
since
she
was
a
child
and
i
should
have
been
informed
if
anything
of
the
kind
had
taken
place
as
he
said
this
the
glance
that
the
cook
cast
at
him
was
indescribable
it
was
mingled
pity
and
wonder
as
much
as
to
say
what
hope
is
there
after
all
for
a
man
who
can
talk
like
that
undoubtedly
you
right
reed
said
lefferts
and
yet
i
have
never
heard
of
a
girl
announcing
more
than
one
engagement
at
a
time
although
it
has
come
within
my
experience
to
know
but
after
all
why
not
said
crane
perhaps
that
will
be
the
coming
fashion
we
shall
in
future
get
letters
from
our
friends
which
will
begin
want
you
to
know
of
the
three
great
happinesses
that
have
come
into
my
life
i
am
engaged
to
john
jones
peter
smith
and
paul
robinson
and
i
feel
almost
sure
that
one
of
these
three
early
next
june
seeing
that
reed
was
really
growing
angry
lefferts
hastened
to
interrupt
his
host
i
think
you
might
tell
us
reed
he
said
what
the
great
beauty
of
the
county
looks
like
i
ca
think
that
this
is
the
time
or
place
for
retailing
the
charms
of
a
young
lady
as
if
it
were
a
slave
market
answered
reed
and
it
seemed
to
crane
that
the
cook
who
had
come
in
to
change
the
plates
looked
a
little
bit
disappointed
no
not
as
if
it
were
a
slave
market
said
lefferts
because
of
course
it
is
i
can
see
no
reason
reed
said
crane
why
you
should
give
us
a
hint
as
to
whether
miss
revelly
is
blond
or
brunette
tall
or
short
perhaps
i
see
reasons
that
you
do
not
sir
answered
the
wretched
real
estate
man
well
said
crane
i
tell
you
what
must
have
seen
her
often
he
added
you
seen
miss
revelly
what
does
she
look
like
advanced
into
the
room
thoughtfully
well
sir
she
said
it
is
for
me
to
criticize
my
superiors
nor
to
say
a
word
against
a
young
lady
whom
reed
admires
so
much
but
i
have
my
own
reasons
sir
for
thinking
that
there
was
more
in
those
stories
of
her
engagement
than
perhaps
reed
himself
knows
servants
hear
a
good
deal
you
know
sir
and
they
do
say
that
miss
revelly
claudia
burst
from
reed
miss
claudia
revelly
i
should
say
the
cook
corrected
herself
well
sir
as
for
looks
let
me
see
she
a
tall
commanding
looking
lady
with
flashing
black
eyes
asked
crane
and
masses
of
hair
a
noble
brow
a
mouth
too
large
for
perfect
beauty
a
queenly
bearing
an
irresistible
dignity
of
manner
said
crane
i
feel
almost
as
if
miss
claudia
revelly
were
standing
before
me
oh
indeed
sir
if
it
were
she
it
you
who
would
be
standing
said
the
cook
for
my
part
said
crane
turning
again
to
the
table
i
had
imagined
her
to
myself
as
quite
different
i
had
supposed
her
small
with
tiny
hands
and
feet
and
a
mouth
he
was
looking
at
mouth
as
if
that
might
give
him
an
inspiration
when
reed
interrupted
i
regret
to
say
crane
he
said
that
if
this
conversation
continues
to
deal
disrespectfully
with
the
appearance
of
a
young
lady
for
whom
disrespectfully
cried
crane
i
assure
you
i
had
no
such
intention
i
leave
it
to
you
whether
anything
disrespectful
was
said
about
this
young
lady
it
did
not
seem
so
to
me
sir
answered
the
cook
with
all
her
gentlest
manner
but
she
added
glancing
humbly
at
reed
of
course
it
would
never
do
for
a
servant
like
me
to
be
setting
up
my
opinion
on
such
a
matter
against
a
gentleman
like
mr
reed
what
i
mean
is
if
miss
revelly
were
here
do
you
think
she
would
object
to
anything
we
have
said
indeed
i
sure
she
would
actually
have
enjoyed
it
sir
well
then
she
ought
not
shouted
reed
sternly
shook
her
head
sadly
ah
sir
she
said
young
ladies
like
miss
revelly
do
always
do
what
they
ought
to
if
report
speaks
true
may
i
ask
without
impertinence
burton
said
tucker
at
this
point
whether
it
is
your
intention
to
give
us
nothing
whatsoever
to
drink
with
our
dinner
no
certainly
not
cried
crane
why
have
you
served
the
champagne
the
reason
for
this
omission
was
presently
only
too
clear
had
not
the
faintest
idea
of
how
to
open
the
bottle
crane
listening
with
one
ear
to
his
guests
watched
her
wrestling
with
it
in
a
corner
holding
it
as
if
it
were
a
venomous
reptile
for
my
part
tucker
was
saying
i
have
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
with
the
stand
reed
has
taken
any
discussion
of
a
woman
behind
her
back
runs
at
least
the
risk
suddenly
crane
shouted
look
out
do
do
that
he
was
speaking
not
to
tucker
but
to
the
cook
his
warning
however
came
too
late
there
was
the
sound
of
breaking
glass
and
a
deep
stain
dyed
the
napkin
in
hand
all
four
chairs
were
pushed
back
all
four
men
sprang
to
her
side
let
me
see
your
hand
is
it
badly
cut
an
artery
runs
near
there
is
there
any
glass
in
it
they
crowded
around
her
nor
did
any
one
of
them
seem
to
be
averse
to
taking
the
case
entirely
into
his
own
control
there
are
antiseptics
and
bandages
upstairs
said
crane
better
let
me
wash
it
well
at
the
tap
in
the
pantry
urged
reed
does
it
hurt
horribly
asked
lefferts
tucker
putting
on
his
glasses
observed
i
have
had
some
experience
in
surgery
and
if
you
will
let
me
examine
the
wound
by
a
good
light
oh
gentlemen
said
this
is
absurd
it
nothing
but
a
scratch
do
sit
down
and
finish
your
dinner
and
let
me
get
through
my
work
as
the
injury
did
not
after
a
closer
observation
seem
to
be
serious
the
four
men
obeyed
but
they
did
so
in
silence
not
even
lefferts
and
crane
could
banter
any
more
tucker
had
never
made
any
pretense
of
recovering
his
temper
and
reed
seemed
to
be
revolving
thoughts
of
deep
import
as
they
rose
from
table
crane
touched
the
arm
of
reed
come
into
the
office
will
you
i
have
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
and
i
to
you
said
reed
with
feeling
xii
once
in
the
little
office
crane
did
not
immediately
speak
he
drew
up
two
chairs
put
a
log
on
the
fire
turned
up
the
lamp
and
in
short
made
it
evident
that
he
intended
to
do
that
cruel
deed
sometimes
perpetrated
by
parents
guardians
and
schoolmasters
in
interviews
of
this
sort
he
was
going
to
leave
it
to
the
culprit
to
make
a
beginning
reed
fidgeting
in
a
nearby
chair
did
not
at
once
yield
to
this
compulsion
but
finally
the
calm
with
which
crane
was
balancing
a
pen
on
a
pencil
broke
down
his
resolution
and
he
said
crossly
i
understood
you
had
something
to
say
to
me
mr
crane
crane
threw
aside
pencil
and
pen
i
thought
it
might
be
the
other
way
he
answered
but
yes
if
you
like
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
i
have
decided
to
break
my
lease
and
leave
this
house
you
do
mean
to
go
without
paying
the
second
instalment
of
the
rent
why
not
the
revellys
have
broken
or
rather
have
never
fulfilled
their
part
of
the
contract
i
took
the
house
on
the
written
understanding
that
servants
were
to
be
supplied
and
you
are
my
witness
reed
that
i
have
no
one
left
but
a
cook
oh
come
crane
we
only
agreed
to
provide
the
servants
we
could
not
guarantee
that
you
would
not
dismiss
them
you
must
own
they
showed
no
inclination
to
leave
the
house
no
i
not
deny
that
returned
burton
grimly
no
sane
man
continued
reed
eagerly
would
allow
the
payment
of
his
rent
to
depend
on
whether
or
not
you
chose
to
keep
a
staff
of
servants
in
many
ways
above
the
average
you
not
deny
i
think
sir
that
the
cooking
has
been
above
the
average
crane
had
reached
a
state
of
mind
in
which
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
discuss
even
the
culinary
powers
of
particularly
with
reed
and
so
he
slightly
shifted
the
ground
let
us
he
said
run
over
the
reasons
for
which
i
dismissed
them
the
housemaid
for
calling
one
of
my
guests
an
old
harridan
the
boy
for
habitually
smoking
my
cigarettes
for
attempting
to
strike
tucker
and
finally
for
stealing
a
valuable
miniature
belonging
to
the
house
the
butler
for
again
introducing
this
same
larcenous
boy
into
the
house
disguised
as
a
lame
old
man
the
question
is
not
whether
i
should
have
kept
them
but
whether
i
should
not
stay
on
here
and
have
them
all
arrested
reed
face
changed
oh
i
hope
you
wo
do
that
crane
he
said
burton
saw
his
advantage
i
should
not
care
he
answered
to
go
through
life
feeling
i
had
been
responsible
for
turning
a
dangerous
gang
loose
upon
the
countryside
they
are
not
that
sir
i
pledge
my
word
they
are
not
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
evidence
against
that
pledge
you
doubt
my
word
sir
i
feel
there
is
much
more
to
be
explained
than
you
seem
willing
to
admit
for
instance
how
comes
it
that
you
are
a
i
will
not
say
welcome
but
at
least
assured
visitor
in
my
kitchen
reed
felt
himself
coloring
i
do
not
feel
called
upon
he
replied
to
explain
my
conduct
to
any
one
in
that
case
said
crane
getting
to
his
feet
this
interview
might
as
well
end
i
shall
leave
and
if
you
and
your
friends
the
revellys
feel
yourselves
aggrieved
we
can
only
take
the
matter
into
court
if
the
record
of
these
servants
is
as
excellent
as
you
seem
to
think
they
can
have
nothing
to
fear
if
it
is
the
whole
matter
will
be
cleared
up
this
was
the
crisis
of
the
conversation
for
as
crane
moved
to
the
door
reed
stopped
him
wait
a
moment
crane
he
said
there
are
circumstances
in
this
connection
that
you
do
not
know
yes
i
guessed
that
much
if
you
will
sit
down
i
should
like
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
crane
yielded
and
sat
down
without
giving
reed
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
his
nervousness
at
the
expected
revelation
was
as
extreme
as
reed
the
revellys
crane
are
among
the
most
respected
of
our
southern
gentry
they
fought
for
the
original
liberties
of
this
country
and
in
the
war
of
secession
crane
nodded
i
know
my
history
mr
reed
but
sir
their
distinguished
position
and
high
abilities
have
not
saved
them
from
financial
reverses
the
grandfather
lost
everything
in
the
war
and
the
present
owner
henry
patrick
revelly
has
not
been
completely
successful
last
winter
a
breakdown
in
his
health
compelled
him
to
leave
the
country
at
short
notice
his
four
children
four
children
reed
two
girls
and
two
boys
four
grown
children
crane
the
eldest
is
the
youngest
seventeen
they
were
left
with
a
roof
over
their
heads
and
a
sum
of
money
a
small
sum
to
provide
for
them
during
the
absence
of
their
parents
not
a
satisfactory
arrangement
sir
but
made
in
haste
and
distress
revelly
devotion
to
her
husband
is
such
that
in
her
alarm
for
him
she
did
not
perhaps
sufficiently
consider
her
children
at
the
moment
when
left
alone
their
difficulties
began
to
press
upon
them
your
offer
your
generous
offer
for
the
house
was
made
there
was
no
time
to
submit
it
to
their
parents
nor
to
be
candid
with
you
would
there
have
been
the
slightest
chance
of
revelly
accepting
it
he
has
never
been
able
to
tolerate
the
mere
suggestion
of
renting
revelly
hall
but
the
four
young
people
felt
differently
it
was
natural
it
was
in
my
opinion
commendable
that
they
decided
to
move
out
of
their
home
for
the
sake
of
realizing
a
large
sum
the
largest
sum
probably
that
had
come
into
the
family
purse
for
many
years
but
an
obstacle
soon
appeared
you
had
insisted
that
servants
should
be
provided
this
was
impossible
they
tried
earnestly
miss
claudia
told
me
herself
that
she
went
everywhere
within
a
radius
of
twenty
miles
except
to
the
jails
at
last
it
became
a
question
of
refusing
your
offer
or
of
of
i
believe
you
have
already
guessed
the
alternative
this
is
not
a
time
for
the
exercise
of
my
creative
faculties
reed
what
was
their
decision
reed
discomfort
increased
i
wish
you
could
have
been
present
as
i
was
crane
on
that
occasion
we
were
sitting
round
the
fire
in
the
depressed
that
miss
claudia
mission
had
not
succeeded
when
suddenly
she
said
with
a
determination
quite
at
variance
with
her
gentle
appearance
i
found
a
cook
for
him
and
a
mighty
good
one
too
did
you
find
her
i
asked
in
astonishment
for
only
a
moment
before
she
had
been
confessing
absolute
failure
found
her
she
answered
charity
begins
i
own
that
even
then
i
did
not
get
the
idea
but
her
brother
paul
who
always
understands
her
saw
at
once
what
was
in
her
mind
she
went
on
found
an
excellent
cook
a
good
butler
a
rather
inefficient
housemaid
and
a
dangerous
extra
boy
and
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
her
family
as
she
spoke
her
meaning
was
clear
they
themselves
were
to
take
the
places
of
the
servants
they
could
not
find
as
paul
pointed
out
the
plan
had
the
advantage
of
saving
them
the
trouble
of
finding
board
and
lodgings
elsewhere
miss
lily
was
opposed
from
the
start
her
nature
exceedingly
refined
and
retiring
revolted
but
no
one
in
the
revelly
family
can
bear
up
against
the
combined
wills
of
paul
and
miss
claudia
how
the
plan
was
carried
out
you
know
there
was
a
short
silence
it
was
now
some
days
since
crane
had
suspected
the
identity
of
his
servants
an
hour
since
had
turned
at
the
name
of
claudia
and
made
him
sure
nevertheless
the
certainty
that
reed
confession
brought
was
very
grateful
to
him
so
grateful
that
he
feared
his
expression
would
betray
him
and
he
assumed
a
look
of
stern
blankness
seeing
this
reed
thought
it
necessary
to
plead
the
culprits
cause
after
all
crane
was
there
not
courage
and
needed
you
see
this
explains
everything
the
miniature
of
their
grandmother
was
taken
upstairs
for
fear
its
likeness
to
miss
claudia
might
betray
them
miss
lily
who
as
i
said
never
approved
of
the
plan
was
constitutionally
unable
to
be
calm
under
the
accusation
of
stealing
a
hat
made
as
i
understand
rather
roughly
by
falkener
i
should
be
very
sorry
if
your
opinion
of
the
revelly
family
i
ca
see
what
my
opinion
has
to
do
with
the
situation
said
crane
every
moment
now
that
kept
him
from
claudia
was
to
him
an
intolerable
bore
he
drew
his
toward
him
however
your
story
has
convinced
me
of
this
my
only
course
is
to
pay
my
rent
in
full
reed
began
to
feel
the
pride
of
the
successful
diplomat
and
one
other
thing
crane
you
see
the
necessity
of
not
mentioning
this
it
would
make
a
great
deal
of
talk
in
the
country
a
young
lady
name
burton
rose
quickly
it
was
not
agreeable
to
him
to
have
reed
pleading
with
him
for
the
preservation
of
claudia
reputation
here
your
check
he
said
reed
pressed
on
and
another
thing
will
now
be
equally
clear
to
you
i
am
sure
miss
revelly
can
not
possibly
spend
the
night
here
alone
that
replied
crane
is
a
question
for
miss
revelly
herself
to
decide
my
motors
are
at
her
disposal
to
take
her
anywhere
she
may
choose
to
go
and
he
opened
the
door
as
if
he
expected
that
reed
would
now
take
his
departure
but
reed
did
not
move
i
can
not
go
away
and
leave
miss
revelly
here
alone
with
you
he
said
of
the
two
alternatives
said
crane
you
might
find
it
more
difficult
to
stay
in
my
house
without
my
consent
but
i
leave
it
this
way
do
you
think
miss
revelly
would
regard
your
presence
as
a
protection
i
do
understand
you
sir
your
last
visit
to
my
kitchen
did
not
i
believe
inspire
her
with
confidence
shall
we
leave
the
decision
to
her
reed
went
out
in
silence
he
had
had
no
reconciliation
with
since
that
fatal
kiss
in
the
kitchen
and
he
knew
she
would
not
now
side
with
him
he
decided
to
go
away
and
find
her
brothers
lefferts
meanwhile
left
alone
had
stretched
himself
on
a
sofa
and
was
smoking
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
my
dear
fellow
cried
crane
with
some
compunction
were
you
waiting
to
see
me
i
was
waiting
for
my
motor
answered
the
poet
you
know
that
imagining
this
to
be
an
ordinary
i
ordered
it
back
at
a
quarter
before
eleven
where
tucker
asked
burton
at
this
moment
a
step
was
heard
on
the
stairs
and
tucker
dressed
in
a
neat
gray
suit
adapted
to
traveling
wearing
a
cap
and
goggles
and
carrying
his
bag
descended
the
stairs
on
seeing
his
host
he
approached
and
held
out
his
hand
burton
he
said
i
hope
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
forgive
me
for
having
tried
too
hard
to
serve
you
for
myself
i
entirely
forgive
your
hasty
rudeness
i
hope
we
part
friends
crane
hesitated
and
then
shook
hands
with
his
lawyer
there
no
use
in
pretending
tucker
he
said
that
i
feel
exactly
friendly
to
you
and
if
you
forgive
my
saying
so
i
ca
believe
that
you
feel
so
to
me
you
and
i
have
got
on
each
other
nerves
lately
and
that
the
truth
how
much
that
means
only
time
can
show
sometimes
it
is
very
important
sometimes
very
trivial
but
while
such
a
state
exists
i
agree
with
you
that
two
people
are
better
apart
here
who
had
just
finished
putting
the
in
order
came
out
into
the
hall
followed
by
willoughby
as
she
saw
tucker
she
had
one
of
her
evil
inspirations
springing
forward
she
exclaimed
oh
was
it
a
pity
sir
you
had
to
do
your
own
packing
let
me
put
your
bag
in
the
motor
for
you
tucker
was
again
caught
by
one
of
his
moments
of
indecision
he
did
not
want
to
carry
his
luggage
but
he
did
not
consider
it
dignified
to
wrestle
with
her
for
the
possession
of
it
so
that
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
she
had
seized
it
and
carried
it
down
the
steps
but
he
was
not
utterly
without
resource
he
had
been
holding
a
bill
in
his
hand
more
from
recollections
of
other
visits
than
because
he
now
expected
to
find
any
one
left
to
fee
this
as
came
up
the
steps
he
thrust
into
her
hand
saying
clearly
thank
you
my
girl
there
for
your
trouble
just
glanced
at
it
and
then
crumpling
it
into
a
ball
she
threw
it
across
the
hall
willoughby
who
like
many
other
sheltered
creatures
retained
his
playfulness
late
in
life
bounded
after
it
caught
it
up
in
his
paws
threw
it
about
and
finally
set
on
it
with
his
sharp
little
teeth
and
bit
it
to
pieces
but
neither
tucker
nor
the
cook
waited
to
see
the
end
he
got
into
the
car
and
rolled
away
and
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
crane
glanced
at
lefferts
to
whom
plainly
his
duty
as
host
pointed
and
then
he
hurried
down
the
kitchen
stairs
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
xiii
was
shaking
out
her
last
dishcloth
her
head
turned
well
over
her
shoulder
to
avoid
the
shower
of
spray
that
came
from
it
he
seated
himself
on
the
and
watched
her
for
some
time
in
silence
and
is
that
the
way
you
treat
all
presents
he
asked
throwing
them
to
willoughby
to
tear
to
pieces
that
was
not
a
present
sir
presents
are
between
equals
i
always
thought
then
i
do
see
how
you
can
ever
hope
to
get
any
she
looked
at
him
and
smiled
your
talk
is
too
deep
and
clever
for
a
poor
girl
like
me
to
understand
sir
he
smiled
back
they
all
gone
he
said
the
news
did
not
seem
to
disturb
the
cook
in
the
least
reed
would
have
been
shocked
by
the
calmness
with
which
she
received
it
illustration
and
there
was
no
truth
in
it
and
now
you
all
alone
sir
she
replied
absolutely
alone
she
was
still
pattering
about
the
kitchen
putting
the
last
things
to
rights
but
or
so
it
seemed
to
crane
a
little
busier
than
her
occupation
warranted
they
left
early
sir
did
they
but
then
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
they
were
really
enjoying
themselves
not
even
lefferts
though
he
is
such
an
amusing
gentleman
every
one
seemed
sad
sir
except
you
i
was
sad
too
indeed
sir
something
was
said
at
dinner
that
distressed
me
deeply
by
whom
sir
by
you
she
did
not
stop
her
work
nor
seem
very
much
surprised
but
of
course
she
asked
what
her
unfortunate
speech
had
been
i
was
sorry
to
hear
you
say
you
believed
in
miss
revelly
triple
engagement
at
this
she
did
stop
short
and
immediately
in
his
vicinity
but
i
did
not
know
you
knew
miss
revelly
yet
i
do
and
when
i
was
describing
her
it
was
as
if
i
saw
her
before
me
i
am
sorry
i
said
anything
about
a
friend
of
yours
sir
i
had
supposed
she
was
quite
a
stranger
to
you
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
too
as
if
she
were
a
stranger
crane
answered
each
time
i
see
her
she
seems
to
me
so
lovely
and
wonderful
and
miraculous
that
it
is
as
if
i
saw
her
for
the
first
time
sometimes
when
i
am
away
from
her
it
seems
to
me
quite
ridiculous
to
believe
that
such
a
creature
exists
in
this
rather
tiresome
old
world
and
i
feel
like
rushing
back
from
wherever
i
am
to
assure
myself
that
she
is
just
a
creation
of
my
own
passionate
desire
in
this
sense
i
think
she
will
always
be
a
stranger
always
be
a
surprise
to
me
even
if
i
should
have
the
great
felicity
of
spending
the
rest
of
my
days
with
her
does
it
bore
you
to
hear
me
talking
this
way
about
my
own
feelings
did
not
answer
indeed
something
seemed
to
suggest
that
she
could
not
speak
but
she
shook
her
head
and
burton
went
on
so
you
see
why
it
distressed
me
to
hear
from
so
good
an
authority
as
yourself
that
she
had
already
engaged
herself
three
times
it
is
not
that
i
am
of
a
jealous
nature
but
when
i
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
if
she
should
say
yes
i
should
want
to
feel
sure
that
that
meant
oh
mr
crane
said
i
said
that
to
make
reed
angry
and
there
was
no
truth
in
it
there
was
a
pause
looked
down
and
wriggled
her
shoulders
a
little
well
she
admitted
there
was
some
truth
in
it
they
were
not
exactly
engagements
we
think
in
this
part
of
the
world
that
there
something
almost
too
harsh
in
a
flat
no
oh
the
truth
is
she
added
suddenly
changing
her
tone
that
girls
do
know
what
they
doing
until
they
find
that
they
have
fallen
in
love
themselves
and
do
you
think
by
any
chance
that
this
revelation
may
have
come
to
miss
revelly
i
know
right
well
it
has
answered
oh
my
dear
love
cried
crane
and
took
her
into
his
arms
the
kitchen
clock
loudly
ticking
looked
down
upon
them
on
one
side
and
willoughby
loudly
purring
looked
up
at
them
from
the
other
and
a
good
deal
of
ticking
and
purring
was
done
before
claudia
broke
the
silence
by
saying
like
one
to
whom
a
good
idea
has
come
rather
late
but
i
never
said
it
was
through
you
that
the
revelation
came
you
must
say
that
it
has
even
in
fun
not
yet
when
may
i
when
we
been
married
five
years
sometime
later
when
that
is
to
say
they
had
talked
a
little
longer
in
the
kitchen
and
then
shut
it
up
for
the
night
and
had
gone
and
sat
a
little
while
in
the
parlor
so
that
he
might
realize
that
she
really
was
miss
claudia
revelly
and
they
had
sat
a
little
while
in
the
office
so
that
she
might
act
out
for
him
the
impression
he
had
made
an
her
during
that
first
famous
interview
when
he
had
reproved
her
conduct
when
all
these
important
conversations
had
taken
place
crane
at
last
took
her
hand
and
said
gravely
i
must
keep
you
up
any
longer
good
night
my
darling
and
he
added
after
an
instant
i
so
glad
so
grateful
that
your
mind
does
work
like
reed
and
tucker
like
theirs
in
what
way
i
glad
you
have
thought
it
necessary
to
make
any
protest
at
our
being
here
alone
a
slight
motion
of
his
beloved
shoulders
told
him
she
was
not
fully
at
one
with
him
how
foolish
burton
of
course
i
trust
you
absolutely
only
only
what
she
evidently
felt
that
it
was
a
moment
when
something
decisive
must
be
done
for
she
came
and
laid
her
head
not
on
his
shoulder
but
as
near
as
she
could
reach
which
was
about
in
the
turn
of
his
elbow
his
arm
was
coldly
limp
only
what
he
repeated
only
we
not
really
alone
what
do
you
mean
claudia
they
all
here
my
brothers
and
sister
what
smithfield
and
lily
and
even
brindlebury
she
nodded
in
as
much
space
as
she
had
where
are
they
he
asked
they
playing
in
the
garret
and
oh
she
added
with
a
sudden
spasm
of
recollection
they
be
so
hungry
they
have
had
anything
to
eat
for
ages
i
promised
to
bring
them
something
as
soon
as
the
house
was
quiet
only
you
put
everything
out
of
my
head
we
give
them
a
party
in
the
our
first
said
crane
i
write
the
invitation
and
we
send
lefferts
to
the
garret
with
it
do
you
think
i
better
go
up
and
explain
said
claudia
the
invitation
will
explain
answered
burton
it
read
burton
crane
and
miss
claudia
revelly
request
the
pleasure
of
the
company
at
supper
immediately
they
roused
lefferts
who
had
by
this
time
fallen
into
a
comfortable
sleep
just
run
up
and
give
this
note
to
the
people
you
find
in
the
garret
there
a
good
fellow
said
crane
lefferts
sat
up
rubbing
his
eyes
the
people
i
find
in
the
garret
he
murmured
but
how
about
the
little
black
men
in
the
chimney
and
the
ghosts
who
live
in
the
wall
this
is
the
strangest
house
crane
the
very
strangest
house
i
ever
knew
but
he
took
the
note
and
wandered
slowly
upstairs
with
it
shaking
his
head
on
the
landing
of
the
second
story
his
eye
caught
the
whisk
of
a
skirt
and
pursuing
it
instantly
he
came
upon
lily
he
cornered
her
in
the
angle
of
the
stairs
hold
on
he
said
i
have
a
note
for
you
at
least
i
have
if
you
are
one
of
the
people
who
live
in
the
garret
lily
knowing
nothing
of
the
explanation
that
had
taken
place
between
reed
and
crane
was
not
a
little
alarmed
at
being
thus
caught
in
a
house
from
which
she
had
been
so
recently
dismissed
she
did
not
think
quickly
in
a
crisis
and
now
she
could
find
nothing
to
say
but
i
do
exactly
live
in
the
garret
how
interesting
it
would
be
observed
lefferts
if
you
would
sit
down
here
on
the
stairs
and
tell
me
who
you
are
there
nothing
to
tell
said
lily
wondering
what
she
had
better
admit
i
just
the
housemaid
oh
cried
lefferts
then
there
are
lots
of
things
to
tell
i
have
always
wanted
to
ask
housemaids
a
number
of
questions
for
instance
why
is
it
that
you
always
drop
the
broom
with
which
you
sweep
the
stairs
at
six
in
the
morning
why
do
you
fancy
it
will
conduce
to
any
comfort
to
shut
the
blinds
and
turn
on
all
the
lights
in
a
bedroom
on
a
hot
summer
evening
why
do
you
hide
the
pillows
and
extra
covering
so
that
one
never
finds
them
until
one
is
packing
to
go
away
the
next
morning
if
you
are
a
housemaid
you
do
these
things
and
if
you
do
these
things
you
must
know
why
you
do
them
lily
smiled
i
afraid
i
was
a
very
poor
housemaid
she
answered
anyhow
i
not
even
that
any
more
i
was
dismissed
indeed
said
lefferts
now
that
must
be
an
interesting
experience
i
have
had
several
perfectly
good
businesses
drop
from
under
me
but
i
have
never
been
dismissed
might
i
ask
what
led
to
it
in
your
case
a
reminiscent
smile
stole
over
lily
face
crane
dismissed
me
she
said
for
saying
something
which
i
believe
he
thought
himself
i
called
falkener
an
old
harridan
lefferts
shouted
with
pleasure
if
crane
had
had
a
spark
of
intellectual
honesty
he
have
raised
your
wages
he
said
it
just
what
he
wanted
to
say
himself
oh
i
was
glad
to
be
dismissed
returned
she
i
never
approved
of
the
whole
plan
anyhow
and
then
fearing
she
had
betrayed
too
much
she
added
and
now
you
might
tell
me
who
you
are
my
name
is
lefferts
any
relation
to
the
poet
it
would
be
impossible
to
deny
that
this
unexpected
proof
of
his
fame
was
agreeable
to
lefferts
the
conversation
on
the
stairs
became
more
absorbing
and
the
note
was
less
likely
to
be
delivered
at
all
in
the
meantime
claudia
while
setting
the
table
in
the
had
sent
crane
down
to
the
kitchen
floor
to
get
something
out
of
the
as
crane
approached
this
object
about
which
so
many
sentimental
recollections
gathered
he
saw
he
had
been
anticipated
a
figure
was
already
busy
extracting
from
it
a
plate
at
his
step
the
figure
turned
quickly
it
was
brindlebury
even
brindlebury
seemed
to
appreciate
that
after
all
that
had
occurred
in
connection
with
his
last
departure
to
be
caught
once
again
in
crane
house
was
a
serious
matter
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
to
save
himself
by
a
confession
that
he
was
one
of
the
revellys
but
to
tell
this
without
the
consent
of
his
brother
and
sisters
would
have
been
considered
traitorous
in
the
extreme
he
backed
away
from
the
crane
he
said
with
unusual
seriousness
you
probably
feel
that
an
explanation
is
due
you
and
there
he
stopped
not
being
able
at
the
moment
to
think
of
anything
to
say
crane
took
pity
on
him
brindlebury
he
said
it
would
be
ungenerous
of
me
to
conceal
from
you
that
our
relative
positions
are
reversed
at
the
present
moment
the
power
is
all
in
your
hands
have
a
cigarette
i
believe
you
used
to
like
this
brand
only
when
i
had
smoked
all
my
own
you
see
brindlebury
it
is
not
only
that
i
am
obliged
to
forgive
you
i
have
to
go
further
i
have
to
make
up
to
you
for
the
truth
is
brindlebury
that
i
want
to
marry
your
sister
you
want
to
marry
more
than
i
can
tell
you
and
what
does
she
say
she
likes
the
idea
bless
my
soul
you
are
going
to
be
my
no
rose
without
its
thorn
i
understand
the
situation
was
too
tempting
to
the
boy
love
of
a
joke
he
seated
himself
on
the
top
of
the
and
folded
his
arms
i
do
not
know
he
said
that
i
should
be
justified
in
giving
my
consent
to
any
such
marriage
would
it
tend
to
make
my
sister
happy
the
woman
who
marries
above
her
social
position
the
man
who
marries
his
cook
is
bound
to
regret
it
have
you
considered
crane
that
however
you
may
value
my
sister
yourself
many
of
your
proud
friends
would
not
receive
her
to
my
mind
brindlebury
these
social
distinctions
are
very
unimportant
even
you
i
should
be
willing
to
have
to
dinner
now
and
then
when
we
were
alone
the
deuce
you
would
said
brindlebury
and
added
but
suppose
my
sister
lack
of
refinement
i
ca
let
you
talk
like
that
even
in
fun
revelly
said
crane
get
off
your
and
let
us
go
back
to
claudia
ah
you
knew
all
along
i
have
suspected
for
some
time
reed
told
me
this
evening
but
when
they
reached
the
claudia
was
not
there
she
had
gone
herself
to
tell
her
news
to
her
brother
paul
he
was
sitting
alone
in
the
garret
with
the
remnants
of
the
game
of
before
him
claudia
came
and
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
but
he
did
not
move
do
you
know
what
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
do
he
said
i
mean
to
go
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
this
to
crane
the
game
is
about
up
and
i
do
think
he
had
a
square
deal
he
a
nice
fellow
and
i
like
to
put
myself
straight
with
him
claudia
remained
standing
behind
her
brother
as
she
asked
you
like
him
paul
very
much
indeed
i
think
he
behaved
mighty
well
through
all
this
do
you
like
him
there
was
an
instant
pause
and
then
claudia
answered
simply
i
love
him
paul
her
brother
sprang
to
his
feet
do
say
that
even
to
yourself
my
dear
he
said
you
do
know
what
men
of
his
sort
are
like
spoilt
run
after
he
not
like
the
men
you
ruled
over
all
your
life
no
indeed
he
not
said
claudia
my
dear
girl
her
brother
went
on
seriously
this
is
not
like
you
you
must
put
this
out
of
your
head
after
all
that
ought
to
be
very
hard
you
hardly
known
the
man
more
than
a
few
days
paul
that
shows
you
do
know
what
love
is
it
has
anything
to
do
with
time
or
your
own
will
it
just
there
in
an
instant
people
talk
as
if
it
were
common
as
if
every
one
fell
in
love
but
i
do
believe
they
do
not
like
this
look
at
me
i
only
known
this
man
as
you
say
a
little
while
i
only
talked
to
him
a
few
times
and
some
of
those
were
disagreeable
and
yet
the
idea
of
spending
my
life
with
him
not
only
seems
natural
but
all
the
rest
of
my
life
you
and
my
home
seem
strange
and
unfamiliar
i
feel
the
way
you
do
when
you
been
living
abroad
hearing
strange
languages
and
suddenly
some
one
speaks
to
you
in
your
own
native
tongue
when
burton
burton
did
i
tell
you
we
engaged
my
dear
claudia
you
must
admit
we
do
really
know
anything
about
him
you
have
the
rest
of
your
life
for
finding
out
paul
they
went
downstairs
presently
to
supper
a
meal
that
promised
to
be
a
good
deal
more
agreeable
than
dinner
had
been
for
all
paul
expressed
doubts
he
had
every
disposition
to
make
himself
pleasant
to
his
future
and
even
lily
had
felt
his
charm
lefferts
the
only
person
in
the
dark
as
to
the
whole
situation
served
as
an
excellent
audience
all
four
recounted
together
and
in
turn
the
whole
story
from
the
moment
when
the
idea
had
first
occurred
to
claudia
at
eleven
years
of
age
that
she
would
like
to
learn
to
cook
down
to
the
subtlest
allusion
of
that
evening
then
suddenly
there
was
a
loud
peal
at
the
front
every
one
knew
instantly
what
it
was
reed
returning
to
make
one
more
effort
to
save
claudia
reputation
well
said
paul
sinking
down
in
his
chair
and
thrusting
his
hands
still
deeper
into
his
pockets
i
sha
let
him
in
my
future
depends
on
my
getting
over
the
habit
of
answering
bells
same
here
said
brindlebury
i
certainly
sha
open
the
door
for
the
man
said
crane
and
claudia
shall
go
only
over
my
dead
body
again
the
bell
rang
lily
rose
i
shall
let
him
in
she
said
i
think
you
are
all
very
unjust
to
randolph
claudia
smiled
as
her
sister
left
the
room
there
she
said
that
all
right
no
one
has
such
a
good
effect
on
randolph
as
lily
has
in
fifteen
minutes
he
will
be
perfectly
calm
and
polite
in
half
an
hour
she
will
have
persuaded
him
he
likes
things
better
the
way
they
are
i
should
think
said
lefferts
glancing
at
claudia
that
it
might
take
her
a
little
longer
than
that
it
did
take
her
a
