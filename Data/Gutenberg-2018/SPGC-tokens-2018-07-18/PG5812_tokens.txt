new

you
soon
find
your
dreams
of
india
rising
in
a
sort
of
vague
and
luscious
moonlight
above
the
of
your
opaque
consciousness
and
softly
lighting
up
a
thousand
forgotten
details
which
were
parts
of
a
vision
that
had
once
been
vivid
to
you
when
you
were
a
boy
and
steeped
your
spirit
in
tales
of
the
east
the
barbaric
gorgeousnesses
for
instance
and
the
princely
titles
the
sumptuous
titles
the
sounding
titles
how
good
they
taste
in
the
mouth
the
nizam
of
hyderabad
the
maharajah
of
travancore
the
nabob
of
jubbelpore
the
begum
of
bhopal
the
nawab
of
mysore
the
rance
of
gulnare
the
ahkoond
of
swat
the
rao
of
rohilkund
the
gaikwar
of
baroda
indeed
it
is
a
country
that
runs
richly
to
name
the
great
god
vishnu
has
special
ones
peculiarly
holy
ones
names
just
for
sunday
use
only
i
learned
the
whole
of
vishnu
by
heart
once
but
they
would
stay
i
remember
any
of
them
now
but
john
and
the
romances
connected
with
those
princely
native
houses
to
this
day
they
are
always
turning
up
just
as
in
the
old
old
times
they
were
sweating
out
a
romance
in
an
english
court
in
bombay
a
while
before
we
were
there
in
this
case
a
native
prince
years
old
who
has
been
enjoying
his
titles
and
dignities
and
estates
unmolested
for
fourteen
years
is
suddenly
haled
into
court
on
the
charge
that
he
is
rightfully
no
prince
at
all
but
a
pauper
peasant
that
the
real
prince
died
when
two
and
years
old
that
the
death
was
concealed
and
a
peasant
child
smuggled
into
the
royal
cradle
and
that
this
present
incumbent
was
that
smuggled
substitute
this
is
the
very
material
that
so
many
oriental
tales
have
been
made
of
the
case
of
that
great
prince
the
gaikwar
of
baroda
is
a
reversal
of
the
theme
when
that
throne
fell
vacant
no
heir
could
be
found
for
some
time
but
at
last
one
was
found
in
the
person
of
a
peasant
child
who
was
making
mud
pies
in
a
village
street
and
having
an
innocent
good
time
but
his
pedigree
was
straight
he
was
the
true
prince
and
he
has
reigned
ever
since
with
none
to
dispute
his
right
lately
there
was
another
hunt
for
an
heir
to
another
princely
house
and
one
was
found
who
was
circumstanced
about
as
the
gaikwar
had
been
his
fathers
were
traced
back
in
humble
life
along
a
branch
of
the
ancestral
tree
to
the
point
where
it
joined
the
stem
fourteen
generations
ago
and
his
heirship
was
thereby
squarely
established
the
tracing
was
done
by
means
of
the
records
of
one
of
the
great
hindoo
shrines
where
princes
on
pilgrimage
record
their
names
and
the
date
of
their
visit
this
is
to
keep
the
prince
religious
account
straight
and
his
spiritual
person
safe
but
the
record
has
the
added
value
of
keeping
the
pedigree
authentic
too
when
i
think
of
bombay
now
at
this
distance
of
time
i
seem
to
have
a
kaleidoscope
at
my
eye
and
i
hear
the
clash
of
the
glass
bits
as
the
splendid
figures
change
and
fall
apart
and
flash
into
new
forms
figure
after
figure
and
with
the
birth
of
each
new
form
i
feel
my
skin
crinkle
and
my
tingle
with
a
new
thrill
of
wonder
and
delight
these
remembered
pictures
float
past
me
in
a
sequence
of
contracts
following
the
same
order
always
and
always
whirling
by
and
disappearing
with
the
swiftness
of
a
dream
leaving
me
with
the
sense
that
the
actuality
was
the
experience
of
an
hour
at
most
whereas
it
really
covered
days
i
think
the
series
begins
with
the
hiring
of
a
bearer
native
a
person
who
should
be
selected
with
some
care
because
as
long
as
he
is
in
your
employ
he
will
be
about
as
near
to
you
as
your
clothes
in
india
your
day
may
be
said
to
begin
with
the
bearer
knock
on
the
bedroom
door
accompanied
by
a
formula
of
words
a
formula
which
is
intended
to
mean
that
the
bath
is
ready
it
does
really
seem
to
mean
anything
at
all
but
that
is
because
you
are
not
used
to
bearer
english
you
will
presently
understand
where
he
gets
his
english
is
his
own
secret
there
is
nothing
like
it
elsewhere
in
the
earth
or
even
in
paradise
perhaps
but
the
other
place
is
probably
full
of
it
you
hire
him
as
soon
as
you
touch
indian
soil
for
no
matter
what
your
sex
is
you
can
not
do
without
him
he
is
messenger
valet
chambermaid
lady
maid
courier
he
is
everything
he
carries
a
coarse
linen
and
a
quilt
he
sleeps
on
the
stone
floor
outside
your
chamber
door
and
gets
his
meals
you
do
not
know
where
nor
when
you
only
know
that
he
is
not
fed
on
the
premises
either
when
you
are
in
a
hotel
or
when
you
are
a
guest
in
a
private
house
his
wages
are
large
from
an
indian
point
of
view
and
he
feeds
and
clothes
himself
out
of
them
we
had
three
of
him
in
two
and
a
half
months
the
first
one
rate
was
thirty
rupees
a
month
that
is
to
say
cents
a
day
the
rate
of
the
others
rs
rupees
a
month
a
princely
sum
for
the
native
switchman
on
a
railway
and
the
native
servant
in
a
private
family
get
only
rs
per
month
and
the
only
the
two
former
feed
and
clothe
themselves
and
their
families
on
their
per
month
but
i
can
not
believe
that
the
farmhand
has
to
feed
himself
on
his
i
think
the
farm
probably
feeds
him
and
that
the
whole
of
his
wages
except
a
trifle
for
the
priest
go
to
the
support
of
his
family
that
is
to
the
feeding
of
his
family
for
they
live
in
a
mud
hut
and
doubtless
and
they
wear
no
clothes
at
least
nothing
more
than
a
rag
and
not
much
of
a
rag
at
that
in
the
case
of
the
males
however
these
are
handsome
times
for
the
he
was
not
always
the
child
of
luxury
that
he
is
now
the
chief
commissioner
of
the
central
provinces
in
a
recent
official
utterance
wherein
he
was
rebuking
a
native
deputation
for
complaining
of
hard
times
reminded
them
that
they
could
easily
remember
when
a
wages
were
only
half
a
rupee
former
value
a
month
that
is
to
say
less
than
a
cent
a
day
nearly
a
year
if
such
a
had
a
good
deal
of
a
family
and
they
all
have
that
for
god
is
very
good
to
these
poor
natives
in
some
ways
he
would
save
a
profit
of
fifteen
cents
clean
and
clear
out
of
his
year
toil
i
mean
a
frugal
thrifty
person
would
not
one
given
to
display
and
ostentation
and
if
he
owed
and
took
good
care
of
his
health
he
could
pay
it
off
in
ninety
years
then
he
could
hold
up
his
head
and
look
his
creditors
in
the
face
again
think
of
these
facts
and
what
they
mean
india
does
not
consist
of
cities
there
are
no
cities
in
india
to
speak
of
its
stupendous
population
consists
of
india
is
one
vast
farm
one
almost
interminable
stretch
of
fields
with
mud
fences
between
think
of
the
above
facts
and
consider
what
an
incredible
aggregate
of
poverty
they
place
before
you
the
first
bearer
that
applied
waited
below
and
sent
up
his
recommendations
that
was
the
first
morning
in
bombay
we
read
them
over
carefully
cautiously
thoughtfully
there
was
not
a
fault
to
find
with
them
except
one
they
were
all
from
americans
is
that
a
slur
if
it
is
it
is
a
deserved
one
in
my
experience
an
recommendation
of
a
servant
is
not
usually
valuable
we
are
too
a
race
we
hate
to
say
the
unpleasant
thing
we
shrink
from
speaking
the
unkind
truth
about
a
poor
fellow
whose
bread
depends
upon
our
verdict
so
we
speak
of
his
good
points
only
thus
not
scrupling
to
tell
a
lie
a
silent
lie
for
in
not
mentioning
his
bad
ones
we
as
good
as
say
he
has
any
the
only
difference
that
i
know
of
between
a
silent
lie
and
a
spoken
one
is
that
the
silent
lie
is
a
less
respectable
one
than
the
other
and
it
can
deceive
whereas
the
other
ca
as
a
rule
we
not
only
tell
the
silent
lie
as
to
a
servant
faults
but
we
sin
in
another
way
we
overpraise
his
merits
for
when
it
comes
to
writing
recommendations
of
servants
we
are
a
nation
of
gushers
and
we
have
not
the
frenchman
excuse
in
france
you
must
give
the
departing
servant
a
good
recommendation
and
you
must
conceal
his
faults
you
have
no
choice
if
you
mention
his
faults
for
the
protection
of
the
next
candidate
for
his
services
he
can
sue
you
for
damages
and
the
court
will
award
them
too
and
moreover
the
judge
will
give
you
a
sharp
from
the
bench
for
trying
to
destroy
a
poor
character
and
rob
him
of
his
bread
i
do
not
state
this
on
my
own
authority
i
got
it
from
a
french
physician
of
fame
and
repute
a
man
who
was
born
in
paris
and
had
practiced
there
all
his
life
and
he
said
that
he
spoke
not
merely
from
common
knowledge
but
from
exasperating
personal
experience
as
i
was
saying
the
bearer
recommendations
were
all
from
american
tourists
and
peter
would
have
admitted
him
to
the
fields
of
the
blest
on
them
i
mean
if
he
is
as
unfamiliar
with
our
people
and
our
ways
as
i
suppose
he
is
according
to
these
recommendations
manuel
was
supreme
in
all
the
arts
connected
with
his
complex
trade
and
these
manifold
arts
were
mentioned
and
detail
his
english
was
spoken
of
in
terms
of
warm
admiration
admiration
verging
upon
rapture
i
took
pleased
note
of
that
and
hoped
that
some
of
it
might
be
true
we
had
to
have
some
one
right
away
so
the
family
went
down
stairs
and
took
him
a
week
on
trial
then
sent
him
up
to
me
and
departed
on
their
affairs
i
was
shut
up
in
my
quarters
with
a
bronchial
cough
and
glad
to
have
something
fresh
to
look
at
something
new
to
play
with
manuel
filled
the
bill
manuel
was
very
welcome
he
was
toward
fifty
years
old
tall
slender
with
a
slight
stoop
an
artificial
stoop
a
deferential
stoop
a
stoop
rigidified
by
long
habit
with
face
of
european
mould
short
hair
intensely
black
gentle
black
eyes
timid
black
eyes
indeed
complexion
very
dark
nearly
black
in
fact
face
he
was
bareheaded
and
barefooted
and
was
never
otherwise
while
his
week
with
us
lasted
his
clothing
was
european
cheap
flimsy
and
showed
much
wear
he
stood
before
me
and
inclined
his
head
and
body
in
the
pathetic
indian
way
touching
his
forehead
with
the
finger
ends
of
his
right
hand
in
salute
i
said
manuel
you
are
evidently
indian
but
you
seem
to
have
a
spanish
name
when
you
put
it
all
together
how
is
that
a
perplexed
look
gathered
in
his
face
it
was
plain
that
he
had
not
understood
but
he
did
let
on
he
spoke
back
placidly
name
manuel
yes
master
i
know
but
how
did
you
get
the
name
oh
yes
i
suppose
think
happen
so
father
same
name
not
mother
i
saw
that
i
must
simplify
my
language
and
spread
my
words
apart
if
i
would
be
understood
by
this
english
scholar
well
then
how
did
your
father
get
his
name
oh
he
brightening
a
little
he
christian
portygee
live
in
goa
i
born
goa
mother
not
portygee
mother
brahmin
coolin
brahmin
highest
caste
no
other
so
high
caste
i
brahmin
too
christian
too
same
like
father
christian
brahmin
master
salvation
army
all
this
haltingly
and
with
difficulty
then
he
had
an
inspiration
and
began
to
pour
out
a
flood
of
words
that
i
could
make
nothing
of
so
i
said
there
do
do
that
i
ca
understand
hindostani
not
hindostani
master
english
always
i
speaking
english
sometimes
when
i
talking
every
day
all
the
time
at
you
very
well
stick
to
that
that
is
intelligible
it
is
not
up
to
my
hopes
it
is
not
up
to
the
promise
of
the
recommendations
still
it
is
english
and
i
understand
it
do
elaborate
it
i
do
like
elaborations
when
they
are
crippled
by
uncertainty
of
touch
master
oh
never
mind
it
was
only
a
random
thought
i
did
expect
you
to
understand
it
how
did
you
get
your
english
is
it
an
acquirement
or
just
a
gift
of
god
after
some
hesitation
piously
yes
he
very
good
christian
god
very
good
hindoo
god
very
good
too
two
million
hindoo
god
one
christian
god
make
two
million
and
one
all
mine
two
million
and
one
god
i
got
a
plenty
sometime
i
pray
all
time
at
those
keep
it
up
go
all
time
every
day
give
something
at
shrine
all
good
for
me
make
me
better
man
good
for
me
good
for
my
family
dam
good
then
he
had
another
inspiration
and
went
rambling
off
into
fervent
confusions
and
incoherencies
and
i
had
to
stop
him
again
i
thought
we
had
talked
enough
so
i
told
him
to
go
to
the
bathroom
and
clean
it
up
and
remove
the
slops
this
to
get
rid
of
him
he
went
away
seeming
to
understand
and
got
out
some
of
my
clothes
and
began
to
brush
them
i
repeated
my
desire
several
times
simplifying
and
it
and
at
last
he
got
the
idea
then
he
went
away
and
put
a
coolie
at
the
work
and
explained
that
he
would
lose
caste
if
he
did
it
himself
it
would
be
pollution
by
the
law
of
his
caste
and
it
would
cost
him
a
deal
of
fuss
and
trouble
to
purify
himself
and
accomplish
his
rehabilitation
he
said
that
that
kind
of
work
was
strictly
forbidden
to
persons
of
caste
and
as
strictly
restricted
to
the
very
bottom
layer
of
hindoo
society
the
despised
the
toiler
the
laborer
he
was
right
and
apparently
the
poor
sudra
has
been
content
with
his
strange
lot
his
insulting
distinction
for
ages
and
ages
clear
back
to
the
beginning
of
things
so
to
speak
buckle
says
that
his
name
laborer
is
a
term
of
contempt
that
it
is
ordained
by
the
institutes
of
menu
that
if
a
sudra
sit
on
a
level
with
his
superior
he
shall
be
exiled
or
branded
without
going
into
particulars
i
will
remark
that
as
a
rule
they
wear
no
clothing
that
would
conceal
the
m
if
he
speak
contemptuously
of
his
superior
or
insult
him
he
shall
suffer
death
if
he
listen
to
the
reading
of
the
sacred
books
he
shall
have
burning
oil
poured
in
his
ears
if
he
memorize
passages
from
them
he
shall
be
killed
if
he
marry
his
daughter
to
a
brahmin
the
husband
shall
go
to
hell
for
defiling
himself
by
contact
with
a
woman
so
infinitely
his
inferior
and
that
it
is
forbidden
to
a
sudra
to
acquire
wealth
the
bulk
of
the
population
of
india
says
bucklet
population
is
the
sudras
the
workers
the
farmers
the
creators
of
wealth
manuel
was
a
failure
poor
old
fellow
his
age
was
against
him
he
was
desperately
slow
and
phenomenally
forgetful
when
he
went
three
blocks
on
an
errand
he
would
be
gone
two
hours
and
then
forget
what
it
was
he
went
for
when
he
packed
a
trunk
it
took
him
forever
and
the
contents
were
an
unimaginable
chaos
when
he
got
done
he
could
wait
satisfactorily
at
table
a
prime
defect
for
if
you
have
your
own
servant
in
an
indian
hotel
you
are
likely
to
have
a
slow
time
of
it
and
go
away
hungry
we
could
understand
his
english
he
understand
ours
and
when
we
found
that
he
could
understand
his
own
it
seemed
time
for
us
to
part
i
had
to
discharge
him
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
i
did
it
as
kindly
as
i
could
and
as
gently
we
must
part
said
i
but
i
hoped
we
should
meet
again
in
a
better
world
it
was
not
true
but
it
was
only
a
little
thing
to
say
and
saved
his
feelings
and
cost
me
nothing
but
now
that
he
was
gone
and
was
off
my
mind
and
heart
my
spirits
began
to
rise
at
once
and
i
was
soon
feeling
brisk
and
ready
to
go
out
and
have
adventures
then
his
successor
flitted
in
touched
his
forehead
and
began
to
fly
around
here
there
and
everywhere
on
his
velvet
feet
and
in
five
minutes
he
had
everything
in
the
room
and
bristol
fashion
as
the
sailors
say
and
was
standing
at
the
salute
waiting
for
orders
dear
me
what
a
rustler
he
was
after
the
slumbrous
way
of
manuel
poor
old
slug
all
my
heart
all
my
affection
all
my
admiration
went
out
spontaneously
to
this
frisky
little
forked
black
thing
this
compact
and
compressed
incarnation
of
energy
and
force
and
promptness
and
celerity
and
confidence
this
smart
smily
engaging
little
devil
feruled
on
his
upper
end
by
a
gleaming
of
a
fez
with
a
tassel
dangling
from
it
i
said
with
deep
satisfaction
you
suit
what
is
your
name
he
reeled
it
mellowly
off
let
me
see
if
i
can
make
a
selection
out
of
it
for
business
uses
i
mean
we
will
keep
the
rest
for
sundays
give
it
to
me
in
installments
he
did
it
but
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
short
ones
except
mousawhich
suggested
mouse
it
was
out
of
character
it
was
too
soft
too
quiet
too
conservative
it
did
fit
his
splendid
style
i
considered
and
said
mousa
is
short
enough
but
i
do
quite
like
it
it
seems
colorless
inharmonious
inadequate
and
i
am
sensitive
to
such
things
how
do
you
think
satan
would
do
yes
master
satan
do
wair
good
it
was
his
way
of
saying
very
good
there
was
a
rap
at
the
door
satan
covered
the
ground
with
a
single
skip
there
was
a
word
or
two
of
hindostani
then
he
disappeared
three
minutes
later
he
was
before
me
again
militarily
erect
and
waiting
for
me
to
speak
first
what
is
it
satan
god
want
to
see
you
who
god
i
show
him
up
master
why
this
is
so
unusual
that
that
well
you
see
indeed
i
am
so
unprepared
i
do
quite
know
what
i
do
mean
dear
me
ca
you
explain
do
you
see
that
this
is
a
most
ex
here
his
card
master
was
it
curious
and
amazing
and
tremendous
and
all
that
such
a
personage
going
around
calling
on
such
as
i
and
sending
up
his
card
like
a
mortal
sending
it
up
by
satan
it
was
a
bewildering
collision
of
the
impossibles
but
this
was
the
land
of
the
arabian
nights
this
was
india
and
what
is
it
that
can
not
happen
in
india
we
had
the
interview
satan
was
right
the
visitor
was
indeed
a
god
in
the
conviction
of
his
multitudinous
followers
and
was
worshiped
by
them
in
sincerity
and
humble
adoration
they
are
troubled
by
no
doubts
as
to
his
divine
origin
and
office
they
believe
in
him
they
pray
to
him
they
make
offerings
to
him
they
beg
of
him
remission
of
sins
to
them
his
person
together
with
everything
connected
with
it
is
sacred
from
his
barber
they
buy
the
parings
of
his
nails
and
set
them
in
gold
and
wear
them
as
precious
amulets
i
tried
to
seem
tranquilly
conversational
and
at
rest
but
i
was
not
would
you
have
been
i
was
in
a
suppressed
frenzy
of
excitement
and
curiosity
and
glad
wonder
i
could
not
keep
my
eyes
off
him
i
was
looking
upon
a
god
an
actual
god
a
recognized
and
accepted
god
and
every
detail
of
his
person
and
his
dress
had
a
consuming
interest
for
me
and
the
thought
went
floating
through
my
head
he
is
worshiped
think
of
it
he
is
not
a
recipient
of
the
pale
homage
called
compliment
wherewith
the
highest
human
clay
must
make
shift
to
be
satisfied
but
of
an
infinitely
richer
spiritual
food
adoration
worship
men
and
women
lay
their
cares
and
their
griefs
and
their
broken
hearts
at
his
feet
and
he
gives
them
his
peace
and
they
go
away
healed
and
just
then
the
awful
visitor
said
in
the
simplest
way
there
is
a
feature
of
the
philosophy
of
huck
finn
which
and
went
luminously
on
with
the
construction
of
a
compact
and
literary
verdict
it
is
a
land
of
surprises
india
i
had
had
my
ambitions
i
had
hoped
and
almost
expected
to
be
read
by
kings
and
presidents
and
emperors
but
i
had
never
looked
so
high
as
that
it
would
be
false
modesty
to
pretend
that
i
was
not
inordinately
pleased
i
was
i
was
much
more
pleased
than
i
should
have
been
with
a
compliment
from
a
man
he
remained
half
an
hour
and
i
found
him
a
most
courteous
and
charming
gentleman
the
godship
has
been
in
his
family
a
good
while
but
i
do
not
know
how
long
he
is
a
mohammedan
deity
by
earthly
rank
he
is
a
prince
not
an
indian
but
a
persian
prince
he
is
a
direct
descendant
of
the
prophet
line
he
is
comely
also
young
for
a
god
not
forty
perhaps
not
above
years
old
he
wears
his
immense
honors
with
tranquil
brace
and
with
a
dignity
proper
to
his
awful
calling
he
speaks
english
with
the
ease
and
purity
of
a
person
born
to
it
i
think
i
am
not
overstating
this
he
was
the
only
god
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
was
very
favorably
impressed
when
he
rose
to
say
the
door
swung
open
and
i
caught
the
flash
of
a
red
fez
and
heard
these
words
reverently
said
satan
see
god
out
yes
and
these
beings
passed
from
view
satan
in
the
lead
and
the
other
following
after
chapter
xl
few
of
us
can
stand
prosperity
another
man
i
mean
wilson
new
calendar
the
next
picture
in
my
mind
is
government
house
on
malabar
point
with
the
wide
from
the
windows
and
broad
balconies
abode
of
his
excellency
the
governor
of
the
bombay
presidency
a
residence
which
is
european
in
everything
but
the
native
guards
and
servants
and
is
a
home
and
a
palace
of
state
harmoniously
combined
that
was
england
the
english
power
the
english
civilization
the
modern
civilization
with
the
quiet
elegancies
and
quiet
colors
and
quiet
tastes
and
quiet
dignity
that
are
the
outcome
of
the
modern
cultivation
and
following
it
came
a
picture
of
the
ancient
civilization
of
india
an
hour
in
the
mansion
of
a
native
prince
kumar
schri
samatsinhji
bahadur
of
the
palitana
state
the
young
lad
his
heir
was
with
the
prince
also
the
lad
sister
a
wee
brown
sprite
very
pretty
very
serious
very
winning
delicately
moulded
costumed
like
the
daintiest
butterfly
a
dear
little
fairyland
princess
gravely
willing
to
be
friendly
with
the
strangers
but
in
the
beginning
preferring
to
hold
her
father
hand
until
she
could
take
stock
of
them
and
determine
how
far
they
were
to
be
trusted
she
must
have
been
eight
years
old
so
in
the
natural
indian
order
of
things
she
would
be
a
bride
in
three
or
four
years
from
now
and
then
this
free
contact
with
the
sun
and
the
air
and
the
other
belongings
of
nature
and
comradeship
with
visiting
male
folk
would
end
and
she
would
shut
herself
up
in
the
zenana
for
life
like
her
mother
and
by
inherited
habit
of
mind
would
be
happy
in
that
seclusion
and
not
look
upon
it
as
an
irksome
restraint
and
a
weary
captivity
the
game
which
the
prince
amuses
his
leisure
with
however
never
mind
it
i
should
never
be
able
to
describe
it
intelligibly
i
tried
to
get
an
idea
of
it
while
my
wife
and
daughter
visited
the
princess
in
the
zenana
a
lady
of
charming
graces
and
a
fluent
speaker
of
english
but
i
did
not
make
it
out
it
is
a
complicated
game
and
i
believe
it
is
said
that
nobody
can
learn
to
play
it
well
but
an
indian
and
i
was
not
able
to
learn
how
to
wind
a
turban
it
seemed
a
simple
art
and
easy
but
that
was
a
deception
it
is
a
piece
of
thin
delicate
stuff
a
foot
wide
or
more
and
forty
or
fifty
feet
long
and
the
exhibitor
of
the
art
takes
one
end
of
it
in
his
hands
and
winds
it
in
and
out
intricately
about
his
head
twisting
it
as
he
goes
and
in
a
minute
or
two
the
thing
is
finished
and
is
neat
and
symmetrical
and
fits
as
snugly
as
a
mould
we
were
interested
in
the
wardrobe
and
the
jewels
and
in
the
silverware
and
its
grace
of
shape
and
beauty
and
delicacy
of
ornamentation
the
silverware
is
kept
locked
up
except
at
and
none
but
the
chief
butler
and
the
prince
have
keys
to
the
safe
i
did
not
clearly
understand
why
but
it
was
not
for
the
protection
of
the
silver
it
was
either
to
protect
the
prince
from
the
contamination
which
his
caste
would
suffer
if
the
vessels
were
touched
by
hands
or
it
was
to
protect
his
highness
from
poison
possibly
it
was
both
i
believe
a
salaried
taster
has
to
taste
everything
before
the
prince
ventures
it
an
ancient
and
judicious
custom
in
the
east
and
has
thinned
out
the
tasters
a
good
deal
for
of
course
it
is
the
cook
that
puts
the
poison
in
if
i
were
an
indian
prince
i
would
not
go
to
the
expense
of
a
taster
i
would
eat
with
the
cook
ceremonials
are
always
interesting
and
i
noted
that
the
indian
is
a
ceremonial
whereas
ours
does
amount
to
that
in
salutation
the
son
reverently
touches
the
father
forehead
with
a
small
silver
implement
tipped
with
vermillion
paste
which
leaves
a
red
spot
there
and
in
return
the
son
receives
the
father
blessing
our
good
morning
is
well
enough
for
the
rowdy
west
perhaps
but
would
be
too
brusque
for
the
soft
and
ceremonious
east
after
being
properly
necklaced
according
to
custom
with
great
garlands
made
of
yellow
flowers
and
provided
with
to
chew
this
pleasant
visit
closed
and
we
passed
thence
to
a
scene
of
a
different
sort
from
this
glow
of
color
and
this
sunny
life
to
those
grim
receptacles
of
the
parsee
dead
the
towers
of
silence
there
is
something
stately
about
that
name
and
an
impressiveness
which
sinks
deep
the
hush
of
death
is
in
it
we
have
the
grave
the
tomb
the
mausoleum
god
acre
the
cemetery
and
association
has
made
them
eloquent
with
solemn
meaning
but
we
have
no
name
that
is
so
majestic
as
that
one
or
lingers
upon
the
ear
with
such
deep
and
haunting
pathos
on
lofty
ground
in
the
midst
of
a
paradise
of
tropical
foliage
and
flowers
remote
from
the
world
and
its
turmoil
and
noise
they
stood
the
towers
of
silence
and
away
below
was
spread
the
wide
groves
of
cocoa
palms
then
the
city
mile
on
mile
then
the
ocean
with
its
fleets
of
creeping
ships
all
steeped
in
a
stillness
as
deep
as
the
hush
that
hallowed
this
high
place
of
the
dead
the
vultures
were
there
they
stood
close
together
in
a
great
circle
all
around
the
rim
of
a
massive
low
tower
waiting
stood
as
motionless
as
sculptured
ornaments
and
indeed
almost
deceived
one
into
the
belief
that
that
was
what
they
were
presently
there
was
a
slight
stir
among
the
score
of
persons
present
and
all
moved
reverently
out
of
the
path
and
ceased
from
talking
a
funeral
procession
entered
the
great
gate
marching
two
and
two
and
moved
silently
by
toward
the
tower
the
corpse
lay
in
a
shallow
shell
and
was
under
cover
of
a
white
cloth
but
was
otherwise
naked
the
bearers
of
the
body
were
separated
by
an
interval
of
thirty
feet
from
the
mourners
they
and
also
the
mourners
were
draped
all
in
pure
white
and
each
couple
of
mourners
was
figuratively
bound
together
by
a
piece
of
white
rope
or
a
handkerchief
though
they
merely
held
the
ends
of
it
in
their
hands
behind
the
procession
followed
a
dog
which
was
led
in
a
leash
when
the
mourners
had
reached
the
neighborhood
of
the
tower
neither
they
nor
any
other
human
being
but
the
bearers
of
the
dead
must
approach
within
thirty
feet
of
it
they
turned
and
went
back
to
one
of
the
within
the
gates
to
pray
for
the
spirit
of
their
dead
the
bearers
unlocked
the
tower
sole
door
and
disappeared
from
view
within
in
a
little
while
they
came
out
bringing
the
bier
and
the
white
and
locked
the
door
again
then
the
ring
of
vultures
rose
flapping
their
wings
and
swooped
down
into
the
tower
to
devour
the
body
nothing
was
left
of
it
but
a
skeleton
when
they
again
a
few
minutes
afterward
the
principle
which
underlies
and
orders
everything
connected
with
a
parsee
funeral
is
purity
by
the
tenets
of
the
zoroastrian
religion
the
elements
earth
fire
and
water
are
sacred
and
must
not
be
contaminated
by
contact
with
a
dead
body
hence
corpses
must
not
be
burned
neither
must
they
be
buried
none
may
touch
the
dead
or
enter
the
towers
where
they
repose
except
certain
men
who
are
officially
appointed
for
that
purpose
they
receive
high
pay
but
theirs
is
a
dismal
life
for
they
must
live
apart
from
their
species
because
their
commerce
with
the
dead
defiles
them
and
any
who
should
associate
with
them
would
share
their
defilement
when
they
come
out
of
the
tower
the
clothes
they
are
wearing
are
exchanged
for
others
in
a
building
within
the
grounds
and
the
ones
which
they
have
taken
off
are
left
behind
for
they
are
contaminated
and
must
never
be
used
again
or
suffered
to
go
outside
the
grounds
these
bearers
come
to
every
funeral
in
new
garments
so
far
as
is
known
no
human
being
other
than
an
official
save
one
has
ever
entered
a
tower
of
silence
after
its
consecration
just
a
hundred
years
ago
a
european
rushed
in
behind
the
bearers
and
fed
his
brutal
curiosity
with
a
glimpse
of
the
forbidden
mysteries
of
the
place
this
shabby
savage
name
is
not
given
his
quality
is
also
concealed
these
two
details
taken
in
connection
with
the
fact
that
for
his
extraordinary
offense
the
only
punishment
he
got
from
the
east
india
company
government
was
a
solemn
official
reprimand
suggest
the
suspicion
that
he
was
a
european
of
consequence
the
same
public
document
which
contained
the
reprimand
gave
warning
that
future
offenders
of
his
sort
if
in
the
company
service
would
be
dismissed
and
if
merchants
suffer
revocation
of
license
and
exile
to
england
the
towers
are
not
tall
but
are
low
in
proportion
to
their
circumference
like
a
gasometer
if
you
should
fill
a
gasometer
half
way
up
with
solid
granite
masonry
then
drive
a
wide
and
deep
well
down
through
the
center
of
this
mass
of
masonry
you
would
have
the
idea
of
a
tower
of
silence
on
the
masonry
surrounding
the
well
the
bodies
lie
in
shallow
trenches
which
radiate
like
from
the
well
the
trenches
slant
toward
the
well
and
carry
into
it
the
rainfall
underground
drains
with
charcoal
filters
in
them
carry
off
this
water
from
the
bottom
of
the
well
when
a
skeleton
has
lain
in
the
tower
exposed
to
the
rain
and
the
flaming
sun
a
month
it
is
perfectly
dry
and
clean
then
the
same
bearers
that
brought
it
there
come
gloved
and
take
it
up
with
tongs
and
throw
it
into
the
well
there
it
turns
to
dust
it
is
never
seen
again
never
touched
again
in
the
world
other
peoples
separate
their
dead
and
preserve
and
continue
social
distinctions
in
the
grave
the
skeletons
of
kings
and
statesmen
and
generals
in
temples

to
skeletons
of
their
degree
and
the
skeletons
of
the
commonplace
and
the
poor
in
places
suited
to
their
meaner
estate
but
the
parsees
hold
that
all
men
rank
alike
in
death
all
are
humble
all
poor
all
destitute
in
sign
of
their
poverty
they
are
sent
to
their
grave
naked
in
sign
of
their
equality
the
bones
of
the
rich
the
poor
the
illustrious
and
the
obscure
are
flung
into
the
common
well
together
at
a
parsee
funeral
there
are
no
vehicles
all
concerned
must
walk
both
rich
and
poor
howsoever
great
the
distance
to
be
traversed
may
be
in
the
wells
of
the
five
towers
of
silence
is
mingled
the
dust
of
all
the
parsee
men
and
women
and
children
who
have
died
in
bombay
and
its
vicinity
during
the
two
centuries
which
have
elapsed
since
the
mohammedan
conquerors
drove
the
parsees
out
of
persia
and
into
that
region
of
india
the
earliest
of
the
five
towers
was
built
by
the
modi
family
something
more
than
years
ago
and
it
is
now
reserved
to
the
heirs
of
that
house
none
but
the
dead
of
that
blood
are
carried
thither
the
origin
of
at
least
one
of
the
details
of
a
parsee
funeral
is
not
now
known
the
presence
of
the
dog
before
a
corpse
is
borne
from
the
house
of
mourning
it
must
be
uncovered
and
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
a
dog
a
dog
must
also
be
led
in
the
rear
of
the
funeral
nusserwanjee
byranijee
secretary
to
the
parsee
punchayet
said
that
these
formalities
had
once
had
a
meaning
and
a
reason
for
their
institution
but
that
they
were
survivals
whose
origin
none
could
now
account
for
custom
and
tradition
continue
them
in
force
antiquity
hallows
them
it
is
thought
that
in
ancient
times
in
persia
the
dog
was
a
sacred
animal
and
could
guide
souls
to
heaven
also
that
his
eye
had
the
power
of
purifying
objects
which
had
been
contaminated
by
the
touch
of
the
dead
and
that
hence
his
presence
with
the
funeral
cortege
provides
an
remedy
in
case
of
need
the
parsees
claim
that
their
method
of
disposing
of
the
dead
is
an
effective
protection
of
the
living
that
it
disseminates
no
corruption
no
impurities
of
any
sort
no
that
no
wrap
no
garment
which
has
touched
the
dead
is
allowed
to
touch
the
living
afterward
that
from
the
towers
of
silence
nothing
proceeds
which
can
carry
harm
to
the
outside
world
these
are
just
claims
i
think
as
a
sanitary
measure
their
system
seems
to
be
about
the
equivalent
of
cremation
and
as
sure
we
are
drifting
slowly
but
hopefully
toward
cremation
in
these
days
it
could
not
be
expected
that
this
progress
should
be
swift
but
if
it
be
steady
and
continuous
even
if
slow
that
will
suffice
when
cremation
becomes
the
rule
we
shall
cease
to
shudder
at
it
we
should
shudder
at
burial
if
we
allowed
ourselves
to
think
what
goes
on
in
the
grave
the
dog
was
an
impressive
figure
to
me
representing
as
he
did
a
mystery
whose
key
is
lost
he
was
humble
and
apparently
depressed
and
he
let
his
head
droop
pensively
and
looked
as
if
he
might
be
trying
to
call
back
to
his
mind
what
it
was
that
he
had
used
to
symbolize
ages
ago
when
he
began
his
function
there
was
another
impressive
thing
close
at
hand
but
i
was
not
privileged
to
see
it
that
was
the
sacred
fire
a
fire
which
is
supposed
to
have
been
burning
without
interruption
for
more
than
two
centuries
and
so
living
by
the
same
heat
that
was
imparted
to
it
so
long
ago
the
parsees
are
a
remarkable
community
there
are
only
about
in
bombay
and
only
about
half
as
many
as
that
in
the
rest
of
india
but
they
make
up
in
importance
what
they
lack
in
numbers
they
are
highly
educated
energetic
enterprising
progressive
rich
and
the
jew
himself
is
not
more
lavish
or
catholic
in
his
charities
and
benevolences
the
parsees
build
and
endow
hospitals
for
both
men
and
animals
and
they
and
their
womenkind
keep
an
open
purse
for
all
great
and
good
objects
they
are
a
political
force
and
a
valued
support
to
the
government
they
have
a
pure
and
lofty
religion
and
they
preserve
it
in
its
integrity
and
order
their
lives
by
it
we
took
a
final
sweep
of
the
wonderful
view
of
plain
and
city
and
ocean
and
so
ended
our
visit
to
the
garden
and
the
towers
of
silence
and
the
last
thing
i
noticed
was
another
symbol
a
voluntary
symbol
this
one
it
was
a
vulture
standing
on
the
top
of
a
tall
and
slender
and
branchless
palm
in
an
open
space
in
the
ground
he
was
perfectly
motionless
and
looked
like
a
piece
of
sculpture
on
a
pillar
and
he
had
a
mortuary
look
too
which
was
in
keeping
with
the
place

wilson
new
calendar
the
next
picture
that
drifts
across
the
field
of
my
memory
is
one
which
is
connected
with
religious
things
we
were
taken
by
friends
to
see
a
jain
temple
it
was
small
and
had
many
flags
or
streamers
flying
from
poles
standing
above
its
roof
and
its
little
battlements
supported
a
great
many
small
idols
or
images
upstairs
inside
a
solitary
jain
was
praying
or
reciting
aloud
in
the
middle
of
the
room
our
presence
did
not
interrupt
him
nor
even
incommode
him
or
modify
his
fervor
ten
or
twelve
feet
in
front
of
him
was
the
idol
a
small
figure
in
a
sitting
posture
it
had
the
pinkish
look
of
a
wax
doll
but
lacked
the
roundness
of
limb
and
approximation
to
correctness
of
form
and
justness
of
proportion
gandhi
explained
every
thing
to
us
he
was
delegate
to
the
chicago
fair
congress
of
religions
it
was
lucidly
done
in
masterly
english
but
in
time
it
faded
from
me
and
now
i
have
nothing
left
of
that
episode
but
an
impression
a
dim
idea
of
a
religious
belief
clothed
in
subtle
intellectual
forms
lofty
and
clean
barren
of
fleshly
grossnesses
and
with
this
another
dim
impression
which
connects
that
intellectual
system
somehow
with
that
crude
image
that
inadequate
idol
how
i
do
not
know
properly
they
do
not
seem
to
belong
together
apparently
the
idol
symbolized
a
person
who
had
become
a
saint
or
a
god
through
accessions
of
steadily
augmenting
holiness
acquired
through
a
series
of
reincarnations
and
promotions
extending
over
many
ages
and
was
now
at
last
a
saint
and
qualified
to
vicariously
receive
worship
and
transmit
it
to
heaven
chancellery
was
that
it
and
thence
we
went
to
premchand
roychand
bungalow
in
lovelane
byculla
where
an
indian
prince
was
to
receive
a
deputation
of
the
jain
community
who
desired
to
congratulate
him
upon
a
high
honor
lately
conferred
upon
him
by
his
sovereign
victoria
empress
of
india
she
had
made
him
a
knight
of
the
order
of
the
star
of
india
it
would
seem
that
even
the
grandest
indian
prince
is
glad
to
add
the
modest
title
sir
to
his
ancient
native
grandeurs
and
is
willing
to
do
valuable
service
to
win
it
he
will
remit
taxes
liberally
and
will
spend
money
freely
upon
the
betterment
of
the
condition
of
his
subjects
if
there
is
a
knighthood
to
be
gotten
by
it
and
he
will
also
do
good
work
and
a
deal
of
it
to
get
a
gun
added
to
the
salute
allowed
him
by
the
british
government
every
year
the
empress
distributes
knighthoods
and
adds
guns
for
public
services
done
by
native
princes
the
salute
of
a
small
prince
is
three
or
four
guns
princes
of
greater
consequence
have
salutes
that
run
higher
and
higher
gun
by
gun
oh
clear
away
up
to
eleven
possibly
more
but
i
did
not
hear
of
any
above
princes
i
was
told
that
when
a
prince
gets
a
gun
added
he
is
pretty
troublesome
for
a
while
till
the
novelty
wears
off
for
he
likes
the
music
and
keeps
hunting
up
pretexts
to
get
himself
saluted
it
may
be
that
supremely
grand
folk
like
the
nyzam
of
hyderabad
and
the
gaikwar
of
baroda
have
more
than
eleven
guns
but
i
do
know
when
we
arrived
at
the
bungalow
the
large
hall
on
the
ground
floor
was
already
about
full
and
carriages
were
still
flowing
into
the
grounds
the
company
present
made
a
fine
show
an
exhibition
of
human
fireworks
so
to
speak
in
the
matters
of
costume
and
comminglings
of
brilliant
color
the
variety
of
form
noticeable
in
the
display
of
turbans
was
remarkable
we
were
told
that
the
explanation
of
this
was
that
this
jain
delegation
was
drawn
from
many
parts
of
india
and
that
each
man
wore
the
turban
that
was
in
vogue
in
his
own
region
this
diversity
of
turbans
made
a
beautiful
effect
i
could
have
wished
to
start
a
rival
exhibition
there
of
christian
hats
and
clothes
i
would
have
cleared
one
side
of
the
room
of
its
indian
splendors
and
repacked
the
space
with
christians
drawn
from
america
england
and
the
colonies
dressed
in
the
hats
and
habits
of
now
and
of
twenty
and
forty
and
fifty
years
ago
it
would
have
been
a
hideous
exhibition
a
thoroughly
devilish
spectacle
then
there
would
have
been
the
added
disadvantage
of
the
white
complexion
it
is
not
an
unbearably
unpleasant
complexion
when
it
keeps
to
itself
but
when
it
comes
into
competition
with
masses
of
brown
and
black
the
fact
is
betrayed
that
it
is
endurable
only
because
we
are
used
to
it
nearly
all
black
and
brown
skins
are
beautiful
but
a
beautiful
white
skin
is
rare
how
rare
one
may
learn
by
walking
down
a
street
in
paris
new
york
or
london
on
a
particularly
an
unfashionable
street
and
keeping
count
of
the
satisfactory
complexions
encountered
in
the
course
of
a
mile
where
dark
complexions
are
massed
they
make
the
whites
look
unwholesome
and
sometimes
frankly
ghastly
i
could
notice
this
as
a
boy
down
south
in
the
slavery
days
before
the
war
the
splendid
black
satin
skin
of
the
south
african
zulus
of
durban
seemed
to
me
to
come
very
close
to
perfection
i
can
see
those
zulus
yet
athletes
waiting
in
front
of
the
hotel
for
custom
handsome
and
intensely
black
creatures
moderately
clothed
in
loose
summer
stuffs
whose
snowy
whiteness
made
the
black
all
the
blacker
by
contrast
keeping
that
group
in
my
mind
i
can
compare
those
complexions
with
the
white
ones
which
are
streaming
past
this

some
of

signs
of

some
show

of

out
of

with
the
surrounding

the

complexion
makes
no
concealments
it
ca
it
seemed
to
have
been
designed
as
a
for
everything
that
can
damage
it
ladies
have
to
paint
it
and
powder
it
and
cosmetic
it
and
diet
it
with
arsenic
and
enamel
it
and
be
always
enticing
it
and
persuading
it
and
pestering
it
and
fussing
at
it
to
make
it
beautiful
and
they
do
not
succeed
but
these
efforts
show
what
they
think
of
the
natural
complexion
as
distributed
as
distributed
it
needs
these
helps
the
complexion
which
they
try
to
counterfeit
is
one
which
nature
restricts
to
the
few
to
the
very
few
to
persons
she

a
good
one
the

can
keep
it
how
long
ten
years
perhaps
the
advantage
is
with
the
zulu
i
think
he
starts
with
a
beautiful
complexion
and
it
will
last
him
through
and
as
for
the
indian
brown
firm
smooth
blemishless
pleasant
and
restful
to
the
eye
afraid
of
no
color
harmonizing
with
all
colors
and
adding
a
grace
to
them
all
i
think
there
is
no
sort
of
chance
for
the
average
white
complexion
against
that
rich
and
perfect
tint
to
return
to
the
bungalow
the
most
gorgeous
costume
present
were
worn
by
some
children
they
seemed
to
blaze
so
bright
were
the
colors
and
so
brilliant
the
jewels
strum
over
the
rich
materials
these
children
were
professional
and
looked
like
girls
but
they
were
boys
they
got
up
by
ones
and
twos
and
fours
and
danced
and
sang
to
an
accompaniment
of
weird
music
their
posturings
and
gesturings
were
elaborate
and
graceful
but
their
voices
were
stringently
raspy
and
unpleasant
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
monotony
about
the
tune
by
and
by
there
was
a
burst
of
shouts
and
cheers
outside
and
the
prince
with
his
train
entered
in
fine
dramatic
style
he
was
a
stately
man
he
was
ideally
costumed
and
fairly
festooned
with
ropes
of
gems
some
of
the
ropes
were
of
pearls
some
were
of
uncut
great
emeralds
emeralds
renowned
in
bombay
for
their
quality
and
value
their
size
was
marvelous
and
enticing
to
the
eye
those
rocks
a
boy
a
princeling
was
with
the
prince
and
he
also
was
a
radiant
exhibition
the
ceremonies
were
not
tedious
the
prince
strode
to
his
throne
with
the
port
and
majesty
and
the
sternness
of
a
julius
caesar
coming
to
receive
and
receipt
for
a
kingdom
and
have
it
over
and
get
out
and
no
fooling
there
was
a
throne
for
the
young
prince
too
and
the
two
sat
there
side
by
side
with
their
officers
grouped
at
either
hand
and
most
accurately
and
creditably
reproducing
the
pictures
which
one
sees
in
the
books
pictures
which
people
in
the
prince
line
of
business
have
been
furnishing
ever
since
solomon
received
the
queen
of
sheba
and
showed
her
his
things
the
chief
of
the
jain
delegation
read
his
paper
of
congratulations
then
pushed
it
into
a
beautifully
engraved
silver
cylinder
which
was
delivered
with
ceremony
into
the
hands
and
at
once
delivered
by
him
without
ceremony
into
the
hands
of
an
officer
i
will
copy
the
address
here
it
is
interesting
as
showing
what
an
indian
prince
subject
may
have
opportunity
to
thank
him
for
in
these
days
of
modern
english
rule
as
contrasted
with
what
his
ancestor
would
have
given
them
opportunity
to
thank
him
for
a
century
and
a
half
ago
the
days
of
freedom
unhampered
by
english
interference
a
century
and
a
half
ago
an
address
of
thanks
could
have
been
put
into
small
space
it
would
have
thanked
the
prince
for
not
slaughtering
too
many
of
his
people
upon
mere
caprice
for
not
stripping
them
bare
by
sudden
and
arbitrary
tax
levies
and
bringing
famine
upon
them
for
not
upon
empty
pretext
destroying
the
rich
and
seizing
their
property
for
not
killing
blinding
imprisoning
or
banishing
the
relatives
of
the
royal
house
to
protect
the
throne
from
possible
plots
for
not
betraying
the
subject
secretly
for
a
bribe
into
the
hands
of
bands
of
professional
thugs
to
be
murdered
and
robbed
in
the
prince
back
lot
those
were
rather
common
princely
industries
in
the
old
times
but
they
and
some
others
of
a
harsh
sort
ceased
long
ago
under
english
rule
better
industries
have
taken
their
place
as
this
address
from
the
jain
community
will
show
your
highness
we
the
undersigned
members
of
the
jain
community
of
bombay
have
the
pleasure
to
approach
your
highness
with
the
expression
of
our
heartfelt
congratulations
on
the
recent
conference
on
your
highness
of
the
knighthood
of
the
most
exalted
order
of
the
star
of
india
ten
years
ago
we
had
the
pleasure
and
privilege
of
welcoming
your
highness
to
this
city
under
circumstances
which
have
made
a
memorable
epoch
in
the
history
of
your
state
for
had
it
not
been
for
a
generous
and
reasonable
spirit
that
your
highness
displayed
in
the
negotiations
between
the
palitana
durbar
and
the
jain
community
the
conciliatory
spirit
that
animated
our
people
could
not
have
borne
fruit
that
was
the
first
step
in
your
highness
administration
and
it
fitly
elicited
the
praise
of
the
jain
community
and
of
the
bombay
government
a
decade
of
your
highness
administration
combined
with
the
abilities
training
and
acquirements
that
your
highness
brought
to
bear
upon
it
has
justly
earned
for
your
highness
the
unique
and
honourable
distinction
the
knighthood
of
the
most
exalted
order
of
the
star
of
india
which
we
understand
your
highness
is
the
first
to
enjoy
among
chiefs
of
your
highness
rank
and
standing
and
we
assure
your
highness
that
for
this
mark
of
honour
that
has
been
conferred
on
you
by
her
most
gracious
majesty
the
we
feel
no
less
proud
than
your
highness
establishment
of
commercial
factories
schools
hospitals
by
your
highness
in
your
state
has
marked
your
highness
career
during
these
ten
years
and
we
trust
that
your
highness
will
be
spared
to
rule
over
your
people
with
wisdom
and
foresight
and
foster
the
many
reforms
that
your
highness
has
been
pleased
to
introduce
in
your
state
we
again
offer
your
highness
our
warmest
felicitations
for
the
honour
that
has
been
conferred
on
you
we
beg
to
remain
your
highness
obedient

the
prince
propagates
that
kind
of
things
in
the
modern
times
and
gets
knighthood
and
guns
for
it
after
the
address
the
prince
responded
with
snap
and
brevity
spoke
a
moment
with
half
a
dozen
guests
in
english
and
with
an
official
or
two
in
a
native
tongue
then
the
garlands
were
distributed
as
usual
and
the
function
ended

new

toward
midnight
that
night
there
was
another
function
this
was
a
hindoo
wedding
no
i
think
it
was
a
betrothal
ceremony
always
before
we
had
driven
through
streets
that
were
multitudinous
and
tumultuous
with
picturesque
native
life
but
now
there
was
nothing
of
that
we
seemed
to
move
through
a
city
of
the
dead
there
was
hardly
a
suggestion
of
life
in
those
still
and
vacant
streets
even
the
crows
were
silent
but
everywhere
on
the
ground
lay
sleeping
and
hundreds
they
lay
stretched
at
full
length
and
tightly
wrapped
in
blankets
beads
and
all
their
attitude
and
their
rigidity
counterfeited
death
the
plague
was
not
in
bombay
then
but
it
is
devastating
the
city
now
the
shops
are
deserted
now
half
of
the
people
have
fled
and
of
the
remainder
the
smitten
perish
by
shoals
every
day
no
doubt
the
city
looks
now
in
the
daytime
as
it
looked
then
at
night
when
we
had
pierced
deep
into
the
native
quarter
and
were
threading
its
narrow
dim
lanes
we
had
to
go
carefully
for
men
were
stretched
asleep
all
about
and
there
was
hardly
room
to
drive
between
them
and
every
now
and
then
a
swarm
of
rats
would
scamper
across
past
the
horses
feet
in
the
vague
light
the
forbears
of
the
rats
that
are
carrying
the
plague
from
house
to
house
in
bombay
now
the
shops
were
but
sheds
little
booths
open
to
the
street
and
the
goods
had
been
removed
and
on
the
counters
families
were
sleeping
usually
with
an
oil
lamp
present
recurrent
dead
watches
it
looked
like
but
at
last
we
turned
a
corner
and
saw
a
great
glare
of
light
ahead
it
was
the
home
of
the
bride
wrapped
in
a
perfect
conflagration
of
illuminations
mainly
designs
gotten
up
specially
for
the
occasion
within
was
abundance
of
brilliancy
flames
costumes
colors
decorations
mirrors
it
was
another
aladdin
show
the
bride
was
a
trim
and
comely
little
thing
of
twelve
years
dressed
as
we
would
dress
a
boy
though
more
expensively
than
we
should
do
it
of
course
she
moved
about
very
much
at
her
ease
and
stopped
and
talked
with
the
guests
and
allowed
her
wedding
jewelry
to
be
examined
it
was
very
fine
particularly
a
rope
of
great
diamonds
a
lovely
thing
to
look
at
and
handle
it
had
a
great
emerald
hanging
to
it
the
bridegroom
was
not
present
he
was
having
betrothal
festivities
of
his
own
at
his
father
house
as
i
understood
it
he
and
the
bride
were
to
entertain
company
every
night
and
nearly
all
night
for
a
week
or
more
then
get
married
if
alive
both
of
the
children
were
a
little
elderly
as
brides
and
grooms
go
in
india
twelve
they
ought
to
have
been
married
a
year
or
two
sooner
still
to
a
stranger
twelve
seems
quite
young
enough
a
while
after
midnight
a
couple
of
celebrated
and
appeared
in
the
gorgeous
place
and
danced
and
sang
with
them
were
men
who
played
upon
strange
instruments
which
made
uncanny
noises
of
a
sort
to
make
one
flesh
creep
one
of
these
instruments
was
a
pipe
and
to
its
music
the
girls
went
through
a
performance
which
represented
snake
charming
it
seemed
a
doubtful
sort
of
music
to
charm
anything
with
but
a
native
gentleman
assured
me
that
snakes
like
it
and
will
come
out
of
their
holes
and
listen
to
it
with
every
evidence
of
refreshment
and
gratitude
he
said
that
at
an
entertainment
in
his
grounds
once
the
pipe
brought
out
half
a
dozen
snakes
and
the
music
had
to
be
stopped
before
they
would
be
persuaded
to
go
nobody
wanted
their
company
for
they
were
bold
familiar
and
dangerous
but
no
one
would
kill
them
of
course
for
it
is
sinful
for
a
hindoo
to
kill
any
kind
of
a
creature
we
withdrew
from
the
festivities
at
two
in
the
morning
another
picture
then
but
it
has
lodged
itself
in
my
memory
rather
as
a
than
as
a
reality
it
is
of
a
porch
and
short
flight
of
steps
crowded
with
dark
faces
and
draperies
flooded
with
the
strong
glare
from
the
dazzling
concentration
of
illuminations
and
midway
of
the
steps
one
conspicuous
figure
for
accent
a
turbaned
giant
with
a
name
according
to
his
size
rao
bahadur
baskirao
balinkanje
pitale
vakeel
to
his
highness
the
gaikwar
of
baroda
without
him
the
picture
would
not
have
been
complete
and
if
his
name
had
been
merely
smith
he
would
have
answered
close
at
hand
on
on
both
sides
of
the
narrow
street
were
illuminations
of
a
kind
commonly
employed
by
the
natives
scores
of
glass
tumblers
containing
tapers
fastened
a
few
in
inches
apart
all
over
great
latticed
frames
forming
starry
constellations
which
showed
out
vividly
against
their
black
back
grounds
as
we
drew
away
into
the
distance
down
the
dim
lanes
the
illuminations
gathered
together
into
a
single
mass
and
glowed
out
of
the
enveloping
darkness
like
a
sun
then
again
the
deep
silence
the
skurrying
rats
the
dim
forms
stretched
on
the
ground
and
on
either
hand
those
open
booths
counterfeiting
sepulchres
with
counterfeit
corpses
sleeping
motionless
in
the
flicker
of
the
counterfeit
death
lamps
and
now
a
year
later
when
i
read
the
cablegrams
i
seem
to
be
reading
of
what
i
myself
partly
saw
saw
before
it
happened
in
a
prophetic
dream
as
it
were
one
cablegram
says
business
in
the
native
town
is
about
suspended
except
the
wailing
and
the
tramp
of
the
funerals
there
is
but
little
life
or
movement
the
closed
shops
exceed
in
number
those
that
remain
open
another
says
that
of
the
people
have
fled
the
city
and
are
carrying
the
plague
to
the
country
three
days
later
comes
the
news
the
population
is
reduced
by
half
the
refugees
have
carried
the
disease
to
karachi
cases
deaths
a
day
or
two
later
fresh
cases
all
of
which
proved
fatal
the
plague
carries
with
it
a
terror
which
no
other
disease
can
excite
for
of
all
diseases
known
to
men
it
is
the
deadliest
by
far
the
deadliest
fresh
cases
all
fatal
it
is
the
black
death
alone
that
slays
like
that
we
can
all
imagine
after
a
fashion
the
desolation
of
a
city
and
the
stupor
of
stillness
broken
at
intervals
by
distant
bursts
of
wailing
marking
the
passing
of
funerals
here
and
there
and
yonder
but
i
suppose
it
is
not
possible
for
us
to
realize
to
ourselves
the
nightmare
of
dread
and
fear
that
possesses
the
living
who
are
present
in
such
a
place
and
can
not
get
away
that
half
million
fled
from
bombay
in
a
wild
panic
suggests
to
us
something
of
what
they
were
feeling
but
perhaps
not
even
they
could
realize
what
the
half
million
were
feeling
whom
they
left
stranded
behind
to
face
the
stalking
horror
without
chance
of
escape
kinglake
was
in
cairo
many
years
ago
during
an
epidemic
of
the
black
death
and
he
has
imagined
the
terrors
that
creep
into
a
man
heart
at
such
a
time
and
follow
him
until
they
themselves
breed
the
fatal
sign
in
the
armpit
and
then
the
delirium
with
confused
images
and
and
reeling
and
then
the
sudden
blank
of
death
to
the
contagionist
filled
as
he
is
with
the
dread
of
final
causes
having
no
faith
in
destiny
nor
in
the
fixed
will
of
god
and
with
none
of
the
indifference
which
might
stand
him
instead
of
creeds
to
such
one
every
rag
that
shivers
in
the
breeze
of
a
city
has
this
sort
of
sublimity
if
by
any
terrible
ordinance
he
be
forced
to
venture
forth
be
sees
death
dangling
from
every
sleeve
and
as
he
creeps
forward
he
poises
his
shuddering
limbs
between
the
imminent
jacket
that
is
stabbing
at
his
right
elbow
and
the
murderous
pelisse
that
threatens
to
mow
him
clean
down
as
it
sweeps
along
on
his
left
but
most
of
all
he
dreads
that
which
most
of
all
he
should
love
the
touch
of
a
dress
for
mothers
and
wives
hurrying
forth
on
kindly
errands
from
the
bedsides
of
the
dying
go
slouching
along
through
the
streets
more
willfully
and
less
courteously
than
the
men
for
a
while
it
may
be
that
the
caution
of
the
poor
levantine
may
enable
him
to
avoid
contact
but
sooner
or
later
perhaps
the
dreaded
chance
arrives
that
bundle
of
linen
with
the
dark
tearful
eyes
at
the
top
of
it
that
labors
along
with
the
voluptuous
clumsiness
of
grisi
she
has
touched
the
poor
levantine
with
the
hem
of
her
sleeve
from
that
dread
moment
his
peace
is
gone
his
mind
for
ever
hanging
upon
the
fatal
touch
invites
the
blow
which
he
fears
he
watches
for
the
symptoms
of
plague
so
carefully
that
sooner
or
later
they
come
in
truth
the
parched
mouth
is
a
sign
his
mouth
is
parched
the
throbbing
brain
his
brain
does
throb
the
rapid
pulse
he
touches
his
own
wrist
for
he
dares
not
ask
counsel
of
any
man
lest
he
be
deserted
he
touches
his
wrist
and
feels
how
his
frighted
blood
goes
galloping
out
of
his
heart
there
is
nothing
but
the
fatal
swelling
that
is
wanting
to
make
his
sad
conviction
complete
immediately
he
has
an
odd
feel
under
the
arm
no
pain
but
a
little
straining
of
the
skin
he
would
to
god
it
were
his
fancy
that
were
strong
enough
to
give
him
that
sensation
this
is
the
worst
of
all
it
now
seems
to
him
that
he
could
be
happy
and
contented
with
his
parched
mouth
and
his
throbbing
brain
and
his
rapid
pulse
if
only
he
could
know
that
there
were
no
swelling
under
the
left
arm
but
dares
he
try
in
a
moment
of
calmness
and
deliberation
he
dares
not
but
when
for
a
while
he
has
writhed
under
the
torture
of
suspense
a
sudden
strength
of
will
drives
him
to
seek
and
know
his
fate
he
touches
the
gland
and
finds
the
skin
sane
and
sound
but
under
the
cuticle
there
lies
a
small
lump
like
a
that
moves
as
he
pushes
it
oh
but
is
this
for
all
certainty
is
this
the
sentence
of
death
feel
the
gland
of
the
other
arm
there
is
not
the
same
lump
exactly
yet
something
a
little
like
it
have
not
some
people
glands
naturally
enlarged
would
to
heaven
he
were
one
so
he
does
for
himself
the
work
of
the
plague
and
when
the
angel
of
death
thus
courted
does
indeed
and
in
truth
come
he
has
only
to
finish
that
which
has
been
so
well
begun
he
passes
his
fiery
hand
over
the
brain
of
the
victim
and
lets
him
rave
for
a
season
but
all
of
people
and
things
once
dear
or
of
people
and
things
indifferent
once
more
the
poor
fellow
is
back
at
his
home
in
fair
provence
and
sees
the
sundial
that
stood
in
his
garden
sees
his
mother
and
the
forgotten
face
of
that
little
dear
sister
he
sees
her

says
on
a
sunday
morning
for
all
the
church
bells
are
ringing
he
looks
up
and
down
through
the
universe
and
owns
it
well
piled
with
bales
upon
bales
of
cotton
and
cotton
eternal
so
much
so
that
he
feels
he
knows
he
swears
he
could
make
that
winning
hazard
if
the
would
not
slant
upwards
and
if
the
cue
were
a
cue
worth
playing
with
but
it
is
not
it
a
cue
that
wo
move
his
own
arm
wo
move
in
short
there
the
devil
to
pay
in
the
brain
of
the

perhaps

next

wilson
new

one
day
during
our
stay
in
bombay
there
was
a
criminal
trial
of
a
most
interesting
sort
a
terribly
realistic
chapter
out
of
the
arabian
nights
a
strange
mixture
of
simplicities
and
pieties
and
murderous
practicalities
which
brought
back
the
forgotten
days
of
thuggee
and
made
them
live
again
in
fact
even
made
them
believable
it
was
a
case
where
a
young
girl
had
been
assassinated
for
the
sake
of
her
trifling
ornaments
things
not
worth
a
laborer
day
wages
in
america
this
thing
could
have
been
done
in
many
other
countries
but
hardly
with
the
cold
depravity
absence
of
fear
absence
of
caution
destitution
of
the
sense
of
horror
repentance
remorse
exhibited
in
this
case
elsewhere
the
murderer
would
have
done
his
crime
secretly
by
night
and
without
witnesses
his
fears
would
have
allowed
him
no
peace
while
the
dead
body
was
in
his
neighborhood
he
would
not
have
rested
until
he
had
gotten
it
safe
out
of
the
way
and
hidden
as
effectually
as
he
could
hide
it
but
this
indian
murderer
does
his
deed
in
the
full
light
of
day
cares
nothing
for
the
society
of
witnesses
is
in
no
way
incommoded
by
the
presence
of
the
corpse
takes
his
own
time
about
disposing
of
it
and
the
whole
party
are
so
indifferent
so
phlegmatic
that
they
take
their
regular
sleep
as
if
nothing
was
happening
and
no
halters
hanging
over
them
and
these

since
his
arrival
in

came
and
lived
with
us
when
i
returned
from

on
the
afternoon
of
that
day
i
saw
the
two
guests
seated
on
a
cot
in
the
veranda
and
a
few
minutes
after
the
accused
gopal
came
and
took
his
seat
by
their
side
while
i
and
my

were
seated
inside

my
mother
came
out
of

and
inquired
of
one
of
the
guests
ramji
what
had
happened
to
his
foot
when
he
replied
that
he
had
tried
many
remedies
but
they
had
done
him
no
good
my
mother
then
took
some
rice
in
her
hand
and
prophesied
that
the
disease
which
ramji
was
suffering
from
would
not
be
cured
until
he
returned
to
his
native
country
in
the
meantime
the
deceased
casi
came
from
the
direction
of
an
and
stood
in
front
on
the
threshold
of
our
room
with
a
in
her
hand

then
told
his
two
guests
to
leave

they
then
went
up
the
steps
towards
the
quarry
after
the
guests
had
gone
away
tookaram
seized
the
deceased
who
had
come
into
the
room
and
he
afterwards
put
a
waistband
around
her
and
tied
her
to
a
post
which
supports
a
loft
after
doing
this
he
pressed
the
throat
and
having
tied
her
mouth
with
the
now
shown
in
court
fastened
it
to
the
post
having
killed
the
girl
tookaram
removed
her
gold
head
ornament
and
a
gold
and
also
took
charge
of
her
besides
these
two
ornaments
cassi

on
her
person

tried
to
remove
the
silver
amulets

and
the
but
he
failed
in
his
attempt
while
he
was
doing
so
i
my
mother
and
gopal
were
present
after
removing
the
two
gold
ornaments
he
handed
them
over
to
gopal
who
was
at
the
time
standing
near
me
when
he
killed
cassi
tookaram
threatened
to
strangle
me
also
if
i
informed
any
one
of
this
gopal
and
myself
were
then
standing
at
the
door
of
our
room
and
we
both
were
threatened
by
tookaram
my
mother
baya
had
seized
the
legs
of
the
deceased
at
the
time
she
was
killed
and
whilst
she
was
being
tied
to
the
post
cassi
then
made
a
noise
tookaram
and
my
mother
took
part
in
killing
the
girl
after
the
murder
her
body
was
wrapped
up
in
a
mattress
and
kept
on
the
loft
over
the
door
of
our
room
when
cassi
was
strangled
the
door
of
the
room
was
fastened
from
the
inside
by
tookaram
this
deed
was
committed
shortly
after
my
return
home
from
work
in
the
mill
tookaram
put
the
body
of
the
deceased
in
the
mattress
and
after
it

went
to
have
his
head
shaved
by
a
barber
named
sambhoo
raghoo
who
lives
only
one
door
away
from
me
my
mother
and
myself
then
remained
in
the
possession
of
the
information
i
was
slapped
and
threatened
by
my
paramour
tookaram
and
that
was
the
only
reason
why
i
did
not
inform
any
one
at
that
time
when
i
told
tookaram
that
i
would
give
information
of
the
occurrence
he
slapped
me
the
accused
gopal
was
asked
by
tookaram
to
go
back
to
his
room
and
he
did
so
taking
away
with
him
the
two
gold
ornaments
and
the
yesso
mahadhoo
a
of
tookaram
came
to
the
house
and
asked
taokaram
why
he
was
washing
the
being
just
opposite
tookaram
replied
that
he
was
washing
his
dhotur
as
a
fowl
had
polluted
it
about
of
the
evening
of
that
day
my
mother
gave
me
three
pice
and
asked
me
to
buy
a
cocoanut
and
i
gave
the
money
to
yessoo
who
went
and
fetched
a
cocoanut
and
some
betel
leaves
when
yessoo
and
others
were
in
the
room
i
was
bathing
and
after
i
finished
my
bath
my
mother
took
the
cocoanut
and
the
betel
leaves
from
yessoo
and
we
five
went
to
the
sea
the
party
consisted
of
tookaram
my
mother
yessoo
tookaram
younger
brother
and
myself
on
reaching
the
seashore
my
mother
made
the
offering
to
the
sea
and
prayed
to
be
pardoned
for
what
we
had
done
before
we
went
to
the
sea
some
one
came
to
inquire
after
the
girl
cassi
the
police
and
other
people
came
to
make
these
inquiries
both
before
and
after
we
left
the
house
for
the
seashore
the
police
questioned
my
mother
about
the
girl
and
she
replied
that
cassi
had
come
to
her
door
but
had
left
the
next
day
the
police
questioned
tookaram
and
he
too
gave
a
similar
reply
this
was
said
the
same
night
when
the
search
was
made
for
the
girl
after
the
offering
was
made
to
the
sea
we
partook
of
the
cocoanut
and
returned
home
when
my
mother
gave
me
some
food
but
tookaram
did
not
partake
of
any
food
that
night
after
dinner
i
and
my
mother
slept
inside
the
room
and
tookaram
slept
on
a
cot
near
his
yessoo
mahadhoo
just
outside
the
door
that
was
not
the
usual
place
where
tookaram
slept
he
usually
slept
inside
the
room
the
body
of
the
deceased
remained
on
the
loft
when
i
went
to
sleep
the
room
in
which
we
slept
was
locked
and
i
heard
that
my
paramour
tookaram
was
restless
outside
about
the
following
morning
tookaram
knocked
at
the
door
when
both
myself
and
my
mother
opened
it
he
then
told
me
to
go
to
the
steps
leading
to
the
quarry
and
see
if
any
one
was
about
those
steps
lead
to
a
stable
through
which
we
go
to
the
quarry
at
the
back
of
the
compound
when
i
got
to
the
steps
i
saw
no
one
there
tookaram
asked
me
if
any
one
was
there
and
i
replied
that
i
could
see
no
one
about
he
then
took
the
body
of
the
deceased
from
the
loft
and
having
wrapped
it
up
in
his
saree
asked
me
to
accompany
him
to
the
steps
of
the
quarry
and
i
did
so
the
now
produced
here
was
the
same
besides
the
there
was
also
a
on
the
body
he
then
carried
the
body
in
his
arms
and
went
up
the
steps
through
the
stable
and
then
to
the
right
hand
towards
a
bungalow
where
tookaram
placed
the
body
near
a
wall
all
the
time
i
and
my
mother
were
with
him
when
the
body
was
taken
down
yessoo
was
lying
on
the
cot
after
depositing
the
body
under
the
wall
we
all
returned
home
and
soon
after
the
police
again
came
and
took
tookaram
away
about
an
hour
after
they
returned
and
took
me
and
my
mother
away
we
were
questioned
about
it
when
i
made
a
statement
two
hours
later
i
was
taken
to
the
room
and
i
pointed
out
this
waistband
the
the
mattress
and
the
wooden
post
to
superintendent
nolan
and
inspectors
roberts
and
rashanali
in
the
presence
of
my
mother
and
tookaram
tookaram
killed
the
girl
cassi
for
her
ornaments
which
he
wanted
for
the
girl
to
whom
he
was
shortly
going
to
be
married
the
body
was
found
in
the
same
place
where
it
was
deposited
by
tookaram
the
criminal
side
of
the
native
has
always
been
picturesque
always
readable
the
thuggee
and
one
or
two
other
particularly
outrageous
features
of
it
have
been
suppressed
by
the
english
but
there
is
enough
of
it
left
to
keep
it
darkly
interesting
one
finds
evidence
of
these
survivals
in
the
newspapers
macaulay
has
a
passage
upon
this
matter
in
his
great
historical
sketch
of
warren
hastings
where
he
is
describing
some
effects
which
followed
the
temporary
paralysis
of
hastings
powerful
government
brought
about
by
sir
philip
francis
and
his
party
the
natives
considered
hastings
as
a
fallen
man
and
they
acted
after
their
kind
some
of
our
readers
may
have
seen
in
india
a
cloud
of
crows
pecking
a
sick
vulture
to
death
no
bad
type
of
what
happens
in
that
country
as
often
as
fortune
deserts
one
who
has
been
great
and
dreaded
in
an
instant
all
the
sycophants
who
had
lately
been
ready
to
lie
for
him
to
forge
for
him
to
pander
for
him
to
poison
for
him
hasten
to
purchase
the
favor
of
his
victorious
enemies
by
accusing
him
an
indian
government
has
only
to
let
it
be
understood
that
it
wishes
a
particular
man
to
be
ruined
and
in
hours
it
will
be
furnished
with
grave
charges
supported
by
depositions
so
full
and
circumstantial
that
any
person
unaccustomed
to
asiatic
mendacity
would
regard
them
as
decisive
it
is
well
if
the
signature
of
the
destined
victim
is
not
counterfeited
at
the
foot
of
some
illegal
compact
and
if
some
treasonable
paper
is
not
slipped
into
a
in
his
house
that
was
nearly
a
century
and
a
quarter
ago
an
article
in
one
of
the
chief
journals
of
india
the
pioneer
shows
that
in
some
respects
the
native
of
is
just
what
his
ancestor
was
then
here
are
niceties
of
so
subtle
and
delicate
a
sort
that
they
lift
their
breed
of
rascality
to
a
place
among
the
fine
arts
and
almost
entitle
it
to
respect
the
records
of
the
indian
courts
might
certainly
be
relied
upon
to
prove
that
swindlers
as
a
class
in
the
east
come
very
close
to
if
they
do
not
surpass
in
brilliancy
of
execution
and
originality
of
design
the
most
expert
of
their
fraternity
in
europe
and
america
india
in
especial
is
the
home
of
forgery
there
are
some
particular
districts
which
are
noted
as
marts
for
the
finest
specimens
of
the
forger
handiwork
the
business
is
carried
on
by
firms
who
possess
stores
of
stamped
papers
to
suit
every
emergency
they
habitually
lay
in
a
store
of
fresh
stamped
papers
every
year
and
some
of
the
older
and
more
thriving
houses
can
supply
documents
for
the
past
forty
years
bearing
the
proper
and
possessing
the
genuine
appearance
of
age
other
districts
have
earned
notoriety
for
skilled
perjury
a
that
excites
a
respectful
admiration
when
one
thinks
of
the
universal
prevalence
of
the
art
and
persons
desirous
of
succeeding
in
false
suits
are
ready
to
pay
handsomely
to
avail
themselves
of
the
services
of
these
local
experts
as
witnesses
various
instances
illustrative
of
the
methods
of
these
swindlers
are
given
they
exhibit
deep
cunning
and
total
depravity
on
the
part
of
the
swindler
and
his
pals
and
more
obtuseness
on
the
part
of
the
victim
than
one
would
expect
to
find
in
a
country
where
suspicion
of
your
neighbor
must
surely
be
one
of
the
earliest
things
learned
the
favorite
subject
is
the
young
fool
who
has
just
come
into
a
fortune
and
is
trying
to
see
how
poor
a
use
he
can
put
it
to
i
will
quote
one
example
sometimes
another
form
of
confidence
trick
is
adopted
which
is
invariably
successful
the
particular
pigeon
is
spotted
and
his
acquaintance
having
been
made
he
is
encouraged
in
every
form
of
vice
when
the
friendship
is
thoroughly
established
the
swindler
remarks
to
the
young
man
that
he
has
a
brother
who
has
asked
him
to
lend
him
the
swindler
says
he
has
the
money
and
would
lend
it
but
as
the
borrower
is
his
brother
he
can
not
charge
interest
so
he
proposes
that
he
should
hand
the
dupe
the
money
and
the
latter
should
lend
it
to
the
swindler
brother
exacting
a
heavy
of
interest
which
it
is
pointed
out
they
may
equally
enjoy
in
dissipation
the
dupe
sees
no
objection
and
on
the
appointed
day
receives
from
the
swindler
which
he
hands
over
to
the
confederate
the
latter
is
profuse
in
his
thanks
and
executes
a
promissory
note
for
payable
to
bearer
the
swindler
allows
the
scheme
to
remain
quiescent
for
a
time
and
then
suggests
that
as
the
money
has
not
been
repaid
and
as
it
would
be
unpleasant
to
sue
his
brother
it
would
be
better
to
sell
the
note
in
the
bazaar
the
dupe
hands
the
note
over
for
the
money
he
advanced
was
not
his
and
on
being
informed
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
his
signature
on
the
back
so
as
to
render
the
security
negotiable
he
signs
without
any
hesitation
the
swindler
passes
it
on
to
confederates
and
the
latter
employ
a
respectable
firm
of
solicitors
to
ask
the
dupe
if
his
signature
is
genuine
he
admits
it
at
once
and
his
fate
is
sealed
a
suit
is
filed
by
a
confederate
against
the
dupe
two
accomplices
being
made
they
admit
their
signatures
as
indorsers
and
the
one
swears
he
bought
the
note
for
value
from
the
dupe
the
latter
has
no
defense
for
no
court
would
believe
the
apparently
idle
explanation
of
the
manner
in
which
he
came
to
endorse
the
note
there
is
only
one
india
it
is
the
only
country
that
has
a
monopoly
of
grand
and
imposing
specialties
when
another
country
has
a
remarkable
thing
it
can
not
have
it
all
to
itself
some
other
country
has
a
duplicate
but
india
that
is
different
its
marvels
are
its
own

can
not
be
infringed
imitations
are

magnitude
that
the
of
the
rest
of
the
world
are
but
modest
little
things
by
comparison
palaces
that
are
wonders
for
rarity
of
materials
delicacy
and
beauty
of
workmanship
and
for
cost
and
one
tomb
which
men
go
around
the
globe
to
see
it
takes
eighty
nations
speaking
eighty
languages
to
people
her
and
they
number
three
hundred
millions
on
top
of
all
this
she
is
the
mother
and
home
of
that
wonder
of
wonders
caste
and
of
that
mystery
of
mysteries
the
satanic
brotherhood
of
the
thugs
india
had
the
start
of
the
whole
world
in
the
beginning
of
things
she
had
the
first
civilization
she
had
the
first
accumulation
of
material
wealth
she
was
populous
with
deep
thinkers
and
subtle
intellects
she
had
mines
and
woods
and
a
fruitful
soil
it
would
seem
as
if
she
should
have
kept
the
lead
and
should
be
not
the
meek
dependent
of
an
alien
master
but
mistress
of
the
world
and
delivering
law
and
command
to
every
tribe
and
nation
in
it
but
in
truth
there
was
never
any
possibility
of
such
supremacy
for
her
if
there
had
been
but
one
india
and
one
language
but
there
were
eighty
of
them
where
there
are
eighty
nations
and
several
hundred
governments
fighting
and
quarreling
must
be
the
common
business
of
life
unity
of
purpose
and
policy
are
impossible
out
of
such
elements
supremacy
in
the
world
can
not
come
even
caste
itself
could
have
had
the
defeating
effect
of
a
multiplicity
of
tongues
no
doubt
for
it
separates
a
people
into
layers
and
layers
and
still
other
layers
that
have
no
community
of
feeling
with
each
other
and
in
such
a
condition
of
things
as
that
patriotism
can
have
no
healthy
growth
it
was
the
division
of
the
country
into
so
many
states
and
nations
that
made
thuggee
possible
and
prosperous
it
is
difficult
to
realize
the
situation
but
perhaps
one
may
approximate
it
by
imagining
the
states
of
our
union
peopled
by
separate
nations
speaking
separate
languages
with
guards
and
strung
along
all
frontiers
plenty
of
interruptions
for
travelers
and
traders
interpreters
able
to
handle
all
the
languages
very
rare
or
and
a
few
wars
always
going
on
here
and
there
and
yonder
as
a
further
embarrassment
to
commerce
and
excursioning
it
would
make
intercommunication
in
a
measure
ungeneral
india
had
eighty
languages
and
more
than
cats
no
clever
man
with
the
instinct
of
a
highway
robber
could
fail
to
notice
what
a
chance
for
business
was
here
offered
india
was
full
of
clever
men
with
the
highwayman
instinct
and
so
quite
naturally
the
brotherhood
of
the
thugs
came
into
being
to
meet
the
want
how
long
ago
that
was
nobody
it
is
supposed
one
of
the
chiefest
wonders
connected
with
it
was
the
success
with
which
it
kept
its
secret
the
english
trader
did
business
in
india
two
hundred
years
and
more
before
he
ever
heard
of
it
and
yet
it
was
assassinating
its
thousands
all
around
him
every
year
the
whole
time
chapter

the
old
saw
says
let
a
sleeping
dog
lie
right
still
when
there
is
much
at
stake
it
is
better
to
get
a
newspaper
to
do
it
wilson
new
calendar
from
diary
january
i
learned
of
an
official
the
other
day
i
was
not
aware
before
that
there
was
such
a
thing
i
am
allowed
the
temporary
use
of
it
we
are
making
preparations
for
travel
mainly
the
preparations
are
purchases
of
bedding
this
is
to
be
used
in
sleeping
berths
in
the
trains
in
private
houses
sometimes
and
in
of
the
hotels
it
is
not
realizable
and
yet
it
is
true
it
is
a
survival
an
apparently
unnecessary
thing
which
in
some
strange
way
has
outlived
the
conditions
which
once
made
it
necessary
it
comes
down
from
a
time
when
the
railway
and
the
hotel
did
not
exist
when
the
occasional
white
traveler
went
horseback
or
by
and
stopped
over
night
in
the
small
provided
at
easy
distances
by
the
government
a
shelter
merely
and
nothing
more
he
had
to
carry
bedding
along
or
do
without
the
dwellings
of
the
english
residents
are
spacious
and
comfortable
and
commodiously
furnished
and
surely
it
must
be
an
odd
sight
to
see
half
a
dozen
guests
come
filing
into
such
a
place
and
dumping
blankets
and
pillows
here
and
there
and
everywhere
but
custom
makes
incongruous
things
congruous
one
buys
the
bedding
with
waterproof
for
it
at
almost
any
shop
there
is
no
difficulty
about
it
january
what
a
spectacle
the
railway
station
was
at
it
was
a
very
large
station
yet
when
we
arrived
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
world
was
present
half
of
it
inside
the
other
half
outside
and
both
halves
bearing
mountainous
of
bedding
and
other
freight
trying
simultaneously
to
pass
each
other
in
opposing
floods
in
one
narrow
door
these
opposing
floods
were
patient
gentle
natives
with
whites
scattered
among
them
at
rare
intervals
and
wherever
a
white
man
native
servant
appeared
that
native
seemed
to
have
put
aside
his
natural
gentleness
for
the
time
and
invested
himself
with
the
white
man
privilege
of
making
a
way
for
himself
by
promptly
shoving
all
intervening
black
things
out
of
it
in
these
exhibitions
of
authority
satan
was
scandalous
he
was
probably
a
thug
in
one
of
his
former
incarnations
inside
the
great
station
tides
upon
tides
of
natives
swept
along
this
way
and
that
in
massed
and
bewildering
confusion
eager
anxious
belated
distressed
and
washed
up
to
the
long
trains
and
flowed
into
them
with
their
packs
and
bundles
and
disappeared
followed
at
once
by
the
next
wash
the
next
wave
and
here
and
there
in
the
midst
of
this
and
seemingly
undisturbed
by
it
sat
great
groups
of
natives
on
the
bare
stone
floor
young
slender
brown
women
old
gray
wrinkled
women
little
soft
brown
babies
old
men
young
men
boys
all
poor
people
but
all
the
females
among
them
both
big
and
little
bejeweled
with
cheap
and
showy
leglets
and
armlets
these
things
constituting
all
their
wealth
no
doubt
these
silent
crowds
sat
there
with
their
humble
bundles
and
baskets
and
small
household
gear
about
them
and
patiently
waited
for
what
a
train
that
was
to
start
at
some
time
or
other
during
the
day
or
night
they
timed
themselves
well
but
that
was
no
matter
the
thing
had
been
so
ordered
from
on
high
therefore
why
worry
there
was
plenty
of
time
hours
and
hours
of
it
and
the
thing
that
was
to
happen
would
happen
there
was
no
hurrying
it
the
natives
traveled
third
class
and
at
marvelously
cheap
rates
they
were
packed
and
crammed
into
cars
that
held
each
about
fifty
and
it
was
said
that
often
a
brahmin
of
the
highest
caste
was
thus
brought
into
personal
touch
and
consequent
defilement
with
persons
of
the
lowest
castes
no
doubt
a
very
shocking
thing
if
a
body
could
understand
it
and
properly
appreciate
it
yes
a
brahmin
who
did
own
a
rupee
and
could
borrow
one
might
have
to
touch
elbows
with
a
rich
hereditary
lord
of
inferior
caste
inheritor
of
an
ancient
title
a
couple
of
yards
long
and
he
would
just
have
to
stand
it
for
if
either
of
the
two
was
allowed
to
go
in
the
cars
where
the
sacred
white
people
were
it
probably
would
be
the
august
poor
brahmin
there
was
an
immense
string
of
those
cars
for
the
natives
travel
by
hordes
and
a
weary
hard
night
of
it
the
occupants
would
have
no
doubt
when
we
reached
our
car
satan
and
barney
had
already
arrived
there
with
their
train
of
porters
carrying
bedding
and
parasols
and
cigar
boxes
and
were
at
work
we
named
him
barney
for
short
we
could
use
his
real
name
there
was
time
it
was
a
car
that
promised
comfort
indeed
luxury
yet
the
cost
of
it
well
economy
could
no
further
go
even
in
france
not
even
in
italy
it
was
built
of
the
plainest
and
cheapest
boards
with
a
coating
of
dull
paint
on
them
and
there
was
nowhere
a
thought
of
decoration
the
floor
was
bare
but
would
not
long
remain
so
when
the
dust
should
begin
to
fly
across
one
end
of
the
compartment
ran
a
netting
for
the
accommodation
of
at
the
other
end
was
a
door
which
would
shut
upon
compulsion
but
would
stay
shut
it
opened
into
a
narrow
little
closet
which
had
a
in
one
end
of
it
and
a
place
to
put
a
towel
in
case
you
had
one
with
you
and
you
would
be
sure
to
have
towels
because
you
buy
them
with
the
bedding
knowing
that
the
railway
does
furnish
them
on
each
side
of
the
car
and
running
fore
and
aft
was
a
broad
sofa
to
sit
on
in
the
day
and
sleep
on
at
night
over
each
sofa
hung
by
straps
a
wide
flat
shelf
to
sleep
on
in
the
daytime
you
can
hitch
it
up
against
the
wall
out
of
the
way
and
then
you
have
a
big
unencumbered
and
most
comfortable
room
to
spread
out
in
no
car
in
any
country
is
quite
its
equal
for
comfort
and
privacy
i
think
for
usually
there
are
but
two
persons
in
it
and
even
when
there
are
four
there
is
but
little
sense
of
impaired
privacy
our
own
cars
at
home
can
surpass
the
railway
world
in
all
details
but
that
one
they
have
no
cosiness
there
are
too
many
people
together
at
the
foot
of
each
sofa
was
a
for
entrance
and
exit
along
the
whole
length
of
the
sofa
on
each
side
of
the
car
ran
a
row
of
large
windows
of
a
blue
to
soften
the
bitter
glare
of
the
sun
and
protect
one
eyes
from
torture
these
could
be
let
down
out
of
the
way
when
one
wanted
the
breeze
in
the
roof
were
two
oil
lamps
which
gave
a
light
strong
enough
to
read
by
each
had
a
attachment
by
which
it
could
be
covered
when
the
light
should
be
no
longer
needed
while
we
talked
outside
with
friends
barney
and
satan
placed
the
books
fruits
and
in
the
racks
and
the
and
heavy
baggage
in
the
closet
hung
the
overcoats
and
and
towels
on
the
hooks
hoisted
the
two
up
out
of
the
way
then
shouldered
their
bedding
and
retired
to
the
third
class
now
then
you
see
what
a
handsome
spacious
light
airy
homelike
place
it
was
wherein
to
walk
up
and
down
or
sit
and
write
or
stretch
out
and
read
and
smoke
a
central
door
in
the
forward
end
of
the
compartment
opened
into
a
similar
compartment
it
was
occupied
by
my
wife
and
daughter
about
nine
in
the
evening
while
we
halted
a
while
at
a
station
barney
and
satan
came
and
undid
the
clumsy
big
and
spread
the
bedding
on
the
sofas
in
both
compartments
mattresses
sheets
gay
coverlets
pillows
all
complete
there
are
no
chambermaids
in
india
apparently
it
was
an
office
that
was
never
heard
of
then
they
closed
the
communicating
door
nimbly
tidied
up
our
place
put
the
on
the
beds
and
the
slippers
under
them
then
returned
to
their
own
quarters
january
it
was
novel
and
pleasant
and
i
stayed
awake
as
long
as
i
could
to
enjoy
it
and
to
read
about
those
strange
people
the
thugs
in
my
sleep
they
remained
with
me
and
tried
to
strangle
me
the
leader
of
the
gang
was
that
giant
hindoo
who
was
such
a
picture
in
the
strong
light
when
we
were
leaving
those
hindoo
betrothal
festivities
at
two
in
the
morning
rao
bahadur

pitale
vakeel
to
the

of

it
was
he
that
brought
me
the
invitation
from
his
master
to
go
to
baroda
and
lecture
to
that
prince
and
now
he
was
misbehaving
in
my
dreams
but
all
things
can
happen
in
dreams
it
is
indeed
as
the
sweet
singer
of
michigan
says
irrelevantly
of
course
for
the
one
and
unfailing
great
quality
which
distinguishes
her
poetry
from
shakespeare
and
makes
it
precious
to
us
is
its
stern
and
simple
irrelevancy
my
heart
was
gay
and
happy
this
was
ever
in
my
mind
there
is
better
times
a
coming
and
i
hope
some
day
to
find
myself
capable
of
composing
it
was
my
heart
delight
to
compose
on
a
sentimental
subject
if
it
came
in
my
mind
just
right
the
sentimental
song
book
theme
the
author
early
life
stanza
barroda
arrived
at
this
morning
the
dawn
was
just
beginning
to
show
it
was
forlorn
to
have
to
turn
out
in
a
strange
place
at
such
a
time
and
the
blinking
lights
in
the
station
made
it
seem
night
still
but
the
gentlemen
who
had
come
to
receive
us
were
there
with
their
servants
and
they
make
quick
work
there
was
no
lost
time
we
were
soon
outside
and
moving
swiftly
through
the
soft
gray
light
and
presently
were
comfortably
housed
with
more
servants
to
help
than
we
were
used
to
and
with
rather
embarassingly
important
officials
to
direct
them
but
it
was
custom
they
spoke
ballarat
english
their
bearing
was
charming
and
hospitable
and
so
all
went
well
breakfast
was
a
satisfaction
across
the
lawns
was
visible
in
the
distance
through
the
open
window
an
indian
well
with
two
oxen
tramping
leisurely
up
and
down
long
inclines
drawing
water
and
out
of
the
stillness
came
the
suffering
screech
of
the
machinery
not
quite
musical
and
yet
soothingly
melancholy
and
dreamy
and
reposeful
a
wail
of
lost
spirits
one
might
imagine
and
commemorative
and
reminiscent
perhaps
for
of
course
the
thugs
used
to
throw
people
down
that
well
when
they
were
done
with
them
after
breakfast
the
day
began
a
sufficiently
busy
one
we
were
driven
by
winding
roads
through
a
vast
park
with
noble
forests
of
great
trees
and
with
tangles
and
jungles
of
lovely
growths
of
a
humbler
sort
and
at
one
place
three
large
gray
apes
came
out
and
pranced
across
the
road
a
good
deal
of
a
surprise
and
an
unpleasant
one
for
such
creatures
belong
in
the
menagerie
and
they
look
artificial
and
out
of
place
in
a
wilderness
we
came
to
the
city
by
and
by
and
drove
all
through
it
intensely
indian
it
was
and
crumbly
and
mouldering
and
immemorially
old
to
all
appearance
and
the
houses
oh
indescribably
quaint
and
curious
they
were
with
their
fronts
an
elaborate
of
intricate
and
beautiful
and
now
and
then
further
adorned
with
rude
pictures
of
elephants
and
princes
and
gods
done
in
shouting
colors
and
all
the
ground
floors
along
these
cramped
and
narrow
lanes
occupied
as
shops
shops
unbelievably
small
and
impossibly
packed
with
merchantable
rubbish
and
with
natives
squatting
at
their
work
of
hammering
pounding
brazing
soldering
sewing
designing
cooking
measuring
out
grain
grinding
it
repairing
idols
and
then
the
swarm
of
ragged
and
noisy
humanity
under
the
horses
feet
and
everywhere
and
the
pervading
reek
and
fume
and
smell
it
was
all
wonderful
and
delightful
imagine
a
file
of
elephants
marching
through
such
a
crevice
of
a
street
and
scraping
the
paint
off
both
sides
of
it
with
their
hides
how
big
they
must
look
and
how
little
they
must
make
the
houses
look
and
when
the
elephants
are
in
their
glittering
court
costume
what
a
contrast
they
must
make
with
the
humble
and
sordid
surroundings
and
when
a
mad
elephant
goes
raging
through
belting
right
and
left
with
his
trunk
how
do
these
swarms
of
people
get
out
of
the
way
i
suppose
it
is
a
thing
which
happens
now
and
then
in
the
mad
season
for
elephants
have
a
mad
season
i
wonder
how
old
the
town
is
there
are
patches
of
building
massive
structures
monuments
apparently
that
are
so
battered
and
worn
and
seemingly
so
tired
and
so
burdened
with
the
weight
of
age
and
so
dulled
and
stupefied
with
trying
to
remember
things
they
forgot
before
history
began
that
they
give
one
the
feeling
that
they
must
have
been
a
part
of
original
creation
this
is
indeed
one
of
the
oldest
of
the
princedoms
of
india
and
has
always
been
celebrated
for
its
barbaric

it
takes
your
enemy
and

friend
working

the

wilson
new
calendar
out
of
the
town
again
a
long
drive
through
open
country
by
winding
roads
among
secluded
villages
nestling
in
the
inviting
shade
of
tropic
vegetation
a
sabbath
stillness
everywhere
sometimes
a
pervading
sense
of
solitude
but
always
barefoot
natives
gliding
by
like
spirits
without
sound
of
footfall
and
others
in
the
distance
dissolving
away
and
vanishing
like
the
creatures
of
dreams
now
and
then
a
string
of
stately
camels
passed
by
always
interesting
things
to
look
at
and
they
were
by
nature
and
made
no
noise
indeed
there
were
no
noises
of
any
sort
in
this
paradise
yes
once
there
was
one
for
a
moment
a
file
of
native
convicts
passed
along
in
charge
of
an
officer
and
we
caught
the
soft
clink
of
their
chains
in
a
retired
spot
resting
himself
under
a
tree
was
a
holy
person
a
naked
black
fakeer
thin
and
skinny
and
all
over
with
ashes
by
and
by
to
the
elephant
stables
and
i
took
a
ride
but
it
was
by
request
i
did
not
ask
for
it
and
did
want
it
but
i
took
it
because
otherwise
they
would
have
thought
i
was
afraid
which
i
was
the
elephant
kneels
down
by
command
one
end
of
him
at
a
time
and
you
climb
the
ladder
and
get
into
the
howdah
and
then
he
gets
up
one
end
at
a
time
just
as
a
ship
gets
up
over
a
wave
and
after
that
as
he
strides
monstrously
about
his
motion
is
much
like
a
ship
motion
the
mahout
bores
into
the
back
of
his
head
with
a
great
iron
prod
and
you
wonder
at
his
temerity
and
at
the
elephant
patience
and
you
think
that
perhaps
the
patience
will
not
last
but
it
does
and
nothing
happens
the
mahout
talks
to
the
elephant
in
a
low
voice
all
the
time
and
the
elephant
seems
to
understand
it
all
and
to
be
pleased
with
it
and
he
obeys
every
order
in
the
most
contented
and
docile
way
among
these
elephants
were
two
which
were
larger
than
any
i
had
ever
seen
before
and
if
i
had
thought
i
could
learn
to
not
be
afraid
i
would
have
taken
one
of
them
while
the
police
were
not
looking
in
the
there
were
many
howdahs
that
were
made
of
silver
one
of
gold
and
one
of
old
ivory
and
equipped
with
cushions
and
canopies
of
rich
and
costly
stuffs
the
wardrobe
of
the
elephants
was
there
too
vast
velvet
covers
stiff
and
heavy
with
gold
embroidery
and
bells
of
silver
and
gold
and
ropes
of
these
metals
for
fastening
the
things
on
harness
so
to
speak
and
monster
hoops
of
massive
gold
for
the
elephant
to
wear
on
his
ankles
when
he
is
out
in
procession
on
business
of
state
but
we
did
not
see
the
treasury
of
crown
jewels
and
that
was
a
disappointment
for
in
mass
and
richness
it
ranks
only
second
in
india
by
mistake
we
were
taken
to
see
the
new
palace
instead
and
we
used
up
the
last
remnant
of
our
spare
time
there
it
was
a
pity
too
for
the
new
palace
is
mixed
modern
and
has
not
a
merit
except
costliness
it
is
wholly
foreign
to
india
and
impudent
and
out
of
place
the
architect
has
escaped
this
comes
of
overdoing
the
suppression
of
the
thugs
they
had
their
merits
the
old
palace
is
oriental
and
charming
and
in
consonance
with
the
country
the
old
palace
would
still
be
great
if
there
were
nothing
of
it
but
the
spacious
and
lofty
hall
where
the
durbars
are
held
it
is
not
a
good
place
to
lecture
in
on
account
of
the
echoes
but
it
is
a
good
place
to
hold
durbars
in
and
regulate
the
affairs
of
a
kingdom
and
that
is
what
it
is
for
if
i
had
it
i
would
have
a
durbar
every
day
instead
of
once
or
twice
a
year
the
prince
is
an
educated
gentleman
his
culture
is
european
he
has
been
in
europe
five
times
people
say
that
this
is
costly
amusement
for
him
since
in
crossing
the
sea
he
must
sometimes
be
obliged
to
drink
water
from
vessels
that
are
more
or
less
public
and
thus
damage
his
caste
to
get
it
purified
again
he
must
make
pilgrimage
to
some
renowned
hindoo
temples
and
contribute
a
fortune
or
two
to
them
his
people
are
like
the
other
hindoos
profoundly
religious
and
they
could
not
be
content
with
a
master
who
was
impure
we
failed
to
see
the
jewels
but
we
saw
the
gold
cannon
and
the
silver
one
they
seemed
to
be
they
were
not
designed
for
business
but
for
salutes
upon
rare
and
particularly
important
state
occasions
an
ancestor
of
the
present
gaikwar
had
the
silver
one
made
and
a
subsequent
ancestor
had
the
gold
one
made
in
order
to
outdo
him
this
sort
of
artillery
is
in
keeping
with
the
traditions
of
baroda
which
was
of
old
famous
for
style
and
show
it
used
to
entertain
visiting
rajahs
and
viceroys
with
illuminations
and
of
the
most
glittering
and
gorgeous
character
it
makes
the
circus
a
pale
poor
thing
in
the
train
during
a
part
of
the
return
journey
from
baroda
we
had
the
company
of
a
gentleman
who
had
with
him
a
remarkable
looking
dog
i
had
not
seen
one
of
its
kind
before
as
far
as
i
could
remember
though
of
course
i
might
have
seen
one
and
not
noticed
it
for
i
am
not
acquainted
with
dogs
but
only
with
cats
this
dog
coat
was
smooth
and
shiny
and
black
and
i
think
it
had
tan
trimmings
around
the
edges
of
the
dog
and
perhaps
underneath
it
was
a
long
low
dog
with
very
short
strange
legs
legs
that
curved
inboard
something
like
parentheses
wrong
way
indeed
it
was
made
on
the
plan
of
a
bench
for
length
and
lowness
it
seemed
to
be
satisfied
but
i
thought
the
plan
poor
and
structurally
weak
on
account
of
the
distance
between
the
forward
supports
and
those
abaft
with
age
the
dog
back
was
likely
to
sag
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
have
been
a
stronger
and
more
practicable
dog
if
it
had
had
some
more
legs
it
had
not
begun
to
sag
yet
but
the
shape
of
the
legs
showed
that
the
undue
weight
imposed
upon
them
was
beginning
to
tell
it
had
a
long
nose
and
floppy
ears
that
hung
down
and
a
resigned
expression
of
countenance
i
did
not
like
to
ask
what
kind
of
a
dog
it
was
or
how
it
came
to
be
deformed
for
it
was
plain
that
the
gentleman
was
very
fond
of
it
and
naturally
he
could
be
sensitive
about
it
from
delicacy
i
thought
it
best
not
to
seem
to
notice
it
too
much
no
doubt
a
man
with
a
dog
like
that
feels
just
as
a
person
does
who
has
a
child
that
is
out
of
true
the
gentleman
was
not
merely
fond
of
the
dog
he
was
also
proud
of
it
just
the
same
again
as
a
mother
feels
about
her
child
when
it
is
an
idiot
i
could
see
that
he
was
proud
of
it
it
was
such
a
long
dog
and
looked
so
resigned
and
pious
it
had
been
all
over
the
world
with
him
and
had
been
pilgriming
like
that
for
years
and
years
it
had
traveled
miles
by
sea
and
rail
and
had
ridden
in
front
of
him
on
his
horse
it
had
a
silver
medal
from
the
geographical
society
of
great
britain
for
its
travels
and
i
saw
it
it
had
won
prizes
in
dog
shows
both
in
india
and
in
england
i
saw
them
he
said
its
pedigree
was
on
record
in
the
kennel
club
and
that
it
was
a
dog
he
said
a
great
many
people
in
london
could
recognize
it
the
moment
they
saw
it
i
did
not
say
anything
but
i
did
not
think
it
anything
strange
i
should
know
that
dog
again
myself
yet
i
am
not
careful
about
noticing
dogs
he
said
that
when
he
walked
along
in
london
people
often
stopped
and
looked
at
the
dog
of
course
i
did
not
say
anything
for
i
did
not
want
to
hurt
his
feelings
but
i
could
have
explained
to
him
that
if
you
take
a
great
long
low
dog
like
that
and
waddle
it
along
the
street
anywhere
in
the
world
and
not
charge
anything
people
will
stop
and
look
he
was
gratified
because
the
dog
took
prizes
but
that
was
nothing
if
i
were
built
like
that
i
could
take
prizes
myself
i
wished
i
knew
what
kind
of
a
dog
it
was
and
what
it
was
for
but
i
could
not
very
well
ask
for
that
would
show
that
i
did
not
know
not
that
i
want
a
dog
like
that
but
only
to
know
the
secret
of
its
birth
i
think
he
was
going
to
hunt
elephants
with
it
because
i
know
from
remarks
dropped
by
him
that
he
has
hunted
large
game
in
india
and
africa
and
likes
it
but
i
think
that
if
he
tries
to
hunt
elephants
with
it
he
is
going
to
be
disappointed
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
suited
for
elephants
it
lacks
energy
it
lacks
force
of
character
it
lacks
bitterness
these
things
all
show
in
the
meekness
and
resignation
of
its
expression
it
would
not
attack
an
elephant
i
am
sure
of
it
it
might
not
run
if
it
saw
one
coming
but
it
looked
to
me
like
a
dog
that
would
sit
down
and
pray
i
wish
he
had
told
me
what
breed
it
was
if
there
are
others
but
i
shall
know
the
dog
next
time
and
then
if
i
can
bring
myself
to
it
i
will
put
delicacy
aside
and
ask
if
i
seem
strangely
interested
in
dogs
i
have
a
reason
for
it
for
a
dog
saved
me
from
an
embarrassing
position
once
and
that
has
made
me
grateful
to
these
animals
and
if
by
study
i
could
learn
to
tell
some
of
the
kinds
from
the
others
i
should
be
greatly
pleased
i
only
know
one
kind
apart
yet
and
that
is
the
kind
that
saved
me
that
time
i
always
know
that
kind
when
i
meet
it
and
if
it
is
hungry
or
lost
i
take
care
of
it
the
matter
happened
in
this
way
it
was
years
and
years
ago
i
had
received
a
note
from
augustin
daly
of
the
fifth
avenue
theatre
asking
me
to
call
the
next
time
i
should
be
in
new
york
i
was
writing
plays
in
those
days
and
he
was
admiring
them
and
trying
to
get
me
a
chance
to
get
them
played
in
siberia
i
took
the
first
train
the
early
one
the
one
that
leaves
hartford
at
in
the
morning
at
new
haven
i
bought
a
paper
and
found
it
filled
with
glaring
about
a
there
i
had
often
heard
of
but
had
never
felt
any
interest
in
them
because
i
supposed
they
were
lectures
that
were
not
well
attended
it
turned
out
now
that
it
was
not
that
but
a
there
was
a
column
about
the
of
this
one
which
was
called
a
saint
bernard
and
was
worth
and
was
known
to
be
the
largest
and
finest
of
his
species
in
the
world
i
read
all
this
with
interest
because
out
of
my
readings
i
dimly
remembered
how
the
priests
and
pilgrims
of
bernard
used
to
go
out
in
the
storms
and
dig
these
dogs
out
of
the
snowdrifts
when
lost
and
exhausted
and
give
them
brandy
and
save
their
lives
and
drag
them
to
the
monastery
and
restore
them
with
gruel
also
there
was
a
picture
of
this
in
the
paper
a
noble
great
creature
with
a
benignant
countenance
standing
by
a
table
he
was
placed
in
that
way
so
that
one
could
get
a
right
idea
of
his
great
dimensions
you
could
see
that
he
was
just
a
shade
higher
than
the
table
indeed
a
huge
fellow
for
a
dog
then
there
was
a
description
which
event
into
the
details
it
gave
his
enormous
weight
pounds
and
his
length
feet
inches
from
stem
to
and
his
height
feet
inch
to
the
top
of
his
back
the
pictures
and
the
figures
so
impressed
me
that
i
could
see
the
beautiful
colossus
before
me
and
i
kept
on
thinking
about
him
for
the
next
two
hours
then
i
reached
new
york
and
he
dropped
out
of
my
mind
in
the
swirl
and
tumult
of
the
hotel
lobby
i
ran
across
comedian
the
late
james
lewis
of
beloved
memory
and
i
casually
mentioned
that
i
was
going
to
call
upon
daly
in
the
evening
at
he
looked
surprised
and
said
he
reckoned
not
for
answer
i
handed
him
daly
note
its
substance
was
come
to
my
private
den
over
the
theater
where
we
can
not
be
interrupted
and
come
by
the
back
way
not
the
front
no
sixth
avenue
is
a
cigar
shop
pass
through
it
and
you
are
in
a
paved
court
with
high
buildings
all
around
enter
the
second
door
on
the
left
and
come
up
stairs
is
this
all
yes
i
said
well
you
never
get
in
why
because
you
wo
or
if
you
do
you
can
draw
on
me
for
a
hundred
dollars
for
you
will
be
the
first
man
that
has
accomplished
it
in
years
i
ca
think
what
daly
can
have
been
absorbed
in
he
has
forgotten
a
most
important
detail
and
he
will
feel
humiliated
in
the
morning
when
he
finds
that
you
tried
to
get
in
and
could
why
what
is
the
trouble
i
tell
you
you
see
at
that
point
we
were
swept
apart
by
the
crowd
somebody
detained
me
with
a
moment
talk
and
we
did
not
get
together
again
but
it
did
not
matter
i
believed
he
was
joking
anyway
at
eight
in
the
evening
i
passed
through
the
cigar
shop
and
into
the
court
and
knocked
at
the
second
door
come
in
i
entered
it
was
a
small
room
carpetless
dusty
with
a
naked
deal
table
and
two
cheap
wooden
chairs
for
furniture
a
giant
irishman
was
standing
there
with
shirt
collar
and
vest
unbuttoned
and
no
coat
on
i
put
my
hat
on
the
table
and
was
about
to
say
something
when
the
irishman
took
the
innings
himself
and
not
with
marked
courtesy
of
tone
well
sor
what
will
you
have
i
was
a
little
disconcerted
and
my
easy
confidence
suffered
a
shrinkage
the
man
stood
as
motionless
as
gibraltar
and
kept
his
unblinking
eye
upon
me
it
was
very
embarrassing
very
humiliating
i
stammered
at
a
false
start
or
two
then
i
have
just
run
down
from
av
ye
plaze
ye
not
smoke
here
ye
understand
i
laid
my
cigar
on
the
chased
my
flighty
thoughts
a
moment
then
said
in
a
placating
manner
i
i
have
come
to
see
mr
daly
oh
ye
have
have
ye
yes
well
ye
not
see
him
but
he
asked
me
to
come
oh
he
did
did
he
yes
he
sent
me
this
note
and
lem
me
see
it
for
a
moment
i
fancied
there
would
be
a
change
in
the
atmosphere
now
but
this
idea
was
premature
the
big
man
was
examining
the
note
searchingly
under
the
a
glance
showed
me
that
he
had
it
upside
down
disheartening
evidence
that
he
could
not
read
is
ut
his
own
handwrite
yes
he
wrote
it
himself
he
did
did
he
yes
h
well
then
why
ud
he
write
it
like
that
how
do
you
mean
i
mane
why
wud
he
put
his
naime
to
ut
his
name
is
to
it
that
not
it
you
are
looking
at
my
name
i
thought
that
that
was
a
home
shot
but
he
did
not
betray
that
he
had
been
hit
he
said
it
not
an
aisy
one
to
spell
how
do
you

a
fatal
question
i
recognized
that
i
was
defeated
if
i
answered
no
he
would
cut
the
matter
short
and
wave
me
to
the
door
without
the
grace
of
a
word
i
saw
it
in
his
uncompromising
eye
if
i
said
i
was
a
lecturer
he
would
despise
me
and
dismiss
me
with
opprobrious
words
if
i
said
i
was
a
dramatist
he
would
throw
me
out

i
saw
that
my
case
was
hopeless
so
i
chose
the
course
which
seemed
least
humiliating
i
would
pocket
my
shame
and
glide
out
without
answering
the
silence
was
growing
lengthy
i
ask
ye
again
are
ye
in
the
show

yerself
yes
i
said
it
with
splendid
confidence
for
in
that
moment
the
very
twin
of
that
grand
new
haven
dog
loafed
into
the
room
and
i
saw
that
eye
light
eloquently
with
pride
and
affection
ye
are
and
what
is
it
i
got
a
in
new
haven
the
weather

change

and
that

grand
show

a
wonderful
show
sir
and
a
proud
man
i
am
to
see
your
honor
this
day
and
ye
be
an
expert
sir
and
ye
know
all
about
dogs
more
than
ever
they
know
theirselves
i
take
me
oath
to
ut
i
said
with
modesty
i
believe
i
have
some
reputation
that
way
in
fact
my
business
requires
it
ye
have
some
reputation
your
honor
bedad
i
believe
you
there
not
a
jintleman
in
the
worrld
that
can
lay
over
ye
in
the
judgmint
of
a
dog
sir
now
i
vinture
that
your
honor
know
that
dog
dimensions
there
better
than
he
knows
them
his
own
self
and
just
by
the
casting
of
your
educated
eye
upon
him
would
you
mind
giving
a
guess
if
ye
be
so
good
i
knew
that
upon
my
answer
would
depend
my
fate
if
i
made
this
dog
bigger
than
the
it
would
be
bad
diplomacy
and
suspicious
if
i
fell
too
far
short
of
the
prizedog
that
would
be
equally
damaging
the
dog
was
standing
by
the
table
and
i
believed
i
knew
the
difference
between
him
and
the
one
whose
picture
i
had
seen
in
the
newspaper
to
a
shade
i
spoke
promptly
up
and
said
it
no
trouble
to
guess
this
noble
creature
figures
height
three
feet
length
four
feet
and
of
an
inch
weight
a
hundred
and
and
a
quarter
the
man
snatched
his
hat
from
its
peg
and
danced
on
it
with
joy
shouting
ye
hardly
missed
it
the
hair
breadth
hardly
the
shade
of
a
shade
your
honor
oh
it
the
miraculous
eye
ye
got
for
the
judgmint
of
a
dog
and
still
pouring
out
his
admiration
of
my
capacities
he
snatched
off
his
vest
and
scoured
off
one
of
the
wooden
chairs
with
it
and
scrubbed
it
and
polished
it
and
said
there
sit
down
your
honor
i
ashamed
of
meself
that
i
forgot
ye
were
standing
all
this
time
and
do
put
on
your
hat
ye
must
take
cold
it
a
drafty
place
and
here
is
your
cigar
sir
a
getting
cold
give
ye
a
light
there
the
place
is
all
yours
sir
and
if
ye
just
put
your
feet
on
the
table
and
make
yourself
at
home
i
stir
around
and
get
a
candle
and
light
ye
up
the
ould
crazy
stairs
and
see
that
ye
do
come
to
anny
harm
for
be
this
time
daly
be
that
impatient
to
see
your
honor
that
he
be
taking
the
roof
off
he
conducted
me
cautiously
and
tenderly
up
the
stairs
lighting
the
way
and
protecting
me
with
friendly
warnings
then
pushed
the
door
open
and
bowed
me
in
and
went
his
way
mumbling
hearty
things
about
my
wonderful
eye
for
points
of
a
dog
daly
was
writing
and
had
his
back
to
me
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
presently
then
jumped
up
and
said
oh
dear
me
i
forgot
all
about
giving
instructions
i
was
just
writing
you
to
beg
a
thousand
pardons
but
how
is
it
you
are
here
how
did
you
get
by
that
irishman
you
are
the
first
man
that
done
it
in
five
and
twenty
years
you
did
bribe
him
i
know
that
there
not
money
enough
in
new
york
to
do
it
and
you
did
persuade
him
he
is
all
ice
and
iron
there
is
a
soft
place
nor
a
warm
one
in
him
anywhere
that
is
your
secret
look
here
you
owe
me
a
hundred
dollars
for
unintentionally
giving
you
a
chance
to
perform
a
miracle
for
it
is
a
miracle
that
you
done
that
is
all
right
i
said
collect
it
of
jimmy
lewis
that
good
dog
not
only
did
me
that
good
turn
in
the
time
of
my
need
but
he
won
for
me
the
envious
reputation
among
all
the
theatrical
people
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
of
being
the
only
man
in
history
who
had
ever
run

the

the

came
always
together

on
the
train
fifty
years
ago
when
i
was
a
boy
in
the
then
remote
and
sparsely
peopled
mississippi
valley
vague
tales
and
rumors
of
a
mysterious
body
of
professional
murderers
came
wandering
in
from
a
country
which
was
constructively
as
far
from
us
as
the
constellations
blinking
in
space
india
vague
tales
and
rumors
of
a
sect
called
thugs
who
waylaid
travelers
in
lonely
places
and
killed
them
for
the
contentment
of
a
god
whom
they
worshiped
tales
which
everybody
liked
to
listen
to
and
nobody
believed
except
with
reservations
it
was
considered
that
the
stories
had
gathered
bulk
on
their
travels
the
matter
died
down
and
a
lull
followed
then
eugene
sue
wandering
jew
appeared
and
made
great
talk
for
a
while
one
character
in
it
was
a
chief
of
thugs
feringhea
a
mysterious
and
terrible
indian
who
was
as
slippery
and
sly
as
a
serpent
and
as
deadly
and
he
stirred
up
the
thug
interest
once
more
but
it
did
not
last
it
presently
died
again
this
time
to
stay
dead
at
first
glance
it
seems
strange
that
this
should
have
happened
but
really
it
was
not
strange
on
the
contrary
it
was
natural
i
mean
on
our
side
of
the
water
for
the
source
whence
the
thug
tales
mainly
came
was
a
government
report
and
without
doubt
was
not
republished
in
america
it
was
probably
never
even
seen
there
government
reports
have
no
general
circulation
they
are
distributed
to
the
few
and
are
not
always
read
by
those
few
i
heard
of
this
report
for
the
first
time
a
day
or
two
ago
and
borrowed
it
it
is
full
of
fascinations
and
it
turns
those
dim
dark
fairy
tales
of
my
boyhood
days
into
realities
the
report
was
made
in
by
major
sleeman
of
the
indian
service
and
was
printed
in
calcutta
in
it
is
a
clumsy
great
fat
poor
sample
of
the
printer
art
but
good
enough
for
a
government
in
that
old
day
and
in
that
remote
region
perhaps
to
major
sleeman
was
given
the
general
superintendence
of
the
giant
task
of
ridding
india
of
thuggee
and
he
and
his
seventeen
assistants
accomplished
it
it
was
the
augean
stables
over
again
captain
vallancey
writing
in
a
madras
journal
in
those
old
times
makes
this
remark
the
day
that
sees
this
evil
eradicated
from
india
and
known
only
in
name
will
greatly
tend
to
immortalize
british
rule
in
the
east
he
did
not
overestimate
the
magnitude
and
difficulty
of
the
work
nor
the
immensity
of
the
credit
which
would
justly
be
due
to
british
rule
in
case
it
was
accomplished
thuggee
became
known
to
the
british
authorities
in
india
about
but
its
wide
prevalence
was
not
suspected
it
was
not
regarded
as
a
serious
matter
and
no
systematic
measures
were
taken
for
its
suppression
until
about
about
that
time
major
sleeman
captured
eugene
feringhea
and
got
him
to
turn
king
evidence
the
revelations
were
so
stupefying
that
sleeman
was
not
able
to
believe
them
sleeman
thought
he
knew
every
criminal
within
his
jurisdiction
and
that
the
worst
of
them
were
merely
thieves
but
feringhea
told
him
that
he
was
in
reality
living
in
the
midst
of
a
swarm
of
professional
murderers
that
they
had
been
all
about
him
for
many
years
and
that
they
buried
their
dead
close
by
these
seemed
insane
tales
but
feringhea
said
come
and
see
and
he
took
him
to
a
grave
and
dug
up
a
hundred
bodies
and
told
him
all
the
circumstances
of
the
killings
and
named
the
thugs
who
had
done
the
work
it
was
a
staggering
business
sleeman
captured
some
of
these
thugs
and
proceeded
to
examine
them
separately
and
with
proper
precautions
against
collusion
for
he
would
not
believe
any
unsupported
word
the
evidence
gathered
proved
the
truth
of
what
feringhea
had
said
and
also
revealed
the
fact
that
gangs
of
thugs
were
plying
their
trade
all
over
india
the
astonished
government
now
took
hold
of
thuggee
and
for
ten
years
made
systematic
and
relentless
war
upon
it
and
finally
destroyed
it
gang
after
gang
was
captured
tried
and
punished
the
thugs
were
harried
and
hunted
from
one
end
of
india
to
the
other
the
government
got
all
their
secrets
out
of
them
and
also
got
the
names
of
the
members
of
the
bands
and
recorded
them
in
a
book
together
with
their
birthplaces
and
places
of
residence
the
thugs
were
worshipers
of
bhowanee
and
to
this
god
they
sacrificed
anybody
that
came
handy
but
they
kept
the
dead
man
things
themselves
for
the
god
cared
for
nothing
but
the
corpse
men
were
initiated
into
the
sect
with
solemn
ceremonies
then
they
were
taught
how
to
strangle
a
person
with
the
sacred
but
were
not
allowed
to
perform
officially
with
it
until
after
long
practice
no
strangler
could
choke
a
man
to
death
quickly
enough
to
keep
him
from
uttering
a
sound
a
muffled
scream
gurgle
gasp
moan
or
something
of
the
sort
but
the
expert
work
was
instantaneous
the
cloth
was
whipped
around
the
victim
neck
there
was
a
sudden
twist
and
the
head
fell
silently
forward
the
eyes
starting
from
the
sockets
and
all
was
over
the
thug
carefully
guarded
against
resistance
it
was
usual
to
to
get
the
victims
to
sit
down
for
that
was
the
handiest
position
for
business
if
the
thug
had
planned
india
itself
it
could
not
have
been
more
conveniently
arranged
for
the
needs
of
his
occupation
there
were
no
public
conveyances
there
were
no
conveyances
for
hire
the
traveler
went
on
foot
or
in
a
bullock
cart
or
on
a
horse
which
he
bought
for
the
purpose
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
his
own
little
state
or
principality
he
was
among
strangers
nobody
knew
him
nobody
took
note
of
him
and
from
that
time
his
movements
could
no
longer
be
traced
he
did
not
stop
in
towns
or
villages
but
camped
outside
of
them
and
sent
his
servants
in
to
buy
provisions
there
were
no
habitations
between
villages
whenever
he
was
between
villages
he
was
an
easy
prey
particularly
as
he
usually
traveled
by
night
to
avoid
the
heat
he
was
always
being
overtaken
by
strangers
who
offered
him
the
protection
of
their
company
or
asked
for
the
protection
of
his
and
these
strangers
were
often
thugs
as
he
presently
found
out
to
his
cost
the
landholders
the
native
police
the
petty
princes
the
village
officials
the
customs
officers
were
in
many
cases
protectors
and
harborers
of
the
thugs
and
betrayed
travelers
to
them
for
a
share
of
the
spoil
at
first
this
condition
of
things
made
it
next
to
impossible
for
the
government
to
catch
the
marauders
they
were
spirited
away
by
these
watchful
friends
all
through
a
vast
continent
thus
infested
helpless
people
of
every
caste
and
kind
moved
along
the
paths
and
trails
in
couples
and
groups
silently
by
night
carrying
the
commerce
of
the
country
treasure
jewels
money
and
petty
batches
of
silks
spices
and
all
manner
of
wares
it
was
a
paradise
for
the
thug
when
the
autumn
opened
the
thugs
began
to
gather
together
by
other
people
had
to
have
interpreters
at
every
turn
but
not
the
thugs
they
could
talk
together
no
matter
how
far
apart
they
were
born
for
they
had
a
language
of
their
own
and
they
had
secret
signs
by
which
they
knew
each
other
for
thugs
and
they
were
always
friends
even
their
diversities
of
religion
and
caste
were
sunk
in
devotion
to
their
calling
and
the
moslem
and
the
and
hindoo
were
staunch
and
affectionate
brothers
in
thuggery
when
a
gang
had
been
assembled
they
had
religious
worship
and
waited
for
an
omen
they
had
definite
notions
about
the
omens
the
cries
of
certain
animals
were
good
omens
the
cries
of
certain
other
creatures
were
bad
omens
a
bad
omen
would
stop
proceedings
and
send
the
men
home
the
sword
and
the
were
sacred
emblems
the
thugs
worshiped
the
sword
at
home
before
going
out
to
the
the
was
worshiped
at
the
place
of
assembly
the
chiefs
of
most
of
the
bands
performed
the
religious
ceremonies
themselves
but
the
kaets
delegated
them
to
certain
official
stranglers
chaurs
the
rites
of
the
kaets
were
so
holy
that
no
one
but
the
chaur
was
allowed
to
touch
the
vessels
and
other
things
used
in
them
thug
methods
exhibit
a
curious
mixture
of
caution
and
the
absence
of
it
cold
business
calculation
and
sudden
unreflecting
impulse
but
there
were
two
details
which
were
constant
and
not
subject
to
caprice
patient
persistence
in
following
up
the
prey
and
pitilessness
when
the
time
came
to
act
caution
was
exhibited
in
the
strength
of
the
bands
they
never
felt
comfortable
and
confident
unless
their
strength
exceeded
that
of
any
party
of
travelers
they
were
likely
to
meet
by
four
or
fivefold
yet
it
was
never
their
purpose
to
attack
openly
but
only
when
the
victims
were
off
their
guard
when
they
got
hold
of
a
party
of
travelers
they
often
moved
along
in
their
company
several
days
using
all
manner
of
arts
to
win
their
friendship
and
get
their
confidence
at
last
when
this
was
accomplished
to
their
satisfaction
the
real
business
began
a
few
thugs
were
privately
detached
and
sent
forward
in
the
dark
to
select
a
good
and
dig
the
graves
when
the
rest
reached
the
spot
a
halt
was
called
for
a
rest
or
a
smoke
the
travelers
were
invited
to
sit
by
signs
the
chief
appointed
certain
thugs
to
sit
down
in
front
of
the
travelers
as
if
to
wait
upon
them
others
to
sit
down
beside
them
and
engage
them
in
conversation
and
certain
expert
stranglers
to
stand
behind
the
travelers
and
be
ready
when
the
signal
was
given
the
signal
was
usually
some
commonplace
remark
like
bring
the
tobacco
sometimes
a
considerable
wait
ensued
after
all
the
actors
were
in
their
places
the
chief
was
biding
his
time
in
order
to
make
everything
sure
meantime
the
talk
droned
on
dim
figures
moved
about
in
the
dull
light
peace
and
tranquility
reigned
the
travelers
resigned
themselves
to
the
pleasant
reposefulness
and
comfort
of
the
situation
unconscious
of
the
standing
motionless
at
their
backs
the
time
was
ripe
now
and
the
signal
came
bring
the
tobacco
there
was
a
mute
swift
movement
all
in
the
same
instant
the
men
at
each
victim
sides
seized
his
hands
the
man
in
front
seized
his
feet
and
pulled
the
man
at
his
back
whipped
the
cloth
around
his
neck
and
gave
it
a
twist
the
head
sunk
forward
the
tragedy
was
over
the
bodies
were
stripped
and
covered
up
in
the
graves
the
spoil
packed
for
transportation
then
the
thugs
gave
pious
thanks
to
bhowanee
and
departed
on
further
holy
service
the
report
shows
that
the
travelers
moved
in
exceedingly
small
groups
twos
threes
fours
as
a
rule
a
party
with
a
dozen
in
it
was
rare
the
thugs
themselves
seem
to
have
been
the
only
people
who
moved
in
force
they
went
about
in
gangs
of
and
one
gang
of
is
mentioned
considering
their
numbers
their
catch
was
not
extraordinary
particularly
when
you
consider
that
they
were
not
in
the
least
fastidious
but
took
anybody
they
could
get
whether
rich
or
poor
and
sometimes
even
killed
children
now
and
then
they
killed
women
but
it
was
considered
sinful
to
do
it
and
unlucky
the
season
was
six
or
eight
months
long
one
season
the
half
dozen
bundelkand

gwalior
gangs

they
murdered
people

season
the

about

brevity

yet
the
character

is
a
holy
creature
and
some
of
the
gangs
spared
him
on

account
no
matter
how
slack

might
be
but
other
gangs
slaughtered
not
only
him
but
even
that
sacredest
of
sacred
creatures
the
fakeer
that
repulsive
thing
that
goes
around
naked
and
mats
his
bushy
hair
with
dust
and
dirt
and
so
beflours
his
lean
body
with
ashes
that
he
looks
like
a
specter
sometimes
a
fakeer
trusted
a
shade
too
far
in
the
protection
of
his
sacredness
in
the
middle
of
a
of
feringhea
who
had
been
out
with
forty
thugs
i
find
a
case
of
the
kind
after
the
killing
of
men
and
one
woman
the
fakeer
appears
on
the
scene
approaching
doregow
met
pundits
also
a
fakeer
mounted
on
a
pony
he
was
plastered
over
with
sugar
to
collect
flies
and
was
covered
with
them
drove
off
the
fakeer
and
killed
the
other
three
leaving
doregow
the
fakeer
joined
again
and
went
on
in
company
to
raojana
met
khutries
on
their
way
from
bombay
to
nagpore
drove
off
the
fakeer
with
stones
and
killed
the
men
in
camp
and
buried
them
in
the
grove
next
day
the
fakeer
joined
again
made
him
leave
at
mana
beyond
there
fell
in
with
two
kahars
and
a
sepoy
and
came
on
towards
the
place
selected
for
the
murder
when
near
it
the
fakeer
came
again
losing
all
patience
with
him
gave
mithoo
one
of
the
gang
rupees
to
murder
him
and
take
the
sin
upon
himself
all
four
were
strangled
including
the
fakeer
surprised
to
find
among
the
fakeer
effects
pounds
of
coral
strings
of
small
pearls
strings
of
large
pearls
and
a
gilt
necklace
it
it
curious
the
little
effect
that
time
has
upon
a
really
interesting
circumstance
this
one
so
old
so
long
ago
gone
down
into
oblivion
reads
with
the
same
freshness
and
charm
that
attach
to
the
news
in
the
morning
paper
one
spirits
go
up
then
down
then
up
again
following
the
chances
which
the
fakeer
is
running
now
you
hope
now
you
despair
now
you
hope
again
and
at
last
everything
comes
out
right
and
you
feel
a
great
wave
of
personal
satisfaction
go
weltering
through
you
and
without
thinking
you
put
out
your
hand
to
pat
mithoo
on
the
back
when
puff
the
whole
thing
has
vanished
away
there
is
nothing
there
mithoo
and
all
the
crowd
have
been
dust
and
ashes
and
forgotten
oh
so
many
many
many
lagging
years
and
then
comes
a
sense
of
injury
you
know
whether
mithoo
got
the
swag
along
with
the
sin
or
had
to
divide
up
the
swag
and
keep
all
the
sin
himself
there
is
no
literary
art
about
a
government
report
it
stops
a
story
right
in
the
most
interesting
place
these
reports
of
thug
expeditions
run
along
interminably
in
one
monotonous
tune
met
a
sepoy
killed
him
met
pundits
killed
them
met
rajpoots
and
a
woman
killed
them
and
so
on
till
the
statistics
get
to
be
pretty
dry
but
this
small
trip
of
feringhea
forty
had
some
little
variety
about
it
once
they
came
across
a
man
hiding
in
a
grave
a
thief
he
had
stolen
rupees
from
dhunroj
seith
of
parowtee
they
strangled
him
and
took
the
money
they
had
no
patience
with
thieves
they
killed
two
and
got
rupees
they
came
across
two
bullocks
laden
with
copper
pice
and
killed
the
four
drivers
and
took
the
money
there
must
have
been
half
a
ton
of
it
i
think
it
takes
a
double
handful
of
pice
to
make
an
anna
and
annas
to
make
a
rupee
and
even
in
those
days
the
rupee
was
worth
only
half
a
dollar
coming
back
over
their
tracks
from
baroda
they
had
another
picturesque
stroke
of
luck
lohars
of
oodeypore
put
a
traveler
in
their
charge
for
safety
dear
dear
across
this
abyssmal
gulf
of
time
we
still
see
feringhea
lips
uncover
his
teeth
and
through
the
dim
haze
we
catch
the
incandescent
glimmer
of
his
smile
he
accepted
that
trust
good
man
and
so
we
know
what
went
with
the
traveler
even
rajahs
had
no
terrors
for
feringhea
he
came
across
an
belonging
to
the
rajah
of
oodeypore
and
promptly
strangled
him
a
total
of
men
and
women
murdered
on
this
expedition
among
the
reports
of
expeditions
we
find
mention
of
victims
of
almost
every
quality
and
estate
also
a
prince
cook
and
even
the
of
that
sublime
lord
of
lords
and
king
of
kings
the
of
india
how
broad
they
were
in
their
tastes
they
also
murdered
actors
poor
wandering
barnstormers
there
are
two
instances
recorded
the
first
one
by
a
gang
of
thugs
under
a
chief
who
soils
a
great
name
borne
by
a
better
man
kipling
deathless
gungadin
after
murdering
sepoys
going
on
toward
indore
met
strolling
players
and
persuaded
them
to
come
with
us
on
the
pretense
that
we
would
see
their
performance
at
the
next
stage
murdered
them
at
a
temple
near
bhopal
second
instance
at
deohuttee
joined
by
comedians
murdered
them
eastward
of
that
place
but
this
gang
was
a
particularly
bad
crew
on
that
expedition
they
murdered
a
fakeer
and
twelve
beggars
and
yet
bhowanee
protected
them
for
once
when
they
were
strangling
a
man
in
a
wood
when
a
crowd
was
going
by
close
at
hand
and
the
noose
slipped
and
the
man
screamed
bhowanee
made
a
camel
burst
out
at
the
same
moment
with
a
roar
that
drowned
the
scream
and
before
the
man
could
repeat
it
the
breath
was
choked
out
of
his
body
the
cow
is
so
sacred
in
india
that
to
kill
her
keeper
is
an
awful
sacrilege
and
even
the
thugs
recognized
this
yet
now
and
then
the
lust
for
blood
was
too
strong
and
so
they
did
kill
a
few
in
one
of
these
instances
the
witness
who
killed
the
cowherd
said
in
thuggee
this
is
strictly
forbidden
and
is
an
act
from
which
no
good
can
come
i
was
ill
of
a
fever
for
ten
days
afterward
i
do
believe
that
evil
will
follow
the
murder
of
a
man
with
a
cow
if
there
be
no
cow
it
does
not
signify
another
thug
said
he
held
the
cowherd
feet
while
this
witness
did
the
strangling
he
felt
no
concern
because
the
bad
fortune
of
such
a
deed
is
upon
the
strangler
and
not
upon
the
assistants
even
if
there
should
be
a
hundred
of
them
there
were
thousands
of
thugs
roving
over
india
constantly
during
many
generations
they
made
thug
gee
a
hereditary
vocation
and
taught
it
to
their
sons
and
to
their
son
sons
boys
were
in
full
membership
as
early
as
years
of
age
veterans
were
still
at
work
at
what
was
the
fascination
what
was
the
impulse
apparently
it
was
partly
piety
largely
gain
and
there
is
reason
to
suspect
that
the
sport
afforded
was
the
chiefest
fascination
of
all
meadows
taylor
makes
a
thug
in
one
of
his
books
claim
that
the
pleasure
of
killing
men
was
the
white
instinct
enlarged
refined
ennobled
i
will
quote
the
passage

you
are
fired
by
an
eager
impulse

the
thug
said
how
many
of
you
english
are
passionately
devoted
to
sporting
your
days
and
months
are
passed
in
its
excitement
a
tiger
a
panther
a

or
a

rouses
your
utmost
energies
for
its
destruction
you
even
risk
your
lives
in

pursuit
how
much
higher
game
is
a
thug
that
must
really
be
the
secret
of
the
rise
and
development
of
thuggee
the
joy
of
killing
the
joy
of
seeing
killing
done
these
are
traits
of
the
human
race
at
large
we
white
people
are
merely
modified
thugs
thugs
fretting
under
the
restraints
of
a
not
very
thick
skin
of
civilization
thugs
who
long
ago
enjoyed
the
slaughter
of
the
roman
arena
and
later
the
burning
of
doubtful
christians
by
authentic
christians
in
the
public
squares
and
who
now
with
the
thugs
of
spain
and
nimes
flock
to
enjoy
the
blood
and
misery
of
the
bullring
we
have
no
tourists
of
either
sex
or
any
religion
who
are
able
to
resist
the
delights
of
the
when
opportunity
offers
and
we
are
gentle
thugs
in
the
and
love
to
chase
a
tame
rabbit
and
kill
it
still
we
have
made
some
and
in
truth
scarcely
worth
mentioning
and
certainly
nothing
to
be
proud
of
still
it
is
progress
we
no
longer
take
pleasure
in
slaughtering
or
burning
helpless
men
we
have
reached
a
little
altitude
where
we
may
look
down
upon
the
indian
thugs
with
a
complacent
shudder
and
we
may
even
hope
for
a
day
many
centuries
hence
when
our
posterity
will
look
down
upon
us
in
the
same
way
there
are
many
indications
that
the
thug
often
hunted
men
for
the
mere
sport
of
it
that
the
fright
and
pain
of
the
quarry
were
no
more
to
him
than
are
the
fright
and
pain
of
the
rabbit
or
the
stag
to
us
and
that
he
was
no
more
ashamed
of
beguiling
his
game
with
deceits
and
abusing
its
trust
than
are
we
when
we
have
imitated
a
wild
animal
call
and
shot
it
when
it
honored
us
with
its
confidence
and
came
to
see
what
we
wanted
madara
son
of
nihal
and
i
ramzam
set
out
from
kotdee
in
the
cold
weather
and
followed
the
high
road
for
about
twenty
days
in
search
of
travelers
until
we
came
to
selempore
where
we
met
a
very
old
man
going
to
the
east
we
won
his
confidence
in
this
manner
he
carried
a
load
which
was
too
heavy
for
his
old
age
i
said
to
him
are
an
old
man
i
will
aid
you
in
carrying
your
load
as
you
are
from
my
part
of
the
country
he
said
well
take
me
with
you
so
we
took
him
with
us
to
selempore
where
we
slept
that
night
we
woke
him
next
morning
before
dawn
and
set
out
and
at
the
distance
of
three
miles
we
seated
him
to
rest
while
it
was
still
very
dark
madara
was
ready
behind
him
and
strangled
him
he
never
spoke
a
word
he
was
about
or
years
of
age
another
gang
fell
in
with
a
couple
of
barbers
and
persuaded
them
to
come
along
in
their
company
by
promising
them
the
job
of
shaving
the
whole
crew
thugs
at
the
place
appointed
for
the
murder
got
shaved
and
actually
paid
the
barbers
for
their
work
then
killed
them
and
took
back
the
money
a
gang
of
thugs
came
across
two
brahmins
and
a
shopkeeper
on
the
road
beguiled
them
into
a
grove
and
got
up
a
concert
for
their
entertainment
while
these
poor
fellows
were
listening
to
the
music
the
stranglers
were
standing
behind
them
and
at
the
proper
moment
for
dramatic
effect
they
applied
the
noose
the
most
devoted
fisherman
must
have
a
bite
at
least
as
often
as
once
a
week
or
his
passion
will
cool
and
he
will
put
up
his
tackle
the
must
find
a
tiger
at
least
once
a
fortnight
or
he
will
get
tired
and
quit
the
enthusiasm
will
waste
away
little
by
little
and
his
zeal
will
perish
at
last
if
he
plod
around
a
month
without
finding
a
member
of
that
noble
family
to
assassinate
but
when
the
lust
in
the
hunter
heart
is
for
the
noblest
of
all
quarries
man
how
different
is
the
case
and
how
watery
and
poor
is
the
zeal
and
how
childish
the
endurance
of
those
other
hunters
by
comparison
then
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
nor
fatigue
nor
deferred
hope
nor
monotonous
disappointment
nor
lapse
of
time
can
conquer
the
hunter
patience
or
weaken
the
joy
of
his
quest
or
cool
the
splendid
rage
of
his
desire
of
all
the
that
burn
in
the
breast
of
man
there
is
none
that
can
lift
him
superior
to
discouragements
like
these
but
the
one
the
royal
sport
the
supreme
sport
whose
quarry
is
his
brother
by
comparison
is
a
colorless
poor
thing
for
all
it
has
been
so
bragged
about
why
the
thug
was
content
to
tramp
patiently
along
afoot
in
the
wasting
heat
of
india
week
after
week
at
an
average
of
nine
or
ten
miles
a
day
if
he
might
but
hope
to
find
game
some
time
or
other
and
refresh
his
longing
soul
with
blood
here
is
an
instance
i
ramzam
and
hyder
set
out
for
the
purpose
of
strangling
travelers
from
guddapore
and
proceeded
via
the
fort
of
julalabad
newulgunge
bangermow
on
the
banks
of
the
ganges
upwards
of
miles
from
whence
we
returned
by
another
route
still
no
travelers
till
we
reached
bowaneegunge
where
we
fell
in
with
a
traveler
a
boatman
we
inveigled
him
and
about
two
miles
east
of
there
hyder
strangled
him
as
he
stood
for
he
was
troubled
and
afraid
and
would
not
sit
we
then
made
a
long
journey
about
miles
and
reached
hussunpore
bundwa
where
at
the
tank
we
fell
in
with
a
traveler
he
slept
there
that
night
next
morning
we
followed
him
and
tried
to
win
his
confidence
at
the
distance
of
two
miles
we
endeavored
to
induce
him
to
sit
down
but
he
would
not
having
become
aware
of
us
i
attempted
to
strangle
him
as
he
walked
along
but
did
not
succeed
both
of
us
then
fell
upon
him
he
made
a
great
outcry
are
murdering
me
at
length
we
strangled
him
and
flung
his
body
into
a
well
after
this
we
returned
to
our
homes
having
been
out
a
month
and
traveled
about
miles
a
total
of
two
men
murdered
on
the
expedition
and
here
is
another
by
the
terrible
futty
khan
a
man
with
a
tremendous
record
to
be
by
and
by
i
with
three
others
traveled
for
about
days
a
distance
of
about
miles
in
search
of
victims
along
the
highway
to
bundwa
and
returned
by
davodpore
another
miles
during
which
journey
we
had
only
one
murder
which
happened
in
this
manner
four
miles
to
the
east
of
noubustaghat
we
fell
in
with
a
traveler
an
old
man
i
with
koshal
and
hyder
inveigled
him
and
accompanied
him
that
day
within
miles
of
rampoor
where
after
dark
in
a
lonely
place
we
got
him
to
sit
down
and
rest
and
while
i
kept
him
in
talk
seated
before
him
hyder
behind
strangled
him
he
made
no
resistance
koshal
stabbed
him
under
the
arms
and
in
the
throat
and
we
flung
the
body
into
a
running
stream
we
got
about
or
rupees
each
or
we
then
proceeded
homewards
a
total
of
one
man
murdered
on
this
expedition
there
they
tramped
miles
were
gone
about
three
months
and
harvested
two
dollars
and
a
half
apiece
but
the
mere
pleasure
of
the
hunt
was
sufficient
that
was
pay
enough
they
did
no
grumbling
every
now
and
then
in
this
big
book
one
comes
across
that
pathetic
remark
we
tried
to
get
him
to
sit
down
but
he
would
not
it
tells
the
whole
story
some
accident
had
awakened
the
suspicion
in
him
that
these
smooth
friends
who
had
been
petting
and
coddling
him
and
making
him
feel
so
safe
and
so
fortunate
after
his
forlorn
and
lonely
wanderings
were
the
dreaded
thugs
and
now
their
ghastly
invitation
to
sit
and
rest
had
confirmed
its
truth
he
knew
there
was
no
help
for
him
and
that
he
was
looking
his
last
upon
earthly
things
but
he
would
not
sit
no
not
that
it
was
too
awful
to
think
of
there
are
a
number
of
instances
which
indicate
that
when
a
man
had
once
tasted
the
regal
joys
of
he
could
not
be
content
with
the
dull
monotony
of
a
crimeless
life
after
ward
example
from
a
testimony
we
passed
through
to
kurnaul
where
we
found
a
former
thug
named
junooa
an
old
comrade
of
ours
who
had
turned
religious
mendicant
and
become
a
disciple
and
holy
he
came
to
us
in
the
serai
and
weeping
with
joy
returned
to
his
old
trade
neither
wealth
nor
honors
nor
dignities
could
satisfy
a
reformed
thug
for
long
he
would
throw
them
all
away
someday
and
go
back
to
the
lurid
pleasures
of
hunting
men
and
being
hunted
himself
by
the
british
ramzam
was
taken
into
a
great
native
grandee
service
and
given
authority
over
five
villages
my
authority
extended
over
these
people
to
summons
them
to
my
presence
to
make
them
stand
or
sit
i
dressed
well
rode
my
pony
and
had
two
sepoys
a
scribe
and
a
village
guard
to
attend
me
during
three
years
i
used
to
pay
each
village
a
monthly
visit
and
no
one
suspected
that
i
was
a
thug
the
chief
man
used
to
wait
on
me
to
transact
business
and
as
i
passed
along
old
and
young
made
their
salaam
to
me
and
yet
during
that
very
three
years
he
got
leave
of
absence
to
attend
a
wedding
and
instead
went
off
on
a
thugging
lark
with
six
other
thugs
and
hunted
the
highway
for
fifteen
days
with
satisfactory
results
afterwards
he
held
a
great
office
under
a
rajah
there
he
had
ten
miles
of
country
under
his
command
and
a
military
guard
of
fifteen
men
with
authority
to
call
out
more
upon
occasion
but
the
british
got
on
his
track
and
they
crowded
him
so
that
he
had
to
give
himself
up
see
what
a
figure
he
was
when
he
was
gotten
up
for
style
and
had
all
his
things
on
i
was
fully
armed
a
sword
shield
pistols
a
matchlock
musket
and
a
flint
gun
for
i
was
fond
of
being
thus
arrayed
and
when
so
armed
feared
not
though
forty
men
stood
before
me
he
gave
himself
up
and
proudly
proclaimed
himself
a
thug
then
by
request
he
agreed
to
betray
his
friend
and
pal
buhram
a
thug
with
the
most
tremendous
record
in
india
i
went
to
the
house
where
buhram
slept
often
has
he
led
our
gangs
i
woke
him
he
knew
me
well
and
came
outside
to
me
it
was
a
cold
night
so
under
pretence
of
warming
myself
but
in
reality
to
have
light
for
his
seizure
by
the
guards
i
lighted
some
straw
and
made
a
blaze
we
were
warming
our
hands
the
guards
drew
around
us
i
said
to
them
is
buhram
and
he
was
seized
just
as
a
cat
seizes
a
mouse
then
buhram
said
am
a
thug
my
father
was
a
thug
my
grandfather
was
a
thug
and
i
have
thugged
with
many
so
spoke
the
mighty
hunter
the
mightiest
of
the
mighty
the
gordon
cumming
of
his
day
not
much
regret
noticeable
in
having
planted
a
bullet
in
the
of
an
elephant
and
caused
the
agonized
creature
to
lean
for
support
against
a
tree
i
proceeded
to
brew
some
coffee
having
refreshed
myself
taking
observations
of
the
spasms
and
writhings
between
the
sips
i
resolved
to
make
experiments
on
vulnerable
points
and
approaching
very
near
i
fired
several
bullets
at
different
parts
of
his
enormous
skull
he
only
acknowledged
the
shots
by
a
movement
of
his
trunk
with
the
point
of
which
he
gently
touched
the
wounds
with
a
striking
and
peculiar
action
surprised
and
shocked
to
find
that
i
was
only
prolonging
the
suffering
of
the
noble
beast
which
bore
its
trials
with
such
dignified
composure
i
resolved
to
finish
the
proceeding
with
all
possible
despatch
and
accordingly
opened
fire
upon
him
from
the
left
side
aiming
at
the
shoulder
i
fired
six
shots
with
the
rifle
which
must
have
eventually
proved
mortal
after
which
i
fired
six
shots
at
the
same
part
with
the
dutch
large
tears
now
trickled
down
from
his
eyes
which
he
slowly
shut
and
opened
his
colossal
frame
shivered
convulsively
and
falling
on
his
side
he
expired
gordon
cumming
so
many
many
times
this
official
report
leaves
one
curiosity
unsatisfied
for
instance
here
is
a
little
paragraph
out
of
the
record
of
a
certain
band
of
thugs
which
has
that
defect
fell
in
with
lall
sing
subahdar
and
his
family
consisting
of
nine
persons
traveled
with
them
two
days
and
the
third
put
them
all
to
death
except
the
two
children
little
boys
of
one
and
a
half
years
old
there
it
stops
what
did
they
do
with
those
poor
little
fellows
what
was
their
subsequent
history
did
they
purpose
training
them
up
as
thugs
how
could
they
take
care
of
such
little
creatures
on
a
march
which
stretched
over
several
months
no
one
seems
to
have
cared
to
ask
any
questions
about
the
babies
but
i
do
wish
i
knew
one
would
be
apt
to
imagine
that
the
thugs
were
utterly
callous
utterly
destitute
of
human
feelings
heartless
toward
their
own
families
as
well
as
toward
other
people
but
this
was
not
so
like
all
other
indians
they
had
a
passionate
love
for
their
kin
a
shrewd
british
officer
who
knew
the
indian
character
took
that
characteristic
into
account
in
laying
his
plans
for
the
capture
of
eugene
sue
famous
feringhea
he
found
out
feringhea
and
sent
a
guard
by
night
to
seize
him
but
the
squad
was
awkward
and
he
got
away
however
they
got
the
rest
of
the
family
the
mother
wife
child
and
brother
and
brought
them
to
the
officer
at
jubbulpore
the
officer
did
not
fret
but
bided
his
time
i
knew
feringhea
would
not
go
far
while
links
so
dear
to
him
were
in
my
hands
he
was
right
feringhea
knew
all
the
danger
he
was
running
by
staying
in
the
neighborhood
still
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
the
officer
found
that
he
divided
his
time
between
five
villages
where
be
had
relatives
and
friends
who
could
get
news
for
him
from
his
family
in
jubbulpore
jail
and
that
he
never
slept
two
consecutive
nights
in
the
same
village
the
officer
traced
out
his
several
haunts
then
pounced
upon
all
the
five
villages
on
the
one
night
and
at
the
same
hour
and
got
his
man
another
example
of
family
affection
a
little
while
previously
to
the
capture
of
feringhea
family
the
british
officer
had
captured
feringhea
leader
of
a
gang
of
ten
and
had
tried
the
eleven
and
condemned
them
to
be
hanged
feringhea
captured
family
arrived
at
the
jail
the
day
before
the
execution
was
to
take
place
the
jhurhoo
entreated
to
be
allowed
to
see
the
aged
mother
and
the
others
the
prayer
was
granted
and
this
is
what
took
place
it
is
the
british
officer
who
speaks
in
the
morning
just
before
going
to
the
scaffold
the
interview
took
place
before
me
he
fell
at
the
old
woman
feet
and
begged
that
she
would
relieve
him
from
the
obligations
of
the
milk
with
which
she
had
nourished
him
from
infancy
as
he
was
about
to
die
before
he
could
fulfill
any
of
them
she
placed
her
hands
on
his
head
and
he
knelt
and
she
said
she
forgave
him
all
and
bid
him
die
like
a
man
if
a
capable
artist
should
make
a
picture
of
it
it
would
be
full
of
dignity
and
solemnity
and
pathos
and
it
could
touch
you
you
would
imagine
it
to
be
anything
but
what
it
was
there
is
reverence
there
and
tenderness
and
gratefulness
and
compassion
and
resignation
and
fortitude
and
and
no
sense
of
disgrace
no
thought
of
dishonor
everything
is
there
that
goes
to
make
a
noble
parting
and
give
it
a
moving
grace
and
beauty
and
dignity
and
yet
one
of
these
people
is
a
thug
and
the
other
a
mother
of
thugs
the
incongruities
of
our
human
nature
seem
to
reach
their
limit
here
i
wish
to
make
note
of
one
curious
thing
while
i
think
of
it
one
of
the
very
commonest
remarks
to
be
found
in
this
bewildering
array
of
thug
confessions
is
this
strangled
him
and
threw
him
an
a
well
in
one
case
they
threw
sixteen
into
a
well
and
they
had
thrown
others
in
the
same
well
before
it
makes
a
body
thirsty
to
read
about
it
and
there
is
another
very
curious
thing
the
bands
of
thugs
had
private
graveyards
they
did
not
like
to
kill
and
bury
at
random
here
and
there
and
everywhere
they
preferred
to
wait
and
toll
the
victims
along
and
get
to
one
of
their
regular
if
they
could
in
the
little
kingdom
of
oude
which
was
about
half
as
big
as
ireland
and
about
as
big
as
the
state
of
maine
they
had
two
hundred
and
they
were
scattered
along
fourteen
hundred
miles
of
road
at
an
average
of
only
five
miles
apart
and
the
british
government
traced
out
and
located
each
and
every
one
of
them
and
set
them
down
on
the
map
the
oude
bands
seldom
went
out
of
their
own
country
but
they
did
a
thriving
business
within
its
borders
so
did
outside
bands
who
came
in
and
helped
some
of
the
thug
leaders
of
oude
were
noted
for
their
successful
careers
each
of
four
of
them
confessed
to
above
murders
another
to
nearly
our
friend
ramzam
to
he
is
the
one
who
got
leave
of
absence
to
attend
a
wedding
and
went
thugging
instead
and
he
is
also
the
one
who
betrayed
buhram
to
the
british
but
the
biggest
records
of
all
were
the
of
futty
khan
and
buhram
futty
khan
number
is
smaller
than
ramzam
but
he
is
placed
at
the
head
because
his
average
is
the
best
in
history
per
year
of
service
his
slaughter
was
men
in
twenty
years
and
he
was
still
a
young
man
when
the
british
stopped
his
industry
buhram
list
was
murders
but
it
took
him
forty
years
his
average
was
one
man
and
nearly
all
of
another
man
per
month
for
forty
years
but
futty
khan
average
was
two
men
and
a
little
of
another
man
per
month
during
his
twenty
years
of
usefulness
there
is
one
very
striking
thing
which
i
wish
to
call
attention
to
you
have
surmised
from
the
listed
callings
followed
by
the
victims
of
the
thugs
that
nobody
could
travel
the
indian
roads
unprotected
and
live
to
get
through
that
the
thugs
respected
no
quality
no
vocation
no
religion
nobody
that
they
killed
every
unarmed
man
that
came
in
their
way
that
is
wholly
true
with
one
reservation
in
all
the
long
file
of
thug
confessions
an
english
traveler
is
mentioned
but
once
and
this
is
what
the
thug
says
of
the
circumstance
he
was
on
his
way
from
mhow
to
bombay
we
studiously
avoided
him
he
proceeded
next
morning
with
a
number
of
travelers
who
had
sought
his
protection
and
they
took
the
road
to
baroda
we
do
not
know
who
he
was
he
flits
across
the
page
of
this
rusty
old
book
and
disappears
in
the
obscurity
beyond
but
he
is
an
impressive
figure
moving
through
that
valley
of
death
serene
and
unafraid
clothed
in
the
might
of
the
english
name
we
have
now
followed
the
big
official
book
through
and
we
understand
what
thuggee
was
what
a
bloody
terror
it
was
what
a
desolating
scourge
it
was
in
the
english
found
this
cancerous
organization
imbedded
in
the
vitals
of
the
empire
doing
its
devastating
work
in
secrecy
and
assisted
protected
sheltered
and
hidden
by
innumerable
confederates
big
and
little
native
chiefs
customs
officers
village
officials
and
native
police
all
ready
to
lie
for
it
and
the
mass
of
the
people
through
fear
persistently
pretending
to
know
nothing
about
its
doings
and
this
condition
of
things
had
existed
for
generations
and
was
formidable
with
the
sanctions
of
age
and
old
custom
if
ever
there
was
an
unpromising
task
if
ever
there
was
a
hopeless
task
in
the
world
surely
it
was
offered
here
the
task
of
conquering
thuggee
but
that
little
handful
of
english
officials
in
india
set
their
sturdy
and
confident
grip
upon
it
and
ripped
it
out
root
and
branch
how
modest
do
captain
vallancey
words
sound
now
when
we
read
them
again
knowing
what
we
know
the
day
that
sees
this
evil
completely
eradicated
from
india
and
known
only
in
name
will
greatly
tend
to
immortalize
british
rule
in
the
east
it
would
be
hard
to
word
a
claim
more
modestly
than
that
for
this
most
noble
work
chapter
xlviii
grief
can
take
care
of
itself
but
to
get
the
full
value
of
a
joy
you
must
have
somebody
to
divide
it
with
wilson
new
calendar
we
left
bombay
for
allahabad
by
a
night
train
it
is
the
custom
of
the
country
to
avoid
day
travel
when
it
can
conveniently
be
done
but
there
is
one
trouble
while
you
can
seemingly
secure
the
two

making

you
come
all
will
be
well
but
if
they
step
aside
on
an
errand
they
may
find
the
beds
promoted
to
the
two
shelves
and
somebody
else
demons
standing
guard
over
their
beds
which
in
the
meantime
have
been
spread
upon
your
sofas
you
do
not
pay
anything
extra
for
your
sleeping
place
that
is
where
the
trouble
lies
if
you
buy
a
and
fail
to
use
it
there
is
room
thus
made
available
for
someone
else
but
if
the
place
were
secured
to
you
it
would
remain
vacant
and
yet
your
ticket
would
secure
you
another
place
when
you
were
presently
ready
to
travel
however
no
explanation
of
such
a
system
can
make
it
seem
quite
rational
to
a
person
who
has
been
used
to
a
more
rational
system
if
our
people
had
the
arranging
of
it
we
should
charge
extra
for
securing
the
place
and
then
the
road
would
suffer
no
loss
if
the
purchaser
did
not
occupy
it
the
present
system
encourages
good
manners
and
also
discourages
them
if
a
young
girl
has
a
lower
berth
and
an
elderly
lady
comes
in
it
is
usual
for
the
girl
to
offer
her
place
to
this
late
comer
and
it
is
usual
for
the
late
comer
to
thank
her
courteously
and
take
it
but
the
thing
happens
differently
sometimes
when
we
were
ready
to
leave
bombay
my
daughter
satchels
were
holding
possession
of
her
berth
a
lower
one
at
the
last
moment
a
american
lady
swarmed
into
the
compartment
followed
by
native
porters
laden
with
her
baggage
she
was
growling
and
snarling
and
scolding
and
trying
to
make
herself
phenomenally
disagreeable
and
succeeding
without
a
word
she
hoisted
the
satchels
into
the
hanging
shelf
and
took
possession
of
that
lower
berth
on
one
of
our
trips
smythe
and
i
got
out
at
a
station
to
walk
up
and
down
and
when
we
came
back
smythe
bed
was
in
the
hanging
shelf
and
an
english
cavalry
officer
was
in
bed
on
the
sofa
which
he
had
lately
been
occupying
it
was
mean
to
be
glad
about
it
but
it
is
the
way
we
are
made
i
could
not
have
been
gladder
if
it
had
been
my
enemy
that
had
suffered
this
misfortune
we
all
like
to
see
people
in
trouble
if
it
does
cost
us
anything
i
was
so
happy
over
smythe
chagrin
that
i
could
go
to
sleep
for
thinking
of
it
and
enjoying
it
i
knew
he
supposed
the
officer
had
committed
the
robbery
himself
whereas
without
a
doubt
the
officer
servant
had
done
it
without
his
knowledge
smythe
kept
this
incident
warm
in
his
heart
and
longed
for
a
chance
to
get
even
with
somebody
for
it
sometime
afterward
the
opportunity
came
in
calcutta
we
were
leaving
on
a
journey
to
darjeeling
barclay
the
general
superintendent
has
made
special
provision
for
our
accommodation
smythe
said
so
there
was
no
need
to
hurry
about
getting
to
the
train
consequently
we
were
a
little
late
when
we
arrived
the
usual
immense
turmoil
and
confusion
of
a
great
indian
station
were
in
full
blast
it
was
an
immoderately
long
train
for
all
the
natives
of
india
were
going
by
it
somewhither
and
the
native
officials
were
being
pestered
to
frenzy
by
belated
and
anxious
people
they
did
know
where
our
car
was
and
could
remember
having
received
any
orders
about
it
it
was
a
deep
disappointment
moreover
it
looked
as
if
our
half
of
our
party
would
be
left
behind
altogether
then
satan
came
running
and
said
he
had
found
a
compartment
with
one
shelf
and
one
sofa
unoccupied
and
had
made
our
beds
and
had
stowed
our
baggage
we
rushed
to
the
place
and
just
as
the
train
was
ready
to
pull
out
and
the
porters
were
slamming
the
doors
to
all
down
the
line
an
officer
of
the
indian
civil
service
a
good
friend
of
ours
put
his
head
in
and
said
i
have
been
hunting
for
you
everywhere
what
are
you
doing
here
you
know
the
train
started
before
he
could
finish
smythe
opportunity
was
come
his
bedding
on
the
shelf
at
once
changed
places
with
the
bedding
a
stranger
that
was
occupying
the
sofa
that
was
opposite
to
mine
about
ten
we
stopped
somewhere
and
a
large
englishman
of
official
military
bearing
stepped
in
we
pretended
to
be
asleep
the
lamps
were
covered
but
there
was
light
enough
for
us
to
note
his
look
of
surprise
he
stood
there
grand
and
fine
peering
down
at
smythe
and
wondering
in
silence
at
the
situation
after
a
bit
be
said
well
and
that
was
all
but
that
was
enough
it
was
easy
to
understand
it
meant
this
is
extraordinary
this
is
i
have
had
an
experience
like
this
before
he
sat
down
on
his
baggage
and
for
twenty
minutes
we
watched
him
through
our
eyelashes
rocking
and
swaying
there
to
the
motion
of
the
train
then
we
came
to
a
station
and
he
got
up
and
went
out
muttering
i
must
find
a
lower
berth
or
wait
over
his
servant
came
presently
and
carried
away
his
things
smythe
sore
place
was
healed
his
hunger
for
revenge
was
satisfied
but
he
could
sleep
and
neither
could
i
for
this
was
a
venerable
old
car
and
nothing
about
it
was
taut
the
closet
door
slammed
all
night
and
defied
every
fastening
we
could
invent
we
got
up
very
much
jaded
at
dawn
and
stepped
out
at
a
way
station
and
while
we
were
taking
a
cup
of
coffee
that
englishman
ranged
up
alongside
and
somebody
said
to
him
so
you
did
stop
off
after
all
no
the
guard
found
a
place
for
me
that
had
been
engaged
and
not
occupied
i
had
a
whole
saloon
car
all
to
myself
oh
quite
palatial
i
never
had
such
luck
in
my
life
that
was
our
car
you
see
we
moved
into
it
straight
off
the
family
and
all
but
i
asked
the
english
gentleman
to
remain
and
he
did
a
pleasant
man
an
infantry
colonel
and
does
know
yet
that
smythe
robbed
him
of
his
berth
but
thinks
it
was
done
by
smythe
servant
without
smythe
knowledge
he
was
assisted
in
gathering
this
impression
the
indian
trains
are
manned
by
natives
exclusively
the
indian
stations
except
very
large
and
important
ones
are
manned
entirely
by
natives
and
so
are
the
posts
and
telegraphs
the
rank
and
file
of
the
police
are
natives
all
these
people
are
pleasant
and
accommodating
one
day
i
left
an
express
train
to
lounge
about
in
that
perennially
ravishing
show
the
ebb
and
flow
and
whirl
of
gaudy
natives
that
is
always
surging
up
and
down
the
spacious
platform
of
a
great
indian
station
and
i
lost
myself
in
the
ecstasy
of
it
and
when
i
turned
the
train
was
moving
swiftly
away
i
was
going
to
sit
down
and
wait
for
another
train
as
i
would
have
done
at
home
i
had
no
thought
of
any
other
course
but
a
native
official
who
had
a
green
flag
in
his
hand
saw
me
and
said
politely
do
you
belong
in
the
train
sir
yes
i
said
he
waved
his
flag
and
the
train
came
back
and
he
put
me
aboard
with
as
much
ceremony
as
if
i
had
been
the
general
superintendent
they
are
kindly
people
the
natives
the
face
and
the
bearing
that
indicate
a
surly
spirit
and
a
bad
heart
seemed
to
me
to
be
so
rare
among
indians
so
nearly
in
fact
that
i
sometimes
wondered
if
thuggee
a
dream
and
not
a
reality
the
bad
hearts
are
there
but
i
believe
that
they
are
in
a
small
poor
minority
one
thing
is
sure
they
are
much
the
most
interesting
people
in
the
world
and
the
nearest
to
being
incomprehensible
at
any
rate
the
hardest
to
account
for
their
character
and
their
history
their
customs
and
their
religion
confront
you
with
riddles
at
every
which
are
a
trifle
more
perplexing
after
they
are
explained
than
they
were
before
you
can
get
the
facts
of
a
custom
like
caste
and
suttee
and
thuggee
and
so
on
and
with
the
facts
a
theory
which
tries
to
explain
but
never
quite
does
it
to
your
satisfaction
you
can
never
quite
understand
how
so
strange
a
thing
could
have
been
born
nor
why
for
instance
the
suttee
this
is
the
explanation
of
it
a
woman
who
throws
away
her
life
when
her
husband
dies
is
instantly
joined
to
him
again
and
is
forever
afterward
happy
with
him
in
heaven
her
family
will
build
a
little
monument
to
her
or
a
temple
and
will
hold
her
in
honor
and
indeed
worship
her
memory
always
they
will
themselves
be
held
in
honor
by
the
public
the
woman
has
conferred
a
noble
and
lasting
distinction
upon
her
posterity
and
besides
see
what
she
has
escaped
if
she
had
elected
to
live
she
would
be
a
disgraced
person
she
could
not
remarry
her
family
would
despise
her
and
disown
her
she
would
be
a
friendless
outcast
and
miserable
all
her
days
very
well
you
say
but
the
explanation
is
not
complete
yet
how
did
people
come
to
drift
into
such
a
strange
custom
what
was
the
origin
of
the
idea
well
nobody
knows
it
was
probably
a
revelation
sent
down
by
the
gods
one
more
thing
why
was
such
a
cruel
death
chosen
why
would
a
gentle
one
have
answered
nobody
knows
maybe
that
was
a
revelation
too
no
you
can
never
understand
it
it
all
seems
impossible
you
resolve
to
believe
that
a
widow
never
burnt
herself
willingly
but
went
to
her
death
because
she
was
afraid
to
defy
public
opinion
but
you
are
not
able
to
keep
that
position
history
drives
you
from
it
major
sleeman
has
a
convincing
case
in
one
of
his
books
in
his
government
on
the
nerbudda
he
made
a
brave
attempt
on
the
of
march
to
put
down
suttee
on
his
own
hook
and
without
warrant
from
the
supreme
government
of
india
he
could
not
foresee
that
the
government
would
put
it
down
itself
eight
months
later
the
only
backing
he
had
was
a
bold
nature
and
a
compassionate
heart
he
issued
his
proclamation
abolishing
the
suttee
in
his
district
on
the
morning
of
tuesday
note
the
day
of
the
week
the
of
the
following
november
ummed
singh
upadhya
head
of
the
most
respectable
and
most
extensive
brahmin
family
in
the
district
died
and
presently
came
a
deputation
of
his
sons
and
grandsons
to
beg
that
his
old
widow
might
be
allowed
to
burn
herself
upon
his
pyre
sleeman
threatened
to
enforce
his
order
and
punish
severely
any
man
who
assisted
and
he
placed
a
police
guard
to
see
that
no
one
did
so
from
the
early
morning
the
old
widow
of
had
been
sitting
on
the
bank
of
the
sacred
river
by
her
dead
waiting
through
the
long
hours
for
the
permission
and
at
last
the
refusal
came
instead
in
one
little
sentence
sleeman
gives
you
a
pathetic
picture
of
this
lonely
old
gray
figure
all
day
and
all
night
she
remained
sitting
by
the
edge
of
the
water
without
eating
or
drinking
the
next
morning
the
body
of
the
husband
was
burned
to
ashes
in
a
pit
eight
feet
square
and
three
or
four
feet
deep
in
the
view
of
several
thousand
spectators
then
the
widow
waded
out
to
a
bare
rock
in
the
river
and
everybody
went
away
but
her
sons
and
other
relations
all
day
she
sat
there
on
her
rock
in
the
blazing
sun
without
food
or
drink
and
with
no
clothing
but
a
sheet
over
her
shoulders
the
relatives
remained
with
her
and
all
tried
to
persuade
her
to
desist
from
her
purpose
for
they
deeply
loved
her
she
steadily
refused
then
a
part
of
the
family
went
to
sleeman
house
ten
miles
away
and
tried
again
to
get
him
to
let
her
burn
herself
he
refused
hoping
to
save
her
yet
all
that
day
she
scorched
in
her
sheet
on
the
rock
and
all
that
night
she
kept
her
vigil
there
in
the
bitter
cold
thursday
morning
in
the
sight
of
her
relatives
she
went
through
a
ceremonial
which
said
more
to
them
than
any
words
could
have
done
she
put
on
the
dhaja
a
coarse
red
turban
and
broke
her
bracelets
in
pieces
by
these
acts
she
became
a
dead
person
in
the
eye
of
the
law
and
excluded
from
her
caste
forever
by
the
iron
rule
of
ancient
custom
if
she
should
now
choose
to
live
she
could
never
return
to
her
family
sleeman
was
in
deep
trouble
if
she
starved
herself
to
death
her
family
would
be
disgraced
and
moreover
starving
would
be
a
more
lingering
misery
than
the
death
by
fire
he
went
back
in
the
evening
thoroughly
worried
the
old
woman
remained
on
her
rock
and
there
in
the
morning
he
found
her
with
her
dhaja
still
on
her
head
she
talked
very
collectedly
telling
me
that
she
had
determined
to
mix
her
ashes
with
those
of
her
departed
husband
and
should
patiently
wait
my
permission
to
do
so
assured
that
god
would
enable
her
to
sustain
life
till
that
was
given
though
she
dared
not
eat
or
drink
looking
at
the
sun
then
rising
before
her
over
a
long
and
beautiful
reach
of
the
river
she
said
calmly
soul
has
been
for
five
days
with
my
husband
near
that
sun
nothing
but
my
earthly
frame
is
left
and
this
i
know
you
will
in
time
suffer
to
be
mixed
with
his
ashes
in
yonder
pit
because
it
is
not
in
your
nature
or
usage
wantonly
to
prolong
the
miseries
of
a
poor
old
woman
he
assured
her
that
it
was
his
desire
and
duty
to
save
her
and
to
urge
her
to
live
and
to
keep
her
family
from
the
disgrace
of
being
thought
her
murderers
but
she
said
she
was
not
afraid
of
their
being
thought
so
that
they
had
all
like
good
children
done
everything
in
their
power
to
induce
her
to
live
and
to
abide
with
them
and
if
i
should
consent
i
know
they
would
love
and
honor
me
but
my
duties
to
them
have
now
ended
i
commit
them
all
to
your
care
and
i
go
to
attend
my
husband
ummed
singh
upadhya
with
whose
ashes
on
the
funeral
pile
mine
have
been
already
three
times
mixed
she
believed
that
she
and
he
had
been
upon
the
earth
three
several
times
as
wife
and
husband
and
that
she
had
burned
herself
to
death
three
times
upon
his
pyre
that
is
why
she
said
that
strange
thing
since
she
had
broken
her
bracelets
and
put
on
the
red
turban
she
regarded
herself
as
a
corpse
otherwise
she
would
not
have
allowed
herself
to
do
her
husband
the
irreverence
of
pronouncing
his
name
this
was
the
first
time
in
her
long
life
that
she
had
ever
uttered
her
husband
name
for
in
india
no
woman
high
or
low
ever
pronounces
the
name
of
her
husband
major
sleeman
still
tried
to
shake
her
purpose
he
promised
to
build
her
a
fine
house
among
the
temples
of
her
ancestors
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
and
make
handsome
provision
for
her
out
of
lands
if
she
would
consent
to
live
and
if
she
would
he
would
allow
no
stone
or
brick
to
ever
mark
the
place
where
she
died
but
she
only
smiled
and
said
my
pulse
has
long
ceased
to
beat
my
spirit
has
departed
i
shall
suffer
nothing
in
the
burning
and
if
you
wish
proof
order
some
fire
and
you
shall
see
this
arm
consumed
without
giving
me
any
pain
sleeman
was
now
satisfied
that
he
could
not
alter
her
purpose
he
sent
for
all
the
chief
members
of
the
family
and
said
he
would
suffer
her
to
burn
herself
if
they
would
enter
into
a
written
engagement
to
abandon
the
suttee
in
their
family
thenceforth
they
agreed
the
papers
were
drawn
out
and
signed
and
at
noon
saturday
word
was
sent
to
the
poor
old
woman
she
seemed
greatly
pleased
the
ceremonies
of
bathing
were
gone
through
with
and
by
three
she
was
ready
and
the
fire
was
briskly
burning
in
the
pit
she
had
now
gone
without
food
or
drink
during
more
than
four
days
and
a
half
she
came
ashore
from
her
rock
first
wetting
her
sheet
in
the
waters
of
the
sacred
river
for
without
that
safeguard
any
shadow
which
might
fall
upon
her
would
convey
impurity
to
her
then
she
walked
to
the
pit
leaning
upon
one
of
her
sons
and
a
nephew
the
distance
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
i
had
sentries
placed
all
around
and
no
other
person
was
allowed
to
approach
within
five
paces
she
came
on
with
a
calm
and
cheerful
countenance
stopped
once
and
casting
her
eyes
upwards
said
have
they
kept
me
five
days
from
thee
my
husband
on
coming
to
the
sentries
her
supporters
stopped
and
remained
standing
she
moved
on
and
walked
once
around
the
pit
paused
a
moment
and
while
muttering
a
prayer
threw
some
flowers
into
the
fire
she
then
walked
up
deliberately
and
steadily
to
the
brink
stepped
into
the
centre
of
the
flame
sat
down
and
leaning
back
in
the
midst
as
if
reposing
upon
a
couch
was
consumed
without
uttering
a
shriek
or
betraying
one
sign
of
agony
it
is
fine
and
beautiful
it
compels
one
reverence
and
respect
no
has
it
freely
and
without
compulsion
we
see
how
the
custom
once
started
could
continue
for
the
soul
of
it
is
that
stupendous
power
faith
faith
brought
to
the
pitch
of
effectiveness
by
the
cumulative
force
of
example
and
long
use
and
custom
but
we
can
not
understand
how
the
first
widows
came
to
take
to
it
that
is
a
perplexing
detail
sleeman
says
that
it
was
usual
to
play
music
at
the
suttee
but
that
the

notion
that
this
was
to
drown
the
screams
of
the
martyr
is
not
correct
that
it
had
a
quite
different
purpose
it
was
believed
that
the
martyr
died
prophecying
that
the
prophecies
sometimes
foretold
disaster
and
it
was
considered
a
kindness
to
those
upon
whom
it
was
to
fall
to
drown
the
voice
and
keep
them
in
ignorance
of
the
misfortune

was

two

one

it
was

and
it

the

travel
promised
to

that

the
pyjamas
in
order
to
be
in

but
i
was
obliged
to
give
them
up
i
could
stand
them
there
was
no

to
i
missed
the
refreshing

induced
by
the
of
being
undressed
emancipated
set
free
from
restraints

in

of
that
i
had
the

suffocated
sense
of
being
abed
with
my
clothes
on
all
through
the
warm
half
of
the
night
the
coarse
surfaces
irritated
my
skin

made
it
feel
baked
and
feverish
and
the
dreams
which
came
in

fitful

of
slumber
were
such
as

the

of
the

ought
to
and
all
through
the
cold
other
half
of
the
night
i
could
get
no

for

because
i
had
to

blankets
are
of
no
value
at
such
a
time
the
higher
they
are
piled
the
more
effectively
they
cork
the
cold
in
and
keep
it
from
getting
out
the
result
is
that
your
legs
are
ice
and
you
know
how
you
will
feel
by
and
by
when
you
are
buried
in
a
sane
interval
i
discarded
the
pyjamas
and
led
a
rational
and
comfortable
life
thenceforth
out
in
the
country
in
india
the
day
begins
early
one
sees
a
plain
perfectly
flat
and
stretching
limitlessly
away
on
every
side
in
the
dim
gray
light
striped
everywhere
with
narrow
paths
the
vast
flatness
broken
at
wide
intervals
by
bunches
of
spectral
trees
that
mark
where
villages
are
and
along
all
the
paths
are
slender
women
and
the
black
forms
of
lanky
naked
men
moving
to
their
work
the
women
with
brass
on
their
heads
the
men
carrying
hoes
the
man
is
not
entirely
naked
always
there
is
a
bit
of
white
rag
a
it
amounts
to
a
bandage
and
is
a
white
accent
on
his
black
person
like
the
silver
band
around
the
middle
of
a
sometimes
he
also
wears
a
fluffy
and
voluminous
white
turban
and
this
adds
a
second
accent
he
then
answers
properly
to

picture
of
him
as
a
person
who
is
dressed
in
a
turban
and
a
pocket
handkerchief
all
day
long
one
has
this
monotony
of
dead
levels
and
scattering
bunches
of
trees
and
mud
villages
you
soon
realize
that
india
is
not
beautiful
still
there
is
an
enchantment
about
it
that
is
beguiling
and
which
does
not
pall
you
can
not
tell
just
what
it
is
that
makes
the
spell
perhaps
but
you
feel
it
and
confess
it
nevertheless
of
course
at
bottom
you
know
in
a
vague
way
that
it
is
history
it
is
that
that
affects
you
a
haunting
sense
of
the
myriads
of
human
lives
that
have
blossomed
and
withered
and
perished
here
repeating
and
repeating
and
repeating
century
after
century
and
age
after
age
the
barren
and
meaningless
process
it
is
this
sense
that
gives
to
this
forlorn
uncomely
land
power
to
speak
to
the
spirit
and
make
friends
with
it
to
speak
to
it
with
a
voice
bitter
with
satire
but
eloquent
with
melancholy
the
deserts
of
australia
and
the
of
greenland
have
no
speech
for
they
have
no
venerable
history
with
nothing
to
tell
of
man
and
his
vanities
his
fleeting
glories
and
his
miseries
they
have
nothing
wherewith
to
spiritualize
their
ugliness
and
veil
it
with
a
charm
there
is
nothing
pretty
about
an
indian
village
a
mud
one
and
i
do
not
remember
that
we
saw
any
but
mud
ones
on
that
long
flight
to
allahabad
it
is
a
little
bunch
of
mud
hovels
jammed
together
within
a
mud
wall
as
a
rule
the
rains
had
beaten
down
parts
of
some
of
the
houses
and
this
gave
the
village
the
aspect
of
a
mouldering
and
hoary
ruin
i
believe
the
cattle
and
the
vermin
live
inside
the
wall
for
i
saw
cattle
coming
out
and
cattle
going
in
and
whenever
i
saw
a
villager
he
was
scratching
this
last
is
only
circumstantial
evidence
but
i
think
it
has
value
the
village
has
a
battered
little
temple
or
two
big
enough
to
hold
an
idol
and
with
custom
enough
to
a
priest
and
keep
him
comfortable
where
there
are
mohammedans
there
are
generally
a
few
sorry
tombs
outside
the
village
that
have
a
decayed
and
neglected
look
the
villages
interested
me
because
of
things
which
major
sleeman
says
about
them
in
his
books
particularly
what
he
says
about
the
division
of
labor
in
them
he
says
that
the
whole
face
of
india
is
parceled
out
into
estates
of
villages
that
of
the
vast
population
of
the
land
consist
of
cultivators
of
the
soil
that
it
is
these
cultivators
who
inhabit
the
villages
that
there
are
certain
established
village
servants
mechanics
and
others
who
are
apparently
paid
a
wage
by
the
village
at
large
and
whose
callings
remain
in
certain
families
and
are
handed
down
from
father
to
son
like
an
estate
he
gives
a
list
of
these
established
servants
priest
blacksmith
carpenter
accountant
washerman
basketmaker
potter
watchman
barber
shoemaker
brazier
confectioner
weaver
dyer
etc
in
his
day
witches
abounded
and
it
was
not
thought
good
business
wisdom
for
a
man
to
marry
his
daughter
into
a
family
that
had
a
witch
in
it
for
she
would
need
a
witch
on
the
premises
to
protect
her
children
from
the
evil
spells
which
would
certainly
be
cast
upon
them
by
the
witches
connected
with
the
neighboring
families
the
office
of
midwife
was
hereditary
in
the
family
of
the
it
belonged
to
his
wife
she
might
not
be
competent
but
the
office
was
hers
anyway
her
pay
was
not
high
cents
for
a
boy
and
half
as
much
for
a
girl
the
girl
was
not
desired
because
she
would
be
a
disastrous
expense
by
and
by
as
soon
as
she
should
be
old
enough
to
begin
to
wear
clothes
for
propriety
sake
it
would
be
a
disgrace
to
the
family
if
she
were
not
married
and
to
marry
her
meant
financial
ruin
for
by
custom
the
father
must
spend
upon
feasting
and
everything
he
had
and
all
he
could
borrow
in
fact
reduce
himself
to
a
condition
of
poverty
which
he
might
never
more
recover
from
it
was
the
dread
of
this
prospective
ruin
which
made
the
killing
of
so
prevalent
in
india
in
the
old
days
before
england
laid
the
iron
hand
of
her
prohibitions
upon
the
piteous
slaughter
one
may
judge
of
how
prevalent
the
custom
was
by
one
of
sleeman
casual
electrical
remarks
when
he
speaks
of
children
at
play
in
villages
where
were
never
heard
the
folly
is
still
in
full
force
in
india
and
by
consequence
the
destruction
of
is
still
furtively
practiced
but
not
largely
because
of
the
vigilance
of
the
government
and
the
sternness
of
the
penalties
it
levies
in
some
parts
of
india
the
village
keeps
in
its
pay
three
other
servants
an
astrologer
to
tell
the
villager
when
he
may
plant
his
crop
or
make
a
journey
or
marry
a
wife
or
strangle
a
child
or
borrow
a
dog
or
climb
a
tree
or
catch
a
rat
or
swindle
a
neighbor
without
offending
the
alert
and
solicitous
heavens
and
what
his
dream
means
if
he
has
had
one
and
was
not
bright
enough
to
interpret
it
himself
by
the
details
of
his
dinner
the
two
other
established
servants
were
the
and
the
hailstorm
discourager
the
one
kept
away
the
tigers
if
he
could
and
collected
the
wages
anyway
and
the
other
kept
off
the
hailstorms
or
explained
why
he
failed
he
charged
the
same
for
explaining
a
failure
that
he
did
for
scoring
a
success
a
man
is
an
idiot
who
ca

a
living
in
india
major
sleeman
reveals
the
fact
that
the
trade
union
and
the
boycott
are
antiquities
in
india
india
seems
to
have
originated
everything
the
sweeper
belongs
to
the
bottom
caste
he
is
the
lowest
of
the
low
all
other
castes
despise
him
and
scorn
his
office
but
that
does
not
trouble
him
his
caste
is
a
caste
and
that
is
sufficient
for
him
and
so
he
is
proud
of
it
not
ashamed
sleeman
says
it
is
perhaps
not
known
to
many
of
my
countrymen
even
in
india
that
in
every
town
and
city
in
the
country
the
right
of
sweeping
the
houses
and
streets
is
a
monopoly
and
is
supported
entirely
by
the
pride
of
castes
among
the
scavengers
who
are
all
of
the
lowest
class
the
right
of
sweeping
within
a
certain
range
is
recognized
by
the
caste
to
belong
to
a
certain
member
and
if
any
other
member
presumes
to
sweep
within
that
range
he
is
excommunicated
no
other
member
will
smoke
out
of
his
pipe
or
drink
out
of
his
jug
and
he
can
get
restored
to
caste
only
by
a
feast
to
the
whole
body
of
sweepers
if
any
housekeeper
within
a
particular
circle
happens
to
offend
the
sweeper
of
that
range
none
of
his
filth
will
be
removed
till
he
pacifies
him
because
no
other
sweeper
will
dare
to
touch
it
and
the
people
of
a
town
are
often
more
tyrannized
over
by
these
people
than
by
any
other
a
footnote
by
major
sleeman
editor
vincent
arthur
smith
says
that
in
our
day
this
tyranny
of
the
sweepers
guild
is
one
of
the
many
difficulties
which
bar
the
progress
of
indian
sanitary
reform
think
of
this
the
sweepers
can
not
be
readily
coerced
because
no
hindoo
or
mussulman
would
do
their
work
to
save
his
life
nor
will
he
pollute
himself
by
beating
the
refractory
scavenger
they
certainly
do
seem
to
have
the
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
more
impregnable
position
the
vested
rights
described
in
the
text
are
so
fully
recognized
in
practice
that
they
are
frequently
the
subject
of
sale
or
mortgage
just
like
a
or
like
a
london
it
is
said
that
the
london
right
to
his
crossing
is
recognized
by
the
rest
of
the
guild
that
they
protect
him
in
its
possession
that
certain
choice
crossings
are
valuable
property
and
are
saleable
at
high
figures
i
have
noticed
that
the
man
who
sweeps
in
front
of
the
army
and
navy
stores
has
a
wealthy
south
african
aristocratic
style
about
him
and
when
he
is
off
his
guard
he
has
exactly
that
look
on
his
face
which
you
always
see
in
the
face
of
a
man
who
has
is
saving
up
his
daughter
to
marry
her
to
a
duke
it
appears
from
sleeman
that
in
india
the
occupation
of
is
confined
to
mohammedans
i
wonder
why
that
is
the
is
a
mohammedan
but
it
is
said
that
the
reason
of
that
is
that
the
hindoo
religion
does
not
allow
him
to
touch
the
skin
of
dead
kine
and
that
is
what
the
is
made
of
it
would
defile
him
and
it
does
allow
him
to
eat
meat
the
animal
that
furnished
the
meat
was
murdered
and
to
take
any
creature
life
is
a
sin
it
is
a
good
and
gentle
religion
but
inconvenient
a
great
indian
river
at
low
water
suggests
the
familiar
anatomical
picture
of
a
skinned
human
body
the
intricate
mesh
of
interwoven
muscles
and
tendons
to
stand
for
and
the
archipelagoes
of
fat
and
flesh
inclosed
by
them
to
stand
for
the
sandbars
somewhere
on
this
journey
we
passed
such
a
river
and
on
a
later
journey
we
saw
in
the
sutlej
the
duplicate
of
that
river
curious
rivers
they
are
low
shores
a
dizzy
distance
apart
with
nothing
between
but
an
enormous
acreage
of
with
sluggish
little
veins
of
water
dribbling
around
amongst
them
saharas
of
sand
with
footprints
punctured
in
belts
as
straight
as
the
equator
clear
from
the
one
shore
to
the
other
barring
the
a
ferry
you
see
long
railway
bridges
are
required
for
this
sort
of
rivers
and
india
has
them
you
approach
allahabad
by
a
very
long
one
it
was
now
carrying
us
across
the
bed
of
the
jumna
a
bed
which
did
not
seem
to
have
been
slept
in
for
one
while
or
more
it
was
all
most
of
it
was
overflow
ground
allahabad
means
city
of
god
i
get
this
from
the
books
from
a
printed
curiosity
a
letter
written
by
one
of
those
brave
and
confident
hindoo
strugglers
with
the
english
tongue
called
a
babu
i
got
a
more
compressed
translation
godville
it
is
perfectly
correct
but
that
is
the
most
that
can
be
said
for
it
we
arrived
in
the
forenoon
and
for
satan
got
left
behind
somewhere
that
morning
and
did
not
overtake
us
until
after
nightfall
it
seemed
very
peaceful
without
him
the
world
seemed
asleep
and
dreaming
i
did
not
see
the
native
town
i
think
i
do
not
remember
why
for
an
incident
connects
it
with
the
great
mutiny
and
that
is
enough
to
make
any
place
interesting
but
i
saw
the
english
part
of
the
city
it
is
a
town
of
wide
avenues
and
noble
distances
and
is
comely
and
alluring
and
full
of
suggestions
of
comfort
and
leisure
and
of
the
serenity
which
a
good
conscience
buttressed
by
a
sufficient
bank
account
gives
the
bungalows
dwellings
stand
well
back
in
the
seclusion
and
privacy
of
large
enclosed
compounds
private
grounds
as
we
should
say
and
in
the
shade
and
shelter
of
trees
even
the
photographer
and
the
prosperous
merchant
ply
their
industries
in
the
elegant
reserve
of
big
compounds
and
the
citizens
drive
in
thereupon
their
business
occasions
and
not
in
cabs
no
in
the
indian
cities
cabs
are
for
the
drifting
stranger
all
the
white
citizens
have
private
carriages
and
each
carriage
has
a
flock
of
black
footmen
and
drivers
all
over
it
the
vicinity
of
a
looks
like
a
snowstorm
and
makes
the
lecturer
feel
like
an
opera
india
has
many
names
and
they
are
correctly
descriptive
it
is
the
land
of
contradictions
the
land
of
subtlety
and
superstition
the
land
of
wealth
and
poverty
the
land
of
splendor
and
desolation
the
land
of
plague
and
famine
the
land
of
the
thug
and
the
poisoner
and
of
the
meek
and
the
patient
the
land
of
the
suttee
the
land
of
the
unreinstatable
widow
the
land
where
all
life
is
holy
the
land
of
cremation
the
land
where
the
vulture
is
a
grave
and
a
monument
the
land
of
the
multitudinous
gods
and
if
signs
go
for
anything
it
is
the
land
of
the
private
carriage
in
bombay
the
forewoman
of
a
millinery
shop
came
to
the
hotel
in
her
private
carriage
to
take
the
measure
for
a
gown
not
for
me
but
for
another
she
had
come
out
to
india
to
make
a
temporary
stay
but
was
extending
it
indefinitely
indeed
she
was
purposing
to
end
her
days
there
in
london
she
said
her
work
had
been
hard
her
hours
long
for
economy
sake
she
had
had
to
live
in
shabby
rooms
and
far
away
from
the
shop
watch
the
pennies
deny
herself
many
of
the
common
comforts
of
life
restrict
herself
in
effect
to
its
bare
necessities
eschew
cabs
travel
by
underground
train
to
and
from
her
work
swallowing
and
cinders
all
the
way
and
sometimes
troubled
with
the
society
of
men
and
women
who
were
less
desirable
than
the
smoke
and
the
cinders
but
in
bombay
on
almost
any
kind
of
wages
she
could
live
in
comfort
and
keep
her
carriage
and
have
six
servants
in
place
of
the
she
had
had
in
her
english
home
later
in
calcutta
i
found
that
the
standard
oil
clerks
had
small
vehicles
and
did
no
walking
and
i
was
told
that
the
clerks
of
the
other
large
concerns
there
had
the
like
equipment
but
to
return
to
allahabad
i
was
up
at
dawn
the
next
morning
in
india
the
tourist
servant
does
not
sleep
in
a
room
in
the
hotel
but
rolls
himself
up
head
and
ears
in
his
blanket
and
stretches
himself
on
the
veranda
across
the
front
of
his
master
door
and
spends
the
night
there
i
do
believe
servant
occupies
a
room
apparently
the
bungalow
servants
sleep
on
the
veranda
it
is
roomy
and
goes
all
around
the
house
i
speak
of
menservants
i
saw
none
of
the
other
sex
i
think
there
are
none
except
i
was
up
at
dawn
and
walked
around
the
veranda
past
the
rows
of
sleepers
in
front
of
one
door
a
hindoo
servant
was
squatting
waiting
for
his
master
to
call
him
he
had
polished
the
yellow
shoes
and
placed
them
by
the
door
and
now
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
wait
it
was
freezing
cold
but
there
he
was
as
motionless
as
a
sculptured
image
and
as
patient
it
troubled
me
i
wanted
to
say
to
him
do
crouch
there
like
that
and
freeze
nobody
requires
it
of
you
stir
around
and
get
warm
but
i
had
the
words
i
thought
of
saying
jow
but
i
could
remember
what
it
meant
so
i
did
say
it
i
knew
another
phrase
but
it
would
come
to
my
mind
i
moved
on
purposing
to
dismiss
him
from
my
thoughts
but
his
bare
legs
and
bare
feet
kept
him
there
they
kept
drawing
me
back
from
the
sunny
side
to
a
point
whence
i
could
see
him
at
the
end
of
an
hour
he
had
not
changed
his
attitude
in
the
least
degree
it
was
a
curious
and
impressive
exhibition
of
meekness
and
patience
or
fortitude
or
indifference
i
did
not
know
which
but
it
worried
me
and
it
was
spoiling
my
morning
in
fact
it
spoiled
two
hours
of
it
quite
thoroughly
i
quitted
this
vicinity
then
and
left
him
to
punish
himself
as
much
as
he
might
want
to
but
up
to
that
time
the
man
had
not
changed
his
attitude
a
hair
he
will
always
remain
with
me
i
suppose
his
figure
never
grows
vague
in
my
memory
whenever
i
read
of
indian
resignation
indian
patience
under
wrongs
hardships
and
misfortunes
he
comes
before
me
he
becomes
a
personification
and
stands
for
india
in
trouble
and
for
untold
ages
india
in
trouble
has
been
pursued
with
the
very
remark
which
i
was
going
to
utter
but
did
because
its
meaning
had
slipped
me
jeddy
jow
come
shove
along
why
it
was
the
very
thing
in
the
early
brightness
we
made
a
long
drive
out
to
the
fort
part
of
the
way
was
beautiful
it
led
under
stately
trees
and
through
groups
of
native
houses
and
by
the
usual
village
well
where
the
picturesque
gangs
are
always
flocking
to
and
fro
and
laughing
and
chattering
and
this
time
brawny
men
were
deluging
their
bronze
bodies
with
the
limpid
water
and
making
a
refreshing
and
enticing
show
of
it
enticing
for
the
sun
was
already
transacting
business
firing
india
up
for
the
day
there
was
plenty
of
this
early
bathing
going
on
for
it
was
getting
toward
breakfast
time
and
with
an
unpurified
body
the
hindoo
must
not
eat
then
we
struck
into
the
hot
plain
and
found
the
roads
crowded
with
pilgrims
of
both
sexes
for
one
of
the
great
religious
fairs
of
india
was
being
held
just
beyond
the
fort
at
the
junction
of
the
sacred
rivers
the
ganges
and
the
jumna
three
sacred
rivers
i
should
have
said
for
there
is
a
subterranean
one
nobody
has
seen
it
but
that
signify
the
fact
that
it
is
there
is
enough
these
pilgrims
had
come
from
all
over
india
some
of
them
had
been
months
on
the
way
plodding
patiently
along
in
the
heat
and
dust
worn
poor
hungry
but
supported
and
sustained
by
an
unwavering
faith
and
belief
they
were
supremely
happy
and
content
now
their
full
and
sufficient
reward
was
at
hand
they
were
going
to
be
cleansed
from
every
vestige
of
sin
and
corruption
by
these
holy
waters
which
make
utterly
pure
whatsoever
thing
they
touch
even
the
dead
and
rotten
it
is
wonderful
the
power
of
a
faith
like
that
that
can
make
multitudes
upon
multitudes
of
the
old
and
weak
and
the
young
and
frail
enter
without
hesitation
or
complaint
upon
such
incredible
journeys
and
endure
the
resultant
miseries
without
repining
it
is
done
in
love
or
it
is
done
in
fear
i
do
not
know
which
it
is
no
matter
what
the
impulse
is
the
act
born
of
it
is
beyond
imagination
marvelous
to
our
kind
of
people
the
cold
whites
there
are
choice
great
natures
among
us
that
could
exhibit
the
equivalent
of
this
prodigious
but
the
rest
of
us
know
that
we
should
not
be
equal
to
anything
approaching
it
still
we
all
talk
and
this
makes
me
hope
that
we
are
large
enough
to
honor
it
in
the
hindoo
two
millions
of
natives
arrive
at
this
fair
every
year
how
many
start
and
die
on
the
road
from
age
and
fatigue
and
disease
and
scanty
nourishment
and
how
many
die
on
the
return
from
the
same
causes
no
one
knows
but
the
tale
is
great
one
may
say
enormous
every
twelfth
year
is
held
to
be
a
year
of
peculiar
grace
a
greatly
augmented
volume
of
pilgrims
results
then
the
twelfth
year
has
held
this
distinction
since
the
remotest
times
it
is
said
it
is
said
also
that
there
is
to
be
but
one
more
twelfth
year
for
the
ganges
after
that
that
holiest
of
all
sacred
rivers
will
cease
to
be
holy
and
will
be
abandoned
by
the
pilgrim
for
many
centuries
how
many
the
wise
men
have
not
stated
at
the
end
of
that
interval
it
will
become
holy
again
meantime
the
data
will
be
arranged
by
those
people
who
have
charge
of
all
such
matters
the
great
chief
brahmins
it
will
be
like
shutting
down
a
mint
at
a
first
glance
it
looks
most
unbrahminically
uncommercial
but
i
am
not
disturbed
being
soothed
and
tranquilized
by
their
reputation
brer
fox
he
lay
low
as
uncle
remus
says
and
at
the
judicious
time
he
will
spring
something
on
the
indian
public
which
will
show
that
he
was
not
financially
asleep
when
he
took
the
ganges
out
of
the
market
great
numbers
of
the
natives
along
the
roads
were
bringing
away
holy
water
from
the
rivers
they
would
carry
it
far
and
wide
in
india
and
sell
it
tavernier
the
french
traveler
century
notes
that
ganges
water
is
often
given
at
weddings
each
guest
receiving
a
cup
or
two
according
to
the
liberality
of
the
host
sometimes
or
rupees
worth
of
it
is
consumed
at
a
wedding
the
fort
is
a
huge
old
structure
and
has
had
a
large
experience
in
religions
in
its
great
court
stands
a
monolith
which
was
placed
there
more
than
years
ago
to
preach
budhism
by
its
pious
inscription
the
fort
was
built
three
centuries
ago
by
a
mohammedan
emperor
a
resanctification
of
the
place
in
the
interest
of
that
religion
there
is
a
hindoo
temple
too
with
subterranean
ramifications
stocked
with
shrines
and
idols
and
now
the
fort
belongs
to
the
english
it
contains
a
christian
church
insured
in
all
the
companies
from
the
lofty
ramparts
one
has
a
fine
view
of
the
sacred
rivers
they
join
at
that
point
the
pale
blue
jumna
apparently
clean
and
clear
and
the
muddy
ganges
dull
yellow
and
not
clean
on
a
long
curved
spit
between
the
rivers
towns
of
tents
were
visible
with
a
multitude
of
fluttering
pennons
and
a
mighty
swarm
of
pilgrims
it
was
a
troublesome
place
to
get
down
to
and
not
a
quiet
place
when
you
arrived
but
it
was
interesting
there
was
a
world
of
activity
and
turmoil
and
noise
partly
religious
partly
commercial
for
the
mohammedans
were
there
to
curse
and
sell
and
the
hindoos
to
buy
and
pray
it
is
a
fair
as
well
as
a
religious
festival
crowds
were
bathing
praying
and
drinking
the
purifying
waters
and
many
sick
pilgrims
had
come
long
journeys
in
palanquins
to
be
healed
of
their
maladies
by
a
bath
or
if
that
might
not
be
then
to
die
on
the
blessed
banks
and
so
make
sure
of
heaven
there
were
fakeers
in
plenty
with
their
bodies
dusted
over
with
ashes
and
their
long
hair
caked
together
with
for
the
cow
is
holy
and
so
is
the
rest
of
it
so
holy
that
the
good
hindoo
peasant
frescoes
the
walls
of
his
hut
with
this
refuse
and
also
constructs
ornamental
figures
out
of
it
for
the
gracing
of
his
dirt
floor
there
were
seated
families
fearfully
and
wonderfully
painted
who
by
attitude
and
grouping
represented
the
families
of
certain
great
gods
there
was
a
holy
man
who
sat
naked
by
the
day
and
by
the
week
on
a
cluster
of
iron
spikes
and
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
and
another
holy
man
who
stood
all
day
holding
his
withered
arms
motionless
aloft
and
was
said
to
have
been
doing
it
for
years
all
of
these
performers
have
a
cloth
on
the
ground
beside
them
for
the
reception
of
contributions
and
even
the
poorest
of
the
people
give
a
trifle
and
hope
that
the
sacrifice
will
be
blessed
to
him
at
last
came
a
procession
of
naked
holy
people
marching
by
and
chanting
and
i
wrenched
myself
away
chapter
the
man
who
is
ostentatious
of
his
modesty
is
twin
to
the
statue
that
wears
a
wilson
new
calendar
the
journey
to
benares
was
all
in
daylight
and
occupied
but
a
few
hours
it
was
admirably
dusty
the
dust
settled
upon
you
in
a
thick
ashy
layer
and
turned
you
into
a
fakeer
with
nothing
lacking
to
the
role
but
the
cow
manure
and
the
sense
of
holiness
there
was
a
change
of
cars
about
at
if
that
was
the
name
and
a
wait
of
two
hours
there
for
the
benares
train
we
could
have
found
a
carriage
and
driven
to
the
sacred
city
but
we
should
have
lost
the
wait
in
other
countries
a
long
wait
at
a
station
is
a
dull
thing
and
tedious
but
one
has
no
right
to
have
that
feeling
in
india
you
have
the
monster
crowd
of
bejeweled
natives
the
stir
the
bustle
the
confusion
the
shifting
splendors
of
the
costumes
dear
me
the
delight
of
it
the
charm
of
it
are
beyond
speech
the
wait
was
over
too
soon
among
other
satisfying
things
to
look
at
was
a
minor
native
prince
from
the
backwoods
somewhere
with
his
guard
of
honor
a
ragged
but
wonderfully
gaudy
gang
of
fifty
dark
barbarians
armed
with
rusty
muskets
the
general
show
came
so
near
to
exhausting
variety
that
one
would
have
said
that
no
addition
to
it
could
be
conspicuous
but
when
this
falstaff
and
his
motleys
marched
through
it
one
saw
that
that
seeming
impossibility
had
happened
we
got
away
by
and
by
and
soon
reached
the
outer
edge
of
benares
then
there
was
another
wait
but
as
usual
with
something
to
look
at
this
was
a
cluster
of
little
palanquins
a
is
not
much
of
a
sight
when
empty
but
when
there
is
a
lady
in
it
it
is
an
object
of
interest
these
boxes
were
grouped
apart
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
terrible
sun
during
the
of
an
hour
that
we
tarried
there
they
contained
zenana
ladies
they
had
to
sit
up
there
was
not
room
enough
to
stretch
out
they
probably
did
not
mind
it
they
are
used
to
the
close
captivity
of
the
dwellings
all
their
lives
when
they
go
a
journey
they
are
carried
to
the
train
in
these
boxes
in
the
train
they
have
to
be
secluded
from
inspection
many
people
pity
them
and
i
always
did
it
myself
and
never
charged
anything
but
it
is
doubtful
if
this
compassion
is
valued
while
we
were
in
india
some
europeans
in
one
of
the
cities
proposed
to
restrict
a
large
park
to
the
use
of
zenana
ladies
so
that
they
could
go
there
and
in
assured
privacy
go
about
unveiled
and
enjoy
the
sunshine
and
air
as
they
had
never
enjoyed
them
before
the
good
intentions
back
of
the
proposition
were
recognized
and
sincere
thanks
returned
for
it
but
the
proposition
itself
met
with
a
prompt
declination
at
the
hands
of
those
who
were
authorized
to
speak
for
the
zenana
ladies
apparently
the
idea
was
shocking
to
the
ladies
indeed
it
was
quite
manifestly
shocking
was
that
proposition
the
equivalent
of
inviting
european
ladies
to
assemble
scantily
and
scandalously
clothed
in
the
seclusion
of
a
private
park
it
seemed
to
be
about
that
without
doubt
modesty
is
nothing
less
than
a
holy
feeling
and
without
doubt
the
person
whose
rule
of
modesty
has
been
transgressed
feels
the
same
sort
of
wound
that
he
would
feel
if
something
made
holy
to
him
by
his
religion
had
suffered
a
desecration
i
say
rule
of
modesty
because
there
are
about
a
million
rules
in
the
world
and
this
makes
a
million
standards
to
be
looked
out
for
major
sleeman
mentions
the
case
of
some
veiled
ladies
who
were
profoundly
scandalized
when
some
english
young
ladies
passed
by
with
faces
bare
to
the
world
so
scandalized
that
they
spoke
out
with
strong
indignation
and
wondered
that
people
could
be
so
shameless
as
to
expose
their
persons
like
that
and
yet
the
legs
of
the
objectors
were
naked
to
both
parties
were
and
irreproachably
modest
while
abiding
by
their
separate
rules
but
they
could
have
traded
rules
for
a
change
without
suffering
considerable
discomfort
all
human
rules
are
more
or
less
idiotic
i
suppose
it
is
best
so
no
doubt
the
way
it
is
now
the
asylums
can
hold
the
sane
people
but
if
we
tried
to
shut
up
the
insane
we
should
run
out
of
building
materials
you
have
a
long
drive
through
the
outskirts
of
benares
before
you
get
to
the
hotel
and
all
the
aspects
are
melancholy
it
is
a
vision
of
dusty
sterility
decaying
temples
crumbling
tombs
broken
mud
walls
shabby
huts
the
whole
region
seems
to
ache
with
age
and
penury
it
must
take
ten
thousand
years
of
want
to
produce
such
an
aspect
we
were
still
outside
of
the
great
native
city
when
we
reached
the
hotel
it
was
a
quiet
and
homelike
house
inviting
and
manifestly
comfortable
but
we
liked
its
annex
better
and
went
thither
it
was
a
mile
away
perhaps
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
large
compound
and
was
built
bungalow
fashion
everything
on
the
ground
floor
and
a
veranda
all
around
they
have
doors
in
india
but
i
do
know
why
they
do
fasten
and
they
stand
open
as
a
rule
with
a
curtain
hanging
in
the
doorspace
to
keep
out
the
glare
of
the
sun
still
there
is
plenty
of
privacy
for
no
white
person
will
come
in
without
notice
of
course
the
native
men
servants
will
but
they
do
seem
to
count
they
glide
in
barefoot
and
noiseless
and
are
in
the
midst
before
one
knows
it
at
first
this
is
a
shock
and
sometimes
it
is
an
embarrassment
but
one
has
to
get
used
to
it
and
does
there
was
one
tree
in
the
compound
and
a
monkey
lived
in
it
at
first
i
was
strongly
interested
in
the
tree
for
i
was
told
that
it
was
the
renowned
peepul
the
tree
in
whose
shadow
you
can
not
tell
a
lie
this
one
failed
to
stand
the
test
and
i
went
away
from
it
disappointed
there
was
a
softly
creaking
well
close
by
and
a
couple
of
oxen
drew
water
from
it
by
the
hour
superintended
by
two
natives
dressed
in
the
usual
turban
and
the
tree
and
the
well
were
the
only
scenery
and
so
the
compound
was
a
soothing
and
lonesome
and
satisfying
place
and
very
restful
after
so
many
activities
there
was
nobody
in
our
bungalow
but
ourselves
the
other
guests
were
in
the
next
one
where
the
table
was
furnished
a
body
could
not
be
more
pleasantly
situated
each
room
had
the
customary
bath
attached
a
room
ten
or
twelve
feet
square
with
a
roomy
pit
in
it
and
abundance
of
water
one
could
not
easily
improve
upon
this
arrangement
except
by
furnishing
it
with
cold
water
and
excluding
the
hot
in
deference
to
the
fervency
of
the
climate
but
that
is
forbidden
it
would
damage
the
bather
health
the
stranger
is
warned
against
taking
cold
baths
in
india
but
even
the
most
intelligent
strangers
are
fools
and
they
do
not
obey
and
so
they
presently
get
laid
up
i
was
the
most
intelligent
fool
that
passed
through
that
year
but
i
am
still
more
intelligent
now
now
that
it
is
too
late
i
wonder
if
the
if
that
is
the
name
of
it
is
another
superstition
like
the
peepul
tree
there
was
a
great
abundance
and
variety
of
tropical
fruits
but
the
dorian
was
never
in
evidence
it
was
never
the
season
for
the
dorian
it
was
always
going
to
arrive
from
burma
sometime
or
other
but
it
never
did
by
all
accounts
it
was
a
most
strange
fruit
and
incomparably
delicious
to
the
taste
but
not
to
the
smell
its
rind
was
said
to
exude
a
stench
of
so
atrocious
a
nature
that
when
a
dorian
was
in
the
room
even
the
presence
of
a
polecat
was
a
refreshment
we
found
many
who
had
eaten
the
dorian
and
they
all
spoke
of
it
with
a
sort
of
rapture
they
said
that
if
you
could
hold
your
nose
until
the
fruit
was
in
your
mouth
a
sacred
joy
would
suffuse
you
from
head
to
foot
that
would
make
you
oblivious
to
the
smell
of
the
rind
but
that
if
your
grip
slipped
and
you
caught
the
smell
of
the
rind
before
the
fruit
was
in
your
mouth
you
would
faint
there
is
a
fortune
in
that
rind
some
day
somebody
will
import
it
into
europe
and
sell
it
for
cheese
benares
was
not
a
disappointment
it
justified
its
reputation
as
a
curiosity
it
is
on
high
ground
and
overhangs
a
grand
curve
of
the
ganges
it
is
a
vast
mass
of
building
compactly
crusting
a
hill
and
is
cloven
in
all
directions
by
an
intricate
confusion
of
cracks
which
stand
for
streets
tall
slim
minarets
and
beflagged
rise
out
of
it
and
give
it
picturesqueness
viewed
from
the
river
the
city
is
as
busy
as
an
and
the
of
human
life
swarming
along
the
web
of
narrow
streets
reminds
one
of
the
ants
the
sacred
cow
swarms
along
too
and
goes
whither
she
pleases
and
takes
toll
of
the
and
is
very
much
in
the
way
and
is
a
good
deal
of
a
nuisance
since
she
must
not
be
molested
benares
is
older
than
history
older
than
tradition
older
even
than
legend
and
looks
twice
as
old
as
all
of
them
put
together
from
a
hindoo
statement
quoted
in
rev
parker
compact
and
lucid
guide
to
benares
i
find
that
the
site
of
the
town
was
the
of
the
creation
it
was
merely
an
upright
lingam
at
first
no
larger
than
a
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
shoreless
ocean
this
was
the
work
of
the
god
vishnu
later
he
spread
the
lingam
out
till
its
surface
was
ten
miles
across
still
it
was
not
large
enough
for
the
business
therefore
he
presently
built
the
globe
around
it
benares
is
thus
the
center
of
the
earth
this
is
considered
an
advantage
it
has
had
a
tumultuous
history
both
materially
and
spiritually
it
started
brahminically
many
ages
ago
then
by
and
by
buddha
came
in
recent
times
years
ago
and
after
that
it
was
buddhist
during
many
centuries
twelve
perhaps
but
the
brahmins
got
the
upper
hand
again
then
and
have
held
it
ever
since
it
is
unspeakably
sacred
in
hindoo
eyes
and
is
as
unsanitary
as
it
is
sacred
and
smells
like
the
rind
of
the
dorian
it
is
the
headquarters
of
the
brahmin
faith
and
of
the
population
are
priests
of
that
church
but
it
is
not
an
overstock
for
they
have
all
india
as
a
prey
all
india
flocks
thither
on
pilgrimage
and
pours
its
savings
into
the
pockets
of
the
priests
in
a
generous
stream
which
never
fails
a
priest
with
a
good
stand
on
the
shore
of
the
ganges
is
much
better
off
than
the
sweeper
of
the
best
crossing
in
london
a
good
stand
is
worth
a
world
of
money
the
holy
proprietor
of
it
sits
under
his
grand
spectacular
umbrella
and
blesses
people
all
his
life
and
collects
his
commission
and
grows
fat
and
rich
and
the
stand
passes
from
father
to
son
down
and
down
and
down
through
the
ages
and
remains
a
permanent
and
lucrative
estate
in
the
family
as
parker
suggests
it
can
become
a
subject
of
dispute
at
one
time
or
another
and
then
the
matter
will
be
settled
not
by
prayer
and
fasting
and
consultations
with
vishnu
but
by
the
intervention
of
a
much
more
puissant
power
an
english
court
in
bombay
i
was
told
by
an
american
missionary
that
in
india
there
are
protestant
missionaries
at
work
at
first
it
seemed
an
immense
force
but
of
course
that
was
a
thoughtless
idea
one
missionary
to
natives
no
that
is
not
a
force
it
is
the
reverse
of
it
marching
against
an
intrenched
camp
of
the
odds
are
too
great
a
force
of
in
benares
alone
would
have
its
hands
with
brahmin
priests
for
adversary
missionaries
need
to
be
well
equipped
with
hope
and
confidence
and
this
equipment
they
seem
to
have
always
had
in
all
parts
of
the
world
parker
has
it
it
enables
him
to
get
a
favorable
outlook
out
of
statistics
which
might
add
up
differently
with
other
mathematicians
for
instance
during
the
past
few
years
competent
observers
declare
that
the
number
of
pilgrims
to
benares
has
increased
and
then
he
adds
up
this
fact
and
gets
this
conclusion
but
the
revival
if
so
it
may
be
called
has
in
it
the
marks
of
death
it
is
a
spasmodic
struggle
before
dissolution
in
this
world
we
have
seen
the
roman
catholic
power
dying
upon
these
same
terms
for
many
centuries
many
a
time
we
have
gotten
all
ready
for
the
funeral
and
found
it
postponed
again
on
account
of
the
weather
or
something
taught
by
experience
we
ought
not
to
put
on
our
things
for
this
brahminical
one
till
we
see
the
procession
move
apparently
one
of
the
most
uncertain
things
in
the
world
is
the
funeral
of
a
religion
i
should
have
been
glad
to
acquire
some
sort
of
idea
of
hindoo
theology
but
the
difficulties
were
too
great
the
matter
was
too
intricate
even
the
mere
a
b
c
of
it
is
baffling
there
is
a
trinity
brahma
shiva
and
vishnu
independent
powers
apparently
though
one
can
not
feel
quite
sure
of
that
because
in
one
of
the
temples
there
is
an
image
where
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
concentrate
the
three
in
one
person
the
three
have
other
names
and
plenty
of
them
and
this
makes
confusion
in
one
mind
the
three
have
wives
and
the
wives
have
several
names
and
this
increases
the
confusion
there
are
children
the
children
have
many
names
and
thus
the
confusion
goes
on
and
on
it
is
not
worth
while
to
try
to
get
any
grip
upon
the
cloud
of
minor
gods
there
are
too
many
of
them
it
is
even
a
justifiable
economy
to
leave
brahma
the
chiefest
god
of
all
out
of
your
studies
for
he
seems
to
cut
no
great
figure
in
india
the
vast
bulk
of
the
national
worship
is
lavished
upon
shiva
and
vishnu
and
their
families
shiva
symbol
the
lingam
with
which
vishnu
began
the
creation
is
worshiped
by
everybody
apparently
it
is
the
commonest
object
in
benares
it
is
on
view
everywhere
it
is
garlanded
with
flowers
offerings
are
made
to
it
it
suffers
no
neglect
commonly
it
is
an
upright
stone
shaped
like
a
like
an
elongated
thimble
this
then
is
older
than
history
parker
says
that
the
lingams
in
benares
outnumber
the
inhabitants
in
benares
there
are
many
mohammedan
mosques
there
are
hindoo
temples
without
number
these
quaintly
shaped
and
elaborately
sculptured
little
stone
jugs
crowd
all
the
lanes
the
ganges
itself
and
every
individual
drop
of
water
in
it
are
temples
religion
then
is
the
business
of
benares
just
as
is
the
business
of
johannesburg
other
industries
count
for
nothing
as
compared
with
the
vast
and
rush
and
drive
and
boom
of
the
town
specialty
benares
is
the
sacredest
of
sacred
cities
the
moment
you
step
across
the
line
which
separates
it
from
the
rest
of
the
globe
you
stand
upon
ineffably
and
unspeakably
holy
ground
parker
says
it
is
impossible
to
convey
any
adequate
idea
of
the
intense
feelings
of
veneration
and
affection
with
which
the
pious
hindoo
regards
benares
and
then
he
gives
you
this
vivid
and
moving
picture
let
a
hindoo
regiment
be
marched
through
the
district
and
as
soon
as
they
cross
the
line
and
enter
the
limits
of
the
holy
place
they
rend
the
air
with
cries
of
ji
ki
jai
jai
jai
holy
kashi
hail
to
thee
hail
hail
hail
the
weary
pilgrim
scarcely
able
to
stand
with
age
and
weakness
blinded
by
the
dust
and
heat
and
almost
dead
with
fatigue
crawls
out
of
the
railway
carriage
and
as
soon
as
his
feet
touch
the
ground
he
lifts
up
his
withered
hands
and
utters
the
same
pious
exclamation
let
a
european
in
some
distant
city
in
casual
talk
in
the
bazar
mention
the
fact
that
he
has
lived
at
benares
and
at
once
voices
will
be
raised
to
call
down
blessings
on
his
head
for
a
dweller
in
benares
is
of
all
men
most
blessed
it
makes
our
own
religious
enthusiasm
seem
pale
and
cold
inasmuch
as
the
life
of
religion
is
in
the
heart
not
the
head
parker
touching
picture
seems
to
promise
a
sort
of
indefinite
postponement
of
that
funeral
