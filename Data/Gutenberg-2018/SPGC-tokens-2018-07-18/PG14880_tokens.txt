the
moral
tone

plain
she
is
kind
to
the
old
blind
man

exercises
are
still
suitable
and
perhaps
more
helpful
than
some
contemporary
alternatives
much
is
left
to
the
teacher
explanations
given
in
the
text
are
enough
to
get
started
teaching
a
child
to
read
and
write
counting
in
roman
numerals
is
included
as
a
bonus
in
the
form
of
lesson
numbers
the
form
of
contractions
includes
a
space
the
contemporary
word
do
was
rendered
as

new
in
revising
the
fourth
reader
the
aim
has
been
as
it
has
with
the
other
books
of
the
series
to
preserve
unimpaired
all
the
essential
characteristics
of
mcguffey
readers
new
articles
have
been
substituted
for
old
ones
only
where
the
advantage
was
manifest
the
book
has
been
considerably
enlarged
and
has
been
liberally
illustrated
by
the
first
artists
of
the
country
it
can
not
be
presumed
that
every
pupil
has
at
hand
all
the
works
of
reference
necessary
for
the
proper
preparation
of
each
lesson
hence
all
the
aids
that
seem
requisite
to
this
purpose
have
been
given
brief
notices
concerning
the
various
authors
represented
have
been
inserted
the
more
difficult
words
have
been
defined
and
their
pronunciation
has
been
indicated
by
diacritical

the
elementary
sounds
of
the
english
language
are
divided
into
vocals
subvocals
and
aspirates

pure
tone

elements
of
speech

union
of
two
vocals
commencing

one
and
ending
with

perseverance
will
you
give
my
kite
a
lift
said
my
little
nephew
to
his
sister
after
trying
in
vain
to
make
it
fly
by
dragging
it
along
the
ground
lucy
very
kindly
took
it
up
and
threw
it
into
the
air
but
her
brother
neglecting
to
run
off
at
the
same
moment
the
kite
fell
down
again
ah
now
how
awkward
you
are
said
the
little
fellow
it
was
your
fault
entirely
answered
his
sister
try
again
children
said
i
lucy
once
more
took
up
the
kite
but
now
john
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
he
ran
off
so
suddenly
that
he
twitched
the
kite
out
of
her
hand
and
it
fell
flat
as
before
well
who
is
to
blame
now
asked
lucy
try
again
said
i
they
did
and
with
more
care
but
a
side
wind
coming
suddenly
as
lucy
let
go
the
kite
it
was
blown
against
some
shrubs
and
the
tail
became
entangled
in
a
moment
leaving
the
poor
kite
hanging
with
its
head
downward
there
there
exclaimed
john
that
comes
of
your
throwing
it
all
to
one
side
as
if
i
could
make
the
wind
blow
straight
said
lucy
in
the
meantime
i
went
to
the
kite
assistance
and
having
disengaged
the
long
tail
i
rolled
it
up
saying
come
children
there
are
too
many
trees
here
let
us
find
a
more
open
space
and
then
try
again
we
presently
found
a
nice
grassplot
at
one
side
of
which
i
took
my
stand
and
all
things
being
prepared
i
tossed
the
kite
up
just
as
little
john
ran
off
it
rose
with
all
the
dignity
of
a
balloon
and
promised
a
lofty
flight
but
john
delighted
to
find
it
pulling
so
hard
at
the
string
stopped
short
to
look
upward
and
admire
the
string
slackened
the
kite
wavered
and
the
wind
not
being
very
favorable
down
came
the
kite
to
the
grass
o
john
you
should
not
have
stopped
said
i
however
try
again
i
wo
try
any
more
replied
he
rather
sullenly
it
is
of
no
use
you
see
the
kite
wo
fly
and
i
do
want
to
be
plagued
with
it
any
longer
oh
fie
my
little
man
would
you
give
up
the
sport
after
all
the
pains
we
have
taken
both
to
make
and
to
fly
the
kite
a
few
disappointments
ought
not
to
discourage
us
come
i
have
wound
up
your
string
and
now
try
again
and
he
did
try
and
succeeded
for
the
kite
was
carried
upward
on
the
breeze
as
lightly
as
a
feather
and
when
the
string
was
all
out
john
stood
in
great
delight
holding
fast
the
stick
and
gazing
on
the
kite
which
now
seemed
like
a
little
white
speck
in
the
blue
sky
look
look
aunt
how
high
it
flies
and
it
pulls
like
a
team
of
horses
so
that
i
can
hardly
hold
it
i
wish
i
had
a
mile
of
string
i
am
sure
it
would
go
to
the
end
of
it
after
enjoying
the
sight
as
long
as
he
pleased
little
john
proceeded
to
roll
up
the
string
slowly
and
when
the
kite
fell
he
took
it
up
with
great
glee
saying
that
it
was
not
at
all
hurt
and
that
it
had
behaved
very
well
shall
we
come
out
aunt
after
lessons
and
try
again
i
have
no
objection
my
dear
if
the
weather
is
fine
and
now
as
we
walk
home
tell
me
what
you
have
learned
from
your
morning
sport
i
have
learned
to
fly
my
kite
properly
you
may
thank
aunt
for
it
brother
said
lucy
for
you
would
have
given
it
up
long
ago
if
she
had
not
persuaded
you
to
try
again
yes
dear
children
i
wish
to
teach
you
the
value
of
perseverance
even
when
nothing
more
depends
upon
it
than
the
flying
of
a
kite
whenever
you
fail
in
your
attempts
to
do
any
good
thing
let
your
motto
be
try

him

a
fairy
tale
mary
howitt
was
born
in
at
coleford
england
she
wrote
many
charming
stories
for
children
in
prose
and
verse
and
also
translated
many
from
swedish
danish
and
german
authors
this
story
is
arranged
from
one
in
a
collection
named
peter
drake
dream
and
other
stories
she
died
in
there
were
in
very
ancient
times
two
brothers
one
of
whom
was
rich
and
the
other
poor
christmas
was
approaching
but
the
poor
man
had
nothing
in
the
house
for
a
christmas
dinner
so
he
went
to
his
brother
and
asked
him
for
a
trifling
gift
the
rich
man
was
and
when
he
heard
his
brother
request
he
looked
very
surly
but
as
christmas
is
a
time
when
even
the
worst
people
give
gifts
he
took
a
fine
ham
down
from
the
chimney
where
it
was
hanging
to
smoke
threw
it
at
his
brother
and
bade
him
begone
and
never
to
let
him
see
his
face
again
the
poor
man
thanked
his
brother
for
the
ham
put
it
under
his
arm
and
went
his
way
he
had
to
pass
through
a
great
forest
on
his
way
home
when
he
had
reached
the
thickest
part
of
it
he
saw
an
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
hewing
timber
good
evening
said
he
to
him
good
evening
returned
the
old
man
raising
himself
up
from
his
work
and
looking
at
him
that
is
a
fine
ham
you
are
carrying
on
this
the
poor
man
told
him
all
about
it
it
is
lucky
for
you
said
the
old
man
that
you
have
met
with
me
if
you
will
take
that
ham
into
the
land
of
the
dwarfs
the
entrance
to
which
lies
just
under
the
roots
of
this
tree
you
can
make
a
capital
bargain
with
it
for
the
dwarfs
are
very
fond
of
ham
and
rarely
get
any
but
mind
what
i
say
you
must
not
sell
it
for
money
but
demand
for
it
the
hand
mill
which
stands
behind
the
door
when
you
come
back
i
show
you
how
to
use
it
the
poor
man
thanked
his
new
friend
who
showed
him
the
door
under
a
stone
below
the
roots
of
the
tree
and
by
this
door
he
entered
into
the
land
of
the
dwarfs
no
sooner
had
he
set
his
foot
in
it
than
the
dwarfs
swarmed
about
him
attracted
by
the
smell
of
the
ham
they
offered
him
queer
money
and
gold
and
silver
ore
for
it
but
he
refused
all
their
tempting
offers
and
said
that
he
would
sell
it
only
for
the
old
hand
mill
behind
the
door
at
this
the
dwarfs
held
up
their
little
old
hands
and
looked
quite
perplexed
we
can
not
make
a
bargain
it
seems
said
the
poor
man
so
i
bid
you
all
a
good
day
the
fragrance
of
the
ham
had
by
this
time
reached
the
remote
parts
of
dwarf
land
the
dwarfs
came
flocking
around
in
little
troops
leaving
their
work
of
digging
out
precious
ores
eager
for
the
ham
let
him
have
the
old
mill
said
some
of
the
newcomers
it
is
quite
out
of
order
and
he
do
know
how
to
use
it
let
him
have
it
and
we
will
have
the
ham
so
the
bargain
was
made
the
poor
man
took
the
old
hand
mill
which
was
a
little
thing
not
half
so
large
as
the
ham
and
went
back
to
the
woods
here
the
old
man
showed
him
how
to
use
it
all
this
had
taken
up
a
great
deal
of
time
and
it
was
midnight
before
he
reached
home
where
in
the
world
have
you
been
said
his
wife
here
i
have
been
waiting
and
waiting
and
we
have
no
wood
to
make
a
fire
nor
anything
to
put
into
the
porridge
pot
for
our
christmas
supper
the
house
was
dark
and
cold
but
the
poor
man
bade
his
wife
wait
and
see
what
would
happen
he
placed
the
little
hand
mill
on
the
table
and
began
to
turn
the
crank
first
out
there
came
some
grand
lighted
wax
candles
and
a
fire
on
the
hearth
and
a
porridge
pot
boiling
over
it
because
in
his
mind
he
said
they
should
come
first
then
he
ground
out
a
tablecloth
and
dishes
and
spoons
and
knives
and
forks
he
was
himself
astonished
at
his
good
luck
as
you
may
believe
and
his
wife
was
almost
beside
herself
with
joy
and
astonishment
well
they
had
a
capital
supper
and
after
it
was
eaten
they
ground
out
of
the
mill
every
possible
thing
to
make
their
house
and
themselves
warm
and
comfortable
so
they
had
a
merry
christmas
eve
and
morning
l
of
small
value
hand
a
mill
turned
by
hand
drawn
to
allured
perplexed
puzzled
sweetness
of
smell
iv
why
the
sea
is
salt
concluded
when
the
people
went
by
the
house
to
church
the
next
day
they
could
hardly
believe
their
eyes
there
was
glass
in
the
windows
instead
of
a
wooden
shutter
and
the
poor
man
and
his
wife
dressed
in
nice
new
clothes
were
seen
devoutly
kneeling
in
the
church
there
is
something
very
strange
in
all
this
said
everyone
something
very
strange
indeed
said
the
rich
man
when
three
days
afterwards
he
received
an
invitation
from
his
once
poor
brother
to
a
grand
feast
and
what
a
feast
it
was
the
table
was
covered
with
a
cloth
as
white
as
snow
and
the
dishes
were
all
of
silver
or
gold
the
rich
man
could
not
in
his
great
house
and
with
all
his
wealth
set
out
such
a
table
where
did
you
get
all
these
things
exclaimed
he
his
brother
told
him
all
about
the
bargain
he
had
made
with
the
dwarfs
and
putting
the
mill
on
the
table
ground
out
boots
and
shoes
coats
and
cloaks
stockings
gowns
and
blankets
and
bade
his
wife
give
them
to
the
poor
people
that
had
gathered
about
the
house
to
get
a
sight
of
the
grand
feast
the
poor
brother
had
made
for
the
rich
one
the
rich
man
was
very
envious
of
his
brother
good
fortune
and
wanted
to
borrow
the
mill
intending
for
he
was
not
an
honest
man
never
to
return
it
again
his
brother
would
not
lend
it
for
the
old
man
with
the
white
beard
had
told
him
never
to
sell
or
lend
it
to
anyone
some
years
went
on
and
at
last
the
possessor
of
the
mill
built
himself
a
grand
castle
on
a
rock
by
the
sea
facing
the
west
its
windows
reflecting
the
golden
sunset
could
be
seen
far
out
from
the
shore
it
became
a
noted
landmark
for
sailors
strangers
from
foreign
parts
often
came
to
see
this
castle
and
the
wonderful
mill
of
which
the
most
extraordinary
tales
were
told
at
length
a
great
foreign
merchant
came
and
when
he
had
seen
the
mill
inquired
whether
it
would
grind
salt
being
told
that
it
would
he
wanted
to
buy
it
for
he
traded
in
salt
and
thought
that
if
he
owned
it
he
could
supply
all
his
customers
without
taking
long
and
dangerous
voyages
the
man
would
not
sell
it
of
course
he
was
so
rich
now
that
he
did
not
want
to
use
it
for
himself
but
every
christmas
he
ground
out
food
and
clothes
and
coal
for
the
poor
and
nice
presents
for
the
little
children
so
he
rejected
all
the
offers
of
the
rich
merchant
the
merchant
however
determined
to
have
it
he
bribed
one
of
the
man
servants
to
let
him
go
into
the
castle
at
night
and
he
stole
the
mill
and
sailed
away
with
it
in
triumph
he
had
scarcely
got
out
to
sea
before
he
determined
to
set
the
mill
to
work
now
mill
grind
salt
said
he
grind
salt
with
all
your
might
salt
salt
and
nothing
but
salt
the
mill
began
to
grind
and
the
sailors
to
fill
the
sacks
but
these
were
soon
full
and
in
spite
of
all
that
could
be
done
it
began
to
fill
the
ship
the
dishonest
merchant
was
now
very
much
frightened
what
was
to
be
done
the
mill
would
not
stop
grinding
and
at
last
the
ship
was
overloaded
and
down
it
went
making
a
great
whirlpool
where
it
sank
the
ship
soon
went
to
pieces
but
the
mill
stands
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
keeps
grinding
out
salt
salt
nothing
but
salt
that
is
the
reason
say
the
peasants
of
denmark
and
norway
why
the
sea
is
salt

what
is
a
fairy
tale
what
fairy
people
are
told
about
in
this
story
how
did
the
poor
man
find
the
way
to
the
land
of
the
dwarfs
do
you
think
the
old
man
would
have
told
him
if
the
poor
man
had
not
been
so
polite
how
did
the
poor
man
treat
his
rich
brother
in
return
for
his
unkindness

was

of

dishonest
merchant
punished

popping
corn
one
autumn
night
when
the
wind
was
high
and
the
rain
fell
in
heavy
plashes
a
little
boy
sat
by
the
kitchen
fire
corn
in
the
ashes
and
his
sister
a
child
of
three
sat
looking
on
just
close
to
his
knee
pop
pop
and
the
kernels
one
by
one
came
out
of
the
embers
flying
the
boy
held
a
long
pine
stick
in
his
hand
and
kept
it
busily
plying
he
stirred
the
corn
and
it
snapped
the
more
and
faster
jumped
to
the
floor
part
of
the
kernels
flew
one
way
and
a
part
hopped
out
the
other
some
flew
plump
into
the
sister
lap
some
under
the
stool
of
the
brother
the
little
girl
gathered
them
into
a
heap
and
called
them
a
flock
of
sheep
vi
smiles
poor
lame
jennie
sat
at
her
window
looking
out
upon
the
dismal
narrow
street
with
a
look
of
pain
and
weariness
on
her
face
oh
dear
she
said
with
a
sigh
what
a
long
day
this
is
going
to
be
and
she
looked
wishfully
up
the
street
suddenly
she
leaned
forward
and
pressed
her
pale
face
against
the
glass
as
a
boy
came
racing
down
the
street
swinging
his
schoolbooks
by
the
strap
looking
up
to
the
window
he
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
with
a
bright
pleasant
smile
what
a
nice
boy
he
is
said
jennie
to
herself
as
he
ran
out
of
sight
i
am
so
glad
he
goes
by
here
on
his
way
to
school
when
he
smiles
it
seems
like
having
the
sun
shine
i
wish
everybody
who
goes
by
would
look
up
and
smile
mamma
said
george
west
as
he
came
from
school
i
ca
help
thinking
about
that
poor
little
girl
i
told
you
of
the
other
day
she
looks
so
tired
i
took
off
my
hat
and
bowed
to
her
i
wish
i
could
do
something
for
her
suppose
you
should
carry
her
a
handful
of
pretty
flowers
some
time
when
you
go
to
school
said
west
i
do
that
morning
said
george
if
i
can
find
my
way
into
that
rickety
old
house
the
next
morning
as
jennie
sat
leaning
her
head
wearily
against
the
window
watching
the
raindrops
chasing
one
another
down
the
glass
she
spied
george
with
a
handful
of
beautiful
flowers
carefully
picking
his
way
across
the
street
he
stopped
in
front
of
her
window
and
smiling
very
pleasantly
said
how
shall
i
find
the
way
to
your
room
jennie
pointed
to
an
alley
near
by
where
he
turned
in
and
with
some
difficulty
found
his
way
to
the
dingy
staircase
opening
the
door
to
jennie
gentle
come
in
he
said
i
have
brought
you
a
handful
of
flowers
to
look
at
this
rainy
day
are
they
for
me
exclaimed
jennie
clapping
her
hands
in
delight
how
kind
you
are
she
continued
as
george
laid
them
in
her
lap
i
have
not
had
a
flower
since
we
live
in
the
city
did
you
use
to
live
in
the
country
asked
george
oh
yes
answered
jennie
we
used
to
live
in
a
beautiful
cottage
and
there
were
trees
and
flowers
and
green
grass
and
the
air
was
so
sweet
well
what
made
you
move
here
oh
said
jennie
softly
papa
died
and
mamma
was
sick
so
long
that
the
money
was
all
gone
then
mamma
had
to
sell
the
cottage
and
she
moved
here
to
try
to
get
work
to
do
do
you
have
to
sit
here
all
day
asked
george
glancing
around
the
bare
room
and
out
into
the
dismal
street
yes
said
jennie
because
i
am
lame
but
i
would
not
care
for
that
if
i
could
only
help
mamma
i
declare
it
too
had
said
george
who
dreaded
nothing
so
much
as
being
obliged
to
stay
in
the
house
oh
no
it
is
said
jennie
pleasantly
mamma
says
maybe
we
should
forget
the
lord
if
we
had
everything
we
wanted
and
he
never
forgets
us
you
know
well
i
must
rush
for
school
said
george
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
say
next
and
he
was
soon
out
of
jennie
sight
but
had
a
happy
little
corner
in
his
heart
because
he
had
tried
to
do
a
kind
act
he
did
not
know
how
much
good
he
had
done
in
making
a
pleasant
day
out
of
a
dreary
one
for
a
little
sick
girl
mamma
said
george
that
evening
after
he
had
told
her
what
jennie
said
papa
must
give
them
some
money
so
they
can
go
back
to
their
home
no
said
his
mother
he
can
not
do
that
and
they
would
not
wish
him
to
do
so
but
perhaps
he
can
help
us
contrive
some
way
to
assist
them
so
that
they
can
live
more
comfortably
i
am
going
to
carry
jennie
some
of
the
grapes
grandpa
sent
me
said
george
turning
over
the
leaves
of
his
geography
i
will
put
some
of
my
pears
into
your
basket
and
go
with
you
said
his
mother
but
there
is
one
thing
we
can
always
give
and
sometimes
it
does
more
good
than
nice
things
to
eat
or
even
money
what
is
that
mamma
smiles
asked
george
looking
up
yes
answered
his
mother
and
it
is
a
good
plan
to
throw
in
a
kind
word
or
two
with
them
when
you
can
gloomy
cheerless
with
desire
imperfect
worn
out
dark
looking
about
quickly
comfortless
gloomy
to
plan
what
is
the
subject
of
this
lesson
how
did
george
west
make
the
day
pleasant
for
jennie
what
did
his
mother
suggest
what
happened
next
day
what
did
jennie
tell
george
about
her
life
relate
what
happened
at
george
home
that
evening
what
does
the
lesson
teach
vii
lazy
ned
is
royal
fun
cried
lazy
ned
to
coast
upon
my
fine
new
sled
and
beat
the
other
boys
but
then
i
can
not
bear
to
climb
the
tiresome
hill
for
every
time
it
more
and
more
annoys
so
while
his
schoolmates
glided
by
and
gladly
tugged
uphill
to
try
another
merry
race
too
indolent
to
share
their
plays
ned
was
compelled
to
stand
and
gaze
while
shivering
in
his
place
thus
he
would
never
take
the
pains
to
seek
the
prize
that
labor
gains
until
the
time
had
passed
for
all
his
life
he
dreaded
still
the
silly
bugbear
of
uphill
and
died
a
dunce
at
last
excellent
noble
coast
to
slide
an
noys

lazy
prize
a
reward

frightful

the
monkey
the
monkey
is
a
very
cunning
little
animal
and
is
found
in
many
parts
of
the
world
a
lady
once
had
a
monkey
which
had
been
brought
to
her
as
a
present
this
monkey
like
all
others
was
very
fond
of
mischief
and
of
doing
whatever
he
saw
others
do
his
mistress
found
him
one
day
sitting
on
her
toilet
table
holding
in
one
hand
a
little
china
mug
with
water
in
it
and
in
the
other
her
toothbrush
with
which
he
was
cleaning
his
teeth
looking
all
the
time
in
the
glass
her
little
daughter
maria
had
a
large
doll
with
a
very
handsome
head
and
face
she
one
day
left
this
doll
in
the
cradle
and
went
out
of
the
room
the
monkey
came
in
took
the
doll
in
his
arms
and
jumping
upon
the
washstand
he
began
to
wash
its
face
he
first
rubbed
it
all
over
with
soap
then
seizing
the
towel
he
dipped
it
in
the
wash
bowl
and
rubbed
it
so
hard
that
the
doll
face
was
entirely
spoiled
the
paint
being
all
washed
off
there
have
been
many
tales
of
monkeys
who
armed
with
sticks
have
joined
together
and
made
war
or
resisted
their
enemies
with
great
effect
these
are
not
true
as
it
is
known
that
in
their
native
state
monkeys
have
no
idea
of
weapons
the
sticks
and
other
missiles
said
to
be
thrown
at
travelers
as
they
pass
under
the
branches
of
trees
are
usually
the
dead
branches
accidentally
broken
off
as
the
monkeys
with
the
natural
curiosity
of
their
tribe
pass
along
the
tops
of
trees
to
watch
the
actions
of
the
people
below
they
can
however
be
taught
to
use
a
stick
and
to
use
it
well
some
time
ago
two
italians
together
owned
an
organ
and
a
monkey
by
means
of
which
they
earned
their
living
during
one
of
their
exhibitions
a
dog
flew
at
the
little
monkey
which
made
its
owners
very
angry
they
and
the
owner
of
the
dog
quarreled
about
it
and
at
last
it
was
agreed
that
the
dog
and
the
monkey
should
fight
it
out
the
monkey
because
he
was
smaller
was
to
be
allowed
a
stick
the
monkey
was
taught
what
he
was
to
do
in
the
following
manner
one
of
the
italians
crawled
on
his
hands
and
knees
barking
like
a
dog
while
the
other
got
on
his
back
grasped
his
hair
and
beat
him
about
the
head
with
a
stick
the
monkey
looked
on
with
great
gravity
and
when
the
instruction
was
over
received
the
stick
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
knew
his
work
and
meant
to
do
it
everything
being
settled
the
dog
flew
at
the
monkey
with
open
month
the
monkey
immediately
leaped
on
his
back
and
grasping
the
dog
ear
beat
away
at
his
head
with
such
good
will
that
his
adversary
speedily
gave
in
the
monkey
however
was
not
content
with
a
mere
victory
but
continued
pounding
at
the
dog
head

how
one
ugly
trick
has
spoiled

matilda
though
a
pleasant
child
one
grievous

possessed
which
like

all

her
grand
mamma
went
out
one
day
and
by
mistake
she
laid
her
spectacles
and
snuffbox
gay
too
near
the
little
maid
ah
well
thought
she
i
try
them
on
as
soon
as
grand
mamma
is
gone
forthwith
she
placed
upon
her
nose
the
glasses
large
and
wide
and
looking
round
as
i
suppose
the
snuffbox
too
she
spied
oh
what
a
pretty
box
is
this
i
open
it
said
little
miss
i
know
that
grandmamma
would
say
meddle
with
it
dear
but
then
she
far
enough
away
and
no
one
else
is
near
beside
what
can
there
be
amiss
in
opening
such
a

the

there
was
once
a
jeweler
noted
for
many
virtues
one
day
the
jewish
elders
came
to
him
to
buy
some
diamonds
to
put
upon
that
part
of
the
dress
of
their
high
priest
which
the
bible
calls
an
ephod
they
told
him
what
they
wanted
and
offered
him
a
fair
price
for
the
diamonds
he
replied
that
he
could
not
let
them
see
the
jewels
at
that
moment
and
requested
them
to
call
again
as
they
wanted
them
without
delay
and
thought
that
the
object
of
the
jeweler
was
only
to
increase
the
price
of
the
diamonds
the
elders
offered
him
twice
then
three
times
as
much
as
they
were
worth
but
he
still
refused
and
they
went
away
in
very
bad
humor
some
hours
after
he
went
to
them
and
placed
before
them
the
diamonds
for
which
they
again
offered
him
the
last
price
they
had
named
but
he
said
i
will
only
accept
the
first
one
you
offered
to
me
this
morning
why
then
did
you
not
close
with
us
at
once
asked
they
in
surprise
when
you
came
replied
he
my
father
had
the
key
of
the
chest
in
which
the
diamonds
were
kept
and
as
he
was
asleep
i

have
been

him

not

to
my

take
from
him
a

comfort
the
elders
affected
by
these
feeling
words
spread
their
hands
upon
the
jeweler

and
said
thou
shalt
be

henry
bond
was
about
ten
years
old
when
his
father
died
his
mother
found
it
difficult
to
provide
for
the
support
of
a
large
family
thus
left
entirely
in
her
care
by
good
management
however
she
contrived
to
do
so
and
also
to
send
henry
the
oldest
to
school
and
to
supply
him
for
the
most
part
with
such
books
as
he
needed
at
one
time
however
henry
wanted
a
grammar
in
order
to
join
a
class
in
that
study
and
his
mother
could
not
furnish
him
with
the
money
to
buy
it
he
was
very
much
troubled
about
it
and
went
to
bed
with
a
heavy
heart
thinking
what
could
be
done
on
waking
in
the
morning
he
found
that
a
deep
snow
had
fallen
and
the
cold
wind
was
blowing
furiously
ah
said
he
it
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
he
rose
ran
to
the
house
of
a
neighbor
and
offered
his
service
to
clear
a
path
around
his
premises
the
offer
was
accepted
having
completed
this
work
and
received
his
pay
he
went
to
another
place
for
the
same
purpose
and
then
to
another
until
he
had
earned
enough
to
buy
a
grammar
when
school
commenced
henry
was
in
his
seat
the
happiest
boy
there
ready
to
begin
the
lesson
in

from
that
time
henry
was
always
the

active
boy
twelve
years
old
liscom
looking
pale
and
worn
was
moving
languidly
about
trying
to
clear
away
the
breakfast
she
had
scarcely
tasted
she
smiled
and
said
you
fred
you
wash
dishes
yes
indeed
mother
replied
fred
i
should
be
a
poor
scholar
if
i
could
when
i
seen
you
do
it
so
many
times
just
try
me
a
look
of
relief
came
over
his
mother
face
as
she
seated
herself
in
her
low
fred
washed
the
dishes
and
put
them
in
the
closet
he
then
swept
the
kitchen
brought
up
the
potatoes
from
the
cellar
for
the
dinner
and
washed
them
and
then
set
out
for
school
fred
father
was
away
from
home
and
as
there
was
some
cold
meat
in
the
pantry
liscom
found
it
an
easy
task
to
prepare
dinner
fred
hurried
home
from
school
set
the
table
and
again
washed
the
dishes
he
kept
on
in
this
way
for
two
or
three
days
till
his
mother
was
able
to
resume
her
usual
work
and
he
felt
amply
rewarded
when
the
doctor
who
happened
in
one
day
said
well
madam
it
my
opinion
that
you
would
have
been
very
sick
if
you
had
not
kept
quiet
the
doctor
did
not
know
how
the
quiet
had
been
secured
nor
how
the
boy
heart
bounded
at
his
words
fred
had
given
up
a
great
deal
of
what
boys
hold
dear
for
the
purpose
of
helping
his
mother
coasting
and
skating
being
just
at
this
time
in
perfection
besides
this
his
temper
and
his
patience
had
been
severely
tried
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
going
early
to
school
and
staying
to
play
after
it
was
dismissed
the
boys
missed
him
and
their
curiosity
was
excited
when
he
would
give
no
other
reason
for
not
coming
to
school
earlier
or
staying
after
school
than
that
he
was
a
wanted
at
home
i
tell
you
said
tom
barton
i
find
him
out
boys
see
if
i
do
so
he
called
for
fred
to
go
to
school
and
on
his
way
to
the
side
door
walked
lightly
and
somewhat
nearer
the
kitchen
window
than
was
absolutely
needful
looking
in
he
saw
fred
standing
at
the
table
with
a
dishcloth
in
his
hand
of
course
he
reported
this
at
school
and
various
were
the
greetings
poor
fred
received
at
recess
well
you
a
brave
one
to
stay
at
home
washing
dishes
girl
boy
pretty
bessie
lost
your
apron
have
you
polly
fred
was
not
wanting
either
in
spirit
or
courage
and
he
was
strongly
tempted
to
resent
these
insults
and
to
fight
some
of
his
tormentors
but
his
consciousness
of
right
and
his
love
for
his
mother
helped
him
while
he
was
struggling
for
self
mastery
his
teacher
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
schoolhouse
fred
caught
his
eye
and
it
seemed
to
look
if
it
did
not
say
do
give
up
be
really
brave
he
knew
the
teacher
had
heard
the
insulting
taunts
of
his
thoughtless
schoolmates
the
boys
received
notice
during
the
day
that
fred
must
not
be
taunted
or
teased
in
any
manner
they
knew
that
the
teacher
meant
what
he
said
and
so
the
brave
little
boy
had
no
farther
trouble
feebly
fully
judgment
belief
wholly
entirely
to
consider
as
an
injury
inward
feeling
knowledge
of
what
passes
in
one
own
mind
why
did
fred
offer
to
wash
the
dishes
was
it
a
disgraceful
thing
to
do
how
was
he
rewarded
how
did
his
schoolmates
show
their
lack
of
manliness

the
cry
crept
out
on

and
the

bells
began
to
ring
fred
was
wakened
by
the
alarm
and
the
red
light
streaming
into
his
room
he
dressed
himself
in
a
moment
almost
and
tapped
at
the
door
of
his
mother
bedroom
it
is
barton
house
mother
do
let
me
go
he
said
in
eager
excited
tones
liscom
thought
a
moment
he
was
young
but
she
could
trust
him
and
she
knew
how
much
his
heart
was
in
the
request
yes
you
may
go
she
answered
but
be
careful
my
boy
if
you
can
help
do
so
but
do
nothing
rashly
fred
promised
to
follow
her
advice
and
hurried
to
the
fire
and
barton
were
not
at
home
the
house
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
servants
the
fire
spread
with
fearful
speed
for
there
was
a
high
wind
and
it
was
found
impossible
to
save
the
house
the
servants
ran
about
screaming
and
lamenting
but
doing
nothing
to
any
purpose
fred
found
tom
outside
in
safety
where
is
katy
he
asked
tom
trembling
with
terror
seemed
to
have
had
no
thought
but
of
his
own
escape
he
said
katy
is
in
the
house
in
what
room
asked
fred
in
that
one
pointing
to
a
window
in
the
upper
story
it
was
no
time
for
words
but
for
instant
vigorous
action
the
staircase
was
already
on
fire
there
was
but
one
way
to
reach
katy
and
that
full
of
danger
the
second
floor
might
fall
at
any
moment
and
fred
knew
it
but
he
trusted
in
an
arm
stronger
than
his
own
and
silently
sought
help
and
guidance
a
ladder
was
quickly
brought
and
placed
against
the
house
fred
mounted
it
followed
by
the
hired
man
dashed
in
the
sash
of
the
window
and
pushed
his
way
into
the
room
where
the
poor
child
lay
nearly
suffocated
with
smoke
he
roused
her
with
some
difficulty
carried
her
to
the
window
and
placed
her
upon
the
sill
she
was
instantly
grasped
by
strong
arms
and
carried
down
the
ladder
fred
following
as
fast
as
possible
they
had
scarcely
reached
the
ground
before
a
crash
of
falling
timbers
told
them
that
they
had
barely
escaped
with
their
lives
tom
barton
never
forgot
the
lesson
of
that
night
and
he
came
to
believe
and
to
act
upon
the
belief
in
after
years
that
true
manliness
is
in
harmony
with
gentleness
kindness
and
relate
the
story
of
the
fire
what
is
meant
by
to
any
purpose
in

show
any

xvii
a
ship
in
a
storm
did
you
ever
go
far
out
upon
the
great
ocean
how
beautiful
it
is
to
be
out
at
sea
when
the
sea
is
smooth
and
still
let
a
storm
approach
and
the
scene
is
changed
the
heavy
black
clouds
appear
in
the
distance
and
throw
a
deep
deathlike
shade
over
the
world
of
waters
the
captain
and
sailors
soon
see
in
the
clouds
the
signs
of
evil
all
hands
are
then
set
to
work
to
take
in
sail
the
hoarse
notes
of
the
captain
speaking
through
his
trumpet
are
echoed
from
lip
to
lip
among
the
rigging
happy
will
it
be
if
all
is
made
snug
before
the
gale
strikes
the
vessel
at
last
the
gale
comes
like
a
vast
moving
mountain
of
air
it
strikes
the
ship
the
vessel
heaves
and
groans
under
the
dreadful
weight
and
struggles
to
escape
through
the
foaming
waters
if
she
is
far
out
at
sea
she
will
be
likely
to
ride
out
the
storm
in
safety
but
if
the
wind
is
driving
her
upon
the
shore
the
poor
sailors
will
hardly
escape
being
dashed
upon
the
rocks
and
drowned
once
there
was
a
ship
in
a
storm
some
of
her
masts
were
already
broken
and
her
sails
lost
while
the
wind
was
raging
and
the
billows
were
dashing
against
her
the
cry
was
heard
a
man
has
fallen
overboard
quickly
was
the
boat
lowered
and
she
was
soon
seen
bounding
on
her
way
over
the
mountain
waves
at
one
moment
the
boat
seemed
lifted
to
the
skies
and
the
next
it
sank
down
and
appeared
to
be
lost
beneath
the
waves
at
length
the
man
was
found
he
was
well
nigh
drowned
but
he
was
taken
on
board
and
now
they
made
for
the
ship
but
the
ship
rolled
so
dreadfully
that
it
seemed
certain
death
to
go
near
her
and
now
what
should
they
do
the
captain
told
one
of
the
men
to
go
aloft
and
throw
down
a
rope
this
was
made
fast
to
the
boat
and
when
the
sea
was
somewhat
calm
it
was
hoisted
and
all
fell
down
into
the
ship
with
a
dreadful
crash
it
was
a
desperate
way
of
getting
on
board
but
fortunately
no
lives
were
lost
on
the
dangerous
points
along
our
seacoast
are
lighthouses
which
can
be
seen
far
out
at
sea
and
serve
as
guides
to
ships
sometimes
the
fog
is
so
dense
that
these
lights
can
not
be
seen
but
most
lighthouses
have
great
fog
bells
or
fog
horns
some
of
the
latter
are
made
to
sound
by
steam
and
can
be
heard
for
a
long
distance
these
bells
and
horns
are
kept
sounding
as
long
as
the
fog
lasts
there
are
also
many
stations
along
the
coast
where
trained
men
are
ready
with
lifeboats
when
a
ship
is
driven
ashore
they
at
once
go
to
the
rescue
of
those
on
board
and
thus
many
valuable
lives
are
saved
take
it
all
in
all
a
sailor
life
is
a
very
hard
one
our
young
friends
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude

whose

is

two
ways
of
telling
a
story
by
henry
oliver
in
one
of
the
most
populous
cities
of
new
england
a
few
years
ago
a
party
of
lads
all
members
of
the
same
school
got
up
a
grand
sleigh
ride
the
sleigh
was
a
very
large
one
drawn
by
six
gray
horses
on
the
following
day
as
the
teacher
entered
the
schoolroom
he
found
his
pupils
in
high
glee
as
they
chattered
about
the
fun
and
frolic
of
their
excursion
in
answer
to
some
inquiries
one
of
the
lads
gave
him
an
account
of
their
trip
and
its
various
incidents
as
he
drew
near
the
end
of
his
story
he
exclaimed
oh
sir
there
was
one
thing
i
had
almost
forgotten
as
we
were
coming
home
we
saw
ahead
of
us
a
queer
looking
affair
in
the
road
it
proved
to
be
a
rusty
old
sleigh
fastened
behind
a
covered
wagon
proceeding
at
a
very
slow
rate
and
taking
up
the
whole
road
finding
that
the
owner
was
not
disposed
to
turn
out
we
determined
upon
a
volley
of
snowballs
and
a
good
hurrah
they
produced
the
right
effect
for
the
crazy
machine
turned
out
into
the
deep
snow
and
the
skinny
old
pony
started
on
a
full
trot
as
we
passed
some
one
gave
the
horse
a
good
crack
which
made
him
run
faster
than
he
ever
did
before
i
warrant
with
that
an
old
fellow
in
the
wagon
who
was
buried
up
under
an
old
hat
bawled
out
do
you
frighten
my
horse
do
you
turn
out
then
says
the
driver
so
we
gave
him
three
rousing
cheers
more
his
horse
was
frightened
again
and
ran
up
against
a
loaded
wagon
and
i
believe
almost
capsized
the
old
creature
and
so
we
left
him
well
boys
replied
the
teacher
take
your
seat
and
i
will
tell
you
a
story
and
all
about
a
sleigh
ride
too
yesterday
afternoon
a
very
venerable
old
clergyman
was
on
his
way
from
boston
to
salem
to
pass
the
rest
of
the
winter
at
the
house
of
his
son
that
he
might
be
prepared
for
journeying
in
the
following
spring
he
took
with
him
his
wagon
and
for
the
winter
his
sleigh
which
he
fastened
behind
the
wagon
his
sight
and
hearing
were
somewhat
blunted
by
age
and
he
was
proceeding
very
slowly
for
his
horse
was
old
and
feeble
like
his
owner
he
was
suddenly
disturbed
by
loud
hurrahs
from
behind
and
by
a
furious
pelting
of
balls
of
snow
and
ice
upon
the
top
of
his
wagon
in
his
alarm
he
dropped
his
reins
and
his
horse
began
to
run
away
in
the
midst
of
the
old
man
trouble
there
rushed
by
him
with
loud
shouts
a
large
party
of
boys
in
a
sleigh
drawn
by
six
horses
out
turn
out
old
fellow
us
the
road
will
you
take
for
your
pony
the
price
of
oats
old
man
were
the
various
cries
that
met
his
cars
do
not
frighten
my
horse
exclaimed
the
infirm
driver
out
then
turn
out
was
the
answer
which
was
followed
by
repeated
cracks
and
blows
from
the
long
whip
of
the
sleigh
with
showers
of
snowballs
and
three
tremendous
hurrahs
from
the
boys
the
terror
of
the
old
man
and
his
horse
was
increased
and
the
latter
ran
away
with
him
to
the
great
danger
of
his
life
he
contrived
however
to
stop
his
horse
just
in
season
to
prevent
his
being
dashed
against
a
loaded
wagon
a
short
distance
brought
him
to
the
house
of
his
son
that
son
boys
is
your
instructor
and
that
fellow
was
your
father
when
the
boys
perceived
how
rude
and
unkind
their
conduct
appeared
from
another
point
of
view
they
were
very
much
ashamed
of
their
thoughtlessness
and
most
of
them
had
the
manliness
to
apologize
to
their
teacher
for
what
they
had
done

vermont
in

published

volumes
of
poems

for
children
and
one
collection
of
prose
articles
entitled
gathered
leaves
she
died
in
the
frost
looked
forth
one
still
clear
night
and
whispered
now
i
shall
be
out
of
sight
so
through
the
valley
and
over
the
height
in
silence
i
take
my
way
i
will
not
go
on
like
that
blustering
train
the
wind

the
snow
the
hail
and
the
rain
who
make
so
much
bustle
and
noise
in
vain
but
i
be
as
busy
as
they
then
he
flew
to
the
mountain
and
powdered
its
crest
he
lit
on
the
trees
and
their
boughs
he
dressed
in
diamond
beads
and
over
the
breast
of
the
quivering
lake
he
spread
a
coat
of
mail
that
it
need
not
fear
the
downward
point
of
many
a
spear
that
he
hung
on
its
margin
far
and
near
where
a
rock
could
rear
its
head
he
went
to
the
windows
of
those
who
slept
and
over
each
pane
like
a
fairy
crept
wherever
he
breathed
wherever
he
stepped
by
the
light
of
the
morn
were
seen
most
beautiful
things
there
were
flowers
and
trees
there
were

of
birds
and
swarms
of
bees
there
were
cities
with
temples
and
towers
and
these
all
pictured
in
silver
sheen
but
he
did
one
thing
that
was
hardly
fair
he
peeped
in
the
cupboard
and
finding
there
that
all
had
forgotten
for
him
to
prepare
now
just
to

i

jones
boys
if
you
have
nothing
to
do
will
you
unpack
these
parcels
for
me
the
two
parcels
were
exactly
alike
both
of
them
well
tied
up
with
good
whipcord
ben
took
his
parcel
to
the
table
and
began
to
examine
the
knot
and
then
to
untie
it
john
took
the
other
parcel
and
tried
first
at
one
corner
and
then
at
the
other
to
pull
off
the
string
but
the
cord
had
been
too
well
secured
and
he
only
drew
the
knots
tighter
john
i
wish
these
people
would
not
tie
up
their
parcels
so
tightly
as
if
they
were
never
to
be
undone
why
ben
how
did
you
get
yours
undone
what
is
in
your
parcel
i
wonder
what
is
in
mine
i
wish
i
could
get
the
string
off
i
will
cut
it
ben
oh
no
do
not
cut
it
john
look
what
a
nice
cord
this
is
and
yours
is
the
same
it
is
a
pity
to
cut
it
john
pooh
what
signifies
a
bit
of
pack
thread
ben
it
is
whipcord
john
well
whipcord
then
what
signifies
a
bit
of
whipcord
you
can
get
a
piece
of
whipcord
twice
as
long
as
that
for
three
cents
and
who
cares
for
three
cents
not
i
for
one
so
here
it
goes
so
he
took
out
his
knife
and
cut
it
in
several
places
jones
well
my
boys
have
you
undone
the
parcels
for
me
john
yes
sir
here
is
the
parcel

the
string
ben
ben
thank
you
sir
what
excellent
whipcord
it
is
jones
and
you
john
may
keep
your
string
too
if
it
will
be
of
any
use
to
you
john
it
will
be
of
no
use
to
me
thank
you
sir
jones
no
i
am
afraid
not
if
this
is
it
a
few
weeks
after
this
jones
gave
each
of
his
sons
a
new
top
john
how
is
this
ben
these
tops
have
no
strings
what
shall
we
do
for
strings
ben
i
have
a
string
that
will
do
very
well
for
mine
and
he
pulled
it
out
of
his
pocket
john
why
if
that
is
not
the
whipcord
i
wish
i
had
saved
mine
a
few
days
afterward
there
was
a
shooting
match
with
bows
and
arrows
among
the
lads
the
prize
was
a
fine
bow
and
arrows
to
be
given
to
the
best
marksman
come
come
said
master
sharp
i
am
within
one
inch
of
the
mark
i
should
like
to
see
who
will
go
nearer
john
drew
his
bow
and
shot
the
arrow
struck
within
a
quarter
of
an
inch
of
master
sharp
shoot
away
said
sharp
but
you
must
understand
the
rules
we
settled
them
before
you
came
you
are
to
have
three
shots
with
your
own
arrows
nobody
is
to
borrow
or
lend
so
shoot
away
john
seized
his
second
arrow
if
i
have
any
luck
said
he
but
just
as
he
pronounced
the
word
luck
the
string
broke
and
the
arrow
fell
from
his
hands
master
sharp
there
it
is
all
over
with
you
ben
here
is
my
bow
for
him
and
welcome
master
sharp
no

is
not
fair
did
you
not
hear
the
rules
there
is
to
be
no
lending
it
was
now
ben
turn
to
make
his
trial
his
first
arrow
missed
the
mark
the
second
was
exactly
as
near
as
john
first
before
venturing
the
last
arrow
ben
very
prudently
examined
the
string
of
his
bow
and
as
he
pulled
it
to
try
its
strength
it
snapped
master
sharp
clapped
his
hands
and
danced
for
joy
but
his
dancing
suddenly
ceased
when
careful
ben
drew
out
of
his
pocket
an
excellent
piece
of
cord
and
began
to
tie
it
to
the
bow
the
everlasting
whipcord
i
declare
cried
john
yes
said
ben
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
today
because
i
thought
i
might
want
it
ben
last
arrow
won
the
prize
and
when
the
bow
and
arrows
were
handed
to
him
john
said
how
valuable
that
whipcord
has
been
to
you
ben
i
take
care
how
i
waste
anything

the
lion
the
lion
is
often
called
the
king
of
beasts
his
height
varies
from
three
to
four
feet
and
he
is
from
six
to
nine
feet
long
his
coat
is
of
it
yellowish
brown
or
tawny
color
and
about
his
neck
is
a
great
shaggy
mane
which
gives
his
head
a
majestic
appearance
the
strength
of
the
lion
is
so
great
that
he
can
easily
crush
the
skulls
of
such
animals
as
the
horse
or
ox
with
one
blow
of
his
paw
no
one
who
has
not
seen
the
teeth
of
a
full
grown
lion
taken
out
of
their
sockets
can
have
any
idea
of
their
real
size
one
of
them
forms
a
good
handful
and
might
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
small
elephant
tooth
the
home
of
the
lion
is
in
the
forests
of
asia
and
africa
where
he
is
a
terror
to
man
and
beast
he
generally
lies
concealed
during
the
day
but
as
darkness
comes
on
he
prowls
about
where
other
animals
are
accustomed
to
go
for
food
or
drink
and
springs
upon
them
unawares
with
a
roar
that
sounds
like
the
rumble
of
thunder
the
lion
sometimes
lives
to
a
great
age
one
by
the
name
of
pompey
died
at
london
in
the
year
at
the
age
of
seventy
years
if
taken
when
young
the
lion
can
be
tamed
and
will
even
show
marks
of
kindness
to
his
keeper
in
a
menagerie
at
brussels
there
was
a
cell
where
a
large
lion
called
danco
used
to
be
kept
the
cell
happened
to
be
in
need
of
repair
and
the
keeper
whose
name
was
william
desired
a
carpenter
to
come
and
mend
it
the
carpenter
came
but
was
so
afraid
of
the
lion
that
he
would
not
go
near
the
cell
alone
so
william
entered
the
cell
and
led
the
lion
to
the
upper
part
of
it
while
the
other
part
was
refitting
he
played
with
the
lion
for
some
time
but
at
last
being
wearied
both
he
and
the
lion
fell
asleep
the
carpenter
went
on
with
his
work
and
when
he
had
finished
he
called
out
for
william
to
come
and
see
it
he
called
again
and
again
but
no
william
answered
the
poor
carpenter
began
to
be
frightened
lest
the
lion
had
made
his
dinner
of
the
keeper
or
else
crushed
him
with
his
great
paws
he
crept
round
to
the
upper
part
of
the
cell
and
there
looking
through
the
railing
he
saw
the
lion
and
william
sleeping
side
by
side
as
contentedly
as
two
little
brothers
he
was
so
astonished
that
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
the
lion
awakened
by
the
noise
stared
at
the
carpenter
with
an
eye
of
fury
and
then
placing
his
paw
on
the
breast
of
his
keeper
as
if
to
say
touch
him
if
you
dare
the
heroic
beast
lay
down
to
sleep
again
the
carpenter
was
dreadfully
alarmed
and
not
knowing
how
he
could
rouse
william
he
ran
out
and
related
what
he
had
seen
some
people
came
and
opening
the
door
of
the
cell
contrived
to
awaken
the
keeper
who
rubbing
his
eyes
quietly
looked
around
him
and
expressed
himself
very
well
satisfied
with
his
nap
he
took
the
paw
shook
it
kindly
and
then
retired

six

from

parted

and
laid
her
head
on

bed
to
hear
what
the
berries
said
their
cheeks
were
blushing
their
breath
was
sweet
she
could
almost
hear

hearts
beat

the

when

fly

harry
riches
one
day
our
little
harry
spent
the
morning
with
his
young
playmate
johnny
crane
who
lived
in
a
fine
house
and
on
sundays
rode
to
church
in
the
grandest
carriage
to
be
seen
in
all
the
country
round
when
harry
returned
home
he
said
mother
johnny
has
money
in
both
pockets
has
he
dear
yes
and
he
says
he
could
get
ever
so
much
more
if
he
wanted
it
well
now
that
very
pleasant
for
him
i
returned
cheerfully
as
a
reply
was
plainly
expected
very
pleasant
do
you
think
so
yes
only
only
what
harry
why
he
has
a
big
popgun
and
a
watch
and
a
hobbyhorse
and
lots
of
things
and
harry
looked
up
at
my
face
with
a
disconsolate
stare
well
my
boy
what
of
that
nothing
mother
and
the
telltale
tears
sprang
to
his
eyes
only
i
guess
we
are
very
poor
are
we
no
indeed
harry
we
are
very
far
from
being
poor
we
are
not
so
rich
as
crane
family
if
that
is
what
you
mean
o
mother
insisted
the
little
fellow
i
do
think
we
are
very
poor
anyhow
i
am
o
harry
i
exclaimed
reproachfully
yes
i
am
he
sobbed
i
have
scarcely
any
thing
i
mean
anything
that
worth
money
except
things
to
eat
and
wear
and
i
have
to
have
them
anyway
have
to
have
them
i
echoed
at
the
same
time
laying
my
sewing
upon
the
table
so
that
i
might
reason
with
him
on
that
point
do
you
not
know
my
son
just
then
uncle
ben
looked
up
from
the
paper
he
had
been
reading
harry
said
he
i
want
to
find
out
something
about
eyes
so
if
you
will
let
me
have
yours
i
will
give
you
a
dollar
apiece
for
them
for
my
eyes
exclaimed
harry
very
much
astonished
yes
resumed
uncle
ben
quietly
for
your
eyes
i
will
give
you
chloroform
so
it
will
not
hurt
you
in
the
least
and
you
shall
have
a
beautiful
glass
pair
for
nothing
to
wear
in
their
place
come
a
dollar
apiece
cash
down
what
do
you
say
i
will
take
them
out
as
quick
as
a
wink
give
you
my
eyes
uncle
cried
harry
looking
wild
at
the
very
thought
i
think
not
and
the
startled
little
fellow
shook
his
head
defiantly
well
five
ten
twenty
dollars
then
harry
shook
his
head
at
every
offer
no
sir
i
would
let
you
have
them
for
a
thousand
dollars
what
could
i
do
without
my
eyes
i
could
see
mother
nor
the
baby
nor
the
flowers
nor
the
horses
nor
anything
added
harry
growing
warmer
and
warmer
i
will
give
you
two
thousand
urged
uncle
ben
taking
a
roll
of
bank
notes
out
of
his
pocket
harry
standing
at
a
respectful
distance
shouted
that
he
never
would
do
any
such
thing
very
well
continued
the
uncle
with
a
serious
air
at
the
same
time
writing
something
in
his
notebook
i
ca
afford
to
give
you
more
than
two
thousand
dollars
so
i
shall
have
to
do
without
your
eyes
but
he
added
i
will
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
give
you
twenty
dollars
if
you
will
let
me
put
a
few
drops
from
this
bottle
in
your
ears
it
will
not
hurt
but
it
will
make
you
deaf
i
want
to
try
some
experiments
with
deafness
you
see
come
quickly
now
here
are
the
twenty
dollars
all
ready
for
you
make
me
deaf
shouted
harry
without
even
looking
at
the
gold
pieces
temptingly
displayed
upon
the
table
i
guess
you
will
not
do
that
either
why
i
could
hear
a
single
word
if
i
were
deaf
could
i
probably
not
replied
uncle
ben
so
of
course
harry
refused
again
he
would
never
give
up
his
hearing
he
said
no
not
for
three
thousand
dollars
uncle
ben
made
another
note
in
his
book
and
then
came
out
with
large
bids
for
a
right
arm
then
left
arm
hands
feet
nose
finally
ending
with
an
offer
of
ten
thousand
dollars
for
mother
and
five
thousand
for
the
baby
to
all
of
these
offers
harry
shook
his
head
his
eyes
flashing
and
exclamations
of
surprise
and
indignation
bursting
from
his
lips
at
last
uncle
ben
said
he
must
give
up
his
experiments
for
harry
prices
were
entirely
too
high
ha
ha
laughed
the
boy
exultingly
and
he
folded
his
dimpled
arms
and
looked
as
if
to
say
i
like
to
see
the
man
who
could
pay
them
why
harry
look
here
exclaimed
uncle
ben
peeping
into
his
notebook
here
is
a
big
addition
sum
i
tell
you
he
added
the
numbers
and
they
amounted
to
thousand
dollars
there
harry
said
uncle
ben
do
you
think
you
are
foolish
not
to
accept
some
of
my
offers
no
sir
i
do
answered
harry
resolutely
then
said
uncle
ben
you
talk
of
being
poor
and
by
your
own
showing
you
have
treasures
for
which
you
will
not
take
thousand
dollars
what
do
you
say
to
that
harry
did
know
exactly
what
to
say
so
he
blushed
for
a
second
and
just
then
tears
came
rolling
down
his
cheeks
and
he
threw
his
chubby
arms
around
my
neck
mother
he
whispered
is
god
good
to
make
everybody
so
rich
filled
with
grief
with
censure
or
reproof
an
oily
liquid
the
vapor
of
which
causes
insensibility
startled
shocked
daringly
to
be
able
to
pay
for
acts
performed
to
discover
some
truth
expressions
of
surprise
anger
etc
in
a
triumphant
manner
things
which
are
very
much

just
out
of
the
dog
reach
and
the
obedient
frisk
squatted
himself
on
his
hind
legs
and
held
up
his
fore
paws
waiting
for
master
harry
to
give
him
the
tempting
morsel
the
little
boy
and
the
little
dog
were
great
friends
frisk
loved
him
dearly
much
better
than
he
did
anyone
else
perhaps
because
he
recollected
that
harry
was
his
earliest
and
firmest
friend
during
a
time
of
great
trouble
poor
frisk
had
come
as
a
stray
dog
to
milton
the
place
where
harry
lived
if
he
could
have
told
his
own
story
it
would
probably
have
been
a
very
pitiful
one
of
kicks
and
cuffs
of
hunger
and
foul
weather
certain
it
is
he
made
his
appearance
at
the
very
door
where
harry
was
now
sitting
in
miserable
plight
wet
dirty
and
half
starved
and
that
there
he
met
harry
who
took
a
fancy
to
him
and
harry
grandmother
who
drove
him
off
with
a
broom
harry
at
length
obtained
permission
for
the
little
dog
to
remain
as
a
sort
of
outdoor
pensioner
and
fed
him
with
stray
bones
and
cold
potatoes
and
such
things
as
he
could
get
for
him
he
also
provided
him
with
a
little
basket
to
sleep
in
the
very
same
which
turned
up
afterward
served
harry
for
a
seat
after
a
while
having
proved
his
good
qualities
by
barking
away
a
set
of
pilferers
who
were
making
an
attack
on
the
great
pear
tree
he
was
admitted
into
the
house
and
became
one
of
its
most
vigilant
and
valued
inmates
he
could
fetch
or
carry
either
by
land
or
water
would
pick
up
a
thimble
or
a
ball
of
cotton
if
little
annie
should
happen
to
drop
them
or
take
harry
dinner
to
school
for
him
with
perfect
honesty
beg
frisk
beg
said
harry
and
gave
him
after
long
waiting
the
expected
morsel
frisk
was
satisfied
but
harry
was
not
the
little
boy
though
a
fellow
in
the
main
had
turns
of
naughtiness
which
were
apt
to
last
him
all
day
and
this
promised
to
prove
one
of
his
worst
it
was
a
holiday
and
in
the
afternoon
his
cousins
jane
and
william
were
to
come
and
see
him
and
annie
and
the
pears
were
to
be
gathered
and
the
children
were
to
have
a
treat
harry
in
his
impatience
thought
the
morning
would
never
be
over
he
played
such
pranks
buffeting
frisk
cutting
the
curls
off
of
doll
and
finally
breaking
his
grandmother
spectacles
that
before
his
visitors
arrived
indeed
almost
immediately
after
dinner
he
contrived
to
be
sent
to
bed
in
disgrace
poor
harry
there
he
lay
rolling
and
kicking
while
jane
and
william
and
annie
were
busy
about
the
fine
mellow
windsor
pears
william
was
up
in
the
tree
gathering
and
shaking
annie
and
jane
catching
them
in
their
aprons
and
picking
them
up
from
the
ground
now
piling
them
in
baskets
and
now
eating
the
nicest
and
ripest
while
frisk
was
barking
gayly
among
them
as
if
he
were
catching
windsor
pears
too
poor
harry
he
could
hear
all
this
glee
and
merriment
through
the
open
window
as
he
lay
in
bed
the
storm
of
passion
having
subsided
there
he
lay
weeping
and
disconsolate
a
grievous
sob
bursting
forth
every
now
and
then
as
he
heard
the
loud
peals
of
childish
laughter
and
as
he
thought
how
he
should
have
laughed
and
how
happy
he
should
have
been
had
he
not
forfeited
all
this
pleasure
by
his
own
bad
conduct
he
wondered
if
annie
would
not
be
so
as
to
bring
him
a
pear
all
on
a
sudden
he
heard
a
little
foot
on
the
stair
pitapat
and
he
thought
she
was
coming
pitapat
came
the
foot
nearer
and
nearer
and
at
last
a
small
head
peeped
half
afraid
through
the
door
but
it
was
not
annie
head
it
was
frisk
poor
frisk
whom
harry
had
been
teasing
and
tormenting
all
the
morning
and
who
came
into
the
room
wagging
his
tail
with
a
great
pear
in
his
mouth
and
jumping
upon
the
bed
he
laid
it
in
the
little
boy
hand
is
not
frisk
a
fine
grateful
fellow
and
does
he
not
deserve
a
share
of
harry
breakfast
whether
he
begs
for
it
or
not
and
little
harry
will
remember
from
the
events
of
this
day
that
kindness
even
though
shown
to
a
dog
will
always
be
rewarded
and
that
ill
nature
and
bad
temper
are
connected
with
nothing
but
pain

disgrace

xxix
the
eagle
the
eagle
seems
to
enjoy
a
kind
of
supremacy
over
the
rest
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
air
such
is
the
loftiness
of
his
flight
that
he
often
soars
in
the
sky
beyond
the
reach
of
the
naked
eye
and
such
is
his
strength
that
he
has
been
known
to
carry
away
children
in
his
talons
but
many
of
the
noble
qualities
imputed
to
him
are
rather
fanciful
than
true
he
has
been
described
as
showing
a
lofty
independence
which
makes
him
disdain
to
feed
on
anything
that
is
not
slain
by
his
own
strength
but
alexander
wilson
the
great
naturalist
says
that
he
has
seen
an
eagle
feasting
on
the
carcass
of
a
horse
the
eagle
lives
to
a
great
age
one
at
vienna
is
stated
to
have
died
after
a
confinement
of
one
hundred
and
four
years
there
are
several
species
of
the
eagle
the
golden
eagle
which
is
one
of
the
largest
is
nearly
four
feet
from
the
point
of
the
beak
to
the
end
of
the
tail
he
is
found
in
most
parts
of
europe
and
is
also
met
with
in
america
high
rocks
and
ruined
and
lonely
towers
are
the
places
which
he
chooses
for
his
abode
his
nest
is
composed
of
sticks
and
rushes
the
tail
feathers
are
highly
valued
as
ornaments
by
the
american
indians
the
most
interesting
species
is
the
bald
eagle
as
this
is
an
american
bird
and
the
adopted
emblem
of
our
country
he
lives
chiefly
upon
fish
and
is
found
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
sea
and
along
the
shores
and
cliffs
of
our
large
lakes
and
rivers
according
to
the
description
given
by
wilson
he
depends
in
procuring
his
food
chiefly
upon
the
labors
of
others
he
watches
the
fish
hawk
as
he
dives
into
the
sea
for
his
prey
and
darting
down
upon
him
as
he
rises
forces
him
to
relinquish
his
victim
and
then
seizes
it
before
it
again
reaches
the
water
one
of
the
most
notable
species
is
the
harpy
eagle
this
is
said
to
be
bold
and
strong
and
to
attack
beasts
and
even
man
himself
he
is
fierce
quarrelsome
and
sullen
living
alone
in
the
deepest
forests
he
is
found
chiefly
in
south
america

the
old
eagle
tree
in
a
distant
field
stood
a
large
tulip
tree
apparently
of
a
growth
and
one
of
the
most
gigantic
it
looked
like
the
father
of
the
surrounding
forest
a
single
tree
of
huge
dimensions
standing
all
alone
is
a
sublime
object
on
the
top
of
this
tree
an
old
eagle
commonly
called
the
fishing
eagle
had
built
her
nest
every
year
for
many
years
and
undisturbed
had
raised
her
young
a
remarkable
place
to
choose
as
she
procured
her
food
from
the
ocean
and
this
tree
stood
full
ten
miles
from
the
seashore
it
had
long
been
known
as
the
old
eagle
tree
on
a
warm
sunny
day
the
workmen
were
hoeing
corn
in
an
adjoining
field
at
a
certain
hour
of
the
day
the
old
eagle
was
known
to
set
off
for
the
seaside
to
gather
food
for
her
young
as
she
this
day
returned
with
a
large
fish
in
her
claws
the
workmen
surrounded
the
tree
and
by
yelling
and
hooting
and
throwing
stones
so
scared
the
poor
bird
that
she
dropped
her
fish
and
they
carried
it
off
in
triumph
the
men
soon
dispersed
but
joseph
sat
down
under
a
hush
near
by
to
watch
and
to
bestow
unavailing
pity
the
bird
soon
returned
to
her
nest
without
food
the
eaglets
at
once
set
up
a
cry
for
food
so
shrill
so
clear
and
so
clamorous
that
the
boy
was
greatly
moved
the
parent
bird
seemed
to
try
to
soothe
them
but
their
appetites
were
too
keen
and
it
was
all
in
vain
she
then
perched
herself
on
a
limb
near
them
and
looked
down
into
the
nest
in
a
manner
that
seemed
to
say
i
know
not
what
to
do
next
her
indecision
was
but
momentary
again
she
poised
herself
uttered
one
or
two
sharp
notes
as
if
telling
them
to
a
lie
still
balanced
her
body
spread
her
wings
and
was
away
again
for
the
sea
joseph
was
determined
to
see
the
result
his
eye
followed
her
till
she
grew
small
smaller
a
mere
speck
in
the
sky
and
then
disappeared
what
boy
has
not
thus
watched
the
flight
of
the
bird
of
his
country
she
was
gone
nearly
two
hours
about
double
her
usual
time
for
a
voyage
when
she
again
returned
on
a
slow
weary
wing
flying
uncommonly
low
in
order
to
have
a
heavier
atmosphere
to
sustain
her
with
another
fish
in
her
talons
on
nearing
the
field
she
made
a
circuit
round
it
to
see
if
her
enemies
were
again
there
finding
the
coast
clear
she
once
more
reached
the
tree
drooping
faint
and
weary
and
evidently
nearly
exhausted
again
the
eaglets
set
up
their
cry
which
was
soon
hushed
by
the
distribution
of
a
dinner
such
as
save
the
cooking
a
king
might
admire
glorious
bird
cried
the
boy
what
a
spirit
other
birds
can
fly
more
swiftly
others
can
sing
more
sweetly
others
scream
more
loudly
but
what
other
bird
when
persecuted
and
robbed
when
weary
when
discouraged
when
so
far
from
the
sea
would
do
this
glorious
bird
i
will
learn
a
lesson
from
thee
i
will
never
forget
hereafter
that
when
the
spirit
is
determined
it
can
do
almost
anything
others
would
have
drooped
and
hung
the
head
and
mourned
over
the
cruelty
of
man
and
sighed
over
the
wants
of
the
nestlings

and
i
am

afraid
she
will
fall
and
break
your
neck
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
about

is
certainly
and

score
of
them
and
i
am
sure
he
will
lend
me
one
that
will
fit
her
you
know
friend
derby
that
no
one
is
more
willing
to
oblige
his
neighbors
than
i
am
i
do
assure
you
the
beast
should
be
at
your
service
with
all
my
heart
but
she
has
not
been
curried
i
believe
for
three
weeks
past
her
foretop
and
mane
want
combing
and
cutting
very
much
if
anyone
should
see
her
in
her
present
plight
it
would
ruin
the
sale
of
her
oh
a
horse
is
soon
curried
and
my
son
sam
shall
attend
to
it
at
once
yes
very
likely
but
i
this
moment
recollect
the
creature
has
no
shoes
on
well
is
there
not
a
blacksmith
hard
by
what
that
tinker
dobson
i
would
not
trust
such
a
bungler
to
shoe
a
goat
no
no
none
but
uncle
tom
thumper
shall
shoe
my
mare
as
good
luck
will
have
it
then
i
shall
pass
right
by
his
door
calling
to
his
son
tim
tim
here
neighbor
derby
who
wants
the
loan
of
the
gray
mare
to
ride
to
town
you
know
the
skin
was
rubbed
off
her
back
last
week
a
hand
breadth
or
more
gives
tim
a
wink
however
i
believe
she
is
well
enough
by
this
time
you
know
tim
how
ready
i
am
to
oblige
my
neighbors
indeed
we
ought
to
do
all
the
good
we
can
in
this
world
we
must
certainly
let
neighbor
derby
have
her
if
she
will
possibly
answer
his
purpose
yes
yes
i
see
plainly
by
countenance
neighbor
derby
that
he
disposed
to
oblige
you
i
would
not
have
refused
you
the
mare
for
the
worth
of
her
if
i
had
i
should
have
expected
you
to
refuse
me
in
turn
none
of
my
neighbors
can
accuse
me
of
being
backward
in
doing
them
a
kindness
whenever
it
is
possible
come
tim
what
do
you
say
tim
what
do
i
say
father
why
sir
i
say
that
i
am
no
less
ready
than
you
are
to
do
a
neighborly
kindness
but
the
mare
is
by
no
means
capable
of
performing
the
journey
about
a
hand
breadth
did
you
say
why
sir
the
skin
is
torn
from
the
poor
creature
back
the
bigness
of
your
hat
and
besides
i
have
promised
her
so
soon
as
she
is
able
to
travel
to
ned
saunders
to
carry
a
load
of
apples
to
market
do
you
hear
that
neighbor
i
am
very
sorry
matters
are
thus
i
would
not
have
disobliged
you
for
the
price
of
two
such
mares
believe
me
neighbor
derby
i
am
really
sorry
for
your
sake
that
matters
turn
out
thus
and
i
as
much
for
yours
neighbor
scrapewell
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
received
a
letter
this
morning
from
griffin
who
tells
me
if
i
will
be
in
town
he
will
give
me
the
refusal
of
all
that
lot
of
timber
which
he
is
about
cutting
down
on
the
side
of
the
hill
and
i
had
intended
you
should
have
shared
half
of
it
which
would
have
been
not
less
than
fitly
dollars
in
your
pocket
but
as
your
fifty
dollars
did
you
say
ay
truly
did
i
but
as
your
mare
is
out
of
order
i
go
and
see
if
i
can
get
old
roan
the
blacksmith
horse
old
roan
my
mare
is
at
your
service
neighbor
here
tim
tell
ned
saunders
he
ca
have
the
mare
neighbor
derby
wants
her
and
i
refuse
so
good
a
friend
anything
he
asks
for
but
what
are
you
to
do
for
meal
my
wife
can
do
without
it
for
a
week
if
you
want
the
mare
so
long
but
then
your
saddle
is
all
in
pieces
i
meant
the
old
one
i
have
bought
a
new
one
since
and
you
shall
have
the
first
use
of
it
and
shall
i
call
at
thumper
and
get
the
mare
shod
no
no
i
had
forgotten
to
tell
you
that
i
let
neighbor
dobson
shoe
her
last
week
by
way
of
trial
and
to
do
him
justice
he
shoes
extremely
well
but
if
the
poor
creature
has
lost
so
much
skin
from
off
her
back
poh
poh
that
is
just
one
of
tim
large
stories
i
do
assure
you
it
was
not
at
first
bigger
than
my
thumb
nail
and
i
am
certain
it
has
not
grown
any
since
at
least
however
let
her
have
something
she
will
eat
since
she
refuses
hay
she
did
indeed
refuse
hay
this
morning
but
the
only
reason
was
that
she
was
crammed
full
of
oats
you
have
nothing
to
fear
neighbor
the
mare
is
in
perfect
trim
and
she
will
skim
you
over
the
ground
like
a
bird
i
wish
you
a
good
journey
and
a
profitable
job
l
very
much
full
of
whims
cleaned
hair
on
the
forepart
of
the
head
a
clumsy
workman
inclined
to
slow
unwilling
possessing
ability
accomplishing
choice
of
crammed
stuffed
xxxiii
the
noblest
revenge
i
will
have
revenge
on
him
that
i
will
and
make
him
heartily
repent
it
said
philip
to
himself
with
a
countenance
quite
red
with
anger
his
mind
was
so
engaged
that
he
did
not
see
stephen
who
happened
at
that
instant
to
meet
him
who
is
that
said
stephen
on
whom
you
intend
to
be
revenged
philip
as
if
awakened
from
a
dream
stopped
short
and
looking
at
his
friend
soon
resumed
a
smile
that
was
natural
to
his
countenance
ah
said
he
you
remember
my
bamboo
a
very
pretty
cane
which
was
given
me
by
my
father
do
you
not
look
there
it
is
in
pieces
it
was
farmer
robinson
son
who
reduced
it
to
this
worthless
state
stephen
very
coolly
asked
him
what
had
induced
young
robinson
to
break
it
i
was
walking
peaceably
along
replied
he
and
was
playing
with
my
cane
by
twisting
it
round
my
body
by
accident
one
of
the
ends
slipped
out
of
my
hand
when
i
was
opposite
the
gate
just
by
the
wooden
bridge
where
the
ill
natured
fellow
had
put
down
a
pitcher
of
water
which
he
was
taking
home
from
the
well
it
so
happened
that
my
cane
in
springing
back
upset
the
pitcher
but
did
not
break
it
he
came
up
close
to
me
and
began
to
call
me
names
when
i
assured
him
that
what
i
had
done
had
happened
by
accident
and
that
i
was
sorry
for
it
without
regarding
what
i
said
he
instantly
seized
my
cane
and
twisted
it
as
you
see
but
i
will
make
him
repent
of
it
to
be
sure
said
stephen
he
is
a
very
wicked
boy
and
is
already
very
properly
punished
for
being
such
since
nobody
likes
him
or
will
have
anything
to
do
with
him
he
can
scarcely
find
a
companion
to
play
with
him
and
is
often
at
a
loss
for
amusement
as
he
deserves
to
be
this
properly
considered
i
think
will
appear
sufficient
revenge
for
you
all
this
is
true
replied
philip
but
he
has
broken
my
cane
it
was
a
present
from
my
father
and
a
very
pretty
cane
it
was
i
offered
to
fill
his
pitcher
for
him
again
as
i
knocked
it
down
by
accident
i
will
be
revenged
now
philip
said
stephen
i
think
you
will
act
better
in
not
minding
him
as
your
contempt
will
be
the
best
punishment
you
can
inflict
upon
him
be
assured
he
will
always
be
able
to
do
more
mischief
to
you
than
you
choose
to
do
to
him
and
now
i
think
of
it
i
will
tell
you
what
happened
to
him
not
long
since
very
unluckily
for
him
he
chanced
to
see
a
bee
hovering
about
a
flower
which
he
caught
and
was
going
to
pull
off
its
wings
out
of
sport
when
the
animal
stung
him
and
flew
away
in
safety
to
the
hive
the
pain
put
him
into
a
furious
passion
and
like
you
he
vowed
revenge
he
accordingly
procured
a
stick
and
thrust
it
into
the
beehive
in
an
instant
the
whole
swarm
flew
out
and
alighting
upon
him
stung
him
in
a
hundred
different
places
he
uttered
the
most
piercing
cries
and
rolled
upon
the
ground
in
the
excess
of
his
agony
his
father
immediately
ran
to
him
but
could
not
put
the
bees
to
flight
until
they
had
stung
him
so
severely
that
he
was
confined
several
days
to
his
bed
thus
you
see
he
was
not
very
successful
in
his
pursuit
of
revenge
i
would
advise
you
therefore
to
pass
over
his
insult
he
is
a
wicked
boy
and
much
stronger
than
you
so
that
your
ability
to
obtain
this
revenge
may
be
doubtful
i
must
own
replied
philip
that
your
advice
seems
very
good
so
come
along
with
me
and
i
will
tell
my
father
the
whole
matter
and
i
think
he
will
not
be
angry
with
me
they
went
and
philip
told
his
father
what
had
happened
he
thanked
stephen
for
the
good
advice
he
had
given
his
son
and
promised
philip
to
give
him
another
cane
exactly
like
the
first
a
few
days
afterward
philip
saw
this
boy
fall
as
he
was
carrying
home
a
heavy
log
of
wood
which
he
could
not
lift
up
again
philip
ran
to
him
and
helped
him
to
replace
it
on
his
shoulder
young
robinson
was
quite
ashamed
at
the
thought
of
this
unmerited
kindness
and
heartily
repented
of
his
behavior
philip
went
home
quite
satisfied
this
said
he
is
the
noblest
vengeance
i
could
take
in
returning
good
for
evil
it
is
impossible
i
should
repent
of
it
l
return
for
an
injury
to
feel
sorry
for
the
face
took
again
caused
declared
positively
noticing
thought
of
disdain
scorn
to
impose
to
put
on
hanging
over
or
about
very
great
pain
power
what
is
revenge
is
it
right
to
take
revenge
on
those
who
injure
us
how
should
we
treat
such
persons
xxxiv

work
is
done
the

star
to

and

to

sweet

pleasant
the

low

the
gleaming
of
the
west
and
the

whereon
we
lie
when
the
burden
and
the
heat
of
the
laborer
task
is
and
kindly
voices
greet
the
tired
one
at
the
door
yes
tuneful
is
the
sound
that
dwells
in
whispering
boughs
welcome
the
freshness
round
and
the
gale
that
fans
our
brows
but
rest
more
sweet
and
still
than
ever
the
nightfall

shall
fill
in

grave
there
shall
no
tempests
blow
nor
scorching

heat
there
shall
be
no

wandering
feet
so
we
lift
our

from

trod
to
the
quiet
of

to
the

xxxv
how
margery
wondered
by
lucy
larcom
one
bright
morning
late
in
march
little
margery
put
on
her
hood
and
her
highland
plaid
shawl
and
went
trudging
across
the
beach
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
trusted
out
alone
for
margery
was
a
little
girl
nothing
about
her
was
large
except
her
round
gray
eyes
which
had
yet
scarcely
opened
upon
half
a
dozen
springs
and
summers
there
was
a
pale
mist
on
the
sea
and
sky
and
up
around
the
sun
were
white
clouds
edged
with
the
hues
of
pinks
and
violets
the
sunshine
and
the
mild
air
made
margery
very
heart
feel
warm
and
she
let
the
soft
wind
blow
aside
her
highland
shawl
as
she
looked
across
the
waters
at
the
sun
and
wondered
for
somehow
the
sun
had
never
looked
before
as
it
did
it
seemed
like
a
great
golden
flower
bursting
out
of
its
calyx
a
flower
without
a
stem
or
was
there
a
strong
stem
away
behind
it
in
the
sky
that
reached
down
below
the
sea
to
a
root
nobody
could
guess
where
margery
did
not
stop
to
puzzle
herself
about
the
answer
to
her
question
for
now
the
tide
was
coming
in
and
the
waves
little
at
first
but
growing
larger
every
moment
were
crowding
up
along
the
sand
and
pebbles
laughing
winking
and
whispering
as
they
tumbled
over
each
other
like
thousands
of
children
hurrying
home
from
somewhere
each
with
its
own
precious
little
secret
to
tell
where
did
the
waves
come
from
who
was
down
there
under
the
blue
wall
of
the
horizon
with
the
hoarse
hollow
voice
urging
and
pushing
them
across
the
beach
at
her
feet
and
what
secret
was
it
they
were
lisping
to
each
other
with
their
pleasant
voices
oh
what
was
there
beneath
the
sea
and
beyond
the
sea
so
deep
so
broad
and
so
dim
too
away
off
where
the
white
ships
that
looked
smaller
than
sea
birds
were
gliding
out
and
in
but
while
margery
stood
still
for
a
moment
on
a
dry
rock
and
wondered
there
came
a
low
rippling
warble
to
her
ear
from
a
cedar
tree
on
the
cliff
above
her
it
had
been
a
long
winter
and
margery
had
forgotten
that
there
were
birds
and
that
birds
could
sing
so
she
wondered
again
what
the
music
was
and
when
she
saw
the
bird
perched
on
a
bough
she
wondered
yet
more
it
was
only
a
bluebird
but
then
it
was
the
first
bluebird
margery
had
ever
seen
he
fluttered
among
the
prickly
twigs
and
looked
as
if
he
had
grown
out
of
them
as
the
cedar
berries
had
which
were
dusty
blue
the
color
of
his
coat
but
how
did
the
music
get
in
his
throat
and
after
it
was
in
his
throat
how
could
it
untangle
itself
and
wind
itself
off
so
evenly
and
where
had
the
bluebird
flown
from
across
the
snow
banks
down
to
the
shore
of
the
blue
sea
the
waves
sang
a
welcome
to
him
and
he
sang
a
welcome
to
the
waves
they
seemed
to
know
each
other
well
and
the
ripple
and
the
warble
sounded
so
much
alike
the
bird
and
the
wave
must
have
both
learned
their
music
of
the
same
teacher
and
margery
kept
on
wondering
as
she
stepped
between
the
song
of
the
bluebird
and
the
echo
of
the
sea
and
climbed
a
sloping
bank
just
turning
faintly
green
in
the
spring
sunshine
the
grass
was
surely
beginning
to
grow
there
were
fresh
juicy
shoots
running
up
among
the
withered
blades
of
last
year
as
if
in
hopes
of
bringing
them
back
to
life
and
closer
down
she
saw
the
sharp
points
of
new
spears
peeping
from
their
sheaths
and
scattered
here
and
there
were
small
dark
green
leaves
folded
around
buds
shut
up
so
tightly
that
only
those
who
had
watched
them
many
seasons
could
tell
what
flowers
were
to
be
let
out
of
their
safe
prisons
by
and
by
so
no
one
could
blame
margery
for
not
knowing
that
they
were
only
common
things
nor
for
stooping
over
the
tiny
buds
and
wondering
what
made
the
grass
come
up
so
green
out
of
the
black
earth
and
how
did
the
buds
know
when
it
was
time
to
take
off
their
little
green
hoods
and
see
what
there
was
in
the
world
around
them
and
how
came
they
to
be
buds
at
all
did
they
bloom
in
another
world
before
they
sprung
up
here
and
did
they
know
themselves
what
kind
of
flowers
they
should
blossom
into
had
flowers
souls
like
little
girls
that
would
live
in
another
world
when
their
forms
had
faded
away
in
this
margery
thought
she
would
like
to
sit
down
on
the
bank
and
wait
beside
the
buds
until
they
opened
perhaps
they
would
tell
her
their
secret
if
the
very
first
thing
they
saw
was
her
eyes
watching
them
one
bud
was
beginning
to
unfold
it
was
streaked
with
yellow
in
little
stripes
that
she
could
imagine
became
wider
every
minute
but
she
would
not
touch
it
for
it
seemed
almost
as
much
alive
as
herself
she
only
wondered
and
wondered
margery
heard
her
mother
calling
her
and
she
trudged
home
across
the
shells
and
pebbles
with
a
pleasant
smile
dimpling
her
cheeks
for
she
felt
very
much
at
home
in
this
large
wonderful
world
and
was
happy
to
be
alive
although
she
neither
could
have
told
nor
cared
to
know
the
reason
why
but
when
her
mother
unpinned
the
little
girl
highland
shawl
and
took
off
her
hood
she
said
o
mother
do
let
me
live
on
the
doorstep
i
do
like
houses
to
stay
in
what
makes
everything
so
pretty
and
so
glad
do
you
like
to
wonder
margery
mother
was
a
good
woman
but
then
there
was
all
the
housework
to
do
and
if
she
had
thoughts
she
did
not
often
let
them
wander
outside
of
the
kitchen
door
and
just
now
she
was
baking
some
gingerbread
which
was
in
danger
of
getting
burned
in
the
oven
so
she
pinned
the
shawl
around
the
child
neck
again
and
left
her
on
the
doorstep
saying
to
herself
as
she
returned
to
her
work
queer
child
i
wonder
what
kind
of
a
woman
she
will
be
but
margery
sat
on
the
doorstep
and
wondered
as
the
sea
sounded
louder
and
the
sunshine
grew
warmer
around
her
it
was
all
so
strange
and
grand
and
beautiful
her
heart
danced
with
joy
to
the
music
that
went
echoing
through
the
wide
world
from
the
roots
of
the
sprouting
grass
to
the
great
golden
blossom
of
the
sun
and
when
the
round
gray
eyes
closed
that
night
at
the
first
peep
of
the
stars
the
angels
looked
down
and
wondered
over
margery
for
the
wisdom
of
the
wisest
being
god
has
made
ends
in
wonder
and
there
is
nothing
on
earth
so
wonderful
as
the
budding
soul
of
a
little
child
walking
sturdily
hues
colors
the
outer
covering
of
a
flower
the
line
where
the
sky
and
earth
seem
to
meet
a
trill
of
the
voice
spears
shoots
of
grass
sheaths
coverings
name
the
things
about
which
margery
wondered
what
did
she
wonder
about
each
what
is
still
more
wonderful
than
all
that
at
which
margery
wondered

great
wide

with
the
wonderful

round
you
curled
and
the
wonderful
grass
upon
your
breast

you
are
beautifully
drest
the
wonderful
air
is
over
me
and
the
wonderful
wind
is
shaking
the
tree
it
walks
on
the
water
and
whirls
the
mills
and
talks
to
itself
on
the
tops
of
the
hills
you
friendly

how
far
do
you
go
with

wheat

am

small
i
tremble
to

of
you

all
and
yet
when
i
said
my
prayers
a
whisper
inside
me
seemed
to
say
you
are
more

you
are

xxxvii
susie
composition
susie
smith
came
home
from
school
one
day
and
had
no
sooner
entered
the
sitting
room
than
she
burst
into
tears
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
child
said
her
mother
drawing
her
daughter
to
her
side
and
smiling
o
mother
matter
enough
sobbed
susie
all
our
class
must
bring
in
compositions
morning
and
i
never
never
can
write
one
we
must
write
twelve
lines
at
least
and
i
have
written
only
a
few
words
after
trying
nearly
all
the
afternoon
see
what
work
i
have
made
of
it
smith
took
the
rumpled
paper
which
susie
held
in
her
hand
and
glanced
at
what
she
had
written
in
a
careful
hand
she
had
tried
to
write
upon
three
themes
time
temperance
and
industry
time
is
short
we
should
all
improve
our
time
temperance
is
a
very
useful
thing
we
should
all
be
industrious
if
we
wish
to
do
anything
in
the
world
these
sentences
were
all
she
had
written
now
said
susie
i
ca
think
of
another
word
to
say
upon
any
of
these
subjects
and
i
know
i
shall
have
to
go
to
school
without
a
composition
for
i
wo
be
so
mean
as
to
copy
one
from
a
book
or
to
ask
you
or
papa
to
write
one
for
me
that
is
right
my
dear
said
her
mother
you
will
be
far
happier
with
a
poor
composition
if
it
is
all
your
own
than
with
a
fine
one
written
by
somebody
else
but
cheer
up
you
have
not
begun
right
you
have
been
trying
to
write
upon
subjects
that
you
know
nothing
about
run
into
the
garden
and
play
i
will
call
you
in
half
an
hour
but
my
composition
began
susie
do
think
about
your
composition
while
you
are
gone
said
smith
but
have
as
pleasant
a
time
as
you
can
it
seemed
but
a
few
minutes
to
susie
before
she
heard
her
voice
calling
her
she
went
into
the
house
at
once
her
hands
full
of
sweet
flowers
and
her
cheeks
rosy
with
exercise
now
susie
said
her
mother
i
want
you
to
sit
by
the
window
with
this
nice
sheet
of
paper
and
a
pencil
and
write
something
about
what
you
can
see
but
my
composition
mother
said
susie
when
shall
i
begin
that
never
mind
your
composition
my
dear
do
this
to
please
me
and
we
will
talk
about
that
by
and
by
susie
thought
her
mother
request
was
a
strange
one
but
she
knew
that
she
always
had
a
good
reason
for
everything
she
did
so
she
took
the
paper
and
pencil
and
sat
by
the
window
do
not
talk
to
me
at
all
said
her
mother
look
out
of
the
window
and
then
write
down
your
thoughts
about
everything
you
see
susie
could
not
help
laughing
it
seemed
such
a
funny
thing
to
be
doing
as
she
looked
out
she
first
saw
the
western
sky
and
some
bright
sunset
clouds
o
mother
she
exclaimed
what
a
splendid
sunset
talk
said
her
mother
but
write
i
write
about
the
sunset
then
said
she
and
the
pencil
began
to
move
rapidly
across
the
paper
in
a
few
moments
she
said
mother
shall
i
read
you
what
i
have
written
no
not
now
answered
her
mother
i
am
going
into
the
dining
room
you
may
sit
and
write
until
i
return
as
susie
went
on
writing
she
became
very
much
interested
in
her
occupation
and
for
a
time
forgot
all
about
the
dreaded
composition
she
wrote
about
the
sunset
clouds
the
appearance
of
the
distant
hills
the
trees
the
river
the
garden
with
its
gay
flowers
and
the
birds
flying
past
the
window
just
as
she
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
page
her
mother
came
in
well
susie
said
she
with
a
smile
how
does
that
composition
come
on
composition
exclaimed
susie
you
told
me
not
to
think
about
my
composition
and
i
have
not
thought
of
it
once
i
have
had
such
a
nice
time
writing
about
what
i
could
see
from
the
window
smith
took
the
paper
and
read
aloud
what
susie
had
written
i
am
sitting
on
a
low
seat
at
the
bay
window
one
half
of
which
is
open
so
that
i
can
smell
the
sweet
flowers
in
the
garden
the
sky
is
all
bright
with
sunset
i
can
see
purple
and
pink
and
golden
i
do
not
believe
that
anyone
on
earth
has
a
paint
box
with
such
lovely
colors
in
it
i
can
see
one
cloud
far
above
the
rest
that
looks
like
a
ship
sailing
in
the
blue
sea
i
should
like
to
sail
on
a
cloud
if
it
would
not
make
me
dizzy
now
while
i
have
been
writing
the
clouds
have
changed
in
color
and
form
but
they
are
just
as
beautiful
as
they
were
before
the
green
hills
are
tipped
with
light
and
look
as
if
they
were
wearing
golden
crowns
i
can
see
a
river
a
great
way
off
and
it
looks
quite
still
although
i
know
it
is
running
as
fast
as
it
can
to
get
to
the
ocean
the
birds
are
flying
past
the
window
to
go
home
and
take
care
of
their
little
ones
i
am
glad
the
birds
are
not
afraid
to
live
in
our
garden
and
to
build
nests
in
our
trees
our
garden
is
full
of
flowers
pinks
lilies
and
roses
mother
calls
this
the
month
of
roses
my
birthday
will
come
in
a
week
and
we
can
have
all
the
flowers
we
wish
for
wreaths
and
bouquets
there
susie
said
smith
that
is
a
very
nice
composition
indeed
a
composition
exclaimed
susie
is
that
a
composition
yes
my
dear
and
a
very
good
one
too
replied
her
mother
when
it
even
a
subject
we
can
find
one
for
it
and
i
do
not
doubt
it
will
please
your
teacher
as
it
does
me
you
see
my
dear
continued
her
mother
that
it
is
easy
enough
to
write
if
you
have
anything
interesting
to
write
about
the
next
morning
susie
copied
her
composition
very
neatly
and
started
to
school
with
a
happy
heart
saying
as
she
gave
her
mother
a
kiss
just
think
how
funny
it
is
dear
mother
that
i
should
have
written
so
long
a
composition
without
knowing
it
that
which
is
thought
out
and
arranged
a
written
or
literary
work
wrinkled
creased
themes
subjects
or
topics
on
which
a
person
writes
that
which
is
asked
that
which
employs
the
time
pro
bunches
of
flowers
what
is
a
composition
why
was
susie
so
troubled
why
could
she
not
write
about
time
temperance
or
industry
what
did
her
mother
have
her
do
what
did
susie
write
was
it
a
composition
did
she
know
at
the
time
that
it
was
what
fault
did
she
find
with
it
can
you
give
her
composition
a
proper
subject
xxxviii
the
summer
shower
the
author
thomas
buchanan
read
was
born
in
chester
march
his
life
was
devoted
to
the
fine
arts
and
he
attained
a
high
reputation
both
as
artist
and
poet
he
died
in
new
york
may
before
the
stout
harvesters
falleth
the
grain
as
when
the
strong
stormwind
is
reaping
the
plain
and
loiters
the
boy
in
the
briery
lane
but
yonder
aslant
comes
the
silvery
rain
like
a
long
line
of
spears
brightly
burnished
and
tall
adown
the
white
highway
like
cavalry
fleet
it
dashes
the
dust
with
its
numberless
feet
like
a
murmurless
school
in
their
leafy
retreat
the
wild
birds
sit
listening
the
drops
round
them
beat
and
the
boy
crouches
close
to
the
blackberry
wall
the
swallows
alone
take
the
storm
on
the
wing
and
taunting
the
laborers
sing
like
pebbles
the
rain
breaks
the
face
of
the
spring
while
a
bubble
darts
up
from
each
widening
ring
and
the
boy
in
dismay
hears
the
loud
shower
fall
but
soon
are
the
harvesters
tossing
their
sheaves
the
robin
darts
out
from
his
bower
of
leaves
the
wren
peereth
forth
from
the
eaves
and
the
urchin
now
gladly
perceives
that
the
beautiful
bow
bendeth
over
them
all
l
toward
one
side
a
public
road
a
place
of
refuge
or
safety
stoops
low
deriding
mocking
a
child
xxxix
consequences
of
idleness
many
young
persons
seem
to
think
it
of
not
much
consequence
if
they
do
not
improve
their
time
well
in
youth
vainly
expecting
that
they
can
make
it
up
by
diligence
when
they
are
older
they
also
think
it
is
disgraceful
for
men
and
women
to
be
idle
but
that
there
can
be
no
harm
for
persons
who
are
young
to
spend
their
time
in
any
manner
they
please
george
jones
thought
so
when
he
was
twelve
years
old
he
went
to
an
academy
to
prepare
to
enter
college
his
father
was
at
great
expense
in
obtaining
books
for
him
clothing
him
and
paying
his
tuition
but
george
was
idle
the
preceptor
of
the
academy
would
often
tell
him
that
if
he
did
not
study
diligently
when
young
he
would
never
succeed
well
but
george
thought
of
nothing
but
present
pleasure
he
would
often
go
to
school
without
having
made
any
preparation
for
his
morning
lesson
and
when
called
to
recite
with
his
class
he
would
stammer
and
make
such
blunders
that
the
rest
of
the
class
could
not
help
laughing
at
him
he
was
one
of
the
poorest
scholars
in
the
school
because
he
was
one
of
the
most
idle
when
recess
came
and
all
the
boys
ran
out
of
the
academy
upon
the
playground
idle
george
would
come
moping
along
instead
of
studying
diligently
while
in
school
he
was
indolent
and
half
asleep
when
the
proper
time
for
play
came
he
had
no
relish
for
it
i
recollect
very
well
that
when
tossing
up
for
a
game
of
ball
we
used
to
choose
everybody
on
the
playground
before
we
chose
george
and
if
there
were
enough
without
him
we
used
to
leave
him
out
thus
he
was
unhappy
in
school
and
out
of
school
there
is
nothing
which
makes
a
person
enjoy
play
so
well
as
to
study
hard
when
recess
was
over
and
the
rest
of
the
boys
returned
fresh
and
vigorous
to
their
studies
george
might
be
seen
lagging
and
moping
along
to
his
seat
sometimes
he
would
be
asleep
in
school
sometimes
he
would
pass
his
time
in
catching
flies
and
penning
them
up
in
little
holes
which
he
cut
in
his
seat
and
sometimes
when
the
preceptor
back
was
turned
he
would
throw
a
paper
ball
across
the
room
when
the
class
was
called
up
to
recite
george
would
come
drowsily
along
looking
as
mean
and
ashamed
as
though
he
were
going
to
be
whipped
the
rest
of
the
class
stepped
up
to
the
recitation
with
alacrity
and
appeared
happy
and
contented
when
it
came
george
turn
to
recite
he
would
be
so
long
in
doing
it
and
make
such
blunders
that
all
most
heartily
wished
him
out
of
the
class
at
last
george
went
with
his
class
to
enter
college
though
he
passed
a
very
poor
examination
he
was
admitted
with
the
rest
for
those
who
examined
him
thought
it
was
possible
that
the
reason
why
he
did
not
answer
questions
better
was
because
he
was
frightened
now
came
hard
times
for
poor
george
in
college
there
is
not
much
mercy
shown
to
bad
scholars
and
george
had
neglected
his
studies
so
long
that
he
could
not
now
keep
up
with
his
class
let
him
try
ever
so
hard
he
could
without
much
difficulty
get
along
in
the
academy
where
there
were
only
two
or
three
boys
of
his
own
class
to
laugh
at
him
but
now
he
had
to
go
into
a
large
recitation
room
filled
with
students
from
all
parts
of
the
country
in
the
presence
of
all
these
he
must
rise
and
recite
to
a
professor
poor
fellow
he
paid
dearly
for
his
idleness
you
would
have
pitied
him
if
you
could
have
seen
him
trembling
in
his
scat
every
moment
expecting
to
be
called
upon
to
recite
and
when
he
was
called
upon
he
would
stand
up
and
take
what
the
class
called
a
dead
set
that
is
he
could
not
recite
at
all
sometimes
he
would
make
such
ludicrous
blunders
that
the
whole
class
would
burst
into
a
laugh
such
are
the
applauses
an
idler
gets
he
was
wretched
of
course
he
had
been
idle
so
long
that
he
hardly
knew
how
to
apply
his
mind
to
study
all
the
good
scholars
avoided
him
they
were
ashamed
to
be
seen
in
his
company
he
became
discouraged
and
gradually
grew
dissipated
the
officers
of
the
college
were
soon
compelled
to
suspend
him
he
returned
in
a
few
months
but
did
no
better
and
his
father
was
then
advised
to
take
him
from
college
he
left
college
despised
by
everyone
a
few
months
ago
i
met
him
a
poor
wanderer
without
money
and
without
friends
such
are
the
wages
of
idleness
i
hope
every
reader
will
from
this
history
take
warning
and
stamp
improvement
on
the
wings
of
time
importance
influence
a
school
of
high
order
a
seminary
of
learning
of
the
highest
order
a
teacher
a
making
ready
full
of
activity

i
gave
you
in
the
last
lesson
the
history
of
george
jones
an
idle
boy
and
showed
you
the
consequences
of
his
idleness
i
shall
now
give
you
the
history
of
charles
bullard
a
classmate
of
george
charles
was
about
the
same
age
as
george
and
did
not
possess
superior
talents
indeed
i
doubt
whether
he
was
equal
to
him
in
natural
powers
of
mind
but
charles
was
a
hard
student
when
quite
young
he
was
always
careful
and
diligent
in
school
sometimes
when
there
was
a
very
hard
lesson
instead
of
going
out
to
play
during
recess
he
would
stay
in
to
study
he
had
resolved
that
his
first
object
should
be
to
get
his
lessons
well
and
then
he
could
play
with
a
good
conscience
he
loved
play
as
well
as
anybody
and
was
one
of
the
best
players
on
the
ground
i
hardly
ever
saw
any
boy
catch
a
ball
better
than
he
could
when
playing
any
game
everyone
was
glad
to
get
charles
on
his
side
i
have
said
that
charles
would
sometimes
stay
in
at
recess
this
however
was
very
seldom
it
was
only
when
the
lessons
were
very
hard
indeed
generally
he
was
among
the
first
on
the
playground
and
he
was
also
among
the
first
to
go
into
school
when
called
hard
study
gave
him
a
relish
for
play
and
play
again
gave
him
a
relish
for
hard
study
so
he
was
happy
both
in
school
and
out
the
preceptor
could
not
help
liking
him
for
he
always
had
his
lessons
well
committed
and
never
gave
him
any
trouble
when
he
went
to
enter
college
the
preceptor
gave
him
a
good
recommendation
he
was
able
to
answer
all
the
questions
which
were
put
to
him
when
he
was
examined
he
had
studied
so
well
when
he
was
in
the
academy
and
was
so
thoroughly
prepared
for
college
that
he
found
it
very
easy
to
keep
up
with
his
class
and
had
much
time
for
reading
interesting
books
but
he
would
always
get
his
lesson
well
before
he
did
anything
else
and
would
review
it
just
before
recitation
when
called
upon
to
recite
he
rose
tranquil
and
happy
and
very
seldom
made
mistakes
the
officers
of
the
college
had
a
high
opinion
of
him
and
he
was
respected
by
all
the
students
there
was
in
the
college
a
society
made
up
of
all
the
best
scholars
charles
was
chosen
a
member
of
that
society
it
was
the
custom
to
choose
some
one
of
the
society
to
deliver
a
public
address
every
year
this
honor
was
conferred
on
charles
and
he
had
studied
so
diligently
and
read
so
much
that
he
delivered
an
address
which
was
very
interesting
to
all
who
heard
it
at
last
he
graduated
as
it
is
called
that
is
he
finished
his
collegiate
course
and
received
his
degree
it
was
known
by
all
that
he
was
a
good
scholar
and
by
all
that
he
was
respected
his
father
and
mother
brothers
and
sisters
came
on
the
commencement
day
to
hear
him
speak
they
all
felt
gratified
and
loved
charles
more
than
ever
many
situations
of
usefulness
and
profit
were
opened
to
him
for
charles
was
now
an
intelligent
man
and
universally
respected
he
is
still
a
useful
and
a
happy
man
he
has
a
cheerful
home
and
is
esteemed
by
all
who
know
him
such
are
the
rewards
of
industry
how
strange
it
is
that
any
person
should
be
willing
to
live
in
idleness
when
it
will
certainly
make
him
unhappy
the
idle
boy
is
almost
invariably
poor
and
miserable
the
industrious
boy
is
happy
and
prosperous
but
perhaps
some
child
who
reads
this
asks
does
god
notice
little
children
in
school
he
certainly
does
and
if
you
are
not
diligent
in
the
improvement
of
your
time
it
is
one
of
the
surest
evidences
that
your
heart
is
not
right
with
god
you
are
placed
in
this

to
improve
your

you
must

you

xlii
coffee
the
coffee
tree
is
a
native
of
eastern
africa
but
it
was
in
arabia
that
it
first
became
known
to
the
people
of
europe
and
until
about
the
year
that
country
afforded
the
entire
supply
then
the
coffee
seeds
found
their
way
to
java
by
means
of
some
traders
and
one
of
the
first
plants
grown
on
that
island
was
sent
as
a
present
to
the
governor
of
the
dutch
east
india
company
who
lived
in
holland
it
was
planted
in
the
botanical
gardens
at
amsterdam
and
in
a
few
years
seeds
taken
from
it
were
sent
to
south
america
where
the
cultivation
of
coffee
has
steadily
increased
extending
to
the
west
indies
until
now
the
offspring
of
this
one
plant
produce
more
coffee
than
is
obtained
from
all
the
other
plants
in
the
world
the
plant
is
an
evergreen
and
is
from
six
to
twelve
feet
high
the
stem
being
from
ten
to
fifteen
inches
in
diameter
the
lower
branches
bend
down
when
the
tree
begins
to
grow
old
and
extend
themselves
into
a
round
form
somewhat
like
an
umbrella
and
the
wood
is
so
pliable
that
the
ends
of
the
largest
branches
may
be
bent
down
to
within
two
or
three
feet
of
the
earth
the
bark
is
whitish
and
somewhat
rough
a
tree
is
never
without
leaves
which
are
at
small
distances
from
one
another
and
on
almost
opposite
sides
of
a
bough
blossoms
and
green
and
ripe
fruit
may
be
seen
on
the
same
tree
at
the
same
time
when
the
blossom
falls
off
there
grows
in
its
place
a
small
green
fruit
which
becomes
dark
red
as
it
ripens
this
fruit
is
not
unlike
a
cherry
and
is
very
good
to
eat
under
the
pulp
of
this
cherry
is
found
the
bean
or
berry
we
call
coffee
wrapped
in
a
fine
thin
skin
the
berry
is
at
first
very
soft
and
has
a
bad
taste
but
as
the
cherry
ripens
the
berry
grows
harder
and
the
fruit
becomes
a
shell
or
pod
of
a
deep
brown
color
the
berry
is
now
solid
and
its
color
is
a
translucent
green
each
shell
contains
two
seeds
rounded
on
one
side
and
flat
on
the
other
the
seeds
lie
with
the
flat
sides
together
and
in
one
highly
prized
variety
the
two
seeds
grow
together
forming
one
this
is
known
as
the
pea
berry
when
the
fruit
is
so
ripe
that
it
can
be
shaken
from
the
tree
the
husks
are
separated
from
the
berries
and
are
used
in
arabia
by
the
natives
while
the
berries
are
sold
the
young
plants
are
inserted
in
holes
from
twelve
to
eighteen
inches
deep
and
six
or
eight
feet
apart
if
left
to
themselves
they
would
grow
to
the
height
of
eighteen
or
twenty
feet
but
they
are
usually
dwarfed
by
pruning
so
that
the
fruit
may
be
easily
got
at
by
the
gatherer
thus
dwarfed
they
extend
their
branches
until
they
cover
the
whole
space
about
them
they
begin
to
yield
fruit
the
third
year
by
the
sixth
or
seventh
year
they
are
at
full
bearing
and
continue
to
bear
for
twenty
years
or
more
before
the
berry
can
be
used
it
undergoes
a
process
of
roasting
the
amount
of
aromatic
oil
brought
out
in
roasting
has
much
to
do
with
the
market
value
of
coffee
and
it
has
been
found
that
the
longer
the
raw
coffee
is
kept
the
richer
it
becomes
in
this
peculiar
oil
and
so
the
more
valuable
but
after
the
coffee
is
roasted
and
especially
after
it
is
ground
it
loses
its
aroma
rapidly
arabia
produces
the
celebrated
mocha
or
mokha
coffee
which
is
the
finest
in
the
world
but
little
or
none
of
the
best
product
is
ever
taken
out
of
that
country
the
java
coffee
from
the
east
indies
is
next
prized
but
the
best
quality
of
this
kind
is
also
quite
difficult
to
obtain
and
many
therefore
prefer
the
finest
grades
of
rio

america
to
such
mocha
and

i
do

there
can

my

is

a
some
plants
are
very

if
the

were
growing
in

i
should
not
complain
but
this
ugly
nettle
i
do
not
know
what
beauty
or
use
there
can
be
in
that
and
yet
nanny
there
is
more
beauty
use
and
instruction
in
a
nettle
than
even
in
a
lily
o
papa
how
can
you
make
that
out
put
on
your
gloves
pluck
up
that
nettle
and
let
us
examine
it
first
look
at
the
flower
a
the
flower
papa
i
see
no
flower
unless
those
little
ragged
knobs
are
flowers
which
have
neither
color
nor
smell
and
are
not
much
larger
than
the
heads
of
pins
here
take
this
magnifying
glass
and
examine
them
oh
i
see
now
every
little
knob
is
folded
up
in
leaves
like
a
rosebud
perhaps
there
is
a
flower
inside
try
take
this
pin
and
touch
the
knob
well
what
do
you
see
oh
how
curious
what
is
curious
a
the
moment
i
touched
it
it
flew
open
a
little
cloud
rose
out
like
enchantment
and
four
beautiful
little
stems
sprung
up
as
if
they
were
alive
and
now
that
i
look
again
with
the
glass
i
see
an
elegant
little
flower
as
nice
and
perfect
as
a
lily
itself
well
now
examine
the
leaves
oh
i
see
they
are
all
covered
over
with
little
bristles
and
when
i
examine
them
with
the
glass
i
see
a
little
bag
filled
with
a
juice
like
water
at
the
bottom
of
each
ha
these
are
the
things
which
stung
me
now
touch
the
little
bag
with
the
point
of
the
pin
a
when
i
press
the
bag
the
juice
runs
up
and
comes
out
at
the
small
point
at
the
top
so
i
suppose
the
little
thorn
must
be
hollow
inside
though
it
is
finer
than
the
point
of
my
cambric
needle
have
all
the
leaves
those
stings
a
no
papa
some
of
the
young
ones
are
quite
green
and
soft
like
velvet
and
i
may
handle
them
without
any
danger
now
look
at
the
stem
and
break
it
i
can
easily
crack
it
but
i
can
not
break
it
asunder
for
the
bark
is
so
strong
that
it
holds
it
together
well
now
you
see
there
are
more
curious
things
in
the
nettle
than
you
expected
a
yes
indeed
i
see
that
but
you
have
often
told
me
that
god
makes
nothing
without
its
use
and
i
am
sure
i
can
not
see
any
use
in
all
these
things
that
we
will
now
consider
you
saw
the
little
flower
burst
open
and
a
cloud
rose
you
say
like
enchantment
now
all
this
is
necessary
for
the
nature
of
the
plant
there
are
many
thousand
plants
in
the
world
and
it
has
pleased
god
in
his
wisdom
to
make
them
all
different
now
look
at
this
other
nettle
which
grew
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
you
see
that
it
is
not
exactly
like
the
one
you
have
just
examined
a
no
papa
this
has
little
flat
seeds
instead
of
flowers
very
right
my
dear
now
in
order
to
make
those
seeds
grow
it
is
necessary
that
the
little
flower
of
this
plant
and
the
seed
of
that
should
be
together
as
they
are
in
most
others
but
plants
can
not
walk
like
animals
the
wisdom
of
god
therefore
has
provided
a
remedy
for
this
when
the
little
flower
bursts
open
it
throws
out
a
fine
powder
which
you
saw
rise
like
a
cloud
this
is
conveyed
by
the
air
to
the
other
plant
and
when
it
falls
upon
the
seed
of
that
plant
it
gives
it
power
to
grow
and
makes
it
a
perfect
seed
which
in
its
turn
when
it
falls
to
the
ground
will
produce
a
new
plant
were
it
not
for
this
fine
powder
that
seed
would
never
be
perfect
or
complete
a
that
is
very
curious
indeed
and
i
see
the
use
of
the
little
cloud
and
the
flower
but
the
leaf
that
stung
me
of
what
use
can
that
be
there
dear
papa
i
am
afraid
i
puzzle
you
to
tell
me
that
even
these
stings
are
made
useful
to
man
the
poor
people
in
some
countries
use
them
instead
of
blisters
when
they
are
sick
those
leaves
which
do
not
sting
are
used
by
some
for
food
and
from
the
stalk
others
get
a
stringy
bark
which
answers
the
purpose
of
flax
thus
you
see
that
even
the
despised
nettle
is
not
made
in
vain
and
this
lesson
may
serve
to
teach
you
that
we
only
need
to
understand
the
works
of
god
to
see
that
in
goodness
and
wisdom
he
has
made
them
all
glass
an
instrument
used
to
make
objects
appear
larger
magic
art
apart
into
parts
that
which
removes
an
evil
carried
full
of
strings

of

university
he
died

i
will
show
you
what
is
beautiful
it
is
a
rose
fully
blown
see
how
she
sits
upon
her
mossy
stem
the
queen
of
flowers
her
leaves
glow
like
fire
the
air
is
filled
with
her
sweet
odor
she
is
the
delight
of
every
eye
but
there
is
one
fairer
than
the
rose
he
that
made
the
rose
is
more
beautiful
than
the
rose
he
is
altogether
lovely
he
is
the
delight
of
every
heart
i
will
show
you
what
is
strong
the
lion
is
strong
when
he
raiseth
himself
up
from
his
lair
when
he
shaketh
his
mane
when
the
voice
of
his
roaring
is
heard
the
cattle
of
the
field
fly
and
the
wild
beasts
of
the
desert
hide
themselves
for
he
is
terrible
but
he
who
made
the
lion
is
stronger
than
the
lion
he
can
do
all
things
he
gave
us
life
and
in
a
moment
can
take
it
away
and
no
one
can
save
us
from
his
hand
i
will
show
you
what
is
glorious
the
sun
is
glorious
when
he
shineth
in
the
clear
sky
when
he
sitteth
on
his
throne
in
the
heavens
and
looketh
abroad
over
the
earth
he
is
the
most
glorious
and
excellent
object
the
eye
can
behold
but
he
who
made
the
sun
is
more
glorious
than
the
sun
the
eye
can
not
look
on
his
dazzling
brightness
he
seeth
all
dark
places
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
the
light
of
his
countenance
is
over
all
the
world
this
great
being
is
god
he
made
all
things
but
he
is
more
excellent
than
all
that
he
has
made
he
is
the
creator
they
are
the
creatures
they
may
be
beautiful
but
he
is
beauty
they
may
be
strong
but
he

they
may

the
horse
uncle
thomas
well
boys
i
am
glad
to
see
you
again
since
i
last
saw
you
i
have
made
quite
a
tour
and
at
some
future
time
will
describe
to
you
what
i
have
seen
i
promised
at
this
meeting
however
to
tell
you
something
about
animals
and
i
propose
to
begin
with
the
horse
but
i
know
that
you
like
stories
better
than
lecturing
so
i
will
proceed
at
once
to
tell
you
some
which
i
have
gathered
for
you
frank
we
never
feel
tired
of
listening
to
you
uncle
thomas
we
know
you
always
have
something
curious
to
tell
us
uncle
thomas
well
then
frank
to
begin
at
once
with
the
horse
in
several
parts
of
the
world
there
are
to
be
found
large
herds
of
wild
horses
in
south
america
the
immense
plains
are
inhabited
by
them
and
it
is
said
that
ten
thousand
are
sometimes
found
in
a
single
herd
these
herds
are
always
preceded
by
a
leader
who
directs
their
motions
and
such
is
the
regularity
with
which
they
perform
their
movements
that
it
seems
as
if
they
could
hardly
be
surpassed
by
the
best
trained
cavalry
it
is
extremely
dangerous
for
travelers
to
meet
a
herd
of
this
description
when
they
are
unaccustomed
to
the
sight
of
such
a
mass
of
creatures
they
can
not
help
feeling
greatly
alarmed
at
their
rapid
and
apparently
irresistible
approach
the
trampling
of
the
animals
sounds
like
distant
thunder
and
such
is
the
rapidity
and
impetuosity
of
their
advance
that
it
seems
to
threaten
instant
destruction
sometimes
however
they
suddenly
stop
short
utter
a
loud
and
piercing
neigh
and
with
a
rapid
wheel
take
an
opposite
course
and
altogether
disappear
on
such
occasions
it
requires
great
care
in
the
traveler
to
prevent
his
horses
from
breaking
loose
and
escaping
with
the
wild
herd
in
those
countries
where
wild
horses
are
so
plentiful
the
inhabitants
do
not
take
the
trouble
to
raise
others
but
whenever
they
want
one
they
mount
upon
an
animal
accustomed
to
the
sport
and
gallop
over
the
plain
toward
a
herd
which
is
readily
found
at
no
great
distance
the
rider
gradually
approaches
some
stragglers
from
the
main
body
and
having
selected
the
one
he
wishes
he
dexterously
throws
the
lasso
which
is
a
long
rope
with
a
running
noose
and
is
firmly
fixed
to
his
saddle
either
over
the
wild
horse
head
or
in
such
a
manner
as
to
entangle
his
hind
legs
and
by
the
sudden
checking
of
his
own
horse
he
throws
the
captured
animal
over
on
its
side
in
an
instant
he
jumps
off
his
horse
wraps
his
cloak
round
the
head
of
the
captive
forces
a
bit
into
his
mouth
and
straps
a
saddle
on
his
back
he
then
removes
the
cloak
and
the
animal
starts
to
his
feet
with
equal
quickness
the
hunter
leaps
into
his
saddle
and
in
spite
of
the
kicking
of
the
captive
keeps
his
seat
till
being
wearied
out
with
his
efforts
the
horse
submits
to
the
guidance
of
his
new
master
and
is
reduced
to
complete
obedience
frank
but
uncle
thomas
are
all
horses
originally
wild
i
have
heard
that
arabia
is
famous
for
raising
horses
uncle
thomas
arabia
has
for
a
long
time
been
noted
for
the
beauty
and
speed
of
its
horses
it
is
not
strange
however
that
the
arabian
horse
should
be
the
most
excellent
when
we
consider
the
care
and
kindness
with
which
it
is
treated
one
of
the
best
stories
which
i
have
ever
heard
of
the
love
of
an
arabian
for
his
steed
is
that
related
of
an
arab
from
whom
an
english
officer
wished
to
purchase
his
horse
the
animal
was
a
bright
bay
mare
of
fine
form
and
great
beauty
and
the
owner
proud
of
her
appearance
and
qualities
paraded
her
before
the
englishman
tent
until
she
attracted
his
attention
on
being
asked
if
he
would
sell
her
what
will
you
give
me
was
the
reply
that
depends
upon
her
age
i
suppose
she
is
past
five
guess
again
said
he
four
look
at
her
mouth
said
the
arab
with
a
smile
on
examination
she
was
found
to
be
about
three
this
from
her
size
and
symmetry
greatly
increased
her
value
the
gentleman
said
i
will
give
you
eighty
tomans
nearly
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
little
more
if
you
please
said
the
fellow
somewhat
entertained
ninety
a
hundred
he
shook
his
head
and
smiled
the
officer
at
last
came
to
three
hundred
tomans
nearly
one
thousand
dollars
well
said
the
arab
you
need
not
tempt
me
further
you
are
a
rich
nobleman
and
i
am
told
have
loads
of
silver
and
gold
now
added
he
you
want
my
mare
but
you
shall
not
have
her
for
all
you
have
got
he
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
was
soon
out
of
the
reach
of
temptation
the
horse
can
swim
when
necessary
as
well
as
most
other
animals
although
he
is
not
very
fond
of
the
water
some
years
ago
a
vessel
was
driven
upon
the
rocks
on
the
coast
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
most
of
the
crew
fell
an
immediate
sacrifice
to
the
waves
those
who
were
left
were
seen
from
the
shore
clinging
to
the
different
pieces
of
the
wreck
the
sea
ran
so
high
that
no
boat
could
venture
off
to
their
assistance
meanwhile
a
planter
had
come
from
his
farm
to
be
a
spectator
of
the
shipwreck
his
heart
was
melted
at
the
sight
of
the
unhappy
seamen
and
knowing
the
bold
spirit
of
his
horse
and
his
excellence
as
a
swimmer
he
determined
to
make
a
desperate
effort
for
their
deliverance
having
blown
a
little
brandy
into
his
horse
nostrils
he
pushed
into
the
midst
of
the
breakers
at
first
both
horse
and
rider
disappeared
but
it
was
not
long
before
they
floated
to
the
surface
and
swam
up
to
the
wreck
when
taking
two
men
with
him
each
of
whom
held
on
by
one
of
his
boots
the
planter
brought
them
safe
to
shore
this
was
repeated
no
less
than
seven
times
and
he
saved
fourteen
lives
but
on
his
return
the
eighth
time
being
much
fatigued
and
meeting
a
tremendous
wave
he
lost
his
balance
and
sank
in
a
moment
his
horse
swam
safely
to
land
but
its

rider

xlviii
emulation
frank
father
was
speaking
to
a
friend
one
day
on
the
subject
of
competition
at
school
he
said
that
he
could
answer
for
it
that
envy
is
not
always
connected
with
it
he
had
been
excelled
by
many
but
did
not
recollect
ever
having
felt
envious
of
his
successful
rivals
nor
did
my
winning
many
a
prize
from
my
friend
birch
said
he
ever
lessen
his
friendship
for
me
in
support
of
the
truth
of
this
a
friend
who
was
present
related
an
anecdote
which
had
fallen
under
his
own
notice
in
a
school
in
his
neighborhood
at
this
school
the
sons
of
several
wealthy
farmers
and
others
who
were
poorer
received
instruction
frank
listened
with
great
attention
while
the
gentleman
gave
the
following
account
of
the
two
rivals
it
happened
that
the
son
of
a
rich
farmer
and
the
son
of
a
poor
widow
came
in
competition
for
the
head
of
their
class
they
were
so
nearly
equal
that
the
teacher
could
scarcely
decide
between
them
some
days
one
and
some
days
the
other
gained
the
head
of
the
class
it
was
determined
by
seeing
who
should
be
at
the
head
of
the
class
for
the
greater
number
of
days
in
the
week
the
widow
son
by
the
last
day
trial
gained
the
victory
and
kept
his
place
the
following
week
till
the
school
was
dismissed
for
the
holidays
when
they
met
again
the
widow
son
did
not
appear
and
the
son
being
next
to
him
might
now
have
been
at
the
head
of
his
class
instead
of
seizing
the
vacant
place
however
he
went
to
the
widow
house
to
inquire
what
could
be
the
cause
of
her
son
absence
poverty
was
the
cause
the
poor
woman
found
that
she
was
not
able
with
her
utmost
efforts
to
continue
to
pay
for
the
tuition
and
books
of
her
son
and
so
he
poor
fellow
had
been
compelled
to
give
up
his
schooling
and
to
return
to
labor
for
her
support
the
farmer
son
out
of
the
allowance
of
pocket
money
which
his
father
gave
him
bought
all
the
necessary
books
and
paid
for
the
tuition
of
his
rival
he
also
permitted
him
to
be
brought
back
again
to
the
head
of
his
class
where
he
continued
for
some
time
at
the
expense
of

across
the
lonely
beach
we
flit
one
little
sandpiper
and
i
and
fast
i
gather
bit
by

scattered
driftwood
bleached

the

scud
black

across

like

i

the

as
fast
we
flit
across
the
beach
one
little
sandpiper
and
i
i
watch
him
as
he
skims
along
uttering
his
sweet
and
mournful
cry
he
starts
not
at
my
fitful
song
nor
flash
of
fluttering
drapery
he
has
no

of
any

scans
me

wilt
thou

my

the
right
way
adapted
from
a
story
by
frank
stockton
he
was
born
at
philadelphia
april
and
when
quite
a
young
boy
used
to
write
stories
for
his
own
pleasure
he
was
once
a
designer
and
engraver
on
wood
and
afterwards
an
editor
but
he
now
devotes
himself
entirely
to
writing
not
only
for
young
but
also
for
grown
people
o
andy
said
little
jenny
murdock
i
so
glad
you
came
along
this
way
i
ca
get
over
ca
get
over
said
andrew
why
what
the
matter
the
bridge
is
gone
said
jenny
when
i
came
across
after
breakfast
it
was
there
and
now
it
over
on
the
other
side
and
how
can
i
get
back
home
why
so
it
is
said
andrew
it
was
all
right
when
i
came
over
a
little
while
ago
but
old
donald
pulls
it
on
the
other
side
every
morning
after
he
has
driven
his
cows
across
and
i
do
think
he
has
any
right
to
do
it
i
suppose
he
thinks
the
bridge
was
made
for
him
and
his
cows
now
i
must
go
down
to
the
big
bridge
andy
and
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
i
afraid
to
go
through
all
those
dark
woods
by
myself
said
jenny
but
i
ca
go
jenny
said
andrew
it
nearly
school
time
now
andrew
was
a
scotch
boy
and
a
fine
fellow
he
was
next
to
the
head
of
his
school
and
he
was
as
good
at
play
as
he
was
at
his
book
jenny
murdock
his
most
particular
friend
was
a
little
girl
who
lived
very
near
andrew
home
she
had
no
brothers
or
sisters
but
andrew
had
always
been
as
good
as
a
brother
to
her
and
therefore
when
she
stood
by
the
water
edge
that
morning
just
ready
to
burst
into
tears
she
thought
all
her
troubles
over
when
she
saw
andrew
coming
along
the
road
he
had
always
helped
her
out
of
her
troubles
before
and
she
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
do
it
now
she
had
crossed
the
creek
in
search
of
wild
flowers
and
when
she
wished
to
return
had
found
the
bridge
removed
as
andrew
supposed
by
old
donald
mckensie
who
pastured
his
cows
on
this
side
of
the
creek
this
stream
was
not
very
wide
nor
very
deep
at
its
edges
but
the
center
it
was
four
or
five
feet
deep
and
in
the
spring
the
water
ran
very
swiftly
so
that
wading
across
it
either
by
cattle
or
men
was
quite
a
difficult
undertaking
as
for
jenny
she
could
not
get
across
at
all
without
a
bridge
and
there
was
none
nearer
than
the
wagon
bridge
a
mile
and
a
half
below
you
will
go
with
me
andy
wo
you
said
the
little
girl
and
be
late
to
school
said
he
i
have
not
been
late
yet
you
know
jenny
perhaps
dominie
black
will
think
you
have
been
sick
or
had
to
mind
the
cows
said
jenny
he
wo
think
so
unless
i
tell
him
said
andrew
and
you
know
i
wo
do
that
if
we
were
to
run
all
the
way
would
you
be
too
late
said
jenny
if
we
were
to
run
all
the
way
to
the
bridge
and
i
were
to
run
all
the
way
back
i
should
not
get
to
school
till
after
copy
time
i
expect
every
minute
to
hear
the
school
bell
ring
said
andrew
but
what
can
i
do
then
said
poor
little
jenny
i
ca
wait
here
till
school
out
and
i
do
want
to
go
up
to
the
schoolhouse
for
all
the
boys
to
laugh
at
me
no
said
andrew
reflecting
very
seriously
i
must
take
you
home
some
way
or
other
it
wo
do
to
leave
you
here
and
no
matter
where
you
might
stay
your
mother
would
be
very
much
troubled
about
you
yes
said
jenny
she
would
think
i
was
drowned
time
pressed
and
jenny
countenance
became
more
and
more
overcast
but
andrew
could
think
of
no
way
in
which
he
could
take
the
little
girl
home
without
being
late
and
losing
his
standing
in
the
school
it
was
impossible
to
get
her
across
the
stream
at
any
place
nearer
than
the
big
bridge
he
would
not
take
her
that
way
and
make
up
a
false
story
to
account
for
his
lateness
at
school
and
he
could
not
leave
her
alone
or
take
her
with
him
what
was
to
be
done
while
several
absurd
and
impracticable
plans
were
passing
through
his
brain
the
school
bell
began
to
ring
and
he
must
start
immediately
to
reach
the
schoolhouse
in
time
and
now
his
anxiety
and
perplexity
became
more
intense
than
ever
and
jenny
looking
up
into
his
troubled
countenance
began
to
cry
andrew
who
had
never
before
failed
to
be
at
the
school
door
before
the
first
tap
of
the
bell
began
to
despair
was
there
nothing
to
be
done
yes
a
happy
thought
passed
through
his
mind
how
strange
that
he
should
not
have
thought
of
it
before
he
would
ask
dominie
black
to
let
him
take
jenny
home
what
could
be
more
sensible
and
straightforward
than
such
a
plan
of
course
the
good
old
schoolmaster
gave
andrew
the
desired
permission
and
everything
ended
happily
but
the
best
thing
about
the
whole
affair
was
the
lesson
that
the
young
scotch
boy
learned
that
day
the
lesson
was
this
when
we
are
puzzling
our
brains
with
plans
to
help
ourselves
out
of
trouble
let
us
always
stop
a
moment
in
our
planning
and
try
to
think
if
there
is
not
some
simple
way
out
of
the
difficulty
which
shall
be
in
every
respect
perfectly
right
if
we
do
this
we
shall
probably
find
a
way
more
easy
and
satisfactory
than
any
which
we
can
devise
not
ordinary
worthy
of
attention
chief
the
scotch
name
for
thinking
earnestly
with
gloom
to
state
the
reasons
im
not
possible
care
trouble
of
mind
plan
contrive
why
could
not
jenny
cross
the
stream
whom
did
she
ask
to
help
her
what
can
you
tell
about
andrew
who
was
jenny
murdock
what
did
jenny
wish
andrew
to
do
why
could
he
not
go
with
her
would
it
have
been
right
for
andrew
to
have
told
an
untruth
even
to
help
jenny
out
of
trouble
what
did
he
finally
do
what
does
this
lesson
teach
us
to
do
in
case
of
trouble
li
the
golden
rule
to
act
with
integrity
and
good
faith
was
such
a
habit
with
susan
that
she
had
never
before
thought
of
examining
the
golden
rule
all
things
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
even
so
to
them
but
the
longer
she
reflected
upon
it
the
stronger
was
her
conviction
that
she
did
not
always
obey
the
precept
at
length
she
appealed
to
her
mother
for
its
meaning
it
implies
said
her
mother
in
the
first
place
a
total
destruction
of
all
selfishness
for
a
man
who
loves
himself
better
than
his
neighbors
can
never
do
to
others
as
he
would
have
others
do
to
him
we
are
bound
not
only
to
do
but
to
feel
toward
others
as
we
would
have
others
feel
toward
us
remember
it
is
much
easier
to
reprove
the
sin
of
others
than
to
overcome
temptation
when
it
assails
ourselves
a
man
may
be
perfectly
honest
and
yet
very
selfish
but
the
command
implies
something
more
than
mere
honesty
it
requires
charity
as
well
as
integrity
the
meaning
of
the
command
is
fully
explained
in
the
parable
of
the
good
samaritan
the
levite
who
passed
by
the
wounded
man
without
offering
him
assistance
may
have
been
a
man
of
great
honesty
but
he
did
not
do
unto
the
poor
stranger
as
he
would
have
wished
others
to
do
unto
him
susan
pondered
carefully
and
seriously
on
what
her
mother
had
said
when
she
thought
over
her
past
conduct
a
blush
of
shame
crept
to
her
cheeks
and
a
look
of
sorrow
into
her
eyes
as
many
little
acts
of
selfishness
and
unkindness
came
back
to
her
memory
she
resolved
that
for
the
future
both
in
great
things
and
small
she
would
remember
and
follow
the
golden
rule
it
was
not
long
after
this
that
an
opportunity
occurred
of
trying
susan
principles
one
saturday
evening
when
she
went
as
usual
to
farmer
thompson
inn
to
receive
the
price
of
her
mother
washing
for
the
boarders
which
amounted
to
five
dollars
she
found
the
farmer
in
the
stable
yard
he
was
apparently
in
a
terrible
rage
with
some
horse
dealers
with
whom
he
had
been
bargaining
he
held
in
his
hand
an
open
pocketbook
full
of
bills
and
scarcely
noticing
the
child
as
she
made
her
request
except
to
swear
at
her
as
usual
for
troubling
him
when
he
was
busy
he
handed
her
a
bank
note
glad
to
escape
so
easily
susan
hurried
out
of
the
gate
and
then
pausing
to
pin
the
money
safely
in
the
folds
of
her
shawl
she
discovered
that
he
had
given
her
two
bills
instead
of
one
she
looked
around
nobody
was
near
to
share
her
discovery
and
her
first
impulse
was
joy
at
the
unexpected
prize
it
is
mine
all
mine
said
she
to
herself
i
will
buy
mother
a
new
cloak
with
it
and
she
can
give
her
old
one
to
sister
mary
and
then
mary
can
go
to
the
sunday
school
with
me
next
winter
i
wonder
if
it
will
not
buy
a
pair
of
shoes
for
brother
tom
too
at
that
moment
she
remembered
that
he
must
have
given
it
to
her
by
mistake
and
therefore
she
had
no
right
to
it
but
again
the
voice
of
the
tempter
whispered
he
gave
it
and
how
do
you
know
that
he
did
not
intend
to
make
you
a
present
of
it
keep
it
he
will
never
know
it
even
if
it
should
be
a
mistake
for
he
had
too
many
such
bills
in
that
great
pocketbook
to
miss
one
while
this
conflict
was
going
on
in
her
mind
between
good
and
evil
she
was
hurrying
homeward
as
fast
as
possible
yet
before
she
came
in
sight
of
her
home
she
had
repeatedly
balanced
the
comforts
which
the
money
would
buy
against
the
sin
of
wronging
her
neighbor
as
she
crossed
the
little
bridge
over
the
narrow
creek
before
her
mother
door
her
eye
fell
upon
a
rustic
seat
which
they
had
occupied
during
the
conversation
i
have
before
narrated
instantly
the
words
of
scripture
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
even
so
to
them
sounded
in
her
ears
like
a
trumpet
turning
suddenly
round
as
if
flying
from
some
unseen
peril
the
child
hastened
along
the
road
with
breathless
speed
until
she
found
herself
once
more
at
farmer
thompson
gate
what
do
you
want
now
asked
the
gruff
old
fellow
as
he
saw
her
again
at
his
side
sir
you
paid
me
two
bills
instead
of
one
said
she
trembling
in
every
limb
two
bills
did
i
let
me
see
well
so
i
did
but
did
you
just
find
it
out
why
did
you
not
bring
it
back
sooner
susan
blushed
and
hung
her
head
you
wanted
to
keep
it
i
suppose
said
he
well
i
am
glad
your
mother
was
more
honest
than
you
or
i
should
have
been
five
dollars
poorer
and
none
the
wiser
my
mother
knows
nothing
about
it
sir
said
susan
i
brought
it
back
before
i
went
home
the
old
man
looked
at
the
child
and
as
he
saw
the
tears
rolling
down
her
checks
he
seemed
touched
by
her
distress
putting
his
band
in
his
pocket
he
drew
out
a
shilling
and
offered
it
to
her
no
sir
i
thank
you
sobbed
she
i
do
not
want
to
be
paid
for
doing
right
i
only
wish
you
would
not
think
me
dishonest
for
indeed
it
was
a
sore
temptation
oh
sir
if
you
had
ever
seen
those
you
love
best
wanting
the
common
comforts
of
life
you
would
know
how
hard
it
is
for
us
always
to
do
unto
others
as
we
would
have
others
do
unto
us
the

the
selfish
man

surrounded
with

kind
of
wall
up
against
it
of
turf
about
two
feet
thick
on
the
outside
and
after
some
time
i
think
it
was
a
year
and
a
half
i
raised
rafters
from
it
leaning
to
the
rock
and
thatched
or
covered
it
with
boughs
of
trees
and
such
things
as
i
could
get
to
keep
out
the
rain
which
i
found
at
some
times
of
the
year
very
violent
i
have
already
observed
how
i
brought
all
my
goods
into
this
pale
and
into
the
cave
which
i
had
made
behind
me
but
i
must
observe
too
that
at
first
this
was
a
confused
heap
of
goods
which
as
they
lay
in
no
order
took
up
all
my
place
so
that
i
had
no
room
to
turn
myself
so
i
set
to
work
to
enlarge
my
cave
and
work
farther
into
the
earth
for
it
was
a
loose
sandy
rock
which
yielded
easily
to
the
labor
i
bestowed
upon
it
and
so
when
i
found
that
i
was
pretty
safe
as
to
beasts
of
prey
i
worked
sideways
into
the
rock
and
then
turning
to
the
right
again
worked
quite
out
and
made
me
a
door
to
come
out
on
the
outside
of
my
pale
or
fortification
this
gave
me
not
only
egress
and
regress
as
it
was
a
back
way
to
my
tent
and
to
my
storehouse
but
gave
me
room
to
stow
my
goods
and
now
i
began
to
apply
myself
to
make
such
necessary
things
as
i
found
i
most
wanted
particularly
a
chair
and
a
table
for
without
these
i
was
not
able
to
enjoy
the
few
comforts
i
had
in
the
world
i
could
not
write
or
eat
or
do
several
things
with
so
much
pleasure
without
a
table
so
i
went
to
work
i
had
never
handled
a
tool
in
my
life
and
yet
in
time
by
labor
application
and
contrivance
i
found
that
i
wanted
nothing
but
i
could
have
made
it
especially
if
i
had
had
tools
however
i
made
abundance
of
things
even
without
tools
and
some
with
no
more
tools
than
an
adz
and
a
hatchet
which
perhaps
were
never
made
that
way
before
and
that
with
infinite
labor
for
example
if
i
wanted
a
board
i
had
no
other
way
but
to
cut
down
a
tree
set
it
before
me
and
hew
it
flat
on
either
side
with
my
ax
till
i
had
brought
it
to
be
as
thin
as
a
plank
and
then
dub
it
smooth
with
my
adz
it
is
true
by
this
method
i
could
make
but
one
board
out
of
a
whole
tree
but
this
i
had
no
remedy
for
but
patience
any
more
than
i
had
for
the
prodigious
deal
of
time
and
labor
which
it
took
me
to
make
a
plank
or
board
but
my
time
or
labor
was
little
worth
and
so
it
was
as
well
employed
one
way
as
another
however
i
made
me
a
table
and
a
chair
as
i
observed
above
and
this
i
did
out
of
the
short
pieces
of
boards
which
i
brought
on
my
raft
from
the
ship
but
when
i
had
wrought
out
some
boards
as
above
i
made
large
shelves
of
the
breadth
of
a
foot
and
a
half
one
over
another
all
along
one
side
of
my
cave
to
lay
all
my
tools
nails
and
ironwork
on
and
in
a
word
to
separate
everything
at
large
in
their
places
that
i
might
come
easily
at
them
i
knocked
pieces
into
the
wall
of
the
rock
to
hang
my
guns
and
all
things
that
would
hang
up
so
that
had
my
cave
been
seen
it
would
have
looked
like
a
general
magazine
of
all
necessary
things
and
i
had
everything
so
ready
at
my
hand
that
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
see
all
my
goods
in
such
order
and
especially
to
find
my
stock
of
all
necessaries

but
had
any
man
in
england
met
such
a
man
as
i
was
it
must
either
have
frightened
him
or
raised
a
great
deal
of
laughter
and
as
i
frequently
stood
still
to
look
at
myself
i
could
not
but
smile
at
the
notion
of
my
traveling
through
yorkshire
in
such
a
dress
i
had
a
great
high
shapeless
cap
made
of
a
goat
skin
with
a
flap
hanging
down
behind
as
well
to
keep
the
sun
from
me
as
to
shoot
the
rain
off
from
running
into
my
neck
nothing
being
so
hurtful
in
these
climates
as
the
rain
upon
the
flesh
under
the
clothes
i
had
a
short
jacket
of
goatskin
the
skirts
coming
down
to
about
the
middle
of
the
thighs
and
a
pair
of
breeches
of
the
same
the
breeches
were
made
of
the
skin
of
an
old
goat
and
the
hair
hung
down
such
a
length
on
either
side
that
it
reached
to
the
middle
of
my
legs
like
pantaloons
stockings
and
shoes
i
had
none
but
i
made
a
pair
of
something
i
scarce
know
what
to
call
them
like
buskins
to
flap
over
my
legs
and
lace
on
either
side
like
spatterdashes
but
they
were
of
a
most
barbarous
shape
as
indeed
were
all
the
rest
of
my
clothes
i
had
on
a
broad
belt
of
goatskin
dried
which
i
drew
together
with
two
thongs
of
the
same
instead
of
buckles
and
in
a
kind
of
frog
on
each
side
of
this
instead
of
a
sword
and
dagger
hung
a
little
saw
and
hatchet
one
on
one
side
and
one
on
the
other
i
had
another
belt
not
so
broad
and
fastened
in
the
same
manner
which
hung
over
my
shoulder
and
at
the
end
of
it
under
my
left
arm
hung
two
pouches
both
made
of
goatskin
too
in
one
of
which
hung
my
powder
in
the
other
my
shot
at
my
back
i
carried
my
basket
on
my
shoulder
my
gun
and
over
my
head
a
great
clumsy
ugly
goatskin
umbrella
but
which
after
all
was
the
most
necessary
thing
i
had
about
me
next
to
my
gun
as
for
my
face
the
color
of
it
was
really
not
so
dark
as
one
might
expect
from
a
man
not
at
all
careful
of
it
and
living
within
nine
or
ten
degrees
of
the
equator
my
beard
i
had
once
suffered
to
grow
till
it
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
yard
long
but
as
i
had
both
scissors
and
razors
sufficient
i
had
cut
it
pretty
short
except
what
grew
on
my
upper
lip
which
i
had
trimmed
into
a
large
pair
of
mahometan
whiskers
such
as
i
had
seen
worn
by
some
turks
of
these
mustaches
or
whiskers
i
will
not
say
that
they
were
long
enough
to
hang
my
hat
upon
them
but
they
were
of
a
length
and
shape
monstrous
enough
and
such
as
in
england
would
have
passed
for
frightful
but
all
this
is
by
the
bye
for
as
to
my
figure
i
had
so
few
to
observe
me
that
it
was
of
no
manner
of
consequence
so
i
say
no
more
on
that
part
coverings
for
the
feet
coming
some
distance
up
the
leg
and
fit
for
a
defense
against
thorns

for

them

the
novel
robinson
crusoe
was
first
published
in
it
was
founded
on
the
adventures
of
alexander
selkirk
a
scotch
buccaneer
who
was
cast
on
the
island
of
juan
fernandez
west
of
south
america
in
and
remained
there
for
more
than
four
years
before
he
was
rescued
yorkshire
this
was
the
district
of
england
where
according
to
the
story
robinson
crusoe
was
born
and
passed
his
early
life
breeches
at
this
period
knee
breeches
were
worn
almost
altogether
in
england
those
referred
to
here
appear
to
have
been
loose
about
the
knee
and
not
close
as
usual
instead
of
sword
and
dagger
it
was
then
the
fashion
in
england
for
gentlemen
to
wear
such
weapons
such
as
in
england
would
have
passed
for
frightful

was
not
the
custom
in
england

wear

full
beard

was
borne
one
day

knowledge
is

what
an
excellent
thing
is
knowledge
said
a
hustling
little
man
to
one
who
was
much
older
than
himself
knowledge
is
an
excellent
thing
repeated
he
my
boys
know
more
at
six
and
seven
years
old
than
i
did
at
twelve
they
can
read
all
sorts
of
books
and
talk
on
all
sorts
of
subjects
the
world
is
a
great
deal
wiser
than
it
used
to
he
everybody
knows
something
of
everything
now
do
you
not
think
sir
that
knowledge
is
all
excellent
thing
why
sir
replied
the
old
man
looking
grave
that
depends
entirely
upon
the
use
to
which
it
is
applied
it
may
be
a
blessing
or
a
curse
knowledge
is
only
an
increase
of
power
and
power
may
be
a
bad
as
well
as
a
good
thing
that
is
what
i
can
not
understand
said
the
bustling
little
man
how
can
power
he
a
bad
thing
i
will
tell
you
meekly
replied
the
old
man
and
thus
he
went
on
when
the
power
of
a
horse
is
under
restraint
the
animal
is
useful
in
bearing
burdens
drawing
loads
and
carrying
his
master
but
when
that
power
is
unrestrained
the
horse
breaks
his
bridle
dashes
to
pieces
the
carriage
that
he
draws
or
throws
his
rider
i
see
said
the
little
man
when
the
water
of
a
large
pond
is
properly
conducted
by
trenches
it
renders
the
fields
around
fertile
but
when
it
bursts
through
its
banks
it
sweeps
everything
before
it
and
destroys
the
produce
of
the
fields
i
see
said
the
little
man
i
see
when
the
ship
is
steered
aright
the
sail
that
she
hoists
enables
her
sooner
to
get
into
port
but
if
steered
wrong
the
more
sail
she
carries
the
further
will
she
go
out
of
her
course
i
see
said
the
little
man
i
see
clearly
well
then
continued
the
old
man
if
you
see
these
things
so
clearly
i
hope
you
can
see
too
that
knowledge
to
be
a
good
thing
must
be
rightly
applied
god
grace
in
the
heart
will
render
the
knowledge
of
the
head
a
blessing
but
without
this
it
may
prove
to
us
no
better
than
a
curse
i
see
i
see
said
the
little
man
i
see

very
active

what
is

subject
of

is

it
always

relate
the
several
examples
of
power
wrongly
used
if
we
use
the
powers
that
god
has
given
us
for
bad
purposes
what
will
our
knowledge

by

i
suppose
you
all
my
boys
are
looking
for
some
sort
of
success
in
life
it
is
right
that
you
should
but
what
are
your
notions
of
success
to
get
rich
as
soon
as
possible
without
regard
to
the
means
by
which
your
wealth
is
acquired
there
is
no
true
success
in
that
when
you
have
gained
millions
you
may
yet
be
poorer
than
when
you
had
nothing
and
it
is
that
same
reckless
ambition
which
has
brought
many
a
bright
and
capable
boy
not
to
great
estate
at
last
but
to
miserable
failure
and
disgrace
not
to
a
palace
but
to
a
prison
wealth
rightly
got
and
rightly
used
rational
enjoyment
power
fame
these
are
all
worthy
objects
of
ambition
but
they
are
not
the
highest
objects
and
you
may
acquire
them
all
without
achieving
true
success
but
if
whatever
you
seek
you
put
good
will
into
all
your
actions
you
are
sure
of
the
best
success
at
last
for
whatever
else
you
gain
or
miss
you
are
building
up
a
noble
and
beautiful
character
which
is
not
only
the
best
of
possessions
in
this
world
but
also
is
about
all
you
can
expect
to
take
with
you
into
the
next
i
say
good
will
in
all
your
actions
you
are
not
simply
to
be
kind
and
helpful
to
others
but
whatever
you
do
give
honest
earnest
purpose
to
it
thomas
is
put
by
his
parents
to
learn
a
business
but
thomas
does
not
like
to
apply
himself
very
closely
what
the
use
he
says
i
not
paid
much
and
i
not
going
to
work
much
i
get
along
just
as
easily
as
i
can
and
have
as
good
times
as
i
can
so
he
shirks
his
tasks
and
instead
of
thinking
about
his
interests
or
his
own
self
improvement
gives
his
mind
to
trifles
often
to
evil
things
which
in
their
ruinous
effects
upon
his
life
are
not
trifles
as
soon
as
he
is
free
from
his
daily
duties
he
is
off
with
his
companions
having
what
they
call
a
good
time
his
heart
is
with
them
even
while
his
hands
are
employed
in
the
shop
or
store
he
does
nothing
thoroughly
well
not
at
all
for
want
of
talent
but
solely
for
lack
of
good
will
he
is
not
preparing
himself
to
be
one
of
those
efficient
clerks
or
workmen
who
are
always
in
demand
and
who
receive
the
highest
wages
there
is
a
class
of
people
who
are
the
pest
of
every
community
workmen
who
do
not
know
their
trade
men
of
business
ignorant
of
the
first
principles
of
business
they
can
never
be
relied
upon
to
do
well
anything
they
undertake
they
are
always
making
blunders
which
other
people
have
to
suffer
for
and
which
react
upon
themselves
they
are
always
getting
out
of
employment
and
failing
in
business
to
make
up
for
what
they
lack
in
knowledge
and
thoroughness
they
often
resort
to
trick

contemptible
but
criminal
thomas
is
preparing
himself
to
be
one
of
this
class
you
can
not
boys
expect
to
raise
a
good
crop
from
evil
seed
by
thomas
side
works
another
boy
whom
we
will
call
james
a
lad
of
only
ordinary
capacity
very
likely
if
thomas
and
all
the
other
boys
did
their
best
there
would
be
but
small
chance
for
james
ever
to
become
eminent
but
he
has
something
better
than
talent
he
brings
good
will
to
his
work
whatever
he
learns
he
learns
so
well
that
it
becomes
a
part
of
himself
his
employers
find
that
they
can
depend
upon
jim
customers
soon
learn
to
like
and
trust
him
by
diligence
good
habits
cheerful
and
kindly
conduct
he
is
laying
the
foundation
of
a
generous
manhood
and
a
genuine
success
in

boys
by
slighting
your
tasks
you
hurt
yourself
more
than
you
wrong
your
employer
by
honest
service
you
benefit
yourself
more
than
you
help
him
if
you
were
aiming
at
mere
worldly
advancement
only
i
should
still
say
that
good
will
was
the
very
best
investment
you
could
make
in
business
by
cheating
a
customer
you
gain
only
a
temporary
and
unreal
advantage
by
serving
him
with
right
good
will
doing
by
him
as
you
would
be
done
by
you
not
only
secure
his
confidence
but
also
his
good
will
in
return
but
this
is
a
sordid
consideration
compared
with
the
inward
satisfaction
the
glow
and
expansion
of

which
attend
a
good
action
done

a
chinese
story
by
christopher
pearse
cranch
who
was
born
at
alexandria
then
in
he
has
written
some
children
stories
besides
numerous
poems
but
his
greatest
literary
work
is
the
aeneid
of
vergil
translated
into
english
blank
verse
he
died
in
cambridge
two
young
fellows
chang
and
ching
over
their
chopsticks
idly
chattering
fell
to
disputing
which
could
see
the
best
at
last
they
agreed
to
put
it
to
the
test
said
chang
a
marble
tablet
so
i
hear
is
placed
upon
the
temple
near
with
an
inscription
on
it
let
us
go
and
read
it
since
you
boast
your
optics
so
standing
together
at
a
certain
place
in
front
where
we
the
letters
just
may
trace
then
he
who
quickest
reads
the
inscription
there
the
palm
for
keenest
eyes
henceforth
shall
bear
agreed
said
ching
but
let
us
try
it
soon
suppose
we
say
afternoon
nay
not
so
soon
said
chang
i
bound
to
go
a
day
ride
from
and
be
ready
till
the
following
day
at
ten
on
thursday
let
us
say
so
was
arranged
but
ching
was
time
by
the
forelock
he
resolved
to
take
and
to
the
temple
went
at
once
and
read
upon
the
tablet
to
the
illustrious
dead
the
chief
of
mandarins
the
great
scarce
had
he
gone
when
stealthily
came
chang
who
read
the
same
but
peering
closer
he
spied
in
a
corner
what
ching
failed
to
see
the
words
this
tablet
is
erected
here
by
those
to
whom
the
great
was
dear
so
on
the
appointed
day
both
innocent
as
babes
of
course
these
honest
fellows
went
and
took
their
distant
station
and
ching
said
i
can
read
plainly
the
illustrious
dead
the
chief
of
mandarins
the
great
and
is
that
all
that
you
can
spell
said
chang
i
see
what
you
have
read
but
furthermore
in
smaller
letters
toward
the
temple
door
quite
plain
tablet
is
erected
here
by
those
to
whom
the
great
was
dear
my
friend
there
are
no
such
words
said
ching
they
there
said
chang
if
i
see
anything
as
clear
as
daylight
patent
eyes
indeed
you
have
cried
ching
do
you
think
i
can
not
read
not
at
this
distance
as
i
can
chang
said
if
what
you
say
you
saw
is
all
you
read
in
fine
they
quarreled
and
their
wrath
increased
till
chang
said
let
us
leave
it
to
the
priest
lo
here
he
comes
to
meet
us
it
is
well
said
honest
ching
no
falsehood
he
will
tell
the
good
man
heard
their
artless
story
through
and
said
i
think
dear
sirs
there
must
be
few
blest
with
such
wondrous
eyes
as
those
you
wear
there
no
such
tablet
or
inscription
there
there
was

it
is
true

moved
away
and
placed
within

lxx
the
way
to
be
happy
every
child
must
observe
how
much
more
happy
and
beloved
some
children
are
than
others
there
are
some
children
you
always
love
to
be
with
they
are
happy
themselves
and
they
make
you
happy
there
are
others
whom
you
always
avoid
they
seem
to
have
no
friends
no
person
can
be
happy
without
friends
the
heart
is
formed
for
love
and
can
not
be
happy
without
it
is
not
in
titles
nor
in
rank
is
not
in
wealth
like
london
bank
to
make
us
truly
blest
if
happiness
have
not
her
seat
and
center
in
the
breast
we
may
be
wise
or
rich
or
great
but
never
can
be
blest
but
you
can
not
receive
affection
unless
you
will
also
give
it
you
can
not
find
others
to
love
you
unless
you
will
also
love
them
love
is
only
to
be
obtained
by
giving
love
in
return
hence
the
importance
of
cultivating
a
good
disposition
you
can
not
be
happy
without
it
i
have
sometimes
heard
a
girl
say
i
know
that
i
am
very
unpopular
at
school
now
this
plainly
shows
that
she
is
not
amiable
if
your
companions
do
not
love
you
it
is
your
own
fault
they
can
not
help
loving
you
if
you
will
be
kind
and
friendly
if
you
are
not
loved
it
is
a
good
proof
that
you
do
not
deserve
to
be
loved
it
is
true
that
a
sense
of
duty
may
at
times
render
it
necessary
for
you
to
do
that
which
will
displease
your
companions
but
if
it
is
seen
that
you
have
a
noble
spirit
that
you
are
above
selfishness
that
you
are
willing
to
make
sacrifices
to
promote
the
happiness
of
others
you
will
never
be
in
want
of
friends
you
must
not
regard
it
as
your
misfortune
that
others
do
not
love
you
but
your
fault
it
is
not
beauty
it
is
not
wealth
that
will
give
you
friends
your
heart
must
glow
with
kindness
if
you
would
attract
to
yourself
the
esteem
and
affection
of
those
around
you
you
are
little
aware
how
much
the
happiness
of
your
whole
life
depends
upon
the
cultivation
of
a
good
disposition
if
you
will
adopt
the
resolution
that
you
will
confer
favors
whenever
you
can
you
will
certainly
be
surrounded
by
ardent
friends
begin
upon
this
principle
in
childhood
and
act
upon
it
through
life
and
you
will
make
yourself
happy
and
promote
the
happiness
of
all
within
your
influence
you
go
to
school
on
a
cold
winter
morning
a
bright
fire
is
blazing
in
the
stove
surrounded
with
boys
struggling
to
get
near
it
to
warm
themselves
after
you
are
slightly
warmed
a
schoolmate
comes
in
suffering
with
cold
here
james
you
pleasantly
call
out
to
him
i
am
almost
warm
you
may
have
my
place
as
you
slip
aside
to
allow
him
to
take
your
place
at
the
fire
will
he
not
feel
that
you
are
kind
the
worst
boy
in
the
world
can
not
help
admiring
such
generosity
and
even
though
he
be
so
ungrateful
as
not
to
return
the
favor
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
he
will
be
your
friend
as
far
as
he
is
capable
of
friendship
if
you
will
always
act
upon
this
principle
you
will
never
want
for
friends
suppose
some
day
you
are
out
with
your
companions
playing
ball
after
you
have
been
playing
for
some
time
another
boy
comes
along
he
can
not
be
chosen
upon
either
side
for
there
is
no
one
to
match
him
henry
you
say
you
may
take
my
place
a
little
while
and
i
will
rest
you
throw
yourself
down
upon
the
grass
while
henry
fresh
and
vigorous
takes
your
bat
and
engages
in
the
game
he
knows
that
you
give
up
to
oblige
him
and
how
can
he
help
liking
you
for
it
the
fact
is
that
neither
man
nor
child
can
cultivate
such
a
spirit
of
generosity
and
kindness
without
attracting
affection
and
esteem
look
and
see
which
of
your
companions
have
the
most
friends
and
you
will
find
that
they
are
those
who
have
this
noble
spirit
who
are
willing
to
deny
themselves
that
they
may
make
others
happy
there
is
but
one
way
to
make
friends
and
that
is
by
being
friendly
to
others
perhaps
some
child
who
reads
this
feels
conscious
of
being
disliked
and
yet
desires
to
have
the
affection
of
his
companions
you
ask
me
what
you
shall
do
i
will
tell
you
i
will
give
you
an
infallible
rule
do
all
in
your
power
to
make
others
happy
be
willing
to
make
sacrifices
that
you
may
promote
the
happiness
of
others
this
is
the
way
to
make
friends
and
the
only
way
when
you
are
playing
with
your
brothers
and
sisters
at
home
be
always
ready
to
give
them
more
than
their
share
of
privileges
manifest
an
obliging
disposition
and
they
can
not
but
regard
you
with
affection
in
all
your
intercourse
with
others
at
home
or
abroad
let
these
feelings
influence
you
and
you
will
receive
a
rich
reward
cherishing
encouraging
not
pleasing
others
those
who
keep
company
with
anyone
things
given
up
to
oblige
others
advance
forward
undergoing
pain
kindness
nobleness
of
soul
certain
that
can
not
fail
to
show
plainly
communication
mutual
dealings
what
is
this
lesson
about
can
we
be
happy
without
friends
how
can
we
win
the
love
of
those
about
us
whose
fault
is
it
if
we
are
not
loved
what
rule
will
surely
gain
us
love
and
friendship
if
we
always
follow

the
giraffe
or
camelopard
the
giraffe
is
a
native
of
africa
it
is
of
singular
shape
and
size
and
bears
some
resemblance
both
to
the
camel
and
the
deer
the
mouth
is
small
the
eyes
are
full
and
brilliant
the
tongue
is
rough
very
long
and
ending
in
a
point
the
neck
is
long
and
slender
and
from
the
shoulder
to
the
top
of
the
head
it
measures
between
seven
and
eight
feet
from
the
ground
to
the
top
of
the
shoulder
it
is
commonly
ten
or
eleven
feet
so
that
the
height
of
a
giraffe
is
seventeen
or
eighteen
feet
the
hair
is
of
a
deep
brown
color
in
the
male
and
of
a
light
or
yellowish
brown
in
the
female
the
skin
is
beautifully
diversified
with
white
spots
they
have
short
blunt
horns
and
hoofs
like
those
of
the
ox
in
their
wild
state
they
feed
on
the
leaves
of
a
tree
peculiar
to
warm
climates
the
giraffe
like
the
horse
and
other
hoofed
animals
defends
itself
by
kicking
and
its
hinder
limbs
are
so
light
and
its
blows
so
rapid
that
the
eye
can
not
follow
them
they
are
sufficient
for
its
defense
against
the
lion
it
never
employs
its
horns
in
resisting
the
attack
of
an
enemy
its
disposition
is
gentle
and
it
flees
to
its
native
forest
upon
the
least
alarm
le
vaillant
the
celebrated
french
traveler
and
naturalist
was
the
first
who
gave
us
any
exact
account
of
the
form
and
habits
of
the
giraffe
while
he
was
traveling
in
south
africa
he
happened
one
day
to
discover
a
hut
covered
with
the
skin
of
one
of
those
animals
and
learned
to
his
surprise
that
he
was
now
in
a
part
of
the
country
where
the
creature
was
found
he
could
not
rest
contented
until
he
had
seen
the
animal
alive
and
had
secured
a
specimen
having
on
several
days
obtained
sight
of
some
of
them
he
with
his
attendants
on
horseback
and
accompanied
with
dogs
gave
chase
but
they
baffled
all
pursuit
after
a
chase
of
a
whole
day
which
effected
nothing
but
the
fatigue
of
the
party
he
began
to
despair
of
success
the
next
day
says
he
by
sunrise
i
was
in
pursuit
of
game
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
some
provisions
for
my
men
after
several
fatigue
we
saw
at
the
turn
of
a
hill
seven
giraffes
which
my
pack
of
dogs
instantly
pursued
six
of
them
went
off
together
but
the
seventh
cut
off
by
my
dogs
took
another
way
i
followed
the
single
one
at
full
speed
but
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
my
horse
she
got
so
much
ahead
of
me
that
in
turning
a
little
hill
i
lost
sight
of
her
altogether
and
i
gave
up
the
pursuit
my
dogs
however
were
not
so
easily
exhausted
they
were
soon
so
close
upon
her
that
she
was
obliged
to
stop
and
defend
herself
from
the
noise
they
made
i
conjectured
that
they
had
got
the
animal
into
a
corner
and
i
again
pushed
forward
i
had
scarcely
got
round
the
hill
when
i
perceived
her
surrounded
by
the
dogs
and
endeavoring
to
drive
them
away
by
heavy
kicks
in
a
moment
i
was
on
my
feet
and
a
shot
from
my
carbine
brought
her
to
the
earth
i
was
delighted
with
my
victory
which
enabled
me
to
add
to
the
riches
of
natural
history
i
was
now
able
also
to

to

the
lost
child
a
few
years
since
a
child
was
lost
in
the
woods
he
was
out
with
his
brothers
and
sisters
gathering
berries
and
was
accidentally
separated
from
them
and
lost
the
children
after
looking
in
vain
for
some
time
in
search
of
the
little
wanderer
returned
just
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
to
inform
their
parents
that
their
brother
was
lost
and
could
not
be
found
the
woods
at
that
time
were
full
of
bears
the
darkness
of
a
cloudy
night
was
rapidly
coming
on
and
the
alarmed
father
gathering
a
few
of
his
neighbors
hastened
in
search
of
the
lost
child
the
mother
remained
at
home
almost
distracted
with
suspense
as
the
clouds
gathered
and
the
darkness
increased
the
father
and
the
neighbors
with
highly
excited
fears
traversed
the
woods
in
all
directions
and
raised
loud
shouts
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
child
but
their
search
was
in
vain
they
could
find
no
trace
of
the
wanderer
and
as
they
stood
under
the
boughs
of
the
lofty
trees
and
listened
that
if
possible
they
might
hear
his
feeble
voice
no
sound
was
borne
to
their
ears
but
the
melancholy
moaning
of
the
wind
as
it
swept
through
the
thick
branches
of
the
forest
the
gathering
clouds
threatened
an
approaching
storm
and
the
deep
darkness
of
the
night
had
already
enveloped
them
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
what
were
the
feelings
of
that
father
and
who
could
imagine
how
deep
the
distress
which
filled
the
bosom
of
that
mother
as
she
heard
the
wind
and
beheld
the
darkness
in
which
her
child
was
wandering
the
search
was
continued
in
vain
till
nine
in
the
evening
then
one
of
the
party
was
sent
back
to
the
village
to
collect
the
inhabitants
for
a
more
extensive
search
the
bell
rung
the
alarm
and
the
cry
of
fire
resounded
through
the
streets
it
was
ascertained
however
that
it
was
not
fire
which
caused
the
alarm
but
that
the
bell
tolled
the
more
solemn
tidings
of
a
lost
child
every
heart
sympathized
in
the
sorrows
of
the
distracted
parents
soon
multitudes
of
the
people
were
seen
ascending
the
hill
upon
the
declivity
of
which
the
village
stood
to
aid
in
the
search
ere
long
the
rain
began
to
fall
but
no
tidings
came
back
to
the
village
of
the
lost
child
hardly
an
eye
was
that
night
closed
in
sleep
and
there
was
not
a
mother
who
did
not
feel
for
the
parents
the
night
passed
away
and
the
morning
dawned
and
yet
no
tidings
came
at
last
those
engaged
in
the
search
met
together
and
held
a
consultation
they
made
arrangements
for
a
more
minute
search
and
agreed
that
in
case
the
child
was
found
a
gun
should
be
fired
to
give
a
signal
to
the
rest
of
the
party
as
the
sun
arose
the
clouds
were
scattered
and
the
whole
landscape
glittered
in
the
rays
of
the
bright
morning
but
that
village
was
deserted
and
still
the
stores
were
closed
and
business
was
hushed
mothers
were
walking
the
streets
with
sympathizing
countenances
and
anxious
hearts
there
was
but
one
thought
in
every
mind
what
has
become
of
the
lost
child
all
the
affections
and
interest
of
the
neighborhood
were
flowing
in
one
deep
and
broad
channel
toward
the
little
wanderer
about
nine
in
the
morning
the
signal
gun
was
fired
which
announced
that
the
child
was
found
and
for
a
moment
how
dreadful
was
the
suspense
was
it
found
a
mangled
corpse
or
was
it
alive
and
well
soon
a
joyful
shout
proclaimed
the
safety
of
the
child
the
shout
was
borne
from
tongue
to
tongue
till
the
whole
forest
rang
again
with
the
joyful
sound
a
messenger
rapidly
bore
the
tidings
to
the
distracted
mother
a
procession
was
immediately
formed
by
those
engaged
in
the
search
the
child
was
placed
upon
a
platform
hastily
formed
from
the
boughs
of
trees
and
borne
in
triumph
at
the
head
of
the
procession
when
they
arrived
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
they
rested
for
a
moment
and
proclaimed
their
success
with
three
loud
and
animated
cheers
the
procession
then
moved
on
till
they
arrived
in
front
of
the
dwelling
where
the
parents
of
the
child
resided
the
mother
who
stood
at
the
door
with
streaming
eyes
and
throbbing
heart
could
no
longer
restrain
herself
or
her
feelings
she
rushed
into
the
street
clasped
her
child
to
her
bosom
and
wept
aloud
every
eye
was
filled
with
tears
and
for
a
moment
all
were
silent
but
suddenly
some
one
gave
a
signal
for
a
shout
one
loud
and
long
and
happy
note
of
joy
rose
from
the
assembled
multitude
and
they
went
to
their
business
and
their
homes
there
was
more
joy
over
the
one
child
that
was
found
than
over
the
ninety
and
nine
that
went
not
astray
likewise
there
is
joy
in
the
presence
of
the
angels
of
god
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
but
still
this
is
a
feeble
representation
of
the
love
of
our
father
in
heaven
for
us
and
of
the
joy
with
which
the
angels
welcome
the
returning
wanderer
the
mother
can
not
feel
for
her
child
that
is
lost
as
god
feels
for
the
unhappy
wanderer
in
the
paths
of
sin
if
a
mother
can
feel
so
much
what
must
be
the
feelings
of
our
father
in
heaven
for
those
who
have
strayed
from
his
love
if
man
can
feel
so
deep
a
sympathy
what
must
be
the
emotions
which
glow
in
the
bosom
of
angels
l

crazy

john
looked
at
me
dear
patient
john
who
loves
me
yet
as
well
as
though
my
locks
were
jet
and
when
i
found
that
i
must
speak
my
voice
seemed
strangely
low
and
weak
tell
me
again
what
robert
said
and
then
i
listening
bent
my
head
this
is
his
letter

give

while
you
shall
live
if
in

from

your

i
looked
at
john
old
garments
worn
i
thought
of
all
that
john
had
borne
of
poverty
and
work
and
care
which
i
though
willing
could
not
share
i
thought
of
seven
mouths
to
feed
of
seven
little
children
need
and
then
of
this
come
john
said
i
we
choose
among
them
as
they
lie
asleep
so
walking
hand
in
hand
dear
john
and
i
surveyed
our
band
first
to
the
cradle
light
we
stepped
where
lilian
the
baby
slept
a
glory
the
pillow
white
softly
the
father
stooped
to
lay
his
rough
hand
down
in
loving
way
when
dream
or
whisper
made
her
stir
and
huskily
he
said
not
her
we
stooped
beside
the
and
one
long
ray
of
lamplight
shed
athwart
the
boyish
faces
there
in
sleep
so
pitiful
and
fair
i
saw
on
jamie
rough
red
cheek
a
tear
undried
ere
john
could
speak
he
but
a
baby
too
said
i
and
kissed
him
as
we
hurried
by

in

were

poor

our
wayward

could
he
be

nay
he
who

him
to

grave
only
a

heart
can
be
patient
enough
for
such

he
and
so
said
john
i
would
not
dare
to
send
him
from
her
bedside

then
stole
we
softly
up
above
and
knelt
by
mary
child
of
love
perhaps
for
her

better
be
i
said
to
john
quite
silently
he
lifted
up
a
curl
that
lay
across
her
cheek
in
willful
way
and
shook
his
head
nay

the
while
my

no
john
no

can
not
will
not
let

so
we
wrote
in
courteous
way
we
could
not
drive
one
child
away
and
afterward
toil
lighter
seemed
thinking
of
that
of
which
we
dreamed

in

not

missed

lxiii
the
pet
fawn
a
pretty
little
fawn
had
been
brought
in
from
the
woods
when
very
young
and
nursed
and
petted
by
a
lady
in
the
village
until
it
had
become
as
tame
as
possible
it
was
graceful
as
those
little
creatures
always
are
and
so
gentle
and
playful
that
it
became
a
great
favorite
following
the
different
members
of
the
family
about
being
caressed
by
the
neighbors
and
welcome
everywhere
one
morning
after
playing
about
as
usual
until
weary
it
lay
down
in
the
sunshine
at
the
feet
of
one
of
its
friends
upon
the
steps
of
a
store
there
came
along
a
countryman
who
for
several
years
had
been
a
hunter
by
pursuit
and
who
still
kept
several
hounds
one
of
which
was
now
with
him
the
dog
as
it
approached
the
spot
where
the
fawn
lay
suddenly
stopped
the
little
animal
saw
him
and
started
to
its
feet
it
had
lived
more
than
half
its
life
among
the
dogs
of
the
village
and
had
apparently
lost
all
fear
of
them
but
it
seemed
now
to
know
that
an
enemy
was
near
in
an
instant
its
whole
nature
seemed
changed
all
its
past
habits
were
forgotten
every
wild
impulse
was
awake
its
head
erect
its
nostrils
dilated
its
eyes
flashing
in
another
instant
before
the
spectators
had
thought
of
the
danger
and
before
its
friends
could
secure
it
the
fawn
was
bounding
away
through
the
street
and
the
hound
in
full
chase
the
bystanders
were
eager
to
save
it
several
persons
immediately
followed
its
track
the
friends
who
had
long
fed
and
fondled
it
calling
the
name
it
had
hitherto
known
in
vain
the
hunter
endeavored
to
whistle
back
his
dog
but
with
no
success
in
half
a
minute
the
fawn
had
turned
the
first
corner
dashed
onward
toward
the
lake
and
thrown
itself
into
the
water
but
if
for
a
moment
the
startled
creature
believed
itself
safe
in
the
cool
bosom
of
the
lake
it
was
soon
undeceived
for
the
hound
followed
in
hot
and
eager
chase
while
a
dozen
village
dogs
joined
blindly
in
the
pursuit
a
large
crowd
collected
on
the
bank
men
women
and
children
anxious
for
the
fate
of
the
little
animal
so
well
known
to
them
all
some
threw
themselves
into
boats
hoping
to
intercept
the
hound
before
he
reached
his
prey
the
plashing
of
the
oars
the
eager
voices
of
men
and
boys
and
the
barking
of
the
dogs
must
have
filled
the
heart
of
the
poor
fawn
with
terror
and
anguish
as
though
every
creature
on
the
spot
where
it
had
once
been
caressed
and
fondled
had
suddenly
turned
into
a
deadly
foe
it
was
soon
seen
that
the
little
animal
was
directing
its
course
across
a
bay
toward
the
nearest
borders
of
the
forest
immediately
the
owner
of
the
hound
crossed
the
bridge
and
ran
at
full
speed
hoping
to
stop
his
dog
as
he
landed
on
swam
the
fawn
as
it
never
swam
before
its
delicate
head
scarcely
seen
above
the
water
but
leaving
a
disturbed
track
which
betrayed
its
course
alike
to
its
friends
and
foes
as
it
approached
the
land
the
interest
became
intense
the
hunter
was
already
on
the
same
side
of
the
lake
calling
loudly
and
angrily
to
his
dog
but
the
hound
seemed
to
have
quite
forgotten
his
master
voice
in
the
pitiless
pursuit
the
fawn
reached
the
shore
with
a
leap
it
had
crossed
the
narrow
strip
of
beach
and
in
another
instant
it
would
reach
the
cover
of
the
woods
the
hound
followed
true
to
the
scent
pointing
to
the
same
spot
on
the
shore
his
master
anxious
to
meet
him
had
run
at
full
speed
and
was
now
coming
up
at
the
same
critical
moment
will
the
dog
listen
to
his
voice
or
can
the
hunter
reach
him
in
time
to
seize
and
control
him
a
shout
from
the
bank
told
that
the
fawn
had
passed
out
of
sight
into
the
forest
at
the
same
instant
the
hound
as
he
touched
the
land
felt
the
strong
arm
clutching
his
neck
the
worst
was
believed
to
be
over
the
fawn
was
leaping
up
the
mountain
side
and
its
enemy
was
restrained
the
other
dogs
seeing
their
leader
cowed
were
easily
managed
a
number
of
persons
men
and
boys
dispersed
themselves
through
the
woods
in
search
of
the
little
creature
but
without
success
they
all
returned
to
the
village
reporting
that
the
fawn
had
not
been
seen
some
thought
that
after
its
fright
had
passed
it
would
return
of
its
own
accord
it
wore
a
pretty
collar
with
its
owner
name
engraved
upon
it
so
that
it
could
be
easily
known
from
any
other
fawn
that
might
be
straying
about
the
woods
before
many
hours
had
passed
a
hunter
presented
himself
to
the
lady
whose
pet
the
little
creature
had
been
and
showed
a
collar
with
her
name
upon
it
he
said
that
he
was
out
hunting
in
the
morning
and
saw
a
fawn
in
the
distance
the
little
pet
instead
of
bounding
away
as
he
expected
moved
toward
him
he
took
aim
fired
and
shot
it
through
the
heart

lxiv
annie
dream
it
was
a
clear
cold
winter
evening
and
all
the
sinclairs
but
annie
had
gone
out
for
a
neighborly
visit
she
had
resolved
to
stay
at
home
and
study
a
long
difficult
lesson
in
natural
philosophy
left
to
herself
the
evening
passed
quickly
but
the
lesson
was
learned
a
full
half
hour
before
the
time
set
for
the
family
to
come
home
closing
her
book
she
leaned
back
in
the
soft
armchair
in
which
she
was
sitting
soon
fell
asleep
and
began
to
dream
she
dreamed
that
it
was
a
very
cold
morning
and
that
she
was
standing
by
the
stove
looking
into
the
glass
basin
which
was
every
day
filled
with
water
for
evaporation
oh
dear
she
sighed
it
is
nearly
school
time
i
do
want
to
go
out
in
the
cold
this
morning
then
there
is
that
long
lesson
i
wonder
if
i
can
say
it
let
me
see
it
takes
two
hundred
and
twelve
degrees
of
heat
i
believe
for
water
to
evaporate
nonsense
ridiculous
shouted
a
chorus
of
strange
little
voices
near
by
look
here
is
this
water
boiling
what
an
idea
two
hundred
and
twelve
degrees
before
we
can
fly
ha
ha
who
are
you
asked
annie
in
amazement
where
must
i
look
in
the
basin
of
course
annie
looked
and
saw
a
multitude
of
tiny
forms
moving
swiftly
around
their
numbers
increasing
as
the
heat
of
the
fire
increased
why
you
dear
little
things
said
she
what
are
you
doing
down
there
we
are
water
sprites
answered
one
in
the
clearest
voice
that
can
be
imagined
and
when
this
delightful
warmth
comes
all
about
us
we
become
so
light
that
we
fly
off
as
you
see
in
another
moment
he
had
joined
a
crowd
of
his
companions
that
were
spreading
their
wings
and
flying
off
in
curling
white
clouds
over
head
but
they
were
so
light
and
thin
that
they
soon
disappeared
in
the
air
she
could
not
see
where
they
went
so
she
again
turned
to
the
basin
does
it
hurt
you
she
asked
one
to
be
heated
not
always
to
two
hundred
and
twelve
said
the
sprite
mischievously
no
no
replied
annie
i
remember
that
is
boiling
point
but
i
mean
to
be
heated
as
you
all
are
and
then
to
fly
off
in
the
cold
oh
no
laughed
the
little
sprite
we
like
it
we
are
made
to
change
by
god
wise
laws
and
so
it
ca
hurt
us
we
are
all
the
time
at
work
in
our
way
taking
different
shapes
it
is
good
for
us
if
you
will
go
to
the
window
you
will
find
some
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
on
the
glass
annie
went
to
the
window
and
at
first
could
see
nothing
but
some
beautiful
frostwork
on
it
soon
however
the
panes
seemed
to
swarm
with
little
folks
their
wings
were
as
white
as
snow
and
sparkled
with
ice
jewels
oh
cried
annie
this
is
the
prettiest
sight
i
ever
saw
what
is
your
name
darling
she
asked
one
that
wore
a
crown
of
snow
roses
the
little
voice
that
replied
was
so
sharp
and
fine
that
annie
thought
it
seemed
like
a
needle
point
of
sound
and
she
began
to
laugh
fine
frost
is
our
family
name
it
said
i
have
a
first
name
of
my
own
but
i
shall
not
tell
you
what
it
is
for
you
are
so
impolite
as
to
laugh
at
me
i
beg
your
pardon
dear
said
annie
i
could
not
help
it
i
will
not
laugh
at
you
any
more
if
you
will
tell
me
how
you
came
here
i
have
been
talking
with
one
of
your
brothers
over
there
in
the
basin
the
little
sprite
then
folded
her
wings
in
a
dignified
manner
and
said
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
about
it
since
you
promise
to
be
polite
it
is
a
very
short
story
however
last
evening
we
all
escaped
from
the
glass
basin
as
you
have
seen
our
companions
do
this
morning
oh
how
light
and
free
we
felt
but
we
were
so
very
delicate
and
thin
that
no
one
saw
us
as
we
flew
about
in
the
air
of
the
room
after
a
while
i
flew
with
these
others
to
this
window
and
as
we
alighted
on
the
glass
the
cold
changed
us
from
water
sprites
into
sprites
of
the
fine
frost
family
it
is
very
wonderful
said
annie
is
it
nice
to
be
a
sprite
oh
yes
we
are
very
gay
all
last
night
we
had
a
fine
time
sparkling
in
the
moonlight
i
wore
a
long
wreath
full
of
ice
pearls
and
diamonds
here
is
a
piece
of
it
before
long
we
shall
be
water
sprites
again
i
see
the
sun
is
coming
this
way
shall
you
dread
to
be
melted
inquired
annie
no
indeed
answered
the
sprite
i
like
to
change
my
form
now
and
then
a
thought
flashed
across
annie
brain
what
if
she
should
breathe
on
the
frost
and
not
wait
for
the
sun
to
melt
it
in
a
moment
more
she
had
done
so
down
fell
a
great
number
of
the
tiny
mountains
and
castles
carrying
with
them
a
multitude
of
frost
sprites
and
all
that
could
be
seen
was
a
drop
of
water
on
the
window
sill
oh
dear
have
i
hurt
them
she
exclaimed
no
no
replied
a
chorus
of
many
small
voices
from
the
drop
of
water
we
are
only
water
sprites
again
nothing
hurts
us
we
merely
change
but
you
are
always
pretty
little
things
said
annie
i
wish
here
a
ring
at
the
doorbell
woke
annie
she
started
up
to
find
the
family
had
returned
from
their
visit
which
all
declared
was
a
delightful
one
but
annie
said
she
did
not
believe
they
had
enjoyed
their
visit
better
than
she
had
her
half
hour
dream
the
study
which
teaches
about
the
laws
of
matter
in
nature
the
act
of
turning
into
vapor
a
division
of
space
marked
on
an
instrument
such
as

thermometer

my
ghost
by
piatt
who
was
born
near
lexington
in
among
her
published
works
may
be
mentioned
the
nests
at
washington
and
other
poems
and
a
woman
poems
yes
katie
i
think
you
are
very
sweet
now
that
the
tangles
are
out
of
your
hair
and
you
sing
as
well
as
the
birds
you
meet
that
are
playing
like
you
in
the
blossoms
there
but
now
you
are
coming
to
kiss
me
you
say
well
what
is
it
for
shall
i
tie
your
shoe
or
loop
up
your
sleeve
in
a
prettier
way
do
i
know
about
ghosts
indeed
i
do
have
i
seen
one
yes
last
evening
you
know
we
were
taking
a
walk
that
you
had
to
miss
i
think
you
were
naughty
and
cried
to
go
but
surely
you
stay
at
home
after
this
and
away
in
the
twilight
lonesomely
what
is
the
twilight
it
getting
late
i
was
thinking
of
things
that
were
sad
to
me
there
hush
you
know
nothing
about
them
kate
well
we
had
to
go
through
the
rocky
lane
close
to
that
bridge
where
the
water
roars
by
a
still
red
house
where
the
dark
and
rain
go
in
when
they
will
at
the
open
doors
and
the
moon
that
had
just
waked
up
looked
through
the
broken
old
windows
and
seemed
afraid
and
the
wild
bats
flew
and
the
thistles
grew
where
once
in
the
roses
the
children
played
just
across
the
road
by
the
cherry
trees
some
fallen
white
stones
had
been
lying
so
long
half
hid
in
the
grass
and
under
these
there
were
people
dead
i
could
hear
the
song
of
a
very
sleepy
dove
as
i
passed
the
graveyard
near
and
the
cricket
that
cried
and
i
look
ah
the
ghost
is
coming
at
last
and
something
was
walking
at
my
side
it
seemed
to
be
wrapped
in
a
great
dark
shawl
for
the
night
was
a
little
cold
you
know
it
would
not
speak
it
was
black
and
tall
and
it
walked
so
proudly
and
very
slow
then
it
mocked
me
everything
i
could
do
now
it
caught
at
the
lightning
flies
like
me
now
it
stopped
where
the
elder
blossoms
grew
now
it
tore
the
thorns
from
a
gray
bent
tree
still
it
followed
me
under
the
yellow
moon
looking
back
to
the
graveyard
now
and
then
where
the
winds
were
playing
the
night
a
tune
but
kate
a
ghost
does
care
for
men
and
your
papa
could
have
done
it
harm
ah
darling
what
is
it
you
see
there
you
need
hide
in
your
dimpled
arm
it
was
only
my
shadow

the
elephant
the
elephant
is
the
largest
of
quadrupeds
his
height
is
from
eight
to
fourteen
feet
and
his
length
from
ten
to
fifteen
feet
his
form
is
that
of
a
hog
his
eyes
are
small
and
lively
his
ears
are
long
broad
and
pendulous
he
has
two
large
tusks
which
form
the
ivory
of
commerce
and
a
trunk
or
proboscis
at
the
end
of
the
nose
which
he
uses
to
take
his
food
with
and
for
attack
or
defense
his
color
is
a
dark
elephants
often
assemble
in
large
troops
and
as
they
march
in
search
of
food
the
forests
seem
to
tremble
under
them
they
eat
the
branches
of
trees
together
with
roots
herbs
leaves
grain
and
fruit
but
will
not
touch
fish
nor
flesh
in
a
state
of
nature
they
are
peaceable
mild
and
brave
exerting
their
power
only
for
their
own
protection
or
in
defense
of
their
own
species
elephants
are
found
both
in
asia
and
africa
but
they
are
of
different
species
the
asiatic
elephant
having
five
toes
and
the
african
three
these
animals
are
caught
by
stratagem
and
when
tamed
they
are
the
most
gentle
obedient
and
patient
as
well
as
the
most
docile
and
sagacious
of
all
quadrupeds
they
are
used
to
carry
burdens
and
for
traveling
their
attachment
to
their
masters
is
remarkable
and
they
seem
to
live
but
to
serve
and
obey
them
they
always
kneel
to
receive
their
riders
or
the
loads
they
have
to
carry
the
anecdotes
illustrating
the
character
of
the
elephant
are
numerous
an
elephant
which
was
kept
for
exhibition
at
london
was
often
required
as
is
usual
in
such
exhibitions
to
pick
up
with
his
trunk
a
piece
of
money
thrown
upon
the
floor
for
this
purpose
on
one
occasion
a
sixpence
was
thrown
which
happened
to
roll
a
little
out
of
his
reach
not
far
from
the
wall
being
desired
to
pick
it
up
he
stretched
out
his
proboscis
several
times
to
reach
it
failing
in
this
he
stood
motionless
a
few
seconds
evidently
considering
how
to
act
he
then
stretched
his
proboscis
in
a
straight
line
as
far
as
he
could
a
little
distance
above
the
coin
and
blew
with
great
force
against
the
wall
the
angle
produced
by
the
opposition
of
the
wall
made
the
current
of
air
act
under
the
coin
as
he
evidently
supposed
it
would
and
it
was
curious
to
observe
the
sixpence
traveling
toward
the
animal
till
it
came
within
his
reach
when
he
picked
it
up
a
soldier
in
india
who
had
frequently
carried
an
elephant
some
arrack
being
one
day
intoxicated
and
seeing
himself
pursued
by
the
guard
whose
orders
were
to
conduct
him
to
prison
took
refuge
under
the
elephant
the
guard
soon
finding
his
retreat
attempted
in
vain
to
take
him
from
his
asylum
for
the
elephant
vigorously
defended
him
with
his
trunk
as
soon
as
the
soldier
became
sober
and
saw
himself
placed
under
such
an
unwieldy
animal
he
was
so
terrified
that
he
scarcely
durst
move
either
hand
or
foot
but
the
elephant
soon
caused
his
fears
to
subside
by
caressing
him
with
his
trunk
and
thus
tacitly
saying
depart
in
peace
a
pleasing
anecdote
is
related
of
an
elephant
which
was
the
property
of
the
nabob
of
lucknow
there
was
in
that
city
an
epidemic
disorder
making
dreadful
havoc
among
the
inhabitants
the
road
to
the
palace
gate
was
covered
with
the
sick
and
dying
lying
on
the
ground
at
the
moment
the
nabob
was
about
to
pass
regardless
of
the
suffering
he
must
cause
the
nabob
held
on
his
way
not
caring
whether
his
beast
trod
upon
the
poor
helpless
creatures
or
not
but
the
animal
more
than
his
master
carefully
cleared
the
path
of
the
poor
helpless
wretches
as
he
went
along
some
he
lifted
with
his
trunk
entirely
out
of
the
road
some
he
set
upon
their
feet
and
among
the
others
he
stepped

lxvii
dare
to
do
right
adapted
from
school
days
at
rugby
by
thomas
hughes
an
english
writer
well
known
through
this
book
and
its
sequel
tom
brown
at
oxford
the
author
was
born
in
and
died
in
the
little
schoolboys
went
quietly
to
their
own
beds
and
began
undressing
and
talking
to
one
another
in
whispers
while
the
elder
amongst
whom
was
tom
sat
chatting
about
on
one
another
beds
with
their
jackets
and
waistcoats
off
poor
little
arthur
was
overwhelmed
with
the
novelty
of
his
position
the
idea
of
sleeping
in
the
room
with
strange
boys
had
clearly
never
crossed
his
mind
before
and
was
as
painful
as
it
was
strange
to
him
he
could
hardly
bear
to
take
his
jacket
off
however
presently
with
an
effort
off
it
came
and
then
he
paused
and
looked
at
tom
who
was
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
his
bed
talking
and
laughing
please
brown
he
whispered
may
i
wash
my
face
and
hands
of
course
if
you
like
said
tom
staring
that
your
stand
under
the
window
second
from
your
bed
you
have
to
go
down
for
more
water
in
the
morning
if
you
use
it
all
and
on
he
went
with
his
talk
while
arthur
stole
timidly
from
between
the
beds
out
to
his
stand
and
began
his
ablutions
thereby
drawing
for
a
moment
on
himself
the
attention
of
the
room
on
went
the
talk
and
laughter
arthur
finished
his
washing
and
undressing
and
put
on
his
nightgown
he
then
looked
round
more
nervously
than
ever
two
or
three
of
the
little
boys
were
already
in
bed
sitting
up
with
their
chins
on
their
knees
the
light
burned
clear
the
noise
went
on
it
was
a
trying
moment
for
the
poor
little
lonely
boy
however
this
time
he
did
not
ask
tom
what
he
might
or
might
not
do
but
dropped
all
his
knees
by
his
bedside
as
he
had
done
every
day
from
his
childhood
to
open
his
heart
to
him
who
heareth
the
cry
and
beareth
the
sorrows
of
the
tender
child
and
the
strong
man
in
agony
tom
was
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
his
bed
unlacing
his
boots
so
that
his
back
was
towards
arthur
and
he
did
not
see
what
had
happened
and
looked
up
in
wonder
at
the
sudden
silence
then
two
or
three
boys
laughed
and
sneered
and
a
big
brutal
fellow
who
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
picked
up
a
slipper
and
shied
it
at
the
kneeling
boy
calling
him
a
sniveling
young
shaver
then
tom
saw
the
whole
and
the
next
moment
the
boot
he
had
just
pulled
off
flew
straight
at
the
head
of
the
bully
who
had
just
time
to
throw
up
his
arm
and
catch
it
on
his
elbow
confound
you
brown
what
that
for
roared
he
stamping
with
pain
never
mind
what
i
mean
said
tom
stepping
on
to
the
floor
every
drop
of
blood
in
his
body
tingling
if
any
fellow
wants
the
other
boot
he
knows
how
to
get
it
what
would
have
been
the
result
is
doubtful
for
at
this
moment
the
boy
came
in
and
not
another
word
could
be
said
tom
and
the
rest
rushed
into
bed
and
finished
their
unrobing
there
and
the
old
janitor
had
put
out
the
candle
in
another
minute
and
toddled
on
to
the
next
room
shutting
the
door
with
his
usual
good
night
there
were
many
boys
in
the
room
by
whom
that
little
scene
was
taken
to
heart
before
they
slept
but
sleep
seemed
to
have
deserted
the
pillow
of
poor
tom
for
some
time
his
excitement
and
the
flood
of
memories
which
chased
one
another
though
his
brain
kept
him
from
thinking
or
resolving
his
head
throbbed
his
heart
leapt
and
he
could
hardly
keep
himself
from
springing
out
of
bed
and
rushing
about
the
room
then
the
thought
of
his
own
mother
came
across
him
and
the
promise
he
had
made
at
her
knee
years
ago
never
to
forget
to
kneel
by
his
bedside
and
give
himself
up
to
his
father
before
he
laid
his
head
on
the
pillow
from
which
it
might
never
rise
and
he
lay
down
gently
and
cried
as
if
his
heart
would
break
he
was
only
fourteen
years
old
l
a
vest
cast
down
newness
the
act
of
washing
sneered
showed
contempt
a
noisy
blustering
fellow
more
insolent
than
courageous
having
a
thrilling
feeling
rugby
the
scene
of
this
story
is
a
celebrated
grammar
school
which
was
established
at
the
town
of
rugby
england
in
boy
the
school
was
graded
into
six
classes
or
forms
and
the
boys
of
the
highest
or
sixth
form
were
expected
to
keep
the
smaller
boys
under
them
in
order
what
were
arthur
feelings
the
first
night
at
rugby
relate
what
happened
when
he
said
his
prayers
what
do
you
think
of
the
boy
who
threw
the
slipper
was
tom
right
in
defending
arthur
from
insult
lxviii
dare
to
do
right
concluded
it
was
no
light
act
of
courage
in
those
days
for
a
little
fellow
to
say
his
prayers
publicly
even
at
rugby
a
few
years
later
when
manly
piety
had
begun
to
leaven
the
school
the
tables
turned
before
he
died
in
the
schoolhouse
at
least
and
i
believe
in
the
other
houses
the
rule
was
the
other
way
but
poor
tom
had
come
to
school
in
other
times
the
first
few
nights
after
he
came
he
did
not
kneel
down
because
of
the
noise
but
sat
up
in
bed
till
the
candle
was
out
and
then
stole
out
and
said
his
prayers
in
fear
lest
some
one
should
find
him
out
so
did
many
another
poor
little
fellow
then
he
began
to
think
that
he
might
just
as
well
say
his
prayers
in
bed
and
then
that
it
did
not
matter
whether
he
was
kneeling
or
sitting
or
lying
down
and
so
it
had
come
to
pass
with
tom
as
with
all
who
will
not
confess
their
lord
before
men
and
for
the
last
year
he
had
probably
not
said
his
prayers
in
earnest
a
dozen
times
poor
tom
the
first
and
bitterest
feeling
which
was
like
to
break
his
heart
was
the
sense
of
his
own
cowardice
the
vice
of
all
others
which
he
loathed
was
brought
in
and
burned
in
on
his
own
soul
he
had
lied
to
his
mother
to
his
conscience
to
his
god
how
could
he
bear
it
and
then
the
poor
little
weak
boy
whom
he
had
pitied
and
almost
scorned
for
his
weakness
had
done
that
which
he
braggart
as
he
was
dared
not
do
the
first
dawn
of
comfort
came
to
him
in
vowing
to
himself
that
he
would
stand
by
that
boy
through
thick
and
thin
and
cheer
him
and
help
him
and
bear
his
burdens
for
the
good
deed
done
that
night
then
he
resolved
to
write
home
next
day
and
tell
his
mother
all
and
what
a
coward
her
son
had
been
and
then
peace
came
to
him
as
he
resolved
lastly
to
bear
his
testimony
next
morning
the
morning
would
be
harder
than
the
night
to
begin
with
but
he
felt
that
he
could
not
afford
to
let
one
chance
slip
several
times
he
faltered
for
the
devil
showed
him
first
all
his
old
friends
calling
him
saint
and
squaretoes
and
a
dozen
hard
names
and
whispered
to
him
that
his
motives
would
be
misunderstood
and
he
would
be
left
alone
with
the
new
boy
whereas
it
was
his
duty
to
keep
all
means
of
influence
that
he
might
do
good
to
the
largest
number
and
then
came
the
more
subtle
temptation
shall
i
not
be
showing
myself
braver
than
others
by
doing
this
have
i
any
right
to
begin
it
now
ought
i
not
rather
to
pray
in
my
own
study
letting
other
boys
know
that
i
do
so
and
trying
to
lead
them
to
it
while
in
public
at
least
i
should
go
on
as
i
have
done
however
his
good
angel
was
too
strong
that
night
and
he
turned
on
his
side
and
slept
tired
of
trying
to
reason
but
resolved
to
follow
the
impulse
which
had
been
so
strong
and
in
which
he
had
found
peace
next
morning
he
was
up
and
washed
and
dressed
all
but
his
jacket
and
waistcoat
just
as
the
ten
minutes
bell
began
to
ring
and
then
in
the
face
of
the
whole
room
he
knelt
down
to
pray
not
five
words
could
he
say
the
bell
mocked
him
he
was
listening
for
every
whisper
in
the
room
what
were
they
all
thinking
of
him
he
was
ashamed
to
go
on
kneeling
ashamed
to
rise
from
his
knees
at
last
as
it
were
from
his
inmost
heart
a
still
small
voice
seemed
to
breathe
forth
the
words
of
the
publican
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
he
repeated
them
over
and
over
clinging
to
them
as
for
his
life
and
rose
from
his
knees
comforted
and
humbled
and
ready
to
face
the
whole
world
it
was
not
needed
two
other
boys
besides
arthur
had
already
followed
his
example
and
he
went
down
to
the
great
school
with
a
glimmering
of
another
lesson
in
his
heart
the
lesson
that
he
who
has
conquered
his
own
coward
spirit
has
conquered
the
whole
outward
world
and
that
other
one
which
the
old
prophet
learned
in
the
cave
at
mount
horeb
when
he
hid
his
face
and
the
still
small
voice
asked

anecdotes
of
birds
i
had
once
a
favorite
black
hen
a
great
beauty
as
she
was
called
by
everyone
and
so
i
thought
her
her
feathers
were
so
jetty
and
her
topping
so
white
and
full
she
knew
my
voice
as
well
as
any
dog
and
used
to
run
cackling
and
bustling
to
my
hand
to
receive
the
fragments
that
i
never
failed
to
collect
from
the
breakfast
table
for
yarico
as
she
was
called
yarico
by
the
time
she
was
a
year
old
hatched
a
respectable
family
of
chickens
little
cowering
timid
things
at
first
but
in
due
time
they
became
fine
chubby
ones
and
old
norah
said
if
i
could
only
keep
yarico
out
of
the
copse
it
would
do
but
the
copse
is
full
of
weasels
and
of
foxes
i
have
driven
her
back
twenty
times
but
she
watches
till
some
one
goes
out
of
the
gate
and
then
she
off
again
it
is
always
the
case
with
young
hens
miss
they
think
they
know
better
than
their
keepers
and
nothing
cures
them
but
losing
a
brood
or
two
of
chickens
i
have
often
thought
since
that
young
people
as
well
as
young
hens
buy
their
experience
equally
dear
one
morning
after
breakfast
i
went
to
seek
my
favorite
in
the
poultry
yard
plenty
of
hens
were
there
but
no
yarico
the
gate
was
open
and
as
i
concluded
she
had
sought
the
forbidden
copse
i
proceeded
there
accompanied
by
the
yard
mastiff
a
noble
fellow
steady
and
sagacious
as
a
judge
at
the
end
of
a
lane
flanked
on
one
side
by
a
quickset
hedge
on
the
other
by
a
wild
common
what
was
called
the
copse
commenced
but
before
i
arrived
near
the
spot
i
heard
a
loud
and
tremendous
cackling
and
met
two
young
pullets
running
with
both
wings
and
feet
toward
home
jock
pricked
up
his
sharp
ears
and
would
have
set
off
at
full
gallop
to
the
copse
but
i
restrained
him
hastening
onward
however
at
the
top
of
my
speed
thinking
i
had
as
good
a
right
to
see
what
was
the
matter
as
jock
poor
yarico
an
impertinent
fox
cub
had
attempted
to
carry
off
one
of
her
children
but
she
had
managed
to
get
them
behind
her
in
the
hedge
and
venturing
boldly
forth
had
placed
herself
in
front
and
positively
kept
the
impudent
animal
at
bay
his
desire
for
plunder
had
prevented
his
noticing
our
approach
and
jock
soon
made
him
feel
the
superiority
of
an
english
mastiff
over
a
cub
fox
the
most
interesting
portion
of
my
tale
is
to
come
yarico
not
only
never
afterward
ventured
to
the
copse
but
formed
a
strong
friendship
for
the
dog
which
had
preserved
her
family
whenever
he
appeared
in
the
yard
she
would
run
to
meet
him
prating
and
clucking
all
the
time
and
impeding
his
progress
by
walking
between
his
legs
to
his
no
small
annoyance
if
any
other
dog
entered
the
yard
she
would
fly
at
him
most
furiously
thinking
perhaps
that
he
would
injure
her
chickens
but
she
evidently
considered
jock
her
especial
protector
and
treated
him
accordingly
it
was
very
droll
to
see
the
peculiar
look
with
which
he
regarded
his
feathered
friend
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
make
of
her
civilities
and
doubting
how
they
should
be
received
when
her
family
were
educated
and
able
to
do
without
her
care
she
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
jock
kennel
and
would
if
permitted
roost
there
at
night
instead
of
returning
with
the
rest
of
the
poultry
to
the
henhouse
yarico
certainly
was
a
most
grateful
and
interesting
bird
one
could
almost
believe
a
parrot
had
intellect
when
he
keeps
up
a
conversation
so
spiritedly
and
it
is
certainly
singular
to
observe
how
accurately
a
bird
will
apply
his
knowledge
a
friend
of
mine
knew
one
that
had
been
taught
many
sentences

always

was
a
most
amusing
bird
and
could
whistle
dogs
which
she
had
great
pleasure
in
doing
she
would
drop
bread
out
of
her
cage
as
she
hung
at
the
street
door
and
whistle
a
number
about
her
and
then
just
as
they
were
going
to
possess
themselves
of
her
bounty
utter
a
shrill
scream
of
get
out
dogs
with
such
vehemence
and
authority
as
dispersed
the
assembled
company
without
a
morsel
to
her
infinite
delight
how
wonderful
is
that
instinct
by
which
the
bird
of
passage
performs
its
annual
migration
but
how
still
more
wonderful
is
it
when
the
bird
after
its
voyage
of
thousands
of
miles
has
been
performed
and
new
lands
visited
returns
to
the
precise
window
or
eaves
where
the
summer
before
it
first
enjoyed
existence
and
yet
such
is
unquestionably
the
fact
four
brothers
had
watched
with
indignation
the
felonious
attempts
of
a
sparrow
to
possess
himself
of
the
nest
of
a
house
martin
in
which
lay
its
young
brood
of
four
unfledged
birds
the
little
fellows
considered
themselves
as
champions
for
the
bird
which
had
come
over
land
and
sea
and
chosen
its
shelter
under
their
mother
roof
they
therefore
marshaled
themselves
with
blowguns
to
execute
summary
vengeance
but
their
endeavors
brought
destruction
upon
the
domicile

wished
to
defend

artillery

down
it

little

the
little
outcasts
in
their
nest
and

unoccupied
chamber

parent
birds
after
the
first
terror
was
over
did
not
appear
disconcerted
by
the
change
of
situation
but
hourly
fed
their
young
as
usual
and
testified
by
their
unwearied
twitter
of
pleasure
the
satisfaction
and
confidence
they
felt
there
the
young
birds
were
duly
fledged
and
from
that
window
they
began
their
flight
and
entered
upon
life
the
next
spring
with
the
reappearance
of
the
martins
came
four
which
familiarly
flew
into
the
chamber
visited
all
the
walls
and
expressed
their
recognition
by
the
most
clamorous
twitterings

brother
rufus
who
was
just
recovering
from
a
severe
illness
and
was
sitting
propped
up
with
pillows
in
an
looking
out
with
me
at
the
rainbow
see
brother
i
said
it
drops
right
down
among
the
cedars
where
we
go
in
the
spring
to
find
wintergreens
do
you
know
gracie
said
my
brother
with
a
very
serious
face
that
if
you
should
go
to
the
end
of
the
rain
how
you
would
find
there
purses
filled
with
money
and
great
pots
of
gold
and
silver
is
it
truly
so
i
asked
truly
so
answered
my
brother
with
a
smile
now
i
was
a
child
who
believed
everything
that
was
told
me
although
i
was
again
and
again
imposed
upon
so
without
another
word
i
darted
out
of
the
door
and
set
forth
toward
the
wood
my
brother
called
after
me
as
loudly
as
he
was
able
but
i
did
not
heed
him
i
cared
nothing
for
the
wet
grass
which
was
sadly
drabbling
my
clean
frock
on
and
on
i
ran
i
was
so
sure
that
i
knew
just
where
that
rainbow
ended
i
remember
how
glad
and
proud
i
was
in
my
thoughts
and
what
fine
presents
i
promised
to
all
my
friends
out
of
my
great
riches
so
thinking
and
laying
delightful
plans
almost
before
i
knew
it
i
had
reached
the
cedar
grove
and
the
end
of
the
rainbow
was
not
there
but
i
saw
it
shining
down
among
the
trees
a
little
farther
off
so
on
and
on
i
struggled
through
the
thick
bushes
and
over
logs
till
i
came
within
the
sound
of
a
stream
which
ran
through
the
swamp
then
i
thought
what
if
the
rainbow
should
come
down
right
in
the
middle
of
that
deep
muddy
brook
ah
but
i
was
frightened
for
my
heavy
pots
of
gold
and
silver
and
my
purses
of
money
how
should
i
ever
find
them
there
and
what
a
time
i
should
have
getting
them
out
i
reached
the
bank
of
the
stream
and
the
end
was
not
yet
but
i
could
see
it
a
little
way
off
on
the
other
side
i
crossed
the
creek
on
a
fallen
tree
and
still
ran
on
though
my
limbs
seemed
to
give
way
and
my
side
ached
with
fatigue
the
woods
grew
thicker
and
darker
the
ground
more
wet
and
swampy
and
i
found
as
many
grown
people
had
found
before
me
that
there
was
rather
hard
traveling
in
a
journey
after
riches
suddenly
i
met
in
my
way
a
large
porcupine
who
made
himself
still
larger
when
he
saw
me
as
a
cross
cat
raises
its
back
and
makes
tails
at
a
dog
fearing
that
he
would
shoot
his
sharp
quills
at
me
i
ran
from
him
as
fast
as
my
tired
feet
would
carry
me
in
my
fright
and
hurry
i
forgot
to
keep
my
eye
on
the
rainbow
as
i
had
done
before
and
when
at
last
i
remembered
and
looked
for
it
it
was
nowhere
in
sight
it
had
quite
faded
away
when
i
saw
that
it
was
indeed
gone
i
burst
into
tears
for
i
had
lost
all
my
treasures
and
had
nothing
to
show
for
my
pilgrimage
but
muddy
feet
and
a
wet
and
torn
frock
so
i
set
out
for
home
but
i
soon
found
that
my
troubles
had
only
begun
i
could
not
find
my
way
i
was
lost
i
could
not
tell
which
was
east
or
west
north
or
south
but
wandered
about
here
and
there
crying
and
calling
though
i
knew
that
no
one
could
hear
me
all
at
once
i
heard
voices
shouting
and
hallooing
but
instead
of
being
rejoiced
at
this
i
was
frightened
fearing
that
the
indians
were
upon
me
i
crawled
under
some
bushes
by
the
side
of
a
large
log
and
lay
perfectly
still
i
was
wet
cold
scared
altogether
very
miserable
indeed
yet
when
the
voices
came
near
i
did
not
start
up
and
show
myself
at
last
i
heard
my
own
name
called
but
i
remembered
that
indians
were
very
cunning
and
thought
they
might
have
found
it
out
some
way
so
i
did
not
answer
then
came
a
voice
near
me
that
sounded
like
that
of
my
eldest
brother
who
lived
away
from
home
and
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
many
months
but
i
dared
not
believe
that
the
voice
was
his
soon
some
one
sprang
up
on
the
log
by
which
i
lay
and
stood
there
calling
i
could
not
see
his
face
i
could
only
see
the
tips
of
his
toes
but
by
them
i
saw
that
he
wore
a
nice
pair
of
boots
and
not
moccasins
yet
i
remembered
that
some
indians
dressed
like
white
folks
so
i
still
kept
quiet
till
i
heard
shouted
over
me
a
pet
name
which
this
brother
had
given
me
it
was
the
funniest
name
in
the
world
i
knew
that
no
indian
knew
of
the
name
as
it
was
a
little
family
secret
so
i
sprang
up
and
caught
my
brother
about
the
ankles
i
hardly
think
that
an
indian
could
have
given
a
louder
yell
than
he
gave
then
and
he
jumped
so
that
he
fell
off
the
log
down
by
my
side
but
nobody
was
hurt
and
after
kissing
me
till
he
had
kissed
away
all
my
tears
he
hoisted
me
on
to
his
shoulder
called
my
other
brothers
who
were
hunting
in
different
directions
and
we
all
set
out
for
home
i
had
been
gone
nearly
three
hours
and
had
wandered
a
number
of
miles
my
brother
joseph
coming
and
asking
for
me
had
first
set
them
to
inquiring
and
searching
me
out
when
i
went
into
the
room
where
my
brother
rufus
sat
he
said
why
my
poor
little
sister
i
did
not
mean
to
send
you
off
on
such
a
chase
to
the
end
of
the
rainbow
i
thought
you
would
know
i
was
only
quizzing
you
then
my
eldest
brother
took
me
on
his
knee
and
told
me
what
the
rainbow
really
is
that
it
is
only
painted
air
and
does
not
rest
on
the
earth
so
nobody
could
ever
find
the
end
and
that
god
has
set
it
in
the
cloud
to
remind
him
and
us
of
his
promise
never
again
to
drown
the
world
with
a
flood
oh
i
think
god
promise
would
be
a
beautiful
name
for
the
rainbow
i
said
yes
replied
my
mother
but
it
tells
us
something
more
than
that
he
will
not
send
great
floods
upon
the
earth
it
tells
us
of
his
beautiful
love
always
bending
over
us
from
the
skies
and
i
trust
that
when
my
little
girl
sets
forth
on
a
pilgrimage
to
find
god
love
she
will
be
led
by
the
rainbow
of
his
promise
through
all
the
dark
places
of
this
world
to
laid
up
in
heaven

far

the
old
oaken
bucket
by
samuel
woodworth
who
was
born
in
massachusetts
in
he
was
both
author
and
editor
this
is
his
best
known
poem
he
died
in
how
dear
to
this
heart
are
the
scenes
of
my
childhood
when
fond
recollection
presents
them
to
view
the
orchard
the
meadow
the
deep
tangled
wildwood
and
every
loved
spot
which
my
infancy
knew
the
pond
and
the
mill
that
stood
by
it
the
bridge
and
the
rock
where
the
cataract
fell
the
cot
of
my
father
the
dairy
house
nigh
it

rude
bucket
which
hung
in
the
well

oaken
bucket
the
ironbound
bucket
the
bucket
which
hung
in
the
well
that
vessel
i
hail
as
a
treasure
for
often
at
noon
when
returned
from
the
field
i
found
it
the
source
of
an
exquisite
pleasure
the
purest
and
sweetest
that
nature
can
yield
how
ardent
i
seized
it
with
hands
that
were
glowing
and
quick
to
the
bottom
it
fell
then
soon
with
the
emblem
of
truth
overflowing
and
dripping
with
coolness
it
rose
from
the
well
the
old
oaken
bucket
the
ironbound
bucket
the
bucket
arose
from
the
well
how
sweet
from
the
green
mossy
brim
to
receive
it
as
poised
on
the
curb
it
inclined
to
my
lips
not
a
full
blushing
goblet
could
tempt
me
to
leave
it
though
filled
with
the
nectar
which
jupiter
sips
and
now
far
removed
from
thy
loved
situation
the
tear
of
regret
will
intrusively
swell
as
fancy
reverts
to
my
father
plantation
and
sighs
for
the
bucket
which
hangs
in
the
well

old
oaken
bucket

ironbound

the
sermon
on
the
mount
and
seeing
the
multitudes
he
went
up
into
a
mountain
and
when
he
was
set
his
disciples
came
unto
him
and
he
opened
his
mouth
and
taught
them
saying
blessed
are
the
poor
in
spirit
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
blessed
are
they
that
mourn
for
they
shall

which
are
persecuted
for

sake
for
theirs
is
the

blessed
are
ye
when
men
shall
revile
you
and
persecute
you
and
shall
say
all
manner
of
evil
against
you
falsely
for
my
sake
rejoice
and
be
exceeding
glad
for
great
is
your
reward
in
heaven
ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
said
by
them
of
old
time
thou
shalt
not
forswear
thyself
but
shalt
perform
unto
the
lord
thine
oaths
but
i
say
unto
you
swear
not
at
all
neither
by
heaven
for
it
is
god
throne
nor
by
the
earth
for
it
is
his
footstool
neither
by
jerusalem
for
it
is
the
city
of
the
great
king
neither
shalt
thou
swear
by
thy
head
because
thou
canst
not
make
one
hair
white
or
black
but
let
your
communication
be
yea
yea
nay
nay
for
whatsoever
is
more
than
these
cometh
of
evil
ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
said
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
but
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
resist
not
evil
but
whosoever
shall
smite
thee
on
thy
right
cheek
turn
to
him
the
other
also
and
if
any
man
will
sue
thee
at
the
law
and
take
away
thy
coat
let
him
have
thy
cloak
also
and
whosoever
shall
compel
thee
to
go
a
mile
go
with
him
twain
give
to
him
that
asketh
thee
and
from
him
that
would
borrow
of
thee
turn
not
thou
away
ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
said
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
and
hate
thine
enemy
but
i
say
unto
you
love
your
enemies
bless
them
that
curse
you
do
good
to
them
that
hate
you
and
pray
for
them
which
despitefully
use
you
and
persecute
you
that
ye
may
be
the
children
of
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
for
he
maketh
his
sun
to
rise
on
the
evil
and
on
the
good
and
sendeth
rain
on
the
just
and
on
the
unjust
for
if
ye
love
them
which
love
you
what
reward
have
ye
do
not
even
the
publicans
the
same
and
if
ye
salute
your
brethren
only
what
do
ye
more
than
others
do
not
even
the
publicans
so
be
ye
therefore
perfect
even
as
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
is
perfect
judge
not
that
ye
be
not
judged
for
with
what
judgment
ye
judge
ye
shall
be
judged
and
with
what
measure
ye
mete
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
and
why
beholdest
thou
the
mote
that
is
in
thy
brother
eye
but
considerest
not
the
beam
that
is
in
thine
own
eye
or
how
wilt
thou
say
to
thy
brother
let
me
pull
out
the
mote
out
of
thine
eye
and
behold
a
beam
is
in
thine
own
eye
thou
hypocrite
first
cast
out
the
beam
out
of
thine
own
eye
and
then
shalt
thou
see
clearly
to
cast
out
the
mote
out
of
thy
brother
eye
ask
and
it
shall
be
given
you
seek
and
ye
shall
find
knock
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you
for
everyone
that
asketh
receiveth
and
he
that
seeketh
findeth
and
to
him
that
knocketh
it
shall
be
opened
or
what
man
is
there
of
you
whom
if
his
son
ask
bread
will
he
give
him
a
stone
or
if
he
ask
a
fish
will
he
give
him
a
serpent
if
ye
then
being
evil
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
unto
your
children
how
much
more
shall
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
give
good
things
to
them
that
ask
him
therefore
all
things
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
even
so
to
them
for
this
is
the
law
and
the
prophets
whosoever
heareth
these
sayings
of
mine
and
doeth
them
i
will
liken
him
unto
a
wise
man
which
built
his
house
upon
a
rock
and
the
rain
descended
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
beat
upon
that
house
and
it
fell
not
for
it
was
founded
upon
a
rock
and
everyone
that
heareth
these
sayings
of
mine
and
doeth
them
not
shall
be
likened
unto
a
foolish
man
which
built
his
house
upon
the
sand
and
the
rain
descended
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
beat
upon
that
house
and
it
fell
and
great
was
the
fall
of
it
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jesus
had
ended
these
sayings
the
people
were
astonished
at
his
doctrine
for
he
taught
them
as
one
having
authority
and
not
as
the
scribes
l
one
who
receives
instruction
from
another
happy
to
come
into
possession
of
to
speak
against
without
cause
to
punish
on
account
of
religion
to
swear
falsely

cruelly

collectors
they
were
often
oppressive
and
were
hated

the
jews

among
the
jews
who
read
and
explained
the
law
to
the
people

delivered
this
sermon
who
are
blessed
and
why
is
it
right
to
swear
how
should
we
treat
our
enemies
should
we
judge
others
harshly
what
does

say
of
him
who
finds
faults
in

lxxiv
the
young
witness
by
hammond
a
little
girl
nine
years
of
age
was
brought
into
court
and
offered
as
a
witness
against
a
prisoner
who
was
on
trial
for
a
crime
committed
in
her
father
house
now
emily
said
the
counsel
for
the
prisoner
i
wish
to
know
if
you
understand
the
nature
of
an
oath
i
do
know
what
you
mean
was
the
simple
answer
your
honor
said
the
counsel
addressing
the
judge
it
is
evident
that
this
witness
should
be
rejected
she
does
not
understand
the
nature
of
an
oath
let
us
see
said
the
judge
come
here
my
daughter
assured
by
the
kind
tone
and
manner
of
the
judge
the
child
stepped
toward
him
and
looked
confidingly
in
his
face
with
a
calm
clear
eye
and
in
a
manner
so
artless
and
frank
that
it
went
straight
to
the
heart
did
you
ever
take
an
oath
inquired
the
judge
the
little
girl
stepped
back
with
a
look
of
horror
and
the
red
blood
rose
and
spread
in
a
blush
all
over
her
face
and
neck
as
she
answered
no
sir
she
thought
he
intended
to
ask
if
she
had
ever
used
profane
language
i
do
not
mean
that
said
the
judge
who
saw
her
mistake
i
mean
were
you
ever
a
witness
no
sir
i
never
was
in
court
before
was
the
answer
he
handed
her
the
bible
open
do
you
know
that
book
my
daughter
she
looked
at
it
and
answered
yes
sir
it
is
the
bible
do
you
ever
read
in
it
he
asked
yes
sir
every
evening
can
you
tell
me
what
the
bible
is
inquired
the
judge
it
is
the
word
of
the
great
god
she
answered
well
said
the
judge
place
your
hand
upon
this
bible
and
listen
to
what
i
say
and
he
repeated
slowly
and
solemnly
the
following
oath
do
you
swear
that
in
the
evidence
which
you
shall
give
in
this
case
you
will
tell
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
and
that
you
will
ask
god
to
help
you
i
do
she
replied
now
said
the
judge
you
have
been
sworn
as
a
witness
will
you
tell
me
what
will
befall
you
if
you
do
not
tell
the
truth
i
shall
be
shut
up
in
the
state
prison
answered
the
child
anything
else
asked
the
judge
i
shall
never
go
to
heaven
she
replied
how
do
you
know
this
asked
the
judge
again
the
child
took
the
bible
turned
rapidly
to
the
chapter
containing
the
commandments
and
pointing
to
the
one
which
reads
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
against
thy
neighbor
said
i
learned
that
before
i
could
read
has
anyone
talked
with
you
about
being
a
witness
in
court
here
against
this
man
inquired
the
judge
yes
sir
she
replied
my
mother
heard
they
wanted
me
to
be
a
witness
and
last
night
she
called
me
to
her
room
and
asked
me
to
tell
her
the
ten
commandments
and
then
we
kneeled
down
together
and
she
prayed
that
i
might
understand
how
wicked
it
was
to
bear
false
witness
against
my
neighbor
and
that
god
would
help
me
a
little
child
to
tell
the
truth
as
it
was
before
him
and
when
i
came
up
here
with
father
she
kissed
me
and
told
me
to
remember
the
ninth
commandment
and
that
god
would
hear
every
word
that
i
said
do
you
believe
this
asked
the
judge
while
a
tear
glistened
in
his
eye
and
his
lip
quivered
with
emotion
yes
sir
said
the
child
with
a
voice
and
manner
which
showed
that
her
conviction
of
the
truth
was
perfect
god
bless
you
my
child
said
the
judge
you
have
a
good
mother
the
witness
is
competent
he
continued
were
i
on
trial
for
my
life
and
innocent
of
the
charge
against
me
i
would
pray
god
for
such
a
witness
as
this
let
her
be
examined
she
told
her
story
with
the
simplicity
of
a
child
as
she
was
but
her
voice
and
manner
carried
conviction
of
her
truthfulness
to
every
heart
the
lawyers
asked
her
many
perplexing
questions
but
she
did
not
vary
in
the
least
from
her
first
statement
the
truth
as
spoken
by
a
little
child
was
sublime
falsehood
and
perjury
had
preceded
her
testimony
but
before
her
testimony
falsehood
was
scattered
like
chaff
the
little
child
for
whom
a
mother
had
prayed
for
strength
to
be
given
her
to
speak
the
truth
as
it
was
before
god
broke
the
cunning
device
of
matured
villainy
to
pieces
like
a
potter
vessel
the
strength
that
her
mother
prayed
for
was
given
her
and
the
sublime
and
terrible
simplicity
terrible
to
the
prisoner
and
his
associates
was
like
a
revelation
from
god
himself

from
the
story
of
a
bad
boy
by
thomas
bailey
aldrich
the
author
was
born
at
portsmouth
in
when
quite
young
his
family
moved
to
louisiana
but
he
was
sent
back
to
new
england
to
be
educated
and
later
he
located
at
new
york
he
is
a
writer
of
both
prose
and
poetry
now
boys
what
shall
we
do
i
asked
addressing
a
thoughtful
conclave
of
seven
assembled
in
our
barn
one
dismal
rainy
afternoon
let
have
a
theater
suggested
binny
wallace
the
very
thing
but
where
the
loft
of
the
stable
was
ready
to
burst
with
hay
provided
for
gypsy
but
the
long
room
over
the
carriage
house
was
unoccupied
the
place
of
all
places
my
managerial
eye
saw
at
a
glance
its
capabilities
for
a
theater
i
had
been
to
the
play
a
great
many
times
in
new
orleans
and
was
wise
in
matters
pertaining
to
the
drama
so
here
in
due
time
was
set
up
some
extraordinary
scenery
of
my
own
painting
the
curtain
i
recollect
though
it
worked
smoothly
enough
on
other
occasions
invariably
hitched
during
the
performances
the
theater
however
was
a
success
as
far
as
it
went
i
retired
from
the
business
with
no
fewer
than
fifteen
hundred
pins
after
deducting
the
headless
the
pointless
and
the
crooked
pins
with
which
our
doorkeeper
frequently
got
stuck
from
first
to
last
we
took
in
a
great
deal
of
this
counterfeit
money
the
price
of
admission
to
the
rivermouth
theater
was
twenty
pins
i
played
all
the
principal
characters
myself
not
that
i
was
a
finer
actor
than
the
other
boys
but
because
i
owned
the
establishment
at
the
tenth
representation
my
dramatic
career
was
brought
to
a
close
by
an
unfortunate
circumstance
we
were
playing
the
drama
of
william
tell
the
hero
of
switzerland
of
course
i
was
william
tell
in
spite
of
fred
langdon
who
wanted
to
act
that
character
himself
i
would
let
him
so
he
withdrew
from
the
company
taking
the
only
bow
and
arrow
we
had
i
made
a
crossbow
out
of
a
piece
of
whalebone
and
did
very
well
without
him
we
had
reached
that
exciting
scene
where
gesler
the
austrian
tyrant
commands
tell
to
shoot
the
apple
from
his
son
head
pepper
whitcomb
who
played
all
the
juvenile
and
women
parts
was
my
son
to
guard
against
mischance
a
piece
of
pasteboard
was
fastened
by
a
handkerchief
over
the
upper
portion
of
whitcomb
face
while
the
arrow
to
be
used
was
sewed
up
in
a
strip
of
flannel
i
was
a
capital
marksman
and
the
big
apple
only
two
yards
distant
turned
its
russet
cheek
fairly
towards
me
i
can
see
poor
little
pepper
now
as
he
stood
without
flinching
waiting
for
me
to
perform
my
great
feat
i
raised
the
crossbow
amid
the
breathless
silence
of
the
crowded
audience
consisting
of
seven
boys
and
three
girls
exclusive
of
kitty
collins
who
insisted
on
paying
her
way
in
with
a
clothespin
i
raised
the
crossbow
i
repeat
twang
went
the
whipcord
but
alas
instead
of
hitting
the
apple
the
arrow
flew
right
into
pepper
whitcomb
mouth
which
happened
to
be
open
at
the
time
and
destroyed
my
aim
i
shall
never
be
able
to
banish
that
awful
moment
from
my
memory
pepper
roar
expressive
of
astonishment
indignation
and
pain
is
still
ringing
in
my
ears
i
looked
upon
him
as
a
corpse
and
glancing
not
far
into
the
dreary
future
pictured
myself
led
forth
to
execution
in
the
presence
of
the
very
same
spectators
then
assembled
luckily
poor
pepper
was
not
seriously
hurt
but
grandfather
nutter
appearing
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
attracted
by
the
howls
of
young
tell
issued
an
injunction
against
all
theatricals
thereafter
and
the
place
was
closed
not
however
without
a
farewell
speech
from
me
in
which
i
said
that
this
would
have
been
the
proudest
moment
of
my
life
if
i
had
hit
pepper
whitcomb
in
the
mouth
whereupon
the
audience
assisted
i
am
glad
to
state
by
pepper
cried
hear

i
then
attributed
the
accident
to
pepper
himself
whose
mouth
being
open
at
the
instant
i
fired
acted
upon
the
arrow
much
after
the
fashion
of
a
whirlpool
and
drew
in
the
fatal
shaft
i
was
about
to
explain
how
a
comparatively
small
maelstrom
could
suck
in
the
largest
ship
when
the
curtain
fell
of
its
own
accord
amid
the
shouts
of
the
audience
this
was
my
last
appearance
on
any
stage
it
was
some
time

alfred
the
great
more
than
a
thousand
years
ago
in
the
year
a
prince
was
born
in
england
who
afterwards
became
one
of
the
most
celebrated
and
best
loved
kings
in
the
world
his
name
was
alfred
afterwards
called
alfred
the
great
and
he
was
the
favorite
son
both
of
the
king
and
queen
in
those
days
the
common
people
were
very
ignorant
few
of
them
could
even
read
and
write
there
were
no
schools
and
the
monasteries
where
almost
the
only
teaching
had
been
done
were
nearly
all
destroyed
in
the
wars
which
were
continually
going
on
only
the
higher
classes
had
any
chance
to
study
and
even
they
paid
much
more
attention
to
fighting
than
to
studying
but
alfred
was
different
from
most
persons
of
his
time
even
when
a
little
boy
he
delighted
in
listening
to
poems
and
to
the
ballads
which
harpers
used
to
sing
and
he
learned
many
of
them
by
heart
when
he
was
twelve
years
old
his
mother
the
queen
offered
to
give
a
volume
of
poems
to
that
one
of
her
four
sons
who
would
first
learn
to
read
it
alfred
was
the
youngest
of
them
all
yet
he
easily
won
the
prize
of
which
his
brothers
thought
so
little
but
as
has
been
said
these
were
stirring
times
and
alfred
was
soon
called
on
to
show
his
great
abilities
as
a
soldier
the
danes
a
warlike
people
were
continually
swooping
down
in
their
vessels
upon
the
coast
of
england
often
they
spread
over
the
entire
country
plundering
and
burning
the
towns
and
killing
the
people
in
the
midst
of
these
invasions
alfred
became
king
when
he
was
only
years
old
he
proved
as
good
a
warrior
as
he
was
a
student
he
thought
that
whatever
is
worth
doing
at
all
is
worth
doing
well
he
was
generally
successful
against
the
danes
but
at
one
time
they
seemed
to
have
the
country
entirely
in
their
power
and
alfred
was
compelled
to
hide
for
his
life
for
some
time
he
dressed
as
a
peasant
and
lived
in
the
cottage
of
a
cowherd
who
was
so
careful
of
his
king
safety
that
he
did
not
even
tell
his
wife
who
he
was
so
she
treated
the
king
as
a
common
peasant
and
one
day
gave
him
a
sharp
scolding
because
he
allowed
some
cakes
to
burn
on
the
griddle
after
she
had
left
him
to
watch
them
she
told
him
he
was
clever
enough
at
eating
cakes
though
he
managed
so
badly
at
baking
them
when
the
search
for
him
grew
less
active
alfred
gradually
collected
some
of
his
followers
with
whom
he
encamped
on
a
small
spot
of
firm
ground
in
the
center
of
a
bog
it
was
surrounded
by
almost
impassable
forests
and
alfred
fortified
the
place
so
that
it
could
not
well
be
taken
then
he
made
frequent
sudden
and
successful
attacks
on
the
enemy
until
his
troops
and
the
people
became
encouraged
one
victory
in
particular
when
they
captured
a
banner
which
the
danes
thought
enchanted
led
alfred
to
take
bolder
steps
he
wished
to
find
out
the
exact
condition
of
the
enemy
and
for
this
purpose
disguised
himself
as
a
harper
and
entered
their
camp
he
was
so
successful
in
his
disguise
that
he
remained
there
some
days
even
being
admitted
to
the
tent
of
the
danish
leader
guthrum
he
found
their
entire
army
living
in
careless
security
and
so
he
determined
to
make
a
sudden
and
bold
attack
on
them
to
try
and
rid
his
country
once
more
of
these
cruel
invaders
he
summoned
his
people
about
him
from
far
and
wide
many
of
them
had
long
thought
their
beloved
king
dead
but
now
all
eagerly
obeyed
his
call
he
at
once
led
them
against
that
part
of
the
camp
which
he
had
seen
to
be
most
unguarded
the
attack
was
entirely
unexpected
and
although
the
danes
were
greater
in
numbers
they
were
defeated
with
great
slaughter
some
of
them
with
their
leader
fled
to
a
fortified
place
but
were
soon
obliged
to
surrender
alfred
granted
them
their
lives
and
settled
them
in
a
part
of
his
kingdom
where
nearly
all
his
own
people
had
been
destroyed
he
hoped
by
this
to
change
obstinate
enemies
into
useful
friends
who
would
protect
england
from
further
attacks
of
their
own
countrymen
however
some
years
later
when
the
danes
made
another
invasion
these
people
joined
them
in
fighting
against
alfred
but
he
soon
succeeded
in
driving
them
all
out
of
the
country
much
as
alfred
did
for
his
people
in
war
he
did
more
in
time
of
peace
above
all
else
he
gave
careful
attention
to
their
education
he
rebuilt
the
monasteries
and
aided
the
young
university
of
oxford
he
also
founded
many
schools
to
which
every
owner
of
a
certain
portion
of
land
was
compelled
to
send
his
children
but
he
did
as
much
good
by
the
example
that
he
set
as
by
these
acts
his
time
was
divided
into
three
parts
one
was
given
to
business
one
to
refreshment
by
sleep
and
food
and
the
third
to
study
and
devotion
clocks
and
watches
and
probably
even
sundials
were
then
unknown
so
these
divisions
were
marked
by
burning
candles
of
equal
lengths
alfred
did
not
study
for
his
own
pleasure
merely
but
translated
and
wrote

works

the
good
of

people

the
simple
language

they
could
easily
understand
and
enjoy

handsome
and
dignified

of
grace
and

the
more
noble
beauty
was

heart

lxxix
hugh
idle
and
toil
adapted
from
the
story
of
little
daffydowndilly
by
nathaniel
hawthorne
the
author
was
born
at
salem
in
and
ranks
among
the
first
of
american
novelists
he
died
in
hugh
idle
loved
to
do
only
what
was
agreeable
and
took
no
delight
in
labor
of
any
kind
but
while
hugh
was
yet
a
little
boy
he
was
sent
away
from
home
and
put
under
the
care
of
a
very
strict
schoolmaster
who
went
by
the
name
of
toil
those
who
knew
him
best
affirmed
that
toil
was
a
very
worthy
character
and
that
he
had
done
more
good
both
to
children
and
grown
people
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
he
had
however
a
severe
and
ugly
countenance
his
voice
was
harsh
and
all
his
ways
and
customs
were
disagreeable
to
our
young
friend
hugh
idle
the
whole
day
long
this
terrible
old
schoolmaster
sulked
about
among
his
scholars
with
a
big
cane
in
his
hand
and
unless
a
lad
chose
to
attend
constantly
and
quietly
to
his
book
he
had
no
chance
of
enjoying
a
single
quiet
moment
this
will
never
do
for
me
thought
hugh
i
run
off
and
try
to
find
my
way
home
so
the
very
next
morning
off
he
started
with
only
some
bread
and
cheese
for
his
breakfast
and
very
little
pocket
money
to
pay
his
expenses
he
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
when
he
overtook
a
man
of
grave
and
sedate
appearance
trudging
at
a
moderate
pace
along
the
road
good
morning
my
fine
lad
said
the
stranger
and
his
voice
seemed
hard
and
severe
yet
had
a
sort
of
kindness
in
it
whence
do
you
come
so
early
and
whither
are
you
going
now
hugh
was
a
boy
of
very
frank
disposition
and
had
never
been
known
to
tell
a
lie
in
all
his
life
nor
did
he
tell
one
now
but
confessed
that
he
had
run
away
from
school
on
account
of
his
great
dislike
to
toil
oh
very
well
my
little
friend
answered
the
stranger
then
we
will
go
together
for
i
likewise
have
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
toil
and
should
be
glad
to
find
some
place
where
he
was
never
heard
of
so
they
walked
on
very
sociably
side
by
side
by
and
by
their
road
led
them
past
a
field
where
some
haymakers
were
at
work
hugh
could
not
help
thinking
how
much
pleasanter
it
must
be
to
make
hay
in
the
sunshine
under
the
blue
sky
than
to
learn
lessons
all
day
long
shut
up
in
a
dismal
schoolroom
continually
watched
by
toil
but
in
the
midst
of
these
thoughts
while
he
was
stopping
to
peep
over
the
stone
wall
he
started
back
and
caught
hold
of
his
companion
hand
quick
quick
cried
he
let
us
run
away
or
he
will
catch
us
who
will
catch
us
asked
the
stranger
toil
the
old
schoolmaster
answered
hugh
do
you
see
him
among
the
haymakers
and
hugh
pointed
to
an
elderly
man
who
seemed
to
be
the
owner
of
the
field
he
was
busily
at
work
in
his
shirt
sleeves
the
drops
of
sweat
stood
upon
his
brow
and
he
kept
constantly
crying
out
to
his
work
people
to
make
hay
while
the
sun
shone
strange
to
say
the
features
of
the
old
farmer
were
precisely
the
same
as
those
of
toil
who
at
that
very
moment
must
have
been
just
entering
the
schoolroom
do
be
afraid
said
the
stranger
this
is
not
toil
the
schoolmaster
but
a
brother
of
his
who
was
bred
a
farmer
he
trouble
you
unless
you
become
a
laborer
on
his
farm
hugh
believed
what
his
companion
said
but
was
glad
when
they
were
out
of
sight
of
the
old
farmer
who
bore
such
a
singular
resemblance
to
toil
the
two
travelers
came
to
a
spot
where
some
carpenters
were
building
a
house
hugh
begged
his
companion
to
stop
awhile
for
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
how
neatly
the
carpenters
did
their
work
with
their
saws
planes
and
hammers
and
he
was
beginning
to
think
he
too
should
like
to
use
the
saw
and
the
plane
and
the
hammer
and
be
a
carpenter
himself
but
suddenly
he
caught
sight
of
something
that
made
him
seize
his
hand
in
a
great
fright
make
haste
quick
quick
cried
he
there
old
toil
again
the
stranger
cast
his
eyes
where
hugh
pointed
his
finger
and
saw
an
elderly
man
who
seemed
to
be
overseeing
the
carpenters
as
he
went
to
and
fro
about
the
unfinished
house
marking
out
the
work
to
be
done
and
urging
the
men
to
be
diligent
and
wherever
he
turned
his
hard
and
wrinkled
visage
they
sawed
and
hammered
as
if
for
dear
life
oh
no
this
is
not
toil
the
schoolmaster
said
the
stranger
it
is
another
brother
of
his
who
follows
the
trade
of
carpenter
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
quoth
hugh
but
if
you
please
sir
i
should
like
to
get
out
of
his
way
as
soon
as
possible
pleasing
declared
costs
calm
neither
fast
nor
slow
natural
state
of
mind
in
a
friendly
way
the
distinctive
marks
of
the
face
likeness
industrious
the
face
quoth
said
lxxx
hugh
idle
and
toil
concluded
now
hugh
and
the
stranger
had
not
gone
much
further
when
they
met
a
company
of
soldiers
gayly
dressed
with
feathers
in
their
caps
and
glittering
muskets
on
their
shoulders
in
front
marched
the
drummers
and
fifers
making
such
merry
music
that
hugh
would
gladly
have
followed
them
to
the
end
of
the
world
if
he
were
only
a
soldier
he
said
to
himself
old
toil
would
never
venture
to
look
him
in
the
face
quickstep
forward
march
shouted
a
gruff
voice
little
hugh
started
in
great
dismay
for
this
voice
sounded
precisely
like
that
which
he
had
heard
every
day
in
toil
schoolroom
and
turning
his
eyes
to
the
captain
of
the
company
what
should
he
see
but
the
very
image
of
old
toil
himself
in
an
officer
dress
to
be
sure
but
looking
as
ugly
and
disagreeable
as
ever
this
is
certainly
old
toil
said
hugh
in
a
trembling
voice
let
us
away
for
fear
he
should
make
us
enlist
in
his
company
you
are
mistaken
again
my
little
friend
replied
the
stranger
very
composedly
this
is
only
a
brother
of
toil
who
has
served
in
the
army
all
his
life
you
and
i
need
not
be
afraid
of
him
well
well
said
hugh
if
you
please
sir
i
do
want
to
see
the
soldiers
any
more
so
the
child
and
the
stranger
resumed
their
journey
and
after
awhile
they
came
to
a
house
by
the
roadside
where
a
number
of
young
men
and
girls
with
smiles
on
their
faces
were
dancing
to
the
sound
of
a
fiddle
oh
let
us
stop
here
cried
hugh
toil
will
never
dare
to
show
his
face
where
there
is
a
fiddler
and
where
people
are
dancing
and
making
merry
but
the
words
had
scarcely
died
away
on
the
little
boy
tongue
when
happening
to
cast
his
eyes
on
the
fiddler
whom
should
he
behold
again
but
the
likeness
of
toil
armed
with
a
fiddle
bow
this
time
and
flourishing
it
with
as
much
ease
and
dexterity
as
if
he
had
been
a
fiddler
all
his
life
oh
dear
me
whispered
he
turning
pale
it
seems
as
if
there
were
nobody
but
toil
in
the
world
this
is
not
your
old
schoolmaster
observed
the
stranger
but
another
brother
of
his
who
has
learned
to
be
a
fiddler
he
is
ashamed
of
his
family
and
generally
calls
himself
master
pleasure
but
his
real
name
is
toil
and
those
who
know
him
best
think
him
still
more
disagreeable
than
his
brothers
pray
let
us
go
on
said
hugh
well
thus
the
two
went
wandering
along
the
highway
and
in
shady
lanes
and
through
pleasant
villages
and
wherever
they
went
behold
there
was
the
image
of
old
toil
if
they
entered
a
house
he
sat
in
the
parlor
if
they
peeped
into
the
kitchen
he
was
there
he
made
himself
at
home
in
every
cottage
and
stole
under
one
disguise
or
another
into
the
most
splendid
mansions
everywhere
they
stumbled
on
some
of
the
old
schoolmaster
innumerable
brothers
at
length
little
hugh
found
himself
completely
worn
out
with
running
away
from
toil
take
me
back
take
me
back
cried
the
poor
fellow
bursting
into
tears
if
there
is
nothing
but
toil
all
the
world
over
i
may
just
as
well
go
back
to
the
schoolhouse
yonder
it
is
there
is
the
schoolhouse
said
the
stranger
for
though
he
and
little
hugh
had
taken
a
great
many
steps
they
had
traveled
in
a
circle
instead
of
a
straight
line
come
we
will
go
back
to
the
school
together
there
was
something
in
his
companion
voice
that
little
hugh
now
remembered
and
it
is
strange
that
he
had
not
remembered
it
sooner
looking
up
into
his
face
behold
there
again
was
the
likeness
of
old
toil
so
that
the
poor
child
had
been
in
company
with
toil
all
day
even
while
he
had
been
doing
his
best
to
run
away
from
him
little
hugh
idle
however
had
learned
a
good
lesson
and
from
that
time
forward
was
diligent
at
his
task
because
he
now
knew
that
diligence
is
not
a
whit
more
toilsome
than
sport
or
idleness
and
when
he
became
better
acquainted
with
toil
he
began
to
think
his
ways
were
not
so
disagreeable
and
that
the
old
schoolmaster
smile
of
approbation
made
his
face
sometimes
appear
almost
as
pleasant
as
even
that
of
mother
l
to
dare
to
risk
fright
terror
exactly
to
put
one
name
on
a
roll
to
join
calmly
quietly
re
sumed
recommenced
remarked
not
to
be
counted
the
act
of
regarding
with
pleasure
to
whose
school
was
hugh
idle
sent
why
did
he
run
away
relate
the
adventures
of
hugh
and
the
stranger
what
lesson
is
taught
by
this
story
lxxxi
burning
the
fallow
adapted
from
roughing
it
in
the
bush
a
story
by
susanna
moodie
sister
of
agnes
strickland
who
was
born
in
suffolk
england
in
she
died
in
the
day
was
sultry
and
towards
noon
a
strong
wind
sprang
up
that
roared
in
the
pine
tops
like
the
dashing
of
distant
billows
but
without
in
the
least
degree
abating
the
heat
the
children
were
lying
listlessly
upon
the
floor
and
the
girl
and
i
were
finishing
sunbonnets
when
mary
suddenly
exclaimed
bless
us
mistress
what
a
smoke
i
ran
immediately
to
the
door
but
was
not
able
to
distinguish
ten
yards
before
me
the
swamp
immediately
below
us
was
on
fire
and
the
heavy
wind
was
driving
a
dense
black
cloud
of
smoke
directly
towards
us
what
can
this
mean
i
cried
who
can
have
set
fire
to
the
fallow
as
i
ceased
speaking
john
thomas
stood
pale
and
trembling
before
me
john
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
fire
oh
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
it
was
i
set
fire
to
it
and
i
would
give
all
i
have
in
the
world
if
i
had
not
done
it
what
is
the
danger
oh
i
afraid
that
we
shall
all
be
burnt
up
said
john
beginning
to
whimper
what
shall
we
do
why
we
must
get
out
of
it
as
fast
as
we
can
and
leave
the
house
to
its
fate
we
ca
get
out
said
the
man
in
a
low
hollow
tone
which
seemed
the
concentration
of
fear
i
would
have
got
out
of
it
if
i
could
but
just
step
to
the
back
door
and
see
behind
before
on
every
side
we
were
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
fire
burning
furiously
within
a
hundred
yards
of
us
and
cutting
off
all
possibility
of
retreat
for
could
we
have
found
an
opening
through
the
burning
heaps
we
could
not
have
seen
our
way
through
the
dense
canopy
of
smoke
and
buried
as
we
were
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
no
one
could
discover
our
situation
till
we
were
beyond
the
reach
of
help
i
closed
the
door
and
went
back
to
the
parlor
fear
was
knocking
loudly
at
my
heart
for
our
utter
helplessness
destroyed
all
hope
of
our
being
able
to
effect
our
escape
the
girl
sat
upon
the
floor
by
the
children
who
unconscious
of
the
peril
that
hung
over
them
had
both
fallen
asleep
she
was
silently
weeping
while
the
boy
who
had
caused
the
mischief
was
crying
aloud
a
strange
calm
succeeded
my
first
alarm
i
sat
down
upon
the
step
of
the
door
and
watched
the
awful
scene
in
silence
the
fire
was
raging
in
the
cedar
swamp
immediately
below
the
ridge
on
which
the
house
stood
and
it
presented
a
spectacle
truly
appalling
from
out
of
the
dense
folds
of
a
canopy
of
black
smoke
the
blackest
i
ever
saw
leaped
up
red
forks
of
lurid
flame
as
high
as
the
tree
tops
igniting
the
branches
of
a
group
of
tall
pines
that
had
been
left
for
saw
logs
a
deep
gloom
blotted
out
the
heavens
from
our
sight
the
air
was
filled
with
fiery
particles
which
floated
even
to
the
doorstep
while
the
crackling
and
roaring
of
the
flames
might
have
been
heard
at
a
great
distance
to
reach
the
shore
of
the
lake
we
must
pass
through
the
burning
swamp
and
not
a
bird
could
pass
over
it
with
unscorched
wings
the
fierce
wind
drove
the
flames
at
the
sides
and
back
of
the
house
up
the
clearing
and
our
passage
to
the
road
or
to
the
forest
on
the
right
and
left
was
entirely
obstructed
by
a
sea
of
flames
our
only
ark
of
safety
was
the
house
so
long
as
it
remained
untouched
by
the
fire
i
turned
to
young
thomas
and
asked
him
how
long
he
thought
that
would
he
when
the
fire
clears
this
little

the
lord
have
mercy
on
us
then
or
we
must
all
go
i
threw
myself
down
on
the
floor
beside
my
children
and
pressed
them
to
my
heart
while
inwardly
i
thanked
god
that
they
were
asleep
unconscious
of
danger
and
unable
by
their
cries
to
distract
our
attention
from
adopting
any
plan
which
might
offer
to
effect
their
escape
the
heat
soon
became
suffocating
we
were
parched
with
thirst
and
there
was
not
a
drop
of
water
in
the
house
and
none
to
be
procured
nearer
than
the
lake
i
turned
once
more
to
the
door
hoping
that
a
passage
might
have
been
burnt
through
to
the
water
i
saw
nothing
but
a
dense
cloud
of
fire
and
smoke
could
hear
nothing
but
the
crackling
and
roaring
of
flames
which
was
gaining
so
fast
upon
us
that
i
felt
their
scorching
breath
in
my
face
ah
thought
i
and
it
was
a
most
bitter
thought
what
will
my
beloved
husband
say
when
he
returns
and
finds
that
his
poor
wife
and
his
dear
girls
have
perished
in
this
miserable
manner
but
god
can
save
us
yet
the
thought
had
scarcely
found
a
voice
in
my
heart
before
the
wind
rose
to
a
hurricane
scattering
the
flames
on
all
sides
into
a
tempest
of
burning
billows
i
buried
my
head
in
my
apron
for
i
thought
that
all
was
lost
when
a
most
terrific
crash
of
thunder
burst
over
our
heads
and
like
the
breaking
of
a
waterspout
down
came
the
rushing
torrent
of
rain
which
had
been
pent
up
for
so
many
weeks
in
a
few
minutes
the
chip
yard
was
all
afloat
and
the
fire
effectually
checked
the
storm
which
unnoticed
by
us
had
been
gathering
all
day
and
which
was
the
only
one
of
any
note
we
had
that
summer
continued
to
rage
all

the
attack
on
nymwegen
from
the
history
of
the
united
netherlands
by
john
lothrop
motley
who
was
born
in
at
dorchester
mass
he
graduated
at
harvard
in
and
afterwards
lived
many
years
in
europe
writing
the
histories
which
made
him
famous
he
died
in
on
the
evening
of
the
of
august
there
was
a
wedding
feast
in
one
of
the
splendid
mansions
of
the
stately
city
the
festivities
were
prolonged
until
deep
in
the
midsummer
night
and
harp
and
viol
were
still
inspiring
the
feet
of
the
dancers
when
on
a
sudden
in
the
midst
of
the
holiday
groups
appeared
the
grim
visage
of
martin
schenk
the
man
who
never
smiled
clad
in
no
wedding
garment
but
in
armor
of
proof
with
morion
on
head
and
sword
in
hand
the
great
freebooter
strode
heavily
through
the
ballroom
followed
by
a
party
of
those
terrible
musketeers
who
never
gave
or
asked
for
quarter
while
the
affrighted
revelers
fluttered
away
before
them
taking
advantage
of
a
dark
night
he
had
just
dropped
down
the
river
from
his
castle
with
five
and
twenty
barges
had
landed
with
his
most
trusted
soldiers
in
the
foremost
vessels
had
battered
down
the
gate
of
anthony
and
surprised
and
slain
the
guard
without
waiting
for
the
rest
of
his
boats
he
had
then
stolen
with
his
comrades
through
the
silent
streets
and
torn
away
the
latticework
and
other
slight
defenses
on
the
rear
of
the
house
which
they
had
now
entered
and
through
which
they
intended
to
possess
themselves
of
the
market
place
martin
had
long
since
selected
this
mansion
as
a
proper
position
for
his
enterprise
but
he
had
not
been
bidden
to
the
wedding
and
was
somewhat
disconcerted
when
he
found
himself
on
the
festive
scene
which
he
had
so
grimly
interrupted
some
of
the
merrymakers
escaped
from
the
house
and
proceeded
to
alarm
the
town
while
schenk
hastily
fortified
his
position
and
took
possession
of
the
square
but
the
burghers
and
garrison
were
soon
on
foot
and
he
was
driven
back
into
the
house
three
times
he
recovered
the
square
by
main
strength
of
his
own
arm
seconded
by
the
handful
of
men
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
and
three
times
he
was
beaten
back
by
overwhelming
numbers
into
the
wedding
mansion
the
arrival
of
the
greater
part
of
his
followers
with
whose
assistance
he
could
easily
have
mastered
the
city
in
the
first
moments
of
surprise
was
mysteriously
delayed
he
could
not
account
for
their
prolonged
absence
and
was
meanwhile
supported
only
by
those
who
had
arrived
with
him
in
the
foremost
barges
the
truth
of
which
he
was
ignorant
was
that
the
remainder
of
the
flotilla
borne
along
by
the
strong
and
deep
current
of
the
waal
then
in
a
state
of
freshet
had
shot
past
the
landing
place
and
had
ever
since
been
vainly
struggling
against
wind
and
tide
to
force
their
way
back
to
the
necessary
point
meantime
schenk
and
his
followers
fought
desperately
in
the
market
place
and
desperately
in
the
house
which
he
had
seized
but
a
whole
garrison
and
a
town
full
of
citizens
in
arms
proved
too
much
for
him
and
he
was
now
hotly
besieged
in
the
mansion
and
at
last
driven
forth
into
the
streets
by
this
time
day
was
dawning
the
whole
population
soldiers
and
burghers
men
women
and
children
were
thronging
about
the
little
band
of
marauders
and
assailing
them
with
every
weapon
and
every
missile
to
be
found
schenk
fought
with
his
usual
ferocity
but
at
last
the
musketeers
in
spite
of
his
indignant
commands
began
rapidly
to
retreat
toward
the
quay
in
vain
martin
stormed
and
cursed
in
vain
with
his
own
hand
he
struck
more
than
one
of
his
soldiers
dead
he
was
swept
along
with
the
band
and
when
shouting
and
gnashing
his
teeth
with
frenzy
he
reached
the
quay
at
last
he
saw
at
a
glance
why
his
great
enterprise
had
failed
the
few
empty
barges
of
his
own
party
were
moored
at
the
steps
the
rest
were
half
a
mile
off
contending
hopelessly
against
the
swollen
and
rapid
waal
schenk
desperately
wounded
was
left
almost
alone
upon
the
wharf
for
his
routed
followers
had
plunged
into
the
boats
several
of
which
overladen
in
the
panic
sank
at
once
leaving
the
soldiers
to
drown
or
struggle
with
the
waves
the
game
was
lost
nothing
was
left
the
freebooter
but
retreat
reluctantly
turning
his
back
on
his
enemies
now
in
full
cry
close
behind
him
schenk
sprang
into
the
last
remaining
boat
just
pushing
from
the
quay
already
overladen
it
foundered
with
his
additional
weight
and
martin
schenk
encumbered
with
his
heavy
armor
sank
at
once
to
the
bottom
of
the
waal
some
of
the
fugitives
succeeded
in
swimming
down
the
stream
and
were
picked
up
by
their
comrades
in
the
barges
below
the
town
and
so
made
their
escape

were
drowned
with

the

selection
is
adapted
from
the
story
of

he
died
in
the
black
dreary
night
seemed
interminable
he
could
only
guess
here
and
there
at
a
landmark
and
was
forced
to
rely
more
upon
instinct
of
the
road
than
upon
the
guidance
of
his
senses
toward
midnight
as
he
judged
by
the
solitary
crow
of
a
cock
the
rain
almost
entirely
ceased
the
wind
began
to
blow
sharp
and
keen
and
the
hard
vault
of
the
sky
to
lift
a
little
he
fancied
that
the
hills
on
his
right
had
fallen
away
and
that
the
horizon
was
suddenly
depressed
towards
the
north
roger
feet
began
to
splash
in
constantly
deepening
water
and
presently
a
roar
distinct
from
that
of
the
wind
filled
the
air
it
was
the
brandywine
the
stream
had
overflowed
its
broad
meadow
bottoms
and
was
running
high
and
fierce
beyond
its
main
channel
the
turbid
waters
made
a
dim
dusky
gleam
around
him
soon
the
fences
disappeared
and
the
flood
reached
to
his
horse
body
but
he
knew
that
the
ford
could
be
distinguished
by
the
break
in
the
fringe
of
timber
moreover
that
the
creek
bank
was
a
little
higher
than
the
meadows
behind
it
and
so
far
at
least
he
might
venture
the
ford
was
not
more
than
twenty
yards
across
and
he
could
trust
roger
to
swim
that
distance
the
faithful
animal
pressed
bravely
on
but
gilbert
soon
noticed
that
he
seemed
at
fault
the
swift
water
had
forced
him
out
of
the
road
and
he
stopped
from
time
to
time
as
if
anxious
and
uneasy
the
timber
could
now
be
discerned
only
a
short
distance
in
advance
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
would
gain
the
bank
what
was
that
a
strange
rustling
hissing
sound
as
of
cattle
trampling
through
dry
reeds
a
sound
which
quivered
and
shook
even
in
the
breath
of
the
hurrying
wind
roger
snorted
stood
still
and
trembled
in
every
limb
and
a
sensation
of
awe
and
terror
struck
a
chill
through
gilbert
heart
the
sound
drew
swiftly
nearer
and
became
a
wild
seething
roar
filling
the
whole
breadth
of
the

but
the
advance
wave
of
the
coming
inundation
already
touched
his
side
he
staggered
a
line
of
churning
foam
bore
down
upon
them
the
terrible
roar
was
all
around
and
over
them
and
horse
and
rider
were
whirled
away
what
happened
during
the
first
few
seconds
gilbert
could
never

recall
now
they
were

in
the
water
now
riding
its
careering

torn
through
the
tops
of
brushwood
jostled
by
floating

was
still
swimming
with
it
desperately
throwing
up
his
head
from
time
to
time
and
snorting
the
water
from
his
nostrils
all
his
efforts
to
gain
a
foothold
failed
his
strength
was
nearly
spent
and
unless
some
help
should
come
in
a
few
minutes
it
would
come
in
vain
and
in
the
darkness
and
the
rapidity
with
which
they
were
borne
along
how
should
help
come
all
at
once
roger
course
stopped
he
became
an
obstacle
to
the
flood
which
pressed
him
against
some
other
obstacle
below
and
rushed
over
horse
and
rider
thrusting
out
his
hand
gilbert
felt
the
rough
bark
of
a
tree
leaning
towards
it
and
clasping
the
log
in
his
arms
he
drew
himself
from
the
saddle
while
roger
freed
from
his
burden
struggled
into
the
current
and
instantly
disappeared
as
nearly
as
gilbert
could
ascertain
several
timbers
thrown
over
each
other
had
lodged
probably
upon
a
rocky
islet
in
the
stream
the
uppermost
one
projecting
slantingly
out
of
the
flood
it
required
all
his
strength
to
resist
the
current
which
sucked
and
whirled
and
tugged
at
his
body
and
to
climb
high
enough
to
escape
its
force
without
overbalancing
his
support
at
last
though
still
half
immerged
he
found
himself
comparatively
safe
for
a
time
yet
as
far
as
ever
from
a
final
rescue
yet
a
new
danger
now
assailed
him
from
the
increasing
cold
there
was
already
a
sting
of
frost
a
breath
of
ice
in
the
wind
in
another
hour
the
sky
was
nearly
swept
bare
of
clouds
and
he
could
note
the
lapse
of
the
night
by
the
sinking
of
the
moon
but
he
was
by
this
time
hardly
in
a
condition
to
note
anything
more
endless
muddy
pro
made
out
distinguished
boiling
bubbling
hindering
obstucting

a
rushing

plunged
under
a
liquid
lapse

lxxxvi
brandywine
ford
concluded
the
moon
was
low
in
the
west
and
there
was
a
pale
glimmer
of
the
coming
dawn
in
the
sky
when
gilbert
potter
suddenly
raised
his
head
above
the
noise
of
the
water
and
the
whistle
of
the
wind
he
heard
a
familiar
sound
the
shrill
sharp
neigh
of
a
horse
lifting
himself
with
great
exertion
to
a
sitting
posture
he
saw
two
men
on
horseback
in
the
flooded
meadow
a
little
below
him
they
stopped
seemed
to
consult
and
presently
drew
nearer
gilbert
tried
to
shout
but
the
muscles
of
his
throat
were
stiff
and
his
lungs
refused
to
act
the
horse
neighed
again
this
time
there
was
no
mistake
it
was
roger
that
he
heard
voice
came
to
him
and
he
cried
aloud
a
hoarse
strange
unnatural
cry
the
horsemen
heard
it
and
rapidly
pushed
up
the
bank
until
they
reached
a
point
directly
opposite
to
him
the
prospect
of
escape
brought
a
thrill
of
life
to
his
frame
he
looked
around
and
saw
that
the
flood
had
indeed
fallen
we
have
no
rope
he
heard
one
of
the
men
say
how
shall
we
reach
him
there
is
no
time
to
get
one
now
the
other
answered
my
horse
is
stronger
than
yours
i
go
into
the
creek
just
below
where
it
broader
and
not
so
deep
and
work
my
way
up
to
him
but
one
horse
ca
carry
both
his
will
follow
be
sure
when
it
sees
me
as
the
last
speaker
moved
away
gilbert
saw
a
led
horse
plunging
through
the
water
beside
the
other
it
was
a
difficult
and
dangerous
undertaking
the
horseman
and
the
loose
horse
entered
the
main
stream
below
where
its
divided
channel
met
and
broadened
but
it
was
still
above
the
saddle
girths
and
very
swift
sometimes
the
animals
plunged
losing
their
foothold
nevertheless
they
gallantly
breasted
the
current
and
inch
by
inch
worked
their
way
to
a
point
about
six
feet
below
gilbert
it
seemed
impossible
to
approach
nearer
can
you
swim
asked
the
man
gilbert
shook
his
head
throw
me
the
end
of
roger
bridle
he
then
cried
the
man
unbuckled
the
bridle
and
threw
it
keeping
the
end
of
the
rein
in
his
hand
gilbert
tried
to
grasp
it
but
his
hands
were
too
numb
he
managed
however
to
get
one
arm
and
his
head
through
the
opening
and
relaxed
his
hold
on
the
log
a
plunge
and
the
man
had
him
by
the
collar
he
felt
himself
lifted
by
a
strong
arm
and
laid
across
roger
saddle
with
his
failing
strength
and
stiff
limbs
it
was
no
slight
task
to
get
into
place
and
the
return
though
less
laborious
to
the
horses
was
equally
dangerous
because
gilbert
was
scarcely
able
to
support
himself
without
help
you
safe
now
said
the
man
when
they
reached
the
bank
but
it
a
downright
mercy
of
god
that
you
alive
the
other
horseman
joined
them
and
they
rode
slowly
across
the
flooded
meadow
they
had
both
thrown
their
cloaks
around
gilbert
and
carefully
steadied
him
in
the
saddle
one
on
each
side
he
was
too
much
exhausted
to
ask
how
they
had
found
him
or
whither
they
were
taking
him
too
numb
for
curiosity
almost
for
gratitude
here
your
savior
said
one
of
the
men
patting
roger
shoulder
it
was
through
him
that
we
found
you
do
you
wish
to
know
how
well
about
three
it
was
maybe
a
little
earlier
maybe
a
little
later
my
wife
woke
me
up
you
hear
that
she
said
i
listened
and
heard
a
horse
in
the
lane
before
the
door
neighing
i
ca
tell
you
exactly
how
it
was
as
though
he
would
call
up
the
house
it
was
rather
queer
i
thought
so
i
got
up
and
looked
out
of
the
window
and
it
seemed
to
me
he
had
a
saddle
on
he
stamped
and
pawed
and
then
he
gave
another
neigh
and
stamped
again
said
i
to
my
wife
is
something
wrong
here
and
i
dressed
and
went
out
when
he
saw
me
he
acted
in
the
strangest
way
you
ever
saw
thought
i
if
ever
an
animal
wanted
to
speak
that
animal
does
when
i
tried
to
catch
him
he
shot
off
ran
down
the
lane
a
bit
and
then
came
back
acting
as
strangely
as
ever
i
went
into
the
house
and
woke
up
my
brother
here
and
we
saddled
our
horses
and
started
away
went
yours
ahead
stopping
every
minute
to
look
around
and
see
if
we
followed
when
we
came
to
the
water
i
rather
hesitated
but
it
was
of
no
use
the
horse
would
have
us
go
on
and
on
till
we
found
you
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
before
in
all
my
life
gilbert
did
not
speak
but
two
large
tears
slowly
gathered
in
his
eyes
and
rolled
down
his
cheeks
the
men
saw
his
emotion
and
respected
it
in
the
light
of
the
cold
keen
dawn
they
reached
a
snug
farmhouse
a
mile
from
the
brandywine
the
men
lifted
gilbert
from
the
saddle
and
would
have
carried
him
immediately
into
the
house
but
he
first
leaned
upon
roger
neck
took
the
faithful
creature
head
in
his
arms
and
kissed
it
ground
or
reason
for
hoping

without

among

many
beautiful
stories
for

she
was

the
following
selection
is
adapted
from
little
men
she
died
in
one
would
have
said
that
modest
john
brooke
in
his
busy
quiet
humble
life
had
had
little
time
to
make
friends
but
now
they
seemed
to
start
up
everywhere
old
and
young
rich
and
poor
high
and
low
for
all
unconsciously
his
influence
had
made
itself
widely
felt
his
virtues
were
remembered
and
his
hidden
charities
rose
up
to
bless
him
the
group
about
his
coffin
was
a
far
more
eloquent
eulogy
than
any
that
man
could
utter
there
were
the
rich
men
whom
he
had
served
faithfully
for
years
the
poor
old
women
whom
he
cherished
with
his
little
store
in
memory
of
his
mother
the
wife
to
whom
he
had
given
such
happiness
that
death
could
not
mar
it
utterly
the
brothers
and
sisters
in
whose
hearts
he
had
made
a
place
forever
the
little
son
and
daughter
who
already
felt
the
loss
of
his
strong
arm
and
tender
voice
the
young
children
sobbing
for
their
kindest
playmate
and
the
tall
lads
watching
with
softened
faces
a
scene
which
they
never
could
forget
that
evening
as
the
plumfield
boys
sat
on
the
steps
as
usual
in
the
mild
september
moonlight
they
naturally
fell
to
talking
of
the
event
of
the
day
emil
began
by
breaking
out
in
his
impetuous
way
uncle
fritz
is
the
wisest
and
uncle
laurie
the
jolliest
but
uncle
john
was
the
best
and
i
rather
be
like
him
than
any
man
i
ever
saw
so
would
i
did
you
hear
what
those
gentlemen
said
to
grandpa
i
would
like
to
have
that
said
of
me
when
i
was
dead
and
franz
felt
with
regret
that
he
had
not
appreciated
uncle
john
enough
what
did
they
say
asked
jack
who
had
been
much
impressed
by
the
scenes
of
the
day
why
one
of
the
partners
of
laurence
where
uncle
john
has
been
ever
so
long
was
saying
that
he
was
conscientious
almost
to
a
fault
as
a
business
man
and
above
reproach
in
all
things
another
gentleman
said
no
money
could
repay
the
fidelity
and
honesty
with
which
uncle
john
had
served
him
and
then
grandpa
told
them
the
best
of
all
uncle
john
once
had
a
place
in
the
office
of
a
man
who
cheated
and
when
this
man
wanted
uncle
to
help
him
do
it
uncle
would
though
he
was
offered
a
big
salary
the
man
was
angry
and
said
will
never
get
on
in
business
with
such
strict
principles
and
uncle
answered
back
never
will
try
to
get
on
without
them
and
left
the
place
for
a
much
harder
and
poorer
one
good
cried
several
of
the
boys
warmly
for
they
were
in
the
mood
to
understand
and
value
the
little
story
as
never
before
he
was
rich
was
he
asked
jack
no
he
never
did
anything
to
make
a
stir
in
the
world
did
he
no
he
was
only
good
that
all
and
franz
found
himself
wishing
that
uncle
john
had
done
something
to
boast
of
for
it
was
evident
that
jack
was
disappointed
by
his
replies
only
good
that
is
all
and
everything
said
uncle
fritz
who
had
overheard
the
last
few
words
and
guessed
what
was
going
on
in
the
minds
of
the
lads
let
me
tell
you
a
little
about
john
brooke
and
you
will
see
why
men
honor
him
and
why
he
was
satisfied
to
be
good
rather
than
rich
or
famous
he
simply
did
his
duty
in
all
things
and
did
it
so
cheerfully
so
faithfully
that
it
kept
him
patient
brave
and
happy
through
poverty
and
loneliness
and
years
of
hard
work
he
was
a
good
son
and
gave
up
his
own
plans
to
stay
and
live
with
his
mother
while
she
needed
him
he
was
a
good
friend
and
taught
your
uncle
laurie
much
beside
his
greek
and
latin
did
it
unconsciously
perhaps
by
showing
him
an
example
of
an
upright
man
he
was
a
faithful
servant
and
made
himself
so
valuable
to
those
who
employed
him
that
they
will
find
it
hard
to
fill
his
place
he
was
a
good
husband
and
father
so
tender
wise
and
thoughtful
that
laurie
and
i
learned
much
of
him
and
only
knew
how
well
he
loved
his
family
when
we
discovered
all
he
had
done
for
them
unsuspected
and
unassisted
uncle
fritz
stopped
a
minute
and
the
boys
sat
like
statues
in
the
moonlight
until
he
went
on
again
in
a
subdued
and
earnest
voice
as
he
lay
dying
i
said
to
him
no
care
for
your
wife
and
the
little
ones
i
will
see
that
they
never
want
then
he
smiled
and
pressed
my
hand
and
answered
in
his
cheerful
way
need
of
that
i
have
cared
for
them
and
so
he
had
for
when
we
looked
among
his
papers
all
was
in
order
not
a
debt
remained
and
safely
put
away
was
enough
to
keep
his
wife
comfortable
and
independent
then
we
knew
why
he
had
lived
so
plainly
denied
himself
so
many
pleasures
except
that
of
charity
and
worked
so
hard
that
i
fear
he
shortened
his
good
life
he
never
asked
help
for
himself
though
often
for
others
but
bore
his
own
burden
and
worked
out
his
own
task
bravely
and
quietly
no
one
can
say
a
word
of
complaint
against
him
so
just
and
generous
and
kind
was
he
and
now
when
he
is
gone
all
find
so
much
to
love
and
praise
and
honor
that
i
am
proud
to
have
been
his
friend
and
would
rather
leave
my
children
the
legacy
he
leaves
his
than
the
largest
fortune
ever
made
yes
simple
genuine
goodness

lxxxix
my
mother
grave
it
was
thirteen
years
since
my
mother
death
when
after
a
long
absence
from
my
native
village
i
stood
beside
the
sacred
mound
beneath
which
i
had
seen
her
buried
since
that
mournful
period
a
great
change
had
come
over
me
my
childish
years
had
passed
away
and
with
them
my
youthful
character
the
world
was
altered
too
and
as
i
stood
at
my
mother
grave
i
could
hardly
realize
that
i
was
the
same
thoughtless
happy
creature
whose
checks
she
so
often
kissed
in
an
excess
of
tenderness
but
the
varied
events
of
thirteen
years
had
not
effaced
the
remembrance
of
that
mother
smile
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
seen
her
but
yesterday
as
if
the
blessed
sound
of
her
voice
was
in
my
ear
the
gay
dreams
of
my
infancy
and
childhood
were
brought
back
so
distinctly
to
my
mind
that
had
it
not
been
for
one
bitter
recollection
the
tears
i
shed
would
have
been
gentle
and
refreshing
the
circumstance
may
seem
a
trifling
one
but
the
thought
of
it
now
pains
my
heart
and
i
relate
it
that
those
children
who
have
parents
to
love
them
may
learn
to
value
them
as
they
ought
my
mother
had
been
ill
a
long
time
and
i
had
become
so
accustomed
to
her
pale
face
and
weak
voice
that
i
was
not
frightened
at
them
as
children
usually
are
at
first
it
is
true
i
sobbed
violently
but
when
day
after
day
i
returned
from
school
and
found
her
the
same
i
began
to
believe
she
would
always
be
spared
to
me
but
they
told
me
she
would
die
one
day
when
i
had
lost
my
place
in
the
class
i
came
home
discouraged
and
fretful
i
went
to
my
mother
chamber
she
was
paler
than
usual
but
she
met
me
with
the
same
affectionate
smile
that
always
welcomed
my
return
alas
when
i
look
back
through
the
lapse
of
thirteen
years
i
think
my
heart
must
have
been
stone
not
to
have
been
melted
by
it
she
requested
me
to
go
downstairs
and
bring
her
a
glass
of
water
i
pettishly
asked
her
why
she
did
not
call
a
domestic
to
do
it
with
a
look
of
mild
reproach
which
i
shall
never
forget
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
she
said
will
not
my
daughter
bring
a
glass
of
water
for
her
poor
sick
mother
i
went
and
brought
her
the
water
but
i
did
not
do
it
kindly
instead
of
smiling
and
kissing
her
as
i
had
been
wont
to
do
i
set
the
glass
down
very
quickly
and
left
the
room
after
playing
a
short
time
i
went
to
bed
without
bidding
my
mother
good
night
but
when
alone
in
my
room
in
darkness
and
silence
i
remembered
how
pale
she
looked
and
how
her
voice
trembled
when
she
said
will
not
my
daughter
bring
a
glass
of
water
for
her
poor
sick
mother
i
could
not
sleep
i
stole
into
her
chamber
to
ask
forgiveness
she
had
sunk
into
an
easy
slumber
and
they
told
me
i
must
not
waken
her
i
did
not
tell
anyone
what
troubled
me
but
stole
back
to
my
bed
resolved
to
rise
early
in
the
morning
and
tell
her
how
sorry
i
was
for
my
conduct
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
when
i
awoke
and
hurrying
on
my
clothes
i
hastened
to
my
mother
chamber
she
was
dead
she
never
spoke
more
never
smiled
upon
me
again
and
when
i
touched
the
hand
that
used
to
rest
upon
my
head
in
blessing
it
was
so
cold
that
it
made
me
start
i
bowed
down
by
her
side
and
sobbed
in
the
bitterness
of
my
heart
i
then
wished
that
i
might
die
and
be
buried
with
her
and
old
as
i
now
am
i
would
give
worlds
were
they
mine
to
give
could
my
mother
but
have
lived
to
tell
me
she
forgave
my
childish
ingratitude
but
i
can
not
call
her
back
and
when
i
stand
by
her
grave
and
whenever
i
think
of
her
manifold
kindness
the
memory
of
that
reproachful
look
she
gave
me
will
bite
like
a
serpent
and
sting
like
an
adder
