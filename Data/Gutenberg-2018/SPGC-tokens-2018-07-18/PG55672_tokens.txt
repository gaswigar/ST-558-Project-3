men
i
m
not
married
to
no
matter
where
my
route
may
lie
no
matter
whither
i
repair
in
brief
no
matter
how
or
why
or
when
i
go
the
boys
are
there
on
lane
and
byways
street
and
square
on
alley
path
and
avenue
they
seem
to
spring
up
everywhere
the
men
i
am
not
married
to
i
watch
them
as
they
pass
me
by
at
each
in
wonderment
i
stare
and
but
for
heaven
s
grace
i
cry
there
goes
the
guy
whose
name
i
d
wear
they
represent
no
species
rare
they
walk
and
talk
as
others
do
they
re
fair
to
see
but
only
fair
the
men
i
am
not
married
to
i
m
sure
that
to
a
mother
s
eye
is
each
potentially
a
bear
but
though
at
home
they
rank
no
change
of
heart
could
i
declare
yet
worry
silvers
not
their
hair
they
deck
them
not
with
sprigs
of
rue
it
s
curious
how
they
do
not
care
the
men
i
am
not
married
to
l
envoi
in
fact
if
they
d
a
chance
to
share
their
lot
with
me
a
lifetime
through
they
d
doubtless
tender
me
the
air
the
men
i
am
not
married
to
freddie
oh
boy
people
say
of
freddie
you
just
ought
to
meet
him
some
time
he
s
a
riot
that
s
what
he
is
more
fun
than
a
other
and
more
imaginative
souls
play
whimsically
with
the
idea
and
say
that
he
is
more
fun
than
a
barrel
of
monkeys
still
others
go
at
the
thing
from
a
different
angle
and
refer
to
him
as
being
as
funny
as
a
crutch
but
i
always
feel
myself
that
they
stole
the
line
from
freddie
satire
that
is
his
dish
and
there
you
have
really
one
of
freddie
s
greatest
crosses
people
steal
his
stuff
right
and
left
he
will
say
something
one
day
and
the
next
it
will
be
as
good
as
all
over
the
city
time
after
time
i
have
gone
to
him
and
told
him
that
i
have
heard
lots
of
vaudeville
acts
using
his
comedy
but
he
just
puts
on
the
most
killing
expression
and
says
oh
say
not
suchly
in
that
way
of
his
and
of
course
it
gets
me
laughing
so
that
i
can
t
say
another
word
about
it
that
is
the
way
he
always
is
just
laughing
it
off
when
he
is
told
that
people
are
using
his
best
lines
without
even
so
much
as
word
of
acknowledgment
i
never
hear
any
one
say
there
is
such
a
thing
as
being
too
but
that
i
think
of
freddie
you
never
knew
any
one
like
him
on
a
party
things
will
be
dragging
along
the
way
they
do
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
with
the
early
arrivals
sitting
around
asking
one
another
have
they
been
to
anything
good
at
the
theatre
lately
and
is
it
any
wonder
there
is
so
much
sickness
around
with
the
weather
so
changeable
the
party
will
be
just
about
plucking
at
the
coverlet
when
in
will
breeze
freddie
and
from
that
moment
on
the
evening
is
little
short
of
a
whirlwind
often
and
often
i
have
heard
him
called
the
life
of
the
party
and
i
have
always
felt
that
there
is
not
the
least
bit
of
exaggeration
in
the
expression
what
i
envy
about
freddie
is
that
poise
of
his
he
can
come
right
into
a
room
full
of
strangers
and
be
just
as
much
at
home
as
if
he
had
gone
through
grammar
school
with
them
he
smashes
the
ice
all
to
nothing
the
moment
he
is
introduced
to
the
other
guests
by
pretending
to
misunderstand
their
names
and
calling
them
something
entirely
different
keeping
a
perfectly
straight
face
all
the
time
as
if
he
never
realized
there
was
anything
wrong
a
great
many
people
say
he
puts
them
in
mind
of
buster
keaton
that
way
he
is
never
at
a
loss
for
a
screaming
crack
if
the
hostess
asks
him
to
have
a
chair
freddie
comes
right
back
at
her
with
no
thanks
we
have
chairs
at
if
the
host
offers
him
a
cigar
he
will
say
just
like
a
flash
what
s
the
matter
with
it
if
one
of
the
men
borrows
a
cigarette
and
a
light
from
him
freddie
will
say
in
that
dry
voice
of
his
do
you
want
the
coupons
too
of
course
his
wit
is
pretty
fairly
caustic
but
no
one
ever
seems
to
take
offense
at
it
i
suppose
there
is
everything
in
the
way
he
says
things
and
he
is
practically
a
whole
vaudeville
show
in
himself
he
is
never
without
a
new
story
of
what
pat
said
to
mike
as
they
were
walking
down
the
street
or
how
abie
tried
to
cheat
ikie
or
what
old
aunt
jemima
answered
when
she
was
asked
why
she
had
married
for
the
fifth
time
freddie
does
them
in
dialect
and
i
have
often
thought
it
is
a
wonder
that
we
don
t
all
split
our
sides
and
never
a
selection
that
every
member
of
the
family
couldn
t
listen
to
either
just
healthy
fun
then
he
has
a
repertory
of
song
numbers
too
he
gives
them
without
accompaniment
and
every
song
has
a
virtually
unlimited
number
of
verses
after
each
one
of
which
freddie
goes
conscientiously
through
the
chorus
there
is
one
awfully
clever
one
a
big
favourite
of
his
with
the
chorus
rendered
a
different
way
each
time
showing
how
they
sang
it
when
grandma
was
a
girl
how
they
sing
it
in
gay
paree
and
how
a
cabaret
performer
would
do
it
then
there
are
several
along
the
general
lines
of
casey
jones
two
or
three
about
negroes
who
specialized
on
the
banjo
and
a
few
in
which
the
lyric
of
the
chorus
consists
of
the
syllables
ha
ha
the
idea
is
that
the
audience
will
get
laughing
along
with
the
singer
if
there
is
a
piano
in
the
house
freddie
can
tear
things
even
wider
open
there
may
be
many
more
accomplished
musicians
but
nobody
can
touch
him
as
far
as
being
ready
to
oblige
goes
there
is
never
any
of
this
hanging
back
waiting
to
be
coaxed
or
protesting
that
he
hasn
t
touched
a
key
in
months
he
just
sits
right
down
and
does
all
his
specialties
for
you
he
is
particularly
good
at
doing
dixie
with
one
hand
and
home
sweet
home
with
the
other
and
josef
hofmann
himself
can
t
tie
freddie
when
it
comes
to
giving
an
imitation
of
a
corps
approaching
passing
and
fading
away
in
the
distance
but
it
is
when
the
refreshments
are
served
that
freddie
reaches
the
top
of
his
form
he
always
insists
on
helping
to
pass
plates
and
glasses
and
when
he
gets
a
big
armful
of
them
he
pretends
to
stumble
it
is
as
good
as
a
play
to
see
the
hostess
face
then
he
tucks
his
napkin
into
his
collar
and
sits
there
just
as
solemnly
as
if
he
thought
that
were
the
thing
to
do
or
perhaps
he
will
vary
that
one
by
folding
the
napkin
into
a
little
square
and
putting
it
carefully
in
his
pocket
as
if
he
thought
it
was
a
handkerchief
you
just
ought
to
see
him
making
believe
that
he
has
swallowed
an
olive
pit
and
the
remarks
he
makes
about
the
food
i
do
wish
i
could
remember
how
they
go
he
is
funniest
though
it
seems
to
me
when
he
is
pretending
that
the
lemonade
is
intoxicating
and
that
he
feels
its
effects
pretty
strongly
when
you
have
seen
him
do
this
it
will
be
small
surprise
to
you
that
freddie
is
in
such
demand
for
social
functions
but
freddie
is
not
one
of
those
humourists
who
perform
only
when
out
in
society
all
day
long
he
is
bubbling
over
with
fun
and
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
he
is
not
a
mere
theorist
as
a
joker
practical
that
s
freddie
all
over
if
he
isn
t
sending
long
telegrams
collect
to
his
friends
then
he
is
sending
them
packages
of
useless
groceries
a
telephone
is
just
so
much
meat
to
him
i
don
t
believe
any
one
will
ever
know
how
much
fun
freddie
and
his
friends
get
out
of
freddie
s
calling
them
up
and
making
them
guess
who
he
is
when
he
really
wants
to
extend
himself
he
calls
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
says
that
he
is
the
wire
tester
he
uses
that
one
only
on
special
occasions
though
it
is
pretty
elaborate
for
everyday
use
but
day
in
and
day
out
you
can
depend
upon
it
that
he
is
putting
over
some
uproarious
trick
with
a
dribble
glass
or
a
loaded
cigar
or
a
pencil
with
a
rubber
point
and
you
can
feel
completely
sure
that
no
matter
where
he
is
or
how
unexpectedly
you
may
come
upon
him
freddie
will
be
right
there
with
a
funny
line
or
a
comparatively
new
story
for
you
that
is
what
people
marvel
over
when
they
are
talking
about
him
how
he
is
always
just
the
same
it
is
right
there
really
that
they
put
their
finger
on
the
big
trouble
with
him
but
you
just
ought
to
meet
freddie
sometime
he
s
a
riot
that
s
what
he
is
more
fun
than
a
circus
mortimer
mortimer
had
his
photograph
taken
in
his
dress
suit
raymond
so
long
as
you
keep
him
well
inland
raymond
will
never
give
any
trouble
but
when
he
gets
down
to
the
seashore
he
affects
a
bathing
suit
fitted
with
little
sleeves
on
wading
into
the
sea
he
leans
over
and
carefully
applies
handfuls
of
water
to
his
wrists
and
forehead
charlie
it
s
curious
but
no
one
seems
to
be
able
to
recall
what
charlie
used
to
talk
about
before
the
country
went
what
may
be
called
with
screaming
effect
dry
of
course
there
must
have
been
a
lot
of
unsatisfactory
weather
even
then
and
i
don
t
doubt
that
he
slipped
in
a
word
or
two
when
the
talk
got
around
to
the
insanity
of
the
styles
of
women
s
dress
but
though
i
have
taken
up
the
thing
in
a
serious
way
and
have
gone
about
among
his
friends
making
inquiries
i
can
not
seem
to
find
that
he
could
ever
have
got
any
farther
than
that
in
the
line
of
conversation
in
fact
he
must
have
been
one
of
those
strong
silent
men
in
the
old
days
those
who
have
not
seen
him
for
several
years
would
be
in
a
position
to
be
knocked
flat
with
a
feather
if
they
could
see
what
a
regular
little
chatterbox
charlie
has
become
say
what
you
will
about
prohibition
and
who
has
a
better
right
you
would
have
to
admit
if
you
knew
charlie
that
it
has
been
the
making
of
him
as
a
conversationalist
he
never
requires
his
audience
to
do
any
feeding
for
him
it
needs
no
careful
leading
around
of
the
subject
no
tactful
questions
no
allusions
to
get
him
nicely
loosened
up
all
you
have
to
do
is
say
good
evening
to
him
ask
him
how
everybody
over
at
his
house
is
getting
along
and
give
him
a
chair
though
this
last
is
not
essential
and
charlie
is
good
for
three
hours
straight
on
where
he
is
getting
it
how
much
he
has
to
pay
for
it
and
what
the
chances
are
of
his
getting
hold
of
a
couple
of
cases
of
genuine
along
around
the
middle
of
next
week
i
have
known
him
to
hold
entire
dinner
parties
spellbound
from
cocktails
to
finger
bowls
with
his
monologue
now
i
would
be
well
down
among
the
last
when
it
came
to
wanting
to
give
you
the
impression
that
charlie
has
been
picked
for
the
alcoholic
team
despite
the
wetness
of
his
conversation
he
is
just
a
nice
normal
conscientious
drinker
willing
to
take
it
or
let
it
alone
in
the
order
named
i
don
t
say
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
along
without
it
but
neither
do
i
say
that
he
doesn
t
get
along
perfectly
splendidly
with
it
i
don
t
think
i
ever
saw
any
one
who
could
get
as
much
fun
as
charlie
can
out
of
splitting
the
eighteenth
amendment
with
a
friend
there
is
a
glamour
of
vicarious
romance
about
him
you
gather
from
his
conversation
that
he
comes
into
daily
contact
with
any
number
of
picturesque
people
he
tells
about
a
friend
of
his
who
owns
three
untouched
bottles
of
the
last
absinth
to
come
into
the
country
or
a
lawyer
he
knows
one
of
whose
grateful
clients
sent
him
six
cases
of
champagne
in
addition
to
his
fee
or
a
man
he
met
who
had
to
move
to
the
country
in
order
to
have
room
for
his
scotch
charlie
has
no
end
of
anecdotes
about
the
interesting
women
he
meets
too
there
is
one
girl
he
often
dwells
on
who
if
you
only
give
her
time
can
get
you
little
bottles
of
chartreuse
each
containing
an
individual
drink
another
gifted
young
woman
friend
of
his
is
the
inventor
of
a
cocktail
in
which
you
mix
a
spoonful
of
orange
marmalade
yet
another
is
the
justly
proud
owner
of
a
pet
marmoset
which
becomes
the
prince
of
good
fellows
as
soon
as
you
have
fed
him
a
couple
of
teaspoonfuls
of
gin
it
is
the
next
best
thing
to
knowing
these
people
yourself
to
hear
charlie
tell
about
them
he
just
makes
them
live
it
is
wonderful
how
charlie
s
circle
of
acquaintances
has
widened
during
the
last
two
years
there
is
nothing
so
broadening
as
prohibition
among
his
new
friends
he
numbers
a
conductor
on
a
train
that
runs
down
from
montreal
and
a
young
man
who
owns
his
own
truck
and
a
group
of
chaps
who
work
in
drug
stores
and
i
don
t
know
how
many
proprietors
of
homey
little
restaurants
in
the
basements
of
brownstone
houses
some
of
them
have
turned
out
to
be
but
friends
unfortunately
there
was
one
young
man
whom
charlie
had
looked
upon
practically
as
a
brother
who
went
particularly
bad
on
him
it
seems
he
had
taken
a
pretty
solemn
oath
to
supply
charlie
as
a
personal
favour
with
a
case
of
real
gordon
which
he
said
he
was
able
to
get
through
his
high
social
connections
on
the
other
side
when
what
the
young
man
called
a
nominal
sum
was
paid
and
the
case
was
delivered
its
bottles
were
found
to
contain
a
nameless
liquor
though
those
of
charlie
s
friends
who
gave
it
a
fair
trial
suggested
storm
king
as
a
good
name
for
the
brand
charlie
has
never
laid
eyes
on
the
young
man
from
that
day
to
this
he
is
still
unable
to
talk
about
it
without
a
break
in
his
voice
as
he
says
and
quite
rightly
too
it
was
the
principle
of
the
thing
but
for
the
most
part
his
new
friends
are
just
the
truest
pals
a
man
ever
had
in
more
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
charlie
will
keep
you
right
abreast
with
them
sketch
in
for
you
how
they
are
and
what
they
are
doing
and
what
their
last
words
to
him
were
but
charlie
can
be
the
best
of
listeners
too
just
tell
him
about
any
little
formula
you
may
have
picked
up
for
making
it
at
home
and
you
will
find
the
most
sympathetic
of
audiences
and
one
who
will
even
go
to
the
flattering
length
of
taking
notes
on
your
discourse
relate
to
him
tales
of
unusual
places
where
you
have
heard
that
you
can
get
it
or
of
grotesque
sums
that
you
have
been
told
have
been
exchanged
for
it
and
he
will
hang
on
your
every
word
leading
you
on
asking
intelligent
questions
encouraging
you
by
references
to
like
experiences
of
his
own
but
don
t
let
yourself
get
carried
away
with
success
and
attempt
to
branch
out
into
other
topics
for
you
will
lose
charlie
in
a
minute
if
you
try
it
but
that
now
i
think
of
it
would
probably
be
the
very
idea
you
would
have
in
mind
lloyd
lloyd

washable
neckties
henry
you
would
really
be
surprised
at
the
number
of
things
that
henry
knows
just
a
shade
more
about
than
anybody
else
does
naturally
he
can
t
help
realizing
this
about
himself
but
you
mustn
t
think
for
a
minute
that
he
has
let
it
spoil
him
on
the
contrary
as
the
french
so
well
put
it
he
has
no
end
of
patience
with
others
and
he
is
always
willing
to
oversee
what
they
are
doing
and
to
offer
them
counsel
when
it
comes
to
giving
his
time
and
his
energy
there
is
nobody
who
could
not
admit
that
henry
is
generous
to
a
fault
i
have
even
heard
people
go
so
far
as
to
say
if
for
instance
henry
happens
to
drop
in
while
four
of
his
friends
are
struggling
along
through
a
game
of
bridge
he
does
not
cut
in
and
take
a
hand
thereby
showing
up
their
playing
in
comparison
to
his
no
henry
draws
up
a
chair
and
sits
looking
on
with
a
kindly
smile
of
course
now
and
then
he
can
not
restrain
a
look
of
pain
or
an
exclamation
of
surprise
or
even
a
burst
of
laughter
as
he
listens
to
the
bidding
but
he
never
interferes
frequently
after
a
card
has
been
played
he
will
lean
over
and
in
a
way
tell
the
player
what
he
should
have
done
instead
and
how
he
might
just
as
well
throw
his
hand
down
then
and
there
but
he
always
refuses
to
take
any
more
active
part
in
the
game
occasionally
when
a
uniquely
poisonous
play
is
made
i
have
seen
henry
thrust
his
chair
aside
and
pace
about
in
speechless
excitement
but
for
the
most
part
he
is
admirably
he
always
leaves
with
a
few
cheery
words
to
the
players
urging
them
to
keep
at
it
and
not
let
themselves
get
discouraged
and
that
is
the
way
henry
is
about
everything
he
will
stroll
over
to
a
tennis
court
and
stand
on
the
side
lines
at
what
i
am
sure
must
be
great
personal
inconvenience
calling
words
of
advice
and
suggestion
for
sets
at
a
stretch
i
have
even
known
him
to
follow
his
friends
all
the
way
around
a
golf
course
offering
constructive
criticism
on
their
form
as
he
goes
i
tell
you
in
this
day
and
generation
you
don
t
find
many
people
who
will
go
as
far
out
of
their
way
for
their
friends
as
henry
does
and
i
am
far
from
being
the
only
one
who
says
so
too
i
have
often
thought
that
henry
must
be
the
boy
who
got
up
the
idea
of
leaving
the
world
a
little
better
than
he
found
it
yet
he
never
crashes
in
on
his
friends
affairs
only
after
the
thing
is
done
does
he
point
out
to
you
how
it
could
have
been
done
just
a
dash
better
after
you
have
signed
the
lease
for
the
new
apartment
henry
tells
you
where
you
could
have
got
one
cheaper
and
sunnier
after
you
are
all
tied
up
with
the
new
firm
henry
explains
to
you
where
you
made
your
big
mistake
in
leaving
the
old
one
it
is
never
any
news
to
me
when
i
hear
people
telling
henry
that
he
knows
more
about
more
things
than
anybody
they
ever
saw
in
their
lives
and
i
don
t
remember
ever
having
heard
henry
give
them
any
argument
on
that
one
joe
after
joe
had
had
two
cocktails
he
wanted
to
go
up
and
bat
for
the
trap
drummer
after
he
had
had
three
he
began
to
get
personal
about
the
unattractive
shade
of
the
necktie
worn
by
the
strange
man
at
the
next
table
oliver
oliver
had
a
way
of
dragging
his
mouth
to
one
side
by
means
of
an
inserted
forefinger
explaining
to
you
meanwhile
in
necessarily
obscured
tones
the
work
which
his
dentist
had
just
accomplished
on
his
generously
displayed
back
teeth
albert

powdered
sugar
on
his
sliced
tomatoes
