sara
crewe
or
what
happened
at
miss
by
frances
hodgson
burnett
in
the
first
place
miss
minchin
lived
in
london
her
home
was
a
large
dull
tall
one
in
a
large
dull
square
where
all
the
houses
were
alike
and
all
the
sparrows
were
alike
and
where
all
the
made
the
same
heavy
sound
and
on
still
days
and
nearly
all
the
days
were
still
seemed
to
resound
through
the
entire
row
in
which
the
knock
was
knocked
on
miss
minchin
door
there
was
a
brass
plate
on
the
brass
plate
there
was
inscribed
in
black
letters
miss
select
seminary
for
young
ladies
little
sara
crewe
never
went
in
or
out
of
the
house
without
reading
that
and
reflecting
upon
it
by
the
time
she
was
twelve
she
had
decided
that
all
her
trouble
arose
because
in
the
first
place
she
was
not
select
and
in
the
second
she
was
not
a
young
when
she
was
eight
years
old
she
had
been
brought
to
miss
minchin
as
a
pupil
and
left
with
her
her
papa
had
brought
her
all
the
way
from
india
her
mamma
had
died
when
she
was
a
baby
and
her
papa
had
kept
her
with
him
as
long
as
he
could
and
then
finding
the
hot
climate
was
making
her
very
delicate
he
had
brought
her
to
england
and
left
her
with
miss
minchin
to
be
part
of
the
select
seminary
for
young
ladies
sara
who
had
always
been
a
sharp
little
child
who
remembered
things
recollected
hearing
him
say
that
he
had
not
a
relative
in
the
world
whom
he
knew
of
and
so
he
was
obliged
to
place
her
at
a
and
he
had
heard
miss
minchin
establishment
spoken
of
very
highly
the
same
day
he
took
sara
out
and
bought
her
a
great
many
beautiful
clothes
clothes
so
grand
and
rich
that
only
a
very
young
and
inexperienced
man
would
have
bought
them
for
a
mite
of
a
child
who
was
to
be
brought
up
in
a
but
the
fact
was
that
he
was
a
rash
innocent
young
man
and
very
sad
at
the
thought
of
parting
with
his
little
girl
who
was
all
he
had
left
to
remind
him
of
her
beautiful
mother
whom
he
had
dearly
loved
and
he
wished
her
to
have
everything
the
most
fortunate
little
girl
could
have
and
so
when
the
polite
saleswomen
in
the
shops
said
here
is
our
very
latest
thing
in
hats
the
plumes
are
exactly
the
same
as
those
we
sold
to
lady
diana
sinclair
yesterday
he
immediately
bought
what
was
offered
to
him
and
paid
whatever
was
asked
the
consequence
was
that
sara
had
a
most
extraordinary
wardrobe
her
dresses
were
silk
and
velvet
and
india
cashmere
her
hats
and
bonnets
were
covered
with
bows
and
plumes
her
small
undergarments
were
adorned
with
real
lace
and
she
returned
in
the
cab
to
miss
minchin
with
a
doll
almost
as
large
as
herself
dressed
quite
as
grandly
as
herself
too
then
her
papa
gave
miss
minchin
some
money
and
went
away
and
for
several
days
sara
would
neither
touch
the
doll
nor
her
breakfast
nor
her
dinner
nor
her
tea
and
would
do
nothing
but
crouch
in
a
small
corner
by
the
window
and
cry
she
cried
so
much
indeed
that
she
made
herself
she
was
a
queer
little
child
with
ways
and
strong
feelings
and
she
had
adored
her
papa
and
could
not
be
made
to
think
that
india
and
an
interesting
bungalow
were
not
better
for
her
than
london
and
miss
minchin
select
seminary
the
instant
she
had
entered
the
house
she
had
begun
promptly
to
hate
miss
minchin
and
to
think
little
of
miss
amelia
minchin
who
was
smooth
and
dumpy
and
lisped
and
was
evidently
afraid
of
her
older
sister
miss
minchin
was
tall
and
had
large
cold
fishy
eyes
and
large
cold
hands
which
seemed
fishy
too
because
they
were
damp
and
made
chills
run
down
sara
back
when
they
touched
her
as
miss
minchin
pushed
her
hair
off
her
forehead
and
said
a
most
beautiful
and
promising
little
girl
captain
crewe
she
will
be
a
favorite
pupil
quite
a
favorite
pupil
i
for
the
first
year
she
was
a
favorite
pupil
at
least
she
was
indulged
a
great
deal
more
than
was
good
for
her
and
when
the
select
seminary
went
walking
two
by
two
she
was
always
decked
out
in
her
grandest
clothes
and
led
by
the
hand
at
the
head
of
the
genteel
procession
by
miss
minchin
herself
and
when
the
parents
of
any
of
the
pupils
came
she
was
always
dressed
and
called
into
the
parlor
with
her
doll
and
she
used
to
hear
miss
minchin
say
that
her
father
was
a
distinguished
indian
officer
and
she
would
be
heiress
to
a
great
fortune
that
her
father
had
inherited
a
great
deal
of
money
sara
had
heard
before
and
also
that
some
day
it
would
be
hers
and
that
he
would
not
remain
long
in
the
army
but
would
come
to
live
in
london
and
every
time
a
letter
came
she
hoped
it
would
say
he
was
coming
and
they
were
to
live
together
again
but
about
the
middle
of
the
third
year
a
letter
came
bringing
very
different
news
because
he
was
not
a
business
man
himself
her
papa
had
given
his
affairs
into
the
hands
of
a
friend
he
trusted
the
friend
had
deceived
and
robbed
him
all
the
money
was
gone
no
one
knew
exactly
where
and
the
shock
was
so
great
to
the
poor
rash
young
officer
that
being
attacked
by
jungle
fever
shortly
afterward
he
had
no
strength
to
rally
and
so
died
leaving
sara
with
no
one
to
take
care
of
her
miss
minchin
cold
and
fishy
eyes
had
never
looked
so
cold
and
fishy
as
they
did
when
sara
went
into
the
parlor
on
being
sent
for
a
few
days
after
the
letter
was
received
no
one
had
said
anything
to
the
child
about
mourning
so
in
her
way
she
had
decided
to
find
a
black
dress
for
herself
and
had
picked
out
a
black
velvet
she
had
outgrown
and
came
into
the
room
in
it
looking
the
queerest
little
figure
in
the
world
and
a
sad
little
figure
too
the
dress
was
too
short
and
too
tight
her
face
was
white
her
eyes
had
dark
rings
around
them
and
her
doll
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
old
black
crape
was
held
under
her
arm
she
was
not
a
pretty
child
she
was
thin
and
had
a
weird
interesting
little
face
short
black
hair
and
very
large
eyes
fringed
all
around
with
heavy
black
lashes
i
am
the
ugliest
child
in
the
school
she
had
said
once
after
staring
at
herself
in
the
glass
for
some
minutes
but
there
had
been
a
clever
little
french
teacher
who
had
said
to
the
zat
leetle
crewe
vat
a
child
a
so
ogly
beauty
ze
so
large
eyes
ze
so
little
spirituelle
face
waid
till
she
grow
up
you
shall
see
this
morning
however
in
the
tight
small
black
frock
she
looked
thinner
and
odder
than
ever
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
miss
minchin
with
a
queer
steadiness
as
she
slowly
advanced
into
the
parlor
clutching
her
doll
put
your
doll
down
said
miss
minchin
no
said
the
child
i
wo
put
her
down
i
want
her
with
me
she
is
all
i
have
she
has
stayed
with
me
all
the
time
since
my
papa
she
had
never
been
an
obedient
child
she
had
had
her
own
way
ever
since
she
was
born
and
there
was
about
her
an
air
of
silent
determination
under
which
miss
minchin
had
always
felt
secretly
uncomfortable
and
that
lady
felt
even
now
that
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
not
to
insist
on
her
point
so
she
looked
at
her
as
severely
as
possible
you
will
have
no
time
for
dolls
in
future
she
said
you
will
have
to
work
and
improve
yourself
and
make
yourself
sara
kept
the
big
odd
eyes
fixed
on
her
teacher
and
said
nothing
everything
will
be
very
different
now
miss
minchin
went
on
i
sent
for
you
to
talk
to
you
and
make
you
understand
your
father
is
dead
you
have
no
friends
you
have
no
money
you
have
no
home
and
no
one
to
take
care
of
the
little
pale
olive
face
twitched
nervously
but
the
eyes
did
not
move
from
miss
minchin
and
still
sara
said
nothing
what
are
you
staring
at
demanded
miss
minchin
sharply
are
you
so
stupid
you
do
understand
what
i
mean
i
tell
you
that
you
are
quite
alone
in
the
world
and
have
no
one
to
do
anything
for
you
unless
i
choose
to
keep
you
the
truth
was
miss
minchin
was
in
her
worst
mood
to
be
suddenly
deprived
of
a
large
sum
of
money
yearly
and
a
show
pupil
and
to
find
herself
with
a
little
beggar
on
her
hands
was
more
than
she
could
bear
with
any
degree
of
calmness
now
listen
to
me
she
went
on
and
remember
what
i
say
if
you
work
hard
and
prepare
to
make
yourself
useful
in
a
few
years
i
shall
let
you
stay
here
you
are
only
a
child
but
you
are
a
sharp
child
and
you
pick
up
things
almost
without
being
taught
you
speak
french
very
well
and
in
a
year
or
so
you
can
begin
to
help
with
the
younger
pupils
by
the
time
you
are
fifteen
you
ought
to
be
able
to
do
that
much
at
i
can
speak
french
better
than
you
now
said
sara
i
always
spoke
it
with
my
papa
in
which
was
not
at
all
polite
but
was
painfully
true
because
miss
minchin
could
not
speak
french
at
all
and
indeed
was
not
in
the
least
a
clever
person
but
she
was
a
hard
grasping
business
woman
and
after
the
first
shock
of
disappointment
had
seen
that
at
very
little
expense
to
herself
she
might
prepare
this
clever
determined
child
to
be
very
useful
to
her
and
save
her
the
necessity
of
paying
large
salaries
to
teachers
of
languages
do
be
impudent
or
you
will
be
punished
she
said
you
will
have
to
improve
your
manners
if
you
expect
to
earn
your
bread
you
are
not
a
parlor
boarder
now
remember
that
if
you
do
please
me
and
i
send
you
away
you
have
no
home
but
the
street
you
can
go
sara
turned
away
stay
commanded
miss
minchin
do
you
intend
to
thank
me
sara
turned
toward
her
the
nervous
twitch
was
to
be
seen
again
in
her
face
and
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
control
it
what
for
she
said
for
my
kindness
to
you
replied
miss
minchin
for
my
kindness
in
giving
you
a
sara
went
two
or
three
steps
nearer
to
her
her
thin
little
chest
was
heaving
up
and
down
and
she
spoke
in
a
strange
unchildish
voice
you
are
not
kind
she
said
you
are
not
and
she
turned
again
and
went
out
of
the
room
leaving
miss
minchin
staring
after
her
strange
small
figure
in
stony
anger
the
child
walked
up
the
staircase
holding
tightly
to
her
doll
she
meant
to
go
to
her
bedroom
but
at
the
door
she
was
met
by
miss
amelia
you
are
not
to
go
in
there
she
said
that
is
not
your
room
where
is
my
room
asked
sara
you
are
to
sleep
in
the
attic
next
to
the
sara
walked
on
she
mounted
two
flights
more
and
reached
the
door
of
the
attic
room
opened
it
and
went
in
shutting
it
behind
her
she
stood
against
it
and
looked
about
her
the
room
was
and
whitewashed
there
was
a
rusty
grate
an
iron
bedstead
and
some
odd
articles
of
furniture
sent
up
from
better
rooms
below
where
they
had
been
used
until
they
were
considered
to
be
worn
out
under
the
skylight
in
the
roof
which
showed
nothing
but
an
oblong
piece
of
dull
gray
sky
there
was
a
battered
old
red
footstool
sara
went
to
it
and
sat
down
she
was
a
queer
child
as
i
have
said
before
and
quite
unlike
other
children
she
seldom
cried
she
did
not
cry
now
she
laid
her
doll
emily
across
her
knees
and
put
her
face
down
upon
her
and
her
arms
around
her
and
sat
there
her
little
black
head
resting
on
the
black
crape
not
saying
one
word
not
making
one
sound
from
that
day
her
life
changed
entirely
sometimes
she
used
to
feel
as
if
it
must
be
another
life
altogether
the
life
of
some
other
child
she
was
a
little
drudge
and
outcast
she
was
given
her
lessons
at
odd
times
and
expected
to
learn
without
being
taught
she
was
sent
on
errands
by
miss
minchin
miss
amelia
and
the
cook
nobody
took
any
notice
of
her
except
when
they
ordered
her
about
she
was
often
kept
busy
all
day
and
then
sent
into
the
deserted
with
a
pile
of
books
to
learn
her
lessons
or
practise
at
night
she
had
never
been
intimate
with
the
other
pupils
and
soon
she
became
so
shabby
that
taking
her
queer
clothes
together
with
her
queer
little
ways
they
began
to
look
upon
her
as
a
being
of
another
world
than
their
own
the
fact
was
that
as
a
rule
miss
minchin
pupils
were
rather
dull
young
people
accustomed
to
being
rich
and
comfortable
and
sara
with
her
elfish
cleverness
her
desolate
life
and
her
odd
habit
of
fixing
her
eyes
upon
them
and
staring
them
out
of
countenance
was
too
much
for
them
she
always
looks
as
if
she
was
finding
you
out
said
one
girl
who
was
sly
and
given
to
making
mischief
i
am
said
sara
promptly
when
she
heard
of
it
that
what
i
look
at
them
for
i
like
to
know
about
people
i
think
them
over
she
never
made
any
mischief
herself
or
interfered
with
any
one
she
talked
very
little
did
as
she
was
told
and
thought
a
great
deal
nobody
knew
and
in
fact
nobody
cared
whether
she
was
unhappy
or
happy
unless
perhaps
it
was
emily
who
lived
in
the
attic
and
slept
on
the
iron
bedstead
at
night
sara
thought
emily
understood
her
feelings
though
she
was
only
wax
and
had
a
habit
of
staring
herself
sara
used
to
talk
to
her
at
night
you
are
the
only
friend
i
have
in
the
world
she
would
say
to
her
why
do
you
say
something
why
do
you
speak
sometimes
i
am
sure
you
could
if
you
would
try
it
ought
to
make
you
try
to
know
you
are
the
only
thing
i
have
if
i
were
you
i
should
try
why
do
you
try
it
really
was
a
very
strange
feeling
she
had
about
emily
it
arose
from
her
being
so
desolate
she
did
not
like
to
own
to
herself
that
her
only
friend
her
only
companion
could
feel
and
hear
nothing
she
wanted
to
believe
or
to
pretend
to
believe
that
emily
understood
and
sympathized
with
her
that
she
heard
her
even
though
she
did
not
speak
in
answer
she
used
to
put
her
in
a
chair
sometimes
and
sit
opposite
to
her
on
the
old
red
footstool
and
stare
at
her
and
think
and
pretend
about
her
until
her
own
eyes
would
grow
large
with
something
which
was
almost
like
fear
particularly
at
night
when
the
garret
was
so
still
when
the
only
sound
that
was
to
be
heard
was
the
occasional
squeak
and
scurry
of
rats
in
the
wainscot
there
were
in
the
garret
and
sara
detested
rats
and
was
always
glad
emily
was
with
her
when
she
heard
their
hateful
squeak
and
rush
and
scratching
one
of
her
pretends
was
that
emily
was
a
kind
of
good
witch
and
could
protect
her
poor
little
sara
everything
was
pretend
with
her
she
had
a
strong
imagination
there
was
almost
more
imagination
than
there
was
sara
and
her
whole
forlorn
was
made
up
of
imaginings
she
imagined
and
pretended
things
until
she
almost
believed
them
and
she
would
scarcely
have
been
surprised
at
any
remarkable
thing
that
could
have
happened
so
she
insisted
to
herself
that
emily
understood
all
about
her
troubles
and
was
really
her
friend
as
to
answering
she
used
to
say
i
do
answer
very
often
i
never
answer
when
i
can
help
it
when
people
are
insulting
you
there
is
nothing
so
good
for
them
as
not
to
say
a
word
just
to
look
at
them
and
think
miss
minchin
turns
pale
with
rage
when
i
do
it
miss
amelia
looks
frightened
so
do
the
girls
they
know
you
are
stronger
than
they
are
because
you
are
strong
enough
to
hold
in
your
rage
and
they
are
not
and
they
say
stupid
things
they
wish
they
had
said
afterward
nothing
so
strong
as
rage
except
what
makes
you
hold
it
in
stronger
it
a
good
thing
not
to
answer
your
enemies
i
scarcely
ever
do
perhaps
emily
is
more
like
me
than
i
am
like
myself
perhaps
she
would
rather
not
answer
her
friends
even
she
keeps
it
all
in
her
but
though
she
tried
to
satisfy
herself
with
these
arguments
sara
did
not
find
it
easy
when
after
a
long
hard
day
in
which
she
had
been
sent
here
and
there
sometimes
on
long
errands
through
wind
and
cold
and
rain
and
when
she
came
in
wet
and
hungry
had
been
sent
out
again
because
nobody
chose
to
remember
that
she
was
only
a
child
and
that
her
thin
little
legs
might
be
tired
and
her
small
body
clad
in
its
forlorn
too
small
finery
all
too
short
and
too
tight
might
be
chilled
when
she
had
been
given
only
harsh
words
and
cold
slighting
looks
for
thanks
when
the
cook
had
been
vulgar
and
insolent
when
miss
minchin
had
been
in
her
worst
moods
and
when
she
had
seen
the
girls
sneering
at
her
among
themselves
and
making
fun
of
her
poor
outgrown
clothes
then
sara
did
not
find
emily
quite
all
that
her
sore
proud
desolate
little
heart
needed
as
the
doll
sat
in
her
little
old
chair
and
stared
one
of
these
nights
when
she
came
up
to
the
garret
cold
hungry
tired
and
with
a
tempest
raging
in
her
small
breast
emily
stare
seemed
so
vacant
her
sawdust
legs
and
arms
so
limp
and
inexpressive
that
sara
lost
all
control
over
herself
i
shall
die
presently
she
said
at
first
emily
stared
i
ca
bear
this
said
the
poor
child
trembling
i
know
i
shall
die
i
cold
i
wet
i
starving
to
death
i
walked
a
thousand
miles
and
they
have
done
nothing
but
scold
me
from
morning
until
night
and
because
i
could
not
find
that
last
thing
they
sent
me
for
they
would
not
give
me
any
supper
some
men
laughed
at
me
because
my
old
shoes
made
me
slip
down
in
the
mud
i
covered
with
mud
now
and
they
laughed
do
you
hear
she
looked
at
the
staring
glass
eyes
and
complacent
wax
face
and
suddenly
a
sort
of
heartbroken
rage
seized
her
she
lifted
her
little
savage
hand
and
knocked
emily
off
the
chair
bursting
into
a
passion
of
sobbing
you
are
nothing
but
a
doll
she
cried
nothing
but
a
you
care
for
nothing
you
are
stuffed
with
sawdust
you
never
had
a
heart
nothing
could
ever
make
you
feel
you
are
a
doll
emily
lay
upon
the
floor
with
her
legs
ignominiously
doubled
up
over
her
head
and
a
new
flat
place
on
the
end
of
her
nose
but
she
was
still
calm
even
dignified
sara
hid
her
face
on
her
arms
and
sobbed
some
rats
in
the
wall
began
to
fight
and
bite
each
other
and
squeak
and
scramble
but
as
i
have
already
intimated
sara
was
not
in
the
habit
of
crying
after
a
while
she
stopped
and
when
she
stopped
she
looked
at
emily
who
seemed
to
be
gazing
at
her
around
the
side
of
one
ankle
and
actually
with
a
kind
of
sympathy
sara
bent
and
picked
her
up
remorse
overtook
her
you
ca
help
being
a
doll
she
said
with
a
resigned
sigh
any
more
than
those
girls
downstairs
can
help
not
having
any
sense
we
are
not
all
alike
perhaps
you
do
your
sawdust
none
of
miss
minchin
young
ladies
were
very
remarkable
for
being
brilliant
they
were
select
but
some
of
them
were
very
dull
and
some
of
them
were
fond
of
applying
themselves
to
their
lessons
sara
who
snatched
her
lessons
at
all
sorts
of
untimely
hours
from
tattered
and
discarded
books
and
who
had
a
hungry
craving
for
everything
readable
was
often
severe
upon
them
in
her
small
mind
they
had
books
they
never
read
she
had
no
books
at
all
if
she
had
always
had
something
to
read
she
would
not
have
been
so
lonely
she
liked
romances
and
history
and
poetry
she
would
read
anything
there
was
a
sentimental
housemaid
in
the
establishment
who
bought
the
weekly
penny
papers
and
subscribed
to
a
circulating
library
from
which
she
got
greasy
volumes
containing
stories
of
marquises
and
dukes
who
invariably
fell
in
love
with
and
gypsies
and
and
made
them
the
proud
brides
of
coronets
and
sara
often
did
parts
of
this
maid
work
so
that
she
might
earn
the
privilege
of
reading
these
romantic
histories
there
was
also
a
fat
dull
pupil
whose
name
was
ermengarde
john
who
was
one
of
her
resources
ermengarde
had
an
intellectual
father
who
in
his
despairing
desire
to
encourage
his
daughter
constantly
sent
her
valuable
and
interesting
books
which
were
a
continual
source
of
grief
to
her
sara
had
once
actually
found
her
crying
over
a
big
package
of
them
what
is
the
matter
with
you
she
asked
her
perhaps
rather
disdainfully
and
it
is
just
possible
she
would
not
have
spoken
to
her
if
she
had
not
seen
the
books
the
sight
of
books
always
gave
sara
a
hungry
feeling
and
she
could
not
help
drawing
near
to
them
if
only
to
read
their
titles
what
is
the
matter
with
you
she
asked
my
papa
has
sent
me
some
more
books
answered
ermengarde
woefully
and
he
expects
me
to
read
do
you
like
reading
said
sara
i
hate
it
replied
miss
ermengarde
john
and
he
will
ask
me
questions
when
he
sees
me
he
will
want
to
know
how
much
i
remember
how
would
you
like
to
have
to
read
all
those
i
like
it
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
said
sara
ermengarde
wiped
her
eyes
to
look
at
such
a
prodigy
oh
gracious
she
exclaimed
sara
returned
the
look
with
interest
a
sudden
plan
formed
itself
in
her
sharp
mind
look
here
she
said
if
you
lend
me
those
books
i
read
them
and
tell
you
everything
that
in
them
afterward
and
i
tell
it
to
you
so
that
you
will
remember
it
i
know
i
can
the
a
b
c
children
always
remember
what
i
tell
oh
goodness
said
ermengarde
do
you
think
you
could
i
know
i
could
answered
sara
i
like
to
read
and
i
always
remember
i
take
care
of
the
books
too
they
will
look
just
as
new
as
they
do
now
when
i
give
them
back
to
ermengarde
put
her
handkerchief
in
her
pocket
if
you
do
that
she
said
and
if
you
make
me
remember
give
you
i
give
you
some
i
do
want
your
money
said
sara
i
want
your
books
i
want
and
her
eyes
grew
big
and
queer
and
her
chest
heaved
once
take
them
then
said
ermengarde
i
wish
i
wanted
them
but
i
am
not
clever
and
my
father
is
and
he
thinks
i
ought
to
sara
picked
up
the
books
and
marched
off
with
them
but
when
she
was
at
the
door
she
stopped
and
turned
around
what
are
you
going
to
tell
your
father
she
asked
oh
said
ermengarde
he
need
know
he
think
i
read
sara
looked
down
at
the
books
her
heart
really
began
to
beat
fast
i
wo
do
it
she
said
rather
slowly
if
you
are
going
to
tell
him
lies
about
it
i
do
like
lies
why
ca
you
tell
him
i
read
them
and
then
told
you
about
them
but
he
wants
me
to
read
them
said
ermengarde
he
wants
you
to
know
what
is
in
them
said
sara
and
if
i
can
tell
it
to
you
in
an
easy
way
and
make
you
remember
i
should
think
he
would
like
he
would
like
it
better
if
i
read
them
myself
replied
ermengarde
he
will
like
it
i
dare
say
if
you
learn
anything
in
any
way
said
sara
i
should
if
i
were
your
and
though
this
was
not
a
flattering
way
of
stating
the
case
ermengarde
was
obliged
to
admit
it
was
true
and
after
a
little
more
argument
gave
in
and
so
she
used
afterward
always
to
hand
over
her
books
to
sara
and
sara
would
carry
them
to
her
garret
and
devour
them
and
after
she
had
read
each
volume
she
would
return
it
and
tell
ermengarde
about
it
in
a
way
of
her
own
she
had
a
gift
for
making
things
interesting
her
imagination
helped
her
to
make
everything
rather
like
a
story
and
she
managed
this
matter
so
well
that
miss
john
gained
more
information
from
her
books
than
she
would
have
gained
if
she
had
read
them
three
times
over
by
her
poor
stupid
little
self
when
sara
sat
down
by
her
and
began
to
tell
some
story
of
travel
or
history
she
made
the
travellers
and
historical
people
seem
real
and
ermengarde
used
to
sit
and
regard
her
dramatic
gesticulations
her
thin
little
flushed
cheeks
and
her
shining
odd
eyes
with
amazement
it
sounds
nicer
than
it
seems
in
the
book
she
would
say
i
never
cared
about
mary
queen
of
scots
before
and
i
always
hated
the
french
revolution
but
you
make
it
seem
like
a
it
is
a
story
sara
would
answer
they
are
all
stories
everything
is
a
story
everything
in
this
world
you
are
a
story
i
am
a
story
miss
minchin
is
a
story
you
can
make
a
story
out
of
i
ca
said
ermengarde
sara
stared
at
her
a
minute
reflectively
no
she
said
at
last
i
suppose
you
could
you
are
a
little
like
who
is
emily
sara
recollected
herself
she
knew
she
was
sometimes
rather
impolite
in
the
candor
of
her
remarks
and
she
did
not
want
to
be
impolite
to
a
girl
who
was
not
unkind
only
stupid
notwithstanding
all
her
sharp
little
ways
she
had
the
sense
to
wish
to
be
just
to
everybody
in
the
hours
she
spent
alone
she
used
to
argue
out
a
great
many
curious
questions
with
herself
one
thing
she
had
decided
upon
was
that
a
person
who
was
clever
ought
to
be
clever
enough
not
to
be
unjust
or
deliberately
unkind
to
any
one
miss
minchin
was
unjust
and
cruel
miss
amelia
was
unkind
and
spiteful
the
cook
was
malicious
and
they
all
were
stupid
and
made
her
despise
them
and
she
desired
to
be
as
unlike
them
as
possible
so
she
would
be
as
polite
as
she
could
to
people
who
in
the
least
deserved
politeness
emily
is
a
person
i
know
she
replied
do
you
like
her
asked
ermengarde
yes
i
do
said
sara
ermengarde
examined
her
queer
little
face
and
figure
again
she
did
look
odd
she
had
on
that
day
a
faded
blue
plush
skirt
which
barely
covered
her
knees
a
brown
cloth
sacque
and
a
pair
of
stockings
which
miss
minchin
had
made
her
piece
out
with
black
ones
so
that
they
would
be
long
enough
to
be
kept
on
and
yet
ermengarde
was
beginning
slowly
to
admire
her
such
a
forlorn
thin
neglected
little
thing
as
that
who
could
read
and
read
and
remember
and
tell
you
things
so
that
they
did
not
tire
you
all
out
a
child
who
could
speak
french
and
who
had
learned
german
no
one
knew
how
one
could
not
help
staring
at
her
and
feeling
interested
particularly
one
to
whom
the
simplest
lesson
was
a
trouble
and
a
woe
do
you
like
me
said
ermengarde
finally
at
the
end
of
her
scrutiny
sara
hesitated
one
second
then
she
answered
i
like
you
because
you
are
not
i
like
you
for
letting
me
read
your
books
i
like
you
because
you
do
make
spiteful
fun
of
me
for
what
i
ca
help
it
not
your
fault
that
she
pulled
herself
up
quickly
she
had
been
going
to
say
that
you
are
that
what
asked
ermengarde
that
you
ca
learn
things
quickly
if
you
ca
you
ca
if
i
can
why
i
can
that
she
paused
a
minute
looking
at
the
plump
face
before
her
and
then
rather
slowly
one
of
her
wise
thoughts
came
to
her
perhaps
she
said
to
be
able
to
learn
things
quickly
everything
to
be
kind
is
worth
a
good
deal
to
other
people
if
miss
minchin
knew
everything
on
earth
which
she
does
and
if
she
was
like
what
she
is
now
she
still
be
a
detestable
thing
and
everybody
would
hate
her
lots
of
clever
people
have
done
harm
and
been
wicked
look
at
robespierre
she
stopped
again
and
examined
her
companion
countenance
do
you
remember
about
him
she
demanded
i
believe
you
well
i
do
remember
all
of
it
admitted
ermengarde
well
said
sara
with
courage
and
determination
i
tell
it
to
you
over
and
she
plunged
once
more
into
the
gory
records
of
the
french
revolution
and
told
such
stories
of
it
and
made
such
vivid
pictures
of
its
horrors
that
miss
john
was
afraid
to
go
to
bed
afterward
and
hid
her
head
under
the
blankets
when
she
did
go
and
shivered
until
she
fell
asleep
but
afterward
she
preserved
lively
recollections
of
the
character
of
robespierre
and
did
not
even
forget
marie
antoinette
and
the
princess
de
lamballe
you
know
they
put
her
head
on
a
pike
and
danced
around
it
sara
had
said
and
she
had
beautiful
blonde
hair
and
when
i
think
of
her
i
never
see
her
head
on
her
body
but
always
on
a
pike
with
those
furious
people
dancing
and
yes
it
was
true
to
this
imaginative
child
everything
was
a
story
and
the
more
books
she
read
the
more
imaginative
she
became
one
of
her
chief
entertainments
was
to
sit
in
her
garret
or
walk
about
it
and
suppose
things
on
a
cold
night
when
she
had
not
had
enough
to
eat
she
would
draw
the
red
footstool
up
before
the
empty
grate
and
say
in
the
most
intense
voice
suppose
there
was
a
grate
wide
steel
grate
here
and
a
great
glowing
fire
a
glowing
fire
with
beds
of
coal
and
lots
of
little
dancing
flickering
flames
suppose
there
was
a
soft
deep
rug
and
this
was
a
comfortable
chair
all
cushions
and
crimson
velvet
and
suppose
i
had
a
crimson
velvet
frock
on
and
a
deep
lace
collar
like
a
child
in
a
picture
and
suppose
all
the
rest
of
the
room
was
furnished
in
lovely
colors
and
there
were
full
of
books
which
changed
by
magic
as
soon
as
you
had
read
them
and
suppose
there
was
a
little
table
here
with
a
cover
on
it
and
little
silver
dishes
and
in
one
there
was
hot
hot
soup
and
in
another
a
roast
chicken
and
in
another
some
tarts
with
crisscross
on
them
and
in
another
some
grapes
and
suppose
emily
could
speak
and
we
could
sit
and
eat
our
supper
and
then
talk
and
read
and
then
suppose
there
was
a
soft
warm
bed
in
the
corner
and
when
we
were
tired
we
could
go
to
sleep
and
sleep
as
long
as
we
sometimes
after
she
had
supposed
things
like
these
for
half
an
hour
she
would
feel
almost
warm
and
would
creep
into
bed
with
emily
and
fall
asleep
with
a
smile
on
her
face
what
large
downy
pillows
she
would
whisper
what
white
sheets
and
fleecy
blankets
and
she
almost
forgot
that
her
real
pillows
had
scarcely
any
feathers
in
them
at
all
and
smelled
musty
and
that
her
blankets
and
coverlid
were
thin
and
full
of
holes
at
another
time
she
would
suppose
she
was
a
princess
and
then
she
would
go
about
the
house
with
an
expression
on
her
face
which
was
a
source
of
great
secret
annoyance
to
miss
minchin
because
it
seemed
as
if
the
child
scarcely
heard
the
spiteful
insulting
things
said
to
her
or
if
she
heard
them
did
not
care
for
them
at
all
sometimes
while
she
was
in
the
midst
of
some
harsh
and
cruel
speech
miss
minchin
would
find
the
odd
unchildish
eyes
fixed
upon
her
with
something
like
a
proud
smile
in
them
at
such
times
she
did
not
know
that
sara
was
saying
to
herself
you
do
know
that
you
are
saying
these
things
to
a
princess
and
that
if
i
chose
i
could
wave
my
hand
and
order
you
to
execution
i
only
spare
you
because
i
am
a
princess
and
you
are
a
poor
stupid
old
vulgar
thing
and
do
know
any
this
used
to
please
and
amuse
her
more
than
anything
else
and
queer
and
fanciful
as
it
was
she
found
comfort
in
it
and
it
was
not
a
bad
thing
for
her
it
really
kept
her
from
being
made
rude
and
malicious
by
the
rudeness
and
malice
of
those
about
her
a
princess
must
be
polite
she
said
to
herself
and
so
when
the
servants
who
took
their
tone
from
their
mistress
were
insolent
and
ordered
her
about
she
would
hold
her
head
erect
and
reply
to
them
sometimes
in
a
way
which
made
them
stare
at
her
it
was
so
quaintly
civil
i
am
a
princess
in
rags
and
tatters
she
would
think
but
i
am
a
princess
inside
it
would
be
easy
to
be
a
princess
if
i
were
dressed
in
it
is
a
great
deal
more
of
a
triumph
to
be
one
all
the
time
when
no
one
knows
it
there
was
marie
antoinette
when
she
was
in
prison
and
her
throne
was
gone
and
she
had
only
a
black
gown
on
and
her
hair
was
white
and
they
insulted
her
and
called
her
the
widow
capet
she
was
a
great
deal
more
like
a
queen
then
than
when
she
was
so
gay
and
had
everything
grand
i
like
her
best
then
those
howling
mobs
of
people
did
not
frighten
her
she
was
stronger
than
they
were
even
when
they
cut
her
head
once
when
such
thoughts
were
passing
through
her
mind
the
look
in
her
eyes
so
enraged
miss
minchin
that
she
flew
at
sara
and
boxed
her
ears
sara
awakened
from
her
dream
started
a
little
and
then
broke
into
a
laugh
what
are
you
laughing
at
you
bold
impudent
child
exclaimed
miss
minchin
it
took
sara
a
few
seconds
to
remember
she
was
a
princess
her
cheeks
were
red
and
smarting
from
the
blows
she
had
received
i
was
thinking
she
said
beg
my
pardon
immediately
said
miss
minchin
i
will
beg
your
pardon
for
laughing
if
it
was
rude
said
sara
but
i
wo
beg
your
pardon
for
what
were
you
thinking
demanded
miss
minchin
how
dare
you
think
what
were
you
thinking
this
occurred
in
the
and
all
the
girls
looked
up
from
their
books
to
listen
it
always
interested
them
when
miss
minchin
flew
at
sara
because
sara
always
said
something
queer
and
never
seemed
in
the
least
frightened
she
was
not
in
the
least
frightened
now
though
her
boxed
ears
were
scarlet
and
her
eyes
were
as
bright
as
stars
i
was
thinking
she
answered
gravely
and
quite
politely
that
you
did
not
know
what
you
were
that
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
doing
miss
minchin
fairly
gasped
yes
said
sara
and
i
was
thinking
what
would
happen
if
i
were
a
princess
and
you
boxed
my
ears
what
i
should
do
to
you
and
i
was
thinking
that
if
i
were
one
you
would
never
dare
to
do
it
whatever
i
said
or
did
and
i
was
thinking
how
surprised
and
frightened
you
would
be
if
you
suddenly
found
out
she
had
the
imagined
picture
so
clearly
before
her
eyes
that
she
spoke
in
a
manner
which
had
an
effect
even
on
miss
minchin
it
almost
seemed
for
the
moment
to
her
narrow
unimaginative
mind
that
there
must
be
some
real
power
behind
this
candid
daring
what
she
exclaimed
found
out
what
that
i
really
was
a
princess
said
sara
and
could
do
anything
anything
i
go
to
your
room
cried
miss
minchin
breathlessly
this
instant
leave
the
attend
to
your
lessons
young
sara
made
a
little
bow
excuse
me
for
laughing
if
it
was
impolite
she
said
and
walked
out
of
the
room
leaving
miss
minchin
in
a
rage
and
the
girls
whispering
over
their
books
i
should
be
at
all
surprised
if
she
did
turn
out
to
be
something
said
one
of
them
suppose
she
should
that
very
afternoon
sara
had
an
opportunity
of
proving
to
herself
whether
she
was
really
a
princess
or
not
it
was
a
dreadful
afternoon
for
several
days
it
had
rained
continuously
the
streets
were
chilly
and
sloppy
there
was
mud
everywhere
sticky
london
mud
and
over
everything
a
pall
of
fog
and
drizzle
of
course
there
were
several
long
and
tiresome
errands
to
be
done
there
always
were
on
days
like
this
and
sara
was
sent
out
again
and
again
until
her
shabby
clothes
were
damp
through
the
absurd
old
feathers
on
her
forlorn
hat
were
more
draggled
and
absurd
than
ever
and
her
shoes
were
so
wet
they
could
not
hold
any
more
water
added
to
this
she
had
been
deprived
of
her
dinner
because
miss
minchin
wished
to
punish
her
she
was
very
hungry
she
was
so
cold
and
hungry
and
tired
that
her
little
face
had
a
pinched
look
and
now
and
then
some
person
passing
her
in
the
crowded
street
glanced
at
her
with
sympathy
but
she
did
not
know
that
she
hurried
on
trying
to
comfort
herself
in
that
queer
way
of
hers
by
pretending
and
supposing
but
really
this
time
it
was
harder
than
she
had
ever
found
it
and
once
or
twice
she
thought
it
almost
made
her
more
cold
and
hungry
instead
of
less
so
but
she
persevered
obstinately
suppose
i
had
dry
clothes
on
she
thought
suppose
i
had
good
shoes
and
a
long
thick
coat
and
merino
stockings
and
a
whole
umbrella
and
suppose
suppose
just
when
i
was
near
a
baker
where
they
sold
hot
buns
i
should
find
sixpence
which
belonged
to
nobody
suppose
if
i
did
i
should
go
into
the
shop
and
buy
six
of
the
hottest
buns
and
should
eat
them
all
without
some
very
odd
things
happen
in
this
world
sometimes
it
certainly
was
an
odd
thing
which
happened
to
sara
she
had
to
cross
the
street
just
as
she
was
saying
this
to
herself
the
mud
was
dreadful
she
almost
had
to
wade
she
picked
her
way
as
carefully
as
she
could
but
she
could
not
save
herself
much
only
in
picking
her
way
she
had
to
look
down
at
her
feet
and
the
mud
and
in
looking
down
just
as
she
reached
the
pavement
she
saw
something
shining
in
the
gutter
a
piece
of
silver
a
tiny
piece
trodden
upon
by
many
feet
but
still
with
spirit
enough
to
shine
a
little
not
quite
a
sixpence
but
the
next
thing
to
it
a
piece
in
one
second
it
was
in
her
cold
little
red
and
blue
hand
oh
she
gasped
it
is
true
and
then
if
you
will
believe
me
she
looked
straight
before
her
at
the
shop
directly
facing
her
and
it
was
a
baker
and
a
cheerful
stout
motherly
woman
with
rosy
cheeks
was
just
putting
into
the
window
a
tray
of
delicious
hot
buns
large
plump
shiny
buns
with
currants
in
them
it
almost
made
sara
feel
faint
for
a
few
seconds
the
shock
and
the
sight
of
the
buns
and
the
delightful
odors
of
warm
bread
floating
up
through
the
baker
she
knew
that
she
need
not
hesitate
to
use
the
little
piece
of
money
it
had
evidently
been
lying
in
the
mud
for
some
time
and
its
owner
was
completely
lost
in
the
streams
of
passing
people
who
crowded
and
jostled
each
other
all
through
the
day
but
i
go
and
ask
the
baker
woman
if
she
has
lost
a
piece
of
money
she
said
to
herself
rather
faintly
so
she
crossed
the
pavement
and
put
her
wet
foot
on
the
step
of
the
shop
and
as
she
did
so
she
saw
something
which
made
her
stop
it
was
a
little
figure
more
forlorn
than
her
own
a
little
figure
which
was
not
much
more
than
a
bundle
of
rags
from
which
small
bare
red
and
muddy
feet
peeped
out
only
because
the
rags
with
which
the
wearer
was
trying
to
cover
them
were
not
long
enough
above
the
rags
appeared
a
shock
head
of
tangled
hair
and
a
dirty
face
with
big
hollow
hungry
eyes
sara
knew
they
were
hungry
eyes
the
moment
she
saw
them
and
she
felt
a
sudden
sympathy
this
she
said
to
herself
with
a
little
sigh
is
one
of
the
populace
and
she
is
hungrier
than
i
the
child
this
one
of
the
populace
stared
up
at
sara
and
shuffled
herself
aside
a
little
so
as
to
give
her
more
room
she
was
used
to
being
made
to
give
room
to
everybody
she
knew
that
if
a
policeman
chanced
to
see
her
he
would
tell
her
to
move
sara
clutched
her
little
piece
and
hesitated
a
few
seconds
then
she
spoke
to
her
are
you
hungry
she
asked
the
child
shuffled
herself
and
her
rags
a
little
more
ai
i
jist
she
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
jist
ai
i
have
you
had
any
dinner
said
sara
no
dinner
more
hoarsely
still
and
with
more
shuffling
nor
yet
no
nor
yet
no
supper
nor
since
when
asked
sara
never
got
nothin
nowhere
i
axed
and
just
to
look
at
her
made
sara
more
hungry
and
faint
but
those
queer
little
thoughts
were
at
work
in
her
brain
and
she
was
talking
to
herself
though
she
was
sick
at
heart
if
i
a
princess
she
was
saying
if
i
a
princess
when
they
were
poor
and
driven
from
their
thrones
they
always
shared
with
the
populace
if
they
met
one
poorer
and
hungrier
they
always
shared
buns
are
a
penny
each
if
it
had
been
sixpence
i
could
have
eaten
six
it
wo
be
enough
for
either
of
us
but
it
will
be
better
than
wait
a
minute
she
said
to
the
she
went
into
the
shop
it
was
warm
and
smelled
delightfully
the
woman
was
just
going
to
put
more
hot
buns
in
the
window
if
you
please
said
sara
have
you
lost
fourpence
a
silver
fourpence
and
she
held
the
forlorn
little
piece
of
money
out
to
her
the
woman
looked
at
it
and
at
her
at
her
intense
little
face
and
draggled
clothes
bless
us
no
she
answered
did
you
find
it
in
the
gutter
said
sara
keep
it
then
said
the
woman
it
may
have
been
there
a
week
and
goodness
knows
who
lost
it
you
could
never
find
i
know
that
said
sara
but
i
thought
i
ask
not
many
would
said
the
woman
looking
puzzled
and
interested
and
all
at
once
do
you
want
to
buy
something
she
added
as
she
saw
sara
glance
toward
the
buns
four
buns
if
you
please
said
sara
those
at
a
penny
the
woman
went
to
the
window
and
put
some
in
a
paper
bag
sara
noticed
that
she
put
in
six
i
said
four
if
you
please
she
explained
i
have
only
the
i
throw
in
two
for
said
the
woman
with
her
look
i
dare
say
you
can
eat
them
some
time
are
you
hungry
a
mist
rose
before
sara
eyes
yes
she
answered
i
am
very
hungry
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
and
she
was
going
to
add
there
is
a
child
outside
who
is
hungrier
than
i
but
just
at
that
moment
two
or
three
customers
came
in
at
once
and
each
one
seemed
in
a
hurry
so
she
could
only
thank
the
woman
again
and
go
out
the
child
was
still
huddled
up
on
the
corner
of
the
steps
she
looked
frightful
in
her
wet
and
dirty
rags
she
was
staring
with
a
stupid
look
of
suffering
straight
before
her
and
sara
saw
her
suddenly
draw
the
back
of
her
roughened
black
hand
across
her
eyes
to
rub
away
the
tears
which
seemed
to
have
surprised
her
by
forcing
their
way
from
under
her
lids
she
was
muttering
to
herself
sara
opened
the
paper
bag
and
took
out
one
of
the
hot
buns
which
had
already
warmed
her
cold
hands
a
little
see
she
said
putting
the
bun
on
the
ragged
lap
that
is
nice
and
hot
eat
it
and
you
will
not
be
so
the
child
started
and
stared
up
at
her
then
she
snatched
up
the
bun
and
began
to
cram
it
into
her
mouth
with
great
wolfish
bites
oh
my
oh
my
sara
heard
her
say
hoarsely
in
wild
delight
oh
my
sara
took
out
three
more
buns
and
put
them
down
she
is
hungrier
than
i
am
she
said
to
herself
she
but
her
hand
trembled
when
she
put
down
the
fourth
bun
i
not
starving
she
said
and
she
put
down
the
fifth
the
little
starving
london
savage
was
still
snatching
and
devouring
when
she
turned
away
she
was
too
ravenous
to
give
any
thanks
even
if
she
had
been
taught
politeness
which
she
had
not
she
was
only
a
poor
little
wild
animal
said
sara
when
she
reached
the
other
side
of
the
street
she
looked
back
the
child
had
a
bun
in
both
hands
and
had
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
bite
to
watch
her
sara
gave
her
a
little
nod
and
the
child
after
another
stare
a
curious
longing
stare
jerked
her
shaggy
head
in
response
and
until
sara
was
out
of
sight
she
did
not
take
another
bite
or
even
finish
the
one
she
had
begun
at
that
moment
the
glanced
out
of
her
well
i
never
she
exclaimed
if
that
has
given
her
buns
to
a
it
was
because
she
did
want
them
either
well
well
she
looked
hungry
enough
i
give
something
to
know
what
she
did
it
she
stood
behind
her
window
for
a
few
moments
and
pondered
then
her
curiosity
got
the
better
of
her
she
went
to
the
door
and
spoke
to
the
who
gave
you
those
buns
she
asked
her
the
child
nodded
her
head
toward
sara
vanishing
figure
what
did
she
say
inquired
the
woman
axed
me
if
i
was
replied
the
hoarse
voice
what
did
you
say
said
i
was
jist
and
then
she
came
in
and
got
buns
and
came
out
and
gave
them
to
you
did
she
the
child
nodded
how
many
the
woman
thought
it
over
left
just
one
for
herself
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
she
could
have
eaten
the
whole
six
i
saw
it
in
her
she
looked
after
the
little
draggled
figure
and
felt
more
disturbed
in
her
usually
comfortable
mind
than
she
had
felt
for
many
a
day
i
wish
she
had
gone
so
quick
she
said
i
blest
if
she
have
had
a
then
she
turned
to
the
child
are
you
hungry
yet
she
asked
i
allus
was
the
answer
but
so
bad
as
it
come
in
here
said
the
woman
and
she
held
open
the
the
child
got
up
and
shuffled
in
to
be
invited
into
a
warm
place
full
of
bread
seemed
an
incredible
thing
she
did
not
know
what
was
going
to
happen
she
did
not
care
even
get
yourself
warm
said
the
woman
pointing
to
a
fire
in
a
tiny
back
room
and
look
here
when
you
hard
up
for
a
bite
of
bread
you
can
come
here
and
ask
for
it
i
blest
if
i
wo
give
it
to
you
for
that
young
un
sara
found
some
comfort
in
her
remaining
bun
it
was
hot
and
it
was
a
great
deal
better
than
nothing
she
broke
off
small
pieces
and
ate
them
slowly
to
make
it
last
longer
suppose
it
was
a
magic
bun
she
said
and
a
bite
was
as
much
as
a
whole
dinner
i
should
be
myself
if
i
went
on
like
it
was
dark
when
she
reached
the
square
in
which
miss
minchin
select
seminary
was
situated
the
lamps
were
lighted
and
in
most
of
the
windows
gleams
of
light
were
to
be
seen
it
always
interested
sara
to
catch
glimpses
of
the
rooms
before
the
shutters
were
closed
she
liked
to
imagine
things
about
people
who
sat
before
the
fires
in
the
houses
or
who
bent
over
books
at
the
tables
there
was
for
instance
the
large
family
opposite
she
called
these
people
the
large
family
not
because
they
were
large
for
indeed
most
of
them
were
little
but
because
there
were
so
many
of
them
there
were
eight
children
in
the
large
family
and
a
stout
rosy
mother
and
a
stout
rosy
father
and
a
stout
rosy
and
any
number
of
servants
the
eight
children
were
always
either
being
taken
out
to
walk
or
to
ride
in
perambulators
by
comfortable
nurses
or
they
were
going
to
drive
with
their
mamma
or
they
were
flying
to
the
door
in
the
evening
to
kiss
their
papa
and
dance
around
him
and
drag
off
his
overcoat
and
look
for
packages
in
the
pockets
of
it
or
they
were
crowding
about
the
nursery
windows
and
looking
out
and
pushing
each
other
and
laughing
in
fact
they
were
always
doing
something
which
seemed
enjoyable
and
suited
to
the
tastes
of
a
large
family
sara
was
quite
attached
to
them
and
had
given
them
all
names
out
of
books
she
called
them
the
montmorencys
when
she
did
not
call
them
the
large
family
the
fat
fair
baby
with
the
lace
cap
was
ethelberta
beauchamp
montmorency
the
next
baby
was
violet
cholmondely
montmorency
the
little
boy
who
could
just
stagger
and
who
had
such
round
legs
was
sydney
cecil
vivian
montmorency
and
then
came
lilian
evangeline
guy
clarence
maud
marian
rosalind
gladys
veronica
eustacia
and
claude
harold
hector
next
door
to
the
large
family
lived
the
maiden
lady
who
had
a
companion
and
two
parrots
and
a
king
charles
spaniel
but
sara
was
not
so
very
fond
of
her
because
she
did
nothing
in
particular
but
talk
to
the
parrots
and
drive
out
with
the
spaniel
the
most
interesting
person
of
all
lived
next
door
to
miss
minchin
herself
sara
called
him
the
indian
gentleman
he
was
an
elderly
gentleman
who
was
said
to
have
lived
in
the
east
indies
and
to
be
immensely
rich
and
to
have
something
the
matter
with
his
liver
in
fact
it
had
been
rumored
that
he
had
no
liver
at
all
and
was
much
inconvenienced
by
the
fact
at
any
rate
he
was
very
yellow
and
he
did
not
look
happy
and
when
he
went
out
to
his
carriage
he
was
almost
always
wrapped
up
in
shawls
and
overcoats
as
if
he
were
cold
he
had
a
native
servant
who
looked
even
colder
than
himself
and
he
had
a
monkey
who
looked
colder
than
the
native
servant
sara
had
seen
the
monkey
sitting
on
a
table
in
the
sun
in
the
parlor
window
and
he
always
wore
such
a
mournful
expression
that
she
sympathized
with
him
deeply
i
dare
say
she
used
sometimes
to
remark
to
herself
he
is
thinking
all
the
time
of
cocoanut
trees
and
of
swinging
by
his
tail
under
a
tropical
sun
he
might
have
had
a
family
dependent
on
him
too
poor
thing
the
native
servant
whom
she
called
the
lascar
looked
mournful
too
but
he
was
evidently
very
faithful
to
his
master
perhaps
he
saved
his
master
life
in
the
sepoy
rebellion
she
thought
they
look
as
if
they
might
have
had
all
sorts
of
adventures
i
wish
i
could
speak
to
the
lascar
i
remember
a
little
and
one
day
she
actually
did
speak
to
him
and
his
start
at
the
sound
of
his
own
language
expressed
a
great
deal
of
surprise
and
delight
he
was
waiting
for
his
master
to
come
out
to
the
carriage
and
sara
who
was
going
on
an
errand
as
usual
stopped
and
spoke
a
few
words
she
had
a
special
gift
for
languages
and
had
remembered
enough
hindustani
to
make
herself
understood
by
him
when
his
master
came
out
the
lascar
spoke
to
him
quickly
and
the
indian
gentleman
turned
and
looked
at
her
curiously
and
afterward
the
lascar
always
greeted
her
with
salaams
of
the
most
profound
description
and
occasionally
they
exchanged
a
few
words
she
learned
that
it
was
true
that
the
sahib
was
very
rich
that
he
was
ill
and
also
that
he
had
no
wife
nor
children
and
that
england
did
not
agree
with
the
monkey
he
must
be
as
lonely
as
i
am
thought
sara
being
rich
does
not
seem
to
make
him
that
evening
as
she
passed
the
windows
the
lascar
was
closing
the
shutters
and
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
room
inside
there
was
a
bright
fire
glowing
in
the
grate
and
the
indian
gentleman
was
sitting
before
it
in
a
luxurious
chair
the
room
was
richly
furnished
and
looked
delightfully
comfortable
but
the
indian
gentleman
sat
with
his
head
resting
on
his
hand
and
looked
as
lonely
and
unhappy
as
ever
poor
man
said
sara
i
wonder
what
you
are
when
she
went
into
the
house
she
met
miss
minchin
in
the
hall
where
have
you
wasted
your
time
said
miss
minchin
you
have
been
out
for
hours
it
was
so
wet
and
muddy
sara
answered
it
was
hard
to
walk
because
my
shoes
were
so
bad
and
slipped
about
make
no
excuses
said
miss
minchin
and
tell
no
sara
went
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
why
did
you
stay
all
night
said
the
cook
here
are
the
things
said
sara
and
laid
her
purchases
on
the
table
the
cook
looked
over
them
grumbling
she
was
in
a
very
bad
temper
indeed
may
i
have
something
to
eat
sara
asked
rather
faintly
tea
over
and
done
with
was
the
answer
did
you
expect
me
to
keep
it
hot
for
you
sara
was
silent
a
second
i
had
no
dinner
she
said
and
her
voice
was
quite
low
she
made
it
low
because
she
was
afraid
it
would
tremble
there
some
bread
in
the
pantry
said
the
cook
that
all
get
at
this
time
of
sara
went
and
found
the
bread
it
was
old
and
hard
and
dry
the
cook
was
in
too
bad
a
humor
to
give
her
anything
to
eat
with
it
she
had
just
been
scolded
by
miss
minchin
and
it
was
always
safe
and
easy
to
vent
her
own
spite
on
sara
really
it
was
hard
for
the
child
to
climb
the
three
long
flights
of
stairs
leading
to
her
garret
she
often
found
them
long
and
steep
when
she
was
tired
but
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
never
reach
the
top
several
times
a
lump
rose
in
her
throat
and
she
was
obliged
to
stop
to
rest
i
ca
pretend
anything
more
she
said
wearily
to
herself
i
sure
i
ca
i
eat
my
bread
and
drink
some
water
and
then
go
to
sleep
and
perhaps
a
dream
will
come
and
pretend
for
me
i
wonder
what
dreams
yes
when
she
reached
the
top
landing
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
she
did
not
feel
like
a
princess
only
like
a
tired
hungry
lonely
lonely
child
if
my
papa
had
lived
she
said
they
would
not
have
treated
me
like
this
if
my
papa
had
lived
he
would
have
taken
care
of
then
she
turned
the
handle
and
opened
the
can
you
imagine
it
can
you
believe
it
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
it
myself
and
sara
found
it
impossible
for
the
first
few
moments
she
thought
something
strange
had
happened
to
her
eyes
to
her
mind
that
the
dream
had
come
before
she
had
had
time
to
fall
asleep
oh
she
exclaimed
breathlessly
oh
it
is
true
i
know
i
know
it
is
true
and
she
slipped
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
and
locked
it
and
stood
with
her
back
against
it
staring
straight
before
her
do
you
wonder
in
the
grate
which
had
been
empty
and
rusty
and
cold
when
she
left
it
but
which
now
was
blackened
and
polished
up
quite
respectably
there
was
a
glowing
blazing
fire
on
the
hob
was
a
little
brass
kettle
hissing
and
boiling
spread
upon
the
floor
was
a
warm
thick
rug
before
the
fire
was
a
unfolded
and
with
cushions
on
it
by
the
chair
was
a
small
unfolded
covered
with
a
white
cloth
and
upon
it
were
spread
small
covered
dishes
a
cup
and
saucer
and
a
on
the
bed
were
new
warm
coverings
a
curious
wadded
silk
robe
and
some
books
the
little
cold
miserable
room
seemed
changed
into
fairyland
it
was
actually
warm
and
glowing
it
is
bewitched
said
sara
or
i
am
bewitched
i
only
think
i
see
it
all
but
if
i
can
only
keep
on
thinking
it
i
do
care
i
care
if
i
can
only
keep
it
up
she
was
afraid
to
move
for
fear
it
would
melt
away
she
stood
with
her
back
against
the
door
and
looked
and
looked
but
soon
she
began
to
feel
warm
and
then
she
moved
forward
a
fire
that
i
only
thought
i
saw
surely
would
feel
warm
she
said
it
feels
real
she
went
to
it
and
knelt
before
it
she
touched
the
chair
the
table
she
lifted
the
cover
of
one
of
the
dishes
there
was
something
hot
and
savory
in
it
something
delicious
the
had
tea
in
it
ready
for
the
boiling
water
from
the
little
kettle
one
plate
had
toast
on
it
another
muffins
it
is
real
said
sara
the
fire
is
real
enough
to
warm
me
i
can
sit
in
the
chair
the
things
are
real
enough
to
it
was
like
a
fairy
story
come
true
it
was
heavenly
she
went
to
the
bed
and
touched
the
blankets
and
the
wrap
they
were
real
too
she
opened
one
book
and
on
the
was
written
in
a
strange
hand
the
little
girl
in
the
suddenly
was
it
a
strange
thing
for
her
to
do
sara
put
her
face
down
on
the
queer
foreign
looking
quilted
robe
and
burst
into
tears
i
do
know
who
it
is
she
said
but
somebody
cares
about
me
a
little
somebody
is
my
somehow
that
thought
warmed
her
more
than
the
fire
she
had
never
had
a
friend
since
those
happy
luxurious
days
when
she
had
had
everything
and
those
days
had
seemed
such
a
long
way
off
so
far
away
as
to
be
only
like
dreams
during
these
last
years
at
miss
minchin
she
really
cried
more
at
this
strange
thought
of
having
a
friend
even
though
an
unknown
one
than
she
had
cried
over
many
of
her
worst
troubles
but
these
tears
seemed
different
from
the
others
for
when
she
had
wiped
them
away
they
did
not
seem
to
leave
her
eyes
and
her
heart
hot
and
smarting
and
then
imagine
if
you
can
what
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
like
the
delicious
comfort
of
taking
off
the
damp
clothes
and
putting
on
the
soft
warm
quilted
robe
before
the
glowing
fire
of
slipping
her
cold
feet
into
the
luscious
little
slippers
she
found
near
her
chair
and
then
the
hot
tea
and
savory
dishes
the
cushioned
chair
and
the
books
it
was
just
like
sara
that
once
having
found
the
things
real
she
should
give
herself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
them
to
the
very
utmost
she
had
lived
such
a
life
of
imagining
and
had
found
her
pleasure
so
long
in
improbabilities
that
she
was
quite
equal
to
accepting
any
wonderful
thing
that
happened
after
she
was
quite
warm
and
had
eaten
her
supper
and
enjoyed
herself
for
an
hour
or
so
it
had
almost
ceased
to
be
surprising
to
her
that
such
magical
surroundings
should
be
hers
as
to
finding
out
who
had
done
all
this
she
knew
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
she
did
not
know
a
human
soul
by
whom
it
could
seem
in
the
least
degree
probable
that
it
could
have
been
done
there
is
nobody
she
said
to
herself
she
discussed
the
matter
with
emily
it
is
true
but
more
because
it
was
delightful
to
talk
about
it
than
with
a
view
to
making
any
discoveries
but
we
have
a
friend
emily
she
said
we
have
a
sara
could
not
even
imagine
a
being
charming
enough
to
fill
her
grand
ideal
of
her
mysterious
benefactor
if
she
tried
to
make
in
her
mind
a
picture
of
him
or
her
it
ended
by
being
something
glittering
and
strange
not
at
all
like
a
real
person
but
bearing
resemblance
to
a
sort
of
eastern
magician
with
long
robes
and
a
wand
and
when
she
fell
asleep
beneath
the
soft
white
blanket
she
dreamed
all
night
of
this
magnificent
personage
and
talked
to
him
in
hindustani
and
made
salaams
to
him
upon
one
thing
she
was
determined
she
would
not
speak
to
any
one
of
her
good
fortune
it
should
be
her
own
secret
in
fact
she
was
rather
inclined
to
think
that
if
miss
minchin
knew
she
would
take
her
treasures
from
her
or
in
some
way
spoil
her
pleasure
so
when
she
went
down
the
next
morning
she
shut
her
door
very
tight
and
did
her
best
to
look
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
occurred
and
yet
this
was
rather
hard
because
she
could
not
help
remembering
every
now
and
then
with
a
sort
of
start
and
her
heart
would
beat
quickly
every
time
she
repeated
to
herself
i
have
a
friend
it
was
a
friend
who
evidently
meant
to
continue
to
be
kind
for
when
she
went
to
her
garret
the
next
night
and
she
opened
the
door
it
must
be
confessed
with
rather
an
excited
feeling
she
found
that
the
same
hands
had
been
again
at
work
and
had
done
even
more
than
before
the
fire
and
the
supper
were
again
there
and
beside
them
a
number
of
other
things
which
so
altered
the
look
of
the
garret
that
sara
quite
lost
her
breath
a
piece
of
bright
strange
heavy
cloth
covered
the
battered
mantel
and
on
it
some
ornaments
had
been
placed
all
the
bare
ugly
things
which
could
be
covered
with
draperies
had
been
concealed
and
made
to
look
quite
pretty
some
odd
materials
in
rich
colors
had
been
fastened
against
the
walls
with
sharp
fine
tacks
so
sharp
that
they
could
be
pressed
into
the
wood
without
hammering
some
brilliant
fans
were
pinned
up
and
there
were
several
large
cushions
a
long
old
wooden
box
was
covered
with
a
rug
and
some
cushions
lay
on
it
so
that
it
wore
quite
the
air
of
a
sofa
sara
simply
sat
down
and
looked
and
looked
again
it
is
exactly
like
something
fairy
come
true
she
said
there
the
least
difference
i
feel
as
if
i
might
wish
for
anything
diamonds
and
bags
of
gold
and
they
would
appear
that
could
be
any
stranger
than
this
is
this
my
garret
am
i
the
same
cold
ragged
damp
sara
and
to
think
how
i
used
to
pretend
and
pretend
and
wish
there
were
fairies
the
one
thing
i
always
wanted
was
to
see
a
fairy
story
come
true
i
am
living
in
a
fairy
story
i
feel
as
if
i
might
be
a
fairy
myself
and
be
able
to
turn
things
into
anything
else
it
was
like
a
fairy
story
and
what
was
best
of
all
it
continued
almost
every
day
something
new
was
done
to
the
garret
some
new
comfort
or
ornament
appeared
in
it
when
sara
opened
her
door
at
night
until
actually
in
a
short
time
it
was
a
bright
little
room
full
of
all
sorts
of
odd
and
luxurious
things
and
the
magician
had
taken
care
that
the
child
should
not
be
hungry
and
that
she
should
have
as
many
books
as
she
could
read
when
she
left
the
room
in
the
morning
the
remains
of
her
supper
were
on
the
table
and
when
she
returned
in
the
evening
the
magician
had
removed
them
and
left
another
nice
little
meal
downstairs
miss
minchin
was
as
cruel
and
insulting
as
ever
miss
amelia
was
as
peevish
and
the
servants
were
as
vulgar
sara
was
sent
on
errands
and
scolded
and
driven
hither
and
thither
but
somehow
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
bear
it
all
the
delightful
sense
of
romance
and
mystery
lifted
her
above
the
cook
temper
and
malice
the
comfort
she
enjoyed
and
could
always
look
forward
to
was
making
her
stronger
if
she
came
home
from
her
errands
wet
and
tired
she
knew
she
would
soon
be
warm
after
she
had
climbed
the
stairs
in
a
few
weeks
she
began
to
look
less
thin
a
little
color
came
into
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
did
not
seem
much
too
big
for
her
face
it
was
just
when
this
was
beginning
to
be
so
apparent
that
miss
minchin
sometimes
stared
at
her
questioningly
that
another
wonderful
thing
happened
a
man
came
to
the
door
and
left
several
parcels
all
were
addressed
in
large
letters
to
the
little
girl
in
the
sara
herself
was
sent
to
open
the
door
and
she
took
them
in
she
laid
the
two
largest
parcels
down
on
the
and
was
looking
at
the
address
when
miss
minchin
came
down
the
stairs
take
the
things
upstairs
to
the
young
lady
to
whom
they
belong
she
said
do
stand
there
staring
at
they
belong
to
me
answered
sara
quietly
to
you
exclaimed
miss
minchin
what
do
you
mean
i
do
know
where
they
came
from
said
sara
but
they
addressed
to
miss
minchin
came
to
her
side
and
looked
at
them
with
an
excited
expression
what
is
in
them
she
demanded
i
do
know
said
sara
open
them
she
demanded
still
more
excitedly
sara
did
as
she
was
told
they
contained
pretty
and
comfortable
clothing
clothing
of
different
kinds
shoes
and
stockings
and
gloves
a
warm
coat
and
even
an
umbrella
on
the
pocket
of
the
coat
was
pinned
a
paper
on
which
was
written
to
be
worn
every
day
will
be
replaced
by
others
when
miss
minchin
was
quite
agitated
this
was
an
incident
which
suggested
strange
things
to
her
sordid
mind
could
it
be
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
after
all
and
that
the
child
so
neglected
and
so
unkindly
treated
by
her
had
some
powerful
friend
in
the
background
it
would
not
be
very
pleasant
if
there
should
be
such
a
friend
and
he
or
she
should
learn
all
the
truth
about
the
thin
shabby
clothes
the
scant
food
the
hard
work
she
felt
queer
indeed
and
uncertain
and
she
gave
a
at
sara
well
she
said
in
a
voice
such
as
she
had
never
used
since
the
day
the
child
lost
her
father
well
some
one
is
very
kind
to
you
as
you
have
the
things
and
are
to
have
new
ones
when
they
are
worn
out
you
may
as
well
go
and
put
them
on
and
look
respectable
and
after
you
are
dressed
you
may
come
downstairs
and
learn
your
lessons
in
the
so
it
happened
that
about
half
an
hour
afterward
sara
struck
the
entire
of
pupils
dumb
with
amazement
by
making
her
appearance
in
a
costume
such
as
she
had
never
worn
since
the
change
of
fortune
whereby
she
ceased
to
be
a
and
a
she
scarcely
seemed
to
be
the
same
sara
she
was
neatly
dressed
in
a
pretty
gown
of
warm
browns
and
reds
and
even
her
stockings
and
slippers
were
nice
and
dainty
perhaps
some
one
has
left
her
a
fortune
one
of
the
girls
whispered
i
always
thought
something
would
happen
to
her
she
is
so
that
night
when
sara
went
to
her
room
she
carried
out
a
plan
she
had
been
devising
for
some
time
she
wrote
a
note
to
her
unknown
friend
it
ran
as
follows
i
hope
you
will
not
think
it
is
not
polite
that
i
should
write
this
note
to
you
when
you
wish
to
keep
yourself
a
secret
but
i
do
not
mean
to
be
impolite
or
to
try
to
find
out
at
all
only
i
want
to
thank
you
for
being
so
kind
to
me
so
beautiful
kind
and
making
everything
like
a
fairy
story
i
am
so
grateful
to
you
and
i
am
so
happy
i
used
to
be
so
lonely
and
cold
and
hungry
and
now
oh
just
think
what
you
have
done
for
me
please
let
me
say
just
these
words
it
seems
as
if
i
ought
to
say
them
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
the
little
girl
in
the
the
next
morning
she
left
this
on
the
little
table
and
it
was
taken
away
with
the
other
things
so
she
felt
sure
the
magician
had
received
it
and
she
was
happier
for
the
thought
a
few
nights
later
a
very
odd
thing
happened
she
found
something
in
the
room
which
she
certainly
would
never
have
expected
when
she
came
in
as
usual
she
saw
something
small
and
dark
in
her
chair
an
odd
tiny
figure
which
turned
toward
her
a
little
wistful
face
why
it
the
monkey
she
cried
it
is
the
indian
gentleman
monkey
where
can
he
have
come
from
it
was
the
monkey
sitting
up
and
looking
so
like
a
mite
of
a
child
that
it
really
was
quite
pathetic
and
very
soon
sara
found
out
how
he
happened
to
be
in
her
room
the
skylight
was
open
and
it
was
easy
to
guess
that
he
had
crept
out
of
his
master
which
was
only
a
few
feet
away
and
perfectly
easy
to
get
in
and
out
of
even
for
a
climber
less
agile
than
a
monkey
he
had
probably
climbed
to
the
garret
on
a
tour
of
investigation
and
getting
out
upon
the
roof
and
being
attracted
by
the
light
in
sara
attic
had
crept
in
at
all
events
this
seemed
quite
reasonable
and
there
he
was
and
when
sara
went
to
him
he
actually
put
out
his
queer
elfish
little
hands
caught
her
dress
and
jumped
into
her
arms
oh
you
queer
poor
ugly
foreign
little
thing
said
sara
caressing
him
i
ca
help
liking
you
you
look
like
a
sort
of
baby
but
i
am
so
glad
you
are
not
because
your
mother
could
not
be
proud
of
you
and
nobody
would
dare
to
say
you
were
like
any
of
your
relations
but
i
do
like
you
you
have
such
a
forlorn
little
look
in
your
face
perhaps
you
are
sorry
you
are
so
ugly
and
it
always
on
your
mind
i
wonder
if
you
have
a
mind
the
monkey
sat
and
looked
at
her
while
she
talked
and
seemed
much
interested
in
her
remarks
if
one
could
judge
by
his
eyes
and
his
forehead
and
the
way
he
moved
his
head
up
and
down
and
held
it
sideways
and
scratched
it
with
his
little
hand
he
examined
sara
quite
seriously
and
anxiously
too
he
felt
the
stuff
of
her
dress
touched
her
hands
climbed
up
and
examined
her
ears
and
then
sat
on
her
shoulder
holding
a
lock
of
her
hair
looking
mournful
but
not
at
all
agitated
upon
the
whole
he
seemed
pleased
with
sara
but
i
must
take
you
back
she
said
to
him
though
i
sorry
to
have
to
do
it
oh
the
company
you
would
be
to
a
person
she
lifted
him
from
her
shoulder
set
him
on
her
knee
and
gave
him
a
bit
of
cake
he
sat
and
nibbled
it
and
then
put
his
head
on
one
side
looked
at
her
wrinkled
his
forehead
and
then
nibbled
again
in
the
most
companionable
manner
but
you
must
go
home
said
sara
at
last
and
she
took
him
in
her
arms
to
carry
him
downstairs
evidently
he
did
not
want
to
leave
the
room
for
as
they
reached
the
door
he
clung
to
her
neck
and
gave
a
little
scream
of
anger
you
must
be
an
ungrateful
monkey
said
sara
you
ought
to
be
fondest
of
your
own
family
i
am
sure
the
lascar
is
good
to
nobody
saw
her
on
her
way
out
and
very
soon
she
was
standing
on
the
indian
gentleman
front
steps
and
the
lascar
had
opened
the
door
for
her
i
found
your
monkey
in
my
room
she
said
in
hindustani
i
think
he
got
in
through
the
the
man
began
a
rapid
outpouring
of
thanks
but
just
as
he
was
in
the
midst
of
them
a
fretful
hollow
voice
was
heard
through
the
open
door
of
the
nearest
room
the
instant
he
heard
it
the
lascar
disappeared
and
left
sara
still
holding
the
monkey
it
was
not
many
moments
however
before
he
came
back
bringing
a
message
his
master
had
told
him
to
bring
missy
into
the
library
the
sahib
was
very
ill
but
he
wished
to
see
missy
sara
thought
this
odd
but
she
remembered
reading
stories
of
indian
gentlemen
who
having
no
constitutions
were
extremely
cross
and
full
of
whims
and
who
must
have
their
own
way
so
she
followed
the
lascar
when
she
entered
the
room
the
indian
gentleman
was
lying
on
an
easy
chair
propped
up
with
pillows
he
looked
frightfully
his
yellow
face
was
thin
and
his
eyes
were
hollow
he
gave
sara
a
rather
curious
look
it
was
as
if
she
wakened
in
him
some
anxious
interest
you
live
next
door
he
said
yes
answered
sara
i
live
at
miss
she
keeps
a
yes
said
sara
and
you
are
one
of
her
pupils
sara
hesitated
a
moment
i
do
know
exactly
what
i
am
she
replied
why
not
asked
the
indian
gentleman
the
monkey
gave
a
tiny
squeak
and
sara
stroked
him
at
first
she
said
i
was
a
pupil
and
a
parlor
boarder
but
now
what
do
you
mean
by
first
asked
the
indian
gentleman
when
i
was
first
taken
there
by
my
well
what
has
happened
since
then
said
the
invalid
staring
at
her
and
knitting
his
brows
with
a
puzzled
expression
my
papa
died
said
sara
he
lost
all
his
money
and
there
was
none
left
for
me
and
there
was
no
one
to
take
care
of
me
or
pay
miss
minchin
so
so
you
were
sent
up
into
the
garret
and
neglected
and
made
into
a
little
drudge
put
in
the
indian
gentleman
that
is
about
it
is
it
the
color
deepened
on
sara
cheeks
there
was
no
one
to
take
care
of
me
and
no
money
she
said
i
belong
to
what
did
your
father
mean
by
losing
his
money
said
the
gentleman
fretfully
the
red
in
sara
cheeks
grew
deeper
and
she
fixed
her
odd
eyes
on
the
yellow
face
he
did
not
lose
it
himself
she
said
he
had
a
friend
he
was
fond
of
and
it
was
his
friend
who
took
his
money
i
do
know
how
i
understand
he
trusted
his
friend
too
she
saw
the
invalid
start
the
strangest
start
as
if
he
had
been
suddenly
frightened
then
he
spoke
nervously
and
excitedly
that
an
old
story
he
said
it
happens
every
day
but
sometimes
those
who
are
blamed
those
who
do
the
wrong
do
intend
it
and
are
not
so
bad
it
may
happen
through
a
mistake
a
miscalculation
they
may
not
be
so
no
said
sara
but
the
suffering
is
just
as
bad
for
the
others
it
killed
my
the
indian
gentleman
pushed
aside
some
of
the
gorgeous
wraps
that
covered
him
come
a
little
nearer
and
let
me
look
at
you
he
said
his
voice
sounded
very
strange
it
had
a
more
nervous
and
excited
tone
than
before
sara
had
an
odd
fancy
that
he
was
half
afraid
to
look
at
her
she
came
and
stood
nearer
the
monkey
clinging
to
her
and
watching
his
master
anxiously
over
his
shoulder
the
indian
gentleman
hollow
restless
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
her
yes
he
said
at
last
yes
i
can
see
it
tell
me
your
father
his
name
was
ralph
crewe
said
sara
captain
crewe
perhaps
a
sudden
thought
flashing
upon
her
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
of
him
he
died
in
the
indian
gentleman
sank
back
upon
his
pillows
he
looked
very
weak
and
seemed
out
of
breath
yes
he
said
i
knew
him
i
was
his
friend
i
meant
no
harm
if
he
had
only
lived
he
would
have
known
it
turned
out
well
after
all
he
was
a
fine
young
fellow
i
was
fond
of
him
i
will
make
it
right
call
call
the
sara
thought
he
was
going
to
die
but
there
was
no
need
to
call
the
lascar
he
must
have
been
waiting
at
the
door
he
was
in
the
room
and
by
his
master
side
in
an
instant
he
seemed
to
know
what
to
do
he
lifted
the
drooping
head
and
gave
the
invalid
something
in
a
small
glass
the
indian
gentleman
lay
panting
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
he
spoke
in
an
exhausted
but
eager
voice
addressing
the
lascar
in
hindustani
go
for
carmichael
he
said
tell
him
to
come
here
at
once
tell
him
i
have
found
the
child
when
carmichael
arrived
which
occurred
in
a
very
few
minutes
for
it
turned
out
that
he
was
no
other
than
the
father
of
the
large
family
across
the
street
sara
went
home
and
was
allowed
to
take
the
monkey
with
her
she
certainly
did
not
sleep
very
much
that
night
though
the
monkey
behaved
beautifully
and
did
not
disturb
her
in
the
least
it
was
not
the
monkey
that
kept
her
awake
it
was
her
thoughts
and
her
wonders
as
to
what
the
indian
gentleman
had
meant
when
he
said
tell
him
i
have
found
the
what
child
sara
kept
asking
herself
i
was
the
only
child
there
but
how
had
he
found
me
and
why
did
he
want
to
find
me
and
what
is
he
going
to
do
now
i
am
found
is
it
something
about
my
papa
do
i
belong
to
somebody
is
he
one
of
my
relations
is
something
going
to
happen
but
she
found
out
the
very
next
day
in
the
morning
and
it
seemed
that
she
had
been
living
in
a
story
even
more
than
she
had
imagined
first
carmichael
came
and
had
an
interview
with
miss
minchin
and
it
appeared
that
carmichael
besides
occupying
the
important
situation
of
father
to
the
large
family
was
a
lawyer
and
had
charge
of
the
affairs
of
carrisford
which
was
the
real
name
of
the
indian
gentleman
and
as
carrisford
lawyer
carmichael
had
come
to
explain
something
curious
to
miss
minchin
regarding
sara
but
being
the
father
of
the
large
family
he
had
a
very
kind
and
fatherly
feeling
for
children
and
so
after
seeing
miss
minchin
alone
what
did
he
do
but
go
and
bring
across
the
square
his
rosy
motherly
wife
so
that
she
herself
might
talk
to
the
little
lonely
girl
and
tell
her
everything
in
the
best
and
most
motherly
way
and
then
sara
learned
that
she
was
to
be
a
poor
little
drudge
and
outcast
no
more
and
that
a
great
change
had
come
in
her
fortunes
for
all
the
lost
fortune
had
come
back
to
her
and
a
great
deal
had
even
been
added
to
it
it
was
carrisford
who
had
been
her
friend
and
who
had
made
the
investments
which
had
caused
him
the
apparent
loss
of
his
money
but
it
had
so
happened
that
after
poor
young
captain
crewe
death
one
of
the
investments
which
had
seemed
at
the
time
the
very
worst
had
taken
a
sudden
turn
and
proved
to
be
such
a
success
that
it
had
been
a
mine
of
wealth
and
had
more
than
doubled
the
captain
lost
fortune
as
well
as
making
a
fortune
for
carrisford
himself
but
carrisford
had
been
very
unhappy
he
had
truly
loved
his
poor
handsome
generous
young
friend
and
the
knowledge
that
he
had
caused
his
death
had
weighed
upon
him
always
and
broken
both
his
health
and
spirit
the
worst
of
it
had
been
that
when
first
he
thought
himself
and
captain
crewe
ruined
he
had
lost
courage
and
gone
away
because
he
was
not
brave
enough
to
face
the
consequences
of
what
he
had
done
and
so
he
had
not
even
known
where
the
young
soldier
little
girl
had
been
placed
when
he
wanted
to
find
her
and
make
restitution
he
could
discover
no
trace
of
her
and
the
certainty
that
she
was
poor
and
friendless
somewhere
had
made
him
more
miserable
than
ever
when
he
had
taken
the
house
next
to
miss
minchin
he
had
been
so
ill
and
wretched
that
he
had
for
the
time
given
up
the
search
his
troubles
and
the
indian
climate
had
brought
him
almost
to
death
door
indeed
he
had
not
expected
to
live
more
than
a
few
months
and
then
one
day
the
lascar
had
told
him
about
sara
speaking
hindustani
and
gradually
he
had
begun
to
take
a
sort
of
interest
in
the
forlorn
child
though
he
had
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
once
or
twice
and
he
had
not
connected
her
with
the
child
of
his
friend
perhaps
because
he
was
too
languid
to
think
much
about
anything
but
the
lascar
had
found
out
something
of
sara
unhappy
little
life
and
about
the
garret
one
evening
he
had
actually
crept
out
of
his
own
and
looked
into
hers
which
was
a
very
easy
matter
because
as
i
have
said
it
was
only
a
few
feet
away
and
he
had
told
his
master
what
he
had
seen
and
in
a
moment
of
compassion
the
indian
gentleman
had
told
him
to
take
into
the
wretched
little
room
such
comforts
as
he
could
carry
from
the
one
window
to
the
other
and
the
lascar
who
had
developed
an
interest
in
and
an
odd
fondness
for
the
child
who
had
spoken
to
him
in
his
own
tongue
had
been
pleased
with
the
work
and
having
the
silent
swiftness
and
agile
movements
of
many
of
his
race
he
had
made
his
evening
journeys
across
the
few
feet
of
roof
from
to
without
any
trouble
at
all
he
had
watched
sara
movements
until
he
knew
exactly
when
she
was
absent
from
her
room
and
when
she
returned
to
it
and
so
he
had
been
able
to
calculate
the
best
times
for
his
work
generally
he
had
made
them
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
but
once
or
twice
when
he
had
seen
her
go
out
on
errands
he
had
dared
to
go
over
in
the
daytime
being
quite
sure
that
the
garret
was
never
entered
by
any
one
but
herself
his
pleasure
in
the
work
and
his
reports
of
the
results
had
added
to
the
invalid
interest
in
it
and
sometimes
the
master
had
found
the
planning
gave
him
something
to
think
of
which
made
him
almost
forget
his
weariness
and
pain
and
at
last
when
sara
brought
home
the
truant
monkey
he
had
felt
a
wish
to
see
her
and
then
her
likeness
to
her
father
had
done
the
rest
and
now
my
dear
said
good
carmichael
patting
sara
hand
all
your
troubles
are
over
i
am
sure
and
you
are
to
come
home
with
me
and
be
taken
care
of
as
if
you
were
one
of
my
own
little
girls
and
we
are
so
pleased
to
think
of
having
you
with
us
until
everything
is
settled
and
carrisford
is
better
the
excitement
of
last
night
has
made
him
very
weak
but
we
really
think
he
will
get
well
now
that
such
a
load
is
taken
from
his
mind
and
when
he
is
stronger
i
am
sure
he
will
be
as
kind
to
you
as
your
own
papa
would
have
been
he
has
a
very
good
heart
and
he
is
fond
of
children
and
he
has
no
family
at
all
but
we
must
make
you
happy
and
rosy
and
you
must
learn
to
play
and
run
about
as
my
little
girls
do
as
your
little
girls
do
said
sara
i
wonder
if
i
could
i
used
to
watch
them
and
wonder
what
it
was
like
shall
i
feel
as
if
i
belonged
to
somebody
ah
my
love
yes
yes
said
carmichael
dear
me
yes
and
her
motherly
blue
eyes
grew
quite
moist
and
she
suddenly
took
sara
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
that
very
night
before
she
went
to
sleep
sara
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
entire
large
family
and
such
excitement
as
she
and
the
monkey
had
caused
in
that
joyous
circle
could
hardly
be
described
there
was
not
a
child
in
the
nursery
from
the
eton
boy
who
was
the
eldest
to
the
baby
who
was
the
youngest
who
had
not
laid
some
offering
on
her
shrine
all
the
older
ones
knew
something
of
her
wonderful
story
she
had
been
born
in
india
she
had
been
poor
and
lonely
and
unhappy
and
had
lived
in
a
garret
and
been
treated
unkindly
and
now
she
was
to
be
rich
and
happy
and
be
taken
care
of
they
were
so
sorry
for
her
and
so
delighted
and
curious
about
her
all
at
once
the
girls
wished
to
be
with
her
constantly
and
the
little
boys
wished
to
be
told
about
india
the
second
baby
with
the
short
round
legs
simply
sat
and
stared
at
her
and
the
monkey
possibly
wondering
why
she
had
not
brought
a
with
her
i
shall
certainly
wake
up
presently
sara
kept
saying
to
herself
this
one
must
be
a
dream
the
other
one
turned
out
to
be
real
but
this
could
be
but
oh
how
happy
it
is
and
even
when
she
went
to
bed
in
the
bright
pretty
room
not
far
from
carmichael
own
and
carmichael
came
and
kissed
her
and
patted
her
and
tucked
her
in
cozily
she
was
not
sure
that
she
would
not
wake
up
in
the
garret
in
the
morning
and
oh
charles
dear
carmichael
said
to
her
husband
when
she
went
downstairs
to
him
we
must
get
that
lonely
look
out
of
her
eyes
it
is
a
child
look
at
all
i
could
bear
to
see
it
in
one
of
my
own
children
what
the
poor
little
love
must
have
had
to
bear
in
that
dreadful
woman
house
but
surely
she
will
forget
it
in
but
though
the
lonely
look
passed
away
from
sara
face
she
never
quite
forgot
the
garret
at
miss
minchin
and
indeed
she
always
liked
to
remember
the
wonderful
night
when
the
tired
princess
crept
upstairs
cold
and
wet
and
opening
the
door
found
waiting
for
her
and
there
was
no
one
of
the
many
stories
she
was
always
being
called
upon
to
tell
in
the
nursery
of
the
large
family
which
was
more
popular
than
that
particular
one
and
there
was
no
one
of
whom
the
large
family
were
so
fond
as
of
sara
carrisford
did
not
die
but
recovered
and
sara
went
to
live
with
him
and
no
real
princess
could
have
been
better
taken
care
of
than
she
was
it
seemed
that
the
indian
gentleman
could
not
do
enough
to
make
her
happy
and
to
repay
her
for
the
past
and
the
lascar
was
her
devoted
slave
as
her
odd
little
face
grew
brighter
it
grew
so
pretty
and
interesting
that
carrisford
used
to
sit
and
watch
it
many
an
evening
as
they
sat
by
the
fire
together
they
became
great
friends
and
they
used
to
spend
hours
reading
and
talking
together
and
in
a
very
short
time
there
was
no
pleasanter
sight
to
the
indian
gentleman
than
sara
sitting
in
her
big
chair
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
with
a
book
on
her
knee
and
her
soft
dark
hair
tumbling
over
her
warm
cheeks
she
had
a
pretty
habit
of
looking
up
at
him
suddenly
with
a
bright
smile
and
then
he
would
often
say
to
her
are
you
happy
sara
and
then
she
would
answer
i
feel
like
a
real
princess
uncle
he
had
told
her
to
call
him
uncle
tom
there
does
seem
to
be
anything
left
to
she
added
there
was
a
little
joke
between
them
that
he
was
a
magician
and
so
could
do
anything
he
liked
and
it
was
one
of
his
pleasures
to
invent
plans
to
surprise
her
with
enjoyments
she
had
not
thought
of
scarcely
a
day
passed
in
which
he
did
not
do
something
new
for
her
sometimes
she
found
new
flowers
in
her
room
sometimes
a
fanciful
little
gift
tucked
into
some
odd
corner
sometimes
a
new
book
on
her
pillow
once
as
they
sat
together
in
the
evening
they
heard
the
scratch
of
a
heavy
paw
on
the
door
of
the
room
and
when
sara
went
to
find
out
what
it
was
there
stood
a
great
dog
a
splendid
russian
with
a
grand
silver
and
gold
collar
stooping
to
read
the
inscription
upon
the
collar
sara
was
delighted
to
read
the
words
i
am
boris
i
serve
the
princess
then
there
was
a
sort
of
fairy
nursery
arranged
for
the
entertainment
of
the
juvenile
members
of
the
large
family
who
were
always
coming
to
see
sara
and
the
lascar
and
the
monkey
sara
was
as
fond
of
the
large
family
as
they
were
of
her
she
soon
felt
as
if
she
were
a
member
of
it
and
the
companionship
of
the
healthy
happy
children
was
very
good
for
her
all
the
children
rather
looked
up
to
her
and
regarded
her
as
the
cleverest
and
most
brilliant
of
creatures
particularly
after
it
was
discovered
that
she
not
only
knew
stories
of
every
kind
and
could
invent
new
ones
at
a
moment
notice
but
that
she
could
help
with
lessons
and
speak
french
and
german
and
discourse
with
the
lascar
in
hindustani
it
was
rather
a
painful
experience
for
miss
minchin
to
watch
her
fortunes
as
she
had
the
daily
opportunity
to
do
and
to
feel
that
she
had
made
a
serious
mistake
from
a
business
point
of
view
she
had
even
tried
to
retrieve
it
by
suggesting
that
sara
education
should
be
continued
under
her
care
and
had
gone
to
the
length
of
making
an
appeal
to
the
child
herself
i
have
always
been
very
fond
of
you
she
said
then
sara
fixed
her
eyes
upon
her
and
gave
her
one
of
her
odd
looks
have
you
she
answered
yes
said
miss
minchin
amelia
and
i
have
always
said
you
were
the
cleverest
child
we
had
with
us
and
i
am
sure
we
could
make
you
happy
as
a
parlor
sara
thought
of
the
garret
and
the
day
her
ears
were
boxed
and
of
that
other
day
that
dreadful
desolate
day
when
she
had
been
told
that
she
belonged
to
nobody
that
she
had
no
home
and
no
friends
and
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
miss
minchin
face
you
know
why
i
would
not
stay
with
you
she
said
and
it
seems
probable
that
miss
minchin
did
for
after
that
simple
answer
she
had
not
the
boldness
to
pursue
the
subject
she
merely
sent
in
a
bill
for
the
expense
of
sara
education
and
support
and
she
made
it
quite
large
enough
and
because
carrisford
thought
sara
would
wish
it
paid
it
was
paid
when
carmichael
paid
it
he
had
a
brief
interview
with
miss
minchin
in
which
he
expressed
his
opinion
with
much
clearness
and
force
and
it
is
quite
certain
that
miss
minchin
did
not
enjoy
the
conversation
sara
had
been
about
a
month
with
carrisford
and
had
begun
to
realize
that
her
happiness
was
not
a
dream
when
one
night
the
indian
gentleman
saw
that
she
sat
a
long
time
with
her
cheek
on
her
hand
looking
at
the
fire
what
are
you
sara
he
asked
sara
looked
up
with
a
bright
color
on
her
cheeks
i
was
she
said
i
was
remembering
that
hungry
day
and
a
child
i
but
there
were
a
great
many
hungry
days
said
the
indian
gentleman
with
a
rather
sad
tone
in
his
voice
which
hungry
day
was
it
i
forgot
you
did
know
said
sara
it
was
the
day
i
found
the
things
in
my
and
then
she
told
him
the
story
of
the
and
the
fourpence
and
the
child
who
was
hungrier
than
herself
and
somehow
as
she
told
it
though
she
told
it
very
simply
indeed
the
indian
gentleman
found
it
necessary
to
shade
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
look
down
at
the
floor
and
i
was
a
kind
of
plan
said
sara
when
she
had
finished
i
was
thinking
i
would
like
to
do
what
is
it
said
her
guardian
in
a
low
tone
you
may
do
anything
you
like
to
do
i
was
wondering
said
sara
you
know
you
say
i
have
a
great
deal
of
money
and
i
was
wondering
if
i
could
go
and
see
the
and
tell
her
that
if
when
hungry
children
particularly
on
those
dreadful
days
come
and
sit
on
the
steps
or
look
in
at
the
window
she
would
just
call
them
in
and
give
them
something
to
eat
she
might
send
the
bills
to
me
and
i
would
pay
them
could
i
do
that
you
shall
do
it
morning
said
the
indian
gentleman
thank
you
said
sara
you
see
i
know
what
it
is
to
be
hungry
and
it
is
very
hard
when
one
ca
even
pretend
it
yes
yes
my
dear
said
the
indian
gentleman
yes
it
must
be
try
to
forget
it
come
and
sit
on
this
footstool
near
my
knee
and
only
remember
you
are
a
yes
said
sara
and
i
can
give
buns
and
bread
to
the
and
she
went
and
sat
on
the
stool
and
the
indian
gentleman
he
used
to
like
her
to
call
him
that
too
sometimes
in
fact
very
often
drew
her
small
dark
head
down
upon
his
knee
and
stroked
her
hair
the
next
morning
a
carriage
drew
up
before
the
door
of
the
baker
shop
and
a
gentleman
and
a
little
girl
got
out
oddly
enough
just
as
the
was
putting
a
tray
of
smoking
hotbuns
into
the
window
when
sara
entered
the
shop
the
woman
turned
and
looked
at
her
and
leaving
the
buns
came
and
stood
behind
the
counter
for
a
moment
she
looked
at
sara
very
hard
indeed
and
then
her
face
lighted
up
i
that
sure
i
remember
you
miss
she
said
and
yet
yes
said
sara
once
you
gave
me
six
buns
for
fourpence
and
and
you
gave
five
of
to
a
said
the
woman
always
remembered
it
i
could
make
it
out
at
first
i
beg
pardon
sir
but
there
not
many
young
people
that
notices
a
hungry
face
in
that
way
and
i
thought
of
it
many
a
time
excuse
the
liberty
miss
but
you
look
rosier
and
better
than
you
did
that
i
am
better
thank
you
said
sara
and
and
i
am
happier
and
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
do
something
for
me
miss
exclaimed
the
woman
why
bless
you
yes
miss
what
can
i
do
and
then
sara
made
her
little
proposal
and
the
woman
listened
to
it
with
an
astonished
face
why
bless
me
she
said
when
she
had
heard
it
all
yes
miss
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
do
it
i
am
a
working
woman
myself
and
afford
to
do
much
on
my
own
account
and
there
sights
of
trouble
on
every
side
but
if
you
excuse
me
i
bound
to
say
i
given
many
a
bit
of
bread
away
since
that
wet
afternoon
just
along
o
thinkin
of
you
an
how
wet
an
cold
you
was
an
how
you
looked
an
yet
you
give
away
your
hot
buns
as
if
you
was
a
the
indian
gentleman
smiled
involuntarily
and
sara
smiled
a
little
too
she
looked
so
hungry
she
said
she
was
hungrier
than
i
she
was
starving
said
the
woman
many
the
time
she
told
me
of
it
since
how
she
sat
there
in
the
wet
and
felt
as
if
a
wolf
was
at
her
poor
young
oh
have
you
seen
her
since
then
exclaimed
sara
do
you
know
where
she
is
i
know
said
the
woman
why
she
in
that
there
back
room
now
miss
an
has
been
for
a
month
an
a
decent
girl
she
going
to
turn
out
an
such
a
help
to
me
in
the
day
shop
an
in
the
kitchen
as
you
scarce
believe
knowing
how
she
she
stepped
to
the
door
of
the
little
back
parlor
and
spoke
and
the
next
minute
a
girl
came
out
and
followed
her
behind
the
counter
and
actually
it
was
the
clean
and
neatly
clothed
and
looking
as
if
she
had
not
been
hungry
for
a
long
time
she
looked
shy
but
she
had
a
nice
face
now
that
she
was
no
longer
a
savage
and
the
wild
look
had
gone
from
her
eyes
and
she
knew
sara
in
an
instant
and
stood
and
looked
at
her
as
if
she
could
never
look
enough
you
see
said
the
woman
i
told
her
to
come
here
when
she
was
hungry
and
when
she
come
i
give
her
odd
jobs
to
do
an
i
found
she
was
willing
an
somehow
i
got
to
like
her
an
the
end
of
it
was
i
given
her
a
place
an
a
home
an
she
helps
me
an
behaves
as
well
an
is
as
thankful
as
a
girl
can
be
her
name
anne
she
has
no
the
two
children
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
a
few
moments
in
eyes
a
new
thought
was
growing
i
glad
you
have
such
a
good
home
she
said
perhaps
brown
will
let
you
give
the
buns
and
bread
to
the
children
perhaps
you
would
like
to
do
it
because
you
know
what
it
is
to
be
hungry
yes
miss
said
the
girl
and
somehow
sara
felt
as
if
she
understood
her
though
the
girl
said
nothing
more
and
only
stood
still
and
looked
and
looked
after
her
as
she
went
out
of
the
shop
and
got
into
the
carriage
and
drove
away
