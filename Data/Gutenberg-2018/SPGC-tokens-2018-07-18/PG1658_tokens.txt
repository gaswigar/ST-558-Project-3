phaedo
by
plato
translated
by
benjamin
jowett
introduction
after
an
interval
of
some
months
or
years
and
at
phlius
a
town
of
peloponnesus
the
tale
of
the
last
hours
of
socrates
is
narrated
to
echecrates
and
other
phliasians
by
phaedo
the
disciple
the
dialogue
necessarily
takes
the
form
of
a
narrative
because
socrates
has
to
be
described
acting
as
well
as
speaking
the
minutest
particulars
of
the
event
are
interesting
to
distant
friends
and
the
narrator
has
an
equal
interest
in
them
during
the
voyage
of
the
sacred
ship
to
and
from
delos
which
has
occupied
thirty
days
the
execution
of
socrates
has
been
deferred
compare
xen
mem
the
time
has
been
passed
by
him
in
conversation
with
a
select
company
of
disciples
but
now
the
holy
season
is
over
and
the
disciples
meet
earlier
than
usual
in
order
that
they
may
converse
with
socrates
for
the
last
time
those
who
were
present
and
those
who
might
have
been
expected
to
be
present
are
mentioned
by
name
there
are
simmias
and
cebes
crito
two
disciples
of
philolaus
whom
socrates
his
enchantments
has
attracted
from
thebes
mem
crito
the
aged
friend
the
attendant
of
the
prison
who
is
as
good
as
a
friend
these
take
part
in
the
conversation
there
are
present
also
hermogenes
from
whom
xenophon
derived
his
information
about
the
trial
of
socrates
mem
the
apollodorus
symp
euclid
and
terpsion
from
megara
compare
theaet
ctesippus
antisthenes
menexenus
and
some
other
members
of
the
socratic
circle
all
of
whom
are
silent
auditors
aristippus
cleombrotus
and
plato
are
noted
as
absent
almost
as
soon
as
the
friends
of
socrates
enter
the
prison
xanthippe
and
her
children
are
sent
home
in
the
care
of
one
of
crito
servants
socrates
himself
has
just
been
released
from
chains
and
is
led
by
this
circumstance
to
make
the
natural
remark
that
follows
pain
observe
that
plato
is
preparing
the
way
for
his
doctrine
of
the
alternation
of
opposites
would
have
represented
them
in
a
fable
as
a
creature
of
the
gods
the
mention
of
aesop
reminds
cebes
of
a
question
which
had
been
asked
by
evenus
the
poet
compare
apol
socrates
who
was
not
a
poet
while
in
prison
had
been
putting
aesop
into
verse
several
times
in
his
life
he
had
been
warned
in
dreams
that
he
should
practise
music
and
as
he
was
about
to
die
and
was
not
certain
of
what
was
meant
he
wished
to
fulfil
the
admonition
in
the
letter
as
well
as
in
the
spirit
by
writing
verses
as
well
as
by
cultivating
philosophy
tell
this
to
evenus
and
say
that
i
would
have
him
follow
me
in
death
is
not
at
all
the
sort
of
man
to
comply
with
your
request
socrates
is
he
not
a
philosopher
he
will
be
willing
to
die
although
he
will
not
take
his
own
life
for
that
is
held
to
be
unlawful
cebes
asks
why
suicide
is
thought
not
to
be
right
if
death
is
to
be
accounted
a
good
well
according
to
one
explanation
because
man
is
a
prisoner
who
must
not
open
the
door
of
his
prison
and
run
away
this
is
the
truth
in
a
or
rather
because
he
is
not
his
own
property
but
a
possession
of
the
gods
and
has
no
right
to
make
away
with
that
which
does
not
belong
to
him
but
why
asks
cebes
if
he
is
a
possession
of
the
gods
should
he
wish
to
die
and
leave
them
for
he
is
under
their
protection
and
surely
he
can
not
take
better
care
of
himself
than
they
take
of
him
simmias
explains
that
cebes
is
really
referring
to
socrates
whom
they
think
too
unmoved
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
the
gods
and
his
friends
socrates
answers
that
he
is
going
to
other
gods
who
are
wise
and
good
and
perhaps
to
better
friends
and
he
professes
that
he
is
ready
to
defend
himself
against
the
charge
of
cebes
the
company
shall
be
his
judges
and
he
hopes
that
he
will
be
more
successful
in
convincing
them
than
he
had
been
in
convincing
the
court
the
philosopher
desires
death
which
the
wicked
world
will
insinuate
that
he
also
deserves
and
perhaps
he
does
but
not
in
any
sense
which
they
are
capable
of
understanding
enough
of
them
the
real
question
is
what
is
the
nature
of
that
death
which
he
desires
death
is
the
separation
of
soul
and
body
and
the
philosopher
desires
such
a
separation
he
would
like
to
be
freed
from
the
dominion
of
bodily
pleasures
and
of
the
senses
which
are
always
perturbing
his
mental
vision
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
eyes
and
ears
and
with
the
light
of
the
mind
only
to
behold
the
light
of
truth
all
the
evils
and
impurities
and
necessities
of
men
come
from
the
body
and
death
separates
him
from
these
corruptions
which
in
life
he
can
not
wholly
lay
aside
why
then
should
he
repine
when
the
hour
of
separation
arrives
why
if
he
is
dead
while
he
lives
should
he
fear
that
other
death
through
which
alone
he
can
behold
wisdom
in
her
purity
besides
the
philosopher
has
notions
of
good
and
evil
unlike
those
of
other
men
for
they
are
courageous
because
they
are
afraid
of
greater
dangers
and
temperate
because
they
desire
greater
pleasures
but
he
disdains
this
balancing
of
pleasures
and
pains
which
is
the
exchange
of
commerce
and
not
of
virtue
all
the
virtues
including
wisdom
are
regarded
by
him
only
as
purifications
of
the
soul
and
this
was
the
meaning
of
the
founders
of
the
mysteries
when
they
said
are
the
but
few
are
the
mystics
compare
matt
xxii
are
called
but
few
are
chosen
and
in
the
hope
that
he
is
one
of
these
mystics
socrates
is
now
departing
this
is
his
answer
to
any
one
who
charges
him
with
indifference
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
the
gods
and
his
friends
still
a
fear
is
expressed
that
the
soul
upon
leaving
the
body
may
vanish
away
like
smoke
or
air
socrates
in
answer
appeals
first
of
all
to
the
old
orphic
tradition
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
are
in
the
world
below
and
that
the
living
come
from
them
this
he
attempts
to
found
on
a
philosophical
assumption
that
all
opposites
less
greater
weaker
stronger
sleeping
waking
life
death
are
generated
out
of
each
other
nor
can
the
process
of
generation
be
only
a
passage
from
living
to
dying
for
then
all
would
end
in
death
the
perpetual
sleeper
endymion
would
be
no
longer
distinguished
from
the
rest
of
mankind
the
circle
of
nature
is
not
complete
unless
the
living
come
from
the
dead
as
well
as
pass
to
them
the
platonic
doctrine
of
reminiscence
is
then
adduced
as
a
confirmation
of
the
of
the
soul
some
proofs
of
this
doctrine
are
demanded
one
proof
given
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
meno
and
is
derived
from
the
latent
knowledge
of
mathematics
which
may
be
elicited
from
an
unlearned
person
when
a
diagram
is
presented
to
him
again
there
is
a
power
of
association
which
from
seeing
simmias
may
remember
cebes
or
from
seeing
a
picture
of
simmias
may
remember
simmias
the
lyre
may
recall
the
player
of
the
lyre
and
equal
pieces
of
wood
or
stone
may
be
associated
with
the
higher
notion
of
absolute
equality
but
here
observe
that
material
equalities
fall
short
of
the
conception
of
absolute
equality
with
which
they
are
compared
and
which
is
the
measure
of
them
and
the
measure
or
standard
must
be
prior
to
that
which
is
measured
the
idea
of
equality
prior
to
the
visible
equals
and
if
prior
to
them
then
prior
also
to
the
perceptions
of
the
senses
which
recall
them
and
therefore
either
given
before
birth
or
at
birth
but
all
men
have
not
this
knowledge
nor
have
any
without
a
process
of
reminiscence
which
is
a
proof
that
it
is
not
innate
or
given
at
birth
unless
indeed
it
was
given
and
taken
away
at
the
same
instant
but
if
not
given
to
men
in
birth
it
must
have
been
given
before
birth
this
is
the
only
alternative
which
remains
and
if
we
had
ideas
in
a
former
state
then
our
souls
must
have
existed
and
must
have
had
intelligence
in
a
former
state
the
of
the
soul
stands
or
falls
with
the
doctrine
of
ideas
it
is
objected
by
simmias
and
cebes
that
these
arguments
only
prove
a
former
and
not
a
future
existence
socrates
answers
this
objection
by
recalling
the
previous
argument
in
which
he
had
shown
that
the
living
come
from
the
dead
but
the
fear
that
the
soul
at
departing
may
vanish
into
air
especially
if
there
is
a
wind
blowing
at
the
time
has
not
yet
been
charmed
away
he
proceeds
when
we
fear
that
the
soul
will
vanish
away
let
us
ask
ourselves
what
is
that
which
we
suppose
to
be
liable
to
dissolution
is
it
the
simple
or
the
compound
the
unchanging
or
the
changing
the
invisible
idea
or
the
visible
object
of
sense
clearly
the
latter
and
not
the
former
and
therefore
not
the
soul
which
in
her
own
pure
thought
is
unchangeable
and
only
when
using
the
senses
descends
into
the
region
of
change
again
the
soul
commands
the
body
serves
in
this
respect
too
the
soul
is
akin
to
the
divine
and
the
body
to
the
mortal
and
in
every
point
of
view
the
soul
is
the
image
of
divinity
and
immortality
and
the
body
of
the
human
and
mortal
and
whereas
the
body
is
liable
to
speedy
dissolution
the
soul
is
almost
if
not
quite
indissoluble
compare
tim
yet
even
the
body
may
be
preserved
for
ages
by
the
embalmer
art
how
unlikely
then
that
the
soul
will
perish
and
be
dissipated
into
air
while
on
her
way
to
the
good
and
wise
god
she
has
been
gathered
into
herself
holding
aloof
from
the
body
and
practising
death
all
her
life
long
and
she
is
now
finally
released
from
the
errors
and
follies
and
passions
of
men
and
for
ever
dwells
in
the
company
of
the
gods
but
the
soul
which
is
polluted
and
engrossed
by
the
corporeal
and
has
no
eye
except
that
of
the
senses
and
is
weighed
down
by
the
bodily
appetites
can
not
attain
to
this
abstraction
in
her
fear
of
the
world
below
she
lingers
about
the
sepulchre
loath
to
leave
the
body
which
she
loved
a
ghostly
apparition
saturated
with
sense
and
therefore
visible
at
length
entering
into
some
animal
of
a
nature
congenial
to
her
former
life
of
sensuality
or
violence
she
takes
the
form
of
an
ass
a
wolf
or
a
kite
and
of
these
earthly
souls
the
happiest
are
those
who
have
practised
virtue
without
philosophy
they
are
allowed
to
pass
into
gentle
and
social
natures
such
as
bees
and
ants
compare
republic
meno
but
only
the
philosopher
who
departs
pure
is
permitted
to
enter
the
company
of
the
gods
compare
phaedrus
this
is
the
reason
why
he
abstains
from
fleshly
lusts
and
not
because
he
fears
loss
or
disgrace
which
is
the
motive
of
other
men
he
too
has
been
a
captive
and
the
willing
agent
of
his
own
captivity
but
philosophy
has
spoken
to
him
and
he
has
heard
her
voice
she
has
gently
entreated
him
and
brought
him
out
of
the
clay
and
purged
away
the
mists
of
passion
and
the
illusions
of
sense
which
envelope
him
his
soul
has
escaped
from
the
influence
of
pleasures
and
pains
which
are
like
nails
fastening
her
to
the
body
to
that
she
will
not
return
and
therefore
she
abstains
from
bodily
pleasures
not
from
a
desire
of
having
more
or
greater
ones
but
because
she
knows
that
only
when
calm
and
free
from
the
dominion
of
the
body
can
she
behold
the
light
of
truth
simmias
and
cebes
remain
in
doubt
but
they
are
unwilling
to
raise
objections
at
such
a
time
socrates
wonders
at
their
reluctance
let
them
regard
him
rather
as
the
swan
who
having
sung
the
praises
of
apollo
all
his
life
long
sings
at
his
death
more
lustily
than
ever
simmias
acknowledges
that
there
is
cowardice
in
not
probing
truth
to
the
bottom
if
truth
divine
and
inspired
is
not
to
be
had
then
let
a
man
take
the
best
of
human
notions
and
upon
this
frail
bark
let
him
sail
through
life
he
proceeds
to
state
his
difficulty
it
has
been
argued
that
the
soul
is
invisible
and
incorporeal
and
therefore
immortal
and
prior
to
the
body
but
is
not
the
soul
acknowledged
to
be
a
harmony
and
has
she
not
the
same
relation
to
the
body
as
the
harmony
which
like
her
is
invisible
has
to
the
lyre
and
yet
the
harmony
does
not
survive
the
lyre
cebes
has
also
an
objection
which
like
simmias
he
expresses
in
a
figure
he
is
willing
to
admit
that
the
soul
is
more
lasting
than
the
body
but
the
more
lasting
nature
of
the
soul
does
not
prove
her
immortality
for
after
having
worn
out
many
bodies
in
a
single
life
and
many
more
in
successive
births
and
deaths
she
may
at
last
perish
or
as
socrates
afterwards
restates
the
objection
the
very
act
of
birth
may
be
the
beginning
of
her
death
and
her
last
body
may
survive
her
just
as
the
coat
of
an
old
weaver
is
left
behind
him
after
he
is
dead
although
a
man
is
more
lasting
than
his
coat
and
he
who
would
prove
the
immortality
of
the
soul
must
prove
not
only
that
the
soul
outlives
one
or
many
bodies
but
that
she
outlives
them
all
the
audience
like
the
chorus
in
a
play
for
a
moment
interpret
the
feelings
of
the
actors
there
is
a
temporary
depression
and
then
the
enquiry
is
resumed
it
is
a
melancholy
reflection
that
arguments
like
men
are
apt
to
be
deceivers
and
those
who
have
been
often
deceived
become
distrustful
both
of
arguments
and
of
friends
but
this
unfortunate
experience
should
not
make
us
either
haters
of
men
or
haters
of
arguments
the
want
of
health
and
truth
is
not
in
the
argument
but
in
ourselves
socrates
who
is
about
to
die
is
sensible
of
his
own
weakness
he
desires
to
be
impartial
but
he
can
not
help
feeling
that
he
has
too
great
an
interest
in
the
truth
of
the
argument
and
therefore
he
would
have
his
friends
examine
and
refute
him
if
they
think
that
he
is
in
error
at
his
request
simmias
and
cebes
repeat
their
objections
they
do
not
go
to
the
length
of
denying
the
of
ideas
simmias
is
of
opinion
that
the
soul
is
a
harmony
of
the
body
but
the
admission
of
the
of
ideas
and
therefore
of
the
soul
is
at
variance
with
this
compare
a
parallel
difficulty
in
theaet
for
a
harmony
is
an
effect
whereas
the
soul
is
not
an
effect
but
a
cause
a
harmony
follows
but
the
soul
leads
a
harmony
admits
of
degrees
and
the
soul
has
no
degrees
again
upon
the
supposition
that
the
soul
is
a
harmony
why
is
one
soul
better
than
another
are
they
more
or
less
harmonized
or
is
there
one
harmony
within
another
but
the
soul
does
not
admit
of
degrees
and
can
not
therefore
be
more
or
less
harmonized
further
the
soul
is
often
engaged
in
resisting
the
affections
of
the
body
as
homer
describes
odysseus
his
heart
could
he
have
written
this
under
the
idea
that
the
soul
is
a
harmony
of
the
body
nay
rather
are
we
not
contradicting
homer
and
ourselves
in
affirming
anything
of
the
sort
the
goddess
harmonia
as
socrates
playfully
terms
the
argument
of
simmias
has
been
happily
disposed
of
and
now
an
answer
has
to
be
given
to
the
theban
cadmus
socrates
recapitulates
the
argument
of
cebes
which
as
he
remarks
involves
the
whole
question
of
natural
growth
or
causation
about
this
he
proposes
to
narrate
his
own
mental
experience
when
he
was
young
he
had
puzzled
himself
with
physics
he
had
enquired
into
the
growth
and
decay
of
animals
and
the
origin
of
thought
until
at
last
he
began
to
doubt
the
fact
that
growth
is
the
result
of
eating
and
drinking
and
so
he
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
he
was
not
meant
for
such
enquiries
nor
was
he
less
perplexed
with
notions
of
comparison
and
number
at
first
he
had
imagined
himself
to
understand
differences
of
greater
and
less
and
to
know
that
ten
is
two
more
than
eight
and
the
like
but
now
those
very
notions
appeared
to
him
to
contain
a
contradiction
for
how
can
one
be
divided
into
two
or
two
be
compounded
into
one
these
are
difficulties
which
socrates
can
not
answer
of
generation
and
destruction
he
knows
nothing
but
he
has
a
confused
notion
of
another
method
in
which
matters
of
this
sort
are
to
be
investigated
compare
republic

then
he
heard
some
one
reading
out
of
a
book
of
anaxagoras
that
mind
is
the
cause
of
all
things
and
he
said
to
himself
if
mind
is
the
cause
of
all
things
surely
mind
must
dispose
them
all
for
the
best
the
new
teacher
will
show
me
this
of
the
best
in
man
and
nature
how
great
had
been
his
hopes
and
how
great
his
disappointment
for
he
found
that
his
new
friend
was
anything
but
consistent
in
his
use
of
mind
as
a
cause
and
that
he
soon
introduced
winds
waters
and
other
eccentric
notions
compare
arist
metaph
it
was
as
if
a
person
had
said
that
socrates
is
sitting
here
because
he
is
made
up
of
bones
and
muscles
instead
of
telling
the
true
reason
that
he
is
here
because
the
athenians
have
thought
good
to
sentence
him
to
death
and
he
has
thought
good
to
await
his
sentence
had
his
bones
and
muscles
been
left
by
him
to
their
own
ideas
of
right
they
would
long
ago
have
taken
themselves
off
but
surely
there
is
a
great
confusion
of
the
cause
and
condition
in
all
this
and
this
confusion
also
leads
people
into
all
sorts
of
erroneous
theories
about
the
position
and
motions
of
the
earth
none
of
them
know
how
much
stronger
than
any
atlas
is
the
power
of
the
best
but
this
is
still
undiscovered
and
in
enquiring
after
the
cause
we
can
only
hope
to
attain
the
second
best
now
there
is
a
danger
in
the
contemplation
of
the
nature
of
things
as
there
is
a
danger
in
looking
at
the
sun
during
an
eclipse

the
precaution
is
taken
of
looking
only
at
the
image
reflected
in

or

compare
laws
republic
was
afraid
says
socrates
i
might
injure
the
eye
of
the
soul
i
thought
that
i
had
better
return
to
the
old
and
safe
method
of
ideas
though
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
who
contemplates
existence
through
the
medium
of
ideas
sees
only
through
a
glass
darkly
any
more
than
he
who
contemplates
actual
effects
if
the
existence
of
ideas
is
granted
to
him
socrates
is
of
opinion
that
he
will
then
have
no
difficulty
in
proving
the
immortality
of
the
soul
he
will
only
ask
for
a
further
admission
that
beauty
is
the
cause
of
the
beautiful
greatness
the
cause
of
the
great
smallness
of
the
small
and
so
on
of
other
things
this
is
a
safe
and
simple
answer
which
escapes
the
contradictions
of
greater
and
less
greater
by
reason
of
that
which
is
smaller
of
addition
and
subtraction
and
the
other
difficulties
of
relation
these
subtleties
he
is
for
leaving
to
wiser
heads
than
his
own
he
prefers
to
test
ideas
by
the
consistency
of
their
consequences
and
if
asked
to
give
an
account
of
them
goes
back
to
some
higher
idea
or
hypothesis
which
appears
to
him
to
be
the
best
until
at
last
he
arrives
at
a
republic
phil
the
doctrine
of
ideas
which
has
long
ago
received
the
assent
of
the
socratic
circle
is
now
affirmed
by
the
phliasian
auditor
to
command
the
assent
of
any
man
of
sense
the
narrative
is
continued
socrates
is
desirous
of
explaining
how
opposite
ideas
may
appear
to
but
do
not
really
in
the
same
thing
or
person
for
example
simmias
may
be
said
to
have
greatness
and
also
smallness
because
he
is
greater
than
socrates
and
less
than
phaedo
and
yet
simmias
is
not
really
great
and
also
small
but
only
when
compared
to
phaedo
and
socrates
i
use
the
illustration
says
socrates
because
i
want
to
show
you
not
only
that
ideal
opposites
exclude
one
another
but
also
the
opposites
in
us
i
for
example
having
the
attribute
of
smallness
remain
small
and
can
not
become
great
the
smallness
which
is
in
me
drives
out
greatness
one
of
the
company
here
remarked
that
this
was
inconsistent
with
the
old
assertion
that
opposites
generated
opposites
but
that
replies
socrates
was
affirmed
not
of
opposite
ideas
either
in
us
or
in
nature
but
of
opposition
in
the
concrete
not
of
life
and
death
but
of
individuals
living
and
dying
when
this
objection
has
been
removed
socrates
proceeds
this
doctrine
of
the
mutual
exclusion
of
opposites
is
not
only
true
of
the
opposites
themselves
but
of
things
which
are
inseparable
from
them
for
example
cold
and
heat
are
opposed
and
fire
which
is
inseparable
from
heat
can
not
with
cold
or
snow
which
is
inseparable
from
cold
with
heat
again
the
number
three
excludes
the
number
four
because
three
is
an
odd
number
and
four
is
an
even
number
and
the
odd
is
opposed
to
the
even
thus
we
are
able
to
proceed
a
step
beyond
safe
and
simple
answer
we
may
say
not
only
that
the
odd
excludes
the
even
but
that
the
number
three
which
participates
in
oddness
excludes
the
even
and
in
like
manner
not
only
does
life
exclude
death
but
the
soul
of
which
life
is
the
inseparable
attribute
also
excludes
death
and
that
of
which
life
is
the
inseparable
attribute
is
by
the
force
of
the
terms
imperishable
if
the
odd
principle
were
imperishable
then
the
number
three
would
not
perish
but
remove
on
the
approach
of
the
even
principle
but
the
immortal
is
imperishable
and
therefore
the
soul
on
the
approach
of
death
does
not
perish
but
removes
thus
all
objections
appear
to
be
finally
silenced
and
now
the
application
has
to
be
made
if
the
soul
is
immortal
manner
of
persons
ought
we
to
be
having
regard
not
only
to
time
but
to
eternity
for
death
is
not
the
end
of
all
and
the
wicked
is
not
released
from
his
evil
by
death
but
every
one
carries
with
him
into
the
world
below
that
which
he
is
or
has
become
and
that
only
for
after
death
the
soul
is
carried
away
to
judgment
and
when
she
has
received
her
punishment
returns
to
earth
in
the
course
of
ages
the
wise
soul
is
conscious
of
her
situation
and
follows
the
attendant
angel
who
guides
her
through
the
windings
of
the
world
below
but
the
impure
soul
wanders
hither
and
thither
without
companion
or
guide
and
is
carried
at
last
to
her
own
place
as
the
pure
soul
is
also
carried
away
to
hers
order
that
you
may
understand
this
i
must
first
describe
to
you
the
nature
and
conformation
of
the
earth
now
the
whole
earth
is
a
globe
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
heavens
and
is
maintained
there
by
the
perfection
of
balance
that
which
we
call
the
earth
is
only
one
of
many
small
hollows
wherein
collect
the
mists
and
waters
and
the
thick
lower
air
but
the
true
earth
is
above
and
is
in
a
finer
and
subtler
element
and
if
like
birds
we
could
fly
to
the
surface
of
the
air
in
the
same
manner
that
fishes
come
to
the
top
of
the
sea
then
we
should
behold
the
true
earth
and
the
true
heaven
and
the
true
stars
our
earth
is
everywhere
corrupted
and
corroded
and
even
the
land
which
is
fairer
than
the
sea
for
that
is
a
mere
chaos
or
waste
of
water
and
mud
and
sand
has
nothing
to
show
in
comparison
of
the
other
world
but
the
heavenly
earth
is
of
divers
colours
sparkling
with
jewels
brighter
than
gold
and
whiter
than
any
snow
having
flowers
and
fruits
innumerable
and
the
inhabitants
dwell
some
on
the
shore
of
the
sea
of
air
others
in
of
the
blest
and
they
hold
converse
with
the
gods
and
behold
the
sun
moon
and
stars
as
they
truly
are
and
their
other
blessedness
is
of
a
piece
with
this
the
hollows
on
the
surface
of
the
globe
vary
in
size
and
shape
from
that
which
we
inhabit
but
all
are
connected
by
passages
and
perforations
in
the
interior
of
the
earth
and
there
is
one
huge
chasm
or
opening
called
tartarus
into
which
streams
of
fire
and
water
and
liquid
mud
are
ever
flowing
of
these
small
portions
find
their
way
to
the
surface
and
form
seas
and
rivers
and
volcanoes
there
is
a
perpetual
inhalation
and
exhalation
of
the
air
rising
and
falling
as
the
waters
pass
into
the
depths
of
the
earth
and
return
again
in
their
course
forming
lakes
and
rivers
but
never
descending
below
the
centre
of
the
earth
for
on
either
side
the
rivers
flowing
either
way
are
stopped
by
a
precipice
these
rivers
are
many
and
mighty
and
there
are
four
principal
ones
oceanus
acheron
pyriphlegethon
and
cocytus
oceanus
is
the
river
which
encircles
the
earth
acheron
takes
an
opposite
direction
and
after
flowing
under
the
earth
through
desert
places
at
last
reaches
the
acherusian
lake
this
is
the
river
at
which
the
souls
of
the
dead
await
their
return
to
earth
pyriphlegethon
is
a
stream
of
fire
which
coils
round
the
earth
and
flows
into
the
depths
of
tartarus
the
fourth
river
cocytus
is
that
which
is
called
by
the
poets
the
stygian
river
and
passes
into
and
forms
the
lake
styx
from
the
waters
of
which
it
gains
new
and
strange
powers
this
river
too
falls
into
tartarus
the
dead
are
first
of
all
judged
according
to
their
deeds
and
those
who
are
incurable
are
thrust
into
tartarus
from
which
they
never
come
out
those
who
have
only
committed
venial
sins
are
first
purified
of
them
and
then
rewarded
for
the
good
which
they
have
done
those
who
have
committed
crimes
great
indeed
but
not
unpardonable
are
thrust
into
tartarus
but
are
cast
forth
at
the
end
of
a
year
by
way
of
pyriphlegethon
or
cocytus
and
these
carry
them
as
far
as
the
acherusian
lake
where
they
call
upon
their
victims
to
let
them
come
out
of
the
rivers
into
the
lake
and
if
they
prevail
then
they
are
let
out
and
their
sufferings
cease
if
not
they
are
borne
unceasingly
into
tartarus
and
back
again
until
they
at
last
obtain
mercy
the
pure
souls
also
receive
their
reward
and
have
their
abode
in
the
upper
earth
and
a
select
few
in
still
fairer
socrates
is
not
prepared
to
insist
on
the
literal
accuracy
of
this
description
but
he
is
confident
that
something
of
the
kind
is
true
he
who
has
sought
after
the
pleasures
of
knowledge
and
rejected
the
pleasures
of
the
body
has
reason
to
be
of
good
hope
at
the
approach
of
death
whose
voice
is
already
speaking
to
him
and
who
will
one
day
be
heard
calling
all
men
the
hour
has
come
at
which
he
must
drink
the
poison
and
not
much
remains
to
be
done
how
shall
they
bury
him
that
is
a
question
which
he
refuses
to
entertain
for
they
are
burying
not
him
but
his
dead
body
his
friends
had
once
been
sureties
that
he
would
remain
and
they
shall
now
be
sureties
that
he
has
run
away
yet
he
would
not
die
without
the
customary
ceremonies
of
washing
and
burial
shall
he
make
a
libation
of
the
poison
in
the
spirit
he
will
but
not
in
the
letter
one
request
he
utters
in
the
very
act
of
death
which
has
been
a
puzzle
to
after
ages
with
a
sort
of
irony
he
remembers
that
a
trifling
religious
duty
is
still
unfulfilled
just
as
above
he
desires
before
he
departs
to
compose
a
few
verses
in
order
to
satisfy
a
scruple
about
a
dream
unless
indeed
we
suppose
him
to
mean
that
he
was
now
restored
to
health
and
made
the
customary
offering
to
asclepius
in
token
of
his
recovery
the
doctrine
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
has
sunk
deep
into
the
heart
of
the
human
race
and
men
are
apt
to
rebel
against
any
examination
of
the
nature
or
grounds
of
their
belief
they
do
not
like
to
acknowledge
that
this
as
well
as
the
other
ideas
of
man
has
a
history
in
time
which
may
be
traced
in
greek
poetry
or
philosophy
and
also
in
the
hebrew
scriptures
they
convert
feeling
into
reasoning
and
throw
a
network
of
dialectics
over
that
which
is
really
a
instinct
in
the
same
temper
which
socrates
reproves
in
himself
they
are
disposed
to
think
that
even
fallacies
will
do
no
harm
for
they
will
die
with
them
and
while
they
live
they
will
gain
by
the
delusion
and
when
they
consider
the
numberless
bad
arguments
which
have
been
pressed
into
the
service
of
theology
they
say
like
the
companions
of
socrates
argument
can
we
ever
trust
again
but
there
is
a
better
and
higher
spirit
to
be
gathered
from
the
phaedo
as
well
as
from
the
other
writings
of
plato
which
says
that
first
principles
should
be
most
constantly
reviewed
phaedo
and
crat
and
that
the
highest
subjects
demand
of
us
the
greatest
accuracy
republic
also
that
we
must
not
become
misologists
because
arguments
are
apt
to
be
deceivers
in
former
ages
there
was
a
customary
rather
than
a
reasoned
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
it
was
based
on
the
authority
of
the
church
on
the
necessity
of
such
a
belief
to
morality
and
the
order
of
society
on
the
evidence
of
an
historical
fact
and
also
on
analogies
and
figures
of
speech
which
filled
up
the
void
or
gave
an
expression
in
words
to
a
cherished
instinct
the
mass
of
mankind
went
on
their
way
busy
with
the
affairs
of
this
life
hardly
stopping
to
think
about
another
but
in
our
own
day
the
question
has
been
reopened
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
belief
which
in
the
first
ages
of
christianity
was
the
strongest
motive
of
action
can
survive
the
conflict
with
a
scientific
age
in
which
the
rules
of
evidence
are
stricter
and
the
mind
has
become
more
sensitive
to
criticism
it
has
faded
into
the
distance
by
a
natural
process
as
it
was
removed
further
and
further
from
the
historical
fact
on
which
it
has
been
supposed
to
rest
arguments
derived
from
material
things
such
as
the
seed
and
the
ear
of
corn
or
transitions
in
the
life
of
animals
from
one
state
of
being
to
another
the
chrysalis
and
the
butterfly
are
not
pari
materia
with
arguments
from
the
visible
to
the
invisible
and
are
therefore
felt
to
be
no
longer
applicable
the
evidence
to
the
historical
fact
seems
to
be
weaker
than
was
once
supposed
it
is
not
consistent
with
itself
and
is
based
upon
documents
which
are
of
unknown
origin
the
immortality
of
man
must
be
proved
by
other
arguments
than
these
if
it
is
again
to
become
a
living
belief
we
must
ask
ourselves
afresh
why
we
still
maintain
it
and
seek
to
discover
a
foundation
for
it
in
the
nature
of
god
and
in
the
first
principles
of
morality
at
the
outset
of
the
discussion
we
may
clear
away
a
confusion
we
certainly
do
not
mean
by
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
immortality
of
fame
which
whether
worth
having
or
not
can
only
be
ascribed
to
a
very
select
class
of
the
whole
race
of
mankind
and
even
the
interest
in
these
few
is
comparatively
to
have
been
a
benefactor
to
the
world
whether
in
a
higher
or
a
lower
sphere
of
life
and
thought
is
a
great
thing
to
have
the
reputation
of
being
one
when
men
have
passed
out
of
the
sphere
of
earthly
praise
or
blame
is
hardly
worthy
of
consideration
the
memory
of
a
great
man
so
far
from
being
immortal
is
really
limited
to
his
own
generation
so
long
as
his
friends
or
his
disciples
are
alive
so
long
as
his
books
continue
to
be
read
so
long
as
his
political
or
military
successes
fill
a
page
in
the
history
of
his
country
the
praises
which
are
bestowed
upon
him
at
his
death
hardly
last
longer
than
the
flowers
which
are
strewed
upon
his
coffin
or
the
which
are
laid
upon
his
tomb
literature
makes
the
most
of
its
heroes
but
the
true
man
is
well
aware
that
far
from
enjoying
an
immortality
of
fame
in
a
generation
or
two
or
even
in
a
much
shorter
time
he
will
be
forgotten
and
the
world
will
get
on
without
him
modern
philosophy
is
perplexed
at
this
whole
question
which
is
sometimes
fairly
given
up
and
handed
over
to
the
realm
of
faith
the
perplexity
should
not
be
forgotten
by
us
when
we
attempt
to
submit
the
phaedo
of
plato
to
the
requirements
of
logic
for
what
idea
can
we
form
of
the
soul
when
separated
from
the
body
or
how
can
the
soul
be
united
with
the
body
and
still
be
independent
is
the
soul
related
to
the
body
as
the
ideal
to
the
real
or
as
the
whole
to
the
parts
or
as
the
subject
to
the
object
or
as
the
cause
to
the
effect
or
as
the
end
to
the
means
shall
we
say
with
aristotle
that
the
soul
is
the
entelechy
or
form
of
an
organized
living
body
or
with
plato
that
she
has
a
life
of
her
own
is
the
pythagorean
image
of
the
harmony
or
that
of
the
monad
the
truer
expression
is
the
soul
related
to
the
body
as
sight
to
the
eye
or
as
the
boatman
to
his
boat
arist
de
anim
and
in
another
state
of
being
is
the
soul
to
be
conceived
of
as
vanishing
into
infinity
hardly
possessing
an
existence
which
she
can
call
her
own
as
in
the
pantheistic
system
of
spinoza
or
as
an
individual
informing
another
body
and
entering
into
new
relations
but
retaining
her
own
character
compare
gorgias
or
is
the
opposition
of
soul
and
body
a
mere
illusion
and
the
true
self
neither
soul
nor
body
but
the
union
of
the
two
in
the
which
is
above
them
and
is
death
the
assertion
of
this
individuality
in
the
higher
nature
and
the
falling
away
into
nothingness
of
the
lower
or
are
we
vainly
attempting
to
pass
the
boundaries
of
human
thought
the
body
and
the
soul
seem
to
be
inseparable
not
only
in
fact
but
in
our
conceptions
of
them
and
any
philosophy
which
too
closely
unites
them
or
too
widely
separates
them
either
in
this
life
or
in
another
disturbs
the
balance
of
human
nature
no
thinker
has
perfectly
adjusted
them
or
been
entirely
consistent
with
himself
in
describing
their
relation
to
one
another
nor
can
we
wonder
that
plato
in
the
infancy
of
human
thought
should
have
confused
mythology
and
philosophy
or
have
mistaken
verbal
arguments
for
real
ones
again
believing
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
we
must
still
ask
the
question
of
socrates
is
that
which
we
suppose
to
be
immortal
is
it
the
personal
and
individual
element
in
us
or
the
spiritual
and
universal
is
it
the
principle
of
knowledge
or
of
goodness
or
the
union
of
the
two
is
it
the
mere
force
of
life
which
is
determined
to
be
or
the
consciousness
of
self
which
can
not
be
got
rid
of
or
the
fire
of
genius
which
refuses
to
be
extinguished
or
is
there
a
hidden
being
which
is
allied
to
the
author
of
all
existence
who
is
because
he
is
perfect
and
to
whom
our
ideas
of
perfection
give
us
a
title
to
belong
whatever
answer
is
given
by
us
to
these
questions
there
still
remains
the
necessity
of
allowing
the
permanence
of
evil
if
not
for
ever
at
any
rate
for
a
time
in
order
that
the
wicked
not
have
too
good
a
bargain
for
the
annihilation
of
evil
at
death
or
the
eternal
duration
of
it
seem
to
involve
equal
difficulties
in
the
moral
government
of
the
universe
sometimes
we
are
led
by
our
feelings
rather
than
by
our
reason
to
think
of
the
good
and
wise
only
as
existing
in
another
life
why
should
the
mean
the
weak
the
idiot
the
infant
the
herd
of
men
who
have
never
in
any
proper
sense
the
use
of
reason
reappear
with
blinking
eyes
in
the
light
of
another
world
but
our
second
thought
is
that
the
hope
of
humanity
is
a
common
one
and
that
all
or
none
will
be
partakers
of
immortality
reason
does
not
allow
us
to
suppose
that
we
have
any
greater
claims
than
others
and
experience
may
often
reveal
to
us
unexpected
flashes
of
the
higher
nature
in
those
whom
we
had
despised
why
should
the
wicked
suffer
any
more
than
ourselves
had
we
been
placed
in
their
circumstances
should
we
have
been
any
better
than
they
the
worst
of
men
are
objects
of
pity
rather
than
of
anger
to
the
philanthropist
must
they
not
be
equally
such
to
divine
benevolence
even
more
than
the
good
they
have
need
of
another
life
not
that
they
may
be
punished
but
that
they
may
be
educated
these
are
a
few
of
the
reflections
which
arise
in
our
minds
when
we
attempt
to
assign
any
form
to
our
conceptions
of
a
future
state
there
are
some
other
questions
which
are
disturbing
to
us
because
we
have
no
answer
to
them
what
is
to
become
of
the
animals
in
a
future
state
have
we
not
seen
dogs
more
faithful
and
intelligent
than
men
and
men
who
are
more
stupid
and
brutal
than
any
animals
does
their
life
cease
at
death
or
is
there
some
thing
reserved
also
for
them
they
may
be
said
to
have
a
shadow
or
imitation
of
morality
and
imperfect
moral
claims
upon
the
benevolence
of
man
and
upon
the
justice
of
god
we
can
not
think
of
the
least
or
lowest
of
them
the
insect
the
bird
the
inhabitants
of
the
sea
or
the
desert
as
having
any
place
in
a
future
world
and
if
not
all
why
should
those
who
are
specially
attached
to
man
be
deemed
worthy
of
any
exceptional
privilege
when
we
reason
about
such
a
subject
almost
at
once
we
degenerate
into
nonsense
it
is
a
passing
thought
which
has
no
real
hold
on
the
mind
we
may
argue
for
the
existence
of
animals
in
a
future
state
from
the
attributes
of
god
or
from
texts
of
scripture
not
two
sparrows
sold
for
one
farthing
etc
but
the
truth
is
that
we
are
only
filling
up
the
void
of
another
world
with
our
own
fancies
again
we
often
talk
about
the
origin
of
evil
that
great
bugbear
of
theologians
by
which
they
frighten
us
into
believing
any
superstition
what
answer
can
be
made
to
the
old
commonplace
not
god
the
author
of
evil
if
he
knowingly
permitted
but
could
have
prevented
it
even
if
we
assume
that
the
inequalities
of
this
life
are
rectified
by
some
transposition
of
human
beings
in
another
still
the
existence
of
the
very
least
evil
if
it
could
have
been
avoided
seems
to
be
at
variance
with
the
love
and
justice
of
god
and
so
we
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
we
are
carrying
logic
too
far
and
that
the
attempt
to
frame
the
world
according
to
a
rule
of
divine
perfection
is
opposed
to
experience
and
had
better
be
given
up
the
case
of
the
animals
is
our
own
we
must
admit
that
the
divine
being
although
perfect
himself
has
placed
us
in
a
state
of
life
in
which
we
may
work
together
with
him
for
good
but
we
are
very
far
from
having
attained
to
it
again
ideas
must
be
given
through
something
and
we
are
always
prone
to
argue
about
the
soul
from
analogies
of
outward
things
which
may
serve
to
embody
our
thoughts
but
are
also
partly
delusive
for
we
can
not
reason
from
the
natural
to
the
spiritual
or
from
the
outward
to
the
inward
the
progress
of
physiological
science
without
bringing
us
nearer
to
the
great
secret
has
tended
to
remove
some
erroneous
notions
respecting
the
relations
of
body
and
mind
and
in
this
we
have
the
advantage
of
the
ancients
but
no
one
imagines
that
any
seed
of
immortality
is
to
be
discerned
in
our
mortal
frames
most
people
have
been
content
to
rest
their
belief
in
another
life
on
the
agreement
of
the
more
enlightened
part
of
mankind
and
on
the
inseparable
connection
of
such
a
doctrine
with
the
existence
of
a
god
also
in
a
less
degree
on
the
impossibility
of
doubting
about
the
continued
existence
of
those
whom
we
love
and
reverence
in
this
world
and
after
all
has
been
said
the
figure
the
analogy
the
argument
are
felt
to
be
only
approximations
in
different
forms
to
an
expression
of
the
common
sentiment
of
the
human
heart
that
we
shall
live
again
is
far
more
certain
than
that
we
shall
take
any
particular
form
of
life
when
we
speak
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
we
must
ask
further
what
we
mean
by
the
word
immortality
for
of
the
duration
of
a
living
being
in
countless
ages
we
can
form
no
conception
far
less
than
a
three
years
old
child
of
the
whole
of
life
the
naked
eye
might
as
well
try
to
see
the
furthest
star
in
the
infinity
of
heaven
whether
time
and
space
really
exist
when
we
take
away
the
limits
of
them
may
be
doubted
at
any
rate
the
thought
of
them
when
unlimited
us
so
overwhelming
to
us
as
to
lose
all
distinctness
philosophers
have
spoken
of
them
as
forms
of
the
human
mind
but
what
is
the
mind
without
them
as
then
infinite
time
or
an
existence
out
of
time
which
are
the
only
possible
explanations
of
eternal
duration
are
equally
inconceivable
to
us
let
us
substitute
for
them
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
years
after
death
and
ask
not
what
will
be
our
employment
in
eternity
but
what
will
happen
to
us
in
that
definite
portion
of
time
or
what
is
now
happening
to
those
who
passed
out
of
life
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
years
ago
do
we
imagine
that
the
wicked
are
suffering
torments
or
that
the
good
are
singing
the
praises
of
god
during
a
period
longer
than
that
of
a
whole
life
or
of
ten
lives
of
men
is
the
suffering
physical
or
mental
and
does
the
worship
of
god
consist
only
of
praise
or
of
many
forms
of
service
who
are
the
wicked
and
who
are
the
good
whom
we
venture
to
divide
by
a
hard
and
fast
line
and
in
which
of
the
two
classes
should
we
place
ourselves
and
our
friends
may
we
not
suspect
that
we
are
making
differences
of
kind
because
we
are
unable
to
imagine
differences
of
degree
putting
the
whole
human
race
into
heaven
or
hell
for
the
greater
convenience
of
logical
division
are
we
not
at
the
same
time
describing
them
both
in
superlatives
only
that
we
may
satisfy
the
demands
of
rhetoric
what
is
that
pain
which
does
not
become
deadened
after
a
thousand
years
or
what
is
the
nature
of
that
pleasure
or
happiness
which
never
wearies
by
monotony
earthly
pleasures
and
pains
are
short
in
proportion
as
they
are
keen
of
any
others
which
are
both
intense
and
lasting
we
have
no
experience
and
can
form
no
idea
the
words
or
figures
of
speech
which
we
use
are
not
consistent
with
themselves
for
are
we
not
imagining
heaven
under
the
similitude
of
a
church
and
hell
as
a
prison
or
perhaps
a
madhouse
or
chamber
of
horrors
and
yet
to
beings
constituted
as
we
are
the
monotony
of
singing
psalms
would
be
as
great
an
infliction
as
the
pains
of
hell
and
might
be
even
pleasantly
interrupted
by
them
where
are
the
actions
worthy
of
rewards
greater
than
those
which
are
conferred
on
the
greatest
benefactors
of
mankind
and
where
are
the
crimes
which
according
to
plato
merciful
reckoning
more
merciful
at
any
rate
than
the
eternal
damnation
of
christian
teachers
for
every
ten
years
in
this
life
deserve
a
hundred
of
punishment
in
the
life
to
come
we
should
be
ready
to
die
of
pity
if
we
could
see
the
least
of
the
sufferings
which
the
writers
of
infernos
and
purgatorios
have
attributed
to
the
damned
yet
these
joys
and
terrors
seem
hardly
to
exercise
an
appreciable
influence
over
the
lives
of
men
the
wicked
man
when
old
is
not
as
plato
supposes
republic
more
agitated
by
the
terrors
of
another
world
when
he
is
nearer
to
them
nor
the
good
in
an
ecstasy
at
the
joys
of
which
he
is
soon
to
be
the
partaker
age
numbs
the
sense
of
both
worlds
and
the
habit
of
life
is
strongest
in
death
even
the
dying
mother
is
dreaming
of
her
lost
children
as
they
were
forty
or
fifty
years
before
over
the
boards
not
of
reunion
with
them
in
another
state
of
being
most
persons
when
the
last
hour
comes
are
resigned
to
the
order
of
nature
and
the
will
of
god
they
are
not
thinking
of
dante
inferno
or
paradiso
or
of
the
pilgrim
progress
heaven
and
hell
are
not
realities
to
them
but
words
or
ideas
the
outward
symbols
of
some
great
mystery
they
hardly
know
what
many
noble
poems
and
pictures
have
been
suggested
by
the
traditional
representations
of
them
which
have
been
fixed
in
forms
of
art
and
can
no
longer
be
altered
many
sermons
have
been
filled
with
descriptions
of
celestial
or
infernal
mansions
but
hardly
even
in
childhood
did
the
thought
of
heaven
and
hell
supply
the
motives
of
our
actions
or
at
any
time
seriously
affect
the
substance
of
our
belief
another
life
must
be
described
if
at
all
in
forms
of
thought
and
not
of
sense
to
draw
pictures
of
heaven
and
hell
whether
in
the
language
of
scripture
or
any
other
adds
nothing
to
our
real
knowledge
but
may
perhaps
disguise
our
ignorance
the
truest
conception
which
we
can
form
of
a
future
life
is
a
state
of
progress
or
education
a
progress
from
evil
to
good
from
ignorance
to
knowledge
to
this
we
are
led
by
the
analogy
of
the
present
life
in
which
we
see
different
races
and
nations
of
men
and
different
men
and
women
of
the
same
nation
in
various
states
or
stages
of
cultivation
some
more
and
some
less
developed
and
all
of
them
capable
of
improvement
under
favourable
circumstances
there
are
punishments
too
of
children
when
they
are
growing
up
inflicted
by
their
parents
of
elder
offenders
which
are
imposed
by
the
law
of
the
land
of
all
men
at
all
times
of
life
which
are
attached
by
the
laws
of
nature
to
the
performance
of
certain
actions
all
these
punishments
are
really
educational
that
is
to
say
they
are
not
intended
to
retaliate
on
the
offender
but
to
teach
him
a
lesson
also
there
is
an
element
of
chance
in
them
which
is
another
name
for
our
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
nature
there
is
evil
too
inseparable
from
good
compare
lysis
not
always
punished
here
as
good
is
not
always
rewarded
it
is
capable
of
being
indefinitely
diminished
and
as
knowledge
increases
the
element
of
chance
may
more
and
more
disappear
for
we
do
not
argue
merely
from
the
analogy
of
the
present
state
of
this
world
to
another
but
from
the
analogy
of
a
probable
future
to
which
we
are
tending
the
greatest
changes
of
which
we
have
had
experience
as
yet
are
due
to
our
increasing
knowledge
of
history
and
of
nature
they
have
been
produced
by
a
few
minds
appearing
in
three
or
four
favoured
nations
in
a
comparatively
short
period
of
time
may
we
be
allowed
to
imagine
the
minds
of
men
everywhere
working
together
during
many
ages
for
the
completion
of
our
knowledge
may
not
the
science
of
physiology
transform
the
world
again
the
majority
of
mankind
have
really
experienced
some
moral
improvement
almost
every
one
feels
that
he
has
tendencies
to
good
and
is
capable
of
becoming
better
and
these
germs
of
good
are
often
found
to
be
developed
by
new
circumstances
like
stunted
trees
when
transplanted
to
a
better
soil
the
differences
between
the
savage
and
the
civilized
man
or
between
the
civilized
man
in
old
and
new
countries
may
be
indefinitely
increased
the
first
difference
is
the
effect
of
a
few
thousand
the
second
of
a
few
hundred
years
we
congratulate
ourselves
that
slavery
has
become
industry
that
law
and
constitutional
government
have
superseded
despotism
and
violence
that
an
ethical
religion
has
taken
the
place
of
fetichism
there
may
yet
come
a
time
when
the
many
may
be
as
well
off
as
the
few
when
no
one
will
be
weighed
down
by
excessive
toil
when
the
necessity
of
providing
for
the
body
will
not
interfere
with
mental
improvement
when
the
physical
frame
may
be
strengthened
and
developed
and
the
religion
of
all
men
may
become
a
reasonable
service
nothing
therefore
either
in
the
present
state
of
man
or
in
the
tendencies
of
the
future
as
far
as
we
can
entertain
conjecture
of
them
would
lead
us
to
suppose
that
god
governs
us
vindictively
in
this
world
and
therefore
we
have
no
reason
to
infer
that
he
will
govern
us
vindictively
in
another
the
true
argument
from
analogy
is
not
life
is
a
mixed
state
of
justice
and
injustice
of
great
waste
of
sudden
casualties
of
disproportionate
punishments
and
therefore
the
like
inconsistencies
irregularities
injustices
are
to
be
expected
in
another
but
life
is
subject
to
law
and
is
in
a
state
of
progress
and
therefore
law
and
progress
may
be
believed
to
be
the
governing
principles
of
another
all
the
analogies
of
this
world
would
be
against
unmeaning
punishments
inflicted
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
years
after
an
offence
had
been
committed
suffering
there
might
be
as
a
part
of
education
but
not
hopeless
or
protracted
as
there
might
be
a
retrogression
of
individuals
or
of
bodies
of
men
yet
not
such
as
to
interfere
with
a
plan
for
the
improvement
of
the
whole
compare
laws
but
some
one
will
say
that
we
can
not
reason
from
the
seen
to
the
unseen
and
that
we
are
creating
another
world
after
the
image
of
this
just
as
men
in
former
ages
have
created
gods
in
their
own
likeness
and
we
like
the
companions
of
socrates
may
feel
discouraged
at
hearing
our
favourite
from
analogy
thus
summarily
disposed
of
like
himself
too
we
may
adduce
other
arguments
in
which
he
seems
to
have
anticipated
us
though
he
expresses
them
in
different
language
for
we
feel
that
the
soul
partakes
of
the
ideal
and
invisible
and
can
never
fall
into
the
error
of
confusing
the
external
circumstances
of
man
with
his
higher
self
or
his
origin
with
his
nature
it
is
as
repugnant
to
us
as
it
was
to
him
to
imagine
that
our
moral
ideas
are
to
be
attributed
only
to
cerebral
forces
the
value
of
a
human
soul
like
the
value
of
a
man
life
to
himself
is
inestimable
and
can
not
be
reckoned
in
earthly
or
material
things
the
human
being
alone
has
the
consciousness
of
truth
and
justice
and
love
which
is
the
consciousness
of
god
and
the
soul
becoming
more
conscious
of
these
becomes
more
conscious
of
her
own
immortality
the
last
ground
of
our
belief
in
immortality
and
the
strongest
is
the
perfection
of
the
divine
nature
the
mere
fact
of
the
existence
of
god
does
not
tend
to
show
the
continued
existence
of
man
an
evil
god
or
an
indifferent
god
might
have
had
the
power
but
not
the
will
to
preserve
us
he
might
have
regarded
us
as
fitted
to
minister
to
his
service
by
a
succession
of
existences
like
the
animals
without
attributing
to
each
soul
an
incomparable
value
but
if
he
is
perfect
he
must
will
that
all
rational
beings
should
partake
of
that
perfection
which
he
himself
is
in
the
words
of
the
timaeus
he
is
good
and
therefore
he
desires
that
all
other
things
should
be
as
like
himself
as
possible
and
the
manner
in
which
he
accomplishes
this
is
by
permitting
evil
or
rather
degrees
of
good
which
are
otherwise
called
evil
for
all
progress
is
good
relatively
to
the
past
and
yet
may
be
comparatively
evil
when
regarded
in
the
light
of
the
future
good
and
evil
are
relative
terms
and
degrees
of
evil
are
merely
the
negative
aspect
of
degrees
of
good
of
the
absolute
goodness
of
any
finite
nature
we
can
form
no
conception
we
are
all
of
us
in
process
of
transition
from
one
degree
of
good
or
evil
to
another
the
difficulties
which
are
urged
about
the
origin
or
existence
of
evil
are
mere
dialectical
puzzles
standing
in
the
same
relation
to
christian
philosophy
as
the
puzzles
of
the
cynics
and
megarians
to
the
philosophy
of
plato
they
arise
out
of
the
tendency
of
the
human
mind
to
regard
good
and
evil
both
as
relative
and
absolute
just
as
the
riddles
about
motion
are
to
be
explained
by
the
double
conception
of
space
or
matter
which
the
human
mind
has
the
power
of
regarding
either
as
continuous
or
discrete
in
speaking
of
divine
perfection
we
mean
to
say
that
god
is
just
and
true
and
loving
the
author
of
order
and
not
of
disorder
of
good
and
not
of
evil
or
rather
that
he
is
justice
that
he
is
truth
that
he
is
love
that
he
is
order
that
he
is
the
very
progress
of
which
we
were
speaking
and
that
wherever
these
qualities
are
present
whether
in
the
human
soul
or
in
the
order
of
nature
there
is
god
we
might
still
see
him
everywhere
if
we
had
not
been
mistakenly
seeking
for
him
apart
from
us
instead
of
in
us
away
from
the
laws
of
nature
instead
of
in
them
and
we
become
united
to
him
not
by
mystical
absorption
but
by
partaking
whether
consciously
or
unconsciously
of
that
truth
and
justice
and
love
which
he
himself
is
thus
the
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
rests
at
last
on
the
belief
in
god
if
there
is
a
good
and
wise
god
then
there
is
a
progress
of
mankind
towards
perfection
and
if
there
is
no
progress
of
men
towards
perfection
then
there
is
no
good
and
wise
god
we
can
not
suppose
that
the
moral
government
of
god
of
which
we
see
the
beginnings
in
the
world
and
in
ourselves
will
cease
when
we
pass
out
of
life
considering
the
of
the
human
faculties
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
subject
we
are
inclined
to
believe
that
the
fewer
our
words
the
better
at
the
approach
of
death
there
is
not
much
said
good
men
are
too
honest
to
go
out
of
the
world
professing
more
than
they
know
there
is
perhaps
no
important
subject
about
which
at
any
time
even
religious
people
speak
so
little
to
one
another
in
the
fulness
of
life
the
thought
of
death
is
mostly
awakened
by
the
sight
or
recollection
of
the
death
of
others
rather
than
by
the
prospect
of
our
own
we
must
also
acknowledge
that
there
are
degrees
of
the
belief
in
immortality
and
many
forms
in
which
it
presents
itself
to
the
mind
some
persons
will
say
no
more
than
that
they
trust
in
god
and
that
they
leave
all
to
him
it
is
a
great
part
of
true
religion
not
to
pretend
to
know
more
than
we
do
others
when
they
quit
this
world
are
comforted
with
the
hope
they
will
see
and
know
their
friends
in
heaven
but
it
is
better
to
leave
them
in
the
hands
of
god
and
to
be
assured
that
evil
shall
touch
them
there
are
others
again
to
whom
the
belief
in
a
divine
personality
has
ceased
to
have
any
longer
a
meaning
yet
they
are
satisfied
that
the
end
of
all
is
not
here
but
that
something
still
remains
to
us
some
better
thing
for
the
good
than
for
the
evil
they
are
persuaded
in
spite
of
their
theological
nihilism
that
the
ideas
of
justice
and
truth
and
holiness
and
love
are
realities
they
cherish
an
enthusiastic
devotion
to
the
first
principles
of
morality
through
these
they
see
or
seem
to
see
darkly
and
in
a
figure
that
the
soul
is
immortal
but
besides
differences
of
theological
opinion
which
must
ever
prevail
about
things
unseen
the
hope
of
immortality
is
weaker
or
stronger
in
men
at
one
time
of
life
than
at
another
it
even
varies
from
day
to
day
it
comes
and
goes
the
mind
like
the
sky
is
apt
to
be
overclouded
other
generations
of
men
may
have
sometimes
lived
under
an
of
faith
to
us
the
total
disappearance
of
it
might
be
compared
to
the
falling
from
heaven
and
we
may
sometimes
have
to
begin
again
and
acquire
the
belief
for
ourselves
or
to
win
it
back
again
when
it
is
lost
it
is
really
weakest
in
the
hour
of
death
for
nature
like
a
kind
mother
or
nurse
lays
us
to
sleep
without
frightening
us
physicians
who
are
the
witnesses
of
such
scenes
say
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
there
is
no
fear
of
the
future
often
as
plato
tells
us
death
is
accompanied
pleasure
tim
when
the
end
is
still
uncertain
the
cry
of
many
a
one
has
been
that
i
may
be
taken
the
last
thoughts
even
of
the
best
men
depend
chiefly
on
the
accidents
of
their
bodily
state
pain
soon
overpowers
the
desire
of
life
old
age
like
the
child
is
laid
to
sleep
almost
in
a
moment
the
long
experience
of
life
will
often
destroy
the
interest
which
mankind
have
in
it
so
various
are
the
feelings
with
which
different
persons
draw
near
to
death
and
still
more
various
the
forms
in
which
imagination
clothes
it
for
this
alternation
of
feeling
compare
the
old
testament
psalm
vi
isaiah
eccles
when
we
think
of
god
and
of
man
in
his
relation
to
god
of
the
imperfection
of
our
present
state
and
yet
of
the
progress
which
is
observable
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
of
the
human
mind
of
the
depth
and
power
of
our
moral
ideas
which
seem
to
partake
of
the
very
nature
of
god
himself
when
we
consider
the
contrast
between
the
physical
laws
to
which
we
are
subject
and
the
higher
law
which
raises
us
above
them
and
is
yet
a
part
of
them
when
we
reflect
on
our
capacity
of
becoming
the
of
all
time
and
all
existence
and
of
framing
in
our
own
minds
the
ideal
of
a
perfect
being
when
we
see
how
the
human
mind
in
all
the
higher
religions
of
the
world
including
buddhism
notwithstanding
some
aberrations
has
tended
towards
such
a
belief
we
have
reason
to
think
that
our
destiny
is
different
from
that
of
animals
and
though
we
can
not
altogether
shut
out
the
childish
fear
that
the
soul
upon
leaving
the
body
may
into
thin
air
we
have
still
so
far
as
the
nature
of
the
subject
admits
a
hope
of
immortality
with
which
we
comfort
ourselves
on
sufficient
grounds
the
denial
of
the
belief
takes
the
heart
out
of
human
life
it
lowers
men
to
the
level
of
the
material
as
goethe
also
says
is
dead
even
in
this
world
who
has
no
belief
in
another
it
is
well
also
that
we
should
sometimes
think
of
the
forms
of
thought
under
which
the
idea
of
immortality
is
most
naturally
presented
to
us
it
is
clear
that
to
our
minds
the
risen
soul
can
no
longer
be
described
as
in
a
picture
by
the
symbol
of
a
creature
nor
in
any
other
form
of
sense
the
multitude
of
angels
as
in
milton
singing
the
almighty
praises
are
a
noble
image
and
may
furnish
a
theme
for
the
poet
or
the
painter
but
they
are
no
longer
an
adequate
expression
of
the
kingdom
of
god
which
is
within
us
neither
is
there
any
mansion
in
this
world
or
another
in
which
the
departed
can
be
imagined
to
dwell
and
carry
on
their
occupations
when
this
earthly
tabernacle
is
dissolved
no
other
habitation
or
building
can
take
them
in
it
is
in
the
language
of
ideas
only
that
we
speak
of
them
first
of
all
there
is
the
thought
of
rest
and
freedom
from
pain
they
have
gone
home
as
the
common
saying
is
and
the
cares
of
this
world
touch
them
no
more
secondly
we
may
imagine
them
as
they
were
at
their
best
and
brightest
humbly
fulfilling
their
daily
round
of
duties
selfless
childlike
unaffected
by
the
world
when
the
eye
was
single
and
the
whole
body
seemed
to
be
full
of
light
when
the
mind
was
clear
and
saw
into
the
purposes
of
god
thirdly
we
may
think
of
them
as
possessed
by
a
great
love
of
god
and
man
working
out
his
will
at
a
further
stage
in
the
heavenly
pilgrimage
and
yet
we
acknowledge
that
these
are
the
things
which
eye
hath
not
seen
nor
ear
heard
and
therefore
it
hath
not
entered
into
the
heart
of
man
in
any
sensible
manner
to
conceive
them
fourthly
there
may
have
been
some
moments
in
our
own
lives
when
we
have
risen
above
ourselves
or
been
conscious
of
our
truer
selves
in
which
the
will
of
god
has
superseded
our
wills
and
we
have
entered
into
communion
with
him
and
been
partakers
for
a
brief
season
of
the
divine
truth
and
love
in
which
like
christ
we
have
been
inspired
to
utter
the
prayer
in
them
and
thou
in
me
that
we
may
be
all
made
perfect
in
one
these
precious
moments
if
we
have
ever
known
them
are
the
nearest
approach
which
we
can
make
to
the
idea
of
immortality
returning
now
to
the
earlier
stage
of
human
thought
which
is
represented
by
the
writings
of
plato
we
find
that
many
of
the
same
questions
have
already
arisen
there
is
the
same
tendency
to
materialism
the
same
inconsistency
in
the
application
of
the
idea
of
mind
the
same
doubt
whether
the
soul
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
cause
or
as
an
effect
the
same
falling
back
on
moral
convictions
in
the
phaedo
the
soul
is
conscious
of
her
divine
nature
and
the
separation
from
the
body
which
has
been
commenced
in
this
life
is
perfected
in
another
beginning
in
mystery
socrates
in
the
intermediate
part
of
the
dialogue
attempts
to
bring
the
doctrine
of
a
future
life
into
connection
with
his
theory
of
knowledge
in
proportion
as
he
succeeds
in
this
the
individual
seems
to
disappear
in
a
more
general
notion
of
the
soul
the
contemplation
of
ideas
the
form
of
eternity
takes
the
place
of
past
and
future
states
of
existence
his
language
may
be
compared
to
that
of
some
modern
philosophers
who
speak
of
eternity
not
in
the
sense
of
perpetual
duration
of
time
but
as
an
quality
of
the
soul
yet
at
the
conclusion
of
the
dialogue
having
at
the
end
of
the
intellectual
world
republic
he
replaces
the
veil
of
mythology
and
describes
the
soul
and
her
attendant
genius
in
the
language
of
the
mysteries
or
of
a
disciple
of
zoroaster
nor
can
we
fairly
demand
of
plato
a
consistency
which
is
wanting
among
ourselves
who
acknowledge
that
another
world
is
beyond
the
range
of
human
thought
and
yet
are
always
seeking
to
represent
the
mansions
of
heaven
or
hell
in
the
colours
of
the
painter
or
in
the
descriptions
of
the
poet
or
rhetorician
the
doctrine
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
was
not
new
to
the
greeks
in
the
age
of
socrates
but
like
the
unity
of
god
had
a
foundation
in
the
popular
belief
the
old
homeric
notion
of
a
gibbering
ghost
flitting
away
to
hades
or
of
a
few
illustrious
heroes
enjoying
the
isles
of
the
blest
or
of
an
existence
divided
between
the
two
or
the
hesiodic
of
righteous
spirits
who
become
guardian
angels
had
given
place
in
the
mysteries
and
the
orphic
poets
to
representations
partly
fanciful
of
a
future
state
of
rewards
and
punishments
laws
the
reticence
of
the

occasions

in

part
of
their
literature
respecting
this
religion
is
not
to
be
taken
as
a
measure
of
the
diffusion
of
such
beliefs
if
pericles
in
the
funeral
oration
is
silent
on
the
consolations
of
immortality
the
poet
pindar
and
the
tragedians
on

assume
the
continued
existence
of
the

is
deeply
set
in

in
the

there
is
also
a

to
the
common
sentiment
the
ionian
and
pythagorean
philosophies
arose
and
some
new
elements
were
added
to
the
popular
belief
the
individual
must
find
an
expression
as
well
as
the
world
either
the
soul
was
supposed
to
exist
in
the
form
of
a
magnet
or
of

of

or

and

attained
the
pure
abstraction
and
this
like
the
other
abstractions
of
greek
philosophy
sank
deep
into
the
human
intelligence
the
opposition
of
the
intelligible
and
the
sensible
and
of
god
to
the
world
supplied
an
analogy
which
assisted
in
the
separation
of
soul
and
body
if
ideas
were
separable
from
phenomena
mind
was
also
separable
from
matter
if
the
ideas
were
eternal
the
mind
that
conceived
them
was
eternal
too
as
the
unity
of
god
was
more
distinctly
acknowledged
the
conception
of
the
human
soul
became
more
developed
the
succession
or
alternation
of
life
and
death
had
occurred
to
heracleitus
the
eleatic
parmenides
had
stumbled
upon
the
modern
thesis
that
and
being
are
the
same
the
eastern
belief
in
transmigration
defined
the
sense
of
individuality
and
some
like
empedocles
fancied
that
the
blood
which
they
had
shed
in
another
state
of
being
was
crying
against
them
and
that
for
thirty
thousand
years
they
were
to
be
and
vagabonds
upon
the
earth
the
desire
of
recognizing
a
lost
mother
or
love
or
friend
in
the
world
below
phaedo
was
a
natural
feeling
which
in
that
age
as
well
as
in
every
other
has
given
distinctness
to
the
hope
of
immortality
nor
were
ethical
considerations
wanting
partly
derived
from
the
necessity
of
punishing
the
greater
sort
of
criminals
whom
no
avenging
power
of
this
world
could
reach
the
voice
of
conscience
too
was
heard
reminding
the
good
man
that
he
was
not
altogether
innocent
republic
to
these
indistinct
longings
and
fears
an
expression
was
given
in
the
mysteries
and
orphic
poets
a
of
books
republic
passing
under
the
names
of
musaeus
and
orpheus
in
plato
time
were
filled
with
notions
of
an
yet
after
all
the
belief
in
the
individuality
of
the
soul
after
death
had
but
a
feeble
hold
on
the
greek
mind
like
the
personality
of
god
the
personality
of
man
in
a
future
state
was
not
inseparably
bound
up
with
the
reality
of
his
existence
for
the
distinction
between
the
personal
and
impersonal
and
also
between
the
divine
and
human
was
far
less
marked
to
the
greek
than
to
ourselves
and
as
plato
readily
passes
from
the
notion
of
the
good
to
that
of
god
he
also
passes
almost
imperceptibly
to
himself
and
his
reader
from
the
future
life
of
the
individual
soul
to
the
eternal
being
of
the
absolute
soul
there
has
been
a
clearer
statement
and
a
clearer
denial
of
the
belief
in
modern
times
than
is
found
in
early
greek
philosophy
and
hence
the
comparative
silence
on
the
whole
subject
which
is
often
remarked
in
ancient
writers
and
particularly
in
aristotle
for
plato
and
aristotle
are
not
further
removed
in
their
teaching
about
the
immortality
of
the
soul
than
they
are
in
their
theory
of
knowledge
living
in
an
age
when
logic
was
beginning
to
mould
human
thought
plato
naturally
cast
his
belief
in
immortality
into
a
logical
form
and
when
we
consider
how
much
the
doctrine
of
ideas
was
also
one
of
words
it
is
not
surprising
that
he
should
have
fallen
into
verbal
fallacies
early
logic
is
always
mistaking
the
truth
of
the
form
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
alternation
of
opposites
is
not
the
same
as
the
generation
of
them
out
of
each
other
and
that
the
generation
of
them
out
of
each
other
which
is
the
first
argument
in
the
phaedo
is
at
variance
with
their
mutual
exclusion
of
each
other
whether
in
themselves
or
in
us
which
is
the
last
for
even
if
we
admit
the
distinction
which
he
draws
between
the
opposites
and
the
things
which
have
the
opposites
still
individuals
fall
under
the
latter
class
and
we
have
to
pass
out
of
the
region
of
human
hopes
and
fears
to
a
conception
of
an
abstract
soul
which
is
the
impersonation
of
the
ideas
such
a
conception
which
in
plato
himself
is
but
half
expressed
is
unmeaning
to
us
and
relative
only
to
a
particular
stage
in
the
history
of
thought
the
doctrine
of
reminiscence
is
also
a
fragment
of
a
former
world
which
has
no
place
in
the
philosophy
of
modern
times
but
plato
had
the
wonders
of
psychology
just
opening
to
him
and
he
had
not
the
explanation
of
them
which
is
supplied
by
the
analysis
of
language
and
the
history
of
the
human
mind
the
question
come
our
abstract
ideas
he
could
only
answer
by
an
imaginary
hypothesis
nor
is
it
difficult
to
see
that
his
crowning
argument
is
purely
verbal
and
is
but
the
expression
of
an
instinctive
confidence
put
into
a
logical
form
soul
is
immortal
because
it
contains
a
principle
of
imperishableness
nor
does
he
himself
seem
at
all
to
be
aware
that
nothing
is
added
to
human
knowledge
by
his
and
simple
answer
that
beauty
is
the
cause
of
the
beautiful
and
that
he
is
merely
reasserting
the
eleatic
being
by
the
pythagorean
numbers
against
the
heracleitean
doctrine
of
perpetual
generation
the
answer
to
the
serious
question
of
generation
and
destruction
is
really
the
denial
of
them
for
this
he
would
substitute
as
in
the
republic
a
system
of
ideas
tested
not
by
experience
but
by
their
consequences
and
not
explained
by
actual
causes
but
by
a
higher
that
is
a
more
general
notion
consistency
with
themselves
is
the
only
test
which
is
to
be
applied
to
them
republic
and
phaedo
to
deal
fairly
with
such
arguments
they
should
be
translated
as
far
as
possible
into
their
modern
equivalents
the
ideas
of
men
are
eternal
their
souls
are
eternal
and
if
not
the
ideas
then
not
the
souls
such
an
argument
stands
nearly
in
the
same
relation
to
plato
and
his
age
as
the
argument
from
the
existence
of
god
to
immortality
among
ourselves
god
exists
then
the
soul
exists
after
death
and
if
there
is
no
god
there
is
no
existence
of
the
soul
after
death
for
the
ideas
are
to
his
mind
the
reality
the
truth
the
principle
of
permanence
as
well
as
of
intelligence
and
order
in
the
world
when
simmias
and
cebes
say
that
they
are
more
strongly
persuaded
of
the
existence
of
ideas
than
they
are
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
they
represent
fairly
enough
the
order
of
thought
in
greek
philosophy
and
we
might
say
in
the
same
way
that
we
are
more
certain
of
the
existence
of
god
than
we
are
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
are
led
by
the
belief
in
the
one
to
a
belief
in
the
other
the
parallel
as
socrates
would
say
is
not
perfect
but
agrees
in
as
far
as
the
mind
in
either
case
is
regarded
as
dependent
on
something
above
and
beyond
herself
the
analogy
may
even
be
pressed
a
step
further
are
more
certain
of
our
ideas
of
truth
and
right
than
we
are
of
the
existence
of
god
and
are
led
on
in
the
order
of
thought
from
one
to
the
other
or
more
correctly
existence
of
right
and
truth
is
the
existence
of
god
and
can
never
for
a
moment
be
separated
from
him
the
main
argument
of
the
phaedo
is
derived
from
the
existence
of
eternal
ideas
of
which
the
soul
is
a
partaker
the
other
argument
of
the
alternation
of
opposites
is
replaced
by
this
and
there
have
not
been
wanting
philosophers
of
the
idealist
school
who
have
imagined
that
the
doctrine
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
a
theory
of
knowledge
and
that
in
what
has
preceded
plato
is
accommodating
himself
to
the
popular
belief
such
a
view
can
only
be
elicited
from
the
phaedo
by
what
may
be
termed
the
transcendental
method
of
interpretation
and
is
obviously
inconsistent
with
the
gorgias
and
the
republic
those
who
maintain
it
are
immediately
compelled
to
renounce
the
shadow
which
they
have
grasped
as
a
play
of
words
only
but
the
truth
is
that
plato
in
his
argument
for
the
immortality
of
the
soul
has
collected
many
elements
of
proof
or
persuasion
ethical
and
mythological
as
well
as
dialectical
which
are
not
easily
to
be
reconciled
with
one
another
and
he
is
as
much
in
earnest
about
his
doctrine
of
retribution
which
is
repeated
in
all
his
more
ethical
writings
as
about
his
theory
of
knowledge
and
while
we
may
fairly
translate
the
dialectical
into
the
language
of
hegel
and
the
religious
and
mythological
into
the
language
of
dante
or
bunyan
the
ethical
speaks
to
us
still
in
the
same
voice
and
appeals
to
a
common
feeling
two
arguments
of
this
ethical
character
occur
in
the
phaedo
the
first
may
be
described
as
the
aspiration
of
the
soul
after
another
state
of
being
like
the
oriental
or
christian
mystic
the
philosopher
is
seeking
to
withdraw
from
impurities
of
sense
to
leave
the
world
and
the
things
of
the
world
and
to
find
his
higher
self
plato
recognizes
in
these
aspirations
the
foretaste
of
immortality
as
butler
and
addison
in
modern
times
have
argued
the
one
from
the
moral
tendencies
of
mankind
the
other
from
the
progress
of
the
soul
towards
perfection
in
using
this
argument
plato
has
certainly
confused
the
soul
which
has
left
the
body
with
the
soul
of
the
good
and
wise
compare
republic
such
a
confusion
was
natural
and
arose
partly
out
of
the
antithesis
of
soul
and
body
the
soul
in
her
own
essence
and
the
soul
upon
with
virtues
and
graces
were
easily
interchanged
with
one
another
because
on
a
subject
which
passes
expression
the
distinctions
of
language
can
hardly
be
maintained
the
ethical
proof
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
derived
from
the
necessity
of
retribution
the
wicked
would
be
too
well
off
if
their
evil
deeds
came
to
an
end
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
an
ardiaeus
an
archelaus
an
ismenias
could
ever
have
suffered
the
penalty
of
their
crimes
in
this
world
the
manner
in
which
this
retribution
is
accomplished
plato
represents
under
the
figures
of
mythology
doubtless
he
felt
that
it
was
easier
to
improve
than
to
invent
and
that
in
religion
especially
the
traditional
form
was
required
in
order
to
give
verisimilitude
to
the
myth
the
myth
too
is
far
more
probable
to
that
age
than
to
ours
and
may
fairly
be
regarded
as
guess
among
many
about
the
nature
of
the
earth
which
he
cleverly
supports
by
the
indications
of
geology
not
that
he
insists
on
the
absolute
truth
of
his
own
particular
notions
man
of
sense
will
be
confident
in
such
matters
but
he
will
be
confident
that
something
of
the
kind
is
true
as
in
other
passages
compare
crito
he
wins
belief
for
his
fictions
by
the
moderation
of
his
statements
he
does
not
like
dante
or
swedenborg
allow
himself
to
be
deceived
by
his
own
creations
the
dialogue
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
situation
and
first
of
all
we
are
struck
by
the
calmness
of
the
scene
like
the
spectators
at
the
time
we
can
not
pity
socrates
his
mien
and
his
language
are
so
noble
and
fearless
he
is
the
same
that
he
ever
was
but
milder
and
gentler
and
he
has
in
no
degree
lost
his
interest
in
dialectics
he
will
not
forego
the
delight
of
an
argument
in
compliance
with
the
jailer
intimation
that
he
should
not
heat
himself
with
talking
at
such
a
time
he
naturally
expresses
the
hope
of
his
life
that
he
has
been
a
true
mystic
and
not
a
mere
retainer
or
and
he
refers
to
passages
of
his
personal
history
to
his
old
enemies
the
comic
poets
and
to
the
proceedings
on
the
trial
he
alludes
playfully
but
he
vividly
remembers
the
disappointment
which
he
felt
in
reading
the
books
of
anaxagoras
the
return
of
xanthippe
and
his
children
indicates
that
the
philosopher
is
not
of
oak
or
rock
some
other
traits
of
his
character
may
be
noted
for
example
the
courteous
manner
in
which
he
inclines
his
head
to
the
last
objector
or
the
ironical
touch
already
as
the
tragic
poet
would
say
the
voice
of
fate
calls
or
the
depreciation
of
the
arguments
with
which
comforted
himself
and
them
or
his
fear
of
or
his
references
to
homer
or
the
playful
smile
with
which
he
like
a
book
about
greater
and
less
or
the
allusion
to
the
possibility
of
finding
another
teacher
among
barbarous
races
compare
polit
or
the
mysterious
reference
to
another
science
mathematics
of
generation
and
destruction
for
which
he
is
vainly
feeling
there
is
no
change
in
him
only
now
he
is
invested
with
a
sort
of
sacred
character
as
the
prophet
or
priest
of
apollo
the
god
of
the
festival
in
whose
honour
he
first
of
all
composes
a
hymn
and
then
like
the
swan
pours
forth
his
dying
lay
perhaps
the
extreme
elevation
of
socrates
above
his
own
situation
and
the
ordinary
interests
of
life
compare
his
jeu
about
his
burial
in
which
for
a
moment
he
puts
on
the
mask
create
in
the
mind
of
the
reader
an
impression
stronger
than
could
be
derived
from
arguments
that
such
a
one
has
in
him
principle
which
does
not
admit
of
death
the
other
persons
of
the
dialogue
may
be
considered
under
two
heads
private
friends
the
respondents
in
the
argument
first
there
is
crito
who
has
been
already
introduced
to
us
in
the
euthydemus
and
the
crito
he
is
the
equal
in
years
of
socrates
and
stands
in
quite
a
different
relation
to
him
from
his
younger
disciples
he
is
a
man
of
the
world
who
is
rich
and
prosperous
compare
the
jest
in
the
euthydemus
the
best
friend
of
socrates
who
wants
to
know
his
commands
in
whose
presence
he
talks
to
his
family
and
who
performs
the
last
duty
of
closing
his
eyes
it
is
observable
too
that
as
in
the
euthydemus
crito
shows
no
aptitude
for
philosophical
discussions
nor
among
the
friends
of
socrates
must
the
jailer
be
forgotten
who
seems
to
have
been
introduced
by
plato
in
order
to
show
the
impression
made
by
the
extraordinary
man
on
the
common
the
gentle
nature
of
the
man
is
indicated
by
his
weeping
at
the
announcement
of
his
errand
and
then
turning
away
and
also
by
the
words
of
socrates
to
his
disciples
charming
the
man
is
since
i
have
been
in
prison
he
has
been
always
coming
to
me
and
is
as
good
as
could
be
to
me
we
are
reminded
too
that
he
has
retained
this
gentle
nature
amid
scenes
of
death
and
violence
by
the
contrasts
which
he
draws
between
the
behaviour
of
socrates
and
of
others
when
about
to
die
another
person
who
takes
no
part
in
the
philosophical
discussion
is
the
excitable
apollodorus
the
same
who
in
the
symposium
of
which
he
is
the
narrator
is
called
madman
and
who
testifies
his
grief
by
the
most
violent
emotions
phaedo
is
also
present
the
as
he
may
be
termed
who
is
described
if
not
on
his
bosom
as
seated
next
to
socrates
who
is
playing
with
his
hair
he
too
like
apollodorus
takes
no
part
in
the
discussion
but
he
loves
above
all
things
to
hear
and
speak
of
socrates
after
his
death
the
calmness
of
his
behaviour
veiling
his
face
when
he
can
no
longer
restrain
his
tears
contrasts
with
the
passionate
outcries
of
the
other
at
a
particular
point
the
argument
is
described
as
falling
before
the
attack
of
simmias
a
sort
of
despair
is
introduced
in
the
minds
of
the
company
the
effect
of
this
is
heightened
by
the
description
of
phaedo
who
has
been
the
of
the
scene
and
by
the
sympathy
of
his
phliasian
auditors
who
are
beginning
to
think
they
too
can
never
trust
an
argument
again
and
the
intense
interest
of
the
company
is
communicated
not
only
to
the
first
auditors
but
to
us
who
in
a
distant
country
read
the
narrative
of
their
emotions
after
more
than
two
thousand
years
have
passed
away
the
two
principal
interlocutors
are
simmias
and
cebes
the
disciples
of
philolaus
the
pythagorean
philosopher
of
thebes
simmias
is
described
in
the
phaedrus
as
fonder
of
an
argument
than
any
man
living
and
cebes
although
finally
persuaded
by
socrates
is
said
to
be
the
most
incredulous
of
human
beings
it
is
cebes
who
at
the
commencement
of
the
dialogue
asks
why
is
held
to
be
unlawful
and
who
first
supplies
the
doctrine
of
recollection
in
confirmation
of
the
of
the
soul
it
is
cebes
who
urges
that
the
does
not
necessarily
involve
the
future
existence
of
the
soul
as
is
shown
by
the
illustration
of
the
weaver
and
his
coat
simmias
on
the
other
hand
raises
the
question
about
harmony
and
the
lyre
which
is
naturally
put
into
the
mouth
of
a
pythagorean
disciple
it
is
simmias
too
who
first
remarks
on
the
uncertainty
of
human
knowledge
and
only
at
last
concedes
to
the
argument
such
a
qualified
approval
as
is
consistent
with
the
feebleness
of
the
human
faculties
cebes
is
the
deeper
and
more
consecutive
thinker
simmias
more
superficial
and
rhetorical
they
are
distinguished
in
much
the
same
manner
as
adeimantus
and
glaucon
in
the
republic
other
persons
menexenus
ctesippus
lysis
are
old
friends
evenus
has
been
already
satirized
in
the
apology
aeschines
and
epigenes
were
present
at
the
trial
euclid
and
terpsion
will
reappear
in
the
introduction
to
the
theaetetus
hermogenes
has
already
appeared
in
the
cratylus
no
inference
can
fairly
be
drawn
from
the
absence
of
aristippus
nor
from
the
omission
of
xenophon
who
at
the
time
of
socrates
death
was
in
asia
the
mention
of
plato
own
absence
seems
like
an
expression
of
sorrow
and
may
perhaps
be
an
indication
that
the
report
of
the
conversation
is
not
to
be
taken
literally
the
place
of
the
dialogue
in
the
series
is
doubtful
the
doctrine
of
ideas
is
certainly
carried
beyond
the
socratic
point
of
view
in
no
other
of
the
writings
of
plato
is
the
theory
of
them
so
completely
developed
whether
the
belief
in
immortality
can
be
attributed
to
socrates
or
not
is
uncertain
the
silence
of
the
memorabilia
and
of
the
earlier
dialogues
of
plato
is
an
argument
to
the
contrary
yet
in
the
cyropaedia
xenophon
has
put
language
into
the
mouth
of
the
dying
cyrus
which
recalls
the
phaedo
and
may
have
been
derived
from
the
teaching
of
socrates
it
may
be
fairly
urged
that
the
greatest
religious
interest
of
mankind
could
not
have
been
wholly
ignored
by
one
who
passed
his
life
in
fulfilling
the
commands
of
an
oracle
and
who
recognized
a
divine
plan
in
man
and
nature
xen
mem
and
the
language
of
the
apology
and
of
the
crito
confirms
this
view
the
phaedo
is
not
one
of
the
socratic
dialogues
of
plato
nor
on
the
other
hand
can
it
be
assigned
to
that
later
stage
of
the
platonic
writings
at
which
the
doctrine
of
ideas
appears
to
be
forgotten
it
belongs
rather
to
the
intermediate
period
of
the
platonic
philosophy
which
roughly
corresponds
to
the
phaedrus
gorgias
republic
theaetetus
without
pretending
to
determine
the
real
time
of
their
composition
the
symposium
meno
euthyphro
apology
phaedo
may
be
conveniently
read
by
us
in
this
order
as
illustrative
of
the
life
of
socrates
another
chain
may
be
formed
of
the
meno
phaedrus
phaedo
in
which
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
connected
with
the
doctrine
of
ideas
in
the
meno
the
theory
of
ideas
is
based
on
the
ancient
belief
in
transmigration
which
reappears
again
in
the
phaedrus
as
well
as
in
the
republic
and
timaeus
and
in
all
of
them
is
connected
with
a
doctrine
of
retribution
in
the
phaedrus
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
supposed
to
rest
on
the
conception
of
the
soul
as
a
principle
of
motion
whereas
in
the
republic
the
argument
turns
on
the
natural
continuance
of
the
soul
which
if
not
destroyed
by
her
own
proper
evil
can
hardly
be
destroyed
by
any
other
the
soul
of
man
in
the
timaeus
is
derived
from
the
supreme
creator
and
either
returns
after
death
to
her
kindred
star
or
descends
into
the
lower
life
of
an
animal
the
apology
expresses
the
same
view
as
the
phaedo
but
with
less
confidence
there
the
probability
of
death
being
a
long
sleep
is
not
excluded
the
theaetetus
also
describes
in
a
digression
the
desire
of
the
soul
to
fly
away
and
be
with
god
to
fly
to
him
is
to
be
like
him
the
symposium
may
be
observed
to
resemble
as
well
as
to
differ
from
the
phaedo
while
the
first
notion
of
immortality
is
only
in
the
way
of
natural
procreation
or
of
posthumous
fame
and
glory
the
higher
revelation
of
beauty
like
the
good
in
the
republic
is
the
vision
of
the
eternal
idea
so
deeply
rooted
in
plato
mind
is
the
belief
in
immortality
so
various
are
the
forms
of
expression
which
he
employs
as
in
several
other
dialogues
there
is
more
of
system
in
the
phaedo
than
appears
at
first
sight
the
succession
of
arguments
is
based
on
previous
philosophies
beginning
with
the
mysteries
and
the
heracleitean
alternation
of
opposites
and
proceeding
to
the
pythagorean
harmony
and
transmigration
making
a
step
by
the
aid
of
platonic
reminiscence
and
a
further
step
by
the
help
of
the
nous
of
anaxagoras
until
at
last
we
rest
in
the
conviction
that
the
soul
is
inseparable
from
the
ideas
and
belongs
to
the
world
of
the
invisible
and
unknown
then
as
in
the
gorgias
or
republic
the
curtain
falls
and
the
veil
of
mythology
descends
upon
the
argument
after
the
confession
of
socrates
that
he
is
an
interested
party
and
the
acknowledgment
that
no
man
of
sense
will
think
the
details
of
his
narrative
true
but
that
something
of
the
kind
is
true
we
return
from
speculation
to
practice
he
is
himself
more
confident
of
immortality
than
he
is
of
his
own
arguments
and
the
confidence
which
he
expresses
is
less
strong
than
that
which
his
cheerfulness
and
composure
in
death
inspire
in
us
difficulties
of
two
kinds
occur
in
the
phaedo
one
kind
to
be
explained
out
of
contemporary
philosophy
the
other
not
admitting
of
an
entire
solution
the
difficulty
which
socrates
says
that
he
experienced
in
explaining
generation
and
corruption
the
assumption
of
hypotheses
which
proceed
from
the
less
general
to
the
more
general
and
are
tested
by
their
consequences
the
puzzle
about
greater
and
less
the
resort
to
the
method
of
ideas
which
to
us
appear
only
abstract
terms
these
are
to
be
explained
out
of
the
position
of
socrates
and
plato
in
the
history
of
philosophy
they
were
living
in
a
twilight
between
the
sensible
and
the
intellectual
world
and
saw
no
way
of
connecting
them
they
could
neither
explain
the
relation
of
ideas
to
phenomena
nor
their
correlation
to
one
another
the
very
idea
of
relation
or
comparison
was
embarrassing
to
them
yet
in
this
intellectual
uncertainty
they
had
a
conception
of
a
proof
from
results
and
of
a
moral
truth
which
remained
unshaken
amid
the
questionings
of
philosophy
the
other
is
a
difficulty
which
is
touched
upon
in
the
republic
as
well
as
in
the
phaedo
and
is
common
to
modern
and
ancient
philosophy
plato
is
not
altogether
satisfied
with
his
safe
and
simple
method
of
ideas
he
wants
to
have
proved
to
him
by
facts
that
all
things
are
for
the
best
and
that
there
is
one
mind
or
design
which
pervades
them
all
but
this
of
the
best
he
is
unable
to
explain
and
therefore
takes
refuge
in
universal
ideas
and
are
not
we
at
this
day
seeking
to
discover
that
which
socrates
in
a
glass
darkly
foresaw
some
resemblances
to
the
greek
drama
may
be
noted
in
all
the
dialogues
of
plato
the
phaedo
is
the
tragedy
of
which
socrates
is
the
protagonist
and
simmias
and
cebes
the
secondary
performers
standing
to
them
in
the
same
relation
as
to
glaucon
and
adeimantus
in
the
republic
no
dialogue
has
a
greater
unity
of
subject
and
feeling
plato
has
certainly
fulfilled
the
condition
of
greek
or
rather
of
all
art
which
requires
that
scenes
of
death
and
suffering
should
be
clothed
in
beauty
the
gathering
of
the
friends
at
the
commencement
of
the
dialogue
the
dismissal
of
xanthippe
whose
presence
would
have
been
out
of
place
at
a
philosophical
discussion
but
who
returns
again
with
her
children
to
take
a
final
farewell
the
dejection
of
the
audience
at
the
temporary
overthrow
of
the
argument
the
picture
of
socrates
playing
with
the
hair
of
phaedo
the
final
scene
in
which
socrates
alone
retains
his
composure
are
masterpieces
of
art
and
the
chorus
at
the
end
might
have
interpreted
the
feeling
of
the
play
can
no
evil
happen
to
a
good
man
in
life
or
death
art
of
concealing
art
is
nowhere
more
perfect
than
in
those
writings
of
plato
which
describe
the
trial
and
death
of
socrates
their
charm
is
their
simplicity
which
gives
them
verisimilitude
and
yet
they
touch
as
if
incidentally
and
because
they
were
suitable
to
the
occasion
on
some
of
the
deepest
truths
of
philosophy
there
is
nothing
in
any
tragedy
ancient
or
modern
nothing
in
poetry
or
history
with
one
exception
like
the
last
hours
of
socrates
in
plato
the
master
could
not
be
more
fitly
occupied
at
such
a
time
than
in
discoursing
of
immortality
nor
the
disciples
more
divinely
consoled
the
arguments
taken
in
the
spirit
and
not
in
the
letter
are
our
arguments
and
socrates
by
anticipation
may
be
even
thought
to
refute
some
notions
current
in
our
own
age
for
there
are
philosophers
among
ourselves
who
do
not
seem
to
understand
how
much
stronger
is
the
power
of
intelligence
or
of
the
best
than
of
atlas
or
mechanical
force
how
far
the
words
attributed
to
socrates
were
actually
uttered
by
him
we
forbear
to
ask
for
no
answer
can
be
given
to
this
question
and
it
is
better
to
resign
ourselves
to
the
feeling
of
a
great
work
than
to
linger
among
critical
uncertainties
phaedo
persons
of
the
dialogue
phaedo
who
is
the
narrator
of
the
dialogue
to
echecrates
of
phlius
socrates
apollodorus
simmias
cebes
crito
and
an
attendant
of

prison
scene
the
prison

place

phlius
echecrates
were
you
yourself
phaedo
in
the
prison
with
socrates
on
the
day
when
he
drank
the
poison
phaedo
yes
echecrates
i
was
echecrates
i
should
so
like
to
hear
about
his
death
what
did
he
say
in
his
last
hours
we
were
informed
that
he
died
by
taking
poison
but
no
one
knew
anything
more
for
no
phliasian
ever
goes
to
athens
now
and
it
is
a
long
time
since
any
stranger
from
athens
has
found
his
way
hither
so
that
we
had
no
clear
account
phaedo
did
you
not
hear
of
the
proceedings
at
the
trial
echecrates
yes
some
one
told
us
about
the
trial
and
we
could
not
understand
why
having
been
condemned
he
should
have
been
put
to
death
not
at
the
time
but
long
afterwards
what
was
the
reason
of
this
phaedo
an
accident
echecrates
the
stern
of
the
ship
which
the
athenians
send
to
delos
happened
to
have
been
crowned
on
the
day
before
he
was
tried
echecrates
what
is
this
ship
phaedo
it
is
the
ship
in
which
according
to
athenian
tradition
theseus
went
to
crete
when
he
took
with
him
the
fourteen
youths
and
was
the
saviour
of
them
and
of
himself
and
they
were
said
to
have
vowed
to
apollo
at
the
time
that
if
they
were
saved
they
would
send
a
yearly
mission
to
delos
now
this
custom
still
continues
and
the
whole
period
of
the
voyage
to
and
from
delos
beginning
when
the
priest
of
apollo
crowns
the
stern
of
the
ship
is
a
holy
season
during
which
the
city
is
not
allowed
to
be
polluted
by
public
executions
and
when
the
vessel
is
detained
by
contrary
winds
the
time
spent
in
going
and
returning
is
very
considerable
as
i
was
saying
the
ship
was
crowned
on
the
day
before
the
trial
and
this
was
the
reason
why
socrates
lay
in
prison
and
was
not
put
to
death
until
long
after
he
was
condemned
echecrates
what
was
the
manner
of
his
death
phaedo
what
was
said
or
done
and
which
of
his
friends
were
with
him
or
did
the
authorities
forbid
them
to
be
present
so
that
he
had
no
friends
near
him
when
he
died
phaedo
no
there
were
several
of
them
with
him
echecrates
if
you
have
nothing
to
do
i
wish
that
you
would
tell
me
what
passed
as
exactly
as
you
can
phaedo
i
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
and
will
try
to
gratify
your
wish
to
be
reminded
of
socrates
is
always
the
greatest
delight
to
me
whether
i
speak
myself
or
hear
another
speak
of
him
echecrates
you
will
have
listeners
who
are
of
the
same
mind
with
you
and
i
hope
that
you
will
be
as
exact
as
you
can
phaedo
i
had
a
singular
feeling
at
being
in
his
company
for
i
could
hardly
believe
that
i
was
present
at
the
death
of
a
friend
and
therefore
i
did
not
pity
him
echecrates
he
died
so
fearlessly
and
his
words
and
bearing
were
so
noble
and
gracious
that
to
me
he
appeared
blessed
i
thought
that
in
going
to
the
other
world
he
could
not
be
without
a
divine
call
and
that
he
would
be
happy
if
any
man
ever
was
when
he
arrived
there
and
therefore
i
did
not
pity
him
as
might
have
seemed
natural
at
such
an
hour
but
i
had
not
the
pleasure
which
i
usually
feel
in
philosophical
discourse
for
philosophy
was
the
theme
of
which
we
spoke
i
was
pleased
but
in
the
pleasure
there
was
also
a
strange
admixture
of
pain
for
i
reflected
that
he
was
soon
to
die
and
this
double
feeling
was
shared
by
us
all
we
were
laughing
and
weeping
by
turns
especially
the
excitable
apollodorus
you
know
the
sort
of
man
echecrates
yes
phaedo
he
was
quite
beside
himself
and
i
and
all
of
us
were
greatly
moved
echecrates
who
were
present
phaedo
of
native
athenians
there
were
besides
apollodorus
critobulus
and
his
father
crito
hermogenes
epigenes
aeschines
antisthenes
likewise
ctesippus
of
the
deme
of
paeania
menexenus
and
some
others
plato
if
i
am
not
mistaken
was
echecrates
were
there
any
strangers
phaedo
yes
there
were
simmias
the
theban
and
cebes
and
phaedondes
euclid
and
terpison
who
came
from
megara
echecrates
and
was
aristippus
there
and
cleombrotus
phaedo
no
they
were
said
to
be
in
aegina
echecrates
any
one
else
phaedo
i
think
that
these
were
nearly
all
echecrates
well
and
what
did
you
talk
about
phaedo
i
will
begin
at
the
beginning
and
endeavour
to
repeat
the
entire
conversation
on
the
previous
days
we
had
been
in
the
habit
of
assembling
early
in
the
morning
at
the
court
in
which
the
trial
took
place
and
which
is
not
far
from
the
prison
there
we
used
to
wait
talking
with
one
another
until
the
opening
of
the
doors
for
they
were
not
opened
very
early
then
we
went
in
and
generally
passed
the
day
with
socrates
on
the
last
morning
we
assembled
sooner
than
usual
having
heard
on
the
day
before
when
we
quitted
the
prison
in
the
evening
that
the
sacred
ship
had
come
from
delos
and
so
we
arranged
to
meet
very
early
at
the
accustomed
place
on
our
arrival
the
jailer
who
answered
the
door
instead
of
admitting
us
came
out
and
told
us
to
stay
until
he
called
us
the
eleven
he
said
now
with
socrates
they
are
taking
off
his
chains
and
giving
orders
that
he
is
to
die
he
soon
returned
and
said
that
we
might
come
in
on
entering
we
found
socrates
just
released
from
chains
and
xanthippe
whom
you
know
sitting
by
him
and
holding
his
child
in
her
arms
when
she
saw
us
she
uttered
a
cry
and
said
as
women
will
socrates
this
is
the
last
time
that
either
you
will
converse
with
your
friends
or
they
with
you
socrates
turned
to
crito
and
said
let
some
one
take
her
home
some
of
crito
people
accordingly
led
her
away
crying
out
and
beating
herself
and
when
she
was
gone
socrates
sitting
up
on
the
couch
bent
and
rubbed
his
leg
saying
as
he
was
rubbing
how
singular
is
the
thing
called
pleasure
and
how
curiously
related
to
pain
which
might
be
thought
to
be
the
opposite
of
it
for
they
are
never
present
to
a
man
at
the
same
instant
and
yet
he
who
pursues
either
is
generally
compelled
to
take
the
other
their
bodies
are
two
but
they
are
joined
by
a
single
head
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
if
aesop
had
remembered
them
he
would
have
made
a
fable
about
god
trying
to
reconcile
their
strife
and
how
when
he
could
not
he
fastened
their
heads
together
and
this
is
the
reason
why
when
one
comes
the
other
follows
as
i
know
by
my
own
experience
now
when
after
the
pain
in
my
leg
which
was
caused
by
the
chain
pleasure
appears
to
succeed
upon
this
cebes
said
i
am
glad
socrates
that
you
have
mentioned
the
name
of
aesop
for
it
reminds
me
of
a
question
which
has
been
asked
by
many
and
was
asked
of
me
only
the
day
before
yesterday
by
evenus
the
poet
he
will
be
sure
to
ask
it
again
and
therefore
if
you
would
like
me
to
have
an
answer
ready
for
him
you
may
as
well
tell
me
what
i
should
say
to
him
he
wanted
to
know
why
you
who
never
before
wrote
a
line
of
poetry
now
that
you
are
in
prison
are
turning
aesop
fables
into
verse
and
also
composing
that
hymn
in
honour
of
apollo
tell
him
cebes
he
replied
what
is
the
truth
that
i
had
no
idea
of
rivalling
him
or
his
poems
to
do
so
as
i
knew
would
be
no
easy
task
but
i
wanted
to
see
whether
i
could
purge
away
a
scruple
which
i
felt
about
the
meaning
of
certain
dreams
in
the
course
of
my
life
i
have
often
had
intimations
in
dreams
i
should
compose
music
the
same
dream
came
to
me
sometimes
in
one
form
and
sometimes
in
another
but
always
saying
the
same
or
nearly
the
same
words
and
make
music
said
the
dream
and
hitherto
i
had
imagined
that
this
was
only
intended
to
exhort
and
encourage
me
in
the
study
of
philosophy
which
has
been
the
pursuit
of
my
life
and
is
the
noblest
and
best
of
music
the
dream
was
bidding
me
do
what
i
was
already
doing
in
the
same
way
that
the
competitor
in
a
race
is
bidden
by
the
spectators
to
run
when
he
is
already
running
but
i
was
not
certain
of
this
for
the
dream
might
have
meant
music
in
the
popular
sense
of
the
word
and
being
under
sentence
of
death
and
the
festival
giving
me
a
respite
i
thought
that
it
would
be
safer
for
me
to
satisfy
the
scruple
and
in
obedience
to
the
dream
to
compose
a
few
verses
before
i
departed
and
first
i
made
a
hymn
in
honour
of
the
god
of
the
festival
and
then
considering
that
a
poet
if
he
is
really
to
be
a
poet
should
not
only
put
together
words
but
should
invent
stories
and
that
i
have
no
invention
i
took
some
fables
of
aesop
which
i
had
ready
at
hand
and
which
i
knew
they
were
the
first
i
came
upon
and
turned
them
into
verse
tell
this
to
evenus
cebes
and
bid
him
be
of
good
cheer
say
that
i
would
have
him
come
after
me
if
he
be
a
wise
man
and
not
tarry
and
that
i
am
likely
to
be
going
for
the
athenians
say
that
i
must
simmias
said
what
a
message
for
such
a
man
having
been
a
frequent
companion
of
his
i
should
say
that
as
far
as
i
know
him
he
will
never
take
your
advice
unless
he
is
obliged
why
said
socrates
is
not
evenus
a
philosopher
i
think
that
he
is
said
simmias
then
he
or
any
man
who
has
the
spirit
of
philosophy
will
be
willing
to
die
but
he
will
not
take
his
own
life
for
that
is
held
to
be
unlawful
here
he
changed
his
position
and
put
his
legs
off
the
couch
on
to
the
ground
and
during
the
rest
of
the
conversation
he
remained
sitting
why
do
you
say
enquired
cebes
that
a
man
ought
not
to
take
his
own
life
but
that
the
philosopher
will
be
ready
to
follow
the
dying
socrates
replied
and
have
you
cebes
and
simmias
who
are
the
disciples
of
philolaus
never
heard
him
speak
of
this
yes
but
his
language
was
obscure
socrates
my
words
too
are
only
an
echo
but
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
repeat
what
i
have
heard
and
indeed
as
i
am
going
to
another
place
it
is
very
meet
for
me
to
be
thinking
and
talking
of
the
nature
of
the
pilgrimage
which
i
am
about
to
make
what
can
i
do
better
in
the
interval
between
this
and
the
setting
of
the
sun
then
tell
me
socrates
why
is
suicide
held
to
be
unlawful
as
i
have
certainly
heard
philolaus
about
whom
you
were
just
now
asking
affirm
when
he
was
staying
with
us
at
thebes
and
there
are
others
who
say
the
same
although
i
have
never
understood
what
was
meant
by
any
of
them
do
not
lose
heart
replied
socrates
and
the
day
may
come
when
you
will
understand
i
suppose
that
you
wonder
why
when
other
things
which
are
evil
may
be
good
at
certain
times
and
to
certain
persons
death
is
to
be
the
only
exception
and
why
when
a
man
is
better
dead
he
is
not
permitted
to
be
his
own
benefactor
but
must
wait
for
the
hand
of
another
very
true
said
cebes
laughing
gently
and
speaking
in
his
native
boeotian
i
admit
the
appearance
of
inconsistency
in
what
i
am
saying
but
there
may
not
be
any
real
inconsistency
after
all
there
is
a
doctrine
whispered
in
secret
that
man
is
a
prisoner
who
has
no
right
to
open
the
door
and
run
away
this
is
a
great
mystery
which
i
do
not
quite
understand
yet
i
too
believe
that
the
gods
are
our
guardians
and
that
we
are
a
possession
of
theirs
do
you
not
agree
yes
i
quite
agree
said
cebes
and
if
one
of
your
own
possessions
an
ox
or
an
ass
for
example
took
the
liberty
of
putting
himself
out
of
the
way
when
you
had
given
no
intimation
of
your
wish
that
he
should
die
would
you
not
be
angry
with
him
and
would
you
not
punish
him
if
you
could
certainly
replied
cebes
then
if
we
look
at
the
matter
thus
there
may
be
reason
in
saying
that
a
man
should
wait
and
not
take
his
own
life
until
god
summons
him
as
he
is
now
summoning
me
yes
socrates
said
cebes
there
seems
to
be
truth
in
what
you
say
and
yet
how
can
you
reconcile
this
seemingly
true
belief
that
god
is
our
guardian
and
we
his
possessions
with
the
willingness
to
die
which
we
were
just
now
attributing
to
the
philosopher
that
the
wisest
of
men
should
be
willing
to
leave
a
service
in
which
they
are
ruled
by
the
gods
who
are
the
best
of
rulers
is
not
reasonable
for
surely
no
wise
man
thinks
that
when
set
at
liberty
he
can
take
better
care
of
himself
than
the
gods
take
of
him
a
fool
may
perhaps
think
so
he
may
argue
that
he
had
better
run
away
from
his
master
not
considering
that
his
duty
is
to
remain
to
the
end
and
not
to
run
away
from
the
good
and
that
there
would
be
no
sense
in
his
running
away
the
wise
man
will
want
to
be
ever
with
him
who
is
better
than
himself
now
this
socrates
is
the
reverse
of
what
was
just
now
said
for
upon
this
view
the
wise
man
should
sorrow
and
the
fool
rejoice
at
passing
out
of
life
the
earnestness
of
cebes
seemed
to
please
socrates
here
said
he
turning
to
us
is
a
man
who
is
always
inquiring
and
is
not
so
easily
convinced
by
the
first
thing
which
he
hears
and
certainly
added
simmias
the
objection
which
he
is
now
making
does
appear
to
me
to
have
some
force
for
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
a
truly
wise
man
wanting
to
fly
away
and
lightly
leave
a
master
who
is
better
than
himself
and
i
rather
imagine
that
cebes
is
referring
to
you
he
thinks
that
you
are
too
ready
to
leave
us
and
too
ready
to
leave
the
gods
whom
you
acknowledge
to
be
our
good
masters
yes
replied
socrates
there
is
reason
in
what
you
say
and
so
you
think
that
i
ought
to
answer
your
indictment
as
if
i
were
in
a
court
we
should
like
you
to
do
so
said
simmias
then
i
must
try
to
make
a
more
successful
defence
before
you
than
i
did
when
before
the
judges
for
i
am
quite
ready
to
admit
simmias
and
cebes
that
i
ought
to
be
grieved
at
death
if
i
were
not
persuaded
in
the
first
place
that
i
am
going
to
other
gods
who
are
wise
and
good
of
which
i
am
as
certain
as
i
can
be
of
any
such
matters
and
secondly
though
i
am
not
so
sure
of
this
last
to
men
departed
better
than
those
whom
i
leave
behind
and
therefore
i
do
not
grieve
as
i
might
have
done
for
i
have
good
hope
that
there
is
yet
something
remaining
for
the
dead
and
as
has
been
said
of
old
some
far
better
thing
for
the
good
than
for
the
evil
but
do
you
mean
to
take
away
your
thoughts
with
you
socrates
said
simmias
will
you
not
impart
them
to
us
for
they
are
a
benefit
in
which
we
too
are
entitled
to
share
moreover
if
you
succeed
in
convincing
us
that
will
be
an
answer
to
the
charge
against
yourself
i
will
do
my
best
replied
socrates
but
you
must
first
let
me
hear
what
crito
wants
he
has
long
been
wishing
to
say
something
to
me
only
this
socrates
replied
crito
the
attendant
who
is
to
give
you
the
poison
has
been
telling
me
and
he
wants
me
to
tell
you
that
you
are
not
to
talk
much
talking
he
says
increases
heat
and
this
is
apt
to
interfere
with
the
action
of
the
poison
persons
who
excite
themselves
are
sometimes
obliged
to
take
a
second
or
even
a
third
dose
then
said
socrates
let
him
mind
his
business
and
be
prepared
to
give
the
poison
twice
or
even
thrice
if
necessary
that
is
all
i
knew
quite
well
what
you
would
say
replied
crito
but
i
was
obliged
to
satisfy
him
never
mind
him
he
said
and
now
o
my
judges
i
desire
to
prove
to
you
that
the
real
philosopher
has
reason
to
be
of
good
cheer
when
he
is
about
to
die
and
that
after
death
he
may
hope
to
obtain
the
greatest
good
in
the
other
world
and
how
this
may
be
simmias
and
cebes
i
will
endeavour
to
explain
for
i
deem
that
the
true
votary
of
philosophy
is
likely
to
be
misunderstood
by
other
men
they
do
not
perceive
that
he
is
always
pursuing
death
and
dying
and
if
this
be
so
and
he
has
had
the
desire
of
death
all
his
life
long
why
when
his
time
comes
should
he
repine
at
that
which
he
has
been
always
pursuing
and
desiring
simmias
said
laughingly
though
not
in
a
laughing
humour
you
have
made
me
laugh
socrates
for
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
many
when
they
hear
your
words
will
say
how
truly
you
have
described
philosophers
and
our
people
at
home
will
likewise
say
that
the
life
which
philosophers
desire
is
in
reality
death
and
that
they
have
found
them
out
to
be
deserving
of
the
death
which
they
desire
and
they
are
right
simmias
in
thinking
so
with
the
exception
of
the
words
have
found
them
out
for
they
have
not
found
out
either
what
is
the
nature
of
that
death
which
the
true
philosopher
deserves
or
how
he
deserves
or
desires
death
but
enough
of
them
let
us
discuss
the
matter
among
ourselves
do
we
believe
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
death
to
be
sure
replied
simmias
is
it
not
the
separation
of
soul
and
body
and
to
be
dead
is
the
completion
of
this
when
the
soul
exists
in
herself
and
is
released
from
the
body
and
the
body
is
released
from
the
soul
what
is
this
but
death
just
so
he
replied
there
is
another
question
which
will
probably
throw
light
on
our
present
inquiry
if
you
and
i
can
agree
about
it
ought
the
philosopher
to
care
about
the
pleasures
if
they
are
to
be
called
pleasures
of
eating
and
drinking
certainly
not
answered
simmias
and
what
about
the
pleasures
of
love
should
he
care
for
them
by
no
means
and
will
he
think
much
of
the
other
ways
of
indulging
the
body
for
example
the
acquisition
of
costly
raiment
or
sandals
or
other
adornments
of
the
body
instead
of
caring
about
them
does
he
not
rather
despise
anything
more
than
nature
needs
what
do
you
say
i
should
say
that
the
true
philosopher
would
despise
them
would
you
not
say
that
he
is
entirely
concerned
with
the
soul
and
not
with
the
body
he
would
like
as
far
as
he
can
to
get
away
from
the
body
and
to
turn
to
the
soul
quite
true
in
matters
of
this
sort
philosophers
above
all
other
men
may
be
observed
in
every
sort
of
way
to
dissever
the
soul
from
the
communion
of
the
body
very
true
whereas
simmias
the
rest
of
the
world
are
of
opinion
that
to
him
who
has
no
sense
of
pleasure
and
no
part
in
bodily
pleasure
life
is
not
worth
having
and
that
he
who
is
indifferent
about
them
is
as
good
as
dead
that
is
also
true
what
again
shall
we
say
of
the
actual
acquirement
of
knowledge
is
the
body
if
invited
to
share
in
the
enquiry
a
hinderer
or
a
helper
i
mean
to
say
have
sight
and
hearing
any
truth
in
them
are
they
not
as
the
poets
are
always
telling
us
inaccurate
witnesses
and
yet
if
even
they
are
inaccurate
and
indistinct
what
is
to
be
said
of
the
other
senses
for
you
will
allow
that
they
are
the
best
of
them
certainly
he
replied
then
when
does
the
soul
attain
truth
for
in
attempting
to
consider
anything
in
company
with
the
body
she
is
obviously
deceived
true
then
must
not
true
existence
be
revealed
to
her
in
thought
if
at
all
yes
and
thought
is
best
when
the
mind
is
gathered
into
herself
and
none
of
these
things
trouble
her
neither
sounds
nor
sights
nor
pain
nor
any
pleasure
when
she
takes
leave
of
the
body
and
has
as
little
as
possible
to
do
with
it
when
she
has
no
bodily
sense
or
desire
but
is
aspiring
after
true
being
certainly
and
in
this
the
philosopher
dishonours
the
body
his
soul
runs
away
from
his
body
and
desires
to
be
alone
and
by
herself
that
is
true
well
but
there
is
another
thing
simmias
is
there
or
is
there
not
an
absolute
justice
assuredly
there
is
and
an
absolute
beauty
and
absolute
good
of
course
but
did
you
ever
behold
any
of
them
with
your
eyes
certainly
not
or
did
you
ever
reach
them
with
any
other
bodily
sense
and
i
speak
not
of
these
alone
but
of
absolute
greatness
and
health
and
strength
and
of
the
essence
or
true
nature
of
everything
has
the
reality
of
them
ever
been
perceived
by
you
through
the
bodily
organs
or
rather
is
not
the
nearest
approach
to
the
knowledge
of
their
several
natures
made
by
him
who
so
orders
his
intellectual
vision
as
to
have
the
most
exact
conception
of
the
essence
of
each
thing
which
he
considers
certainly
and
he
attains
to
the
purest
knowledge
of
them
who
goes
to
each
with
the
mind
alone
not
introducing
or
intruding
in
the
act
of
thought
sight
or
any
other
sense
together
with
reason
but
with
the
very
light
of
the
mind
in
her
own
clearness
searches
into
the
very
truth
of
each
he
who
has
got
rid
as
far
as
he
can
of
eyes
and
ears
and
so
to
speak
of
the
whole
body
these
being
in
his
opinion
distracting
elements
which
when
they
infect
the
soul
hinder
her
from
acquiring
truth
and
knowledge
who
if
not
he
is
likely
to
attain
the
knowledge
of
true
being
what
you
say
has
a
wonderful
truth
in
it
socrates
replied
simmias
and
when
real
philosophers
consider
all
these
things
will
they
not
be
led
to
make
a
reflection
which
they
will
express
in
words
something
like
the
following
we
not
found
they
will
say
path
of
thought
which
seems
to
bring
us
and
our
argument
to
the
conclusion
that
while
we
are
in
the
body
and
while
the
soul
is
infected
with
the
evils
of
the
body
our
desire
will
not
be
satisfied
and
our
desire
is
of
the
truth
for
the
body
is
a
source
of
endless
trouble
to
us
by
reason
of
the
mere
requirement
of
food
and
is
liable
also
to
diseases
which
overtake
and
impede
us
in
the
search
after
true
being
it
fills
us
full
of
loves
and
lusts
and
fears
and
fancies
of
all
kinds
and
endless
foolery
and
in
fact
as
men
say
takes
away
from
us
the
power
of
thinking
at
all
whence
come
wars
and
fightings
and
factions
whence
but
from
the
body
and
the
lusts
of
the
body
wars
are
occasioned
by
the
love
of
money
and
money
has
to
be
acquired
for
the
sake
and
in
the
service
of
the
body
and
by
reason
of
all
these
impediments
we
have
no
time
to
give
to
philosophy
and
last
and
worst
of
all
even
if
we
are
at
leisure
and
betake
ourselves
to
some
speculation
the
body
is
always
breaking
in
upon
us
causing
turmoil
and
confusion
in
our
enquiries
and
so
amazing
us
that
we
are
prevented
from
seeing
the
truth
it
has
been
proved
to
us
by
experience
that
if
we
would
have
pure
knowledge
of
anything
we
must
be
quit
of
the
body
the
soul
in
herself
must
behold
things
in
themselves
and
then
we
shall
attain
the
wisdom
which
we
desire
and
of
which
we
say
that
we
are
lovers
not
while
we
live
but
after
death
for
if
while
in
company
with
the
body
the
soul
can
not
have
pure
knowledge
one
of
two
things
follows
either
knowledge
is
not
to
be
attained
at
all
or
if
at
all
after
death
for
then
and
not
till
then
the
soul
will
be
parted
from
the
body
and
exist
in
herself
alone
in
this
present
life
i
reckon
that
we
make
the
nearest
approach
to
knowledge
when
we
have
the
least
possible
intercourse
or
communion
with
the
body
and
are
not
surfeited
with
the
bodily
nature
but
keep
ourselves
pure
until
the
hour
when
god
himself
is
pleased
to
release
us
and
thus
having
got
rid
of
the
foolishness
of
the
body
we
shall
be
pure
and
hold
converse
with
the
pure
and
know
of
ourselves
the
clear
light
everywhere
which
is
no
other
than
the
light
of
truth
for
the
impure
are
not
permitted
to
approach
the
pure
these
are
the
sort
of
words
simmias
which
the
true
lovers
of
knowledge
can
not
help
saying
to
one
another
and
thinking
you
would
agree
would
you
not
undoubtedly
socrates
but
o
my
friend
if
this
is
true
there
is
great
reason
to
hope
that
going
whither
i
go
when
i
have
come
to
the
end
of
my
journey
i
shall
attain
that
which
has
been
the
pursuit
of
my
life
and
therefore
i
go
on
my
way
rejoicing
and
not
i
only
but
every
other
man
who
believes
that
his
mind
has
been
made
ready
and
that
he
is
in
a
manner
purified
certainly
replied
simmias
and
what
is
purification
but
the
separation
of
the
soul
from
the
body
as
i
was
saying
before
the
habit
of
the
soul
gathering
and
collecting
herself
into
herself
from
all
sides
out
of
the
body
the
dwelling
in
her
own
place
alone
as
in
another
life
so
also
in
this
as
far
as
she
can
the
release
of
the
soul
from
the
chains
of
the
body
very
true
he
said
and
this
separation
and
release
of
the
soul
from
the
body
is
termed
death
to
be
sure
he
said
and
the
true
philosophers
and
they
only
are
ever
seeking
to
release
the
soul
is
not
the
separation
and
release
of
the
soul
from
the
body
their
especial
study
that
is
true
and
as
i
was
saying
at
first
there
would
be
a
ridiculous
contradiction
in
men
studying
to
live
as
nearly
as
they
can
in
a
state
of
death
and
yet
repining
when
it
comes
upon
them
clearly
and
the
true
philosophers
simmias
are
always
occupied
in
the
practice
of
dying
wherefore
also
to
them
least
of
all
men
is
death
terrible
look
at
the
matter
thus
if
they
have
been
in
every
way
the
enemies
of
the
body
and
are
wanting
to
be
alone
with
the
soul
when
this
desire
of
theirs
is
granted
how
inconsistent
would
they
be
if
they
trembled
and
repined
instead
of
rejoicing
at
their
departure
to
that
place
where
when
they
arrive
they
hope
to
gain
that
which
in
life
they
desired
and
this
was
wisdom
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
rid
of
the
company
of
their
enemy
many
a
man
has
been
willing
to
go
to
the
world
below
animated
by
the
hope
of
seeing
there
an
earthly
love
or
wife
or
son
and
conversing
with
them
and
will
he
who
is
a
true
lover
of
wisdom
and
is
strongly
persuaded
in
like
manner
that
only
in
the
world
below
he
can
worthily
enjoy
her
still
repine
at
death
will
he
not
depart
with
joy
surely
he
will
o
my
friend
if
he
be
a
true
philosopher
for
he
will
have
a
firm
conviction
that
there
and
there
only
he
can
find
wisdom
in
her
purity
and
if
this
be
true
he
would
be
very
absurd
as
i
was
saying
if
he
were
afraid
of
death
he
would
indeed
replied
simmias
and
when
you
see
a
man
who
is
repining
at
the
approach
of
death
is
not
his
reluctance
a
sufficient
proof
that
he
is
not
a
lover
of
wisdom
but
a
lover
of
the
body
and
probably
at
the
same
time
a
lover
of
either
money
or
power
or
both
quite
so
he
replied
and
is
not
courage
simmias
a
quality
which
is
specially
characteristic
of
the
philosopher
certainly
there
is
temperance
again
which
even
by
the
vulgar
is
supposed
to
consist
in
the
control
and
regulation
of
the
passions
and
in
the
sense
of
superiority
to
them
is
not
temperance
a
virtue
belonging
to
those
only
who
despise
the
body
and
who
pass
their
lives
in
philosophy
most
assuredly
for
the
courage
and
temperance
of
other
men
if
you
will
consider
them
are
really
a
contradiction
how
so
well
he
said
you
are
aware
that
death
is
regarded
by
men
in
general
as
a
great
evil
very
true
he
said
and
do
not
courageous
men
face
death
because
they
are
afraid
of
yet
greater
evils
that
is
quite
true
then
all
but
the
philosophers
are
courageous
only
from
fear
and
because
they
are
afraid
and
yet
that
a
man
should
be
courageous
from
fear
and
because
he
is
a
coward
is
surely
a
strange
thing
very
true
and
are
not
the
temperate
exactly
in
the
same
case
they
are
temperate
because
they
are
intemperate
which
might
seem
to
be
a
contradiction
but
is
nevertheless
the
sort
of
thing
which
happens
with
this
foolish
temperance
for
there
are
pleasures
which
they
are
afraid
of
losing
and
in
their
desire
to
keep
them
they
abstain
from
some
pleasures
because
they
are
overcome
by
others
and
although
to
be
conquered
by
pleasure
is
called
by
men
intemperance
to
them
the
conquest
of
pleasure
consists
in
being
conquered
by
pleasure
and
that
is
what
i
mean
by
saying
that
in
a
sense
they
are
made
temperate
through
intemperance
such
appears
to
be
the
case
yet
the
exchange
of
one
fear
or
pleasure
or
pain
for
another
fear
or
pleasure
or
pain
and
of
the
greater
for
the
less
as
if
they
were
coins
is
not
the
exchange
of
virtue
o
my
blessed
simmias
is
there
not
one
true
coin
for
which
all
things
ought
to
be
exchanged
and
that
is
wisdom
and
only
in
exchange
for
this
and
in
company
with
this
is
anything
truly
bought
or
sold
whether
courage
or
temperance
or
justice
and
is
not
all
true
virtue
the
companion
of
wisdom
no
matter
what
fears
or
pleasures
or
other
similar
goods
or
evils
may
or
may
not
attend
her
but
the
virtue
which
is
made
up
of
these
goods
when
they
are
severed
from
wisdom
and
exchanged
with
one
another
is
a
shadow
of
virtue
only
nor
is
there
any
freedom
or
health
or
truth
in
her
but
in
the
true
exchange
there
is
a
purging
away
of
all
these
things
and
temperance
and
justice
and
courage
and
wisdom
herself
are
the
purgation
of
them
the
founders
of
the
mysteries
would
appear
to
have
had
a
real
meaning
and
were
not
talking
nonsense
when
they
intimated
in
a
figure
long
ago
that
he
who
passes
unsanctified
and
uninitiated
into
the
world
below
will
lie
in
a
slough
but
that
he
who
arrives
there
after
initiation
and
purification
will
dwell
with
the
gods
for
as
they
say
in
the
mysteries
the
but
few
are
the
mystics
meaning
as
i
interpret
the
words
true
philosophers
in
the
number
of
whom
during
my
whole
life
i
have
been
seeking
according
to
my
ability
to
find
a
place
whether
i
have
sought
in
a
right
way
or
not
and
whether
i
have
succeeded
or
not
i
shall
truly
know
in
a
little
while
if
god
will
when
i
myself
arrive
in
the
other
world
such
is
my
belief
and
therefore
i
maintain
that
i
am
right
simmias
and
cebes
in
not
grieving
or
repining
at
parting
from
you
and
my
masters
in
this
world
for
i
believe
that
i
shall
equally
find
good
masters
and
friends
in
another
world
but
most
men
do
not
believe
this
saying
if
then
i
succeed
in
convincing
you
by
my
defence
better
than
i
did
the
athenian
judges
it
will
be
well
cebes
answered
i
agree
socrates
in
the
greater
part
of
what
you
say
but
in
what
concerns
the
soul
men
are
apt
to
be
incredulous
they
fear
that
when
she
has
left
the
body
her
place
may
be
nowhere
and
that
on
the
very
day
of
death
she
may
perish
and
come
to
an
end
immediately
on
her
release
from
the
body
issuing
forth
dispersed
like
smoke
or
air
and
in
her
flight
vanishing
away
into
nothingness
if
she
could
only
be
collected
into
herself
after
she
has
obtained
release
from
the
evils
of
which
you
are
speaking
there
would
be
good
reason
to
hope
socrates
that
what
you
say
is
true
but
surely
it
requires
a
great
deal
of
argument
and
many
proofs
to
show
that
when
the
man
is
dead
his
soul
yet
exists
and
has
any
force
or
intelligence
true
cebes
said
socrates
and
shall
i
suggest
that
we
converse
a
little
of
the
probabilities
of
these
things
i
am
sure
said
cebes
that
i
should
greatly
like
to
know
your
opinion
about
them
i
reckon
said
socrates
that
no
one
who
heard
me
now
not
even
if
he
were
one
of
my
old
enemies
the
comic
poets
could
accuse
me
of
idle
talking
about
matters
in
which
i
have
no
concern
if
you
please
then
we
will
proceed
with
the
inquiry
suppose
we
consider
the
question
whether
the
souls
of
men
after
death
are
or
are
not
in
the
world
below
there
comes
into
my
mind
an
ancient
doctrine
which
affirms
that
they
go
from
hence
into
the
other
world
and
returning
hither
are
born
again
from
the
dead
now
if
it
be
true
that
the
living
come
from
the
dead
then
our
souls
must
exist
in
the
other
world
for
if
not
how
could
they
have
been
born
again
and
this
would
be
conclusive
if
there
were
any
real
evidence
that
the
living
are
only
born
from
the
dead
but
if
this
is
not
so
then
other
arguments
will
have
to
be
adduced
very
true
replied
cebes
then
let
us
consider
the
whole
question
not
in
relation
to
man
only
but
in
relation
to
animals
generally
and
to
plants
and
to
everything
of
which
there
is
generation
and
the
proof
will
be
easier
are
not
all
things
which
have
opposites
generated
out
of
their
opposites
i
mean
such
things
as
good
and
evil
just
and
unjust
and
there
are
innumerable
other
opposites
which
are
generated
out
of
opposites
and
i
want
to
show
that
in
all
opposites
there
is
of
necessity
a
similar
alternation
i
mean
to
say
for
example
that
anything
which
becomes
greater
must
become
greater
after
being
less
true
and
that
which
becomes
less
must
have
been
once
greater
and
then
have
become
less
yes
and
the
weaker
is
generated
from
the
stronger
and
the
swifter
from
the
slower
very
true
and
the
worse
is
from
the
better
and
the
more
just
is
from
the
more
unjust
of
course
and
is
this
true
of
all
opposites
and
are
we
convinced
that
all
of
them
are
generated
out
of
opposites
yes
and
in
this
universal
opposition
of
all
things
are
there
not
also
two
intermediate
processes
which
are
ever
going
on
from
one
to
the
other
opposite
and
back
again
where
there
is
a
greater
and
a
less
there
is
also
an
intermediate
process
of
increase
and
diminution
and
that
which
grows
is
said
to
wax
and
that
which
decays
to
wane
yes
he
said
and
there
are
many
other
processes
such
as
division
and
composition
cooling
and
heating
which
equally
involve
a
passage
into
and
out
of
one
another
and
this
necessarily
holds
of
all
opposites
even
though
not
always
expressed
in
words
they
are
really
generated
out
of
one
another
and
there
is
a
passing
or
process
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
very
true
he
replied
well
and
is
there
not
an
opposite
of
life
as
sleep
is
the
opposite
of
waking
true
he
said
and
what
is
it
death
he
answered
and
these
if
they
are
opposites
are
generated
the
one
from
the
other
and
have
there
their
two
intermediate
processes
also
of
course
now
said
socrates
i
will
analyze
one
of
the
two
pairs
of
opposites
which
i
have
mentioned
to
you
and
also
its
intermediate
processes
and
you
shall
analyze
the
other
to
me
one
of
them
i
term
sleep
the
other
waking
the
state
of
sleep
is
opposed
to
the
state
of
waking
and
out
of
sleeping
waking
is
generated
and
out
of
waking
sleeping
and
the
process
of
generation
is
in
the
one
case
falling
asleep
and
in
the
other
waking
up
do
you
agree
i
entirely
agree
then
suppose
that
you
analyze
life
and
death
to
me
in
the
same
manner
is
not
death
opposed
to
life
yes
and
they
are
generated
one
from
the
other
yes
what
is
generated
from
the
living
the
dead
and
what
from
the
dead
i
can
only
say
in
answer
the
living
then
the
living
whether
things
or
persons
cebes
are
generated
from
the
dead
that
is
clear
he
replied
then
the
inference
is
that
our
souls
exist
in
the
world
below
that
is
true
and
one
of
the
two
processes
or
generations
is
visible
for
surely
the
act
of
dying
is
visible
surely
he
said
what
then
is
to
be
the
result
shall
we
exclude
the
opposite
process
and
shall
we
suppose
nature
to
walk
on
one
leg
only
must
we
not
rather
assign
to
death
some
corresponding
process
of
generation
certainly
he
replied
and
what
is
that
process
return
to
life
and
return
to
life
if
there
be
such
a
thing
is
the
birth
of
the
dead
into
the
world
of
the
living
quite
true
then
here
is
a
new
way
by
which
we
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
living
come
from
the
dead
just
as
the
dead
come
from
the
living
and
this
if
true
affords
a
most
certain
proof
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
exist
in
some
place
out
of
which
they
come
again
yes
socrates
he
said
the
conclusion
seems
to
flow
necessarily
out
of
our
previous
admissions
and
that
these
admissions
were
not
unfair
cebes
he
said
may
be
shown
i
think
as
follows
if
generation
were
in
a
straight
line
only
and
there
were
no
compensation
or
circle
in
nature
no
turn
or
return
of
elements
into
their
opposites
then
you
know
that
all
things
would
at
last
have
the
same
form
and
pass
into
the
same
state
and
there
would
be
no
more
generation
of
them
what
do
you
mean
he
said
a
simple
thing
enough
which
i
will
illustrate
by
the
case
of
sleep
he
replied
you
know
that
if
there
were
no
alternation
of
sleeping
and
waking
the
tale
of
the
sleeping
endymion
would
in
the
end
have
no
meaning
because
all
other
things
would
be
asleep
too
and
he
would
not
be
distinguishable
from
the
rest
or
if
there
were
composition
only
and
no
division
of
substances
then
the
chaos
of
anaxagoras
would
come
again
and
in
like
manner
my
dear
cebes
if
all
things
which
partook
of
life
were
to
die
and
after
they
were
dead
remained
in
the
form
of
death
and
did
not
come
to
life
again
all
would
at
last
die
and
nothing
would
be
alive
what
other
result
could
there
be
for
if
the
living
spring
from
any
other
things
and
they
too
die
must
not
all
things
at
last
be
swallowed
up
in
death
but
compare
republic
there
is
no
escape
socrates
said
cebes
and
to
me
your
argument
seems
to
be
absolutely
true
yes
he
said
cebes
it
is
and
must
be
so
in
my
opinion
and
we
have
not
been
deluded
in
making
these
admissions
but
i
am
confident
that
there
truly
is
such
a
thing
as
living
again
and
that
the
living
spring
from
the
dead
and
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
are
in
existence
and
that
the
good
souls
have
a
better
portion
than
the
evil
cebes
added
your
favorite
doctrine
socrates
that
knowledge
is
simply
recollection
if
true
also
necessarily
implies
a
previous
time
in
which
we
have
learned
that
which
we
now
recollect
but
this
would
be
impossible
unless
our
soul
had
been
in
some
place
before
existing
in
the
form
of
man
here
then
is
another
proof
of
the
soul
immortality
but
tell
me
cebes
said
simmias
interposing
what
arguments
are
urged
in
favour
of
this
doctrine
of
recollection
i
am
not
very
sure
at
the
moment
that
i
remember
them
one
excellent
proof
said
cebes
is
afforded
by
questions
if
you
put
a
question
to
a
person
in
a
right
way
he
will
give
a
true
answer
of
himself
but
how
could
he
do
this
unless
there
were
knowledge
and
right
reason
already
in
him
and
this
is
most
clearly
shown
when
he
is
taken
to
a
diagram
or
to
anything
of
that
sort
compare
meno
but
if
said
socrates
you
are
still
incredulous
simmias
i
would
ask
you
whether
you
may
not
agree
with
me
when
you
look
at
the
matter
in
another
way
i
mean
if
you
are
still
incredulous
as
to
whether
knowledge
is
recollection
incredulous
i
am
not
said
simmias
but
i
want
to
have
this
doctrine
of
recollection
brought
to
my
own
recollection
and
from
what
cebes
has
said
i
am
beginning
to
recollect
and
be
convinced
but
i
should
still
like
to
hear
what
you
were
going
to
say
this
is
what
i
would
say
he
replied
we
should
agree
if
i
am
not
mistaken
that
what
a
man
recollects
he
must
have
known
at
some
previous
time
very
true
and
what
is
the
nature
of
this
knowledge
or
recollection
i
mean
to
ask
whether
a
person
who
having
seen
or
heard
or
in
any
way
perceived
anything
knows
not
only
that
but
has
a
conception
of
something
else
which
is
the
subject
not
of
the
same
but
of
some
other
kind
of
knowledge
may
not
be
fairly
said
to
recollect
that
of
which
he
has
the
conception
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
what
i
may
illustrate
by
the
following
instance
the
knowledge
of
a
lyre
is
not
the
same
as
the
knowledge
of
a
man
true
and
yet
what
is
the
feeling
of
lovers
when
they
recognize
a
lyre
or
a
garment
or
anything
else
which
the
beloved
has
been
in
the
habit
of
using
do
not
they
from
knowing
the
lyre
form
in
the
mind
eye
an
image
of
the
youth
to
whom
the
lyre
belongs
and
this
is
recollection
in
like
manner
any
one
who
sees
simmias
may
remember
cebes
and
there
are
endless
examples
of
the
same
thing
endless
indeed
replied
simmias
and
recollection
is
most
commonly
a
process
of
recovering
that
which
has
been
already
forgotten
through
time
and
inattention
very
true
he
said
well
and
may
you
not
also
from
seeing
the
picture
of
a
horse
or
a
lyre
remember
a
man
and
from
the
picture
of
simmias
you
may
be
led
to
remember
cebes
true
or
you
may
also
be
led
to
the
recollection
of
simmias
himself
quite
so
and
in
all
these
cases
the
recollection
may
be
derived
from
things
either
like
or
unlike
it
may
be
and
when
the
recollection
is
derived
from
like
things
then
another
consideration
is
sure
to
arise
which
is
whether
the
likeness
in
any
degree
falls
short
or
not
of
that
which
is
recollected
very
true
he
said
and
shall
we
proceed
a
step
further
and
affirm
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
equality
not
of
one
piece
of
wood
or
stone
with
another
but
that
over
and
above
this
there
is
absolute
equality
shall
we
say
so
say
so
yes
replied
simmias
and
swear
to
it
with
all
the
confidence
in
life
and
do
we
know
the
nature
of
this
absolute
essence
to
be
sure
he
said
and
whence
did
we
obtain
our
knowledge
did
we
not
see
equalities
of
material
things
such
as
pieces
of
wood
and
stones
and
gather
from
them
the
idea
of
an
equality
which
is
different
from
them
for
you
will
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
difference
or
look
at
the
matter
in
another
way
do
not
the
same
pieces
of
wood
or
stone
appear
at
one
time
equal
and
at
another
time
unequal
that
is
certain
but
are
real
equals
ever
unequal
or
is
the
idea
of
equality
the
same
as
of
inequality
impossible
socrates
then
these
equals
are
not
the
same
with
the
idea
of
equality
i
should
say
clearly
not
socrates
and
yet
from
these
equals
although
differing
from
the
idea
of
equality
you
conceived
and
attained
that
idea
very
true
he
said
which
might
be
like
or
might
be
unlike
them
yes
but
that
makes
no
difference
whenever
from
seeing
one
thing
you
conceived
another
whether
like
or
unlike
there
must
surely
have
been
an
act
of
recollection
very
true
but
what
would
you
say
of
equal
portions
of
wood
and
stone
or
other
material
equals
and
what
is
the
impression
produced
by
them
are
they
equals
in
the
same
sense
in
which
absolute
equality
is
equal
or
do
they
fall
short
of
this
perfect
equality
in
a
measure
yes
he
said
in
a
very
great
measure
too
and
must
we
not
allow
that
when
i
or
any
one
looking
at
any
object
observes
that
the
thing
which
he
sees
aims
at
being
some
other
thing
but
falls
short
of
and
can
not
be
that
other
thing
but
is
inferior
he
who
makes
this
observation
must
have
had
a
previous
knowledge
of
that
to
which
the
other
although
similar
was
inferior
certainly
and
has
not
this
been
our
own
case
in
the
matter
of
equals
and
of
absolute
equality
precisely
then
we
must
have
known
equality
previously
to
the
time
when
we
first
saw
the
material
equals
and
reflected
that
all
these
apparent
equals
strive
to
attain
absolute
equality
but
fall
short
of
it
very
true
and
we
recognize
also
that
this
absolute
equality
has
only
been
known
and
can
only
be
known
through
the
medium
of
sight
or
touch
or
of
some
other
of
the
senses
which
are
all
alike
in
this
respect
yes
socrates
as
far
as
the
argument
is
concerned
one
of
them
is
the
same
as
the
other
from
the
senses
then
is
derived
the
knowledge
that
all
sensible
things
aim
at
an
absolute
equality
of
which
they
fall
short
yes
then
before
we
began
to
see
or
hear
or
perceive
in
any
way
we
must
have
had
a
knowledge
of
absolute
equality
or
we
could
not
have
referred
to
that
standard
the
equals
which
are
derived
from
the
senses
for
to
that
they
all
aspire
and
of
that
they
fall
short
no
other
inference
can
be
drawn
from
the
previous
statements
and
did
we
not
see
and
hear
and
have
the
use
of
our
other
senses
as
soon
as
we
were
born
certainly
then
we
must
have
acquired
the
knowledge
of
equality
at
some
previous
time
yes
that
is
to
say
before
we
were
born
i
suppose
true
and
if
we
acquired
this
knowledge
before
we
were
born
and
were
born
having
the
use
of
it
then
we
also
knew
before
we
were
born
and
at
the
instant
of
birth
not
only
the
equal
or
the
greater
or
the
less
but
all
other
ideas
for
we
are
not
speaking
only
of
equality
but
of
beauty
goodness
justice
holiness
and
of
all
which
we
stamp
with
the
name
of
essence
in
the
dialectical
process
both
when
we
ask
and
when
we
answer
questions
of
all
this
we
may
certainly
affirm
that
we
acquired
the
knowledge
before
birth
we
may
but
if
after
having
acquired
we
have
not
forgotten
what
in
each
case
we
acquired
then
we
must
always
have
come
into
life
having
knowledge
and
shall
always
continue
to
know
as
long
as
life
lasts
for
knowing
is
the
acquiring
and
retaining
knowledge
and
not
forgetting
is
not
forgetting
simmias
just
the
losing
of
knowledge
quite
true
socrates
but
if
the
knowledge
which
we
acquired
before
birth
was
lost
by
us
at
birth
and
if
afterwards
by
the
use
of
the
senses
we
recovered
what
we
previously
knew
will
not
the
process
which
we
call
learning
be
a
recovering
of
the
knowledge
which
is
natural
to
us
and
may
not
this
be
rightly
termed
recollection
very
true
so
much
is
clear
that
when
we
perceive
something
either
by
the
help
of
sight
or
hearing
or
some
other
sense
from
that
perception
we
are
able
to
obtain
a
notion
of
some
other
thing
like
or
unlike
which
is
associated
with
it
but
has
been
forgotten
whence
as
i
was
saying
one
of
two
alternatives
follows
either
we
had
this
knowledge
at
birth
and
continued
to
know
through
life
or
after
birth
those
who
are
said
to
learn
only
remember
and
learning
is
simply
recollection
yes
that
is
quite
true
socrates
and
which
alternative
simmias
do
you
prefer
had
we
the
knowledge
at
our
birth
or
did
we
recollect
the
things
which
we
knew
previously
to
our
birth
i
can
not
decide
at
the
moment
at
any
rate
you
can
decide
whether
he
who
has
knowledge
will
or
will
not
be
able
to
render
an
account
of
his
knowledge
what
do
you
say
certainly
he
will
but
do
you
think
that
every
man
is
able
to
give
an
account
of
these
very
matters
about
which
we
are
speaking
would
that
they
could
socrates
but
i
rather
fear
that
at
this
time
there
will
no
longer
be
any
one
alive
who
is
able
to
give
an
account
of
them
such
as
ought
to
be
given
then
you
are
not
of
opinion
simmias
that
all
men
know
these
things
certainly
not
they
are
in
process
of
recollecting
that
which
they
learned
before
certainly
but
when
did
our
souls
acquire
this
knowledge
not
since
we
were
born
as
men
certainly
not
and
therefore
previously
yes
then
simmias
our
souls
must
also
have
existed
without
bodies
before
they
were
in
the
form
of
man
and
must
have
had
intelligence
unless
indeed
you
suppose
socrates
that
these
notions
are
given
us
at
the
very
moment
of
birth
for
this
is
the
only
time
which
remains
yes
my
friend
but
if
so
when
do
we
lose
them
for
they
are
not
in
us
when
we
are
born
that
is
admitted
do
we
lose
them
at
the
moment
of
receiving
them
or
if
not
at
what
other
time
no
socrates
i
perceive
that
i
was
unconsciously
talking
nonsense
then
may
we
not
say
simmias
that
if
as
we
are
always
repeating
there
is
an
absolute
beauty
and
goodness
and
an
absolute
essence
of
all
things
and
if
to
this
which
is
now
discovered
to
have
existed
in
our
former
state
we
refer
all
our
sensations
and
with
this
compare
them
finding
these
ideas
to
be
and
our
inborn
possession
then
our
souls
must
have
had
a
prior
existence
but
if
not
there
would
be
no
force
in
the
argument
there
is
the
same
proof
that
these
ideas
must
have
existed
before
we
were
born
as
that
our
souls
existed
before
we
were
born
and
if
not
the
ideas
then
not
the
souls
yes
socrates
i
am
convinced
that
there
is
precisely
the
same
necessity
for
the
one
as
for
the
other
and
the
argument
retreats
successfully
to
the
position
that
the
existence
of
the
soul
before
birth
can
not
be
separated
from
the
existence
of
the
essence
of
which
you
speak
for
there
is
nothing
which
to
my
mind
is
so
patent
as
that
beauty
goodness
and
the
other
notions
of
which
you
were
just
now
speaking
have
a
most
real
and
absolute
existence
and
i
am
satisfied
with
the
proof
well
but
is
cebes
equally
satisfied
for
i
must
convince
him
too
i
think
said
simmias
that
cebes
is
satisfied
although
he
is
the
most
incredulous
of
mortals
yet
i
believe
that
he
is
sufficiently
convinced
of
the
existence
of
the
soul
before
birth
but
that
after
death
the
soul
will
continue
to
exist
is
not
yet
proven
even
to
my
own
satisfaction
i
can
not
get
rid
of
the
feeling
of
the
many
to
which
cebes
was
referring
the
feeling
that
when
the
man
dies
the
soul
will
be
dispersed
and
that
this
may
be
the
extinction
of
her
for
admitting
that
she
may
have
been
born
elsewhere
and
framed
out
of
other
elements
and
was
in
existence
before
entering
the
human
body
why
after
having
entered
in
and
gone
out
again
may
she
not
herself
be
destroyed
and
come
to
an
end
very
true
simmias
said
cebes
about
half
of
what
was
required
has
been
proven
to
wit
that
our
souls
existed
before
we
were
born
that
the
soul
will
exist
after
death
as
well
as
before
birth
is
the
other
half
of
which
the
proof
is
still
wanting
and
has
to
be
supplied
when
that
is
given
the
demonstration
will
be
complete
but
that
proof
simmias
and
cebes
has
been
already
given
said
socrates
if
you
put
the
two
arguments
together
i
mean
this
and
the
former
one
in
which
we
admitted
that
everything
living
is
born
of
the
dead
for
if
the
soul
exists
before
birth
and
in
coming
to
life
and
being
born
can
be
born
only
from
death
and
dying
must
she
not
after
death
continue
to
exist
since
she
has
to
be
born
again
surely
the
proof
which
you
desire
has
been
already
furnished
still
i
suspect
that
you
and
simmias
would
be
glad
to
probe
the
argument
further
like
children
you
are
haunted
with
a
fear
that
when
the
soul
leaves
the
body
the
wind
may
really
blow
her
away
and
scatter
her
especially
if
a
man
should
happen
to
die
in
a
great
storm
and
not
when
the
sky
is
calm
cebes
answered
with
a
smile
then
socrates
you
must
argue
us
out
of
our
fears
and
yet
strictly
speaking
they
are
not
our
fears
but
there
is
a
child
within
us
to
whom
death
is
a
sort
of
hobgoblin
him
too
we
must
persuade
not
to
be
afraid
when
he
is
alone
in
the
dark
socrates
said
let
the
voice
of
the
charmer
be
applied
daily
until
you
have
charmed
away
the
fear
and
where
shall
we
find
a
good
charmer
of
our
fears
socrates
when
you
are
gone
hellas
he
replied
is
a
large
place
cebes
and
has
many
good
men
and
there
are
barbarous
races
not
a
few
seek
for
him
among
them
all
far
and
wide
sparing
neither
pains
nor
money
for
there
is
no
better
way
of
spending
your
money
and
you
must
seek
among
yourselves
too
for
you
will
not
find
others
better
able
to
make
the
search
the
search
replied
cebes
shall
certainly
be
made
and
now
if
you
please
let
us
return
to
the
point
of
the
argument
at
which
we
digressed
by
all
means
replied
socrates
what
else
should
i
please
very
good
must
we
not
said
socrates
ask
ourselves
what
that
is
which
as
we
imagine
is
liable
to
be
scattered
and
about
which
we
fear
and
what
again
is
that
about
which
we
have
no
fear
and
then
we
may
proceed
further
to
enquire
whether
that
which
suffers
dispersion
is
or
is
not
of
the
nature
of
soul
our
hopes
and
fears
as
to
our
own
souls
will
turn
upon
the
answers
to
these
questions
very
true
he
said
now
the
compound
or
composite
may
be
supposed
to
be
naturally
capable
as
of
being
compounded
so
also
of
being
dissolved
but
that
which
is
uncompounded
and
that
only
must
be
if
anything
is
indissoluble
yes
i
should
imagine
so
said
cebes
and
the
uncompounded
may
be
assumed
to
be
the
same
and
unchanging
whereas
the
compound
is
always
changing
and
never
the
same
i
agree
he
said
then
now
let
us
return
to
the
previous
discussion
is
that
idea
or
essence
which
in
the
dialectical
process
we
define
as
essence
or
true
existence
whether
essence
of
equality
beauty
or
anything
else
are
these
essences
i
say
liable
at
times
to
some
degree
of
change
or
are
they
each
of
them
always
what
they
are
having
the
same
simple
and
unchanging
forms
not
admitting
of
variation
at
all
or
in
any
way
or
at
any
time
they
must
be
always
the
same
socrates
replied
cebes
and
what
would
you
say
of
the
many
beautiful
whether
men
or
horses
or
garments
or
any
other
things
which
are
named
by
the
same
names
and
may
be
called
equal
or
beautiful
are
they
all
unchanging
and
the
same
always
or
quite
the
reverse
may
they
not
rather
be
described
as
almost
always
changing
and
hardly
ever
the
same
either
with
themselves
or
with
one
another
the
latter
replied
cebes
they
are
always
in
a
state
of
change
and
these
you
can
touch
and
see
and
perceive
with
the
senses
but
the
unchanging
things
you
can
only
perceive
with
the
mind
they
are
invisible
and
are
not
seen
that
is
very
true
he
said
well
then
added
socrates
let
us
suppose
that
there
are
two
sorts
of
existences
one
seen
the
other
unseen
let
us
suppose
them
the
seen
is
the
changing
and
the
unseen
is
the
unchanging
that
may
be
also
supposed
and
further
is
not
one
part
of
us
body
another
part
soul
to
be
sure
and
to
which
class
is
the
body
more
alike
and
akin
clearly
to
the
seen
no
one
can
doubt
that
and
is
the
soul
seen
or
not
seen
not
by
man
socrates
and
what
we
mean
by
and
seen
is
that
which
is
or
is
not
visible
to
the
eye
of
man
yes
to
the
eye
of
man
and
is
the
soul
seen
or
not
seen
not
seen
unseen
then
yes
then
the
soul
is
more
like
to
the
unseen
and
the
body
to
the
seen
that
follows
necessarily
socrates
and
were
we
not
saying
long
ago
that
the
soul
when
using
the
body
as
an
instrument
of
perception
that
is
to
say
when
using
the
sense
of
sight
or
hearing
or
some
other
sense
for
the
meaning
of
perceiving
through
the
body
is
perceiving
through
the
senses
were
we
not
saying
that
the
soul
too
is
then
dragged
by
the
body
into
the
region
of
the
changeable
and
wanders
and
is
confused
the
world
spins
round
her
and
she
is
like
a
drunkard
when
she
touches
change
very
true
but
when
returning
into
herself
she
reflects
then
she
passes
into
the
other
world
the
region
of
purity
and
eternity
and
immortality
and
unchangeableness
which
are
her
kindred
and
with
them
she
ever
lives
when
she
is
by
herself
and
is
not
let
or
hindered
then
she
ceases
from
her
erring
ways
and
being
in
communion
with
the
unchanging
is
unchanging
and
this
state
of
the
soul
is
called
wisdom
that
is
well
and
truly
said
socrates
he
replied
and
to
which
class
is
the
soul
more
nearly
alike
and
akin
as
far
as
may
be
inferred
from
this
argument
as
well
as
from
the
preceding
one
i
think
socrates
that
in
the
opinion
of
every
one
who
follows
the
argument
the
soul
will
be
infinitely
more
like
the
unchangeable
even
the
most
stupid
person
will
not
deny
that
and
the
body
is
more
like
the
changing
yes
yet
once
more
consider
the
matter
in
another
light
when
the
soul
and
the
body
are
united
then
nature
orders
the
soul
to
rule
and
govern
and
the
body
to
obey
and
serve
now
which
of
these
two
functions
is
akin
to
the
divine
and
which
to
the
mortal
does
not
the
divine
appear
to
you
to
be
that
which
naturally
orders
and
rules
and
the
mortal
to
be
that
which
is
subject
and
servant
true
and
which
does
the
soul
resemble
the
soul
resembles
the
divine
and
the
body
the
mortal
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
socrates
then
reflect
cebes
of
all
which
has
been
said
is
not
this
the
conclusion
that
the
soul
is
in
the
very
likeness
of
the
divine
and
immortal
and
intellectual
and
uniform
and
indissoluble
and
unchangeable
and
that
the
body
is
in
the
very
likeness
of
the
human
and
mortal
and
unintellectual
and
multiform
and
dissoluble
and
changeable
can
this
my
dear
cebes
be
denied
it
can
not
but
if
it
be
true
then
is
not
the
body
liable
to
speedy
dissolution
and
is
not
the
soul
almost
or
altogether
indissoluble
certainly
and
do
you
further
observe
that
after
a
man
is
dead
the
body
or
visible
part
of
him
which
is
lying
in
the
visible
world
and
is
called
a
corpse
and
would
naturally
be
dissolved
and
decomposed
and
dissipated
is
not
dissolved
or
decomposed
at
once
but
may
remain
for
a
for
some
time
nay
even
for
a
long
time
if
the
constitution
be
sound
at
the
time
of
death
and
the
season
of
the
year
favourable
for
the
body
when
shrunk
and
embalmed
as
the
manner
is
in
egypt
may
remain
almost
entire
through
infinite
ages
and
even
in
decay
there
are
still
some
portions
such
as
the
bones
and
ligaments
which
are
practically
indestructible
do
you
agree
yes
and
is
it
likely
that
the
soul
which
is
invisible
in
passing
to
the
place
of
the
true
hades
which
like
her
is
invisible
and
pure
and
noble
and
on
her
way
to
the
good
and
wise
god
whither
if
god
will
my
soul
is
also
soon
to
go
that
the
soul
i
repeat
if
this
be
her
nature
and
origin
will
be
blown
away
and
destroyed
immediately
on
quitting
the
body
as
the
many
say
that
can
never
be
my
dear
simmias
and
cebes
the
truth
rather
is
that
the
soul
which
is
pure
at
departing
and
draws
after
her
no
bodily
taint
having
never
voluntarily
during
life
had
connection
with
the
body
which
she
is
ever
avoiding
herself
gathered
into
herself
and
making
such
abstraction
her
perpetual
study
which
means
that
she
has
been
a
true
disciple
of
philosophy
and
therefore
has
in
fact
been
always
engaged
in
the
practice
of
dying
for
is
not
philosophy
the
practice
of
death
certainly
that
soul
i
say
herself
invisible
departs
to
the
invisible
world
to
the
divine
and
immortal
and
rational
thither
arriving
she
is
secure
of
bliss
and
is
released
from
the
error
and
folly
of
men
their
fears
and
wild
passions
and
all
other
human
ills
and
for
ever
dwells
as
they
say
of
the
initiated
in
company
with
the
gods
compare
is
not
this
true
cebes
yes
said
cebes
beyond
a
doubt
but
the
soul
which
has
been
polluted
and
is
impure
at
the
time
of
her
departure
and
is
the
companion
and
servant
of
the
body
always
and
is
in
love
with
and
fascinated
by
the
body
and
by
the
desires
and
pleasures
of
the
body
until
she
is
led
to
believe
that
the
truth
only
exists
in
a
bodily
form
which
a
man
may
touch
and
see
and
taste
and
use
for
the
purposes
of
his
lusts
the
soul
i
mean
accustomed
to
hate
and
fear
and
avoid
the
intellectual
principle
which
to
the
bodily
eye
is
dark
and
invisible
and
can
be
attained
only
by
philosophy
do
you
suppose
that
such
a
soul
will
depart
pure
and
unalloyed
impossible
he
replied
she
is
held
fast
by
the
corporeal
which
the
continual
association
and
constant
care
of
the
body
have
wrought
into
her
nature
very
true
and
this
corporeal
element
my
friend
is
heavy
and
weighty
and
earthy
and
is
that
element
of
sight
by
which
a
soul
is
depressed
and
dragged
down
again
into
the
visible
world
because
she
is
afraid
of
the
invisible
and
of
the
world
below
prowling
about
tombs
and
sepulchres
near
which
as
they
tell
us
are
seen
certain
ghostly
apparitions
of
souls
which
have
not
departed
pure
but
are
cloyed
with
sight
and
therefore
visible
compare
milton
comus
when
lust
by
unchaste
looks
loose
gestures
and
foul
talk
but
most
by
lewd
and
lavish
act
of
sin
lets
in
defilement
to
the
inward
parts
the
soul
grows
clotted
by
contagion
imbodies
and
imbrutes
till
she
quite
lose
the
divine
property
of
her
first
being
such
are
those
thick
and
gloomy
shadows
damp
oft
seen
in
charnel
vaults
and
sepulchres
lingering
and
sitting
by
a
new
made
grave
as
loath
to
leave
the
body
that
it
lov
and
linked
itself
by
carnal
sensuality
to
a
degenerate
and
degraded
state
that
is
very
likely
socrates
yes
that
is
very
likely
cebes
and
these
must
be
the
souls
not
of
the
good
but
of
the
evil
which
are
compelled
to
wander
about
such
places
in
payment
of
the
penalty
of
their
former
evil
way
of
life
and
they
continue
to
wander
until
through
the
craving
after
the
corporeal
which
never
leaves
them
they
are
imprisoned
finally
in
another
body
and
they
may
be
supposed
to
find
their
prisons
in
the
same
natures
which
they
have
had
in
their
former
lives
what
natures
do
you
mean
socrates
what
i
mean
is
that
men
who
have
followed
after
gluttony
and
wantonness
and
drunkenness
and
have
had
no
thought
of
avoiding
them
would
pass
into
asses
and
animals
of
that
sort
what
do
you
think
i
think
such
an
opinion
to
be
exceedingly
probable
and
those
who
have
chosen
the
portion
of
injustice
and
tyranny
and
violence
will
pass
into
wolves
or
into
hawks
and
kites
whither
else
can
we
suppose
them
to
go
yes
said
cebes
with
such
natures
beyond
question
and
there
is
no
difficulty
he
said
in
assigning
to
all
of
them
places
answering
to
their
several
natures
and
propensities
there
is
not
he
said
some
are
happier
than
others
and
the
happiest
both
in
themselves
and
in
the
place
to
which
they
go
are
those
who
have
practised
the
civil
and
social
virtues
which
are
called
temperance
and
justice
and
are
acquired
by
habit
and
attention
without
philosophy
and
mind
compare
republic
why
are
they
the
happiest
because
they
may
be
expected
to
pass
into
some
gentle
and
social
kind
which
is
like
their
own
such
as
bees
or
wasps
or
ants
or
back
again
into
the
form
of
man
and
just
and
moderate
men
may
be
supposed
to
spring
from
them
very
likely
no
one
who
has
not
studied
philosophy
and
who
is
not
entirely
pure
at
the
time
of
his
departure
is
allowed
to
enter
the
company
of
the
gods
but
the
lover
of
knowledge
only
and
this
is
the
reason
simmias
and
cebes
why
the
true
votaries
of
philosophy
abstain
from
all
fleshly
lusts
and
hold
out
against
them
and
refuse
to
give
themselves
up
to
them
not
because
they
fear
poverty
or
the
ruin
of
their
families
like
the
lovers
of
money
and
the
world
in
general
nor
like
the
lovers
of
power
and
honour
because
they
dread
the
dishonour
or
disgrace
of
evil
deeds
no
socrates
that
would
not
become
them
said
cebes
no
indeed
he
replied
and
therefore
they
who
have
any
care
of
their
own
souls
and
do
not
merely
live
moulding
and
fashioning
the
body
say
farewell
to
all
this
they
will
not
walk
in
the
ways
of
the
blind
and
when
philosophy
offers
them
purification
and
release
from
evil
they
feel
that
they
ought
not
to
resist
her
influence
and
whither
she
leads
they
turn
and
follow
what
do
you
mean
socrates
i
will
tell
you
he
said
the
lovers
of
knowledge
are
conscious
that
the
soul
was
simply
fastened
and
glued
to
the
body
until
philosophy
received
her
she
could
only
view
real
existence
through
the
bars
of
a
prison
not
in
and
through
herself
she
was
wallowing
in
the
mire
of
every
sort
of
ignorance
and
by
reason
of
lust
had
become
the
principal
accomplice
in
her
own
captivity
this
was
her
original
state
and
then
as
i
was
saying
and
as
the
lovers
of
knowledge
are
well
aware
philosophy
seeing
how
terrible
was
her
confinement
of
which
she
was
to
herself
the
cause
received
and
gently
comforted
her
and
sought
to
release
her
pointing
out
that
the
eye
and
the
ear
and
the
other
senses
are
full
of
deception
and
persuading
her
to
retire
from
them
and
abstain
from
all
but
the
necessary
use
of
them
and
be
gathered
up
and
collected
into
herself
bidding
her
trust
in
herself
and
her
own
pure
apprehension
of
pure
existence
and
to
mistrust
whatever
comes
to
her
through
other
channels
and
is
subject
to
variation
for
such
things
are
visible
and
tangible
but
what
she
sees
in
her
own
nature
is
intelligible
and
invisible
and
the
soul
of
the
true
philosopher
thinks
that
she
ought
not
to
resist
this
deliverance
and
therefore
abstains
from
pleasures
and
desires
and
pains
and
fears
as
far
as
she
is
able
reflecting
that
when
a
man
has
great
joys
or
sorrows
or
fears
or
desires
he
suffers
from
them
not
merely
the
sort
of
evil
which
might
be
anticipated
as
for
example
the
loss
of
his
health
or
property
which
he
has
sacrificed
to
his
lusts
but
an
evil
greater
far
which
is
the
greatest
and
worst
of
all
evils
and
one
of
which
he
never
thinks
what
is
it
socrates
said
cebes
the
evil
is
that
when
the
feeling
of
pleasure
or
pain
is
most
intense
every
soul
of
man
imagines
the
objects
of
this
intense
feeling
to
be
then
plainest
and
truest
but
this
is
not
so
they
are
really
the
things
of
sight
very
true
and
is
not
this
the
state
in
which
the
soul
is
most
enthralled
by
the
body
how
so
why
because
each
pleasure
and
pain
is
a
sort
of
nail
which
nails
and
rivets
the
soul
to
the
body
until
she
becomes
like
the
body
and
believes
that
to
be
true
which
the
body
affirms
to
be
true
and
from
agreeing
with
the
body
and
having
the
same
delights
she
is
obliged
to
have
the
same
habits
and
haunts
and
is
not
likely
ever
to
be
pure
at
her
departure
to
the
world
below
but
is
always
infected
by
the
body
and
so
she
sinks
into
another
body
and
there
germinates
and
grows
and
has
therefore
no
part
in
the
communion
of
the
divine
and
pure
and
simple
most
true
socrates
answered
cebes
and
this
cebes
is
the
reason
why
the
true
lovers
of
knowledge
are
temperate
and
brave
and
not
for
the
reason
which
the
world
gives
certainly
not
certainly
not
the
soul
of
a
philosopher
will
reason
in
quite
another
way
she
will
not
ask
philosophy
to
release
her
in
order
that
when
released
she
may
deliver
herself
up
again
to
the
thraldom
of
pleasures
and
pains
doing
a
work
only
to
be
undone
again
weaving
instead
of
unweaving
her
penelope
web
but
she
will
calm
passion
and
follow
reason
and
dwell
in
the
contemplation
of
her
beholding
the
true
and
divine
which
is
not
matter
of
opinion
and
thence
deriving
nourishment
thus
she
seeks
to
live
while
she
lives
and
after
death
she
hopes
to
go
to
her
own
kindred
and
to
that
which
is
like
her
and
to
be
freed
from
human
ills
never
fear
simmias
and
cebes
that
a
soul
which
has
been
thus
nurtured
and
has
had
these
pursuits
will
at
her
departure
from
the
body
be
scattered
and
blown
away
by
the
winds
and
be
nowhere
and
nothing
when
socrates
had
done
speaking
for
a
considerable
time
there
was
silence
he
himself
appeared
to
be
meditating
as
most
of
us
were
on
what
had
been
said
only
cebes
and
simmias
spoke
a
few
words
to
one
another
and
socrates
observing
them
asked
what
they
thought
of
the
argument
and
whether
there
was
anything
wanting
for
said
he
there
are
many
points
still
open
to
suspicion
and
attack
if
any
one
were
disposed
to
sift
the
matter
thoroughly
should
you
be
considering
some
other
matter
i
say
no
more
but
if
you
are
still
in
doubt
do
not
hesitate
to
say
exactly
what
you
think
and
let
us
have
anything
better
which
you
can
suggest
and
if
you
think
that
i
can
be
of
any
use
allow
me
to
help
you
simmias
said
i
must
confess
socrates
that
doubts
did
arise
in
our
minds
and
each
of
us
was
urging
and
inciting
the
other
to
put
the
question
which
we
wanted
to
have
answered
and
which
neither
of
us
liked
to
ask
fearing
that
our
importunity
might
be
troublesome
under
present
at
such
a
time
socrates
replied
with
a
smile
o
simmias
what
are
you
saying
i
am
not
very
likely
to
persuade
other
men
that
i
do
not
regard
my
present
situation
as
a
misfortune
if
i
can
not
even
persuade
you
that
i
am
no
worse
off
now
than
at
any
other
time
in
my
life
will
you
not
allow
that
i
have
as
much
of
the
spirit
of
prophecy
in
me
as
the
swans
for
they
when
they
perceive
that
they
must
die
having
sung
all
their
life
long
do
then
sing
more
lustily
than
ever
rejoicing
in
the
thought
that
they
are
about
to
go
away
to
the
god
whose
ministers
they
are
but
men
because
they
are
themselves
afraid
of
death
slanderously
affirm
of
the
swans
that
they
sing
a
lament
at
the
last
not
considering
that
no
bird
sings
when
cold
or
hungry
or
in
pain
not
even
the
nightingale
nor
the
swallow
nor
yet
the
hoopoe
which
are
said
indeed
to
tune
a
lay
of
sorrow
although
i
do
not
believe
this
to
be
true
of
them
any
more
than
of
the
swans
but
because
they
are
sacred
to
apollo
they
have
the
gift
of
prophecy
and
anticipate
the
good
things
of
another
world
wherefore
they
sing
and
rejoice
in
that
day
more
than
they
ever
did
before
and
i
too
believing
myself
to
be
the
consecrated
servant
of
the
same
god
and
the
of
the
swans
and
thinking
that
i
have
received
from
my
master
gifts
of
prophecy
which
are
not
inferior
to
theirs
would
not
go
out
of
life
less
merrily
than
the
swans
never
mind
then
if
this
be
your
only
objection
but
speak
and
ask
anything
which
you
like
while
the
eleven
magistrates
of
athens
allow
very
good
socrates
said
simmias
then
i
will
tell
you
my
difficulty
and
cebes
will
tell
you
his
i
feel
myself
and
i
daresay
that
you
have
the
same
feeling
how
hard
or
rather
impossible
is
the
attainment
of
any
certainty
about
questions
such
as
these
in
the
present
life
and
yet
i
should
deem
him
a
coward
who
did
not
prove
what
is
said
about
them
to
the
uttermost
or
whose
heart
failed
him
before
he
had
examined
them
on
every
side
for
he
should
persevere
until
he
has
achieved
one
of
two
things
either
he
should
discover
or
be
taught
the
truth
about
them
or
if
this
be
impossible
i
would
have
him
take
the
best
and
most
irrefragable
of
human
theories
and
let
this
be
the
raft
upon
which
he
sails
through
life
not
without
risk
as
i
admit
if
he
can
not
find
some
word
of
god
which
will
more
surely
and
safely
carry
him
and
now
as
you
bid
me
i
will
venture
to
question
you
and
then
i
shall
not
have
to
reproach
myself
hereafter
with
not
having
said
at
the
time
what
i
think
for
when
i
consider
the
matter
either
alone
or
with
cebes
the
argument
does
certainly
appear
to
me
socrates
to
be
not
sufficient
socrates
answered
i
dare
say
my
friend
that
you
may
be
right
but
i
should
like
to
know
in
what
respect
the
argument
is
insufficient
in
this
respect
replied
simmias
suppose
a
person
to
use
the
same
argument
about
harmony
and
the
lyre
might
he
not
say
that
harmony
is
a
thing
invisible
incorporeal
perfect
divine
existing
in
the
lyre
which
is
harmonized
but
that
the
lyre
and
the
strings
are
matter
and
material
composite
earthy
and
akin
to
mortality
and
when
some
one
breaks
the
lyre
or
cuts
and
rends
the
strings
then
he
who
takes
this
view
would
argue
as
you
do
and
on
the
same
analogy
that
the
harmony
survives
and
has
not
perished
you
can
not
imagine
he
would
say
that
the
lyre
without
the
strings
and
the
broken
strings
themselves
which
are
mortal
remain
and
yet
that
the
harmony
which
is
of
heavenly
and
immortal
nature
and
kindred
has
perished
perished
before
the
mortal
the
harmony
must
still
be
somewhere
and
the
wood
and
strings
will
decay
before
anything
can
happen
to
that
the
thought
socrates
must
have
occurred
to
your
own
mind
that
such
is
our
conception
of
the
soul
and
that
when
the
body
is
in
a
manner
strung
and
held
together
by
the
elements
of
hot
and
cold
wet
and
dry
then
the
soul
is
the
harmony
or
due
proportionate
admixture
of
them
but
if
so
whenever
the
strings
of
the
body
are
unduly
loosened
or
overstrained
through
disease
or
other
injury
then
the
soul
though
most
divine
like
other
harmonies
of
music
or
of
works
of
art
of
course
perishes
at
once
although
the
material
remains
of
the
body
may
last
for
a
considerable
time
until
they
are
either
decayed
or
burnt
and
if
any
one
maintains
that
the
soul
being
the
harmony
of
the
elements
of
the
body
is
first
to
perish
in
that
which
is
called
death
how
shall
we
answer
him
socrates
looked
fixedly
at
us
as
his
manner
was
and
said
with
a
smile
simmias
has
reason
on
his
side
and
why
does
not
some
one
of
you
who
is
better
able
than
myself
answer
him
for
there
is
force
in
his
attack
upon
me
but
perhaps
before
we
answer
him
we
had
better
also
hear
what
cebes
has
to
say
that
we
may
gain
time
for
reflection
and
when
they
have
both
spoken
we
may
either
assent
to
them
if
there
is
truth
in
what
they
say
or
if
not
we
will
maintain
our
position
please
to
tell
me
then
cebes
he
said
what
was
the
difficulty
which
troubled
you
cebes
said
i
will
tell
you
my
feeling
is
that
the
argument
is
where
it
was
and
open
to
the
same
objections
which
were
urged
before
for
i
am
ready
to
admit
that
the
existence
of
the
soul
before
entering
into
the
bodily
form
has
been
very
ingeniously
and
if
i
may
say
so
quite
sufficiently
proven
but
the
existence
of
the
soul
after
death
is
still
in
my
judgment
unproven
now
my
objection
is
not
the
same
as
that
of
simmias
for
i
am
not
disposed
to
deny
that
the
soul
is
stronger
and
more
lasting
than
the
body
being
of
opinion
that
in
all
such
respects
the
soul
very
far
excels
the
body
well
then
says
the
argument
to
me
why
do
you
remain
unconvinced
when
you
see
that
the
weaker
continues
in
existence
after
the
man
is
dead
will
you
not
admit
that
the
more
lasting
must
also
survive
during
the
same
period
of
time
now
i
will
ask
you
to
consider
whether
the
objection
which
like
simmias
i
will
express
in
a
figure
is
of
any
weight
the
analogy
which
i
will
adduce
is
that
of
an
old
weaver
who
dies
and
after
his
death
somebody
says
he
is
not
dead
he
must
be
alive
see
there
is
the
coat
which
he
himself
wove
and
wore
and
which
remains
whole
and
undecayed
and
then
he
proceeds
to
ask
of
some
one
who
is
incredulous
whether
a
man
lasts
longer
or
the
coat
which
is
in
use
and
wear
and
when
he
is
answered
that
a
man
lasts
far
longer
thinks
that
he
has
thus
certainly
demonstrated
the
survival
of
the
man
who
is
the
more
lasting
because
the
less
lasting
remains
but
that
simmias
as
i
would
beg
you
to
remark
is
a
mistake
any
one
can
see
that
he
who
talks
thus
is
talking
nonsense
for
the
truth
is
that
the
weaver
aforesaid
having
woven
and
worn
many
such
coats
outlived
several
of
them
and
was
outlived
by
the
last
but
a
man
is
not
therefore
proved
to
be
slighter
and
weaker
than
a
coat
now
the
relation
of
the
body
to
the
soul
may
be
expressed
in
a
similar
figure
and
any
one
may
very
fairly
say
in
like
manner
that
the
soul
is
lasting
and
the
body
weak
and
shortlived
in
comparison
he
may
argue
in
like
manner
that
every
soul
wears
out
many
bodies
especially
if
a
man
live
many
years
while
he
is
alive
the
body
deliquesces
and
decays
and
the
soul
always
weaves
another
garment
and
repairs
the
waste
but
of
course
whenever
the
soul
perishes
she
must
have
on
her
last
garment
and
this
will
survive
her
and
then
at
length
when
the
soul
is
dead
the
body
will
show
its
native
weakness
and
quickly
decompose
and
pass
away
i
would
therefore
rather
not
rely
on
the
argument
from
superior
strength
to
prove
the
continued
existence
of
the
soul
after
death
for
granting
even
more
than
you
affirm
to
be
possible
and
acknowledging
not
only
that
the
soul
existed
before
birth
but
also
that
the
souls
of
some
exist
and
will
continue
to
exist
after
death
and
will
be
born
and
die
again
and
again
and
that
there
is
a
natural
strength
in
the
soul
which
will
hold
out
and
be
born
many
times
nevertheless
we
may
be
still
inclined
to
think
that
she
will
weary
in
the
labours
of
successive
births
and
may
at
last
succumb
in
one
of
her
deaths
and
utterly
perish
and
this
death
and
dissolution
of
the
body
which
brings
destruction
to
the
soul
may
be
unknown
to
any
of
us
for
no
one
of
us
can
have
had
any
experience
of
it
and
if
so
then
i
maintain
that
he
who
is
confident
about
death
has
but
a
foolish
confidence
unless
he
is
able
to
prove
that
the
soul
is
altogether
immortal
and
imperishable
but
if
he
can
not
prove
the
immortality
he
who
is
about
to
die
will
always
have
reason
to
fear
that
when
the
body
is
disunited
the
soul
also
may
utterly
perish
all
of
us
as
we
afterwards
remarked
to
one
another
had
an
unpleasant
feeling
at
hearing
what
they
said
when
we
had
been
so
firmly
convinced
before
now
to
have
our
faith
shaken
seemed
to
introduce
a
confusion
and
uncertainty
not
only
into
the
previous
argument
but
into
any
future
one
either
we
were
incapable
of
forming
a
judgment
or
there
were
no
grounds
of
belief
echecrates
there
i
feel
with
you
by
heaven
i
do
phaedo
and
when
you
were
speaking
i
was
beginning
to
ask
myself
the
same
question
what
argument
can
i
ever
trust
again
for
what
could
be
more
convincing
than
the
argument
of
socrates
which
has
now
fallen
into
discredit
that
the
soul
is
a
harmony
is
a
doctrine
which
has
always
had
a
wonderful
attraction
for
me
and
when
mentioned
came
back
to
me
at
once
as
my
own
original
conviction
and
now
i
must
begin
again
and
find
another
argument
which
will
assure
me
that
when
the
man
is
dead
the
soul
survives
tell
me
i
implore
you
how
did
socrates
proceed
did
he
appear
to
share
the
unpleasant
feeling
which
you
mention
or
did
he
calmly
meet
the
attack
and
did
he
answer
forcibly
or
feebly
narrate
what
passed
as
exactly
as
you
can
phaedo
often
echecrates
i
have
wondered
at
socrates
but
never
more
than
on
that
occasion
that
he
should
be
able
to
answer
was
nothing
but
what
astonished
me
was
first
the
gentle
and
pleasant
and
approving
manner
in
which
he
received
the
words
of
the
young
men
and
then
his
quick
sense
of
the
wound
which
had
been
inflicted
by
the
argument
and
the
readiness
with
which
he
healed
it
he
might
be
compared
to
a
general
rallying
his
defeated
and
broken
army
urging
them
to
accompany
him
and
return
to
the
field
of
argument
echecrates
what
followed
phaedo
you
shall
hear
for
i
was
close
to
him
on
his
right
hand
seated
on
a
sort
of
stool
and
he
on
a
couch
which
was
a
good
deal
higher
he
stroked
my
head
and
pressed
the
hair
upon
my
neck
he
had
a
way
of
playing
with
my
hair
and
then
he
said
phaedo
i
suppose
that
these
fair
locks
of
yours
will
be
severed
yes
socrates
i
suppose
that
they
will
i
replied
not
so
if
you
will
take
my
advice
what
shall
i
do
with
them
i
said
he
replied
and
not
if
this
argument
dies
and
we
can
not
bring
it
to
life
again
you
and
i
will
both
shave
our
locks
and
if
i
were
you
and
the
argument
got
away
from
me
and
i
could
not
hold
my
ground
against
simmias
and
cebes
i
would
myself
take
an
oath
like
the
argives
not
to
wear
hair
any
more
until
i
had
renewed
the
conflict
and
defeated
them
yes
i
said
but
heracles
himself
is
said
not
to
be
a
match
for
two
summon
me
then
he
said
and
i
will
be
your
iolaus
until
the
sun
goes
down
i
summon
you
rather
i
rejoined
not
as
heracles
summoning
iolaus
but
as
iolaus
might
summon
heracles
that
will
do
as
well
he
said
but
first
let
us
take
care
that
we
avoid
a
danger
of
what
nature
i
said
lest
we
become
misologists
he
replied
no
worse
thing
can
happen
to
a
man
than
this
for
as
there
are
misanthropists
or
haters
of
men
there
are
also
misologists
or
haters
of
ideas
and
both
spring
from
the
same
cause
which
is
ignorance
of
the
world
misanthropy
arises
out
of
the
too
great
confidence
of
inexperience
you
trust
a
man
and
think
him
altogether
true
and
sound
and
faithful
and
then
in
a
little
while
he
turns
out
to
be
false
and
knavish
and
then
another
and
another
and
when
this
has
happened
several
times
to
a
man
especially
when
it
happens
among
those
whom
he
deems
to
be
his
own
most
trusted
and
familiar
friends
and
he
has
often
quarreled
with
them
he
at
last
hates
all
men
and
believes
that
no
one
has
any
good
in
him
at
all
you
must
have
observed
this
trait
of
character
i
have
and
is
not
the
feeling
discreditable
is
it
not
obvious
that
such
an
one
having
to
deal
with
other
men
was
clearly
without
any
experience
of
human
nature
for
experience
would
have
taught
him
the
true
state
of
the
case
that
few
are
the
good
and
few
the
evil
and
that
the
great
majority
are
in
the
interval
between
them
what
do
you
mean
i
said
i
mean
he
replied
as
you
might
say
of
the
very
large
and
very
small
that
nothing
is
more
uncommon
than
a
very
large
or
very
small
man
and
this
applies
generally
to
all
extremes
whether
of
great
and
small
or
swift
and
slow
or
fair
and
foul
or
black
and
white
and
whether
the
instances
you
select
be
men
or
dogs
or
anything
else
few
are
the
extremes
but
many
are
in
the
mean
between
them
did
you
never
observe
this
yes
i
said
i
have
and
do
you
not
imagine
he
said
that
if
there
were
a
competition
in
evil
the
worst
would
be
found
to
be
very
few
yes
that
is
very
likely
i
said
yes
that
is
very
likely
he
replied
although
in
this
respect
arguments
are
unlike
men
there
i
was
led
on
by
you
to
say
more
than
i
had
intended
but
the
point
of
comparison
was
that
when
a
simple
man
who
has
no
skill
in
dialectics
believes
an
argument
to
be
true
which
he
afterwards
imagines
to
be
false
whether
really
false
or
not
and
then
another
and
another
he
has
no
longer
any
faith
left
and
great
disputers
as
you
know
come
to
think
at
last
that
they
have
grown
to
be
the
wisest
of
mankind
for
they
alone
perceive
the
utter
unsoundness
and
instability
of
all
arguments
or
indeed
of
all
things
which
like
the
currents
in
the
euripus
are
going
up
and
down
in
ebb
and
flow
that
is
quite
true
i
said
yes
phaedo
he
replied
and
how
melancholy
if
there
be
such
a
thing
as
truth
or
certainty
or
possibility
of
knowledge
that
a
man
should
have
lighted
upon
some
argument
or
other
which
at
first
seemed
true
and
then
turned
out
to
be
false
and
instead
of
blaming
himself
and
his
own
want
of
wit
because
he
is
annoyed
should
at
last
be
too
glad
to
transfer
the
blame
from
himself
to
arguments
in
general
and
for
ever
afterwards
should
hate
and
revile
them
and
lose
truth
and
the
knowledge
of
realities
yes
indeed
i
said
that
is
very
melancholy
let
us
then
in
the
first
place
he
said
be
careful
of
allowing
or
of
admitting
into
our
souls
the
notion
that
there
is
no
health
or
soundness
in
any
arguments
at
all
rather
say
that
we
have
not
yet
attained
to
soundness
in
ourselves
and
that
we
must
struggle
manfully
and
do
our
best
to
gain
health
of
mind
you
and
all
other
men
having
regard
to
the
whole
of
your
future
life
and
i
myself
in
the
prospect
of
death
for
at
this
moment
i
am
sensible
that
i
have
not
the
temper
of
a
philosopher
like
the
vulgar
i
am
only
a
partisan
now
the
partisan
when
he
is
engaged
in
a
dispute
cares
nothing
about
the
rights
of
the
question
but
is
anxious
only
to
convince
his
hearers
of
his
own
assertions
and
the
difference
between
him
and
me
at
the
present
moment
is
merely
this
that
whereas
he
seeks
to
convince
his
hearers
that
what
he
says
is
true
i
am
rather
seeking
to
convince
myself
to
convince
my
hearers
is
a
secondary
matter
with
me
and
do
but
see
how
much
i
gain
by
the
argument
for
if
what
i
say
is
true
then
i
do
well
to
be
persuaded
of
the
truth
but
if
there
be
nothing
after
death
still
during
the
short
time
that
remains
i
shall
not
distress
my
friends
with
lamentations
and
my
ignorance
will
not
last
but
will
die
with
me
and
therefore
no
harm
will
be
done
this
is
the
state
of
mind
simmias
and
cebes
in
which
i
approach
the
argument
and
i
would
ask
you
to
be
thinking
of
the
truth
and
not
of
socrates
agree
with
me
if
i
seem
to
you
to
be
speaking
the
truth
or
if
not
withstand
me
might
and
main
that
i
may
not
deceive
you
as
well
as
myself
in
my
enthusiasm
and
like
the
bee
leave
my
sting
in
you
before
i
die
and
now
let
us
proceed
he
said
and
first
of
all
let
me
be
sure
that
i
have
in
my
mind
what
you
were
saying
simmias
if
i
remember
rightly
has
fears
and
misgivings
whether
the
soul
although
a
fairer
and
diviner
thing
than
the
body
being
as
she
is
in
the
form
of
harmony
may
not
perish
first
on
the
other
hand
cebes
appeared
to
grant
that
the
soul
was
more
lasting
than
the
body
but
he
said
that
no
one
could
know
whether
the
soul
after
having
worn
out
many
bodies
might
not
perish
herself
and
leave
her
last
body
behind
her
and
that
this
is
death
which
is
the
destruction
not
of
the
body
but
of
the
soul
for
in
the
body
the
work
of
destruction
is
ever
going
on
are
not
these
simmias
and
cebes
the
points
which
we
have
to
consider
they
both
agreed
to
this
statement
of
them
he
proceeded
and
did
you
deny
the
force
of
the
whole
preceding
argument
or
of
a
part
only
of
a
part
only
they
replied
and
what
did
you
think
he
said
of
that
part
of
the
argument
in
which
we
said
that
knowledge
was
recollection
and
hence
inferred
that
the
soul
must
have
previously
existed
somewhere
else
before
she
was
enclosed
in
the
body
cebes
said
that
he
had
been
wonderfully
impressed
by
that
part
of
the
argument
and
that
his
conviction
remained
absolutely
unshaken
simmias
agreed
and
added
that
he
himself
could
hardly
imagine
the
possibility
of
his
ever
thinking
differently
but
rejoined
socrates
you
will
have
to
think
differently
my
theban
friend
if
you
still
maintain
that
harmony
is
a
compound
and
that
the
soul
is
a
harmony
which
is
made
out
of
strings
set
in
the
frame
of
the
body
for
you
will
surely
never
allow
yourself
to
say
that
a
harmony
is
prior
to
the
elements
which
compose
it
never
socrates
but
do
you
not
see
that
this
is
what
you
imply
when
you
say
that
the
soul
existed
before
she
took
the
form
and
body
of
man
and
was
made
up
of
elements
which
as
yet
had
no
existence
for
harmony
is
not
like
the
soul
as
you
suppose
but
first
the
lyre
and
the
strings
and
the
sounds
exist
in
a
state
of
discord
and
then
harmony
is
made
last
of
all
and
perishes
first
and
how
can
such
a
notion
of
the
soul
as
this
agree
with
the
other
not
at
all
replied
simmias
and
yet
he
said
there
surely
ought
to
be
harmony
in
a
discourse
of
which
harmony
is
the
theme
there
ought
replied
simmias
but
there
is
no
harmony
he
said
in
the
two
propositions
that
knowledge
is
recollection
and
that
the
soul
is
a
harmony
which
of
them
will
you
retain
i
think
he
replied
that
i
have
a
much
stronger
faith
socrates
in
the
first
of
the
two
which
has
been
fully
demonstrated
to
me
than
in
the
latter
which
has
not
been
demonstrated
at
all
but
rests
only
on
probable
and
plausible
grounds
and
is
therefore
believed
by
the
many
i
know
too
well
that
these
arguments
from
probabilities
are
impostors
and
unless
great
caution
is
observed
in
the
use
of
them
they
are
apt
to
be
deceptive
in
geometry
and
in
other
things
too
but
the
doctrine
of
knowledge
and
recollection
has
been
proven
to
me
on
trustworthy
grounds
and
the
proof
was
that
the
soul
must
have
existed
before
she
came
into
the
body
because
to
her
belongs
the
essence
of
which
the
very
name
implies
existence
having
as
i
am
convinced
rightly
accepted
this
conclusion
and
on
sufficient
grounds
i
must
as
i
suppose
cease
to
argue
or
allow
others
to
argue
that
the
soul
is
a
harmony
let
me
put
the
matter
simmias
he
said
in
another
point
of
view
do
you
imagine
that
a
harmony
or
any
other
composition
can
be
in
a
state
other
than
that
of
the
elements
out
of
which
it
is
compounded
certainly
not
or
do
or
suffer
anything
other
than
they
do
or
suffer
he
agreed
then
a
harmony
does
not
properly
speaking
lead
the
parts
or
elements
which
make
up
the
harmony
but
only
follows
them
he
assented
for
harmony
can
not
possibly
have
any
motion
or
sound
or
other
quality
which
is
opposed
to
its
parts
that
would
be
impossible
he
replied
and
does
not
the
nature
of
every
harmony
depend
upon
the
manner
in
which
the
elements
are
harmonized
i
do
not
understand
you
he
said
i
mean
to
say
that
a
harmony
admits
of
degrees
and
is
more
of
a
harmony
and
more
completely
a
harmony
when
more
truly
and
fully
harmonized
to
any
extent
which
is
possible
and
less
of
a
harmony
and
less
completely
a
harmony
when
less
truly
and
fully
harmonized
true
but
does
the
soul
admit
of
degrees
or
is
one
soul
in
the
very
least
degree
more
or
less
or
more
or
less
completely
a
soul
than
another
not
in
the
least
yet
surely
of
two
souls
one
is
said
to
have
intelligence
and
virtue
and
to
be
good
and
the
other
to
have
folly
and
vice
and
to
be
an
evil
soul
and
this
is
said
truly
yes
truly
but
what
will
those
who
maintain
the
soul
to
be
a
harmony
say
of
this
presence
of
virtue
and
vice
in
the
soul
will
they
say
that
here
is
another
harmony
and
another
discord
and
that
the
virtuous
soul
is
harmonized
and
herself
being
a
harmony
has
another
harmony
within
her
and
that
the
vicious
soul
is
inharmonical
and
has
no
harmony
within
her
i
can
not
tell
replied
simmias
but
i
suppose
that
something
of
the
sort
would
be
asserted
by
those
who
say
that
the
soul
is
a
harmony
and
we
have
already
admitted
that
no
soul
is
more
a
soul
than
another
which
is
equivalent
to
admitting
that
harmony
is
not
more
or
less
harmony
or
more
or
less
completely
a
harmony
quite
true
and
that
which
is
not
more
or
less
a
harmony
is
not
more
or
less
harmonized
true
and
that
which
is
not
more
or
less
harmonized
can
not
have
more
or
less
of
harmony
but
only
an
equal
harmony
yes
an
equal
harmony
then
one
soul
not
being
more
or
less
absolutely
a
soul
than
another
is
not
more
or
less
harmonized
exactly
and
therefore
has
neither
more
nor
less
of
discord
nor
yet
of
harmony
she
has
not
and
having
neither
more
nor
less
of
harmony
or
of
discord
one
soul
has
no
more
vice
or
virtue
than
another
if
vice
be
discord
and
virtue
harmony
not
at
all
more
or
speaking
more
correctly
simmias
the
soul
if
she
is
a
harmony
will
never
have
any
vice
because
a
harmony
being
absolutely
a
harmony
has
no
part
in
the
inharmonical
no
and
therefore
a
soul
which
is
absolutely
a
soul
has
no
vice
how
can
she
have
if
the
previous
argument
holds
then
if
all
souls
are
equally
by
their
nature
souls
all
souls
of
all
living
creatures
will
be
equally
good
i
agree
with
you
socrates
he
said
and
can
all
this
be
true
think
you
he
said
for
these
are
the
consequences
which
seem
to
follow
from
the
assumption
that
the
soul
is
a
harmony
it
can
not
be
true
once
more
he
said
what
ruler
is
there
of
the
elements
of
human
nature
other
than
the
soul
and
especially
the
wise
soul
do
you
know
of
any
indeed
i
do
not
and
is
the
soul
in
agreement
with
the
affections
of
the
body
or
is
she
at
variance
with
them
for
example
when
the
body
is
hot
and
thirsty
does
not
the
soul
incline
us
against
drinking
and
when
the
body
is
hungry
against
eating
and
this
is
only
one
instance
out
of
ten
thousand
of
the
opposition
of
the
soul
to
the
things
of
the
body
very
true
but
we
have
already
acknowledged
that
the
soul
being
a
harmony
can
never
utter
a
note
at
variance
with
the
tensions
and
relaxations
and
vibrations
and
other
affections
of
the
strings
out
of
which
she
is
composed
she
can
only
follow
she
can
not
lead
them
it
must
be
so
he
replied
and
yet
do
we
not
now
discover
the
soul
to
be
doing
the
exact
opposite
leading
the
elements
of
which
she
is
believed
to
be
composed
almost
always
opposing
and
coercing
them
in
all
sorts
of
ways
throughout
life
sometimes
more
violently
with
the
pains
of
medicine
and
gymnastic
then
again
more
gently
now
threatening
now
admonishing
the
desires
passions
fears
as
if
talking
to
a
thing
which
is
not
herself
as
homer
in
the
odyssee
represents
odysseus
doing
in
the
words
beat
his
breast
and
thus
reproached
his
heart
endure
my
heart
far
worse
hast
thou
endured
do
you
think
that
homer
wrote
this
under
the
idea
that
the
soul
is
a
harmony
capable
of
being
led
by
the
affections
of
the
body
and
not
rather
of
a
nature
which
should
lead
and
master
them
herself
a
far
diviner
thing
than
any
harmony
yes
socrates
i
quite
think
so
then
my
friend
we
can
never
be
right
in
saying
that
the
soul
is
a
harmony
for
we
should
contradict
the
divine
homer
and
contradict
ourselves
true
he
said
thus
much
said
socrates
of
harmonia
your
theban
goddess
who
has
graciously
yielded
to
us
but
what
shall
i
say
cebes
to
her
husband
cadmus
and
how
shall
i
make
peace
with
him
i
think
that
you
will
discover
a
way
of
propitiating
him
said
cebes
i
am
sure
that
you
have
put
the
argument
with
harmonia
in
a
manner
that
i
could
never
have
expected
for
when
simmias
was
mentioning
his
difficulty
i
quite
imagined
that
no
answer
could
be
given
to
him
and
therefore
i
was
surprised
at
finding
that
his
argument
could
not
sustain
the
first
onset
of
yours
and
not
impossibly
the
other
whom
you
call
cadmus
may
share
a
similar
fate
nay
my
good
friend
said
socrates
let
us
not
boast
lest
some
evil
eye
should
put
to
flight
the
word
which
i
am
about
to
speak
that
however
may
be
left
in
the
hands
of
those
above
while
i
draw
near
in
homeric
fashion
and
try
the
mettle
of
your
words
here
lies
the
point
you
want
to
have
it
proven
to
you
that
the
soul
is
imperishable
and
immortal
and
the
philosopher
who
is
confident
in
death
appears
to
you
to
have
but
a
vain
and
foolish
confidence
if
he
believes
that
he
will
fare
better
in
the
world
below
than
one
who
has
led
another
sort
of
life
unless
he
can
prove
this
and
you
say
that
the
demonstration
of
the
strength
and
divinity
of
the
soul
and
of
her
existence
prior
to
our
becoming
men
does
not
necessarily
imply
her
immortality
admitting
the
soul
to
be
longlived
and
to
have
known
and
done
much
in
a
former
state
still
she
is
not
on
that
account
immortal
and
her
entrance
into
the
human
form
may
be
a
sort
of
disease
which
is
the
beginning
of
dissolution
and
may
at
last
after
the
toils
of
life
are
over
end
in
that
which
is
called
death
and
whether
the
soul
enters
into
the
body
once
only
or
many
times
does
not
as
you
say
make
any
difference
in
the
fears
of
individuals
for
any
man
who
is
not
devoid
of
sense
must
fear
if
he
has
no
knowledge
and
can
give
no
account
of
the
immortality
this
or
something
like
this
i
suspect
to
be
your
notion
cebes
and
i
designedly
recur
to
it
in
order
that
nothing
may
escape
us
and
that
you
may
if
you
wish
add
or
subtract
anything
but
said
cebes
as
far
as
i
see
at
present
i
have
nothing
to
add
or
subtract
i
mean
what
you
say
that
i
mean
socrates
paused
awhile
and
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
reflection
at
length
he
said
you
are
raising
a
tremendous
question
cebes
involving
the
whole
nature
of
generation
and
corruption
about
which
if
you
like
i
will
give
you
my
own
experience
and
if
anything
which
i
say
is
likely
to
avail
towards
the
solution
of
your
difficulty
you
may
make
use
of
it
i
should
very
much
like
said
cebes
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
then
i
will
tell
you
said
socrates
when
i
was
young
cebes
i
had
a
prodigious
desire
to
know
that
department
of
philosophy
which
is
called
the
investigation
of
nature
to
know
the
causes
of
things
and
why
a
thing
is
and
is
created
or
destroyed
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
lofty
profession
and
i
was
always
agitating
myself
with
the
consideration
of
questions
such
as
these
is
the
growth
of
animals
the
result
of
some
decay
which
the
hot
and
cold
principle
contracts
as
some
have
said
is
the
blood
the
element
with
which
we
think
or
the
air
or
the
fire
or
perhaps
nothing
of
the
kind
but
the
brain
may
be
the
originating
power
of
the
perceptions
of
hearing
and
sight
and
smell
and
memory
and
opinion
may
come
from
them
and
science
may
be
based
on
memory
and
opinion
when
they
have
attained
fixity
and
then
i
went
on
to
examine
the
corruption
of
them
and
then
to
the
things
of
heaven
and
earth
and
at
last
i
concluded
myself
to
be
utterly
and
absolutely
incapable
of
these
enquiries
as
i
will
satisfactorily
prove
to
you
for
i
was
fascinated
by
them
to
such
a
degree
that
my
eyes
grew
blind
to
things
which
i
had
seemed
to
myself
and
also
to
others
to
know
quite
well
i
forgot
what
i
had
before
thought
truths
such
a
fact
as
that
the
growth
of
man
is
the
result
of
eating
and
drinking
for
when
by
the
digestion
of
food
flesh
is
added
to
flesh
and
bone
to
bone
and
whenever
there
is
an
aggregation
of
congenial
elements
the
lesser
bulk
becomes
larger
and
the
small
man
great
was
not
that
a
reasonable
notion
yes
said
cebes
i
think
so
well
but
let
me
tell
you
something
more
there
was
a
time
when
i
thought
that
i
understood
the
meaning
of
greater
and
less
pretty
well
and
when
i
saw
a
great
man
standing
by
a
little
one
i
fancied
that
one
was
taller
than
the
other
by
a
head
or
one
horse
would
appear
to
be
greater
than
another
horse
and
still
more
clearly
did
i
seem
to
perceive
that
ten
is
two
more
than
eight
and
that
two
cubits
are
more
than
one
because
two
is
the
double
of
one
and
what
is
now
your
notion
of
such
matters
said
cebes
i
should
be
far
enough
from
imagining
he
replied
that
i
knew
the
cause
of
any
of
them
by
heaven
i
should
for
i
can
not
satisfy
myself
that
when
one
is
added
to
one
the
one
to
which
the
addition
is
made
becomes
two
or
that
the
two
units
added
together
make
two
by
reason
of
the
addition
i
can
not
understand
how
when
separated
from
the
other
each
of
them
was
one
and
not
two
and
now
when
they
are
brought
together
the
mere
juxtaposition
or
meeting
of
them
should
be
the
cause
of
their
becoming
two
neither
can
i
understand
how
the
division
of
one
is
the
way
to
make
two
for
then
a
different
cause
would
produce
the
same
effect
as
in
the
former
instance
the
addition
and
juxtaposition
of
one
to
one
was
the
cause
of
two
in
this
the
separation
and
subtraction
of
one
from
the
other
would
be
the
cause
nor
am
i
any
longer
satisfied
that
i
understand
the
reason
why
one
or
anything
else
is
either
generated
or
destroyed
or
is
at
all
but
i
have
in
my
mind
some
confused
notion
of
a
new
method
and
can
never
admit
the
other
then
i
heard
some
one
reading
as
he
said
from
a
book
of
anaxagoras
that
mind
was
the
disposer
and
cause
of
all
and
i
was
delighted
at
this
notion
which
appeared
quite
admirable
and
i
said
to
myself
if
mind
is
the
disposer
mind
will
dispose
all
for
the
best
and
put
each
particular
in
the
best
place
and
i
argued
that
if
any
one
desired
to
find
out
the
cause
of
the
generation
or
destruction
or
existence
of
anything
he
must
find
out
what
state
of
being
or
doing
or
suffering
was
best
for
that
thing
and
therefore
a
man
had
only
to
consider
the
best
for
himself
and
others
and
then
he
would
also
know
the
worse
since
the
same
science
comprehended
both
and
i
rejoiced
to
think
that
i
had
found
in
anaxagoras
a
teacher
of
the
causes
of
existence
such
as
i
desired
and
i
imagined
that
he
would
tell
me
first
whether
the
earth
is
flat
or
round
and
whichever
was
true
he
would
proceed
to
explain
the
cause
and
the
necessity
of
this
being
so
and
then
he
would
teach
me
the
nature
of
the
best
and
show
that
this
was
best
and
if
he
said
that
the
earth
was
in
the
centre
he
would
further
explain
that
this
position
was
the
best
and
i
should
be
satisfied
with
the
explanation
given
and
not
want
any
other
sort
of
cause
and
i
thought
that
i
would
then
go
on
and
ask
him
about
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
and
that
he
would
explain
to
me
their
comparative
swiftness
and
their
returnings
and
various
states
active
and
passive
and
how
all
of
them
were
for
the
best
for
i
could
not
imagine
that
when
he
spoke
of
mind
as
the
disposer
of
them
he
would
give
any
other
account
of
their
being
as
they
are
except
that
this
was
best
and
i
thought
that
when
he
had
explained
to
me
in
detail
the
cause
of
each
and
the
cause
of
all
he
would
go
on
to
explain
to
me
what
was
best
for
each
and
what
was
good
for
all
these
hopes
i
would
not
have
sold
for
a
large
sum
of
money
and
i
seized
the
books
and
read
them
as
fast
as
i
could
in
my
eagerness
to
know
the
better
and
the
worse
what
expectations
i
had
formed
and
how
grievously
was
i
disappointed
as
i
proceeded
i
found
my
philosopher
altogether
forsaking
mind
or
any
other
principle
of
order
but
having
recourse
to
air
and
ether
and
water
and
other
eccentricities
i
might
compare
him
to
a
person
who
began
by
maintaining
generally
that
mind
is
the
cause
of
the
actions
of
socrates
but
who
when
he
endeavoured
to
explain
the
causes
of
my
several
actions
in
detail
went
on
to
show
that
i
sit
here
because
my
body
is
made
up
of
bones
and
muscles
and
the
bones
as
he
would
say
are
hard
and
have
joints
which
divide
them
and
the
muscles
are
elastic
and
they
cover
the
bones
which
have
also
a
covering
or
environment
of
flesh
and
skin
which
contains
them
and
as
the
bones
are
lifted
at
their
joints
by
the
contraction
or
relaxation
of
the
muscles
i
am
able
to
bend
my
limbs
and
this
is
why
i
am
sitting
here
in
a
curved
posture
that
is
what
he
would
say
and
he
would
have
a
similar
explanation
of
my
talking
to
you
which
he
would
attribute
to
sound
and
air
and
hearing
and
he
would
assign
ten
thousand
other
causes
of
the
same
sort
forgetting
to
mention
the
true
cause
which
is
that
the
athenians
have
thought
fit
to
condemn
me
and
accordingly
i
have
thought
it
better
and
more
right
to
remain
here
and
undergo
my
sentence
for
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
these
muscles
and
bones
of
mine
would
have
gone
off
long
ago
to
megara
or
boeotia
by
the
dog
they
would
if
they
had
been
moved
only
by
their
own
idea
of
what
was
best
and
if
i
had
not
chosen
the
better
and
nobler
part
instead
of
playing
truant
and
running
away
of
enduring
any
punishment
which
the
state
inflicts
there
is
surely
a
strange
confusion
of
causes
and
conditions
in
all
this
it
may
be
said
indeed
that
without
bones
and
muscles
and
the
other
parts
of
the
body
i
can
not
execute
my
purposes
but
to
say
that
i
do
as
i
do
because
of
them
and
that
this
is
the
way
in
which
mind
acts
and
not
from
the
choice
of
the
best
is
a
very
careless
and
idle
mode
of
speaking
i
wonder
that
they
can
not
distinguish
the
cause
from
the
condition
which
the
many
feeling
about
in
the
dark
are
always
mistaking
and
misnaming
and
thus
one
man
makes
a
vortex
all
round
and
steadies
the
earth
by
the
heaven
another
gives
the
air
as
a
support
to
the
earth
which
is
a
sort
of
broad
trough
any
power
which
in
arranging
them
as
they
are
arranges
them
for
the
best
never
enters
into
their
minds
and
instead
of
finding
any
superior
strength
in
it
they
rather
expect
to
discover
another
atlas
of
the
world
who
is
stronger
and
more
everlasting
and
more
containing
than
the
good
of
the
obligatory
and
containing
power
of
the
good
they
think
nothing
and
yet
this
is
the
principle
which
i
would
fain
learn
if
any
one
would
teach
me
but
as
i
have
failed
either
to
discover
myself
or
to
learn
of
any
one
else
the
nature
of
the
best
i
will
exhibit
to
you
if
you
like
what
i
have
found
to
be
the
second
best
mode
of
enquiring
into
the
cause
i
should
very
much
like
to
hear
he
replied
socrates
proceeded
i
thought
that
as
i
had
failed
in
the
contemplation
of
true
existence
i
ought
to
be
careful
that
i
did
not
lose
the
eye
of
my
soul
as
people
may
injure
their
bodily
eye
by
observing
and
gazing
on
the
sun
during
an
eclipse
unless
they
take
the
precaution
of
only
looking
at
the
image
reflected
in
the
water
or
in
some
similar
medium
so
in
my
own
case
i
was
afraid
that
my
soul
might
be
blinded
altogether
if
i
looked
at
things
with
my
eyes
or
tried
to
apprehend
them
by
the
help
of
the
senses
and
i
thought
that
i
had
better
have
recourse
to
the
world
of
mind
and
seek
there
the
truth
of
existence
i
dare
say
that
the
simile
is
not
perfect
for
i
am
very
far
from
admitting
that
he
who
contemplates
existences
through
the
medium
of
thought
sees
them
only
a
glass
darkly
any
more
than
he
who
considers
them
in
action
and
operation
however
this
was
the
method
which
i
adopted
i
first
assumed
some
principle
which
i
judged
to
be
the
strongest
and
then
i
affirmed
as
true
whatever
seemed
to
agree
with
this
whether
relating
to
the
cause
or
to
anything
else
and
that
which
disagreed
i
regarded
as
untrue
but
i
should
like
to
explain
my
meaning
more
clearly
as
i
do
not
think
that
you
as
yet
understand
me
no
indeed
replied
cebes
not
very
well
there
is
nothing
new
he
said
in
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you
but
only
what
i
have
been
always
and
everywhere
repeating
in
the
previous
discussion
and
on
other
occasions
i
want
to
show
you
the
nature
of
that
cause
which
has
occupied
my
thoughts
i
shall
have
to
go
back
to
those
familiar
words
which
are
in
the
mouth
of
every
one
and
first
of
all
assume
that
there
is
an
absolute
beauty
and
goodness
and
greatness
and
the
like
grant
me
this
and
i
hope
to
be
able
to
show
you
the
nature
of
the
cause
and
to
prove
the
immortality
of
the
soul
cebes
said
you
may
proceed
at
once
with
the
proof
for
i
grant
you
this
well
he
said
then
i
should
like
to
know
whether
you
agree
with
me
in
the
next
step
for
i
can
not
help
thinking
if
there
be
anything
beautiful
other
than
absolute
beauty
should
there
be
such
that
it
can
be
beautiful
only
in
as
far
as
it
partakes
of
absolute
beauty
and
i
should
say
the
same
of
everything
do
you
agree
in
this
notion
of
the
cause
yes
he
said
i
agree
he
proceeded
i
know
nothing
and
can
understand
nothing
of
any
other
of
those
wise
causes
which
are
alleged
and
if
a
person
says
to
me
that
the
bloom
of
colour
or
form
or
any
such
thing
is
a
source
of
beauty
i
leave
all
that
which
is
only
confusing
to
me
and
simply
and
singly
and
perhaps
foolishly
hold
and
am
assured
in
my
own
mind
that
nothing
makes
a
thing
beautiful
but
the
presence
and
participation
of
beauty
in
whatever
way
or
manner
obtained
for
as
to
the
manner
i
am
uncertain
but
i
stoutly
contend
that
by
beauty
all
beautiful
things
become
beautiful
this
appears
to
me
to
be
the
safest
answer
which
i
can
give
either
to
myself
or
to
another
and
to
this
i
cling
in
the
persuasion
that
this
principle
will
never
be
overthrown
and
that
to
myself
or
to
any
one
who
asks
the
question
i
may
safely
reply
that
by
beauty
beautiful
things
become
beautiful
do
you
not
agree
with
me
i
do
and
that
by
greatness
only
great
things
become
great
and
greater
greater
and
by
smallness
the
less
become
less
true
then
if
a
person
were
to
remark
that
a
is
taller
by
a
head
than
b
and
b
less
by
a
head
than
a
you
would
refuse
to
admit
his
statement
and
would
stoutly
contend
that
what
you
mean
is
only
that
the
greater
is
greater
by
and
by
reason
of
greatness
and
the
less
is
less
only
by
and
by
reason
of
smallness
and
thus
you
would
avoid
the
danger
of
saying
that
the
greater
is
greater
and
the
less
less
by
the
measure
of
the
head
which
is
the
same
in
both
and
would
also
avoid
the
monstrous
absurdity
of
supposing
that
the
greater
man
is
greater
by
reason
of
the
head
which
is
small
you
would
be
afraid
to
draw
such
an
inference
would
you
not
indeed
i
should
said
cebes
laughing
in
like
manner
you
would
be
afraid
to
say
that
ten
exceeded
eight
by
and
by
reason
of
two
but
would
say
by
and
by
reason
of
number
or
you
would
say
that
two
cubits
exceed
one
cubit
not
by
a
half
but
by
magnitude
there
is
the
same
liability
to
error
in
all
these
cases
very
true
he
said
again
would
you
not
be
cautious
of
affirming
that
the
addition
of
one
to
one
or
the
division
of
one
is
the
cause
of
two
and
you
would
loudly
asseverate
that
you
know
of
no
way
in
which
anything
comes
into
existence
except
by
participation
in
its
own
proper
essence
and
consequently
as
far
as
you
know
the
only
cause
of
two
is
the
participation
in
duality
this
is
the
way
to
make
two
and
the
participation
in
one
is
the
way
to
make
one
you
would
say
i
will
let
alone
puzzles
of
division
and
addition
wiser
heads
than
mine
may
answer
them
inexperienced
as
i
am
and
ready
to
start
as
the
proverb
says
at
my
own
shadow
i
can
not
afford
to
give
up
the
sure
ground
of
a
principle
and
if
any
one
assails
you
there
you
would
not
mind
him
or
answer
him
until
you
had
seen
whether
the
consequences
which
follow
agree
with
one
another
or
not
and
when
you
are
further
required
to
give
an
explanation
of
this
principle
you
would
go
on
to
assume
a
higher
principle
and
a
higher
until
you
found
a
in
the
best
of
the
higher
but
you
would
not
confuse
the
principle
and
the
consequences
in
your
reasoning
like
the
eristics
at
least
if
you
wanted
to
discover
real
existence
not
that
this
confusion
signifies
to
them
who
never
care
or
think
about
the
matter
at
all
for
they
have
the
wit
to
be
well
pleased
with
themselves
however
great
may
be
the
turmoil
of
their
ideas
but
you
if
you
are
a
philosopher
will
certainly
do
as
i
say
what
you
say
is
most
true
said
simmias
and
cebes
both
speaking
at
once
echecrates
yes
phaedo
and
i
do
not
wonder
at
their
assenting
any
one
who
has
the
least
sense
will
acknowledge
the
wonderful
clearness
of
socrates
reasoning
phaedo
certainly
echecrates
and
such
was
the
feeling
of
the
whole
company
at
the
time
echecrates
yes
and
equally
of
ourselves
who
were
not
of
the
company
and
are
now
listening
to
your
recital
but
what
followed
phaedo
after
all
this
had
been
admitted
and
they
had
that
ideas
exist
and
that
other
things
participate
in
them
and
derive
their
names
from
them
socrates
if
i
remember
rightly
said
this
is
your
way
of
speaking
and
yet
when
you
say
that
simmias
is
greater
than
socrates
and
less
than
phaedo
do
you
not
predicate
of
simmias
both
greatness
and
smallness
yes
i
do
but
still
you
allow
that
simmias
does
not
really
exceed
socrates
as
the
words
may
seem
to
imply
because
he
is
simmias
but
by
reason
of
the
size
which
he
has
just
as
simmias
does
not
exceed
socrates
because
he
is
simmias
any
more
than
because
socrates
is
socrates
but
because
he
has
smallness
when
compared
with
the
greatness
of
simmias
true
and
if
phaedo
exceeds
him
in
size
this
is
not
because
phaedo
is
phaedo
but
because
phaedo
has
greatness
relatively
to
simmias
who
is
comparatively
smaller
that
is
true
and
therefore
simmias
is
said
to
be
great
and
is
also
said
to
be
small
because
he
is
in
a
mean
between
them
exceeding
the
smallness
of
the
one
by
his
greatness
and
allowing
the
greatness
of
the
other
to
exceed
his
smallness
he
added
laughing
i
am
speaking
like
a
book
but
i
believe
that
what
i
am
saying
is
true
simmias
assented
i
speak
as
i
do
because
i
want
you
to
agree
with
me
in
thinking
not
only
that
absolute
greatness
will
never
be
great
and
also
small
but
that
greatness
in
us
or
in
the
concrete
will
never
admit
the
small
or
admit
of
being
exceeded
instead
of
this
one
of
two
things
will
happen
either
the
greater
will
fly
or
retire
before
the
opposite
which
is
the
less
or
at
the
approach
of
the
less
has
already
ceased
to
exist
but
will
not
if
allowing
or
admitting
of
smallness
be
changed
by
that
even
as
i
having
received
and
admitted
smallness
when
compared
with
simmias
remain
just
as
i
was
and
am
the
same
small
person
and
as
the
idea
of
greatness
can
not
condescend
ever
to
be
or
become
small
in
like
manner
the
smallness
in
us
can
not
be
or
become
great
nor
can
any
other
opposite
which
remains
the
same
ever
be
or
become
its
own
opposite
but
either
passes
away
or
perishes
in
the
change
that
replied
cebes
is
quite
my
notion
hereupon
one
of
the
company
though
i
do
not
exactly
remember
which
of
them
said
in
heaven
name
is
not
this
the
direct
contrary
of
what
was
admitted
before
that
out
of
the
greater
came
the
less
and
out
of
the
less
the
greater
and
that
opposites
were
simply
generated
from
opposites
but
now
this
principle
seems
to
be
utterly
denied
socrates
inclined
his
head
to
the
speaker
and
listened
i
like
your
courage
he
said
in
reminding
us
of
this
but
you
do
not
observe
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
two
cases
for
then
we
were
speaking
of
opposites
in
the
concrete
and
now
of
the
essential
opposite
which
as
is
affirmed
neither
in
us
nor
in
nature
can
ever
be
at
variance
with
itself
then
my
friend
we
were
speaking
of
things
in
which
opposites
are
inherent
and
which
are
called
after
them
but
now
about
the
opposites
which
are
inherent
in
them
and
which
give
their
name
to
them
and
these
essential
opposites
will
never
as
we
maintain
admit
of
generation
into
or
out
of
one
another
at
the
same
time
turning
to
cebes
he
said
are
you
at
all
disconcerted
cebes
at
our
objection
no
i
do
not
feel
so
said
cebes
and
yet
i
can
not
deny
that
i
am
often
disturbed
by
objections
then
we
are
agreed
after
all
said
socrates
that
the
opposite
will
never
in
any
case
be
opposed
to
itself
to
that
we
are
quite
agreed
he
replied
yet
once
more
let
me
ask
you
to
consider
the
question
from
another
point
of
view
and
see
whether
you
agree
with
me
there
is
a
thing
which
you
term
heat
and
another
thing
which
you
term
cold
certainly
but
are
they
the
same
as
fire
and
snow
most
assuredly
not
heat
is
a
thing
different
from
fire
and
cold
is
not
the
same
with
snow
yes
and
yet
you
will
surely
admit
that
when
snow
as
was
before
said
is
under
the
influence
of
heat
they
will
not
remain
snow
and
heat
but
at
the
advance
of
the
heat
the
snow
will
either
retire
or
perish
very
true
he
replied
and
the
fire
too
at
the
advance
of
the
cold
will
either
retire
or
perish
and
when
the
fire
is
under
the
influence
of
the
cold
they
will
not
remain
as
before
fire
and
cold
that
is
true
he
said
and
in
some
cases
the
name
of
the
idea
is
not
only
attached
to
the
idea
in
an
eternal
connection
but
anything
else
which
not
being
the
idea
exists
only
in
the
form
of
the
idea
may
also
lay
claim
to
it
i
will
try
to
make
this
clearer
by
an
example
the
odd
number
is
always
called
by
the
name
of
odd
very
true
but
is
this
the
only
thing
which
is
called
odd
are
there
not
other
things
which
have
their
own
name
and
yet
are
called
odd
because
although
not
the
same
as
oddness
they
are
never
without
oddness
that
is
what
i
mean
to
ask
whether
numbers
such
as
the
number
three
are
not
of
the
class
of
odd
and
there
are
many
other
examples
would
you
not
say
for
example
that
three
may
be
called
by
its
proper
name
and
also
be
called
odd
which
is
not
the
same
with
three
and
this
may
be
said
not
only
of
three
but
also
of
five
and
of
every
alternate
number
each
of
them
without
being
oddness
is
odd
and
in
the
same
way
two
and
four
and
the
other
series
of
alternate
numbers
has
every
number
even
without
being
evenness
do
you
agree
of
course
then
now
mark
the
point
at
which
i
am
aiming
not
only
do
essential
opposites
exclude
one
another
but
also
concrete
things
which
although
not
in
themselves
opposed
contain
opposites
these
i
say
likewise
reject
the
idea
which
is
opposed
to
that
which
is
contained
in
them
and
when
it
approaches
them
they
either
perish
or
withdraw
for
example
will
not
the
number
three
endure
annihilation
or
anything
sooner
than
be
converted
into
an
even
number
while
remaining
three
very
true
said
cebes
and
yet
he
said
the
number
two
is
certainly
not
opposed
to
the
number
three
it
is
not
then
not
only
do
opposite
ideas
repel
the
advance
of
one
another
but
also
there
are
other
natures
which
repel
the
approach
of
opposites
very
true
he
said
suppose
he
said
that
we
endeavour
if
possible
to
determine
what
these
are
by
all
means
are
they
not
cebes
such
as
compel
the
things
of
which
they
have
possession
not
only
to
take
their
own
form
but
also
the
form
of
some
opposite
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
as
i
was
just
now
saying
and
as
i
am
sure
that
you
know
that
those
things
which
are
possessed
by
the
number
three
must
not
only
be
three
in
number
but
must
also
be
odd
quite
true
and
on
this
oddness
of
which
the
number
three
has
the
impress
the
opposite
idea
will
never
intrude
no
and
this
impress
was
given
by
the
odd
principle
yes
and
to
the
odd
is
opposed
the
even
true
then
the
idea
of
the
even
number
will
never
arrive
at
three
no
then
three
has
no
part
in
the
even
none
then
the
triad
or
number
three
is
uneven
very
true
to
return
then
to
my
distinction
of
natures
which
are
not
opposed
and
yet
do
not
admit
opposites
as
in
the
instance
given
three
although
not
opposed
to
the
even
does
not
any
the
more
admit
of
the
even
but
always
brings
the
opposite
into
play
on
the
other
side
or
as
two
does
not
receive
the
odd
or
fire
the
cold
from
these
examples
and
there
are
many
more
of
them
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
arrive
at
the
general
conclusion
that
not
only
opposites
will
not
receive
opposites
but
also
that
nothing
which
brings
the
opposite
will
admit
the
opposite
of
that
which
it
brings
in
that
to
which
it
is
brought
and
here
let
me
recapitulate
for
there
is
no
harm
in
repetition
the
number
five
will
not
admit
the
nature
of
the
even
any
more
than
ten
which
is
the
double
of
five
will
admit
the
nature
of
the
odd
the
double
has
another
opposite
and
is
not
strictly
opposed
to
the
odd
but
nevertheless
rejects
the
odd
altogether
nor
again
will
parts
in
the
ratio
nor
any
fraction
in
which
there
is
a
half
nor
again
in
which
there
is
a
third
admit
the
notion
of
the
whole
although
they
are
not
opposed
to
the
whole
you
will
agree
yes
he
said
i
entirely
agree
and
go
along
with
you
in
that
and
now
he
said
let
us
begin
again
and
do
not
you
answer
my
question
in
the
words
in
which
i
ask
it
let
me
have
not
the
old
safe
answer
of
which
i
spoke
at
first
but
another
equally
safe
of
which
the
truth
will
be
inferred
by
you
from
what
has
been
just
said
i
mean
that
if
any
one
asks
you
that
is
of
which
the
inherence
makes
the
body
hot
you
will
reply
not
heat
this
is
what
i
call
the
safe
and
stupid
answer
but
fire
a
far
superior
answer
which
we
are
now
in
a
condition
to
give
or
if
any
one
asks
you
a
body
is
diseased
you
will
not
say
from
disease
but
from
fever
and
instead
of
saying
that
oddness
is
the
cause
of
odd
numbers
you
will
say
that
the
monad
is
the
cause
of
them
and
so
of
things
in
general
as
i
dare
say
that
you
will
understand
sufficiently
without
my
adducing
any
further
examples
yes
he
said
i
quite
understand
you
tell
me
then
what
is
that
of
which
the
inherence
will
render
the
body
alive
the
soul
he
replied
and
is
this
always
the
case
yes
he
said
of
course
then
whatever
the
soul
possesses
to
that
she
comes
bearing
life
yes
certainly
and
is
there
any
opposite
to
life
there
is
he
said
and
what
is
that
death
then
the
soul
as
has
been
acknowledged
will
never
receive
the
opposite
of
what
she
brings
impossible
replied
cebes
and
now
he
said
what
did
we
just
now
call
that
principle
which
repels
the
even
the
odd
and
that
principle
which
repels
the
musical
or
the
just
the
unmusical
he
said
and
the
unjust
and
what
do
we
call
the
principle
which
does
not
admit
of
death
the
immortal
he
said
and
does
the
soul
admit
of
death
no
then
the
soul
is
immortal
yes
he
said
and
may
we
say
that
this
has
been
proven
yes
abundantly
proven
socrates
he
replied
supposing
that
the
odd
were
imperishable
must
not
three
be
imperishable
of
course
and
if
that
which
is
cold
were
imperishable
when
the
warm
principle
came
attacking
the
snow
must
not
the
snow
have
retired
whole
and
unmelted
for
it
could
never
have
perished
nor
could
it
have
remained
and
admitted
the
heat
true
he
said
again
if
the
uncooling
or
warm
principle
were
imperishable
the
fire
when
assailed
by
cold
would
not
have
perished
or
have
been
extinguished
but
would
have
gone
away
unaffected
certainly
he
said
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
immortal
if
the
immortal
is
also
imperishable
the
soul
when
attacked
by
death
can
not
perish
for
the
preceding
argument
shows
that
the
soul
will
not
admit
of
death
or
ever
be
dead
any
more
than
three
or
the
odd
number
will
admit
of
the
even
or
fire
or
the
heat
in
the
fire
of
the
cold
yet
a
person
may
say
although
the
odd
will
not
become
even
at
the
approach
of
the
even
why
may
not
the
odd
perish
and
the
even
take
the
place
of
the
odd
now
to
him
who
makes
this
objection
we
can
not
answer
that
the
odd
principle
is
imperishable
for
this
has
not
been
acknowledged
but
if
this
had
been
acknowledged
there
would
have
been
no
difficulty
in
contending
that
at
the
approach
of
the
even
the
odd
principle
and
the
number
three
took
their
departure
and
the
same
argument
would
have
held
good
of
fire
and
heat
and
any
other
thing
very
true
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
immortal
if
the
immortal
is
also
imperishable
then
the
soul
will
be
imperishable
as
well
as
immortal
but
if
not
some
other
proof
of
her
imperishableness
will
have
to
be
given
no
other
proof
is
needed
he
said
for
if
the
immortal
being
eternal
is
liable
to
perish
then
nothing
is
imperishable
yes
replied
socrates
and
yet
all
men
will
agree
that
god
and
the
essential
form
of
life
and
the
immortal
in
general
will
never
perish
yes
all
men
he
said
that
is
true
and
what
is
more
gods
if
i
am
not
mistaken
as
well
as
men
seeing
then
that
the
immortal
is
indestructible
must
not
the
soul
if
she
is
immortal
be
also
imperishable
most
certainly
then
when
death
attacks
a
man
the
mortal
portion
of
him
may
be
supposed
to
die
but
the
immortal
retires
at
the
approach
of
death
and
is
preserved
safe
and
sound
true
then
cebes
beyond
question
the
soul
is
immortal
and
imperishable
and
our
souls
will
truly
exist
in
another
world
i
am
convinced
socrates
said
cebes
and
have
nothing
more
to
object
but
if
my
friend
simmias
or
any
one
else
has
any
further
objection
to
make
he
had
better
speak
out
and
not
keep
silence
since
i
do
not
know
to
what
other
season
he
can
defer
the
discussion
if
there
is
anything
which
he
wants
to
say
or
to
have
said
but
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
replied
simmias
nor
can
i
see
any
reason
for
doubt
after
what
has
been
said
but
i
still
feel
and
can
not
help
feeling
uncertain
in
my
own
mind
when
i
think
of
the
greatness
of
the
subject
and
the
feebleness
of
man
yes
simmias
replied
socrates
that
is
well
said
and
i
may
add
that
first
principles
even
if
they
appear
certain
should
be
carefully
considered
and
when
they
are
satisfactorily
ascertained
then
with
a
sort
of
hesitating
confidence
in
human
reason
you
may
i
think
follow
the
course
of
the
argument
and
if
that
be
plain
and
clear
there
will
be
no
need
for
any
further
enquiry
very
true
but
then
o
my
friends
he
said
if
the
soul
is
really
immortal
what
care
should
be
taken
of
her
not
only
in
respect
of
the
portion
of
time
which
is
called
life
but
of
eternity
and
the
danger
of
neglecting
her
from
this
point
of
view
does
indeed
appear
to
be
awful
if
death
had
only
been
the
end
of
all
the
wicked
would
have
had
a
good
bargain
in
dying
for
they
would
have
been
happily
quit
not
only
of
their
body
but
of
their
own
evil
together
with
their
souls
but
now
inasmuch
as
the
soul
is
manifestly
immortal
there
is
no
release
or
salvation
from
evil
except
the
attainment
of
the
highest
virtue
and
wisdom
for
the
soul
when
on
her
progress
to
the
world
below
takes
nothing
with
her
but
nurture
and
education
and
these
are
said
greatly
to
benefit
or
greatly
to
injure
the
departed
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
journey
thither
for
after
death
as
they
say
the
genius
of
each
individual
to
whom
he
belonged
in
life
leads
him
to
a
certain
place
in
which
the
dead
are
gathered
together
whence
after
judgment
has
been
given
they
pass
into
the
world
below
following
the
guide
who
is
appointed
to
conduct
them
from
this
world
to
the
other
and
when
they
have
there
received
their
due
and
remained
their
time
another
guide
brings
them
back
again
after
many
revolutions
of
ages
now
this
way
to
the
other
world
is
not
as
aeschylus
says
in
the
telephus
a
single
and
straight
path
if
that
were
so
no
guide
would
be
needed
for
no
one
could
miss
it
but
there
are
many
partings
of
the
road
and
windings
as
i
infer
from
the
rites
and
sacrifices
which
are
offered
to
the
gods
below
in
places
where
three
ways
meet
on
earth
the
wise
and
orderly
soul
follows
in
the
straight
path
and
is
conscious
of
her
surroundings
but
the
soul
which
desires
the
body
and
which
as
i
was
relating
before
has
long
been
fluttering
about
the
lifeless
frame
and
the
world
of
sight
is
after
many
struggles
and
many
sufferings
hardly
and
with
violence
carried
away
by
her
attendant
genius
and
when
she
arrives
at
the
place
where
the
other
souls
are
gathered
if
she
be
impure
and
have
done
impure
deeds
whether
foul
murders
or
other
crimes
which
are
the
brothers
of
these
and
the
works
of
brothers
in
crime
from
that
soul
every
one
flees
and
turns
away
no
one
will
be
her
companion
no
one
her
guide
but
alone
she
wanders
in
extremity
of
evil
until
certain
times
are
fulfilled
and
when
they
are
fulfilled
she
is
borne
irresistibly
to
her
own
fitting
habitation
as
every
pure
and
just
soul
which
has
passed
through
life
in
the
company
and
under
the
guidance
of
the
gods
has
also
her
own
proper
home
now
the
earth
has
divers
wonderful
regions
and
is
indeed
in
nature
and
extent
very
unlike
the
notions
of
geographers
as
i
believe
on
the
authority
of
one
who
shall
be
nameless
what
do
you
mean
socrates
said
simmias
i
have
myself
heard
many
descriptions
of
the
earth
but
i
do
not
know
and
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
in
which
of
these
you
put
faith
and
i
simmias
replied
socrates
if
i
had
the
art
of
glaucus
would
tell
you
although
i
know
not
that
the
art
of
glaucus
could
prove
the
truth
of
my
tale
which
i
myself
should
never
be
able
to
prove
and
even
if
i
could
i
fear
simmias
that
my
life
would
come
to
an
end
before
the
argument
was
completed
i
may
describe
to
you
however
the
form
and
regions
of
the
earth
according
to
my
conception
of
them
that
said
simmias
will
be
enough
well
then
he
said
my
conviction
is
that
the
earth
is
a
round
body
in
the
centre
of
the
heavens
and
therefore
has
no
need
of
air
or
any
similar
force
to
be
a
support
but
is
kept
there
and
hindered
from
falling
or
inclining
any
way
by
the
equability
of
the
surrounding
heaven
and
by
her
own
equipoise
for
that
which
being
in
equipoise
is
in
the
centre
of
that
which
is
equably
diffused
will
not
incline
any
way
in
any
degree
but
will
always
remain
in
the
same
state
and
not
deviate
and
this
is
my
first
notion
which
is
surely
a
correct
one
said
simmias
also
i
believe
that
the
earth
is
very
vast
and
that
we
who
dwell
in
the
region
extending
from
the
river
phasis
to
the
pillars
of
heracles
inhabit
a
small
portion
only
about
the
sea
like
ants
or
frogs
about
a
marsh
and
that
there
are
other
inhabitants
of
many
other
like
places
for
everywhere
on
the
face
of
the
earth
there
are
hollows
of
various
forms
and
sizes
into
which
the
water
and
the
mist
and
the
lower
air
collect
but
the
true
earth
is
pure
and
situated
in
the
pure
heaven
there
are
the
stars
also
and
it
is
the
heaven
which
is
commonly
spoken
of
by
us
as
the
ether
and
of
which
our
own
earth
is
the
sediment
gathering
in
the
hollows
beneath
but
we
who
live
in
these
hollows
are
deceived
into
the
notion
that
we
are
dwelling
above
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
which
is
just
as
if
a
creature
who
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
were
to
fancy
that
he
was
on
the
surface
of
the
water
and
that
the
sea
was
the
heaven
through
which
he
saw
the
sun
and
the
other
stars
he
having
never
come
to
the
surface
by
reason
of
his
feebleness
and
sluggishness
and
having
never
lifted
up
his
head
and
seen
nor
ever
heard
from
one
who
had
seen
how
much
purer
and
fairer
the
world
above
is
than
his
own
and
such
is
exactly
our
case
for
we
are
dwelling
in
a
hollow
of
the
earth
and
fancy
that
we
are
on
the
surface
and
the
air
we
call
the
heaven
in
which
we
imagine
that
the
stars
move
but
the
fact
is
that
owing
to
our
feebleness
and
sluggishness
we
are
prevented
from
reaching
the
surface
of
the
air
for
if
any
man
could
arrive
at
the
exterior
limit
or
take
the
wings
of
a
bird
and
come
to
the
top
then
like
a
fish
who
puts
his
head
out
of
the
water
and
sees
this
world
he
would
see
a
world
beyond
and
if
the
nature
of
man
could
sustain
the
sight
he
would
acknowledge
that
this
other
world
was
the
place
of
the
true
heaven
and
the
true
light
and
the
true
earth
for
our
earth
and
the
stones
and
the
entire
region
which
surrounds
us
are
spoilt
and
corroded
as
in
the
sea
all
things
are
corroded
by
the
brine
neither
is
there
any
noble
or
perfect
growth
but
caverns
only
and
sand
and
an
endless
slough
of
mud
and
even
the
shore
is
not
to
be
compared
to
the
fairer
sights
of
this
world
and
still
less
is
this
our
world
to
be
compared
with
the
other
of
that
upper
earth
which
is
under
the
heaven
i
can
tell
you
a
charming
tale
simmias
which
is
well
worth
hearing
and
we
socrates
replied
simmias
shall
be
charmed
to
listen
to
you
the
tale
my
friend
he
said
is
as
follows
in
the
first
place
the
earth
when
looked
at
from
above
is
in
appearance
streaked
like
one
of
those
balls
which
have
leather
coverings
in
twelve
pieces
and
is
decked
with
various
colours
of
which
the
colours
used
by
painters
on
earth
are
in
a
manner
samples
but
there
the
whole
earth
is
made
up
of
them
and
they
are
brighter
far
and
clearer
than
ours
there
is
a
purple
of
wonderful
lustre
also
the
radiance
of
gold
and
the
white
which
is
in
the
earth
is
whiter
than
any
chalk
or
snow
of
these
and
other
colours
the
earth
is
made
up
and
they
are
more
in
number
and
fairer
than
the
eye
of
man
has
ever
seen
the
very
hollows
of
which
i
was
speaking
filled
with
air
and
water
have
a
colour
of
their
own
and
are
seen
like
light
gleaming
amid
the
diversity
of
the
other
colours
so
that
the
whole
presents
a
single
and
continuous
appearance
of
variety
in
unity
and
in
this
fair
region
everything
that
grows
trees
and
flowers
and
fruits
are
in
a
like
degree
fairer
than
any
here
and
there
are
hills
having
stones
in
them
in
a
like
degree
smoother
and
more
transparent
and
fairer
in
colour
than
our
emeralds
and
sardonyxes
and
jaspers
and
other
gems
which
are
but
minute
fragments
of
them
for
there
all
the
stones
are
like
our
precious
stones
and
fairer
still
compare
republic
the
reason
is
that
they
are
pure
and
not
like
our
precious
stones
infected
or
corroded
by
the
corrupt
briny
elements
which
coagulate
among
us
and
which
breed
foulness
and
disease
both
in
earth
and
stones
as
well
as
in
animals
and
plants
they
are
the
jewels
of
the
upper
earth
which
also
shines
with
gold
and
silver
and
the
like
and
they
are
set
in
the
light
of
day
and
are
large
and
abundant
and
in
all
places
making
the
earth
a
sight
to
gladden
the
beholder
eye
and
there
are
animals
and
men
some
in
a
middle
region
others
dwelling
about
the
air
as
we
dwell
about
the
sea
others
in
islands
which
the
air
flows
round
near
the
continent
and
in
a
word
the
air
is
used
by
them
as
the
water
and
the
sea
are
by
us
and
the
ether
is
to
them
what
the
air
is
to
us
moreover
the
temperament
of
their
seasons
is
such
that
they
have
no
disease
and
live
much
longer
than
we
do
and
have
sight
and
hearing
and
smell
and
all
the
other
senses
in
far
greater
perfection
in
the
same
proportion
that
air
is
purer
than
water
or
the
ether
than
air
also
they
have
temples
and
sacred
places
in
which
the
gods
really
dwell
and
they
hear
their
voices
and
receive
their
answers
and
are
conscious
of
them
and
hold
converse
with
them
and
they
see
the
sun
moon
and
stars
as
they
truly
are
and
their
other
blessedness
is
of
a
piece
with
this
such
is
the
nature
of
the
whole
earth
and
of
the
things
which
are
around
the
earth
and
there
are
divers
regions
in
the
hollows
on
the
face
of
the
globe
everywhere
some
of
them
deeper
and
more
extended
than
that
which
we
inhabit
others
deeper
but
with
a
narrower
opening
than
ours
and
some
are
shallower
and
also
wider
all
have
numerous
perforations
and
there
are
passages
broad
and
narrow
in
the
interior
of
the
earth
connecting
them
with
one
another
and
there
flows
out
of
and
into
them
as
into
basins
a
vast
tide
of
water
and
huge
subterranean
streams
of
perennial
rivers
and
springs
hot
and
cold
and
a
great
fire
and
great
rivers
of
fire
and
streams
of
liquid
mud
thin
or
thick
like
the
rivers
of
mud
in
sicily
and
the
lava
streams
which
follow
them
and
the
regions
about
which
they
happen
to
flow
are
filled
up
with
them
and
there
is
a
swinging
or
in
the
interior
of
the
earth
which
moves
all
this
up
and
down
and
is
due
to
the
following
cause
there
is
a
chasm
which
is
the
vastest
of
them
all
and
pierces
right
through
the
whole
earth
this
is
that
chasm
which
homer
describes
in
the
words
off
where
is
the
inmost
depth
beneath
the
earth
and
which
he
in
other
places
and
many
other
poets
have
called
tartarus
and
the
is
caused
by
the
streams
flowing
into
and
out
of
this
chasm
and
they
each
have
the
nature
of
the
soil
through
which
they
flow
and
the
reason
why
the
streams
are
always
flowing
in
and
out
is
that
the
watery
element
has
no
bed
or
bottom
but
is
swinging
and
surging
up
and
down
and
the
surrounding
wind
and
air
do
the
same
they
follow
the
water
up
and
down
hither
and
thither
over
the
earth
just
as
in
the
act
of
respiration
the
air
is
always
in
process
of
inhalation
and
exhalation
and
the
wind
swinging
with
the
water
in
and
out
produces
fearful
and
irresistible
blasts
when
the
waters
retire
with
a
rush
into
the
lower
parts
of
the
earth
as
they
are
called
they
flow
through
the
earth
in
those
regions
and
fill
them
up
like
water
raised
by
a
pump
and
then
when
they
leave
those
regions
and
rush
back
hither
they
again
fill
the
hollows
here
and
when
these
are
filled
flow
through
subterranean
channels
and
find
their
way
to
their
several
places
forming
seas
and
lakes
and
rivers
and
springs
thence
they
again
enter
the
earth
some
of
them
making
a
long
circuit
into
many
lands
others
going
to
a
few
places
and
not
so
distant
and
again
fall
into
tartarus
some
at
a
point
a
good
deal
lower
than
that
at
which
they
rose
and
others
not
much
lower
but
all
in
some
degree
lower
than
the
point
from
which
they
came
and
some
burst
forth
again
on
the
opposite
side
and
some
on
the
same
side
and
some
wind
round
the
earth
with
one
or
many
folds
like
the
coils
of
a
serpent
and
descend
as
far
as
they
can
but
always
return
and
fall
into
the
chasm
the
rivers
flowing
in
either
direction
can
descend
only
to
the
centre
and
no
further
for
opposite
to
the
rivers
is
a
precipice
now
these
rivers
are
many
and
mighty
and
diverse
and
there
are
four
principal
ones
of
which
the
greatest
and
outermost
is
that
called
oceanus
which
flows
round
the
earth
in
a
circle
and
in
the
opposite
direction
flows
acheron
which
passes
under
the
earth
through
desert
places
into
the
acherusian
lake
this
is
the
lake
to
the
shores
of
which
the
souls
of
the
many
go
when
they
are
dead
and
after
waiting
an
appointed
time
which
is
to
some
a
longer
and
to
some
a
shorter
time
they
are
sent
back
to
be
born
again
as
animals
the
third
river
passes
out
between
the
two
and
near
the
place
of
outlet
pours
into
a
vast
region
of
fire
and
forms
a
lake
larger
than
the
mediterranean
sea
boiling
with
water
and
mud
and
proceeding
muddy
and
turbid
and
winding
about
the
earth
comes
among
other
places
to
the
extremities
of
the
acherusian
lake
but
mingles
not
with
the
waters
of
the
lake
and
after
making
many
coils
about
the
earth
plunges
into
tartarus
at
a
deeper
level
this
is
that
pyriphlegethon
as
the
stream
is
called
which
throws
up
jets
of
fire
in
different
parts
of
the
earth
the
fourth
river
goes
out
on
the
opposite
side
and
falls
first
of
all
into
a
wild
and
savage
region
which
is
all
of
a
colour
like
lapis
lazuli
and
this
is
that
river
which
is
called
the
stygian
river
and
falls
into
and
forms
the
lake
styx
and
after
falling
into
the
lake
and
receiving
strange
powers
in
the
waters
passes
under
the
earth
winding
round
in
the
opposite
direction
and
comes
near
the
acherusian
lake
from
the
opposite
side
to
pyriphlegethon
and
the
water
of
this
river
too
mingles
with
no
other
but
flows
round
in
a
circle
and
falls
into
tartarus
over
against
pyriphlegethon
and
the
name
of
the
river
as
the
poets
say
is
cocytus
such
is
the
nature
of
the
other
world
and
when
the
dead
arrive
at
the
place
to
which
the
genius
of
each
severally
guides
them
first
of
all
they
have
sentence
passed
upon
them
as
they
have
lived
well
and
piously
or
not
and
those
who
appear
to
have
lived
neither
well
nor
ill
go
to
the
river
acheron
and
embarking
in
any
vessels
which
they
may
find
are
carried
in
them
to
the
lake
and
there
they
dwell
and
are
purified
of
their
evil
deeds
and
having
suffered
the
penalty
of
the
wrongs
which
they
have
done
to
others
they
are
absolved
and
receive
the
rewards
of
their
good
deeds
each
of
them
according
to
his
deserts
but
those
who
appear
to
be
incurable
by
reason
of
the
greatness
of
their
crimes
who
have
committed
many
and
terrible
deeds
of
sacrilege
murders
foul
and
violent
or
the
like
such
are
hurled
into
tartarus
which
is
their
suitable
destiny
and
they
never
come
out
those
again
who
have
committed
crimes
which
although
great
are
not
irremediable
who
in
a
moment
of
anger
for
example
have
done
violence
to
a
father
or
a
mother
and
have
repented
for
the
remainder
of
their
lives
or
who
have
taken
the
life
of
another
under
the
like
extenuating
circumstances
these
are
plunged
into
tartarus
the
pains
of
which
they
are
compelled
to
undergo
for
a
year
but
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
wave
casts
them
forth
mere
homicides
by
way
of
cocytus
parricides
and
matricides
by
pyriphlegethon
and
they
are
borne
to
the
acherusian
lake
and
there
they
lift
up
their
voices
and
call
upon
the
victims
whom
they
have
slain
or
wronged
to
have
pity
on
them
and
to
be
kind
to
them
and
let
them
come
out
into
the
lake
and
if
they
prevail
then
they
come
forth
and
cease
from
their
troubles
but
if
not
they
are
carried
back
again
into
tartarus
and
from
thence
into
the
rivers
unceasingly
until
they
obtain
mercy
from
those
whom
they
have
wronged
for
that
is
the
sentence
inflicted
upon
them
by
their
judges
those
too
who
have
been
for
holiness
of
life
are
released
from
this
earthly
prison
and
go
to
their
pure
home
which
is
above
and
dwell
in
the
purer
earth
and
of
these
such
as
have
duly
purified
themselves
with
philosophy
live
henceforth
altogether
without
the
body
in
mansions
fairer
still
which
may
not
be
described
and
of
which
the
time
would
fail
me
to
tell
wherefore
simmias
seeing
all
these
things
what
ought
not
we
to
do
that
we
may
obtain
virtue
and
wisdom
in
this
life
fair
is
the
prize
and
the
hope
great
a
man
of
sense
ought
not
to
say
nor
will
i
be
very
confident
that
the
description
which
i
have
given
of
the
soul
and
her
mansions
is
exactly
true
but
i
do
say
that
inasmuch
as
the
soul
is
shown
to
be
immortal
he
may
venture
to
think
not
improperly
or
unworthily
that
something
of
the
kind
is
true
the
venture
is
a
glorious
one
and
he
ought
to
comfort
himself
with
words
like
these
which
is
the
reason
why
i
lengthen
out
the
tale
wherefore
i
say
let
a
man
be
of
good
cheer
about
his
soul
who
having
cast
away
the
pleasures
and
ornaments
of
the
body
as
alien
to
him
and
working
harm
rather
than
good
has
sought
after
the
pleasures
of
knowledge
and
has
arrayed
the
soul
not
in
some
foreign
attire
but
in
her
own
proper
jewels
temperance
and
justice
and
courage
and
nobility
and
truth
in
these
adorned
she
is
ready
to
go
on
her
journey
to
the
world
below
when
her
hour
comes
you
simmias
and
cebes
and
all
other
men
will
depart
at
some
time
or
other
me
already
as
the
tragic
poet
would
say
the
voice
of
fate
calls
soon
i
must
drink
the
poison
and
i
think
that
i
had
better
repair
to
the
bath
first
in
order
that
the
women
may
not
have
the
trouble
of
washing
my
body
after
i
am
dead
when
he
had
done
speaking
crito
said
and
have
you
any
commands
for
us
socrates
anything
to
say
about
your
children
or
any
other
matter
in
which
we
can
serve
you
nothing
particular
crito
he
replied
only
as
i
have
always
told
you
take
care
of
yourselves
that
is
a
service
which
you
may
be
ever
rendering
to
me
and
mine
and
to
all
of
us
whether
you
promise
to
do
so
or
not
but
if
you
have
no
thought
for
yourselves
and
care
not
to
walk
according
to
the
rule
which
i
have
prescribed
for
you
not
now
for
the
first
time
however
much
you
may
profess
or
promise
at
the
moment
it
will
be
of
no
avail
we
will
do
our
best
said
crito
and
in
what
way
shall
we
bury
you
in
any
way
that
you
like
but
you
must
get
hold
of
me
and
take
care
that
i
do
not
run
away
from
you
then
he
turned
to
us
and
added
with
a
smile
i
can
not
make
crito
believe
that
i
am
the
same
socrates
who
have
been
talking
and
conducting
the
argument
he
fancies
that
i
am
the
other
socrates
whom
he
will
soon
see
a
dead
body
and
he
asks
how
shall
he
bury
me
and
though
i
have
spoken
many
words
in
the
endeavour
to
show
that
when
i
have
drunk
the
poison
i
shall
leave
you
and
go
to
the
joys
of
the
blessed
these
words
of
mine
with
which
i
was
comforting
you
and
myself
have
had
as
i
perceive
no
effect
upon
crito
and
therefore
i
want
you
to
be
surety
for
me
to
him
now
as
at
the
trial
he
was
surety
to
the
judges
for
me
but
let
the
promise
be
of
another
sort
for
he
was
surety
for
me
to
the
judges
that
i
would
remain
and
you
must
be
my
surety
to
him
that
i
shall
not
remain
but
go
away
and
depart
and
then
he
will
suffer
less
at
my
death
and
not
be
grieved
when
he
sees
my
body
being
burned
or
buried
i
would
not
have
him
sorrow
at
my
hard
lot
or
say
at
the
burial
thus
we
lay
out
socrates
or
thus
we
follow
him
to
the
grave
or
bury
him
for
false
words
are
not
only
evil
in
themselves
but
they
infect
the
soul
with
evil
be
of
good
cheer
then
my
dear
crito
and
say
that
you
are
burying
my
body
only
and
do
with
that
whatever
is
usual
and
what
you
think
best
when
he
had
spoken
these
words
he
arose
and
went
into
a
chamber
to
bathe
crito
followed
him
and
told
us
to
wait
so
we
remained
behind
talking
and
thinking
of
the
subject
of
discourse
and
also
of
the
greatness
of
our
sorrow
he
was
like
a
father
of
whom
we
were
being
bereaved
and
we
were
about
to
pass
the
rest
of
our
lives
as
orphans
when
he
had
taken
the
bath
his
children
were
brought
to
him
he
had
two
young
sons
and
an
elder
one
and
the
women
of
his
family
also
came
and
he
talked
to
them
and
gave
them
a
few
directions
in
the
presence
of
crito
then
he
dismissed
them
and
returned
to
us
now
the
hour
of
sunset
was
near
for
a
good
deal
of
time
had
passed
while
he
was
within
when
he
came
out
he
sat
down
with
us
again
after
his
bath
but
not
much
was
said
soon
the
jailer
who
was
the
servant
of
the
eleven
entered
and
stood
by
him
saying
to
you
socrates
whom
i
know
to
be
the
noblest
and
gentlest
and
best
of
all
who
ever
came
to
this
place
i
will
not
impute
the
angry
feelings
of
other
men
who
rage
and
swear
at
me
when
in
obedience
to
the
authorities
i
bid
them
drink
the
poison
indeed
i
am
sure
that
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
for
others
as
you
are
aware
and
not
i
are
to
blame
and
so
fare
you
well
and
try
to
bear
lightly
what
must
needs
be
you
know
my
errand
then
bursting
into
tears
he
turned
away
and
went
out
socrates
looked
at
him
and
said
i
return
your
good
wishes
and
will
do
as
you
bid
then
turning
to
us
he
said
how
charming
the
man
is
since
i
have
been
in
prison
he
has
always
been
coming
to
see
me
and
at
times
he
would
talk
to
me
and
was
as
good
to
me
as
could
be
and
now
see
how
generously
he
sorrows
on
my
account
we
must
do
as
he
says
crito
and
therefore
let
the
cup
be
brought
if
the
poison
is
prepared
if
not
let
the
attendant
prepare
some
yet
said
crito
the
sun
is
still
upon
the
and
i
know
that
many
a
one
has
taken
the
draught
late
and
after
the
announcement
has
been
made
to
him
he
has
eaten
and
drunk
and
enjoyed
the
society
of
his
beloved
do
not
hurry
there
is
time
enough
socrates
said
yes
crito
and
they
of
whom
you
speak
are
right
in
so
acting
for
they
think
that
they
will
be
gainers
by
the
delay
but
i
am
right
in
not
following
their
example
for
i
do
not
think
that
i
should
gain
anything
by
drinking
the
poison
a
little
later
i
should
only
be
ridiculous
in
my
own
eyes
for
sparing
and
saving
a
life
which
is
already
forfeit
please
then
to
do
as
i
say
and
not
to
refuse
me
crito
made
a
sign
to
the
servant
who
was
standing
by
and
he
went
out
and
having
been
absent
for
some
time
returned
with
the
jailer
carrying
the
cup
of
poison
socrates
said
you
my
good
friend
who
are
experienced
in
these
matters
shall
give
me
directions
how
i
am
to
proceed
the
man
answered
you
have
only
to
walk
about
until
your
legs
are
heavy
and
then
to
lie
down
and
the
poison
will
act
at
the
same
time
he
handed
the
cup
to
socrates
who
in
the
easiest
and
gentlest
manner
without
the
least
fear
or
change
of
colour
or
feature
looking
at
the
man
with
all
his
eyes
echecrates
as
his
manner
was
took
the
cup
and
said
what
do
you
say
about
making
a
libation
out
of
this
cup
to
any
god
may
i
or
not
the
man
answered
we
only
prepare
socrates
just
so
much
as
we
deem
enough
i
understand
he
said
but
i
may
and
must
ask
the
gods
to
prosper
my
journey
from
this
to
the
other
world
even
so
and
so
be
it
according
to
my
prayer
then
raising
the
cup
to
his
lips
quite
readily
and
cheerfully
he
drank
off
the
poison
and
hitherto
most
of
us
had
been
able
to
control
our
sorrow
but
now
when
we
saw
him
drinking
and
saw
too
that
he
had
finished
the
draught
we
could
no
longer
forbear
and
in
spite
of
myself
my
own
tears
were
flowing
fast
so
that
i
covered
my
face
and
wept
not
for
him
but
at
the
thought
of
my
own
calamity
in
having
to
part
from
such
a
friend
nor
was
i
the
first
for
crito
when
he
found
himself
unable
to
restrain
his
tears
had
got
up
and
i
followed
and
at
that
moment
apollodorus
who
had
been
weeping
all
the
time
broke
out
in
a
loud
and
passionate
cry
which
made
cowards
of
us
all
socrates
alone
retained
his
calmness
what
is
this
strange
outcry
he
said
i
sent
away
the
women
mainly
in
order
that
they
might
not
misbehave
in
this
way
for
i
have
been
told
that
a
man
should
die
in
peace
be
quiet
then
and
have
patience
when
we
heard
his
words
we
were
ashamed
and
refrained
our
tears
and
he
walked
about
until
as
he
said
his
legs
began
to
fail
and
then
he
lay
on
his
back
according
to
the
directions
and
the
man
who
gave
him
the
poison
now
and
then
looked
at
his
feet
and
legs
and
after
a
while
he
pressed
his
foot
hard
and
asked
him
if
he
could
feel
and
he
said
no
and
then
his
leg
and
so
upwards
and
upwards
and
showed
us
that
he
was
cold
and
stiff
and
he
felt
them
himself
and
said
when
the
poison
reaches
the
heart
that
will
be
the
end
he
was
beginning
to
grow
cold
about
the
groin
when
he
uncovered
his
face
for
he
had
covered
himself
up
and
said
they
were
his
last
words
he
said
crito
i
owe
a
cock
to
asclepius
will
you
remember
to
pay
the
debt
the
debt
shall
be
paid
said
crito
is
there
anything
else
there
was
no
answer
to
this
question
but
in
a
minute
or
two
a
movement
was
heard
and
the
attendants
uncovered
him
his
eyes
were
set
and
crito
closed
his
eyes
and
mouth
such
was
the
end
echecrates
of
our
friend
concerning
whom
i
may
truly
say
that
of
all
the
men
of
his
time
whom
i
have
known
he
was
the
wisest
and
justest
and
best
